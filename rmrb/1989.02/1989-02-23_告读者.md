Despite the lack of a unanimous understanding of the causes and differing views on future plans, no one can avoid the objective reality that since 1984, when China's grain and cotton production reached a new level, it has fluctuated for the past four years, falling into a new state of stagnation. The production of major agricultural products such as oilseeds, sugarcane, pigs, silkworms, and tea has also experienced significant fluctuations. The stagnation in agriculture, especially in grain and cotton production, is increasingly affecting the healthy development of the entire national economy. Therefore, how to effectively reverse this passive situation has once again become a "hot" issue that the entire society is focusing on.

It is against this backdrop that the editorial department of this newspaper and the Ministry of Agriculture have decided to jointly organize a discussion on agricultural development issues, with the theme being: How to break through the stagnation as soon as possible?

Agricultural issues are issues for the entire society and require the attention and support of the entire society. This discussion column is naturally open to the entire society. Experts and scholars can share their views; grassroots cadres and ordinary farmers can also discuss their personal thoughts; those engaged in agriculture have a duty to participate actively; colleagues from other departments, as impartial observers, can also comment. In short, we provide this platform and welcome everyone to combine their actual experiences and actively share their insights. Discussion, of course, includes debate. Only by fully engaging in the exchange of ideas can we better achieve the goal of collective wisdom. Therefore, we will strive to objectively select and publish articles with different viewpoints. And the articles published in this column, regardless of the author's profession and position, can only be considered as "one person's opinion." The purpose of doing this is only one: to add real effort to the development of China's agriculture.

Please send your manuscripts to the Rural Group of the Economic Department of this newspaper.

专栏：

　　告读者
    尽管对原因还未取得完全一致的认识，尽管对未来的设计也还不尽相同，但谁也回避不了这样的客观现实：我国的粮棉生产，自一九八四年登上一个新台阶以后，已经连续四年时上时下，陷入一种新的徘徊之中了。油料、糖料、生猪、桑蚕、茶叶等大宗农产品的生产也出现了较大波动。农业，特别是粮棉生产的徘徊，已越来越明显地影响着整个国民经济的健康发展。因而，如何有效扭转这种被动局面，再次成了为全社会所瞩目的“热点”问题。
    就是在这种背景下，本报编辑部与农业部决定联合组织一次关于农业发展问题的讨论，主题就是：如何尽快突破徘徊？
    农业问题，是全社会的问题，需要全社会的关心与支持。我们这个讨论专栏，自然是面向全社会开办的。专家、学者可以亮一亮自己的观点；基层干部、普通农民也可以谈谈个人的想法；从事农业的同志，积极参与，义不容辞；其他部门的同志，旁观者清，也不妨议论一番。总之，我们提供这样一个园地，欢迎大家结合实际，踊跃发表高见。讨论，当然包含着争论。只有充分展开观点交锋，才更易达到集思广益的目的。因此，我们将力争客观地选择发表不同观点的文章。而在本栏内发表的文章，无论作者的职业和职务如何，都只能视为“一家之言”。这样做的目的只有一个：就是要给我国的农业发展加上一把实劲。
