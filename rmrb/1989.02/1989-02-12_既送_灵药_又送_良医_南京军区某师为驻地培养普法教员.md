The People's Daily reports: Recently, a certain division of the Nanjing Military Region released a series of figures: Last year, the crime rate among the local population was 0%; the rate of petty theft, fighting, and civil disputes such as property and marriage was only 0.8% of the local population; 16 villages and towns were rated as "civilized units"; 8 farmers who had studied at the division's legal education training class obtained lawyer qualifications after being assessed by the judicial department; 40 farmers were rated as "excellent legal propagandists"; by the end of January, the division had completed its 20th "local legal education teacher training class," training 2,000 local legal education teachers. Through this, the division achieved the goal of "providing both miracle medicine and skilled doctors" in the process of helping the local area with legal education.

In the past, this division focused on helping the local area eliminate legal illiteracy in legal education. Later, it was found that although many people understood some legal knowledge, those who could correctly use legal weapons to protect themselves and maintain others were few and far between. Starting last year, this division changed its old methods and invested a lot of effort in training legal education teachers for the local population. The division's political department selected 10 officers who had studied law at local universities to serve as teachers and established 4 "local legal education teacher training classes" in different areas. The training classes offered 12 professional courses, including "Criminal Law." While teaching students legal knowledge, the training classes also conducted ideological and political education, making the students not only strengthen their legal awareness but also their confidence in maintaining social stability and contributing to national construction. Batch after batch of graduates became the backbone of legal education in the local area, and many also served as legal propagandists and civil mediators. They were active among the people, always propagating legal knowledge to the people and providing legal consultations. Last year, the division's party committee learned that a village had strong clan consciousness, so they selected two high school graduates from the village to study at the legal education teacher training class. After returning to the village, they used their legal knowledge to help villagers break away from feudal customs, and the village's customs changed. The previous saying "family laws are as heavy as mountains, clan rules must not be violated" was replaced by a strong sense of legal awareness.

　　既送“灵药”　又送“良医”    
    南京军区某师为驻地培养普法教员
    本报讯  南京军区某师近日传出这样一串数字：去年驻地群众中刑事案件发生率是０；小偷小摸、打架斗殴、房产婚姻等民事纠纷发生率仅占驻地人口的０．８％；１６个村镇被评为“文明单位”；８名曾在该师普法教员训练班学习过的农民经司法部门考核取得律师资格；４０名农民被评为“优秀法制宣传员”；到元月底，该师已结束第２０期“驻地普法教员训练班”，为驻地培养普法教员２０００人次。由此，该师实现了在帮助驻地普法过程中“既送灵药，也送良医”的目标。
    过去，这个师在帮助驻地普法学习中，把功夫下在帮助驻地扫除法盲上。后来发现不少人虽然懂得了一些法律知识，能正确运用法律武器保护自己、维护他人的人却寥寥无几。前年起，这个师改变了过去的老做法，花大气力为驻地群众培养普法教员。师政治机关从各单位抽１０名从地方大学法律系入伍的干部当教员，分片办起４个“驻地普法教员训练班”。训练班开设《刑法》等１２门专业课程。训练班在教授学员法律知识的同时，还对他们进行思想政治教育，使学员们既增强了法律意识，也增强了维护社会安定、投身国家建设的信心。一批批学员结业后，成了驻地普法骨干，不少人还兼任法制宣传员。民事调解员。他们活跃在群众中，随时向群众宣传法律知识，为群众提供法律咨询。去年，师党委了解到有一个村宗族观念盛行，便把村里两名高中毕业的农民抽到普法教员训练班学习。他们回到村里后，运用掌握的法律知识帮助村民们破除封建习俗，这个村的风气有了变化，以前信守的“家法重如山，族规不敢违”的信条，被浓厚的法制观念所代替。
