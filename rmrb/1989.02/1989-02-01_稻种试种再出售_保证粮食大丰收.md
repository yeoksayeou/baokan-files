Testing and Selling Rice Seeds to Ensure a Bumper Harvest

In recent years, the seed market in our county has been chaotic, with counterfeit and substandard seeds causing great harm to farmers. In 1987, due to seed issues, the entire county's 8,000 mu of late rice experienced a reduction of 1.57 million kilograms in yield. To prevent counterfeit and substandard seeds from harming farmers, in November 1987, our county's seed company sent personnel with seeds harvested by 72 households of farmers to Hainan Island for testing and identification. They eliminated seeds that did not meet quality standards, eradicating substandard seeds before they reached the market. From winter 1987 to spring 1988, the 45,000 kilograms of early-season hybrid rice seeds they sold resulted in generally good harvests, with yields averaging 450 kilograms per mu. The 640,000 kilograms of hybrid late-season rice seeds sold also produced bountiful harvests, with yields averaging 460 kilograms per mu, and the highest yield reaching 520 kilograms per mu. To ensure steady grain production across the county, on September 20, 1988, a deputy manager and two technical staff from our county's seed company took rice seeds harvested by 884 households of farmers to Sanya City, Hainan Province, for testing and identification.

Conducting one round of testing and identification takes four months and costs over 13,000 yuan in testing fees. The manager of our county's seed company said, "Although this is a significant expense, as long as the seeds are identified correctly, farmers will see increased income next year, and we will consider the extra spending worthwhile."

　　稻种试种再出售  保证粮食大丰收
    近几年来，我县的种子市场混乱，伪劣种子害苦了农民。一九八七年，全县八千多亩晚稻因种子问题减产一百五十七万公斤。为了防止伪劣种子坑农，一九八七年十一月，我县种子公司派人带着七十二户农民收获的种子，到海南岛试种鉴定。淘汰了未达到质量标准的种子，把劣种消灭在销售前。一九八七年冬天至一九八八年春天，他们销出的四万五千公斤早稻杂交种子，种后普遍获得好收成，一般亩产在四百五十公斤以上，售出的六十四万公斤杂交晚稻种，也都结出了硕果，一般亩产四百六十公斤，最高亩产达五百二十公斤。为使全县粮食稳步增长，一九八八年九月二十日，我县种子公司一位副经理和两名技术人员，又带着八百八十四户农民收获的稻种，到海南省三亚市试种鉴定。
    搞一次试种鉴定要四个月时间，花去试种费一万三千多元。我县种子公司经理说：“这虽然是一大笔开支，但只要种子鉴定好了，农民明年就会大增收，我们多花点钱也值得。”　　　　　　　　　　　湖南邵阳县委宣传部　肖雄伟
