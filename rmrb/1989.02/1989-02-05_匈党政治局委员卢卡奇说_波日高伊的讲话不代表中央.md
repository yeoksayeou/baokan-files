Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party Politburo member and Central Committee Secretary Lukács said yesterday at a meeting of activists in Budapest's First District that Pógyányi's speech on the radio was not the opinion of the Politburo or the Central Committee, but merely his personal opinion.

Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party Politburo member and State Secretary Pógyányi said in a radio broadcast on January 28 that a special committee of the Party Central Committee responsible for reviewing the history of Hungary after its liberation concluded that the 1956 events in Hungary were not a counter-revolutionary event, but a "people's uprising."

According to today's report in the Hungarian *Nép Szabadság* (People's Freedom), Lukács said at this meeting that the Central Committee plenary session to be held on February 10 will discuss this issue. He criticized certain Party leaders for "not firmly representing the stance of the Party Congress held last May."

According to another report, Party General Secretary Grósz pointed out on January 30 regarding Pógyányi's speech that conclusions on the re-evaluation of certain events in Hungary over the past 40 years cannot be made by one person or one committee, but should be made by the Central Committee. Politburo member and Prime Minister Németh stated that complex historical issues cannot be evaluated simply.

　　匈党政治局委员卢卡奇说
　　波日高伊的讲话不代表中央
    新华社布达佩斯２月２日电  匈牙利社会主义工人党政治局委员、中央书记卢卡奇昨天在布达佩斯第一区积极分子会议上说，波日高伊在广播电台的讲话不是政治局的意见，也不是中央委员会的意见，而只是他个人的意见。
    匈党政治局委员、政府国务部长波日高伊１月２８日在广播电台发表讲话时曾说，党中央的一个负责审查匈牙利解放后历史的专门委员会认为，匈牙利１９５６年事件不是反革命事件，而是“人民起义”。
    据匈《人民自由报》今天报道，卢卡奇在这次会议上说，２月１０日举行的中央全会将讨论这个问题。他批评党的某些领导人“未能坚定地代表去年５月党代表会议的立场”。
    另据报道，匈党总书记格罗斯１月３０日就波日高伊的讲话指出，对匈牙利过去４０年中某些事件重新评价的结论，不能由一个人或一个委员会做，而应当由中央委员会做。匈党政治局委员、政府总理内梅特表示，对复杂的历史问题不能作简单的评价。
