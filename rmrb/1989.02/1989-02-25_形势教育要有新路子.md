New approaches are needed for situation education. The People's Daily Commentator

"Our lectures do not require everyone to accept them. If you find them reasonable, accept them; if you don't, you can bring up your opinions for discussion and research." This was the opening remark made by the situation education lecture team of a certain garrison division in the Jinan Military Region.

This lecture team places great emphasis on investigation and research during situation education, focusing on issues that the masses discuss the most and have the most opinions about, providing convincing explanations. For example, in response to the question, "How did the 'wild horse' of prices run wild?" they explained three points: First, they discussed how China's long-standing price controls had made some commodity prices unreasonable, necessitating adjustments. However, certain units and individuals took advantage of this to raise prices arbitrarily, causing the "wild horse" of prices to run amok. Second, they pointed out that many people complain about low wages but engage in high consumption; they complain about the scarcity of vegetables but indulge in feasts; they complain about a decline in living standards but buy refrigerators and color TVs. Some soldiers, whose allowances are insufficient, ask their families for money to buy good cigarettes. Everyone is whipping the horse, so how can it not run wild? Third, they explained that the "three tigers" of economic overheating, group purchasing power, and a large amount of idle social funds are chasing the "wild horse," making it run wild. After hearing these three points, many officers and soldiers commented: In the past, whenever prices were mentioned, people would curse. Now, it seems that price increases are not solely due to reforms; the problem is complex and requires targeted rectification. Through this discussion, the soldiers' understanding naturally aligned with the resolutions of the 13th Party Congress, their morale improved, and they saw hope.

Situation education is challenging. Currently, when situation education is mentioned, some comrades feel it is old-fashioned: the content is mostly about "the situation is good, but there are many problems," "achievements are the main focus, difficulties are temporary"; the methods are mostly reading documents, newspapers, writing reflections, and recalling past hardships and sweet memories. The logic is well-known, the forms are repetitive, and anyone can easily spout a lot of words. Moreover, the central policies and leadership are frequently communicated to the masses through newspapers, radio, and television, increasing transparency. Those being educated know as much as others, so who would want to accept education based on second-hand materials and reports? In this context, situation education indeed needs to actively explore new approaches. Recently, the People's Daily published an article by Feng Yuzhong, President of Liaoning University, titled "Observing the Situation with the Correct Method," discussing the recognition of situation education among teachers and staff in universities. He proposed observing society and analyzing the situation from historical and global perspectives, using the analysis and discussion of the situation to invigorate the spirit, enhance the consciousness of reform and participation. Offices, factories, rural areas, and the military are different from universities, so the content and methods of situation education should not be exactly the same. In this regard, the exploration of the Jinan Military Region's garrison division is valuable, and their spirit is worth learning from. Studying their practices, at least the following points are enlightening:

First, they put down the attitude of imparting knowledge and created a democratic, equal, and harmonious atmosphere, making people willing to listen to their reports and read their materials. Only when ideas enter the ears and eyes can they enter the brain. As educators, they naturally have a more comprehensive and thorough understanding of the situation, knowing more principles, but situation problems are not something that can be fully explained by one person. This requires changing the past approach of "I lecture, you listen" to dialogue, discussion, and even debate, to achieve the goal of clarifying the principles.

Second, they do not speak in general terms but address specific problems. Through extensive investigation and research, they focus on issues that the masses care about the most, such as prices and party discipline, concentrating on analysis and striving to explain them thoroughly. This is more effective in solving practical problems than a comprehensive discussion that starts with the overthrow of the "Gang of Four" and goes through the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, from international to domestic, from politics to economics. Solving the problems that the masses discuss the most and have the most opinions about will make other problems easier to resolve.

Third, they avoid clichés and strive to present new ideas. The situation is constantly changing, and situation education cannot be repetitive. They not only strive to present new ideas but also use new language to attract the masses' interest and deepen their impressions.

Situation education is a field worth deep study. In the context of reform, situation education itself needs reform. We should adopt a reform mindset to actively explore new approaches to situation education.

　　形势教育要有新路子
    本报评论员
    “我们讲的不要求大家都接受，你们认为有道理就接受，认为没道理可以提出来商讨、研究。”这是济南军区某守备师形势教育宣讲组讲课前的开场白。
    这个宣讲组进行形势教育非常重视调查研究，注意针对群众议论最多、意见最大的问题进行有说服力的讲解。比如，针对“物价这匹‘野马’究竟是怎样狂奔起来的？”他们讲了三层意思：一是讲我国物价多年“一贯制”，使一些商品价格很不合理，应该作适当调整，但是某些单位和个人趁机“搭车”乱涨价，使物价这匹“野马”立足未稳被迫狂奔起来。二是讲许多人一面叫“工资低”，一面又“高消费”；一面喊“菜篮子紧”，一面又大吃大喝；一面叫生活水平下降，一面又大买冰箱、彩电。有的战士津贴费不够，就向家中伸手要钱买好烟吸。大家都在拿着鞭子赶，这匹“野马”怎能不狂奔？三是讲经济过热、集团购买力和大批社会闲散资金这“三只老虎”追得“野马”狂奔不止。听了这三层道理，不少干部战士议论说：过去一提物价就骂娘，现在想来，物价上涨的确不是改革造成的，问题很复杂，需要有针对性地进行整治。经过这番讨论，战士们的认识自然地统一到十三届三中全会的决议上去，心气顺了，也看到了希望。
    形势教育，难度很大。现在一说形势教育，有些同志感到是老一套：内容无非“形势大好，问题不少”，“成绩是主要的，困难是暂时的”；方法无非是念文件，读报纸，写心得，还有回忆对比，忆苦思甜，等等。道理众所周知，形式反复使用，要说，要写，谁都可以随口顺手来上一大套。何况，现在中央精神、中央领导通过报纸、广播、电视经常同群众见面，透明度增加，受教育的知道得不比别人少，谁还愿意再去接受那些照抄照转、照读照念的“二手材料”、“二手报告”的教育呢？在这种情况下进行形势教育确实要积极探索新路子。前不久，本报发表辽宁大学校长冯玉忠的文章《用正确的方法观察形势》，讲的是在高等学校里师生员工研讨形势的一些认识。他提出要从历史的角度、全球的角度观察社会、分析形势，通过对形势的分析和研讨，振奋精神，增强改革意识和参与意识。机关、工厂、农村、部队同大专院校不同，在形势教育的内容和方法上也不应完全一样。在这方面，济南军区某守备师的探索是可贵的，他们的精神是值得学习的。研究他们的做法，至少有以下几点给人以启发：
    一是放下了传道授业解惑的架子，创造出民主平等和谐的气氛，这就使人愿听他们的报告，愿看他们的材料。道理只有先入耳，入目，才能入脑。作为一个教育者，对形势自然要比群众有更全面、更透彻的了解，道理懂得要多一些，但是，形势问题不是哪一个人可以讲全讲透的，这就需要变过去那种“我打你通”、“我讲你听”为对话、讨论，甚至辩论，达到说清道理的目的。
    二是不泛泛而论，而是有针对性地解决问题。通过广泛的调查研究，抓住群众最关心的问题，比如物价、党风等问题，集中分析，争取讲透，这比那种一开口就从粉碎“四人帮”以来到十一届三中全会之后、从国际到国内、从政治到经济的全面铺开、综合论述，要解决实际问题。解决了群众议论最多、意见最大的问题，其它问题也就迎刃而解了。
    三是力避说老话套话，争取讲出新意。形势日新月异，形势教育也不能老调重弹，不但要争取讲出点新的意思，还要争取使用新的语言，引起群众的兴趣，加深群众的印象。
    形势教育也是一门学问，很值得深入研究。在改革的形势下进行形势教育，形势教育也要改革，我们要以改革的精神，去积极探索形势教育的新路子。
