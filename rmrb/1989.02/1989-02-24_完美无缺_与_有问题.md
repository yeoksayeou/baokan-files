A reporter from the *World Economic Herald* asked the U.S. Ambassador what he thought was the biggest change in China since his first visit. Winston Lord replied: "I think a healthy phenomenon is that people now admit there are problems rather than thinking everything is perfect. Twenty years ago, Chinese people always told foreigners there were no problems, everything was perfect and flawless."

This comment is very insightful. Lord is indeed an expert on China.

Lord first came to China in July 1971, during the Cultural Revolution. At that time, whenever the situation was mentioned, it was always described as "the situation is excellent, not just a little good, but very good." Moreover, it was said to be "getting better and better." In poetic language, it was described as "the birds singing and the swallows dancing." Ironically, beneath this facade of "everything being perfect and flawless," problems were rampant, crises were looming, and the society and economy were gradually heading towards collapse.

In the ten years following the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, we gradually overcame difficulties and embarked on a path of sustained and stable development. Reform and opening-up achieved remarkable successes that attracted worldwide attention. However, we do not claim that everything is perfect and flawless. Instead, we openly and frankly discuss serious issues such as inflation and corruption.

What a stark contrast!

This change is the inevitable result of restoring and developing the Marxist thought line of seeking truth from facts, integrating theory with practice, and starting from reality. However, people's understanding cannot be completely consistent, nor can it always be so clear. The Qing Dynasty scholar Qian Daxin said, "I can see others' mistakes, but I cannot see my own; I can point out others' minor mistakes, but I cannot see my own major mistakes." (*Collected Works of Qian Daxin, Yuyu*). Although this was said about scholarship, it is a universal truth and also applies to governance. In real life, it is often easier to see others' mistakes than to see one's own. The saying "those in charge are confused" refers to this. People may be intoxicated by their achievements, or may want to maintain some authority, or may be afraid of negating themselves... They often do not want to mention, or even face, their own shortcomings and mistakes, and they also oppose others pointing out these issues. If someone does, they may fly into a rage...

Human society advances in the development of contradictions. At any moment, no society can be "perfect and flawless." A perfect and flawless society only exists in "Utopia." No matter how superior a social system is, it will always have deficiencies and shortcomings. Concealing our deficiencies and problems may make our achievements seem brilliant for a while, maintaining honor and prestige, but deficiencies and problems are objectively existent. Whether people acknowledge them or not, they are there, playing a negative role. A thorough materialist should fear nothing, respect reality, face reality, acknowledge existing problems, and take positive attitudes to deal with them properly, thus avoiding being forced to accept bad consequences. Acknowledging problems is the starting point of progress.

The sweeping reform across the country is a revolution. This revolution is to find out our shortcomings, problems, and malpractices, and take effective measures to remove all old ideas, old things, and old orders that hinder our progress, replacing them with new ones, to facilitate the development of socialist commodity economy and the construction of socialist democratic politics. In a sense, the process of reform is the process of seeking out shortcomings, mistakes, and malpractices, and trying to overcome them.

To persist in reform, we must abandon the idea of "everything being perfect and flawless"!

To persist in reform, we must frankly and openly acknowledge our shortcomings, mistakes, and malpractices!

The change from "everything being perfect and flawless" to continuously acknowledging "having problems" is a welcome change. May this change last forever, and may it spread to all Chinese people!

### “完美无缺”与“有问题”

　　“完美无缺”与“有问题”
     徐逊
    《世界经济导报》记者问美国大使，自他首次访华以来，中国最大的变化是什么？温斯顿·洛德说：“我认为比较健康的现象，就是承认有问题而不是认为一切都很完美，而２０年前的中国人总是告诉外国人没问题，一切完美无缺。”
    这一评论是很有见地的，洛德不愧为中国通。
    洛德１９７１年７月第一次来中国，正值“文革”期间，当时提到形势总是说“形势大好，不是小好，而是大好”。而且是“越来越好”，用诗的语言说则是“莺歌燕舞”。恰恰在这“一切完美无缺”的掩盖下，问题丛生，危机四伏，社会经济日渐走向濒临崩溃的局面。
    十一届三中全会以后的１０年，我们逐步摆脱困境，走上持续稳定发展的道路，改革、开放取得举世瞩目的伟大成就，然而，并不认为一切完美无缺，相反地坦诚地公开议论诸如通货膨胀与腐败现象这类严峻的问题。
    多么强烈的对照。
    这个变化是恢复和发展了实事求是、理论联系实际、一切从实际出发的马克思主义思想路线的必然结果。但是，人们的认识不可能是那么完全一致的，也总不会都那么清醒的。清代学者钱大昕说过，“吾能知人之失，而不能见吾之失；吾能指人之小失，而不能见吾之大失。”（《潜研堂文集·奕喻》）这虽然说的是治学，却是通理，亦适用于治国。在现实生活中，往往是观人之失易，见己之失难，所谓“当局者迷”即指此。人们或陶醉于已有的成就，或为维护某一权威，或怕否定自己……往往不愿提，甚至不愿正视自己的缺点与错误，也反对别人提到这些，一提就暴跳如雷……
    人类社会总是在矛盾发展中有所发现、有所发明、有所创造、有所前进的。任何社会的任何瞬间都不可能是“一切完美无缺”的。一个完美无缺的社会只存在于“乌托邦”之中。一种社会制度不论它具有多大的优越性，总还有不足与缺失。讳言我们的缺失与问题，可能使我们的成绩一时之间显得光彩，维护了荣誉与威望，但缺失与问题是客观存在，不管人们承认不承认，总在那里起负面的作用。彻底的唯物主义者无所畏惧，应该尊重现实、正视现实，承认存在的问题，采取积极的态度予以妥善的处理，才能避免被迫接受恶果。承认有问题，是前进的起点。
    席卷神州大地的改革，是一场革命。这场革命就是要找出我们的不足、问题与弊端，采取有效的措施扫除妨碍我们前进的一切旧观念、旧事物、旧秩序，代之以新的，以利于社会主义商品经济的发展和社会主义民主政治的建设。从某种意义上讲，改革的过程就是寻求不足、失误与弊端，并设法予以克服的过程。
    坚持改革，就要抛弃“一切完美无缺”的观念！
    坚持改革，就得坦诚地公开我们的缺点、错误和弊端！
    从“一切完美无缺”到不断承认“有问题”，是可喜可贺的变化，愿这变化永存，愿这变化遍及所有的中国人！
