The Vienna Mid-European Balanced Arms Control Talks, which lasted for fifteen years without any results, concluded on the 2nd in Vienna.

Representatives from nineteen countries in the Warsaw Pact and NATO participated in the final plenary meeting. The _Final Communiqué_ unanimously adopted by the meeting pointed out that the Vienna Mid-European Arms Control Talks, which began in 1973, marked the start of a long-term serious dialogue between the East and West on security issues. It was the first multilateral negotiation in the process of strengthening European security and arms control. Although the representatives did not reach an agreement, their positions on many issues have come closer, providing experience for future arms control talks.

　　维也纳中欧裁军谈判结束
    历时十五年尚无任何结果的维也纳中欧均衡裁军谈判，二日在维也纳宣告结束。
    来自华约和北约十九个国家的代表参加了最后一次全体会议。会议一致通过的《最后公报》指出，自一九七三年开始的维也纳中欧裁军谈判成为东西方就安全问题进行长期认真对话的开端，是在加强欧洲安全与裁军进程中的第一个多边性谈判。与会代表虽未能达成协议，但双方的立场在许多问题上有所接近，为今后的裁军谈判取得了经验。
