	The North is frozen in ice and snow, while the South is warm like spring. Hainan's "big greenhouse" is actively breeding for other provinces and cities.

    This reporter, Luo Zi Su, reports: Just before the Spring Festival, while the North is frozen in ice and snow, the southern part of Hainan is lush and green.

    Since last winter, 27 provinces and cities across the country have sent personnel here for seed production. According to statistics from the agricultural department, the current seed production area has reached over 130,000 mu, and the seedlings are growing well.

    The southern region of Hainan, including Ledong, Lingao, and Sanya City, is a natural large greenhouse. As a traditional base for southern seed production in China, the state has invested over 15 million yuan to establish base facilities here. Due to the severe disasters in Hunan and Jiangxi last autumn, the production of hybrid rice seeds decreased, resulting in a national shortage of 60 million kilograms of hybrid seeds. The Ministry of Agriculture increased the planned area for southern seed production in Hainan this year from 45,000 mu to 120,000 mu, and sent Vice Minister Chen Yaobang to Hainan to inspect and guide this work. At the same time, 10,000 tons of fertilizer were allocated to support seed production. Hainan Province also attaches great importance to seed production. The provincial government allocated over 7 million yuan in interest-free loans under tight financial conditions, arranging for the Hainan Seed Company and the Hainan branch of the China Seed Company to use as seed production working capital. The entire province has produced seeds on 16,000 mu, with Qionghai, Lingao, Wanning, Lingao, Danzhou, and Sanya City producing over 5,000 mu of seeds at their own expense.

　　北国冰封雪飘　南国温暖如春
　　海南“大温室”积极为外省市育种
    本报讯  记者罗自苏报道：春节前夕，我国北方冰封雪飘之时，海南南部却正是一片葱绿。
    去冬以来，全国２７个省市派员来这里制种。据农业部门统计，目前制种面积已达１３万余亩，种苗长势看好。
    海南南部地区的乐东、陵水和三亚市是个天然大温室，作为我国传统的南繁制种基地，国家已对这里投资１５００多万元建立基地设施。因去秋湖南、江西等省灾害较重，杂交水稻制种减产，全国缺杂交种子６０００万公斤。农业部把原定今年在海南的南繁制种４．５万亩的计划面积增加到１２万亩，并派副部长陈耀邦到海南检查指导这项工作，同时下拨１万吨化肥支持制种。海南省对制种工作也很重视，省政府在紧缩银根的情况下拨出７００多万元贴息贷款，安排给海南省种子公司和中国种子公司海南分公司作为制种流动资金，全省已制种１．６万亩，其中琼海、陵水、万宁、临高、儋县和三亚市自费制种５０００多亩。
