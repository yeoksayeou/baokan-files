On February 3, the Café Royal Hotel in London was bustling with guests. The conference hall on the fourth floor of the hotel building was decorated with lanterns and flowers, and every seat was taken. The banner "China in the 1990s" on the stage was particularly eye-catching under the lights and flowers. As the Chinese Lunar New Year of the Snake approached, a grand spring discussion meeting organized by the London Export-Import Group and the Lovell, White, Durant Consulting Company was held here. Nearly 400 prominent figures from the British political and business circles attended the discussion meeting. British Transport Minister Norman Fowler and Chinese Ambassador to the UK Ji Zhaozhi spoke at the discussion meeting and the luncheon, respectively.

The organizers told the reporter that the "China in the 1990s" discussion meeting brought together all major official and non-official organizations in Britain to discuss the development of Sino-British economic and trade relations for the first time. Seven people, including the economic advisor of the Bank of China London Branch, the vice chairman of the British-China Trade Association, the vice chairman of the 48 Group, the chairman of the British-China Cultural Association, and the vice chairman of the British-China Understanding Association, gave systematic and lengthy speeches at the meeting. The Deputy Secretary of the British Overseas Development Department said about this discussion meeting that British companies would obtain clear information from the meeting on how to adapt to China's prosperous development in the next 10 years; similarly, the Chinese side would also gain a better understanding of the technologies, products, and services that Britain can provide to China, as well as the practical difficulties that may be encountered in entering the Chinese market.

Over the past 10 years, Sino-British economic and trade relations have been developing steadily and actively, which is a key theme of the discussion meeting. Britain is an important trading partner of China in Western Europe. Britain was the first Western power to relax its embargo on China, and the satisfactory resolution of the Hong Kong issue has opened up new avenues for the economic and trade relations between the two countries. The total trade volume between the two countries increased by 20% in 1985 compared to 1984, reaching $1.43 billion in 1987. The total trade volume between the two countries from January to October last year was $1.148 billion.

The discussion meeting emphasized that the potential for developing Sino-British trade is enormous, and the prospects are broad. Looking ahead to the Year of the Snake and the 1990s, the discussion meeting believed that the trade volume between the two countries could see a significant increase. According to a senior official of the British Overseas Trade Bureau, the Sino-British trade volume in the Year of the Snake would rise from 1% of Britain's total foreign trade to 3%. The 48 Group, which has played a "pioneering" role in Sino-British trade, stated that to support China's modernization plan, they would strive for the Sino-British trade volume to reach $5 billion. The discussion meeting revealed that a delegation consisting of more than 150 large enterprises organized by the group would be led by former British Prime Minister Edward Heath to visit China this year, conducting economic talks in various major cities. British Trade and Industry Minister Lord Young will visit China for the sixth time in April, aiming to promote the development of economic and trade cooperation. The Prince of Wales and Princess Diana will also visit China in November, and a large-scale British export trade exhibition will be held in Beijing at that time.

British Transport Minister Norman Fowler, who had just visited China in December last year, said in his keynote speech for the discussion meeting that the path for economic cooperation between Britain and China is broad, such as in the fields of port construction, road and railway construction, and traffic control systems, British companies face enormous opportunities.

"Historically, the Year of the Snake is considered a year of calm, reflection, and planning, a year of good fortune for the business community to find the key to solving problems. The reputation of the Year of the Snake endures," British Transport Minister Norman Fowler's meaningful words at the discussion meeting expressed the British business community's beautiful expectations for the Year of the Snake.

　　对蛇年的期待
　　——记英国《中国在九十年代》讨论会
　　本报记者　陈特安
    2月3日，伦敦卡菲·罗亚尔饭店宾客盈门。饭店大楼四层会议厅内张灯结彩、座无虚席。主席台上《中国在90年代》的横幅在灯光和鲜花的映衬下格外悦目。中国蛇年春节来临之际，由英国伦敦进出口公司集团和洛弗尔·怀特·达兰特咨询公司举办的盛大迎春讨论会在这里举行。英国政界、工商界知名人士近400人参加了讨论会。英国运输大臣钱农和中国驻英大使冀朝铸分别在讨论会和午宴上讲话。
    会议组织者告诉记者，《中国在90年代》讨论会使所有英国官方、非官方的主要组织聚集一堂，共商发展英中经贸事宜，尚属首次。中国银行伦敦分行经济顾问、英中贸易协会副主席、48家集团副董事长、英中文化协会主任、英中了解协会副主席等7人分别在会上作了系统的长篇发言。英国海外发展部次官在谈到这次讨论会时说，英国公司将从讨论会得到清楚的信息，了解如何在下一个10年去适应中国繁荣发展的需要；同样，中国方面也将通过讨论会更好了解英国对中国有用的技术、产品和服务以及在进入中国市场方面可能遇到的实际困难。
    在过去10年里，英中经济贸易在积极稳步发展，这是讨论会的一个基调。英国是中国在西欧的重要贸易伙伴。英国是西方大国中第一个放松对华禁运的国家，香港问题的圆满解决又为两国经贸关系开拓了新的天地。两国贸易总额1985年比1984年增加了20％，1987年达14.30亿美元。去年1月至10月两国贸易总额已达11.48亿美元。
    发展英中贸易“潜力很大，前景广阔”，则是这次讨论会的主旋律。展望中国蛇年，放眼90年代，讨论会认为两国贸易可望有较大幅度的增长。据英国海外贸易局高级官员说，在中国蛇年，英中贸易额将从占英国外贸总额的1％上升到3％。在英中贸易中起过“破冰者”作用的英国48家集团表示，为配合中国的现代化计划，他们愿为英中贸易额达到50亿美元而努力。据讨论会透露，一个由该集团组织的由150多家大型企业组成的代表团，将由英国前首相希思率领于今年访华，到各大城市进行经济洽谈。英国贸易和工业大臣扬勋爵4月即将第6次访华，旨在推动经贸合作的发展。威尔士王储与戴安娜王妃今年11月也将访华，英国大型出口贸易展览届时将在北京举办。
    去年12月刚访华的英国运输大臣钱农在为讨论会发表的主旨讲话中认为，英中两国经济合作路子宽广，比如在港口建设、公路铁路建设以及交通控制系统等领域内，英国公司都面临巨大的机会。
    “蛇年历来被认为是冷静、沉思和规划之年，是工商界找到解决难题钥匙的吉祥之年，蛇年的这种声誉长驻。”英国运输大臣钱农在讨论会上这番意味深长的话，表达了英国工商界对蛇年美好的期待。
