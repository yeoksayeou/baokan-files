Spring Festival Disappointment

From the numerous errors in written characters, pronunciation, and general knowledge that appear daily in newspapers, television, and radio broadcasts for our domestic and international readers, viewers, and listeners, it is truly intolerable. Every time I meet the veteran publisher Mr. Zeng Xianxiu (Yan Shou), he would list a long series of such errors with a heavy heart. I remember he once wrote an article in the People's Daily suggesting that the editorial department should hire a group of high school language teachers to oversee the language knowledge. I, however, have my doubts: this elder seems to have in mind the image of high school teachers from the past. Nowadays, many scholars who have obtained the titles of associate professor or associate editor often make mistakes in writing characters, pronunciation, and logic in their "application reports" and do not feel ashamed. After all, whether one has knowledge or not, whether one works hard or not, everyone is the same (perhaps even the opposite)! As long as one endures to the end of the year, the title naturally comes. The new "reading is useless" theory is not entirely due to the devaluation of knowledge or the fact that individual entrepreneurs earn more than university professors; what is most disappointing is that within the circle of knowledge, due to various reasons, the scales are often tipped by the will of superiors, making it difficult to find a high school teacher like Xia Kuaizhon (some newspapers in the past wrote it as Xia Kuaizhon). It seems to be a fact: although our era has produced many outstanding elites, and artificial satellites can accurately return to the ground, from the inability of many high school students to write a fluent letter to the proliferation of inferior literary books and periodicals becoming a means for the publishing industry to make money, it is far from just a single leaf falling and the whole world knowing it's autumn! This is of course due to the "ten-year catastrophe" and the long-term "the more knowledge, the more reactionary" that have laid the groundwork, but it is also likely to be the result of the sloppy and unserious work style of the cultural, educational, and publishing departments. In terms of education, the weight of a primary school student's backpack has already reached tens of pounds, filled with various kinds of supplementary materials and classroom assignments that must be purchased along with textbooks... Teachers teach by the book, and even the practice questions do not need to be created, while students bear the burden like oxen, not knowing which one is the real textbook. Educators have long lamented the endless harm, and the education committee has repeatedly ordered, but it is still not stopped, because many places in the education and publishing departments want to make money from this! Published works have been evaluated by readers as "no mistakes, no book," not just because of the carelessness of proofreading. Every day, news media that influence millions of readers, viewers, and listeners do not pay much attention to this, and on the screen, such as writing "deputy manager" as "pay manager," is no longer a problem. Common knowledge errors often occur, and even major newspapers and news agencies often do this. Not long ago, General Tao Zhiyue passed away, and a news report released on the same day said he had once served as the "commander of the Xinjiang Garrison Command," but it should be "Xinjiang Garrison Commander." How did this "commander of the Garrison Command" come about? Recently, I saw a news report in several major newspapers in the capital on February 4, which mentioned that Hou Jianru "served as a platoon leader, company commander, division commander, corps commander, and commander-in-chief in the Nationalist Army." It is well known that there is no such title as "commander-in-chief" in the Nationalist Army. Is it that General Hou had a special military position in the Nationalist Army that was not announced to the outside world, imitating the People's Liberation Army's title of "commander-in-chief"? The above two examples are common knowledge that does not require deep learning, and such carelessness has already made people surprised; what is even more strange is that so many newspapers, big and small, actually published them without correction, and after they were published, there must have been people who noticed, but they never corrected them. If this appeared in a news report from another major news agency in the world...

When I first read Zhu Qifeng's "Dictionary of Homophones," I not only benefited from this magnificent work but also admired his persistent "tenacious struggle" spirit. It was because he was ridiculed by students for not understanding that "first apply both ends" and "first hide both ends" are synonymous while marking papers that he wrote the "Dictionary of Homophones." In comparison, we are often too careless about the various errors in publicly published materials and news media.

The ancestors passed down the saying of "auspicious start to the new year," writing such a short article really makes one disappointed. I hope that in the coming years, writing such articles will become groundless.

　　新春扫兴
    焉之
    从我们每天面向海内外广大读者、观众、听众的报刊、电视、广播里出现的写错字、念错音以及种种常识性错误之多看来，实在让人难以容忍。每次遇到老出版家曾彦修（严秀）同志，他都要不胜感慨地列举一大堆。记得他还在《人民日报》上写过一篇文章，提出了一个聘请一批中学语文教师来为编辑部把把语文常识关的建议。我则对此颇表怀疑：这位长者在脑海中留下的大概还是以前的中学教师的形象。现在好些已取得副教授、副编审以上职称的文士们常常写错字、念错音以及写出文理不通的“申请报告”来而不能自省、自惭的状况已经不足为奇了。反正有没有学问下不下功夫大家都一个样（也许还正相反）！只要熬到年头职称自然到手。新的“读书无用论”倒不是全部因为知识贬值、个体户比大学教授赚线多；最让人疾首的是在知识圈中，由于种种原因，天平的法码多由长官的意志铸成，要找到像夏丐尊（前些年有的报纸曾写成夏丐尊）那样的中学教师已不大可能了。有一点似乎确属事实：尽管我们的时代涌现了众多出类拔萃的精英，人造卫星可以准确地收回地面，但从不少高中学生写不成一封畅达的书简，到种种低劣的文学书刊泛滥而成了书业生财之道，已远非一叶落而天下惊秋！这当然有“十年浩劫”和长期来“知识越多越反动”种下的前因，但恐怕也是文教、新闻、出版部门作风不严谨不认真所带来的后果。从教育来说，小学生的书包已经十几斤重，里面装的多数是必须从课本一道买的各种各样的辅导资料和课堂作业……老师照本宣科，连练习题都不用出，学生如牛负重，不知哪一本是真正的教科书。教育家们早已痛陈其害无穷，教委三令五申却禁而不止，因为不少地方的教育和出版部门要以此赚钱！出版物已经被读者评为“无错不成书”，不仅仅是因为校对不精的缘故。每天影响着千百万读者、观众、听众的新闻媒介对此也并不十分注意，荧光屏上诸如将“副经理”写成“付经理”之类已经不算问题。常识性的舛误时有发生，就连大报和通讯社也常如此。不久前陶峙岳将军逝世，一条当日播发的通稿中说他曾任国民党的“新疆警备总司令部司令”，其实应该是“新疆警备总司令”，不知这“总司令部司令”是怎么来的？顷见本月４日首都几家大报所载的一篇通讯，其中又有一处提到侯镜如“在国民党军队中任排长、连长、师长、军长、司令员等职”。众所周知，国民党军队中从无“司令员”的称谓，莫非侯将军在国民党军队中曾任有一个对外不宣的特殊军职、是仿照中国人民解放军称“司令员”么？以上两例都是不需要高深学问的普通常识，如此轻率已使人感到吃惊；更令人奇怪的是这么多大小报纸居然照登不误，而见报后总不会没人发现，但从来不予更正。假如是出现在世界上别一家大通讯社的新闻稿上呢？……
    少时第一次读朱起凤《辞通》，不仅从这部煌煌大著中受益，更钦佩他那种锲而不舍的“顽强拚搏”精神。他就是因为代教师阅卷不懂“首施两端”与“首鼠两端”同义受到学生奚落而发愤撰《辞通》的。对比起来，我们对公开出版物和新闻媒介中的种种差错是常常太不认真了。
    老祖宗传下来有新春开笔大吉之说，写了这样一则短文，真是让人扫兴。希望在未来的岁月里，写这样的文章会成为无的放矢。
