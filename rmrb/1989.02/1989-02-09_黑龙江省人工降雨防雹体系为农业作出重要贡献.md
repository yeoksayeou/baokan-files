    The Heilongjiang Province has established a system for artificial rain and hail prevention, which has played a significant role in drought relief and hail prevention. According to incomplete statistics, over the past two years, the system has helped farmers reduce losses by nearly 200 million yuan.

    Heilongjiang Province often experiences drought and hailstorms in the summer, which can cause substantial damage to agricultural production. In early 1987, the provincial government established the Office of Artificial Rain. Over the past two years, the office has gradually formed a technical system that includes radar, satellite reception, computer communication, high-altitude and ground-level detection, and short-term forecasting. This system uses advanced technology and equipment to guide artificial rain and hail prevention operations. Last year, the office conducted hail prevention operations in 49 counties, totaling 203 times. As a result, the areas protected by anti-hail guns were not affected by hail damage, reducing losses by more than 60 million yuan, with an effective hail prevention rate of nearly 80%.

    黑龙江省人工降雨防雹体系为农业作出重要贡献　黑龙江省已建立起一套人工降雨防雹体系，在抗旱防雹中发挥了重要作用。据不完全统计，近两年为农民减少损失近２亿元。
    黑龙江省入夏后多发生旱雹天气，往往给农业生产造成较大损失。１９８７年年初，省政府组建了人工降雨办公室。近两年逐步组成了雷达、卫星接收、计算机通讯、高空地面探测和短时预报等技术系统，运用技术设备优势进行降雨防雹作业指导。去年，这个省的人工降雨办公室先后在４９个县进行防雹作业２０３次，使高炮防护区内均未受到冰雹灾害的影响，减少损失６０００多万元，防雹有效率近８０％。
