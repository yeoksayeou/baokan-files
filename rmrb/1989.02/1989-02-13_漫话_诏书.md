In a feudal society centered around imperial power, the form of an "imperial edict" specifically represented the will of the emperor. Whenever an edict (imperial decree) arrived, whether it brought joy or misfortune, the recipient could not help but feel anxious, for a single decree could instantly decide a person's fate. The term "imperial edict" originally referred to commands issued by superiors to subordinates. After the Qin and Han dynasties, it specifically referred to imperial decrees. The "Shiji" (Records of the Grand Historian) records that Li Si once proposed: "Your servants dare to suggest that the title 'Taihuang' be used, and the commands be called 'Zhi,' and the decrees be called 'Zhao.' The emperor himself shall be referred to as 'Zhen.'"

Imperial edicts had several other names. One was "imperial orders," which referred to imperial decrees and proclamations. For example, the "Shiji" (Records of the Grand Historian) states: "Whenever imperial orders and ceremonies were issued, the elderly scholars could not speak, and Jia Yi responded on their behalf." Another was "imperial tablets." The "Hou Han Shu" (Book of the Later Han) records: "(Cao Jie) summoned the officials of the Secretariat, threatened them with weapons, and made them create imperial tablets." Yet another was "imperial scrolls." The "Sanguozhi" (Records of the Three Kingdoms) states: "The imperial scroll addressed to Zhuge Liang said: 'The blame for the Battle of Jieting lies with Ma Su.'" and so on.

The physical form of imperial edicts also marked the progress of ancient material civilization. Before the reign of Emperor Gaozong of the Tang Dynasty, imperial edicts were written on white paper. During the Yuanyan period of Emperor Gaozong, an edict was issued stating that in the past, imperial edicts were written on white paper, which was often eaten by insects and difficult to preserve. From then on, imperial edicts began to be written on yellow paper. In the Song Dynasty, Wang Lu's "Wild Client Miscellany" refers to this type of paper as "yellow hemp paper." The use of yellow paper to copy ancient books in China is recorded to have begun in the Tang Dynasty. Yellow paper was dyed with the plant pigment of the yellow bark tree, which contains small amounts of berberine, berberine, and berberine oil, among other substances, and has strong antibacterial properties. Paper dyed with it has a vibrant color, a unique scent, and can prevent bookworms and fish from damaging books. Therefore, many bound books also often use thick and hard yellow paper for their covers and backs. As for the later use of yellow as the most revered color for dragon robes, banners, and the like, it seems to have some connection with the imperial edicts written on yellow paper.

In a centralized feudal autocratic society, imperial edicts held immense deterrent power. Due to the inevitable power struggles within the feudal ruling class, the use of imperial edicts often varied with time and place. Some upright officials often skillfully utilized imperial edicts to punish corrupt officials and evil landlords. For example, in the Yuan opera "Chen Zhou Selling Rice," Judge Bao anticipated that Liu Korun would bring a pardon, which stated, "Pardon the living, not the dead," so he had Xiao Heigu use a purple gold hammer to kill Yang Jinwu, resulting in Xiao Heigu being pardoned without guilt. In the TV series "Ding Baozhen," Ding Baozhen also used the time difference between two imperial edicts arriving to kill An Dehai at the back door and then go to receive the pardon at the front door. The phenomenon of "imperial edicts hanging on the wall" is another matter. This often refers to local officials holding great power, often disregarding imperial decrees, making them mere formalities. The "Initial Learning" records that during the Eastern Han Dynasty, Cui Shi's "Correct Discourse" stated: "Now, the officials in charge of the prefectures and counties, disregarding imperial edicts, act as they please, entering and exiting at will. Hence, the local saying goes: 'The prefecture and county edicts are like thunder, receiving an edict is just to hang it on the wall.'" This shows a glimpse of the chaotic administration at the end of the Han Dynasty. As for the rumors of "passing the throne to the X son" and the like, they are even more mysterious. Stories such as Yongzheng's alteration of the imperial will can be considered a cultural deposit of the "imperial edict phenomenon."

　　漫话“诏书”
    周旻
    在皇权集中的封建社会中，“诏书”的形式具体地代表了皇帝的意志。大凡诏书（圣旨）一到，或喜或祸，接旨人无不惶恐不安，因为一道诏旨顷刻即可决定一个人的命运。“诏书”原是古时上级给下级的命令文告，秦汉以后，专指帝王的文书命令。《史记·秦始皇纪》记李斯曾议说：“臣等昧死上尊号，王曰‘泰皇’，命为‘制’，令为‘诏’，天子自曰‘朕’。”诏书还有数种叫法，其一曰“诏令”，即诏书诰令。如《史记·贾谊传》：“每诏令仪下，诸老先生不能言，贾生为之对。”其二曰“诏板”。《后汉书·窦武传》：“（曹节）召尚书官属，胁以白刃，使作诏板。”其三曰“诏策”，《三国志·诸葛亮传》：“诏策亮曰：‘街亭之役，咎由马谡’”云云即是。
    诏书的物质形式也标志着古代物质文明的进程。唐高宗以前，诏书用白纸。高宗上元年间曾下诏说，皇帝的诏书过去用白纸写，常被蠹虫咬破而难以保存，以后不要用白纸写诏书了。自此，皇帝的诏书始改用黄纸书写。宋代王楙《野客丛书》“禁用黄”一则称这种纸为“黄麻纸”。我国用黄纸抄写古书，据记载也始于唐。黄纸是用黄柏的植物色素染成的，黄柏的树皮内含有小柏硷、黄柏酮和黄柏内脂等，有较强的杀菌力，用它染成的纸，色泽鲜艳，带有特殊气味，可防书虫蠹鱼毁书，因此很多线装书的封面封底也常用厚而硬的黄纸装帧。至于后来黄色成为龙袍、旗帜等等至尊颜色，与“诏黄”这种黄纸书的诏书似乎也有联系。
    在中央集权的封建专制社会中，诏书有巨大的威慑力。由于封建统治集团内部不可避免地存在着各种势力的明争暗斗，因此诏书的运用也往往因时因地而变。一些主持正义的清官常常巧妙地利用诏书而惩诛贪官恶霸。如元杂剧《陈州粜米》中的包公，预料刘衙内会拿来一纸赦书，其内容是“赦活的，不赦死的”，便叫小?古用紫金槌打死杨金吾，结果小?古被赦无罪；电视剧《丁宝桢》里丁宝桢也利用两份诏书先后到达的时间，后门杀掉安德海，前门才去接赦免旨。而“诏书挂壁”的现象又当别论。这常指地方官实握大权，往往不顾朝廷诏令，使之成为空文。《初学记》记东汉崔实《正论》：“今典州群者，自违诏书，纵意出入，故里语曰：‘州群诏，如霹雳，得诏书，但挂壁。’”可见汉末吏治混乱的一斑。至于“传位×子”等等的遗诏的传闻，就更是充满神秘色彩，诸如雍正篡改遗诏等演义故事，不妨称它作“诏书现象”的一种文化积淀罢。
