In mid-December of last year, I saw farmers from Gaotang Town in Huaxian County coming down from the mountains at the end of the Qinling range, each carrying a small sapling of a young cypress tree on their shoulders.

On the mid-mountain slope, I also discovered some smoldering fire pits. It is currently the dry season for grass and trees on the mountain, making it very easy for fires to break out. Not long ago, a forest fire occurred here, and it took nearly three hours of desperate efforts by the stationed troops to extinguish the blaze, resulting in the destruction of a large area of forest. However, this situation did not seem to garner the attention of the local farmers.

　　秦岭尾梢大片森林被火烧毁
    去年１２月中旬的一天，我看到华县高塘镇农民成群结队从秦岭尾梢一带的山里出来，人人肩上扛着砍下的小柏树幼苗。
    在半山腰，我还发现一些未燃尽的火堆。现在，正是山上草木干枯的季节，很容易引起火灾。前不久，这里就发生过一起森林火灾，经驻军奋力抢救近３个小时才将火扑灭，大片森林被毁。可是，这一情况没有引起当地农民的重视。
