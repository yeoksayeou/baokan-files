In Guizhou, I encountered several Buyi ethnic minority officials. I asked them to share their views on Buyi women. They were happy to do so and spoke at length, as if recounting family history.

Meng Sufen (Buyi, Vice Chairman of the Guizhou Provincial Political Consultative Conference): I am proud to be a Buyi woman. Buyi women have always been known for their diligence and thrift, and for their devotion to caring for the elderly and nurturing the young. They are wise and kind-hearted, skilled in spinning, weaving, embroidery, and batik; they are the ones who stay up the latest and rise the earliest in Buyi villages. Whether as young girls or as married women, they manage everything inside and outside the home.

	Under the towering mountains, there is a narrow terrace field; by the babbling stream, Buyi women from Huangla Township in Anshun County, such as Guo Lanfang, are washing clothes and vegetables. She told me she is 35 years old this year and has been learning embroidery since she was 6. In the 12 years since her marriage, she has never slept late or risen late. She said she gets up before dawn every day, and after getting up, she first fetches water for her grandfather and "Dai Dai" (Buyi language for "grandmother") to wash their faces, then prepares breakfast for her two children to go to school; then she carries water, chops pig feed, herds cows, cleans the pigsty, cooks breakfast, washes clothes. After breakfast, she goes to the fields to weed and fertilize; in the evening, she spins, weaves, and takes care of her grandparents, usually not going to bed until after midnight.

Wu Wenyi (Buyi, Assistant Researcher at the Guizhou Provincial Institute of Nationalities): The phrases "skilled and clever" are not enough to describe and summarize the knowledge and talent of Buyi women. Buyi women have always been rich in creativity and spirit of sacrifice. According to historical records, during the Qing Dynasty's Qianlong era, a Buyi girl named Wang Nianshen from Nanlong Prefecture (now Anlong County) could not bear the heavy taxes imposed by the Qing government, so she stood up and led the Buyi villages and people of various ethnic groups to rebel. At that time, the rebel army was formidable, affecting Yunnan and Guangxi, and shaking the capital. The Qing government hurriedly dispatched troops from several provinces to suppress the rebellion. Wang Nianshen was only 22 years old when she died. This year, a scholarly symposium will be held in Xingyi City, Qianxinan Prefecture to commemorate the 190th anniversary of Wang Nianshen's martyrdom.

Meng Sufen: Besides Wang Nianshen, there was also a Wang Lushi in modern times. She came from our Zhenning Buyi and Miao Autonomous County and was known as the "Double-Barrelled Old Lady." When the Red Army passed through her hometown during the Long March, she opened her family's granary to aid the Red Army. After the Red Army left, she personally led troops to attack the Kuomintang's city of Guanling. She is a legendary figure known throughout our Buyi villages.

	During a meal break, I had a warm conversation with the director of the Women's Federation in Zhenning Buyi and Miao Autonomous County. She proudly said: Buyi women are not only famous in history, but they are also famous today. In April of the previous year, Buyi girl Yu Bangzhen was selected to perform Buyi weaving techniques on site in Tokyo and Osaka, Japan; in April of last year, another Buyi girl, Wu Qin from Shitou Village, went to Guangxi and Beijing to teach batik techniques. They have brought honor to Buyi women.

Meng Sufen: Buyi women have another characteristic: in neighboring villages, they fear being called "stupid big sister," so from a young age, they must master weaving, embroidery, batik, sewing, and other handiwork, and toughen their palms. If a girl moves slowly, has clumsy hands, or poor handiwork, or if her palms and the back of her hands are soft and white, the girls in the same village might look at her sideways, thinking she is unwilling to work hard and cannot plow fields, and of course, she would be looked down upon. In Buyi customs, it is said, "Men do not plant rice seedlings, women do not carry coffins." Buyi women who cannot plant rice seedlings will not find a husband.

Wei Hongxing (Buyi, Deputy Secretary-General of the Party Committee of the State Ethnic Affairs Commission): Heavy physical labor prevents Buyi women from fully developing their intelligence and talents, and also restricts their opportunities and possibilities for education.

	During my visit to Shitou Village in the Pandao Mountain area of Zhenning Buyi and Miao Autonomous County, I learned that out of the more than 600 women in the village, almost none of those over 16 years old had received any education. No wonder even the young Women's Federation director, Wei Yunfen, is illiterate. It is said that in other Buyi villages, it is common for girls to drop out of school.

Wang Lanbo (Buyi, Director of the Women's Federation in Zhenning Buyi and Miao Autonomous County): In April 1987, I conducted a survey in Bengan Village, Leryun Township, Liu Ma District, and found that out of the 12 students in the entire village, all were boys. The reason for this is not only the influence of old ideas but also the unequal distribution of labor.

	Leaving the stone house, there is a stone path, and at the end of the path is an endless field. I saw that the Buyi women who work on it all year round are like the tender leaves in the field, swaying in the wind, both weak and full of vitality. (Accompanied by a photograph)

	Zhenning County in Guizhou Province is known as the "home of batik." The girls here learn batik techniques from a young age.

　　与布依族干部聊天
    本报记者  郭嘉
    在贵州，邂逅几位布依族干部，我请他们就布依妇女问题谈谈自己的看法。他们很是乐意，娓娓道来，如数家珍。
    蒙素芬（布依族，贵州省政协副主席）：我为自己是布依妇女中的一员感到骄傲。我们布依族妇女历来以勤劳、节俭为美德，以孝长抚幼为天职。她们贤慧朴厚，心灵手巧，会纺纱、懂织锦、精刺绣、善蜡染；她们是布依寨中睡得最晚起得最早的人，不论在当姑娘时，还是做了媳妇后，里里外外她们都是一把抓。
    〔壁立的山峰下，是一围褊狭的田坝；潺湲的溪水畔，安顺县黄腊乡布依妇女郭兰芳正在浣衣洗菜。她告诉我今年３５岁了，自６岁始跟母辈学绣花。结婚１２年来，还从来没有早睡晚起过。她说，她每天不等天亮就起床，起来后，先给公公、“代代”（布依语：“婆婆”的意思）打水洗脸，然后烫饭给两个孩子吃了上学；再就是挑水、砍猪草、赶牛、倒猪宅、做早饭、洗衣服。吃了早饭，还得到田间薅草施肥；晚上又要纺纱、织锦、伺候公婆，一般到夜１２点以后才能躺下。〕
    伍文义（布依族，贵州省民族研究所助理研究员）：仅仅用“心灵手巧”几个字眼，还不能形容和概括布依妇女的学识和才华。布依妇女历来是富于创造和牺牲精神的。据史料记载，清朝乾隆年间，南笼府（现安龙县）布依姑娘王娘仙，不堪清政府横征暴敛，挺身而出，率领布依村寨各族人民起义。当时起义大军声势浩大，波及云、桂，威震京师，清政府急忙调集数省部队前去镇压。王娘仙死时，年仅２２岁。今年将在黔西南州兴义市举行纪念王娘仙就义１９０周年学术讨论会。
    蒙素芬：除了王娘仙，近代还有一个王陆氏呢，她就出在我们镇宁布依族苗族自治县，当时被誉为“双枪老太婆”，在红军长征路过她家乡时，她打开自家粮仓接济红军，红军走后，她又亲率部队攻打国民党关岭县城，她是我们布依寨中家喻户晓的传奇人物。
    （吃饭间隙，我和镇宁布依族苗族自治县妇联主任热情交谈起来，她无不自豪地说：布依妇女不光历史上有名，现在也照样出名。前年４月，布依姑娘余邦珍被选送到日本东京、大阪等地现场表演编织布依布技术；去年４月，又有石头寨布依姑娘伍琴到广西、北京等地亲授蜡染工艺。她们为布依妇女争了光。）
    蒙素芬：布依妇女还有这么个特点：在邻里村寨，唯恐别人叫她“傻大姐”，因此她们从小就得把织、绣、刺、染、缝等手上活计学到家，把手掌的茧磨厚。如果一个姑娘动作缓、手脚慢、女工次，或者看她手掌手背细嫩白肉的，同寨姑娘就可能斜眼看她，认为她不愿下水，不会刨田，当然也就被人瞧不起。在布依族流传“男子不插秧，女子不抬丧”的时俗。不会插秧的布依妇女是找不到婆家的。
    韦洪兴（布依族，国家民委直属机关党委常务副书记）：繁重的体力劳动，使布依妇女的聪明才智得不到充分发挥，同时也制约了她们受教育的机会和可能。
    （在镇宁布依族苗族自治县扁担山区石头寨村，我走访时得知，全村６００多名妇女，１６岁以上几乎未上过学，难怪连年轻的妇联主任韦云芬也是文盲。据说在其它布依村寨，女孩子中途辍学现象比较普遍。）
    王兰柏（布依族，镇宁布依族苗族自治县妇联主任）：１９８７年４月，我到六马区乐运乡本干村调查，发现全村仅有的１２个在校生，全部是男孩。究其原因，固然有旧的思想观念影响，但主要是劳动量分配上的不平均。
    （走出石寨人家，是一条石路，路的尽头，便是无垠的田原。我看到，常年在上面劳作的布依妇女，好似田野里随风颤动的嫩叶，既孱弱，又呈现出生机……）（附图片）
    贵州省镇宁自治县石头寨是“蜡染之乡”，这里的姑娘们从小就学会蜡染技艺。　　　　罗林春摄
