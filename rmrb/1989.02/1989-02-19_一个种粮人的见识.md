A Grain Farmer's Insights

Reporter Liang Zhaoming

Zhu Canbiao is a well-known large-scale farmer in the Pearl River Delta. It is said that he has leased nearly 100 mu of land, and the grain he produces in a year is enough to feed 200 to 300 people for a year. The reporter recently passed by Zhu Canbiao's "headquarters" in Xigao Village, Zhangjiabian Town, Zhongshan City, Guangdong, and went to visit him out of admiration.

The large-scale farmer in my imagination was a burly man, but the 50-year-old Zhu Canbiao in front of me was of medium height, thin, barefoot, and wearing an old blue cotton jacket.

Old Zhu warmly invited the reporter into his house. Looking around, the house was quite modest, with an old wooden table and a black-and-white television set.

"There used to be a pigsty here," Old Zhu seemed to notice the reporter's curiosity and laughed heartily.

It was the autumn of 1984 after the harvest. Zhu Canbiao leased land with a row of pigsties, which was the place to "set up camp." So he took out all his savings of 5,000 yuan, bought the pigsties, and turned them into a residence and granary, and also built a threshing ground.

Standing on the threshing ground and looking around, almost all the fields were cultivated by Old Zhu, which was quite impressive. He pointed to the green rice seedlings in the paddy fields and said humorously, "I like to wear this old quilted jacket."

What "old quilted jacket"? It turns out that many people in the Pearl River Delta liken growing rice to "wearing an old quilted jacket." Because growing grain does not make a lot of money.

Zhu Canbiao's views are indeed different from others: within the scope of the policy, he leased as much land as possible, invested as little labor as possible, and focused on scientific farming to ensure stable and high grain yields. As a result, he also became rich.

Growing rice requires a lot of labor and is hard work. How can one reduce labor input? Old Zhu believes the solution is mechanization. He had no money, so he sought the support and help of municipal and township leaders and borrowed 230,000 yuan in the first two years to purchase more than 10 types of agricultural machinery.

Old Zhu had agricultural machinery, and he worked efficiently. Starting in 1985, he began working in the paddy fields, and harvesting rice was like getting a haircut. In a few days, nearly 100 mu of rice was harvested cleanly, which immediately became a novelty in the rice-growing area.

"That's the power of the combined harvester. The economic benefits of mechanization are indeed significant," Zhu Canbiao said, flipping through the family account book: "Using the combined harvester to harvest, the total cost per mu is less than 3 yuan. With two crops a year and 90 mu calculated, just saving labor costs is nearly 4,000 yuan, and it can also save time to do other work, which brings in another income."

On the land leased by Zhu Canbiao, plowing and harrowing, harvesting in the fields, all rely on "iron oxen." Drainage and irrigation, pest control and fertilization, weeding, and even rice cleaning are all done by machines. Therefore, even during the busy farming season, not many people are needed in this vast farmland. Busy as it is, it's mainly Old Zhu and his family.

What is said to be a family is actually Old Zhu and his wife. His daughter is still in school, and his three sons, after the busy farming season, "go their separate ways," some doing transportation, others doing construction. The whole year, only he and his wife stay to guard the fields.

Zhu Canbiao's farming methods are also quite different from others: while others rely on chemical fertilizers to increase yield, Old Zhu relies on farmyard manure, which he calls "farming with the land."

Others rely on chemical fertilizers for farming, and the land becomes more and more compacted. But Old Zhu's farmyard manure turns barren land into fertile land in two years. The soil is fertile, and the amount of urea applied has been reduced from the previous 20 kilograms per mu to 7.5 kilograms. Coupled with the use of high-quality rice seeds, the average yield per mu of rice has increased from the original 600 kilograms to more than 710 kilograms. The total grain production has been stable at around 63,000 kilograms for many years, and more than 50,000 kilograms of grain are sold to the state each year, which is more than the total amount of a production brigade (natural village) in the past.

Zhu Canbiao implements mechanization and scientific farming together, not only increasing grain production but also reducing production costs. Last year, the total agricultural income exceeded 40,000 yuan, and the net income was more than 20,000 yuan, most of which came from grain income. Today, Zhu Canbiao has paid off all his loans, and the agricultural machinery purchased with loans at that time has all become his family property.

Zhu Canbiao gradually became famous. With this real example, who can still belittle growing grain as "wearing an old quilted jacket"?

　　一个种粮人的见识
    本报记者  梁兆明
    朱灿标是珠江三角洲有名的大耕家。传闻他承包土地近百亩，一年生产的粮食，足够两三百人一年的口粮。记者近日路经朱灿标的“大本营”广东中山市张家边镇西桠村，慕名前往拜访。
    想象中的大耕家，是个彪形大汉，可是眼前５０开外年纪的朱灿标，中等个子，瘦削身材，光着脚板，穿着一身蓝布旧唐装。
    老朱热情地把记者邀到房舍里。举目四顾，房子简陋得很，一张破旧木桌子放着一台黑白电视机。富户的“气派”一点也没有。
    “这里原来是生产队的猪舍。”老朱似乎觉察到了记者的好奇心，笑哈哈地说。
    那是１９８４年秋收后，朱灿标承包的土地上立着一排猪舍，这正是“安营扎寨”的地方。于是他拿出所有积蓄５０００元，把猪舍买下来，改造成为住房和粮仓，又配套建了晒谷场。
    站在晒谷场上环顾四野，田地几乎都是老朱耕种的，很有大耕家的气魄。他指着稻田里的青青禾苗，风趣地说：“我爱穿这件破棉袄。”
    什么“破棉袄”？原来，珠江三角洲不少人把种水稻比喻为“穿破棉袄”。因为种粮食不赚大钱。
    朱灿标的见解确实与众不同：在政策许可范围内，他承包了尽可能多的土地，投入了尽可能少的人力，重点在科学种田上下功夫，确保粮食稳产高产，结果，一样致富。
    种水稻花工大，又辛苦，怎样才能少投入人力呢？老朱认为出路是搞农业机械化。他手头没有钱，就争取市、镇领导的支持和帮助，头两年贷款２．３万元，购置了１０多种农业机械。
    老朱有了农机，干活得心应手。１９８５年开始下水田，收刈水稻如同剃头，三两天就把近１００亩水稻收刈得干干净净，这在水稻区顿时成为新鲜事。
    “那是联合收刈机的力量，机械化的经济效益确实可观。”朱灿标翻开家庭帐本说：“使用联合收割机刈禾，每亩总成本不到３元。按一年两造，９０亩计算，仅节省工费就将近４０００元，还能省下时间干别的活，又有一笔收益。”
    在朱灿标承包的土地上，犁田耙地、下田刈禾，全靠“铁牛”，排水灌溉，杀虫追肥，中耕除草，以至稻谷除杂，都靠机器。所以，在这大片农田上，就是农忙季节也用不着多少人。忙来忙去主要是老朱一家子。
    说是一家子，实际是老朱和他的老伴俩人。他的小女儿还在学校念书，３个儿子在农忙过后就“各奔前程”，有的外出搞运输，有的外出搞建筑。一年到头留守大田的，只有他和老伴。
    朱灿标种田还有许多与众不同之处：别人种粮食，主要靠化肥提高单产，而老朱靠的是农家肥，他称之为“以田养田”。
    别人靠化肥种田，土地越来越板结。而老朱的农家肥，两年功夫就把瘦田变成肥田，土壤肥沃，尿素施放量从过去每亩２０公斤减少到７．５公斤，加上他使用了水稻良种，水稻平均亩产从原来的６００公斤提高到７１０多公斤。连年粮食总产稳定在６．３万公斤左右，每年向国家出售粮食超过５万公斤，比过去１个生产队（自然村）的总量还多。
    朱灿标实行农业机械化与科学种田并举，不但提高了粮食产量，而且降低了生产成本，去年农业总收入超过４万元，纯收入逾２万元，其中大部分是种粮收益。今天，朱灿标已经还清了全部贷款，当年贷款购置的农业机械，全部成了自家财产。
    朱灿标渐渐闻名一方。有此真人实例，谁还能把种粮食贬低为“穿破棉袄”？
