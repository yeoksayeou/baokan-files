On May 9 of last year, the second page of this newspaper published an article titled "Hunan Road Department Ignores National Regulations, Misuses Road Maintenance Funds of Over 40 Million Yuan," which reported that this department "used road maintenance funds to send children who did not meet admission standards to school." Based on the reporter's information, the Secretary of the Hunan Provincial Party Committee, Xiong Qingquan, instructed the Provincial Supervision Bureau to conduct an investigation.

Recently, the Hunan Provincial Supervision Bureau has determined that Tang Yongxing's daughter, Tang, was a high school graduate in 1985 with a college entrance exam score of 417 points, which did not reach the national admission score line or the national admission plan for commissioned training, but reached the 400-point admission line for adult night school set by the Provincial Education Commission, and was admitted to Changsha Traffic College as a night school student. According to national regulations, night school students pay all tuition fees themselves. Tang Yongxing, as the deputy director of the Provincial Traffic Bureau in charge of engineering and road maintenance funds, went beyond his authority and signed "agree with the bureau's opinion" on a report from the Provincial Road Bureau requesting to lower the admission score line for commissioned training to 400 points and above. This included his own daughter among the 13 students who did not meet the admission score line as commissioned training students within the plan, paying for their education with public funds. His daughter Tang's 10,000 yuan tuition was paid 90% by the Road Bureau using road maintenance funds, with Tang Yongxing himself only paying 1,000 yuan.

The Hunan Provincial Supervision Bureau initially proposed in the "Report on the Handling Opinions Regarding the Issue of Deputy Director Tang Yongxing of the Provincial Traffic Bureau Using Public Funds to Send His Daughter to College" that Tang Yongxing should make a deep self-criticism. Tang and the other 13 students should be converted to self-funded students according to the regulations of the Hunan Provincial Discipline Commission, and pay their own tuition fees. However, for unknown reasons, the Provincial Supervision Bureau changed the handling opinion in the "Notice on the Handling of the Issue of Comrade Tang Yongxing Using Public Funds to Send His Daughter to College" sent to the Hunan Provincial Traffic Bureau to "pay an additional 10% of the tuition fee," meaning that 80% of the 10,000 yuan tuition fee is still paid with road maintenance funds.

After this handling opinion from the Supervision Bureau was made public, some cadres and masses in the Hunan Provincial Traffic Bureau said, "The Party Central Committee has repeatedly emphasized that those who seek private gain through power should not benefit. Tang Yongxing violated regulations and used 9,000 yuan of road maintenance funds to send his daughter to school, only paying an additional 1,000 yuan. How can this educate the person involved and serve as a deterrent to others? Does this conform to the spirit of strict governance of the Party and strict governance of the government?"

　　倚仗职权　挪公款送女上学  处理走样　唐永兴便宜照占
    去年５月９日，本报二版刊登《湖南公路部门无视国家规定，违纪使用养路费４０００多万元》一文，报道这个部门“用养路费送不合录取规定的子女上学”。根据记者的反映，中共湖南省委书记熊清泉指示省监察厅进行了调查。
    最近，湖南省监察厅已查明，唐永兴之女唐某是１９８５年高中毕业生，高考成绩４１７分，没有达到国家统招录取分数线和统招计划委托培养分数线，但达到了省教委规定的４００分的成人夜大录取线，被长沙交通学院录取为夜大生。按国家规定，夜大生学费全部自费。唐永兴为使自己的女儿成为委培生，身为交通厅分管工程和养路费的副厅长，竟超越权限在省公路局一份要求委培录取分数线降为４００分以上的报告上签了“同意路局意见”的意见，同意包括自己女儿在内的１３名未达到录取分数线的考生作为公费上学的计划内委培生。女儿唐某的１万元学费，由公路局用养路费支付９０％，自己仅出１０００元。
    湖南省监察厅开始在《关于省交通厅副厅长唐永兴用公费送女儿上大学问题处理意见报告》中提出的处理意见是：唐永兴应作出深刻检查。唐某等１３名学生应按湖南省纪委文件规定，应转为自费生，学费自付。但不知什么原因，省监察厅在给湖南省交通厅的《关于唐永兴同志用公费送女儿上大学的处理通知》中，关于学费问题却改为“增交学费１０％”，即１万元学费中仍用养路费支付８０％。
    监察厅的这一处理意见传出后，湖南省交通厅的一些干部和群众说，党中央一再强调不能让以权谋私者占便宜。唐永兴违反规定，用９０００元养路费送女儿读书，只补交１０００元，这怎么能教育本人，以儆效尤？这符合从严治党和从严治政的精神吗？　　本报记者　吴兴华
