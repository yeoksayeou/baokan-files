The draft of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, submitted to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for deliberation, although still has some imperfections and needs further revision, is generally a good draft, reflecting the spirit of the "Sino-British Joint Declaration" and conforming to the basic policy of the Chinese government for the future Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.

He believes that, looking back at the drafting process over the past three years, it has been generally healthy and normal. The heated debates and discussions in Hong Kong are a good phenomenon, not a bad one. It shows active participation rather than passive rejection.

Nevertheless, Xu Jiadun still thinks that in Hong Kong society, in the drafting of the Basic Law, it is still necessary to emphasize democracy, coordination, harmony, and progress. When there are different opinions, it is best to use dialogue and discussion, with all parties fully presenting their arguments, and with a spirit of mutual understanding and compromise. Seek common ground while reserving differences, and sometimes even seek common ground while reserving major differences, starting from the overall situation, from the interests of national unity, and from the overall interests of Hong Kong, to strive for relatively consistent opinions, so that Hong Kong society can develop stably and smoothly draft a perfect Basic Law.

He suggests that after this meeting's deliberation, the draft of the Basic Law can be further consulted in a democratic, open, and comprehensive manner.

　　香港基本法草案总体较好
    许家屯建议人大审议后再作咨询
    新华社北京２月２０日电  全国人大常委会委员许家屯今天在七届全国人大常委会第六次会议全体会上说，提交人大常委会审议的香港特别行政区基本法草案，尽管还有不完善之处，还需要进一步修改，但从总体上讲，是一部比较好的草稿，体现了“中英联合声明”的精神，符合我国政府对香港未来特别行政区的基本方针。
    他认为，综观这三年多的起草过程，总的来说是健康的，正常的。在香港引起热烈争论和讨论是好现象，不是坏现象。是积极投入而不是消极排斥的表现。
    尽管如此，许家屯仍然认为，在香港社会，在基本法起草当中，还是要强调民主、协调、和谐、进步。在有不同意见的时候，尽量采用对话的方式，讨论的方式，各方充分说理，而且要有互谅互让的精神，求大同、存小异，甚至有时是求大同，存大异，从大局出发，从国家统一的利益出发，从香港的整体利益出发，尽量取得较为一致的意见，以便香港社会稳定发展，顺利地起草一部完善的基本法。
    他建议，经过这次会议审议后，能够对基本法草案再进行一次民主、开放和全面的咨询。
