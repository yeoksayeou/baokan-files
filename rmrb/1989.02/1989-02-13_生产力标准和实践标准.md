Title: The Standards of Productive Forces and Practice

After the discussion on the standard of practice, everyone is eager to build our socialism well, and this is a consensus. However, in the process of reform, people's views on many specific measures are not entirely consistent, and the issue of whether something is "socialist" or "capitalist" often arises. Why is this the case? If we set aside other reasons, one important reason is that people have different standards for judging whether socialism is built "well." Can the standard of practice solve this problem? It is not very likely. Let's take a familiar example: the ten years of turmoil brought the national economy to the brink of collapse, which is a fact proven by practice. However, at that time, there was a set of established criteria for what constituted building socialism well, which was to see whether the "proletariat" had implemented "complete dictatorship" over the "bourgeoisie," whether the prevention of capitalist restoration was effective, and so on. As for whether productive forces were improved, whether science and culture were advanced, and whether people's lives were improved, these were not considered. According to this standard, behaviors that brought disaster to the country under the banner of "revolution" were of course extremely reasonable, and even if the national economy was on the brink of collapse, it was still a great victory for the socialist cause. If you say, "Practice has proven that if we continue this way, China will become poorer and the people will suffer more, how can this be considered building socialism well?" Someone might retort, "The poorer, the more revolutionary; the more suffering, the stronger. Practice has proven that we have prevented capitalist restoration, which means we have built socialism well!" What can you do? There is no way! Different value systems mean that you can't reach an agreement.

This is an extreme example. Of course, no one now insists on such a value system. However, do similar problems still exist? They do. This is not surprising. Although we have criticized the absurd and reactionary socialist views of the Gang of Four, we have not thoroughly cleaned up the fixed socialist model that has taken shape over the years. At that time, socialism was attached to some unscientific things, forming an evaluation system, as if only by meeting the various indicators of this evaluation system could socialism be considered successful, otherwise, it would be deviating from the socialist direction. Many comrades hope for rapid development of productive forces and improvement of people's lives and are genuinely happy to see the effectiveness of many reform measures. Once they use the familiar evaluation system to measure, they feel it doesn't look like "socialism," and thus doubts arise, and they hesitate to move forward. The solution to this problem is to promote the Marxist value system and make as many people as possible accept the standard of productive forces. The contradiction in practical life is thus pushing us from the discussion of the standard of practice to the discussion of the standard of productive forces. One important contribution of the Thirteenth Party Congress is that it clearly puts forward whether it is beneficial to the development of productive forces as the starting point and fundamental criterion for considering all problems and evaluating all work. This is a further concretization and deepening of the view of the standard of practice in socialist construction and reform.

　　生产力标准和实践标准
    陶德麟
    实践标准讨论之后，大家都渴望把我们的社会主义建设好，这是一致的。但是在改革的进程中，人们对许多具体措施的看法也并不那么一致，姓“社”姓“资”的问题不时由此提出来。为什么会这样呢？如果撇开其他原因不论，一个重要的原因就是人们对衡量社会主义是否建设得“好”的标准不一致。靠实践标准能不能解决这个问题呢？不大可能。举一个大家熟悉的例子：十年动乱使国民经济濒于崩溃，这是实践证明了的事实。可是当时对什么叫做把社会主义建设好了是有一套既定的衡量标准的，那就是看“无产阶级”是否对“资产阶级”实行了“全面专政”，“防止资本主义复辟”是否卓有成效，等等。至于生产力是否提高，科学文化是否发达，人民生活是否改善，是不在考虑之列的。按照这种标准，在“革命”旗号下祸国殃民的行为当然是极其合理的行为，即使国民经济濒于崩溃也还是社会主义事业取得了伟大胜利。如果你说：“实践证明了这样干下去中国会越来越穷，人民会越来越苦，这怎么能算社会主义建设好了？”有人就会反驳你说：“越穷越革命，越苦越坚强，实践已经证明我们防止了资本主义复辟，也就是表明我们的社会主义搞好了！”请问你有什么办法？毫无办法！价值观不同，是说不到一块去的。
    我这是极而言之。现在当然没有人再坚持这样的价值观了。但是类似的问题是否存在呢？还是存在的。这也毫不足奇。我们虽然批判了林彪、“四人帮”的荒谬反动的社会主义观，但是，过去我们自己对于多年来形成的一套固定的社会主义模式长期没有很好清理。那时给社会主义附加了一些不科学的东西，构成了一个评价系统，似乎只有满足了这个评价系统的各项指标才算把社会主义搞好了，否则就是偏离了社会主义的大方向。许多同志渴望生产力迅速发展，人民生活普遍改善，看到许多改革措施的成效也由衷高兴，一旦用习惯了的评价系统一衡量，就觉得不像“社会主义”，于是疑窦丛生，畏缩不前了。解决这个问题的办法就是宣传马克思主义的价值观，使尽可能多的人接受生产力标准。实际生活的矛盾运动就是这样把我们由实践标准的讨论推向生产力标准的讨论的。党的十三大的一个重要贡献，就是明确地把是否有利于生产力的发展，作为我们考虑一切问题的出发点和检验一切工作的根本标准。这是实践标准的观点在社会主义建设和改革中的进一步具体化和深化。
