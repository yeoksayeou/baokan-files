Edition: 6

In 1988, our agency approved the arrest of 65 juvenile offenders, of which 29 were charged with robbery. Compared to the same period last year, juvenile robbers increased by 107%. The youngest among them was only 14 years old. Their methods of committing crimes vary; some act alone, some form groups, and some collaborate with adults. Their methods are also brutal; some wear masks during robberies, and some use weapons. Most of them commit crimes during the day. Some criminals commit multiple crimes in a short period; one offender committed 7 robberies in less than a month. Their primary targets are often middle and elementary school students. For example, a 15-year-old boy named Zhang Hongjie, either alone or with others, committed 7 robberies, stealing 7 watches and some cash.

The increase in juvenile robbers should be a concern for society. We hope that relevant departments and parents will strengthen the education and management of out-of-school, unemployed, and rural minors.

　　重庆沙坪坝区少年抢劫犯增多
    １９８８年，我院共批准逮捕６５名少年人犯，其中犯抢劫罪的２９人。与上一年同期相比，少年抢劫犯增加１０７％。他们中年龄最小的仅１４岁。他们的作案方式各异，有的单独行动；有的互相结伙；有的与成年人合伙。他们的作案手段也较凶狠，有的蒙面抢劫；有的持械行凶，他们多数是在白天作案。有的罪犯在不到一个月的时间里，便作案７次。他们的抢劫对象多为中小学生。如１５岁的少年张洪杰，先后单独或伙同他人抢劫７次，共抢劫７块手表及一些现金。
    少年抢劫犯增多的情况，望能引起社会的重视，希望有关部门及家长们对失学、待业及农村的未成年人要加强教育管理。
