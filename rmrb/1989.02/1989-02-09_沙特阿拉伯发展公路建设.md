The third conference of the International Road Federation of the Middle East was held last year in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia. Famous road experts from around the world were invited to attend this meeting. The attendees highly praised the Saudi government's efforts in developing road construction and unanimously commended Saudi Arabia for building the longest and best road network in the Middle East.

Saudi Arabia is vast in territory and strategically important. It has the world-renowned Rub' al Khali Desert, the largest underground oil reserves on Earth, and the holy sites of Islam that Muslims worldwide aspire to visit. Additionally, it is a crucial trade route connecting Europe, Asia, and Africa. For a long time, the Saudi government has planned to build a comprehensive road network to transport underground oil, accelerate national construction, and provide convenience for Muslims coming to pilgrimage. However, due to a lack of funds, this project could not be implemented.

The large-scale production of oil brought blessings to Saudi Arabia, especially the significant increase in oil prices in the 1970s, which rapidly enriched the formerly impoverished Saudi Arabia. The Saudi government decided to use its substantial petrodollars for construction, with the primary task being to build a nationwide road network.

After nearly 20 years of unremitting efforts, Saudi Arabia has achieved significant results in road construction. Its road construction has the following characteristics: (1) Fast speed. From 1970 to 1987, Saudi Arabia built over 100,000 kilometers of various roads. Such a road-building speed is rare in the world. (2) Large investment. By the end of 1987, the Saudi government had allocated over $30 billion for road construction, an astonishing amount. (3) High quality. Saudi Arabia's roads are of world-class standards. For example, the high-speed road from Mecca to Jeddah is only 60 kilometers long but cost $1.2 billion, averaging $20 million per kilometer. This road plays an important role in transporting pilgrims. (4) High difficulty. Many roads pass through deserts and mountains, making construction challenging. For instance, the West Arar Road has 63 kilometers passing through rugged mountains. The road construction team built 32 bridges, averaging almost one bridge per half kilometer, with each bridge averaging 65 meters in height. There are also 11 mountain tunnels and 351 drainage culverts. (5) Comprehensive facilities. This comprehensive road network includes highways, rural roads, main roads, branch roads, dual-lane roads, and single-lane roads. In the holy city of Mecca, the municipal government allocated $1 billion to build inner, middle, and outer ring roads and numerous overpasses, significantly alleviating traffic congestion during the pilgrimage peak.

While developing road construction, Saudi Arabia has also cultivated a large number of professional talents. The Saudi government sends a batch of students to Europe and America each year to study road construction technology. Currently, a considerable number of Saudi engineers and experts are active in the road construction sector. In 1963, there were only 5 Saudi road construction companies nationwide. By the end of 1987, there were over 100 such companies.

According to the Saudi government's plan, by 1990, the country will build another 2,000 kilometers of main roads, 3,300 kilometers of branch roads, and 33,800 kilometers of rural roads. Additionally, 8,100 kilometers of rural roads will be paved with asphalt. Saudi Arabia's road network continues to expand and extend to various parts of the country.

### 沙特阿拉伯发展公路建设

　　沙特阿拉伯发展公路建设
　　时延春
    中东地区国际公路联合会第三次大会去年在沙特阿拉伯首都利雅得召开，世界上著名的公路专家应邀出席了这次会议。与会者高度赞扬沙特政府为发展公路建设所做出的努力，齐口称赞沙特阿拉伯修建了中东地区最长和最好的公路网。
    沙特阿拉伯幅员辽阔，地理位置重要。它既有举世闻名的鲁卜·哈利大沙漠，又有地球上最大的地下油海，还有全世界穆斯林所向往的伊斯兰教圣地。同时，它还是连结欧、亚、非三大洲的通商要道。长期以来，沙特政府一直计划修建一个四通八达的公路网，把地下的石油采出来，运出去，加快国家建设，也为世界上的穆斯林前来朝觐提供方便。但由于缺乏资金，这项工作迟迟不能落实。
    石油的大量生产给沙特阿拉伯带来福音，尤其70年代石油大幅度提价，使昔日贫困的沙特阿拉伯迅速富裕起来。沙特政府决定利用手中的巨额石油美元从事建设，而首要任务是先修建一个横贯全国的公路网。
    经过近20年的不懈努力，沙特阿拉伯在公路建设方面取得了巨大成就。它的公路建设具有以下特点：（一）速度快。自1970年至1987年，沙特阿拉伯共修建各类公路10万多公里，这样的筑路速度在世界上是不多见的。（二）投资大。截至1987年底，沙特政府为筑路拨款达300多亿美元，拨款之巨也是惊人的。（三）质量高。沙特阿拉伯的公路具有世界一流水平。如，麦加至吉达的高速公路全线长仅60公里，但耗资却达12亿美元，平均每公里耗资200万美元。这条公路为输送朝觐者起了重要作用。（四）难度大。很多公路穿过沙漠和高山，施工难度大。如，西阿尔公路有63公里穿过崎岖的山区，筑路队共架起32座桥，平均不到半公里便架一座桥，每座桥平均高度为65米，另有11个穿山隧道和351个排水涵洞。（五）配套全。这个四通八达的公路网既有高速公路，也有农村公路；既有干线，也有支线；既有双行线，也有单行线。在宗教圣地麦加城，市政当局拨款1亿美元，修建了内环路、中环路和外环路，还修建了许多立交桥，大大减缓了朝觐高峰期出现的交通拥挤现象。
    沙特阿拉伯在发展公路建设的同时，也培养了大批专业人才。沙特政府每年都派一批留学生到欧、美等国学习筑路技术。目前，有相当数量的沙特工程师和专家活跃在筑路战线上。1963年，全国仅有5家沙特公路承包公司，到1987年底，已有100多家这样的公司。
    根据沙特政府的规划，到1990年，全国将再建成2000公里公路干线，3300公里支线，修建农村公路共33800公里，并将8100公里农村公路铺上沥青路面。沙特阿拉伯的公路网正继续向全国各地扩展和延伸。
