Beijing's ancient Bell Tower has reopened to the public after several years of restoration, as of February 1.

The Bell Tower and Drum Tower are a set of ancient buildings constructed during the Yuan Dynasty. They are located at the northern end of Beijing's central north-south axis. The two towers are majestic and imposing, serving as the timekeeping centers for the capitals of the Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties. The bronze bell placed on the Bell Tower was cast during the Ming Dynasty's Yongle era. The bell is 5.4 meters high, 3.4 meters in diameter, 0.27 meters thick, and weighs approximately 42 tons.

The entire bell is made of resonant bronze. When struck, it produces a deep, resonant, and mellow sound that can be heard up to 40 li away with the wind.
