The research project "Development of Scomberomorus niphonius Resources," led by the Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences Yellow Sea Fisheries Research Institute and participated by relevant production units, has made significant progress over the past three years using advanced methods from the 1980s, such as the "Beidou" marine fishing survey ship and echo integration equipment.

According to investigations and expert evaluations, the Scomberomorus niphonius resources in the Yellow Sea are abundant, with reserves exceeding 280 million tons. The annual catchable amount is approximately 50 million tons. The wintering grounds, migration patterns, and distribution range of Scomberomorus niphonius have been basically identified. In two voyages from 1988 to early 1989, the "Beidou" ship tested the catch of Scomberomorus niphonius, with the highest net yield reaching 60 tons and an average hourly yield of 5.2 tons, indicating a promising production and development prospect. Experts believe that the natural mortality rate of Scomberomorus niphonius in the fishing grounds is as high as 40%. If these resources are not developed and utilized, they will be wasted in the sea. Therefore, experts urge the need to develop and utilize Scomberomorus niphonius resources as soon as possible.

Scomberomorus niphonius is a pelagic fish that is an excellent raw material for fish meal production and can also be used for food. In recent years and for a considerable period in the future, China's aquaculture industry will continue to grow at a relatively high speed. Animal protein sources, especially fish meal, are in short supply. The country has had to use a large amount of foreign exchange to import fish meal. Between October 1987 and 1988, China imported 570,000 tons of fish meal, spending $270 million in foreign exchange. If 50 million tons of Scomberomorus niphonius are developed and caught, at least 10 million tons of fish meal can be produced, saving the country $50 million in foreign exchange annually. Accelerating the development of Scomberomorus niphonius resources is both a short-term need and a long-term benefit.

　　鳀鱼资源急待开发
    本报讯  以中国水产科学院黄海水产研究所牵头，有关生产单位参加的国家“七五”重点科研攻关项目“鳀鱼资源开发”的研究，３年来采用８０年代先进的“北斗号”海洋渔业调查船及回声积分仪等现代方法，已取得重大进展。
    经调查和专家评估，黄东海区鳀鱼资源丰富，蕴藏量在２８０万吨以上，年可捕量约５０万吨，并已基本探明冬季越冬鳀鱼的密集渔场，回游规律和分布范围。１９８８年至１９８９年初两个航次，“北斗号”试捕鳀鱼最高网产达６０吨，平均单位小时产量５．２吨，显示出具有生产性开发前景。专家们认为，渔场中鳀鱼年自然死亡率高达４０％，若不开发利用，这些资源将白白“浪费”于海中。为此，专家们呼吁要尽快开发利用鳀鱼资源。
    鳀鱼是外海中上层鱼类，是制造鱼粉的优质原料，也可供食用。近几年，以至今后较长时期，由于我国水产养殖业仍将以较高的速度持续增长，动物蛋白源，特别是鱼粉供不应求，国家不得不用大量外汇进口鱼粉。仅１９８７—１９８８年１０月间，我国就进口鱼粉５７万余吨，支付外汇２．７亿美元。若开发捕捞５０万吨鳀鱼，至少可生产１０万吨鱼粉，每年可为国家节省外汇５０００万美元。加快开发鳀鱼资源，既是近期需要，又具长远利益。
