The highly watched "North case" was originally scheduled to go to trial on January 31. Due to disagreements over the disclosure of White House secret materials between the U.S. Department of Justice, the Federal Special Court, and the prosecutor, the trial was delayed for two weeks.

In this trial, Oliver North, a key figure in the "Iran-Contra affair" and former White House National Security Council official, faces 12 charges, primarily obstruction of justice, providing false testimony to Congress, unauthorized alteration, transfer, and destruction of government documents, etc. Two key charges involving the alleged diversion of profits from arms sales to Iran to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels were dropped at the beginning of the year due to alleged "national security" issues. However, the Department of Justice discovered that North would still disclose some materials that endangered national security, and on February 8, it intervened in the case, requesting that Judge Gesell order North to stop leaking information. Gesell rejected the Department of Justice's request, stating that not allowing the defendant to present evidence was not a fair trial but a "farce," and clearly stated that the trial would begin the next morning after the jury was sworn in.

Subsequently, Attorney General Thornburgh filed two appeals with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, requesting a stay of the trial, but both were dismissed. Prosecutor Walsh publicly accused Thornburgh of attempting to "undermine his independence," criticizing his appeal statements as "untrue," "inaccurate," and "incomprehensible," and believing that the intelligence community had exaggerated the danger of exposing secret materials during the trial. At this point, the trial issue became deadlocked.

Thornburgh, with no choice, appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. On the 12th, Chief Justice Rehnquist approved the Department of Justice's request to suspend the trial. That day, the Department of Justice and the prosecutor reached a compromise on how to protect government secrets and submitted the agreement to Gesell. The agreement stipulated that the prosecutor and the Attorney General would jointly propose restrictions on the use of controversial secret materials during the trial and allow the Attorney General to exercise the powers granted by the "Classified Information Procedures Act" to intervene in the trial at any time if necessary.

Gesell stated the next day that he would not allow the Attorney General to use a certificate prohibiting the disclosure of personal secret files to suspend the trial unless he requested the dismissal of all charges against North or any of the 12 charges; only the prosecutor had the right to submit such a certificate. He said that the court had the responsibility to protect the defendant in criminal cases according to the Constitution, and every citizen had the right to present a fair and sufficient defense in the trial, which meant that political factors could not be introduced into criminal trials. If fair defense could not be achieved, he would stop the trial.

The reaction of North's defense lawyers was even more intense. They accused the new prosecution plan of actually guaranteeing the Attorney General's "key role" in the trial, making North face two decision-making authorities instead of "the sole prosecutor with full power to make all trial decisions," thus preventing the defendant from receiving a fair trial. According to the lawyer, North would use 300 secret documents for his defense, one of which was that when Congress refused to provide aid to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels, former President Reagan and other high-ranking White House officials personally requested Saudi Arabia and some Central American countries to supply weapons to the Contra rebels and promised to compensate for it. Sullivan, the lawyer, said that the names of those countries were "critical" and would appear repeatedly in the trial.

The Supreme Court revoked the decision to suspend the trial of North on the 16th, thereby clearing the way for the trial. The next day, Judge Gesell announced that the trial would resume on the 21st. However, it can be predicted that difficulties in the trial will continue to arise.

　　政府、法院、检察官各执一端
    美国诺思案一波三折
    本报记者  仓立德
    令人瞩目的“诺思案”原定于１月３１日开庭。由于在出示白宫秘密材料的问题上，美国司法部、联邦特别法庭和检察官之间再度发生争执，致使开庭耽搁达两个星期。
    在此次审判中，“伊朗门”事件核心人物、前白宫国家安全委员会官员诺思面临１２项起诉，主要罪名是妨碍调查、向国会提供假证、私自篡改、转移、销毁政府文件等。而涉嫌私自将卖给伊朗军火的利润转手尼加拉瓜反政府武装的两项关键罪状，由于牵涉所谓“国家安全”问题，已于年初宣布撤销。但是，司法部发觉诺思仍将公开一些危及国家安全的秘密材料，遂于２月８日介入此案，要求法官格塞尔下令禁止诺思泄密。格塞尔拒绝了司法部的要求，说不让被告出示证据不是公正的审判，而是一场“滑稽戏”，并明确表示在次日晨陪审团宣誓后开庭。
    其后，司法部长索恩伯格两度向哥伦比亚特区巡回上诉法院提出上诉，要求暂缓审判，但均遭到驳回。沃尔什检察官公开指责索恩伯格企图“破坏他的独立性”，谴责其上诉的陈述“不真实”、“不准确”，“不知所云”，并认为情报部门对索恩伯格夸大了审判中暴露秘密材料的危险性。至此，开庭问题陷入僵局。
    索恩伯格无奈，只得向美国最高法院上诉。１２日，伦奎斯特大法官批准了司法部关于搁置审判的要求。当天，司法部与检察官就如何保护政府机密问题达成妥协，并将协议送交格塞尔。协议规定，检察官与司法部长将在审判中共同提议限制使用有争议的秘密材料，并允许司法部长在需要时可行使国会“秘密信息程序法案”所赋予的权力，随时干预审判。
    格塞尔次日表示，他不允许司法部长用禁止公开个人秘密文件的证明书来中断审判，除非要求撤销对诺思的全部起诉或１２项罪状中的任何一项；只有检察官有权提出此类证明书。他说，法庭有责任按照宪法规定在刑事案中保护被告，每位公民均有权在审判中公正、充分地出示辩护证据，也即是说，不能在刑事审判中加入政治因素。如果不能达到公正辩护，他将停止审判。
    诺思辩护律师的反应则更加激烈。他们指责说，新的起诉方案实际上保证了司法部长“在审判中的关键作用”，使诺思面对两种决定权，而不是“唯一拥有充分权力作出全部审判决定的检察官”，因此被告不能得到公正审判。据律师透露，诺思将使用３００份秘密文件为自己辩护，其中之一是，在国会拒绝为尼加拉瓜反政府武装提供援助时，前总统里根和白宫其他高级官员曾亲自要求沙特阿拉伯及一些中美洲国家向尼反政府武装运送武器，并答应为此给予报偿。苏利文律师说，那些国家的名称是“关键性的”，将在审判中反复出现。
    最高法院１６日撤销了搁置审判诺思的决定，从而为开庭廓清了道路，次日，格塞尔法官才宣布于２１日复庭。但可以预料，审判中难题还将不断出现。
