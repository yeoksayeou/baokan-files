The underwater cofferdam project at Sichuan's Gongzui Power Station, built by the navy, has been completed. This marks a crucial victory in the three-year effort to renovate the power station's dam.

The underwater cofferdam is a key component of the dam renovation project. It is 72 meters long, 28 meters wide, and 34 meters high, and was successfully constructed without interrupting the water flow or stopping the power supply. The director of Gongzui Power Plant told reporters that constructing a cofferdam without stopping the water flow or power supply is unprecedented in China and rare in the world. Completing such a project in just over 300 days during two dry seasons is a miracle.

Located downstream of the Dadu River, Gongzui Power Station is the largest hydropower base in southwestern China. Due to years of erosion from floods, numerous cavities have formed in the spillway, the dividing wall, and the log flume, gradually extending towards the powerhouse and the dam, posing a serious threat to the safety of the power station and the lives and property of people downstream.

In August 1987, the Sichuan Electric Power Bureau sought assistance from the navy. The navy's leadership immediately dispatched a team of underwater construction and rescue personnel, who, together with engineers from the original Seventh Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power, began the construction.

Building the underwater cofferdam involved clearing stones, erecting formwork, driving anchor bolts, and pouring concrete, all at a depth of over 30 meters. The short construction period, lack of detailed geological data, cold and murky river water, and the inability to use large machinery made the task extremely challenging. The navy soldiers faced these difficulties head-on, working with local engineering technicians to develop more than ten new technologies, significantly accelerating the project's progress.

During the construction, the soldiers performed over 4,000 dives, accumulating more than 20,000 hours of underwater work. They removed 5,300 cubic meters of stones, poured 29,000 cubic meters of concrete underwater, and completed the project a year ahead of schedule, saving the country 50 million yuan. The overall quality of the project met the design requirements.

　　海军“水下尖兵”饮誉龚嘴电站
    大坝整治工程潜堰围堰竣工
    本报成都２月２日电  新华社记者曹国强、本报记者沈纯报道：由海军指战员承建的四川龚嘴电站潜堰围堰工程日前竣工。至此，进行３年的电站大坝整治工程获得了关键性胜利。
    潜堰围堰是整治电站大坝的一项重要工程。它长７２米、宽２８米、高３４米，是在不截流、不停电的情况下建造成功的。龚嘴电厂厂长告诉记者，不截流停电建造围堰整治电站大坝，国内仅有，世界罕见。在两个枯水季节的３００多天内完成这样的工程是个奇迹。
    位于大渡河下游的龚嘴电站是西南地区最大的水利能源基地。由于溢洪道长年被大水冲刷，分水墙和漂木道的数十个冲坑逐年向机房和大坝延伸，严重威胁电站和下游人民生命财产的安全。
    四川电力工业局于１９８７年８月向海军求援。海军领导机关立即调集一支水下施工和防救部队，与原水电部第七工程局的工程技术人员一起投入施工。
    建造潜堰围堰从清石碴、立模板到打锚杆、浇注混凝土，都是在水下３０多米处作业，加上工期短暂，地质资料不详，河水冰冷浑浊和无法使用大型机械，施工难度极大。海军官兵迎难而上，在地方工程技术人员的配合下，创造了十多项新技术，大大加快了工程进度。
    施工中，官兵们共潜水４０００多人次，水下作业２万多小时，清除石碴５３００立方米，水下浇注混凝土２．９万立方米，工期比原计划缩短１年，为国家节约资金５００万元，整个工程质量达到了设计要求。
