The World Bridge Federation held an award ceremony in Beijing today. Deng Xiaoping received the highest honor, the Gold Medal of Honor.

	Reported by Chen Zhao from Beijing: Today, Deng Xiaoping, honorary chairman of the Chinese Bridge Association, became the first person to receive the World Bridge Federation's Gold Medal of Honor.

	The World Bridge Federation decided last October at its executive committee meeting in Italy to establish a special award—the Gold Medal of Honor—to commemorate individuals who have made outstanding contributions to the world of bridge. The committee unanimously agreed to award the first Gold Medal of Honor to Deng Xiaoping.

	Deng Xiaoping developed a love for bridge during the tumultuous years of war and has continued to play the game ever since. He believes that playing bridge can exercise the brain and improve thinking abilities.

	Before the award ceremony, Wan Li, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, met with Mr. Howard and his wife, as well as Mr. Choi Kwok-hung, chairman of the Hong Kong Bridge Association. This afternoon, at the Great Hall of the People, Mr. Rong Gao-tang, chairman of the Chinese Bridge Association, accepted the Gold Medal of Honor on behalf of Deng Xiaoping from Mr. Dennis Howard, chairman of the World Bridge Federation. Mr. Howard said at the ceremony, "For the World Bridge Federation, today is an extraordinary day because we are awarding a great figure." He introduced that the World Bridge Federation currently has 83 member countries, 700,000 registered players, and over 50 million people worldwide who enjoy playing bridge.

　　世界桥牌联合会在京举行颁奖仪式
    邓小平获最高荣誉金奖
    本报北京２月２６日讯  记者陈昭报道：中国桥牌协会荣誉主席邓小平今天成为第一位获得世界桥牌联合会荣誉金奖的人。
    世界桥联去年１０月在意大利召开的执委会上，决定设立一个特别奖——荣誉金奖，以表彰对世界桥牌运动做出卓越贡献的人士，并一致同意把第一枚荣誉金奖授予邓小平。
    邓小平在戎马倥偬的战争年代就喜爱上了桥牌运动，此后长年不辍。他认为打桥牌可以锻炼大脑，提高思维能力。
    颁奖仪式前，人大常委会委员长万里会见了霍华德先生和夫人以及香港桥协主席蔡国雄。今天下午在人民大会堂举行的颁奖仪式上，中国桥牌协会主席荣高棠代表邓小平接受了世界桥联主席丹尼斯·霍华德先生授予的荣誉金奖。霍华德先生在颁奖仪式上说：“对世界桥联来说，今天是一个不平凡的日子，因为我们为一位伟大的人物颁奖。”他介绍说，世界桥联目前有８３个会员，７０万名注册牌手，世界上喜爱桥牌运动的人超过５０００万。
