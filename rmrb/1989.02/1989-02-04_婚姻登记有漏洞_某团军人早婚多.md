Title: Loopholes in Marriage Registration: Many Soldiers in a Certain Unit Marry Early

Recently, I conducted a survey on the marital status of soldiers in a certain unit stationed in Shaanxi. I discovered that early marriage is quite prevalent among the soldiers. Out of the 98 married soldiers I surveyed, 73 had married before reaching the legal age, with the youngest being only 19 years old. Most of these soldiers did not have the necessary proof from their military political departments when they registered their marriages. So, how did they manage to get through?

Some marriage registration officials treat the Marriage Law as a joke. According to the married soldiers, a significant number of them obtained their marriage certificates through backdoor deals arranged by their parents and friends. For instance, a deputy squad leader was forced by his parents to marry his childhood betrothed, a cousin, during a home visit last year. Although he was only 20 years old and the cousin was a close relative, he initially disagreed with the marriage. However, he couldn't resist his parents' pressure and was eventually forced to register the marriage at the township government office, obtaining the marriage certificate through a familiar intermediary. It was not until August last year that the platoon cadres learned of this situation, persuaded the soldier's parents, and helped him divorce his cousin.

Some officials in charge of marriage registration lack a sense of responsibility. For example, a soldier from Sichuan was called back home by his father using a fake telegram last November and was forced to marry a girl from his village. At that time, the soldier was 19 years old, and the girl was 18. To facilitate the marriage registration, they altered the proof issued by the village committee. Normally, such "flaws" should be easy to detect, but the relevant officials at the township government office did not even look at the proof from the village committee and issued the marriage certificate without hesitation.

According to regulations, soldiers must obtain proof from their military political departments at the regiment level or above before registering their marriages with the local government. However, some soldiers have their marriages registered using proof from their parents' work units or villages and townships. Many of these proof letters are written based on the soldiers' self-introductions and contain a lot of false information. Although some marriage registration offices are aware of this, they turn a blind eye and do not want to get involved in what they consider "other people's business."

I suggest that both the military and local authorities work together to promote the Marriage Law and the late marriage and late childbearing policy, taking measures to control the spread of early marriage.

### 婚姻登记有漏洞  某团军人早婚多

　　婚姻登记有漏洞
　　某团军人早婚多
    最近，我对驻陕西某团战士的婚姻状况作了一次调查，发现战士早婚现象比较严重。在我调查的９８名已婚战士中，结婚时未到法定年龄的竟有７３名，其中最小的才１９岁。这些战士在结婚登记时，绝大部分没有部队政治机关的证明。那么，他们是怎么过“关”的呢？
    婚姻登记机关少数工作人员拿婚姻法当儿戏。据这些已婚的战士反映，他们中很大一部分人的结婚证，是父母通过亲朋好友开后门搞来的。如一名副班长去年探家时，他的父母让他同从小结为“娃娃亲”的表妹结婚。当时他曾考虑到自己才２０岁，而且这位表妹又属近亲，不同意这门婚事。但是，他拗不过父母，终于被强迫同表妹去乡政府登记，并通过熟人开出了结婚证。直到去年８月，连队干部得知这一情况后，做通了这个战士家长的思想工作，才使他得以同表妹办了离婚手续。
    一些主管婚姻登记的同志责任心不强。如一个四川籍战士，去年１１月被父亲用假电报叫回家，让他同村里一位姑娘结婚。当时这个战士１９岁，姑娘１８岁。为了顺利办理婚姻登记，他们涂改了村委会开的证明。本来，这样的“破绽”是不难发现的，但乡政府有关人员给他们开结婚证时，连村委会开的这张证明看都没看就开绿灯放行了。
    按规定，战士结婚必须由部队团以上政治机关出具证明，然后到地方人民政府登记。但是，有的战士却由父母所在单位或村、镇出具证明后就去婚姻登记机关办理手续。不少这类证明信完全是根据战士的自我介绍来写的，水分很大。而一些婚姻登记机关对此虽有察觉，却睁只眼闭只眼，不愿多管“闲事”。
    建议部队和地方共同抓好婚姻法和晚婚晚育的宣传工作，采取措施，控制早婚风的蔓延。
