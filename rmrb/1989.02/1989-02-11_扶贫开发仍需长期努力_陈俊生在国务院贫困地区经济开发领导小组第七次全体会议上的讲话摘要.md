Since the State Council proposed the task of solving the food and clothing needs of the majority of the population in poverty-stricken areas during the "Seventh Five-Year Plan," the economic development of poverty-stricken areas has been underway for three years. The main issue now is whether we can complete the task assigned by the State Council on schedule and how to further complete it. Therefore, it is very necessary at this time to systematically summarize the work of the past three years, seriously analyze the current situation, and study and deploy the tasks for the next two years.

In recent years, the economic development of poverty-stricken areas has received high attention from the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and various levels of Party committees and governments, and has received widespread support from all sectors of society, making significant progress. According to statistics, in the past three years, about 60% of the impoverished households supported nationwide have solved their food and clothing needs. This means that after three years, half of the task has been completed, and the food and clothing needs of the people in poverty-stricken areas are gradually being alleviated. Moreover, some impoverished counties have already crossed the food and clothing line. More importantly, in recent years, under the care and support of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, poverty alleviation work has undergone a series of reforms, and various places have created and accumulated many pioneering and meaningful good experiences. The more important ones include: achieving a fundamental shift from purely scattered relief to comprehensive economic development; bundling various poverty alleviation and development funds together for unified planning and concentrated use, managing them by project; organizing and guiding developed regions to jointly develop resources with poverty-stricken areas, achieving large-scale horizontal cooperation between the east and the west; relying on capable individuals, as well as various commercial enterprises, service organizations, and civic associations to establish poverty alleviation economic entities, develop leading enterprises, arrange employment for impoverished households, and promote the development of commodity production by impoverished households; dispatching technical personnel to poverty-stricken areas to serve as deputy county magistrates for science and technology, undertake development projects, and promote practical technologies; organizing Party and government agencies and various sectors of society to support the development and construction of poverty-stricken areas, etc. Practice has proven that these are all effective measures. The achievements and successful experiences already gained should be fully affirmed and continued.

However, while affirming the achievements, we must also clearly see that the tasks of poverty alleviation and development in the next two years are still quite arduous. First, the remaining impoverished population that has not yet solved the food and clothing problem is mainly concentrated in minority areas, reservoir areas, mountainous areas, disaster-prone areas, endemic disease areas, and areas with difficulties in water supply for humans and livestock. According to statistics, among the more than 300 key poverty-stricken counties currently supported by the state, 141 counties are located in remote minority areas, accounting for 42.6%. Nationwide, there are still more than 10 million people and 7 million head of livestock facing water supply difficulties in poverty-stricken areas, and 7 million reservoir migrants have not been properly resettled, living in extreme hardship. Second, although some counties have solved the food and clothing problem first, the standard is very low, the foundation is fragile, and it is very unstable. The level of social productivity has not undergone fundamental changes, and the gap with developed areas is still widening. Some places encounter natural disasters and have a part of the population returning to poverty. For example, by 1987, the number of impoverished households in Hunan Province that had not yet solved the food and clothing problem had decreased to 2.6 million, but after a severe drought last year, it increased to 4 million. These areas still need continued support to enhance their self-development capabilities. Third, the current fiscal and credit tightening situation also has a certain impact on poverty-stricken areas that are in the initial stage of development. In this sense, completing the task proposed by the State Council is entering the most difficult stage of breakthrough.

Overall, in the past three years, poverty alleviation and development have achieved remarkable results, but to stabilize the solution to the food and clothing problem and truly achieve poverty alleviation and prosperity, long-term arduous efforts are still needed. Therefore, the arduousness of solving the food and clothing problem in the next two years and the long-term nature of the work of poverty alleviation and prosperity in poverty-stricken areas must be fully estimated. We cannot think that the food and clothing problem has been alleviated, and the task of economic development has been completed. The work of poverty alleviation and development can only be strengthened, not weakened, and there must be no slackening of effort.

Regarding the work for the next two years, specific arrangements have already been made. Here, three aspects are emphasized:

First, the economic development of poverty-stricken areas must resolutely implement the spirit of the Party Central Committee and the State Council on rectifying the economic environment, rectifying the economic order, and deepening reforms. This is the overall situation, and poverty-stricken areas are no exception. The key is to start from reality, adjust the investment structure and industrial structure of poverty-stricken areas economic development according to the changing situation and economic environment. From the situation of poverty alleviation and development in poverty-stricken areas over the past few years, poverty-stricken areas have rich natural resources both above and below the ground. The potential for developing grass-fed livestock and poultry, dried and fresh fruits, precious medicines, famous and special products, and industrial raw materials is enormous, with advantages that other regions cannot match. These are what our country and the market need the most. Developing these resources can not only help local people solve the food and clothing problem and achieve prosperity quickly but also form a large number of new commodity production bases, rapidly increase the effective supply of the market, and alleviate the pressure of shortages of agricultural products and industrial raw materials in the country. From this perspective, the next two years will bring certain pressures to poverty-stricken areas, but also create opportunities for poverty alleviation and development and for making new contributions to the country. Therefore, projects that violate the requirements of the State Council and non-production projects such as buildings, halls, museums, and institutions must not be started and must be resolutely stopped. Projects that are based on local resource advantages, can drive impoverished households to achieve prosperity, and increase the effective supply of the market should be selected and supported, with key support and general control, striving for development in adjustment and making contributions in poverty alleviation and prosperity.

Second, all poverty alleviation and development funds and materials must be bundled together for concentrated use to strive for higher efficiency. National fiscal and credit funds are currently very tight, but the State Council has decided not to reduce poverty alleviation funds, which shows the importance the state attaches to poverty alleviation work. Under the current situation, this is a great support. Therefore, we must concentrate our efforts and do everything possible to manage and use the existing poverty alleviation funds and materials well, improve the efficiency of use. According to the experience of various places, the key to doing this is to adhere to the principle of "unified planning, overall arrangement, orderly channels, unchanged nature, relatively concentrated, matching use, ensuring benefits, and each recording its merits," and bundle all poverty alleviation and development funds and materials for use. This is the established policy and principle of the State Council, and it is a reform that cannot be changed and must be resolutely and seriously implemented. Now, some places have done very well, such as Fujian and Henan provinces, with good results. But in some provinces and regions, funds and materials have not been arranged in an overall manner, used in a scattered way, with low efficiency, and even in some places, there have been cases of misappropriation, embezzlement, and withholding of poverty alleviation funds and materials. To overcome and completely reverse this situation, it must be emphasized again that in the future, all types of poverty alleviation funds and materials must be bundled together for overall arrangement and concentrated use on the one hand, and on the other hand, strengthen management and supervision. All acts of corruption, embezzlement, private division, and misappropriation of poverty alleviation funds and materials must be severely punished, with no leniency or softness. At the same time, the transparency of the allocation and management of poverty alleviation funds and materials should be improved. Media supervision should be welcomed, and there should be no fear of media and journalists exposing problems. It is foolish to be afraid of exposing problems.

Third, all levels of government must, in accordance with the requirements of the central and state councils, definitely put poverty alleviation as an important economic and political task on the agenda, with the main responsible comrades personally overseeing and strengthening leadership. This is a common and important experience in various places. Now, some provincial leaders attach great importance to poverty alleviation work, with fast progress and good results in poverty alleviation and development, but there are also some places that have not put this work on the agenda, with insufficient measures, and slow progress in poverty alleviation and development. Therefore, it is hoped that all places will, with a high sense of responsibility to the people, strive to strengthen the leadership of poverty alleviation work, concentrate forces to fight the battle of solving the food and clothing problem, especially pay attention to solving the difficult problems of water supply for humans and livestock, resettlement of reservoir migrants, and prevention and treatment of endemic diseases, and combine economic development with family planning and population control work, striving to help poverty-stricken areas develop and achieve prosperity as soon as possible. At the same time, state organs and all sectors should continue to carry forward the spirit of poverty alleviation and assistance, and make new contributions to the development and construction of old, minority, border, and poor areas.

　　扶贫开发仍需长期努力   
    ——陈俊生在国务院贫困地区经济开发领导小组第七次全体会议上的讲话摘要
    自国务院提出“七五”期间解决大多数贫困地区群众温饱问题的任务后，贫困地区经济开发已经搞了三年。现在面临的主要课题是，能不能如期完成国务院交给的任务？如何进一步完成？因此，在这个时候，系统地总结一下前三年的工作，认真分析目前形势，研究部署今明两年的任务，是非常必要的。
    近几年，贫困地区经济开发得到了党中央、国务院和各级党委、政府的高度重视，得到了社会各界的广泛支持，进展比较顺利。据统计，三年来全国被扶持的贫困户已有６０％左右解决了温饱问题。这就是说，时过三年，任务过半，贫困地区群众的温饱问题正在逐步缓解，而且有一部分贫困县已经越过了温饱线。更重要的是，这几年，在党中央、国务院的关怀支持下，扶贫工作进行了一系列改革，各地都创造和积累了不少具有开拓意义的好经验，其中较为重要的有：实现从单纯分散救济向经济开发的整体性根本转变；将各项扶贫开发资金捆起来统筹安排、集中使用，按项目投放管理；组织和引导发达地区到贫困地区联合开发资源，实现东西部大跨度横向联合；依托能人，以及各类工商企业、服务组织、民间协会兴办扶贫经济实体，发展龙头企业，安排贫困户劳力就业，带动贫困户发展商品生产；选派科技人员到贫困地区出任科技副县长，承包开发项目，推广实用技术；组织党政机关、社会各界支持贫困地区开发建设等等。实践证明，这些都是行之有效的。对已经取得的成绩和成功的经验，要充分肯定，坚持下去。
    但是，在肯定成绩的同时也必须清醒地看到，今明两年扶贫开发任务仍然是相当艰巨的。一是现在剩下的尚未解决温饱问题的贫困人口主要集中在自然条件比较差的少数民族地区、库区、深山区、多灾地区、地方病高发区和人畜饮水困难地区。据统计，目前国家重点扶持的３００多个贫困县中，有１４１个县分布在偏远的少数民族地区，占４２．６％。全国贫困地区仍有１０００多万人、７００多万头牲畜饮水困难，有７００万库区移民尚未得到妥善安置，生活极为困难。二是虽然有些县率先解决了温饱问题，但标准很低，基础脆弱，很不稳定，社会生产力水平并未发生根本性的变化，而且与发达地区的差距仍在持续扩大。有些地方遇到自然灾害就又有一部分人返贫。如湖南省到１９８７年尚未解决温饱的贫困户已经下降到２６０万人，但去年一场大旱后又增加到４００万人。对这些地区仍需继续扶持，增强其自身发展能力。三是目前财政、信贷紧缩的形势，也不同程度地对处于开发起步阶段的贫困地区产生一定影响。从这个意义上说，完成国务院提出的任务，正在进入最困难的攻坚阶段。
    总的看，三年来扶贫开发已经取得显著成绩，但要稳定解决温饱问题，真正脱贫致富还需要进行长期艰苦努力。因此，对今明两年解决温饱问题的艰巨性和贫困地区脱贫致富工作的长期性必须有足够估计。不能认为温饱问题缓解了，经济开发的任务就完成了。扶贫开发工作只能加强，不能削弱，绝不能有丝毫松懈情绪。
    关于今明两年的工作，已经有了具体部署。这里，再强调三个方面的问题：
    第一，贫困地区经济开发必须坚决贯彻执行党中央、国务院关于治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序、深化改革的精神。这是大局，贫困地区也不能例外。关键是要从实际出发，根据变化的形势和经济环境，调整贫困地区经济开发的投资结构和产业结构。从这几年贫困地区扶贫开发的情况看，贫困地区地上地下蕴藏着丰富的自然资源，发展草食畜禽、干鲜果品、贵重药材、名优特产以及工业原料潜力很大，有其他地区难以比拟的优势。这些都是我们国家和市场最需要的。开发这些资源，不仅可以使当地群众尽快解决温饱、脱贫致富，而且可以形成一大批新的商品生产基地，迅速增加市场有效供给，缓解国家农产品和工业原料短缺的压力。从这个角度说，今明两年既为贫困地区带来一定压力，也为扶贫开发和为国家做出新贡献创造了机会。因此，对于违背国务院要求的项目以及那些楼、堂、馆、所等非生产性项目，一律不能上，要坚决下马。对于立足本地资源优势、能够带动贫困户脱贫致富、增加市场有效供给的项目，要择优安排，支持重点，控制一般，争取在调整中求发展，在脱贫致富中做贡献。
    第二，各项扶贫开发资金、物资必须捆起来集中使用，努力提高使用效益。国家财政、信贷资金现在非常紧张，但国务院已经决定扶贫资金不减少，可见国家对扶贫工作之重视。在目前情况下，这就是很大的支持。因此，一定要集中精力、千方百计地管好用好现有扶贫资金和物资，提高使用效益。根据各地经验，做到这一点，最重要的是按照“统一规划、统筹安排、渠道不乱、性质不变、相对集中、配套使用、确保效益、各记其功”的原则，将各项扶贫开发资金、物资捆起来使用。这是国务院的既定方针和政策，也是一项改革，不能改变，必须坚决认真执行。现在有些地方做得很好，如福建、河南等省，效果很好。但有些省、区的资金和物资还没有做到统筹安排，使用分散，效益不高，甚至个别地方还出现了挪用、贪占、截留扶贫资金、倒卖扶贫物资的情况。为克服和彻底扭转这种状况，必须再次强调，今后，各类扶贫资金、物资，一方面要捆起来统筹安排、集中使用，另一方面要加强管理和监督。对一切营私舞弊、贪污、私分、挪用扶贫资金和物资的行为要严加惩处，不得姑息、手软。同时，要提高对扶贫资金、物资分配和管理的透明度。要欢迎舆论监督，不要怕新闻单位和记者揭丑。有丑怕揭是愚蠢的。
    第三，各级政府要按照中央和国务院的要求，一定要把扶贫作为重要的经济任务和政治任务摆上日程，主要负责同志应亲自过问，加强领导。这是各地共同的重要的经验。现在有些省的领导同志对扶贫工作非常重视，扶贫开发工作进度快、效果好，但也有一些地方没有将这项工作摆上议事日程，措施不够得力，扶贫开发工作进展缓慢。因此，希望各地以对人民高度负责的精神，努力加强对扶贫工作的领导，集中力量打好解决温饱的攻坚战，特别要注意解决好人畜饮水、库区移民、地病防治等难题，要把经济开发与计划生育、控制人口增长工作结合起来，务求尽快帮助贫困地区发展起来，脱贫致富。同时，国家机关和各行各业要继续发扬扶贫济困精神，为帮助老少边穷地区开发建设做出新的贡献。
