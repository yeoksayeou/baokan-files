President Bush said on the 21st at a White House press conference that a recent report by the Federal Bureau of Investigation shows that the accusations against the morals of Tower, whom he nominated for Secretary of Defense, are "groundless."

Bush said he had seen part of the investigation report, and the various rumors about Tower are "unfair" and "without factual basis."

He said he would continue to support Tower and hoped that the Senate would approve Tower's nomination as soon as possible.

　　布什总统认为
    对托尔的指责无根据
    美国总统布什２１日在白宫记者招待会上说，联邦调查局最近的一份报告表明，对由他提名的国防部长托尔道德问题的指责都是“不堪一击的”。
    布什说，他看了调查报告的部分内容，有关托尔的种种传闻是“不公正的”，“没有事实根据的”。
    他说，他将一如既往地支持托尔，并希望参院能够尽快批准对托尔的任命。
