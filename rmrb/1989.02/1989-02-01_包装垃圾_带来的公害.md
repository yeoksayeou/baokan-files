Anyone who has been to West Germany knows that whether it is an ordinary supermarket or a luxurious shopping center, almost all products are packaged beautifully and meticulously. However, the abundance of packaging has resulted in mountains of waste. Statistics show that each citizen in West Germany produces approximately 374 kilograms of household waste per year, ranking sixth in the world. Of this, "packaging waste" accounts for 50% of all discarded materials. How to store and dispose of these wastes has become a headache for the West German government. If they are burned, they will pollute the air; if they are dumped into rivers and oceans, they will severely pollute the water quality; if they are piled up, they will become a source of land pollution; if the waste is transported to other countries, the cost is extremely high and it will also face resistance. Recently, West German environmental experts have called for the urgent improvement of the packaging industry. For example, milk and beverages can be changed to hard packaging for long-term use; flour, rice, and other foods can be packaged in bulk; some products that do not need packaging can be left unpackaged. Additionally, experts have called for a reduction in the production of single-use product packaging to decrease "packaging waste."

The experts' suggestions have been supported by the majority of people, but they have also faced opposition from many packaging companies that profit from this. There is also the issue of changing residents' shopping habits. However, most people have come to realize that the increase in "packaging waste" will harm humanity, and the improvement of the packaging industry is inevitable.

　　“包装垃圾”带来的公害
    凡去过联邦德国的人都知道，不论是普通的超级市场，还是豪华的购买中心，几乎所有商品都装潢得美观精致。然而繁多的包装却造成了垃圾山。据统计，联邦德国每个公民每年的生活垃圾约达３７４公斤，居世界第六位，其中“包装垃圾”占各种废弃物的５０％。如何贮藏和处理这些垃圾，已成为联邦德国政府头痛的问题。如焚烧，要污染大气；倒入江河和海洋，则严重污染水质；堆积起来，更是成为陆地的污染源；如将垃圾运往其它国家，不仅费用极高，而且还会遭到抵制。最近，联邦德国环保专家呼吁，应尽快改进包装业，如牛奶、饮料等可改变成硬包装，以长期使用；面粉、大米等其它食品可实行大包装，有些产品不需包装的就可不包装；另外，专家们还要求减少生产一次性使用的产品包装，以减少“包装垃圾”。
    专家们的建议得到绝大多数人的拥护，但也遭到不少以此赚钱的包装公司的反对。另外，也有一个改变居民购物习惯的问题。不过，大多数人已认识到，“包装垃圾”的增多将给人类带来危害，包装业的改进已势在必行。　　　步青
