The Ministry of Civil Affairs held a press conference today to announce the situation of disasters and disaster relief work in China in 1988. It was stated that 1988 was a year with frequent natural disasters, classified as a year of moderate to severe natural disasters.

The spokesperson for the Ministry of Civil Affairs, Wang Qingzheng, said that last year, China experienced a mix of droughts, floods, earthquakes, typhoons, and freezing disasters. The affected area of crops was 50.66 million hectares, with 4.86 million hectares completely destroyed. Grain production decreased by over 9.2 billion kilograms compared to the previous year. A total of 7,300 people died, and more than 2.58 million houses collapsed. The provinces and autonomous regions severely affected included Hunan, Hubei, Henan, Shandong, Guangxi, Guizhou, Hainan, Heilongjiang, Yunnan, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu.

It was reported that the drought in 1988 was the second most severe after the major drought in 1978. It primarily occurred in the main grain-producing areas along the Yellow River, Huai River, and the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, as well as in parts of Southwest, Northwest, and Northeast China. The affected area of crops reached 32.66 million hectares, with 2.73 million hectares completely destroyed. The floods in 1988 were also severe, with nearly 4 million people trapped by floods, over 6,000 people dying, and more than 1.6 million houses collapsing. The disaster areas' roads, bridges, and communication facilities were also damaged. 1988 was the year with the most severe earthquakes in China since the Tangshan earthquake, with 25 earthquakes of magnitude 5 or above occurring across the mainland.
