Fujian Provincial Library Donates Books to a Poor Township

	The People's Daily reports: On January 15, despite the biting cold and snow-covered mountains, Chen Yan, the director of the lending department of the Fujian Provincial Library, along with three other colleagues, traveled over a thousand miles to donate 1,500 books on literature and technology to the cultural center of Xinquan Township in Liancheng County.

	Xinquan Village is an old revolutionary base in western Fujian. Due to historical and geographical constraints, this township is one of the poorest in western Fujian, and the cultural life of the people is relatively impoverished. In April 1988, the Xinquan Township Party Committee and government made a firm decision to cut various expenses and allocate over 200,000 yuan to build a two-story, 700-square-meter cultural center. However, due to financial constraints, they were unable to purchase more books for the people to read, which caused difficulties for local factories, enterprises, and specialized households in finding reference materials. After learning of this situation, colleagues from the lending department of the provincial library in Fuzhou sent various types of books by special car.

　　福建省图书馆为贫困乡赠书
    本报讯  １月１５日，寒风刺骨，冰雪封山。福建省图书馆外借部主任陈炎一行３人，行车千里，顶着严寒，为连城县新泉乡文化中心站赠送文学、科技等书籍１５００册。
    新泉村是闽西的老革命根据地。由于历史、地理等条件的限制，该乡是闽西有名的贫困乡，群众的文化生活较为贫乏。１９８８年４月，新泉乡党委、政府横下心来紧缩各项开支，挤出２０余万元兴建了一座二层７００平方米的文化中心大楼，但因财政吃紧，一时无法添置更多的图书供群众阅读，给当地的厂矿、企业以及专业户查找资料带来困难。省图书馆外借部的同志知道此事后，便从省城福州用专车送来了各类图书。
