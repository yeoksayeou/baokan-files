The Ministry of Agriculture, after undergoing structural reforms, has expanded and strengthened its functions, becoming a department that not only comprehensively manages the industries of planting, animal husbandry, fisheries, state farms, township enterprises, and feed industry, but also a coordinating department for the macroeconomic management of the rural economy.

	According to the above guiding ideology and requirements, the Ministry of Agriculture's expanded and strengthened functions mainly include: researching and drafting the development strategies and policies for the rural economy, major economic policies, technological policies, and industrial policies; participating in the coordination of rural economic macroeconomic management and economic system reforms; participating in the research and formulation of agricultural product import and export plans and related prices, credit, and taxation policies, and working with relevant departments to comprehensively use various means to control the market and guide production; participating in the organization of agricultural and pastoral product circulation; coordinating the economic work of pastoral areas; guiding, inspecting, and supervising agricultural regional development work; organizing and coordinating the national feed industry, etc.

	With the deepening of rural economic system reforms, the interrelationships between various industries in rural areas are becoming increasingly close and interpenetrating; the supply of production materials, production, processing, and sales of various industries are extending to each other, forming an inseparable economic whole. Therefore, the State Council has tasked the Ministry of Agriculture to gradually strengthen the management and service of the pre-production, production, and post-production stages, and to form a mechanism; strengthen the comprehensive balance between various industries and the macroeconomic regulation of the rural economy.

	In accordance with the requirements of "transferring functions, delegating powers, adjusting structures, and streamlining personnel," the Ministry of Agriculture has transferred or delegated some micro-management functions to enterprises, institutions, and local governments. The department headquarters will focus on macroeconomic management.

　　农业部改革机构扩大职能
    强化对农村经济的宏观管理
    本报讯  经过机构改革的农业部，职能得到扩大和加强，成为既是综合管理种植业、畜牧业、水产业、农垦、乡镇企业和饲料工业等产业的职能部门，又是农村经济宏观管理的协调部门。
    按照上述指导思想和要求，农业部扩大和加强的职能主要是：研究拟订农村经济发展战略、方针，重大的经济政策、技术政策和产业政策；参与协调农村经济宏观管理和经济体制改革；参与研究制订农产品进出口计划和有关价格、信贷、税收等，协同有关部门综合运用各种手段调控市场，引导生产；参与组织农牧产品流通；协调牧区经济工作；指导、检查、监督农业区域开发工作；组织协调全国饲料工业等。
    随着农村经济体制改革的深化，农村各产业之间相互关系日趋紧密、互相渗透；各产业的生产资料供应、产品生产、加工、购销各个环节互相延伸，已成为一个不可分割的经济整体。因此，国务院责成农业部要逐步强化产前、产中、产后的管理服务，并形成机制；加强各业之间的综合平衡和农村经济的宏观调节。
    按照“转移职能、下放权力、调整机构、精简人员”的要求，农业部把一些微观管理的职能分别转移或下放给了企事业单位与地方。部机关集中精力抓好宏观管理。
