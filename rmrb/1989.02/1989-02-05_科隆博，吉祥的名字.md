At midnight on November 21, 1971, Premier Zhou Enlai met with Mr. Vittorio Kolumbo, who had just taken over as the chairman of the Italy-China Economic and Cultural Exchange Association, at the Great Hall of the People. Premier Zhou told him, "Kolumbo, this name is very auspicious, symbolizing peace!" "Kolumbo" means "dove" in Italian. The conversation lasted three hours. Kolumbo recalled the meeting, saying, "Zhou Enlai held my hand tightly. When I left the Great Hall of the People, it was already 3 a.m. The cold in Beijing was biting, but the sky was filled with stars." At that time, Kolumbo lingered over Premier Zhou's parting words, which were full of meaning: "Work for peace. I am an optimist. No matter what, today an event that was unimaginable in the past is happening: a Chinese Marxist and a foreign Catholic have talked amicably for several hours."

During World War II, the young Kolumbo led a guerrilla unit to fight against the German and Italian fascists. In 1958, with his rich knowledge of economics and trade and his outstanding social work achievements, he was elected as a member of the Italian Chamber of Deputies. After 1966, he held various ministerial positions in the Italian multi-party government, including finance, foreign trade, and postal services, and once served as the president of the Senate. Later, he also served as the deputy secretary of the Italian Christian Democratic Party. To bring the two ancient civilizations of Italy and China back together, Kolumbo, who held important positions in the Italian government at that time, along with the leader of the Italian Socialist Party, Nenni, firmly advocated establishing diplomatic relations with China and worked tirelessly for this cause. He wrote in the press, "The idea of keeping China isolated in international relations is absurd." Finally, on November 6, 1970, the two countries mutually recognized each other and established formal diplomatic relations. At the same time, the Italy-China Economic and Cultural Exchange Association, which Kolumbo advocated, was also established.

In the past 20 years, Kolumbo has visited China ten times, meeting with comrades such as Zhou Enlai, Deng Xiaoping, and Zhao Ziyang, and having many conversations.

Eusebio, who worked with Kolumbo, told us that although Kolumbo held important positions and was busy with countless affairs, he always cared about the cause of Italy-China friendship and the development of China. Thanks to his efforts, Milan and Shanghai, Florence and Nanjing, Venice and Suzhou became sister cities. The Italy-China Economic and Cultural Exchange Association, which he presided over, often held various Italy-China friendship activities in Italy, such as the "China Week," which is a very good project. It holds lectures, exhibitions, screens Chinese films, and promotes the achievements of the Chinese people in building their own country. He also actively promoted cooperation between Italy and China in science, technology, culture, and education. As Italian Ambassador to China, Mr. Solera recently told the author, "In terms of technological cooperation with China, Italy is the leader, ranking first, and among the several developed countries in the West, the total amount of aid provided by the Italian government to China exceeds that of all other countries. Moreover, the projects we donate are not commercial in nature, but focus on humanitarian aspects such as health, education, and training." Last March, the Beijing Emergency Medical Center built with Italian aid was completed in Beijing, and Kolumbo also contributed to this. Recently, to help Italian senators and financial magnates better understand China so that they can consider China more in parliamentary legislation and corporate decision-making, he traveled extensively, using his position, prestige, and influence to facilitate the visit of an Italian Senate delegation to China, consisting of dozens of people led by the vice-chairman of the Senate Finance and Treasury Committee. Among them, there were 16 senators, including experts from the powerful Milan Stock Exchange. Eusebio told us that although Italy has many political parties, no matter which party wants to have a good relationship with China, the first thing they think of is to consult with V. Kolumbo. Everyone regards him as the flag-bearer of Italy-China friendship.

V. Kolumbo always believes that the 21st century is the Pacific Century. He often says that a united Europe and China united can establish a tripartite world. He says, "What does a nation with more than 1 billion people and a long history and solid traditions, appearing in this socialist form, mean for international relations now and in the future? This 1 billion people who can both produce and consume, both sell and buy, is equal to the total population of the Soviet Union, the United States, Japan, and Europe. Will the actual power in the future shift from the Atlantic to Asia-America-Pacific?" He asserts, "Due to the existence of China, the world in the year 2000 will be very different... Whether from a historical perspective or from the perspective of cultural tradition, China is a great peaceful nation. As one of the developed countries in the West, Italy is very happy to continue friendly cooperation with China because China's progress will drive Italy and the world forward. Italy has always regarded China as the first partner in economic and trade cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region. Among the Western European countries, the trade volume between Italy and China ranks second. There are many favorable conditions for the two countries to carry out cooperation, and there is no competition between us, but mutual complementarity. China is rich in resources, and Italy is technologically advanced. Cooperation on the basis of equality and mutual benefit is beneficial to both sides." To promote this mutual cooperation and to help more Italians understand China, he still writes books in his busy schedule to introduce China. In November 1986, the Italian "24 Hours Sun" Publishing House published his "China Towards the Year 2000," in which he recalls the important content of his talks with Chinese leaders during his visits to China, and from the perspectives of world economy, international politics, philosophy, religion, and human culture, objectively, seriously, and yet passionately, fairly, and friendly, he reviews the difficult journey of China's development in the past hundred years. He is genuinely happy with the political and economic reforms that China is implementing. He borrows the words of a scholar to say, "This reform process may lead to a truly democratic system with strong vitality." Recently, Kolumbo told us, "This is my tenth visit to China. I remember my first visit in 1971, more than ten years ago. I have seen China advance and continue to advance. To build an independent and self-reliant new China, the Communist Party of China and the older generation of leaders led the Chinese people on a Long March, and now for the development of the economy and social progress, they are on a second Long March. This second Long March is more difficult. Although the second Long March has only begun for a few years, it has already shown great results. If the Chinese people struggled for survival 20 years ago, now they are striving with confidence for higher goals." (Accompanying photo: Premier Zhou Enlai meeting with Kolumbo)

　　科隆博，吉祥的名字
　　曹振寰　李南友
    １９７１年１１月２１日深夜１２点，周恩来总理在人民大会堂会见刚担任意中经济文化交流协会主席的维托里诺·科隆博先生。周总理对他说：“科隆博，这个名字十分吉祥，象征和平！”“科隆博”，在意大利文中是鸽子的意思。这次谈话进行了３小时。科隆博回忆这次会见时说：“周恩来紧紧握着我的手。我走出人民大会堂，已经是凌晨３点。北京的寒冷是刺骨的，但天空却挂满了星斗。”当时科隆博久久地回味着周总理临别时的那句意味深长的话：“要为和平而工作，我是一个乐观主义者。不管怎么说，今天正发生一件从前是不可想象的事件：一位中国的马克思主义者和一位外国天主教徒非常友好地交谈了几个小时。”
    二次世界大战期间，年方弱冠的科隆博奋不顾身率领一支游击队打击德、意法西斯分子。１９５８年，以他丰富的经济贸易学识和出色的社会工作政绩，当选意大利众议院议员。１９６６年以后，他在意大利多党政府中历任财政、外贸、邮电等部长职务，并一度担任参议院议长。后来又担任意大利天主教民主党副书记。为了使世界上意中这两个文明古国重新携起手来，当时，在意政府中担任要职的科隆博与意大利社会党领导人南尼一起，坚决主张与中国建立外交关系，不遗余力地为此奔波。他在报刊上撰文说：“那种企图让中国在国际关系中继续孤立的想法是荒谬的。”终于，在１９７０年１１月６日，意中两国互相承认，正式建交。与此同时，科隆博倡仪的意中经济文化交流协会也成立了。
    在过去了的２０年里，科隆博先后十次访问中国，与周恩来、邓小平、赵紫阳等同志会见，进行多次交谈。
    与科隆博一起工作的欧斯彬告诉我们，科隆博虽身居要职，日理万机，然而他时时关心着意中友好的事业，关心着中国的发展。由于他的促成，米兰与上海、佛罗伦萨与南京，威尼斯与苏州之间陆续结为友好城市。他主持的意中经济文化交流协会在意大利经常举办各种意中友好活动，例如“中国周”就是一个很好的项目，举行报告会，展览会，放映中国电影，宣传中国人民在建设自己国家中的成就。他还积极促成意大利与中国实行科技文化、教育事业的合作。正如意大利驻中国大使索莱拉先生最近对笔者所说：“在对华开展技术合作方面，意大利是首屈一指的，占第一位，在西方几个发达国家中，意大利政府向中国提供的赠款总额超过所有其他国家，而且，我们援赠的项目都不是商业性的，而是以卫生、教育、培训等人道主义方面为主。”去年３月，意大利援建的北京急救中心在京落成，这中间又有科隆博的一份功劳。最近，为了使意大利的参议员、金融巨子们进一步了解中国，以便在议会立法和企业决策时，更多地考虑到中国，他四处奔波，利用他的地位与声望、影响，多方斡旋，促成了一个由几十人参加的，以参议院财政与国库委员会副主席为首的意大利参议院访华团访华。其中，参议员就有１６人之多，这中间，还有实力雄厚的米兰交易所的专家。欧斯彬对我们说，意大利党派众多，然而不管哪个党，要同中国搞好关系，首先想到的是，先征求一下维·科隆博的意见。大家都把他看作是意中友好的旗手。
    维·科隆博始终认为，２１世纪是太平洋世纪。他常说，联合的欧洲与中国联合起来，可以建立一个三足鼎立的世界。他说：“一个拥有１０亿多人口并具有悠久历史和牢固传统的民族，以这种社会主义的形式出现，对国际关系现在意味着什么？将来意味着什么？要知道，这既能生产也能消费，既能销售也能购买的１０亿人恰恰等于苏联人、美国人、日本人和欧洲人口总和。实际支配权今后会不会由大西洋转移到亚洲——美洲——太平洋？”他断言：“由于中国的存在，２０００年的世界将会大不一样……不论从历史的角度，还是从文化传统的角度来看，中国是一个爱好和平的伟大国家。意大利作为西方发达国家之一，很高兴和中国继续友好合作，因为中国的进步，将带动意大利，带动全世界向前发展。意大利历来把中国当作亚太地区经济贸易合作的第一伙伴。在西欧各国中，意中贸易额已占据第二位。意中两国开展合作有着许多有利的条件，我们两国之间不是竞争，而是互辅。中国资源丰富，意大利技术先进，在平等互利基础上的相互合作，对双方都有好处”。为了促进这种相互的合作，为了使更多的意大利人了解中国，他在百忙中还著书立说，介绍中国。１９８６年１１月，由意大利《２４小时太阳报》出版社出版了他的《中国走向２０００年》，他在书中追忆了他访华时与中国领导人会谈的重要内容，并从世界经济、国际政治、哲学宗教和人类文化的角度，客观、严肃而又不乏热情、公正、友好地审视了近百年来中国曲折发展的艰难历程。他对中国实行的政治、经济改革，由衷高兴。他借用一位学者的话说：“这种改革进程可能导致具有强大生命力的真正民主。”最近，科隆博对我们说：“我已是第十次访华了。记得初次１９７１年访华，距今已十多年了。我亲眼看到中国前进了，并且还在继续前进。为了建立一个独立自主的新中国，中国共产党和老一辈领导人等率领中国人民进行过一次长征，现在为了发展经济和社会进步，又在进行第二次长征。这次长征更困难。第二次长征虽然开始没几年，但已见到巨大成效。如果说，中国人民２０年前艰苦奋斗不过是为了温饱，那么现在他们正满怀信心地为更高的目标在奋斗。”（附图片）
