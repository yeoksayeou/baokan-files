    南方将在四月派员赴北方
    新华社平壤２月２日电  汉城消息：朝鲜北方和南方已商定联合开发名胜风景区金刚山，南方的现场勘察人员２０余人在４月中旬将前往北方。
    这是南朝鲜经济界著名人士郑周永结束对朝鲜北方的９天访问后，于今天上午返回汉城时在金浦国际机场上宣布的。
    郑周永说，他在北方访问期间，经过同北方进行多次会谈，就如下３个方面的问题取得了一致的意见：一、双方联合开发金刚山风景区；二、南北方共同参加苏联西伯利亚和远东地区的经济开发活动；三、以合营方式扩建北方的元山造船厂和铁道车辆厂。
    汉城的一位高级官员今天上午说，当局将对郑周永北方之行的结果进行认真的研究。
