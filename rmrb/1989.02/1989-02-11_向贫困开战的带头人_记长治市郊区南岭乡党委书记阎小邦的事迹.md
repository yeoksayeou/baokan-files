"The people of Nanling don't want Yan Xiaobang to leave. If he goes, many things won't get done." This is what the people of Nanling often say to each other.

Nanling Township in the suburbs of Changzhi City, Shanxi Province, was a base area during the War of Resistance Against Japan. Up until 1985, it had changed little, with an average income of over 200 yuan per person, making it one of the poorer townships in the city.

In October 1985, Yan Xiaobang, then deputy secretary of the Baguang Township Party Committee, was transferred to Nanling Township to serve as the township head. Nanling is a small, impoverished mountainous township with extremely poor office conditions. Recruited officials had not received their salaries for over a year.

Yan Xiaobang, who had been exploring the path to prosperity, saw the potential in Nanling's high-grade iron ore. Nanling could use the coal from Lili, Daji, and Nan Village for smelting. He decided to act immediately, borrowing 400,000 yuan from elsewhere to build a blast furnace. He worked day and night with the villagers, quickly putting the iron factory into production. That year, they produced 3,200 tons of iron, earning 220,000 yuan in profits. In January 1987, Yan Xiaobang was promoted to secretary of the Nanling Township Party Committee. At the beginning of last year, he decided to use the funds allocated for renovating the township government compound to build a cardboard factory, recovering the construction costs by the end of the year.

In March 1988, their cardboard factory needed to weld a large beam. Due to unstable power supply, Yan Xiaobang stayed on the construction site during the day and slept with the lights on at night, waking up the welders as soon as the power came back on. However, just as the welders were ready, the power went out again.

Indeed, whether it was building the blast furnace, establishing the paper mill, or solving the drinking water problem, everything depended on energy—electricity. Nanling needed electricity to truly shake off poverty.

At an emergency meeting of township officials, Yan Xiaobang shared his thoughts with everyone. Good words need not be many, and a loud drum needs no heavy hammer. The decision was made, and the construction of the Mota Small Hydropower Station began.

After a month of surveying, it was decided to utilize the flowing waters of the Qin River. The villagers worked together, with 1,400 laborers crammed into the small village of Mota, which had only 150 residents. In just 50 days, they dug a 2-meter-deep, 7-meter-wide, 1,500-meter-long water channel at the foot of a rocky mountain.

For a poor township to undertake such a large project, all funds had to be self-raised. The people and officials of Nanling Township were silently supporting Yan Xiaobang. The water channel needed several hundred thousand yuan, and the accounts were settled with the people: labor in exchange for resources, no electricity fees for three years. Meanwhile, Nanling natives working outside also generously contributed. The township also allocated a sum of money and borrowed some funds. The financial issue was finally resolved.

The power station was originally planned to start construction and go into operation in the same year, but many people shook their heads and some sighed. However, the facts spoke for themselves. During the power station's trial run, Yan Xiaobang traveled back and forth between Nanling and Mota for several days. At the power station, he directed the laborers, making more than ten trips up and down in two hours. On December 20 of last year, the power station finally generated 320 kilowatts of electricity during its trial run.

Electricity brought light to the impoverished mountains and the joyful sound of machinery. The township provided electricity to 9 villages that previously had none, laying high-voltage lines to the edges of these 9 villages, installing transformers, and configuring rice hulling machines, flour mills, and electric motors. Finally, the township funded the laying of power lines to the remaining 3 villages, achieving electrification in every village.

What is Yan Xiaobang thinking about now? He is not unwilling to leave the mountains. In the plains, he has contracted land, and there is his paralyzed father... But his mind is filled with plans for the Qin River within Nanling's borders, aiming to achieve the grand goal of increasing the installed capacity to 1,500 kilowatts. This stubborn man cannot leave Nanling, and the people of Nanling cannot do without him!

　　向贫困开战的带头人    
    ——记长治市郊区南岭乡党委书记阎小邦的事迹
    潘跃
    “不能让阎小邦离开南岭，他一走好多事就办不成了。”这是南岭老百姓逢人便说的心里话。
    山西省长治市郊区南岭乡是抗日战争时期的根据地，截至１９８５年前仍变化不大，人均收入２００多元，在该市算贫困乡。
    １９８５年１０月任巴公镇党委副书记的阎小邦被调到南岭乡任乡长。南岭是贫困山区的小乡，办公条件极为简陋，招聘来的干部已一年多未领到工资。
    在致富路上探索的阎小邦，看准了南岭的高品位的铁矿石。南岭可以用犁川、大箕、南村的煤炭搞冶炼。说干就干，他从别处借资４万元建起了高炉。他和乡亲们一起没日没夜地干，迅速使铁厂投入了生产，当年产铁３２００吨，盈利２２万元。１９８７年１月，阎小邦由乡长改任为乡党委书记。去年初，他决定将准备整修乡机关大院的资金，用来建纸箱厂，到年底就收回建厂成本。
    １９８８年３月，他们纸箱厂要焊一根大梁。由于电供应不正常，阎小邦白天在工地，夜里开着灯睡觉，电一来就叫醒焊工。可是，当焊工准备好，电又停了。
    是啊！无论建高炉，搞造纸厂，还是解决人们的喝水问题，都离不开能源——电，南岭要靠电才能彻底脱贫。
    在乡干部紧急会议上，阎小邦把自己的想法告诉给大家。好话不用多说，响鼓不用重锤。拍板定案，磨滩小水电站工程上马了。
    经过一月勘察，决定利用长流的沁河水。山里人办事心齐，１４００名民工拥挤在只有１５０口人的磨滩村，５０天硬是在石头山脚下挖出了一条２米深、７米宽、１５００米长的引水渠。
    一个贫困乡，建这么大的工程，资金全靠自筹。南岭乡的群众、干部都在默默地支持着阎小邦。引水渠需要几十万，帐摊在群众身上：以工代资，３年不交电费。同时，在外工作的南岭籍人也慷慨解囊。乡里又拿出一笔钱、贷了一部分款。资金总算解决了。
    电站原计划当年开工，当年投产，许多人摇头，有的叹气。然而事实不得不让人叫绝。电站试车时，阎小邦一连几天往返南岭与磨滩。在电站，他指挥民工，在两个钟头内，来回上下十多趟。去年１２月２０日，电站终于试发电３２０千瓦。
    电，给贫困的山乡带来了光明，也响起了欢快的马达声。乡里为９个没通电的村通了电，把高压线架到这９个村的村边，安上了变压器，配置了碾米机、磨面机、电动机。最后，又是由乡出资，把电线架到了仅剩下的３个村，实现了村村通电。
    如今的阎小邦在想些什么呢？他不是不想下山。在平川的家，有承包的土地，有瘫痪的父亲……但他脑子里装满筹划南岭境内的沁河，要实现装机容量增加到１５００千瓦的宏伟目标。这个倔强的汉子怎能离开南岭，南岭人民更离不开他啊！
