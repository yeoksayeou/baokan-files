The compilation of "Biographies of Enterprise and Institutional Reformers," with the title written by Comrade Deng Xiaoping and jointly organized by the Central Propaganda Department of the Communist Party of China and more than 20 ministries and commissions of the State Council, is about to be published. At this significant moment when the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Party is celebrating its tenth anniversary, the publication of this set of books is a meaningful event and is worthy of recommendation to everyone.

Enterprise and institutional reform, especially enterprise reform, holds a crucial position in China's overall economic system reform. Large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises are the backbone of China's economy. The funds for modernization construction mainly rely on enterprises to accumulate, and price reform and wage reform ultimately need to be absorbed and undertaken by enterprises. Only with the deepening and success of enterprise reform can a good environment and conditions be created for the overall reform to proceed. Currently, in the process of implementing the policies of rectifying the economic environment, rectifying the economic order, and deepening the reform comprehensively as proposed by the Third Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, it is even more necessary to focus on enterprise reform, strengthen management, promote technological progress, and strive to improve the economic benefits of enterprises.

The practice of reform over the past decade has shown that it is a very arduous and complex task for China's enterprises and institutions to establish an operational mechanism and management system that meet the requirements of a commodity economy and modernization construction. To successfully carry out enterprise and institutional reform, a large number of reformers who are brave and skilled in reform are needed to organize and lead all employees to innovate and make breakthroughs. In this sense, it can be said that without outstanding enterprise and institutional reformers, modern enterprises and institutions cannot be established. This set of books compiles the biographies of enterprise and institutional reformers, introducing the achievements of enterprise and institutional reform through vivid and realistic materials, and summarizing the experience of enterprise and institutional reform. The fundamental purpose is to hope that the several million enterprise and institutional managers in China can, like the reformers in the book, under the guidance of the Party's basic line, better unite the broad masses of employees, and unswervingly push forward the cause of China's reform and construction.

The several hundred enterprise and institutional reformers reflected in this set of books, although they are in different positions and have their own characteristics, all possess the spirit of tenaciously struggling for the revitalization of China and the realization of the Four Modernizations. They are bold in exploration, diligent in practice, diligent in learning, and determined to make progress; they rely on the masses and respect science; they are not afraid of difficulties and strive hard. They were born in the reform and grew in the reform. The texts that record their advanced deeds are simple, but they are still very moving. We believe that the broad readers will be inspired, encouraged, and enlightened by this set of books, and will have an even firmer belief in reform, increased courage to fight against difficulties, and enthusiasm for the revitalization of China and the realization of the Four Modernizations, and will achieve greater success in their own positions.

In the great practice of China's ten-year reform, countless advanced figures have emerged. The enterprise and institutional reformers included in this set of books are only a small part of the brilliant stars. There are still many more reformers who have not been included in this set of books, and they have also created brilliant achievements and made precious contributions. We are walking on a path that our predecessors have never walked before. We need to continue to explore and innovate through reform to build China into a socialist modernized strong country, and we still need to deepen, improve, and perfect the experiences summarized in this set of books. We hope that the comrades who are included in the biographies will remain humble and diligent, and continue to strive. We also hope that everyone will work together to create more and better experiences.

Currently, China's comprehensive reform has entered a very important stage. There will definitely be difficulties and dangers on our way forward. However, historical experience and the achievements of enterprise and institutional reformers tell us that as long as we unite under the leadership of the Party, unify our thoughts, work together, invigorate our spirits, work hard, seek truth from facts, we will definitely be able to overcome difficulties and achieve the victory of comprehensive reform.

The reform underway on the vast land of China provides a broad historical stage for the descendants of the Yellow Emperor who aspire to the prosperity and strength of the motherland. We look forward to writing more brilliant sequels to "Biographies of Enterprise and Institutional Reformers" in the process of the great leap forward of the Chinese nation.

　　总结经验，把企事业改革推向深入   
    ——《企事业改革家列传》序
    张劲夫
    邓小平同志题写书名、中共中央宣传部和国务院２０多个部委联合组织编写的《企事业改革家列传》，将要陆续出版了。在具有伟大历史意义的党的十一届三中全会十周年来临的时候，出版这套书，是一件很有意义的事情，值得向大家推荐。
    企事业改革，特别是企业改革，在我国整个经济体制改革中占有重要的地位。大、中型国有企业，是我国经济的支柱。现代化建设的资金主要靠企业来积累，价格改革和工资改革最终要由企业来消化和承担。只有企业改革的深入和成功，才能为全面改革的深入创造良好的环境和条件。当前，在贯彻十三届三中全会提出的治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序、全面深化改革方针的过程中，更需要抓紧企业的改革，加强经营管理，推进技术进步，努力提高企业的经济效益。
    十年来的改革实践表明，我国的企事业要建立起适应商品经济和现代化建设要求的经营机制和管理体制，是一件十分艰巨而又非常复杂的工作。搞好企事业改革，需要有一大批勇于改革、善于改革的经营者和管理者来组织、领导全体职工进行开拓创新。从这个意义上可以说，如果没有优秀的企事业改革家，也就建立不起现代化的企事业。这套书为企事业改革家立传，通过有血有肉的人物形象和生动翔实的材料，介绍企事业改革的成就，总结企事业改革的经验，根本目的就是希望我国几百万企事业的经营者和管理者，能够像书中的改革家们那样，在党的基本路线指引下，更好地团结广大职工，坚定不移地把我国改革和建设的事业推向前进。
    这套书反映的几百位企事业改革家，虽然处在不同的岗位上，有各自的特点，但他们都具有为振兴中华、实现四化而顽强奋斗的精神。他们勇于探索，勤于实践；刻苦学习，立志进取；依靠群众，尊重科学；不怕困难，艰苦拚搏。他们在改革中诞生，在改革中成长。记述他们先进事迹的文字是朴实的，然而读起来仍十分感人。我们相信，广大读者将从这套书里受到激励、鼓舞和启发，更加坚定改革的信念，增强与困难作斗争的勇气，激发振兴中华、实现四化的热情，在自己的岗位上作出更大的成绩。
    在我国十年改革的伟大实践中，涌现出来的先进人物何止千千万万。写进这套书中的企事业改革家，只是灿烂群星中的一小部分。还有更多的改革家未能收入这套书中，他们同样创造了闪光的业绩，作出了可贵的贡献。我们正在走着前人未曾走过的道路。我们要通过改革，把我国建设成社会主义现代化强国，还需要继续探索创新，开拓前进。这套书中所总结的经验，有待于深化、提高、完善。希望入传的同志戒骄戒躁，继续努力。更希望大家共同来创造出更多更好的经验。
    当前，我国的全面改革进入了一个极其重要的阶段。在我们前进的道路上一定会有艰险。但是，历史的经验告诉我们，企事业改革家们创造的业绩也告诉我们，只要我们在党的领导下统一思想，同心同德，振奋精神，艰苦奋斗，求实探真，一定能够克服困难，夺取全面改革的胜利。
    中华大地上正在深入进行的改革，为有志于祖国繁荣昌盛的炎黄子孙提供了广阔的历史舞台。我们期待着在中华民族腾飞的进程中，《企事业改革家列传》写出更加光辉的续篇。
