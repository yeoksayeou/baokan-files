Salt lakes, deserts, marshes, and grasslands—typical plateau landscapes. A long, dragon-like train speeds by.

This railway, the highest in the world on average, transported 250,000 tons of goods and 520,000 passengers between Qinghai and Tibet last year, setting a new record for the line's operations. The entire 900-kilometer route is divided into two sections: half is named the "Culture Line" by the Lanzhou Railway Bureau, and the other half is named the "Civilization Line." The Delingha station, at an elevation of 2,960 meters, was recently named an "Advanced Intermediate Station" by the Ministry of Railways.

	“It Takes the Dedication of Several Generations”

Here, passenger trains run daily, with express trains operating twice a day and slower trains once a day. I boarded the 304th express train at Chahan and met the train crew leader, Wang Yibao, who shared the hardships of the train staff: “The girls, some as young as 16 or 17, others up to 22 or 23, really suffer on this train. They have to use the heater for half the year, from October to April. When the doors freeze, they have to pour hot water on them, and if they're in a hurry, they have to kick them or use a pickaxe to break the ice. The girls aren't strong enough, so a young man is assigned to each car.

“At places like Haergai, at an elevation of 3,200 meters, and the Guanqiao Tunnel, at 3,700 meters, they can't breathe, feel dizzy, and get sick, so they lie down in the cabin and don't dare move. They also have to rescue critically ill passengers who are new to the high altitude. If someone goes into shock, they give them medicine, acupuncture, and perform CPR in advance.

“In the interior, there are hospitals along the way. Here, it's the vast grasslands and the Gobi Desert, with only a few people at the small stations. What can you do? You have to pull them to Chahan, Delingha, Keke, and Haergai, the three or four major stations.”

	The “High Point” on the Qinghai-Tibet Line

Passing through the Guanqiao Pass, the Chahanuo work area has five or six young workers pushing instruments along the tracks. As soon as I got off the train, I was hit by a strong wind. This is one of the ten major windy spots in western Qinghai, and their bodies are shaking in the wind, moving with the sound of the inspection instrument.

The 28-year-old foreman, Tang Zhuoshen, spoke without taking off his mask: “We work outdoors for five or six hours a day, eating two meals in the morning and evening, and not stopping for lunch. There are 250 kilometers of frost damage along the line. If you wake up one night and find the ground has lifted the rails by 10 or 20 millimeters, which work area dares to be careless?”

The Guanqiao Pass is over 5,000 meters above sea level, and the 4,010-meter-long tunnel passes through the belly at 3,700 meters. To the west of the tunnel is a 34-kilometer section of small-radius curved tracks. As the “throat” of the line, the Guanqiao Tunnel has had problems with the track bed bulging and sloping due to soil, rock, and seepage in recent years. The ventilation workers, maintenance workers, and armed police here often enter the tunnel to drain water, lay tracks, and clear rocks and hail...

I learned that the water from the Xitie Mountain area contains a radioactive element and cannot be drunk; in the Guanqiao area, four or five work areas and stations mostly use the accumulated water in the tunnels. These two places have a high incidence of high-altitude sickness among workers, and pregnant women often miscarry. Female workers who are two months pregnant have to go down the mountain to preserve the pregnancy. A worker on the Qinghai-Tibet line told me: “Talking about dedication, the soldiers on the old battlefields sacrificed their youth, but the people on the Qinghai-Tibet line sacrificed their youth and their descendants, requiring the dedication of several generations.”

	“If We Can’t Have the Advantage of Terrain, We’ll Have the Advantage of People”

The Qinghai-Tibet line has grown from a few hundred people in 1983 to over 10,000 today. What kind of cohesion does it rely on? Pan Hande, director of the Ge'ermu office, said well: “In 1974, 1983, and 1984, workers from Lanzhou, Yinchuan, Xining, and other places took over this line three times. Now, many young workers are second-generation workers. No matter how hard the Qinghai-Tibet line is, someone has to do it. If we can’t have the advantage of terrain, we’ll have the advantage of people, perhaps this is a kind of plateau cohesion!”

Various levels of government and the railway system have paid attention to and cared for the Qinghai-Tibet line. Since 1985, 14 stations without power have been equipped with Yamaha generators, bringing light to small stations. 27 stations without water or with polluted water have been taken care of by the branch bureau, sending people to deliver water, vegetables, and food. Along the line, three large clubs have been built, and every station and district has been equipped with televisions, VCRs, and tape recorders, and game rooms have been set up, improving the previously monotonous life. Due to the harsh conditions, 21 sections of young men have been living single for a long time. Since 1987, hundreds of unemployed young women and minority women from pastoral areas have come to their midst. Love has blossomed along the Qinghai-Tibet line, and 8 pairs of lovebirds' houses were built along the line last year.

To let the new generation of Qinghai-Tibet people live and work in peace, various levels of youth organizations along the line have insisted on carrying out the “Tie People and Nurture Hearts” activity. At the Nan Mountain work area, at an altitude of over 3,600 meters, I ate meals made with tunnel accumulated water and found that the high-altitude climate had given the young men a unique complexion of “black and bright.” A dignified and pretty girl, Xiao Wei, was in love with a “black and bright” young man in the work area. Every weekend, everyone often holds a dance party in the game room.

There is also a story circulating here about a Guangzhou girl, Zhang Lijun, who was reluctant to leave the Qinghai-Tibet line. She worked in the forestry section of the Delingha railway bureau, and there were dozens of other girls who went with her, but only she was frail and suffered from high-altitude heart disease. Her parents, brothers, and sisters in Guangzhou found her a “good job” as a travel agency clerk during her leave last year, but none of this could keep her heart, and she couldn't bear to leave the desert that had given her love and a career, so she resolutely returned to the side of the primary school teacher on the railway.

I deeply understand that it is the “people's harmony” that has brought the two generations of Qinghai-Tibet people together. They are doing their best to improve its capacity, making the Qinghai-Tibet line, which has already invested 14 to 15 billion yuan, contribute more to the Four Modernizations. At present, the Qinghai-Tibet people still have many puzzles: there are more than 2,000 unemployed young people who cannot find a job; many “cowherds” still cannot find a “weaver girl”; those who have found a “weaver girl” still have to solve the problem of settling in the city; there are still many difficulties in schooling, medical treatment, and housing...

However, I know that no matter how hard and tired they are, the Qinghai-Tibet people will stubbornly continue, and the “dragon” on the Qinghai-Tibet line will run more cheerfully. The high Qinghai-Tibet railway is their soul!

　　巍巍高原飞长龙
    ——千里青藏铁路见闻
    本报记者  郅振璞
    盐湖、沙漠、沼泽、草原，典型的高原景观。长龙般的列车疾驰而过。
    这条世界上平均海拔最高的铁路，去年为青、藏两省区运送货物２５０万吨，旅客５２万人次，创该线营运史最好纪录；全线９００公里，一半被兰州铁路局命名为“文化线”，另一半被命名为“文明线”；海拔２９６０米的德令哈车站，最近被铁道部命名为“全路先进中间站”。
    　　　　“要有几代人的奉献”
    这里客车运行，快车两日对开，慢车每日对开。我从察尔汗登上３０４次快车，碰上客运段宁格车队王遗宝队长，他谈起了列车员的苦衷：“女孩子们，小的十六七，大的二十二三岁，跑这车真受累。她们一年要有半年烧暖气，从１０月烧到４月。车门冻了，从锅炉提开水烫，急了还得用脚踹，用铁镐砸。女孩子没劲儿，只好隔个车厢配个小伙子。
    “像过海拔３２００米的哈尔盖，３７００米的关角隧道，她们喘不过气，头晕恶心，就趴在乘务室不敢动。还得抢救初上高原的病危乘客。人要休克，就提前给药，针灸，做人工呼吸。
    “内地沿途都有医院。这里呢，大草原，戈壁滩，小站就那几个人，你说怎么办？只能拉到察尔汗、德令哈、柯柯、哈尔盖三四个大站。”
    　　　　青藏路上“制高点”
    途经关角山口的察汗诺工区，五六个青工手推仪器在轨道上作业，我一下车就让寒风刮了个趔趄。这里是青海西部十大风口之一，他们的身躯也在狂风中抖动，和着探伤器“呜呜”声移动脚步。
    ２８岁的工长唐照生，说话时不敢摘口罩：“我们一天野外作业五六个小时，早晚两顿饭，中午不停。沿线冻害达２５０公里，一夜醒来，地面把钢轨抬起一二十毫米，你说哪个工区敢粗心？”
    关角亚山海拔５０００余米，长４０１０米的隧道从腹部３７００米处穿过。隧道以西，是３４公里的小半径曲线轨道。作为“咽喉”的关角隧道，近几年因土质、山岩、渗漏等因素，道床上鼓变坡。这里的排风工、养护工和武警战士，常常进洞排水、垫轨、清理石块和冰雹……
    记者了解到，锡铁山一带的河水，带有一种放射性元素，根本不能喝；关角一带四五个工区、车站，大都食用隧道里的积水。这两处职工高原病多，女工怀孕容易流产，女同志怀孕两个月，就得下山去保胎。一位青藏线上的铁路职工对记者说：“讲奉献，老山前线战士是献青春，而青藏线人是献了青春献子孙，要有几代人的奉献哩。”
    　　　　“地利占不着，就占人和”
    青藏线由１９８３年数百人发展到现在万余人，靠的哪种凝聚力呢？格尔木办事处主任潘捍东说得好：“１９７４年、１９８３年、１９８４年，兰州、银川、西宁等地职工，三次接管这条线。现在，不少青工是第二代人。青藏线再艰苦，总得有人干啊。地利占不着，我们就占个人和，可能这是一种高原凝聚力吧！”
    各级政府及铁路系统是重视、关怀青藏线的，１９８５年以来，沿线１４个无电站配了亚马哈发电机，给小站带来光明。２７个无水站、污水站，由分局负责派人送水、送菜、送食物。沿线已盖起三个大俱乐部，站站区区配了电视机、录相机、收录机，办起游艺室，昔日单调的生活好转了。由于条件艰苦，２１个区段男青年长期单身生活。１９８７年以来，数百名待业女青年和牧区少数民族女工，来到他们中间。爱情之花沿着青藏线悄悄吐蕊开放，沿线去年矗起８幢鸳鸯楼。
    为让新一代青藏线人安居乐业，沿线各级团组织坚持开展“拴人育心”活动。记者在海拔３６００余米的南山工区，吃着用隧道积水做的饭菜，发现高原气候造就了小伙子特有的脸色“黑又亮”。一位端庄俊俏的姑娘小魏正和工区“黑又亮”的小伙子热恋着。每逢周末，大家还常到游艺室里举办舞会。
    这里还传诵着广州姑娘张立娟留恋青藏线的故事。她在德令哈工务段林场工作，同去的还有五六十个姑娘，唯独她身体瘦弱，患高原心脏病。在广州的父母兄妹，乘她去年探亲期间，给她找了一家旅游社服务员的“美差”，这些都未拴住小张的心，她舍不得那片给予她爱情和事业的戈壁滩，毅然回到那个铁路小学教师的身边。
    我深深理解，正是“人和”的心曲，把两代青藏线人凝聚起来。他们在千方百计提高它的运能，使已投资十四五亿元的青藏线，为四化建设多做贡献。眼下，青藏线人尚有诸多困惑：有二三千待业青年找不到就业门路；不少“牛郎”还找不到“织女”；找到“织女”的，城镇落户还待解决；入学、就医、住房困难尚多……
    然而我知道，再苦再累，青藏线人也会顽强地干下去，青藏线上的“长龙”会奔得更欢，高高的青藏铁路线，就是他们魂之所系啊！
