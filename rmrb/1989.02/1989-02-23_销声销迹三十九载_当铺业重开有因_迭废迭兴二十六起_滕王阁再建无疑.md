The pawnshop industry in China has seen a resurgence in several provinces and cities, with over 200 shops currently in operation. The first pawnshop in New China, the Chengdu Huamao Pawnshop, has accumulated a business volume of 3 million yuan. Unlike the past, today's pawnshop customers are mostly millionaires and specialized households who need to turn over their capital. Items pawned include motorcycles, color TVs, and refrigerators.

The Tenger Pavilion in Nanchang, one of the three famous towers in the south along with the Yellow Crane Tower and the Yueyang Tower, has been rebuilt 26 times. The main structure of the pavilion is currently under construction and is expected to be completed this autumn.

In Kunming, a case involving over 100 people attempting to break into a prison was recently concluded. The ringleader, Zhu Wenming, a farmer from Yulian County, Yunnan Province, coerced nearly 100 villagers to break into the detention center and free his son, Zhu Zheshun, who was detained for stealing a car. On September 7, 1988, the police shot and killed two of the attackers and injured one, capturing several others. The Yunnan Provincial Higher People's Court sentenced the ringleader, Zhu Wenming, to death, and the other six criminals to varying terms of imprisonment, ranging from less than seven years.
