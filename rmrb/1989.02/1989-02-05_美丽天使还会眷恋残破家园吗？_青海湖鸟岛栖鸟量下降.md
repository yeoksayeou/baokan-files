Title: Will Beautiful Angels Still Cherish Their Ruined Homes?

With the departure of the last group of bean geese to the south for winter, some bird specialists who have conducted research on the Bird Island in Qinghai Lake have raised a question: "Will these beautiful angels still cherish their ruined homes?"

A year-long survey of wildlife in Qinghai Lake and its surrounding areas has shown that the experts' concerns are not unfounded.

The Animal Room of the Northwest High Plateau Biology Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences provided the following data to the reporter: Among the four main bird species residing on the Bird Island—bean geese, brown-headed gulls, terns, and cormorants—the number of terns peaked at 12,100 in 1980 but dropped sharply to 100 by 1984. Since 1987, it has been rare to see terns on the Bird Island. The bean goose population has decreased by an average of 150 birds per year from 1985 to 1988, leaving only 3,500 by last year. During the same period, the number of empty nests on the "Cormorant Island" has been increasing.

Researchers believe that these signs indicate that the trend of declining bird populations on the Bird Island is irreversible. An American expert who has visited many bird protection areas around the world concluded, after seeing the Bird Island in Qinghai Lake, that the island could only survive for 5-8 more years—a seemingly alarmist prediction.

It is understood that the main reasons for the annual decline in the bird population on the island are the deterioration of the birds' living environment and human disturbance. Over the past few decades, due to natural and man-made factors, 1.88 million mu of grasslands in the Qinghai Lake area have degraded and become desertified. The number of naked carp in the lake has also sharply decreased due to overfishing. This poses a threat to the survival of bird species that feed on fish and grass. Another threat comes from the approximately 30,000 tourists who visit each year. After the water level of Qinghai Lake dropped, the Bird Island became a peninsula, allowing tourists to approach the birds' nesting grounds. The birds on the island have become skittish. The famous Bird Island is located at the mouth of the Buha River on the west shore of Qinghai Lake and is one of China's eight major bird nature reserves.

### 美丽天使还会眷恋残破家园吗？　青海湖鸟岛栖鸟量下降

　　美丽天使还会眷恋残破家园吗？
　　青海湖鸟岛栖鸟量下降
    据新华社西宁２月４日电  （记者李建宏）随着最后一群斑头雁飞往南方越冬，一些在青海湖鸟岛考察的鸟类专家发出这样的疑问：“这些美丽的天使还会眷恋它们残破的家园吗？”
    为时一年的青海湖及环湖地区野生动物考察表明，专家们的担忧并非杞人忧天。
    中国科学院西北高原生物研究所动物室向记者提供了一组数字：栖息鸟岛的斑头雁、棕头鸥、鱼鸥、鸬鹚４个主要鸟种中，鱼鸥在１９８０年最多时曾达１．２１万只，１９８４年锐减到１００只。１９８７年以后，鸟岛已经很难再见到鱼鸥与他鸟为伍了。斑头雁从１９８５至１９８８年平均每年减少１５０多只，到去年只剩下３５００只。同期，在“鸬鹚”岛上，人们见到的空巢也越来越多了。
    研究人员认为，种种迹象表明，青海湖鸟岛栖鸟量下降的趋势已无法扭转。一位去过世界许多鸟类保护区的美国专家，看过青海湖鸟岛后也作出了似乎是危言耸听的结论——鸟岛只能存在５─８年。
    据了解，鸟岛栖鸟量逐年下降的原因主要是由于鸟类生存环境的恶化和人类的侵扰。近几十年来，由于自然和人为的原因，青海湖区退化、沙化草场达１８８万亩。湖内青海裸鲤数量也因过度捕捞而锐减。这给那些以鱼、草为食的鸟类生存带来了威胁。另一个威胁来自每年约３万左右的游客。青海湖鸟岛因水位下降而变成半岛后，游客可以逼近鸟类栖息地，岛上的鸟变成了惊弓之鸟。闻名中外的鸟岛位于青海湖西岸、布哈河入口处，是我国８大鸟类自然保护区之一。
