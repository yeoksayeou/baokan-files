Currently, the peace efforts by the PLO and some Arab countries, as well as the frequent international activities aimed at promoting an international conference on the Middle East, have made the prospects for Middle East peace talks more active than ever, and the situation is indeed encouraging.

Recently, PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat once again declared that the PLO is willing to engage in direct dialogue with Israel to facilitate the early convening of an international conference on the Middle East under the auspices of the United Nations.

The rapid changes in the Middle East situation, especially the direct dialogue between the United States and the PLO, have forced the Israeli authorities to soften their rigid stance. Shamir, during his visit to France, also called for direct negotiations between Arabs and Israelis to resolve the Middle East issue, but he still insists on excluding the PLO. Shamir's attitude only shows that the Israeli authorities still lack the sincerity to resolve the Middle East issue.

　　诚意何在？
    当前，巴解和一些阿拉伯国家的和平努力，以及国际间积极促成中东国际和会的频繁活动，使中东和谈势头空前活跃，形势着实令人鼓舞。
    最近，巴解主席阿拉法特再次申明，巴解愿同以色列直接对话，以便尽早召开在联合国主持下的中东国际和会。
    中东形势的迅速演变，特别是美国与巴解的直接对话，迫使以色列当局的僵硬立场发生软化。沙米尔在访法时也曾呼吁阿以直接谈判解决中东问题，但仍坚持排除巴解组织。沙米尔的这种态度只能表明以色列当局至今尚无解决中东问题之诚意。
