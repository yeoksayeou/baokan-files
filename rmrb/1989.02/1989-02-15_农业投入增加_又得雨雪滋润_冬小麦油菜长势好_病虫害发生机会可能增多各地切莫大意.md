According to recent analyses by agricultural and meteorological experts, the current condition of winter wheat in northern China's main producing areas and rapeseed in the south is generally better than last year.

Recently, the Ministry of Agriculture invited several agricultural and meteorological experts to discuss and analyze the production situation of winter and spring crops in China. The experts pointed out that last year, due to continuous drought in autumn and winter in many places, the sowing and emergence of over 400 million mu of winter grains and 75 million mu of winter rapeseed were affected to varying degrees. However, various regions have increased their investment in agriculture and strengthened their efforts. In the northern 11 major producing provinces, the wheat sowing base is solid, with fertilizer use increased by 10% compared to last year. The areas of mechanized plowing and sowing increased by 12 million mu and 18 million mu respectively, the area of high-quality seeds expanded by 10 million mu, and the area of standardized wheat cultivation reached over 100 million mu. With these investments and measures as a foundation, following the widespread rain and snow on January 3rd, which was rare in recent years, the drought in most places was alleviated. Various regions seized the opportunity to transplant and supplement seedlings, and the winter wheat soon recovered its vigor.

In the south, the climate was favorable during the rapeseed sowing and transplanting period, and the seedling condition was better than last year. After the drought was alleviated, due to sufficient base fertilizer, the rapeseed seedlings regained their strength, and the current growth is better than the previous period.

According to long-term weather forecasts and satellite remote sensing monitoring data from the National Meteorological Administration, it is expected that after February, the temperature in China will be lower than average, and the temperature and humidity conditions in spring will be relatively normal. The possibility of a late spring cold snap is relatively small, which is beneficial for crop growth. However, the opportunity for pest and disease outbreaks may increase accordingly. Therefore, the experts remind various regions to be prepared for major and multiple disasters and strive for a bumper harvest of summer grains and oilseeds.

　　农业投入增加　又得雨雪滋润    
    冬小麦油菜长势好    
    病虫害发生机会可能增多各地切莫大意
    新华社北京２月１４日电  （记者鹿永建）据农业部门和气象部门专家日前的分析，目前我国北方主产区冬小麦和南方油菜苗情多数地方好于上年。
    日前，农业部邀请部分农业专家和气象专家座谈分析了我国冬春农作物的生产情况。专家们指出，去年，由于不少地方秋冬连旱，４亿多亩越冬粮食作物和７５００万亩冬油菜的播种和出苗受到轻重不同的影响。但各地重视和加强了对农业的投入，北方１１个主产省小麦播种基础好，肥料比上年增加了１０％，机耕、机播面积分别增加了１２００万亩和１８００万亩，良种面积扩大１０００万亩，小麦模式化栽培面积达到１亿多亩。由于这些投入和措施作后盾，适逢元月３日后南北普降一场多年来罕见的雨雪，多数地方旱象解除，各地抓紧移栽补苗，冬小麦不久恢复了元气。
    在南方，油菜播栽时气候适宜，苗情好于去年。旱象解除后，由于底肥充足，油菜苗缓过劲来，目前长势又比前期好。
    据国家气象局长期天气预报和卫星遥感监测的数据图象分析，２月份后我国气温将偏低，春季温湿条件比较正常，预计倒春寒出现的可能性较小，有利于农作物生长，但病虫害发生的机会可能会相应增多。因此，专家们提醒各地应立足抗大灾，抗多灾，力夺夏季粮油丰收。
