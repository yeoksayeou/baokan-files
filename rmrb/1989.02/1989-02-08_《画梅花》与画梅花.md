The late renowned Sichuan opera clown, Zhou Qihe, had a beautifully crafted folding fan in his home. On the fan's surface, there was a plum blossom painted by the renowned Chinese painter Zhang Daqian. The story behind this painting of the plum blossom is closely related to Zhou's performance of "Painting Plum Blossoms."

"Painting Plum Blossoms" was one of Zhou's signature plays. The story is set in the Ming Dynasty and revolves around Yang Yunyou, a talented and beautiful young woman from Qiantang. Due to a trick played by the lecherous monk Shikong, she ends up on a boat, becoming a bride without seeing her groom. In the scene "Painting Plum Blossoms," Yang Yunyou, who already has her suspicions, uses a plum blossom painting to test the groom's talent. As a result, the impostor groom, Huang Tianjian, reveals his true colors and makes a fool of himself.

In the 1940s, Zhou Qihe frequently interacted with Zhang Daqian, and they were very close. Zhang was an avid theatergoer and often watched Zhou's performances. One evening, while watching Zhou perform "Painting Plum Blossoms," Zhang suddenly focused his gaze on the folding fan held by Zhou, who was playing the role of the impostor painter Dong Qichang. Zhang frowned slightly and then shook his head. After the performance, Zhang Daqian told Zhou Qihe, "Your portrayal of the impostor Dong Qichang is excellent, but a great painter's folding fan wouldn't be a plain white one." Zhou immediately realized his mistake: "Oh, I've overlooked this for so many years! The fan should be exquisitely crafted and have an elegant design. But where can I find such a fan?" Zhang Daqian stroked his long beard and smiled, "I can paint one for you." He then opened a folding fan, took up his brush, and with a few strokes, painted a plum blossom on the fan. Zhou Qihe, watching from the side, exclaimed, "Wonderful! This will make it even more convincing to impersonate a great painter!"

As for Zhou Qihe's plum blossom fan, some of his colleagues wanted it, and some even offered to buy it. Therefore, Zhou became even more reluctant to part with it and kept it as a treasure, no longer using it on stage. Soon after, Zhang Daqian came to watch the performance of "Painting Plum Blossoms" again. He noticed that the performance still used a plain white folding fan. Zhang asked why, and Zhou lied, saying, "The fan you painted was lost." Zhang replied, "I can paint another one for you." This happened multiple times. Sometimes Zhou said the fan was lost, and sometimes he said it was taken by someone else. Zhang, however, didn't mind and painted one fan after another. Over the years, Zhou Qihe's home ended up with more than 40 beautifully painted folding fans by Zhang Daqian. Unfortunately, due to various reasons, by the time Zhou Qihe was in his later years, he was left with only one plum blossom fan.

### 《画梅花》与画梅花

　　《画梅花》与画梅花
　　杨方德
    已故川剧名丑周企何的家中珍藏着一把精美的折扇，扇面上有一代国画大师张大千先生画的一枝梅花。说起这画梅花的来龙去脉，那和周先生的演出《画梅花》，还颇有一段渊源呢！
    《画梅花》是周先生经常上演的拿手戏之一。戏中说的是明朝年间，才貌双全的钱塘秀士之女杨云友，因误入老色鬼世空和尚的圈套，而在船上成了难见新郎的新娘。《画梅花》一折，就是已有疑心的杨云友，以梅花画去试“新郎”的才学，结果弄得假冒新郎的黄天监丑态百出，真是半天云里跑牲口——露出了马脚。周企何在戏中就扮演冒充画家董其昌的假新郎。
    ４０年代，周企何与张大千交往频繁，亲密无间。张先生是戏迷，自然经常观看周先生演戏。一天晚上，他正看周先生演出《画梅花》。忽然，他把眼睛久久盯在了那周先生扮演的假董其昌手拿的折扇上，微一皱眉，又轻摇了摇头。事后，张大千对周企何说：“你扮演假冒的董其昌自然不错，但大画家手中的折扇，怎么会是一把白扇呢？”周企何顿时醒悟：“哎呀，多年疏忽了！他用的扇子，应该是做工精美，绘面高雅呵，可是到哪去找呢？”张大千抚着长髯一笑：“我送你一把如何？”接着打开一把折扇，拿起画笔纵横挥洒，一枝梅花就跃然于扇面上。周企何在一旁连声叫好：“妙！妙！这下冒充大画家就又多了一份资本啊！”
    且说周企何的那把梅花扇，同事们有的争要，有的出价索买，于是周先生就更舍不得了，潜心珍藏，不让它再上舞台了。不久，张大千又来看演出《画梅花》，只见戏中仍用的是把白折扇。大千问其原因，周先生谎称：“你画的那把梅花扇丢了。”大千说：“我再画一把就是了。”如此反复多次，周先生有时说丢了，有时说被人争要走了。大千呢，毫不介意，画了一把又一把。就这样，数年间，周企何家里就珍藏了４０多把大千所画的精美折扇。然而，不幸的是，由于诸多原因，到晚年的周企何老先生，就只剩下那唯一的一把梅花扇了。
