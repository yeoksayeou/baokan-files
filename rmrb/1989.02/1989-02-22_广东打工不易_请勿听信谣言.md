	Working in Guangdong is Not Easy: Do Not Believe Rumors
    Our reporter Liang Zhaoming reports from Guangzhou on February 21: In recent days, tens of thousands of migrant workers from other provinces have been stranded around Guangzhou Railway Station. The reporter conducted a thorough investigation and found that they all believed the rumor that "it is easy to find work in Guangdong" or were deceived and came here.

    Relevant departments disclosed to the reporter: Since the 10th (the fifth day of the Lunar New Year), about 100,000 migrant workers from other provinces have entered Guangzhou every day. Currently, about 30,000 people are stranded around Guangzhou Railway Station every day. According to a recent sample survey, more than 30% of the stranded people come from Hunan and Guangxi. They cannot find work and have to stay around Guangzhou Railway Station, exposed to the wind and rain, wandering the streets.

    Now, many migrant workers have learned the truth and are trying to return to their hometowns as soon as possible. At Guangzhou Railway Station, the reporter interviewed five young men and women who were about to board the train back to their hometowns in Henan. They sighed, "Guangdong is not as easy to find work as some people say." They expressed their intention to return to their hometowns and work hard in farming to contribute to the prosperity of their local economy.

    However, some migrant workers from other provinces are still stranded in various places in Guangdong, and some who are unaware of the truth continue to come. Therefore, the Guangdong Provincial Government and the Guangzhou Municipal Government have requested that all units in the province and city work together to help the stranded people return to their hometowns as soon as possible.

　　广东打工不易  请勿听信谣言
    本报广州２月２１日电  记者梁兆明报道：连日来，广州火车站一带滞留的外地民工数以万计，记者在他们当中明察暗访，发现他们都是轻信“广东好找工做”的话，或被人戏弄盲流而来的。
    有关部门向记者透露：１０日（年初五）以来，每天约有１０万外来民工进入广州。目前每天滞留在广州火车站一带的约有３万人。据日前的一次抽样调查，表明盲流人员中，３成以上来自湖南、广西。他们找不到活做，只好滞留在广州火车站一带餐风露宿，彷徨街头。
    现在，大批外来民工得知真情后，正想方设法早日返回故乡。在广州火车站，记者访问了正要上火车回河南家乡的５位青年男女，他们感叹说：“广东并不是像有人说的那样容易找工做。”表示要老老实实地回家乡耕田种地，为繁荣家乡经济出力。
    但是，也有的外地民工仍滞留在广东各地不走，还有的外地民工未知真相，继续前来。所以，广东省和广州市政府要求省市各单位通力合作，使滞留广东的人员及早返回家乡。
