In the fields, on the roads, and at construction sites across Pakistan, one can frequently see orange and dark green tractors in motion. These tractors are powerful, agile, durable, and have "MT" emblazoned on the front and sides. This is the "Mirat" brand tractor, produced in Pakistan. Pakistanis are proud of their ability to produce and export Mirat tractors, and workers and farmers affectionately refer to these domestically produced tractors as "brothers" or "comrades."

The Mainstay of Agricultural Mechanization

This January marked the 25th anniversary of the Mirat Tractor Limited Company. The company held a grand celebration. President Ishaq Khan sent a telegram congratulating "Mirat's Silver Jubilee," highly praising the company's role in Pakistan's agricultural mechanization over the past 20-plus years. Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto personally attended the groundbreaking ceremony for the company's new assembly workshop in Lahore and delivered an important speech.

Pakistan is an agricultural country, and the government attaches great importance to the development of agricultural machinery. In the early days of Pakistan's independence, landowners and farmers opposed bringing tractors into the fields, viewing them as inauspicious monsters. Due to traditional conservative thinking, agricultural mechanization progressed slowly. It was not until the early 1970s that the country had 5,000 tractors. In the past 20 years, Pakistan's agricultural machinery production has developed rapidly. By the end of 1988, the country had 280,000 tractors, half of which are "Mirat."

"Mirat" has won out over other domestic manufacturers with its superior mechanical quality and comprehensive after-sales service. It has also stood its ground in competition with imported tractors due to its good adaptability and low price. "Mirat" implements strict quality control during production, and each tractor undergoes several inspections before leaving the factory. The company has established over 100 sales outlets and technical service departments across the country, responsible for training tractor drivers, teaching them how to troubleshoot and perform simple repairs. If users encounter damaged or worn-out parts during use, a simple phone call will have the technical service department deliver the necessary parts and assist with repairs within 24 hours. As the saying goes, farmers cannot do without Mirat, and Mirat cannot do without farmers.

A Successful Example of Nationalization

The predecessor of the Mirat Company was a small company established in 1964 in Karachi. Initially, it only dealt in agricultural machinery parts. Later, it imported Massey Ferguson tractors from Britain, assembled them, and sold them across the country. In the late 1960s, the company moved to Lahore and was able to assemble 3,000 tractors per year. However, by the early 1970s, the company was on the brink of collapse due to poor management, lack of funds, and weak technical capabilities. In 1972, the Ali Bhutto government issued the "Economic Reform Order," and this company was the first to be nationalized, renamed Mirat Tractor Limited Company. The government appointed a new management team with expertise in enterprise management and technology, recruited technically skilled personnel, and invested in updating equipment. The company's operational policy shifted from simple assembly to importing main engines and high-precision parts, and also producing some components. Mirat Tractor Limited Company began its journey of self-reliance and development.

Today, the Mirat Company has become a backbone enterprise in the country's agricultural machinery industry and an important component of the national economy. Company General Manager Hashimi said, "Since nationalization in 1972, Mirat Company has grown into a fruitful tree. The company is continuing to develop rapidly, with the goal of achieving full domestic production." Currently, the domestic production ratio of Mirat tractor parts has reached 77%, saving the country the equivalent of 900 million rupees in foreign exchange annually, and contributing 100 million rupees in taxes to the federal government. Mirat Company has provided employment for over 40,000 people, and Mirat Company's stock price has been consistently rising on the Karachi Stock Exchange.

"Mirat" Steps onto the Global Stage

Due to the government's attention and the Mirat Company's efforts, the quality of the tractors produced by the company has been continuously improving and has gained a reputation in the Third World. In recent years, Mirat tractors have participated in international agricultural machinery exhibitions in Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. The company is also actively exploring ways to enter the international market. Last year, the first batch of 250 Mirat tractors was exported to Uganda. Thus, Pakistan has transitioned from a tractor-importing country to an exporting country, and Mirat tractors have become a product that Pakistanis are proud to export.

On January 26 of this year, during the celebration of the Mirat Company's 25th anniversary, the company officially began construction on a new assembly plant. Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto personally attended and presided over the groundbreaking ceremony, delivering an important speech. She called on engineering and technical personnel and the broad masses of workers to strive to learn new technologies, produce high-quality products, and work for the country's self-reliance in politics and economics.

The new expansion project will be completed in two phases over two years, with a total investment of nearly 100 million rupees. The factory will use advanced equipment to achieve automated production, install precise inspection and debugging equipment, and establish a new research and development institution. At that time, the domestic production ratio of Mirat tractors will reach about 90%, and annual production will increase to 18,000 units. The Mirat Company will play an increasingly important role in the development of Pakistan's national economy.

### “米拉特”——巴基斯坦的骄傲

　　“米拉特”——巴基斯坦的骄傲
    本报记者  任毓骏
    在巴基斯坦的田野里、公路上和建筑工地，到处可以看到一种漆成桔红色、墨绿色的拖拉机在往返奔驰。这种拖拉机马力强大、机动灵活、结实耐用，车头和两侧印有“ＭＴ”字样，这就是巴基斯坦出产的“米拉特”牌拖拉机。巴基斯坦人为能生产和出口米拉特拖拉机引以为荣，工人和农民亲切地把这种国产拖拉机称之为“兄弟”或“伙计”。
    　　　　农业机械化的主力
    今年１月，正值米拉特拖拉机有限公司成立２５周年，该公司举行了盛大的庆祝活动。伊沙克·汗总统打电报祝贺“米拉特银年”，高度赞扬说：“米拉特２０多年来在国家农业机械化进程中发挥了关键作用。”贝·布托总理亲赴该公司所在地拉合尔市主持了米拉特公司新建的安装车间奠基仪式，并发表了重要讲话。
    巴基斯坦是个农业国，政府很注重发展农机生产。说起拖拉机，在巴基斯坦独立初期，农庄主和农民曾反对把拖拉机开进农田，认为这是不吉祥的怪物。由于传统的保守思想，农业机械化发展缓慢，直到７０年代初，全国才有５０００台拖拉机。近２０年来，巴基斯坦农机生产迅速发展，到１９８８年底，全国已拥有拖拉机２８万台，其中一半左右是“米拉特”。
    “米拉特”以其优良的机械质量，完备的售后服务，胜过了国内其他厂家，又以其良好的适应能力和低廉的价格在同进口拖拉机的竞争中站稳了脚跟。“米拉特”在生产过程中实行严格的质量管理，出厂之前要经过好几道关口的检验。该公司在全国各地设有１００多个销售点和技术服务部，负责培训拖拉机驾驶员，教会他们如何排除故障和进行简单的维修。如在使用过程中用户发现零件损坏或老化，只要打个电话，技术服务部就会在２４小时内把所需的部件送来并帮助修理。正如人们所说，农民离不开米拉特，“米拉特”也离不开农民。
    　　　　国有化成功的典范
    米拉特公司的前身是个小公司，成立于１９６４年，厂址在卡拉奇。当时只经营农机零部件，后来从英国进口马塞·福古森拖拉机，由该厂安装并销往各地。６０年代末，这家公司迁往拉合尔，发展到１年能安装３０００台拖拉机。但到７０年代初，这家公司因为管理不善，资金短缺，技术力量薄弱，濒临倒闭。１９７２年，阿里·布托政府颁布了“经济改革法令”，这家公司首先被国有化，并更名为米拉特拖拉机有限公司。政府重新任命了精通企业管理和技术的经理班子，吸收有技术专长的人才进入公司，投资更新了设备。公司的经营方针也由原来的单纯从事安装逐步发展到进口主机和高精部件，公司也生产一些零部件。米拉特拖拉机有限公司开始了自力更生的发展进程。
    今天的米拉特公司已经成为国家农机工业的骨干企业，国有经济的重要组成部分。该公司总经理哈西米先生说：“在１９７２年国有化以来，米拉特公司已成长为果实累累的大树。公司正在持续快速发展，目标是使公司全部国产化。”目前，米拉特拖拉机部件的国产比例已经达到７７％，每年为国家节省相当于９亿卢比的外汇，向联邦政府上交１亿卢比的利税。米拉特公司为４万余人解决了就业问题，米拉特公司的股票价格在卡拉奇证券交易所一直看涨。
    　　　　“米拉特”走向世界
    由于巴基斯坦政府的重视和米拉特公司的努力，该公司生产的拖拉机质量不断提高，在第三世界已颇有名气。近年来，米拉特拖拉机多次参加东南亚、中东地区和非洲举办的国际农机展览，公司方面也在积极探求打入国际市场的途径。去年，首批２５０台米拉特拖拉机已出口到乌干达。至此，巴基斯坦已由昔日的拖拉机进口国一跃而为出口国，米拉特拖拉机也成为令巴基斯坦人感到骄傲的出口产品。
    今年１月２６日，在庆祝米拉特公司成立２５周年之际，该公司正式动工扩建一个新的安装工厂。贝·布托总理亲临主持了这项工程的奠基典礼并发表了重要讲话。她号召工程技术人员和广大工人要努力学习新技术，生产高质量的产品，为国家在政治上和经济上自力更生奋斗。
    新的扩建工程分两期，预计在两年内完工，总投资近１亿卢比。该工厂将全部使用先进设备，实现自动化生产，安装精密的检验和调试设备，还将成立一个新的开发研究机构。届时米拉特拖拉机的国产化程度将提高到９０％左右，年产量也将增加到１．８万台。米拉特公司将在巴基斯坦的国民经济的发展中起越来越重要的作用。
