		The Investor from Taiwan
		— A Record of Mr. Wang Ming, Chairman of Pinghu Industrial Park
		By Lín Lǐ, Reporter of This Newspaper

		Nine years ago, Taiwanese businessman Mr. Wang Ming came to Pinghu in Guangdong's Baoan County. He purchased a piece of land and established a garment factory.

		At that time, the two sides of the Taiwan Strait were in a state of tense confrontation, and there were no explicit regulations for Taiwanese investors in the mainland. Despite this, when Wang Ming proposed to develop and build in Pinghu, the Guangdong provincial government still gave him "special zone treatment" with various preferential policies.

		Under the special policies and various preferential treatments, Wang Ming quickly made money and became wealthy. He enthusiastically wrote a report, requesting the government to allocate him 2.5 square kilometers of land. He wanted to build Pinghu City, to establish factories, open shops, develop tourism, and aquaculture in this future city. The government reviewed his report and decided to first allocate him 1.8 square kilometers, and decided that the first phase of the development project would cover 583,000 square meters, and then gradually expand.

		The news spread to Hong Kong, and the media flocked to cover it. The Mirror Magazine published two long interviews with Wang Ming. At that time, Mr. Wang's parents were still in Taiwan. For safety reasons, Wang Ming's name was changed to Wang Yiming.

		With the easing of relations across the Taiwan Strait and the relaxation of the situation, the news of Wang Ming's investment and construction of Pinghu City in the mainland quickly became a major news item in Taiwanese newspapers. The Far Eastern Magazine praised Wang Ming as a pioneer for Taiwanese businessmen investing in the mainland.

		The media in Taiwan and Hong Kong repeatedly asked Wang Ming why he chose to invest in the mainland.

		Wang Ming explained that his ancestral home is in Shaoxing, Zhejiang. In 1946, he moved to Taiwan with his family. Five of his ancestors and dozens of his uncles, brothers, and cousins are now scattered across the five continents. Wang Ming's father flew to the United States to settle in 1988. Wang Ming, however, wanted to "return to his roots." He first went to Hong Kong, where he opened a bookstore and did business while observing mainland policies. When he saw that the country had decided to open up to the outside world, revitalize the economy, and rejuvenate China, he felt that the time had come to return to the mainland. In the spring of 1980, Wang Ming came to Baoan.

		"Why invest in the mainland?" Wang Ming asked himself and answered, "First, to provide a place for relatives and friends to return to, second, to prepare an investment environment for Hong Kong and Taiwanese compatriots and overseas Chinese who come to invest in the mainland, and third, to conduct an experiment on a new type of Chinese village..." He elevated his vision into four sentences: "Contribute to the Four Modernizations of the country, modernize the vast rural areas, double social wealth, and lay the foundation for future generations."

		To build a new village and a new city in the Pinghu area, Wang Ming bought excavators and heavy-duty trucks. He wanted to build hundreds of garden villas and thousands of hotel-style residential buildings and commercial buildings in the hilly terrain. At the same time, he wanted to establish integrated enterprises that combine agriculture, industry, and commerce. The factories and farms he envisioned would all use the latest equipment and technology, controlled and managed by computers. The living areas he envisioned would not only have modern shops, theaters, dance halls, and other entertainment venues but also schools, hospitals, swimming pools, gymnasiums, kindergartens, and nurseries.

		"What about the bookstore?" the reporter asked.

		"There will be one. The business that has supported four generations of our family, of course, cannot be missed." He not only wanted to open a bookstore but also wanted to establish a gallery and hold art exhibitions. He wanted to invite famous painters, calligraphers, writers, scholars, artists, and scientists from all over the country. He would not only provide these "masters" with comfortable living conditions but also provide them with good working conditions.

		The reporter saw Wang Ming's planning map for Pinghu City, his garment factory, and his villa area. The garment factory includes knitting, fabric, and cotton spinning. The residential area has already built 10 garden villas, the aquaculture area has planted a large area of fruit trees, the light industry area is still under construction, and the land is being leveled. Basic facilities such as electricity, water, and gas are also under construction. There is a strong sense of pioneering.

		The legally approved name, as approved by the provincial government, is "Guangdong Pinghu Comprehensive Industrial Park Co., Ltd." Wang Ming is the chairman and general manager. Although it has been 9 years, the actual time spent on development and construction is less than two years. During this long period, Wang Ming has indeed learned a lot from dealing with mainlanders. Wang Ming is very interested in the State Council's "Regulations on Encouraging Taiwanese Compatriots to Invest." He said that with this regulation, things would be much easier, and Pinghu could boldly move forward. He also made a suggestion, saying that "the sixth item under Article 3, 'Obtaining land use rights in accordance with the law and developing and operating,' lacks specific content and is not clear enough. When it comes to us, it becomes a problem." Wang Ming is happy that the overall situation is easing. The State Council's document is timely and encouraging to Taiwanese investors. In recent years, more than 30 Taiwanese companies have come to Pinghu to discuss investment and business. Wang Ming believes that the biggest difficulty for Pinghu has passed, and with the support of various levels of government, he will achieve his wishes.

　　台湾来的投资者
    ——记平湖企业城董事长王明先生
    本报记者  林里
    ９年前，台商王明先生来到广东宝安县的平湖地区。他买下一片土地，又开办了制衣厂。
    那时，海峡两岸还处于紧张对峙状态，内陆也还没有对台投资者的明文法规，尽管这样，当着王明提出要在平湖开发建设的时候，广东省府还是给了他“特区待遇”的优惠。
    在特殊政策的种种优惠下，王明先生很快赚了钱，发了财。他兴致勃勃，立刻写报告，要求政府批给他２．５平方公里的地皮，他要建设平湖城，要在这未来的城市里，开工厂，办商店，发展旅游业和养殖业。政府审查了他的报告，决定先批给他１．８平方公里，并决定首期工程的开发为５８．３万平方米，然后，再逐步扩展。
    消息传到香港，新闻界闻风而来，《镜报》杂志先后两次发表了对王明的长篇访问记。那时，王先生的父母还在台湾。为安全计，把王明改为王一明。
    随着海峡两岸关系的松动和局势的和缓，王明来大陆投资、建设平湖城的消息，很快成了台湾报刊上的重大新闻。《远见》杂志称赞王明为台商进入大陆投资的先锋。
    台湾、香港的新闻界，一再询问王明，为什么要来大陆投资。
    王明介绍说，他祖籍浙江绍兴，１９４６年随家迁往台湾。他的五位祖辈，数十名叔、伯、兄、弟，如今去了五洲四洋。王明的父亲１９８８年飞往美国定居了。王明呢？却要“落叶归根”。他先到香港，一边开书店，做生意，一边观察大陆政策。当他看到国家决定对外开放，对内搞活，发展经济，振兴中华的时候，觉得回归大陆的时机来了。１９８０年春，王明来到宝安。
    “为什么要来大陆投资呢？”王明自问又自答道：“一是要为亲属、朋友提供回归住所，二是向前来大陆投资的港台同胞和海外华侨准备投资环境，三是为中国式的新型农村做个实验……”他把他的设想升华为四句话：“为国家四化做贡献，为广大农村现代化，为社会财富翻两番，为子孙万代造根基。”
    为了在平湖地区建设新农村，建设新城市，王明买来挖土机，买来载重汽车。他要在这七高八低的山洼洼，建造数百幢花园别墅，建造数千套宾馆式的民用住宅和商业楼舍，同时，创办农工商相结合的联合企业。他所设想的工厂、农场，一律引进最新设备，使用最新技术，要用电脑控制和电脑管理。他所设想的生活区，不光拥有现代化的商店、戏院、歌舞厅和其他游乐场所，而且还要办学校，办医院，办游泳池，办体育馆，以及幼儿园和托儿所。
    “书店呢？”记者问。
    “有的。祖孙四代赖以为生的事业，当然少不了。”他不光要开书店，而且还要办画廊，办画展。他要邀请全国著名画家、书法家、作家、学者、艺术家和科学家，他不光向这些“家”们提供舒适的生活条件，而且要为他们提供良好的工作条件。
    记者看了王明先生的平湖城的规划图，看了他的制衣厂，还看了他的别墅区。制衣厂包括针织、布制和棉纺。居民区已建起了１０幢花园别墅，养殖区种了大片果树，轻工区还在开山，平整土地。通电、通水、通气的基础设施，也在加紧施工。很有一派开拓气势。
    经省府批准的法定名称是“广东平湖综合企业城有限公司”。王明是董事长兼总经理。说是９年，实际用在开发建设的时间，还不到两年。在这漫长的时间里，王明在同大陆人打交道上，确实学了不少东西。王明对国务院《关于鼓励台湾同胞投资的规定》很感兴趣。他说，有了这个规定，事情就好办多了，平湖可以放手大胆地干了。他也提了意见，说“那个第三条中的第六项‘依法取得土地使用权，开发经营’条目下，缺乏具体内容，不够明确。具体到我们头上，就成了难题。”王明高兴的是，大局走向和缓。国务院的文件适得其时，对台湾的投资者是一个鼓舞。近年以内，台湾方面有３０多家厂商前来平湖洽谈投资和作生意。王明相信，平湖的最大困难已经过去，在各级政府的支持下，他会如愿以偿。
