A Mother's Confession

A year ago, the famous American dancer Betsy Pattu died suddenly. The autopsy confirmed that her death was due to an overdose of drugs. How did this once-renowned dancer fall into the trap of drug addiction? Recently, Betsy's mother, with a heart full of remorse, revealed her own unfortunate experiences to the media, thus unveiling the mystery:

Countless mothers raise their children with joy and love, but I was an exception. I never had joy because a terrible shadow was cast over my young heart, and from it sprang a great "destructive force."

In 1928, I was born into a family filled with evil. My childhood was shrouded in endless terror. Before I was two years old, my mother died during a miscarriage. My father, however, despised me. I lived with my father and grandmother. This old woman was cruel to children, often whipping them endlessly. Of course, I was no exception.

At the age of six, my father would bring me to bed with him and molest me. Even today, the image of this shameless man is deeply etched in my mind. At seven, my father was killed by someone because of his evil deeds. I had to continue living with my grandmother, enduring her "love" expressed through a whip. After school, I dared not go home and would hide in the bushes until nightfall to reduce the physical torment.

After a few years, better days finally came. I moved to my maternal grandmother's house. She was kind and loved me dearly, bringing hope to my life. After graduating from middle school, I met a handsome and refined navy soldier by chance. We fell in love at first sight and quickly got married. I was eager to get married and start a family because I wanted to erase the humiliation of my childhood through love. However, reality was not as I had hoped. Soon, an inexplicable feeling burned in my heart. I would see a child and want to hit them, always wanting to fill my own emptiness with the child's physical pain. I knew this was cruel and not good for the child's growth, but I couldn't overcome this psychological barrier. I also didn't dare to seek help from friends. Sometimes, I would confide my troubles to a doctor, priest, or lawyer, but unfortunately, they didn't pay much attention. All I got were some tranquilizers or words of comfort, which did nothing to change my condition.

In my family, the one who suffered the most was my youngest son, Valery Pattu (later changed his name to Betsy Pattu). He was very handsome and intelligent, often doing good things to please me, but I couldn't be happy. I would just say "hello" or "goodbye" coldly, never hugging him or giving him a bit of maternal warmth.

Perhaps it's hard for ordinary people to understand how a mother could beat her child for no reason, but this was a common occurrence in Betsy's childhood. I remember when he was seven, one day after I beat him badly, I pushed him out the door and screamed, "Why don't you run away?" "I don't want to be your mother anymore!"

That night, poor Betsy still sneaked back home.

When he was ten, his sister took him to a ballet school to study. This way, he finally escaped my torment. In school, he studied diligently, excelled, and showed great talent in dance. With the teacher's guidance, he became an outstanding dancer and, at 20, a star in New York's dance world. However, as he rose to fame, he fell into the bad habits of drug use and alcoholism. As he told reporters, "After the performance, when I return to my residence, I feel very empty inside and use drugs and other means to punish myself. Sometimes, I even want to destroy myself completely."

This was his state of mind, and it's clear that his psychological development was closely linked to my abuse of him in his childhood.

On December 19, 1987, Betsy's fiancée found him dead on the sofa in a hotel room. The coroner said his death was due to an overdose of drugs, which caused me immense pain because the culprit behind this tragedy was me, his mother. After careful treatment, I have now recovered physically and mentally and have begun to realize my mistakes in abusing my child, but it's too late! I am sharing this experience with the public to let my other children and their peers learn from my mistakes and to advise men and women with similar conditions to seek help from society as soon as possible to prevent Betsy's tragedy from repeating.

### 一位母亲的忏悔

　　一位母亲的忏悔
    一年前，美国纽约的著名舞蹈演员比塞尔·帕屈列克猝然死去，法医验尸确认为吸毒过量。那么，这位红极一时的舞星是如何染上“毒瘾”的？不久前，比塞尔的母亲怀着忏悔的心情向报界披露了自己的不幸经历，从而揭开了这个谜底：
    成千上万的母亲都是怀着欢乐的感情扶养自己的孩子，而我却是例外。我从来没有欢乐过，因为在我幼小的心灵里就蒙上了一层可怕的阴影，并因此产生一种巨大的“破坏力”。
    １９２８年，我出生在一个充满邪恶的家庭里，童年生活在无限恐怖之中。不到两岁，母亲在一次流产中死去，父亲却十分嫌弃我。我和父亲同祖母住在一起。这位老妪待孩子很残暴，常常没完没了地鞭打他们，我当然也无法幸免。
    ６岁时，父亲就带我上床一起睡觉，进行猥亵。直到今天，这个无耻之徒的形象还深深印在我的脑海里。７岁时，父亲因在外作恶而被人打死，我只好继续跟着祖母过日子，接受她用皮鞭来表达的“爱护”。白天放学后，我不敢回家，独自躲在灌木丛里，到天黑才回去，以减少一些肉体上的蹂躏。
    过了几年，好日子终于盼来了，我搬到了外祖母家。她很善良，又很疼我，给我的生活增添了希望。中学毕业后，我偶然遇上一位英俊文雅的海军士兵，彼此一见便倾心相爱，并很快结了婚。我之所以急于要结婚成家，是渴望通过爱情来抹去童年的羞辱。可是，现实并不尽如人意，没过多久，一种莫名其妙的情感在我心头燃烧。我见了孩子就想打，总想用孩子肉体的痛苦来填补自己的空虚。我明明知道这太残忍了，不利孩子的成长，但又无法克服这一心理障碍，更不便向友人请教，以求帮助。有时，我也曾把自己的苦闷向医生、牧师或律师倾诉，但遗憾的是并没有引起他们的重视，得到的只不过是一些镇静药片或宽慰的话，丝毫改变不了我的病态。
    在我的家庭里，受苦最深的是小儿子瓦利·帕屈列克（后改名为比塞尔·帕屈列克）。他长得很漂亮，又聪明，常常为讨我的欢心做些好事，可我怎么也高兴不起来，只冷冷地说一声“哈罗”或“再见”，从来也没有把他抱起来亲一亲，给他一丁点母爱的温暖。
    也许一般人很难理解，做母亲的会无缘无故地毒打自己的孩子，但这却是比塞尔童年的家常便饭。记得他７岁那年，有一天我狠揍了他一顿后，就把他推出门外，狂叫：“你怎么不逃呢？”“我再也不想当你的妈妈了！”
    那天晚上，可怜的比塞尔还是偷偷地溜回了家。
    当他１０岁时，他姐姐带他去芭蕾舞学校学习，这样总算逃脱了我的折磨。在学校里，他学习勤奋，成绩突出，有舞蹈天才，经过老师的培养成了优秀的舞蹈演员，２０岁便成了纽约舞蹈界的一颗明星。然而，在他成名的同时，却染上了吸毒、酗酒的恶习。正如他对记者所说的那样，“演出结束后回到住所，心里感到十分空虚，便用吸毒等手段来惩罚自己，有时甚至想彻底毁掉自己算了。”
    这就是他的心态，应该说，这种心态的萌生与我对他童年的蹂躏是分不开的。
    １９８７年１２月１９日，比塞尔的未婚妻发现他死在旅馆房间的沙发上。法医说他的死是由于吸毒过量所致，这使我内心感到异常痛苦，因为制造这一悲剧的罪魁祸首就是我这个母亲。经过精心治疗，现在我身心初步康复，开始认识到自己虐待孩子的过错，可惜为时太晚了！我把这段经历公之于众，为的是让我其他的孩子和他们的同龄人从我身上吸取教训，并奉劝有类似病态的男人女人应尽早求助于社会，以免比塞尔的悲剧重演。
