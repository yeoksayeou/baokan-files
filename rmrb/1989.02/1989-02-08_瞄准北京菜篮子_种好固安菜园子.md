The People's Daily reports: Correspondent Duan Cunchang reports: Connected to Beijing's Daxing County by a bridge, Hebei Province's Gu'an County has proposed in its development of commodity production: "Aim at Beijing's vegetable basket, cultivate a good garden in Gu'an, and unite farmers and merchants to enrich the vegetable market." This year, Beijing Municipal Vegetable Company, Xicheng District Vegetable Company, and Gu'an County have contracted to purchase various vegetables totaling 71 million kilograms.

"Supplementing shortages, avoiding surpluses, and focusing on off-peak periods," this is the "eight-character policy" proposed by Gu'an County's leaders after investigating the Beijing vegetable market. County Party Secretary Xue Bochang said: "Relying on the city to eat is also not good, we have tasted all the flavors. For the service of the capital and the prosperity of Gu'an, we must strive to enter the city!" They learned that Beijing residents like to eat green peas. In the previous year, they imported a large number of seeds from outside and within the county, mobilizing the masses to plant 30,000 mu of green peas. Every year from late May to early June, it is the off-peak season for vegetables in the capital. Gu'an sends out 500 to 600 bicycles loaded with freshly picked green peas into the city every day. Basket after basket of tender peas turn into bundles of money, and the word "strain" brings in 4.5 million yuan for the county's farmers.

On the streets of Gu'an County, we saw rows of vehicles ready to transport vegetables, which are called the "nighttime assault force" by the people. This is a self-organized army of farmers selling vegetables in the city. They toil day and night, rushing to the city's early markets. Hard work brings in wealth, and in 1988, the county's farmers purchased 980 small transport vehicles, a 7 million yuan investment that the Gu'an County government did not contribute a single cent to, all of which were earned by the farmers in the vast sea of commodity economy.

Farmers choose the market, and the market guides farmers to join the vegetable circulation sector. Farmers from Sili Pu Village, Guo Songshun, joined 50-plus households of vegetable farmers to establish the "Melon and Vegetable Production and Sales Service Station," which quickly expanded to include more than 100 households of vegetable farmers from neighboring villages. The service station provides farmers with fertilizers, pesticides, and seeds on one hand, and timely exports farmers' melons, vegetables, and fruits on the other, which is welcomed by the farmers.

Expanding the "vegetable garden," are they afraid of losing the "rice bowl" (grain fields)? Gu'an County's comrades told the reporter that they have a solid agricultural foundation. The county maintains 400,000 mu of grain fields, and the grain output has increased every year for nearly ten years. Now, the per capita grain possession is 600 kilograms, and 15 million kilograms of grain are contributed to the state every year. 50,000 mu of oil crops are planted, providing 1.2 million kilograms of oil to the state every year. The county raises 4,700 head of beef cattle, 300,000 pigs, and 1 million poultry. On this basis, vegetable planting is suitable for the county, village, and household, and the county's "vegetable garden" has increased to 60,000 mu. Every year, more than 100 million kilograms of fresh vegetables are added to the city residents' "vegetable basket," and at the same time, more than 30 million yuan flow into the thousands of households in Gu'an.

### 瞄准北京菜篮子  种好固安菜园子

　　瞄准北京菜篮子
　  种好固安菜园子
    本报讯  记者段存章报道：与北京市大兴县一桥相连的河北省固安县，在发展商品生产中提出：“瞄准北京菜篮子，种好固安菜园子，农商联合起来丰富菜摊子。”今年，北京市蔬菜公司、西城区蔬菜公司和固安县订购各种蔬菜７１００万公斤。
    “拾遗补缺，避旺抓淡”，这是固安县领导干部调查北京蔬菜市场后，提出本县发展蔬菜生产的“八字”方针。县委书记薛伯昌说：“靠城吃城，也是不好吃的，酸甜苦辣都尝过。我们为了服务首都，富裕固安，硬往京城挤！”他们了解到北京市民喜吃青豌豆角，前年从外地和本县调运大批籽种，发动群众种植了３万亩小豌豆。每年５月下旬、６月初，正是首都蔬菜淡季，固安每天有五六百辆自行车驮着刚摘下的青豌豆角进京。一筐筐嫩豆豆变成一张张大团结，一个“挤”字为全县农民增收４５０万元。
    在固安县城街头，我们看到一排排待发的运菜车辆，被人们称为“夜间攻城部队”。这是由农民自发组成的一支进京卖菜大军。他们天天披星戴月奔波，抢赶京城早市。辛苦的汗水换来财源旺，１９８８年全县农民购买小型运输车９８０辆，这笔７００多万元的投资，固安县县政府没拿一分钱，全是农民在商品经济的大海里捞来的。
    农民选择市场，市场指导农民纷纷加入蔬菜流通领域。四里铺村农民郭宋顺联合５０多户菜农成立了“瓜菜产销服务站”，很快扩大到邻村１００多户菜农也联办。服务站一面向菜农提供化肥、农药、籽种，一面及时外销农民的瓜菜果品，受到农家欢迎。
    扩大“菜园子”，怕不怕挤掉“饭碗子”（粮田）？固安县的同志告诉记者，他们有一个坚实的农业基础。全县保持种植粮田４０万亩，近十年粮食产量年年增加。现在人均占有粮６００公斤，每年给国家贡献粮食１５００万公斤。种植油料５万亩，每年给国家提供油料１２０多万公斤。全县饲养４７００头肉牛，３０万头猪，１００万只家禽。在此基础上，种菜因乡制宜，因村制宜，因户制宜，全县的“菜园子”增加到６万亩，全年有１亿多公斤的新鲜蔬菜添进城市居民的“菜篮子”，同时有３０００多万元票票流进固安千家万户。
