Title: "Mutual Selection" Must Be "Mutual Understanding" — New Issues in University Graduate Allocation Reform

Mutual selection, as a major measure in the reform of university graduate allocation, has gradually expanded from a few pilot programs to more universities. This year, the State Education Commission has fully canceled the mandatory allocation plan, and many schools will allocate graduates through mutual selection and supply-demand meetings, proposing their own allocation plans.

Just stepping out of the planned allocation system, universities and employers, which have long been isolated from each other, face certain adaptability issues when they meet for supply and demand. Due to a lack of mutual understanding, various conflicts and difficulties arise during the allocation process.

Employers who rarely interact with universities are not familiar with the university's curriculum, course arrangements, and teaching content. Many units hold traditional views on "matching majors" and "searching for talent by the book" during supply-demand meetings. A staff member from Renmin University of China responsible for student allocation said, "Foreign language students are currently in high demand. Our International Politics Department places a strong emphasis on foreign languages in recruitment and teaching, and many students have high foreign language proficiency. However, many units are unaware of this situation and turn away as soon as they hear 'International Politics Department.' If employers had a deeper understanding of our school, the International Politics Department would no longer be a long-term major but a short-term one."

At last year's Beijing Region University Graduate Allocation Supply-Demand Information Consultation Meeting, a unit needed a secretary but was very strict: only students from the Chinese Literature Department were considered. A student from Renmin University did not understand this: "Actually, students from literature majors like philosophy, history, and politics can all handle this job. This restriction causes many students to lose opportunities."

Deputy Director Lin De of Anhui Institute of Technology told reporters that some employers focus only on the name of the major, knowing little about the content. Therefore, in the allocation process, a strange phenomenon occurs: some majors with allocation difficulties, once renamed, see their graduates quickly allocated.

A unit in Beijing this year needs graduates with a degree in economic law. Zhang Bing, a student from the Law Department of Peking University, went to discuss employment, but the unit's leader, upon hearing that he was from the Law Department, rejected him on the grounds of "not matching." Zhang Bing said in an interview: "Actually, the courses in the Law Department and the Economic Law Department are not very different, just with different emphases. But the unit leader was not aware of this."

Reports from various places indicate that not only do employers not understand universities, but universities also do not understand what kind of graduates employers need.

The closed education system of universities has caused a serious disconnect between education and social development, which is a flaw in China's higher education system that urgently needs to be changed. Currently, what new knowledge university students should possess in actual work, and what new demands the reform of the economic system places on talents, all these, universities are not very clear about. As a result, many graduates have outdated knowledge and narrow vision, making it difficult for them to adapt to actual work. Such graduates are naturally not welcome by employers.

Many enterprise leaders in Beijing have reflected that they hope university graduates not only have solid basic knowledge but also master practical skills and the latest knowledge, and have the ability to do specific work. These are exactly what current graduates lack.

At the same time, many employers also hope that universities can cultivate students' practical spirit. Baiyunshan Pharmaceutical Factory Director Bei Zhanhan proposed: "Our factory needs university graduates with practical, pioneering, diligent, and innovative qualities. We do not welcome graduates who are arrogant, cannot handle big tasks, and are unwilling to do small tasks."

Various people interviewed by the reporter all believe that to continuously improve the mutual selection reform measure, it is necessary to first strengthen mutual understanding. Although both sides have started to interact, the methods are still relatively simple, and the scope of interaction is not broad. Relevant departments should quickly establish an information network for mutual understanding between both sides. Only by continuously deepening mutual understanding can universities clarify their reform goals and train talents urgently needed by society. Employers can also obtain the graduates they are satisfied with.

### “双向选择”必须“双向了解”——大学生毕业分配改革中的新问题

　　“双向选择”必须“双向了解”    
     ——大学生毕业分配改革中的新问题
    新华社记者  宋斌  江钱峰
    双向选择，作为大学生分配工作改革的一项重要措施，已由个别试点，逐步推广到更多的高校。今年，国家教委第一次全面取消指令性统分计划，许多学校将通过双向选择、供需见面，自己提出建议计划，分配应届毕业生。
    刚从统包统分的计划体制中走出，长期各自封闭的高校和用人单位一旦供需见面，却显示出某种不适应性：相互不甚了解，致使在分配过程中出现种种矛盾和困难。
    过去很少与大学直接接触的用人单位，对高校的专业设置、课程安排、教学内容并不太了解，不少单位抱着“专业对口”的传统用人观念，在供需见面会上“按图索骥”。中国人民大学一位负责学生分配的同志说，外语类学生目前是抢手人才。我校国际政治系在招生和教学中对外语都很重视，许多学生的外语水平较高。但许多单位不了解这一情况，一听说是“国政系”便掉头就走。如果用人单位对我校有深入的了解，国政系就会从目前的长线专业变成短线专业。
    在去年举行的北京地区高校毕业生分配供需信息咨询会上，有个单位需要秘书，但卡得很死：非中文系学生不要。人大的一名学生对此很不理解：“其实文科的哲、史、政等专业的学生都可以胜任这项工作。这一限定，就使许多学生失去机会。”
    安徽工学院副院长来德林告诉记者，有些用人单位眼睛只盯着专业名称，而对专业内容知之甚少。因而在分配中就出现了这么一个怪现象：有些分配困难的专业，只要换个名称，毕业生马上就分出去了。
    北京某单位今年需要学经济法的毕业生，北京大学法律系法律学专业学生张冰去联系工作，单位负责人一听说他是法律学专业的，就以“不对口”拒绝了他。张冰接受采访时说：“其实法律学专业与经济法专业所学课程相差不大，只是各有侧重。但那个单位领导对此并不清楚。”
    各地情况反映，不仅用人单位不了解高校，高校也同样不了解用人单位究竟需要什么样的大学生。
    高校的封闭型办学，造成教育与社会发展严重脱节，这已是我国高教体制急待改变的弊端。而目前实际工作中大学生应具备哪些新知识，经济体制的改革对人才提出了哪些新要求，所有这一切，高校都不甚了解，以致不少毕业生知识陈旧、视野狭窄，一到实际工作中便难以适应。这样的大学生当然不受用人单位欢迎。
    北京市不少企业领导人都反映，他们希望大学生既有扎实的基础知识，更要掌握实用技术和最新知识，同时还要有做具体工作的能力。而这些，恰恰是目前毕业生所缺乏的。
    同时，许多用人单位还希望高校能培养学生的实干精神。广州白云山制药总厂厂长贝兆汉就提出：我厂最需要的是具有求实、开拓、勤奋、创新素质的大学生，最不欢迎那些眼高手低，大事干不来，小事不愿干的毕业生。
    记者在采访中接触过的各方面人士都认为，要不断完善双向选择这一改革措施，必须首先加强双向了解。目前双方虽开始接触，但方式还较简单，接触面也不广泛。有关部门要尽快建立双方相互了解的信息网络，只有不断加深双向了解，高校才能明确自身的改革目标，有的放矢地培养社会亟需的人才，用人单位也才能得到自己满意的大学毕业生。
