	Deputy Chairman of the National People's Congress Standing Committee's Law Committee, Song Ruxuan, said that the Law on Inspection of Import and Export Commodities is basically feasible.

	New China News Agency, Beijing, February 15 - Today, Deputy Chairman of the Law Committee of the National People's Congress, Song Ruxuan, reported to the Standing Committee on the results of the Law Committee's deliberation on the draft of the "Law of the People's Republic of China on Inspection of Import and Export Commodities." He said that the Law Committee believes that to strengthen the inspection of import and export commodities, to protect the legitimate rights and interests of all parties in foreign trade, and to promote the smooth development of foreign economic and trade relations, it is necessary to formulate this law. The draft is basically feasible. At the same time, some suggestions for revision were proposed.

	Song Ruxuan said that, based on the opinions of some committee members and legal experts, it is suggested to add a clause in the chapter on legal responsibilities: "In violation of the provisions of this law, for imported commodities listed in the 'Catalogue' and other commodities that laws and administrative regulations stipulate must be inspected by the commodity inspection authorities but are sold or used without inspection, and for exported commodities listed in the 'Catalogue' and other commodities that laws and administrative regulations stipulate must be inspected by the commodity inspection authorities but are exported without passing the inspection, the commodity inspection authorities shall impose a fine; if the circumstances are serious and cause major economic losses, the directly responsible personnel shall be held criminally liable in accordance with the provisions of Article 187 of the Criminal Law." "In violation of the provisions of Article 17 of this law, for exported commodities that are found to be unqualified after being sampled and inspected by the commodity inspection authorities, the same penalties as in the previous clause shall apply."

　　人大法律委员会副主委宋汝棼说    
    进出口商品检验法基本可行
    新华社北京２月１５日电  全国人大法律委员会副主任委员宋汝棼今天在向人大常委会作法律委员会对《中华人民共和国进出口商品检验法（草案）》审议结果的报告时说，法律委员会认为，为了加强进出口商品检验工作，维护对外贸易各方的合法权益，促进对外经济贸易关系的顺利发展，制定这个法很有必要，草案基本上是可行的。同时，提出一些修改意见。
    宋汝棼说，根据有的委员和法律专家的意见，建议在法律责任一章中增加一条：“违反本法规定，对列入《种类表》的其他法律、行政法规规定必须经商检机构检验的进口商品未经检验而擅自销售或者使用的，对列入《种类表》的和其他法律、行政法规规定必须经商检机构检验的出口商品未经检验合格而擅自出口的，由商检机构处以罚款；情节严重，造成重大经济损失的，对直接责任人员比照刑法第１８７条的规定追究刑事责任。”“违反本法第１７条的规定，对经商检机构抽查检验不合格的出口商品擅自出口的，依照前款的规定处罚。”
