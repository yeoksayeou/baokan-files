In Damascus, January 30th, our reporter Wu Wenbin reported that under the joint mediation of Syrian Foreign Minister Shara and Iranian Foreign Minister Velayati, after more than 30 hours of consultation and negotiation, the leaders of the "Amal" Movement and "Hezbollah," both belonging to the Lebanese Shiite Muslim faction, signed a comprehensive political reconciliation agreement here today.

Since the beginning of the year, the armed clashes between the "Amal" Movement and "Hezbollah" militias in the southern Lebanese region of Tufail have continued for nearly a month, resulting in over 150 deaths and many civilians becoming homeless. To mediate the killings between the Shiite Muslim brothers, Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Bisharat and Foreign Minister Velayati visited Damascus twice this month to consult with Syrian leaders and the leaders of the conflicting Lebanese factions on solutions, but due to the "Amal" Movement's insistence on "Hezbollah" handing over the killers of three "Amal" leaders in September last year and emphasizing that "Amal" should be solely responsible for security in southern Lebanon, the first mediation efforts by Syria and Iran failed.

Iranian Foreign Minister Velayati returned to Damascus the day before yesterday to continue mediating the dispute between "Amal" and "Hezbollah" with Foreign Minister Shara. After repeated negotiations and listening to various opinions, Syrian Foreign Minister Shara and Iranian Foreign Minister Velayati proposed a compromise plan, which was supported by the leaders of both the "Amal" Movement and "Hezbollah." The main contents are: strictly implementing the ceasefire agreement announced on the 25th of this month, ending the propaganda war between the two sides; establishing a coordination committee to handle relations between the two sides on the basis of mutual recognition and cooperation; establishing a joint command in southern Lebanon to coordinate and strengthen the struggle against Israel and its accomplices until all Israeli-occupied lands are liberated; the "Amal" Movement is responsible for security in the south until the legitimate government can control the entire security of Lebanon, while each side has the right to engage in political, news, and cultural activities.

According to a member of the Lebanese delegation, to reach this minimum agreement acceptable to both sides, Syria and Iran exerted pressure on the conflicting parties.

Iranian Foreign Minister Velayati said here today to reporters that he hopes this agreement will achieve a comprehensive reconciliation between "Amal" and "Hezbollah" and stop all violence and killings.

　　在叙利亚和伊朗外长调解下
    黎两派达成新停火协议
    本报大马士革１月３０日电  记者吴文斌报道，在叙利亚外长沙雷和伊朗外长韦拉亚提的共同调解下，经过３０多个小时的磋商和谈判，同属黎巴嫩穆斯林什叶派的“阿迈勒”运动和“真主党”领导人今天在这里签署了一项全面政治和解协议。
    “阿迈勒”运动和“真主党”民兵于年初在黎南部图法赫地区爆发大规模武装冲突以来，迄今已持续了近一个月，双方已有１５０多人死亡，许多平民无家可归。为调解同属穆斯林什叶派兄弟间的残杀，伊朗副外长比沙拉提和外长韦拉亚提分别于本月上旬和下旬两次抵大马士革与叙利亚领导人和黎巴嫩冲突双方领导人协商解决办法，但由于“阿迈勒”运动坚持要“真主党”交出去年９月杀害３名“阿迈勒”领导人的凶手，并强调由“阿迈勒”运动独自负责黎南部的治安，致使叙利亚和伊朗的第一次调解努力失败。
    伊朗外长韦拉亚提于前天再次返回大马士革，继续与沙雷外长共同调解“阿迈勒”与“真主党”的争端。经过反复谈判和听取各方意见之后，叙利亚外长沙雷和伊朗外长韦拉亚提提出了一项折衷方案，得到了“阿迈勒”和“真主党”双方领导人的支持，其主要内容为：坚决执行本月２５日宣布的停火协议，结束双方间的宣传战；双方成立协调委员会以便在相互承认与合作的原则基础上处理双方关系；在黎南部建立联合行动指挥部，以协调和加强抵抗以色列及其帮凶的斗争，直到全部解放被以色列占领的土地；“阿迈勒”运动负责南部的治安，直到合法政府能够控制整个黎巴嫩治安为止，同时每一方有权从事政治、新闻和文化活动。
    据黎巴嫩代表团人士透露，为达成这一双方能够接受的最低限度的协议，叙利亚和伊朗向冲突双方施加了压力。
    伊朗外长韦拉亚提今天在这里对记者表示，希望这一协议能够实现“阿迈勒”与“真主党”之间的全面和解，并停止一切暴力和残杀活动。
