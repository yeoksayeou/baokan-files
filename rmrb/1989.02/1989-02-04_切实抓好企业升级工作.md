Effectively Promote Enterprise Upgrading Work

The "Seventh Five-Year Plan" stipulates that by 1990, 40% of the main industrial products should reach the performance and quality levels of the late 1970s and early 1980s internationally. How can this goal be achieved? "Improve management, upgrade standards" is a proven method.

If enterprise rectification has played a role in strengthening enterprise management by comparing the present with the past, then when comparing enterprise product quality and performance with international standards, there are still many problems. Over the past two years, China has extensively and universally formulated quality and consumption standards for major industrial products according to international standards, which has greatly promoted the overall improvement of enterprise quality.

It must be admitted that in the process of enterprise upgrading, some industries have set low and overly complicated upgrading standards, and some upgrading approval work has the phenomenon of "hitching a ride," affecting the quality of enterprise upgrading. These issues should be improved in future work. Some units and enterprises have not focused on improving management levels but have sought "shortcuts" by entertaining guests, giving gifts, and building relationships, fostering unhealthy practices. This must be resolutely stopped.

Enterprise upgrading is a practical task that brooks no deception. It requires all parties to work diligently to improve work, step by step to enhance enterprise quality, to avoid formalism, and to truly achieve results.

### 切实抓好企业升级工作

　　切实抓好企业升级工作
    “七五”计划要求，到１９９０年要有４０％的主要工业产品性能、质量达到国际７０年代末、８０年代初的水平。通过什么途径实现这一目标呢？“抓管理，上等级”是行之有效的办法。
    如果说企业整顿对于加强企业管理起过作用的话，那它主要是指企业的现在和过去相比已有了进步。而拿企业产品质量、性能同国际水平作横向比较，问题仍然不少。两年多来，我国大规模地、普遍地按照国际标准制订工业主导产品的质量标准和物耗标准，对于全面提高企业的素质，具有很大的促进作用。
    毋庸讳言，在开展企业升级工作中，有的行业制订的升级标准偏低，而且过于繁琐，有的升级审定工作存在“搭车”现象，影响了企业升级的质量。这些，应在今后的工作中努力改进。也有的单位和企业，没有在提高管理水平上下功夫，而是找“捷径”，请客送礼拉关系，搞不正之风。这也是要坚决制止的。
    企业升级是一项实实在在的工作，来不得半点虚假，必须靠各方面扎扎实实地改进工作，一步一个脚印地提高企业素质，才能避免形式主义，真正抓出实效。
