The low oxygen physiology laboratory in Shanghai has recently been completed and, after passing an expert evaluation, will soon be open to both Chinese and foreign scientists.

Oxygen is the foundation of life activities, and insufficient oxygen supply can cause discomfort in the human body. The laboratory, built at the Shanghai Institute of Physiology, will conduct comprehensive research on low oxygen physiology from the perspectives of the whole body, functional systems, organs, cells, and molecules. The goal is to understand the body's reactions, adjustments, adaptations, and tolerance to insufficient oxygen supply. This will help elucidate the dynamic changes in various central mediators such as neuropeptides under low oxygen conditions and the relationship between cardiac pump reserve capacity and adaptation under low oxygen conditions.

Currently, the laboratory is equipped with modern facilities such as an automatic control large-scale low-pressure chamber, gas mixing pump, and cardiac distance meter. A scholarly committee consisting of 13 associate and deputy researchers has also been established. According to the relevant regulations, researchers from other institutions who come to work in this laboratory can become members of the Chinese Academy of Sciences' open research laboratory. They can participate in domestic and international academic activities and share the research results completed here with both parties.

　　低氧生理实验室在沪建成
    即将对中外科学家开放
    新华社上海２月１０日电（记者张学全）中国科学院低氧生理实验室最近在上海建成，通过专家评审，即将对中外开放。
    氧是生命活动的基础，供氧不足将引起人体的不适。建在上海生理研究所的低氧生理实验室，将从整体、功能系统、器官、细胞和分子的不同层次入手，对低氧生理开展综合研究，了解供氧不足时人体的反应、调节、适应和耐受情况，以摸清低氧下神经肽等各类中枢介质的动态变化、低氧下心泵储备能力与适应的关系。
    目前，该实验室备有自动控制的大型低压舱、气体混合泵、心肌测距仪等现代化设备；并成立了由１３名正、副研究员组成的学术委员会。有关规定说：凡外单位来这个实验室工作的科研工作者，可作为中科院开放研究实验室成员，参加国内外有关学术活动，在这里完成的研究成果为双方共有。
