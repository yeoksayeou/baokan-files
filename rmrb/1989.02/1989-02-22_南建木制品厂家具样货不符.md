In September 1988, I purchased a set of combined furniture from a furniture exhibition hall in Beijing, produced by the Beijing Nan Jian Wood Products Factory, and paid a deposit of 300 yuan. On December 25, I went to the factory to pick up the goods. However, the goods I picked up were completely different from the samples displayed in the exhibition hall. This set of furniture not only had an unattractive design and poor craftsmanship, but also wobbled when moved. When I asked the person in charge of the delivery at the factory, he said, “Our factory’s furniture is like this. If you don’t want it, you can return it!”

I had no choice but to process the return. They first said that a 4% handling fee would be deducted from the deposit of 300 yuan. Later, they changed their minds and proposed to deduct 4% of the furniture's selling price of 1779 yuan as the handling fee. After much argument, we finally settled the matter by paying 70 yuan.

　　南建木制品厂家具样货不符
    １９８８年９月，我在北京的一家家具展销馆订购了一套北京南建木制品厂生产的组合家具，并预付了３００元货款。１２月２５日，我去厂里提货。然而，我提的货和展销馆陈列的样品，简直判若两样。这套家具不仅样式不美，工艺粗糙，而且来回晃动。问到这家厂办理提货手续的同志，他说：“我们厂的家具就是这样，不愿要就退货！”
    我只好办理退货手续。他们先说按预付款３００元的４％作为手续费。后来，他们又改口提出按家具销售价格１７７９元的４％作为手续费。我们费了不少口舌，最后还是交了７０元才算了结此事。
