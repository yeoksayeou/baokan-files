Pakistan reiterated that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes and expressed hope that Indian leaders would dispel their doubts.

The Xinhua News Agency reported from Islamabad on February 5 that the Pakistani Foreign Ministry spokesman expressed surprise and concern over Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's recent remarks on Pakistan's nuclear program.

According to reports, Rajiv Gandhi said on February 3 that West Germany had provided Pakistan with nuclear technology and tritium, which could increase the destructive power of atomic bombs by 4 to 10 times.

The spokesman regretted that the Indian leader made such remarks at this time.

He said that after Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and Rajiv Gandhi held bilateral talks in December last year, there was a good starting point for easing tensions and normalizing relations between the two countries. The two countries signed an agreement not to attack each other's nuclear facilities.

He said that Pakistan had neither imported any nuclear materials nor nuclear technology from West Germany.

The spokesman said that India's groundless accusations could only damage the atmosphere of trust that Pakistan is trying to build between the two countries.

The spokesman hoped that Indian leaders would dispel their doubts about Pakistan's nuclear program, which is solely for peaceful purposes.

### 巴基斯坦重申核计划用于和平目的　希望印度领导人解除怀疑

　　巴基斯坦重申核计划用于和平目的
　　希望印度领导人解除怀疑
    新华社伊斯兰堡２月５日电  巴基斯坦外交部发言人昨天晚上对印度总理拉·甘地最近就巴基斯坦核计划问题发表的讲话表示惊讶和关切。
    据报道，拉·甘地于２月３日说，联邦德国向巴基斯坦提供了核技术和氚，这种技术和氚能使原子弹的威力增加４至１０倍。
    发言人对印度领导人这个时候发表这种讲话表示遗憾。
    他说，在去年１２月巴基斯坦总理贝·布托同拉·甘地举行了双边会谈后，两国间出现了缓和紧张局势和实现关系正常化的良好起点。两国签署了互不攻击对方核设施的协议。
    他说，巴基斯坦从联邦德国既未进口任何核原料，也未进口核技术。
    发言人说，印度的这种毫无根据的指责只能损坏巴基斯坦努力寻求在两国间建立的信任气氛。
    发言人希望印度领导人消除对只用于和平目的的巴基斯坦核计划的怀疑。
