Erjigen drove his sheep to a place with lush grass, left two big yellow dogs to watch over them, and then rode his horse around. He saw hares chasing hares, saw yellow sheep chasing yellow sheep. Tired, he lay down on a sand dune, leaned against a small elm tree, and took out a wine gourd from the wide folds of his Mongolian robe…

When he heard the puttering sound of a motorcycle, he knew it was his youngest son, Deliger, returning home. He squinted his eyes and asked, “Who’s here?”

“The county committee secretary, Ba.”

“Good! You go catch a sheep and tie it to the back of the motorcycle.”

The young man dashed into the flock of sheep.

Erjigen had just sat cross-legged with his guest to enjoy some milk tea when his youngest son had already thrown a sheep with tied legs onto the grass in front of the tent.

The host and guest slowly sipped their milk tea, their conversation flowing smoothly. Deliger began to slaughter the sheep. He lightly cut the Mongolian knife across the sheep’s breast, quickly reached in, grabbed, pulled, and tossed a fresh red sheep’s heart into the grass.

Nomads never let the blood out when slaughtering sheep; the meat is the most tender and fresh this way.

Nomads are hospitable; every family has wine. Wine made from milk, sealed for five or six years, is fragrant and mellow! Serving “hand-pulled mutton” to guests is an old custom of Mongolian herders.

Secretary Ba is a frequent guest. Erjigen, this advanced model, was promoted by him.

Old Erjigen became wealthy through his own hard work. Every autumn, the whole family goes out to cut grass. They cut during the day and transport it at night, working for half a month. The courtyard of the “settlement point” is filled with haystacks like golden mountains. Cattle and sheep are most afraid of heavy snow. Last year, this place experienced an unprecedented “white disaster,” and half of other people’s cattle and sheep froze or starved to death, but his family was safe.

The water of the Xilin River upstream flows like a blue ribbon, winding through the meadows full of colorful flowers. Erjigen uses this as his summer pasture. Two Mongolian tents are pitched not far from the riverbank, one for living and one for cooking.

I specially visited the cooking tent: in the middle is the stove, with a thick chimney pipe extending out of the skylight. By the door are three large jars, filled with fresh milk and sour milk. Next to the stove are cabinets and wine racks, all filled with wine. Outside the door, a cart is covered with milk tofu, like yellowish-brown bricks, each weighing about five or six pounds. Beside it is a rope with strings of mushrooms hanging. A large black and white dog sleeps in the shade under the cart.

I watched intently, and then heard Old Erjigen’s call to “take a seat,” suddenly smelling the enticing aroma of meat.

The small table is red and shiny, and the glasses of “grassland white wine” reflect the dusty figures.

Old Erjigen’s eldest daughter, Wuyun, placed a plate of thinly sliced sheep’s heart and a plate of wild garlic flowers at the two corners of the table, and then brought out whole pieces of mutton, with a few shiny Mongolian knives stuck in them.

Everyone pulled and ate, their hands greasy.

“Cheers! Bottoms up for the first cup!”

The host took the lead and drank, and Secretary Ba also tilted his head back. I was a bit hesitant: “Let’s drink it in two rounds.”

“Nonsense! Drinking in two rounds means we’re not family.”

I reluctantly drank a large mouthful and quickly used the knife to pull a piece of fat meat.

The white wine was fragrant and delicious, and even after three rounds, I didn’t feel dizzy. Maybe it was because my mood was too good today.

At this moment, there was a commotion outside the door. Old Erjigen’s second son, Batir, returned from the 30-mile away county supply store, with two boxes of Linxi beer on the back seat of the motorcycle. Old Erjigen and Secretary Ba both praised this beer to me, saying it was on par with Qingdao beer because the brewery was built with the help of Qingdao beer factory engineers, using the same technology. I asked, “Don’t you drink Pingan beer?” Secretary Ba said, “It’s hard to get!”

In the past, herders preferred milk wine and white wine, but now they prefer beer! Times have changed, and beer is popular.

After two cups, I felt dizzy. Erjigen insisted on not letting me stop, so he called his youngest daughter, Sharin, to come and toast. She held the wine cup high above her head while singing the “Toast Song”:

	Far away neighbor, you must drink a cup of wine,
	Far away guest, you must drink a cup of wine,
	Friends gather together, celebrating a bumper harvest in animal husbandry,
	Everyone come and drink this cup of happy wine.

	“Drink! Since you’ve come to the grasslands, you must have the courage of a grasslander!”

	I couldn’t drink anymore, feeling the blood rush to my head, my body weak, and quickly moved to lean against the bedding pile. They say, “When drunk, the heart is clear.” The host was happy because I was drunk, which meant I was sincere and a good friend.

	Old Erjigen and Secretary Ba continued to raise their cups frequently.

	When it was dark, Secretary Ba also fell down, but Erjigen was still at the tent door, calling his two sons to go behind the hill to check on the horse and cattle herds: “Ride slowly, just ride the motorcycle, go quickly and come back quickly!”

	His dark face was full of wrinkles, traces left by the wind and rain of the grasslands. Of course, there were also tears.

	His heart is a vast grassland. He said, he always felt that behind the sheep herd, there was a cloud of peach blossoms rising endlessly.

　　在敖日根家里作客
    桑原
    敖日根将羊赶到水草肥美的地方，让两条大黄狗看着，自己骑马四处游逛去了。他瞅见野兔追野兔，瞧见黄羊追黄羊，累了，就躺在金沙包子上，背倚小沙榆，从宽大的蒙古袍襟内掏出一个酒葫芦……
    当他听到突突突的摩托声响，就知道是小儿子德力格尔回家了，于是眯起眼睛：“谁来了？”
    “旗委巴书记。”
    “好！你快去抓一只羊捆在嘉陵后座上。”
    小伙子一个箭步蹿进骚动的羊群。
    敖日根刚刚盘腿和客人共进奶茶，小儿子已将一只捆住腿的绵羊扔到包门前的草地上。
    主客慢慢品着奶茶，聊兴正浓，德力格尔宰羊了。只见他将蒙古刀轻轻在羊脯子上一划，立即伸进手去，使劲一掐，一甩，一颗鲜红的羊心滚落草丛。
    牧人宰羊从不放血，这样的肉最嫩最鲜。
    牧人是好客的，他们家家都有酒，密封了五六年的奶酒可香醇哩！拿“手抓羊肉”招待客人是蒙古牧人的老规矩。
    巴书记乃常客。敖日根这个先进典型就是他抓的。
    老敖致富全靠一双手，每年秋天全家出动去打草，白天割倒晚上运，一忙就是半月。“定居点”的院里院外全成草垛金山了。牛羊最怕大雪。去年这儿发生罕见的“白灾”，别人的牛羊冻死饿死大半，他家却平安无事。
    锡林河上游的河水像蓝色的飘带，在开满五彩鲜花的草甸上飘来飘去。敖日根以此作夏牧场，两顶蒙古包扎在河边不远处，一顶住人，一顶升火做饭。
    我特意参观做饭的毡包：中间是锅台，上有一柱粗大的炉筒伸出天窗。门边有三口大缸，分别盛满鲜奶和酸奶。锅台边的碗柜和酒橱，放的全是酒，门外的勒勒车上晾满了奶豆腐，像米黄色的城砖，每块约有五六斤重。旁边系一根绳，缀挂着蘑菇串儿。一条灰大的黑花狗在车下的荫凉处睡觉。
    我瞅得入神，那边传来老敖“入座”的喊声，蓦然闻到诱人的肉香。
    小方桌红亮红亮，玻璃杯内的“草原白酒”照着风尘仆仆的影子。
    老敖的大女儿乌云将一盘切得很薄的羊心和一盘野韭菜花放在桌的两角，就把整块整块的羊肉也端了上来，肉上插着几把闪闪发光的蒙古刀。
    大家边拉边吃，两手油乎乎的。
    “干！第一杯都干！”
    主人带头先饮，巴书记脖子也一仰。我有点胆怯：“分两次吧。”
    “哪里话！分两次就不是一家人了。”
    我勉为其难，也咕咚了一大口，赶紧用刀拉了一块肥肉。
    白酒清香可口，连干三杯也未上头。许是我今日心情忒佳。
    这时，门外一阵骚动，老敖的二儿子巴特尔从３０里外的苏木（乡）供销社回来了，车后座驮着两箱林西啤酒。老敖和巴书记都对我夸赞这啤酒。说和青岛啤酒不相上下，因为这酒厂就是青岛啤酒厂工程师帮助兴建起来的，一样的工艺。我问：“你们不喝宣化啤酒么？”巴书记说：“不好弄呀！”
    过去牧人时兴奶酒、白酒，现在则恭奉啤酒！时代变了，啤酒便吃香。
    两杯过后，我觉得头晕。敖日根说什么也不让住杯，便叫小女儿沙仁来敬酒。她一边将酒杯高举过头，一边唱着《祝酒歌》：
    远方来的邻居你要喝杯酒
    远方来的客人你要喝杯酒
    亲朋欢聚一堂，共庆牧业大丰收
    大家都来共饮这杯幸福酒
    “喝！既然到了草原，就要有草原人的海量嘛！”
    我再也喝不下去了，只觉得血往上涌，浑身发软，赶快挪身靠在被垛上。俗话说，酒醉心上明。主人却高兴了，因为我醉了，就证明我忒实在，够朋友。
    老敖与巴书记仍在频频举杯。
    天黑时，巴书记也倒下了，敖日根却在包房门口向草野使劲呼唤他的两个儿子，命他俩到敖包后面看看马群和牛群：“骑马慢，就骑嘉陵，快去快回！”
    黧黑的脸上尽是皱纹，这是草原风雨留下的痕迹啊。那里面，当然也有泪。
    他的心，是一片茫茫的草原。他说，他总感到羊群的背后，有一片桃花似的云霞不断地升腾。
