Title: The Pros and Cons of Renting Out Counter Spaces

Currently, in our city, there are over 3,000 counter spaces in state-owned and collective stores rented out to individual entrepreneurs. In bustling streets, both the fronts and insides of many stores are almost entirely occupied by rented counter spaces. What kind of benefits does this practice of renting out counter spaces bring?

Obviously, the lessors gain substantial rental income without much effort. For instance, the Lanzhou Department Store rents out over 300 counter spaces, earning 2 million yuan in rent annually, which is equivalent to 71.4% of the store's annual operating profit. The lessees, however, will not willingly let the lessors reap all the benefits; they often pass on the high rent to consumers. Therefore, the prices of goods sold in rented counter spaces are generally higher than those in state-owned counters. Taking the Lanzhou Department Store as an example, a woolen coat produced by the Lanzhou Second Woolen Mill sells for 196 yuan in the state-owned counter, while just a few steps away in an individually operated rented counter, it sells for 227 yuan. A pure wool blanket produced by the same factory sells for 194 yuan on the third floor's state-owned counter, but for 210 yuan on the fourth floor's rented counter. Some goods made entirely of synthetic fibers are falsely advertised as "pure wool" and "thick premium quality" by the individual sellers, and unsuspecting consumers may easily fall for these tricks.

Our country's commodity economy is not yet fully developed, and it is necessary to open up more channels for business operations and encourage competition. However, because the lessors only seek profits and neglect management, allowing self-spontaneous operations, state-owned stores and individual operations are mixed together, giving unscrupulous operators opportunities to exploit, thereby damaging the reputation of state-owned stores. Relevant departments and units renting out counter spaces should still prioritize the interests of consumers and cherish commercial credibility, and conduct a cleanup and rectification of rented counter spaces.

### 出租柜台的利与弊

　　出租柜台的利与弊
    目前，我市国营、集体商店出租给个体户经营的柜台达３０００处之多，闹市街道的一些店前店内，基本上被出租柜台所占领。这种出租柜台的做法究竟给谁带来了利益？
    显然，出租方毫不费力，可获得可观的租金。如兰州百货大楼，出租柜台３００多个，一年之内可获租金２００万元，相当于兰州百货大楼全年实现营业利润的７１．４％。而承租方也不会甘愿只让利给出租方，他们往往把高租金转嫁于消费者身上。因此，出租柜台商品的价格一般高于国营柜台。仍以兰州百货大楼为例，同是兰州第二毛纺厂生产的拷花呢大衣，国营售价１９６元一件，而相隔几步的个体经营柜台竟卖２２７元；同一厂家生产的天鹅牌纯毛毯，３楼国营柜台上卖１９４元，而４楼个体柜台卖２１０元；有的纯属化纤织物，个体柜台的一些叫卖者则大喊“纯毛料子”，“加厚优品”，消费者稍不留意，就要上当。
    我国的商品经济尚不发达，确需广开经营渠道鼓励竞争，但因出租方只图获利，忽视管理，任其自发经营，使国营商店与个体经营混在一起，让一些不法经营者钻了空子，从而损害了国营商店的信誉。有关部门和出租柜台的单位，还是应当维护消费者的利益，珍惜商业信誉，对出租柜台进行清理整顿。
