The capital of Qinghai Province, Xining, is home to tens of thousands of migrants from Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Henan, Gansu, and other provinces. Many of these migrants have come to escape local family planning regulations. Locals refer to them as the "over-birth guerrilla teams."

A recent joint investigation by the Xining Public Security Bureau and the Family Planning Bureau into the living conditions and childbirth situations of these migrants revealed that nearly 10,000 couples in this "over-birth guerrilla team" have severely disrupted Xining's family planning efforts. In a sample survey of 742 migrant households in four street offices in the western part of the city, including Gucheng Tai, there were 536 married women of childbearing age. Among them, 141 had one child, 131 had two, 64 had three, 76 had four or more, with the highest number being eight children. The over-birth rate was as high as 65.69%.

In the western part of the city, on Mojia Road, there is a furniture shop called Xinghai. Both the husband and wife are from Dongyang County, Zhejiang. They already have three children, and family planning in their hometown is strictly enforced. To have more children, they moved to Xining several years ago. In the central part of the city, on Guanmen Street, there is a barbershop run by outsiders. The couple already has three daughters and wants a son. Recently, the wife became pregnant again. Street officials have repeatedly urged them to practice family planning, but they said, "We'll pay the fine. Whatever the fine is, we'll pay it, as long as we can have a healthy son."

In the past, areas like the northern part of the city, the foot of the Tuluo Mountain, and both sides of the railway bridge in the western part of the city were barren. Now, they have become the "strongholds" of migrant settlements, turning into unregulated "golden corners." The phenomenon of over-birth is even more prevalent in these areas.

During the investigation, the Xining Family Planning Bureau discovered four households with eight children each, all living in these areas. There are also migrants who had undergone sterilization surgeries in their hometowns but secretly sought out quack doctors to reverse the procedures. As a result, not only did the surgeries fail, but they also nearly lost their lives.

Although Xining issued the "Temporary Measures for the Management of Family Planning for Floating Population" in 1987, the implementation has been far from satisfactory.

Many units, hotels, and landlords that accommodate migrants often turn a blind eye to over-birth situations. Economic penalties for over-birth have also largely gone unenforced.

In the corners of Xining, the "over-birth guerrilla teams" are active, but what measures will we take to address this blind spot in family planning?

### 外来户生育无人管　钻空子最多生八胎  近万对“超生游击队”流入西宁

　　外来户生育无人管　钻空子最多生八胎    
    近万对“超生游击队”流入西宁
    新华社西宁２月１８日电  （记者王宏伟）青海省会西宁市，寄居着数万名来自浙江、江苏、河南、甘肃等地的“外来户”，他们当中，有许多是为逃避当地计划生育管理而来的。当地群众称他们是“超生游击队”。
    西宁市公安局和计划生育局最近对寄住的外来人员及其生育情况的调查表明，这支由近万对育龄夫妇组成的“超生游击队”，对西宁市的计划生育工作造成了严重的干扰。城西区古城台等４个街道办事处抽查７４２户外来人员，其中已婚育龄妇女５３６人，生育１胎的１４１人，２胎１３１人，３胎６４人，４胎以上７６人，最多的生８胎，超生率高达６５．６９％。
    城西区莫家路有一个兴海家具铺，男女主人都是浙江东阳县人，他们已经有了３个孩子，家乡对计划生育抓得非常紧，为了多生，他们于数年前来到了西宁。城中区观门街有个外乡人开的理发店，夫妇俩已有３个女儿，还想再生个儿子，不久前妻子又怀孕了，街道干部多次动员他们实行计划生育，而他们说，超生罚款好了，罚多少给多少，只要能生个胖儿子就行。
    原来是一片荒芜的城北土楼山脚、城西铁路小桥两侧等地，如今已是外来人员聚居的“大本营”，成为无人管的“金角银边”，这里超生现象更是普遍。
    西宁市计划生育局在抽查中发现的生育８胎的４个超生大户，都居住在这些地方。还有在家乡时已做了绝育手术的外来人员，私下请江湖医生做输卵管接通手术，结果手术没成功还差点赔上了性命。
    西宁市虽然在１９８７年颁布了《流动人口计划生育管理暂行办法》，但执行情况却不能令人满意。
    许多接纳外来人员的单位、旅店、房主对外来人员超计划生育的现象，大多不闻不问，对超生者的经济处罚也基本上未能兑现。
    西宁的角落，“超生游击队”在行动，而我们对这个计划生育的死角将采取什么对策呢？
