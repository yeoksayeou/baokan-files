Several Irrational Combinations

Currently, some comrades have a vague understanding of the scientific connotations of labor combinations, leading to several irrational combinations in practice. These phenomena deserve attention:

Kin-based combinations. Grouping family members and relatives together to form a "family empire" is fundamentally at odds with reform. This is purely a product of feudal ideology.

Brotherhood combinations. Those involved in these combinations are often friends who get along well, merely because of similar personalities or temporary compatibility. Such combinations lack a solid work foundation. Their biggest weakness is that they can easily lead to internal strife or even disintegration once there are disagreements over interests.

Gentlemanly combinations. Grouping together submissive, honest, and easy-to-lead "sheep-like" individuals who do not cause trouble. While there may be no conflicts or arguments, management classics warn us, "If there is no dissatisfaction, there is no progress."

Low-capability combinations. The idea behind these combinations is "Wudalang's shop, no tall people welcome." The leaders often have narrow-minded thoughts, envy talent, and reject capable and innovative individuals. The result is mediocrity in charge, harming the enterprise.

Even worse, some places have seen labor combinations determining "survival of the fittest" based on the amount of gifts given. This is a blatant desecration of science.

### 几种不合理的组合

　　几种不合理的组合
    时下，有些同志对劳动组合科学的内涵认识不清，导致在实践中出现了几种不合理的因素组合，这些现象值得警惕：
    亲缘组合。把家庭成员、亲戚朋友组合在一起形成“家天下”，这种组合与改革从根本上背道而驰，纯粹是封建观念的产物。
    哥们义气组合。参加组合的多为私交不错的朋友，只凭性格相近或一时说得来，根本没有牢固的工作基础。这样的组合最大的弱点就是一旦出现利益上的分歧便会引起内哄，甚至四分五裂。
    谦谦君子组合。把听话、老实、好领导、拨一拨动一动的“绵羊”式人物组合在一起，没有矛盾，没有争论。然而管理学经典著作曾告诫我们，“如果没有不满，也就没有上进。”
    低能组合。“武大郎开店，高人不要”是这种组合的思想基础。牵头人大多思想狭隘，妒贤嫉能，有能力，敢创新的人他统统不要，结果是庸人掌权，企业受害。
    更有甚者，有的地方竟然出现劳动组合以送礼多少来确定“优胜劣汰”，这简直就是对科学的亵渎了。
