The panic buying has not yet started, but management measures are already in place. Jiangsu is taking steps to prevent a repeat of the "silkworm cocoon war."

According to the New China News Agency in Nanjing on February 27 (reporter Hua Huiyi), the Jiangsu Silk Corporation has recently taken measures to further strengthen the macro-management of cocoon, silk, and textile production and operations to prevent a repeat of the "silkworm cocoon war" this year.

Jiangsu Province's production and export of cocoons, silk, and textiles rank among the top in the country, and last year it was also the most severely affected by the "silkworm cocoon war."

According to incomplete statistics, due to the loss of control over cocoon and silk prices last year, the state and enterprises suffered a loss of 190 million yuan. The loss of price control also led to the loss of control over the allocation of raw materials, making it impossible to guarantee normal export sources, and the export credibility of silk textiles was damaged.

According to analysis, the resources of cocoons, silk, and textiles will still be relatively tight this year, and there is a possibility of a panic buying spree after the spring cocoons are on the market. Therefore, the Jiangsu Silk Corporation has, since the beginning of this year, formulated specific measures for the macro-management of cocoon and silk production and operations based on the actual situation in Jiangsu, to prevent the occurrence of a new "silkworm cocoon war."

　　抢购风潮未起　管理措施先出
    江苏防止“蚕茧大战”重演
    据新华社南京２月２７日电  （记者华惠毅）江苏省丝绸总公司最近采取措施，进一步加强茧丝绸生产和经营的宏观管理，以防止今年再发生“蚕茧大战”。
    江苏省茧丝绸的产量和出口量在全国名列前茅，去年受“蚕茧大战”的影响也最为严重。
    据不完全统计，去年由于茧丝价失控，使国家和企业损失了１．９亿元。价格失控还导致原料调拨失控，正常的出口货源无法保证，丝绸出口信誉受到损害。
    据分析，今年茧丝绸资源仍然比较紧张，春茧上市后还有可能出现抢购风潮。为此，江苏省丝绸总公司从今年一开始，从江苏的实际出发，制订了加强茧丝生产和经营宏观管理的具体措施，以防止发生新的“蚕茧大战”。
