In the past, the forest area consumed a large amount of wood for heating every year. Starting from 1985, the Great Khingan Mountains Forest Area in Inner Mongolia focused on saving firewood. All units that could use coal were mandated to switch to coal, and centralized heating was implemented. This measure saves 14 million cubic meters of firewood and heating materials annually. Previously, even for heating, birch poles were not preferred. Now, they are processed into wooden products such as clothes hangers and sold to distant places.

    ▲内蒙古大兴安岭林区四年节省烧材５００万立方米  过去，林区每年烧火耗用大量木材。从１９８５年开始，内蒙古大兴安岭林区抓了节约烧火木材工作，凡是能烧煤的一律改烧煤，并实行集中供暖。这样一年可节省烧火、取暖用材１４０多万立方米。过去连烧火也不愿意用的桦木杆，如今用来加工成衣挂等木制品，远销外地。
