Iranian President Ali Khamenei said in a prayer ceremony on February 17 that if the author of "The Satanic Verses," Salman Rushdie, apologizes to Muslims and Ayatollah Khomeini, the people may forgive him.

Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khomeini issued a fatwa on February 14 calling for Rushdie's death and declaring that anyone killed in the attempt to execute Rushdie would be considered a martyr. The Iranian government has offered approximately $6 million as a reward for those who carry out the killing of Rushdie.

Khamenei criticized Britain for siding with Rushdie.

According to reports, Rushdie is currently under the protection of British police.

Our correspondent in London, Chen Te'an, reported on February 18 that Iranian President Khamenei suggested to the British side that if the author of "The Satanic Verses," Salman Rushdie, apologizes to Khomeini and Muslims by saying, "I made a big mistake," he might be forgiven by the Islamic countries and spared from execution.

Some Muslim groups have accused the book of blasphemy against God, and some countries have already banned its publication. However, the book is still being published in Britain.

　　《撒旦的诗篇》在伊朗引起强烈反应
    新华社德黑兰２月１７日电  伊朗总统哈梅内伊１７日在祈祷仪式上发表讲话说，如果《撒旦的诗篇》作者萨曼·拉什迪向穆斯林和霍梅尼谢罪的话，人民可以宽恕他。
    伊朗宗教领袖霍梅尼１４日下令要杀死拉什迪，并说凡为处死拉什迪而遭杀害的人将被认为是烈士。伊朗官方组织愿拿出大约６００万美元，奖赏那些处死拉什迪的人。
    哈梅内伊谴责英国偏袒拉什迪。
    据报道，拉什迪目前已处在英国警察的保护之下。
    本报伦敦２月１８日电　记者陈特安报道：伊朗总统哈梅内伊１７日向英国方面建议，如果《撒旦的诗篇》作者萨曼·拉什迪向霍梅尼和穆斯林道歉说：“我犯了一个大错误”，那就可能得到伊斯兰国家人民的原谅，免予处死。
    一些穆斯林团体曾指责这本书是一本亵渎真主的书，有些国家已宣布禁止出版该书。但该书正在英国出版。
