The three major economic blocs, if they can revitalize through market unification, could help the world escape the crisis of trade protectionism.

During the Great Depression of the 1930s, to mitigate the adverse effects of free international division of labor on domestic employment, bloc economies rapidly developed. Various countries raised tariff barriers against non-member states and strengthened trade protection measures, leading to global unemployment and a vicious cycle of inflation. At that time, the drawbacks of bloc economies outweighed the benefits.

However, the current situation is different. Whether it is the European Community or the United States and Canada, the goal is to enhance economic vitality within the region. Therefore, there is no reason to raise tariff barriers against non-member states. Although an abnormal trade system may exist, by promoting economic growth, it may further expand trade with non-member states.

It can be said that the European Community economic bloc and the North American economic bloc were born through artificial market unification. But the East Asian economic bloc has accelerated its unification through existing open markets and horizontal division of labor, increasing mutual dependence. Moreover, horizontal division of labor is based on the principle of mutual benefit, which greatly promotes the adjustment of economic structures. It is evident that the East Asian economic bloc is naturally formed.

Nowadays, the internationalization of enterprises has become a trend in the world economy, which will lead to a borderless economic system. Even if the bloc economies of the European Community or North America are further strengthened, the interdependence among countries will continue to deepen.

　　区域化对世界经济的影响
    三大经济圈如果通过市场的统一能出现生机的话，世界就能从贸易保护主义的危机中摆脱出来。
    三十年代经济大危机时为了摆脱自由的国际分工给本国的就业带来的不良影响，集团化经济迅速发展。各国采取提高对本集团外的国家关税壁垒和加强贸易保护措施导致了全球性的失业以及通货膨胀的恶性循环。就当时情况而言，集团化经济带来的弊大于利。
    但现在的情况是，无论是欧共体还是美国与加拿大，其目的都是要提高本区域内的经济活力，因而没有理由去提高对区域外的关税壁垒。虽然畸型贸易体系有可能存在，但通过提高经济增长，也许会进一步扩大对本区域外的贸易。
    可以说，欧共体经济圈和北美经济圈是通过人为的市场统一而诞生的。但东亚经济圈是通过现有的开放市场和横向分工提高了相互依存度，从而加快了统一的步伐，况且横向的分工是以互惠为原则的，这大大促进了经济结构的调整，可见东亚的经济圈是自然形成的。
    现在，企业国际化已成为世界经济的发展趋势，这样将会出现无国界化的经济体系。即使欧共体或北美经济圈的集团化进一步加强，世界各国间的相互依存度仍将会不断加深。
