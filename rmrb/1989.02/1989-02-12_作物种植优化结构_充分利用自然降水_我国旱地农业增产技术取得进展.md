	Optimizing Crop Planting Structure to Fully Utilize Natural Rainfall
	Advances in Dryland Agriculture Production Technology in China
	This report by He Huangbiao: The key national science and technology project for dryland agriculture production technology during the "Seventh Five-Year Plan" has made significant progress: experimental areas have taken shape, and economic benefits are remarkable; thematic research has deepened, and a large amount of basic data has been obtained.

	This news was obtained by the reporter from the host unit of the project, the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.

	Dryland agriculture production technology has been implemented in experimental areas such as Fuxin and Kalaqin Left Wing in Liaoning, Tunliu in Shanxi's eastern region, Wuchuan in Inner Mongolia, Heyang and Chengcheng in the Wei River North, and Zhangbei in Hebei. The total area is 45,000 mu, and the demonstration area is 1070,000 mu. After comprehensive treatment experiments, agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry in these regions have developed rapidly, with remarkable effects. Technical personnel started with investigations. After summarizing and proposing six technical reform measures for increased production in the Fuxin experimental area, grain and beans have increased significantly over the past three years. The wool production per sheep has increased by 1.5 kilograms, and the lamb survival rate has increased by 30%. In addition, the region has actively promoted high-yield courtyard economy of 100,000 mu, with a production value of 75 million yuan. In the Kalaqin Left Wing experimental area, corn has been reduced, and the area of cotton and peanuts has been expanded to establish an optimized crop planting structure model. Through the introduction of improved varieties, scientific fertilization, and supplementary irrigation, grain production in the past two years has increased by 60.4% compared to the previous five years. The Tunliu experimental area in Shanxi's eastern region has summarized and promoted the matched cultivation technology of wheat and corn, increasing wheat production by 24.8% and corn production by 13.2%, reaching a historical high. The Zhangbei experimental area has adjusted the planting structure, expanded the area of beans and potatoes, and the total agricultural output value of the region has doubled compared to 1985.

	What is even more gratifying is that after three years of hard work, thematic research is deepening, and a large amount of basic data has been obtained. Participating units in the project have summarized more than ten crop model cultivation technologies, which are being demonstrated and promoted in experimental areas. In the Wei River North dryland, 3786,000 mu of land in six counties have promoted wheat model cultivation, with an average increase of 52.5 kilograms per mu, basically reaching 0.5 kilograms of wheat per millimeter of rainfall. In addition, various places have conducted field experiments on the natural rainfall production potential of winter wheat, spring wheat, corn, and millet, and analyzed the relationship between annual crop yield and rainfall. The results show that different crops have significant differences in rainfall utilization coefficients. Adjusting the sowing period, soaking seeds with calcium chloride, and reducing ineffective evaporation can all improve water utilization efficiency.

　　作物种植优化结构　充分利用自然降水    
    我国旱地农业增产技术取得进展
    本报讯  记者何黄彪报道：列入“七五”国家重点科技项目的旱地农业增产技术已经取得重要进展：实验区初具规模，经济效益十分显著；专题研究深入发展，大量基础数据已经掌握。
    这一消息，是记者从该课题的主持单位中国农业科学院获悉的。
    旱地农业增产技术在辽宁阜新、喀喇沁左翼，晋东南屯留，内蒙古武川，渭北合阳、澄城，河北张北等实验区实施，面积４．５万亩，示范区１０７万亩。经过综合治理试验，这些地区农林牧迅速发展，效果喜人。科技人员从调查入手，在阜新实验区总结提出６项技术改革增产措施后，三年来粮豆大幅度增产，每只羊产毛量增加１．５公斤，羊羔成活率提高３０％。此外，该地区还积极推广高产的庭院经济１０万亩，产值７５００万元。在喀喇沁左翼实验区压缩玉米，扩大棉花、花生面积，建立种植业优化结构模式，并通过引进良种、科学施肥、补充灌溉等技术，使近两年粮食产量较前五年增长６０．４％。晋东南屯留实验区在总结推广小麦、玉米配套栽培技术之后，使小麦增产２４．８％，玉米增产１３．２％，创历史最高水平。张北实验区通过种植结构调整，豆类、马铃薯面积扩大，全区农业总产值比１９８５年成倍增长。
    尤为可喜的是，通过三年的艰苦攻关，专题研究正在深入，取得了大量的基础数据。参加课题攻关的各单位已总结出十多种作物模式化栽培技术，正在实验区示范推广。渭北旱原６个县３７８．６万亩地推广小麦模式栽培，平均每亩增产５２．５公斤，基本达到每毫米降水生产０．５公斤小麦。此外，各地对冬小麦、春小麦、玉米、谷子等作物的自然降水生产潜力进行了田间试验，并研究分析了历年作物产量与降水量关系。结果表明，不同作物降水利用系数有明显差异，调整播期、氯化钙浸种、减少无效蒸发都能提高水分利用率。
