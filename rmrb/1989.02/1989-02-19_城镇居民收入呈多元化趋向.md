According to a typical survey, in 1988, the per capita monthly income of urban residents in China reached 90 yuan, an increase of nearly 25% compared to 1987, and nearly 2.9 times that of 1978. Residents' income not only increased in absolute terms but also showed a trend toward diversification.

Statistics show that while the absolute amount of wage income from state-owned and collective enterprises is increasing, its proportion of total income is decreasing. In 1988, the per capita wage income in Hebei Province was approximately 75 yuan, an increase of 2.3 times compared to 1978. Among these, the standard wage increased by approximately 1.6 times, bonuses increased by nearly 8 times, and various allowances increased by nearly 2.5 times. The proportion of wage income in total income decreased from 97.7% in 1978 to around 85% in 1988.

Cash income from sources other than wages, obtained by workers from their units, is also increasing. In 1988, urban residents received approximately 6 yuan per person per month from these sources, an increase of approximately 7.4 times compared to 1978. The proportion of this income in total income increased from 3.6% in 1978 to 7.0%. Additionally, workers can obtain various subsidies through different channels, accounting for 7% of their income.

A second job has been accepted by the majority. Nationwide, 10% to 20% of workers have engaged in or are currently engaging in a second job. In Guangzhou, this figure is approximately 20%, and second jobs have enriched many families. Income from property, such as savings, loans, investments, and rentals, has also increased.

　　城镇居民收入呈多元化趋向
    据典型调查，１９８８年，我国城镇居民家庭人均月收入达９０元，比１９８７年增长近１／４，比１９７８年增长近２．９倍。居民收入不仅在绝对值上在拉大，而且呈多元化发展的趋向。
    统计表明，全民、集体所有制职工工资性收入的绝对量虽然在增长，但所占收入总数的比重在下降。１９８８年河北省人均工资收入约７５元，比１９７８年净增２．３倍。其中标准工资增长约１．６倍，奖金增长近８倍；各种津贴增长近２．５倍。工资性收入占总收入的比重，由１９７８年的９７．７％下降到１９８８年的８５％左右。
    职工从单位获得的工资外现金收入也在增长，１９８８年，城镇居民每人每月为６元左右，比１９７８年约增长７．４倍。在全部收入中的比重也由１９７８年的３．６％上升到７．０％。此外，职工还可以通过各种渠道，获得占收入７％的各类补贴。
    第二职业已为多数人所接受。全国有１０％—２０％的职工从事过或正在从事第二职业，广州约为２０％，第二职业也使许多家庭富裕起来。职工来自财产性收入如储蓄、借贷、入股、租赁中得到的利息、股息、红利、租金等也有增长。
