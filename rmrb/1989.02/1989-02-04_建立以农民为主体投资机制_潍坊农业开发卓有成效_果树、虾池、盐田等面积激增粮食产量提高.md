	The People's Daily reports: Correspondent Fei Weiwei reports: Since 1984, Shandong Province's Weifang City has formulated various policies to motivate farmers to engage in developmental production, gradually establishing a farmer-led large-scale investment mechanism. Over four years, the city has invested 2.717 billion yuan in agricultural development, with farmers contributing 2.64 billion yuan, accounting for 97% of the total investment. This amount is equivalent to 30.3 times the total agricultural investment from the central government and the province during the same period.

	The Weifang Municipal Committee and Municipal Government have formulated the following policies and measures:

	Strengthening collective accumulation, adhering to the principle of multi-level, multi-industry accumulation, and determining different accumulation forms and rates. The city has allocated 430 million yuan from the income of township enterprises through various forms such as using industrial profits to support agriculture and building agricultural infrastructure.

	Labor commercialization and stock-based labor. Weifang City organizes farmers to invest over 100 million labor days annually in developmental production. The city bundles the mandatory labor days and construction labor days stipulated by the province into a single unit. Those who cannot work can pay in lieu of labor. After completing the required labor days, those who continue to engage in developmental construction are paid based on the completed work or receive stock-based labor, with dividends distributed upon profit generation. Over four years, the accumulated labor investment has amounted to 1.67 billion yuan.

	Through education and strengthened services, the city helps farmers correctly handle the relationship between accumulation and consumption. Over four years, farmers have contributed 540 million yuan from their own income for development.

	Weifang City has initiated a new rural investment mechanism, primarily driven by farmers' labor accumulation, supplemented by farmers' and township enterprises' investments. This has yielded significant results. The area of fruit trees has expanded from 430,000 mu in 1984 to 1 million mu. The city has established 200,000 mu of high-yield shrimp ponds and 19 million mu of salt fields, producing 140,000 tons of shrimp and 21 million tons of raw salt.

	With the substantial investment of funds and labor, the city has strengthened agricultural "hardware," particularly water conservancy projects, providing excellent material conditions. Despite continuous drought and a total area reduction of 1.2 million mu compared to 1984, the city's grain production increased from 3.74 billion kilograms in 1984 to 4.32 billion kilograms in the previous year. In 1988, the city's rural social total output value reached 15.2 billion yuan, and the per capita income of farmers was 640 yuan, representing increases of 147% and 41.3% respectively compared to 1984.

　　建立以农民为主体投资机制
　  潍坊农业开发卓有成效
　  果树、虾池、盐田等面积激增粮食产量提高
    本报讯  记者费伟伟报道：山东省潍坊市从１９８４年以来，制订各项政策调动农民从事开发性生产的积极性，逐步建立起以农民为主体的规模投资机制。四年全市用于农业开发投资达２７．１７亿元，其中农民投资２６．４亿元，占投资总额９７％，相当于同期中央、省对潍坊全部农业投资的３０．３倍。
    潍坊市委、市府制订了这样几条政策和办法：
    强化集体积累，按照多层次、多行业积累的原则，分别确定不同的积累形式和积累率。全市通过以工补农、建农等形式，从乡镇企业收入中拿出４．３亿元投入开发。
    劳务工商品化，实行劳务入股。潍坊市每年组织农民投１亿多个工日从事开发性生产，把省里规定的每个农村劳力每年５个义务工和１５个基建工捆在一起使用，不能出工者可以资顶劳，完成应出工日后继续从事开发性建设的，按完成的工程量付给报酬或实行劳务入股，待有收益时按股分红。四年来累计投工折款１６．７亿元。
    通过加强教育、强化服务等措施帮助农民正确处理积累与消费的关系，四年来共引导农民从自己收入中拿出５．４亿元用于开发。
    潍坊市通过启动这种以农民劳动积累为主，农民投资、乡镇企业投资为辅的新的农村投资机制，取得了明显效果。果树面积由１９８４年的４３万亩扩大到１００万亩。已建成精养虾池２０万亩，盐田１９０万公亩，对虾、原盐产量分别达到１．４万吨和２１０万吨。
    随着资金和劳力的大量投入，为强化农业“硬件”，特别是水利建设的发展，提供了良好物质条件。去年全市粮食生产在持续干旱、总面积比１９８４年减少１２０万亩的情况下，产量由１９８４年的３７．４亿公斤增加到４３．２亿公斤。１９８８年全市农村社会总产值达１５２亿元，农民人均收入６４０元，分别比１９８４年增长１４７％和４１．３％。
