	Known to All and Unknown to All
	In a news item titled “Money Hualiang’s Artistry Unchanged,” I again saw the phrase “known to all.” It states: “(Due to) reasons known to all, Money Hualiang has not appeared on the Peking Opera stage for over a decade.”

	Is it really “known to all”? The teenagers who have grown up over these past ten years, though they occasionally have the fortune to listen to “model operas,” are not as familiar with them as adults were with “Thank You, Mother.” Do they know the reason why Money Hualiang has not appeared on the Peking Opera stage for over a decade? Even more people might know of Hualiang, but do they know that Money Hualiang is Hualiang, and that it was this very Money Hualiang who, during the Cultural Revolution, abandoned the Money surname and changed his name to Hualiang? Is this also “known to all” as mentioned in the article?

	This news item was published in a newspaper distributed overseas. I am skeptical whether overseas Chinese readers are “known to all,” despite the fact that I do not deny that they sometimes have more information about the domestic situation than domestic readers.

	The widespread use of the phrase “known to all” began approximately ten years ago. When someone was posthumously rehabilitated, or when someone was rehabilitated and returned to public life, in eulogies or news reports, it was mentioned that they had been persecuted during the ten years of turmoil, or that they had been wrongly accused in movements prior to the Cultural Revolution. Often, this was summarized with the phrase “due to reasons known to all.”

	At that time, it was indeed “known to all,” perhaps also for the convenience of writing; more deeply, some people say it was to avoid “stimulating” the emotions of the affected individuals and their families, out of what seemed to be a very humane concern; even more deeply, there was obviously an intention to avoid taboos, fearing that phrases like “Cultural Revolution,” “Anti-Rightist Campaign,” “political movements,” and the like would appear too frequently, causing the typesetting room to run out of lead type, so it was glossed over with a light stroke of the pen. All these reasons seem to be valid, but which one is the main reason? That is not “known to all.”

	However, not long after, with the passage of time, “new people emerge,” and in the eyes of younger readers, “known to all” becomes “unknown to all.” The strategy of “diminishing” history indeed works, as new recruits from rural areas in the People’s Liberation Army do not know who Lin Biao is, and in big cities, there are students who do not know Peng Dehuai, let alone Zhou Enlai. To them, the Cultural Revolution is already a thing of the past, not to mention the more distant “Anti-Rightist Campaign,” “Anti-Rightist Elements,” “Anti-Hu Feng,” criticizing Xiao Jun, Liang Shuming, and so on.

	If a child brings a piece of reading material, say, a brief introduction to the writer Wang Meng, and asks what “reasons known to all” means, you can simply explain that he was labeled a rightist for 21 years and was forced to stop writing, and so on. But if this child, thinking they understand everything, also uses this to understand the “reasons known to all” for why Money Hualiang has not appeared on the Peking Opera stage for over a decade, wouldn’t that completely confuse the different experiences of two very different cultural officials from different periods?

	Why was the news item written this way? I do not know if it is “known to all,” but at least I am “unknowing of the unknown.”

	Using this ambiguous language, due to “reasons known to all,” Wang Li, a former member of the Central Cultural Revolution Group, who had not appeared on the “stage” for twenty years, recently appeared in a Shanghai newspaper with nearly a full-page article titled “Answers to Questions from Visitors While Ill.” Although the Central Cultural Revolution Group was called a small group, its leader was Chen Boda, its deputy leader was Jiang Qing, and its consultant was Kang Sheng, all of whom were powerful figures, and Wang Li’s power, fame, and influence at that time were far beyond what the actor Money Hualiang could compare to.

	Therefore, Wang Li’s appearance is more attention-grabbing than Money’s appearance to those who have “experienced the sea.” The tip of the iceberg emerging from the sea is naturally only a part of the iceberg. Recently, reading newspapers and watching television, I have not just once felt the haunting shadows of the Cultural Revolution, flickering and coming back. It seems that it is not due to an illusion or over-sensitivity. What all this means is temporarily perhaps still “unknown to all,” but it will eventually become “known to all.”

### 众所周知与众所不知

　　众所周知与众所不知
    在一则《钱浩梁功力不减当年》的新闻里，又见到“众所周知”四个字，曰：“（由于）众所周知的原因，钱浩梁十多年没在京剧舞台上亮相了。”
    果然“众所周知”吗？这十几年成长起来的青少年，虽然间或有一聆“样板戏”之幸，但不如成年人曾对“谢谢妈”那么耳熟能详，他们对“钱浩梁十多年没在京剧舞台上亮相”的原因也能“周知”吗？他们以至更多的人也许知道浩亮其人，但对钱浩梁即浩亮，而正是这个钱浩梁为什么在“文革”中放弃钱姓、改名浩亮的经过，也是文中所说的“众所周知”吗？
    这则新闻刊登在一份向海外发行的报纸上，我颇怀疑，海外华文读者是不是“众所周知”，尽管我不否认他们对国内的情形有时比国内读者消息灵通。
    查“众所周知”四个字的大行其时，大约始于十年前，有人死后昭雪，有人平反复出，在悼念文章或新闻报道中，提到他们在十年动乱中遭到打击迫害，或在早于“文革”之前的历次运动中陷身冤假错案，往往一言以蔽之，叫作“由于众所周知的原因”。
    在当时，确是“众所周知”，也许还为了行文简便；更深一层，据有些人说是怕“刺激”当事人及其家属的“感情”，出于似乎挺够人道主义的关怀备至；再深一层，则显然有避讳之意，怕“文革”、“反右”、“政治运动”一类字眼出现频繁，排字房里铅字不够用，所以轻轻一笔带过吧。凡此种种理由，好像全都成立，哪个为主，就非“众所周知”矣。
    不过，没有多久，随着时序流转，“新人辈出”，在更年轻的读者那里，“众所周知”就变成“众所不知”。“淡化”历史果然奏效，解放军从农村入伍的新兵里有不知林彪为何许人的，大城市的小学生里不知道彭德怀甚至不知道周恩来的也不乏其人。对于他们，“文革”已成隔世，不必说更遥远的“反右倾”、“反右派”、“反胡风”、批萧军、梁漱溟了。
    假如有一位小朋友拿来一份读物，比方作家王蒙的简介吧，问什么叫“众所周知的原因”，你可以简单解释说，他有２１年被划为右派，被迫搁笔云云。可这位小朋友一旦自以为举一反三，也这样去理解“钱浩梁十多年没在京剧舞台上亮相了”的“众所周知的原因”，那不就完全混淆了不同时期的两位素质迥异的文化部首长的不同的际遇了吗？
    那则新闻为什么要这样写，不知是不是“众所周知”，反正至少我是“不知为不知”的。
    套用一下这个模胡语言，由于“众所周知的原因”，二十年“没在……舞台上亮相”的前中央文革小组成员王力，最近也在上海一家报纸上以近整版篇幅的《病中答客问》亮相了。“中央文革”虽称小组，但那组长是陈伯达，副组长是江青，顾问是康生，个个炙手可热，而王力赫赫一时的权力、声名和影响，也远非出身演员的浩亮即钱浩梁所能相提并论的。
    因此，王力的亮相比起钱某的亮相，更加引起“曾经沧海”的人们的注意。海上露出的冰山，自然只是冰山的一部分。最近读报纸，看电视，不止一次感到“文革”的梦魇鬼影憧憧，摇曳而来，看来并不是由于错觉或神经过敏。这一切意味着什么，暂时也许还是“众所不知”，但终究会成为“众所周知”的。
