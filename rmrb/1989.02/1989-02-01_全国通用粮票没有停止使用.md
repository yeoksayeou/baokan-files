Readers from Guangxi, Hunan, and other places have written to inquire about the use of nationwide usable grain tickets. We have asked the Grain Procurement and Marketing Bureau of the Ministry of Commerce to provide the following answers:

Q: What is the function of nationwide usable grain tickets?
A: Nationwide usable grain tickets are vouchers for purchasing grain and grain products. They are used by people who move across provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the Central Government). When these people are on business trips, traveling, visiting relatives, working on construction projects, or seeking medical treatment, they can use nationwide usable grain tickets to eat out or, according to local regulations, purchase grain and grain products.

Q: Are nationwide usable grain tickets to be discontinued?
A: Nationwide usable grain tickets have not been discontinued and are still in circulation as before. Some places have temporarily stopped the use of nationwide usable grain tickets, which is a unilateral regulation by individual places and should be corrected.

Q: Which types of grain can be purchased with nationwide usable grain tickets?
A: When purchasing grain with nationwide usable grain tickets, the types of grain supplied are determined by the local grain departments according to the supply ratio. For example, when people use nationwide usable grain tickets to purchase grain in Beijing, the supply ratio is 55% flour, 20% rice, and 25% coarse grains.

Q: Is there a limit on the quantity of grain that can be purchased with nationwide usable grain tickets?
A: The food industry and collective catering units can purchase grain with nationwide usable grain tickets without quantity restrictions. Urban and rural residents can also purchase grain with nationwide usable grain tickets as long as the quantity is not large and the source is legitimate. Legitimate sources refer to having relatives or friends from outside.

To prevent illegal activities such as buying and selling nationwide usable grain tickets and to ensure a reasonable supply of grain, some places require necessary proof when purchasing grain with nationwide usable grain tickets. For larger quantities, additional approval procedures are required. This is correct and should be maintained.

　　全国通用粮票没有停止使用
    广西、湖南等地一些读者来信，询问有关全国通用粮票的使用问题。我们请商业部粮食购销司作了如下答复：
    问：全国通用粮票的职能是什么？
    答：全国通用粮票是购买粮食和粮食制成品的凭证，供跨省（自治区、直辖市）流动人口使用。这些人出差、旅行、探亲、施工、就医时，可凭全国通用粮票在外就餐；或按当地规定，购买粮食和粮食制成品。
    问：全国通用粮票是否要停止使用？
    答：全国通用粮票没有停止使用，仍然和过去一样流通。有的地方规定全国通用粮票临时停止使用。这是个别地方擅自规定的，应当纠正。
    问：凭全国通用粮票可以购买哪些粮食品种？
    答：凭全国通用粮票购粮时，按当地粮食部门规定的供应品种比例购买。例如，人们在北京市用全国通用粮票购粮时，供应面粉百分之五十五，大米百分之二十，粗粮百分之二十五。
    问：凭全国通用粮票购粮是否限制数量？
    答：食品行业、集体伙食单位凭收回的全国通用粮票购粮，一般不限制数量。城乡居民凭全国通用粮票购粮，只要数量不大，有正当来源，一般也准许购买。所谓正当来源是指家里有外来的亲友。
    为了防止不法分子倒买倒卖全国通用粮票，保证合理供应粮食，有些地方规定凭全国通用粮票购粮时，要必要的证明；数量大的，还要经过一定批准手续。这是正确的，应该坚持。
