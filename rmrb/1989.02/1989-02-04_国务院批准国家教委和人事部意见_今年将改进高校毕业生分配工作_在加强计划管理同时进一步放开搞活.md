The State Council has approved the opinions of the State Education Commission and the Ministry of Personnel on improving the allocation of college graduates in 1989, which were recently issued to local governments and universities.

The State Education Commission and the Ministry of Personnel proposed that while strengthening planned management, the allocation of graduates should be further liberalized. The main approach is to combine the efforts of the competent departments and schools to formulate the allocation plan for graduates. Starting from 1989, the State Education Commission's affiliated schools will implement a system where schools, based on the state's allocation policies and social needs, propose an allocation plan in conjunction with the specific circumstances of the graduates. After the State Education Commission's approval, the plan will be executed as the state allocation plan. Other ministries under the State Council and local governments will follow this approach.

The two commissions also proposed several measures to improve the allocation of college graduates: gradually implementing the recommendation and recruitment system to send graduates to society; gradually implementing the pre-allocation system one year in advance, starting from 1989, various ministries and local governments will select schools to pilot this system and gradually promote it; widely exchanging supply and demand information to smooth the allocation channels; strengthening horizontal adjustments between ministries and local governments to promote talent exchange. The two commissions' improvement opinions also emphasize: the allocation plan for graduates, after being agreed upon through consultation, must be seriously implemented. Schools may not reassign graduates, and employers may not return graduates without the consent of both the school and the employer. The leadership of the allocation work for graduates must be strengthened, and the transparency of the allocation work must be increased.

In response to new situations and the requirements of deepening reforms, the two commissions made the following new important regulations in their improvement opinions: First, in accordance with the State Council's instructions to strictly control the entry of new personnel into government agencies starting from 1989, all levels of government agencies will supplement personnel through open examinations and select the best candidates. Therefore, government agencies will recruit college graduates through examinations. Local graduate allocation departments should coordinate with personnel departments to prepare for this. Second, starting from 1989, ordinary colleges and universities that do not obtain graduation qualifications will not be responsible for the allocation of graduates. However, schools must be responsible for recommending graduates to employers. If no employer accepts the graduate within three months, their files, grain ration, and household registration will be transferred back to their place of origin (those living in rural areas will retain their non-agricultural household registration), and they will be self-employed. In addition, for graduates who have obtained graduation qualifications but have not been accepted by employers due to receiving serious disciplinary actions during their school years and not correcting their mistakes, this method will also be adopted. Third, in the future, the term "paid allocation" for graduates will no longer be used.

According to another report, after the State Council approved the above improvement opinions of the two commissions, the State Education Commission has issued a notice to relevant departments, local governments, and affiliated universities, proposing opinions on doing a good job in the allocation of graduates from the State Education Commission's affiliated universities in 1989.

### 国务院批准国家教委和人事部意见  今年将改进高校毕业生分配工作  在加强计划管理同时进一步放开搞活

　　国务院批准国家教委和人事部意见
　  今年将改进高校毕业生分配工作
　  在加强计划管理同时进一步放开搞活
    本报北京２月３日讯  记者毕全忠报道：国家教委和人事部联合提出的改进１９８９年高校毕业生分配工作的意见经国务院批准，最近下达各地政府和高等学校。
    国家教委和人事部提出的改进意见，主张在加强计划管理的同时进一步将毕业生分配工作放开、搞活。其主要办法是主管部门与学校上下结合制订毕业生分配计划。从１９８９年起，国家教委直属学校实行由学校根据国家的分配方针、政策和社会需求，结合毕业生的具体情况，提出分配计划，经国家教委审定后作为国家分配计划下达执行的办法。国务院其它部门和各地方参照这一办法实行。
    两部委还提出改进高校毕业生分配工作的若干措施：逐步实行推荐录用的办法向社会输送毕业生；逐步实行提前一年预分配的办法，从１９８９年起各部委和地方要选择学校试行，逐步推广；广泛开展供需信息交流，疏通分配渠道；加强部委、地方间的横向调剂，促进人才交流。两部委的改进意见还强调：经过协商落实的毕业生分配计划必须认真执行，未经学校和用人单位双方复议，学校不得改派毕业生，用人单位不得退回毕业生；要加强毕业生分配工作的领导，增加分配工作的透明度。
    根据新的情况和深化改革的要求，两部委在改进意见中还作出以下新的重要规定：一，根据国务院关于从１９８９年起对新进政府机关工作人员要按公务员条件把好“进口关”的指示，各级政府机关补充人员均实行公开考试，择优录用，因此，政府机关补充大学毕业生要实行考试录用。各地毕业生分配部门要与人事部门联系做好准备工作。二，１９８９年起，普通高校未取得毕业资格的结业生，国家不负分配工作的责任，但学校要认真负责地向用人单位作推荐。如３个月之内无接受单位的，其档案、粮食户口关系将转回家庭所在地（家居农村的保留非农业户口），由本人自主择业。此外，对虽已取得毕业资格，但因在校期间受过较重处分、改正错误不好，因而无用人单位接收的毕业生，也采取此办法处理。三，今后不再沿用“有偿分配”毕业生的提法。
    另据消息，国务院批准两部委上述改进意见之后，国家教委已向有关部门、各地方和直属高等学校发出通知，提出做好教委直属高校今年毕业生分配工作的意见。
