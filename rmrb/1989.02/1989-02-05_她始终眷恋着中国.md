It was a summer evening in 1988. We had just finished a 10-day trip to southern Ukraine in the Soviet Union and were resting in our hotel, preparing to set out early the next morning. Suddenly, the telephone in our room rang, and a woman's hurried voice came through the receiver:

“Hello, are you the Chinese people from Moscow? I finally found you! I’m coming to pick you up right now. Please wait for me at the hotel entrance. Anna Ilyichina has been waiting for you all afternoon and will be so happy to see you!”

Who was she? Where did she plan to take us? Before we could ask, the phone had already hung up.

After hanging up the phone, we remembered that the day before, during our visit to the Nikita Botanical Garden, our guide had mentioned that there was a staff member who had studied in China and married a Chinese girl. They had been living in Yalta for many years. It seemed she must have heard the news and come to ask us about the situation in our homeland. But who was Anna Ilyichina? We had never met her before, so why had she been waiting for us all afternoon?

The hotel where we were staying was one of the luxurious hotels by the Black Sea. It was located on a hillside overlooking the sea. At this moment, the setting sun was casting its glow on the sea, creating a dazzling array of colors. Soon, the colors faded like a dream.

A Chinese woman in her forties hurriedly approached us, and we immediately recognized her as the one who had called.

“Hello!” she exclaimed excitedly, pointing to a small car parked nearby. “Get in! I want to surprise Anna Ilyichina. She will be so grateful to me!”

In the car, she introduced herself: “My name is Chen Yalan. I graduated from Beijing Medical College. In the 1960s, I came to the Soviet Union with my husband. We initially lived in Moscow and later moved here.”

“Who is Anna Ilyichina to you?”

“Who is she to me?” she asked, her eyes wide with surprise. “She is the wife of the famous novelist of ‘The Seagull,’ the second Ostrovsky of the Soviet Union—Biryukov!”

We couldn’t help but exclaim, “Oh!” Who among the Chinese youth of the 1950s didn’t know “The Seagull”? It was a novel written by Biryukov in the 1940s, describing the heroic deeds of a young female guerrilla fighter, Chazhina, who sacrificed herself in the anti-Fascist war of defense. Biryukov’s experiences and the fate of the author of “How the Steel Was Tempered,” Ostrovsky, were remarkably similar. At the age of 18, he was injured while rescuing a construction site and spent 36 years on a sickbed and in a wheelchair. During this time, he persisted in writing, inspiring and educating the youth with his heroic characters. “The Seagull” was published in China in the 1950s and re-translated and published again in the 1980s. This book had a positive influence on Chinese youth in different periods. Biryukov passed away in 1966, and we never expected that his widow was still living in this city and had become the curator of the Biryukov Memorial Museum.

“Yesterday, Anna Ilyichina received a notice that a Chinese delegation would be visiting the Biryukov Museum. She was so excited that she prepared a lot of good food and bought a bouquet of flowers. But she waited all afternoon and didn’t see anyone. I found out after work. I thought, since it’s a Chinese delegation, they must be staying at the Yalta Hotel. Look, I found you!” Yalan spoke excitedly.

“We are not a delegation, and we were not scheduled to visit the museum!” we quickly explained.

“It must be some bureaucratic mistake. But it doesn’t matter. Anna Ilyichina will be overjoyed to see you. She has deep feelings for the Chinese people!”

The car slowly drove up the winding mountain road and soon stopped in front of a small house surrounded by a fence. Before we could step through the gate, Yalan proudly called out:

“Anna Ilyichina, I brought the Chinese guests for you!”

The door on the second floor opened. Standing before us was a dignified, kind-looking elderly woman. She was of medium height, wearing a loose dress, and her thin face bore a warm smile, making her appear so gentle and approachable.

“Ah, finally, you’ve come. They told me your leader is an elderly person and not in good health…”

At this moment, we finally understood. She must have confused us with the Chinese People’s Friendship Delegation led by Comrade Wu Xiuquan. The delegation had left Yalta the day before and was on their way back to China via Moscow. We quickly explained that we were reporters, not part of the delegation. Anna Ilyichina smiled and said:

“As long as you are Chinese, it’s the same to me.”

She welcomed us into the living room on the second floor, where we drank tea and chatted like old friends. The old woman was immersed in her unforgettable memories. In the 1930s, young Anna was a teacher at a middle school. Biryukov was then living in a hospital, a paralyzed patient who was unable to move around and needed help.

Kind-hearted Anna volunteered to take care of this disabled person. After some time, they developed feelings for each other, and their shared mission brought them together, eventually becoming lifelong partners. After the outbreak of the Patriotic War, she pushed the wheelchair with Biryukov to the rear, interviewing war heroes and model workers, writing touching articles. Later, she assisted him in writing the novel “The Waters of Narin,” which described the excavation of a large canal. In 1966, Biryukov passed away, and Anna Ilyichina decided to turn this residence into a museum. The old woman said with deep emotion, “Every time a group of young people comes to visit, I feel that I am not alone, as if I can still see Biryukov among us.”

The writer had met many foreign friends in his lifetime, receiving countless letters from readers every day, many of which came from China. Biryukov’s creative life was very difficult. His head was tilted and couldn’t move, making his handwriting often hard to decipher. Despite these difficulties, he personally wrote letters to Chinese readers, enthusiastically helping them correct letter after letter in Russian. At this moment, Anna took out a stack of letters and faded photographs sent by Chinese readers. Some of these letters were sent from Wuhan, others from Suzhou… The young women with short hair in the photographs were now nearly fifty years old. They could never have imagined that more than 30 years ago, the letters and photographs they sent to the author of “The Seagull” were still being treasured by this kind-hearted Soviet elderly woman. Anna excitedly told us, “Even during the difficult times in Sino-Soviet relations, I still kept these letters. They are tokens of friendship!” Seeing these letters with Chinese stamps and listening to the host’s heartfelt words, our eyes welled up with tears.

It was this noble friendship that drove the Biryukov couple to invite the Chen Yalan family of four, who had just arrived in Yalta from Moscow with nowhere to stay, to live in their home, thus forming a deep friendship.

It was this eternal friendship that drove Mrs. Anna to preserve these letters during the turbulent times and to enthusiastically receive us when she heard that Chinese guests had come to Yalta, hoping that we could help her find the authors of these letters, even if they could write a few words, she would be greatly comforted.

It was this…

It was late at night, and we bid farewell to this elderly woman who was nearly a hundred years old. Mrs. Anna saw us off to the door. Looking at her frail figure, we felt that she, along with the protagonist of “The Seagull,” Chazhina, and the writer Biryukov, were all like Danka in Gorky’s works, burning themselves to light the way for others.

　　她始终眷恋着中国
　　唐修哲　孙润玉
    那是１９８８年夏天的一个傍晚。我们结束了为期１０天的苏联乌克兰南部之行，正在旅馆稍事休息，准备第二天一早上路。突然，房间里的电话铃响了，话筒里传来一位妇女急促的声音：
    “喂，您是莫斯科来的中国人吗？终于找到你们了！我现在就来接你们，请在旅馆门口等我。安娜·伊里奇娜整整等了你们一下午，看到你们不知该有多么高兴呢！”她是谁？她打算把我们接到哪里去？还没有来得及张口提问，电话已经挂断。
    放下电话，我们才想起前一天在参观尼基塔植物园时陪同人员曾提起该园有位工作人员在中国留学时和一位中国姑娘结了婚，他们在雅尔塔已定居多年。看来她一定是闻讯赶来向我们了解祖国情况的了。不过，安娜·伊里奇娜又是谁呢？我们与她素不相识，干嘛要白白等我们一个下午呢？
    我们下榻的旅馆是黑海之滨豪华的旅馆之一。它坐落在临海的半山腰上。此时，夕阳西沉，落日余辉映照大海，放射出道道绚丽的彩霞。很快，彩霞便梦一般地消失了。
    一位４０开外的中国妇女匆匆向我们走来，一眼猜到她就是打来电话的那位了。
    “喂，你们好！”她兴奋地大声嚷着，并指着停在附近的一辆小轿车说：“上车吧！我要给安娜·伊里奇娜来个突然袭击，她不知该怎样感谢我呢？”
    在汽车里，她自我介绍起来：“我叫陈雅兰，北京医学院毕业。６０年代随丈夫来到苏联，最初住在莫斯科，后来迁居到这里。”
    “安娜·伊里奇娜是您的什么人呢？”
    “是我的什么人？”她睁大眼睛惊讶地问道。“她就是著名小说《海鸥》的作者、苏联第二个奥斯特洛夫斯基——比留科夫的夫人呀！”
    我们不由地“哦！”了一声。提起《海鸥》，５０年代的中国青年谁不知道！它是比留科夫４０年代写就的一部小说，描写一位年轻的女游击队员柴金娜在反法西斯的卫国战争中英勇牺牲的动人事迹。比留科夫的经历和《钢铁是怎样炼成的》作者奥斯特洛夫斯基遭遇非常酷似，１８岁时他在建筑工地抢险致残，在病榻和轮椅上度过了３６个春秋，在此期间坚持写作，以英雄人物鼓舞和教育青年。《海鸥》于５０年代在中国出版，８０年代重译再次出版。这本书对不同时期的中国青年都起了积极影响。比留科夫于１９６６年离开人世，没想到他的遗孀仍住在这个城市里，成了比留科夫故居博物馆的馆长。
    “昨天安娜·伊里奇娜接到通知，说是有个中国代表团要参观比留科夫博物馆。她激动得不得了，准备了许多好吃的，还买了一束鲜花。可是等了一下午也没有等到。我下班后才得知。我想，既然是中国代表团，肯定住在雅尔塔旅馆，这不，我不是把你们找来了吗？”雅兰滔滔不绝地说着。
    “我们不是什么代表团，也没有为我们安排这项参观呀！”我们连忙辩解说。
    “肯定是哪个官僚主义的办事人员给弄错了。不过，没关系，见到你们安娜·伊里奇娜会高兴得要命的，她对中国人感情可深厚哩！”
    汽车在盘山公路上缓缓行驶，很快便在一座围着栏杆的小楼前停了下来。刚来得及迈进大门，雅兰就得意地叫道：
    “安娜·伊里奇娜，我给您把中国客人领来了！”
    二楼的门打开了。出现在我们眼前的是一位端庄、慈祥的老人。她，中等身材，身上穿着一件宽松的连裙衫，清癯的脸上带着亲切的微笑，显得那样和蔼可亲。
    “啊，终于把你们盼来了。他们告诉我，你们团长是位上年纪的人，身体不太好……”
    此时我们才恍然大悟，她一定把我们和伍修权同志率领的中国人民友好代表团搞混了。伍老一行前一天已经离开雅尔塔取道莫斯科回国了。于是我们赶忙解释，我们是记者，不是代表团。安娜·伊里奇娜微笑地说：
    “只要是中国人，对我都一样。”
    说着她把我们迎进了二楼的客厅，边喝茶、边聊天，就像多年不见的老朋友一样。老人沉浸在难忘的回忆中。３０年代，年轻的安娜曾是一所中学的女教员。比留科夫当时住在医院里，是个瘫痪病人，行动不便，需要有人帮助。
    善良的安娜自愿义务侍候这位残疾人。过了一段时间，他们之间产生了感情，共同的事业把他们结合在一起，终于结成了终生伴侣。卫国战争爆发后，她推着轮椅和比留科夫一起在后方采访战斗英雄和生产能手，写出了一篇篇动人的文章，后来她又协助他写出了描写开凿大运河的小说《纳林之水》。１９６６年比留科夫与世长辞，安娜·伊里奇娜决定把这所故居辟为博物馆。老人深情地说：“每当一批批年青人前来参观时，我就感到自己并不孤独，仿佛看到比留科夫仍然活在人间。”
    作家一生结识了不少外国朋友，每天都要收到大批读者来信，其中有不少来自中国。比留科夫的创作生活是很艰苦的。他的头歪着不能转动，写下的字迹往往很难辨认。在这样困难的情况下，他还亲自提笔给中国读者复信，热情地为他们修改一封封俄文信。此时安娜拿出了一叠中国读者寄来的信和褪了色的照片。这些信有的寄自武汉，有的写自苏州……照片上的那些剪短发姑娘如今都已年近半百。她们哪能想到，３０多年前寄给《海鸥》作者的信和照片至今仍为这慈祥的苏联老太太视如珍宝地收藏着。安娜激动地对我们说：“在苏中关系不好的年代里，我仍然保存着这些信件，这是友好感情的信物！”看到这一封封贴着中国邮票的信件，听着主人的肺腑之言，我们的眼睛湿润了。
    正是这种崇高的友谊驱使比留科夫夫妇在陈雅兰一家４口由莫斯科初到雅尔塔无处栖身时，邀请她们全家住到自己家里，从此结下了莫逆之交。
    正是这种永恒的友谊驱使安娜夫人在风云变幻时期保存了这些信件，并在得悉中国客人来到雅尔塔时热情地接待了我们，希望我们能协助她找到写这些信的作者，那怕能给她再写上片言只语，她也会感到莫大的欣慰。
    正是……
    夜深了，我们和这位年近耄耋的老人惜别。安娜夫人把我们一直送到门口。望着她瘦削的身影，我们感到她和《海鸥》的主人翁柴金娜以及作家比留科夫都像高尔基作品中的丹柯一样，都是燃烧自己又点燃别人的崇高的人。
