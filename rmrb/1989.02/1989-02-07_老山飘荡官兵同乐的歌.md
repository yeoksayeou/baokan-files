The eve of the Spring Festival at Old Mountain is shrouded in thick fog.

Leaders and staff from the frontline troops have mostly gone to the frontline trenches to spend the New Year with the soldiers. Accompanied by Commander Chen Qingyun, a major general, the reporter traversed the winding mountain paths, visiting one trench after another.

The fog was so dense that one could barely make out the silhouette of the person walking ahead. However, upon entering the trenches, a lively New Year atmosphere greeted us: flowerpots and bonsai adorned the trenches, and New Year paintings along with calligraphy and paintings created by the soldiers hung on the walls. Inside the "cat-ear" caves, officers were busy preparing delicious New Year's food for the soldiers.

A company officer told the reporter that this year, they raised pigs, grew vegetables, made tofu, and sprouted beans themselves. They also learned to make rice noodles and pickled vegetables. Coupled with the food sent by the leadership and the local people, their New Year's Eve dinner would have about 20 dishes!

The frontline officers and soldiers are very harmonious and close-knit. When the soldiers saw Major General Chen Qingyun, they eagerly surrounded him. Chen Qingyun asked, "Have you received any letters from home?" Before he could finish, the soldiers chorused, "Yes!" Several soldiers took out letters from their pockets and spread them out to show their commander. One soldier had written a poem titled "Commander and 'Cat-Ear Cave' Soldiers Celebrate the New Year Together," which Chen Qingyun read and then wrote in the margins, "Soldiers are the most lovable and respectable people!"

The 7th Company's position is on the top of a steep cliff, requiring a climb up an iron "cloud ladder" to reach. Company Commander Fan Shaolin introduced to Chen Qingyun, who had come to pay New Year's greetings, a poem that the soldiers had recently composed in praise of the "cloud ladder":

Like a rainbow,
Like a spine,
Drops of sweat, drops of blood,
Bullet marks on the heroic path.
The people understand me,
Loved ones support me,
Three hundred feet up and down,
The military spirit strengthens the mountains and rivers...

Chen Qingyun praised the poem as magnificent and heroic, a true song of the Old Mountain soldiers. He then grabbed the "cloud ladder" and began to climb the cliff, which seemed to have no end in sight.

As night fell, the 7th Company's Spring Festival gala began. Telephone lines connected several nearby positions. Soldiers in the "cat-ear" caves pressed their ears to the headsets, enjoying the performances. Major General Chen Qingyun took the microphone and sang several powerful marching songs. The soldiers clapped and shouted into the microphone, "Sing 'Sister, boldly go forward'!" Chen Qingyun replied without hesitation, "Sing it is, I'm not familiar with the tune, if I sing off-key, please guide me." He then sang several popular songs that the soldiers loved. As he sang, one could hear the soldiers humming along through the headsets.

Amidst the calls for "another song," a soldier suddenly asked, "Commander, do you miss home during the Spring Festival?"

Chen Qingyun immediately responded, "I do. But in my heart, this trench, you soldiers, are much more important than my home!" The trench erupted in applause.

After the gala, Major General Chen Qingyun found a "cat-ear" cave, lay down on the bed, and had a heart-to-heart talk with the cave's owner.

Under the deep night sky, the densely packed peaks of Old Mountain resembled the silhouettes of soldiers leaning on each other's shoulders.

　　老山飘荡官兵同乐的歌
    新华社记者　段建勋　新华社通讯员　苏维纪
    春节前夕的老山，雾霭重重。
    前线部队领导同志和机关干部，大都去前沿阵地和战士共度新春佳节了。记者随指挥员陈庆云大校沿着蜿蜒曲折的山路，向一个个阵地走去。
    雾浓得只能依稀辨别走在前面的人的背影。但是，跨进一道道堑壕，见到的却是一番热气蒸腾的节日景象：堑壕里摆着花卉盆景，壕壁上张挂着年画和出自战士之手的绘画、书法作品。猫耳洞里，干部们躬身钻进钻出，忙着为士兵们准备可口的节日食品。
    一位连队干部告诉记者，今年他们自己动手养猪种菜，磨豆腐，生豆芽，还学会了做米线、腌小菜，加上领导机关和各地群众送的食品，年夜饭可上２０来道菜呢！
    前线官兵十分融洽、亲密。战士们见到陈庆云大校，便前跑后推地拥上前来。陈庆云问大家：“家里来信没有？”话音刚落，战士们便一迭声地回答：“来了！”说着，有几名战士从衣兜里掏出家信，铺展开来给自己的指挥官看。有一名战士写了首《首长和‘猫耳洞’战士共度新春佳节感怀》的诗，陈庆云读后，掏出笔来，在诗的空隙处写道：“战士是最可爱最可敬的人！”
    七连的阵地，设在一道陡峭如削的岩壁顶端，上下要攀登一道由角铁焊成的“云梯”。连长范绍林向前来给他们拜年的陈庆云介绍了战士们新近“凑”成的一首赞“云梯”的诗：
    像一道彩虹，
    像一道脊梁，
    滴滴汗水，点点鲜血，
    弹痕累累英雄路。
    人民理解我，
    亲人支持我，
    上下三百尺，
    军魂壮山河……
    陈庆云称赞这首诗气势恢宏，是老山战士的英雄歌。说毕，他抓住“云梯”，向仰头不见顶的岩壁攀登。
    夜幕降临，七连的迎春联欢晚会开始了。电话线串联起了附近的几个阵地。“猫耳洞”里的战士把耳机紧贴着耳朵，欣赏文艺节目。陈庆云大校拿着话筒，唱了几首雄浑昂扬的队列歌曲。战士们边鼓掌边对着话筒喊：“来一个‘妹妹你大胆的往前走’！”陈庆云毫不迟疑地答道：“唱就唱，我‘路’不熟，唱岔了，请大家指引。”之后，他接连唱了几首战士们爱听的通俗歌曲。他在唱，耳机里听得出战士们也在应和。
    在一片“请再来一支”的喊声里，突然夹杂着一名战士的问话：“首长，春节想不想家？”
    陈庆云马上作答：“想。但是，在我的心中，阵地这个家，你们这些亲人，比我那个家重得多！”阵地上刹时掌声骤起。
    晚会结束后，陈庆云大校找了个“猫耳洞”，往铺上一躺，曲着膝，与洞主人谈起心来。
    深沉夜色中，老山那挤挤挨挨的山峰，宛如官兵膀靠着膀的雄姿剪影。
