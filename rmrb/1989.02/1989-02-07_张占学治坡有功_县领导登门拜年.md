Zhang Zhanxue's efforts in slope management have earned him the title of a modern-day Yu Gong. Over four years, he and his family of ten have achieved significant results in managing barren slopes and gullies.

On the eve of the Spring Festival, County Communist Party Secretary Wang Shuqing paid a New Year visit to Zhang's home and presented him with a couplet:

The upper part of the couplet reads: "Through reform, the once barren mountains now echo with the sounds of agriculture and animal husbandry."

The lower part of the couplet reads: "With faith in science, the once turbulent waters now teem with leaping fish and singing birds of happiness."

The horizontal scroll reads: "Ecological Agriculture."

At 38 years old, Zhang Zhanxue is a farmer from Qixin Village, Sandao Town, Baiquan County, Heilongjiang Province. Seeing the severe soil erosion in his hometown, he decided to take action. In the spring of 1985, he signed a contract with the village to manage 357 acres of barren slopes and gullies. He then sold his village home, built three thatched huts on the edge of the forest, and moved his family to the barren gully to focus on managing the slopes and gullies.

Zhang Zhanxue raised funds from various sources, investing over 100,000 yuan. He managed ten eroded slopes, built three water reservoirs, and dug a 250-meter-long diversion ditch, covering 91% of the area that needed management. Simultaneously, he planted fruit trees on the slopes, practiced intercropping of trees, grains, and grasses; raised cows and pigs; bred geese and fish in the reservoirs; and planted rice outside the dikes, creating a model of ecological agriculture that integrates land and water resources in a three-dimensional and comprehensive manner. Last year, Zhang Zhanxue's family income from forestry, animal husbandry, fisheries, and grain reached over 300,000 yuan. He has been awarded the titles of County and Municipal Labor Model.

　　张占学治坡有功　县领导登门拜年
    新华社哈尔滨２月６日电  被誉为当代愚公的张占学，一家１０口人治理荒坡荒沟四载，取得很大成绩。
    春节前夕，县委副书记王树青登门拜年，并赠送了一副对联：
    上联是“靠改革多年穷山今日松涛声声高奏农牧曲”；
    下联是“信科学过去恶水现在鱼跃飞飞又唱幸福歌”。
    横披是“生态农业”。
    今年３８岁的张占学是黑龙江省拜泉县三道镇齐心村农民。他见家乡水土流失严重，决计进行治理。１９８５年春，他和村里签定了治理３５７亩荒坡荒沟的合同，然后卖掉村里的住房，在林地边上盖了三间草房，携家带口搬到荒沟居住，一心一意治理荒沟荒坡。
    张占学多方筹措资金，先后投资１万多元，治理侵蚀坡１０条，修水池３处，开出一条长２５０米的截流沟，治理面积占应治理面积的９１％。同时，张占学在坡上栽果树，搞林粮、林草间作；还养了牛和猪；在水池里养鹅、养鱼；在堤坝外种上水稻，形成了坡上坡下，土地、水面立体开发，综合治理的生态农业模式。去年，张占学家的林、牧、渔、粮等项收入达３万多元。他先后被评为县、市劳动模范。
