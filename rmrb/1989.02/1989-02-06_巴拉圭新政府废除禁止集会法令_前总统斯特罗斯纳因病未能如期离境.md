	Asuncion News: Paraguay's new government announced on the 4th that it will abolish the No. 1 decree issued by the Stroessner military regime this year, which prohibited citizens from holding gatherings with relatives and friends.

	The No. 1 decree stipulates that citizens cannot gather with relatives and friends in various places without police permission. The new government decided to cancel all restrictions on citizens gathering with relatives and friends and holding meetings from now on, and meetings do not need to be approved by the government authorities.

	The Catholic Church authorities in Paraguay expressed satisfaction with the new government's decision.

	Paraguay's new government was formed on the 3rd after General Rodriguez staged a coup, overthrowing Stroessner's dictatorship.

	Asuncion News: The deposed former President of Paraguay, Stroessner, suffered a heart attack and was unable to leave Paraguay as originally planned in the afternoon of the 4th.

	According to a reporter from the Argentine Telam News Agency, citing officials from Paraguay's current government, Stroessner was originally scheduled to board a Paraguayan Airlines plane to fly to Chile, and then from Chile to Miami, USA, to settle down. However, due to a heart attack, he needed rest and examination, so the plane prepared for him remained at the airport on standby.

	The military dictator who ruled Paraguay for 35 years, Stroessner, was ousted in the military coup that took place on the 2nd. The new government, led by General Rodriguez, decided to exile Stroessner abroad.

　　前总统斯特罗斯纳因病未能如期离境
    新华社布宜诺斯艾利斯２月４日电  亚松森消息：巴拉圭新政府４日宣布，废除斯特罗斯纳军政权今年发布的关于禁止公民举行亲友聚会的１号法令。
    １号法令规定，任何公民未经警方许可，不得与在各地的亲友聚会。新政府决定，从即日起，取消对公民与亲友聚会和举行集会的任何限制，集会无需得到政府当局的批准。
    巴拉圭教会当局对新政府的这一决定表示满意。
    巴拉圭新政府是在罗德里格斯将军发动政变、推翻斯特罗斯纳独裁政权后，于３日组成的。
    新华社布宜诺斯艾利斯２月４日电　亚松森消息：被推翻的巴拉圭前总统斯特罗斯纳因心脏病发作，未能按原计划于４日下午离开巴拉圭。
    据阿根廷特拉姆通讯社记者援引巴拉圭现政府人士的话说，斯特罗斯纳原定乘坐巴拉圭航空公司的一架飞机飞往智利，然后从智利去美国的迈阿密定居，但因心脏病发作，需要休息和检查，那架准备好的飞机便一直停留在机场待命。
    统治巴拉圭达３５年之久的军人独裁者斯特罗斯纳在２日发生的军事政变中被赶下台。以罗德里格斯将军为首的新政府决定将斯特罗斯纳放逐国外。
