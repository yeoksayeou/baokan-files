Both to liberalize and activate and to regulate and manage
Shanghai uses legal means to commercialize and rectify the circulation system
Determined to shut down a batch of companies that specialize in reselling

	Shanghai, February 24 (Reported by Lü Wangda): In response to the current disorder in the circulation sector, Shanghai is taking steps to use legal means to commercialize and rectify the circulation system, aiming to achieve both liberalization and activation, as well as regulation and management.

	In recent years, Shanghai has seen the establishment of numerous "companies" and "centers," many of which are engaged in commercial wholesale. The city now has over 4,000 wholesale enterprises of various sizes. With so many industries involved in commerce, the channels have become chaotic. Some engage in layer-upon-layer profiteering and exorbitant pricing, while others cross-industry operations and compete to sell high-profit goods. There are over 1,000 dealers for color TVs alone, while the repair and maintenance services that consumers need are shrinking, causing strong dissatisfaction among consumers.

	Shanghai's current rectification of the circulation order focuses on the rectification of wholesale commerce, particularly in daily industrial goods. This year, all enterprises engaged in the wholesale of industrial consumer goods will be re-registered according to the qualifications and conditions of wholesale enterprises. The city is determined to shut down a batch of companies that specialize in reselling. Retail enterprises that arbitrarily rent out counters and sell substandard, overpriced, counterfeit, or fake goods are also being rectified. For individual businesses, the prominent issues of illegal, non-lawful operations, and tax evasion will be addressed through a comprehensive approach of "education, guidance, suppression, and elimination."

　　既要放开搞活　又要制约管理
    上海以法治商整顿流通
    下决心关掉一批专门从事转手倒卖的公司
    本报上海２月２４日电  记者吕网大报道：针对当前流通领域的混乱现象，上海市正着手以法治商并进行整顿，做到既要放开搞活，又要制约管理。
    上海近年来成立的“公司”、“中心”等，不少都在搞商业批发，全市大大小小的批发企业超过４０００家。百业经商，渠道紊乱，有的层层盘剥、漫天要价，有的跨业经营、竞相经营高利商品，光彩电经销单位就达１０００多家，而群众需要的修配服务业务则日趋萎缩，引起消费者的强烈不满。
    上海市这次整顿流通秩序，抓批发商业的整顿，重点是日用工业品批发。年内对全市经营工业消费品批发业务的企业，按批发企业的资格和条件全部重新登记，下决心关掉一批专门从事转手倒卖的各种公司；零售企业中任意出租柜台，出售质次价高、顶冒牌号的伪劣商品，也在整顿之列；对个体经营中的不法、非法经营和偷漏税收的突出问题，采取“教育、疏导、打击、取缔”四管齐下的整顿办法。
