	Five Rounds of Fierce Combat Lasting Eighteen Minutes
	Bruno Kneels Before Tyson

	Xinhua News Agency, Washington, February 25 (Reporter: Lu Wenyi) The world heavyweight boxing champion, American Mike Tyson, tonight in the fifth round, with a barrage of more than ten heavy punches, struck British champion Frank Bruno to the point of disorientation, forcing him to kneel in submission. This match, representing the highest level of boxing on both sides of the Atlantic, took place at 10:33 PM (Beijing time, February 26, 11:33 AM) at the Hilton Hotel in Las Vegas, USA. Bruno challenged Tyson. Both sides were originally scheduled to fight for 12 rounds, but the result, as boxing insiders had predicted, was that Tyson, with just 5 rounds and 18 minutes, overwhelmed Bruno, who started the match fiercely, leaving him unable to defend himself and leaning against the ropes, unable to move.

	At 10:25 PM, when Bruno, draped in a bright red robe, entered the arena flanked by his coach and entourage, the 2,000 British fans in the audience immediately waved Union Jacks and cheered. Two minutes later, Tyson, wearing only shorts, began his first fight in eight months.

	In the first three rounds, due to Bruno's height and long arms, he specialized in long-range punches, causing Tyson to take several hits. In the fourth round, Tyson changed his strategy, continuously striking Bruno's chest and waist, making it difficult for his opponent to throw punches. By the fifth round, the 27-year-old Bruno's momentum had significantly decreased, his punches lacked power, while the 22-year-old Tyson was full of energy and fighting spirit. Not only did he throw punches rapidly, but he also hit accurate spots. The final ten punches all landed on Bruno's waist, jaw, cheek, and forehead, finally knocking him out completely.

	This victory kept Tyson's undefeated record at 36 matches, of which 31 were knockouts. Bruno's current record is 32 wins and 3 losses. Although this challenge ended in failure, his performance was still impressive compared to Michael Spinks. Because in June of last year, Tyson knocked out Spinks in just 90 seconds.

	This major match was broadcast by the American "Home Box Office" cable television network, which paid Tyson $3.8 million. Bruno also earned $2 million.

　　交手五回合　历时十八分
    布鲁诺向泰森俯首称臣
    新华社华盛顿２月２５日电  （记者陆文岳）世界重量级拳击冠军美国的迈克·泰森今晚在第五个回合中，以急雨似的十几个重拳把英国拳王弗兰克·布鲁诺打得晕头转向，迫使他俯首称臣。这场代表大西洋两岸最高水准的大决斗是今晚１０点３３分（北京时间２６日中午１１点３３分）在美国赌城拉斯维加斯的希尔顿大饭店举行的。由布鲁诺向泰森挑战。双方原定斗１２个回合，但结果正如拳击界人士早就预料的那样，泰森仅以５个回合１８分钟便把开场时来势凶猛的布鲁诺打得招架不住，靠在栏杆上动弹不得。
    １０点２５分，当布鲁诺披着一身大红袍在教练和亲随簇拥下威风凛凛步入赛场时，场内的２０００名英国人立刻高举米字旗欢呼起来。两分钟后，泰森穿裤衩赤膊上阵，开始了他八个月来的首场格斗。
    在头三个回合的比赛中，由于布鲁诺人高臂长，专击长拳，使泰森频频挨揍。第四个回合泰森改变打法，不断朝布鲁诺的胸腰冲击，迫使对手难以出拳。到第五个回合，２７岁的布鲁诺的势头大减，挥拳无力，而２２岁的泰森却显得精神抖擞，斗志猛增，不仅出拳迅猛，而且落点准确，最后的十几拳全部击中布鲁诺的腰眼、下颌、颊部和前额等处，终于把对手彻底击溃。
    这次胜利使泰森保持了３６场不败记录，其中有３１场是把对手击倒而获胜的。布鲁诺的目前战绩是胜３２场，负三场。尽管他此次挑战以失败告终，但比起迈克尔·斯平克斯，他的成绩还是光彩的。因为在去年６月泰森与斯平克斯的一场比赛中，泰森只用了９０秒钟便将斯平克斯击倒。
    这场大赛是美国“家庭票房公司”有线电视台转播的，它向泰森付了３８０万美元。布鲁诺也可净得２００万美元。
