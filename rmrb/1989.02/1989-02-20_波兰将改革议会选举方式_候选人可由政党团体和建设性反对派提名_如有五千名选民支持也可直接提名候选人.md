Poland to Reform Parliamentary Election Methods

Candidates can be nominated by political parties, organizations, and constructive opposition

Candidates can also be directly nominated with the support of 5,000 voters

Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, February 18th: Today, Ciprianek, a member of the Polish United Workers' Party Central Committee, stated that in the next parliamentary elections in Poland, candidates can be nominated not only by various political parties, organizations, and constructive opposition groups but also directly by voters, provided they have the support of 5,000 voters.

Ciprianek revealed this information during the second meeting of the "Round Table" political reform group in Poland, where the new election law was discussed. He believes that this nomination method can better reflect public opinion and be more competitive.

For a long time, Poland's parliamentary elections have been conducted through a system where various political parties and organizations nominate candidates through consultation and hold equal-numbered elections. In the early 1980s, the Polish authorities changed the equal-numbered elections to a system of differential elections, but the method of nominating candidates remained the same. The practice of voters directly nominating candidates is undoubtedly a new attempt.

Ciprianek suggested that the next parliament should still consist of 460 members, with 1/10 of the members selected from a national candidate list and the remaining members selected from local candidate lists.

Ciprianek's proposal was welcomed at the group meeting. Solidarity Union advisor Galemek believed that implementing these proposals "will accelerate Poland's democratization process."

　　波兰将改革议会选举方式   
    候选人可由政党团体和建设性反对派提名    
    如有五千名选民支持也可直接提名候选人
    新华社华沙２月１８日电  波兰统一工人党中央政治局委员齐普雷尼亚克今天在这里说，下届波兰议会议员选举时不仅可由各政党、团体和建设性反对派组织提名候选人，而且还可直接由选民提名，但必须得到５０００名选民的支持。
    齐普雷尼亚克是在波兰“圆桌会议”政治改革问题小组第二次会议上讨论新选举法时透露这一消息的。他认为，这种提名办法能更好地体现民意，更具有竞争性。
    长期以来波兰议会选举采取的是由各政党、团体协商提名候选人、进行等额选举的办法。８０年代初，波兰当局把等额选举改为差额选举，但候选人提名办法仍然如旧。由选民直接提名候选人的做法无疑是一次新的尝试。
    齐普雷尼亚克建议下届议会仍由４６０名议员组成，其中１／１０议员从全国性候选人名单中选出，其余议员从各地选区候选人名单中选出。
    齐普雷尼亚克的建议在小组会上受到欢迎。团结工会顾问盖莱梅克认为落实这些建议“将加速波兰民主化进程”。
