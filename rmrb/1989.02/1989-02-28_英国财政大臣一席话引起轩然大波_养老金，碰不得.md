The phrase “event + door = political scandal” seems to have become a widely accepted expression in recent years. Not long ago, Britain also had its own “door” incident, with the central figure being British Finance Minister Nigel Lawson. This event is known as the “Lawson Gate” incident.

Nigel Lawson held a semi-annual press briefing last November, focusing on the autumn financial report. During the session, reporter Jack de Groot asked about the reform of the pension system. Lawson revealed that a new plan was in the works, with the government intending to provide additional subsidies to over a million of the poorest pensioners. In his speech, he used the phrase “establishing distribution standards.”

Two days later, this seemingly ordinary press briefing made the front page of the Sunday newspapers. According to attendees, since Lawson spoke casually and the meeting lasted only half an hour, no one bothered to take notes. However, the phrase “establishing distribution standards” caught the attention of the usually perceptive reporters. They felt the minister hinted at a reform of the pension system, possibly adopting a method similar to the economic status investigations conducted during the implementation of the Poor Law in the 1930s.

Once the news was published, Lawson's press briefing became a hot topic in the House of Commons. The opposition party launched a fierce attack on the ruling party, demanding clarification. Lawson had to explain to the MPs, emphasizing that the government had no plans to reform the pension system or conduct any economic status investigations. Instead, they were planning to increase relief for elderly people facing severe economic difficulties. He was furious with the newspaper reports, calling it “the most inaccurate, irresponsible, and nonsensical report” he had seen in his nearly 10-year career as a minister.

However, Lawson's speech in Parliament further infuriated the media. Reporters demanded the audio tape of the press briefing to verify if the phrase “establishing distribution standards” was used. Labour Party MPs also demanded that the Treasury produce the tape. The Treasury spokesman hurriedly responded, admitting that the minister's speech was recorded, but due to operational oversight, it was not recorded. For a time, both inside and outside Parliament, public outrage boiled over, with a strong push to oust Lawson.

A small press briefing caused such a big stir, all because Lawson's words touched two of the most sensitive nerves in British society.

Firstly, the pension system. Britain began implementing the pension system as early as 1908. Currently, nearly 10 million elderly people receive pensions, accounting for 1/5 of the national population. According to statistics, the ratio of taxpayers to pension recipients was 2.3:1 in 1985, and it is expected to change to 1.6:1 by 2035. Such a heavy burden, how can Britain's finances bear it? The Thatcher government implemented comprehensive social reforms in 1988, one of which was the reform of the pension system. However, due to strong resistance, it had to be postponed. This time, when Lawson mentioned the reform of the pension system again, Labour Party MPs seized the opportunity to accuse the government of being “cruel” to the elderly, while Conservative Party MPs also criticized Lawson for saying the wrong thing at the wrong time.

Secondly, “establishing distribution standards” reminded people of the economic status investigations of the 1930s. An elderly woman named Margaret Gray recalled the scene at that time: some officials implementing the Poor Law conducted economic status investigations in her home, checking her property, and insisting on listing a radio, a violin, and a homemade monochord as family luxuries. At that time, some families applying for relief had to sell their pianos in advance to obtain a relief allowance to support their families. People still have a deep fear of “economic status investigations.” Therefore, the strong reaction to Lawson's words is understandable.

After the war, Britain established a comprehensive welfare system from birth to death. Annual welfare expenditures reach $50 billion, making the state a heavily indebted nanny. Many British people have realized that this system is becoming increasingly irrational and must be reformed. However, once the reform touches the long-standing benefits that people have come to regard as their due, trouble arises. Lawson's remark stirred up a storm, reflecting one aspect of the changes in British society.

### 英国财政大臣一席话引起轩然大波  养老金，碰不得

　　英国财政大臣一席话引起轩然大波
    养老金，碰不得
    鲍世绍
    “事件＋门＝政治丑闻”，似乎已成了近年来举世公认的一种表达形式。不久前，英国也出了个“门”，“门”里的核心人物是英国财政大臣劳森，人们就称这一事件叫“劳森门”事件。
    奈杰尔·劳森去年１１月举行了半年一次的吹风会，谈话中心是秋季财政报告。其间，记者吉克·沃登问及养老金制度的改革情况。劳森透露，一项新计划正处在酝酿中，政府打算给１００多万的最穷困的养老金领取者增发补助。讲话中，他用了“制定发放标准”一语。
    两天后，这个平平常常的吹风会竟上了星期日大报的头版。据与会者回忆，鉴于劳森谈得很随便，且会议仅半小时，大家也不屑做笔记。然而“制定发放标准”一语，却引起了一向嗅觉灵敏的记者们的深思。他们觉得大臣暗示养老金制度要改革，可能采取类似３０年代英国实施济贫法时进行“经济状况调查”的方式。
    消息一发表，劳森吹风会也成了英国下议院辩论的热门题。在野党大肆攻击执政党，要求澄清真相。劳森只得向议员解释，强调政府既没有改革养老金制度的打算，也不准备作任何经济状况调查，而是正在计划对一些经济特别困难的老人增加救济。他对报纸的报道大为恼火，称这是“我当大臣近１０年生涯中所见的最不确切、最不负责任、胡言乱语的报道”。
    谁知劳森在议会的讲话又激怒了新闻界，记者们要求把吹风会的录音带拿出来对证，看是否有“制定发放标准”一语。工党议员也要求财政部出示录音带。财政部发言人急忙出来搪塞，承认大臣的讲话是录了音，但因操作疏忽，没能录上。一时间，议会内外，众怒沸腾，大有把劳森赶下台之势。
    小小吹风会，掀起如此大风波，只因劳森的话刺激了英国社会的两根最敏感的神经。
    其一，养老金制度。英国早在１９０８年就开始实行养老金制度，目前近１０００万的老人领取养老金，占全国人口的１／５。据统计，１９８５年纳税人与养老金领取者的比例是２．３∶１，到２０３５年将变为１．６∶１。这样沉重的包袱，英国财政怎么能担负得起？撒切尔政府在１９８８年推行全面社会改革，其中一项就是养老金制度的改革。但终因阻力太大，不得不推迟实施。这次劳森再次提到养老金制度的改革，工党议员趁机攻击政府对老人“残忍”，保守党议员也埋怨劳森在错误的时间说了错话。
    其二，“制定发放标准”使人联想到３０年代的“经济状况调查”。一位叫玛格丽特·格雷的老太太回忆起当时的情景：一些执行济贫法的经济状况调查人闯进她家，核查家产，硬要把一架收音机、一把小提琴和自制的独弦琴都列入家庭奢侈品。当时，一些申请救济的家庭不得不事先卖掉钢琴，以便领取一份救济金来养家糊口。对“经济状况调查”，人们至今还有谈虎色变之感。所以，大众对劳森的话反响强烈是可想而知的。
    英国在战后建立了一套从生到死无所不包的福利制度。每年的福利开支高达５００亿美元，国家成了负债累累的保姆。不少英国人已意识到这个制度越来越不合理，不改不行。然而，改革一旦触及人们长期享受、因而被视作天经地义的既得利益，麻烦就来了。劳森一语，风波迭起，正反映了英国社会变革中的一个侧面。
