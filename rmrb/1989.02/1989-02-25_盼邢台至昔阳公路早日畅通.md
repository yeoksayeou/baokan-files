The highway from Xingtai to Xiyang is a crucial transportation route connecting the provinces of Shanxi and Hebei. Last August, this highway was disrupted by floods, severely impacting the supply of coal for industrial and agricultural use in some counties and cities in Hebei. Some factories were nearly paralyzed, and the price of coal for civilian use skyrocketed. Meanwhile, coal from some mines in Shanxi accumulated in large quantities. We hope that the relevant departments will promptly repair this highway.

　　盼邢台至昔阳公路早日畅通
    邢台至昔阳的公路是沟通山西、河北两省的一条交通要道。去年八月，这条公路受洪水冲击中断，使河北一些县市的工农业用煤受到严重影响，有些工厂近于瘫痪，民用煤的价格因此成倍上涨，而山西一些煤矿的煤却大量积压。希望有关部门尽快修复这条公路。　　　　　　　山西昔阳县皋落镇　赵一鸣　张灵
