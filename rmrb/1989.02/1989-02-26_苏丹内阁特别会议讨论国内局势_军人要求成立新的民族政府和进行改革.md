    军人要求成立新的民族政府和进行改革
    新华社喀土穆２月２４日电  苏丹内阁２３日晚举行特别会议，讨论国内的复杂局势。
    ２月２１日，３００名军官签署了一份备忘录送交苏丹最高委员会和内阁，要求一周内成立新的民族政府和进行政治改革。内阁会议以后发表的一份公报说，总理迈赫迪强调，他反对独裁并期望南苏丹实现和平。
    迈赫迪说，他曾会见武装部队领导人，双方一致认为：武装部队应处于戒备状态，以便保卫国家的领土。
    迈赫迪还说，武装部队领导人强调，他们提出一周的期限并不是想威胁政权，而是想推动政府对备忘录作出反应，承担它的职责。
    迈赫迪透露，政府准备进行官方和群众两级对话，以便召开制宪会议和制止南苏丹的内战。
