Outstanding Works of Olympic Reporting by Chinese-Language Newspapers and Magazines at Home and Abroad Selected

    BEIJING, Feb. 4 (Xinhua) -- The selection of outstanding Olympic reporting works by Chinese-language newspapers and magazines at home and abroad in 1988 was announced in Beijing recently. Chen Zhiyin of the Singapore-based "Lianhe Zaobao" and Huang Weikang of the "China Sports News" won the gold awards for written reports. Lin Ximing of the Taiwan-based "Lianhe Bao" won the gold award for photography.

    This is the first time that newspapers and magazines from Taiwan have participated in a sports news excellence contest held on the mainland. Over the past two months, the organizers received nearly 400 entries from 28 Chinese-language newspapers and news agencies at home and abroad, including 213 written reports and more than 100 photographs. Nearly 10 news agencies from Taiwan sent their written and photographic works to the contest. The experts who participated in the selection carefully reviewed all the works and believed that the contest will help promote exchanges between Chinese-language newspapers and magazines at home and abroad, especially between the news community on both sides of the Taiwan Straits.

    The organizers have tentatively decided to hold an award ceremony in Guangzhou when spring comes. They will invite winners from home and abroad to attend. In addition, the winning works will be compiled into a book, for which famous painter Fan Zeng has written the title. This contest was supported by Guangzhou Restaurant, Zhujiang Beer Factory and Hong Kong "Duobiao" Magazine. The works of the reporters from the organizing units were not included in the selection.
