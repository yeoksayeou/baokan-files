	Forming New Army, Setting Up Checkpoints
	Kabul Regime Strengthens Security

	Our correspondent Ren Yujun reports from Islamabad on February 27: According to today's Pakistan "Nation" newspaper, after the complete withdrawal of Soviet troops, the Kabul regime has formed a special force known as the "revolutionary soldiers" and has intensified patrols and searches in Kabul city.

	According to the report, after Najibullah declared a state of emergency and established a military committee on the 18th, the Kabul regime decided to select core members from the "Afghan Democratic Youth League" and trade unions to form the "revolutionary soldiers" special force and to undergo rigorous training. Thus, the armed forces of the Kabul regime include: 100,000 regular troops, 250,000 militias, 350,000 secret police forces, and 300,000 armed members of the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan.

	After the withdrawal of Soviet troops, although the Kabul regime has repeatedly strengthened security measures, with tanks and armored vehicles patrolling the streets of Kabul day and night, the security situation continues to deteriorate. Currently, with the closure of the Bangladeshi embassy, out of the more than 40 diplomatic missions stationed in Kabul, 35 have either closed or left only caretakers. Now, the Kabul regime has set up checkpoints at every entrance and exit of the city, conducting strict inspections of passersby and vehicles. The authorities have also dispatched heavy troops to guard both sides of the Salang Pass to ensure the smooth passage of this supply route for food and fuel.

　　组建新军　严密设卡
    喀布尔政权加强治安
    本报伊斯兰堡２月２７日电  记者任毓骏报道：据巴基斯坦《国民报》今天消息，苏联完全撤军后，喀布尔政权又组建了一支号称“革命士兵”的特别部队，并加强了对喀布尔市的巡逻和搜查。
    据报道，纳吉布拉于１８日宣布全国进入紧急状态并成立军事委员会以后，喀布尔政权决定从“阿富汗民主青年团”和工会等组织中抽调骨干分子组成“革命士兵”特别部队，并进行严格训练。这样，喀布尔政权的武装力量有：正规军１０万人，民兵２．５万人，秘密警察部队３．５万人，武装人民民主党党员３万人。
    苏军撤离后，喀布尔政权虽然一再加强治安措施，在喀布尔街头昼夜有坦克、装甲车巡逻，但治安状况仍在恶化。目前，随着孟加拉国使馆的关闭，驻在喀布尔的４０余个外交使团中已有３５个关闭或仅留看守人员。现在，喀布尔政权已在进出喀布尔市的每一个路口设卡，对来往行人和车辆进行严格检查。当局还派重兵在萨朗公路两侧防守，以保证这条供应粮食和燃料的通道畅通。
