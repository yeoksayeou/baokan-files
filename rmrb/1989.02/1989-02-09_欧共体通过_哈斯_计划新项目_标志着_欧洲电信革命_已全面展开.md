The European Community Commission announced on February 3 that the "RACE" plan has approved 40 new projects. Together with the 48 projects that began implementation in July last year, the plan will invest more than 90% of its total budget of 1.1 billion ECUs (European Currency Units). This marks the full launch of the "European Telecommunications Revolution."

The full name of the "RACE" plan is the "European Advanced Communications Research and Development Plan." It aims to build a broadband communication network by the 21st century based on an integrated service data network that provides voice, image, and information services. This will be a telecommunications revolution that combines telecommunications and information to achieve remote information processing. The plan was introduced in 1985 and, after more than two years of deliberation and experimentation, began implementation in 1987. This plan not only involves the industrial sector but is also closely related to social and cultural issues such as strengthening cooperation among European museums and meeting the needs of the elderly and disabled. It is estimated that by the year 2000, 60% of jobs in the European Community will be related to remote information processing.

    欧共体通过“哈斯”计划新项目
    标志着“欧洲电信革命”已全面展开
    本报布鲁塞尔电　记者魏崴报道：2月3日，欧洲共同体委员会宣布，“哈斯”计划又通过40个新项目。这样，连同去年7月开始实施的48个项目，该计划将投入总预算11亿埃居（欧洲货币单位）的90％多，标志着“欧洲电信革命”已全面展开。
    “哈斯”计划全名为“欧洲先进通讯研究与发展计划”，它将以提供声音、图像和资料等综合服务的数据网为基础，在21世纪建成宽波带通信网络，这将是以电讯和信息相结合实现远程信息处理的一场电信革命。此计划于1985年出台，经过两年多的论证和试验，于1987年开始执行。这项计划不仅涉及工业领域，还同加强欧洲博物馆之间合作，满足老年人和残疾人需要等社会，文化问题紧密相关。预计到2000年，欧共体60％的就业岗位将和远程信息处理有关。
