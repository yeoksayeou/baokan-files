Zaire Explores the Path of Reform

By Yang Rusheng, Correspondent

Compared to other African countries, Zaire can be considered "rich in resources." Its forest area is 1.25 billion hectares, accounting for more than half of its national territory. It is abundant in various precious woods and is known as the "lungs of the Earth." It is also the "treasure chest of Central Africa," rich in various mineral resources. Its annual copper production is around 500,000 tons, ranking fifth in the world. Its cobalt production accounts for 60% of the world's total production, making it the world's largest producer. Cobalt is an important strategic resource, and most of the cobalt needed by Western countries comes from Zaire. Its industrial diamond production ranks second in the world. Additionally, it has gold, zinc, manganese, tin, tantalum, germanium, tungsten, cadmium, nickel, and other rare metals. Zaire's water and fishery resources are also very rich. All of these provide extremely favorable conditions for Zaire's economic development.

However, after independence, Zaire's economic development has taken a tortuous path. In the early years, due to the implementation of a liberalized market economy and preferential policies for foreign investment, the economy experienced a period of prosperity, with the national GDP growing steadily at a rate of 7% for several years. But in the 1980s, due to the decline in international market prices for copper and cobalt, Zaire's export earnings plummeted, leading to severe economic difficulties. In 1986, Zaire's export earnings lost $400 million, and in 1987, they decreased by another 10% compared to 1986. Meanwhile, the prices of imported industrial products were rising sharply, resulting in a trade deficit, increasing debt burden, and now reaching over $70 billion. Zaire has become a net exporter of capital, with an empty treasury, financial difficulties, soaring prices, and overall economic difficulties.

To overcome the economic crisis and explore the path to revival, the Zaire government, in cooperation with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, began structural adjustments and reforms five years ago. The Zaire government first rectified state-owned and joint-venture enterprises that were poorly managed. The Executive Committee signed "contract plans" with these enterprises, clearly stipulating the selection criteria, authority, and responsibilities of enterprise managers, as well as the goals to be achieved within five years. Last year, it signed such contracts with more than a dozen enterprises. For other enterprises, it gradually implemented privatization, selling all or part of the state-owned shares, and vigorously developing private small and medium-sized enterprises.

Zaire also promulgated a new investment law, established a preferential investment system, relaxed foreign exchange controls, and allowed foreign companies to remit their profits abroad. It strictly controlled limited foreign loans and implemented a foreign exchange quota system. Zaire also reformed its financial system, revised its tax laws, devalued its currency significantly, tightened fiscal policy, greatly reduced government expenditures, and reduced the number of official trips. To increase exports, it abolished export taxes and administrative inspection procedures for all products except logs, oil, mineral products, and coffee, and delegated the issuance of export permits and approvals to commercial banks. Zaire also enacted laws and established financial supervision agencies to prevent officials from engaging in corruption and smuggling, and adjusted and reorganized the leadership of the customs and tax departments.

Another aspect of Zaire's policy adjustments is to strengthen the agricultural sector. In the new five-year plan (1986-1990), agriculture has been given priority for development, aiming to achieve self-sufficiency in grain and meat, and to vigorously develop forest resources and economic crops. It has selected 37 counties as key counties for agricultural development, with the government providing special support in agricultural machinery, fertilizers, seeds, and technical training. Due to the liberalization of agricultural product prices, farmers' enthusiasm for production has been stimulated, and agricultural and sideline products are abundant, with free markets being very active. In Bukavu, the capital of South Kivu Province, the reporter saw hills covered with cassava, beans, cotton, and bananas. Groups of farmers carried agricultural products to the city for sale.

Overall, Zaire's reform measures are in line with its national conditions and have achieved some results. The national budget for 1987 was basically balanced, and the tax situation last year was better than in previous years, showing signs of economic improvement. The Zaire government is determined to reform the economic system. Although the road ahead is not smooth, Zaire is rich in resources, has a certain industrial foundation, and a stable domestic political situation. There is hope for Zaire to return to the path of revival.

　　扎伊尔探索改革之路
    本报记者  杨汝生
    与非洲其他国家相比，扎伊尔称得上“地大物博”。它的森林面积为一点二五亿公顷，占全国领土的一半以上。各种名贵木材尤多，被称为“地球之肺”。它还是中非的“万宝箱”，蕴藏着极其丰富的各种矿藏。它的铜产量每年都有五十万吨左右，占世界第五位，钴产量占世界总产量的百分之六十，为世界第一。钴为重要的战略物资，西方国家所需要的钴主要来自扎。工业用钻石产量为世界第二。此外它还有黄金、锌、锰、锡、钽、锗、钨、镉、镍等稀有金属。扎伊尔的水利和渔业资源同样十分丰富。所有这些，都给扎伊尔的经济发展提供了极为有利的条件。
    然而，扎伊尔在独立之后，经济发展却走过一条曲折的道路。在最初的几年里，由于实行自由化的市场经济，对外资采取优惠政策，经济出现繁荣发展局面，国民生产总值连续几年以百分之七的速度稳定增长。但进入八十年代以后，由于铜和钴的国际市场价格下跌，扎伊尔的出口收入剧减，国家经济面临严重困难。一九八六年扎伊尔的出口收入损失了四亿美元，一九八七年又比一九八六年减少了百分之十。与此同时，扎进口的工业产品价格却在直线上升，致使外贸出现逆差，债务负担日重，现已达七十多亿美元，扎伊尔成了纯资金出口国，国库亏空，财政拮据，物价昂贵，扎伊尔经济遇到了全面的困难。
    为了渡过经济难关，探索振兴之路，早在五年之前，扎政府便与国际货币基金组织和世界银行合作，对经济进行结构性的调整和改革。扎政府首先对经营不善的国营和合营企业进行整顿，扎执委会同这些企业分别签订“合同计划”，明确规定企业负责人的人选标准、权限和义务，以及五年内应达到的目标等。去年，它已与十几个企业签订了这种合同。对另外一些企业则逐步实行私营化，将国家占有的股份全部或部分出让，并大力发展私人中小企业。
    扎伊尔还颁布了新的投资法，设立优惠投资体制，放宽外汇管理，允许外国公司将所获利润汇出。对有限的外国贷款进行严格控制，实行外汇配额制度。扎还改革金融，修订税制，将扎币大幅度贬值，紧缩财政，大大压缩政府开支，减少公职人员的出访活动等。为增加出口，规定除原木、石油、矿产品和咖啡外，一律取消出口税和行政检查手续，出口证和签发权下放到商业银行。扎还制订法律，设立财政监察机构，以制止官员的营私舞弊和走私，并调整和改组了海关和税务部门的领导人。
    扎调整政策的另一个方面是加强农业部门，在新的五年计划（一九八六—一九九○）中，把农业放在优先发展的地位上，力争实现粮食和肉类自给，并大力开发森林资源，发展经济作物。它已选择了三十七个县作为发展农业生产的重点县，政府在农机、化肥、种子和技术培训方面给以特殊照顾。由于放开了农产品价格，调动了农民的生产积极性，农副产品产量丰富，自由市场异常活跃。在南基伍省省会布卡武，记者看到山山岭岭都种满木薯、豆类、棉花和香蕉等。一群群农民头顶农产品到城里出售。
    总的看来，扎伊尔的这些改革措施是符合本国国情的，并已取得某些成效。一九八七年的国家预算收支基本平衡，去年的税收情况也好于往年，国民经济出现好转的征兆。扎政府改革经济体制的决心是大的。尽管前进的道路不平坦，但扎伊尔资源丰富，又具备一定的工业基础，加之国内政局稳定，扎伊尔重新走上复兴之路是有希望的。
