Despite Prohibitions, Feasts Continue for Project Completion

The completion inspection of the 682 Oil Depot renovation project by the Changjiang Steamship Company's Wuhan Fuel Station was held on November 25, 1988. Participating units included relevant departments of Wuhan City and the Changjiang Steamship Company, totaling 21 units, with 8 vehicles of various sizes. To avoid the station's staff, the attendees had lunch at the Qunai Restaurant in Huashan Town, Hongshan District, Wuhan, on the same day. There were 11 tables for lunch, each costing 100 yuan, and 11 tables for dinner, each costing 130 yuan. The Wuhan Fuel Station also purchased cigarettes, high-grade grape wine, and pineapple cans, totaling 955.57 yuan. To ensure the smooth completion of the project, relevant leaders also hosted banquets at other venues, with 5 tables costing 514.63 yuan.

On November 30, the Finance and Accounting Department of the Wuhan Fuel Station, without receiving any receipts, listed 5,000 yuan for the conference fee under the special fund project expenditure. Later, the 682 Oil Depot transferred 5,100 yuan in two installments via bank to the Qunai Restaurant. The total expenditure for this inspection was 4,000 yuan. The person in charge, Cheng Guoqing, had the Qunai Restaurant issue a fake receipt and withdrew 1,100 yuan in cash.

We believe that the relevant departments should seriously investigate and handle this matter.

　　有禁不止顶着上  大摆酒宴搞验收
    交通部长江轮船总公司武汉燃料站６８２油库改造工程，于１９８８年１１月２５日组织竣工验收。参加单位有武汉市有关部门、长江轮船总公司等２１个单位，动用大小车８辆。为了避开本单位群众，与会人员当日中午，在武汉市洪山区花山镇联丰村群爱餐馆进餐，共１１桌，每桌１００元；晚餐１１桌，每桌１３０元。武汉燃料站还购香烟、高级葡萄酒、菠萝罐头等，开支９５５．５７元。为了工程顺利验收，有关领导还在其它场合设宴５桌，开支５１４．６３元。
    １１月３０日，武汉燃料站财会科在未收到收款收据的情况下，将５０００元会议费列入专用基金工程支出。此后，６８２油库分两次通过银行将５１００元支票转给群爱餐馆。这次验收开支共４０００元，经办人程国庆在结帐时，让群爱餐馆开出假收据，领取现金１１００元。
    我们认为，有关部门应严肃查处这件事。
