Edition: 3

The "Selected Works of Li Xiannian" includes 94 important works by Li Xiannian from June 1935 to February 1988, of which 75 are published for the first time. This collection is a reflection of the author's unremitting struggle for the liberation and happiness of the Chinese people over the past 60 years. Readers can see from this work how Li Xiannian, in various periods of China's revolution and construction, combined Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought with the actual situation at the time and place, and successfully completed various tasks assigned by the Party and the state. The author's practical experience in struggling in various complex environments and his important views in politics, military affairs, economics, and other fields are vivid examples of the creative application of Mao Zedong Thought.

According to the historical process and the author's experience, the content of this collection can be roughly divided into three periods.

The first period is from the Long March of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army to the national liberation. There are 25 articles from this period included in the collection. These works show how the author, starting from the specific situation at the time and place, correctly applied Mao Zedong's theories and policies on armed struggle and the united front, achieving success.

"The Two Telegrams After the Meeting of the First and Fourth Red Armies" is a telegram sent by Li Xiannian, who led the vanguard of the Fourth Red Army to welcome the Central Committee of the Party and the First Red Army to achieve the historic meeting of the two main forces of the Red Army. It reflects, from one side, the two historic events of strategic significance: the meeting of the First and Fourth Red Armies during the Long March and the decision to march north. The three telegrams in "The Struggles of the Western Route Army" are precious documents reflecting the arduous struggles of the remnants of the Western Route Army. Starting from the end of October 1936, under the command of Xu Xiangqian and Chen Changhao, the Western Route Army fought fiercely in the Hexi Corridor, annihilating more than 20,000 enemy troops, but ultimately failed due to being outnumbered and other reasons. Li Xiannian, in a critical moment, took command of the military affairs of the remnants of the Western Route Army. With a firm communist belief and unwavering confidence, he and other comrades resolutely led a brigade to cross the Qilian Mountains, traverse the Gobi Desert, endure hardships, and arrived at Xingxingxia at the end of April 1937, preserving a batch of combat cadres for the Party. At that time, Chen Yun and Teng Daiyuan, representatives of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in Xinjiang, welcomed them to Di Hua (now Urumqi City).

During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Party and army of the E-Yu Border Area, with Li Xiannian as the main leader, were isolated in the enemy's rear, facing the joint attacks of the Japanese, puppet, and traitorous forces, with complex contradictions and arduous struggles. Under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Party and the Central Plains Bureau with Liu Shaoqi as the secretary, they deeply mobilized and closely relied on the anti-Japanese people of various strata, successfully creating a vast anti-Japanese base and a powerful revolutionary armed force of strategic significance in the Central Plains region. The 18 works from this period included in the collection reflect this victorious struggle.

"Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Warfare in the E-Yu Border Area," "Telegram from the Entire Leadership of the New Fourth Army's Fifth Division Taking Office," and "Advancing into Southern Hubei" summarize the process of the E-Yu Advance Column developing from a small armed force into the New Fourth Army's Fifth Division, and the continuous expansion and consolidation of the E-Yu Border Anti-Japanese Base. "The Facts of the E-Yu Advance Column's All-Out Resistance to Japan Are Indisputable," "Avoiding Armed Confrontations with the Nationalist Army as Much as Possible," and "Crushing the New Offensive of the Nationalist Anti-Communist Army" reflect the author's experience in correctly handling the relationship between maintaining the united front and insisting on the principle of independence and self-reliance, using different methods to win over and struggle against various factions of the Nationalist Party. "Strict Military Discipline" and "The Characteristics and Tasks of Revolutionary Soldiers" are important speeches by the author on strengthening the political and organizational discipline of the troops based on the special situation of independent operations in a dispersed environment and the requirements for building a revolutionary army led by the Party. "The Struggles of the E-Yu Border Area in 1943" and "Expanding and Consolidating Local Armed Forces" summarize the main experiences of anti-"sweeping" struggles and the development of people's war. The author, based on the characteristics of the anti-Japanese war in the Central Plains, proposed utilizing the contradictions between the Japanese, puppet, and traitorous forces, utilizing the advantages of mountainous and lake terrain, fully developing local armed forces, launching people's war, and adopting the tactics of using dispersed forces against concentrated forces and concentrated forces against dispersed forces to strike the Japanese and puppet armies.

"Breaking Through the Central Plains" and other 5 articles after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan record the historical facts of the struggle of the Central Plains Military Region troops, led by Li Xiannian as the commander, to fight against the Nationalist Party troops in a tit-for-tat manner according to the instructions of the Central Committee of the Party and Chairman Mao, to break through the siege of 300,000 enemy troops, to create new bases, and to command the dispersed operations of our various troops to persist in guerrilla warfare, to implement strategic persistence and strategic transfer, and to participate in the great struggle of the strategic counteroffensive with a part of the main force joining the Liu-Deng Army.

The second period is from national liberation to 1954. During this period, the author held important leadership positions in the Party, government, and military in Hubei Province and in the Central South region. There are 18 works from this period included in the collection, mainly reflecting the author's meticulous analysis and grasp of the characteristics of the region, the correct implementation of various policies of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Central People's Government, and the effective work and new experiences gained in continuing to complete the tasks left over from the new democratic revolution, achieving the recovery and development of the national economy, establishing and consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship, and preparing for socialist transformation and industrialization.

"The Current Central Task is to Suppress Bandits and Tyrants" and "The Characteristics of Hubei and Current Policies" thoroughly analyze the political, economic characteristics, and social situation of Hubei Province, and based on the instructions of the Central Plains Bureau, expound the policy of focusing on rural areas for a certain period while also considering urban areas, guiding various places to seize the opportunity and step by step to carry out various tasks such as suppressing bandits and tyrants, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and land reform, thereby laying a solid foundation for socialist transformation and urban democratic reform. "Strengthening the Construction of Political Power" and "Strengthening United Front Work" mainly explain the relationship between the Party's leadership and political power, the relationship between strengthening the united front and consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship. The articles propose distinguishing the different functions of the Party's leadership and political power, changing the practice of the Party replacing the government; propose that strengthening the united front is an important aspect of political power construction, and stipulate the three principles and various specific measures of united front work. It is very valuable to clearly propose these important views in the early 1950s. In "Insisting on the Party's Policy Towards Intellectuals" and "Correctly Implementing the Party's Policies and Strategies," the author, based on the situation and tasks at the time, correctly explains various policies, especially with foresight, discusses the Party's policy towards intellectuals. He clearly proposes that intellectuals are wealth, and the construction of New China cannot do without them. Disdaining them is the consciousness of backward peasants, which will harm the interests of the Party. "Shifting the Work Focus to Economic Construction" comprehensively evaluates the work of Wuhan City, analyzes the social conditions of Wuhan City implementing production as the center, explains the relationship between economic construction and consolidating political power and political reform, and clearly proposes shifting the work focus to economic construction. The author calls on the broad cadres to change their minds, to learn economic construction, this complex science, just like learning military affairs during the war years. "The Fundamental Purpose of Socialist Transformation is to Develop Social Productive Forces" and "Better Implementing the Party's General Line and General Task" are two speeches at the beginning of implementing the general line for the transitional period. The author proposes that achieving agricultural cooperation should adhere to the principles of demonstration and voluntariness, correctly implement the policy of utilizing, restricting, and transforming capitalist industry and commerce, achieve industrialization while building a powerful heavy industry, and correspondingly develop other economic undertakings to coordinate and proportionally develop with heavy industry, avoiding economic life disconnection and chaos. The speeches emphasize one key point, that is, socialist transformation should take the development of productive forces as the fundamental purpose, and the entire economy should develop steadily and steadily according to the plan.

The third period is after 1954. There are 51 works from this period included in the collection, accounting for most of the book, and concentrating on the author's main views on construction and reform based on China's national conditions.

From September 1954 to before the "Cultural Revolution," Li Xiannian successively held the positions of member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, secretary of the Secretariat, vice premier of the State Council, minister of the Financial and Trade Office, minister of Finance, and deputy director of the State Planning Commission. The 19 works from this stage basically reflect his participation in the leadership of socialist transformation and socialist construction in the central government, and his important views and suggestions to the central government on continuously summarizing experience, exploring laws in planning, finance, banking, commerce, foreign trade, and other aspects, and correcting the mistakes of the "Great Leap Forward," overcoming the difficulties of the three years, and leading the adjustment of the national economy.

"The Strengthening of Leadership in Commercial Work and the Transformation of Private Business" is a report by the author in April 1954 to Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai and the Central Committee. The report, on the serious situation of the progress of private business transformation being too fast, causing public-private relations and the relationship between the state and farmers to be relatively tense, proposes improvement opinions. He proposes that in the situation where the supply of industrial and agricultural products has been controlled by the state economy, socialist commerce on the urban retail front should make necessary concessions, allowing all retail merchants to continue their operations, and then transforming private businesses through various forms. The transformation of rural small merchants and peddlers should be based on the principle of voluntariness, gradually transitioning to cooperative commerce or establishing procurement and sales links with cooperatives. After completing the procurement task, farmers' surplus products should be allowed to be freely bought and sold according to the principle of market management, restoring the original markets in rural areas and opening up a few markets in cities. The supply should also try to meet the needs of farmers and provide convenience to them.

"The Summary of the Financial and Trade Work Report to the Central Committee" is one of the reports heard by Mao Zedong before writing the article "On Ten Major Relationships." This report was praised by Mao Zedong and distributed to the central and local responsible comrades. The report emphasizes that financial work should implement the policy of full revenue and tight expenditure, and also proposes two important views on adjusting the relationship between the state and enterprises, and between the central and local governments, and mobilizing the enthusiasm of all parties. When discussing the issue of improving enterprise financial management to mobilize the enthusiasm of enterprises, the author points out that the current practice of the state implementing unified collection and expenditure for enterprises is not conducive to enterprises caring about the completion of the state plan from the perspective of material interests. Therefore, he suggests appropriately expanding the authority of financial management of responsible persons in various enterprise departments, actively preparing for the implementation of the profit-sharing system for enterprises, so that the expenditure of enterprises is combined with income, to mobilize the enthusiasm of enterprises to increase income and save expenditure. When discussing the issue of appropriately expanding the authority of local financial management to mobilize the enthusiasm of local governments, the author, aiming at the shortcomings of various central departments managing local governments too much, too detailed, and too centralized, clearly proposes that it is necessary to appropriately expand the authority and flexibility of local governments in financial management. Therefore, the planning system and the management system of various departments should be correspondingly changed. These opinions point out that certain shortcomings have begun to appear in the socialist economic system established rapidly in China, and propose solutions to the problem of excessive centralization.

"Production and Other Undertakings Must Be Based on a Solid Foundation" is an important and relatively early speech proposing to correct the rash and impetuous tendency in 1956. The author emphasizes that the current economic construction has the shortcomings of pursuing more and faster, not paying attention to better and saving, and proposes that the development of production and other undertakings must be based on a solid foundation, and suggests making necessary and reasonable adjustments to the basic construction plan. In view of the lessons of economic construction in 1956, in January 1957, Chen Yun proposed the important view that the scale of construction should be adapted to national strength and that finance, credit, and materials must be balanced. Li Xiannian fully agrees with Chen Yun's opinion and, in the article "Finance, Credit, and Materials Must Be Unified and Balanced," elaborates on this view in detail. He summarizes the lessons of several rash tendencies in the execution of the state budget and credit plan in 1956, discusses the necessity and importance of maintaining the unity and balance of finance, credit, and materials, points out that this is an objective law that must be followed in socialist economic construction, and proposes several specific boundaries for achieving the balance of the three, and preliminarily summarizes several basic experiences of socialist economic construction.

"The Relaxation of Market Tension, the Development of Secondary Food and Handicraft Production," "Current Problems and Adjustment Measures in Finance and Banking," "Letter to Mao Zedong on the Grain Problem," and "Problems in Market Prices and Currency Circulation and Methods to Overcome Difficulties" are four important works by the author under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Party to correct the mistakes of the "Great Leap Forward" and the people's commune movement, overcome economic difficulties, and participate in the leadership of the adjustment of the national economy. This reflects his arduous efforts in the context of the dominant "leftist" ideology. In the first article, the author, aiming at the various tensions and imbalances caused by the rash and impetuous style during the "Great Leap Forward," proposes a series of policy measures to vigorously increase the production of secondary food, restore and develop handicraft industries, reduce the number of workers, compress the purchasing power of social groups, and prohibit the expansion of currency issuance without a commodity base. The second article is a report to the Central Committee during the Lushan Conference. He, facing the false reporting in financial and economic work, realistically points out that the financial surplus in 1958 did not actually exist, the bank credit expenditure was greater than the income, some more tickets were issued, and the above situation continued to develop in 1959, and the grain inventory decreased significantly. Therefore, he proposed adjustment suggestions to the Central Committee. In the third article, the author specifically and in detail analyzes the sharp contradictions and serious difficulties caused by the false reporting and high targets in the grain problem, weighs the pros and cons, and repeatedly considers, proposing the plan to import 10 billion jin of grain in 1962, reduce 4 billion jin of procurement grain, and reduce the urban population by a considerable number. In the fourth article, the author more clearly points out that the main problems in market prices and currency circulation are: 3-4 billion yuan more tickets were issued, the supply of commodities is 4-5 billion yuan less than the purchasing power, prices have risen by more than 20%, and the financial deficit has been more than 3 billion yuan for two consecutive years. Therefore, he proposes 6 measures, especially proposing to stabilize the prices and fees of 18 categories of goods that account for 60% of workers' living expenses, and not to raise them. The Central Committee agrees with Li Xiannian's opinion and transmits his report to the country for implementation.

Starting in 1963, China's national economy began to fully recover, and the Central Committee decided to continue the adjustment for another three years and carried out some exploratory reforms of the economic system. In the two important works "Several Opinions on Current Economic Work" and "Regulations and Systems That Restrict the Development of Productive Forces Must Be Resolutely Changed," the author emphasizes that the national economy must take agriculture as the foundation, strengthen the basic industry, and handle the relationship between accumulation and consumption; clearly points out the problems existing in financial and banking work and the necessity of reforming regulations and systems, and points out that the fundamental purpose of reform is to develop production rapidly, efficiently, and economically. Therefore, anything that restricts productive forces and is not conducive to production development must be resolutely and thoroughly changed. The author also, based on the spirit of establishing before destroying, proposes the idea of financial work reform and the 10 boundaries that should be guarded during the reform.

A set of comments and two speeches included in the collection during the "Cultural Revolution" reflect, from several aspects, Li Xiannian's efforts to assist Premier Zhou Enlai in presiding over the economic work of the State Council under extremely difficult conditions, to reduce the losses caused by political turmoil, and to arrange production and people's lives; reflect his efforts in 1975 to assist Deng Xiaoping in fighting against the Jiang Qing counter-revolutionary clique, promoting stability and unity, and developing the national economy.

In 1976, in the struggle to smash the Jiang Qing counter-revolutionary clique, Li Xiannian played an important role. After that, he successively held the positions of vice chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee, and chairman of the state. The 29 works from this stage included in the collection reflect his important opinions on participating in guiding the Party to achieve a historic great turn and the work of economic adjustment, reform, and opening up in the new historical period.

"Attaching Importance to Socialist Commodity Production and Circulation" is part of a speech at the National Financial and Trade Conference in June 1978. The author discusses the role of commodity production and the law of value in the socialist economy and the significance of doing a good job in financial and trade work. Among the leaders of our Party, this is an article that relatively early reaffirms the role of commodity production and the law of value, which has had a positive impact on the subsequent reform.

In "Speech at the State Council's Meeting on Practical Matters," the author once again emphasizes that the development of the national economy must follow the objective economic laws, do a good job in comprehensive balance, and handle the major proportionate relationships of the national economy. The speech proposes the tasks of reforming the planning, financial, material, domestic and foreign trade systems, and enterprise management system, and emphasizes that it is necessary to give enterprises a certain degree of independence and management power to mobilize the enthusiasm of enterprises. The speech also systematically expounds on the relationship between doing a good job in technological introduction and improving self-reliance, pointing out that we must actively introduce and digest and absorb, creating new things. He said that the four modernizations cannot be bought, and the idea of wanting to buy everything and keep buying is a lazy thought that will never realize modernization. He also, based on the experience of several years of introduction work, proposed 9 principles to be followed when determining introduction projects. These principles still have practical significance today.

"The Speech at the Central Work Conference" is an important speech in April 1979, representing the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council to propose the policy of adjustment, reform, rectification, and improvement. The speech, facing the serious imbalance of the proportionate relationships of the national economy caused by the long-term interference and sabotage of Lin Biao and the "Gang of Four," and some mistakes in economic work after the smashing of the "Gang of Four," expounds on the necessity of adjusting the national economy, the main tasks and principles and measures of adjustment, and the guiding ideology of realizing the four modernizations and the issue of reforming the economic management system. The speech points out that we must modernize from China's national conditions and walk a path of modernization under the socialist system. The speech specially discusses the issue of reforming the economic management system, pointing out that the current economic management system has many drawbacks and must be gradually reformed, and on the relationship between planning guidance and market regulation, expanding enterprise autonomy, clarifying the management authority of the central and local governments, and using economic means to manage the economy, expounds on the principles and direction of reform.

"The Speech at the National Planning Conference," "Several Opinions on Economic Adjustment Work," and "Arranging Economic Development Speed Must Be Realistic" are three important works to implement economic adjustment. The author once again expounds on the important views of economic construction to proceed in an orderly manner, to act according to one's ability, and to avoid blindly stirring things up. He points out that the people hope for faster construction speed, but they also require no more disturbances. Because the economic development goes up and down, goes up very fiercely, and falls very sharply, not only does it cause great losses, but it also takes several years to recover. At the same time, he also specifically expounds on the boundary of "ability" in acting according to one's ability, which is to first ensure simple reproduction and then arrange for expanded reproduction. He points out that this is an important experience summarized by our Party through many years of practice, and violating it will lead to failure.

"The Basic Construction of Farmland Must Not Be Relaxed" expounds on the relationship between realizing agricultural modernization and carrying out the basic construction of farmland. The author points out that without carrying out the basic construction of farmland and striving for high and stable yields in agriculture, the problem of China's agriculture passing the test cannot be solved, and agricultural modernization cannot be realized. The basic construction of farmland must be carried out according to objective laws, must adhere to a scientific attitude, must be adapted to local conditions, must emphasize practical results, and must be mutually beneficial, and cannot be leveled and adjusted. At present, the basic construction of farmland mainly relies on the labor accumulation of farmers.

"The Reform and Opening-Up Policy Is in Accordance with China's National Conditions" is a draft of several talks given by the author to foreign guests in the first half of 1987. In the talks, he summarizes several important experiences since the reform and opening up, pointing out that our goal is to build socialism with Chinese characteristics, and we cannot copy foreign practices or follow old rules, but must boldly explore and find a path of building socialism that suits our own national conditions. Reform is the self-improvement and development of the socialist system, and opening up is mainly to learn advanced science and technology and management experience from abroad and to utilize some foreign capital. The author believes that, after all, reform and opening up are to strengthen the construction of socialist material and spiritual civilization in China. Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, reform and opening up have achieved great results, and the people support it. Anything supported by the people will not change and cannot be changed. Reform and opening up must handle the relationship between planning and market, and the development of commodity economy is generally to develop a socialist commodity economy based on public ownership and planned. In the reform, it is necessary to allow and encourage a part of the people who work hard and work well to get rich first, but our goal is common prosperity, and we must not allow polarization. Ensuring that 10 billion people can have enough food is still a basic state policy. The reform must decentralize power from the overall perspective, but some power must be held by the state and cannot be decentralized for everything; it is necessary to avoid the loss of control of construction, consumption, and prices. Reform and opening up and adhering to the four cardinal principles are inseparable, are unified, and can and should be coordinated and developed. It is necessary to adhere to self-reliance and pay attention to resisting the corrupt thoughts and styles of the bourgeoisie, to improve social customs and social order. It is necessary to adhere to and improve the leadership of the Party, adapt to the needs of reform and opening up, and at the same time adhere to the good traditions of the Party, etc.

The publication of "Selected Works of Li Xiannian" is of great significance for studying and summarizing the historical experience of China's revolution and construction, and promoting the development of China's socialist modernization and reform.

　　《李先念文选》重要篇目介绍
    《李先念文选》收入了李先念同志从１９３５年６月至１９８８年２月的重要著作９４篇，其中７５篇是第一次公开发表。这部文选，是作者在过去６０多年中，为谋求中国人民解放和幸福而不懈奋斗的一个缩影。读者从这部著作中可以看到，李先念在中国革命和建设的各个时期，把马列主义、毛泽东思想同当时当地的实际情况相结合，出色地完成党和国家赋予的各项任务。作者在各种复杂环境中奋斗的实践经验，和他在政治、军事、经济等方面的重要观点，是创造性地运用毛泽东思想的生动体现。
    按照历史的进程和作者的经历，这部文选的内容大体分为三个时期。
    第一个时期是从中国工农红军长征到全国解放。收入文选的这个时期的著作有２５篇。这些著作，表明作者从当时、当地的具体情况出发，正确地运用毛泽东关于武装斗争和统一战线的理论、政策所取得的成功。
    《红军一、四方面军会师后的两份电报》是李先念率领红四方面军先头部队，迎接党中央和红一方面军实现两大主力红军会师后，发给朱德和中华苏维埃中央革命军事委员会的。它从一个侧面反映了红军长征中一、四方面军会师和决策北上这两个具有战略意义的历史事件。《西路军的斗争》的三份电报，是反映红军西路军余部艰苦斗争的珍贵文献。１９３６年１０月底开始，在徐向前、陈昌浩的指挥下，西路军在河西走廊浴血奋战，歼敌两万余人，但终因寡不敌众和其他原因而失败。李先念临危受命，负责西路军余部的军事指挥。他以坚定的共产主义信念和必胜的信心，和其他同志一起，毅然率领一个支队翻越祁连山，穿过戈壁滩，历尽艰辛，于１９３７年４月底到达星星峡，为党保存了一批战斗骨干。当时正在新疆的中共中央代表陈云、滕代远将他们迎往迪化（今乌鲁木齐市）。
    抗日战争时期，以李先念为主要领导的鄂豫边区党和军队，孤悬敌后，面临日伪顽夹击，矛盾错综复杂，斗争艰难残酷。他们在党中央和以刘少奇为书记的中原局的领导下，深入发动和紧密依靠各阶层的抗日人民，终于在具有重要战略意义的中原地区，成功地创建了纵横千里的抗日根据地和强大的革命武装力量。收入文选的这个时期１８篇著作，反映了这一胜利的斗争。
    《豫鄂边区的抗日游击战争》、《率新四军第五师全体将领就职通电》、《挺进鄂南》等文，概述了豫鄂挺进纵队从一支很小的武装逐步发展为新四军第五师，和鄂豫边抗日根据地不断扩大、巩固的过程。《豫鄂挺进纵队全力抗日的事实无可置辩》、《尽量避免与国民党军武装冲突》、《粉碎国民党反共军队的新进攻》等文，反映了作者正确处理坚持统一战线同坚持独立自主原则的关系，运用不同方式，对国民党各派势力进行争取和斗争的经验。《严正军风》、《革命军人的特点与任务》，是作者根据部队在分散环境下独立活动的特殊情况，和建设党领导的革命军队的要求，对加强部队政治思想和组织纪律建设的重要讲话。《一九四三年鄂豫边区的斗争》、《扩大和巩固地方武装》，总结了反“扫荡”斗争和开展人民战争的主要经验。作者根据中原地区抗日战争的特点，提出利用日伪顽之间的矛盾，利用山地、湖泊等有利的地理条件，充分发展地方武装，开展人民战争，以及采用以分散对集中、以集中对分散的办法打击日伪军的战术原则。
    《中原突围》等抗战胜利后的５篇文章，记述了以李先念为司令员的中原军区部队，根据党中央和毛主席的指示，同国民党部队进行针锋相对的斗争，突破３０万敌军的包围，创建新的根据地，并指挥分散活动的我各路部队坚持游击战争，实行战略坚持、战略转移的斗争史实，以及一部主力编入刘邓大军投入战略反攻的伟大斗争的史实。
    第二个时期是从全国解放到１９５４年。在此期间，作者在湖北省担任党政军主要领导工作，在中南地区担任重要领导工作。收入文选的这个时期的著作共１８篇，主要反映作者周密分析和掌握本地区的特点，正确执行中共中央和中央人民政府的各项方针政策，为继续完成新民主主义革命遗留的任务，实现国民经济的恢复和发展，建立和巩固人民民主政权，以及为准备社会主义改造和工业化建设，所进行的卓有成效的工作和取得的新经验。
    《剿匪反霸是当前的中心任务》、《湖北的特点和当前的政策》两篇著作，透彻地分析了湖北省的政治、经济特点和社会情况，根据华中局的指示，阐述了在一定时间内仍把工作重点放在农村并兼顾城市的方针，指导各地不失时机地、有步骤地开展剿匪反霸、镇压反革命、土地改革等各项工作，从而为社会主义改造和城市民主改革打下了坚实的基础。《加强政权建设》、《加强统一战线工作》，主要是阐明党的领导和政权的关系、加强统一战线和巩固人民民主专政的关系。文章提出了要分清党的领导和政权的不同职能，改变以党代政的做法；提出加强统一战线是政权建设的重要方面，规定了统战工作的三项原则和各项具体措施。在５０年代初期就明确提出这些重要观点，是很可贵的。在《坚持执行党的知识分子政策》和《正确执行党的政策与策略》等著作中，作者根据当时的情况和任务，正确阐明了各方面的政策，特别是富有远见地论述了党的知识分子政策。他明确提出知识分子是财富，新中国的建设离不开他们，鄙视他们是落后农民的意识，会危害党的利益。《把工作重点转移到经济建设上来》一文，全面估价了武汉市的工作，分析了武汉市实行以生产为中心的社会条件，阐明了经济建设和巩固政权、政治改革的关系，明确提出把工作重点转移到经济建设上来。作者号召广大干部在思想上来一个转变，要像战争年代学习军事一样，学会经济建设这门复杂的科学。《社会主义改造的根本目的是发展社会生产力》、《更好地贯彻党的总路线和总任务》，是开始贯彻执行过渡时期总路线的两篇讲话。作者提出，实现农业合作化要坚持示范和自愿的原则，对资本主义工商业要正确贯彻利用、限制、改造的方针，实现工业化要在建设强大的重工业的同时，相应地发展其他经济事业，使之与重工业协调地按比例地发展，避免招致经济生活的脱节和混乱。讲话贯彻一个着重点，即社会主义改造要以发展生产力为根本目的，整个经济要有计划地稳步地向前发展。
    第三个时期是１９５４年以后。收入文选的这一时期的著作有５１篇，占本书的大部分，集中反映了作者从中国国情出发进行建设与改革的主要观点。
    从１９５４年９月到“文化大革命”前，李先念先后任中共中央政治局委员、书记处书记、国务院副总理兼财贸办公室主任、财政部部长、国家计委副主任等职。这一阶段的１９篇著作，基本上反映了他在中央参与社会主义改造和社会主义建设的领导工作，在计划、财政、金融、商业、外贸等方面不断总结经验、探索规律所提出的重要见解，和为纠正“大跃进”的错误、战胜三年困难，参与领导国民经济调整等方面向中央提出的重要建议。
    《加强对商业工作和私商改造工作的领导》一文，是作者１９５４年４月给毛泽东、周恩来并中央的报告。报告就对私商改造进展太快，造成公私关系、国家和农民的关系比较紧张的严重情况，提出了改进意见。他提出，在工农业产品的货源已为国营经济掌握的情况下，城市零售阵地上的社会主义商业应作必要的退让，使所有零售商能够继续经营，然后通过各种形式对私商加以改造。对农村小商小贩的改造应根据自愿的原则，逐步过渡为供销合作社商业或与供销社建立代购代销联系。统购任务完成后农民的多余产品，应根据市场管理原则，允许农民自由买卖，在农村应恢复原有集市，在城市也可以开辟若干市场。供应方面也应尽可能满足农民的需要，给农民以方便。
    《关于财贸工作向中央的汇报提要》，是毛泽东形成《论十大关系》一文前听取的各部门的汇报之一。这个汇报曾得到毛泽东的好评，并印发给中央和各地负责同志。汇报提要着重阐明财政工作要实行收入打足、支出打紧的方针，同时还提出了调整国家与企业、中央与地方的关系，调动各方面积极性的两个重要观点。在谈到改善企业的财务管理以调动企业的积极性的问题时，作者指出，目前国家对企业实行统收统支的办法，不利于企业从物质利益上关心国家计划的完成，为此他建议适当扩大各企业部门负责人在财务管理上的权限，积极准备对企业实行利润分成制度，使企业的支出同收入结合起来，以调动企业增加收入、节约支出的积极性。在论述适当扩大地方财政管理权限以调动地方的积极性的问题时，作者针对中央各部门对地方管得过多、过细、过分集中的缺点，明确提出必须适当扩大地方在财政管理上的权限和机动性。为此，计划体制和各部门的管理体制要作相应的改变。这些意见，指出了我国迅速建立起来的社会主义经济体制开始出现的某些弊端，提出了解决中央集权过多的问题。
    《生产和其他一切事业的发展必须放在稳妥可靠的基础上》，是一篇重要的、也是较早公开提出纠正１９５６年急躁冒进倾向的讲话。作者着重指出当时经济建设中存在片面追求多和快、不重视好和省的缺点，提出生产的发展和其他一切事业的发展都必须放在稳妥可靠的基础上，并建议对基本建设计划进行必要的、合理的调整。鉴于１９５６年经济建设的经验教训，１９５７年１月，陈云提出了建设规模要和国力相适应以及财政、信贷、物资必须平衡的重要观点。李先念完全同意陈云的意见，并在《财政、信贷、物资必须统一平衡》一文中，对这个观点作了详细的阐述。他总结了１９５６年国家预算和信贷计划在执行过程中发生若干冒进的教训，论述了保持财政、信贷、物资三者统一平衡的必要性和重要性，指出这是社会主义经济建设中必须遵循的一条客观规律，并提出实现三者平衡应遵循的若干具体界限，初步总结了社会主义经济建设的若干基本经验。
    《缓和市场紧张，发展副食品、手工业生产》、《当前财政金融中存在的问题和调整措施》、《就粮食问题给毛泽东的信》、《市场物价和货币流通中的问题及克服困难的办法》４篇著作，是作者在党中央领导下，为纠正“大跃进”和人民公社化运动的错误，战胜经济困难，参与领导国民经济调整的重要著作，这反映了他在“左”的思想占主导地位的情况下所作的艰苦努力。在第一篇文章里，作者针对“大跃进”中由于头脑发热和浮夸作风造成的各方面紧张与失调现象，提出大力增产副食品、恢复和发展手工业以及减少职工、压缩社会集团购买力、禁止扩大没有商品基础的货币投放等一系列政策措施。第二篇文章是庐山会议期间给党中央的报告。他针对财经工作中的浮夸现象，实事求是地指出，１９５８年财政结余实际上不存在，银行信贷支大于收，多发行了一些票子，而且１９５９年上述情况还在继续发展，粮食库存下降较多。为此，向中央提出了调整的建议。在第三篇文章中，作者具体地、详细地分析了浮夸风、高指标造成的在粮食问题上的尖锐矛盾和严重困难，权衡利弊，反复考虑，提出了１９６２年度进口１００亿斤粮食，减少４０亿斤征购粮，城市人口减少一个相当数字的方案。在第四篇文章中，作者更明确地指出了市场物价和货币流通中的主要问题是：票子多发了三四十亿元，商品可供量同购买力之间相差四五十亿元，物价上涨２０％以上，财政连续两年有３０多亿元赤字。为此，他提出了６条措施，特别是提出了将占职工生活开支６０％的１８类商品的价格和费用稳定下来，不得提高的建议。中央同意李先念的意见，并将他的这个报告转发全国执行。
    １９６３年起，我国国民经济开始全面好转，中央决定再用３年时间继续实行调整，并对经济体制进行了一些探索性的改革。在《对当前经济工作的几点意见》和《束缚生产力发展的规章制度要坚决地改》两篇重要著作中，作者强调了国民经济必须以农业为基础，必须加强基础工业，必须处理好积累和消费的关系；明确指出了财政、银行工作中存在的问题和改革规章制度的必要性，并指出改革的根本目的是要多快好省地发展生产。因此，凡是束缚生产力、不利于生产发展的东西，要坚决地改，彻底地改。作者还根据先立后破的精神，提出了财政工作改革的设想，以及改革中应该坚守的１０条界限。
    “文化大革命”期间收入文选的一组批语和两篇讲话，从若干方面体现了李先念在极其困难的条件下，协助周恩来总理主持国务院的经济工作，为减少政治动乱造成的损失，安排好生产和人民生活所作的不懈努力；体现了他在１９７５年协助邓小平，同江青反革命集团进行斗争，促进安定团结和发展国民经济所作的努力。
    １９７６年，在粉碎江青反革命集团的斗争中，李先念起了重要作用。这以后作者先后担任党中央副主席、中央政治局常委、国家主席等职。这一阶段收入文选的２９篇著作，反映了他在参与指导全党实现历史性的伟大转折和新的历史时期经济调整、改革开放工作中的重要意见。
    《重视社会主义商品生产和流通》是１９７８年６月在全国财贸大会上讲话的一部分，作者论述了商品生产和价值规律在社会主义经济中的作用，以及做好财贸工作的意义。在我们党的领导人中，这是一篇较早地重申商品生产、价值规律作用的文章，对以后的改革产生了积极影响。
    《在国务院务虚会上的讲话》中，作者又一次强调发展国民经济必须遵循客观经济规律，搞好综合平衡，处理好国民经济重大比例关系。讲话提出了改革计划、财政、物资、内外贸体制和企业管理体制的任务，并着重强调了要给予企业必要的独立地位和经营权力，以发挥企业的积极性。讲话还系统地阐述了搞好技术引进与提高自力更生能力的关系，指出既要积极引进，又要消化吸收，创造出新东西。他说，四个现代化是买不来的，那种什么都想买、一直买下去的懒汉思想，是永远也实现不了现代化的。他还根据几年来引进工作的经验，提出了确定引进项目时要遵守的９条原则。这些原则至今仍具有现实意义。
    《在中央工作会议上的讲话》是１９７９年４月代表党中央和国务院提出调整、改革、整顿、提高方针的重要讲话。讲话针对由于林彪、“四人帮”长期干扰破坏，以及粉碎“四人帮”以后经济工作上的某些失误，所造成的国民经济比例关系严重失调的状况，阐述了对国民经济实行调整的必要性，调整的主要任务和调整的原则、措施，阐述了实现四个现代化的指导思想和改革经济管理体制的问题。讲话中指出，我们搞现代化一定要从中国的国情出发，走出一条在社会主义制度下实现中国式现代化的道路。讲话专门论述了改革经济管理体制的问题，指出现行经济管理体制弊病很多，非逐步改革不可，并就计划指导与市场调节的关系、扩大企业自主权、明确中央和地方管理权限以及运用经济手段管理经济等问题，阐明了改革的原则和方向。
    《在全国计划会议上的讲话》、《对经济调整工作的几点意见》和《安排经济发展速度要实事求是》，是贯彻经济调整的３篇重要著作。作者又一次阐述了经济建设要循序前进，量力而行，避免瞎折腾等重要观点。他指出，人民群众希望建设速度快一点，但他们更要求不要再折腾。因为经济发展忽上忽下，上得很猛，跌得很凶，不但损失很大，而且要花几年时间才能恢复元气，想快反而慢。同时，他还具体阐述了量力而行的“力”的界限，这就是先保证简单再生产，再安排扩大再生产。他指出，这是我们党多年实践总结出来的一条重要经验，违反了就要摔跟头。
    《不能放松农田基本建设》一文，阐述了实现农业现代化和开展农田基本建设的关系。作者指出，不搞农田基本建设，不争取农业的高产稳产，就解决不了我国的农业过关问题，就实现不了农业现代化。搞农田基本建设一定要按客观规律办事，一定要坚持科学态度，因地制宜，讲究实效，互助互利，不能搞一平二调。当前搞农田基本建设，主要还是靠农民的劳动积累。
    《改革、开放政策符合中国国情》一文，是作者１９８７年上半年对外宾几次谈话的整理稿。他在谈话中，总结了改革开放以来的若干重要经验，指出我们的目标是建设有中国特色的社会主义，不能照搬外国的做法，也不能照老章程办事，必须大胆探索，找到一条符合自己国情的建设社会主义的道路。改革是社会主义制度的自我完善和发展，开放主要是把国外的先进科学技术和管理经验学到手，并利用一些外资。作者认为，归根到底，改革开放是为了加强我国社会主义物质文明和精神文明的建设。十一届三中全会以来，改革开放取得了很大成绩，人民是拥护的。凡是人民拥护的东西，不会变，也变不了。改革开放要处理好计划与市场的关系，发展商品经济总体上是要发展公有制为基础的有计划的社会主义商品经济。改革中要允许和鼓励一部分多劳、好劳的人先富起来，而我们的目标是共同富裕，决不能听任两极分化。保证十亿人口都能温饱，还是一条基本国策。改革从整体上要放权，但有些权必须国家掌握，不能什么都放；要避免基建、消费、物价等失控。改革开放和坚持四项基本原则是不可分的，是统一的，可以而且应该协调地发展。要坚持自力更生，并注意反对资产阶级腐朽思想作风，把社会风气、社会秩序搞好。要坚持和改善党的领导，适应改革开放需要，同时坚持党的优良传统，等等。
    《李先念文选》的出版，对于研究和总结我国革命和建设的历史经验，推动我国社会主义现代化建设和改革事业的发展，具有重要意义。
