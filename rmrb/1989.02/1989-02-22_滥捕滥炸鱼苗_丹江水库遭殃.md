Overfishing and Bombing of Fish Fry Devastates Danjiang Reservoir

In recent years, some people near the Danjiang Reservoir in our county have been using small-mesh nets and explosives to catch and bomb fish fry. Nowadays, many households near the Danjiang Reservoir have several kilograms, or even tens of kilograms, of dried small fish.

We appeal to the relevant departments to take measures to stop the overfishing and bombing of fish fry.

　　滥捕滥炸鱼苗　丹江水库遭殃
    近几年来，我县丹江水库附近的一些人用小眼网和炸药捕捞、滥炸鱼苗。现在，丹江水库附近的不少家庭，有几公斤、甚至数十公斤小鱼干。
    呼吁有关部门采取措施，制止滥捕、滥炸鱼苗的行为。
