Mr. Wu Honggang, aged 87, traveled from Hong Kong to Qingdao last April to tour and visit relatives and friends. While staying with friends in Qingdao, he unfortunately fell ill and was bedridden. After being treated in the hospital for several dozen days with no improvement, Mr. Wu's eldest son rushed from Hong Kong to Qingdao. Seeing his father's poor condition, the son deemed it unsuitable for his father to travel back to Hong Kong for treatment. Therefore, Mr. Wu's eldest son sought help from the Qingdao Welfare Institute, requesting that they care for his father. The Welfare Institute agreed to his request. After Mr. Wu was admitted to the Welfare Institute, he received meticulous treatment and care from the medical staff, eventually recovering. Before leaving the institute, the elderly man, to express his gratitude, donated a plaque to the Welfare Institute with the inscription: "Wandering the world, returning to my homeland, the warmth of kinship touches the heart of this overseas Chinese."

　　浪迹老侨翁　倍感乡情亲
    87岁高龄的吴鸿刚老先生，去年4月由香港来青岛旅游和探亲访友，寓居青岛友人家中，不幸染病卧床不起，经送医院治疗数十日不见好转。吴老先生的长子闻讯从香港赶到青岛，见他父亲当时的身体状况不佳，不宜长途跋涉返回香港治疗。于是，吴老先生的长子向青岛市福利院求援，请求为他护养父亲。福利院接受了他的请求。吴老先生住进福利院后，经院内医护人员精心治疗和护理，终于康复。离院前，老人为表达感激之情，赠送福利院一面锦旗，上写：“浪迹天涯归故里，倍感亲情暖侨翁”。                  山东青岛市民政局　黄光荣
