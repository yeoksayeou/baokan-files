Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 13th.

A foreign exchange adjustment market with initial scale and management has been established in China.

Today, the opening of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange's national bureau chiefs' conference revealed that 39 provinces, municipalities, autonomous regions, special economic zones, and cities with separate planning have successively established foreign exchange adjustment centers. Beijing has established the national foreign exchange adjustment center. In 1988, the national foreign exchange adjustment transaction amount reached $6.264 billion, accounting for one-third of the total retained foreign exchange for the same period nationwide and 18% of the national import foreign exchange for the same period.

The operation in the previous period has proven that the state's macro-control of the foreign exchange market can indeed achieve results. The Shanghai Foreign Exchange Adjustment Center has enhanced market transparency, restricted overheated demand, and timely adjusted the direction of foreign exchange use. They periodically publish the priority sequence for purchasing foreign exchange, prioritizing the adjustment of foreign exchange for agricultural production, short-term raw materials, and other imports. Shenzhen has guided the direction of foreign exchange adjustment, using it to introduce advanced technology and equipment and agricultural production materials, strictly limiting its use for purchasing high-end consumer goods and non-essential items, and using over $30 million in adjusted foreign exchange to support Hainan, Guangxi, Chengdu, Yunnan, Jilin, and other regions.

Foreign-invested enterprises and state-owned enterprises, collective enterprises have transitioned from separate adjustments to mutual adjustments, expanding the adjustment scope and opening up the market. Last year, foreign-invested enterprises adjusted out $662 million and adjusted in $220 million, with adjustments out exceeding adjustments in. This has played a significant role in promoting their exports, solving the foreign exchange imbalance of some enterprises, and encouraging their investment and operational enthusiasm.

Shenzhen, Xiamen, Ningbo, Quanzhou, and other places have also experimented with individual foreign exchange adjustments.

　　我外汇调剂市场初具规模    
    去年成交６２亿多美元　用汇方向得到引导
    本报北京２月１３日讯  记者计泓赓报道：一个初具规模、有管理的外汇调剂市场已在我国建立。
    今天开幕的国家外汇管理局全国分局长会议透露，全国３９个省、市、自治区、经济特区、计划单列城市先后成立了外汇调剂中心，北京成立了全国外汇调剂中心。１９８８年全国调剂外汇成交额达６２．６４亿美元，占同期全国留成外汇总额１／３，占全国同期进口用汇的１８％。
    前一段的运行证明，国家对外汇市场实行宏观调控，完全可以有所作为。上海外汇调剂中心增强交易市场透明度，限制过热需求，及时调整用汇方向。他们不定期公布买汇优先顺序，优先为农业生产、短线原材料等进口用汇进行调剂。深圳引导调剂外汇投向，借以引进先进技术设备和农用生产资料，严格限制用来购买高档消费品和非生活必需品，并以３０００多万美元调剂外汇支援海南、广西、成都、云南、吉林等地。
    外商投资企业和国营企业、集体企业之间，已由各自分别调剂变为互相调剂，扩大了调剂面，打通了市场。去年外商投资企业调出６．６２亿美元，调入２．２亿美元，调出大于调入，这对促进其出口、解决某些企业外汇不平衡和鼓励其投资经营积极性，起了很大作用。
    深圳、厦门、宁波、泉州等地，还试办了个人外汇调剂。
