	Balancing "Cutting Expenses" and "Increasing Revenue":
	Sanming Uses Less Land and Develops More Arable Land

	According to a report by Zhang Mingqing for this newspaper, in Sanming City, Fujian Province, the reporter noticed several interesting figures: The city's planned land use indicator for last year was 2,205 mu of arable land, but only 1,004 mu were actually used, which is 45.5% of the planned indicator. Meanwhile, the city developed 4,000 mu of land. For every mu of land used, four mu of land were reclaimed. These newly reclaimed lands produced over 800,000 kilograms of grain in one year.

	Sanming City adheres to the principle of balancing "increasing revenue" and "cutting expenses" in land management, strictly controlling the use of arable land indicators. Based on the provincial land use plan, the indicators are broken down and allocated to each county and district. The city ensures that "five checkpoints" are in place: the land use plan indicator checkpoint (no plan, no approval), the land use standard checkpoint (exceeding the land use limit, no approval), the planning checkpoint (not in accordance with the plan, no approval), the approval checkpoint (not in accordance with the approval procedures and authority regulations, no approval), and the inspection checkpoint (tracking and inspecting the land-using units). Strict management not only blocks the channels for excessive land use but also saves more than half of the planned indicators.

	To balance the supply and demand of land and expand the area of arable land, Sanming City includes land development in the plan, formulates preferential policies, promotes typical experiences, and strengthens inspections and supervision. According to the principle of "using one, developing two," the land development plan is issued simultaneously with the construction land plan. If the development plan is not completed, construction land will not be approved. To encourage farmers to reclaim land, Sanming City has formulated preferential measures such as "who develops, who contracts, who benefits, fixed for 15 years, allowing inheritance and subcontracting," "newly reclaimed land used for grain cultivation is exempt from agricultural tax for 5 years and from grain procurement tasks for 5 years, and used for economic crops is exempt from tax for 3 years." To encourage development, each county also provides support in terms of funds and materials based on their own situations.

### 一手抓“节流”　一手抓“开源”  三明占用土地少开发耕地多

　　一手抓“节流”　一手抓“开源”   
    三明占用土地少开发耕地多
    本报讯  记者张铭清报道：在福建省三明市，记者看到这样几个令人感兴趣的数字：全市去年计划占用耕地指标２２０５亩，实际只占用１００４亩，为计划指标的４５．５％，而全市开发土地４０００亩。用地一亩，造田４亩，这些新开土地一年收获粮食８０多万公斤。
    三明市在土地管理上坚持一手抓“开源”，一手抓“节流”的原则，严格控制占用耕地指标。根据省下达的用地计划，把指标分解下达给各县、区，并把好“五道关口”：即用地计划指标关，无计划指标不批；用地标准关，超用地限额不批；规划关，不符合规划的不批；审批关，不符合审批程序、审批权限规定的不批；检查关，对用地单位追踪检查。严格的管理不但堵住了多占地的渠道，还节约了一半多的计划指标。
    为了平衡土地供需关系，扩大耕地面积，三明市把开发耕地列入计划，制定优惠政策，推广典型经验，加强检查督促。按“用一开二”的原则把开发耕地计划与建设用地计划同时下达，不完成开发计划不批给建设用地。为了鼓励农民开荒造田，三明市制定了“谁开发、谁承包、谁受益、一定１５年不变，允许继承、转包”，“新开土地用于种粮免征５年农业税、免交５年粮食征购任务，用于种经济作物免征３年税收”等优惠措施。为了鼓励开发，各县还根据各自情况在资金、物资等方面给予支持。
