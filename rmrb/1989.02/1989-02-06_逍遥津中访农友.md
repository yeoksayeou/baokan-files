	Visiting Peasant Friends in Xiaoyaojin
	Xǔ Xiùfāng

	On the eve of the Spring Festival, the entrance to Xiaoyaojin Park, located northeast of Hefei City, Anhui Province, was bustling with people. Among them, peasants dressed in traditional attire stood out the most. They wore woolen overcoats, but their feet were still covered in the yellow soil from the countryside. Some carried newly purchased bedding, while others hugged new down jackets; some had shoe boxes under their arms and firecrackers in their hands...

	The manager of the park's ticket office told the reporter: Since winter began and farming activities slowed down, more than half of the over 3,000 daily visitors to the park are peasants. They usually come to the city to buy New Year's goods and then visit the park. Although it is deep winter, their enthusiasm for sightseeing is high. For many of them, this is the first time they have come to see the actual site of Zhang Liao's famous battle at Xiaoyaojin, which they had only heard about in folk stories.

	At the park's boat rental office, the reporter interviewed a worker on duty:

	"Comrade, do many peasants come to rent boats?"

	"Many! Especially after the Spring Festival during the first month of the lunar year, even more peasant brothers come to rent boats. In previous years, we couldn't keep up with the demand for our over 100 boats."

	In the park's restaurant, the reporter observed that among the more than ten tables of diners, two-thirds were peasants. They had new clothes piled under their seats, and their orders usually consisted of two or three stir-fried dishes, one of the restaurant's signature dishes—braised fish, a bottle of white liquor, and a bowl of sliced meat soup. The reporter was drawn to four peasants who were enjoying a beef hotpot, two stir-fried dishes, and a bottle of "Gujiu" liquor. The reporter approached them for an interview. Surrounding peasants, hearing that the reporter was conducting an interview, also gathered around to chat.

	"How is your New Year's shopping coming along?"

	Xǔ Wèifā, a peasant from Chenwan Village, Huangdao Township, Lùjiāng County, said: "We have already slaughtered the chickens, ducks, and geese at home. I mainly came to the city to buy some clothes, melon seeds, and fruits for the adults and children for the New Year."

	A middle-aged peasant from Sānhé Town, Féixī County, said: "My family of four plans to spend 400 yuan for the New Year. Is that considered wasteful?"

	Wáng Yuébīn from Nányuán Village, Zhāngjí Township, Féidōng County, replied: "This year, our area suffered from drought and pestilence, so the harvest was not good. Our family of six only harvested nearly 4,000 jin of rice. Life is a bit tight." Xǔ Wèifā from Lùjiāng County said: "We have irrigation from Lake Poyang, so we don't worry about drought, but we fear flooding. This year's harvest was good. Our family of four, with six mu and six fen of land, harvested over 5,900 jin of rice in two seasons; my wife runs a family sideline business at home, earning at least 1,000 yuan a year; our home is only 45 kilometers from Hefei, and just during the spring and autumn seasons, I can earn around 2,000 yuan by selling vegetables in the city. In terms of economic income, our family's income this year is at least 1,500 yuan more than last year, and our grain production is 30% more than last year. Now we have saved 2,000 yuan." Wáng Gōngchuán from Wúmiào Village, Rènqiáo District, Gùzhèn County, added: "Our family of five earned more than 5,000 yuan from grain and economic crops this year; a small four-wheeled vehicle for transportation can earn five or six thousand yuan a year. We held a wedding for our son without borrowing money, and our life is better than last year."

	The reporter then asked: "How is the redemption of the white coupons going?"

	Zuǒ Cóngwén, a young peasant from Chenwan Village, Huangdao Township, Lùjiāng County, said: "The government keeps its word. Those that were supposed to be redeemed have been redeemed. Even those that have not been redeemed can still circulate within the specified range." Qín Míngjīn from Sūnjí Township, Lúqiáo District, Dìngyuān County, said: "They have all been redeemed. It's just that in our place, 20% of the savings are awarded with lottery tickets, which is managed by the grain department."

	"Have you prepared the production materials for the spring plowing?" Wáng Gōngchuán from Gùzhèn said: "We have prepared the chemical fertilizer and farmyard manure, but we can't buy diesel."

	"Chemical fertilizer is bought at a high price, and good seeds are hard to come by," another peasant added.

	During the conversation, the peasants had many criticisms: "Village cadres levy too much, and feasting is rampant"; "Nowadays, in the countryside, power means influence, money means power, and honest people often get bullied"; "Subsidized chemical fertilizer is not redeemed, and often within the specified time, the money cannot be gathered, and after the deadline, it is called buying at a high price"...

	These peasant brothers hope that cadres will change their style of work and that the local Party and government will genuinely do a few practical things for the peasants.

　　逍遥津中访农友
　　许秀芳
    春节前夕，坐落在安徽省合肥市东北方向的逍遥津公园门口人流如潮。其间农民装束的游客最引人注目，他们身着毛呢大衣，可两脚仍带有乡间的黄土。有的身背刚买来的床上用品，怀抱新购的羽绒服；有的腋下挟着皮鞋盒，手里拿着花炮……
    公园门票管理处的负责人告诉记者：入冬农闲以来，每天游公园的３０００多游客中，半数以上是农民。他们一般是进城购年货顺便来公园看看的。尽管是隆冬腊月，但他们的游兴很高。因为对他们中的不少人来说，过去只是听民间艺人说《三国》故事——张辽威震逍遥津，而从未到实地游玩过。
    在公园划船管理处，记者访问了当班的老师傅：
    “师傅，农民来划船的多吗？”
    “多！特别是春节后正月里，划船的农民兄弟还要多。往年我们１００多条船都忙不过来哩。”
    在公园的餐馆里，记者观察到，在十多桌就餐的游客中，有２／３的座上客是农民。他们的屁股下、凳子上大都垫着新购来的衣物，点的菜一般都是两三个炒菜、一个逍遥津餐馆的拿手菜——红烧鱼，一瓶白酒、一份肉片汤。记者被４位正围着一个牛肉火锅、两个炒菜、一斤“古井玉液”在津津有味地品尝着的农民所吸引，便走上前去采访了他们。周围的农民听说是记者采访，都凑过来，和记者攀谈。
    “你们年货办得怎么样了？”
    来自庐江县黄道乡陈湾村的农民许卫发说：“家里鸡、鸭、鹅都杀好了。我主要是进城给大人孩子买点衣服、瓜子、水果过年。”
    来自肥西县三河镇的一位中年农民说：“我全家四口人，准备花４００元钱过年，不算浪费吧？”
    “今年的收成怎么样？”来自肥东县张集乡南圆村的王跃斌回答：“今年我们那里干旱加虫灾，收成不大好，全家六口人，只收到近４０００斤稻谷。生活有点紧。”来自庐江县的许卫发说：“我们有巢湖的水灌溉，不怕旱，就怕涝。今年收成好。我全家四口人，六亩六分地，两季稻就收５９００多公斤；我老婆在家搞家庭副业，一年起码收入１０００元；我们家离合肥只有４５公里，光春秋两季进城推销蔬菜，我一个人毛估能挣２０００元。从经济收入来讲，我家今年至少比去年增加１５００元，粮食要比上年增加３０％。现在存了２０００元。”固镇县任桥区吴庙村的王功臣接过话茬说：“我家五口人，今年粮食、经济作物合在一起收入不下５０００元；一部小四轮跑运输，一年起码能挣五六千。给儿子办了喜事，也没借债，日子过的比上年好。”
    记者又问：“大家关心的白条子兑现的怎么样了？”庐江县黄道乡陈湾村的青年农民左从文说：“政府说话是算数的，说兑现的都兑现了。即使没兑现的，在规定的范围内也可以流通。”定远县炉桥区孙集乡的秦明金说：“兑现都兑现了。就是我们那里按２０％搭有奖储蓄券，是粮食部门搞的。”“你们春耕生产资料准备得怎么样？”来自固镇的王功臣说：“化肥、农家肥都备好了，就是买不到柴油。”“化肥买的是高价，良种又难买。”另一位农民补充说。
    谈话中，农民有不少批评：“农村干部提留过多，吃喝成风”；“现在农村有权就有势，有钱就有权，老实巴脚的人常常受欺”；“平价化肥不兑现，往往在规定的时间凑不齐钱，过期就叫买高价”……
    这些农民兄弟，希望干部改变作风，希望当地党和政府为农民切切实实办几件实事。
