The first summit of the five Central American countries was held in Esquipulas, Guatemala, on May 24-25, 1986. The meeting primarily discussed the "Central American Peace Memorandum" proposed by the Contadora Group. However, due to significant disagreements among the participating countries over clauses in the "Memorandum" regarding military exercises and arms control, the "Memorandum" was not signed.

The second summit of the five Central American countries was held in Esquipulas on August 6-7, 1987. The meeting discussed and adopted the Central American peace plan proposed by Costa Rican President Arias, and signed the "Procedure for Establishing Stable and Lasting Peace in Central America" (simply referred to as the Central American Peace Agreement). The agreement stipulated that from the date of its signing, a ceasefire would be implemented simultaneously in the Central American region within 90 days, amnesty laws would be promulgated, the process of democratization would begin, and the use of one country's territory to create unrest in neighboring countries would be prohibited. This was a significant event in the Central American peace process.

The third summit of the five Central American countries was held in San José, the capital of Costa Rica, on January 15-16, 1988. The meeting issued a joint declaration on the pursuit of peace in the region. The document stipulated that the evaluation of the peace process would be the responsibility of the foreign ministers of the five Central American countries; they would check the situation regarding the ceasefire, amnesty, and democratization process. The meeting reaffirmed the historical significance and importance of the Central American Peace Agreement reached at the second Esquipulas meeting and emphasized that the problems of Central America should be resolved by the people of Central America.

On February 13, the summit of the five Central American countries opened. The image shows the leaders of Honduras, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Nicaragua at the opening ceremony.

　　中美洲五国首脑会议
    中美洲５国第１次首脑会议于１９８６年５月２４日—２５日在危地马拉的埃斯基普拉斯举行。会议主要讨论了由孔塔多拉集团提出的“中美洲和平纪要”。但由于与会国对“纪要”中有关军事演习、控制军备等条款存在重大分歧，“纪要”未得签署。
    １９８７年８月６日—７日在埃斯基普拉斯举行了第２次中美洲５国首脑会议。会议讨论并通过了哥斯达黎加总统阿里亚斯提出的中美洲和平计划，签署了《中美洲建立稳定和持久和平的程序》（简称中美洲和平协议）。协议规定，从达成协议之日起，中美洲地区在９０天内同时实行停火，颁布大赦法、开始民主化进程和禁止利用一国领土给邻国制造动乱。这是中美洲和平进程中具有积极意义的一件大事。
    中美洲５国第３次首脑会议于１９８８年１月１５日—１６日在哥斯达黎加首都圣何塞举行。会议发表了关于争取该地区和平的联合声明。该文件规定：对和平进程的评价工作将由中美洲５国外长负责；他们将对停火、大赦和民主化进程的情况进行检查。会议重申了第二次埃斯基普拉斯会议达成的中美洲和平协议的历史意义和重要性，并强调中美洲的问题应该由中美洲人民来解决。
