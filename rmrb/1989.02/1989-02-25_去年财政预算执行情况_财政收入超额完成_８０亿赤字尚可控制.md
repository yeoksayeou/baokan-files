The fiscal budget execution for last year was as follows: The national fiscal revenue exceeded the state budget target. According to current estimates, the total fiscal revenue and expenditure, when offset, will allow the deficit to be controlled within the budgeted amount. Last year, the fiscal budget deficit was 8 billion yuan.

Wang Binqian, State Councilor and Minister of Finance, revealed this at the National Conference of Tax Bureau Directors today. He emphasized that tax revenue should play a greater role in the ongoing rectification and adjustment efforts. He stated that recently, the State Council has issued three important documents on strengthening tax work, a situation that has never occurred before. Taxation is an indispensable major economic lever for the state to intervene in the economy, control, and regulate the commodity market. Over 90% of China's fiscal revenue comes from taxation. Adjusting the industrial structure, controlling the scale of construction, curbing consumption demand, and regulating social distribution fairness all require the role of taxation. However, currently, tax work has not been widely understood and supported by society, and paying taxes in accordance with the law has not yet become a conscious action for people. In recent years, tax order has been chaotic, tax evasion and avoidance are widespread, unauthorized tax exemptions and reductions are serious, and violent tax resistance incidents occur from time to time. These phenomena not only significantly reduce national fiscal revenue but also weaken the macro-control function of taxation, disrupting the smooth progress of reform and construction.

Wang Binqian pointed out that paying taxes in accordance with the law is the duty of every citizen. All units and individuals have the responsibility to pay taxes in accordance with the law, support tax work, maintain tax order, and ensure the implementation of national tax laws. Wang Binqian said that this year, efforts will be made to further clean up and rectify tax exemptions and reductions, and strengthen the management of tax exemptions and reductions. He emphasized that the power to exempt and reduce taxes is mainly concentrated in the central government and should not be decentralized. Local governments and departments should not exceed their authority to exempt and reduce taxes. In the latter half of this year, at an appropriate time, tax, financial, and price inspections will be organized again.

### 去年财政预算执行情况  财政收入超额完成  ８０亿赤字尚可控制

　　去年财政预算执行情况
    财政收入超额完成  ８０亿赤字尚可控制
    本报北京２月２４日讯  记者王锦鹄报道：去年财政预算执行情况如何？国务委员兼财政部长王丙乾今日在全国税务局长会议上透露，１９８８年我国财政收入超额完成了国家预算。根据现在的预计数字，财政总收入与总支出相抵，赤字可以按预算确定的数额进行控制。去年，财政预算赤字为８０亿元。
    王丙乾要求税收在治理、整顿中发挥更大作用。他说，最近国务院就加强税收工作连续发了三个重要文件，这种情况从未有过。税收是国家干预经济、驾驭和调控商品市场不可缺少的主要经济杠杆之一。我国财政收入９０％以上靠税收，调整产业结构、控制基建规模、抑制消费需求、调节社会分配公平等都需发挥税收作用。但是，目前税收工作尚未得到整个社会的广泛理解和支持，依法纳税还没有成为人们的自觉行动。这几年税收秩序混乱，偷税漏税普遍，越权减免税严重，暴力抗税事件时有发生。这些现象，不仅大量减少了国家财政收入，而且削弱了税收的宏观调控作用，干扰了改革和建设事业的顺利进行。
    王丙乾指出，依法纳税是每个公民的应尽义务，任何单位、任何个人都有责任按照税法交纳税款，支持税收工作，维护税收秩序，保证国家税法的实施。王丙乾说，今年要进一步清理整顿减免税，加强减免税的管理。他强调，税收的减免权主要集中在中央，不能分散，各地各部门不能超越权限减免税收。今年下半年适当时候，还要继续组织税收、财务、物价大检查。
