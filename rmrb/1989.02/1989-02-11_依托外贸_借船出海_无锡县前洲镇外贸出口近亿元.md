	Leaning on foreign trade to "borrow a boat" to go to sea
	Wuxi County Qianzhou Town's foreign trade exports near 100 million yuan

	People's Daily reports: Jiangsu Province Wuxi County Qianzhou Town relies on foreign trade to "borrow a boat" to go to sea. The production of export and foreign exchange earning products has increased threefold for three consecutive years. In 1988, the town completed a foreign trade procurement amount of 99.18 million yuan.

	Qianzhou Town's township industry started relatively early, but the production of export and foreign exchange earning products began in 1985, with a foreign trade procurement amount of 13 million yuan that year. Given the intense competition in domestic raw materials and markets, to ensure the stable and sustainable development of the town's industry, the town's Party Committee, after repeated research and discussion, decided to utilize the town's strong industrial base, coastal location, and convenient water and land transportation, to develop an outward-looking economy. The aim was to extend both raw materials and markets to overseas.

	To address issues such as lack of market information and smooth export channels, they cooperated with several foreign trade ports. Using the ports as a base, they leveraged the advantages of the foreign trade departments' capital, raw materials, and broad export channels, enabling their products to enter the international market. In 1986, they successively invested with the Shanghai Knitting Products Import and Export Company and the Jiangsu Provincial Arts and Crafts Import and Export Company to establish the Qianzhou Woolen Mill and Qianzhou Toy Factory. The following year, they completed foreign trade procurement amounts of 190 million yuan and 72.1 million yuan, respectively, achieving profits of 26 million yuan and 7.8 million yuan. The joint ventures achieved good economic benefits, gaining the trust of the foreign trade departments, and the number of joint ventures increased from two to six.

	Qianzhou Town, with the support of foreign trade, eased the shortage of funds, secured a reliable source of major raw materials, ensured smooth export sales channels, stabilized production, and reduced business costs. As the number of industrial and commercial joint ventures increased and grew stronger, it significantly promoted the town's development towards an outward-looking economy and cultivated a batch of professional foreign trade talents.

　　依托外贸　借船出海    
    无锡县前洲镇外贸出口近亿元
    本报讯  江苏省无锡县前洲镇依托外贸借“船”出海，出口创汇产品生产连续３年翻番，１９８８年全镇完成外贸收购额９９１８万元。
    前洲镇的乡镇工业起步较早，但生产出口创汇产品是从１９８５年才开始的，当年完成外贸收购额１３０万元。鉴于国内原材料和市场竞争激烈，为了使本镇的工业继续稳定持久地发展，镇党委经过反复研究论证，决定利用自己工业实力较强，地处沿海地区和水陆交通运输方便等条件，向外向型经济发展，把原材料和市场“两头”延伸到国外去。为解决市场信息不灵、产品出口渠道不畅等问题，他们与一些外贸口岸合作，以口岸作依托，借助外贸部门的资金、原材料、外销渠道广阔等优势，使自己的产品跻身国际市场。１９８６年他们先后同上海针织品进出口公司和江苏省工艺品进出口公司共同投资分别建成前达毛纺厂和前洲玩具厂。第２年，就分别完成外贸收购额１９００万元和７２１万元，分别实现利润２６０万元和７８万元。联营厂取得较好的经济效益，赢得了外贸部门的信任，联营企业从两家增加到６家。
    前洲镇由于有外贸作依托，缓解了资金短缺的矛盾，主要原材料也有了可靠的来源，对外销售渠道畅通，生产稳定，业务费用降低。随着工贸联营企业的增多和壮大，有力地促进了全镇向外向型经济的发展，也造就了一批懂行的各类外贸专业人才。
