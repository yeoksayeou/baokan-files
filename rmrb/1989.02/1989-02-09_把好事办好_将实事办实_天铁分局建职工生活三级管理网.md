The Tianjin Railway Division has consistently focused on improving living conditions, promoting production, and ensuring safety. Over the past few years, they have gradually established a three-level management network for staff living conditions. This ensures that every issue related to staff living conditions is addressed by someone, and every matter has a resolution, thereby stabilizing the staff's emotions and promoting production development.

Since 1984, the division has emphasized that staff management should be strict and that staff living conditions should be cared for even more. Over the years, they have built 16,000 staff residences, provided water to 13,000 households, arranged jobs for 14,000 unemployed youth, constructed 7 kindergartens, and increased the capacity to care for 1,630 children. These efforts have significantly improved the actual living conditions of the staff. However, with the increase in living service facilities, issues arose where management work lagged behind, and coordination between life departments and units was lacking, causing inconveniences for the staff.

To address these issues, Division Director Wang Runsheng and Party Secretary Cao Yide frequently led relevant department personnel to the frontlines for on-site office work. They also established a three-level management system for living conditions at the division, regional, and grassroots unit levels. This management network assigns specific responsibilities, ensures accountability at each level, and holds weekly meetings to promptly communicate information.

With the reduction of staff concerns, the safety production situation has become more proactive. Last year, they achieved the best historical record of four consecutive years without major or large accidents, with a continuous 1,669 days without such incidents.

　　把好事办好　将实事办实
　  天铁分局建职工生活三级管理网
    本报讯  记者赵志文报道：天津铁路分局坚持抓生活、促生产、保安全的经营指导思想，几年来逐步建立职工生活三级管理网。使职工生活问题，事事有人管，件件有着落，稳定了职工思想情绪，促进了生产的发展。
    早在１９８４年以来，该分局就提出：对职工管理要严上加严，对职工生活要关心再关心。这几年共建成职工住宅１．６万户，引水入户１．３万家，安置待业青年１．４万人，修建托幼园７个，扩大收托能力１６３０人。使职工的生活实际问题得到了改善。随着生活服务设施的大量增加，出现了管理工作跟不上去，生活部门、单位之间不协调的现象，给职工生活带来了不便。
    为此，分局长王润生、党委书记曹义德经常带领有关部门的同志深入基层现场办公。此外还有步骤地建立分局、地区、基层单位层层负责的三级生活系统管理网。这个管理网定职定责，逐级包保，每周开碰头会及时沟通信息。
    由于职工的后顾之忧少了，安全生产形势越来越主动，去年他们创造了连续实现四个安全年，连续１６６９天无重大、大事故的历史最好成绩。
