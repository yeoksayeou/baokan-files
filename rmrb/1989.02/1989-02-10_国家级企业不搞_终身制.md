Shanghai Electric Refrigerator Factory and Shanghai Gaoqiao Petrochemical Company's Refining Plant have had their second-level state enterprise titles revoked; Zhejiang Plastic Machinery Factory and Tianjin Bicycle Factory have been warned and given one year to rectify their issues, after which they will be reassessed. If they fail to meet the standards, their titles will also be revoked.

According to a report by our reporter Jiang Shaogao, Shanghai Electric Refrigerator Factory and Shanghai Gaoqiao Petrochemical Company's Refining Plant have recently had their second-level state enterprise titles revoked by the Ministry of Light Industry and the China Petrochemical Corporation, respectively. Zhejiang Plastic Machinery Factory and Tianjin Bicycle Factory have been warned by the Ministry of Light Industry and given one year to rectify their issues. They will be reassessed after this period, and if they fail to meet the standards, their titles will also be revoked.

On November 15, 1988, Shanghai Electric Refrigerator Factory experienced a major fire, causing direct economic losses of 104.7 million yuan. Although the direct cause was a worker from an out-of-province construction team, the incident exposed issues such as poor enterprise management, inadequate warehouse management regulations, and lack of necessary safety education for workers.

On October 22, 1988, Shanghai Gaoqiao Petrochemical Company's Refining Plant had a serious liquefied gas explosion in the Xiaoliangshan spherical tank area, resulting in a number of deaths and direct economic losses that exceeded the company's safety assessment standards for enterprise upgrades.

On September 2, 1988, a security officer at Zhejiang Plastic Machinery Factory fell from a height of 4.5 meters while installing an alarm line on the roof of the factory's oil depot, resulting in death despite rescue efforts. On October 25, 1988, Tianjin Bicycle Factory had a hydrogen sulfide poisoning incident, resulting in one death, one severe poisoning, and four cases of mild poisoning.

According to the relevant departments' "Temporary Regulations on Safety Issues for Enterprise Upgrade Evaluations," the State Council's Enterprise Management Guidance Committee agreed with the opinions of the Ministry of Light Industry and the China Petrochemical Corporation, and made the above decisions regarding the four second-level state enterprises.

　　国家级企业不搞“终身制”
    上海电冰箱厂、上海高桥石油化工公司炼油厂被撤销二级国家企业称号；浙江塑料机械厂、天津自行车厂被警告，限一年整改
    本报讯　记者江绍高报道：上海电冰箱厂、上海高桥石油化工公司炼油厂最近分别被轻工业部、中国石油化工总公司撤销国家二级企业称号；浙江塑料机械厂、天津自行车厂被轻工业部警告，限期一年整改，经验收合格后再恢复国家二级企业称号，否则予以撤销。
    １９８８年１１月１５日，上海电冰箱厂发生特大火灾，造成直接经济损失１０４．７万元，尽管直接肇事者系外省建筑队一民工，但暴露了该厂企业管理不善、仓库管理规章制度不健全、对民工缺乏必要的安全教育等问题。
    １９８８年１０月２２日，上海高桥石油化工公司炼油厂小梁山球罐区发生液化气爆燃重大恶性事故，死亡人数和直接经济损失均已超过总公司规定的企业升级安全考核指标。
    １９８８年９月２日，浙江塑料机械厂一名保卫干部在厂油库墙上安装报警线时，踏碎屋顶石棉瓦，从４．５米高处坠落，经抢救无效死亡；１９８８年１０月２５日，天津自行车厂发生硫化氢中毒事故，死亡１人，重度中毒１人，轻度中毒４人。
    根据国家有关部门《关于企业升级考评安全问题的暂行规定》，国务院企业管理指导委员会同意轻工业部和中国石油化工总公司的意见，对上述４户国家二级企业作出以上处理。
