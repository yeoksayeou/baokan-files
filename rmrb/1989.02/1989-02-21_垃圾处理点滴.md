Waste Management: A Few Drops

    By Zhang Qihua, Correspondent

    Paris

    Collection Methods: Paris and its surrounding sixty-plus small towns have a population of five million, generating nearly ten thousand tons of domestic waste daily. The city has five hundred sanitation trucks that operate on a fixed schedule, collecting waste from designated areas. For large items and bulk waste, designated points are set up for classified collection. The city has thirty large waste collection stations. Residents can dispose of waste at the nearest station. The Chabrol Gate collection station, which we visited, was completed last year. Its main equipment includes a large platform and six containers for sorting waste into different categories. The annual collection capacity is 4,500 tons. Those unable to dispose of their own waste can call the relevant department to arrange for collection. In 1987, there were 70,000 such calls.

    Processing and Utilization: There are three large waste processing plants on the outskirts of the city. These plants can process two million tons of domestic waste annually and produce significant by-products: 300,000 tons of steam, 120,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity, and nearly 500,000 tons of electric furnace slag. It is said that recycling ten tons of glassware can save one ton of oil. The city has set up 800 glass bottle collection bins, which separately collect colorless and colored glass products. Some glass bottles, after cleaning and processing, can be reused. There is a factory in the suburbs dedicated to cleaning used glass bottles, with an annual processing capacity of 130,000 tons.

    Propaganda and Education: Paris places great importance on the propaganda and education related to waste management. The city government and various tourism departments distribute brochures in five languages, reminding the public to maintain the cleanliness of the capital. An advertisement for recycling glass products reads: "If everyone places two old wine bottles in the designated bins each month, the city can provide 500,000 francs to the anti-cancer association annually."

    Additionally, the city government emphasizes controlling waste at the source to reduce the amount of waste generated, and this is explicitly stated in government regulations.

　　垃圾处理点滴

    收集方法：巴黎及其周围六十多个小城镇共有人口五百万，每天产生生活垃圾近万吨。市区共有五百辆清洁车，它们分片包干，在固定时间走街串巷收集居民集放的垃圾包。对于大件废物及大批量垃圾，则定点分类收集。全市有三十个大件垃圾收集站，居民可就近扔放，我们参观的沙贝尔门收集站是去年刚建成的。主要设备有一个大平台、六个集装箱，把垃圾分门别类装入箱内，年收集能力为四千五百吨。无力处理自家垃圾的人可打电话约请主管部门派人来收。一九八七年，电话约收垃圾的有七万人次。
    处理和利用：市区外围有三家大型垃圾处理厂，它们每年能处理二百万吨生活垃圾，且生产可观的副产品：三百万吨蒸汽、十二万度电和近五十万吨电炉渣等。据介绍，每回收十吨玻璃器皿回炉再生，就能节约一吨石油。市区设置了八百个玻璃瓶收集箱，这种箱子分别收集无色和有色玻璃制品。有的玻璃瓶经清洗和处理后还能再用。郊外设有一座专门清洗旧玻璃瓶的工厂，年处理能力为一点三万吨。
    宣传教育：巴黎重视有关垃圾处理的宣传教育工作。市政府及各旅游部门都放着有五种文字说明的卫生规则等宣传品，提醒公众爱护首都的清洁卫生。一张回收玻璃制品的广告上写着：如果每人每月按规定投放两只旧酒瓶，全市一年就可向防癌协会提供五十万法郎的基金。
    此外，市政府还强调从生产领域控制，以减少垃圾的排放量并具体地写在政府的法令上。
