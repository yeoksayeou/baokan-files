Soviet Union Denies Modernizing Tactical Nuclear Missiles

MOSCOW, Feb. 14 (Xinhua) — The first deputy director of the Soviet Foreign Ministry's Press Department, Perfiliev, today denied at a press conference that the Soviet Union is modernizing tactical nuclear missiles.

He made this denial in response to NATO's accusations. He said that since the Soviet Union is taking unilateral disarmament measures and expressing its willingness to destroy various offensive conventional weapons, NATO does not need to possess tactical nuclear weapons.

The spokesman instead accused NATO of actively seeking to modernize such weapons. He believes that the negotiations on reducing conventional forces in Europe, scheduled for March, can also create good conditions for serious dialogue on the issue of tactical nuclear weapons.

Genscher Says "Lance" Short-Range Missiles Will Continue to Be Used

BONN, Feb. 14 (Xinhua) — West German Foreign Minister Genscher today said in a speech on Deutsche Welle radio that the 88 "Lance" short-range missiles deployed in West Germany can be used until 1995, and there is currently no time pressure to update this weapon system.

Genscher said that the important thing now is to pass an overall plan for arms reduction and control at the NATO summit in May. Genscher, when discussing Western differences on the issue of short-range missile modernization, said that attitudes towards updating the "Lance" missiles should not be used as a standard for loyalty to the Western alliance.

Today, the chairman of the West German opposition Social Democratic Party, Vogel, criticized the government's ambiguous stance on the issue of short-range missile modernization. He said that the Social Democratic Party will urge the government to make a clear decision in parliament. He also said that the Social Democratic Party advocates disarmament and also advocates a "zero option" solution for missiles.

The issue of modernizing "Lance" short-range missiles has been a point of contention within the Western alliance since the United States and the Soviet Union reached an agreement to destroy intermediate-range missiles in 1987. Recently, the debate on this issue has intensified. U.S. Secretary of State Baker recently said during his shuttle diplomacy visits to NATO allies that the issue of short-range missile modernization is an important topic in his discussions with relevant country leaders and is also a focus of public attention. Baker said yesterday to American reporters that clarifying the issue of short-range missile modernization still requires consultation.

### 苏否认在使战术核导弹现代化  根舍说将继续使用“长矛”短导

　　苏否认在使战术核导弹现代化    
    根舍说将继续使用“长矛”短导
    新华社莫斯科２月１４日电  苏联外交部新闻局第一副局长佩尔菲利耶夫今天在新闻发布会上否认苏联在使战术核导弹现代化。
    他是针对北约的这一指责而作此否认的。他说，由于苏联正在采取单方面的裁军措施，并表示要销毁各种进攻性的常规武器，北约就没有必要拥有战术核武器了。
    这位发言人反而指责北约有人正积极地想使这种武器现代化。他认为，将于３月举行的削减欧洲常规军备的谈判，也可为就战术核武器问题进行认真的对话创造良好的条件。
    新华社波恩２月１４日电　西德外长根舍今天在德意志电台发表谈话说，部署在西德的８８枚“长矛”短程导弹可用到１９９５年，目前不存在更新这一武器系统的时间压力。
    根舍说，现在重要的问题是要在５月份的北约首脑会议上通过一项裁军和军备控制总体方案。根舍在谈到西方对短导现代化问题的分歧时说，对更新“长矛”导弹的态度不应成为是否忠于西方联盟的标准。
    西德反对党社民党主席福格尔今天指责政府在短导现代化问题上态度暖昧。他说，社民党将在议会敦促政府作出明确的抉择。他还说，社民党主张裁军，也主张对导弹再采取一个“零点”解决办法。
    “长矛”短程导弹现代化问题是１９８７年美苏达成销毁中程导弹协定以来西方联盟中的一个争论点。近来，在这个问题上的争论又趋激烈。美国新任国务卿贝克最近在对北约盟国的穿梭访问中说，短导现代化问题是其同有关国家领导人会谈的重要内容，同时也是舆论注意的焦点。贝克昨天对美国记者说，要澄清短导现代化问题尚需磋商。
