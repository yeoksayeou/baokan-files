In recent years, Henan Province has seen a significant reduction in the number of dangerous school buildings in its primary and secondary schools due to the attention given by leaders at all levels to improving the basic conditions for education, and the active support of the masses for the development of education. Various regions have raised a total of over 3.6 billion yuan, reducing the proportion of dangerous school buildings from 33% to 1.37%. It is expected that all dangerous school buildings in the province will be eliminated by the end of this year.

Ten years ago, dangerous school buildings accounted for approximately one-third of the total school building area in Henan Province's primary and secondary schools. According to calculations by the provincial education department, if relying solely on national educational funds to solve these dangerous school building issues, it would take 100 years. However, by adopting multi-channel fundraising methods, the province allocated over 2.7 billion yuan last year alone for the renovation of dangerous school buildings in primary and secondary schools.

At the beginning of last year, Henan Province Governor Cheng Weigao convened a special meeting to set a deadline for solving the dangerous school building problem in various regions. Deputy Governor Yu Youxian and the responsible officials of the provincial education department conducted investigations in remote mountainous areas with poor teaching conditions, treating the resolution of dangerous school buildings as a major educational issue. Many cities, prefectures, and counties, despite their tight financial and material resources, allocated special funds, steel, timber, cement, and other materials for the renovation of dangerous school buildings in primary and secondary schools.

The implementation of a comprehensive target management responsibility system is another effective measure taken by Henan Province to eliminate dangerous school buildings within a set timeframe. Last year, Henan Province formulated a three-year comprehensive renovation and construction plan for primary and secondary schools. Various cities, prefectures, counties, and townships signed target responsibility contracts at each level, overcoming the past mindset of waiting, relying, and begging. They reported the dangerous school building situation to all the masses, relying on the masses to raise funds through multiple channels, totaling over 3.6 billion yuan. This amount is equivalent to 70% of the total educational funds allocated to primary and secondary schools in China over the past 10 years and is mainly used for the renovation of dangerous school buildings and the construction of new school buildings. The masses say that in the field of education, the achievements of the past 10 years surpass those of the past 30 years.

　　采取多渠道筹资　签订目标责任书    
    河南中小学危房大幅度减少
    新华社郑州２月１６日电  （记者陈朝中）河南省近年来由于各级领导重视改善基础教育办学条件，群众积极支持发展教育事业，各地共筹集资金３６亿多元，中小学危房比例已由３３％下降到１．３７％，全省中小学将在今年内消除危房。
    １０年前，河南省中小学危房约占校舍总面积的１／３。据省教委匡算，如单靠国家教育经费解决这些危房需要１００年。采取多渠道筹资方法后，去年全省用于改造中小学危房的资金就达２．７亿多元。
    去年初，河南省长程维高召开专门会议，限期各地解决中小学危房问题。副省长于友先和省教委的负责人，深入教学条件差的边远山区调查，把解决中小学危房当成教育上的大事来抓。不少地、市、县在财力物力十分紧张的情况下，拨出专款、钢材、木材、水泥等钱物，用于中小学危房改造。
    全面推行目标管理责任制，是河南限期消除中小学危房的又一办法。去年河南省制订出中小学三年改造建设总体规划，各市、地、县、乡层层签订目标责任书，克服过去等、靠、要的依赖思想。他们把学校危房情况通报全体群众，依靠群众多渠道筹措资金３６亿多元，相当于１０年来我国拨中小学教育经费支出总和的７０％，并主要用于改造危房、建设校舍。群众说，在教育上近１０年办的事情，比过去３０年办的还多。
