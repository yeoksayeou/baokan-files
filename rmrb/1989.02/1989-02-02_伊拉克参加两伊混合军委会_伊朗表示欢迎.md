Iraq Participates in the Iran-Iraq Joint Military Commission
Iran Welcomes the Move

NEW DELHI, Jan. 31 (Xinhua) — Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said today at a press conference here that Iraq's decision to participate in the Iran-Iraq Joint Military Commission is a "positive step" towards peace talks between the two countries. Iraq announced on Jan. 29 that it had decided to join the Joint Military Commission proposed by UN Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar.

It is reported that the establishment of this commission will pave the way for discussions on the timetable for the withdrawal of troops from the common border areas of the two countries.

Iran claims that Iraq is currently occupying 1,000 square kilometers of Iranian territory. Since the ceasefire between the two countries in August last year, negotiations have been at a standstill due to disagreements over the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 598.

　　伊拉克参加两伊混合军委会
    伊朗表示欢迎
    新华社德黑兰１月３１日电  伊朗外长韦拉亚提今天在这里举行的记者招待会上说，伊拉克决定参加两伊混合军事委员会是对两国和谈采取的“积极步骤”。伊拉克于１月２９日宣布，它已经决定参加由联合国秘书长佩雷斯·德奎利亚尔建议组成的混合军事委员会。
    据悉，该委员会的组成将为讨论确定两国军队撤离共同边界地区的时间表铺平道路。
    伊朗声称，伊拉克目前占领着伊朗的１０００平方公里领土。两伊自去年８月实现停火以来，由于双方对如何执行联合国安理会５９８号决议有分歧，和谈一直陷于僵局。
