Tianjin Expands Production of Secondary Food Products and Establishes a Complete Supply System

	The People's Daily reports: Correspondent Xiao Zhi reports: Tianjin decided at the end of January to take comprehensive and coordinated measures to vigorously build a relatively complete system for the production and supply of secondary food products to ensure effective supply.

	At a recent rural work conference in Tianjin, several hundred attendees unanimously agreed that large cities are not only unstable without grain but also anxious without vegetables. Although Tianjin's secondary food product base has made initial progress, it is basically still in a traditional and scattered production and operation mode, resulting in inconsistent supply.

	Li Ruihong, Secretary of the Tianjin Municipal Committee and Mayor, said at the meeting: To fundamentally change the passive and short supply situation of secondary food products, we must study it as a comprehensive system and solve it with modern means. He emphasized the need to unify thinking and deepen reforms. Tianjin's suburban counties should adhere to the direction of urban-suburban economy, and bring various work into the track of taking secondary food product production as the focus and serving the city and ensuring effective supply as the goal. In terms of policy, the comprehensive implementation of the linkage policy for the procurement of secondary food products should be fully implemented, and the supply of agricultural production materials, subsidies for agricultural and sideline products, and preferential policies for supporting township enterprises should be bundled together, and fully linked with the production and procurement of major secondary food products such as meat, eggs, and vegetables. He announced that Tianjin will increase agricultural construction funds by 15% this year despite tight funds in all aspects, raise the proportion of local fiscal revenue retention in suburban counties from 34% to 46.5%, and use the tax lever to allocate 10% each before and after tax from the income of township enterprises to support agriculture and secondary food product production.

　　天津扩大副食品生产  建立完善的供应体系
    本报讯  记者肖荻报道：天津市１月底决定采取综合配套措施，大力建设较完善的副食品生产供应体系，以保证有效供给。
    在最近召开的天津农村工作会议上，几百名与会者一致认为：大城市不仅“无粮不稳”，而且“无菜也慌”。天津副食品基地虽有初步发展，但基本上还处于传统的分散的生产经营方式，以致供应时好时差。
    天津市委书记、市长李瑞环在会上说：为了从根本上摆脱副食品供应被动和短缺的局面，必须把它作为一个综合的系统进行研究，采用现代化手段加以解决。他强调要统一思想，深化改革。天津郊县要坚持城郊型经济方向，把各项工作纳入以副食品生产为重点、以服务城市、保证有效供给为目标的轨道。在政策上要全面落实副食品收购的挂钩政策，把农用生产资料的供应、农副产品的补贴和支持乡镇企业的优惠政策捆在一起，同肉、蛋、菜等主要副食品的生产和收购全面挂钩。他宣布，天津今年在各方面资金紧缩情况下，农业建设资金要增加１５％，郊县财政收入留成比例由３４％提到４６．５％，并利用税收杠杆，在乡镇企业收入中税前和税后各列支１０％，用以支持农业和副食品生产。
