Title: Amidst the Vibrancy and Festivity

It's the New Year again. Chinese people still habitually refer to celebrating the Spring Festival and the old year as "celebrating the New Year." How can one not reminisce about the past, cherish old memories, and long for the old? How can one not rejoice in the new, anticipate the new, and welcome the new? How can one not recall childhood memories? Celebrating the New Year involves honoring ancestors, eating dumplings, and setting off firecrackers. In recent years, watching television during the New Year has become so widespread among Chinese people that it seems to have overshadowed other customs.

On the eve of New Year's Eve, the editor of "Earth" called, asking if I could say a few words or write a thousand or so characters for the New Year's Eve television broadcast. I readily agreed, thinking it would be easy. Just speak well if it's good, and speak poorly if it's not. A few plain words would suffice. After watching the broadcast at midnight and entering the first day of the New Year, I found that I couldn't write a single word; I only felt that it was very good, very vibrant, very lively, and very enjoyable. It was filled with laughter, and there were a few tears of joy. I don't want to make comparisons, whether with previous years or with other performances. I can't compare who is funnier between my colleagues and old friends, Chen Peisi and Zhu Shimao. I understand the difficulties faced by the organizers; it's hard to please everyone, but they managed to do so. It's like presenting a hotpot with various ingredients, throwing in everything—folk, classical, ethnic, foreign, elegant, and popular. Everything can be blended together, and each can still be distinguished, providing something for everyone.

I watched with my wife, daughters, and grandchildren. My two-year-old grandson, who just had his birthday, shouted "Advertisement, advertisement!" at the television, regardless of the program. I think he didn't intend to mock or criticize the commercialization of art; he just lacked the vocabulary. But we shouldn't underestimate the simplicity of children, as it can sometimes be as profound as a philosopher's insight.

Tonight, I only ask for liveliness and joy. I ask for the celebration of life because it is the night of welcoming spring. Of course, if a country or a nation only allows its arts to celebrate, it will spoil itself and its descendants, turning everything into "advertisements"!

Enough of the criticism, that's my bad habit as a writer. My grandson is innocent, full of purity. Of course, I am also sincere.

Tonight, I am filled with joy and gratitude: Who invented the "Spring Festival Gala"? It's truly amazing! Who invented television? Who invented electricity? Who invented "Soviet plus electrification"?... I am full of gratitude for all the thoughts and actions that promote modernization.

Tonight, the program that interested me the most and for which I am most grateful was the segment after midnight where the hosts and the audience met. Whether they were familiar or had seen them on screen, they all seemed like family, only separated by different jobs and working hours, rarely able to reunite. Tonight's gathering showed who had gained weight, who had lost weight, who remained pure, who remained elegant, and who was "full of emotions, laughing at my early graying hair"...

I went to bed with happiness, laughter, and liveliness, dreaming from the year of the Snake to the year of the Horse. The dream was peaceful, returning to an era without television or electricity, reciting ancient verses: "In the mountains on New Year's Eve, there is nothing special to do, just plant some plum blossoms and celebrate the New Year." That's also good, isn't it?

People's demands are truly diverse and complex. We should not favor the past over the present, nor should we favor the present over the past. We should not simplify things, nor should we only allow praise. We should not be all hot without any cold, nor all cold without any hot...

　　红火热闹之余
    黄宗江
    又过年了，中国人还是习于把过春节，过旧年，称为过年，能不忆旧怀旧恋旧？又能不喜新盼新迎新？……能不忆儿时？过年祭祖先，过年吃饺子，过年放鞭炮……近年来，过年看电视，其普及性对中国人来说，似乎盖了帽儿地盖过了其他习俗。
    除夕前夕，《大地》编辑来了电话，问能不能为除夕电视说上几句，或写个千把字？我顺口就答应了，心想那还不容易，见好说好，不好就说不好，说上几句大白话也就是了。午夜观罢，进入初一，却觉得一个字也写不出来了；只感到挺好、挺红火、挺热闹，看得挺开心也就是了，充满了欢笑，又有几点泪珠含笑。我不想做比较，比往年，比同台，我可比不上来。比一比我的同行同事、老朋友也是小朋友的陈佩斯和朱时茂谁比谁更逗，我也比不上来。我懂得主事者的艰难，众口难调，但他们毕竟调出来了，像是端出来一个过年常吃的什锦火锅，什么都撩进来了，什么民间的、殿堂的、民族的、外来的、典雅的、通俗的……均能熔于一炉，仍可各辨其味，以供各取所需。
    我是和我的老伴、女儿们、外孙们围观的。昨天刚过了两周岁生日的小孙子憨憨冲着电视无论什么节目都高喊：“广告，广告！”我想他无意讽刺或影射艺术商业化的倾向，他只是缺少语汇；但也不可轻视，幼儿的单纯有时候能近似哲学家的精辟。
    今夜我只要求热闹、欢乐，我要求歌颂生活，因为是报春之夜；当然，一个国家、一个民族如只允许它的文艺歌颂，那可要把自己和自己的子孙都宠坏了，那可真的都成了“广告”啦！
    得了，别横戳直指了，那是我的文人恶习，我的孙子却是无意，一片天真。当然，我也是至诚的。
    今夜我充满了欢乐、感激的心情：是谁发明的“春节联欢晚会”？可真了不起！谁发明的电视？谁发明的电？谁发明的“苏维埃加电气化”？……我对一切促进了现代化的思想行为，都充满了感激的心情。
    今夜，我最感兴趣、最感激的节目，是在午夜后，那一场节目主持人和观众的见面。不论是相识的，或在屏幕上见过的，都像是自己的一家人，只因为工种工时不同，难得团圆。今夜小聚，只见谁胖了些，谁瘦了些，谁还是那么纯朴，谁还是那么标致，谁又是“多情应笑我早生华发”……辛苦了！为人们辛苦地工作是何等的幸福！
    我带着幸福，带着欢笑与热闹，入梦，从戊辰入梦到己巳。梦里可清静，回到了一个没有电视、没有电的时代，低吟古句：“山中除夕无别事，插了梅花便过年。”那也挺好，是不是？
    人的要求可真是多样的、复杂的，不要厚古薄今，亦无须厚今而薄古；可别简单化，可别只允许歌颂，可别光热不冷，更别光冷不热……
