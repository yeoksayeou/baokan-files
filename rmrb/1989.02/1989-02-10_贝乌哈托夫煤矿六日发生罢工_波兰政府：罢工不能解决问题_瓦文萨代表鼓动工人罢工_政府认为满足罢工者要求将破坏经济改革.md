	Bełchatów Coal Mine workers went on strike on the 6th.
	Polish Government: Strikes cannot solve problems
	Wałęsa's representative incites workers to strike; government believes meeting strikers' demands would disrupt economic reforms

	Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, February 8th – Polish government spokesman Urban emphasized today that strikes cannot solve problems, "Under the pressure of strikes, it is impossible to reach an understanding."

	Urban made these remarks when discussing the expansion of the strike at the Bełchatów Coal Mine in central Poland and the participation of "Round Table Conference" representatives in the strike with the Polish News Agency and foreign journalists.

	The "Round Table Conference," attended by representatives of various Polish social forces, opened in Warsaw on the 6th. That evening, 2,500 mechanical repair workers and transport workers at the largest lignite mining base in Poland, the Bełchatów Coal Mine, announced a strike, demanding wage increases and the legalization of the Solidarity Union. To prevent the situation from escalating, the mine leadership negotiated with the strikers, but due to the inability to meet the strikers' excessive demands, no agreement was reached.

	It is reported that on the 7th, Solidarity Union representative Pietruszka, acting on behalf of former Solidarity Union chairman Wałęsa, went to the Bełchatów Coal Mine to "persuade" the workers. However, he told the strikers, "You are doing well," which resulted in the number of strikers increasing to 7,000–8,000.

	According to the Polish News Agency, due to the strikers cutting off coal supply to the largest power plant in Poland, the Bełchatów Power Plant, 5 of its generators have stopped operating. The plant manager and workers appealed to the strikers to resume work early for the sake of the nation and the people.

	Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, February 8th – Polish government spokesman Urban said at a press conference on the 7th regarding the recent strikes in Poland caused by wage issues that the government is "concerned." If the government meets the strikers' unrealistic demands and yields to "such unreasonable economic pressure," it will "exacerbate inflation" and "affect market balance."

	Urban also said that the government will not provide economic assistance to these factories and units, but will regard the wage disputes and strikes there as disputes between the unit leaders and the strikers. He emphasized that the government will "not abandon this established policy," otherwise, it will cause losses to economic reforms.

	It is also reported that similar strikes have occurred recently at the Lenin Steel Plant in the Krakow province and factories in the Sieradz province.

	According to the Polish official announcement, the number of strikes across the country due to wage issues in January this year has reached 39, an increase of twofold compared to December last year.

　　贝乌哈托夫煤矿六日发生罢工
　  波兰政府：罢工不能解决问题
　  瓦文萨代表鼓动工人罢工　政府认为满足罢工者要求将破坏经济改革
    新华社华沙２月８日电  波兰政府发言人乌尔班今天在这里强调说，罢工解决不了问题，“在罢工的压力下无法达成谅解”。
    乌尔班是今天向波通社和外国记者谈及波兰中部的贝乌哈托夫煤矿工人罢工规模扩大和参加“圆桌会议”代表参与罢工一事时说这番话的。
    由波兰各社会力量代表参加的“圆桌会议”６日在华沙开幕。当天晚上，波兰最大的褐煤开采基地——贝乌哈托夫煤矿的２５００名机械修理工和运输工宣布罢工，要求增加工资和团结工会合法化。为了防止事态扩大，煤矿领导与罢工者进行了谈判，但由于无法满足罢工者过高的要求而未能达成协议。
    据悉，７日正在参加“圆桌会议”的团结工会代表皮耶特什克奉前团结工会主席瓦文萨之命前往贝乌哈托夫煤矿进行“劝说工作”。但他却向罢工者说，“你们干得好”，致使参加罢工的人数已增至７０００—８０００人。
    另据波通社报道，由于罢工者中断了向波兰最大的贝乌哈托夫发电厂供煤，电厂的５台发电机组已停止发电。该厂经理和职工呼吁罢工者从国家和人民利益出发早日恢复工作。
    新华社华沙２月８日电　波兰政府发言人乌尔班７日在记者招待会上谈到目前波兰的一些由于工资问题而引起的罢工事件时说，政府对此“感到不安”，如果满足罢工者的不现实的要求，屈服于“这种无理的经济压力”，那末这将会“加剧通货膨胀”，“影响市场平衡”。
    乌尔班还说，政府决不在经济上资助这些工厂和单位，而把那里的工资纠纷和罢工看作为单位领导和罢工者之间的纠葛。他强调说，政府“不会放弃这一既定政策”，否则就会给经济改革带来损失。
    另据报道，最近在克拉科夫省列宁钢厂和谢拉齐省的工厂也发生了类似的罢工。
    据波兰官方宣布，今年１月波兰全国因工资问题而发生的罢工已达３９起，比去年１２月增加了两倍。
