The Lunar New Year of the Snake has passed, and the Lantern Festival has also passed. This year's festival supplies were generally better than expected, and people's anxieties before the festival have somewhat eased. When meeting acquaintances, the topic of conversation was often "how to celebrate the festival."

"This year, fewer firecrackers were set off, and fewer people were injured." The deafening noise and thick smoke that usually accompany the festival have decreased this year, making it a turning point. This is a progress in how to celebrate the festival.

"Celebrating the festival is too tiring!" Many people sighed. What makes it tiring? It's mainly four words: buying, preparing, eating, and visiting. Before the festival, commercial departments prepare New Year goods, various units also prepare New Year goods, and everyone lines up to buy New Year goods, making it a nationwide "battle." After buying, one has to prepare, and the preparations have to be rich and varied. Housewives and "househusbands" are exhausted, with sore backs and shoulders. After preparing, one has to eat, concentrating on eating well, often turning it into a "task." Good things are not enjoyed properly, and sometimes the stomach is overloaded. This excessive emphasis on "eating" during the festival is not only costly but also harmful to both physical and mental health. From an economic perspective, it is not cost-effective. Another important task during the festival is visiting. Usually, everyone is busy with their own affairs, but during the festival, they meet to "warm up," which is a natural human emotion. However, visiting requires gifts, resulting in not being able to visit everyone; and many visits are purely for courtesy, seeming inappropriate if not done. This adds to the financial and mental burden and waste. The following scenes can be seen as a vivid record of this issue.

How can the festival be celebrated in a way that is both joyful and lively, yet relaxed and carefree? The festival, as a custom, is a form of culture. With the progress of society's economy and culture, the way we celebrate festivals should also become more civilized and scientific. Why can't the not-so-abundant agricultural and sideline products be used more effectively, instead of making people feel stuffed and bored? Why do people who are already tired from their daily work have to follow old habits and become even more exhausted without any benefit? On the basis of national traditions, can we create some new and more meaningful ways to celebrate the festival?

Of course, this is not to say that administrative intervention is needed. How to celebrate the festival is a personal freedom. But one should still consider it. In a television news program, there was a scene where some farmers no longer celebrate the Spring Festival by buying a lot of meat, as they used to, eating a year's worth of meat in one festival. This is a progress.

Changing habits is difficult, but it is not extremely difficult. The progress in setting off firecrackers has shown this. In celebrating festivals, people who are becoming more civilized will always find more civilized ways and methods.

　　年节过后说过节
    文牛
    蛇年的春节过了，元宵节也过了。今年的节日供应总的来说比人们预料的好些，节前人们的某些紧张心理有所缓和。碰见熟人，谈得比较多的是“怎么过节”这个题目。
    “今年放鞭炮的少了，受伤的也少了。”震耳欲聋，硝烟弥漫——节日喜庆转化为噪声和空气污染，这种现象由上升到下降，今年春节是个转折点。这是“怎么过节”方面的一个进步。
    “过节过得太累了！”许多人这样感叹。累在哪里？无非是四个字：买、做、吃、串。节前，商业部门准备年货，各单位另备年货，每个人排队买年货，简直是一场囊括全国的“大战役”。买了就要做，做得要丰富多采，主妇和“主男”们累得腰酸膀疼。做了就要吃，集中吃好的，常常成了“完成任务”，好东西没好吃，甚至把肚子吃出毛病来。这种过分突出“吃”享的过节，既破费大，又对身心无益。从经济学角度看，这是不合算的。过节还有一个重要任务是串门，平时各忙各的，过节见面“热乎热乎”，人之常情。可是，串门就得送礼，结果该串的不敢全串；又有相当多的“串”纯属应酬，似乎不去就不合适。这又加重了财力和精力上的负担和浪费。本文下面这组镜头，可说是这方面问题的形象的实录。
    过节，怎样过得既欢乐、热闹，又轻松、洒脱呢？过节，作为风俗习惯，它是一种文化。随着社会经济和社会文化的进展，节日也应该越来越过得文明、科学。本来并不富裕的农副产品，为什么不可以用得再讲实效些，而非让它把人撑着、腻着不可呢？平时就很劳累的人们，为什么非按照旧的窠臼搞得更加疲劳而无收益呢？在民族传统的基础上，能不能创造一些新的更有意义的过节内容和方法呢？
    当然，这不是说要搞什么行政干预。怎么过节是个人的自由。可是总要捉摸一下。在一个电视新闻片里看到了这样的镜头：某些地方农民再不像过去那样的方法，过春节买很多肉，一个节把一年的肉都吃了。这就是一种进步。
    习惯的改变难，但也不是非常难。放鞭炮的进步就说明了这一点。在欢庆节日上，越来越文明的人们，总会找到越来越文明的方式方法。
