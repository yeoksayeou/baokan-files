BEIJING, Feb. 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bush delivered his first speech to a joint session of Congress tonight, outlining the new government's policy agenda and key measures, and stressing the need for cooperation with Congress to fulfill their shared mission.

Bush said in his address that the challenges facing the U.S. today are different from those of eight years ago. He presented a realistic plan to Congress, highlighting four key points: prioritize key areas, invest in the future, overcome the deficit, and avoid raising taxes.

Regarding the federal budget, Bush said that next year's budget revenue will increase by $80 billion compared to this year, but spending will only see a slight increase to ensure key projects. The goal is to reduce the deficit by 40% to meet the target set by the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act (i.e., the deficit should not exceed $100 billion). To achieve this, the Bush administration will work with Congress to form a special leadership team for sincere negotiations to develop a two-year budget plan. He emphasized that high spending and high taxes harm economic growth and should not be adopted.

The focus of Bush's speech was on domestic issues. He outlined the main measures the new government must take:

1. Promote basic research to ensure U.S. leadership in technology. Bush proposed allocating $2.2 billion to the National Science Foundation and increasing NASA's budget by $2.4 billion for space programs.

2. Reduce the capital gains tax rate to encourage long-term investment. Bush said that increasing investment is crucial for increasing income, creating jobs, and maintaining competitiveness.

3. Reorganize education methods to improve the education system. To reward excellent schools and teachers, the government will allocate special funds and establish the "Presidential Special Award." Bush expressed his willingness to be the "Education President" and hoped Congress would also be the "Education Congress."

4. Strengthen anti-drug efforts from all fronts to eliminate drug harm. Bush said that in 1988, 23 million people nationwide used drugs, severely damaging national health. He requested an additional $1 billion for anti-drug efforts and vowed to work with the Drug Enforcement Administration to crack down on drug traffickers.

5. Protect the environment and adopt a new attitude towards it. The Bush administration will soon submit a new and more effective Clean Air Act to Congress, aiming to reduce emissions that cause acid rain and cooperate with Canada to develop clean coal technology. To protect parks and oceans, the Attorney General and the EPA Administrator will "spare no effort to accelerate and strongly enforce laws against dumping toxic waste," severely punishing environmental polluters. Bush also promised to double the funding to address the long-neglected issue of nuclear weapon factory waste.

6. Improve social relief and social insurance. Bush pledged to allocate an additional $3 billion to the Medicaid program to assist pregnant women on the poverty line and encourage the adoption of abandoned or abused children, providing tax incentives for adoption expenses. Bush guaranteed the continuation of the Social Security program for the elderly, care for the homeless, and increased funding for emergency food and housing assistance.

Regarding the military budget, Bush reaffirmed the policy of "seeking a more solid peace through strength." He said that military spending has actually decreased over the past four years, and due to the urgent need to reduce the deficit, he will freeze the military budget for one year but increase it afterward. Bush stated, "I will not sacrifice U.S. military strength or make concessions on U.S. strength issues." He has instructed the National Security Council to review national security and defense policies and submit a report within 90 days to ensure that military capabilities and resources meet U.S. strategic needs.

Another aspect of Bush's speech was foreign relations. He said, "Defending a more peaceful world" is his biggest priority. He noted that the U.S. is facing a "time of great hope" and a "time of global change." The U.S. needs to understand the full implications of changes in the Soviet Union, review its policy towards the Soviet Union, and then proceed with caution. Bush said, "We will not miss any opportunity to seek peace." He has instructed the Secretary of State to visit Europe next week to consult with allies on "broad challenges and opportunities" facing the U.S. and Europe, including East-West relations. Additionally, Bush expressed support for the Strategic Defense Initiative and believed that the proliferation and use of precision weapons pose an increasing threat to "global security." He advocated for the elimination and prohibition of chemical weapons, stopping the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and supporting self-determination and democracy in Central America.

Regarding his upcoming visit to China, Bush said that the vast changes in China were almost unimaginable when he served as the U.S. representative to China 14 or 15 years ago.

During his speech, Bush received repeated applause from members of both parties in Congress. House Speaker, Democratic leader Wright, and senior Democratic Senator Bentsen expressed their support for President Bush in addressing the deficit, education, drugs, and social welfare issues, and said they were willing to work with the Bush administration to find common solutions.

    提出新政府施政纲领和主要措施
    外交：以实力求和平审查对苏政策
    内政：促进基础科研　保证技术领先
    　　　降低增值税率　鼓励长期投资
    　　　重新规划教育　愿当教育总统

    本报华盛顿２月９日电　记者张启昕、仓立德报道：美国总统布什今晚向国会参众两院联席会议发表他就职后的首次演说，全面提出新政府的施政纲领和主要措施，强调要与国会通力合作，肩负起共同的使命。
    布什在讲话中说，今天美国面临的挑战与８年前不同，他今晚向国会提出的是一个讲求现实的计划，包括４个特点：重视重点，投资未来，战胜赤字，决不增税。
    在谈到联邦预算时，布什说，下个年度的预算收入将比本年度增加８００亿美元，但只能小幅度增加开支，保证关键性项目，同时要削减赤字４０％，以达到国会平衡预算法规定的目标（即赤字不超过１０００亿美元）。为此，布什政府将与国会一起工作，组织一个特别领导班子，真诚协商，以便及时形成一项两个年度的预算方案。他说，高开支、高税收危害经济增长，这种方法不能采取。
    布什讲话的重点是国内问题。他提出新政府必须采取的主要措施是：
    一，促进基础科研，保证美国在技术领域的领先地位。布什提出为全国科学基金会拨款２２亿美元，为航空航天局和空间计划增加２４亿美元经费。
    二，降低资本增值税的税率，鼓励长期性投资。布什说，只有增加投资，才能增加收入、创造就业，才有竞争力。
    三，重新规划教育方法，改善教育事业。为了奖励优秀学校和教师，政府将拨专款并设立“总统特别奖”。布什说他愿意成为“教育总统”，也希望国会成为“教育国会”。
    四，从各条战线加强扫毒，清除毒品祸害。布什说，１９８８年全国有２３００万人吸毒，严重损害民族健康。他要求增加１０亿美元经费用于扫毒，表示将同缉毒总监并肩战斗，对贩毒分子绝不手软。
    五，保护环境，保护未来，对环境采取新态度。布什政府不久将向国会递交一项新的、更为有效的清洁空气法案，限期减少导致酸雨的废气排放量，并同加拿大合作开发干净利用煤炭技术。为了保护公园、海洋，司法部长和环保局长将“不遗余力加速并强有力地执行反对倾倒有毒废物的法律”，严惩污染环境者。布什还表示要加倍拨款，着手解决忽视多年的核武器工厂废料的难题。
    六，改进社会救济与社会保险。布什表示要为医疗援助计划增拨３０亿美元，以照顾那些处于贫困线边缘的怀孕妇女，并鼓励收养遭到遗弃或虐待的、失去父母的儿童，在收养费用上给予减税优待。布什保证继续执行老年人社会保险计划，关心无家可归者，增加紧急食品、住房救济款。
    在谈到军事预算时，布什重申“以实力求得更为牢固的和平”方针。他说，军事开支实际上在过去４年里已经减少，目前由于“削减赤字的迫切需要”他将冻结军事预算１年，但此后要增加。布什说，“我不会牺牲美国的军备，不会在美国实力问题上让步”。他已指示国家安全委员会审查国家安全和防务政策，在９０天内提出报告，以保证军事能力和资源能符合美国的战略需要。
    布什讲话的另一个方面是对外关系问题。他说，“保卫一个更为和平的世界”是他要讲的最大重点。他说，美国正面临一个“巨大希望的时代”，一个“世界巨变的时代”。美国要了解苏联变化的全部含义，审查对苏政策，“然后小心前进”。布什说，“我们不会失去任何争取和平的机会”。他已命国务卿下周访问欧洲，与盟国就美欧共同面临的“广泛挑战和机遇”进行磋商，其中包括东西方关系问题。此外，布什还表示支持“战略防御计划”，并认为精密武器的扩散和使用对“全球安全”的威胁增大。他主张清除并禁止使用化学武器，停止核武器扩散。他支持中美洲实行“自决和民主”。
    在谈到他即将访问的中国时，布什说，中国发生如此大范围的变化，这在十四五年前他担任美国驻华代表时，极少人能够预见得到。
    布什在讲话时不断受到国会两党议员的鼓掌欢迎。众院议长、民主党领袖赖特和参院民主党资深议员本特森当晚表示，支持布什总统解决赤字、教育、毒品、社会福利等问题，并说他们愿意同布什政府一起努力以寻求共同的解决方法。
