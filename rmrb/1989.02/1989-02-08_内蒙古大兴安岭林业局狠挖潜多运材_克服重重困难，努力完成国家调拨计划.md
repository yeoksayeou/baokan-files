The Inner Mongolia Greater Khingan Mountains Forestry Management Bureau, prioritizing national interests, has overcome numerous difficulties to successfully complete the 1988 timber transportation plan. The bureau transported 18.9 million cubic meters of raw logs to the state, achieving a plan fulfillment rate that ranks among the highest in the nation.

1988 was the most challenging year for rail transportation in the Inner Mongolia Greater Khingan Mountains forestry area. The shortage of rail cars was severe. Based on timber production and storage conditions, at least 110,000 rail cars were needed; however, the railway department allocated only 84,796 cars, 19,000 fewer than planned, resulting in a potential shortfall of over 1 million cubic meters of timber. Last summer, the region experienced its largest flood in history, causing a halt in production, loading, and transportation for over 20 days, leading to significant economic losses. By the end of September, only 60% of the annual state-allocated timber plan had been completed.

Faced with these adverse conditions, the forestry management bureau strictly adhered to national regulations ensuring the transportation of state-planned timber. On one hand, they strengthened cooperation with the railway department, exploring every possible means to maximize transportation potential. They repaired damaged cars, expanded operating hours, insisted on nighttime loading, and increased the load per car by 1.28 meters compared to 1987, thereby transporting an additional 100,000 cubic meters of timber. On the other hand, they balanced the state-allocated and non-state-allocated timber plans on a seasonal and monthly basis, prioritizing the transportation of timber contracted with the state. In the fourth quarter of last year, they identified four forestry bureaus with outstanding state-allocated timber transportation tasks and immediately stopped allocating non-state-allocated timber rail cars to these bureaus. In the last four months of the year, the entire forestry area dispatched over 22,000 rail cars of timber, ensuring the completion of the state timber transportation tasks.

　　内蒙古大兴安岭林业局狠挖潜多运材
　　克服重重困难，努力完成国家调拨计划
    本报讯  内蒙古大兴安岭林业管理局以国家利益为重，努力克服困难，出色地完成了１９８８年木材调运计划，共运出国家上调原木１８９万余立方米，计划兑现率在全国同行业中名列前茅。
    １９８８年是内蒙古大兴安岭林区历史上铁路运输形势最紧张的一年，车皮严重不足。按木材生产和库存情况来看，至少需要１１万个车皮；实际上铁路部门分配了８４７９６个车皮，比计划少１９０００多个车皮，仅此一项将少运１００多万立方米木材。去年夏天这个林区又发生了历史上最大的洪水灾害，停产、停装、停运达２０多天，给企业造成了很大的经济损失。到去年９月底仅完成国拨材年计划的６０％。
    在多种不利的客观条件下，这个林管局严格执行国家有关保证国家计划运输的规定，一方面加强同铁路部门的协作，千方百计挖掘调运潜力，修复坏车，扩大作业时间，坚持夜间装车，提高载量，使平均载量比１９８７年提高１．２８米／车，仅此一项运出木材１０万多立方米。另一方面他们按季、月平衡国拨材和非统配材计划，优先保证与国家签约的木材调运。去年第四季度，他们发现有４个林业局国拨材调运欠账，便立即停配了这些林业局的非统配材的车皮。去年全林区最后４个月共发运２２０００多车木材，从而保证了国家木材调运任务的完成。
