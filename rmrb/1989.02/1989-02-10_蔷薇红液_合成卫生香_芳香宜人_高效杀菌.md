A type of high-efficiency disinfectant, "Rose Red Liquid," extracted from natural plants, has been developed. When added in appropriate amounts to wooden sanitary incense, it creates a highly effective disinfecting incense. This incense recently passed technical appraisal.

This incense, invented by Beijing Adult Education Institute engineer Li Bao'an, not only fills the room with a pleasant fragrance during combustion but also effectively kills multiple types of bacteria and purifies the air. When used in households, it can prevent illness and promote health. When used in hospitals, clinics, hotels, kindergartens, and other public places, it can prevent cross-infection. When burned in sufficient quantities (0.05 grams per cubic meter of space), it can make operating rooms and laboratories in hospitals meet the requirements for aseptic operations. The People's Liberation Army Air Force General Hospital used this method to replace other drugs for disinfecting operating rooms, and in the past two years, there have been no cases of infection. According to toxicological experiments conducted by the Beijing Municipal Health and Epidemic Prevention Station, it is safe for humans and animals.

Experts who participated in the appraisal believe that the production process of this incense is simple, the raw materials are abundant, and the price is low. Once promoted, it will have a good social effect.

　　“蔷薇红液”合成卫生香
　  芳香宜人　高效杀菌
    本报讯  一种从天然植物中优选提炼出高效杀菌剂——“蔷薇红液”，适量注入木质卫生香精而制成的高效杀菌卫生香，前不久通过技术鉴定。
    这种由北京市成人教育学院工程师李保安发明的卫生香，在燃烧过程中不仅满室芳香，而且有高效杀灭多种病菌和净化空气的作用。用于家庭居室，可防病保健；用于病房、门诊部、旅馆、幼儿园等公共场所，可避免交叉感染。足量燃烧（每立方米空间点燃０．０５克），可使医院手术室、实验室达到无菌操作的要求。人民解放军空军总医院用这种方法代替其它药物对手术室进行消毒，两年来无一例感染。经北京市卫生防疫站毒理科毒理学实验证明，它对人畜安全无害。
    参加鉴定的专家们认为这种卫生香生产工艺简便，原料来源充足，价格低廉，推广后会有较好的社会效益。    （力坤）
