Czechoslovakia has achieved initial success in its nationwide anti-smoking campaign, launched last year under the slogan "Giving Hope to Three Million People."

According to reports, 6% of smokers have quit, 19% have reduced their smoking, 28% no longer smoke in front of children, and 14% refrain from smoking in front of non-smokers.

The success of the anti-smoking campaign is also reflected in the decrease in tobacco sales.

To protect the health of the people and the growth of the next generation, Czechoslovakia plans to continue this campaign and include relevant anti-smoking regulations in the legal draft. The draft clearly stipulates that smoking is prohibited in public places and in the presence of non-smokers, with fines for violations.

    新华社布拉格二月十二日电  捷克斯洛伐克从去年起，在给“三百万人以希望”的口号下，在全国广泛开展反吸烟活动已获初步成果。
    据报道，百分之六的瘾君子已戒掉恶习，百分之十九的人控制了吸烟量，百分之二十八的人不再在儿童面前吸烟，百分之十四的人不在非吸烟者面前抽烟。
    反吸烟活动的成果还表现为烟的销售量下降。
    为保护人民健康和下一代茁壮成长，捷准备将这一活动继续开展下去，并将反吸烟的有关条例写进法律草案。草案明确规定，禁止在公共场所吸烟，不许在非吸烟者面前吸烟，违者罚款。
