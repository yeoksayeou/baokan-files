Also on the "Melon Seed Art"

    Jiao Yongfu

    After reading Comrade Liu Xinwu's short article about the CCTV Spring Festival Gala (February 11, People's Daily, 8th edition), I also have a few things to say.

    I think that defining the CCTV Spring Festival Gala as "Melon Seed Art" is a very apt and brilliant discovery. Naturally, whether it is melon seeds or hazelnuts, if it is called art, it must first be art. However, by defining it this way, all parties can have a roughly similar standard, and things can be handled much more easily. The directors do not have to hope to achieve great national prosperity with just one gala, and thus be sincerely frightened and at a loss; the leaders do not have to worry about a few rotten melon seeds in a plate of melon seeds and commit the error of "not guarding the gate strictly," and thus be trembling with fear. As for the audience, they also do not have to demand that it have the nobility of cooking large prawns, the nutrition of braised pork hocks, and the richness of tofu fish. Although it has sweet, salty, and five-spice flavors, it is still melon seeds. As long as it can make you happy and laugh heartily, it is enough. In this way, the problem of "too many mouths to please" can also be solved. Isn't it? On that night of "one night connecting two years, five watches dividing two years," after a good meal, the whole family sits in front of the TV to watch the show, just like sitting with more relatives and friends chatting, laughing heartily, and being excited to the point of shedding a few tears of joy. "Joy is short, loneliness is long," the melon seed art should give people joy, ease, dispel stagnation, regulate the body, and resolve external issues, making people happily enter the new year.

    Using this standard to evaluate this year's CCTV Spring Festival Gala, I dare to speak frankly, it can be said that there are melon seeds but no art, or it can only be said that it is a plate of melon seeds of medium quality but leaning towards the lower end. Among them, there are indeed a few melon seeds that are full, thick, and fragrant, but many are indeed dry and bland, and some are not only bland but also have a bad taste. Saying that the entire gala is artistically mediocre, ideologically pale, and emotionally exaggerated is not an overstatement.

    Su Shi once said, "The joys of the world are endless, and one can find pleasure in them." I think this is also suitable for the CCTV Spring Festival Gala. But to make the gala suitable for people's interests, it is still necessary to start from life, understand the thoughts and emotions of the masses, see what they are thinking and how they are thinking. The key is to work hard on creation. Over the years, I have accumulated an impression that I always feel that our TV art creation has a common problem, that is, it is too far from the thoughts and feelings of the people, the tone is too high, and the self-feeling is too good, making people very uncomfortable after watching. This year's CCTV Spring Festival Gala is no exception. If we were to take the pulse of the CCTV Spring Festival Gala, we could immediately see that the overall artistic conception has already fallen into a formula, and each program's creation and arrangement lacks depth and skill. Obviously, this is related to not working hard enough on creation. Naturally, the source of TV programs relies on society and spontaneous submissions; on the other hand, it is also necessary to organize key creations with a clear mind and focus. The current social life is both rich and colorful and bizarre, and the lack of good works can only be said to be due to not working hard enough. However, this is also related to the directors' excessive belief in the advanced media techniques, over-reliance on the self-promotion and self-embellishment of the scene. Naturally, the advanced technology of TV media is undeniable. For example, it can cross time and space, say whatever it wants, have whatever it wants, and the embellishment and promotion can be lively and festive, with thunderous applause. But techniques and embellishment cannot replace art itself. From the scene, the lights, stage sets, various colors, and greenery, the audience on the scene is a gathering of scholars, young and old, hands clapping non-stop, mouths not closing, and the atmosphere is the most lively in the world. But I suspect that this small atmosphere of live broadcast is too far from the thoughts and feelings of the billions of viewers in front of the TV. I think that forcing joy to create laughter is even more disgusting. If this gives people the impression of two completely different worlds, the social effect would be detrimental.

    If I were to prescribe a remedy for the CCTV Spring Festival Gala, I would like to quote what Mr. Lu Xun said in "The Secret of Composition," that is: "Contrary to the trickery: have genuine meaning, remove ornamentation, be less affected, and do not show off." What do you think?

　　也谈“瓜籽艺术”
    焦勇夫
    读了刘心武同志关于电视春节晚会的短文（２月１１日人民日报第８版）之后，我也想说几句。
    我以为，他把电视春节晚会定位为“瓜籽艺术”，是一个十分恰切的天才发现。自然，不论是瓜籽也好，榛子也好，既然称之为艺术，那就首先必须是艺术。不过，经过这样一定位，各方面就可以有一个大致差不多的尺寸，事情就可以比较地好办得多。编导者既不必指望以一台晚会立下兴国之大业，从而诚惶诚恐莫知所措；领导者也无须担心一盘瓜籽中出了几颗发了霉的臭瘪子而犯下“把关不严”的错误，从而战战兢兢。至于观众，也因此就不必要求它具有“烹大虾的高贵，饨肘子的营养，豆瓣鱼的浓酽”，它虽有甜、咸、五香之分，但总归是瓜籽。只要它能使你赏心悦目，博你哈哈一笑，也就尽够了。这样，所谓众口难调的问题，也就可以解决了。可不是吗，当那个“一夜连双岁，五更分二年”的晚上，酒足饭饱之余，一家老小坐在电视机前看玩艺儿，就如同与更多的亲友坐在一起聊大天一样，开心处可以乐得前仰后合，激动时可以落下几滴含笑的泪珠。“欢娱嫌夜短，寂寞恨更长”，瓜籽艺术给人的应该是开心、顺气、化淤、理中、解表，使人高高兴兴地进入新的一年。
    以这个标准来评判今年的电视春节晚会，恕我直言，可以说是有瓜籽没艺术，或者，只能说是一盘质地居中而又偏下的瓜籽儿。其间自然也有几颗瓤满、肉厚、味香的好瓜籽儿，但有好些确实属于干瘪乏味者，还有的就不仅止于乏味，而且有一股不是滋味的滋味儿。说整台晚会，艺术上平庸，思想上苍白，表现上矫情，客气地说起来也并不为过。
    苏辙说过一句话：“天下之乐无穷，可以适意为悦。”我觉得这也适宜于电视春节晚会。但要把晚会办得适合人们的意兴，首先还是要从生活出发，体察一下群众的思想情绪，看他们在想些什么和怎样想，关键还得下功夫抓创作。多年来，我积累了一种印象，我总觉得我们的电视艺术创作有一种通病，就是距离人民思想感情太远，调门过高，自我感觉过分良好，看了之后，使人很不舒服。今年的电视春节晚会也不例外。如果给电视春节晚会切脉的话，一眼就可以看得出来，在总体的艺术构思上，早已落套，而在每个节目的创作和编排上，又缺乏深度和功力。很显然，这和抓创作下功夫不够很有关系。自然，电视节目的作品来源一方面要依靠社会，靠自发来稿；另一方面，也需头脑清醒地、有重点地组织重点创作。当前的社会生活既丰富多彩又光怪陆离，没有好作品，只能说功夫下得不到。然而，这又和编导者过分迷信媒介手段的先进、过分地相信现场的自我渲染、自我烘托的力量大有关系。自然，电视媒介手段的技术先进是无法否认的。例如它可以时空交叉，可以说什么是什么，要什么有什么，渲染和烘托也可以热闹红火，掌声如雷，但手段和渲染都代替不了艺术本身。从现场看，灯光、布景，五颜六色，花花绿绿，现场看客群贤毕至，少长咸集，手不停拍，口不合拢，气氛之热烈，可以居世界之最。但我疑心这个现场直播的小氛围同电视机前的亿万观众的思想感情距离得太远。我以为，为赋新词强说愁固然不好，但为示欢乐强作笑，恐怕就更加令人恶心。假如由此而给人造成截然两个世界的印象，那社会效果可就得不偿失了。
    如果要给电视春节晚会开药方的话，我愿意把鲁迅先生在《作文秘诀》中所说的引过来，即：“和障眼法反一调：有真意，去粉饰，少做作，勿卖弄”。不知以为然否？
