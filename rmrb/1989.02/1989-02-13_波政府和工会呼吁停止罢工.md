Polish Government and Trade Unions Call for Strike Halt

    The Polish government and trade unions have appealed for an end to strikes.

    Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, February 10 - (Reporter Tang Deqiao) The Polish government spokesman Urban today called on workers not to use strikes to resolve wage issues, as strikes "affect production, hinder economic reform, and disrupt social stability." The three-day strike by miners at the Bełchatów Coal Mine ended yesterday, but workers at the "Wacławska" steel plant's electric furnace shop in Katowice, workers at the "M. Nowotko" steel plant in Kielce, and employees of the large department store in Łódź announced strikes today, demanding wage increases.

    Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, February 11 - Polish trade union leaders have visited various locations to meet with workers, urging them not to strike.

    The chairman of the National Coordination Committee of Polish Trade Unions, Miodowicz, today met with workers at the Nowa Sól Power Plant in southern Poland, stating, "The Round Table talks are continuing in Warsaw, and we will soon reach an agreement with the government." Yesterday in Krakow, former Solidarity leader Lech Wałęsa met with university faculty and workers, calling on them "not to hastily announce strikes."
