Edition: 5

Last November, we visited Longxutang Primary School in the eastern district of our city. Seeing the teachers and students studying in classrooms fraught with danger, we felt very distressed. A deputy principal of the school told us: "This school has 14 classes and over 600 teachers and students. Currently, the ceilings of some classrooms often have soil falling off, the indoor lighting is dim, and on rainy days, buckets must be placed throughout the classroom to catch water. On May 19, 1987, the school wall collapsed, injuring 11 students. In addition, gases discharged by the municipal chemical plant, chemical fiber plant, and Zijiang pesticide plant have also severely affected the teachers and students. One day last semester, due to the municipal chemical plant discharging chlorine gas, all teachers and students in the school experienced poisoning symptoms, and a female teacher fainted on the podium."

The teachers and students appeal to the relevant departments to urgently address these issues and create a good teaching environment for them.

### 请为龙须塘小学师生解忧

　　请为龙须塘小学师生解忧
    去年１１月下旬，我们来到我市东区龙须塘小学，看到师生们在险象环生的教室里上课，心里很不是滋味。学校一位副校长向我们介绍说：“这所学校有１４个班级，６００多名师生。目前，一些教室的天花板上的泥土经常脱落，室内光线暗淡，一遇阴天必须全天开灯，雨天教室里要摆满脸盆接水。１９８７年５月１９日，学校围墙倒塌，１１名学生被砸伤。此外，市化工厂、化纤厂以及资江农药厂排放出来的气体也使师生们深受其害。去年上学期的一天，因市化工厂排放氯气，全校师生都有中毒反应，一位女教师被熏昏在讲台上。”
    师生们呼吁有关部门尽快解决这些问题，为他们创造一个良好的教学环境。
