The CPC Central Committee General Secretary Zhao Ziyang visited the famous hometown of overseas Chinese in Jiangmen City and Taishan and Kaiping Counties in Guangdong Province from February 2 to 3 to celebrate the Spring Festival with the local people and overseas Chinese, foreign nationals of Chinese descent, and compatriots from Hong Kong and Macau who are investing in factories, exploring business opportunities, or visiting relatives. He expressed his hope that everyone would work together to build a better hometown.

Jiangmen City administers Taishan and Kaiping Counties, along with Enping, Xinhui, and Heshan Counties, collectively known as the "Five Counties." These counties are one of the major hometowns of overseas Chinese in China. There are 2.8 million overseas Chinese, foreign nationals of Chinese descent, and compatriots from Hong Kong and Macau with ancestral roots in the "Five Counties," residing in over 70 countries and regions.

Zhao Ziyang paid great attention to the development of education in the hometown of overseas Chinese. Accompanied by Guangdong Provincial Committee Secretary Lin Ruo, he visited Jiangmen's Wuyi University, which was established just three years ago. Zhao Ziyang was delighted to see the newly constructed buildings rising from the ground, funded by the "Five Counties" and donations from overseas Chinese. He viewed the school's overall planning model, listened to the principal's report on the school's situation, and expressed his hopes for the school's work. He urged the faculty and staff not to disappoint the enthusiasm of the people of Wuyi and overseas Chinese for establishing the school, and to strive to make the university a success, cultivating more talents for the hometown and contributing to the development of education.

The city of Sanbu in Kaiping County was bustling with a Spring Festival flower market. Along the riverside, oranges and fresh flowers were displayed, creating a festive atmosphere. Zhao Ziyang visited Sanbu and ascended the 17-story Kaiping Building to overlook the cityscape of Sanbu, known as "Little Wuhan" with its three rivers and nine bridges. He then drove to the Si Tu Beauty Hall in the Overseas Chinese Garden to visit the memorial hall of the late famous overseas Chinese leader Si Tu Beauty, paying his respects to the bronze statue of Si Tu Beauty. Zhao Ziyang expressed his admiration for this patriotic overseas Chinese leader who contributed to the birth of New China.

Taishan County has a population of 950,000, with over 1.1 million overseas Chinese, earning it the title of "First Hometown of Overseas Chinese." After entering Taishan from Kaiping, Zhao Ziyang visited the citrus orchard of the Datong Development Company, invested in and established by American Chinese Chen Rongchang, the craft factory in Luobian established by Chen Kunpu using funds from overseas Chinese, and the Taishan Textile Factory, a joint venture with foreign capital. At the Datong Citrus Orchard, Zhao Ziyang told Mr. Chen Rongchang, "Your direction of investing in agriculture is correct. Currently, there are already many people investing in industry, but very few in agriculture. Developing agriculture is also very much needed, and your path is correct!" As he left the citrus orchard, Zhao Ziyang shook hands with Chen Rongchang, wishing him and his family a happy Spring Festival.

While focusing on the economic construction of the hometown of overseas Chinese, Zhao Ziyang also paid great attention to its cultural construction. He visited the culturally rich and architecturally unique cultural district in Taicheng, the seat of the Taishan County government. The library, science and technology museum, museum, youth palace, television university, and educational television station in this district are all educational and cultural facilities built with donations from Taishan compatriots residing in various parts of the world since the country opened up to the outside world. Zhao Ziyang also listened to reports from Jiangmen City Committee Secretary Li Ziliu and Taishan County Committee Secretary Huang Kangjian, and discussed the construction of the hometown with them. He said that the hometown has undergone significant changes, with great developments in its economy and culture, and its various construction projects are thriving. This is the result of resolutely implementing reforms and opening up to the outside world, earnestly implementing policies for overseas Chinese, fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese and their relatives, and giving full play to the advantages of the hometown. In the future, to build a better hometown, we must continue to adhere to reforms and opening up, implement policies for overseas Chinese, and further mobilize the enthusiasm of all parties. He also pointed out that during the period of rectifying economic order and improving the economic environment, the hometown should also implement the policies of the Party and the state. The hometown should analyze its own characteristics, give full play to its advantages, and focus on adjusting the economic structure during the rectification and improvement, with a focus on strengthening management and improving efficiency. He hoped that all hometowns would adhere to the principle of "two hands," vigorously developing socialist commodity economy, and paying attention to ideological work, including strengthening the construction of the Party and spiritual civilization. He said that it is very necessary to do these practical works solidly in the hometown. By adhering to this approach, the construction of the hometown will definitely get better and better.

　　赵紫阳到广东侨乡祝贺春节
　　希望大家同心协力把侨乡建设得更好
    新华社广州２月４日电  （记者牛正武）中共中央总书记赵紫阳于２月２日至３日专程到著名侨乡广东省江门市和台山、开平县，向侨乡人民和来这里投资办厂、探亲旅游的海外华侨、外籍华人、港澳同胞祝贺春节，希望大家同心协力把侨乡建设得更好。
    同属江门市管的台山、开平两县，与恩平、新会、鹤山三县，并称“五邑”，是我国主要侨乡之一。祖籍“五邑”、旅居海外的华侨、外籍华人、港澳同胞共有２８０多万人，分别居住在７０多个国家和地区。
    赵紫阳非常关心侨乡教育事业的发展。他由广东省委书记林若陪同，来到刚创办三年的江门五邑大学。赵紫阳看到由“五邑”集资、侨胞捐助兴建的五邑大学里，一座座簇新漂亮的建筑物平地而起，非常高兴。他观看了学校总体规划模型，听取了校长关于建校情况的介绍，对学校工作提出了希望，要求师生员工不辜负五邑人民和海外乡亲的办学热忱，努力把这所大学办好，为侨乡培养出更多的人才，为发展教育事业做出贡献。
    正在举办迎春花市的开平县城三埠，江边路旁摆满了年桔和鲜花，洋溢着一派节日气氛。赵紫阳来到三埠，登上１７层的开平大厦，眺望了三江九桥、号称“小武汉”的三埠市容。然后，他驱车前往侨园美堂楼，参观了已故著名侨领司徒美堂纪念馆，瞻仰了司徒美堂铜像。赵紫阳对这位为新中国诞生做出贡献的爱国华侨领袖表示了敬意。
    台山县人口９５万，海外乡亲达１１０多万，被称作“第一侨乡”。赵紫阳由开平进入台山后，沿途参观了美籍华人陈荣畅投资兴办的大同开发有限公司柑桔场，侨眷陈坤璞利用海外乡亲资金创办的罗边工艺厂，以及中外合资的台山纺织厂等。在大同柑桔场，赵紫阳对陈荣畅先生说：“你投资办农场的方向很对。目前来投资办工业的已有很多，投资农业的还极少，开发农业也是非常需要的，你这个路子走得对！”离开柑桔场时，赵紫阳与陈荣畅紧紧握手，祝他全家春节快乐。
    赵紫阳在关注侨乡经济建设的同时，还非常关心侨乡的文化建设。他来到台山县政府所在地台城，参观了环境幽美、建筑别致的文化区。这里的图书馆、科技馆、博物馆、少年宫、电视大学、教育电视台等一系列教育文化设施，都是对外开放以来由旅居世界各地的台山乡亲捐资兴建的。赵紫阳在台城还听取了江门市委书记黎子流、台山县委书记黄抗健等的汇报，同大家讨论了侨乡建设问题。他说，侨乡的面貌变化很大，经济、文化都有很大发展，各项建设事业方兴未艾。这是坚决实行改革和对外开放，认真落实侨务政策，充分调动海外侨胞和归侨、侨眷积极性，发挥侨乡优势的结果。今后，要把侨乡建设得更好，必须继续坚持改革开放、落实华侨政策，进一步调动各方面的积极性。他还指出，在整顿经济秩序、治理经济环境期间，侨乡也要贯彻执行党和国家的方针政策。侨乡要分析自己的特点，发挥自己的优势，在整顿、治理中着重抓好经济结构的调整，下大功夫加强管理，提高效益。他希望各地侨乡都要坚持“两手抓”，既要大力发展社会主义商品经济，又要抓好思想领域的工作，包括认真加强党的建设，抓好精神文明建设等。他说，扎扎实实做好这些工作，在侨乡十分必要。坚持这样抓下去，侨乡的建设一定会越来越好。
