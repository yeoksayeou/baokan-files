The foreign ministers' meeting of five Central American countries concluded on February 9 in New York. The meeting reached an agreement on the military verification aspects of the Arias Peace Plan, but there are still disagreements on the political verification aspects.

The two-day meeting was attended by the foreign ministers of Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador, and Costa Rica, as well as the deputy foreign minister of Guatemala.

The eight foreign ministers and deputy foreign ministers who attended the meeting jointly wrote a letter to the United Nations Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar on February 8, requesting him to dispatch a military observation team to the region to verify the implementation of the Arias Peace Plan.

According to the communiqué issued on February 9, the foreign ministers and deputy foreign ministers had differing opinions on the steps to ensure democratization and respect for human rights and did not reach an agreement, which requires further discussion. The communiqué pointed out that, overall, the meeting was successful.
