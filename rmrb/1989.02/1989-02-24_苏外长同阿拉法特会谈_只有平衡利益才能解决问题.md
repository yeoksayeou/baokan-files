　　苏外长同阿拉法特会谈
    只有平衡利益才能解决问题
    新华社开罗２月２２日电  苏联外长谢瓦尔德纳泽同巴解组织执行主席阿拉法特２２日晚在苏联驻埃及使馆举行了３个小时的会谈。
    据消息灵通人士透露，双方讨论了筹备召开中东和平国际会议的步骤。双方同意，实现中东公正、全面和平的唯一办法是平衡冲突各方的利益。
    这位人士说，双方认为，必须使联合国安理会行动起来，以便使安理会５个常任理事国担负起召开中东和会的责任。双方还希望以色列能够改变对拟议中的中东和平国际会议的态度。
    会谈后，阿拉法特对新闻界说，巴解组织和苏联在举行中东和平国际会议的必要性方面持有一致的看法。
    阿拉法特是２２日抵达开罗的。
