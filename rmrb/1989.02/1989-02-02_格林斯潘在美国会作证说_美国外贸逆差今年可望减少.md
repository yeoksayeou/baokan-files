    Greenspan Testifies to U.S. Congress: U.S. Trade Deficit Expected to Decrease in 1989

    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, January 31st: Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said today in Congress that the U.S. trade deficit is expected to decrease in 1989, and this does not require a further depreciation of the dollar.

    Greenspan testified before the Joint Economic Committee of both houses of Congress, stating, "At the current exchange rate of the dollar, (U.S.) industry is quite competitive... U.S. export industries are also quite competitive. There is sufficient reason to believe that U.S. exports will be strong in 1989; it can also be expected that the trade deficit will decrease."

    He said that the United States will strengthen cooperation and coordination with other industrialized countries to make exchange rates more stable.

    He said that the United States must reduce the budget deficit. He believes that high interest rates are unlikely to lead to economic recession, and that tightening policies will only make the economy grow further rather than stagnate. He implied that adopting tightening policies to combat inflation is advisable.

    Western public opinion believes that Greenspan's remarks indicate that the Bush administration will not oppose using monetary tightening as a means to reduce the fiscal deficit.

　　格林斯潘在美国会作证说
    美国外贸逆差今年可望减少
    新华社华盛顿１月３１日电  美国联邦储备委员会主席格林斯潘今天在国会说，１９８９年，美国外贸逆差可望减少，但不必通过美元汇价进一步下跌来实现。
    格林斯潘在国会两院联合经济委员会作证时说，“在美元目前的汇价水平上，（美国的）工业是具有相当的竞争力的……美国的出口工业也是颇具竞争力的。有足够理由相信，１９８９年美国的出口将是强劲的；也可以预计，外贸逆差将趋于减少”。
    他说，美国将加强同其它工业国的合作和协调，目的是使货币汇率更加稳定。
    他说，美国必须使预算赤字减少。他认为，高利率不大可能导致经济衰退，紧缩政策只会使经济进一步增长，而不会使之停顿。他暗示，为对付通货膨胀，采取紧缩政策是可取的。
    西方舆论认为，格林斯潘的讲话表明，布什政府将不会反对以紧缩货币政策作为削减财政赤字的一种手段。
