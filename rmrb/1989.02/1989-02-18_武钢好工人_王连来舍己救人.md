Wugang First Steel Plant recently made a decision to confer the honorable title of "Good Worker Who Sacrifices Himself to Save Others" on Wang Lianlai, a worker from the Raw Materials Department, who gave his life to rescue another person.

On the morning of February 12 at 9:30, due to the noise from the machinery, Zhang Daohan, who was repairing a vehicle, did not notice a train approaching from the north end of the workshop. The train was only a few meters away from Zhang Daohan. Wang Lianlai pushed Zhang Daohan out of the way of the train. Zhang Daohan was saved, but Wang Lianlai lost his life.

　　武钢好工人
    王连来舍己救人
    据新华社武汉２月１７日电  （记者杨正文、詹仲德）武钢第一炼钢厂日前作出决定，授予为抢救他人而献出自己生命的原料车间工人王连来“舍己救人好工人”的光荣称号。
    ２月１２日上午９点半，由于机器的嘈杂声，使正在检修车辆的张道汉未发现从厂房北头开来的一列火车，火车离张道汉只有几米远了。王连来将张道汉推出铁轨外。张道汉得救了，王连来却献出了生命。
