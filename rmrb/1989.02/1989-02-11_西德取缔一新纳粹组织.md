West German Interior Minister Ziemer today announced in Bonn the dissolution of a neo-Nazi organization called the "National Assembly" (N.S.).

Ziemer said that the "National Assembly," established on July 15 last year, currently has 170 members. The organization has been conducting "anti-constitutional" activities in West Germany and is "particularly aggressive and belligerent." This organization also plans to participate in the state elections in Hesse this March. Its leader is Kühnen, who was previously the head of another neo-Nazi organization that was dissolved in 1983.

West German police today also raided a base of the "National Assembly" in Frankfurt. They found portraits of Hitler, some xenophobic slogans, and a large number of guns, daggers, and other weapons there.

　　西德取缔一新纳粹组织
    新华社波恩２月９日电  西德内政部长齐默尔曼今天在波恩宣布取缔一个名叫“国民大会”（Ｎ·Ｓ·）的新纳粹组织。
    齐默尔曼说，成立于去年７月１５日的“国民大会”现有１７０名成员。该组织在西德进行“敌视宪法”的活动。“特别具有侵略性和好斗性”。这个组织还打算参加今年３月黑森州地方选举。其领导人是屈南，他曾是１９８３年被取缔的另一个新纳粹组织的头目。
    西德警方今天还搜查了“国民大会”在法兰克福的一个据点。他们在这里发现了希特勒的挂像、一些排外的标语和大量的枪支、匕首等武器。
