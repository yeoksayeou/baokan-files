Khomeini Meets Shevardnadze

Khomeini Emphasizes Expanding Bilateral Relations to Counter the West

Soviet Foreign Minister Says Soviet-Iranian Relations Enter a New Phase

New China News Agency, Tehran, February 26

The 88-year-old Iranian religious leader Khomeini broke with tradition today, meeting with visiting Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze at his home in Jannatabad, north of Tehran. The two held a one-and-a-half-hour discussion, primarily on bilateral relations between Iran and the Soviet Union.

This was Khomeini's first meeting with a foreign guest in the past seven years. Tehran Radio broadcast the meeting live.

Khomeini welcomed the Soviet Union's completion of its full withdrawal from Afghanistan earlier this month.

He emphasized the importance of expanding Iran-Soviet relations in all fields to counter Western countries.

Shevardnadze presented a letter from Soviet leader Gorbachev to Khomeini. According to the radio broadcast, Gorbachev stated in the letter that the differences between Moscow and Tehran are insignificant. He called for Iran to develop relations with the Soviet Union on the basis of mutual respect.

The Soviet Foreign Minister said that the time has come for Soviet-Iranian relations to enter a new phase comprehensively.

Shevardnadze arrived here late on the 25th. Iran is the last stop on his five-nation Middle East tour. He is the highest-level Soviet official to visit Iran since 1979.

Observers here noted that the Soviet Foreign Minister's visit coincided with the deterioration of Iran's relations with Western countries over the publication of Rushdie's "The Satanic Verses" by a British publisher. Khomeini earlier this week declared that Iran does not need relations with Western countries.

　　霍梅尼会见谢瓦尔德纳泽
    霍梅尼强调扩大两国关系抗衡西方
    苏外长称苏伊关系将进入全新阶段
    新华社德黑兰２月２６日电  ８８岁的伊朗宗教领袖霍梅尼今天打破惯例，在德黑兰北郊贾马兰他的家里会见了来访的苏联外交部长谢瓦尔德纳泽，主要就伊苏双边关系问题同他进行了一个半小时的会谈。
    这是霍梅尼过去７年来第一次会见外国来宾。德黑兰电台实况转播了这次会晤。
    霍梅尼对苏联本月早些时候完成了从阿富汗的全部撤军表示欢迎。
    他强调了在各个领域扩大伊苏两国关系以抗衡西方国家的重要性。
    谢瓦尔德纳泽递交了苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫给霍梅尼的一封信。据电台广播说，戈尔巴乔夫在信中指出，莫斯科同德黑兰之间的分歧无关紧要。他呼吁伊朗在相互尊重的基础上发展同苏联的关系。
    苏联外长说，苏伊关系全面进入一个新阶段的时间业已到来。
    谢瓦尔德纳泽是２５日晚抵达这里的。伊朗是他此次中东５国之行的最后一站。他是１９７９年以来访问伊朗的苏联最高级官员。
    此间观察家注意到，苏联外长的来访正好发生在围绕英国出版拉什迪的《撒旦诗篇》一书而引起了伊朗同西方国家关系全面恶化之时。霍梅尼本周早些时候声称，伊朗不需要同西方国家的关系。（附图片）
