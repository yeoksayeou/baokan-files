European Community countries have agreed to recall their ambassadors from Iran to protest against Iran's order to execute Salman Rushdie.

	The Associated Press reported from London at 2 a.m. on February 21 that European Community countries have agreed to recall their ambassadors from Iran to protest against Iran's order to execute Salman Rushdie.

	Today's afternoon meeting of the European Community's foreign ministers in Brussels agreed to freeze high-level mutual visits between Iran and European Community countries.

	However, they rejected a proposal to restrict the activities of Iranian diplomats in European Community countries.

	The meeting of European Community foreign ministers was held after Ayatollah Khomeini's statement that he would never forgive Rushdie.

	It is reported that the Archbishop of Canterbury also issued a statement condemning Ayatollah Khomeini's order to execute Rushdie. He also called on Islamic leaders in Britain to keep their anger within the bounds of the law. British Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe announced after the European Community foreign ministers' meeting that Britain would immediately withdraw all its diplomatic personnel from Iran. He said that Ayatollah Khomeini's threat to Rushdie's life violated international norms of conduct and was unacceptable.

　　抗议霍梅尼指令处死英作家
    欧共体各国将召回驻伊大使
    本报伦敦２月２１日凌晨２时电  记者陈特安报道：欧洲共同体国家已经同意召回它们驻伊朗的大使，以抗议伊朗判处拉什迪死刑的指令。
    今天下午在布鲁塞尔举行的欧洲共同体外长会议上，外长们同意冻结伊朗与欧洲共同体国家间的高级互访。
    然而，他们拒绝一项关于限制伊朗外交官在欧洲共同体国家内活动的建议。
    欧共体外长间的会晤是在阿亚图拉·霍梅尼永远不原谅拉什迪的声明发表后举行的。
    据报道，英国坎特伯雷大主教也发表声明，谴责阿亚图拉判处拉什迪死刑的指令。他并呼吁在英国的伊斯兰领袖们把愤怒约束在法律允许的范围之内。英国外交大臣杰弗里·豪在欧洲共同体外长会议后宣布，英国将立即从伊朗撤回它所有外交人员。他说，阿亚图拉发出的对拉什迪的生命的威胁，违犯了国际行为准则，是不能容忍的。
