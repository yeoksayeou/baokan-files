As an important part of the Olympic strategy, the question of which projects should be included in the National Games has been raised within the State Sports Commission and has attracted the attention of various national sports teams. For example, there is a need to confirm the priority development of advantageous projects or projects that can enter the Olympics in the short term.

However, it is understood that there are still disagreements on the confirmation of some specific projects. For instance, there is controversy over whether to cancel the chess events in the National Games. Some officials and experts in the chess community believe that due to the objective existence of the tendency to focus on the "National Games strategy" to varying degrees, canceling the chess events in the National Games will definitely affect the enthusiasm of local teams, thereby impacting the cultivation of reserve forces. The development history of Chinese chess also illustrates this point, so it is necessary to consider this carefully. It is understood that in terms of the game of Go, the Chinese team alone earned nearly 160,000 yuan in net income for the country in various international competitions last year, making it one of the most profitable teams among all national teams. Moreover, major international tournaments such as the Fujitsu Cup and the Appleseed Cup were held last year, indicating that the traditional Chinese game of Go has entered its international year. In this context, it seems inappropriate to cancel its inclusion in the National Games.

Some in the chess community also say: Chess has a significant international influence. In 1988, the South News Agency selected the world's top ten news figures of the year, including Soviet international chess grandmasters Kasparov and Karpov, along with world-renowned politicians such as Deng Xiaoping and Reagan. The influence of chess competitions is evident. Furthermore, the International Chess Federation is currently seeking to include international chess in the Olympics, which seems to be a relevant issue.

From another perspective, chess is simple and convenient, with an extremely broad mass foundation. However, having a mass foundation is not enough; to ensure its professional level, it is necessary for local authorities to genuinely value the sport, which will then be able to guarantee the cultivation of reserve forces. Chinese women's international chess has reached an advanced world level, and the achievements and influence of Chinese Go are also evident. These results have not been easily achieved.

It is particularly noteworthy that Go and Chinese chess are excellent cultural heritage of the Chinese nation. Since we want to promote them to the world, their homeland should bear the main responsibility. The National Games should indeed consider issues from the perspective of world sports culture, but the proposal to cancel projects with the most extensive national foundation is worth careful consideration.

　　从奥运战略和群众基础出发
    ——关于取消全运会棋类比赛的争议
    作为奥运战略的重要内容，全运会应设置哪些项目的问题已在国家体委内提出，并引起国家各运动队的关注。诸如确认优先发展优势项目或短期能进入奥运会的项目等等。
    不过据了解，在某些具体项目确认上还存在分歧。比如是否取消全运会棋类比赛项目就有争议。棋类运动负责人和专家中有人认为，由于地方以“全运会战略”为中心的倾向客观上在不同程度上的存在，取消全运会棋类比赛，肯定会影响地方办队的积极性，从而影响后备力量的培养。中国棋类运动发展历史也说明这点，因此需要从长计议。据了解，就围棋运动而言，中国队仅去年一年在各种国际比赛中为国家赢得近１６万元的净收入，是国家各运动队中效益最好的之一。何况去年富士通、应氏杯等世界大赛相继举办，说明中国优秀的文化遗产围棋运动已经迎来了它的国际元年。在这种形势下，取消其在全运会中的项目设置似乎不妥当。
    棋界还有人说：棋类运动在国际上影响极大，１９８８年南通社评出世界当年十大新闻人物，苏联国际象棋大师卡斯帕罗夫、卡尔波夫与邓小平、里根等世界著名政治家同上一榜，棋类比赛的影响力可见一斑。再说国际象棋联合会现在正在争取把国际象棋打入奥运会，此下彼上，似乎是个问题。
    从另一方面看，棋类运动简便易行，有着极其广泛的群众基础。但光有群众基础是不行的，要保证其专业水平，则必须使地方重视该运动的切实感，方有可能保证后备力量的培养落在实处。中国女子国际象棋已达到世界先进水平，中国围棋运动的成绩和影响也是有目共睹的，其成果来之不易。
    尤其值得注意的是，围棋以及中国象棋是中华民族文化的优秀遗产，既然想使之走向世界，其故乡理应承担起主要的责任。全运会固然应该从世界体育文化的角度考虑问题，但取消具有最广泛的国民基础的项目的提议是值得斟酌的。
