To address issues of poor quality and shortages, the Soviet Union publishes a draft law on protecting consumer rights

	Newspaper Xinhua, Moscow, February 11 - (Reporter Shen Faliang) On February 8, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR decided to publish the draft law on the quality of Soviet products and the protection of consumer rights in the press for public discussion. The full text of this draft law was published in this evening's edition of Izvestia.

	The quality of many Soviet products is poor, and consumers have long been dissatisfied. However, enterprises focus only on output and profits, paying little attention to customer feedback. Recently, the issues of poor product quality, shortages, and long queues have become hot topics in the press. People have long been awaiting the enactment of such a law.

	The draft law stipulates that the standards for product quality should be determined by consumers, producers, and state agencies, with consumers being given the primary role and ensuring their participation in the formulation of product quality standards. The state should use economic management methods to encourage the production of high-quality products, creating favorable conditions for improving product quality. Enterprises and individuals selling substandard products should be held legally responsible.

	The draft law requires the implementation of a system where high-quality products are priced higher and low-quality products are priced lower. Enterprises producing high-quality products should be given preferential treatment, while those producing substandard products should face a series of penalties, up to and including reorganization or dissolution.

	To protect consumer rights, the draft law stipulates that substandard goods should be replaced or discounted. Any losses incurred by consumers and their property due to the purchase of substandard goods should be compensated by the selling and producing units. Consumers can also resolve disputes with selling and producing units through the courts. Soviet citizens have the right to voluntarily establish consumer associations to protect their rights.

    苏联公布维护消费者权利法草案
    新华社莫斯科２月１１日电  （记者沈法良）苏联最高苏维埃主席团２月８日决定在报刊上公布苏联产品质量和维护消费者权利法草案，以供全民讨论。《消息报》今晚刊登了这项法律草案的全文。
    苏联不少产品质量低劣，消费者对此早有怨言，但企业只顾追求产值和利润，很少考虑顾客的意见。近来，产品质量差、缺货和顾客排长队这３个问题已成为报上的热门话题。人们早就期待着有这样一项法律问世了。
    法律草案规定，对产品质量的要求，应由消费者、生产者和国家机关来定，消费者不仅处于第一位，而且还确保消费者参与产品质量标准的制订工作。国家则应适用经济的管理方式，刺激生产优质产品，为提高产品质量创造有利条件，凡销售不合格产品的企业和公民，均应承担法律责任。
    法律草案要求对各种商品实行优质优价和劣质低价；给生产优质产品的企业以优惠，对生产劣质产品的单位则规定了一系列惩罚措施，直至进行改组或予以撤销。
    为了保障消费者的权益，法律草案规定不合格的商品应予更换或削价，消费者个人和财产因购买劣质商品而蒙受的全部损失，销售单位和生产单位应予赔偿。消费者还可通过法院解决同销售和生产单位之间的纠纷。苏联公民有权自愿成立消费者协会，以维护自己的权益。
