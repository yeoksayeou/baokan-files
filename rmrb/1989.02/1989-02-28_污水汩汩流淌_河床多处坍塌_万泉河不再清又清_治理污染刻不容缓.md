Polluted water flows, riverbeds collapse
The once-clear Wenchang River needs urgent pollution control

HAIKOU, Feb. 27 (Xinhua) -- The Wenchang River, once famous for its clear waters, is now facing severe industrial pollution and ecological damage.

According to survey data, the Wenchang River receives the following pollutants annually: approximately 270 million tons of wastewater, 684 tons of suspended solids, 3,570 tons of chemical oxygen demand, and 6.9 tons of oil. Additionally, significant amounts of heavy metals are discharged into the river. Meanwhile, some river sections have been privately leased for sand mining, with extraction occurring within 100 meters of the riverbank, contrary to regulations. In some areas, sand mining has lowered the riverbed by over 10 meters, causing substantial water seepage. Riverbank protective forests have collapsed in multiple locations, leading to soil erosion.

For Hainan Province, the Wenchang River is the largest and most important water source for the Sanya Economic Zone and the Qinglan Economic Zone. Therefore, it is urgent to take timely measures during the initial stages of economic development to protect water resources and the ecological environment.

　　污水汩汩流淌　河床多处坍塌
    万泉河不再清又清  治理污染刻不容缓
    本报海口二月二十七日电  记者罗自苏报道：“万泉河水清又清”，往日以清澈美丽闻名的海南岛万泉河，近几年正遭受工业污染的威胁，以及对其自然景观的破坏。
    据普查资料记载，万泉河纳污情况如下：废水每年约二百七十多万吨，悬浮物每年约六百八十四吨；化学耗氧量每年约三千五百七十多吨，油类每年约六点九吨多；还有不少金属排入。与此同时，万泉河一些河段沙场被私人承包，挖沙取沙无人过问。原来规定只能在河岸一百米以外取沙，现在一些河段一百米以内也在取，有些地段的沙场已低于河床，最深处达十多米，河水大量内渗。有的河岸护林带多处坍塌，出现水土流失。
    对海南省来讲，万泉河水系是通什经济区和清澜经济区中最大、最重要的水源。因此在经济开发的初期及时采取对策，以保护水资源和生态环境已刻不容缓。
