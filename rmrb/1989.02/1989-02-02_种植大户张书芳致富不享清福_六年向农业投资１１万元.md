The wealthy farmer Zhang Shufang from Hengshui City in Hebei Province does not enjoy his wealth in leisure. Instead, he continuously increases his investment in agriculture. Since 1983, when he began leasing land, he has invested a total of 110,000 yuan in agriculture.

Zhang Shufang is from Lijia Village in Banchaodian Township. In 1983, he leased 100 mu of farmland that had been losing money for years. Later, he leased additional land from his village and neighboring villages, totaling over 540 mu. Zhang Shufang, who has a background in farming, understands that good crops require significant investment. He is willing to spend money on agriculture. Over the years, he has spent over 26,000 yuan to purchase various tractors and other machinery, achieving partial mechanization of agriculture. He has spent over 56,000 yuan on fertilizers and pesticides, applying an average of 40 tons of fertilizer and 100 kilograms of pesticides to the fields each year. He has also invested over 10,000 yuan to purchase over 10,000 kilograms of high-quality seeds. Additionally, he has used part of his funds to repair wells, build anti-seepage ditches, and implement plastic mulching. Over the years, he has sold 35 tons of grain and 150 tons of cotton to the state.

Even after becoming wealthy, Zhang Shufang continues to work tirelessly, often in wind and rain. However, his house, which was built nearly 10 years ago, still lacks a completed courtyard wall and gatehouse.

　　种植大户张书芳致富不享清福
    六年向农业投资１１万元
    本报讯  河北省衡水市种植大户张书芳，致富之后不图安逸享清福，不断增加对农业的投入，从１９８３年承包土地以来，先后为农业投资达１１万元。
    张书芳是班曹店乡李家村人。１９８３年，他承包了本乡连年亏损的１００亩农场地，之后又陆续承包了本村和邻村农民转包的土地共计５４０多亩。种地出身的张书芳，深知庄稼长得好，投入不可少的道理，舍得在农业上花本钱。几年来，他花２．６万多元购置了大小拖拉机等机器设备，初步实现了农业机械化；拿出５．６万多元购买化肥、农药，每年平均往大田里投肥４０吨，喷洒农药１００公斤；投资１万多元购买了１万多公斤良种；他还拿出部分资金用于修缮机井、建设防渗垄沟、搞地膜覆盖。几年来，他共向国家交售粮食３５吨，棉花１５０吨。
    张书芳致富之后，还是整天风里雨里地干，可他家里房子盖了都快１０年了，院墙和门楼至今还没垒起来。
