Title: New People of the Ruins — Chronicle of Zhang Zhenmin's School Establishment

Edition: 5

The Book of Songs says: "King Wen received the mandate, with this martial prowess, having conquered at Chong, established a town at Feng... The diviner considered King Wen, residing in this capital of Hao." This land by the Zhen and Hao rivers once had such a glorious past. The soil layers here are unusually thick, just like the history here, if you dig randomly on the ground, "clang!" suddenly, unexpectedly, you might find Qin bricks and Han tiles. The stones used by farmers to build walls, the troughs for feeding pigs, the old well covers, if you're not careful, you might find stone tablets, bronze tripods, iron shields, and whatnot. And then there are the chariot and horse pits, a chariot with four horses, bronze chariot shafts, and horse heads, making foreigners with blond hair and blue eyes shout in amazement. Undoubtedly, this is a land rich in cultural atmosphere. The natives of this land are mostly large-handed and broad-shouldered, with full foreheads, prominent brow ridges, wide noses almost touching their mouths, long waists, and short legs, just like a group of reincarnated Terracotta Warriors of Qin Shihuang. At the same time, the stubborn remnants of feudalism haunt their minds, making people both honest and cunning, dignified and narrow-minded, cultured and polite yet aggressive. They are unwilling to give even a single hair for the benefit of others, believing that if they don't gain anything, they have suffered a great loss. Neighbors can be as friendly as can be when their interests align, but if one accidentally receives an extra egg, they will sulk for days. On such land, in such an atmosphere, if a native farmer wants to choose a new way of life, what will the situation be like?

One

Zhang Zhenmin is a thoroughbred farmer from the ruins of Zhen and Hao, a man who has had his share of bad luck. During the Cultural Revolution, people were judged by their class background, and he was unlucky. He hadn't even warmed the bench in middle school before he was kicked out. But he didn't wilt! At 15, still a carefree youth, he went to the Qinling Mountains to build a reservoir. Every day, he pulled an 800-pound stone cart, running wildly on the mountain roads. To support his grandmother, mother, and three brothers, and to compete for the mobile red flag and the title of "Five Good Water Conservancy Warrior." When eating, he sucked the corn porridge loudly. But as he ate, he got so tired that he fell asleep. The bowl fell to the ground and shattered.

He was born with a handsome face and a refined appearance, completely unlike the robust and strong men of Guanzhong. The county drama troupe recruited actors, and he was spotted immediately. They asked him to sing, and he raised his head, opening his mouth with a perfect rendition of "Fighting the Tiger Up the Mountain" by Yang Zirong. However, in those days, he was only fit to be a farmer pulling stones, not worthy of being a "Five Good" or performing on stage as a hero, which made him disheartened.

His temperament is choleric. He loves to show off and climbs the ladder as soon as he sees it. He is bold and stubborn. His middle school homeroom teacher, Li Suzhen, once evaluated him, saying, "Zhang Zhenmin, this student, if he walks the right path, will be excellent; if he walks the wrong path, he will be very bad." He always remembered his teacher's words, and he could taste the praise in them. He imagined that one day he would become a "person of note" or achieve something, and he would definitely go to see his teacher. To do what? To verify the teacher's prophecy? To repay the teacher's recognition? He didn't think too much about it, he would think about it later! For now, he strongly felt that he couldn't live like before! If he continued like this, he would never have such a day in his life. He was afraid that one day he would become indistinguishable from the people around him, afraid that even a falling leaf would hit his head... Really, what's the point of living to this level? What's the point of this life?

Two

In 1984, China's rural reforms entered their fifth year. Zhang Zhenmin was still a farmer, but no longer in the old sense. That year in April, the contract for the materials factory he managed in Huayuan Village expired. After calculating, wow, a profit of 70,000 yuan in one year!

A few days later, one evening, the four Zhang brothers were eating dinner, chewing on their own pickled radishes, and discussing the ancient tomb that had been dug up in a neighboring village a few days ago. To be precise, it was a pit full of copper coins, or more precisely, a pit full of copper rust. In the vast tomb, except for a set of white bones, it was all copper coins, with rust marks scattered everywhere. From above, it looked like a pool of green water, emitting a faint copper smell. The Cultural Relics Bureau sent a large truck, and it took two days to load everything.

Who was the tomb owner? A marquis? A minister? A royal relative? The brothers guessed. "It's a miser!" Zhang Zhenmin blurted out.

The contract was fulfilled, and 70,000 yuan was in hand. Zhang Zhenmin announced, "I will invest 60,000 yuan to establish a Huayuan Primary School."

Indeed, the primary school by the village was in such bad shape. Four classrooms were leaning to one side, and during rainy days, passersby didn't dare to stop to avoid the rain. Several part-time teachers had become businessmen, selling eggs, bran, peaches, and plums. It was hard to find a day in a month when they were all in the classroom. They took turns covering for each other, and the price for teaching a class was clearly marked at 30 cents.

This school tormented the students and chilled the parents' hearts, hoping their children would succeed. From primary to secondary school, the number of students who passed was scarce, and some students' test papers had their names written incorrectly.

Not to mention producing university students in groups like a few years ago. Illiteracy was surging in waves. Here, a brilliant bronze culture was once nurtured, and the first work in Chinese literary history, the Book of Songs, was produced. Even today's lunar calendar originated here and spread throughout the country. But on this fertile land of talented people, the footprints of cultural dwarfs were imprinted.

Whose fault was it? Everyone blamed society for mistreating them, and everyone was in a hurry to make money. Those who could make money were insatiable, fearing they would never have enough; those who couldn't make money were resentful, cursing prices, wages, and corrupt officials. How many people truly cared about education and dedicated their hearts and souls to it? Just as the school construction was progressing smoothly, there was someone who pulled Zhang Zhenmin aside: "Brother, 60,000 yuan, my goodness, it's terrifying, let me count it, it might take days! Reduce the donation by 10,000, give it to me! You made the money easily, I'll remember your kindness for a lifetime." Saying this, he was about to kneel down. Zhang Zhenmin pulled him up and said nothing. Why bother saying anything? In the eyes of some people, money is the holy object they strive for their entire lives. With money, they have the bricks, tiles, and wood for building houses, the dowry and banquet for their children's weddings, and the funeral music and decent coffin for burying their elders. But Zhang Zhenmin ran a materials factory, not a mint, was the 60,000 yuan easy to come by? In 1980, he ran around, finally establishing the materials factory, but the village cadres didn't trust him, only letting him be the deputy director and procurement officer. Looking at the books, in 1981, the profit was 5,000 yuan, but who knew he had 5,000 yuan worth of receipts in his pocket that he didn't report. Why? The villagers saw the factory making no profit all year round, it was strange if it didn't close down! Farmers, they wait under the chicken's butt for eggs every day! If it doesn't lay eggs, what's the use of the chicken? Later, with the contract responsibility system, he worked from morning to night, like a machine running at full speed. For a month or two, he never took off his clothes to sleep, the cracks on his lips oozed blood all the time. And those various unclear inspections made him speechless, who could afford to offend? If you're not sensible, you'll eat it and carry it home! That autumn, his mother was sick in bed, missing her son, saying that seeing Zhang Zhenmin would give her spirit, but the factory was at a critical moment, he couldn't leave, and his mother died without seeing her son one last time. On the day of the burial, the Market Three Construction Company came to inspect the floor quality, he wore mourning clothes, pretending to be happy, laughing as he introduced the products, and then ran to his mother's grave, crying so loudly that the mountains shook... Every yuan of that 60,000 was soaked in his sweat and tears!

Preparation in June, groundbreaking in July, completion in August. In early August, when the school opened, the Huayuan Primary School that appeared before everyone became a real garden. 11 two-story earthquake-resistant classrooms, 21 reinforced concrete single-story buildings hidden among the flowers and trees. On the day of the ceremony, leaders from the provincial, municipal, and county levels rushed to congratulate, and the sound of drums and firecrackers made this land, which once stood the capital of Western Zhou, tremble with excitement.

Three

In China's population, farmers make up the majority, but how many have small farmer consciousness and small farmer psychology? It's probably frighteningly high. Don't believe it, go find in some leadership offices in tall buildings, in various running cars, they may wear suits and ties, gold-rimmed glasses, and modern hairstyles. Some people, after losing the diligence and simplicity of farmers, only combine the bad qualities of farmers with the power they control, and corruption is inevitable.

A certain official in the district committee is such a farmer with power. He is thin, wearing a faded size three military uniform all year round. In his subconscious, within a 30-mile radius, it seems that everything is a fiefdom given to him by the Communist Party, it's just that now it's not fashionable to wear dragon robes and purple sashes. During the days from the groundbreaking of Huayuan Primary School to the ceremony, he went home to build his own house. That house, costing 250,000 yuan, was built with great ambition and elegance! With his monthly salary, he might not even be able to buy all the curtains! After that, he never stepped into the Huayuan Primary School, which was just a stone's throw away from the district committee. Why did this Zhang Zhenmin fellow make such a fuss? He just couldn't figure it out, his head hurt so much! Finally, he understood, reputation is a fixed quantity, Zhang Zhenmin has more, so he has less! You, Zhang Zhenmin, prove what by establishing a school? Prove that I don't value education? Good boy, you're trying to make yourself look good, and you're actually blackening my face. Let's see who's right!

Investigations of Zhang Zhenmin were sent out in batches. The accounts were combed through again and again like combing hair. Various so-called complaint letters flew like snowflakes to the desks of leaders at all levels. To improve efficiency, they rented a Crown car to run around.

Then, rumors spread that he was selling steel, notices were issued to report his destruction of cultural relics, and leaflets listing his ten crimes were released. Even the certificate naming him as a New Long March Pioneer by the Communist Youth League was withheld. Someone boasted that he might be arrested, and someone was even more anxious, saying he had already been imprisoned.

It must be admitted that the opponent was formidable. The crimes listed, except for the last one, if any of them were proven, would be enough for him to face serious consequences. The last one was a bit out of place: "Zhang Zhenmin is a farmer, but he doesn't farm, doesn't raise chickens, doesn't raise pigs, how does he get rich?" Poor small farmer mentality!

Several brothers finally couldn't bear it anymore. They cried, shouted, wanted to smash the stone monument in the schoolyard, tear up the banners, and trample the awards under their feet, crying out in despair: "What kind of world is this! Good deeds go unrewarded!"

Zhang Zhenmin is also a human being, and during those days, he often sat on his mother's grave all night, listening to the surging waves of the Zhen River, his heart filled with sorrow. Rumors have such a great advantage, ignore them, and people will think you admit it; argue with them, and you will be trapped in endless refutations, unable to do anything else. He didn't know that investing in education had harmed anyone, was doing good so difficult? He also didn't understand why the leaders didn't step forward to say a fair word. At the beginning, they had spoken to Zhang Zhenmin with words as sweet as flowers! Zhang Zhenmin, you still don't understand the habits of some people in China, they are more interested in accusing someone than in praising someone, they look at praise materials with squinting eyes, and when looking at exposure materials, their eyes are wide open. They need stimulation to entertain their already numb or half-numb souls.

He went to the media, believing in the character and power of public opinion. In this regard, Zhang Zhenmin once again distanced himself from traditional small farmer consciousness. Let's excerpt some newspaper headlines:

December 27, 1984, People's Daily: "Farmer Zhang Zhenmin Invests 60,000 Yuan to Establish a Primary School for His Hometown"
May 1, 1985, Xi'an Evening News: "Specialized Household Recommends Self as Village Head, One Rich Brings Prosperity to the Whole Village"
May 2, 1985, Xinhua News Agency: "Telegram: I Accompany the Spring Wind to Warm the Garden — Recording Young Farmer Zhang Zhenmin"
May 3, 1985, Shaanxi Daily: "Zhang Zhenmin Becomes Village Head in Four Months, Establishes Four Factories"
May 18, 1985, China Township Enterprise News: "Broad Mind — Recording Farmer Entrepreneur and National New Long March Pioneer Zhang Zhenmin"
May 21, 1985, China Youth Daily: "With Ten Million Yuan, Not Forgetting to Help the Poor, Young Village Head Zhang Zhenmin Helps the Poor Find the Path to Riches"
October 2, 1985, Economic Reference News: "Rumors and Slander Defame Advanced Individuals — Vice Governor Inspects on the Spot to Distinguish Right from Wrong"
And that official also exposed himself in Legal Weekly and Xi'an Evening News. He also had serious problems of torture, forging credentials, obtaining diplomas, and buying and selling cars!

Four

Zhang Zhenmin's home is only one wall away from Huayuan Primary School. Lying in bed, he can clearly hear the teachers' lectures and the students' reading. Listening to these sounds, he feels it is a kind of enjoyment, a kind of comfort. Like the patter of spring rain at night, like the dripping of a mountain spring, it is wonderful, it is pleasant, at this moment, his heart is like honey melting, and all troubles disappear.

Zhang Zhenmin is a money tree, but not everyone can shake money out of it. He only invests in education, giving generously and freely. On the school construction investment agreement, it said 60,000 yuan, but when the school was completed, he had already paid 76,000 yuan. For this, he did not hesitate to sell his car and the equipment of the enterprise. Later, the uniforms for teachers and students, the allowances for teachers, bonuses, additional books, desks, and teaching aids were all paid for by him. When funds were tight, he would rather delay the payment of workers' wages than let the school be in trouble. When it got cold, he gave money to teachers to buy electric blankets; when it got hot, he gave money to teachers to buy electric fans; seeing that the teachers' meals were not good, he gave a fixed meal allowance; when teachers left for further studies, he covered all the living expenses... From 1985 to now, another 50,000 yuan, who knows about all this?

Zhang Zhenmin seems to be silently competing with someone? Maybe. But is there such a way to compete? Unbelievable. The school discusses work, he comes uninvited and doesn't leave until it's over. When recruiting or hiring new teachers, he is the hardest to pass. Those who teach with insincerity, those with bad character, those who are not good at their jobs, no matter who speaks for them, it's no use; but once he likes someone, he will meet any request. There is a student named Xiao Zhang Hong in the fourth grade who always comes late and doesn't do homework. One day, Zhang Zhenmin met him outside the school. Asking, he found out that the child's parents had divorced, and the child had no food to eat. He wiped the child's tears and wiped his nose, took him to the class teacher, the principal, and finally to the kitchen staff, instructing: "Let the child eat in the kitchen, you will be troubled, charge it to my account!" He also took out five yuan, took the child to buy a pen. After a few days, he would check the child's homework once. This, again, is competing with whom?

"Quality, everything depends on people's quality!" Zhang Zhenmin said, "The previous generation has been fixed, even gods can't change it. If education doesn't improve, the next generation will be shortsighted, unable to distinguish right from wrong, and people will harm people, generation after generation like this, what should we do!"

Maybe Zhang Zhenmin's goal is too ethereal, almost like a dream. China is too big, and the population is too large, can you establish all the schools and manage all the students? Can establishing a good Huayuan Primary School change the quality of future Chinese citizens? But who can blame him, ridicule him, or pour cold water on him? Indeed, a primary school cannot change a generation, cannot improve a generation, but his sincere feelings and sincere heart may make those who dream of making money, promoting officials, eating and drinking, using power for personal gain, and scheming all day, or those who sleep all day and don't dream at all, feel a little ashamed! The country is a vast sky, and people are stars. Tonight, the stars are shining brightly, doesn't that foretell the fiery red sun of tomorrow?

With a "honorary principal" like Zhang Zhenmin, how can Huayuan Primary School not soar? No wonder teachers from the entire township, district, and even the entire county yearn for this school! They either ask others to introduce them or recommend themselves, requesting to work at Huayuan Primary School. The 20 teachers in the school all participate in correspondence and television university studies, everyone is afraid of being eliminated, afraid of being transferred. Parents within a radius of several dozen miles compete to come to Huayuan Village to visit relatives and friends, letting their children study at Huayuan Primary School. In four years of running the school, in the examinations of dozens of schools in the entire township and district, Huayuan Primary School has consecutively won first place, and the awards from the city, county, district, and township have been brought back 32 times.

Five

"Running a business for education!" In recent years, Zhang Zhenmin's several factories have become more and more prosperous. To establish a chemical factory, he carried dry food, traveling all over the universities in the Xi'an area. The products came out, and he needed to pass the appraisal and collect users, in half a year, he ran to the mining areas in the Qinling Mountains more than 60 times. During that time, he often had headaches, and he swallowed more than 200 packs of painkillers. He said the pills were good, bitter with a taste, with a beginning and an end... He didn't consider it bitter, he always said he made money comfortably. No matter what time, his clothes were always clean, his demeanor was calm, and his speech was elegant. "Compared to Wu Yunchu, I didn't become a donkey to push the mill, nor did I beg on the streets, punch for five cents, kick for ten cents," he laughed, "but I made more money than Old Wu, made money in a civilized way, you say?"

Yes, yes. With this realization, Zhang Zhenmin did not miss any opportunity to make money, he subscribed to almost all newspapers of the type of economic information, commodity advertisements, and he traveled to many cities in China. For some reason, he always liked to deal with universities, big or small matters, he always wanted professors to help him make decisions. Lanzhou University, Shaanxi Normal University, Xi'an Highway Institute, Xi'an Medical University, Xi'an Petroleum University, Northwest University of Political Science and Law have all established cooperative relationships with him, and his technical consultants are spread across various majors in universities. He has decided to take the path of scientific and technological wealth, not hesitating to spend money to buy patents, his courage and ambition are unimaginable to traditional farmers. In operation, he adheres to credit, ensures quality, delivers on time, and provides thoughtful service. Now, he has signed all the five-year supply contracts for his products awarded the second-class science and technology prize in Shaanxi Province — high-grade lubricating oil. He longs to become a rich man as soon as possible, so that he has more power when promoting education.

On April 27, 1988, Zhang Zhenmin solemnly proposed to the Dumen Township Party Committee and the Dumen Township People's Government to donate all the income from the construction, prefabricated concrete, casting, and chemical enterprises he managed in recent years, to build a Dumen Junior High School, with an estimated amount of 300,000 yuan.

Two years ago in September, Zhang Zhenmin came to the campus of Shaanxi Normal University, where osmanthus flowers were fragrant, to begin a two-year study. He didn't want a diploma, he just wanted to improve himself as soon as possible. How can one run a school without understanding education? Moreover, he had a simple and beautiful wish — to become a qualified middle school teacher. Every morning, he sat among the university students, listening to the lectures attentively. He listened to Chinese literature, economics, psychology, and education. He studied very hard, very diligently, no one forced him, but he always felt like there was a whip hanging behind him. After a year, he took five notebooks of notes.

The teacher asked him about his future plans, and he smiled shyly. Those deep eyes revealed a kind of profound, stern, and mature concern. "Like the primary school, the middle school should also be run to a first-class level. If possible, next year I want to go abroad at my own expense to see the education abroad. By the age of forty, I want to see if I can establish a university."

This is Zhang Zhenmin.

He stands on the ruins of Zhen and Hao.

May the people on this land not find their glory in ancient tombs, nor stand on the ruins to reminisce about yesterday's splendor. The only thing worth being proud of is today's creation, just like Zhang Zhenmin!

    ——全国新长征突击手张政民办学纪事
    刘路　功振
    《诗经》有云：“文王受命，有此武功，既伐于崇，作邑于丰……考卜维王，宅是镐京。”这沣滈之滨，曾经有过一个多么辉煌的往昔。这里的土层出奇地深厚，和这里的历史一样，随便在地上刨挖，“咣当”一声，猛不防就有秦砖汉瓦蹦出来。农家砌墙的石条，喂猪的食盆，多年的井盖，弄不好就是石碑、铜鼎、铁盾什么的。还有那车马坑遗址，一架车套着４匹马，铜铸车辕、具镶马头，看得金发碧眼的洋人夸张地嗷嗷直叫。无疑，这是一片氤氲着浓厚文化气息的土地。在这块土地上出生的乡民，大都手脚粗大，前额饱满，眉骨隆起，鼻阔近于嘴，腰长过于腿，活脱脱的一群秦始皇兵马俑的复出。同时，顽固的封建亡灵又像梦魇一样纠缠着他们的头脑，使得人们忠厚而又狡黠，雍容而又狭隘，文质彬彬而又气势汹汹。他们不愿多拔一毛而利他人，认定没有沾光便是吃了大亏；邻居间在利害一致的时候，可以相好得俗不堪言，一旦错收了一颗鸡蛋，就会绷着脸别扭多日。在这样的土地上，在这样的气氛中，一个土生土长的农民，如果想要重新选择一种做人方式，他将会是怎样的情景？
    　　　　一
    张政民是沣镐遗址上一个彻头彻尾的农民，一个曾经背时过的家伙。文化大革命中，按出身判定人种的优劣，他活该倒霉。中学的板凳没有坐热，就被扫地出门了。但没有蔫！１５岁，还是少年不知愁滋味的年龄，他进终南山修水库去了。每天拉着８００斤重的运石车，在山路上拚命的飞跑。为养活祖母、母亲和３个兄弟，更为争那面流动红旗和“五好”水利战士的称号。吃饭的时候，他把玉米粥吮得吱吱作响。但吃着吃着，竟累得睡着了。碗掉在地上，打了个粉碎。
    他生得眉清目秀，一表人材，全没有关中汉子的威武粗壮。县剧团招演员，一眼就看中了他。让他试唱，他头一扬，一开口就是一个地道的打虎上山的杨子荣。然而，那年头，他只配当拉石头的农民，没资格当“五好”，也没上台演英雄的份儿，这未免使他丧气。
    他的气质属于胆汁质。好大喜功，见到梯子便上墙。胆贼大，性特犟。中学班主任李素珍曾这样评价说，张政民这个学生，日后要走到正路上，就会好得没法说；要走上斜路，那也会坏得不得了。他总记着这位老师的话，他能品出这中间赞许的味道。他想象着有一天他成了“人物”或成就了一番事业，他一定要去看望这位老师。去干什么？印证老师的预言吗？报答老师的知遇吗？他没有往下细想，到时候再想吧！现时，他只强烈地感到，像原先那样的日子不能再过下去了！再过下去，人生的日历上就永远别想有这么一天。他怕有一天自己会变得与周围的乡党们毫无二致，树叶落下也怕会砸着脑袋……真的，人活到这个水平，这辈子还有什么意思呢？
    　　　　二
    １９８４年，中国农村改革进入第五个年头。张政民仍然是一个农民，但已不是老辈子意义上的农民了。这一年４月，他承包的花园村建材厂届满到期。算盘一拨，好家伙，一年盈利７万元！
    几天以后的一个傍晚，张家兄弟４人吃着晚饭，嚼着自家腌制的咸萝卜条，弟兄们议论起前些日子邻村挖出的那座古墓。准确地说，那是满满一坑铜钱，更准确地说，那是一坑铜锈。偌大墓穴里，除了一具白骨，全是铜钱，锈迹斑驳陆离。从地面俯视，像一池碧水，幽幽地散发着铜臭。文管会开来大卡车，两天才装完。
    墓主是诸侯？是大臣？是皇亲国戚？弟兄们纷纷猜测。“是守财奴！”张政民冲口而出。
    合同兑现，７万元到手。张政民宣布，我投资６万，办一所花园小学。
    真的，村边那座小学也实在烂得不像样子了。４间东倒西歪的教室，下雨天，过路人竟不敢驻足避雨。几个民办教师都成了生意人，他们贩鸡蛋，贩麸皮，贩桃贩杏，一个月中难得有几个人都在课堂的日子。他们互相关照着，谁替着上一节课，明码标价３角钱。
    这学校，苦了学生，也冷了家长那颗望子成材的心。初小升高小，考及格者寥若晨星，有的学生的试卷上，竟把自己的名字都写得缺横掉点。
    别说像前几年那样成群结队地出大学生了。文盲，硬是一批批无可阻挡地涌现出来。这里，曾孕育过灿烂的青铜文化，产生过中国文学史上开山之作《诗经》。连今天还在使用的农历，也是从这里发祥，远播全国的。但地灵人杰的厚土上，却印满了文化侏儒的足迹。
    谁之过？人人都喊社会虐待了自己，个个都着急慌忙地弄钱。能弄的贪得无厌，怕永远没有说够的日子；弄不来的忿忿不平，骂物价，骂工资，骂贪官，有多少人真正想着教育，把身心献给教育？就在建校工程势如破竹的时候，有那么一个人，把政民拉到一边：“兄弟，６万块，我的妈呀，吓死人了，叫哥点数，怕几天也点不完呢！少捐一万，给哥！你钱来得容易，哥记你一辈子好。”说着，就要跪下。张政民把他拉起来，什么也没有说。又何必说呢？在一些人的眼里，钱是他们终生为之奋斗的圣物。有了钱，就有了盖房的砖瓦木料，就有了儿女结婚的彩礼酒席，就有了埋葬老人时吹吹打打的音响和体面的柏木棺材。但张政民办的是建材厂，不是印币厂，那６万元来得容易吗？１９８０年，他跑前跑后，把建材厂办起来了，可村干部不放心，只让他当副厂长兼采购员。看账面，１９８１年盈利５千元，但谁会知道，他口袋里却有５千元的发票硬是不报。为啥？村里人看厂子一年到头无利可图，不收摊关门才怪！农民么！天天在鸡尻子下等蛋呢！不下蛋，要那鸡干啥？后来搞承包，他每天从早到晚，就像一架开足马力的机器，高速运转。一月半月，没脱过衣服睡觉，嘴唇上皲裂的口子，时时朝外渗血。还有那五花八门不明不白的检查，更让他有口难言，哪一家得罪得起呀！不识相，让你吃不了兜着走吧！那一年秋天，他母亲患病在床，想儿子，说见了政民她就有了精神，但厂子正在紧要关头，他离不开，硬是让母亲临终前没能见儿一面。下葬那天，市建三公司来人察看楼板质量，他穿着孝服，佯欢强笑着介绍完产品后，才跑到母亲坟头哭得山摇地动……这６万元，哪一张不浸透他的汗水和泪水啊！
    ６月筹备，７月动土，８月如期竣工。８月初开学时，出现在人们面前的花园小学变成名副其实的花园了。１１间两层防震教学楼，２１间钢筋混凝土结构平房掩映在花木丛中。举行典礼那天，省市县各级领导纷纷赶来祝贺，锣鼓鞭炮声使这块曾屹立过西周首都的土地激动得发抖。
    　　　　三
    在中国人口中，农民占着多数，但有着小农意识、小农心理的人有多少？怕多得吓人。不信，你在有些领导机关的大楼里，在奔跑的各种小车中去找吧，别看他们着西装革履，带金丝眼镜，留现代发型。一些人，在失却了农民的勤劳和淳朴之后，只把农民的劣根性和掌管的权力结合使用，贪官便当定了。
    区委某负责人便是这种有权力的农民。他身材干瘦，一件洗得发白的三号军装四季都在身上。在他的潜意识中，方圆３０里，似乎都是共产党给他的封地，只是如今不兴蟒袍紫带罢了。在花园小学破土动工到举行典礼那些天，他回家给自己盖楼房去了。那楼房，造价２．５万元，盖得好气魄、好漂亮！依他每月那点工资，只怕把所有的窗帘买齐也不够呢！以后，他从未踏进过离区委近在咫尺的花园小学的校门。张政民这小子为什么要这样折腾？他怎么也想不出来，想得脑子好疼！终于，他悟出来了，名誉这东西是定量的，张政民多了，自己就少了！你张政民办学证明了什么？证明我不重视教育么！好小子，你为给自己搽粉，硬是给我脸上抹黑。咱走着瞧！
    调查张政民的人一批批派出去了。账目，被这些人像梳头发一样梳了一遍又一遍。各种所谓告状信，雪片般飞到各级领导的办公桌上。为了提高效率，他们不惜租了一辆皇冠车东奔西跑。
    接着，说他倒卖钢材的谣言传开了，通报他破坏文物的文件下发了，罗列他十大罪状的传单出笼了。连团中央命名他为新长征突击手的证书也被扣压了。有人扬言可能要逮捕他，有人心更急，说他已被关进了监狱。
    应该承认，对手是够厉害的。所列举的罪状，除了最后一条之外，无论哪一条落实了，都够他喝一壶的。那最后一条有点不伦不类：“张政民是个农民，但他不种地，不养鸡，不养猪，凭什么致富？”可怜的小农心态啊！
    几个兄弟终于忍受不住了。他们哭着，喊着，要砸碎校园这竖立的石碑，撕碎那一面面锦旗，把那一件件奖品踏在脚下，撕心裂肺地哭诉：“啥世道呀！好心没好报！”
    张政民也是常人，那些日子，他常常整夜坐在母亲的坟上，听着沣河翻卷的浪涛，心中阵阵愁苦。谣言这东西真有巨大的优势，置之不理吧，人们会认为你默认了；与之纠缠吧，那你整天就会陷入无休止的辩诬之中，什么事也别想干了。他不知道投资办学这件事危害了谁，做好事也这么难吗？也不明白领导为什么不站出来说句公道话。当初，他们对张政民讲过多少花瓣般的话语呀！张政民，你还不了解中国某些人的习惯心理，他们对状告谁远比对表彰谁要感兴趣得多，他们看表彰材料眼睛是眯着的，而看揭发材料时眼睛是瞪着的。他们需要寻求刺激，以娱乐自己早已麻木或半麻木的心灵。
    他去找新闻界了，他相信舆论的品格和力量。在这一点上，张政民又一次与传统的小农意识拉开了距离。让我们摘录一些报纸的标题吧：
    １９８４年１２月２７日《人民日报》：《农民张政民投资六万元为家乡兴办一所小学》
    １９８５年５月１日《西安晚报》：《专业户自荐当村长，一人富带动全村富》
    １９８５年５月２日新华社电讯稿：《通讯：我伴春风暖花园——记青年农民张政民》
    １９８５年５月３日《陕西日报》：《张政民当村长四个月办起四个厂》
    １９８５年５月１８日《中国乡镇企业报》：《开阔的胸怀——记农民企业家、全国新长征突击手张政民》
    １９８５年５月２１日《中国青年报》：《腰缠十万，不忘扶贫，青年村长张政民帮困难户找富路》
    １９８５年１０月２日《经济参考》：《流言蜚语诋毁先进人物——副省长现场察看辨是非》
    而那位负责人也在《法制周报》《西安晚报》上曝了光。他还有刑讯逼供、伪造学历、骗取文凭、倒买汽车等严重问题呢！

    张政民的家与花园小学仅有一墙之隔。躺在床上，教师的讲课声，学生的读书声，都听得清清楚楚。听这些声音，他觉得是一种享受，一种慰藉。像春夜喜雨的淅沥，如山涧泉水的叮咚，美妙极了，动听极了，这个时候，他心头像有蜜糖在融化，一切烦恼便不复存在了。
    张政民是一棵摇钱树，但，不是谁都能把钱摇下来的。他只给教育投资，捐得大方潇洒。建校投资协议上，说是投资六万元，但到学校建成时，他已交出７．６万元了。为此，他不惜卖掉了汽车，卖掉了企业的设备。以后，师生的校服、教师的岗位津贴、奖金、添置的图书、桌凳和教具，统统都是他拿出来的。遇到资金周转不开的时候，他宁可迟发工人的工资，也不让学校一时为难。天冷了，他给教师发钱买电热褥；天热了，他给教师发钱买电风扇；看到教师伙食不好，他给发放固定的伙食津贴；教师离职进修，他把生活费全部包下……从１９８５年至今，又是５万多元，这一切，又有谁知道？
    张政民似乎默默地和谁较劲？也许是。但有这么个较法吗？不可思议。学校讨论工作，他不请自到，不散不走。调入或聘用新教师，数他这一关最难过。教书心不诚的，人品不端正的，业务上没一手的，搬谁说情也白搭；而一旦看上人了，提啥要求都满足。四年级有个小张宏，总是爱迟到，不做作业。有一天，张政民在校外碰见了他。一问，才知父母离了婚，孩子吃饭没着落。他给孩子擦干了眼泪，揩净了鼻涕，领着找班主任，找校长，最后找到教师灶的炊事员，叮嘱：“让娃在灶上吃饭，你受点麻烦，帐记在我名下！”他还掏出五块钱，领着娃买了支钢笔。隔不几天，就要检查一次他的作业。这，又和谁较劲呢？
    “素质，一切都取决于人的素质！”张政民说，“上一代定型了，神仙都没办法改。教育再上不去，下一代就会鼠目寸光，还会不辨东西，还会人整人，一代一代这样下去，咋办呀！”
    也许张政民的目标过于虚无缥缈，以至近乎梦幻。中国太大了，人口太多了，你能把所有的学校办起来把所有的学生管起来吗？办好一个花园小学就能改变中国未来公民的素质吗？但谁又忍心责怪他，耻笑他，给他泼冷水呢？诚然，一个小学不能改变一代人，不能提高一代人，但他那番衷情那片痴心，或许可以使那些整天做捞钱梦、升官梦、吃喝梦、以权谋私梦、勾心斗角梦以至终日昏睡什么梦也不做的人们产生些微羞赧！国家是广袤的苍穹，人就是一颗星。今夜星光灿烂，不就预示着明天太阳的火红？
    有张政民这样的“名誉校长”，花园小学能不腾飞吗？难怪全乡、全区、乃至全县的教师都向往这所学校呢！他们或托人介绍，或毛遂自荐，要求到花园小学工作。在校的２０名教师，人人都参加了函授、电大学习，谁都怕淘汰，怕调离。方圆几十里的父母们，争着到花园村来投亲靠友，让孩子到花园小学借读。办校四年，在全乡、全区几十所学校的会考中，花园小学连续拿了第一，市、县、区、乡的奖状，硬是捧回了３２张。

    “我办企业为教育！”这几年，张政民的几个厂子越办越红火。为了办化工厂，他背上干粮，跑遍西安地区的大学。产品出来了，要通过鉴定和征集用户，半年中间，他竟往秦岭山中等矿区跑了６０多次。那阵子，他常常头疼，光止疼片就干吞了２００多包。放在嘴里咬碎，拌着唾沫咽下，他说那药片真好，苦得有滋有味，有头有尾……他并不以之为苦，他总说自己钱挣得很舒坦。无论什么时候，他衣着总是整洁，神态自若，言谈文文雅雅。“比起武训，咱没有当驴子去推磨，也没沿街乞讨，打一拳，五个钱，踢一脚，十个钱，”他哈哈地笑着，“钱却比他老汉赚得多，赚得文明，你说是不？”
    是的是的。有了这个认识，张政民不放过任何赚钱的机会，他把经济信息，商品广告一类报纸几乎订全了，他跑遍了中国许多城市。不知为什么，他总爱和高等院校打交道，大事小事，都要教授们帮他拿主意。兰州大学、陕西师范大学、西安公路学院、西安医科大学、西安石油学院、西北政法学院都和他建立了协作关系，他的技术顾问遍布大学的各个专业。他认准了走科技致富的路子，不惜重金买专利，那胆识和气魄，是传统农民无法想象的。在经营上，他恪守信誉，保证质量，供货及时，服务周到。眼下，他获得陕西省科技二等奖的产品——高级润滑油五年的产品供货合同已全部签完。他渴望自己尽快变成大富翁，以便在兴办教育时更有力量。
    １９８８年４月２７日，张政民向斗门乡党委、斗门乡人民政府郑重提出，将自己承包经营的建筑、水泥预制、铸造、化工等企业近几年的收入全捐献出来，建一所斗门初级中学，预计金额３０万元。
    前年９月，张政民来到陕西师范大学丹桂飘香的校园，开始进行为期两年的进修。他不要文凭，只想尽快提高自己。办教育怎能不懂教育呢？况且，他还有一个朴素而美丽的愿望——当一名合格的中学教师。每天上午，他坐在大学生中间，全神贯注地听课。听中国文学、经济学、心理学和教育学。他学得很吃力，很勤奋，没有人逼他，但他总觉得背后有条鞭子悬着似的。一年下来，他记了五厚本笔记。
    老师问他日后还有什么打算，他腼腆地笑了。那双深邃的眼睛，透露出一种充满忧患的深刻、冷峻与成熟。“和小学一样，中学也要办出一流水平。有可能的话，明年想自费出国，看看国外的教育。到四十岁左右，看能不能把大学办出来。”
    这就是张政民。
    他站在沣镐遗址上。
    但愿这块土地上的人不要在古墓中发掘自己的光辉，也不要站在废墟上遥想昨天的灿烂。值得骄傲的只有今天的创造，就像张政民那样！
