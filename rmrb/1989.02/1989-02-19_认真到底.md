	Be Thorough
    Ye Ban
    Everything in the world requires thoroughness. Thoroughness can turn difficult things into easy ones, while carelessness can turn easy things into difficult ones. If we were to ask what is the most difficult task in today's China, it would probably be family planning. Since the Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee, our country has thoroughly implemented the basic state policy of family planning. In 10 years, we have reduced the population by 120 million, making a globally recognized contribution to easing the world's population pressure.

    However, with the liberalization of the economy, the frequency of population movement has also increased. Currently, there are millions of floating population nationwide. This is undoubtedly beneficial for activating the market and creating wealth, but it also brings a major problem: the management of family planning. Millions of floating population have become a "super-fertility guerrilla force." Even some remote towns, like the high-altitude city of Xining, have seen tens of thousands of couples who come to do business and have multiple children.

    For the management of family planning among permanent residents, various places have accumulated a lot of experience; but how to manage family planning among the floating population is still lacking in methods. Now, family planning management departments at all levels are very anxious, and the news and public opinion organs are also constantly calling for action, but the problem often stops at "shouting" without actually "doing."

    To eliminate this blind spot in the management of family planning among the floating population, the family planning authorities and public security, industrial and commercial administration, street committees, and even all sectors of society need to work together. To do a good job in family planning, what is most needed is a meticulous and thorough spirit.

　　认真到底
    叶伴
    世上成事，皆须认真。认真对待难变易，掉以轻心易转难。若论当今中国最难办的一件事是什么？恐怕要数计划生育。党的十一届三中全会以来，我国认真实行计划生育的基本国策，１０年少生１．２亿人口，为减轻全球的人口压力作出了举世公认的贡献。
    然而随着经济放活，人员流动也频繁起来了。目前全国流动人口有上千万。这对于活跃市场、创造财富，无疑是有利的，但同时带来了一大难题，就是计划生育的管理。千百万流动人口成了“超生游击队”，连一些边远地区的城镇，像高原城市西宁，也流进了数以万计的边做生意、边多胎生育的夫妇。
    对于常住人口的计划生育管理，各地积累了不少经验；但流动人口的计划生育怎么管好，至今还缺少办法。现在各级计划生育管理部门很着急，新闻舆论机关也不断呼吁，问题是往往停留于“喊”，没有切实地去“办”。
    消除流动人口这一计划生育管理的死角，需要计划生育主管部门和公安、工商管理、街道乃至全社会的各个环节一起努力。做好计划生育工作这篇文章，最需要一丝不苟、认真到底的精神。
