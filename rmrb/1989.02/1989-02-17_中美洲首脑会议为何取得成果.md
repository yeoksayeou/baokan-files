The fourth summit of the five Central American countries, held to advance the peace process in Central America, concluded on February 14 in El Salvador. This two-day meeting reached an agreement for the first time on the issue of achieving domestic peace in Nicaragua, the main party involved in the Central American conflict. This positive result has opened up a promising prospect for the long-stalled situation in Central America.

The five heads of state reached the following agreements at this meeting: The Nicaraguan government decided to hold elections nine months ahead of schedule in February of the following year, welcoming all political parties to participate in the election, and announced the implementation of press freedom and the release of all political prisoners. At the same time, the five heads of state will formulate a "comprehensive plan" within 90 days to allow the current 13,000 anti-government armed forces stationed in Honduras to lay down their weapons and return home. In addition, the five heads of state also reached agreements on issues such as border security inspections. If these agreements are fully implemented, the conflict in Central America will be basically resolved. This agreement has been supported by various Latin American countries.

After the five Central American countries reached the Central American Peace Agreement, which focuses on ceasefire and democratization, at the second summit in August 1987, there was a good momentum for dialogue on the ceasefire issue between the two sides in Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Guatemala, the three countries with armed conflicts. However, since the second half of last year, the dialogue has completely stopped. The armed conflict in El Salvador has even escalated, causing concern among the countries in Central America. The fourth summit, which was originally scheduled to be held in August last year to review the implementation of the peace agreement, was postponed five times due to differences in opinion. Since last year, the situation in most of the world's hotspots has been moving towards resolution, with the exception of the stalemate in the Central American hotspot.

Observers believe that the success of this summit was achieved by three main factors. First, the development of the situation in Nicaragua itself played a decisive role. Since the United States stopped military aid to the anti-government forces in Nicaragua in February last year, this force, due to a lack of ammunition and supplies, has retreated to Honduras, and the internal war in Nicaragua has significantly decreased. Eight years of civil war have made Nicaragua's economy very difficult, with severe shortages of materials, and last year's inflation rate reached 7,000%, with the people yearning for peace. In this situation, the Nicaraguan government changed its previous hardline stance, agreeing to hold early elections and further open up democracy to seek domestic reconciliation.

Second, the change in the U.S. government's rigid attitude towards the Nicaraguan government is also an important reason. Over the past eight years, the Reagan administration's policy of supporting the anti-government forces to overthrow the current government has failed miserably. The new Bush administration, after coming to power, faced reality and adjusted its Central American policy, expressing a willingness to use diplomacy rather than military means to resolve the Nicaraguan issue and stating that it would continue to stop military aid to the anti-government forces.

Third, the current international détente trend is also a promoting factor for the peace process in Central America. However, the final realization of peace in Central America is not easy. The anti-government forces have expressed their refusal to accept the above agreement. The specific implementation of many plans in the agreement is also not easy. However, the trend is clear, and the prospect of peace in Central America is still bright.

### 中美洲首脑会议为何取得成果

　　中美洲首脑会议为何取得成果
    新华社记者  刘瑞常
    为推进中美洲和平进程而举行的第４次中美洲５国首脑会议１４日在萨尔瓦多结束。这次为期２天的会议就中美洲冲突的主要当事国尼加拉瓜实现国内和平问题第一次达成协议。这一积极成果使处于僵持状态的中美洲局势展现了美好的前景。
    ５国首脑在这次会议上达成如下协议：尼加拉瓜政府决定提前９个月于明年２月举行大选，欢迎全部政党参加竞选，并宣布实行新闻自由，释放全部政治犯。与此同时，５国首脑９０天内制定一个“一揽子计划”，以便让目前驻扎在洪都拉斯境内的１．３万名尼反政府武装分子放下武器，重返家园。此外，５国首脑还就边界安全核查等问题达成了协议。如果这些协议得以彻底实现，中美洲冲突问题将基本解决。这一协议已经得到拉美各国的支持。
    中美洲５国首脑１９８７年８月在第２次会议上达成以停火和民主化为主要内容的中美洲和平协议以后，曾出现尼加拉瓜、萨尔瓦多和危地马拉３个有武装冲突国家的双方就停火问题进行对话的好势头。但是，从去年下半年以来，对话全部停止。萨尔瓦多的武装冲突甚至愈演愈烈，引起中美洲各国的忧虑。５国首脑本应于去年８月举行第４次会议，检查和平协议的执行情况。但由于意见分歧，会议５次延期。去年以来，世界多数热点地区的问题都在趋于解决，唯独中美洲热点的局势处于僵持状态。
    观察家认为，这次首脑会议成果的取得是由３个主要因素促成的。首先，尼加拉瓜本国局势的发展起着决定作用。自去年２月美国停止对尼反政府武装的军援后，这支武装便因弹尽粮绝而龟缩到洪都拉斯境内，尼国内战事明显减少。８年的内战使尼经济十分困难，物资严重匮乏，去年通货膨胀率高达７０００％，人民渴望和平。在这种情况下，尼政府改变了过去的强硬立场，同意提前大选，进一步开放民主，以求国内和解。
    其次，美国政府改变了对尼加拉瓜政府的僵硬态度，也是一个重要原因。８年来，里根政府采取的支持尼反政府武装以期推翻现政府的政策，惨遭失败。布什新政府上台后，正视现实，调整了中美洲政策，表示要用外交而不是军事手段来解决尼加拉瓜问题，并表示将继续停止对尼反政府武装的军援。
    第三，目前国际缓和趋势对中美洲和平进程也是一个促进因素。但是，中美洲和平的最终实现并非易事。尼反政府武装已表示拒绝接受上述协议。协议中许多方案的具体落实也不容易。然而大势所趋，中美洲和平的前景还是光明的。
