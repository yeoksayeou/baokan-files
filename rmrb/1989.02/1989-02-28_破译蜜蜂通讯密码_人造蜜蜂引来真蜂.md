Scientists from the Federal Republic of Germany and Denmark have recently collaborated to create an artificial honeybee that can emit the communication signals of real honeybees.

A recent report from the Federal Republic of Germany's Department of Research Technology states that over the course of 40 million years of evolution, honeybees have developed a highly organized communication system. By varying the rhythm and different dance movements, honeybees can convey signals to their companions indicating the location of food. However, scientists have discovered that the honeybee's dance only has a signaling effect when accompanied by "background music." This is a pulsed sound signal that, when detected by a microphone, sounds like a series of clicks. This signal is generated by the muscles on the bee's wings at a frequency of 260 Hertz and is emitted through the wings.

Recently, in Wurzburg, Federal Republic of Germany, a trial was conducted using the Danish artificial bee. By attaching wings to a diamond framework, the artificial bee can emit clicking sounds corresponding to its dance, indicating that nectar is located within a radius of 100 to 1,000 meters. In this area, small boxes containing the same scent as the artificial bee were placed at various positions and distances. The trial results showed that the honeybees accepted the signals from the artificial bee and swarmed out in response.

A detailed understanding of the biological habits of honeybees holds significant value. Honeybees are sensitive to vibrations and should be kept away from vibrations to avoid the disturbance of passing vehicles. Microphones can also be placed inside the hive to track various sounds, thereby understanding the different activities of the honeybees.

　　破译蜜蜂通讯密码  人造蜜蜂引来真蜂
    新华社波恩２月２６日电  联邦德国和丹麦科学家合作，最近制造出了可发出蜜蜂通讯密码的人造蜜蜂。
    联邦德国研究技术部最近发布的研究成果说，蜜蜂在４０００万年的进化过程中形成了高度组织化的通讯系统。借助节奏和不同的舞蹈动作，蜜蜂可以向同伴传达表示食物所在地的信号。但是科学家们发现，蜜蜂的舞蹈只有加入“伴奏”才有信号作用，它是一种脉冲式声音信号，通过微探测器听起来像一种格格格的声音。这个信号是由翅膀上的肌肉产生的，频率为２６０赫兹，并通过翅膀发射出去。
    最近在联邦德国维尔茨堡试验了丹麦的人造蜜蜂。把翅膀装在金刚石支架上，假蜜蜂能够随着相应的舞蹈发出格格声，表示花蜜在周围１００米至１０００米之间的地方。在这个区域的不同方位、不同距离分散放着极小的、同人造蜜蜂携带的香味相同的香盒。试验结果表明，蜜蜂接受了人造蜂发出的信号并倾巢出动。
    细致入微地了解蜜蜂的生物习性具有很大价值。蜜蜂怕震动的刺激，应使它们避开震动，远离过往的汽车。还可以将微探测器置入蜂房，跟踪蜂房中的各种声音，从中可了解蜜蜂的各种活动。
