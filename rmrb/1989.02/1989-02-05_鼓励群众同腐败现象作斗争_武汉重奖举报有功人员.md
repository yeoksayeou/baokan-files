Wuhan Encourages the Public to Fight Corruption by Rewarding Informants

	Wuhan's procuratorial organs decided yesterday to allocate 5,600 yuan in reward money to 13 informants whose reports on economic crimes have been verified, in order to encourage the public to actively fight against corruption among party and government officials.

	Since the second half of last year, various levels of procuratorial organs in Wuhan have established economic crime reporting centers (stations). By now, the city has received over 1,400 reports from the public on economic crimes such as embezzlement and bribery. Of these, 85% have been investigated and concluded, resulting in the arrest of 129 criminals and the prosecution of 50 individuals. Economic losses amounting to over 4.1 million yuan have been recovered. A responsible person from the Municipal Procuratorate introduced that among these thousands of reports, although a few were found to be inaccurate or unfounded, not a single case of false accusation has been discovered. Based on the public's reports, the procuratorial organs have timely solved a number of major economic cases. For instance, the director of Wuhan Metallurgical Research Institute, Gui Guangqing, was involved in the illegal sale of nickel plates, speculation, and embezzlement amounting to 410,000 yuan; Bear Tao'an and others from the Hubei Provincial Shipping Company's Material Supply Station took advantage of their positions to steal and embezzle over 200,000 yuan in diesel.

	To commend the informants who provided valuable information, Wuhan's procuratorial organs decided to award 2,000 yuan to the informant of the major case involving Gui Guangqing's speculation and embezzlement; 1,000 yuan to the informant of Bear Tao'an's major embezzlement case; and appropriate rewards to the informants of the other 11 cases.

	The responsible person from the Wuhan Municipal Procuratorate stated that the public strongly supports the construction of a clean government and is particularly enthusiastic about reporting economic crimes. For half a year, there has been no day without reports. However, there are indications that the proportion of anonymous reports, driven by fear of retaliation, has increased from around 10% to 35%. This not only brings difficulties to the investigation and resolution of cases but also makes it inconvenient to reward informants. This responsible person pointed out that protecting the legal rights of informants has become a very important task.

　　鼓励群众同腐败现象作斗争
　  武汉重奖举报有功人员
    本报武汉２月４日电  武汉市检察机关昨天决定拿出奖金５６００元，奖励已经查证属实的１３起经济罪案的举报人，以鼓励群众与党政机关工作人员腐败现象作斗争的积极性。
    去年下半年以来，武汉市各级检察机关相继成立了经济罪案举报中心（站）。到目前，全市共受理群众举报贪污、受贿等经济犯罪案件１４００多起，并已查结８５％，依法逮捕案犯１２９名，起诉５０名，挽回经济损失４１０多万元。市检察院负责人介绍说，在这数以千计的举报中，虽有少数失实或不准，但至今没有发现一起诬告陷害。根据群众举报，检察机关及时侦破了一批特大经济案件，其中武汉市冶金研究所所长桂广庆倒卖镍板，投机倒把、贪污受贿达４１万元；湖北省航运公司物资供应站熊桃安等人利用职务方便，盗卖柴油贪污２０余万元。
    为了表彰举报有功人员，武汉市检察机关决定给予桂广庆特大投机倒把、贪污受贿案举报有功人员奖金２０００元；给予熊桃安特大贪污案的举报人奖金１０００元，其他１１件案件举报人也分别受到了奖励。
    武汉市检察院负责人说，群众对党政机关廉政建设十分支持，对经济案件举报尤其踊跃，半年来几乎一天也没有间断。然而，有迹象表明，害怕打击报复而采取匿名方式举报的越来越多。匿名举报的比例已由１０％左右上升到３５％。这不仅给侦查破案带来了困难，也给奖励举报有功人员带来不便。这位负责人指出，保护举报人的合法权益，已成为十分重要的工作。
