Title: The "Lottery Savings" Craze by West Lake

There were no decorations, and no singing and dancing, but as the people of Hangzhou by West Lake welcomed 1989, the shadow of inflation had not yet dissipated, and there were still many complaints to be vented.

Despite this, the streets of Hangzhou were still filled with the sound of firecrackers on New Year's Eve. The local post office said that the number of New Year's greeting cards sent this year far exceeded last year's, reaching a staggering 9 tons!

At the start of the new year, there were no signs of a "cash withdrawal and panic buying" frenzy in Hangzhou, which had been a concern for the city's mayors. Instead, in front of some banks, scenes of crowded queues became a major "spectacle" in the new year's Hangzhou.

Unlike the chaotic summer of the previous year, the crowds rushing to the banks this time were not in a panic to withdraw money, but rather to deposit money into the banks, forming long, impressive queues on the streets of the new year.

The sudden change at the bank entrances was due to an interesting tactic that emerged two months ago: "lottery savings." When you purchase a savings certificate with a term of several years for 20 yuan, you can immediately draw a lottery ticket from a box. This mysterious lottery box was almost like a department store—from color TVs, refrigerators, bicycles, leather jackets, to drinks, MSG, cigarettes, toothpaste, soap, and dishwashing liquid, etc. Everyone who participated got a prize, and luck would determine the outcome.

For a while, news about the "lottery" became a popular topic of conversation among the people of Hangzhou.

"Fortune is with you"—the advertisement board in front of the bank showed a considerate temptation. People swarmed in, braving the bitter cold, eagerly queuing up. "Ah, I drew a color TV!" "Oh, it's just a toothpaste, bad luck!" The occasional bursts of excited shouts...

A young couple originally wanted to try a different way to entertain their son, so they bought 3 savings certificates. The son said, "I just want to draw 3 bottles of active milk!" Unexpectedly, the small hand drew out a large color TV, and the family was overjoyed.

A passing government official couldn't resist the temptation, spending all the 200 yuan he had on hand on the "lottery." He later said, "The scene was so exciting, no less than the New York Stock Exchange often seen on TV."

A young worker, in the shape of a laborer, once bought several thousand yuan worth of savings certificates, only drawing a large pile of drinks. He seemed not yet satisfied and said to the person next to him, "It's quite interesting!"

Here, although the outcomes for each person were quite different, there were no complaints or accusations of "unfair distribution" that are currently popular. People's psychological balance seemed to have found a harmonious fulcrum.

The "lottery savings" also brought some trouble to the new year's Hangzhou. A certain bank branch made a mistake in the rush and announced the "lottery" stoppage in advance, which angered the crowd that had been waiting for hours, almost causing a "riot." Someone worried, "Now the bank is almost like a department store," and someone criticized, "This is a disguised form of gambling" and "It affects social order."

Although the pros and cons of "lottery savings" can be discussed by "commentators," its displayed enormous energy brought an unexpected surprise to the local financial sector. News from various specialized banks said that the unprecedented decline in savings had miraculously reversed, and the shortage of production funds after macro-adjustment had eased. A situation report from the Zhejiang Industrial and Commercial Bank stated, "Wherever 'lottery savings' are held, there is a bustling scene, and deposits rise," and "lottery savings have become the turning point for the decline and rise."

"It's really unbelievable," an official from a major bank in the province sighed. Not long ago, when this official talked about the sharp decline in savings, he was somewhat worried and thought that there were few solutions and little hope.

Interestingly, the "lottery savings" that caused a sensation and spread rapidly in the local financial sector was not created by a learned expert or authority, but by an underdeveloped mountain county.

The bank was struggling to attract a large amount of social funds, and the people hoped to gain more benefits from their limited cash. When the two were in stark contrast, it seemed that the seemingly irregular and somewhat vulgar "lottery" would produce such a huge "aggregation effect." This seems to confirm a theorist's view: solving China's many reform problems requires imagination beyond the norm!

Perhaps, the bustling scene in front of Hangzhou's banks is sending a meaningful New Year's message to the people...

### 西子湖畔“摸奖”热

　　西子湖畔“摸奖”热
    本报记者  高海浩
    没有张灯结彩，也不见载歌载舞，当西子湖畔的杭州人迎来１９８９年的时候，通货膨胀的阴影尚未散去，诸多牢骚还要宣泄。
    尽管如此，杭州城的元旦前夜依然响起送旧迎新的爆竹声声。当地邮局说，人们互致新年祝福的明信片大大超过去年，竟达９吨之多！
    新年伊始，杭州城尚无“提款抢购风”再起的迹象，这是市长们早先颇为担忧的。而在一些银行门前不时爆出人流如潮的场面，成为新年杭州城的一大“奇观”。
    与去年骚动不安的夏季截然不同：此时涌向银行的人流，不见争相取款的恐慌，而是竞相把钱投入银行，并从这里甩出一条条新年街头颇为壮观的“长龙”。
    银行门前的骤然变化，源自两个月前冒出的一种有趣的招数：“摸奖储蓄”。当你认购一张存期几年的２０元储蓄单，当场可在一个箱子里摸一张奖券。这种神秘的奖券箱几乎如同一家百货商店——从彩电、冰箱、自行车、皮茄克，到饮料、味精、香烟、牙膏、香皂、洗洁精等等，参加者人人有奖，运气如何，即见分晓。
    一时间，关于“摸奖”的消息成了杭州人津津乐道的一大话题。
    “幸运与您同在”——银行门前的广告牌显示出善解人意的诱惑。人们蜂拥而来，冒着凛冽的寒风，乐此不疲地排队等候。“啊，我摸到了彩电！”“哎呀，又是一支牙膏，臭手！”不时爆出的一阵阵充满快感的嚷嚷……
    一对年轻夫妇原想换一种玩法，让儿子一乐，认购了３张储蓄单。儿子说：“我就想摸３瓶活性乳！”不料那双小手居然摸出一台大彩电，一家人欣喜若狂。
    有位过路的机关干部经不住诱惑，掏尽所带的２００元，投入“摸奖”，他事后说：“那场面太刺激人了，绝不亚于电视上常见的纽约股票交易所。”
    有位工人模样的青年一次认购了数千元储蓄单，只摸到一大堆饮料，而他似乎尚未尽兴地对旁人说：“蛮有趣！”
    在这里，尽管各人所得十分悬殊，却听不到时下颇为流行的诸如“分配不公”的抱怨、责备。人们的心理天平仿佛找到了一种和谐平衡的支点。
    “摸奖储蓄”也给新年的杭州城带来了麻烦。某家银行办事处忙中出错，提前宣布“摸奖”中止，激怒了久已等候数小时的人群，几乎酿成一场“骚乱”。有人担忧：“现在的银行几乎成了百货公司”，也有人批评：“这是变相赌博”“影响了社会秩序”。
    尽管“摸奖储蓄”的利弊长短，“评论家”们大可探讨一番，而它显示的巨大能量给此间金融界带来了始料不及的惊喜。来自各家专业银行的新年消息说：建国以来罕见的储蓄大滑坡已奇迹般回升，宏观调整后出现的生产资金奇缺有所缓和。浙江省工商银行的一份情况简报称：“哪儿开办‘摸奖’储蓄，哪儿就热火朝天，存款上升”，“摸奖储蓄成了制降回升的转折点”。
    “真是不可思议。”省里某大银行的一位官员感慨地说。就在不久前，这位官员谈及储蓄大幅度下跌时，不无忧愁地认为：办法不多，希望不大。
    颇有意思的是：在此间金融界引起震动、风行一时的“摸奖储蓄”，其“首创者”并非学识丰富的专家权威，竟是尚不发达的一个山区小县。
    银行苦于难以大量吸纳社会游资，老百姓企求有限的钞票获得更多的实惠，而当两者颇为矛盾之时，看来并不规则、颇为俗气的“摸奖”，竟会产生如此巨大的“聚合效应”。这似乎印证了一位理论家的见解：解决中国改革的诸多难题，需要超越常规的想象力！
    也许，杭州银行门前的热闹场面，正向人们传递着意味深长的新年昭示……
