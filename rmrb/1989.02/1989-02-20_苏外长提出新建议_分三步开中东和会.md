Soviet Foreign Minister Proposes New Suggestions
for a Three-Step Middle East Peace Conference

	New York Times, Cairo, February 18 - According to news from Damascus, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze today proposed a new Soviet initiative in the Syrian capital of Damascus. The initiative involves three steps to prepare for an international peace conference in the Middle East.

	The news reported that Shevardnadze made this proposal during a speech at a banquet hosted by Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Shara.

	Shevardnadze said the first step is to activate the United Nations Security Council. He stated, "We are prepared to consider this issue at a special ministerial-level meeting of the Security Council."

	The Soviet Foreign Minister said the second step is to strengthen consultations among the five permanent members of the Security Council and to engage in contacts with all parties involved in the Middle East issue, so that it can serve as a preparatory body for the convening of the Middle East peace conference.

	He said the third step is that the United Nations and its Secretary-General can also make peace efforts in other flexible ways that are acceptable to all parties involved in the conflict.

	Shevardnadze said the preparatory phase could take 6 to 9 months.

	Shevardnadze said that the Soviet Union believes that now is the time to work towards convening an international peace conference in the Middle East. The conference should include all parties involved in the conflict, including the Palestine Liberation Organization, and the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council.

	Shevardnadze held talks with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad today regarding the new Soviet initiative and handed over a letter from Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to Assad.

	The Soviet Foreign Minister arrived in Damascus on February 17 for a two-day visit to Syria. Syria is the first stop on his current Middle East tour, and he will also visit Jordan, Egypt, Iraq, and Iran.

　　苏外长提出新建议
    分三步开中东和会
    新华社开罗２月１８日电  据来自大马士革的消息说，苏联外长谢瓦尔德纳泽今天在叙利亚首都大马士革提出了苏联关于分三个步骤为召开中东和平国际会议作准备的新建议。
    消息说，谢瓦尔德纳泽是在叙利亚外长沙雷为他举行的宴会上发表讲话时提出这一新建议的。
    谢瓦尔德纳泽说，第一个步骤是使联合国安理会行动起来。他说：“我们已准备在安理会召开的一次外长级特别会议上考虑这一问题。”
    苏外长说，第二个步骤是加强安理会５个常任理事国之间的协商，并同中东问题有关各方进行接触，使之起到召开中东和平国际会议的筹备机构的作用。
    他说，第三个步骤是，联合国及其秘书长的和平努力也可以在有关冲突各方都能接受的、灵活的其他方式下进行。
    谢瓦尔德纳泽说，筹备阶段的时间可以确定为６个月至９个月。
    谢瓦尔德纳泽说，苏联认为，现在正是为召开中东和平国际会议而努力的时候了，会议应由包括巴解组织在内的有关冲突各方和联合国安理会５个常任理事国的参加。
    谢瓦尔德纳泽今天同叙利亚总统阿萨德就苏联的新建议举行了会谈，并转交了苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫给阿萨德的一封信。
    苏外长是１７日抵达大马士革对叙利亚进行为期两天的访问的。叙利亚是他此次中东之行的第一站，他还将访问约旦、埃及、伊拉克和伊朗。
