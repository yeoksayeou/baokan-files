Young and middle-aged actors in Shenyang are making a name for themselves. According to Xinhua News Agency in Shenyang, a 26-year-old performer from the Shenyang Acrobatics Troupe, Gao Jin, was recently promoted to the rank of first-class performer, with his salary increasing by 10 levels. Despite his young age, limited education, and artistic training, many consider him to be quite talented. He won the highest award at the Paris International Circus Festival with his breathtaking "High Car Kick Bowl" act.

There are many middle-aged and young performers like Gao Jin in Shenyang's seven professional performing arts troupes. Statistics show that out of the 82 first and second-class performers currently employed, two-thirds are under the age of 45.

While fully utilizing the strengths of veteran performers, the Shenyang Municipal Bureau of Culture has established teams primarily composed of middle-aged and young performers. During the rehearsal process for key performances, they consciously place middle-aged and young performers in leading roles. They also send promising young talents to higher art academies for further study. To create an environment conducive to the emergence of outstanding performers, many performing arts troupes insist on holding basic skills and technical performance competitions.

　　沈阳中青年演员脱颖而出
    据新华社沈阳电  （沈阳日报记者齐世明、本社记者魏运亨）２６岁的沈阳杂技团演员高进前不久被破格评聘为一级演员，工资连升了１０个档次。论年龄、学力及艺术修养，这个小伙子被不少人认为“嫩了点儿”。但他以令人叫绝的“高车踢碗”而荣获巴黎世界明日杂技节最高大奖。
    像高进这样受到破格奖掖的中青年演员，在沈阳市七个专业艺术表演团体中并非少数。据统计，目前全市８２名在职的一、二级演员中，４５岁以下的就占２／３。
    沈阳市文化局在充分发挥老演员作用的同时，设立了以中青年演员为主体的团队；在排练重点剧目的过程中，有意识地把中青年演员推到主角位置；选送有前途的青年到高等艺术院校深造；为了创造出脱颖而出的“小气候”，不少艺术表演团体坚持举办基本功技术表演赛。
