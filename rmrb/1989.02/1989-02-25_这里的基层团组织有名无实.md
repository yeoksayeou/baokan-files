Title: The Grassroots Youth League Organizations Here Are Mere Names

In the second half of last year, I spent some time in Penglai Township in my county and discovered that the grassroots Youth League organizations there were severely paralyzed. The leisure activities of young people were quite meager, and negative trends were on the rise. A young person told me that he joined the Youth League when he was in middle school in 1976. After returning to the countryside to farm for over ten years, although there is a Youth League branch in the village, no new members have been recruited, and no activities have been organized. It exists in name only.

Because the grassroots Youth League organizations have not truly functioned, rural youth find their lives monotonous and dreary after a day of farming. Many have developed the bad habit of gambling.

Penglai Township is one of the two poorest townships in our county, with an average annual income of less than 200 yuan last year. I hope that the Youth League organizations here can revive and invigorate themselves, leading all the youth in the township to excel in the path of poverty alleviation and prosperity.

　　这里的基层团组织有名无实
    去年下半年，我在我县彭赖乡呆过一段时间，发现这里的基层团组织严重瘫痪，青年的业余生活十分贫乏，歪风邪气上升。一个青年告诉我，他是１９７６年上中学时入团的，回乡务农也有１０多年了，村里虽有团支部，但未见发展过团员，也从未开展过活动，名存实亡。
    由于基层团组织没有真正发挥作用，农村青年种田之余感到生活单调、苦闷，好多人染上了赌博恶习。
    彭赖乡是我县两个最贫困乡之一，去年人均收入不到２００元。希望这里的团组织重整旗鼓，振奋精神，带领全乡青年在治穷致富的道路上大显身手。
