The preparations for the Central Television Spring Festival Gala are in the final stages. Hu Qili, Li Tieying, and Rui Xingwen visited the rehearsal site this afternoon to meet with the actors and staff who have been working tirelessly on this program.

Approximately 500 actors and 200 staff members are participating in the gala. Hu Qili expressed his belief that their hard work will be appreciated by the general public. However, he said, it is impossible to please everyone. As long as the main theme is prominent and the majority are satisfied, that would be a great success. Upon learning that the two executive directors are young, Hu Qili wished them to surpass the older generation.

　　胡启立等到中央电视台看望春节晚会剧组人员
    新华社北京２月３日电  中央电视台今年春节联欢晚会节目的准备工作进入最后阶段。胡启立、李铁映、芮杏文今天下午到排练现场看望正为这台节目夜以继日工作的演员和工作人员。
    参加晚会演出的演员约有５００人，工作人员有２００人。胡启立表示相信，他们的辛勤劳动一定能得到广大群众的肯定。但是他说，也不可能人人都满意，只要主旋律突出了，大多数人满意，就是很大的成功。当得知两位执行导演是年轻人，胡启立祝他们胜过老一代。
