On December 18th of last year, the 411th train from Hunan's Hengyang to Guangdong's Zhanjiang departed from Hengyang. Along the route, some stations had rice vendors carrying sacks of rice onto the train, intending to sell them at higher prices in Guangdong and Guangxi. When the passenger car stopped at our county's Jingtouhu station, over a hundred rice vendors stuffed sacks of rice onto the train. Almost every car's aisle, under the seats, and in the washrooms were filled with sacks of rice. Some train crew members even voluntarily opened the crew rest rooms and broadcast rooms to store the rice. In car 11, a crew member, after receiving 11 yuan in "convenience fees" from a vendor, demanded that the vendor sell all the rice to him. Due to the overcrowding of passengers and cargo, the train was severely overloaded and was forced to stop at Jingtouhu station for over 4 hours.

Upon learning of this situation, the county committee, county government, and leaders of Jingtouhu district immediately organized relevant personnel to rush to the scene and cooperate with railway department officials to inspect the train. However, some crew members not only refused to cooperate but also argued with the inspectors. This incident caused the train to be delayed for another 4 hours.

Relevant personnel inspected and found a total of 15 tons of rice on the train.

　　列车员帮助米贩子运大米
    去年１２月１８日，湖南衡阳至广东湛江的４１１次列车从衡阳开出后，沿途一些车站就有米贩子把一袋袋大米带上车，准备运往广东、广西高价出售。当客车停靠在我县的井头墟车站时，又有百余名米贩子将成袋的大米塞上车。几乎每节车厢的过道上、座位下、洗漱间都塞有装满大米的麻袋。有的列车员还主动打开列车员休息室和广播室，让米贩子存放大米。１１号车厢一个列车员在索取了一个米贩子１１元“方便费”后，还要这个米贩子将大米全部转卖给他。由于车上客、货拥挤，超载严重，列车在井头墟车站停了４个多小时。
    我县县委、县政府及井头墟区的领导同志得知这一情况后，立即组织有关人员赶赴现场，协同铁道部门的同志上车清查。但是，个别列车员不仅不予配合，还与检查人员争吵。这次客车为此又耽误了４个多小时。
    有关人员从这次客车上共清查出大米１５吨。
