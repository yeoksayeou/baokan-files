	Iran and Iraq Agree to Resume Direct Talks

	United Nations, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The foreign ministers of Iran and Iraq have agreed to hold direct talks in late March to continue discussions on fully implementing United Nations Security Council Resolution 598 regarding the settlement of the Iran-Iraq conflict.

	This announcement was made today by UN Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar after a "three-party meeting" with the foreign ministers of the two countries at the UN headquarters. He expressed his sincere hope that this would be a new impetus for the peace process between Iran and Iraq.

	According to the UN Secretary-General's statement, the direct talks between Iran and Iraq in March will be held in New York under his personal chairmanship, but not at the UN headquarters.

	Preparatory talks will begin this month between UN officials and representatives from both countries.

	Since the ceasefire began on August 20 last year, Iran and Iraq have held three rounds of direct talks at the foreign minister level in Geneva and New York. However, due to differences on a series of issues, the talks were suspended, and the peace process was hindered.

　　在联合国秘书长积极推动下    
    两伊同意恢复直接谈判
    本报联合国２月１０日电  记者刘开宸报道：伊朗和伊拉克外长已同意在３月下旬举行直接会谈，继续讨论如何全面执行关于解决两伊冲突的安理会５９８号决议问题。
    这是联合国秘书长佩雷斯·德奎利亚尔今天下午在联合国总部与两伊外长一起举行“三方会谈”后宣布的。他表示诚恳地希望这是对两伊和平进程的一个新的推动。
    根据联合国秘书长的声明，３月份的两伊直接会谈将在秘书长亲自主持下在纽约举行，但不在联合国总部。
    本月内将由联合国官员与两伊代表团开始预备性的会谈。
    两伊自去年８月２０日开始停火后，在日内瓦和纽约举行过三轮外长级的直接会谈，但由于双方在一系列问题上意见分歧，会谈中断，和平进程受阻。
