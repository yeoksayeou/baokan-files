Recently, several concerning issues have emerged in the pharmaceutical industry of Lianyungang City:

Firstly, the pharmaceutical market is in disarray due to the proliferation of numerous distributors. In recent years, new pharmaceutical businesses have been springing up, including those run by hospitals, individuals, and community organizations. These businesses lack the necessary qualifications, such as certificates, permits, and business licenses as required by the drug administration regulations. They also lack technical personnel, adequate storage facilities, equipment, working capital, and means of drug testing. Their business strategy is to "make a profit, make a move; no profit, no move." Some individual drug peddlers roam the streets, further disrupting the market order.

Secondly, counterfeit and substandard drugs are flooding the market, and the practice of kickbacks is becoming increasingly rampant. For instance, a certain hospital in Guanyun County produces large-volume infusions and disposable infusion sets, which have been sold to various medical institutions across the city. These counterfeit and substandard drugs have managed to dominate the market, pushing out genuine products approved for sale by the medical and health authorities. The main tactic used by these distributors is to use money to pave the way and offer substantial kickbacks as bait, thereby winning over procurement units and pharmacy staff. They not only offer meals and drinks but also provide significant kickbacks.

Thirdly, currently, the inventory of drugs in various levels of pharmaceutical companies is decreasing, and there is a shortage of essential drugs, making it difficult for hospitals to procure medications. Apart from objective factors, this situation is also related to the proliferation of numerous drug distributors and the practice of multi-level drug reselling. Some illegal businesses specialize in reselling scarce drugs. Many high-quality drugs have been displaced by counterfeit and substandard ones, making it impossible for state-owned pharmaceutical companies to take responsibility for the market. In the event of an epidemic, how can the health of the people be guaranteed?

We appeal to the provincial and municipal health administrative departments to resolutely rectify the chaotic situation in the pharmaceutical market and ensure the health of the people.

　　连云港医药市场亟待整顿
    近来，连云港市医药行业出现了一些令人担忧的问题：
    一、“百家经销药品”，医药市场秩序混乱。近年来，新的医药经营单位不断涌现，有医院办的，有个人办的，也有群众团体办的。这些经营单位一无药品管理法规定的合格证、许可证、营业执照；二无相应的技术人员；三无必要的仓库和设备；四无流动资金；五无药品检测手段。他们的经营方针是“大利大干，小利小干，无利不干”。一些个体药贩走街串巷，扰乱了医药市场秩序。
    二、伪劣药品充斥市场，回扣之风愈演愈烈。如灌云县某医院自制的大输液和一次性输液器已推销给全市各医疗单位，经医药卫生部门批准销售的大输液却被挤出了市场。这些伪劣药品之所以能占领医药市场，经销人的主要手段是以钱开路，以回扣为诱饵，拉拢进货单位和药房人员，不仅请吃请喝，而且给予相当可观的回扣。
    三、现在，各级医药公司药品库存下降，紧缺品种增多，医院用药困难。除客观因素外，与百家经销药品和多方倒卖药品有一定的关系。一些非法经营单位专门倒卖紧俏药品，不少优质药品被伪劣药品挤掉，以致国营医药公司无法对市场负责，一旦疾病流行，人民健康何以保证？
    呼吁省、市卫生行政部门坚决治理医药市场混乱的局面，确保人民身体健康。
