In mid-December of last year, we conducted an inspection of the annual dues collection and payment situation in 30 party branches within our department. We found that most party members pay their dues on time, and most party branches have designated personnel responsible for this task. However, some units have issues with the collection and management of dues, primarily manifested in the following ways:

1. **Delays in Remitting Dues**: In one unit, one-third of the party members had not paid their dues for three months, and some members only paid after repeated reminders from organizational committee members. There are also instances of party members underpaying or failing to pay their dues. Some units, after receiving dues from party members, do not remit them to the organizational departments within the specified time. Two branches had not remitted any dues for an entire year.

2. **Negligence in Dues Management, Lack of Designated Personnel**: In some units, party members or party small group leaders do not know whom to give their dues to. Some units designate personnel to handle dues remittance at the last minute, and in a few cases, there have even been instances of misappropriating dues.

To strengthen the collection and management of dues, we believe that organizational departments should establish a dues collection and management responsibility system. Party members should be educated to pay their dues on time, and those who fail to pay for six months or more should be dealt with seriously according to the party constitution.

### 应重视党员交纳党费中的问题

　　应重视党员交纳党费中的问题
    去年十二月中旬，我们对我部三十个党支部的全年党费收交情况作了一次检查，发现大多数党员能按时交纳党费，多数党支部有专人负责。但是，个别单位在党费的收交和管理上，存在着一些问题。主要表现在：
    上交党费不及时。有一个单位三分之一的党员三个月没交党费，有的党员需组织委员多次催促才交。党员少交、漏交党费的现象也比较突出。有些单位收到党员交纳的党费后，不按规定时间向组织部门上交。有两个支部的党费长达一年之久分文未交。
    党费管理工作松懈，无专人负责。有的单位的党员或党小组负责人不知道向谁交纳党费。还有的单位上交党费时，临时指定人员负责，甚至个别单位还出现了挪用党费的情况。
    为了加强对党费的收交和管理工作，我们认为，组织部门应健全党费收交管理责任制，教育党员按期交纳党费，对六个月以上不交党费的党员，应按党章规定严肃处理。
