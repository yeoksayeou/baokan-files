One summer day in 1988, four young girls from a rural area in a southern province of China decided to end their lives by drowning, seeking happiness in the afterlife.

An investigation by the provincial Women's Federation found that in recent years, more than 10 cases of rural girls committing suicide together in the province shared certain commonalities: the victims were all in their prime, most had only primary school education or less, and many were active thinkers with no known bad records.

Experts from the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medical Science pointed out that suicide has become the leading cause of accidental deaths. In rural areas, suicide accounts for one-third of all accidental deaths.

Data from the National Comprehensive Disease Surveillance System shows that the suicide rate among women in China is significantly higher than that among men, with women showing a stronger tendency towards suicide. Among suicide cases, 46.18% were due to family disputes, 19.26% were due to prolonged illnesses, and 9.49% were due to failed relationships. The peak ages for accidental deaths in cities are 15 to 40 and 65. In rural areas, the peak ages for suicide are 15 to 24 and 65. Investigations revealed that common pre-suicide behaviors include complaining to friends and family, restlessness, inability to work normally, crying, reduced social activities, not eating, and staying indoors.

Professor Zheng Qing Si from the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medical Science told the reporter, "In recent years, suicides due to failed relationships and elderly people due to care issues have been frequent. On the other hand, suicides due to economic disputes are relatively rare, as China's commodity economy is not yet fully developed, and the main form of ownership is public. Economic issues do not affect individuals as severely as in some capitalist countries. Additionally, suicides due to work disputes, neighborhood disputes, and fear of punishment are also rare." She and her colleagues suggest implementing a national system for monitoring accidental deaths and conducting comprehensive research on the factors leading to these deaths to establish effective preventive measures.

Many materials indicate that 70% of female suicide cases occur among rural girls; male youth suicides are also predominantly among farmers. On this, the director of the Youth Research Room at the Institute of Sociology, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, Dan Guang Nai, said, "The living conditions and educational opportunities for rural youth are not as good as those for urban youth. Social changes have made the urban-rural gap more pronounced, and the spread of movies and television has broadened the horizons of rural youth. Some rural youth are dissatisfied with their current situation, and various constraints make their aspirations difficult to achieve, often leading to psychological suppression and suicide."

Dan Guang Nai said, "During social changes, the pace of life accelerates, and traditional behavioral norms dissolve due to social reorganization, while new norms are not yet established. In this situation, some people easily become confused, experience heavy psychological burdens, and have tense interpersonal relationships, sometimes leading to extreme actions. Society as a whole should pay attention to the mental health of modern people. The psychological counseling clinics and mental health consultation agencies that have been set up in various places can rescue a large number of people on the brink of psychological collapse. China's folk mediation organizations can also play a role in rescuing suicide attempters."

In January 1988, four young people in their thirties established the first suicide prevention center in China, the Pei Ai Center, in Guangzhou. In just one year, the center received over 140 phone calls, 600 letters, and dozens of in-person consultations seeking help.

May the love and care spread across the land, reaching out to those in despair!

    １９８８年夏日的一天，南方某省的４个农村少女，结伴投水，去寻求“来世”幸福。
    省妇联的调查组发现，近年来该省１０多起农村少女结伴自杀事件均有某些共同点：死者正当妙龄，绝大多数只有初小以下文化程度，不少人思想活跃，都不曾有过“劣迹”。
    中国预防医学科学院一些专家指出：自杀，已成为导致意外死亡的第一位原因，在农村，自杀在意外死亡中可达１／３。
    全国综合疾病监测系统提供的资料表明，我国女性已遂自杀明显高于男性，女性自杀倾向远强于男性。自杀者中，４６．１８％的人是因为家庭纠纷，１９．２６％是因为久病不愈，失恋者占９．４９％。城市意外死亡高峰在１５至４０岁和６５岁这两个年龄组。在农村，自杀高峰是１５至２４岁、６５岁年龄组。据调查，自杀前的反常表现，主要有：向亲友诉说遭遇、烦躁不安、不能正常工作、哭泣、社会活动减少、不吃饭、闭门不出等。
    中国预防医学科学院郑庆斯副教授告诉记者：“近年来，失恋和老年人因赡养问题导致的自杀屡屡发生。相反，因为经济纠纷而自杀的人较少，因为我国商品经济不够发达，而且主要是全民所有制，经济问题对个人不像有些资本主义国家那样严重。此外，因工作纠纷、邻里纠纷和畏罪自杀的也很少。”她及其同行们建议，在全国进行意外死亡系统监测，对意外死亡发生因素进行全面研究，以建立一套有效的预防措施。
    许多材料表明，少女自杀事件的７０％发生在农村少女中间；男青年中的自杀者也多为农民。对此，中国社会科学院社会学所青少年研究室主任单光鼐认为：“农村青年的生活条件、受教育机会等不如城市青年优越。社会变迁使城乡反差更加分明，电影、电视的传播又扩大了农村青年的视野。一些农村青年一方面不安于现状，同时由于种种制约又使他们的追求难以实现，心理的极度压抑往往导致自杀。”
    单光鼐说，社会变迁过程中，生活节奏加快，传统的行为准则因社会改组而瓦解，新的又一时难以确立。在这种情况下，有的人容易迷茫，心理负荷过重，人际关系紧张，有时容易走极端。全社会应当关注现代人的精神卫生问题，各地陆续开设的一些心理治疗门诊部、精神卫生咨询机构，可以大量救助处于心理崩溃边缘的人。我国的民间调解组织也可以发挥它救助自杀者的作用。
    １９８８年１月，４名３０岁出头的青年在广州草创了我国第一家防治自杀中心——培爱中心。短短一年里，已经有１４０多个电话、６００多封信和数十名登门咨询者，向这家中心求助。
    愿神州处处广培爱心，向绝望者伸出援助之手！
