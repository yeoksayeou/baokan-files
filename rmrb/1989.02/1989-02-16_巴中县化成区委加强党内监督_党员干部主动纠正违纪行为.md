The Huacheng District Committee of Bazhong County, Sichuan Province, has strengthened party supervision since March of last year.

The Huacheng District Committee of the Communist Party of China has adopted various forms such as democratic appraisal, direct dialogue, and setting up criticism boxes to supervise party members and cadres in six key areas. These areas include: failing to implement the party's line, principles, and policies; not participating in organizational activities; using power for personal gain; using public funds for private purposes; accepting bribes; holding extravagant banquets for weddings and funerals; demanding gifts and money; illegally occupying farmland for construction; illegally cutting down trees; exceeding family planning quotas; causing disunity within the leadership; engaging in superstition, gambling, and disrupting social order. Those who voluntarily expose their misconduct and correct it within a specified period will be dealt with leniently. Those who are reported and exposed by the masses and found to be true will be dealt with severely.

Over the past year, 15 party members in this district have voluntarily exposed the issue of illegally occupying land for construction. Some have voluntarily demolished buildings and restored farmland, while others have completed the construction procedures and paid the land fees. They have all been legally dealt with. The leadership of the Party Committee and the government of Sili Ridge Township once experienced disunity. With the help of the district committee, from the secretary and township head to the general members, they all voluntarily examined their problems in democratic life meetings, found the causes of disunity, and achieved mutual understanding. The criticism box in Zitong Temple Township exposed the issue of the township head not following the proper procedures to approve the illegal occupation of land for construction. The district committee and the district disciplinary committee promptly investigated and verified the issue, decided to demolish the buildings and restore the farmland, and immediately implemented the decision.

　　巴中县化成区委加强党内监督    
    党员干部主动纠正违纪行为
    本报讯  四川省巴中县化成区从去年３月以来，加强了党内监督工作。
    中共化成区委采用民主评议、直接对话、设置揭短意见箱等形式，对党员干部着重从６个方面进行监督。凡是不执行党的路线方针政策、不参加组织活动，或以权谋私、假公济私、贪污受贿，或红白喜事大操大办、索取礼物钱财，或乱占耕地建房、乱砍伐树木和超计划生育，或在班子中闹不团结，或搞封建迷信、赌博、扰乱社会治安等，自己将丑亮出来，并限期改正的，处理从轻；经群众检举揭发并核实的，处理从严。
    近一年来，这个区有１５名党员自我揭出乱占土地建房问题，有的自觉拆房还耕，有的补办了建房手续和补交了土地费，他们都被依法作了处理。寺岭乡党委和政府领导成员曾一度闹不团结，他们在区委的帮助下，从书记、乡长到一般成员都在民主生活会上主动检查自己存在的问题，找出不团结的原因，取得了相互间的谅解。梓桐庙乡揭出该乡乡长未按规定程序报批、乱占土地建房问题，区委和区纪委及时调查核实后作出了拆房还耕的决定，并立即付诸实施。 　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（尹世全　张友碧　范申华）
