Shanghai's industrial structure adjustment is fully underway. The first batch of 126 industrial products subject to controlled technical renovation investment and restricted production capacity expansion has been published and distributed.

According to the guidance of the municipal government leaders, "without pain and sacrifice, there is no adjustment." Shanghai's industrial structure adjustment work is now fully underway. Currently, the first batch of 126 industrial products subject to controlled technical renovation investment and restricted production capacity expansion has been published and distributed.

Adjusting the industrial structure is the fundamental path for Shanghai to survive and develop. This issue was clearly raised a few years ago. However, due to the fact that Shanghai's products have a market, enterprises have profits, and technology has advantages, some departments and enterprises lack a sense of urgency for structural adjustment. In the current situation of overall shortages of funds, energy, raw materials, and foreign exchange, the Shanghai municipal government has decided to make real efforts in structural adjustment over the next two years, to "cut to the bone" in some areas, and to fully rationalize industrial relations.

"Resources and efficiency" are the two major axes of Shanghai's industrial structure adjustment. On one hand, Shanghai will vigorously develop those key products with advanced technology and low energy and material consumption, improve resource utilization, increase market supply and export earnings, and appropriately develop a number of raw material industries related to key products, such as basic chemical raw materials and scarce steel varieties, non-ferrous metal materials, etc. On the other hand, it will resolutely compress and eliminate those products with high energy consumption, high material consumption, low efficiency, and serious pollution. Starting from January 3 this year, the municipal government has authorized the Planning Commission and the Economic Commission to analyze and rank one industry at a time in conjunction with various industrial bureaus. Currently, more than 200 products have been identified for priority development, more than 200 technical renovation projects have been identified for priority guarantee, and more than 100 products have been identified for restriction and elimination, as well as a number of enterprises to be closed and restructured. The first batch of 126 restricted and controlled products and projects include 75 products designated by the state and restricted from new construction, such as refrigerators, air conditioners, VCRs, microwave ovens, and electromagnetic stoves, and 51 products whose production capacity is restricted and gradually eliminated, such as wooden clock cases, 120 cameras, ordinary sewing machines, and ordinary lathes.

In conjunction with these catalogs, the municipal government requires financial, tax, banking, foreign exchange, and labor management departments to strictly arrange the flow of production factors in accordance with the adjustment direction. For eliminated and restricted products, the municipal government will implement the "penalize old and subsidize new" method, that is, within the prescribed elimination period, an additional tax will be levied on old products. The tax rate will increase year by year, making the profit decrease year by year until it is unprofitable or even at a loss, in order to achieve the goal of forced elimination. The additional tax collected will be returned to the enterprises that introduce new products as a new product development fund. Elimination of products is not allowed to be transferred to township enterprises; 126 restricted and controlled products are not allowed to be listed as technical renovation projects and loan funds.

Some industrial departments and investment institutions, starting from the overall adjustment of the city, use "down" to protect "up" and "pressure" to protect "adjustment," and have put forward their own plans. The Economic Commission system plans to reduce the scale of technical renovation investment completed last year by half, and has already reduced 387 items totaling 700 million yuan in investment. Shanghai's projects utilizing foreign loans have also cut 49 items totaling 247 million U.S. dollars in processing industry investment. By the end of last year, the Second Light Industry Bureau had 12 disadvantaged enterprises merged or transferred for compensation, and this year has identified 100 enterprises with outdated product structures, unable to bear the impact of raw material price increases, and on the verge of loss. These enterprises, which account for about 1/5 of the entire industry, will be gradually closed and restructured over the next four years to promote the rapid formation of scale advantages for some emerging industries.

### 上海产业结构调整全面启动  首批控制技改投资、限制增加生产能力的产品目录已公布

　　上海产业结构调整全面启动    
    首批控制技改投资、限制增加生产能力的产品目录已公布
    新华社上海电  （记者陈雅妮）“不痛苦、不牺牲就没有调整”。按照市政府领导同志这一指导思想，上海市的产业结构调整工作正在全面启动。目前，第一批１２６种“控制技术改造投资、限制增加生产能力”的工业产品目录已公布下达。
    调整产业结构是上海求生存求发展的根本出路，这个问题在几年前就明确提出来了。但由于上海的产品有销路，企业有效益，技术有优势，一些部门和企业反而对结构调整缺乏紧迫感。在当前资金、能源、原材料、外汇等全面紧缺的形势下，上海市政府为保持经济的长期稳定协调发展，决定今明两年在结构调整上动真功夫，在某些局部“伤筋动骨”，以全面理顺产业关系。
    “资源、效益”是上海产业结构调整的两大“轴心”。一方面，上海将大力发展那些工艺技术先进而能源、物资消耗低的重点产品，提高资源利用率，增加市场供给和出口创汇，同时适当发展一批与重点产品相关的原材料工业，如基础化工原料和紧缺钢材品种、有色金属材料等；另一方面将对那些高能耗、高物耗、低效益、污染严重的产品，坚决予以压缩和淘汰。从今年１月３日起，市政府已授权计委和经委，分别会同各工业局，一个行业一个行业地分析排队。目前已经排出优先发展的产品２００余种，优先保证的技术改造项目２００余项，同时排出１００多种限制、淘汰产品和一批关停并转企业。第一批出台的１２６种限控产品和项目中，包括国家定点和限制新布点的产品７５种，如电冰箱、空调机、录相机、微波炉、电磁灶等，限制增加生产能力和逐步淘汰的产品５１种，如木壳摆钟、１２０照相机、普通家用缝纫机、普通车床等。
    与这些目录配套，市政府要求财政、税务、银行、外汇、劳动等综合管理部门严格按调整方向安排生产要素的流向。对于淘汰、限制产品，市政府将推行“罚老补新”办法，即在规定淘汰的期限内，征收老产品附加税。税率逐年递增，使其利润逐年递减，直至无利甚至亏损，以达到强制淘汰的目的。征收的附加税，作为新产品开发基金，返回给上新品的企业。淘汰产品一律不得向乡镇企业转移；１２６种限控产品，不得列技改项目和资金贷款。
    一些工业部门和投资机构从全市调整的大局出发，以“下”保“上”，以“压”保“调”，纷纷拿出自己的盘子。市经委系统计划在去年完成的技改投资基础上，压减一半规模，目前已经压缩了３８７项共７亿元投资。上海利用国外贷款的建设项目，也一次砍掉了４９项共计２．４７亿美元的加工工业投资。市二轻局去年底以前已有１２家劣势企业被兼并或有偿转让，今年又排出１００家产品结构老化、无力承受原材料提价冲击、处于亏损边缘的企业。这些约占全行业１／５的企业，将在今后四年内逐步关停并转，以促使一些新兴产业尽快形成规模优势。
