The U.S. has held its fourth contact with the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). Redman said they discussed the conflict between Israeli forces and PLO guerrillas in southern Lebanon.

The U.S. State Department spokesman Redman said today that the U.S. had contacted the PLO regarding the clashes between Israeli troops and PLO guerrillas that took place in southern Lebanon this week.

Redman said that U.S. Ambassador to Tunisia, Robert Pelletreau, met with PLO representative in Tunisia, Hakim Barawi, on Tuesday, expressing "serious concern" over the conflict.

Redman refused to disclose the details of the U.S.-PLO contact. However, he said yesterday that this incident would have a negative impact on creating the necessary atmosphere for constructive dialogue between the U.S. and the PLO, and between the Palestinians and Israel.

This U.S.-PLO meeting is the fourth since the two sides began contact last December.

　　美国同巴解进行第四次接触
　　雷德曼说讨论了黎南部巴以冲突
    新华社华盛顿２月８日电美国国务院发言人雷德曼今天说，美国就以色列军队和巴勒斯坦解放组织游击队本周在黎巴嫩南部发生的冲突同巴解进行了接触。
    雷德曼说，美国驻突尼斯大使罗伯特·佩莱特鲁星期二会见了巴解驻突尼斯代表哈基姆·巴拉维，对冲突事件表示“严重关注”。
    雷德曼不愿透露美、巴接触的细节。但是他在昨天说，这一事件将对美、巴对话和对巴勒斯坦同以色列之间进行积极对话创造必要的气氛产生消极影响。
    这次美、巴会晤是自去年１２月双方开始接触以来的第四次。
