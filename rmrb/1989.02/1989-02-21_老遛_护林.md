Being a forest ranger is no easy task. If it weren't for "Old Patroller" having those two iron legs, the village's 3,995 trees would have been hard to protect.

Everyone in the village knows that "Old Patroller" protects the forest with his iron legs, constantly patrolling—day and night, summer and winter, rain or snow. When asked to share his forest protection experience, he would simply say, "Patrol, that's all."

After patrolling for 13 years, the trees are no longer the thin saplings they once were. The thickest ones are now as big as a child's waist. Looking at this stretch of acacia forest, about a mile and a half long, "Old Patroller" smiled with joy, his wrinkled face lighting up. Yes, he had every right to smile. His tears had long since been shed at the "Three Graves"...

The "Three Graves" are not in one place. The grave at the eastern end of the forest holds "Old Patroller's" forest protection partner—"Bean Leaf Yellow." "Bean Leaf Yellow" was a dog. On the night of November 17, 1983, "Old Patroller" sent it to the 2nd position (because the forest is long and narrow, often patrolling the east means neglecting the west, or patrolling the west means neglecting the east, so "Old Patroller" adopted a method of dividing positions, setting up guards, and having both humans and dogs on duty, with the 2nd position at the eastern end) to stand guard. That night, the wind was strong, and "Old Patroller" was patrolling the western end with a flower-necked dog when he suddenly heard "Bean Leaf Yellow" bark once. "Old Patroller" was startled, and upon listening more carefully, "Bean Leaf Yellow" did not bark again, only the sound of rustling tree branches remained. He became uneasy and headed towards the 2nd position. As he patrolled, "Old Patroller" heard a sound like a tree falling. Not good, someone was stealing trees. He shouted, "Who's there? Stop!" As he shouted, he chased after the shadow. "Stop, or I'll shoot!" he yelled at the figure ahead. "Don't shoot, Uncle, it's me." "Old Patroller" recognized him—it was the village's notorious "Big Fruit."

Oh, he understood now. That's why "Bean Leaf Yellow" only barked once and then stopped—because "Big Fruit" often came to the forest to play with "Old Patroller" and had also become familiar with "Bean Leaf Yellow," so... In a fit of anger, "Old Patroller" called "Bean Leaf Yellow" over and with a bang of his gun, shot dead this "traitor." But later, "Old Patroller" shed tears as he buried this partner who had shared five springs and autumns with him. The grave is next to the tree that "Big Fruit" had stolen...

"Old Patroller" once said, "Patrol, patrol, to prevent theft; if they come to steal openly, patrolling is useless!" This is true. On April 13 of last year, something like this happened. In broad daylight, someone came with a large saw to steal trees. "Old Patroller" saw the saw's open maw and felt like a nail had been hammered into his head. He asked the intruders, "You're holding a saw..." Before he could finish, two people laughed and said, "We're here on the orders of the village security chief to cut down two trees. The village needs them urgently."

"Security chief? On whose authority do you come to cut down my contracted trees? These trees, this forest, the village committee has all contracted them to me. I am responsible for them, and I won't let anyone touch them."

He drove away the "pawns," but the "generals" came. The village security chief came to find "Old Patroller."

"The village committee is expanding the office, urgently needing wood, so we're cutting down two trees. Why won't you agree?"

"Li Chief, didn't the village committee sign a contract with me..." "Contracts, those pieces of paper can be signed and changed. Don't worry, the village committee will cut a few trees, and we'll deduct them from the contract."

Li Chief's words were like a blunt club, hitting "Old Patroller" so hard that he stood there for a long time without moving. He sadly built graves for the two stolen trees and planted small trees next to each grave, whether to commemorate or to protest.

"Old Patroller" suppressed his smoking habit for the sake of protecting the forest, enduring it for 10 years... Someone might ask, did "Old Patroller" really not smoke even once in those 10 years? The author once privately asked "Old Patroller." He smiled and said, "No, I secretly smoked three times"—he really said that. If anyone doesn't believe it, they can go to Longguan Village, Qidu Town, Linzi District, Zibo City, Shandong Province to ask "Old Patroller."

"Old Patroller's" real name is Yu Jichun, and he is 62 years old.

　　“老遛”护林
    山东  贾晓东  边勇
    当护林官真难。要不是“老遛”有那两条铁腿，村里这３９９５棵树的小护林官，还真够他当的。
    村里人都知道，“老遛”护林靠铁腿，一个劲地遛，所以才成了“老遛”——白天遛了晚上遛，夏天遛了冬天遛，雨里遛了雪里遛。别人让他介绍护林经验，他一张嘴就是：“遛呗”。
    一遛１３年，眼前的树已不再是当年那拇指粗的树条条，粗的已赶上小孩腰了。树大了，“老遛”望着这片东西长约一里半的刺槐林，喜得老脸上开了花似地笑了。是呵，他该笑了，他的眼泪早已在“三堆坟”那里流尽了……
    “三堆坟”也并不在一块。林东头的那坟下埋着“老遛”的护林伙伴——“豆叶黄”。“豆叶黄”是只狗。１９８３年１１月１７日晚，“老遛”派它在２号位（因为林子东西狭长，往往遛东失西，或遛西失东，于是“老遛”采取分位设岗、人狗共守、对号入座的办法，设１号位，２号位……其中２号位在林东）执勤。那天下半夜，风很大，“老遛”正和花脖儿狗遛到了林西头，忽听得东面“豆叶黄”叫了一声。“老遛”先是心一惊，再细听，“豆叶黄”不叫了，只剩下一片吱吱哑哑的树枝声。他有些不放心，就朝２号位遛去。遛着遛着，“老遛”听到了一声似乎是树倒的声音。不好，有人偷树了。他大声喊：“谁？站住。”一边喊，一边追了上去。“站住，再不站住我开枪了。”他冲前面的黑影喊。“不要开枪，大伯，是我。”“老遛”认出来了，是村里有名的大果子。
    噢，他明白了，为啥刚才“豆叶黄”只叫了一声就不叫了，因为大果子常来林子里找“老遛”玩，顺便也和“豆叶黄”混熟了，所以……“老遛”一气之下，唤过“豆叶黄”，嘡地一土枪打死了这个“奸细”。可事后“老遛”流着泪，埋葬了这个和自己共度了５个春秋的护林伙伴。坟就在大果子偷砍的那棵树旁……
    “老遛”说过：“遛哇遛，防暗偷；明抢的来了，遛顶个球！”这话不假，去年４月１３日那天，就发生过这么回事，大白天有人扛着大锯来抢树了。“老遛”一见那正张着血盆大口的锯条，就像有棵钉子被一锤砸进了头里。他没好气地问来人：“你们拿着锯来……”还没等他说完，两个人就笑嘻嘻地接上，“我们奉村治安主任之命，来伐两棵树，村里正等着用呐”。
    “治安主任？他凭啥叫你们来伐我承包的树？这树、这林，村委会都包给我了，我要对它们负责，看谁敢动？”
    顶回了“小卒”，却招来了“老将”，村治安主任来找“老遛”了。
    “咱村委会扩建办公室，急等着用木料，来伐两棵树，你咋还不依？”
    “李主任，这树村委会不是和俺签过合同了吗……”
    “合同，那纸的东西能签就能改。你甭担心，村委会来伐几棵，保证从合同上给你减几棵去就是了。”
    李主任这话活像一根闷棒，打得“老遛”站在那里半天没动一动。他伤心地为那两棵被抢走的树筑起了坟，还在每个坟头边种上了小树，不知是为了纪念还是示威。
    “老遛”为了护林，硬把烟瘾往肚里憋，一直憋了１０年……有人会问，这１０年里，“老遛”他真个没再吸过一次烟吗？笔者曾私下问过“老遛”。他笑笑，说：“不，我偷着吸过三次”——他真是这么说的，谁不信，请自个来山东省淄博市临淄区齐都镇龙观村找“老遛”问问。
    “老遛”真名叫于季春，６２岁。
