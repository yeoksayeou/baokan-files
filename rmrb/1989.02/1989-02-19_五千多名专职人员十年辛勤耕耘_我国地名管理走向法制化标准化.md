		Over 5,000 Full-Time Staff Work Diligently for a Decade:
		China's Place Name Management Moves Toward Legalization and Standardization

		Xian, February 18 (Xinhua) — “No matter who it is, as long as someone goes out to handle business or participate in social activities, they cannot do without place names. People encounter place names every day, but many do not understand the significance and role of place name management work,” said Zhang Dejiang, 43, deputy minister of the Ministry of Civil Affairs, at the national place name symposium held in Xian on February 16. He called on the media to strengthen publicity and reporting to make the whole society care about place name work.

		Place name work is a science. It plays a role in people's social activities, economic life, national defense construction, international exchanges, and historical research. However, during the ten years of turmoil, the chaotic renaming of places such as “East Wind Road,” “Anti-Revision Village,” and “East Is Red Station” caused new confusion in place names.

		In 1979, the State Council issued the Interim Regulations on the Naming and Renaming of Place Names, marking the beginning of China's standardized place name work. Over the past ten years, with the support of governments at all levels, more than 5,000 full-time place name management personnel across the country have worked diligently to achieve remarkable results in China's place name work.

		— The first nationwide place name census was conducted. Through investigations of more than 5 million place names across the country, the situation and existing problems were identified, creating basic conditions for the development of various place name works in the future.

		— Standardization processing was carried out on the censused place names. It was ensured that there are no duplicate names at the county level and above nationwide; no duplicate names for towns and townships within a county; no duplicate names for streets within a city; and no duplicate names for villages, towns, and townships. This brought the previously chaotic place names in China to a low level of standardization.

		— Place name archives were established at all levels. With the research and application of place name information automation, place name archive materials are increasingly playing a social role.

		— Place name dictionaries, place name lists, place name records, and place name maps were compiled. This not only filled a gap in China but also helped to promote standardized place names, avoiding issues such as multiple names for one place, multiple spellings for one name, and multiple translations for one name.

		— The “Rules for the Transliteration of Foreign Place Names into Chinese Characters” and 50 foreign language transliteration tables were formulated, and tens of thousands of foreign place name translations were approved, initially solving the chaotic situation in the transliteration of important foreign place names into Chinese characters.

		— Significant progress has been made in place name research. China actively participates in international standardization activities related to place names, strengthens international cooperation and exchanges, and also promotes the development of China's place name work.

　　五千多名专职人员十年辛勤耕耘    
    我国地名管理走向法制化标准化
    本报西安２月１８日电  记者景险峰报道：“无论何人，只要出门办事，参加社会活动，都离不开地名。人们每天接触地名，但不少人对地名管理工作的意义和作用并不了解。”４３岁的民政部副部长张德江，于１６日在西安开幕的全国关于地名的座谈会上，呼吁新闻媒介加强宣传报道，让全社会都关心地名工作。
    地名工作是一门科学。它在人们的社会活动、经济生活、国防建设、国际交往以及历史研究中发挥着作用。但在１０年动乱中，各地乱改的“东风路”、“反修村”、“东方红车站”，又使地名出现了新的混乱。
    １９７９年，国务院关于地名命名、更名的暂行规定的发布，标志着我国地名标准化工作的开始。１０年来，在各级政府的支持下，经过全国５０００多名地名专职人员的辛勤耕耘，我国地名工作取得了令人瞩目的成就。
    ——进行了首次全国范围的地名普查。通过对全国５００多万条地名的调查，摸清了情况和存在的问题，为今后开展各项地名工作创造了基本条件。
    ——对普查的地名进行了标准化处理。做到全国范围内，县和县以上地名无重名；一个县内，乡、镇无重名；一个城市，街道无重名；一个乡、镇、村庄无重名。使处于十分混乱的我国地名，达到了低层次的标准化。
    ——建立了各级地名档案。随着地名信息自动化的研究和运用，地名档案资料日益广泛地发挥其社会效益。
    ——组织编纂了地名词典、地名录、地名志和地名图等。不仅填补了我国的空白，而且有利于推广标准地名，避免了一地多名、一名多写、一名多译等。
    ——制定了《外国地名汉字译写通则》和５０种外语汉字译音表，审定了几十万条外国地名译名，初步解决了外国重要地名汉字译写中存在的混乱问题。
    ——地名学研究工作取得明显进展。我国积极参加地名国际标准化方面的活动，加强了国际间的合作和交流，也促进了我国地名工作的进展。
