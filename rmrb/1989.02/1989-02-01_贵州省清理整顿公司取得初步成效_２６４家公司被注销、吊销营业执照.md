Reuters, Guizhou: Reporters Pan Di Du and Hu Yue Ping report: In Guizhou Province, 264 companies have had their business licenses revoked or canceled during the cleanup and rectification process. Additionally, 221 companies have been downgraded, 33 companies have been merged, 163 companies have been decoupled from party and government agencies, and 1,362 party and government officials have resigned from their concurrent positions in enterprises.

Since the cleanup and rectification of companies began last November, the province has investigated and handled 306 cases of violations and illegal activities. Of these, 126 cases have been concluded, and 180 are still under investigation. Among the cases handled, 186 involved illegal gains of over 1,000 yuan, 88 involved gains of over 10,000 yuan, and 32 involved gains of over 100,000 yuan. Seven cases have been transferred to judicial authorities for handling, and 83 cases are being prepared for prosecution.

The Guizhou Province Company Cleanup and Rectification Leading Group pointed out that the next focus of the cleanup and rectification work will be on the 2,305 companies (centers) newly approved and registered in the province since the second half of 1986. Among these, purely commercial wholesale companies (centers) are the key focus, especially those at the provincial level, which should take the lead in cleaning up and rectifying.
