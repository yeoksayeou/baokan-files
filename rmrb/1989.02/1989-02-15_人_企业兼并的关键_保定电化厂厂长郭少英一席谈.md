	The Key to Enterprise Mergers: A Discussion with Guo Shaoying, Director of Baoding Electrochemical Plant
	By Cao Hongliang, Reporter for the People's Daily

	How should ideological work be conducted during enterprise mergers? Guo Shaoying has a lot to say on the subject, with a mix of bitterness and sweetness.

	Guo Shaoying is the director of Baoding Electrochemical Plant. "You have to guarantee that the wages and living conditions of the employees of the merged enterprise do not decrease," he said as soon as we met. "But if you do that, the employees of the merging enterprise will have complaints: 'Isn't this using our sweat to curry favor?'"

	Guo Shaoying is indeed a shrewd person. Despite the contradictions, these issues were still resolved smoothly. The reporter learned that Baoding Electrochemical Plant was one of the earliest to use mergers to "absorb" two other factories, and the integration was relatively successful. Apart from the rapid improvement in economic benefits, the work ethic and the quality of the workforce in the merged factories underwent significant changes in a short period. In 1987, the merged Baoding Electrochemical Plant was named an advanced enterprise in the provincial chemical industry system.

	How was this work carried out? Guo Shaoying said: "The important work after a merger is still ideological work. People's thoughts do not come from nowhere. For example, a cartoon was published in the newspaper showing a person wearing a fur coat, fur hat, and gloves in the middle of a snowstorm giving ideological guidance to another person who was only wearing an undershirt, shorts, and barefoot. How can someone accept your preaching in such a situation?"

	Baoding Electrochemical Plant integrated ideological work into practical work. In terms of personnel use and wage treatment, they treated all employees equally, regardless of whether they were from the merging or the merged enterprise, and judged them based on their contributions and abilities. The merged enterprises had talented individuals, and they promptly promoted two employees with organizational skills and technical expertise to the position of deputy workshop directors. They also rehired key workers who had been transferred from production positions back to their original positions. In this way, they implemented the principle of fair benefits and competition opportunities. Guo Shaoying said: "This is the most effective mechanism. This is called sincerity in exchange for sincerity."

	"Additionally, the living and working environment of people is also very important. People prefer to work in a clean environment rather than in a place that is harmful to their health; it is hard to imagine that workshop conditions can cultivate industrial workers suitable for modern large-scale machine production." For example, the operating room of the boiling furnace in the merged enterprise originally had a lot of dust and noise, and the workers had resistance, so they did not take their work seriously. After the merger, the factory separated the operating room from the furnace, allowing the workers to avoid the suffering of dust and noise.

　　人——企业兼并的关键    
     ——保定电化厂厂长郭少英一席谈
    本报记者  曹宏亮
    企业兼并中的思想工作该怎么做，郭少英有一肚子酸甜苦辣。
    郭少英是保定电化厂厂长。“你要保证被兼并企业职工的工资待遇不减少，生活有保证。可是，这一点做到了，兼并企业的职工有意见了：‘这不是拿我们的汗水做人情吗？’”一见面他就说开了。
    郭少英毕竟是有心计的人，尽管有矛盾，但这些矛盾还是从容解决了。记者了解到，保定电化厂是较早使用兼并手段“吃掉”两个厂的企业，“消化”得比较成功，除了经济效益很快提高以外，被兼并厂的风气、职工队伍素质在不长的时间内都有了大的转变。１９８７年，兼并后的保定电化厂被命名为省化工系统先进企业。
    这些工作是怎样进行的呢？郭少英说：“兼并以后的重要工作还是做人的工作。人的思想不是凭空产生的。比如，报纸上登过一幅漫画，在冰天雪地里，一个穿着皮大衣、戴着皮帽子、毛手套的人给另一个只穿着背心、短裤、光着脚的人做思想工作，人家能接受你的说教吗？”
    保定电化厂把思想工作贯穿到实际工作中。在人的使用和工资待遇上，他们对所有职工一视同仁，不分兼并企业与被兼并企业，一律看贡献，论能力。被兼并的企业有能人，他们就及时提拔了有组织才能和技术水平的两名职工为车间副主任，把过去调离生产岗位的骨干工重新请回原岗位作骨干使用。这样一来，就把公平的利益原则和竞争机会落实了，郭少英说：“这是最有用的机制，这叫真诚换真诚。”
    “还有，人的生活、工作环境也很重要。人都喜欢在整洁的环境中工作，而不愿在对身体有害的地方工作；很难设想作坊工作条件能培养出适合现代化机器大生产的产业工人。”例如被兼并企业的沸腾炉操作室原来粉尘多，噪音大，工人心里有抵触，工作就不负责。兼并以后，这个厂把操作室同炉子分开，使工人免受粉尘、噪音之苦。
