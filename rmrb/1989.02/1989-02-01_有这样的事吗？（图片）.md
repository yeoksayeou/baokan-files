Title: Is This Possible?

On the morning of January 3, as I passed by the Lixin Grocery Store on Beizheng Street in our city, I noticed a large pile of garbage that had been there for two days had not been removed. The public was discussing that this was garbage dumped here by the city's sanitation department on New Year's morning. The reason given was that this grocery store had not paid the garbage removal fee.

If what the public says is true, then the sanitation department's actions, which disregard the city's appearance and hygiene, are truly unacceptable. It is wrong for the store to not pay the garbage removal fee, and they should pay it. However, the sanitation department should not use this method to solve the problem.

　　有这样的事吗？
    1月3日上午，我路经我市北正街立新副食品商店，见商店门前堆放了两天的一大堆垃圾还未运走。群众议论说，这是元旦清晨，我市环卫部门倾倒在这里的，原因是这家副食店拖欠了垃圾运费。
    如果真像群众所言，环卫部门这种不顾市容，不讲卫生的恶作剧实在太不应该了。商店拖欠垃圾运费当然不对，应该补交，但环卫部门不能采取这种解决问题的方法。    江西萍乡市　乔杨
