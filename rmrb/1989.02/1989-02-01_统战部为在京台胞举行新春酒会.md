The United Front Work Department held a Spring Festival banquet for Taiwanese compatriots in Beijing.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 31st - (Reporter Chang Zheng) Last year, over 400,000 Taiwanese compatriots returned to the mainland to visit relatives and friends. The indirect trade between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait reached over $2 billion. This was mentioned by Yan Mingfu, Secretary of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee and Director of the United Front Work Department, at the Spring Festival banquet held by the United Front Work Department for Taiwanese compatriots in Beijing tonight.

Since the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress issued the "Message to Compatriots in Taiwan" on January 1, 1979, exactly ten years have passed. During this period, the relationship between the mainland and Taiwan has shifted from a severe political and military standoff to the Taiwan authorities allowing Taiwanese compatriots to return to the mainland to visit relatives. The relationship between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait has gradually eased and relaxed. The decades-long artificial closure and isolation have been broken through, and it is undeniable that exchanges between the two sides will become more frequent.

Yan Mingfu said in his speech at the banquet, "Unfortunately, the Taiwan authorities still insist on the so-called 'private, one-way, indirect' policy, which is not conducive to the further development of exchanges between the two sides and the process of peaceful reunification of the motherland." He hopes that the exchanges between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait will be two-way rather than one-way, and that Taiwan will have an equal mindset and policy. He pointed out that the mainland has not set any obstacles for Taiwanese compatriots returning to the mainland to visit relatives and friends, and has not required them to fill out forms indicating their political status. On the contrary, more and more Taiwanese compatriots are welcomed to return to the mainland without any restrictions. He hopes that in the exchanges between the two sides, there will be no artificial obstacles.

Ding Guanggen, Director of the State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office, Peng Chong, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Luo Gan, Secretary-General of the State Council, Zhou Shaozhen, Secretary-General of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, dozens of Taiwanese compatriots residing in Beijing, and responsible comrades from relevant units attended tonight's banquet.

　　统战部为在京台胞举行新春酒会
    新华社北京１月３１日电  （记者长征）去年，有４０多万台湾同胞回到大陆来探亲访友，海峡两岸的间接贸易已达２０多亿美元。这是中共中央书记处书记、统战部长阎明复今晚在统战部为在京台胞举行的新春酒会上提到的。
    自从１９７９年１月１日，全国人大常委会发表《告台湾同胞书》以来，整整十年，大陆和台湾之间由严重的政治、军事对峙，到台湾当局允许台湾同胞回大陆探亲，海峡两岸的关系日趋缓和、松动，几十年人为的封闭，隔绝状态已经被冲破，不可否认，两岸的交往将越来越频繁。
    阎明复在酒会上致词说：“令人遗憾的是，台湾当局至今仍然坚持所谓民间、单向、间接的政策，不利于两岸交往的进一步发展和祖国和平统一的进程。”他希望海峡两岸的交往是双向的而不是单向的，希望台湾有对等的胸怀和政策。他指出，对于台湾同胞回大陆探亲访友，大陆方面没有设置任何障碍，没有让台胞填写注明他们政治身份的表格，相反，欢迎越来越多的台湾同胞没有任何限制地回到大陆来。他希望，在两岸的民间交往中，不要人为地设置障碍。
    国务院台湾事务办公室主任丁关根、全国人大常委会副委员长彭冲、国务院秘书长罗干、全国政协秘书长周绍铮，在北京定居的数十位台湾同胞，以及有关单位的负责同志出席了今天晚上的酒会。
