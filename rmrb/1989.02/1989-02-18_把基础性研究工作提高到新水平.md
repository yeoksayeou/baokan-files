In accordance with the fundamental policy that "economic construction must rely on science and technology, and scientific and technological work must be oriented towards economic construction," China's scientific and technological work can be broadly divided into three levels. The first level is research and development directly serving the strategic goal of doubling the national GDP by the end of the century. This is the main battlefield of scientific and technological work. The second level is the research and development of emerging and high technologies, tracking the world's advanced technological levels, and promoting and accelerating the formation and development of new and high-tech industries. The third level is basic research (including basic research and applied basic research), whose main task is to more systematically and profoundly understand natural phenomena and laws, providing new concepts, theories, and methods for humans to transform nature. These three levels of scientific and technological work are closely coordinated and form an organic whole, which should be planned and developed in a coordinated manner.

In modern society, basic research has developed into a scientific undertaking with social scale, and its content is constantly deepening. Basic research is the cornerstone of technological progress, the backbone of economic development, the window of international exchange, and the cradle of talent cultivation. It plays a supporting role in the construction of a country's material and spiritual civilization. The strength in basic sciences is an important factor in determining a country's comprehensive national power and is also a basic condition for achieving military modernization. From the successful and tortuous paths that the world and China have taken over the past few centuries, we can clearly see that a country that cannot absorb the latest scientific ideas from the world, cannot stand at the height of world scientific achievements to observe and handle problems, and lacks scientific and technological strength, cannot achieve modernization. Therefore, while organizing the majority of scientific and technological forces to enter the main battlefield directly facing the economy, we must also strengthen support for basic research. This is the foundation for ensuring the continuous development of China's society and economy.

Since the founding of the People's Republic, especially since the reform of the scientific and technological system, China's basic research work has made significant progress. A number of research institutions and facilities focusing on basic research have been established, forming a relatively complete disciplinary system, and a team of basic researchers with a certain level has been formed, laying the foundation for China's scientific and technological development.

Since 1984, China has decided to build a number of new national key laboratories, of which 21 have been completed. Since the 1980s, the State Council has decided to borrow from the World Bank to equip universities with a batch of high-tech instruments, with over 1 billion yuan already used. During the latter part of the Seventh Five-Year Plan and the early part of the Eighth Five-Year Plan, it is planned to further increase the allocation of funds to support the establishment and operation of new key laboratories.

In recent years, China has built a number of important scientific projects and large-scale scientific facilities, including electron-positron colliders, tandem electrostatic accelerators, low-temperature nuclear heating experimental reactors, and heavy-ion accelerators, totaling 11 projects with a total investment of nearly 700 million yuan.

In a situation where the national finances are relatively tight, it is commendable to maintain such an investment scale, which reflects the government's support and expectations for scientific research work.

In recent years, the level of basic research in many fields in China has been significantly improved, and some achievements have reached or approached the world's advanced level. For example: new breakthroughs in aerospace technology and atomic energy technology, research on high-temperature superconductors, the rapid construction and realization of electron-positron collisions of the electron-positron collider, the discovery of several functional crystals such as barium borate and phosphoric arginine, the discovery of five-fold symmetry and titanium-nickel quasi-crystals, etc. Some outstanding achievements have won international awards. Many outstanding scientists have been appointed as academicians of foreign academies. There are 364 Chinese scientists holding various positions in international academic organizations. The number of papers published in major international academic journals has increased significantly since 1980, and the number of papers presented at international conferences has increased significantly since 1986.

In recent years, the management and operation mechanism of basic research has shown initial results. First, the funding system for basic research has introduced a competitive mechanism, establishing the National Natural Science Foundation and setting up science funds in more than 20 departments or regions. This has played a significant role in overcoming the drawbacks of departmental fragmentation, eating from the same big pot, and lack of vitality. The Chinese Academy of Sciences and universities have also changed the method of allocating operational funds per capita, with good results. Secondly, in recent years, a number of national key laboratories, especially those of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and universities, have been opened to domestic and international researchers. Researchers have broken through the boundaries of units and departments and begun beneficial mobility. The postdoctoral research stations established after 1985 have attracted hundreds of young scholars to carry out high-level research, with a considerable number of them returning to China after obtaining doctoral degrees abroad.

The above facts show that China's basic research work has achieved considerable results. However, there are still many problems. The funding is insufficient, the intensity of support is low, and the level and quality of work are far from meeting the needs of international scientific development and national construction, and are not commensurate with the status of a country with 1.1 billion people. We must further study and adopt effective policies and measures to ensure that China's basic research work can obtain more social support, so as to ensure its sustained development.

The scale and layout of China's basic research work should, on the one hand, be adapted to the level of national economic development, and on the other hand, respect the laws of world scientific development. For example, the focus of basic research work should be on those fields where China has already formed a certain work foundation and has the potential to quickly enter the world's forefront; fields where there are significant application prospects and where international scientific "hotspots" are rapidly emerging; and fields where China's natural conditions and resource advantages can be fully utilized. For those subjects that do not have a clear application prospect for the time being but have novel academic ideas and high scientific value, they should also be supported as much as possible, and excellent academic ideas should not be allowed to be buried. In addition, the accumulation of basic scientific data and basic information is a basic work necessary for socialist construction, which has a direct supporting role in the development of society and economy, and should be given sufficient attention.

In the future, measures should be taken in a planned and step-by-step manner to increase investment and raise the proportion of basic research in scientific and technological funding. In addition to mainly relying on state financial support, efforts should be made to seek support from all sectors of society, especially to mobilize and attract large and medium-sized enterprises and enterprise groups to invest in basic research related to their future development; and to seek to increase investment in basic research through international cooperation. The reform of the funding system should be continued, first of all, to continue to strengthen and develop the science fund system, while retaining the multi-channel support methods of operational funding and special support.

We must also take practical measures to gradually improve the treatment of researchers, change the situation where the treatment of basic researchers is lower than that of other researchers at the same level, and expand the scope of post allowances. Through various measures, better conditions should be created for their work and life.

It is necessary to regard the cultivation of young academic leaders as an urgent strategic task and to take it seriously. The development of the youth science fund should be further promoted, and the postdoctoral research stations should be well managed. Special measures should be taken to cultivate outstanding young talents.

The team of basic research should be dynamically stable, maintaining the vitality of the team, that is, maintaining a lean and relatively stable overall situation, while allowing for mobility and optimization in local areas, with people coming and going. On the one hand, continuously absorb outstanding young and middle-aged talents and those with practical experience, and on the other hand, encourage and promote some personnel to flow into the field of applied development or into interdisciplinary and marginal sciences, so that talents can be fully utilized, and basic research and technological development can form a mutually complementary and complementary situation.

We must create a good environment conducive to the development of basic research, encourage researchers to give full play to their personal creative thinking, and freely exchange academic ideas. We should not require those scientific and technological exploratory works to be constrained by market demand and economic goals, and should support and protect those pioneering research works that are temporarily not understood by people.

We should further improve the management of national key laboratories, truly open them to domestic and international researchers, limit the proportion of fixed personnel, and have visiting researchers as the majority. The directors of open laboratories should break through the boundaries of departments or units, publicly recruit, and the academic committees should also be selected from the national scope. Open laboratories should implement the director responsibility system, granting more autonomy in personnel and finance. For domestic weak fields, foreign scholars can also be invited to participate in academic committees or lead research projects. For open laboratories and research institutions mainly engaged in basic research, including independent research institutes, university research institutes (rooms), a regular evaluation system should be implemented, and the level of their stage achievements and the growth of talents should be evaluated, and the system of promotion and demotion and the measures of increasing and decreasing funds should be implemented.

We should encourage and support Chinese scientists to actively participate in international cooperation and academic exchanges by utilizing the good environment of opening up to the outside world. We should simplify the approval procedures for personnel participating in international cooperation and international conferences. The academic journals of various academic societies should gradually achieve internationalization, strengthen foreign language editing capabilities, and support scientists to publish papers in international journals. In all possible fields, the scope of international cooperation should be expanded, so that China's batch of large-scale scientific experimental equipment can become international research centers. For China's mastered technology of constructing large-scale scientific facilities, we should strive to open up to foreign countries, help other countries, especially developing countries, to build similar facilities, and the foreign exchange income obtained should still be used for research work.

Continuing to strengthen basic research is a long-term policy with significant strategic implications in China's scientific and technological work. As long as we adhere to the reform and opening-up policy, clarify the guiding ideology, and take effective measures, the potential of China's basic research work will surely be gradually released, and greater achievements will be made. For the future of the country and for the progress of Chinese civilization, let us unite and strive to elevate basic research work to a new level.

　　把基础性研究工作提高到新水平
    宋健
    遵照“经济建设必须依靠科学技术，科学技术工作必须面向经济建设”的基本方针，我国科技工作大致可分为三个层次。第一个层次是直接为到本世纪末国民生产总值翻两番的战略目标服务的研究和开发工作。这是科技工作的主战场。第二个层次是新兴技术和高技术的研究开发，跟踪世界先进技术水平，推动、促进新兴产业和高技术产业的形成与发展。第三层次是基础性研究（即基础研究和应用基础研究）工作，其主要任务是更系统、更深刻地认识自然现象和自然规律，为人类改造自然提供新的概念、理论和方法。科技工作的这三个层次，是紧密配合的有机整体，应该统筹兼顾、协调发展。
    现代社会中，基础性研究已发展成具有社会规模的科学事业，研究内容不断深化。基础性研究是技术进步的基石，经济发展的后盾，国际交流的窗口，培养人才的摇篮，对国家的物质文明和精神文明的建设具有支撑性作用。基础科学方面的实力是决定一个国家综合国力的重要因素，也是实现国防现代化的基本条件之一。从几百年来世界和中国发展所走过的成功和曲折的道路中，我们可以清楚地看到，一个不能吸取世界最新科学思想、不能站在世界科学成就的高度去观察和处理问题、缺乏科学技术实力的国家，不可能实现现代化。因此，在组织大部分科技力量投入直接面向经济的主战场的同时，必须切实加强对基础性研究的支持。这是保证我国社会、经济持续发展的基础。
    建国以来，尤其是科技体制改革以来，我国的基础性研究工作有了较大的发展。已建立了一批以基础性研究为主的科研机构和设施，基本上形成了门类比较齐全的学科体系，形成了一支具有一定水平的基础研究队伍，奠定了我国科技发展的基础。
    从１９８４年起，我国又决定建设一批新的国家重点实验室，目前已经建成２１个。８０年代以来，国务院决定向世界银行借款，给高等学校装备了一批高精尖仪器，已使用的资金超过１０亿元。“七五”计划后期到“八五”计划初期还拟继续增大拨款额度，进一步支持新的重点试验室的建立和运行。
    近年来，中国建设了包括正负电子对撞机、串列静电加速器、低温核供热实验堆、重粒子加速器等在内的一批重要科学工程和大型科学装置１１项，总投资近７亿元。
    在国家财政比较困难的情况下，能够保持这样的投资规模是难能可贵的，表明了政府对科学研究工作的支持和期望。
    最近几年，在很多领域里我国基础性研究工作水平有显著提高，有些成果已经达到或接近世界先进水平。例如：航天技术和原子能技术新的突破性进展，高临界温度超导体的研究，正负电子对撞机的高速建成并实现对撞，偏硼酸钡和磷酸精氨酸等若干功能晶体的发现，五次对称性及钛—镍准晶格的发现等。一些突出成就获得了国际奖励。不少优秀科学家被聘为国外一些科学院的院士。在国际学术组织中担任各种职务的我国科学家有３６４人，在国际重要学术刊物上发表的论文数已从１９８０年起大幅度上升，在国际会议上发表的论文数，１９８６年以后有了显著增加。
    几年来，基础研究的管理和运行机制改革已初见成效。首先是基础性研究的拨款制度引入了竞争机制，建立了国家自然科学基金会，并在２０多个部门或地方设立了科学基金。这对克服部门分割、吃大锅饭、缺乏活力等弊端，起了明显的作用。中国科学院与高等院校也变革了按人头分配事业费的办法，效果是好的。其次，最近几年，一批国家重点实验室，特别是中国科学院和高等学校的实验室，实行了对国内外开放。研究人员打破了单位和部门的界限，开始了有益的流动。１９８５年后试办的博士后流动站，已吸引数百名青年学者开展高水平的研究工作。其中有相当一部分是在国外获博士学位后回国的。
    上述事实说明，我国基础性研究工作已经取得了不小的成就。但也还存在不少问题，经费不足，资助强度低，工作水平和质量远远不能适应国际科学发展的形势和国家建设的需要，和１１亿人口的大国地位不相适应。我们必须进一步研究和采取有效的政策和措施，保证我国基础性研究工作能得到更多的社会支持，以保证它的持续发展。
    我国基础性研究工作的规模和布局，一方面要与国家经济发展水平相适应，另方面还要尊重世界科学的发展规律。例如，基础性研究工作的重点应该选择那些在我国已经形成一定的工作基础、有可能很快进入世界前沿的领域；国际上正在迅速兴起的科学“热点”、而又可能有重大应用前景的领域；能充分发挥我国自然条件和资源优势的领域。对那些虽然一时还看不清应用前景，但学术思想新颖、有较高科学价值的课题，也要尽力予以支持，决不应该让优秀的学术思想被埋没。此外，基本科学数据和基础资料的积累，是社会主义建设必需的基础性工作，对社会经济的发展有直接支撑作用，更要给予充分的重视。
    今后要有计划、有步骤地采取措施，增加投资，提高基础性研究在科技拨款中的比重。除了主要依靠国家财政支持外，要争取社会各方面的支持，特别是动员、吸引大中企业和企业集团向与自己今后发展相关的基础研究方面投资；还要争取通过国际合作增加对基础性研究的投入。要继续坚持拨款制度的改革，首先要继续加强和发展科学基金制，同时保留事业费拨款和专项支持等多渠道的资助方式。
    我们还要采取切实措施，逐步提高科研人员的待遇，改变基础研究人员比其他同级科技人员待遇低的状况，扩大岗位津贴面。通过各种措施，为他们的工作和生活创造更好些的条件。
    必须把培养年轻一代学术带头人作为一件紧迫的战略任务，认真抓好。要进一步发展青年科学基金，办好博士后流动站。对杰出的青年人才，要采取特殊措施重点培养。
    基础性研究的队伍要做到动态稳定，保持队伍的活力，即从总体上保持精干和相对稳定，从局部上应该流动，优化组合，有进有出。一方面不断吸收优秀中青年和有实践经验的人才，另一方面要鼓励和推动部分人员流向应用开发领域或流向交叉科学和边缘学科，达到人尽其才，使基础性研究与技术开发形成相互衔接、相得益彰之势。
    我们必须创造一种适宜于基础研究发展的良好环境，激励研究人员发挥个人创造性思维能力，充分自由地交流学术思想。不要求那些具有科学和技术探索性的工作受市场需求和经济目标的约束，要支持和保护那些暂时不被人们理解的开创性研究工作。
    要进一步办好国家重点实验室，真正做到对国内外开放，限制固定人员比例，客座研究人员要占多数。开放实验室的负责人要打破部门或单位的界限，公开招聘，学术委员会也要在全国范围内选任。开放实验室要实行室主任负责制，赋予更多的人、财自主权。对于国内薄弱的领域，也可聘请一些国外学者参加学术委员会或主持研究课题。对开放实验室和以基础性研究为主的科研单位，包括独立研究所，大学的研究所（室），都要实行定期评审制度，根据他们阶段成果的水平和人才成长的状况，实行升降级制度和增减经费的措施。
    应该鼓励和支持我国科学家利用对外开放的良好环境，积极参加国际合作和学术交流，要简化对参加国际合作和国际会议的人员出国审批手续。各学会的学术刊物都应逐步实现国际化，加强外文编辑能力，支持科学家在国际刊物发表论文。在所有可能的领域都要扩大国际合作范围，使我国已建成的一批大型科学试验装备成为国际性的研究中心。对我国已掌握的建造大型科学装置的技术能力，要争取对国外开放，帮助其它国家，特别是发展中国家建造同类装置，所得外汇收入，仍然用于研究工作。
    继续加强基础研究是我国科技工作中的一项长期的、具有重大战略意义的政策。只要我们坚持改革、开放的方针，明确指导思想，采取得力的措施，我国基础研究工作的潜力就一定能逐步发挥出来，从而取得更大的成就。为了国家的未来，为了中华民族的文明进步，让我们团结一致，努力奋斗，把基础性研究工作提高到新的水平。
