A two-day meeting between part of the Politburo of the Bulgarian Communist Party and representatives of various intellectual circles concluded on the evening of the 21st. Zhivkov, the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, engaged in a dialogue with representatives from various intellectual circles. They discussed the upcoming reform plans for news, publishing, culture, arts, education, and scientific research.

Zhivkov stated in his speech that he hopes the intellectual community will strengthen theoretical research and re-examine and correct certain theoretical propositions. He pointed out that the previous term "developed socialist society" is incorrect. He said, "We are actually in the primary stage of building a new society," and suggested abandoning the term "developed socialism."

Zhivkov urged the economic theory community to discuss and study issues of socialist economic theory that Marx, Engels, and Lenin had not addressed. He said that the experience of socialist countries has proven that it is not possible to artificially determine the form of socialist ownership, and the proposition that "production relations can surpass the level of productive forces" is absurd. He emphasized that the most important aspect of the current reforms is to avoid getting stuck in the old frameworks created by old regulations. He advocated for the adoption of the most advanced achievements of the scientific and technological revolution, without being constrained by whether certain experiences and achievements belong to socialist or capitalist countries.

More than 20 intellectual representatives also expressed their views on issues such as social democratization, political pluralism, and openness. They believed that Bulgaria currently lacks the social foundation for the establishment of several parties.

　　日夫科夫会晤知识界代表时说
    保加利亚正处于初级阶段
    新华社索非亚２月２２日电  历时两天的保共中央政治局部分委员同各界知识分子代表的会晤于２１日晚结束。保共中央总书记日夫科夫同各界知识分子代表进行了对话。他们讨论了将要实施的新闻、出版、文化、艺术、教育和科研改革计划。
    日夫科夫在讲话中表示，希望知识界加强理论研究，重新审查和纠正某些理论的提法。他指出，过去常说的“发达社会主义社会”的提法不对。因为“我们实际是处在建设新社会的初级阶段”，应该放弃“发达社会主义”的提法。
    日夫科夫要求经济理论界讨论和研究马克思、恩格斯和列宁都没有提出过的社会主义经济理论问题。他说，社会主义国家的经验已经证明，不能人为地规定社会主义所有制的形式，“生产关系的发展可以超越生产力水平”的提法是荒谬的。他强调，当前的各项改革措施最重要的是不能在旧规章形成的老框框里继续打转。要采用最先进的科技革命成果，不要拘泥于某些经验和成果是社会主义国家的，还是资本主义国家的。
    有２０余名知识分子代表也在会晤中就社会民主化、政治多元化和公开性等问题发表了意见。他们认为，保加利亚目前不存在成立几个党派的社会基础。
