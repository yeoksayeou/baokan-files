Over 100 officers from the Jinan Military Region recently underwent a training session where they lived as ordinary soldiers, aiming to deepen their affection for soldiers and enhance their commanding skills.

The recent training session for corps, division, brigade, and regiment commanders in the Jinan Military Region was organized according to the structure of a company. The military region's commander, political commissar, and deputy commanders served as the company commander, political instructor, and deputy company commanders, respectively. They slept in bunk beds, ate according to soldiers' rations, and followed the daily routine of a company, including morning exercises, training, duty, and labor. During the nearly two-week training, the military region's leaders strictly adhered to the rules, and the commanders of various levels started from scratch, obeying orders and regulations. Many participants reflected that joining the training was like returning to the intense training periods of the 1960s, with effective systems such as officers inspecting quarters and sentry duties, and joint activities between officers and soldiers being reinforced in their minds. They gained a clearer understanding of how to strictly manage the troops.

"Wearing the insignia of an officer should not dilute the soldier's consciousness," was a common sentiment among the trainees. Many participants mentioned in their summaries that through this practical experience of being a soldier, the concept of being an "officer" faded, and their affection for soldiers was strengthened. In the future, when considering issues, they would not only think from the leader's perspective but also more from the company and soldiers' perspectives. During the training, Lieutenant General Liang Guanglie, commander of a certain group army, frequently convened meetings with the division and regiment commanders under his command. They discussed issues such as reducing administrative expenses and increasing subsidies for company rations. The division and regiment commanders expressed their determination to take effective measures to ensure that the troops are strong and in high spirits, striving to excel in all work.

　　增强爱兵观念　提高带兵能力
    济南军区百名将校军官重过士兵生活
    新华社济南１月３１日电  （记者王志耘）济南军区１００多名将、校军官最近集中起来重过连队生活，在当普通一兵的过程中增强对士兵的感情，提高带兵能力。
    于日前结束的济南军区军、师、旅、团长集训，完全按连队编制编成。军区司令员、政治委员、副司令员分别任连长、政治指导员、副连长。他们住通铺，按战士伙食标准起火，每天出操、训练、值勤、劳动等都按连队一日生活秩序要求。在近半个月的集训中，军区领导严格要求，军、师、旅、团长们服从命令，一点一滴从头练起。许多同志反映，走进集训队就好像回到６０年代大练兵时期，干部查铺查哨、官兵同教同乐、开展谈心活动等行之有效的制度又在头脑里得到加强。对于如何从严治军，加强管理，心中有数了。
    “扛将校军衔，不能淡化兵的意识”，这是参加集训的同志的普遍感受。许多同志在总结收获时谈到，通过当兵实践，淡化了“当官”的观念，强化了对士兵的感情，今后考虑问题不仅从领导角度出发，要更多从连队和士兵的角度出发。某集团军军长梁光烈少将在集训期间多次召集所属部队的师、团长们开会，研究了压缩机关开支，增加连队伙食标准补助问题。师团长们表示要采取得力措施，保证部队兵强马壮，士气高昂，在各项工作中争上游。
