During the Spring Festival, vibrant and colorful fresh flowers have found their way into many Beijing households, bringing a touch of spring.

On February 4, which marked the beginning of spring, the flower hall at the Friendship Store outside the Gate of the Nation was filled with a variety of fresh flowers, attracting a steady stream of customers. The deputy manager of the flower hall, Wang Jihua, told the reporter that giving fresh flowers as gifts to friends and relatives has gradually become a trend. In recent days, the flower hall has been bustling with business, often selling out within an hour of opening. Most of the buyers are Chinese. To ensure a steady supply of flowers, the store not only sources from local flower shops but also airlifts flowers from cities like Guangzhou and Shanghai. In a small individual-owned flower shop in Dongdan, the fragrance of water lilies fills the air, with both potted and loose flowers for sale. Due to the good quality of the flowers, business is brisk.

It is understood that in addition to the five state-owned flower shops operated by the Beijing Floriculture Company, there are now more than 30 collectively and individually owned flower shops in Beijing.

　　京城鲜花增春意　家庭生活添情趣
    据新华社北京２月５日电　　（记者黄威）春节期间，姹紫嫣红的鲜花进入许多北京人家庭，带来了阵阵春意。
    ４日正值立春，建国门外友谊商店的鲜花厅里，摆满了各色鲜花，买花人络绎不绝。鲜花厅副经理王继华告诉记者，用鲜花作为礼品馈赠亲朋好友已逐渐成为时尚。近几日，花厅的生意十分兴旺，经常是开门后一小时鲜花便被一抢而空，购买者大多是中国人。为了保证花源，这里每天除了从本地花房进货外，还从广州、上海等地空运。在东单的一家个体小花店里，一簇簇水仙花香气沁人，有盆装的，还有散卖的。由于花质量不错，生意蛮好。
    据了解，北京除了花木公司经营的５家国营花店外，现在还有３０多家集体、个体花店。
