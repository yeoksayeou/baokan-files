A U.S. commercial airliner crashes in Portugal
144 people on board all perish

Xinhua News Agency, Lisbon, February 8th: An Independence Air Boeing 707 aircraft crashed on the afternoon of the 8th on the Portuguese island of Santa Maria in the Azores. All 137 passengers and 7 crew members on board were killed.

The Boeing 707 aircraft took off from Bergamo, Italy, in the morning and was en route to Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic, when it crashed during a technical stopover on Santa Maria Island. According to eyewitnesses, the plane caught fire and exploded after colliding with a mountain peak about 7 kilometers from the airport while attempting to land.

After receiving the crash report, the relevant Portuguese authorities immediately rushed to the scene to rescue survivors, but the wide scattering of the wreckage made the rescue efforts difficult. So far, rescue workers have only found 2 bodies. It is reported that most of the passengers who perished were Italian.

　　美一民航客机在葡萄牙坠毁
　  机上一百四十四人全部遇难
    新华社里斯本２月８日电  美国独立航空公司的一架波音７０７客机８日下午在葡萄牙亚速尔群岛的圣玛丽亚岛坠毁，机上１３７名乘客和７名机组人员全部遇难。
    这架波音７０７客机是上午从意大利贝加莫起飞前往多米尼加普拉塔港途中在圣玛丽亚岛作技术停留时失事的。据目击者说，飞机在向机场降落时，由于飞行高度太低而与距机场７公里处的一座山峰相撞起火，发生爆炸。
    葡萄牙有关方面接到空难报告后，立即赶往出事地点营救，但飞机爆炸时，残骸散落范围较大，给救援工作造成很大困难。到目前为止，救援人员只找到２具尸体。据报道，这次遇难的大部分乘客都是意大利人。（附图片）
