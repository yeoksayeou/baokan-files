The United States has completed a commercial power plant that uses cow dung as fuel.

The power plant is located 110 miles east of San Diego, California. It has an installed capacity of 17,000 kilowatts and burns 40 tons of cow dung per hour. The plant generates electricity using steam-driven turbine generators. The efficiency rate is as high as 85%, producing 15,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity per hour.

According to reports, the total construction cost of the power plant was $46 million. It can save 300,000 barrels of oil annually. If electricity is sold at 7 cents per kilowatt-hour, after deducting the cost of cow dung, the plant can generate a gross profit of $8 million per year. Additionally, the 160 tons of ash produced daily from burning cow dung can be sold as road paving material, fertilizer, and sewage absorption material.

　　美国建成用牛粪作燃料发电厂
    发电率高达百分之八十五
    新华社华盛顿电  美国建成了一座以牛粪为燃料的商用发电厂。
    这座发电厂座落在加利福尼亚州圣迭戈以东一百一十英里。它的装机容量为一万七千千瓦，每小时燃烧牛粪四十吨。由蒸汽驱动汽轮发电机机组发电。发电率高达百分之八十五，每小时可提供一万五千度电。
    据介绍，整个发电厂的建设费用为四千六百万美元，它每年可节约燃油三十万桶，如每度电售价为七美分，那么扣除牛粪的费用后，每年可获毛利八百万美元。此外，每天燃烧牛粪后产生的一百六十吨渣土还可出售，作为铺路渣、肥料和污水吸附材料。
