The 7th Plenary Session of the 9th Central Committee of the Albanian Party of Labour was held in Tirana from February 1 to 2. The plenary session made significant personnel adjustments to the Central Committee Secretariat and the Council of Ministers.

The plenary session decided to relieve Stevani and Cekliku of their duties as members of the Secretariat. Isa, the former Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior, entered the Secretariat. The Secretariat was reduced from 5 to 4 members.

The plenary session relieved Bekteshi, Isa, and Cerava of their duties as Deputy Prime Ministers. Stevani and Miska were appointed as Deputy Prime Ministers, with Stevani also serving as Minister of the Interior.

The plenary session decided to relieve the ministers of the four key economic departments of industry, energy, agriculture, and transportation of their duties. Bekteshi will concurrently serve as Minister of Industry and Energy, Cekliku will serve as Minister of Transportation, and Miska will serve as Minister of Agriculture.

This is the first major personnel change in the central leadership since Alija took power in April 1985, and it has a strong economic focus. In recent years, Alija has repeatedly criticized the poor performance of major economic departments such as industry, agriculture, energy, and transportation, which has seriously affected the overall development of the national economy. This time, the Albanian Party will further strengthen its leadership in these weak economic sectors.

　　阿党中央全会变动人事
　  变动幅度大　经济色彩浓
    新华社地拉那２月３日电  （记者李季玉）阿尔巴尼亚劳动党９届７中全会１日至２日在地拉那举行。全会对党中央书记处和部长会议作了大幅度人员调整。
    全会决定解除斯台凡尼和切利库的书记处书记职务，原部长会议副主席兼内务部长伊萨依进入书记处。书记处由５人改为４人。
    全会解除了贝克泰西、伊萨依和切拉瓦部长会议副主席职务，任命斯台凡尼和米斯卡为部长会议副主席，斯台凡尼兼任内务部长。
    全会决定解除工矿、能源、农业和交通４个重要经济主管部的部长职务，由贝克泰西兼任工矿部和能源部部长，切利库任交通部长，米斯卡任农业部长。
    这是阿利雅１９８５年４月执政以来阿中央领导层的第一次重大人事变动，具有较浓厚的经济色彩。近年来，阿利雅多次批评工农业、能源、交通等主要经济部门完成计划情况不好，严重影响了整个国民经济的发展。这次阿党将进一步加强对薄弱经济部门的领导。
