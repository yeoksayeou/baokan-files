North Korea today celebrated its first Spring Festival in over 30 years, with the entire country taking a day off.

Today, most shops in Pyongyang were closed. Citizens dressed in various traditional costumes, accompanied by the elderly and children, flocked to the city's largest department store, the First Department Store, to purchase festival gifts. Thousands of people visited various parks in the city to play and take photographs.

At the Daesong Mountain Park on the outskirts of Pyongyang, an elderly man told a reporter that the Korean people have historically celebrated the Spring Festival. However, after the armistice in 1953, this traditional festival gradually faded from memory. North Korea has decided to officially resume this traditional festival starting this year.

　　朝鲜恢复过春节
    新华社平壤2月6日电朝鲜今天全国放假一天，欢度30多年来的第一个新春佳节。
    今天，平壤市大部分商店停止营业。市民们穿着各色民族服装，扶老携幼拥向市中心最大的第一百货商店购买节日礼物。成百上千的人群在市内各公园游玩、拍照。
    在平壤郊外的大城山公园，一位老人告诉记者，朝鲜人民历史上就有过春节的习俗。但是，1953年停战后，这一传统节日被渐渐地淡忘了。朝鲜已决定从今年起正式恢复这个传统的节日。
