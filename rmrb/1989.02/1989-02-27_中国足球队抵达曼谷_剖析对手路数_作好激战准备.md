The Chinese football team, participating in the World Cup qualifying rounds, arrived in Bangkok by plane yesterday afternoon at 5 PM local time. After quickly settling in, the team members headed to the training ground for over an hour of practice, demonstrating good pre-match readiness.

Today, during a break in training, the Chinese team's coaches and players watched a video of the February 23 match between Iran and Thailand, analyzing and studying the tactical characteristics of the Thai team. Many football fans in China were surprised by Thailand's 0-3 loss to Iran at their home stadium in Bangkok, but the Thai football community remained calm. Bangkok's Chinese and English newspapers had no heated comments.

A responsible person from the Thai Football Association candidly told the Chinese football team that Thailand's loss was expected. Although the Thai football team had prepared thoroughly for the World Cup qualifying rounds, with a two-month training camp, the situation was not ideal. Currently, the quality of Thai football players has declined, and team management is poor.

He hopes that the Chinese team will play to their full potential and wishes the Chinese team success in qualifying.

In the coming days, the temperature in Bangkok is around 30°C, becoming cooler in the evenings. The match between China and Thailand is the fifth game of the fifth group in the Asian zone. The game will take place at 5:30 PM local time (7:00 PM Beijing time) on February 28.

　　中国足球队抵达曼谷
    剖析对手路数　作好激战准备
    本报曼谷２月２６日电  参加世界杯外围赛的中国足球队，昨天下午当地时间５点钟乘飞机抵曼谷。行装甫卸，队员们便赶到训练场练了一个多小时，显示出良好的临战状态。
    今天训练之余，中国队的教练和队员们观看了２月２３日伊朗队与泰国队比赛的录像，分析研究了泰国队的战术特点。对泰国队在曼谷主场以０∶３败给伊朗队，中国国内不少球迷感到吃惊，但泰国足球界却十分平静，曼谷的华文和英文报纸没有什么激烈的评论。
    泰国足协一位负责人坦诚地告诉中国足球队，泰国队的失利是意料之中的。尽管泰国足球队为参加世界杯外围赛作了充分准备，集训长达两个月，但情况并不理想。如今的泰国队球员素质下降，队伍管理不善。
    他希望中国队努力打出水平，预祝中国队出线。
    这几天，曼谷的气温约在３０℃左右，傍晚以后比较凉快。中国队与泰国队的交锋是亚洲区第五小组的第五场赛事，比赛将于２８日下午当地时间５点３０分（北京时间晚７点）进行。
