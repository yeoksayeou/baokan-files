Shanghai Jiafeng Cotton Textile Mill has collaborated with agricultural and scientific research units to jointly cultivate high-quality cotton, achieving good results. Last year, the 18 mu (approximately 1.2 hectares) of cotton fields yielded an average of 51.21 kilograms of lint per mu, with a fiber length of 35 millimeters and a fiber fineness of 6100 counts or more. Among them, one variety of high-quality cotton matches the quality of Egyptian cotton.

Shanghai Jiafeng Cotton Textile Mill is renowned for producing high-quality cotton yarn and fabric, with products exported to over 80 countries and regions worldwide. To ensure product quality, the mill is meticulous in selecting and blending raw cotton, incorporating a certain amount of imported medium-staple cotton. To save foreign exchange and cultivate varieties suitable for the mill's production needs, last year, Jiafeng Mill signed an agreement with the Jiading County Agricultural Technology Promotion Center on "Trials and Selection of High-Quality Land Cotton." The mill covered the trial expenses, while the agricultural technology promotion center was responsible for implementing the trials. In Jiading County's Wangxin Township, Zhoujing Town, 18 mu of land was used to trial 11 varieties of high-quality cotton.

　　嘉丰棉纺厂联合农科单位
    出资试种优质棉替代进口省外汇
    新华社上海２月２６日电  上海嘉丰棉纺织厂与农业、科研单位合作，联合试种优质棉花获得好效果。去年试种的１８亩棉田，平均亩产皮棉５１．２１公斤，纤维长度３５毫米，纤维细度６１００支以上，其中一种优质棉花的品质可与埃及棉媲美。
    上海嘉丰棉纺织厂素以生产优质棉纱、棉布享誉国内外，产品销往世界８０多个国家和地区。为保证产品的高质量，这家厂对原棉的选用和配比十分讲究，并加入一定数量的中绒进口棉。为了节省外汇，培育品种，使棉花适合工厂生产的需要，去年嘉丰厂与嘉定县农业局技术推广中心签订了“关于试种筛选优质陆地棉花协议”，由工厂负担试验费用，农业技术推广中心负责落实试种，在嘉定县望新乡周泾镇试种了１８亩共１１个优质品种的棉花。
