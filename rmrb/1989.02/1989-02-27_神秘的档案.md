	The Mysterious File
		Li De Min

	As constant as a shadow, appearing and disappearing, each of us (at least every cadre) has a mysterious file behind us. Inside, there are records of our names, genders, ages, places of origin, political status, rewards and punishments, family members, social relationships, and so on. We cannot look at our own files. Generally, they are locked in the safe of the personnel department of our own unit or a higher-level unit. Many people do not even know what is written in their files until they die.

	Files play a crucial role at key moments. When someone is admitted to school, enlisted in the military, joins the party, or is promoted, the file can give a green light to pass or a red light to stop. As long as it lets through those who should pass and stops those who should be stopped, no one has anything to say. However, in the eyes of many, the file seems to be an "ominous object." It has brought misfortune to many people in the past, and it still makes people uneasy today. In that abnormal era, many people's files were filled with false and unjust materials by some unscrupulous individuals. Moreover, some of these materials have not been correctly viewed to this day. For example, if someone's file records a certain "background" or has a certain "relationship," that person will be placed in a separate category; if someone's comments are added with two sentences like "low awareness of ideological struggle" and "weak revolutionary spirit," that person will also lose trust. Many people have indeed suffered from their files. Of course, there are also those who have benefited from their files. According to a report in the People's Daily, during the rectification of the party, a bloodthirsty murderer, Xu Mingde, was exposed in Qijiang County, Sichuan. During the Cultural Revolution, he commanded, planned, and personally killed 77 cadres and civilians. However, his file had no record of his crimes. He climbed up step by step with that clean file!

	These facts remind us that the files need to be cleaned up. Materials that should not have been put in should now be taken out, and materials that should have been put in but were not should now be added. In addition, how to view the file also needs to be considered. For example, the comments given during the Cultural Revolution as "problems" such as "low awareness of ideological struggle" and "weak revolutionary spirit" are actually quite good today; on the contrary, if it is written as "revolutionary hero" and "revolutionary pioneer," that would not be honorable. After all, we cannot still regard them as "heroes" and "pioneers" today! In the past, when filing, the emphasis was on "politics in command," and materials reflecting a person's cultural level, professional knowledge, and work ability were not valued. In fact, this kind of material should also be included in the file. When evaluating a person, in addition to looking at their political performance, we should also look at their professional abilities.

	Moreover, the file does not need to be so mysterious. The materials in the files of the vast majority of people do not involve state secrets and should be made public to the individuals concerned. Making them public can make people feel at ease: originally, there was nothing to be afraid of inside. After making them public, if the individual thinks that there are untrue and unjust materials inside, they can explain and request corrections. Making them public also has another advantage: it prevents some unscrupulous individuals with a bit of power from using a fragment of someone's file to intimidate or harm others. During the Cultural Revolution, there was a very effective way to persecute people, which was to "throw the file." Individuals have the right to know their own files. The file should no longer be a burden on people's backs but should be a mirror in front of them, allowing people to see their true selves.

### 神秘的档案

　　神秘的档案
    李德民
    如影随形，时隐时现，我们每个人（至少每个干部）身后都有一个神秘的档案袋子，里面记载着姓名、性别、年龄、籍贯、政治面貌、奖惩情况、家庭成员、社会关系，等等。自己的档案自己是不能看的，一般锁在本单位或上级单位人事部门的保险柜里，许多人直到死也不知道自己档案袋里到底写些什么。
    档案在关键时刻起着重要的作用，一个人在升学、参军、入党、提拔的时候，它可以亮“绿灯”放行，也可以亮“红灯”阻拦。只要它放的是该放的，拦的是该拦的，谁也无话可说。可是档案在不少人眼中似乎是个“不祥之物”，它过去曾给许多人带来不幸，今天也还使人不安。在那个不正常的年代，不少人的档案袋里曾被一些不正派的人往里面装过不真实、不公正的材料，而且有些材料至今也没有被正确看待，比如，如果谁档案上记载一条什么什么“出身”、有什么什么“关系”，谁就会被打入“另册”；如果谁的评语被加上两句“路线斗争觉悟不高、造反精神不强”，谁也就失去了信任，许多人确实吃过档案亏。当然，也有占档案便宜的，据《人民日报》报道，四川綦江县在整党中清查出一个血债累累的杀人魔王胥明德，“文革”时他指挥、策划和亲手杀害过７７名干部群众，可是他的档案中却没有一点劣迹，他是凭着那份干干净净的档案袋一步一步往上爬的！
    这些事实提醒人们，档案袋得清理清理，原来不该给人装进去的现在要给人家抽出来，原来该装进去却没有装进去的现在要补进去。另外，如何看档案也得有个讲究，比如，“文革”时作为“问题”下的评语“路线斗争觉悟不高、造反精神不强”，今天看来倒是不错的；相反，如果写上“造反英雄”、“革命闯将”，那倒不光彩了，总不能今天还当“英雄”、“闯将”看待吧！还有，过去装档案讲“政治挂帅”，对反映一个人文化水平、专业知识和工作能力的材料不太重视，其实，这方面的材料也应该进档案，看人除了看政治表现，还要看业务能力。
    此外，档案似乎也没有必要那么神秘，绝大多数人的档案材料并不涉及国家机密，应该向本人公开。公开可以使人放心：原来那里面并没有什么可怕的东西。公开之后，如果本人认为那里面有不真实、不公正的材料，能够加以说明，要求更正。公开还有一个好处，免得有些心术不正而又有点权力的人抓着人家档案里的一鳞半爪去吓唬人，坑害人，“文革”中整人有很厉害的一招，就是“抛档案”。自己的档案自己有权利了解，档案不应再是人们背上的包袱，而应是面前的镜子，使人看到真实的自己。
