	“Investment Fever” Cools Down, “Construction Boom” Weakens
	Shandong Adjusts Investment Directions According to Industrial Policies

		People's Daily reports: Correspondent Jià Jiànzhōu reports: Recently, officials from Shandong Province's planning department told our reporter about a pleasant phenomenon: This year, none of the fixed asset investment projects reported by various localities are new, and none conflict with the State Council's documents. People are beginning to align with the track of acting according to the state's industrial policies.

		According to materials provided by various localities, in 1988, Shandong Province had a total of 15,600 ongoing local construction projects, with a total investment of 44.18 billion yuan. By the end of September that year, 19.3 billion yuan had been invested, accounting for 43.7% of the total investment. Through the initial phase of rectification work, 918 projects have been suspended or slowed down, reducing investment by 2.744 billion yuan, which is 8.15% of the annual investment plan. During the rectification work, Shandong Province's various localities focused on reducing office buildings and cotton spinning projects. So far, the province has suspended or slowed down the construction of 252 office buildings, reducing investment by 820 million yuan; and suspended the construction of 830,000 cotton spinning spindles.

		In this round of rectifying ongoing projects, some difficult problems were encountered. According to relevant departments, the projects that were previously rectified and reduced were all funded by the state budget, and the difficulty was not too great. However, this rectification was carried out after the construction funds changed from being free to being paid for, especially for those projects that have already spent a large amount of investment and whose main funding sources are from public fundraising and bank loans. Due to the difficulty in resolving debt burdens, it has caused many difficulties for the rectification work. In response to this situation, the Shandong Provincial Government requires various localities to, on the one hand, firmly implement the spirit of the State Council's notice, and on the other hand, to combine actual situations to make the rectification work more detailed and considerate, to avoid mistakes as much as possible, reduce losses, and leave no major aftereffects.

　　“项目热”急剧降温　“基建风”开始减弱
    山东按产业政策调整投资方向
    本报讯  记者贾建舟报道：山东省计划部门的同志日前向记者叙说了一个可喜的现象：各地今年申报上来的固定资产投资项目中，属于新上的基本没有，与国务院文件撞车的一个也未发生。人们开始转向按国家产业政策办事的轨道。
    根据各地提供的资料，１９８８年山东省地方在建项目共有１．５６万多个，投资总额达４４１．８亿元。到当年９月底，累计完成投资１９３亿元，占投资总额的４３．７％。通过前段清理工作，现已停缓建９１８项，压缩投资２７．４４亿元，占当年投资计划的８．１５％。在清理工作中，山东省各地把楼堂馆所和棉纺项目当作压缩重点。到目前为止，全省共停缓建楼堂馆所２５２个，压缓投资８．２亿元；停建棉纺项目８３万锭。
    在这次清理在建项目的工作中，也遇到了一些棘手的问题。据有关部门介绍，前几次清理压缩下来的项目，都是国家财政拨款，难度不算太大。而这次清理是在建设资金由无偿使用改为有偿使用以后进行的，特别是那些已经花费了大量投资、资金来源又主要是靠群众集资和银行贷款的项目，因债务负担不好解决，给清理工作造成了诸多困难。针对这种情况，山东省政府要求各地一方面要坚定不移地贯彻执行国务院的通知精神，一方面要结合实际情况把清理工作做得更加细致周到，尽可能地避免失误，减少损失，不留大的后遗症。
