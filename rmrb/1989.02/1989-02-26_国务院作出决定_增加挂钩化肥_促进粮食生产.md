The State Council has decided to increase the amount of tied fertilizer to promote grain production. According to a reporter from the Commercial Department's Grain Procurement and Marketing Division, to accelerate the development of grain production, the State Council has decided that starting from 1989, both the central government and local governments will appropriately increase the amount of fertilizer tied to grain contracts.

The central government will increase the tied fertilizer amounts as follows: for every 50 kilograms of rice or soybeans, the standard amount of tied fertilizer will increase from 3 kilograms last year to 7.5 kilograms; for wheat and corn, it will increase from 3 kilograms to 5 kilograms. Each province, autonomous region, and municipality directly under the central government can, according to their own fertilizer resources, appropriately increase the amount.

The State Council requires that after determining the amount of tied fertilizer for each region, the central government's special allocation of tied fertilizer should be combined to set standards and announce them to the farmers. The fertilizer tied to the contract purchase for 1989 will continue to be supplied at last year's price.

　　国务院作出决定
    增加挂钩化肥  促进粮食生产
    据新华社北京２月２５日电  （记者陈芸）记者从商业部粮食购销司获悉，为加快粮食生产发展，国务院已决定从１９８９年起，中央和地方都将适当增加粮食合同定购挂钩化肥的数量。
    中央增加的挂钩化肥数量是：每５０公斤大米、大豆挂钩标准肥由去年的３公斤增加到７．５公斤；小麦、玉米由３公斤增加到５公斤。各省、自治区、直辖市可根据自有化肥资源情况，适当增加。
    国务院要求各地在确定了本地区的挂钩化肥数量后，连同中央专项安排的挂钩化肥一起确定标准，向农民公布。１９８９年供应的与合同定购挂钩的化肥，仍按去年的价格执行。
