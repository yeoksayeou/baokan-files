Title: Hardware and Software Are Both Important

	Urban waste disposal is a significant issue that affects traffic, air quality, water purity, and the overall ecological environment. Developed countries have already made substantial progress in addressing this problem and are now focusing on resolving the remaining challenges. However, in our country, waste is often discarded indiscriminately and piled up everywhere. Many people seem unconcerned as they watch the "garbage walls" grow higher and longer.

	To tackle the waste problem, we need both equipment and facilities to establish a processing system, as well as comprehensive planning and strict regulations to mobilize public participation. The former can be compared to the "hardware" of a computer, while the latter is akin to the "software." Both are essential. Some foreign cities prioritize "hardware" but do not neglect "software." For instance, Japan and Sweden teach waste management knowledge starting from elementary school.

	Another interesting phenomenon is that the richer a country becomes, the more it focuses on recycling and reusing waste. For example, some Western developed countries use the heat generated by incinerators to produce steam for heating, industrial electricity, or other energy sources. The *Concise Britannica Encyclopedia* notes: "The steam generating plants in Paris, Munich, and Frankfurt operate in conjunction with municipal power plants." A European parliamentarian's business card and personal stationery are made from recycled paper, which, though not perfectly smooth, embodies a valuable spirit. This attention to detail and spirit should also be considered part of the "software."

	In recent years, our cities have rapidly expanded, but waste management has been overlooked. If financial constraints can explain the lack of "hardware," then why not invest in drafting necessary regulations and gradually fostering good social ethics? Improving the "software" wouldn't cost much.

### 要“硬件”更要“软件”
为民

　　要“硬件”更要“软件”
    为民
    城市生活垃圾处理不善，会妨碍交通，污染空气，败坏水质，恶化生态环境，显然不是小事。发达国家已经初步解决了这个问题，正致力于遗留的课题。而我们这儿还在随意扔，到处堆，许多人眼看着“垃圾长城”在增高、在延伸却无紧迫感。
    解决垃圾问题，既需要设备和设施，建立起处理系统；更需要通盘规划，制定严格的规章，动员公众积极配合。前者可比作计算机的“硬件”，后者类似“软件”，两者缺一不可。国外一些城市是重视“硬件”的，但也不忽视“软件”。日本和瑞典从小学起就教授垃圾处理常识，就是例证。
    另一个饶有兴味的现象是，似乎国家越富越注意废物的回收再用或再生。比如，西方一些发达国家利用焚化厂的热量生产蒸汽，供生活取暖，工业发电或作其它能源。《简明不列颠百科全书》载：“巴黎、慕尼黑和法兰克福的蒸汽发生厂，均与市政发电厂同时运转。”某欧洲议员的名片和私人信笺用的是再生纸，纸面不甚光洁，却闪烁着一种可贵的精神。这些用心或精神也应划入“软件”。
    这几年，我国的城市迅速扩展，却忽视了垃圾处理问题。如果用资金缺乏能够解释“硬件”不足的话，那么，制定必要的规章条例，以逐步培养良好的社会公德，抓抓“软件”，又能花费几个铜板呢？
