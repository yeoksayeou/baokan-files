The leader of the Afghan Seven-Party Alliance has expressed hope for reaching an agreement with the Afghan Eight-Party Alliance on establishing a temporary institution. Iranian President Khamenei hopes for unity among Afghan guerrilla factions.

	NEW DELHI, Feb. 4 (Xinhua) -- According to the Islamic Republic News Agency, Iranian President Khamenei met with Burhanuddin Rabbani, the leader of the Afghan Seven-Party Alliance based in Pakistan, in Tehran today. Rabbani briefed Khamenei on the latest developments in Afghanistan.

	According to Tehran Radio, Rabbani hopes to reach an agreement with the Afghan Eight-Party Alliance, based in Iran, on establishing a temporary institution. This institution is planned to take over Afghanistan after the Soviet troops withdraw completely by February 15. So far, the two main factions of the Afghan resistance forces have had disagreements over the distribution of seats in the future temporary institution.

	Rabbani arrived in Tehran from Pakistan on February 3.

	TEHRAN, Feb. 5 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Khamenei spoke about the situation in Afghanistan today, stating that the current regime in Afghanistan will no longer exist after the Soviet troops withdraw in the coming days.

	Khamenei said at a press conference today, "The situation in Afghanistan is very clear. The Afghan people will soon organize a government."

	In response to a question from Xinhua, he said, "We have already contacted the relevant factions of the Afghan guerrillas and persuaded them to achieve unity."

	Regarding the possibility of amending the Iranian constitution, Khamenei acknowledged that there is an opinion that the current political system in Iran is not good, and one option is to replace it with a presidential system. Iran will hold presidential elections in August this year, and according to the constitution, Khamenei cannot run for a second term. Speaker Rafsanjani has proposed that his precondition for running in the presidential election is to implement a presidential system.

　　阿富汗七党联盟领导人表示
　　希望同阿八党联盟组建临时机构
　　哈梅内伊希望阿游击队各派统一
    新华社德黑兰２月４日电  据伊朗伊斯兰共和国通讯社今天报道，伊朗总统哈梅内伊今天在这里同总部设在巴基斯坦的阿富汗７党联盟领导人穆贾迪迪举行了会谈。穆贾迪迪向哈梅内伊介绍了阿富汗局势的最新发展。
    据德黑兰电台广播，穆贾迪迪希望同总部设在伊朗的阿富汗８党联盟就组建一个临时机构问题达成一项协议，这个临时机构计划在苏联军队２月１５日从阿富汗全部撤走后接管阿富汗。迄今，这两个阿富汗抵抗力量的主要派别在未来临时机构中的席位问题上有分歧。
    穆贾迪迪是３日从巴基斯坦抵达德黑兰的。
    新华社德黑兰２月５日电　伊朗总统哈梅内伊今天在这里谈到阿富汗局势时说，在苏联军队在未来几天内撤出阿富汗之后，阿现政权将不复存在。
    哈梅内伊在今天举行的记者招待会上说：“阿富汗的局势十分明朗，阿富汗人民很快将组织起一个政府。”
    他在回答新华社记者的提问时说，“我们已经与阿富汗游击队有关各派进行了接触，说服他们达成统一”。
    在谈到伊朗修改宪法的可能性时，哈梅内伊承认，有一种观点认为，伊朗现存政体不好，其中一种选择是用总统制政体取而代之。伊朗将于今年８月举行总统选举，根据宪法，哈梅内伊不能第二次连任。议长拉夫桑贾尼提出，他参加总统竞选的前提条件是实行总统制政体。
