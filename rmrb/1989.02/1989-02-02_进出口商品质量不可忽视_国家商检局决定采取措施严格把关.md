The quality of China's imported and exported goods has become a growing concern. According to statistics, in 1988, China inspected 722,000 batches of imported and exported goods, with a total value of over 120 billion yuan, a 45% increase from the previous year. Among these, 652,000 batches were exported goods, with 22,500 batches found to be of substandard quality, accounting for 3.46% of the inspected batches. Additionally, 70,400 batches were imported goods, with 15,000 batches found to be of substandard quality, accounting for 21.4%. Both figures have increased compared to the previous year.

This year, the State Bureau of Commodity Inspection has decided to implement multiple measures to further tighten quality control. One of these measures is to prioritize the implementation of a quality permit management system for important imported goods, particularly those related to safety, health, and environmental protection, such as household appliances and transportation vehicles.
