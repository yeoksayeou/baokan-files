The U.S. generates approximately 15 to 20 billion pounds of plastic waste annually, with less than 1% being recycled. A new technology has been developed in the U.S. that mixes different types of waste plastics to produce various products, such as fence posts and car bumpers. This new composite plastic can be nailed, screwed, cut, and planed like wood.

Darrell Morro, director of the Plastic Recycling Research Center at Traugott University, said they are researching ways to make these composite plastics into load-bearing materials. This material, unaffected by weather and insects, can be used to make excellent railway sleepers. In the future, even houses might be made of plastic.

The largest recycler of polyethylene terephthalate in the U.S., the Welman Company in Clark, New Jersey, used 800 million plastic bottles in 1988 to produce 100 million pounds of recycled plastic. Most of this was made into industrial resins, which were then used to produce fibers for carpets, mats, furniture, clothing, and thick nets for stabilizing road bases.

The company's deputy director of trade, Sabrin, said, "Our production scale is expanding, and in the near future, we may need three times as many plastic bottles. However, we have a collection problem."

Morro suggested establishing a nationwide street recycling network.

### 美研究出废塑料再生工艺

　　美研究出废塑料再生工艺
    本报讯  美国每年的垃圾中约有１５０亿至２００亿磅的塑料，得到再生利用的不到１％。现在，美国研究出的新工艺把不同的废塑料掺合在一起加工成多种产品，如篱笆桩、汽车挡板等。新的混合塑料像木材一样可以用钉子钉、用螺丝钉拧、切割和刨平。
    特拉格斯大学塑料再生研究中心主任达雷尔·莫罗说，他们正在研究使这些混合塑料成为承重材料，这种材料可以不受气候和昆虫的影响，制成极好的铁路枕木。将来的房屋甚至也可能由塑料制成。
    美国最大的聚对苯二甲酸乙酯再生厂家——新泽西州克拉克的韦尔曼公司１９８８年用了８亿个塑料瓶生产了１亿磅的再生塑料。其中大部分制成了工业树脂，再制成纤维用于制造地毯、垫子、家具、服装和稳定路基用的厚网。
    这家公司贸易部副主任萨布林说：“我们的生产规模正在扩大，在不远的将来我们可能需要用３倍多的塑料瓶。但是我们有一个收集的问题。”
    莫罗建议建立一个全国范围的街头回收网。
