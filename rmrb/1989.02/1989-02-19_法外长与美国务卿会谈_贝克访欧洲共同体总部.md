French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas today met with U.S. Secretary of State James Baker, who is visiting France. The two discussed issues related to the Western Alliance, Third World debt, and the Middle East situation.

Baker arrived in Paris today. France is the last stop on his tour of NATO's Western European member countries.

According to a statement from the French Foreign Ministry, Dumas told Baker that France has in principle agreed to hold a NATO summit in Brussels at the end of May. The summit will discuss the modernization of NATO's short-range missiles, an issue on which NATO member countries still have differences.

Dumas also briefed Baker on the recent efforts by the EEC delegation to promote the early convening of an international conference for Middle East peace during their visits to several Middle Eastern countries. He emphasized the need for all parties in Cambodia to reach an agreement.

Baker will depart Paris this afternoon to return to the U.S.

Beijing, February 18 (Wei Wai) — On the morning of the 17th, U.S. Secretary of State James Baker made his first visit to the headquarters of the European Economic Community (EEC) Commission, where he held "very beneficial initial contacts" with EEC Commission officials on issues related to East-West relations.

According to the European Press Agency, Baker first held a private meeting with Commission President Jacques Delors, followed by discussions with Delors, Vice-President Karl-Heinz Narjes, and the Commissioner responsible for Latin American relations.

During the talks, Baker introduced the new U.S. administration's views and policies on East-West relations. Delors emphasized the role of the EEC in East-West relations and the contribution of a unified European market to solving global economic problems. Narjes reiterated the EEC's commitment to a multilateral system, describing it as a "partner Europe" rather than a "fortress Europe."
