The Trade Union Law is being revised urgently
and is expected to be submitted to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for deliberation this year

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 25 (Reporters Xu Kehong, Huang Xiaonan) The All-China Federation of Trade Unions is urgently revising the Trade Union Law, aiming to submit it to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for deliberation this year, so that trade union organizations have a legal basis for protecting the legitimate rights and interests of workers.

Authoritative figures from the trade unions pointed out that the first Trade Union Law of China, formulated in the 1950s, is obviously no longer suitable for the current situation. Therefore, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions has made the revision of the Trade Union Law one of the key tasks for 1989.

This year, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, which has nearly 100 million members, will also strive to promote the process of formulating the Labor Law, focusing on drafting the Minimum Wage Guarantee Law. It will propose legislative suggestions to amend and improve the Provisional Regulations on the Handling of Labor Disputes in State-Owned Enterprises and the Provisional Measures for Unemployment Insurance for Employees of State-Owned Enterprises, and participate in the drafting and revision of regulatory documents by the State Council, such as the Regulations on the Dismissal of Employees and the Retirement of Employees, and the Regulations on the Rational Organization of Labor.

The second meeting of the Presidium of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, which concluded today, also decided to actively support workers in participating in the anti-corruption struggle and further open up the social supervision channels of the trade unions as a key task for this year's trade union work.

The meeting required that all levels of trade unions actively support workers in reporting and exposing corruption such as embezzlement and bribery; for illegal acts that infringe upon the legitimate rights and interests of workers, trade unions should accept workers' complaints; firmly protect whistleblowers, and for workers who are retaliated against for reporting, trade unions should firmly protect them and pursue the administrative and legal responsibilities of those who carry out the retaliation.

　　《工会法》正抓紧修订
    可望年内提请人大常委会审议
    新华社北京２月２５日电  （记者徐克洪、黄晓南）中华全国总工会正在抓紧修订《工会法》，力争今年内提请人大常委会审议，以使工会组织在维护职工合法权益时有法律依据。
    工会权威人士指出，于５０年代制订的中国第一个《工会法》显然已不适应当前形势的需要。因此，全国总工会把修订《工会法》作为１９８９年工作要点之一。
    今年，拥有近１亿会员的全国总工会还将努力推动制定《劳动法》的进程，重点推动《最低工资保障法》的起草工作，提出修改完善《国营企业劳动争议处理暂行条例》和《国营企业职工待业保险暂行办法》的立法建议，参与国务院关于《企业辞退职工和职工退职条例》、《合理组织劳动条例》等法规性文件的起草、修订工作。
    今天结束的全总主席团第二次会议还确定，要把积极支持职工参加反腐败斗争，进一步疏通工会的社会监督渠道作为今年工会工作的重点。
    会议要求各级工会积极支持职工举报、揭露贪污受贿等腐败现象；对于侵犯职工合法权益的不法行为，工会应接受职工投诉；坚决保护举报人，对因举报而受到打击报复的职工，工会更要坚决保护，追究施行打击报复者的行政和法律责任。
