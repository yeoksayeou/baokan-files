The Chinese Buddhist Association Tibet Branch, Lhasa City Buddhist Association, and the democratic management committees of Gandan Monastery, Drepung Monastery, Sera Monastery, and Jokhang Temple jointly decided on February 4 not to hold the Lhasa Monlam Chenmo Festival this year. Other religious activities for the Great Prayer Festival can be arranged within each temple according to the actual situation of the respective temples.

The decision states that the Lhasa Monlam Chenmo Festival is an important religious event in the Tibet Autonomous Region. This religious activity, after repeated requests from the broad masses of monks and laypeople, was officially restored in 1986 under the care of the Party and the people's government.

The decision states that regarding how to hold the Lhasa Monlam Chenmo Festival this year, the Autonomous Region People's Government convened a meeting on January 28, 1989, with the main responsible persons from the regional and municipal Buddhist associations, the three major monasteries, and the Jokhang Temple Democratic Management Committee. At the meeting, Chairman Doje Cairang of the Autonomous Region People's Government once again announced that the policy regarding the Lhasa Monlam Chenmo Festival is stable and unchanged. Future decisions on how to hold the Lhasa Monlam Chenmo Festival and in what form, as well as whether the monks of each temple will participate, will be jointly decided by the Buddhist associations and the democratic management committees of the respective temples, with the participation of the monks being entirely voluntary.

The decision emphasizes that Chairman Doje Cairang clearly stated: The Party's policy of freedom of religious belief will be firmly and consistently implemented. Normal religious activities will be protected, and the legitimate religious beliefs of the people will be guaranteed. The government will provide assistance and support for important religious activities organized by religious organizations, such as the Lhasa Monlam Chenmo Festival.

The decision announces that after repeated discussions and based on the opinions of the majority of monks, the Buddhist associations and the democratic management committees of the respective temples have decided not to hold the Lhasa Monlam Chenmo Festival this year. Regarding other religious activities for the Great Prayer Festival, each temple can arrange them within the temple according to its actual situation.

　　西藏今年不举行拉萨传昭大法会
    新华社拉萨２月５日电  （记者皮德义）中国佛教协会西藏分会、拉萨市佛教协会和甘丹寺、哲蚌寺、色拉寺、大昭寺民主管理委员会２月４日联合作出决定：不举行今年的拉萨传昭大法会。大神变节的其他佛事活动，各寺根据本寺的实际情况，可在本寺内自行安排。
    决定说，拉萨传昭大法会是西藏自治区的一项重要的佛事活动。这一佛事活动经过广大僧俗信众的一再要求，在党和人民政府的关怀下，于１９８６年正式恢复。
    决定说，关于如何举行今年的拉萨传昭大法会问题，自治区人民政府于１９８９年１月２８日召集区、市两级佛协和三大寺以及大昭寺民管会主要负责人参加的会议。在会上，自治区人民政府主席多吉才让再次宣布有关拉萨传昭大法会的政策是稳定不变的。今后如何举行拉萨传昭大法会以及采取什么形式等问题，都由佛协和各寺民管会共同协商决定，各寺的喇嘛是否参加传昭大法会，完全自愿。
    决定强调说，多吉才让主席明确表示：党的宗教信仰自由政策是要坚定不移地继续贯彻执行的，对正常的宗教活动给予保护，对于人民正当的信仰权利给予保障。由宗教团体组织的诸如拉萨传昭大法会等重要佛事活动，政府给予帮助和支持。
    决定宣布，佛协和各寺民管会经过反复研究，并根据大多数喇嘛的意见，不举行今年的拉萨传昭大法会。关于大神变节的其他佛事活动，各寺根据本寺实际情况，可在本寺内自行安排。
