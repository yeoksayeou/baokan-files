The strike wave and protests by the Albanian people in Kosovo, Yugoslavia, are continuing to expand and now cover almost the entire province. Yesterday, they put forward demands for the resignation of the Kosovo League of Communists Provincial Committee and the resignation of the President of the Central Committee of the Serbian League of Communists, Milosevic.

The strike and protest activities of the Albanian people in Kosovo were initiated by thousands of miners at the "Trepca" mine on February 20. They put forward eight political demands, including opposition to the amendment of the Constitution of the Republic of Serbia, cessation of the implementation of "erroneous policies" against the Albanian people, and the dismissal of the President of the Kosovo League of Communists Provincial Committee, R. Morina.

In the past three days, the strike has spread to nearly 40 enterprises in the autonomous province, with tens of thousands of workers participating.

The Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia held an emergency meeting on the 22nd and issued a statement calling on Albanian workers to stop the strike and protest rallies. The statement also pointed out that if the strike continues, it will be beneficial to hostile forces, especially to Albanian separatist forces, and may have serious political consequences.

The Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and the Central Committee of the Serbian League of Communists have sent a seven-member working group led by Gacich, a member of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, to Kosovo to assist in the work. However, the Albanian people have ignored the appeals and warnings issued by the leadership of the League of Communists.

Miners who have been on strike for 72 hours underground said that if their demands are not met, they will begin a hunger strike.

　　南科索沃罢工浪潮扩大
    南共联盟中央等派工作组调解   
    科索沃阿族人不理会中央警告
    新华社贝尔格莱德２月２３日电  （记者徐坤明）南斯拉夫科索沃自治省阿尔巴尼亚族人的罢工和抗议浪潮正在继续扩大，目前几乎遍及全省。昨天，他们又提出了要科索沃共盟省委主席团辞职和塞尔维亚共盟中央主席团主席米洛舍维奇辞职的要求。
    科索沃阿族人这次罢工和抗议活动是由“特雷普查”矿工上千名工人２月２０日发起的。他们提出了反对修改塞尔维亚共和国宪法、停止执行“对阿族人民的错误政策”、撤换科索沃共盟省委主席团主席拉·莫里纳等８项政治要求。
    ３天来，罢工已扩大到自治省近４０家企业，有数万工人参加。
    南共联盟中央主席团２２日召开紧急会议后发表公报，呼吁阿族工人停止罢工和抗议集会，并且指出，如继续罢工将有利于敌对势力，尤其是有利于阿尔巴尼亚分离主义势力，可能产生严重的政治后果。
    南共联盟中央和塞尔维亚共盟中央已派出以南共联盟中央主席团委员加契奇为首的７人工作小组到科索沃协助工作，但阿族人对共盟领导机构发出的呼吁和警告却置之不理。
    在矿井下已坚持罢工７２小时的矿工们表示，如果他们提出的要求再得不到满足，他们将开始绝食。
