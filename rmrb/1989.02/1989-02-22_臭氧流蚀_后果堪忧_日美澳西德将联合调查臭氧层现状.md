    Ozone Depletion: Consequences Are Grave
    Japan, U.S., Australia, and West Germany to Jointly Investigate Ozone Layer Status

    According to a report by the Soviet Union's "Science and Technology Revolution: Questions and Answers" biweekly, we have been tracking the changes in the size of the ozone "hole" over the past four years. In 1986, the ozone "hole" was smaller than in 1985, but in 1987, it rapidly expanded, not only in area but also in the extent of ozone "erosion," creating a significant region where ozone levels reached an unprecedented 125 Dobson units. Additionally, there was a small white spot in the center, recorded by the "TOMS" instrument on the American "Nimbus-7" satellite, showing ozone levels below 100 Dobson units. This year, ozone levels are at least 175 units. From this, we can naturally conclude that the size of the ozone "hole" varies periodically: in even years such as 1982, 1984, 1986, and 1988, the ozone "hole" was relatively weak. In odd years, the ozone "hole" was more pronounced and larger in scale. Within the red zone, ozone levels reached 475 Dobson units. In even years, the total ozone content in the mid-latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere was also higher.

    Over the past decade, ozone levels in the Northern Hemisphere have decreased by 4% in winter and 1% to 1.5% in summer. In some places, the total decrease over 10 years has been 2% to 3%. This trend is unfavorable for humans and the biosphere. If this trend continues, within a person's lifetime, it could reach 20%, approaching the threshold of an ecological disaster.

    From Tokyo, February 19, our correspondent Yu Qing reports: Scientists from Japan, the United States, Australia, and West Germany have decided to begin a three-year joint investigation starting in September to assess the damage to the ozone layer from the South Pole to the North Pole. This large-scale international investigation of the ozone layer is unprecedented in the world.

　　臭氧流蚀　后果堪忧
    日美澳西德将联合调查臭氧层现状
    本报讯  据苏联《科学技术革命：问题与解答》半月刊报道：在最近四年里，我们一直跟踪观察臭氧“洞”尺寸的变化。１９８６年臭氧“洞”比１９８５年小，１９８７年急剧增大，而且不仅在面积上，还在臭氧“流蚀”程度上，出现了一个相当大的区域，其臭氧含量水平达到前所未见的１２５多布森单位级。而且中心有一个小白斑，美国“雨云—７”号卫星上的“ＴＯＭＣ”装置记录下白斑中的臭氧含量不到１００多布森单位。而今年，臭氧含量至少有１７５个单位。由此自然得出一个关于臭氧“洞”尺寸变化周期性的结论：偶数年１９８２年、１９８４年、１９８６年和１９８８年臭氧“洞”表现较弱。奇数年臭氧“洞”表现亮得多，规模大得多。在红区内记录到臭氧含量高达４７５多布森单位。偶数年南半球中纬度臭氧总含量也较高。
    最近１０年来，北半球臭氧含量冬季减少４％，夏季减少１％—１．５％。有的地方１０年来总计减少了２％—３％。这一趋势对人和生物圈不利。如果保持这一速度，在一代人的一生里，这个趋势可达到２０％，接近生态灾难的起点。
    本报东京２月１９日电　记者于青报道：日本、美国、澳大利亚和西德科学家决定从９月开始，用３年时间联合调查从南极到北极臭氧层遭到破坏的现状。这种国际性大规模调查臭氧层在世界尚属首次。
