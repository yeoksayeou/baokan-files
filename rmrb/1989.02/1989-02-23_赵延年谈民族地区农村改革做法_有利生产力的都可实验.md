Vice Minister of the State Ethnic Affairs Commission Zhao Yanni said that the rural system reform in ethnic regions should focus on their unique characteristics and proceed according to the needs of developing a commodity economy. Any method that benefits the development of productive forces should be allowed for experimentation.

Zhao Yanni pointed out at the National Ethnic Affairs Commission Directors' Meeting that currently, in pastoral areas, the household contract responsibility system for both grass and livestock should be further improved, and livestock product and pastoral production material trading markets should be gradually established and perfected. In forest areas, reform should be carried out to gradually rationalize the relationship between the managing departments, local authorities, and the people. For the people's self-operated forestry, a service system should be established, unreasonable taxes and levies should be abolished, and the enthusiasm of forest farmers for afforestation and forest management should be enhanced.

Zhao Yanni said that in agricultural, pastoral, and forest areas, the emphasis should be on learning and promoting applicable scientific and technological knowledge, and on developing diversified operations. At the same time, according to the needs of production development and the wishes of the people, family or household-based family farms should be developed, and appropriate scale management should be carried out.

　　赵延年谈民族地区农村改革做法
    有利生产力的都可实验
    新华社北京２月２２日电  （记者孙勇）国家民委副主任赵延年说，民族地区的农村体制改革要抓取特点，按发展商品经济的需要进行，只要有利于生产力发展的做法，都应允许实验。
    赵延年在全国民委主任会议上指出，当前在牧区应继续完善家庭草畜双承包制，逐步建立健全畜产品和牧业生产资料交易市场。林区应通过改革，逐步理顺主管部门同地方和群众的利益关系；对群众自营的林业，要健全服务系统，取消不合理的苛捐杂税，提高林农的造林营林积极性。
    赵延年说，农区、牧区、林区都应强调学习推广适用的科学技术，开展多种经营。同时，按照生产发展的需要和群众意愿，发展家庭或一户为主自动组合的家庭农林牧场，开展适度的规模经营。
