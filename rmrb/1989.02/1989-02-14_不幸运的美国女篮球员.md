Basketball is a sport that is highly popular among American sports enthusiasts. Especially in the winter, it is as popular as American football. However, this is only true for men's basketball. Women's basketball in the United States is far less popular than men's basketball, to the extent that many female athletes have to go abroad to play.

The United States has repeatedly attempted to establish professional women's basketball teams, but none of these attempts have been successful. The reason is that women's basketball games do not attract enough spectators. Consequently, the teams' income is affected. Female athletes who are passionate about basketball have no choice but to seek opportunities in Europe. For example, Ann Donovan, the former center of the U.S. national women's basketball team, started playing in Japan in 1983. Later, she signed a contract with a cosmetics company and became the first American female basketball player to earn $100,000 a year. Recently, Italy offered her a higher transfer fee to join their team.

Last year, including the eight star players who participated in the Olympic women's basketball tournament, about 100 American female basketball players went abroad to play. Some of them found it difficult to adapt to life in a foreign country and returned to the United States. For instance, Teresa Edwards, a key player of the U.S. Olympic champion women's basketball team, returned to the University of Georgia after playing three seasons in Italy. She said she did not speak Italian and that her life there was obviously not happy.

　　不幸运的美国女篮球员
    篮球是深受美国体育爱好者欢迎的一项运动。尤其在冬季，它与橄榄球并列为最受欢迎的球类比赛。但这只是对男子篮球而言，女篮在美国的地位与男篮根本不可同日而语，以至不少巾帼好手只能出国打球。
    美国曾多次试图成立职业女子篮球队，但一次也没有成功，原因是女篮比赛吸引不到足够多的观众。这样，球队的收入便要发生问题。那些有志于篮球运动的女球员，只能去欧洲寻找自己的位置。如前美国国家女篮中锋安·多诺万从１９８３年开始在日本打球，后来又同一家化妆品公司订了合同，才成为美国首位年收入达１０万美元的篮球女将。前不久，意大利方面又要以更高的转会费将她挖去。
    去年一年，包括参加奥运会女篮比赛的８名球星在内，美国先后有约１００名女篮好手前去外国效力。其中有些人不适应外国的生活，又回到美国。如奥运会冠军美国女篮的核心人物特莱萨·埃德华，在意大利打了三个赛季后，前不久又回佐治亚大学复学。她说她不会讲意大利语，只有比赛的生活显然谈不上幸福。
