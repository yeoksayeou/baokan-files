The United Nations General Assembly and the Security Council have each passed resolutions. The Security Council has unanimously approved the United Nations Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar's proposal to send a United Nations Transition Assistance Group to Namibia. This resolution will allow the assistance group to be dispatched to Namibia in time to ensure the implementation of the United Nations plan for Namibian independence starting April 1 of this year.

This resolution was reached after more than a month of frequent consultations among the members of the Security Council, the frontline states in Africa, and some non-aligned countries, thus avoiding the danger of delaying Namibia's independence.

The 43rd session of the United Nations General Assembly today unanimously approved approximately $9.2 million for the first 12 months of the United Nations Angola Verification Mission.

This session was reconvened on February 14 at the request of United Nations Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar to raise funds for the verification mission. The mission was established in December last year following an agreement among Angola, Cuba, and South Africa to peacefully resolve the issue of Southern Africa. The mission consists of 70 military observers and 38 civilian personnel, tasked with verifying the phased withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola. The mission began its work on January 3 this year.

The mission's term is 31 months (January 3, 1989 – August 2, 1991), with a total budget of approximately $19.4 million.

　　联大和安理会分别通过决议   
    向纳米比亚派驻援助团     
    批准安哥拉核查团经费
    本报联合国２月１６日电  记者刘开宸报道：联合国安理会今天一致批准联合国秘书长佩雷斯·德奎利亚尔关于联合国纳米比亚过渡时期援助团的建议。这项决议可使援助团及时派到纳米比亚，以保证关于纳米比亚独立的联合国计划于今年４月１日起开始执行。
    这项决议是经过安理会成员国、非洲前线国家和一些不结盟国家一个多月的频繁磋商后，达成一致意见的，从而避免了拖延纳米比亚独立的危险。
    本报联合国２月１６日电　记者刘开宸报道：第４３届联合国大会今天一致批准联合国安哥拉核查团头１２个月的经费约９２０万美元。
    此次大会是应联合国秘书长佩雷斯·德奎利亚尔的要求于１４日复会的，以便筹措此核查团的经费。此核查团是在安哥拉、古巴、南非就和平解决南部非洲问题达成协议后，于去年１２月成立的。核查团由７０名军事观察员和３８名文职人员组成，任务是核查古巴军队分阶段撤出安哥拉的情况。核查团已于今年１月３日开始工作。
    核查团的任务期限为３１个月（１９８９年１月３日——１９９１年８月２日），经费总额约为１９４０万美元。
