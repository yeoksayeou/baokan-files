The ancient city of Taining in the northwestern mountains of Fujian Province is a genuine "Ming city" that requires no embellishment. In 1983, experts from the Architecture Department of Tianjin University and the Fujian Provincial Museum conducted on-site inspections of a batch of old-style houses in the city, confirming that these are one of the rare and relatively well-preserved groups of Ming Dynasty civilian buildings in southern China, totaling 3 large areas and over 100 buildings. All are brick, stone, and wood structures, built in the style of Ming Dynasty ancestral halls.

Taining County has a long history, with people living there over 4,000 years ago. It is known as an "ancient town of the Han and Tang dynasties" and a "famous city of the Two Song dynasties." It flourished during the Ming Dynasty.

Upon arriving at the eastern side of the city, at Futan Lane, one can see a winding ancient alley, preserving the cobblestone and massive stone-paved roads from over 400 years ago, adorned with various patterns. The sides are fortified with long granite stones, and drainage ditches are set up. The closely packed civilian residences are connected by such alleys, creating a picturesque and orderly scene.

Walking through the market, upon entering the residential alleys, tourists will be captivated by the colorful and varied ancient house gate towers. There are square, overhanging, arched, rectangular, and saddle-shaped gate towers, with some narrow enough for only one person to pass through, while others are wide enough for horses and carriages. The attached buildings at the entrances also vary greatly, with some using granite to build steps, others constructing high thresholds, and some having three to five sets of floor-to-ceiling wooden doors side by side. These truly reflect the prosperity of the construction industry during the Ming Dynasty.

Among the many Ming Dynasty buildings, the one known as the "Shangshu Di" (Residence of the Minister) stands out the most. It is the residence of Li Chunye, who served as the Minister of War during the Ming Dynasty's Tianqi era. The entire courtyard consists of five buildings arranged in a row, covering an area of over 4,500 square meters. High wind and fire walls are built around it, with the ridge in a double-eave, hip-and-gable style, covered with jars and stone slabs. Inside, there are corridors, courtyards, flower gardens, verandas, and sky wells, all paved with granite. The largest stone weighs approximately 2,000 jin (about 1,000 kilograms). The courtyard has two main gates, north and south. The north gate, built with a high stone frame, has large stone drums on either side. The south gate, built with bricks and stones, has a large stone plaque with the words "Shangshu Di" embedded above it, surrounded by carved patterns resembling brocade. Both ends of the gate towers have stone steps, with double-leafed giant doors, making the entrance imposing. The five halls are all three-tiered, known as "three halls and nine buildings." The halls are paved with square gray bricks, and the pillars are so thick that one person cannot embrace them. The roof ridges are upturned, with carved beams and painted rafters. The brackets have wood carvings, the stone bases have stone carvings, and the brick walls have brick carvings. The figures, birds, flowers, and clouds depicted are somewhat worn, but their powerful lines and clear layers still leave one in awe.

The eastern gate of the county city still preserves a section of the Ming Dynasty city wall. The city gate is built with stones, with moss growing on it, and stone steps leading directly to the stream outside the city.

　　明代古城泰宁
    杨怀荣
    闽西北山区泰宁县城是一座无需修饰的名副其实的“明城”。１９８３年，天津大学建筑系和福建省博物馆的古建筑专家，对该城的一批旧式民房进行现场鉴定，确认这是我国南方罕见的保存较完整的明代民房建筑群，共有３大片，１００余座，均为砖石木结构平房，明代的家庙格式建筑。
    泰宁县历史悠久，４０００多年前就有人群居住，素有“汉唐古镇，两宋名城”之称，到明代最为昌盛。
    来到城东面的福堂巷，可见一条曲曲折折的古街巷，保留着４００多年前用卵石、巨大条石铺成的砌有各式图案的路面，两侧用长形花岗石围固，设有排水沟。鳞次栉比的民宅就靠这样的许多街巷连贯组合起来，错落有致。
    走过街市，步入居民住宅小巷，游人会被五光十色、姿态各异的古宅门楼建筑吸引。门楼有方形的、骑楼形的、弧形的、长方形的、马鞍形的等十几种，窄的只容一人进出，宽的能走马行车。进门的附属建筑也迥然不同，有的用花岗石砌成台阶，有的筑高门槛，还有的并列三至五扇落地木门。这些真实地反映出明时建筑业的兴旺发达。
    在众多的明代建筑物中，被称作“尚书第”的宅院最为突出。它是明代天启年间任过兵部尚书李春烨的宅第。整座大院分五幢，一字排列，占地４５００多平方米，四周筑有高大的风火墙，墙脊为重檐歇山式，用缸瓦、石板压盖。入内设有甬道、庭院、花所、回廊、天井，均为花岗石铺设，最大块的大约有２０００多斤。大院分南北两大门，北门一进用条石建成的高大门框两边，置有高与人齐的大石鼓。南端通道门框用砖石建造，上嵌“尚书第”巨大石匾一块，四周雕有仿锦团花，两端门楼均设有石墩门槛，置有双开巨扉，门户森严。五幢厅堂皆为三进，即所谓“三厅九栋”，厅堂用方形灰砖铺地，根根厅柱一人难以抱合，屋脊翘角，雕梁画栋，斗拱上有木雕、石础上有石雕，砖墙上有砖雕，所塑造的人物、鸟兽、花卉、云彩，虽有些磨损，但那刚劲的线条、分明的层次，仍然令人叫绝。
    县城东门还保存着一道明代古城墙，城门以石垒，苔痕苍然，有石级直达城外溪边。
