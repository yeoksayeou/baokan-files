The Japanese weekly "Eastern Economic" published an article stating that the Asia-Pacific region will form an open economic circle.

New China News Agency, Beijing, February 13th: The Japanese weekly "Eastern Economic" published an article stating that the Asia-Pacific region will form an open economic circle.

The "Eastern Economic" weekly published a special issue on December 24th last year, titled "Five Major Trends in 1989." Six experts predicted the basic trends and characteristics of five major trends in international politics, U.S.-Japan economics, Japanese politics, industrial society, and national life.

Professor Inokuchi Takashi of Tokyo University said that there are two major trends in international politics in 1989: one is the easing of tensions between the U.S. and the Soviet Union and the resulting fluctuations; the other is the gradual rise of regionalism.

When discussing the economic status of the Asia-Pacific region, Inokuchi Takashi said: "From a long-term perspective, including the United States, this region will also form a large economic circle. However, compared to other regions, this economic circle will have the following three differences: (1) it will be open; (2) it will develop as much as possible in a multi-national form; (3) it will form a regionalism characterized by helping the economic development of other regions."

　　日本《东洋经济》周刊认为    
    亚太地区将形成开放型经济圈
    新华社北京２月１３日电  日本《东洋经济》周刊刊登的文章认为，亚洲太平洋地区将形成开放型的经济圈。
    《东洋经济》周刊去年１２月２４日一期刊出以《１９８９年五大潮流》为题的特集，由６位专家分别就国际政治、日美经济、日本政局、产业社会和国民生活等五大潮流的基本趋势和特征作了预测。
    东京大学教授猪口孝说，１９８９年的国际政治有两大潮流，一是美苏缓和紧张局势，以及由此引起的波动；二是地区主义思潮逐渐高涨。
    在谈到亚洲太平洋地区的经济地位时，猪口孝说：“从长远观点看，包括美国在内的这个地区也将形成一个大经济圈。不过与其他地区相比，这个经济圈将具有下述三点不同：（一）是开放的；（二）尽量以多国主义的形式发展；（三）将形成以帮助其他地区经济发展为特色的地区主义。”
