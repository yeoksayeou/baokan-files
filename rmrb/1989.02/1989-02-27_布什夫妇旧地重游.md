The Bush couple revisited old haunts yesterday. At 8 AM, they attended morning prayers at Chongwenmen Church. At the church entrance, they met a Chinese woman holding a little girl. Bush happily took the child and the little girl called him "Grandpa." Bush then affectionately kissed the child's cheek.

After the morning prayers, Reverend Fan Xueqing, who had baptized Bush's only daughter, Dorothy, 15 years ago, presented the Bush couple with gifts from the church: a Chinese-language Bible and a hymn book published by the Chinese Christian Church. They were also asked to bring a gift for Dorothy: a selection of hymns and a music tape of hymns. President Bush, after giving a speech, opened a large gift box wrapped in gold paper and said with a smile, "This is a big Bible." Indeed, the Bible was about 8 pages in size.

At 9 AM, Barbara Bush, dressed in a sapphire blue outfit with a silk scarf printed with purple flowers and green leaves, stepped into the grand theater of the Prince Gong Mansion, decorated in the style of the Qing imperial court. When reporters tried to follow, two guards dressed as Qing palace soldiers blocked the door. It turned out that the guests invited by Mrs. Bush were all women. Male reporters could only watch from a nearby platform. The manager of the Prince Gong Mansion told reporters that there were four small ethnic dances performed by the Beijing Song and Dance Troupe. The program was entirely selected by the wife of the U.S. Ambassador to China, Barbara Bush. On February 18, a few staff members from the U.S. Embassy came to visit. A few days later, Mrs. Bush brought the performers to inspect the venue, and the management only then knew that the First Lady of the United States was coming to visit.

At 1:37 PM, the Bush couple visited the International Club to see old friends—former tennis partners Ji Enyi, Wang Huilong, and Wang Jinling, and barbers Li Bo and Chen Zhong. At that time, both sides allowed only one reporter to be present.

Upon entering, Bush said happily, "Although I am now the president, I cannot forget my old friends. Now that I am in China, I must come to see you."

The club staff specially prepared gifts for the Bush couple: two sets of "Blue Sky" sportswear produced in Qingdao. It is said that the club staff knew Bush was quite tall and searched all over Beijing's stores but couldn't find a suitable size. Finally, they found this size 130 set at the State Sports Commission.

At 7:30 PM, more than 500 Chinese and foreign guests joined the Bush couple at the Great Wall Hotel to enjoy Texas barbecue. In his toast at the thank-you banquet, President Bush specially mentioned Chairman Deng Xiaoping's visit to the United States in 1979, saying, "One of the reasons we are holding this Texas barbecue is that Chairman Deng, during his visit to the United States, became an honorary citizen of Texas. I would like to add that he won the hearts of the American people."

It is said that tonight's dishes were all prepared by famous chefs from Texas, frozen and shipped to China, and then reheated by Chinese chefs. All beverages and tableware on the main table, which had 32 seats per row, were also shipped from the United States.

　　布什夫妇旧地重游
    本报记者  丁刚  张亮
    　　　　两本《圣经》
    昨天８时，布什夫妇来到崇文门教堂参加晨祷。在教堂门口，他们遇到了一位抱着小女孩的中国妇女。布什高兴地抱过了孩子。小女孩对着布什叫了声“爷爷”。随后，布什又亲切地吻了吻孩子的脸蛋。
    晨祷结束后，１５年前曾给布什唯一的女儿多萝茜举行过宗教洗礼的阚学卿牧师代表教堂向布什夫妇赠送了礼物：中国基督教会出版的中文本《圣经》和《赞美诗》，还请他们带给多萝茜一份礼物：《圣诗选》和唱诗音乐磁带。布什总统在致词后，一边打开一个包着金纸的大礼品盒，一边笑着说：“这是一本大《圣经》。”果然，那本《圣经》大约有８开。
    　　　　恭王府怀古
    ９时，身穿宝石蓝色服装，系着一条印着紫花绿叶纱巾的巴巴拉夫人轻步走进了按照清宫廷风格装饰的恭王府大戏楼。当记者跟上前时，两名清宫卫兵打扮的门卫挡住了大门。原来，今天来这里品茶看戏的全是为夫人请来的女客。男记者只能在旁边的台子上观看。恭王府的管理人员告诉记者，今天的演出共有４个小型民族舞蹈，由北京歌舞团表演。节目全由美国驻华大使夫人包柏漪选定。２月１８日那天，几位美国使馆的工作人员来这里参观。几天后，包柏漪夫人便带着演员们来看场地，管理人员这才知道：美国第一夫人将要来这里游览。
    　　　　不忘故人
    １３时３７分，布什夫妇来到国际俱乐部，看望了老朋友——当年的网球陪打员季恩义、王怀龙和王金岭，理发师李波和陈忠。当时，中美双方都只能有一位记者在场。
    布什一进门就高兴地说：“我现在虽然当了总统，但我不能忘记老朋友，现在我来到中国，就一定要来看看你们。”
    俱乐部的同志特意为布什夫妇准备了礼物：两套青岛生产的蓝天牌运动服。据说，俱乐部的工作人员知道布什个子比较高，跑遍了北京的商店，也没找到合适的，最后还是在国家体委才找到这套１３０厘米的运动服。
    　　　　“长城”晚宴
    １９时３０分，５００多位中外宾客在长城饭店和布什夫妇一道品尝得克萨斯烤肉。布什总统在这次答谢宴会的祝酒词中特意提到了邓小平主席１９７９年对美国的访问，他说：“我们举行得克萨斯烤肉宴的部分原因，是邓主席访问美国时成了得克萨斯州的一名荣誉公民，我要补充的是，他赢得了美国人民的心。”
    据说，今晚的菜肴全由美国得州名厨烹制，冷冻运到中国，再由中国厨师加热。全部饮料和３２个座位一排的主桌上的餐具也是由美国运来的。
