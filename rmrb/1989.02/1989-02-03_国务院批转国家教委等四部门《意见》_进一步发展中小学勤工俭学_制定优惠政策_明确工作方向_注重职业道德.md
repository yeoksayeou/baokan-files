The State Council recently approved the opinions from the State Education Commission, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Personnel, and State Taxation Administration on further developing middle and primary school work-study programs. The State Council emphasized that developing work-study programs in middle and primary schools is beneficial for fully implementing the Party's educational policies and promoting the development of the education sector. It is also beneficial for improving teachers' living and welfare conditions, fully mobilizing their enthusiasm and creativity. Various levels of people's governments and relevant departments should strengthen leadership, adhere to the principle of comprehensive planning and steady progress, and seriously organize and manage this work. They should promptly address any arising issues and pay attention to summarizing and sharing experiences to promote the further development of work-study programs.

The "Opinions on Several Issues Regarding Further Developing Middle and Primary School Work-Study Programs" propose that middle and primary schools should adopt various forms of work-study programs, tailored to local conditions, focusing on either industrial or agricultural work as appropriate. With the approval of the education authorities at or above the county level, schools can also engage in commercial and service industries, known as the tertiary sector. Schools should create conditions to develop school-run enterprises in collaboration with other schools and gradually turn them into bases for labor education for students.

The opinions require various levels of people's governments and relevant departments to formulate preferential policies and take specific measures to help middle and primary schools establish a number of work-study bases. These bases should be managed by relevant economic departments, with comprehensive arrangements for personnel, finances, materials, production, supply, and sales, providing support. In regions with conditions, upon the school's application, the local people's government can allocate a portion of land (including mountains, forests, ponds, pastures, etc.) as the school's production and operation base according to the actual situation.

The opinions stipulate that for various enterprises established by middle and primary schools through work-study programs, in addition to the original exemptions from corporate income tax and energy transportation construction funds for school-run industries and agriculture, they can also enjoy preferential tax treatments in other areas.

The opinions state that the main source of educational funds for middle and primary schools is the allocations from various levels of people's governments and multi-channel social fundraising. The fundamental purpose of middle and primary schools developing work-study programs is to develop basic education and cultivate a new generation of people with ideals, morality, culture, and discipline. The income should be used, after retaining a portion for production development, to supplement educational funds, improve school conditions, and increase collective welfare and personal rewards for teachers and students.

The opinions emphasize that the development of work-study programs in middle and primary schools should follow the spirit of the central government's rectification of the economic environment and economic order. Leadership should be strengthened, and management should be carried out seriously to ensure healthy development. All work-study activities should be conducted within the scope allowed by national laws, regulations, and policies, without damaging the image of educational work and teachers. They should not adversely affect students' learning and physical and mental health. Teachers' main task is to ensure good teaching work. Except for those assigned to work-study programs, teachers should not be encouraged to engage in second jobs, and both teachers and students are strictly prohibited from engaging in commercial activities. The development of work-study programs in middle and primary schools should start from the actual situation and proceed with caution. Various levels of education authorities and schools must not impose mandatory revenue targets. The principal's main focus should be on comprehensively improving the school's educational work, with capable personnel assigned to handle work-study programs. Teachers assigned to work-study programs can retain their teaching positions and benefits, and their work characteristics and achievements should be considered during their appointment. Organizing students to participate in work-study programs should focus on labor education and strictly follow the educational plan. In the compulsory education stage, the value created by students' labor should, in principle, be used to improve learning conditions and not directly distributed to individuals.

　　国务院批转国家教委等四部门《意见》
    进一步发展中小学勤工俭学
    制定优惠政策　明确工作方向　注重职业道德
    新华社北京２月２日电  国务院最近批转了国家教委、财政部、人事部、国家税务局《关于进一步发展中小学勤工俭学若干问题的意见》，并且指出：中小学开展勤工俭学活动，有利于全面贯彻党的教育方针，促进教育事业发展；有利于改善教师的生活、福利待遇，充分发挥他们的积极性、创造性。各级人民政府和各有关部门对这项工作要加强领导，本着统筹兼顾、积极稳妥的原则认真组织和管理，及时解决出现的问题，并注意总结交流经验，推动勤工俭学活动进一步发展。
    《关于进一步发展中小学勤工俭学若干问题的意见》提出，中小学开展勤工俭学应采取多种形式，因地制宜，宜工则工，宜农则农，有条件的经县以上教育主管部门批准，也可以开展商业、服务业等第三产业活动。应创造条件，发展学校联合经营的校办企业，并逐步发展成为对学生进行劳动教育的基地。
    《意见》要求各级人民政府和有关部门制定优惠政策和采取具体措施，帮助中小学办好一批勤工俭学基地，并将其生产经营活动纳入有关经济部门的管理范畴，在人财物、产供销等方面统筹安排，予以支持。有条件的地区，经学校申请，当地人民政府可以根据实际情况划拨一部分土地（包括山林、水塘、牧场等）作为学校的生产经营基地。
    《意见》中规定，对中小学开展勤工俭学兴办的各类企业，除按照原有规定免征校办工业、农业的所得税和能源交通重点建设基金外，还可在其他税收上给予优惠。
    《意见》中说明，中小学的教育经费主要依靠各级人民政府拨款和多渠道社会集资解决。中小学开展勤工俭学的根本目的是发展基础教育事业，培养有理想、有道德、有文化、有纪律的一代新人。所得收益，除留一部分发展生产外，其余用于补充教育经费，改善办学条件、增加师生集体福利及个人奖励。
    《意见》强调指出，对中小学开展勤工俭学活动，要按照中央关于治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序的精神，加强领导、认真管理，使其健康发展。一切勤工俭学活动，要在国家法律、法规和政策允许的范围内进行，不得有损教育工作和人民教师的形象，不得给学生的学习和身心健康带来不良影响。中小学教师的主要任务是搞好教学工作，除抽调出来从事勤工俭学工作的以外，不提倡教师个人从事第二职业，并严禁教师、学生个人经商。中小学开展勤工俭学活动，要从实际情况出发量力而行。各级教育主管部门和各学校一律不得硬性摊派创收指标。校长的主要精力应放在全面抓好学校的教育工作上，另派得力人员负责勤工俭学工作。教师被抽调从事勤工俭学工作的，可保留教师职务及待遇，并在聘任职务时，考虑他们的工作特点和实绩。组织学生参加勤工俭学，应以劳动教育为主要任务，并严格按照教育计划的安排进行。在义务教育阶段，学生劳动创造的价值，原则上用于改善学习条件，不直接分配给个人。
