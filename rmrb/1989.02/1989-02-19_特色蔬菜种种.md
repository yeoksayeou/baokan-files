Miniature Vegetables

Currently, many countries have cultivated a batch of miniature vegetables that are adorable in appearance and of excellent quality. These include tomatoes the size of grapes, pumpkins the size of a fist, and much smaller varieties of eggplants, chili peppers, and cucumbers compared to ordinary varieties, all of which have gained popularity.

Colored Vegetables

In recent years, overseas countries have successively cultivated blue potatoes, pink cauliflower, purple kohlrabi, and radishes that are red inside and white outside. Due to the limited number of colored vegetables currently available and their certain health benefits, the market demand exceeds supply.

Slimming Vegetables

“Jikang” vegetables are a high-quality variety recently cultivated in Western Europe and other countries. They are tender, yellow, soft, and white, crisp to the bite, with a slight bitter taste, and rich in calcium and vitamins B1, B2, C, and a small amount of vitamin A. Moreover, they are low in calories.

Computer-Grown Vegetables

These are vegetables produced using computer-controlled cultivation. They are not subject to seasonal restrictions, have a short production cycle, high yield, and good quality. Customers can directly select the vegetables they need from the cultivation tanks placed in sealed greenhouses.

Clean Vegetables

Also known as “pesticide-free” vegetables, some countries use greenhouses and plastic sheds, as well as soil-less cultivation methods to grow vegetables, achieving complete separation from pesticides.

　　特色蔬菜种种
    微型蔬菜目前，许多国家已培育出一批外观可爱、品质优良的微型蔬菜。其中有葡萄大的蕃茄、拳头大的南瓜和比普通品种小得多的茄子、辣椒和黄瓜等，并赢得了人们的青睐。
    彩色蔬菜　近年来，国外已先后培育出了蓝色的马铃薯、粉红色的菜花、紫色的甘芥蓝和里红外白的萝卜等。由于彩色蔬菜目前为数不多，且具有一定食疗妙用，市场供不应求。
    减肥蔬菜　“吉康菜”是西欧等国家新近培育出的一种优质蔬菜，它嫩黄软白、入口清脆、微带苦味，并含有丰富的钙及维生素Ｂ１、Ｂ２、Ｃ及少量维生素Ａ等，而且热量很低。
    电脑蔬菜　是使用电脑自动控制培植生产出来的蔬菜。不受季节限制，生产周期短，产量高，品质好，顾客需要什么蔬菜，可直接从放置在密封的温室内的培养槽中挑选。
    清洁蔬菜　又叫“无公害”蔬菜，一些国家采用温室和塑料大棚和无土栽培方法培育蔬菜，做到了完全与农药“绝交”。
