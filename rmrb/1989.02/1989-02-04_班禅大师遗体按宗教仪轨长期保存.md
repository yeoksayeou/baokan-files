The preservation of the body of Panchen Vice Chairman is currently being carried out according to religious rituals at his residence in Deqen Pu Chang, where he passed away. According to the main official of Zhashi Lumbu Temple, Chazha Living Buddha, it will still take some time to complete the preservation and then escort the body to Zhashi Lumbu Temple for worship after the preservation is completed.

The decision to preserve the body of Panchen Lama for a long time was made in response to the request of all monks and believers in Zhashi Lumbu Temple, and it is also a traditional practice for high-ranking Tibetan Buddhist monks after their passing. The bodies of the Fourth to Ninth Panchen Lamas were all handled in this religious ritual.

On the morning of January 31, the reporter paid respects to the body of Panchen Lama. In the East Hall of Deqen Pu Chang, the body of the Lama was seen sitting cross-legged with hands folded on the chest, appearing very peaceful. He was dressed in a new robe, wearing a five-crowned Buddhist hat, and his face was covered with yellow silk. Various offerings were placed on the side table, and the front table was filled with khatas. Six high monks stood on both sides to guard the body, and more than ten Tantric monks were continuously chanting scriptures and praying.

Chazha Living Buddha said that when Panchen Lama passed away, he was in the reclining Buddha posture, facing north, which is considered very auspicious according to religious teachings. After the Lama passed away, the temple's high monks immediately followed the religious rituals and traditional methods to preserve the body, using various precious medicinal waters to carefully bathe and clean the body, wrapping it with high-quality silk, changing it on time, and taking other measures to ensure the long-term preservation of the body.

Chazha Living Buddha said that in the future, the body will be further embellished, covered with gold powder, and then a grand religious ceremony will be held to escort the body of Panchen Lama from Deqen Pu Chang to Zhashi Lumbu Temple for worship, allowing monks and laypeople to pay their respects. After the completion of the stupa of the Tenth Panchen Lama, the body will finally be placed in the stupa.

　　班禅大师遗体按宗教仪轨长期保存
    新华社日喀则２月３日电　（新华社记者、中央人民广播电台记者）班禅副委员长遗体长期保存工作目前正在他圆寂的行宫德虔普彰按宗教仪轨进行。据扎什伦布寺的主要负责人恰扎活佛说，到遗体处理好后迎请到扎什伦布寺供奉还需要一段时间。
    长期保存班禅大师遗体是根据扎什伦布寺全体僧众和信教群众要求决定的，也是历世藏传佛教高僧圆寂后的传统做法，过去四世至九世班禅的遗体都是按这一宗教仪轨处理的。记者１月３１日上午曾瞻仰了班禅大师遗容，在德虔普彰的东大殿内看到大师遗体盘腿而坐，双手叠放胸前，十分安详。他穿着崭新袈裟，头戴五冠佛帽，用黄绸缎覆盖面容，在他侧面的供桌上摆满了各种供品，前方供桌摆满了哈达，有６位高僧侍立两旁守灵，十几位密宗高僧在不停地诵经祈祷。
    恰扎活佛说，班禅大师圆寂时，呈卧佛姿式，遗容朝北，按宗教教义论是非常吉祥的。大师圆寂后，我寺高僧即按宗教仪轨和传统保存遗体方法，用多种名贵药水精心沐浴，擦洗遗体，用高级绸缎缠裹遗体，按时更换，并采取其他措施等，以保证遗体能长久保存。
    恰扎活佛说，以后还要整容，涂上金粉，再举行隆重的宗教仪式，从德虔普彰将班禅大师的遗体迎请至扎什伦布寺供奉，让僧俗众人瞻仰，待十世班禅灵塔建成后，最后将遗体请入灵塔。
