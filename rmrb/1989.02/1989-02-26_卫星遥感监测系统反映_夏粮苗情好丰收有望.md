	Satellite Remote Sensing Monitoring System Reflects
	Good Winter Wheat Seedlings, Harvest Prospects Bright

	BEIJING, Feb. 25 (Xinhua) -- "According to the satellite remote sensing monitoring system, this spring the greenness in the main winter wheat producing areas of the North China Plain has increased compared to previous years, indicating that the overwintering crops are in good condition and there is a strong possibility of a bumper summer harvest," said Chen Yaobang, deputy minister of agriculture, at a press conference today.

	According to statistics from 25 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, the total area sown in autumn and winter of 1988 was over 625 million mu, of which 440 million mu were grain crops, an increase of over 60 million mu compared to the previous year. Recent investigations and analyses show that nationwide, 80% of the 379 million mu of wheat are in the first and second categories, with the area of third-category seedlings significantly lower than last year. The focus of work by local party and government departments has begun to shift towards agriculture, with various departments supporting agriculture with strong momentum, good results, and effective measures, which is a prominent feature of this spring's production. In addition, the rebound in grain acreage is also related to the stimulation of farmers' enthusiasm for planting grain by the rising market grain prices last winter and this spring.

	The biggest change this year is the shift in agriculture from years of "verbal input" to "material input." According to incomplete statistics from 14 provinces and municipalities, the provincial-level financial allocation for agricultural support this year has reached over 500 million yuan. The loans from the Agricultural Bank of China and credit cooperatives for agriculture will increase by 68.1% compared to last year. Most places have increased their foreign exchange quotas for agriculture compared to previous years. The preparation of agricultural production materials is better than the same period last year. It is estimated that during the spring plowing period, fertilizers can basically meet the demand, the supply and demand of plastic film are also roughly balanced, the accumulation of organic fertilizers has increased compared to last year, and agricultural water conservancy construction has also progressed relatively quickly.

	According to Chen Yaobang, there are still some prominent problems in the current spring production. The most urgent issue to be addressed is the supply and demand contradiction of pesticides. Due to the higher winter and spring temperatures, the overwintering base number of diseases and pests is large, and it is predicted that diseases and pests will be more prevalent this year, which should be given sufficient attention. The prices of agricultural production materials are still relatively high. Moreover, due to difficulties in funds, transportation, etc., the allocation speed is slow, and many places' fertilizers and other materials have not yet reached the hands of farmers.

### 卫星遥感监测系统反映  夏粮苗情好丰收有望

　　卫星遥感监测系统反映
    夏粮苗情好丰收有望
    本报北京２月２５日讯  记者吴长生、蒋亚平报道：“据卫星遥感监测系统反映，今春我国冬小麦主产区华北平原的绿色度比往年增加，这说明越冬作物苗情好，夏粮丰收大有希望。”农业部副部长陈耀邦今天向新闻界通报了这一情况。
    据２５个省、市、自治区统计，１９８８年秋冬种总面积为６．２５亿多亩，其中粮食作物４．４亿多亩，比上年扩大６００多万亩。最近调查分析表明，全国３．７９亿亩小麦一二类苗占８０％左右，三类苗面积明显低于去年。各地党政部门工作重点开始向农业倾斜，各部门支援农业声势大、效益好、措施得力，是今年春季生产的突出特点。此外，粮食面积出现回升，也与去冬今春上升的市场粮价刺激了农民种粮积极性有关。
    最大的变化是今年农业出现由多年的“口头投入”向“实物投入”转变的趋向，据对１４个省市的不完全统计，今年仅省级财政安排用于支农的资金达５亿多元。中国农业银行、信用社用于农业的贷款将比去年增长６８．１％。多数地方用于农业的外汇额度比往年增加。农业生产资料的准备好于去年同期，预计春耕期间化肥可基本满足需要，农膜供需也大体平衡，有机肥积造比去年增加，农田水利建设也进展较快。
    据陈耀邦介绍，目前春季生产仍存在一些较突出的问题。最需解决的是农药供需矛盾。由于冬春气温偏高，病虫越冬基数大，预测今年病虫害将偏重发生，应该引起足够重视。农用生产资料价格仍然偏高。而且因资金、运输等困难调拨速度慢，不少地区的化肥等还未到农民手里。
