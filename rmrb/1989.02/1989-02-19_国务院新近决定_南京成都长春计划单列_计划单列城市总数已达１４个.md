The State Council has recently decided that Nanjing, Chengdu, and Changchun will be separately listed in the national plan and will be granted economic management authority equivalent to that of a province. With this decision, the number of separately listed cities approved by the State Council has reached 14.

It is understood that the implementation of separate planning for these three important central cities in the East China, Southwest, and Northeast regions is aimed at better leveraging their roles in the national economy.

In the State Council's reply regarding the implementation of separate planning for these three cities, it is required that after implementing separate planning, these three cities should not reduce the state's fiscal revenue, nor should they engage in organizational upgrades or increase personnel quotas. Instead, they should strive to leverage their respective advantages and make greater contributions to socialist modernization.

　　国务院新近决定  南京成都长春计划单列    
    计划单列城市总数已达１４个
    新华社北京２月１８日电  国务院新近决定，南京、成都、长春三市在国家计划中实行单列，并赋予其相当于省一级的经济管理权限。至此经国务院批准的计划单列城市已达１４个。
    据了解，对华东、西南和东北地区的这３个重要中心城市实行计划单列，目的是为了更好地发挥它们在国民经济中的作用。
    国务院在关于这３个市实行计划单列的批复中要求，这３个市在实行计划单列后，不要因之使国家的财政收入减少，也不要因之搞机构升格、增加编制，而要努力发挥各自的优势，为社会主义现代化作出更大的贡献。
