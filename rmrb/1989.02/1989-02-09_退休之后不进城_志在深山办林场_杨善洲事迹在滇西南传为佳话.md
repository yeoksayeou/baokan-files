After retirement, he does not move to the city; his ambition lies in establishing a forest farm in the mountains. The story of Yang Shanzhou in the southwest of Yunnan has become a celebrated tale.

	Reports from New China News Agency reporter Du Kuichang and People's Daily reporter Qian Jiang: In the barren hills of Daliang Mountain in Shidian County, Yunnan Province, a 10,000-mu forest farm is beginning to show signs of lush greenery. The original secretary of the Baoshan Regional Committee, Yang Shanzhou, after retiring, did not move to the provincial capital but instead went to the barren mountains to start a forest farm from scratch. This story has recently become a celebrated tale in the southwest of Yunnan.

	Yang Shanzhou is 62 years old this year and has long served as the secretary of the Baoshan Regional Committee. In the spring of 1986, when he stepped down from his position, he was elected as a member of the Standing Committee of the Yunnan Provincial People's Congress. According to regulations, after retirement, he could move his family to Kunming. The person in charge of the Organizational Department of the Provincial Committee talked to Yang Shanzhou: "You can just go to work at the Provincial People's Congress."

	Yang Shanzhou did not agree: "I grew up in the countryside since I was young; it's better to go back to my hometown and do something."

	Do what? Yang Shanzhou did not say, because he was still thinking about it. He returned to his hometown in Shidian County and went up the barren Daliang Mountain three times. When he was young, Daliang Mountain was covered with dense forests, with flowing streams. However, after the 1950s, the forests were cut down to single trees, one spring after another dried up, one mountain after another was exposed, the greenery disappeared, and the mountain people's lives were difficult.

	After years of contemplation, Yang Shanzhou decided to return to the mountains after retirement and establish a forest farm on Daliang Mountain, allowing the barren mountains to be green again.

	In March 1988, before his retirement procedures were completed, Yang Shanzhou signed a contract with Maoguan, Jiufang, and Jiucheng Towns to manage a 20,000-mu forest farm. Then, he led 22 forestry workers and farmers to climb the 2,400-meter-high Daliang Mountain, built oilcloth houses in the mountain valley, set up a camp, and at the same time, dug a seedling field and planted 100 mu of pine seedlings. He also planted an orchard. In August, after completing his retirement procedures, he threw himself into Daliang Mountain again.

	In September 1988, a reporter rushed to Daliang Mountain and found Yang Shanzhou. The sturdy Yang Shanzhou, dressed in peasant clothes, did not accept the interview until we agreed not to write an article. Then, he talked to us about his original intention. He has a particularly deep affection for the countryside. As a Communist Party member who grew up in these mountains, he wants to do something meaningful for the people in the mountain areas.

	Now, nearly half a year has passed, and the reporter revisited Daliang Mountain, finding that the 10,000-mu young pine seedlings are growing. The county forestry bureau has just measured that the survival rate is over 90%. The once barren Daliang Mountain has begun to show a faint green and elasticity.

	Several strands of white frost have already appeared on Yang Shanzhou's temples. He is leading the young people to open up tea gardens and nurture young seedlings. His home is still at the foot of Daliang Mountain, and his wife, a peasant, takes care of the household chores, supporting her husband in living in the deep mountains to establish a forest farm.

　　退休之后不进城　志在深山办林场
　　杨善洲事迹在滇西南传为佳话
    本报讯  新华社记者杜奎昌、本报记者钱江报道：云南省施甸县大亮山荒岭中显出了绿意初浓的万亩林场。原保山地委书记杨善洲，退休后不进省城进荒山，白手起家承建林场的事，最近在滇西南传为佳话。
    杨善洲今年６２岁，长期担任保山地委书记。１９８６年春天，他退居二线时被选为云南省人大常委会委员。按规定，退休后可以举家迁入昆明。省委组织部负责人找杨善洲谈话：“你就到省人大工作吧。”
    杨善洲没有同意：“我从小生长在农村，还是回家乡干点事情好。”
    干点什么呢？杨善洲没有说，因为还在思考中。他回到家乡施甸县三上荒凉的大亮山。在他年幼的时候，大亮山森林茂密，流水潺潺，但是５０年代后，森林被伐成孤木，一个个山泉干涸，一座座山头裸露，绿色消散了，山民们生活困难。
    思索经年，杨善洲决心退休后回山乡，在大亮山办林场，让荒山重披绿装。
    １９８８年３月，退休手续还没有办完，杨善洲就与姚关、酒房、旧城三个乡签订了承包２万亩林场的合同，然后领着２２名林业职工和农民爬上海拔２４００米的大亮山，在山凹里盖起油毛毡房，扎下营盘，同时开挖苗圃，育下百亩松苗，还种下了一片果树。８月，他办完了离休手续，又一头扎进大亮山。
    １９８８年９月，记者赶到大亮山找到了杨善洲。身板硬朗，一身农民装束的杨善洲不接受采访，直到约定不写文章时，才对我们谈起他的初衷。他对农村有特别深厚的感情，作为在这片大山里成长起来的共产党员，要为山区的群众做点有意义的事。
    现在，又过去了将近半年，记者再访大亮山，发现万亩小松苗正在长大，县林业局刚刚测定，成活率９０％以上。昔日荒凉的大亮山开始有了朦胧的绿意和弹性。
    几许白霜已经染上杨善洲的两鬓，他正在领着年轻人开辟茶园，抚育幼苗。他的家就在大亮山下，仍是农民的妻子承担起家务，支持丈夫住进深山办林场。
