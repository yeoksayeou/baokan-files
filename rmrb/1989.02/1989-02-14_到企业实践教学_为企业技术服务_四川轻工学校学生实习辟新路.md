In the context of factories and enterprises implementing the contract responsibility system, many view students' internships as a burden. How can schools ensure the practical teaching segment for students under these circumstances? Sichuan Light Industry School boldly reformed its approach, integrating practical teaching with technical services and establishing horizontal collaborations with enterprises. As a result, students' internships were strengthened, factory production improved, and both parties were satisfied, complementing each other effectively.

In recent years, due to enterprises implementing the contract responsibility system, it has been difficult to accommodate students' internships. Additionally, with rising prices and insufficient educational funds, practical teaching has faced significant challenges. In this situation, the school reformed the traditional internship methods, establishing horizontal collaborations with enterprises. This change aimed to move beyond the school's previous focus on merely teaching within the classroom and instead actively provide technical services to enterprises. This approach gained the support of enterprises and integrated students' practical teaching content with technical service projects, allowing both to proceed simultaneously and solving the difficulties faced by both parties.

In the summer of 1986, the school's papermaking major pioneered a collaboration with Ya'an Papermaking Factory. During their internship, students focused on the factory's primary issues of high chlorine consumption and low paper whiteness. Under the guidance of their teachers, they first participated in production, investigating the manufacturing process and gathering firsthand data. Then, combining their professional knowledge, they analyzed the existing problems, identified the causes, and proposed solutions to improve the process. The teachers also gave technical lectures to the factory's workers based on their investigations. Through the joint efforts of teachers, students, and workers, the factory's long-standing problems were resolved in less than two months. Chlorine consumption significantly decreased, paper whiteness improved markedly, costs were reduced, and monthly profits increased by 150,000 yuan.

Through such mutual cooperation, the school not only secured opportunities for practical teaching but also often managed to save on internship expenses. In November and December of the previous year, the school's light industry analysis major interned at Dechang Sugar Factory and Miyi Sugar Factory. Teachers and students assisted the factories in repairing instruments such as the 721 spectrophotometer and photoelectric balance, and introduced methods for analyzing tank scale and limestone to the workers. For 80 students to intern for a month, only 300 yuan was spent, saving 91% of the internship fees.

During the process of horizontal collaboration, the school changed its previous approach of merely conducting internships and causing trouble for the factories. By integrating practical teaching with technical services, the school was welcomed by the factories. Many factories that hosted the students not only provided internship venues and arranged internship projects but also proactively solved issues related to students' accommodation and meals. For example, during an internship at Shouhong Stork Brand Liquor Factory, a class from the analysis major conducted soil analysis. The factory proactively paid for the students' accommodation and provided each student with an additional 8 jiao per day for living expenses.

### 到企业实践教学　为企业技术服务  四川轻工学校学生实习辟新路

　　到企业实践教学　为企业技术服务    
    四川轻工学校学生实习辟新路
    本报讯  记者马在新报道：在工厂企业实行承包经营责任制、大都将学生来厂实习视为负担的情况下，学校如何保证学生的实践教学环节？四川省轻工业学校大胆改革，使实践教学与技术服务相结合，与企业横向联合，结果学生实习加强，工厂生产改进，彼此满意，相得益彰。
    近几年，由于企业实行承包，难以接待学生实习，加上物价上涨，教育经费短缺，实践教学遇到很大困难。在这种情况下，该校改革以往的实习方式，与企业开展横向联合，改革学校光闷头教书的状况，走出校门主动为企业提供技术服务，取得企业的支持，并将学生的实践教学内容与技术服务的项目结合起来，二者同时进行，解决了双方的困难。
    １９８６年夏，该校造纸专业率先与雅安造纸厂联合。学生在实习中，围绕该厂生产中存在的氯耗高、纸张白度低的主要问题进行专题研究。在老师指导下，他们首先跟班劳动，调查生产工艺过程，掌握第一手资料。然后，结合所学专业知识，对存在问题进行分析研究，找出原因，并提出解决问题、改进工艺的方案。老师们还结合调查研究的情况，给该厂职工上技术课。经过师生、职工共同努力，不到两月，就使工厂长期存在的问题得到解决，氯耗大幅度下降，纸张白度明显提高，成本下降，每月提高效益１．５万元。
    在这样的相互合作中，学校不仅获得了实践教学的机会，还常常可以节约实习经费。去年１１月至１２月，该校轻工分析专业在德昌糖厂和米易糖厂实习，师生协助工厂修理７２１分光光度计、光电天平等仪器，并将罐垢、石灰石的分析方法介绍给职工。８０名学生实习一个月，只花了３００元，节省实习费９１％。
    在横向联合的过程中，由于学校改变了过去那种单纯实习、光给工厂添麻烦的做法，使实践教学与技术服务相结合，受到工厂的欢迎。接待他们实习的许多工厂不仅为学生提供实习场所，安排实习项目，而且主动为学生解决食宿等一系列问题。如分析专业一个班在射洪沱牌酒厂实习，进行窖泥分析，该厂主动为学生付住宿费，并给学生每人每天补助８角钱生活费。
