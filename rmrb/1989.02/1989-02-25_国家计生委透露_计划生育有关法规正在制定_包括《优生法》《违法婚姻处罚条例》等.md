The National Family Planning Commission today revealed that the commission is currently working with relevant departments to formulate several specific regulations related to family planning, such as the "Law on Eugenics," "Regulations on Penalties for Illegal Marriages," and "Measures for the Management of Family Planning for Mobile Populations," among others.

Peng Peiyun, the director of the National Family Planning Commission, stated in discussing the legal construction of family planning that as China's reforms deepen and legal construction continues to improve, if family planning work is not gradually brought under legal management, it will be unable to meet the demands of the changing situation and may even fall into a passive position.

In recent years, various regions have accelerated the pace of legal construction for family planning. Seven provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have formulated and issued local family planning regulations, while ten provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have drafted regulatory bills, which are either being prepared for submission to local people's congresses or have already been submitted for review. By the end of 1988, 16 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions had issued "Regulations on Family Planning" or "Provisions." Except for a few provinces, the current national family planning policies have been further specified and standardized through local regulations.

The ongoing national meeting of family planning commission directors proposed that regions which have already issued family planning regulations should organize leaders at all levels and the general public to thoroughly study the regulations, widely and deeply propagate them, so that everyone truly understands, comprehends, and abides by the law.

Efforts must be made to resolutely correct the erroneous tendencies of having laws but not enforcing them, and enforcing them but not strictly. Attention should be paid to the inspection and evaluation of the implementation of regulations. Those who obstruct or disrupt family planning should be dealt with seriously according to the circumstances, and those who commit crimes should be held criminally liable in accordance with the law.

　　国家计生委透露
    计划生育有关法规正在制定
    包括《优生法》《违法婚姻处罚条例》等
    新华社北京２月２４日电  （记者于长洪）国家计划生育委员会今天透露：目前，国家计生委正协同有关部门，抓紧制定一些与计划生育有关的单项法规，如《优生法》、《违法婚姻处罚条例》、《流动人口计划生育管理办法》等。
    国家计生委主任彭珮云在谈到计划生育法制建设时说，随着我国改革的日益深入和法制建设的不断完善，如果不逐步将计划生育工作纳入法制管理的轨道，将无法适应形势发展的要求，甚至会处于被动的地位。
    近年来，各地加快了计划生育法制建设的步伐。有７个省、市、自治区制定并颁布了地方计划生育法规，有１０个省、市、自治区已经起草了法规草案，正准备或已经提交地方人大常委会审议。截至１９８８年底，全国已有１６个省、市、自治区颁布了《计划生育条例》或《规定》。除个别省以外，国家现行的计划生育政策已经通过地方法规进一步具体化、规范化。
    正在举行的全国计生委主任会议提出：已经颁布计划生育法规的地方，要组织各级领导干部和广大群众认真学习法规，广泛深入地宣传法规，使大家真正做到知法、懂法、守法。
    要坚决纠正有法不依、执法不严的错误倾向，重视法规执行情况的检查和评估，对于阻碍、破坏计划生育的，要视情节严肃处理，构成犯罪的要依法追究刑事责任。
