Qin Mountain Nuclear Power Plant Hurries to Install Equipment to Ensure Grid Connection and Power Generation by the End of Next Year

    The general manager of the China National Nuclear Corporation, Jiang Xinxiong, today introduced at the corporation's work meeting that the first phase of the Qin Mountain Nuclear Power Plant and the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant have respectively entered the equipment installation and civil construction peak stages. Among these, the Qin Mountain Nuclear Power Plant will be connected to the grid and start generating power next year, thereby ending the history of the mainland of China having no nuclear power.

    The Qin Mountain Nuclear Power Plant began pouring the first bucket of concrete in March 1985. The 300,000-kilowatt first phase project has successfully completed the installation of the containment dome and the pressure vessel of the nuclear island, and the main pipeline has also begun welding, with good quality.

    The installation of the steel lining of the containment shell of the first reactor of the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant in Guangdong has exceeded 37 meters, and the progress is smooth.

    Jiang Xinxiong said that in the next two years, the Qin Mountain Nuclear Power Plant will focus on installation and debugging, and do a good job in preparing for production and operation, to ensure that it will be completed and start generating power by the end of 1990. The Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant, with an installed capacity of 1.8 million kilowatts, will complete the installation of the main equipment of the first unit by 1990, and the second unit's reactor containment shell will be topped off.

    It is reported that the second phase project of the Qin Mountain Nuclear Power Plant, with an installed capacity of 1.2 million kilowatts, has been approved by the State Council and is about to start the preliminary preparation work.

    Jiang Xinxiong emphasized that the Qin Mountain and Daya Bay nuclear power projects must adhere to the principle of quality first and safety first, to ensure the quality of nuclear power construction.

    It is revealed that during the "Eighth Five-Year Plan" period, China will build a batch of large-scale nuclear power plants in Liaoning and the southeastern coastal areas, striving to achieve 6 million kilowatts of nuclear power units built and under construction by the end of this century.

　　秦山核电站抓紧安装设备    
    确保明年底正式并网发电
    新华社北京２月１３日电  （记者赵明亮）中国核工业总公司总经理蒋心雄今天在总公司工作会议上介绍，秦山核电站一期工程和大亚湾核电站已分别进入设备安装和土建高峰阶段。其中秦山核电站明年将并网发电，从而结束我国大陆无核电的历史。
    秦山核电站是１９８５年３月开始浇灌第一罐混凝土，３０万千瓦的一期工程目前已成功地完成了安全壳穹顶和核岛压力容器的吊装，主管道也已开始焊接，质量良好。
    广东大亚湾核电站一号反应堆安全壳钢衬里安装已超过３７米，进展顺利。
    蒋心雄说，近两年内，秦山核电站将以安装调试为中心，做好生产运行的准备工作，确保１９９０年底建成发电。装机容量达１８０万千瓦的大亚湾核电站，到１９９０年，一号机组将完成主要设备安装，二号机组反应堆安全壳封顶。
    据介绍，秦山核电站１２０万千瓦的二期工程已经国务院批准立项，即将开始前期准备工作。
    蒋心雄要求秦山、大亚湾两个核电工程一定要坚持质量第一、安全第一的方针，确保核电建设质量。
    据透露，“八五”期间我国还将在辽宁及东南沿海等地建设一批大型核电站，力争本世纪内建成和在建的核电机组分别达６００万千瓦。
