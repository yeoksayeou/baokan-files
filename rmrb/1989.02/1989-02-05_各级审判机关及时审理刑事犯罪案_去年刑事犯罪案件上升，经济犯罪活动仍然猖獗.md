Courts at all levels have promptly handled criminal cases. Criminal offenses increased last year, and economic crimes remain rampant.

BEIJING, Feb. 4 (Xinhua) — Reporter Mao Lei learned from the Supreme People's Court that in 1988, courts at all levels across the country strengthened their efforts to crack down on serious criminal activities in accordance with the law, sentencing a total of 368,700 criminals of various types, an increase of 12.99% compared to 1987.

It is understood that the general assessment of the criminal situation last year by courts across the country is that criminal cases have increased, with a significant rise in major cases, and economic crimes remain rampant.

A relevant official from the Supreme People's Court analyzed this situation, pointing out that a significant increase in crimes motivated by financial gain is one of the new characteristics of current criminal activities. From January to November last year, property crimes accounted for nearly 50% of the criminal cases handled by courts nationwide. Robbery crimes increased by 42.5% compared to the previous year, and other types of cases, such as human trafficking, are also financially motivated crimes.

It is worth noting that the increase in juvenile crimes is significant. From January to November last year, juvenile crimes increased by 18.69% compared to the same period the previous year, with over 28,000 minors under the age of 18 being convicted. Among all convicted criminals, juveniles accounted for 58.44%.

Additionally, in terms of criminal methods, new approaches have emerged, such as using money and sex to lure victims into robbery, using computers to commit embezzlement and theft, hiring killers for murder, and using electric shocks or drugs to commit murder and robbery.

In the face of the severe public security situation last year, the people's courts adhered to the principle of severe and swift punishment for criminal activities that seriously endanger public security, promptly handling such cases. In Shandong's Juye region, a serious case occurred last year where four criminals boarded a public bus with knives and whips, forcibly took three passengers off the bus, beat and robbed them of over 1,000 yuan, and gang-raped the female passenger. After the case was reported, the people's court promptly handled it and severely punished all four defendants in accordance with the law.

Over the past year, courts at all levels have also collaborated with local public security, procuratorial, and other relevant departments to address prominent public security issues, launching timely campaigns to crack down on theft and roaming criminals. Among the criminals sentenced by the Guangzhou Municipal Court, 40.6% were involved in roaming criminal activities.

The reporter also learned that in handling criminal cases, the courts have paid special attention to being strict when necessary and lenient when appropriate, preventing both false convictions and acquittals, and strictly adhering to legal sentencing.

　　各级审判机关及时审理刑事犯罪案
　　去年刑事犯罪案件上升，经济犯罪活动仍然猖獗
    本报北京２月４日讯  记者毛磊从最高人民法院获悉：１９８８年全国各级人民法院大力强化依法打击严重刑事犯罪活动，共判处各类刑事犯罪分子３６．８７万名，比１９８７年增加了１２．９９％。
    据了解，全国审判机关对去年刑事犯罪形势的基本估价是，刑事犯罪案件上升、重大案件上升幅度较大，经济犯罪活动仍然猖獗。
    最高人民法院有关人士分析这一形势时指出，以图财为目的的犯罪大幅度增加是当前刑事犯罪的新特点之一。去年全国法院１至１１月所受理的刑事案件中，侵犯财产罪即占近５０％，抢劫犯罪比上年增加４２．５％，其他如拐卖人口等类案件实际也是以图财为目的的犯罪。
    值得注意的是，青少年犯罪上升的幅度很大，去年１至１１月审结的案件中，青少年犯罪比上年同期上升１８．６９％，其中不满１８周岁的未成年罪犯２．８万多人。在审结的全部罪犯中，青少年罪犯占５８．４４％。
    此外，在犯罪手段上，已出现了以财、色诱骗进行抢劫，利用电子计算机进行贪污、盗窃，用重金雇佣凶手杀人，用电击、药物麻醉来杀人、抢劫等犯罪的方式、方法。
    人民法院去年在严峻的治安形势面前，对于那些严重危害社会治安的犯罪活动，坚持依法从重从快惩处的方针，及时审理。山东菏泽地区去年发生一起恶性案件，４名案犯在公共汽车上持匕首、七节鞭强行将两男一女乘客挟持下车，殴打、抢劫人民币１０００余元，并将女乘客轮奸。案发后，人民法院及时审理，依法对４名被告全部从严惩处。
    一年来，各级审判机关还针对治安中的突出问题，与当地公安、检察等有关部门互相配合，适时开展打击盗窃犯、流窜犯等专项斗争。广州市法院所判处的罪犯中，属于流窜作案的占４０．６％。
    记者还了解到，审判机关在审理刑事案件中，特别注意该严则严、该宽则宽、防错防漏，不枉不纵，严格依法定罪量刑。
