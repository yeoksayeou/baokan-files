	Angola Begins Implementation of Amnesty Law
	UNITA Refuses Amnesty and Continues Civil War

	Xinhua News Agency, Luanda, February 4 (Reporter Zhaoxiaozhong) The amnesty law issued by the Angolan government came into effect today, with a one-year amnesty period.

	This amnesty law was passed by the Council of Ministers of Angola on December 23, 1988. It was announced that the amnesty law includes Angolan citizens who have committed crimes against the fundamental interests of the people and the state, both within and outside Angola. The precondition for the pardon of criminals is to renounce violence, surrender to the relevant state authorities, and abide by the constitution and other laws. The Angolan government issued the amnesty law to further implement a policy of leniency towards the anti-government armed forces in Angola—UNITA—and national reconciliation. It is reported that UNITA recently announced its refusal to accept the amnesty. A UNITA spokesman recently stated that, due to the government's refusal to engage in dialogue with UNITA, UNITA will intensify its armed attacks on government forces.

　　安哥拉开始实施大赦法
　　安盟拒绝大赦并继续内战
    新华社罗安达２月４日电  （记者赵晓钟）安哥拉政府颁布的大赦法今日开始生效，大赦期限为一年。
    这项大赦法是安哥拉部长会议１９８８年１２月２３日通过的。据宣布，大赦法包括在安哥拉国内、外犯下了违背人民和国家根本利益的罪行的安哥拉公民。罪犯被赦免的前提是放弃暴力，向有关国家机构自首，并遵守宪法和其他法律。安哥拉政府颁布大赦法是为了进一步实施对安哥拉反政府武装--安盟的宽大和民族和睦政策。据报道，安盟不久前宣布拒绝大赦。安盟发言人最近表示，由于政府拒绝与安盟对话，安盟将加强对政府军武装攻势。
