Hugh Baird had good fortune when he took over as chairman of the International Wool Secretariat in July 1988, as it coincided with a rise in global wool prices. Due to the increasing preference of consumers worldwide for natural fibers, the allure of fashionable clothing styles, and the emergence of various high-quality wool products, wool sales have been growing annually since 1986, reaching their highest levels since 1982-1983. From September 1986 to September 1988, the price per kilogram of 19-micron Australian wool doubled, and the price per kilogram of 21-30 micron Australian wool also showed an upward trend.

On a winter day, I hurried to the Beijing Hotel to interview Mr. Baird, who was on his third day in China. In the guest room of his hotel, Mr. Baird enthusiastically introduced the International Wool Secretariat to me. It is a non-governmental organization composed of ranchers and wool producers from various countries, established in 1937. Its mission is to promote the demand for wool. The four member countries that produce large amounts of wool—Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and Uruguay—have a combined wool market value of $3 billion, accounting for 80% of the world's wool trade volume. Currently, the International Wool Secretariat provides services to more than 60 countries, and its services in China began 10 years ago.

I was interested in the content of the "services." Mr. Baird told me that this mainly involves promoting wool products to consumers and local markets through the Secretariat's 34 branches in various countries and regions. It also closely cooperates with manufacturers, importers, wholesalers, and retailers to ensure that consumers can purchase high-quality wool products. Currently, wool products have evolved from single yarn varieties to apparel, carpets, and other indoor decorative wool textiles. To ensure the quality and reputation of wool products, the International Wool Secretariat introduced the globally recognized pure wool label in 1964. Products that can bear this label must be made entirely of pure new wool and must meet the strict quality standards set by the Secretariat. The production units of pure wool products must be factories recognized by the Secretariat. Now, 15,000 licensed manufacturers in more than 60 countries and regions use over 400 million pure wool labels each year. The Secretariat recently issued its 250th pure wool label license in China.

Mr. Baird's visit to China at the beginning of the year was also due to China being the second-largest importer of Australian wool after Japan. Although China's per capita wool consumption is still at a low level compared to other countries, it has enormous potential. However, will China's efforts to curb inflation and overheated consumption, as well as the rise in international wool prices, affect future Australia-China wool trade? I raised this question.

Mr. Baird thoughtfully replied that during my meeting with officials from China's textile industry, we also discussed this issue. He said: With prices rising, we need to make customers happier and more satisfied with their purchases. Buying less but better is in the interest of Chinese consumers. At the same time, we will help wool product manufacturers use raw materials more effectively to produce high-value-added products, not only for domestic consumption but also for export earnings. To reduce costs, we will also provide services in blended fibers and improved technology so that Chinese manufacturers can soon process various grades of Australian wool.

Is this business acumen? The key to success lies in faithfully protecting consumer interests. As Mr. Baird said, the International Wool Secretariat has started with the standardization of raw wool performance, requiring the provision of various test data to customers, including fiber diameter, clean wool rate, grass content, fiber length and strength, color, and fluffiness. Understanding that production development relies on protecting consumer interests, and thus striving to reduce costs and improve quality, is indeed a truly wise business strategy.

### 着眼于维护消费者利益——访国际羊毛局主席休·贝格斯

　　着眼于维护消费者利益
　　——访国际羊毛局主席休·贝格斯
　　蒋千红
    贝格斯先生运气不坏，１９８８年７月他担任国际羊毛局主席时，正值世界羊毛价格上涨。由于各国消费者对于天然纤维的喜好不断增长，富有魅力的服装式样及各类优质羊毛产品争相涌现，自１９８６年以来，世界羊毛销量逐年增长，目前已达１９８２—１９８３年以来的最高水平。从１９８６年９月至１９８８年９月，１９微米澳毛每公斤价格增长两倍，２１至３０微米澳毛的每公斤价格也都呈现增长趋势。
    我赶到建国饭店去采访贝格斯先生的这个冬日，是他中国之行的第三天。贝格斯先生在他下榻的会客室兴致勃勃地向我介绍，国际羊毛局是个由各国牧场主和羊毛生产者组成的民间机构，成立于１９３７年，宗旨是致力于扩大羊毛需求。盛产羊毛的澳大利亚、新西兰、南非和乌拉圭四个成员国进入当今市场的羊毛价值共达３０亿美元，销售的原毛达世界市场贸易额的８０％。目前，国际羊毛局已经对６０多个国家提供服务，它在中国的服务是１０年前开始的。
    我对“服务”的内容很感兴趣。贝格斯先生告诉我，这主要是通过国际羊毛局在世界３４个国家和地区设立的分支机构，向消费者和各地市场推广羊毛制品，并与制造厂家、进口、批发、零售商密切合作，以确保消费者能购买到高质量的羊毛产品。目前，羊毛制品已从过去的单一品种毛线发展到服饰、地毯和其他室内装饰用毛纺织品。为确保羊毛产品的质量和信誉，国际羊毛局于１９６４年推出了举世公认的纯羊毛标志。能挂上这一标志的产品，不但必须完全用纯新羊毛制成，而且必须合乎国际羊毛局制订的严格的品质标准。纯羊毛产品的生产单位，必须是国际羊毛局认可的厂家。现在，分布于６０多个国家和地区的１．５万家获得执照的厂商，每年要使用４亿多个纯羊毛标志。国际羊毛局最近在中国颁发了它的第２５０个纯羊毛标志执照。
    贝格斯先生新年伊始就来到中国，还因为中国是仅次于日本的澳大利亚羊毛第二大进口国。尽管目前中国的人均羊毛消费量比起其他国家来仍处于低水平，但却有着巨大的潜力。然而，中国抑制通货膨胀和抑制过热的消费以及国际市场羊毛价格上涨等会不会对今后的澳中羊毛贸易产生影响？我提出了疑问。
    贝格斯先生若有所思地答道，在我同贵国纺织工业部官员的会见中，也谈到了这个问题。他说：价格提高了，就更要使顾客买得愉快和满意。买得少些，但买得更好些，是符合中国消费者利益的。同时，我们还要帮助羊毛产品厂家最有效地利用原材料，生产附加价值高的产品，不但用于国内消费，而且用于出口换汇。为着降低成本，我们还将在混纺纤维和改进工艺技术方面提供服务，以便在不久的将来中国的厂家就能够加工各种档次的澳毛。
    这是生意经吗？取胜之道在于忠实地维护消费者利益。正如贝格斯先生所说，国际羊毛局已经从原毛性能的规格化做起，规定必须向客户提供各种测试数据，包括纤维直径、净毛率、草杂含量、纤维长度及强力、颜色及膨松度等。懂得生产的发展有赖于维护消费者利益，从而致力于降低成本，提高质量，这确是真正精明的经营术。
