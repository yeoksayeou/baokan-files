Title: Lessons Drawn from the Afghan Issue

The Soviet military has fully and unconditionally withdrawn from Afghanistan in accordance with the Geneva Accords. However, the domestic situation in Afghanistan remains concerning.

The Geneva Accords did not address the issue of the U.S. and the Soviet Union continuing to provide military aid to their respective supported factions on a "symmetrical" basis, nor did it make arrangements for the reconciliation of various political forces within Afghanistan. After the Soviet troops withdrew, the confrontation between the Kabul government and the resistance forces intensified, with the Kabul government declaring a state of emergency nationwide. Public opinion generally estimates that if a solution is not found quickly, Afghanistan may plunge into civil war.

In the later stages of the withdrawal, the Soviet Union was not unaware of the possibility of the current situation. It requested in early this year that the United States stop military aid together with it and sent envoys to shuttle between various political factions in Afghanistan, seeking to achieve national reconciliation based on the Kabul government, but all efforts failed. The Soviet Union had no choice but to stockpile military supplies and provisions for the Kabul government, leaving it to fend for itself.

The lessons from the Afghan issue naturally hold important reference value for the parties involved in seeking a political solution to the Cambodian problem. The most important point is that, in addition to the unconditional withdrawal of foreign troops, reconciliation among the nation must be promoted through equal consultations. Of course, the unconditional withdrawal of foreign troops remains the top priority; without this, the rest is not worth discussing.

However, the Vietnamese authorities have drawn conclusions contrary to common sense from the Afghan example, turning the unconditional withdrawal of troops from Cambodia into a conditional withdrawal, thereby obstructing the progress of solving the Cambodian problem.

The Vietnamese authorities recently vaguely stated that the Vietnamese troops would withdraw from Cambodia by the end of September this year, with the conditions being: first, to gradually stop military aid to various Cambodian factions while withdrawing troops, and second, to achieve national reconciliation among various Cambodian factions. This proposal seems to accept the lessons from Afghanistan, but in reality, their so-called national reconciliation has a lot to it.

On this issue, the five-point proposal from the Khmer People's National Liberation Front (KPNLF) advocates the simultaneous dissolution of the KPNLF United Government and the Phnom Penh government, with the four factions holding equal consultations to form a transitional government to oversee elections and other matters. This is a reasonable proposal. If an agreement could be reached on this, Cambodia could avoid falling into internal strife like Afghanistan and become a peaceful, neutral, and independent country. However, Vietnam does not agree with this proposal, insisting that the Phnom Penh authorities should oversee the elections. In reality, this is to use this opportunity to make the Phnom Penh government the sole legitimate government of Cambodia, achieving the rule of the Heng Samrin faction, allowing Vietnam to continue controlling Cambodia after the withdrawal of troops, and obtaining what it could not achieve on the battlefield. During the informal four-party talks in Jakarta, Vietnam arrogantly declared that if the three factions of the KPNLF did not accept its proposal, it would refuse to withdraw troops by the end of September this year. It is clear that the Vietnamese authorities are using the withdrawal of troops as a pretext, intending to blackmail the international community.

The Vietnamese authorities currently have a misconception, believing that after Afghanistan, people, in their eagerness to do business with Vietnam and the Phnom Penh government, will be willing to accept any high price Vietnam sets for the Cambodian issue. This shows that Vietnam has not learned much from the Afghan example. If Vietnam thinks it is comfortable and wants to continue to be bogged down in Cambodia, then so be it. But blackmail will not work.

　　阿富汗问题引出的教训
    塞北
    苏军按照日内瓦协议，已经全部无条件撤出阿富汗。但是阿富汗国内局势仍然令人忧虑。
    日内瓦协议没有解决美苏按“对称”原则继续向各自支持的一方提供军事援助的问题，也未能就阿富汗国内各派政治力量的和解作出安排。苏军撤走后，阿富汗喀布尔政权与抵抗力量的对抗进一步加剧，喀布尔政权已经宣布全国处于紧急状态。舆论普遍估计，如果不迅速找到解决办法，阿富汗有可能陷于内战。
    苏联在撤军后期，并非没有预见到会有今天这种形势。它在今年初要求美国同它一起停止军事援助，并派出使者奔走于阿富汗各派政治力量之间，谋求以喀布尔政权为基础实现民族和解，但均告失败。苏联只好给喀布尔政权备足军火粮草，让它去好自为之了。
    阿富汗问题的教训，对于正在谋求政治解决柬埔寨问题的有关各方，自然具有重要参考价值。最重要的一点是，除了无条件撤走外国军队，还要通过平等协商促成民族和解。当然，外国军队无条件撤走仍然是第一位的，没有这一条，其余就无从谈起。
    可是，越南当局却从阿富汗的实例中得出了有悖于常理的结论，把从柬埔寨无条件全部撤军变成了有条件撤军，以此来阻挠柬埔寨问题的解决进程。
    越南当局在不久前笼统地表示，越军将在今年９月底以前从柬埔寨全部撤走，其条件一是在撤军的同时逐步停止对柬埔寨各派的军事援助，二是达成柬埔寨各派之间的民族和解。这个主张表面看来似乎接受了阿富汗的教训，实际它的所谓民族和解大有文章。
    在这个问题上，民柬方面的五点建议中主张同时解散民柬联合政府和金边政权，由四派平等协商组成临时政府，来主持大选等事宜。这本来是合情合理的主张，如果能就此达成协议，柬埔寨可以避免像阿富汗那样陷于内部纷争，而成为一个和平中立的独立国家。可是越南就是不同意这个主张，坚持要由金边当局来主持大选，实际上是要借此使金边政权取得柬埔寨唯一合法政府的地位，实现韩桑林一派掌权，使越南在撤军以后得以继续控制柬埔寨，得到它在战场上未能得到的东西。在雅加达四方非正式会谈中，越南曾蛮横地声称，如果民柬三方不接受它这个主张，它就拒绝在今年９月底以前撤军。事情很明显，越南当局这样做不过是拿撤军做幌子，想用它对国际社会讹诈罢了。
    越南当局现在有一种错觉，以为在阿富汗以后，人们为了急于同越南和金边政权做买卖，不管越南在柬埔寨问题上抛出多高的标价，都会愿意同它拍板成交。这说明，越南并未从阿富汗的实例中学到多少东西。如果越南觉得日子好过，愿意继续在柬埔寨陷下去，那就请便。但讹诈，是行不通的。
