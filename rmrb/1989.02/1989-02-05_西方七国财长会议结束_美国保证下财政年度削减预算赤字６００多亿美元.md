The Western Seven Countries' Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors meeting concluded today after lasting 11 hours.

Financial and economic leaders from Britain, the United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Italy, and Canada exchanged views on current international economic issues.

According to attendees, U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady assured the other countries that President Bush would ensure a reduction of over 600 billion dollars in the budget deficit for the fiscal year starting October 1 of this year.

French Finance Minister Pierre Beregovoy told reporters that other countries considered the U.S. commitment "very important." Brady told reporters that the seven countries discussed in depth the debt burden of 1.3 trillion dollars in the Third World and proposed many new ideas to strengthen the existing debt strategy. Other attendees told reporters that they did not make any new decisions regarding solving the debt issue this time, but only reviewed some new proposals, such as the credit easing policies proposed by Japan and France.

According to relevant officials, the meeting also discussed issues of trade imbalances among the seven countries, such as the continued increase in Japan and West Germany's trade surpluses and the limited reduction in the U.S. trade deficit.

　　西方七国财长会议结束
　　美国保证下财政年度削减预算赤字６００多亿美元
    新华社华盛顿２月３日电  西方７国财长和中央银行行长会议在历时１１个小时后今天结束。
    来自英国、美国、日本、西德、法国、意大利和加拿大的财政金融领导人就与当前国际经济问题交换了意见。
    据与会者说，美国财政部长布雷迪已向与会其它国家保证，布什将保证在今年１０月１日开始的下个财政年度内削减预算赤字６００多亿美元。
    法国财长皮埃尔·贝雷戈瓦在给记者吹风时说，其它国家认为美国的承诺“非常重要”。布雷迪告诉记者，７国与会者对第三世界１．３万亿美元债务负担进行了深入的讨论，就加强现行的债务战略提出了不少新设想。其它与会者对记者说，他们这次没有作出任何有关解决债务问题的新决定，仅审议一些新建议，如日本和法国提出的放宽信贷政策等。
    据有关官员说，会议还讨论了７国间贸易不平衡的问题，如日本和西德外贸顺逆继续增加，美国外贸逆差减少不多等问题。
