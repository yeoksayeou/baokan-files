The memorial service for the 10th Panchen Lama began today at the Guangji Temple in Beijing. Vice Chairman of the Chinese Buddhist Association, Dao Shuren, presided over the mourning ceremony. Vice Chairman of the Chinese Buddhist Association and Abbot of Guangji Temple, Mingzhao, read the prayer text from the Chinese Buddhist Association.

The prayer text stated that the Panchen Lama dedicated his life to the country, the nation, and Buddhism, working tirelessly for decades. His contributions are immense and he is deeply respected by the nation. The Lama's passing is an irreplaceable loss for Buddhism in China. His patriotism, dedication to Buddhism, and selfless contributions are the most precious spiritual legacy he left for all Buddhists in the country. We must inherit his wishes and contribute to the prosperity of the nation and the happiness of all beings.

Officials from the State Council's Bureau of Religious Affairs, vice chairpersons and council members of the Chinese Buddhist Association in Beijing, heads of the Advanced Tibetan Buddhist Academy, heads of the Chinese Buddhist Academy, and leaders from national organizations of Taoism, Islam, Christianity, and Catholicism, as well as leaders from the Beijing Buddhist Association and Buddhist disciples in the capital, totaling over 200 people, attended the mourning ceremony.

After the mourning ceremony, a scripture recitation ceremony led by Mingzhao was held in the Great Hall of the Buddha at Guangji Temple.

At the same time, a memorial service according to Tibetan Buddhist rituals was also held at the Yonghe Temple in Beijing, led by Zhamyang Tubdan Lama. Over 200 people participated. These two services will continue for three days.

Today, the Yonghe Temple began a three-day memorial service for the 10th Panchen Lama in the Hall of the Wheel of Dharma. All monks chanted scriptures and prayed for the early reincarnation of the Panchen Lama's soul.
