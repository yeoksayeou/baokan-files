The initial phase of the company cleanup has achieved significant results. The work has now transitioned to focused spot checks and comprehensive rectification.

According to information provided by the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, after more than two months of effort, the self-inspection phase of the company cleanup in most regions has basically concluded. The work has now entered the stage of focused spot checks and comprehensive rectification.

The main achievements of the initial company cleanup phase are reflected in four areas: First, the phenomenon of party and government agencies engaging in commercial activities has been effectively curbed to some extent. According to incomplete statistics from 12 provinces, party and government agencies have established a total of 13,940 companies (enterprises), most of which have been or are being cleaned up. Second, the issue of party and government officials, both in-service and retired, holding positions in companies has been largely addressed. According to incomplete statistics from 10 provinces, 7,357 in-service officials and 2,970 retired officials have been holding positions in companies (enterprises), most of whom have been cleaned up. Third, a number of cases involving illegal resale and profiteering have been investigated. For example, Heilongjiang Province has investigated 709 cases of illegal activities, with 516 cases already concluded, accounting for 73% of the total cases. Among these, 181 cases involved amounts over 10,000 yuan, with 128 cases already concluded, accounting for 70% of the major cases. During the investigation, a large quantity of important materials and scarce consumer goods, including 12,241 tons of steel, 19,106 cubic meters of timber, and 13,410 television sets, were seized, along with a total of 10.2 million yuan in fines and confiscated funds. Fourth, a number of companies that do not meet the conditions for establishment or are unnecessary have been shut down. During the cleanup, various regions have targeted "four-nothing" companies (those without capital, premises, personnel, or a clear business scope) and "shell companies" that engage solely in intermediary exploitation. According to incomplete statistics from 5 provinces, a total of 794 companies that do not meet the conditions for establishment or are unnecessary have been shut down or had their licenses revoked.

The State Administration for Industry and Commerce has pointed out that the main current issues are that the progress of the cleanup work varies across regions, with some places exhibiting a tendency to go through the motions. For instance, some regions and units do not prioritize the work, act slowly, or even refuse to accept spot checks. Many companies' self-inspections are merely formalities. Some places do not strictly handle illegal economic cases, resulting in low case closure rates.

　　清查公司初战告捷
　  现转入重点抽查和全面整顿
    新华社北京２月３日电  据国家工商行政管理局提供的情况，经过两个多月的努力，大部分地区清理整顿公司的自查工作基本结束，现已转入重点抽查和全面整顿阶段。
    前段清理整顿公司的主要成效表现在四个方面：一是各级党政机关经商办企业的现象在一定程度上得到了制止。据１２个省的不完全统计，党政机关所办公司（企业）累计１３９４０户，大多数已经得到清理或正在清理。二是党政机关在职人员和离退休干部到公司兼职、任职的情况多数已得到清理。据１０个省的不完全统计，党政机关在职人员到公司（企业）兼职的７３５７人，离退休干部到公司（企业）任职的累计２９７０人，大多数已经得到清理。三是查处了一批转手倒卖、牟取暴利的案件。如黑龙江省立案的违章违法案件共有７０９件，已结案５１６件，占立案数的７３％。其中万元以上的大要案有１８１件，已结案１２８件，占大要案数的７０％。在查处中，查获了钢材１２２４１吨、木材１９１０６立方米、彩电１３４１０台等一大批重要物资和紧俏耐用消费品，并收缴罚没款１０２０万元。四是停办了一批不具备开办条件或没有必要办的公司。各地在清理整顿中，对无资金、无场地、无从业人员、无明确经营范围的“四无”公司和专门从事中间盘剥的“皮包公司”进行了清理。据５个省的不完全统计，已停办或吊销不具备开办条件或没有必要办的公司累计７９４户。
    国家工商局指出，当前存在的主要问题是，各地清理整顿工作的进展不平衡，有些地方存在走过场的倾向。如有的地区和单位重视不够，行动迟缓，甚至拒绝接受抽查；不少公司的自查流于形式；有的地方对查处违法经济案件抓得不紧，结案率不高等。
