Jiangxi Provincial Tumor Hospital is a facility that treats over 50,000 patients annually and sees over 100,000 outpatient visits. However, due to irregular power supply, normal medical services and emergency treatments have been severely disrupted.

The hospital has imported advanced medical equipment from abroad, including a linear accelerator, a cobalt-60 therapy machine, a simulation positioning machine, and a posterior loading therapy machine, valued at over 6 million yuan. These machines require a constant power supply for operation and maintenance, even when not in use, to ensure stable temperature and humidity. Sudden power outages can easily damage the electronic components, especially the linear accelerator worth over 3 million yuan. Last July, a sudden power outage caused the linear accelerator to shut down for over 20 days, delaying treatment for over 500 patients and resulting in direct economic losses of over 80,000 yuan.

Emergency treatments and surgeries are unpredictable and often require immediate action. Patients may need to undergo surgery or monitoring as soon as they arrive, and the equipment and personnel must be ready for immediate intervention. All these operations require electricity. If the power goes out, the entire rescue operation comes to a halt. This is especially critical during surgeries when patients may have already been prepared for the procedure or are already undergoing it. Sudden power outages without prior notice can seriously endanger the patient's life. Such incidents have occurred multiple times. Last December, the hospital experienced power outages lasting 2 to 10 hours each day, delaying examinations and treatments for over 700 patients, postponing 20 surgeries, and causing five near-misses during operations. The hospital has repeatedly submitted reports and requests to the relevant authorities, but to no avail. This year, power outages have occurred daily. Just as the reporter was conducting an interview, the power went out as the doctors were about to perform a surgery. The elevator was stuck halfway, there was no lighting, the patient on the operating table was anxious and angry, and the medical staff were at a loss.

　　手术中间断电　急煞医生病人    
    江西省肿瘤医院正常医疗受干扰
    江西省肿瘤医院是个年收治病人５０００多人次、门诊达１０万多人次的医院。但是一个时期以来，由于对该院供电不正常，严重影响了正常医疗和门诊、急诊抢救工作。
    该院从国外引进的直线加速器、钴６０治疗机、模拟定位机和后装治疗机等放疗设备价值达６００多万元。其运行和保养都需要电，即使不开机也必须保持温度、湿度的恒定，开机时更忌突然停电，否则电子元件很容易损坏，尤其是价值３００多万元的直线加速器。去年７月，一次突然停电，致使直线加速器停机２０多天，延误病人治疗达５００多人次，直接经济损失８万多元。
    医院的抢救和治疗具有很大的随机性，往往病人一到就立刻手术、监护，设备及有关人员需一起紧急投入抢救，而这些工作都需要电动和照明。一旦停电，整个救治工作便无法进行。尤其是手术治疗时，往往病人已脱衣消毒或正打开胸腹施行手术，就在事先不通知的情况下突然停电，严重威胁病人的生命。这样的情形已出现多次。去年１２月，这个医院每天停电２—１０小时不等，推迟检查治疗达７００多人次，推迟手术２０余例，术中停电出现险情５例。医院多次向有关方面打报告、提要求，可是毫无用处。今年以来，天天不时地停电。就在记者采访时，医生正要为病人手术，又停电了。电梯悬在半空，没有照明，病人躺在手术台上又急又怒，医务人员也手足无措。
