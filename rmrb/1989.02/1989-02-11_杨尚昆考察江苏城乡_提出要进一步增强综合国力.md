Yang Shangkun, accompanied by local party, government, and military leaders, inspected cities and rural areas in Jiangsu Province from January 30 to February 9. He proposed that we should further enhance our country's comprehensive national power.

Yang said during his inspection that the current economic situation is generally good. The morale of the people is high, and the provincial and municipal party committees, as well as the grassroots cadres, are working hard. Various undertakings are making continuous progress.

Yang Shangkun pointed out that although there are some problems and difficulties in economic work, comparing the past 10 years since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee with the past, it is not difficult to see that our country's development and changes are enormous. In just 10 years, we have achieved what we could not achieve in many years before. This is the main sign of a good situation. The current problems are problems of development and progress. Moreover, the Party Central Committee has timely detected them and taken a series of measures. This visit to various places in Jiangsu shows that cadres at all levels have accumulated rich experience and come up with many good solutions to problems. We have reason to believe that after two or three years of adjustment and rectification, we will be able to establish a new economic order and make economic construction gradually move towards a sustained and stable development track.

Yang Shangkun encouraged cadres at all levels to seriously carry out economic adjustment and rectification, solve problems such as economic overheating and consumption inflation, and at the same time strive to improve production and ensure effective supply. We should timely study new problems that arise during the rectification and governance, so that the economy, culture, science and technology, and other aspects can develop in a coordinated manner, further enhancing our country's comprehensive national power.

During the inspection, Yang Shangkun repeatedly emphasized that the whole Party and the whole country should act in unison and work together to ensure the smooth achievement of the economic adjustment goals. We should especially advocate the party's fine tradition of hard struggle. Party and government organs should strictly discipline themselves and set an example of integrity and public service. We should do a good job in party building and spiritual civilization construction, consciously safeguard the party's prestige, work diligently, and push forward the reform, opening up, and economic construction.

In Nanjing, Yang Shangkun paid his respects at the Mausoleum of Dr. Sun Yat-sen.

　　杨尚昆考察江苏城乡    
    提出要进一步增强综合国力
    新华社南京２月１０日电  （记者张行端）１月３０日到２月９日，国家主席杨尚昆在地方党政军领导人陪同下，考察了江苏省城市和农村，提出要进一步增强我国的综合国力。
    杨主席在考察中说，目前的经济形势总的来看是好的。人民群众的情绪高涨，省、市委同志和基层的同志抓工作的劲头很足，各方面的事业都在不断前进。
    杨尚昆指出，尽管经济工作中存在着一些问题和困难，但把党的十一届三中全会以来的１０年，同过去相比，就不难看出，我们国家的发展变化是巨大的。在短短１０年内取得了过去多少年没有取得的成绩，这就是形势好的主要标志。目前存在的问题，是发展中的问题，前进中的问题。而且，党中央已及时察觉，并采取了一系列措施。这次到江苏各地看看，各级干部积累了丰富的经验，拿出了许多解决问题的好办法。我们有理由相信，经过二、三年的调整和整顿，我们就能建立起新的经济秩序，使经济建设逐步走上持续稳定发展的轨道。
    杨尚昆勉励各级干部，要认真搞好经济调整和整顿，解决好经济过热、消费膨胀等问题，同时要努力搞好生产，保障有效供给。要及时研究治理、整顿中出现的新问题，使经济、文化、科技等各方面得到协调发展，进一步增强我国的综合国力。
    在考察途中，杨尚昆反复强调，全党、全国要步调一致，同心协力保证经济调整的目标顺利实现。要特别提倡发扬党的艰苦奋斗的优良传统。党政机关要严格纪律，做廉洁奉公的模范。要搞好党的建设和精神文明建设，自觉维护党的威信，兢兢业业工作，把改革、开放和经济建设推向前进。
