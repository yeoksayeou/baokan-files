The Family of Ni Wei Yu
— Watching the TV Series "Family Education"
Peng Jia Jin

Watching "Family Education" (script by Ye Xin, directed by Cai Xiaoqing, produced by the China Television Drama Production Center) easily reminds one of "Diary of a Madman," "Thunderstorm," and "Family, Spring, Autumn." In terms of the theme of anti-feudalism, "Family Education" can be said to be in the same vein. Naturally, the continuity and similarity of themes do not mean the repetition of works. A work that can be called art always has its unique expressions and discoveries.

What "Family Education" presents and discovers is the feudal nature within a contemporary high-level intellectual. It is this feudal family education that leads to various tragedies within the family that should not have occurred. At the same time, this is an era of transition and change, where feudal family education, in the face of awakened individuals, cannot but encounter strong challenges and impacts. Therefore, there is tragedy, and there is comedy. All of this constitutes the multi-directional narrative lines of the work. Moreover, since these events occur within a family, between father and son, father and daughter, the situation makes one feel very familiar, and the conflicts are particularly moving and heart-wrenching. It not only exposes and criticizes feudal family education but also showcases the growth of new individuals. These are obviously quite different from "Thunderstorm" and "Family, Spring, Autumn."

The image of Ni Wei Yu might come as a surprise. A former Ph.D. from the United States, today the director of a prestigious hospital, how could he be so unenlightened in matters of his children's marriages? However, this is precisely the unique and profound aspect of the work. People often think that feudalism is the result of a lack of knowledge and economic poverty. Little do they know that it also involves politics, history, culture, social psychology, and so on. If many previous works have largely remained at the level of economics and knowledge, then "Family Education" raises the issue from a new angle and height. It wants us to witness: within a family with a relatively high cultural level and no worries about clothing and food, there still exists a heavy feudal shadow, and how it brings various pains to the kind-hearted children.

It cannot be said that Ni Wei Yu does not love his children, nor can it be simply blamed on his stubborn personality and lack of adaptability. Because of differences in marriage, the younger daughter Meng Lin once made him lose face at the dinner table; but he still had his wife secretly send a thousand yuan to support the daughter who had been driven out of the family for her wedding. He also values practicality, in that terrifying era, he let his eldest daughter Meng Ying marry the worker Jin Yuanhua; after the Gang of Four was smashed, he let Meng Yan marry the equally matched Bei Li. If it were not for the "accident," who could say that his matchmaking for Meng Hu and Wu Shancai would not be perfect?

However, all of this turned out to be the opposite, bringing Ni Wei Yu a series of shocks and troubles. Here, the main factor at work is the autonomy of love and the possibilities that the era provides for the Ni family's children to pursue their ideals.

Love is probably one of the most difficult things to express. It is subject to reality, culture, and so on, but it is also personal. Precisely because of this, it should and must be autonomous. Ni Wei Yu's tragedy lies in his disregard for his children's autonomy in choosing love. He wants to replace his children's love with his own "love"; he wants to regulate the richness and uniqueness of his children's emotions with his rationality and utilitarianism. When he imposes his wrong personal experiences on his children, his fate and that of his children are bound to be tragic.

One can imagine that if it were not for the turning point and changes of the era, Meng Ying might not have developed such a strong demand for emotions and spirit. Meng Lin would also find it difficult to discover the other person's talent and develop a sense of admiration. Meng Hu's situation is even more obvious. It is the new era that provides her, a housewife dependent on her husband, with the conditions to pursue self-worth and the courage to "break up" with Wu Shancai. If it were not for the magic of the era, it is hard to imagine how, relying on traditional culture, economic and status advantages, and Ni Wei Yu's tacit approval, Wu Shancai could become a "failure."

It is clear that the plot of a family ethics drama has not constrained the creators' thinking. They have the intention to dissect the family and, by extension, dissect society. The family is a cell of society and cannot exist independently of society. A work with a broad vision and rich connotations should have this pursuit.

If there are any shortcomings, I think it might be that the director and scriptwriter made the theme of "Family Education" and the article too explicit. Things are complex, and the causal relationships of things are also complex. Direct explanatory descriptions are not powerful methods for revealing themes. As artists often say: it is not to act to express character, but to express character in action. From its title, does "Family Education" not seem too straightforward?

### 倪维宇这一家——看电视连续剧《家教》

　　倪维宇这一家
    ——看电视连续剧《家教》
    彭加瑾
    看《家教》（编剧叶辛，导演蔡晓晴，中国电视剧制作中心摄制），容易让人想起《狂人日记》、《雷雨》、《家·春·秋》。在反封建的主题上，《家教》可以说与它们一脉相承。自然，主题的沿续与相似，并不意味着作品的重复。一部能够被称之为艺术的作品，总会有它独特的表现与发现。
    《家教》所展示与发现的，是一个当代高级知识分子身上的封建性。正是这种封建性的家教，酿成了这个家庭内本不该发生的种种悲剧。同时，这又是一个转折、变革的时代，封建家教在觉醒了的人的意识面前，不能不遇到强有力的挑战与冲击。因此，这里有悲剧，也有喜剧。这一切，构成了作品多向展开的叙事线索。加之它们发生在一个家庭之内，父子、父女之间，这情境既让人感到非常亲切，矛盾冲突则格外令人动情揪心。它不但揭露、批判了封建家教，而且展示了新人的成长。这些显然与《雷雨》、《家·春·秋》有着极大的不同。
    倪维宇的形象或许会令人感到意外。一个昔日的留美博士，今日名牌大医院的院长，在儿女的婚事上何以如此之不开通呢？然而，这正是作品的独特与深刻之处。人们常常认为，封建性是知识贫乏、经济贫困的结果。殊不知，它还涉及到政治、历史、文化、社会心理等等。如果说以往不少作品，较多地停留在经济与知识的层面；那么，《家教》便从一个新的角度与高度上提出了问题。它要让我们目睹：在一个有着较高文化层次并且不虞衣食的家庭里，依然存在着浓重的封建阴影，它怎样为善良的儿女们带来种种痛苦。
    不能说倪维宇不爱子女，也不能只是责怪他个性固执而不知变通。因为婚事的歧见，小女儿梦琳曾在饭桌上说得他下不了台；但他还是让老伴偷偷送去一千元钱，用以资助已被赶出家庭的女儿的婚礼。他也很讲究实际，在那个恐怖的年代，他让大女儿梦颖与工人出身的金源华结婚；在粉碎“四人帮”后，让梦岩与门当户对的蓓莉结合。如果不是“意外”，谁又能说他为梦湖与吴善清的撮合不美满呢？
    但是，这一切都走向了反面，给倪维宇带来一连串的惊愕和苦恼。在这里，起作用的主要是爱情的自主性与时代为倪家的儿女们提供的追求理想的可能性。
    爱情大概是属于最难言喻的事物，它受制于现实、文化等，但它又是专属于个人的。正因为如此，它应该而且必须是自主的。倪维宇的悲剧正在于他无视儿女们在爱情选择上的自主性。他要以自己的“爱”去取代儿女们的爱；要以理性与功利心去规范儿女们情感的丰富性、独特性，当他把错误的个人经验强加在儿女们头上时，他与他的儿女们的命运必然是悲剧性的。
    可以想象，如果不是时代的转折与变革，梦颖可能很难萌生现在这样强烈的对于情感、精神的需求。而梦琳也难以发现对方的才华而产生爱慕之心。梦湖的情况则更明显，是新时代为她——一个依赖于丈夫的家庭妇女实现自我价值的追求提供了条件，也使她有勇气与吴善清“决裂”。如果不是时代的魔力，我们很难想象，仗着传统文化的支撑，经济、地位上的优势，以及倪维宇的怂恿默许，吴善清怎么会成为一个“失败者”。
    很明显，家庭伦理剧的构思，并没有束缚住创作者的思路。他们有解剖家庭，进而解剖社会的意图。家庭是社会的细胞，不能独立于社会而存在。一部视野开阔，内蕴丰富的作品应该有这种追求。
    如果要说不足的话，我想可能是编导把“家教”这题目和文章做得太实了。事物是复杂的，事物的因果关系也是复杂的。直接的说明性的描述，并不是揭示主题的有力方法。正像艺术家们常说的：不是为了表现性格而行动，而是在行动中表现性格。《家教》从它的片名开始，是否就过于直露了？
