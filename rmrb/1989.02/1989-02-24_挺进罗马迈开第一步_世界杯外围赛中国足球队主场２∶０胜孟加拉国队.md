Taking the First Step Towards Rome
China's National Football Team Wins 2-0 Against Bangladesh in Home Match of World Cup Qualifiers

According to a report, although China's national football team defeated Bangladesh 2-0 on February 23rd, securing their first victory in the qualifiers for the 14th World Cup, this does not make people optimistic about their prospects of advancing to Rome. This is because the Chinese team only played well for about 20 minutes against this relatively weak opponent.

The high points of the match, which took place at Guangzhou's Tianhe Stadium, occurred shortly after the start of the second half. In the 6th minute, China's number 8, Tang Yaodong, received the ball on the left side of the field and passed it into the crucial area of the penalty box. Number 12, Wang Baoshan, quickly moved forward and, about 15 meters from the goal, managed to get past a Bangladesh defender and scored with a low shot. This was China's first goal in their quest to qualify for the World Cup finals.

A few minutes later, a Bangladesh player committed a foul outside the penalty area, and China's number 17, Ma Chao, took a direct free kick, scoring with a long shot. It is rare for the Chinese team to score directly from a set piece in recent years. If the first half had also seen such long-range threats, the Chinese team might not have played so sluggishly. In the first 45 minutes, although the Chinese team had the upper hand and launched many attacks, they relied entirely on the wingers to loft the ball high into the center of the penalty box for number 9, Liu Haiguang. Under the pressure of the Bangladesh defenders, Liu Haiguang's headers were unable to create scoring opportunities for his teammates, and his four shots on goal were ineffective.

The organization of the Chinese team's attacks was even more problematic, with several instances of passing the ball directly to the opposing team. The Bangladesh team, which was mostly on the defensive, managed to catch the Chinese team off guard in a few counterattacks, with all seven of their shots on goal nearly on target. In particular, number 9, Aslam's long shot, went through all the Chinese defenders and hit the goalpost.

Currently, the Chinese team is tied with Thailand with 2 points in their group. In two days, the Chinese team will travel to Bangkok to play against Thailand on the 28th.

　　挺进罗马迈开第一步
    世界杯外围赛中国足球队主场２∶０胜孟加拉国队
    本报讯  尽管中国足球队２月２３日晚以２∶０战胜孟加拉国队，赢得第１４届世界杯外围赛首战的胜利，但这并不使人们对其进军罗马的前景感到乐观。因为中国队在迎战这支实力不强的对手时，只打了２０多分钟的好球。
    这场在广州天河体育场进行的比赛，高潮出现在下半时开始不久的一段时间之内。第６分钟，中国队８号唐尧东在前场左侧得球，直传禁区要害地带，１２号王宝山迅速前插，在距离球门大约１５米远的地方抵住孟加拉国队后卫，左脚低射破网。这是中国队争取打入世界杯决赛的第一个进球。
    几分钟后，孟加拉国队队员在禁区外犯规，中国队１７号麦超主罚直接任意球，左脚远射再得一分。中国队像这样利用定位球直接得分的情况，近年来并不多见。假如这场比赛上半时也能有这样的远射威胁对手，中国队可能不致打得那样沉闷。在前４５分钟时间里，中国队虽然掌握主动权，攻势甚多，但完全依赖外线队员将球高吊给禁区中央的９号柳海光。在孟加拉国队后卫的夹击看守下，柳海光的头球很难为同伴创造破门良机，自己的４次射门也未造成威胁。
    比起射门来说，中国队进攻的组织情况更为不妙，眼睁睁将球送到对方脚下的失误多次出现。处于守势的孟加拉国队在有限的几次反击中，倒让中国队吃惊不小，全场７次射门几乎弹无虚发，尤其是９号阿斯拉姆的一记远射，穿过了所有中国队员的防守，敲中球门立柱弹出。
    中国队目前在小组内与泰国队同积２分。两天后中国队赴曼谷，２８日与泰国队比赛。
