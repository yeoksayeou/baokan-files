The 19th regular meeting between West Germany and Britain concluded yesterday in Frankfurt, West Germany. Both sides emphasized that the European Community should be open to the world. Chancellor Kohl stressed the need to seize the time before the end of 1992 to prepare actively for the single market. Prime Minister Thatcher believed that the European Community should not set too many detailed rules but should establish a general legal framework to create competitive conditions for everyone. She said that the timing for Britain to join the European Monetary Union is "not yet ripe."

After two rounds of talks, Chancellor Kohl and Prime Minister Thatcher failed to bridge their differences on the modernization of short-range missiles, but both sides emphasized the need for joint efforts and strengthened consultations to achieve results before the NATO summit in Brussels at the end of May. According to reports, the common ground between the two sides is that there should be no third "zero option," and the basic position of the NATO summit statement in March 1988 remains valid. The disagreement is: Prime Minister Thatcher believes that a clear decision should be made on the modernization of short-range missiles now because of the long research and production cycle; Chancellor Kohl reiterated his earlier position of not rushing to make a decision.

　　西德英国首脑会晤结束
    双方认为欧共体应面向世界
    本报波恩２月２２日电  记者江建国报道：西德、英国第１９次例行会晤已于昨天在西德的法兰克福结束。双方一致强调欧共体对世界是开放的。科尔总理强调要抓紧１９９２年底之前的时间积极为大市场作好准备。撒切尔夫人认为，欧共体不应确定过多的细节，主要要制订一个大致的法律框架，给每个人创造竞争条件。她说，英国加入西欧货币联盟的时机“还不成熟”。
    科尔总理和撒切尔夫人在经过两次会谈后，未能弥合他们在短程导弹现代化问题上的分歧，但双方强调要共同努力，加强磋商，争取在５月底的布鲁塞尔北约首脑会议召开之前取得成果。综合此间报道，双方的一致点是，不搞第三个“零点方案”，１９８８年３月北约首脑会议声明的基本立场依然有效。双方的分歧是：撒切尔夫人认为，对短导现代化现在就应作出明确决议，因为其研制和生产周期较长；科尔总理则重申他早些时候宣布的不急于作决定的立场。
