Architecture (various public buildings, factories, gardens, towers, residences, ancient buildings, urban facilities, etc.) is a unique form of human creation. Among all products directly related to human material life, architecture was the first to enter the realm of art. As an aesthetic object, architecture is a product of history. Generally speaking, architecture has both utilitarian and aesthetic functions. However, in different types of buildings, the proportion of these two functions varies. For example, in residential buildings, the utilitarian function is primary, while in monuments, the aesthetic function often takes precedence, with the utilitarian function being secondary. Architectural art can be said to be a unity of utilitarian function and aesthetic effect, as well as a unity of science and technology and artistic skill.

The aesthetic value of architectural art lies in whether its form perfectly expresses certain material and spiritual content, whether its exterior is beautiful, and whether it "suggests" or symbolizes certain "ideas." However, architecture itself has no necessary connection with "ideas." The major early buildings of various countries are mostly temples for worshipping gods, such as Greek temples, Islamic architecture, Gothic cathedrals, etc. In China, however, most buildings are palaces, which are residences for living emperors, not soaring into the heavens to point towards a mysterious sky, but spreading out horizontally to evoke associations with the real world; not with abnormally spacious interiors that can induce a sense of fear; not with cold stone, but with warm wood, etc. These characteristics constitute the artistic features of Chinese architecture. This reflects a spirit that does not emphasize strong stimulation or cognition but rather the influence and cultivation of living moods. Here, the horizontally spread organic group of architecture actually transforms spatial consciousness into a temporal process. The horizontal and vertical space of Chinese architecture allows one to slowly wander through a complex and varied array of pavilions and towers, experiencing the comfort of life and mastery over the environment.

Architectural beauty also lies in the objective laws of formal beauty, fully utilizing the "golden ratio" or similar proportions, and applying aesthetic principles of unity and variation, proportion and scale, symmetry and balance, rhythm and sequence. It also makes full use of abstract, symbolic, and borrowed scenery techniques, and combines them with the active factors of human aesthetic perception to form the character and style of various buildings (open, quiet, serene, majestic, elegant, luxurious, dignified, etc.). The beauty of architecture lies in the observer's complete immersion in the architectural form, giving life and emotion to inanimate buildings. Architectural beauty is a response to human psychological activity. In his essay "Siegfried's Home," Engels vividly discusses: "Greek architecture expresses a clear and cheerful mood; Moorish architecture—melancholy; Gothic architecture—sacred selflessness. Greek architecture is like a bright day bathed in sunlight, Moorish architecture is like a twilight with twinkling stars, and Gothic architecture is like the dawn."

To fully express its aesthetic appeal, architecture must also reflect the environmental atmosphere. Buildings are constrained by their immovable locations, which requires architecture to harmonize with the environment, blending into one, because the environment is the most important factor in the artistic appeal of architecture. The environmental atmosphere creates a sense of atmosphere, which in turn triggers emotions. People living in this most basic environment of architecture are constantly influenced by the environmental atmosphere, producing corresponding aesthetic responses. The artistic appeal of the environment does not just come from the clever combination of natural conditions such as mountains, water, and plants, but more importantly from the spatial relationships within the architectural complex and the relationship between the architecture and the environment. These spatial relationships form an organic whole for appreciation, which is unified, coherent, balanced, and logically structured, creating a specific atmosphere and evoking rich associations. For example, Chinese gardens are winding and full of interest, aiming to imitate and approach natural landscapes. The space is fluid, with obstacles, ever-changing, and full of surprises, yet it can evoke more imagination and emotion. "Mountains and waters intertwine, doubt no path, willows and flowers dark, another village appears," it seeks to naturalize man-made places as much as possible, integrating them with nature. Through various clever techniques such as "borrowed scenery" and "virtual and real," it connects the beauty of the architectural complex with natural landscapes, adding a romantic atmosphere. Whether it is a large complex or a single building, there is a sequence arrangement, a clear beginning, rhythm, accompaniment, main body, and ending, a combination of structures, spatial interweaving, and color coordination, giving people a sense of rhythm and tempo. In this sense, it can be said that architecture has an intrinsic connection with music. The German philosopher Schelling called architecture "frozen music," which is reasonable. This not only describes that architecture, like music, has a clear rhythm but also explains that a perfect architectural sequence is like a perfect musical piece, both having a beginning and an end, a clear theme, and a harmonious melody. Although architecture is a spatial art, due to its sequential characteristics and its fluid process of appreciation, it can be transformed into a temporal art. This transformation of temporal relationships greatly deepens the aesthetic content of architecture and greatly enriches the artistic image of architecture. Environmental beauty is becoming the main content of architectural aesthetics.

Architecture is different from sculpture. Sculpture, in addition to form, also has themes and content. Architecture should not be turned into sculpture. The beauty of architecture must be reflected in the unity of function and aesthetics. Architecture not only provides aesthetic enjoyment through its external form but also expresses its beauty through various sensations that people can directly experience indoors (such as the contrast effects of size, width, height, openness, obstruction, light, and dark). No matter how beautiful the exterior of a building is, if the interior space arrangement is very awkward, inconvenient, unreasonable, and unscientific, it will make it difficult for people to work or live inside, let alone have a pleasant feeling. Again, a building with a beautiful exterior, if the interior design is also reasonable, but the environment is too poor, or not harmonious, people will feel uncomfortable living in it, and the building will also look awkward. For example, the Pyramids of Egypt must be placed in the vast desert to give people a sense of eternal mystery. A Chinese palace placed among the skyscrapers of New York would look out of place. Our ancient temples must be placed in a setting of winding mountains and dense pine and cypress trees to bring people's emotions into a serene and quiet realm. For a large number of residential buildings, our residents currently do not require luxurious decorations or high-grade materials, but only hope that the designers will carefully organize each space, thoroughly consider the details, and create as convenient and comfortable living conditions as possible, giving people a warm and pleasant feeling.

　　建筑艺术的美学价值
    杨永德
    建筑（各种公共建筑、厂房、园林、塔、住宅、古代建筑、城市设施等等）是人类一种特殊的创造活动，在一切与人类物质生活有直接关系的产品中，建筑是最早进入艺术行列的一种。建筑作为一个审美客体，是历史的产物。一般说来，建筑都具有实用和审美的双重功能。但在不同的建筑物中，这两种功能所占的比重是不同的，如房屋之类的建筑，实用功能占主要地位，而纪念碑一类的建筑则往往首先考虑的是审美功能，实用功能占第二位。建筑艺术可以说既是实用功能和美感作用的统一，又是科学技术和艺术技巧的统一。
    建筑艺术的审美价值在于它的形象是否完美地表现了某种物质的和精神的内容，它的外形是否美，是否“暗示”或象征某种“观念”。但建筑本身和“观念”并没有必然的联系。各国早期的主要建筑多半是供养神的庙堂，如希腊神殿、伊斯兰建筑、哥特式教堂等等。而中国则大都是宫殿建筑，即供世上活着的君主们所居住的场所，不是高耸入云、指向神秘的上苍观念，而是平面铺开，引向现实的人间联想；不是可以使人产生某种恐惧感的异常空旷的内部空间；不是阴冷的石头，而是暖和的木质等等；构成了中国建筑的艺术特征。这体现了一种精神，即不重强烈的刺激或认识，而重在生活情调的感染熏陶。在这里，建筑的平面铺开的有机群体，实际上是把空间意识转化为时间进程，中国建筑的平面纵深空间使人慢慢游历在一个复杂多样的楼台亭阁中，感受到生活的安适和对环境的主宰。
    建筑美还在于客观的形式美法则，充分运用“黄金分割”或与其近似的比例，运用符合美学的统一与变化、比例与尺度、对称与均衡、韵律与序列等组合原则，充分利用抽象、象征、借景等各种艺术手段和技巧，并结合人的审美能动因素形成各类建筑的性格特征和风格特征（开朗、静、安详、雄伟、挺秀、豪华、雍容……）等等。建筑与美感在于观赏者建筑形象完全打成一片，使无生命的建筑有了人性，有了情感，有了生气。建筑美是人的心理活动的反应。恩格斯在《齐格弗里特的故乡》一文中精彩论述道：“希腊建筑表明了明朗和愉快的情绪；摩尔建筑——忧郁；哥特建筑——神圣的忘我。希腊建筑如灿烂的阳光照耀的白昼，摩尔建筑如星光闪烁的黄昏，哥特建筑像是朝霞。”
    建筑要充分体现它的美感还必须表现环境气氛。建筑物受到不可移动地点的限制，这就要求建筑必须与环境互相配合，协调一致，融为一体，因为环境是构成建筑艺术感染力最主要的因素。环境气氛构成了意境，意境又触发了情感，人生活在建筑这个最基本的环境里，处处都要受到环境气氛的感染，发生相应的审美反映。环境的艺术感染力，不仅产生于山形、水流、植物等自然条件的巧妙配合，更主要的还在于建筑群的空间关系和建筑与环境的关系之中。这些空间关系构成有机的观赏整体，它们是统一的、连贯的、均衡的和合乎构图逻辑的，构成了特定的意境，唤起了丰富的联想。譬如中国园林迂回曲折，趣味盎然，以模拟和接近自然山水为目标。空间有流畅，有阻隔，变化无常，出人意料，又能引出更多的想象和情感。“山重水复疑无路，柳暗花明又一村”，它追求人为地场所自然化，尽可能与自然合为一体，它通过各种巧妙的“借景”、“虚实”等种种方式、技巧，使建筑群与自然山水的美沟通起来，增加了浪漫的气氛。不论是大的群体还是单体建筑，都有自己的序列安排，都有明确的起始、节奏、陪衬、主体和结尾，都有结构的组合、空间的穿插、色调的配置，给人以韵律和节奏感。在这个意义上可以说建筑与音乐有着某种内在的联系。德国哲学家谢林称建筑是“凝固了的音乐”，是有道理的。这除了形容建筑和音乐一样有着明确的韵律以外，也说明完美的建筑序列有如一曲完美的乐章，都是有始有终，有明确的主题，有和谐的旋律。建筑虽然是一种空间艺术，但由于它的序列特征，它的流动式的观赏进程，便有可能向时间艺术转化。这种时间关系的转化，大大深化了建筑的美学内容，也大大丰富了建筑的艺术形象。环境美正在成为建筑美学的主要内容。
    建筑和雕塑是不同的，雕塑除了形式外还有题材和内容。不能把建筑搞成雕塑，建筑美必须体现在功能和美感的统一上。建筑不仅通过它外在的形象给人以美的享受，而且通过人们能直接得到的室内的各种感受（如大小、宽窄、高低、畅阻、明暗等对比效果）表现它的美。一座建筑物的外形再美，如果内部空间安排非常蹩脚，使用不方便，不合理，不科学，也会使人难于在里面工作或生存，更谈不上愉快的感受了。又如一座外形漂亮的建筑，内部设计也合理，但就是环境太差，或者不协调，人生活的是不舒服的，建筑也会显得很别扭。像埃及的金字塔必须放在广阔无垠的沙漠中，才能给人以永恒的神秘感。中国的宫殿放在纽约的摩天大楼中，就显得不伦不类了。我国的古刹只有放在山回峰转、苍松翠柏的掩映中，才能把人的情感带进幽雅清静的境界。再以大量的住宅建筑来说，我国的居民目前并不要求华丽的装饰、高级的材料，而只希望设计人员审慎地组织每一个空间，周详考虑细部处理，尽量创造方便、舒适的居住条件，使人有一种亲切愉快的感觉。
