Recently, the regional government of our area organized relevant personnel to inspect the security and protection work of 709 subordinate units across the region, discovering that nearly 500 units have many issues that cannot be ignored.

Firstly, some units have incomplete security and protection systems and do not seriously handle negligent personnel. For example, the Jinding County Fluorine Factory lacks a security and protection system. Since 1987, there have been over 30 theft cases, many of which were committed by the factory's own employees. Additionally, in July 1988, 65,000 yuan worth of electrical cables were stolen from the Ningguo Cement Factory. Although the relevant departments have solved the case, the factory leaders have yet to handle the responsible parties.

Secondly, the public security organizations are incomplete, and there are insufficient security personnel. In recent years, some units have even disbanded their security organizations. For instance, the Provincial Key Middle School, Xuancheng Middle School, has long been plagued by theft cases. Recently, this school disbanded its security department, leaving the school's security work in a state of no one being in charge. Not long ago, the Regional Construction Installation Company also disbanded its security department. Furthermore, the internal security forces of the public security organs are also insufficient.

Thirdly, some public security hazards have not been resolved for a long time. The finished product warehouse of the Xuanzhou City Printing Factory stores nearly 100,000 yuan worth of products. Behind the warehouse, there are six households living close by, and the smoke from their stoves often drifts towards the warehouse. Coupled with the factory's poor fire-fighting equipment, the danger is significant. The Municipal Public Security Bureau has repeatedly proposed suggestions to the factory, but the problem remains unresolved. Some of the original third-line factories, after being transferred, have seen a general disorder in public security due to poor management, with theft problems being particularly prominent.

### 加强安全保卫工作

　　加强安全保卫工作
    最近，我地区行署组织有关人员，检查了全地区下属的７０９个单位的安全保卫工作，发现近５００个单位存在许多不容忽视的问题。
    一是有些单位安全保卫制度不健全，对失职人员不作严肃处理。如旌德县氟化厂因没有安全保卫制度，自１９８７年以来，发生各类偷盗案件３０多起。其中相当一部分案件为本厂职工所为。又如，１９８８年７月，宁国水泥厂价值６．５万元的电缆线被盗，有关部门虽已破案，但厂领导人迟迟不处理责任者。
    二是治安机构不健全，保卫人员不足。近年来，一些单位竟把保卫机构撤销了。宣城中学是省重点中学，长期以来，盗窃案件不断发生。前些时候，这所学校却撤销了保卫科，学校的保卫工作处于无人负责的状态。前不久，地区建筑安装公司也撤销了保卫科。还有，公安机关的内部保卫力量也不足。
    三是一些治安隐患长期未解决。宣州市印刷厂成品库存放近百万元的产品，紧靠库房后面有６户住家，炉灶烟火经常飘向库房，加上厂里消防设备差，危险很大。市公安局曾多次向厂家提出意见，但问题就是解决不了。一些原三线厂移交后，因管理工作没跟上，治安秩序普遍混乱，被盗问题相当突出。
