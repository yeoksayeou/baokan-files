The 1988 academic symposium of the Chinese Cooperative Economy Association was held in Baoding before the Lunar New Year. Nearly 100 theoretical and practical workers from across the country gathered to discuss the role of the cooperative economy in the national economy, the current problems within the cooperative economy, and how to develop the cooperative economy.

Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, China's urban and rural cooperative economies have seen significant development. Urban collective enterprises now employ over 20 million workers and have a production value of 250 billion yuan. Urban collective economies, including those run by the public and labor service companies, employ over 7 million workers and play a crucial role in urban economics, particularly in light industry. The cooperative and collective economies have encountered a series of new and old problems during their development, which need to be addressed through deepening reforms.

Participants pointed out that the current system, where government and enterprise functions are not separated and where state and collective enterprises are not distinguished, needs to be reformed. The cooperative and collective economies should operate and manage according to their own characteristics. The state should formulate regulations for the cooperative and collective economies, clearly defining these enterprises as independent economic entities that should not be managed like state-owned enterprises. The property relations of cooperative and collective enterprises should be clearly defined, and their property should not be arbitrarily merged or adjusted. Cooperative and collective enterprises should have independent accounting, bear their own profits and losses, practice democratic management, and have their income distribution decided by the participating members.

Given the current situation in China, it is not feasible to require the cooperative economy to be purely standardized. Various forms of cooperation and alliances should be established and developed based on the different requirements of various fields, industries, regions, and the public. The cooperative economy should have multiple forms, and it can be combined with other economic components and forms in various ways. It is necessary to further develop various forms of cooperation based on family farming. Stock cooperation can be introduced into the cooperative and collective economies, and multiple combinations can be implemented. Cross-ownership and cross-regional alliances can be developed; various enterprise groups can be established. In the past, we simply equated cooperation with collectivization and saw the cooperative system as a means to transform peasants, which led to practical difficulties. China's situation is complex, and it is important to provide specific guidance based on the different situations in various regions, industries, and sectors.

During the symposium, some participants called for the establishment of consumer cooperatives in cities. Consumer cooperatives are economic organizations formed by consumers who voluntarily join and invest. Members can purchase daily necessities at fair prices from the cooperative, avoiding certain additional fees in the commodity circulation process; they can also enjoy discounts on certain goods and pre-order supplies of scarce goods. At the end of the year, if there is a surplus, members can receive a return on their investment or a dividend based on a certain proportion of their purchases. Establishing consumer cooperatives can reduce many unnecessary links in commodity circulation, mitigate the impact of price increases on public consumption, maintain the normal operation of commodity circulation, and have a positive effect.

　　中国合作经济学会１９８８年学术讨论会侧记
    本报记者  洪琦
    中国合作经济学会１９８８年学术讨论会年前在保定举行。全国近百名理论工作者和实际工作者汇集在一起，就有关合作经济在国民经济中的地位、目前合作经济中存在的问题以及如何发展合作经济等问题进行了探讨。
    党的十一届三中全会以来，我国城乡的合作经济得到很大的发展。城镇集体企业已有２０００多万职工和２５００亿元产值，全民办集体、劳动服务公司等城镇集体经济也有７００多万职工，在城镇经济特别是轻工业中占有重要的地位。合作经济、集体经济在发展过程中也存在一系列的新、老问题，需要通过深化改革加以解决。
    大家指出，要改革政企不分、国集不分的体制，让合作经济、集体经济按其特点进行生产和经营。国家应制定有关合作经济、集体经济的法规，明确合作经济及集体经济企业是独立自主的经济实体，不能按国营企业的办法进行管理；要明确合作、集体企业的财产关系，对合作、集体企业的财产不能任意归并和平调。合作、集体企业应该独立核算、自负盈亏，实行民主管理，收益分配应由参加成员决定。
    在我国目前情况下，不能要求合作经济纯粹化和规范化，要根据各个领域、各个产业、各个地区和群众的各种不同要求建立和发展各种合作和联合。合作经济要有多种形式，合作经济和其它经济成分、经济形式可以有多种交错和组合。要进一步健全和发展在家庭经营基础上组织起来的各种形式合作。可以把股份制引入合作经济、集体经济，实行多种结合。可以发展跨所有制、跨地区之间的联合；可以建立各种企业集团。过去我们简单地把合作化当成集体化，把合作制当成改造农民的方式，在实践中吃了苦果。中国的情况很复杂，要注意根据各地区、各行业、各种不同的情况具体加以指导。
    会上，一些同志呼吁在城市中成立消费合作社。消费合作社是由消费者自愿组合、集资入股的经济组织。入社者可从合作社买到平价的日用消费品，免除商品环节的某些附加费用；还可以享受某些商品的减价优惠以及对稀缺商品的预约供应等。在年终结算有盈余时，入社者还可按股金或商品购买额的一定比例取得返还金（分红）。成立消费合作社可以减少商品流通的许多不必要环节，减少物价上涨对群众消费的影响，维持商品流通的正常进行，具有一定的积极作用。
