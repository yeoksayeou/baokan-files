Bush's Governance Style at the Start of His Presidency
— Emphasizing Clean Governance, Bipartisanship, and Consultation with Allies

One month has passed since President Bush took office. During this period, he presented a new government's policy outline to the nation, sketching the general contours of domestic and foreign policies. The *Washington Post* commented on Bush's first month in the White House, saying that the president proposed many limited goals but lacked a grand vision. The *New York Times* believed that the new government acted slowly in foreign affairs, failing to seize the opportunity to formulate specific policies. However, the general public's evaluation of the new president is quite positive. In a poll conducted by the *Washington Post* and the American Broadcasting Company, Bush's scores were surprisingly high. One Republican said that people praised Bush's style and his way of governing the country.

The era in which Bush took office differs from Reagan's time. He cannot, like his predecessor, talk about major changes, proposing slogans such as reducing taxes, cutting civilian expenditures, and increasing military spending. He inherited Reagan's legacy, so Bush, in his first month in office, emphasized the way of governing, which became an important aspect of establishing his own image. Bush's governance style at the start of his presidency indeed showed some new characteristics, which can be summarized as emphasizing clean governance and bipartisanship domestically, and consultation with allies and cautious action internationally.

Clean governance has been regulated since 1978 in the U.S. "Ethics in Government Act," with one key provision being that officials must declare their personal assets and clarify their private relationships with the outside world to prevent potential conflicts of interest. In other words, it aims to block loopholes for public officials to seek private gains. However, over the past decade, cases of official misconduct have been on the rise. According to the *Christian Science Monitor*, such cases increased from 133 in 1978 to 651 in 1987, some of which were major scandals reported in the media that shocked society. Bush has long been involved in politics and is well aware of the inner workings of the political arena. After becoming president, his first action was to reaffirm clean governance, requiring government officials to strictly adhere to political regulations. He then appointed a bipartisan Federal Ethics Reform Commission to study how to prevent officials from using their positions for personal gain and to propose reform plans for clean governance. However, Bush also encountered problems in this area. Many in his team come from prominent families with diverse financial interests. Recently, the media reported that White House advisor Gray also served as the chairman of his own company, which was seen as a potential conflict of interest. Gray subsequently resigned from his government-related position. It is reported that when asked about this matter, Bush stated, "No one is above the law," and even close friends must clarify and avoid the possibility of misconduct.

Emphasizing bipartisanship is another characteristic of Bush's governance style, aiming to make the White House and Congress "row in the same direction" to handle major issues in diplomacy and domestic affairs. Currently, the Democrats hold the majority in both houses of Congress, and resolving difficult problems like the federal budget deficit requires consensus between the two parties and between the administration and Congress. If the atmosphere of partisan opposition continues, progress will inevitably be delayed. After taking office, Bush emphasized bipartisanship, transcending differences, and adopting a spirit of compromise and harmony, not only out of practical necessity but also welcomed by the leaders of both parties in Congress. Bush has served as a congressman and has good relationships with congressional personnel. This month, he either invited congressmen to the White House or personally visited Capitol Hill, demonstrating bipartisan politics in both tone and atmosphere. However, bipartisanship also faces challenges domestically. Some Republicans say that the president's approach is too accommodating. They believe that the strength of the Republican Party lies in opposing the Democratic Party, which is more effective than compromise. Some Democrats also say that if they cooperate too closely with Bush, they would be helping the president easily overcome the deficit crisis, meaning that the Democratic Party should show strength. Therefore, bipartisanship will face various challenges in practical life.

Strengthening consultation with Western European allies and acting cautiously in U.S.-Soviet relations are two characteristics of Bush's diplomatic work. Bush took office at a time when the United States faced major changes and challenges in the world, and many major issues require the Bush administration to make choices. For example, how should the U.S.-Soviet relations be handled after Reagan? This not only affects East-West relations and the Third World but also relates to defense and arms control policies. Currently, the Bush administration has not yet proposed new strategies for foreign policy. On one hand, the personnel in the departments of foreign affairs and defense have not yet been fully appointed, and on the other hand, it is related to the president's cautious attitude. In handling such major diplomatic issues, the United States cannot do without good relations with its allies, among which U.S.-European relations are particularly important. On February 9, Bush reiterated in his congressional speech the need to strengthen the alliance of Western countries, to take a long-term view, and not to be swayed by differences of opinion, once again expressing his willingness to strengthen consultation. Secretary of State Baker, in the first month of the new government, visited several Western European countries, which can be seen as a prelude to Bush's administration strengthening consultation with allies. The intention is not to make decisions on specific issues but to broadly exchange policy intentions, understand the changes taking place in Western Europe, so that the policies being formed by the United States can better "adapt to the changing environment." However, whether this visit has such an effect and whether U.S.-European consultations can be strengthened remains to be seen, but this is indeed the diplomatic approach that the new Bush administration intends to emphasize.

　　布什执政之初的治国方式
    ——强调从政廉洁、两党合作、与盟国磋商
    本报记者  张启昕
    布什总统就职已一月有余。在此期间，他向全国提出了新政府的施政纲要，勾划了国内外政策的大体轮廓。《华盛顿邮报》在评论布什入主白宫第一个月时说，总统提出了许多有限的目标，却缺少一个远大的宏图，《纽约时报》则认为新政府在外交方面行动迟缓，未能不失时机地制订出具体政策。然而，一般公众对于新总统的评价不错，在《华盛顿邮报》和美国广播公司的一次民意测验中，布什的得分出乎意料的高。有一位共和党人说，人们称赞的是布什上台以来的作风及其治理国家的方式。
    布什总统入主白宫的年代不同于里根当年，他不可能像他前任那样大谈变革，提出减少税收、削减民用开支、增加军事费用一类的口号。他继承的是里根的遗产，因此，布什在执政的第一个月大谈治国方式，也就成为他树立自己的形象的重要方面。布什在执政之初的治国方式确实也显示出了一些新的特点，概括地说，就是对内重申从政道德、两党合作，对外强调与盟国磋商、谨慎行事。
    从政道德早在１９７８年美国制订的“廉政法”中就有规定，其中一个重要内容就是官员要申报个人财源，划清与外界的私人关系，防止产生“可能出现的利益冲突”，也就是说，要堵塞公职人员谋取私利的漏洞。然而十年来，官员行为不轨的案件不断上升，据《基督教科学箴言报》称，这类案件１９７８年为１３３起，１９８７年上升到６５１起，其中有些是见诸报纸惊震社会的重大丑闻。布什长期从政，深知政坛内情，在他担任总统之后，第一件事就是重申从政道德，要求政府官员严格遵守从政法规，随即又任命了一个由两党人士组成的联邦道德法规改革委员会，研究如何防止官员以职谋私的不轨行为，提出廉政的改革方案。然而在这个领域，布什也不是没有碰到问题。在他的班子里，不少人出身名门望族，财源多样。最近报界就报道了白宫顾问格雷兼任自家公司董事长，被认为有可能发生公私“利益冲突”。格雷因此辞去了政府外的职务。据透露，布什在被问及此事时曾表示，“无人可以超越法律”，即使是好友，也必须澄清，避免不轨行为出现的可能性。
    强调两党合作是布什总统治政方式的另一个特点，目的是使白宫与国会能“同舟共济”，处理外交和内政方面的重大问题。在今天的情况下，民主党在国会两院均占多数，而解决像联邦财政赤字这样的困难问题，两党之间、行政与国会之间看法并不一致，如果一如既往，党派对立气氛迷漫，进展必然延缓。布什在就职后强调两党超越异见，采取妥协、和谐的精神，不仅出于实际需要，而且受到国会两党领袖的欢迎。布什当过议员，同国会的人事关系不错，在这个月里，他或邀请议员到白宫，或亲自走访国会山，在语调和气氛上都显示出两党政治的色彩。但是，两党政治在国内也不是没有阻力。有些共和党内的人说，总统的做法过分。他们认为共和党的力量在于与民主党对抗，这比妥协更起作用。民主党内也有人说，如果同布什合作过密，就等于帮助总统轻易摆脱赤字危境，即民主党应该表现强硬。因此，两党政治在实际生活中还将遇到各种挑战。
    同西欧盟国加强磋商，在美苏关系方面谨慎行事，是布什政府进行外交工作的两个特点。布什是在美国面临世界经历重大变化和挑战的时代执政的，许多重大问题需要布什政府作出抉择，例如里根后的美苏关系应该怎样，这不仅影响到东西方关系和第三世界，而且关系到防务和军备控制政策。目前，布什政府还没有就对外政策提出新的方略，一方面是外交、国防部门的人事至今尚未配备齐全，另一方面与总统的谨慎态度有关。在处理这类重大外交问题中，美国又离不开同它的盟国打好交道，其中美欧关系更是举足轻重。布什２月９日在国会演说中又一次强调要加强西方国家的联盟，放远眼光，而不为意见分歧所左右，再次表明了加强磋商的意愿。贝克国务卿在新政府上台的第一个月，走访西欧十几个国家，可以说是布什政府加强同盟国磋商的前奏，其用意不在于就某个问题作出决定，而在于广泛交换政策意向，了解西欧正在发生的变化，以便使美国正在形成的政策更能“适应变化中的环境”。然而这一访问是否起到这样作用，美欧磋商能否得以加强，当然还要看，但这毕竟是布什新政府意欲注重的外交方式。
