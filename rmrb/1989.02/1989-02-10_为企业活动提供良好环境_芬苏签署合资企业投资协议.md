　　芬苏签署合资企业投资协议
    新华社赫尔辛基２月８日电  （记者郑焕清）芬兰和苏联关于促进和保护合资企业投资协议今天在赫尔辛基签字。
    芬兰财政部长埃尔基·利卡宁和苏联财政部长戈斯捷夫分别代表各自政府签署了这一协议。
    该协议旨在为芬兰在苏联经营的合资企业投资提供方便，并确保合资企业经营活动的有利环境。
    为实现上述目标，协议将为合资企业的商业活动提供良好的环境，特别是保证提供原料、能源和劳动力以及保证运输、资金筹集和支付活动。协议双方有义务发展合资企业的会计业务，以便对企业的经济地位和盈亏状况作出统计。
    根据协议规定，协议一方的投资将享受另一方的全面保护。如果一方投资成为另一方强制性措施的目标，将向投资者支付适当的补偿金。
    目前，苏芬之间已经建立和正在谈判的合资企业已有数十个。并且，两国还正在酝酿建立经济特区。
