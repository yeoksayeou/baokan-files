Iraq says military has fully withdrawn from Iran, Iran accuses Iraq of still occupying its territory
UN two-Iraq military group discusses maintaining ceasefire issue

New China News Agency, Tehran, February 19 - The spokesperson for Iran's Ministry of Foreign Affairs today denied Iraq's Foreign Minister Aziz's statement that Iraq's military has fully withdrawn from Iranian territory.

The spokesperson said, "Aziz's statement is groundless."

He pointed out that although the two countries have been implementing a ceasefire for over six months, Iraq's military still occupies approximately 2,400 square kilometers of Iranian territory.

He said, "About 100 square kilometers of territory were occupied by Iraq's military after the ceasefire took effect last August."

According to reports received here, Iraq's Foreign Minister Aziz said on the 18th in Baghdad to reporters that Iraq has withdrawn all its troops from Iran.

The spokesperson for Iran's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that Iraq's refusal to withdraw its troops from Iran is the main reason for the stalemate in peace talks between the two countries.

Iran and Iraq began peace talks soon after the ceasefire. The two sides have held three rounds of ministerial-level talks, but none have made significant progress.

New China News Agency, Baghdad, February 19 - The two-Iraq joint working group will hold a meeting on the 22nd in the central border area to discuss the issue of maintaining the ceasefire.

According to reports from the Iraqi News Agency quoting UN two-Iraq military observers, this meeting was proposed by UN Secretary-General Perez de Cuellar. The chief observer of the UN two-Iraq military observer team, Brigadier General Jovic, will preside over the meeting.

　　伊拉克说军队已全部撤出伊朗  伊朗指控伊拉克仍占领其领土
    联合国两伊军事小组讨论维持停火问题
    新华社德黑兰２月１９日电  伊朗外交部长发言人今天否认伊拉克外长阿齐兹有关伊拉克军队已全部撤出伊朗领土的说法。
    这位发言人说，阿齐兹的讲话是“没有根据的”。
    他指出，虽然两国实施停火已有６个多月，但伊拉克军队现在仍占领着大约２４００多平方公里的伊朗领土。
    他说：“约有１００多平方公里的领土是伊拉克军队在去年８月两国停火生效后占领的。”
    据此间收到的消息，伊拉克外长阿齐兹１８日在巴格达对记者说，伊拉克已把其军队全部撤离伊朗。
    伊朗外交部长发言人说，伊拉克拒绝将其军队撤出伊朗是两国和平谈判陷入僵局的主要原因。
    伊朗和伊拉克是停火后不久开始举行和平谈判的。双方先后举行了３轮部长级谈判，但都未获得重大进展。
    新华社巴格达２月１９日电　两伊混合工作小组将于２２日在边界中部举行会议，讨论维持停火问题。
    据伊拉克通讯社援引联合国两伊军事观察团人士的话报道，这次会议是联合国秘书长德奎利亚尔建议举行的，两伊军事观察团首席观察员约维奇少将将主持会议。
