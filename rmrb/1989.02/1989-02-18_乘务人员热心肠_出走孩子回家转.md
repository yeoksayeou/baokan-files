On December 6, 1988, three students from Shangqiu City's Eighth Middle School ran away from home. The oldest was only 13 years old. After wandering around in Yucheng and Zhengzhou in Henan Province, they ended up in Jinan, Shandong Province. In Jinan, one of the children injured his leg and could barely walk. Cold and hungry, they went to the train station waiting room, intending to board the 265th train from Beijing to Xuzhou. A crew member noticed them and led them onto the train, even bringing them food. The train conductor arranged seats for them. Upon arriving in Xuzhou, the train conductor and deputy conductor did not return home but instead took the three children to wash up, eat, and then boarded a train back to Shangqiu. When the children suddenly appeared before their parents, the parents were so moved that they didn't know what to say.

　　乘务人员热心肠  出走孩子回家转
    １９８８年１２月６日中午，商丘市八中３名学生离家出走，大的才１３岁。他们在河南虞城、郑州等地游玩后，到了山东济南。在济南，一个孩子碰伤了腿，已难举步。他们又冷又饿，来到火车站候车室，想乘上北京至徐州的２６５次列车。一位列车员发现后，把他们领上了车，还端来了饭菜，列车长为他们安排了座位。车到徐州，正副车长没有回家，领着３个孩子洗澡、吃饭后，连夜乘车送他们回商丘家里。当孩子突然出现在孩子的家长面前时，家长被感动得不知说什么好。
