Tianjin Shipping Company believes that in serving seafarers, "a hundred empty words are not as good as one concrete deed." Therefore, they have made solving seafarers' various practical problems their main focus. First, when allocating housing, they prioritize seafarers to solve their housing difficulties. In recent years, more than 70% of the 4,000 square meters of housing purchased by the company has been allocated to seafarers. For seafarers whose families live in Qingdao, Dalian, Shanghai, and other places, the company helps them buy houses locally. They also assist seafarers with children's kindergarten enrollment, school admission, employment, as well as daily tasks like buying groceries and coal, eliminating their worries. When seafarers' family members fall ill and are hospitalized, or during weddings and funerals, the company sends people to help with the arrangements.

    ▲天津海运公司为船员家庭办实事被称为“海员之家”　天津海运公司认为，在为海员服务的问题上“百句空话，不如办一件实事”。因此，他们把解决船员的各种实际问题作为自己的工作重点。首先在分配住房时尽量优先照顾船员，解决他们的住房困难。近几年公司买的四千平方米住宅百分之七十以上分给了船员。家在青岛、大连、上海等地的船员公司帮助在当地买房。他们还帮助船员解决孩子入托、升学、就业以及买菜、买煤等各类问题，使船员消除了后顾之忧。船员家人生病住院、婚丧嫁娶，公司也派人协助办理。
