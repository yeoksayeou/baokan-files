China has been pursuing the Four Modernizations for a decade now, and improvements are evident in all aspects of life, from clothing to food, housing, and transportation. This is a positive development. However, the reform process has also presented significant challenges and tests. Some people compare this period to the labor pains before childbirth. I believe that if the pains persist for too long and the doctors are at a loss, the baby born after the pains may be deformed. This is a worrying issue. I will use a couple of examples to discuss with China's decision-makers, as a way to start the conversation.

I would like to start with the issue of transportation. Let's not talk about land and sea transportation for now, just air travel. China's civil aviation industry has made significant progress over the past few decades. Not only do international passengers fly on Chinese airlines, but ordinary citizens also travel extensively within the country. As a result, the balance between supply and demand has quickly become a problem, causing disorder. Although China's airlines are eager to improve, if they do not start from the grassroots level, their efforts may be in vain. China's newly established airlines are all going through labor pains, and many of the issues are man-made. First, let's talk about the mindset. The customers of an airline are the passengers. Without passengers, there is no need for an airline. Therefore, airlines should have a service-oriented attitude towards their customers, not a charitable one. Currently, due to the shortage of aircraft and the high demand, airline staff, from top to bottom, often have a bad attitude and treat passengers as enemies. International passengers would rather take a longer route and fly with other foreign airlines than endure the hassle, cold faces, and frequent delays on Chinese airlines. However, Chinese airlines seem indifferent to this situation because flights are often fully booked. But they should know that competition is coming, and it will come quickly. By then, it will be too late to make last-minute changes.

What is grassroots service? It is the communication between airline services and passengers. When flights are delayed, sometimes there are understandable reasons, but airlines have an obligation to inform and explain to passengers. They cannot leave passengers in the dark for seven or eight hours. Ground staff often do not know anything, which is akin to a policy of keeping the public in ignorance. This approach is absolutely unacceptable today. Airline managers explained to me that the reason for this situation is that staff salaries are not high, leading to occasional bad moods. This cannot be an excuse. The era of eating from the same big pot is over. China's modernization is not the responsibility of one person or one unit; it is everyone's responsibility. Since it is everyone's responsibility, then everyone and every unit has the obligation and responsibility to do their part well. They cannot have the attitude of working one day and ringing the bell for one day. Otherwise, how can we talk about enterprise management? How can we talk about modernization!

I recently suggested to the relevant authorities that we need to change the theory and habit of "not doing wrong is good enough." If something is done wrong, do not blame it too harshly; if something is done well, give more encouragement. This is the first step. Reward those who do well and punish those who make mistakes. This is the only way to truly break the iron rice bowl.

In summary, of course, we are very encouraged by China's efforts to promote the Four Modernizations and are genuinely happy about many successful projects. China's mainland has indeed made significant progress in the past decade. Despite frequent natural disasters, rising prices, and political reforms, a billion people have been able to move forward bravely, which is truly commendable and worthy of our support.

I did not originally intend to write this letter because I have endless sympathy and concern for Mr. Hu Yizhou, the director of the Civil Aviation Administration, and other hardworking officials, especially for Mr. Hu, this dedicated aviation expert. But one person's hard work is not enough; it also requires the cooperation, assistance, and support of all aviation employees. Only then can China's civil aviation business thrive.

Here, I also want to say a few fair words for China's civil aviation. Although airline passengers often suffer, they should also have the common sense and professionalism that passengers should have. For example, within the country, I often see many passengers, including officials, carrying large and small bags, not caring about the safety on the plane. Also, after using the restroom, they do not consider others, so China's airline restrooms often smell terrible. These are the minimum obligations of passengers, and I mention them here as a suggestion to domestic passengers. I hope everyone can understand the hardships of civil aviation employees and cooperate with them.

Two years ago, I shared some observations about the service at the Beijing Friendship Store. Today, I have a friendly attitude towards China's airlines. I offer these heartfelt words to the staff of China's civil aviation, from top to bottom, and at the same time, I take this opportunity to speak for the passengers.

### 向中国的航空公司进几言

　　向中国的航空公司进几言
    美国共和党少数族裔委员会主席  陈香梅
    中国进行四个现代化已有十年了，从衣食住行各方面来看，都有显著的改进，这是可喜的现象。但在改革过程中也遇到很大的考验与挑战，有人说这个时期好比难产前的阵痛，我认为如果阵痛过久而群医束手，不尽快解决问题的话，阵痛之后可能会产生畸形的婴儿，这是令人忧虑的问题，我举一两个例子和中国的决策诸公试作一番探讨，权作引玉之砖。
    我想从行的问题说起。先不谈陆路和海路的交通，只谈航空。中国的民航事业几十年来进步不小，不但有国际人士乘坐中国民航飞机，国内的普通百姓也东南西北地旅游。为此供应与需求的平衡马上就亮了红灯，一时秩序大乱。中国的几家航空公司虽然有心改进，但若不从基层做起，可能一切事倍功半。中国新近成立的航空公司都在阵痛中，而许多困扰，大多是人为的。首先谈观念问题，航空公司服务的对象是旅客，假如没有旅客，根本不需要航空公司。所以航空公司应当对顾主（即旅客）有服务的精神，而不该有施舍的态度。现在因为航空公司飞机短缺，求过于供，因此航空公司人员上上下下常常态度恶劣，把旅客看成敌人。国际乘客宁走远路，搭乘其他外国航空公司的飞机也不坐中国航空公司的飞机，以免受闲气、冷面孔和经常误点之苦。但中国航空公司面对这种局面似乎也不太在乎，因为经常客满。然而君不知竞争是会来的，而且会来得很快，到那时再临时抱佛脚，就会太迟了。
    什么是基层的服务呢？就是航空服务与旅客之间的沟通。飞机误点，有时情有可原，但航空公司有对旅客通告与解释的义务，不能让旅客莫明其妙地坐七八小时的冷板凳。
    地勤人员则一问三不知，这简直是愚民政策。这种经营态度今时今日是绝对行不通的。航空主管人员向我解释说造成这种状况的原因是工作人员的薪金不高，因而有时情绪不好。这绝对不能成为借口，吃大锅饭的时代已经过去，中国要现代化不是一个人、一个单位的事，而是大家的事。既是大家的事，那么每个人、每个单位都有义务与责任把自己份内的事做好，不能再有做一天和尚撞一天钟的心态，不然谈何企业化！谈何现代化！
    我最近向有关当局建议，我们要把不做不错这种理论与习惯改过来，做错了，不要责之过急；做好了，要多所鼓励。这样才能物尽其用，人尽其才，这是第一步。有功受赏，有过受罚。这样才能真正打破铁饭碗。
    话说回来，当然，我们对中国推行四个现代化的各种努力感到不胜鼓舞，而且为许多大有成绩的项目感到由衷的高兴。中国大陆近十年来确实是大有进步。十亿人口在天灾频仍、物价上涨、政治改革的动荡中仍能勇往直前，实在不容易，而且值得我们支持。
    我本来不想写这封信，因为我对民航局长胡逸洲先生和其他数位辛苦的负责人有无尽的同情与关注，尤其是对胡局长这位任劳任怨的航空专家有无尽的敬意。但光是他一人苦干是不够的，还要有全部航空员工的合作、协助与支持，这样中国民航的业务才会蒸蒸日上。
    这里，我也为中国民航说几句公道话。民航公司的乘客虽然常受委屈，但他们也该有做乘客应有的常识与业务。比如说，在国内我常常看到许多乘客，包括长官在内，一个人就手提大小包多件，不顾机上的安全。还有用了洗手间之后也不为其他人着想，因此中国民航的洗手间经常臭气冲天。这些都是旅客们起码的义务，我在此提出来作为向国内乘客们的建议。希望大家能够体谅民航员工的甘苦，与他们合作。
    两年前我对北京友谊商店的服务谈过一些观感，今日对于中国的民航公司也是一片友善的情怀。我把这些肺腑之言献给中国民航的上下工作人员，同时也借此机会替旅客说说心里话。
