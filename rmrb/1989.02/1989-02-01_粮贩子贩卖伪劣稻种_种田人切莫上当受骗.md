    Grain dealers in our county have recently been buying large quantities of inferior rice seeds from farmers and passing them off as high-quality varieties to sell elsewhere. In October 1988, Wang Kaixin, a farmer from Yanzichun Village, Ziyunqiao Township in our county, purchased nearly 5,000 kilograms of inferior rice seeds locally, falsely claiming they were "Weiyou-64" rice seeds, intending to sell them to Guangxi and Sichuan. He was caught by the relevant authorities.

    It is understood that some seed companies from other provinces have come to our county to privately sign contracts with rice seed dealers to purchase fake and inferior seeds. The seed company from Lianyuan County, Hunan, signed a contract with Liu Jichong, a farmer from Ziyunqiao Township in our county, and Wang Zeyong, a farmer from Taihetang Township, to purchase 4,000 kilograms of supposedly high-quality rice seeds. They paid Liu and Wang over 11,000 yuan as advance payment. Just as Liu and Wang were about to ship the goods, they were caught by the industrial and commercial administration. It turned out that they were preparing to ship fake and inferior rice seeds.

    In 1988, hybrid rice seed production was generally poor nationwide, and this year the market for hybrid rice seeds will definitely be tight. Therefore, strengthening the management of the seed market is an issue that all places should pay attention to before the spring planting season.

　　粮贩子贩卖伪劣稻种  种田人切莫上当受骗
    近来，我县不少人大量收购农户的劣质稻种，冒充优良品种销往外地。１９８８年１０月，我县紫云桥乡燕子村农民王开新，在当地收购近５０００公斤劣质稻种，谎称是“威优——６４”稻种，准备运往广西、四川等地销售，被有关部门查获。
    据了解，一些外地的种子公司到我县私自与稻种贩子签订合同，收购伪劣稻种。湖南涟源县种子公司与我县紫云桥乡农民刘继冲和太和堂镇农民王泽永签订了４０００公斤所谓优良稻种的购销合同，并付给刘、王２人１．１万多元代收金。刘、王已备齐货，即将发货之际，被工商部门查获。原来，他们准备发的全是伪劣稻种。
    １９８８年，各地杂交稻制种普遍歉收，今年市场上杂交稻种一定十分紧缺。因此，加强种子市场管理，是春播前各地应当重视的问题。
