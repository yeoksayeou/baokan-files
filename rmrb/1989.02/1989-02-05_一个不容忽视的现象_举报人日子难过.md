A phenomenon that cannot be ignored — the hardships of whistleblowers

On January 16, the Workers' Daily published an article by Cheng Jinglin, which highlighted a significant issue from the letters received in recent months: many whistleblowers are facing difficulties. The issues or individuals reported are usually investigated by relevant departments. However, whistleblowers often face repercussions such as being transferred from their positions, demoted, or arbitrarily labeled as "redundant personnel," and some even have their bonuses and salaries withheld.

Yu Jiaguan from the Weifang First Light Industry Machinery Factory in Shandong reported to the relevant departments about the illegal sale of steel materials by a service company within the Weifang Light Industry System. In October of last year, his salary was immediately withheld, and he did not receive any bonuses for the following three months. Despite reporting to the relevant departments, no one has addressed the issue to this day.

Some units do not openly retaliate against whistleblowers but use various means to isolate them. For example, they spread rumors among the masses: "So-and-so is deliberately ruining everyone's livelihood." "What's wrong with sharing a bit more money? By reporting, not only did we lose the money we had, but we also incurred additional losses." This makes the whistleblower a target of public criticism and difficult to stay in the unit.

A quality inspection director from a boiler factory in a certain city in Hunan reported to the relevant departments that the boilers produced by the factory were substandard, but the factory director used his authority to force the sale of the substandard boilers. The letter was forwarded to the factory director, and this director was demoted, with the reason given as "work requirements."

This is a serious issue. Why are the reports forwarded to the individuals being reported? Whistleblowing is about allowing every citizen to exercise their democratic rights normally. If there are no corresponding protective measures, leading to whistleblowers having no place to stay, then the purpose of whistleblowing is lost.

### 一个不容忽视的现象——举报人日子难过

　　一个不容忽视的现象
　　——举报人日子难过
    １月１６日《工人日报》程京林的文章说，从我们近几个月收到的群众来信中，发现一个值得重视的问题：不少举报人日子难过。被举报的人或事，一般都由有关部门查处。但举报人有的被调离原岗位，有的被撤职，有的莫名其妙地成为“富余人员”，有的被扣发奖金工资。
    山东潍坊第一轻工机械厂于加淦向有关部门举报了潍坊一轻系统某单位的服务公司非法倒卖钢材的问题。去年１０月份的工资当即被扣发，以后３个月的奖金也没份儿。向有关部门反映，至今无人过问。
    还有些单位不明着打击举报人，但却利用种种手段孤立举报人。如在群众中散布：“某某某是存心砸大伙儿的饭碗。”“大家多分点儿钱有什么不好？这一告，把到手的钱告飞了不说，还倒赔了许多。”使举报人在不明真相的群众中成了众矢之的，难以存身。
    湖南某市锅炉厂的一位质检科长，向有关部门举报本厂生产的锅炉不合格，而厂长利用职权强行将不合格的锅炉出厂。信被有关部门转到厂长的手中，这位科长被撤了职，理由是：“工作需要”。
    这是一个严肃的问题，为什么举报材料会被转到被举报人手中？举报是为了让每一位公民正常地行使自己的民主权利，如果缺乏相应的保护措施，导致举报人无处存身，也就失去了举报中心存在的意义。
