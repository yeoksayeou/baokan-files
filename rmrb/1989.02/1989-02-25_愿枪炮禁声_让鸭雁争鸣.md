In recent years, some people in the Weishan Lake area have frequently carried homemade guns and cannons, rowed small boats onto the lake to hunt ducks and geese. During the hunting season, gunshots echo across the lake every night. According to an investigation, just in our county, there are over 3,000 homemade guns and cannons used specifically for hunting wild ducks. Various types of nets are even more numerous and impossible to count.

In the past, every autumn and winter, flocks of wild ducks would migrate to Weishan Lake, covering the sky. Now, people can only occasionally see a few ducks.

The Weishan Lake area is rich in bird resources, with over 20 species of geese and ducks alone. The area is also home to swans, grey cranes, and mandarin ducks. In 1982, our province designated Weishan Lake as a bird nature reserve. However, in the Weishan Lake area, many people treat the law as a joke and continue to illegally hunt and kill rare and beneficial birds. The number of such people is increasing, and relevant departments turn a blind eye to the lawbreakers, leading to the situation where the wild duck resources in the Weishan Lake area are on the verge of extinction.

　　愿枪炮禁声　让鸭雁争鸣
    近年来，微山湖区的一些人经常扛着土枪，抬着土炮，划着小船到湖上打鸭雁。一到狩猎季节，每天晚上，湖面枪声不断。经调查，仅我县就有专猎野鸭的土枪土炮３０００多支，各式各样的捕网更是无法统计。
    过去，每年的秋末冬初，一群群到微山湖越冬的野鸭遮天盖地。如今，人们只能偶尔看到三五只野鸭了。
    微山湖区鸟类资源极为丰富，仅雁鸭类就有２０多种。湖区内还生活着天鹅、灰鹤、鸳鸯，１９８２年我省把微山湖列入鸟类自然保护区。可是，在微山湖区，不少人视法律为儿戏，依然乱捕滥杀珍禽益鸟的人越来越多，有关部门对违法者视而不见，造成了微山湖区野鸭资源濒临绝迹的境地。　山东微山县　渐怀远
