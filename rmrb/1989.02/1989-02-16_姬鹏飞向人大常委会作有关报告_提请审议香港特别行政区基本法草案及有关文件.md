Ji Pengfei Reports to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress
Proposing the Review of the Draft Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and Related Documents

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 15 - Ji Pengfei, Chairman of the Drafting Committee for the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China, today reported to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on the proposal to review the "Draft Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China" and related documents.

Ji Pengfei said that the Drafting Committee for the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China, after three and a half years of work, passed the "Draft Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China" (including three appendices) at the Eighth Plenary Session of the Drafting Committee on January 14 of this year. They also passed the "Draft Decision of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China on the Methods for the Formation of the First Government and Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region" and the "Suggestion of the Drafting Committee for the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region to Establish the Basic Law Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region under the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress."

He said that the Draft Basic Law was completed through the joint efforts of all members of the Drafting Committee, with active participation and cooperation from various sectors of Hong Kong society and relevant parties on the mainland. It is particularly worth noting that the Consultative Committee for the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region has provided active and effective assistance to the drafting work. They have conducted extensive publicity and promotion of the Basic Law in Hong Kong through various means, collecting a large amount of opinions and suggestions related to the Basic Law. Over the past three years, seven delegations of more than 100 consultants have come to Beijing to exchange views with the drafting committee on the mainland. The work of the Consultative Committee has been highly praised by the drafting committee members.

Regarding the overall structure of the Draft Basic Law, Ji Pengfei said that the current Draft Basic Law has a preamble, nine chapters, 159 articles, and three appendices. Excluding the preamble, the titles of the chapters and appendices are as follows: Chapter 1 General Provisions, Chapter 2 Relationship between the Central Government and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Chapter 3 Basic Rights and Duties of Residents, Chapter 4 Political Structure, Chapter 5 Economy, Chapter 6 Education, Science, Culture, Sports, Religion, Labor, and Social Services, Chapter 7 External Affairs, Chapter 8 Interpretation and Amendment of the Law, Chapter 9 Supplementary Provisions, Appendix 1 Methods for the Election of the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Appendix 2 Methods for the Election of the Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Appendix 3 National Laws to be Applied in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.

He said that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, to be established on July 1, 1997, is an inseparable part of the People's Republic of China and enjoys a high degree of autonomy. The government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region will be composed of local residents, i.e., permanent residents of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region will not implement socialist systems and policies, maintaining the capitalist economic system and way of life for 50 years without change. The Draft Basic Law clearly stipulates in Chapters 1, 2, 7, and 9 the legal status of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, the relationship between the Constitution of the People's Republic of China and the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, the scope of powers of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, and its mutual relationship with the Central Government.

He said that regarding the scope of powers of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and its relationship with the Central Government, the Draft Basic Law stipulates that the defense and foreign affairs of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region will be managed by the Central People's Government; the Chief Executive and principal officials of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region will be appointed by the Central People's Government upon nomination; the power to amend and interpret the Basic Law belongs to the National People's Congress and its Standing Committee; the budget and final accounts of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and the laws enacted by the Legislative Council will be reported to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for record. These provisions are necessary to reflect national sovereignty and are in the interests of all Chinese people, including the people of Hong Kong. At the same time, the draft also stipulates that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region enjoys executive power, legislative power, independent judicial power, and final adjudication power; the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government is responsible for maintaining local social order; it is also stipulated that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, with the authorization of the Central People's Government, will handle relevant external affairs on its own in accordance with this Law. These provisions are necessary for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region to implement a high degree of autonomy and maintain stability and prosperity.

Regarding the political structure of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, he said that in accordance with the general policy of "one country, two systems," the design of the political structure of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region cannot simply copy the mainland or foreign systems, but must start from the legal status of Hong Kong and the actual situation of Hong Kong. It should be conducive to the stability and prosperity of Hong Kong, promote the development of the capitalist economy; it should also take into account the interests of various sectors of society and be acceptable to the majority. It is necessary to maintain the effective parts of the current political structure of Hong Kong and gradually develop a democratic system suitable for Hong Kong. The relationship between the executive, legislative, and judicial organs of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region should be one of mutual checks and balances and cooperation; the judicial organs and procuratorial departments should operate independently and be free from any interference. To maintain administrative efficiency, the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region should have real power, but should also be subject to supervision. Based on these principles, Chapter 4 of the Draft Basic Law stipulates the powers of the Chief Executive, executive organs, legislative organs, and judicial organs, as well as the relationship between the executive and legislative organs. It also stipulates in this chapter and in Appendices 1 and 2 the methods for the election of the Chief Executive and the Legislative Council. In addition, the Draft Basic Law stipulates that the Chief Executive, principal officials, members of the Executive Council, the President of the Legislative Council, and the Chief Justice of the Court of Final Appeal and the High Court must be Chinese citizens who are permanent residents of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. This is necessary to reflect national sovereignty.

Regarding the basic rights and duties of residents, he said that Chapter 3 of the Draft Basic Law stipulates the definition of residents of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, the various freedoms and rights enjoyed by residents of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and other persons, and also stipulates that the relevant provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and the International Labor Conventions applicable to Hong Kong will continue to be implemented through the laws of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. The draft also stipulates that the institutions for safeguarding the basic rights and freedoms of residents will be based on the provisions of the Basic Law, thus providing full protection for the freedoms and rights of residents and other persons in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.

Regarding the economy and education, science, culture, sports, religion, labor, and social services, Ji Pengfei said that Chapters 5 and 6 of the Draft Basic Law make separate provisions for these two aspects. Some people in Hong Kong and the mainland believe that these two chapters contain too many policy clauses and suggest that they be deleted from the Basic Law or made into appendices. However, considering that the Chinese government has already promised in the Sino-British Joint Declaration to include the basic policies of the Chinese government on Hong Kong and the specific explanations of the basic policies in Annex I of the Sino-British Joint Declaration in the Basic Law, and considering that even as an appendix to the Basic Law, they still have the same legal force as the Basic Law. After repeated studies by the Drafting Committee, it was decided to retain these clauses in the Basic Law, but to make significant modifications to the two clauses with more controversy, namely maintaining a balanced budget and continuing the low tax policy, making them more flexible.

He said in conclusion that although the Drafting Committee has submitted the Draft Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, there are still some issues that need to be further resolved, such as Article 19 regarding the judicial jurisdiction of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region courts, the methods for the election of the Chief Executive and the Legislative Council, etc., which need to be further modified and improved after the draft is published for comments. The work of selecting the regional flag and emblem also needs to be studied and resolved. These all require the Drafting Committee for the Basic Law to continue its work.

　　姬鹏飞向人大常委会作有关报告   
    提请审议香港特别行政区基本法草案及有关文件
    新华社北京２月１５日电  香港特别行政区基本法起草委员会主任委员姬鹏飞今天向人大常委会作了关于提请全国人大常委会审议《中华人民共和国香港特别行政区基本法（草案）》及有关文件的报告。
    姬鹏飞说，中华人民共和国香港特别行政区基本法起草委员会经过三年半的工作，于今年１月１４日起草委员会第八次全体会议上通过了《中华人民共和国香港特别行政区基本法（草案）》（包括三个附件），还通过了起草委员会为全国人民代表大会代拟的《中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会关于香港特别行政区第一届政府和立法会产生办法的决定（草案）》和《香港特别行政区基本法起草委员会关于设立全国人民代表大会常务委员会香港特别行政区基本法委员会的建议》。
    他说，基本法（草案），是在起草委员会全体委员的共同努力下，在香港社会各阶层以及内地各有关方面的积极参与和大力协作下完成的。需要特别指出的是，香港特别行政区基本法咨询委员会对基本法的起草工作一直给予了积极有效的协助。他们在香港通过多种形式开展对基本法的宣传、推广工作，收集了大量有关基本法的意见和建议。３年多来，先后有七批咨询委员百余人次来北京同内地的起草委员交换意见。咨询委员会的工作得到了起草委员们的好评。
    关于基本法（草案）的总体结构，姬鹏飞说，目前的基本法（草案），共有序言、九章一百五十九条和三个附件。除序言外，各章及附件的标题是，第一章总则，第二章中央和香港特别行政区的关系，第三章居民的基本权利和义务，第四章政治体制，第五章经济，第六章教育、科学、文化、体育、宗教、劳工和社会服务，第七章对外事务，第八章本法的解释和修改，第九章附则，附件一《香港特别行政区行政长官的产生办法》，附件二《香港特别行政区立法会的产生办法》，附件三《在香港特别行政区实施的全国性法律》。
    他说，将于１９９７年７月１日设立的香港特别行政区，是中华人民共和国不可分离的部分，同时又享有高度自治权。香港特别行政区政府由当地人，即由香港特别行政区永久性居民组成。香港特别行政区将不实行社会主义制度和政策，保持资本主义社会经济制度和生活方式，５０年不变。基本法（草案）第一、二、七、九等章对香港特别行政区的法律地位、中华人民共和国宪法与香港特别行政区基本法的关系、香港特别行政区的职权范围以及同中央的相互关系，作了明确的规定。
    他说，关于香港特别行政区的职权范围以及同中央的关系，基本法（草案）规定，香港特别行政区的国防和外交事务由中央人民政府管理；香港特别行政区行政长官和政府主要官员须报请中央人民政府任命；基本法的修改权和解释权属于全国人民代表大会和人大常委会；香港特别行政区的财政预、决算和立法会制定的法律，须报全国人大常委会备案。这些规定，是体现国家主权所必须的，也是符合全中国人民、包括香港同胞的利益的。同时草案又规定，香港特别行政区享有行政管理权、立法权、独立的司法权和终审权；香港特别行政区政府负责维持当地的社会治安；还规定，香港特别行政区根据中央人民政府的授权，依照本法自行处理有关的对外事务。这些规定，又是香港特别行政区实行高度自治，保持稳定和繁荣所必须的。
    关于香港特别行政区的政治体制，他说，根据“一个国家，两种制度”的总方针，香港特别行政区政治体制的设计，既不能照搬内地，也不能照搬外国，而必须从香港的法律地位和香港的实际情况出发。既要有利于香港的稳定和繁荣，促进资本主义经济的发展；又要兼顾社会各阶层的利益，为大多数人所接受。要保持香港现有政治体制中行之有效的部分，又要循序渐进地逐步发展适合香港情况的民主制度。香港特别行政区行政机关、立法机关和司法机关之间的关系，应该是行政机关和立法机关既互相制衡又互相配合；司法机关和检察部门则独立进行工作，不受任何干涉。为了保持行政效率，香港特别行政区行政长官要有实权，同时，又应受到监督。根据上述原则，基本法（草案）第四章对行政长官、行政机关、立法机关和司法机关的职权，以及行政机关和立法机关之间的关系作了规定。同时还在这一章和附件一、附件二中对行政长官和立法会的产生作了规定。此外，基本法（草案）还规定，行政长官、政府主要官员、行政会议成员、立法会主席、终审法院和高等法院的首席法官都必须由香港特别行政区永久性居民中的中国公民担任。这是体现国家主权所必须的。
    关于居民的基本权利和义务，他说，基本法（草案）第三章规定了香港特别行政区居民的定义，规定了香港特别行政区居民及其他人享有的各项自由和权利，还规定《公民权利和政治权利国际公约》、《经济、社会与文化权利的国际公约》和国际劳工公约适用于香港的有关规定继续有效，通过香港特别行政区的法律实施。草案还规定，有关保障居民的基本权利和自由的制度，以基本法的规定为依据，这样就为香港特别行政区居民和其他人的自由和权利提供了充分的保障。
    关于经济和教育、科学、文化、体育、宗教、劳工、社会服务，姬鹏飞说，基本法（草案）第五、六章对上述两方面分别作出了规定。香港和内地有一些人士认为这两章政策性条款太多，建议从基本法中删去或另作附件。但考虑到我国政府在中英联合声明中已承诺将把我国政府对香港的基本方针政策和中英联合声明附件一对上述基本政策的具体说明写入基本法，同时考虑到即使作为基本法的附件，仍然和基本法具有同等法律效力。经起草委员会反复研究，决定将这些条款仍保留在基本法中，但对争议较大的两条，即保持财政收支基本平衡和继续实行低税制作了较大的修改，使之更具有弹性。
    他最后说，起草委员会虽然已提交了香港特别行政区基本法（草案），但目前这部草案尚有一些问题需要进一步解决，如第十九条关于香港特别行政区法院司法管辖权的规定，关于行政长官和立法会的产生办法等，尚有待于草案公布征求意见后进一步加以修改和完善，区旗区徽图案的评选工作也有待于研究解决。这些都需要基本法起草委员会继续进行工作。
