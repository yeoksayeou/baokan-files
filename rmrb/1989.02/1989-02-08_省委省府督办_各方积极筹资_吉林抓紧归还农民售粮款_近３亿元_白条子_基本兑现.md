The provincial Party and government are supervising the mobilization of resources from various quarters. Jilin Province is expediting the reimbursement of farmers' grain sales payments. Nearly 300 million yuan in "white notes" have been basically reimbursed.

	The People's Daily reports: As of January 31, Jilin Province's outstanding grain sales payments to farmers, amounting to nearly 300 million yuan in "white notes," have been basically reimbursed.

	In 1988, Jilin Province achieved a new grain harvest, with a total production of 16.93 million tons, setting a new historical record. Farmers enthusiastically sold grain to the state. By the end of January this year, the province had purchased 6.5 million tons of grain, exceeding the contracted purchase quota by 51%. However, due to financial constraints, some places issued "white notes" as temporary substitutes for grain sales payments. The province's total "white notes" amounted to 298 million yuan. Farmers who received only "white notes" after selling grain had many complaints. The Jilin Provincial Party Committee and Provincial Government attached great importance to this issue and actively raised funds to reimburse the farmers for the "white notes." Under the supervision of the provincial Party and government, by January 24, the People's Bank of China, various specialized banks, and the grain department had raised 460 million yuan in funds for the purchase of agricultural and sideline products, which were distributed in batches to various cities, counties, and districts. Most of these funds were used to reimburse the "white notes." Local banks and grain departments worked closely together to expedite the reimbursement. By the end of January, the province's outstanding grain sales payments to farmers had been basically reimbursed, allowing farmers to have a happy Spring Festival.

　　吉林抓紧归还农民售粮款
    近３亿元“白条子”基本兑现
    本报讯  记者李安达报道：截至１月３１日，吉林省欠农民售粮款近３亿元的“白条子”已基本兑现。
    １９８８年吉林省粮食获得新的丰收，总产达到１６９３万吨，创历史新水平。广大农民积极向国家交售粮食。到今年１月底，全省收购粮食６５０万吨，超过合同定购数的５１％。但由于资金紧张，一些地方出现了以“白条子”暂替售粮款的现象。全省“白条子”共达２．９８亿元。售粮后只拿到一张“白条子”的农民意见很大。吉林省委、省政府对此非常重视，积极筹措资金使农民兑现“白条子”。在省委省政府督办下，到１月２４日，省人民银行、各专业银行和粮食部门共筹集农副产品收购资金４．６亿元，先后分批下拨到各地、市、县，其中大部分用于兑现“白条子”。各地银行和粮食部门密切配合，积极抓紧兑付。到１月底，全省欠农民的售粮款已基本兑现，让农民过一个愉快的春节。
