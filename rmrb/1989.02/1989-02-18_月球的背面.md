The dark side of the moon is a world of darkness! Ancient poets lacked this knowledge, and modern poets seem to have paid no attention to it. Whether the dark side of the moon is worth the attention of poets is a matter that need not be discussed, but the existence of that dark world is beyond doubt.

People are like the moon, and literary and artistic masters are also like the moon!

Recently, I read excerpts from Tolstoy's diary published in the newspapers, and suddenly saw the contradictory, painful, selfish, and even mad side of Tolstoy, who is surrounded by a halo of light. For example, he despised adultery but repeatedly had sexual relations with peasant girls or Gypsy girls; he hated fame and position but picked up the newspaper every day to see if his name was mentioned; he was deeply remorseful for his misdeeds but fell into the same traps over and over again, unable to free himself.

Reflecting on this, memories flooded back. In my early years, I read Rousseau's "Confessions" and saw Rousseau exposing his private life, desires, misdeeds, and vices without any concealment. The naked text made my young heart pound with surprise, and my head seemed to split open, leaving only a blank space. Later, I saw that Newton, who had once been grateful for the "stepping stone," envied his juniors and suppressed the publication of Gray's electrical theory. I saw that Chaplin, who had once denounced tyranny, could not tolerate a director more talented than himself, using his power as a producer to burn the only copy of "The Sea Woman." I was once again shocked and bewildered. Ah, the dark side of the moon, as black as ink and as cold as iron!

The seasons change, the sun and moon alternate, and the wind and rain wear away simplicity. Experience breeds maturity. Now it seems that the other side of the masters is nothing to be alarmed about. The reason for the alarm lies within ourselves. We treat the masters as perfect "saints," and we place halos of our own making on their heads. The destruction of the "most sacred and divine" causes our own thoughts to be disrupted. It should be said that the existence of the dark side of the masters is quite natural. The brave dare to reveal their dark side to the world, which precisely shows that they have never disguised themselves as gods or supermen. What they give to the readers is a naked human being. I especially admire Rousseau among them!

Turning my thoughts to the Chinese literary and artistic circle, are there people like Rousseau here? It seems rare, perhaps the early Guo Moruo and the late Yu Dafu who died in Southeast Asia come close. Read Guo Moruo's autobiography, in "Youth" he wrote about his masturbation, and in "Black Cat" he wrote about his sexual psychology. Yu Dafu's novels? Perhaps they can be seen as artistic autobiographies. In recent years, a number of writers and artists have written autobiographies or other memoirs, among which there are also brave people who pour out their hearts and souls, making readers admire their high spirits.

Unfortunately, a larger number of writings are disappointing. The most common and most tragic is the exaggeration of merits and the concealment of faults. Whether writing about oneself or others, it is all about passing through five passes and slaying six generals, as if there had never been a failure like the Battle of Maicheng. It seems that once famous, one flaw covers a hundred virtues, and from the moment one is born, one is a genius baby, with wisdom and virtue unmatched in the world, and even trivial hobbies become models. There are also fabrications, lies, stealing credit, covering up mistakes, and all kinds of things, treating words as rouge and powder. He has no dark side, he is a thousand times more noble than Rousseau!

Unfortunately, a moon without a dark side is just a circle, and it does not exist in space. Only when half of the sphere shines brightly and half is shrouded in darkness, is it a real moon. The existence of the dark side does not diminish the brightness of the moon. The full moon in the sky is still admired by people.

　　月球的背面
    郭启宏
    月球的背面是一个黑暗的世界！古代诗人固然缺乏这一知识，现代诗人似乎也不曾注目。当然，月球的背面值不值得诗人注目，无须探讨，然而那个黑暗世界的存在却毋庸置疑。
    人如月球，文学艺术大师亦如月球！
    近读报章披露的《托尔斯泰日记》片断，忽然看到为光环笼罩的托翁那矛盾、痛苦、自私甚至疯狂的一面。比如，他鄙弃私通，却又一再同农家女或吉普赛女孩发生性关系；他憎恨名位，却又每天抓起报纸先找一找有无自己的大名；他为自己的劣迹痛悔不已，却又屡蹈覆辙，无法解脱。
    掩卷思之，储存的记忆纷至沓来。早年间读卢梭《忏悔录》，看到卢梭将自己的阴私、邪欲、劣行、恶德毫不隐讳尽行“曝光”，那赤裸的文字曾使我少年之心怦然惊跳，脑袋恍惚轰然开裂，只余下一片空白。后来，看到那个曾经感激“人梯”的牛顿嫉妒晚辈，压制格雷的电学论文的发表，看到那个曾经痛诋强权的卓别林容不得才华胜过自己的导演，运用制片人的权力，焚毁唯一一部《海的女人》的拷贝，我也曾一次又一次震惊和惶惑。呵，黑如漆冷如铁的月球背面！
    春秋代序，日月递嬗，风雨磨洗了单纯，阅历酝酿着成熟。如今看来，对于大师们的另一面，我们大可不必惊惶。追寻惊惶的因由，原在我们自己，是我们把大师们当成一个个完美无缺的“圣人”，是我们将心造的光环罩在他们身上，“至圣至神”的轰毁引起我们自身思维的紊乱。应该说，大师们有自己的阴暗面原极自然，勇者敢于将阴暗面公诸世间，恰恰表明他从未把自己装扮成神或超人，他奉献给读者的是一个精赤条条的人。我尤其对他们之中的卢梭钦敬之至！
    浮思返回中国文艺界，这里也有如卢梭的么？看来寥寥，或许前期的郭沫若和遇难南洋的郁达夫差近。读一读郭沫若的自传，他在《少年时代》里写了他的自渎，在《黑猫》里写了他的性心理。郁达夫的小说呢？也许可以看作艺术化了的自传。近些年来，为数不少的作家艺术家纷纷写起自传或其他回忆文字，就中同样不乏勇毅之人，他们倾心吐胆，令读者仰其高风。
    遗憾的是更为大量的文字使人失望。最常见也最可悲的是溢美隐恶。无论述己还是写人，洋洋洒洒全是过五关斩六将，仿佛压根儿就不曾有过走麦城那桩事。又似乎一旦成名，一俊遮百丑，打从娘胎里出来便是天才大婴孩，灵根慧性，世无与匹，甚至无聊的嗜好也成了楷模。更有向壁虚造、信口雌黄、贪功窃誉、文过饰非种种，直把文字当作胭脂水粉。他没有阴暗面，他比卢梭高尚千万倍！
    可惜，没有背面的月球只是一个圆，在太空中并不存在。唯有半个球面熠熠生光，半个球面笼罩黑暗，才是一个真实的月球。阴暗面的存在，丝毫无损明月的清辉，那中天的一轮，依然为人们所仰望。
