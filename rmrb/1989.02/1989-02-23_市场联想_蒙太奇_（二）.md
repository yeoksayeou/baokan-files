Title: Market Association "Montage" (II)

		Most retailers have this experience: when certain goods do not sell well, especially clothing or fabrics, they let a few "clever" people push a flatbed cart to the streets to set up stalls, which often sell out quickly. Or they open a separate window, writing in large letters: "One-time price reduction," "Original price XX yuan, current price XX yuan." At that time, it would be crowded with customers.

		Now there is a "new" experience: a certain individual clothing vendor had a batch of trousers priced at 28 yuan each that were not selling. Others advised him to reduce the price, but he played a "trick" by adding a "zero" after the original price, making it 280 yuan per pair. Unexpectedly, they sold out quickly, and some people even asked: Are there any more trousers priced at 280 yuan each?

		The "shortage economy" sometimes stimulates panic buying. Many people "rush" to buy in a very blind and uninformed manner. During the three difficult years in the early 1960s, there was such a joke: an old lady would line up for any queue, only to find out it was for selling the "Red Flag" magazine. In 1984, at the beginning of urban reforms, there was a wave of "small-scale panic buying." Beijing rushed to buy eggs, Shanghai rushed to buy clothing, and Guangzhou rushed to buy jewelry. People in Guangzhou joked that Beijing people were really buying in an "uninformed" way. Even if they bought a hundred eggs, how much money would they save? If storage and spoilage are considered, it might not be worth it! In recent panic buying, the "level" gap between regions seems to have narrowed, but there are still many who buy blindly. Some "rush" to buy refrigerators that do not cool, some "rush" to buy fans that do not spin, and some even "rushed" to buy twelve spittoons at once... Unexpectedly, this saved some factories with poor product quality. People in Guangdong also rushed to buy salt, and this time it was the turn of northerners to joke about them.

		In recent years, the advertising industry has developed significantly, which is a necessity for the development of a commodity economy. However, the popularization of commodity knowledge is far from sufficient. Who will take the effort to do this work and enhance consumers' ability to identify commodities, which will be a great service to the people.

		There is also a topic in front of everyone: how to be a consumer in a commodity economy? And how to be a consumer when the commodity economy is not yet developed? This is also a subject worth studying.

　　市场联想“蒙太奇”（二）
    丛名仁
    大凡零售商，都有这样的经验：某些商品滞销了，特别是服装或布料，就让几个能“乍乎”的人，推着平板车去街头摆摊，往往一抢而光——推销出去了。或者单开一窗口，大字写上：“一次性降价处理”，“原价××元，现价××元”。那时，将挤满了顾客。
    现在又有了“新鲜”经验：某个体服装摊贩，有一批二十八元一条的裤子卖不出去，将砸在手里。别人劝他降价处理，他却搞了个“恶作剧”，在定价后边又加了一个“零”，每条二百八十元。没想到，竟然很快卖光，还有人来问：二百八十元一条的还有没有？
    “短缺经济”有时刺激了抢购。有相当多的人“抢”得相当盲目，“没水平”。六十年代初三年困难时期，有这样的笑话：老太太见队就排，排到头一看是卖《红旗》杂志的。一九八四年，城市改革之初，有一阵“小抢”，北京抢购鸡蛋，上海抢购服装，广州抢购首饰。广州人笑话北京人，真是抢得“不够水平”，就算抢一百斤鸡蛋能省多少钱？如果加上存放损坏，可能更不合算！前不久的抢购中，地区之间的“水平”差距似乎缩小了，但“抢”得盲目的也为数不少。有的“抢”不制冷的冰箱，有的“抢”不转的电扇，有的竟一下“抢”了十二个痰盂……没想到这下子救了一些产品质量低劣的厂家。广东人也有抢购食盐的，这下轮到北方人笑话他们了。
    近年来广告业大大发展，这是发展商品经济的必然。可是商品知识的普及却远远不够。谁来花气力做做这件事，增强消费者识别商品的能力，将是为人民服务的一件大好事。
    摆在每个人面前的还有这么一个课题：怎样做商品经济条件下的消费者？还有：怎样做商品经济还不发达条件下的消费者？这也算一门学问。
