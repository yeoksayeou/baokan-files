The car slowly drove onto the Istanbul Bridge, and from the window, I saw the Bosphorus Strait again. Every time this happens, my heart is filled with excitement. I have been to Istanbul five times and have a special affection for it because during my first visit, I swam across the Bosphorus Strait alone.

That day, I arrived in Istanbul for the first time, and its grandeur and prosperity left me in awe. However, what attracted me the most was the Bosphorus Strait, known as the "dividing line" between Asia and Europe. From a distance, it looked like a light blue silk ribbon, gently flowing and dividing the city into two parts: the southern side is the Asian part, and the northern side is the European part of Istanbul.

The magnificent scenery did not make me lose myself in admiration. Instead, a strong desire to conquer it suddenly arose in my mind, "I want to swim across the strait, I want to swim from Asia to Europe." After a night of thought, I finally decided to try it the next morning.

On the morning of August 25, everything was ready. From the map of the strait, I decided to cross at a point three kilometers east of the bridge. There is a small pier here, with many small yachts moored at the shore. I boarded a small white boat and greeted the locals sitting on the deck drinking tea in English. Then, I handed them a note I had written in Turkish, which said, "I want to swim across the strait. Could you please take your boat to accompany me and put my clothes on your boat?" The boat owner was a sturdy Turkish youth with a big beard. He readily agreed with a simple "OK."

At 11:20 AM, I dove into the sea. This was my first time swimming in the sea, and as soon as I touched the water, the coldness was overwhelming. Looking north towards the European continent—my destination—it was hidden in a layer of clouds, appearing and disappearing. Could I really swim across? As if reading my mind, my friend on the boat said, "You have to swim across, don't let people say that Chinese people are cowards." I immediately made up my mind: I must swim to Europe! Not only for myself but also to prove something for the Chinese people. I kicked off with all my might and charged forward...

After swimming for about fifteen minutes, I turned back to look. The houses, streets, and cars driving along the southern shore were still clearly visible, like a shrunken color picture. Looking ahead, the European continent seemed no closer. But at this moment, I had lost my tension and became excited, swimming forward with all my strength.

"Hey, you're swimming off course," my friend on the boat shouted. I wiped the water from my hair and face and looked carefully. Unknowingly, I had swum to the center of the strait. Looking west, the magnificent Istanbul Bridge was right in front of me, like a suspended steel wall flying over the Bosphorus Strait; looking at the sides of the strait, hundreds of various yachts and sailboats with colorful flags were neatly moored in the harbor. Further away, the undulating hills between the shores were dotted with many uniquely designed and modern villas, red and yellow, hidden among the greenery, like flowers blooming in the green. Istanbul, you are indeed a perfect blend of natural and artificial beauty!

The small boat was always ahead, clearing the way for me. The Asian continent was far behind me. Although I felt tired, my confidence grew, "I must not let my efforts go to waste." I kept encouraging myself.

The European continent was getting closer. People walking on the seaside path on the opposite shore all stopped to watch me—a Chinese person! Some were surprised, and some were amazed. I sped up, rushing towards the shore, fifty meters, twenty meters, five meters, one meter, finally touching the concrete steps of the seawall! I grabbed the rusty handrail and used all my strength to climb up the "European continent." Perhaps it was the joy of victory that made me ecstatic, or perhaps it was the relaxation after the struggle. As soon as I landed, I knelt on the ground, silently cheering: I succeeded! After forty-five minutes of struggle, I finally realized my wish.

Five minutes later, the boat took me back to Asia from Europe along the original route. Standing on the deck, facing the sea breeze, I was filled with a sense of pride. Any difficulty in the world seems so small in the face of people's determination and will.

Later, a local told me that he had often seen in the newspapers that many Westerners and Japanese had swum across the Bosphorus Strait, but he had never heard of a Chinese person doing so. "You are the first!"

　　从亚洲游到欧洲
　　魏同超
    汽车缓缓开上伊斯坦布尔大桥，从车窗外又看到了博斯普鲁斯海峡。每当此时，我的心中总是十分激动。我曾五次来过伊斯坦布尔，对它有一种特殊的感情，因为我第一次经过伊市时，曾只身横渡了博斯普鲁斯海峡。
    那天我初次来到伊斯坦布尔，它那雄伟气势、繁荣景象令我惊叹不已。但最吸引我的还是被称为亚欧“分水岭”的博斯普鲁斯海峡，从远处望去，它像一条浅蓝色的丝绸带，舒展地飘动着，将伊市一分为二，南侧是亚洲部分，北部则是伊斯坦布尔的欧洲部分。
    壮观的景色没有使我陶醉于欣赏中，相反，一股强大的征服欲突然在我头脑中产生了，“我要游过海峡，我要从亚洲游到欧洲去。”经过一夜的思考，我终于决定第二天上午去试一试。
    八月二十五日清晨，一切准备就绪。我从海峡地形图上决定在大桥以东三公里处渡海。这里是个小码头，许多小游艇停靠在岸边。我登上一条乳白色的小艇，向坐在甲板上喝茶的当地人用英语问候，然后把早已用土耳其文字写好的纸条递给他，内容大意是：“我想游过海峡，能否请您开小艇陪伴我，并把我的衣服放在您的船上。”船主是个留着大胡子，身体健壮的土耳其青年，他很干脆地说了声“ＯＫ”。
    上午十一点二十分，我扑进大海怀抱。这是我第一次在海里游泳，一接触到海水，凉气逼人。北眺欧洲大陆——我的目的地，躲在一片云雾里，若隐若现。真的能游过去吗？好像猜透了我的心思似的，船上的朋友向我说了：“你可要游过去啊，别让人家说中国人是孬种。”我随即暗下决心，非游到欧洲不可！不仅为自己，也是为中国人争口气。我使劲一蹬水，冲了出去……
    向前游了一刻钟，我掉头回望，南岸的房屋，街道以及沿岸行驶的汽车仍然清晰可见，像是一张缩印了的彩色图画。向前看，欧洲大陆距我的位置似乎没有改变。但此时，我已消除了紧张感，兴奋起来，奋力划水前进。
    “嗨，游偏方向了。”船上的朋友喊话。我抹一把头发上和脸上的水，定睛一看，不知不觉我已游到海峡中心了。向西看，雄伟的伊斯坦布尔大桥近在眼前，它像一座悬浮在空中的钢铁长城，飞跨于博斯普鲁斯海峡之上；再看海峡两侧，成百上千条悬挂彩旗的各式游艇和帆船整齐安静地停泊在港湾内，再向远处看，两岸起伏的山峦中间零零散散地点缀着许多设计别致，造型新颖的别墅，红色的，黄色的，隐现在一片绿荫之中，好似绿丛中盛开的花朵。伊斯坦布尔，你真是自然美与人工美巧妙融汇的典范！
    小艇一直在前为我开路。亚洲大陆已被我远远抛在身后了。我虽然感到了疲惫，但信心倍增，“绝不能前功尽弃”，我不断激励着自己。
    欧洲大陆越来越近了。对岸海边人行路上散步的人们都停下脚步，注视着我——一个中国人！有的惊讶，有的赞叹。我加快速度，向岸边冲刺，五十米，二十米，五米，一米，终于摸到海堤的水泥台阶了！我抓着生了锈的扶梯使尽全身力气，一步步“登上了欧洲”。也许是胜利的喜悦使我陶醉，也许是经过拚搏后精神上的轻松，一上岸，我便跪倒在地上，心里默默地欢呼着：我成功了！经过四十五分钟的搏斗，我终于实现了自己的愿望。
    五分钟后，小艇载着我从欧洲按原路回到了亚洲。站在甲板上，迎着海风，我心中充满了自豪感。世上的任何艰难险阻，在人们的决心和意志面前都显得那么渺小。
    后来当地人告诉我，过去常从报纸看到不少西方人、日本人游过博斯普鲁斯海峡的消息，但从来没听说过有中国人游过这个海峡的。“你是第一个呢！”
