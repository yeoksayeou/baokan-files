A circuit board composed of 60-plus integrated circuit blocks, cleverly designed and inserted into a domestically produced IBM-PC series microcomputer, can endow the machine with image processing capabilities. This achievement is the result of half a year's work by a team of seven, led by 36-year-old returned scholar and associate professor Zheng Nanning of Xi'an Jiaotong University. This is the fifth achievement Zheng Nanning has presented since his return to China in October 1985.

The use of computer image processing technology can be widely applied in scientific research and industrial production. The new system developed by Zheng Nanning's team allows computers to "see," making it easy for people to use computers for rapid identification, recording, storage, and processing of various images.

The distinguishing feature of this new achievement, compared to similar domestic and international products, is its focus on future development in this field. It can capture fleeting dynamic scenes at will, has high resolution, and is compatible with various types of cameras. The accompanying software system also features a structured, modular design with a large capacity, making it easy to add, delete, or modify.

　　计算机长上“眼睛”　图像处理视觉系统在西安交大建成
    本报讯  一块由６０多个集成电路块巧妙构思组成的插板，插入国内通用的ＩＢＭ—ＰＣ系列微型计算机，就可使这种微机具备图像处理功能。这项成果是西安交通大学３６岁的留学归国博士郑南宁带领７人课题组，用半年时间完成的。这是郑南宁副教授１９８５年１０月回国后拿出的第五项成果。
    利用计算机处理图像技术，可广泛应用于科研和工业生产领域。郑南宁课题组研制的新系统，让计算机长上了“眼睛”，使人们利用计算机进行各种图像的快速识别、记录、储存、处理，变得轻而易举。
    这一新成果区别于国内外目前同类成果的最大特点是，着眼于该领域的发展，可任意捕捉瞬现即逝的动态景物，分辨率高，并能与多种类型的摄像机兼容。与之相配套的软件系统也具有结构化、模块化、容量大、便于增删修改等特点。
