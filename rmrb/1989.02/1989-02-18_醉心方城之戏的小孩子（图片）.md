These days, many adults often play mahjong to pass the time during holidays or after work. This is not a bad thing, but it is important not to engage in gambling. At the same time, adults should also advise children not to play mahjong and instead use more of their time and energy on their studies. For example, the children in the photograph who are so engrossed in playing mahjong should be stopped by their parents. Similarly, adults should also exercise restraint when playing mahjong.

    醉心方城之戏的小孩子
    时下，不少大人们常在节假日或工余时间打麻将消遣，这并非坏事，但切不可聚赌。同时，还应当劝戒孩子们，不要打麻将，把更多的时间和精力用在学习上。像照片上这几个孩子这样醉心方城之戏的玩法，家长们还是出面制止为好。同样，大人打麻将也要有所节制。
