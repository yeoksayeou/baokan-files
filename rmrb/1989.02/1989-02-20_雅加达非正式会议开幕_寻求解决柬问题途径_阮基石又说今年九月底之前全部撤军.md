The second informal meeting on the Cambodian issue opened at 5 p.m. (local time) today at the "Indonesia Hotel" in the center of Jakarta.

Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas presided over the opening ceremony. Representatives from the three factions of the Democratic Kampuchea—Prince Sihanouk's son and personal representative Ranariddh, Prime Minister of the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea Son Sann, and Vice-Chairman of the Democratic Kampuchea in charge of foreign affairs Khieu Samphan—attended the opening ceremony. The "Prime Minister" of the Phnom Penh regime backed by Vietnam, Hun Sen, and Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach also attended.

In addition, the foreign ministers of Laos, Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand also attended the opening ceremony. The 12 representatives sat around a round table in alphabetical order according to the first letter of their country or organization's name, with their secretaries and staff behind them. Approximately 300 Indonesian and foreign journalists came to cover the opening ceremony and the subsequent three-day "secret meeting."

In his opening remarks, Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas called on the relevant parties to the Cambodian issue to make efforts to find a solution to the problem that has dragged on for 10 years.

He reviewed the common points and unresolved differences that had been discussed since the first informal meeting in Jakarta last July.

He welcomed the international efforts to resolve the Cambodian issue.

According to Agence France-Presse, Nguyen Co Thach told reporters before the meeting opened today that if no agreement could be reached on the composition of Cambodia's future government, "Vietnam will also withdraw all its troops from Cambodia by midnight on September 30 this year."
