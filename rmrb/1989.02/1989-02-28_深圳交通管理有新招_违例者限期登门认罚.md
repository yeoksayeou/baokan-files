Shenzhen Implements New Traffic Management Measures: Violators Must Appear to Accept Penalties Within a Set Time

	Shenzhen will begin implementing a new set of traffic violation handling procedures starting March 1. The new regulations stipulate that for motor vehicles and drivers entering or exiting the region, as well as those within Shenzhen, who violate traffic regulations, a "Traffic Violation Notice" will be issued. Violators are required to appear at the Traffic Violation Handling Office or the relevant squad (sub-station) within 7 days to accept processing. If violators do not accept processing within the specified time, the Traffic Violation Handling Office (or squad) will issue a "Summons" to the violator. For motor vehicles and drivers entering or exiting the region who fail to appear for processing within 21 days, the Traffic Violation Handling Office will impound the violating vehicle, and the Man Kam To Vehicle Management Sub-Station will refuse to process renewal or annual inspection procedures. For violators who fail to appear for processing within 21 days, the relevant squad will impound the violating vehicle, and the Vehicle Management Office will refuse to process annual inspection procedures.

	It is reported that this new method of handling traffic violations is the first of its kind in the country.

　　深圳交通管理有新招
    违例者限期登门认罚
    本报深圳２月２７日电  深圳市将于３月１日起实行一套新的交通违例处理办法。该新法规定，对入出境的机动车及驾驶员和深圳市的机动车及驾驶员违反交通条例，发给“交通违例通知书”，限违例者７天内到处理交通违例办公室或各大队（分所）处理交通违例小组接受处理。限期内交通违例者不接受处理的，由处理交通违例办公室（或小组）向违例者发出“传呼证”。入出境机动车及驾驶员逾期２１天后不来接受处理的，由处理交通违例办公室执行扣留其违例车辆，并由文锦渡车管分所执行不给予办理续期加签及年检审手续。逾期２１天不接受处理的，由各大队处理交通违例小组执行扣留其违例车辆，并由车管科执行不给予办理年检手续。
    据称，这种新的交通违例处理方法，在国内尚属首创。
