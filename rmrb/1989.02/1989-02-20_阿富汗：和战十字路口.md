The Soviet troops have completed their withdrawal from Afghanistan on February 15. What will happen next in Afghanistan's domestic situation? Will the long-awaited peace finally arrive in this war-torn country with the departure of the Soviet troops? This has become a highly watched issue in international public opinion.

Observers generally believe that after the Soviet withdrawal, achieving peace in Afghanistan requires two indispensable conditions: domestically, national reconciliation must be achieved, and a new government with a broad base must be established; internationally, the Soviet Union and the United States must, in accordance with the Geneva Accords, truly assume their responsibilities for guaranteeing peace in Afghanistan. However, as things stand now, neither of these conditions has been met. Therefore, Afghanistan's chaotic situation may continue for some time, and the danger of civil war cannot be ruled out.

People remember that when the Geneva Accords were signed last April, all parties reached an understanding on the United Nations' proposed "dual-track" approach, which is to accelerate the establishment of a new government in Afghanistan while the Soviet troops withdraw. Now, the process of Soviet withdrawal has been completed, but the work of forming a government is proceeding slowly. What is the problem? It lies in whether or not the People's Democratic Party led by Najibullah should participate in the future government. The Soviet Union and the Kabul regime initially advocated for a coalition government with the People's Democratic Party as the main body. Later, seeing that this approach was not feasible, they made some concessions but still insisted that the party, as a political force, should participate in the government and share power with the various opposition groups. However, the resistance forces, led mainly by the Seven Party Alliance, refused to accept this proposal, insisting that the People's Democratic Party "hand over power" and only agreeing to absorb a small number of "upright Muslims" from the current government into the future government. The positions of both sides were diametrically opposed in the past and remain far apart today. Before the complete withdrawal of troops, the Soviet Union, in order to make necessary arrangements for the survival of the People's Democratic Party, conducted a series of intense diplomatic activities, including direct dialogue with the resistance forces, consultations with relevant countries, and talks with the former Afghan king Zahir Shah. However, until the troops were completely withdrawn, the stalemate over the formation of a new government had not been broken. From the current situation, it seems that the Soviet Union and the Kabul side find it difficult to make further concessions, while it is also not easy for the resistance forces to make compromises. Therefore, it can be said that the new government in Afghanistan will not be established in the short term.

Facing the stalemate in the political settlement process, the opposing sides are preparing militarily and are ready to decide the outcome. The resistance forces have been strengthening their military actions, intensifying their offensives, and beginning to besiege and blockade major cities such as Kabul, preparing to defeat the Kabul regime militarily. Although the Kabul side has fallen into a difficult situation due to the withdrawal of Soviet troops, it has also made many preparations to deal with the resistance forces. On the one hand, it has strengthened and expanded its regular forces, and on the other hand, it has implemented widespread mobilization to form a considerable number of civilian defense forces. All of this indicates that in the coming period, Afghanistan is likely to see a direct military confrontation between the opposing sides.

In addition, both the Soviet Union and the United States have no intention of stopping military aid to the opposing sides in Afghanistan. The Soviet Union not only left a large amount of military equipment for the Kabul regime when it withdrew, but also stated that it would continue to provide military aid after the withdrawal; U.S. President Bush recently also publicly announced that as long as the Kabul regime supported by the Soviet Union continues to rule, the United States will continue to provide military aid to the resistance forces on principle. The military aid from the two superpowers undoubtedly increases the factors leading to civil war in Afghanistan.

Afghanistan, which has just freed itself from Soviet military occupation, is now at a crossroads between peace and civil war. How to stop the civil war and achieve peace is a real issue facing all political forces in Afghanistan, and it also requires beneficial efforts from the international community, especially from the Soviet Union and the United States, which are participating in international guarantees. It should be said that the complete withdrawal of Soviet troops and the current international situation have provided favorable conditions for achieving peace in Afghanistan; the Afghan people, who have suffered a decade of war, universally detest war and oppose fratricide; moreover, past experience has proven that the Afghan issue cannot be solved by military means and can only be resolved through political means. People hope that the various political forces in Afghanistan will make choices that are in line with their national interests.

　　阿富汗：和战十字路口
    史宗星
    苏联军队已于２月１５日全部撤离了阿富汗。接下来，阿富汗国内局势将会怎样发展？人们期待已久的和平会不会随着苏军的撤离降临这个饱经战乱的山国？就成了国际舆论十分关注的一个问题。
    观察家们一般认为，苏联撤军之后在阿富汗实现和平，有两个条件是必不可少的：在国内，须实现民族和解，建立起一个具有广泛基础的新政府；在国际上，则需要苏联和美国按照日内瓦协议，真正担负起对阿富汗和平的保证责任。然而，就目前情况来看，这两个条件都还不具备。因此，阿富汗的动乱局面很可能持续一段时间，甚至不能排除内战的危险。
    人们记得，去年４月日内瓦协议签字时，各方曾就联合国建议的“双轨并进”方案达成了谅解，即在苏军撤离的同时，加快建立阿富汗新政府的步伐。眼下，苏联撤军的进程已经完结，但组建政府的工作步履蹒跚。症结在哪里？在于要不要纳吉布拉的人民民主党参加未来的政府。苏联和喀布尔政权先是主张以人民民主党为主体组建联合政府，后见此路不通，就作了某些让步，但仍坚持该党作为一派政治力量参加执政，与各反对派“分享权力”。而以七党联盟为主的抵抗力量拒不接受这一主张，坚持要人民民主党“交出权力”，只同意吸收少量现政权中的“正直的穆斯林”参加未来政府。双方的立场过去是针锋相对，今日依然相去甚远。苏联在全部撤军前夕，为了给人民民主党的生存作出必要安排，开展了一场紧张的外交活动，同抵抗力量直接对话，同有关国家进行磋商，还同阿富汗前国王查希尔举行了会谈。然而直到撤军完毕之时，组建新政府问题上的僵局依然没能打破。从目前的情况看来，苏联和喀布尔方面似很难再作让步，而要抵抗力量作出妥协也并非易事。因此可以说，阿富汗的新政府短期内还无法建立起来。
    面对政治解决进程中的僵持局面，对立双方正在军事上蓄势以待，摆开了决一雌雄的架式。抵抗力量不断加强，军事行动，强化攻势，并开始对喀布尔等大城市实行围困封锁，准备从军事上打垮喀布尔政权。喀布尔方面虽因苏军撤走而陷于困境，但也作了不少对付抵抗力量的准备，一方面充实加强了正规部队，一方面实行广泛动员，组成了人数可观的民防队伍。这一切表明，未来的一段时间，阿富汗似乎难免出现敌对双方直接军事对抗的局面。
    此外，苏联和美国都不打算停止对阿富汗敌对双方的军事援助。苏联不仅在撤军时为喀布尔政权留下了大量军事装备，而且表示撤军之后将继续提供军援；美国新任总统布什最近也公开宣布，只要苏联支持的喀布尔政权继续执政，美国就将原则上继续向抵抗力量提供军援。两个超级大国的军事援助，无疑增加了阿富汗发生内战的因素。
    刚刚摆脱了苏联军事占领的阿富汗，正处在和平与内战的十字路口。怎样才能制止内战，实现和平，是摆在阿富汗各派政治力量面前的现实的课题，也需要来自国际社会，特别是参加国际保证的苏联和美国作出有益的努力。应该说，苏联军队的全部撤走和当前的国际形势，为在阿富汗实现和平提供了有利条件；饱尝１０年战争苦难的阿富汗人民也普遍地厌恶战争，更反对骨肉相残；而且，以往的经验已经证明，阿富汗问题不可能靠军事手段解决，只能走政治解决的路子。人们希望阿富汗各派政治力量作出符合自己民族利益的选择。
