	On Telling the Truth Again
	Huang Zongjiang

	In the middle of the night, I came up with a half-formed idea: people should value telling the truth. Actually, this topic has been written about many times before. Ba Jin has already written one, two, and three essays on telling the truth. I am using it again, not by chance. Reflecting on it, almost all the works I have written since the Cultural Revolution are related to this theme. This can also be said to be a major "central theme" of contemporary times. With this thought, I told my wife, but she said, "Don't say it, don't write it." She showed me an article in the February 8 issue of the People's Daily that reviewed my old friend Huang Shang's book "A History of Pen Disasters," asking me to read it carefully. Actually, Huang Shang had already given me this book, and I had already read it thoroughly, even without reading it. I understand that this history of pen disasters is a history of the blood and tears of scholars, a history of beheadings. But scholars of past dynasties were not unaware of the dangers, yet there were still many who sent their heads to the executioner. I do not want to die like that, and I also know that today—after the Cultural Revolution and the Third Plenum—no one will die like that. Of course, telling the truth is not without some lingering fears, without some objective and subjective considerations. I still chattered on in front of my wife, even wanting to make these private thoughts public.

	Here, I will only mention a recent incident related to myself. Last year, I went to Nanjing to participate in the international academic conference marking the 100th anniversary of the birth of American playwright Eugene O'Neill. In front of Chinese and foreign scholars, I made a short speech, and in a Shanghai newspaper, I published a short article, honestly admitting that I had also criticized O'Neill in the past, which was during the Korean War, and was quite natural. My current understanding is that O'Neill values "deep truth, truthful depth," "truthfully and deeply facing life, penetrating to the bone, or one might say truly 'touching the soul.'" At the conference, I happened to meet a reporter from a certain Shanghai newspaper. We had a heart-to-heart talk, and after that, I did not see him mention O'Neill, but in the Literary Gazette, he published a short article titled "Huang Zongjiang Still Remembers Zhang Zihua," about 300 words in length, which was mostly true: it said that after the Zhang Zihua case was made public, I wrote a film script, and several directors wanted to shoot it but failed, although no one openly opposed it. It also mentioned that I extended the discussion to Ba Jin's proposal to build a Cultural Revolution Museum and Shao Yanxiang's proposal to establish Cultural Revolution studies, so that the Chinese people would not forget the lessons, but these have not been realized, which is still due to some people's fear of mentioning the Cultural Revolution and unwillingness to completely deny the Cultural Revolution. This short article of about 300 words, as far as I know, was reprinted by six or seven newspapers and magazines, including Hong Kong and Taiwan editions. The Zhang Zihua incident is no longer news, and someone like me is not a news figure, so such a response is naturally due to my mentioning Zhang Zihua again. Now, Zhou Yang, who has been bedridden for a long time and cannot speak, once said: Zhang Zihua is a brilliant communist, her heart has three and four—three is the Third Plenum, four is the Four Cardinal Principles, but she did not have the fortune to experience these, but she possessed the spirit that can combine the two. In that terrifying time of universal silence, she said: "The great achievements of Comrade Mao Zedong cannot be denied, but in his later years, he made Stalin-like mistakes..." and so on. Later generations want to re-examine the Cultural Revolution, to re-examine Zhang Zihua, simply because they want to use the spirit of Zhang Zihua, who dared to tell the truth, to either summon her soul or drive away ghosts.

	All is past! Throughout history, there have been countless figures who are loved and respected, straightforward like Zhang Fei and Li Kui... elegant like Qu Yuan, Sima Qian, Li Zhi, and Lu Xun... all valued for their truth. Throughout history, countless works like "Lament for the South," "Records of the Grand Historian," and Lu Xun's miscellaneous essays... all value truth. Truth is not necessarily right, but it must first be true to see if it is right. Truth may not be the truth, but the truth must be true. Having reason, benefit, and propriety is good, but in the moment of speaking frankly, who can think of all these things? Thinking too much may make it impossible to be true! If a scholar does not have truth, it is the greatest immorality.

	Regarding the definition of democracy and freedom, there must also be a hundred schools of thought, not just two. Can we say in plain language: if the people can tell the truth, then democracy and freedom are realized, and the country can truly be prosperous and the people can truly be at peace.

	Writing to this point, there is no elegance, just old clichés; but I believe that there will still be many old and young actors who will discuss telling the truth a hundred times and a thousand times. On this point, I am optimistic, but not entirely, happy or sad, let's see. I have stopped writing, but I thought of my wife again. She has always been my first reader. This time, should I show it to her first?... I showed it to her, and she remained silent without speaking, but she did not seem to want to distance herself from me, so I am not afraid, and I will publish it as is.

	Unexpectedly, when I "published" it to the editorial department, the editorial department did not "publish" it in the newspaper. It is said that the reason is that it involves the "Cultural Revolution," and it is best not to discuss it. Recently, I saw Wang Li discussing the "Cultural Revolution" in the newspaper. My fame is certainly not as great as Wang Li's, but my civil rights are not less than Wang Li's. If he can discuss it, I think I can too, so I "published" it again, and let's see if the editor of "Earth" will publish it.

### 再论再论说真话

专栏：

　　再论再论说真话
    黄宗江
    夜半，偶得半题：人贵在说真话之类；其实这类题目早就有人作而又作了，巴金师以说真话为题就写过了一论二论三论……我再用之，亦非出于偶然。深思之，自己在文革后所写作品几乎都与这一主题有关，此亦可以说是当代一大“中心主题”了。以此念告老伴，她却说：“别说了，别写了。”并向我出示《人民日报》８版所载评介我老友黄裳著《笔祸史谈丛》的文章，要我细读。其实黄裳早就赠我此书，我早就通读，甚至不读也通的。我懂得这一部笔祸史是一部文人的血泪史，一部断头史；但历朝历代的文人也不是不晓利害的，却偏偏仍常有人把头颅送上。我是不想这样死的，我也知道今天——文革后、三中全会后的今天是不会这样死去的。当然，说真话还不是毫无余悸，毫无主客观使然的杂念的。我仍在老伴前叨叨不休，甚至想把这些私房话公之于世。
    这里我只提一件最近发生的和自己有关的小事。去年我去南京参加了美国剧作家奥尼尔百年诞辰的国际学术会议，在中洋学者面前发了一次短言，在上海一报纸上发了一篇小文，老老实实地招认自己过去也批判过奥尼尔，那是在抗美援朝之际，亦属理所当然的；我当前的认识则是：奥尼尔贵在追求“深刻的真实，真实的深刻”，“真实而又真实地直面人生，深入骨髓，或可说是真正地‘触及灵魂’也。”在会上偶识上海某报一记者，一见交心地相互乱扯了一通，别后未见他只字提及奥尼尔，却在《文学报》上发了一篇《黄宗江依然不忘张志新》短短数百字的报道，大致如实：说我在张志新案公布后，写了电影剧本，好几位导演欲拍未遂，虽亦无人公开反对云云。又道我引申地说了巴金倡建文革博物馆，邵燕祥倡建文革学，以使国人不忘教训，亦均未能有所建，这些还是由于有些人怕提文革，不愿彻底否定文革云云。这短短数百字发表后，据我所见所知便有六七家报刊以至港台版作为文摘转载了。张志新事早非新闻，区区如我更不属于什么新闻人物，如此呼应当然是由于我再一次提起了张志新。现在也已经久卧病榻说不出话来了的周扬同志说过：张志新是一位光芒万丈的共产党人，她胸中既有三且有四——三者三中全会，四者四个坚持，而这三和四她都无幸赶上，然而她却具备这可以合二为一的精神了。她在那恐怖的万家墨面的年月就说过：“毛泽东同志的丰功伟绩不容否认，但他晚年犯了斯大林式的错误……”等等等等。后人愿意重提文革，重提张志新，无非是想借助敢说真话的张志新的亡灵或招魂或打鬼也。
    俱往矣！千古多少令人爱煞敬煞的人物，粗直如张飞、李逵……斯文如屈原、司马迁、李贽、鲁迅……均贵在其真；千古多少文章如离骚、史记、鲁迅杂文……无不贵在其真。真不一定就对，然必须首先出之以真，方能见其对否。真未必就是真理，然真理必真。有理有利有节固好，但直言无讳的时刻哪又顾得了这许多？顾多了也就可能真不了啦！文人如无真则是最大的无行。
    关于民主自由的定义，当也有百家说法，绝非仅是两家。可否也一句白话以蔽之曰：能让百姓说真话，也就实现民主自由了，也就反而能够真正地国泰民安了。
    行文至此，了无风华，老生常谈耳；但我相信还会有多少位老生小旦百论千论说真话。在这一点上，我是乐观的，又不尽然，乐乎悲乎，且观之。停笔矣，乃又想到老伴，她从来是我的第一读者，这一回给不给她先看呢？……还是给她看了，沉默未语，但也不像是要和我划清界限的样子，我也就不怕，照发。
    不料，我“照发”编辑部，编辑部却未“照发”报端。据说，其原因是牵涉到“文革”，最好不谈。近见王力在报上大谈“文革”，我的知名度当然不及王力，但公民权丝毫不比王力少。他谈得，想来我也谈得的，于是，又“照发”了去，且看《大地》编辑照发否？
