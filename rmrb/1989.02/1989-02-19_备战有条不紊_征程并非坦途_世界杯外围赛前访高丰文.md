The World Cup qualifiers for China's national team are imminent. The team is currently stationed in Guangzhou, and after interviewing head coach Gao Fengwen, the reporter felt that the team's preparations are proceeding smoothly.

	The Real Rivals Are Not Just Iran

The opponents in the group stage for China are Bangladesh, Thailand, and Iran. Some experts believe that the view of Iran as the sole formidable opponent while dismissing the other two teams as weak is not realistic.

Gao Fengwen agrees with this view. He said, "Bangladesh is a team on the rise. In last year's Asian Cup qualifiers, they drew with Iran and Hong Kong, and defeated North Korea. How can we say they are weak? Thailand has strengthened their team by recalling players who play abroad. Based on past experience, playing in Thailand is very difficult for any team. Iran is perceived as strong, but if we prepare well, we should be able to handle them in real matches."

	The Lunar New Year Cup Provides Insights for Team Optimization

The Lunar New Year Cup in Hong Kong was an important warm-up for China's qualifiers. Gao Fengwen believes that the three matches achieved the goal of preparation. The main purpose was to adjust the team's structure, which involved changing the positions of players in different lines, further understanding the characteristics and conditions of the players, and providing a basis for 'optimizing the combination.' In different matches, Sun Xianlu, Wu Qunli, Guo Yijun, and Mai Chao had different positions, and Duan Ju even played as a left-back. These were all attempts for new tactical ideas.

China's three matches all ended in 0-0 draws. Why didn't they score more goals? Gao Fengwen believes that this involves a factor like 'inspiration' in writing. He said, "In the Asian Cup, China's six goals were said to be brilliant, but in fact, not every goal was certain."

	Improving Tactical Coordination During Preparation

After returning from Hong Kong, the Chinese team analyzed the three matches in detail, focusing on technical and tactical aspects. The preparation training emphasized maintaining physical condition for the big match, clarifying each person's responsibilities, improving tactical coordination, and determining the starting lineup.

After analyzing the situation of the opponents and the team, Coach Gao Fengwen said: "The Chinese team will strive towards its set goals. We have the confidence to play well in the World Cup qualifiers. But this process will not be smooth. We prefer to consider more difficulties."

　　备战有条不紊　征程并非坦途   
    ——世界杯外围赛前访高丰文
    世界杯外围赛中国队所在小组开赛迫在眉睫。中国足球队目前屯兵广州，记者采访主教练高丰文后感到，中国队的备战工作有条不紊。
    　　　　劲敌不只是伊朗队
    小组预赛中国队的对手是孟加拉国、泰国和伊朗三个队。有行家认为，那种光把伊朗队看成危险劲敌、其他两队不堪一击的观点不符合现实。
    高丰文同意这种看法。他说，孟加拉国队是一支进步中的队伍，去年亚洲杯预赛上曾战平伊朗、香港队，战胜朝鲜队，怎能说实力很弱？泰国队为打外围赛调兵遣将加强实力，召回了在外国踢球的尖子。根据以往经验，泰国队在本土比赛，任何队要取胜都非常困难。而伊朗队给人的印象是比较强，但如果我们准备充足些，实战中也未必会出大问题。
    　　　　贺岁杯赛为优化组合提供依据
    香港贺岁杯赛是中国队外围赛前的一次重要练兵。高丰文认为，中国队的三场比赛达到了练兵的目的。主要是比赛中队伍内部结构调整，牵动了三线队员的位置，进一步了解了队员的特点和状况，为“优化组合”提供了依据。贺岁杯赛孙贤禄、吴群立、郭亿军、麦超在不同的场次中位置都有不同的变化，段举还一度司职左后卫，这些都是为新战术设想所作的尝试。
    中国队三场比赛均为０∶０，为什么不少该进的球不进？对此，高丰文认为，这当中有一个如写文章的“灵感”这样的因素。他说，亚洲杯赛上中国队的６个进球有人说球球精彩，事实上也不是每次都很有把握的。
    　　　　备战中改进战术配合
    从香港回来后，中国队对三场比赛从技术、战术上作了认真细致的分析、总结。备战训练着重保持身体状态适应大赛，明确每个人的职责，改进战术配合，从而确定主力阵容。
    在分析了对手及本队的情况后，高丰文教练说：“中国队将向着自己的既定目标努力。我们有信心打好世界杯外围赛。但这过程不可能顺利。我们宁愿把困难考虑多一点。”
