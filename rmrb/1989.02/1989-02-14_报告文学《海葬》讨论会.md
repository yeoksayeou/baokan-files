On February 11, the *Wenyi Bao* (Literary Gazette) and the editorial department of *Jiefangjun Wenyi* (Liberation Army Literature) jointly held a discussion on the reportage literature "Sea Burial – A Centennial Commemoration of the Establishment of the Qing Dynasty's Beiyang Navy," recently published by Qian Gang in the first issue of *Jiefangjun Wenyi*.

Participants in the meeting included experts in modern Chinese history and military history, writers, and critics, totaling more than 30 people.

The attendees believed that "Sea Burial" has opened up new realms in the subject matter of reportage literature. It not only artistically recreates the history of the rise and fall of China's modern navy but also infuses it with a sense of national destiny and reflections on contemporary reforms, making it a vivid textbook of modern history that awakens people.

Everyone praised the author for being able to absorb new academic achievements in modern history research and re-evaluate the Self-Strengthening Movement and its representative figure Li Hongzhang from a positive perspective, demonstrating a bold yet rigorous scientific spirit.

The author's thoughts on naval warfare, the ocean, and sea power also attracted the attention of the attendees. Everyone believed that these thoughts further broaden people's cultural horizons and thinking spaces.

The attendees also analyzed the work's characteristics, such as combining macro-level grasp with vivid detailed descriptions, and achieving a relatively harmonious unity of ideological depth, artistic quality, historical context, and contemporary relevance.

    大家赞扬作者能吸取近代史研究的新的学术成果，从积极意义上重新评价洋务运动及其代表人物李鸿章，表现出了大胆而又严谨的科学精神。
    作者对海战、海洋、海权的思考也引起了与会者的关注，大家认为这种思考进一步开拓了人们的文化视野和思维空间。
