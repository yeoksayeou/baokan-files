Dear readers,

Today is the Lantern Festival. We wish you a prosperous New Year and all the best in everything you do.

Since July 2, 1986, when our newspaper proposed to reform its work, we have made some efforts and achieved some progress. The amount of information we disseminate has increased, the openness of our reporting has improved, and our news writing and page layout have been enhanced. However, we still have a long way to go to achieve the goal we set two and a half years ago: to leverage our strengths, maximize reader satisfaction, and develop our unique characteristics in both content and form, making our newspaper readable, trustworthy, and approachable, truly becoming a friend and confidant to our readers.

We are determined to continue pushing forward with news reforms in an active and cautious manner, better fulfilling the functions of a central party newspaper, and making the People's Daily a more beloved newspaper among the people.

To adapt to the reform situation and meet the needs of our readers, starting today, our newspaper will make some adjustments to its layout. The main changes are as follows: the first four pages will focus on domestic and international news (Page 1 for domestic and international headlines, Page 2 for domestic news, Page 3 for international news, and Page 4 for cultural life, social life, and sports), providing readers with the latest information from various angles; the last four pages will feature various special sections (Page 5 for domestic special pages, Page 6 for theory, literary criticism, literary works, reader letters, documents, reports, and memoirs, Page 7 for international special pages, and Page 8 for supplements and weekly digests), offering readers various knowledge, insights, and discussions.

After adjusting the layout, we will further increase the amount of information, expand the scope of reporting, strengthen commentary and in-depth reporting, better reflect the voices of the people, and play a stronger role in public supervision, making the newspaper more closely aligned with the people and their lives. To include as much content as possible within the limited space and improve the readability of the newspaper, we will break some conventions in the selection and editing of news and articles, and explore some innovative approaches. We hope that our innovations will be understood and supported by all parties.

### 新春致读者

第1版(要闻)
专栏：

　　新春致读者
    亲爱的读者：
    今天是农历元宵节，谨祝新春大吉，万事如意。
    本报自１９８６年７月２日提出改革报纸工作以来，作了一些努力，也取得了一些进步。报上传播的信息有所增多，报道的开放程度有所提高，新闻写作和版面编排也有所改进，但是距我们在两年半以前提出的“发挥自己的优势，最大限度地满足读者需要，而且从内容到形式，都办出自己的特色来，使读者感到可读、可信、可亲，真正成为他们的益友和知音”这一目标，还有相当距离。我们决心积极而审慎地继续把新闻改革向前推进，更好地发挥党中央机关报的功能，使《人民日报》成为更受人民喜爱的报纸。
    为了适应改革的形势和满足读者的需要，本报从今天起对版面作一些调整。主要是前四个版集中刊登国内外新闻（一版国内外要闻，二版国内新闻，三版国际新闻，四版文化生活和社会生活、体育），向读者提供各方面的最新信息；后四个版是各种专刊（五版国内专页，六版理论、文艺评论、文学作品、读者来信、文件、报告、回忆录，七版国际专页，八版副刊、每周文摘），向读者提供各种知识、见解和议论。在调整版面后，我们将进一步增加信息量，扩大报道面，加强评论和深层次报道，更多地反映人民群众的声音，更好地发挥舆论监督的作用，使报纸更加贴近群众，贴近生活。为了要在有限的篇幅刊载尽可能多的内容，提高报纸的可读性，我们在新闻和文章的选择和编辑方面将打破一些成规，进行一些开拓创新的探索。希望我们的革新能得到各方面的理解和支持。
