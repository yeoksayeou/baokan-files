	150 Women Hold Key Positions in U.S. State Governments
	People's Daily, Washington, February 26 (Reported by Zhang Qixun) Since the 1980s, the trend of women holding key positions in U.S. state governments has been on the rise.

	In 1981, only 70 women held key positions in state governments. This number has now increased to 150, accounting for 21.3% of the total key positions in the 50 state governments across the United States. The chairman of the National Women's Political Caucus, Nadine V. Smith, believes that this trend can be attributed to two main factors: first, more women are now involved in election activities and hold important positions within these campaigns, and governors often select government officials from among them; second, governors have realized that to secure re-election, they need the support of female voters, and thus need to include women in the state government. Currently, the state with the highest number of women holding key positions is Virginia, where women account for approximately 42.8% of the total key positions in the state government.

　　美１５０名妇女在州府任要职
    本报华盛顿２月２６日电  记者张启昕报道：８０年代以来，美国妇女在州政府里担任要职的趋势逐渐上升。
    １９８１年，只有７０名妇女担任州政府要职，目前已上升到１５０名，占全美５０个州政府要员总数的２１．３％。全美妇女政治核心小组主席纳第维达认为，这种趋势的出现有两方面原因：一是现在有更多的妇女从事竞选活动，并在竞选活动中担任重要职务，州长们常常从她们中间挑选政府要员；二是州长们认识到，要争取连任，需要借助妇女选民的支持，因而需要吸收妇女进入州政府。目前，妇女在州政府担任要员人数最多的是弗吉尼亚州，约占州政府要员总数的４２．８％。
