	20 NPC Standing Committee Members Suggest Stopping the Broadcast of "Transformers"

	Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 18 (Reporter Heping) The animated series "Transformers," which is popular among teenagers on television screens, was criticized today by Hu Dewu and 20 other members of the Standing Committee of the Seventh National People's Congress.

	These members, during the sixth session of the Standing Committee of the Seventh National People's Congress, spoke out, believing that the ideological content of "Transformers" is absurd, mainly promoting militarism, and having a harmful effect on the next generation.

	It is reported that recently, some television stations have broadcasted the American animated series "Transformers," and some publishing houses have also published "Transformers" picture books. Meanwhile, "Transformers" children's toys, which are stagnant in the U.S. market, have been dumped in large quantities into the Chinese market. A set of "Transformers" can cost thousands of yuan, and each toy costs tens to hundreds of yuan, causing a financial burden for many families.

	Therefore, Hu Dewu and other members suggested: relevant television stations and publishing houses should stop broadcasting and publishing "Transformers," and departments importing "Transformers" toys should learn from this lesson and strictly inspect imported toys.

　　２０位人大常委建议停播《变形金刚》
    新华社北京２月１８日电  （记者何平）在电视屏幕上颇受青少年青睐的动画片《变形金刚》，今天受到胡德华等２０位全国人大常委会委员的批评。
    这些委员在七届全国人大常委会六次会议上发言，认为《变形金刚》的思想内容荒谬，主要是宣传好战，对下一代有毒害作用。
    据悉，最近一些电视台播放了美国动画片《变形金刚》，有的出版社还出版了《变形金刚》画册。与此同时，在美国市场滞销的“变形金刚”儿童玩具大量倾销我国市场，一套“变形金刚”价格高达上千元，每一个玩具也要数十元到上百元，给许多家庭造成经济负担。
    为此，胡德华等委员提出：有关电视台、出版社应停播、停止出版《变形金刚》，进口“变形金刚”玩具的部门应从中吸取教训，从严检查进口玩具。
