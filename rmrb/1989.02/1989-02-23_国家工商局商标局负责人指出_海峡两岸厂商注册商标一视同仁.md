	The official from the State Administration for Industry and Commerce Trademark Office emphasized that Taiwan enterprises applying for trademark registration on the mainland will be treated equally with mainland enterprises and will be exempt from notarization. Li Jizhong, the Director of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, stated in an interview today that Taiwan and the mainland are inseparable parts of the territory of the motherland. Therefore, it is only natural for Taiwan enterprises to register trademarks on the mainland. This will be beneficial for promoting economic and trade exchanges across the Taiwan Strait and for protecting the trademark rights of Taiwan enterprises. He said, "We have always adopted a welcoming and accommodating attitude towards this."

	Li Jizhong revealed that to facilitate Taiwan enterprises in registering trademarks on the mainland, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce Trademark Office has decided that for Taiwan enterprises applying for trademark registration on the mainland, the trademark administration will treat them equally with mainland enterprises and exempt them from notarization. Their trademark applications will be reviewed according to the relevant provisions of the Trademark Law. For trademarks that are approved for registration, their exclusive rights will be protected. Considering the actual situation across the Taiwan Strait, the Trademark Office will designate trademark agencies in Hong Kong to handle the trademark registration affairs for Taiwan enterprises on the mainland.

	It is understood that from March 1988 to yesterday, the Trademark Office has accepted 765 trademark registrations from Taiwan, with 11 already approved for registration.

　　国家工商局商标局负责人指出
    海峡两岸厂商注册商标一视同仁
    本报北京２月２２日讯  记者潘岗报道：台湾厂商到大陆申请商标注册，中国商标主管机关将与大陆企业一视同仁，免予公证。国家工商局局长李继忠今天发表谈话时认为，台湾和大陆都是祖国领土不可分割的组成部分，台湾厂商到大陆注册商标是顺理成章的事情。这对于促进海峡两岸的经济贸易往来，保护台湾厂商的商标权益都是有益的。他说，“对此，我们一贯采取热情欢迎、提供方便的态度”。
    李继忠透露，为方便台湾企业到大陆注册商标，国家工商局商标局决定，对台湾厂商企业到大陆申请商标注册，商标主管机关将与大陆企业一视同仁，免予公证；其商标申请依商标法的有关规定进行审查，对核准注册的商标，保护其专用权；考虑到海峡两岸的实际情况，商标局将指定在香港的中国商标代理机构，代理台湾厂商到大陆注册商标有关事宜。
    据悉，从１９８８年３月到昨日，商标局已受理台湾注册商标７６５件，有１１件已核准注册。
