The World Cup football qualifier between China and Bangladesh will take place tomorrow evening. The Bangladesh national team has announced that they will adopt a defensive strategy.

Guangzhou, February 21st - The temperature in Guangzhou this February is around 20°C, making it very suitable for a football match. The Bangladesh football team, which arrived a day earlier than planned, is in good spirits. Coach Kundu said, "It's much cooler and more comfortable here than in Bangkok. I believe my players will perform well in the match."

Indeed, the Bangladesh team does not seem to have been affected by their loss in their first match against Thailand. This afternoon, the Bangladesh team trained for two hours at Tianhe Stadium, an hour longer than originally scheduled. From the training session, it was evident that the players were in high spirits. Coach Kundu pointed to his players and said, "Their current condition is even better than when we were in Thailand."

Coach Kundu acknowledged that the Chinese football team is a strong team in Asia, with more experience and strength than the Bangladesh team. He also mentioned that the Bangladesh team has been together for a short time, and their overall coordination might be lacking, but the individual skills of the players can make up for this deficiency. Kundu said that when facing the Chinese team, we will consider using a defensive formation because the Chinese team is playing at home and has a strong attacking threat.

In fact, the Bangladesh team also practiced their offensive strategies today. The team's two wingers are fast and have good ball control, often able to accurately pass the ball to the other side or behind the defenders on the flanks or in the middle. It seems that this team also has some tricks up their sleeve for quick counterattacks. The team's physical characteristics are also noteworthy, with an average height of 1.71 meters, but the central defenders, central midfielders, and center forwards are all tall, which is somewhat similar to the Chinese team.

　　世界杯足球赛外围赛中孟两队明晚开战
    孟加拉国队称将取守势
    本报广州２月２１日电  二月羊城，气温在２０℃上下，很适宜于足球赛。比原计划提前一天抵达的孟加拉国足球队感觉良好，教练昆杜先生说：“这里比曼谷凉快，舒服多了，相信我的队员能打好比赛。”
    的确，孟加拉国队似乎并未因首战负于泰国队而影响士气。今天下午，孟加拉国队到天河体育场训练了两小时，比原定时间加时１个钟头。从训练情况看，队员们精神振作。昆杜先生指着队员说：“他们现在的状态比在泰国时还要好。”
    昆杜先生承认，中国足球队是亚洲的一支强队，有经验、实力强于孟加拉国队。他又介绍说，孟加拉国队组队时间短，整体配合可能差些，但队员个人技术可以弥补这个欠缺。昆杜说，对付中国队，我们将考虑以侧重防守的阵容出战，因为中国队是主场，而且进攻很有威胁。
    其实，孟加拉国队今天也专门练了进攻。这个队的两员边锋速度快，脚头也较准，在快速带球突破中常常能准确地将球转移向另一边路，或传入中路两侧的后卫身后。看来该队的快速反击也会有些招数，这个队的身材也很有特点，全队平均身高１．７１米，但中卫、中前卫和中锋却是高个子，这一点倒是与中国队相似。
