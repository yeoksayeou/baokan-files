Significant advances have been made in the treatment of primary liver cancer at the Second Automobile Works Central Hospital. The hospital's use of comprehensive cryotherapy has given patients with mid-to-late-stage liver cancer new hope for survival.

It is understood that the current treatment for early-stage liver cancer in China involves "surface contact" technology. Due to limitations in the depth and range of freezing, this method cannot cause complete necrosis of mid-to-late-stage liver cancer or larger cancerous masses. Since July 1987, a research team led by Dai Zongqing, the chief physician and director of surgery at the Second Automobile Works Central Hospital, and deputy chief physician Chen Jinruo, has been studying comprehensive cryotherapy. This method involves inserting multiple rod-shaped cooling needles into the liver cancerous mass to perform "comprehensive" freezing, causing the cancerous mass to undergo coagulation necrosis. The treatment of eight liver cancer patients has shown good short-term results.

　　冷冻疗法治疗肝癌获重要进展
    据新华社武汉１月３１日电  （记者陶国栋）原发性肝癌的治疗在第二汽车制造厂中心医院获得重要进展。他们采用的全方位冷冻疗法，使中晚期肝癌患者又有了生存的希望。
    据了解，目前我国对早期肝癌的冷冻治疗是采用“表面接触”技术，由于受到冷冻深度和范围的限制，还不能使中晚期肝癌或较大的癌块全部坏死。从１９８７年７月开始，由二汽中心医院主任医师、外科主任戴宗晴、副主任医师陈金若等组成的研究小组开始研究了全方位冷冻疗法。这种方法将多支棒状致冷针头插入肝脏癌块部位进行“全方位”冷冻，使癌块凝固性坏死。治疗的８名肝癌患者，近期效果良好。
