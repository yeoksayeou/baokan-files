The Second Chinese Weiqi Masters Tournament opens in Beijing

The People's Daily, Beijing, February 17th - Correspondent Chen Zhao reports: The second Chinese Weiqi Masters Tournament began this morning at the Sino-Japanese Weiqi Association in Beijing. This event, co-hosted by the People's Daily Overseas Edition and the Chinese Weiqi Association, is considered the highest-level Weiqi competition in the country. Currently, almost all of China's mainland 6th dan and above players, except for a few, are participating in this tournament.

The second Chinese Weiqi Masters Tournament will be conducted in three stages. The first stage will feature 48 players divided into three groups, each competing in a single-elimination format. The winner from each group will advance to the next stage. The second stage will include the three winners from the first stage, along with last year's finalists Yu Bin, Ma Xiaochun, Cheng Xiaoliu, Yang Jinhua, and the Weiqi Saint Nie Weiping. These eight players will compete in a round-robin tournament from July to August to determine the challenger for last year's champion Liu Xiaoguang. The new champion will be decided in October through a best-of-five match. By the end of this year, the champions of China and Japan will face off in Beijing.

The organizers have arranged for 10 young players from the national training team to participate in this tournament to foster their development. Among them, players like Chang Hao and Liu Jing are seen as the future stars of Chinese Weiqi.

Today, senior advisors of the Chinese Weiqi Association, such as Jin Ming and Tang Ke, also enthusiastically attended the opening ceremony and watched the matches. The chief referee for this tournament is Chen Zude, the chairman of the Chinese Weiqi Association.

    第二届中国围棋名人战将分成三个阶段进行。第一阶段有４８名棋手参加，他们分成三组进行单败淘汰赛，最后每组决出一人进入下一阶段。参加第二阶段比赛的除以上３名棋手外，还有上届进入循环圈的俞斌、马晓春、程晓流、杨晋华以及棋圣聂卫平五人。他们８人将在今年７—８月间进行单循环赛，以决出向上届名人刘小光的挑战者。新名人将在１０月以后通过五局三胜制的比赛产生。今年年底，中日两国的名人将在北京决战。
    主办单位为了培养年轻棋手，因此，参加这次比赛的除了有久负盛名的棋坛骁将外，还有正在国家集训队训练的１０名少年棋手。他们之中的常昊、刘菁等人被称为中国棋坛未来的“希望之星”。
