Vice Minister of the Ministry of Personnel, Cheng Lianchang, has proposed six opinions on deepening the reform of personnel systems in enterprises and institutions.

First, further introduce the competitive mechanism and promote the open recruitment system for enterprise managers. Local authorities should popularize and promote this system based on successful pilot projects.

Second, continuously reform enterprise personnel management work to deepen the enterprise personnel system. Currently, the following steps should be taken: one, seriously implement the principle of the factory director (manager) having the right to hire and fire; two, optimize the internal structure of the enterprise at various levels, especially to select and appoint the best candidates for management positions and technical personnel, and optimize the entire enterprise system; three, establish a relatively complete, scientific, and reasonable personnel management system that adapts to the production and management of the enterprise.

Third, seriously promote the supporting reforms of the enterprise personnel system. Internally, the following steps should be taken: one, establish a system for defining positions and job numbers; two, establish a wage system that adapts to the internal personnel management of the enterprise; three, adhere to the principle of unifying responsibility, authority, and benefits; four, reasonably and appropriately place demoted officials and surplus personnel. Externally, the following steps should be taken: one, lay the foundation for establishing a social adjustment mechanism for talent flow; two, gradually use the market to regulate talent flow.

Fourth, strengthen investigations and research, summarize experiences, and timely solve new situations and problems that arise during the reform.

Fifth, the reform of the personnel system in institutions should also reflect the principles of openness, equality, democracy, competition, and selection of the best. Different situations should be addressed through classified reform and management.

Sixth, changing traditional concepts and fostering a competitive consciousness must be regarded as an important issue in deepening the reform of personnel systems in enterprises and institutions.
