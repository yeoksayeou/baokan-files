Title: Bamboo's Visit to the US and Trends in US-Japan Relations

On January 31, Japanese Prime Minister Takeshita Noboru flew to New York. As the first foreign head of state to visit the United States after the inauguration of the Bush administration, he began a seven-day visit. As in the previous year, the United States was the first country Takeshita visited in the new year. The difference is that Takeshita's image of being inept in diplomacy has changed. The tone of Takeshita's visit to the U.S. this time is: through calm and rational dialogue and steady efforts, to establish a personal trust relationship with Bush.

Japan has noted that after Bush took office in the White House, he expressed that his government would comprehensively review U.S. foreign policy to take new steps. What are the cards in Bush's new diplomatic steps regarding Japan policy? Takeshita is still unsure. But at least three factors make Japan uneasy. First, the new Secretary of State Baker and the new Secretary of Agriculture Yeutter have both dealt with Japan in economic frictions and are known to the Japanese as tenacious negotiating opponents. Second, in recent days, the newly appointed Secretary of Defense Cheney and Trade Representative Fields have both applied pressure to Japan in their inaugural speeches, causing unease in Japanese political circles. Third, the Democrats, who advocate a tough line against Japan, hold the majority of seats in the U.S. Congress. Therefore, through this visit to the United States, exploring the direction of the Bush administration's policy towards Japan is one of Takeshita's goals.

The fiscal and trade deficits facing the Bush administration are also a concern for Japan. Japan's exports to the U.S. account for 40% of its total exports. If the portion re-exported through other countries is added, nearly 50% of Japan's exports depend on the U.S. market. In 1988, Japan purchased 1/4 of the U.S. government's long-term bonds. Therefore, Japan is the most affected by a U.S. economic recession. Whether from the perspective of an alliance or self-interest, Japan will not remain indifferent to the rise and fall of the U.S. economy. Takeshita will express to Bush that Japan will fully cooperate in reducing the twin deficits.

In recent years, the most newsworthy aspect of U.S.-Japan relations has been the economic frictions between the two countries. In the past, friction between the two countries has mostly been in the post-World War II era, with Japan making slight concessions to temporarily ease the situation. Despite repeated "knocking" by the U.S. and repeated "concessions" by Japan, Japan's trade surplus with the U.S. has risen from $20 billion in the 1960s to over $50 billion in 1988. Currently, not only is the amount high and difficult to reduce, but the scope and level of friction have also widened. In the past, U.S.-Japan friction often originated from specific commodities, but now, circulation systems, investment areas, intellectual property rights, and "sharing defense responsibilities" have all become new friction points. The U.S.-Japan summit talks will not, of course, argue endlessly about specific friction issues, but they will discuss the principles of resolving friction. For this purpose, Takeshita brings a new "prescription": proposing to establish a "comprehensive consultation mechanism" led by high-level officials from both the U.S. and Japan, to coordinate the two countries' relations from a macro perspective, to reduce the embarrassment caused to both sides by the past "patchwork" approach of local treatment, and to prevent friction before it occurs. At present, it is not yet known how the U.S. side will react to this and the effectiveness of this treatment.

Takeshita will also propose to Bush that the U.S. and Japan cooperate on how to solve the debt problems of third-world countries and global environmental protection. The debt issue affects the world economy. As the world's largest creditor, Takeshita said Japan should do something about this issue. Global environmental protection is a hot topic this year. At the beginning of the new year, Takeshita emphasized the need to strengthen "environmental diplomacy" to enrich his often-proposed slogan of "Japan contributing to the world."

"The new breeze is blowing..." The opening words of Bush's inauguration speech have recently become a catchphrase for Japanese political and academic circles when discussing U.S.-Japan relations. People here believe that with the relative decline of U.S. economic power and the continuous strengthening of Japan's economic power, U.S.-Japan relations will also undergo some new changes. But the basic rhythm is largely the same as in the past: there are both "gentle breezes" and "sudden gusts."

　　竹下访美和日美关系动向
    本报记者  于青
    １月３１日，日本首相竹下登飞往纽约，作为布什新政权成立后第一位访问美国的外国首脑，开始为时七天的访问。与去年一样，美国是竹下在新的一年中出访的第一个国家。不同的是，竹下不擅外交的形象已经改变。竹下此次访美的基调是：通过平心静气的对话、稳健扎实的努力，与布什建立个人信赖关系。
    日本注意到，布什入主白宫后，曾表示他的政府将全面回顾美国的外交政策，以便采取新的步骤。布什外交新步骤中对日政策的底牌是什么，竹下还不摸底。但至少有三个因素使日本感到不安。第一，新任国务卿贝克和新任农业部长尤特都曾在经济摩擦中和日本打过交道，是日本人熟知的、顽强的谈判对手。第二，近日，美国新任国防部长托尔、贸易代表菲尔兹在就职后的发言中，都向日本施加压力，引起日本朝野不安。第三，主张对日实行强硬方针的民主党在美国国会中占据了多数议席。因此，通过此次美国之行，打探布什新政权对日政策的走向，是竹下此行的目的之一。
    布什政府面临的财政、贸易双赤字，也是日本的一块心病。日本对美出口占全部出口的４０％，如果再加上经过其他国家加工转口部分，日本就有近５０％的出口依赖美国市场。１９８８年美国政府的长期国债，日本购买了１／４。因此受美国经济衰退影响最大的是日本。无论从盟友关系，还是从自身利益考虑，日本对美国经济的消长，都不会无动于衷。竹下此行将向布什表示，对于削减双赤字，日本方面将全面合作。
    近年来的日美关系中，最出新闻的是双方的经济摩擦。过去两国间的摩擦，大多是在进入白化热后，以日本略作让步得以暂时缓解。尽管美国不断“敲打”，日本一再“让步”，但日本对美国贸易黑字仍从６０年代的２０亿美元升至１９８８年的５００多亿美元。目前，不但在数量上居高难下，而且摩擦的幅度更宽，层次更高了。以往日美摩擦多发端于具体商品，而现在，流通制度、投资领域、知识产权、“分担防卫责任”等都成了新的摩擦热点。日美首脑会谈，当然不会就摩擦的具体问题争论不休，然而将会谈及解决摩擦的原则。竹下为此带去一副新“处方”：提议建立以美日双方高级别官员为首的“综合协商机构”，从宏观角度协调两国关系，以整体治理的方式，减少过去“医头医脚”的局部治理方式给双方造成的困窘，防摩擦于未然。目下，尚不知美国方面对此反应和此方疗效如何。
    竹下此行还准备向布什提出，在如何解决第三世界国家债务问题和全球环境保护问题上日美进行合作。债务问题牵动世界经济神经，作为世界上最大债权国的日本，竹下表示在此问题上日本应该有所作为。全球环境保护问题是今年的热门话题。新年伊始，竹下强调要加强“环境外交”，以充实他多次提出的“为世界做出贡献的日本”这一口号。
    “新的微风正在吹拂……”，布什就职演说中的开场白，近来也成了日本政界、学界人士谈论日美关系时的口头禅。此间人士认为，随着美国经济实力的相对衰弱，日本经济实力的不断增强，日美关系也将产生一些新的变化。但基本节奏与过去大同小异：既有“微风和煦”，也有“狂风乍起”。
