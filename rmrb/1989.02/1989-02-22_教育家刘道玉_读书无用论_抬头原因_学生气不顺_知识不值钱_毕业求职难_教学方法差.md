The editor's note: The "reading is useless" theory was a noisy echo from a bygone era. Who would have thought that in the midst of China's modernization, a "new reading is useless" theory would emerge? The dropout rates among middle and high school students, and the disillusionment among college students, have already caused serious concern across society. People are pondering and questioning: How did this happen? How can it be overcome? Our newspaper is opening a column for discussion and welcomes insights from all sectors.

Educator Liu Daoyu—The Reasons Behind the Rise of the "Reading is Useless" Theory
Students Are Frustrated, Knowledge is Undervalued, Job Hunting is Difficult, Teaching Methods are Poor

Reporter Zhou Qing: In some universities in the capital, two new factions have emerged among the students. One is the "Tao Pai," who are eager to take the TOEFL exam and go abroad; the other is the "Ma Pai," who play mahjong until late at night and spread out blankets in the hallways to play. It is understood that many universities have seen waves of students going abroad, dropping out, playing cards, doing business, and falling in love. Some have even resorted to gambling. This indicates that the "reading is useless" theory is indeed on the rise. You have been a school principal and a chemistry professor, and you are currently writing a monograph on education. In your opinion, what are the reasons behind the rise of the "reading is useless" theory?

Liu Daoyu: The main reasons lie not with the students, but with society and the schools. First, the youth's enthusiasm for the nation has not been well understood or guided. Society's criticism outweighs its concern, leaving students frustrated and seeking outlets, often appearing indifferent and cynical.

Second, knowledge is undervalued in today's society. Whether one goes to school or not makes little difference, and sometimes those who haven't gone to school earn more than those who have. Naturally, the appeal of reading diminishes. This is a tragedy for a civilized nation. Throughout history, scholars have always advocated for reading, with many inspiring stories and motivational quotes. However, there are also temptations, such as "Books contain golden houses, beautiful women, and a thousand bushels of grain." Reducing the value of reading to the pursuit of wealth and beauty has negative effects. University students in the 1980s would not view reading this way, but they say that now "books contain only bitterness and astringency." This should alert the entire society.

Reporter: Indeed, values ultimately need to be practical. Currently, society has two distribution methods: one is the state distributing salaries based on its financial capacity, and the other is some joint ventures, private, and individual enterprises paying based on market prices, with the latter being much higher. Most of the work that intellectuals do falls under state-controlled institutions, so intellectuals mostly belong to the low-paying group. This problem needs to be resolved as soon as possible.

Liu Daoyu: The third reason for the rise of the "reading is useless" theory is the difficulty university graduates face in finding jobs. We have been promoting the idea that talent is the key to the success or failure of modernization. Many places have been calling out for a lack of talent, but at the same time, some students trained by schools have difficulty being assigned jobs, and even when assigned, they struggle to use their strengths, lacking certain work and living conditions. There is a common phenomenon: many important positions are occupied by young people who did not go to college. Due to their low quality, the units often have to spend money on training, while those relatively more outstanding young people who graduate from college find it hard to find suitable positions. This leads to a huge waste and also causes in-school students to lose their learning enthusiasm and out-of-school students to lose interest in studying.

Reporter: Over the past decade of reform, our society has always suffered from a combination of talent hunger and poor talent utilization. The use of talent mainly does not depend on qualifications, knowledge, or ability, but on household registration, relationships, and seniority, neglecting the essentials. It seems that we have not yet found a fundamental solution to the problem.

Liu Daoyu: In addition to social factors, the outdated and backward teaching content and methods in universities are also important reasons for students' disillusionment. The courses taught by teachers do not absorb much of the latest scientific knowledge, failing to answer students' questions and enhance their competitiveness in society; the teaching methods of teachers are self-lecturing while students listen quietly. This was the teaching method before the invention of paper, when students had no textbooks. To this day, this old method is still used to teach university students. If I were to go back to university, I would also be disillusioned.

Reporter: Today, you have mentioned four reasons for the rise of the "reading is useless" theory: students are frustrated, knowledge is undervalued, job hunting is difficult, and teaching methods are poor, all of which make sense. Now, we are promoting a socialist market economy, and the value law and commodity exchange principles will inevitably permeate education and the relationship between society, schools, and students. This is an unavoidable fact. Coupled with the challenges of the new technological revolution, how education's concepts, systems, and status should change is a big issue worth studying. Currently, the rise of the "reading is useless" theory seems to be a manifestation of various confusions. To completely reverse it, we still need to continue exploring within the context of reform.

Liu Daoyu: Yes.

### 教育家刘道玉——“读书无用论”抬头原因  学生气不顺　知识不值钱　毕业求职难　教学方法差

专栏：

    编者的话：“读书无用论”，是那个已经逝去了的梦魇般时代的喧闹。没想到，在中华民族走向现代化的时候还会冒出一个“新的读书无用论”。中小学生的辍学、大学生的厌学，已经引起社会各界的严重关切。人们在思索、在诘问：它是怎样形成的？如何克服它？本报开辟专栏讨论，欢迎各界有识之士回答。
　　教育家刘道玉——
    “读书无用论”抬头原因
    学生气不顺　知识不值钱　毕业求职难　教学方法差
    本报记者周庆：首都某高校的学生中出现了新的两派，一派叫“托派”、一心想考“托福”出国；另一派叫“麻派”，麻将牌搓到深夜，在走廊铺上毯子干。据了解，不少高校都交替出现了出国潮、退学潮、打牌热、经商热、恋爱热，有的甚至出现赌博，这说明“读书无用论”确有抬头。您当过校长，又是化学教授，最近又在写教育学方面的专著，您看“读书无用论”抬头的原因是什么？
    刘道玉：主要原因不在学生，而在社会和学校。其一是青年学生关心国是的满腔热情没有被很好理解，缺乏正确的引导，社会上的指责多于关心，学生气不顺，别求宣泄，表现出一副玩世不恭的样子。
    其二是现在社会上知识不值钱，上学与不上学一个样，甚至不上学比上过学的还多赚钱，读书的吸引力自然就下降了。这是一个文明古国的悲哀。自古以来，凡有识之士莫不倡导读书，这方面有许多极为感人的故事和催人上进的名言。当然，也有一些引诱人的话，如“书中自有黄金屋，书中自有颜如玉，书中自有千钟粟”。把读书的意义单纯归结为追求金钱美女，是有消极影响的。８０年代的大学生，当不会对读书作如是观，但是，他们说现在“书中只有苦和涩”，这就应该引起全社会的注意。
    记者：是的，价值观最后是要落在实处的。现在社会上存在两种分配方式，一是国家按照财力的可能，发给工作人员工资，二是有些合资、私营、个人企业，按照市场价格付酬，后者大大高于前者。现在知识分子从事的工作，大多属于国家控制的机构，所以知识分子大多属于领取低报酬的阶层。这个问题应尽快解决。
    刘道玉：“读书无用论”抬头的第三个原因，是大学生出路困难。我们到处宣传人才是四化建设成败的关键，不少地方一直喊叫缺少人才，但与此同时，学校培养出来的一些学生难于分配，分配了也难以用其所长，缺乏一定的工作和生活条件。有一种现象很普遍：不少重要的工作岗位由考不上大学的青年占据着，由于素质低，单位往往要花钱培训，而那些相对比较优秀的青年上大学毕业归来，却找不到合适的岗位，这不能不造成巨大的浪费。这也造成了在校生学习积极性不高，不在校的对上学失去了兴趣。
    记者：改革１０年来，我们的社会一直存在着人才饥渴和人才消化不良综合症，人才的使用，主要不是看资格、学识、能力，而是看户口、关系、工龄，舍本逐末，目前似乎还没有找到从根本上解决问题的途径。
    刘道玉：除了社会原由，大学的教学内容和方法陈旧、落后，也是引起学生厌学的重要原因。老师讲授的课程，吸收最新的各种科学知识不多，既不能回答学生心中的疑问，又不能提高他们在社会上的竞争力；老师讲课方法，是自己口授，学生静听，这本是造纸术出现之前、学生没有课本时的教学方法。到今天还沿用这种老办法教大学生，让我重新上大学，我也厌学。
    记者：“读书无用论”抬头的原因您今天谈到４条：学生气不顺，知识不值钱，毕业求职难，教学方法差，都有道理。现在我们搞社会主义商品经济，价值规律、商品交换的原则必然浸入到教育和社会、学校和学生的关系中，这是无法回避的事实。再加上新技术革命的挑战，教育的观念、体制、地位究竟如何改变，还是个值得研究的大问题。眼下“读书无用论”抬头，看来已是种种困惑的表现之一，要完全扭转它，还需要在改革这个大背景下继续探讨。
    刘道玉：是的。
