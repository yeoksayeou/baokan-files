On the anniversary of the passing of Comrade Liu Yaxiong, compiling a memorial collection for her is, in my opinion, a meaningful endeavor. Remembering the departed, inspiring the living.

Comrade Yaxiong joined the revolution in 1924 and the Party in 1926. Over the course of more than 60 years, she dedicated herself to the Party's cause, working tirelessly and achieving remarkable feats in her ordinary work.

Yaxiong was one of the pioneers of Shanxi women joining the revolution after the May Fourth Movement. I got to know her father, Liu Shaobai, earlier and came to know her and work with her in February 1931, after the Party's Sixth Plenum of the Fourth Central Committee. She and Comrade Chen Yuandao came to Tianjin. Yuandao served as the Secretary of the Organization Department of the Hebei Provincial Committee, effectively managing the entire provincial committee's work, while Yaxiong served as the Secretary-General of the provincial committee. Soon after, due to organizational damage, she and Yuandao, along with many other comrades, were arrested, sentenced, and imprisoned in the "Beiping Military Re-education Camp" (also known as Caolianzi Prison). Shortly thereafter, the new Hebei Provincial Committee (in Beiping) was also compromised, and I was also arrested and imprisoned there. After the "January 28 Incident," in the autumn of 1932, it was said that the "Kuomintang was preparing to move the capital," and a so-called amnesty was granted to "political prisoners." Yuandao and Yaxiong were both released. Subsequently, Yaxiong and her husband, Yuandao, went to work for the Jiangsu Provincial Committee. Soon after, Yuandao was arrested again by the reactionary authorities and martyred in Nanjing's Rainflower Terrace in 1933. Facing this blow, Yaxiong remained steadfast. She continued her work for the Party with unyielding revolutionary spirit, overcoming numerous difficulties, and raising her posthumous child under extremely harsh conditions. In the autumn of 1936, after returning to Beiping from Taiyuan, I met with her again. Also present was Comrade Kong Xiangzhen, and the meeting took place in Zhongshan Park. I invited them to work in Taiyuan. With the approval of the North China Bureau, Yaxiong came to Taiyuan and served as the instructor of the eleventh company (women's company) of the Shanxi Military and Political Training Class. Through her diligent work and guidance, the female students of the training class quickly grew, and later, after enduring the trials of war, most of them became outstanding female cadres of our Party and Army. The majority of these comrades joined the Communist Party, and it can be said that she had disciples everywhere. At the end of 1937, she was tasked with establishing a guerrilla force of over 200 people under the leadership of the Suicide Squad. She served as the instructor, and the commander was an old Red Army cadre named Yang Shijie. This was the first guerrilla force in Shanxi and became the foundation for the later First Guerrilla Regiment. During the period when the Suicide First Column moved to the southeast of Shanxi to establish a base area, she served as the magistrate of a special district. At that time, I came to know her more deeply. When she went to Yan'an for study, especially after the nationwide liberation and served as the Deputy Minister of Labor, our interactions became more frequent. Her diligent and practical learning and working spirit left a good impression on me.

During Yaxiong's work in the white areas, it was a time when "leftist" errors were rampant within the Party, and she was also influenced in her thoughts and work. However, after she came to Shanxi, she correctly executed the central policies in all aspects, especially in opposing sectarianism and implementing the separation of open work from secret work, and legal work from illegal work, she showed particular firmness. I believe this is inseparable from her deep understanding of the harmful effects of "leftist" errors. This also shows that being influenced by erroneous ideas is not frightening; as long as one learns from them, they can become a driving force for progress, making oneself a more awake and conscious revolutionary on the path of seeking truth.

Yaxiong was serious and responsible in her work, but she was also an approachable and kind-hearted elder sister when dealing with comrades. Her integrity and virtue, winning the respect and affection of everyone. She was also a good mother, and her stories of loving and raising her children have been praised by friends and people who know her. Her family was a revolutionary family, with her father, sisters, and brothers all taking the revolutionary path and contributing to the Party and the people's cause in their own ways. All of this is undoubtedly inseparable from Yaxiong's influence.

In the journey of revolution and life, Yaxiong experienced many hardships, which can be described as full of obstacles and full of hardships. For example, after the martyrdom of Comrade Chen Yuandao, for a considerable period, the organization did not assign her any work, leaving her to act on her own in the white areas, with no access to documents or instructions, and her situation was extremely difficult; again, during the "rectification campaign" in Yan'an, she was falsely accused of being a "traitor," and it was only two years later that she was exonerated; as for the persecution she suffered during the "Cultural Revolution," it is even more unnecessary to mention. However, in the face of these hardships and injustices, she did not sink into despair. She remained steadfast in her loyalty to the Party and the revolution, unyielding, and even more determined after each setback. This is indeed rare. In short, whether in times of success or adversity, Yaxiong dedicated her entire being to the Party's work, devoting her life to the cause of liberating the Chinese people and building socialism. She is indeed a loyal communist warrior and a revolutionary of the proletariat. Her selfless and fearless revolutionary spirit, her high sense of responsibility for the Party's work, her close ties with the masses, her insistence on seeking truth from facts, and her hardworking style are all worthy of our learning and that of future generations.

Of course, like all revolutionaries, Yaxiong was not a perfect person. She also had her weaknesses and shortcomings. Sometimes, when she had opinions on certain matters and felt that she was being treated unfairly, she did not speak up but chose to endure it herself. Some comrades felt that she was somewhat "fastidious," probably stemming from this. This weakness, for her, was undoubtedly a "minor flaw," but she took it very seriously, not only not hiding it but also constantly striving to correct it. She always believed that a Communist's process of dedicating oneself to the Party and the people is also a process of constantly recognizing and transforming oneself in practice. Her spirit of strict self-discipline is, I believe, also worthy of remembrance and learning.

　　《刘亚雄纪念集》序
    薄一波
    在刘亚雄同志逝世周年之际，编写一本纪念她的集子，我认为这是一件有意义的工作。缅怀逝者，策励来兹。
    亚雄同志１９２４年参加革命，１９２６年入党。６０余年来，她为党的事业忘我工作，奋斗不已，在平凡的工作中，做出了不平凡的业绩。
    亚雄同志是五四运动后三晋妇女参加革命的先驱之一。我与她父亲刘少白相识较早，同她认识并在一起工作，是在１９３１年２月党的六届四中全会后。她同陈原道同志来到天津，原道同志任顺直省委组织部长，实际上主管省委的全面工作，亚雄同志任省委秘书长。不久，因组织遭受破坏，她和原道及大批同志被捕，判刑后被关押在“北平军人反省分院”（即草岚子监狱）。稍后，新的顺直省委（在北平）又遭破坏，我也被捕，关押在这里。“一二八”事件发生后，１９３２年秋，说“国民党准备迁都”，对“政治犯”实行所谓大赦，原道、亚雄同志都获释。随后，亚雄同志和她的爱人原道同志，一同去江苏省委工作。不久，原道同志又被反动当局逮捕，１９３３年牺牲在南京雨花台。面对这一打击，亚雄同志坚强不屈。她一如既往，以百折不挠的革命毅力，战胜重重困难，顽强地为党工作，在十分艰难的情况下，把遗腹子抚养大。１９３６年秋，我从太原返北平后，再次同她会面。同时见面的还有孔祥桢同志，地点是在中山公园。我请他们到太原工作。经北方局同意，亚雄同志来到了太原，担任山西军政训练班十一连（女生连）指导员。经过她的辛勤工作和教导，训练班的女青年迅速成长，后来她们历经战争的磨砺，大都成为我党、我军的优秀妇女干部，其中绝大多数同志加入了共产党，可以说她是桃李满天下。１９３７年底，她受命创建了一支２００多人的抗日游击队，属决死队领导。她当指导员，队长是一位红军老干部叫杨世杰。这是山西第一支游击队，成为尔后游一团的基础。在决死一纵队转赴晋东南创建根据地期间，她担任过第三行政区一个专署的专员，这时我对她有了更深的了解。及至她去延安学习特别是全国解放后出任劳动部副部长，我们的接触就更多了。她那种孜孜以求、扎扎实实的学习和工作精神，给我留下了良好的印象。
    亚雄同志在白区工作那一段，正是党内“左”倾错误盛行的时期，她在思想上工作上也受到过一些影响。但是，她到山西以后，在各个方面都能正确地执行中央的方针政策，特别是在反对关门主义，实行公开工作与秘密工作分开、合法工作与非法工作分开方面，表现得尤为坚定。我想，这是同她对“左”倾错误的恶果有了深切的认识分不开的。这也说明，一个人受到错误东西的影响并不可怕，只要从中吸取教训，就会变成前进的动力，促使自己在探求真理的道路上成为更加清醒和自觉的革命者。
    亚雄同志对工作严肃认真，而在与同志们相处时，她却是一位平易近人，和蔼可亲的大姐。她的以诚寓德、以德感人的风范，赢得了大家的尊敬和爱戴。她还是一位良母，其爱子、育子的事迹，在了解她的朋友和人们中一直传为佳话。她的家庭是一个革命之家，父亲、姐妹、兄弟都先后走上了革命道路，为党和人民的事业各自作出了贡献。这一切，无疑是与亚雄同志的影响分不开的。
    在革命和人生的征途中，亚雄同志经历了不少磨难，可以说是坎坷丛生，饱经忧患。例如，在陈原道同志牺牲后，相当长一段时间内组织上未给她分配工作，让她在白区自行活动，文件看不到，指示也没有，处境之艰，可想而知；又如，在延安的“抢救运动”中，硬说她是“叛徒”，两年之后，才予平反；至于“文化大革命”中她遭受的迫害就更不用说了。但是，在这些磨难和冤屈面前，她没有消沉，她对党对革命始终初衷不改，矢志不移，而且愈挫愈奋，这确实是难能可贵的。总之，无论在顺利还是在逆境时，亚雄同志都把自己的全部身心投入到了党的工作中去，为了中国人民的解放事业和社会主义建设事业贡献了毕生的精力。她不愧为一个忠诚的共产主义战士和无产阶级革命家。她的无私无畏的革命精神，她对党的工作的高度责任感，她密切联系群众、坚持实事求是和艰苦奋斗的工作作风，都是值得我们和后人学习的。
    当然，亚雄同志同所有的革命者一样，不可能是完人。她也有自己的弱点和不足。有时她对一些事情有意见，明明感到对自己不公正，她也不愿提出，而自我忍让，一些同志觉得她有些“洁身自爱”，大概就是由此而来的。这种弱点，对她来说，无疑是些“微瑕”，但她却看得很重，不仅毫不掩饰，而且一直在努力改正。她总是认为，一个共产党员为党为人民奉献自己的过程，也是在实践中不断认识和改造自己的过程。她的这种严于责己的精神，我想同样是值得人们追思和学习的。
