The recipient of the 1988 Nobel Prize in Literature, the renowned Egyptian novelist Najib Mahfouz, is currently in a state of confusion.

It is said that the 77-year-old Mahfouz remains as usual. Every morning, he goes to the Ali Baba Coffee Shop near Liberation Square in the center of Cairo, sips tea, reads the newspaper, and occasionally observes the bustling crowd and the endless stream of vehicles on the street, hoping to find inspiration and characters for his new works.

However, he seems a bit disappointed.

"Writing a novel that reflects our current situation seems difficult," he said. "The Egypt I described was young, and I was very interested in it. Now, corruption has become a part of our daily lives." He sighed, "When you pick up the newspaper, you won't want to read novels anymore."

Mahfouz, the great writer who has witnessed the changes of the capital Cairo and the entire country for over half a century, compares today's Egypt to a group of people facing imminent disaster, struggling desperately in the water. He said that when Mubarak took office as president in 1981, this group was submerged 30 meters underwater, "He pushed them up 20 meters, but now they still have 10 meters to go before they surface."

Currently, Egypt is facing issues such as rising prices, low salaries for employees, and debt. Among the people Mahfouz encounters and hears about every day, there are many expressions of dissatisfaction. How to write? What to write about? He feels confused and is exploring...

　　马哈福兹的困惑
    周新本
    １９８８年诺贝尔文学奖的获得者、埃及著名的小说家纳吉布·马哈福兹现在很为难。
    据说７７岁的马哈福兹一如往常。他每天上午到开罗市中心的解放广场旁阿里·巴巴咖啡馆，边饮茶，边看报，不时地注视着大街上熙来攘往的人群和络绎不绝的车辆，希望找到成为他新作构思的线索和人物。
    然而，他似乎有点失望了。
    “要写一部反映我国当前形势的小说，看来很难。”他说道：“我描写的埃及，那时还年轻，我很有兴趣。而现在，腐败现象已成为我们每天生活中的一部分。”他感叹道：“在你拿起报纸的时候，就不会再想看小说。”
    马哈福兹这位目睹了首都开罗和整个国家时代变迁达半个多世纪的伟大作家，把今天的埃及比作是一群面临灭顶之灾、拚命在水中挣扎的人。他说，在１９８１年穆巴拉克就任总统时，这群人没于水下３０米，“他把他们向上推了２０米，但是现在他们还有１０米未出水面。”
    目前，埃及面临着物价上涨、职员工资低和负债等问题。在马哈福兹每天接触和耳闻目睹的人群中，多听到有不满之词。怎么写？写什么？他感到困惑，他在探索……
