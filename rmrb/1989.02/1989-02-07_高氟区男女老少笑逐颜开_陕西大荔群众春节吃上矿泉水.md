Men, women, and children in high-fluoride areas smile happily: Residents of Dali, Shaanxi, enjoy mineral water during the Spring Festival

New China News Agency, Xi'an, February 6 (Reporter Yang Runben, Correspondent Yan Wendi) One of the areas in China with the highest levels of harmful substances in water—Dali County, Shaanxi Province—has 176,000 people who, for the first time this Spring Festival, used high-quality natural mineral water to cook rice and brew tea, entertaining guests and adding joy to this traditional "old lunar year."

In recent days, people in more than 130 villages who have access to mineral water have frequently raised their cups, bowls, and ladles, filled with clear and sweet mineral water, savoring it thoroughly. Thousands of households have repeatedly echoed with joyful and grateful laughter.

Dali is located at the confluence of the Yellow, Wei, and Luo Rivers. The 350,000 villagers in the county's 18 townships and 270 administrative villages have suffered from varying degrees of fluorosis due to long-term consumption of water with excessively high fluoride content. In recent years, with the aid of the United Nations Development Programme and the World Bank, the county committee and government have mobilized the masses to successively drill four artesian wells with water quality meeting mineral water standards, with a total daily flow of 54,800 tons. They have also opened six water pipelines totaling 126.6 kilometers in length and built and installed a rural water supply station. Before the Spring Festival, they had already supplied medical and drinking mineral water to more than half of the population.

　　高氟区男女老少笑逐颜开
　  陕西大荔群众春节吃上矿泉水
    新华社西安２月６日电  （记者杨润本、通讯员阎文德）被列为我国水源中对人体有害物质——氟含量最高的地区之一——陕西省大荔县，今年春节有１７．６万人首次用优质天然矿泉水煮饭沏茶，款待亲朋，从而给这个传统的“旧历年”增添了喜悦。
    连日来，当地吃上矿泉水的１３０多个村庄的男女老少，不时捧起杯碗瓢盆，盛着清甜甘洌的矿泉水，尽情地品尝，千家万户频频传出欢快感激的笑声。
    大荔，位于黄、渭、洛３条河流的交汇处。全县１８个乡镇、２７０个行政村的３５万村民，因长期食用含氟量过高的水，而使大部分人身患不同程度的氟骨病。近两年，在联合国国际开发署以及世界银行的援助下，县委、县政府动员群众，相继打成４眼水质均符合矿泉水标准，合计日涌流量达５．４８万吨的自喷井，开通６条总长１２６．６公里的输水管道，建筑安装起一座农村供水总站。春节前夕，已为一半以上人口送到医饮兼用的矿泉水。
