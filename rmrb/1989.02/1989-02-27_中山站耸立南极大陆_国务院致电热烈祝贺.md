China's first expedition to the eastern Antarctic has, after unremitting efforts, successfully erected the impressive Zhongshan Station on the Antarctic continent. Today, a completion ceremony for Zhongshan Station was held here. The postal service of Zhongshan Station was simultaneously established and began operations.

The first phase of construction for Zhongshan Station, which has a traditional Chinese courtyard style, covers an area of 1,654 square meters. The main building is composed of 28 container rooms. The gold-plated copper sign "China's Zhongshan Station" written by Deng Xiaoping is hung on the left upper side of the main entrance. The right wing is a dormitory building made up of 22 containers, and the left wing is a two-story power station. The meteorological building and oil storage tanks are distributed on the nearby slopes. These red buildings are designed to withstand winds of up to 50 meters per second.

Zhongshan Station is equipped with complete power supply, heating, windproofing, and communication facilities. Communication personnel have successfully tested calls with Beijing using the whip antenna on the main building, proving that communication with the motherland is smooth. The meteorological station at Zhongshan Station can receive high-altitude, surface, and satellite weather analysis fax images broadcast by the Soviet Union's Molodyozhnaya Station, weather telegrams from Antarctic meteorological stations, and high-altitude and surface analysis fax images broadcast by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology in Melbourne. The rooms are as warm as spring, and some team members feel it is no less comfortable than a mid-range hotel in China.

Compared to the Changcheng Station, Zhongshan Station's construction area is nearly four times larger. Local officials believe that Zhongshan Station's construction, despite its short duration and numerous difficulties, has achieved remarkable results. Its construction speed and efficiency are rare in the history of Antarctic station building.

Xinhua News Agency, February 26th: The State Council today sent a telegram to the Chinese Eastern Antarctic Expedition, warmly congratulating the completion of Zhongshan Station.

The telegram said: On the occasion of the completion of Zhongshan Station, we extend our warm congratulations and sincere greetings to all members of the expedition and the crew!

The telegram said: You, in the distant eastern Antarctic, have braved hardships and persevered, overcoming severe ice conditions and ice avalanches, and built our country's second Antarctic scientific research station—Zhongshan Station. This demonstrates the heroic spirit and fearlessness of the Chinese people.

The telegram said: The completion of Zhongshan Station marks a new chapter in China's Antarctic scientific research. It is a great encouragement to all ethnic groups in the country who are striving to achieve modernization and revitalize China. We hope you will build on your achievements, continue to strive, and make greater contributions to the peaceful use of the Antarctic by humanity.

　　中山站耸立南极大陆
    国务院致电热烈祝贺
    新华社拉斯曼丘陵２月２６日电  （记者张继民）中国首次东南极考察队经过不懈努力，规模壮观的中山站终于耸立在南极大陆上。今天，中山站的落成典礼在此间举行。中国南极中山站邮政局同时成立，开始营业。
    这座颇有中国传统庭院特色的中山站第一期建筑面积为１６５４平方米。它的主楼由２８个集装箱房拼装而成。邓小平同志题写的“中国南极中山站”镀金铜质站标，悬挂在主楼正门左上方。右厢是由２２个集装箱组装而成的宿舍楼，左厢为二层楼的发电站。气象楼、贮油罐分布在附近的山坡上。这些红色的建筑按设计可抗每秒５０米的狂风。
    中山站有完备的供电、供暖、防风和通讯设施。电讯人员通过主楼上的鞭状天线与北京多次试验通话，证明与祖国的电讯联络是畅通的。中山站气象台已能接收到苏联南极青年站播发的高空、地面和气象卫星云图分析传真图，南极地区气象站的电传天气电报；以及澳大利亚墨尔本气象中心播发的高空及地面分析传真图。各房间温暖如春，有些队员认为不逊于国内中档宾馆。
    同长城站相比，中山站的建筑面积超过它近四倍。此间人士认为，中山站建设时间短、困难多、成效大，其建设速度和效率在南极建站史上是少见的。
    新华社２月２６日电　国务院今天致电中国东南极考察队，热烈祝贺南极中山站落成。
    电报说，值此南极中山站落成之际，谨向参加建站的全体队员和船员表示热烈祝贺和亲切慰问！
    电报说：你们在远离祖国的东南极，不畏艰险，百折不挠，战胜严重冰情和冰崩，建成了我国第二个南极科学考察站——中山站，表现了中华儿女的英雄气概和大无畏精神。
    电报说：中山站的建成，揭开了我国南极科学考察事业新的一页，对为实现四化、振兴中华而努力奋斗的全国各族人民，是一个极大的鼓舞。希望你们发扬成绩，再接再厉，为人类和平利用南极做出更大的贡献。
