Japan and France are collaborating on a project to predict earthquakes by studying deep-sea bivalves. The joint investigation aims to gather data on tectonic plate movements along the Pacific coast by examining the conditions of giant clams living at depths of four kilometers.

According to a report by the *Asahi Shimbun*, the investigation will commence in August of this year in the waters off the coast of Shimizu, Shizuoka Prefecture. The project will involve approximately thirty researchers from Japan and France, specializing in geophysics, biology, and geochemistry. They will utilize France's most advanced deep-sea submersible to conduct their research.

The primary focus of the study will be on giant clams inhabiting the seabed at a depth of four kilometers. By analyzing the quantity and chemical composition of the groundwater that provides nutrients to these clams, the researchers hope to obtain early data on the movements of the tectonic plates along the Pacific coast. It is believed that the epicenter of the anticipated major earthquake in the Tokai region, which is expected to cause significant damage to Japan, is located in the waters off Shizuoka Prefecture.

    日法联合调查海底生物预测地震
    新华社东京二月九日电  日本与法国合作，计划通过对生息在四千米深海底双叶贝的调查，预报静冈东部海城大地震。
    据《朝日新闻》报道，这一联合调查将从今年八月开始，地点在日本静冈县御前崎海域。参加这一活动的有日本与法国的地球物理、生物、地球化学研究人员约三十人，将使用法国最先进的深海潜水艇。调查对象是生息在海底四千米处的双叶贝，通过掌握为双叶贝提供营养的地下水的水量和化学成份的变化，提前获得太平洋海岸地壳板块变动的数据。据称，预计对日本造成大破坏的东海大地震的震源在静冈县海域。
