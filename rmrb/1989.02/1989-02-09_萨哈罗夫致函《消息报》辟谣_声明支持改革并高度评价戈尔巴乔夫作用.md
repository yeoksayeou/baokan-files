    Soviet renowned nuclear physicist Sakharov wrote a letter to *Izvestia*, stating that he had not told a reporter from the French newspaper *Le Figaro* that someone was plotting to overthrow Gorbachev or that the reforms would fail.

    On February 1, an editorial in *Izvestia* criticized Sakharov for making irresponsible remarks to a French newspaper. Tonight's *Izvestia* published in full Sakharov's letter of clarification dated February 5. Sakharov stated in his letter that he actively supports the reforms, believing them to be necessary, and highly praises the role of the reform advocates, especially Gorbachev.

    Sakharov said that his meeting with the reporter from *Le Figaro*, Barru, was their first. He had invited Barru for tea only after repeated requests. Due to the conversation being translated and Barru's distorted reporting, the aforementioned rumors emerged.

    This distorted conversation became one of the bases for Western media's recent speculations about Gorbachev's position and the operation of the Soviet reforms.

### 萨哈罗夫致函《消息报》辟谣　声明支持改革并高度评价戈尔巴乔夫作用

　　萨哈罗夫致函《消息报》辟谣
　　声明支持改革并高度评价戈尔巴乔夫作用
    新华社莫斯科2月6日电　苏联著名核物理学家萨哈罗夫致信《消息报》，声明他没有对法国《费加罗报》记者说过有人要推翻戈尔巴乔夫及预言改革将失败的话。
    2月1日《消息报》编辑部文章曾批评萨哈罗夫对法国报纸发表不负责任的谈话。今晚的《消息报》全文刊登了萨哈罗夫2月5日写给该报的辟谣信。萨哈罗夫在信中说，他积极支持改革，认为改革是必要的，他高度价评改革倡导者，特别是戈尔巴乔夫的作用。
    萨哈罗夫说，他同法国《费加罗报》记者巴鲁是第一次见面，是在对方多次请求后才邀请他一起喝茶的。由于谈话通过翻译加上巴鲁报道时作了歪曲才出现了上述谣言。
    经过歪曲的这次谈话成了西方舆论工具前一时期对戈尔巴乔夫的地位和苏联改革命运作种种猜测的依据之一。
