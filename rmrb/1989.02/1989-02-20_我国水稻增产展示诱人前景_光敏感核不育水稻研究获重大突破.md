The National Natural Science Foundation of China and the Hubei Provincial Government held an appraisal meeting in Wuhan today, announcing that the research on "The Mechanism and Utilization of Photoperiod-Sensitive Nuclear Male Sterility in Rice" is at the forefront of similar studies both domestically and internationally.

This achievement has yielded significant results in both the theoretical exploration and breeding application of hybrid rice, making a new and important contribution to maintaining China's leading position in the theoretical research and production application of hybrid rice.

Experts predict that this breakthrough will bring about advancements in rice breeding technology in China, showcasing a broad prospect for increased rice production. Its distinctive feature is the transition of hybrid rice from a three-line system to a two-line system, simplifying the production process from complexity. In terms of yield increase, the current 1.84 billion mu (approximately 122.4 million hectares) of hybrid rice in China can potentially increase yield by 5% per mu (approximately 0.067 hectares) based on the current level of 422 kilograms per mu. By utilizing the two-line hybrid advantages between Japonica and Indica rice, from 1992 to 2000, the yield of two-line hybrid rice per mu is expected to be about 20% higher than the current three-line rice, meaning that the 4.8 billion mu (approximately 320 million hectares) of rice nationwide will have a yield increase of about 40% per mu compared to the current ordinary rice.

　　我国水稻增产展示诱人前景    
    光敏感核不育水稻研究获重大突破
    新华社武汉２月１８日电  （记者方政军）今天，国家自然科学基金委员会和湖北省人民政府在武汉通过鉴定，宣布“湖北光周期敏感核不育水稻育性转变机理及其利用”研究在国内外同类研究中处于领先地位。
    这项成果不论在杂交稻的理论探讨还是育种应用上都取得了丰硕的成果，为我国杂交稻的理论研究与生产应用继续保持国际领先地位作出了新的重要贡献。
    专家们预测，这项成果将带来我国水稻育种技术上的进步，对我国水稻增产展示了广阔的前景。它的特点是使杂交水稻由三系改为两系，生产程序由复杂变得简单；在增产效益上，全国目前的１．８４亿亩杂交稻可每亩在４２２公斤的水平上增产５％，应用这种两系籼粳亚种间的杂交优势，１９９２年至２０００年，两系杂交稻每亩将比现在的三系稻增产２０％左右，也意味着全国的４．８亿万亩水稻将比目前的普通水稻每亩增产４０％左右。
