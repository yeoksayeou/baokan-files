The United States has yet to clearly state whether it will recognize the interim government established by the Afghan resistance forces.

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency in Washington on February 24, U.S. State Department spokesman Redman said today that the establishment of an interim government by the Afghan resistance forces is "an encouraging development in the process of Afghan self-determination." However, he did not explicitly state whether the United States is prepared to recognize this interim government.

When asked if the United States recognizes this interim government, Redman said that establishing diplomatic relations with any country involves considering a series of standards.

　　是否承认阿临时政府
    美国尚未明确表示
    据新华社华盛顿２月２４日电  美国国务院发言人雷德曼今天说，阿富汗抵抗力量建立临时政府是阿富汗自决进程“一个令人鼓舞的发展”，但他没有明确表示，美国是否准备承认这一临时政府。
