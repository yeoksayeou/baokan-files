	Improve Quality, Protect Key Projects, Adjust Structure
	Automobile Production to be Significantly Reduced This Year
	First Automobile Works and Shanghai Volkswagen Join Hands to Promote Indigenization

	BEIJING, Feb. 21 (Xinhua) — The People's Daily reporters Li Anding and Lin Gang report: China's automobile production this year will be significantly reduced, adopting a policy of selective development to produce high-quality, market-oriented automobile products and ensure the construction of key projects.

	Chairman Cai Shiqing of the China Automobile Industry Association recently told reporters that this year's planned automobile production is 510,000 vehicles, a reduction of 137,000 vehicles from last year's 647,000. This is a good opportunity to adjust the product structure. While curbing the production of low-quality, high-priced, low-material-efficiency, and high-energy-consuming products, and strictly prohibiting the production of assembled vehicles, the automobile industry will expand the production of imported substitute sedans, jeeps, high-end tourist cars, and heavy-duty special vehicles; increase the production of famous-brand products and export automobile products, striving to achieve over $100 million in export earnings; and arrange for the mass production of indigenous components for imported models.

	To curb the chaotic situation where some localities are vying to start automobile projects, especially sedan projects, the state has decided to strengthen the examination and approval of automobile production and technical projects, and entrusted the China Automobile Industry Association to conduct industry management and macro-control.

	SHANGHAI, Feb. 21 (The People's Daily) — Reporter Xiao Guangen reports: The Shanghai branch of China Liberation Automobile Trade Company was recently established in Shanghai. The First Automobile Works and Shanghai Volkswagen Automobile Company have decided to join hands to accelerate the process of automobile indigenization.

	The "Santana" produced by Shanghai Volkswagen and the "Audi" produced by First Automobile Works are both imported from the same German company. Achieving indigenization is a common goal for both factories. The indigenization rate of the "Santana" has reached 30.6%, and it is planned to reach 50% this year. The indigenization rate of the "Audi" is expected to reach 80% by 1991. Joint production can avoid duplicate imports and redundant indigenization layouts.

	It is reported that the "Audi" and "Santana" share 20% of common parts. Therefore, they will negotiate with Shanghai Volkswagen to fully utilize the common parts of the indigenized "Santana" and install them on the "Audi."

　　上水平　保重点　调结构
    汽车产量今年大幅压缩       
    一汽同上海大众公司携手致力国产化
    本报北京２月２１日讯  新华社记者李安定、本报记者林钢报道：我国汽车产量今年将大幅度压缩，以有保有压的倾斜政策发展高水平、适销对路的汽车产品和确保重点项目的建设。
    中国汽车工业联合会代理事长蔡诗晴日前对记者说，今年汽车工业的计划产量为５１万辆，比去年的６４．７万辆减少１３．７万辆。这是一个调整产品结构的良好时机。在抑制劣质价高、材料利用率低、能耗高的产品产量，严厉制止拼装车辆生产的同时，汽车工业将扩大生产替代进口的轿车、吉普车、高级旅游车、重型专用车生产；增产名牌产品和出口汽车产品，力争出口创汇超过一亿美元；安排好引进车型国产化零部件大批量生产。
    为了抑制一些地方纷纷争上汽车项目特别是争上轿车项目的混乱状况，国家已确定，加强汽车生产建设项目和技术项目的立项审查，并责成中汽联进行行业管理和宏观调控。
    本报上海２月２１日电　记者萧关根报道：中国解放汽车贸易公司上海经销部日前在上海成立，长春第一汽车制造厂和上海大众汽车公司决心为加快轿车国有化进程携手共进。
    上海大众汽车公司生产的“桑塔纳”和一汽生产的“奥地”都是引进的西德同一公司的产品。实现国产化是两厂共同的课题。“桑塔纳”的国产化率已达到３０．６％，今年要达到５０％。“奥地”的国产化率１９９１年要达到８０％。联合生产可避免重复引进和国产化的重复布点。
    据介绍，“奥地”和“桑塔纳”有２０％的通用件，因此，他们要与上海大众协商，要充分利用桑塔纳的国产化通用件，装到“奥地”上去。
