Title: Bush: Stepping Out of Reagan's Shadow

U.S. President Bush has been in office for a month. How does he look today? Has he stepped out of Reagan's shadow? During last year's election, the media often described him as having "no political vision." He had difficulty defending himself. In fact, he didn't need to. According to his aides, when the Reagan-Bush ticket won in 1980, Bush had already made it clear that he would serve as Vice President with his head down and his mouth shut.

It was not until Bush took the reins of the White House that this intention was personally confirmed by him: "If I (as Vice President) said something that only hurt myself, that was one thing. But if I spoke and hurt the President, I would be extremely uncomfortable. This made me very cautious, because I did not want to do such a thing as Vice President," but "if it is concluded from this that I have no views or opinions, that is completely wrong." Indeed, since his election in early November last year, Bush has been a different person from when he was Vice President, and his personality has gradually become distinct.

A Strong Elbow
In November last year, then Secretary of State Shultz refused to issue a visa for Arafat to attend the UN General Assembly in the United States. Almost everyone in the U.S. said this was a blunder. At the time, Reagan was vacationing in California and "did not involve himself in the matter." Bush's spokesman had no choice but to say: "As a member of the cabinet, he supports this decision." The reluctance was obvious. There were also reports that Bush privately found this decision surprising and disappointing, calling it a "very stupid mistake."

As the elected President, Bush was no longer willing to compromise as before. He pressured Shultz to "soften" the State Department and demanded that Reagan personally "involve himself." Shultz finally changed his attitude and announced that the United States had decided to engage in "substantive dialogue" with the PLO. This is a "major change in U.S. Middle East policy." The media said that one of the reasons for the 180-degree turn in U.S. policy was that Bush gave Shultz "a nudge."

A Light Slash
When the election victory was secured, Bush naturally no longer needed to lower his head or keep quiet. The inauguration ceremony at the White House was over, and Bush, full of confidence, began to show his personality. On February 9, in the new government's first budget—the 1990 fiscal year budget—Bush took the initiative to freeze the military budget for one year and made a small cut in defense spending—the first cut—reducing Reagan's January 9 proposal by $2.6 billion.

A Practical Team
The cabinet team Bush selected also reflects his long-standing pragmatic style. The media believes that Bush's new cabinet has several characteristics: First, there are many old hands in the bureaucracy. According to statistics, more than 80% of the new cabinet members are old hands. Except for the White House Chief of Staff Sununu, economic advisor Boskin, and Commerce Secretary Mosbacher, the other important cabinet members had all served as high officials or congressmen in the previous three Republican administrations.

Second, there are many connections in Congress. Vice President Quayle, nominee for Secretary of Defense Tower, and Treasury Secretary Brady had all served as congressmen; Budget Director Darman was the main negotiator for tax plans during the six years before Reagan's presidency and was very familiar with Capitol Hill; Labor Secretary Dole is the wife of Senate Republican leader Dole; Secretary of State Baker, upon taking office, advocated that diplomatic decisions should return to the pre-Vietnam War era of bipartisan support, which was highly praised by Congress. These arrangements are hard to say are unintentional. Bush's Republican Party is in the minority in Congress, and this imbalance must be compensated for in some way. Bush himself also showed a cooperative attitude towards Congress: "Just call me George," using his first name at least feels closer than "Mr. President."

Third, there are many experts. Secretary of State Baker served under Reagan for more than seven years and was always involved in the decision-making of important political and economic strategic issues; National Security Advisor Scowcroft served as Ford's National Security Advisor, and Bush had served under him as the Director of the CIA; nominee for Secretary of Defense Tower's resume includes Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee and Chief U.S. Negotiator for Strategic Arms Talks with the Soviet Union, and he is well-versed in defense and national security issues. In the economic field, Treasury Secretary Brady is an expert in the stock market; Chairman of the Economic Advisory Committee Boskin is knowledgeable about taxes and social security issues, and his proposal to reduce the budget deficit through "flexible freezing" was a timely help for Bush during the election; Budget Director Darman is a key figure in amending U.S. tax laws, and his Senate colleagues also praise him as "a good hand."

A Slightly Different Tone
Soon after the new team took office, people felt a "fresh breeze" blowing. Nominee for Secretary of Defense Tower spoke the truth in Congress: he and Bush believe that Reagan's Star Wars plan is "unrealistic." For the Strategic Defense Initiative, which Reagan cherished, Bush may not be so fond of it.

Scowcroft has long differed with Reagan on issues such as arms control, and he has repeatedly complained that Reagan has gone too far and too fast in reducing weapons. As soon as Reagan's words about the thaw between the U.S. and the Soviet Union were heard, Scowcroft warned: "The Cold War is not over." Bush also repeatedly emphasized: "We do not need to be anxious just because General Secretary Gorbachev proposed a series of very interesting suggestions at the United Nations," "reviewing national security policies and diplomatic policy goals is a serious matter," and to "be cautious" and "not act rashly." These statements left much to ponder for those observing U.S.-Soviet relations.

Since President Bush took office, a light drizzle has been falling over the White House, gradually erasing "Reagan's shadow." Bush is in charge and begins to make decisions on his own. How people will evaluate this new president in the next four years, no one dares to predict at this moment. Perhaps, people will find that Bush's "stature" is not inferior to Reagan's.

### 布什：走出里根影子

　　布什：走出里根影子
    陈功
    美国总统布什执政已“满月”。他今朝形象如何？从“里根影子”里走出来了吗？去年大选，舆论说他最多的是：“无政治主见”。他则有口难辩。其实，也不需自辩。据他的助手透露，１９８０年里根—布什搭档获胜时，布什就有言在先，要低着头、闭着嘴当副总统。
    直到布什坐上了白宫第一把交椅之后，这个意思才得到他亲口印证：“我（作为副总统）如果说了什么只伤害我自己的话，那是一码事。但如果我出口伤害了总统，我则会极度不安。这使我小心异常，因为我不想在副总统位上做出这等事来”，但“若据此便断言，我无观点无主见，实在大谬不然”。确实，自去年１１月初当选以来，布什已与当副总统时判若两人，个性逐渐分明了。
    　　　　有劲儿的一肘子
    去年１１月间，当时的国务卿舒尔茨拒绝签发阿拉法特赴美参加联大会议的入境签证。美国朝野几乎皆曰：此一败着。当时，里根在加州度假，“未过问此事”。布什的发言人不得已称：“作为内阁一员，他支持这项决定。”勉为其难，显而易见。另有消息透露，布什私下里对这一决定是意外再加失望，称它是个“非常愚蠢的错误”。
    作为当选总统的布什再不像以往那样愿意妥协了。他向舒尔茨施加压力，力促国务院“软化”，并要求里根亲自“过问”。舒尔茨终于前倨后恭，宣布美国决定与巴解组织进行“实质性对话”。这是“美国中东政策的一个重大变化”。舆论说，美国政策１８０度大转弯的原因之一是布什给了舒尔茨“一胳膊肘子”。
    　　　　轻轻的一刀子
    当竞选胜局已定，布什自然毋需再低眉、噤言。白宫的登基大典奏完终曲，布什踌躇满志，个性就崭露出来了。２月９日，在新政府的第一个财政预算——１９９０财政年度预算中，布什主动冻结军事预算１年，并且在防务开支上小小地割了第一刀——把里根１月９日提出的方案削减了２６亿美元。
    　　　　务实的一班子
    布什选定的内阁班子也很能反映他一向务实的风格。舆论认为，布什新内阁有几个特点：一曰官场老手多。据统计，新内阁成员的８０％以上系老手。除了白宫办公厅主任苏努努、经济顾问博斯金、商务部长莫斯巴赫尔之外，其他重要阁员都曾在前三任共和党政府内当过高官或任过议员。
    二曰国会网络广。奎尔副总统、提名国防部长托尔和财长布雷迪都当过国会议员；预算局长达曼曾是里根执政前６年里的税收计划主要谈判代表，对国会山了如指掌；劳工部长多尔女士是参议院共和党领袖多尔的内人；国务卿贝克上任伊始就主张外交决策应回到越战前两党支持的时代，因而颇得国会喝彩。上述安排很难说是无意的。布什所属的共和党在国会是少数派，这种不平衡总得设法弥补。布什自己也向国会表示出合作姿态：“就叫我乔治吧”，直呼其名至少在耳感上要比“总统先生”近乎些。
    三曰行家里手多。国务卿贝克任职里根麾下七年多，一直参与重要的政治经济战略问题的决策；国家安全顾问斯考克罗夫特当过福特总统的国家安全顾问，布什当年还在他的手下任过中央情报局长呢；提名国防部长托尔的履历表中，有参议院军事委员会主席和美苏战略武器谈判美方首席代表等记录，他通晓防务和国家安全问题。在经济方面，财长布雷迪是股票市场专家；经济顾问委员会主席博斯金长于税收、社会保险问题，他提出的靠“灵活冻结”来减少预算赤字的意见为竞选中的布什雪中送炭；预算局长达曼是修改美国税法的关键人物，参院同行也赞他“是一把好手”。
    　　　　略带差异的调子
    新班底就位不久，人们便感到“清新之风”习习而来。提名国防部长托尔在国会吐真言：他和布什认为，里根的星球大战计划“不现实”。对里根视为宠物的战略防御计划，布什眼里未必那么中意。
    斯考克罗夫特素来在军备控制等问题上与里根意见相左，他多次抱怨里根在削减武器问题上走得太远、太快。里根关于美苏之间坚冰已破的话音刚落，斯考克罗夫特则警告：“冷战尚未结束”。布什也反复重申：“我们不必因戈尔巴乔夫总书记在联合国提出了一系列非常令人感兴趣的建议而坐立不安”，“我们审查国家安全政策和外交政策目标是件严肃的事”，要“谨慎”，而“不想轻率行事”。这些表示给观察苏美关系的人留下不少思考题。
    布什总统就职后，白宫飘来阵阵毛毛雨，渐渐地在抹去“里根的影子”。布什大权在握，开始独自决断。未来四年，人们如何评说这位新总统，眼下谁也不敢逆料。也许，人们会发现，布什的“个头”原来并不亚于里根。
