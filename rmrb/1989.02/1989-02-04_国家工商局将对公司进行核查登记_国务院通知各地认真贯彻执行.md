The State Administration for Industry and Commerce will conduct company inspection and reregistration. The State Council has recently approved and forwarded the "Opinions on Several Issues Regarding Company Annual Inspection and Reregistration" by the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, and notified all regions to implement it earnestly.

The State Administration for Industry and Commerce has stipulated nine "musts":

1. Companies must be entities that are separate from the government, operate independently, and can independently assume civil liabilities. Except for a few companies directly authorized by the State Council to perform certain administrative management tasks, other companies must not have government administrative management functions.

2. Companies must strictly comply with the relevant regulations of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the State Council that party and government officials in office are not allowed to hold concurrent positions in companies.

3. Companies must be financially and materially independent from party and government organs, and must submit proof from the financial department.

4. Company names must comply with state regulations. Those that do not comply must be changed and approved by the industrial and commercial administrative authorities; those using the words "China," "Chinese," or "International" must be re-approved by the State Administration for Industry and Commerce.

5. Registered capital of companies must comply with state regulations and match the actual capital. State-owned companies must submit proof documents from the financial department; collectively-owned companies, and companies with state, collective, and individual investments, must submit capital verification certificates from registered accounting firms or audit firms. For companies with special state regulations, the special regulations will be followed.

6. The scope of business of companies must comply with state laws, regulations, and policies.

7. Companies must have personnel who comply with state regulations and are suitable for their production, operation, and service scale. Companies must, according to their business needs, employ professional and technical personnel and financial accountants, and submit qualification certificates.

8. Companies must pay taxes according to law. Companies must submit their tax registration certificates and recent tax payment receipts.

9. Companies must engage in business activities according to law. Companies that have been investigated by relevant departments for illegal activities and whose cases have not been closed yet, will have their annual inspections and reregistrations postponed; those whose cases have been closed must submit the handling documents from the relevant departments.

The work of company annual inspection and reregistration will begin on February 15th of this year and end by June 30th.

    据新华社北京２月３日电  国务院最近批转国家工商行政管理局《关于公司年检和重新登记注册若干问题的意见》，并通知各地认真贯彻执行。
    国家工商局规定了９个“必须”：
    一、公司必须是政企分开、自主经营、能够独立承担民事责任的经济实体。除经国务院直接授权极少数公司承担某些行政管理工作外，其他公司一律不得兼有政府行政管理职能。
    二、公司必须严格遵守中共中央、国务院关于党政机关在职干部不得在公司兼职的有关规定。
    三、公司必须在财务和物资上与党政机关脱钩，并提交财政部门出具的证明。
    四、公司名称必须符合国家规定。凡不符合规定的，应予更改，报工商行政管理机关核定；凡使用“中国”、“中华”、“国际”字样的，必须报国家工商行政管理局重新核定。
    五、公司注册资金必须符合国家规定，并与实有资金相符。全民所有制的公司，应提交由财政部门出具的证明文件；集体所有制的公司，国家、集体与个人投资、入股的公司，应提交由注册会计师事务所或审计事务所出具的验资证明。国家有专项规定的，按专项规定办理。
    六、公司的经营范围必须符合国家法律、法规和政策的规定。
    七、公司必须有符合国家规定并与其生产经营和服务规模相适应的从业人员。公司应根据其业务需要，配备专业技术人员和财务会计人员，并提交资格证明。
    八、公司必须依法纳税。公司须提交税务登记证和近期纳税交款书。
    九、公司必须依法从事经营活动。公司因违法行为被有关部门立案查处，尚未结案的，暂缓办理年检和重新登记注册；已经结案的，应提交有关部门出具的处理文书。
    公司年检和重新登记注册工作从今年２月１５日开始进行，６月３０日前结束。
