China and Japan have had a close cultural exchange relationship since ancient times. As a bond of this exchange, Chinese poetry began to spread in the Japanese imperial court as early as the 7th century, thus marking the beginning of an enduring tradition of poetic exchange between the two countries. The book "Selected and Annotated Poems of Sino-Japanese Exchange," published by Spring Wind Art Publishing House, is a new work that reflects the history of literary exchange between China and Japan.

Firstly, this selection provides a relatively comprehensive overview of the ancient Sino-Japanese poetic exchange. The annotator follows the historical trajectory of Sino-Japanese cultural exchange, selecting over 300 poems from more than 200 poets. Important authors and outstanding poems that highlight the main themes have been thoroughly collected. The selected poets include scholars, emperors, officials, envoys, travelers, monks, merchants, and others, succinctly showcasing the broad scope of poetic exchange between the two countries.

Secondly, this selection gathers valuable materials on the history of Sino-Japanese cultural exchange. Although there are many monumental works on this subject, due to the passage of time and the loss of historical records, many materials still await discovery and organization. The annotator took advantage of teaching in Japan to conduct painstaking and meticulous research, uncovering many materials that have not been noticed by Chinese scholars. This pioneering selection and compilation will undoubtedly be of great reference value for scholars studying the history of Sino-Japanese relations.

Lastly, the annotations in this book are concise and precise, appealing to both scholars and general readers. The annotator's scholarship is rigorous, and every word is carefully considered. For obscure words and phrases, the annotator has thoroughly researched their origins, providing well-founded explanations. This makes the book accessible to both those with deep knowledge and those who are new to the subject. Professor Gong Mu, an esteemed poet, wrote in the preface to this book: “A long rainbow connects the seas and mountains, poetic sentiments span a thousand years between East and West.” It is hoped that this book will serve as a bridge connecting the hearts and poetic sentiments of the Chinese and Japanese peoples.

　　读《中日交往汉诗选注》
    窦其文
    中日两国自古以来就存在着密切的文化交流关系。作为这种交流纽带的汉诗，早在公元七世纪，就已经在日本宫廷中流行起来，从而在中日文化交流史上出现了至今不绝的汉诗交往的局面。由春风文艺出版社出版的《中日交往汉诗选注》，就是反映中日文学交流历史的新著。
    首先，这一选本比较全面地反映了古代中日汉诗交往的概貌。注者沿着中日文化交流的历史轨迹，择取了２００余位诗家的３００多首诗，有关标举主题的重要作家与优秀诗篇，基本上都旁搜罗致了。所收作家，包括了诗人、学者、帝王、将相、使节、游客、僧侣、商贾等，要而不繁地显示出两国汉诗交往的广泛性。
    其次，这一选本搜集了中日文化交流史方面的珍贵资料。在中日文化交流史方面，虽然不少煌煌巨著，但由于时代的久远，史料的散佚，有关资料至今还有许多尚待挖掘清理。本书注者利用执教东瀛之机，进行了艰苦细致的勾沉辑佚工作。不少中国学者未曾瞩目的资料赖以得窥一斑。这种具备拓荒性质的选裁择录，对于研究中日关系史的学者同仁来说，无疑具有不可低估的参考价值。
    再次，此书注释简要精练，雅俗共赏。注者治学严谨，落笔慎重，凡生僻词句，大都穷本寻源，持说有故，使学识渊博者读之未觉为繁，初入门庭者不以为简。老诗人公木教授在为本书所题的诗中写道：“一道长虹绾海岳，诗情千载结西东。”但愿此书成为沟通中日民心诗情的一座桥梁。
