If you are new to Shenyang and do not know the way, or if you want to buy something but do not know where to find it, just pick up the phone and dial "730" twice. These problems will be easily solved.

"730730" is the telephone information service center that Shenyang City opened last year. Before going to interview, the reporter had dialed this number, pretending to ask for directions. The service staff not only told which bus to take but also described in detail the direction to walk after getting off the bus. When asked where to buy a piano, the reply was that the market only has the Fuxing piano produced in Yingkou, and it also told where to buy the 115 type and where to buy the 120 type.

It is understood that telephone information services are already quite common in developed regions abroad, and several large cities in China have also successively opened telephone information services. This information service center uses computers to store a large amount of information and can generally answer questions immediately. If they cannot answer a question immediately, they will take responsibility to find the answer.

"730730" has already gained a certain reputation in Shenyang. Every day, more than 400 people use the phone to inquire about various matters, and just the inquiries about directions alone average more than 80 times a day, all feeling that it saves time and effort.

　　到了沈阳有疑难  请拨两次“七三○”
    据新华社沈阳２月２７日电  （记者马义）初来沈阳不识路径，想买东西货源不清，只需拿起电话，连拨两次“７３０”，这些难题就很容易解决了。
    “７３０７３０”是沈阳市去年开设的电话信息服务台。记者去采访前曾拨过这个号码，佯作问路。执机的７号服务员不仅告诉该坐哪路车，还详述了下车后朝哪个方向步行；又问哪儿可以买到钢琴，回答说市场上只有营口产幸福钢琴，还告诉哪儿卖１１５型，哪儿卖１２０型。
    据了解，电话信息服务在国外发达地区已比较普遍，国内也有几家大城市陆续开办了电话信息业务。这个信息服务台用电子计算机储存了大量信息，一般情况下可以做到随问随答。一时回答不了的，他们也会负责到底。
    “７３０７３０”目前在沈阳已有了一定的名气，每天有４００多人次用电话询问有关事宜，仅问路电话就日均８０多次，皆感省时省力。
