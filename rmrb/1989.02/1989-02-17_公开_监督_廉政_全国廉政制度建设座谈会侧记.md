Just after the Spring Festival, leaders responsible for clean government construction from various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, along with relevant personnel, gathered in Beijing's Jingxi Hotel to discuss current issues in the construction of clean government institutions. People came with the lingering excitement of the festival, and in their conversations, it seemed that this year's Spring Festival was better than last year's. There was a noticeable reduction in banquets and gift-giving, and the trend of "publicly funded New Year celebrations" had weakened. Among the firecrackers, there were fewer incidents of fires and injuries compared to previous years. Since the central government proposed "rectifying the economic environment and rectifying the economic order," people's rational judgment has increased, and spontaneous irrational behavior has been constrained, leading to an improvement in social customs.

To both prosper the economy and practice clean politics is one of the fundamental characteristics of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and is also the goal for which Chinese Communists strive. Easier said than done, of course. The past few years of practice have shown that our economy has indeed developed, but it has also revealed some problems that are not entirely satisfactory. The main manifestations are that, in the context of an increasingly active commodity economy, administrative behavior, market behavior, and enterprise behavior have not yet been strictly regulated through legal means. Consequently, some individuals in departments that exercise state power and manage public affairs have used their authority to engage in overt or covert acts of power abuse, extortion, bribery, misappropriation of public funds, and even corruption, thereby undermining party discipline and social customs and causing public dissatisfaction.

The root cause of some corrupt practices

How did these phenomena arise? Why were there fewer such issues during the past single-track planned economy, but after the initial development of the commodity economy and the formation of the dual-track system, these issues emerged? Participants, in conjunction with Shandong Province's Yantai City's exploration of clean government construction, discussed the establishment of a new socialist commodity order. They clearly recognized that for the current corrupt practices, merely conducting an isolated analysis or attributing them to individual character, feudal remnants, bourgeois corruption, or external influences brought by openness, although these explanations have some merit, they do not identify the deepest underlying cause. In fact, reform has led to an increasing number of economic activities entering the market track. A significant portion of the management domain has deviated from the government's familiar space, while the government's organizational structure, functional allocation, and power utilization methods still retain characteristics of the single-product economic system. Government departments control substantial material allocation rights, financial control rights, product pricing rights, and personnel management rights. In this situation, the administrative mechanism and the law of value both come into play, but neither has found its respective track. The government and various operators may both participate in economic activities while straddling two tracks. This makes it easy for moneyed operators and powerless government officials to engage in power-for-money transactions, leading to phenomena such as buying power with money or exchanging money for power. This is the deepest root cause of some corrupt practices in the initial stage of commodity economy development.

Participants believe that clarifying this approach is crucial for solving current problems. Traditionally and habitually, we often use two methods to address issues like corruption: one is to strengthen positive education, raise awareness, correct understanding, enhance self-awareness, and promote morality; the other is to launch campaigns, exposing and dealing with those who are unjust and illegal through campaigns. Today, these two methods are still effective, and in clean government construction, we must continue to strengthen ideological education while also investigating and handling some cases. However, relying solely on these two methods is insufficient. The primary focus should be on strengthening institutional construction, establishing the institution's own checks and balances, and the public's supervision mechanism. The practice has proven that the Central Political System Reform Research Office's guidance over the past two years for various regions to conduct pilot work on clean government institution construction has indeed grasped the key to exploring and solving this problem.

Bringing clean government into the democratic political track

At the conference, 12 units made key speeches, including those introducing the situation of the entire province, a city's practices, a department's experience, and how to break through in a bustling urban area. Summarizing these speeches, the most significant achievements in clean government institution construction in various places are "transparency" and "supervision," that is, through improving institutional construction, bringing clean government into the democratic political track.

The content of "transparency" includes one transparency (outcome of handling affairs), two transparencies (institutions and outcomes of handling affairs), and even three, four, or five transparencies, including the procedures for handling affairs, the names and responsibilities of the handlers, and the rewards, punishments, and appeals of the handlers, all of which are disclosed to the public. Whether officials are impartial, what rights the public has, and who to complain to for handling affairs are all clear. Those who intend to do wrong dare not make moves, while those who handle affairs according to law and regulations are confident. Zhang Erchen, the Party secretary of Xiancheng County in Hebei Province, shared two stories in his speech. One is the "second-child" quota for family planning. In the past, some officials could give it to whomever they wanted, and the reasons for giving it to Zhang San but not Li Si were arbitrary. Now, the conditions for having a second child are made public, and the applicant's photo is also posted, making it clear whether the child is disabled or not. Another is the allocation of homestead land. In the past, village officials decided, and there were many drawbacks. Now, the principles and methods of allocation are made public, and village self-governing organizations discuss them. Village officials dare not be unfair, and they do not dare to be unfair anymore.

Transparency should start with issues that the public cares about the most, has the most complaints about, and has the most prominent contradictions. Participants were interested in the practices of Yanzhou County in Shandong Province. Originally, there were many complaints from the public about the allocation of fertilizers. Due to the lack of public disclosure of supply quotas, officials at all levels issued vouchers, and farmers could not buy subsidized fertilizers. County officials dared not go to the countryside. After 1987, they implemented the method of "three lists on the wall, one certificate to the household, and delivery to the village," making it clear to the public how much fertilizer they should buy and where to buy it, leaving no room for fraud. The Agricultural Bank of Heilongjiang Province believes that their practice of publicizing agricultural loans and achieving results over the past few years was forced by the situation. Before the reform of the countryside, the bank's service objects were 600,000 production teams across the province. After the reform, it became 3.8 million rural households, increasing the workload and dispersing the work surface, making management more difficult. Farmers need to buy fertilizers, purchase seeds, add cars, build houses, and engage in business, and their demand for funds is urgent. Under the same conditions, whoever gets the funds first gets rich first, and the contradiction between supply and demand for funds is becoming increasingly prominent, providing opportunities for those who use power (loans) for personal gain. Some staff members took advantage of their work to engage in malpractices, lending favors, accepting interest, taking kickbacks, entering good stocks, and even extorting bribes. According to the investigations of 1984 and 1985, the province had 5,396 cases of using loans for personal gain, totaling 19.7 million yuan, involving 1,723 employees, and farmers had strong reactions. How to solve this problem? Campaigns to rectify discipline, party rectification, and cracking down on major cases, a batch was caught, and a batch was removed. Many methods were tried, but the effect was not significant. The facts made the leaders of the provincial agricultural bank realize that relying solely on internal forces was not enough. They had to rely on social forces and mobilize the broad masses of farmers to supervise. Therefore, the entire bank implemented the method of "publicizing loan objects, loan purposes, and loan amounts," and later improved the policy of publicizing the issuance, interest rates, recovery, and handling of illegal and disciplinary actions. The principle of transparency made the development and construction of the provincial agricultural bank enter the regular track.

The purpose of transparency is to promote institutional construction and increase the transparency of handling affairs, making it convenient for the public to supervise. In the past, public supervision was also emphasized, but the details of the matter were not disclosed to the public, making supervision an empty phrase. To achieve supervision based on transparency, various pilot units have come up with some methods. Xiancheng County has taken four measures: ① The county supervision bureau has set up a reporting center, administrative departments, towns, and villages have set up complaint boxes, and the public has a way to report; ② Supervision organizations have been set up in departments such as taxation, agricultural banks, commerce, and public security that directly interact with the public; ③ An institution for receiving letters and visits has been established; ④ Government departments have set up political and disciplinary supervisors, and the entire county implements two "transparency weeks" every year, making everything that should be disclosed public. Fujian Province's "two transparencies and one supervision" pilot proposes "establishing a complete supervision system, including party supervision, administrative supervision, legal supervision, public supervision, public opinion supervision, and supervision of supervisors."

The pilot work has been effective

Through transparency, supervision, improving institutional construction, and solving clean government issues, this approach is welcomed and recognized by the public. Beijing conducted a pilot in the Dongcheng District, which is a concentrated area of bustling places such as Wangfujing and Tiananmen Square. Shanghai conducted a pilot in the Huangpu District, which is famous worldwide, and the effects were good. Beijing's Dongcheng District issued 1,000 questionnaires, and 80% were satisfied with this work; Shanghai's Huangpu District also issued 1,000 questionnaires, and 95% were satisfied or basically satisfied. After Beijing's Dongcheng District publicized the handling institutions, the public in Xicheng and Fengtai districts also copied them and prepared to negotiate with local relevant departments. To make the publicized institutions easy for the public to understand, some places compiled small booklets, with each resident receiving one, and every problem from birth to death has clear regulations and solutions. After Heilongjiang Province's agricultural bank implemented transparency and supervision, not only did it complete the tasks well every year, but it also recovered the past 280 million yuan of overdue loans.

Regarding the "seven departments and eight departments," some people initially worried that after implementing transparent handling, would it affect their enthusiasm? Would spitting on the ground go unchecked, and would traffic chaos go unchecked? Like what Beijing people say, "only smiling but not enforcing the law," the current situation is "smiling, enforcing the law, and handling affairs," indicating that the quality of our cadres is basically good. Shanghai's Huangpu District organized the public to evaluate officials based on the results of transparent handling. Excellent officials receive 12 yuan per month, fairly good officials receive 6 yuan, those who are qualified do not receive any reward, and those who are not qualified are deemed unfit to continue this work and are directed to find another path. The practice result is that only 3% of officials are not qualified. This small amount of "local grain tickets" indicates that in the process of transparent handling, it is necessary to appropriately use economic means.

What is clean government institution construction? Initially, everyone felt that this concept was unclear. After a few days of discussion, the conference summarized it as follows: clean government institution construction is to make the government's management behavior adapt to the needs of developing socialist commodity economy and enter the track of standardization and transparency. This is an important part of building socialist democratic politics in our country. In the long term, people have seen hope in "prospering the economy and maintaining clean politics." Of course, the current experiments are still partial and point-based. In the future, how to promote them, how to combine points and faces, and how to coordinate upper and lower levels and unified action between regions and departments, there is still a lot of work to be done. However, a large amount of evidence shows that these pilots have significant value and meaning for the "surface."

　　公开·监督·廉政
   　——全国廉政制度建设座谈会侧记
    本报记者  吴昊
    春节刚过，各省、市、自治区负责廉政建设的领导同志和有关的工作人员就来到了北京京西宾馆，对当前的廉政制度建设问题进行座谈。人们带着节日的余兴而来，言谈中似乎都觉得今年的春节比去年过得好，请客送礼的明显减少，“公费过年”的势头减弱，鞭炮声中失火、伤身的事情也少于往年。自从中央提出“治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序”以后，人们的理智判断增强、自发的盲目性受到制约，社会风气开始得到净化。
    既要繁荣经济，又要实行廉洁政治。这是建设具有中国特色的社会主义的根本标志之一，也是中国共产党人为之奋斗的目标。话说来容易，做起来当然是很难的。这几年的实践证明，我们的经济确实发展了，但也确实出现了一些不能尽如人意的问题。主要表现为，在商品经济日趋活跃的情况下，行政行为、市场行为和企业行为都还没有通过法制的形式得到严格的规范，因而使得一些行使国家权力和管理公共事务的部门中的少数人，利用手中的权力，或明或暗地进行弄权勒索、贪污受贿、假公济私甚至腐化堕落，败坏了党风和社会风气，造成了群众的不满。
    　　　　产生某些腐败现象的最根本原因
    这种现象是怎么产生的，为什么在过去计划经济的单一轨道的情况下这种现象比较少，而当商品经济初步发展、双轨制初步形成以后，出现了这种现象？与会者结合山东省烟台市关于建立社会主义商品新秩序探索廉政建设的路子进行了讨论，比较明确地认识到，对于目前的某些腐败现象，仅仅进行就事论事的分析、孤立地归结于个人的品质或归结为封建思想的遗毒和资产阶级思想的腐蚀，归结为实行开放带来的外部影响等，虽然都有一定道理，但都没有找出最深层的原因。事实上，改革使得越来越多的经济活动开始纳入了市场轨道，很大一部分管理领域游离出政府驾轻就熟的空间，而政府目前的机构组织、职能配置和权力运用方式等，又还保留着单一产品经济体制时的特征，政府部门控制着相当大的物资分配权、资金控制权、产品定价权、人事管理权等，在这种情况下，行政机制和价值规律同时起作用，却又都没有找到各自应该遵循的轨道，政府和各经营主体都可能骑在两种轨道中间参与经济活动，这样一些有钱无权的经营者与有权无钱的政府官员之间，就容易发生权钱交易，出现拿钱买权或以权换钱的现象。这是在商品经济初步发展的情况下，所以产生某些腐败现象的最深刻的根源。
    与会者认为，对于解决当前的问题明确这一思路十分重要。按照过去的传统和习惯，解决腐败现象之类的问题，我们往往采用两种办法，一是加强正面教育，提高觉悟，端正认识，提高自觉性，发扬道德的作用；二是搞运动，通过运动把那些不公不法者揭露出来，进行处理。今天这两条虽然依旧在起作用，在廉政建设中依然要加强思想教育，同时对一些案件进行举报、查证、处理。但仅有这两条是不行的，更主要的着眼点，应该是加强制度建设，建立制度本身的制衡机制和群众的监督机制。事实证明，中央政治体制改革研究室近两年来引导各地进行廉政制度建设的试点工作，正是抓住了探索和解决这个问题的根本。
    　　　　把廉政纳入民主政治轨道
    在座谈会上进行重点发言的，共有１２个单位，有介绍全省情况的，有介绍一个市的做法的，有介绍一个部门经验的，也有的介绍在城市的繁华区道如何进行突破的。综合这些发言，各地在廉政制度建设上最主要的收获，一是“公开”，二是“监督”，即通过完善制度建设，把廉政纳入民主政治的轨道。
    “公开”的内容，有的是一公开（办事结果），有的是两公开（办事制度和办事结果），也有的是三公开、四公开、五公开，连同办事的程序、办事人的姓名、责任，对办事人的奖惩申述都向群众公布。干部是否秉公，群众自己有什么权利，要办事找谁投诉，一目了然，想干坏事的不敢做手脚，依法照章办事的理直气壮。河北省藁城县县委书记张二辰在发言时讲了两个故事，一个是计划生育的“二胎”指标，过去一些干部想给谁就给谁，为什么给张三不给李四，随意性很大，现在不行了，生二胎的条件公开，而且公布本人照片，妈妈抱着孩子，是否残疾，一看即知；再一个是宅基地的分配，过去是村干部说了算，弊端很多，现在把分配的原则、办法公开，而且要由村民自治组织进行讨论，村干部还敢不公道吗？不敢了。
    实行公开，要从群众最关心，意见最大、矛盾最突出的事情开始。与会者对山东省郯城县的做法感到兴趣。郯城县原来在化肥的分配上群众意见很大，由于供应指标不公开，各级干部层层批条子，走后门，农民买不到平价化肥，县里的干部不敢下乡，１９８７年以后，他们实行“三榜上墙、一证到户、送货到村”的办法，群众都知道自己应买多少化肥，到哪里去买，清清楚楚，谁也不能做假。中国农业银行黑龙江省分行认为他们这几年实行农贷公开并取得成绩，是被形势逼出来的。农村实行改革以前，农行的服务对象是全省６万个生产队，改革后，变成３８０万个农户，工作量增加，工作面分散，管理难度加大，农民要买肥购种、添车置马、建房起屋、办货经商，对资金的需求十分迫切，同样条件下谁先拿到货款谁先富，资金的供求矛盾日益突出，给一些以权（贷）谋私的人提供了可乘之机，一些工作人员利用工作之便营私舞弊，放人情款，收人情息，吃回扣，入好汉股，甚至索贿受贿，据１９８４和１９８５年两年的清查，全省共发生以贷谋私５３９６笔，合计金额１９７０万元，涉及职工１７２３人，农民反映十分强烈。怎么样解决这个问题呢？整纪刹风、整党、抓大要案，抓了一批，撤了一批，办法没少想，但效果并不明显，事实使省农行的领导认识到，单靠内部的力量不行，必须依靠社会力量，发动广大农民进行监督，于是在全行推行了“贷款对象公开、贷款用途公开、贷款数额公开”的办法，以后又把发放公开完善的政策公开、利率公开、回收公开和违法违纪处理公开的完备的制度。公开的原则使该省农行的发展建设走上了正规化的道路。
    公开的目的一是促进制度建设，二是增加办事透明度，方便群众监督。过去也曾强调群众监督，但事情的底细不让群众知道，监督成了一句空话。为了实现公开基础上的监督，各试点单位都想了一些办法，藁城县采取了四条措施，①县监察局设举报中心，行政部门、乡镇村设检举箱，群众举报有门；②在税收、农行、商业、公安等和群众直接接触的部门设监督组织；③建立来信来访接待日制度；④政府部门设政风政纪监督员，另外全县每年实行两个“公开旬”，把一切应当公开的事情全部公开。福建省的“两公开一监督”试点提出“建立完整的监督体系，包括党内监督、行政监督、法律监督、群众监督、舆论监督以及对监督者的监督等”。
    　　　　试点工作卓有成效
    通过公开、监督、完善制度建设、解决廉政问题，这条路子群众是欢迎的、认可的。北京在东城区进行试点，是王府井、天安门等闹市区的集中地点，上海在黄浦区试点，外滩、南京路，世界有名，效果都是好的。北京东城区发出１０００份问卷，８０％对这一工作满意；上海黄浦区也发出１０００份问卷，满意和基本满意的占９５％。北京市东城区公开了办事制度后，使得西城、丰台等区的群众都来抄，回去准备和当地有关部门交涉。为了使公开的制度便于群众掌握，有的地方汇制了小册子，居民人手一册，每个人从生到死各种问题都有明确的规定和解决途径。黑龙江省农行实行公开监督以后，不仅每年都很好地完成了任务，而且把过去的两亿八千万元陈贷也收回来了。
    对于“七所八所”，开始有人担心，实行公开办事以后，会不会影响他们的积极性，随地吐痰没人管了，交通混乱没人管了，像北京人说的“只微笑不执法”，实践证明，现在的情况是“又微笑，又执法，又办事”，说明我们的干部素质基本是好的。上海黄浦区根据公开办事的结果，组织群众对干部进行评议，优秀的，每月奖１２元钱，比较优秀的奖６元，称职的不奖，不称职的证明没有资格再干这个事情，另找出路。实践结果，只有３％的干部不称职。这很少一点的“地方粮票”，说明在办事公开的过程中，适当运用经济手段是必要的。
    什么叫廉政制度建设？开始时大家觉得这个概念不明确，经过几天座谈，会议概括出了这样一句话：廉政制度建设就是使政府的管理行为适应发展社会主义商品经济的需要，纳入规范化、公开化的轨道。这是我国建设社会主义民主政治的一个重要组成部分。从远景看，人们对“经济要繁荣，政治要廉洁”看到了希望。当然，目前的试验还是局部的、点上的，今后如何推广，如何点面结合，上下配套、条块统一行动，还有大量的工作要做。但大量的事实证明，这些试点对于“面”上的价值和意义是十分明显的。
