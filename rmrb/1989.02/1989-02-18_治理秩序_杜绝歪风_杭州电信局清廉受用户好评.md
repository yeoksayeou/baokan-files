The Hangzhou Telecommunications Bureau in Zhejiang Province has been praised by users for its integrity and clean governance during the installation, removal, and relocation of telephone lines.

In recent years, due to the tight supply and demand of telephones in Hangzhou, issues such as taking bribes, demanding gifts, delaying services, and extorting money have occasionally occurred during the installation process. To curb these malpractices, the Hangzhou Telecommunications Bureau, while strictly investigating and punishing violations of communication regulations, has also sent an open letter to over ten thousand users who have paid for but are awaiting telephone installation. The letter stipulates that bureau staff are not allowed to purchase scarce goods or demand gifts from users during the installation, removal, or relocation of telephone lines. They are also not allowed to request meals from users under any pretext or to privately undertake or participate in telecommunications projects outside the bureau. To accept public supervision, the bureau, while issuing "Bureau Wind Supervision Reply Cards" to users, has also set up a supervision hotline and dispatched discipline inspection and supervision personnel to visit users and actively solicit opinions.

The clean governance measures taken by the Hangzhou Telecommunications Bureau have not only improved installation efficiency but also significantly improved the industry's work ethic. From late October last year to the end of the year, 7,585 telephones were installed. Out of nearly 900 user "Bureau Wind Supervision Reply Cards" that have been returned, no instances of malpractices have been found.

　　治理秩序　杜绝歪风    
    杭州电信局清廉受用户好评
    本报讯  浙江省杭州市电信局在装拆移机过程中，清正廉洁，受到广大用户好评。
    近年来由于杭州市电话供需矛盾紧张，在安装过程中吃、拿、卡、要等不正之风时有发生。为刹住这股不正之风，杭州市电信局在从严查处违反通信纪律的同时，向全市已交费待装电话的上万个用户发出公开信，规定本局干部和职工不准利用装移机或代办工程之际向用户购买紧俏商品，索取财物；不准以任何理由或方式要求用户请吃；不准以各种方式在局外私自包揽或参加电信工程。为接受群众监督，电信局在向用户发放“局风监督回单”的同时，还设立了监督电话，并派出纪检、监察干部走访用户，主动征求意见。
    杭州市电信局采取的廉洁措施，既提高了装机效率，也促使行业风气有了明显好转。从去年１０月下旬到年底安装电话７５８５部，从已反馈的近９００份用户“局风监督回单”信中，没有发现一人搞任何不正之风。
