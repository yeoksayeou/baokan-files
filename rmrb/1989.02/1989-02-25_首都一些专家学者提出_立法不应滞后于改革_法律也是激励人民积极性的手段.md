The Institute of Law at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences recently held an academic discussion on "Chinese Legal Reform." More than 50 experts and scholars from the capital expressed their views on China's legal reform and the construction of a law-governed state.

Many scholars pointed out that the current chaos in construction and reform is closely related to the fact that legislation has not kept pace with the development of reform. Legislation should not "lag behind" reform but should "lead the way." Laws should be used to guarantee and guide reform. Since we lack experience and cannot immediately create all the necessary laws, we can adopt a policy of "borrowing." We can learn from the laws of other countries and Hong Kong, and use whatever is applicable to the development of a commodity economy.

Some scholars said that in our country, laws related to citizens' political rights and freedoms, such as the press law, publication law, association law, demonstration law, and appeal law, have been stipulated in the constitution but have not been enacted for decades. The reason for this delay is likely related to our habit of using mass movements to solve political and economic problems, rather than understanding or being skilled at using legal means to protect and stimulate the political enthusiasm of the people. In fact, using laws to protect citizens' constitutional rights and freedoms is the stimulant and nourishment that enhances the political enthusiasm and economic vitality of the people. It can greatly stimulate the people's sense of ownership and initiative in managing state and social affairs. More democratic rights mean more participation, which also means more responsibility.

The scholars present generally felt that many of our traditional legal concepts need to be updated. For example, we do not emphasize the need to constrain power. In fact, any power that is not constrained will lead to corruption. To build our country into a socialist law-governed state, we must update many traditional legal concepts and emphasize the supremacy of the law.

### 首都一些专家学者提出  立法不应滞后于改革  法律也是激励人民积极性的手段

　　首都一些专家学者提出
    立法不应滞后于改革
    法律也是激励人民积极性的手段
    本报北京２月２４日讯  记者王礼明报道：中国社会科学院法学研究所日前举行“中国法制改革学术讨论会”。首都５０多位专家学者各抒己见，就我国法制改革和建设法治国家问题，发表了许多意见。
    不少学者说，当前在建设和改革中所以会出现混乱，与立法跟不上改革的发展很有关系。立法对于改革来说，不应当“滞后”，而应当“超前”，要用法律来保障和指导改革。我们没有经验，一些法律一下子搞不出来，可以采取“拿来主义”。国外的、香港的法律中，一切适用于发展商品经济的东西，我们都可以借鉴，都可“拿来”用。
    有的学者说，在我们国家里，宪法上规定的与公民政治权利和自由有关的法律，如新闻法、出版法、社团法、游行示威法、申诉法等等，拖了几十年没有制定出来。这里面的原因，很可能与我们习惯于用群众运动来解决政治和经济问题、而不懂得或不善于用法制手段来保护和激励人民群众的政治积极性密切相关。其实，用法律来保护公民的宪法权利和自由，正是增强人民群众政治热情和经济活力的激素和养料，可以大大激发人民群众的主人翁意识和管理国家、社会事务的主动性。多一些民主权利，就意味着多一些参与，也意味着多一些责任。
    与会学者普遍感到，我们国家的许多传统的法律观念需要更新。比如，我们不大讲权力需要制约。其实，任何不受制约的权力，都会走向腐败。要把我们国家建设成为社会主义的法治国家，就必须更新许多传统的法律观念，就必须强调法律至上。
