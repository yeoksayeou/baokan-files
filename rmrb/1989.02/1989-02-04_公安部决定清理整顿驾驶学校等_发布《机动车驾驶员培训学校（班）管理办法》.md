The Ministry of Public Security has decided to clean up and rectify schools, centers, and training classes that train automobile drivers. It requires local public security organs to conduct a thorough review and inspection of these institutions. Those that do not meet the standards for operation, have poor teaching quality, or have many management issues will be ordered to cease operations.

According to the Ministry of Public Security, the current management of driver training is chaotic. Some driving schools prioritize economic benefits over teaching quality; some do not adhere to the prescribed learning duration for driving and arbitrarily reduce the learning time; and some do not even meet the basic requirements for operation. As a result, the drivers they train often lack the basic driving skills and safety awareness, leading to a higher incidence of traffic accidents among new drivers.

To address this problem, Wang Fang, the Minister of Public Security, issued an order on February 1 to promulgate the "Regulations on the Management of Motor Vehicle Driver Training Schools (Classes)" by the Ministry of Public Security.

　　公安部决定清理整顿驾驶学校等
　　发布《机动车驾驶员培训学校（班）管理办法》
    据新华社北京２月３日电  公安部长王芳２月１日发布命令，要求各地公安机关对培训汽车驾驶员的学校、中心、培训班等进行一次清理整顿，逐一审核。对不具备办学条件、教学质量差、管理问题多的培训单位，要责令停办。
    据公安部介绍，目前，由于驾驶员培训工作管理混乱，出现了有的驾驶学校只讲经济效益，不管教学质量；有的不遵守学习驾驶期限的规定，任意减少学习时间；还有的根本就不具备办学条件，培养出来的驾驶员驾驶技能与安全素质都达不到起码的要求，致使新驾驶员发生交通事故的问题较为突出。
    为了解决这一问题，王芳２月１日签署命令，发布了公安部关于《机动车驾驶员培训学校（班）管理办法》。
