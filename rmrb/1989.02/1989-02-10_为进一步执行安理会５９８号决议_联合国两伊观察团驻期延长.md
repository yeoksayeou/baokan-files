The United Nations Security Council today unanimously adopted a resolution to extend the mission of the United Nations Iran-Iraq Military Observer Group (UNIIMOG) until September 30.

This resolution was passed at a meeting convened by the Security Council based on a recommendation from UN Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar.

In his report, Pérez de Cuéllar stated that the continued presence of UNIIMOG is a necessary condition for further implementing Security Council Resolution 598.

Security Council Resolution 598 was adopted on July 20, 1987, calling for an immediate ceasefire between Iran and Iraq and for the resolution of the conflict through negotiations.

UNIIMOG was established on August 9, 1988, with 347 personnel from 26 countries deployed along the Iran-Iraq border to supervise the ceasefire and verify the withdrawal of forces to internationally recognized boundaries. Their initial mission was for a period of six months, expiring on February 2 of this year.

　　为进一步执行安理会５９８号决议
　  联合国两伊观察团驻期延长
    本报联合国２月８日电  记者刘开宸报道：联合国安理会今天一致通过一项决议，决定延长联合国驻伊朗和伊拉克军事观察团（两伊观察团）的使命到９月３０日止。
    此项决议是安理会根据联合国秘书长佩雷斯·德奎利亚尔的建议而开会通过的。
    德奎利亚尔在报告中说，两伊观察团的继续留驻是进一步执行安理会５９８号决议的必要条件。
    安理会５９８号决议是１９８７年７月２０日通过的，要求伊朗和伊拉克立即停火，通过谈判解决冲突。
    两伊观察团在１９８８年８月９日成立，共有来自２６国的３４７人，派驻两伊边境地区，监督停火，并核查两伊部队是否撤到国际公认边界。为期半年，到今年２月２日期满。
