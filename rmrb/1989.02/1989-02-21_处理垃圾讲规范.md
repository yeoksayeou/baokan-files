If you are a new resident of Tokyo or a foreigner unfamiliar with garbage disposal, you can obtain a set of guidelines: "The Correct Method of Disposing Garbage." The preface of the guidelines states:

"Everyone hopes for a clean and pleasant environment, but such an environment can only be established through the conscious efforts and cooperation of every resident. The correctness of each resident's garbage disposal methods directly affects the cleanliness and beauty of the streets. Please strictly follow the garbage disposal guidelines and help build a clean and beautiful street."

Although garbage disposal is a small matter, it affects every household. Tokyo residents strictly follow the basic guidelines for garbage disposal, which has become a conscious action. The reporter's residence in the Meguro-ku Sanchome district is a relatively quiet residential area. Every morning, housewives can be seen sweeping the front of their houses and carefully sorting and placing garbage into bags or bins at designated collection points. Around 10 AM, a blue cleaning truck arrives, and two sanitation workers quickly load the garbage into the rolling garbage truck, a process that takes only a few minutes.

Tokyo has 220,000 such garbage collection points, with an average of one point for every 17 households. Every day, 3,500 cleaning trucks traverse the streets and alleys, collecting garbage and transporting it to 13 incineration plants. The Tokyo Metropolitan Government requires household garbage to be sorted and disposed of at designated times: kitchen waste, paper scraps, and clothing are classified as burnable garbage and must be disposed of three times a week, after which they are incinerated; plastics, metals, glass, leather, ceramics, and other non-burnable items are disposed of once a week and sent to Tokyo Bay for landfill; large items such as furniture, appliances, and bicycles must be coordinated with the sanitation department and disposed of on specified dates. All garbage must be placed outside in the morning. Therefore, in a city of over 10 million people, it is rare to see garbage piled up haphazardly.

The reporter recently visited the sanitation department. In Tokyo, about 11,000 people are engaged in garbage collection and disposal, and the Tokyo Metropolitan Government's budget for garbage collection and disposal accounts for about 3-4% of the total budget. According to the department, about 12,000 tons of household garbage are collected daily, and about 100 tons of recycled waste are processed daily.

Sanitation Department Director Harada Hitoshi said that to effectively manage urban garbage, there are three key points: first, a systematic approach to recycling, incineration, and landfill; second, the availability of landfill sites; and third, the cooperation and understanding of residents. He introduced that in the 1950s, Tokyo experienced severe garbage problems due to the lack of a systematic approach to recycling and disposal, which led to garbage being piled up everywhere, obstructing traffic and polluting the environment. In the early 1960s, Tokyo took the opportunity of hosting the Olympics to propose the slogan "Building a Clean and Beautiful Tokyo," establishing garbage collection points and bins. In 1974, the city began implementing a sorting and collection system and increased the number of collection points. Vertical garbage chutes in buildings are prohibited, and large buildings must have designated collection points and apply for approval.

To gain the support of residents, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government emphasizes publicity and education. Garbage disposal knowledge is included in the fourth-grade textbooks, and there are pamphlets and comic books for housewives and children. The government also provides free films and videos on garbage disposal and organizes monthly garbage-related activities for citizens to visit processing facilities. To reduce the amount of garbage, more than 2,000 groups and 104,000 households in Tokyo participate in waste recycling activities. The garbage from Tokyo's urban areas is almost entirely used for land reclamation, and so far, 230 hectares of sea area have been filled in. On top of this, sanitation plants, senior citizen homes, tropical botanical gardens, and youth sports facilities have been built.

Tokyo's garbage disposal methods have been praised by European and American countries, but there are also problems, such as the lack of landfill sites. The current landfill sites in Tokyo Bay are only sufficient until 1995, and future solutions are yet to be determined. Additionally, building incineration plants in urban areas faces opposition from residents, and garbage trucks exacerbate traffic congestion. It is reported that the Ministry of Health is studying the feasibility of using vacuum pipelines to directly transport household garbage to incineration plants.

Director Harada expressed that in the field of urban garbage disposal, each country has its own national conditions, and the composition of garbage is also different. However, implementing standardized garbage disposal is a method worth referencing.

### 处理垃圾讲规范

　　处理垃圾讲规范
    本报记者  孙东民
    　　　　东京
    假如您是新迁入东京的居民，或者是不熟悉如何处理垃圾的外国人，您都可以得到一本守则：《扔垃圾的正确方法》，守则序言里有这样的话：
    “所有的人都希望有个清洁良好的环境，但这种环境只有通过每位居民的自觉与合作才能建立。各位居民扔垃圾的方法正确与否，直接关系到街道的清洁和美观。务请各位严守扔垃圾的守则，协助建立一个清洁又美丽的街道。”
    处理垃圾事情虽小，但关系到千家万户。东京居民严守扔垃圾的基本守则，早已成为自觉行动。记者住地所在的目黑区三田町，算是闹中取静的居民区。每天清晨都可看到家庭主妇们打扫门前路面，把仔细整理好的垃圾装进垃圾袋或垃圾筒，放到集放地点。１０时许，一辆蓝色的清洁车开到，两位清洁工人迅速把垃圾提放到滚卷式的清洁车内，总共不过分把钟。
    东京有２２万个这样的垃圾集放点，平均１７户设一处。每天有３５００辆清扫车在穿街走巷，收集垃圾，然后运到１３个焚化处理厂。东京都规定，家庭垃圾必须分类，定时扔出：厨房的生食垃圾、纸屑、衣类等属可燃垃圾，每周扔出３次，收集后焚烧处理；塑料、金属、玻璃、皮革、陶瓷器等属非燃垃圾，每周扔１次，筛选后送往东京湾填埋；而家具、家电、自行车等大型垃圾，须事先与清扫部门联系，在指定日期扔出、运走。所有垃圾必须在清晨扔放。因此，在１０００多万人口的东京很少看到乱堆垃圾的现象。
    记者日前曾去清扫局采访。在东京，约有１．１万名人员从事垃圾的收集和处理，东京都用于垃圾清扫和处理的预算约占总预算的３％—４％。据介绍，清扫局每天收集生活垃圾约１．２万吨，经过处理后的废物回收每天约１００吨。
    清扫局局长原达人先生说，要搞好城市垃圾的处理有三条，一是垃圾的回收、焚烧、填埋系统化，二是要有填埋用地，三是取得居民的合作与理解。他介绍说，东京都在５０年代因没有实行系统的回收、处理，也出现过垃圾到处堆放，严重妨碍交通、污染环境的情况。６０年代初，东京借举办奥运会之机提出了“建设清洁美丽的东京”的口号，设垃圾集放点和垃圾罐。１９７４年开始实行分类收集，增设集放点。楼房建筑已禁止设计竖穴式扔垃圾通道，大建筑必须单设集放点并提出申请，征得认可。
    为了取得居民的支持，东京都重视宣传教育，小学４年级课本中就有垃圾处理常识，还有面向家庭主妇和儿童的宣传手册和漫画读物，都政府备有关于垃圾处理的电影、录相供免费播放，并定期举行垃圾问题活动月，组织市民参观处理设施。为减少垃圾量，东京都有２０００多个团体、１０４万住户参加废物回收利用活动。东京都市区的垃圾几乎都用于埋海造地，迄今已填平２３０公顷的海面。上面建清扫工厂、老人之家，热带植物园、青少年运动设施。
    东京都的垃圾处理受到欧美国家的称赞，但也有头痛的问题，这就是缺少埋填的用地。东京湾内现有用地只够到１９９５年，今后怎么办尚待解决。此外在市区建焚烧厂遭到居民反对，垃圾车辆加剧了交通堵塞。据悉，厚生省正在研究用真空输送管道把家庭垃圾直接吸往焚烧工厂的可行性。
    清扫局局长原先生表示，在城市垃圾处理方面，各国有各国的国情，垃圾成分也不一样。但实行垃圾处理的规范化，是一种可资参考的方式。
