    △ The publication of the essay collection "AQ Really Became Prosperous – Selected Essays from Fenghua" has received attention and support from many enthusiastic readers. We express our gratitude to the thousands of readers who have pre-ordered the book by remittance or letter. After discussions with the People's Daily Publishing House, it has been decided that the essay collection will be published by May 1989. At that time, we will promptly send the book to pre-orderers. Those who have pre-ordered by letter can contact their local Xinhua Bookstore or send the payment to the Literature Department of the People's Daily, with each copy priced at 2.00 yuan, including 0.10 yuan for postage.

    △ In the article "Leaving So Suddenly – In Memory of Comrade Li Shuo" by Yu Haocheng, published on the eighth page of your newspaper on December 19, 1988, the fourth paragraph states, "At a recent symposium commemorating the 60th anniversary of the Hundred Days' Reform...", which should be "90th anniversary" (1898–1988). I respectfully point this out.

    △贵报1988年12月19日第八版于浩成文《离去何太匆——悼念黎澍同志》第四段中“在不久前召开的纪念戊戌变法60周年座谈会上，……”，“60周年”应为“90周年”（1898—1988），谨指出。
