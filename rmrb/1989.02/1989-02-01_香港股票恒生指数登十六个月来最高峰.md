Since the beginning of the year, the Hong Kong stock market has gradually become more active, with prices of various stocks rising across the board. Today morning, the Hang Seng Index, which marks the price level of the Hong Kong stock market, broke through the 3000-point mark, reaching a new high since the stock market storm of October 1987.

Over the past year, Hong Kong stock prices have seen relatively small fluctuations. The Hang Seng Index reached over 2700 points in July but failed to break through further, and stock trading volumes have been shrinking, with the lowest daily turnover sometimes dropping to just a few hundred million Hong Kong dollars. Since the beginning of this year, the Hong Kong stock market has started to break out of its stagnant phase. On January 9, the Hang Seng Index surpassed the highest record of last year and has been rising since.

Today, as the stock market opened, prices surged significantly. By the midday close, the Hang Seng Index reached 3040 points, up 83 points from the previous trading day. The total turnover for the day was nearly 3 billion Hong Kong dollars.

　　香港股票恒生指数登十六个月来最高峰
    据新华社香港１月３０日电  （记者陈晓彬）年初以来，香港股票市场渐趋活跃，各类股票价格全面上升。今天上午，标志香港股票市场价格水平的恒生指数突破３０００点，登上１９８７年１０月股票市场风暴以来的新高峰。
    在过去的一年中，香港股票价格起落不大，恒生指数在７月份达到２７００多点后再无新突破，股票交易的成交额也不断萎缩，最少时一天只有几亿港元。今年年初以来，香港股票市场开始打破沉闷局面，１月９日恒生指数超过了去年的最高记录，以后又有上升。
    今天，股票市场一开市，价格就出现大幅度上升局面，中午收市时，恒生指数达到３０４０点，比上个交易日上升８３点。全日总成交额近３０亿港元。
