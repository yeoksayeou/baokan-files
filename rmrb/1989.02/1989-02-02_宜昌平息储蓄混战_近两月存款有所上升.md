Yichang Calms the Savings War, Deposits Rise in Recent Months

Newspaper: Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, February 1st - (Correspondents Liu Zhaokui and Reporter Shi Yongfeng) Yichang City, Hubei Province, has taken serious steps to rectify the financial market, calming a previous savings war and gradually bringing financial management back to order.

Since last November, various specialized banks in Yichang City have been competing to raise interest rates and open savings branches. Some savings branches, in their prize-saving business, in addition to paying the stipulated interest, also give away bed sheets or quilts. Some savings branches exceed the stipulated interest rates, paying more interest, making the actual deposits received by the bank lower than the amount on the deposit certificates issued to depositors, creating false deposits. Some savings branches use term deposit certificates instead of bonds, with annual interest rates exceeding the base rate by 38.9%. Some banks, in order to compete for territory, have arbitrarily opened savings branches in areas with dense savings networks and extremely limited savings sources. All of these actions have disrupted financial order, caused a great waste of manpower, financial resources, and materials, expanded consumption fund expenditures, and played a role in pushing up prices.

To address this, the People's Bank of Yichang City took decisive measures, imposing economic penalties on 7 savings branches that violated financial policies, totaling 180,000 yuan in fines and freezing 537,000 yuan in deposits. The bank also reiterated the regulations: no arbitrary increase or disguised increase in savings deposit interest rates, no giving away of goods or souvenirs. At the same time, it revoked and suspended the operation of disorderly savings institutions. For 8 savings branches that did not have a "Financial Business Operation Permit," it required them to clean up and rectify before applying for a permit. It was also stipulated that in the future, new financial institutions must strictly follow the principle of "reporting before selecting a site, constructing after approval, and operating after obtaining a permit and license," otherwise, they will be dealt with as illegal. It is understood that after the "savings war" was calmed, Yichang City's savings deposits have risen in the past two months.

　　宜昌平息储蓄混战　近两月存款有所上升
    新华社武汉２月１日电  （通讯员刘兆奎、记者施勇峰）湖北省宜昌市认真整顿金融市场，平息了一度出现的储蓄混战，使金融管理逐步走向正规。
    去年１１月以来，宜昌市各家专业银行竞相抬高利率，竞相开办储蓄所。有的储蓄所在有奖储蓄业务中，除支付规定的利息外，还另赠被套或床单；有的储蓄所超过规定利率，多付利息，使银行实收存款余额低于存款户开出的存单金额，造成虚假存款；有的储蓄所以定期存单代替债券，年息竟超出基准利率的３８．９％；有的银行为了争地盘，在储蓄网点密集和储源极少的地方擅自开办储蓄所。如此等等，既扰乱了金融秩序，又造成了人、财、物力的极大浪费，扩大了消费基金支出，对物价上涨起了推波助澜作用。
    为此，宜昌市人民银行采取果断措施，对违反金融政策的７家储蓄所给予了经济处罚，共罚款１．８万元，冻结存款５３．７万元。并再次明确规定：不准擅自提高或变相提高储蓄存款利率，不准馈赠实物和发纪念品。同时，撤销、停办了乱设的储蓄机构。对未办《经营金融业务许可证》的８个储蓄所，要求他们清理整顿后，予以申报领证，并规定今后新设金融机构，各专业银行要严格遵循“选点之前要报告，审批之后再筹建，发证领照再营业”的原则，否则将作违法处理。据了解，“储蓄混战”平息后，宜昌市近两月储蓄存款有所上升。
