Soviet Foreign Minister Discusses Afghan Issues with Kabul Regime Ambassador

The United States Reiterates Continued Support for Afghan Resistance Forces

MOSCOW, Jan. 30 (Xinhua) — Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze today met with the Afghan regime's ambassador to the Soviet Union, Said Mohammad, to discuss joint actions to quickly resolve the Afghan issue.

Sources noted that Shevardnadze, at a time when the situation in Afghanistan is increasingly tense, Soviet troops are about to complete their withdrawal, and Soviet leaders are frequently visiting Kabul, met with the Afghan ambassador at his request.

According to Tass, during the meeting, Shevardnadze and Said exchanged detailed views on bilateral relations and cooperation in the next phase. Both sides reaffirmed their commitment to implementing the Geneva Accords and advocated for dialogue and mutual compromise with various political forces in Afghanistan to continue seeking a path to national reconciliation.

Both sides declared that the Afghan resistance forces' attempt to resolve internal issues through military means and to undermine the will of the Kabul regime through economic blockade is doomed to failure.

WASHINGTON, Jan. 30 (Xinhua) — The United States today reiterated its continued support for the Afghan resistance forces. U.S. officials also stated that the United States cannot prevent the Afghan resistance from attacking the Kabul regime.

White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters today that as long as the Soviet Union continues to support the current Kabul regime, the United States will continue its policy of supporting the Afghan resistance forces. Fitzwater said that after the Soviet troops completely withdraw from Afghanistan next month, the United States will play a role in promoting progress and stability in Afghanistan.

At a State Department press conference today, spokesman Charles Redman said the United States supports the Afghan resistance forces' various attempts to replace the illegal Kabul regime with a new political structure after the Soviet withdrawal.

Redman also accused the Soviet Union of continuing its indiscriminate bombing of Afghanistan and implementing a "scorched earth" policy. He urged close attention to this situation.

Richard Murphy, former Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and South Asian Affairs in the Reagan administration, said over the weekend that after the complete withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan, the United States cannot prevent the Afghan resistance forces' increasingly tightening attacks on the Kabul regime.

Murphy, who serves as a policy advisor in the State Department of the new Bush administration, said that despite the United States having spent tens of billions of dollars in Afghanistan, it still cannot prevent the mutual slaughter that will occur in Afghanistan.

　　苏外长同喀布尔政权大使讨论阿问题
    美国重申继续支持阿富汗抵抗力量
    新华社莫斯科１月３０日电  苏联外交部长谢瓦尔德纳泽今天同喀布尔政权驻苏大使赛义德·穆罕默德讨论了两国在尽快解决阿富汗问题方面采取联合行动的问题。
    此间人士注意到，谢瓦尔德纳泽是在阿富汗局势更加紧张、苏军即将撤离完毕、苏联领导人频频出访喀布尔之际，应喀布尔政权大使的请求会见他的。
    据塔斯社报道，会见时，谢瓦尔德纳泽同赛义德就两国关系和下一阶段的合作问题详细交换了意见。双方重申将履行日内瓦协议，主张通过同阿富汗各种政治力量进行对话和求得互相妥协，继续寻找民族和解的途径。
    双方宣称，阿富汗抵抗力量想用军事办法解决内部问题和靠经济封锁来瓦解喀布尔政权意志的做法是没有前途的。
    新华社华盛顿１月３０日电　美国今天重申将继续支持阿富汗抵抗力量。美国官员并且表示，美国不能阻止阿抵抗力量对喀布尔政权的进攻。
    白宫发言人马林·菲茨沃特今天对记者说，只要苏联仍然支持喀布尔现政权，美国将继续推行支持阿富汗抵抗力量的政策。菲茨沃特说，苏联军队下月全部撤出阿富汗之后，美国将对阿富汗的进步和稳定起促进作用。
    在国务院今天举行的新闻发布会上，新闻发言人查尔斯·雷德曼说，美国支持阿富汗抵抗力量在苏联撤军后以新的政治结构取代喀布尔非法政权的各种尝试。
    雷德曼还指责苏联继续对阿富汗进行狂轰滥炸，实行“焦土政策”。他呼吁密切注视这一事态。
    前里根政府负责远东和南亚事务的助理国务卿理查德·墨菲曾于上周末说，在苏联军队全部撤出阿富汗后，美国不能阻止阿富汗抵抗力量对喀布尔政权日益加紧的进攻。
    墨菲在布什新政府内担任国务院的一名政策顾问。他说，尽管美国已在阿富汗花了几十亿美元，但仍无力阻止将在阿富汗发生的相互残杀。
