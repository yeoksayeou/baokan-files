Title: Protecting China's Wild Scorpion Resources

Scorpions are a type of venomous wild animal and a valuable medicinal material. For a long time, due to excessive capture and pesticide pollution, China's scorpion resources have been severely damaged. Consequently, the price of scorpions has risen, and there has been a surge in the popularity of breeding scorpions. However, extensive investigations and experiments have shown that after a few generations of artificial breeding, the venom of scorpions degenerates.

How should we utilize and protect China's wild scorpion resources? I believe that we should take scientific measures based on the biological characteristics of scorpions. For example, the breeding season for scorpions is in July and August each year, but the normal time for capturing scorpions is from April to June. Therefore, during the breeding season and the hibernation period, it is necessary to strictly prohibit the capture of scorpions. Procurement units or individuals should protect pregnant scorpions and young scorpions and release them back into their original habitats through various channels. Large scorpions can be used to extract venom for medicinal processing.

I hope that the relevant departments in scorpion-producing areas will take reasonable measures to protect this precious existing resource in China.

### 保护我国的野生蝎资源

　　保护我国的野生蝎资源
    蝎子是一种有毒的野生动物，是名贵中药材。长期以来，由于大量捕捉，再加上农药污染，使我国蝎资源遭到破坏。随之而来的则是，蝎子价格上升，“养蝎热”兴起。然而，大量的调查和实验证明，人工饲养繁殖蝎，不出数代，蝎子的毒性就退化了。
    如何利用和保护我国的野生蝎资源呢？我认为，应针对蝎子的生物特性，采取科学的措施。例如，蝎子繁殖期在每年的７、８月间，而正常的捕蝎时间却在４至６月。因而，在蝎子繁殖季节和冬眠期，应严禁捕捉蝎子。收购单位或个人应将孕蝎和幼蝎保护好，通过各种渠道，将幼蝎放回到原来的生活环境中。大蝎子可用来提取毒素，加工制药。
    希望蝎产区的有关部门采取合理的措施，保护我国这一现存的宝贵资源。
