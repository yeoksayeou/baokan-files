Afghan Foreign Ministry Official Confirms
Soviet Troops to Withdraw Completely from Afghanistan on the 15th

Xinhua News Agency, Kabul, February 14 (Reporters Ma Guang and Ge Xiangwen) An Afghan Foreign Ministry official said last night that the last Soviet soldier will withdraw from Afghanistan on February 15.

Mohammed Amany, Director of the Afghan Foreign Ministry's News Center, in an interview with Xinhua News Agency reporters about some confusing statements regarding the Soviet withdrawal process, said that the report that the last batch of Soviet troops left Kabul on February 13 was a misunderstanding. That was merely "a gesture made to reporters eager to know about the Soviet withdrawal from Kabul," and was "confusing news released by a high-ranking official of the Soviet military command in Afghanistan."

He said that in reality, there are still Soviet troops in Kabul and northern Afghanistan, and they will withdraw completely from Afghanistan on February 15 in accordance with the Geneva Agreement.

He said that originally, it was planned that on February 13, Soviet transport planes delivering food to Kabul would take away 150 Soviet soldiers on their return to the Soviet Union. However, due to heavy snow, only two transport planes arrived in Kabul. The Soviet side, in order to make a gesture to more than 120 reporters, decided to have the planes take away 15 soldiers as a symbol of the last batch of Soviet troops withdrawing from Kabul.

He said that the last to leave Afghanistan will be the commander of the Soviet troops in Afghanistan, Gromov. Although he is still in northern Afghanistan, he will leave Kabul Airport by plane in the evening of February 15 and cross the northern border of Afghanistan before the deadline specified in the Geneva Agreement, which is midnight.

Amany added that due to an agreement between the Soviet side and the Kabul side not to publicize the numbers and progress of the Soviet withdrawal, the final stage of the Soviet withdrawal has not been made public. This situation has only been reported to the United Nations monitoring group in Afghanistan.

The Afghan official went on to say that there will be no ceremony when the Soviet troops withdraw completely, but the Afghan government will issue a statement on this matter. Soviet commander Gromov will also issue a news release before leaving the airport.

February 13, the last batch of Soviet combat troops boarded a plane at Kabul Airport, the capital of Afghanistan, and left for their homeland.

　　阿富汗外交部官员证实    
    苏军仍将于十五日全部撤出阿富汗
    新华社喀布尔２月１４日电  （记者马光、葛相文）阿富汗外交部官员昨天晚间说，最后一名苏联军人将于２月１５日撤出阿富汗。
    阿富汗外交部新闻中心主任穆罕默德·阿马尼就苏联撤军进程的一些混乱说法接受新华社记者采访时说，２月１３日最后一批苏联军队撤离喀布尔的报道是一种误解，那只是“向急切想了解苏联人从喀布尔撤出的记者作出的一个表示”，是驻阿苏军司令部高级官员发出的“混乱新闻”。
    他说，实际上，在喀布尔和阿富汗北部地区仍留有苏联军队，他们将按照日内瓦协议于２月１５日全部撤出阿富汗。
    他说，原计划，２月１３日向喀布尔运送食品的苏联运输飞机在返回苏联时带走１５０名苏联军人，但由于天降大雪，只有两架运输机到达喀布尔。苏联方面为向１２０多名记者作出表示，决定由飞机带走１５名军人，作为最后一批苏军撤离喀布尔的象征。
    他说，最后离开阿富汗的将是驻阿苏军司令格罗莫夫。虽然他现在仍在阿富汗北部。他将于２月１５日晚间乘飞机离开喀布尔机场并于日内瓦协议规定的最后期限——午夜１２时之前越过阿富汗北部边界。
    阿马尼又说，由于苏联方面同喀布尔方面同意双方都不公布苏联撤军的数字和进程，苏联撤军的最后阶段尚未公开。这一情况只通报给驻阿联合国监督小组。
    这位阿富汗官员接着说，苏联全部撤军时将不搞任何仪式，但阿富汗政府将就此发表一项声明。苏军司令格罗莫夫也将在离开机场前发表一项新闻公报。
