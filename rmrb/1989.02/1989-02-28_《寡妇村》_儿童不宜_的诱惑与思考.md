The film "The Widow Village," directed by Wang Jin, deputy general manager of the Zhujiang Film Studio, has recently been screened across the country. The film was completed a year ago, and by January of this year, 150 copies had already been sold. The theaters were bustling with audiences.

The film industry generally considers "The Widow Village" to be a good film, but its fame is largely due to the phrase "Not Suitable for Children." The reporter observed at several theaters in Beijing that the advertisements all prominently displayed phrases such as "This film is not suitable for children to watch" and "This film does not have student tickets." The Beijing Children's Theater had a notice stating: "According to the municipal government's notice, this film is strictly prohibited for minors to watch."

According to the reporter's understanding, China's film censorship authority, the Film Bureau of the Ministry of Radio, Film, and Television, has never made any restrictive suggestions regarding the distribution and screening of this film. The Beijing Municipal Government has also not issued such an order in the name of the municipal government (the Children's Theater said they received a phone call from the Film and Television Section of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture). So, how did the phrase "Not Suitable for Children" come about and cause a stir among the audience?

Wang Jin said that this film, which reflects the unique marriage customs of the Hui'an women in Fujian before and after liberation through the stories of three couples over two nights, was jointly produced by Zhujiang Film Studio and Hong Kong's Silver City. Therefore, the film had to consider the Hong Kong market. Too much nudity would not be allowed in mainland China. Thus, Wang Jin took a middle road: it seems to be exposed but is not actually exposed. It is visually not exposed, but through lighting and sound effects, it gives the audience the feeling of exposure. Wang Jin considers this a folk custom film. In an interview with the author last October, he insisted: "This type of content is indeed not suitable for minors, because they cannot understand it."

Perhaps this is the original source of "Not Suitable for Children." Hong Kong newspapers first reported this, and the saying that "The Widow Village" is not suitable for children spread like a wind from south to north across China. This was a "wind-making" action jointly promoted by the news media and enthusiastically accepted by the distribution department.

These four words brought economic benefits that Wang Jin had not fully anticipated. Li Jianguo, the box office manager of the Beijing Children's Theater, said: "People from all walks of life come to book group tickets, and just recently when 'Othello' was screened, the audience was mainly from the intellectual community." The Beijing Xuanwu Theater is a converted air-raid shelter. According to the theater, on January 27 and 28, all 12 screenings of "The Widow Village" were sold out, with eight screenings booked by groups. Gao Guirong, the deputy manager with eight years of theater experience, said: "This is the only time I have encountered this in recent years."

After the film screening, the reporter interviewed several audience members at the theater entrance. A third-year student from Tsinghua University said: "Actually, there's nothing much, no sensory stimulation, children can watch it, but they might not understand it." A private entrepreneur raised his voice and said: "What's this? I thought it would be 'yellow,' but there's nothing!" As the reporter was about to interview a young woman, she quickly blushed and interrupted: "What's the matter? I don't usually watch movies, I can't say. I still have to pick up my child from kindergarten!"

When the reporter interviewed one of the female leads, He Jialing, the actress in her forties said emotionally: "The marriages of Hui'an women are very unfortunate, and even more unfortunate is that Hui'an women do not realize this. I hope the film can make the audience sympathize with Hui'an women." In this sense, "The Widow Village" is successful, which is thanks to the serious and arduous artistic creation of the scriptwriter, director, and actors. However, "Not Suitable for Children" made many people wonder after watching the film: "Is this what 'Not Suitable for Children' means?"

The "Film Review Regulations" currently being drafted specifically list four types of films that are restricted for minors (under 16 years old). The first type includes films with scenes of rape, theft, drug use, drug trafficking, prostitution, etc.; the second type includes films with violent, murderous, and fighting scenes that can easily frighten minors; the third type includes films that depict sexual love scenes; the fourth type includes films that depict social abnormalities. The formal implementation of this regulation will face considerable difficulties, mainly in how to draw the line.

### 《寡妇村》——“儿童不宜”的诱惑与思考

　　《寡妇村》——
    “儿童不宜”的诱惑与思考
    本报记者  李力
    由珠江电影制片公司副总经理王进导演的《寡妇村》近来在全国各地公演。影片一年前摄制完成，截至今年一月，已卖出了一百五十个拷贝。公演时影院门庭若市。
    电影界倾向于认为《寡妇村》是一部不错的影片，但它名声大噪，却是由于“儿童不宜”四个字。记者在北京的一些影院门口观察，影院广告牌上概无例外地标上“本片儿童不宜观看”、“本片没有学生票”等字样；北京儿童影院的告示牌上写着：“接市政府通知，本片严禁少年儿童观看”。
    据记者了解，中国的电影审查机关——广播电影电视部电影局从未对此片的发行与放映作出任何限制性建议，北京市也并未以市政府的名义发过这样的指令（儿童影院称他们是根据北京市文化局影视处的电话通知）。那么，“儿童不宜”是如何不约而同地“面世”，并引起不大不小的“观众潮”的呢？
    王进说，这部通过三对夫妻两个晚上的故事反映解放前后福建地区惠安女奇特婚俗的影片，是由珠影和香港银都机构联合拍摄的，所以影片要考虑在香港的市场。裸露太多，内地又不能发行。于是王进走了中间道路：似露非露，即直观看并不露，但又通过光效和声效使观众感到是露的。王进认为这是一部风俗片。他在去年十月接受笔者采访时坚持认为：“这类内容的影片确实不宜于少年儿童观看，因为他们无法理解。”
    大概这就是“儿童不宜”的原始出处。香港报纸率先登出此说，《寡妇村》儿童不宜之说也就如一股风由南到北刮遍中国。这是一次新闻界推波助澜、发行部门欣然接受的“造风”行动。
    这四个字收到了王进事先也没能充分预料到的经济效益。北京儿童影院票房负责人李建国说：“各个阶层的人都来订团体票，而前不久放映《奥赛罗》时观众主要是知识界。”北京宣武影院是用防空工事改建而成的。据影院介绍，那里一月二十七、二十八日放映十二场《寡妇村》场内竟无一虚席，其中有八场被团体包下。有着八年影院工作经历的副经理高桂荣说：“这是我近年来遇到的仅有的一次。”
    电影散场时，记者在影院门口采访了几位观众。一位清华大学三年级的学生说：“其实也没有什么，并没有感官刺激，小孩也能看，不过可能他们看不懂。”一位个体户提高嗓门说：“这算什么呀？哥们儿以为多‘黄’呢，咳！啥也没有！”记者正欲采访一位少妇，她连忙红着脸抢白：“干嘛呀，平时我又不怎么看电影，我说不好。我还得上幼儿园接孩子呢！”
    记者采访本片女主角之一郝嘉陵时，这位年近四十的女演员动情地说：“惠安女的婚姻非常不幸，更不幸的是惠安女认识不到这一点。我希望影片能使观众同情惠安女。”从这个意义上说，《寡妇村》是成功的，这归功于编剧、导演、演员严肃和艰苦的艺术创造。但是，“儿童不宜”却使不少人看罢电影后犯嘀咕：“这就是儿童不宜？”
    正在拟定的《电影审查条例》中专列了“限制少年儿童（指十六周岁以下）观看”的四类影片。一是有强奸、盗窃、吸毒、贩毒、卖淫等情节的；二是容易引起少年儿童恐怖的暴力、凶杀、打斗情节；三是表现性爱情节的；四是表现社会畸形现象的。这个条例的正式施行，将遇到不小的难度，就是如何划界线。
