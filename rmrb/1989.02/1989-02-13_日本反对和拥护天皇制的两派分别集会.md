In Japan's National Foundation Day today, factions opposing and supporting the emperor system held separate rallies to promote their respective views.

The Japan Socialist Party and the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan-affiliated Association for the Protection of the Constitution held a rally in Tokyo. Former Chairman of the Socialist Party Ishibashi Seiji gave a speech stating that Japan's military spending is continuously increasing, and activities to deify the emperor are developing. To prevent the resurgence of militarism, we must fight. The Kigen-setsu (National Foundation Day) Problem Liaison Conference held a rally of 1,000 people in Tokyo, opposing the glorification of the emperor. Twenty-three civic groups in Kyoto also held a parade and rally in their city to oppose the glorification of the emperor.

At the same time, the Association for the Celebration of Japan's Founding held a rally at the Meiji Shrine, with the association's president Mayumi Tsumura declaring that they would not allow the war responsibility to be shifted onto the emperor.
