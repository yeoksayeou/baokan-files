Polish citizens and foreign citizens within Poland will "be allowed to own foreign currency" and "freely exchange it" at official or negotiated rates.

This is a new provision in the foreign exchange law passed by the Polish Parliament on the 15th. With the implementation of the new law, Poland will gradually open its foreign exchange market and implement a dual exchange rate system.

According to this law, Polish economic entities must sell a portion of their foreign exchange earnings to the foreign exchange bank at the official rate, but they can purchase the foreign exchange they need at market rates in the foreign exchange market.

　　波兰议会通过一项新规定    
    允许公民拥有并自由兑换外币
    新华社华沙２月１６日电  波兰公民和波兰境内的外国公民将“可以拥有外币”并按照官价或议价“自由地进行交换”。
    这是波兰议会１５日通过的外汇法中的一项新规定。随着新法令的实施，波兰将逐步开放外汇市场，实行外币汇率双轨制。
    按照这部法律，波兰经济单位必须把外汇收入的一部分按官价卖给外汇银行，但它们可以随行就市地在外汇市场上购买所需的外汇。
