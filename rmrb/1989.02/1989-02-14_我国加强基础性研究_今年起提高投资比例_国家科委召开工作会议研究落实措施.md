From this year onwards, China will increase the investment proportion in basic research (including basic research and applied basic research). This is a policy measure for China to further strengthen basic research.

Vice Premier and Minister of the State Science and Technology Commission Song Jian reiterated the long-term, fundamental policy of ensuring the sustained and stable development of basic research. He said that the increase in the investment proportion for basic research will be carried out in two steps. By the end of the Seventh Five-Year Plan, the proportion of basic research in the annual national fiscal science and technology appropriations will be increased from the current 7.1% to 8%-9%. By the 1990s, it will be further increased to over 10%.

Basic research, as one of the three levels of China's scientific and technological work, has been slightly delayed in its deployment compared to the other two levels. Although this work has undergone some twists and turns, from an overall perspective, especially in the past 10 years, through the reform of the operating mechanism and management system, it has continued to develop. By the end of 1987, there were more than 1,500 research institutes (departments) mainly engaged in basic research established by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, universities, and local authorities. Several dozen national key laboratories with equipment equivalent to the international mid-to-high level were established. The number of scientific and technological personnel engaged in basic research nationwide reached 100,000. There were more than 20,000 basic research projects. In some major fields, a relatively complete discipline system has been formed. A number of emerging disciplines have developed rapidly. The academic level has been significantly improved, with some reaching and approaching the world's advanced level. A number of scientists have been awarded by international scientific institutions and academic organizations. 364 outstanding scientists hold various positions in international academic organizations. A large number of basic research achievements have been applied to production and have been transformed into productive forces.

However, the progress of basic research is still insufficient to change its weak status, and many scientists at home and abroad have expressed concern about this. This concern mainly lies in the fact that scientists believe that China's investment proportion in basic research is lower than that of general countries, the growth rate cannot keep up with the rate of price increases, the operation, maintenance, and open funds for national key laboratories are not implemented, and there is a lack of young talents engaged in basic research. Some contemporary active research fields lack follow-up forces, and the development of disciplines lacks overall planning, with some aspects showing a disproportionate phenomenon.

In order to continue to strengthen support for basic research, the State Council approved the State Science and Technology Commission to hold a national conference on basic research and applied basic research today, to study and implement the necessary and possible measures for this policy. Song Jian mentioned the following measures in his speech:

In the next few years, research work will be prioritized and deployed with major issues related to the national economy, people's livelihood, and the future of the nation, such as agriculture, energy, resources, environment, and population, to form several relatively stable basic research directions.

Increase the investment proportion and intensity of basic research. From a long-term perspective, it is necessary to gradually realize the diversification of investment sources. Encourage large and medium-sized enterprises, especially enterprise groups, to establish basic research funds, strengthen and develop the science fund system, and continue to implement various channels such as business appropriations and special appropriations.

Enhance the sense of competition and create a good environment for climbing international scientific peaks. Basic research achievements should be measured against international scientific frontiers. Encourage the full play of individual scientific thinking abilities, engage in creative work, and freely exchange academic ideas; exploratory research is not constrained by market demand and economic goals; support and protect pioneering scientific research that is not yet understood by people.

Promote talent flow and focus on cultivating a new generation of academic leaders. The basic research team should be dynamically mobile. On the one hand, continuously absorb outstanding young and middle-aged talents and those with practical experience, and on the other hand, encourage and promote some personnel to turn to applied, development, or interdisciplinary and marginal disciplines.

Encourage and support researchers to actively participate in international cooperation and academic exchanges and publish papers. For the large-scale scientific facilities that China has already mastered, efforts should also be made to open them to the outside world.

　　我国加强基础性研究    
    今年起提高投资比例    
    国家科委召开工作会议研究落实措施
    本报北京２月１３日讯  记者陈祖甲报道：从今年起，我国将增加基础性研究（包括基础研究和应用基础研究）的投资比例。这是我国进一步加强基础性研究的一个政策措施。
    国务委员、国家科委主任宋健今天在重申保证基础性研究持续稳定发展这一长期、基本方针的时候说，提高基础性研究投资比例将分两步走，“七五”计划末期由目前占当年全国财政科技拨款的７．１％提高到８％—９％，到９０年代，再提高到１０％以上。
    基础性研究工作作为我国科技工作的三个层次之一，在工作部署上，稍后于其它两个层次。这项工作虽然经过一些曲折，但从全局看，尤其是近１０年来，通过改革运行机制和管理制度，仍然不断有所发展。到１９８７年底，中国科学院、高等院校和地方建立的主要从事基础性研究工作的研究所（室）在１５００个以上；建立设备相当国际中等以上水平的国家重点实验室几十个；全国投入基础性研究工作的科技人员达到１０万；基础性研究课题达到２万多项。在一些主要领域，形成了门类比较齐全的学科体系。一大批新兴学科发展较快。学术水平有显著的提高，有些已达到和接近世界先进水平。有一批科学家得到国际科学机构和学术团体的奖励。３６４位优秀科学家在国际学术组织中担任各种职务。一大批基础性研究成果应用于生产，已经转化为生产力。
    然而，基础性研究的进展尚不足以改变其薄弱的状态，国内外的许多科学家对此表示担忧。这种忧思主要在于，科学家们认为我国基础性研究的投资比例比一般国家偏低，增长幅度赶不上物价上升幅度，国家重点实验室的运行费、维护费和开放经费的渠道不落实；从事基础性研究的年轻人才不足，一些当代活跃的研究领域缺乏后续力量，学科发展缺乏总体部署，有些方面出现比例失调现象。
    为了继续加强对基础性研究的支持，国务院批准国家科委在今天召开了全国基础研究和应用基础研究工作会议，研究和落实这项方针所必须和可能采取的措施。宋健在讲话中谈到了如下措施：
    在今后若干年内，以农业、能源、资源、环境、人口等关系到国计民生和民族前途的重大问题为目标，优先部署研究工作，形成若干比较稳定的基础性研究方向。
    增加基础性研究投资比例和强度。从长远考虑，要逐步实现投资来源多样化。鼓励大中型企业，特别是企业集团设立基础性研究基金，加强和发展科学基金制，同时继续实行事业费拨款和专项拨款等多种渠道。
    增强竞争意识，创造攀登国际科学高峰的良好环境。对于基础性研究成果，要放到国际科学前沿水平上衡量。鼓励发挥个人科学思维能力，从事创造性劳动，充分自由地交流学术思想；探索性研究不受市场需求和经济目标的约束；支持和保护暂时不被人们理解的开创性科学研究。
    促进人才流动，抓紧培养新一代学术带头人。要使基础性研究队伍做到动态流动。一方面不断吸收优秀中青年和有实践经验的人才，另一方面鼓励和推动部分人员转向应用、开发或交叉、边缘学科。
    鼓励和支持研究人员积极参加国际合作和学术交流、发表论文。对我国已掌握的建造大型科学装置的技术，也要争取对国外开放。
