	Finland recorded a trade surplus in 1988, but its international balance of payments continued to deteriorate.

	Last year, Finland's total exports of goods and services amounted to 90.9 billion Finnish marks, while imports totaled 88.2 billion Finnish marks, resulting in a trade surplus of 2.7 billion Finnish marks, an increase of 1.8 billion Finnish marks compared to 1987.

	In the export sector, Finland's two main economic pillars, forestry and metal industries, performed well, with export values increasing by 10% and 6% respectively. Chemical product exports also saw a slight increase. However, exports of textiles, apparel, leather, food, and agricultural products all experienced varying degrees of decline.

	Last year, Finland's imports showed significant structural changes. The import of consumer goods and investment goods increased by 10% and 12% respectively compared to 1987. Meanwhile, the import of crude oil and other fuels saw a significant decrease due to price drops.

	Despite Finland's trade surplus in 1988, the international balance of payments deficit continued to widen due to the repayment of foreign debt interest and the growth of domestic consumption.

	According to statistics, the international balance of payments deficit in 1988 was 12.6 billion Finnish marks, an increase of 4.1 billion Finnish marks compared to 1987.

	At the beginning of this year, the Finnish government decided to implement austerity measures to control public sector spending and the growth of private consumption, aiming to improve the international balance of payments and prevent economic overheating.

    芬兰决定实行经济紧缩政策
    新华社赫尔辛基电  １９８８年，芬兰对外贸易出现顺差，但是国际收支状况继续恶化。
    去年芬兰商品和劳务出口总额为９０９亿芬兰马克，进口总额为８８２亿芬兰马克，外贸顺差２７亿芬兰马克，比１９８７年增加１８亿芬兰马克。
    在出口中，作为芬兰经济两大支柱的森林加工和金属工业情况良好，出口额分别增长１０％和６％。化工产品的出口也略有增加。然而，纺织、服装、皮革、食品和农产品的出口均出现不同幅度的下降。
    去年，芬兰进口出现明显的结构性变化。消费品和投资性商品的进口分别比１９８７年增长１０％和１２％。与此同时，原油和其它燃料的进口由于价格暴跌出现大幅度下降。
    尽管芬兰去年出现外贸顺差，但由于偿付外债利息和国内消费增长，国际收支逆差继续增加。
    据统计，１９８８年国际收支逆差为１２６亿芬兰马克，比１９８７年增加４１亿芬兰马克。
    今年初，芬兰政府决定实行紧缩经济政策，控制公共部门的开支和私人消费的增长，以改善国际收支状况和阻止经济过热发展。
