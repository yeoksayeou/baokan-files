Qingdao Rubber Factory No. 9 has designed and produced 105 new products in the past two years, which is equivalent to twice the amount produced in the 30 years before the reform. Their products are sold in more than 50 countries and regions, and they earned over $4 million in foreign exchange from exports alone last year.

To encourage the development and rapid introduction of new products, the factory has held an annual rubber shoe design competition since 1986, inviting both professional and amateur designers to participate. From the contestants, 16 full-time designers have been selected. They have also implemented a reward and punishment system for designers, where those whose products are not ordered for a continuous year will be dismissed. After being hired as a full-time designer, seamstress Sha Shufen designed 8 new products in less than two years, 6 of which were put into production, with a total sales volume of over 1 million pairs, and she received an award.

In the development of new products, Qingdao Rubber Factory No. 9 has reformed the product sales mechanism by establishing a sales company. They have set up over 600 supply and sales points in more than 50 cities and 110 regions across the country. They pay close attention to market information as a crucial basis for developing new products. Once, a large American company came to the factory to discuss business, hoping to obtain samples of new products within three days. The designers and workers completed the task in just two days, presenting a qualified sample. The American client was impressed and signed a contract on the spot.

Qingdao Rubber Factory No. 9 places a high emphasis on technological progress, which drives the development of new products. In recent years, they have introduced a batch of advanced equipment and technology from the 1980s, significantly adjusting the factory's process layout and bidding farewell to old processes, old equipment, and old products. They have boldly digested and absorbed the imported equipment and technology, using domestically produced raw materials for production, achieving success. This alone saves the country over $1 million in foreign exchange annually. Currently, the factory has 12 product varieties that have received national, ministerial, and provincial-level quality product titles.

　　重视科技进步　引进消化吸收    
    青岛橡胶九厂开发新产品多创汇
    本报讯  青岛橡胶九厂近两年来设计投产新产品１０５种，相当于改革前３０年的两倍，产品销往５０多个国家和地区，仅去年就出口创汇４００多万美元。
    为了鼓励多出和快出新产品，自１９８６年以来，这个厂每年举办一次专业和业余设计人员共同参加的胶鞋设计大赛，从参赛人员中选聘专职设计人员１６名。他们还制定了设计人员奖罚办法，对连续一年产品未被订货的设计人员予以解聘。缝纫工沙淑芬被聘为专职设计人员后，不到两年就设计新品种８个，投产６个，总销售量达１００多万双，受到奖励。
    青岛橡胶九厂在新产品开发中，改革了产品销售机制，成立了销售公司，在全国５０多个城市、１１０多个地区设立了６００多个供应点和销售点。他们注意把市场信息作为新产品开发的重要依据。一次，美国一家大公司慕名来厂洽谈业务，希望三天内搞出新产品的样品，设计人员和工人只用了两天就拿出了合格样品。美国客商连连称赞，当场签订了合同。
    青岛橡胶九厂重视技术进步，促进新产品开发。近年来，他们先后引进了一批具有８０年代先进水平的设备和技术，对全厂工艺布局进行了大调整，向老工艺、老设备、老产品告别。他们对引进的设备和工艺，大胆进行消化吸收，使之全部采用国产原料生产，获得了成功，仅此一项每年可为国家节约外汇１００多万美元。目前，这个厂有１２个品种获得国家、部、省等各级优质产品称号。
