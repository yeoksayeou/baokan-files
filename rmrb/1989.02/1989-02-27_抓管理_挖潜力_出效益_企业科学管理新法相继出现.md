Grasp Management, Tap Potential, Achieve Results

New Scientific Management Methods for Enterprises Emerge

People's Daily, Beijing, February 26th — General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, Zhao Ziyang, recently emphasized that strengthening scientific management within enterprises is extremely important, with great potential, and should focus on gradually promoting some advanced experiences from enterprises. He also noted in a document that it seems that by focusing on management, on the basis of continuously improving the contract responsibility system, enterprises can improve efficiency through management, thereby alleviating financial difficulties, enhancing the capacity for reform, and there is much to be done.

This was revealed by Yuan Baohua at the symposium on optimizing enterprise internal management methods held by the China Enterprise Management Association yesterday.

Since the reforms and opening up, some enterprises in Beijing, Shanghai, Liaoning, Hebei, Shandong, Sichuan, Henan, Hubei, and Shaanxi have created scientific management methods to improve enterprise efficiency. In addition to the well-known "Full Load Work Method" created by Zhang Xinglai, Anshan Iron and Steel Corporation has developed the "Three Standards and Three Effects Management Method." There is also the "One Flow Production Method" of the Second Automobile Axle Factory, the "Effective System Management Method" of the Beijing Railway Bureau, the "Standardized Work Method" of Shandong Boshan Cement Plant, the "Responsibility Price Control Method" of Shaanxi Internal Combustion Engine Parts Factory, the "Fixed Position Management" of Acheng Relay Factory, the "Red Light System Management Method" of Chengdu Hongguang Electronic Tube Factory, the "Full Control Management Method" of Dalian Cathode Ray Tube Factory, the "Enterprise Efficiency Guarantee Method" of Henan Anyang Gear Factory, and the "Work Study Model Method" of Shanghai Jinshiling Radio Factory.
