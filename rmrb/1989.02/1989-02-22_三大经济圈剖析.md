Since the mid-1980s, with the development of global economic integration and regionalization, three major economic zones—Western Europe, North America, and East Asia—have gradually taken shape. These three economic zones are filled with competition, but their interdependence and cooperative relationships have also become more intimate.

	The Three Zones Gradually Form: Each with Its Own Characteristics

	European Common Market: The economic zone with the most participating countries and the highest level of cooperation among the "three major economic zones." Thirty years ago, when the Treaty of Rome came into effect, Western European countries began to embark on the path of economic integration. The construction of a "unified large market" started in 1985. Currently, the European Community (Spain and Portugal are still in the transitional stage) has established a customs union, implemented a common agricultural policy, established the European Monetary System, and is moving towards the creation of a "unified large market" where goods, capital, people, and services can flow freely. The European Community is accelerating regional economic cooperation mainly to enhance economic vitality and improve its disadvantageous position in international competition. Since the 1980s, Western Europe's industrial investment has stagnated, unemployment rates have remained high, economic growth has significantly slowed, and its technological leadership position has gradually been lost. If the European "unified large market" plan is realized by 1992, it will enhance the region's comprehensive economic strength and improve the European Community's competitive position against the United States and Japan. However, the realization of the "unified large market" by the European Community will not be smooth sailing. First, the European Community is essentially a union of sovereign nations, and balancing national sovereignty and the greatest degree of unity and cooperation is not easy. Second, there are still differences in interests among the European Community countries regarding agricultural subsidies, uniform value-added tax and indirect tax rates, and monetary and financial integration. Third, it will take time to narrow the economic gap between the south and north within the European Community. However, Western Europe has reached an "irreversible" stage in building a "unified large market." Therefore, even if some of the plan's goals are not fully achieved by 1992, a basic framework of a higher-level "economic zone" can be established.

	North American "Economic Zone": A bilateral "free trade area" centered around the United States. In 1980, Reagan proposed the idea of a "North American Common Market" including Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean countries during his presidential campaign. By the mid-1980s, as the United States' advantage in international trade no longer existed, the trend of global economic regionalization strengthened, and the regulatory function of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade declined, the United States increasingly felt the need to strengthen economic cooperation with neighboring countries and regions, especially Canada, to maintain its international economic position. In June 1986, the United States began negotiations with Canada to sign a "free trade agreement," which took a year and a half. Finally, on January 2, 1988, Reagan and Mulroney signed the "U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement." The agreement came into effect on January 1, 1989. According to the agreement, tariffs on goods between the two countries will be gradually reduced to zero in three phases by 1989, 1993, and 1998, making bilateral trade in goods tax-free. The limit on U.S. capital directly and indirectly purchasing Canadian companies will be raised, and the two countries will gradually provide national treatment to each other's citizens in labor cooperation. The United States and Mexico signed a "framework agreement" in November 1987 and began negotiations on the details of trade liberalization between the two countries. However, due to the significant gap in economic development levels between the two countries, reaching an agreement will take some time. From this, it can be seen that Reagan's idea of establishing a "North American Common Market" proposed eight years ago is gradually being realized.

	East Asian "Economic Zone": Informal economic ties and cooperation led by Japan. In recent years, there has been much discussion about constructing an economic zone in the Asia-Pacific region, but so far, there have been no government agreements or specific actions to formally establish it. However, from the economic relations in East Asia, an economic cooperation "zone" with a good economic circulation mechanism and led by Japan is gradually forming. This is manifested in the continuous strengthening of regional economic integration, especially since 1985, the degree of dependence of countries in the zone on the U.S. market has decreased, while mutual dependence has increased; Japan's direct investment in the zone has increased, and a new pattern of mutual investment has emerged; vertical division of labor within the zone has weakened, while horizontal division of labor has strengthened; the status and role of the yen within the zone have risen, while the dollar has relatively declined. Some Japanese scholars have proposed the idea of an "East Asian Economic Zone" including Japan, the "Four Asian Tigers," ASEAN, and China (some propose excluding China), and some advocate forming some form of economic cooperation to counterbalance Western Europe and North America. However, from the current situation, the possibility of forming a contractual economic cooperation organization similar to Western Europe and North America in the Asia-Pacific region this century is extremely small.

	Economic Strengths Are Comparable: Competition and Cooperation Coexist

	The Western Europe, North America, and East Asia "three major economic zones" are the most economically and technologically advanced regions in the world. Their combined gross national product and total foreign trade volume account for about three-quarters of the world's total. They are the world's three major industrial processing bases and the locations of the three major international financial centers, forming the world's tripartite economic structure.

	From the scale of the economy, the three economic zones have significant differences but each has its own advantages. The European Community has the largest trade volume and is in balance. North America has the largest production scale and is the main source of modern technology. The United States still plays a leading role in the world economy, but its huge trade deficit indicates that it is in a difficult position in international competition. The East Asian economic zone, despite having the smallest production scale, has a trade volume comparable to North America and a huge trade surplus, demonstrating strong international competitiveness. The East Asian region, including China, has a population of over 30% of the world's total, with enormous market potential. Economists generally believe that the East Asian economic zone will be the most dynamic region in the world economy, and its economic strength and influence on the world economy will continue to increase.

	The "three major economic zones" are filled with competition and struggle, with trade wars, exchange rate wars, and interest rate wars continuing. On the other hand, their interdependence and mutual interests have never been as close as they are now, to the extent that the development of the other side has become an indispensable external condition for their own development. Taking import and export trade as an example, between 1970 and 1987, the trade volume between Japan and the European Community increased by 14.5 times, between East Asia and North America by 12.5 times, between the Asian "Four Tigers" and North America by 48 times, and between North America and the European Community by 6.1 times. As for the rapid development of mutual investment, personnel, and technological exchanges between Japan, the United States, and Europe, it has attracted much attention.

	Due to the different backgrounds of the formation of the "three major economic zones" and the varying internal situations, the degree of internal and external dependence varies. The economic gap between the European Community countries is relatively small, and horizontal division of labor is developed, so their internal "self-sufficiency" ability is relatively strong. Their degree of external dependence is relatively light, while North America and East Asia have significant differences in economic scale and level, and their degree of external dependence is relatively high. Taking the export commodity market as an example, in 1987, 58% of the export commodities of the European Community countries were consumed within the region, while North America and East Asia had only 38.9% and 43.6%, respectively.

	Promoting Economic Development: Far-Reaching Impact in the Future

	The formation of the "three major economic zones" will enhance the economic vitality within the "zones" and promote the development and relative stability of the world economy. In the process of gradually weakening or eliminating various obstacles to the free flow of production factors within each "zone," resources can be more effectively allocated and scale economies can be realized. Competition and mergers and acquisitions among enterprises within member countries will intensify, fixed capital investment in various countries will increase, and the pace of industrial structure adjustment will accelerate; the survival of the fittest will make the production system more rational, production efficiency will be improved, and costs and prices will be reduced. In addition, the contradictions and differences that exist between member countries will be better resolved and adjusted. The economies of the countries within the region will develop faster due to these new factors. According to a research report published by the European Community Executive Commission on May 9, 1988, after the unified market is established in 1992, the European Community's gross national product can increase by 4.5% to 5%, industrial production costs can be reduced by 7%, corporate profits can increase by 1.8%, and prices can be reduced by an average of 6%, creating 2 million job opportunities. West Germany's Kohl said that the European Community may experience an "economic revival." It is estimated that by 1999, the "U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement" can increase the U.S. gross national product by 1% and Canada by 5%. The number of employed people in the two countries will increase by 500,000 and 850,000, respectively. The East Asian region, due to the deepening of internal economic interdependence, large capital and technological strength, and the continuous improvement of the economic circulation mechanism, will also have greater economic vitality. Due to the large economic scale of the three zones, their relatively rapid internal economic development and certain positive driving effects on the external economy will be beneficial to the development and relative stability of the world economy.

	International speculative capital will flow more into the "zones," especially into the "European Unified Large Market." Currently, there is a trend of mutual investment and market competition between Western Europe, North America, and East Asia. The most prominent are Japanese and American companies and enterprises, as well as the "Four Asian Tigers." To bypass the tariff barriers set by the European Community for external entities and to utilize its internal "four freedoms" opportunities, they are rushing into the European Community. It is estimated that the international speculative capital absorbed by the three economic zones will account for more than 80% of the total international credit funds.

	The international multilateral trading system will be further weakened, and international economic competition will become more intense and profound. Economic regionalization is a product of the background where the "free and fair competition principles" of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade are being destroyed, and the international multilateral trading system is becoming increasingly ineffective. The development of regionalization will further impact this system. Because one of the reasons for its emergence is to deal with intensified external competition, it is inevitable that it will produce exclusive, discriminatory, and protectionist policies and measures, making multilateral trade negotiations more difficult to achieve progress. Therefore, the development of Western economic regionalization trends may lead to a shift in the international economic competition pattern from the competition among the United States, Japan, and West Germany to the competition among the European Community, North America, and East Asia's three major regional economic "groups." This will be a higher-level, more complex struggle, which will inevitably make the competition more profound and sharp. However, due to the balance of power among the three "zones" and the deepening of their interdependence, they must adjust their relationships, coordinate, and cooperate as necessary while competing fiercely.

	International political relations will accelerate towards pluralism, which is beneficial to the further easing of the international situation. Economic regionalization is both a product and an important manifestation of the multipolarization of the world economy. The development of regionalization indicates the deepening of multipolarization. Economic multipolarization is the basis of political multipolarization. Its development will inevitably accelerate the pluralization of international political relations. Obviously, the development of economic regionalization has reduced the economic dependence of the allies of the United States and the Soviet Union on these two superpowers, and at the same time, the political control of the United States and the Soviet Union over their allies has also been weakened, and their influence and control over international affairs will decline.

	The economic relations in the East Asian region will present a new pattern. First, Japan's economic relations with the East Asian region, especially trade, will further develop. Second, Japan's increased direct investment in the East Asian region will promote the development of regional horizontal division of labor, which is beneficial to the high-level industrial structure and the play of comparative advantages in the region. Third, economic exchanges between regions will become more frequent, injecting new vitality into the entire region's economy.

	Of course, there will inevitably be intense competition among them.

　　三大经济圈剖析
    王居懿
    ８０年代中期以来，随着世界经济一体化和区域化趋势的发展，逐步形成了西欧、北美和东亚三个经济圈。这三大经济圈之间充满着竞争，但彼此间的相互依赖和合作关系也更加密切。
    　　　　三圈逐步形成　彼此各有特点
    欧洲共同市场：“三大经济圈”中参与国家最多、合作层次最高的一个。３０年前《罗马条约》生效时，西欧国家就开始走上经济联合的道路。筹建“统一大市场”则是从１９８５年开始的。目前欧洲共同体（西班牙、葡萄牙尚处在过渡阶段）已经建立了关税同盟，实施了共同农业政策，确立了欧洲货币体系，并正在向建立商品、资本、人员和劳务完全自由流通的“统一大市场”方向迈进。欧洲共同体加速推进区域经济合作，主要是为了增强经济活力，改善在国际竞争中的不利处境。进入８０年代以来，西欧的工业投资停步不前，失业率居高不下，经济增长速度明显放慢以及技术领先地位日渐丧失。如果欧洲“统一大市场”的计划目标得以在１９９２年初步实现，就可增强地区综合经济实力，提高欧共体对美国和日本的竞争地位。但是，欧共体实现“统一大市场”不会是一帆风顺的。首先，欧共体毕竟是由各个主权国家联合而成，各国既要维护主权和民族权益，又要最大程度的联合和统一，实现两者的平衡很不容易。其次，欧共体各国在对农业的补贴、统一增值税和间接税税率以及货币金融一体化等方面还存着利益分歧；第三，缩短欧共体内南、北方经济差距也需要一定的时间。但是，西欧要建立“统一大市场”已经达到“不可逆转”的阶段。因此，西欧到１９９２年即使“统一大市场”的某些计划目标不能完全达到，一个较高层次的“经济圈”的基本构架是可以确立的。
    北美“经济圈”：以美国为中心的双边“自由贸易区”。１９８０年里根在竞选总统时曾提出建立包括加拿大、墨西哥和加勒比海诸国在内的“北美共同市场”的设想。进入８０年代中期，由于美国在国际贸易领域的优势地位已不复存在，世界经济区域化趋势加强，关税及贸易总协定的调节机能下降，美国越来越感到需要加强同其经济关系比较密切的毗邻国家和地区，特别是加拿大的经济合作，以维护美国的国际经济地位。１９８６年６月美国同加拿大开始谈判签订“自由贸易协定”，历时一年半，终于在１９８８年１月２日由里根总统和马尔罗尼总理正式签署了“美加自由贸易协定”。该协定于１９８９年１月１日起生效，按规定，两国商品关税要分三批陆续于１９８９、１９９３和１９９８年１月降至零，使双方商品贸易全部免税；美国资本直接和间接购买加拿大公司的限额将予提高，两国在劳务合作方面将逐步给对方公民以国民待遇。美国同墨西哥也已于１９８７年１１月签署了“协议大纲”，并开始就两国贸易自由化的细节问题进行谈判。但由于两国的经济发展水平差距太大，双方达成签约协议将会费些周折。由上可见，８年前里根提出的建立“北美共同市场”的设想正在逐步实现。
    东亚“经济圈”：以日本为主导的无正式形式的经济联系与合作。近几年，构筑亚太地区经济圈的议论很多，但迄今政府间并无签订协议和正式筹建的具体行动。可是从东亚地区的经济关系看，实际上正在逐步形成一个由日本起主导作用、有着良好的经济循环机制的经济合作“圈”。它表现为区域内经济一体化趋势不断加强，特别是１９８５年以来，圈内国家对美国市场的依赖程度下降，而相互依赖程度提高；日本对圈内的直接投资幅度增加，并且出现了相互投资的新格局；圈内垂直分工关系减弱，而水平分工关系增强；日元在圈内的地位和作用上升，美元则相对下降。目前有些日本学者提出建立包括日本、亚洲“四小”、东盟和中国（有的主张不包括中国）共１０个国家和地区的“东亚经济圈”的设想，也有人主张结成同西欧、北美对抗的某种经济合作形式。但从现实情况看，在本世纪内在亚太地区形成类似西欧、北美那种契约式的经济合作组织的可能性极小。
    　　　　经济实力相当　竞争合作并行
    西欧、北美、东亚“三大经济圈”是世界经济、科技最发达的地区，国民生产总值和对外贸易总额合计占世界比重均在３／４左右；它们是世界三大工业加工基地和三大国际金融中心所在地，构成了世界经济的三极格局。
    从经济规模看，三个经济圈虽有较大差距，但各有不同的优势。欧洲共同体贸易额最大，且收支平衡。北美的生产规模最大，又是现代科技的主要发祥地，美国仍在世界经济中起领先作用，但其巨额贸易逆差表明它在国际竞争中处境困难。东亚经济圈尽管生产规模最小，但其贸易额与北美相当，且有巨大贸易顺差，显示出较强的国际竞争力。东亚地区包括中国在内，人口约占世界３０％以上，有着巨大的市场潜力。经济学界普遍认为，东亚经济圈将是世界经济中最有活力的地区，其经济实力地位和对世界经济的影响将继续增强。
    “三大经济圈”相互之间充满着竞争和斗争，贸易战、汇率战、利率战延绵不断。但另一方面，彼此间的相互依赖和利害关系又从未像现在这样密切，以至于对方的发展已成为自身发展不可缺少的外部条件。以进出口贸易为例，在１９７０到１９８７年的１７年间，日本和欧洲共同体之间增长了１４．５倍，东亚与北美之间增长了１２．５倍，其中亚洲“四小”同北美之间增长了４８倍，北美同欧洲共同体之间增长了６．１倍。至于日、美、欧之间的相互投资和人员、科技交流发展之快更为人们所瞩目。
    由于“三大经济圈”形成的背景不尽相同，内部情况参差不齐，因而内外依赖程度各不相同。欧洲共同体各国之间经济差距相对地小，水平分工发达，因而内部的“自我完结”能力较强。对外依赖程度较轻，而北美、东亚各国经济规模和水平相距较远，对外依赖程度相对深一些。以出口商品市场为例，１９８７年，欧洲共同体各国出口商品的５８％是在区域内消化的，而北美、东亚分别仅有３８．９％和４３．６％。
    　　　　促进经济发展　未来影响深远
    “三大经济圈”形成后，有利于增强“圈”内的经济活力，促进世界经济的发展和相对稳定。在各个“圈”内妨碍生产要素自由流通的各种障碍逐步减弱或取消的过程中，资源可以获得更有效的分配，并能发挥规模经济的效益。各成员国企业之间的竞争和兼并活动将会加剧，各国的固定资本投资会增加，产业结构调整的步伐会加快；优胜劣汰，势将使生产体制更加合理，生产效率得以提高，而成本和价格下降。此外，成员国之间存在着的矛盾和分歧也会得到更好的缓解和调整。区域内部各国经济因得到这些新因素的刺激而会加快发展。据欧洲共同体执委会１９８８年５月９日发表的研究报告估算，１９９２年统一市场建成后，欧共体国内生产总值可增长４．５％至５％，工业生产成本可降低７％，企业赢利增加１．８％，物价平均下降６％，并创造就业机会２００万个。西德科尔说，欧共体可能出现“经济复兴”。另据估计，到１９９９年，“美加自由贸易协定”可使美国国民生产总值增加１％，加拿大增加５％。两国就业人数将分别增加５０万和８５万。东亚地区由于内部经济相互依存度加深，资金和技术力量较大，经济循环机制不断得到改善，经济发展也将具有更大的活力。由于三个圈的经济规模庞大，其内部经济的较快发展和对外部经济所产生的某些积极的带动作用，将有利于整个世界经济的发展和相对稳定。
    国际游资将更多地流入“圈”内，特别是流入“欧洲统一大市场”内部。目前，西欧、北美和东亚地区之间正在形成相互投资、抢占市场的热潮。最为突出的是日本和美国及亚洲“四小”的公司和企业，为了绕过欧共体对外部所设的关税壁垒和利用其内部“四大自由流通”的机会，纷纷向欧共体内部进军。估计三个经济圈所吸收的国际游资将占整个国际信贷资金的８０％以上。
    国际多边贸易体制将进一步削弱，国际经济竞争将变得更加深刻和激烈。经济区域化是在“关税及贸易总协定”的“自由与公平竞争原则”受到破坏，国际多边贸易体制越来越不起作用的背景下产生的。而区域化的发展又将使这一体制受到进一步的冲击。因为，它的产生原因之一就是为了对付外部加强的竞争，因而不可避免地要产生排他性、歧视性等保护主义的政策和措施，使多边贸易谈判更加难以取得进展。所以，西方经济区域化趋势的发展可能导致国际经济竞争格局由美国、日本和西德三国的较量，走向欧共体、北美和东亚三大区域经济“集团”的竞争。这将是更高层次、更加复杂的斗争，势必使竞争变得更加深刻和尖锐。但是，由于三个“圈”实力上的均势和相互依存关系的加深，它们在激烈竞争的同时，还必须调整彼此关系，进行必要的协调和合作。
    国际政治关系将加速走向多元化，有利于国际局势的进一步缓和。经济区域化既是世界经济多极化的产物，也是它的重要表现。区域化的发展说明多极化的加深。经济多极化是政治多极化的基础。它的发展，势将使国际政治关系加速走向多元化。显然，经济区域化的发展，使得美国和苏联的盟国对这两个超级大国在经济上的依赖减轻，与此同时，美、苏对盟国的政治控制也就随之削弱，它们对国际事务的影响力和控制力将会下降。
    东亚地区的经济关系将出现新的格局。首先，日本同东亚地区的经济关系，尤其是贸易将会进一步发展。其次，日本增加对东亚地区的直接投资，将推动地区水平分工关系的发展，有利于地区产业结构的高级化和比较优势的发挥。再其次，地区之间经济交流将更趋频繁，并给整个地区的经济注入新的活力。
    当然，它们之间也必然产生激烈的竞争。
