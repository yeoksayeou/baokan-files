The newly reorganized Shanghai Academy of Sciences has integrated the scientific research forces of central government research institutions in Shanghai with those of local institutions, actively participating in Shanghai's economic construction and achieving remarkable results. In 1988, various research institutions completed 128 important scientific and technological achievements and undertook 55 projects funded by the Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Development Fund.

The Shanghai Academy of Sciences has 27 research institutions covering a wide range of technical fields and numerous professional disciplines. Over the past year, the Academy has organized its scientific and technological personnel to participate in key scientific and technological breakthrough projects and urban construction in Shanghai. In the first batch of 98 topics for the 14 key projects that were publicly tendered, the Academy won 15 bids and, with its comprehensive technical advantages, facilitated the realization of these projects. The "80MB Disk Drive" project, won by the East China Institute of Computer Technology, had its disk drive motor developed by the 21st Institute; the 21st Institute's participation in the tender for the "Automatic Ticket Vending System" for the subway was supported by the 23rd Institute, which has advantages in optical fiber line research, thus securing the bid. The Shanghai Academy of Sciences promptly provided relevant information and data on Shanghai's 14 key projects to the relevant research institutions, giving them the opportunity to compete.

The research institutions affiliated with the Shanghai Academy of Sciences pay great attention to participating in the technological transformation of Shanghai's traditional industries and supporting township enterprises. The variable-speed hydraulic coupler developed by the 711st Institute has been promoted in dozens of steel and cement plants across 22 provinces and municipalities nationwide, saving the country 700 million kilowatt-hours of electricity.

The Shanghai Academy of Sciences has strong development capabilities. Over the past year, various research institutions have made beneficial explorations in technological development and the development of an outward-looking economy. They have designed more than 10 types of ships for shipowners in Italy, Australia, Singapore, and Hong Kong, earning considerable foreign exchange.

　　夺标攻关　开发创汇    
    上海科学院为当地经济插翅
    本报上海２月１２日电  记者萧关根报道：重新组建的上海科学院将中央在沪科研单位与本市科研单位的科技力量融合在一起，积极参加上海市的经济建设，取得了可喜的成绩。１９８８年，各研究单位共完成重要科技成果１２８项，承担市科学技术发展基金项目５５个。
    上海科学院有２７个科研单位，技术领域广，专业门类多。一年多来，该院组织科技人员参与上海经济建设中的重点科技攻关项目和市政建设，在１４个重点项目首批公开招标的９８项课题中，夺标１５项，并以全院的综合技术优势促成项目落实。由华东计算技术研究所夺标的“８０ＭＢ磁盘机”项目中的磁盘机电机，是由２１所承担的；２１所参与地铁“自动检售票机系统”项目招标时，因为得到了在光缆线路研究方面有优势的２３所的支持，所以一举夺标。上科院及时将上海市１４个重点项目的有关资料和信息发给有关研究单位，使他们都有机会参与竞争。
    上科院所属研究单位很注意参加上海传统工业的技术改造和支援乡镇企业。上海７１１所的调速液力耦合器在全国２２个省市的几十家钢铁厂和水泥厂推广后，已为国家节电７亿度。
    上科院有较强的开发能力。一年来，各研究单位在技术开发和发展外向型经济方面作了有益的探索。他们已为意大利、澳大利亚、新加坡和香港的船东研究设计了１０多种型号的船舶，创汇十分可观。
