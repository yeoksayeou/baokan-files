UN Secretary-General Calls for Establishment of Broad-Based Government in Afghanistan
Soviet Union Reveals Small Number of Military Advisors Remain in Kabul

NEW YORK, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) — UN Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar today called on the international community to seize the opportunity presented by the Soviet Union's completion of its withdrawal from Afghanistan to fully and fairly implement the Geneva Accords and establish a broad-based government in Afghanistan.

In a report submitted to the Security Council on the work of the UN Coordination Group in monitoring the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, the Secretary-General said that with the Soviet withdrawal, the external aspects of the Afghan problem have been resolved, allowing the Afghan people to determine their own future and achieve national peace and stability.

He emphasized that the next step should be decided by the Afghan people themselves, and the world's attention should focus on the efforts of the Afghan people to establish a broad-based government.

Pérez de Cuéllar said that the UN Coordination Group will continue to work towards this goal.

The Geneva Accords on the settlement of the Afghan problem stipulate that the Soviet Union should withdraw all its troops from Afghanistan by February 15 of this year, and that a broad-based government should be established in Afghanistan after the Soviet withdrawal.

Pérez de Cuéllar said that the Geneva Accords should be implemented "in full."

MOSCOW, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) — Soviet Deputy Defense Minister and Army Commander-in-Chief Marshal Valentin Varennikov said that over the past nine years, the Soviet military has suffered 15,000 deaths, 36,000 injuries, and 312 missing in Afghanistan. After the complete withdrawal of Soviet troops, a small number of Soviet military advisors remain in Kabul government departments.

He revealed these figures at the first press conference held after the complete withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan. Varennikov, who had served as the representative of the Soviet military command in Afghanistan, was appointed as the Soviet Army Commander-in-Chief upon his return to the country.

Varennikov also told Tass reporters today that there are 30 Soviet military advisors remaining in Afghanistan. Their mission is to provide various assistance to the Kabul regime and ensure the delivery of food and other supplies by Soviet aircraft.

Soviet First Deputy Foreign Minister Besmertnykh announced at the press conference that yesterday, the Soviet Union sent special letters to the leaders of the United States, Britain, France, West Germany, China, Iran, and Pakistan, urging them to provide economic and humanitarian aid to Afghanistan.

　　联合国秘书长向安理会提交报告    
    呼吁阿建立有广泛基础的政府    
    苏披露少量军事顾问仍留在喀布尔
    新华社联合国２月１７日电  联合国秘书长佩雷斯·德奎利亚尔今天呼吁抓住苏联完成从阿富汗撤军的契机，全面、公正地执行日内瓦协议，在阿富汗建立一个具有广泛基础的政府。
    秘书长在提交给安理会的关于联合国协调小组监督苏联撤军情况的工作报告中说，苏联撤军后，阿富汗问题的外部方面已经解决，阿富汗人民因此能够决定他们的未来和实现国家的和平与稳定。
    他强调说，下一步只应由阿富汗人民自己去决定，全世界的注意力应该集中到阿富汗人民为建立一个具有广泛基础的政府所作的努力上。
    佩雷斯·德奎利亚尔说，联合国协调小组将为实现这一目标继续工作。
    关于解决阿富汗问题的日内瓦协议规定苏联在今年２月１５日前将它的全部军队撤出阿富汗，并且规定在苏联撤军后，在阿富汗建立一个具有广泛基础的政府。
    佩雷斯·德奎利亚尔说，日内瓦协议应当“完整”地执行。
    新华社莫斯科２月１７日电　苏联国防部副部长兼陆军总司令瓦连尼科夫大将说，９年多来，苏军在阿富汗共死亡１．５万人，伤３．６万人，另有３１２人失踪。苏军全部撤离后，还有少量的苏联军事顾问留在喀布尔政府部门。
    他是今天在苏军完全撤离阿富汗后举行的首次记者招待会上披露这些数字的。瓦连尼科夫曾任苏联军事指挥机关驻阿富汗的代表，回国后即被任命为苏联陆军总司令。
    瓦连尼科夫今天还对塔斯社记者说，留在阿富汗的苏联军事顾问有３０名。其任务是向喀布尔政权提供各种帮助，保障苏联飞机运送食品和其他物资。
    苏联第一副外长别斯梅尔特内赫在记者招待会上宣布，昨天苏联已向美国、英国、法国、西德、中国、伊朗和巴基斯坦等国领导人发出专门信件，呼吁他们向阿富汗提供经济和人道主义援助。
