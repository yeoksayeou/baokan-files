In the enterprise, whether you are an operator or a manager, who wants the factory to always be an "old cow and broken cart"? Who doesn't hope that their enterprise can quickly enter the ranks of modernization? However, under the old system, enterprises could only patiently "wait," firmly "rely," and repeatedly "ask." The results of waiting, relying, and asking were: modernization was within reach but unattainable!

Reform has created miracles! Ten years ago, Shougang, which was once mocked by foreign counterparts as the "World Metallurgy Museum," implemented the profit-sharing contract system. This system allowed Shougang to modernize its main equipment, significantly improving production capacity and economic benefits:

- Steel products increased from 116.9 million tons to 310 million tons, equivalent to not spending a single cent of state investment to add a large steel plant for the country;
- Pure profit increased by an average of 20% per year for 10 consecutive years, from 299 million yuan in 1978 to 1.614 billion yuan in 1988;
- Over 10 years, a total of 7 billion yuan in profits, taxes, and fees were paid to the state, and 2.6 billion yuan in self-raised funds were used to increase fixed assets for the state, contributing a total of 9.6 billion yuan to the state. This is equivalent to contributing one original Shougang and the Beijing Metallurgical Bureau to the state every year.

Many comrades find Shougang's transformation unbelievable and want them to reveal their secrets! Shougang's comrades candidly "revealed" to me: From a broad perspective, it was the good policy of the contract system given by the Central Committee of the Party and the State Council that enabled the enterprise to have the ability of "self-accumulation, self-improvement, and self-development." From a specific method, it was that we, during the modernization of the enterprise, always pursued low investment, quick output, and high efficiency...

“Don’t Kill the Laying Hen”

Shougang is an enterprise with a 70-year history. By the time of the reform, it was still using early 20th-century Ford-type boilers, late Qing Dynasty steam turbines, and obsolete waste heat coking ovices that had been discarded by foreigners. Many main equipment that had been running for 20 to 30 years were still at the technological and operational level of the 1940s and 1950s. Shougang's leaders believed: achieving modernization is a process and cannot be done in one step. For those old equipment that are energy-intensive, inefficient, and polluting, they should indeed be phased out as soon as possible. However, for some equipment that, although "old," are not yet "weak," they should still be allowed to continue to "serve," and should not be indiscriminately "cut off." They called this guiding ideology "don't kill the laying hen."

For example, the main equipment of Shougang's experimental plant, a 3-ton pit-type small converter, was completed in September 1958 and had been running continuously for 25 years. The arc-type small continuous casting machine in the plant had also been with the small converter for about 20 years. But Shougang people did not mind their "rustic" appearance. During the "Sixth Five-Year Plan," they carried out three major renovations and potential improvements. As a result, the converter's steel output increased from 10.29 million tons in 1978 to 42.5 million tons in 1988, reaching four times the design capacity and becoming one of the few "first-class furnaces" in the country. The output of continuous casting billets increased from 1.59 million tons in 1978 to 37.88 million tons in 1988, an increase of 22.82 times, making it a top-class continuous casting machine in the country. The annual process profit exceeded 300 million yuan, an increase of more than 10 times compared to 1980. The 74.5 million yuan invested in the three renovations had long since been recovered many times over. Practice has proven that technological renovations of old equipment that can still work are like taking tonic medicine, which can indeed achieve the goal of "prolonging life and strengthening the body."

“Raising Horses, Raise Thoroughbreds”

If the non-main equipment in the enterprise is compared to "chickens," then the key equipment on the main process should be compared to "horses." In Shougang, on the one hand, it is "don't kill the laying hen." On the other hand, for those "old horses," "lame horses," and "crippled horses" that cannot pull the cart or carry the load, they adopt comprehensive renovation methods to decisively eliminate them and replace them with "thousand-mile horses" that can reflect the organic unity of technological progress and economic benefits and have advanced domestic and foreign levels in the 1980s. In other words, for main equipment, one renovation means one modernization. In recent years, the second, third, and fourth blast furnaces, the first sintering workshop, the second wire rod mill, and the boiler room have been renovated.

For example, the original No. 2 blast furnace, which was moved from Japan before liberation, adopted 37 advanced new technologies and processes during the renovation, both domestic and foreign. Those that exist abroad, such as no-bell furnace top, automatic control of charging, pressure difference power generation, etc., are all here. Those that do not exist abroad, such as top-burning hot blast stove, probability sieve, and fully cast multi-ring tuyere, which are Shougang's own special technologies, are also used here. After the renovation, the wind temperature of the No. 2 blast furnace increased from 800°C to 1200°C, and the utilization coefficient increased from 1.345 tons/cubic meter to more than 2.1 tons/cubic meter. The coke ratio entering the furnace decreased from 600 kg/ton to less than 380 kg/ton. The purification degree of the blast furnace is above 95%, which is also first-class in the world. An American metallurgical design expert said: Shougang's No. 2 blast furnace is the best blast furnace I have seen. A Japanese ironmaking colleague said: Such a blast furnace is rare in Japan.

“More Flour, Add More Water; More Water, Add More Flour”

Shougang's comrades believe that steel production is continuous and the process flow is interlinked. However, imbalances between production links are common. By renovating backward links, the overall production capacity of the enterprise can be further improved. But new imbalances will appear, and new technological renovations will be needed. In this way, the contradictions that arise continuously are solved through renovations and potential improvements, and the production capacity and economic benefits of the enterprise will improve year by year. For example, at the beginning of the reform, the main contradiction was that the "leading" iron-making plant of steel production was backward. They quickly renovated the No. 2, No. 3, and No. 4 blast furnaces. Next, there was a shortage of ore supply, so they adopted new technologies and processes such as fine screening and grinding, magnetic wheel dry selection, and magnetic agglomeration heavy selection, increasing the amount of concentrate powder by nearly one time, achieving self-sufficiency and surplus. In the case of steel production being lower than iron-making and rolling, the First Steelmaking Plant took major renovation measures such as thinning the converter wall, expanding the furnace shell, and top-bottom combined blowing, making the steel output in 1987 reach 22.2 million tons, equivalent to 3.5 times the original design capacity...

For each basic process renovation, the policy of "more flour, add more water; more water, add more flour" is also effective. For example, the initial rolling mill of Shougang, with an original design capacity of 6.2 million tons of steel billets per year. After the steel output increased, it could not be rolled, and a large amount of steel billets had to be transported out. In response to the imbalance in rolling capacity, the renovation of the initial rolling mill was carried out in several steps. First, in response to the insufficient steelmaking capacity, 8 heating furnace pits were added, making full use of the capacity of the 850 rolling mill, and the billet output increased by 24%. Later, in response to the insufficient production capacity of small square billets, two 650 rolling mills were added. After the production of small square billets increased, the main motor of the 850 rolling mill often overloaded, hindering the further increase in output. Therefore, a larger main motor was replaced for the 850 rolling mill, increasing the billet output by another 10%. Later, the cross-rolling mill was renovated into an independent drive, increasing the production of small square billets by another 15%... Through such continuous renovations, the output of the initial rolling mill reached more than three times the design capacity.

“Spend the Price of a Pig, Buy a Big Bull”

The saying "cheap goods are not good, good goods are not cheap" has some truth to it. However, Shougang's leaders, with their wisdom and courage, created the miracle of "spending the price of a pig, buying a big bull" when introducing foreign equipment.

Starting in 1982, industrial production in some European and American countries was very sluggish. Shougang's leaders judged that Western steel industries might undergo structural adjustments. After 1983, this prediction became a reality, and many steel plants closed one after another. Just in the United States, the idle steel production capacity was six to seven thousand tons. Shougang seized this rare opportunity and bought just-idled metallurgical equipment from Europe and America everywhere, spending almost the same amount of money as buying scrap steel.

For example, the medium and heavy plate mill with an annual output of 30-50 million tons introduced from the United States, 1.1 million tons of equipment only cost 2.225 million US dollars; the high-speed wire rod rolling mill with a rolling speed of 80 meters per second only cost 17 million US dollars, equivalent to only 1/5 of the original value; the 29 American torpedo-shaped molten iron ladle cars that cannot be manufactured in China at present cost a total of 430,000 US dollars, only 30,000 US dollars more than a new ladle car. Especially the second steelmaking plant with an annual output of 300 million tons of steel that was put into production before the National Day in 1987, the main part of which is second-hand equipment introduced from Belgium, with a total weight of 49,000 tons, only cost 12.5 million US dollars, equivalent to about 400 million yuan. This includes two large converters with a capacity of 210 tons each, 11 large cranes, a 26,000-square-meter steel structure workshop, a total capacity of 29,000 kilowatts of 360 electric motors, and 336 tons of cables. Including dismantling, transportation, and modification, configuration, and renovation costs, and construction and installation costs, the investment in the converter workshop is only 2.4 billion yuan. Plus the two 8-flow continuous casting machines (there are only 7 such machines in the world) that match the converter workshop, the total investment is only 4 billion yuan, equivalent to only 1/3 of the investment in introducing a new steel plant of the same scale from abroad. Moreover, from the beginning of dismantling to the completion of steel production, the entire time was less than two years, which is one to two times faster than the construction period of a new plant built by foreigners.

　　投入少产出快效益高
　　——首钢现代化改造探秘
    本报记者　江世杰
    在企业工作的人，不管是操作工还是厂长，谁愿意工厂总是“老牛破车”？谁不希望自己的企业尽快进入现代化行列？然而在旧体制下，企业只能耐心地“等”、坚决地“靠”、反复地“要”。等、靠、要的结果是：现代化可望而不可及！
    改革，创造了奇迹！１０年前曾经被外国同行们嘲笑为“世界冶金博物馆”的首钢，通过实行上交利润递增包干的承包制，一举实现了主体设备现代化，从而大幅度提高了生产能力和经济效益：
    ——成品钢材从１１６．９万吨提高到３１０万吨，等于没要国家一分钱投资，就为国家增加了一个大型钢铁厂；
    ——纯利润连续１０年平均每年递增２０％，由１９７８年的２．９９亿增至１９８８年的１６．１４亿元；
    ——１０年累计上交国家利润、税金、费用７０亿元，加上用自筹资金为国家新增固定资产２６亿元，共计为国家贡献９６亿元，相当于平均每年为国家贡献一个原来的首钢加北京市冶金局；
    ……
    许多同志觉得，首钢的巨变不可思议，要求他们和盘托出尚未公开的秘密！首钢的同志坦诚地向我“交底”：从大的方面说，是党中央、国务院给了我们承包制这个好政策，使企业具有了“自我积累，自我改造，自我发展”的能力；从具体方法上讲，是我们对企业进行现代化改造时，始终追求投入少、产出快、效益高……
　“下蛋的母鸡不急杀”
    首钢是有７０年历史的老企业，到改革开始时，还用本世纪初的福特式锅炉，慈禧时代的汽轮机和外国早已淘汰的废热式炼焦炉在“顶岗”。许多已经运转二三十年的主体设备，也只是４０年代、５０年代的技术、工艺水平。首钢领导人认为：实现现代化是一个过程，不可能“一步登天”。对那些耗能高、效率低、污染重的老设备，固然应该尽快淘汰；可对有些虽然“年老”但并不算“体衰”的设备，还是应该让它们继续“服役”，切不可不加区别地一刀“切”下来。他们把这个指导思想叫作“下蛋的母鸡不急杀”。
    例如，首钢试验厂的主要设备３吨地坑式小转炉，建成于１９５８年９月，已经连续运转了２５年。该厂的弧形小连铸机，也已经与小转炉相伴２０来年。但首钢人不嫌它们“土气”，“六五”期间先后３次对其改造挖潜。结果，转炉钢产量从１９７８年的１０．２９万吨提高到１９８８年的４２．５万吨，达到设计能力的４倍，成为全国为数不多的“一等炉”；连铸坯产量，由１９７８年的１．５９万吨提高到１９８８年的３７．８８万吨，提高了２２．８２倍，成为全国特等连铸机；一年的工序利润超过３０００万元，比１９８０年提高１０多倍。３次改造所花的７４５万元投资，早已超过多少倍地收回了。实践证明，对尚能出力的老设备进行技术改造像是服用强身补剂，确实能达到“延年益寿”、“老当益壮”的目的。
　“养马要养千里马”
    如果将企业中的非主体设备比之为“鸡”，那么，对那些主要工序上的关键设备，则应喻之为“马”。在首钢，一方面是“下蛋的母鸡不急杀”。另一方面，对那些确实不能拉车、负重的“老马”、“跛马”、“残马”则采取整体性改造办法坚决淘汰，代之以能体现技术进步与经济效益有机统一的、具有８０年代国内外先进水平的“千里马”。也就是说，对主体设备要做到改造一个就现代化一个。几年来，已先后改造了第二、三、四号高炉，第一烧结车间，第二线材厂和锅炉房。
    例如，解放前从日本迁来的原二高炉，改造时采用了国内外３７项先进的新技术和新工艺。国外有的，如无料钟炉顶、上料自动控制、压差发电等，这里都有了。国外没有的，如顶燃式热风炉、概率筛、全铸多环风口等首钢自己的专项技术，这里也用上了。改造后的二高炉和改造前相比，风温从８００℃提高到１２００℃，利用系数从１．３４５吨／立方米提高到２．１吨／立方米以上；入炉焦比从６００公斤／吨降到３８０公斤／吨以下；高炉净化程度在９５％以上，这在世界上也属第一流水平。美国一位冶金设计专家说：首钢第二高炉是我所看到的最好的高炉。一位日本炼铁同行说：像这样的高炉在日本也少见。
　“面多加水，水多加面”
    首钢的同志认为，钢铁生产连续性强，工序流程一环扣一环。但生产环节之间的不平衡是常见的。通过对落后环节的技术改造，就可使整个企业的生产能力进一步提高。但以后还会出现新的不平衡，又需要进行新的技术改造。就这样，不断产生的矛盾，通过改造、挖潜来不断解决，企业生产能力和经济效益就会一年上一个台阶。例如，改革开始时，主要矛盾是钢铁生产的“龙头”——炼铁厂生产水平落后，他们就抓紧改造二、三、四号高炉；接着是矿石供应不足，他们就采用细筛再磨、磁滑轮干选、磁团聚重选等新技术、新工艺，使精矿粉增加近１倍，做到了自给有余；在钢产量低于炼铁和轧材的情况下，第一炼钢厂先后采取减薄转炉炉壁、扩大炉壳、顶底复合吹炼等重大改造措施，使１９８７年钢产量达到２２２万吨，相当于原设计能力的３．５倍……
    对于每一道基础工序的技术改造来说，“面多加水，水多加面”的方针也是行之有效的。例如，首钢初轧厂，原设计能力是年开钢坯６２万吨。钢产量提高后轧不过来，大量钢坯只好外运。针对轧钢能力不配套的矛盾，初轧厂的改造分了几步走。首先针对烧钢能力不足，增加了８个均热炉坑，使８５０轧机的能力得到充分发挥，开坯量增加了２４％；后来又针对小方坯生产能力不足的问题，增加了两台６５０轧机；小方坯产量增加后反过来又使８５０轧机主电机经常超负荷运转，阻碍了产量进一步提高，于是，又为８５０轧机更换了一台功率更大的主电机，使开坯量又增加１０％；后来，再次改造了横列式轧机为单独驱动，又使小方坯增产１５％……经过这样的不断改造，初轧机产量达到了设计能力的３倍多。
　“只花猪价钱，专买大牯牛”
    俗语“便宜没好货，好货不便宜”，讲的有道理。但首钢领导人却以其智慧和魄力，在引进外国设备时创造了“只花猪价钱，专买大牯牛”的奇迹。
    １９８２年起，欧美一些国家工业生产很不景气。首钢领导人判断，西方钢铁工业可能要进行结构性调整。１９８３年以后，这种预言变成了现实，许多钢厂一个接一个关炉停产，仅美国闲置的钢生产能力就有六七千万吨。首钢抓住这个难得的机会，在欧美到处搜买刚停产的冶金设备，花的钱几乎同买废钢的价钱一样低。
    例如，从美国引进的年产３０—５０万吨的中厚板厂，１．１万吨设备只花了２２２．５万美元；轧制速度每秒８０米的高速线材轧机，只花了１７００万美元，仅相当原价值的１／５；国内目前还不能制造的２９台美国鱼雷形铁水罐车，总共花了４３万美元，只比一台新罐车多３万美元。特别是１９８７年国庆节前投产的年产３００万吨钢的首钢第二炼钢厂，主体部分是从比利时引进的二手设备，总重４．９万吨，只花了１２５０万美元，折合人民币约４０００万元。其中包括一次能炼２１０吨钢的大型转炉两座，大型吊车１１台，２．６万平方米钢结构厂房，总容量２．９万千瓦的３６０台电机，以及３３６吨电缆。加上拆迁运输和修、配、改费用和建筑安装费，转炉车间的投资只有２．４亿元。再加上与转炉车间配套的两台８流连铸机（全世界目前只有７台），总共投资也才４亿元，仅相当于从国外引进全新设备建一座同等规模钢厂投资的１／３。而且，从开始拆迁到建成出钢，全部时间不到两年，比由外国人包建新厂，建设周期要快一两倍。
