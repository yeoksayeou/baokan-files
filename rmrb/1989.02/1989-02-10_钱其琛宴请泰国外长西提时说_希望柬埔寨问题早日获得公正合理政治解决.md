	Qian Qichen Hosts Dinner for Thai Foreign Minister Siddhi

	BEIJING, Feb. 9 (Xinhua) -- "The parties concerned are in frequent contact and dialogue to seek an early solution to the Cambodian problem, and the hotspot issue in this region has entered a crucial stage of political resolution," Qian Qichen, Chinese Foreign Minister, said tonight when hosting a dinner for Thai Foreign Minister Siddhi Savetsila and his entourage at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse.

	Qian said: "At present, the international situation is easing, and the situation in Southeast Asia is undergoing new changes. We welcome this positive development, but we also note that there are still many problems and difficulties on the way forward. In this context, the friendly and cooperative relations between China and Thailand are an important factor in easing the regional situation. China and Thailand have broad consensus and good cooperation on the Cambodian issue. We both hope that the Cambodian problem will be resolved fairly and reasonably through political means as soon as possible."

	Siddhi, in his reply, said: "My visit to China this time coincides with a crucial moment when the Cambodian problem is heading towards a solution. In the process of further advancing the resolution of the Cambodian problem, cooperation among countries, especially between Thailand and China, will play a significant role."

	Siddhi pointed out: "A fair and realistic political solution to the Cambodian problem requires, in addition to the complete withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Cambodia, the national reconciliation of Cambodia led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk. The Prince is the only leader of Cambodia recognized by the Cambodian people and the international community. Moreover, the above two issues are interrelated and should be promoted simultaneously. This is not only for the stability and security of this region but also for the interests of all Cambodians to avoid possible civil war."

	Those present at the dinner included Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Liu Shuxiang and Thai Ambassador to China Dej Bunnag, among others.

	Siddhi and his entourage arrived in Beijing this afternoon at the invitation of Qian Qichen.

　　钱其琛宴请泰国外长西提时说
　　希望柬埔寨问题早日获得公正合理政治解决
    本报北京２月９日讯  记者温宪报道：“有关各方为寻求柬问题的早日解决正在进行频繁接触和对话，本地区热点问题已进入政治解决的关键阶段。”这番话是中国外交部长钱其琛今晚在钓鱼台国宾馆宴请泰国外长西提·沙卫西拉一行时说的。
    钱外长说：“目前，国际形势趋向缓和，东南亚形势正在发生新的变化”，“我们欢迎这一积极发展，但也注意到前进的道路上还有不少问题和困难。在这种形势下，中泰两国的友好合作关系，对缓和地区形势是一个重要的因素。中国与泰国在柬埔寨问题上有着广泛一致的看法和良好的合作。我们都希望柬埔寨问题早日获得公正、合理的政治解决。”
    西提外长在答辞中说：“我此次访问中国，正值柬埔寨问题趋向于获得解决的重要关键时刻”，“在争取为柬埔寨问题的解决取得进一步进展的道路上，各国之间的合作，特别是泰国和中国之间的合作将具有很大的作用。”
    西提外长指出：“柬埔寨问题公正和现实的政治解决，除了越南应从柬埔寨全部撤军外，以西哈努克亲王为首的柬埔寨民族和解也是十分重要的。亲王是柬埔寨人民和国际社会所公认的唯一的柬埔寨领导人，同时上述两个问题在解决的过程中是相互关联的两个方面，应该努力促使其同步推进。这不仅是为了这个地区的稳定和安全，同时也是为了所有柬埔寨人避免可能发生内战的利益。”
    出席宴会的还有中国副外长刘述卿和泰国驻华大使德·汶纳阁下等。
    西提外长一行是应钱其琛外长邀请，于今天下午抵达北京的。
