The tomb of Weng Tonghe, the "dismissed minister of the Qing dynasty," is located by the Qinshui River at the foot of Yushan Mountain.

Weng Tonghe served as the imperial tutor for both the Tongzhi and Guangxu emperors, particularly having a special relationship with the Guangxu Emperor. From a young age, he not only appreciated the rituals and institutions of past dynasties but also enjoyed discussing the "Rites of Zhou." He was often ridiculed by his friends as being "pedantic." Perhaps because he was a "traditional" scholar who upheld feudal ethics and the feudal system, from the fourth year of the Tongzhi reign (1865), when he began serving in the Hongde Hall as the Tongzhi Emperor's tutor, the two empress dowagers favored him greatly. The Empress Dowager even encouraged him with the words, "I know your loyalty and sincerity."

Another reason the court trusted Weng Tonghe was that in 1867, when Prince Gong Yixuan was in charge of the Zongli Yamen, he petitioned to establish a School of Astronomy and Mathematics and to invite foreign teachers. At that time, neither Weng Tonghe nor the equally ignorant of Western affairs Weng Tonghe opposed the introduction of Western civilization, arguing that "since ancient times, the establishment of a country has always emphasized rites and morality rather than strategies; astronomy and mathematics are the least important of the six arts and their benefits are minimal; Westerners are our great enemies, and inviting them would undermine national dignity and lose the support of the people."

The Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895 exposed the decay and contradictions of the Qing dynasty's closed-door policy, shocking the people who had been blind and deaf to the outside world. Many people finally realized the necessity of reform. Weng Tonghe, who was known for his loyalty and filial piety, suddenly awakened and loudly called for reform as the only way to save the nation. He not only lectured on Western methods in his study, enlightening the Guangxu Emperor about reform and innovation, but also, as a high-ranking official, humbly visited the low-ranking official Kang Youwei, acting as a bridge between the reformers and the Guangxu Emperor, and personally participating in the great "Hundred Days' Reform" of Chinese history, drafting the imperial edict for the Guangxu Emperor to announce the national policy and implement reforms. After the reform failed, conservative forces, using the Guangxu Emperor's name, ordered the removal of Weng Tonghe's position as Vice President of the Board of Revenue and Minister of Household Affairs, expelling him from Beijing and sending him back to his hometown of Changshu.

Today, people remember Weng Tonghe, which, to some extent, shows respect for those who, after hitting a wall on the old track, sought innovation with the nation in mind. The souls of the Grand Councilor Gang Yi, who was ignorant and incompetent, publicly shouting, "Rather be annihilated than reform," and Rong Lu, who insisted on "the laws of the ancestors cannot be changed," are at least numb.

　　翁同和其人
    木森
    “清故削籍大臣”翁同和之墓坐落在琴水之边虞山脚下。
    翁同和曾身膺同、光两朝帝师，特别是与光绪皇帝有着特殊的关系。他幼时不但欣赏历代典章制度，尤好谈《周礼》，常常被朋友目为“迂”而“笑”之。也许由于他是个“正统”的维护封建伦理道德和封建纪纲的知识分子的缘故，从同治四年（１８６５年）入值弘德殿，作了同治皇帝的师傅起，两宫皇太后对其宠眷不衰，西太后甚至以“知汝忠悃”相勉。
    朝廷对翁同和信任的另一个原因，就是１８６７年恭亲王奕?主持总理衙门时，曾奏请开设天文算学馆，延聘外国教师。当时对洋务一窍不通的倭仁和翁同和都以“自古立国，从来是尚礼义不尚权谋；天文算学是六艺之末，为益甚微；西人为我大仇大敌，延聘西人上亏国体，下失民心”为由，顽固地拒绝西方文明的轮子驶入中国。
    甲午中日战争，大清王朝闭关腐朽和充满矛盾的原形暴露无遗，邻国和西方社会的工业文明，终于使闭目塞听的臣民深为震动，许多人终于意识到“变法”的必要性。向以忠君、孝悌闻名于士林的翁同和，这时也猛然省悟，终于“声震殿宇”地疾呼试想处今日之世，除了变法还有什么其他更好的办法来救亡图存！他不但在书房“日讲西法之良”，启发光绪帝变法维新，甚至以堂堂一品大员的高贵身份，屈驾走访六品小官康有为，甘当维新派与光绪帝之间联系的桥梁，并亲身参与中国历史上伟大的“百日维新”，执笔拟就为光绪帝宣布国是、实行变法的诏书。“变法”失败后，保守势力借光绪帝的名义下令撤去翁同和协办大学士户部尚书的职务，将他撵出北京，逐回常熟老家。
    今天人们之所以怀念翁同和，从某种意义讲，表明了人们尊重那些在旧的轨道上行走碰壁之后而以国为重的求索维新者的优秀灵魂。而那个文墨极浅，不学无术，公开叫嚷：“宁可亡国，决不变法”的军机大臣刚毅和那个坚持“祖宗之法不能变”的荣禄的灵魂至少是麻木的。
