One day in early spring, the capital airport—the largest aviation hub in China—was bustling with activity. A flight from Beijing to Guangzhou was scheduled to depart in just 15 minutes.

A young man hurried to the security gate with a tape recorder in hand. As he passed through the security gate, the recorder's image on the monitor screen showed something unusual.

The armed police officer and duty inspector, Xiao Li, immediately picked up the recorder. "What's inside?" he asked.

"Nothing..." the young man, surnamed Wang, replied. He was an individual entrepreneur from Beijing.

Xiao Li took out a screwdriver and acted as if he was going to open the recorder to see Wang's reaction.

"I'm not trying to hijack the plane, why are you damaging my recorder?" Wang panicked.

Xiao Li decisively opened the recorder, revealing a one-foot-long bayonet hidden inside the hollowed-out recorder! Wang had no choice but to lower his head. He admitted that he was carrying a large amount of cash and wanted to use the bayonet for self-defense.

For various reasons, some passengers try every means to bring knives, ammunition, detonators, and firearms on board. Some hide knives inside large toothpaste tubes, while others conceal spring-loaded knives in the soles of their boots... The myriad "hiding techniques" cannot escape the sharp eyes of the security personnel at the capital airport. An American tourist approached the security gate for inspection, and armed police officer Yan Guangqing noticed something suspicious in the tourist's suitcase on the security check screen. He requested an inspection. The American tourist calmly took out his plane ticket from Shanghai, which he had just arrived on, and gestured that it had been checked a few hours ago and didn't need to be checked again. Yan insisted on a routine inspection, and the tourist reluctantly opened his suitcase. Yan found a U.S. military-style spring-loaded dagger hidden in the deepest layer of the suitcase. The American tourist, speaking broken Chinese, said, "I intentionally brought the dagger to test the Asian security gate. I've been to several airports, and they didn't find the dagger. I didn't expect you to find it. Amazing! Amazing!"

The capital airport's security gate truly lives up to its name. Last year alone, they discovered 9,921 prohibited items and weapons, providing crucial security for domestic and international flights!

　　曝光在安全门下
    初春的一天，首都机场——我国最大的航空港一片繁忙景象。从北京到广州的飞机离起飞时间只有１５分钟了。
    一位年轻人手提录音机，匆匆来到安全门下。就在他经过安全门时，录音机在监测屏幕上的投影出现了异样。
    武警战士、值班检查员小李当即提起录音机。“里面藏了什么？”
    “没什么……”年轻人姓王，是北京的一位个体户。
    小李拿出螺丝刀，做出打开录音机机壳的动作，看王某作何反应。
    “我又不想劫机，你干吗弄坏录音机？”个体户果然慌了。
    小李果断地拆开录音机，一把一尺长的刺刀赫然藏在掏空了的录音机内！王某不得不低下了头。他说身上带有巨额现钞，想用这把刺刀防身。
    出于种种原因，总有一些旅客千方百计想把匕首、弹药、雷管和枪支携带登机。有的将刀子藏进大号牙膏皮内，有的将弹簧刀藏在皮靴的底层……五花八门的“隐藏术”，难逃首都机场保安部门一双双锐利的眼睛。一位美国旅客来到安全门下检查时，武警阎广清从安全检查机的屏幕上，发现他随身携带的皮箱里有疑点，要求开箱检查。这位美国旅客不慌不忙地从皮夹里掏出他刚从上海飞来的机票，打了一个手势，意思是几个小时前才检查过，没必要再检查了。小阎仍坚持例行检查，这位旅客无奈，只好打开皮箱。小阎从皮箱最底层的夹缝中查出了一支美式军用弹簧匕首。这位美国旅客用生硬的汉语说：“我是故意带着匕首来试试亚洲安全门的。我到过好几个机场，都没查出这支匕首，没想到你们找到它了。佩服！佩服！”
    首都机场的安全门，不愧为真正的安全门。去年一年，他们查出各种凶器、违禁品９９２１件，为国内国际航班的安全提供了重要保障！
