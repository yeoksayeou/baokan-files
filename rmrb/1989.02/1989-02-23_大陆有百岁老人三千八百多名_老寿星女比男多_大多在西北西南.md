	Mainland China Has Over 3,800 Centenarians
	Women Outnumber Men Among the Oldest; Most Live in Western Regions

	BEIJING — As China moves toward becoming an "aged" nation, the mainland currently has 3,851 centenarians, with 2,716 of them being women, accounting for 70 percent of the total.

	Materials provided by the China National Committee on Aging indicate that most centenarians live in rural areas and are primarily distributed in China's western regions. Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has the highest number of centenarians, with 865 individuals, nearly a quarter of the nation's total. In terms of the ratio of centenarians per million people, Xinjiang leads the way, followed by Tibet, Qinghai, and Guangxi. Shanxi Province has the lowest ratio, with only two centenarians per ten million people.

	Among China's ethnic minorities, there are a significant number of centenarians. For every million people, the Han ethnic group has 2.5 centenarians, while ethnic minorities have 22.46. The Uygur ethnic group has 802 centenarians, accounting for half of the ethnic minority centenarians, and the Tibetan ethnic group has 134, ranking second.

	According to investigations by relevant departments in Hubei Province, the main factors contributing to the longevity of centenarians include long-term physical labor, an open and cheerful personality, a harmonious family environment, a family history of longevity, and good eating habits. However, some scholars believe that the significant differences in the ratios of centenarians in different regions and ethnic groups remain a mystery to be solved.

	Many places in China provide special care for centenarians. Shanghai, the only city that has entered the "aged" category, provides high-quality staple foods and side dishes for centenarians; some hospitals in Beijing offer free medical services to centenarians; the Ningbo Municipal Government in Zhejiang Province stipulates that each centenarian can receive a high-age living allowance of 20 yuan per month.

	Beijing experts believe that centenarians are the weak members of society and need special care from their families and society. With the rapid aging of China's population, establishing a health service network for the elderly has become urgent.

　　大陆有百岁老人三千八百多名
    老寿星女比男多　大多在西北西南
    本报讯  记者舒瑜报道：正在向“老年型”国家迈进的我国大陆，目前有百岁老人３８５１名，其中女性２７１６名，占百岁老人总数的７０％。
    中国老龄问题全国委员会提供的材料表明，大陆百岁老人多数居住在农村，主要分布在我国西北和西南。新疆维吾尔自治区百岁老人数量最多，有８６５人，几乎占全国百岁老人的１／４。按百万人中拥有的百岁老人的比率统计，新疆也是遥遥领先，其次是西藏、青海、广西；比率最小的是山西省，每千万人中仅有两名百岁老人。
    我国少数民族中百岁老人较多。每百万人中，汉族百岁老人为２．５人，而少数民族则高达２２．４６人。维吾尔族百岁老人共有８０２人，占少数民族百岁老人的一半；藏族百岁老人１３４人，居第二位。
    据湖北省有关部门调查，百岁老人长寿的主要因素是：长期从事体力劳动，性格豁达开朗，家庭比较和睦，家族有长寿史，饮食习惯良好。但另一些学者认为，百岁老人在不同地区、不同民族中所占比率的悬殊差异，仍是一个尚待解开的谜。
    我国许多地方对百岁老人予以特殊关照。目前唯一跨进“老年型”城市的上海，给百岁老人供给可口的高质量的主粮、副食；北京一些医院，免费为百岁老人看病；浙江省宁波市政府规定，每位百岁老人每月可享受高龄生活补助费２０元。
    北京有关专家认为，百岁老人是社会的弱者，需要家庭和社会的特别照顾。随着我国人口老年化的迅速推进，建立高龄老人的保健服务网络已刻不容缓。
