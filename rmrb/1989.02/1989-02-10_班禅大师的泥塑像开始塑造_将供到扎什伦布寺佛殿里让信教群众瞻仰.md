The clay statue of the Panchen Lama began to be crafted today. After completion, it will be placed in the Buddhist hall of Tashilhunpo Monastery for religious believers to pay their respects.

The deputy director of the Panchen Lama's new palace, Dechen Puncang Management Bureau, Jamyang Qun, told reporters: "The statue of the Panchen Lama is being crafted according to the wishes of the monks and believers. This work will be completed by a senior clay sculptor."

According to Tibetan Buddhist tradition, statues are made for high-ranking monks and living Buddhas who have passed away, so that devout Buddhist disciples can always remember and pray for the living Buddha, and promote Buddhist teachings.

It is understood that the height of the Panchen Lama's clay statue will be slightly taller than an average person.
