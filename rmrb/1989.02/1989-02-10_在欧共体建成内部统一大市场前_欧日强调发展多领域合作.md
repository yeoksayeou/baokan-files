The European Community and Japan agreed on February 3 that over the next four years, before the EC completes its internal single market by the end of 1992, relations between the two will be further strengthened.

The President of the EC Commission, Jacques Delors, Vice-President Frans Andriessen, and Martin Bangemann met with visiting Japanese Minister of International Trade and Industry Takeo Sanjo in Brussels on the same day. Both sides agreed to develop cooperation in multiple areas, balance cooperation and competition, and resolve specific issues more quickly and effectively. They pointed out that this should be the guiding principle for the development of EC-Japan relations.

A spokesperson for the EC Commission said that during the meeting, Chairman Delors emphasized the expansion of EC-Japan cooperation and the strengthening of the triangular relationship between Europe, America, and Japan. He believes that both sides "must go beyond the simple trade category and expand cooperation to the economic, technological, and cultural fields." Delors hopes that Japan, with its strong financial capabilities and increasing influence in the global economy, will take the lead in addressing the global debt crisis. He praised Japan's efforts to stimulate domestic demand and promote more balanced global economic development.

Takeo Sanjo agreed with Delors' proposal to strengthen EC-Japan relations but emphasized the need for "fair and balanced cooperation and competition." He said that Japan is willing to take the lead in addressing the debt issue. He also stated that Japan will continue to work on stimulating domestic demand.

In recent times, Japan has taken and is preparing to take further measures to ease the conditions for European products entering the Japanese market, such as reducing import taxes on large-displacement European cars and eliminating heavy taxes on European alcoholic beverages. The EC expressed satisfaction with this but emphasized that Japan's trade surplus with the EC (calculated in dollars) increased significantly in 1988, demanding that Japan expand imports of European products. Japan, on the other hand, requested that the EC and its member states remove more than 130 "discriminatory" restrictions on important Japanese goods, particularly import restrictions on cars, motorcycles, and color televisions.

　　在欧共体建成内部统一大市场前
　  欧日强调发展多领域合作
    新华社布鲁塞尔电  （记者诸葛仓麟）欧洲共同体和日本２月３日一致认为，在共同体１９９２年底建成内部统一大市场前的４年中，欧日关系将会进一步加强。
    共同体委员会主席雅克·德洛尔、副主席弗朗斯·安德里森、马丁·班格曼３日在布鲁塞尔分别会见了来访的日本通产大臣三塚博。双方同意发展多领域合作，摆好合作与竞争的关系，更快和更为有效地解决可能出现的具体问题，并指出这应该成为发展欧日关系的指导原则。
    共同体委员会发言人说，德洛尔主席在会见时强调扩大欧日合作，加强欧美日三角关系。他认为，欧日双方“必须摆脱单纯贸易范畴，把合作扩大到经济、技术和文化领域”。德洛尔希望拥有强大财政手段、在世界经济中具有日益重大影响的日本，在解决世界债务危机方面发挥带头作用。他对于日本刺激内需，促进世界经济更为平衡发展所作的努力表示赞赏。
    三塚博表示赞成德洛尔提出的加强欧日关系的设想，但强调双方“合作和竞争的公正均衡”。他说，日本愿意在解决债务问题上起带头作用。他还表示，日将努力刺激内需。
    近一个时期，日本已采取并准备继续采取一些措施，放宽欧洲产品进入日本市场的条件，如削减欧洲大容量气缸汽车进口税、取消对欧洲含酒精饮料的重税等。共同体对此表示满意，但强调１９８８年日本对欧贸易顺差（以美元计算）又有较大增长，要求日本扩大进口欧洲产品；日本则要求共同体及其成员国取消对日本重要商品的１３０多项“歧视性”限制，特别是对汽车、摩托车和彩色电视机的进口限制。
