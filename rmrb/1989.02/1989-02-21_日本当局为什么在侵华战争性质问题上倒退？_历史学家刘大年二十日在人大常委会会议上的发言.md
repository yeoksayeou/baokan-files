Title: Why Does the Japanese Government Retreat on the Nature of the War of Aggression Against China?

This issue was raised in the ongoing Japanese Diet, and I believe we also need to discuss it.

From February 14 to February 18, Japanese Prime Minister Takeshita Noboru and the Director of the Cabinet Legislation Bureau repeatedly exonerated Emperor Hirohito from war responsibility and justified Japan's war of aggression against China during a parliamentary inquiry. The Director of the Cabinet Legislation Bureau stated that, whether from domestic law or international law, Emperor Hirohito bore no war responsibility. Takeshita Noboru said, "Whether the last war was an aggression should be evaluated by future historians." When the opposition party pressed further, asking, "Former Prime Minister Nakasone had acknowledged that the last war was an aggression. What is Prime Minister Takeshita's view on this?" Takeshita Noboru replied, "There are various theories about aggressive war. It is difficult to determine which theory to adopt." He then repeated, "Whether the last war was an aggressive war should be evaluated by future historians."

The Japanese government's repeated attempts to justify the war of aggression occur at a time when the world's public opinion is closely watching this issue. The British and New Zealand diplomatic circles have severely condemned the war crimes committed by Japanese militarism. Many voices in South Korea and within Japan itself have also published critical articles. Kyodo News reported that on February 24, there will be anti-imperial gatherings in 100 locations across Japan. The Chinese people endured eight years of arduous national liberation war against Japan, with over 20 million casualties and property losses amounting to approximately $100 billion. It is only natural that we are concerned about this issue.

Regarding whether Emperor Hirohito bears war responsibility, this is not an issue in the eyes of the Chinese people, and thus the academic community rarely discusses it. If one insists that he bears no legal responsibility, this is deceitful and no one will believe it. The records of all the Imperial Conferences and the participants during the entire war period are clear and verifiable. Every crucial moment required a decision from the Imperial Conference. This alone is sufficient to demonstrate the war responsibility.

Regarding the nature of the war and whether it should be evaluated by future historians, I wonder if Mr. Takeshita has a specific timeline or special meaning for the term "future"? Most historians in Japan and around the world have already reached a consensus on the nature of that war. There are countless examples, but I will cite just one: a recently published book in Japan titled "The Sino-Japanese War and Sino-Japanese Relations: Proceedings of the Sino-Japanese Academic Symposium on the 50th Anniversary of the Lugouqiao Incident."

The editors are Kyoto University Emeritus Professor Inoue Tsuyoshi and Tokyo University Emeritus Professor and Asia University President Eto Jun. The book includes nearly 20 essays from scholars on both sides. Most of the essays are from the Japanese side. The symposium was summarized by Professor Toyama Shigeru, a renowned historian in Japan, who said, "This symposium has made the significance of the full-scale war between China and Japan, which began with the Lugouqiao Incident, even clearer. The core of this significance is that Japan launched a full-scale invasion of China. This war ended with China's victory in the national liberation war and Japan's complete defeat. There is no ambiguity about this point in the symposium." He also said, "Recognizing Japan's invasion of China is not just from the Lugouqiao Incident but should go back to 1931 and 1872. From the textbook incident, Japan needs to re-evaluate the nature of that war. Only in this way can we explore the Sino-Japanese relations from 1945 to the present." Japanese newspapers, radio stations, and other media outlets have reported extensively on this symposium. Mr. Takeshita insists that the nature of the war should be evaluated by future historians. The complete proceedings of the Sino-Japanese Academic Symposium on the 50th Anniversary of the Lugouqiao Incident and the summary by a famous Japanese scholar are evaluations of the nature of the war. From a temporal perspective, that war has been over for more than 40 years. Contemporary historians are already its "future" or "near-future." Which "future" are we waiting for to evaluate it? The facts are clear: first, exonerating war responsibility is meaningless and instead shows a lack of courage to face the facts. Second, the war Japan waged against China was a war of aggression by Japanese militarism, and this nature cannot be changed by anyone.

Japanese middle school history textbooks, after repeated struggles, have included the term "aggression" in some cases, changing the previous term "advance." Former Prime Minister Nakasone explicitly acknowledged that the nature of that war was one of aggression. International exchanges require honesty. Sino-Japanese friendship is in the fundamental interests of both peoples. Maintaining and developing Sino-Japanese friendly relations requires planting flowers, not thorns. China is a country of etiquette, and there is a Sino-Japanese Peace and Friendship Treaty between the two countries. The Japanese government has repeatedly stated that Japan's actions during World War II may not be called an aggressive war. Retreating on the issue of the nature of the war, what is this for?

### 日本当局为什么在侵华战争性质问题上倒退？——历史学家刘大年二十日在人大常委会会议上的发言

　　日本当局为什么在侵华战争性质问题上倒退？
    ——历史学家刘大年二十日在人大常委会会议上的发言
    这个问题，是正在举行的日本国会里提出的，我觉得我们也有必要来讲一讲。
    ２月１４日到２月１８日，日本首相竹下登和内阁法制局长在回答在野党质询中，接二连三，为裕仁天皇开脱战争责任，为日本侵略中国的战争辩解。法制局长说，不论从国内法还是从国际法看，裕仁天皇都没有战争责任。竹下登说：“上次大战是不是侵略，应由后世历史学家做评价。”当在野党再一次质询说：“前首相中曾根曾承认上次战争是侵略，竹下首相对此有何见解”时，竹下登回答说：关于侵略战争有多种学说，以哪一种学说为准，难以确定。然后又重复一遍，“上次战争是不是侵略战争，应由后世史学家来评价”。
    日本当局这种一而再，再而三地为侵略战争辩解，是发生在世界舆论密切关注这个问题的时候。英国舆论界和新西兰外交界人士等严厉谴责日本军国主义所犯的战争罪过。南朝鲜、日本国内不少的舆论也发表了批评文章。共同社报道，２月２４日日本将有一百个场所举行反天皇集会。中国人民经历了八年艰苦的抗日民族解放战争，牺牲人数多达２０００万以上，财产损失约１０００亿美元。我们关心这个问题是理所当然的。
    关于裕仁天皇是否负有战争责任，这在中国人看来本来不成其为问题，因此学术界也很少提出来谈论。如果一定要说他在法律上不负任何责任，这是欺人之谈，没有人会信以为真。整个战争期间各次御前会议和当事人的记录，历历可查。每逢关键时刻，总要由御前会议作出决定。单凭这一点，就足以充分说明到底有无战争责任了。
    关于战争的性质是否是侵略战争要由后世历史家来评价的问题，不知竹下先生所说的“后世”有没有特定的界线或特殊含义？日本国内大部分的历史学者以及世界各地的历史家对那场战争的性质早就作出了一致的评价。这样的事实多得无法列举，我只举出日本刚刚出版的一部有份量的书为例。这部书叫做《日中战争与日中关系--卢沟桥事变５０周年日中学术讨论会记录》。
    编著者是京都大学名誉教授井上清、东京大学名誉教授与亚细亚大学校长卫藤沈吉。书里面收入中日双方学者的论文近２０篇。日本方面提供论文的篇数居多。讨论会最后由日本学术界享有声誉的历史家远山茂树教授作总结。他说，“这次讨论会对以七·七事变为开端的中日全面战争的意义更加明确了。这个意义的核心是，日本发动了全面侵华战争。这场战争以中国取得民族解放战争的胜利和日本的彻底失败而告结束。对于这一点，讨论会没有任何的暖昧。”又说：认识日本侵略中国，不是从七·七事变开始，要上溯到１９３１年、１８７２年。“从教科书事件看，日本需要对那场战争的性质进行再认识。只有这样，才有利于探讨从１９４５年至今天的中日关系”。日本的报纸、电台等舆论媒介对这次会议有不少报道。竹下登先生坚持主张对战争的性质要由后世历史学家来评价。卢沟桥事变５０周年中日学术讨论会的全部纪录和日本著名学者所作的讨论总结，就是对战争性质所作的评价。从时间上看，那场战争已经过去４０多年。当代历史家已经是它的后世，或“准后世”了，还要等到哪个“后世”去评价呢？事实是再明显不过的，那就是，第一，开脱战争责任毫无意义，反而表现出提出这种开脱是缺少正视事实的勇气。第二，日本对中国进行的战争是日本军国主义侵略中国的战争，这个性质是谁也改变不了的。
    日本的中学历史教科书，经过反复斗争，有的已经把“侵略”写进去了，改变了原来所谓的“进入”说法。中曾根前首相正式明确认为，那场战争的性质是侵略战争。国际间的交往需要言而有信。中日友好是两国人民的根本利益所在。中日友好关系的维持和发展，需要多栽花，不栽刺。中国是礼仪之邦，中日两国间订有和平友好条约。日本当局接二连三表示，日本在第二次世界大战中的行为未必能说是侵略战争。在战争性质问题上往后倒退，这究竟是为了什么？
