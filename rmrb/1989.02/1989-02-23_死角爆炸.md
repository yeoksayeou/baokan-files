Two hundred years ago, when the French Revolution, the most populous country in Europe at the time, erupted, the news took four years to reach the Qing Dynasty court in China. Today, news of a coup in the small landlocked country of Paraguay in Latin America can spread around the world in a single night. The progress of science and the development of media seem to have made the Earth smaller. More importantly, the current wave of democratization is sweeping the globe, and the politics of various countries are closely interconnected, influencing each other. The world is becoming one, and it is difficult for political blind spots to exist. The coup in Paraguay is another example of the explosion of a political blind spot.

If we were to use the style of unofficial history, we could weave this coup into a story of "in-laws turning into enemies." Because the overthrown Stroessner and the coup leader General Rodriguez are indeed related by marriage. However, stories often tend to be superficial. In fact, under the impact of the democratization trend, the sudden change in Paraguay's political situation is inevitable.

Stroessner came to power through a coup in 1954. Before that, in the fifty-four years, Paraguay had experienced thirty coups and twenty-two presidents in thirty-one years. As the saying goes, in times of chaos, heroes and villains emerge. After Stroessner came to power, he hung the banners of "democracy" and "republic," but in reality, he practiced personal dictatorship. Relying on the support of the military, the Colorado Party, and the police, he manipulated elections to stay in power, winning eight consecutive terms and sitting in the presidential chair for thirty-five years. Yet, he claimed that Paraguay had achieved "perfect democracy." Tragically, his "democracy" was so "perfect" that citizens had no freedom of assembly, association, or speech. It was so "perfect" that anyone who criticized him would be sentenced to six years in prison, and even family gatherings required police permission. According to reports, in the thirty-five years, out of a population of approximately 3.5 million, 1.5 million Paraguayans were forced to flee the country, and 150,000 were imprisoned. Clearly, his so-called "perfect democracy" was a genuine dictatorship.

Paraguay is one of the poorest countries in Latin America. There, smuggling is rampant, accounting for about half of the total foreign trade. Although the external debt is not high, foreign exchange reserves are insufficient to repay the principal and interest due. The government openly admits that foreign exchange reserves may be exhausted in the first half of this year.

Under the tyranny of Paraguay, it is also an international den of iniquity, where all sorts of social dregs gather. Among them are old Nazi war criminals who fled after the war, as well as wanted Italian neo-fascists. Leaders of European drug trafficking gangs come here to rest, and bank robbers from North America and political assassins from Western Europe hide here. The reason is that the politics here are reactionary, the government is corrupt, and money can make the devil grind: a visa costs $200, and a passport costs $700. In the mid-1950s, the executioner of the Auschwitz concentration camp, the Nazi doctor known as the "Angel of Death," Mengele, hid in Paraguay, obtained citizenship, and paid an annual fee to live in this international political blind spot for more than twenty years.

The times are changing, and the world is progressing. In the face of the strong democratic tide, those who go with the flow prosper, and those who go against it perish. Military dictatorships around the world have been one by one either handing over power or falling. Since the late 1970s, Paraguay's neighboring countries, Brazil, Bolivia, Argentina, and Uruguay, have all begun their "democratization process." The struggle of the Paraguayan people against dictatorship and for democracy has intensified and has received strong support from the international community. Under domestic and international pressure, the ruling faction in Paraguay, which was in a predicament, finally split. Even in-laws turned against each other: when the despot Stroessner tried to establish his son's succession and seize Rodriguez's military power, the latter struck first, staged a coup, and expelled the old in-law from the country.

Stroessner's dictatorship finally met its end. Will the new rulers continue down the old path, promoting "Stroessnerism without Stroessner," or will they seize the opportunity, change their tune, and enter the "democratization process"? This remains to be seen. However, the Paraguayan people, who have experienced thirty-five years of authoritarian rule, will not accept a dictatorship in disguise. Therefore, the explosion of this political blind spot in Paraguay may play a certain role in clearing the way for Paraguay to adopt democratic politics.

　　死角爆炸
    马为民
    两百年前，当时欧洲人口最多的国家法国爆发轰轰烈烈的大革命，可消息传到我国清朝朝廷，已是四年之后；而今天，一个拉美内陆小国巴拉圭发生政变的新闻，却能在一夜间传遍世界各个角落。科学的进步和传播媒介的发展仿佛使地球变小了。更重要的是，当前民主化潮流席卷全球，各国政治紧密地相互感应，相互影响，世界在联成一片，很难存在政治死角了。巴拉圭政变就是又一个政治死角的爆炸。
    若采用野史笔法，倒能把这场政变串成一个“亲家反目变冤家”的故事。因为被推翻的斯特罗斯纳和政变领导人罗德里格斯将军确系儿女亲家。不过，故事总难免流于表面。事实上，在民主化潮流冲击下，巴拉圭的政局骤变带有必然性。
    斯特罗斯纳是一九五四年策动政变上台的。在此之前的五十四年当中，巴拉圭发生过三十次政变，三十一年当中换了二十二个总统。常言道，乱世出英雄，也出蟊贼。斯特罗斯纳上台后，挂着“民主”“共和”的招牌，实行个人独裁。他凭借军队、红党和警察的支持，玩弄选举把戏，连选连任，八选八任，一口气坐了三十五年总统交椅。而他却居然说在巴拉圭实现了“完美的民主”。可悲的是，他的“民主”，“完美”到了公民没有集会、结社和言论的自由，“完美”到了谁批评他就要判刑六年，甚至连亲友聚会也须求得警方允许。据报道，三十五年当中，目前人口约三百五十万的巴拉圭有一百五十万人被迫流亡国外，十五万人身陷囹圄。可见，他所谓的“完美的民主”实是道地的专制。
    巴拉圭是拉美最贫穷的国家之一。那里走私贸易十分猖獗，约占外贸总额的一半。外债额虽不算高，但外汇储备已不足以偿还到期的本息。官方公开承认，外汇储备今年上半年将可能耗尽。
    暴政下的巴拉圭还是一个藏垢纳污的国际性黑窝子，各色社会渣滓在这里麋集。其中有战后潜逃的德国老牌纳粹战犯，也有遭通缉的意大利新法西斯分子。欧洲贩毒集团的头目来此歇脚，北美抢劫银行的大盗和西欧的政治刺客在此藏身。原因是，这里政治反动，政权腐败，有钱能叫鬼推磨：签证二百美元一个，护照七百美元一本。当年奥斯威辛集中营中的刽子手、人称“死亡天使”的纳粹医生门格勒，于五十年代中期匿身巴拉圭，买得国籍，年年为此缴费，在这个国际政治的死角里逍遥了二十多年。
    时代在前进，世界在进步。在强劲的民主潮流前面，顺者昌，逆者亡。世界各地的军人独裁政权一个接一个地或交权或倒台。七十年代末开始，巴拉圭的邻国巴西、玻利维亚和阿根廷以及乌拉圭，都先后开始“民主化进程”。巴拉圭人民反独裁、争民主的斗争更加高涨，并得到国际社会的有力声援。在国内外压力下，陷入困境的巴拉圭执政派内部终于发生分化，儿女亲家也闹翻了：当独夫民贼斯特罗斯纳试图立子继位、要夺罗德里格斯的军权时，后者抢先一步，兵变陈桥，把年迈的老亲家逐出了国门。
    斯特罗斯纳的独裁专制终于翻车了。新当权者是重整行装走老路，推行“没有斯特罗斯纳的斯特罗斯纳主义”呢，还是审时度势，改弦易辙，步入“民主化进程”？这尚须观察。不过，经历过三十五年专制统治的巴拉圭人民是不会接受改头换面的独裁制度的。所以，巴拉圭这个政治死角的爆炸，可能对巴拉圭改行民主政治起某种扫路的作用。
