On the afternoon of February 2, Peng Zhen, accompanied by Liang Guangda, Secretary of the Zhuhai Municipal Party Committee and Mayor of Zhuhai City, inspected two of the largest agricultural markets in the Zhuhai Special Economic Zone, Chaoyang Market and Gankou Market. The markets were filled with a variety of vegetables, fruits, and meat, poultry, eggs, and fish. Peng Zhen visited individual stalls and inquired about the prices of various items. Peng Zhen emphasized during his inspection of the agricultural markets that market issues are the first issue concerning people's livelihood, and efforts must be made to address them.

The Gankou Agricultural Market, located near Macau, primarily serves Macau residents, with nearly 20,000 Macau residents crossing the border daily to purchase foodstuffs. When Peng Zhen arrived at the Gankou Market, he happily waved and greeted the Macau residents shopping there, wishing them a happy New Year.
