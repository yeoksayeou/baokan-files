China will vigorously develop nuclear power. By the end of the century, nuclear power plants with a total capacity of 6 million kilowatts will be built.

Beijing, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The current severe shortage of energy, especially electricity, provides a good opportunity for the development of nuclear power in China. Minister of Energy Huang Yiseng revealed at the closing ceremony of the China National Nuclear Corporation's work meeting today that nuclear power will be vigorously developed by the end of the century. By the year 2000, China's nuclear energy development target is 12 million tons of standard coal. Nuclear power plants with a total capacity of 6 million kilowatts will be built, generating 30 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually.

Huang Yiseng emphasized that the development of nuclear power must adhere to the policy of "self-reliance and foreign cooperation." He urged the nuclear industry teams responsible for building nuclear power plants to master the technology, focus on domestic manufacturing, and quickly achieve the localization of 600,000-kilowatt pressurized water reactor nuclear power units. Mass production should be pursued to significantly reduce costs and prices.

Huang Yiseng believes that China's nuclear power construction has had a good start. Currently, efforts should be concentrated on building the Qinshan and Dayawan nuclear power plants.

　　我国将大力发展核电    
    本世纪末建成核电机组六百万千瓦
    本报北京２月１７日讯  记者张何平报道：当前能源尤其是电力紧缺的状况，为我国核电的发展提供了良机。能源部长黄毅诚在今日闭幕的中国核工业总公司工作会议上透露，本世纪末要大力发展核电。到２０００年我国核能的发展目标为０．１２亿吨标准煤。建成核电机组６００万千瓦，年发电量为３００亿度。
    黄毅诚强调，发展核电必须坚持“以我为主，中外合作”方针。他要求承担建设核电站任务的核工业队伍认真掌握技术，立足于自己制造，尽快实现６０万千瓦压水堆核电机组国产化，批量生产，把成本和造价大幅度降下来。
    黄毅诚认为我国核电建设已有了一个良好的开端，当前要集中力量把秦山、大亚湾两个核电站建好。
