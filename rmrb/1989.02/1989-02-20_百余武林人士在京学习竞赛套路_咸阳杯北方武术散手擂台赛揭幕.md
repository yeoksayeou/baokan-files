Over 100 martial arts practitioners from 31 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions are currently in Beijing learning the competition routines for the National Tai Chi Chuan competition.

To meet the domestic and international requirements for standardized martial arts competition routines, the State Sports Commission's Martial Arts Research Institute invited Chinese martial arts experts to revise the Yang, Chen, Sun, and Wu styles of Tai Chi Chuan competition routines, as well as seven international competition routines for saber, spear, sword, staff, long fist, southern fist, and comprehensive Tai Chi Chuan. The first batch of learners includes professors, associate professors, martial arts coaches, senior martial artists, famous athletes, and key personnel from sports associations and martial arts schools; participants also include learners from Tibet and Hainan. The training class is taught by renowned Tai Chi Chuan masters and experts such as Yang Zhenchao, Chen Xiaowang, Li Bingci, Zhang Jixiu, Han Guixiang, Xu Yuru, and Li Chengxiang.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Xian, February 18th - The Xianyang Cup North China Martial Arts Sanshou Invitational Tournament, with 55 participants, opened today in Xianyang, Shaanxi. Unlike routine competitions, Sanshou martial arts competitions feature the use of both hands and feet, are fierce and fast-paced, and have strong practical combat elements. In 1988, Sanshou was officially listed as a competition event by the State Sports Commission.
