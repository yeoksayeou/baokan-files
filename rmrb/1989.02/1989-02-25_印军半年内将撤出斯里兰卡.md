Indian troops will withdraw from Sri Lanka within the next six months, according to Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Ranjan Wijeratne. He emphasized that the withdrawal should not be too hasty, especially from the northern and eastern regions.

Wijeratne told reporters that once the North-East Provincial Council, elected according to the constitution, can maintain law and order in the region, Indian troops can immediately withdraw.

He said the Indian government has expressed its willingness to withdraw all its troops and has assured President Premadasa of this. Three battalions of Indian troops have already withdrawn from Sri Lanka in accordance with the ruling party's election manifesto. He pointed out that Indian troops entered Sri Lanka under the 1981 Indo-Sri Lanka Peace Accord and cannot withdraw while militant Tamil armed groups remain active in the north and east, fighting for an independent "Eelam."

Regarding Sri Lanka's proposal to replace the Indo-Sri Lanka Peace Accord with a Sri Lanka-India Friendship Treaty, the Foreign Minister said India has accepted the proposal and Sri Lanka will begin drafting the treaty.

　　印军半年内将撤出斯里兰卡
    新华社科伦坡２月２３日电  斯里兰卡外交部长兰扬·维杰拉特内今天强调，印度军队不能从北部和东部地区撤得太快。全部印度军队将在今后６个月内分阶段撤完。
    维杰拉特内对记者说，一旦按宪法选举产生的北方—东方省委员会能够维持该地区的法律与秩序，印度军队即可立即撤离。
    他说，印度政府已表示愿意全部撤军，并向普雷马达萨总统作了保证。已有３个营的印军根据执政党竞选声明撤离斯里兰卡。他指出，印度军队是根据１９８１年斯印和平协议进驻的，在激进的泰米尔武装分子仍然活跃在北部和东部地区时，印度军队不能撤出。泰米尔武装分子一直在上述地区，为成立一个独立的“伊拉姆”国而进行军事斗争。
    在谈到斯里兰卡建议用斯印友好条约来代替斯印和平协议时，这位外长说，印度已表示接受建议，斯里兰卡将着手起草条约。
