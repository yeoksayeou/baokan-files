	Establish Investment Benefit and Management Concepts
	Raw Material Industry Construction Projects Not All Protected
	State Raw Material Investment Company Suspends 22 Projects in First Batch

	BEIJING, Feb. 10 (Xinhua) — Reporter Lü Mù — The raw material industry is a weak link in China's national economy and urgently needs development. Generally, people think that all fixed asset investment projects in this sector are "protected." However, the State Raw Material Investment Company has established investment benefit and management concepts. The preliminary investigation of 279 ongoing construction projects (including 99 large and medium-sized ones) shows that there are quite a few that can and should be reduced, and it is necessary to seriously clean them up. In the first batch, 22 projects and individual engineering items have been decided to be suspended, reducing investment by 14.2 million yuan.

	The Maosteel supporting project, Shandong Refractory Materials Factory Maosteel Sand Project, with an investment estimate of 28 million yuan, has already spent 4.5 million yuan. However, after recalculating, it was found that the production cost is high, the product selling price is low, the economic benefit is not ideal, and the investment recovery is not guaranteed. Therefore, it was decided to suspend and rework the construction plan.

	If the production process is not up to standard or needs to be changed, it will directly affect the investment benefit and recovery. The Xunyang Hydrated Silica Processing Factory Hydrated Silica Refining Powder Project is a scientific research and development topic. With an investment of 40 million yuan, 1/4 has already been spent. However, due to the immaturity of the process, the processed products do not meet the standards, so it was decided to suspend.

	In the previous cleanup, it was also found that projects such as the Chongqing Organic Chemical Factory's 3,000-ton ethylene and subsequent processing, using grain alcohol as raw material; the Jingmen Refining Plant's 20,000-ton methyl tert-butyl ether unit, with insufficient supply of raw material methanol, high cost, and poor benefit; the Shanghai Glass Machinery Factory's float glass cold-end machinery nationalization project "hitching a ride" on the aluminum alloy door and window processing production line; and some key projects with many buildings and halls. For these problems, the State Raw Material Investment Company and the relevant competent departments have also made corresponding suspensions according to the relevant policies of the State Council.

　　树立投资效益观念和经营观念    
    原材料工业在建项目并非都保    
    国家原材料投资公司首批停缓建２２个项目
    本报北京２月１０日讯  记者鲁牧报道：原材料工业是我国国民经济中的薄弱环节，急需发展。这方面的固定资产投资项目，一般人们都以为全属“保”的。但是，国家原材料投资公司树立投资效益观念和经营观念，对正在建设的２７９个经营性基建项目（其中大中型９９个）初步清查结果表明，可压该压的可说不少，也有认真清理的必要。仅第一批决定停缓建的项目和单项工程就有２２个，压缩投资１．４２亿元。
    宝钢配套项目山东耐火材料厂莫来石砂工程，投资概算２８００万元，已花４５万元，但经再次测算，发现生产成本高，产品售价低，经济效益不理想，投资回收无保证，因此决定停缓，重搞建设方案。
    生产工艺不过关或须改变，直接影响投资的效益和回收。浏阳海泡石加工厂海泡石精选粉工程，系科研开发课题。投资４００万元，已花１／４，但鉴于工艺不成熟，加工不出合格产品，决定停缓。
    在前一段清理中，也还发现诸如重庆有机化工厂３０００吨乙烯及后加工，采用粮食酒精作原材料；荆门炼油厂２万吨甲基叔丁醛醚装置，生产原料甲醇供应不足，成本高、效益差；上海玻璃机械厂浮法玻璃冷端机械国产化项目“搭车”上了铝合金门窗加工生产线；还有一些重点工程上了不少楼堂馆所等等。对这些问题，国家原材料投资公司和有关主管部门按照国务院有关政策规定，也分别作了停缓处理。
