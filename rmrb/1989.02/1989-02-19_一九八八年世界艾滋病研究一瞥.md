By October 1, 1988, the number of AIDS patients worldwide had reached 120,000, with 139 countries and regions reporting cases. Additionally, between 500,000 to 1,000,000 people had already been infected with the AIDS virus.

Many countries are researching drugs and vaccines to treat AIDS. The United States is using drugs such as azidothymidine (AZT), soluble inorganic compounds like polyoxotungstate, and ribavirin. American researchers have also used computers to simulate and isolate human protein T. They found that even low concentrations of protein T and its derivatives can prevent the AIDS virus from invading normal cells. The United States has successfully extracted the env gene from the AIDS virus and inserted it into the cowpox virus. Mice and monkeys injected with this cowpox virus produced antibodies against the AIDS virus.

Japan discovered that glycyrrhizin enhances the immune function of AIDS-infected individuals and stops the progression of the disease. Additionally, a powder extracted from the cones of pine trees has been found to inhibit the replication of the AIDS virus; a substance called LEM extracted from mushrooms inhibits the AIDS virus from invading lymphocytes; and sulfated polysaccharides have a 90% to 98% inhibitory effect on the AIDS virus and cancer cells, whereas AZT has only a 70% inhibitory effect.

The HPA-23 antimony-tungsten compound developed by the Pasteur Institute in France is considered effective against AIDS. It can prevent the AIDS virus from replicating within the body and has no toxic effects on cells.

M·M1, developed by doctors from Zaire and Egypt, is a drug that can restore immune system function without toxicity.

China has achieved good results in treating AIDS using the traditional Chinese medicine AIDS-1.

However, as of now, there are no drugs that can cure AIDS, and a vaccine to prevent AIDS is at least five years away from being available.

　　一九八八年世界艾滋病研究一瞥
    到一九八八年十月一日，全世界艾滋病患者已达十二万人，全世界报病国家和地区共计一百三十九个。另外还有五百至一千万人已传染上艾滋病毒。
    不少国家都在研究治疗艾滋病的药物和疫苗。美国采用的药物有叠氮胸腺啶（即ＡＺＴ）、可溶性无机化合物多酸钨硅酸盐、里巴维宁等。美国研究人员还用计算机模拟分离出人体蛋白质Ｔ。他们发现浓度很低的蛋白质Ｔ及其衍生物都能阻止艾滋病毒侵袭正常细胞。美国已经成功地把艾滋病毒的ｅｎｖ基因从病毒中取出，插入牛痘病毒，注射该牛痘病毒的小鼠和猴产生了对艾滋病病毒的抗体。
    日本发现甘草甜素具有增强艾滋病感染者的免疫能力和制止病情发展的作用。另外，从针叶松的松塔中提取的粉末物质具有抑制艾滋病繁殖的作用；从蘑菇的菌体中提取的ＬＥＭ物质具有抑制艾滋病毒侵袭淋巴细胞作用；硫酸化多糖类对艾滋病病毒和癌细胞的抑制效果可达百分之九十至百分之九十八，而ＡＺＴ抑制效果仅为百分之七十。
    法国巴斯德研究所研制的ＨＰＡ—２３锑钨合剂被认为对艾滋病有效。它可以防止艾滋病毒在体内增殖而对细胞无毒性作用。
    由扎伊尔和埃及医生研制的Ｍ·Ｍ１是一种能够恢复免疫系统功能而无毒性的药物。
    我国用中草药艾滋—１号来治疗艾滋病研究获得较好的效果。
    但至今能治愈艾滋病的药品尚未出现，能预防艾滋病的疫苗至少还要五年才能推出。　　　　（一九八八年十二月二十八日《今晚报》刘祖义　刘宏文）
