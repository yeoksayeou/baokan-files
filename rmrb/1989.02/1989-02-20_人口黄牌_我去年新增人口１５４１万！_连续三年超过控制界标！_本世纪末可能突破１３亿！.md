    Population Warning
    Last year, China's population increased by 15.41 million!
    For three consecutive years, the population growth has exceeded the control limit!
    By the end of the century, the population may exceed 1.3 billion!

    According to the New China News Agency, Beijing, February 19th, (reporter Xu Yaozhong) The State Statistical Bureau revealed that by the end of last year, the total population of the country reached 1,096,140,000, an increase of 15.41 million from the previous year. Economists say that an annual increase of this magnitude is equivalent to issuing a bright yellow card to China's economic and social development!

    An increase of 15.41 million people means that every minute, 29 people are added to the population, every day 42,104 people are added, and in a year, the population increases by the equivalent of the entire population of Australia. This astonishing figure of new population growth has brought tremendous pressure to economic and social development: if each person consumes 200 kilograms of grain, then an additional 30 billion kilograms of grain will be consumed in a year, while last year China's grain production actually decreased; if each person consumes 2 meters of cloth, then the country will consume an additional 30 million meters of cloth, accounting for about 40% of the new cloth produced in the country; and if each person occupies 4 square meters of housing, then an additional 60 million square meters of housing will be needed, approximately equal to 30% of the new urban housing built last year. According to relevant departments, the annual increase in population will consume about 20% of the new national income. This means that out of the 200 billion yuan of new national income last year, 40 billion yuan was consumed by the new population.

    Rapid population growth not only offsets a significant portion of the new achievements in economic and social development but also directly affects the improvement of people's lives and the realization of national goals. By the end of the century, China's per capita GDP should reach 800 to 1,000 US dollars, and per capita grain availability should be over 400 kilograms, with people's lives reaching a moderately prosperous level. However, these goals are all based on the premise that the total population of the country does not exceed 1.2 billion by the end of the century.

    According to statistics from relevant departments, since 1986, China's birth rate has exceeded 20‰ for three consecutive years, and the natural growth rate has exceeded 14‰, with an average annual increase of over 15 million people. This not only exceeds the state's annual population control limit but also is higher than the average growth rate during the "Sixth Five-Year Plan" period. If this trend continues, by the end of the century, the total population of the country will exceed 1.3 billion!

    Firmly defending the line that the population should not exceed 1.2 billion by the end of the century has become an urgent strategic task. The yellow card warning of an annual increase of 15.41 million people reminds us: we must not be complacent about the rapid population growth!

　　人口黄牌
    我去年新增人口１５４１万！
    连续三年超过控制界标！
    本世纪末可能突破１３亿！
    据新华社北京２月１９日电  （记者徐耀中）据国家统计局透露，到去年底全国人口总数达１０９６１４万人，比上年末增加了１５４１万人。经济界人士称，一年增加这么多人口，无异于对我国经济和社会发展亮出了一张耀眼的黄牌！
    一年新增１５４１万人，也就是说在大陆这块土地上，每分钟增加２９人，每天增加４２１０４人，一年等于增加了一个澳大利亚全国的人口。这个惊人的新增人口数字给经济和社会发展带来了巨大压力：以每人消费２００公斤粮食计算，一年就要多消费粮食３０多亿公斤，而去年我国的粮食还是减产的；每人消费布仅算它２米的话，全国多消费的布就达３０００多万米，约占全国新增布的４０％；而每人占用４平方米住宅，又要多建住房６０００多万平方米，约等于去年新建城镇住房面积的３０％。据有关部门测算，每年的新增人口将消费掉２０％左右的新增国民收入。这也就是说，在去年我国新增国民收入２０００多亿元中有４００亿元被新增人口消费掉了。
    人口的过快增长不仅抵消了经济和社会发展的相当一部分新成果，还直接影响人民生活的改善和国家奋斗目标的实现。到本世纪末，我国人均国民生产总值要达到８００至１０００美元，人均占有粮食４００多公斤，人民生活达到小康水平。但是这些都是以到本世纪末全国人口总数不超过１２亿为基础的。
    据有关部门统计，从１９８６年起连续三年，我国人口出生率超过２０‰，自然增长率超过１４‰，平均每年都超过１５００万人。这不仅越过了国家年度人口控制的界标，而且高出“六五”期间的平均增长。如果照此速度继续发展下去，到本世纪末，全国人口将突破１３个亿！
    坚决守住到本世纪末人口不超过１２亿的大堤，已成为最紧迫的战略任务。一年增加１５４１万人口的黄牌警告在提醒人们：决不能对人口猛增掉以轻心！
