The day the last Soviet soldier withdrew from Afghanistan was also the day the Soviet Foreign Minister returned to the Middle East after approximately 15 years. This is perhaps not a coincidence. The situation in the Middle East is undergoing significant changes, and the direction of the Soviet Union's Middle East policy after Afghanistan has drawn attention.

On February 17, Foreign Minister Shevardnadze began a 10-day visit to the Middle East, meeting with high-level officials in Syria, Jordan, Egypt, Iraq, and Iran. During his stay in Cairo, he also held separate talks with Israeli Foreign Minister Arens and PLO Executive Committee Chairman Arafat. According to reports, although the Soviet Foreign Minister's visit did not achieve any "breakthrough" diplomatic results, he did make progress in clarifying the Soviet Union's Middle East policy, understanding the bottom line of various parties in the Middle East conflicts, mediating relations among Arab countries, and promoting Middle East peace talks.

The Soviet Union's adjustment of its Middle East policy under the guidance of the "new thinking" policy is not new. In this important diplomatic action with a broad scope of contact, the Soviet Foreign Minister more clearly demonstrated the Soviet Union's intentions in the Middle East. Summarized, there are approximately three aspects:

	— Taking advantage of the opportunity to shed the heavy burden of Afghanistan, the Soviet Union aims to improve relations with Middle Eastern countries, use the Middle East peace conference as a chance to establish its voice in Middle East affairs.
	— Changing the rigid Middle East diplomatic stance of the past 30 years, moving from a "one-sided" position to a "central" position, gradually establishing a new image as a "mediator." The theoretical basis is the shift from "strategic balance" to "balance of interests." The characteristic is that it criticizes Israel's stubborn stance while also building a dialogue bridge; it does not relax its close ties with countries like Syria, but also breaks the taboo of rejecting "separate peace," restoring good relations with moderate countries like Egypt.
	— Competing with the United States for diplomatic initiative in the Middle East, raising the banner of "no Middle East peace talks without the Soviet Union." The overall easing of Soviet-American relations determines that the two countries will not directly confront each other in the Middle East. However, the Soviet Union is also unwilling to see the Middle East affairs dominated by the United States alone, unwilling to accept a "supporting role."

The increasingly flexible Soviet multi-directional Middle East policy has a positive effect on promoting the early resolution of difficult issues in the Middle East. As one of the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, the Soviet Union set the preparatory period for the Middle East peace conference at 6 to 9 months, which undoubtedly won the welcome of the PLO and Arab countries. Shevardnadze also publicly stated the need to consider Israel's interests, gaining cautious satisfaction from Israel. There are reports that Israel's consular representative team in the Soviet Union will be upgraded to a permanent institution. From this, one can easily connect it to Shultz's four Middle East visits last year. The two countries' successive imitation of the "straddling two boats" strategy objectively increases the possibility of Middle East peace talks.

The Soviet Union basically sits on the Arab side, while also seeking a "central position," encouraging moderate tendencies on both the Arab and Israeli sides, and excluding extremist forces, bringing a turning point to the Soviet Union's Middle East policy. During this visit, Shevardnadze mediated relations between Syria and Iraq, Syria and Egypt, and even intended to bring together countries like Egypt, Jordan, Syria, the PLO, and Lebanon on the Arab side, inviting their heads of state to visit Moscow. This is the prelude to the next diplomatic action. The United States has already opened a dialogue channel with the PLO, and Western Europe is in parallel dialogue with both the Arabs and Israelis. Once the Soviet Union establishes a broad friendly relationship with the Arab world and also talks to Israel, the Soviet Union's entire Middle East strategy will come to life. This means what to the United States, the White House naturally knows best.

As Shevardnadze's Middle East visit is about to end, U.S. President Bush met with Egyptian President Mubarak and Jordanian King Hussein in Tokyo. American public opinion is urgently calling on Bush to formulate an effective Middle East policy with an "open mind" and "no predetermined outcome." It seems that the future changes in the Middle East situation will not only depend on how much the Israeli government's stance will "soften," but also on the results of the dialogue between the Soviet Union and the United States.

　　苏联当前中东政策走向
    ——谢瓦尔德纳泽中东行浅析
    本报记者  林皎明
    苏联最后一名士兵撤离阿富汗之日，也是苏联外长相隔约１５年重返中东之时，这恐怕不是历史偶合。中东时局正在出现重大转机，阿富汗之后的苏联中东政策走向如何引起关注。
    谢瓦尔德纳泽外长２月１７日从叙利亚开始为期１０天的中东之行，依次在叙利亚、约旦、埃及、伊拉克和伊朗５国与政府高级官员会晤。在开罗期间，他还与以色列外长阿伦斯和巴解组织执委会主席阿拉法特分别会谈。据报道，苏联外长此行虽未取得“突破性”外交成果，但他在阐明苏联中东政策、了解中东争端各方底牌、调解阿拉伯国家相互关系、推动中东和谈诸方面，还是有收获的。
    苏联在“新思维”方针指导下调整中东政策并非始于今日。苏联外长在这次接触面甚广的重要外交行动中，更加明确地展现出苏联在中东的意图。概括起来，大约有３方面：
    ——乘苏联甩掉阿富汗这个沉重包袱的有利时机，改善与中东国家的关系，以推动中东和会为契机，确立苏联对中东事务的发言权。
    ——一改以往３０年的僵硬中东外交姿态，由“一头沉”向“居中位置”移动，逐渐树立起“中间调解人”的新形象。其理论依据是从“战略均衡”到“利益均衡”的转变。特点是，既批评以色列的顽固立场，又与之架设对话桥梁；既不松懈与叙利亚等国联系紧密的已有基础，又破除排斥“单独媾和”的戒律，与埃及等温和国家重修旧好。
    ——与美国争夺中东的外交主动权，打出“没有苏联就没有中东和谈”的旗帜。苏美关系缓和的总态势决定了两家不至于在中东发生正面冲突，但是，苏联也绝不甘心看着中东事务由美国一家独揽，不接受“配角地位”。
    日渐灵活的苏多方位中东政策对促进中东棘手难题的早日解决，是有推动作用的。作为联合国安理会常任理事国之一，苏联把中东和会筹备期限定在６至９个月，无疑赢得巴解组织和阿拉伯国家的欢迎。谢瓦尔德纳泽外长也公开表明要照顾以色列的利益，得到以色列审慎的满意。有消息披露，以色列在苏联的领事代表团将升格为常设机构。由此，人们很容易连想到舒尔茨去年４次中东之行的言行。苏美两国先后效法“脚踩两只船”的雷同策略，客观上增大中东和谈的可能性。
    苏联基本上坐在阿拉伯一方，同时争取“居中地位”，鼓励阿以双方的温和倾向，排挤极端势力，给苏联的中东政策带来转机。谢瓦尔德纳泽此行中调解巴叙、叙伊、埃叙关系，甚至有意把阿拉伯一方的埃、约、叙、巴、黎等国拧合在一起，邀请其国家元首访问莫斯科，正是下一步外交行动的伏笔。美国已经打开与巴解对话的通道，西欧在阿以两边平行对话。苏联一旦与阿拉伯世界建立广泛友好的关系，又与以色列搭上话，苏联在中东的整盘棋就走活了。这对美国来说意味着什么，白宫自然最清楚。
    谢瓦尔德纳泽外长行将结束中东之行时，美国总统布什在东京会见埃及总统穆巴拉克和约旦国王侯赛因。美国舆论着急地催促布什以“开放的思想”制定“不限定结局”的有效中东政策。看来，今后的中东局势改观，除了要看以色列政府的立场有多大“软化”，还要看苏美两国对话的结果。
