This shocking case occurred in a mountain village in Qinglong County, Guizhou!

On June 18, 1988 (the Dragon Boat Festival), Yang Zhongfu, a young farmer from Zhangwu Village, Tuanzhou District, Zunyi County, was invited to a friend's home in Angu Township near the Qinglong Antimony Mine to celebrate the festival. He arrived at a place about one li from Saojiaoyu Village and saw a horse eating corn seedlings by the roadside. There was no one nearby, and in the distance, a village was visible amidst the surrounding mountains. Yang Zhongfu led the horse out of the cornfield and headed towards the village. To rest, he mounted the horse again.

As soon as he reached the village entrance, he heard someone behind him shouting, "My horse has been stolen and ridden away! Quick, stop him!"

The horse's owner was Li Xueyuan from Saojiaoyu Village. His sons, Li Kaifu and Li Kaipu, rushed out of their house and blocked the road. Seeing this, Yang Zhongfu immediately dismounted. As soon as his feet touched the ground, Li Kaifu grabbed him. Li Kaifu, who had served three years in the army, raised the sickle in his hand and struck Yang Zhongfu with the back of the blade. Yang Zhongfu tried to defend himself with his hands while urgently explaining, "If I were stealing the horse, why would I lead it into the village?"

To verify Yang Zhongfu's statement, Li Kaipu suggested that Yang take them to see if the horse had indeed eaten the corn seedlings. Yang Zhongfu complied immediately. Sure enough, the corn in Xiang Shunjiang's field had been eaten by the horse. However, Xiang Shunjiang insisted that Yang had deliberately led the horse to eat the corn.

At this point, Li Xueyuan grabbed Yang Zhongfu and cursed, "You little thief, you want my horse, I want your life!" He raised the sickle to strike, but was stopped by his son Li Kaipu, who suggested taking Yang to the security office of the 303 Antimony Mine for processing.

Seeing his son Li Kaipu intervene, Li Xueyuan ordered, "Tie him up!" Immediately, Li Kaifu tightly bound Yang Zhongfu with a palm fiber rope. Amidst the curses of dozens of villagers, Yang Zhongfu was taken towards the antimony mine.

When they reached a point about 1.5 kilometers from Saojiaoyu Village, Li Xueyuan suddenly shouted, "We won't take him to the security office! Today, I must kill him!" Xiang Dacai, who was also escorting Yang, loudly asked, "Who agrees to take him to the security office? Raise your hand!" No one raised their hand. Li Xueyuan and Xiang Dacai then shouted, "Who agrees to kill him? Raise your hand! We have had many cattle and horses stolen in the past. Anyone who doesn't agree is a thief's accomplice." As soon as Li and Xiang finished speaking, more than 50 adults and children present all raised their hands. With the raising of these dozens of lawless hands, Li Xueyuan's eyes turned red. He grabbed Yang Zhongfu's ear with his left hand and, with his right hand, swung the sickle down onto Yang Zhongfu's neck!

"Old man..." Seeing Li Xueyuan raise the sickle, Yang Zhongfu cried out. But before he could finish, blood was already gushing from his neck. His body fell to the ground. Li Xueyuan then hacked several more times, severing Yang's trachea and esophagus. Then, Li Kaifu and Xiang Dacai threw the body into a pit about 10 meters deep by the roadside.

Among these more than 50 hands, there were those of demobilized soldiers, illiterate villagers, students, and even children as young as a few years old.

On July 2, 1988, the Qinglong County Public Security Bureau received a report from the Qinglong Antimony Mine Police Station. The Public Security Bureau immediately took action. Based on information provided by a child, the criminal investigation team found Yang Zhongfu, whose body had already decomposed and whose hands were tied behind his back. Li Xueyuan, Li Kaifu, and Xiang Dacai were arrested for the crime of intentional homicide.

Unfortunately, after the bloody incident, the villagers of Saojiaoyu Village still do not know what laws exist in our country or why their actions were illegal. However, the law is unyielding. The main culprits of the bloody incident will face severe legal punishment.

　　五十多法盲举手　杨忠福人头落地    
    血案在表决中酿成
    王国友　丁千
    这个令人震惊的惨案，发生在贵州晴隆县的一个山村！
    １９８８年６月１８日（端午节）这天，遵义县团溪区张五村青年农民杨忠福应邀去晴隆锑矿厂附近安谷乡一朋友家过端午节。他来到距洒焦雨村约一华里的地方，见一匹马在路旁吃包谷苗。近处没有人，前方四面环山的一片平地之中有座村落。杨忠福上前将马牵出包谷地，向着寨子走去。为了歇脚，他又骑上了马背。
    刚到村口，便听得身后突然有人大喊：“我的马被人骑跑了，快把他拦住。”
    马的主人是洒焦雨村村民黎学元。他的儿子黎开富、黎开普听到喊声，冲出家门堵住公路。杨忠福见状旋即跳下马背。脚刚落地，便被黎开富一把抓住。曾在部队当过３年兵的黎开富又举起手中镰刀，以刀背猛击杨忠福。杨忠福一边以手挡刀，一边急切分辩：“要是想偷马，我还牵到寨子里干嘛？”
    为了证实杨忠福是否说谎，黎开普提出要杨带他去看看马是不是真的吃了包谷苗。杨忠福立即照办。果然，村民向顺江家地里的包谷刚被马吃过。然而，一起跟来的向顺江却一口咬定是杨忠福故意拉马去吃的。
    这时，黎学元揪住杨忠福大骂：“小私儿，你要我的马，我要你的命！”并且举起镰刀欲砍，被其子黎开普制止，并建议把杨忠福送３０３锑矿保卫科处理。
    黎学元见儿子黎开普劝阻，便喝令“你们给我把他捆起来！”随即，其子黎开富用一根棕绳狠命将杨忠福捆住，在全村大小数十名村民的唾骂声中，杨忠福被押往锑矿方向而去。
    当走到距洒焦雨村约１．５公里的地方时，黎学元突然大喊：“不送保卫科了，老子今天非把他宰了不可！”一同押送杨忠福的村民向大才大声喝问：“同意送保卫科的举手？”村民们无一举手。黎学元、向大才又喊道：“同意杀掉的举手？我们过去被偷的牛马很多，哪个不同意，那家就是窝贼。”黎、向两人的话音刚落，同去的大人小孩５０多人一齐举手。随着这几十只法盲之手的举起，黎学元两眼充血，左手揪住杨忠福的耳朵，右手举起镰刀，对着杨忠福脖颈猛地劈了下去！
    “老人家……”，见黎学元举起镰刀，杨忠福突然喊了一句。可话未说完，血已经从脖颈喷涌而出。身躯随之倒地。接着黎学元又挥刀连砍几下，将杨的气管、食管割断，然后由黎开富和向大才将尸体抛入路旁１０米深的洞内。
    这５０多只手中，有退伍军人的手，有文盲村民的手，有在校学生的手，也有年仅几岁小孩的手。
    １９８８年７月２日，晴隆县公安局接到晴隆锑矿厂派出所的电话举报，晴隆县公安局立即行动，根据一小孩提供的情况，刑侦队员找到了已经腐烂、双手反捆的杨忠福。黎学元、黎开富、向大才因故意杀人罪被依法逮捕。
    令人遗憾的是，血案发生之后，洒焦雨村村民至今不知道我国有什么法，为什么他们的行为是违法的？但是，法律是无情的。血案的主犯将受到法律的严厉制裁。
