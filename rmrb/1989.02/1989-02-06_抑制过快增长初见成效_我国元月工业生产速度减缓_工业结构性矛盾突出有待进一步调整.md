	Efforts to Control Rapid Growth Show Initial Success
	China's January Industrial Production Slows
	Structural Contradictions in Industry Prominent, Further Adjustments Needed

	BEIJING, Feb. 5 (Xinhua) -- A document released by the State Statistical Bureau today reveals that in January this year, the national total industrial output value was 9.74 billion yuan, an 8.2% increase over the same period last year, but a 10.9% decrease compared to December last year. This figure indicates that China's efforts to control the rapid growth of industrial production have shown initial success.

	However, some problems reflected in the development and changes of the industrial structure cannot be ignored:

	The rapid growth of township and village enterprises has not been effectively controlled, leading to a noticeable decline in the growth of state-owned enterprises, which should be given priority, thus exacerbating structural contradictions.

	In the light industry sector, products such as color televisions, household refrigerators, and washing machines continued to show rapid growth. However, general daily-use industrial products saw varying degrees of reduction, with yarn production decreasing by 17%, textiles by 24%, and daily-use aluminum products by 22.1%.

	In the heavy industry sector, most energy and raw material products saw reductions. The total energy production decreased by 0.1%, crude oil by 1.1%, natural gas by 3.2%, and coal and electricity generation increased by only 0.4% and 0.1% respectively. The production of most metal raw materials declined, with pig iron down by 8.8%, steel by 9.8%, and chemical raw materials such as soda ash, caustic soda, and calcium carbide also seeing reductions. The insufficient production of these basic industrial products will become a constraint on industrial production in the next cycle.

	Experts believe that in the future, more attention should be paid to adjusting the industrial structure. Given the increasingly severe reality of resource constraints, it is necessary to optimize resource allocation on a macro level, firmly control township and village enterprises, and protect state-owned enterprises; control high-input low-output industries, and promote high-efficiency industries. In terms of structure, it is essential to focus on the production of high-end consumer goods while also ensuring the production of basic daily-use industrial products to stabilize the market. Through further deepening reforms, truly revitalize large and medium-sized enterprises and tap into their strong production potential.

### 抑制过快增长初见成效　我国元月工业生产速度减缓　工业结构性矛盾突出有待进一步调整

　　抑制过快增长初见成效
　　我国元月工业生产速度减缓
    工业结构性矛盾突出有待进一步调整
    本报北京２月５日讯  记者张国荣报道：国家统计局今天提供的一份材料透露，今年１月份，全国工业总产值９７４亿元，比去年同期增长８．２％，比去年１２月下降１０．９％。这个数字表明，我国抑制工业生产增长过快的努力已初见成效。
    从工业结构发展变化中所反映出一些问题却不容忽视：
    乡办工业高速增长仍未得到有效控制，使得应当优先保障的全民所有制工业增长出现了明显的滑坡，结构性矛盾进一步突出了。
    在轻工业中，彩色电视机、家用电冰箱、洗衣机等日用电子、电器产品继续保持较快增长，但一般日用工业品却有不同程度的减产，其中纱减产１７％，纺织品减产２４％，日用精铝制品减产２２．１％。
    在重工业中，能源和原材料多数产品减产，能源生产总量减产０．１％，原油减产１．１％，天然气减产３．２％，原煤和发电量仅增长０．４％和０．１％。绝大部分金属原材料生产下降，其中生铁下降８．８％，钢下降９．８％，纯碱、烧碱、电石等化工原料也都减产。这些基础工业产品生产不足，又将成为下一周期工业生产的制约因素。
    有关人士分析认为，今后，要更加注重对工业结构的调整，针对当前资源紧张不断加剧的现实，从总体上，必须进一步强调优化资源配置，坚决压乡办工业，保全民工业；压高投入低产出工业，保高效益工业。从结构上，既要抓紧俏高档消费品的生产，更要下力量组织好基本日用工业品的生产，确保市场稳定；通过进一步深化改革，真正搞活大中型企业，发掘其强大的生产潜力。
