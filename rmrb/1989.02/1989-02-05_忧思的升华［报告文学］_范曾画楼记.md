At 11:30 AM on October 18, 1988, by the shore of Ma Shui Lake at Nankai University. A square piece of marble, half buried in the ground and half exposed, reads:

    Foundation Stone of the Eastern Art Building, Nankai University

Some attentive individuals noticed that compared to the usual name, the word "Great" before "Eastern Art Building" was conspicuously missing. Was this an oversight by the writer, or was it intentionally omitted?

Indeed, this building that is about to rise is only 4,000 square meters, with a total investment of 3.5 million yuan. Does it deserve the title "Great"? Some people say that China is like a vast construction site, and on this site, projects often cost tens of millions. What is this compared to?

However, for him, a painter with nothing but a few brushes, this 4,000 square meters and 3.5 million yuan are an overwhelmingly large sum. For this, he painted for 3 years!

But why did this usually meticulous painter and calligrapher omit the word "Great" when writing the inscription on the foundation stone?

I asked Fan Zeng. Fan Zeng replied with an unusual reverence, "Shakyamuni Buddha said: A drop of water, if it does not wish to dry up, should go to the sea. Today, when I truly pour this drop of soul into the sea, I suddenly realize its insignificance, its meagerness. How dare I arrogantly call it 'Great'?"

Perhaps no one will ever see that foundation stone with the omitted "Great" again. As a witness, I feel it is my duty to record everything buried underground—because it contains many things that are urgently needed and yet precisely lacking on the surface!

    The Dream of Eastern Art

    1986, New York.

    How tall the building is! The elevator broke down several times before reaching the top floor: the 107th floor. This is the highest man-made peak in the world—the World Trade Center. From this cloud-topped height, one can overlook the entire panorama of Manhattan, seeing skyscrapers like a forest and the bustling streets, the city of gold in all its human splendor.

    "Mr. Fan, how do you feel?" an American friend with blond hair and blue eyes asked, not without a hint of boasting.

    Fan Zeng did not speak, only nodded slightly. The Western sense of dominance, that arrogance of ruling the world, made him feel oppressed, his soul trembling. He remembered the exquisite artworks he had seen a few days earlier at the Washington Museum. He was amazed and admired, but also felt indignant: a painting by Rembrandt could sell for enough to build a Chinese art museum, and America had a museum that housed more than a dozen of them; a work by Van Gogh could be auctioned for $55 million here, while the works of Chinese art master Qi Baishi sometimes sold for only a few thousand dollars—was this fair? The talent, intelligence, and superb artistic skills of Chinese artists are recognized worldwide; the traditional art forms, expression methods, and charm of Eastern art have captivated many Western art masters. Yet why has the situation of Eastern art become so constrained?

    Fan Zeng knew that currently, all major art nations have strict measures to protect their national artworks. To raise the price of their artworks in the global market, they spare no expense to collect them at high prices. China is still poor and lacks the strength to protect its own art. Under these circumstances, Chinese artists can only strive harder than others, with the spirit of Du Fu's "words that do not shock are not worth dying for," to compete for their place in the world!

    Standing at the top of the world's tallest building, Fan Zeng felt an indescribable pain in his heart. He softly said to his American friend, "I should go back to my country. I miss home!" Indeed, he wanted to return to the ancestral land that his ancestors had sung, cried, lived, and died for, and while his youth was still in its prime, to strive with all his might for the revival of Eastern art. He really wanted to shout to the sky: Eastern art cannot remain hidden and buried like this! Although I am just a scholar, I will definitely spare no effort to revive the artistic glory of my motherland!

    This was originally Fan Zeng's intention in 1984 when he came from Beijing to Tianjin to establish the Eastern Art Department at Nankai University. However, before this, he had never revealed this to anyone. He feared that those with narrow minds would say he was "arrogant." However, after returning from America, he threw all his concerns to the winds and began to advocate everywhere. Some close friends quietly advised him, "Brother Fan, you should be careful with your words, don't be too straightforward, it's easy to hurt people!" Fan Zeng replied, "I am crazy for Chinese art, not for myself! You just need to go to the world and see the position of Chinese art, you will also go crazy! Today, there are not too many people in China who are crazy for art, but too few!"

    The Establishment of the Eastern Art Department

    To establish the Eastern Art Department, one must first have a foothold. Fan Zeng came to Nankai with empty hands, initially hoping for state investment. However, Nankai's finances were already strained, and two successive presidents—from Professor Teng Weizhao to Professor Wu Guanguo—were both anxious about the building funds and at a loss, only able to say, "You have to wait." Fan Zeng waited from 1984 to 1986. By then, he was already 46 years old. If he waited a few more years, old age would be upon him, and his patriotic zeal would be in vain. The vigor of his youth once gone, would there still be the abundant strength to serve his country? Fan Zeng felt he could not wait any longer for state investment and began to seek other ways.

    Fan Zeng's inability in interpersonal relationships is well-known; he is even more lacking in economic calculation, and even when penniless, he still had an air of "spending money like water." He never doubted others, which gave those with ulterior motives the opportunity to deceive him. With such a standard, how effective would it be to raise funds from society?

    Soon, a series of amusing incidents occurred: someone said a certain tycoon would donate $200 million; someone advised Fan Zeng to start a shrimp farm; someone offered half a building—with the condition of enrolling his daughter in Tianjin... Such unseemly soap bubbles flashed before Fan Zeng's eyes, but soon burst. He sighed deeply, "You always bring me new hopes with new disappointments."

    Fan Zeng was completely disillusioned. He wandered aimlessly, reciting Li Bai's poem, "The great road is like the sky, but I alone cannot find my way out!" The Eastern Art Building that he had longed for day and night, yearned for in his dreams, where was it? Without it, my Eastern Art Department would forever be a castle in the air, and the thousands of students who hoped to dedicate themselves to Eastern art would only be able to wander outside the school gate, year after year!

    When all paths seemed blocked, Fan Zeng thought of his paintings—this most precious thing to him, his blood, his life, the crystallization of his heart and mind. He decided, with the resolve and determination of a martyr, to use a part of his life to exchange for this building!

    This was a painful choice. Fan Zeng's inner struggle was intense:

    He thought, for thousands of years, since humans began using money as a special equivalent, art has been measured by value. From Leonardo da Vinci, Repin to Picasso, from Qi Baishi, Wu Changshuo to Zhang Daqian, who could escape this fate? The commercialization of art has no relation to the high or low quality of the art itself—when Fan Zeng decided to throw his large collection of works into the market, he had to use the actions of his respected predecessors to convince himself and bolster his resolve!

    He thought, today's China is vigorously promoting a socialist commodity economy. In this tide of commodities, should artists remain aloof, standing outside the current, or should they bravely advance, joining the current? Some say that the commercialization of art damages the artist's purity. What is purity? If we talk about purity, I, Fan Zeng, have never been vulgar. However, the purity of an individual artist is ultimately a personal sentiment. When your beloved, impoverished motherland needs you to abandon everything personal, I am willing to offer my purity to the altar of Eastern art, to be the first sacred sacrifice. I will take pride in this!

    He thought: Throughout history, many eccentric artists have guarded their poverty and solitude, often spending large sums of money to buy back their own works to maintain their value, even burning them rather than letting inferior works remain in the world. I, Fan Zeng, have also gained fame for burning my paintings, with the most I burned being over fifty works. To pursue the perfection of my art, I have paid the price of "breaking bones and tendons," leaving a lasting deformity in my spine. Now, at this crucial moment in my artistic development, to throw so many works into the market in such a short time, is it not self-defeating? There are only two possible outcomes: either to go through another "breaking bones and tendons" or to produce shoddy work, adding water to old wine—these two choices, the former is like placing oneself in a desperate situation to rise again, the latter is undoubtedly drinking poison to kill oneself—I naturally choose the former, even if it means exhausting all my strength, I will strive with my lifetime's art to raise the price of Chinese paintings in the international market; to let future generations know that when the motherland was still weak, there was a son who once adorned her with a shining pearl!

    On December 6, 1986, when Fan Zeng solemnly announced to the 3,000 Nankai teachers and students present at a lecture that he would donate the construction of the Eastern Art Building, the entire audience instantly erupted, with applause and cheers accompanying the excited tears of the young students, lasting for three whole minutes!

    The Impact of the "Painting Hall"

    Fan Zeng's "Painting Hall" initiative was like a stone thrown into water, creating ripples:

    At Nankai, students spread the news, deeply moved; many professors who had taught Fan Zeng praised him, feeling proud to have such a student; the school leadership was also surprised and delighted, with President Wu Guanguo praising Fan Zeng as "Nankai's pride"...

    In Tianjin, Fan Zeng's Painting Hall became a hot topic of conversation in the streets and alleys, even on buses: "Fan Zeng is serious this time, he means business!" Mayor Li Ruihuan praised Fan Zeng's actions as fully embodying the spirit of dedication of Chinese intellectuals...

    At home and abroad, news of Fan Zeng's Painting Hall spread like wildfire. Some admired him, some were shocked, some seemed to hear tales of a distant land, and some thought Fan Zeng was again "crazy," mockingly saying: Fan Zeng just loves to make a show, always making wild statements, accusing him of selling paintings to build a hall as disgracing all Chinese painters, as a "cheap sale" of Chinese paintings...

    Fan Zeng never imagined that his sincere efforts would invite such slander. He swallowed the bitter fruit of a pioneer's loneliness and began the "Painting Hall"—every time he entered the studio, it was as if he was carrying a spiritual cross. He told himself, "Fan Zeng, don't complain, don't argue, don't be troubled by the filthy words of small-minded people. Since you believe your actions are righteous, just grit your teeth and go on, let them say what they want!"

    The difficulty of the Painting Hall is probably beyond imagination—he divided each day into four units: getting up at 4 AM, from 4 to 9 AM for the first unit; after breakfast, from 9:30 AM to 12 PM for the second unit; a short rest at noon, from 3 PM to 6 PM for the third unit; from 7 PM to 11 PM at night for the fourth unit. Day after day, he worked at his desk, forgetting to sleep and eat. Sometimes, guests would visit "Baochong Studio," but he, unlike his usual chatty self, would not lift his head or stop his brush, letting them come and go as they pleased. Gradually, friends noticed that the once vibrant and outspoken Jiangdong scholar had become silent and withdrawn. Every night, he had to rely on a masseur to massage his deformed spine, propping himself up in front of the painting desk, his brush dancing.

    Fan Zeng poured all his passion, blood, talent, and skills onto the pristine xuan paper. It was less that he was painting for ancient figures and more that he was pouring out his admiration and longing for the heroes and sages of the Chinese nation over thousands of years—

    He saw Qu Yuan chanting the "Li Sao" walking towards him. Thus, his brush created Qu Yuan, beckoning to the eagle, his face gaunt but dignified, full of righteousness;
    He painted the poet Li He, thin and gaunt, sorrow filling the valleys, his patriotic zeal wasted on high mountains and flowing water;
    He painted the poet Du Fu, in a white robe, standing in the west pavilion, facing the ruined mountains and remaining waters, bowing and chanting;
    He painted Xin Qiji, still hearing the absolute song: "Looking at the Wu hook, patting the railing, no one understands, the intention of climbing";
    Sometimes, he borrowed a breath of free and unconstrained spirit from Su Dongpo; sometimes, he soared with Laozi in the boundless space of thought...

    Fan Zeng was immersed in this wondrous artistic realm, unaware of the dawn or the setting sun. Paintings piled up, hanging on the walls, stuck in cabinets, spread on carpets. From winter to summer in 1986, enduring harsh winters and scorching summers, experiencing countless hardships and sorrows, he finally completed over 200 works. Many art friends, after viewing the paintings, marveled: So many figures, each with a distinct personality; so many themes, not a single one repeated; countless lines, not a single clumsy stroke, full of energy and vitality!

    From the Warm Spring of Japan to the Autumn Chill of Hong Kong

    In early spring of 1987, during the "warm yet cold" season, Fan Zeng boarded a plane heading towards the islands of Japan...

    Fan Zeng had been to Japan many times, but the anxious and restless mood he felt this time was unprecedented. This was understandable, as the success of the Painting Hall depended on the outcome of the auction in Japan. This time, Fan Zeng chose the auction hall "Takashimaya Gallery," the most prestigious in Japan. Only first-class artists had the honor of exhibiting there, and China had only a few renowned artists like Liu Haisu, Li Keran, Wu Zuoren, and Guan Shanyue who had exhibited there.

    Japanese friends, including Mr. Gong Zhenyi, the vice-director of Fan Zeng Art Museum, welcomed Fan Zeng at the airport and briefed him on the exhibition preparations. The meticulous arrangements by Japanese friends slightly reassured him. The spring breeze was still chilly. The exhibition opened, and Fan Zeng, dressed in a suit, greeted the guests. To his surprise, before the exhibition hall even opened, a crowd had gathered outside. After the ribbon-cutting, a buying frenzy immediately ensued. A set of "Li Sao" sold for 10 million yen (equivalent to 300,000 yuan), and the "Nine Songs" set sold for 7 million yen. After that, the momentum was unstoppable.

    What particularly moved Fan Zeng was that in the sea of people, an elderly man with white hair approached him. This was 92-year-old Japanese social activist and Premier Zhou Enlai's close friend, Gong Zikeping. As the chairman of the organizing committee for this exhibition, Gong Zikeping today led the way by buying a small painting "Yazi," though small, Fan Zeng deeply felt the extraordinary significance of the old man's gesture. Later, when Gong Zikeping learned that all the works had been sold out and the exhibition was a complete success, he called Fan Zeng, who was in Okayama, from Tokyo, his voice choked with emotion, saying, "I am as happy as if my own child had succeeded, I am so moved that I shed tears of joy."

    This 20-day exhibition, from Tokyo to Osaka, then to Okayama, wherever Fan Zeng went, a Fan Zeng storm swept through, creating a rare spectacle in the Japanese art world. However, there was a stark contrast: Fan Zeng became a millionaire overnight, yet he insisted on staying in small inns instead of hotels. Informed reporters even learned that Fan Zeng did not open the refrigerator in his room to take drinks, which was almost unimaginable! A reporter, not without mockery, asked, "Mr. Fan, a single calligraphy piece is worth 50 million yen, why are you so stingy with personal consumption?" Fan Zeng calmly replied, "It's simple, all the expenses for this exhibition must be deducted from the auction proceeds. Everyone knows, this money is donated to the construction of the Eastern Art Building, I have no right to waste it. Besides, it's not just me who doesn't stay in hotels, Japanese friend Gong Zhenyi also does the same. I think this is a way of promoting a spirit. I don't care about appearances, nor do I care if others look down on me, just come and see my exhibition!"

    According to the contract, "Takashimaya Gallery" took 1/3 of the painting sales, deducted all expenses, and Fan Zeng's share was about 180 million yuan, which meant the Eastern Art Building was "painted" halfway!

    The other half of the building's funds was originally planned to be raised in Hong Kong in the autumn. Fan Zeng returned to Tianjin from Japan, excited and radiant, and immediately revealed the auction plan to the reporters.

    However, as summer turned to autumn, there was no news from the Hong Kong trip; as leaves withered and grass turned yellow, Fan Zeng remained inactive. What had happened?

    Westerners often lament that the world is shrinking, small enough to be like a family, any sneeze by a family member affects others—on October 19, 1987, Wall Street in New York sneezed, stocks plummeted, shaking the world, and even Hong Kong, on the other side of the Pacific, was like frostbitten leaves, losing its vitality. Information from all sides poured into Fan Zeng's small "Baochong Studio": the people of Hong Kong had suffered a great disaster, their spirits were low, and they were anxious about their own future, who had the heart to look at exhibitions and buy paintings? Fan Zeng instinctively felt that this trip to Hong Kong was like taking chestnuts from the fire, risking danger. Thus, he decisively canceled the exhibition and sought another way.

    Where was the way out? Fan Zeng was depressed, his worries unending. He did not understand why "good things take time" always happened to him? Even Wall Street on the other side of the Atlantic seemed to be against him. Those days, Fan Zeng ate without tasting, slept without resting. Just as he was at a loss, suddenly came an unexpected good news: a Hong Kong businessman surnamed Zhang generously decided to buy all the works Fan Zeng had prepared for Hong Kong with 14 million yuan, to support his donation to build the hall—truly, heaven rewards diligence, the Eastern Art Building was finally "painted"!

    In the following days, Fan Zeng slept soundly, sleeping until he was dizzy, his snores like thunder. In his dreams, he vaguely heard the rumbling of excavators.

    "Reconstructing the Soul, Starting with Myself"

    Some say that Fan Zeng is the most controversial painter in today's China, and at the same time, the most respected. The scales of praise and criticism are balanced on his head, and with every step, they sway a few times.

    However, "strong winds reveal strong grass, and turbulent times reveal loyal subjects." The motherland and the people are always the most just, and for artists who make selfless contributions with all their sincerity, they will surely give more sincere returns—wasn't there someone who mocked Fan Zeng for wanting to "buy" a position as a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference? Unthinkingly, this trivial slander became a reality later—at the last meeting of the Sixth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Fan Zeng was added as a member. In March 1988, the usually disheveled painter, dressed in a neat dark blue suit, his slightly frosted hair combed neatly, walked into the Great Hall of the People, radiant, to attend the first session of the Seventh National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

    Originally, as a new member, Fan Zeng only wanted to listen more and observe more during the conference. However, when he personally witnessed the passionate and unforgettable sentiments of several generations of intellectuals at the Political Consultative Conference; when he acutely felt the democratic atmosphere; when he, together with the members, worried about the backwardness and dangers of the motherland, grieved over the loss and decline of the national spirit, and struggled for the revival and rise of the Chinese nation, Fan Zeng, this vigorous man, could no longer sit still and prepared to express his feelings on the solemn podium of the conference. He locked his door, spread the paper, and wrote with a brush, his emotions surging, his blood boiling...

    Forty minutes later, an article titled "Reconstructing the Soul, Reviving the Spirit" was placed on the desk of the conference secretariat. The conference organizers immediately decided to invite Fan Zeng to speak at the conference the next day.

    "Reconstructing the Soul"—a slogan full of appeal resonated and spread at the Political Consultative Conference.

    From "reviving Eastern art" to "reconstructing the Chinese soul," Fan Zeng realized self-renewal in his dedication and welcomed the elevation of his ideals in his worries. His heart echoed with such a monologue: "A nation without ideals will only be a stagnant nation; a nation completely shrouded in selfishness will also be a declining nation! If our ideal is to reconstruct the soul and revive China, then let's start with ourselves today!"

    This time, no one mocked him for his wild statements, his actions had already provided the most practical and powerful evidence for his "wild statements"!

    The Scholar's Tears

    Fan Zeng's "Painting Hall" initiative, like the silent peach and plum blossoms, infected almost everyone related to the Eastern Art Building.

    The design bidding for the Eastern Art Building began, with more than ten first-class experts from seven first-class architectural design institutes in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Wuhan, and other places, each bringing their meticulous works to compete. A building costing only 300 million yuan attracted such high attention from the architectural community, this fact alone was extraordinary; even more extraordinary was that the seven design institutes unanimously made a joint commitment: regardless of which institute won, the design fee would be donated—later, the winning Beijing Architectural Design Institute indeed fulfilled the promise.

    The construction of this building was undertaken by Tianjin Municipal Fourth Construction Company and the Tianjin Construction Decoration Co., Ltd., a joint venture with Hong Kong. They conducted a comprehensive engineering budget based on the design plan and found that due to factors such as the rise in building materials, the actual engineering cost had already exceeded the total investment of 350 million yuan—what to do? Let the painter "paint" another corner of the building? No, the constructors resolutely decided to donate the 1.7 million yuan excess in the budget as a donation.

    Artists from Beijing, Tianjin, and even all over the country volunteered to provide artworks to the future Eastern Art Building.

    World-renowned mathematician Professor Shengshen Chen, at the foundation-laying ceremony, personally handed a check for $5,000 to Fan Zeng, as support for his junior's cause.

    Donation and taking, like heaven and earth, but in reality, they are often only a step away.

    Now, the square foundation stone was finally placed on the site of the Eastern Art Building. The moment described in the opening of this article, which Fan Zeng had dreamed of for three years, finally arrived. What was unusual was that Fan Zeng seemed very calm at this moment. This reminded me of a saying he once mentioned: "The center of a typhoon is always calm."

    Before the foundation-laying, the school had a proposal to name the building after Fan Zeng, which was politely declined by Fan Zeng. He said, I donate this building, and name it after myself, the feeling is not good. His tone was open and calm. At the foundation-laying ceremony, guests gathered like clouds, spectators like waves, and many speakers used various beautiful words to praise his Painting Hall initiative, but he did not show any sign of pride or self-satisfaction, his two eyes like two pools of clear autumn water. At that moment, I was standing behind him. However, when the famous writer and Fan Zeng's friend Feng Jicai took the microphone to speak, I found that the calm of the "typhoon center" was finally broken—

    Feng Jicai said, "Last night, a 'street eccentric' came to my house and talked to me for over three hours. His main topic was how he used money to smooth out various relationships and paths in society. In his view, there is nothing that money cannot buy. I didn't say anything to him. Today, I came to this venue, and I saw Fan Zeng. I suddenly had a strong desire, I want to call the 'eccentric' right now and tell him this sentence—there is something in this world that money cannot buy, that is a person's soul!"

    In the thunderous applause of the entire audience, tears glistened in Fan Zeng's eyes.

    "A scholar's patriotism, how can it be forgotten, the souls of Qu Yuan and Du Fu"—Professor Yejia Ying's poem was a true reflection of Fan Zeng's heart at that moment.

    In those days, Fan Zeng, when announcing the decision to build the Painting Hall, had emotionally predicted, "When the first shovel of soil is dug for the building, I will definitely throw myself down to kiss this clump of mother school's soil, just like Chopin kissing the soil of his homeland!"

    Now, when the first shovel of soil was dug for the foundation, more than a dozen cameras almost simultaneously focused on Fan Zeng holding the shovel—unexpectedly, at this moment, he suddenly threw down the shovel and squeezed out of the foundation-laying crowd...

    Ah, the 93-year-old Gong Zikeping, who had specially come to attend the ceremony, did not listen to others' advice and insisted on personally shoveling the soil for the foundation stone, was walking towards the foundation stone with unsteady steps. Fan Zeng quickly went to meet him...

    After Fan Zeng helped the 93-year-old Gong Zikeping shovel the soil for the foundation, he realized that the first shovel of soil he had not yet kissed had already been buried by the many foundation-layers in the ground.

    Fan Zeng clearly showed a hint of regret, touching the corner of the foundation stone exposed on the ground, he said to me with regret, "Just now, you should have reminded me!" Then he seemed to have an enlightenment, muttering to himself, "Reminding is also too late—the affairs of the world are really too fast, three years of dreams, all like this brief moment!"

    I said, "Indeed!"

　　忧思的升华［报告文学］
　　——范曾画楼记
　　侯军
    １９８８年１０月１８日上午１１时３０分。
    南开大学的马蹄湖畔。
    一块方方正正的大理石，一半浅埋入土，一半露在外边，上写：
    南开大学东方艺术楼奠基石
    一些细心人发现，同平素已经叫惯了的称谓相比，东方艺术“楼”前分明少了一个“大”字，是书者一时疏忽，还是有意省略？
    是啊，这将要崛起的建筑不过４０００平方米，总投资额不过３５０万元，配得上那个“大”字吗？有人说，当今中国像个大工地，在这个大工地上，动辄几千万，它算老几？
    然而，对于他，一个赤手空拳，只有秃笔数杆的画家来说，这个４０００平方米，这个３５０万元，实在是过于浩大的数目了。为此，他画了３年！
    但是，为什么这位一向处世行事决不疏漏的书画家，偏偏在书写奠基石的铭文时，漏掉了这个“大”字呢？
    我问范曾。范曾以少见的虔诚神态答曰：“释迦牟尼说过：一滴水倘不愿干涸，到大海中去——今天，当我把这滴心灵之水真的投进大海的时候，我忽然发现了它的渺小，它的微薄，我岂敢妄自称‘大’？”
    后来人或许永远也看不到那块省去了“大”字的奠基石了，作为目击者，我觉得有责任记下这埋进地底的一切——因为那里边蕴含着许多地面上迫切急需而又恰恰缺乏的东西！
    　　　　东方艺术的狂想
    １９８６．纽约。
    好高的楼哇，倒了好几次电梯才到了顶层：第１０７层。这是世界上最高的人造峰巅——世界贸易大厦，从这云端之上可以鸟瞰曼哈顿的全景，只见高楼如林、车水马龙，黄金堆成的城市极尽人间繁华。
    “范先生，感觉如何？”金发碧眼的美国友人不无炫耀地问。
    范曾没有说话，只是轻轻地“嗯”了一声。西方那种君临天下的气势，那种领袖寰球的傲慢，使他感到压抑，心灵为之震颤。他想起几天前，在华盛顿博物馆看到的那些精美绝伦的艺术品。他惊异叹服，同时也感到不平：一幅伦勃朗的画，售价就可以盖一座中国美术馆，而美国一个博物馆就收藏了十几幅；一幅梵高的作品，在这里能拍卖到５５００万美元的高价，而中国艺术大师齐白石的作品，有时价格仅有几千美元——这公平吗？中国艺术家的才气、智能和高超的艺术技巧，是举世公认的；中国的传统艺术形式、表现手法和东方艺术的魅力，为许多西方艺术大师所折服，然而为什么东方艺术的处境竟变得如此局促呢？
    范曾知道，目前世界各艺术大国都有一条保护本国艺术品的严密措施，为了抬高本国艺术品在世界市场的价格，不惜重金高价收藏。而中国目前还很贫穷，还没有力量保护自己的艺术。在这种情况下，中国艺术家只能比别人更加发愤，以杜甫“语不惊人死不休”的气概，到世界上去争得自己的地位！
    站在世界高楼之最的顶层，范曾只觉得内心一阵难言的隐痛，他对美国友人轻声说：“我该回国了，我想家了！”是啊，他要赶回那祖祖辈辈为之歌、为之哭、为之生、为之死的桑梓之地，乘着自己年华方壮，为东方艺术品振兴而竭尽全力。他真想仰天长啸：东方美术不能再这样韬光养晦，这样被沉埋了！我虽一介书生，但一定要拚尽全力，重振祖国艺术的雄风！
    这原本是范曾１９８４年自京来津创办南大东方艺术系的初衷，但是，在此之前，他从未向别人吐露过。他怕那些气量过小的人又说他“狂妄”。然而，当他自美返国之后，他把一切顾虑都抛到九霄云外，开始到处奔走呼号了。有些知己悄悄劝他：“范兄，你讲话要注意分寸，不要太质直，容易伤人的！”范曾答道：“我是为中国艺术而狂，不是为我个人！你只要到世界上去看看中国艺术品的地位，你也会发狂的！当今中国为艺术发狂的人不是太多，而是太少！”
    　　　　向世界出卖智慧
    创办东方艺术系，必须先有一个立足之地。范曾两手空空来南开，一开始还希望国家投资。但是，南开的财力正捉襟见肘，两任校长——从滕维藻教授到毋国光教授，都为建楼资金着急，一筹莫展，只能说：“你要等一等。”范曾从１９８４年一直等到１９８６年。那时他已四十有六，再等几年就会老冉冉其将至，一腔报国之志，岂不空付流水？身内的青春一旦消逝，身外还有那充沛的报国之力吗？范曾觉得不能再坐等国家投资了，他开始寻求别的出路。
    范曾在人际关系上的无能，是众人皆知的；他在经济上更缺乏谋算，即使囊空如洗，还是一副“挥金陌上郎”的神气。他对别人从不怀疑，这使那些居心叵测的人总有机会让他上当。以如此水准去社会上筹措资金，效果如何可想而知。
    不久，便发生了接踵而来的一些趣事：有人说某巨商将送２００万美元；有人劝范曾搞养虾场；有人要送半幢楼——以调其女儿进津为条件……这种种不雅的肥皂泡影，在范曾眼前闪过，不久都破裂了。他喟然长叹：“你们总拿新的希望给我带来新的失望。”
    范曾彻底失望了。他怅然若失地低吟着李太白的诗句：“大道如青天，我独不得出！”那朝思暮想、梦寐以求的东方艺术大楼啊，你在哪里？没有你，我的东方艺术系就永远是一个空中楼阁，那期望献身东方艺术的百千学子，就只能在校门之外徘徊踯躅，年复一年！
    当所有道路都走不通时，范曾想到了他的画——这是他视之如生命的最珍贵的东西，是他的血、他的生命、他心与智的结晶，——他要以殉道者的决心和毅力，用自己生命的一部分，去换这座大楼！
    这是一个痛苦的抉择。范曾的内心深处展开了一场灵魂的搏斗：
    他在想，几千年来，从人类开始运用货币这种特殊的等价物以后，艺术就已经用价值来衡量了。古往今来的艺术大师，从达·芬奇、列宾到毕加索，从齐白石、吴昌硕到张大千，谁又能逃此大限？艺术成为商品同艺术本身品格的高低，原无关系——当范曾要把自己的大批作品抛向市场的时候，他不得不用自己所敬仰的先辈的行动来说服自己，为自己壮行！
    他在想，当今中国正在大力推进社会主义商品经济，在这商品的大潮中，艺术家是孤芳自赏，置身于潮流之外呢？还是激流勇进，投身于潮流之中？有人说，艺术成为商品，有损艺术家的清高。什么叫清高？若论清高，我范曾何尝鄙俗？但是，艺术家个人的清高，毕竟是一己情怀，当你所挚爱的贫穷的祖国需要你抛弃个人的一切时，我甘愿将自己的清高慷慨地献上东方艺术的祭坛，去做第一个神圣的牺牲，我将以此为自豪！
    他在想：古往今来多少画坛怪杰，坚守着清贫的寂寞之道，为了保持自己作品的价值，常常不惜重金大量收购自己的作品，宁可烧掉，也不让非属一流的作品留在世上。我范曾在几十年绘画生涯中，同样以烧画而闻名，最多的一次烧掉了五十多幅作品。为了追求自己艺术的完美，我付出了“抽筋折骨”的代价，至今依然留下脊柱侧弯的后遗症。如今，正当自己艺术发展的关键时刻，如此大量如此集中地把作品抛到市场上，岂不是自折其价？要在短时间内绘制出这么多画，只会有两种结局：要么再来一次“抽筋折骨”；要么就是粗制滥造，往陈年老窖里兑水——这两种选择，前一种就像置之死地而后生，后一种则无疑是饮鸩自戕——我理所当然要选择前者，即便拚尽全力，也要以自己毕生的艺术，为提高中国画在国际市场的价格而奋斗；要让后代子孙知道，当祖国母亲还很羸弱的时候，曾有一个并不富有的儿子为她镶上过一颗晶莹的珍珠！
    １９８６年１２月６日，当范曾在一次讲演中郑重地向在场的３０００名南开师生，首次宣布自己将捐建东方艺术大楼的决定时，全场顿时沸腾了，掌声、欢呼声伴着青年学子们激动的热泪，整整持续了三分钟！
    　　　　“画楼”不止
    范曾的“画楼”之举，如同巨石入水，激起了层层涟漪：
    在南开，大学生们奔走相告，感奋不已；许多曾教过范曾的老教授啧啧称赞，为有这样的学生而深感欣慰；校领导更是惊喜异常，毋国光校长称赞范曾是“南开的骄傲”……
    在天津，范曾画楼一时间成了街谈巷议的热门话题，连公共汽车上都在议论：“范曾动真格儿的了，够意思！”李瑞环市长则称范曾的做法充分体现了中国知识分子的奉献精神……
    在国内、在海外，范曾画楼的消息不胫而走，有人钦佩，有人惊愕，有人似听“海客谈瀛洲”，有人以为范曾又发“少年狂”，不无讥讽地扬言：范曾就爱出风头，好为狂言，指责他卖画盖楼是丢了全国画家的脸，是对中国画的“贱价拍卖”……
    范曾作梦也没想到，自己一腔赤诚，竟会招致这般诋毁。他是吞咽着先行者孤独的苦果，开始“画楼”的——每当他走进画室，就像是同时背上了一座精神的十字架。他对自己说：“范曾，不要叫苦，不要争辩，不要被器小量微的污言秽语所困扰，既然你认定自己的行动是正大光明的，那就咬紧牙关走下去，任他们说去吧！”
    画楼的艰难，大概是旁人无法想象的——他把每天的时间分成四个单元：凌晨四点起床，从四点到九点为第一单元；早餐之后，从九点半至十二点为第二单元；午间稍事休息，从下午三点到六点为第三单元；从晚上七点到深夜十一点为第四单元。日日伏案，废寝忘食。时有客人光顾“抱冲斋”，他一反往日待客神聊的常态，头不抬，笔不停，任尔来去。渐渐的，朋友们发现，昔日神采奕奕狂言惊座的江东才子变得沉默寡言息交绝游。每天晚上，须靠按摩师揉按捏打才能强撑住侧弯变形的脊柱，在画案前笔走龙蛇。
    范曾把自己的全部激情、心血、才能和技巧统统抛洒在洁白的宣纸上，与其说他是在为古人造像，不如说他是在向千百年来中华民族的英杰豪士尽情地倾诉胸中的全部倾慕与神往——
    他看到屈原吟诵着《离骚》向他走来。于是，他的笔下出现了正向雄鹰招手的屈原，面目清癯而庄严，一派凛然正气；
    他画诗鬼李贺，瘦骨嶙峋，悲满潭壑，一腔报国之志，徒付高山流水；
    他画诗圣杜甫，一身素白的衣衫，伫立西阁，面对国破家亡的残山剩水，俯仰吟哦；
    他画辛弃疾，犹听稼轩绝唱：“把吴钩看了，栏杆拍遍，无人会，登临意”；
    有时，他从东坡居士那里借得一缕清旷豪迈之气；有时，他伴随老子在那无际无涯的思维空间翱游……
    范曾沉浸在奇妙无比的艺术境界中，不知东方之既白，不知夕阳之西下。画，越积越多，挂在墙上，贴在柜子上，铺在地毯上。从１９８６年冬至至１９８７年夏，历尽严冬酷暑，尝遍艰难苦恨，终于完成了２００多幅作品。许多艺术界朋友览画之余，惊奇地称道：如此众多的人物，竟全都个性鲜明；如此纷繁的题材，竟无一幅雷同；无法计数的线条，竟无粗陋的败笔，气力充足，气韵生动！
    　　　　从扶桑春暖到香港秋寒
    １９８７年早春２月，“乍暖还寒时候”。范曾乘坐的飞机向东瀛诸岛凌空飞去……
    范曾已多次赴日，但此刻那种忐忑不安的心情却是从未有过的。这也难怪，画楼能否成功，关键在于去日义卖的效果。此次范曾所选定的义卖展厅，是日本最负盛名的“高岛屋画廊”。只有第一流的艺术家才有资格跻身其间，中国曾有刘海粟、李可染、吴作人、关山月等有数的几位名家在此举办过展览。
    日本朋友、范曾美术馆副馆长冈本诚一先生等在机场迎候范曾并向他介绍了画展的准备情况。日本友人的精心安排，使他略感几分宽慰。初春时节，寒风依然料峭。画展开幕了，范曾西装革履，迎候嘉宾。出乎他意料的是，展厅尚未开门，门前就聚集起不少观众。剪彩之后，立即出现了抢购的盛况。一部册页《离骚图》竟以１０００万日元（相当于３０万人民币）的高价售出；册页《九歌图》也以７００万日元成交。此后，势如破竹，一发而不可收。
    尤其令范曾感动的是，在万头攒动的人流中，一位白发皤然的长者向他走来，那是９２岁高龄的日本著名社会活动家、周恩来总理的挚友冈崎嘉平太。作为本次画展的实行委员会主任，冈崎老人今天带头买下了一幅《雅子图》，这虽是一幅小画，但范曾却深深体味出老人此举的非凡意蕴。此后，当冈崎老人得知全部作品均已售罄，画展取得完满成功的消息时，他从东京打电话给正在冈山的范曾，声音哽咽地说：“我像听到自己的孩子获得成功一样，高兴得流下热泪。”　　这次２０天的画展从东京到大坂，又到冈山，每到一处，一阵范曾台风席卷，这在日本蔚为艺坛奇观。但是有一个与此形成鲜明对比的情况，却令许多日本记者大惑不解：范曾一夜之间成了百万富翁，可是他却一直不住宾馆，而只在小旅馆里下榻。了解内情的记者甚至闻知范曾竟然不肯打开房间内的冰箱取饮料，这简直是不可思议的！一位记者不无讥笑地发问：“范先生一张字就值５０万日元，为何在个人消费上如此铢锱计较？”范曾坦然地答道：“很简单，此次画展的所有开销都要从义卖所得中扣除。诸位知道，这笔钱是我捐献给东方艺术大楼的建设资金，我没有权力浪费它。再说，不住宾馆的也不只我个人，日本朋友冈本诚一先生也是如此。我认为，这样做是在弘扬一种精神。我不讲什么排场，也不管别人会不会瞧不起我，去看我的画展好了！”
    按合同规定，“高岛屋画廊”提取了卖画收入的１／３，扣除一切费用，范曾所得折合人民币１８０万元左右，这就是说，东方艺术大楼已经“画”成了一半！
    大楼的另外一半资金，原订于秋天到香港展卖筹集。范曾从日本奏凯回津，兴高采烈，神采飞扬，记者一经探问，他立即将义卖计划和盘托出。
    然而夏去春来，香港之行杳无音讯；叶枯草黄，范曾依然按兵不动。究竟发生了什么变故？
    西方人常常感叹当今地球正在变小，小得像一个家庭，任何一个家庭成员打个喷嚏，都会波及其他成员——１９８７年１０月１９日，美国纽约华尔街打了一个大喷嚏，股票暴跌，震动全球，远在大洋此岸的香港，竟也像霜打败叶，生气顿销。来自各方面的信息向范曾的小小“抱冲斋”汇集：港人遭此大难，情绪低落，对自身前途尚且惶惶不可终日，谁还有心思看画展买画？范曾直觉地感到，此次赴港如同火中取栗难保无虞。于是，他断然决定，取消这次画展，另谋出路。
    出路在哪里呢？范曾心情抑郁，愁思难解。他不明白，为什么“好事多磨”总是“磨”到自己头上？连大西洋畔的华尔街都故意与他作对。那些天，范曾食不甘味，寝不安席。正当苦于无计之时，忽然传来一个意外的佳音：香港一位姓张的大实业家，慨然决定以人民币１４０万元的巨资，全数收购范曾准备赴港的所有展品，以助其捐资建楼的义举——有道是天道酬勤，东方艺术大楼终于“画”成了！
    此后数日，范曾蒙头大睡，直睡得昏天黑地，酣声如雷。在梦中，他依稀听到了隆隆的掘土机声。
    　　　　“再造民魂，从我自己做起”
    有人说，范曾是当今中国招致非议最多的画家，同时，又是赢得尊敬最多的画家，毁誉的天平就顶在他的头上，每走一步，都要晃上几晃。
    然而，“疾风知劲草，板荡识诚臣”。祖国和人民永远是最公正的，对于以自己全部真诚做出无私奉献的艺术家，总会做出更真诚的回报——当初，不是有人讽刺范曾想“买”个政协委员当吗？不想这无聊的诋毁却刚好变成了后来的事实——在六届全国政协的最后一次会议上，范曾被增补为全国政协委员。１９８８年阳春三月，一向不修边幅的画家，身着笔挺的深蓝色西装，微霜染鬓的头发梳理得整整齐齐，容光焕发地迈进了人民大会堂，出席七届政协一次会议。
    本来，作为一个新委员，范曾只想在会议期间多听听，多看看。然而，当他亲眼目睹了政协会议上几代知识分子慨当以慷、忧思难忘的情怀；当他敏锐地感受到扑面而来的民主气息；当他同委员们一起为祖国的落后与危难而焦虑，为民魂的失落与消沉而痛心，为中华民族的中兴与崛起而奋争的时候，范曾这个血气方刚的汉子再也坐不住了，准备到大会庄严的讲坛上一抒怀抱。他倒锁房门，展纸挥毫，笔卷狂涛，忧思绵绵，亢奋的激情，使他周身热血沸腾……
    四十多分钟后，一篇题为《再造民魂重振雄风》的热血文字摆到了大会秘书处的书案上，大会组织者当即决定请范曾第二天作大会发言。
    “再造民魂”——一个富于感召力的口号在政协会议上叫响了，传开了。
    从“振兴东方艺术”，到“再造中华民魂”，范曾在奉献中实现着自我的更新，在忧思中迎来了理想的升华。他的心灵深处反复震响着这样的独白：“一个没有理想的民族，只会是一个死气沉沉的民族；一个完全为利己主义所笼罩的民族，也将是一个衰败的民族！如果我们的理想是民魂再造，振兴中华，那么，今天就从自己做起吧！”
    这回，没有谁再讥笑他口出狂言了，他的行动已经为自己的“狂言”做出了最实际有力的明证！
    　　　　书生泪
    范曾的“画楼之举”，似桃李无言，感染了几乎所有同东方艺术大楼发生关系的人。
    东方艺术大楼的设计招标开始了，来自北京、上海、天津、武汉等地七个第一流建筑设计院的十多位第一流专家，带着十多个精心之作前来角逐、竞争。一个造价不过３００多万元的小楼，引起建筑界如此高度的重视，这件事本身就不同寻常；而更加不同寻常的是，七家设计院竟一致做出了共同的承诺：无论哪家中标，设计费都将无偿奉献——后来中标的北京建筑设计院果然实践了诺言。
    承建这座大楼的是天津市市政四公司和中港合资天津建筑装饰有限公司。他们根据设计方案进行了全面工程预算，发现由于建筑原料涨价等因素，实际工程成本已经超过了３５０万元的投资总额——怎么办？让画家再“画”一个楼角吗？不，承建者毅然决定，将预算超出的１７万元，权作公司的无偿奉献。
    京津两地乃至全国各地的艺术家纷纷提出，要向未来的东方艺术大楼提供艺术精品。
    世界著名数学大师陈省身教授，在大楼奠基典礼的仪式上，亲手将一张５０００美元的支票交到范曾的手中，作为对后辈事业的支持。
    奉献与索取，形如天壤，但在实际生活中，却往往只有一步之遥。
    如今，那块方方正正的奠基石终于摆到了东方艺术大楼的基址上。画家梦萦三载的如我在本文开篇描绘的那样的时刻终于来到了。不同寻常的是范曾此时却显得非常宁静。这使我想起他讲过的一个警句：“台风的中心永远是平静的。”
    奠基前，学校曾有一个动议，希望以范曾的名字为大楼命名，被范曾婉言谢绝了。他说，我捐建这个大楼，而以我个人命名，观感欠佳。语气坦荡而平和。奠基仪式上，来宾如云，观者如潮，诸多发言者使用各种美妙的赞词，称颂他的画楼义举，而他却并没有表现出任何得意或自矜，两只眸子像是两湾明澈的秋水。此时，我正站在他的身后。然而，当著名作家、范曾的好友冯骥才拿起话筒致词时，我发现“台风中心”的平静终于被打破了——
    冯骥才说：“昨天晚上，有一个‘市井奇人’来到我家，跟我聊了三个多小时。他的中心话题是讲他如何用钱打通社会上各种关系和路子。在他看来，没有拿钱买不到的。我对他没说什么。今天，我来到这个会场，我看到了范曾，我忽然升起一个饥渴的欲望，我想现在就给‘奇人’打个电话，告诉他这样一句话——在这个世界上还有一种东西是拿钱买不到的，那就是一个人的灵魂！”
    在全场如潮的掌声中，范曾眼角闪起了莹光。
    “书生报国成何计，难忘诗骚屈杜魂”——诗人叶嘉莹教授的这句诗正是范曾此刻心曲的真实写照。
    当年，范曾在宣布画楼的决定时，曾动情地预言：“当大楼动工的第一锹土挖起的时候，我一定要扑下身去亲吻这一撮母校的泥土，就像肖邦亲吻故国的土地一样！”
    而今，当大楼奠基的第一锹土挖起的时候，十几架摄影机几乎同时对准了持锹的范曾——不料，恰在这时，他忽然扔下了铁锹，挤出了奠基的人群……
    啊，专程前来参加盛典的冈崎嘉平太老人，不肯听从旁人的劝告，执意要亲自为基石培土，正在步履蹒跚地向奠基石走来。范曾急忙迎上前去……
    当范曾搀扶着９３岁的冈崎老人挥锹奠基之后，他才发现，他那尚未亲吻的第一锹土，早已被众多的奠基者争先恐后地埋在大地之下了。
    范曾分明现出了几分惆怅，手抚露出地面的基石一角，无不遗憾地对我说：“刚才，你应该给我提醒一下！”接着又若有所悟地自语道：“提醒也来不及——世间的事情真是太快了，三年梦想，都像是这么短短的一瞬！”
    我说：“可不是！”
