Chairman Yang Greets Farmers for the New Year
New China News Agency reporter Zhang Xingduan

On the second day of the Lunar New Year, Chairman Yang Shangkun braved a light drizzle to visit the rural areas of Yangzhou City, Jiangsu Province, to greet the farmers.

A spring rain had turned the wheat fields green. Accompanied by Jiangsu Provincial Party Secretary Han Peixin, Governor Gu Xiuyan, and Nanjing Military Region Commander Xiang Shouzhi, Yang Shangkun walked into the home of Li Zhangrong, a farmer from Dianzhuang Village in the outskirts of Yangzhou. Yang Shangkun took the hand of the female host, Gao Juhuang, and said, "Happy New Year!" Gao Juhuang, excited, greeted Yang Shangkun and his entourage, and brought her young son in front of Yang Shangkun to wish him a happy new year.

Yang Shangkun looked around the three-room brick house, seeing New Year paintings and spring couplets on the walls, and a table piled high with oranges and candies. A large color television was playing a cultural program, creating a festive atmosphere. He happily said, "You have plenty of New Year's goods!" After sitting down in the main room, he carefully inquired about the family's living situation. Gao Juhuang told Yang Shangkun that she was a pig-raising specialist, raising 170 pigs last year, selling 112, and earning a net income of 13,000 yuan.

Yang Shangkun asked, "How many laborers are there in your family?"

Li Zhangrong said, "Our family has five people. I work in a village-run factory, my wife raises pigs at home, and we also farm 1.2 mu of grain fields. I help with some farm work in the morning and evening. My mother takes care of the cooking, and my son goes to school."

Yang Shangkun pointed to the female host and said, "So, your family's income mainly comes from her?"

Li Zhangrong replied, "Yes, she's the backbone of the family."

Yang Shangkun and his entourage all laughed. The laughter filled the room with warmth.

Led by the hosts, Yang Shangkun inspected the bedroom and kitchen. He saw large marble blocks piled up at the kitchen door and asked, "Are you planning to build a new house?"

Li Zhangrong's 76-year-old mother, standing by, replied, "We're planning to build a new house." Yang Shangkun took the old woman's hand and said, "You're fortunate!" The old woman, excited, said, "Thanks to the Communist Party, and thanks to Chairman Yang's care!"

Yang Shangkun walked out of the house, holding the hands of Li Zhangrong and Gao Juhuang, saying, "I wish you raise more pigs and contribute more." He then bent down to their son and said, "Little friend, study hard."

Yang Shangkun then walked to another household by the roadside. The owner, Tian Jiaxiang, was a middle school principal in the village, and his wife was an elementary school teacher. Yang Shangkun happily said, "Great, you are a family of teachers, nurturing the next generation for the country. I wish you a happy new year!"

Subsequently, Yang Shangkun and his entourage drove to the Jiangdu Water Conservancy Hub Project, visiting officials and workers who were on duty during the holiday to ensure irrigation for the fields. He extended New Year's greetings to them.

Yang Shangkun arrived in Yangzhou on February 5 to conduct a work inspection. On the first day of the Lunar New Year, he attended the Yangzhou City Spring Festival gathering, spending the New Year with local party and government leaders and old comrades.

　　杨主席向农民拜年
    新华社记者　张行端
    农历正月初二上午，国家主席杨尚昆冒着蒙蒙细雨，来到江苏省扬州市郊农村，向农民群众拜年。
    一场春雨催绿了田野的麦苗。杨尚昆在中共江苏省委书记韩培信、省长顾秀莲和南京军区司令员向守志的陪同下，走进扬州郊区湾头乡田庄村农民李章荣的农舍。杨尚昆握着女主人高菊香的手说：“向你们拜年！”高菊香激动地向杨尚昆一行问好，并把她的小儿子拉到杨尚昆面前，要他“祝杨主席新年好！”
    杨尚昆环顾这三大间瓦屋，只见墙上贴着年画、春联，桌子上堆满了桔子、糖果，一台大彩电正在播放文艺节目，一片节日景象，高兴地说：“年货不少啊！”在堂屋坐下后，他仔细地询问了这家农户的生活情况。高菊香告诉杨尚昆，她是养猪专业户，去年共养猪１７０头，出栏１１２头，纯收入达１３０００元。
    杨尚昆问：“家里几个劳动力？”
    李章荣说：他家５口人，他在村办厂当工人，爱人在家养猪，还种了１．２亩口粮田，自己一早一晚帮爱人干点农活。老母亲负责烧饭，小儿子上学。
    杨尚昆指着女主人说：“那你家里的收入主要靠她了？”
    李章荣回答：“是啊，她在家里顶了大半边天。”
    杨尚昆一行一起笑了起来。欢声笑语使这间农舍洋溢着暖融融的春意。
    杨尚昆在主人带领下，参观了卧室和厨房。他看到厨房门口堆放着大理石块，问道：“你们准备造新屋？”
    李章荣的７６岁的老母亲在一边回答说：“准备造新楼房。”杨尚昆握着老人的手说：“你好福气啊！”老妈妈激动地说：“托共产党的福，感谢杨主席的关心！”
    杨尚昆走出农舍，拉着李章荣和高菊香的手说：“祝你们多养猪，多贡献。”又俯身对他们的小儿子说：“小朋友要好好念书。”
    杨尚昆又走到路边另一户人家，主人田家祥是农村中学的校长，爱人是小学的老师。杨尚昆高兴地说：“好啊，你们是教师之家，为国家培养下一代。我向你们拜年！”
    接着，杨尚昆一行驱车来到江都水利枢纽工程，看望在节日期间坚守岗位、为农田抗旱翻水的干部和工人，向他们致以节日的问候。
    杨尚昆是２月５日到扬州考察工作的。农历正月初一，他出席了扬州市的春节团拜会，同当地党政领导干部和老同志共度新春佳节。
