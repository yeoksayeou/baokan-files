The State Bureau of Technical Supervision will conduct quarterly product quality inspections. The pass rate for the fourth quarter of last year was 74.4 percent.

According to Xinhua News Agency, the State Bureau of Technical Supervision has recently published the results of 17 substandard products and their manufacturers based on the product quality inspection results for the fourth quarter of 1988.

The State Bureau of Technical Supervision inspected 886 enterprises' 50 categories and 1,241 types of products in the fourth quarter. The overall pass rate was 74.4 percent. Among these, large enterprises had a pass rate of 83.6 percent; medium and small enterprises had a pass rate of 71.7 percent; and township enterprises had a pass rate of 62.6 percent.

Among the 50 categories of products inspected, the pass rates for semi-trailer trucks, special steel ropes, and eight other categories were the highest, reaching 100 percent. The pass rates for cassette players, polyvinyl chloride artificial leather, pig feed, and infrared radiation coatings were the lowest, at 55.6 percent, 38.7 percent, 18.8 percent, and 14.3 percent, respectively.

Most of the samples inspected by the State Bureau of Technical Supervision each quarter are taken from the finished product warehouses or production lines of factories, with some samples taken from the market. The inspection found that most manufacturers pay attention to quality, but some have weak quality awareness and produce substandard products.

Regarding the publication of the list of substandard products, Vice Minister Li Baoguo of the State Bureau of Technical Supervision told reporters that henceforth, the list of substandard products and their manufacturers found in each quarter's inspection will be published as a regular practice. He hopes that relevant departments and technical supervision departments will work closely together. For enterprises that have obtained production permits or won quality awards but are found to have substandard products in the inspection, they must be rectified within a specified period. Those that fail to pass the re-inspection after the deadline should have their production permits revoked and their national quality awards withdrawn by relevant departments. For enterprises producing without permits, relevant departments should take decisive measures to handle them.

　　国家技术监督局将按季抽查产品质量    
    去年第四季度抽查结果合格率为百分之七十四点四
    据新华社电  国家技术监督局根据１９８８年第四季度产品质量抽查结果，近日又公布了１７个劣质产品及生产厂家。
    国家技术监督局第四季度抽查了８８６个企业的５０类１２４１种产品。总合格率为７４．４％。其中大型企业合格率为８３．６％；中小型企业合格率为７１．７％；乡镇企业合格率为６２．６％。
    抽查的５０类产品中，汽车全挂车、专用钢丝绳等８类产品合格率最高，达１００％。收录机、聚氯乙烯人造革、猪饲料、红外辐射涂料合格率最低，合格率分别为５５．６％、３８．７％、１８．８％、１４．３％。
    国家技术监督局每季度的产品质量抽查，大部分样品是到工厂的成品库或生产线上抽取的，部分样品是到市场抽取的。抽查中发现大部分厂家注意质量，但有一些厂家质量意识淡薄，生产的产品质量低劣。
    国家技术监督局副局长李保国就公布劣质产品名单一事对记者说，今后每季度公布抽查到的劣质产品及生产厂家将作为制度执行。他希望各有关部门和技术监督部门紧密配合，对已经取得生产许可证或获得质量奖，但抽查中发现不合格或生产劣质产品的企业，一定要限期整改，逾期复查不合格者，有关部门应吊销他们的生产许可证，撤销获得的国家质量奖。对无证生产企业，有关部门应采取果断措施查处。
