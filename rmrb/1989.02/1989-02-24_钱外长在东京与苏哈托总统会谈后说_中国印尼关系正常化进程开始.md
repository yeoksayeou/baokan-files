Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said today in Tokyo that the normalization of China-Indonesia relations has begun. This was after he held talks with Indonesian President Suharto and State Minister Murdiono.

Qian said in a press conference after the talks that the talks signified the beginning of the normalization process between the two countries.

The two sides exchanged views on bilateral relations and issues of common concern in a friendly atmosphere. After the talks, Qian and Indonesian State Minister Murdiono jointly met with the press and issued the following three points of consensus on the normalization of China-Indonesia relations:

1. Both sides agree to take further measures to achieve the normalization of relations;
2. The relations between the two countries should be based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Ten Principles of the Bandung Conference;
3. Both sides decide to discuss specific matters regarding the normalization of relations through their representatives to the United Nations, and if necessary, the foreign ministers of the two countries will hold meetings.

During the meeting, Qian conveyed the cordial greetings and good wishes of Chairman Yang Shangkun and Premier Li Peng to President Suharto. Suharto requested Qian to convey his greetings to Chairman Yang Shangkun and other Chinese leaders.

This was the first official talks between the two countries since diplomatic relations were severed on October 30, 1967.

Additionally, Qian met with West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher this afternoon.
