A unique series of monoclonal antibodies against gastric cancer has been developed at the Fourth Military Medical University, pushing the early diagnosis and targeted treatment of precancerous lesions in China to an advanced international level. The primary researcher, Fan Daiming, is only in his early 30s and has recently returned from studying abroad.

In recent years, the university has systematically sent 250 scientific and technical personnel to 29 countries and regions for further study, collaborative research, or to pursue doctoral degrees. To attract these individuals back to the school and utilize their talents, the university has gone to great lengths to create a good working and living environment for them. Even before the personnel studying new cell engineering technologies abroad have returned, the school has begun preparing to build a laboratory. Upon their return, these individuals immediately engage in research, and within less than a year, they have achieved results worthy of a second-class national scientific and technological progress award.

Middle-aged associate professor Cui Yunzhang, after studying at the University of London, has mastered the new technology of monoclonal antibodies. Upon his return, the school quickly provided him with technical staff and established a laboratory. After three years of intensive research, his team was the first in the country to develop a human monoclonal antibody for hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, opening up new prospects for the prevention and treatment of the disease.

In terms of talent utilization, the Fourth Military Medical University has broken away from the seniority system, encouraging returning scholars to unleash their potential, produce more results, and produce them quickly. Lecturer Hui Yinian, who conducted research on induced posterior vitreous detachment at the University of California, solved a problem that had baffled international experts for nine years in less than a year. He was once promoted to deputy director of the school's academic affairs office. To fully utilize his professional expertise, the school relieved him of his administrative duties and promoted him to associate professor, allowing him to display his talents on the front lines of teaching, medical care, and scientific research.

The Fourth Military Medical University also values the promotion of new achievements and technologies from abroad. Upon the return of personnel who have studied abroad, they promptly organize seminars or workshops on new technologies, ensuring that "one person's learning benefits everyone, and one introduction benefits multiple parties."

　　让归国学子尽可能释放能量    
    第四军医大学提供用武之地
    本报讯  一种独具特色的抗胃癌单克隆抗体系列在第四军医大学的问世，把我国癌前病变患者的早期胃癌诊断和导向治疗研究推向国际先进水平。它的主要研究者樊代明才３０出头，刚从国外学成归来不久。
    这所军医大学近些年先后有计划地派出２５０名科技人员，分赴２９个国家和地区学习深造、合作研究或攻读博士学位。为了吸引出国人员回校发挥作用，学校千方百计为他们创造良好的工作和生活环境。派出学习细胞工程新技术的人员尚未回国，校方已着手筹建实验室。归国人员一返校，即投入研究，不到一年时间，就取得获国家科技进步二等奖的研究成果。
    中年副教授崔运昌在英国伦敦大学深造后，熟练掌握了单克隆抗体这一新技术。回国后，学校迅速为他配备技术人员，建立实验室。经过３年攻关，这个研究小组在国内外首次研究出肾综合症出血热病毒人单抗，为肾综合症出血热的防治开辟了新的前景。
    在人才使用上，四医大打破论资排辈的框框，促使归国人员释放“能量”，多出成果，快出成果。惠延年讲师赴美国加州大学开展诱发眼玻璃体后脱离研究，不到一年时间就解决了国外９年未能攻克的难题。他曾被提升校教务处副处长。为了充分发挥其业务专长，学校免去他的行政职务，晋升他为副教授，以在教学、医疗、科研第一线施展才干。
    四医大还重视推广国外新成果、新技术。出国人员一返校，他们便及时组织专题讲座或新技术讲习班，使“一人学习大家受益，一家引进多家受益”。
