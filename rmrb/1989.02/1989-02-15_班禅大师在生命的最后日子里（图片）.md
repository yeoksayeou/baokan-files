The great patriot and outstanding leader of Chinese Tibetan Buddhism, Panchen Erdeni Qojue Jamphel Namgyal, dedicated his life to the unity of the motherland and the solidarity of the nation. In his final days, he personally traveled to Tibet to oversee the opening ceremony of the Panchen Eastern Tomb, where the remains of the Fifth to Ninth Panchen Lamas are interred, and to implement the Party's policies on national and religious affairs. Due to overwork and a sudden heart attack, he unfortunately passed away on January 28. On January 22, at the opening ceremony of the Panchen Eastern Tomb, Panchen Erdeni Qojue Jamphel Namgyal delivered a lengthy speech, enthusiastically praising the Chinese Communist Party's policies on national and religious affairs.
