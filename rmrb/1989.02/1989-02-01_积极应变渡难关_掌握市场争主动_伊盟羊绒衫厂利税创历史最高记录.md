One of the world's largest wool sweater factories, the Inner Mongolia Yili Alliance Wool Sweater Factory, has taken effective measures to adapt to the chaotic raw material market and changing product demand. In 1988, the factory achieved a profit and tax revenue of 55 million yuan, setting a historical high.

Last year was the most challenging year in the factory's history: the price of raw wool increased by 1.2 times compared to the same period the previous year, and the problem of adulteration was severe. Within the region, many wool processing enterprises were established, leading to an excess of processing capacity over wool production, resulting in a shortage of raw materials. The market demand for wool sweaters shifted towards small batches, multiple styles, and colors, with complex craftsmanship and high difficulty. Additionally, the installation and debugging of new equipment for 300,000 wool sweaters were urgently needed.

Faced with numerous difficulties, the factory organized a team of business elites to go out and purchase raw materials, thereby seizing the initiative in the raw material market.

The factory adheres to the policy of "two legs walking" and "domestic and international markets simultaneously" in the product market. In the international market, they maintain good business relationships with old customers while using various opportunities to attract new customers. In the domestic market, they leverage preferential policies, using Beijing as a base, to form a sales network that spans coastal regions and tourist cities, creating a market environment where demand exceeds supply, ensuring sustained sales momentum.

　　积极应变渡难关　掌握市场争主动
    伊盟羊绒衫厂利税创历史最高记录
    本报讯  记者傅旭报道：世界上最大的羊绒衫厂之一的内蒙古伊克昭盟羊绒衫厂在原料市场混乱、产品需求变化较大的情况下，积极采取有效的应变措施，１９８８年实现利税５５００万元，创历史最高记录。
    去年，是伊盟羊绒衫厂有史以来最困难的一年：原绒价格比上年同期增长１．２倍，且掺假现象严重；区内绒产品加工企业上马较多，加工能力大于原绒产量，造成原料短缺；销售市场对羊绒衫的订货日趋小批量、多款式、多花色，工艺复杂，难度大；新上３０万件羊绒衫的设备急待搬迁、安装、调试。
    面对重重困难，厂里组织了一批业务骨干外出采购原料，掌握了原料市场主动权。
    该厂在产品市场坚持两条腿走路、国内外市场并举的方针。在国际市场，他们一方面与老客户保持良好的业务联系，同时利用各种机会吸引新客户；在国内市场，他们利用优惠政策，以北京为依托，形成纵贯沿海地区与旅游城市的销售网点，创造出一个求大于供的市场环境，保证了产品销售旺势持久不衰。
