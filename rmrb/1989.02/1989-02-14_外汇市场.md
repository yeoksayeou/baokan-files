The Foreign Exchange Market

With the development of China's export-oriented economy and the expansion of import and export trade, many readers are eager to learn about the foreign exchange market, exchange rates, forward foreign exchange transactions, spot foreign exchange transactions, and other related knowledge. Here, we invite colleagues from the International Financial Research Institute of the Bank of China to provide an introduction. — Editor

The foreign exchange market is centered around foreign exchange banks and involves importers and exporters, government authorities, foreign exchange brokers, and other foreign exchange suppliers and demanders engaging in foreign exchange transactions. Unlike other securities markets and commodity markets, the objects of transactions in the foreign exchange market do not belong to the same currency, and there is no fixed location or specific opening and closing times. The parties involved in foreign exchange transactions mostly use telephones, telegrams, telexes, and other means to conduct transactions.

The organizational members of the foreign exchange market include: Chinese commercial banks that specialize in or engage in foreign exchange business, branches of foreign banks in China; foreign exchange brokers, mainly domestic financial institutions and overseas Chinese and foreign-funded banks in China. Enterprises or individuals' foreign exchange transactions must be entrusted to brokers and are not allowed to enter the market directly for trading; the central bank does not directly participate in the market but conducts transactions through brokers and commercial banks.

China established its first foreign exchange adjustment center in Shenzhen in 1986. After several years of development, more than 20 such centers have been established. Enterprises' retained foreign exchange, foreign investment foreign exchange, donated foreign exchange, and other types can all be sold in this market; enterprises can purchase foreign exchange from the market for introducing advanced equipment and technology, purchasing raw materials and components, and other uses.

Since the main purpose of establishing the foreign exchange market in China is to adjust the surplus and deficit of foreign exchange funds for domestic enterprises and institutions, the objects and varieties of transactions are not as numerous as in Western foreign exchange markets. The main currencies are the US dollar, Hong Kong dollar, and a few other foreign currencies. The parties to the transactions are mainly enterprises, and both the amount of each transaction and the total transaction volume are relatively small. However, the transaction prices adopt a method similar to Western foreign exchange markets, i.e., prices are determined based on market supply and demand, and transactions are conducted through competitive bidding and on-the-spot pricing.

　　外汇市场
    随着我国外向型经济的发展和进出口贸易的扩大，很多读者渴望了解有关外汇市场、汇率、远期外汇交易、即期外汇交易等知识。在此请中国银行国际金融研究所的同志加以介绍。——编者
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    所谓外汇市场，是以外汇银行为中心，由进出口商、政府当局、外汇经纪商以及其他外汇供需者进行外汇交易所形成的市场。与其他证券市场、商品市场不同，外汇市场上进行交易的对象不属于同一种货币，并且没有固定场所，也没有一定的开盘或收盘时间。外汇买卖的当事人大都利用电话、电报、电传等方式进行交易。
    外汇市场的组织成员包括：专营或兼营外汇业务的我国商业银行，外国银行设在我国的分支机构；外汇经纪人，主要指国内金融机构和在华的侨资、外资银行。企业或个人的外汇买卖，须委托经纪人进行，不得自己直接进入场内交易；中央银行并不直接介入市场，而是通过经纪人和商业银行进行交易。
    我国于１９８６年在深圳建立了首家外汇调剂中心，经过几年的发展，先后又成立了２０多家调剂中心。凡企业的留成外汇、外商投资的外汇、捐赠外汇等均可在这个市场出售；企业引进先进设备和技术、购买原材料和零配件等用汇，均可向市场购买。
    由于我国成立外汇市场的主要目的是调剂国内企事业单位的外汇资金余缺，因此，交易对象与品种不如西方外汇市场上那么多，主要有美元、港元等少数几种外币，成交双方主要是企业，无论是每笔交易额还是总交易量都比较小，但交易价格采取了类似西方外汇市场的做法，即根据市场供求状况确定价格，采取竞价买卖的方式，当场喊价成交。
