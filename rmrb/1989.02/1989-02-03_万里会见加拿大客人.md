Wan Li, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, met with Canadian guests this afternoon at the Great Hall of the People. He expressed his delight at the continuous development of economic and trade relations, as well as cooperation in other fields, between China and Canada.

The Chinese province of Jilin and the Canadian province of Saskatchewan established a friendly inter-provincial relationship in 1984. Wan Li told Grant Devine, Premier of Saskatchewan, who was present at the meeting, that he hopes the relationship between the two provinces will continue to develop and serve as a model for friendly cooperation between the two countries. Devine said that his province and Jilin Province have already established extensive and in-depth cooperative relations, and both sides are willing to work for the further development of this relationship.

The delegation led by Devine arrived in Beijing yesterday after visiting Jilin Province and is scheduled to return home tomorrow.
