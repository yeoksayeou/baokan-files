The Polish United Workers' Party held a theoretical discussion meeting to summarize the seven years of economic and political reform practices. General Secretary Jaruzelski emphasized the need to combine reform theory with the basic principles of socialism.

	New China News Agency, Warsaw, February 2 — Polish United Workers' Party Central Committee First Secretary Jaruzelski urged party theorists to combine reform ideas with the defense of basic socialist principles when exploring reform theories.

	He made the above remarks in his opening speech at the opening of the third national theoretical and ideological meeting of the Polish United Workers' Party today.

	The third theoretical and ideological meeting, which opened today, will summarize the seven years of economic and political reform practices in Poland, find the laws governing them, and guide future reforms. When discussing how to evaluate the previous stage of reform, Jaruzelski said that the evaluation should be objective, "neither beautifying nor vilifying."

	He said that in theoretical discussions, doubts are allowed, but doubts are not for complete negation, but to break through ideological shackles and improve the ability to explain things as they are. He hopes that theorists will give practical answers to new problems that arise in the reform.

	Jaruzelski also pointed out in his speech that in the past, "class struggle was simplified and absolutized." Today, the struggle "has not disappeared," it has only changed its form.

　　雅鲁泽尔斯基强调改革理论与社会主义原则相结合
    新华社华沙２月２日电  波兰统一工人党中央第一书记雅鲁泽尔斯基要求党的理论工作者在探索改革理论时把改革思想同捍卫社会主义的基本原则结合起来。
    他是在今天开幕的波兰统一工人党第３次全国理论意识形态会议上致开幕词时作上述表示的。
    今天开幕的第３次理论意识形态会议将总结波兰７年来经济和政治改革的实践，找出规律性的东西，以指导今后的改革。在谈到如何评价前一阶段改革时，雅鲁泽尔斯基表示，要实事求是地进行评价，“既不美化，也不丑化”。
    他说，在理论上进行探讨时允许怀疑，但怀疑不是为了全盘否定，而是为了摆脱思想上的束缚，提高实事求是地解释事物本来面目的能力。他希望理论工作者对改革中出现的新问题作出符合实际的回答。
    雅鲁泽尔斯基在讲话中还指出，过去把“阶级斗争简单化和绝对化了”，今天斗争“并没有消失”，只不过斗争的形式改变了。
