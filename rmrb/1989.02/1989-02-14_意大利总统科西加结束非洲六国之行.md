Italian President Francesco Cossiga concluded his visit to six African countries—Egypt, Kenya, Zambia, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, and Somalia—from February 5 to 10. During his visit, Cossiga held extensive discussions with the leaders of these six countries on issues such as Middle East peace, opposition to apartheid, and strengthening South-North cooperation.

According to Foreign Minister Andreotti, who accompanied Cossiga on his visit, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak expressed "cautious optimism" about the progress made in the "new approach" following the dialogue between the United States and the PLO. Egypt hopes that Italy and other European Community countries will "persuade" the United States and Israel, while Egypt continues to work on improving relations with Arab countries. Italy and Egypt share a common view on convening an international peace conference for the Middle East.

An important topic in Cossiga's discussions with the leaders of southern African countries was opposition to apartheid. Cossiga stated, "Apartheid is an unjust system that is also dangerous for whites. The white people of South Africa should realize this. Equality and freedom represent the future." The leaders of the relevant African countries hope that Italy will take "necessary punitive actions" against South Africa.

The six countries visited by Cossiga are among those that have received the most aid from Italy. During his visit, Cossiga repeatedly emphasized that Europeans should always remember everything that Africa has given to Europe. Aiding African countries is a "moral obligation and a politically wise action." The concept of aid should be transformed into a genuine cooperation, allowing the entire Third World to fully leverage its potential human and material resources.

Local media pointed out that Cossiga is the first Italian president to visit Africa. This visit is a significant diplomatic activity for Italy in 1989 and will help Italy and African countries develop political and economic cooperation.

　　意大利总统科西加结束非洲六国之行
    本报罗马２月１１日电  记者史克栋报道：意大利总统科西加于２月５日至１０日访问了埃及、肯尼亚、赞比亚、莫桑比克、津巴布韦、索马里非洲六国，访问期间，科西加和六国首脑就中东和平、反对种族隔离政策、加强南北合作等问题进行了广泛的交谈。
    据陪同科西加出访的安德烈奥蒂外长向记者透露，埃及总统穆巴拉克在会谈中对于美国与巴解组织对话以来“新的路线”的进展表示“谨慎的乐观”。埃及希望意大利与欧共体其它国家对美国和以色列进行“说服”工作，埃及则继续努力，搞好与阿拉伯国家的关系。意大利和埃及在召开中东国际和平会议上有着一致的看法。
    科西加总统与南部非洲国家领导人会谈的一个重要内容是反对种族隔离政策，科西加说：“种族隔离政策是一种非正义的制度，对于白人本身也是危险的。南非的白人应该清醒地认识到这一点。平等、自由才能代表未来。”非洲有关国家的领导人希望意大利对南非采取“必要的制裁行动”。
    此次科西加总统访问的六国是接受意大利援助较多的国家。访问期间，科西加多次强调，欧洲人应该时刻记着非洲所给予欧洲的一切。援助非洲国家是“道德上的义务和政治上的明智行动”。应该把援助上的给予与接受的观念改变为一种真诚的合作，使整个第三世界能充分发挥自己的人力和物力资源的潜在优势。
    此间舆论指出，科西加是第一位出访非洲的意大利总统，这次访问是意大利今年的一次重要外交活动，有助于意大利和非洲国家发展政治、经济合作关系。
