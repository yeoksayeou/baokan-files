	South Provides Low-Interest Loans to Support Underdeveloped Regions
	Xinhua News Agency, Belgrade, February 14 — (Reporter Xú Kùnmíng) Over the past 22 years, the Yugoslav Federal Government has provided a total of 2.7 trillion dinars in long-term, low-interest loans to underdeveloped regions. According to the exchange rate at that time, this amounts to 10.1 billion U.S. dollars.

	Yugoslavia is a federal country composed of 6 republics and 2 autonomous provinces. Among them, the Kosovo Autonomous Province is the least developed economically. Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia, and Montenegro are also underdeveloped regions. These underdeveloped regions account for 2/5 of the country's total area and approximately 1/3 of the total population, but their social output value is only 1/5 of the country's total social output value.

	The Yugoslav party and government leaders have always attached great importance to accelerating the economic development of underdeveloped regions, believing that this is an important factor in demonstrating national equality and strengthening national unity. Initially, the federal government increased investment in underdeveloped regions through five-year plans. Starting in 1966, the Federal Fund for Accelerated Development of Underdeveloped Regions was established, using long-term, low-interest loans to support the economic construction of underdeveloped regions.

	These loans have, to some extent, promoted the economic development of underdeveloped regions.

　　加速经济平衡发展　促进民族之间团结   
    南提供低息贷款支援不发达地区
    新华社贝尔格莱德２月１４日电  （记者徐坤明）南斯拉夫联邦为加速国内不发达地区的发展，２２年来总共向不发达地区提供了长期低息贷款２．７万亿第纳尔，按照当年比价计算，折合１０１亿美元。
    南斯拉夫是由６个共和国和２个自治省组成的联邦制国家。其中科索沃自治省经济最不发达。波斯尼亚和黑塞哥维那、马其顿、黑山３个共和国也属不发达地区。这些不发达地区的面积占全国总面积的２／５，人口约占全国总人口的１／３，但其社会产值仅占全国社会产值的１／５。
    南斯拉夫党政领导一直很重视加速不发达地区的经济发展问题，认为这是体现民族平等和加强民族团结的重要因素。最初联邦政府通过五年计划来增加对不发达地区的投资，１９６６年起建立了联邦加速发展不发达地区信贷基金，用长期低息贷款来支援不发达地区的经济建设。
    这些贷款在一定程度上促进了不发达地区的经济发展。
