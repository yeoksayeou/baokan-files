Taiwan's education authorities have rejected an application from the Taiwan Gymnastics Association to participate in the Asian Youth Gymnastics Championships to be held in Beijing. This decision has sparked dissatisfaction among the Taiwanese public.

The Asian Youth Gymnastics Championships are scheduled to take place in late April in Beijing, with the registration deadline set for March 10. On February 13, the Taipei Olympic Committee approved the application from the "Taiwan Gymnastics Association" to participate in the competition and forwarded the application to the Taiwan "Ministry of Education" for review. On February 14, Zhang Ziman, the director of the Sports Bureau of the Ministry of Education, called Li Qinghua, the secretary-general of the Taipei Olympic Committee, stating that the mainland's attitude towards the naming issue for Taiwanese athletes participating in competitions on the mainland was unclear. Therefore, the application from the "Taiwan Gymnastics Association" was returned for further deliberation.

Taiwanese newspapers pointed out that the so-called unclear attitude from the mainland refers to the issue of the Chinese translation of "Chinese Taipei."

On February 14, Yu Meili, the general secretary of the Taiwan Gymnastics Association, expressed her confusion, noting that Zhang Fengxu, the chairman of the Taipei Olympic Committee, had previously stated at an Olympic Committee meeting that a guarantee letter from the Asian Gymnastics Union would be sufficient. She questioned why a guarantee letter from the mainland was now required.

It is reported that this year, there are 10 international sports competitions to be held on the mainland that meet the conditions set by the Taiwanese authorities, allowing Taiwanese athletes to participate. The application by the Taiwan Gymnastics Association to compete on the mainland was the first to be approved by the Taipei Olympic Committee, but it was rejected by the Taiwan "Ministry of Education." The Taiwan "China Times" stated that this casts a shadow over the future of sports exchanges across the Taiwan Strait.

### 台湾教育当局退回体操协会赴大陆参赛申请

　　台湾教育当局退回体操协会赴大陆参赛申请
    中新社香港２月１６日电  台北消息：主管台湾体育事务的台湾“教育部”１４日退回“台湾体操协会”参加将在北京举行的亚洲青年体操锦标赛的申请，此举引起台湾舆论的不满。
    亚洲青年体操锦标赛定于４月下旬在北京举行，报名截止日期是３月１０日。２月１３日，台北奥委会审查通过了“台湾体协”参加该项比赛的申请，并将申请送台湾“教育部”审核。２月１４日“教育部体育司司长”张至满打电话给台北奥委会秘书长李庆华，认为大陆对台湾运动员赴大陆参加比赛使用的名称问题所持态度不明确，退回“台湾体协”的申请，再作研议。
    台湾报纸指出，所谓大陆方面的态度不明确，乃指“Ｃｈｉｎｅｓｅ　Ｔａｉｐｅｉ”的中文译名问题。
    台湾体操协会总干事余美丽１４日说，令人不解的是台北奥委会主席张丰绪在前不久的奥委会委员大会上，曾亲口答复体协理事长庄秀石，只要亚洲体操联合会的保证书即可，为什么现在又要大陆方面的保证书？
    据悉，今年在大陆举行的一系列国际性体育比赛中，有１０项比赛符合台湾当局规定的条件，可使台湾运动员参加。台湾体操协会申请赴大陆参赛案，是台北奥委会审查通过的首件申请，但都被台湾“教育部”打了回票。台湾《中国时报》说，这给海峡两岸体育交流的未来蒙上了一层阴影。
