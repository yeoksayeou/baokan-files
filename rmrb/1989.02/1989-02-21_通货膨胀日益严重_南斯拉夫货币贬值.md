	Severe Inflation Leads to Devaluation of Yugoslav Currency
	Xinhua News Agency, Belgrade, February 19 (Reporter Xu Kunming)

	Due to worsening inflation, the Yugoslav currency, the dinar, has significantly depreciated.

	Yugoslav National Bank Governor Vlatkovic today announced in a statement to the Yugoslav News Agency that from the beginning of 1988 to the end of the year, various convertible currencies appreciated by an average of 293% against the dinar. According to recent reports from the "Courier" newspaper, from January 1 to February 15 this year, 15 types of convertible currencies appreciated by an average of 19% against the dinar.

	From official statistics, the dinar's depreciation rate against convertible currencies has been increasing in recent years. In 1981, it was 21%, in 1984 it was 50%, and in 1987 it was 200%.

	At the end of 1981, 1 US dollar could be exchanged for 41.8 dinars, but now it can be exchanged for 6,395.7 dinars. Compared to the US dollar, the dinar's value is now only 1/153 of what it was seven years ago.

	Due to soaring prices and continuous currency depreciation, the Yugoslav National Bank is preparing to issue banknotes with a face value of 100,000 dinars.

	Meanwhile, the financial sector is considering whether a currency reform is necessary. One opinion is that a new currency should be issued with an exchange rate of 1 new dinar to 1,000 old dinars. Another opinion is that the immediate task is to control inflation, otherwise, the new currency will also depreciate significantly.

### 通货膨胀日益严重  南斯拉夫货币贬值

　　通货膨胀日益严重
    南斯拉夫货币贬值
    新华社贝尔格莱德２月１９日电  （记者徐坤明）由于通货膨胀日益严重，南斯拉夫货币第纳尔大幅度贬值。
    南斯拉夫人民银行行长弗拉特科维奇今天在向南通社发表谈话时宣布，１９８８年从年初到年底，各种可兑换外汇与第纳尔相比平均增值２９３％。据《信使报》最近报道，从今年１月１日至２月１５日，１５种可兑换外汇又比第纳尔平均增值１９％。
    从南官方统计看，与可兑换外汇相比，最近几年第纳尔的贬值幅度越来越大。１９８１年为２１％，１９８４年为５０％，１９８７年为２００％。
    １９８１年底１美元只能兑换４１．８第纳尔，而今天已能兑换６３９５．７第纳尔。与美元相比，现在第纳尔的价值仅相当于７年前的１／１５３。
    由于物价猛涨、货币不断贬值，南人民银行即将发行面额为１０万第纳尔的钞票。
    同时，南金融界正在酝酿是否需要实行币制改革的问题。一种意见是，应该发行新货币，比价是：１新第纳尔兑换１０００旧第纳尔。另一种意见认为，当务之急是抑制通货膨胀，否则，货币也会大幅度贬值。
