Fish Eyes Mixed with Pearls, Mud and Sand Together
Nanjing Cracks Down on "Human Body Art Exhibitions"

Reported by Gong Yongquan: The news that the "Oil Painting Human Body Art Grand Exhibition" in Beijing attracted over 200,000 visitors spread quickly, and suddenly, Nanjing saw the emergence of 7 "Human Body Art Exhibitions." Apart from one exhibition whose works were created by students, teachers, and some artists from university art departments, the rest were all pieced together using various photographs or collages from albums. These photographs included familiar foreign classical paintings, modern nude paintings, and photographs of people wearing bikinis.

These exhibitions generally lacked artistic knowledge introductions, prefaces, or concluding remarks. Some visitors asked, "From which side should I start viewing?" The staff either smiled and replied, "You can view it randomly," or simply said, "You can start from wherever you like."

Even more discordant was that some exhibitions occasionally played videos about human body mysteries, introducing the functions of various human body organs and the mating and reproductive physiological phenomena of humans and other animals.

The media in the Nanjing region exposed this issue. The relevant departments of the city took it seriously and recently issued regulations: Human body art exhibitions and similar exhibitions will be included in the cultural market management scope. The organizing units need to apply to the district/county cultural market management departments, and after passing the review, a temporary permit will be issued. Artistic evaluations will be strengthened to guide and improve the audience's artistic appreciation level. Works from human body paintings and photographs that are designated by national publishing departments for internal circulation or overseas circulation only, shall not be publicly exhibited in any disguised form. It is strictly forbidden to mix human body art with sex knowledge exhibitions.

Currently, all human body art exhibitions in the city have been temporarily suspended for rectification.

### 鱼目混珠　泥沙俱下  南京市整顿“人体艺术展”

　　鱼目混珠　泥沙俱下
    南京市整顿“人体艺术展”
    本报讯  记者龚永泉报道：北京“油画人体艺术大展”观众超过２０万人次的消息传来，南京一下子冒出了７个“人体艺术展”，除一处的展品是出自高校美术系学生、教师和一些画家之手外，其余的都是用各种图片或剪贴画册拼凑起来的。这些图片有的是人们较熟悉的外国古典名画，有的是现代的裸体画，有的则是身着比基尼泳装的照片。
    这些展览大都没有艺术知识介绍，没有“前言”和“结束语”，有的观众问：“从哪边开始看？”工作人员或笑着回答“随便参观”；或者干脆说：“你想从哪边看就从哪边看。”
    特别不和谐的是，有的展览还不时播放有关人体奥秘的录相，介绍人体各部器官功能以及包括人在内的各种动物的求偶、生殖等生理现象。
    南京地区新闻舆论对此进行曝光。市有关部门颇为重视，近日作出规定：将人体艺术展览及类似性质的展览纳入文化市场管理范围，主办单位需向区县文化市场管理部门提出申请，经审查合格后颁发临时许可证；要加强艺术评点工作，以引导和提高观众的艺术欣赏水平；凡国家出版部门确定为内部发行或只向海外发行的人体绘画、摄影图片中的作品，一律不得变相公开展出；严禁将人体艺术与性知识展览混合展出。
    目前，全市人体艺术展已全部暂停营业，进行整顿。
