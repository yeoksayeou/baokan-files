Funds, raw materials, energy, and transportation are currently common challenges faced by enterprises. How can enterprises align self-adjustment with national macro-control? Jinan Light Horse Motorcycle Factory relies on tapping internal potential, strictly managing internal finances, digesting various factors that reduce profits, and investing limited funds into marketable products, achieving noticeable results.

Jinan Light Horse Motorcycle Factory is a major backbone enterprise in China's motorcycle industry. Last year, it produced 120,000 motorcycles of various models. To digest the factors of rising raw material prices, they adjusted the product structure, effectively controlling the consumption of raw materials and accelerating the turnover of funds. The utilization rate of steel in the enterprise increased from 62% last year to 70%. According to the technical standards of imported aluminum, they organized the production of 600 tons of the same type of aluminum domestically, saving the enterprise 300 million yuan in expenditure. In 1988, the factory digested various factors of rising prices, amounting to over 20 million yuan.

To address the shortage of funds, the factory has strengthened the enterprise's financial management system. First, they strengthened internal basic management, rectified and improved various ledgers and reports; second, they broke down the 60 million yuan increase in revenue and savings target set at the beginning of the year, implementing it step by step; third, they strengthened cost accounting, reasonably determined the matching prices of products, and controlled the increase in costs; fourth, they established a strict approval system for non-production expenditures, reducing expenditure. After implementing these measures, the reduction in product unit costs alone increased the enterprise's benefits by 15.6 million yuan.

This year, Jinan Light Horse Motorcycle Factory continues to focus on increasing revenue and savings, tapping internal potential as the key to the enterprise's work. Currently, all employees of the factory are participating in a competition to save 1,000 yuan each.

　　济南轻骑总厂靠内部挖潜增加效益
　　去年消化各种涨价因素达２０００多万元
    本报讯  资金、原材料、能源和运输紧张，是目前企业所遇到的共同难题。企业如何使自我调整与国家宏观调控相适应？济南轻骑摩托车总厂依靠挖掘企业内部潜力，严格内部财务管理，消化各种减利因素，把有限的资金投入到适销对路的商品上，取得明显效果。
    济南轻骑摩托车总厂是我国摩托车行业的大型骨干企业，去年生产各种型号的摩托车１２万辆。为了消化原材料涨价因素，他们对产品结构进行了调整，有效地控制了原材料消耗，加快了资金周转。企业钢材的利用率由上年的６２％提高到７０％。他们按照进口铝的技术指标，在国内组织生产同型铝材６００多吨，仅此一项就为企业节省开支３００多万元。１９８８年，这个厂共消化各种涨价因素达２０００多万元。
    为解决资金不足的困难，这个厂切实加强了企业的财务管理制度。一是强化内部基础管理，整顿完善各种台帐报表；二是将年初制定的６００万元增收节支指标层层分解，逐级落实；三是加强成本核算，合理核定产品配套价格，控制成本上涨幅度；四是制定严格的非生产性开支审批制度，减少费用支出。实行这些措施后，仅产品单位成本减少一项为企业增加效益１５６万元。
    今年，济南轻骑摩托车总厂继续把增收节支、内部挖潜作为企业的工作重点来抓。目前，全厂干部职工正开展每人节约１０００元的夺标竞赛活动。
