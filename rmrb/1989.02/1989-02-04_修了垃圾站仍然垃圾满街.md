Behind the Beijing Hotel, there is a narrow alley that can only accommodate one vehicle at a time. This alley is infamous as the "garbage street" in the neighborhood. Both nearby restaurants, schools, and residents dump their garbage here, often stretching for dozens of meters, leaving only a narrow path for pedestrians. Vehicles have to take detours. In the summer, the stench is overpowering, and flies swarm; in the winter, the trash blows around with the wind.

Over the past few years, residents nearby have repeatedly called and written letters to demand a solution. Last year, thanks to the attention of Beijing municipal leaders, officials were sent to inspect the site and decided to build a closed garbage station along the road. Residents praised the city for doing a great deed for them.

Construction of the new garbage station began last January, costing approximately 200,000 yuan and taking about ten months to complete. The finished structure is 8 meters high and 15 meters long. People eagerly awaited the opening of this hard-won garbage station to transform the appearance of "garbage street." However, three months have passed, and the garbage station remains closed. Residents are puzzled and wonder what issues have arisen this time?

### 修了垃圾站仍然垃圾满街

　　修了垃圾站仍然垃圾满街
    编辑同志：
    北京建国饭店后门有一条仅能容一辆车通过的狭巷，是这个居民区有名的“垃圾街”。因为附近饭店、学校、居民均将垃圾倾倒于此，经常是绵延数十米，中间只留下行人的通道，汽车必须绕行。夏天，臭味扑鼻，苍蝇成群；冬天，废弃物随风飞舞。
    几年来，附近居民不断打电话、写信，要求解决问题。去年，承蒙北京市领导关心，派人到实地察看，并作出决定在路边建一座封闭式垃圾站，居民称赞市里为这里的居民做了一件大好事。
    新式垃圾站从去年年初动工，耗资约２０万元，历时约十个月，一座高８米、长１５米的建筑终于落成。人们期待这座来之不易的垃圾站早日启用，以改变“垃圾街”的旧貌。谁知，三个月过去了，垃圾站始终大门紧闭，居民们纳闷不解，这里边究竟又发生了什么问题？
