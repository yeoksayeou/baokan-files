Currently, a new form of tourism—labor tourism—has emerged. Labor tourism refers to tourists who, while traveling, engage in a certain amount of labor at their destination. This not only compensates for insufficient travel funds but also allows them to extend their travel time. Additionally, by participating in labor, tourists can come into contact with the lower levels of society, thereby gaining a deeper understanding of the local customs and culture. This type of tourism is particularly popular among young people who have limited economic means but still want to see more of the world.

Labor tourism originated in Western Europe and has recently become popular in countries such as Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. Countries that develop tourism often have work introduction centers that arrange accommodations and find jobs for young people who come for labor tourism.

　　劳务旅游
    目前，一种新型的旅游形式——劳务旅游已应运而生。所谓劳务旅游，是指旅游者在旅游地付出一定劳动，既弥补旅费不足，又可以延长旅游时间；同时通过参加劳动来接触社会底层，从而可以更加深入地了解当地的风土人情。这种旅游特别受到经济能力有限而又想多饱眼福的青年人的青睐。
    劳务旅游始于西欧，近年盛行于日本、澳大利亚、新西兰、加拿大等国。开展旅游业务的国家一般都设有工作介绍中心，为前来劳务旅游的青年人安排住宿和联系工作。
