Why is student thought work in universities so difficult? Some university leaders reflect on themselves:

    - Have we grasped the pulse of the students?
    - Have we solved the problems we can solve?
    - How many issues have we clarified in our situation reports?
    - Have we established institutional constraints and management?

Methods matter, but changing them is not easy.

The call for "student thought work is difficult" has been heard repeatedly.

However, whether it is revolutionary leaders or wise men, all have repeatedly stated: Youth is where hope lies! Various opinion polls also show that the proportion of contemporary university students supporting reform is quite high.

So, where does the "difficulty" come from?

After discussing with some university party and administrative cadres, many comrades calmly reflect and introspect, surprisingly coming to the conclusion that "it's not entirely the students' fault, the problem also lies within ourselves."

Where does the "problem" lie?

	How to turn "resistance" into "compliance"

Cupid's arrow flies through the campus. Nowadays, in university campuses, couples holding hands and walking together are everywhere, and unmarried pregnancies are no longer big news. Each school has measures to restrict this, but why are they not effective?

The "business fever" and "disdain for learning" have both risen in the campus, making university leaders worried and wise men heartbroken. Many schools have taken measures to "suppress business and encourage learning," but why are the effects not obvious?

"Toilet literature" and "desk literature" have become an embarrassing "sight" on campus, despite repeated bans, why do they not stop?

In recent years, every time there are youth festivals and school anniversaries, all aspects of the school worry, fearing that something might happen among the students. The party secretary of a certain university said: "What should be a memorable day has now almost become a day to be avoided."

Some say this is the contemporary university students' rebellious psychology: the more you manage, the more they resist; the more you prevent, the more they cause trouble. However, why does this rebellious psychology appear? How to turn the "resistance" in thought work into "compliance"? This is a major difficulty that current university thought work urgently needs to solve.

The deputy secretary of the Party Committee of Harbin Institute of Technology, Lu Zhenhuan, believes that there is a problem with the starting point of the work: "If thought work is done to prevent students from causing trouble, if it is not done in a harmonious atmosphere, can this thought work be effective?" He believes that the thought situation of university students should be scientifically analyzed. Their mainstream is to love the motherland, support reform, and strive for progress, but they lack social experience, are one-sided in their views, and easily influenced by external factors. Working with them can only be done through equal dialogue, guiding and leading them on the basis of trust. If you stand in a position opposite to them, how can thought work not be difficult?

	How to turn "emptiness" into "reality"

In recent years, thought work in universities has indeed become more difficult. When the "business wind" blows in society, how can the walls of the university be the only ones to block the "wind"? When moral chaos appears in society, how can universities be a pure land?

However, universities are places to cultivate youth, and youth are our future. People also require university leaders and teachers to shape the next generation of the motherland. This is both the glory and the difficulty of university thought work.

In recent years, doing thought work for students, speaking general principles often does not work, because the problems students face are often "real." For example, the difficulty of job placement after graduation is not something that can be easily solved by reasoning, the only way is to honestly tell students about the hopes, difficulties, and current situation of the reform.

In recent years, some universities have often caused some disturbances due to poor cafeteria food and poor school security. The way to prevent incidents is also to honestly explain to the students. Jiamusi Normal College, with more than 3,000 students, has only one small cafeteria, and most students eat meals they bring back to their dormitories all year round. The school explained the difficulties to the students, and no one complained. Since winter, due to power shortages, the school invited the director of the municipal power bureau to "explain" to the students, and the students also understood.

From this, it can be seen that thought work should strive to be "real." If it is "real," some conflicts may not escalate, and even if some thought problems arise, they will not be difficult to solve.

	How to turn "distant" into "close"

Some thought workers seem to have become accustomed to being "high and mighty" in front of students, putting on airs: I am the educator, you are the one being educated, I speak and you listen, I "hit" and you "pass." Once they speak and are not listened to, "hit" and do not "pass," they sigh: "University student thought work is too difficult!"

Some university leaders analyze that the current situation is indeed very different from the 1950s and 1960s. At that time, party and government cadres often gave situation reports, and students also liked to listen. If the same method is used now, the effect will definitely be greatly reduced. This is because, on the one hand, the situation is much more complex than before, and many problems that cannot be explained at the moment have appeared; on the other hand, students no longer blindly follow, like to think, and are informed, knowing as much as the leaders. This is undoubtedly progress. In this situation, putting down airs and communicating with students equally, conducting two-way exchanges of thoughts and feelings, becomes both practical and urgent.

Putting down airs, the requirements for thought workers are higher. The president of Northeast Agricultural College, Shi Bohong, said he always thinks about this question: How to give students something useful for life in four years, this not only includes knowledge, but more importantly, in terms of thought, they can consciously think about contributing to the rejuvenation of China. In this sense, without real skills and good ideological qualities, it is indeed difficult to do student thought work well.

There are also some "airs" that should be put down, such as thought work always wants to defend mistakes in work; again, university student thought work is too closely tied to the national situation, losing its own characteristics, etc. The questions raised by university leaders about themselves are indeed worth considering.

	It might be worth changing the approach

The poor effect of university student thought work is not unrelated to our "old thinking." The president of Harbin Institute of Technology, Yang Shiqin, proposed, can we change our approach and explore some new paths suitable for the new situation?

His answer is affirmative. He said, we have introduced a competitive mechanism in the cultivation of graduate students, implementing a screening system, with a screening ratio of 10%. This has smashed the "iron rice bowl" of graduate students—don't think that just because you are admitted to graduate school, you are in the "safe box," if you don't study hard, you will still be eliminated. This system has been implemented for two years, and the effect is very good, the self-awareness of graduate students in learning has greatly improved.

He also said, we have set up a branch school in Weihai, Shandong, and the students we recruit are no longer fully covered by the state, but they have to pay part of the tuition themselves. This makes students feel that learning is not easy, and everyone studies very hard. We thus imagine that in the future, the loan system for studying will be implemented, the funds will be repaid by students after they graduate and find work, putting "pressure" on students, forcing them to cherish the opportunity to learn and study hard.

Yang Shiqin also said, exam cheating is a headache for the school. We consider that for students who cheat, not only will they not get points, but it will also be recorded in their files, affecting their future job placement. Implementing such a system can suppress students' thoughts of cheating.

There is also the opening of "psychological counseling." Yang Shiqin said, some students have shown some behaviors, and according to the usual thinking, it is a "thought problem," but if analyzed according to "student psychology," it may be some "pathological reflections" of physiology or psychology. For example, a student was in low spirits, and the party branch secretary of the department found out through psychological counseling that the reason for his "thought problem" was frequent nocturnal emissions. The secretary explained to him and even bought medicine for him. Treating the symptoms, the medicine works, and this student's "problem" was solved.

Yang Shiqin summed up: "Relying on reasonable and relatively stable systems to manage and constrain is also an essential part of thought work. However, for a long time, we have neglected system building and are used to doing thought work through 'talks' and 'learning documents,' which makes it monotonous and powerless. From the development trend, system building will become more and more important."

Yang Shiqin's "new thinking" is enlightening. Some enlightened people among university party and administrative cadres are worried that "those who change their thinking" are still few, and many are still constrained by "old thinking," resulting in the poor effect of university student thought work, but they do not reflect on themselves and instead blame university students.

It seems that to improve university student thought work, some outdated "thinking" of university cadres indeed needs to be changed.

### 方法对头难变易

    大学生思想工作为何难做？高校一些领导反躬自问：
    ●是否把握住学生的脉搏　●能解决的问题解决没有
    ●形势报告讲清多少问题　●制度约束管理建立与否
    方法对头难变易
    “大学生思想工作难做”的呼声，不断传来。
    然而，无论是革命导师，还是仁人志士，无不断言：青年——希望之所在！各种“民意测验”又表明，当代大学生支持改革的比例相当之高。
    那么，“难”从何来？
    和一些高校的党政干部探讨，不少同志冷静思索，反省自己，出乎意料地得出了“不能全怪学生，原委也在自身”的结论。
    “原委”在哪里呢？
    　　　　如何由“逆”变“顺”
    丘比特之箭在校园穿行。如今的大学校园里，成双成对、勾臂搂腰出入的比比皆是，未婚先孕的也不再是什么特大新闻。各校都有这方面的约束措施，但为何收效不大？
    “经商热”与“厌学风”同时在校园兴起，高校领导忧心忡忡，有识之士痛心疾首。许多学校采取措施“抑商劝学”，但为何效果不甚明显？
    “厕所文学”和“课桌文学”成为校园里令人难堪的一“景”，虽屡禁却为何不止？
    这些年每逢青年的节日和校庆活动，学校方方面面就担忧起来，担心学生中可能会出点什么乱子。某大学党委书记说：“明明是值得纪念的日子，现在快成忌日了。”
    有人说这就是当代大学生的逆反心理：你越管，他越不服；你越防范，他越出事。然而为什么会出现这种逆反心理？如何把思想工作中的“逆”变成“顺”？是当前高校思想工作急待解决的一大难题。
    哈尔滨工业大学党委副书记卢振环认为，这里有一个工作的出发点问题：“如果做思想工作是为了学生不出事，如果不是在融洽的气氛中做学生的思想工作，这思想工作能做好吗？”他认为，对大学生的思想状况应该有一个科学的分析，他们的主流是热爱祖国、拥护改革、奋发向上的，但他们涉世未深，缺乏社会生活的经验，看问题时有片面，处理问题容易偏激，容易受外界的影响。做他们的工作，只能是平等对话，在信赖的基点上疏导和引导。如果站在同他们对立的位置上，思想工作怎么会不难做呢？
    　　　　如何由“虚”变“实”
    这几年，高校的思想工作确实越来越难做。当社会上刮起“经商风”的时候，怎么能要求大学的院墙成为唯一能挡“风”的墙呢？当社会上出现道德混乱的时候，怎么能要求高校是一片净土呢？
    然而，高校是培养青年的，青年是我们的未来，人们又要求大学领导和教师塑造好祖国的下一代。这正是高校思想工作的光荣之处与困难之处。
    这几年，做学生的思想工作，讲一般性的道理往往很难奏效，因为学生面临的问题往往很“实”。例如学生毕业分配择业难，就不是讲道理能简单解决的，唯一的办法是把改革的希望、改革的困难、目前的情况向学生实事求是地讲清楚。
    近些年有些高校常常因食堂伙食差、学校治安不好而引发一些风波。防止闹事的办法也只有实事求是向学生解释清楚。拥有３０００余名学生的佳木斯师范专科学校，只有一个不大的食堂，多数学生一年四季打了饭菜端回宿舍吃。学校向学生讲清困难，没人为此提意见。入冬以来，电力不足，学校把市电业局长请来向学生“交底”，学生也就理解了。
    由此看来，思想工作还要力求做“实”。“实”了，有些矛盾恐怕就不会激化，即使产生一些思想问题，也不难解决。
    　　　　如何由“远”变“近”
    有些思想工作者似乎习惯了，他们在学生面前总是“居高临下”，端起架子：我是教育者，你是被教育者，我讲你就要听，我“打”你就要“通”。一旦讲而不听，“打”而不“通”，他们便哀叹：“大学生思想工作太难做了！”
    一些大学负责人分析，现在的情况和五六十年代确有很大的不同。那时，党政干部经常作形势报告，学生也爱听。现在若再如法炮制，效果肯定要大打折扣。这是因为，一方面情况比过去复杂多了，出现了许多一时还说不清楚的问题；另一方面，学生不再盲从，爱动脑筋思考，信息也灵，知道的东西不比当领导的少。这无疑是时代的进步。在这种情况下，放下架子，和学生平等地沟通思想感情，进行双向交流，就显得既实际，又迫切了。
    放下架子，对思想工作者的要求更高了。东北农学院院长史伯鸿说他总在考虑这样一个问题：怎样在４年当中，给学生一辈子受用的东西，这不仅包括知识，更重要的是思想上能自觉地想到为振兴中华贡献力量。从这个意义上讲，没有真本事，没有良好的思想素质，要想做好学生思想工作，确实是困难的。
    还有一些“架子”是否也应该放下呢？比如，思想工作总想为工作中的失误辩解；再如，大学生思想工作跟全国的形势太紧，失去了自身特点，等等。大学负责人向自身提出的这些问题，确实值得思考。
    　　　　不妨换换思路
    大学生思想工作效果不佳和我们做工作的“思路老化”不无关系。哈工大校长杨士勤提出，能不能换换思路，探索一些适应新情况的新路子？
    他的回答是肯定的。他说，我们在培养研究生中引进竞争机制，实行筛选制，规定１０％的筛选比例。这就砸了研究生的“铁饭碗”——别以为考上研究生就进“保险箱”了，不努力学习，照样要被淘汰。这制度实行两年，效果很好，研究生学习自觉性大大提高。
    他还说，我们在山东威海设了一个分校，招收的学生不再由国家包下来，而是要自己付一部分学费。这就使学生感到学习不容易，一个个学习都很努力。我们由此设想，以后实施贷款上学制度，款项由学生毕业工作后归还，给学生“施加”压力，迫使他们珍惜学习机会，努力学习知识。
    杨士勤还说，考试作弊是学校头痛的问题。我们考虑对作弊的学生不仅不给分，还要记到档案里，以影响他今后的毕业分配。实行这样的制度，以抑制学生作弊的念头。
    还有开展“心理咨询”。杨士勤说，有些学生流露出了一些言行，按习惯思路就是“思想问题”了，如按照“学生心理学”来分析，很可能是生理上或心理上的一些“病态反映”。比如，有个学生情绪低落，系党总支书记通过心理咨询，知道他产生“思想问题”的原因是经常遗精。那位书记向他作了解释，还买药送给他。对症下药，药到病除，这个学生的“问题”就解决了。
    杨士勤归结说：“靠合理的、相对稳定的制度来管理，来约束，也是思想工作题中应有之义。然而长期以来，我们忽视制度建设，习惯于靠‘谈话’、靠‘学文件’这一套来做思想工作，就显得单调而又乏力了。从发展趋势来看，制度建设将越来越重要。”
    杨士勤的“新思路”给人启迪。高校党政干部中一些有识之士忧虑的是，“换思路”的人还不多，不少人仍被“旧思路”框着，其结果是做大学生思想工作的收效不大，然而他又不反省自己，却反过来一味责怪大学生。
    看来，要改进大学生的思想工作，高校干部一些过时的“思路”确实需要改一改。
