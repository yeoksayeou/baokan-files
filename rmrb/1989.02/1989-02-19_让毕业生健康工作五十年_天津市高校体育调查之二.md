The reporter visited the Tianjin Municipal Education Bureau's Physical Education Office and saw their work plan for 1989. The report stated: The physical condition of college students should be recorded, with annual development plans and clear, specific indicators. We should pay attention to students' physical condition, promote the good, and control the weak. Let Tianjin's college students be "proficient in several sports and capable of several skills," learning lifelong health and fitness training methods. The entire report is full of care. Deputy Director Yu Xiaoya said: "The leadership has new ideas: In the future, we want to ensure that graduates from Tianjin can work healthily for 50 years. The whole concept is refreshing, contrasting sharply with some universities that have distanced themselves from sports, causing it to lose its appeal among students."

The quality of sports is directly proportional to physical strength. Some universities have already suffered the consequences of not promoting sports activities, with some students having poor physical functions, panting after running 50 meters, heart racing after climbing three floors, and a high proportion of nearsightedness, neurasthenia, and stomach problems. They are knowledgeable but frail. Deputy Director Xing Yuansen said: School sports are not good, which is a mistake in education. We have given students knowledge, but we have not given them a good body. Knowledge will be useless in the future. The early deaths of some middle-aged intellectuals, with white-haired people burying black-haired people, are related to the lack of a good physical foundation in universities. Every time I hear of the death of a middle-aged intellectual, my heart aches. The dead have sounded the alarm. Therefore, we are making great efforts to promote sports in various colleges and universities.

The reporter visited Nankai University and Tianjin University and found that it was indeed the case. At that time, it was the end of the semester, and all courses were intense, but the students were still skating and playing ball, very active. On a large, spacious sports field near the river, volleyball, basketball, and soccer were played enthusiastically. Not only that, but the teachers also participated enthusiastically.

Of course, these activities were spontaneous, not purposefully for exercise, but out of interest. Now they want to combine sports with their majors. For example, geology students will engage in more track and field activities, running, jumping, and throwing to train lung capacity and endurance.

It is understood that many students have already learned several methods of physical exercise and have formed the habit of participating in sports. For example, the Business School, everyone knows how to play softball; almost everyone in the Chemical Engineering College knows how to play handball; Nankai University excels in swimming; the Normal College excels in track and field. Graduates from these schools will be able to solve the problem of lifelong exercise in the future and can achieve Marx's hope of cultivating all-around developed individuals. Sports need a certain momentum; relying on closing the school gates to do it will lack vitality. The Municipal Education Bureau decided to hold the Tianjin College Sports Festival this year, lasting for one month, with various competitions in different projects, with students and faculty and staff all participating, everyone included. It's not just for the sake of excitement, but to widely mobilize everyone to participate in sports, which is a manifestation of mass sports. Someone predicts that if Tianjin's college sports system can be sustained year after year, the slogan of "working healthily for fifty years" will become a reality.

### 让毕业生健康工作五十年——天津市高校体育调查之二

　　让毕业生健康工作五十年
    ——天津市高校体育调查之二
    记者来到天津市高教局体卫处，看到他们一份１９８９年工作安排报告。报告是这样写的：大学生体质要有现状记载，要有年度发展计划，指标要明确、具体。关心学生体质，发展优良，控制病弱。让天津的大学生在体育上都“几会几能”，学会终生健体强身的锻炼方法。整个报告充满着爱心。体卫处副处长于小霞说：“局领导还有新的设想：将来要做到从天津毕业的大学生，能健康工作５０年。整个构想，让人耳目一新，这同某些大学疏远体育，使其在学生中失去魅力，形成鲜明的反差。”
    体育的好坏同身体强弱成正比。有的大学已自食不开展体育活动的苦果，有些学生身体机能差，跑５０米就喘，爬３楼心跳，近视眼、神经衰弱、胃病的人比例很高。可谓是满腹经纶，弱不禁风。邢元敏副局长说：学校体育不好，是教育的误区。我们给了学生知识，可是没有给他们一个好身体，有知识将来也白搭。一些中年知识分子早逝，白头发给黑头发送葬，同大学没有打好身体基础是有关系的。每次听到中年知识分子逝世，心里就难过。是死人敲了警钟。所以我们下大力气在各院校开展体育运动。
    记者到南开大学和天津大学采访，果不其然。当时，正是期末考试，各门功课叫劲，可学生们仍在滑冰、打球，十分活跃。在紧靠河边的一大片宽阔的体育场上，排球、篮球、足球打得火热。不仅如此，老师也踊跃参加。
    当然，这些活动都是自发的，不是有目的地去锻炼，而是凭兴趣。现在他们要结合专业开展体育运动。如学地质的，就多开展田径运动，进行跑、跳、投，锻炼肺活量，提高耐力。
    据了解，目前已经有很多学生学会几种锻炼身体的方法，养成了参加运动的习惯，如商学院，大家都懂垒球；化工学院几乎都会打手球；南开大学游泳出色；师范学院田径出众。从这些学校毕业的学生将来大都可解决终生锻炼问题，可望实现马克思所希望的造就全面发展的人。体育运动需要一定声势，靠关起校门搞，就会缺乏生命力。市高教局决定今年举办天津高校体育节，时间为期一个月，开展各个项目比赛，学生和教职员工都参加，人人有份。不是图热闹，而是广泛地发动大家参加体育运动，是全民体育的体现。有人预言天津市这一套大学体育运动系统工程如果能年复一年的坚持下去，“健康工作五十年”的口号，就会变成现实。
