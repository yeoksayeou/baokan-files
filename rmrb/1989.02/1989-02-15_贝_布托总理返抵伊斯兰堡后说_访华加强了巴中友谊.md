Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said after returning to Islamabad from her visit to China that her mission to strengthen traditional Pak-China friendship has been successfully accomplished.

Benazir Bhutto arrived back in Islamabad at 2 a.m. today. She immediately held a press conference in the VIP lounge at Islamabad Airport, where more than a hundred reporters had been waiting for over an hour. In her brief statement, Bhutto said her visit to China was successful. She and the Chinese Premier had held formal talks, during which they discussed international and regional situations, and found "considerable common ground" on these issues. The two premiers also had in-depth discussions on future economic, trade, technological, and tourism cooperation and agreed to set up special agencies to implement these agreements. The two agreements signed will help promote the development of bilateral relations.

Benazir Bhutto also highly praised her meetings with other Chinese leaders, especially with Deng Xiaoping. She described Deng Xiaoping as the "guide and philosopher" of China's reform and opening-up, and a "friend of the Bhutto family." She said Deng's remarks were "warm and profound." She added that during her short visit, all the major Chinese leaders had received her, which showed that Pakistan and China have a "special relationship."

In response to a question from our reporter, Benazir Bhutto said that although her visit to China was short, the gains were substantial. The most significant achievement was the inheritance and development of the traditional friendship established by the previous leaders, and the establishment of a deep understanding between the new generations of leaders of the two countries. These will lay a solid foundation for the continued development of bilateral relations. She also said that compared to her visit to China in 1972, China has undergone tremendous changes.

　　贝·布托总理返抵伊斯兰堡后说    
    访华加强了巴中友谊
    本报伊斯兰堡二月十四日电  记者任毓骏报道：巴基斯坦总理贝·布托结束访华后于今天凌晨二时飞返伊斯兰堡后说：“我的加强巴中传统友谊的使命已圆满完成。”
    贝·布托总理下飞机后当即在伊斯兰堡机场贵宾室举行了记者招待会，百余名记者在那里等待了一个多小时。贝·布托在发表的简短声明中说，她的中国之行获得了成功。她和中国总理举行了正式会谈，双方讨论了国际形势和地区形势，在这些问题上双方都有“相当一致的看法”。两国总理还就今后双方在经济、贸易、科技和旅游等方面的互助合作进行了深入的会谈，并将成立专门机构负责落实。双方签订的两个协议将有助于两国关系的发展。
    贝·布托还高度评价了她和中国其他领导人，特别是同邓小平的会见。她称邓小平是中国改革开放的“指导者和哲学家”、“布托家族的朋友”，邓小平的谈话，“亲切而又深刻”。她说，在她短短的访问期间，所有中国主要领导人都接见了她，这说明巴基斯坦和中国具有“特殊关系”。
    贝·布托总理在回答本报记者提出的问题时说，她这次访华时间短，收获大。最重大的成果是继承和发展了前辈领导人建立的传统友谊，而巴基斯坦和中国的新一代领导人之间又建立了深刻的理解。这些都为继续发展两国关系奠定了基础。她还说，和她一九七二年访华时相比，中国发生了巨大的变化。
