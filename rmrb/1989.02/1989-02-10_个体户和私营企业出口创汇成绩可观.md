Individual households and private enterprises achieve remarkable foreign exchange earnings through exports

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 9 (Reporter Chen Yun) In 1986, Zhu Shujin, an individual household from Kandun Town, Cixi County, Ningbo City, established a pearl craft factory. Her designed dolls and teddy bears were exported through foreign trade departments, earning 10 million yuan in foreign exchange last year.

According to incomplete statistics from the Individual and Private Economy Department of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce on 12 provinces and cities, there are nearly 10,000 individual households and private enterprises like Zhu Shujin that have products for export. Through foreign trade departments or engaging in "three-in-one and one compensation" businesses, they have cumulatively increased the country's foreign exchange income by nearly 1 billion yuan.

These individual households and private enterprises with export products are mainly distributed in coastal open cities, including Guangzhou, Shantou, Foshan, Zhongshan, Dongguan, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Quanzhou, Dalian, Tianjin, Ningbo, Nantong, and Fenghua. Shantou City has 55 private enterprises with export products and 41 private enterprises engaged in "three-in-one and one compensation" businesses, earning 350 million Hong Kong dollars for the country from 1986 to 1988. Nantong City has 124 private enterprises with export products, earning 20 million U.S. dollars in three years. Zhejiang Province has 271 individual households and private enterprises that earned 90 million yuan in foreign exchange in 1987 and 1988.

The head of the Individual and Private Economy Department of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce analyzed that China's individual households and private enterprises are developing an export-oriented economy, showing an upward trend with great potential. Although their product quantities are small, they have a good market abroad. According to a survey, the current problem is that some policies and laws are not suitable for the development of individual and private enterprises in the export-oriented economy, and the export channels are also somewhat blocked.

　　个体户和私营企业出口创汇成绩可观
    新华社北京２月９日电  （记者陈芸）宁波市慈溪县坎墩镇个体户朱淑隽１９８６年办了个珍珠工艺制品厂。她设计的洋娃娃、狗熊，通过外贸部门出口，去年创汇折合人民币１００万元。
    据国家工商行政管理局个体私营经济司对１２个省市的不完全统计，像朱淑隽这样有产品出口的个体户和私营企业已有近万户。他们通过外贸部门出口或从事“三来一补”业务，累计为国家增加的外汇收入折合人民币近１０亿元。
    这些有产品出口的个体户和私营企业大多分布在沿海开放城市，主要有广州、汕头、佛山、中山、东莞、福州、厦门、泉州、大连、天津、宁波、南通、奉化等市。汕头市有产品出口的私营企业５５家，承接“三来一补”的私营企业４１家，１９８６至１９８８年共为国家创汇３．５亿港元；南通市１２４家私营企业有产品出口，三年创汇２０００万美元；浙江省２７１家个体户和私营企业，１９８７、１９８８两年创汇折合人民币９０００万元。
    国家工商局个体私营经济司负责人分析，我国个体户和私营企业发展外向型经济正呈上升趋势，发展潜力很大。尽管他们的产品量小，可在国外很有市场。据调查，目前遇到的问题是，一些政策、法律已不适应个体和私营企业发展外向型经济的需要，出口渠道也有些不畅。
