This year, Shandong Province, a major cotton-producing region in China, plans to reclaim 700,000 mu of wasteland to increase the area of cotton cultivation. This work is currently being implemented across the province.

According to relevant departments in Shandong Province, since 1980, the province's cotton production has ranked first in the country for nine consecutive years. Last year's production accounted for approximately 30% of the national total. The stable development of Shandong's cotton production is closely related to the practice of reclaiming wasteland and expanding cotton cultivation in accordance with local conditions. Over the past nine years, the province has cumulatively reclaimed and planted cotton on 4.67 million mu of land, accounting for about 30% of the total spring cotton planting area last year.

Currently, Shandong Province still has about 5 million mu of wasteland suitable for cotton cultivation, mainly concentrated in the northwestern part of the province. Experts have pointed out that the local population in northwestern Shandong has accumulated rich experience over many years of practice. As long as water and fertilizer conditions are met, the first year of reclamation can yield 50 jin of lint cotton per mu. Officials from relevant provincial departments have stated that Shandong Province is willing to collaborate with textile industry bases in other provinces and cities to jointly develop new cotton production bases.

　　今年拓荒七十万亩  山东扩大种棉面积
    新华社济南２月２２日电  （记者刘德玉）我国棉花主产区山东省今年计划开垦７０万亩荒地，以加大棉花种植面积，目前，这一工作正在全省各地落实。
    据山东省有关部门介绍，从１９８０年以来，这个省棉花产量已连续９年居全国首位，去年的产量约占全国总产量的３０％。而山东棉花生产所以能稳步发展，与因地制宜开垦荒地扩种棉花密切相关。近９年来，全省累计开荒植棉达４６７万多亩，约占去年全省春播棉田面积的３０％。
    目前，山东省尚有适宜开垦植棉的荒地５００万亩左右，主要集中在鲁西北地区。据专家介绍，鲁西北的群众在多年的实践中积累了丰富的经验，只要水、肥等条件跟上，开垦第一年亩产皮棉就可达５０公斤。省有关部门负责人说，山东省愿意与外省市的纺织工业基地携手协作，共同开辟新的棉花生产基地。
