Recently, during a visit to Zhejiang, we heard about an unusual incident involving the competition for "Xi Shi" between Zhujia and Xiaoshan counties.

Xi Shi was a famous beauty from the late Spring and Autumn period in China. Many classic works, including "Mencius," "Xunzi," and "Zhuangzi," mention her. Her fame has been passed down through the generations.

In recent years, Zhujia County and Xiaoshan City have been competing to claim Xi Shi as their own, each asserting that they are her hometown. They have organized discussion forums, press conferences, and developed "Xi Shi's Hometown" tourism routes, as well as restored the "Xi Shi Temple."

As the train slowly pulled into Zhujia Station, a statue of Xi Shi stood on the platform, and a red banner prominently displayed: "Welcome to Xi Shi's Hometown!" It is said that Xiaoshan has an even more impressive move: they petitioned the Ministry of Railways to rename their Linpu Station to "Xi Shi Station." Experts and scholars from various places have been invited to participate in the competition for "Xi Shi." In a periodical of a certain university in Zhejiang, there are 14 articles discussing "Xi Shi's Hometown."

The earliest records of Xi Shi's birthplace are unclear, and later records are contradictory. However, most people believe she was born in Zhujia, by the Pu River, at the foot of Mount Mo Luo. She was active in many areas, leaving behind many relics and legends in Zhujia, Shaoxing, Xiaoshan, Jiaxing, and Suzhou.

In the 1980s, the reform and opening up transformed the Pu River banks, where Xi Shi once washed silk, into a completely different landscape. Xiaoshan City entered the ranks of the top ten county-level "little giants" in the country. The historical agricultural county of Zhujia achieved a total industrial and agricultural output value of 1.8 billion yuan in 1988, with the output value of township enterprises exceeding 1 billion yuan. More than half of the rural labor force has shifted from generations of farming to other industries. The impact of the commodity economy and the updating of farmers' concepts have led them to reevaluate and appreciate the value of Xi Shi's fame with new perspectives. In recent years, "Xi Shi Department Store," "Xi Shi Clothing Store," "Xi Shi Inn," "Xi Shi Market," and other businesses have emerged.

A company in Xiaoshan has developed a tourism route from Hangzhou to Xiaoshan, with 3 out of 6 tourist spots related to Xi Shi's ancient sites, claiming that Xi Shi was born in Xiaoshan because Xiaoshan also has a Mount Mo Luo. The people of Zhujia naturally do not concede.

To this day, the competition for "Xi Shi" seems to be gaining momentum.

Xi Shi, who was once famous for her beauty, has been brought onto the stage of the commodity economy by the people of the 1980s and has received unprecedented attention and promotion. Because she can enhance the local reputation, develop tourism resources, and facilitate the marketing of local products to various places...

Of course, there is also this implication: as the hometown of the beautiful Xi Shi, they feel proud.

### 美人身后多逸事  诸暨萧山抢“西施”

　　美人身后多逸事  诸暨萧山抢“西施”
    新华社记者  朱幼棣  虞云达
    最近在浙江采访，听到了发生在诸暨、萧山两个县市之间抢“西施”的奇事。
    西施是我国春秋末年的著名美人，《孟子》、《荀子》、《庄子》等不少典籍中都有记载。西施的美名，代代流传。
    近几年来，诸暨县和萧山市一直在争抢“西施”，都说是西施的故里。他们或开讨论会，或开新闻发布会，或开辟“西施故里”旅游线路，或重修“西施殿”。
    当列车徐徐开进诸暨站时，便可见西施的塑像站到了月台上，红色的横额赫然映入眼帘：“欢迎您到西施故乡来！”据说，萧山还有更绝的招法：上报铁道部要求把这个市的临浦站改名为“西施站”。各地的专家学者也应邀投入抢“西施”的活动。在浙江某大学的一期学报上，关于“西施故里”的笔谈文章，就有１４篇。
    西施到底出生在哪儿，最早的记载不详，后来的记载也有矛盾，但多数人认为在诸暨浣纱溪畔的苎萝山下。但她活动的地区很多，在诸暨、绍兴、萧山、嘉兴和苏州等地都留下了不少遗迹和传说。
    ８０年代，改革开放使西施当年浣过纱的浦阳江两岸发生了巨变。萧山市进入全国十个县级“小巨人”行列。历史上的农业县诸暨１９８８年工农业总产值达到了１８亿元，其中乡镇企业的产值超过了１０亿元，一半以上的农村劳力从祖祖辈辈耕作的土地上转移出来了。商品经济大潮的冲击，农民观念的更新，使他们开始用新的眼光、新的观点评价和估量“西施”美名的价值了。近年来，“西施百货商店”、“西施服装店”、“西施旅社”、“西施商场”……纷纷在这里出现。
    萧山的一家公司开辟了一条杭州至萧山的旅游线路，６个旅游点中就有３个与西施有关的古迹，并声称西施出生在萧山，因为萧山也有一座苎萝山。诸暨人自然也不相让。
    至今，抢“西施”的活动似乎是方兴未艾。
    曾经以美丽而知名的西施，被８０年代的人们拉上了商品经济的舞台，并且得到了前所未有的重视和宣扬。因为她可以提高本地的知名度，可以开发旅游资源，也有利于当地的产品行销到各地……
    当然，其中也有这样的内涵：作为美人西施的故乡人，他们是感到自豪的。
