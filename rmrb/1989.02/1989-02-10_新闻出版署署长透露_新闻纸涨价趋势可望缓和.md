	The director of the Press and Publication Administration revealed that the trend of rising prices for newsprint, which the news and publishing industry relies on for survival, may ease in the first half of this year, and the supply-demand contradiction may be better resolved. This was stated by Du Daozheng, director of the Press and Publication Administration, in a recent interview with reporters from "China Journalist" magazine.

	Du Daozheng introduced that the price of each ton of newsprint was around 2,000 yuan at the beginning of last year, but it rose to around 3,000 yuan by the beginning of this year. Some newspaper printing points even ran out of paper. The cost of printing one newspaper was not enough to cover the cost of one sheet of paper, forcing periodicals to raise prices significantly. On April 5, 1988, 56 representatives of the Seventh National People's Congress submitted a joint proposal to the State Council requesting measures to address this issue.

	Why did the paper shortage and price increases occur? Du Daozheng believes that the main raw material for producing newsprint is wood. After the state liberalized the price of wood in the south, wood would flow to wherever the price was high, affecting the normal production of paper and paper prices. Additionally, some paper mills were unwilling to sell paper at the planned price; or they would use wood purchased at the planned price to produce higher-priced paper, not producing newsprint according to the plan. Some paper mills would only supply paper to their superiors, refusing to supply to other places.

	Du Daozheng said that last year, China's newsprint production completed about 71% of the original plan. Last year, one out of every five newspapers published was printed on imported paper. Currently, international market paper prices remain high. In 1988, the international market price for newsprint was over $600 per ton, while in 1984 it was over $300, and it has recently started to decline.

	The price problem of paper needs to be reformed and adjusted. Temporary administrative measures have limited effects and are always unstable. Du Daozheng revealed that this year, China's newsprint consumption, if estimated based on the 1988 circulation, is expected to be over 500,000 tons. According to statistics, the total number of periodicals published nationwide in the first quarter of this year compared to the fourth quarter of last year has decreased by 30%. The amount of newsprint used is reduced by about 20% compared to last year. This year, the domestic plan arranges for the production of 300,000 tons of newsprint, and the central and local governments continue to use foreign exchange to import some of it. In addition to the planned production of cultural paper outside the plan, it is expected that the supply-demand contradiction of newsprint this year may be better resolved, and the trend of newsprint price increases may ease.

　  新闻纸涨价趋势可望缓和
    新华社北京２月９日电  （记者许必华、陆小华）新闻出版业赖以生存的纸张，价格上涨趋势今年上半年可望缓和，供需矛盾有可能得到较好的解决。这是新闻出版署署长杜导正最近在接受《中国记者》杂志记者采访时说的。
    杜导正介绍说，每吨新闻纸的价格去年初是２０００元左右，到今年初涨到３０００元左右，有的报纸代印点断纸。一张报纸卖不够一张纸钱，迫使报刊大幅度涨价。１９８８年４月５６位七届全国人大代表曾为此联名提请国务院采取措施解决。
    为何出现纸荒与纸价上涨？杜导正认为，制造新闻纸的主要原料是木材。国家把南方木材价格放开后，哪儿价格一高，木材就向哪里流动，影响了正常的纸张生产与纸价。另外，有的造纸厂不愿按指令性价格卖纸；或者把照指令性价格买来的木材用于生产价格较高的纸，不按指令计划生产新闻纸。也有的纸厂，顶头上司调纸就给，别的地方来调纸就不给。
    杜导正说，去年我国新闻纸生产大概完成了原计划的７１％左右。去年出版的每５份报纸中，就有一份是用进口纸印的。目前，国际市场纸价仍居高不下。１９８８年，国际市场每吨新闻纸要６００多美元，而１９８４年才３００多美元，最近已开始下跌。
    纸张的价格问题要改革、理顺，靠临时的行政措施，作用是有限的，总是动荡不安。杜导正透露说，今年我国新闻用纸量，如按１９８８年发行量估算，估计要用５０多万吨。据统计，今年一季度与去年四季度相比，全国报刊总期发数下降３０％。新闻用纸量较去年减少百分之二十几。今年新闻纸国内计划生产安排了３０万吨，中央和地方继续用外汇进口一部分，加上国内计划外生产安排的文化用纸，预计今年新闻纸的供需矛盾有希望得到较好解决，新闻纸价上涨趋势可缓和。
