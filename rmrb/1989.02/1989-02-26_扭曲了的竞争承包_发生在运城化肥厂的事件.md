Even the best methods, once distorted and spoiled, will yield deformed and bitter fruits! The Yuncheng Fertilizer Plant is a case in point.

Originally, this spring should have been a peak season for fertilizer production and demand. However, the Yuncheng Fertilizer Plant is in a state of chaos: morale is low, management is disorganized, and production has declined. What is the cause? Let's start from the beginning.

On November 28, 1987, the Yuncheng Municipal Economic Commission publicly tendered the Yuncheng Fertilizer Plant for contracting.

The Yuncheng Fertilizer Plant is the first key industrial enterprise in Yuncheng City. Hou Yusheng served as the plant director for 5 years. By the end of 1987, the plant had accumulated debts of over 510 million yuan, with potential losses of over 60 million yuan. None of the targets set by the director's term responsibility system were met.

After the tender mobilization meeting, three bidders emerged: one led by the production department head, one by the engineer Zhang Tianen who had expertise in fertilizers, and one by the plant director Hou Yusheng. Hou Yusheng submitted his contracting plan more than 20 days after the deadline.

Who should be chosen as the contractor?

Before the tendering of the fertilizer plant in October, the deputy mayor of Yuncheng City in charge of industry, Yang Tianzhen, and the director of the Economic Commission, Yang Xingsuo, had conducted investigations into the plant's contracting issues. Yang Tianzhen openly told the crowd at the fertilizer plant: "Hou Yusheng has not improved the fertilizer plant in his 5 years as director and cannot continue as director." Yang Xingsuo also publicly stated: "In recent years, Hou Yusheng has ruined the fertilizer plant and does not accept supervision from the supervising department. If Hou Yusheng continues as director, the Economic Commission will not agree."

However, the attitudes of the leaders suddenly changed. Yang Tianzhen hinted to the tender evaluation team: "Priority should be given to Hou Yusheng contracting the fertilizer plant."

On February 9, Yang Xingsuo notified the leader of the collective bid: "Because you do not have a college degree, your contracting qualifications have been revoked, and you should not participate in the defense meeting." A deputy director of the Economic Commission, Zhao Yongkang, immediately objected: "Hou Yusheng also does not have a college degree, and should be treated equally." Some workers also went to Yang Tianzhen, requesting that the higher authorities seriously study the matter again. Yang Tianzhen said: "Understand the situation, this is a decision that cannot be changed." On February 10, Yang Tianzhen again told some of the evaluators: "If Hou Yusheng does not contract the fertilizer plant, you might as well not come back to see me."

On February 11, during the fertilizer plant's tender contracting defense meeting, workers' representatives asked Hou Yusheng: "Why did the enterprise not improve during your tenure as director?" Yang Xingsuo hurriedly explained: "Do not discuss these matters, they are unrelated to contracting." And temporarily announced: "No one may speak without permission." When workers' representatives requested that the evaluation committee publicly announce the voting results, Yang Tianzhen emphasized: "This is an organizational matter, it has nothing to do with you." Finally, amid the crowd's sighs, without announcing the voting results, it was declared that Hou Yusheng was the contractor for the fertilizer plant.

Why did the leaders' attitudes change so much? Why did the tender contracting go through the motions? It is understood that Hou Yusheng, in order to contract the fertilizer plant, used public funds of over 10,000 yuan in January 1988 to send gifts to Yang Tianzhen, Yang Xingsuo, and some contracting evaluators, dividing them by rank. Just for oranges, he sent 6,940 kilograms, and on one day, he spent over 3,000 yuan on buying famous cigarettes and liquor.

This distorted contracting was not a happy event for Hou Yusheng. The result was command failure, and he had to rely on "strong measures": large-scale dismissals and demotions, with dozens of people being dismissed or demoted in a few months. Hou Yusheng, of course, was also not at ease, so he hired 3 people at a high monthly salary of 620 yuan each as his personal bodyguards.

Production could not be improved, and to cover up the fact that the operating contracting targets were not met, false reports were made. In February and March 1988, Hou Yusheng ordered the statistics personnel to falsely report fertilizer production of 352 tons and falsely report production value of over 52,000 yuan. In July, he falsely reported production of 37 tons, including 14 tons of substandard products passed off as qualified products. This statistician complained during the inspection on August 15: "I know this is against the statistics law, but if I refuse the leader's orders and do not report, I will not be able to stay in the plant." From January to September, Hou Yusheng violated price regulations and sold over 10,000 tons of fertilizer at high prices, and was fined 80,000 yuan by the Price Bureau three times. In the nationwide financial inspection in October, it was found that Hou Yusheng used less cost allocation and falsely reported profits of over 130,000 yuan, and withheld state profits of 31,000 yuan. In November, Hou Yusheng changed tactics and used blank invoices for false sales, falsely reporting profits of over 160,000 yuan.

The plant's chief accountant, Shen Qiuying, disagreed with Hou Yusheng's actions and was demoted and had her salary stopped, and she is still not allowed to work. The financial department head, Li Jing'an, also maintained accounting regulations and was demoted and had his salary stopped.

Last year, the Yuncheng Fertilizer Plant's completed fertilizer production was only 75% of the contracting contract target. According to the contract regulations, the contractor's contract should be terminated, but so far, no measures have been taken. The plant's cadres and workers are discussing: When will the problems of the fertilizer plant be solved?

### 扭曲了的竞争承包——发生在运城化肥厂的事件

　　扭曲了的竞争承包
    ——发生在运城化肥厂的事件
    本报记者  杨文道
    再好的办法，只要一旦扭曲，一旦变味，便会结出畸型的果，苦味的果！运城化肥厂便是一例。
    本来，今年春天，应是化肥生产、需求的旺季，然而，运城化肥厂却处于一种混乱之中：人心乱，管理乱，生产下降。原因在哪里？还得从头说起。
    １９８７年１１月２８日，运城市经委对运城市化肥厂实行公开招标承包。
    运城市化肥厂是运城市工业骨干企业第一家。厂长侯玉生任职５年，到１９８７年底，工厂负债５１０余万元，潜在亏损６０余万元，厂长任期目标责任制的各项指标都没有完成。
    招标动员大会之后，出来了３方投标者：一方是以生产科长牵头的集体投标者，一方是有化肥专业知识的工程师张天恩，一方是厂长侯玉生。侯玉生在超过规定的期限２０多天后，才交出了承包方案。
    到底选谁做承包者？
    在化肥厂实行招标之前的１０月份，运城市主管工业的副市长杨天桢、经委主任杨兴科等就该厂承包问题搞过调查。杨天桢在化肥厂多次向群众公开讲：“侯玉生任厂长的５年，没有把化肥厂搞上去，不能再任厂长了。”杨兴科也公开表示：“几年来，侯玉生把化肥厂搞烂了，而且也不接受主管部门监督，如果侯玉生再任厂长，经委也不能同意。”
    然而，领导者们的态度后来却突然变了。杨天桢暗示招标考评组：“要优先考虑侯玉生承包化肥厂。”
    去年２月９日，杨兴科通知集体投标一方的牵头人：“因为你没有大专文凭，被取消承包资格，不要参加答辩会了。”经委一位副主任赵永康当场提出异议：“侯玉生也没有大专文凭，应该一视同仁。”一些职工也找到杨天桢，要求上级领导再认真地研究一下。杨天桢说：“要认清形势，这是决定的，不能改变。”２月１０日，杨天桢又对部分评委说：“如果侯玉生承包不上化肥厂，你们就别回来见我。”
    ２月１１日，化肥厂招标承包答辩大会上，职工代表向侯玉生提问：“这几年你任厂长期间，企业为什么搞不上去？”杨兴科忙着解释说：“不谈这些事，这与承包无关。”并临时宣布：“未经许可不准发言。”当职工代表提请评委会应该当众公布投票结果时，杨天桢强调：“这是组织上的事情，与你们无关。”最后，在群众一片唉叹声中，未公布选票结果，就宣布侯玉生为化肥厂承包人。
    领导们的态度为什么变化这么大？为什么招标承包走了形式？据了解，侯玉生为了能够承包化肥厂，于１９８８年元月，动用公款一万多元，给杨天桢、杨兴科和部分承包评委等单位分别按等级送了礼，仅桔子就送了６９４０公斤，有一天买名烟名酒就花掉了３０００多元。
    这种扭曲的承包，对侯玉生来说，也不是什么喜事，结果是指挥失灵，只得靠“强硬措施”：大撤大换，有的被解雇，有的被撤职，几个月里被撤换的达几十人次。侯玉生当然也不得安宁，于是以每月６２０元的高薪雇用３人作为厂长的私人保镖。
    生产搞不上去，为了掩盖完不成经营承包指标的事实，弄虚作假。１９８８年２至３月间，侯玉生责令统计人员虚报化肥产量３５２吨，虚报产值５．２万多元。７月份再次虚报产量３７吨，其中有１４吨次品冒充合格品。这个统计员在８月１５日的检查中抱怨：“我知道这是违反统计法的，如果顶着领导不报，怕在厂里不好呆。”１至９月份，侯玉生违反物价法规，高价销售化肥一万多吨，三次被物价局罚款８万元。在１０月份全国财务大检查中，查出侯玉生利用少摊成本、虚报利润１３万余元，截留国家利润３．１万元。１１月份，侯玉生变换手法，采用开空票假销售，虚报利润１６万余元。
    该厂主管会计申秋玲不同意侯玉生的作法，被撤职并停发工资，至今不让上班。财务科长李景安也为维护会计法规，被撤职、停发工资。
    去年，运城化肥厂完成的化肥产量只占承包合同指标的７５％，按合同规定，应终止承包者的合同，但至今未见有什么措施。化肥厂干部工人议论纷纷：化肥厂的问题何时才能解决？
