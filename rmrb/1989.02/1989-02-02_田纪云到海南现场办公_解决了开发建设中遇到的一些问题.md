Tian Jiyun Visits Hainan for On-Site Office Work

Resolves Some Issues Encountered in Development and Construction

According to Xinhua News Agency, Haikou, February 1: Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council Tian Jiyun recently pointed out during his on-site office work in Hainan that we must resolutely rectify the economic environment, rectify the economic order, and deepen comprehensive reforms. At the same time, we must resolutely implement the strategy of developing the coastal economy. This is the wish and demand of the whole Party and the people of the whole country. Whether in the short term or in the long-term economic development and construction, we must resolutely adhere to the general policy of reform and opening up, not just in words, but in actions to organize and implement it.

During his on-site office work in Hainan Province, Tian Jiyun led officials from the State Council's Special Economic Zones Office, the State Planning Commission, the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade, the People's Bank of China, and the General Administration of Customs. He listened to the work reports from the leaders of the Hainan Provincial Party Committee and the provincial government, and inspected several factories in Haikou, the Yangpu Economic Development Zone, the Haikou Thermal Power Plant, and the Qinglan Port.

Tian Jiyun pointed out that Hainan Province must seriously implement the policy of rectifying the economic environment, rectifying the economic order, and deepening comprehensive reforms. Rectification and rectification work are necessary not only for the inland areas but also for the economic special zones. Doing so will create a more favorable economic and social environment for opening up and reform, which is beneficial for accelerating the construction of the economic special zones.

Tian Jiyun said that the development and construction of Hainan must pay attention to the development of agriculture. There are two constraints to consider in the development and construction of Hainan: one is water, and the other is agriculture, mainly the grain problem. Agricultural development investments should be raised through multiple channels, and some foreign capital can be appropriately utilized.

Tian Jiyun and his entourage conducted an on-site inspection of the Yangpu Port area and listened to a special report. He expressed support for the idea of introducing foreign capital to develop the Yangpu Port area in a comprehensive manner and proposed that the management of the Yangpu Port area, once developed, should be carefully studied.

During the on-site office work, Hainan Province reported to Vice Premier Tian Jiyun and the relevant officials from the State Council departments who were working together that the special zone encountered some problems in development and construction. Most of these problems were resolved on the spot.

　　田纪云到海南现场办公
    解决了开发建设中遇到的一些问题
    据新华社海口２月１日电  中共中央政治局委员、国务院副总理田纪云最近在海南现场办公时指出，我们要坚定不移地治理经济环境，整顿经济秩序，全面深化改革；同时，要坚定不移地实施沿海地区经济发展战略。这是全党和全国人民的心愿和要求。无论是近期还是长远的经济开发建设，都要坚定不移地坚持改革开放的总方针、总政策，不是口头上，而是在行动上坚定不移地组织实施。
    田纪云在率领国务院特区办、国家计委、经贸部、中国人民银行、海关总署的负责同志到海南省现场办公期间，听取了中共海南省委、省政府领导同志的工作汇报，并先后考察了海口的一些工厂、洋浦经济开发区、海口火电厂和清澜港。
    田纪云指出，海南省要认真贯彻治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序和全面深化改革的方针。治理、整顿工作，不仅对内地是必要的，对经济特区也是必要的。这样做，会为开放、改革创造更为有利的经济和社会环境，有利于加快经济特区的建设。
    田纪云说，海南开发建设，必须重视发展农业。海南开发建设，有两个制约因素要考虑，一个是水，一个是农业，农业主要是粮食问题。农业开发的投资，要多渠道筹集，也可适当利用一部分外资。
    田纪云同志一行到洋浦港区进行了实地考察，听取了有关的专题汇报。他表示支持引进外资对洋浦港区搞成片开发的设想，并提出洋浦港区一旦开发，如何管理，要认真进行研究。
    在现场办公过程中，海南省向田纪云副总理及随同一起办公的国务院有关部门的负责同志，反映了海南特区在开发建设中遇到的一些问题，其中绝大部分问题都当场得到了解决。
