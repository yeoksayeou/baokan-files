The 23rd Institute of the Ministry of Machinery and Electronics has recently completed two cable technology achievements, indicating that China has reached the advanced world level in the transmission of aerospace remote sensing images and high-power color television images. These achievements were recently approved by experts.

The radiation-resistant, low-loss special coaxial cable system is a high-difficulty feed component used in aerospace remote sensing to transmit target image information. When connected between the satellite transmitter and the satellite antenna, it can quickly transmit high-resolution target information detected by remote sensing to the ground, converting it into clear, distinct remote sensing images. Its performance indicators have reached and surpassed the advanced level of similar foreign products in the 1980s.

As a cable and connector for decimeter wave (13 channels and above) color television transmission systems, this is another new achievement that the institute's technical personnel have overcome in two years. It is understood that this cable assembly made of high-precision copper tape and high-density polyethylene material has the characteristics of high power, low loss, and low standing wave. In a 50-square-kilometer broadcast area, the transmitted image is clear and lifelike, with stable and reliable performance, and excellent viewing effect. Chengdu has adopted this new technology for more than a year, and the general public is very satisfied.

　　机电部二十三所获两项电缆技术新成果   
    传输航天遥感和大功率彩电图像清晰
    本报讯  机械电子工业部第２３所新近完成的两项电缆技术成果表明，我国在传输航天遥感图像及大功率彩色电视图像方面，已跃上世界先进水平台阶。上述成果不久前通过专家鉴定。
    耐辐射、低损耗特殊同轴电缆系统，是航天遥感中用于传输目标图像信息的一种高难度主馈部件。把它联接于遥感卫星发射机与卫星天线之间，即可将遥感探测到的甚高分辨率目标信息迅捷传输到地面，转换成图质清晰、层次分明的遥感图片。它的性能指标已达到并超过国外８０年代同类产品先进水平。
    作为分米波（１３频道以上）彩色电视发射系统用的电缆及连接器，是该所科技人员用２年时间攻克的又一新成果。据了解，这种用高精度铜带和高密度聚乙烯材料做成的电缆组合件，具有大功率、低损耗、低驻波特点。在５０平方公里转播区内，传输图像清晰逼真，性能稳定可靠，收视效果上佳。成都采用此项新技术一年多，广大观众颇为满意。
