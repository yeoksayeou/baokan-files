The Three Outer Space Treaties

Q: The Fourth Session of the Standing Committee of the Seventh National People's Congress approved China's accession to the three treaties on the rescue of astronauts, liability, and registration. Could you please explain the main contents and significance of these three treaties? What is the importance of China's accession to these treaties?

A: The full names of these three treaties are: "Agreement on the Rescue of Astronauts, the Return of Astronauts and the Return of Objects Launched into Outer Space," "Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects," and "Convention on Registration of Objects Launched into Outer Space."

Since humans entered the space age, the development of space law has been rapid. In 1967, under the auspices of the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, the "Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies," known as the "Outer Space Charter," was concluded. Subsequently, under the auspices of the United Nations, the above three treaties were adopted. They are essentially extensions and specific implementations of the three main principles of the "Outer Space Treaty," and their main contents are conducive to the development of human activities for the peaceful use of outer space.

The Rescue Agreement, adopted in 1968, stipulates that in the event of an astronaut landing due to an accident, the country where the astronaut lands should immediately take all necessary measures to rescue them. If the astronaut lands in international waters, assistance should be provided for search and rescue, and the astronaut should be immediately returned to the launching authority. If a space object or its components are found to have landed on the ground, the launching authority and the United Nations Secretary-General should be notified, and upon the request of the launching authority, the object should be returned. The costs are to be borne by the launching authority.

The Liability Convention, concluded in 1972, stipulates that the launching state is absolutely liable for damages caused by space objects it launches to the surface of the Earth or to aircraft in flight; and is liable for damages caused in places other than the surface of the Earth on the basis of fault. The affected state should make compensation claims to the launching state through diplomatic channels; the launching state should pay compensation in accordance with international law and the principles of equity and reasonableness to ensure that the damage is restored to its original state before the incident occurred.

The Registration Convention, concluded in 1975, stipulates that the launching state should register the objects it launches in its own registry and provide relevant information to the United Nations, including the date and place of launch, basic orbital parameters, and the general functions of the launched space objects.

Since China successfully launched its first artificial satellite in 1970, it has made significant achievements in the aerospace industry, attracting worldwide attention. China has already joined the "Outer Space Treaty" in 1983. Officially joining the above three treaties will further subject China to the relevant specific regulations. This will be conducive to promoting China's international cooperation in the aerospace field.

　　外空三条约
    问：七届人大常委会四次会议通过我国加入外空援救、责任和登记３个条约，请问这３个条约的主要内容和作用何在？我国加入有何重要意义？
    答：这３个条约的全名分别是：《关于援救航天员、送回航天员及送回外空物体之协定》、《外空物体所造成损失之国际责任公约》和《关于登记射入外层空间物体的公约》。
    自从人类进入空间时代以来，外空法发展迅速。１９６７年，在联合国外空委员会主持下缔结了《外空条约》，即《关于各国探测及使用外层空间包括月球与其他天体之活动应遵守原则之条约》，被称为“外空宪章”。以后在联合国主持下又相继通过了上述３个条约，它们实际上是《外空条约》中３项主要原则的扩展和具体化，其主要内容有利于人类和平利用外空的活动的发展。
    １９６８年通过的援救协定规定，对因意外事故降落的航天员，降落地国应立即采取一切措施进行营救；如降落在公海，则应协助搜寻和援救，并立即送还发射当局；如发现外空物体或其组成部分降落地面时，应通知发射当局和联合国秘书长，在发射当局要求下予以归还。费用由发射当局支付。
    １９７２年缔结的责任公约则规定，发射国对所发射的外空物体在地球表面或飞行中的飞机造成的损害负有赔偿的绝对责任；对在地球表面以外的地方造成的损害负有过失责任。受害国应通过外交途径向发射国提出赔偿要求；发射国依国际法和公正合理原则支付赔偿，以保证把损害恢复到未发生前的原有状态。
    １９７５年缔结的登记公约规定发射国应将所发射物体登入其所保持的登记册，并向联合国提供有关情报，包括发射日期和地点、基本轨道参数和所发射外空物体的一般功能。
    我国自１９７０年成功地发射第一颗人造卫星以来，在航天事业上取得重大成就，引起世界的注目。我国已于１９８３年加入《外空条约》，正式加入上述３条约将进一步受有关具体规定的约束。这将有利于促进我国在航天领域的国际合作。
