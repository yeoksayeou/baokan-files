Beijing International Trade Fair Opens with a Single Sentence

    A report from our Beijing correspondent, Zhao Xinglin, and Xinhua News Agency correspondent, Li Yanfei: “The Beijing International Trade Fair now opens.” At 9 AM today, Zhang Ming, Director of the Beijing Municipal Commission of Economy and Trade, spoke these words, and over 1,000 domestic and foreign businesspeople immediately entered the Beijing Exhibition Hall to discuss business.

    This trade fair's opening ceremony was different from previous ones. There was no ribbon-cutting, no fireworks, and no customary banquets or gifts. Additionally, the number of on-site staff was reduced by 30%, and one-third fewer office spaces were rented. These reforms saved the entire event over 300,000 yuan in expenses.

　　北京外贸洽谈会  开幕只说一句话
    本报北京２月２１日讯  本报记者赵兴林、新华社记者李亚非报道：“北京市对外经济贸易洽谈会现在开幕。”今天上午９点，北京市经贸委主任张明的话音刚落，１０００多名中外客商随即进入北京展览馆大厅洽谈生意。
    这届洽谈会的开幕式与以往不同，不剪彩，不放鞭炮，也取消了惯例酒会和礼品，同时精简驻会人员３０％，少租办公用房１／３。这样一改革，整个会议节约费用３０多万元。
