“We’re too tired, we need a breather, we want to read some extracurricular books.” This voice, filled with fatigue and almost pleading, comes from a group of middle school students.

As the winter vacation approaches, they saw their school preparing for make-up classes, so they wrote a letter to the mayor of Shenyang seeking help.

The children are indeed very tired. Every parent of a primary and middle school student knows that from the first day of school, their children start a grueling journey like marathon runners. There are endless math problems, countless English vocabulary words to memorize, and countless homework assignments from various subjects that keep their young hearts tightly bound. How many semesters have they endured like this? Every time they get a break, they can only rest for a few days symbolically. A middle school student said helplessly, "Vacations should belong to us, but in recent years, schools have taken away our vacations, leaving us exhausted. Who can stand this? Another student revealed in a letter to the mayor the truth about make-up classes: some schools set up make-up classes outside the school to avoid inspections by higher authorities. The content of make-up classes is not a review of old lessons but the teaching of new lessons. Some schools even charge tens of yuan for make-up classes.

After receiving these letters, Ai Tingjun, the deputy mayor of Shenyang in charge of education, felt that this long-standing problem had become increasingly serious. At his suggestion, the Shenyang Municipal Education Commission recently issued an "Emergency Notice on Prohibiting Make-Up Classes During the Winter Vacation," which was welcomed by most parents, students, and teachers.

　　“我们太累了，我们要喘口气”
　　沈阳中学生投书市长要假期
    据新华社沈阳２月４日电  （记者刘欣欣、通讯员梁昕秋）“我们太累了，我们要喘口气，看点课外书”。这充满疲倦、近乎哀求的声音，出自一群中学生之口。
    寒假到来之际，他们看到学校又在做补课的准备，于是写信给沈阳市市长求助。
    孩子们确实太累了。每一位中小学生的家长都十分清楚，从开学第一天起，孩子们就像马拉松运动员一样，开始了艰辛的旅程。做不完的数学题，背不完的外语单词，写不完的各科作业，把他们那颗童心紧紧地拴住了。多少个学期，他们都是这样度过的。每到放假，只能象征性地休息三五天。一位中学生无可奈何地说，假期本应属于我们，可这几年，学校夺走了我们的假期，弄得我们疲惫不堪，总这样，谁受得了呢！另一位中学生在给市长的信中则揭露了补课的内情：一些学校把补课地点设在校外，防备上级来检查，补课的内容不是复习旧课，而是讲授新课，一些学校还要收十几元的补课费。
    沈阳市主管教育的副市长艾廷隽接到这些来信后，感到这个多年未解决的问题越来越严重。在他的建议下，最近沈阳市教委发出了《寒假期间禁止补课的紧急通知》，得到了多数家长、学生和教师的欢迎。
