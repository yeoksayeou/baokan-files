A rare giant fungus has been discovered in Changchun. The fungus measures 36.5 centimeters in length and weighs 10.5 kilograms. It was unearthed from a layer of yellow soil during construction work two years ago. The construction workers, out of curiosity, ate half of the fungus and experienced no signs of poisoning. The remaining half of the fungus has been kept indoors for two years and shows no signs of decay. Experts have analyzed the fungus and believe it to have been growing for over a thousand years. Understanding its composition and the reason for its lack of decay could provide new scientific insights into geriatric medicine, the development of anti-aging drugs, and the climate changes in the Changchun region.

　　长春发现特大真菌
    国内罕见的特大真菌在长春发现。真菌长36.5厘米，重10.5公斤，它是在两年前施工中从黄土层中挖出。施工工人好奇地将真菌吃掉一半，无中毒现象。现真菌放置在室内两年之久仍保持原样不腐烂。据有关专家分析，这一真菌已生长了一千年以上。搞清它的成分和不腐烂原因，将会对老年医学研究、抗衰老药的研制、对长春地区的气候变迁提供新的科学依据。这是长春中医学院的科研人员郭晓芹（右一）、陈哲实（中）、何玉贤在观察真菌的外部形态和内部结构变化。
