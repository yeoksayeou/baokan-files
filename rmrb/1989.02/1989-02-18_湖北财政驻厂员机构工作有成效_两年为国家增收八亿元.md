The financial supervision teams stationed in Hubei by the Ministry of Finance have achieved significant results in their work. Over the past two years, more than 120 financial supervisors have, through their financial supervision and management of central enterprises within their jurisdiction, investigated and rectified various violations, contributing 8 billion yuan to the state, with an average of nearly 700 million yuan per person.

Focusing on the position and characteristics of central enterprises, the financial supervision teams have placed their work emphasis on preventing "leakage, waste, and loss" and ensuring that central financial revenues are timely and fully remitted to the treasury. They have mainly focused on the following areas:

1. Assisting enterprises in improving their management, deeply promoting the "double increase, double savings" activities, and enhancing enterprise economic benefits. Last year, they worked with the Hubei Provincial Insurance Company to research and formulate five indicators: insurance premium income, claim rate, expense rate, profit, and per capita insurance premium income. They implemented a management method linking these indicators with staff bonuses, quickly turning the company around from a loss to a profit. Insurance premium income increased by 40% compared to the previous year, the claim rate decreased by 17.02%, and a profit of 100 million yuan was realized. They also helped summarize the financial management experiences of 15 central enterprises, including the Second Automobile Works, and achieved good results after promoting them throughout the province.

2. Auditing enterprise financial revenues and expenditures to plug "leakage, waste, and loss" of funds. Over the past two years, the financial supervision teams have audited the financial statements of more than 200 central enterprises, identifying a total adjustment amount of 116.96 million yuan, thereby increasing financial revenue by 50 million yuan.

3. Exercising supervision functions and focusing on "rectification and reorganization." During the 1987 and 1988 tax, financial, and price inspections, the financial supervision teams, at the request of the State Council's "Inspection Office" and the Ministry of Finance, focused on inspecting 142 central enterprises, recovering a large amount of lost funds for the state.

　　湖北财政驻厂员机构工作有成效    
    两年为国家增收八亿元
    本报讯  财政部驻湖北中央企业财政驻厂员机构是１９８７年元月组建的。两年来，１２０多名驻厂员，通过对辖区内中央企业行使财政监督管理职能，查处、整治各种违纪行为，为国家增收８亿元，人均近７００万元。
    针对中央企业所处的地位及其特点，财政驻厂员机构把工作重点放在防止“跑、冒、滴、漏”，上确保中央财政收入及时足额入库。他们主要抓了以下几项工作。
    一、帮助企业改善经营管理，深入开展“双增双节”活动，提高企业经济效益。去年他们与湖北省保险公司一起研究制定保费收入、赔付率、费用率、利润、人均保费收入５项指标，并实行同职工奖金挂钩的管理办法，使公司的经营很快扭亏增盈，保费收入比上年增长４０％，赔付率下降１７．０２％，实现利润１０００万元；他们还帮助总结了二汽等１５家中央企业财务管理经验，在全省推广后收到较好效果。
    二、审查企业财务收支，堵塞资金“跑、冒、滴、漏”。两年来，财政驻厂员机构共审查了２００多个中央企业的会计决算，查出应调整决算的总金额为１１６９６万元，相应增加财政收入５０００万元。
    三、行使监督职能、抓好“治理、整顿”。在１９８７年度和１９８８年度税收财务物价大检查中，财政驻厂员机构受国务院“大检查”办公室及财政部的委托，重点检查了１４２个中央企业，为国家追回了大笔流失资金。
