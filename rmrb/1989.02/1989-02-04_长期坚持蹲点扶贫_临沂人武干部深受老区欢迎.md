Long-Term Persistence in Poverty Alleviation: Local Military Officers in Linyi Gain Popularity in Old Revolutionary Bases

According to Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, February 2nd. Recently, various counties in Linyi region of Shandong Province conducted democratic evaluations of cadres. The results showed that military officers and some county and township cadres who persistently worked in poverty-stricken villages received the most votes. The people of Duozhuang Township under Menglianggu said, "We welcome these cadres who work for the people's welfare!"

Located in the Yimeng Mountain area, Linyi region is one of the key poverty-stricken areas designated by the State Council. To help the people of the old revolutionary bases shake off poverty as soon as possible, the Linyi Military Sub-region and the military departments of its 13 counties and cities have, in recent years, dispatched over 440 cadres to 400 of the poorest villages, where they persistently work on poverty alleviation. They have organized nearly 2,000 training sessions on planting, breeding, mechanical repair, and other subjects for the counties and townships, helped the masses establish 255 economic entities, and organized the militia to complete 1,560 major tasks such as digging wells, building roads, and excavating canals. So far, 364 villages under the jurisdiction of various levels of military departments in the Yimeng Mountain area have shaken off poverty. More than half of these villages have electricity and road access, solved the problem of drinking water for humans and livestock, and all schools in the poverty alleviation points have completed the renovation of school buildings. The State Council, the General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army, and the Jinan Military Region have repeatedly circulated their experiences.

During the poverty alleviation work, cadres at various levels of military departments have carried forward the fine tradition of sharing weal and woe with the masses, living, eating, and working in the villages, and wholeheartedly working for the people of the old revolutionary bases to shake off poverty and become prosperous. When they go to the villages, they usually bring their own food, cook their own meals, and when busy, often eat dry pancakes with plain water. When the masses invite them to eat or send them meat, vegetables, and eggs, they always politely decline. They say, "Poverty alleviation is our duty, and eating from the poor is a great shame!"

In the depths of the Yimeng Mountain area, Longquan Village lacks water for eight months a year. The cadres from the Yinan County Military Department, who are stationed there, organized the militia to work hard for a winter and spring, digging three deep wells to solve the problem of drinking water for humans and livestock, and also diverted water from a neighboring county to solve the problem of irrigation. Now, the village's agricultural and sideline productions are thriving, with an average annual income of over 1,000 yuan per person.

　　长期坚持蹲点扶贫
　  临沂人武干部深受老区欢迎
    据新华社济南２月２日电  （记者王志耘、通讯员苏亚）山东省临沂地区各县最近开展民主测评干部。测评结果表明，长期坚持在贫困乡村蹲点扶贫的人武干部和一些县乡干部得票最多。孟良崮下的垛庄乡群众对记者说，俺们就是欢迎这些一心为老百姓谋福利的干部！
    地处沂蒙山区的临沂地区是国务院确定的重点扶持贫困地区。为了使老区人民尽快摆脱贫困，临沂军分区和所属１３个县市武装部最近几年先后抽调４４０多名干部，进驻４００多个最贫困的乡村，长期坚持蹲点扶贫。他们为各县乡举办种植、养殖、机械修理等各种培训班近２０００期，帮助群众兴办各种经济实体２５５个，组织民兵完成打井、筑路、开渠等艰巨任务１５６０多项。到目前为止，沂蒙山区各级人武部门承包的扶贫点，已有３６４个村脱了贫。其中一半以上村庄通了电、通了车、解决了人畜饮水难的问题，所有扶贫点上的学校都完成了校舍改造工作。国务院、解放军总政治部和济南军区多次转发了他们的经验。
    在蹲点扶贫中，各级人武干部发扬当年老区干部与群众同甘共苦的好传统，住在点上、吃在点上、干在点上，全心全意为老区人民脱贫致富出力。他们下乡蹲点，一般都自带粮食，自己升火做饭，忙起来常常是白开水加干煎饼。群众请他们吃饭，或给他们送来肉、菜、蛋，他们总是婉言谢绝。他们说：“扶贫是我们的义务，吃贫是莫大耻辱！”
    沂蒙山区腹地的龙泉村，一年中有８个月缺水。在这里蹲点的沂南县武装部干部组织民兵苦战一冬春，打了３口深井，解决人畜饮水问题，又从邻县引来河水，解决了浇地用水。现在，这个村农副业生产齐头并进，人均年收入１０００多元。
