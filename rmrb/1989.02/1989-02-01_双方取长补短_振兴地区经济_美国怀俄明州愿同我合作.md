To revitalize the regional economy, the state of Wyoming in the USA is preparing to strengthen economic cooperation with China.

Governor Mike Sullivan of Wyoming recently said in New York to a reporter from this news agency that Wyoming is "very interested" in doing business with China and the prospects are bright.

According to him, the state has begun cooperation with China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in livestock and wool production. He said that Wyoming can provide China with specialized knowledge in livestock breeding and grain cultivation. In the future, the state can cooperate with China in mining, environmental protection, tourism management, and other areas, providing modern technology and specialized knowledge.

Among the 50 states in the USA, Wyoming ranks ninth in area but has the smallest population, with only about 500,000 people. Rich in natural resources, it is the largest producer of bentonite and soda ash in the USA, the second-largest producer of uranium and coal, and an important agricultural area. The state's tourism resources are also rich, with the world-famous Yellowstone National Park within its borders.
