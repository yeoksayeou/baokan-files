French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas concluded his two-day visit to Iran on February 6. This visit marks the first time in nearly a decade that a French foreign minister has traveled to Tehran since the two countries resumed diplomatic relations last June.

One concrete outcome of this ministerial meeting is the decision to establish a working group to study and ultimately resolve financial disputes between the two countries.

Currently, the most important issue in Franco-Iranian relations is the development of economic cooperation. Accompanying Minister Dumas to Tehran were representatives from ten major French companies in the fields of petroleum, electricity, agriculture, food, and pharmaceuticals. They met with government officials and business leaders.

Minister Dumas' visit also laid the groundwork for political exchanges between the two countries' leaders. Iranian ministers of foreign affairs, telecommunications, and industry will visit Paris in succession. French Speaker of the National Assembly Laurent Fabius and Iranian Speaker of the Parliament Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani will also engage in reciprocal visits. Paris commentators are optimistic about the future of Franco-Iranian relations.

　　法国外长结束访伊　两国决定捐弃前嫌
    本报巴黎2月7日电　记者张启华报道：2月6日，法国外交国务部长罗朗·迪马结束了对伊朗为期两天的访问，这是两国在去年6月复交后，也是近十年来法国外长头一次出访德黑兰。
    这次外长会晤的一个具体成果是，双方决定成立一个工作班子，具体研究并最终解决两国之间的财务纠纷问题。
    目前，法伊关系中最重要的是开展经济合作问题。随同迪马外长到德黑兰的有法国石油、电力、农业食品、制药等十个大企业的代表，他们分别会见了政府和企业人士。
    迪马外长的访问，也为两国领导人的政治接触打下了基础。伊朗外交、电信、工业部长将相继访问巴黎。法比尤斯议长和拉夫桑贾尼议长也将进行互访。巴黎时事评论人士对法伊关系持乐观态度。
