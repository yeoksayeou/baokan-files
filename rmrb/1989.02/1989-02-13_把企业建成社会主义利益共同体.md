In what direction should enterprise reform deepen? This is a major question that must be answered. I would like to share some thoughts on establishing enterprise property rights and building the enterprise into a community of common interests.

Recently, Comrade Zhao Ziyang pointed out: "Our enterprises are socialist enterprises. The Party's policies and the state's legal system, the overall interests of the state and the specific interests of the enterprise, the interests of managers and workers, and immediate and long-term interests, should all be reasonably reflected and unified within the enterprise. The entire enterprise is a community of common interests." This is a summary and explanation of the concept of building the enterprise into a community of common interests in the new situation of deepening reform.

As a community of common interests, the enterprise means the coordination and unification of the interests of various aspects of society within the enterprise. This was impossible to achieve before the reform. Under the old economic system—product economy, planned economy, and a single public ownership economy—although it was repeatedly emphasized that the interests of the state, collective, and individual should be balanced, and that the interests of various aspects of socialism should be unified, this was merely an empty slogan that could not be realized. Instead, under the guidance of the idea of "big and public," there was often a contradiction and opposition between the three interests. The state could disregard the interests of the enterprise, and the enterprise could disregard the interests of the workers. Therefore, today's proposal to build a "socialist community of common interests" is completely in the sense of negating the old system and establishing a new system. It is proposed in the new situation, new policies, new environment, and new path of reform.

To build a true community of common interests, we must adapt to the needs of the development of socialist commodity economy, deepen the reform of the enterprise labor system and distribution system, and reform the ownership structure and property rights system. In the previous stage of reform, the contract responsibility system has been widely applied, greatly releasing the vitality of the enterprise; although the shareholding system is still in the pilot stage, it is generally considered to have deep significance for property rights reform. Building a community of common interests is not something independent of the contract responsibility system and the shareholding system. They are not isolated from each other, nor are they opposed to each other. Implementing the contract responsibility system and the shareholding system is the process of building a community of common interests, that is, it is included in the process of building a community of common interests; while building a community of common interests is the fundamental goal of deepening enterprise reform with the contract responsibility system and the shareholding system as the main content. As a manager of a large enterprise group, based on the experience of reform and development of Wuhan Steam Turbine Generator Factory and China Yangtze Power Company over the past few years, I believe that establishing enterprise property rights is of key significance to the construction of a community of common interests.

The form of ownership is an important characteristic that distinguishes socialism from capitalism. However, the structure of socialist ownership cannot be considered to be merely the nationalization of assets in the form of full public ownership. Ten years of reform have already enabled us to explore the scientific structure of socialist ownership from both practical and theoretical perspectives.

Establishing enterprise property rights that complement full public ownership is an important component of the socialist ownership structure with Chinese characteristics. Although there is still debate about the rationality of the existence of enterprise property rights, it has already been manifested in China's economic life (for example, enterprise mergers are usually based on the establishment of enterprise property rights), and with the formation, development, and growth of the enterprise as a "community of common interests," it will become a universal reality.

The enterprise property rights I propose here refer to the part of the enterprise's retained profits that is not personal income. It exists in the form of enterprise collective ownership, neither should it be classified as state-owned nor can it be quantified to individuals.

Why should this part of the enterprise property rights not be classified as state-owned? Because its source is not the state's reinvestment, but the accumulation and increase of the enterprise's operating and production results after reflecting the state's interests. Although it is formed with the help of the state's original investment, the size or existence of the operating results is not completely the same in each enterprise. Some enterprises, due to good management, rapid production development, and high economic benefits, will have increasingly larger enterprise property rights formed by their own funds for expanding reproduction and welfare facilities; while enterprises with poor management may be the opposite, not only failing to form enterprise property rights, but some may even "eat up" the state's investment.

Will the establishment of enterprise property rights harm the state's interests? No. Why? First, in addition to paying taxes according to law, the enterprise also gives the state a "dividend" in the form of a base growth contract for the state's original investment. With the expansion of enterprise property rights, under the condition of implementing the shareholding system, the proportion of state shares and enterprise shares may change, but even if the state shares do not increase, they will not decrease like the past with the depreciation of fixed assets; second, the expansion of enterprise property rights signifies the enhancement of management capabilities and the improvement of productivity levels, which is more conducive to the state's macro-control. The state's position as an investment subject is not only not weakened but also improved; third, this wealth hidden in the enterprise, in the form of "enterprise collective ownership," and through effective management and increase, will make the enterprise a carrier of multi-party (state, enterprise, managers, workers, etc.) interests. Therefore, the establishment of enterprise property rights will make various enterprises exist and develop as communities of common interests, and their prosperity and development are closely related to the personal interests of every worker. Expanding operations and developing production will become the common interest goal of the workers.

Is the establishment of enterprise property rights a "retrograde step" of turning "big public into small public"? No. The only standard to measure progress or retrogression is whether it can promote the development of productive forces. Marxist principles tell us: production relations that deviate from productive forces are obstacles to the development of productive forces. In the process of forming and developing the enterprise "community of common interests," some measures taken to develop production and revitalize the economy may have been implemented by capitalism, but this does not mean retrogression. Because in both social systems, what is being carried out today is socialized mass production. As a result of human civilization progress adapted to this type of production, it cannot be said that only capitalist enterprises can use it, while socialist enterprises cannot.

The establishment of enterprise property rights will lay the ownership foundation for the formation and development of the enterprise as a "community of common interests," and the growth and strengthening of the "community of common interests" will be the driving force for the development of social productive forces. Once productive forces develop rapidly, the superiority of socialism can be fully demonstrated. Therefore, I believe that the deepening of enterprise reform should be carried out around the major issue of turning the enterprise into a "community of common interests."

　　把企业建成社会主义利益共同体
    于志安
    企业改革应朝什么方向深化？这是必须回答的重大课题。我想讲一点建立企业产权，把企业建成利益共同体的想法。
    最近，紫阳同志指出：“我们的企业是社会主义社会的企业，党的方针政策和国家的法律制度，国家的总体利益和企业的具体利益，经营者的利益和职工的利益，当前利益和长远利益，都应在企业中得到合理的体现和统一，整个企业是一个利益共同体”。这是在深化改革的新形势下，对把企业建成利益共同体的内涵所做的概括和解释。
    企业作为利益共同体，意味着社会各方面的利益在企业内的协调和统一。这在改革之前是不可能实现的。在旧的经济体制——产品经济、计划经济、单一的国有经济的体制下，虽然也一再强调兼顾国家、集体、个人三者利益，社会主义各方面利益的统一，但它不过是一句不可能实现的空洞口号，更谈不上使企业成为利益共同体。相反，在“一大二公”思想指导下，往往形成了三者利益的矛盾对立，国家可以不顾企业的利益，企业也可以不顾企业劳动者的利益。因此，今天提出“社会主义利益共同体”的构想，完全是在否定旧体制、建立新体制这个意义上，是在改革的新形势、新政策、新环境、新道路上提出的。
    要把企业建成真正的利益共同体，就要适应社会主义商品经济发展的需要，深化改革企业劳动制度、分配制度，改革所有制结构和产权制度。在前一段的改革中，承包制已被广泛运用，极大地释放了企业的活力；股份制虽然还处在试点阶段，但被普遍认为具有产权改革的深层意义。建设利益共同体不是独立于承包制和股份制之外的东西，它们之间不是绝缘的，更不是对立的。施行承包制、股份制是建设利益共同体的运动过程，即包含在建设利益共同体的过程之中；而建设利益共同体则是以承包制、股份制为主要内容深化企业改革的基本目标。作为一个大型企业集团的经营者，结合武汉汽轮发电机厂、中国长江动力公司几年改革与发展的经验，我认为建立企业产权，对建设利益共同体的建设具有关键意义。
    所有制形式是区分社会主义和资本主义的重要特征。但是，社会主义所有制的结构，却不能认为仅仅是资产国有化的全民所有制。十年的改革，已经可以使我们从实践中和理论上来探索社会主义所有制的科学结构了。
    建立与全民所有的国有产权相辅相成的企业产权，是中国特色的社会主义所有制结构的重要组成部分。尽管对企业产权存在的合理与否还在争论，但它在我国经济生活中已经有了体现（如企业兼并通常就是以企业产权的确立为基础的），而且随着企业这种“利益共同体”的形成、发展、壮大，它将成为一种普遍现实。
    我在这里所提出的企业产权，是指企业经营所得的留利中非个人所得的部分。它以企业共有的形式而存在，既不应划归国有，也不能量化到个人。
    这部分企业产权为什么不应划归国有呢？因为它的来源不是国家的重新投资，而是企业经营和生产成果在体现了国家利益之后的积累和增殖，尽管它是借助国家原来投资而形成的，但是，经营成果的大小或有无，在各个企业是不完全相同的。有的企业由于经营好，生产发展快，经济效益高，企业用自有资金扩大再生产和福利设施的产权会越来越大；而经营不好的企业可能恰恰相反，不仅未能形成企业产权，有的甚至还会把国家的投资“吃”光。
    企业产权的建立会不会损害国家的利益呢？不会。理由何在？第一，企业除依法纳税外，还对国家原来投资的那一份，以基数增长承包的形式给国家以“红利”。随着企业产权的扩大，在实行股份制的情况下，国家股与企业股的比例可能会发生变化，但国家股即使不再增加，也不会像以往那样，随固定资产的折旧而逐渐减少；第二，企业产权的扩大标志着经营能力的增强和生产力水平的提高，更有利于国家的宏观调控，国家作为投资主体的地位不仅没有削弱，而且得到了改善；第三，这种藏富于企业的产权，以“企业共有”的形式存在，并通过有效的经营而增殖，将使企业成为多方（国家、企业、经营者、职工……）利益的载体。因此，企业产权的确立将使各类企业作为利益共同体而存在和发展，其兴旺发达与每个职工的切身利益血肉相关，开拓经营、发展生产，将成为职工的共同利益目标。
    建立企业产权是不是“化大公为小公走倒退的路”呢？不是。衡量前进还是倒退的标准只有一个，那就是看能否促进生产力的发展。马克思主义的原理告诉我们：背离生产力的生产关系是生产力发展的障碍。在形成和发展企业“利益共同体”的过程中，为发展生产、振兴经济所要采取的措施，有些可能是资本主义已经实施过的，但这也绝不意味着是倒退。因为在两种社会制度下，当今所进行的都是社会化大生产，作为与这种生产类型相适应的人类文明进步的成果，不能说只有资本主义企业能用，而社会主义企业就不能用。
    企业产权的确立，将为企业这个“利益共同体”的形成和发展确立所有制基础，而“利益共同体”的成长和壮大，又是社会生产力发展的推动力。生产力迅速发展起来了，社会主义优越性才能充分显示出来。所以，我认为，企业改革的深化，应该围绕把企业办成“利益共同体”这个重大课题来进行。
