The completion ceremony and award presentation for the newly built Zaxi Nangjie Lingka Pagoda Hall for the tombs of the 5th to 9th Panchen Lamas was held today at Tashilhunpo Monastery. Over 350 engineering and technical personnel who participated in the construction of the Pagoda Hall were commended and rewarded.

The Zaxi Nangjie Lingka Pagoda Hall for the tombs of the 5th to 9th Panchen Lamas was rebuilt under the care of the Party Central Committee and the Tibet Autonomous Region, with the support of Tashilhunpo Monastery. The Panchen Lama originally planned to personally award and commend the Han and Tibetan engineers and technicians who contributed to this project. Unfortunately, he passed away due to illness and was unable to fulfill this wish. Today, the leading group of the Zaxi Nangjie Lingka Pagoda Hall for the tombs of the 5th to 9th Panchen Lamas and the Democratic Management Committee of Tashilhunpo Monastery held this award presentation and ceremony to complete the arrangements made by the Panchen Lama before his passing. It was conveyed that the Panchen Lama had previously stated that the rebuilding and consecration of the Zaxi Nangjie Lingka Pagoda Hall for the tombs of the 5th to 9th Panchen Lamas was a result of the care and support from the Party and various levels of government. In the future, efforts should continue to explore and develop Tibetan national architectural art, strengthen the training of the next generation, and ensure that this unique national architectural art shines brightly.

　　修建五至九世班禅合葬灵塔殿有功人员受表彰
    据新华社日喀则２月３日电  （新华社记者、中央人民广播电台记者）新建五世至九世班禅东陵扎西南捷灵塔殿竣工表彰大会，今天在扎什伦布寺举行。参加修建班禅东陵扎西南捷灵塔殿的３５０多名工程技术人员受到表彰和奖励。
    五世至九世班禅东陵扎西南捷灵塔殿是在党中央和西藏自治区的关怀和扎什伦布寺的支持下重新修建的。班禅大师原计划亲自发奖表彰兴建这一工程的藏汉族有功工程技术人员，但他不幸因病圆寂，未能如愿。今天，五世至九世班禅东陵扎西南捷灵塔殿领导小组和扎什伦布寺民主管理委员会为完成大师生前的安排，特意举行这次表彰和发奖大会。据传达，班禅大师生前说，五世至九世班禅东陵扎西南捷灵塔殿的重建、开光是党和各级政府的关怀，今后要继续挖掘、发展藏民族建筑艺术，加强培养下一代，使这一富有民族特色建筑艺术发出灿烂的光彩。
