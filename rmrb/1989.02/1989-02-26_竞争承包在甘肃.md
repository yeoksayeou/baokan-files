		Competition Contracting in Gansu
		Zhang Shusheng Bai Wenqing
		In 1988, Gansu wrote a history characterized by competition contracting.

		This year, competition contracting was fully implemented in five sectors: industry, commerce, construction, transportation, and science, education, and health. Taking industrial enterprises as an example, by the end of last year, 86.63% of all state-owned industrial enterprises in the province had contracted out; 91.3% of provincial-level large and medium-sized industrial enterprises had contracted out. The coverage of competition contracting reached 65%. According to a survey of budgetary enterprises in the province, 80% of the contracted enterprises completed or exceeded the various indicators and showed significant changes in their operating conditions; about 10% did not complete some indicators, but their economic benefits increased compared to before contracting, and the appearance of the enterprises changed. The survey shows that the success rate of contracting has reached 90%.

		Gansu's competition contracting has three distinct features:

		— Carefully selecting the best contractor. In promoting competition contracting, some places and units were found and corrected in time for their tendency to publicly announce tenders but actually have leaders secretly decide or go through the motions. The focus was on openness, implementing public bidding, public tendering, public defense, and public determination of the contractor; not engaging in internal favoritism that only talks about priority without conditions, but insisting on equality, selecting the best from the best, and appointing the best; paying attention to the examination of the qualifications of bidders, embodying seriousness; and also paying attention to the intellectual structure of the bidders.

		— Carefully selecting the best operating plan. Emphasis was placed on three aspects: first, scientificity, whether the plan reflects the laws of commodity economy, whether there are competitive operating measures, and whether it is suitable for the actual situation of the enterprise; second, advancement, emphasizing the overcoming of the two tendencies of higher indicators being more advanced and lowering indicators, and timely promoting the experience of Gan County, Gansu, in "four accounts" (calculating both fixed and variable accounts; both small and large accounts; both the actual completion average of the past three years and the incremental account of the contracting period; both the account of internal potential and the account of external development), "two connections" (connecting various contracting indicators with the "Seventh Five-Year Plan" and term target responsibility system), aiming at promoting the development of productive forces; third, rationality, reasonably determining the distribution ratio between the state and the enterprise, the incremental rate of remittance to the state's finances, generally not lower than before contracting. Last year, the contracted enterprises in the province's budgetary industrial enterprises realized a profit of 5.9321 billion yuan, an increase of 12.55% over 1987, accounting for 96.32% of the total profit realized by budgetary enterprises.

		— Opening up new horizons for the formation of an entrepreneurial team. Statistics from 35 contracted enterprises in the province show that nearly 400 former obscure "small figures" showcased their talents in competition contracting, taking up leadership positions in workshops, offices, and factory departments, and performing a series of powerful management and supporting reform dramas; a group of factory directors and managers who could only organize production according to mandatory plans in the past are now more mature and experienced, increasingly showing their entrepreneurial talents; more impressively, more than 100 party and government officials and researchers stepped out of their deep courtyards, competing to contract and create great achievements. Last year, the contracted enterprises in the province's budgetary industrial enterprises completed a production value of 92.9%, an increase of 14.64% over 1987.

		Some people say that Gansu's contracting year achieved a strategic breakthrough, which can be summarized in three sentences in a certain sense: good at learning, daring to practice, and sticking to one goal. Whether the statement is accurate remains to be verified. But Gansu's sincere learning from the advanced experiences of brother provinces and cities, and its determination to practice in combination with its own actual situation, is a fact. In August 1987, Comrade Zhao Ziyang visited Gansu and pointed out: "If the contracting system is not combined with the competitive mechanism, the contracting system may not necessarily succeed in the end." He suggested that the comrades in Gansu go to Handan to broaden their horizons. The Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government, in accordance with the spirit of Comrade Zhao Ziyang's speech, organized a thousand cadres from the province to go to the countryside and factories to help enterprises with competition contracting. In December of the same year, a vice governor led a team to Handan to learn from the experience of competition contracting. On January 9, 1988, Governor Jia Zhijie, on behalf of the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government, raised the flag to the people of the province: to make 1988 the year of contracting throughout the province, with reform as the overall situation. The breakthrough in reform lies in contracting, and the key to contracting is to introduce the competitive mechanism. The Provincial Economic System Reform Commission organized cadres to go to hundreds of industrial and commercial enterprises in 14 prefectures and cities to provide specific guidance and promote contracting; one-third of the leaders and cadres from various provincial-level departments and bureaus were assigned to handle line-by-line and system-wide competition contracting. The main leaders at all levels, like the implementation of the rural household contract responsibility system, rushed towards one goal, household by household, and grasped it to the end. As the overall commander, the Provincial Government held a provincial-level meeting every quarter to analyze and study, inspect and summarize, and determine the breakthrough points. The framework that large and medium-sized enterprises with good economic benefits cannot engage in competition contracting was broken. Many enterprises, internally contracted to the bottom, horizontally contracted to the edge, formed a contracting network that promotes each other from top to bottom and left to right, and created a lively and upward situation.

　　竞争承包在甘肃
    张述圣　白文清
    １９８８年，甘肃书写了以竞争承包为特色的历史。
    这一年，竞争承包在工业、商业、建筑业、交通运输业和科教文卫５个层次上全面推开。以工业企业为例，到去年底，全省全民所有制工业企业中，承包的占８６．６３％；省属大中型工业企业，９１．３％的已经承包。竞争承包面达到６５％。据对全省预算内企业的调查，承包企业完成和超额完成各项指标、经营状况发生显著变化的占８０％；个别指标虽未完成，但比承包前经济效益有增长、企业面貌有变化的占１０％左右。调查表明，承包的成功率已达到９０％。
    甘肃的竞争承包有３个明显特点：
    ——精心选择最佳承包者。在推行竞争承包中，及时发现并纠正一些地方、一些单位名为公开招标、实为领导暗中内定或者走过场的偏向，突出公开性，实行公开招标、公开投标、公开答辩、公开确定承包人；不搞不讲条件、只讲优先的内部照顾，坚持平等性，优中选优，择优选聘；重视对投标者素质的考察，体现严肃性；还注意了投标者的智力群体结构。
    ——精心选择最佳经营方案。注重了３个方面：一是科学性，看方案是否反映了商品经济规律，是否有竞争经营措施和符合本企业实际；二是先进性，重视克服指标越高越先进和压低指标两种倾向，适时推广了甘肃礼县“四算帐”（既算死帐，又算活帐；既算小帐，又算大帐；既算前３年实际完成平均帐，又算承包期递增帐；既算内涵挖潜帐，又算外延发展帐）、“两衔接”（各项承包指标与“七五”计划、任期目标责任制衔接）的经验，着眼于促进生产力发展；三是合理性，合理确定国家和企业的分配比例，上缴国家财政的递增幅度，一般不低于承包前。去年，全省预算内工业企业中，承包企业实现利润５．９３２１亿元，比１９８７年增长１２．５５％，占预算内企业实现利润总数的９６．３２％。
    ——为企业家队伍的形成开辟了新天地。全省３５家承包企业的统计显示，近４００名昔日默默无闻的“小人物”，在竞争承包中一展风采，登上车间、科室、厂部领导岗位，演出了一幕幕强化管理和配套改革的雄壮话剧；一批过去只能按指令性计划组织生产的厂长、经理，如今更加成熟老练，日益显露出企业家的经营才干；更令人赞赏的是，１００多名党政机关干部和科研人员走出深宅大院，竞争承包创大业。去年预算内工业企业中，承包企业完成的产值，占到９２．９％，比１９８７年增长１４．６４％。
    有人说，甘肃承包年取得战略突破，在某种意义上可以概括为三句话：善于学习，勇于实践，一个目标走下去。说法是否准确，当然有待论证。但甘肃诚心学习兄弟省市先进经验，结合自己的实际下决心实践，确是事实。１９８７年８月，赵紫阳同志来甘肃视察时指出：“承包制如果不同竞争机制结合，承包制也不一定能最后成功。”他建议甘肃的同志去邯郸看看，开阔眼界。省委、省政府根据赵紫阳讲话精神，组织全省千名干部下乡进厂，帮助企业搞竞争承包。同年１２月，由一名副省长带队，去邯郸学习竞争承包经验。１９８８年元月９日，省长贾志杰代表省委、省政府，向全省人民亮了旗：要把１９８８年作为全省承包年，以改革总揽全局。改革的突破口在承包，承包的关键是引入竞争机制。省经济体改委组织干部到１４个地州市的数百个工商企业，具体指导，推动承包；省级各专业厅局抽出１／３的领导和干部，抓条条、系统的竞争承包。各级主要领导像当年抓农村联产承包责任制那样，奔着一个目标干，一户一户抓，一抓到底。作为总指挥的省政府，每季召开一次全省性会议，分析研究，检查总结，确定突破重点。打破了经济效益好的大中型企业不能搞竞争承包的框框。不少企业，内部纵包到底，横包到边，形成上下左右互相促进的承包网络，出现了奋发向上的生动局面。
