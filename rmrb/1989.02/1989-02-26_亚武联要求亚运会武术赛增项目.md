The Asian Wushu Federation recently sent a letter to the organizing committee of the 11th Asian Games, requesting that the number of wushu competition events be increased from the originally planned 6 to 10. This decision was made during the executive committee meeting of the Asian Wushu Federation held in Shenzhen, China, at the end of January.

Executive committee members from China, Japan, Singapore, and Hong Kong, among others, attended the meeting. They believed that the inclusion of wushu as an official competition event in the Asian Games by the Asian Olympic Council is a great encouragement to the Asian wushu community, demonstrating the vitality of wushu in promoting the health and friendship of people from various countries. The executive committee of the Asian Wushu Federation decided to actively organize member associations to prepare technically and organizationally for the 11th Asian Games. Simultaneously, they will organize the second Asian Wushu Championships to be held in Hong Kong in December this year as a rehearsal for the wushu competition at the Asian Games.

The executive committee of the Asian Wushu Federation reviewed the situations of several international wushu competitions held in recent years. They believed that the originally planned 6 events for the 11th Asian Games—men's and women's all-around, Taiji Quan, and Nanquan—would present certain difficulties and inconveniences in terms of competition organization and judging. Therefore, they suggested that the organizing committee of the 11th Asian Games increase the number of events to 10, with men's and women's Changquan, Taiji Quan, Nanquan, long weapons (spear and staff), and short weapons (saber and sword), to boost the enthusiasm of wushu athletes from various countries to participate in the competition.

　　亚武联要求亚运会武术赛增项目
    本报讯日前，亚洲武术联合会致函第１１届亚运会组委会，要求将武术比赛项目由原定６项改为１０项进行。这是亚武联执委会１月底在中国深圳举行会议时决定的。
    参加会议的中国、日本、新加坡、香港等５名执委认为，武术被亚奥理事会通过作为亚运会正式比赛项目，是对亚洲武术界的鼓舞，标志着武术对增进各国人民健康和友谊是富有生命力的。亚武联执委会决定积极组织各会员团体从技术和组织上做好参加第１１届亚运会的准备，同时，组织好今年１２月在香港举行的第二届亚洲武术锦标赛，作为亚运会武术比赛的演练。
    亚武联执委会研究了近年多次国际武术比赛的情况，认为第１１届亚运会原拟设的男女３项全能、太极拳和南拳共６个项目，在比赛的组织和裁判工作上都有一定困难和不便。为此，建议第１１届亚运会组委会增加为１０个项目，即男女各设长拳、太极拳、南拳、长器械（枪和棍）、短器械（刀和剑），以调动各国武术运动员参赛的积极性。
