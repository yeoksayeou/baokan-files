The reporter met with several factory managers and directors in Shijiazhuang. Despite their confusion and worries, they displayed a strong sense of mission and responsibility. In summary, they believe that in the process of rectifying the economic environment and order, enterprises must play a proactive role.

Focusing on Self-Digestion Capabilities

The wave of rising raw material prices has hit the Changzheng Rubber Shoe Factory in Shijiazhuang. At the beginning of last year, it was predicted that the cost of raw materials such as rubber, cloth, chemical auxiliaries, and packaging materials would increase by over 10 million yuan compared to the previous year. Faced with this situation, some suggested raising prices to offset the increased costs. However, factory director Zhao Canghu believed that passing the burden of rising raw material prices to consumers was not a good strategy. Instead, he thought it was better to focus on enhancing self-digestion capabilities. After repeated discussions and explorations, they formulated the "internal commodity-based full-employee management method" as a countermeasure. This method turned all labor and materials within the factory into priced commodities. Through the factory's internal bank issuing priced vouchers, the relationships between various departments (workshops), offices, and teams changed from supply and receipt to monetary exchange. Each production link became both a buyer of the previous process and a seller to the next, linking production and management benefits with each individual's income.

This strategy proved effective! Thousands of employees became conscious commodity producers and managers, paying attention to consumption, quality, cost, output, and management profits and losses, thereby enhancing their self-digestion and bearing capabilities. From April last year when the commodity-based full-employee management method was implemented to the end of the year, the factory digested 500 million yuan in price increases, accounting for 60% of the price increase for raw materials and auxiliaries used in production during the same period. In the first half of the year, their profits and taxes ranked first in the nation among similar industries.

Zhang Xingran, the director of Shijiazhuang First Plastic Factory, is known for his "trick" of improving efficiency and increasing remuneration. This involves increasing efficiency and benefits as the basis for increasing employees' remuneration, with the unit product value remuneration decreasing by 5% each year. For example, in 1987, completing 10,000 yuan in product value resulted in a remuneration content of 317 yuan, which decreased to 304 yuan in 1988. Workers had to work at full capacity, finding every possible way to improve product quantity and quality, reduce consumption, and maintain or exceed the previous year's income. By the end of last year, the factory's per capita product value efficiency increased by about 20%, digesting 400 million yuan in raw material price increases, accounting for more than one-third of the total price increase. When discussing this issue, Zhang Xingran said: Improving efficiency and increasing remuneration, from the perspective of a single enterprise, can enhance internal digestion capabilities and curb product price increases; from a macro perspective, it can stimulate the enthusiasm of laborers, create more material wealth, increase effective supply, and help fundamentally alleviate the contradiction between social total supply and total demand.

There is a peculiar phenomenon: many enterprises complain about others raising prices, but they are also raising prices. If every enterprise can restrain itself and focus on self-digestion, this "wild horse" of price increases can be tamed.

Building a "Magpie Bridge" for Supply and Demand

The disorder in the circulation sector and the numerous links are important reasons for the "snowballing" price increases. To address this issue, the Shijiazhuang Regional Materials Bureau has been working hard to build a "magpie bridge" for supply and demand. They have established 131 specialized companies and over 400 supply points in 13 counties and cities across the region, directly selling upstream production materials to users in a tiered manner and striving to achieve direct linkage between production, supply, and sales. The Machinery and Electrical Equipment Company under the bureau, in collaboration with 13 renowned manufacturers nationwide, established a diesel generator set exhibition and service center, forming a one-stop production, supply, and sales operation group. Last year, over 90% of the diesel generators sold were directly procured from manufacturers; the contract prices for sales at the beginning of this year were also lower than market prices.

The large price increase in color televisions is a headache! At the request of the municipal government, Shijiazhuang No. 1 Commercial Bureau worked with the Shijiazhuang Television Factory to implement a solution: distributing 17,000 television vouchers to various units in three batches for the capital's residents to purchase with vouchers. At the sales site, a newlywed couple, while adjusting the image, told the reporter: This method is good. Otherwise, "official speculators" and "private speculators" would flip it a few times, costing an extra thousand yuan.

Regarding this, Shijiazhuang Regional Materials Bureau Director Jiao Guowu has a different perspective: Reducing circulation links not only helps in rectifying circulation order, curbing "official speculators" and "private speculators," and stabilizing prices but also frees up excessive manpower, materials, and financial resources that have blindly entered the circulation sector, redirecting them towards developing productive activities. This is also a key point in addressing price increases.

Political and Ideological Work is a Hard Task

At Shijiazhuang Wireless Electronics Factory No. 1, there are many novel practices: no one fights over dormitory assignments; no one compares bonuses. Even the once-a-year 3% wage increase does not cause any commotion.

Factory director Peng Zhanjue shared his "secret"—implementing the secretary's work target responsibility system to create a new situation in political and ideological work. All levels of party secretaries in the factory have signed responsibility contracts to both manage employees' ideological work and improve enterprise production, with specific indicators broken down and assigned to branch committee members, party small group leaders, and party members, forming a network of upper and lower-level responsibilities. Over 70 middle-level cadres and 280 party members in the factory, according to their divisions, mobilize over 1,300 workers; cadres and party members are also supervised by the workers.

In this "one-acre, three-division land," there is harmony between leaders and employees, and workers are enthusiastic and productive, with production thriving.

　　发挥企业的能动作用
    ——石家庄企业采访随记
    本报记者　陈国琦
    记者在石家庄接触到一些企业的厂长经理，他们虽有困惑和苦恼，但更多的还是强烈的使命感和责任感，概括到一点就是：在治理经济环境，整顿经济秩序中，一定要发挥企业的能动作用。
    　　　　目光盯在自我消化能力上
    原材料涨价的浪潮，冲击着石家庄市长征胶鞋厂。去年初预测，全年计划生产所需生胶、面布、化工辅料及包装材料涨价，将使产品成本比上年上升１０００多万元。面对这种情况，有人主张高进高出，来个胶鞋大涨价。厂长赵藏虎却认为：把原材料涨价负担转嫁给消费者不是良策，还是应把目光盯在增强自我消化能力上。经过反复论证、探索，他们制定了“内部商品化全员经营法”这一应变对策，把厂内一切劳务和实物全部化为有价商品；通过厂内银行发行的有价证券，使各分厂（车间）、科室、班组之间，由过去的供给、领取关系，变成货币交换关系，每个生产环节既是上道工序的买方，又是下道工序的卖方，并把生产经营效益与每个人的收入挂起钩来。
    这一招果然见效！数千名职工成了自觉的商品生产者和经营者，大家都注意生产中的消耗高低、质量优劣、成本升降、产量多少以及经营盈亏，增强了自我消化和承受能力。从去年４月份实行商品化全员经营法到年底，这个厂共消化涨价金额５００多万元，占同时期生产所用原材辅料涨价数额的６０％；上半年利润和税金名列全国同行业榜首。
    石家庄市第一塑料厂厂长张兴让的“拿手戏”是提效增酬。即在提高效率和效益的基础上，增加职工的报酬，规定单位产值报酬每年递减５％，比如１９８７年完成１万元产值，报酬含量是３１７元，１９８８年下降为３０４元。工人只有满负荷地工作，千方百计提高产品数量和质量品级，减少消耗，才能保持并高于前一年的收入。到去年底，全厂人均产值效率提高２０％左右。消化原材料涨价金额４００多万元，占全部涨价数额的１／３以上。谈到这个问题时，张兴让说：提效增酬，从一个企业看，可增强内部消化能力，抑制产品涨价；从宏观上讲，能激发劳动者积极性，创造更多的物质财富，增加有效供给，有利于从根本上缓解社会总供给和总需求的矛盾。
    有一种怪现象：不少企业埋怨别人涨价，可自己也在涨价。作为社会的细胞，如果每家企业都约束自身，着力于自我消化，涨价这匹野马是有可能被制服的。
    　　　　为产需双方架“鹊桥”
    流通领域秩序乱、环节多，是导致“滚雪球”涨价的重要原因。为除此痼疾，石家庄地区物资局想方设法为产需双方架设“鹊桥”。他们在全区１３个县市建起了１３１个专业性公司、４００多个供应网点，把上游生产资料分层次地直接销售给用户，并尽量实现产、供、销直接挂钩。该局下属机电公司联合全国１３个名优厂家，成立柴油发电机组展销服务中心，形成产供销一条龙经营集团。去年销售的柴油发电机９０％以上是从厂家直接进货的；今年初的销售合同价格也均低于市场价。
    彩电涨价幅度大，令人头疼！石家庄一商局受市政府委托，和石家庄电视机厂走了这样一着棋：把１．７万张电视机票通过各单位分３次发给省会各界群众，凭票购买。在销售现场，一对新婚夫妻一边调试着图像，一边对记者说：这办法不错。要不，“官倒”、“私倒”倒腾几个过儿，就得多花千把元。
    对此，石家庄地区物资局长焦国武另有一番见地：减少流通环节，不仅有利于整顿流通秩序，戒绝“官倒”、“私倒”，稳定物价，而且可以把盲目涌入流通领域的过多人力、物力和财力解脱出来，用于发展开发性生产。这也是解决涨价的一个着眼点。
    　　　　思想政治工作是硬任务
    在石家庄市无线电一厂，有不少新鲜事：分宿舍，没人争要；发奖金，没人攀比。就连一年仅有的一次３％长工资，也无人吵闹。
    厂长彭战果亮出了他的“诀窍”——实行书记工作目标责任制，开创政治思想工作新局面。全厂各级党的书记都签订了既抓好职工思想工作，又搞好企业生产的责任制，并把指标具体分解落实到支委、党小组长和党员头上，形成上下承包的网络。全厂７０多名中层干部、２８０多名党员，按分工把１３００多名工人分别带动起来；干部和党员也受到了职工监督。
    在这“一亩三分地”里，干群之间、职工之间思想融洽，奋发工作，生产蒸蒸日上。
