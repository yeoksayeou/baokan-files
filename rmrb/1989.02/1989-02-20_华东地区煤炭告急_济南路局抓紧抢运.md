To alleviate the coal shortage in East China, the Jinan Railway Bureau has taken active measures to rush the transportation of coal, supporting the economic development of East China. From February 5th to 17th, coal was transported for 13 consecutive days, totaling 1,377,700 tons, with an average daily excess of 5,976 tons over the plan.

Since the beginning of this year, due to the increased number of passenger trains during the Spring Festival and the shortage of coal resources, coal transportation has faced significant challenges. The coal supply for power generation in the East China power grid and for residential use has frequently been in crisis, greatly affecting industrial and agricultural production and residential life. To ensure coal supply in East China and prioritize the needs for power generation, the Jinan Railway Bureau seized the opportunity during the Spring Festival when some passenger trains were suspended and railway transportation was temporarily eased to expedite the transportation of coal from Shanxi.

　　华东地区煤炭告急    济南路局抓紧抢运
    本报济南２月１９日电  为缓和华东地区煤炭紧张的矛盾，济南铁路局积极采取措施抢运煤炭，支援华东经济建设。从２月５日至１７日，连续１３天运煤１３７７７００吨，日均超计划运煤５９７６吨。
    今年以来，由于春运增开旅客列车较多，煤源紧缺等原因，给煤炭运输带来很大困难，华东电网发电用煤、居民生活用煤频频告急，使工农业生产和居民生活受到很大影响。为保证华东用煤，重点满足发电用煤需要，济南铁路局抓住春节前后停开部分旅客列车，铁路运输暂趋缓和的时机，抓紧接运晋煤。
