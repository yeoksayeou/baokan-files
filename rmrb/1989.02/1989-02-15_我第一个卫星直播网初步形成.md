China's first satellite broadcast network, designed to serve county and city-level newspapers and radio stations, has now connected 19 satellite receiving stations, with another 28 stations under construction and expected to be operational by the end of this year.

This satellite broadcast network is a small satellite data receiving system established by Xinhua News Agency for newspapers and radio stations at the county and city levels nationwide. It uses the fifth satellite of the International Satellite Organization, positioned over the Indian Ocean, to provide news to county and city-level newspapers and radio stations.
