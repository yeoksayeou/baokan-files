According to the Office of the Leading Group for Economic Development in Poor Regions under the State Council, following the poor regions of southern and northeastern Fujian, Jiangxi's Jinggangshan region has become the second large area among the 18 contiguous poor regions nationwide to solve the problem of basic subsistence. By the end of 1988, 90% of the poor households in this region had their basic subsistence needs met, thus basically achieving the strategic goal of solving the basic subsistence problem for the majority of the population in poor regions during the "Seventh Five-Year Plan" period, two years ahead of schedule.

According to a report from Jiangxi's Jian Region: In recent years, the Jinggangshan region has explored a new path of "development, enterprise, labor transfer, and seeking benefits" in its poverty alleviation and development work. So far, the entire region has established 296 economic entities with the mission of poverty alleviation, arranging employment for 10,229 poor household laborers, and driving 8,116 poor households to develop commodity production. Based on the strategic concept of "leaning on Jiangsu and Zhejiang, facing Fujian and Guangdong," this famous old revolutionary base has continuously expanded its cooperation with developed regions, large and medium-sized cities, industrial and mining enterprises, colleges and universities, and research institutions in various forms. At present, it has established cooperative relationships with 32 cities and counties and has started construction on several large-scale joint development projects in cooperation with Shanghai Carpet Factory and China Nonferrous Metals Import and Export Corporation. At the same time, farmer technical training and infrastructure construction are being continuously strengthened. In 1988, the entire region held 996 training classes, training a total of 121,545 people, with more than 60% of the poor households mastering one or two practical skills for getting rich.

Last year, Jiangxi's Jinggangshan region had already solved the basic subsistence problem for 38,656 poor households and 205,345 poor people, with 30% of the poor households having a per capita income of over 300 yuan. Currently, the poverty alleviation work in the Jinggangshan region is transitioning from solving the basic subsistence problem to a new stage of economic development focused on developing the regional economy.

　　提前两年实现国务院提出的贫困地区“七五”发展目标
    井冈山地区多数贫困户解决温饱
    本报讯  据国务院贫困地区经济开发领导小组办公室介绍：继福建闽西南、闽东北贫困地区之后，江西井冈山地区已成为全国１８个集中连片贫困地区中第二个解决温饱问题的大片，１９８８年底这里解决了９０％贫困户的温饱问题，提前两年基本上实现了国务院提出的“七五”期间解决贫困地区大多数群众温饱问题的战略目标。
    据江西省吉安地区报告：近几年，井冈山地区扶贫开发工作探索出了一条“搞开发、办企业、转劳力、求效益”的新路子。到目前为止，全区共兴办各类以扶贫为使命的经济实体２９６个，安排贫困户劳力１０２２９人就业，带动了８１１６个贫困户发展商品生产。根据“依托江、浙，面向闽粤”的战略构想，这个著名老革命根据地与发达地区、大中城市、工矿企业、大专院校、科研单位等多种形式的联合不断扩大。目前已和３２个地、市、县结成协作关系，与上海地毯厂、中国矿产进出口公司联合的几个大跨度联合开发项目已陆续开工建设。同时，农民技术培训和基础设施建设也在不断加强。１９８８年，全区共举办各类培训班９９６期，累计培训１２１５４５人次，６０％以上的贫困户掌握了一至两门致富实用技术。
    去年江西井冈山地区已经解决了３８６５６个贫困户、２０５３４５贫困人口的温饱问题，其中３０％的贫困户人均收入超过３００元。目前，井冈山地区的扶贫工作正在从解决温饱问题转向以发展区域经济为主的经济开发新阶段。
