Zhangjiakou region implements fertilizer freight subsidy

	The Zhangjiakou Regional People's Government recently held a meeting on the procurement of locally produced fertilizers, reiterating that 8 million yuan will be allocated from the regional budget to continue providing freight subsidies for fertilizers supplied to remote mountainous areas in the region.

	The 12 counties in Zhangjiakou region are spread over an area of 34,000 square kilometers. Transporting fertilizers from the regional fertilizer plants to these remote rural areas costs over 60 yuan per ton in freight alone. Many of these remote mountainous areas have not yet solved their basic food and clothing needs, and their production investment capacity is very low. Some counties and townships have experienced situations where fertilizers cannot be sold locally and have to be sold to other regions. Therefore, last year, despite the tight local financial situation, the regional government decided to provide freight subsidies for fertilizers supplied by the regional fertilizer plant and phosphate fertilizer plant to local rural areas. On average, 20 yuan per ton is subsidized for ammonium carbonate, and 10 yuan per ton for phosphate fertilizer. The subsidy varies based on the distance to each county, with closer areas receiving no subsidy, medium-distance areas receiving a smaller subsidy, and farther areas receiving a larger subsidy.

	The freight subsidy policy was immediately welcomed by the broad masses of farmers. Last year, the region's farmers purchased 170,000 tons of fertilizer, making it the year with the highest fertilizer usage since 1980.

　　张家口实行化肥运费补贴
    本报讯  张家口地区行署在最近召开的地产化肥订货会议上重申：从地区财政拿出８０万元资金，对供应本地边远山区农村的化肥继续实行运费补贴。
    张家口地区１２个县分布在３．４万多平方公里的土地上，地区化肥厂的化肥运到边远的农村，每吨光运费就达６０多元。而这些边远山区许多地方连温饱问题也没有解决，生产投资能力很低。有的县乡出现了化肥在本地销不动，只得销往外地的现象。为此，去年行署在地方财力十分紧张的情况下，决定对地区化肥厂和磷肥厂供应本地农村的化肥实行运费补贴，全区平均算帐，每吨碳铵补贴２０元，磷肥补贴１０元。根据各县的路途，近的不补，中距离少补，远的多补。
    运费补贴政策一出台，立即受到广大农民的欢迎。去年，全区农民购买化肥１７万吨，是１９８０年以来使用化肥最多的一年。　（曹斌　张世林）
