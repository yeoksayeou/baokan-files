U.S. Secretary of State James Baker today expressed that the United States and Japan are determined to work together to build a "new and more solid" partnership.

He said that building such a partnership involves two principles: first, the U.S. side must "firmly and consistently" take responsibility for Japan's security; second, the U.S. must maintain its leadership in the Pacific region on the basis of cooperation with Japan.

Baker made these remarks at a farewell luncheon held for Japanese Prime Minister Takeshita. Takeshita concluded his four-day visit to New York and Washington today and flew back to his country.

In his reply at today's luncheon, Takeshita said that Japan is determined to play a more active role in the entire Pacific region under U.S. leadership.

He said that this visit to the United States has deepened the relationship between Japan and the United States, and both sides are willing to work together to solve some global issues.

　　要建立更加牢固的美日关系
    新华社华盛顿２月３日电  美国国务卿詹姆斯·贝克今天表示，美国和日本决心为建立一种“崭新的、更加牢固的”伙伴关系而共同努力。
    他说，建立这种伙伴关系有两条原则：一是美国方面要“坚定不移地、持之以恒地”对日本的安全负责；二是美国要在与日本合作的基础上，保持在太平洋地区的领导地位。
    贝克是在为日本首相竹下登举行的送别午宴上说这番话的。竹下登今天结束了在纽约和华盛顿为期４天的访问，乘飞机回国。
    竹下登在今天午宴的答辞中表示，日本决心在美国的领导下，在整个太平洋地区发挥更加积极的作用。
