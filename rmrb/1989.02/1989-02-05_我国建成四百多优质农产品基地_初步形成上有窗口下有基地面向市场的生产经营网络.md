China has established over 400 high-quality agricultural product bases in the past three years. These bases produce grains, oils, fruits, vegetables, flowers, silkworm cocoons, and traditional Chinese medicines. The agricultural sector has used these bases as a foundation and, with high-quality agricultural products as the breakthrough point, implemented direct sales to markets. This has initially formed a network for the production and operation of high-quality agricultural products, with windows at the top, bases at the bottom, and a focus on the market.

Starting in 1986, the State Planning Commission, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Agriculture jointly adopted a method of combined national and local investment, investing over 400 million yuan to establish high-quality agricultural product bases. The focus was on seed breeding, technical training, high-quality and high-yield demonstrations, and post-processing of products. According to statistics from 287 projects, various seed breeding bases covering 1.288 million mu, high-quality fruit mother orchards and nurseries covering 45,000 mu, high-quality and high-yield demonstration fields (gardens) covering 657,000 mu, and training of various technical talents totaling over 150,000 people have been established. The "Qinmei Kiwi" new variety cultivated by the Xi'an Chinese Kiwi Base has a VC content 3-5 times higher than that of foreign excellent varieties. This year, 5,000 kg of fresh fruit was organized to be sold in Beijing, and it was welcomed by various hotels and restaurants in the capital.

These bases have paid attention to the combination of production, supply, and sales from the beginning. In 1986, the Ministry of Agriculture established the High-Quality Agricultural Product Development Service Center. Subsequently, 22 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, as well as municipalities with separate plans, established High-Quality Agricultural Product Development Service Centers (stations, companies). A national agricultural product development service alliance was also formed to leverage comprehensive advantages, smooth the production and sales channels, and promote the batch organization of high-quality agricultural products entering large and medium-sized cities and earning foreign exchange.

　　我国建成四百多优质农产品基地
　　初步形成上有窗口下有基地面向市场的生产经营网络
    本报讯  我国近３年已分批建成了４６０多个优质粮油、水果、蔬菜、花卉、蚕茧和中药材等商品生产基地。农业部门以这批基地为依托，以优质农产品为突破口，实行产销直挂，初步形成上有窗口、下有基地，面向市场的优质农产品生产经营网络。
    从１９８６年起，国家计委、财政部、农业部共同采取国家和地方联合投资的办法，共投资４亿多元，建立优质农产品基地，重点用于良种繁育、技术培训、优质丰产示范和产品后加工等基础建设。仅据２８７个项目的统计，共建各类良种繁育基地１２８．８万亩，优质水果母本园和苗圃４．５万亩，优质丰产示范田（园）６５．７万亩，培训各种技术人才１５万多人次。西安中华猕猴桃基地培育出的“秦美猕猴桃”新品种，ＶＣ含量高于国外优良品种的３—５倍，今年组织５０００多公斤鲜果进北京试销，受到首都各宾馆、饭店的欢迎。
    这批基地，一开始就注意产供销结合。１９８６年农业部成立了优质农产品开发服务中心，相继有江西、辽宁、内蒙古、甘肃等２２个省、市、自治区和计划单列市成立了优质农产品开发服务中心（站、公司），并组建全国性的农产品开发服务联合体，发挥综合优势，疏通了产销渠道，为批量组织优质农产品进入大中城市和出口创汇起到了促进作用。
