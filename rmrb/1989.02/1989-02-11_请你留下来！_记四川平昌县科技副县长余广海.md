In the journey of life, there are those who pursue money, status, honor, and enjoyment, but there are also those who dedicate themselves to their careers and ideals.

Yu Guanghai from Sichuan Agricultural College is such a person. He is over forty years old and is renowned nationally and internationally as a rabbit breeding expert. As a vice-professor of animal husbandry, he could have ascended to a magnificent platform… but he chose none of these. As an old party member from the 1950s, he voluntarily came to the rugged mountains of Pingchang County to shoulder the responsibility of poverty alleviation.

On January 5th, the auditorium in Desheng Town was packed with people inside and out. Deputy County Head for Science and Technology Yu Guanghai pointed to a rabbit breeding chart with his finger, speaking fluently… The auditorium was filled with thousands of farmers who sat in complete silence. Outside the window, snow and rain fell, and the cold wind howled. Those who arrived late and couldn't get into the auditorium sat on the steps in rows. From 9 AM to 3 PM, not a single person left. Someone exclaimed, “An esteemed vice-professor who has won provincial and national major science and technology awards eight times, offered a monthly salary of 500 yuan by the Zhuhai Development Company, yet he didn’t go. Instead, he delved into the poor mountain gorges, enduring hunger and cold, truly remarkable!”

How many times has Yu Guanghai experienced such enthusiastic scenes? He can no longer remember. In June of last year, his first task upon arriving in the county from Sichuan Agricultural College was to closely link production with technology training classes and scientific research classes, developing the intelligence of 700,000 farmers, and transforming scientific and technological knowledge into productive forces. In half a year, he spent four months in districts and townships, visiting the poor, surveying grasslands, and conducting training classes and scientific rabbit breeding lectures in all 61 townships and schools in the county. He trained over 140,000 technical backbones. The mountain people, thirsty for knowledge, warmly welcomed him. A 15-year-old girl wrote him a letter saying, “…That day, I listened to your report on rabbit breeding for wealth, and my palms were clapped sore. You brought us the hope of escaping poverty and becoming rich.”

“400,000,” what a heavy number! Since Yu Guanghai signed a pre-sale contract with the Deyang Frozen Rabbit Processing Plant, he has been unable to enjoy his meals or sleep peacefully. In September of last year, during the 18th International Poultry Conference in Nagoya, Japan, he had just visited the prosperous livestock and poultry market in Japan and was eager to fly back to Pingchang. He couldn’t help but write to the Livestock Bureau Director, discussing his plans to work hard after returning, asking him to prepare for the follow-up work after breeding. Upon returning to Beijing, friends invited him to climb the Great Wall and visit Fragrant Hills, but he declined all invitations, hiding in the basement to write the scientific report “Prospects and Measures for the Development of Meat Rabbit Breeding in Pingchang”; even when passing through Chengdu, he didn’t have time to visit his wife and children working in Ya’an, and before he could change out of his travel clothes, he was already traversing the rugged mountains of Ba…

Another sleepless night. Outside the window, heavy rain poured down. Yu Guanghai forgot the fatigue from his long journey from Chengdu, his mind preoccupied with the rabbit breeding specialists he had painstakingly supported. As soon as it was dawn, he hurriedly boarded a public bus, rushing to Xiantan Township to see Xian Yuewen. “County Head, 9 rabbits died, and 1,000 yuan is about to be wasted!” Before even crossing the threshold, the owner urgently informed him. Yu Guanghai’s heart skipped a beat, and he quickly took out a dissection knife. “Typical rabbit plague,” he said as he dissected, “Rescue them!” He and the owner cleaned the rabbit pens together, and then quickly gave preventive injections to 51 breeding rabbits. Beads of sweat trickled down from his furrowed brow. As soon as he finished the injections, before the owner could react, he opened his old umbrella and disappeared into the gray rain curtain…

		In His Mind, a Lingering Image

Wherever the people need him, he goes to serve. The county’s livestock and veterinary personnel lack castration skills, so he proactively goes to the countryside to conduct training classes, rolling up his sleeves and demonstrating chicken and pig castration. The people say, “In terms of rank, he doesn’t have the airs of a county head; in terms of knowledge, he is a genuine expert and professor.”

Jiu Chuanpiao, who lives on a mountain over 700 meters high, is a simple and honest farmer from Zhenlong Township. His family has several children in school, and the economic burden weighs heavily on him, causing him to frown. Yu Guanghai generously took out 400 yuan to buy 30 California breed rabbits and sent them to his home. From then on, Jiu Chuanpiao embarked on the path to prosperity. Unemployed youth Gou Jiang sought a livelihood from the “parental official,” and Yu Guanghai sent money for him to study bile pigment extraction technology at the county science association.

Those who know Yu Guanghai’s family situation ask him, “What are you after? Your monthly salary is only 127 yuan, and your wife’s salary is low. You have to support a family of five and an elderly mother in the countryside. Your finances are tight. Now you are spending money left and right, what good will it do?” Yu Guanghai smiled and said, “I am a ‘parental official’ of the people and cannot watch the masses go hungry!”

Yu Guanghai has won the trust and praise of party and government leaders and all the people of the county. A 16-year-old boy from Zhanggong Township wrote to him, “County Head Yu… as soon as you took office, you were like Li Xiangyang in the movies, everywhere in the county, and we call out, ‘Stay with us!’”

### “请你留下来！”——记四川平昌县科技副县长余广海

　　“请你留下来！”   
     ——记四川平昌县科技副县长余广海
    王才昌
    在人生途中，对金钱、地位、荣誉、享受不乏追求的人，但也有为事业、理想而献身的人。
    四川农学院余广海就是这样的人。他已过不惑之年，作为养兔专家，享誉国内外；作为畜牧副教授，他可以登上瑰丽的殿堂……然而，这些他都没有选择。作为５０年代的老党员，他自愿来到崎岖巴山的平昌县，肩负起扶贫的重任。
    　　　　报告场，爆出一阵阵掌声
    １月５日，得胜镇礼堂里里外外坐满了人，科技副县长余广海用手指着种兔挂图，滔滔不绝地讲述着……会场内，几千农民鸦雀无声。窗外，雪雨纷扬，寒风呼啸。因来晚挤不进会场一排排坐在台阶上的农民，从早晨９点到下午３点，竟没有一人离去。有人啧啧赞叹：“８次获省、国家重大科技奖的堂堂副教授，湛江开发公司每月５００元高薪聘他，不去，却钻进穷山沟忍饥度寒，了不起！”
    余广海经历这样的热烈场面有多少次了？他已经记不清。去年６月，他在四川农学院来县里办的第一件事，就是紧密结合生产办技术培训班和科学研究班，开发７０万农民智力，把科学技术转化为生产力。他上任半年，有４个多月时间泡在区乡，访寒问贫，考察草源，在全县６１个乡镇和中小学校轮流办培训班和科学养兔讲演，共培训了１４万多技术骨干。知识饥渴的山民热情欢迎他。一位年仅１５岁的小姑娘给他写信说：“……那天，我听你的养兔致富报告，巴掌都拍痛了。你给我们送来了治穷致富的希望。”
    　　　　黄泥路，留一串深深脚印
    “４０万”，这是一个多么沉重的数字！自从余广海与德阳冻兔加工厂签订了预售合同后，就食不甘味，睡不安寝。去年９月，他在日本名古屋参加第１８届国际家禽代表会期间，刚刚参观了日本繁荣的畜禽市场，就想插翅飞回平昌了。他忍不住给畜牧局长写信谈了自己回来后准备大干的想法，要他作好引种后绪工作。回到北京，朋友邀他登长城，逛香山，他一一谢绝，独自藏在地下室写《平昌发展肉兔饲养业的前景和措施》科学论证报告；途经成都也没顾着去看一眼在雅安工作的妻子、儿女，尘装未脱，又在崎岖巴山中穿行……
    又是一个不眠的夜。窗外大雨如注。余广海却忘了从成都长途跋涉的疲劳，一心挂念着他精心扶持起来的种兔专业户。天刚蒙蒙亮，他就心急火燎挤上公共汽车，赶到响滩乡鲜跃文家。“县长，兔死了９只，１０００元钱快泡水了！”没进门槛，主人就急切地告诉他。余广海心里一惊，忙掏出解剖刀。“典型兔瘟”，他边解剖边说：“抢救！”他同主人一起打扫完兔圈后，又迅速给５１只种兔打预防针。一粒粒晶莹的汗珠，从他那纵横的额纹里徐徐滴下。刚打完针，还没等主人回过神来，他又撑开了那把旧雨伞，消逝在灰蒙蒙的雨帘中……
    　　　　脑海里，有一个萦回的形象
    人民事业哪里需要他，他就到哪里去服务。县上畜牧兽医人员阉割技术差，他主动下乡办培训班，袖子一挽，执刀阉鸡阉猪作示范。老百姓说，论“官”，他没有县长的架子；论知识，他是个实打实的专家教授。
    生活在海拔７００多米高山上的朱传飘，是镇龙乡老实巴交的农民，家里几个孩子读书，经济重担使他愁眉不展。余广海慷慨解囊，拿出４００元钱买回３０只加利福尼亚良种兔送到他家里，从此朱传飘走上了富裕之路，待业青年苟江向“父母官”求生活出路，余广海寄钱让他到县科协学习提取胆红素技术。
    了解余广海家庭情况的人问他：“你图的什么？月薪才１２７元，妻子工资又低，要养活全家５口人和在农村的老母亲，经济不宽余。你现在大把大把票子往外花，能有什么好处？”余广海笑着说：“我是人民的‘父母官’不能看着群众缺衣少吃！”
    余广海赢得了党政领导干部和全县人民的信任和赞誉。张公乡一位１６岁的少年给他写信：“余县长……你一上任就像电影里的李向阳，全县到处都有你，我们呼唤：‘请你留下来！’”
