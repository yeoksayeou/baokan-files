The Soviet Scientific Community in the Midst of Reform
— An Interview with the President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, G. Marchuk

By Fang Rongxuan, Correspondent of People's Daily

G. Marchuk, President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, who has been awarded the Lenin Prize four times, is renowned worldwide for his outstanding contributions to science. He is a distinguished scientist in the fields of computational mathematics, atmospheric physics, geophysics, and nuclear reactor physics. He has led the Siberian Branch for many years, establishing the Soviet school of computational and applied mathematics; he formulated the comprehensive plan known as "Siberia," making significant contributions to the development of Soviet science. His strong sense of mission, responsibility, and remarkable work capacity are highly praised by his peers.

During the visit of the Soviet Academy of Sciences delegation to China, I had the honor of meeting this renowned scientist. He was elegant, approachable, and enthusiastically answered my questions.

When discussing the reforms of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, President Marchuk said, "We are also undergoing reforms. First, we emphasize the cultivation and promotion of talent and the rejuvenation of the leadership. Among the 330 academicians and 660 corresponding members, more than 200 are over 75 years old. Previously, it was stipulated that only after the death of an academician could a new one be elected. Now we propose to the Party Central Committee and the government that academicians and corresponding members who reach 75 years old should no longer occupy their seats. In the last election, the average age of academicians has significantly decreased. Of course, academicians who retire due to age still retain their original titles and material benefits. The maximum age for academicians holding administrative positions is set at 65. In the last election of the Academy's Presidium, the average age of the elected members and the heads of various departments is 20 years younger than before. Another example is that the recently elected vice-presidents of the Academy are almost all around 50 years old."

President Marchuk emphasized that democratization in various research institutes is an important aspect of the reform. For a long time, the leadership of various research institutes was not composed of the most capable people but of those who were favored by the director. Now, democratization is being promoted in various research institutes, and democratic elections are being implemented. Several candidates must submit written applications and propose specific plans for future scientific work. Finally, a general meeting of all personnel in the institute is held to elect the director candidates through secret voting, and all situations are reported to the department, which then elects the director through secret voting. Afterwards, the institute elects the scientific committee through secret voting by all personnel. All policies and personnel decisions must be made through the scientific committee and cannot be decided by the director alone. Last year, in the second half of the year, 150 directors were elected, and they are all relatively young and promising.

President Marchuk introduced that another aspect closely related to the reform is the decentralization of management authority. The Presidium of the Academy consists of 46 members, but it cannot handle everything. We have decided to delegate personnel, financial, and international exchange powers to the institute level.

He said, "An important aspect of the reform is the change in the previous funding system. Previously, funds were allocated to research institutions, but in the future, funds will mainly be allocated directly to specific research projects. This can ensure that financial, material, and human resources are concentrated on priority research projects. Of course, to ensure basic research, 1/3 of the funds are still allocated to various research institutes. Research institutes must undertake tasks proposed by the Presidium of the Academy and its various departments through a competitive mechanism to obtain funding. Starting this year, the Academy will implement 18 major basic research projects."

Regarding the development of inter-departmental scientific and technological integration, can you talk about that? the reporter asked.

"This is a very interesting form," he emphasized, "it breaks the constraints of vertical and horizontal divisions, and this form now has 24 nationwide, and there will be more in the future."

Finally, President Marchuk shared his views on the "prospects for Sino-Soviet scientific and technological cooperation."

"Limitless potential, bright future," he summarized in two sentences. He couldn't help but sigh, "Originally, academic exchanges between the two countries were very good, but for various reasons, they were interrupted for 30 years! Now we want to develop bilateral and multilateral cooperation. We should gradually and step by step develop exchanges."

Finally, President Marchuk shared his thoughts on this visit. He highly praised and expressed his desire to study and learn from China's investment in providing necessary guarantees for basic scientific research; from our bridging scientific research and production through companies to quickly apply research results to production; and from our scientific and technological market.

### 改革中的苏联科技界——访苏联科学院院长马尔丘克

　　改革中的苏联科技界
    ——访苏联科学院院长马尔丘克
    本报记者  方荣萱
    曾４次被授予列宁勋章的苏联科学院院长古·马尔丘克，以他在科学上的杰出建树享有世界声誉。他是计算数学、大气物理、地理物理和核反应堆物理等方面的著名科学家。他曾在西伯利亚总分院从事多年的领导工作，建立了苏联计算数学和应用数学学派；制定了命名为“西伯利亚”的规模宏大的综合规划，为发展苏联的科学事业作出了重大贡献。这位科学家高度的使命感、责任心和惊人的工作能力更为同行们称道。
    马尔丘克院长率领苏联科学院代表团来华访问期间，记者有幸走访了这位著名科学家。他风度翩翩，平易近人，热情地回答了记者的提问。
    在谈到苏联科学院体制改革的情况时，马尔丘克院长说，我们科学院也在进行改革。我们首先强调培养、提拔人才和领导班子年轻化问题。在３３０位院士和６６０位通讯院士中，有２００多位超过了７５岁。过去规定，只有在一位院士去世以后有空缺才可递补。现在我们向党中央和政府建议，院士和通讯院士达到７５岁就不再占院士和通讯院士席位。在上一次选举时，院士平均年龄明显下降了。当然，因年老而退下来的院士仍保留原有的荣誉称号和物质待遇。担任行政领导职务的院士最高年龄限定为６５岁。在上次科学院主席团选举中，我们已选出的主席团成员的平均年龄与我们各学部负责人的平均年龄均比以前年轻了２０岁。再举一个例子，最近选出的科学院副院长差不多都是５０岁左右。
    马尔丘克院长强调指出，在各研究所大力推行的民主化是改革的一个重要方面。长期以来，各研究所的领导班子不是由最有才干的人组成，而是由所长称心的人组成。现在在各研究所推行民主化，实行民主选举。几位候选人都应提交书面申请，提出未来科学计划的具体方案，最后举行研究所全体人员大会，通过秘密投票选举所长候选人，所有情况报学部，再通过学部秘密投票选定所长。以后，研究所再通过全体人员秘密投票选举所的科学委员会。一切方针、人事决定要通过科学委员会，不能由所长一人说了算。去年下半年已选了１５０名所长，他们都是较年轻有为的。
    马尔丘克院长介绍说，再有一方面与改革密切相关的，就是管理权力的下放。科学院主席团由４６位成员组成，但不能包揽一切，我们决定把人权、财权、国际交流权都下放到所部层次。
    他说，一个很重要方面的改革，就是改变了过去的拨款制度。过去是向科研机构拨款，今后则主要将资金直接拨给具体的研究课题。这样可以保证将财力、物质技术和劳动资源集中用于优先研究的项目。当然，为了保证基础研究，还有１／３的资金拨给各研究所。各研究所要按竞争机制承担科学院主席团及其各学部提出的任务，才能取得拨款。从今年起，科学院开始实施１８项重大基础研究项目。
    关于跨部门的科技综合体的发展情况，您能谈谈吗，记者问。
    “这是个非常有趣的形式”，他强调说，它打破了条条、块块的束缚，这种形式现在全国有２４个，将来会越来越多。
    最后，马尔丘克院长就记者提出的“中苏科技合作前景”发表了自己的看法。
    “潜力无限，前途光明”，他概括为两句话说。他不无感慨地说，本来两国学术交流非常好，可是由于种种原因中断了３０年！现在我们要发展双边、多边合作。应该逐渐地、一步一步地发展交流。
    最后，马尔丘克院长谈了谈这次访问的感想。他对我国从投资方面给基础科学研究以必要的保障；对我们科研与生产之间通过公司搭桥使科研成果尽快用于生产以及我国的科技市场等，都倍加赞扬并表示要研究学习。
