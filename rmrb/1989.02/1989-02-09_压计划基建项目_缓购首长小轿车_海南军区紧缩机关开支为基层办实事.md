Recently, the Hainan Military Region has allocated 551.9 million yuan, saved from cleaning up construction projects, reducing administrative expenditures, and squeezing out production revenues, entirely for grassroots construction.

At the beginning of this year, the commander of the Hainan Military Region, Pang Weiqiang, and the political commissar, Liu Guinan, conducted an investigation into the grassroots construction of subordinate units. They found that a lack of funds was a prominent issue. Under their initiative, the military region held an expanded party committee meeting and decided to "tighten the belt" of the headquarters to make life a bit easier for the companies. They decisively halted all 8 projects that were under construction within the plan, saving over 400 million yuan. The relevant departments originally planned to replace some of the "overdue" cars for the military region's senior officials, but now the plan has been revised. In recent years, the headquarters has earned nearly 100 million yuan from production and operations. Last summer, they planned to use this money to renovate the headquarters' barracks. After the military region's party committee announced this decision, the departments of the commander, political commissar, and rear services immediately took out all the money as subsidies for grassroots rations.

Currently, various funds raised by the military region's headquarters have begun to be allocated to specific units and projects. The military region's party committee requires the relevant departments to focus on effectiveness when using this money and not to issue "blank checks."

　　海南军区紧缩机关开支为基层办实事
    本报讯  最近，海南军区把清理基建项目、压缩机关行政开支和从生产收益中挤出的５５１．９万元全部花在基层建设上。
    今年初，海南军区司令员庞为强、政委刘桂楠对所属部队基层建设进行调查，认为资金缺乏是突出难题。在他们的倡导下，军区召开党委扩大会，决定机关“腰带”再紧一个“扣眼”，让连队的日子好过点。他们果断把计划内在建的８项工程全部停下来，省下资金４００多万元。有关部门原计划为军区首长更换部分“超期服役”的小轿车，现在重新修订了计划。这几年军区机关靠生产经营有了近百万元的收入，去年夏天就准备用这笔钱修缮机关营房。军区党委决定公布后，司、政、后各部门立即将钱全部拿出作为基层伙食补贴。
    目前，军区机关筹措的各类款项已经开始拨往具体单位和项目。军区党委要求有关部门在用这笔钱时，要注重实效，不开“空头支票”。
