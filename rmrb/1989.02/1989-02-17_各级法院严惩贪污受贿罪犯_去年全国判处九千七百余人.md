Courts at all levels across the country have given high priority to combating serious economic crimes, particularly cases of embezzlement and bribery involving state officials in government agencies and enterprises. In 1988, a total of 9,720 embezzlement cases and 1,930 bribery cases were accepted, resulting in the conviction of 9,726 offenders.

From the cases handled by the courts last year, it is evident that the number of embezzlement and bribery cases involving large sums of money has increased significantly. There were 234 cases where the embezzled amount exceeded 500,000 yuan, with the highest amount reaching 3,340,000 yuan. Additionally, there were 21 cases where the bribery amount exceeded 500,000 yuan.

Analysis shows that many embezzlement and bribery cases involved multiple perpetrators, often with internal employees colluding with external criminals. The methods used in these crimes have become more complex and cunning. Some offenders, once they succeed, flee with large sums of money and indulge in extravagant spending, causing significant economic losses to the state and collective entities.

Judicial authorities have shown no leniency towards serious economic criminals with conclusive evidence, firmly adhering to severe punishment. Zhou Huaguang, a deputy director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, took advantage of his position to facilitate the donation of cars by overseas Chinese, accepting bribes totaling 138,000 yuan for 177 car donation cases. In June 1988, with the approval of the Supreme People's Court, Zhou Huaguang was sentenced to death.

During the trial of such cases, courts at all levels have found that many embezzlement and bribery crimes were facilitated by poor management and lax regulations within certain units. Some units lacked clear guidelines, while others had guidelines but did not follow them. Some units even hired so-called "experts" (who were actually lawbreakers) to manage economic powers. In response to these issues, the courts, while severely punishing criminals, have also promptly provided judicial suggestions to relevant departments and units, urging them to strengthen management and plug loopholes.

According to statistics, in 1988, courts at all levels across the country handled a total of 55,500 serious economic crime cases, convicting 74,600 offenders. They strictly adhered to the policy of severely punishing those who seriously disrupt the economy, promptly and legally punishing a large number of criminals.

In handling economic crime cases, the people's courts have paid special attention to strictly distinguishing between criminal and non-criminal acts. For those whose crimes are proven, they are firmly and severely punished according to the law. For cases where the facts are not clear and the evidence is not sufficient, they do not rush to judgment but insist on clarifying the facts before making a conclusion. For those who have not committed criminal acts, even if they have made mistakes or errors in their work, they insist on declaring them not guilty. Thus, they have effectively combated economic crimes while ensuring that innocent people are not subjected to criminal prosecution, avoiding wrongful convictions.

### 各级法院严惩贪污受贿罪犯  去年全国判处九千七百余人

　　各级法院严惩贪污受贿罪犯    
    去年全国判处九千七百余人
    本报北京２月１６日讯  全国各级人民法院在打击严重经济犯罪斗争中，对于发生在党政机关和企事业单位国家工作人员中的贪污、受贿等犯罪给予高度重视，１９８８年共受理贪污案９７２０件，受贿案１９３０件，共判处罪犯９７２６人。
    从去年法院审结的贪污、受贿案件可以看出，贪污、受贿数额巨大的案件明显增多。贪污数额５万元以上的有２３４人（其中包括挪用公款以贪污罪论处的），数额最多的竟达３３４万元，受贿数额在５万元以上的有２１人。
    据分析，贪污、受贿案件中，有不少是多人共同作案，有许多案件都是内部职工与外部犯罪分子互相勾结作案。在犯罪手段上，也较之以往更为复杂和狡猾，有些罪犯一旦得手，即携巨款潜逃大肆挥霍，使国家、集体蒙受重大经济损失。
    审判机关对证据确凿的严重经济犯罪分子，毫不手软，坚决从严惩处。广西壮族自治区侨办正处级干部周华光利用负责办理侨胞捐赠汽车手续的便利，大肆收受贿赂，为一些单位办理捐赠汽车手续１７７件（辆），周华光索贿、受贿达１３．８万余元。去年６月，经最高人民法院核准，周华光被判处死刑。
    各级人民法院在审理这类案件时，发现不少贪污、受贿犯罪所以得逞，都与一些单位的管理不善、制度不严有密切关系。有的是无章可循，有的则是有章不循，有的聘请所谓“能人”（实为违法犯罪分子）来掌管经济权力。针对这种情况，人民法院在严惩犯罪的同时，还及时向有关部门和单位提出司法建议，督促其加强管理、堵塞漏洞。
    另据统计，去年一年，全国各级审判机关共审结各类严重经济犯罪案件５．５５万件，判处人犯７．４６万名，坚决贯彻了对严重破坏经济的罪犯依法从严惩处的方针，及时依法惩处了大批犯罪分子。
    人民法院在审判经济犯罪案件中，特别注意严格区分罪与非罪的界限，凡是查证属实的犯罪分子，都坚决依法从严判处，对于那些事实尚不够清楚，证据尚不够确凿充分的案件，则不草率判决，坚持查清后再下结论。凡是未触犯刑律的，即使在工作中发生了某些错误或失误，仍坚持宣告无罪。从而，既有力地打击了经济犯罪活动，又有效地保证了无罪的人不受刑事追究，避免了冤假错案的发生。
