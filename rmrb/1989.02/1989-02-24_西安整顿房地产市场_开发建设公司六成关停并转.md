Xi'an Cleans Up Real Estate Market

    Sixty Percent of Development Companies to Close, Merge, or Convert

    According to Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, February 23 (Reporter Wang Jianren) The Xi'an Municipal Urban and Rural Construction Commission is currently rectifying the chaotic real estate market. A responsible official recently stated that out of the original 50-plus real estate development and construction companies in the city, 60% will be closed, merged, or converted to other industries.

    According to the "Xi'an City Construction Planning Management Measures" and relevant regulations, 20 companies with strong assets, technology, and equipment, that genuinely possess comprehensive urban real estate development capabilities and have relatively good management, have obtained the "Xi'an City Urban Real Estate Comprehensive Development Certificate" and will continue to operate. The remaining dozens of real estate development companies will no longer undertake new development and construction projects. After the original approving units, in conjunction with the urban construction department, have completed the clearance of their ongoing projects and legacy issues, these companies will be dissolved or merged.

    It is understood that the original 50-plus real estate development companies in Xi'an have various issues. Some lack clear separation between government and enterprise, some only seek profits, some lack funds and technical personnel, and management is chaotic. Wild demolition of residential buildings has disrupted the order of urban real estate development, causing some residents to wait five or six years for new housing after their old homes are demolished.

　　西安整顿房地产市场
    开发建设公司六成关停并转
    据中新社西安２月２３日电  （记者王建仁）西安市城乡建设委员会正在整顿混乱的房屋地产市场。一位负责官员最近说，全市原有房地产开发建设公司５０多家中的６０％将宣告关闭、合并或转换产业。
    按照西安市《城市建设规划管理办法》及有关法规，资产、技术、设备力量比较雄厚，确实具备城市房地产综合开发能力而又管理得较好的２０家公司，已获得《西安市城镇房地产综合开发证书》，继续营业。其余数十家房地产开发公司不再承担新的开发和建设工程，待原批准单位会同城建部门对其在建项目和遗留问题清理结束后撤销或并转。
    据了解，西安市原有５０多家房地产开发公司，有的政企不分，有的只贪图赢利，有的缺乏资金和技术人员，管理混乱，野蛮拆迁居民住房，扰乱了城市房地产开发业秩序，使一些居民旧房拆除长达五六年住不上新房。
