The year's plan hinges on the spring. Recently, Guangdong's rural areas have seen a bustling scene of agricultural infrastructure development.

Since the winter, the province has focused on transforming low- and medium-yield fields on an unprecedented scale in recent years. Over 800 million laborers have been mobilized across the province, and more than 1.1 million acres of low- and medium-yield fields have been initially transformed. According to incomplete statistics from 13 cities, the municipal and county governments have invested over 15 million yuan in agricultural funds, an increase of more than fivefold compared to last year.

After the autumn harvest last year, various regions in Guangdong have taken strong measures to boost agricultural production. Foshan City, known for its rapid industrial growth, has decided to allocate 10% to 12% of its local fiscal budget to agriculture and to use part of the newly levied budgetary adjustment tax for agricultural purposes.

The cities of Dongguan and Zhongshan, and the counties of Sanshui and Gaoyao, known as the "four major granaries of Guangdong," have taken new measures to reverse the recent decline in grain production. Dongguan City is transforming 50,000 acres of poorly managed, low-yield shrimp ponds and banana fields into rice fields, ensuring that the grain planting area this year will not be less than 1.3 million acres. The city has also mandated that each town (district) allocate at least 10% of its fiscal budget to agricultural investment, ensuring adequate funding for grain production. Zhongshan City, located at the mouth of the Pearl River, has raised 15 million yuan from various sources, including municipal, town (district), and township enterprises, as a development fund for agricultural production. This fund will support grain production through low-interest or interest-free loans.

　　广东农田基本建设蓬勃开展    
    入冬以来改造中低产田百万亩
    本报讯  记者梁兆明报道：一年之计在于春。近日，广东农村出现一派农田基本建设繁忙景象。
    入冬以来，全省以改造中低产田为中心的农田基本建设，规模之大为近年所少见。全省投入劳动力超过８００万人，已初步改造中低产田１１０万多亩。据１３个市的不完全统计，市、县财政投入支农资金１５００多万元，比去年增加５倍多。
    在去年秋收以后，广东省各地纷纷采取有力措施，给农业生产发展加温。以工业生产递增速度快而出名的佛山市，决定在市级地方财政开支中，划出１０％至１２％的专款投入农业，并把新开征的预算外资金调节税中的一部分用于农业。
    素有南粤“四大粮仓”之称的东莞、中山两市和三水、高要两县，为改变近年来粮食生产“偏冷”局面，积极采取新措施。东莞市有５万亩管理差、效益低的虾塘蕉田正陆续改种水稻，确保今年粮食播种面积不少于１３０万亩，并规定各镇（区）财政对农业投资比例达到１０％以上，使粮食生产有较充足的资金。地处珠江口的中山市，从市、镇（区）和乡镇企业及其它渠道筹集１５００万元，作为农业生产发展基金，以低息或无息贷款支持发展粮食生产。
