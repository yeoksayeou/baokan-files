	Promoting Civilized Business Practices and Eliminating Fraud
	Fuzhou Selects "No Counterfeit Goods Sales Units"

	People's Daily reports: In early February, a plaque reading "No Counterfeit Goods Sales Unit" was hung at the entrance of the Dongjiekou Department Store in Fuzhou. This is the first store in Fuzhou to receive this honor as part of the city's "No Counterfeit Goods Sales Units" campaign. This activity was organized by the Fuzhou Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce, Consumer Council, and Commercial Bureau in the fourth quarter of last year.

	Units participating in the selection activity signed agreements with the Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce, Consumer Council, and relevant departments to ensure that goods pass through three checks: procurement, inspection, and shelf placement. They are prohibited from selling the following types of goods: counterfeit goods, substandard goods, goods with forged trademarks, and goods with fake brand names; industrial products without quality inspection or certification; goods where the quality certification, instructions, quality marks, or certification marks do not match the actual quality of the product; expired, spoiled, or obsolete goods; goods without a company name or address (place of origin); and mid-to-high-end household appliances without a trademark.

	Fuzhou Dongjiekou Department Store, a famous commercial enterprise in Fujian Province, was the first to sign an agreement with the Bureau of Industry and Commerce and other departments to participate in the "No Counterfeit Goods Sales Units" campaign. According to the agreement, the store established and improved various systems, assigned responsibilities at all levels, and implemented the campaign at every position, ensuring clear responsibilities and reward and punishment mechanisms. The store conducted self-inspections and consultations with the industry and commerce departments for any questionable goods. Staff members studied relevant trademark laws and provincial regulations on protecting consumers' legal rights, enhancing their awareness of protecting consumers' interests.

　　提倡文明经商　杜绝弄虚作假   
    福州评选“无假冒商品销售单位”
    本报讯  记者张铭清报道：２月初，一块“无假冒商品销售单位”的匾牌挂在了福州东街口百货大楼门口。这是福州市开展“无假冒商品销售单位”活动中，第一个获得这一称号的商店。这项活动是由福州市工商局、消费者委员会和商业局于去年四季度开始组织的。
    参加评选活动的单位与市工商局、消费者委员会及主管部门签订协议，做到商品进出把住进货、验收、上柜三道关，不销售以下各种商品：以假充真、以次充好、伪造商标、假冒名牌商品；无质量检验、无合格证的工业商品；合格证、说明书、优质标志、认证标志与产品的实际质量水平不一致的商品；变质、过期失效和明令淘汰的商品；无企业名牌、无地址（产地）的商品；无商标的中高档家用电器。
    福建省著名的商业企业福州东街口百货大楼，率先与工商局等签订了开展“无假冒商品销售单位”活动的协议，按照协议规定，建立健全各项制度，层层分解责任，把这一活动落实到每个岗位，做到责任明确，奖罚兑现。这个商店通过自检自查，对有疑问的商品主动向工商部门咨询。干部、职工认真学习有关商标法和省保护消费者合法权益等法规，增强了保护消费者利益的观念。
