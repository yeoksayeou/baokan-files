The Ministry of Light Industry has implemented a production permit system for skincare cosmetics, the first of its kind in the daily chemical industry. This was learned by reporters at the National Cosmetic Production Permit Issuance Conference held in Hangzhou today.

In recent years, China's cosmetics industry has developed rapidly. By the end of last year, there were nearly 2,000 skincare product enterprises nationwide. Some of these enterprises lack the necessary technology and equipment, and cannot guarantee product quality. Some unscrupulous individual vendors also sell large quantities of counterfeit and substandard cosmetics containing harmful substances. These substandard and counterfeit products entering the market pose a threat to consumers' health.

It is understood that a total of 654 cosmetics enterprises have obtained the first batch of skincare cosmetics production permits issued by the Ministry of Light Industry. Relevant departments have stipulated that it is strictly forbidden to produce these types of products without a permit.

　　护肤类化妆品无证不准生产
    轻工部实行许可证制度
    新华社杭州２月２３日电  （记者何玲玲、通讯员楼建民）轻工业部在日用化工行业中首次对护肤类化妆品实行生产许可证制度，这是记者从今天在杭州召开的全国化妆品生产许可证发放会议上获悉的。
    近年来，我国化妆品行业发展迅猛。到去年底，单是含护肤类产品的化妆品企业全国就有近２０００家。其中一些企业既无技术又少设备，缺乏必要的生产、检测设备，根本无法保证产品质量。一些不法个体商贩也大量抛售含有毒物品的假冒伪劣化妆品。这些劣质假冒商品进入市场，危害消费者的健康。
    据了解，全国共有６５４家化妆品企业首批获得轻工业部发放的护肤类化妆品生产许可证。有关部门同时规定，一律不许无证生产这类产品。
