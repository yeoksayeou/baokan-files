    Such "Civilized Business Practices"
    A banner reading "Civilized Operation Demonstration Counter" hangs in the store, but in front of the counter, an uncivilized "battle" is taking place. The phenomenon of forced buying and selling frequently occurs in some stores in Guiyang City. On January 31, Chen Guohui, an employee of the Meitan County Comprehensive Trade Company in Guizhou Province, went to the First Bathhouse Store on Huaxiang South Road in Guiyang City to buy a coat. After examining the goods, Chen Guohui decided not to buy, but the salesperson, Wan Chaoying, spoke rudely and, together with two other store employees, started fighting with the customer. Wan Chaoying was immediately taken to the Huaxiang South Road Police Station to receive an administrative penalty. The other two employees involved in the fight saw this and fled. The police officers, based on the photos taken by the reporter on the spot, found the fugitives.

    如此“文明经商”
    店堂里挂着“文明经营示范柜”的横幅，柜台前却是一场不文明的“混战”。强买强卖的现象在贵阳市一些商店经常发生。1月31日，贵州省湄潭县综合贸易公司职工陈国卉（左二），来到贵阳市中华南路第一浴室商店买风衣，看货后陈国卉提出不买，营业员万朝英（右二）出口伤人，并伙同商店两名职工扭打顾客。万朝英当即被送到中华南路派出所接受治安处罚。另外两名扭打顾客的当事者见状逃之夭夭。派出所的同志根据记者现场抓拍的照片找回了逃跑者。
