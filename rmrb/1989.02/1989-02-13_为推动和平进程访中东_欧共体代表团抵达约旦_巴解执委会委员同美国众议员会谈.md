For promoting the peace process in the Middle East, a delegation from the European Community arrived in Jordan.

	The head of the delegation, Spanish Foreign Minister Fernandez, said at a press conference today that the visit to the Middle East is aimed at promoting the peace process in the region.

	Fernandez said that currently, "we are trying to find the possibility of convening an international peace conference on the Middle East issue."

	He emphasized the European Community's position on the Middle East issue, saying that the Middle East peace international conference should be convened under the auspices of the United Nations, with the participation of the five permanent members of the Security Council and all relevant parties.

	He pointed out that the PLO should participate in the conference. Without the participation of the Palestinian people, the Palestinian issue cannot be resolved. He also said that the European Community will not exert pressure on Israel, but will persuade Israel to make concessions.

	During the visit, King Hussein of Jordan met with the entire delegation today. He praised the European Community for playing an important role in resolving the Middle East issue.

	The European Community delegation is led by Spanish Foreign Minister Fernandez, with members including Greek Foreign Minister Paplias and French Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Dima. They arrived in Amman on the 10th and 11th respectively and began a two-day visit to Jordan on the 11th.

	According to a report by the Palestinian News Agency, PLO Executive Committee member Abu al-Rub met with U.S. Congressman and Chairman of the Middle East Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives, Owens, on the evening of the 10th to discuss the recent developments in the Middle East and the situation in the occupied territories. Owens is currently in Tunis and is preparing to continue talks with Palestinian leaders.
