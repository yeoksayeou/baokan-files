	Today's Angola
	By Yang Rusheng, Correspondent of this newspaper

	Due to the delay of the Angola Airlines flight, when the reporter arrived at Luanda Airport, it was already midnight. Soldiers with guns were everywhere, and the security checks for passengers were particularly strict. Through the dim night lights, one could vaguely see a row of MiG aircraft parked at one end of the airport. Driving into the city, one would occasionally encounter military vehicles speeding by, and sometimes one could hear a few gunshots. The comrade who came to pick me up said that Luanda still imposes a curfew after midnight, and those were the military police warning vehicles that refused to be checked. All of this indicates that the country is still far from peaceful.

	The Scars of War

	Angola is a beautiful and rich country that has also suffered many disasters. Before independence, Portuguese colonizers ruled Angola for over 500 years. To fight for national freedom and liberation, the Angolan people waged a long and unyielding struggle, finally welcoming their independence in 1975.

	However, after independence, the Angolan people did not live in peace and happiness. Thirteen years of civil war and frequent invasions by South African troops brought another disaster to this young country. The Central Committee of the People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola—Labor Party's Department of Propaganda, Director Pinto Joao, told the reporter during an interview that the continuous wars had caused this country a loss of $12 billion, in addition to 60,000 deaths, 50,000 injuries, 600,000 displaced, and 150,000 refugees abroad. Farmlands lay in ruins, industries were in decline, markets were sluggish, goods were scarce, prices were soaring, and the national economy was in a state of "complete crisis."

	Whether in the capital Luanda or in other cities, the destruction brought by the war is evident everywhere. The high-rise buildings and villas on both sides of the streets, due to years of neglect, appear old and dilapidated. Almost all shops are closed. The country's railways and road transport are basically paralyzed, and the only safe means of transportation between the capital and the provinces is by air. In Lobito City, the reporter visited the headquarters of the Benguela Railway. General Manager Silange said with regret that this major transportation artery in southern Africa had been completely destroyed, with bridges blown up, rails torn up, locomotives burned, and railway workers killed. Now the transportation volume is less than one-tenth of what it was before independence. During a visit to the Benguela Textile Factory, the general manager introduced that southern Angola was originally an important cotton-producing area, but due to the war and the destruction of the reservoir, farmers could not carry out normal production, and the factory had to spend a large amount of foreign exchange to purchase cotton from abroad.

	The Angolan people have suffered greatly from the war and desperately hope to live in peace.

	Hope and Potential

	"Without war, Angola could be one of the richest countries in Africa," a representative of an international organization stationed in Luanda told the reporter. Angola is indeed a fertile land with great potential for economic development.

	Angola is vast, with a land area of over 1.24 million square kilometers, approximately equal to the combined area of England, France, and Spain, and 14 times that of its former colonial power, Portugal.

	Angola has a good climate. Although it is near the equator, due to its high altitude and the influence of the Benguela cold current, the climate is not hot, making it a "country of spring." The capital Luanda is not only an important port but also a famous tourist destination, with lush trees, beautiful flowers, golden sands, and blue waves, and tall buildings all blending together. Angola's coffee and sisal production once ranked second in Africa, but in recent years, due to the war, production has greatly decreased. We visited a banana plantation where agricultural workers were loading freshly picked bananas onto a truck, each bunch weighing dozens of kilograms. The farm manager told the reporter that they were negotiating with some European countries to export bananas, and samples had already been sent. Near the Benguela Airport, I saw a cotton tree as thick as a basin, with green buds, yellow flowers, and white fluff, all hanging from the branches. It is said that this cotton tree has been growing for several years, which speaks to the fertility of the land.

	Angola's underground resources are even richer. Cabinda is a famous oil-producing area, known as "Little Kuwait." In addition to Cabinda, the northern coastal basin of Angola almost all contains rich oil and natural gas. We flew from Benguela to Cabinda in a small plane that could carry six people, flying along the Angolan coastline for two hours. We occasionally saw oil platforms floating on the sea, and the burning flames on the sea added a splash of orange to the green sea. Due to years of civil war, Angola's industry is in decline, with only the oil industry standing out. In 1980, Angola produced 130,000 barrels of crude oil per day, which increased to 200,000 barrels in 1984, and reached 400,000 barrels by the end of 1987. Angola's oil production ranks second in sub-Saharan African countries, after Nigeria. In addition to oil, the iron ore in Cassinga, the diamonds in northern Lunda, and the marble in Namibe are also famous and await exploitation.

	To restore the economy on the brink of collapse, the Angolan government has made unremitting efforts in adjusting the economic structure and gradually shifting the focus of the national economy from "everything for the war" to peaceful construction. It proposed to invest in the development of coffee, diamonds, and timber production while continuing to focus on oil production, aiming to achieve diversification of export products. Based on the summary of experience and lessons, in August 1987, it formulated the "Economic and Financial Rectification Guidelines."

	The new economic policy openly acknowledges the errors and deviations in economic work, emphasizing the need to start from history and reality to confirm the status of the economy and the necessity of developing economic and trade relations with the West. The announcement of the new economic policy, to a certain extent, signifies that Angola will strive to break away from rigid models and actively explore a development path suitable for its national conditions. Undoubtedly, this will have a profound impact on Angola's future economic and political situation.

　　今日安哥拉
    本报记者  杨汝生
    由于安哥拉航空公司的飞机晚点，当记者抵达罗安达机场时，已是午夜时分了。机场上到处都有持枪的士兵把守，对旅客的安全检查格外严格，透过朦胧的夜光，隐约可见停在机场一端的一排米格飞机。乘车进入市区，不时可遇呼啸而过的军车，偶尔还可听到几声枪响。前来迎接的同志对我说，罗安达午夜之后仍然实行宵禁，那是军警在鸣枪警告那些拒绝盘查的车辆。这一切都说明，这个国家还很不平静。
    　　　　战争的创伤
    安哥拉是个美丽富饶而又是多灾多难的国家。独立之前，葡萄牙殖民者曾统治安哥拉５００余年。为了争取民族的自由和解放，安哥拉人民进行了长期的不屈不挠的斗争，终于在１９７５年迎来了自己的独立。
    可是，独立以后，安哥拉人民并未过上和平幸福的生活，１３年内战和南非军队的频繁入侵，使这个新生的国家又蒙受另一场灾难。安哥拉人民解放运动——劳动党中央宣传部长平托若奥在接见记者时说，连年战争给这个国家造成的损失高达１２０亿美元，此外还有６万人死亡，５万人致残，６０万人背井离乡，１５万人流亡国外。农田荒芜，工业凋敞，市场萧条，商品匮乏，物价飞涨，国家经济处于“全面危机之中”。
    不论是在首都罗安达，还是在其他城市，战争带来的破坏随处可见。大街两侧的高楼和别墅，因年久失修，显得陈旧破烂。商店几乎全部关闭。全国的铁路和公路运输基本上中断，首都与外省唯一安全的交通工具是飞机。在洛比托市，记者访问了本格拉铁路总部，总经理西兰格先生十分惋惜地说，这条南部非洲的交通大动脉已遭到彻底破坏，桥梁被炸，铁轨被撬，机车被烧，铁路职工被杀，现在的运输量还不及独立前的十分之一。在参观本格拉纺织厂时，总经理介绍说，安哥拉南部本来是重要的产棉基地，但因战乱、水库被破坏，农民无法进行正常生产，这个厂只好花费大量外汇从外国购买棉花。
    安哥拉人民饱尝战乱之苦，迫切地期望能过上和平的生活。
    　　　　希望与潜力
    “若是没有战争，安哥拉可能是非洲最富有的国家之一。”一位常驻罗安达的国际机构的代表这样对记者说。安哥拉的确是一块富庶的国土，有着发展经济的巨大潜力。
    安哥拉幅员辽阔，领土面积为１２４万多平方公里，约为英、法和西班牙的总和，是其宗主国葡萄牙的１４倍。
    安哥拉气候良好。它虽临近赤道，但因地势较高，又受本格拉寒流的影响，气候并不炎热，是个“春天的国度”。首都罗安达不仅是重要的港口，而且是有名的旅游胜地，绿树繁花，金沙碧浪和高楼大厦交相辉映。安哥拉的咖啡和剑麻产量曾一度占非洲第二位，只是近年由于战乱，产量才大大减少。我们参观了一个香蕉园，农业工人正把采摘下来的香蕉往汽车上装，每一串都有几十公斤重。农场负责人告诉记者，他们正与欧洲某些国家谈判出口香蕉，样品已经送去。在本格拉机场附近，我见到一棵碗口粗的棉花树，绿的蕾，黄的花，白的絮，一团团、一簇簇挂满枝头，据说这棵棉花树已经生长了好几年，足见土地之肥沃。
    安哥拉的地下资源更为丰富，卡宾达是有名的石油产区，人称“小科威特”。除卡宾达外，安北部沿海盆地几乎都蕴藏着丰富的石油和天然气。我们乘６个人坐的小飞机从本格拉去卡宾达，沿安哥拉海岸线飞行了２个小时，不时可以见到一座座采油平台浮在海面，那熊熊燃烧的天火给这碧绿的大海抹上一道桔红。由于连年内战，安哥拉工业凋敝，只有石油工业一枝独秀。１９８０年安日产原油１３万桶，１９８４年增加到２０万桶，１９８７年底达到４０万桶。安的石油产量在撒哈拉以南非洲国家中仅次于尼日利亚，居第２位。除石油外，卡辛加的铁矿、北隆达的钻石和纳米贝的大理石也都久负盛名，正等待人们去开采。
    为了恢复濒于破产的经济，安哥拉政府在调整经济结构方面做了不懈的努力，并逐步将国民经济的重点从“一切为战争服务”转变到和平建设上来。提出在继续抓好石油生产的同时投资发展咖啡、钻石和木材生产等，争取实现出口产品多样化，并在总结经验教训的基础上，于１９８７年８月制订了“整顿经济和财政纲要”。
    新经济政策公开承认经济工作中的错误和偏差，强调要从历史和现实出发确认经济的地位和同西方发展经济贸易关系的必要性。新经济政策的宣布在一定意义上标志着安在发展方向上将力图摆脱僵化模式，积极探索适合本国国情的发展道路。无疑，这将对安今后的经济和政治形势产生深远的影响。
