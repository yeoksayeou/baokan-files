　　牙买加大选揭晓　曼利当选为总理
    新华社布里奇敦２月９日电  金斯敦消息：牙买加人民民族党主席迈克尔·曼利９日晚在大选中击败了现任总理、工党领袖爱德华·西加当选为新总理，任期５年。
    今年６５岁的曼利曾在１９７２年至１９８０年担任过牙买加总理。在这次大选中，他领导的人民民族党是牙买加最大的反对党。
    据报道，在２３０万人口的牙买加，约９０万人参加了大选。在已统计的６５％选票中，人民民族党在６０席的议会中赢得了３６席，而工党只取得了８席。西加当晚已承认失败。
    为保证自１９６２年牙买加独立以来第６次大选的顺利进行，牙买加当局出动了１００００名军警维持秩序。据报道，在最近３周的选举活动中，已有１１人死亡，约１００人受伤。
