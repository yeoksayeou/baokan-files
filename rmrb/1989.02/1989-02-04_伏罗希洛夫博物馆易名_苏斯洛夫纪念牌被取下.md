The Voroshilov Museum in Moscow has been renamed the Historical-Geographical Museum. The exhibits will be replaced and adjusted.

Voroshilov (1881-1969) was one of the founders and leaders of the Soviet Red Army, serving as the People's Commissar of Defense from 1925 to 1940, a member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the CPSU from 1926 to 1960, and the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR from 1953 to 1960.

According to Soviet media reports, Voroshilov bears responsibility for numerous wrongful cases that occurred in the Soviet Union during the 1930s, 1940s, and early 1950s.

After the renaming, the museum will retain only a few photographs related to Voroshilov's military activities and will exhibit items belonging to Soviet military leaders such as Voroshilov, Frunze, and Tukhachevsky.

A permanent memorial plaque dedicated to the former CPSU leader Suslov has been removed from a building at Moscow State University.

Suslov served as a member of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the CPSU from 1947, a member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the CPSU from 1955, and a member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the CPSU from 1966 until his death in January 1982.

After his death, the Central Committee of the CPSU and the Council of Ministers of the USSR decided to set up this memorial plaque as a permanent tribute to him.

Professor Sadovnichy, the first deputy rector of Moscow State University, said that the university's faculty and students are satisfied with this decision because Suslov made no practical contributions to the development of the university. He had only interned there and worked as an assistant for one year.

It is reported that the memorial plaques of Brezhnev and Chernenko have also been recently removed from the walls of certain buildings in Moscow.

　　伏罗希洛夫博物馆易名
　  苏斯洛夫纪念牌被取下
    新华社莫斯科２月２日电  据塔斯社今天报道，莫斯科的伏罗希洛夫博物馆被改名为历史地志博物馆。馆内展品将被更换和调整。
    伏罗希洛夫（１８８１—１９６９年）是苏联红军组建者和领导者之一，１９２５至１９４０年任苏联国防人民委员，１９２６至１９６０年任苏共中央政治局委员，１９５３至１９６０年任苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席。
    据苏联新闻媒介报道，伏罗希洛夫对苏联３０、４０年代和５０年代初发生的大量冤假错案负有责任。
    改名后的博物馆仅保留了与伏罗希洛夫军事活动有关的一些照片，并将展出伏龙芝和图哈切夫斯基等苏军将领的物品。
    新华社莫斯科２月２日电　据《消息报》今晚报道，用来纪念苏共前领导人苏斯洛夫的一块永久性纪念牌，已从莫斯科国立大学的一幢建筑物上取下。
    苏斯洛夫从１９４７年起任苏共中央书记，从１９５５年起任苏共中央主席团委员，从１９６６至１９８２年１月去世一直担任苏共中央政治局委员之职。
    在他去世后，苏共中央和苏联部长会议曾作出决定，设立此纪念牌以作为对他的永久性纪念。
    莫斯科大学第一副校长萨多夫尼奇教授说，莫斯科国立大学师生对此决定表示满意，因为苏斯洛夫未对该校的发展作出任何实际贡献。他只是曾在这里实习并当过一年助教而已。
    据悉，勃列日涅夫和契尔年科的纪念牌最近也从莫斯科某些建筑物的墙上取下。
