Due to a referee's error, the first World Cup swimming series competition today in London ended in farce. In the women's 400-meter freestyle final, athletes swam nine lengths in a 25-meter pool, swimming an extra 50 meters. The judges' committee issued a statement afterward, saying the mistake was due to the referee blowing the whistle only after the athletes had completed the full 400 meters. According to standard procedure, the "signal" should have been given when there were 50 meters remaining. As a result, Canadian athlete Vicki Varga, who finished first with a time of 4:13.46, did not relax and continued swimming for another 50 meters. The other athletes, not daring to slack off, followed suit, laboriously swimming an extra length.

The competition organizers ultimately decided that the results would be based on the automatic timing system's display at the 400-meter mark. Varga won the event. The gold medalist in the 200-meter freestyle at the Seoul Olympics, Friederike Wiebus of East Germany, finished in sixth place.

　　裁判疏忽大意　选手劳而无功
    世界杯游泳赛闹了个笑话
    据新华社伦敦２月２３日电  （记者李宗扬）由于裁判过失，第一届世界杯游泳系列赛今天在伦敦闹出笑话。在女子４００米自由泳决赛中，运动员在２５米长的泳池中游了９个来回，多游了整整５０米。裁判委员会在事后发表的声明中说，这一失误是由于裁判在运动员游完４００米的全程后才吹的哨。按常规这一“信号”应在还剩５０米时发出。结果，加拿大女选手沃兹布格在以４分１３秒４６率先到达终点后，毫无松懈，继续游了５０米，其他运动员也不敢怠慢，紧紧跟上，徒劳地游了一个来回。
    比赛组织者最后裁决，比赛结果以自动计分墙在４００米时显示的数字为准。沃兹布格获得这个项目的第一名。汉城奥运会２００米自由泳冠军、民主德国的弗里德里希仅列第６名。
