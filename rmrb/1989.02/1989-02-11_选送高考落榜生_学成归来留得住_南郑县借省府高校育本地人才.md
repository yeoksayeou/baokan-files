Nanchong County in the Qinba Mountains of Shaanxi Province has taken a unique approach to cultivating local talent in fields that are urgently needed and can be retained. Since last year, 194 high school dropouts have been studying at five universities in Xi'an. The county plans to cultivate 500 of its own university graduates within 3 to 5 years.

One of the key experiences in the county's rapid economic development is the crucial role played by science and technology and talent. Currently, there is an even greater need for various types of scientific and technological personnel to complement each other. However, relying solely on the state to allocate regular university students each year is like trying to fill a bucket with a teaspoon.

To address this, the county not only selects over a hundred people each year to take the adult college entrance examination and vocational school entrance examination but also, starting last year, established long-term cooperative relationships with seven universities, including Northwest University. On one hand, it attracts "fertile water" in science and technology to directly serve production and construction; on the other hand, it leverages the strong faculty resources of universities to cultivate its own talent.

Their method of entrusting universities to cultivate talent is as follows: each year, they set a cutoff score among the high school dropouts in the county, regardless of urban or rural household registration, using a voluntary application and selective admission process. They determine the number of students, the major, and the enterprise. The county signs a contract with the university to establish a special class for cultivation. Before the students enter the school, they sign a contract with the employing unit. After graduation, they work in that unit, and their treatment is the same as that of regular university students; if they leave the county, their academic qualifications are invalid. The tuition for sponsored education is covered 50% by the county's finances, 40% by the employing unit, and 10% by the student.

This approach effectively solves a series of problems, including sending students out, ensuring they study well, return, stay, and are well-placed.

　　选送高考落榜生　学成归来留得住   
    南郑县借省府高校育本地人才
    本报讯  地处秦巴山区的陕西省南郑县独辟蹊径，培养当地急需而又留得住的各类专业人才。从去年以来，已有１９４名高考落榜生在西安５所高等院校学习。县里决定，在３—５年内培养出５００名自己的大学生。
    该县经济迅猛发展的经验之一，是科技与人才起了举足轻重的作用。而眼下更加急需成龙配套的各种科技人才。但是，每年靠国家分配正规大学生，简直是杯水车薪。
    为此，县里除每年选送百余人报考成人大、中专外，从去年开始，与西北大学等７所高等院校建立了长期协作关系，一方面，吸引科技“肥水”，直接为生产建设服务；另一方面，借高校雄厚的师资，培养自己的人才。
    他们委托高校培养人才的方法是：每年在本县高考落榜生中，定出录取分数线，不分城镇和农村户口，采取自愿报名、择优录取的方法，定人，定专业，定企业。县里与大学定合同，开设专班进行培养。学生进校前就与用人单位签订合同，学习结业后，到该单位工作，其待遇与正规大学生等同；离开本县，则学历无效。代培学费由县财政出５０％，用人单位出４０％，本人出１０％。
    这种做法，较好地解决了学生送出去、学得好、回得来、留得住、好安排等一系列问题。
