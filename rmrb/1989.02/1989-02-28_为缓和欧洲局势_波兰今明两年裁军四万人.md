To ease European tensions, Poland will reduce its military by 40,000 troops over the next two years. This includes the retirement of approximately 850 tanks, 900 artillery pieces and mortars, 700 armored personnel carriers, 80 fighter jets, and other weapons.

Poland's Defense Minister, Czesław Kiszczak, announced this decision during an interview with Polish television. He stated that the reduction in personnel and the retirement of some weapons will be achieved through the disbandment and reorganization of units. Over the next two years, two mechanized divisions, two tank divisions, and several regiments from various branches will be disbanded or reorganized.

Within the Warsaw Pact, Poland's military ranks second only to the Soviet Union in terms of personnel and weaponry. In recent years, Polish leaders have emphasized the need for European countries to reduce their military forces and armaments to ease tensions. In May 1987, General Wojciech Jaruzelski proposed a "Comprehensive Plan for Disarmament and Increased Trust" to the nine Central European countries and began to reduce Poland's military and armaments. Over the past two years, Poland has already reduced its military by 15,000 troops and retired a large number of weapons and equipment.

The defense minister also mentioned that in early March, two tank regiments, one tactical missile brigade, and a motorized training regiment of the Polish military will be announced as disbanded.

　　为缓和欧洲局势
    波兰今明两年裁军四万人
    新华社华沙２月２６日电  （记者汤德乔）波兰国防部长西维茨基２６日宣布波兰军队在今明两年内将裁减４万名士兵，大约有８５０辆坦克、９００门火炮和迫击炮、７００辆装甲运输车、８０架战斗机及其他武器退役。
    西维茨基是在接受波兰电视台记者采访时宣布上述决定的。他说，裁减人员和使部分武器退役将通过解散和整编部队加以实现。今明两年内将解散两个机械化师，整编两个坦克师以及解散各兵种的十几个团。
    在华沙条约组织中，波兰部队人数和武器装备数量仅次于苏联，占第２位。近几年来，波兰领导人在讲话中强调欧洲各国要裁减部队和军备，以缓和欧洲局势。１９８７年５月，雅鲁泽尔斯基向中欧９国提出“裁军和增加信任的综合计划”，并开始率先压缩波兰军队，裁减军备。最近两年来波兰已裁军１．５万人，使大量武器和装备退役。
    这位国防部长还说，今年３月初波兰军队的两个坦克团、１个战役—战术火箭旅和汽车训练团等将宣布解散。
