Precious Trees Illegally Felled in Unprotected Nature Reserve

The Jinjiangtai Forest Farm in Shangcheng County of our province was approved as a provincial-level forest ecosystem nature reserve in 1982. The reserve is home to 190 species of mammals, birds, amphibians, and reptiles, as well as many precious trees. However, in the past two years, the number of illegal loggers in this nature reserve has been increasing.

So far, one-quarter of the forest area has been illegally felled. If management is not strengthened, the entire reserve will be destroyed within three to five years.

　　珍贵树被盗伐　保护区无保护
    我省商城金刚台林场１９８２年被批准为省级森林生态类型自然保护区。保护区内兽类、鸟类、两栖类、爬行类动物共１９０多种，还有不少珍贵树木。然而，近两年来，这个自然保护区内盗伐者日趋增多。
    到目前为止，已有１／４林区的树木被盗伐。若再不加强管理，不出三五年，整个保护区将被毁掉。
