The long-awaited Afghan Resistance Forces Consultative Council opened today at 4 PM in the Hajj camp on the outskirts of Rawalpindi. Approximately 400 representatives from Afghanistan, refugee camps, and Afghan exiles in Europe and the Americas attended the meeting.

The meeting began with the slogans "Long live Afghanistan!" and "Victory to the Holy War!" The seven leaders of the Afghan Resistance Forces Seven-Party Alliance sat on the stage, with Mujaddidi in the center and Nabī Muhammadī, chairman of the Islamic Revolutionary Movement, serving as the executive chairman of the conference. The consultative council was originally planned to have 519 seats, with 60 seats allocated to each of the seven parties, half of which are for guerrilla commanders fighting within Afghanistan. The Eight-Party Alliance was allocated 80 seats, with the remaining 19 seats reserved for "good Muslims" in the Kabul government. Due to disagreement with this distribution plan, representatives from the Eight-Party Alliance did not attend today's meeting.

It is reported that this consultative council will last for three days, with the primary goal of discussing the formation of a temporary government consisting of 28 members. The "Temporary Government of the Mujahideen," established last year, may be approved by the consultative council and further expanded and perfected. The council will also elect a temporary head of state and government.

Security was tight for this meeting, with armed resistance fighters guarding the gates of the Hajj camp and the conference hall. Over 300 Pakistani and foreign journalists rushed to cover the event, but were only allowed to stay for 10 minutes during the opening ceremony.

In the two days leading up to the conference, a clash occurred between supporters and opponents of former King Zahir Shah at a gathering of Afghan refugees in Peshawar, resulting in several injuries. Additionally, some refugee representatives do not recognize this consultative council. Three independent resistance factions have formed an alliance and oppose the convening of such a council.

　　阿富汗抵抗力量协商议会开幕   
    讨论组建临时政府问题　八党联盟代表没出席会议
    本报伊斯兰堡２月１０日电  记者任毓骏报道：筹备已久的阿富汗抵抗力量协商议会于今天下午４时在拉瓦尔品第近郊的朝觐营开幕，来自阿富汗境内、难民营、欧洲和美洲国家阿富汗流亡者的代表约４００人出席了会议。
    会议在“阿富汗万岁！”“圣战必胜”！的口号声中开幕。在会议主席台上就座的是阿富汗抵抗力量七党联盟的７名领导人，穆贾迪迪居中，会议执行主席是伊斯兰革命运动主席纳比·穆罕默迪。协商议会原定有５１９个席位，７党联盟每党６０个，其中一半是在阿富汗境内作战的游击队司令。八党联盟共有８０个，其余１９个留给喀布尔政府中“表现好的穆斯林”。由于八党联盟不同意这一分配方案，其代表没有出席今天的会议。
    据透露，这一协商议会为期３天，其目的是讨论产生一个由２８名成员组成的临时政府。去年成立的“圣战者临时政府”有可能获得协商议会的通过并进一步充实和完备。议会还将产生临时国家和政府首脑。
    这次会议戒备森严，荷枪实弹的抵抗战士守卫在朝觐营大门口和会议厅四周，３００多名巴基斯坦和外国记者赶来采访，但只允许在开幕式上停留１０分钟。
    这一议会召开的前两天，在白沙瓦的一次阿富汗难民集会上，前国王查希尔的拥护者和反对者发生了冲突，有数人受伤。另据报道，一些难民代表不承认这个协商议会。有３个独立的抵抗力量派别组成联盟，不同意召开这样的议会。
