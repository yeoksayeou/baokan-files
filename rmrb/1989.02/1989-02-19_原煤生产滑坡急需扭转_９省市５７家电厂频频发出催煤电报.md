	Coal production, which has traditionally promoted transportation, has recently seen a significant decline in output, leading to an unusual situation where railways are promoting production. According to statistics from 12 state-allocated coal mines in Shanxi, Henan, and Shaanxi provinces, 7 of these mines have seen a decrease in production. In January, these mines produced 430,000 tons less coal compared to the same period last year. Additionally, the effective coal reserves in these mines have decreased, causing the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau, which is responsible for coal transportation in this region, to transport 670,000 tons less coal compared to the same period last year. This has affected 57 power plants in 9 provinces and municipalities in Central China, East China, and South China, which have frequently sent urgent coal requests.

	In Henan, a major coal-producing province, the decline in coal production has resulted in only 680,000 tons of coal available for external transportation, which is far from the base figure of 1,550,000 tons required to ensure the state plan for external coal transportation. The shortage of coal for power generation has led to 500,000 to 600,000 kilowatts of generating units in Henan province being shut down awaiting coal. The power shortage has caused many enterprises to operate on a "three days on, four days off" or "four days on, three days off" schedule. Out of 110 fertilizer plants in Henan province, 97 have been forced to halt production, posing a serious threat to agricultural production.

	The main reasons for the decline in coal production are as follows: coal production is a loss-making industry. In recent years, many coal mines have had high output but low input, leading to equipment neglect, mining imbalances, and insufficient production momentum. Additionally, there is a shortage of personnel, as many contract workers in the mining areas, who rely on rationed grain, have left due to rising grain prices. Furthermore, coal mines are facing tight working capital, lacking the funds to purchase essential materials such as pit props, cement, and steel, which has also affected underground production.

	It is hoped that relevant departments will pay high attention to the severe situation of the coal production slump and ensure that coal production rebounds in the short term.

### 原煤生产滑坡急需扭转  ９省市５７家电厂频频发出催煤电报

　　原煤生产滑坡急需扭转    
    ９省市５７家电厂频频发出催煤电报
    编辑部：
    一向以产促运的煤炭生产，近来由于产量大幅度滑坡，出现了铁路以运促产的异常现象。据晋、豫、陕三省１２个统配煤矿的统计，有７个统配矿生产下降，元月份比去年同期少产原煤４３万吨，加上各矿有效存煤减少，担当这一区域煤炭运输的郑州铁路局，比去年同期少运６７万吨，由此波及华中、华东、华南电网的９省市５７家电厂频频发出催煤电报。
    产煤大省的河南，由于原煤产量下降，现在能集运外调的煤炭仅有６８万吨，这与保证国家计划外运１５５万吨煤炭的基数相差甚大。电煤紧缺，河南本省已有５０到６０万千瓦机组停机待煤；电力不足，造成许多企业每周生产“开三停四”或“开四停三”。河南省１１０个化肥厂，９７个成了无米之炊，给农业生产带来严重威胁。
    据了解，原煤产量下降的主要原因是，煤炭生产是亏损企业，近年许多煤矿的产出多，投入少，设备失修，采掘失调，生产后劲不足。再者是人员不足，矿区井下的协议工大都吃的议价粮，粮价上涨走失了许多劳动力。加上煤矿流动资金紧张，缺乏购进急需的坑木、水泥、钢材等，也影响了井下生产。
    希望有关方面高度重视原煤生产滑坡的严峻形势，确保原煤生产在短期内回升。
