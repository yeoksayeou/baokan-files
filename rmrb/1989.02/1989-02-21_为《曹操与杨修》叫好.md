Praising "Cao Cao and Yang Xu"

Huang Zongjiang

	This kind of praise, back in the day, must have been what the audiences at the Sanqing and Sijixi theaters shouted for the "Thirteen Absolutes of Tongguang"; now, there are successors. At the end of 1988, during the "Beijing Opera New Play Showcase," the old and young audiences from Tianjin also shouted like this, shouting from the heart.

	The traditional white-faced Cao Cao has a long history (the red-faced Cao Cao drawn by Guo Moruo, the red-and-white mixed Cao Cao drawn by Liang Xin, we won't discuss here). The novelist who compiled history and legends, Luo Guanzhong, the anonymous director of late Qing Beijing opera, Lu Shengkui, his successor, the late Xiao Changhua, and the generations of male lead actors such as Zhu Damazi, Huang San, Hao Shoushen, Hou Xirui, Qiu Shengqiong, and Yuan Shihai, all earned the title of "Living Cao Cao." It seemed that the legacy would end, but unexpectedly, it did not. In the late 1980s, Shang Changrong emerged. He used the singing, speaking, acting, and fighting of Beijing opera, and the character portrayal and psychological analysis that have been around since ancient times and have developed greatly in modern times, to create on stage such a cunning hero. The words "cunning hero" seem to be insufficient for the director of this play, but I cannot find a more appropriate phrase. This Cao Cao is indeed both heroic and cunning, both cunning and heroic, a portrait of countless great figures throughout history, but it does not allude to anyone. Why bother with allusions!

	Yang Xu was known as a scholar in ancient times and is now known as an intellectual. Although he appears infrequently in historical records, he is still a well-known figure. He has the common trait of scholars—he can "die for those who understand him" and "can be killed but not humiliated." He also has a traditional dependence, which is a tragedy for thousands of years, truly a great tragedy. The director of this play seems unwilling to measure it by Western tragic standards, and I cannot find an appropriate phrase. The actor Yang Xu also combines the essence of Beijing opera techniques, using modern psychological analysis to portray this typical ancient figure. Yang Xu's singing and speaking can blend the styles of his grandfather, Tan Xie, and his father, Yan Huisheng. I once suggested to him: performing old plays in the Yan style should be strictly Yan; performing new plays can borrow from various styles, making it new and innovative. This should be a matter of time, and it should happen soon. This Yang Xu is also well-crafted, with both form and spirit, but there is still much room for improvement. His intelligence is sufficient, but the flavor of a divine bag of tricks is not necessary, and it is especially inappropriate to have even a hint of a Taoist's smell. This kind of intellectual's playful disregard for the world often comes from extreme helplessness, actually being very respectful of the world, even overly respectful, and being played by others. On them, we should emphasize a sense of loyalty, that kind of foolish loyalty, which is actually not foolish, as it places all hopes on the lord they depend on, with a "heart-wrenching" concern for the country and the people. Such loyalty to the lord comes from loyalty to the country and the people; loyalty is difficult and hard to maintain, and this is an eternal tragedy.

	Beijing opera has developed to this day and is no longer the era of "the whole city listening to the singing of Tianyi" or the era of "Mei Cheng Shang Yuan" and "Tan Yu Yan Ma" centered on the development of schools. Today's audiences demand a higher level of comprehensiveness and integrity from performing arts than just "a single dish." The success of a play first lies in the "commander-in-chief" of the director. The success of this play also lies in the director Ma Ke's overall concept, which both utilizes the "alienation effect" and fully utilizes the "non-alienation effect." I apologize for coining a term, but I feel that some directors today seem to overemphasize "alienation" and neglect "non-alienation," while the latter is more important because the audience, although a mix of sensibility and rationality, is more inclined to intuition. Therefore, the director cannot overlook anything related to sight and hearing, striving to avoid "a little off, a thousand miles away," and striving to "a little more, a thousand miles gained." Under the director's overall concept, each part, the design of the singing, accompaniment, and percussion for the audience's hearing, and the design of the stage, lighting, and costumes for the audience's sight, all reach the pinnacle, with their independent beauty and contribution to the unified style. This comprehensive art must pursue the integrity that has been missing on the stage for a long time.

	I truly feel that it is a marvel to behold, without flaw! At this time, the creators should sincerely seek talents from all directions to find any flaws. I am not a talent, but last year when I first saw it in Tianjin, I tried to find a flaw. That is, in the scene of the ancestral hall, Cao Cao and Yang Xu, who are both very calculating, seem too calculating. Pretending makes it seem unreal. I suggest that "I have long suffered from the illness of dreaming of killing people" should start with Cao Cao's wife, Qianniang, covering for him, and then completely covering for her husband, even sacrificing herself. Later, her daughter also sacrifices herself for Yang Xu's wife. In this way, a play about emperors, generals, and internal and external killings shows the most beautiful spirit of self-sacrifice in women, which can shame men.

	When watching the play in Tianjin, I shouted, "This is a milestone!" and then couldn't help but laugh, fearing that it was too high and too early. No, don't mystify or glorify the milestone. It is like a historical ring with shallow and deep parts: in the 1950s, there was "Ye Zui Lin"; in the 1960s, there was "Yang's Female Generals" ... "Cao Cao and Yang Xu" will also bring back old audiences and attract new audiences for Beijing opera and its sister arts, which are called either "sunset art" or "the last supper."

### 为《曹操与杨修》叫好

　　为《曹操与杨修》叫好
    黄宗江
    这样叫好，当年在三庆、四喜台下为“同光十三绝”想必就是这样叫的；后继有人，一九八八岁末，在“京剧新剧目汇演”的台下，天津老少乡亲的观众们也是这样叫的，叫得出自肺腑。
    白脸曹操传统悠久（郭沫若所勾红脸的，梁信所勾红白相间的，此处不论）。集史书与传说大成的小说作者罗贯中，晚清京剧无名编导卢胜奎，其接班人已故肖长华，历代花脸演员朱大麻子、黄三、郝寿臣、侯喜瑞、裘盛戎，还有袁世海等，均获“活曹操”称号，看来要绝响矣，不竟而又不意外地在八十年代末，尚门长荣脱颖而出。他运用了京剧的唱念做打，运用了古代就有、现代大发展了的人物刻画与心理分析，在舞台上塑造了这样的一世奸雄。“奸雄”二字似乎此剧导演尚感到不足以概括之，但我找不出更合适的辞汇。此一曹公的确既雄且奸，既奸且雄，为古往今来多少伟大人物写照，却并未影射。何须影射！
    这杨修古称为士，今称知识分子。虽见诸经传不多，也算知名人士了。他有着士的共性——即可“为知己者死”，又“可杀而不可辱”，且有一种传统的“皮之不存，毛将焉附”的依附性，乃伤心千古，诚大悲剧也。此剧导演似又不愿以西方悲剧准则绳量之，我又找不出合适的辞汇了。言门兴朋，亦集京剧程式手段之大成，运用了现代的心理分析，刻画出此一典型的古代人物。兴朋唱念能融汇祖父的谭中有汪，父亲的言中有马。我曾向他建议：演言派老戏最好是严而又严的言而又言；演新戏则可篡取众家，新而又新，求创新言派。这当是后话，亦应在不久之后。此一杨修也创作得体，形神俱备，然亦大有推敲余地。智囊足矣，那种料事如神的锦囊味道却大可不必，尤不可沾上半点牛鼻子老道的味道。这种知识分子的玩世不恭，常出于极端无奈，实际是入世甚恭甚至过恭，乃被人家玩了。在他们身上反而要强调一个忠字，那种愚忠，实亦不愚，盖寄托了一切于其所依附主公的“念之断人肠”的忧国忧民。如此忠于主正出自忠于国忠于民；忠而难忠难终，这就是亘古悲剧了。
    京剧发展至今天，已经不是“满城听唱叫天儿”，不是以流派发展为中心的“梅程尚荀”、“谭余言马”的时代了；今天的观众要求于演出艺术的是更高于“一棵菜”的综合性与完整性了。一剧之成败首在于“三军统帅”般的导演。此剧的成功亦首在于导演马科的总体构思，既调动了“间离效果”，更充分运用了“无间效果”。恕我杜撰名辞，我感到今日有些导演似乎过分强调了“间离”，忽视了“无间”，而后者更为重要，因为观众虽然是感性与理性难以分割，但更多是诉诸直觉。因此，视、听上的一切，导演均不能轻轻放过，力避“差之毫厘，失之千里”，力求“争之毫厘，得之千里”。此剧在导演的总体构思下，各个分体，诉诸听觉的唱腔、配乐、打击乐的设计，与诉诸视觉的布景、灯光、服装造型设计，均臻上乘，既有其独立之美，更有所贡献于统一的风格。这种综合艺术必须追求的完整性是近日舞台久已夫不见的了。
    诚感到叹观止矣，无懈可击！此时此际，创作者倒要真诚地四方求贤，以求寻隙可击。愚下非贤，年前在津门初观，却曾试击一懈。即灵堂一场，曹操与杨修这两位的确各有心计的人又显得太有心计了。弄假反而失真。我建议“老夫夙患夜梦杀人之疾”开头就是曹夫人倩娘主动为曹掩过之谈，最后再为其夫大掩竟以身殉。其后其女又以身殉杨修夫业。这样一出帝王将相、内砍外杀的汉子们的戏，显示了此般女性中最美的献身精神，直可愧杀须眉也。
    在天津看戏时我冒叫了一声：“这就是里程碑！”又不禁失笑，惟恐失之于过高过早。不，也别把里程碑神秘化、伟大化，它亦如一种有浅有深的历史年轮：五十年代有《野猪林》，六十年代有《杨门女将》……《曹操与杨修》也将为或称“夕阳艺术”或称“最后晚餐”的京剧及其姊妹唤回老观众，召来新观众……
