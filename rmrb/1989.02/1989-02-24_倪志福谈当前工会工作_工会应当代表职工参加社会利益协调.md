In economic conflicts, trade unions should uphold workers' legal rights

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 23 (Reporters Huang Xiao Nan, Xu Ke Hong) Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Nie Zhifu, emphasized today that when conflicts arise between managers and workers in enterprises, trade unions should firmly support workers' reasonable demands and actively do mediation work; otherwise, trade unions cannot represent workers.

Currently, various contradictions and problems in China's economic sphere are numerous. Due to the implementation of rational labor organization, the reduction of construction scale, and the increase in loss-making enterprises, unemployment and reemployment issues will become prominent problems. Some places have problems in policies or incomplete and inadequate work, as well as insufficient propaganda and explanation, which often lead to contradictions and conflicts. Nie Zhifu said at the second meeting of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions Chairman's Council that the situation requires trade unions to better participate in the coordination of social interests, participate in legislation and the formulation of major policies, and safeguard workers' legal rights.

Regarding the practice of some places and enterprises ignoring workers' legal rights and even placing workers in an opposing position, taking inappropriate measures to handle contradictions, Nie Zhifu said, "Such behavior is unacceptable; it will only exacerbate conflicts."

Nie Zhifu urged local trade unions to do more mediation and reconciliation work, and to resolve contradictions at the grassroots level and in their early stages as much as possible.

After the conclusion of the 11th National Congress of the Chinese Trade Union in October last year, the newly elected leaders of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions immediately went to various places to conduct in-depth investigations and research on trade union development issues. In the future, trade unions will invest more effort in protecting the legal rights of the masses of workers and strengthening the construction of grassroots trade unions.

　　倪志福谈当前工会工作
    工会应当代表职工参加社会利益协调
    在经济利益冲突中应维护职工合法权益
    新华社北京２月２３日电　（记者黄晓南、徐克洪）中华全国总工会主席倪志福今天强调指出，在企业中经营者与职工发生矛盾时，工会应坚决支持职工的合理要求，积极做好疏导工作，否则工会就不能成为职工的代表。
    当前，我国经济领域中各类矛盾和问题较多。由于推行劳动组织合理化、压缩基建规模和亏损企业增多，职工待业和就业问题将成为突出问题；一些地方在政策上存在的问题或工作不周到、不完善以及宣传解释不够，也常常引起矛盾和冲突。倪志福就此在全总主席团二次会议上说，形势要求工会更好地参与社会利益的协调，参与立法和重大政策的制订，维护职工的合法权益。
    针对个别地方和企业在处理矛盾时无视职工群众的合法权益，甚至把职工置于对立面，采取不适当措施的做法，倪志福表示，“这种行为是不可取的，这样做只会激化矛盾。”
    倪志福要求各地工会多做疏导和调解工作，尽可能把矛盾解决在基层，解决在萌芽状态。
    去年１０月中国工会第１１次全国代表大会结束以后，新当选的全总领导成员立即分赴各地，深入调查研究工会发展问题。今后，工会将在切实维护职工群众合法权益，加强基层工会建设方面投入更多的精力。
