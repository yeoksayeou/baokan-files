Israeli Minister of Religion Hammer said at a press conference held in Budapest on the 15th that he had made a "very successful" visit to Hungary.

Hammer arrived in Hungary on the 11th. He is the first Israeli minister to officially visit this country. Some high-ranking Israeli officials who had recently visited Hungary were all on private visits.

Hammer said he brought a letter from Israeli Prime Minister Shamir to Hungarian Prime Minister Nemeth. However, he refused to disclose the contents of the letter, only saying that he hoped that diplomatic relations between the two countries could be restored in the first half of this year, and expressed the hope that Prime Minister Nemeth could visit Israel as soon as possible.
