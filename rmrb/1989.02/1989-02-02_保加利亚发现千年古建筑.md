Bulgarian archaeologists recently discovered a wooden structure, a long corridor-type building, buried underground at the ancient capital site of Pliska in Bulgaria.

According to reports, research has confirmed that this ancient building was part of the Bulgarian royal court in the 9th century AD, dating back over 1,000 years. Archaeologists speculate that in 971 AD, the Byzantine army conquered the Bulgarian kingdom and burned down the city of Pliska, destroying the wooden corridor at that time, which was later buried underground.

According to reports, the discovery of this ancient building was an unexpected result of aerial photography. The shape and location of the building can be seen in the photographs. Based on the clues provided by the photographs, archaeologists conducted excavations and found that part of the outer wall of the corridor was well-preserved. The doors and entrances of the corridor were still vaguely discernible, and the stone pavement on the ground was flat and solid.

　　保加利亚发现千年古建筑
    新华社索非亚１月３１日电  保加利亚考古学家最近在保加利亚普里斯卡的古都遗址发现了一所被埋在地下的木结构长廊式建筑物。
    据报道，经研究证实，这一古建筑大约是公元９世纪保加利亚王朝的宫廷的一部分，距今已有１０００多年。考古学家推断，公元９７１年，拜占廷军队征服保加利亚王国，放火烧毁了普里斯卡城，这一木结构长廊当时被烧毁，以后被埋在地下。
    据报道，这一古建筑的发现是航空摄影的意外收获。从照片上能看得出建筑物的外形和位置。根据照片提供的线索，考古学家们进行了挖掘，发现一部分长廊的外墙保存完好，长廊的门和出入口还依稀可辨，地面铺的石砖平整坚实。
