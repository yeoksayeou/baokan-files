If South Africa adheres to the Angola peace and Namibian independence agreements, Kaunda is willing to meet with the South African president.

Xinhua News Agency, Lusaka, February 8th - Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda stated on the 7th that he is willing to meet with South African President P.W. Botha under certain conditions.

Kaunda made these remarks to reporters accompanying Italian President Francesco Cossiga during his visit. He said that if South African President P.W. Botha adheres to the three-party agreement signed in December 1988 by Angola, Cuba, and South Africa regarding peace in Angola and independence for Namibia, he would be willing to meet with Botha.

He recalled that in 1984, South Africa had signed an agreement with Angola regarding the withdrawal of South African troops from Angola, and a pact with Mozambique not to support each other's anti-government forces. However, these agreements and pacts were not honored.

According to the three-party agreement, starting from April 1st of this year, the implementation of the United Nations Security Council's Resolution 435 on Namibian independence will begin. By November 1st, South African troops will have completely withdrawn from Namibia. Therefore, Kaunda said, as the chairman of the frontline states, he could only meet with Botha after the United Nations Security Council's resolution is implemented.

Kaunda also mentioned that he had suggested to Botha to recall African National Congress (ANC) President Oliver Tambo, release black leader Nelson Mandela, lift the ban on the anti-apartheid movement African National Congress, and begin dialogue with African leaders.

Kaunda once again urged the United States to stop supporting the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) in order to achieve complete independence for Angola.

　　如果南非遵守安哥拉和平和纳米比亚独立协议
　  卡翁达愿意会晤南非总统
    新华社卢萨卡２月８日电  赞比亚总统卡翁达７日在这里表示，他愿意有条件地会晤南非总统博塔。
    卡翁达总统７日晚对来访的意大利总统科西加的随行记者发表谈话说，如果南非总统博塔遵守安哥拉、古巴和南非１９８８年１２月签署的关于安哥拉和平和纳米比亚独立的三方协议，那么他将愿意会晤博塔。
    他回顾说，１９８４年，南非同安哥拉签署过关于南非军队撤出安哥拉的协议，同莫桑比克签署过互不支持对方的反政府武装的条约，但是协议和条约没有得到遵守。
    按照三方协议，今年４月１日起开始执行联合国安理会关于纳米比亚独立的４３５号决议，１１月１日前，南非军队全部撤出纳米比亚。因此，卡翁达总统说，作为前线国家主席，他同博塔的会晤只能在联合国安理会的决议得到实施以后。
    卡翁达还说，他已建议博塔请回非洲人国民大会主席坦博，释放黑人领袖曼德拉，取消对反种族隔离运动非洲人国民大会的禁令并开始同非洲领导人对话。
    卡翁达再次呼吁美国停止支持安哥拉反政府武装争取安哥拉彻底独立全国联盟（安盟）。
