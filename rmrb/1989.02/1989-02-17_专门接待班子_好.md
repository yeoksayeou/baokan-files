The Special Reception Team is Good

From the radio, I heard that a certain place has reformed its reception methods by establishing a special reception team to handle the reception of various official personnel coming to the area for visits, inspections, and work coordination. It is said that since the establishment of this team, local party and government leaders have been freed from the previously tedious reception work, while the various officials being received are also satisfied with the dedicated reception. It is truly a perfect outcome.

I cannot say whether this practice began from the nationwide large-scale organization of visits to Dazhai (which was privately referred to as "pilgrimage" at the time) or if it is a remnant of that tradition. In any case, in recent years, it has become common to mobilize large numbers of people, with a certain responsible official in charge, to visit, tour, learn from, seek advice from, and inspect other places (excluding sightseeing and tourism). This has almost become a trend. Especially for pilot or advanced units, or even just units reported in newspapers, on television, or on the radio, and located in tourist areas, these places are the hotspots hit by this trend. These visitors go there and insist on being received by officials of the same or higher rank, even if they are of lower rank, disturbing the local leaders and consuming a large amount of time, energy, and financial resources. Now, this is good; the leaders are freed.

Now, with the endless "sea of meetings," many leaders are also tired of it. They can learn from this and establish a special team for attending and participating in various meetings. In this way, even if the "sea of meetings" is vast, the leaders can be freed from many meetings that have little or no value.

Moreover, if every province, city, and autonomous region, down to the county level, across the country, learn from this reform experience and establish special reception teams, not only can new institutions be created and a large number of people be employed, but the already prevalent practices of visits, inspections, and the "sea of meetings" will also become even more prosperous. First, the place that created this reform experience will once again become a hotspot for visits and inspections.

### “专门接待班子”好

　　“专门接待班子”好
    从广播中听到，某地改革接待办法，成立了一个专门的接待班子，负责接待来当地参观、考察和联系工作的各类官方人员。据说，该班子成立后，当地党政负责同志从过去那种不胜其烦的接待工作中解脱了出来，而各类被接待人员因有专人接待也很满意。真是功德圆满。
    这是否是从当年全国大规模组织参观大寨（当时私下称其为“朝圣”）时开始形成的，或者是这种参观的遗风，我说不上；总之，这些年，动不动兴师动众，由某负责官员挂帅，浩浩荡荡，到外地参观、访问、学习、取经、考察，（且把游山玩水除外），简直成了一股风。特别是一些试点或先进单位，或者只是在报纸上、电视里、广播中报道过的单位且又在旅游胜地的，更是这股风冲击的热点。这些参观考察者去了，又讲究什么级别由什么级别的接待，甚至低级别的也要由高级别的接待，打搅得当地领导不得安宁，花费了大量时间、精力和财力。这下好了，领导解脱了。
    现在“会海”无边，许多领导不胜其烦，也可仿效成立一个专门开会的班子，负责参加和出席各类会议。这样，“会海”再大也无妨，领导却可从许多毫无价值和价值不大的会议中解脱出来。
    而且，如果全国各省市自治区以至到县都学习这一改革经验，纷纷成立专门的接待班子，不但又可以增加一批新机构，安排大批人就业，而且已经成风的参观考察、文山会海也会更加兴旺发达。首先，创造这一改革经验的某地又将成为参观考察的热点了。
