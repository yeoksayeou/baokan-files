The Suzhou education system in Jiangsu Province has vigorously developed school-run enterprises, using the income from these enterprises to improve school conditions and raise teachers' salaries.

Suzhou is an economically developed region. Although the city increases its investment every year, with 40% of local financial resources allocated to education, there is still a significant funding gap. Facing this situation, education department officials realized that relying solely on state "blood transfusions" is no longer feasible. To develop education, they must strengthen their own "blood-making" function by running enterprises and generating revenue. Over the past few years, Suzhou's school-run industries have gradually developed. By the end of last year, there were 1,518 school-run enterprises in primary and secondary schools, employing 24,000 workers, covering more than 10 industries, and producing nearly 1,000 different products. In 1988, the total output value of all school-run enterprises in the city was 447 million yuan, with a profit of 62.7 million yuan.

School-run enterprises provide a steady stream of revenue. In the past three years, Suzhou's primary and secondary schools have, in addition to paying 37.83 million yuan in state taxes, provided schools with 48.71 million yuan for education and teachers' welfare. Among these, the revenue from school-run enterprises in the urban area is equivalent to one-quarter of the government's budgetary allocations. The revenue from school-run enterprises, along with state allocations and social fundraising, has become one of the three main sources of funding for compulsory education. No. 38 Middle School was originally poorly equipped and had weak teaching staff, making it one of the worst schools in the urban area. In recent years, the profits from the school's enterprises have increased year by year, providing the school with 8.4 million yuan over three years. Now, the school has renovated its buildings, built language labs and experiment rooms, and added audio-visual equipment. The improvement in school conditions has promoted the quality of teaching. Last year, the school's junior high school graduation rate reached 98.4%.

    校办企业成为苏州普教一大财源
    本报讯  江苏省苏州教育系统大力发展校办企业，依靠这部分收入改善办学条件，提高教师待遇。
    苏州是经济发达地区，尽管市里年年增加投入，地方财力的４０％用于教育，但经费仍有很大缺口。面对这一形势，教育部门的同志认识到，单靠国家“输血”已不行，要发展教育，就得健全自己的“造血”功能，办企业，搞创收。几年来，苏州市的校办工业逐步发展。到去年为止，中小学校办企业已达１５１８家，职工２．４万人，形成１０多个行业，生产近千种产品。１９８８年，全市校办企业完成产值４．４７亿元，实现利润６２７０万元。
    校办企业提供了源源不断的财源。近三年来，苏州市中小学除上交国家税收３７８３万元外，向学校提供了用于办学和教师福利的资金４８７１万元。其中，市区校办企业提供的资金，相当于政府预算内拨款的１／４。校办企业的资金与国家拨款、社会集资并列，成为普教经费的三个来源之一。３８中原来设备简陋，师资薄弱，是市区最差学校中的一个。近年来，该校校办企业的利润年年增长，三年为学校提供了８４万元资金。现在，学校翻新了校舍，建了语音室、实验室，添了电教设备。办学条件的改善，促进了教学质量的提高。去年，该校的初中毕业率达９８．４％。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（吴纪康）
