A recently compiled report indicates that over the past decade, 30% of the economic growth in Beijing's rural areas has been achieved through technological advancements. This has resulted in an accumulated increase of 6.3 billion yuan in farmers' income.

According to incomplete statistics, from 1986 to 1988, Beijing's suburban areas promoted over 4,000 technological achievements. Nearly 30,000 technical personnel have been actively working in the countryside, facilitating the application of these technological advancements.

Beijing has numerous scientific research institutions and universities, which produce a large number of research achievements annually. The suburban areas of Beijing serve as an ideal location for the promotion of these technologies. To this end, Beijing has implemented various measures to provide tax and loan incentives for the application of new technologies, thereby promoting the dissemination of technological achievements. Last year alone, the Beijing Academy of Agricultural Sciences promoted 24 technological achievements in the suburban areas, generating an economic benefit of 200 million yuan.

To promote the application of technological achievements in township enterprises, Beijing has relaxed policies to encourage and support technical personnel in assisting township enterprises. Currently, over 20,000 technical personnel are working in various capacities for township enterprises, with 80% serving as factory directors or chief engineers. Additionally, 3,500 individuals have been officially transferred to township enterprises. Statistics show that in just three years, the 701 "Torch Program" projects in Beijing's suburban areas, aimed at revitalizing the rural economy, have introduced and promoted 2,000 technological achievements, developed 353 new products, and generated a profit of 100 million yuan.

　　京郊经济增长三成靠科技
    据新华社北京２月１２日电（记者苏会志）一份新汇总的材料表明：北京市农村经济近１０年的增长部分中有３０％是靠科技进步取得的，农民因此增加的收入累计达６３亿元。
    据不完全统计，１９８６年至１９８８年，京郊共推广科技成果４０００多项，近３００００名科技人员长年活跃在乡村，促进了科技成果的推广应用。
    北京科研机构、大专院校多，每年都推出大批科研成果，而京郊则是最好的推广场所。为此，北京市采取了多种措施对新技术的应用在税收、贷款方面给予一定的优惠，借以促进科技成果的推广。去年，仅北京农科院就在京郊推广了２４项科技成果，创经济效益２亿元。
    为促进科技成果在乡镇企业的推广应用，北京市还放宽政策，鼓励和支持科技人员支援乡镇企业。现在全市已有２万余名科技人员以多种形式为乡镇企业工作，其中８０％担任了厂长或总工程师，并有３５００人正式调入乡镇企业。据统计，短短３年，京郊乡镇企业以振兴农村经济为宗旨的７０１个“星火计划”项目，先后引进推广２０００项科技成果，开发新产品３５３个，获利１亿元。
