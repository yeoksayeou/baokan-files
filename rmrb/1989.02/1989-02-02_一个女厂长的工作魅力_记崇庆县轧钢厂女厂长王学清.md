A female director leading a steel enterprise seems far from traditional notions. Once, Wang Xueqing attended a metallurgical industry experience exchange meeting in Sichuan. Among the rows of male directors and managers, a woman in a tweed coat suddenly appeared, drawing special attention. A colleague joked with her, “Director Wang, this metallurgical industry is a traditional domain of men. How did you, a ‘half of the sky,’ manage to squeeze in?”

In 1972, Wang Xueqing was barely over 20 years old when she led a group of road construction workers to screen sand and gravel on the riverbank. The road was completed, and the sand and gravel team was about to disband. At this time, Wang Xueqing learned that the market was short of small steel building materials, and the construction industry would definitely see a big development. Thus, she dared to think and act boldly, deciding to select 24 people from the workers, use an 84-square-meter dilapidated house as the factory, and use the remaining few ten thousand yuan from screening sand and gravel as capital to establish a rolling steel factory.

Her idea was not understood by her superiors, and some people mocked her.

“A rolling steel factory is not a small iron furnace for making sickles. How can a woman run a rolling steel factory?”

The stubborn Wang Xueqing would not take this lying down. She persuaded her superiors, first went to the county steel plant for help, and then went to Chongqing five times to hire rolling steel technicians. At the Third Steel Plant in Chongqing, Wang Xueqing noticed a retired rolling steel worker named Zhong. Wang Xueqing spoke to him repeatedly, finally convincing Mr. Zhong. Unexpectedly, Mr. Zhong's wife and daughter were not at ease with him going far away, and came out to “intervene.” Wang Xueqing stayed in the hotel and did not leave, going to Mr. Zhong's house every day under the scorching sun, helping the elderly with housework, and chatting with them. When hungry, she would run to the street to eat a bowl of noodles to get by.

“Sincerity can move even stones.” The old lady finally said to Wang Xueqing, “Good daughter, I agree with you. This time I will definitely let him go with you, and he won't come back until he rolls out steel.”

Wang Xueqing thus hired several talents. From then on, the furnaces of Chongqing County Rolling Steel Factory burned brighter and brighter, and the factory became more and more prosperous.

Wang Xueqing is a stubborn female talent in her career, but in life, she has a kind and friendly face and a “motherly heart.” The workers in the factory do not call her “Director Wang,” but affectionately call her “Queen Wang.” Young people have something on their minds and are willing to talk to her, encounter something, and want to consult her, even finding girlfriends, they also ask Wang Xueqing for advice.

The workers of Chongqing County Rolling Steel Factory are mostly urban residents or farmers who have just put down their hoes, and one-third are delinquent youth allocated from the streets. Many people have low education, poor quality, do not understand technology, and some are very difficult to tame “wild horses.” However, Wang Xueqing believes that these people are young, smart, and highly malleable, both bendable and straightenable, the key is education. She smelts steel and people, inviting retired teachers to give legal, cultural, and technical courses to young workers, improving their cultural literacy. At the same time, she often has heart-to-heart talks with young workers, helping them solve practical problems. Through patient cultivation and education, many young workers, including many delinquent youth, have become the backbone of the factory.

Liu Anxiang, formerly a notorious “daredevil” on the streets, was untamable. After coming to the rolling steel factory, the factory established a help and education group for him, often talking to him about ideals and prospects. Later, his mother passed away, and Director Wang mobilized the workers to donate, and the factory also lent him a sum of money to handle the funeral. The care of the workers and the factory warmed Liu Anxiang's heart, and from then on, he continuously strove for progress, becoming a production backbone, and was evaluated as an advanced worker every year.

“Queen Wang, help me out, I will never forget you for the rest of my life.” Young worker Peng Yinghong pleaded. It turned out that he had found a girlfriend, and the two were very compatible, but unfortunately, the girl's parents strongly opposed it. Director Wang visited the girl's parents several times, persuading them not to arrange their children's marriages. Under Director Wang's patient mediation, Peng Yinghong finally got married happily. Now, he gets along very well with his father-in-law and his family. Peng Yinghong works hard in production and performs excellently.

With such a harmonious team of workers and management, how can production not go well? How can product quality not be improved? This year, Chongqing County Rolling Steel Factory is even more prosperous. The round nails and black iron wire produced by the factory will be exported 1,500 tons, going to the international market.

　　一个女厂长的工作魅力
    ——记崇庆县轧钢厂女厂长王学清
    本报记者  罗茂城
    女同志当钢铁企业的厂长，似乎与人们的传统观念相去太远。有一次，王学清参加四川冶金行业经验交流会，在清一色的男厂长经理行列里，突然闪出一位穿花呢大衣的女同志，特别引人注目。同行对她打趣道：“王厂长，这冶金行业是我们男人占据的传统领地，你这‘半边天’怎么也挤进来了？！”
  （一）
    １９７２年，王学清才２０多岁，就带领一批筑路民工在河滩筛沙石。公路修好了，沙石队要散伙。这时王学清了解到市场上建筑小钢材很缺，将来建筑行业一定是大发展的趋势，于是她敢想敢干，决定从民工中抽出２４人，以８４平方米的破房子作厂房，利用筛沙石结余的几万元作资本，筹建轧钢厂。
    她的想法领导不理解，有的人在讥笑。
    “轧钢厂又不是打镰刀的小铁炉，一个女子，办什么轧钢厂啊！”
    倔强的王学清不服这口气。她说服领导，先到达县钢铁厂求援，后又五下重庆市聘请轧钢技术人员。在重庆第三钢铁厂，王学清看中了该厂一位姓钟的退休轧钢工。王学清左说右说，总算把钟师傅说通了，没想到钟师傅的老伴和女儿不放心他一人出远门，出来“挡架”。王学清住在旅馆里不走了，每天冒着似火骄阳到钟师傅家里，一边帮老人扫地提水、理菜洗衣，一边同他们聊家常。饿了，她跑到街上随便吃碗面应付了事。
    “精诚所至，金石为开。”老妈妈终于对王学清说：“好女儿，我答应你，这次我一定让他跟你去，不轧出钢材不回来！”
    王学清就这样，先后聘请了好几位人才。从此，崇庆县轧钢厂的炉火越烧越红火，工厂越办越兴旺。
  （二）
    王学清在事业上是一位倔强的女能人，而在生活上却有一副和蔼可亲的面孔和一颗“婆婆心”。厂里职工不叫她“王厂长”，而是亲昵地喊她“王娘娘”。青年人心中有什么话，愿意对她讲，遇到什么事，要找她商量，就是找女朋友，也要请王学清参谋参谋。
    崇庆县轧钢厂的工人大多是城镇居民或刚放下锄把的农民，而且有１／３是从街道分配来的失足青年。许多人文化低，素质差，不懂技术，有的还是很难驯服的“野马”。但是，王学清认为这些人年轻、聪明，可塑性很强，既能扭弯，也能扳直，关键在教育。她炼钢又炼人，请来退休教师给青工上法制课、文化课和技术课，提高他们的文化修养。与此同时，她还经常同青工促膝谈心，帮他们解决实际问题。通过耐心的培养、教育，许多青工、包括不少失足青年，都成了工厂的骨干。
    刘安祥，过去他是街上有名的“敢死队员”，没人管得住他。小刘来轧钢厂以后，厂里为他成立了帮教小组，经常同他讲理想、前途。后来他母亲去世了，王厂长动员职工捐助，厂里又借给他一笔钱办理丧事。职工和厂里的关怀，温暖了刘安祥的心，从此，他不断要求上进，成为生产骨干，年年被评为先进工作者。
    “王娘娘，帮个忙，我一辈子都忘不了你。”青工彭应洪恳求道。原来，他找到一位女友，两人情投意合，但不料女方父母坚决反对。王厂长多次找到女方父母，劝他们不要包办儿女婚事。在王厂长的耐心调解下，彭应洪终于幸福地结了婚。现在，他和岳父一家人相处很好。彭应洪生产卖力，干得很出色。
    有这样一支干群融洽的队伍，何愁生产搞不上去呢？何愁产品质量提不上去呢？今年，崇庆县轧钢厂更是锦上添花，该厂生产的圆钉和黑铁丝，将出口１５００吨，销往国际市场。
