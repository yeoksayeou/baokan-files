The Soviet government is strengthening price supervision to prevent unreasonable price hikes, consumer deception, and excessive profit-taking.

	The Soviet government has issued a decision to eliminate flaws in price-setting work, as reported by TASS today.

	In recent times, Soviet enterprises have implemented comprehensive economic accounting and self-financing, which has expanded their authority in setting prices. Some enterprises have taken advantage of this to raise product prices, leading to a significant reduction in the production of low-profit daily necessities and children's goods. Various cooperatives have also raised prices for goods and services, with some even buying scarce items from state-owned stores and reselling them at higher prices to consumers.

	The Soviet government has decided that state orders for low-profit products are mandatory for light industrial enterprises. It is forbidden to raise prices for consumer goods with minimal performance changes. It is also prohibited to set excessively high negotiated or temporary prices for children's and elderly goods. Temporary price increases for new and fashionable products should not exceed 50%.

	Regarding the special circumstances of cooperatives, the Council of Ministers has authorized local governments to set maximum price increases for cooperative restaurants and to oversee food quality. The financial records of cooperatives must be strictly maintained, and failure to do so will result in liability under the Soviet cooperative law.

　　苏联加强物价监督
　　不允许乱涨价、欺骗顾客和牟取暴利
    新华社莫斯科２月３日电  苏联政府为加强物价监督工作，不允许不合理地涨价、欺骗顾客和牟取高额利润。
    塔斯社今天发表了苏联部长会议关于消除制定价格工作中的缺点的决定。
    最近一个时期以来，苏联的企业实行了全面经济核算和自负盈亏，它们在制定价格方面的权利扩大了，一些企业趁机提高了产品价格，利润低的日用品和儿童商品的产量大大减少。各种合作社也纷纷提高商品和服务项目的价格，甚至出现了从国营商店购买紧俏商品加价出售给顾客的现象。
    苏联政府决定：国家对低利润产品的订货是轻工业企业的硬性任务；禁止对消费性能变化不大的商品提高价格；禁止对儿童和老年人用品制定过高的议价和临时价格；对新产品和时髦产品的临时加价不得超过５０％。
    针对合作社的特殊情况，苏联部长会议委托地方政府为合作餐馆制定最高加价，并且监督其食品质量，合作社收支情况要严格登记，否则将承担苏联合作社法规定的责任。
