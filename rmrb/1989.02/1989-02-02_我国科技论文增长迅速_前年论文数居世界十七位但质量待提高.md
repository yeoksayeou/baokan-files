	China's Scientific and Technological Papers Growing Rapidly, but Quality Needs Improvement

	Our reporter, Chen Zujia, reports: A statistical report indicates that the proportion of scientific and technological academic papers published in China is relatively small in the world's total, but the growth rate is high. The number of papers in 1987 ranked 17th in the world.

	Researchers from the Chinese Academy of Science and Technology Information Institute used bibliometric methods to count the number of Chinese papers selected by the four retrieval systems of the American "Science Citation Index" (SCI), "Index to Scientific and Technical Proceedings" (ISTP), "Engineering Index" (EI), and "Science Review Index" (ISR). They drew the above conclusions.

	Researchers believe that the status of scientific and technological papers is an important indicator of a country's scientific and technological output, especially in basic research. The four major retrieval systems in the United States, although not reflecting the entire situation of papers published in China, have collected most of the important scientific and technological journals and important scientific documents from international conferences worldwide. Evaluating China's scientific and technological level based on this has a certain scientific basis and reference value.

	Statistics show that these four retrieval systems collected a total of 900,942 scientific and technological academic papers worldwide in 1987, of which 9,017 were from China, accounting for less than 1%. This figure is obviously disproportionate to China's status and scientific potential. However, the growth rate of Chinese papers is relatively high. According to the "Science Citation Index," which collects part or all of the articles from 3,300 important scientific and technological journals worldwide, the growth rate of papers in 1986 compared to 1985 was 0.8% globally, while China's growth was 26%. In 1987, when the global paper count slightly decreased compared to 1986, China's papers still increased by 12.2%. In this retrieval system, China's papers have risen from the 26th position in the world in 1985 to the 24th in 1987.

	Although the proportion of academic papers from China in the international arena is relatively small, the proportion of engineering and technical papers is not insignificant. According to the "Engineering Index," in 1987, 2,278 papers from China were included, accounting for 2.27% of the world's total, ranking among the top 10 in the world. However, the number of papers included in the agricultural field is relatively small, with only 79 papers in 1987, accounting for 1.2% of the papers included from China. This indicates that agricultural research is a weak link in China.

	The reform and opening-up policy has opened effective channels for China to understand the latest dynamics and information in international frontier disciplines. The opportunities for scientific and technological personnel to participate in international conferences have increased, and the number of papers published annually has also increased. According to the "Index to Scientific and Technical Proceedings," which collects reports on 80-90% of important scientific and technological conferences worldwide, in 1987, Chinese scientific and technological workers published 1,774 papers at important international conferences, more than double the number in 1985. The number of papers has surpassed India and Brazil, reaching the 14th position in the world.

	Researchers believe that the journals and papers selected by the index have strict standards, while the adoption rate of Chinese scientific and technological journals and papers is relatively low, indicating that the quality of Chinese academic journals and the level of papers need to be improved. China has exported 200 kinds of scientific and technological journals, all of which have English versions or English abstracts, but only 11 have been selected by the "Science Citation Index," while Japan has 71 scientific and technological journals selected. Similarly, for 11 selections, China has only 1,159 papers selected, while India has 2,111 papers selected. Brazil, with only 3 journals, has 995 papers selected.

　　我国科技论文增长迅速
    前年论文数居世界十七位但质量待提高
    本报讯  记者陈祖甲报道：一份统计报告说，我国发表的科学技术学术论文在世界论文总数中占的比重较小，但增长率高。１９８７年的论文数处于世界前１７位。
    中国科技情报所的研究人员采用情报学文献计量方法，统计美国的《科学引文索引》（ＳＣＩ）、《科学评论索引》（ＩＳＲ）、《科学技术会议录索引》（ＩＳＴＰ）以及《工程索引》（ＥＩ）４个检索系统选录我国论文的数量，得出了上述结论。
    研究人员认为，科技论文的状况是衡量一个国家科学技术、尤其是基础研究产出的一个重要指标。美国４大检索系统所反映的虽不是我国发表论文的全部状况，但它们收集了世界上绝大部分重要科技期刊、国际会议的重要科学文献。依此对我国科学技术水平进行评估，有一定的科学性和参考价值。
    统计表明，这４个检索系统共收集１９８７年世界科学技术学术论文多达９０．０９４２万篇，其中我国的论文为９０１７篇，不足１％。这个数字显然与我国的地位和科学的潜力不相称。但是，我国论文的增长率比较高。据收集世界上３３００种重要科技期刊发表的部分或全部文章的《科学引文索引》统计，１９８６年与１９８５年比，世界论文增长率为０．８％，我国则增长２６％；而在１９８７年世界论文比１９８６年略有下降的情况下，我国论文仍然增长１２．２％。在这个检索系统中，我国论文已由１９８５年的世界２６位上升到１９８７年的２４位。
    尽管我国学术论文在国际上所占的比例比较小，但工程技术方面的论文所占比例却不小。按《工程索引》统计，１９８７年，我国被收录的论文达２２７８篇，占世界总数的２．２７％，进入世界前１０名。但在农业方面被收录的论文较少，１９８７年仅有７９篇，占我国被录论文的１．２％。这表明，农业科研是我国的薄弱环节。
    改革、开放政策为我国打开了了解国际前沿学科最新动态和信息的有效渠道。科技人员参加国际会议的机会增加，发表的论文逐年增多。按收集报道全世界８０—９０％重要科技会议文献的《科学技术会议录索引》统计，１９８７年我国科技工作者在重要国际会议上发表的论文达到１７７４篇，比１９８５年增长１倍多。论文数已超过印度和巴西，达到世界第１４位。
    研究人员认为，索引所选用的期刊和论文都有严格标准，而我国科技刊物和论文的被采用率较低，表明我国学术刊物的质量和论文水平有待提高。我国出口的科技刊物已达２００种，并都有英文版或英文摘要，但被《科学引文索引》选录的仅１１种，而日本被选用的科技期刊多达７１种。同样选１１种，我国被选论文仅１１５９篇，而印度被选录论文达２１１１篇。巴西仅３种刊物，就有９９５篇论文被选录。
