The leadership of the Beijing Military Region Water Engineering Brigade has remained steadfast in the face of money and has consciously maintained a clean and upright style of work. Recently, they were commended by the leadership of the Beijing Military Region. Since its establishment, this brigade has been working hard on the grasslands of Inner Mongolia for over a decade, making outstanding contributions to the hydrogeological survey work in North China and alleviating the water shortage in some agricultural and pastoral areas in northern Inner Mongolia. Since 1986, they have been awarded collective third-class and second-class merits. In the spring of 1987, the higher authorities approved the construction of new barracks and some ancillary projects for the brigade. News of this spread, and more than 20 construction companies expressed their desire to undertake this project. A construction team from a certain place sent two gold rings to the brigade commander, indicating that if they signed the contract, there would be more rewards. This was immediately rejected by the brigade commander. Finally, they selected an engineering company as the successful bidder. During the signing of the contract, the brigade leaders declared that they would not accept a single fen of "kickback," but they must have a first-class project.

　　北京军区给水工程团领导清正廉洁
    本报讯  北京军区给水工程团党委在金钱面前不丧志，自觉保持清正廉洁作风，最近受到北京军区领导机关的表彰。这个给水工程团组建以来，在内蒙古草原艰苦奋战１０多年，为华北地区水文地质普查工作和缓解内蒙古北部一些地区工农牧业用水紧张状况，作出了卓越贡献，１９８６年以来荣立集体三等功和二等功。１９８７年春天，上级批准给水团建新营房和一些附属工程。消息传开后，２０余家建筑公司要求承包这项工程。某地一建筑队派人给郝团长送去两只金戒指，表示如果与他们签定承包合同，还另有重谢，当即被郝团长拒绝。最后他们选定一个工程处为中标单位。在签定承包合同时，团领导申明不收一分钱“回扣”，但必须要一个全优工程。　　　（叶旭林　阎建国　武宝珍）
