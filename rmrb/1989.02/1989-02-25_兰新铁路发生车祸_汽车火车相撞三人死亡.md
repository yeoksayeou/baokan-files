At around 1:20 AM this morning, a collision occurred between a train and a car 52 kilometers east of Tuluofan Station on the Lanxin Railway, resulting in the deaths of three people, serious injuries to 27 others, and a suspension of rail traffic for nearly two hours.

The direct cause of this accident was that a farmer named Abudula, who was driving a passenger car without a license and under the influence of alcohol, was overloading the vehicle with 60 passengers. When he reached an unmanned level crossing, he ignored the train's warning signals and attempted to cross, resulting in a collision with the train.

The train involved was the 245th passenger train traveling from Chengdu to Urumqi.

Following the accident, relevant leaders from the Urumqi Railway Bureau rushed to the scene to handle the aftermath.

　　兰新铁路发生车祸
    汽车火车相撞三人死亡
    本报乌鲁木齐２月２４日电  今晨１时２０分，兰新铁路吐鲁番火车站以东５２公里处发生一起列车与汽车相撞事故，３人死亡，２７人受重伤，铁路中断行车近２个小时。
    造成这起事故的直接原因，是驾驶旅客轿车的农民阿不都拉无照酒后开车。他于２４日晨驾车超载６０人行至无人看守道口时，不顾疾驶而来的由成都开往乌鲁木齐的２４５次旅客列车鸣笛警告，强行通过，被拦腰相撞。
    事故发生后，乌鲁木齐铁路局有关领导连夜赶往现场进行善后处理。
