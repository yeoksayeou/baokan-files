	Travelers carrying large sums of money on trains has become a common occurrence. Money that should be handled through banks is instead circulating outside the system, highlighting the severity of this "external circulation."

	Last December, two passengers at Beijing Railway Station were seen struggling with three suitcases. Upon inspection, the suitcases were found to contain bundles of Renminbi totaling 320,000 yuan. According to the Beijing Railway Bureau's Passenger Department, during the recent spring travel season, checks for flammable and explosive dangerous goods revealed that many passengers were carrying large sums of money, ranging from a few thousand to tens of thousands of yuan. This poses difficulties for operational safety. Incidents of theft involving sums over 10,000 yuan on trains are frequent. From June to December last year, the Beijing Railway Public Security Bureau's Criminal Investigation Department handled 25 cases involving sums over 10,000 yuan, with stolen, robbed, or seized amounts totaling approximately 480,000 yuan. Cases involving amounts under 1,000 yuan are even more numerous. It is estimated that with over 4 million passengers traveling daily, if each carries 100 yuan, then approximately 4 billion yuan in idle funds are circulating on the roads every day.

	According to an analysis by the *Financial Times*, most of those carrying large sums of money are individual business owners. They do not deposit their cash in banks for two reasons: first, they fear exposing their wealth, and second, they fear not being able to withdraw cash quickly when needed. Some are also enterprise procurement staff who do not deposit cash in banks for two reasons: first, they fear inconvenience in using the money, and second, they fear exceeding the "procurement" quota when giving gifts. Additionally, cash transactions for goods also contribute to this economic behavior.

	The tightening of the macro-economy has widened the gap in the supply and demand of funds, further exacerbating the "external circulation" of funds. Currently, the amount of cash in circulation in society has reached 21 billion yuan, but how much of this is circulating outside the banking system? The phenomenon of "money traveling" is thought-provoking: what impact will these unrestrained, surging cash flows have on our economic construction?

### 现金不走银行　却在“体外循环”  携款旅行数额惊人  全国每天约有四亿闲置资金上火车

　　现金不走银行　却在“体外循环”
    携款旅行数额惊人   
    全国每天约有四亿闲置资金上火车
    本报讯  旅客携巨资乘列车走南闯北，已成为一种普遍现象。该通过银行的钱不通过银行，“巨款旅行”从一个侧面暴露了这种“体外循环”的严重性。
    去年底的一天，北京火车站两位旅客拖着三个皮箱蹒跚而行。经检查，皮箱里装满了成捆的人民币，总额达３２万元。据北京铁路局客运处反映，今年春运在开包检查易燃易爆危险品时，发现旅客包内装巨款的现象十分普遍，少则几千，多则几十万元，给运营安全带来了困难。列车上万元以上的巨款被盗案不断发生，去年６月至１２月，北京铁路公安分局刑侦科万元以上的侦破任务就有２５起，被盗、被抢、被劫金额约４８万多元，至于千元以下的盗窃案更是不计其数。据估算，按每天发送４００多万人次旅客计算，每人携带１００元，那么每天闲置在旅途中的资金就有４亿元。
    据《金融时报》分析，携巨款旅行的多数是个体户，他们不将现金存入银行，一是担心露富，二是担心急用现金提不出。也有一部分是企业采购员，他们不把现金存入银行也是有两怕，一怕用钱不方便，二怕送礼时超过“控购”指标。另外，现货交易要用现款，也助长了这种经济行为。
    宏观经济的紧缩，扩大了资金供求的缺口，也加剧了资金的“体外循环”。目前社会上现金流通量已达２１００亿元，其中“体外循环”的资金又是一个多大的数字呢？“票子旅行”的现象发人深思：这些无任何约束的奔涌的现金，对我们的经济建设会带来什么样的影响呢？
