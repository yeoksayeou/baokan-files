Last autumn, during the construction of a high-rise building at Jilin University in Changchun, a construction worker fell to his death due to safety issues. The construction team leader, Shi Yanjun, was subsequently arrested by the South District People's Court of Changchun for the crime of causing a major accident.

When one person falls into trouble, relatives and friends are often at a loss. Shi Yanjun's sister has a son-in-law, Guo, who is considered a "capable person" within the family circle. When her brother fell into trouble, the sister turned to this "capable person" for help. The family gave this "capable person" two packs of Liangyou brand cigarettes and 900 yuan in cash. Less than a month later, perhaps the two packs of Liangyou and 900 yuan really produced "results," Shi Yanjun was released without prosecution.

Shi Yanjun returned home, and the relatives were overjoyed. The "capable person," who had become a hero, was even more pleased. The next day, the "capable person" went to Shi Yanjun's brother's house with a hidden agenda and said, "Uncle was able to return home safely because I spent 3,000 yuan to find someone to help. When Uncle was in 'detention,' they treated him very well, moving him from the shady side to the sunny side. They are really good friends."

Shi Yanjun's brother, hearing this from the "capable person," felt that running around and asking for help was already difficult enough, and he couldn't let the "capable person" spend money. So, he gave the 2,000 yuan that Shi Yanjun had asked him to help buy a refrigerator to the "capable person." The "capable person" gladly accepted it.

All these behind-the-scenes transactions were done without Shi Yanjun's knowledge.

When Shi Yanjun returned home, it happened to be the time when the construction team was short of cash for paying wages. He asked his wife for money, and she said, "All the money in the house, including the money you asked him to help buy the refrigerator, has been spent on you." Shi Yanjun was taken aback: "How was it spent on me?"

"After you were arrested, the family went to find people to plead for you. It was all thanks to our nephew-in-law, who ran around day and night. That's why... well, spending money to avoid disaster."

During his detention, Shi Yanjun learned some legal knowledge. He knew that the law is not a commodity, and prosecutors are not merchants. He was released without prosecution because his crime was "particularly minor." The prosecutor told him this, and the Criminal Law and Criminal Procedure Law also stipulate this. Therefore, he did not believe that he was released because of 3,000 yuan. He was determined to find out the truth. His wife said, "He said he gave 500 yuan each to a doctor, a guard, a prosecutor, and a case handler in the detention center, and also treated them to meals."

"Who was present when these payments were made?"

"No one was there. It was all done by the nephew-in-law alone. He said that if too many people were involved, they wouldn't dare to accept the money."

"I think something is wrong here. Prosecutors won't take money."

" Do you really believe that prosecutors are so honest? Besides, such a relative wouldn't dare to cheat us. Don't think too much about it."

Shi Yanjun shook his head: "Nowadays, some people are so confused by money. A nephew-in-law cheating his uncle is not so strange. I will find out the truth sooner or later."

To find out the truth about the 3,000 yuan, Shi Yanjun talked to his brother, asked his sister, and finally confronted the "capable person." Seeing his uncle come to question him, the "capable person" felt uneasy, but he blamed his uncle for being ungrateful. Shi Yanjun was not convinced and decided to find the four "bribed" law enforcement officers to verify the facts and get to the bottom of the matter.

It so happened that the procuratorial organ was conducting a comprehensive governance campaign and visiting those released without prosecution. The procuratorial officer, Dai Guangdong, who had handled his case, came to the construction site. During their conversation, Shi Yanjun told Dai Guangdong about the 3,000 yuan. Dai Guangdong immediately reported this to the procurator. The procurator felt that the matter was serious and needed to be investigated thoroughly. He assigned the deputy director of the disciplinary inspection department, Qi Jicheng, to handle the case. The "capable person" admitted to the procuratorial officers that he had committed the crime of defrauding 2,900 yuan and two packs of Liangyou cigarettes and was arrested by the procuratorial organ for fraud.

Later, someone asked Shi Yanjun, "How did you know you weren't released because of the money?" Shi Yanjun confidently said, "It was because I learned some law in 'detention.' Learning the law will benefit you greatly!"

Fraud: This refers to the act of using false information or concealing the truth to deceive others into handing over a significant amount of public or private property with the intent to illegally possess it. The object of this crime is the property rights of the state, collective, and individuals. The object of the crime is public and private property. The fraudster uses deception to make the victim believe the lie and willingly hand over the property to the criminal.

　　学法识骗的故事
    吉法
    去年秋天，吉林省长春大学建筑一座高层楼房时，由于施工安全的原因，致使一名建筑工人坠楼死亡。该施工队队长石延启因此而被长春市南关区人民法院以重大责任事故罪逮捕。
    一人“落难”，亲朋好友急得团团转。石延启的妹妹有个女婿郭某，是石家亲朋圈子里的“能人”。哥哥落难，妹妹便找这个“能人”“搭救”，石家一次给这个“能人”两条良友牌香烟和９００元现金。不到１个月，也许是那两条良友和９００块钱真的产生了“效益”，石延启被免诉释放了。
    石延启回家了，乐坏了诸亲朋，而那个成了功臣的“能人”更是笑在眉梢，喜在心头。第二天，“能人”挺胸腆肚地来到石延启弟弟处别有用心地说：“大舅能平安回家来，是我找人花了３０００块啊。大舅在‘号’里时，人家就特别地关照，开始住在阴面后来给调到阳面，人家太够朋友啦。”
    石延启的弟弟听“能人”这么一说，觉得“能人”跑腿求人就够难的，不能让人家搭钱，就把石延启让他帮买电冰箱的２０００元给了这个“能人”。“能人”欣然笑纳。
    这些幕后的交易，都是背着石延启进行的。
    石延启回到家时，正赶上施工队发工资缺少一部分现金，他向妻子要钱，妻子说：“家里的钱包括你让他叔帮买电冰箱的钱都为你花掉了。”石延启听了不觉一愣：“怎么为我花的？”
    “你被捕后，家里人就为你找人说情，多亏咱那个外甥女婿，没黑没白地跑，你才……唉，破财免灾。”
    关押期间，石延启学了一些法律知识，他知道法律不是商品，检察官也不是商人，他之所以能免诉释放，是他的犯罪情节“显著轻微”。检察官是这么告诉他的，《刑法》、《刑事诉讼法》也是这么规定的。因此，他不相信自己是被３０００块钱赎出来的，他决意追问明白。妻子说：“他说给看守所的一个大夫、一个看守员、检察院的一个检察长、一个办案的检察员每人５００元，另外就是请人家吃喝了。”
    “花这些钱时咱家人谁在场？”
    “谁也没去，都是外甥女婿一个人办的，他说人多了人家不敢要。”
    “我觉得这事不对，检察院干部是不会要钱的。”
    “你就那么相信检察官廉洁？再说这样的亲戚还能骗咱？别想那么多了。”
    石延启摇摇头，：“现在的有些人都让钱弄迷糊了，外甥女婿骗舅舅也不是什么奇怪的事。这事我早晚会弄清楚的。”
    为了弄清３０００元钱的去向，石延启找弟弟，问妹妹，最后又找到“能人”。这个“能人”见舅舅来问，心里不免慌惧，但他却指责舅舅没有良心。石延启不信邪，决心去找那４个“受贿”的执法干部核实，查个水落石出。
    事也凑巧，检察机关开展综合治理活动，对免诉释放人员进行回访。曾办理他案子的检察干部戴广东来到工地，谈话中，石延启便把３０００块钱的有关情况告诉戴广东。戴广东立刻向检察长做了汇报。检察长感到问题严重，必须侦查清楚，便派法纪科科长齐继成办理。那个“能人”在检察官面前，承认了诈骗２９００元钱和两条良友香烟的犯罪事实，被检察机关以诈骗罪逮捕。
    事后，有人问石延启：“你怎么会知道你不是被钱赎出来的？”石延启自信地说：“是我在‘号’里学了些法律。学法，将使你受益无穷！”
    诈骗罪：是指以非法占有为目的，用虚构事实或者隐瞒真相的方法，骗取数额较大的公私财物的行为。该罪侵犯的客体是国家、集体和个人的财产权利。侵犯的对象是公私财物。诈骗人用欺骗的手段，使被害人信以为真，从而“自愿”地把财物交给犯罪人。
