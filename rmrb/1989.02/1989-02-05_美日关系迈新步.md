The U.S.-Japan Relationship Takes a New Step

By Zhang Qixun, Our Correspondent

On February 2, President Bush received the first foreign government leader to visit him since taking office—Japanese Prime Minister Takeshita Noboru. After more than two hours of talks, both leaders expressed their desire to elevate the U.S.-Japan relationship to a new level. Although no specific major decisions were announced after the meeting, according to reports from here, the two countries have reached broad consensus on cooperation in the economic, political, and security domains. This seems to indicate that in the late 1980s and 1990s, the U.S.-Japan relationship will take new strides.

Compared to the situation a year ago when Takeshita visited the U.S., the current U.S.-Japan relationship is relatively calm. The two countries' disputes over the export of U.S. beef and citrus have been resolved, and the Japanese government's increase in defense spending and foreign aid in the new budget also meets U.S. wishes. Therefore, there are not many major issues that urgently need to be addressed on the agenda of both sides, providing an opportunity for the leaders of the two countries to discuss less about the present and more about the future.

After the meeting, Prime Minister Takeshita said that this meeting marks a new beginning for U.S.-Japan cooperation, which will help promote world peace and prosperity. President Bush said that for nearly 40 years, the U.S. and Japan have been close friends, respecting each other and needing each other. American newspapers commented on the meeting, saying that the Bush-Takeshita meeting not only established a personal relationship between the leaders of the two countries and a new relationship between the new government and the Takeshita government, but also indicated that the era of Japan being a junior partner of the U.S. has passed. Looking back over the past decade, the situation has indeed changed significantly. In the early 1980s, the U.S. had a small surplus in its international balance of payments, while Japan still had a deficit. But by 1987, the U.S. had an international balance of payments deficit of $180 billion, while Japan had a surplus of $87 billion. Moreover, because the U.S. has become the world's largest debtor, Japan has become the world's largest creditor. Japanese funds are constantly flowing into the U.S., playing an increasingly important role in the U.S. economy, and the two countries are more economically interdependent. Improving U.S.-Japan relations has become a common need for both sides.

The new U.S. government has placed great importance on developing U.S.-Japan relations and has taken formal steps to handle the relationship between the two major economic powers in the world. From the perspective of U.S. diplomacy, if the U.S. wants to deal with the trade and competition challenges it faces, maintain its own economic growth and the stability of the world economy, it needs to rely on Japan's cooperation. For this reason, the new government, shortly after taking office, made friendly gestures toward Japan: announcing that President Bush would attend the funeral of the Japanese Emperor, inviting the Japanese Prime Minister to visit the U.S., and recently appointing a new ambassador to Japan.

The Japanese side is obviously pleased with the new U.S. government's greater emphasis on U.S.-Japan relations, especially when the Takeshita cabinet is troubled by the stock scandal and its reputation is declining. It is even more important to use the Washington visit to make up for political losses and seek to start a new chapter in U.S.-Japan relations on a higher level. As diplomats have said, Takeshita wants to convey the message to the new U.S. government, "Let's put our arguments behind us and focus our energy on doing something together for the globe."

However, the relative calm in U.S.-Japan relations does not mean that there are no problems between the two countries. An article in the Washington Post on February 1 pointed out that the friendly gestures of the leaders cannot magically erase the fundamental conflicts between the U.S. and Japan. For a long time, the imbalance in trade and investment between Japan and the U.S. has been a major problem. This imbalance is still severe. In 1988, Japan's trade surplus with the U.S. decreased but still reached $47.5 billion. Although Japan has taken measures to expand imports, its exports in November and December of last year showed an upward trend, indicating that the effect of the U.S. reducing its trade deficit is not obvious, and Japan's steps to reduce its trade surplus are also small. Based on the experience of the past decade, this is the main factor that causes discord between the U.S. and Japan. At the same time, this has also had a negative impact on the psychology of Americans. Some Americans say that Japan is taking over the U.S., although this statement is exaggerated, it reflects the growing concern that the U.S. is losing control of the economy. In the past, both sides have made various demands on each other to solve trade disputes, but it is often difficult to achieve. The local media pointed out that if both sides want to improve relations and reduce trade imbalances, the best way is for each side to take firm measures in their own countries to change the situation of "excessive consumption in the U.S. and low consumption in Japan." In the Bush-Takeshita meeting, both sides emphasized strengthening economic coordination, but this is still just an indication of intent.

Japan's responsibilities in Western security and solving world economic problems are also issues in U.S.-Japan relations. The U.S. hopes that Japan will contribute more to its due responsibilities, but in this meeting, the leaders of both sides did not discuss this much.

Overall, this meeting focused on creating a good atmosphere for the relationship between the two countries, emphasizing more the intention of the two countries to coordinate policies and strengthen cooperation. Therefore, it can be said that the future trend of U.S.-Japan relations has just begun, or as Bush said when bidding farewell to Takeshita, "We have laid the groundwork for cooperation."

### 美日关系迈新步

　　美日关系迈新步
    本报记者　　张启昕
    ２月２日，布什总统在白宫会见了他上任后第一个来访的外国政府首脑——日本首相竹下登。两国领导人经过两个多小时的会晤，都表示要把美日关系推向一个新阶段。虽然会晤之后双方没有宣布具体的重大决定，但据此间消息，两国在经济、政治和安全领域的合作方面，取得了广泛一致的看法。这似乎表明，在８０年代后期和９０年代，美日关系将迈开新的步子。
    同一年前竹下登访美的情况相比，当前的美日关系处于比较平静的状态。两国关于美国牛肉、柑桔出口问题的争执已经解决，日本政府在新的预算中增加防务费用和对外援助数额，也符合美国的愿望，因此在双方的日程上，急待解决的重大问题不多，这就为两国领导人提供了一种时机，可以较少地谈论当前，更多地展望今后。
    会晤后，竹下登首相称，这次会晤标志着美日合作有了新的开始，有助于世界的和平与繁荣。布什总统则说，近４０年来，美日是紧密的朋友，彼此尊重，同时又互相需要。美国报纸在评论会晤时指出，布什—竹下登会晤不仅仅是建立了两国领导人的个人关系和新政府与竹下登政府的关系，而且还表明，日本作为美国小伙伴的时期已经过去。回顾近十年间，情况确实发生了重大变化。８０年代初，美国的国际收支还有小额顺差，日本仍有逆差，但到１９８７年，美国的国际收支逆差高达１８００亿美元，而日本却有了８７０亿美元顺差。而且由于美国成为世界最大的债务国，日本成了世界的最大债权国，日本巨额资金不断流入美国，在美国经济中作用增大，两国在经济上更加相互依存，搞好美日关系已成为双方的共同需要。
    美国新政府执政后，对发展美日关系十分重视，而且“为处理好两个世界经济大国的关系，采取了正式的步骤”。从美国的外交角度看，如果美国想要对付它面临的贸易和竞争的挑战，保持本国经济继续增长和世界经济的稳定，需要借重日本的合作。正因为这样，新政府在上任不久就对日本作出了友好的姿态：宣布布什总统参加日本天皇葬礼、邀请日本首相访美，不久前又任命了新的驻日本大使。
    日本方面显然对美国新政府更加重视美日关系的行动表示欣慰，特别是在竹下登内阁受到股票丑闻的困扰、声望下降的时候，更要借华盛顿之行之机，弥补政治上的损失，并设法寻求“在更高台基上开始美日关系的新一页”。正如外交界人士所说，竹下登想要给美国新政府带来的信息是，“让我们把争吵抛在后边，而把精力集中在共同为全球做些什么上”。
    然而，美日关系的相对平静并不等于两国间不存在问题。《华盛顿邮报》２月１日的一篇文章指出，领导人的友好姿态并不能像变魔术那样把美日间的基本冲突抹掉。长期以来，日美贸易和投资方面的不平衡就是一大难题。这种不平衡目前依然严重。１９８８年，日本对美贸易顺差有所减少，但仍达４７５亿美元，日本虽然采取措施扩大进口，但去年１１、１２月间的出口又呈上升趋势，这表明美国减少贸易赤字的效果不够明显，而日本减少贸易盈余的步子迈得也不大。根据近十年来的经验，这是美日之间产生不和的主要因素。同时，这在美国人的心理上也产生了不良影响。美国一部分人说日本正在接管美国，这种说法虽然夸大其词，但却反映出人们愈来愈担心美国失去对经济的控制。以往，双方为解决贸易纷争总是彼此向另一方提出种种要求，但往往不容易办到。此间舆论界指出，如果双方要改善关系，减少贸易不平衡，最好的办法是各自在本国采取坚定的措施，改变“美国过度消费、日本过低消费”的现状。在布什─竹下登会晤中，双方强调加强经济协调，但这还只是表明一种意向。
    日本在西方安全方面和解决世界经济问题方面应承担什么责任，也是美日关系中的一个问题，美国是希望日本多拿出一点顺差来尽它应有的责任，但在这次会晤中，双方领导人谈得不多。
    总的来说，这次会晤偏重于创造两国关系的良好气氛，更多地强调两国协调政策、加强合作的意向，因此可以说，美日关系的今后趋向还只是刚刚开了一个头，或者用布什告别竹下登时的话来说，“为合作奠定了基础工作”。
