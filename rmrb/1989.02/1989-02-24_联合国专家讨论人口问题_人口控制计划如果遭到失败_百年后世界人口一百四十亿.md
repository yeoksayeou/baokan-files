UN experts predict that if the world's population continues to grow at the current rate, the global population may stabilize at 10 billion in the next 100 years. If population control plans are fully successful, the global population will not exceed 8 billion by 2100. However, if these plans fail, the world's population could reach 14 billion.

Therefore, experts believe that the current growth of the world's population is at a crossroads.

According to materials released at the meeting, the current annual growth rate of the world's population is 1.7%, and it is in a "stable period," which is expected to last until the end of the 1990s.

The two-day meeting of the UN Population Commission concluded today. Attendees also heard reports on issues such as the increasing number of people using contraception, the declining infant mortality rate, and the increasing average lifespan.

The Chinese representative introduced China's family planning situation at the meeting.

According to a report by the Zaire News Agency today, Africa's population is growing at an alarming rate. It is predicted that by 2025, 8 African countries will be among the 25 most populous countries in the world.

Africa's population growth rate has exceeded 2.5%, with North Africa at 2.7%, Central Africa at 2.9%, West Africa at 3%, and East Africa at 3.1%.

Africa's total population has already surpassed 550 million. Some African population experts have called on their governments to control the birth rate, believing that a high birth rate will hinder Africa's economic development.

　　联合国专家讨论人口问题
    人口控制计划如果遭到失败  百年后世界人口一百四十亿
    非洲人口增长过快令人不安
    新华社联合国２月２２日电　出席联合国人口委员会会议的专家们预测，如果世界人口按目前速度增长，在今后１００年内全球人口可能稳定在１００亿。倘若人口控制计划获得完全成功，全球人口到２１００年将不超过８０亿，但如果失败，那时世界人口将达到１４０亿。
    因此专家们认为，目前世界人口的增长正处在十字路口。
    根据会上公布的材料，目前世界人口的年增长率为１．７％，正处于“平稳时期”，它可望保持到九十年代末。
    为期两天的联合国人口委员会会议今天结束。与会代表还听取了有关世界节育人数增多、婴儿死亡率下降和平均寿命的增长等问题的报告。
    中国代表在会上介绍了中国实行计划生育的情况。
    新华社金沙萨２月２２日电　据扎伊尔通讯社今天报道，非洲人口正在令人不安地增长，预计到２０２５年将有８个非洲国家列入世界人口最多的２５个国家中。
    非洲人口增长率已超过２．５％，其中北非为２．７％，中非为２．９％，西非为３％，东非为３．１％。
    非洲人口总数已超过５．５亿；一些非洲人口专家呼吁本国政府注意控制人口出生率，并认为过高的人口出生率会阻碍非洲的经济发展。
