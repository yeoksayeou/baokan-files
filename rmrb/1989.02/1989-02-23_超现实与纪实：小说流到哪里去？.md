The novel creation of 1988 or even earlier in 1987 has been continuously generating new elements, but it has not yet formed a significant trend, nor has it created a major wave or produced outstanding results. However, this does not mean there is nothing to say.

As expected at the beginning of the year, 1988 was the "year of reportage literature." In fact, the wave of reportage literature has been impacting the literary shore from the start, capturing the readers of pure literature. It was only in 1988, in this special year, that it reached its peak. With the continuous political openness and the gradual increase in transparency, and because readers pay special attention to social reality and news has not yet fully opened up, people demand that literature provide more social information and news elements. At this time, some reportage literature writers began to "overstep" their boundaries, and reportage literature with cultural reflections emerged one after another, becoming very popular for a time, squeezing novels to the point of being almost unrecognizable.

This situation and the hot air flow cannot but disturb the mindset of novelists and influence the internal direction and artistic mechanism of novel creation. Thus, in recent years, novels have shown two new trends: one is the infiltration of some realistic elements, making novels more realistic and mundane, aligning with the "realism trend"; the other is the emphasis on the fictionality of literature, constructing a surreal world of spiritual illusions, which is a counter-reaction to the "realism trend."

The first trend mainly comes from some realistic writers, including some new writers like Liu Heng, Wang Shuo, Liu Zhenyun, and social attitude novelists like Chen Rong, as well as writers like Wang Meng who are not so realistic. Of course, they are not completely aligned with "non-fiction" or completely using "non-fiction" methods. They only seek a realistic reading effect to eliminate or shorten the aesthetic distance. Liu Heng's "Black Snow" describes the story of a "wayward youth." What attracts readers the most is the author's small "trick" in the novel's background: he completely newsified the location of the story, Dongda Bridge, Shenlu Street, Xiaozhuang, Guandong Shop, and Hujia Lou are all real existences in life, and even the yellow small building and photo studio near Dongda Bridge are exactly the same as those in real life. This strengthens the reader's reading sensation (especially for readers in the Beijing area), using a seemingly realistic method to enhance the readability and comprehensibility of the novel, thereby expanding the novel's readership. Liu Heng's novella "White Whirlpool" also has similar handling.

This handling method is clever and cunning. It not only allows readers to obtain an objective realistic effect in reading but also allows the author to have a stable narrative framework for novel creation, thus the writer does not need to rack their brains over the spatial structure (regional environment) of the story, and can simply copy and restore the original situation in life. The purpose of doing so is also to "deceive" the readers: this is true, I did not fabricate it. This actually reflects the author's certain recognition of the "realism trend" and a certain ridicule of fictional imagination.

Different from this background real-life story fictional tendency is a class of writers' autobiographical realistic penmanship. Lao Gui's novel "Blood Red Twilight" directly titles it as "New Journalism" on the cover, which further indicates the author's yearning and admiration for realistic effects. Although the novel is far from Western "New Journalism," as an autobiographical novel, it does not lose its unique value. Its courage, its ruthlessness, and its stimulation all gain a realistic reading effect due to a realistic method, to the extent that people forget that it is a novel and do not consider its artistic value. It is Wang Shuo, Liu Zhenyun, and Cha Jianying's novels that have made small progress in narrative art. This progress mainly manifests in the lovable narrators in their novels—"I." Wang Shuo's "Rascal," "Playing with Heartbeats," Liu Zhenyun's "Tower," "New Recruit Camp," and Cha Jianying's "The Past is a Stone's Throw Away," "Ice River Under the Jungle" are all presented in a quasi-autobiographical form. They all, to a great extent, use or mobilize personal experiences, inject personal life experiences and emotional experiences, and thus have obvious autobiographical colors, which makes the novel shrouded in a strong realistic and confessional nature. But reading experience tells us that it is still a novel. The entire structure of the work is supported by "I," the narrator, and the author thus gains great flexibility. On the one hand, it can pour in personal experiences and experiences, and on the other hand, it can casually fabricate those coincidental or poetic or conflict-rich or quite humorous plot details, but it can still achieve a realistic effect.

Some people are not satisfied with this realistic novel. There have already been more than one writer and critic exclaiming that "Chinese writers lack imagination" or "imagination crisis" and "degeneration of imagination." In fact, there has appeared a novel trend that is quite different from the "realism trend," which is the emergence of a group of novels and novelists with surrealist characteristics. These novelists, before engaging in novel operations, almost all had experience with poetry. Sun Ganlu, Su Tong, Ge Fei, Shen Hongfei, Bei Cun, and others had once dreamed of being great poets. In theory, they have obviously been directly or indirectly influenced by the surrealist school, and in practice, they admire the famous Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges to the extreme, even secretly imitating or secretly transplanting. Therefore, their novels are shrouded in a dreamlike color, and time and space often lose their natural precise boundaries and directions, completely a "subconscious writing" of the writer's "spiritual automatism." The most famous of these dream-like novels is Sun Ganlu's "Visiting the Dream World" and "The Messenger's Letter," especially the former's highly imaginative and linguistically acute power, which makes all realistic literature seem pale and shallow, truly a difference between the fairy world and the mundane world. Su Tong is also a young man who relies on imagination, and his novella "Escape in 1934" presents a scene that he has never experienced, but a realm in spiritual illusions. This is very dangerous and requires great courage, as success or failure depends entirely on the strength of imagination and language. Yu Hua's novels, although many are characterized by strong and cruel life phenomena, his "Smoke of Life" deliberately weakens and simplifies the realistic content, turning those factual concretizations into linear abstract symbols, thus possessing a more surreal dreamlike atmosphere. Ge Fei's "Brown Bird Flock" is a much-criticized novella. This Borges-like fantasy novel indeed confused many people, to the extent that someone in this kind of maze angrily declared reading failure and then announced Ge Fei's incompetence. This work is far from being as loved by people as his light-type technique stories "Big Year" and "Lost Boat." This is indeed the greatest sadness of surreal novels. Breton pointed out in "The Surrealist Manifesto": "The basis of surrealism is the belief in the high reality of certain association forms that have been neglected before, the omnipotence of dreams, and the unbiased activity of thought. Its goal is to destroy all other spiritual mechanicism and replace it with solving the main problems of life." Therefore, these novelists, although emphasizing the role of dreams, do not intend to oppose the dream world and the real world, but try to make the two consistent through emphasizing the reality of the dream world, to achieve a "surreal" effect, to ridicule the mediocrity and vulgarity of realistic literature.

In the novel creation of 1988, Wang Meng's novels are also worth noting. This is his injection of some very realistic content into some surrealist structural frameworks. It can be represented by his 1988 works "On the Cross," "The Ball Star's Adventure," and "The Wave of the Sea." "On the Cross" opens up a very clever intermediate zone between the two incompatible literary qualities of realism and surrealism, connecting the two different bridges with the protagonist "I." "I" is sometimes the "I" of news truth, and sometimes the "I" of existence in illusions. The two "I"s appear alternately, both isolated from each other and responding to each other, creating an effect that is both familiar and strange. Such a structure that is both real and absurd is almost throughout Wang Meng's recent novels, and the paradoxical effect it creates is quite thought-provoking.

It can be seen that the shock wave of realistic literature has affected all levels of novels, causing various changes in novelists and novel creation. Novelists taking the above adjustment steps to adapt to the new literary situation is inevitable. However, it is necessary to be vigilant that in emphasizing realism, one should not make the mistake of vulgarity, and in creating a world of illusions, one should not fall into the quagmire of self-love and be unable to extricate oneself. In fact, some quite excellent writers and some quite excellent novels are also confused in the face of the impact of realistic literature, weakening their confidence. Mo Yan's novel "The Song of the Heavenly Garlic" perhaps, in order to obtain some realistic benefits, directly uses a "real-life event" as the ignition point for creation. This is also understandable, but the Mo Yan who feels crazy and explosive is not suitable for this realistic work. The former leisurely and unhurried genius is everywhere at a loss or idle. This is a lesson to be learned. Chen Rong's "Lazy to Divorce" is also a rare realistic novel of the year, but in structure, it intentionally imitates the "macro" reportage literature that is popular nowadays. The reading effect produced by the combination of those small units makes "Lazy to Divorce" appear in a "non-novel" state. This is not advisable. Because facing the challenge of realistic literature, the novel should have its own artistic level, aesthetic level, and reading level. Simply identifying with reportage literature can only lose the nature of the novel.

### 超现实与纪实：小说流到哪里去？

　　超现实与纪实：
    小说流到哪里去？
    王干
    １９８８年或者更早一点的１９８７年的小说创作，始终在滋生新的因素，只是始终没有形成较大的气候，没有兴起大的浪潮，也没有结出硕大果实。但这并不意味着无话可说。
    正像年初人们预料的那样，１９８８年是“报告文学年”。事实上纪实文学的浪潮从一开始就冲击文学的堤岸，掳掠纯文学的读者。只是到了１９８８年这样一个特殊的年头走向了顶峰。随着政治上的不断开放与透明度的缓缓加大，也因为读者对社会现实的格外关注和新闻尚未完全开化，人们便要求文学提供更多的社会信息量和新闻因素。这个时候一些报告文学作家便开始“越位”作业，文化思考的报告文学便纷纷出笼，一时甚嚣尘上，把小说挤得干瘪，几无站脚之地。
    这种态势与热气流不能不干扰小说作家的心态，不能不影响小说创作的内在走向和艺术机制。于是，近年来的小说便出现了两股新的流向，一股便是渗进了一些纪实性的因素，使小说更加现实化、世俗化，是向“纪实热”认同的；一股便是加重文学的虚构性，超现实地营构心灵的幻象世界，这是对“纪实热”的反拨。
    前一股流向主要源于一些纪实型的作家，包括一些新进的作家像刘恒、王朔、刘震云等人，也包括谌容这样的社会心态小说家和并不那么写实的小说家王蒙，当然他们并不是完全向“非小说”认同，也并不是完全的“非小说”方式，他们只是企求一种纪实性的阅读效果，以消除或缩短审美的距离感。刘恒的《黑的雪》描写的是一位“失足青年”的故事。最能吸引读者注意的是作者在小说背景上耍了小小的“伎俩”：他把故事发生的地点完全新闻化，东大桥、神路街、小庄、关东店、呼家楼全是生活中真实的存在，以及连东大桥那一片黄色的小楼与照相馆，都同生活中的存在一模一脱，这就强化了读者的阅读实感（尤其是北京地区的读者），以貌似纪实的方式来强化小说的可读性、可捉摸性以扩展小说的阅读面。在刘恒的中篇小说《白涡》里也有类似的处理。
    这种处理方式是一种聪明而狡黠的，它不仅为读者在阅读上能获取一种客观性的纪实效果，而且也使自己构思小说能够有一个稳定的叙述框架，也就使作家在叙述故事的空间结构（地域环境）不必苦思冥想，而按照生活中的本来情形照搬还原就行了。这么做的目的也在于“瞒骗”读者：这是真的，我没有虚构。这实际反映作者对“纪实热”的某种认可和对虚构想象的某种调侃。
    与这种背景实化故事虚化的写实倾向不同的是一类作家的自传式的纪实笔法。老鬼的长篇小说《血色黄昏》在封面上直接冠之以“新新闻主义”，更表明了作者对纪实性效应的向往与奉承。尽管小说与西方的“新新闻主义”相去甚远，但作为一种自传体小说却不失其独特的价值，它的勇气、它的冷酷、它的刺激，均因一种纪实性的方式而获得一种逼真的阅读效果，以至使人们忘记了它是一部小说而不去考究它的艺术价值。倒是王朔、刘震云、查建英等人的小说在叙述艺术上有了小小的长进，这种长进主要表现在他们小说中的可爱的叙事人——“我”。王朔的《顽主》、《玩的就是心跳》，刘震云的《塔铺》、《新兵连》，查建英的《往事离此一箭之遥》、《丛林下的冰河》，都是以一种拟自传体的形式出现的，他们都在很大程度上运用或调动了个人的经历，投注了个人的生活经验和情感经验，因而带有明显的自传色彩，这便使小说笼上了浓郁的纪实性和自白性。但阅读经验告诉我们它又是小说。作品的整个结构全由“我”这个叙事人支撑，作者由此获得巨大的灵活性，它一方面可以倾注个人的经历和经验，又可以漫不经心地虚构那些巧合的或富有诗意的或富有冲突的或颇具幽默效果的情节和细节，但同样可以取得一种纪实性效应。
    也有人对这种纪实性的写实小说不以为然。已经有不止一个作家和评论家惊呼“中国作家没有想象力”或者说“想象的危机”“想象力的退化”。事实上也出现了这样一股与“纪实热”大相异趣的小说热流，这便是一批具有超现实主义特征的小说和小说家的出现。这些小说家在从事小说操作之前差不多都染指过诗歌，孙甘露、苏童、格非、沈宏菲、北村等人都曾经做过大诗人的梦。在理论上他们显然直接或间接受到过超现实主义流派的影响，在实践上他们对阿根廷的著名作家博尔赫斯推崇至极，甚至在偷偷地模仿或暗暗地移植。因此他们的小说笼罩着一层梦幻色彩，时间和空间也往往失去了自然的确切的界限与流向，完全是作家“精神自动性”的一种“下意识书写”。这种仿梦小说最著名的是孙甘露的《访问梦境》、《信使之函》，尤其是前者所表现出的高度想象力和语言敏锐力着实使所有的纪实性文学变得苍白浅陋起来，真有仙境与尘世之别。苏童更是依仗想象力的一位青年，他的中篇小说《一九三四年的逃亡》所呈现的是他完全没有经历过的场景，而是精神幻象中的一种境界。这样既脱离史料又不用别人的经验抒写“历史”是很危险的，也是需要很大勇气的，成功与否全在于想象力和语言两能力的强弱。余华的小说尽管有不少是以强烈的残酷的生活现象为内容特征，但他的《世事如烟》却故意淡化简化写实性的内涵，把那些事实具象处理成为线条式的抽象语符，从而更具有一种超现实的梦魔氛围。格非的《褐色鸟群》是一篇颇遭指责的中篇小说，这种博尔赫斯式的幻象虚设的造梦小说确实迷惑了不少人，以至有人在这类迷宫中气急败坏地宣告阅读的失败继而宣布格非的拙劣，这部作品远不如他的那些轻型的技巧故事《大年》、《迷舟》为人们喜爱。这着实是超现实小说最大的悲哀。布勒东在《超现实主义宣言》里指出：“超现实主义的基础是相信在它之前一直遭到忽视的某些联想形式的高度真实性，相信梦幻的万能，相信思想的不偏不倚的活动。它的目的是要摧毁其他一切精神机械论并取而代之，以解决人生的主要问题。”因此这些小说家虽然强调梦幻的作用，但并没有想把梦幻世界与现实世界对立起来，而是企图通过强调梦幻世界的真实性使这两者一致起来，以获得一种“超现实”效果，以嘲笑纪实文学的平乏与媚俗。
    在１９８８年的小说创作中，王蒙的有一类小说也值得注意。这就是他在一些超现实主义的结构框架中灌注一些非常写实的现实性内容。可以他１９８８年的《十字架上》、《球星奇遇记》、《海之波》为代表。《十字架上》在纪实与超实两种水火不相容的文学质之间拓开了一个非常巧妙的中间地带，连接两种异质的桥梁是主人公“我”，“我”一会儿是新闻真实的“我”，一会儿又是幻象存在中的“我”，两个“我”交相出现，既互相隔离，又互相呼应，造成了一种既熟悉又陌生的效果。这样一种既真实而又荒诞的复合的“我”，既观照出生活中的种种乖谬现象，又自然地坦露出自我心灵的真声。这样一种结构方式几乎贯串了王蒙近期小说，它所造成的悖反效应是很耐人寻味的。
    可见纪实文学的震动波及到小说各个层面，引起了小说家和小说创作的各种变化。小说家采取上述调整的步骤以适应新的文学态势是必然的。但需要警惕的是，在强调纪实性的时候切不可犯媚俗的错误，而营造幻象世界时也不可堕入自恋的泥潭不可自拔。事实上，一些颇为优秀的作家、一些颇为优秀的小说在纪实热的冲击下也不免乱了方寸，削弱了自信。莫言的长篇小说《天堂蒜薹之歌》或许是为了得到某种纪实性的效益，是直接以生活中的一个“事件”作为创作的引爆点的，这又何尝不可，但感觉疯狂爆炸的莫言却不适宜这项纪实性的工作，昔日从容不迫的才子处处显得措手不及或无所事事。这是必须引以为鉴的。谌容的《懒得离婚》也是该年度的难得的写实小说，但在结构上，却有意模仿时下流行的“宏观”的报告文学的作法，那些小小单元组合起来所产生的阅读效果使《懒得离婚》呈“非小说化”状态。这是不可取的。因为面对纪实文学的挑战，小说应该有自己的艺术层面、审美层面、阅读层面，这样简单地对报告文学进行认同，只能丧失小说的本性。
