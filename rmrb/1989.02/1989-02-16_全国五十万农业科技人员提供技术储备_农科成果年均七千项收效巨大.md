	Nation's 500,000 Agricultural Scientists Provide Technical Reserve
		Agricultural Science Achievements Yield 7,000 Items Annually with Significant Results

	According to statistics from relevant departments, over the past 10 years, China's 500,000 agricultural science and technology personnel have contributed approximately 7,000 scientific and technological achievements to society each year. By the end of 1988, around 25,000 of these achievements had received provincial, Ministry of Agriculture, and national-level awards. These achievements have provided a substantial technical reserve for the rural economy.

	The promotion of these projects has brought significant wealth to society. In the field of planting, China's agricultural system has, from 1983 to 1988, focused on promoting 627 projects, achieving direct economic benefits of 40.4 billion yuan. In just the three years since 1986, the area of technology promotion has nearly reached the total cultivated land area of the country, increasing grain production by 47.1 billion kilograms, equivalent to an increase of over 30 kilograms per mu of cultivated land.

	China's plastic film coverage area has been at the world's forefront since 1984. This "white revolution" was introduced to China in 1979 and has since developed into a complete plastic film coverage cultivation technology system. From 1982 to 1987, a total of 11.8 million mu were promoted, with an added value of 8.5 billion yuan. Last year, despite repeated price increases for agricultural film, the usage area still exceeded 30 million mu.

　　全国五十万农业科技人员提供技术储备    
    农科成果年均七千项收效巨大
    据新华社北京２月１４日电  （记者鹿永建）据有关部门统计，在过去的１０年中，我国５０万农业科技人员平均每年向社会奉献约７０００项科技成果。到１９８８年底，已有２．５万项左右获省级、农业部和国家级奖励。这些成果为农村经济提供了巨大的技术储备。
    这些项目的推广给社会带来巨大财富。在种植业领域，我国农业系统自１９８３年至１９８８年，重点推广了６２７个项目，获直接经济效益４０４亿元。仅１９８６年后这３年，技术推广面积就接近于我国耕地总面积，多打粮４７１亿公斤，相当于全国每亩耕地增收３０多公斤。
    我国地膜覆盖面积１９８４年开始居世界领先地位。这场“白色革命”自１９７９年传入中国，现已形成完整的地膜覆盖栽培技术体系。１９８２至１９８７年的７年里，累计推广１．１８亿亩，增值８５亿元。去年，农膜价格一涨再涨，使用面积仍突破３０００万亩。
