The research project for compiling the "Dialect Gazetteers for Each County and City in Shanxi Province" was led by the Language Research Institute of the Shanxi Provincial Academy of Social Sciences. Over the course of eight years, 52 scholars from within and outside the province have completed the writing of approximately 10 million characters.
