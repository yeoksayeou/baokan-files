The Communist Party of China's Changde City Committee in Hunan Province has been implementing an open recommendation, assessment, and recruitment system for cadres, which has significantly increased the transparency of cadre work and effectively curbed improper practices in personnel selection. Over the past five years, more than 500 outstanding young and middle-aged cadres have been selected for county-level and above leadership positions. Nearly 300 incompetent cadres at the section-level and above have been removed from their posts, and over 100 county-level cadres have been reassigned to different positions.

In recent years, the Changde City Committee has adopted an open approach to selecting leading cadres, which includes publicly announcing job positions, the number of vacancies, and the qualifications required. This method has been used to select over 150 outstanding talents for the city and county leadership teams in 1985. In 1988, when Changde was converted from a district to a city, the original district committee organized 230 people from the city and counties to democratically recommend members for the five major leadership teams, following legal procedures for their formation. During the adjustment of the city's administrative leadership teams, the city committee organized over 2,000 cadres to democratically recommend and conduct opinion polls, resulting in the promotion of 40 individuals from a pool of 300 recommended candidates.

To enhance the transparency of cadre assessments, the Changde City Committee first implemented the "Cadres' Moral and Ability Evaluation Method," breaking down cadre qualities into several dozen elements. They organized the masses to fill out evaluation forms, expanding the assessment information and increasing the comparability of candidates. Second, they shared the assessment results with the cadres, allowing them to defend, explain, and retain their positions, helping cadres understand public evaluations and areas for improvement. Third, they promoted the annual work evaluation method for county-level party and government leaders across the city, where cadres publicly report their work, and the organization and masses publicly evaluate them, with the results made public. A total of 410 county-level cadres participated in public reporting, receiving evaluations from over 12,000 people. Twenty county-level leaders were removed from their positions due to significant public dissatisfaction and poor performance.

The Changde City Committee also used broadcasts, television, and social advertisements to publicly recruit and directly appoint enterprise managers. Currently, over 50 city-owned enterprises have adopted this method to select leading cadres. The city has recruited 1,600 township cadres, with 270 of them being elected as deputy mayors, party committee secretaries, or equivalent positions. Departments such as the Bureau of Industry and Commerce, the Military Affairs Bureau, the Personnel Bureau, and the Light Industry Bureau have also implemented public recruitment for leading cadres.

　　破除神秘感　提高透明度   
    常德公开推荐考核招聘干部
    本报讯  中共湖南省常德市委在干部工作中坚持公开推荐、公开考核、公开招聘方式，增强了干部工作的透明度，避免了用人上的不正之风。近５年来，全市有５００多名优秀中青年干部被选上县级以上领导岗位，近３００名不胜任现职的科级以上干部被免职，１００多名县级干部异地换位。
    近几年来，常德市委在选拔领导干部时，实行公开职位，公开职数，公开任职条件，进行公开推荐和选拔。１９８５年，全市通过这种办法选拔了１５０多名优秀人才进入地县市领导班子。１９８８年常德撤区建市，原地委组织地县市２３０多人对五大领导班子成员进行民主推荐，按照法律程序组建。在调整市直机关领导班子中，市委又组织２０００多名干部进行民主推荐和民意测验，推荐出３００多名人选，从中提拔４０人。
    常德市委为提高干部考核公开化的程度，首先实行“干部德才素质测评方法”，将干部素质分解为几十个要素，组织群众填写测评量表，扩大了考核信息量，增强了选人的可比性；其次把考核结果同干部本人见面，允许干部分辩、解释和保留，使干部看到群众评价和努力方向。再次是在全市范围内推广县级党政机关领导干部年度工作考评方法，由干部公开述职，组织干部群众公开评议，并将考核结果公开。全市有４１０余名县级干部参加公开述职，接受１２０００多名群众的公开评议，有２０名县级领导干部因群众意见大、工作成绩平平，不胜任现职而被市委免职。
    常德市委还通过广播电视、社会广告等办法，公开招聘和直接聘用企业经营者，目前已有５０多家市属企业实行这种方式选拔领导干部。全市招聘乡镇干部１６００人，其中被选举担任正副乡（镇）长、党委正副书记或同级干部的有２７０人。工商局、武装部、人事局、二轻局等机关内部也实行了公开招聘领导干部。
