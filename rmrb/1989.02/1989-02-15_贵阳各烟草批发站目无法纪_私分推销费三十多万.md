Various tobacco wholesale stations in Guiyang disregard the law and regulations and privately divide commission fees totaling over 300,000 yuan.

A report from our Guiyang correspondent, Pan Di Du and Hu Yue Ping: The situation of arbitrarily issuing commission fees is very serious at the various tobacco wholesale stations under the Guiyang Branch of the Guizhou Province Tobacco Company. Recently, after an audit and investigation by the Guiyang Municipal Audit Bureau, it was discovered that the subordinate tobacco wholesale stations have, since last year, privately divided commission fees totaling 310,000 yuan, averaging nearly 3,000 yuan per person. The first wholesale station, which distributed the most, had an average of 6,700 yuan per person.

Upon investigation, it was found that from April to September last year, the various wholesale stations, according to a standard of 5 yuan per box, directly divided 138,000 yuan of the 200,000 yuan in commission fees into cash among the employees, averaging 1,300 yuan per person, with some individuals receiving as much as 2,600 yuan. From August to September last year, the provincial tobacco company's cigarette sales company expanded the standard for issuing commission fees, giving one box of high-grade soft-mouth "Guiyan" cigarettes (provided by the factory) for every box of grade B cigarettes sold. Calculating at the wholesale price of 20.64 yuan per box of "Guiyan" cigarettes, the commission fee standard was increased fourfold. Thus, the various wholesale stations became even more brazen, dividing all 8,432 boxes of "Guiyan" cigarettes obtained in about two months as off-the-books materials, using various methods to privately divide them.

The office of the Guiyang Municipal Taxation, Finance, and Price Inspection Leading Group issued a circular criticizing this case of violating regulations and pursuing the responsibility of the relevant personnel. The amount of money involved in the violations that has been verified will all be confiscated by the municipal finance department.

　　贵阳各烟草批发站目无法纪    
    私分推销费三十多万
    本报贵阳电  记者潘帝都、胡跃平报道：贵州省烟草公司贵阳市分公司所属各烟草批发站滥发推销费情况十分严重。最近经贵阳市审计局审计调查，发现下属各烟批站从去年以来，私分推销费共３１万元，人均近３０００元，发放最多的第一批发站人均高达６７００元。
    经查实，各批发站从去年４月至９月，按每箱５元的标准，将推销费２０余万元中的１３．８万元直接用现金私分到职工手中，人均得１３００余元，有的人均高达２６００余元。去年８月至９月，省烟草公司卷烟销售公司又扩大了推销费的发放标准，每销售一箱乙级烟，奖给高级软嘴“贵烟”一条（由烟厂发给），按每条“贵烟”批发价２０．６４元计算，一下子将推销费标准提高４倍。于是各批发站更变本加厉，将两个月左右获得的８４３２条“贵烟”，全部作为账外物资，采用各种手法私分。
    贵阳市税收财务物价大检查领导小组办公室对这起违纪事件进行通报批评，并追究有关人员的责任，对已查实的违纪金额，一律收缴市财政。
