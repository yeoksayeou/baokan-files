Since the second half of last year, China's energy supply has suddenly become tight across the board. Coal, oil, and electricity are all in short supply, with many factories operating at reduced capacity, some even stopping production for five days and running for only two. Frequent power outages and restrictions have severely affected economic development and people's lives.

Entering 1989, this tight situation has not eased in some regions but has instead worsened. According to officials from the East China Power Grid, this year's electricity and coal shortages are increasing rather than decreasing. From January 1 to 20, the average daily power outage due to coal shortages was 789,000 kilowatts, peaking at 1.35 million kilowatts on January 14. Currently, power plants in Xuzhou, Chenpi, Zhenhai, Wangcheng, and Shidongkou have stopped operations. The highly anticipated Baoshan Steel Complex is facing the threat of shutdown due to a tight supply of coking coal, and a 350,000-kilowatt generator has been forced to stop due to a lack of coal for power generation. The entire East China Power Grid has reduced power generation by 387 million kilowatt-hours.

Last year, China's raw coal production reached 960 million tons, an increase of 32.5 million tons over 1987; crude oil production reached 137 million tons, an increase of 30 million tons over the previous year; and electricity generation was 539 billion kilowatt-hours, an increase of over 40 billion kilowatt-hours. People wonder: despite the overproduction of coal, over-generation of electricity, and over-extraction of oil, why is the energy supply, especially electricity, so tight nationwide?

The fundamental reason is economic overheating. In recent years, industrial development, especially in processing industries and township enterprises, has been too rapid, and energy production has not kept up with economic growth. During the Sixth Five-Year Plan period, the total industrial and agricultural output value increased by 68%, while primary energy only increased by 34%, and electricity generation increased by 37%. In the first two years of the Seventh Five-Year Plan, the total industrial and agricultural output value increased by an average of over 14% per year, while primary energy only increased by about 3%, half of that during the Sixth Five-Year Plan; electricity generation increased by 10%. Especially, the ratio of power generation equipment to power consumption equipment is seriously imbalanced, with 1:2.5 in 1986 and 1:2.79 in 1987, now approaching 1:3. Currently, coal and electricity are the most strained in the coastal regions of East China and South China. Except for Shanghai, the industrial growth rate in this region last year was around 30%. Such rapid economic growth makes it impossible for energy production to keep up.

However, economic overheating did not happen overnight, and the supply of energy has been insufficient for a long time. Why has this contradiction become so prominent since the second half of last year? According to an official from the Energy Department, one important reason is that non-planned coal use has squeezed out planned coal for power generation, and many large power plants have not received coal according to the plan. Last year, the coal delivery rate for planned use in the country's four major power grids was only 92.6%, and in the East China Power Grid, it was only 86%, with a cumulative shortfall of over 8 million tons of coal for power generation, affecting power plant operations. In October last year, at a meeting convened by the State Planning Commission, it was decided that the winter reserve of coal for power generation nationwide should not be less than 600 million tons. In reality, the current inventory is less than 400 million tons, and many power plants have not increased their coal reserves this year but have continued to decrease. The coal inventory in the East China Power Grid decreased by 2.9 million tons in January compared to the same period last year. Some power plants in Shanghai have less than two days of coal reserves. The five major reservoirs in the Northeast Power Grid suffered severe drought and over-planned electricity use last year, with water levels dropping and hydroelectric power generation insufficient; on the other hand, the coal inventory in thermal power plants is also decreasing, with a decrease of 500,000 tons from January 1 to 15.

The lessons from this energy-tight situation are profound. It once again reminds us that without the development of the energy industry, other industries cannot develop. In planning the national economy, we must reasonably determine the growth rate of industry and agriculture based on energy production capacity. If the growth exceeds energy production, economic overheating will inevitably be punished by objective laws. In the current rectification and adjustment, various places must firmly adjust those processing industries with high energy consumption and low economic benefits, and those township enterprises that develop blindly and have low economic benefits. There can be no more hesitation.

In addition, non-planned coal use has squeezed out planned coal use, which is a lesson. Why has coal for power generation not been supplied according to the plan? According to investigations, the main reason is that some units and leaders, disregarding overall interests, have issued unauthorized orders and arbitrarily dug into the coal supply for power plants. Relevant departments are investigating this serious illegal behavior. Where did hundreds of millions of tons of coal for power generation go? This must be investigated thoroughly.

### 我国能源为何全面紧张？

　　我国能源为何全面紧张？
    本报记者  刘燮阳
    从去年下半年开始，我国能源供应突然全面紧张，各地缺煤、缺油、缺电，许多工厂停三开四，有的地区停五开二，城乡频繁拉闸限电，严重影响经济发展和人民生活。
    进入１９８９年，这种紧张局面在一些地区不但没有得到缓和，反而有所加剧。据华东电网负责人说：今年缺电、缺煤有增无减。元月１—２０日缺煤停机日平均为７８．９万千瓦，元月１４日达１３５万千瓦。目前，徐州、陈壁、镇海、望城、石洞口等地电厂已经停机。举世瞩目的宝山钢铁总厂因焦煤供应紧张已面临停产的威胁，一台３５万千瓦机组因发电用煤供应不上，被迫停机。整个华东电网少发电３．８７亿千瓦。
    去年，我国原煤产量达到９．６亿吨，比１９８７年增产３２５０万吨；原油达到１．３７亿吨，比上年增产３００万吨；发电量为５３９０亿度，比上年多发电４００多亿度。人们不禁要问：既然去年煤超产、电超发、油超采，为什么能源尤其是电力供应出现“全国全面紧张呢”？
    经济过热是根本原因。这些年来，工业特别是加工工业、乡镇工业发展太快，能源生产的增长明显赶不上经济的增长。“六五”期间，工农业总产值增长６８％，一次能源只增长３４％，发电量增长３７％。“七五”前两年，工农业总产值年均增长１４％以上，而一次能源只增长３％左右，仅为“六五”的一半；发电量增长１０％，特别是发电设备与用电设备的比例严重失调，１９８６年为１∶２．５，１９８７年为１∶２．７９，现在接近１∶３。目前，煤、电最紧张的是华东、华南沿海地区。而去年这个地区除上海之外，工业增长速度都在３０％左右。如此过猛的经济增长速度，能源生产怎能跟得上？
    然而，经济过热不是一天出现的，能源生产供不应求，也早已开始，为什么从去年下半年以来这一矛盾表现得如此突出？据能源部负责人告诉记者：一个重要原因是，计划外用煤挤占了计划内发电用煤，许多大电厂的煤没有按计划给足。去年，全国四大电网计划内用煤到货率只有９２．６％，华东电网只有８６％，累计欠供发电用煤８００多万吨，影响了电厂发电。去年１０月，在国家计委召开的调度会上曾经确定，全国发电用煤冬储量不低于６００万吨。实际上，目前库存不到４００万吨，许多电厂今年存煤不但没有增加，反而继续下降。华东电网库存煤今年元月份比去年同期下降２９万吨。上海有的电厂存煤不到两天。东北电网供区内的五大水库去年严重枯水和超计划用电严重，一方面水位降低，水力发电不足；另一方面火电厂库存煤今年也在下降，元月１—１５日下降５万吨。
    能源紧张的局面给我们带来的教训是十分深刻的。它再一次告诫人们，能源工业上不去，其它工业也上不去。在安排国民经济中，一定要按照能源的生产能力，合理制定工农业增长速度，超过了能源生产的增长，经济过热，就必然受到客观规律的惩罚。在当前治理整顿中，各地对于那些耗能高又不急需的加工工业、对那些盲目发展而经济效益不高的乡镇企业，该调整的必须坚决调整，再也不能犹豫不决了。
    此外，计划外用煤挤了计划内用煤，是一条教训。为什么发电用煤没有按计划给足？据查，主要是某些单位和领导干部不顾整体利益，乱批条子，大挖电厂用煤。对于这种严重违法乱纪的行为有关部门正在追查，上百万吨发电用煤究竟到哪儿去了？一定要查它个水落石出。
