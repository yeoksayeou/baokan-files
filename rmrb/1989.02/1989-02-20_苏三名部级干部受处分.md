The Soviet Communist Party's Central Committee's Commission for Party Supervision has decided to issue warnings or serious warnings to three department-level officials in the Soviet Union who made serious errors or exhibited bureaucratic tendencies in their work. The officials are Forestry Industry Minister Buserkin, Deputy Minister Savchenko, and Deputy Chairman of the State Planning Committee Lukashov.

Today's issue of Pravda published this decision, which points out that the Forestry Industry Department last year supplied 15.3 million cubic meters less of various types of timber to the national economy than planned. Since 1986, the losses caused by this have amounted to 38 billion rubles.

The decision states that the reasons for the above problems are: the leaders of the Forestry Industry Department and its subordinate enterprises lack discipline in fulfilling state tasks, have not changed their bureaucratic and paper-pushing ways, have hardly expanded the production capacity of the timber processing sector, and have been slow to transition to new management methods.

　　苏三名部级干部受处分
    新华社莫斯科２月１８日电  苏共中央党监察委员会决定，分别给在工作中犯有严重错误或官僚主义作风的苏联森林工业部长布瑟金、副部长萨夫琴科和国家计委副主席卢卡绍夫以警告或严重警告处分。
    《真理报》今天公布的这项决定指出，森林工业部去年向国家经济部门少提供各类木材１５３０万立方米。自１９８６年以来，由此原因造成的损失已达３８０亿卢布。
    决定指出，造成上述问题的原因是：森林工业部及下属企业的领导人在完成国家任务方面缺乏纪律观念，没有改变官僚主义和文牍主义作风，几乎未扩大木材加工部门的生产能力，向新的经营方式过渡缓慢。
