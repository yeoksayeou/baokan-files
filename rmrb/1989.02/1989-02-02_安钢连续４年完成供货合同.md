Ansteel Maintains Economic Order, Completes Supply Contracts for Four Consecutive Years

    The People's Daily reports: The Anyang Iron and Steel Company in Henan Province has maintained economic order, ensured timely delivery without any shortfalls, and kept prices stable without any increases, achieving this for four consecutive years. In 1988, the company completed 3,847 supply contracts, earning praise from customers.

    To fulfill the contracts, the company did not hesitate to pay a high price. Last year, due to a delay in the delivery of 2,000 tons of pig iron, production and contract completion were affected. The company promptly took measures to purchase pig iron from the market at a negotiated price, overcoming the difficulties. In July, the "price increase trend" became more intense, but the company remained steadfast, honoring the contracts without raising prices by even a single cent, ensuring contract fulfillment.

　　安钢连续４年完成供货合同
    本报讯  河南安阳钢铁公司维护经济秩序，斤两不拖欠，分厘不涨价，连续４年如此，１９８８年完成３８４７份供货合同，受到用户好评。
    为兑现合同，公司不惜付出高代价。去年一度因２０００吨釸铁未按期到货，影响生产和供货合同完成，公司及时采取措施，面向市场购进议价釸铁，克服了困难。７月间，“涨价风”越刮越猛，公司不为金钱所动心，信守合同，一分钱不涨价，保证合同兑现。
