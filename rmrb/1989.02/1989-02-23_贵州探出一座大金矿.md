Guizhou recently discovered a large gold mine in Xingren County, located in the southwestern part of the province. This discovery marks the end of a period in which no large gold mines had been found in Guizhou.

In 1981, geologists in Guizhou began surveying for gold resources in counties such as Qinglong and Ceheng. In 1984, a significant gold deposit was found in Xingren County. Following this, geologists conducted a detailed three-year exploration of the site, confirming that the deposit's reserves exceeded the scale typically associated with large gold mines. The average thickness of the ore body is 4.99 meters, with an average grade of 5.52 grams per ton. Partial development last year yielded 1,500 taels of gold.

　　贵州探出一座大金矿
    新华社贵阳２月２２日电  贵州省最近在黔西南的兴仁县境内找到了一个大型金矿床。这一发现结束了贵州省过去没有找到大型金矿床的历史。
    １９８１年，贵州地质工作者就开始在晴隆、册亨等县普查黄金资源。１９８４年在兴仁县境内发现一个矿体厚、品位富的金矿点。接着，地质工作者又对这个金矿点进行了连续三年的详细勘查，探明这个金矿点实际控制的储量超过了大型黄金矿床应具有的规模。矿体的平均厚度为４．９９米，平均品位达５．５２克／吨，去年局部开发就生产黄金１５００两。
