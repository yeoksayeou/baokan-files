On a sweltering summer night, the Beijing Concert Hall hosted a unique three-stringed instrument (sanxian) concert titled "Love New Awakening Sanxian Score Music Concert." Eight sanxian instruments played in unison, performing "General's Order," vividly depicting a general marching onto the stage amidst cannon fire, inspecting his troops. Dramatically, the lead performer was not a professional sanxian player but the fifth-generation descendant of the Daoguang Emperor of the Qing Dynasty, and the great-grandson of Prince Gong Yixin, Aisin-Gioro Yuxiang.

Yuxiang was originally a freelance painter. As Mr. Pu Jie said, "My nephew Yuxiang is renowned for his Chinese painting." Since childhood, Yuxiang studied Chinese painting under the guidance of his uncle Pu Xinyu and his cousin Pu Songchang. Later, he enrolled in the Art Department of Beijing Normal University to study Western painting, but his initial passion for Chinese painting never wavered. His landscapes, figures, and floral paintings blend Eastern and Western styles, with strict composition and flexible brushwork. The famous Hong Kong figure Ho Ying-tung once purchased his painting "Zhong Kui Drunk" for 50,000 Hong Kong dollars.

Among the ancient sanxian melodies, there is the "Thirteen Suites of Strings and Bows," which are seasonal, one for each month, with an additional suite for the leap month, totaling thirteen. This set of melodies dates back to the Tang Dynasty and is nearly lost in modern times. According to Professor Cao Anhe of the Central Conservatory of Music, Yuxiang is the only person in the country who can play this set of melodies. To excavate the nearly lost ancient Chinese music culture, young teacher Tan Longjian of the Central Conservatory of Music went to great lengths to find Yuxiang. However, Yuxiang, who makes a living from painting, had long since stopped playing the sanxian. His sanxian was discarded during the "Destroy the Four Olds" campaign. Yuxiang was born 57 years ago in the back garden of the Prince Gong Mansion. Influenced by his family environment, he loved music, chess, calligraphy, and painting from a young age. At the age of seven, he often played with a broken sanxian as if it were a gun. His mother thought it was a waste to play with the instrument, so she had it repaired and strung, allowing Yuxiang to play with it. His first teacher was Lu Defu, a eunuch who served the sixth concubine of Prince Gong. Lu taught him the "Thirteen Suites of Strings and Bows" phrase by phrase. Later, he learned from Zhang Songshan, a blind performer who often came to his house to perform. Zhang said he had good fingers and was clever, so he was willing to teach him. At that time, there were no scores for playing the sanxian; it was all passed down orally. Yuxiang remembered it well. In a few years, he mastered the "Thirteen Suites." According to Yuxiang, there was no court orchestra in the mansion, unlike what is shown in movies, where flutes and pipes play during meals, and there is light singing and dancing. However, they often held "family music nights." His grandfather Zaixun played the flute, his father Puqi played the drums, his brother played the erhu, his sister played the pipa, and he played the sanxian. The family enjoyed playing together.

"The Music of the Prince Gong Mansion: Aisin-Gioro Yuxiang's Sanxian Score" is soon to be published by the People's Music Publishing House. Experts say that Yuxiang's discovery and performance of the sanxian suites showcase the living musical image of the sanxian performance art from the Ming and Qing dynasties, which is of great value for studying the development of Chinese national instrumental music.

　　绝响今日有知音
    ——爱新觉罗·毓峘和恭王府音乐
    夏珺
    去年夏天一个燥热的夜晚，北京音乐厅举办了一场别具一格的三弦音乐会——“爱新觉罗·毓峘三弦传谱音乐会”。舞台上八把三弦齐鸣，一曲《将军令》，用音乐语言再现了一位大将军在隆隆炮声中健步登上将台，检阅三军的壮阔场景。富有戏剧性的是，主奏者不是职业三弦乐手，而是清朝道光皇帝的第五世孙、恭亲王奕?的曾孙爱新觉罗·毓峘（见图）。
    毓峘本是个“个体户”画家，正如溥杰先生所说：“吾侄毓峘以国画名世”。毓峘从小就在伯父溥心畬和叔父溥松窗的指点下练习中国画，后考入北京师范大学工艺美术系学习西画，但他初衷难改，更爱国画。他画的山水人物花卉，熔中西于一炉，章法严谨，笔墨灵活。香港知名人士霍英东曾以五万港币买下他的《钟馗醉酒图》。
    三弦古曲中有《弦索十三套》大曲，是配合时令的，每月一曲，加一个闰月，故为十三。这套曲子唐代就有了，现代几乎失传。据中央音乐学院曹安和老先生讲，全国能弹奏这套曲子的非毓峘莫属。为了发掘濒于失传的中国古代音乐文化，中央音乐学院青年教师谈龙建费尽周折，终于找到了毓峘。可是以丹青为生的毓峘早就不摸弦了，家中的三弦“破四旧”时已被“扫地出门”。毓峘先生五十七年前生于恭王府后花园，受家庭环境熏陶，自幼喜爱琴棋书画。七岁时常拿一把破旧的三弦当枪耍。他母亲说这琴耍着玩怪可惜，便叫人安上轴、弦，修复一新，让毓峘弹着玩。他的启蒙老师是恭亲王六侧福晋的贴身太监罗德福，《弦索十三套》就是罗一句一句教他的。后来又跟常来家里演奏的“门先儿”（盲艺人）张松山学，张先生说他手指长得好，人也机灵，很愿意教他。那时弹弦也没谱子，全凭口传心授，倒也记得“磁实”。几年工夫，毓峘便熟练地掌握了“十三套曲”。据毓峘先生回忆，那时府里并没有什么宫廷乐队，不像电影里演的那样，吃饭时箫管齐鸣，轻歌曼舞。不过倒常开“家庭音乐会”，他爷爷载滢吹笛子，爸爸溥僡打鼓，哥哥拉二胡，姐姐弹琵琶，他弹三弦，一家人吹打弹拉，自得其乐。
    《清恭王府音乐爱新觉罗·毓峘三弦传谱》即将由人民音乐出版社出版。据行家说，毓峘先生三弦套曲的发掘和演奏，展现了明清以来三弦演奏艺术的活的音乐形象，对研究我国民族器乐艺术的发展很有价值。
