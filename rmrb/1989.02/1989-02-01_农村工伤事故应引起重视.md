Rural Workplace Injuries Should Be Taken Seriously

My hometown is in Zhidong Village, Xizhidong Township, Dingzhou City, Hebei Province. Every household in the village makes swords. Normally, it is either the sound of electric planers or flying grinding wheels. Due to insufficient attention to safety in production and poor labor protection conditions, workplace injuries frequently occur. On October 8, 1988, my 17-year-old son in my hometown had two fingers on his right hand cut off by an electric planer. In the past two years, this village has had over 130 serious injury accidents.

The main causes of these accidents are as follows: First, there is no one in charge of safety education and inspections, no safety production measures, and whoever gets injured is unlucky. Second, working conditions are poor, labor protection equipment is insufficient, and the quality of production equipment is substandard. Some equipment is defective or substandard, making accidents more likely. Third, there is reckless and hasty work without strict operating procedures. Fourth, people are eager to make money and do not pay attention to balancing work and rest, and accidents often occur when they are tired. These situations should be taken seriously by the relevant departments.

　　农村工伤事故应引起重视
    我老家在河北定州市只东乡西只东村，村里家家户户制作宝剑，平时不是电刨响，就是砂轮飞。由于人们对安全生产重视不够，劳动保护条件又差，工伤事故接连发生。１９８８年１０月８日，我在老家的１７岁儿子，右手被电刨切去两个手指。近两年，这个村已发生了１３０多次重伤事故。
    事故原因主要有：一、无人抓安全教育和安全检查，无安全生产措施，谁出事，谁倒霉。二、劳动条件差，劳动保护用品不足，生产设备质量差，有些是处理品、等外品，很容易出事故。三、胡干蛮干，求多求快，没有严格的操作规程。四、挣钱心切，不注意劳逸结合，发生事故多在疲劳时。以上情况应引起有关部门的重视。
