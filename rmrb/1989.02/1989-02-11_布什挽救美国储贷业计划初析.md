Bush's Plan to Save the U.S. Savings and Loan Industry: An Initial Analysis

Our reporter, Cang Lide

President Bush did not have a leisurely weekend. At the Camp David retreat in Maryland, he held repeated discussions with White House economic advisors and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan before announcing a comprehensive plan to address the crisis in the U.S. savings and loan institutions at the White House on February 6. This is the first major decision made by the Bush administration to tackle domestic financial issues since taking office.

The basic goal of this plan is to thoroughly overhaul the more than a thousand savings and loan institutions that have accumulated losses of up to $100 billion. The main measures include: the federal government will sell $500 billion in public bonds over three years to fund the liquidation of bankrupt savings and loan institutions; the principal of the bonds will be paid by the savings and loan industry, while the interest will be partially covered by the federal insurance fund, which comes from commercial banks and savings and loan institutions after increasing deposit insurance premiums, and the rest will come from taxpayers; restructuring the management of the savings and loan industry, strengthening supervision, and changing the previous situation where loans and deposit insurance were mixed; eliminating the phenomenon of losses in savings and loan institutions, and punishing illegal activities such as embezzlement and fraud in the industry.

Why did Bush decide to clean up the savings and loan institutions? An initial analysis reveals several reasons.

First, the U.S. savings and loan industry is in deep crisis.

The troubles in the savings and loan industry began in the late 1970s when interest rates soared. At that time, savings and loan institutions had to pay high interest rates to attract deposits, while the recovery rate of the 30-year fixed-rate housing loans they issued was very low, leading to a situation where income did not cover expenses. After Reagan took office, Congress allowed savings and loan institutions to expand into commercial real estate, oil, credit card, and other high-risk investments. However, by the mid-1980s, oil prices and land prices plummeted in many places, and a large number of savings and loan institutions were on the brink of collapse. Instead of repaying depositors' funds, savings and loan institutions invested in even riskier capital. As a result, losses increased from $15 billion to the current $100 billion in just a few years, and hundreds of savings and loan institutions declared bankruptcy. Now, there are 1,000 institutions on the verge of collapse or near collapse, with losses increasing at a rate of $1 billion per month, plunging the entire savings and loan industry into a serious crisis and becoming a "national problem." Bush believes that if the savings and loan crisis is not resolved and the entire savings insurance system is not fully restored, it will threaten the stability of the U.S. financial system.

While the savings and loan industry was expanding its investment scope, many managers deceived customers, misused funds, and engaged in corruption. The number of illegal cases surged from 434 in 1985 to 6,000 last year. However, the judicial department was short of funds and manpower, making it difficult to crack down, resulting in public outrage and congressional criticism. Therefore, the Bush administration plans to allocate an additional $50 million to the Justice Department to expand its staff and conduct nationwide investigations and punishments of illegal activities in the savings and loan industry. Offenders can be fined $100,000 per day or sentenced to more than 20 years in prison.

Second, the savings and loan crisis has exacerbated the federal budget deficit.

The U.S. has implemented a deposit insurance system since the 1930s, with the federal government responsible for protecting depositors' interests. The insurance fund comes from banks, savings and loan institutions, and savings and loan associations that collect deposits and pay deposit insurance premiums based on the amount of deposits. However, due to the severe losses of many savings and loan institutions in recent years, they have lost the ability to repay, forcing the federal government to intervene, thus increasing the government's financial burden. In the end, not only will the huge federal budget deficit be even harder to balance, but the liquidation funds will ultimately fall on the shoulders of taxpayers. In light of this, Bush plans to adopt measures such as selling bonds and increasing deposit insurance premiums to solve the savings and loan crisis while trying not to increase the overall government budget. Some people call this the "relatively balanced plan."

Third, depositors lack a sense of security.

The savings and loan crisis has made hundreds of thousands of American depositors anxious, deterring those who want to save money. The financial community generally believes that the recent decline in the U.S. savings rate directly threatens industrial investment, thereby affecting the long-term, stable growth of the U.S. economy. Bush originally wanted to use the method of increasing depositors' usage fees to raise the huge funds needed to rescue the savings and loan industry, but this immediately faced strong opposition from the financial community, depositors, and some congressional members. In this announced plan, Bush repeatedly assured the protection of depositors' interests, no increase in usage fees, and called on families and individuals to "for the bright future of the next generation" to deposit money with confidence.

After Bush proposed the plan to address the savings and loan crisis, it immediately received widespread praise from the leaders of both parties in Congress. A Democratic member of the House Financial Committee said that this plan is a "constructive and good start" for the Bush administration. Some savings and loan industry insiders took a neutral stance, neither praising nor opposing. The chairman of the National Savings and Loan League believed that the savings and loan industry would find it difficult to pay the increased deposit insurance premiums. The media commented that Bush's plan is "politically appropriate but fiscally flawed," and predicted that this plan would be passed after being amended by Congress and would not encounter much trouble.

　　布什挽救美国储贷业计划初析
    本报记者  仓立德
    布什总统的周末过得并不清闲。在马里兰州戴维营，他同白宫财政顾问及联邦储备委员会主席格林斯潘反复磋商后，于本月６日在白宫宣布了解决美国储蓄与贷款机构危机的综合计划。这是布什政府上台后着手解决国内金融难题的第一项重要决策。
    提出这项计划的基本目的是彻底整顿亏损额高达１０００亿美元的上千家储贷机构。主要措施是，联邦政府在３年内出售５００亿美元公债，作为清算破产储贷机构的经费；公债本金由储贷业支付，利息的一部分来自商业银行和储贷机构提高存款保险金后交纳的联邦保险基金，另一部分则出自纳税人；重组储贷业管理机构，加强监督，改变过去贷款与存款保险混杂的状况；杜绝储贷机构的亏损现象，惩处储贷业中营私舞弊、诈骗钱财等不法行为。
    布什为何决心清理储贷机构呢？初步分析有以下几个原因。
    一，美国储贷业危机重重。
    储贷业困境始于利率急剧升高的７０年代后期。当时，储贷机构一方面不得不支付高额利息以吸引存款，另一方面发放的３０年期固定利率的住房贷款回收率却很低，造成入不敷出的局面。里根执政后，国会允许储贷机构向商业性房地产业、石油业、信用卡业等扩展风险投资，但到８０年代中，许多地方油价和地皮价大跌，大批储贷机构濒临倒闭。储贷机构并未清偿储户存款，反而投注风险更大的资本。结果，亏损额在短短几年内便由１５０亿美元发展至目前的１０００亿美元，数百家储贷机构宣告破产。现在已有１０００家处于倒闭或接近倒闭的境地，亏损额以每月１０亿美元的速度增长，整个储贷业陷入严重危机，成为“全国性问题”。布什认为，不解除储贷业危机，“使整个储蓄保险制度完全康复”，将危及美国金融体系的稳定。
    在储贷业扩大投资范围的同时，许多管理人员欺骗客户，滥用资金，贪污腐化，各种违法案件由１９８５年的４３４宗猛升至去年的６０００宗。但司法部门却苦于资金、人手短绌，打击不力，致使民怨沸腾，国会指责。因此，布什政府计划向司法部增拨５０００万美元经费，责成其扩充人员，在全国范围调查、惩处储贷业的违法行为，案犯可被判处每日１００万美元罚金或２０年以上徒刑。
    二，储贷业危机使联邦预算赤字“雪上加霜”。
    美国自３０年代实行存款保险制，储户利益由联邦政府负责保障，保险基金来自吸收存款的银行、储贷机构、储蓄互助金按存款比例交纳的储蓄保险金。但是，由于近年来许多储贷机构亏损严重，失去偿还能力，联邦政府不得不出面干预，这就加重了政府的财政负担。到头来，不但庞大的联邦预算赤字更加难以平衡，而且清算经费最终将落在纳税者的头上。有鉴于此，布什打算采取出售公债、增收存款保险金等措施，既解决储贷业危机问题，又尽量不增加政府预算总额。有人称此为“相对平衡计划”。
    三，储户缺乏安全感。
    储贷业危机使成千上万美国储户人心惶惶，使想存钱的人望而却步。经济界普遍认为近年美国存款率的降低直接威胁到工业投资，从而影响美国经济的长期、稳定增长。布什原想用增收储户使用费的方法来筹措解救储贷业所需的巨额资金，但立刻遭到金融界、储户和一些国会议员的强烈反对。在这次宣布的计划中，布什一再保证维护储户利益，不增加使用费，并呼吁家庭与个人“为了下一代的光明前途”放心存款。
    布什提出解决储贷业危机的计划后，立即受到国会两党领袖的普遍赞许。众院金融委员会一位民主党议员说，这项计划是布什政府“具有建设性的良好开端”。一些储贷业人士则抱既不赞扬也不反对的态度。全国储蓄机构委员会主席认为，储贷业难以支付增加的存款保险金。舆论界评论说，布什的计划“政治上是妥当的，财政上则有漏洞”，并预料这一计划将经国会修正后通过，不会遇到多大麻烦。
