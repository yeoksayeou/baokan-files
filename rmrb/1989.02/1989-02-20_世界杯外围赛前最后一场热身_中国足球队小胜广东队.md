　　世界杯外围赛前最后一场热身    
    中国足球队小胜广东队
    本报广州２月１９日电  中国足球队今天下午在鹤山县进行世界杯外围赛前的最后一场热身赛中，以１∶０战胜广东队。
    在这场比赛中，国家队首先出场的队员是：守门员张惠康，后卫朱波、贾秀全、郭亿军、麦超，前卫高升、唐尧东、谢育新、段举，前锋王宝山、柳海光。这套阵容的进攻侧重于左路麦超、段举、王宝山这条线，右路则由朱波助攻下底传中，柳海光头球摆渡或谢育新插上抢点。除两边路进攻外，贾秀全、高升也轮番以中路反插，威胁广东队大门。战至２９分钟，国家队段举从左边发出角球至第一门柱，王宝山跑动斜插吸引出广东队中卫，柳海光跳起后仰把球顶向门前空档，反插上前的高升及时赶到以头球破网。这场比赛，国家队显得机动性较强。下半时张小文、吴群立和马林上阵后，改打４３３阵式，进攻速度有所加快。
