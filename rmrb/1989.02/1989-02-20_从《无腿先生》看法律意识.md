Title: Observing Legal Awareness Through "The Leatherstocking Man"

From the American film "The Leatherstocking Man," there is a scene that does not particularly stand out: a police officer asks a landlady about her tenant's situation. After the police officer shows his credentials, the landlady truthfully informs him, because it is a citizen's duty. However, when the police officer further requests to inspect the room, the landlady becomes less cooperative. One hears her casually asking, "Do you have a search warrant?" This near-instinctive question allows us to see from one angle what kind of legal awareness a citizen should have. With legal protection, the frail old woman is not afraid of the burly police officer.

In America and some other countries, there are many such examples. When their rights are infringed upon or are about to be infringed upon, they first think about how to use the law to protect themselves. For example, when their personal reputation is infringed upon, they do not first go to clarify the matter with someone, nor do they go to their superiors, and even less do they commit suicide. Instead, they find a lawyer and use the law to pursue the other party's responsibility and demand compensation for reputational damage. In people's minds, this is a matter of course; otherwise, it would be unthinkable.

Rights and obligations are the essence of the law. A citizen's legal awareness is reflected in their clear understanding of rights and obligations. Regarding obligations, they know how to fulfill them; regarding rights—those granted by the law—they do not allow others to infringe upon them illegally.

The national conditions of China and America are different, and the American style of litigation being prevalent is not necessarily a sign of a healthy legal system in our country. However, to a certain extent, whether one can consciously use the law to protect one's legal rights is more indicative of a citizen's legal awareness than whether one can consciously fulfill legally prescribed obligations. Currently, nationwide legal education activities have been fully launched in both urban and rural areas of our country. The practices of some regions and units have proven that to deepen this learning activity, in legal education, we must not only tell citizens what the law allows, requires, and how to do it, but also explain the various rights that the law grants to citizens. While clarifying citizens' obligations, we should emphasize explaining citizens' rights, so that they know how to use the law to protect themselves. This may be more helpful in enhancing citizens' enthusiasm for learning the law and improving citizens' legal awareness than simply instilling in citizens how to fulfill legally prescribed obligations.

### 从《无腿先生》看法律意识

　　从《无腿先生》看法律意识
    张永彬
    美国电影《无腿先生》里有这样一个并不引人注目的镜头：警察向一个老板娘了解其房客的情况，警察出示证件后，老板娘就如实相告，因为这是公民的义务；但当警察进而提出要看看房间时，老板娘就不那么好说话了，只听她轻松地问道：“有搜查证吗？”这近乎下意识地发问，使我们从一个侧面领略到了一个公民应该具有怎样的法律意识。有法律保护，龙钟的老太并不怕粗壮的警察。
    在美国和有些国家，这样的例子很多。当自己的权利受到侵犯或有可能遭受侵犯时，他们首先想到的是如何应用法律保护自己。比如当他（她）的人格名誉受到侵犯时，他们首先不会去找人澄清，也不会去找上司，更不会去自杀，而是找律师，通过法律追究对方责任，并要求赔偿名誉损失。在人们的观念里，这是理所当然的；否则，倒是不可思议的。
    权利和义务是法律的全部实质。公民的法律意识正表现在他们对权利和义务的清醒认识上。对义务，他们知道该如何去履行；对权利——法律所赋予的，则决不允许他人非法侵犯。
    中美两国国情不同，“美国式”的诉讼成风未必就是我国法制健全的标志。但是，从某种意义上说，能否自觉运用法律保护自己的合法权益，比能否自觉地履行法律规定的义务更能体现公民的法律意识。目前，全民普法教育活动已在我国城乡全面展开，一些地区和单位的实践证明，要把这一学习活动引向深入，在普法学习中决不能只向公民讲哪些是法律规定可以做、必须做和应该怎么做，而不讲法律赋予公民的各种权利。要在讲清公民义务的同时，注重讲明公民的权利，使之懂得如何运用法律保护自己，这比单纯地向公民灌输怎样履行法律规定的义务，或许更有助于提高公民学法的积极性，提高公民的法律意识。
