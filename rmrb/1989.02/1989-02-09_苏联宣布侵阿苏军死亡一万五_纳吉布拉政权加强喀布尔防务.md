	Soviet Union Announces 15,000 Soviet Soldiers Killed in Afghanistan
	Najibullah Regime Strengthens Kabul's Defense

	MOSCOW, Feb. 7 (Xinhua) — The head of the Middle East Department of the Soviet Foreign Ministry said on Feb. 7 that since last May, when the Soviet Union began withdrawing troops from Afghanistan, nearly 2,000 Soviet soldiers have been killed, bringing the total number of Soviet deaths in the nine-year war to 15,000.

	The latest figure on Soviet military deaths was first disclosed by Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze during his visit to Pakistan on Feb. 6.

	Last May, Soviet military leaders announced that a total of 13,310 Soviet soldiers had died in the Afghan battlefield.

	KABUL, Feb. 7 (Xinhua) — (Reporters Ma Guang and Ge Xiangwen) The Kabul government's Foreign Ministry said today that the Kabul government has mobilized and armed more than 30,000 members of the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan to defend Kabul after the complete withdrawal of Soviet troops.

	Foreign Ministry spokesman Muhammad Amany said at a press conference here today that the members of the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan include government officials, workers, drivers, and shopkeepers.

	The armed members of the People's Democratic Party are part of the military reserve, and they have undergone one month of training.

	In addition to these 30,000 people, 8,500 members of the People's Democratic Party have joined the military, 16,700 have joined the self-defense forces, 14,000 are serving in various military support roles, and 5,000 female party members have been assigned to military logistics work.

	Amany denied that martial law has been imposed in Kabul. He said that the military patrols the streets of Kabul at night and checks vehicles and suspicious individuals. He said that setting up checkpoints at major intersections in Kabul is necessary because the situation here is abnormal, and armed opposition members may infiltrate the capital.

    苏联宣布侵阿苏军死亡一万五
　　纳吉布拉政权加强喀布尔防务
    新华社莫斯科2月7日电　苏联外交部中东司司长7日说，自去年5月苏联开始从阿富汗撤军至今，又有近2000名苏军士兵在阿富汗被打死，这个数字使苏联在9年的侵阿战争中死亡人数上升到了1.5万人。
    最新苏军死亡总人数是由苏联外长谢瓦尔德纳泽6日在访问巴基斯坦时首先透露的。
    去年5月，苏军方领导人宣布共有13310 名苏军将士死在阿富汗战场。
    新华社喀布尔2月7日电　（记者马光、葛相文）阿富汗喀布尔政权外交部今天说，喀布尔政权已动员和武装了3万多名阿富汗人民民主党的党员，以便在苏联军队全部撤出之后保卫喀布尔。
    喀布尔政权外交部发言人穆罕默德·阿马尼今天在这里举行的记者招待会上说，阿富汗人民民主党党员包括政府机关和社会团体的职员、工人、司机和店员。
    武装起来的人民民主党党员称作军队的后备队，他们曾经受过一个月的训练。
    除了这3万人之外，还有8500名阿富汗人民民主党党员加入了军队，1.67万名加入了自卫队，1.4万名充当军队的各种服务队，5000名妇女党员披指派从事军队的后勤工作。
    阿马尼否认已在喀布尔实行军管。他说，军队夜间在喀布尔巡逻并盘查车辆和可疑的人。他说，在喀布尔主要街道路口设立检查站是必要的，因为这里的局势不正常，反对派武装人员可能潜入首都。
