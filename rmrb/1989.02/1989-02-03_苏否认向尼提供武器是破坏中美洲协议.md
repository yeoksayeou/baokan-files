The Soviet Union expresses deep concern over the tense situation in Central America and is prepared to cooperate in achieving peace in the region.

This was stated by Tedez Menjieshashvili, Secretary of the Soviet Union's Supreme Soviet Presidium, on February 1 during his visit to Caracas to attend the inauguration ceremony of Venezuela's new President Perez.

When asked by reporters if the Soviet Union's provision of weapons to Nicaragua could be seen as a violation of the Central American peace agreement, Menjieshashvili immediately denied it. He pointed out that the Central American peace agreement only prohibits the provision of weapons to irregular armed groups and does not prohibit the provision of weapons to legitimate governments. He added that the United States is also providing weapons to Honduras and El Salvador.

Menjieshashvili also expressed that the Soviet Union is prepared to contribute to the "just and peaceful resolution of the Central American crisis" in accordance with the principles stipulated in the Central American peace agreement.

　　苏否认向尼提供武器是破坏中美洲协议
    新华社加拉加斯２月１日电  苏联对中美洲存在的紧张局势深表忧虑，并准备为实现这一地区的和平提供合作。
    这是苏联苏维埃最高主席团秘书田吉兹·缅捷沙什维利１日在此间对新闻界讲的一番话。
    缅捷沙什维利是率团前来参加委内瑞拉新总统佩雷斯就职仪式的。当有记者问到苏联向尼加拉瓜提供武器，是否可被视为苏联破坏了中美洲和平协议时，缅捷沙什维利立即加以否定。他指出，中美洲和平协议中只规定禁止向非正规武装提供武器，并没有规定禁止向合法政府提供武器。他说，美国也在向洪都拉斯和萨尔瓦多提供武器。
    缅捷沙什维利还表示，苏联正准备按照中美洲和平协议规定的原则，为“公正、和平地解决中美洲危机”做出自己的贡献。
