A village enterprise in Wuyingliang sets up a barrier: students who do not graduate from junior high school are not eligible to work in the factory

    A report from our correspondent, Yang Zhenwu: For many years, Wuyingliang Village in Huailai County, Hebei Province, has not produced any high school graduates. Now, the village has a new requirement for its residents—those who do not graduate from junior high school are not eligible to work in the village's enterprises, and parents will be held responsible if their children drop out of school.

    Wuyingliang Village, with a population of less than a thousand, has a shoe factory that specializes in producing peasant shoes, providing employment for the village's surplus labor. In recent years, some farmers, seeing the success of the enterprise, have wanted their children who are still in school to start working early. Some students in school have also envied their peers who earn over 100 yuan a month, losing interest in studying. For a period, out of the 10 junior high school students in the village, 4 requested to drop out.

    Facing this trend of "more schooling is not as good as early work," Wuyingliang Village has set a rule: the village enterprise will not hire students who drop out, and only those who graduate from junior high school are eligible to work in the factory. Last year, when the factory's production tasks were tight, they recruited 30 people from nearby villages, but did not take in a single junior high school student from their own village who wanted to drop out and work. The village party branch secretary, Zhang Jingfang, said, "We cannot do anything that harms the next generation!"

    Wuyingliang Village's cultural qualification "barrier" has cut off the path for students to drop out and work in the factory, and also ensured the improvement of the quality of the new generation of farmers.

### 五营梁村办企业设起一道关卡  学生初中不毕业没有资格进厂

　　五营梁村办企业设起一道关卡    
    学生初中不毕业没有资格进厂
    本报讯  记者杨振武报道：多年不出高中毕业生的河北怀来县五营梁村对村民有了新要求——初中不毕业没有进村办企业做工的资格，小学生辍学要追究家长责任。
    不到千人的五营梁村有一个专门生产农民鞋的制鞋厂，容纳了全村的剩余劳力。近几年，一些农民看到企业办得很红火，就想让自己上学的孩子早点进厂挣钱。有的在校中学生也羡慕同龄人每月１００多元的收入，对读书失去兴趣。一段时间里，全村１０名在校初中生中，有４人要求退学。
    面对这种“多读书不如早做工”的思想倾向，五营梁村定下规矩：村办企业不收辍学学生，初中毕业才有进厂做工的资格。去年年底，厂里生产任务紧张，他们从附近村庄招收了３０多人进厂，硬是没收本村一名想辍学做工的初中生。村党支部书记张敬芳说：“耽误下一代的事，说什么也不能干！”
    五营梁村一道文化程度的“资格卡”，切断了在校学生辍学进厂的后路，也为新一代农民素质的提高提供了保证。
