Vietnamese official newspapers have rejected the recent proposal by the three factions of the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea to dissolve the Phnom Penh government as a means of politically resolving the Cambodian issue.

The official newspaper of the Vietnamese Communist Party, *Nhan Dan* (People), published an article today stating that the three factions' proposals for resolving the Cambodian issue are "unrealistic." The Vietnamese newspaper *Quan Doi Nhan Dan* (People's Army) also criticized the three factions for "insisting on the dissolution of the People's Republic of Kampuchea" (the Phnom Penh government backed by Hanoi). The newspaper further accused the three factions of "continuing to obstruct the political resolution of the Cambodian issue."

Observers here have noted that these statements from Vietnam were made just before the second informal meeting on the Cambodian issue in Jakarta.

Vietnam is currently conducting its first round of conscription for the year, but many young people are reluctant to join the military.

Today, *Quan Doi Nhan Dan* reported that the preparations for this round of conscription "lack enthusiasm," and even some grassroots cadres and the masses have asked, "The world and the situation in Southeast Asia are easing, but our country is impoverished. Why doesn't the state reduce the military but instead conscript young people?"

Lieutenant General Nguyen Thi, commander of the Ninth Military Region, told a reporter from this newspaper that such thoughts and doubts "exist throughout the country."

　　越南报纸拒绝解散金边政权     
   “国家穷得发颤，为何不裁军”——越南青年不愿当兵
    新华社河内２月１３日电  越南官方报纸拒绝了民柬联合政府三方最近为政治解决柬埔寨问题而提出的解散金边政权的建议。
    越南共产党机关报《人民报》今天发表文章说，民柬三方关于解决柬问题的主张是“不切实际”的。越南《人民军队报》昨天也指责民柬三方“一味要求解散柬埔寨人民共和国”（即河内扶植的金边政权）。这家报纸还攻击民柬三方“继续阻挠政治解决柬埔寨问题”。
    此间观察家们注意到，越南的这些言论是在第二次关于柬埔寨问题的雅加达非正式会晤即将举行前夕发表的。
    新华社河内２月１４日电　越南各省市目前正在开展今年第一期征兵运动，但许多青年不愿参军。
    越南《人民军队报》今天报道说，这次征兵的准备工作“看不到热烈的气氛”，甚至有许多基层干部和群众问道：“世界和东南亚地区的形势正趋向缓和，我国却正穷得发颤。为什么国家不裁减军队却征召青年入伍？”
    越南第九军区司令阮第中将对这家报纸记者说，这种想法和疑问“在全国普遍存在”。
