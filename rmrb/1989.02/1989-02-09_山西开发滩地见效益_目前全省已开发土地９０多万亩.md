	Shanxi Province has been vigorously developing and utilizing riverbanks and saline-alkali lands to boost agricultural production. To date, the province has developed over 900,000 mu of land.

	The Yellow River flows through the southwestern part of Shanxi Province, leaving behind several million mu of riverbanks. Additionally, some low-lying wetlands in the province have formed several million mu of saline-alkali wasteland. According to statistics from relevant departments, Shanxi has a total of 6.3 million mu of riverbanks and saline-alkali lands.

	These lands were often "flooded with water during rain and white and barren during drought" in the past. The development and utilization of these lands began about ten years ago. Various regions have primarily used the developed lands for aquaculture, planting, and economic and timber forests.

	Close to the Yellow River, the people of Yongji County, under the guidance of government departments, have divided and contracted the riverbanks in sections for fish farming. By the end of 1988, the county's fish production reached 1.7 million kilograms, accounting for one-quarter of the province's total fish production. The farmers of Nansu Village in this county have also created a high-yield "vertical farming" method. Farmers build pigsties on top of fish ponds, and chicken coops on top of the pigsties. They then use part of the fish feed to feed the chickens, whose droppings fall into the pigsties to feed the pigs, whose droppings fall into the fish ponds to feed the fish. As a result, chickens, pigs, and fish all have bountiful harvests.

	This year, various regions in Shanxi Province will strive to achieve agricultural abundance, and the development of lands will reach a new high. Currently, many counties and cities across the province have begun to formulate new plans for land development.

### 山西开发滩地见效益　目前全省已开发土地９０多万亩

　　山西开发滩地见效益
　　目前全省已开发土地９０多万亩
    新华社太原２月８日电  （记者杜文峰）山西省各地大力开发利用滩涂、盐碱地发展农业生产。到目前，全省已开发土地９０多万亩。
    依傍着山西省西南部流过的黄河，给山西留下了几百万亩滩涂。另外一些低凹下湿地，在山西省形成了几百万亩的盐碱荒地。有关部门统计，山西共有滩涂、盐碱地６３０万亩。
    这些土地，过去常常是“雨涝水汪汪，天旱白茫茫”。开发利用这些土地是从１０年前开始的。各地开发土地，主要用于发展养殖业、种植业和经济林、用材林等。
    紧靠黄河的永济县，农民们在政府部门指导下，分片承包了黄河滩涂，然后挖塘养鱼。１９８８年底，这个县鱼产量达１７０万公斤，占全省鱼产量的１／４。这个县的南苏村农民还创造出高效益的“立体养殖”法。农民们在鱼塘上建猪舍，猪舍上面建鸡舍。然后用喂鱼的部分饲料喂鸡，鸡屎拉在猪舍里喂猪，猪屎拉到鱼塘里喂鱼。结果，鸡、猪、鱼都获丰收。
    今年，山西省各地为了夺取农业丰收，开发土地将出现高潮。目前，全省不少县、市已着手制定开发土地的新规划。
