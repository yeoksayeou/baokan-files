The U.S.-EU "Beef War" Ceases, Both Sides Reach an Understanding Agreement

	People's Daily, Washington, February 19 - Reporter Zhang Qixun: U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter, Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter, and the European Community's high-ranking officials responsible for trade, Andersen, and the high-ranking official responsible for agriculture, McSharry, reached an understanding agreement on the beef trade issue in Washington yesterday. The European Community postponed its "retaliatory" sanctions against the United States, and both sides avoided escalating the trade conflict.

	The main content of the understanding agreement is that the European Community postponed its "retaliatory" sanctions against the United States. Both sides established a special high-level government group to draft specific measures within 75 days to facilitate the sale of hormone-free U.S. beef in Europe.

	On January 1, the European Community countries began implementing measures to ban the import of $100 million worth of hormone-containing U.S. beef. The United States responded with retaliatory measures, imposing a 100% tariff on the same value of certain agricultural products entering the U.S. market from the European Community, leading to the so-called "beef war" trade friction. Subsequently, the European Community decided to impose "retaliatory" sanctions on the United States, levying a 100% tariff on $100 million worth of U.S. nuts. The understanding agreement reached by both sides has temporarily halted this "beef war."

　　美欧“牛肉战”休战
    双方达成一项谅解协定
    本报华盛顿２月１９日电  记者张启昕报道：美国贸易代表希尔斯、农业部长尤特和欧洲共同体负责贸易的高级官员安德里逊、负责农业的高级官员麦克夏雷，昨天在华盛顿就牛肉贸易问题达成一项谅解协定，欧共体推迟对美国实行“反报复”制裁，双方避免扩大贸易冲突。
    谅解协定的主要内容是，欧共体推迟对美国实行“反报复”制裁，双方建立一个高级政府专门小组，在７５天内拟定具体办法，以便美国不含荷尔蒙的牛肉在欧洲销售。
    今年１月１日，欧共体国家开始实行禁止美国价值１亿美元含荷尔蒙的牛肉进口的措施，美国对此采取了报复措施，向欧共体进入美国市场同等价值的部分农产品征收１００％的关税，双方发生了被称为“牛肉战”的贸易摩擦。随后，欧共体决定对美国采取“反报复”制裁，征收美国１亿美元的干果１００％的关税。双方达成的这项谅解协定使这场“牛肉战”暂告中止。
