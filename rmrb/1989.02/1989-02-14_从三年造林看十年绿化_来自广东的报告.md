As tropical forests disappear from the Earth at a rate of 11 million hectares per year, and every minute sees 10 hectares of land swallowed by deserts, while voices around the world grow louder about the dangers of the "greenhouse effect" and receding coastlines, a piece of heartening news comes from China's Guangdong Province:

The decision to "eliminate barren hills in five years and green Guangdong in ten" has begun to show results: over the past three years, the province has planted 43 million mu of forests and fruit trees, with forest resources increasing by more than 13 million cubic meters annually.

		The lesson from the chaos

During the ten years of turmoil, while people used the phrase "soldiers look at Guangdong, even more lush and green" to express political fervor, the actual lush greenery was suffering from rampant logging. By 1979, the province's total forest consumption exceeded growth, resulting in a resource deficit of 3.6 million cubic meters.

Those who toyed with nature inevitably faced nature's retribution.

Xiuhua County is a microcosm of this. During the days of "steel-making everywhere," ancient trees were burned to produce piles of scrap metal. In the economic chaos of the Cultural Revolution, people resorted to selling timber from the mountains to make ends meet. Repeated logging enraged nature. By 1983, the county's forest coverage had dwindled to a mere 16%, with nearly 20,000 landslides, over a third of the area suffering from soil erosion, and over 600 million tons of soil lost annually.

In 1985, the provincial party secretary Lin Ruohua and the main agricultural officials spent over 120 days in the field. The provincial situation was clear: "Seven mountains, one water, two parts farmland." Only by enriching the vast mountain areas could Guangdong truly prosper and withstand various challenges. By the end of the year, the provincial party committee and government decided: eliminate barren hills in five years and green Guangdong in ten.

		The yellow card effect

Afforestation and greening are not short-term projects that yield immediate results. They require the sweat of millions, the wisdom of forestry experts, economists, and ecologists, as well as the foresight and decisiveness of politicians. Over three years, the provincial party committee and government held dozens of meetings on afforestation and greening, implementing numerous measures, with the most effective being the widely known "yellow card effect."

In March 1986, the provincial party committee and government decided to establish a system where the county party secretary, agricultural commission director, and forestry bureau chief each take responsibility for one afforestation and greening project. The provincial party secretary also took charge of Shunde County's Shui Nan and Huang Xi villages. Soon after, a system was implemented where county party secretaries are held accountable for afforestation targets during their term, with those failing to meet greening goals receiving "yellow card warnings" or resigning.

The orders were clear. The following year, the province organized a large-scale inspection, with 22 cities and counties receiving commendations, 6 county party secretaries receiving salary upgrades, and 5 counties receiving "yellow card warnings."

Zijin County, once producing 140,000 tons of pine resin annually and receiving a banner reading "Green mountains forever, pine resin flowing," had by 1984 become a county with vast barren hills, producing only 40,000 tons of pine resin. After signing a "military order," the county planted 340,000 mu of trees in one year, but still had 1 million mu of barren hills. The provincial party committee issued a "yellow card" to the county party secretary, warning Zijin County at a provincial mountain work conference. The choice was clear: either strive to catch up or resign. The county party secretary chose the former.

Upon receiving the "yellow card," the county party secretary immediately convened a meeting of the party and government leadership to summarize lessons learned, followed by a mobilization meeting for 1,500 officials to "eliminate 1 million mu of barren hills in one year." During the meeting, the deputy director of the county greening committee slipped away to drink. The county committee, upon receiving the report, immediately held a meeting to suspend the deputy director for reflection. People began to talk: this time, afforestation is for real!

The "yellow card" took effect level by level, with promises kept and actions followed through. Zijin County's "shame into war" strategy saw mountains sealed, forests protected, and 1 million mu of barren hills eliminated in one year, with a tree survival rate of over 95%. The greater achievement was the transformation of the officials' spirit and work style, which underwent effective cultivation and practical testing.

Under the "yellow card effect," mountain sealing, logging bans, and forest protection have been highly effective. Once spring arrives, the province's "Huaihai Campaign" for afforestation will be successfully completed, with 58 million mu of barren hills eliminated a year ahead of schedule.

		Green hope

Today's Guangdong is green everywhere. Afforestation and greening have become a public cause that everyone enthusiastically supports. Forestry and "three resources" enterprises are both key industries, with afforestation and fruit planting alongside deep processing projects. The majestic mountains of northern Guangdong are even greener. Industrial enterprise management experience is beginning to be applied to forestry operations, with three-dimensional planting and intensive management showing initial results.

In western Guangdong's Zengcheng mountain area, 610 million mu of trees have been planted in three years, developing from small gardens to commercial bases, creating famous products. Here, Deqing County's Gaoliang Town operates pine resin and cassia products, earning over $300 million in foreign exchange annually, with per capita earnings exceeding $100.

In the interaction between humans and nature, humans seem stingy, while nature is particularly generous. Experts point out that the value of forests in soil improvement and water conservation is six times higher than the combined value of forest timber, fuel, and fertilizer.

Xiuhua County, with about one-tenth of its area suffering from soil erosion, has seen 560 square kilometers of soil erosion treated in just three years of afforestation and fruit planting, increasing its forest coverage from 16.4% to 37.8%. Several rivers within the county have seen their riverbeds drop by 0.25 to 0.77 meters. During a once-in-a-century typhoon and heavy rainfall, most water conservation work remained intact.

In Guangdong's nearly 100 million mu of forests, birds and beasts that were once forced to migrate have returned to their homes.

From a good ecological environment, the greatest beneficiaries are humans.

　　从三年造林看十年绿化
    ——来自广东的报告
    蔡东士
    当热带森林以每年１１００万公顷的速度从地球上消失，全世界每分钟有１０公顷土地被沙漠吞噬，各国有识之士关于警惕“温室效应”和海岸线后退的呼声日高之时，在中国岭南，传来振奋人心的信息：
    “五年消灭荒山，十年绿化广东”的决策已见成效：近３年，全省造林种果４３００万亩，森林资源以每年１３００多万立方米的速度增长……
    　　　　洪荒启示
    十年动乱期间，当人们以“战士指看南粤，更加郁郁葱葱”来表达政治上的热烈气氛时，那真正的一派郁郁葱葱的树木却正在遭受乱砍滥伐的灾祸。到１９７９年，全省森林总消耗量超过生长量，资源赤字达３６０万立方米。
    戏弄大自然的人们当然受到了大自然的惩罚。
    五华县就是一个缩影。在“全民炼钢，处处高炉”的日子，不惜烧毁参天巨木换取一堆废铁。十年内乱，处于用鸡蛋换盐的经济状态下的人，想要钱就向山上的绿色银行伸手。一而再，再而三的砍伐，激怒了大自然。１９８３年，这里的森林覆盖率只剩下可怜的１６％，全县山地崩岗近２万处，１／３以上的面积出现水土流失，一年流失泥沙６００万吨以上。
    １９８５年，省委书记林若和分管农业的党政主要负责同志，分别在基层度过１２０多个日夜。省情很清楚：“七山一水两分田”，只有广大山区富裕起来，才称得上是内涵博大深厚的繁荣，才能使崛起的经济经受得起各种风浪的考验。当年底，省委、省政府决定：五年消灭荒山，十年绿化广东大地。
    　　　　黄牌效应
    造林绿化不是短期能见效的一朝一夕的工程，它除了需要千百万群众的汗水，林业专家、经济专家和生态学者的智慧外，更需要政治家的高瞻远瞩与果敢善断。三年时间，省委、省政府关于造林绿化的会议开了几十次，措施订了许多条，而最起作用的要数家喻户晓的“黄牌效应”。
    １９８６年３月，省委、省政府决定建立县委书记、农委主任、林业局长各抓一个造林绿化点的制度，省委书记也以从化县水南、黄溪村为点。不久，制定了县委书记任期内造林目标责任制，绿化工作不力者，受“黄牌警告”或引咎辞职。
    军令如山。第二年，全省组织力量大检查，２２个市县受表扬，６名县委书记受晋升一级工资的奖励，５个县被“提醒注意”——“黄牌警告”拿出来了。
    紫金县，曾经年产１．４万吨松脂，从北京扛回“青山常在，松脂长流”的锦旗。到１９８４年却成了荒山大户，年产松脂仅０．４万吨。立下“军令状”后，一年虽造林３４万亩，但仍有１００万亩荒山依旧荒芜。省委向这里的县委书记出示“黄牌”，在全省山区工作会议上对紫金县“提醒注意”。“警告”后面的选择是：要么奋起直追，要么引咎辞职。县委书记思想大为震动，他选择了前者。
    县委书记领了“黄牌”回县，立即召开党政领导班子会议总结教训，然后召开１５００人参加的三级干部大会，进行“一年消灭荒山百万亩”的总动员和部署。大会正在进行，县绿化委员会副主任溜到小街喝酒去了。县委接到报告，立即召开常务会决定让这位绿委副主任停职反省。人们议论开了：此番造林动真的啦！
    “黄牌”逐级生效，言必行，行必果。紫金“明耻教战”一年，封了山，管住林，一举消灭１００万亩荒山，树苗成活率在９５％以上。更大的收获，还在于干部精神面貌为之一振，工作作风受到一次有效的培育与实际的考验。
    在“黄牌效应”下，封山禁伐，护林防火都卓有成效。今春一过，全省造林的“淮海战役”就可胜利完成，５８００万亩荒山可提前一年全部消灭。
    　　　　绿色希望
    今日之广东，无处不飞绿。造林绿化已成全社会热心的公益事业。林业与“三资”企业同为优势产业，造林种果与深度加工项目并起。气势磅礴的粤北群山更加绿色莽苍。工业企业管理经验在这里已开始被运用于林业经营，立体种植，集约经营初见成效。
    粤西肇庆山区３年造林６１０万亩，从办山庄小园发展至建商品基地，创名优产品。这里德庆县的高良镇，经营松脂、桂皮等作物，一年创汇３００多万美元，人均创汇在１００美元以上。
    在人与大自然的交流中，人显得吝惜，大自然特别慷慨。专家指出，森林改土蓄水的价值，比森林的木材、燃料的肥料价值的总和高出６倍。
    水土流失面积约占全省１／１０的五华县，造林种果发展牧草仅三年，就有５６０平方公里的水土流失面积得到治理，全县森林覆盖率从１６．４％增加至３７．８％，境内几条河流河床下降０．２５米至０．７７米。在百年一遇的强台风大暴雨袭击下，大部分水保工作安然无恙。
    在广东近一亿亩的森林里，曾经被迫迁徙的飞禽走兽又返回故土……
    从良好生态环境中获得最大利益的是万物之灵——人类。
