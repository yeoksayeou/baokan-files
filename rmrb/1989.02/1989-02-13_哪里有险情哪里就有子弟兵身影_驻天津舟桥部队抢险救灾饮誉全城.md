	Where there is danger, there are soldiers: The Tianjin-based Boat Bridge Unit's disaster relief efforts win praise across the city

	BEIJING, Feb. 13 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing Military Region's Tianjin-based Boat Bridge Unit has been utilizing its "water advantage" to support Tianjin's construction and has been hailed as the "heroic water force." In early January, leaders from the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China highly praised the unit.

	The Tianjin-based Boat Bridge Unit contributes manpower and technology to Tianjin's flood control efforts every year. In 1988, the Haihe River's water level surged, causing difficulties for Tianjin's production and construction. The Boat Bridge Unit spared no effort, appearing wherever there were difficulties or dangers. During the autumn harvest season last year, over 6,000 mu of crops in the northern suburbs' Lixin Village were surrounded by floodwaters. The Boat Bridge Unit immediately dispatched soldiers with equipment to build a floating bridge on the Yongdingxin River, ensuring the smooth progress of the autumn harvest and planting.

	In August last year, a potential flood threat appeared upstream of the Xihe Sluice on the Ziya River. The Boat Bridge Unit mobilized nearly 200 soldiers to dredge over 10,000 cubic meters of debris, eliminating the threat. The unit has also repeatedly dispatched divers to assist the public security department in retrieving weapons, repairing water gates underwater, clearing urban sewage pipes, building bridges, and constructing water facilities on and under the water.

	Last year, the unit was named a model for military-civilian joint construction by the Tianjin Municipal Committee and the Tianjin Municipal People's Government for the third consecutive year.

　　哪里有险情哪里就有子弟兵身影    
    驻天津舟桥部队抢险救灾饮誉全城
    本报讯  北京军区驻天津舟桥部队利用“水上优势”，支援天津市建设，被誉为“英雄水师”。１月上旬，中共天津市委领导同志高度赞扬了这个部队。
    驻津舟桥部队，每年都为天津市的防汛工作贡献人力和技术。１９８８年海河水位猛涨，给天津人民的生产和建设带来不少困难。舟桥部队全力以赴，哪里有困难或危险，便出现在哪里。去年秋收季节，北郊李辛庄一带的６０００多亩庄稼被洪水围困，舟桥部队立即派出官兵，携带器材，在永定新河上架起一座浮桥，保证了秋收秋种正常进行。去年８月，子牙河西河闸上游出现汛情隐患，舟桥部队出动近２００名官兵，用了３天时间打捞出１００００多立方米柴草杂物，消除了隐患。这个部队还多次派出潜水员帮助公安部门打捞凶器，潜入深水抢修水闸，清除市区排污管道，抢架桥梁，建筑水上水中设施等。
    去年这个部队连续第３次被天津市委和市人民政府树为军民共建标兵。
