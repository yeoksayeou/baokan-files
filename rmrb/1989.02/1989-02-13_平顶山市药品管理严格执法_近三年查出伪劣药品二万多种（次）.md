Pingdingshan City strictly enforces the "Drug Administration Law," strengthening the supervision and management of drugs to ensure the safety and effectiveness of medications for the people.

In the past, Pingdingshan City lacked a systematic supervision and management system for drugs, and without legal regulations, the entire city's drug production, distribution, and hospital use were once quite chaotic, with counterfeit and substandard drugs frequently appearing. After the state issued the "Drug Administration Law," the city fully utilized legal weapons to investigate counterfeit and substandard drugs and crack down on the manufacture and sale of such illegal drugs. They combined surprise inspections with regular work, insisting on enforcing the law strictly and punishing lawbreakers. Over the past three years, the city has uncovered more than 20,000 cases of counterfeit and substandard drugs, handled more than 70 illegal cases, and punished a group of lawbreakers, effectively controlling the spread of counterfeit and substandard drugs.

At the same time, Pingdingshan City has changed the past situation in drug management where multiple parties intervened, each acting independently, setting up distribution points randomly, and issuing "qualification certificates" indiscriminately. They have established and improved regulations. According to the "Drug Administration Law" and relevant regulations, they have reissued production and distribution licenses for drugs, issued warnings to some unqualified entities, and ordered them to rectify their practices within a specified period. They have also legally shut down ten factories and stores that do not meet the conditions for producing and distributing drugs.

Currently, seven counties and districts in the city have established drug administration offices, appointed drug administration personnel, and set up eight drug inspection institutes, with a total of 93 drug administration and inspection personnel. Additionally, the city, county, township, and village levels have appointed 2,400 drug supervisors, inspectors, and reporters.

　　平顶山市药品管理严格执法   
    近三年查出伪劣药品二万多种（次）
    据新华社郑州２月１１日电  （记者赵平安）河南省平顶山市严格执行《药品管理法》，加强对药品的监督管理，保障人民群众用药安全有效。
    平顶山市过去由于对药品缺乏系统的监督管理体系，加上无法可依，致使全市从药品生产、经营到医院用药一度比较混乱，假劣药品屡禁不止。自国家颁布《药品管理法》以后，这个市充分运用法律武器，清查假劣药品，打击制售假劣药品等违法分子。他们把突击检查和经常性工作结合起来，坚持有法必依，违法必究。近３年来，全市先后查出假劣药品２万多种（次），查处违法案件７０余起，惩治了一批违法犯罪分子，使假劣药品得到了有效控制。
    同时，平顶山市改变过去在药品管理上存在的多方插手、各自为政、乱设经营网点、滥发“合格证”的现象，建立健全了规章制度。他们根据《药品管理法》和有关规定，重新核发了生产和经营药品的许可证，对部分不合格者采取“亮黄牌”警告，限期整顿，并且依法取缔了十家不具备生产、经营药品条件的厂店。
    目前，这个市已有７个县、区设立了药政股，配备了药政干部，成立了药检所８个，共有药政、药检人员９３名。同时市、县、乡、村四级还聘任了药品监督员、药品检查员、药情报告员，共２４００余名。
