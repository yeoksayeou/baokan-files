In early October 1988, I received a notice from the Beijing Library. The notice stated that the Beijing Library would be issuing new library cards in November. Readers would need to pay a deposit of 100 yuan for a new foreign language book library card and 20 yuan for a new Chinese language book library card.

The library is a cultural institution of the state, with the mission of promoting culture and serving society. For many years, the Beijing Library has been lending books without charge, and it has been highly regarded by readers from all over the country. However, starting this year, why does the Beijing Library require a significant deposit for issuing new library cards? We do not understand this policy. We hope that the Beijing Library can provide an explanation to readers nationwide.

### 发放借书证为何收押金？

　　发放借书证为何收押金？
    一九八八年十月初，我接到北京图书馆寄来的一份通知。通知中说北京图书馆将在十一月份更换借书证，读者领取一张新外文图书借书证，要交押金一百元；领一张新中文图书借书卡，交押金二十元。
    图书馆是国家的文化机构，它以宏扬文化，服务社会为宗旨。北京图书馆多年以来都是无偿借书，深受全国各地读者的欢迎。不知为什么从今年开始，北京图书馆发放借书证要收取为数不小的押金？对这一做法，我们十分不理解。希望北京图书馆向全国读者作些说明。
