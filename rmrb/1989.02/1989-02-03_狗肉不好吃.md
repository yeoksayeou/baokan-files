I am a Manchu, and thus I know that authentic Manchu people do not eat dog meat. It is said that a dog once saved Nurhaci's life, so the Manchus do not eat dog meat. But this is just a legend, and I think it is mostly untrue, because not only do the Manchus not eat dog meat, many other ethnic minorities also do not. Dogs are the totems of some ethnic minorities. One can imagine that in the primitive times, dogs were so important to nomadic tribes, and people had such deep feelings for them, how could they bear to eat them? However, I personally love to eat dog meat. I don't know if it was from learning from my Korean classmates in college or because there were many dog meat restaurants near the school. Compared to authentic Manchu people, I am undoubtedly a rebel.

So, I mention eating dog meat because I came to a small county in the Loess Plateau and found out that the people here also do not eat dog meat. At first, I even looked up the county annals and asked around to try to find some Manchu roots here, but I was disappointed. This place is in the Yellow River basin, and the people here are definitely not descendants of barbarian tribes. Why don't they eat dog meat? I asked the locals about this, and they said dog meat doesn't taste good, and no one has ever eaten it. I heard this and, with a dismissive air, started boasting about my experiences eating snakes, frogs, and rats, which left him astonished and speechless. Later, I don't know how, we started talking about eating fish. Since we hadn't eaten fish for a long time, I reminisced about various delicious fish. Just as I was lost in the delicious taste, a voice said:

"Fish doesn't taste good."

This time, it was my turn to be astonished and speechless.

"Fish smells bad and doesn't taste good."

Good heavens, the "fresh" in "fresh fish" is half about the fish itself.

We had a big argument, but in the end, neither of us could convince the other, and we parted ways unhappily.

Later, I went to the Yellow River to experience life, and a literature-loving local named Xiao Wang accompanied me. As I looked at the Yellow River water, I suddenly thought of fish, so I asked if there were fish here.

"There are plenty. When the Yellow River recedes, fish will be left on the riverbank. You can also take a stick and wait for the fish to surface, then hit it with a stick and kill it."

"Delicious!"

"That fish doesn't taste good."

My spirits immediately dropped. How could it not taste good? After asking for a long time, I finally found out that the problem was with the cooking method. People here catch fish and directly boil them in plain water, and some even boil them in millet porridge. I forgot to ask if they gutted the fish before boiling. How could the fish taste good like that?

I thought, the people here not eating dog meat and fish is not just a matter of habit, but also a matter of whether they know how to eat.

In winter, we bought a dog from the food supply company, added some seasoning, and stewed a delicious pot, specially inviting a few locals to taste it. After tasting, they all said it was delicious. Seeing this, I thought of their dietary structure. I originally knew that Shanxi is known for its noodles, but after coming to Shanxi, I found out that most people rarely eat vegetables. They don't eat noodles like Beijing people do with various small dishes, stir-fried sauce, and seasonings, but eat plain noodles with just vinegar, salt, and chili. Their idea is that the more noble the guest, the more plain noodles they should eat.

All this made me think of Guangzhou, where "anything with wings except airplanes is not eaten, and anything with legs except stools is not eaten," almost everything can be eaten. It seems that eating is indeed a matter of culture. Regions that developed early and have a higher level of civilization also have more diverse eating habits.

However, the important thing is not this, but the courage to break old ideas, the courage to try, and the willingness to learn and borrow. Therefore, I highly appreciate those few young men who dared to try dog meat.

Let's start with eating dog meat and fish.

### “狗肉不好吃”

　　“狗肉不好吃”
　　康洪伟
    我是满族人，从而知道了地道的满族人是不吃狗肉的。据说狗救过努尔哈赤的命，满族人才不吃狗肉。可这也仅仅是传说，我认为多半不可信，因为狗肉不仅满族人不吃，还有许多少数民族也不吃，狗是一些少数民族的图腾。可以想象，在蛮荒时代，狗这样的动物对于游猎民族有多么重要，人们对之有多深的感情，怎么舍得食之呢？可我却极喜欢吃狗肉，不知是上大学时向朝鲜同学学的，还是学校旁边狗肉馆多的缘故。同地道的满族人相比，我无疑是个叛逆。
    所以说起吃狗肉，是因为我来到黄土高原的一个小县城，得知这个县的人也不吃狗肉。开始时我还查县志，找人调查了解，企图在这里寻满族的根，可我失望了。这里地处黄河流域，这里的人绝非蛮夷之族的后代，为什么不吃狗肉呢？便向当地人提出这个问题，他说狗肉不好吃，从来就没有人吃。我听了这话，不以为然地神吹起我的吃蛇吃蛙吃老鼠的经历，把他惊讶得目瞪口呆。后来不知怎么就说到了吃鱼上，因为好久我们没有吃过鱼，于是我陶醉地回忆起各种各样好吃的鱼来。正当沉湎于鲜美的味道时，一个声音说：
    “鱼肉不好吃。”
    这回轮到我目瞪口呆了。
    “鱼肉臭，不好吃。”
    上帝，那鲜美的“鲜”字就有一半是鱼。
    我们大大地争论了一番，终于谁也没有说服谁，不欢而散。
    后来我到黄河边深入生活，那个镇上爱好文学的小王陪着我，我望着黄河水突然想到了鱼，就问这里有鱼吗？
    “有，多的是。到黄河退水时，河滩上就能留下鱼，你也可以拿根木棒等着，看鱼在水里露头，一棒子下去就能打死一条。”“美味呵。”“那鱼不好吃。”
    我的情绪一下子下来了，怎么不好吃？问了半天才知道，问题在吃法上。此地人弄到鱼，直接把鱼放在白开水里煮，有的还放在小米粥里煮。我忘了问他将鱼拿去煮时是否把肚子剖开了。这鱼怎么会好吃？！
    我想，这里人不吃狗肉和鱼，不仅是囿于一种积习，还有个是否会吃的问题。
    冬天时我们从食品公司买了条狗，配以佐料，炖了美美的一锅，专门请了几个当地人来尝尝。他们品罢竟连声说好吃。看到这情景我又想到了他们的饮食结构。我原先知道，山西以面食为主，到了山西后又知道了一般人很少吃蔬菜，吃面条也不像北京人吃炸酱面那样佐以许多小菜、炸酱和调味品，而是吃净面，仅佐上醋、盐和辣子。他们的观念是，越是招待高贵的客人，越是要吃净面。
    这一切又使我想到了那个“有翅膀的除了飞机不吃，有腿的除了板凳不吃”几乎什么都可吃的广州。看来吃也确是文化。开发早的地区，文明程度较高的地区，吃的也多种多样。
    然而重要的不是这些，重要的是敢于打破旧的观念，敢于尝试，勇于学习和借鉴。所以，我很赞赏那几个敢于尝尝狗肉的小伙子。
    就从吃狗肉和鱼开始吧。
