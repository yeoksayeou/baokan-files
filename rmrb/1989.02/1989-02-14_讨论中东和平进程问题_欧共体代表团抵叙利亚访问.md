The European Community delegation arrived in Syria on the evening of February 12th after a brief visit to Egypt. They are preparing to discuss the progress of Middle East peace with Syrian officials.

During their visit to Egypt, the delegation leader, Spanish Foreign Minister Fernando Morán, held a press conference in Cairo on February 12th. He stated that the best way to bring peace to the Middle East is to convene an international peace conference as soon as possible.

He said that it is time for the conflicting parties to come together to resolve the Middle East crisis. He noted that the Palestine Liberation Organization, the United States, and Israel have shown positive changes in their attitudes towards resolving the long-standing conflict. He expressed that the European Community will do everything in its power to persuade Israel to participate in the international peace conference.

He mentioned that the European Community's visit to the Middle East is to assess the situation in the region and prepare a report for the European Community Foreign Ministers' meeting scheduled for February 14th in Madrid. The meeting will discuss how to promote the Middle East peace process.

According to reports, Morán had visited Israel last month and held talks with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and other officials. However, he did not succeed in persuading Israel to agree to hold an international peace conference or to recognize the PLO as a main party to the negotiations.

On February 12th, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak (left) met with visiting French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas (right) and other European Community representatives in Cairo. Both sides held talks on the Middle East peace issue.

　　讨论中东和平进程问题   
    欧共体代表团抵叙利亚访问
    新华社北京２月１３日电  综合本社驻开罗和大马士革记者的报道，欧洲共同体代表团在结束了对埃及的短暂访问后，１２日晚上到达大马士革，准备同叙利亚官员讨论中东和平进展问题。
    在埃及访问期间，欧洲共同体代表团团长、西班牙外交大臣费尔南德斯１２日在开罗举行的记者招待会上说，尽早召开中东和平国际会议是给中东地区带来和平最好的办法。
    他说，现在是使冲突各方走到一起来解决中东危机的时刻。因为，巴勒斯坦解放组织、美国和以色列对解决长期存在的冲突的态度已经有了积极的变化。他表示，欧洲共同体将尽一切努力，说服以色列参加中东和平国际会议。
    他说，欧洲共同体出访中东是为了估价这个地区的形势，准备向１４日在马德里举行的欧洲共同体外长会议上提出报告，讨论如何促进中东和平进程问题。
    据报道，费尔南德斯上月曾访问了以色列，并同以色列总理沙米尔等官员举行了会谈。但是，他没有说服以色列同意举行中东和平国际会议和承认巴解组织作为主要一方参加谈判。（附图片）
