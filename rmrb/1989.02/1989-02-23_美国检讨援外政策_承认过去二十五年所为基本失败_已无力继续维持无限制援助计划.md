The United States Reviews Its Foreign Aid Policy
Acknowledges Basic Failure of Past 25 Years
Unable to Sustain Unrestricted Aid Programs

WASHINGTON, Feb. 21 (Xinhua) — The U.S. Agency for International Development today released a report stating that over the past 25 years, the United States has spent billions of dollars on economic aid programs to help Third World countries escape poverty, but these efforts have largely failed. The report also calls for a "fundamental change" in future official aid programs to address new realities.

The report, titled "Development and National Interest: U.S. Economic Aid Toward the 21st Century," says that since the 1950s, only a few countries that have received U.S. aid have managed to break free from dependency. Economic growth in these countries was mainly due to their own correct policies, with U.S. aid playing only a "secondary role."

The report states that the United States no longer possesses the unchallenged economic and military dominance it had in the 1960s and is therefore unable to continue with unrestricted aid programs as in the past.

The report was released as the U.S. Congress and the Bush administration began debating the reduction of $15.1 billion in foreign aid. According to statistics from the House Foreign Affairs Committee, among the 10 major countries receiving U.S. aid from 1977 to 1989, Israel ranked first with approximately $45 billion in aid, followed by Egypt with about $32 billion. The others in descending order are Turkey, Pakistan, Greece, El Salvador, the Philippines, Spain, India, and South Korea, which received approximately $3 billion.

　　美国检讨援外政策
    承认过去二十五年所为基本失败     
    已无力继续维持无限制援助计划
    本报华盛顿２月２１日电  记者仓立德报道：美国国际开发署今天发表报告称，在过去２５年中，美国花费上千亿美元帮助第三世界国家摆脱贫困的经济援助计划基本上是失败的。报告同时要求“从根本上改变未来的官方援助计划，以面对新的现实”。
    这份题为《发展与国家利益：迈向２１世纪的美国经援》的报告说，从５０年代起一直接受美援的国家中，只有个别国家摆脱了依赖状态。经济增长主要是那些国家选择了正确政策的结果，美援只起了“次要作用”。
    报告说，美国现已不具备它在６０年代那种不受挑战的经济、军事突出地位，因此无力继续维持以前那样没有限制的援助计划。
    这份报告是在美国国会和布什政府如何就削减１５１亿美元对外援助开始辩论之际发表的。据众院外委会统计，在１９７７—１９８９年接受美援的１０个主要国家中，以色列名列第一，受援额约达４５０亿美元，其次为埃及，约为３２０亿美元。其后依次为土耳其、巴基斯坦、希腊、萨尔瓦多、菲律宾、西班牙、印度，南朝鲜名列最后，约为３０亿美元。
