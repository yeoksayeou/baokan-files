Negotiations between Norway and the Soviet Union over the demarcation of the Barents Sea have been stalled for over two years, but recently both sides have shown a willingness to resume talks.

According to sources, the Soviet Union sent a letter to Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland just before Christmas last year. The message in the letter surprised the Norwegians: Moscow, for the first time, indicated that it might consider abandoning its long-held "sector principle" in the division of the Barents Sea continental shelf.

In this context, the Norwegian government hopes to resolve the nearly twenty-year-old border dispute in the Barents Sea through high-level dialogue and expert consultations. Norwegian diplomatic sources noted that the Soviet Union and Sweden had successfully resolved their border dispute in the Baltic Sea through direct and active political negotiations.

The disagreement between Norway and the Soviet Union over the demarcation of the Barents Sea continental shelf has been long-standing. Since 1974, the two sides have held nine rounds of negotiations, but without any results. Norway advocates the "median line principle" for demarcation, while the Soviet Union insists on the so-called "sector principle," thus creating a disputed area of 155,000 square kilometers. According to reports, the disputed area is rich in fisheries and may contain large amounts of oil and natural gas. More importantly, this region is strategically significant. The Soviet Union has a large military base around Murmansk on the Barents Sea coast, and the disputed area is a crucial passage for the Soviet Northern Fleet to enter and exit the North Atlantic, making the issue even more complex. To resolve the fishing dispute, the two countries reached a temporary arrangement, demarcating a 67,000 square kilometer "gray area" of undetermined ownership.

Norway had hoped that after the Soviet Union resolved its border dispute with Sweden in the Baltic Sea last year, it would also take a stance to advance the stalled Norway-Soviet Union Barents Sea border negotiations. However, during Soviet Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov's visit to Norway, he did not show a willingness to demarcate the border but instead proposed establishing a "zone of trust and cooperation" to jointly develop and utilize potential oil and gas resources in the Barents Sea. Norway, being a small country, naturally has reservations about establishing such a "cooperation zone" with a superpower without clear borders, and thus clearly rejected the proposal.

According to reports, in the letter to Brundtland, the Soviet side expressed that it could consider abandoning its "sector principle" demarcation method, while still advocating for a "zone of trust and cooperation" in the Barents Sea between the Soviet Union and Norway. The Norwegian government views the Soviet letter as a symbol of the Soviet Union's willingness to compromise. Therefore, the Norwegian government is willing to invite the Soviet Union to engage in new negotiations to explore the extent of possible concessions by the Soviet Union.

It is now clear that Brundtland will visit Moscow in June, and the defense and foreign ministers will also visit the Soviet Union separately.

It is estimated that the border dispute between the two countries over the Barents Sea may ease through the aforementioned visits.

### 挪威苏联巴伦支海划界问题新动向

　　挪威苏联巴伦支海划界问题新动向
    新华社记者  许福瑞
    挪威和苏联关于巴伦支海划界问题的谈判中断两年多之后，双方最近又都表现出恢复会谈的愿望。
    据此间人士透露，苏联去年圣诞节前夕曾向挪威首相布伦特兰夫人致信，信中发出的信息使挪威人感到惊讶：莫斯科第一次表示，在划分巴伦支海大陆架问题上，苏可考虑放弃其过去一贯坚持的所谓“扇形原则”。
    在此情况下，挪威政府希望通过高级领导人的对话和专家的具体会谈，尽快解决持续近二十年的巴伦支海划界纠纷。挪威外交部人士注意到，苏联和瑞典就是通过直接和积极的政治会谈，使双方关于波罗的海划界问题的纠纷得以解决的。
    挪苏关于如何划分巴伦支海大陆架问题的分歧由来已久。一九七四年以来双方先后进行过九轮谈判，但无任何结果。挪威主张以“中间线原则”划界，苏联则主张以所谓“扇形原则”划分，这样便形成一个面积达十五点五万平方公里的争议区。据报道，争议区渔业资源丰富，并可能蕴藏大量石油和天然气。更重要的是，这一地区战略意义重大，苏联在巴伦支海沿岸的摩尔曼斯克周围拥有庞大的军事基地，争议区也是苏联北方舰队出入北大西洋的必经之地，这自然使问题更加复杂化。为了解决捕鱼争端，两国达成了一种临时安排，即划定了一块归属未定、面积为六点七万平方公里的所谓“灰色区域”。
    挪威方面本来希望，一年前苏联在同瑞典解决了波罗的海划界问题后，也能作出姿态，使长期陷入僵局的挪苏巴伦支海划界谈判有所进展。但苏联部长会议主席雷日科夫随后访问挪威时，没有表现出划定边界的意愿，却建议苏挪建立一个“信任与合作区”，以共同开发和利用巴伦支海可能存在的石油和天然气资源。挪威是一个小国，它与一个超级大国建立这种边界未定的“合作区”自然心存疑虑，因此明确拒绝了这一建议。
    据报道，苏联方面在致布伦特兰夫人的信中，一方面表示可以考虑放弃其“扇形原则”划界方法，另一方面仍主张苏挪在巴伦支海建立“信任与合作区”。挪威政府把苏联的信件看作是苏联妥协愿望，具有象征意义。因此，挪威政府愿意邀请苏联进行新的谈判，以试探苏联可能做出让步的程度。
    现在已经比较明确的是，布伦特兰夫人将于六月份访问莫斯科，国防大臣和外交大臣也将分别访苏。
    据估计，两国关于巴伦支海划界问题的争端通过上述访问可能出现缓解。
