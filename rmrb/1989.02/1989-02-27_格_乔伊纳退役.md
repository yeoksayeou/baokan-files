Florence Griffith-Joyner Retires

According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 26. The three-time gold medalist at the Seoul Olympics, world record holder in the women's 100 meters and 200 meters, and 29-year-old famous American track and field athlete Florence Griffith-Joyner announced in tears at a press conference held in New York on the 25th that she is retiring from the track and field events she loves so much. She will instead focus on film and television, writing books, and serving as a coach for her husband Al Joyner.

Florence Griffith-Joyner said that after the Olympics, many people from the business and arts worlds invited her, and the numerous social engagements made it unrealistic for her to continue training and competing while pursuing new interests.

　　格·乔伊纳退役
    据新华社北京２月２６日电  汉城奥运会三枚金牌得主、女子１００米、２００米世界纪录保持者、２９岁的美国著名田径运动员格·乔伊纳２５日在纽约举行的记者招待会上含泪宣布，退出她全身心热爱的田径比赛，改行从事影视和著书工作，并担任她丈夫阿·乔伊纳的教练员。格·乔伊纳说，奥运会之后，商界、艺术界不少人纷纷相邀，众多的应酬活动使她感到既要继续训练、参赛又要追求新的兴趣所在是不现实的。
