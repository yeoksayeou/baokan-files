French Culture Minister Jacques Lang announced in Paris today that France will soon establish a club for investing in epic films, aiming to produce ten epic films annually to revitalize the French film industry.

Lang pointed out at a press conference that the French film industry generally believes that producing "epic films with grand themes and rich imagery" is an "indispensable means" to regain movie audiences. He said the purpose of establishing the epic film investment club is to "strengthen the financial autonomy of film production." The club will be composed of companies and enterprises outside the film and television industry. The state will provide a guarantee fund of 30 million francs annually for the club, covering 50% to 70% of the investment risk.

The average budget for shooting epic films in France is over 50 million francs. Despite the downturn in the film industry, three films produced last year achieved unexpected success. "The Bear," "The Big Blue," and "Life is a Long Quiet River" each attracted over 1.3 million viewers and earned more than 70 million francs in revenue in Paris alone during their first run.

　　振兴法国电影事业
　　法将成立电影巨片投资俱乐部
    新华社巴黎二月七日电　（记者吴葆璋）法国文化部长雅克·兰今天在巴黎宣布：法国即将成立一个电影巨片投资俱乐部，每年生产十部巨片，以振兴法国的电影事业。
    雅克·兰在记者招待会上指出，法国电影界普遍认为，摄制“主题宏大、形象丰富多彩”的巨片是重新赢得电影观众的“不可缺少的手段”。他说，成立巨片投资俱乐部的目的在于“加强电影生产的财政自治”。巨片俱乐部将由影视界以外的公司和企业组成，国家每年为俱乐部提供三千万法郎的保证基金，承担百分之五十至百分之七十的投资风险。
    法国拍摄电影巨片的平均预算为五千万法郎以上。在电影业萧条的情况下，去年法国摄制的三部影片取得出人意料的成功，《熊》、《蓝色大世界》和《生活是一条静静的长河》第一轮上演时，仅在巴黎便分别赢得了一百三十万以上的观众和七千万法郎以上的收入。
