Since last November, tens of thousands of Taiwanese residents have come to the mainland to visit relatives and friends, which often makes me think of Mr. Tai Jingnong: could he also come back to take a look?

It has been over 40 years since I last saw Mr. Tai. The last time I saw him was in 1946. That summer and early autumn, I heard that he had come from Baisha to Chongqing, so I went with Mr. Sun Fuyuan to visit him. He was living in the home of a relative in the lower part of the city on Lin Sen Road, in a fairly large courtyard. As we walked into the courtyard, we met a young woman who looked like a student, so we asked her where Mr. Tai lived. She enthusiastically led us there, and it seemed she was quite familiar with Mr. Tai. Mr. Sun asked her, "Are you Mr. Tai's daughter?" She smiled and said, "No, I am Mr. Tai's student." This made us all laugh. Mr. Tai was pleasantly surprised by our visit. He told us that he had accepted a position at Taiwan University and was waiting in Chongqing to take a ship to Shanghai and then to Taiwan. He and Mr. Sun talked about old friends they had known in Beijing, and he also told us about some of Mr. Xu Shouchang's situation after going to Taiwan. Before this, Mr. Tai had tried to help me find a teaching position, and this time he explained the reasons for the failure and eagerly asked about my work at the time. His relative's home was quite crowded, and he was temporarily staying there, seemingly in a hurry. We talked for about an hour and then left. Mr. Tai escorted us to the courtyard gate and we bid each other farewell. Little did we know that this would be the last time we saw each other for over 40 years!

Mr. Tai was a member of the Unnamed Society and a famous writer and calligrapher. Among the members of the Unnamed Society, many were engaged in translation, but only Mr. Tai specialized in novel creation. In the 1920s, he published the short story collections "Children of the Earth" and "The Tower Builders," which were included in the "Unnamed New Series" edited by Lu Xun. The former drew heavily from folk materials, "bringing the life and death of the countryside and the smell of the earth to paper" (Lu Xun's words); the latter praised the "prophets of the times" who "dedicate their sincerity and blood to a single belief" (from the postscript of the book). These two characteristics were rare in the literary world at that time. In addition to novels, Mr. Tai also studied classical literature and published articles such as "Northern Song Dynasty Poets" in the "Chinese Literature Research Special Issue" of "Novel Monthly" at an early date. His article "Mr. Lu Xun's Achievements in Editing Chinese Classical Literature" is one of the earlier famous works on Lu Xun's editing of ancient books.

I once collected Lu Xun's unpublished works and wrote to Mr. Tai for guidance. He neatly copied out a piece by Lu Xun titled "Preface to Xie Cheng's 'Book of the Later Han'" with a brush, noting at the end: "Mr. Lu Xun compiled Xie Cheng's 'Book of the Later Han,' but it was not included in the 'Complete Works'; this preface was copied and sent to Tai Jingnong by Mrs. Jing Song in 1928." At the beginning of the liberation, I handed this preface to the "Mass Literature" monthly in Chongqing for publication, and later it was included in the "Supplementary Edition of Lu Xun's Complete Works" by Comrade Tang Dang.

Mr. Tai and Mr. Lu Xun had a deep friendship, which can be seen from the more than 40 letters Lu Xun wrote to him, which were candid and free. I once hoped he could write a memoir about Lu Xun, but he replied: "I have the intention to write a memoir for Teacher Yu, but I am busy with life, and my memories are not complete, so I have not been able to start writing." At that time, the life of a professor was very hard, and it was difficult to find time to write, so Mr. Tai's memoir about Lu Xun was not completed, which is really a pity.

Mr. Tai was always engaged in educational work and had taught at Beijing Fu Ren University and Xiamen University. During the War of Resistance, he moved to Sichuan to avoid the enemy and taught at the National Women's Normal College. This college was located in Baisha Town on the south bank of the Yangtze River in Jiangjin, and the environment was very quiet. I once went to Baisha and visited him at the college. Without any introduction, I felt no stranger when we met. I remember that on the mud wall of his study, there was a long scroll of old-style poetry by Lu Xun written by him. He taught at this college for several years and was very popular with the students. But by 1946, he could no longer stay. After the victory of the War of Resistance, the college faced relocation issues and was in turmoil. The Ministry of Education of the Kuomintang arbitrarily ordered the dissolution of the college, set up a so-called "Rectification Committee," and ordered students to re-register, expelling those who did not comply, and also dismissed a group of teachers. Finally, the college was forcibly moved from Baisha to Huangjueping in Chongqing. In this turmoil, Mr. Tai, in protest against the Ministry of Education's unreasonable measures, resolutely resigned from his professorship to show his protest. In a letter he wrote to me in May 1946, he said: "I have voluntarily retired in protest against the Ministry of Education's improper handling. I plan to stay in Baisha for the time being and then decide on my next move. If I do not go east, I will go to Chengdu. As for my current living situation, I can still support myself for a while by selling clothes (which I have to sell anyway), and friends also provide assistance." In another letter in July of the same year, he said: "Today, the struggle between educational factions is everywhere. The turmoil at the college this time, I can only watch and retire, recalling the past events of the Women's Normal College, I can only feel ashamed, but the arrogance of those in charge of education is indeed greater than that of the past beasts." He also told me: "I have accepted a professorship at Taiwan University... but currently, transportation and travel expenses are all uncertain, and I can only wait for friends to help arrange it."

Since Mr. Tai went to Taiwan, there has been no news for a long time. Only in recent years have I occasionally heard some scattered news about him, knowing that he has retired from Taiwan University, once went to the United States for a short visit at the invitation of a friend, and also knowing that he recently published a book "Dragon Ridge Miscellaneous Writings," which is a collection of his various small essays written over the past 40 years. In the mainland, the People's Literature Publishing House reprinted "Children of the Earth" and "The Tower Builders" in 1984; the "Chinese Calligraphy" magazine, sponsored by the Chinese Calligraphers Association, published a special issue to introduce Mr. Tai's calligraphy art. In such an atmosphere, one often remembers Mr. Tai. Looking south to the clouds in the sky, how can one stop thinking of him! Can he come north for a visit?

　　怀台静农
    林辰
    自从前年１１月以来，已有盈千累万的台湾居民前来大陆探亲访旧，这使我常常想起台静农先生：他能不能也回来看一看呢？
    不见台先生已有４０多年了。和他最后一次相见，是在１９４６年。那年夏末秋初，听说他已由白沙来到重庆，我便和孙伏园先生去看他。他住在下半城林森路的亲戚家里，是一个相当大的院落。我们走进院子，遇见一个学生模样的女青年，便向她打听台先生住在哪里。她热情地主动带我们前去，看样子和台先生很熟。孙先生便问她：“你是台先生的女儿吧？”她笑着说：“不是，我是台先生的学生。”引得我们都笑了。台先生对于我们的来访，感到意外的高兴。他告诉我们，他已接受台湾大学的聘请，正在重庆候船去上海转往台湾。他和孙先生谈了过去在北平相熟的旧友们的消息，又告诉我们许寿裳到台湾以后的一些情况。在此以前，台先生曾设法为我介绍过教职，这次见面，他向我解释没有成功的原因，并殷殷问及我当时的工作情况。他这亲戚家的住处很挤，他临时借住在这里，看来心情是很紧迫的。我们大约谈了一小时辞去，台先生一直送我们到大院门口才互道珍重而别。不料，从此一别，就是悠长的四十余年的睽隔！
    台先生是未名社成员，是著名的文学家和书法家。未名社成员中搞翻译的较多，只有台先生专门从事小说创作，二十年代便出版了短篇小说集《地之子》和《建塔者》，收入鲁迅主编的《未名新集》丛书中。前者多从民间取材，“将乡间的死生，泥土的气息，移在纸上”（鲁迅语）；后者歌颂“以精诚以赤血供奉于唯一的信仰”的“时代的先知们”（本书后记语）。这两种特色在当时的文坛上都是难能可贵的。除小说外，台先生还研究古典文学，很早就在《小说月报》的“中国文学研究专号”上发表过《北宋词人》那样的论文，他的《鲁迅先生整理中国古文学之成绩》一文，是关于鲁迅整理古籍方面的较早的一篇名作。
    我有一时期搜集鲁迅集外佚文，写信请台先生予以指导。他用毛笔工整地抄给我一篇鲁迅的《谢承〈后汉书〉序》，文末附识云：“先生辑谢承《后汉书》，未编入《全集》；此序系景宋夫人于２８年抄寄台静农者。”解放之初，我将此序文交重庆《大众文艺》月刊公开发表，后由唐弢同志收入《鲁迅全集补遗续编》中。台先生和鲁迅先生交谊很深，这从鲁迅给他的那４０多封推心置腹、任意而谈的信中即可看出。我曾希望他能写有关鲁迅的回忆录，他回信说：“承嘱为豫师回忆录，虽有此意，然苦于生事，所忆复不全，故终未能动笔也。”那时教授的生活很清苦，难得有余裕提笔为文，台先生的鲁迅回忆录没有写成，实在是一件很可惜的事。
    台先生一直从事教育工作，曾在北平辅仁大学和厦门大学等校任教。抗战时期，避寇入蜀，执教于国立女子师范学院。这学院设在江津白沙镇长江南岸，环境是很幽静的。我有一次去白沙，曾到学院拜访过他。未经什么人介绍，但见面时我没有一点陌生感觉。记得他的客室的土墙上，挂着一幅他手书的鲁迅旧体诗的长卷。他在这个学院任教数年，很受学生欢迎。但到了１９４６年，他就再也不能留下来了。抗战胜利后，女师学院因迁校问题发生风潮，国民党教育部蛮横地下令解散学院，另设所谓“整理委员会”，责令学生重新登记，不服从者除名，又解聘了一批教师，最后强行将学院由白沙迁往重庆九龙坡黄桷坪。在这次风潮中，台先生为了反对教育部的无理措施，坚决辞去教授职位，以示抗议。他在１９４６年５月给我的一封信中说：“弟为抗议教部处理失当，已自动引退。现拟暂住白沙，再定行止，倘不东下，则去成都。至于目前生活，则变卖衣物（反正要卖去的）尚可支持些时，友人亦有接济也。”同年７月，他在另一封信里又说：“今日教育派系之争，在在皆是，女院此次风潮，弟只有看不下去而引退，回想昔年女师大之事，对之惟有惭愧，然主教政者之横暴，实亦胜于昔之大虫耳。”他又告诉我：“弟已就台湾大学教授之聘……顾目前交通旅费，均属茫然，只有静候友人为之设法耳。”
    自台先生赴台以后，长时间音讯杳然，直到近数年来，才不时听到一点关于他的零星消息，知道他已从台湾大学退休，曾应友人之邀去美国短期旅游，还知道他近来出版了一本《龙坡杂文》，是他近４０年所写各体小品散文的结集。在大陆，人民文学出版社于１９８４年重新排印了《地之子》和《建塔者》；中国书法家协会主办的《中国书法》杂志，为介绍台先生的书法艺术出了一个专辑。在这样的气氛下，更令人常常记起台先生了。南望云天，怀想曷极！他究竟能不能北来一行呢？
