The National Bureau of Statistics has provided data indicating that China's industrial structure is experiencing three significant shifts:

    △ Ownership structure is tilting towards non-state-owned enterprises
    △ Regional structure is tilting towards coastal areas
    △ Industrial structure is tilting towards investment and high-end consumer products

    Beijing, February 4th — Reporter Zhang Guorong reports: The results of China's industrial development in 1988 show that alongside the sustained high-speed growth of industrial production, the ownership structure of China's industrial production is tilting towards non-state-owned enterprises. The regional structure is tilting towards coastal areas, and the industrial structure is tilting towards investment and high-end consumer products, with new developments in these trends.

    Data from the National Bureau of Statistics indicates that in 1988, the total industrial output value of state-owned enterprises was 776.9 billion yuan, an increase of 12.7% from the previous year, contributing 8.5 percentage points to the overall industrial growth. The total industrial output value of collective-owned enterprises (including township enterprises) and other economic types of enterprises was 436.6 billion yuan, an increase of 27.9%, contributing 9.2 percentage points to the overall industrial growth, becoming the main driving force of China's industrial growth. Among these, the industrial output value of township enterprises was 170.7 billion yuan, an increase of 35%, with an additional 44.2 billion yuan in output value, accounting for 24.2% of the total new industrial output value.

    By the end of 1988, the new industrial structure was as follows: State-owned enterprises accounted for 64% of the total industrial output, a decrease of 2.9 percentage points from the previous year and 14.1 percentage points from 1982's 78.1%. Collective-owned enterprises accounted for 32.6% of the total industrial output, an increase of 2 percentage points from the previous year and 10.6 percentage points from 1982. Among these, township enterprises' share of the total industrial output increased from 6.3% in 1982 to 14.1%.

    In 1988, the total industrial output value of coastal regions was 752.2 billion yuan, an increase of 19.3% from the previous year, with an additional 121.7 billion yuan in output value, accounting for two-thirds of the national new industrial output value. This was the main driving force behind the accelerated growth of national industrial output. Notably, the industrial growth rates of Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong provinces have significantly accelerated in recent years. In 1988, these provinces saw an industrial growth rate of 25.8%, with an additional output value accounting for nearly half of the national new industrial output value, contributing 8.4 percentage points to the overall industrial growth. It is worth noting that in these five provinces, state-owned enterprises grew by only 16.5% in 1988, while collective-owned enterprises grew by 30.1%, with an additional output value accounting for 46.6% of the new output value in these provinces, of which township enterprises accounted for 26.7%.

    In 1988, the total industrial output value of central regions was 313.9 billion yuan, an increase of 14.5% from the previous year; the total industrial output value of western regions was 147.4 billion yuan, an increase of 16.7% from the previous year. The industrial growth in central and western regions was significantly lagging behind that of eastern regions, causing the industrial regional structure to tilt further towards eastern regions. From 1982 to 1988, the share of eastern regions' total industrial output value increased from 59.8% to 62%; the share of central regions decreased from 27.6% to 25.9%; and the share of western regions decreased from 12.6% to 12.1%. The regional structure has largely returned to the levels of 1965.

    In 1988, driven by strong investment and consumption demand, the industrial production structure was guided by an irrational demand structure, with processing industries continuing to grow at an excessively fast rate. The production of machinery, electronics, transportation equipment, and other investment and consumer products grew by between 20% and 40%. However, due to constraints such as resource availability, transportation conditions, and agricultural production declines, the growth of mining, raw material, and light textile industries was relatively insufficient. The total energy production increased by only 4.8%, and some products in the light industry, such as silk and sugar, saw a decrease in production, while the growth rate of other products slowed down, exacerbating market supply issues.

    In 1988, within the entire industrial sector, the share of processing industries was 43.9%, an increase of 5.8 percentage points from 1982's 38.1%. The excessively fast growth of processing industries has led to a significant tilt in the industrial structure towards processing industries.

    The irrational development of the industrial structure is a result of the excessive high-speed growth in recent years. Many experts believe that this operating environment is not conducive to the implementation of the coastal development strategy and is even less conducive to the long-term stable development of China's industrial production and the improvement of economic benefits.

### 国家统计局提供的资料表明　我工业结构三个倾斜加剧

　　国家统计局提供的资料表明
　　我工业结构三个倾斜加剧
    △所有制结构向非全民所有制倾斜
    △地区结构向东部沿海地区倾斜
    △产业结构向投资类和高档消费产品倾斜
    本报北京２月４日讯　记者张国荣报道：１９８８年我国工业发展结果显示，伴随着工业生产的持续高速增长，我国工业生产的所有制结构正在向非全民所有制倾斜，地区结构则向东部沿海地区倾斜，产业结构向投资类产品和高档消费产品倾斜态势又有新的发展。
    国家统计局提供的材料表明，１９８８年，全民所有制工业总产值７７６９亿元，比上年增长１２．７％，影响全部工业增长８．５个百分点。全民所有制工业以外的集体所有制工业（包括乡办工业）、其他经济类型工业总产值４３６６亿元，增长２７．９％，影响全部工业增长９．２个百分点，正在成为我国工业增长的主要力量。其中乡办工业产值１７０７亿元，增长３５％，新增产值４４２亿元，占全部工业新增产值的２４．２％。
    到１９８８年底，各种经济类型工业的新格局是：全民所有制工业占全部工业的比重为６４％，比上年减少２．９个百分点，比１９８２年的７８．１％减少１４．１个百分点；集体所有制工业占全部工业比重为３２．６％，比上年提高２个百分点，比１９８２年提高１０．６个百分点，其中乡办工业占全部工业的比重由１９８２年的６．３％迅速上升为１４．１％。
    去年，东部沿海地区乡及乡以上工业总产值为７５２２亿元，比上年增长１９．３％，新增产值１２１７亿元，占全国新增产值的２／３，是影响全国工业加快增长的主导力量。特别是山东、江苏、浙江、福建、广东五省近几年来工业增长速度大大加快。１９８８年比上年增长２５．８％，新增产值占全国新增产值的近一半。影响全部工业增长８．４个百分点。值得注意的是，这５个省１９８８年全民所有制工业仅增长１６．５％，而集体所有制工业增长３０．１％，新增产值占这５省新增产值的４６．６％，其中乡办工业占２６．７％。
    １９８８年，中部地区工业总产值为３１３９亿元，比上年增长１４．５％；西部地区工业总产值１４７４亿元，比上年增长１６．７％。中、西部地区工业增长明显滞后于东部地区，使工业的地区结构向东部地区加快倾斜。１９８２年至１９８８年的六年间，东部地区工业总产值的比重由５９．８％上升为６２％；中部地区的比重由２７．６％下降为２５．９％；西部地区的比重由１２．６％下降为１２．１％。地区结构又大体复归到１９６５年的水平。
    １９８８年，在强大的投资和消费需求拉力下，工业生产结构受不合理需求结构的引导，加工工业继续以过快速度增长，机械、电子、交通运输设备等生产投资类产品和消费类产品增长均在两成到４成之间，但由于受资源、运输条件和农业减产等制约，采掘工业、原材料工业和以农副产品为原料的轻纺工业增长相对不足。能源生产总量仅增长４．８％，轻工业中丝、糖等产品减产，还有一些产品增长速度放慢，市场供应矛盾加剧。
    １９８８年，在全部工业中，加工工业的比重为４３．９％，比１９８２年的３８．１％提高５．８个百分点，加工工业增长过快，带来工业产业结构向加工工业明显倾斜。
    工业结构的不合理发展，是近几年超高速发展造成的。许多专家认为，这种经营环境不利于沿海发展战略的实施，更不利于我国工业生产的长期稳定发展和经济效益的提高。
