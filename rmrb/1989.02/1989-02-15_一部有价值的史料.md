A Valuable Historical Source

Wang Xirong

Unlike others, the debut work of Chen Fukan, a student of Li Helin, the newly graduated Ph.D. in literature, is not a “…论” (essay) or a “…学” (study), but a book titled *Chronicle of Zheng Zhenqiao* (published by Book and Periodical Press in March 1988).

In the history of modern Chinese literature (and even cultural history), Zheng Zhenqiao is a figure of immense influence and contribution, second only to Lu Xun, Guo Moruo, and Mao Dun. He is a true polymath and a genius who deserves to be prominently recognized. Regardless of his deep knowledge in the fields of literature, artifacts, and art history, his literary achievements alone are remarkable, with notable works in novels, essays, dramas, literary history, and folk songs. Particularly, his works such as the illustrated edition of *History of Chinese Literature*, *Outline of Literature*, and *History of Chinese Folk Literature* are renowned in academic circles. He has authored nearly a hundred books, edited more than forty periodicals, and compiled over twenty series. His literary activities, from the early 1920s to the late 1950s, were always at the forefront of Chinese literature. After reading Chen’s chronicle, one is amazed at the academic community’s neglect of Zheng Zhenqiao. It is known that even in Japan, which has always paid attention to the study of Chinese literature, there are only one or two articles on Zheng Zhenqiao. Therefore, a book introducing Zheng Zhenqiao’s life has long been necessary.

However, this chronicle of over 500,000 words is a rare book: the family records of the subject are extremely simple, and people (including his family members) do not even know the name and birth year of his father! Because Zheng Zhenqiao never talked about himself to others, this is both his virtue and the author’s challenge. However, the author has covered this deficiency with more meaningful historical materials. For example, the little-known interactions between Zheng Zhenqiao and the first generation of Communists such as Li Dazhao, Chen Duxiu, and Zhou Enlai during the May Fourth Movement; his early translations of works by Lenin and Trotsky; his underground activities in Shanghai during the War of Resistance; his visit to the critically ill Zhou Tiaofen; his interactions with Chen Lifu and Zhu Jiahua; and his participation in the World Peace Conference held simultaneously in Paris and Prague in 1949, followed by his participation in the East China Work Team led by Dong Biwu to take over the south—all these are extremely valuable and rare information. Many of these materials are being revealed for the first time, and even Zheng Zhenqiao’s son, Zheng Erkang, said that some of these events were unknown to his family. This is indeed a marvel.

Traditionally, those who compile chronicles often fall into the trap of “covering up the faults of the virtuous.” Self-compiled chronicles for self-glorification are now rare, but compiling chronicles for others often results in either “praising ancestral virtues to glorify the family” or “listing achievements to express admiration.” Zheng Zhenqiao is indeed a virtuous person. He was straightforward and kind-hearted, often jokingly referred to as a “big kid,” and was always generous in nurturing young talents. In this aspect, he was already praised alongside Lu Xun as “Southern Lu Xun and Northern Zheng Zhenqiao.” However, no one can be “consistently correct.” Chen Fukan, with a sense of historical integrity, wrote objectively, recording Zheng Zhenqiao’s works in the 1920s that showed a vague understanding of revolutionary theory, without any concealment. This point is indeed superior to many other chronicles. I believe this method should be strongly advocated to serve as a warning for future generations, thus the value of this chronicle is not just in its historical aspect.

Therefore, a good biography of a famous person, as Liang Qichao said, is “a resource for national history,” and as Lu Xun said, “knowing people and evaluating events” is indispensable. However, I know that the author has invested a tremendous amount of effort. He visited places where the subject lived, such as Wenzhou, Beijing, and Shanghai, met dozens of the subject’s friends, reviewed countless newspapers, books, and archives, and examined hundreds of manuscripts over eight years to complete this work.

We have had enough of “empty” articles that are all show and no substance. Let us start today to emphasize the importance of historical materials and raise their status—though this does not mean abandoning theoretical research. The author of the chronicle is also doing this. His *Study of Zheng Zhenqiao* is soon to be published, and we will soon have the opportunity to appreciate it.

### 一部有价值的史料

　　一部有价值的史料
    王锡荣
    与别人不同，我国“新科”文学博士、李何林先生门生陈福康的“亮相”之作不是“……论”，不是“……学”，而是一部《郑振铎年谱》（书目文献出版社１９８８年３月版）。
    在中国现代文学史（甚至文化史）上，郑振铎是一位影响和贡献极大，可说仅次于鲁迅、郭沫若和茅盾的文坛巨擎，一位实在应当大书一笔的通人和奇才。姑不论其对文献、文物、艺术史等领域的谙熟，单以文学成就论，就有小说、散文、戏曲、文学史、民歌等等方面的显著成果，尤以（插图本）《中国文学史》、《文学大纲》和《中国俗文学史》等享誉学林。他著述不下百种，编报刊达四十余种，丛书二十余种，他的文学活动从二十年代初到五十年代末始终处在中国文学的热点上。读了陈著年谱，不禁讶然于学术界对郑振铎的漠视。据知，就连对中国文学向来注意研究的日本，迄今研究郑振铎的文章总共也只有一二篇。因此，一部介绍郑振铎生平的书早已是必要的了。
    然而这部五十余万言的年谱却是一部罕见的书：谱主的家乘资料异常简单，人们（包括其家属）甚至连他的父亲的名讳和生年也无从知道！因为郑振铎从来不对人谈自己，这正是他的美德所在，同时却也是年谱作者的难题。然而作者以更有意义的史料掩盖了这个不足。例如，五四时期郑振铎与第一代共产党人李大钊、陈独秀、周恩来等人的交往史料，鲜为人知；他早年翻译列宁、托洛茨基的著作，抗战时期在上海的地下活动、探视病危的邹韬奋，以及与陈立夫、朱家骅等人的交往史料，还有１９４９年出席在巴黎和布拉格同时举行的世界和平大会，旋又参加董必武率领的华东工作团南下接管等大事件的详情都是极有价值的珍闻。很多史料都是第一次披露，连谱主哲嗣郑尔康也说，有些事他们家属都闻所未闻。这也可谓一奇。
    历来作年谱者，最易犯“为贤者讳”的毛病。自编以自炫者今已罕有，而为前人作谱即难免“或颂扬祖德以标榜门庭，或胪列事迹以志景仰”。郑振铎当然是一位贤者，他率真忠厚，被戏称为“大孩子”，奖掖后进不遗余力，在这方面早就与鲁迅被并誉为“南迅北铎”。然而人不可能“一贯正确”，陈福康以史德为上，秉笔直书，客观地记载了郑振铎二十年代一些对于革命理论认识模糊之作等等，毫不讳避。此点实为许多年谱所不逮。我以为此法正宜大力提倡，冀予后来者以警策，是则此年谱之价值固不在作史一方面也。
    可见，一部好的名人年谱，其价值正如梁启超所说“为国史取材之资”，又如鲁迅所言“知人论事”非看不可的。然而我知道，作者所花心血甚巨。他遍访谱主生活过的温州、北京、上海等地，拜谒过谱主生前友好数十位，查阅报刊书籍无算，披阅档案手稿上百卷，历时八年而成。
    我们对“空对空”式的花拳绣腿文章早已领教够了，注重史料，提高史料学地位，请从今日始——但这里并非摒弃理论研究之意，年谱作者亦然，他的《郑振铎论》已快付梓，不久我们就将有幸领教了。
