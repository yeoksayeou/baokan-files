Beijing's New Recruits: None Returned

    Beijing has paid close attention to maintaining high quality standards in its recruitment of new soldiers. Statistics show that in 1987, 44.1% of the youth who enlisted were members of the Communist Party or the Youth League, and 42.7% had completed high school or higher education, both figures significantly exceeding the national requirements. None of the recruits from Beijing have been returned, earning praise from the Ministry of National Defense and the General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army.

    To ensure the delivery of high-quality recruits to the military, Beijing has implemented a responsibility system at all levels this year, and will also appropriately raise the standards for preferential treatment.

　　北京新兵　无一退回
    本报北京２月２７日讯  北京市在征兵工作中注意把好兵员质量关。据统计，１９８７年应征入伍青年中党团员占４４．１％，高中以上文化程度占４２．７％，远远高于国家规定的比例。从北京征的新兵无一退回，受到国防部和解放军总政治部的表扬。
    为了把高质量的兵员送入部队，北京今年层层建立了承包责任制，还将适当提高优抚标准。
