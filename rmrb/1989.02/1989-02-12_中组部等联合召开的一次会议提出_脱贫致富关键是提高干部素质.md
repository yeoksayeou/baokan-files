	The Central Organization Department, the United Front Work Department, the State Ethnic Affairs Commission, and the State Council's Leading Group for Economic Development in Poor Areas recently held a national conference to exchange experiences and discuss the training of cadres in old, minority, border, and poor areas. The conference reflected that in these regions, where cadre training is well-organized, economic development is relatively rapid, and the scope of poverty alleviation and prosperity is relatively broad. Therefore, emphasizing cadre training and improving the quality of cadres at all levels, especially leading cadres, is a crucial task.

	How can the quality of cadres be quickly improved to contribute to the poverty alleviation and prosperity of old, minority, border, and poor areas? Delegates at the conference proposed the following ideas and suggestions for reforming cadre training in these regions:

		— Regarding tasks and planning. The education of cadres in old, minority, border, and poor areas should start from the actual needs of the local areas. Currently, an important aspect is to update concepts and improve psychological qualities, to rid oneself of the constraints of closed, conservative, narrow, feudal, and self-sufficient ideas, and to establish concepts of reform and opening up, commodity economy, democratic governance, and competition and selection of the best. In the long run, the fundamental task of cadre education in these regions is to comprehensively improve the political, professional, and psychological qualities of cadres, and to cultivate a cadre team that is politically sound, loves the motherland, is close to the people, is cultured, understands technology, is capable, and knows how to manage. In planning, the relationship between long-term needs and immediate needs, key points and general points, academic education, on-the-job training, and knowledge updating and supplementary training should be properly handled.

		— Regarding training methods and approaches. Training cadres should not only focus on school education but also on practical training; not only on local training but also on off-site training. Practical training includes taking on responsibilities at work, job rotation, on-the-job training, and internships. These training methods are beneficial for cadres to broaden their horizons, update their concepts, accumulate work experience, and enhance their abilities. They are effective ways to train cadres and deserve more attention.

		— Regarding training bases and teaching reforms. Given China's current economic strength and shortage of teachers, it is not advisable to pursue the expansion of training bases. Instead, efforts should be made to revitalize the existing bases and funds through reforms. County-level cadre training bases should develop into multi-functional training centers, striving for an open, socialized, and benefit-oriented school model. Teaching reforms should increase courses that are practical and targeted. Teaching methods should aim to develop the abilities of the trainees, advocating for inspiration and discussion-based approaches. The construction of the teaching staff should follow the path of combining full-time and part-time work, expanding part-time work. Efforts should be made to improve the professional level and practical abilities of full-time teachers, advocating for versatility. Continuing to support the pairing assistance of training cadre education teachers from developed regions to old, minority, border, and poor areas.

　　中组部等联合召开的一次会议提出   
    脱贫致富关键是提高干部素质
    本报讯  最近，由中央组织部、统战部、国家民委、国务院贫困地区经济开发领导小组联合召开的全国老少边穷地区干部培训工作经验交流和研讨会上反映：在老、少、边、穷地区，哪里的干部培训工作抓得好，哪里的经济发展就比较快，脱贫致富的面也就比较宽。因此，重视培训干部，提高各级干部、特别是领导干部的素质，是雪中送炭的工作。
    如何尽快提高干部的素质，为老少边穷地区脱贫致富作出贡献？与会同志就这些地区的干部培训工作改革提出了如下设想和建议：
    ——关于任务与规划。老少边穷地区的干部教育，要从当地实际需要出发。当前的一个重要方面，就是更新观念，改善心理素质，摆脱闭塞、守旧、狭隘、宗法、自给自足等观念的束缚，树立改革开放观念、商品经济观念、民主建政观念、竞争择优观念等等。从长远看，全面改善干部的政治、业务、心理素质，培养政治思想好、热爱祖国、密切联系群众，有文化、懂技术、有能力、会管理的干部队伍，是这些地区干部教育的根本任务。在规划的制订上，要处理好长远需要和现实需要的关系，重点与一般的关系，学历教育、岗位培训和知识更新补缺培训的关系。
    ——关于培训途径与方式。培训干部不仅要重视学校培养，还要重视实践培养；不仅要在本地培养，还要重视易地培养。其中，实践培养包括在工作中压担子、岗位轮换、带职锻炼、实习等。这些培养途径，有利于干部开阔视野、更新观念，积累工作经验、增长才干，是培养干部的有效途径，需要引起更大的重视。
    ——关于培训基地与教学改革。在我国当前经济实力不强、师资匮乏的情况下，不宜过于追求扩大基地建设，而要以改革搞活精神，充分发挥现有基地和经费的作用。县一级干训基地要向多功能培训中心发展，要朝着开放的、社会化的、注重效益的建校模式努力。要重视教学改革，增加实用性、针对性强的课程。教学方法要以开发学员能力为目标，提倡启发、研讨式。师资队伍建设要走专兼结合、扩大兼职的路子。要注重提高专职师资的专业水平和实践能力，提倡一专多能。继续搞好发达地区对老少边穷地区培训干部教育师资的对口支援。
