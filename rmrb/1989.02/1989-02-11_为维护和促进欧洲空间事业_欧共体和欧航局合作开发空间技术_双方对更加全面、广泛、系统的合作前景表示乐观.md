The European Community and the European Space Agency have emphasized the need for Europe to comprehensively consider the development and application of space technology in the context of realizing an internal market. This is to jointly safeguard and promote the interests of the European space industry internationally.

The European Commission announced today that Jacques Delors, the Chairman, and other leaders met with Professor Reimar Lüst, Director-General of the European Space Agency, on February 7. The European Space Agency formulated a long-term research plan at the end of 1987, and the European Community proposed six guidelines for the development of space technology in July 1988. The leaders of both sides discussed in depth the issue of strengthening cooperation between the two organizations to develop space technology based on these two documents.

Both the European Community and the European Space Agency are satisfied with the achievements of their cooperation so far and are optimistic about the prospects for more comprehensive, extensive, and systematic cooperation. Both sides agreed to strengthen cooperation in the three application areas of space technology: Earth observation, telecommunications, and microgravity. Both sides believe that Europe must, through more systematic and coordinated efforts, cope with the increasing international competition, especially in the commercial sector.

Both sides are also preparing to jointly initiate the potential of space development for environmental protection in Europe, as well as research and monitoring of the environment.

The European Space Agency is an institution for European countries to jointly carry out space activities. Since its establishment in 1975, it has mainly organized the development and launch of the "Ariane" rocket and the development of the "Space Laboratory."

    双方对更加全面、广泛、系统的合作前景表示乐观
    新华社布鲁塞尔２月９日电（记者诸葛仓麟）欧洲共同体和欧洲航天局强调，欧洲有必要在实现内部大市场前景下，通盘考虑空间技术的开发和应用，以便在国际上共同维护和促进欧洲空间事业的利益。
    欧共体委员会今天宣布，雅克·德洛尔主席及其他领导人２月７日在这里会见了欧航局局长雷马尔·吕斯特教授。欧航局１９８７年底制定了长期研究规划；欧共体在１９８８年７月提出了发展空间技术的６项方针。双方领导人在会晤时，在上述两个文件基础上深入讨论了两个组织加强合作，开发空间技术问题。
    欧共体和欧航局对双方合作已经取得的成果以及开展更加全面、广泛、系统的合作的前景表示满意。双方一致同意今后在地球观测、电讯、微重力３个空间技术的应用领域加强合作。双方认为，欧洲必须通过更加系统和更加协调的努力，对付日益增长的、特别是在商业领域里的国际竞争。
    双方还准备共同倡议欧洲利用空间开发为环境保护提供的潜力，研究和监测环境。
    欧洲航天局是欧洲国家联合开展航天活动的机构，１９７５年成立以来，主要组织研制、发射“阿丽亚娜”火箭和研制“空间实验室”。
