	Preventing Accidents, Ensuring Safety: Strengthening Management of Fireworks and Firecrackers
	By Wang Weixiang

	BEIJING, Feb. 3 (Xinhua) -- With the Spring Festival approaching, preventing accidents caused by the burning of fireworks and firecrackers has become a major concern.

	Reporter Wang Weixiang visited the Public Security Department and the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau to learn that in recent years, local governments and public security departments have implemented extensive and specific measures to manage the production, storage, transportation, sales, and burning of fireworks and firecrackers. Many large and medium-sized cities have seen a significant reduction in fireworks-related accidents.

	As the 1989 Spring Festival approaches, various provinces and cities have made specific arrangements. For example, the Shandong Provincial People's Government has strictly regulated that, except for the night of the Lunar New Year's Eve, fireworks and firecrackers are not allowed to be burned in urban areas from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. the next day. The Chongqing Municipal Public Security Bureau has stipulated that on the night of the Lunar New Year's Eve, district and county public security bureaus must designate a leader to oversee this work and organize patrols and inspections along major streets, transportation routes, and urban areas to prevent and punish the illegal burning of fireworks and firecrackers. Shanghai has designated areas where the burning of fireworks and firecrackers is prohibited, revoked the licenses of 561 shops in the city area that sell fireworks and firecrackers, and decided to organize 50,000 public security officers, armed police, joint defense personnel, and public security maintenance officers to patrol starting from February 4. Beijing has reduced the total supply of fireworks and firecrackers by 25% compared to the same period last year; the number of sales outlets has been reduced from 2,533 last year to 2,086 this year; and the ban on certain types of fireworks and firecrackers and the expansion of restricted areas continue.

	Currently, the main issue is the illegal production of fireworks and firecrackers by a large number of individual households, which has led to a significant number of explosion incidents. According to statistics from the relevant departments of the Public Security Department, there are more than 30,000 households in Hebei Province alone that produce fireworks and firecrackers. These individual workshops are often located in villages and towns, with poor equipment, outdated production processes, and operators who lack safety knowledge. An explosion in one household can affect the surrounding area. It is understood that the Ministry of Light Industry and other relevant state departments have begun to formulate a series of national standards for the safety and quality of fireworks and firecrackers.

### 预防事故  保证安全  各地加强烟花爆竹燃放管理

　　预防事故  保证安全
    各地加强烟花爆竹燃放管理
    本报讯  记者王维香报道：春节临近，怎样防止因燃放烟花爆竹造成灾害，是大家关心的问题。
    记者为此走访了公安部、北京市公安局等有关部门，了解到，近几年来，各地政府和公安部门对于烟花爆竹的生产、储存、运输、销售以及燃放作了大量具体的管理、限制工作。不少大中城市“爆竹事故”明显下降。
    １９８９年春节来临，各省市又作出具体部署。如山东省人民政府严格规定：除农历除夕之夜，城镇在２２点至次日６点，不准燃放烟花爆竹。重庆市公安局规定：除夕之夜，各区、县局必须确定一位领导同志负责此项工作，并组织力量，深入城镇、主要街道、交通干线巡逻检查和查处乱燃乱放烟花爆竹的行为。上海市规定了禁止燃放烟花爆竹的地区，吊销了市区５６１家商店经销烟花爆竹的许可证，同时决定从２月４日起，每天组织公安干警、武警、联防队员和治保干部５万名，进行巡逻。北京市今年烟花爆竹的总货源比去年同期压缩２５％；销售网点由去年的２５３３个减少到２０８６个；同时继续扩大禁放品种和禁放区域。
    目前存在的问题是：大量个体户非法生产烟花爆竹，造成爆炸的事件相当突出。据公安部有关部门统计，仅河北省就有３万多户生产烟花爆竹。这些个体作坊多设在村、镇，设备简陋，生产工艺落后，操作人员大多不懂安全常识，一户爆炸，殃及四邻。据了解，轻工部等国家有关部门已着手制定《烟花爆竹的安全与质量要求》系列国家标准。
