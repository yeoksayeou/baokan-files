In the Democratic Republic of Germany, whether at the dining table or in the hotel room, there are always flower vases, and they are filled with fresh flowers. It is said that this is the case throughout the year. On the streets and in markets, there are stalls selling fresh flowers. When visiting the Buchenwald Memorial, we saw the place where Thälmann was martyred, and in front of the tombstones of unnamed heroes, people offered bouquets of fresh flowers and wreaths made of fresh flowers. Seeing this, one cannot help but feel reverent. On the way back to China, stopping in Romania, standing on the streets of Bucharest, one also sees groups of people selecting their favorite fresh flowers at flower stalls. It is said that in many countries, flower vases must contain fresh flowers, and gifts are also fresh flowers. Using artificial flowers in vases or as gifts is considered very impolite.

Last year, on the eve of National Day, I was staying in Beijing. Once, when visiting my teacher, Mr. Wu Guanzhong, the conversation somehow turned to flowers. He said that in some large hotels in Beijing, there are still artificial flowers in the vases. So, he suggested to the staff that if there are no fresh flowers, please insert some grass, as grass is better than artificial flowers. Grass is green and gives people a sense of life and hope. Walking through the streets of Beijing in October, in some residential buildings with more than a dozen floors, every family's balcony is filled with pots of fresh flowers. From a distance, it looks like a giant tapestry hanging in the sky. The triangular plots on the streets, the open spaces in front of shops, and the various shapes of flower beds and flower baskets made of pots of colorful flowers, the Tiananmen Square is a sea of flowers, attracting tens of thousands of people. Standing in this sea of flowers, I felt my mind expand, and my soul seemed to be purified.

Not long ago, I visited the National Tourism and Artisan Products Fair in Taiyuan and saw that many manufacturers had produced new products based on market demand changes. Out of homesickness, I came to a paper flower factory from Jiangxi and admired their paper flowers. These flowers are quite exquisite in craftsmanship and the colors are also quite good. After talking with two old colleagues, one of them said that it had been three days and no one had placed an order. This made me think. With the improvement of living standards, people's aesthetic tastes are also changing, developing, and improving. The trend of planting and raising flowers and plants is becoming more popular. Obviously, people are becoming less interested in lifeless paper flowers. Therefore, I suggested to the old colleagues that they should grasp the development trend of the market from a macro perspective, and the products should continuously adapt to the new needs of the people.

Of course, considering our "national conditions," considering our living standards and aesthetic standards, paper flowers will still have a certain market and cannot be completely ignored. But living flowers can purify the air, beautify the environment, and more importantly, express good wishes. People will increasingly love fresh flowers, which is very natural and a sign of people's stable and improving lives. Our country has already seen the emergence of many specialized households for growing fresh flowers, and some provinces and cities have even established flower associations. I believe that fresh flowers will increasingly enter our lives, making our environment and our motherland more beautiful.

　　花的联想
    董其中
    在民主德国访问时，无论在餐桌上，还是在旅馆的房间里，都摆有花瓶，且插的都是鲜花，据说一年四季如此。街头和集市，有出售鲜花的小摊。参观布亨瓦尔德纪念馆，我们看到台尔曼的就义处，一些无名烈士的墓志铭前，人们敬献的也都是一束束鲜花和用鲜花制作的花圈，面对此景，不禁肃然起敬。回国途经罗马尼亚，驻足布加勒斯特街头，也看到一群群的人们在花摊前选购心爱的鲜花。据说，在许多国家，花瓶里必须插鲜花，送人的也都是鲜花，用假花插花瓶或送人，是很不礼貌的。
    去年国庆前夕，我客住北京，一次看望老师吴冠中先生，不知怎么话题转到了花上。他说，北京一些大宾馆摆设的花瓶里还有插假花的，于是他向服务员建议，如果没有鲜花，请你们插上草，草也比那假花好，草是绿的，它给人以生命和希望。漫步十月的北京街头，有的十几层的居民宿舍楼，家家户户的阳台上都摆满了一盆盆的鲜花，远远望去，像是挂在天空中的一块超大型壁毯。那街头的三角地块，商店门前的开阔地，用各色的盆花垒起了各种造型的花坛和花篮，天安门广场更是花的海洋，吸引着成千成万的人们。我置身于这花海之中，感到胸襟开阔，心灵似乎也得到了净化。
    不久前，我在太原参观了全国旅游品工艺品内销交易会，看到不少厂家根据市场的需求变化而制作的新产品。我怀着乡情，来到我们江西一家纸花厂的产品前，观赏他们生产的纸花，这花论手工倒也精巧，论颜色也还不错。和两位老俵交谈，一位老俵说，已是第三天了，还没有人订货。这引起了我的思考。随着生活水平的提高，人们的审美趣味也在变化、发展和提高，种花养草也蔚然成风，显然，人们对没有生命的纸花越来越不感兴趣。因此，我向老俵建议，应从宏观上把握市场的发展动向，产品要不断适应群众新的需求。
    当然，鉴于我们的“国情”，鉴于我们的生活水平和审美水平，纸花还会有一定的市场，还无法完全冷落它。但有生命的鲜花能净化空气，美化环境，更能表达心愿。人们会愈加喜爱鲜花，这是很自然的，也是人们生活安定向上的表现。我国已出现不少种植鲜花的专业户，有的省市还成立了花卉协会。我想，鲜花一定会越来越多地进入我们的生活领域，把我们的环境、把我们的祖国装点得更加美丽。
