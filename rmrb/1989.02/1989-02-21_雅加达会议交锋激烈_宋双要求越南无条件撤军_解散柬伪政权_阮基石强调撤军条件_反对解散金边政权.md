Intense Clashes at Jakarta Meeting
Son Sann Demands Unconditional Vietnamese Withdrawal and Dissolution of Phnom Penh Puppet Regime
Nguyen Co Thach Emphasizes Conditions for Withdrawal and Opposes Dissolution of Phnom Penh Regime

Xinhua News Agency Jakarta, February 19 (Reporter Li Yongming) - Democratic Kampuchea United Government Prime Minister Son Sann today reiterated that Vietnam's withdrawal from Cambodia must have a definite timetable, must be unconditional, and must be conducted under international supervision.

This was stated by Son Sann in his speech at the opening of the second informal Jakarta meeting on the Cambodian issue on the afternoon of the 19th.

He said that to hold elections and to fully exercise the self-determination of the Cambodian people, the illegal regime in Phnom Penh, which is backed by the Vietnamese army, must not be allowed to continue. The four-party provisional united national reconciliation government led by Prince Sihanouk should organize these free elections.

Regarding the issue of an international peacekeeping force, he said that there is no better option than the United Nations sending a force, because the United Nations has the personnel and financial resources to accomplish this task fairly and justly.

His speech refuted Vietnam's claim that it does not want the United Nations to send a peacekeeping force to Cambodia.

Son Sann urged the participants to adopt the five-point peace plan recently proposed by Chairman of the Democratic Kampuchea United Government, Prince Sihanouk, as the basis for solving the Cambodian issue.

Son Sann also requested that the following statement be added to the draft of the final document of this meeting: "After the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops, it is necessary to immediately deploy a United Nations international peacekeeping force. Its tasks are to prevent one side of the Democratic Kampuchea from seizing power, to prevent foreign troops from re-invading and interfering in Cambodia, and to prevent civil war in Cambodia."

Thai Foreign Minister Siddhi Savetsila emphasized in his speech that the time for endless disputes or settling old scores has passed, and the participants should seriously discuss substantive issues that can advance the meeting.

He reiterated that the key to achieving a comprehensive political solution to the Cambodian issue is the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops.

He said that the early withdrawal of Vietnamese troops will help the various Cambodian parties achieve national reconciliation and also build confidence and create conditions for the normalization of relations between countries in the region.

Singapore Foreign Minister Wong Kan Seng said in his speech that Singapore supports the five-point proposal for a peaceful solution to the Cambodian issue proposed by Chairman of the Democratic Kampuchea United Government, Prince Sihanouk.

Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach repeated in his speech today the unreasonable demands made by Vietnam at the first informal Jakarta meeting held in July last year, that Vietnam's withdrawal must be conditioned on the guarantee that the Democratic Kampuchea side will not regain power.

Nguyen Co Thach also criticized the proposal by Chairman of the Democratic Kampuchea United Government, Prince Sihanouk, to simultaneously dissolve the Democratic Kampuchea United Government and the Phnom Penh regime in order to hold free and fair elections.

Local observers believe that Nguyen Co Thach's speech indicates that Vietnam still lacks sincerity in solving the Cambodian issue.

February 19, the second informal meeting on the Cambodian issue opened at the Indonesia Hotel in the center of Jakarta.

　　雅加达会议交锋激烈
    宋双要求越南无条件撤军　解散柬伪政权
     阮基石强调撤军条件　反对解散金边政权
    新华社雅加达２月１９日电  （记者李永明）民主柬埔寨联合政府总理宋双今天重申，越南从柬埔寨撤军必须有一个确定的时间表，必须无条件并在国际监督下进行。
    这是宋双在１９日下午开幕的关于柬埔寨问题的第二次雅加达非正式会议上发表讲话时说的。
    他说，为了举行大选和使柬埔寨人民充分履行其自决权，由越南军队扶植的金边非法政权绝对不能维持下去。以西哈努克亲王为首的四方联合临时民族和解政府应该组织这次自由的大选。
    关于国际维持和平部队问题，他说，没有比联合国派出部队更好的了，因为联合国拥有能胜任此项工作的和公正的人员以及充足的财力帮助柬埔寨。
    他的讲话驳斥了越南关于它不希望联合国向柬埔寨派遣维持和平部队的主张。
    宋双吁请与会者能够采纳民柬主席西哈努克亲王最近提出的五点和平计划作为解决柬埔寨问题的基础。
    宋双在发言中还要求把以下这段话加进这次会议拟议中的最后文件的草案中，即：“越南撤军后有必要立即部署联合国的国际维持和平部队。它的任务是防止民柬一方单独掌权，防止外国军队再次入侵并干涉柬埔寨，防止在柬埔寨发生内战。”
    泰国外长西提在会上发言时强调，争执不休或算旧帐的时期已经结束，与会者应该认真讨论能使会议取得进展的实质性问题。
    他重申，促使柬埔寨问题能获得全面政治解决的关键是越南撤军。
    他说，越南尽快撤军将有助于柬埔寨各方达成民族和解，同时也为本地区国家之间关系正常化树立信心和创造条件。
    新加坡外长黄根成在会上发言说，新加坡支持民柬主席西哈努克亲王提出的和平解决柬埔寨问题的五点建议。
    越南外长阮基石在今天会上的发言中重复越南在去年７月举行的第一次雅加达非正式会议上的无理主张，即越南撤军必须以保证民柬方面不重新掌权为条件。
    阮基石还指责民柬主席西哈努克亲王这样的主张：同时解散民柬联合政府和金边政权以便进行自由和公正的大选。
    此间观察家认为，阮基石的发言表明，越南仍然缺乏解决柬埔寨问题的诚意。
