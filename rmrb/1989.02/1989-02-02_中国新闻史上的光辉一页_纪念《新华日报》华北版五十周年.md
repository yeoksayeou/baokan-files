On January 1, 1939, the North China Edition of the New China Daily (hereinafter referred to as the North China Edition) was published in the Taihang Anti-Japanese Base Area. At that time, Japanese imperialism had occupied a large part of China, and the Communist Party of China led the Eighth Route Army to establish anti-Japanese base areas in the rear of the enemy in North China, which were in the process of development and consolidation. To propagate and guide the anti-Japanese war in North China, under the proposal of Comrades Zhu De and Peng Dehuai, with the support of Comrade Zhou Enlai, and the approval of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, this newspaper was established.

The North China Edition was the organ of the North China Bureau of the Communist Party of China. To strengthen the leadership of the North China Edition, the North China Bureau established a Party Newspaper Committee, with members including Comrades Yang Shangkun, Peng Dehuai, Zuo Quan, Fu Zhong, Luo Ronghuan, Lu Dingyi, Li Da Zhang, Deng Xiaoping, Liu Bocheng, and the editor-in-chief and general manager of the newspaper, He Yun, along with deputy editor-in-chief Chen Kehan and deputy manager Du Yuyin sometimes attending. Lu Dingyi served as the chairman of the Party Newspaper Committee. The Party Newspaper Committee held monthly meetings to discuss the work of the organ newspaper, including propaganda and reporting plans and important commentaries. Deputy editor-in-chief Chen Kehan and Han Jin successively stayed in the North China Bureau to handle the liaison between the newspaper committee and the newspaper, and wrote important commentary articles.

The North China Edition was one of the most influential newspapers led by the Communist Party of China at that time. From its establishment in 1939 to its cessation in September 1943, it lasted for 4 years and 9 months. During this period, the Anti-Japanese War was in the strategic stalemate phase, which was the most difficult time for the anti-Japanese war in the rear. The Japanese invaders basically stopped their military attacks on the front line and intensified political appeasement against Chiang Kai-shek; at the same time, they transferred most of their troops in China to North China to carry out continuous and repeated "mopping-up" operations in various anti-Japanese base areas, attempting to annihilate the Eighth Route Army and consolidate their occupation of North China. The Kuomintang government became increasingly passive in the anti-Japanese war, intensifying its "restrictions" and provocations against the Communist Party, the Eighth Route Army, and the New Fourth Army, and frequent "friction" incidents occurred, causing pain to friends and joy to enemies. The situation was serious, affecting the outcome of the anti-Japanese war and the fate of the nation.

In the struggle to maintain the anti-Japanese war, overcome crises, and consolidate and develop anti-Japanese base areas, the North China Edition played a significant role in promoting and guiding the work. In the face of the complex and sharp struggle between the enemy, ourselves, and our allies, the propaganda and reporting of the North China Edition closely followed the overall situation of the anti-Japanese war and the tasks facing the base areas, closely combined with the actual situation, closely connected with the masses, deeply propagated the party's policies, mobilized and educated the masses to persist in the anti-Japanese war, unite, and progress, and opposed surrender, division, and retrogression, showing a high degree of party spirit.

The newspaper fully reflected the heroic deeds of the military and people in the rear of North China fighting bravely under the guidance of Comrade Mao Zedong's "On Protracted War," becoming a trumpet to inspire and encourage the people's struggle. At the beginning of the newspaper's establishment, it published articles by Commander-in-Chief Zhu De and Deputy Commander-in-Chief Peng Dehuai on the North China war situation, explaining the great significance of persisting in the anti-Japanese war in the rear of North China, pointing out that the increase of Japanese invaders in North China "is our great victory, the glory of the people of North China." "We must overcome all difficulties, endure a difficult period, and then walk on the road to victory." The newspaper published the North China war reports issued by the headquarters of the 18th Group Army and the periodic articles by Deputy Chief of Staff Zuo Quan summarizing the North China war situation, guiding military struggles. In the first year of the newspaper's establishment, it published more than 50 commentaries on military struggles and continuously introduced the experience of anti-"mopping-up" operations in the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region. The newspaper's reporters successively visited high-ranking generals of the Eighth Route Army, such as Nie Rongzhen, Lü Zhengcao, Song Shizhen, Xu Xiangqian, Luo Ronghuan, Chen Guang, Xiao Ke, Song Renqiong, Chen Xi Lian, Chen Gang, and Li Da, visited the troops and militia heroes, and published more than 100 interviews and battle reports in one year, introducing the general situation of the establishment and growth of various anti-Japanese base areas and singing the praises of the glorious deeds of the military and people of North China fighting bravely.

In the struggle to smash the Japanese invaders' so-called "cage policy," the newspaper extensively reported the achievements and experiences of the military and people of North China in widely carrying out guerrilla warfare. In 1940, our army launched the "Hundred Regiments Offensive," which caused a great sensation both domestically and internationally. The newspaper organized a special team to the headquarters of the 18th Group Army to compile and publish war reports and sent frontline reporters to write a large number of battle reports. A reader from Sichuan, signed "Yuanbo," wrote in a letter, "The Japanese devils have been continuously bombing Chongqing, making the people here groan on the brink of death, and anger burns in everyone's heart. At this time, the commander-in-chief and deputy commander-in-chief of the 18th Group Army sent a telegram to express their condolences and launched the Hundred Regiments Offensive in response to the Japanese devils' atrocities. The snowflake-like victory reports moved everyone to tears, giving the people who had personally suffered the Japanese devils' atrocities the joy of revenge... Everyone felt that the Eighth Route Army, which lives in extremely difficult conditions and has poor equipment, is becoming stronger and stronger every day, which is the greatest glory of the Chinese nation," This letter is just a drop of water. But it reflects the great influence of the Hundred Regiments Offensive on the people of the whole country, and it is also a great encouragement to the news workers in the rear.

In the construction of the anti-Japanese base areas, the North China Edition prominently propagated the establishment of the "three-thirds" democratic government. Smashing the traitorous puppet government, reforming the old government, and establishing a democratic government had great historical significance in mobilizing and organizing the people to persist in the anti-Japanese war in the rear and promoting the democratic movement in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. In April 1940, the North China Edition continuously published commentaries to propagate the guiding ideology of establishing the "three-thirds" government. The commentary "On the Anti-Japanese Democratic Government" pointed out: "Ending the corrupt 'historical government' and establishing an anti-Japanese democratic government is the 'key to the victory of the anti-Japanese war and the success of nation-building.'" The commentary "On the Construction of the Anti-Japanese Democratic Government" pointed out that the fundamental task of the anti-Japanese democratic government is "to oppose Japanese imperialism and the traitorous and reactionary clique, to protect all anti-Japanese people, to adjust the lives of various anti-Japanese classes, and to improve the lives of workers and peasants." In 1941, the North China Edition's base area, Taihang, held the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Provisional People's Congress, elected and established the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Government, and the newspaper conducted continuous and concentrated propaganda; it also introduced the political construction of the Jin-Cha-Ji and other base areas. Through extensive reporting, it reflected the unprecedentedly enthusiastic event of establishing a democratic government in the border area, marking the prosperity and consolidation of the anti-Japanese base areas.

Holding high the banner of the anti-Japanese national united front, educating the broad masses of soldiers and people to correctly understand and deal with the complex political situation at that time, and firmly believing in the unity of the anti-Japanese struggle, recognizing the necessity of conducting reasonable, beneficial, and restrained struggles, was essential for persisting in the unity of the anti-Japanese struggle. After the establishment of the North China Edition, in the face of the increasingly serious situation of Chiang Kai-shek's passive anti-Japanese and active anti-communist stance, it continuously published commentaries, emphasizing that "in the future long-term anti-Japanese war, only the continuous development and consolidation of the anti-Japanese national united front can guarantee the rapid arrival of overcoming difficulties and achieving victory." At that time, some Kuomintang troops had not yet withdrawn from the Yellow River, and some local Kuomintang officials also expressed their willingness to unite for the anti-Japanese struggle. The North China Edition timely sent reporters to interview some representative figures, propagating their anti-Japanese achievements and their continued anti-Japanese statements (some of which had the nature of "keeping a record for future reference").

Regarding the Kuomintang's anti-communist friction and sabotage of the anti-Japanese war in the rear, the newspaper conducted exposure and condemnation. The newspaper continuously published commentaries, pointing out that "the essence of friction is the Japanese devils' trick to split the anti-Japanese national united front," and is "an unfortunate phenomenon caused by the instigation and provocation of traitors." For those who were used by the enemy to create friction, it was hoped that they would "have a awakening and repent." The newspaper's special correspondent Chen Kehan interviewed Deputy Commander-in-Chief Peng Dehuai, raising seven questions about the truth of the friction and solutions, and Peng Dehuai answered them one by one. The newspaper published them in three installments and published a commentary, stating that our only hope is that they will stop all friction immediately and turn their blades towards the Japanese devils. At that time, the enlightened people in the Kuomintang army, the Eighth Route Army, the Death Squad, and readers from all walks of life often wrote to the newspaper, praising that "the characteristic of the newspaper is that every time the situation becomes serious, it blows the trumpet and rings the alarm bell, awakening millions of soldiers and people to struggle to overcome the crisis."

Paying attention to international propaganda and reporting was a major feature of the North China Edition. The newspaper had four pages and four columns per issue, with the third column publishing international news and commentaries. Even during the period of marching and transferring, the newspaper did not interrupt the publication by changing from lead printing to oil printing wartime edition. At that time, it was during the period before and after the outbreak of World War II, and the international situation was complicated and changing, closely related to China's anti-Japanese war. To help the broad masses of readers, who were in the mountains, have a global perspective and timely understand the trends of the international situation, understand the party's relevant policies, correctly judge the situation, and enhance their confidence in victory, it was of great importance. At that time, the Xinhua News Agency in Yan'an did not broadcast much international news, and the newspaper directly copied and received broadcasts from major news agencies around the world, selected and edited them into articles, with a large amount of work. The international edition also had various columns such as "Current Affairs," "International Issues Analysis," and "International Forum." The editor-in-chief He Yun and the editor-in-chief of the international edition Zuo Mowild wrote commentary articles on international issues, which were well received by readers.

The party's policies and guidelines reflect the interests of the people, are supported by the people, and become the practical actions of the masses. In this process, the newspaper played an important role as a bridge and link. After the publication of the North China Edition, various places organized reader groups, treating the newspaper as an indispensable spiritual food. Various levels of party and government organizations held meetings to deploy work, which were based on the newspaper's reports and explanations of domestic and international major events and the situation in the region, linking the current tasks of the unit with the national and regional situation, so that the masses had a deep understanding of the current tasks and enhanced their enthusiasm for implementation. The party spirit of the newspaper and the people's nature were thus organically combined.

The comrades of the newspaper used their wisdom, blood, sweat, and even their lives to nurture the North China Edition and made the greatest contribution to the great cause of national liberation and people's happiness. In May 1942, during the anti-"mopping-up" campaign, 46 comrades, including the editor-in-chief He Yun, were martyred, which was the heaviest loss in the history of the North China Edition. Half a century has passed, and this history should not be forgotten!

　　中国新闻史上的光辉一页
    ——纪念《新华日报》华北版五十周年
    何承
    １９３９年元旦，《新华日报》华北版（以下简称华北版）在太行抗日根据地创刊。当时正是日本帝国主义侵占我国大片领土，我党领导八路军在华北敌后创建的抗日根据地进入发展和巩固时期。为了宣传、指导华北抗战，由朱德、彭德怀同志提议，周恩来同志支持，中共中央六届六中全会批准，创办这张报纸。
    华北版是中共中央北方局机关报。北方局为加强华北版的领导，成立了党报委员会，成员先后有杨尚昆、彭德怀、左权、付钟、罗瑞卿、陆定一、李大章、邓小平、刘伯承等领导同志和报社社长兼总编辑何云、副总编辑陈克寒、副社长杜毓沄有时列席。陆定一任党报委员会主任。党报委员会每月开会讨论机关报的工作，包括宣传报道计划和重要评论。报社副总编辑陈克寒、韩进先后常驻北方局，负责报委和报社的联系，撰写重要评论文章。
    华北版是当时我党领导的具有重大影响的报纸之一，从创刊到１９４３年９月终刊，历时４年９个月。这段时期，抗日战争处于战略相持阶段，是敌后抗战最为艰苦的年月。日本侵略军基本停止了对正面战场的军事进攻，对蒋介石加紧进行政治诱降；同时把大部侵华兵力调到华北，对各抗日根据地进行连续轮番的大“扫荡”，妄图消灭八路军，巩固其对华北的占领。国民党政府对抗战日趋消极，对共产党、八路军、新四军加紧进行“限制”和挑衅，亲者痛、仇者快的“摩擦”事件频繁发生。局势严重，关系着抗战成败，民族存亡。
    华北版在坚持抗战、克服危机，巩固与发展抗日根据地的斗争中，发挥了重大推动和指导作用。在敌、我、友斗争十分尖锐复杂的形势下，华北版的宣传报道紧紧围绕抗战全局和根据地面临的任务，密切结合实际，密切联系群众，深入宣传党的方针政策，动员和教育广大群众坚持抗战、团结、进步，反对投降、分裂、倒退，表现出高度的党性。
    充分反映华北敌后军民根据毛泽东同志《论持久战》的指导思想英勇奋战的业绩，成为鼓舞和激励人民斗争的号角。报纸创刊之始，即刊载朱德总司令、彭德怀副总司令论述华北战局的文章，阐明坚持华北敌后抗战的重大意义，指出日本侵略军增兵华北“是我们的重大胜利，是华北军民的光荣。”“必须克服一切困难，熬过一段困难的过程，才能走向胜利的坦途。”报纸刊载十八集团军总部发表的华北战报，刊载左权副总参谋长定期撰写的综述华北战局的文章，指导军事斗争。报纸创办的第一年中，就发表了有关军事斗争的社论五十多篇，并连续介绍晋察冀边区的反“扫荡”经验。报社记者先后访问聂荣臻、吕正操、宋时轮、徐向前、罗荣桓、陈光、肖克、宋任穷、陈锡联、陈赓、李达等八路军高级将领，访问部队、民兵的战斗英雄，一年间发表访问记和战斗通讯一百多篇，介绍各抗日根据地创建、成长的概貌，讴歌华北军民浴血奋战的丰功伟绩。
    在粉碎日本侵略军所谓“囚笼政策”的斗争中，报纸大量报道华北军民广泛开展游击战的成果和经验。１９４０年我军发动“百团大战”，在国内外激起巨大反响。报社组织专门小组到十八集团军总部编发战报，派出随军记者采写大量战斗通讯。一位来自四川署名“远波”的读者来信中说，“日寇连续疯狂轰炸重庆，使这里的同胞呻吟在死亡的边缘，愤怒燃烧着每一个人的心。正在这时，朱彭总副司令驰电慰问，并发动百团大战回答日寇的暴行。雪片飞来的捷报感动得大家流下热泪，使得亲身遭受日寇暴行而愤怒的同胞获得复仇的愉快……大家都感觉到像八路军这样生活异常困苦，装备不好的队伍，仍一天比一天壮大坚强，那是中华民族最大的光荣”，这封信只是一滴水。但它反映出百团大战在全国人民中所产生的巨大影响，也是对敌后新闻工作者的一大鼓励。
    在抗日根据地的建设中，华北版突出宣传“三三制”民主政权的建立。粉碎汉奸伪政权，改造旧政权，建立民主政权，对动员组织人民坚持敌后抗战，对推动国民党统治区民主运动，具有重大历史意义。１９４０年４月，华北版连续发表社论，宣传建立“三三制”政权指导思想。社论《论抗日民主政权》指出：“结束腐朽的‘历史上的政权’，建立抗日民主政权，是‘抗战必胜，建国必成’的中心关键。”《论建设抗日民主政权》指出，抗日民主政权的“根本任务是反对日本帝国主义及卖国的汉奸反动派，保护一切抗日人民，调节各抗日阶层的生活，改善工农的生活”。１９４１年，华北版驻地太行区举行晋冀鲁豫临时参议会，选举成立晋冀鲁豫边区政府，报纸进行了连续、集中的宣传；对晋察冀等根据地的政权建设，也分别作了介绍。通过大量报道，反映空前热烈的边区建立民主政权的盛举，标志着抗日根据地的欣欣向荣日臻巩固。
    高擎抗日民族统一战线的旗帜，教育广大军民正确认识和对待当时复杂的政治形势，坚定团结抗日信心，认识进行有理有利有节的斗争，是坚持团结抗日所必需。华北版创刊后，针对蒋介石消极抗日、积极反共日渐明显的严重形势，连续发表社论，强调指出“在今后的长期抗战中，也只有抗日民族统一战线之继续发展与巩固，才能保证克服困难，争取胜利的迅速到来”。当时，部分国民党军队仍未撤过黄河，有的国民党地方负责人也有团结抗日的表示。华北版及时派记者对某些代表人物进行访问，宣传他们确有抗战业绩，以及继续团结抗日的言论（有的具有“立此存照”的性质）。
    对于国民党在敌后反共摩擦破坏抗日的劣迹罪行，则进行揭露和声讨。报社连续发表社论，指出“摩擦的本质，是日寇企图分裂抗日民族统一战线的奸计”，是“经过汉奸之策动挑拨发生的不幸现象”。对被敌利用搞摩擦的“专家”，希望他们“有所觉悟，翻然改悔”。报社特派员陈克寒对彭德怀副总司令作过专访，提出有关摩擦真相及解决办法的七个问题，彭总一一作答，报纸分三期连载，并发表社论，表明我们唯一期望是他们迅速停止一切摩擦行为，以刀锋转向日寇。当时国民党部队中的有识之士，八路军、决死队的指战员以及各界读者，经常给报社写信，称赞“报纸的特点就在于：每到时局严重的关头，一定吹起号角，打响警钟，唤醒千百万军民，为克服危机而奋斗。”
    重视国际宣传报道，是华北版的一大特色。报纸每期四开四版，以第三版刊登国际消息和评论，即使在行军转移期间，报纸由铅印改出油印战时版也不间断。当时正处于第二次世界大战爆发前后，国际局势错综复杂，动荡多变，与中国抗战密切相关。为帮助广大读者身在山中，胸有全局，及时了解国际时局动向，了解党的有关方针政策，正确判明形势，提高胜利信心，至关重要。当时延安新华社播发国际新闻不多，报社直接抄收世界各大通讯社广播，斟酌去取，编辑成文，工作量很大。国际版还设有时论、国际问题分析、国际论坛等多种栏目。社长何云、国际版主编左漠野撰写国际问题评论文章，很受读者欢迎。
    党的方针政策体现人民的利益，受到人民的拥护，变成群众的实践行动，这中间报纸发挥了重要的桥梁纽带作用。华北版出版后，各地纷纷组织读者会，把报纸作为不可缺少的精神食粮。各级党政组织开会部署工作，都是依据报纸报道、讲解的国内外大事、本地区情况，把本单位的当前任务同全国、全区形势联系起来，使群众对当前任务有深刻认识，提高贯彻落实的热情。报纸的党性同人民性就是这样有机地结合在一起。
    报社同志用自己的智慧、心血、汗水以至生命哺育华北版，为争取民族解放、人民幸福的伟大事业作出最大的奉献。１９４２年５月，报社社长何云等４６位同志在反“扫荡”战役中光荣牺牲，是华北版历史上一次最沉重的损失。时间过去半个世纪，这段历史是不应忘记的！
