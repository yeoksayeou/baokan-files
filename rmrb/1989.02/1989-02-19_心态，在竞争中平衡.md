The folk song from the workers of Qingdao, "The labor combination is a fire that burns you, me, and everyone; it's not your fault, not my fault, it's because the surplus of people over jobs must be changed!" vividly expresses the psychological impact of labor combination on people.

The wife of the factory director's assistant was eliminated

At the end of last year, Pingdu Chemical Factory implemented labor optimization. The original six female chemists in the chemical analysis room were reduced to four, leaving four and eliminating two. Who would stay and who would go?

Some speculated that Wang Xiuxiang would definitely not be eliminated, as she had a powerful backer—her husband was the newly appointed factory director's assistant, a deputy factory-level cadre. Even if they didn't consider the monk, they would consider the Buddha, and the chemical analysis room would have to consider Wang Xiuxiang first.

However, the factory took the unprecedented step of using an exam to select the best chemists. Wang Xiuxiang ranked fifth out of the six chemists and was eliminated. She didn't want this to be true, but she couldn't avoid reality. Her heart felt like a pot of mixed flavors had been overturned, and she cried bitterly in public.

Wang Xiuxiang's heart was deeply shaken. Previously, she was proud of having a good job, decent professional skills, and a husband who was a cadre in the same factory, like falling into a comfortable nest. Labor optimization made people feel the crisis of their profession, and relationships were no longer reliable. Only real skills could stand firm in society.

Wang Xiuxiang attended the factory's surplus personnel training class. A week later, she was assigned to work as a weighing worker. She cherished her new job, not afraid of dirt or hard work, working diligently from early morning to late night. The masses praised Wang Xiuxiang for becoming a new person.

Wang Xiuxiang loved her job as a chemist. She believed that one combination would not determine her life. She was only 30 years old and still had time to learn and improve. Now she uses her spare time to study the knowledge of drug analysis and formulation, asking her husband, who has expertise, for advice on things she doesn't understand. Her life and work are more fulfilling than ever.

The "Shame-Washing Class" of seven men

On April 15, 1988, Qingdao Radio Factory, which was on the verge of bankruptcy with debts of 15 million yuan, was officially merged with Qingdao Television Factory and renamed Qingdao Television Factory Radio Division. The next day, the factory seized the opportunity to implement labor optimization from top to bottom.

The enterprise was merged, and many workers felt like they had become slaves of a dying factory. Labor optimization immediately reduced 270 cadres and workers, with 90 people sent to the labor service company to find other jobs. The job that was once easily obtained suddenly became valuable. The workers who were eliminated were eager for a new job, no matter how bad the conditions were, they vowed to do it well.

Workers Li Baoxin and mid-level cadre Zang Guangxing were eliminated. They were not willing to be silent and spotted the idle equipment in the plastic workshop, planning to find a few people to start the machines and make a living with their own hands. They found Shi Jianzheng, Ding Hongfu, Liu Debiao, Tian Yong, and Xue Zhenglin from various workshops to discuss, and they agreed immediately. These seven men who were eliminated named their self-organized team the "Shame-Washing Class." They said, "A factory of over 1,000 people with debts of over 10 million yuan, we have become millionaires in debt, this is the shame on our workers' hearts. We will wash away the shame with the sweat of our labor."

The plastic shells used in the production of television sets were previously transported to another place for crushing and processing before being brought back to the factory, wasting time, labor, and money. Now, these seven people took on this task. This is the dirtiest and hardest work in the radio division, with loud noise and a lot of dust, but they work with great enthusiasm. Since June, they have processed 300 tons and earned 100,000 yuan.

She finds her position again

Zhong Hua, a female worker in her late twenties, originally worked in the sofa assembly team of the artificial board factory's wooden product division. Her skill in wrapping sofas was unmatched in the team. Zhong Hua was willing to help others and worked efficiently. The leaders of the factory were happy to find Zhong Hua to process sofas, and she was busy all day.

Making sofas created a good impression, and in 1981, she was transferred to the propaganda department. Zhong Hua only had a junior high school education, and writing and speaking were not her strengths. She had to find a suitable position and was arranged to be a newspaper distributor. This job was much easier than wrapping sofas, but Zhong Hua often felt bored.

Labor optimization eliminated Zhong Hua along with 84 cadres from the department, and she was sent to the decorative board division to be a pasting worker. At first, Zhong Hua was very unhappy and couldn't understand it, but later she made up her mind to start over and be a good worker, letting people see that Zhong Hua is still the Zhong Hua of old.

Pasting is a key process in the production of plywood. The dexterous Zhong Hua quickly mastered the technology after a short training period. The plywood she pasted was both smooth and beautiful. After working for more than two months, she became the top producer in terms of both quantity and quality. Zhong Hua found her position again and won the praise of the masses with her solid work results.

The division leaders valued Zhong Hua's strengths and let her be a quality inspector for the shift, representing the division to oversee the quality of the first shift's products. Whether it was attendance statistics, quality inspection, or ideological work, she was enthusiastic about doing it, and she also did good deeds for workers in difficulty, becoming a backbone in the team.

　　心态，在竞争中平衡
    新华社记者  张荣大
    “劳动组合是一把火，烧着了你，烧着了我，也烧着了大家伙；
    “不怨你，不怨我，就是因为人浮于事非改不可！”
    这首出自青岛工人之口的歌谣，道出了劳动组合给人们心理带来的猛烈撞击。
    　　　　厂长助理的妻子落选后
    平度化工厂去年底实行优化劳动组合。化验室原有六名女化验员，定编四人，留四下二，究竟谁留谁下呢？
    有人猜测，王秀香肯定组合不下来，人家有靠山，丈夫是新聘任的厂长助理，副厂级干部，不看僧面看佛面，化验室留一个人也得优先考虑王秀香。
    然而，工厂破天荒采取考试的办法择优留用化验员。王秀香在六名化验员中成绩名列第五，落选了。她不希望这是真的，但又无法回避现实，心里像打翻了五味瓶，当众痛哭了一场。
    王秀香的心底产生了强烈震荡，以往沾沾自喜于有个好工作，业务水平还过得去，丈夫又在同一个工厂当干部，就像掉进了安乐窝。优化劳动组合让人尝到了职业危机感，关系靠不住了，只有靠真本事才可立足于社会。
    王秀香参加了厂内富余人员学习班。一个星期之后，她被组合干上了过磅工。她非常珍惜新的工作，不怕脏，不怕累，起早贪黑地工作，群众夸王秀香变了一个人。
    王秀香热爱化验员工作，她相信不会一次组合定终身，自己才３０岁，求知上进来得及。现在她利用业余时间钻研药品分析和配制的知识，不明白的问题向学有专长的丈夫请教，生活和工作比以往更充实了。
    　　　　七条汉子组成的“洗耻班”
    １９８８年４月１５日，负债１５００万元而濒临倒闭的青岛无线电厂，被青岛电视机厂正式兼并，改名为青岛电视机厂无线电分厂。第二天，工厂趁热打铁，自上而下全面开始实行优化劳动组合。
    企业被兼并，许多职工大有沦为亡厂奴之感，优化劳动组合又一下子精简下来干部和工人２７０人，有９０人到了劳动服务公司另谋生路。原来轻易得到的工作突然失掉才倍感珍贵。被组合下来的职工，渴望有一个新的工作，哪怕条件不如过去也发誓要干好。
    工人李保新、中层干部臧广兴被组合下来了。他俩不甘心沉默，瞅准了塑料车间闲置多年的几台设备，打算联络几个人把机器开动起来，凭自己的双手挣饭吃。他们找到从各车间组合下来的史建政、丁洪福、刘德亮、田勇、胥正林商议，一拍即合。这七个被组合下来的汉子为自发组合的班组起了个名字——“洗耻班”。他们说，１０００多人的工厂负债１０００多万元，我们成了负债万元户，这是压在我们工人心头上的耻辱。我们要用劳动的汗水洗刷掉耻辱。
    电视机厂生产塑料外壳用的下脚料，过去要运到外地粉碎加工后再拉回工厂用，费时费工费钱。现在他们七个人把这活包揽下来。这是无线电分厂最脏最累的活，噪音大，粉尘多，可他们干得满来劲儿。从６月份以来，已加工了３００吨，挣了１万元。
    　　　　她重新寻找自己的位置
    不足三十岁的女工仲华，原在青岛人造板厂木制品分厂沙发组当工人，她包沙发的手艺在组里首屈一指。仲华肯帮助人，干活利落，工厂的头头脑脑都乐意找仲华加工沙发，每天忙得不可开交。
    打沙发打出了好印象，１９８１年她被调进了宣传科。仲华只有初中文化程度，写与说不是她的特长，只好因人设事，安排她干报刊发行员。这工作比起打沙发来可是轻松多了，可仲华常常闲得发慌。
    优化组合把仲华同８４名干部一起从科室精简下来，她下到装饰板分厂当了粘贴工。起先，仲华满肚子不痛快，想不通，后来，她还是下了决心，重打锣鼓另开戏，当个好工人，让人们瞧瞧，仲华还是当年的仲华。
    粘贴是生产胶合板的关键工序。心灵手巧的仲华经过短时间培训，很快掌握了技术，她粘贴出的胶合板既平滑又美观，干了两个多月就成了全班产量质量的尖子。仲华重新找到了自己的位置，用实实在在的劳动成果，赢得了群众的赞扬。
    分厂领导重视发挥仲华的长处，又让她当了跟班质量检验员，代表分厂抓甲班产品质量。无论是考勤统计，质量检查，还是思想工作，她都热心去做，还为有困难的职工办好事，在班组中成了骨干。
