Gorbachev Urges Soviet People Not to Just Pressure Leaders, but to Push for Reform

	New China News Agency, Moscow, February 20 - Soviet leader Gorbachev said on February 20 during a meeting with the masses in Kiev, the capital of Ukraine, that reform is related to the fate of the party and the state. He urged people "not to just pressure the leaders, but to push for reform!"

	Gorbachev arrived in Kiev on February 20 to inspect work. The Soviet Central Television reported his activities in the "Time" program that evening.

	On his way from the Kiev airport to the city center, Gorbachev got off the car to meet with citizens gathered on the streets and squares, encouraging them for the reform. He pointed out that although there are many difficulties and the progress is slow, the reform is advancing. Now everything depends on the people themselves, and difficulties can be overcome.

	When discussing agricultural issues with the masses, Gorbachev said that as long as agriculture can be revitalized, individual labor, collective contracting, leasing, and family farms, all forms can be used. At the same time, he emphasized the need to improve the production and living conditions in rural areas.

	When the masses expressed concern that price reforms would lower living standards, the General Secretary of the CPSU replied: "Don't worry, if we reform, we should discuss it with the whole nation. If the people oppose it, the prices will not change. The key is to increase production and make the market full of popular goods, then we can talk about lowering prices."

	That afternoon, Gorbachev told researchers at the Materials Science Research Institute that technology should drive economic reform and economic development together. If the Soviet Union misses another 5 to 7 years in the new technological revolution, it will fall behind the world.

　　戈尔巴乔夫要求苏联人民
    勿只对领导施压  要往改革上使劲
    新华社莫斯科２月２０日电  苏领导人戈尔巴乔夫２０日在乌克兰首都基辅会见群众时说，改革关系到党和国家的命运，他要求人们“不要光对领导施加压力，而要往改革上使劲！”
    戈尔巴乔夫是２０日到达基辅视察工作的。苏联中央电视台在当天晚上的“时代”节目中报道了他的活动。
    戈尔巴乔夫在基辅机场到市中心的途中，下车会见聚集在街头和广场上的市民，为改革鼓劲。他指出，虽说困难重重，步履艰难，但改革在前进，现在一切都取决于人民自己，困难是可以克服的。
    戈尔巴乔夫在同群众讨论农业问题时说，只要能振兴农业，个体劳动、集体承包、租赁、家庭农场，一切形式都可以运用。同时，他强调要改善农村的生产和生活条件。
    当群众表示担心价格改革会降低生活水平时，苏共中央总书记回答：放心吧，要改就要全民讨论，如果人民反对，价格就不动。关键是要增产，使市场充满畅销品，才能谈得上降低物价。
    当天下午，戈尔巴乔夫在参观材料学研究所时对科研人员说，科技应同经济改革一起推动经济发展。苏联在新技术革命上再放过５至７年，就会落后于世界。
