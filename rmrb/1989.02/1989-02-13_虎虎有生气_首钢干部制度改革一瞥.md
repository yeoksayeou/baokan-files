Title: Full of Vitality – A Glimpse into the Reform of Cadres at Capital Steel

In society, especially in the capital Beijing, there are two diametrically opposed views on the cadre system at Capital Steel:

One view is: “Capital Steel changes its cadres too frequently, too often, like a revolving door!” “Capital Steel is too strict and harsh in disciplining cadres, there doesn’t seem to be much scientific basis!” “Capital Steel acts on its own, innovates, and arbitrarily sets standards for selecting and using cadres!”

The other view is: “Cadres at Capital Steel can be promoted and demoted, and they can be demoted and then promoted again. Moreover, they have achieved promotions with salary increases and demotions with salary decreases, which is impossible elsewhere!” “If a leading cadre fails to complete tasks in three months or fails to open up a situation in six months, they are considered unqualified and should be adjusted. Capital Steel dares to do this, that’s really something!” “Capital Steel has abolished the distinction between workers and staff. As long as you pass the exam and assessment, even workers can become cadres or even factory directors. This reform is completely in line with the general direction!”

Which view is correct? After in-depth interviews and personal experience, the scales of reason tilt towards the latter view.

		Removing the “Iron Chair”

In late March 1987, the Party Committee Organization Department and the Party Discipline Inspection Commission of Capital Steel received a letter from the masses and an oral report from the disciplinary inspection officer of the Medium Plate Rolling Mill, stating that the mill was on the verge of failing to complete the production task for three consecutive months. The reason was that the leadership team was not united, and the internal contract system was not implemented; moreover, they lacked the confidence to turn the situation around and could no longer lead the workers forward; they requested the company to send someone to investigate and adjust the unqualified cadres. After a detailed investigation by the company's organizational department, the leadership team of the mill was significantly adjusted at the end of April, leaving only the chairman of the trade union and the chief engineer out of the seven mill-level cadres. The workers of the entire mill were overjoyed and their enthusiasm doubled. The new team took office in the same month and completed the monthly production plan, and by the end of the year, not only did they make up for the shortfall of the previous four months, but they also exceeded the annual task.

Similar examples are numerous in the process of Capital Steel's reform. This is because, after the enterprise implemented the “incremental profit turnover contract,” it embarked on the path of self-management, self-profit, and self-development. The goal of increasing profits by 20% each year requires every cadre to “climb the hill like nine oxen—everyone contributes.” Those who cannot lead the workers to complete the contract, guarantee, and key tasks are no longer allowed to “sit on the toilet without doing anything.” They naturally have to be removed from their leadership positions. This is called “breaking the big pot of food” and also removing the “iron chair.” Since 1979, Capital Steel has promoted 672 factory and department-level cadres and demoted 555; promoted more than 2,500 section-level cadres and demoted 1,700. However, the vast majority of those who were removed and demoted did not feel “ashamed to show their faces,” because they all knew: as long as they did not give up on themselves and throw in the towel, but worked actively and achieved results, they still had the opportunity to “rise again.”

Is this true? The comrades from the Party Committee Organization Department of Capital Steel told the reporter: Among the current factory and department-level cadres, there are 29 comrades who were promoted again after being removed and demoted. They performed quite well after being “reinstated.”

		Leveling the “Starting Line”

Capital Steel Company, with more than 100,000 employees and dozens of factory and department-level units, almost every ten days or every month has cadre appointments, promotions, and demotions. However, in the spring of 1988, two newly appointed cadres, due to the continuous reports in the *Capital Steel News*, attracted the widespread attention, deep reflection, and strong response of Capital Steel people.

One is Zhao Shen, the 38-year-old director of the Elevator Factory. This former soldier of the Heilongjiang Production and Construction Corps was originally a worker in a collective-owned unit under the Capital Steel Strip Mill. On December 18, 1987, he saw the company's public notice for the open examination of the director of the Elevator Factory in the *Capital Steel News*, and boldly applied. With his rich experience and management experience in collective units, he had a clear understanding of the problems and revitalization methods of the Elevator Factory, and was thorough in his thinking. Therefore, he ranked first among the 21 applicants. On January 22, Capital Steel officially announced his appointment, making him the first person in all of Capital Steel to become a factory director through “double examinations” (exams and assessments).

The other is Lei Zhuo, who is 30 years old. After graduating from high school, he went to work in the countryside. In 1978, he became a wire drawing worker at the Wire Mill, and later became a warehouse keeper. Since 1981, he has participated in correspondence university studies, and after five years, he obtained a bachelor's degree in enterprise management, and at the same time, he mastered the skills of reading, writing, listening, and speaking English. Later, after rigorous written exams, interviews, and assessments, he became one of the 41 students in the first batch of Capital Steel's English reinforcement training class. Soon after the training class ended last year on April 25, this ordinary worker who had been promoted just four months earlier boarded a plane with his passport, becoming the first batch of full-time foreign trade cadres stationed abroad by Capital Steel Company.

Since the reform, Capital Steel, under the general premise of the cadres being “revolutionary, knowledgeable, specialized, and young” proposed by the central authorities, has formulated specific principles, standards, and measures for selecting and using talents from the actual situation. They adhere to the idea of “times make heroes” and “within a hundred steps, there must be fragrant grass,” believing that talents will emerge in the process of reform. They advocate using the long to cover the short, not demanding perfection; having education but not relying solely on education, emphasizing real talent; having steps but not relying solely on steps, truly making outstanding talents stand out; valuing ability over seniority, boldly promoting young people; and allowing talents to find their place and display their talents as much as possible. They also changed the single reliance on organizational department personnel to “discover talents” method of selecting cadres, and the company's staff and worker representative congress passed the “Regulations on the Examination and Assessment of Leading Cadres,” which introduced a talent competition mechanism, embodied democratization, openness, and scientification, and put all employees and workers on the same “starting line”—whether you are male or female, a cadre or a worker...

Since the “double examination regulations” were announced and the “double examination committee” was established in October 1987, more than 4,990 employees have participated in various professional examinations for selecting cadres. After being screened through examinations and assessments, more than 600 people have taken up various leadership positions, including more than 100 who have taken up factory and department-level leadership positions. The aforementioned Zhao Shen and Lei Zhuo are just representatives of them...

　　虎虎有生气
　　——首钢干部制度改革一瞥
    本报记者  江世杰
    社会上，特别是在首都北京，上上下下对首钢的干部制度存在着两种截然不同的议论：
    一种意见认为：“首钢的干部换得太多了，太勤了，走马灯似的！”“首钢处分干部太严、太狠，看不出有多少科学性！”“首钢自作主张，标新立异，擅自制订选拔、使用干部的标准！”
    另一种意见认为：“首钢的干部能上能下，能下能上，而且作到了提职提薪，降职降薪，这在别处哪有可能？”“领导干部３个月完不成任务或者６个月打不开局面，就是不称职，就要被调整。首钢敢这样做，真不简单！”“首钢取消工人和职员的界限，只要你参加考试、考核合格，工人也能当干部甚至当厂长，这样的改革完全符合大方向！”
    两种看法孰是孰非？记者在深入采访并亲身感受以后，理性的天平偏向了后一种意见。
    　　　　搬掉了“铁交椅”
    １９８７年３月底，首钢党委组织部和党的纪律检查委员会，分别收到了中型轧钢厂群众的一封来信和厂纪检员的口头反映，说该厂眼看连续３个月完不成生产任务，原因是厂领导班子不团结，内部承包制不落实；而且他们缺乏扭转局面的信心，已经不能带领职工继续前进；要求公司派人下来调查，对不称职的干部进行调整。公司组织部门经过详细的考察之后，４月底对该厂领导班子作了大调整，７名厂级干部中，只留下工会主席和主任工程师２人。全厂职工欢欣鼓舞，干劲倍增，新班子上任的当月就完成了月生产计划，到年底不仅追补上前４个月的亏产部分，而且还超额完成了全年任务。
    类似这样的事例，在首钢改革过程中多得很。这是因为，企业实行“上交利润递增包干”以后，走上了自主经营、自负盈亏、自我发展之路。全公司每年实现利润必须递增２０％这个目标，要求每个干部必须“九牛爬坡——个个出力”。那些不能带领职工完成包、保、核任务的干部，想继续“占着茅坑不拉屎”是不行的，他们理所当然地要被从领导岗位上调下去。这就叫“大锅饭”打破了之后，也必须搬掉“铁交椅”。１９７９年以来，首钢共提拔厂处级干部６７２人，调下５５５人；提拔科级干部２５００多人，调下１７００多人。但是，绝大多数被免职降级的干部，没有“无脸见人”的感觉，因为他们都清楚：只要自己不自暴自弃、破罐破摔，而是积极工作，做出成绩，还有可能“东山再起”的。
    这是真的？首钢党委组织部的同志告诉记者：在现正任职的厂处级干部中，就有２９名同志是被免职降级后又重新提拔起来的。他们在“官复原职”以后，大多干得比较出色。
    　　　　统一了“起跑线”
    拥有１０多万人和几十个厂处级单位的首钢公司，几乎每旬每月都有干部任免、升降。然而，在１９８８年的春天，有两个新任干部因《首钢报》的连续报道，引起了首钢人的普遍关注、深刻思索和强烈反响。
    一个是电梯厂３８岁的厂长赵申。这位当年的黑龙江生产建设兵团战士，原来是首钢带钢厂所属的一个集体所有制单位的职工。１９８７年１２月１８日，他在《首钢报》上看到公司公开招考电梯厂厂长的公告，就奋然报名应考。凭着他丰富的阅历和管理集体单位的经验，对电梯厂存在的问题和振兴的办法，看得准确，想得周全，因而在２１名应考者的角逐中名列榜首。１月２２日，首钢正式宣布对他的任命，使他一举成为全首钢通过“双考”（考试、考核）走上厂长岗位的第一人。
    另一位是３０岁的雷戍。他高中毕业后到农村劳动，１９７８年到钢丝厂当拔丝工人，以后又当仓库保管工。从１９８１年起他参加了函授大学学习，５年后获得了企业管理专业的毕业文凭，同时还掌握了英语读、写、听、说的本领。以后，经过严格的笔试、面试和考察，他成了首钢第一个外语强化训练班４１名学员之一。在训练班结束不久后的去年４月２５日，这个４个月前的普通工人，就怀揣出国护照登上飞机，成了首钢公司第一批常驻国外的专职外贸干部。
    改革以来，首钢在中央提出的干部“革命化、知识化、专业化、年轻化”这个总前提下，从实际出发制订了选拔、使用人才的具体原则、标准和措施。他们坚持“时势造英雄”、“百步之内，必有芳草”的观点，认为在改革过程中必然人才辈出。他们主张用长容短，不求全责备；有学历但不唯学历，注重真才实学；有台阶但不唯台阶，真正使拔尖人才脱颖而出；唯才干不唯资历，大胆起用青年人；尽可能让人才各得其所，各展其才。他们还改变单纯依靠组织部门工作人员“伯乐相马”式的选拔干部方法，由公司职代会通过了“领导干部选拔考试考核条例”，这个条例引进了人才竞争机制，体现了民主化、公开化和科学化，使全体职员、工人处在同一个“起跑线”上——不论你是男是女，是干部或是工人……
    自１９８７年１０月“双考条例”公布和“双考委员会”成立以来，已有４９９０多名职工参加了选拔干部的各种专业考试。经过考试、考核的筛选，６００多人走上了各级领导岗位，其中走上厂处级领导岗位的就有１００多人。前面述及的赵申、雷戍，只是他们中间的代表而已……
