A batch of private joint-stock enterprises in Liuyi Town, Yuhuan County, Zhejiang Province, recently moved from cramped residential houses into standard factory buildings, expanding their production and business scale. This is part of Yuhuan County's plan to "establish industrial parks and guide family-based industries out of the home."

By January this year, the county had built standard factory buildings in eight towns, including Hongqiao, Baixiang, and Huanghua.

It is reported that currently, Yuhuan County has 2,300 private joint-stock enterprises, with their output value accounting for 40% of the county's township industrial output value, and the taxes they pay accounting for nearly half of the county's township enterprises. However, most of these enterprises have long been cramped in narrow residential houses for production.

The "industrial park" plan was proposed to address the above problems. The plan includes: unified application for industrial land by enterprises, unified planning and land acquisition by towns, construction of factory buildings, and after completion, collective ownership, with private enterprises only needing to pay a certain amount of rent and management fees. Since the implementation of this work in 1988, it has had a significant effect on improving enterprise operations, upgrading quality, and increasing output.

- Enterprise economic benefits have improved. Liuyi Electronic Instrument Factory is a small factory founded by a few people. Due to its cramped site, its output value has been stagnant at 300,000 to 400,000 yuan for several years. After moving into the standard factory building, the production scale expanded, and the output value exceeded 1 million yuan in 1988.

- Town construction has been reasonably planned and laid out, saving a large amount of land. Industrial parks generally implement the policy of "multi-story factory buildings with shared public facilities," which can save land compared to individual enterprises building their own factories.

- Environmental pollution has been effectively treated. Many electroplating factories scattered in various places in Liuyi Town have long had unresolved sewage discharge problems. By establishing an industrial park, 15 electroplating factories were concentrated, and pollution was treated uniformly, solving the problem.

### 浙江乐清县加快工业小区建设  为私营企业提供良好生产环境

　　浙江乐清县加快工业小区建设   
    为私营企业提供良好生产环境
    本报讯  浙江省乐清县柳市镇的一批私营合股企业最近从简陋的民宅搬进了标准厂房，扩大了生产和经营规模。这是乐清县实施“建立工业小区，引导家庭工业走出家庭”计划的一部分。
    到今年１月份，这个县已在虹桥、白象、黄华等８个集镇兴建了标准厂房。
    据介绍，目前乐清县私营股份企业达２３００家，产值占全县乡镇工业产值的４０％，上交税金几乎占全县乡镇企业的一半。然而，这些企业绝大部分长期拥挤在狭窄的民房中从事生产。
    “工业小区”计划正是针对上述问题提出来的。这个计划包括：企业统一申报工业用地，乡镇统一规划、统一征地，建造厂房，建成后为集体所有，私营企业只需交纳一定的房屋租金和管理费。这一工作从１９８８年实施以来，对企业改善经营，上等级、上质量产生了明显效果。
    ——企业经济效益提高。柳市电子仪表厂是一家几人合资创办的小厂，场地狭窄，几年来产值一直在３０万至４０万元徘徊。搬进标准厂房后，生产规模扩大了，１９８８年产值突破百万元。
    ——乡镇建设得到合理规划布局，节省了大量土地。工业小区普遍实行“多层厂房分层使用，公用设施集中共享”的政策，与单个企业独立建厂相比，可节省土地。
    ——环境污染得到有效治理。柳市镇众多分散于各处的电镀厂，排污问题一直无法解决，通过建立工业小区，把１５家电镀厂集中起来，统一治污，问题迎刃而解。
