He is Willing to Take on the "Toughest" Job

Currently, one of the most challenging tasks in rural areas is family planning. However, Li Lihua, the family planning assistant in Kuanghe Township of our county, is willing to take on this toughest job.

Li Lihua, who is 36 years old this year, has been engaged in family planning work for 14 years. In the three years he has worked as the family planning assistant in Kuanghe Township, he has visited all 16 villages and done family planning work for over 800 households. He has been named an advanced worker at both the county and township levels multiple times and has recently been commended by the provincial government.

Willing to Stay for the Work

In the autumn of 1985, Li Lihua was transferred from the Bailian Management Area of our county to the Kuanghe Township Family Planning Office. By then, he had already worked in family planning for 11 years. Over the 11 years, the county's leaders in charge of this work had changed several times, but he continued to diligently do his job. In the second half of 1987, the county Family Planning Commission planned to transfer him to the city, but since Kuanghe Township needed him, the transfer did not happen. He neither complained nor slacked off, continuing to work diligently. In September 1988, the township party committee planned to assign him to other work. Li Lihua thought that if the township's leaders in charge of family planning had just changed, and if his work was also changed, the new leaders might not be familiar with the work, which could affect the township's family planning work. Therefore, he voluntarily expressed to the township party committee his willingness to continue in his original position.

Daring to Confront "Hard Nuts" and Winning Their Hearts

In the first half of 1986, a villager in Citaohe Village already had two children, and his wife was pregnant again. Li Lihua and the village leaders visited his home multiple times to persuade them to take remedial measures, but were repeatedly rejected. The villager even threatened, "If Li Lihua dares to come into my house again, I'll stab him with a knife!" Li Lihua was not deterred and continued to visit the home to do persuasive work. Through calm and reasonable explanations, the villager's thoughts were finally swayed. He held Li Lihua's hand and said, "I am convinced by you!" The villager quickly implemented the remedial measures. To do a good job in the ideological work of family planning objects, sometimes he would work from morning to night, explaining the national situation and the benefits of family planning to the relevant personnel while hungry. Therefore, the family planning work in this township has been very effective.

Taking Responsibility to Solve Problems for the Masses

In May 1988, a woman of childbearing age in the ninth group of Shijiafan Village had bleeding after a tubal ligation. Li Lihua promptly arranged for village cadres to send her to the hospital for treatment, reimbursing all her medical and living expenses, and personally finding the township civil affairs officer to provide her family with some relief funds. A woman in Kuanghe Village had complications after an induced abortion, and Li Lihua, upon learning this, immediately arranged for her to be hospitalized. During her hospitalization, Li Lihua visited her several times and brought her nutritional supplies. When the woman recovered and was discharged from the hospital, she had tears in her eyes and said to Li Lihua, "Assistant Li, you are truly a caring official for us!"

To commend Li Lihua's achievements, the township awarded him 130 yuan, but he used all the money to care for family planning objects.

### 他愿做“最难”的工作

　　他愿做“最难”的工作
    当前，农村最难开展的工作之一，是计划生育。可是，我县匡河乡计划生育助理李利华，却愿意做这项最难做的工作。
    今年３６岁的李利华，先后做了１４年的计划生育工作。在匡河乡担任计划生育助理的３年时间里，他跑遍了全乡１６个村，登门做过８００多户计划生育对象的工作。他多次被评为县、乡两级先进工作者，最近又受到省政府的表彰。
    　　　　为了工作愿继续留任
    １９８５年秋，李利华从我县白莲管理区调到匡河乡计划生育办公室时，他已搞了１１年计划生育工作。１１年来，全县各乡分管这项工作的领导人换了一届又一届，而他仍然兢兢业业地做着这项工作。１９８７年下半年，县计划生育委员会准备调他进城，由于匡河乡需要他，没有调成。他一不埋怨，二不松劲，照样在那里安心工作。１９８８年９月，乡党委准备安排他分管其它工作，李利华想，乡里分管计划生育的领导人刚刚变动，如果自己的工作也调换了，新上任的领导人摸不清工作头绪，乡里的计划生育工作可能会受到影响。于是，他主动向乡党委表示，愿意继续担任原职。
        　　敢于碰硬“钉子户”心服
    １９８６年上半年，祠堂河村有一个村民已有两个孩子，他的妻子又怀孕了。李利华和乡村领导人多次上门做工作，要他们采取补救措施，却屡遭拒绝。这个村民还扬言：“李利华再敢进我家的门，我就一刀捅了他！”李利华没有被吓退，仍坚持上门做工作，通过心平气和地讲道理，这个村民的思想终于被说通了，他拉着李利华的手说：“我算服了你！”这个村民很快落实了补救措施。为了做好计划生育对象的思想工作，有时，他从上午忙到下午，从下午忙到夜深，饿着肚子，向有关人员讲明国情，宣传计划生育的好处。因此，这个乡计划生育工作的效果很突出。
    　　    负责到底为群众解难
    １９８８年５月，施家畈村九组一位育龄妇女结扎后，伤口出血。李利华及时安排村干部把她送进医院治疗，不仅报销了她的全部医药费和住院生活费，还亲自找乡民政干事，给她家一部分照顾款。匡河村有位妇女引产后留下后遗症，李利华得知后，立即把她安排住进了医院。住院期间，李利华几次前往探望，还给她送去营养品。那位妇女恢复健康出院时，双眼噙着泪对李利华说：“李助理，你这样的干部，真是我们的贴心人啊！”
    为了表彰李利华的工作成就，乡里奖给他１３０元，而他却把这些钱都用于对计划生育对象的照顾上。
