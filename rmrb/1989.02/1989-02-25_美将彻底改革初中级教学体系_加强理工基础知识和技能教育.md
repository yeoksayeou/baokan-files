The U.S. to Overhaul Elementary and Middle School Education System

Strengthen Basic Knowledge and Skills in Science and Technology

WASHINGTON, Feb. 23 (Xinhua) -- Some of the largest and most prestigious scientific institutions in the United States announced today a "most ambitious" educational plan aimed at reforming the entire educational system from kindergarten to high school to overcome the current widespread phenomenon of weak science and technology foundations among American students.

This plan was jointly announced by the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the National Science Foundation, International Business Machines Corporation, the Carnegie Corporation, and representatives from some school districts. According to reports, the plan will be completed in three stages, with the first stage, which began in 1985, lasting four years. A group of educational experts outlined in a 100-page proposal the various knowledge and skills that all students must acquire.

The second stage, which is now beginning, will involve experiments in about a dozen school districts in five states to turn the ideas of the first stage into reality. The goal is to provide new curricula, new textbooks, and learning schedules as models for nationwide educational reform. This stage will also take four years. The final stage will be the implementation of the results of the previous stage through the joint efforts of national scientific organizations, educational institutions, and organizations.

The plan believes that currently, most Americans are scientifically illiterate, and the science and technology foundations of American students are among the worst in the world. Another person in charge of the plan, Beck, said that with the current skill level of the new workforce, the United States will not be able to achieve industrial progress in the future.

The Washington Post said that this educational reform plan is the largest since the late 1950s.

　　美将彻底改革初中级教学体系
    加强理工基础知识和技能教育
    本报华盛顿２月２３日电  记者仓立德报道：美国一些全国最大、最负盛名的科学机构今天宣布了一项“最雄心勃勃”的教育计划，旨在改革整个幼儿园至高中的教学体系，克服目前美国学生理工科知识基础薄弱的普遍现象。
    这项计划是由美国促进科学协会、全国科学基金会、国际商用机器公司、卡内基公司及一些学区的代表联合公布的。据报道，该计划分３个阶段完成，费时４年的第一阶段自１９８５年即已开始。一批教育专家在１００页构想中，为所有学生规定出必须获得的各种知识和技能。
    目前开始的第二阶段是在５个州的十几个学区中开展试验，将第一阶段的设想变为现实。目的是为全国推行教学体系改革提供新课程、新教科书及学习进度的范本。这个阶段也需时４年。最后一个阶段是通过全国科学团体、教育组织及机构的共同努力，落实上个阶段的实验结果。
    这项计划认为，目前大部分美国人是科盲，美国学生的理工科知识基础处于全世界最差之列。该计划另一位负责人贝克说，以新劳动力目前的技能水平，美国将来不能获得工业进步。
    《华盛顿邮报》说，这项教育改革计划是自５０年代末以来规模最大的。
