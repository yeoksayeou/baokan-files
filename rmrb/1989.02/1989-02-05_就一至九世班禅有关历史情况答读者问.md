Dear Editor,

We were deeply saddened to learn of the sudden passing of Panchen Erdeni Qojye Gyatso, Vice Chairman. The passing of Panchen Rinpoche is a great loss to our country.

It is reported that this master is the Tenth Panchen Lama, but we know nothing about the previous nine Panchen Lamas. We hope you can introduce some knowledge about this aspect.

	Yours sincerely,
	Several readers from Beijing

Dear Readers,

After receiving your letter inquiring about the background of the first nine Panchen Lamas, we immediately dispatched reporter Wu Changsheng to visit Mr. Ya Hanzhang, a renowned ethnologist and the author of "The Biography of the Dalai Lamas" and "The Biography of the Panchen Erdenis," to provide a brief introduction to the background of the first nine Panchen Lamas.

	—Editor

The First Panchen Khedrup Gelek Pelzang

The First Panchen Lama, Khedrup Gelek Pelzang, was born on the 8th of the fourth month of the Wood Ox year of the Tibetan calendar (1385 AD) in the village of Qiewo in the Lhedang Doxong region of U-Tsang. As a child, he took monastic vows at Sakya Monastery. Later, he became a disciple of Tsongkhapa, the founder of the Gelugpa sect, and became one of Tsongkhapa's important assistants. He served as the third abbot of Ganden Monastery and wrote "The Biography of Tsongkhapa." He passed away on the 21st of the second month of the Earth Horse year of the Tibetan calendar (1438 AD) while serving as the abbot of Ganden Monastery, at the age of 53.

The Second Panchen Sonam Choklang

The Second Panchen Lama, Sonam Choklang, was born on the 10th (or 15th) of the first month of the Earth Sheep year of the Tibetan calendar (1439 AD) in the Ensa region of U-Tsang (present-day Jiangdang District of Shigatse). He passed away on the 25th of the third month of the Wood Mouse year of the Tibetan calendar (1504 AD), at the age of 65. He served as the abbot of Ngamring Monastery and is said to have written many works expounding the Gelugpa teachings.

The Third Panchen Losang Dondrub

The Third Panchen Lama, Losang Dondrub, was born on the 4th of the first month of the Wood Ox year of the Tibetan calendar (1505 AD) in the Ensa region of U-Tsang. He served as the abbot of Ngamring Monastery and passed away on the 23rd of the second month of the Fire Tiger year of the Tibetan calendar (1566 AD), at the age of 61. He traveled extensively in U-Tsang, spreading the Gelugpa teachings, and made significant contributions to the development of the Gelugpa sect in U-Tsang.

The Fourth Panchen Losang Chokyi Gyaltsen

The Fourth Panchen Lama, Losang Chokyi Gyaltsen, was born on the 15th of the fourth month of the Iron Horse year of the Tibetan calendar (1570 AD) in the Langlen Chukar valley of U-Tsang (present-day western Shigatse). At the age of 14, he became the abbot of Ngamring Monastery. In 1586, he received the title of Geshe Lharampa (a high academic degree in the Gelugpa sect) at Tashilhunpo Monastery. In 1601, he became the 16th abbot of Tashilhunpo Monastery. He passed away on the 13th of the second month of the Water Tiger year of the Tibetan calendar (1662 AD), at the age of 92. The Fourth Panchen Lama, Losang Chokyi Gyaltsen, was not only an outstanding religious leader but also a prominent political leader. Together with the Fifth Dalai Lama, he led the suppression of internal unrest and played a crucial role in establishing the Gelugpa sect's dominance in all of Tibet. He and the Dalai Lama sent representatives to establish contact with the newly established central government of the Qing Dynasty, making significant contributions to the maintenance of national unity. In 1645, the leader of the Khoshut Mongols from Xinjiang, Gushri Khan, bestowed the title of "Panchen Bogd" on Losang Chokyi Gyaltsen. "Pan" is short for "Pandita," meaning wisdom in Sanskrit; "chen" is short for "Chinba," meaning great in Tibetan; "Bogd" is a Mongolian term of respect for a wise and brave person. From the Fourth Panchen Lama onwards, the monks of Tashilhunpo Monastery unanimously acknowledged the successive Panchen Lamas as their natural abbots.

The Fifth Panchen Lobzang Yeshe

The Fifth Panchen Lama, Lobzang Yeshe, was born on the 15th of the seventh month of the Water Rabbit year of the Tibetan calendar (1663 AD) in the village of Chucang in the Tobgya valley of U-Tsang. In 1668, he was recognized as the reincarnation of the Fourth Panchen Lama. In 1713, the Kangxi Emperor of the Qing Dynasty conferred the title of "Panchen Erdeni" (meaning "Precious Jewel" in Manchu) on the Fifth Panchen Lama and bestowed a golden seal and a golden certificate. The title of "Panchen" was thus formally established, and it became a custom for successive Panchen Lamas to be recognized by the central government. (Note: Before this, only Gushri Khan had bestowed the title of "Panchen Bogd" on the Fourth Panchen Lama, and the central government had not formally conferred any title. The first four Panchen Lamas were all posthumously recognized.) The Fifth Panchen Lama, Lobzang Yeshe, passed away on the 5th of July 1737 at Tashilhunpo Monastery, at the age of 74.

During his lifetime, Tibet was frequently invaded by foreign powers, and the internal political situation was chaotic. In extremely difficult circumstances, he steadfastly stood on the side of the central government, making unremitting efforts and beneficial contributions to maintain national unity, promote national solidarity, and stabilize the political situation in Tibet.

The Sixth Panchen Padma Yeshe

The Sixth Panchen Lama, Padma Yeshe, was born on the 11th of the eleventh month of the Earth Horse year of the Tibetan calendar (1738 AD) in the village of Zaxi Zekar in the Namling Dzong of U-Tsang. In 1740, with the approval of the Qianlong Emperor of the Qing Dynasty, he was recognized as the reincarnation of the Fifth Panchen Lama. The following year, Qianlong sent officials to Tibet to preside over the enthronement ceremony of the Sixth Panchen Lama. In 1780, the Sixth Panchen Lama personally went to Chengde to celebrate the Qianlong Emperor's birthday. Qianlong specially ordered the construction of the Sumi Fushou Temple in Chengde, modeled after Tashilhunpo Monastery, for the Panchen Lama to reside in. That year, in September, the Panchen Lama returned to Beijing with Qianlong and stayed at the Yellow Temple, where he frequently gave lectures and sermons at places like Yonghe Temple. On the 2nd of November, the Sixth Panchen Lama passed away at the Yellow Temple in Beijing, at the age of 42. The following year, Qianlong sent officials to escort the Panchen Lama's stupa back to Tashilhunpo Monastery. The Sixth Panchen Lama, Padma Yeshe, made active contributions to maintaining national unity and opposing national separatism.

The Seventh Panchen Tenpai Nyima

The Seventh Panchen Lama, Tenpai Nyima, was born on the 8th of the fourth month of the Water Tiger year of the Tibetan calendar (1782 AD) in the village of Jixiong in the Balang Dzong of U-Tsang. That year, the Qianlong Emperor of the Qing Dynasty issued an edict approving the petition of Tashilhunpo Monastery, recognizing Tenpai Nyima as the reincarnation of the Sixth Panchen Lama, and bestowed a khata and a string of prayer beads. From August 1844 to March 1845, he served as the regent of Tibet by imperial decree. On the 14th of the first month of 1853, the Seventh Panchen Lama passed away at Tashilhunpo Monastery, at the age of 71. He made important contributions to opposing foreign aggression and maintaining national unity.

The Eighth Panchen Tenpai Wangchuk

The Eighth Panchen Lama, Tenpai Wangchuk, was born on the 8th of the eighth month of the Wood Rabbit year of the Tibetan calendar (1855 AD) in the village of Zhucang in the Tobgya valley of U-Tsang. In 1857, through the golden urn drawing, he was approved by the Xianfeng Emperor of the Qing Dynasty as the reincarnation of the Seventh Panchen Lama. On the 15th of July 1882, he passed away in his hometown of Tobgya valley, at the age of 27.

The Ninth Panchen Thubten Chökyi Nyima

The Ninth Panchen Lama, Thubten Chökyi Nyima, was born on the 12th of the first month of the Water Sheep year of the Tibetan calendar (1883 AD) in the village of Gaxia in the Tabu region of Ü-Tsang. In 1888, through the golden urn drawing, he was approved by the Guangxu Emperor of the Qing Dynasty as the reincarnation of the Eighth Panchen Lama. On the 1st of December 1937, he passed away at the Jiala Pochang Palace in the Yushu Great Monastery in Qinghai, at the age of 54.

The life of the Ninth Panchen Lama was one of hardship and struggle. He was not only deeply versed in Buddhist studies but also politically mature. In his early years, he led the anti-British struggle with the Thirteenth Dalai Lama. In his later years, he actively participated in the anti-Japanese struggle and was an outstanding anti-imperialist patriot in modern Tibetan history. Due to his disagreements with the Tibetan local government, he left Tibet for the interior in 1923 and lived in exile for 14 years until his passing in 1937. However, he remained steadfast in his struggle to maintain national unity and promote national solidarity.

    编辑同志：
    得知班禅额尔德尼·确吉坚赞副委员长猝然病逝的消息，我们感到十分痛惜。班禅大师的逝世，是我们国家的一个重大损失。
    报道中说这位大师是第十世班禅，而对前九世班禅的情况，我们一无所知。希望您们能介绍一些这方面的知识。
　　　　　　　　　　北京
　几读者北京几读者：
    本报收到你们询问前九世班禅有关情况的来信之后，即派记者吴长生走访《达赖喇嘛传》和《班禅额尔德尼传》两书的作者、著名民族学家牙含章同志，请他把一至九世班禅的有关情况作简要介绍。　　　　
　　　　　——编者
　一世班禅克珠杰
    一世班禅法名克珠杰·格勒巴桑，藏历第六绕迥木牛年（公元１３８５年）４月初８日，生于后藏拉堆多雄地方的切卧村。他幼年在萨迦寺出家，后拜黄教创始人宗喀巴为师，遂成为宗喀巴的重要助手之一，曾担任过甘丹寺第三任池巴（住持），撰写过《宗喀巴传》。藏历第七绕迥土马年（公元１４３８年）２月２１日，克珠杰在甘丹寺池巴任内逝世，享年５３岁。
　二世班禅索南确朗
    二世班禅法名索南确朗，藏历第七绕迥土羊年（公元１４３９年）正月初１０日（又说为１５日）生于后藏恩萨（今日喀则江当区）地方，逝世于藏历第八绕迥木鼠年（公元１５０４年）３月２５日，享年６５岁。他曾任安贡寺池巴，据说有多种阐述黄教教义的著作。
　三世班禅罗桑丹珠
    三世班禅法名罗桑丹珠，藏历第八绕迥木牛年（公元１５０５年）正月初４日，生于后藏恩萨地方，曾任安贡寺池巴，逝世于藏历第九绕迥火虎年（公元１５６６年）２月２３日，享年６１岁。他曾云游后藏各地，宣讲黄教教义，对黄教在后藏的发展，作了一定贡献。
　四世班禅罗桑曲结
    四世班禅法名罗桑曲结，藏历第十绕迥铁马年（公元１５７０年）４月１５日，生于后藏兰伦热布谿卡（今日喀则西）；１４岁时担任安贡寺池巴；１５８６年，在扎什伦布寺获得“柔钦”（黄教创立初期对有学问的喇嘛的一种尊称）学位；１６０１年就任扎什伦布寺第１６任池巴；逝世于藏历第十一绕迥的水虎年（公元１６６２年）２月１３日，享年９２岁。四世班禅罗桑曲结不仅是一位杰出的宗教领袖，也是一位杰出的政治领袖。他与五世达赖一起领导平息内乱，对确立黄教在全藏的统治地位，起了重要作用；他和达赖派遣代表，主动与初建的清朝中央政权联系，对维护祖国统一，作出了重大贡献。１６４５年，由新疆入藏的厄鲁特蒙古和硕特部的首领固始汗赠送罗桑曲结“班禅博克多”尊号。“班”是“班智达”的简称，梵语智慧的意思；“禅”是藏语“钦波”的简称，大的意思；“博克多”，是蒙语，是对睿智英武人物的尊称。从四世班禅起，扎什伦布寺僧众一致承认历世班禅为该寺当然池巴。
　五世班禅罗桑益喜
    五世班禅法名罗桑益喜，藏历第十一绕迥水兔年（公元１６６３年）７月１５日，生于后藏托布加谿卡的出仓村；１６６８年正月，被确认为四世班禅的转世灵童。１７１３年清康熙皇帝册封五世班禅为“班禅额尔德尼”（“额尔德尼”是满语珍宝的意思），并赐金册、金印，“班禅”名号由此正式确立，此后历世班禅转世，必经中央政府册封，亦成为定制（注：在此之前，仅固始汗给四世班禅上过“班禅博克多”的尊号，中央政权未曾正式册封。一至四世班禅都是后人追认的）。１７３７年７月５日，五世班禅逝世于扎什伦布寺，享年７４岁。
    五世班禅罗桑益喜生前，西藏屡遭外族侵扰，内部政局也动乱不已。在极其艰难的环境中，他始终坚定地站在中央政权一边，为维护祖国统一、促进民族团结、稳定西藏政局，作出了不懈的努力和有益的贡献。
　六世班禅巴丹益喜
    六世班禅法名巴丹益喜，藏历第十二绕迥土马年（公元１７３８年）１１月１１日，生于后藏南木林宗札西则谿卡；１７４０年，经清乾隆皇帝批准，被确认为五世班禅的转世灵童。次年，乾隆派员进藏主持了六世班禅的坐床大典。１７８０年，六世班禅亲赴承德为乾隆皇帝祝寿。乾隆特命人仿照扎什伦布寺式样，在承德建造了须弥福寿之庙，让班禅居住。是年９月，班禅随乾隆返京，住黄寺，其间多次到雍和宫等处讲经说法。１１月２日，六世班禅病逝于北京黄寺，享年４２岁。次年，乾隆派人护送班禅灵塔回扎什伦布寺。六世班禅巴丹益喜，为维护祖国统一、反对民族分裂，作出了积极的贡献。
　七世班禅丹白尼玛
    七世班禅法名丹白尼玛，藏历第十三绕迥水虎年（公元１７８２年）４月８日，生于后藏白朗宗吉雄谿卡。当年，清乾隆皇帝降旨批准扎什伦布寺之奏请，确认丹白尼玛为六世班禅转世灵童，并赐哈达一条、宝石念珠一串。１８４４年８月至１８４５年３月，他曾奉旨担任西藏摄政。１８５３年正月１４日，七世班禅逝世于扎什伦布寺，享年７１岁。为反对外敌侵略，维护祖国统一，七世班禅作出了重要贡献。
　八世班禅丹白旺修
    八世班禅法名丹白旺修，藏历第十四绕迥木兔年（公元１８５５年）８月８日，生于后藏托布加谿卡竹仓村；１８５７年８月，经金瓶掣签，清咸丰皇帝批准，被确认为七世班禅转世灵童；１８８２年７月１５日，病逝于故乡托布加谿卡，时年２７岁。
　九世班禅曲吉尼玛
    九世班禅法名曲吉尼玛，藏历第十五绕迥水羊年（公元１８８３年）正月１２日，生于前藏塔布地区噶夏村；１８８８年正月，经金瓶掣签，清光绪皇帝批准，被确认为八世班禅转世灵童；１９３７年１２月１日，逝世于青海玉树大寺甲拉颇章宫，享年５４岁。
    九世班禅的一生，是坎坷的一生，也是斗争的一生。他不仅佛学造诣极深，而且政治上也很成熟。早期，他曾与十三世达赖一起领导了抗英斗争，晚年又积极投身于抗日斗争，是西藏近代史上一位杰出的反帝爱国领袖。由于与西藏地方政府不和，他自１９２３年离藏到内地，直至１９３７年圆寂，过了整整１４年离乡背井的动荡生活，但他始终顽强地为维护祖国统一、促进民族团结而奋斗。
