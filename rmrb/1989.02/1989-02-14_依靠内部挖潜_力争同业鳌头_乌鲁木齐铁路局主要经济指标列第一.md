In the face of the increasingly sharp contradiction between railway transportation volume and capacity, the Urumqi Railway Bureau has adhered to the principle of focusing on tapping potential and expanding capacity, taking the path of expanding production through internal growth, and achieving remarkable results. Last year, the bureau's key economic indicators such as equivalent turnover, passenger and freight volume, transportation revenue, and labor productivity growth rate ranked first among the 12 railway bureaus nationwide.

During the "Seventh Five-Year Plan" period, the state's investment in railway construction was mainly concentrated in the eastern and southern regions, with very little investment in the Urumqi Railway Bureau in the northwest. With the rapid development of Xinjiang's economy, the annual growth rate of outbound goods transported by rail has reached 15.4%, making the already acute contradiction between transportation volume and capacity even more pronounced. Under these circumstances, the Urumqi Railway Bureau, based on its specific conditions, successfully explored a path of expanding production through internal growth.

The bureau started by strengthening transportation organization work, further enhancing the centralized and unified command of transportation production, and striving to improve the fulfillment rate of transportation plans. Under the premise of not significantly increasing transportation production equipment and not substantially raising transportation costs, the bureau fully utilized the organization of cargo flow to load trains, increasing the average net load of each freight car by 1.4 tons compared to the plan, equivalent to saving nearly 10,000 freight cars annually. At the same time, the bureau organized 26,000 express direct trains and overloaded trains, reducing the turnover time of each freight car from 3.25 days to 3.05 days, thereby improving vehicle utilization efficiency. The bureau also adopted measures such as replacing open cars with flat cars, replacing covered cars with open cars, and fully utilizing mixed-type vehicles, transporting an additional 100,000 tons of goods last year. In the face of a significant increase in passenger volume, the bureau added 1,847 passenger cars in the first 10 months of last year, transporting an additional 178,000 passengers.

The Urumqi Railway Bureau, relying on tapping potential and expanding capacity, has made significant contributions to the development of Xinjiang's economy. Last year, it transported 1.02 million tons of salt out of the region, generating 100 million yuan in revenue for the autonomous region. This year, the bureau has taken on the task of transporting 2 million tons of salt out of the region, which is expected to generate 340 million yuan in revenue for the autonomous region. In the past year, the bureau also achieved significant economic benefits, with transportation revenue exceeding 500 million yuan for the first time, realizing a profit of 108 million yuan, and the growth rate of taxes, profits, and enterprise retained earnings all ranking among the top in the national railway system.

　　依靠内部挖潜　力争同业鳌头    
    乌鲁木齐铁路局主要经济指标列第一
    据新华社电  （记者亚力坤、通讯员王留保）在铁路运量与运能的矛盾日益尖锐的情况下，乌鲁木齐铁路局坚持以挖潜扩能为中心，走内涵扩大再生产的道路，取得明显成效。去年全局的换算周转量、客货运量、运输收入和全员劳动生产率等主要指标的增长幅度在全国１２个铁路局中位居第一。
    “七五”期间，国家对铁路建设的投资主要放在华东、华南等地区，地处西北的乌鲁木齐铁路局投资很少。随着新疆经济建设的迅速发展，近年来经由铁路运输的出疆物资年增长率高达１５．４％，使本来已经十分尖锐的运量与运能之间的矛盾更加突出。在这种情况下，乌鲁木齐铁路局从路情、局情出发，成功地摸索出一条走内涵扩大再生产的道路。
    这个铁路局从加强运输组织工作入手，进一步加强运输生产的集中统一指挥，努力提高运输计划的兑现率。在一不大量增添运输生产设备，二不大幅度提高运输成本的前提条件下，充分利用货物流向组织装车，使每辆货车的净载重平均比计划提高１．４吨，相当于全年节约车皮近万辆。同时，组织快运直达列车和超重列车２．６万多列，使每辆货车的周转时间由３．２５天压缩到３．０５天，提高了车辆的运用效率。这个路局还采取了以平板车代替敞车、以敞车代替棚车、充分利用杂型车辆等措施，去年多装运货物１００多万吨。在客运量大幅度增长的情况下，这个局去年前１０个月就加挂客车１８４７辆，多运送旅客１７．８万人。
    乌鲁木齐铁路局依靠挖潜扩能为新疆经济的发展做出了贡献，去年仅外运湖盐就达１０２万吨，为自治区增收１亿元。今年，这个铁路局又接受了自治区外运湖盐２００万吨的任务，将为自治区增收３．４亿元。在过去的一年中，路局也取得了显著的经济效益，运输收入首次突破５亿元，实现利润１．０８亿元，上缴税利和企业留利的增长幅度都名列全路先进水平。
