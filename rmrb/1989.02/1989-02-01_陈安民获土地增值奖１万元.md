Recently, the Upper Village Committee of Niu Du Town in Linyi County, Shanxi Province, awarded 100,000 yuan in land appreciation bonus to fruit orchard contractor Chen Anmin.

Chen Anmin is a farmer from Nanfu Village, Jinjing Township, Yuncheng City. In 1983, he contracted 80 mu of fruit orchard in Upper Village. When he first took over the orchard, it was overgrown with weeds, and the fruit trees were in poor condition, with an annual output value of less than 30 yuan per mu. After contracting, he moved his family to the orchard, dug wells to draw water, and prepared the land for planting. He then hired fruit tree experts to guide pruning, pest control, and fertilization, which quickly improved the condition of the fruit trees. The second year, the orchard entered a high-yield period, and the third year, the output value per mu exceeded 400 yuan. He used most of the income from selling fruits and grains to expand production. Over the five years of contracting, he invested more than 100,000 yuan in the orchard. Now, the orchard has rows of trees, square fields, and a network of ditches. The cadres of Upper Village, after verification, confirmed that Chen Anmin had made significant contributions to improving the land's production conditions during his contract period, with high investment and high output. After discussion among the villagers, it was unanimously agreed to award Chen Anmin a land appreciation bonus of 100,000 yuan.

　　陈安民获土地增值奖１万元
    本报讯  最近，山西省临猗县牛杜镇上庄村委会将１万元土地增值奖金发给果园承包户陈安民。
    陈安民是运城市金井乡南扶村农民。１９８３年，他易地承包了上庄村的８０亩果园。刚承包时，园内杂草丛生，果树长势很差，年亩产值达不到３０元。承包后，他举家迁居果园，打井引水，整地种粮；接着又聘请果树专家，指导剪枝、治虫、施肥，使果树很快变了样，第二年就转入高产期，第三年亩产值突破４００元。他把卖果、粮的收入，绝大部分用于扩大再生产，承包５年间，共向果园投资１０万多元。现在，果园里，树成行，田成方，渠成网。上庄村的干部经过核查，认定陈安民在承包果园期间，投入多，产出高，对改善土地生产条件做出了特殊贡献。经村民讨论，一致同意给陈安民发土地增值奖一万元。
