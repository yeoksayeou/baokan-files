The first snows of the New Year greeted me as I arrived in Hanchang Village, Jingmen City, Hubei. Inside the school, the sound of lectures filled the air as a class on basic population and family planning knowledge was in session.

The village party secretary, Wang Daoyin, explained, “The 360 women of childbearing age in our village are all participating in this study. They are divided into classes based on age: the Adolescent Class, the Marriage and Childbearing Class, and the Middle-Aged Class. Population knowledge and family planning policies and laws are compulsory courses for all classes. Additionally, we offer specialized courses tailored to each group, such as adolescent hygiene, reproductive physiology, prenatal and postnatal care, contraception, and menopausal health.”

We entered the Adolescent Class, where Teacher Yuan Yonglie was lecturing on adolescent hygiene. Below the podium, 38 unmarried girls aged 17 and above were listening attentively.

Topics such as menstruation and vaginal discharge, which were once considered private matters among women, are now openly discussed in class. I intentionally asked the girl sitting next to me, Bear Jiuyu from Group 6, “Do you know the physiological reactions during menstruation?” Bear Jiuyu did not blush but shyly replied, “When menstruation comes, symptoms like breast tenderness, back pain, headaches, and depression are normal. Now, I am no longer anxious about it.”

Science and ignorance are in fierce competition here. The popularization of family planning knowledge has brought these women, once confined to their homes, into the realm of science, allowing them to understand and explore the mysteries of human reproduction.

In Hanchang Village, women have started to take their menstrual pads from under the bed or dark corners and hang them in the sunlight. They know that sunlight contains ultraviolet and infrared rays, which can kill bacteria.

People have begun to understand that consanguineous marriages are a breeding ground for certain genetic diseases. Liu Zuohai from Group 5, who had been close with his cousin since childhood, rationally extinguished the flames of their love.

The young men and women here have also started practicing prenatal education. Guo Hourong, 28, told me that after she became pregnant, her husband went to great lengths to make her happy. He often placed a radio near her belly to play her favorite music and followed the book’s methods to prepare her meals. As a result, her child was fair-skinned, plump, and healthy, earning the admiration of others. “Whose child is strong and intelligent?” The people of Hanchang Village no longer compare who has more or fewer children like Zhang San and Li Si.

The dissemination of population policies and regulations, along with the reality of having fewer but healthier children, has educated the people of Hanchang Village, making them voluntarily comply with the basic national policy of family planning. In the room for women of childbearing age, I saw a series of menstrual cards with names written on them. The women’s director said, “When the time comes, married women of childbearing age will voluntarily report their menstrual cards to the women’s cadres, indicating their pregnancy status. All 302 married women of childbearing age in the village have adopted various contraceptive measures.”

The village head, Xu Zhihua, said, “Family planning is a major challenge in rural work. However, in our village, through popular science education, the relationship between officials and the masses has been adjusted anew, and administrative and economic measures seem unnecessary.”

　　“悄悄话”在这里公开   
     ——荆门市韩场村人口知识教育见闻
    黄锦新
    元旦刚过，一场瑞雪把我迎进湖北荆门市韩场村。学校里，传来琅琅的讲课声，人口与计划生育基础知识教育正在进行。
    村党支部书记王道银介绍说：“在这里参加学习的，有全村３６０名育龄妇女，按年龄组分为青春期班、婚育期班、中年期班。人口知识、计划生育政策法律是各班的公共必修课。另外，根据不同对象开设了青春期卫生、生殖生理、优生优育、避孕节育和更年期保健课。”
    我们走进青春期班，袁用烈老师正在讲青春期卫生课。讲台下，３８名１７岁以上的未婚女青年正听得聚精会神。
    说月经，讲白带……这些农家女人中的私房话、悄悄话，如今也进入课堂。我有意询问了坐在身边的６组女青年熊久玉：“你知道月经期的生理反应吗？”小熊并不脸红，只是腼腆地说：“月经来潮，乳胀，腰酸，头痛抑郁，这不是病。因此，心里再也不紧张了。”
    科学与愚昧正在这里激烈地角逐。计划生育的科普知识，把这些曾被束缚在家庭小天地里的女性引进科学的殿堂，去认识和探索人类自身繁衍的奥秘。
    在韩场村，村妇们开始把月经带从床下草垫中或阴暗角落里拿了出来，并放在阳光下曝晒。因为她们知道，太阳光中有紫外线和红外线，能晒死细菌。
    人们开始知道近亲结婚是某些遗传病发生和延续的“土壤”。五组青年刘组海从小与表妹青梅竹马，他们理智地熄灭了爱情的火种。
    这里的青年男女也开始学着胎教。２８岁的郭厚蓉告诉我，她怀孕后，丈夫千方百计逗她高兴，常把收录机放在她的肚子旁，放她爱听的音乐，还按书上的方法为她搭配饮食。结果，孩子白净净，胖乎乎，招来了人们的羡慕。“谁家的孩子健壮聪明？”韩场村人攀比的不再是张三、李四生多生少了。
    人口政策和法规的传播，少生优生的现实，教育了韩场村的人们，使他们自觉地执行计划生育这一基本国策。在村育龄妇女室，我见到了一张张写有姓名的月经卡，妇女主任说：“到时，已婚的育龄妇女都会主动地向妇女干部填报显示孕情的月经卡。全村３０２名已婚育龄妇女，全部实行和采取了各种节育措施。”
    村长许支华说：“计划生育是农村工作一大难题。不过，在我们这儿，通过科普教育，干群关系得到了新的调整，行政的和经济的手段似乎用不着了。”
