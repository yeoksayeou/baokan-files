Japanese Prime Minister Takeshita Noboru today delivered a policy speech in the Diet, emphasizing that political reform is the top priority for the Takeshita Cabinet. He also proposed efforts to improve Japan-North Korea relations.

Takeshita said that issues such as the Recruit scandal have increased public distrust in politics, which is a worrying development for Japan's parliamentary democracy. Political reform is the most urgent political task for the Takeshita Cabinet, aimed at restoring public trust in politics.

In the section on foreign policy, Takeshita stated that Japan will continue to adhere to the Peace Constitution and will not become a military power that threatens other countries. This policy remains unchanged. The Japan-U.S. relationship will continue to be the cornerstone of Japan's diplomacy, and strengthening ties with Western European countries is also important. Maintaining and developing stable and good relations with China is a crucial pillar of Japan's diplomacy. Japan will continue to monitor developments on the Korean Peninsula and strive to improve Japan-North Korea relations. Japan also hopes that General Secretary Gorbachev's "new thinking" will lead to policy changes that reflect positively on Japan-Soviet relations, expanding the Japan-Soviet dialogue.

　　竹下登首相谈施政方针    
    强调政治改革是首要课题     
    提出要努力改善日朝关系
    本报东京２月１０日电  记者于青报道：日本首相竹下登今天在国会发表施政方针演说中强调，政治改革是竹下内阁的首要课题。第一次提出努力改善日朝关系。
    竹下说，现在以利库路特问题等为契机，增加了国民对政治的不信任感，这对于日本议会制的民主主义来说，是很令人忧虑的事情。政治改革是竹下内阁最优先的政治课题，以恢复对政治的信赖。
    在外交政策部分，竹下提出，今后也要遵循和平宪法，不做威胁他国的军事大国，这一方针坚持不变。日美关系仍是日本外交的基轴，加强与西欧各国的关系也是重要的。维持、发展日中间良好稳定的关系，是日本外交的重要支柱。要继续注视朝鲜半岛的动态，努力改善日朝关系。期待戈尔巴乔夫总书记的“新思维”改变政策而反映在对日关系方面，扩大日苏对话。
