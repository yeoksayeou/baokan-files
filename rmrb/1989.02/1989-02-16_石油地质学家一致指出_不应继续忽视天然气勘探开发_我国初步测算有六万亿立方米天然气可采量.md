Geologists unanimously point out that natural gas exploration and development should not be neglected. Preliminary calculations show China has 600 billion cubic meters of exploitable natural gas.

	BEIJING -- Compared to the amount of oil extracted, China's natural gas extraction is almost negligible. Is it because China's natural gas reserves are insufficient? Recently, at a symposium held by the editorial department of "Science and Technology Herald," geologists unanimously pointed out: China has considerable natural gas resources underground. However, due to a long-term lack of recognition of the importance of this energy source and insufficient preliminary exploration work, this valuable resource has not been reasonably developed.

	According to experts from the former Ministry of Petroleum, Ministry of Geology, and other departments, using different methods and means, China's underground natural gas reserves are estimated to be between 1500 billion cubic meters and 3300 billion cubic meters, with exploitable reserves exceeding 600 billion cubic meters. A large amount of experimental data from both domestic and international sources, as well as comprehensive oil and gas geological research in China, indicate that China has a good geological foundation for developing the natural gas industry and has several potential large gas fields that have not yet been discovered. Experts believe that the key issue is that China has invested very little in gas field exploration over the years, with the amount of exploration and development work for natural gas being only 1/10 of that for oil. In many oil-producing countries around the world, the investment in natural gas exploration and development accounts for about 1/3 of the total oil and gas development investment, and the energy from the extracted natural gas is approximately equal to the amount of oil extracted.

	Experts say that natural gas is one of the three pillars of the world's energy today, a clean energy source, and a good chemical raw material. Accelerating the development and utilization of natural gas is beneficial for alleviating China's energy supply shortage. Increasing investment and work in natural gas exploration is a necessary prerequisite for changing the slow development of China's natural gas industry.

	Experts also pointed out that currently, the number of people engaged in natural gas exploration and development in China is too small, only 1/10 of those engaged in oil exploration and development. It is necessary to strengthen the natural gas exploration and development team through training of in-service personnel (including technical personnel, cadres, and workers) and by establishing natural gas geology majors in relevant colleges and universities. Additionally, they suggest gathering a group of talents from the petroleum sector, geological sector, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and relevant universities who are enthusiastic about the natural gas industry to establish national and several regional natural gas research centers. These centers would be responsible for the geological research of natural gas in the country and some regions with abundant natural gas resources, and provide exploration decision-making support to the state and relevant regions.

	According to the resource evaluation results from relevant departments, China has at least 7 basins with natural gas resources exceeding 100 billion cubic meters, namely the Tarim, Junggar, Sichuan, Ordos, North China, Songliao, Qiongdongnan-Yangshapu, and East China Sea basins. Experts believe these basins are the main areas for finding large and medium-sized gas fields in China and are the target areas for natural gas exploration and research.

　　石油地质学家一致指出    
    不应继续忽视天然气勘探开发   
    我国初步测算有六万亿立方米天然气可采量
    本报讯  与石油的开采量相比，我国天然气的开采量简直微不足道。是否因为我国的天然气资源贮量不足？日前在《科技导报》编辑部召开的座谈会上，石油地质学家们一致指出：我国地下有相当丰富的天然气资源，但是由于长期以来对这一能源的重要性认识不足，缺乏必要的前期勘探工作，使这种宝贵的资源不能得到合理开发。
    据原石油部、地矿部和其它部门的专家采用不同的方法、手段测算，我国地下天然气的总贮量为１５万亿立方米至３３万亿立方米，可开采量在６万亿立方米以上。国内外大量的实验数据和国内综合油、气地质研究都表明，我国有发展天然气工业良好的地质基础，有一批潜在的大气田，但迄今没有找到。专家们认为：其关键是长期以来我国在勘探气田方面的投资甚少、其勘探开发工作量仅为石油勘探开发工作量的１／１０。而世界上许多石油国家用于天然气勘探开发的投资约为整个油、气开发投资数的１／３，开采出来的天然气能量也都大约等于石油的开采量。
    专家们说，天然气是当今世界能源的三大支柱之一，是洁净能源和良好的化工原料，加速天然气的开发利用有利于缓解我国能源供应不足的局面。而增加天然气勘探的投资和工作量，是改变我国天然气工业发展缓慢状况的必要前提。
    专家们还指出，当前我国从事天然气勘探开发的人员太少，仅为从事石油勘探开发人员的１／１０。要通过对在职人员（包括技术人员、干部和工人）的培训和在有关大专院校开设天然气地质专业等途径，壮大天然气勘探开发队伍。此外，他们建议集中一批包括石油部门、地质部门、中国科学院和有关院校热心从事天然气工业的人才，建立全国和若干个区域性的天然气研究中心，统筹全国和一些天然气资源量丰富区域的地质研究，负责向国家及有关区域提供天然气勘探决策。
    据有关部门资源评价成果表明，我国天然气资源量在１万亿立方米以上的盆地至少有７个，即塔里木、准噶尔、四川、鄂尔多斯、华北、松辽、琼东南—莺歌海和东海盆地。专家们认为这些盆地是我国寻找大中型气田的主要场所，也是勘探和研究天然气的靶区。
