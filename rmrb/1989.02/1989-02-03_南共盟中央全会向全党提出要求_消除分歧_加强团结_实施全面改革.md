The Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia calls for unity and reform

The 20th Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, held from January 30 to February 1 in Belgrade, called on the entire party to eliminate differences, strengthen unity, and strive wholeheartedly for political, economic, and party reforms.

The session was convened amidst worsening political and economic conditions in Yugoslavia and intensifying conflicts within the leadership.

During the meeting, Central Committee members engaged in heated discussions on how to view the severely deteriorating domestic political and economic situations, the tense intra-party relations, and the causes of these conditions. They also discussed the responsibilities of the Central Committee and the Presidium in this regard.

Most speakers noted that since the 17th Plenary Session of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia in October last year, the domestic political and economic situations have further deteriorated. Relations within the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, among the republics and autonomous provinces, and among the ethnic groups have become extremely tense. Serious disagreements and conflicts have arisen among the leaders of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, the republics, and autonomous provinces on a series of major domestic issues. There is a lack of unity among the leaders, and the highest leadership body of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia is in a state of paralysis, making it impossible to implement economic, political, and party reforms.

Many representatives in their speeches pointed out that the Central Committee and its Presidium bear the primary responsibility for this dire situation. They sharply criticized the Presidium and unanimously demanded that the leaders of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia abandon personal interests, eliminate differences and conflicts, unite, and strive wholeheartedly for reforms.

The plenary session removed the former leaders of the Kosovo League of Communists, Vllasi and Dorcic, and the former Chairman of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Mesic, who was involved in the "Agrokomerc" financial scandal, from their positions as members of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia.

In accordance with the principle of separating party and government, the plenary session accepted the resignations of former Federal Prime Minister Mikulic and the members of the Federal Presidency Mojsov, Dolanc, and Hasani, as well as 12 other comrades who held state administrative positions, from their positions as members of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. The plenary session also accepted the resignations of the leaders of the Montenegrin League of Communists, Zarkovic and Orlandic, from their positions as members of the Central Committee and the Presidium of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia.

　　南共盟中央全会向全党提出要求
    消除分歧　加强团结　实施全面改革
    新华社贝尔格莱德２月１日电  １月３０日至２月１日在贝尔格莱德召开的南共联盟２０中全会要求全党消除分歧、加强团结、全力以赴地为实施政治改革、经济改革和党的改革而奋斗。
    这次全会是在南斯拉夫政治经济形势恶化和领导层矛盾激化的情况下召开的。
    会议期间，中央委员们就如何看待国内十分恶化的政治局势和经济局势、十分紧张的党内关系和造成这种局势的原因，以及中央委员会和中央主席团对此应负的责任展开了热烈的讨论。
    大多数发言者在会上指出，自去年１０月南共联盟１７中全会以来，国内政治局势和经济局势进一步恶化，南共联盟内部关系、各共和国和自治省以及各族之间的关系十分紧张。南共联盟中央主席团领导人以及各共和国和自治省共盟领导人之间在国内一系列重大的问题上产生了严重分歧和冲突，领导人之间不团结，共盟最高领导机构处于瘫痪状况，致使经济改革、政治改革和党的改革无法贯彻。
    许多代表在发言中指出，南共联盟中央及其主席团对造成这种恶劣状况负有主要责任。他们纷纷对中央主席团提出了尖锐批评，并一致要求共盟领导人放弃私利，消除分歧和冲突，团结一致，全力以赴地实施改革。
    全会解除了前科索沃共盟领导人弗拉西、多拉舍维奇和同“阿格罗戈梅尔茨”金融舞弊案有牵连的前波黑共盟中央主席团主席梅西诺维奇的南共联盟中央委员职务。
    根据党政分离原则，全会接受了前联邦政府总理米库利奇和南联邦主席团委员莫伊索夫、多兰茨和哈萨尼等１５位兼任国家行政职务的同志辞去南共联盟中央委员职务。全会还接受了黑山共盟领导人扎尔科维奇和奥尔兰迪奇提出辞去南共联盟中央委员和南共联盟中央主席团委员职务的请求。
