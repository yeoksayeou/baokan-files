Rolling polluted water turns into a pool of clear water
    Anshan Iron and Steel Company's largest source of polluted water is effectively treated

    According to Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, February 14: The biological phenol removal project in the south area of Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Chemical Plant has been in operation for four years, and all its wastewater discharge indicators have reached the national standards, thus achieving the goal that Anshan Iron and Steel workers have long pursued of "turning rolling polluted water into a pool of clear water."

    This is the largest phenol and cyanide wastewater treatment project in the national metallurgical system. It recently received the National Quality Engineering Award from the National Quality Engineering Award Review Committee.

    Biological phenol removal utilizes the metabolic functions of microorganisms to artificially create an environment suitable for the life and reproduction of microorganisms, using microorganisms to convert organic pollutants in wastewater into simple inorganic substances. Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Chemical Plant is the largest coking plant in the country, producing over 450 million tons of coke annually, and discharging more than 10,000 tons of wastewater containing harmful substances such as phenol and cyanide daily. The concentration of harmful substances such as phenol and cyanide in the wastewater exceeds the national standards by 40 times and 20 times, respectively. In the past, these untreated wastewater were directly discharged into the Yunliang River, causing serious damage to agriculture and fisheries.

　　滚滚污水变成一池清水   
    鞍钢最大污水源得到根治
    据新华社沈阳２月１４日电  鞍钢化工总厂南区生物脱酚工程，投产运行４年后各项污水排放指标均达到规定的国家标准，从而实现了鞍钢人苦苦追求的“变滚滚污水为一池清水”的目标。
    这项全国冶金系统最大的酚氰污水处理工程近日获得了国家质量奖审定委员会颁发的国家优质工程奖。
    生物脱酚，就是利用微生物所具有的新陈代谢功能，人为地创造适合微生物生活生殖的环境，利用微生物使污水中的有机污染物转变为简单无机物质。鞍钢化工总厂是全国最大的焦化厂，年产焦炭４５０多万吨，每天排放１万多吨含酚、氰等有害物质的污水。含酚、氰有害物质的污水，分别超过国家标准４０倍和２０倍。过去这些污水未经处理直接排入运粮河，给农业渔业造成严重影响。
