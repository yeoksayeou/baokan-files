Recently, Zhao Deyin, Xu Tongkao, Li Dongming, Wu Baozhi, and Xue Qingshen, five farmer entrepreneurs from Pingxiang County, Hebei Province, formed a delegation to visit the missile troops of the Beijing Military Region Air Force. They traveled 1,500 kilometers, crossing mountains and rivers, to visit and comfort 116 soldiers from Pingxiang. They also signed resettlement agreements with each soldier.

During the visit, the five entrepreneurs ate and lived with the soldiers, held discussions with them, and asked about their concerns during their service and their worries about resettlement after discharge. They also met with military leaders to learn about the soldiers' progress. They reached an agreement with the military on employment and resettlement. Soldiers who have been awarded third-class merits or above, received commendations, or been rated as excellent conscripts twice (the military regulation is to rate 30% each year) during their service, and have learned one or two professional skills, will be recommended by their battalion or higher unit upon discharge. Their qualifications will be included in their files, and the farmer entrepreneurs from Pingxiang County will arrange suitable jobs for them in their own enterprises. Ding Tianzhu, one of the soldiers who received third-class merits, happily said, "The people of our hometown care so much about us. They have even thought about our jobs after discharge."

　　平乡农民企业家和战士签订安置协议
    本报讯  最近，河北省平乡县赵德印、徐同考、李东明、武保芝、薛庆生等５名农民企业家组成慰问团，驱车１５００公里，翻山越岭，走访了北京军区空军导弹兵某团，对平乡籍１１６名战士进行慰问，并同每个战士都签订了退伍安置协议书。
    在慰问中，５名企业家和战士们同吃同住，同战士座谈，请他们谈当兵期间最关心和退伍时最担心的问题是什么，还请部队领导介绍战士的进步情况。他们和部队达成一项就业安置协议，凡是在服役期间荣立三等功以上的、受过嘉奖、被评为优秀义务兵２次以上（部队规定每年评３０％）的战士，学得一、二门专业技术，退伍时由部队营以上单位根据条件推荐，装入战士档案，由该县农民企业家在自己企业中妥善安置。三等功荣立者丁天柱高兴地说，家乡人民这样关心爱护我们，连退伍后的工作都为我们想到了。（孙立全　程寿鹏　张红炜）
