Non-legal exit to purchase drugs and transport to Hong Kong
Three drug traffickers executed in Yunnan

Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, February 25 (Reporter Luo Ping) The Intermediate People's Court of Baoshan Region, Yunnan Province, today publicly announced the order from the Supreme People's Court of the People's Republic of China to execute the major drug smugglers Cao Guojin, Yang Chunsheng, and Wu Yingang. These three criminals were immediately executed. Co-defendants Liang Hong'en and Wang Wei were sentenced to 15 years in prison each.

This case was cracked by the public security organs of Longling County, Baoshan Region, Yunnan Province, after thorough investigation. Cao Guojin is a resident of Hong Kong. Last February, he came to Yunnan and colluded with Wu Yingang from Kunming City and Yang Chunsheng from Ruili County to illegally exit the country, purchasing 700 grams of heroin, and then transporting it via Kunming and Guangzhou to Hong Kong. Last June, Cao, along with Liang Hong'en from Hong Kong and Wang Wei from Guangzhou, came to Yunnan again and conspired with Yang Chunsheng and Wu Yingang to traffic drugs. On July 4, the Longling County Public Security Bureau caught Yang Chunsheng in the act of transporting drugs, seizing 4,900 grams of heroin. Subsequently, Cao Guojin, Liang Hong'en, Wang Wei, and Wu Yingang were also apprehended.

The Procuratorate of Baoshan, Yunnan Province, prosecuted the five drug traffickers according to law. The Intermediate People's Court of Baoshan Region tried the case on October 31 last year, sentencing Cao Guojin, Yang Chunsheng, and Wu Yingang to death, stripping them of political rights for life; and sentencing Liang Hong'en and Wang Wei to 15 years in prison each. The five defendants appealed the verdict.

The Higher People's Court of Yunnan Province ruled to dismiss the appeals and reported to the Supreme People's Court for approval. On January 26 this year, after review, the Supreme People's Court ruled to approve the death sentences for Cao Guojin, Yang Chunsheng, and Wu Yingang.

　　非法出境买进毒品运送香港
    三名贩毒犯云南伏法
    新华社昆明２月２５日电  （记者罗苹）云南省保山地区中级人民法院今天公开宣布中华人民共和国最高人民法院下达的对重大走私毒品犯曹国钧、杨春生、吴应刚执行死刑的命令，这３名罪犯随即被处决。同案犯梁洪恩、王伟通被分别判处有期徒刑１５年。
    这个案件是云南省保山地区龙陵县公安机关经过严密侦查破获的。曹国钧是香港居民，去年２月他来云南，勾结昆明市的吴应刚和瑞丽县的杨春生非法出境，买进海洛因７００克，假道昆明、广州运往香港。去年６月，曹犯又与香港的梁洪恩、广州的王伟通一起到云南，再次与杨春生、吴应刚合伙贩运毒品。７月４日，龙陵县公安局将正在运毒品的杨春生抓获，当场缴获海洛因４９００克。随后，曹国钧、梁洪恩、王伟通、吴应刚也相继被缉拿归案。
    云南省人民检察院保山分院依法对５名贩毒分子提起公诉，保山地区中级人民法院去年１０月３１日开庭审理，一审判处曹国钧、杨春生、吴应刚三犯死刑，剥夺政治权利终身；判处梁洪恩、王伟通有期徒刑各１５年。５名案犯不服判决，提出上诉。
    云南省高级人民法院经裁定，驳回上诉。同时报请最高人民法院核准。今年１月２６日，最高人民法院复核后，裁定核准判处曹国钧、杨春生、吴应刚３犯死刑。
