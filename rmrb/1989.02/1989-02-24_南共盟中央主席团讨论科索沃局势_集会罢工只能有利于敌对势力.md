The Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia held an emergency meeting today to discuss the political situation arising from the strikes and protest rallies by Albanian workers in Kosovo.

In a statement issued today, the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia pointed out that such rallies and strikes can only benefit hostile forces, particularly Albanian nationalist separatists and other nationalists. If these actions continue, they will only bring more serious political consequences to the situation in Kosovo, Serbia, and the entire country, as well as to inter-ethnic relations.

The Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia called on members of the League of Communists of Kosovo, League organizations, and institutions to take action and measures to stabilize the situation in Kosovo and stop any actions that disrupt production.

The Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia emphasized in the statement that the only way to stabilize the political situation in Kosovo, primarily to stabilize inter-ethnic relations, restore trust among ethnic groups, and ensure the equality and freedom of all ethnic groups in Kosovo, is to resolutely, thoroughly, and unshakably implement the decisions made by the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia on the Kosovo issue.

The recent escalation in the situation in Kosovo was triggered by the protest rally and strike by workers at the "Trepča" lead-zinc mine on February 21. The striking workers demanded the removal of the newly elected main party and government leaders in Kosovo, the reinstatement of the dismissed original leaders of Kosovo, the rejection of the Serbian constitutional amendments, the retention of the 1974 constitution, and a change in the assessment of the November 1988 protests by Albanian residents of Pristina. According to reports from Tanjug, today, strikes and rallies have spread to almost all areas of Kosovo, making the situation increasingly tense and complex.

　　南共盟中央主席团讨论科索沃局势
    集会罢工只能有利于敌对势力
    新华社贝尔格莱德２月２２日电  （记者王森）南共联盟中央主席团今天召开紧急会议，讨论因科索沃阿尔巴尼亚族工人举行罢工和抗议集会而出现的政治局势。
    南共联盟中央主席团在今天发表的会议公报中指出，这种集会和罢工只能有利于敌对势力，尤其是有利于阿尔巴尼亚民族分裂主义和其他民族主义。如果继续下去，只能给科索沃、塞尔维亚和全国的局势和民族关系带来更加严重的政治后果。
    南共联盟中央主席团号召科索沃共盟盟员、共盟组织和机构采取行动和措施，稳定科索沃的局势，制止任何破坏生产的行为。
    南共联盟中央主席团在公报中强调指出，坚决彻底和毫不动摇地贯彻南共联盟中央就科索沃问题作出的决议，才是稳定科索沃政治局势，首先是稳定民族关系、恢复民族之间的信任和保证科索沃各民族平等和自由的唯一途径。
    科索沃局势再度紧张是由于２１日“特雷普查”铅锌矿工人举行抗议集会和罢工引起的。罢工工人要求撤换新当选的科索沃主要党政领导人，恢复被解职的原科索沃领导人的职务，要求不通过塞尔维亚宪法修正案和保持１９７４年宪法，改变对去年１１月普里什蒂纳阿族人举行游行示威的评价等。据南通社报道，今天，罢工和集会几乎蔓延到科索沃所有区，局势变得越来越紧张和复杂。
