Chinese fashion models were born in 1980, and it has been 9 years since then. In these 9 years, Chinese models have performed fashion shows in France, the Soviet Union, Japan, and many other countries, gaining great fame. Their unique Eastern charm has left foreign audiences in awe.

However, the lack of knowledge and low cultural attainment have seriously hindered the further improvement of the art of modeling. The achievements that models have made are mostly due to their natural talent, but high-level performance art requires knowledge in music, fine arts, dance, and literature and poetry to achieve.

Generally speaking, most of our models are still "natural performers." They can successfully perform cheongsam and lady's wear using the restrained and elegant instincts of Eastern women. However, when it comes to jackets, hunting suits, casual wear, and sportswear, many models struggle or overact. Excellent models not only can distinguish between formal wear, casual wear, and sportswear, walking out different "catwalks," but also can, according to different styles and colors, use different rhythms to fully showcase the design features. To master the art of showcasing clothing appropriately, relying solely on natural talent is not enough.

Fashion shows mainly consist of five parts: catwalk, hip sway, arm extension, body turn, and coat removal, generally without complex dance moves. Although fashion shows are primarily about walking art, they share many similarities with dance in terms of expressing rhythm. Therefore, models should learn dance, at least be able to dance social dances and disco.

The style and color of clothing are abstract compositions, and their connotation is emotion. Therefore, semiotic aesthetics call it an emotional symbol. Music is also abstract, and the connotation it expresses is also emotion. On one hand, models need to understand clothing to fully showcase the designer's intent. On the other hand, they need to use their posture and grace to express the rhythm of the music. Therefore, models need to understand clothing, understand music, and connect clothing and music through emotion.

Fashion models are commercial products. An important job of fashion models is to take fashion photos for fashion magazines and samples to promote sales. Our models are generally weak in this area. Foreign models can pose dozens of different poses in front of the camera, each with a sculptural feel, allowing the photographer to choose and shoot. A Chinese model team, while visiting abroad, encountered a famous sculptor's exhibition. Many of them showed no interest, laughing and joking, and then went to the supermarket to buy things. They did not understand that a human sculpture combines the sculptor's entire artistic cultivation and can withstand observation and appreciation from various angles.

I think it is very necessary to correctly evaluate fashion models, neither biased nor overly praising. For the existing problems, it is also necessary to point them out in a timely manner to facilitate improvement.

　　文化品格——
    中国时装模特亟待解决的课题
    聂昌硕
    中国的时装模特诞生于１９８０年，至今已有９年历史了。９年中，中国模特在法国、苏联、日本等许多国家进行时装表演，获得了极大的声誉。她们独特的东方神韵，使外国观众赞叹不已。
    然而，知识的贫乏和文化素养偏低已严重妨碍了模特表演艺术进一步提高。模特们取得那些成绩，多凭天赋，而高层次的表演艺术却需要音乐、美术、舞蹈及文学诗歌等多方面的学识才能达到。
    从总体来看，我国的模特多数尚属“本色演员”。她们能够运用含蓄的、典雅的东方女性的本能比较成功地表演旗袍、淑女装等，一旦遇到夹克衫、猎装、休闲装、运动装时，不少模特撒不开，或者过分做作。优秀的模特不但能够区分礼服、便服、运动服三大类服装，走出不同味道的“猫步”来，而且可以根据不同的款式、色彩，用不同的节奏型充分展示设计的特色。要能够掌握好分寸，恰到好处地展示服装，单凭天赋显然是不够的。
    时装表演主要是猫步、摆臀、展臂、转体、脱外衣五个部分组成的，一般不做复杂的舞姿。尽管时装表演主要是走的艺术，但它在表现乐感时与舞蹈有许多相似之处，因此，模特应该学习舞蹈，起码应该会跳交谊舞、迪斯科。
    服装的款式和色彩是一些抽象的构成，它的内涵是情感，因此，符号美学称它为情感符号。音乐也是抽象的，音乐所表达的内涵也是情感。模特表演一方面要通晓服装充分地展示设计意图，同时根据乐曲用身姿韵态来表现其节奏型，因此，模特要理解服装，要懂音乐，而且应将服装与音乐用情感联系起来。
    时装模特是商业产物。时装模特很重要的工作就是拍摄时装照，以便时装刊物、样本上刊用，达到促进销售的目的。我国的模特在这方面普遍较差。外国模特可以在镜头前连续做几十个不同的造型，个个都具有雕塑感，任摄影师选择、拍摄。有一支中国模特队在国外访问时遇到一个名家的雕塑展，许多人对此没兴趣，嘻嘻哈哈，一转身都上超级市场去买东西了。她们不懂，一件人体雕塑造型融铸了雕塑家全部艺术修养，是经得起从各个角度的观察和欣赏的。
    我想，正确评价时装模特，既不持偏见，又不一味吹捧，是很必要的。对于存在的问题，也应该及时指出，以利改进。
