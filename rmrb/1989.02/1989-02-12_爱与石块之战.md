On December 8, 1987, the indomitable people of Palestine on the West Bank of the Jordan River and the Gaza Strip, driven by their deep love for their homeland and hatred for the enemy, rose up in rebellion. They used stones as their weapons to engage in a courageous struggle against the Israeli occupiers. This is a battle for national rights, independence, and liberation.

To reflect this struggle, Palestinian filmmakers plan to produce several films, two of which will be made by Egyptian film studios. The first is a television drama produced by a private film company named "The Battle of Love and Stones," which has already been completed and will soon be released to the public.

This television drama is directed by Fayez Hajjab, with a cast composed of famous actors from Egypt and Palestine. The initiator is the renowned Palestinian actor Mahmoud Seyyid.

The television drama shows that the current uprising is fostering widespread awakening, and the sparks of struggle have deeply penetrated people's hearts. Once the time is right, a larger storm will sweep across the entire occupied territory.

The drama exposes the atrocities of the Israeli occupiers without mercy and contrasts their suppression of the Palestinian people with the actions of Nazi Germany in persecuting and exterminating Jews.

In the drama, there is a female resistance fighter who, despite threats, refuses to become an Israeli citizen and resolutely joins the uprising. In the struggle, she develops a deep affection for another resistance fighter. Because the homeland has not yet been liberated and countless compatriots have not yet returned home, she does not establish any intimate relationship with the person she loves, but keeps her deep love hidden in her heart.

There is also a character in the drama who, after the Arab defeat in the 1967 war, once fell into despair and became disheartened. However, the current tenacious struggle of the Palestinian people against the Israeli occupiers has re-energized him, and he has rejoined the fight.

Director Hajjab said that this film deeply illustrates that the uprising of the Palestinian people is a struggle for independence and survival, which will not fade with the passage of time. Instead, it will grow stronger and stronger until the final victory.

　　“爱与石块之战”
    周本
    一九八七年十二月八日，约旦河西岸和加沙地带不屈的巴勒斯坦人民，怀着对祖国深厚的爱和对敌人的恨，纷纷揭竿而起，用石块当武器，与以色列占领者开展了英勇的搏斗。这是一场争取民族权利、独立和自由解放的斗争。
    为了反映这场斗争，巴勒斯坦的电影工作者计划编导几部电影，其中的两部由埃及的电影制片厂生产。第一部是电视剧，由一家私人电影公司摄制，名为“爱与石块之战”，已拍摄完毕，将与观众见面。
    这部电视剧，由法耶兹·哈贾卜导演，剧组由埃及与巴勒斯坦的名演员组成。发起人是巴勒斯坦的著名演员马哈茂德·赛义德。
    电视剧告诉人们，目前这场起义在孕育着广泛的觉醒，斗争的火种已深入人心，一旦时机到来，就会形成席卷整个被占领土的更大风暴。
    对以色列占领者的暴行，电视剧在作了无情揭露的基础上，还把他们对巴勒斯坦人的镇压与当年德国纳粹分子排挤、灭绝犹太人的行径进行了鲜明的对比。
    剧中有个女抵抗战士，她不怕威胁，坚决不做以色列居民，毅然投身于起义行列。在斗争中，她与另一名抵抗战士产生了真挚的感情。由于祖国尚未解放，无数同胞仍未回到家园，她并未与她所爱之人建立任何亲密关系，而把深深的恋情暗藏于心底。
    剧中还有一个人物，因为阿拉伯人在一九六七年的战争中失利，他曾一度失望而消沉了。但是巴勒斯坦人民现在与以色列占领者的顽强斗争，又使他振作起来，重新参加了战斗。
    该剧导演哈贾卜说，这部片子深刻地表明，巴勒斯坦人的起义是为了独立和生存而战，并不会因为岁月的流逝而消亡，相反，将越来越强，直到最后胜利。
