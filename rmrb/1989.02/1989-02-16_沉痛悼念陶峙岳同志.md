The news of Comrade Tao Zhiyue's passing is deeply saddening. Not long ago, I traveled to Changsha, Hunan, to attend his memorial service, paying my respects. Tao Zhiyue has left us, but memories of working together with him in Xinjiang are vivid and ever-present, and I deeply miss this old general.

My first meeting with General Tao Zhiyue was in Jiuquan. In the autumn of 1949, the People's Liberation War had achieved decisive victories nationwide, except for Xinjiang, all of Northwest China had been liberated. At that time, the First Field Army's First Corps, under the command of Commander Wang Zhen, liberated Xining with the First and Second Armies. The Second Army, without stopping, crossed the barren Qilian Mountains and rushed into the Hexi Corridor, reaching Jiuquan and Zhangye, deciding to quickly march into Xinjiang. On September 25, 1949, General Tao Zhiyue led his troops to issue a proclamation of rebellion. In early October, Commander Peng Dehuai of the First Field Army invited General Tao Zhiyue to Jiuquan to discuss the entry of the People's Liberation Army into Xinjiang and the reorganization of the rebel troops. On October 4, General Tao Zhiyue traveled from Di Hua (now Urumqi) by car day and night to reach Jiuquan, where he met me at the Second Army headquarters. At that time, Commanders Peng Dehuai and Wang Zhen were both in Jiuquan at the Second Army headquarters, and I accompanied him to meet with Commanders Peng and Wang. From that day on, I have known General Tao Zhiyue for nearly 40 years. For a long period, we worked together in Xinjiang, jointly participating in the defense and construction of Xinjiang, and thus we were almost always together, forming a deep friendship, becoming good colleagues, close friends, and comrades who closely cooperated with the Party.

General Tao Zhiyue made significant contributions to the peaceful liberation of Xinjiang. To achieve the peaceful liberation of Xinjiang, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao dispatched Comrade Deng Ligong as the Central Liaison Officer to Yili to contact the leaders of the Three Districts National Army and then to Di Hua to convey the telegram from Chairman Mao and the Nationalist Party's Northwest Military and Political Headquarters Commander Zhang Zhizhong to General Tao Zhiyue and Mr. Bao Erhan, explaining the Communist Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao's stance and policy on the peaceful liberation of Xinjiang. General Tao Zhiyue, understanding the situation, was deeply influenced by the patriotism of General Zhang Zhizhong, supporting the Communist Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao's call for a peaceful rebellion. Together with Mr. Bao Erhan, Liu Mengchun, Tao Jincheng, Qu Wu, Liu Zexiong, Liang Kebo, and Deputy Commander-in-Chief and Commander of the 42nd Division of the Nationalist Party Army in South Xinjiang, General Zhao Xiguang, they planned the great cause of a peaceful uprising. For those with deep anti-communist sentiments in the Nationalist Party, such as the Commander of the 78th Division, Ye Cheng, the Commander of the 179th Brigade, Luo Nuren, and the Commander of the 1st Cavalry Division, Ma Chengxiang, General Tao Zhiyue patiently and repeatedly explained the right and wrong, persuading them to understand the situation. However, they insisted on their reactionary stance of harming the country and the people, so they were allowed to leave Xinjiang for India, removing the obstacles to the peaceful uprising and ensuring that the conditions for a peaceful uprising were fully met. Thus, they decisively issued the proclamation of rebellion. This welcomed the entry of the People's Liberation Army into Xinjiang, spared Xinjiang from the ravages of war, and was welcomed by the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang, allowing the 100,000 Nationalist Party troops stationed in Xinjiang to take the glorious path of participating in the revolution, the only correct path.

General Tao Zhiyue made significant contributions to supporting the People's Liberation Army's entry into Xinjiang, suppressing the rebellion of some reactionary officers, and consolidating the victory of Xinjiang's peaceful uprising. After General Tao Zhiyue's proclamation of rebellion on September 25, the People's Liberation Army was in Jiuquan and Yumen, and as the People's Liberation Army bravely marched into Xinjiang, some die-hard elements in the rebel troops in Di Hua, Hami, Chansha, Turpan, Yanqi, Luntai, Kuche, Hutubi, Qijiajing, Suilai (Manas), and other places, together with the old bandit Usman in Xinjiang, created chaos, killing, arson, looting, and rape, endangering the people of all ethnic groups, attempting to seek support from foreign invaders, disrupt the peaceful uprising, and preserve reactionary forces. General Tao Zhiyue ordered the rebel troops to guard their original positions, maintain discipline, maintain local order, and severely punish the rebels. At the same time, he ordered all vehicles of the Nationalist Party's Eighth Supply Area to be transferred to the People's Liberation Army to assist in speeding up the march into Xinjiang, allowing the Second Army to quickly reach various places in South Xinjiang and the Sixth Army to quickly reach various places in North Xinjiang, and to join forces with the anti-Chiang troops of the Three Districts to plant the five-star red flag throughout the Tian Shan Mountains, quickly suppressing the rebellion and consolidating the victory of the peaceful uprising.

General Tao Zhiyue made significant contributions to the reorganization and transformation of the rebel troops. After General Tao Zhiyue led his troops to rebel, he firmly carried out the orders of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and was reorganized into the 22nd Army Corps of the People's Liberation Army, with General Tao Zhiyue as the Commander and Comrade Wang Zhen as the Political Commissar. He wholeheartedly supported the leadership of Comrade Wang Zhen. General Tao Zhiyue issued a letter to the reorganized troops, calling on the rebel soldiers to support the Common Program of the People's Political Consultative Conference, accept the reorganization into a unified army of the People's Republic of China, be under the command of the Revolutionary Military Commission of the Central People's Government, implement unified command, unified system, and unified discipline, and establish a political work system based on the principles of unity between officers and soldiers and between the army and the people, educating the commanders and soldiers of the troops with revolutionary spirit and patriotism. He warmly welcomed the Xinjiang Military Region and the First Corps to dispatch a large number of leading cadres such as Rao Zhengxi, Li Qun, Zhang Zhonghan, He Zhenxin, Wang Jilong, Long Bingchu, Yu Chunshan, and Zhang Xiankui to work in the rebel troops, establish Party organizations in the rebel troops, establish Party leadership, establish the system of political commissars and political work, carry out education on the military motto of serving the people wholeheartedly, improve the relationship between officers and soldiers, between superiors and subordinates, between the rebel troops and local areas, and between the rebel troops and the people of all ethnic groups, transforming this rebel troop into a new type of Chinese people's army under the absolute leadership of the Party. General Tao Zhiyue also underwent transformation in the process of reforming the old army, from a commander of the old army to a commander of the People's Liberation Army, and in 1955, he was awarded the rank of Senior General by the Central People's Government and the Central Military Commission.

General Tao Zhiyue made significant contributions to the construction and development of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps. In 1954, the entire People's Liberation Army underwent reorganization. The Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission decided that the First Corps and the majority of the Fifth Army (originally the Three Districts National Army) of the People's Liberation Army, and the entire 22nd Army Corps would collectively transfer to civilian jobs and establish the Xinjiang Military Region Production and Construction Corps, with Comrade Tao Zhiyue as the Commander and me as the Political Commissar. General Tao Zhiyue felt that his role as the Commander of the Xinjiang Military Region Production and Construction Corps included not only the 22nd Army Corps but also the First Corps and the majority of the Fifth Army under his leadership, which was the greatest trust from the Communist Party. He firmly believed in the correct leadership of the Communist Party Central Committee, deeply understood the great significance of the mission and task of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps to settle and defend the borders, loved the cause of the Xinjiang Military Region Production and Construction Corps, and devoted all his energy to this cause, working tirelessly with all the cadres and soldiers of the Corps. He traveled throughout the Tian Shan Mountains, often visiting the production and construction troops, investigating and studying, understanding the situation, and solving problems. He respected science, valued practice, studied diligently, and quickly became familiar with the business of agriculture, animal husbandry, and afforestation, and devoted himself to learning production and management. Not only could he plan comprehensively, but he could also provide specific guidance, transforming from a general who had spent half his life in military campaigns into an expert in agriculture and economics. Under the leadership and care of the Party Central Committee, the State Council, the then Agricultural Reclamation Department led by Comrade Wang Zhen, the Xinjiang Autonomous Region Party Committee and government, and the support of the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang and throughout the country, and through the hard work of all the cadres and soldiers of the Corps, the production and construction cause of the Corps continued to develop. In the western border of the motherland, in the Tian Shan Mountains, the Erqisi River, the Ili River, the Manas River, the Kuitun River, the Urumqi River, the Kedu River, the Aksu River, the Tarim River, and other river basins, they built water conservancy projects, reclaimed land, built farms and ranches, created new oases, forming agricultural and animal husbandry production bases; built factories, forming new industrial cities; built schools, cultivating talents; supported local economic construction, promoting the development of Xinjiang's economic and cultural construction. Now, the total industrial and agricultural output value of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps accounts for 1/4 of Xinjiang's total industrial and agricultural output value, not only becoming an important force in Xinjiang's economic construction but also an important force in maintaining Xinjiang's stability and unity, strengthening national unity, defending the country's borders, and safeguarding national unity. The great achievements of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps are inseparable from Comrade Tao Zhiyue's long-term efforts and contributions to the Corps.

In 1970, due to his advanced age, Comrade Tao Zhiyue applied to retire and return to Changsha, Hunan, to rest, but he had a deep affection for the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps and always cared about the cause of the Corps, often inquiring about the production and construction situation of the Corps. In 1985, it was the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. The Central Committee decided that Comrade Wang Zhen would serve as the head of the Central Delegation, and Comrade Wang Zhen suggested to the Central Committee that Comrade Tao, then 94 years old and able to move only in a wheelchair, be invited to join the Central Delegation as a deputy head to participate in the celebration activities in Xinjiang. He was very happy to travel with Comrade Wang Zhen by plane to return to Xinjiang. When he saw the great changes in Xinjiang after the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee and the new developments and achievements of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, he was extremely delighted.

General Tao Zhiyue, from participating in the Tongmenghui in 1911, to later joining the Nationalist Party, participating in the Northern Expedition, to participating in the Battle of Shanghai, serving as a division commander, corps commander, deputy commander-in-chief, and commander-in-chief of the Nationalist Party Army, to serving as the deputy commander-in-chief of the Northwest Military and Political Headquarters and the commander-in-chief of the Xinjiang Garrison Command, had gone through a long and winding road. It was only after leading his troops to rebel that he truly realized that only the Communist Party could save China, unify China, and build China. He firmly followed the Communist Party, loyally supported the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and the Party's leadership. During the period when Comrade Wang Zhen was in charge of Xinjiang's work, he highly respected the leadership of the Xinjiang Branch of the Communist Party Central Committee and the Xinjiang Military Region Party Committee, and he firmly carried out the decisions and instructions of the Party Committee. During the period when I was in charge of Xinjiang's work, he also highly respected the leadership of the Xinjiang Branch of the Communist Party Central Committee, the Xinjiang Autonomous Region Party Committee, and the Xinjiang Military Region Party Committee, and he firmly carried out the decisions and instructions of the Party Committee. Before joining the Party, he always took Communist Party members as examples and strictly required himself to the standards of Communist Party members, not seeking special treatment, living simply, observing discipline, working and studying hard, transforming himself, and serving the people wholeheartedly. In 1962, when Comrade Wang Zhen sought his opinion on joining the Communist Party of China, he humbly said, "It is my wish, not my request." In 1965, I reported to Comrade Deng Xiaoping, the General Secretary of the Central Committee, that Comrade Tao Zhiyue met the conditions for a Communist Party member, and our Autonomous Region Party Committee was preparing to formally introduce him to join the Communist Party of China. Comrade Deng Xiaoping immediately expressed his complete agreement. Therefore, he filled out the first application to join the Party and reported it to the Central Committee for approval, but due to the Cultural Revolution starting soon, the approval of his joining the Party was suspended. In 1982, at the age of ninety, he applied to join the Party again and was finally approved by the Central Committee to join the Communist Party of China, realizing his long-cherished wish to become a soldier of proletarian communism. He said, "Why do I want to join the Communist Party of China? There is no other reason. It is because the Communist Party of China is a great, glorious, and correct party. I am convinced that only the Communist Party of China can lead the people of all ethnic groups in China to build a socialist modernized strong country, and only the Communist Party of China can unite the people of all ethnic groups in the country to complete the great cause of national reunification. I regard joining the Communist Party of China as my greatest honor, and I am determined to contribute my due efforts in my lifetime to build the motherland and unify the motherland."

Comrade Tao Zhiyue retired and rested in Changsha, especially during his serious illness, the Party Central Committee, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, the Hunan Provincial Party Committee, and the Provincial Government all showed great concern and care for him. Comrade Wang Zhen often inquired about his condition and cared about his treatment. In June 1987, the Xinjiang Autonomous Region Party Committee, Government, Production and Construction Corps, and I learned that he was seriously ill and specially dispatched Comrade Chen Shi and others to Changsha, Hunan, to visit and comfort him, and he was very grateful. During the period when he was transferred to Beijing Hospital 301 for treatment, I visited him every time I went to Beijing for a meeting, and he was very happy. He was bedridden for a long time and had difficulty walking, but he was very polite and always saw me to the door of the ward.

Comrade Tao Zhiyue led his troops to rebel, firmly followed the Communist Party of China, and ultimately became a glorious soldier of proletarian communism, loyally contributing to the motherland and the people of all ethnic groups. The Party, the country, and the people will never forget his merits and spirit, which will forever be remembered by the people. Comrade Tao Zhiyue, rest in peace.

　　沉痛悼念陶峙岳同志
    王恩茂
    陶峙岳同志病逝的消息传来，令人甚为悲痛。前不久我专程去湖南长沙参加陶峙岳同志的追悼会，寄托了我的哀思。陶峙岳同志与我们长辞了，但回忆与陶峙岳同志在新疆工作的往事，历历在目，总是深切怀念这位老将军不已。
    同陶峙岳将军第一次见面在酒泉。１９４９年秋，人民解放战争在全国取得了决定性的胜利，西北解放战场除新疆外已全部解放。当时，中国人民解放军一野一兵团在王震司令员指挥下，第一、第二军解放西宁后，第二军即马不停蹄地越过荒无人烟的祁连雪山直插河西走廊的张掖，进至酒泉，决定迅速进军新疆。１９４９年９月２５日，陶峙岳将军率部通电起义。１０月初，一野司令员彭德怀同志邀请陶峙岳将军到酒泉商谈人民解放军进军新疆与起义部队改编等大事。１０月４日，陶峙岳将军由迪化（现乌鲁木齐）乘汽车日夜奔驰赶到酒泉，在二军军部和我见了面。当时彭德怀司令员、王震司令员都在酒泉二军司令部，我陪同他一同会见了彭、王司令员。从此，我认识了陶峙岳将军至今快４０年了，其中长时期我与他在新疆一起工作，共同参加保卫和建设新疆的事业，因而几乎朝夕相见，建立了深厚情谊，成了良好的同事、挚友和党密切合作的同志。
    陶峙岳将军为新疆的和平解放事业作出了重大贡献。为争取新疆和平解放，党中央、毛主席委派邓力群同志为中央联络员到伊犁与三区民族军领导人联络，并赶赴迪化转达毛主席和国民党西北军政长官公署长官张治中将军致陶峙岳将军、包尔汉先生的电文，阐明共产党中央与毛主席和平解放新疆的主张和政策，陶峙岳将军审时度势，他深受张治中将军的爱国主义精神影响，拥护共产党中央和毛主席和平起义的号召，同包尔汉、刘孟纯、陶晋初、屈武、刘泽荣、梁克博先生与警备副总司令兼驻南疆国民党军队整编四十二师师长赵锡光将军共商和平义举大事，对反共成见很深的国民党整编七十八师师长叶成，所属一七九旅旅长罗怒人，整编骑一师师长马呈祥，耐心反复晓以是非利害，劝导他们识事务，但他们坚持祸国殃民反动立场，只得允许他们离疆出走印度，排除了和平起义的障碍，做到和平起义条件完全成熟，乃毅然决然通电起义。这样，就为欢迎中国人民解放军进新疆，使新疆免受战争的破坏，受到新疆各族人民的欢迎，为驻疆１０万国民党军队得以走上光荣参加革命唯一正确的道路。
    陶峙岳将军为支援人民解放军进疆，平息部分反动军官的叛乱，巩固新疆和平起义的胜利作出了重大贡献。陶峙岳将军“九·二五”通电起义后，人民解放军正在酒泉、玉门等地，在中国人民解放军英勇进军新疆时，起义部队中的一些坚持反共反人民的死心踏地分子，在迪化、哈密、鄯善、吐鲁番、鄢耆、轮台、库车、呼图壁、七角井、绥来（玛纳斯）等地与新疆老土匪乌斯曼等制造叛乱，杀人、放火、抢劫、奸淫，危害各族人民，妄图寻求外国侵略者的支援，破坏和平起义，保存反动势力。陶峙岳将军命令起义部队驻守原防，遵守军纪，维护地方秩序，严惩叛乱分子，同时命令国民党八补给区所有的军用车辆调给人民解放军，协助人民解放军加快进疆行程，使二军加快到达南疆各地，六军加快到达北疆各地，并会合三区反蒋部队把五星红旗插遍天山南北，迅速平息了叛乱，巩固了和平起义的胜利。
    陶峙岳将军为起义部队的整编和改造作出了重大贡献。陶峙岳将军率部起义后坚决奉行毛主席、朱总司令的命令，被整编为中国人民解放军二十二兵团，陶峙岳将军任司令，王震同志兼任政委。他衷心拥护王震同志的领导。陶峙岳将军发表为整编部队告起义将士书，号召起义将士拥护人民政协共同纲领，接受整编为中华人民共和国统一的军队，受中央人民政府革命军事委员会统率，实行统一的指挥，统一的制度，统一的纪律，根据官兵一致，军民一致的原则，建立政治工作制度，以革命精神和爱国精神教育部队的指挥员和战斗员。他热诚欢迎新疆军区和一兵团调派饶正锡、李铨、张仲瀚、贺振新、王季龙、龙炳初、于春山、张献奎等一大批领导干部到起义部队工作，在起义部队中建立党的组织，树立党的领导，建立政治委员和政治工作制度，进行全心全意为人民服务的建军宗旨教育，改善官兵关系，上下级关系，起义部队同地方的关系、同各族人民群众的关系，把这一支起义部队改造成为置于党的绝对领导下的新型的中国人民的军队。陶峙岳将军也在改造旧军队的过程中得到了改造，由旧军队的将领成为中国人民解放军的将领，１９５５年被中央人民政府、中央军委授予上将军衔。
    陶峙岳将军为建设和发展新疆生产建设兵团作出了重大贡献。１９５４年，中国人民解放军全军进行整编，党中央、国务院、中央军委决定中国人民解放军一兵团、五军（原三区民族军）的大部和二十二兵团全部集体转业，成立新疆军区生产建设兵团，陶峙岳同志任司令员，我兼任政治委员。陶峙岳将军感到他任新疆军区生产建设兵团司令员，不仅包括二十二兵团，而且包括一兵团和五军的大部归他领导，这是共产党对他的最大信任，他坚信中国共产党中央的正确领导，深知新疆生产建设兵团屯垦戍边任务和意义的重大，他热爱新疆军区生产建设兵团事业，把全部心血倾注在这一事业上，和兵团全体干部、战士辛勤劳动，艰苦创业。他走遍了天山南北，经常深入生产建设部队，调查研究，了解情况，解决问题。他尊重科学，注重实践，刻苦学习，迅速熟悉了工农业畜牧业和植树造林等生产业务，专心致志学习生产经营管理，不仅能统筹计划，还能具体指导，由一个大半生经历戎马生涯的将军成了一个农业专家，经济专家。在党中央、国务院的领导和关怀下，在当时王震同志领导的农垦部的领导和关怀下，在新疆自治区党委和政府的领导和关怀下，在新疆各族人民和全国各族人民的支援下，经过兵团全体干部战士的艰苦奋斗，兵团的生产建设事业不断发展，在祖国西部边疆、天山南北、额尔齐斯河、伊犁河、玛纳斯河、奎屯河、乌鲁木齐河、开都河、阿克苏河、塔里木等流域，兴修水利，开荒造田，建设农场、牧场，创建新的绿洲，形成农业、牧业生产基地；建设工厂，形成新的工业城市；建设学校，培养人才；支援地方经济建设，促进了新疆经济文化建设的发展。现在，新疆生产建设兵团工农业总产值已占到新疆工农业总产值的１／４，不仅成了新疆的重要经济建设力量，也是新疆安定团结，增强民族团结，保卫祖国边疆、维护祖国统一的重要力量。新疆生产建设兵团取得的巨大成就，和陶峙岳同志长期在兵团努力工作所作的贡献是分不开的。
    １９７０年陶峙岳同志因年事已高，申请离职回湖南长沙休息，但他对新疆生产建设兵团有着一种深厚的感情，还始终关心着兵团的事业，经常询问兵团的生产建设情况。１９８５年，是新疆维吾尔自治区成立三十周年，中央决定王震同志任中央代表团团长，王震同志建议中央邀请陶老参加中央代表团任副团长，去新疆参加庆祝活动，陶老当年已达９４岁高龄，只能坐轮椅行动，但他十分高兴地随同王震同志长途乘坐飞机重回新疆。当他看到新疆在党的十一届三中全会后有了巨大变化，新疆生产建设兵团有了新的发展，取得了新的成绩，感到无比欣喜。
    陶峙岳将军从１９１１年参加同盟会到以后参加国民党，参加北伐，到参加淞沪抗战，任过国民党军队的师长、军长、集团军副总司令、总司令，直到任西北军政长官公署副长官、新疆警备司令部总司令，走过了漫长曲折的道路，而只有率部起义后才真正认识到只有中国共产党才能救中国，才能统一中国，才能建设中国。他坚定地跟着共产党走，忠诚地拥护党中央，拥护毛主席，拥护党的领导。在王震同志主持新疆工作的时期，他很尊重中共中央新疆分局和新疆军区党委的领导，对于党委的决定和指示都是坚决贯彻执行的。在我主持新疆工作的时期，他也很尊重中共中央新疆分局、中共新疆自治区党委和新疆军区党委的领导，对于党委的决定和指示也都是坚决贯彻执行的。他在没有加入党前，总是以共产党员为榜样，以共产党员标准严格要求自己，不要特殊待遇，生活简朴，遵守纪律，努力工作、学习，改造自己，全心全意为人民服务。１９６２年，王震同志征求他加入中国共产党的意见时，他谦恭地说：“是所愿也，非敢请也。”１９６５年，我向中共中央总书记邓小平同志报告请示，说陶峙岳同志具备了共产党员条件，我们自治区党委准备正式介绍他加入中国共产党。邓小平同志当即表示了完全同意。因此曾请他填写了第一份入党申请书并报中央批准，但因不久“文革”开始了，批准他入党的问题被搁置了。１９８２年他年已九十，再次申请入党，终于为中共中央批准，被接收为中共党员，实现了他成为无产阶级共产主义战士的宿愿。他说：“我为什么要加入中国共产党，没有别的，是因为中国共产党是伟大、光荣、正确的党，我确认只有中国共产党才能领导中国各族人民建设社会主义现代化强国，只有中国共产党才能团结全国各族人民完成祖国统一大业。我以加入中国共产党为最大的光荣，我决心在有生之年为建设祖国，为统一祖国而贡献应有的力量。”
    陶峙岳同志在长沙离职休养，特别是在他病重期间，党中央、国务院、中央军委、湖南省委、省人民政府都对他很关心和照顾。王震同志经常询问他的病情，关心他的治疗。１９８７年６月，新疆自治区党委、人民政府、生产建设兵团和我知道他病重特派陈实同志等专程到湖南长沙看望和慰问他，他很感谢。党中央、国务院、中央军委、湖南省委、省政府将他转至北京三○一医院治病期间，我每次到北京开会，都到医院看望他，他很高兴，他久卧病榻，步履艰难，但很重礼貌，每次都要送我到病房门口。
    陶峙岳同志率部起义，坚定跟着中国共产党走，最终成为光荣的无产阶级共产主义战士，忠诚地为祖国为各族人民作出了光辉的贡献，党、国家和人民永远不会忘记，他的功绩和精神永留人间。陶峙岳同志，安息吧。
