The Chinese NPC delegation, led by Vice Chairman Ye Fei, concluded its eight-day official friendly visit to the Philippines today and departed for home.

At the airport, Ye Fei told reporters that the visit was very successful. He had sincere and friendly conversations with Filipino congressmen and exchanged views on issues of mutual concern. President Corazon Aquino warmly received the delegation.

Ye Fei said that all of this shows that there is a bond of brotherhood and kinship between the peoples of China and the Philippines. He said that the relationship between China and the Philippines is "deep-rooted and flourishing."

Ye Fei happily mentioned that during this visit, he revisited his birthplace, Tiaong Town, which he had not seen for 70 years, and reunited with his three generations of relatives. He said, "The excitement of revisiting my birthplace is indescribable."

In response to a reporter's question, Ye Fei said that he appreciated the Aquino government and the Congress for adhering to the one-China principle. He emphasized that Taiwan has been a part of China since ancient times, and the peaceful reunification of the motherland is the common wish of all Chinese people, including those in Taiwan and overseas. The 75-year-old General Ye Fei said that he believed he would see the day of peaceful reunification of the motherland in his lifetime.

During his visit, Ye Fei also had a cordial meeting with prominent figures in the Chinese community.

    叶飞赞赏菲政府和国会的一个中国立场
    新华社马尼拉１月３１日电  由叶飞副委员长率领的中国人大代表团结束对菲律宾为期８天的正式友好访问后，今天离开这里回国。
    在机场接受记者采访时，叶飞说，访问非常成功。他同菲律宾国会议员们进行了诚恳和友好的谈话，并就共同关心的问题交换了看法。科拉松·阿基诺总统亲切地会见了代表团。
    叶飞说，所有这一切都表明中菲两国人民之间存在着兄弟加亲戚的友谊。他说，中菲两国关系是“根连根，根深叶茂”。
    叶飞高兴地谈到，这次他访问了阔别７０年的出生地——蒂亚翁镇，并同他的３代亲人团聚。他说：“我重访出生地的激动心情是难以用言语表达的。”
    在回答记者提问时，叶飞说，他对阿基诺政府和国会坚持只有一个中国的立场表示赞赏。他强调说，台湾自古以来就是中国的一部分，和平统一祖国是包括台湾和海外同胞在内的所有中国人的共同愿望。７５岁的叶飞将军说，他相信在他有生之年内会见到和平统一祖国的这一天的到来。
    叶飞在访问期间，还与华侨界知名人士举行了亲切会见。
