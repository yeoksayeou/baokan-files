Pakistani Ambassador Discusses Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's Visit to China
Pakistan and China Have Broad Consensus on Major International Issues

BEIJING, Feb. 10 (Xinhua) — Pakistani Ambassador Akram Zaki said today that Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's visit to China, starting tomorrow, aims to establish personal friendships and close working relationships with Chinese leaders.

He said Bhutto's visit will ensure that the mutually beneficial friendly relations between Pakistan and China are passed on from generation to generation. "Pakistan-China friendship is crucial for maintaining peace and security in this region."

Prime Minister Bhutto is scheduled to visit China from February 11 to 13 and will meet with Chinese leaders including Deng Xiaoping, Zhao Ziyang, and Li Peng.

In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, Zaki described this visit as "significant." He said Bhutto had expressed her new government's willingness to strengthen and consolidate the time-tested Pakistan-China friendship during her first press conference after taking office. China is the first country she visited after assuming the premiership in December last year.

Zaki pointed out that developing friendship with China remains a major principle and pillar of the new Pakistani government's foreign policy.

He recalled that in the nearly 40 years since the establishment of diplomatic relations, the two countries have built a broad cooperative friendship based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. This friendship is seen as a model for cooperation and friendship between two countries with different systems.

In the political arena, Zaki said, Pakistan and China have broad consensus on major international issues and closely cooperate to maintain regional and international peace and stability. Both countries oppose foreign military intervention in Afghanistan and Cambodia. On issues such as opposing apartheid, supporting the independence of Namibia and Palestine, restoring peace in the Middle East, and establishing a new international economic order, the two countries hold similar or identical views.

He believed that the frequent exchanges between the military forces of the two countries are purely defensive and not directed against any third country. He said, "The support China has given Pakistan in maintaining its independence and territorial integrity has left a deep impression on the Pakistani people."

In the economic and trade sectors, the two countries have also conducted "close" cooperation. Bilateral trade has developed steadily, reaching approximately $360 million in 1987, and the trade volume in 1988 may be less than in 1987. However, Zaki revealed that the Pakistani Minister of Commerce will soon visit China to discuss with the Chinese side to reverse this situation.

He pointed out that the two countries have frequent cultural exchanges, with art troupes frequently visiting each other, which has also promoted the development of bilateral relations.

　　巴驻华大使谈贝·布托总理访华    
    巴中对重大国际问题有着广泛一致见解
    新华社北京２月１０日电  （记者杨国强）巴基斯坦驻华大使阿克拉姆·扎基今天在这里说，巴基斯坦新总理贝·布托明天开始的中国之行旨在同中国领导人建立私人友情和密切的工作关系。
    他说，贝·布托的来访将使巴中之间互利合作的友好关系代代相传，“巴中友谊对维护本地区的和平与安全至关重要。”
    贝·布托总理定于２月１１日—１３日访华，并将会见邓小平、赵紫阳、李鹏等中国领导人。
    在接受新华社记者单独采访时，扎基称这次访华“意义重大”。他说，贝·布托在她就任后举行的第一次记者招待会上就表示了新政府愿意加强和巩固久经考验的巴中友谊的决心。中国是她去年１２月出任总理后进行国事访问的第一个国家。
    扎基指出，贝·布托总理的来访表明了发展同中国的友谊仍是巴基斯坦新政府外交政策的一个主要原则和支柱。
    他回顾说，巴中建交近４０年来，两国在和平共处五项原则基础上建立起了内容广泛的合作友好关系，这种友好关系被认为是两个不同制度的国家发展合作与友谊的典范。
    在政治领域，扎基说，巴中两国对重大国际问题有着广泛一致的见解，并密切配合以维护地区及国际和平与稳定。两国都反对外国军队武装干涉阿富汗和柬埔寨。在反对种族隔离，支持纳米比亚和巴勒斯坦独立，恢复中东和平和建立国际经济新秩序方面，两国也持相同或相似的观点。
    他认为，巴中两国军队的频繁交流纯粹是防御性的，并非针对任何第三国。他说，中国对巴基斯坦在维护独立和领土完整方面所给予的支持，给巴基斯坦人民留下了深刻印象。
    在经济、贸易方面，两国也进行了“密切”合作。双边贸易稳步发展，１９８７年达到约３．６亿美元，１９８８年的贸易额可能小于１９８７年。但扎基透露说，巴商业部长将于不久访华，同中国方面进行商谈以扭转这种局面。
    他指出，两国在文化方面交流频繁，文艺团体经常互访，这也推动了两国关系的发展。
