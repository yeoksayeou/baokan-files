    District Head of Chaoyang, Beijing, Visits Site to Address Issues
    Garbage Station, Completed Months Ago, Now in Use

    Our reporter Mo Xinyuan reports: After our newspaper published the letter and on-site photographs titled "Garbage Station Completed but Garbage Still Piles Up on Streets" on February 4, it drew the attention of the Chaoyang District People's Government in Beijing.

    The next day, District Head Song Weiliang personally visited the site to investigate why the sealed garbage station, completed three months ago, had not been put into use. He demanded that the issue of missing parts be resolved as soon as possible, ensuring that the garbage station would be operational by February 13. He also instructed the street offices to strengthen the management of garbage collection points. Song Weiliang hoped that relevant units and residents would voluntarily comply with the regulations and cooperate with sanitation workers to jointly improve the environmental hygiene. Through the efforts of the sanitation department, the garbage station began operation on February 13.

    落成数月的垃圾站已投入使用
    本报讯  记者莫新元报道：本报２月４日登出《修了垃圾站仍然垃圾满街》的读者来信及现场照片后，引起了北京市朝阳区人民政府的重视。
    第二天，区长宋维良专程到现场调查那座落成３个月的密闭式垃圾站迟迟不用的原因，要求尽快解决垃圾站部分零件不配套的问题，务必使垃圾楼在２月１３日之前投入使用，并要求街道办事处加强垃圾站点的管理。宋维良还希望有关单位和居民自觉遵守有关规定，配合环卫人员共同治理好环境卫生。经过环卫部门的紧张工作，这座垃圾站已于１３日开始启用。
