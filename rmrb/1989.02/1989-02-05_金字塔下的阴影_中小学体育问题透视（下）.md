The competition in the 21st century will be a comprehensive competition of human quality. The foundation of the physical quality of the entire nation requires us to shift from the gold medal strategy to the broad masses of young people, to the crowded playgrounds and backward classrooms. The weak conditions for physical education in primary and secondary schools will leave an indelible shadow on the vision of a sports power.

Crowded venues continue to be encroached upon

Ms. Tang Shufen from Beijing's Chongwen District said that her school, with 900 students, has only a small triangular field. Physical education classes are conducted in batches, and the 100-meter dash has to be done on the road. By the end of 1987, the per capita sports field area for primary school students in Beijing was 1.15 square meters, and for middle school students, it was only 5.62 square meters. A space the size of a basketball court has to accommodate 75 middle school students or 365 primary school students at the same time. Nationwide, an average of 6.5 middle schools or 96 primary schools share one sports field! We cannot ignore the reality.

The impact of the population peak has led to a significant increase in the number of students in primary and secondary schools, but the sports venues have shrunk again and again, with various forms of encroachment still occurring, and this has become more serious in recent years.

To solve the problem of insufficient school buildings and the "two-shift system" for students, schools that are already crowded have to extend their hands to their own sports venues. The playground of Beijing No. 59 Middle School has been covered with a building, and in the 1950s, it was possible to play football there. The principals of primary and secondary schools also have their difficulties: now everything requires conditions, without welfare and housing, teachers have no motivation; higher authorities assign the task of solving the two-shift system, but do not provide the space, so they have to occupy the playground. But is the sports field not a classroom for students?

Without venues, physical education classes have to be held on the roads and alleys. In Beijing's Xicheng District, 23 primary schools and 13 middle schools have been conducting classes on the roads for years. Crowded roads and alleys can never replace sports fields.

"Poor in Literature, Poor in Martial Arts" and Inverted Sports Views

Compared to the 1950s, school sports equipment has improved to some extent, but relative to the number of students and modern sports standards, it has become worse and worse.

The common problem is the single and outdated equipment. Few schools can equip the necessary equipment according to the teaching outline. Mr. Liu Tianchang, who is 50 years old, said: "The horizontal bar, parallel bars, and mats are all older than me. In the past few years, prices have soared, and even if you want to replace them, you can't."

After a decade of reform, we have some money, and perhaps we can buy food, clothing, pianos, and violins for the children without hesitation, but it is difficult to spend money on sports equipment for the children. This is a dangerous mindset.

The saying goes, "Poor in literature, rich in martial arts," but we are poor in both. Emphasizing that sports funds should account for 1% of the total educational investment, even if it is implemented, there will only be 2.5 billion yuan (in 1988), while there are 220 million primary and secondary school students nationwide. Isn't this a drop in the bucket?

The inversion of concepts and the irrationality of the system have led to the formation of an inverted pyramid in the allocation of funds: competitive sports occupy the absolute majority, while mass sports, especially in primary and secondary schools, are meager. Ms. Jia Yuru from Beijing's Dongbaojiao Primary School said: "The playground needs to be renovated with water, and using one ton of water costs 50 yuan. The monthly per capita funds for students are 2.4 cents, what can be done with that?"

Our country is not yet rich, and perhaps we cannot afford to invest more in education, but we cannot be complacent and shirk our responsibilities. Physical education in primary and secondary schools is a major issue for the entire nation and requires attention and support from the whole society. In the 1950s, we were not rich, but school sports were quite lively, which is a question worth considering.

Where is the Way Forward?

We need a complete legal guarantee for the normal conduct of physical education teaching in schools. Sports venues and equipment are not luxury items that can be dispensed with.

We have devoted too much energy and funds to gold medals, like giants injected with hormones, obsessed with the ecstasy of victory and the deep self-abasement of failure.

Various levels of cities have built a large number of sports venues and training bases, but few of them can be fully utilized or opened to primary and secondary school students. We have built more and more parks, high-rise buildings, and roads, but few public sports venues. More and more social idle funds flow into leisure activities such as billiards and tourism, while the social investment in school sports is relatively less and does not play its due role.

Human living space is gradually shrinking.

The masters of the 21st century need not only intelligent brains and profound knowledge but also healthy bodies. We have no right to deprive the next generation of the world and opportunities.

Where is the way forward? The path is under our feet.

The improvement of a nation's quality can only be achieved through cultivation, not through stimulation. Facing the current state of physical education in primary and secondary schools, what can we do for the masters of the 21st century?

　　金字塔下的阴影
　　——中小学体育问题透视（下）
    ２１世纪的竞争将是人的素质的全面竞争。全民族身体素质这个立足点，要求我们从金牌战略转向广大青少年，转向拥挤的操场、落后的课堂。薄弱的中小学体育教学条件，将给体育强国的构想留下难以抹去的阴影。
　　拥挤的场地仍被不断侵占
    北京市崇文区的唐淑芬老师说，她所在的小学９００人只有一块小三角场地，课间操分批做，百米跑只能上马路。到１９８７年底，北京市小学生人均场地１．１５平方米，中学生也只５．６２平方米。篮球场大小的地方要同时容纳７５个中学生或３６５个小学生。全国平均６．５所中学或９６所小学才有一个运动场！我们不能不正视现实。
    人口高峰的冲击，使中小学在校人数激增，但体育场地却一缩再缩，各种名目的侵占仍有发生，近年来更为严重。
    为解决校舍不足和学生轮流上课的“二部制”问题，本来就拥挤的学校只好向自己的体育场地伸手。北京５９中操场上盖了楼，５０年代那儿可以踢足球。中小学校长也有难处：现在干什么都讲条件，没有福利和住房，老师没有劲头；上级布置解决二部制，却不给地方，只好占操场。可体育场地算不算学生的课堂呢？
    没有场地，体育课只好到马路和胡同里上，北京市西城区有２３所小学和１３所中学长年在马路上课。拥挤的马路和胡同怎么说也不能代替运动场。
　　“穷文穷武”和颠倒的体育观
    和５０年代比，学校体育器材有了一定改善，但相对于学生人数和现代体育水平来说，却越差越远。
    普遍的问题是器材的单一和老化，很少有学校能按教学大纲要求配备相应器材。５０岁的刘天长老师说：“单杠、双杠、垫子比我的岁数都大。这几年物价猛涨，想换也换不成。”
    改革十年，我们有了一些钱，也许可以毫不犹豫地为孩子买食品、衣物、钢琴、提琴，却很难舍得为孩子买体育用品。这是一种内含危机的心态。
    俗话说穷文富武，我们却是穷文穷武。强调体育经费要占全部教育投资的１％，即便得到落实，也只有２．５亿元（１９８８年），而全国有２．２亿大中小学生，难道不是杯水车薪么？
    观念的本末倒置和体制的不合理，使资金分配形成倒金字塔：竞技体育占绝对大头，而群众体育特别是中小学，却少得可怜。北京东八角小学贾雨儒老师说：“操场要喷水翻修，超用一吨水交５０元，学生月均２分４厘钱的经费，能干什么？”
    我们国家还不富裕，也许拿不出更多的钱投资教育，但不能心安理得地推卸责任。中小学体育是全民族的大事，需要全社会的关注和扶持。５０年代我们并不富裕，但学校体育却蛮红火，这是个值得思考的问题。
　　敢问路在何方
    我们需要完善的立法保障学校体育教学正常进行。体育场地器材等教学条件不是可有可无的奢侈品。
    我们把过多的精力和资金用在金牌上，像打了激素的巨人，热衷于胜利的狂热陶醉和失败的深刻自卑。
    各级城市修建了大批体育场馆和训练基地，但能充分利用或向中小学生开放的却很少。我们修建了越来越多的公园高楼马路，却很少修建社会公用体育场所。越来越多的社会闲散资金流向台球、旅游等消闲活动中，真正用于学校体育的社会投资相对来讲却越来越少，也发挥不了应有的作用。
    人类的生存空间正在逐步缩小。
    ２１世纪的主人们不仅需要聪明的大脑和渊博的知识，更需要健康的体魄。我们没有权利再剥夺未来一代的世界和机会。
    敢问路在何方？路在脚下。
    一个民族素质的提高只能靠培养，而不能靠刺激。面对中小学体育教育的现状，我们能为２１世纪的主人们做些什么呢？　　　　　　　卞文阳　林述安
