The three-day-long second informal Jakarta meeting on the Cambodian issue concluded tonight. The meeting failed to reach any substantive agreement.

Host country Foreign Minister Ali Alatas issued a statement on behalf of the chairman, which included 19 points. The statement listed only three points of "consensus" and numerous points of disagreement.

The statement said that the parties reached consensus on the following three points: the Cambodian issue must be resolved through political means; the establishment of an independent, sovereign, peaceful, neutral, and non-aligned Cambodia; and the pursuit of a comprehensive, fair, lasting, and package solution.

The statement noted that there are still many important issues that need further discussion by the conflicting parties. These issues mainly include:

The day the Cambodian agreement comes into effect, which is the time for the ceasefire within Cambodia to be implemented;

All Vietnamese troops, military advisors, armed personnel, weapons, and other war materials should begin withdrawing immediately after the ceasefire is implemented, and at the latest no later than September 30, 1989. However, whether the withdrawal is based on numbers or regions and whether it is to be phased, remains to be discussed further;

The participants welcomed the continuation of talks among the warring parties on various issues, particularly on the establishment of a four-party national reconciliation interim authority led by Sihanouk. The participants suggested that the four parties "report the results of the talks to the chairman of the informal Jakarta meeting within four months."

The international conference should be convened after the informal Jakarta meeting reaches broad consensus on various issues. The international conference should provide guarantees to implement all agreements reached. The international conference should propose an economic recovery plan for Cambodia and other countries in the region and provide the necessary funds. The statement also mentioned issues that need "further discussion," including the need to take specific measures to prevent the Khmer Rouge from regaining power, the timetable for the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops must be "consistent" with the cessation of aid to the Cambodian conflicting parties, and the need to stop all foreign interference and the provision of military aid to the Cambodian parties.

The participating parties tentatively agreed to hold another Jakarta meeting in the next four months, but there was no guarantee from the parties on this.

　　雅加达会议无实质进展而散
    一大堆问题留待冲突各方进一步讨论
    新华社雅加达２月２１日电  （记者李永明）为期３天的关于柬埔寨问题的第二次雅加达非正式会议今天晚上结束。会议没有达成任何实质性协议。
    东道国外长阿拉塔斯以会议主席名义发表了一份包括１９点的声明。声明只罗列了三点“一致”的方面和大量分歧点。
    声明说，各方在如下３点上达成一致：柬埔寨问题必须通过政治办法解决；建立一个独立、主权、和平、中立和不结盟的柬埔寨；谋求全面、公正、持久和一揽子解决方案。
    声明认为还有许多重要问题有待冲突各方“进一步讨论”。这些问题主要包括：
    柬问题协议生效之日，即柬内部停火实施之时；
    全部越南军队、军事顾问、武装人员、武器和其他战争物资，应当在停火实施后立即开始撤离，最晚不能超过１９８９年９月３０日，但撤军是根据数量还是根据地区进行以及是否分阶段，有待进一步讨论；
    与会者欢迎交战各方就各方面的问题继续举行会谈，特别是就建立以西哈努克为首的四方民族和解临时权威机构问题进行会谈。与会者建议四方“在四个月内向雅加达非正式会议主席通报会谈的结果”。
    国际会议应该在雅加达非正式会议就各种问题取得广泛一致之后召开。国际会议应该提供保证，以便实施所有达成的协议。国际会议应为柬埔寨和本地区其他国家提出一个经济复兴计划以及提供必要的资金。声明提到有待“进一步讨论”的问题还包括必须采取具体措施防止红色高棉重新单独掌权、越南撤军时间表必须与停止对柬冲突各方的援助相“一致”，必须制止一切外国干涉和向柬各方提供军援等。
    与会各方初步同意今后４个月内举行另一次雅加达会议，但各方对此没有作出保证。
