    Soaring Housing Prices Leave Common People Gazing at Buildings in Awe; Government Must Take Control and is Drafting Regulations

    According to a report in today's *Market News*, reporters recently learned from the Urban Housing Department of the Ministry of Construction that, in response to the current issues of high prices and sluggish sales in the housing market across various regions, the Ministry of Construction, the State Price Bureau, and the Construction Bank are jointly drafting six regulations, including the "Interim Measures for the Management of Commercial Housing Prices" and "Several Regulations on the Housing Market." These regulations will clearly define that inflating costs and seeking excessive profits by operators are illegal behaviors. The chaotic and rapidly rising prices of commercial housing are expected to be corrected by law.

    According to the latest statistics, the total amount of national savings deposits plus the cash in people's pockets reaches 55 billion yuan. How to convert these consumption funds into production capital and use a large number of commercial housing units to circulate currency is a necessary measure.

    However, for ordinary cadres, buying a house is likened to picking a star from the night sky. In January of this year, Shanghai's housing market sold over 11,000 units, but fewer than 1/10 were actually sold. Buildings stand empty, with tens of thousands of square meters of new housing vacant. The reason is the exorbitant prices; the highest price per square meter has reached 2,300 yuan, shocking to the public. Recently, Beijing has provided over 20,000 square meters of housing, priced between 1,600 to 1,900 yuan per square meter. Buying a two-bedroom apartment would cost at least 60,000 yuan. A university graduate starting work and saving 50 yuan a month, which is the maximum, would need 100 years to afford a two-bedroom apartment.

    The rapid increase in commercial housing prices can be attributed to several factors. First, real estate development is seen as the most profitable business. Over the past few years, various real estate companies have flooded the market, with over 2,700 companies emerging nationwide. While many real estate companies have contributed to the development of commercial housing, some have engaged in illegal and fraudulent activities, causing significant violations of laws and regulations. Second, the lack of corresponding policies and regulations for price formation has led to a lack of uniformity, with some regulations listing 10 items and others listing more. In addition to the basic construction cost, the costs for supporting facilities such as residential committees, police stations, shops, primary and secondary schools, kindergartens, parks, clinics, and roads amount to two or even three times the basic construction cost. In the future, the cost calculation, pricing, and profits of commercial housing will be subject to legal constraints.

### 房价猛涨　百姓望楼兴叹  势在必控　国家正拟法规

　　房价猛涨　百姓望楼兴叹    
    势在必控　国家正拟法规
    本报讯  据今天的《市场报》报道：记者最近从建设部城市住宅局了解到，针对目前各地住宅市场出现的价高、滞销等问题，建设部、国家物价局、建设银行正在会同制定《商品房价管理暂行办法》、《关于住宅市场的若干规定》等６个法规，将明确规定经营者虚报成本、图谋厚利属非法行为，商品房价混乱猛涨等现象可望依法纠正。
    据最新统计，全国储蓄存款加上私人口袋里的现钞，总数达５５００亿元。如何把这些消费资金变为生产基金，拿出大量的商品住宅组织货币回笼是一个必要办法。
    但是，买房对普通干部来说，有人打比喻，犹如从夜空里摘颗星星。今年１月，上海住宅市场年初出售１１０００多套住房，成交不到１／１０，幢幢楼房无人买，几十万平方米新住宅空空荡荡。原因是价格昂贵，每平方米最高价已达２３００元，令人咋舌。北京最近提供２万多平方米住房，每平方米为１６００元—１９００元。若买两居室，少说也要６万多元。一名大学生从参加工作起就日日节衣缩食，每月存储５０元，已是最高极限，需１００年才能买上两居室。
    商品房价格猛涨，追寻原因，一是经营房地产被看作是最肥的行当。几年来，各类房产公司蜂拥而上，全国陡然间出现２７００多家。当然，不少房产公司为发展商品房建设作出了贡献，功不可没，但也有贪图享利、干坑骗消费者勾当的，遍地拉线，到处拆建，违法违纪严重。二是制订价格构成缺乏相应的政策法规，各自为政，极不统一，有的规定为１０项，有的则十几项。基本造价之外，还有居委会、派出所、商店、中小学、幼儿园、公园、卫生所、道路等等的配套设施费用竟相当于基本造价的两倍甚至３倍多。今后商品房的成本计算、价格、利润将受到法律约束。
