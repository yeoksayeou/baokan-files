Reportage literature has surged in the Chinese literary world, making reportage literature publications extremely popular. Yesterday, the Beijing Xinhua Bookstore in Wangfujing sold over 1,200 sets of "Freedom Memorandum" and "Defeat in Seoul" in just over two hours.

Some say that when future literary historians summarize the situation of the Chinese literary world in 1988, they will definitely place reportage literature in the top spot. Take, for example, the "Chinese Wave" essay contest launched last year by 108 periodicals. In just one year, outstanding reportage literature works emerged one after another, with nearly a thousand pieces reflecting the new look of reform on various fronts, which sparked a heated response both domestically and internationally.

Critic Feng Mu commented, "Fortunately, the rise of reportage literature has brought some vitality to our contemporary literary world." Zhang Guangnian called on writers to "use this auspicious energy to change the declining trend in some corners of the literary world."

Today's reportage literature works have shifted from mainly writing about one person or one event to focusing on major social and historical issues. By confronting society and life and hitting the nail on the head, they have touched the hearts of millions of readers. Various reportage literature publications released by publishers across the country last year were very popular. After "Global Linkup" was published in "Contemporary" magazine, another 100,000 copies were printed as a standalone book. A private book dealer said, "If my daily sales are 1,000 yuan, at least 200 yuan comes from reportage literature."

The Chinese Social Sciences Publishing House released "Freedom Memorandum" and "Defeat in Seoul," which are collections of reportage literature by Su Xiaokang and Zhao Yu, respectively. At the launch event, Beijing No. 166 Middle School student Qiu Chengyu told reporters, "Reportage literature has the effect of awakening the world. My peers around me all like to read it." Shanghai No. 5 Wool Textile Factory engineer Xiao Genfa, who was in Beijing on business, put it more bluntly: "Whether you are male or female, old or young, as long as you care about the future of the country and the fate of the nation, you will love this kind of work." A cadre from a certain unit of the Air Force bought 14 sets of books. He expressed the wishes of many readers: "Many works boldly raise questions, but we hope to see the problems solved."

However, Yu Shunqiao, the president of the Chinese Social Sciences Publishing House, believes that editing and publishing such books should avoid being "all in a rush." It is necessary to analyze and select, and pay attention to social effects. Because currently, some reportage literature works still have problems such as piling up materials, being bloated and cumbersome, and lacking literary quality.

### 直面社会人生　一扫文坛颓气  报告文学出版物走俏

　　直面社会人生　一扫文坛颓气    
    报告文学出版物走俏
    新华社北京２月１７日电  （记者李光茹）报告文学在中国文坛勃然兴起，使报告文学出版物异常走俏。昨天北京王府井新华书店首次发行《自由备忘录》和《兵败汉城》，两个多小时竟售出１２００多套。
    有人说，将来文学史家总结１９８８年中国文坛情况时，必定要让报告文学坐头把交椅。仅以去年１０８家期刊联合发起的“中国潮”征文活动为例，一年时间，报告文学佳作迭出，刊出的反映各条战线改革新貌的近千篇作品，在国内外引起热烈反响。
    评论家冯牧对此这样评价：“幸亏报告文学的兴盛，才使我们的当代文坛有些生气。”张光年则呼吁作家们要“借此祥瑞之气，改变文学界某些角落的颓风。”
    当今的报告文学作品已从主要写一个人、一件事，转向宏观的重大社会、历史问题，以直面社会人生、切中时弊，而拨动了亿万读者的心弦。去年各地出版社相继出版的各种报告文学出版物，十分畅销。《当代》杂志发表《世界大串联》后，又印了十万册单行本。一位个体书商说：“如果我一天营业额是１０００块钱，起码有２００块是报告文学的。”
    中国社会科学出版社推出的《自由备忘录》、《兵败汉城》，分别为苏晓康、赵瑜的报告文学集。首发式上，北京１６６中学生邱澄宇对记者说：“报告文学有警醒世人的作用，我周围的伙伴都喜欢读。”出差来京的上海第五毛纺厂工程师肖根发说得更干脆：“无论男女老少，只要是关心国家前途、民族命运的人，都爱看这类作品。”空军某部一位干部买了１４套书，他道出了众多读者的愿望：“许多作品尖锐大胆地提出了问题，但我们更希望看到问题能够解决。”
    然而，中国社会科学出版社社长余顺尧又认为，编辑、出版这类书要切忌“一窝蜂”，要加以分析、选择，注重社会效果。因为目前有些报告文学作品还存在堆砌材料、臃肿庞杂、缺乏文学性等问题。
