Title: Beyond the Logic of Private Ownership

The traditional logic under private ownership is that public property tends to deteriorate faster than private property. This is because no one can care for someone else's property as much as they care for their own, let alone public property. This seems to be an ironclad logic. However, does this logic apply to China's enterprise system reform?

Wang Xiaqiang, deputy director of the Chinese Economic System Reform Research Institute, published an article titled "Beyond the Logic of Private Ownership: Separation of Ownership and Management, Contracting, and Corporate Assets." He believes that China's enterprise system reform should go beyond the logic of private ownership, considering issues beyond the ownership category, and strengthening the management rights of assets to form corporate assets. This is of special importance for the effective operation of public assets. Therefore, he is known as the proponent of the enterprise system reform led by managers.

On January 26, the reporter invited Wang Xiaqiang to discuss this view. Unfortunately, he was about to go to the United States for further studies, and in a hurry, he could only chat with the reporter over the phone.

When it comes to the idea that no one can care for someone else's property as much as they care for their own, Wang Xiaqiang believes that this logic is valid but only applies to traditional private ownership. In a developed commodity economy, the situation has changed significantly. The subject of asset appreciation has shifted from private owners to entrepreneurs. The driving force behind asset appreciation has shifted from making money to pursuing a career. In the past, whoever owned the assets cared about their appreciation. Now, it doesn't matter whose assets they are; it can't even explain the driving force behind enterprise development. What's important is to have a group of entrepreneurs who make a living from the appreciation of enterprise assets.

The rise of shareholding is a revolution in the Western enterprise system. Wang Xiaqiang said that the significance of this revolution lies in the separation of ownership and management rights. Enterprises become independent legal entities, and enterprise assets become corporate assets, just as shareholders have the right to dispose of their own shares. Enterprises also have the right to dispose of assets accumulated from personal property. Wang Xiaqiang has studied the enterprise systems of the United States and Japan. He said that with the development of shareholding, the ownership of Western enterprises has become highly dispersed. For example, General Motors has tens of thousands of shareholders. The power of individual shareholders has shifted from direct or entrusted management and control to voting in shareholder meetings, and then to "voting with their feet" (selling shares). Stocks are highly liquid, and stock trading has become increasingly frequent. In the past, holding shares was for asset appreciation in a specific enterprise. Now, it has become a means of preserving value or a speculative tool similar to bonds and savings. Japan has even staged a drama of corporate shareholding. In Japan, 65% of the total stock is held by corporations (i.e., organizations distinct from individuals such as enterprises and financial institutions). At this point, any enterprise can no longer be reduced to private ownership. For private owners, using hands or feet to vote is no longer effective. Everything depends on the will of the corporate representative—the manager.

The separation of ownership and management in shareholding companies, by weakening the interference of ownership in enterprise operations, has created a group of entrepreneurs responsible for the appreciation of other people's assets (or even corporate assets whose owners are unclear). Entrepreneurs rely on professional knowledge of asset management and pursue the continuous development of the enterprise. The larger the scale of enterprise development, the greater their power, the higher their status, and the better their lives. Therefore, entrepreneurs pour great enthusiasm into the appreciation of assets that are not their own.

The rise of the entrepreneurial class provides the basis for going beyond the logic of private ownership. Moreover, China's reality cannot afford to wait for private ownership. At the age of 37, Wang Xiaqiang has been down to the countryside, worked as a worker, and since 1978, has been engaged in the theoretical research of economic reform. In his research, he particularly emphasizes starting from China's reality. He said that the biggest reality facing China's enterprise reform is several thousand state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises. Solving China's problems also relies on these enterprises. Surrounding the department store can be individual businesses, but they will not pose a fundamental threat to the department store because no individual business has the power to build another department store. How to privatize state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises? Baosteel has 20 billion yuan in fixed assets, Anshan Steel has 400,000 employees, and the Bank of China handles all foreign exchange business for enterprises, etc. How to privatize them? He advocates leasing or selling small enterprises to private individuals, but what about large enterprises? If the ownership is highly dispersed, with tens of thousands of shareholders, it would be impossible to control the enterprise through ownership, and it would naturally be the manager who leads.

Wang Xiaqiang believes that overemphasizing ownership, thinking that everything will change if ownership changes, is as much of an illusion as believing that implementing public ownership can eliminate the commodity economy. Gradually weakening ownership through contracting, strengthening management rights, and promoting asset movement with corporate assets as the main body may find a realistic path for China's enterprise reform. The key is to create a group of entrepreneurs responsible for assets. This urgently requires solving two problems: first, giving enterprises the possibility of unlimited development. The most effective way to achieve this development is through mergers and acquisitions. Typical commercial enterprises have not developed through their own profits. Second, freeing enterprises from administrative hierarchy and evaluating enterprise cadres independently of administrative evaluation. Enterprises have no superiors, and the status of entrepreneurs is determined in market competition, not by the administrative rank of officials.

    超越私有制逻辑
    本报记者　皮树义
    公家的东西总是比私人的东西坏得快。因为任何人都不可能像对待自己的财产一样关心他人的财产，更不要说公家的东西了。这似乎已是铁的逻辑。然而，这一逻辑是否适合于中国的企业制度改革？
    中国经济体制改革研究所副所长王小强曾发表了《超越私有制逻辑——两权分离、承包与法人资产》一文，认为中国的企业制度改革应当超越私有制逻辑，要考虑所有权范畴之外的诸多问题，为形成法人资产而强化资产的经营权，造就企业家阶层对公有资产有效地运行具有特殊重要意义。因此，被人称为企业制度改革的经营者主导论。１月２６日，记者约请王小强再谈一谈这个观点，不料，他近日就要赴美进修，匆忙中他只好在电话里跟记者“侃了”一通。
    说起任何人都不可能像对待自己的财产一样关心他人的财产，王小强认为，这个逻辑是成立的，但这个逻辑只适合于传统的私有制。在发达的商品经济条件下，情况已有很大变化。资产增殖的主体已由私人所有者转换成企业家。资产增殖的动力由发财转换成事业。过去是谁的资产谁关心增殖，现在资产是谁的并不重要，甚至不能解释企业发展的动力，重要的是有一支吃企业资产增殖这碗饭的企业家队伍。
    股份制的兴起是西方企业制度的一场革命。王小强说，这场革命的意义就在于所有权与经营权的分离，企业成为独立的法人，企业资产成为法人资产，就像持股人有权处理自己的股票一样，企业也有权处理由个人财产集聚成的企业资产。王小强曾考察过美国、日本的企业制度。他说随着股份制的发展，西方企业的股权高度分散化，比如通用汽车公司就有几十万个股东。私人股东的权力从直接或委托经营、控股，在股东大会举手选举经理，逐步落到用脚投票（出卖股票）的境地。股票又有高度流动性，股票买卖越来越频繁。过去，持有股票是为了在某一特定企业实现资产增殖，现在已成为类似于债券、储蓄的保值手段或投机工具。日本干脆演出了一场法人持股的活剧。在日本，股票总额的６５％掌握在法人（即区别于私人的企业、金融机构等组织）手里。这时任何企业都已无法再还原于私人，对于私有者来说，用手、用脚投票全不灵了，一切取决于法人代表——经营者的意志。
    股份公司的两权分离通过弱化所有权对企业经营的干预，为社会造就了一支对他人资产（甚至说不清是谁人的法人资产）增殖负责的企业家队伍。企业家靠的是经营资产的专业知识，追求的是企业的不断发展。因为企业发展的规模越大，他的权力也就越大，地位也就越高，生活也就越好。所以，企业家对并不是自己的资产的增殖倾注了极大的热情。
    企业家阶层的兴起为超越私有制逻辑提供了依据，而且，中国的现实也不能搞，至少不能等待私有制。３７岁的王小强曾插过队，当过工人，从１９７８年以来一直从事经济改革理论的研究。他在研究中特别注重从中国的实际出发。他说，中国的企业改革面对的最大现实是几千个国营大中型企业，要解决中国的问题也靠这些企业。百货大楼周围可以都是个体户，但不会对百货大楼造成根本性的威胁，因为任何个体户都没有力量再盖一座百货大楼。国有大中型企业怎么私有化？宝钢２００亿固定资产，鞍钢４０万职工，中国银行承担了所有企业的外汇业务等等，怎么私有化？他赞成把小企业出租、卖给私人，但大企业怎么办？如果是股权高度分散，股东几十万个，想通过所有权来约束企业也就不可能了，也就自然是经营者主导。
    王小强认为，把所有权看得过重，认为所有权变了，就一切都变了，实际是和以为实行了公有制就可以取消商品经济一样的空想。通过承包逐渐弱化所有权，强化经营权，以法人资产为主体促进资产运动，可能为中国的企业改革找到一条现实的道路。关键是要造就一支对资产负责的企业家队伍。这亟需解决两个问题：一是使企业有无限发展的可能性。这种发展的最有效途径就是兼并。典型商品经济中的大企业没有一个是靠本企业的利润积累发展起来的。二是使企业摆脱行政等级，企业干部脱离行政评价。企业无上级，企业家的地位是在市场竞争中决定的，而不是由行政官员等级来决定。 （附图片）
