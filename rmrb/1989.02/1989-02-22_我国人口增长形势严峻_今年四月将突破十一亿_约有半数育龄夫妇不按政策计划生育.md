	China's population growth situation is severe: population to exceed 11 billion in April
	Approximately half of couples of childbearing age do not follow the policy for planned childbirth

	BEIJING, Feb. 21 (Xinhua) -- How will China's population situation be in 1989? At the national family planning commission directors' meeting that opened today, Peng Peiyun said: In April, China's population will exceed 11 billion!

	The figures left by 1988 are as follows: The total number of births for the year was 22,620,000, the birth rate was 20.78‰, the death rate was 9.58‰, and the natural growth rate was 14.20‰. Compared with 1987, the birth rate and natural growth rate decreased by 0.96 and 0.19 percentage points, respectively. The number of second and multiple births decreased by approximately 1 million each. Although these figures indicate that the trend of increasing birth rates since 1986 has slowed, Peng Peiyun believes that the growth situation remains very severe. The reasons are as follows: The number of women of childbearing age (15-49) nationwide has been increasing by 4 million each year since 1986. By 1997, every year there will be 13 million young women entering the peak childbearing age, nearly double the previous two peaks since the founding of the nation; apart from most urban women who can have only one child, the vast majority of rural women have had two children, and some have had three or more; since the 1980s, China's planned birth rate has been only 50% to 60%.

	The central task of China's family planning work in 1989 is: In accordance with the spirit of the 13th Party Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee, to do a good job in family planning, control population growth, and regard it as an important content that must be firmly grasped in the process of rectifying the economic environment, rectifying the economic order, and comprehensively deepening the reform. Regarding this, Peng Peiyun conveyed the recent emphasis of the State Council leadership that "family planning is a basic state policy formulated by the central government, and all localities must strictly implement it. It is not allowed to have multiple policies, and it is not allowed to open 'new loopholes' on one's own. Those that are inconsistent with the current central policy must submit a formal request report to the central government."

	Peng Peiyun said that in April of this year, when China's population exceeds 11 billion, the "11 Billion Population Day" activity will be held to fully utilize this opportunity to propagandize the population situation and family planning policy to the people of the entire country.

　　我国人口增长形势严峻  今年四月将突破十一亿
    约有半数育龄夫妇不按政策计划生育
    本报北京２月２１日讯  记者艾笑报道：１９８９年，中国的人口形势如何？在今天开幕的全国计生委主任会议上，彭珮云说：４月，我国人口将突破１１亿！
    １９８８年留给我们的底数是：全年出生２２６２万人，人口出生率２０．７８‰，死亡率９．５８‰，自然增长率１４．２０‰。与１９８７年比，人口出生率和自然增长率分别下降了０．９６个千分点和０．１９个千分点，二孩和多孩出生人数各减少了约１００万。虽然，这些数据说明了１９８６年以来人口出生率回升的势头有所减缓，但彭珮云认为，增长的形势仍十分严峻。原因是：全国１５—４９岁育龄妇女人数，自１９８６年开始，正在以每年递增４００万的速度增加。到１９９７年以前，每年都会有１３００万女青年进入生育峰值年龄，比建国以后前两次出生高峰多了近一倍；除城市的大多数妇女能做到只生一个孩子外，广大农村绝大多数妇女都生了两个孩子，一部分还生了三个或更多；８０年代以来，我国的计划生育率只有５０％至６０％。
    １９８９年我国计划生育工作的中心任务是：根据党的十三大和十三届三中全会精神，把做好计划生育工作，控制人口增长，作为治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序和全面深化改革中必须紧紧抓住的一项重要内容。对此，彭珮云转达了最近国务院领导特别强调的“计划生育是中央制定的一项基本国策，各地必须严格执行，决不能政出多门，不允许自行开‘新口子’。凡同中央现行政策不一致的，要向中央写出正式请示报告”的意见。
    彭珮云说，在我国人口突破１１亿的今年４月，将举行１１亿人口日活动，以充分利用这一时机向全国人民宣传人口形势和计划生育政策。
