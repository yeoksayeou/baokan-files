Title: Greetings to Readers

Reading is an integral part of a scholar's life. For young people and adolescents who are currently studying, reading during leisure time is akin to a second classroom, crucial for acquiring knowledge, personal growth, and achieving success. It is indeed not a trivial matter. Today, the sea of books is vast, with both excellent and inferior works intermingled. How can students discern the good from the bad? This column, "Leisure Reading," is newly established to serve as a companion for university students, and occasionally for middle and high school students. It includes sub-sections such as "Scholars Recommend a Book" and "Worth a Try," aiming to recommend and introduce books suitable for students, as well as discuss how to read certain books and analyze the ever-changing trends in student reading. This is a column dedicated to students, and to make it successful, we rely on the support of scholars, publishers, and everyone who cares about the growth of young people, both at home and abroad.
