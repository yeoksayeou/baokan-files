	Prominent Tibetan religious figures pay respects to the body of the Panchen Lama
	The Kumbum Monastery in Qinghai and others hold prayer ceremonies for the passing of the Panchen Lama

	XINHUA, Shigatse, January 31 - (Xinhua News Agency reporter, Central People's Radio reporter) A delegation of Tibetan religious figures, led by the Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Vice President of the Buddhist Association of China, and Honorary President of the Tibet Branch of the Buddhist Association of China, Pagbalha Gelegdanzin, arrived at the Deqing Pochang East Hall, where the Panchen Lama passed away, to pay their respects and offer prayers to the body of the Panchen Lama.

	The delegation, composed of prominent Tibetan religious figures from the Tibet Branch of the Buddhist Association, the three major monasteries of Lhasa, the Jokhang Temple, and the nunneries, traveled from Lhasa to Shigatse. Pagbalha Gelegdanzin first presented a khata on behalf of himself, the Vice President of the Buddhist Association of China, and the President of the Tibet Branch of the Buddhist Association, Choekyi Gyaltsen. Other prominent religious figures, including the Vice President of the Tibet Branch of the Buddhist Association, Togden Jampel Gyatso, also presented khatas. After presenting the khatas, they chanted scriptures and offered prayers with the monks of Tashilhunpo Monastery. Subsequently, Pagbalha Gelegdanzin and his entourage went to Tashilhunpo Monastery to read a prayer text from the Tibet Branch of the Buddhist Association to all the monks. The prayer text expressed the hope that Tashilhunpo Monastery would continue the achievements of the Panchen Lama, uphold the banner of patriotism, love the Communist Party of China, and strive for the unity of the motherland and national unity, and for the prosperity of Buddhism.

	XINHUA, Xining, January 31 - More than 400 monks from Kumbum Monastery, one of the six major monasteries of the Gelugpa sect of Tibetan Buddhism in Qinghai, along with numerous people from various ethnic groups, held a solemn prayer ceremony today for the passing of the Panchen Lama.

	Leaders including the Secretary of the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, Yin Keshen, the Governor of Qinghai Province, Song Ruixiang, the Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Qinghai Provincial People's Congress, Xun Jiaolang, and the Chairman of the Qinghai Provincial Political Consultative Conference, Liu Feng, visited Kumbum Monastery to pay their respects to the late Vice Chairman Panchen.

	Kumbum Monastery is where the Panchen Lama studied scriptures and held the enthronement ceremony. On October 1, 1949, the day the People's Republic of China was founded, the Panchen Lama sent a telegram from Kumbum Monastery to Chairman Mao Zedong and General Zhu De, expressing support for the Central People's Government and the People's Liberation Army, and hoping for the early liberation of Tibet. After liberation, the Panchen Lama would often deliver sermons from the Panchen's throne in the main hall of Kumbum Monastery during his visits to his hometown in Qinghai, promoting patriotic and religious spirit. When the news of the Panchen Lama's passing reached his hometown of Xunhua Salar Autonomous County in Qinghai, the grieving people lit butter lamps to mourn the Panchen Lama's passing according to traditional customs.

	The Panchen Lama was born in 1938 in a Tibetan peasant family in Wendu. On the morning of January 30, 150 monks from Wendu Monastery walked more than 10 kilometers to the Panchen Lama's birthplace, chanting scriptures for liberation and hymns of praise.

    新华社日喀则１月３１日电  （新华社记者、中央人民广播电台记者）由全国政协副主席、中国佛协副会长、中国佛教协会西藏分会名誉会长帕巴拉·格列朗杰率领的西藏宗教界代表团，今天上午前往班禅大师圆寂的德庆颇彰东大殿，向班禅大师的遗体朝拜、祈祷。

    据新华社西宁１月３１日电　藏传佛教格鲁派（即黄教）六大寺院之一青海塔尔寺的喇嘛４００多人以及众多各族群众，今天为班禅大师圆寂举行隆重的祈祷仪式。

    塔尔寺是班禅大师学经和举行坐床典礼的地方。１９４９年１０月１日中华人民共和国成立的当天，班禅大师便从塔尔寺致电毛泽东主席和朱德总司令，表示拥护中央人民政府和中国人民解放军，希望西藏早日获得解放。解放以后，班禅大师每次回青海故乡，都要在塔尔寺大经堂的班禅宝座上讲经，宣扬爱国爱教精神。班禅大师圆寂的噩耗传到班禅大师的故乡青海循化撒拉族自治县文都藏族乡时，悲痛的人们点上了酥油长明灯，以传统的习俗对班禅大师的逝世表示悼念。
    班禅大师１９３８年出生在文都的一户藏族农民家里。１月３０日上午，文都寺１５０名住寺喇嘛，步行１０多公里来到班禅大师的出生地，齐诵超度经和赞诵经。
