The National Patriotic Health Campaign Committee has decided that from this year onwards, April will be designated as the National Patriotic Health Month (specific dates may be adjusted according to local climate conditions). To this end, the committee has recently issued a notice on how to carry out the first National Patriotic Health Month activities.

The notice proposes that during the Patriotic Health Month, all levels of government should hold special meetings to study and approve major policies and guidelines for local patriotic health and disease prevention work for the year; implement specific plans and measures; and allocate manpower, financial resources, and materials. All committee departments should take responsibility for checking the implementation of their assigned tasks and lead by example in maintaining good hygiene. Through these activities, the concept of comprehensive hygiene should be strengthened, and patriotic health work should be carried out in a deep and sustained manner.

The notice calls for a comprehensive and high-profile campaign to improve the environment and eliminate hygiene blind spots; strengthen supervision and inspection of food hygiene and public places; thoroughly carry out the "Four Pests Campaign" (rats, flies, mosquitoes, and bedbugs); and systematically organize activities to create hygienic units, cities, counties, and regions. It also calls for active promotion of hygiene education; guiding the masses to change unhealthy behaviors, establish good hygiene habits, and improve their knowledge and skills in hygiene and self-health care.

Regarding the focus of this year's National Patriotic Health Month activities, the notice makes the following arrangements: In cities, efforts should be made to improve the hygiene of public places; the railway and transportation departments should focus on improving the hygiene of trains, buses, and stations and docks; toilets should be built and managed well, especially in tourist cities and scenic areas where public toilets should meet hygiene standards; mosquito and fly breeding grounds should be handled properly, and rat extermination activities should be carried out. In rural areas, efforts should be made to manage the hygiene of markets; and to improve water supply and rat extermination.

The focus of propaganda and education activities is on smoking and health, food hygiene knowledge, the relationship between water and diseases, and the safety and hygiene of water sources.
