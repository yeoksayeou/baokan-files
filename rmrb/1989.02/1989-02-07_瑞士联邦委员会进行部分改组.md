The Swiss Federal Council underwent a partial reorganization on the 4th. The former Minister of Defense, Keller, took over as the Minister of Justice and Police.

This reorganization took place after Keller was elected as the Vice Chairman of the Federal Council, replacing Kopp, on the 1st. The former Vice Chairman and Minister of Police and Justice, Kopp, resigned at the end of last year due to a scandal involving the leaking of corporate secrets to her husband.

Meanwhile, Villiger, who was elected as a member of the Federal Council on the 1st, took over as the Minister of Defense, replacing Keller.

The Swiss Federal Council is composed of seven members, with the Chairman and Vice Chairman serving in rotation for a term of one year. The members of the Council are also members of the Cabinet.
