A cup of plain tea for auditing, two empty sleeves returning to the office. Weifang City Audit Bureau is praised as a "clean office."

New China News Agency, Jinan, February 11 (Reporters Yin Jianhua, Correspondent Xue Weisheng) Weifang City Audit Bureau educates its staff to strictly adhere to professional ethics and discipline, achieving "a cup of plain tea for auditing, two empty sleeves returning to the office." It is praised by the people as a "clean office."

Not accepting invitations or gifts has become an ironclad rule in Weifang Audit Bureau. Last October, several auditors from the bureau went to an external trade company to perform an audit. Upon returning, they found several barrels of peanut oil in the car. The manager who saw them off said, "Each of you gets a barrel of oil, as a token of appreciation." The auditors immediately unloaded the barrels of oil and politely declined. When they conducted audits in some units within the city, they would drink a cup of plain tea during work hours and go home for meals, not eating at the audited units.

Statistics show that in the five years since its establishment, Weifang City Audit Bureau has audited 210 units, uncovering 39.94 million yuan in violations, and to date, there have been no instances of auditors eating at the audited units or accepting gifts.

Weifang City Audit Bureau places great importance on institutional building, using rules to ensure the bureau's integrity. They have formulated "Professional Ethics Standards for Auditors" and made specific regulations regarding issues that may arise during the execution of audit supervision tasks. Every time auditors go to an audited unit, they hand over the audit notice and announce the audit discipline, asking the audited unit to supervise and jointly adhere to the rules. Since the implementation of audits on enterprises, the bureau's staff have declined over 200 invitations from audited units and refused gifts from over 100 units.

Implementing public supervision is a key factor in Weifang Audit Bureau's ability to maintain integrity. After completing an audit of a unit, the bureau's party branch sends a feedback form or holds a meeting to understand whether the auditors were honest during the enterprise audit.

　　一杯清茶搞审计　两袖清风回机关   
     潍坊市审计局被誉为“清水衙门”
    新华社济南２月１１日电  （记者尹建华、通讯员薛维升）潍坊市审计局教育干部严守职业道德和职业纪律，做到“一杯清茶搞审计，两袖清风回机关”，被人们誉为“清水衙门”。
    不吃请，不受礼，这在潍坊审计局成为铁的纪律。去年１０月，市局几名审计人员到外贸一家公司执行审计任务。返回时，大家发现车里多了几塑料桶花生油。送行的经理说：“给每人一桶油，表示一点心意。”审计人员当即搬下一只只油桶，婉言谢绝。他们在本市一些单位搞审计，都是上班时泡一杯清茶，吃饭时各自回家，不在被审计单位吃饭。
    据统计，潍坊市审计局建局５年，共审计２１０个单位，查出违纪金额３９９４万元，到目前没有发现在被审计单位吃招待饭、接受礼品等问题。
    潍坊市审计局十分重视制度建设，用制度保证机关廉洁。他们制定了“审计工作人员职业道德规范”，并针对在执行审计监督任务中容易出现的问题作出有关规定。审计人员每到一个被审计单位，边交审计通知书，边宣布审计纪律，请被审计单位监督，共同遵守。对企业实行审计以来，这个局的机关工作人员，谢绝被审计单位宴请２００余次，拒收上百个单位的礼品。
    实行公开监督，是潍坊审计局能够保持廉洁的关键一环。他们每审计完一个单位，局党支部都向被审单位发征求意见书或开座谈会，了解审计人员在企业审计期间是否廉洁。
