In 1987, I purchased a "Friendship" brand washing machine produced by the Yingkou Washing Machine Factory from the Yanbian National Trade Company. In October 1988, the dewatering bucket of the washing machine developed a fault. Since there was no authorized repair station from the manufacturer in my residential area, I wrote a letter to the service department of the Yingkou Washing Machine Factory, asking how to eliminate the fault in the dewatering bucket so that I could find someone to repair it. Unexpectedly, on November 17, Comrade Liu from the factory's service department came to my workplace. At that time, I was attending a meeting at another unit and was scheduled to go on a business trip the next day. Upon learning of this, Comrade Liu immediately found me at the meeting place.

After Comrade Liu repaired the washing machine, he also taught me some methods for using and maintaining the washing machine. When I expressed my gratitude to him, he repeatedly said: "This is what the factory should do." I am fortunate to have bought a "Friendship" brand washing machine, because the Yingkou Washing Machine Factory also gives friendship to its users.

　　营口洗衣机厂服务态度好
    热情把友谊送给用户
    １９８７年，我从延边民族贸易公司购买了一台营口洗衣机厂生产的友谊牌洗衣机。１９８８年１０月，洗衣机脱水桶出现故障。由于我居住地没有厂家的特约维修站，我便给营口洗衣机厂服务科去了一封信，询问如何排除脱水桶的故障，以便找人修理。意想不到的是，１１月１７日，这家厂服务科刘同志竟来到了我的工作单位。当时，我正在外单位开会，第二天又要去外地出差。刘同志得知这一情况，立即寻找到我开会的地方。
    刘同志将洗衣机修好后，还给我讲了一些使用和保养洗衣机的方法。当我向他表示谢意时，他连连说：这是厂家应该做的。我庆幸自己买了友谊牌洗衣机，因为营口洗衣机厂也把友谊给了用户。
