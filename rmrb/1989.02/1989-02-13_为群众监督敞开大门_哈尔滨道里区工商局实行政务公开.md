The Daoli District Administration for Industry and Commerce in Harbin, Heilongjiang Province, has implemented administrative transparency since last year, opening up in various aspects to accept public oversight and ensuring the cleanliness and integrity of officials at every level.

In March last year, the Daoli District Administration for Industry and Commerce proposed "publicizing administrative procedures, inviting public scrutiny, and exposing to society," drafting the "Decision on Implementing Eight Publicizations of Administrative Procedures" and the "Regulations on Maintaining the Integrity of Industrial and Commercial Administrative Personnel." They were the first in Harbin to implement the publicization of administrative procedures. In October, they expanded from publicizing one aspect of administrative procedures to publicizing six aspects of administrative affairs, achieving a comprehensive transition from publicizing administrative procedures to publicizing administrative affairs.

	• Publicizing administrative procedures mainly includes publicizing policies and regulations, work procedures, business registration and licensing, case handling, stall application, fee collection, rules and regulations, and organizational structure and responsibilities of personnel.

	• Publicizing leadership decisions involves, before making important decisions that affect the entire district or the personal interests of the public, broadly soliciting opinions from internal staff and relevant external personnel. For decisions with a strong technical nature, thorough scientific verification should be conducted beforehand, and collective discussions should be held when conditions are ripe to reduce decision-making errors.

	• Publicizing the evaluation of industrial and commercial personnel involves making the evaluation of officials open, changing internal evaluations to internal and external evaluations, to improve the transparency and accuracy of evaluating officials.

	• Publicizing the rewards and punishments of officials involves strictly handling officials who violate laws and regulations according to the punishment methods, giving appropriate punishments based on the nature of the errors, and publicizing the handling within the scope of influence.

	• Publicizing internal construction involves publicizing the promotion and use of officials, mobilizing the entire bureau's officials for evaluation, and not relying solely on the chief's decision; publicizing the welfare and benefits of employees, listening to the opinions of employees in the formulation and specific implementation of standards for bonuses, housing, and hardship allowances, striving for fairness and reasonableness.

	• Publicizing the supervision mechanism mainly involves improving the organizational structure, establishing a supervision responsibility system, appointing voluntary supervisors from relevant social personnel to supervise the law enforcement of industrial and commercial personnel, and establishing a reporting system.

After implementing administrative transparency, the Daoli District Administration for Industry and Commerce has achieved significant results in convenience for the public and clean governance, effectively solving problems that the public has strongly reflected. In the past, there were varying degrees of delays, obstructions, and pressures in industrial and commercial administrative work, especially in business registration and licensing, where public complaints were significant. After publicizing administrative affairs, the sense of responsibility of management personnel has significantly increased, and the phenomena of delays, obstructions, and pressures have been basically eliminated. Now, there are more praises and fewer criticisms for industrial and commercial personnel; there are more responsible officials and fewer officials who just go through the motions; there are more officials who refuse gifts and bribes, and illegal activities have significantly decreased. Statistics show that since last year, the entire bureau's officials and staff have refused 115 gifts and bribes, totaling 23,195 yuan, and refused 790 invitations to eat. Last year, the entire bureau investigated and dealt with 33 cases of speculation and profiteering, confiscating counterfeit goods worth nearly 500,000 yuan, handled 43 economic contract disputes, and helped enterprises recover overdue payments totaling 12,350,000 yuan. In terms of market construction, they invested 2.8 million yuan to build four new markets, renovated and expanded three markets, increasing the business area by 7,000 square meters, adding 700 stalls, and arranging jobs for 1,500 urban and rural unemployed and idle people, promoting the development of the entire district's economy.

### 为群众监督敞开大门  哈尔滨道里区工商局实行政务公开

　　为群众监督敞开大门    
    哈尔滨道里区工商局实行政务公开
    本报讯  黑龙江省哈尔滨市道里区工商局去年以来实行政务公开，从各个角度为接受群众监督敞开了大门，从各个环节为保持干部清政廉洁提供了保证。
    去年３月，道里区工商局提出了“公开办事制度，请群众透视，向社会曝光”，制订了“关于实行办事制度八公开的决定”、“关于工商行政管理人员保持廉洁的规定”，在哈尔滨市率先实行办事公开制度。去年１０月，他们又由办事制度公开的一个方面拓宽到政务公开６个方面，实现了由办事制度公开向政务公开的全面过渡。
    ——公开办事制度，主要是指政策法规公开、工作程序公开、登记办（验）照公开、查处案件公开、摊位受理公开、规费收取公开、规章制度公开、机构设置和工作人员职责公开。
    ——公开领导决策，是在制订关系到全区、全局大事和群众切身利益的重要决策之前，都要广泛征求局内干部职工和局外各有关方面人士的意见；对制订某些技术性较强的决策，事前要进行充分的科学论证，在条件成熟后由集体讨论决定，以减少决策失误。
    ——公开工商干部评议，对干部考核和评议实行开放式，变内部评议为内外评议，以提高评议干部的透明度和准确度。
    ——公开干部奖惩，对违法乱纪的干部要按处罚办法严肃处理，其错误是什么性质就给什么处分，其影响波及到什么范围，就在什么范围内公开处理。
    ——公开内务建设，一是对干部的提拔使用公开，发动全局干部评议，不搞首长一锤定音；二是职工福利待遇公开，评奖金、分房、困难补助等标准的制订和具体实施都要听取职工的意见，力求公正合理。
    ——公开监督机制，主要是健全机构，建立监督责任制，聘请由社会有关人士参加的义务监督员监督工商干部执法守法，建立举报制度。
    道里区工商局实行政务公开后，在便民、廉政方面取得了较明显的效果，有效地解决了群众反映强烈的问题。过去，工商行政管理工作中存在着不同程度的拖、卡、压问题，特别是在登记办照方面，群众意见较大。公开政务后，管理人员的责任心明显增强，拖、卡、压现象基本杜绝。现在，对工商干部表扬的多了，批评的少了；干部责任心强的多了，混日子的少了；拒礼拒贿的多了，违纪现象明显减少了。据统计，去年以来，全局干部职工拒礼拒贿１１５件，金额达２３１９５元，拒吃请７９０人次。去年，全局共查处各种投机倒把案件３３起，收缴假冒商品价值近５０万元，处理经济合同纠纷４３起，帮助企业追回欠款１２３５万元。在市场建设方面他们投资２８０万元新建４处市场，改造扩建了３处市场，增加经营面积７０００平方米，增加摊床７００个，安置城乡待业浮闲人员１５００人，促进了全区经济的发展。
