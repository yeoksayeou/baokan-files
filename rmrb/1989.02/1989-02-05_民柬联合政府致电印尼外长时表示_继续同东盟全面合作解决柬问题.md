The Democratic Kampuchea United Government recently stated that they guarantee to continue full cooperation with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to find a comprehensive and just solution to the Cambodian issue.

This guarantee was made in a telegram sent by Democratic Kampuchea United Government Prime Minister Son Sann, Democratic Kampuchea Vice Chairman Khieu Samphan, and Prince Norodom Sihanouk's personal representative in Cambodia and Asia, Prince Norodom Sirivudh, to Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas.

The telegram expressed deep gratitude to ASEAN foreign ministers for reaffirming their support for the Cambodian people and the Democratic Kampuchea United Government during their meeting in Brunei on January 21, as well as for their views on the future Cambodian government, which should be independent, neutral, and non-aligned under the leadership of Prince Norodom Sihanouk.

The telegram stated: "Unlike the aggressors, we, the victims of aggression, truly hope for a swift political solution, as indicated by Prince Norodom Sihanouk's five-point peace plan. This political solution should ensure the complete withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Cambodia and the formation of a quadripartite provisional government led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk as the first step towards national reconciliation in Cambodia."

The telegram pointed out that Vietnam and its puppet regime in Phnom Penh have created one problem after another and attempted to link these problems with the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Cambodia. This attempt can only be seen as a ploy by Vietnam to avoid withdrawing its troops from Cambodia. The telegram said: "We believe there is no need to link the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Cambodia with other issues. Because, once the withdrawal is completed under effective international supervision, other issues will definitely be resolved quickly."

The telegram concluded: "We will attend the second informal meeting in Jakarta."

### 民柬联合政府致电印尼外长时表示　继续同东盟全面合作解决柬问题

　　民柬联合政府致电印尼外长时表示
　　继续同东盟全面合作解决柬问题
    新华社曼谷２月３日电  民主柬埔寨联合政府的代表最近表示，他们保证继续同东南亚国家联盟进行全面合作，以寻找一项全面和公正解决柬埔寨问题的办法。
    这一保证是民柬联合政府总理宋双、民柬副主席乔森潘和西哈努克亲王驻柬埔寨和亚洲的私人代表拉那列王子最近在打给印度尼西亚外长阿拉塔斯的一封电报中做出的。
    电报对东盟国家外长在１月２１日于文莱举行的会议上重申支持柬埔寨人民和民柬联合政府，以及对他们关于未来的柬埔寨政府应是在西哈努克亲王领导下的独立、中立和不结盟的看法，表示深切的感谢。
    电报说：“同侵略者不同，我们被侵略者非常希望有一个迅速的政治解决办法，正如西哈努克亲王的五点和平方案所表明的那样，这一政治解决办法应将确保越南军队全部撤出柬埔寨，并通过组成以西哈努克亲王为领导的四方临时政府作为达到整个柬埔寨民族和解的第一步。”
    电报指出，越南和它扶植的金边政权制造了一个又一个的问题，并试图把这些问题同越南军队撤出柬埔寨联系起来。这种企图只能被认为是越南不想从柬埔寨撤军的花招。电报说：“我们认为没有必要把越南从柬埔寨撤军同其他问题联系在一起。因为，在有效国际监督下的撤军一旦完成，其他问题也就一定会迅速解决。”
    电报最后说：“我们将出席第二次雅加达非正式会议。”
