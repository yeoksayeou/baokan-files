In the depths of winter, the northern regions are already covered in ice and snow, but the border city of Kunming remains lush and green. Especially in the bustling vegetable markets of the city's streets and alleys, it is as if an oasis has appeared in the midst of the bustling city.

Every day, the city supplies approximately 500,000 kilograms of fresh vegetables, with over 30 varieties. From the early morning when the sky is just beginning to lighten, until the sunset, the market is always bustling with activity. The city's secretary, Ma Li, told reporters: "To ensure a stable supply of vegetables, we must focus on the vegetable fields and activate the vegetable stalls, so that the vegetable basket can remain green all year round."

**Strategies for Managing "Vegetable Fields"**

Residents of Kunming enjoy fresh vegetables all year round. Therefore, protecting the 30,000 mu of vegetable fields on the outskirts of the city has become a prerequisite for stabilizing the vegetable supply. In recent years, urban construction has required more and more land, seriously threatening the vegetable fields on the outskirts. In response to this "encroachment," the city government has strictly regulated that anyone who appropriates vegetable fields on the outskirts must first cultivate an equivalent area of vegetable fields and pay 10,000 yuan per mu in "vegetable field development fees." The 8,500 mu of vegetable fields at the junction of the city and the suburbs have been included in the city's overall planning, with boundaries marked and laws enacted to protect them. Until the year 2000, no unit or individual is allowed to occupy them for any reason, making it the first "vegetable protection zone" in the country. Last August, 35 households of vegetable farmers built houses in the "protection zone" without authorization and were immediately severely punished according to the "protection law."

Kunming has four months of the year when vegetables are in short supply. Since 1986, the city government has consciously used economic levers in deepening rural reforms to fundamentally solve the problem of eating vegetables during the off-season in the city. Every year before the "spring off-season" arrives, they arrange for 2,000 mu of vegetable planting; before the "autumn off-season" arrives, they arrange for 3,000 mu; and before the Spring Festival, they arrange for 700 to 1,000 mu of "festival vegetables." To ensure the implementation of the plan, the municipal finance department and the vegetable company allocate more than 500,000 yuan annually to subsidize vegetable farmers and provide appropriate rewards to rural cadres, urging them to care for the construction of "vegetable fields."

**Tactics for Activating "Vegetable Stalls"**

In recent years, some state-run vegetable outlets in certain cities have collapsed under the pressure of the "shoulder pole army," while others, although still in operation, have very few vegetables on their shelves. The 130-plus state-run vegetable outlets in Kunming, however, have not only not collapsed but have become the main force in revitalizing the vegetable market and stabilizing vegetable prices. Their "secret" is to manage the off-season and release during the peak season; to manage large varieties and release small varieties; to manage the maximum market price and minimum purchase price, and to open up floating prices within this range. On this basis, they allow farmers to "each go their own way," activating the vegetable market.

To activate the market and stabilize vegetable prices, the Kunming municipal finance department allocates more than 600,000 yuan annually to stabilize prices when vegetable prices soar and to protect the interests of vegetable farmers when prices plummet. They focus on spending money effectively. The city has an average of 35 varieties of vegetables on the market each year, with as many as 50-plus varieties at times. However, as long as they control the six "mainstay" vegetables such as cabbage, they can basically ensure that citizens have vegetables to eat and stabilize vegetable prices. Last September, Kunming experienced both drought and flooding, significantly reducing vegetable yields. The price of cabbage soared from 2 jiao per kilogram to 8 jiao, affecting the prices of various vegetables. At this time, the municipal vegetable company allocated more than 700,000 yuan, purchasing vegetables from outside the city at 6 jiao per kilogram and selling them in Kunming at 4.5 jiao per kilogram. In less than half a month, vegetable prices in the city dropped. In December, when the price of cabbage fell to a few fen per kilogram, the municipal vegetable company allocated more than 500,000 yuan, purchasing cabbage at 1 jiao 2 fen per kilogram to boost prices and protect the interests of vegetable farmers.

**Measures to Protect the "Vegetable Basket"**

Kunming has limited arable land, which restricts the expansion of "vegetable fields," and can only rely on scientific and technological progress to increase production to ensure that the vegetable basket remains green all year round.

In recent years, the Kunming municipal government has invested more than 100 million yuan to renovate the irrigation systems of vegetable fields on the outskirts of the city; allocated special funds for scientific experiments to pave the way for the popularization of scientific vegetable cultivation. A team of more than 110 vegetable technology experts has been working year-round in the vegetable-growing areas, guiding farmers to use plastic film covering, hybrid seeds, and advanced cultivation techniques to significantly increase vegetable yields. In the past, cabbage, lotus root, and cucumbers were seasonal vegetables, but now they can be grown almost all year round. Many fine varieties of vegetables, such as green peppers and garlic sprouts, are now harvested 10 to 20 days earlier than before, shortening the off-season period and enriching the people's "vegetable basket."

Last year, the 30,000 mu of planned vegetable fields in Kunming had an average yield of 7,400 kilograms per mu, an increase of 50% compared to 1985. According to statistics from the Ministry of Commerce, among the 37 large and medium-sized cities in the country, Kunming's vegetables are not only abundant in quantity and variety but also cheap in price.

Relying on science and technology to develop production, Kunming has not only ensured that the people's "vegetable basket" remains green all year round but has also made a significant contribution to the "vegetable basket" of 117 cities, regions, and units across the country. Currently, the Yunnan vegetable base, with Kunming as the "dragon head," has become one of the three major bases for winter and spring early vegetables of the Ministry of Commerce. Last year, Yunnan shipped 187 million kilograms of vegetables to various parts of the country, nearly doubling the previous year's figure. In the ranks of "southern vegetables going north," Yunnan has risen from the 7th position to the 3rd.

　　为了群众的“菜篮子”   
    ——昆明市解决蔬菜供应见闻录
    新华社记者  徐祖根  高晓虎
    隆冬时节，北国早已冰天雪地，可边城昆明依然满目青翠。特别是那大街小巷的菜市场，更似闹市中的“绿洲”。
    每天，全市上市的新鲜蔬菜约５０万公斤，品种达３０多个。从清晨天蒙蒙亮，一直到夕阳西下，菜市上始终车水马龙，熙熙攘攘。市政府秘书长马力对记者说：“抓好菜园子，搞活菜摊子，菜篮子才能四季长青”。
    　　　　抓“菜园子”有绝招
    昆明的居民春夏秋冬都讲究吃新鲜菜。因此，保住近郊３万多亩“菜园子”，成了稳定“菜篮子”的先决条件。近几年来，城市建设征地越来越多，严重威胁着近郊的“菜园子”。针对“蚕食风”，市政府硬性规定，无论谁征用近郊菜地，都要先种好一块与征用面积相同的菜地，每亩还要交１万元“菜田建设费”。位于城郊接合部的８５００亩菜地纳入城市总体规划，划界树碑，立法保护，２０００年以前不准任何单位和个人以任何理由占用，使之成为全国第一片“蔬菜保护区”。去年８月，有３５户菜农私自在“保护区”内建房，立即按“保护法”被从严查处。
    昆明每年有４个月是蔬菜淡季。１９８６年以来，市政府在深化农村改革中，自觉运用经济杠杆，从根本上解决城市淡季吃菜的问题。每年“春淡”来临前，他们早早安排２０００亩种菜计划；“秋淡”来临前，再安排３０００亩；春节前，还要安排７００亩至１０００亩的“节日菜”。为了确保计划实施，市财政和蔬菜公司每年拿出５０多万元补贴菜农，也给乡村干部适当奖励，督促他们关心“菜园子”建设。
    　　　　搞活“菜摊子”有窍门
    近年来，一些城市的国营蔬菜网点在“扁担大军”的冲击下，有的垮了，有的虽然门面还在，可货架上的蔬菜很少。昆明市的１３０多个国营蔬菜网点在开放搞活中，不仅没有垮掉，相反成了繁荣菜市、稳定菜价的主力军。他们的“窍门”是，管淡季放旺季；管大品种放小品种；管市场最高限价和最低收购价，放开在此范围内的浮动价。在这个基础上让农民“八仙过海”，搞活蔬菜市场。
    为了搞活市场，稳定菜价，昆明市财政每年拿出６００多万元用于在菜价暴涨时平抑物价，暴跌时保护菜农利益。他们注重把钱用在刀刃上。全市每年蔬菜上市品种平均３５个，多的时候有５０多个。然而，只要管住大白菜等６种“大路货”，就能基本保证市民吃菜，还能稳定菜价。去年９月，昆明先旱后涝，菜田大幅度减产。大白菜从每公斤２角暴涨到８角，牵动各种蔬菜价格上涨。这时，市蔬菜公司拿出７０多万元，以每公斤６角的收购价从外地进菜，４．５角一公斤投入昆明市场。不到半个月，全市蔬菜价格下跌。１２月，大白菜的价格跌到几分钱１公斤，市蔬菜公司又拿出５０多万元，以每公斤１角２分收购大白菜，促使菜价回升，以保护菜农利益。
    　　　　保“菜篮子”有措施
    昆明市耕地有限，限制了“菜园子”的扩大，只有依靠科学技术提高产量，才能保证菜篮子四季长青。
    近年来，昆明市政府先后投资１００多万元，改造了近郊菜田的排灌系统；拨出专款搞科学试验，为普及科学种菜示范开路。一支１１０多人的蔬菜科技队伍，长年在菜区指导农民搞地膜覆盖，采用杂交良种，推广先进的栽培技术，使蔬菜大幅度增产。过去，大白菜、莲花白、黄瓜等都是季节菜，现在基本上全年都可种植。青辣椒、蒜薹等许多细菜品种，也比过去提前１０天至２０天上市，缩短了淡季周期，丰富了群众的“菜篮子”。
    去年，昆明３万多亩计划内菜田，平均亩产７４００公斤，比１９８５年增产５０％。据商业部统计，在全国３７个大、中城市中，昆明的蔬菜不仅量大品种多，而且价格便宜。
    依靠科技发展生产，昆明市不仅保证了群众的“菜篮子”四季长青，还为全国１１７个城市、地区和单位的“菜篮子”做出了贡献。目前，以昆明为“龙头”的云南蔬菜基地，已经成为商业部冬春早菜的三大基地之一。去年云南调往全国各地的蔬菜达１．８７亿公斤，比上年增加近２倍。在南菜北运的行列中，云南已由第７位上升到第３位。
