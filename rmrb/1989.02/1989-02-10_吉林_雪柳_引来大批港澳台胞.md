During the Spring Festival, batches of compatriots from Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan came to the northern city of Jilin to admire the famous "snow willow."

At that time, the willows along the Songhua River embankment were covered with frost and snow. From a distance, they looked like clusters of white clouds and rows of snow waves; up close, they resembled pearls cascading and snow butterflies fluttering. The entire embankment seemed like a world of jade and glass. According to the Jilin City tourism department, the number of Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan compatriots coming to admire this wonder has been increasing year by year. This Spring Festival, nearly 10,000 people are expected to visit, with over 5,000 people alone expected to be received from the first to the fifth day of the lunar new year.

Many service staff at the Dongguan, Xiguang, Jiangcheng, and Yinhua hotels in Jilin City gave up the opportunity to reunite with their families during the Spring Festival to warmly receive the compatriots coming to visit and travel. To ensure that the compatriots have a good time, the Jilin City government also invested in improving the facilities and conditions at the ski resort and Songhua Lake, adding snowmobile and ice lantern projects. The Jilin City Travel Service Corporation publicly recruited and trained a batch of amateur guides with good qualities.

　　吉林“雪柳”引来大批港澳台胞
    新华社长春２月９日电  （通讯员张书春、记者陈美凤）春节期间，一批批港澳台同胞来到北国江城——吉林市，观赏遐迩闻名的奇景“雪柳”。
    届时，松花江堤上的垂柳，凝霜挂雪。远眺，如团团白云、排排雪浪；近观，如珍珠倾泻、雪蝶轻飞，整个江堤好似琼瑶琉璃世界一般。据吉林市旅游部门介绍，来这里观赏奇景的港澳台同胞逐年增多。今年春节前后将达近万人，仅大年初一到初五，就要接待５０００余人。
    吉林市东关、西关、江城和银花４家大宾馆的许多服务人员放弃新春与家人团聚的良辰，热情接待前来观光旅游的港澳台胞。为了让同胞们玩好，吉林市政府还投资改善了滑雪场、松花湖等游览点的设施和条件，增加了雪地摩托艇、冰灯花灯等项目。吉林市中旅社公开招聘并训练了一批素质好的业余导游员。
