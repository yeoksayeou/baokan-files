In a situation where the national financial policy is tight, the Yichun region of Jiangxi Province has insisted on taking farmers' investments as the mainstay, establishing a "hundred springs converging, multi-channel fundraising" investment system, and gathering funds for agricultural development. Over the past five years, the entire region has afforested 2,570,000 mu of barren hills, developed 500,000 mu of water surfaces, renovated 710,000 mu of low-yield fish ponds, and renovated 850,000 mu of orchards and tea gardens, as well as 600,000 mu of medium and low-yield fields.

Yichun region is known as the "granary of Jiangxi" and is one of the most developed agricultural regions in Jiangxi Province. The region still has 800,000 mu of barren hills, 600,000 mu of barren land, and 300,000 mu of water surfaces that have not been developed and utilized. Even the already developed mountain and water resources partially have the problem of low quality and low efficiency. To improve the overall efficiency of agricultural development and the utilization rate of farmland, Yichun region sympathizes with the nation's difficulties, relies on self-accumulation, and gathers funds for agricultural development. Their basic approach is as follows:

	— Dredging deposited funds. Before the implementation of the household contract responsibility system, Yichun region had 600 million yuan of collective accumulations in rural areas, most of which were idle in society, turning active money into dead money. They cleared up the original collective accumulations of more than 200 million yuan through asset verification, settlement of debts and claims, and other methods, and implemented village-level management or team-level management, hierarchical ownership, and hierarchical use. Most of the funds were used for agricultural development, turning dead money into active money.

	— Levying land tax. Since 1987, various levels in Yichun region have strengthened the management of farmland, collected land use fees for non-agricultural land, levied land tax; established a fund for the reclamation of farmland, turning free reclamation into paid development; implemented the collection of mortgage deposits for farmers' house construction and other methods, accumulating a large amount of funds. This fund, in addition to being remitted to the central government according to regulations, is managed uniformly and used hierarchically, mainly for land compensation and agricultural development. Gaoyan County's Jinyang Town's Fenghuang Administrative Village is located in the suburbs. In recent years, it has insisted on transferring various land acquisition fees into the cooperative fund, which is used to develop village-run enterprises, plant citrus and other fruit trees, and increase the development fund from more than 10 million yuan in 1986 to more than 60 million yuan last year.

	— Gathering idle social funds. The agricultural, forestry, water, and financial departments of Yifeng County organized three administrative villages to jointly develop barren hills, raising 16 million yuan, and established a 3,000 mu Shupu Fruit Garden. The county is responsible for providing technology and product sales, the township and village levels are responsible for land adjustment and labor provision, and hired a citrus farmer from Zhejiang to operate the garden. Now, 1,000 mu of barren hills and land have been developed, and more than 60,000 citrus trees have been planted.

	— Introducing funds from outside the region. Through the method of compensatory trade, actively introducing external funds to develop local characteristic famous and superior products, and implementing series development. Such as the canned bamboo shoots from Tonggu, the sewing machine table from Yifeng, the bagged shiitake mushrooms, kiwifruit, and plywood from Jing'an, Fengxin, and other counties, have all introduced funds through compensatory trade and other forms, expanding production capacity.

	— Local finance increases revenue and saves expenditure to raise funds for agricultural development. Yichun region squeezes out more than 10 million yuan every year for agricultural development. Last year, another 15 million yuan was allocated as special funds to introduce excellent seedlings, renovate low-yield orchards and tea gardens, and develop bamboo shoots, citrus, and vegetable projects.

　　体恤国家困难　依靠自身积累
　　宜春多渠道集资开发农业
    本报讯  新华社记者熊典达、通讯员袁志成报道：在国家银根紧缩的情况下，江西省宜春地区坚持以农民投资为主体，建立起“百泉汇流，多渠道集资”的投资体系，为农业开发广聚资金。近５年来，全区共绿化荒山２５７万亩，开发水面５万亩，改造低产鱼塘７．１万亩，改造果园茶园８．５万亩，改造中低产田６０万亩。
    宜春地区誉称“赣中粮仓”，是江西省农业发达地区之一。全区还有８０万亩荒山、６０万亩荒地、３０万亩水面尚未得到开发利用，即使是已经开发的山水资源也部分存在质次效益低的问题，为了提高农业开发的整体效益和农用土地利用率，宜春地区体恤国家困难，依靠自身积累，为农业开发积累资金。他们的基本做法是：
    ——打捞沉淀资金。实行家庭联产承包责任制前，宜春地区农村原有集体积累６０００多万元，这些资金大部分闲散在社会上，活钱变成了死钱。他们通过清产核资，落实债权债务等办法，共清理出原有集体积累２０００多万元，并实行村有乡管或组有村管，分级所有，分级使用，大部分用于农业的开发，将死钱变成了活钱。
    ——开征土地税。从１９８７年开始，宜春地区各级切实加强了农用土地的管理，通过开征非农用占地使用费，收取土地税；建立宜农用地垦复基金，变无偿垦复为有偿开发；实行农民建房收缴抵押金等办法，积累了大批资金。这笔资金除按规定上缴中央财政外，留下的实行统一管理，分级使用，主要用于土地补偿和农业开发。高安县筠阳镇凤凰行政村地处城郊，近几年来坚持把各种征地费转入合作基金会，用于发展村办企业、栽种柑桔等果木林，发展基金由１９８６年的１０多万元增加到去年的６０多万元。
    ——集聚社会闲散资金。宜丰县农、林、水、财四个主管局组织三个行政村联合开发荒山，集资１６０万元，办起了一个面积３０００亩的石埠果园场，县负责提供技术和产品销售，乡村两级负责调整土地和提供劳力，聘请浙江桔农承包经营，现已开发荒山荒地１０００亩，栽植柑桔６万余株。
    ——引进外地资金。通过补偿贸易的办法积极引进外资，发展有地方特色的名优产品，实行系列开发。像铜鼓的清水笋罐头，宜丰缝纫机台板，靖安、奉新等县的袋装香菇、猕猴桃、竹胶合板等产品的开发，都先后通过补偿贸易等形式引进了资金，扩大了生产能力。
    ——地方财政开源节流，为农业开发筹措资金。宜春地区每年都要挤出１００万元以上的资金用于农业开发。去年又拨出１５０万元专项经费用于引进良种苗木，改造低产果茶园，开发笋用林、柑桔和蔬菜等项目。
