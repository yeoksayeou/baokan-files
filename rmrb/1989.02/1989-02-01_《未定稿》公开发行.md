The Unfinished Draft, an internal academic journal published by the China Social Sciences Magazine, has, over the course of its 10-year history, been at the forefront of discussions and debates on many major theoretical and academic issues. In 1989, the journal, in order to broaden the scope of its explorations and debates, and to uphold the spirit of "everything is undecided, awaiting exploration," has changed from a fortnightly to a monthly publication and will now be publicly distributed.
