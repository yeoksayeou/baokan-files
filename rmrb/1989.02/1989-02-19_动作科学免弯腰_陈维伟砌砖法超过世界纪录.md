Engineer Chen Weiwei of the Tianjin Railway Bureau Construction Science Department has spent over 30 years researching and combining traditional Chinese bricklaying techniques with modern management science. He has created the "2381" bricklaying method. Building experts have identified this as a revolution in China's bricklaying history.

The "2381" bricklaying method integrates the strengths of various Chinese bricklaying techniques. It follows the physiological activity rules of the five human actions involved in bricklaying: hand, eye, body, method, and step. This simplifies the complex bricklaying process into scientific and standardized actions, ensuring construction quality and improving labor efficiency. It includes two types of steps, three types of body movements, eight types of mortar spreading methods, and one type of mortar squeezing action, hence the name "2381" bricklaying method.

Traditional bricklaying methods require 18 actions to lay one brick, while this new method requires only 3-4 actions. It allows for laying over 400 bricks per hour, surpassing the world record of 360 bricks set by the famous American management scholar Gilbreth. This method is simple and easy to learn; ordinary workers can independently operate after just three months of training. The bricklaying efficiency can exceed the national quota by onefold, and it eliminates the need for bending.

It is reported that the "2381" bricklaying method has begun to be promoted in 20 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions nationwide. Currently, tens of thousands of bricklayers across the country have mastered this scientific bricklaying method.

　　动作科学免弯腰
    陈维伟砌砖法超过世界纪录
    据新华社天津２月１８日电  （记者张宏文）天津铁路分局基建科工程师陈维伟经过３０多年潜心研究，把我国的传统砌砖技术和现代管理科学融合在一起，创造出“２３８１”砌砖法。建筑专家们鉴定认为，这是我国砌筑史上的一次革命。
    “２３８１”砌砖法集我国各类砌砖法的特长，按照砌筑动作中人体手、眼、身、法、步５种生理活动规律，把繁杂的砌砖作业简化成科学规范的砌砖动作，从而达到保证施工质量、提高劳动效率的目的。它包括２种步法、３种身法、８种铺灰手法和１种挤浆动作，因而简称“２３８１”砌砖法。
    传统的砌筑方法每砌一块砖多达１８个动作，而这种新方法只有３—４个动作，１小时可砌砖４００多块，超过了美国著名管理学者吉尔布雷斯创造的３６０块的世界纪录。这种方法简便易学，普通工人经过３个月的训练即可独立操作，砌砖效率可超过国家定额１倍，而且可免弯腰之苦。
    据介绍，“２３８１”砌砖法已开始在全国２０个省、市、自治区推广。目前各地已有数万名瓦工掌握了这种科学的砌筑方法。
