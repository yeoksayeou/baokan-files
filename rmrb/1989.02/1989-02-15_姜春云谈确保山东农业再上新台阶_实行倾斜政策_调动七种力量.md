Ma Jianchun on Ensuring Shandong Agriculture Reaches New Heights
Implementing Inclination Policies to Mobilize Seven Forces

Our reporter, Fei Weiwei, reports: Before the Spring Festival, Ma Jianchun, Secretary of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, accepted an interview with our reporter and proposed that for agriculture to reach a new level, it is crucial to break away from the narrow mindset of small-scale farming and to re-evaluate the foundational role of agriculture from the perspective of overall economic development and strategic planning. Currently, Shandong's agriculture is far from meeting the needs of national economic development and the improvement of people's lives. It is imperative to strengthen and elevate agriculture to a new level. Seven forces need to be mobilized.

First, the force of reform and policy. From Shandong's perspective, it is necessary to perfect the "dual-layer management" system to solve problems that individual households cannot address, and to provide comprehensive services before and after production for projects such as water conservancy, seed improvement, and the promotion of new technologies.

Second, the force of science and technology. Science and technology are productive forces. This year, Shandong will promote 11 new technologies. Just by improving seed purity, it is expected to increase grain production by 250 million kilograms, cotton by 20 million piculs, and peanuts by 30 million piculs.

Third, the force of capital investment. This year, a significant effort will be made to allocate 1.2 billion yuan in investment, an increase of 30% from last year. Additionally, 100 million US dollars will be allocated for the import of agricultural materials. Furthermore, by mobilizing the enthusiasm of farmers, agricultural capital and labor investments can reach over 2 billion yuan.

Fourth, the force of industry. Currently, industry has the power to equip and support agriculture more than ever before. It is necessary to establish close economic cooperation and collaboration with farmers.

Fifth, the force of circulation. The market mechanism can activate and stimulate the internal vitality of agriculture. Shandong has many good experiences in this regard.

Sixth, the internal force. By adjusting the structure of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, fishery, and grain, cotton, and oil production, a tremendous force can be generated.

Seventh, the force of leadership. Whether the party committees and governments at all levels truly prioritize agriculture and strengthen leadership is key.

　　姜春云谈确保山东农业再上新台阶    
    实行倾斜政策　调动七种力量
    本报讯  记者费伟伟报道：春节前夕，中共山东省委书记姜春云在接受记者采访时提出，农业要上新的台阶，关键要打破小农经济的狭隘眼界，从经济发展的全局和发展战略上来重新认识农业的基础地位。目前山东的农业远远不能适应国民经济发展和人民生活改善的需要，已到了非强化不可、非上新台阶不可的时候了，需要七种力量一齐调动。
    一是改革和政策的力量。从山东来看，要完善“双层经营”体系，解决一家一户解决不了的问题，为兴修水利、推广良种和新技术，认真做好产前产后的服务。
    二是科技的力量。科学技术是生产力。今年山东要推广１１项新技术，仅提高种子纯度一项，可望增产粮食２５亿公斤、皮棉２００万担、花生３００万担。
    三是资金投入的力量。今年下大决心安排１２亿元的投入，比上年增加３０％。再拿出１亿美元，用于农资进口。再一个是调动农民积极性，农业资金、劳务投入可达２０多亿元。
    四是工业的力量。现在工业比任何时候都有力量装备农业、支援农业，要同农民建立密切的经济协作与联合。
    五是流通的力量。市场机制可以启动、激发农业内部活力，这方面山东有许多好经验。
    六是内在的力量。把农林牧副渔和粮棉油的结构调整好，会产生巨大力量。
    七是领导的力量。各级党委、政府是否真正把农业摆到突出位置上，是否切实加强领导是关键所在。
