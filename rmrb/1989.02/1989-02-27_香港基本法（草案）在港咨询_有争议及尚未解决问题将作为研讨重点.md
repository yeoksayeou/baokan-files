The consultation on the Draft Basic Law of Hong Kong will begin in Hong Kong. Controversial and unresolved issues will be the focus of the discussion.

The Hong Kong Basic Law Consultative Committee Secretary-General Leung Chun-ying announced at a press conference today that the committee's secretariat will start distributing the Draft Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and related reference materials to the public from February 27.

This is the second step taken by the committee for the consultation on the Basic Law in Hong Kong.

The "Draft Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China" was published by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on February 21. The draft and related documents will be widely circulated for public opinion from the date of publication until the end of July 1989. After further amendments, they will be submitted to the Third Session of the Seventh National People's Congress in 1990 for deliberation.

To ensure that the consultation work on the Draft Basic Law proceeds smoothly in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Basic Law Consultative Committee has recently formulated five principles for the consultation work: comprehensive promotion, focused consultation; proactive and positive attitude, striving for effectiveness; learning from past experiences while considering the characteristics and nature of this consultation, emphasizing exchange and advocacy with the drafting committee; emphasizing the combination of consultation and negotiation. The committee decided to focus on some controversial and unresolved issues as the key points for discussion and collecting opinions.

The committee also decided that the secretariat will further formulate a specific consultation work plan and prepare to send a delegation to Beijing in mid-March to discuss with the drafting committee how to coordinate and do a good job in the second round of consultation.

　　香港基本法（草案）在港咨询
    有争议及尚未解决问题将作为研讨重点
    新华社香港二月二十六日电  （记者姚达添）香港基本法咨询委员会秘书长梁振英今天在这里举行的记者招待会上宣布，咨委会秘书处将从二十七日开始向全港市民广泛分发香港基本法（草案）小册子和有关参考资料。
    这是咨委会就基本法第二次咨询工作在香港采取的一个步骤。
    《中华人民共和国香港特别行政区基本法（草案）》已于本月二十一日由全国人大常委会公布。基本法（草案）及有关文件自公布之日起至一九八九年七月底，在香港和全国其他地区广泛征求意见，并作进一步修改后，将提请一九九○年举行的七届全国人大三次会议审议。
    为确保基本法（草案）咨询工作在香港顺利进行，香港基本法咨委会已于日前制定了咨询工作的五项原则：全面推广、重点咨询；采取主动积极的态度，争取工作有实效；参考过去的经验，但同时兼顾本次咨询的特点和性质着重与草委交流、游说工作；着重把咨询和协商相结合。咨委会决定把一些有争议及尚未得到解决的问题作为研讨和征集意见的重点。
    咨委会还决定，咨委会秘书处将进一步制定出具体的咨询工作计划，并准备于三月中旬派团到北京与起草委员会共同商议如何相互配合，做好第二次咨询工作。
