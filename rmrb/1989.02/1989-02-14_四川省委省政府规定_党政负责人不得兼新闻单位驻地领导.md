The Sichuan Provincial Party Committee Office and the Provincial Government Office recently issued a joint notice stating that party and government officials should not concurrently hold positions such as station chief of news unit local stations.

The notice points out that in recent years, some news units (including some periodicals) have established correspondent stations, offices, liaison stations, and communication stations in various places in Sichuan. Some party and government officials have concurrently held positions as chiefs or deputy chiefs, directors or deputy directors of these stations. These leading comrades already have very heavy workloads and should not concurrently hold leadership positions in news unit local stations.

The notice stipulates that party and government officials at the provincial level and at the city, prefecture, district, and county (district) levels should not concurrently hold leadership positions in subordinate organizations of news units (including periodical publishing houses). Those who have already concurrently held such positions should immediately resign from their concurrent positions.

In the future, the establishment of new correspondent stations and similar units in various places must strictly follow the relevant regulations of the central government and the province.

　　四川省委省政府规定    
    党政负责人不得兼新闻单位驻地领导
    本报讯  记者罗茂城报道：最近，中共四川省委办公厅、省政府办公厅联合发出通知：党政部门负责同志不得兼任新闻单位驻地记者站站长之类职务。
    通知指出，近年来，一些新闻单位（包括个别期刊）在四川各地设立了记者站、办事处、联络站、通联站，有些党政部门的负责同志兼任了这些站的站长或副站长，主任或副主任。这些领导同志本身的工作已相当繁重，不宜兼任新闻单位驻地领导职务。
    通知规定，省级各部门以及市、地、州、县（区）级各部门党政负责同志均不得兼任新闻单位（包括期刊社）下设机构的领导职务。已兼任上述职务的需立即辞去所兼任的职务。
    今后各地新建记者站等，都要按照中央和省上的有关规定从严掌握。
