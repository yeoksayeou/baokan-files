In a time when housing prices are soaring in various regions, leaving many residents sighing in despair, the Tianjin municipal government will launch 500,000 square meters of low-priced commercial housing this year. The goal is to make housing affordable and accessible to the general public, with an aim to complete all construction by National Day.

Over 400,000 square meters have already been "purchased" by more than ten departments.

Tianjin will implement several measures to sell commercial housing at lower prices, including:

- Joint construction and government assistance. Individuals contribute a portion (construction costs, major share), enterprises contribute a portion (small-scale municipal infrastructure, middle share), and the government supplements a portion (large-scale municipal infrastructure, minor share).

- Mobilizing citizens to participate in voluntary labor.

- All construction labor and material supply departments will, with the spirit of contributing to households with housing difficulties, adhere to the principle of cost recovery with minimal profit.

　　民建公助　众人举柴
    天津建低价商品房
    本报天津２月１８日电  记者肖荻报道：在各地商品房价格居高不下，居民望房兴叹声中，天津市政府今年将推出５０万平方米低价商品房，让广大群众愿意买、买得起，并力争国庆前全部竣工。４０多万平方米已被十几个局捷足先“购”。
    天津市将采取若干措施，低价出售商品房，其中包括：
    ——民建公助、合作建房。个人掏点（土建造价费，大头），企业拿点（小市政配套，中头），政府补点（大市政配套，小头）。
    ——发动市民义务劳动。
    ——所有施工劳务、材料供应各有关方面，以为住房困难户作贡献的精神，取酬以保本微利为原则。
