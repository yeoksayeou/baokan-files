Iran has taken countermeasures by recalling its ambassadors to the 12 member states of the European Economic Community (EEC).

The New China News Agency reported from Tehran on February 21 that the Iranian Foreign Ministry issued a statement on the 21st in response to the decision made by the EEC on the 20th, announcing that Iran will also recall its ambassadors to the 12 member states of the EEC.

The foreign ministers of the 12 EEC member states decided on the 20th in Brussels to recall their ambassadors from Iran to protest Iran's threat to kill the author of "The Satanic Verses," Salman Rushdie.

The statement said that the order by Iran's religious leader Khomeini to punish the British writer Rushdie, who blasphemed Islam, is "the unanimous opinion of Muslim leaders worldwide."

The statement criticized the EEC for refusing to condemn "The Satanic Verses," which insults Islam.
