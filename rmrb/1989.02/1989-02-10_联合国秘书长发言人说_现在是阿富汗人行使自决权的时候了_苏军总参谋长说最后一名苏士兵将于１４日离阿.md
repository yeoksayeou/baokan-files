	The spokesperson for the UN Secretary-General said that the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan is nearing completion, and it is now time for the Afghan people to exercise their right to self-determination.

	Juliani made these remarks after a meeting between Secretary-General Perez de Cuellar and his personal representative for supervising the implementation of the Geneva Agreements on Afghanistan, Cordovez. The Soviet troops are scheduled to complete their withdrawal from Afghanistan by February 15.

	Juliani said that Perez de Cuellar and Cordovez discussed the situation in Afghanistan, with a particular focus on the withdrawal of Soviet troops.

	The first deputy minister of the Soviet Defense Ministry and Chief of the General Staff, Moiseyev, stated that the last Soviet soldier will leave Afghanistan on February 14.

	Earlier, some Soviet officials had mentioned that the Soviet Union would complete its withdrawal from Afghanistan a few days ahead of schedule. Moiseyev refuted this claim today.

	He told a Tass reporter, "The situation in Afghanistan remains complex," and urged the United States and Pakistan to also fulfill their obligations under the Geneva Agreements.

	Tass reported that a Soviet motorized unit had crossed the Afghan-Soviet border on February 8 and arrived in the Kushka region of the Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic.
