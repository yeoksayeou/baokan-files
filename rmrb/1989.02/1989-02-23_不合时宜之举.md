Inopportune Actions

Zhang Dezhen

It is reported that in the U.S. defense budget for 1990, there will be a significant increase in expenditures for chemical weapons. This includes allocating a large sum of money to develop and produce new-generation chemical weapons, such as the so-called "Giant Eye" binary poison gas bombs and various types of chemical weapons that can "penetrate gas masks," and so on. In the current situation where the international situation is gradually easing, this action by the U.S. is obviously inopportune.

People know that chemical weapons are a barbaric weapon of mass destruction. Since their inception, they have been repeatedly condemned. As early as 1925, relevant countries signed the Geneva Protocol on the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or Other Gases, and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare. After the advent of nuclear weapons, people's attention was more focused on the enormous harm that nuclear weapons pose to humanity, but they never relaxed their vigilance against chemical warfare and chemical weapons. In recent years, the call to ban the production and use of chemical weapons has been growing louder. At the beginning of last month, the international conference on the prohibition of chemical weapons held in Paris, attended by 149 countries, reflected the serious concern of the international community on this issue. The "Final Declaration" adopted at the conference, in addition to reaffirming the validity of the 1925 Geneva Protocol, also specifically called for the early conclusion of an international convention to comprehensively prohibit the development, production, stockpiling, and use of chemical weapons. The U.S., as a participating country in the conference, has made solemn commitments to the conference declaration. People had hoped that the superpower with the most chemical weapons and which could do much in banning chemical weapons would take the lead in taking action and contribute to the signing of the convention. However, it is puzzling that the U.S. is allocating budget to manufacture such weapons while endorsing the ban on chemical weapons at the conference. This is clearly a case of saying one thing and doing another. This will undoubtedly create obstacles for the negotiations on a comprehensive and thorough ban on chemical weapons. No wonder a U.S. congressman asked, "Are we leading the world in the direction of controlling chemical weapons, or in the direction of spreading chemical weapons?"

People still remember that just two months ago, the U.S. government, on the pretext that a Libyan factory was "producing poison gas," launched a large-scale military operation, threatening to "take military action" to destroy the factory. For a time, this caused a great stir internationally. This cannot but make one feel that the U.S. is applying a "double standard" on the issue of chemical weapons: it is natural for the U.S. to produce chemical weapons; if others do so, it is a grave offense that must be severely condemned.

Why does the U.S. still insist on developing chemical weapons today? According to military officials, it is to "prevent a Soviet nerve gas attack in Europe." In other words, it is a forced measure. This is an old tune in the arms race. If this continues, the result can only be the re-escalation of the arms race. It seems that due to the long-term military confrontation between superpowers and the deeply rooted group consciousness, mutual suspicion and lack of trust are indeed difficult to eliminate for the time being.

### 不合时宜之举

　　不合时宜之举
    张德真
    据悉，美国１９９０年度国防预算中，将大幅度增加化学武器的费用。其中包括增拨巨款用来研制和生产新一代化学武器，如什么“巨眼”式二元毒气炸弹、各种能“穿透防毒面具”的新式化学武器，等等。在当前国际局势逐步趋向缓和的情况下，美国这一行动显然不合时宜。
    人们知道，化学武器是一种野蛮的大规模毁灭性武器，自问世以来，屡遭谴责。早在１９２５年有关国家就签订了一项关于禁止在战争中使用化学和细菌武器的日内瓦议定书。核武器出现后，人们的注意力虽然更多地转向核武器对人类的巨大危害性，但一刻也没有放松对化学战和化学武器的警惕。近些年来，要求禁止生产和使用化学武器的呼声更是不断高涨。上月初在巴黎召开的有１４９个国家参加的禁止化学武器国际大会，集中地反映了国际社会对这个问题的严重关切。这次会议通过的《最后宣言》除了重申１９２５年日内瓦议定书的有效性之外，还特别呼吁尽快缔结一项全面禁止发展、生产、储存和使用化学武器的国际公约。美国作为会议的参加国，对会议宣言自是作了庄严承诺的。人们本来希望拥有最多化学武器、在禁止化学武器上可以大有作为的超级大国能率先采取行动，为推动公约的签订作出贡献。然而，令人迷惑不解的是，美国一面在会上举手赞成禁止化学武器，一面却又增拨预算制造此种武器，这岂非言行不一？这样做无疑会给缔结一项全面彻底禁止化学武器公约的谈判制造障碍。难怪美国一位国会议员责问：“我们是引导世界朝控制化学武器方向努力，还是朝扩散化学武器的方向努力？”
    人们还记得，就在两个月前，美国政府以所谓利比亚工厂“生产毒气”为由，大兴问罪之师，扬言要“采取军事行动”摧毁这座工厂。一时间，闹得国际上沸沸扬扬。这不能不使人感到，在化学武器问题上，美国实行的是“双重标准”：自己生产化学武器理所当然；如果别人这么干就是大逆不道，要大加挞伐。
    时至今日，美国为什么还要大力发展化学武器呢？据军方人士说是为了“阻止苏联在欧洲发动神经毒气的进攻”。换言之，是被迫而为之。这完全是军备竞赛中的一种老调，如果这样下去，其结果只能是军备竞赛的重新升级。看来，由于超级大国长期的军事对抗和根深蒂固的集团意识，互相猜忌，互不信任一时确实难以消除。
