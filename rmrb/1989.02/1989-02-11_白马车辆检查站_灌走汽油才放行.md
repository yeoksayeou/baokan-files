On December 3rd of last year, two trucks from our unit were transporting rice to the Ningxia Military Farm. While passing through the White Horse checkpoint in the section from Wuzhong City, Gansu Province, to Zhongning County, we stopped for inspection. All our documents were in order, but the three inspectors delayed our departure, claiming there was a problem with our paperwork. When we asked what the problem was, they refused to specify. Later, one of them siphoned twenty kilograms of gasoline from our vehicles before allowing us to proceed.

　　白马车辆检查站  灌走汽油才放行
    去年十二月三日，我部两辆汽车去宁夏军区农场运大米，途经甘肃吴忠市到中宁县区段的白马镇检查站时，停车接受检查。我们各种手续完备，检查站的三人却拖延时间不放行，说手续有问题。我们问有什么问题？他们又不说。后来，他们中的一人从车上灌走了二十公斤汽油后，才让我们将车开走。
