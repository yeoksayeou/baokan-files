The Energy Department has called on local authorities to take effective measures to ensure a stable power supply during the upcoming Spring Festival, allowing the public to welcome the Year of the Snake with joy.

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency in Beijing on January 31, an official from the Energy Department urged: With the Spring Festival approaching, all regions must take effective measures to ensure power supply for residents during the festival, allowing people to welcome the Year of the Snake with joy.

Due to the fact that power plants in the fourth quarter of last year relied on stockpiles to meet and exceed production targets, while the transportation plan for coal used in power generation was not completed well, resulting in severe shortages of coal reserves in various regions. Therefore, in January of this year, except for Shandong, Sichuan, and the Northwest regions, the power generation in other regions showed a downward trend. It is expected that the power supply situation will become even more tense during the Spring Festival.

Lu Yanchang, Chief Engineer of the Energy Department's Power Bureau, and Liu Zhenpeng, Director of the Power Dispatch Bureau, believe that under these circumstances, it is even more necessary to strictly implement planned power usage. They pointed out that electricity cannot be stored and can only be generated and used as needed. In the current situation of insufficient power generation, each region should formulate a detailed power usage plan. This plan should prioritize ensuring power supply for municipal and residential use during the Spring Festival, and if necessary, reduce industrial power usage. To ensure the normal operation of the power grid, they emphasized the need to strengthen the implementation of power usage plans and corresponding supervision. Those who disrupt the power usage plan should be penalized.

At the same time, it is required that the power sector should manage the equipment well, and local governments should not interfere with power grid dispatching to ensure the safe operation of the power grid.

　　能源部要求各地确保节日用电
    据新华社北京１月３１日电  （记者赵明亮）能源部有关负责人呼吁：目前春节临近，各地务必采取有效措施，确保节日居民用电，让群众欢欢喜喜迎接蛇年。
    由于去年第四季度各电厂靠吃库存满发、超发，而发电用煤的运输计划又完成得不好，造成各地电煤库存严重不足。因此，今年１月份，除山东、四川和西北地区外，其他地区的发电量均出现下降趋势。预计春节期间，电力供应紧张局面将进一步加剧。
    能源部电力总工程师陆延昌和电力调度局局长刘振鹏认为：在这种情况下，更有必要严格实行计划用电。他们指出，电是不能储存的，只能发多少用多少。在当前发电量不足的情况下，各地应该制订周密的用电计划。其中要全力保证春节市政和人民生活用电，必要时下决心压一点工业用电。为了保证电网的正常运行，他们强调要加强用电计划的严肃性，并实行相应的监督，对冲击用电计划者应予以制裁。
    同时，要求电业部门要管好设备，各地政府不要干预电网调度，确保电网安全运行。
