The People's Liberation Army Press has published "Chronicle of Major Events in the History of the Kuomintang" (compiled by Li Songlin, Qi Fulin, Xu Xiaojun, and Zhang Guilan). The book adopts a chronological format to succinctly and comprehensively, yet objectively, narrate the history of the Kuomintang. The book is compiled based on various newspaper and journal materials, as well as research findings from previous and current scholars, covering major events in the Kuomintang's political, economic, military, and diplomatic aspects.

Researching the history of the Kuomintang is still in its early stages on the mainland. This book undoubtedly provides valuable historical materials for mainland scholars' research work. The chronicle records events from 1894 to 1986. The rise of the Chinese bourgeois democratic revolution marked the beginning of the Kuomintang's origins. The revolutionary organization led by Sun Yat-sen, after numerous twists and turns, finally overthrew the imperial system, established the Republic, and achieved victory in the Xinhai Revolution, leaving a thrilling page in the history of China's old democratic revolution. In 1912, the Kuomintang was officially formed. It went through stages such as the failed struggle against Yuan Shikai, the reorganization of the Kuomintang, and the implementation of the New Three Principles of the People. However, after Sun Yat-sen's death, Chiang Kai-shek betrayed Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary Three Principles of the People and implemented the policy of "cleansing and splitting" (i.e., purging communists). From then on, the Kuomintang completely betrayed the revolution. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan, under the pressure of the entire nation, Chiang Kai-shek was forced to take the path of uniting to resist Japan, achieving the second cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and contributing to the Chinese nation and the world's anti-fascist war. However, within the anti-Japanese national united front, he openly pursued a policy of resisting Japan on one hand and opposing communists on the other, continuing his anti-communist stance. After Japan's surrender, in 1949, Chiang Kai-shek retired and later led the remnants to Taiwan, where he established the Kuomintang Reform Committee in August 1950, thus entering the period of ruling Taiwan. The book historically showcases the nearly 90-year process and turning points of the Kuomintang.

"Chronicle of Major Events in the History of the Kuomintang" is the first book on the history of the Kuomintang published on the mainland. Although it is not yet perfect in terms of format, content selection, and narration, the attempt made is beneficial.

　　《中国国民党大事记》介绍
    武凡　戴雪梅
    解放军出版社出版的《中国国民党大事记》（李松林、齐福麟、许小军、张桂兰编写），采用历史编年体的形式，简要而又全面、客观地记叙了中国国民党的历史。全书是根据各种报刊材料以及前人和当前学术界研究成果编写而成，广涉国民党政治、经济、军事、外交等各方面的大事。
    研究中国国民党史，在大陆尚属开拓阶段，本书无疑为大陆学者的研究工作提供了具有史学价值的历史资料。《事记》所记载的史料起于１８９４年，止于１９８６年。中国资产阶级民主革命的兴起，是中国国民党起源的开端。孙中山领导的资产阶级革命团体，经过数十次的曲折斗争，终于推翻了帝制，建立了民国，取得了辛亥革命的胜利，在中国旧民主主义革命史上留下了令人振奋的一页。１９１２年国民党宣告组成，历经了反袁斗争的失败，国民党的改组及新三民主义的实施等阶段。然而，孙中山逝世后，蒋介石违背了孙中山的革命三民主义，实行“清党分共”政策。自此，中国国民党完全背叛革命。抗日战争爆发后，蒋介石在全国人民的压力下，不得不走上了团结抗日道路，实现了国共两党的第二次合作，为中华民族和世界反法西斯战争作出了贡献。但是，在抗日民族统一战线中，他又公然奉行一面抗日，一面反共的政策，继续坚持反共立场。日本帝国主义投降后，１９４９年蒋介石引退，后率领残部撤到台湾，于１９５０年８月成立了国民党改造委员会，从此进入了台湾统治时期，全书对中国国民党９０余年的进程和转折都作了历史的展示。
    《中国国民党大事记》是目前大陆出版的第一部中国国民党史书，在体例编排和内容取舍、记述等方面虽然还不尽完善，但所作的尝试是有益的。
