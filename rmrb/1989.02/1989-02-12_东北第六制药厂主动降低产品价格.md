In a situation where chemical raw materials are in short supply nationwide and prices remain high, the Northeast Sixth Pharmaceutical Factory has chosen not to take advantage of the market conditions. Instead, it has proactively reduced prices and passed on the benefits to consumers. At the end of last year, the factory reduced the price of its main product, fluphepacine, by 10 percent, achieving good social benefits.

Fluphepacine is renowned as a "globally popular fully synthetic antibiotic" and is highly effective against gastrointestinal and urinary system diseases. It is a sought-after product in the medical market. As one of the main producers of fluphepacine in China, the Northeast Sixth Pharmaceutical Factory announced at the national procurement meeting in November last year that it would offer a price 10 percent lower than the state-regulated price, despite the prevailing trend of price increases.

    东北第六制药厂主动降低产品价格
  　在全国化工原料紧缺、价格居高不降的情况下，东北第六制药厂货俏不居奇，主动降价让利，去年底将主要产品氟哌酸降价百分之十，取得了良好社会效益。
    氟哌酸被誉为“风靡全世界的全合成抗生素”，对胃肠、泌尿系统疾病有显著疗效，是医药市场上的俏货。我国氟哌酸主要生产厂家之一的东北第六制药厂却在去年十一月举行的全国订货会上，顶着一派涨价声，推出了低于国家规定价格百分之十的牌价。
