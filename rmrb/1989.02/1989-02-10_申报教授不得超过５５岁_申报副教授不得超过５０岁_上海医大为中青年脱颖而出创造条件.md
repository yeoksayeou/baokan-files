Shanghai Medical University has promoted 12 professors and 8 associate professors out of turn, creating opportunities for talented mid-career professionals to excel.

Shanghai Medical University, with a 60-year history, is a key university. In the past, due to the influence of seniority, young people found it difficult to be promoted. The newly appointed president, Tang Zhaoyou, believes that Shanghai Medical University still has some advantages, but its future prospects are not promising. If talent cultivation is not emphasized, these advantages will be lost. This year, in January, President Tang's first task was to promote outstanding mid-career teachers out of turn. The school introduced a competitive mechanism into the promotion process, adopting a "challenge" format for selection, giving outstanding mid-career teachers the opportunity to shine.

This promotion has set age limits: applicants for professor positions must not exceed 55 years old, and applicants for associate professor positions must not exceed 50 years old. Additionally, regardless of their educational background, seniority, or original position, they can all apply. The entire school has 20 promotion opportunities, and 122 people signed up. Based on the "challenge" at the department and affiliated hospital levels, 30 outstanding individuals were selected, and then a school-wide "challenge" was held. They each took the stage, presenting their work achievements and academic levels, and answering questions, followed by scoring by the committee. The High-Level Position Evaluation Committee of the school evaluated their moral character, medical skills, and teaching abilities, and finally conducted an anonymous vote.

Among the professors promoted out of turn this time, many were promoted to associate professors just two years ago and, according to regulations, could only be promoted after five more years. Some were promoted directly from lecturers to professors. Shao Mingchuan, a 47-year-old lecturer from the Basic Medical Department, conducted pioneering systematic research on the "regulation of glycoprotein processing," which is currently at the world's leading level. He was promoted directly to professor.

　　申报教授不得超过５５岁　申报副教授不得超过５０岁
　  上海医大为中青年脱颖而出创造条件
    据新华社上海２月９日电  （记者马雪松）上海医科大学破格提拔１２名教授和８名副教授，为具有真才实学的中青年脱颖而出创造条件。
    上海医科大学是一所有６０年历史的重点大学，过去由于受论资排辈的影响，年轻人很难得以提拔。新任校长汤钊猷认为，上海医大的老本还可以吃一阵，但后劲不足。如果不注意人才的培养，优势势必丧失。今年１月，汤校长抓的第一件事就是破格提拔优秀中青年教师。学校把竞争机制引进晋升工作中，采取“打擂台”形式进行选拔，让优秀中青年教师有机会崭露头角。
    这次晋升规定了年龄限制，申报教授的不得超过５５岁，申报副教授的不得超过５０岁，此外不论其学历、资历以及原职务高低都可以申报。全校共有２０个晋升名额，报名的竟有１２２人。在各系、附属医院基层“打擂台”的基础上，选拔出３０名佼佼者，再在全校“打擂台”。他们一个个走上讲台，讲自己的工作成绩、学术水平，并回答提问，然后由评委打分。学校高级职务评审委员会对他们的思想品德、医疗水平、教书育人情况进行评议，最后无记名投票。
    这次破格选拔出的教授，不少是两年前才晋升为副教授的，按规定，他们５年后才能晋升，还有的是从讲师破格晋升为教授。基础医学部讲师、４７岁的邵明川，对“糖蛋白加工的调控”作了开创性的系统研究，这项成果目前处于世界领先水平，他被越级晋升为教授。
