When I arrived in Pingyao and stepped out of the station, it felt as if history had reverted a thousand years. An ancient city stood proudly on the land of Jinzhong, its walls winding and the shadows of battlements overlapping.

Some people call Pingyao an "unparalleled city of cultural relics." The clear waters of the Fen River flow past the western side of the city, whispering tales of the city's vicissitudes. Legend has it that in ancient times, this place was the fiefdom of Emperor Yao. 2,700 years ago, during the reign of King Xuan of Zhou, a city was built here. The Qin Dynasty established a county here, initially named Pingtao, and during the Northern Wei Dynasty, it was renamed Pingyao, more than 1,400 years ago. Pingyao is not particularly prominent in history. It has neither the glory of being an imperial capital nor the legendary tales of battles. Perhaps it is precisely because of its ordinariness and lack of contention with the world that it has been preserved so well for future generations to see this ancient city.

Standing on the city wall, running your hands over the large bricks, you are also touching the history of Pingyao. The existing city wall is what remains after the expansion during the third year of the Hongwu reign of the Ming Dynasty. The wall is 6 to 10 meters high, 3 to 6 meters wide at the top, and 6,157 meters in circumference. It has withstood 600 years of wind and rain and remains intact, a rare sight in the country. The battlements on the wall are continuous, with lookout holes and arrow slits on top, and storage for weapons, grain, and rest areas for soldiers below. Strolling through the streets, you will truly experience the "ancient charm." The shops on both sides of the street have wooden carvings and colorful paintings; inside, there are antique counters and old-style shelves. If it weren't for the people wearing modern clothing and the sound of popular music in the streets, you would truly be lost in the times of Qin and Han, or Wei and Jin. During the Ming and Qing Dynasties, Pingyao was famous for its bustling commerce in the three Jin regions, with the saying "Pingyao City, never full, never empty." There are also many banks and remittance shops in the city. The first remittance shop in China, "Rishengchang," had branches all over the country and its business reached overseas, earning the reputation of "connecting the world."

A folk song, "Nanluwan," sings of the artist Guo Lanying, who pours her deep affection for her hometown into the sweet melody: "Pingyao beef, Taigu pancakes..." Pingyao beef is a famous historical product of the three Jin regions, with excellent color, aroma, and taste, and can be called "ancient fragrance." There is also "Pingyao polished lacquerware," with gold inlay and carved patterns, shining with brilliance. It was famous as early as the Tang Dynasty, which is truly "ancient color."

As a historical and cultural city, Pingyao can boast of its antiquity. There are more than 70 cultural relics and ancient sites within the county, such as the Wen Temple inside the city, and the Zhenguo Temple, Cixiang Temple, and Baiyun Temple outside the city. The most famous is the Shuanglin Temple, built during the Northern Qi Dynasty, with three courtyards and ten halls. Each hall is adorned with colorful sculptures and hanging sculptures, with lifelike shapes and mature techniques. The largest is over a meter tall, and the smallest is less than a foot, totaling more than 2,000 statues. The eighteen Luohan statues are recognized as extremely valuable artistic treasures.

Pingyao Ancient City is also a blessed location for film and television shooting. In recent years, more than ten films and television shows, such as "Secret Order Interception," "White-Haired Girl," "New Star," and "The Last Emperor," have been filmed here. As a tourist destination, people can come here to reminisce about the past, but facing the iron-walled city and narrow alleys, will it evoke historical reflections in you? Take a walk outside the city! Look at the newly built factories, the brand-new buildings, the surging traffic, row after row, rising, expanding, widening... Today's Pingyao is breaking free from confinement and seclusion!

### 古色古香平遥城

　　古色古香平遥城
    沈琨
    当我来到平遥，走出车站时，仿佛觉得历史回溯了千年。一座古城雄峙晋中大地，城垣逶迤，堞影重重。
    有人把平遥称作不可多得的“文物城”。清澈的汾河从城西而过，潺潺诉说古城的沧桑：相传远古时，此处是帝尧的封地。２７００年前的周宣王时，这里已建起城池。秦在此置县，初名平陶，北魏改名平遥，距今也有１４００多年。平遥在历史上并不煊赫，它既没有过帝都霸业的殊荣，也不曾留下泣雨惊风的战绩，也许正唯其平常，与世无争，才得以为今人完好地留下了这座年代遥远的城池。
    登上城头，抚着那大块的墙砖，你便也抚着了平遥的历史。现存城墙是明洪武三年扩建后留下的。墙高６至１０米，顶宽３至６米，周长６１５７米。它历经６００余载风雨，至今完好无缺，这在全国是罕见的一例。城头堞楼连亘，楼上设瞭望孔、箭孔，楼下是存放军械、粮草和供士兵们休憩之地。徜徉街头，你更会体味出所谓的“古色古香”。街道两旁，铺板门的商店木雕装饰，油漆彩绘；店内古式柜面，老式货架……若不是人们穿着现代服装，街上响着流行的音乐，真令你不知秦汉，无论魏晋了。明清时，平遥即以繁华的商业蜚声三晋，有“填不满、拉不完的平遥城”之说。城内还有不少专营钱钞汇兑的钱庄、票号，我国第一家票号“日升昌”，分庄遍及全国，业务远涉海外，有“汇通天下”的声誉。
    一曲清歌《南泥湾》，唱出了个艺术家郭兰英，她把对家乡的一片深情，也融进那甜美的歌声：“平遥的牛肉太谷的饼……”平遥牛肉是三晋的历史名产，色香味俱佳，可以称作是“古香”。还有“平遥推光漆器”，描金镂彩，卉耀英华，唐代早有盛名，这不又是地地道道的“古色”么？
    作为历史文化名城，平遥足可夸古。县境内有文物古迹７０余处，如城内的文庙，城外的镇国寺、慈相寺、白云寺，最有名的是始建于北齐的双林寺，院落三进，殿宇十座。各殿遍布彩塑、悬塑，造型生动，技法圆熟，大者丈余，小不盈尺，计有２０００余尊。十八罗汉等彩塑被公认是价值极高的艺术珍品。
    平遥古城，还是得天独厚的影视摄景地。近几年来，《密令截击》、《白求恩》、《新星》、《末代皇帝》等十余部电影、电视都曾来此取景拍摄。作为旅游胜地，人们尽可以到这里吊往怀古，但面对铁桶似的城墙，狭窄的街巷，是否会唤起你历史的反思？也到城外走一走吧！看看新建的厂房，崭新的楼群，如潮的车流，一座座、一排排、一行行，在崛起、在伸展、在拓宽……今天的平遥，正在走出禁锢和封闭！
