A few years ago, most farmers in Langfang, Hebei Province, did not recognize the supply and marketing cooperative as their own organization, saying, "The more money the supply and marketing cooperative makes, the farther it is from us." Now, however, more and more farmers are coming to the supply and marketing cooperative to "link up." In summarizing this change, the supply and marketing cooperative in this region concluded that it is necessary to fundamentally change the relationship between the supply and marketing cooperative and the farmers, truly combining their interests and prospering together.

Helping farmers produce according to market demand

In the transition from a product economy to a commodity economy, farmers' production often has a high degree of spontaneity and blindness. The supply and marketing cooperative, on the other hand, avoids transactions that are unprofitable or slightly risky. This is one of the main reasons for the "difficulty in buying and selling" that has emerged in recent years. Solving this problem requires guiding and organizing farmers to produce according to market demand. To address this issue, the regional supply and marketing cooperative, after surveying domestic and international markets, especially the demand in Beijing and Tianjin, proposed in 1987 to the entire system of cadres and staff the requirement to help farmers grow cotton, vegetables, fruits, edible fungi, and raise chickens, ducks, pigeons, fish, cattle, sheep, and rabbits. They took the following measures. First, assist county and township governments in establishing various production bases. For example, the Langfang City Supply and Marketing Cooperative, based on the local farmers' habit of cultivating edible fungi, provided spores, raw materials, technical training, and product sales services, supporting and developing 3,800 large-scale edible fungi producers. They have now initially established an edible fungi base with a total area of 240,000 square meters. In this way, the supply and marketing system in the entire region has developed and established more than 20 vegetable, fruit, and various breeding bases of different characteristics and scales. Second, mobilize cadres and staff to disseminate market information and provide technical services according to the needs of commodity base construction, cultivating various large-scale operators. Over the past year, the supply and marketing system in the entire region has dispatched more than 550 cadres and staff to directly support the development of 2,500 large-scale planting and breeding households. Third, on the basis of supporting and developing production, further strengthen circulation methods to ensure smooth flow of goods. The supply and marketing cooperative pays special attention to establishing stable production and sales relationships with the producers it supports, implementing contract production and sales. In the first half of 1988, 13,150 million kilograms of agricultural and sideline products were contracted for sale to farmers, with a total value of over 80 million yuan.

Due to the adoption of the above measures, the development of the region's planting and breeding industries, especially the breeding industry, has been promoted, and the commercialization of agriculture in the entire region has been accelerated. In 1988, the total income of the region's livestock industry reached 268.996 million yuan, an increase of 18.5% over 1987.

Providing capital for farmers and sharing profits

The supply and marketing cooperative must make money; otherwise, the enterprise will lose its means of survival and the original driving force to support farmers in developing production. However, as an organization of farmers, is it to make money from farmers or to help farmers make money together in the market? After a debate, the entire supply and marketing system in the region reached a consensus. Since 1988, the entire supply and marketing system in the region has clearly put forward the slogan of helping farmers develop production and helping farmers make money; when making money together with farmers, they are willing to let farmers take the lion's share and themselves take the smaller share. After Sanhe County was designated as a chicken production base, the county supply and marketing cooperative took the lead in operating 13 chicken farms and built supporting facilities such as storage, transportation, and processing. Except for the rearing link, which is left to the households, the supply and marketing cooperative took over the other links such as chick rearing, chick transportation, feed supply, epidemic prevention, and insurance, and purchase and processing. If calculated according to the labor input, the supply and marketing cooperative getting a little more is also reasonable. But they decided: in the profit of 2.4 yuan per chicken, they would only take the decimal part. Some staff said, "After working for a few months, we only get two chicken claws (4 jiao), it's too much of a loss." But the director of the county supply and marketing cooperative, Li Guishan, believed: "If we don't do this, we can't organize and mobilize the masses of farmers." The fact is indeed so. At the beginning of mobilizing farmers to raise chickens, there were very few sign-ups. But after the first batch of chicken farmers received the money, the farmers saw the sincerity of the supply and marketing cooperative and applied to raise chickens in droves. In a few months, the county's chicken breeding quantity surged from 9 million to 16 million, and more than 600 large-scale chicken farmers with more than 1,000 chickens each emerged. Due to the expansion of the production scale, the originally insignificant "two chicken claws" accumulated tens of millions of yuan in income for the supply and marketing cooperative. The staff of this supply and marketing cooperative all said, "As long as we help the farmers get rich, we will also get rich."

For a long time, in the fierce competition of commodity production, the supply and marketing cooperative and farmers were "sweeping their own doorsteps." Farmers, due to their small capital and weak strength, often suffered losses when facing risks. Since 1987, the supply and marketing cooperative has changed its previous practices and implemented three measures: first, advance production funds. In the first half of last year, Yongqing, Langfang, Sanhe, and Gu'an counties and cities jointly allocated over 30 million yuan in funds to support farmers in developing the breeding of pigeons, sheep, ducks, and chickens. Second, implement protection prices. Sanhe County Supply and Marketing Cooperative implemented protection prices for the supported meat chickens. Last year, in the first half of the year, the price of chicken feed purchased from outside the county increased three times, and some large-scale farmers were worried. The supply and marketing cooperative adjusted the purchase price of meat chickens three times, avoiding losses for the breeding farmers and stabilizing meat chicken production. Third, provide facilities. To solve the problems of farmers' difficulties in buying, selling, storing, and transporting, the supply and marketing cooperative has established 19 processing projects such as oil pressing and slaughtering in the past year, increased a batch of gas-regulated warehouses, cold storage, and transportation vehicles, and improved processing and storage capacity.

Returning profits to farmers and improving services

In the past, the profits from production belonged to the farmers, and the profits from operations belonged to the supply and marketing cooperative, which was considered a matter of course. As a result, the relationship between the supply and marketing cooperative and the farmers became a simple buying and selling relationship, and the interests of the two sides were often mutually exclusive. The buying side tried to lower the grade and price, and even refused to purchase; the selling side used inferior goods to pass off as good ones, adulterated, and even refused to deliver. To change this increasingly antagonistic buying and selling relationship with farmers, the supply and marketing cooperative system in Langfang region started to implement the method of returning profits to farmers for some agricultural products, especially those with large price fluctuations, from 1988. The fruit cooperative of Gu'an County's Zhiziying Supply and Marketing Cooperative returned all profits to the stockholding fruit farmers. When the farmers delivered fruits, the supply and marketing cooperative paid the price according to the contract in addition to returning 20% of the profits to the farmers. In addition, 10% was taken from the remaining 80% of the profits as dividends for the stockholding farmers, implementing interest-bearing dividends. The vast number of fruit farmers actively delivered more and better fruits to the cooperative, and the delivery volume increased by more than 7.5 million kilograms compared to last year. Due to the implementation of the 15% return method, the fruit cooperative of Yongqing County's Houyue Supply and Marketing Cooperative purchased 4 million kilograms more fruit products in 1988 than in 1987. For some products that are not convenient to implement profit returns, the method of taking part of the profits to build service facilities or purchase production materials is adopted, indirectly returning the benefits to the farmers.

Farmers hope that the supply and marketing cooperative can take over everything they produce and provide everything they need. How to meet this demand of the farmers? The practice of the Langfang region's supply and marketing cooperative is to establish a series of service systems around commodity production bases and bulk products.

Nanmeng Town in Ba County is a traditional watermelon production area with an annual output of over 25 million kilograms. Surrounding this base, the town's supply and marketing cooperative took measures such as packaging supply, technical guidance, transportation, and sales. They established information and sales points in Beijing and Tianjin, responsible for providing market information, signing contracts, and promoting products. Farmers regard the supply and marketing cooperative as their own "god of wealth."

To further improve services, the supply and marketing cooperative took the lead in establishing many professional service organizations.

According to statistics, since this year, 47 professional service organizations such as chicken breeding associations, vegetable service companies, fruit cooperatives, and edible fungus research institutes have been established in various places. These service organizations, with the supply and marketing cooperative as the backbone, link several large-scale production and operation households, and operate according to the principles of voluntary mutual benefit, democratic management, and autonomous operation. Internally, they take service as their purpose, and externally, they operate in an enterprise-like manner. After leaving a certain proportion for accumulation, the remaining profits are all distributed according to the quantity of products delivered.

　　与农民同兴共荣
    ——廊坊地区供销社系统改革调查
    梁班
    前几年，河北省廊坊地区多数农民还不承认供销社是自己的组织，说“供销社钱赚得越多，离我们越远。”现在却有越来越多的农民找上门同供销社“挂钩”。这个地区的供销社在总结这一变化过程时得出的一个重要结论是，必须从根本上改变供销社与农民的关系，把自己和农民的利益真正地结合在一起，同兴共荣。
    　　　　帮助农民按照市场需要生产
    在由产品经济向商品经济转变的过程中，农民的生产常常带有很大的自发性和盲目性，而供销社对于无利可图或稍有风险的买卖，则根本不敢涉足。这是近几年来出现的“买难、卖难”问题的一个重要原因。解决这个问题，就要引导和组织农民按照市场需要发展生产。为了解决这个问题，地区供销社在调查了国内外市场，特别是京、津市场需求的基础上，于１９８７年向全系统干部职工提出了帮助农民种棉花、瓜菜、水果、食用菌，养鸡、鸭、鸽、鱼、牛、羊、兔的要求。他们相继采取了措施。一、协助县、乡政府建立不同的生产基地。如廊坊市供销社根据当地农民有培养食用菌的习惯，通过提供菌种、原料，举办技术培训和推销产品等项服务，扶持、发展食用菌大户３８００个，现已初步建成总面积达２４万平方米的食用菌基地。这样，供销系统在全区已发展建立起各具特色、规模不等的瓜菜、水果及各种养殖基地２０多个。二、发动干部、职工按照商品基地建设的需要深入到村、到户传播市场信息，进行技术服务，培养各种经营大户。一年多来，全区供销社系统抽调了５５０多名干部职工直接扶持起了种植、养殖大户２５００多个。三、在扶持和发展生产的基础上，进一步强化流通手段，做到货畅其流。供销社特别注意与接受扶持的生产者建立稳固的产销关系，实行包产、包销。１９８８年上半年，与农民签订了１３１５０万公斤的农副产品销售合同，总值达８０００多万元。
    由于采取了以上措施，带动和促进了全区种养业特别是养殖业的发展，１９８８年全区畜牧业总收入达２６８９９．６万元，比１９８７年增加１８．５％，加快了全区农业商品化的进程。
    　　　　为农民出本钱　利益共享
    供销社必须赚钱，否则企业就丧失了生存之本和扶持农民发展生产的原动力。然而，作为农民自己的组织，是光赚农民的钱，还是帮助农民一起到市场上去赚钱呢？全区供销系统经过一番争论，统一了认识。１９８８年以来，全区供销系统明确地把帮助农民发展生产、帮助农民赚钱作为自己的口号；在同农民一起赚钱时，心甘情愿地让农民拿大头，自己得小头。三河县被确定为肉鸡生产基地后，县供销社以自办１３个养鸡场为龙头，并增建了储运、加工等设施，扶持大户发展养鸡。除了饲养这个环节放在户以外，育雏、运雏、供送饲料、防疫保险、收购加工等其它环节都由供销社包了起来。如按付出的劳动量算，供销社多得一点，也是无可非议的。但他们决定：在每只鸡两块四毛钱的盈利中，只要个零头。有些职工说“折腾了几个月，只落两个鸡爪子（四毛钱），太亏了。”但县供销社主任李贵山同志认为：“不这样，就不能把广大农民组织和发动起来。”事实正是如此。开始发动农民养鸡时，报名者寥寥无几。但当第一批养鸡户把钱拿到手后，农民看到了供销社的真心实意，纷纷申请养鸡，几个月时间，全县肉鸡饲养量由９０万只猛增到１６０万只，并出现了养鸡千只以上的大户６００多个。由于生产规模扩大了，本来微不足道的“两只鸡爪子”为供销社积累了几十万元的收入。这个供销社的职工都说，只要帮助农民富起来，我们也就富在其中了。
    很长一段时间内，在商品生产的激烈竞争中，供销社和农民是“自扫门前雪”。农民由于本钱小，势单力薄，遇到风险，常常闹个“连本烂”。１９８７年以来，供销社一改过去的做法，实行了三条措施：一垫付生产资金。去年上半年，永清、廊坊、三河、固安等县、市共拿出３００多万元的资金，用于扶持农民发展养鸽、养羊、养鸭、养鸡等畜禽养殖业。二实行保护价。三河县供销社对扶持起来的肉鸡实行保护价收购。去年上半年，从外地购进的鸡饲料三次涨价，一些大户忧心忡忡，供销社三次上调肉鸡收购价格，使养殖大户避免了损失，稳定了肉鸡生产。三提供设施。为了解决农民买难、卖难、储难、运难的问题，一年来供销社兴办了榨油、屠宰等１９个加工项目，新增一批气调库、冷藏库和运输车辆，提高了加工和储运能力。
    　　　　返利于农　搞好服务
    生产中的利润归农民，经营中的利润归供销社，过去是天经地义的事。正因如此，供销社与农民的关系变成了一种单纯的买卖关系，而买卖双方的利益又往往是此消彼长，于是就出现了买方设法压级压价，甚至拒绝收购；卖方以次顶好、掺杂使假，以至拒绝交售。廊坊地区供销社系统为了改变这种与农民日趋对立的买卖关系，从１９８８年开始，在部分农产品中，特别是一些价格浮动较大的产品中，实行了返利于农的办法。固安县知子营供销社果品合作社，对入股的果农全部实行利润返还。果农交售果品时，供销社除按照合同规定付给价款外，销售后再将利润中的２０％返还给农户。此外，还从剩下的８０％的利润中再提取１０％作为入股果农的红利，实行保息分红。广大果农积极向合作社多交果、交好果，交售量比去年增加７５万多公斤。永清县后奕供销社果品合作社由于实行返利１５％的做法，１９８８年比１９８７年多收购４０万公斤果品。对于一些不便实行利润返还的产品，则采取提取部分利润，用于增建服务设施或购置生产资料的办法，将好处间接返回给农民。
    农民希望自己生产的东西供销社都能包下来，需要的东西供销社都能供得上。怎样满足农民的这一要求？廊坊地区供销社的做法是围绕商品生产基地和大宗产品，建立系列化服务体系。
    霸县南孟镇是传统西瓜产区，年产量达２５００多万公斤。围绕这个基地，镇供销社采取包供应、包技术指导、包运、包销等措施。他们在京津二市建立了信息、销售点，负责提供行情，代订合同，推销产品。农民把供销社当成了自己的“财神爷”。
    为了进一步搞好服务，供销社带头建立了许多专业性服务组织。
    据统计，今年以来，各地成立了养鸡协会、蔬菜服务公司、果品合作社、食用菌科研所等专业服务组织４７个。这些服务组织以供销社为依托，下联若干个生产经营大户，按照自愿互利、民主管理、自主经营的原则，对内以服务为宗旨，对外实行企业化经营，盈利除留一定比例积累外，其余全部按产品交售数量分红。
