Living frugally for over two decades, Wang Xu saved over 10,000 yuan. Recently, he donated 10,000 yuan to the cause of education. This act of benevolence has become a beautiful tale discussed by the people of Wuxi at the start of the new year.

Wang Xu, who once served as the Director of the Industrial Department of Yunnan Province and Vice Chairman of the Political Consultative Conference of Huainan City, Anhui Province, retired to Wuxi, Jiangsu Province in 1985. After silently sweeping the streets of Xin Village for two years, in January 1987, he volunteered to assist with the ideological and political education of students at Liu Tan Junior Middle School in the suburbs of Wuxi.

That autumn, Liu Tan Junior Middle School moved to a new location covering 43.5 mu. Due to insufficient funds, the sports field, which occupies three-quarters of the school's total area, remained a wasteland with gullies and weeds. Students had to conduct their physical education classes and morning exercises in the corridors and walkways.

For this reason, the 73-year-old Wang Xu repeatedly appealed to the township government and the district education bureau: "Physical education must be strengthened from the foundation up; it cannot be neglected!" On December 24 of last year, he handed over a savings book with over 10,000 yuan to the Wuxi Municipal Committee's Bureau of Retired Cadres, requesting that 10,000 yuan be transferred to Liu Tan Junior Middle School to expedite the construction of the sports field.

Wang Xu said, "My capabilities are limited. The purpose of transferring the funds through the Bureau of Retired Cadres is to draw the attention of higher-level leaders and various sectors of society to the growth of young people."

When the reporter visited Wang Xu in Zhuangqian New Village, this old cadre, who joined the party in 1939, was wearing a cloth cap made from old clothes and a black cotton jacket that was washed white and patched in six places. His cupboard contained only a dish of pickled radishes and a half-bowl of tofu stir-fried with cabbage.

It is understood that Wang Xu has no other sources of income besides his salary. The money he donated was "saved from the gaps between his teeth." When asked why he did this, he replied, "Although I have retired, the matters that the Party is concerned about are still deeply ingrained in my heart."

　　节衣缩食廿余年　为国分忧传美谈
    离休干部王旭捐款万元办教育
    本报讯  含辛茹苦２０多年，王旭积蓄了１万多元。最近，他将其中的１万元捐献给教育事业。这一义举，成了新年伊始无锡人民街谈巷议的美谈。
    曾任云南省工业厅厅长、安徽省淮南市政协副主席的王旭，１９８５年离休到江苏省无锡市定居。默默地在新村里扫了２年马路以后，１９８７年１月，他毛遂自荐，到无锡市郊刘潭初级中学，协助做学生的思想政治工作。
    当年初秋，刘潭初中迁往占地４３．５亩的新址上课。由于资金不足，占校园总面积３／４的运动场仍是一片沟坎纵横、蒿草满目的荒地，学生的体育课、广播操不得不在甬道和走廊上进行。
    为此，７３高龄的王旭多次跑到乡政府、区文教局呼吁：“体育要从基础抓起，不抓不得了！”去年１２月２４日，他将一张１万余元的存折送到无锡市委老干部局，请局领导从中取出１万元转赠刘潭初中，促成运动场建设迅速上马。
    王旭说，他的能力太小。通过老干部局转交的目的，是希望引起上级领导和社会各界对青少年成长的重视。
    笔者日前到庄前新村采访王旭时，见这位１９３９年入党的老干部，戴的是自己用旧衣服改制的布帽，穿的是洗得发白、缝补过６处的黑布袄。他的碗橱里，只有一碟萝卜干，半碗白菜烧豆腐。
    据了解，王旭除工资收入外，无其它经济来源。捐献的这笔钱，是他“从牙齿缝里省下来的”。问起为何这样做，他回答：“我人虽离休了，但党正在操心的事情，仍桩桩记在心上。”
