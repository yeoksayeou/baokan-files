The delegation is composed of famous scholars and experts from various important scientific fields in the Soviet Union, including Vice President Nefedov, President of the Academy of Sciences of the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic Sudankhazin, and the directors of the Institute of Technical Physics, the Institute of Mathematics, the Institute of Cybernetics, the Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, and the Institute of Far Eastern Studies of the Soviet Academy of Sciences.

	Mar'chuk, who has served as the chairman of the State Committee for Science and Technology and deputy chairman of the Council of Ministers, is an expert in computational mathematics and nuclear reactor physics. In the VIP lounge at the capital airport, he told reporters, "The meeting of the main scientists of the two countries is a big deal. 'In recent years, we have had some contact with our Chinese counterparts and have begun specific cooperation in some areas. Now we want to expand our cooperation more and more.'"

	It is understood that Mar'chuk and his delegation will hold talks with the delegation from the Chinese Academy of Sciences tomorrow morning to discuss the basic areas of scientific cooperation between the two academies before the year 2000 and specific plans for direct cooperation between the research institutions of the two academies.
