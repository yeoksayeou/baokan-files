The first deputy minister of the Soviet Union's Ministry of Civil Aviation, Panyukov, said at a press conference held in Moscow on February 8 that the Soviet Union will continue to improve civil aviation passenger services on the basis of last year's achievements.

This aviation official said that last year, the Soviet Union's civil aviation sector transported 124 million passengers, but there were still 13 million people who were unable to board flights; the service quality of civil aviation is poor, with some flight attendants being rude to passengers, and there are few ticket offices; the punctuality rate of flights is only 85%.

He said that this year, 33 new domestic routes are planned to be opened, and the civil aviation passenger services in Kamchatka, Magadan, South Sakhalin, Yakutsk, Tyumen, and other places will be improved.

　　苏联改进民航客运工作
  　提高服务质量　开辟新的航线
    新华社莫斯科２月９日电苏联民航部第一副部长帕纽科夫８日在此间举行的记者招待会上说，苏联将在去年取得的成绩基础上继续改进民航客运工作。
    这位民航部负责人说，去年苏联民航部门共运送了１．２４亿名旅客，但仍有１３００万人未能乘上飞机；民航的服务质量差，有的乘务员对旅客态度粗暴，售票点少；航班的正点率只达到８５％。
    他说，今年计划新开辟３３条国内航线，将改进堪察加、马加丹、南萨哈林斯克、雅库特、秋明等地的民航客运工作。
