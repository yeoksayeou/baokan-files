The 19th regular consultations between West Germany and Britain began yesterday in Frankfurt, West Germany. Chancellor Kohl and Prime Minister Thatcher held private meetings last night and this morning, discussing short-range missile modernization, the upcoming NATO summit in London, NATO's overall arms reduction plan, and issues related to the European Community.

It is understood that there are differences of opinion between the two sides on the issue of short-range missile modernization. However, both Kohl and Thatcher expressed confidence that an agreement will be reached before the May London summit. A spokesman for the West German government, Oest, said, "We have made significant progress in many areas." He said that the May London summit will be a meeting that demonstrates "understanding and unity."

Regarding NATO's overall plan, Chancellor Kohl said that the plan must "take into account the interests of all NATO partners," and that short-range missiles must be included in the East-West negotiations. Prime Minister Thatcher has so far taken the stance of refusing to do so, emphasizing the importance of maintaining a strong defense.

Yesterday, Prime Minister Thatcher also attended a luncheon hosted by the President of the West German Federal Bank, Pohl, where they discussed monetary cooperation in Western Europe. This morning, British Defense Minister Young, Home Secretary Hurd, and Agriculture Minister MacGregor held talks with their respective West German counterparts.

　　西德英国首脑在法兰克福会晤
    对短导现代化意见分歧
    本报波恩２月２１日电  记者江建国报道：西德和英国第１９次例行磋商昨天起在西德的法兰克福举行。科尔总理和撒切尔夫人昨天晚上和今天上午举行了私下会晤，就短程导弹现代化、即将召开的北约首脑伦敦会议、北约裁军总体方案以及欧共体问题广泛交换了意见。
    据悉，在短程导弹现代化问题上，双方意见分歧。但科尔和撒切尔夫人都表示相信，在５月份的伦敦会议之前会达成一致。西德政府发言人奥斯特说：“我们在许多方面已经取得很大接近。”他说，５月的伦敦会议将是一次显示“谅解和团结”的会议。
    在谈到北约总体方案时，科尔总理说，这个方案必须“照顾到所有北约伙伴的利益”，短程导弹必须纳入东西方谈判轨道。撒切尔夫人迄今为止的态度是拒绝这样做，她强调保持强大防务的重要性。
    撒切尔夫人昨天还应西德联邦银行行长珀尔邀请出席了午宴，就西欧货币合作进行了交谈。今天上午英国国防大臣扬格、内政大臣赫德、农业大臣麦克格里高尔还同西德有关部长举行对口会谈。
