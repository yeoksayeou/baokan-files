    An official from the Ministry of Justice discussed the key points for legal popularization in 1989, emphasizing that the focus of legal education is on officials at all levels.

    According to a report by our reporter Su Ning: By the end of last year, out of China's 750 million legal education targets, 520 million had completed the study and examination of the "Ten Laws and One Regulation." Recently, our reporter visited the head of the Legal Propaganda Department of the Ministry of Justice to understand that this year's legal popularization work will be carried out in conjunction with the rectification of the economic environment and the regulation of economic order, with a focus on the following aspects.

    This year, the focus of legal propaganda and education is on officials at all levels. County-level and above leaders, based on the completion of the study of the "Ten Laws and One Regulation," will also focus on studying 16 laws and regulations, including the "Law of the People's Republic of China on Industrial Enterprises Owned by the Whole People," the "Notice of the State Council on Cleaning Up Fixed Asset Investment Projects Under Construction, Reducing Investment Scale, and Adjusting Investment Structure," and the "Temporary Regulations on the Construction of Office Buildings." After the study, there will be an examination.

    It is reported that the Internal and Judicial Affairs Committee of the National People's Congress, the Central Propaganda Department, and the Ministry of Justice plan to jointly form a team to examine the legal education and study of provincial-level cadres.

    Strengthen the guidance and management of legal education for urban and rural individual industrial and commercial households, and focus on solving the problem of legal education for the floating population. In addition to studying the "Ten Laws and One Regulation," individual industrial and commercial households should also focus on studying five regulations issued by the State Council, including the "Temporary Provisions on Private Enterprises of the People's Republic of China" and the "Temporary Regulations on the Management of Urban and Rural Individual Industrial and Commercial Households."

    In rural areas, in addition to continuing to complete the remaining two billion farmers' legal education tasks, rural cadres and the masses should also focus on studying three relevant regulations, including the "Decision of the State Council on the Special Management of Fertilizers, Pesticides, and Agricultural Films" and the "Decision of the State Council on Strengthening Grain Management and Stabilizing the Grain Market."

　　司法部有关负责人谈今年普法要点
　　法制教育重点是各级负责干部
    本报讯  记者苏宁报道：截至去年年底，我国７．５亿普法对象中，已有５．２亿通过了“十法一条例”学习、考核。最近，记者走访了司法部法制宣传司负责同志，了解到今年普法工作，将结合治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序工作进行，重点抓以下几件事。
    今年法制宣传教育的重点是各级负责干部。县团级以上领导干部，在已完成“十法一条例”学习的基础上，今年还要着重学习《中华人民共和国全民所有制工业企业法》、《国务院关于清理固定资产投资在建项目、压缩投资规模、调整投资结构的通知》、《楼堂馆所建设暂行条例》等１６个法律、法规，学习结束后要进行考核。
    据悉，全国人大内务司法委员会、中宣部、司法部三家拟联合组团对省级干部普法学习情况进行考核。
    加强对城乡个体工商户普法学习的指导和管理，重点解决好对流动人口的法制教育问题。个体工商户除学习“十法一条例”以外，还应重点学习《中华人民共和国私营企业暂行规定》、《城乡个体工商户管理暂行条例》等５个国务院发布的有关条例。
    在广大农村，除继续完成剩余的两亿农民普法任务外，农村干部和群众还要着重学习《国务院关于化肥、农药、农膜实行专营的决定》和《国务院关于加强粮食管理、稳定粮食市场的决定》等三个有关规定。
