Italy will soon lift import quotas on 10 to 15 Japanese products as the first step toward fully removing restrictions on Japanese goods.

This was the main outcome of a meeting held today in Rome between Italian Foreign Trade Minister Ruggero and Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) Trade Policy Bureau Director Murakami Hideshi.

According to the agreement reached by both sides, Italy's current quota restrictions on 41 Japanese products will be gradually lifted in four phases. Starting from January 1, 1992, except for automobiles, motorcycles with engine displacements less than 380 cc, sewing machines, and electronic products, all other products will be allowed to enter the Italian market freely.

Rome, February 5 (Reported by Luo Jinbiao): Italy's trade deficit in 1988 reached 128.63 billion lira (approximately $95 billion), an increase of about 15% compared to 1987.

According to statistics released yesterday by the Italian Central Statistical Office, compared to the previous year, Italy's imports in 1988 increased by 11.4%, while exports increased by 11.1%. The trade deficit in agriculture and food alone was as high as 174.4 billion lira. Although oil imports decreased by about 30 billion lira due to falling oil prices, the deficit still reached 158.74 billion lira.

However, the main reason for the increase in Italy's trade deficit is that domestic demand has significantly increased, while the surplus in traditional products such as metal machinery and textiles has significantly decreased.

　　意大利将部分取消对日商品进口限制
  　去年外贸赤字达１２万亿多里拉
    新华社罗马２月７日电  意大利政府不久将取消对１０至１５种日本产品的进口配额限制，作为全面取消对日货进口限制的第一步。
    这是意大利外贸部长鲁杰罗今天在此与日本通产省通商政策局长村岗秀生举行会谈取得的主要成果。
    根据双方达成的协议，目前意大利对４１种日本货实行的配额限制，将分４个阶段逐步取消。从１９９２年１月１日起，除汽车、汽缸容积小于３８０毫升的摩托车、缝纫机和电子产品外，其它产品均可自由进入意大利市场。
    本报罗马２月５日电　记者罗晋标报道：１９８８年意大利外贸赤字达１２．８６３万亿里拉（约合９５亿美元），比１９８７年增加１５％左右。
    据意大利中央统计局昨天公布的统计，同上年相比，１９８８年意大利进口增加１１．４％，出口增加１１．１％。仅农业和食品进出口赤字高达１７．４４万亿里拉；石油进口虽因油价下跌而减少了约３万亿里拉开支，但其赤字仍达１５．８７４万亿里拉。
    然而，造成意大利外贸赤字增加的主要原因在于，一方面是国内需求大量增长，另方面是五金机械、纺织品等传统产品进出口顺差明显减少。
