Li Peng, at a meeting of the National Commission for Economic Restructuring staff, said that in the next two years, we must focus on rectifying the economic environment and restoring economic order. We must integrate rectification and order with deepening reforms, further summarize experiences, strengthen confidence, and gradually establish a new socialist planned commodity economy order.

Li Peng said that since the Third Plenum of the Thirteenth Central Committee, the work of rectifying and restoring economic order has achieved initial results. The key issue at present is to correctly handle the relationship between rectification and order and deepening reforms, and not to oppose the two. We should not think that rectification and order mean reversing course just because we are focusing on these tasks. Nor should we think that the reforms are wrong and lose confidence in reform just because we are emphasizing rectification and order. Reform is a major trend in contemporary socialist countries. Over the past decade of reform and opening up, our country has achieved tremendous successes. We must adhere to two unchanging principles: first, the overall policy of reform and opening up established by the Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee and the Thirteenth National Congress will not change; second, the policy of rectification and order for the next two years established by the Third Plenum of the Thirteenth Central Committee will not change.

Li Peng said that reform is a complex economic and social system engineering project, an unprecedented exploratory endeavor, and we must seriously summarize experiences. In pursuing a socialist commodity economy, we must adhere to two principles: first, we must maintain a multi-ownership system with public ownership as the mainstay. The form of public ownership can change, but its essence cannot. Second, we must maintain a multi-distribution system with distribution according to work as the mainstay. We must, on the premise of fully affirming the policy of reform and opening up, realistically summarize the experiences of reform and construction, and push reform forward.

While acknowledging the achievements of the National Commission for Economic Restructuring, Li Peng pointed out that during the period of rectification and order, the commission is not inactive but has much to do. Everyone should throw themselves into rectification and order, actively contribute to the establishment of a macro-control system, and explore and pilot new reform measures. He emphasized that the people support reform. Without the people's support, neither rectification and order nor deepening reforms can succeed. He hoped that all comrades of the National Commission for Economic Restructuring would firmly remember this, strengthen their confidence, and make greater contributions to the cause of reform, opening up, and construction in the future.

　　李鹏在国家体改委机关干部会上说
    搞好治理整顿　增强改革信心
    新华社北京２月１日电  国务院总理兼国家体改委主任李鹏今天上午在国家体改委机关干部会议上说，今后两年我们要一心一意搞好治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序的工作，把治理、整顿与深化改革紧密结合起来，进一步总结经验，坚定信心，逐步建立社会主义有计划的商品经济新秩序。
    李鹏说，党的十三届三中全会以来，治理、整顿经济的工作已经取得初步成效。当前的一个重要问题是，要正确处理好治理、整顿与深化改革的关系，不要把两者对立起来。不能一提治理、整顿，就认为走回头路了；也不能一提治理、整顿，就认为改错了，对改革失去了信心。改革是当今社会主义国家的一大潮流。我国改革开放十年来取得了巨大的成就，我们必须坚持两个不变：一是十一届三中全会和十三大制定的改革开放总方针不变；二是十三届三中全会确定的今明两年的治理和整顿方针不变。
    李鹏说，改革是一项复杂的经济社会系统工程，是前无古人的探索性事业，必须认真总结经验。搞社会主义商品经济必须坚持两条：一是坚持以公有制为主体的多种所有制形式。公有制的形式可以改变，但不能改变公有制的实质。二是坚持以按劳分配为主体的多种分配方式。我们要在充分肯定改革开放方针的前提下，实事求是地总结改革和建设的经验，把改革推向前进。
    李鹏在肯定了体改委工作成绩的同时指出，在治理、整顿时期，体改部门不是无所作为，而是大有可为的。大家要投身到治理、整顿中去，积极为建立宏观调控体系献计献策，对一些新的改革措施进行探索和试点。他强调，人民是支持改革的。没有人民的支持，无论治理、整顿还是深化改革，都不可能成功。他希望，所有体改委的同志必须牢牢记住这一点，坚定信心，在今后的工作中为改革开放和建设事业做出更大的贡献。
