By the end of 1988, Hainan Province had 262,000 households with 1.3 million people who had basically solved their food and clothing problems, among whom 370,000 people had begun to walk the path to prosperity.

Hainan has long been a closed-off region and is one of the main poverty-stricken areas in China. According to the standard set by the State Council, where the per capita income is below 200 yuan and the grain ration is below 200 kilograms, there are still 770,000 people living below the poverty line. This serious issue is a major obstacle facing Hainan in its efforts to build a province and a large special economic zone. After Hainan became a province, the provincial government took the task of solving the food and clothing problems of the people in poverty-stricken areas as a key part of improving Hainan's investment environment. In the poverty alleviation work, all localities in the province have strengthened their leadership over poverty-stricken cities and counties, organized forces to conduct a comprehensive survey and investigation of poverty-stricken towns and villages, established files for poverty-stricken households, and set up poverty alleviation offices at various levels. In its poverty alleviation work, Hainan Province has paid attention to using limited poverty alleviation funds to train township and village cadres and technical personnel in poverty-stricken areas. In one year, more than 3,000 cadres and nearly 20,000 technical personnel were trained. At the same time, various localities mobilized and relied on scientific and technical personnel and skilled workers to establish economic entities. By the end of last year, poverty-stricken areas had established 2,000 economic entities, benefiting 5,334 poverty-stricken households.

　　海南省２０多万贫困户基本脱贫    
    ３７万人开始走上致富道路
    本报海口讯  记者罗自苏报道：截至１９８８年底，海南省已有２６．２万户１３０万人基本解决了温饱问题，其中３７万人开始走上致富路。
    海南长期闭锁，是我国主要的贫困地区之一，按国务院规定的人均收入２００元、口粮２００公斤以下的标准计算，目前尚有７７万多人处于贫困线以下。这个严峻的问题是海南建省办大特区面临的严重障碍。海南建省后，省政府把解决贫困地区人民温饱作为改善海南投资环境的工作来抓。在扶贫工作中，全省各地切实加强对贫困市、县的领导，组织力量对贫困乡村进行全面普查摸底，建立贫困户档案，设置各级扶贫办事机构。海南省在扶贫工作中，注意将有限的扶贫资金用于对贫困地区乡镇干部和技术人员普遍进行培训，一年内培训干部３０００多人，培训各种技术人才近２万人次。同时，各地发动和依靠科技人员、能工巧匠兴办经济实体。到去年底，贫困地区已办实体２０００个，带动贫困户５３３４户。
