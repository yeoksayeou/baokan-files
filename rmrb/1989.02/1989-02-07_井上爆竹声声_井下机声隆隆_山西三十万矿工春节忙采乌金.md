Firecrackers crackle above, machinery roars below: 300,000 miners in Shanxi work through the Spring Festival

According to Xinhua News Agency, Taigu, February 6 — As the nation celebrates the Spring Festival, reuniting with family and welcoming the new year, 300,000 miners in Shanxi, the country's coal energy base, are working tirelessly underground. According to relevant departments, Shanxi alone can produce over 15 million tons of raw coal from the first to the third day of the Lunar New Year, equivalent to the annual output of a large mine.

On the first day of the Lunar New Year, officials from the Shanxi Provincial Economic Commission divided into five groups, visiting coal mines and railways, working alongside the miners and celebrating the New Year with them.

In state-owned coal mines such as Yangquan, Xishan, and Datong, the night of New Year's Eve saw a vast expanse of coal fields illuminated. Above ground, firecrackers crackled, and joy filled the air. Below ground, machinery roared, and miners focused intently on their work. As the massive coal-cutting machines moved slowly, the gleaming "black gold" rolled out in abundance.

The Datong Coal Mining Bureau is the largest coal enterprise in the country. This Spring Festival, over 7,000 miners requested to return home to celebrate. Bureau Director Ma Jie and Party Secretary Liu Shouren personally conducted surveys, visited base-level mines, and addressed the miners' practical difficulties. They not only distributed New Year's supplies to the miners but also arranged for special personnel to manage the kitchen, ensuring the miners' New Year's meals and organizing cultural activities. This way, miners working in the mines feel at home and enjoy a festive atmosphere. Over 5,000 miners voluntarily gave up returning home to celebrate the New Year, choosing instead to work on the coal mining and excavation frontlines. Currently, the morale of Datong Coal Mining Bureau miners is high. On New Year's Eve, they produced 28,465 tons of coal. The raw coal output during the Spring Festival is expected to reach 100,000 tons.

　　井上爆竹声声　井下机声隆隆
　　山西三十万矿工春节忙采乌金
    据新华社太原２月６日电  （记者崔济哲）正值全国人民合家团聚，辞旧迎新之际，在全国煤炭能源基地的山西省却有３０万矿工正紧张地奋战在千里地下煤海。据有关部门预测，仅春节初一至初三，全省就可以生产原煤１５０多万吨，相当于一个大型矿井一年的产量。
    正月初一，山西省经委负责同志分成五个小组，带队下基层，深入到煤矿、铁路，和工人们一起工作，一起过年。
    阳泉、西山、大同等国家统配煤矿，除夕之夜，百里煤海一片通明。井上爆竹声声，欢天喜地，井下机声隆隆，全神贯注。随着巨大的割煤机缓缓移动，闪光发亮的“乌金”滚滚“外流”。
    大同矿务局是全国最大的煤炭企业，今年春节要求回家过年的矿工多达７０００多人。矿务局局长马杰、党委书记刘守仁亲自摸底，深入基层矿井做工作，帮助矿工解决实际困难，他们既把春节供应的副食品送到矿工手中，又有专人负责下厨房搞好职工春节生活，安排好文体活动，让矿工在矿上过年不想家，在矿上过年胜过家。５０００多矿工自愿放弃回家团聚过年，下井坚持在采掘第一线。现在大同矿务局矿工士气正高，除夕之夜就出煤２８４６５吨。春节期间原煤产量可望达到十万吨。
