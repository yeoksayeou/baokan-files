	Consumer complaints surged last year, with nearly 130,000 cases handled, most of which were resolved satisfactorily. The Consumer Protection Act is included in this year's legislative plan.

	BEIJING, Feb. 23 (Xinhua) -- A consumer complaint and tip led to the discovery that the Shengmei Company was illegally operating 5,000 imported refrigerators. After the Xi'an Municipal Consumer Association received and assisted relevant departments in investigating the case, the company's illegal income of 1.65 million yuan was confiscated.

	An official from the China Consumer Association said today that such examples of discovering leads from public complaints and assisting relevant departments in handling cases are common in consumer associations across the country. In 1988, consumer organizations nationwide handled approximately 129,000 consumer complaints, exceeding the total of the previous three years. More than 85% of the issues raised in the complaints were resolved satisfactorily, recovering losses for the public amounting to over 47 million yuan. He said, "Consumer associations have become an important channel for the Party and the government to connect with the people and a significant force in social supervision."

	It is understood that by the end of 1988, there were 1,170 county-level consumer organizations nationwide, along with more than 5,000 grassroots outlets spread across neighborhoods, enterprises, and rural areas. Last year, during the handling of complaints, special attention was given to issues such as mandatory bundling, price gouging, and arbitrary fees in the home appliance industry, which have a wide impact and severely harm consumer interests.

	BEIJING, Feb. 23 (Xinhua) -- It is learned that after Fujian, Hubei, and Shenyang promulgated the "Regulations (or Provisions) on Protecting Consumer Legal Rights" in 1987, 12 provinces and municipalities, including Jiangsu, Guizhou, Jilin, Sichuan, Zhejiang, Shandong, Hebei, Anhui, Shanghai, Beijing, Qingdao, and Guangzhou, promulgated special regulations on protecting consumer rights in 1988. The "Provisions on Protecting Consumer Legal Rights" drafted by the China Consumer Association, after being revised four times by relevant experts, has been included in the 1989 legislative plan by the Legislative Affairs Office of the State Council. It is reported that the consumer protection regulations already promulgated in various places have clearly defined consumers' rights, the responsibilities of producers and operators, the powers of consumer associations, the management, supervision, and penalties for behaviors that harm consumer interests, as well as the procedures and statutes of limitations for handling cases.

　　消费者投诉去年激增
    十多万件投诉案多数获得合理解决 
    保护消费者条例列入今年立法计划
    本报北京２月２３日讯  记者潘岗报道：一消费者投诉检举，深美公司违法经营进口电冰箱５０００台。西安市消费者协会受理并协助有关部门查实后，这家公司１６５万元的非法收入即被没收。
    中国消费者协会负责人今天在此间称，像这样从群众投诉中发现线索，协助有关部门查处的事例，在各地消费者协会中普遍存在。１９８８年，各地消费者组织共受理消费者投诉约１２．９万件，超过前３年的总和，投诉的问题８５％以上得到合理解决，为群众挽回的损失达４７００多万元。他说：“消费者协会已成为党和政府联系群众的一条重要渠道，成为社会监督的一支重要力量。”
    据了解，到１９８８年底，全国已有县以上消费者组织１１７０个，另外还有遍布街道、企业、农村的基层网点５０００余个。去年在受理投诉的过程中，突出抓了家电经营中的硬性搭配、乱涨价、乱收费等涉及面广、影响大、损害消费者利益严重的问题的处理。
    本报北京２月２３日讯　记者潘岗今天从中国消费者协会了解到：继１９８７年福建、湖北、沈阳颁布《保护消费者合法权益条例》（或规定）后，１９８８年又有江苏、贵州、吉林、四川、浙江、山东、河北、安徽、上海、北京、青岛、广州１２省市颁布了保护消费者权益的专门法规。由中国消费者协会起草的全国《保护消费者合法权益条例》，经过有关专家４次修改后，已被国务院法制局列入１９８９年立法计划。据介绍，各地已颁布的保护消费者权益法规，普遍对消费者的权利、生产者和经营者的责任、消费者协会的职权、损害消费者利益行为的管理、监督、处罚，以及处理程序和时效等，作了明确规定。
