The UN Security Council today voted on a draft resolution regarding the "Situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territories." Due to a veto by the United States, the resolution did not pass.

The draft resolution, proposed by Algeria and six other countries, expressed "strong regret" over Israel's disregard for previous Security Council resolutions and its failure to comply with the Fourth Geneva Convention on the protection of civilians during wartime. It criticized Israel for violating the human rights of Palestinians and suppressing them in the occupied Palestinian territories. During the vote, all 15 members, except the United States, voted in favor. Only the United States voted against it.

The Chinese delegation hopes that the Security Council will respond firmly to the recent intensification of repression by the Israeli authorities in the occupied Palestinian territories and take effective measures to prevent the situation from deteriorating further.

Chinese Ambassador to the United Nations, Li Lu Ye, emphasized in his speech at the Security Council meeting today that the fundamental solution to the deep suffering of the Palestinian people lies in a comprehensive, just, and lasting peace settlement of the Middle East problem, including its core issue, the Palestinian question.

    我代表希望安理会制止以占区局势恶化
    本报联合国２月１７日电  本报记者刘开宸报道：联合国安理会今天下午投票表决关于“被占领的巴勒斯坦领土局势”决议草案时，由于美国否决，未获通过。
    这项由阿尔及利亚等７国提出的决议草案，对以色列不顾安理会历次有关决议，不遵守有关战时保护平民的《第４项日内瓦公约》，在被占领的巴勒斯坦领土上违反巴勒斯坦人人权、镇压巴勒斯坦人，表示“强烈遗憾”。表决时，全体１５个成员中，中国等１４国赞成，只有美国一家反对。
    本报联合国２月１７日电　记者刘开宸报道：中国代表团希望安理会对以色列当局最近在被占领的巴勒斯坦领土上强化镇压作出坚定反应，并采取有效措施，制止局势继续恶化。
    中国常驻联合国代表李鹿野大使今天在安理会会议上发言中强调，结束巴勒斯坦人民深重灾难的根本出路在于中东问题及其核心巴勒斯坦问题全面、公正、持久的和平解决。
