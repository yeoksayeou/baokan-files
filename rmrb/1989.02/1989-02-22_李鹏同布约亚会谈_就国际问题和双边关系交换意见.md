Li Peng Meets with Buyoya to Discuss International Issues and Bilateral Relations

	Beijing, February 21 (Reported by Sun Yi) — Premier Li Peng met with Pierre Buyoya, Chairman of the National Salvation Military Committee and President of the Republic of Burundi, at the Great Hall of the People this morning. The two sides exchanged views on major international issues and bilateral relations.

	Li Peng said that China pursues a policy of good-neighborliness and friendship in its foreign relations. He noted that China and African countries have good cooperative relations and no conflicts of interest.

	Li Peng said that China is pleased to see that the situation in Africa, particularly in Southern Africa, is showing signs of easing. However, he believes that the South African authorities have not abandoned their policies of external aggression and internal racial discrimination, and the international community should continue to exert pressure on the South African authorities.

	Regarding the issue of African debt, Li Peng said that there are indeed unequal economic relations in the world today, and one important reason for this situation is the existence of an unfair international economic order. If this problem is not resolved, it may exacerbate conflicts. Western creditor countries should adopt an enlightened attitude on this issue. The Chinese government has consistently supported the just stance of African countries on the debt issue and supports the convening of an international conference on African debt when conditions are ripe.

	Buyoya said that Burundi's foreign policy is based on good-neighborliness, promoting international cooperation, and supporting genuine national liberation movements. Burundi's goal is to maintain peace and stability in the region so that the Burundian people can focus their efforts on development.

	President Buyoya believes that the current easing of relations between major powers is influencing the African continent, and the situation in Africa is developing in a positive direction.

	He said that there are unequal economic relations in the world, and Africa's trade conditions are deteriorating, while the related issue of African debt is becoming more serious. Burundi is willing to work with all countries to seek fundamental solutions to these problems.

	During the talks, both sides expressed that China and Burundi have consistent or similar positions on some major international issues. Both sides are satisfied with the development of bilateral relations and expressed a desire to further strengthen and develop friendly cooperative relations between the two countries.

　　李鹏同布约亚会谈
    就国际问题和双边关系交换意见
    本报北京２月２１日讯  记者孙毅报道：国务院总理李鹏今天上午在人民大会堂同布隆迪救国军事委员会主席、共和国总统皮埃尔·布约亚举行会谈，双方就重大的国际问题和双边关系问题交换了意见。
    李鹏说，中国执行睦邻友好的对外政策。他说，中国和非洲国家间有着良好的合作关系，没有利害冲突。
    李鹏说，中国高兴地看到，非洲大陆、特别是南部非洲出现了缓和迹象。但他认为，南非当局并没有放弃对外侵略、对内搞种族歧视政策，国际社会应对南非当局继续保持压力。
    关于非洲债务问题，李鹏说，当前世界上确实存在着不平等的经济关系，造成这种状况的一个重要原因是存在着不公平的国际经济秩序。这个问题不解决，将可能激化矛盾，西方债权国应在这个问题上持开明态度。中国政府一贯支持非洲国家在债务问题上的正义立场，支持在条件成熟时召开非洲债务的国际会议。
    布约亚说，布隆迪的对外政策是基于睦邻友好、促进国际合作和支持真正的民族解放运动。布隆迪的目标是维护所在地区的和平和稳定，以便能使布隆迪人民把主要力量投入发展。
    布约亚总统认为，当前大国之间的关系出现了缓和，这种缓和的趋势在影响着非洲大陆，非洲形势正朝着积极的方向发展。
    他说，世界上存在着不平等的经济关系，非洲的贸易条件在恶化，而与此相关的非洲债务问题也更趋严重，布隆迪愿同世界各国努力寻求对这些问题的根本解决。
    会谈时双方都表示，中、布两国在一些重大国际问题上立场一致或接近。双方都对两国关系的发展感到满意，并都表示要进一步加强和发展双边友好合作关系。
