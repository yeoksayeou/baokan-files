The Shengli Refinery of the Qilu Petrochemical Company, located in Zibo, Shandong, has seen its processing capacity increase for four consecutive years. In 1985, the refinery processed 5.5 million tons of crude oil, and by 1988, this figure had risen to 6.388 million tons, generating a profit and tax revenue of 670 million yuan.

The Shengli Refinery is a large-scale enterprise with nearly 8,000 employees, annually supplying the state with over 5 million tons of gasoline and other products. To increase production and alleviate supply-demand conflicts, the refinery has implemented a series of reforms: introducing a competitive mechanism into the management and personnel systems, allowing administrative heads to nominate deputies, and establishing a system where the tenure of heads determines that of their deputies. For middle-level cadres, a 3-to-6-month probation period has been instituted, placing the selected candidates under the public supervision of the broader workforce, thereby enhancing their sense of responsibility, pressure, and competitive spirit. In terms of distribution, the factory has linked the total wage bill to economic performance, thereby boosting the enthusiasm of the workers, whose annual income has also shown significant growth.

　　胜利炼油厂加工能力连年提高
    本报讯  记者宋学春、王彦田报道：位于山东淄博的齐鲁石油化工公司胜利炼油厂，连续４年加工能力不断上升，１９８５年加工原油５５０万吨，１９８８年已达６３８．８万吨，创利税６．７亿元。
    胜利炼油厂是一家大型企业，有近８０００名职工，每年向国家提供５００多万吨汽油及其他产品。为增加生产，缓解供求矛盾，炼油厂进行了一系列改革：把竞争机制引进干部、人事制度中，实行行政正职对副职提名，规定以正职聘期决定副职聘期的制约办法；对中层干部实行３至６个月的见习制度，将选聘对象置于广大职工的公开监督之下，增强选聘对象的责任感、压力感和竞争心理。在分配上，这个厂实现了工资总额与经济效益挂钩，从而调动了职工生产积极性，他们的年收入也有明显增长。
