Title: Should Using a Pen Name Require Permission from Leaders?

Recently, a certain school experienced a commotion. A teacher published an article in a journal using a pen name, for which he was rebuked by the school leadership: “You used a pen name without the leader’s approval. Do you have any sense of leadership?”

The idea that using a pen name in a journal article without leadership approval is a lack of “leadership awareness” is truly astonishing. Reflecting on this, one worries that even today, some leaders insist on this “leadership awareness,” clearly ignorant of or poorly informed about certain work situations, yet insist on “setting the standard” themselves. They demand that subordinates’ every word and action must align with their thoughts and intentions; otherwise, they label them with big hats or even retaliate. This can only bring harm to the work and lower the leader's authority.

It is worth pondering that for these leaders, the past ten years of reform seem to have passed without much impact. They often use reform as a catchphrase, but they never think about reforming this outdated “leadership awareness.” I ask, if this “leadership awareness” does not change, how can we advance the construction of socialist democratic politics?

### 用笔名也要请示领导吗？

　　用笔名也要请示领导吗？
　　何山
    最近，某学校发生一场风波。一位教师在刊物上发表文章时用了笔名，因此遭到校领导指斥：“不经领导同意就用笔名，你这个人还有没有领导观念？”弄得那位教师哭笑不得。
    在刊物上发表文章署笔名，未经领导批准就是“没有领导观念”，这样的怪论真是令人吃惊。联想起来，叫人担心的是，至今还有一些领导干部坚持这样的“领导观念”，明明是自己对某些工作的情况无知或知之不多，却非要坚持“以我为标准”，下属的一切言论、行动均要称我心、遂我意，否则，就给人家扣上大帽子，甚至打击报复。这就只能给工作带来损失，并且降低领导者的威信。
    值得深思的是，十年改革对这些领导者来说，仿佛雨过地皮湿。他们也常常把改革当作口头禅，可始终未想到改革改革这种落后于时代的“领导观念”，试问，这样的“领导观念”如果不改变，怎能推进社会主义民主政治的建设？
