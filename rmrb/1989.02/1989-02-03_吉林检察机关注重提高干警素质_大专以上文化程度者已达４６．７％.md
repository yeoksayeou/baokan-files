The procuratorate of Jilin Province has been focusing on improving the political, cultural, and professional qualifications of its officers, leading to new developments in various procuratorial works. Over the past four years, there have been no cases of wrongful detention or prosecution in criminal investigations. More than 9,000 economic and disciplinary cases have been handled, recovering approximately 200 million yuan for the state.

With the continuous improvement of socialist legal systems, various crimes, especially bribery and corruption, have become increasingly hidden and complex. To adapt to this situation, it is necessary to cultivate a team of professionals. The Jilin Provincial Procuratorate Party Committee has therefore formulated a "Five-Year Plan for Staff Education," clearly stating that from 1985 to 1990, the proportion of officers with a law degree should increase from the current 17% to 50%. Various levels of procuratorates across the province have adopted methods such as leveraging social education resources, internal training, and encouraging self-study. Over 1,800 officers have participated in various college-level courses, led by the procuratorate leadership. Despite financial constraints and tight case-handling budgets, they have raised funds for intellectual investment, spending over 3.08 million yuan on staff training over the past four years. Currently, 53% of procurators at various levels have graduated from various colleges; 46.7% of officers have reached a college-level education or higher, leading the nation's procuratorial system.

The change in the educational structure of officers has effectively improved their political and professional qualifications, promoting the development of procuratorial work. Many officers voluntarily implement party policies and accurately apply laws, ensuring that economic and disciplinary cases are handled quickly and with high quality. In early 1986, the Jilin City Procuratorate handled a significant case of financial corruption, unprecedented in the financial system since the founding of the nation. After the criminal fled, the procuratorate immediately organized a skilled investigation team, traveling to Beijing, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Harbin, and 14 other provinces and cities. In just 9 days and 9 nights, the criminal was apprehended. Now, the procuratorial system in this province is handling disciplinary cases better than ever. Last year, the accuracy rate for disciplinary cases filed and prosecuted by the procuratorial system across the province reached 100%, with the number of cases handled per person ranking at the forefront of the nation. Public prosecution capabilities and court performance have also significantly improved. The province has produced more than 40 outstanding prosecutors, two of whom have been awarded the title of "Business Expert" by the Supreme People's Procuratorate.

　　吉林检察机关注重提高干警素质
    大专以上文化程度者已达４６．７％
    本报讯  吉林省检察机关注重提高干警政治、文化和业务素质，使各项检察工作出现新局面。近四年来，全省刑事检察工作无错捕、错诉，共查处经济和法纪案件９０００多件，为国家挽回损失约２亿元。
    随着社会主义法制的不断健全，各类犯罪、特别是贪污受贿手段日趋隐蔽、复杂。为了适应这个斗争形势，必须培养一支精通业务的干部队伍。吉林省检察院党组为此制订了《干部教育五年规划》，向全省各级检察院明确提出，从１９８５年至１９９０年五年内，法律大专毕业生要从现有的１７％提高到５０％。全省各级检察院采取依托社会办学、本系统办学和鼓励自学相结合的办法，由院领导带头，参加各类大专院校学习的干警有１８００多人。在财政压缩、办案经费紧张的情况下，他们自筹资金进行智力投资，四年来用于干部培训经费达３０８万多元。目前，全省已有５３％的各级院检察长毕业于各类大专院校；有４６．７％干警达到大专以上文化程度，居全国检察系统之首。
    干警文化结构的改变，有效地提高了政治素质和业务素质，促进了检察工作的开展。许多干警自觉执行党的政策，准确运用法律，使经济和法纪案件办得快，质量高。１９８６年初，吉林市检察院受理了一起建国以来金融系统罕见的大贪污案。罪犯潜逃后，这个院立即组织精干的侦破队伍，相继赶往北京、广州、深圳、哈尔滨等１７个省、市，仅９天９夜时间，就将罪犯一举抓获。现在这个省检察机关的法纪案件也越办越好。去年全省检察系统法纪立案案件和起诉案件的准确率均达到１００％，人均办案数位于全国前列。公诉能力和出庭水平也明显提高。全省涌现出４０多名优秀公诉人，其中有２人还被最高人民检察院授予业务能手光荣称号。    　（祝连勇　陈美凤）
