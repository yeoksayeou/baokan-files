	Home Town Tea
	Mù Xián

	Dragging two legs afflicted with severe rheumatoid arthritis, he had traveled for nearly forty years. He finally returned from the other side of the sea. Back to his hometown. However, because of his legs, he could no longer visit the mountains and rivers that often haunted his dreams.

	So, he spent his days sitting in the hall, leisurely sipping tea.

	He still spoke with a hometown accent. However, due to the loss of three teeth, his words were indistinct, requiring others to listen carefully. His lifestyle, though, had changed a lot. Take his tea-drinking habit, for example; it had acquired many refinements not native to his hometown. In his hometown, tea was drunk in a rather rough manner. A small amount of tea leaves was placed in a cup, poured over with boiling water, and then sipped while blowing away the tea stems. He, however, required a set of small teapots and cups similar to those used for Guangdong-style tea. He would place half a pot of tea leaves, first pour boiling water over them and then discard it to remove dust and impurities. He would then pour in more water, cover the pot, and let it steep for a while. Only then would he pour the tea into small cups, one cup at a time, one sip at a time, like drinking wine. His younger brother's family naturally did not have such tea sets, so they used a large, colorful, glazed cup and four small wine cups as substitutes.

	The tea leaves, however, were authentic hometown tea. Initially, his nephew had prepared some high-quality jasmine tea for him, but he refused it. He disliked the floral scent that overpowered the tea flavor. Instead, he preferred this common, homemade original tea. It was thick and strong, initially bitter and astringent, but after a while, a refreshing aroma would emerge on the tip of the tongue.

	During childhood, he often played and fought with his younger brother over a roasted sweet potato or a sparrow. Now, his younger brother's head was also streaked with gray. With a gentleness he had never seen before, he sat silently beside him. His niece-in-law moved lightly and quietly, coming and going to refill his cup with water.

	His grandchildren, however, were quite mischievous, running around and playing near his knees, making noise in the hall. Taking advantage of the commotion, his younger brother would glare, and his niece-in-law would scold. But he would only smile. He couldn't remember any of his grandchildren's names. Even his nephews and nieces, he would sometimes call the wrong person.

	It was no wonder; with people coming and going all day, how could he remember everyone? They were all born after he left his hometown. But those unfamiliar faces, which must be relatives, all smiled at him. They smiled like a patch of warm sunlight. He might not remember the faces, but that patch of sunlight warmed him.

	“Quick, call Grandpa!”

	His niece and her husband brought back their not-yet-one-year-old child, Mao Mao, to see him. Mao Mao cooed and babbled but couldn't speak. His niece insisted that he call out. He reached out to take the child in his lap, but Mao Mao knocked over his teacup, spilling water all over the table. “Oh!” he laughed, because the child had also urinated on his leg. The room was in a flurry. Wiping the table, cleaning his pants, changing the tea, and refilling the water, everyone rushed over. That warmth and wetness seeped into his heart.

	His nephew returned, carrying a bowl of tofu brain. This was the dish he had specified. He had also specified that it should be made with fermented soybean paste. As for dishes like soft-shelled turtles and frogs, he waved his hand in refusal. Finally, his youngest son, who had been traveling between the mountains and rivers, returned. It was time for him to leave. The room was filled with gifts. Things like angelica, red dates, century eggs, and Hunan embroidery. He shook his head at all of them. His younger brother tentatively asked:

	“Brother, what do you want to take with you?”

	“Tea. Original tea.”

	He said leisurely. He wanted to take with him that thick, strong, bitter yet sweet taste of hometown affection.

　　故乡茶
    慕贤
    拖着两条患有严重风湿关节炎的腿，几乎跋涉了四十年。他终于从海的那一边回来了。回到了故乡。然而，也因了这腿，他不再能够去看那每每在他梦中萦绕的山山水水。
    于是，便整日的坐在厅里，悠悠地品茶。
    他依旧是一口乡音。不过因脱落了三颗牙而关不住风，吐字便含混，需得人去细细地辨。生活习惯却是改了许多。看这喝茶吧，就有了许多不属于家乡的讲究。家乡的喝茶，是比较粗糙的。在杯中放少量茶叶，用滚水冲开，便边吹着茶梗边喝。他却需得一套类似广东喝功夫茶的小壶小盅茶具，放上半壶茶叶，先用滚水冲入后即倒，以去灰尘与杂味。再冲水，盖上，少闷片刻。这才筛入一只只小杯，一杯杯，一口口地品。像喝酒。他弟弟家自然没这类茶具，只以一满花釉下彩大杯与四个小酒杯代用。
    茶叶，用的却是地道的家乡原茶。起始，侄儿为他备有高档的茉莉花茶，他不要。嫌那花香盖去了茶味。倒是这家常的、土制的原茶好。浓浓的、酽酽的，初品有苦涩，少顷舌尖便生出清香来。
    童年时，为一块烤红薯，一只麻雀而常和他打闹的弟弟，如今也已满头斑白。用他不曾见过的温顺，陪他默默地坐。侄媳轻手轻脚地来来去去，为他往杯里续水。
    孙辈的几个细伢、细妹子却是皮得很，在厅堂里吵吵闹闹，跑来跑去地绕着他的膝头玩。趁着人来风。他弟弟鼓眼睛，他侄媳断喝。他却只望着笑。这些孙辈的伢妹，他叫不出一个名字。就是侄辈，他偶尔喊一声，也常常喊错了人。
    也难怪，整日的人来人去，叫他猛地能记住谁？全都是他离乡他去后出世的。但那一张张陌生的又必定是亲人的脸，都向他笑。笑得像一片片温暖的阳光。脸的肥瘦他虽然记不清，但那片片阳光，却让他温暖。
    “快喊伯爷爷！”
    满侄女和他丈夫抱着不足一岁的毛毛又回来看他。毛毛咿咿呀呀，却不会说话。满侄女偏偏就要他喊。他伸手接过来抱在膝上，毛毛却一伸手打翻了他的茶杯，洒一桌的水。“噢！”他笑着喊。因为还有一泡尿屙到了他腿上。温温的，湿湿的。满屋里便慌了神。抹桌的、擦裤的、换茶的、续水的便一齐拥上来。那温温湿湿便浸润到了他心上。
    侄儿归来了，端一盆豆腐脑。这是他指定的菜肴。还指定要用豆豉水来打汤。至于那些甲鱼、田鸡一类，他却直摆手。终于，从山水之间旅游的小儿子回来了。到了他该归去的时候。满屋里便堆满了礼物。什么当归、红枣、皮蛋、湘绣。他全摇头。他弟弟试探着：
    “哥：你想带点什么？”
    “茶。原茶。”
    他悠悠地说。他要带的是那浓浓的、酽酽的、苦涩中透着清甜的乡情。
