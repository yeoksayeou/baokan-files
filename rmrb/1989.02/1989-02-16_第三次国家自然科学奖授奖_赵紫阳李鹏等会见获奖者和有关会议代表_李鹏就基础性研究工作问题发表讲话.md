The third National Natural Science Award ceremony was held today. Although Xiao Gang did not win a first prize, the 37-year-old professor from East China Normal University was fortunate to be chosen as a representative of the award winners to speak at the ceremony. This indicates that China is actively encouraging and supporting young scientific and technological workers to join the ranks of basic and applied basic research.

Research shows that the age of 30 is one of the best periods for scientific research. However, among the 936 principal researchers of the 178 projects that won the third National Natural Science Award, those aged 46-55 accounted for half, while those under 35 numbered only 56. This situation has caused concern among some senior scientists. To address this, the state is taking measures such as advocating for the establishment of youth science funds and setting up postdoctoral research stations to select a group of young people with good qualities, strong sense of duty, talent, and dedication to science to strengthen the team of basic research workers.

The National Natural Science Award is primarily aimed at recognizing outstanding achievements in the field of natural sciences that elucidate natural phenomena, properties, or laws. The first award was given in 1956, and the second in 1982. According to Wu Heng, chairman of the award committee, starting from the fourth award, the selection will be held every two years, with no more than 50 items awarded each time.

Leaders such as Zhao Ziyang, Li Peng, Hu Qili, Tian Jiyun, Li Tieming, Zhou Guocheng, Yan Jici, Song Jian, Fang Yi, Qian Xuesen, and Qian Weichang met with the award winners and representatives attending the National Basic and Applied Basic Research Conference, and took a group photo. Li Peng, Hu Qili, Li Tieming, Song Jian, Fang Yi, Qian Xuesen, and Qian Weichang presented awards to the principal researchers of the 178 winning projects. After the meeting, Li Peng spoke on related issues concerning basic research work.

　　第三次国家自然科学奖授奖    
    赵紫阳李鹏等会见获奖者和有关会议代表    
    李鹏就基础性研究工作问题发表讲话
    本报北京２月１５日讯  记者陈祖甲报道：虽然肖刚获得的不是一等奖，但这位３７岁的华东师范大学教授却幸运地作为获奖者的代表在今天的第三次国家自然科学奖授奖大会上发了言。
    这表明了我国积极鼓励和支持年轻的科技工作者加入基础研究和应用基础研究的队伍。据研究，３０岁左右是科学研究的最佳年龄段之一。而获得第三次国家自然科学奖的１７８个项目的９３６位主要研究者中，４６—５５岁的科学家占了一半，３５岁以下的仅５６名。这种现状引起一些老科学家的关切和担忧。为此，国家正在采取措施，如提倡建立青年科学基金、办好博士后流动站等，以选拔一批素质好、事业心强、有才干、有献身精神的青年人充实基础性研究队伍。
    国家自然科学奖主要是为了表彰在自然科学领域内取得的阐明自然现象、特性或规律的优秀成果。第一次奖励在１９５６年，第二次在１９８２年。据奖励委员会主任武衡说，从第四次起，将每两年评选一次，每次奖励不超过５０项。
    赵紫阳、李鹏、胡启立、田纪云、李铁映、周谷城、严济慈、宋健、方毅、钱学森、钱伟长等领导同志会见了获奖者与出席全国基础研究和应用基础研究工作会议的代表，并照了相。李鹏、胡启立、李铁映、宋健、方毅、钱学森、钱伟长等为１７８个获奖项目的主要研究者授了奖。李鹏在会见后就基础性研究工作的有关问题讲了话。
