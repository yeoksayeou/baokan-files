The Yuzhou Supply and Marketing Cooperative Increases Transparency in Specialized Operations

The Yuzhou Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Henan Province has started from establishing and improving the specialized operation mechanism, relying on a systematic supervision network and strict discipline to ensure that specialized agricultural materials reach the hands of farmers.

After the State Council decided that fertilizers, agricultural films, and pesticides would be specially operated by the supply and marketing cooperatives, the leaders of the Yuzhou Supply and Marketing Cooperative deeply felt that whether the materials could truly reach the hands of farmers directly relates to whether the benefits given to farmers by the state can be realized. For this reason, starting from last November, they have been focusing on the establishment of specialized operation institutions. Following the principle of "reducing links and conveniencing farmers," the city established a specialized operation company based on the city's agricultural materials company, and the township supply and marketing cooperatives established specialized operation service departments, helping each village to set up specialized operation service stations.

To prevent materials from being intercepted or misappropriated in the circulation process, each level of specialized operation department has established and improved a strict self-discipline mechanism, formulated institutions and disciplines for honest operations. The grassroots specialized operation service departments have all set up supervision boxes and hired 650 volunteer supervisors from among commercial, price, and farmer personnel, regularly reporting the operational situation to them. Once any violations of discipline or price violations are found in the operation, they will be seriously investigated and dealt with. To increase the transparency of specialized operations and facilitate public supervision, the grassroots specialized operation departments have generally implemented the "three public" system of material quantity, standards, and prices in the operation, and publicly announced them. Recently, the more than 2,000 tons of reward fertilizers they operated were all sent to farmers through the specialized operation channels.

　　经营情况张榜公布　欢迎农民评短论长
    禹州供销社增加专营透明度
    本报讯  河南省禹州市供销社从建立健全专营机制入手，靠系统的监督网络和严格的纪律，确保专营农资能到农民手里。
    国务院决定对化肥、农膜和农药由供销社实行专营后，禹州市供销社领导深感物资能否真正送到农民手里，直接关系着国家给农民的利益能否兑现。为此，从去年１１月份开始，他们抓紧专营机构的建立工作。本着“减少环节，方便农民”的原则，市里以市农资公司为依托成立了专营公司，乡镇供销社成立了专营服务部，帮助各村设立了专营服务站。
    为防止物资在流通环节中被截留挪用，各级专营部门建立健全了严格的自我约束机制，制订了廉洁经营的制度和纪律。基层专营服务部都设立了监督箱，并从工商、物价人员和农民中聘请了６５０名义务监督员，经常向他们通报经营情况，一旦发现经营中有违纪违价现象，予以严肃查处。为提高专营的透明度，便于群众公开监督，基层专营部门在经营中普遍实行了物资数量、标准、价格“三公开”，张榜公布。最近，他们经营的２０００多吨奖励化肥，都按专营渠道送到了农民手里。
