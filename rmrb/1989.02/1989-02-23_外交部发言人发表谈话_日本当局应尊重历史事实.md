Foreign Ministry spokesperson issued a statement today saying that the aggression wars launched by Japanese militarism in the past had caused enormous disasters to the Chinese people and the people of various countries in Asia. Regarding that unfortunate history, we cannot tolerate anyone distorting or denying it.

He said, any act of blurring the nature of the war or shifting the war responsibility is against the principles and spirit of the Sino-Japanese Joint Communique and the Sino-Japanese Peace and Friendship Treaty, and will inevitably hurt the feelings of the Chinese people and the people of other war-affected countries in Asia. Ultimately, it will also be very detrimental to Japan itself. On this major principle issue, the Japanese authorities should take the correct attitude of respecting historical facts.

　　外交部发言人发表谈话
    日本当局应尊重历史事实
    新华社北京２月２２日电  外交部发言人今天发表谈话说，日本军国主义过去发动的侵略战争，给中国人民和亚洲各国人民造成了巨大灾难。对待那段不幸历史，我们不能容忍有人加以歪曲或否认。
    他说，任何模糊战争性质、推卸战争责任的言行都是违背中日联合声明和中日和平友好条约原则和精神的，也必将伤害中国和亚洲其他战争受害国人民的感情，归根到底对日本自身也是十分不利的。在这一重大原则问题上，日本当局理应采取尊重历史事实的正确态度。
