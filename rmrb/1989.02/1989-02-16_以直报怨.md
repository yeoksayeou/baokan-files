There was a troupe that went to perform in a village. They were asked to perform "White Gate Tower," or else they would not be allowed to leave. It turned out that a neighboring village with the surname Lü had a grudge against this village due to a past altercation that resulted in a death. Now, they wanted to use Lü Bu's head to settle old scores. Similar incidents occurred during the Qing Dynasty. The "Xiang Zu Penji" records that in a certain county, the Pan and Wu clans had a deep-seated grudge. During a temple fair performance, the Wu clan demanded that "Water Margin" be performed, wanting to kill Pan Jinlian with a knife. The Pan clan felt that this not only defamed their ancestral aunt but also openly insulted the entire Pan clan. Thus, they gathered a crowd to cause a disturbance and filed a lawsuit. Pan Jinlian was just a fictional character, a figment of the imagination, and Lü Bu, though a historical figure, lived in a different era and in a different place. Moreover, the beheading of Lü Bu and the killing of Pan Jinlian were just stage performances and did not constitute legal cases. Among people, especially between those who have grievances, most hope to not be the loser but to be the victor. However, the beheading and killing on stage do not harm the other party in the slightest, nor does the first party gain any actual benefit from it. It is purely a matter of spiritual victory. The pioneer of this kind of victory is Ah Q, who was grabbed by the queue and had his head banged against the wall four or five times. The pursuit of spiritual victory is still a mental tumor in the minds of some people today, acknowledging it as our ancestor, but forgetting that we are all descendants of the Yellow Emperor.

One village and one clan against another village and another clan, one family against another family, even between brothers and sisters-in-law, due to different circumstances and life contradictions, grievances can easily arise. But it has been said since ancient times that it is better to resolve grudges than to harbor them. Laozi said, "Repay grievances with kindness." If this standard is considered too high, then listen to Confucius. He said, "Do not dwell on past wrongs," and also, "Repay justice with justice, repay kindness with kindness." Justice means being upright. It means loving and hating, taking and discarding, with impartiality and without bias. The meaning is that when others have grievances against me, I should treat them with impartiality and without bias. Many of Confucius's words are not entirely suitable for modern times, but these two sentences can still be borrowed.

Extending this logic, in terms of national unity and state unity, is it not the same principle?

### “以直报怨”

　　“以直报怨”
    有个剧团下乡，被人请去，指定要演《白门楼》，否则就不准离村。原来邻居姓吕，和此村因械斗有过人命案，如今还要借吕布的头去报旧仇。这类事情清代也有，《香祖笔记》说，某县有潘、吴二姓，宿怨甚深，庙会演戏时吴姓叫演《水浒》戏，要刀杀潘金莲，潘姓认为这不但污辱了本家姑奶奶，且明目张胆骂了潘氏一族，于是聚众大哄，告起状来。潘金莲不过是小说中人，子虚乌有，吕布虽有其人，但年代已久，且天各一方。更何况斩吕杀潘，只是戏台上的事，在法律上构不成案件。人际之间，特别是交怨双方，大都希望自己不是败将，而是一个胜利者，但戏台上的斩和杀，对乙方并不损害一根毫毛，而甲方也不会因此得到些小实惠，纯属精神胜利范畴。创立这一胜利的祖师爷，是被揪住黄辫子，在墙壁上碰了四五个响头的阿Ｑ。追求精神胜利，至今仍是一些人脑海深处的赘瘤，认这是吾祖，偏偏忘了大家都是炎黄子孙。
    这一村一姓和那一村一姓，这一家和那一家，甚至兄弟婆媳之间，由于处境不同，生活矛盾等等，因而结下怨恨，也是常有的事。但古来就认为冤家宜解不宜结。《老子》说：“报怨以德。”如果认为这标准太高，那就听孔子的。他有“不念旧恶”之句，还说“以直报直，以德报德。”直，就是正直。即爱憎取舍，以至公无私。意思是说，别人有怨于我，我都以至公无私去对待他。孔子有许多话并不都合于现代时宜，但这两句还是可以借鉴的。
　　推而广之，在民族团结、国家统一上不也如同此理吗？
