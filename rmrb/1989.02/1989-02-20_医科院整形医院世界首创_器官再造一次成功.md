The Institute of Surgery of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences has achieved a world first by successfully performing a one-time reconstruction of organs, with a success rate of over 90%.

This hospital is capable of reconstructing ears, breasts, noses, penises, and vaginas. Abroad, such surgeries typically require three to four procedures over a period of one to two years. The Institute of Surgery has improved its techniques to ensure adequate blood supply during organ reconstruction, achieving one-time organ reconstruction that can be completed in just a few hours. The reconstructed organs not only have a lifelike appearance but also possess the corresponding functions, reaching an advanced level worldwide.
