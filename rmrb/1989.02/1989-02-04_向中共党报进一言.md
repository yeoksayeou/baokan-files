    A Word to the Communist Party's Newspaper
    National Committee Member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Wú Xiūpíng

    Editor's Note: The *People's Political Consultative Conference News* published an article titled "A Word to the Communist Party's Newspaper" on January 31. It is reprinted here. Our newspaper is currently exploring news reforms and hopes to gain understanding and support from all sides. We also welcome various criticisms and suggestions.

    On New Year's Day, the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference held a tea party. Comrade Zhao Ziyang, in his speech, said: "In our country, strengthening democratic construction requires the People's Congress system, the system of multi-party cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the Communist Party. These fundamental systems are historically formed and are the choice of the Chinese people. They should be further improved and certainly not weakened." The general secretary's remarks made me think of the news coverage of the national congresses of the various democratic parties in 1988.

    The national congresses of the various democratic parties are held every five years and are undoubtedly an important part of our political life. Moreover, last year's national congresses of the various democratic parties had distinct characteristics. For the first time since the founding of the nation, each party proposed a platform that is in line with China's national conditions and reflects the characteristics of the various democratic parties. This is an important development in China's patriotic united front and the system of multi-party cooperation under the leadership of the Communist Party. However, the news coverage of the national congresses of the various democratic parties, except for the *People's Political Consultative Conference News*, was very inadequate in other newspapers. Even the newly revised constitutions and platforms of the various democratic parties, as well as the lists of central committee members and standing committee members elected at the congresses, were not reported. This reminds us of the news coverage of the national congresses of the various democratic parties in 1983, when the coverage was relatively comprehensive. In addition to the constitutions and the lists of central committee members of the various democratic parties, many congress proceedings were also reported. Comparing the two periods, one can see that the system of multi-party cooperation under the leadership of the Communist Party has been developing in practice over the past five years, but the Communist Party's newspapers have not truly reflected this historical process, and there is even a tendency to reduce coverage in news reports.

    As far as I know, members of the various democratic parties have strongly reacted to this, generally believing that since the 13th National Congress of the Communist Party, the Party has repeatedly clearly stated that it will develop and improve the system of multi-party cooperation under the leadership of the Communist Party and regard this as "a very important issue in political system reform." However, newspapers have taken such a cold attitude towards the policies formulated by the Central Committee of the Communist Party. Comparing the two periods, one can see that the Central Committee of the Communist Party is "warming up," while newspaper propaganda is "cooling down." It is no wonder that many members of the democratic parties are dissatisfied with the newspapers' practice of using half or even a whole page to publish advertisements, while compressing the coverage of major activities of the democratic parties.

    Some people say that the Communist Party's newspapers should strengthen their coverage of the activities of the various democratic parties, which would be beneficial to improving the system of multi-party cooperation under the leadership of the Communist Party and China's political system reform. It would also add to the glory of the Communist Party of China and demonstrate a sincere attitude towards multi-party cooperation. Why wouldn't the responsible persons of the Communist Party's newspapers be happy to do this?

### 向中共党报进一言

　　向中共党报进一言
    全国政协常委　　吴修平
    编者按：《人民政协报》１月３１日发表了题为《向中共党报进一言》的署名文章，现转载于此。本报正在进行新闻改革的探索，希望得到各方面的理解和支持，同时欢迎向我们提出各种批评和建议。
    今年元旦，全国政协举行茶话会时，赵紫阳同志在祝词中说：“在我国，加强民主建设，要靠人民代表大会制、共产党领导下的多党合作制和政治协商制。这些根本制度，是历史形成的，是中国人民的选择，应当进一步完善，而决不能削弱。”总书记的这一段话，使我联想到１９８８年各民主党派举行全国代表大会的新闻报道问题。
    各民主党派全国代表大会五年一次，应该说这是我国政治生活中不容忽视的事情。而且去年各民主党派全国代表大会具有鲜明的特色，是建国以来第一次各自提出了符合我国国情而又能体现各民主党派特点的纲领，这是我国爱国统一战线和共产党领导下的多党合作制度的重要发展。但是对各民主党派全国代表大会的新闻报道，除了《人民政协报》外，其他各报的报道是很不充分的，连各民主党派新制定的章程、纲领，以及大会选举产生的中央委员、常委的名单都不作报道。这又使人们想到１９８３年各民主党派代表大会时的新闻报道，那时的报道还是比较充分的，除了各民主党派的章程和中央委员会组成人员名单以外，还报道了不少大会的情况。前后对比，使人想到五年来共产党领导下的多党合作制度正在实践中得到发展，而中共的党报在这方面却没有真实地反映这个历史进程，而且在新闻报道上有日趋减弱之势。
    据我所知，各民主党派成员对此反映十分强烈，普遍认为中共自十三大以来多次明确宣告要发展与完善共产党领导下的多党合作制度，并以此作为“政治体制改革中的一个非常重要的问题”。而报纸对中共中央制定的方针却采取如此冷漠的态度，前后对比可以看出，中共中央在“加温”，报纸宣传在“降温”，无怪乎许多民主党派成员对报纸可以用大半版或整版刊登广告，而对民主党派的重大活动的报道却采取压缩的做法十分不满。
    有人说，中共的党报加强对各民主党派活动的报道，对完善共产党领导下的多党合作制度和我国政治体制改革大有好处，而且更能增添中国共产党的光采，并体现对多党合作的真诚态度。中共党报的负责人对此何乐而不为？
