Judge Wang Mingshan of the Bo County People's Court's Enforcement Division was found guilty of bribery and misconduct and has been expelled from the Communist Party. In January of this year, the Bo County People's Congress Standing Committee revoked his position. In September of last year, Wang Mingshan accepted bribes totaling over 2,000 yuan from the relatives of two criminals, promising to help them evade punishment during the trial. This incident was quickly exposed. The Bo County People's Procuratorate investigated the case and determined that Wang Mingshan's actions constituted the crime of accepting bribes. Given his confession and cooperation, as well as his return of the bribe money, the procuratorate decided to drop the charges against him.

　　法官王明山贪赃枉法
    受到开除党籍撤职处分
    新华社济南２月２４日电  （记者袁文忠、通讯员关升英）山东省博兴县法院执行庭庭长王明山贪赃枉法，被开除党籍。今年１月，博兴县人大常委会撤销了他的职务。去年９月，王明山收受两名犯罪分子家属的贿金２０００多元，答应在审理案件时为那两名犯罪分子开脱。这件事很快即被人揭发。县人民检察院立案侦查，认定王明山的行为已构成受贿罪，鉴于他认罪服法，退赃积极，决定免予起诉。
