It is said that during the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, a ruler who had achieved great success and desired eternal life placed four golden turtles under his bed. Twenty years later, he still passed away. When his descendants moved the bed, the four golden turtles stuck out their necks, looked around, and slowly crawled away.

Since then, the golden turtle has gained a great reputation, even being listed as the top among the more than 2,000 species of turtles in the world. It is not only a symbol of longevity but also a high-grade tonic. In recent years, scientists have extracted various substances from it, showing significant effects in cancer treatment. For a time, the market price of golden turtles soared, becoming a popular item for breeding. Unfortunately, this rare creature can only be raised in the south. However, Sun Rongwu, a fish farming specialist and retired soldier from Dashun Village, Fengnan County, Hebei Province, overcame numerous difficulties and successfully raised golden turtles in the north.

In April 1987, Sun Rongwu attended a training class on the artificial breeding technology of golden turtles organized by the Nanning Municipal Science and Technology Association. Soon after, he returned home with a box containing 40 golden turtles.

Everything is difficult at the beginning. Like all innovators and pioneers, Sun Rongwu's process of raising golden turtles was full of risks. Even experts from the provincial and municipal aquaculture research institutes said that there was no precedent for raising golden turtles in the north when they saw this rare animal.

Sun Rongwu was determined to open a new path to prosperity for the countryside and decided to achieve the great cause of migrating southern turtles to the north. At first, due to a lack of breeding experience, one small golden turtle died in the first month. Sun Rongwu was deeply regretful. He picked up the turtle buried in the sand and examined it repeatedly, recalling the common symptoms mentioned by his teacher, and determined that it died from abdominal shell rot. He found that the water in the pond where the dead turtle was found was murky, so he promptly changed the water and disinfected it every other day. He also bought sulfuric acid copper and gold mycetin from Tangshan, washed each golden turtle clean, applied medicine, and dried them in the sun, caring for them like patients. The abdominal shell rot was finally stopped.

To understand the living habits of the turtles, Sun Rongwu often squatted down to observe them quietly for a whole day. Once, he saw a turtle fighting with a snake. The snake coiled around the turtle three or four times, staring at the turtle's head that had retreated into its shell. The golden turtle stood on its hind legs, suddenly flipped over, and dove into the water. The snake then used its tail to strike the turtle's shell. After that, Sun Rongwu paid special attention to preventing snake attacks.

The weather is unpredictable. In late August of the previous year, a heavy rain of 250 millimeters caused the turtle ponds to overflow, washing away 27 golden turtles. Sun Rongwu was extremely anxious and sad, shedding tears. He quickly wrote an advertisement: "Whoever returns a golden turtle will be rewarded with 10 to 20 yuan," and posted it in counties and districts within a 20-kilometer radius. His sincerity moved the local people, and finally, 15 turtles were returned. Before winter, a few even crawled back on their own.

Sun Rongwu was obsessed with raising golden turtles. Even when he went out to buy materials and medicines, he would talk to people about the value and breeding techniques of golden turtles. Once, he dressed up, ready to visit his daughter's maternal grandmother's home for the New Year, but as soon as he arrived at the station, he was surrounded by people. They asked him questions and discussed the value and breeding techniques of golden turtles. As a result, he missed the bus and had to return home.

The overwintering of golden turtles is a big problem. Starting in November, golden turtles enter a hibernation state. Sun Rongwu placed them in baskets, with electric blankets for warmth at the bottom and plastic sheets in the middle. In this way, the 27 little creatures spent the winter safely.

Last year, they invested 500,000 yuan to build two hatching rooms, two water-drying pools, 15 modern turtle ponds, and 6 bullfrog ponds. The intelligent and diligent Sun Rongwu designed an advanced turtle pond with a deep middle, raised ends, and a resting platform through practice, and connected it with the water-drying pool, maintaining both water temperature and cleanliness. Now, the 27 golden turtles have grown from the original 190 grams to over 590 grams, laying 65 eggs. Sun Rongwu also compiled practical technical materials for raising golden turtles in the north.

This is truly a case of perseverance paying off: the southern turtles have successfully migrated north.

　　金钱龟北移记
    董建东　刘占玉
    相传春秋战国时代，一位功成业就、欲长生不老的君主在床脚下垫了四只金钱龟。２０年以后，他还是长逝了。当他的子孙们搬开床时，那四只金钱龟伸出脖子，左右看看，悠悠然爬走了。　　
    自此，金钱龟声誉大振，以至列于世界２０００多种龟科之首。它不但成为长寿之物，而且是高级滋补品。近年来，科学家又从中提炼出多种物质，对癌症疗效明显。一时间，金钱龟市场价格大涨，成为人们养殖的热门货。可惜，这种稀珍之物只能在南方饲养。然而，河北省丰南县大孙庄养鱼专业户、退伍军人孙荣武历尽艰险，在北方养殖成功。
    １９８７年４月，孙荣武慕名参加南宁市科协金钱龟人工养殖技术培训班。不久，抱着盛有４０只金钱龟的纸箱子回了家。
    万事开头难。正如世上所有搞发明、创造的开拓者一样，孙荣武养金钱龟的过程充满风险。看到这一珍稀动物，连省、市水产研究所的权威人士都说，北方养殖金钱龟尚无前例。
    孙荣武抱定为农村致富闯新路的信念，决心成就南龟北移的大事业。开始，由于缺乏养殖经验，头一个月，就有一只小金钱龟死去。孙荣武惋惜万分，拿起钻在沙子里的金钱龟反复翻看，回忆老师讲课中提到的常见症，断定是因腹甲溃烂致死。他发现死龟的那个池子水浑，就及时换水，每隔一天消毒一次。他还从唐山买回硫酸铜、金霉素等药品，把金钱龟逐个刷洗干净，擦上药，放在阳光下晾晒，就像侍候病人一样。腹甲溃烂症终于制止了。
    孙荣武为掌握龟的生活习性，常常蹲下来静静观察，一看就是一天。一次，他发现龟和一条蛇打起架来，蛇把龟盘了三四圈，眼睛盯着缩入颈中的龟头；只见那金钱龟后肢直立，猛一折斤斗，翻入水中；蛇又用尾巴抽龟盖儿。此后，孙荣武十分注意防范蛇的袭击。
    天有不测风云。去年８月下旬，一场大雨下了２５０毫米，龟池泛滥，冲走２７只金钱龟。孙荣武焦急万分，伤心得落下眼泪。他赶忙写出“广告”：谁送回一只金钱龟，奖给１０至２０元钱，贴到方圆２０公里内的各县、区。他的诚心感动了众乡亲，终于送回１５只。入冬前，竟有几只又寻踪觅迹地爬了回来。
    孙荣武养殖金钱龟着了魔。就是外出买资料、药品，也逢人宣讲：养金钱龟大有前途。一次，他打点好装束，准备到孩子姥姥家拜年，可一到车站就被围住了。人们问这问那，攀谈金钱龟的价值和养殖技术。结果，班车过去都不知道，只好打道回府。
    金钱龟越冬是一大难题。从１１月开始，金钱龟就进入冬眠状态。孙荣武把它们放入笸箩里，下边用电褥子供暖，中间用塑料布隔开。就这样，２７只小东西安安稳稳过了一冬。
    去年，孙荣武他们又投资５万元，修建了两个孵化室、两个晾水池、１５个现代化龟池和６个牛蛙池。聪明好学的孙荣武通过实践，设计出中间深、两头翘、带休息炕的先进龟池，并和晾水池沟通，既能保持池水温度，又能保持水质清洁。现在，２７只金钱龟已从原来的１９０克长到５９０克以上，产卵６５枚。孙荣武还自编了北方养殖金钱龟实用技术资料。
    这真是：功夫不负有心人，南龟北移告成功。
