Modern Culture Enters the Homes of Farmers in Suzhou
“Cultural Diplomacy” Promotes Healthy Development of Rural Commodity Economy

Newspaper: Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, February 11

A series of paintings depicting the beauty of the female form in bikinis are now proudly displayed in the living rooms of some young farmer couples. This is what I saw when visiting farmer households in Zhushang Village, Zhangjiagang City.

Suzhou is a coastal region open to the outside world and a prosperous and economically developed area. Ten years of economic reform and opening up have brought about the enlightenment of the cultural thoughts of farmers in Suzhou. Dance parties, human body art, music cafes, and popular songs have become fashionable here. Half of the towns in Suzhou hold dance parties on weekends. A young farmer in Luoshe Town told me that now going to a dance hall is as common as going to a cinema to watch a movie, and it has become an indispensable part of adjusting the rhythm of life.

The influx of foreign culture has broadened the cultural horizons of farmers in Suzhou and liberated their cultural thoughts.

The liberation of cultural thoughts among farmers in Suzhou, in turn, has influenced the economy, promoting the prosperity and development of rural commodity production. The rural economy is now showing the charm of modern culture.

In the past, economic exchanges among some township enterprises in Suzhou often relied on feasting and gift-giving to build relationships. With the liberation of cultural thoughts, the thinking and methods of economic exchanges among entrepreneurs have become more "modernized." Some township enterprises in Zhangjiagang City organize farmer fashion show teams to promote their products in Shanghai, Beijing, and other places. Some enterprises in Kunshan County hold order-fair dances to invite businessmen to dance, enhance friendship, and promote trade. Some enterprises in Changshu bring art troupes to Shanghai for economic negotiations, using "cultural diplomacy" to develop horizontal economic cooperation. "Cultural friendship diplomacy" has become an indispensable part of economic exchanges for many enterprises in Suzhou today. It is reported that a tea dance held in Yangshe Town, Zhangjiagang City, resulted in two major deals. The pottery capital of Yixing, Dingxu Town, held a pottery art festival last year, where cultural activities were used to build friendships with businessmen and do business, signing a total of thirteen investment projects and exporting $6.37 million worth of pottery products. The manager of a township enterprise in Jiangyin City said, "Cultural diplomacy" is both noble and dignified, while material gifts only further stimulate people's desires, corrupting social morals. Nowadays, being a manager who cannot dance is somewhat "unacceptable" here.

The liberation of cultural thoughts is also reflected in the updating of commodity design ideas in rural areas. A batch of elegant, lively, and interesting "Western-style" commodities are constantly emerging. Some clothing factories in Zhangjiagang City, which have been producing Zhongshan suits for many years, now produce "bat-wing shirts," "Paris hats," and "fitness pants." Some furniture factories in Wuxian County have replaced the ancient and elegant carved beds with novel French and Czech-style beds and sofas. The famous sociologist Fei Xiaotong praised the Changshu City Art Clothing Factory, known as "clothing the world," for designing and producing the "Yanqiu" jacket, which once swept the markets of Shanghai and Beijing and was rated as a quality product by the Ministry of Commerce and the province. This factory relies on various fashionable colors and styles to sell a variety of jackets to more than twenty provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country.

### 现代文化进入苏南农家  “文化外交”促进农村商品经济健康发展

　　现代文化进入苏南农家    
    “文化外交”促进农村商品经济健康发展
    新华社南京二月十一日电（记者周振丰）一幅幅表现女性体态美的比基尼画，如今已堂堂正正地悬挂在一些青年农民夫妇的起居室内。这是记者在苏南张家港市闸上村访问农民家庭时见到的情景。
    苏南是我国沿海对外开放地带，又是经济发达和富庶的地区。十年经济上的改革开放，带来了苏南农民文化思想的开化。交谊舞、人体艺术画、音乐茶座、流行歌曲等在这里已成为时尚。苏州市有半数乡镇周末举办舞会。洛社镇的一位青年农民对记者说：他现在进舞厅跳舞就像进影剧院看电影一样，成为调节生活节奏的不可缺少的内容。
    外来文化的进入，使苏南农民的文化视野开阔了，文化思想解放了。
    苏南农民文化思想的解放，反过来又作用于经济，促进了农村商品生产的繁荣和发展，农村经济正显示出现代文化的风采。
    过去，苏南一些乡镇企业经济交往多半靠请吃和馈赠联络感情。文化思想的解放，企业家们经济交往的思路和方式显得更“现代化”了。张家港市有的乡镇企业组织农民时装表演队，到上海、北京等地推销自己的产品。昆山县有的企业开订货会“以舞为媒”，邀客商跳舞，增进友谊，促成贸易。常熟有的企业带文艺队到上海搞经济洽谈，“以文会友”，发展横向经济协作。“文化友谊外交”，已是当今苏南许多企业经济交往不可缺少的内容。据介绍，张家港市杨舍镇举办的一次茶座舞会，就与客商做成了两笔“大生意”。陶都宜兴丁蜀镇去年举办陶瓷艺术节，在文化活动中与客商增进友谊做生意，共草签了十三个投资项目，成交六百三十七万美元的陶瓷产品出口。江阴市的一家乡镇企业的厂长说，“文化外交”和物质馈赠相比，前者既高尚又体面，后者只能进一步勾起人们的贪欲之心，败坏了社会风气。如今当厂长不会跳舞，在这里已有些“吃不开”了。
    文化思想的解放还反映到农村商品设计思想的更新上。一批批潇洒活泼富有情趣的“洋派”商品不断面市，多年生产中山服的张家港市的一些服装厂，现在推出了“蝙蝠衫”、“巴黎帽”、“健美裤”等新潮衣帽。吴县的一些家具厂以法式、捷式新颖床椅、沙发取代了古朴的雕花大床。被著名社会学家费孝通誉为“衣被天下”的常熟市工艺服装厂，设计生产的“艳秋”茄克衫曾一时风靡上海、北京市场，被商业部和省评为优质产品。这个厂就是靠各种流行色调和款式，把多种多样的茄克衫倾销到全国二十多个省、市、自治区的。
