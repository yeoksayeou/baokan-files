    When a performance review form is placed in front of professional researchers at the Fuzhou Agricultural Science Institute who hold high-level technical positions, their expressions vary. This is because the form, which lists six review items including research achievements, published articles, academic activities, talent cultivation, research style, and rationalization suggestions, acts like a mirror, reflecting their performance over the past year and determining whether they still qualify for their current professional technical positions.

    Last year, Institute Director Liu Zhuzhu signed contracts with the first batch of 98 scientific and technical personnel who were appointed to high-level technical positions and established a performance review system. The reviewed personnel, according to the contract, must submit annual performance reports and fill in self-assessment scores on the review form. The scores are then evaluated by the public and the review committee, leading to a comprehensive evaluation and scoring. After the review, 39.3% of the total reviewed personnel were rated as good or fairly good, 48.2% were rated as average, and 12.5% were rated as poor.

    “I didn’t expect the review to be so thorough. Everyone is so concerned about it. During the review, some people blushed, and some people sweated. This is a good thing.”

    “Last year, although I achieved relatively good results, this year is still uncertain. I feel a lot of pressure.”

    “This review was like a whip to me…”

    Although the feelings of the scientific and technical personnel who underwent the review differed, there was one common point: being evaluated for a professional technical position and accepting the appointment does not mean sitting on an iron chair. If one's performance does not match the title, one must give up the "chair."

    After the review, the review committee and the directors of various research institutes had discussions with the reviewed personnel, honestly conveying the public's opinions and the review committee's scores and comments. For those with poor review results, specific directions for improvement were emphasized.

    “What if the person who failed the review this time still fails next time?”

    “Then we will definitely dismiss them!” Director Liu’s response was unequivocal.

　　福建农科院年度考核专业人员
    高级职称也非“铁交椅” 
    院长说：不合格的就坚决解聘
    本报福州２月２２日电  记者张铭清报道：当一张考核表放在福建农业科学院有高级技术职务的科研人员面前的时候，他们的表情是不一样的。因为这张开列着科研成绩、发表文章、学术活动、培养人才、科研作风、合理化建议６个考核项目的表格像一面镜子，映出他们过去一年的成绩，将决定他们是否还具备现有专业技术职务的资格。
    去年，该院院长刘中柱与首批聘任高级技术职务的９８位科技人员签订聘任合同，并建立聘任考核制度。被考核人员按合同，要作年度述职报告，并在考核表上填上自我评定的分数，由群众评议、考核小组考评，作出综合评价和评定分数。经考核，被评为好的和比较好的占总考核人数的３９．３％，一般的占４８．２％，差的占１２．５％。
    “没有想到考核会这样认真，大家对考核这么关心。考核时，有人脸红，有人冒汗。这是好事。”
    “去年，虽然取得了较好的成绩，但今年还是个未知数。我感到压力很大。”
    “这次考核像抽了我一鞭子……”
    考核结果不同的科技人员虽然感受不一，但有一点是共同的：评上专业技术职务，接受了聘任，并不是坐上了铁交椅。名实不符，就得把“椅子”交出来。
    考核结束后，考核小组和各研究所长找被考核人员谈了话，将群众评议的意见和考核组的评分和意见如实相告。对考核成绩差的，着重指出他们的具体方向。
    “要是这一次考核不合格的人，下一次还不合格，怎么办呢？”
    “那就坚决解聘！”刘院长的回答毫不含糊。
