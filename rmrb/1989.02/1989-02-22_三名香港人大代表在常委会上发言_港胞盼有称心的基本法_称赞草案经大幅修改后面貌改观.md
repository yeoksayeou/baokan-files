Three Hong Kong NPC deputies spoke at the Standing Committee meeting today, expressing their hopes for a satisfactory Basic Law. They praised the draft after it underwent significant revisions.

New China News Agency, Beijing, February 20th – (Reporter Zhang Mengyi) Hong Kong region NPC deputies attending the Sixth Session of the Seventh National People's Congress Standing Committee discussed the Basic Law draft today. They hope that the review of the Basic Law draft will facilitate communication and understanding between the mainland and Hong Kong.

	Wu Kangmin – Urgent Need to Understand Hong Kong People's Sentiments

Wu Kangmin said that Hong Kong compatriots hope for a Basic Law that guarantees they can continue to enjoy a prosperous and stable life. They have expectations, demands, concerns, and insufficient confidence towards Beijing. This is understandable. Therefore, he suggested that the Standing Committee, in addition to studying the draft articles, should also understand the sentiments and various reflections of Hong Kong compatriots.

Wu Kangmin believes that the current concerns and doubts of Hong Kong compatriots about the Basic Law are: fearing that after 1997, Hong Kong will shift from rule of law to rule by man; many middle-class individuals are striving to obtain foreign passports and residency rights for greater security; young people have high democratic aspirations and hope to have opportunities to showcase their talents in the future.

Wu Kangmin said that in the past, under British rule, the colonial politics in Hong Kong were only slightly open to representatives of the privileged classes, with young intellectuals having little say. With 1997 approaching, the nature of governance will change, and they should have the right to be masters of their own fate. The high democratic aspirations are understandable. Therefore, these issues should be addressed by leading them in the right direction and persuading them with reason, explaining the need for gradual progress in democracy while also adapting to the trend. Wu Kangmin believes that Hong Kong is still relatively prosperous and stable, but "in times of peace, think of danger," and one cannot ignore the destabilizing and destructive forces within Hong Kong society and external factors that could trigger instability. He said that Hong Kong society's ability to withstand disasters and adapt is fragile, and this weakness should be fully considered to further stabilize Hong Kong society as much as possible.

	Zheng Yaotang – Suggests Balancing Interests of All Levels

Zheng Yaotang said in his speech that the majority of Hong Kong residents support "one country, two systems." They deeply feel that only under the premise of sovereignty return can Hong Kong people truly enjoy a high degree of autonomy. At the same time, only a high degree of autonomy can guarantee the implementation of "one country, two systems." He said that the eighth meeting of the Basic Law Drafting Committee made significant revisions to the draft articles, greatly improving Hong Kong people's impression. He believes that as long as this attitude of valuing the differences between the two systems is maintained, Hong Kong people's doubts can be dispelled.

Zheng Yaotang said that continuing to maintain and promote Hong Kong's economic prosperity and social stability is the common wish and interest of Hong Kong people. The central government has done a lot for this. But he believes that to truly promote Hong Kong's stability and prosperity, in addition to the future economic system of Hong Kong continuing to maintain the basic operating advantages of the present to attract investors, it is also necessary to allow various strata of society to reasonably share the fruits of development. He said that Hong Kong, as a modern commercial and industrial society, derives its development momentum from the joint efforts of people from all walks of life, creating wealth. Without reasonable sharing, it is difficult to maintain harmonious cooperation and difficult to mobilize the enthusiasm of all strata. Therefore, he suggested that the Basic Law should reasonably balance the interests of all strata.

He said that Hong Kong can only develop in the direction of democracy, fully mobilizing the wisdom and talents of people from all walks of life, establishing a highly democratic and autonomous Hong Kong government. On the other hand, a mechanism should be gradually established to enable Hong Kong people to solve internal contradictions and various affairs through their own efforts and internal coordination. He also suggested including in the Basic Law the right of enterprises to collective bargaining and retirement benefits to establish good labor-management relations, promote business development, and contribute to social stability.

He suggested that in future consultations, openness and comprehensiveness should be maintained, and various forms and channels should be used to understand public opinion or conduct a public opinion poll.

	Liu Yaozhu – Mainland Stability Benefits Hong Kong

Liu Yaozhu said that the Standing Committee members analyzed the concerns and doubts of Hong Kong people in a reasonable and sensible manner during the discussion. This understanding of Hong Kong people's feelings, this understanding of Hong Kong's actual situation, and this careful and prudent approach to handling Hong Kong issues "moved me greatly and made me feel that the views of the mainland and Hong Kong are quite close."

She said that Hong Kong compatriots believe that the reform and opening up and political stability of the mainland are directly related to the success of "one country, two systems" and to maintaining Hong Kong's stability and prosperity.

　　三名香港人大代表在常委会上发言
    港胞盼有称心的基本法
    称赞草案经大幅修改后面貌改观
    新华社北京２月２０日电  （记者张孟仪）列席七届全国人大常委会六次会议的香港地区人大代表在今天的大会讨论中，就基本法草案发表了意见。他们希望通过基本法草案审议沟通内地和香港的了解。
    　　　　吴康民——亟应了解港人心态
    吴康民代表说，香港同胞希望有一部能保证照常享受繁荣安定生活的基本法，他们对北京有期望、有要求、有顾虑、有信心不足等心态。这是不足为怪的。为此，他建议人大常委会除了要研究草案条文外，要了解香港同胞的心态和各种反映。
    吴康民认为当前香港同胞对基本法的担心和疑虑是：害怕１９９７年后香港从法治变成人治；许多中产阶级为争取更大安全系数而力争获得外国护照和外国居留权；青年人民主呼声高，希望将来有一显身手的机会。
    吴康民说，过去香港在英国当局统治下，殖民地政治只是稍为对既得利益集团的代表人物开放，青年知识分子无太大发言权。１９９７年来临，政权性质改变，他们应有当家作主的权利，民主呼声高是可以理解的。因此，对这些问题应因势利导，以理服人，既讲清民主要循序渐进的道理，也要顺应潮流。吴康民认为，香港目前仍是相当繁荣安定的，但“居安思危”，不能不考虑到香港社会上存在不安定、破坏性的力量和有引发不安定的外部因素。他说，香港社会承受灾难和应变的能力是脆弱的，应充分估计香港社会的这一弱点，尽量做到有利于香港社会的进一步稳定。
    　　　　郑耀棠——建议兼顾各层利益
    郑耀棠代表在发言时说，大多数香港居民是拥护“一国两制”的，他们深深地感到，只有在主权回归的前提下，港人才有机会真正享有高度的自治的权利。同时也只有高度的自治，才能保证“一国两制”的实现。他说，第八次基本法起草委员会议对草案条文作大幅度修改，使港人印象大为改观。他认为只要继续坚持这种重视两制差异的态度，是可以消除港人的疑虑的。
    郑耀棠说，继续维持和促进香港经济的繁荣和社会稳定是港人共同愿望和共同利益，中央也为此作了不少事情。但他认为，要真正促进香港的稳定繁荣，除了香港未来的经济制度应尽可能继续维持现时基本运作的优点，以吸引投资者外，还应让社会各阶层合理地分享发展的成果。他说，香港这个现代的工商业社会，其发展的动力是源于各阶层人士的通力合作，才能创造出财富。如果没有合理分享，难以保持和谐的合作，难以发挥各阶层的积极性。为此，他建议基本法应兼顾到合理平衡各阶层的利益。
    他说，香港只有朝着民主方向发展，才能充分发挥各阶层人士的聪明才智，建立一个高度民主的自治的港人政府，而另一方面要逐步建立一种机制，使港人能透过自己的力量，以内部协调的办法，解决内部矛盾和各种事务。他还建议在基本法中列明企业有集体谈判权和退休保障福利，以建立起良好的劳资关系，以促进事务发展，有利于社会稳定。
    他建议在今后咨询中要维持开放性和全面性，通过多种形式和渠道了解民意或进行一次民意调查。
    　　　　廖瑶珠——内地稳定有利香港
    廖瑶珠代表说，人大常委会委员在讨论过程中对港人的担心和疑虑作了合情合理的分析。这种对港人心情的体会，对香港现实处境的了解，对处理香港问题的虚心和慎重，都“使我十分感动，使我感到内地和香港的观点相当接近。”
    她说，香港同胞相信，内地的改革开放和政治稳定，对“一国两制”的成功，对保持香港的稳定繁荣有直接关系。
