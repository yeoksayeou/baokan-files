The White Shock

China, a country rich in salt resources, why did a severe "salt shortage" occur in 1988? To understand the situation, read: The White Shock

Reporter Liu Xiao

No one expected that there would be a "salt shortage" in 1988.

Salt, spanning both national economy and people's livelihood, is an essential commodity for both daily life and industrial production. Its scarcity inevitably leads to serious consequences.

Society's demand for salt exceeded the available supply, leaving a significant gap...

The 1988 "salt shortage" was, in fact, a cumulative explosion.

The accumulation over the past five years had reached a critical point, and the quantity had exceeded the limit.

The national salt market at the beginning of the Dragon Year was already in a precarious state.

The annual allocation plan itself contained risks: the total salt demand for the year was 21.5 million tons, but the available supply was only 18 million tons, leaving a deficit of 3.5 million tons, the largest in the history of the country.

Food salt for civilian use must be guaranteed, with an average annual consumption of about 7 kilograms per person, plus salt for pickling, totaling 7.54 million tons.

The demand for industrial salt is large, with the state-designated chemical plants requiring 12 million tons of industrial salt, but only 9.46 million tons could be supplied, which is 78.8% of the demand. Some provinces and cities have only 60% or more. As for the industrial salt for non-designated plants and the salt used in food processing, agriculture, animal husbandry, and fisheries totaling over 200 million tons, it was basically not included in the plan.

To alleviate the contradiction and fill the gap, decision-makers placed their hopes on inventory and increased production.

First, let's look at the inventory. Since 1983, China's salt market has seen five consecutive years of sales exceeding production, consuming a total of 10 million tons of inventory. The inventory in various regions has dropped below the warning line, making it difficult to adjust supply and demand and respond to sudden changes.

Next, let's look at increased production. China's salt fields are mainly sea salt, accounting for 70% of the total production. Sea salt is affected by the climate, with unpredictable yields, relying on the weather. Additionally, the transportation of increased salt from production areas to sales areas faces a sharp contradiction of insufficient transportation capacity.

However, it was precisely in this year that a series of "panic buying" incidents occurred, each affecting the salt market. At the same time, hungry industrial enterprises also swarmed into the salt market. Industrial salt competed with civilian salt, further exacerbating the contradiction.

People cannot live without salt. Farmers in Zhejiang claimed, "No salt, no tax payment"; residents in a county in Anhui threw the county government's sign on the ground; the Nanjing municipal government received 109 calls of questioning and criticism in one day...

The advantage of abundant salt resources was no longer visible, and the shortage of salt brought a series of problems.

The salt shortage alarmed thousands of households, various levels of government, and departments.

Almost all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions held emergency meetings for salt and dispatched batches of elite troops to the production areas to secure salt. Places like Qinghai, Inner Mongolia, and Xinjiang, which are usually sparsely populated, were filled with representatives from the sales areas. In the heart of the Ulan Buh Desert, the Jilantai salt field alone had more than a hundred people. The urgent transportation of salt put unprecedented pressure on the already overloaded railways, highways, inland rivers, and coastal rivers. The byproducts of a shortage economy—hoarding, speculation, blending, price increases, selling to large buyers, and selling freight cars—added to social instability.

Ordinary people found it hard to understand.

The mood among salt industry officials was extremely heavy.

China's sea salt, lake salt, and mine salt resources are abundant and evenly distributed. The proven geological reserves of mine salt in Southwest, Northeast, North China, and East China amount to 47 billion tons; the "salt lake belt" stretching across the vast Northwest regions has a geological reserve of 200 billion tons of lake salt; China's coastline stretches for thousands of miles. The vast ocean is a natural reservoir for sea salt. Geological experts describe it as: "Like having the water of the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers to drink alone. For China, salt resources will never be a problem."

However, why did such a resource-rich salt-producing country face such a severe "salt shortage"?

In 1986, industrial salt consumption surpassed civilian salt for the first time, and its constraint on the national economy became increasingly significant, but its position in industrial policy became increasingly low.

Salt, as an indispensable commodity for daily life, has a high "political sensitivity," and as a raw material for caustic soda, soda ash, and other industries, it also has a high "economic sensitivity." A shortage of salt affects the production of caustic soda, and a shortage of caustic soda affects numerous industries such as chemical, light, textile, metallurgy, and building materials. Two caustic soda plants in Shanghai are in danger, affecting one-third of the city's industrial enterprises.

Experts calculated the following: the ex-factory price of one million tons of raw salt is 5.7 million yuan, but the multiplier effect generated is 6 billion yuan in developed regions and 4 billion yuan in underdeveloped regions.

In the early days of the country's founding, industrial salt accounted for 6% of the total salt sales, which increased to 51% in 1986, surpassing civilian salt for the first time. What is puzzling is that as salt entered the industrial raw material field from the purely civilian field, its constraint on the national economy became increasingly significant, but its position in industrial policy became increasingly low.

China has long been short of two types of soda, spending hundreds of millions of dollars each year to import them from abroad. During the "Seventh Five-Year Plan," the state invested in building three large soda plants with an annual capacity of 600,000 tons each in Hebei, Shandong, and Jiangsu, and ten medium-sized soda plants with an annual capacity of 100,000 to 200,000 tons each. Various localities also started dozens of small soda plants with capacities of 20,000 to 30,000 tons each. The state's focus on developing the soda industry is understandable, but can the base material, salt, not be developed?

However, over the past decade, the state's investment in the salt industry has been very limited. During the "Sixth Five-Year Plan," due to the abundant production of sea salt, which led to a temporary difficulty in selling salt, the decision-making department developed a misconception and adopted a "production restriction" policy, with almost no investment over five years. The area of salt fields shrank, and a large number of salt workers were transferred to other jobs. In the last two years, the country began to dig into its inventory nationwide. To reverse the passive situation, the "Seventh Five-Year Plan" planned to invest 1.37 billion yuan to increase the production capacity of 6 million tons of raw salt, but only 500 million yuan has been realized so far. Originally, the development of the salt industry should be somewhat ahead of the soda industry, but now it is far behind.

Currently, the tight salt supply has led to a severe shortage of intermediate products, two types of soda. The price per ton of pure soda ash increased from 560 yuan last year to 1,380 yuan in 1988; the price per ton of pure soda increased from 800 yuan to 2,700 yuan. The soaring prices of two types of soda have caused the prices of fertilizers, pesticides, resins, paper, soap, glass, dyeing, textiles, and all final products to rise, becoming one of the factors of inflation. The market has demand, and soda plants have idle capacity, which in turn competes for salt sources, forming a strong impact on the salt market.

It seems that after the "salt shortage," it is necessary to re-examine our industrial policies.

High taxes and low prices are like two mountains, pressing down on salt-producing enterprises, making people wonder if the old model of "salt and iron" should still be adhered to in today's commodity economy.

For a long time, salt has been regarded as a "political commodity" and a "welfare commodity," with the lower the price, the better, becoming a symbol of socialist superiority. Since the liberation, especially in the past few years after the price reform, all commodities have risen in price, but only the price of salt has been adjusted down five times, remaining at the bottom. Now, the ex-factory price of one jin of sea salt is 2.8 fen, not as valuable as a jin of straw or a bowl of tea water. Salt workers in Guangdong jokingly say: "Making salt is not as good as drinking cold water and urinating." Because a basket of salt is worth 2.10 yuan, while a basket of urine is worth 2.30 yuan.

On one hand, the price of salt is suppressed, and on the other hand, salt is heavily taxed. Since the founding of the country, with the rise of new industries, the proportion of salt tax in the state's financial revenue has decreased from 4.13% in the early days of liberation to 0.32% in the 1980s. The state has successively significantly reduced the tax rates on sugar, cotton, oil, and hemp, which are essential commodities for daily life, but for salt, it has adhered to the principle of "salt and iron," still collecting special taxes. In 1985, Huabei Salt Field paid 91.97 million yuan in salt tax to the state, with a total profit of only 6.13 million yuan, with tax being more than 15 times the profit.

High taxes and low prices are like two mountains, pressing down on salt-producing enterprises, making them gasp for breath. To avoid wearing the hat of loss, they have to repeatedly reduce production costs. The cost of sea salt nationwide has been distorted for decades, and many necessary expenses have not been raised. Salt fields, as the main equipment for sea salt production, have not had major repair and depreciation costs raised, and old salt fields like Baijia Dian and Banjie Dian have not been renovated, while new salt fields have serious leakage problems, with the completeness rate of salt fields nationwide only 45%. Power equipment is aging, and many salt fields' electric motors and other equipment have been overused for many years, operating with faults. The spider-web-like salt transportation rivers inside the salt fields are in disrepair. The losses in the salt industry, coupled with the stark contrast between low salt prices and high soda prices, have severely dampened the enthusiasm of salt industry workers.

Now the salt market has stabilized, and the state and various localities have taken measures to ensure the supply of salt for residents. However, the fundamental way to prevent "salt shortages" is to adopt effective preferential policies to support salt production. Currently, the rectification and adjustment of the economic environment is also a good time to make adjustments.

Of course, to maintain the basic stability of prices, the current measures should focus on adjusting the distribution of interests between the salt industry and the chemical industry.

The reporter noticed that the People's Bank of China announced on January 21 that, starting from February 1, 1989, the adjustment of deposit and loan interest rates has included the salt industry in the implementation of differential interest rates, giving it appropriate consideration.

　　白色的冲击

    中国，一个盐资源极为丰富的大国，为什么出现
    一九八八年的严重“盐荒”？欲知究竟，请读——白色的冲击
    本报记者　刘霄
    谁也没有想到，１９８８年会发生“盐荒”。
    食盐，横跨国计、民生两大领域，既是重要的生活资料，又是重要的生产资料。它的短缺，必然造成严重后果。
      社会用盐超过可供量，留下一个大缺口……
    １９８８年的“盐荒”，实际上是一次总爆发。
    近５年来的积累，量变终于超过了“度”。
    龙年开首的全国原盐市场，已是险象环生。
    年度分配计划本身就潜伏着危机：当年全社会用盐２１５０万吨，可供量１８００万吨，缺口３５０万吨，为建国以来所没有。
    民用食盐必须确保，人均年消费食盐约７公斤，加上腌菜用盐，共需７５４万吨。
    工业用盐需求量大，国家定点化工厂的工业用盐需要量１２００万吨，只能满足９４６万吨，占７８．８％，部分省市甚至只有６０％多。至于非定点厂的工业用盐和食品加工、农牧渔用盐２００多万吨，基本未能列入计划。
    为了缓解矛盾，堵住缺口，决策者把希望寄托在库存和增产两个方面。
    先看库存。１９８３年起，我国原盐市场连续５年销大于产，先后吃掉库存１０００万吨。各地库存量均降至警戒线下，难调节供求，应付突变。
    再看增产。我国盐滩以海盐为主，占总产量的７０％。海盐受气候影响，丰欠不定，靠天吃饭。此外，增产的原盐从产区调往销区，还面临着运力不足的尖锐矛盾。
    然而恰恰就在这一年，连续而起的“抢购风”，每一次都波及到食盐。与此同时，不甘饥饿的工业企业也蜂拥到食盐市场。工业盐反冲民用盐，进一步激化了矛盾。
    民不可无盐。浙江农民声称“不见咸盐不交公粮”；安徽某县群众把县政府的牌子扔在地上；南京市政府一天接到１０９个质问责骂的电话……
    　 盐资源丰富的优势看不到了，盐的短缺带来了一系列问题
    盐荒，惊动了千家万户、各级政府和各个部门。
    几乎所有的省市自治区都为盐召开过紧急会议，并派出一批又一批精兵强将，前往产区要盐。一向人迹稀少的青海、内蒙古、新疆的湖盐盐场住满了销区代表，仅乌兰布和大沙漠腹地的吉兰泰一个盐场，就聚集了上百人之多。盐的紧急调运给本已超载的铁路、公路、内河、外河带来空前的压力。短缺经济的伴生物——惜售、倒卖、搭配、涨价、卖大户、卖车皮等如鬼附身，增加了社会的不安定因素。
    老百姓感到不好理解。
    盐业部门的同志心情极为沉重。
    我国海盐、湖盐和井矿盐资源丰富且分布均匀。西南、东北、华北、华东已探明的井矿盐地质储量达４．７万亿吨；横贯西北广大地区有盛产湖盐的“盐湖带”，地质储量２０００亿吨；我国海岸绵延万里。浩荡的大洋便是海盐的天然贮库。地矿专家们形容说：“就像长江黄河的水只给我一人喝一样。对我国来说，盐的资源永远也不会成为问题。”
    可是，我们这样一个资源丰富的盐业大国，为什么竟会酿成如此严重的“盐荒”？
    　　１９８６年工业用盐首次超过民用盐，对国民经济制约力
    越来越大，但盐业在产业政策中的地位越来越低
    盐，作为不可缺少的生活资料，有极高的“政治敏感度”，作为烧碱、纯碱和其它工业的重要原料，又具有极高的“经济敏感度”。盐少危及碱，碱少又危及化工、轻工、纺织、冶金、建材众多工业部门。上海两个烧碱厂告急，就危及全市１／３的工业企业。
    专家们算了一笔帐：一万吨原盐出厂价５７万元，但是所产生的乘数效益，发达地区可达６个亿，不发达地区也可达到４个亿。
    建国初期，我国工业用盐在原盐总销量中所占的比重为６％，１９８６年上升到５１％，首次超过了民用盐。令人不好理解的是，随着盐从单纯的民生领域进入工业原料领域，对国民经济的制约力越来越大，可在产业政策中的地位却越来越低。
    我国两碱长期紧缺，每年都要花费数亿美元从国外进口。“七五”期间国家投资，在河北、山东、江苏新建了３个年产６０万吨的大碱厂，１０个年产１０万至２０万吨的中型碱厂，各地还上马了二三十个２万至３万的小碱厂。国家重点发展制碱工业无可非议，问题在于，作为基础原料的盐不上能行吗？
    然而，近１０年来国家对盐业投入却很少。“六五”期间，由于海盐丰产导致一时的卖盐难，使决策部门产生错觉，对盐业采取了“限产”政策，五年当中基本没有投入。盐田面积萎缩，盐工大量转业，后两年即开始全国范围挖库存。为了扭转被动局面，“七五”期间计划投资１３．７亿元，以增加６００万吨原盐的生产能力，至今只落实了５亿多元。本来，盐业的发展应适当超前于制碱工业，现在却大大滞后了。
    目前盐源紧张，导致中间产品两碱奇缺。每吨纯碱的价格从前年的５６０元，涨到１９８８年的１３８０元；纯碱的价格每吨从８００元涨到２７００元。两碱飞涨，造成了化肥、农药、树脂、造纸、肥皂、玻璃、印染、纺织等所有最终产品的价格上涨，成为通货膨胀的因素之一。市场有需求，碱厂又有闲置能力，反过来争盐源，对食盐市场形成强烈冲击。
    看来，“盐荒”之后，很有必要重新审视我们的产业政策了。
    高税低价像两座大山，压得制盐企业喘不过气来，人们问，在商品经济的今天，是否还要坚持“盐铁论”的老模式
    长期以来，盐被视作“政治商品”和“福利商品”，价格越低越好，成了社会主义优越性的一个标志。解放以来特别是近几年价格改革以后，所有的商品都涨了，只有食盐却５次下调价格，压在价格的谷底。现在，一斤海盐出厂价２分８厘，不如一斤稻草，一碗茶水。广东盐工戏言：“晒盐不如喝凉水撒尿”。因为一担盐价２．１０元，而一担尿值２．３０元。
    一方面盐价压得很苦，一方面盐又被课以高税重赋。建国后，随着新兴工业的崛起，盐税在国家财政收入中的比重由解放初期的４．１３％下降到８０年代的０．３２％。国家对糖、棉、油、麻等生活必需品先后大幅度调低税额，而对盐，却恪守着“盐铁论”的宗旨，仍然收取特种税。１９８５年，淮北盐场向国家交纳盐税９１９７万元，留利总额仅６１３万元，税是利的１５倍以上。
    高税低价像两座大山，压得制盐企业喘不过气来。为了不戴亏损帽子，只得一再压缩生产成本，全国海盐成本几十年失真，很多该提的费用没有提。盐滩作为海盐生产的主要设备，一直不提大修理费和折旧费，老的八卦滩、半截滩得不到改造，新铺的滩田渗漏严重，全国盐田完好率仅及４５％。动力设备老化，很多盐场的电动机等，超役多年，带病运转。盐场内蛛网一样的运盐河年久失修。盐业的亏损，再加上低盐价和高碱价的鲜明对照，严重挫伤了盐业职工的积极性。
    现在食盐市场已经趋于稳定，国家和各地方已采取措施确保居民食盐供应。但杜绝“盐荒”的根本办法，是必须采取有力的倾斜政策，扶持盐业生产。目前治理整顿经济环境，也正是做出调整的好时机。
    当然，为了物价的基本稳定，目前采取的措施，应着重从调整盐业和化工业之间的利益分配上加以考虑。
    记者注意到，中国人民银行１月２１日宣布，从１９８９年２月１日调整存贷款利率时，已经把盐业列入了实行差别利率的行业，给予适当照顾。
