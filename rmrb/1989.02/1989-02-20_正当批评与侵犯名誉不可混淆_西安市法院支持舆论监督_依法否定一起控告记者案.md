	Legitimate Criticism and Defamation Must Not Be Confused
	Xi'an Court Supports Public Opinion Supervision
	Legally Dismisses a Case Against a Journalist

	Xi'an, Feb. 19 (Xinhua) — “Our judicial department should actively support news media supervision and protect the legitimate rights of journalists. We should not let journalists who write critical reports be busy with lawsuits, affecting their reporting work.”

	Recently, Li Bin, president of the Xi'an Intermediate People's Court, expressed the above views in an interview with reporters regarding a case in which a journalist was sued for defamation by the New City District Court. He also announced the court's opinions and measures for handling cases involving news organizations accused of defamation.

	On March 6 and 7 last year, the People's Daily and the Shaanxi Daily published a report titled “Two Strange Incidents in One Day at the Zhongnan Town Police Station in Zhouzhi County: The Reporter is Detained and the Thief is Scolded,” criticizing the wrongdoings of some police officers in Zhongnan Town for their rough treatment of reporting citizens. During the investigation, the reporter, together with the victims, went to the police station to verify the facts. The relevant personnel at the police station also made a self-criticism at a meeting of all officers and apologized to the victimized farmers. However, after the critical report was published, the person involved claimed that the newspaper's criticism was “distorting facts” and “seriously inaccurate,” and sued the reporter for defamation. The New City District Court accepted the case, and the reporter frequently received summonses.

	After the Xi'an Municipal Political and Legal Committee investigated the relevant circumstances, it requested the Intermediate People's Court to handle the case properly according to law. The Intermediate People's Court, together with the New City District Court, analyzed and studied the case and believed that the plaintiff's claim did not constitute defamation. On February 1, after the New City District Court mediated and persuaded, the plaintiff applied to withdraw the lawsuit.

	On February 15, the Xi'an Intermediate People's Court put forward five opinions and measures to support public opinion supervision, protect the legitimate rights of journalists and citizens, and carefully handle cases involving news organizations accused of defamation. These include: before accepting a case, the court should carefully examine it, emphasizing the plaintiff's evidence while also paying attention to the opinions of the news organization; for disputes involving news organizations accused of defamation that are being investigated and handled by relevant departments, the court generally will not accept the case; it is necessary to strictly distinguish between legitimate public opinion criticism and defamation. For cases where work errors and inadequate investigations lead to inaccurate reports causing harm to the parties involved, the issue can be resolved through consultation between the two sides, with the news organization providing clarification and correction. For legitimate public opinion supervision by news organizations, firm support should be given; for cases with evidence constituting defamation, or for those using news media supervision to deliberately insult and defame others, with serious circumstances constituting the crime of insult and defamation, the court will accept the case and handle it according to law. However, this must be strictly measured by its constituent elements and handled with caution.

　　正当批评与侵犯名誉不可混淆
    西安市法院支持舆论监督       
    依法否定一起控告记者案
    本报西安２月１９日电  本报记者孟西安、新华社记者华年轮报道：“我们司法部门要积极支持新闻舆论监督，保护记者的合法权益，不要让写批评报道的记者忙于打官司，影响报道工作”。
    日前，西安市中级人民法院院长李彬在接受记者采访时，就西安市新城区法院受理的一起控告记者侵犯名誉权案谈了上述看法，并宣布了市中级人民法院关于收受审理诉新闻单位侵犯名誉权案件的几点意见和措施。
    去年３月６日、７日，《人民日报》和《陕西日报》刊登《周至县终南镇派出所一天两起怪事：报案者被扣抓窍者挨骂》的报道，批评了终南镇派出所少数干警粗暴对待报案群众的错误。记者在采访过程中，曾同受害群众一起到派出所对证，派出所的当事人也在全所干警会上作了检查，并向受害农民赔礼道歉。可是批评报道见报后，这位当事人却声称报纸的批评“颠倒是非”、“严重失实”，向法院控告记者侵犯他的名誉权。新城区法院受理此案后，记者频频接到传票。
    西安市政法委员会调查有关情况后，要求市中级人民法院依法妥善处理此案。市中级人民法院会同新城区法院分析研究了案情，认为原告所诉不构成侵犯名誉权。２月１日，经新城区法院调解说服，原告提出了撤诉申请。
    ２月１５日，西安市中级人民法院就支持舆论监督，保护记者和公民合法权益，慎重受理诉新闻单位侵犯名誉权案向各区、县法院提出五条意见和措施，其中有：法院立案前要认真审查，在强调原告举证的同时应注意听取新闻单位的意见；对有关部门正在调查处理的诉新闻单位侵犯名誉权纠纷，法院一般不予立案；要严格区分正当的舆论批评与侵犯名誉权的界限，对由于工作失误，调查不细，以致报道失实，给当事人造成一定损害的，可以通过双方协商解决，由新闻单位予以澄清更正，对新闻单位正当的舆论监督，应坚决给予支持；对确有证据、构成侵害名誉权的，或借新闻舆论监督，故意侮辱诽谤他人，情节严重，构成侮辱诽谤罪的，予以立案，并依法处理。但是必须严格按其构成要件衡量，慎重从事。
