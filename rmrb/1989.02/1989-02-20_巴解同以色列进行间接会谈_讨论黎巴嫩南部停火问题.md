PLO and Israel Hold Indirect Talks to Discuss Ceasefire in Southern Lebanon

	New York, February 18 (Xinhua) - The leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization, Yasser Arafat, said in an interview with the American Columbia Broadcasting Company that the PLO is holding indirect talks with Israel on the issue of a ceasefire in southern Lebanon.

	Arafat said that the PLO and Israel are "communicating through certain channels," but he refused to reveal the details of the talks. He said the talks are "serious."

	When asked who participated in the talks, Arafat said that some Palestinians from the occupied territories, some Europeans, and some United Nations personnel took part.

	The Columbia Broadcasting Company will broadcast Arafat's interview on the "60 Minutes" television news program on Sunday.

	Arafat said that the two sides are discussing a ceasefire in southern Lebanon, similar to the agreement reached in 1981. He said that Israel is requesting the ceasefire.

	Israel invaded Lebanon in June 1982, attempting to drive the PLO out of southern Lebanon.

	When asked if he thought Israel would withdraw its troops from southern Lebanon, Arafat said, "What the Israelis are asking for is a ceasefire."

	Arafat said he hopes to have the opportunity to discuss Middle East peace issues with U.S. Secretary of State Baker and asked him to "help the Lebanese and Palestinian people get rid of Israel's occupation in southern Lebanon."

　　巴解同以色列进行间接会谈    
    讨论黎巴嫩南部停火问题
    新华社华盛顿２月１８日电  巴勒斯坦解放组织领导人阿拉法特在接受美国哥伦比亚广播公司采访时说，巴解组织正同以色列就黎巴嫩南部停火问题举行间接会谈。
    阿拉法特说，巴解和以色列正“通过某些渠道”进行会谈，但他拒绝透露会谈的详细内容。他说，会谈是“认真”的。
    当被问到哪些人参加了会谈时，阿拉法特说，一些被占领区的巴勒斯坦人、一些欧洲人和一些联合国人士参加了会谈。
    哥伦比亚广播公司将在星期天的“６０分钟”电视新闻节目中播放阿拉法特的谈话。
    阿拉法特说，巴、以双方正讨论在黎巴嫩南部实行停火，就像双方在１９８１年同意的那样。他说，以色列要求停火。
    以色列于１９８２年６月入侵黎巴嫩，企图把巴解组织从黎巴嫩南部赶走。
    有记者问阿拉法特他是否认为以色列将从黎巴嫩南部撤走它的部队，阿拉法特说，以色列人“要求的是停火”。
    阿拉法特说，他希望有机会同美国国务卿贝克讨论中东和平问题，并要求他“帮助黎巴嫩人民和巴勒斯坦人民摆脱以色列在黎巴嫩南部的占据。”
