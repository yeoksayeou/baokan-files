A few days ago, a "Yak-40" passenger plane with 30 seats had just taken off from the Sverdlovsk Airport when the airport received an anonymous call claiming that there was a bomb on board. For the safety of the passengers, the plane made an emergency landing. After a thorough inspection, no dangerous items were found, only a drunk man. The police investigation eventually revealed that it was a friend of this drunk man who made the prank call.

This prank caused the plane to be delayed for several hours, resulting in significant losses. The Soviet aviation authorities have filed a lawsuit and will seek compensation of several thousand rubles from the person who made the call.

　　开玩笑谎报客机有炸弹
　　苏航向恶作剧者起诉索赔
    据苏联《消息报》４日报道，前几天，一架有３０个座位的“雅克-４０”客机刚刚从斯维尔德洛夫斯克机场起飞，机场就接到匿名电话称，这架飞机上有炸弹。为了乘客安全，飞机进行了紧急着陆。经过仔细检查，任何危险物品都没有发现，只找到一名醉鬼。民警们通过调查最后得知，是这位醉鬼的朋友开玩笑打了匿名电话。
    这一恶作剧使飞机延误了几个小时，造成了很大损失。苏联航空部门已就此提出诉讼，将向这位打电话者索取数千卢布的赔偿。
