Last year in the market of Tieling City, a wave of panic buying swept through. Initially, it was high-end consumer goods like color televisions and refrigerators that were being snatched up. Later, rumors spread that the prices of grain and oil were going to rise, so people rushed to buy these supplies en masse, causing processing departments to be unable to meet the demand and grain stores to run out of stock. Even more absurd were the rumors that "low standards" were coming, causing widespread panic. It was only after seeing the article "The Municipal Government's Response to Several Issues Concerning Grain, Oil, Coal, Water, and Electricity That the Public is Currently Concerned About" in the "Tieling Daily" that everyone finally realized: "Oh, so that's what it was all about."

Mr. Lu Xun once recounted an incident in an essay: "When the Republic of China was established, I was living in a small county town, where the white flag had already been hoisted. One day, suddenly, I saw many men and women fleeing in disarray. Those in the city fled to the countryside, and those in the countryside fled into the city. When asked what was happening, they replied, 'They say it's coming.'"

What exactly is "it's coming"? When will it come? Who said "it's coming"? Is it really coming? And what will happen after "it comes"? How should one deal with it? No one bothered to investigate these questions; they just kept feeling anxious. From this, one can see the frightfulness of "it's coming."

However, I believe the frightfulness of "it's coming" does not lie in the actual "coming," but in the "it's coming" before the "coming." For example, everyone was originally living peacefully, but then someone secretly spread the rumor that an earthquake was "coming." Suddenly, everyone was in an uproar, factories stopped production, stores closed, and all bank deposits were withdrawn to buy a large amount of food for the escape route. But the earthquake did not actually "come." You see, isn't this even more frightening?

The frightfulness of "The Wolf is Coming" lies in distinguishing its truthfulness.

　　“来了”之可怕
    去年的铁岭市场上，刮起了抢购风。先是抢购彩电、冰箱等高档消费品，后来又风传供应粮油要涨价，于是又一窝蜂地抢购供应粮油，弄得加工部门供应不上，粮店拿不出货来。更有甚者传言说“低标准”要来了，闹得人心惶惶。直至看到了“铁岭日报”上登载的《市政府就群众当前关心的粮油煤水电等几个问题函告市民》后，大家才醒悟过来：“哦，原来是这么回事”。
    鲁迅先生曾经在一篇杂文中讲述过一件事情：“民国成立的时候，我住在一个小县城里，早已挂过白旗。有一日，忽然见许多男女，纷纷乱逃。城里的逃到乡下，乡下的逃进城里，问他们什么事，他们答道：‘他们说要来了。’”
    这“要来了”的究竟是什么？什么时间来？谁说的“要来了”？是不是真的“要来了”？以至于“来了”以后会如何，该怎样去对付，都没有人去追究，只是一个劲儿地惶惶然。由此可见这“来了”之可怕。
    然而，“来了”的可怕之处，我以为并不在于真“来了”，而在于“来了”之前的“来了”。譬如说，大家本来都平平安安的，忽然有人在暗地里传言，说地震要“来了”，于是大家顿时哗然，工厂不开工，商店不营业，存款全部取出来买了一大堆逃命路上用的食品。但地震又终于没有“来”，你想，这不是更可怕的么？
　　“狼来了”是否可怕，在于辨其真假。
