Night falls, and the sea breeze is strong. On New Year's Eve, the Yongshu Reef in the Nansha Islands is immersed in a festive atmosphere.

In a makeshift canteen set up with tents, soldiers and civilians gather to celebrate the New Year. Today's New Year's Eve dinner is particularly abundant, with fresh stir-fried vegetables, lotus root, mushrooms, chicken, fish, and meat on the table, along with beer, fresh coconut milk, and Health Plus beverages. The soldiers chat and laugh, enjoying their meal. The officers and soldiers say that this year's New Year goods were specially sent by ship from over 700 nautical miles away on the mainland. There are golden oranges, red apples, fresh vegetables, canned meat, and more than 30 varieties. They also slaughtered a pig and 9 chickens they raised on the reef.

After the New Year's Eve dinner, the soldiers gather around the television to happily watch the Spring Festival Gala broadcast by China Central Television. The screen's exciting performances instantly connect the Nansha soldiers' hearts with Beijing. Seeing the clear images on the screen, the soldiers on the reef are very grateful to the 12 comrades from the Beijing Satellite Ground Receiving Station. It was they who worked tirelessly for 13 days to build a multifunctional comprehensive satellite ground receiving station on Yongshu Reef, far from the mainland, allowing the soldiers to watch the Central Television broadcast on their first New Year's Eve in the Nansha Islands.

In the observation room of the marine observation station, the meteorological team leader Yin Hongyuan and the professional soldier Yang Shuikang are carefully observing and recording the sea tides, waves, wind direction, airflow, wind speed, and wind force in the Nansha sea area tonight. The satellite transmission machine continuously sends marine meteorological reports from Nansha to domestic and international locations, and the meteorological personnel accurately send the weather reports of Nansha to passing ships.

The ships anchored in the Yongshu Reef waters are brightly lit. On the deck, the Spring Festival Gala is lively and bustling. The sailors enthusiastically perform a self-choreographed "Sailor's Dance," recite poems expressing their longing for their hometown and loved ones titled "Family Joy," and engage in riddles and games. A male soloist sings "The Story of Nansha," sending the melody into the night sky, the song is melodious and heartfelt.

　　南沙除夕夜
    夜幕降临，海风劲吹。除夕之夜的南沙永暑礁沉浸在一片欢乐之中。
    在席棚搭起的简易饭堂里，军民欢聚一堂，举杯贺年。今天的年夜饭特别丰盛，桌上摆着炒得鲜嫩的蔬菜、莲藕、香菇、鸡、鱼、肉，还有啤酒、天然椰子奶和健力宝饮料等。官兵们有说有笑，吃得津津有味。干部战士说，今年的年货是上级专门派船从７００多海里远的大陆运来的。有黄澄澄的桔子、红艳艳的苹果、新鲜蔬菜、肉类罐头，品种有３０多个。他们还杀了自己在岛礁上养的一头猪和９只鸡。
    吃完年饭，官兵们围坐在电视机前，喜气洋洋地观看中央电视台播出的春节联欢晚会。荧屏上一个个精彩的节目，把南沙战士的心一下子和北京连到了一起。看着荧屏上清晰的图像，守礁官兵十分感激中国卫星北京地面接收站的１２名同志，是他们苦干１３天，在远离祖国大陆的永暑礁上建起了多功能综合性卫星地面接收站，使官兵们在南沙的第一个除夕之夜收看到了中央电视台的节目。
    在海洋观测站工作室里，气象分队长尹宏远和专业军士杨水康正仔细地观测记录今晚南沙海区的海潮、海浪、风向、气流、风速、风力等海洋水文气象资料。卫星发射机不停地把南沙海洋水文气象报发往国内外，气象人员把南沙的天气报告准确地发给过往的舰船。
    在永暑礁海域锚泊的舰船，灯光闪亮。甲板上，春节联欢晚会热闹非凡。水兵们兴高采烈地跳起自编自演的《水兵舞》，朗诵抒发对家乡亲人怀念之情的诗歌《家家乐》，还有猜谜语、做游戏……男高音独唱《南沙的故事》飞向夜空，歌声动听悠扬，充满深情。
