The activities of celebrities are often the subject of news, and British newspapers, particularly tabloids, frequently publish stories about celebrities. However, in recent years, British journalists have become increasingly cautious when reporting on such social news, as a small mistake can lead to libel lawsuits, causing significant financial losses for newspapers.

Last December, rock star Elton John sued *The Sun* for publishing false and defamatory content about him. *The Sun* quickly sought mediation to avoid a court battle, ultimately settling out of court with a compensation payment of one million pounds. In 1987, *The Star* published a story alleging that former Conservative Party deputy chairman and renowned novelist Jeffrey Archer had relations with a prostitute. The story was found to be false, resulting in a compensation payment of fifty million pounds. In November 1988, *The Sunday People* published an article stating that the former girlfriend of Prince Edward, the Queen's second son, Sarah Ferguson, had continued to meet with him even after his marriage. Ferguson sued the newspaper for libel, and the court ordered the newspaper to pay thirty million pounds in compensation. It is reported that Ferguson had previously received twenty million pounds in compensation from other newspapers for false stories about her and Prince Edward. Another significant compensation case for *The Sunday People* occurred in 1982, when it reported that footballer Billy Bremner had used bribery to manipulate the outcomes of several football matches, resulting in a compensation payment of ten million pounds for damage to his reputation.

According to British law, all published content is presumed to be false until proven otherwise. Unless the newspaper can prove that the reported content is entirely true, the newspaper, as the defendant, usually finds it difficult to win the case. Moreover, the courts often award high compensation amounts, so newspapers prefer to settle libel disputes out of court.

An article in the British *Economist* magazine noted that American law is different. If a well-known person sues a newspaper for libel, they must not only prove that the reported content is false but also show that the defendant acted with "reckless disregard for the truth," meaning they intentionally fabricated the story. Therefore, prominent Americans are less likely to sue newspapers for libel, fearing that they may not be able to provide sufficient evidence of the defendant's intentional falsehood, which would only make the situation worse. In 1984, former Israeli Defense Minister Ariel Sharon sued *Time* magazine for "libeling" him by accusing him of massacring Palestinian refugees and seeking five million dollars in compensation for "damage to his reputation." The lawsuit was dismissed due to a lack of evidence, and Sharon had to pay the court costs, which is a prime example.

　　诽谤与赔偿
    陈封
    知名人士的活动多半是新闻题材，英国的报纸（尤其是小型报）经常刊载名人逸事的新闻，但是近年来英国新闻记者们对于采访这方面的社会新闻越来越有如履薄冰之感，因为一不小心便会引起诽谤的诉讼，使报社大破其财。
    去年十二月摇滚歌星爱尔登·约翰控告《太阳》报的一篇报道内容不实，有损他的名誉，《太阳》报连忙托人讲情，希望不要对簿公庭，结果以赔偿一百万英镑私下了结。一九八七年《明星》报刊登一条消息，说前保守党副主席兼名小说家杰弗里·阿切尔和一名妓女有来往，结果因“事实不符”赔了五十万英镑。一九八八年十一月，《星期日人民》报发表一篇文章提到英国女王次子爱德华的前女友斯塔克曾在爱德华王子结婚以后还去和他幽会。斯塔克女士控告该报诽谤，法院判处该报赔偿三十万英镑。据说斯塔克女士以前因其它报纸发表她和爱德华王子的不实新闻已获得过二十万英镑的赔款。《星期日人民》报的另一次大宗赔款事件发生在一九八二年，因为它的一条新闻说足球运动员比利·布里姆奈曾以贿赂手段造成数次足球赛的假输赢，结果赔偿布里姆奈十万英镑名誉损失费。
    按照英国的法律，对于报刊上发表的一切文字都是以怀疑为出发点的。除非报社能够证明它所报道的内容完全真实，通常作为被告的报社是很难胜诉的。而且法院所判的赔款往往偏高，所以报社如果遇到诽谤纠纷，较愿求得院外解决。
    英国《经济学家》周刊的一篇文章说美国的法律则相反。如果一位知名人士控告某报诽谤，他不仅要证明报道的内容是虚假的，而且要证明被告是“毫无顾忌地违反事实”，即故意捏造。因此有头面的美国人较少和报纸打诽谤官司，以免由于提不出被告故意违反事实的充分证据而败诉，那就欲盖弥彰了。前以色列国防部长沙龙一九八四年到美国法院控告《时代》周刊“诽谤”他屠杀巴勒斯坦难民，索赔五千万美元“名誉损失费”，结果因提不出任何有力证据而败诉，反而倒贴了诉讼费，就是一例。
