The price of vegetables sold in state-run markets in Zhengzhou has become a reference point for both urban residents buying vegetables and farmers selling them. Over the past three months, state-run vegetable markets in Zhengzhou have actively participated in market regulation, stabilized vegetable prices, and ensured that residents' vegetable baskets are full, achieving noticeable results.

With the opening up and reform, Zhengzhou's agricultural markets have become increasingly prosperous. In contrast, state-run vegetable markets have become desolate and quiet. Thus, the saying "Zhengzhou's big anomaly: state-run vegetable markets don't sell vegetables" became a popular phrase among the people.

After the market was liberalized, vegetable prices naturally fluctuated with the market. Zhengzhou's leaders realized that relying on state subsidies to stabilize prices was not a solution, and returning to the old system of strict control was also not an option. They had to focus on addressing the root causes. Besides increasing effective supply through production, they also needed to establish a sound price management system and let state-run commerce play a leading role in stabilizing prices, making it difficult for those who want to drive up prices to succeed.

The Zhengzhou municipal government first chose 36 vegetable markets in areas with concentrated residential populations. These markets received no financial subsidies and had no fixed prices for vegetables. Prices were set based on the cost price and retail profit margin, with higher prices for higher costs and lower prices for lower costs. The government provided as much convenience as possible for state-run vegetable markets within its capacity. For example, in terms of the operating space, the government helped change the previous situation where "the market was layered inside and out, with stalls behind ropes, and state-run stalls behind the stalls." They cleared space for state-run vegetable markets. In terms of supply, wholesale departments actively assisted state-run vegetable markets in organizing purchases, only charging reasonable handling fees, and so on. This way, state-run vegetable markets could generally sell vegetables at slightly lower prices than agricultural markets.

After the main channels were reopened, the effects were quickly seen. The markets benefited the workers, motivating their enthusiasm; reasonable prices attracted the public. Now, state-run vegetable markets provide 150,000 kilograms of 6 to 7 varieties of vegetables to Zhengzhou residents daily, accounting for about 30% of the city's daily sales. State-run vegetable markets have played a role in stabilizing prices. Last year, during the off-season in December, vegetable prices were on average 14.8% lower than in September of the previous year, and they have since remained stable. The advantage of state-run vegetable markets is that they sell common vegetables, while individual vendors have shifted from selling common vegetables to other fresh vegetables. Together, they have enriched the market, making it difficult for those who want to drive up vegetable prices to cause trouble.

### 郑州国营菜场平抑物价初见效果　国营菜价成为市民买菜农民卖菜的参照系

　　郑州国营菜场平抑物价初见效果
　　国营菜价成为市民买菜农民卖菜的参照系
    本报讯  记者李而亮报道：“国营卖的什么价？”在今天，又成为郑州市居民买菜、农民卖菜时的参考价格。郑州市国营菜场近３个月来，积极参与市场调节，平抑菜价，保证群众菜篮子充实，取得明显效果。
    随着开放搞活，郑州市农贸市场日渐繁荣。可与之形成鲜明对照的是，国营菜市场一度变得萧条冷清。于是，“郑州一大怪，国营菜场不卖菜”成了群众的顺口溜。
    放开后的蔬菜市场，价格必然随行就市。郑州市的领导意识到，治理整顿，稳定物价，靠国家补贴不是办法，重新统起卡死，走回头路更不行，必须要在治本上下功夫。除了生产上要努力增加有效供给，价格管理上形成健全体系外，还要让国营商业发挥主渠道作用，平抑物价，使想哄抬物价的人折腾不起来。
    郑州市政府首先选择了居民集中区的３６个菜场，在财政上不给补贴，在蔬菜的定价上不限死，根据进价和零售利率高进高出，低来低走。政府在力所能及的范围里为国营菜场提供方便。例如在经营场地方面，政府协助改变过去市场上“里三层、外三层，街边一条绳，绳子后面是货亭，货亭后面是国营”的状况，给国营菜场腾出摊位；在货源方面，批发部门积极协助国营菜场组织进货，只收取合理的手续费，等等。这样，国营菜场的蔬菜一般能保持稍低于农贸市场的价格出售。
    主渠道重新开通后，很快收到了效果。菜场有利，调动了职工积极性；价格合理，吸引了群众。现在，国营菜场每天向郑州市居民提供１５万公斤、６至７个品种的蔬菜，占全市日销量的３０％左右。国营菜场发挥了平抑物价的作用。去年，蔬菜淡季的１２月份，菜价平均比去年９月下降了１４．８％，目前一直趋于平稳状态。国营菜场的优势是经营大路菜，个体商贩则从经营大路菜转向其它时鲜菜，双方共同丰富了市场，哄抬菜价的人很难掀起风浪。
