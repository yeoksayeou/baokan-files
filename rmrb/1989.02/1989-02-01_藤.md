	Wisteria
	Qiǎo Rì

	In the mountain-building movement, the seeds of wisteria
	had already been buried.
	At that time, there were no trees,
	and the forest had not yet been named.
	Broad-leaved trees mocked the metasequoia,
	spreading the bitter taste of ginkgo.
	Ancient camphor trees stretched out their clumsy forms
	to see what was going on.
	The wisteria had already climbed the high branches,
	twisting left and right, continuing to ascend.
	In Galileo's telescope,
	death covered the forest.
	The tendrils were greedy desires,
	wanting to pluck all the stars.

专栏：

　　藤
    超日
    造山运动中已埋进
    藤的种子那时
    还没有树
    森林更没有命名
    阔叶林嘲笑水杉
    散发银杏的苦味
    古樟探出稚拙的姿态
    看个究竟
    藤已攀悬高枝
    左旋右旋继续上升
    伽利略的望远镜里
    死气覆盖森林
    卷须是贪婪的欲念
    想摘除所有的星星
