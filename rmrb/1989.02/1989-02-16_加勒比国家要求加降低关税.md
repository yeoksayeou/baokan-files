Caribbean Commonwealth countries are demanding that the Canadian government allow their products to enter the Canadian market duty-free, just as it does for American products.

Bernard Yankey, the senior representative of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States, told reporters on the 13th that Caribbean countries are concerned that the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement will affect their interests. Therefore, these countries will urge Canada to equally reduce tariffs on products imported from the United States and the Caribbean during the Guyana meeting next month. According to the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement, which came into effect on January 1 of this year, Canada and the United States will eliminate all trade tariffs over the next ten years.
