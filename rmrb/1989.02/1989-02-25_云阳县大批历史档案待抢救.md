Edition: 6

Yunyang County has a large number of historical archives dating from 1882 (the seventh year of the Guangxu reign) to 1949, totaling 5,895 volumes. Due to poor storage conditions, these archives have been severely affected by moisture, mold, and insect damage, with most of them now riddled with holes. Although the leaders of the county archives bureau are also very concerned, they are helpless due to limited financial resources. We hope that relevant departments will take measures to rescue these archives.

　　云阳县大批历史档案待抢救
    我县档案馆藏有一八八二年（光绪七年）至一九四九年的历史档案五千八百九十五卷。由于保管条件太差，这些档案受潮、霉变、虫蛀十分严重，大部分已千疮百孔。虽然县档案局的领导人对此也十分着急，但因财力有限，毫无办法。希望有关部门采取措施，抢救这批档案。
