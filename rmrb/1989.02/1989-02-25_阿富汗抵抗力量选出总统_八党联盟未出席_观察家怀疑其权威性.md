Afghan Resistance Forces Elect President
Eight-Party Alliance Absent, Observers Doubt Authority

ISLAMABAD, Feb. 24 (Xinhua) — The Afghan resistance forces held a consultative meeting and re-elected Mujaddidi as the president of the interim government and Sayyaf as the prime minister, negating the election results of Feb. 18.

The consultative meeting of the Afghan resistance forces, held in the pilgrimage camp in Rawalpindi, reconvened on Feb. 23 after several adjournments. The previous meeting had adjourned due to a lack of agreement on the distribution of cabinet seats. This time, a "14-person committee" was formed, with each of the seven-party alliance parties sending two representatives. The committee decided to nullify the previous election results and draft a new election plan: the party with the most votes would produce the interim government president and the health minister; the party with the second-most votes would produce the prime minister and the transportation minister; the party with the third-most votes would produce the chief justice, the finance minister, and the education minister; the fourth-place party would produce the defense, science, and agriculture ministers; the fifth-place party would produce the interior, pilgrimage, and security ministers; the sixth-place party would produce the foreign and judicial ministers; the seventh-place party would produce the reconstruction, religious education, and resources ministers. This compromise plan was approved by the consultative meeting.

The election was held on Feb. 23, with over 400 representatives participating, each allowed to cast two votes. The election was conducted in secret, with fully armed resistance fighters tightly guarding the polling station. The entire election process was completed by the afternoon of Feb. 23, but the results were not announced until late that night. Mujaddidi, leader of the National Liberation Front, received 174 votes; Sayyaf, leader of the Islamic Alliance, received 173 votes; Muhammad, leader of the Islamic Revolutionary Movement, received 139 votes; Gulbuddin, leader of the Islamic Party (left wing), received 126 votes; Haris, leader of the Islamic Party (Khalis faction), received 102 votes; Rabbani, leader of the Islamic Society, received 99 votes; and Gailani, leader of the Islamic National Front, received 86 votes.

Some observers believe that in this election, the leaders of the seven-party alliance all took on roles in the interim government, making the power distribution more balanced compared to the previous election. However, due to the absence of the eight-party alliance and the fact that no candidate received more than half of the votes, the authority of the interim government formed by the elected leaders remains questionable.

### 阿富汗抵抗力量选出总统  八党联盟未出席　观察家怀疑其权威性

　　阿富汗抵抗力量选出总统
    八党联盟未出席　观察家怀疑其权威性
    本报伊斯兰堡２月２４日电  记者任毓骏报道：阿富汗抵抗力量协商会议否定了１８日的选举结果，重新选举穆贾迪迪为临时政府总统，萨亚夫为总理。
    在拉瓦尔品第朝觐营召开的阿富汗抵抗力量协商会议几经休会后于２３日复会。由于上次会议在分配内阁席位上未达成协议因而导致休会，这次复会后成立了一个“１４人委员会”，由七党联盟每党派出两名成员组成。该委员会决定将以前选举的结果推倒重来，并制订出新的选举方案：在获票最多的党派中产生临时政府总统和卫生部长；在获票第二的党派中产生总理和交通部长；在获票数第三名的党派中产生最高法院院长、财政部长和教育部长；在第四名中产生国防、科技和农业部长；在第五名中产生内务、朝觐和安全部长；在第六名中产生外交和司法部长；在第七名中产生重建、宗教教育和资源部长。这样，七党领导人都将担任领导职务并在内阁中得到相应的席位。这一折衷方案在协商会议获得通过。
    选举于２３日举行，参加协商会议的４００多名代表每人只准投２票。选举在秘密状况下进行，全副武装的抵抗力量战士严密保卫着选举厅。整个选举程序于２３日下午完成，但选举结果在２３日深夜才宣布。民族解放阵线领导人穆贾迪迪获１７４票，伊斯兰联盟领导人萨亚夫获１７３票，伊斯兰革命运动领导人穆罕默迪获１３９票，伊斯兰党（左派）古勒布丁获１２６票，伊斯兰党（哈派）哈里斯获１０２票，伊斯兰促进会拉巴尼获９９票，伊斯兰民族阵线盖拉尼获８６票。
    有观察家认为，这次选举中七党联盟领导人都担任了临时政府职务，比上次选举中的权力分配较为平衡。但由于没有八党联盟参加，再加之当选者中没有一人能超过半数，由其组成的临时政府的权威性仍成问题。
