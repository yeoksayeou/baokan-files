The Lever of Efficiency
—The Story of Li Wanren's Reform at the Daqing Building Materials Machinery Engineering Company
Zhang Fukuan, Wang Wenheng

Li Wanren is the manager of the Daqing Oilfield Building Materials Machinery Engineering Company. This title is a "rented" one. In September 1987, among numerous competitors, he leased this crisis-ridden enterprise with an annual profit of 600,000 yuan.

Taking over a company with over 200 employees, he gave up his position as a dispatching director in a large company. Some people felt sorry for him. Li Wanren said: If it were for the "official hat and feather," I wouldn't have come. I want to test my abilities and see if I can flip over to the "South Heaven Gate."

		Competition Brings Efficiency

The company, though small, had 36 people working in the office. Naturally, there were no shortage of officials who "drink tea at work and collect salaries at the end of the month."

After Li Wanren took over, he conducted a test on the office staff and found that each person worked only 3 hours and 10 minutes per day on average.

Just as a teacher who teaches half-heartedly cannot produce excellent students, a lazy office cannot lead to a high-efficiency enterprise.

Economists say: People's choice of profession is the starting point of economic activity.

Li Wanren decided to reform at the starting point. He announced: The employees of this company can freely choose their positions. The first "special economic zone" to be opened was the office.

Li Wanren first divided the office work into 60 main and auxiliary positions. Then, based on the position of each job in the company, the complexity of the work, the technical requirements, and the amount of work, he set a salary standard for each position. The highest monthly salary was 200 yuan, and the lowest was only 10 yuan. Of course, he also set strict work standards and goals for these positions.

On the day of the bidding, almost everyone in the company came. Bidding, speeches, and defense, it was quite lively.

Competition brings out the best, 29-year-old female employee Meng Xueqing, fought off all competitors, and took on seven positions, doing the work of four people. The combined salary of the seven positions is 240 yuan per month. Previously, her monthly salary was only 72 yuan. Now, she works efficiently and skillfully, and all the work she manages has been rated first by higher authorities.

The 28-year-old Li Shuzhi, originally a driver of a "Liberation" truck. This time, she won five positions, instantly moving from the "driver's cabin" to the office building, doing the work that three people used to do, and her salary also rose from the original 61 yuan to 180 yuan.

Public competition reduced the office staff by half, and the company saved more than 1,200 yuan in monthly salary expenses alone. However, work efficiency was several times higher. Of course, competition is not a sweet love song. When Li Wanren expanded the "special economic zone" practice to the entire company, more than 100 people in the company were squeezed out. Although they felt bad, these people accepted it. However, Li Wanren did not forget them. After training, he used these people as the main force to develop three new industries, which created nearly 10 million yuan in output value for the company last year.

		Workers Love Labor Again

Distribution is the endpoint of economic activity, but it affects people's choice of profession and the overall efficiency of economic activity. When the distribution mechanism fails, labor becomes a heavy burden for people, and people even hate labor.

A driver once secretly blocked the oil line with cotton to avoid driving. The car "broke down," and the order to send him on the road was also canceled.

There were even bolder ones who sold the gasoline in the car and the tires on the road, and when they returned, they could still get a new one...

These things were too depressing. But they happened before Li Wanren took over. Can workers "run without a whip"?

Li Wanren divided the company's goal of creating annual profits into each worker's responsibility using the economic contract method. The company only specifies the amount of profit to be handed over to the workers, and then, according to the profit handed over, the income is extracted in proportion. Want to earn more salary? There are only two ways: one is to work more; the other is to spend less, thus creating the most profit.

This method cultivated the workers' sense of value and also made the workers change from passive labor to active labor. Because whoever is not proactive cannot realize their own economic interests. In July 1988, the installation team of the company was working in the wilderness, and heavy rain poured down. The workers worked in the rain without the client's supervision or the cadres' mobilization, only busy hands.

On another construction site, the construction team of this company and another unit's construction team laid pipelines simultaneously. During the inspection, the people of this company could complete 21 joints per person per day; while the other construction team, each person could only complete 6 joints per day.

The workers' active pursuit of labor made this company achieve a relatively high labor efficiency. In 1988, the labor productivity of the first 11 months reached 65,000 yuan per person, an increase of five times over the previous year. Li Wanren flipped a beautiful "somersault," and the enterprise entered the "high-speed road" of development. Li Wanren should be satisfied, right? No, Li Wanren said: This is just the beginning. Next year, our goal is that the annual labor rate will reach 90,000 yuan!

　　撬动效率的杠杆   
    ——大庆建材机械工程公司经理李万仁改革纪事
    张福宽　王文恒
    李万仁，大庆油田建材机械工程公司的经理。这个头衔，是“租”来的。１９８７年９月，在众多的对手中，他以年上缴６０万元利润的“高价”，租赁了这个危机四伏的企业。
    当上了一个２００多人小企业的经理，却丢掉一个大公司的调度长。有人为他遗憾。李万仁则说：若为“顶戴花翎”，我就不来了。我要试试自己的能量，看能不能一个跟头翻到“南天门”上。
    　　　　竞争出效率
    企业虽小，蹲机关的竟有３６人。自然不乏“上班喝茶水，月末领薪水”的干部。
    李万仁租赁后，曾对机关进行一次实测，发现，人均每天才工作３小时１０分钟。
    正如二分老师教不出五分学生一样，一个怠惰成习的机关，绝不会带出一个高效率的企业。
    经济学家称：人们对职业的选择，是经济活动的始点。
    李万仁决定在始点处改革。他宣布：本公司的职工，可以自由选择岗位。成为第一个开放“特区”的是机关。
    李万仁，先把机关工作划分为６０个主、副岗。然后，依据每岗在企业中所处的地位、工作繁杂程度、技术要求高低、工作量大小，为每个岗位制定了工资标准。高的月工资２００元，低的月工资才１０元。当然，他也为这些岗位制定了严格的工作标准和工作目标。
    招标那天，全公司的人几乎都来了，投标、演说、答辩，好不热闹。
    竞争，争出能人，２９岁的女职工孟旭清，力战群雄，一人争来七个岗位，揽了原来四个人的工作。七个岗位的工资相加每月２４０元。过去，她的月工资才７２元。现在，她干的井井有条，得心应手，她所分管的工作，项项被上级单位评为第一名。
    ２８岁的李淑芝，原是开“解放”车的。这次，争来五个岗位，一下子从“驾驶楼”登上了办公楼，干上了过去三个人干的工作，工资也由原来的６１元，“涨”到１８０元。
    公开竞争，机关人员减了一半，每月仅工资开支公司就减支１２００多元。而工作效率却是过去的几倍。当然，竞争不是甜蜜的情歌。当李万仁把机关“特区”的做法扩大到整个公司时，全公司竟有１００多人被挤了出来。尽管心里难受，这些人也认了。但是，李万仁没有遗忘他们，经过培训，以这些人为主体，开辟了三项新产业，去年为公司创产值近千万元。
    　　　　职工热爱劳动了
    分配，经济活动的终点，但它影响着人们对职业的选择，更影响着整个经济活动的效率。当分配机制出现故障，劳动也就成了人们沉重的负担，人们甚至痛恨劳动。
    一个司机为逃避出车，悄悄用棉球堵塞了油路。车“坏了”，让他上路的指令也就取消了。
    还有胆大的，路上敢卖掉车中的汽油、车上的轮胎，回来后，居然又能领个新的……
    这些事，太让人悲观了。但它就发生在李万仁租赁前。那么，能否让职工“不用扬鞭自奋蹄”呢？
    李万仁把企业追求的目标——年创利润，用经济承包的办法，分解到每个职工的头上。企业对职工只规定上缴利润数，然后依据上缴的利润，按比例提取收入。想多拿工资吗？那好，途径只两条：一是多干；二是少花，从而创造最多的利润。
    这个方法，培养了职工的价值意识，也使职工由过去被动地劳动变成了积极主动劳动。因为谁不主动，谁就实现不了自己的经济利益。１９８８年７月，公司安装队在荒野里施工，大雨倾盆而至。职工冒雨施工，没有甲方的督促，没有干部的动员，只有一双双忙碌的手。
    在另一个工地上，这个公司的施工队同另一单位的施工队同时铺设管线，验收时，这个公司的人，人均每天能干２１道口；而另一施工队，人均每天才干６道。
    职工对劳动的主动追求，使这个公司创造了相当高的劳动效率。１９８８年，前１１个月的全员生产率达到了６．５万元，比上年全年增加了５倍。李万仁翻了一个漂亮的“跟头”，企业进入了发展的“高速公路”。李万仁该满意了吧？不，李万仁说：这才是开头，明年，我们的目标是全年劳动率将达到９万元！
