The Beijing Xidan Department Store's total retail sales for 1988 exceeded 550 million yuan, with an average profit per person of 190,000 yuan. Both figures represent a growth of over 20% compared to the previous year. With these results, the store's main economic indicators have ranked first among Beijing's large retail stores for three consecutive years.

Xidan Department Store has implemented a tiered contract responsibility system within the store and was the first among Beijing's large commercial enterprises to reform the wage system, expanding its operations. Currently, the store's procurement channels cover the entire country, with 89 factories directly supplying the store. The store's joint venture with the Tongxian Food Company, the Tongxian branch, has played a significant role in promoting the sale of industrial goods to rural areas, with sales reaching nearly 16 million yuan and a profit of 610,000 yuan in 1988.
