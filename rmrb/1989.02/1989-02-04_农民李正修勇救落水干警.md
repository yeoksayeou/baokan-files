Farmer Li Zhengxiu bravely rescued fallen police officers in the scene of an oil barge explosion and fire on the Yangtze River. He risked his life to drive his motorized sailboat to assist firefighters in extinguishing the fire and saved five firefighters who had fallen into the water. On January 21, the Wuhan Municipal Government awarded Li Zhengxiu a second-class merit citation.

On the morning of January 2, around 8 a.m., Li Zhengxiu heard that police officers needed to be transported across the river to fight the fire. Despite severe stomach pain and without eating breakfast, he immediately set sail with his assistant on his motorized sailboat, carrying the firefighters at the fastest speed towards the burning oil barge No. 63040 to assist in extinguishing the fire. About 10 minutes later, a deafening explosion threw the firefighters who were on the oil barge into the icy cold river.

"Quick, save them!" Li Zhengxiu was the first to shout. At the time of the explosion, he was at the stern of the oil barge waiting for orders. As the heatwave hit, he immediately jumped back into the cabin, discovering that the glass on the control panel had been shattered and a ball of flames was approaching. In the nearby waters, he saw several helmets bobbing. In the critical moment, he remained calm and alert, quickly ducking his head and turning the wheel to the left, avoiding the rolling air currents and the spraying oil fire. He then drove the boat towards the fallen firefighters. He shouted for help while directing the young farmers Lin Yinping and Li Qiquan, who were on the boat, and the soldiers who were pumping water, to quickly grab bamboo poles and throw out water hoses to rescue the fallen firefighters. About 10 meters away from the boat, a soldier was struggling in the water, seemingly about to be swallowed by the river. Li Zhengxiu sped up the boat, reached the soldier, and used a bamboo pole to hook the soldier's clothes, pulling him onto the boat. Then, Li Zhengxiu shouted, "Quick, use the blankets and sheets in the cabin to wrap the injured!" He saw Deputy Commander Li Jinwen struggling to surface and quickly rescued him. The boat continued searching on the left side of the oil barge and suddenly spotted floating debris on the water surface. It turned out to be soldier Tian Xiaolin, who had been severely injured by flying metal debris. After pulling him onto the boat, he was already barely breathing. Li Zhengxiu instructed the people on the boat to perform mouth-to-mouth resuscitation until Tian Xiaolin died a heroic death. In the midst of the flames and thick smoke on the river, Li Zhengxiu, despite the danger of the leaking and burning crude oil, persisted in rescuing people for nearly half an hour until he was sure there were no more people in the water. He then quickly drove the boat to the opposite shore, delivering the five seriously injured soldiers to the hospital for emergency treatment.

　　农民李正修勇救落水干警
    武汉市汉南区水洪乡个体水上运输户李正修，在长江油驳爆炸燃烧现场，冒着生命危险，毅然驾驶机帆船协助消防干警灭火，救起５名落水的消防战士。１月２１日，武汉市政府给李正修荣记二等功。
    １月２日上午８时许，李正修听说要送干警渡江灭火，他不顾阵阵胃疼，也顾不上吃早饭，同助手一道马上拔锚起航，驾起自家的机帆船载着消防战士以最快的速度，向燃烧的６３０４０油驳尾部靠近，协助灭火。约１０分钟后，随着一声震耳欲聋的巨响，巨大的气流将正在６３０４０油驳上灭火的消防战士抛进冰冷刺骨的江水里。
    “快救人！”李正修第一个这样喊。油驳爆炸时，他正在油驳尾部待命。随着热浪袭来，他立即跳回驾驶舱，发现驾驶台的玻璃被震破，一团烈焰迎面袭来。在自己小船附近江面，有７、８个头盔在晃动。生死关头，他沉着冷静，机警地把头一歪，将舵往左一打，让过滚滚气流和喷射的油火，驾着船迎着落水战士急驶。他一边疾呼救人，一边指挥一同上船的青年农民林因平、李启泉和在船上压水的战士，迅速举起竹竿，抛出水龙带，救援落水战士。离船１０多米处有名战士在江水中时沉时浮，眼看就要被江水吞没，他加快船速，赶到这名战士身边，用竹竿挑住战士的衣服将他救上船。接着，李正修大喊：“快用舱里的被子、床单把伤员裹起来！”他发现副队长李金文挣扎着浮出水面后，又赶到李金文身边，救起李金文。船在油驳的左边继续搜寻着，突然发现水面上有浮沉物，原来是被钢铁碎片炸成重伤的战士田晓林，人们将他救上船后，已奄奄一息，李正修让船上的人做人工呼吸，直到田晓林光荣牺牲。在火舌喷射、浓烟翻涌的江面上，李正修不顾原油外溢燃烧的危险，坚持救人近半个钟头，直到确认江面上没有落水者后，他才将船疾驶对岸，将５名重伤员送医院抢救。
