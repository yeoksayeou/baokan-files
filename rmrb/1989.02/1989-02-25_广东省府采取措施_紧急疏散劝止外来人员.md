The Guangdong provincial government has taken measures to urgently disperse and deter outsiders.

Our reporter, Liang Zhaoming, reports from Guangzhou: "The Guangdong labor market has an excess of labor and cannot arrange jobs for outsiders." This was repeatedly emphasized at an emergency telephone conference held by the Guangdong provincial government last night.

Since the Spring Festival this year, tens of thousands of people from other provinces have entered Guangdong every day, with the majority staying in Guangzhou and the Pearl River Delta region near train stations, docks, and roadsides.

The provincial government has demanded that work be done to promptly send the outsiders who have been wandering back to their hometowns and to deter those who are still blindly rushing into Guangdong.

　　广东省府采取措施
    紧急疏散劝止外来人员
    本报广州２月２４日电  记者梁兆明报道：“广东劳务市场劳力过剩，不能安排外来人员工作。”这是广东省政府昨晚召开紧急电话会议一再重申的。
    今年春节后，每天有几万至十来万外地人员进入广东，大部分滞留在广州和珠江三角洲地区的车站、码头和公路旁。
    省政府要求做好工作，及早地使盲流的外来人员返回家乡，并劝止仍在盲目涌进广东的外来人员。
