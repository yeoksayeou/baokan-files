In recent years, the issue of economic cycle fluctuations in China has garnered widespread discussion. Last year, national conferences on economic cycle fluctuations were held consecutively in Beijing and Changchun. Currently, research in this area has yielded some preliminary results. The main points are summarized as follows.

(1) Economic system reform calls for and drives the study of economic cycle fluctuations. Only by breaking through this barrier can we deeply reveal the intrinsic mechanisms of socialist economic cycle fluctuations and provide a solid theoretical foundation for smoothly carrying out economic system reform and maintaining long-term stable economic development. To this end, we must not only focus on the study of short-term fluctuations of two to three years or a few months but also strengthen the study of medium-term economic fluctuations of about five years and longer-term economic fluctuations. This research, based on the analysis of the interrelationships between prices, credit, currency, investment, and industrial and agricultural production, should also be conducted from a broader socio-economic background, involving multi-factor, multi-level correlation analysis. For this, we need to introduce exogenous variables such as climate, geography, population, education, science and technology, politics, military, diplomacy, and foreign trade, and extract some quantitative indicators that have significant impacts on medium and long-term economic fluctuations to establish mathematical models. For example, based on the existing statistical data, we can conduct a background analysis of the economic development prospects for the next 10 years, thus making a more scientific prediction of China's economic development prospects in the 1990s and providing a scientific basis for the formulation of various policies in China's economic reform and economic construction.

(2) Some characteristics of economic cycle fluctuations in China. Many comrades believe that economic cycle fluctuations are inherent in socialized mass production, and their manifestations are determined by the internal and external conditions of socialized mass production. From the perspective of short-term fluctuations, some comrades, through the analysis of 207 macroeconomic variables in China, found that the fluctuation length of most variables is between 2 to 3 years, with an average fluctuation time of 27 months. Industrial production from 1971 to 1987 experienced 8 cycles of fluctuations over 17 years.

In terms of the correlation characteristics between loan fluctuations and industrial fluctuations, since 1972, industrial loans have experienced 6 short-term cyclical fluctuations, with an average length of 31 months. Before 1982, the loan cycle and the industrial cycle ran in opposite directions, with the peak of the loan cycle roughly corresponding to the trough of the industrial cycle, and the degree of loan fluctuation being smaller than that of industrial fluctuation. Starting from 1982, the loan cycle and the industrial cycle began to run in the same direction, and the degree of loan fluctuation became larger than that of industrial fluctuation. Some comrades believe that the economic fluctuations before the reform were a type of fiscal-led fluctuations, while the economic fluctuations in China after the reform are a type of credit-led fluctuations.

In terms of the correlation characteristics between the economic cycle and monetary growth, from 1953 to 1987, the growth rate of China's monetary circulation also showed a certain cyclical pattern. The growth of monetary circulation experienced approximately 7 cycles. Compared to the economic cycle, the monetary growth cycle has two distinct characteristics: First, the timing of the monetary cycle and the economic cycle is different. Except for the first cycle, the other cycles of monetary growth fluctuations lag behind economic growth fluctuations by 1 to 2 years, meaning that during the 1 to 2 years of economic recovery, money usually grows at a slower rate. Then, the economy and money expand simultaneously, reaching a certain point where the economy experiences a decline, while money still maintains a high growth rate. After a period of time, it begins to decline. However, the decline does not last long, and the economy starts a new expansion. Second, the amplitude of monetary fluctuations is larger than that of economic fluctuations, and they have different development trends. The amplitude of economic fluctuations shows a trend of gradual deceleration, while the amplitude of monetary fluctuations decreased in the first 4 cycles but intensified in the latter 3 cycles.

(3) Mathematical analysis models of economic cycle fluctuations in China. The comprehensive results of analyzing economic cycle fluctuations from the aspects of quality, quantity, and degree are helpful in controlling economic cycle fluctuations. The most challenging part of this theoretical exploration, which is closely linked to practice, is to conduct detailed quantitative calculations based on qualitative analysis and construct the optimal mathematical analysis model. Starting from Marx's principle of the two departments of social production, the constructed models of balanced growth and dynamic equilibrium of "speed" and "proportion" are models that combine qualitative analysis with quantitative analysis, transitioning from qualitative analysis to quantitative calculation. Based on the principle of spectral analysis, the model constructed according to the Fourier series is also a model that combines quantitative analysis with qualitative analysis. There are also various mathematical tools such as correlation analysis, complex variable methods, and fuzzy mathematics used to construct mathematical analysis models. These studies are all in the exploratory stage.

(4) Thoughts on counter-cyclical strategies. Analyzing economic cycles involves breaking down the cycles into fundamental waves and various harmonics, including normal harmonics and abnormal harmonics. The latter refers to economic cycle fluctuations in an abnormal state. Therefore, "counter-cyclical" means filtering out these harmonics, and the "strategy" is a type of filter that restores economic cycle fluctuations to a normal state.

Many comrades have discussed the dilemma of counter-cyclical strategies under a dual system. The primary goal of counter-cyclical measures is to prevent and overcome significant economic fluctuations and imbalances. Some comrades believe that the characteristic of economic cycle fluctuations in China under the current dual economic system is a "stagflation spiral," where both total demand and total money supply are expanding, leading to "inflationary" demand. "Stagnation," on the other hand, is manifested by the contraction of production investment, low enterprise production efficiency, and worsening shortages in effective supply. In this situation, the incentive effect of bonuses is reduced, on-the-job unemployment is severe, and the economic structure is imbalanced. Under the pressure of "dual inflation," supply elasticity generates a relatively high negative slope. Therefore, counter-cyclical strategies are challenging. This difficulty is mainly reflected in the following: 1. Tightening will exacerbate shortages, making the supply side even more insufficient, while expansion will exacerbate demand inflation. 2. In terms of means selection, using administrative measures will strengthen the old system's maladies, while using market measures will be ineffective due to the imperfect micro-mechanism. 3. Expectation adjustment will fail due to changes in indicators, while lagged adjustment will be of no avail. It seems that the "stagflation" under the dual system will be long-term, and further research on strategies is needed.

　　我国经济周期波动问题探索
    郑开昭
    近年来，关于我国经济周期波动问题，已引起广泛的探讨。去年先后在北京和长春召开了全国经济周期波动问题研讨会。目前，这方面的研究已取得一些初步成果。现将主要观点简述如下。
    （一）经济体制改革呼唤并推动经济周期波动这个禁区的研究。只有这种突破，才能深入揭示社会主义经济周期波动的内在机理，为顺利进行经济体制改革和保持国民经济长期稳定的发展提供坚实的理论基础。为此，我们不仅要注重对两三年或几个月这种短期波动的研究，而且应加强对５年左右的中周期和更长周期的经济波动的研究。这种研究在分析物价、信贷、货币、投资等与工农业生产间的联带关系的基础上，还要从更大的社会经济背景出发进行多因素、多层次的相关分析。为此，要引进气候、地理、人口、教育、科技、政治、军事、外交、外贸等多种外生变量，从中提取一些对中长期经济波动有重要影响的数量指标建立数学模型。比如，根据现有的统计数据，对未来１０年的经济发展前景进行大背景分析，这样就能对我国９０年代的经济发展前景做出比较科学的预测，为我国经济改革和经济建设中各项政策的制定提供科学依据。
    （二）我国经济周期波动的某些特征。许多同志认为，经济周期波动是社会化大生产所固有的，其表现特征是由社会化大生产所具有的内部条件和外部条件决定的。从短期波动看，有同志通过对我国２０７个宏观经济变量的分析发现，大多数变量的波动长度都在２至３年，平均波动时间是２７个月。工业生产从１９７１年至１９８７年的１７年间，共发生过８次周期性波动。
    就贷款波动与工业波动的关联特征来看，１９７２年以来，工业贷款共经历６次短期周期性波动，平均长度为３１个月。１９８２年以前，贷款周期与工业周期呈反向运行，贷款周期的峰值与工业周期的谷底大体相对应，贷款波动程度小于工业波动程度；从１９８２年开始，贷款周期与工业周期转而呈同向运行，且贷款波动大于工业波动。有同志认为，改革前的经济波动是一种财政主导型波动；改革后的我国经济波动是一种信用主导型波动。
    就经济周期与货币增长的关联特征来看，从１９５３年至１９８７年，我国货币流通量增长速度亦呈现出一定的周期规律。货币流通量增长大体经历了７个周期。与经济周期相比较，货币增长周期具有两个明显的特征：第一，货币周期与经济周期发生的时间不同，除了第一个周期相吻合外，其它几个周期货币增长波动比经济增长波动滞后１至２年，即在经济回升的１至２年内货币往往以低速度增长，然后，经济与货币同时扩张，到一定程度经济出现回落，货币仍然保持较高增长速度，经过一段时间后才开始下降。然而，下降时间不长，经济又开始了新的扩张。第二，货币波动的振幅比经济波动的振幅要大，并且具有不同的发展趋势。经济波动的幅度有不断减缓趋势，而货币波动幅度在前４个周期有所减缓，后３个周期又逐渐加剧。
    （三）我国经济周期波动的数学分析模型。对经济周期波动进行质、量、度三个方面分析的综合结果，有助于驾驭经济周期波动。这项理论密切联系实践的探索工作，最困难之处是在质的分析基础上周密地进行量的计算，构筑最佳的数学分析模型。从马克思的社会生产两大部类原理出发，构筑的均衡增长及“速度”与“比例”的动态均衡模型，是从质的分析过渡到量的计算、定性分析与定量分析相结合的分析模型。从频谱分析原理出发，按照福里哀级数构筑的模型，也是一种定量分析与定性分析相结合的分析模型。还有用相关分析法、复变函数方法、模糊数学方法等多种数学工具构筑数学分析模型，这些研究都处在探索之中。
    （四）反周期对策的思考。解析经济周期波，分为基波及各次谐波，其中有正常的谐波和非正常的谐波，后者指经济周期波动处在不正常状态。因此，“反周期”就是要滤去这种谐波，其“对策”就是一种滤波器，使经济周期波动恢复正常状态。
    不少同志探讨了双重体制下反周期对策的困境。反周期主要是为了防止和克服经济大的起伏和失衡。有同志认为，我国在当前双重经济体制下的周期波动特点是“滞胀螺旋”，即总需求和总货币供给都膨胀，造成“膨胀”的需求；而“停滞”则表现为生产投资收缩，企业生产效率低，有效供给短缺程度加剧。在这种情况下，奖金刺激作用减少，在职失业严重，经济结构失衡。在“双胀”压力下，供给弹性产生较高负斜率。因此，反周期对策很困难，这种困难主要表现为：１、紧缩会加剧短缺，使供给方面更不足，而扩张则加剧需求膨胀；２、手段选择上，采用行政手段会强化旧体制痼疾，采用市场手段又会因微观机制不健全而难以奏效；３、预期调节会因指标变动而失败，滞后调节则于事无补。看来双重体制下的“滞胀”将是长期的，应进一步研究其对策。
