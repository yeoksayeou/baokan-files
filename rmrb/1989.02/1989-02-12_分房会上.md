At the end of the year, the Chemical and Electrical Machinery Factory in Xingtai, Hebei Province, allocated housing. During the meeting to announce the preliminary allocation plan, an unexpected conflict arose.

The basic principles of housing allocation were proposed by the factory director, Bu Xingyu: 1) Those who entered the factory earliest and made significant contributions; 2) Engineering and technical personnel; 3) Those living in three-generational households or facing the most severe housing difficulties.

These principles were very fair, and no one raised objections. The housing allocation committee, after thorough investigation and full consultation with the masses, held a meeting to announce the cumulative scores. To Bu Xingyu's surprise, the person with the highest score and top ranking was himself. This made him quite flustered. He immediately announced, "I'll manage to live a few more years like this. I won't take it this year, nor next year, nor the year after. As long as I am the factory director here, I should be the last to receive a house!"

His words had barely fallen when someone protested, criticizing, "In a certain place, there was a factory director who, with his wife, occupied a three-bedroom apartment, gave his eldest son and daughter each a two-bedroom apartment, and finally gave his three-year-old youngest son a marriage apartment. You are also a factory director; slightly improving your living conditions, who would say anything?"

Another attendee suggested that it didn't matter whether he was a factory director or not; the allocation should still be based on conditions. In terms of seniority, Bu Xingyu was one of the founders of this factory; in terms of contributions, before he took over as director in 1985, the factory had been operating at a loss for 15 years, totaling 1.62 million yuan. After he took over, he boldly reformed, achieving a profit and tax of 250,000 yuan in the first year, and 620,000 yuan in 1987. Workers often praised, "Our director Bu." He also made a grand promise to build a dormitory building for the factory every year, and this housing allocation was for the first completed building. As for housing difficulties, workers often commented, "The one with the most housing difficulties in our factory is probably Director Bu!"

How difficult was Director Bu's housing situation? He and his wife Liu Xue Shu had been married for 18 years and had never lived in a separate room. During their early marriage, due to lack of housing, they had to defy local customs and squeeze into his father-in-law's home. However, his father-in-law's situation was also dire. The grandmother, parents-in-law, younger brother, and younger sister, three generations and seven people, all lived in one room. That room was partitioned off with a curtain to serve as the bridal chamber. The young couple dared not even breathe loudly.

Eighteen years had passed, and Director Bu's son was already 17 years old, and his daughter was 15. The original three-generational household had long since become a four-generational household. Although the younger brother and sister had married and moved out, the entire family still crowded into the same room they had 18 years ago.

If there had been any changes, it was that he had become the factory director, and this four-generational household room often had to serve as a reception room. Director Bu usually returned home around 9 PM, and workers often visited his home after 9 PM, sometimes filling the house. No matter how late the guests stayed, the director's wife had to sit with them. The son and daughter had no choice but to go to the downstairs hallway, which was bustling with people, and study under the 25-watt streetlight. The entire family, including Director Bu, did not smoke. However, most of the guests did. After the guests left, even in the cold winter, the director's wife had to open the windows to ventilate and sweep the floor. Otherwise, how could they sleep with the room full of smoke and the floor littered with cigarette butts? The conditions were there, and Director Bu's situation was also there. Even those who had some grievances against Director Bu privately told others, "In all conscience, it's time to allocate a house to Director Bu!"

　　分房会上
    罗同松　任宏斌　陈玉民
    年前，河北省邢台市化工电机厂分了一次房子。在公布预分方案的会议上，产生了一个意想不到的矛盾。
    分房的基本原则，是厂长部醒语提出的：１、进厂最早，对工厂有贡献者；２、工程技术人员；３、三世同堂共室或住房最困难者。
    这原则十分公道，没有人提出反对意见。分房小组经过周密调查，充分听取群众意见，开会公布了累积分数。出乎部醒语意料，分数最高，名列榜首的竟是他自己。这下他可慌神了，当场宣布：“我再凑合着住几年吧。今年不要，明年不要，后年也不要。只要是我在这里当厂长，就最后一个分给我房子好了！”
    他的话音刚落，便有人表示“抗议”，数落说：某地有个厂长，自己两口子占了一套三居室，给大儿子、女儿各占了一套两居室，最后还给仅有３岁的小儿子占了一套结婚房。“你老部也是厂长，稍微改善一下，谁能说什么！”
    与会另一位主张不要说什么厂长不厂长，还是按条件办事为好。说厂龄，论资格，部醒语是这家工厂的筹建者之一；说贡献，１９８５年他就任厂长前，厂子１５年共计亏损１６２万元，他上任后，大胆改革，头年实现利税２５万元，１９８７年上缴利税６２万元，工人们端起饭碗，总是称赞“我们老部”。他还许下宏愿，每年为厂里盖一幢宿舍楼，这次分房，正是第一幢楼竣工了。至于说到住房困难，平时工人们中就有议论：“咱厂里住房最紧的恐怕要数部厂长！”
    部醒语住房紧到什么程度？他和妻子刘学书结婚１８年，从来没有单独住过一间房子。新婚那阵子因为无房，只好违背当地风俗，挤在岳父家。可是，岳父家的情况也不妙。老祖母、岳父母，加上小舅子、小姨子，三代七口挤在一间房子里。那房子辟出一角，挂上布帘，就算是新房。小两口连大气也不敢出。
    １８个春秋过去了，部醒语的儿子已经１７岁，女儿也已１５岁，原来的三代同堂早已成为四代同堂。除了小舅子、小姨子已成家搬出，一大家子仍然挤在１８年前的那间房子里。
    如果说变化，那就是他已经当上了厂长，这间四代同堂的房子经常要作为会客室使用。部醒语一般要晚上９点才回家，工人们爱在晚上９点以后上他家坐坐，有时一去一屋子人。不管客人坐多晚，厂长夫人得陪着坐多晚。儿子和女儿呢，只好到楼下那人来人往的门洞里，就着那盏２５瓦的路灯复习功课。他们全家，包括部醒语，都不会抽烟。而客人们大多是抽烟的。客人走后，即使是严冬，厂长夫人也得打开门窗通风，拿来扫帚扫地。不然，那满屋烟雾，满地烟头叫人怎么过夜？条件摆在那儿，部厂长家的情况也摆在那儿，即使是过去对部醒语有些意见的人也私下对人说：“凭良心，这次是该分给老部一套房子！”
