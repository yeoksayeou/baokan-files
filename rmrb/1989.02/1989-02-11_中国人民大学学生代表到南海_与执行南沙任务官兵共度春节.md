During the winter vacation, 29 student representatives from Renmin University traveled thousands of miles from Beijing to the South China Sea Fleet. They spent the Spring Festival with the soldiers carrying out missions in the Nansha Islands.

After arriving at the military base, the students visited islands, ships, and hospitals, extending their greetings to the naval officers and soldiers on duty in the Nansha Islands. They learned about the geographical features and natural resources of the Nansha Islands. At a symposium held at a certain base, the school's Communist Youth League secretary, Wang Wei, said excitedly, "After returning to school, we will study hard and dedicate ourselves to the country's marine affairs upon graduation."

On a certain warship that was awarded a collective second-class merit for its role in the March 14th naval battle, the university students experienced the hardships of the soldiers' lives. They witnessed their peers' ardent training to defend the motherland. The students presented a banner to the sailors that read, "South China Sea Spirit, Shaking the Coastal Region."

　　中国人民大学学生代表到南海    
    与执行南沙任务官兵共度春节
    据新华社海口２月９日电  （通讯员陈盛、傅扬）寒假期间，中国人民大学学生代表２９人千里迢迢从北京来到南海舰队，和执行南沙任务的官兵共度新春佳节。
    大学生们到部队后，深入海岛、舰艇、医院，慰问正在执行南沙任务的海军指战员，了解南沙的地理概况、物质资源等情况。在某基地召开的座谈会上，学校团委书记王伟激动地说：“回校后，我们一定刻苦学习，毕业后献身国家海洋事业。”在“３·１４”海战中荣立集体二等功的某军舰上，大学生们体验了官兵的艰苦生活，目睹了同龄人为保卫祖国刻苦训练的火热场景。他们向水兵赠送了绣有“南海军魂，威震海疆”的锦旗。
