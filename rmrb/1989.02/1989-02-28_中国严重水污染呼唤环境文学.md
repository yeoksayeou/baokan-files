	China's severe water pollution urgently calls for the development of environmental literature. The reportage "China's Water Pollution" by writer Liu Guixian was published in the second issue of "March Wind" this year. The work reveals a shocking reality: almost every place in China with water sources and human habitation is polluted. The country discharges 34.9 billion tons of wastewater annually, with economic losses due to water pollution amounting to 4.34 billion yuan each year. It is estimated that by the year 2000, even with controls in place, the annual industrial wastewater discharge will still reach 50 billion tons, and urban domestic sewage will amount to 20 billion tons. Surface water is severely polluted, and groundwater is also seriously polluted, with excessive and over-extraction. More than 20 cities are silently sinking, and local disputes over pollution are not uncommon.

	China's reality urgently needs more writers to engage in environmental literature, helping people to raise their environmental awareness. Recently, "March Wind" magazine and "China Environmental News" held a discussion meeting on "China's Water Pollution." Participants affirmed the role of works on environmental issues published in recent years in promoting societal awareness, but they also felt that such works are still too few. There is an urgent need for a large number of writers to strive for the development of environmental literature.

　　中国严重水污染呼唤环境文学
    本报讯  作家刘贵贤的报告文学《中国的水污染》发表在《三月风》今年第二期，作品展示的现实触目惊心：中国凡是有水源有人居住的地方，几乎都有污染。全国每年废水排放量达３４９亿吨，每年因水污染造成的经济损失为４３４亿元。预计公元２０００年，如果加以控制，全国工业废水排放量仍达５００亿吨，城市生活污水为２００亿吨。地表水严重污染，地下水也污染严重，且过量超采，２０多个城市悄悄下沉，因污染造成的局部械斗事件时有发生……
    中国的现实迫切需要更多的作家投入环境文学的写作，帮助人们提高环保意识。不久前，《三月风》杂志、《中国环境报》召开《中国的水污染》讨论会，与会者肯定了近年写环境问题的作品对社会的推动作用，但仍感这方面的作品太少，急需一大批作家为发展环境文学而努力。
