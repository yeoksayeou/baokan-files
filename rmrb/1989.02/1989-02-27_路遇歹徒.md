	Encountering Thugs on the Road
	On November 10, 1988, at 1 p.m., I bought a ticket to Luoyang at the Zhengzhou long-distance bus station. When boarding the bus, due to the crowded passengers, my black imitation leather bag was cut open by a thief in two large slits. Fortunately, I did not put my money in the bag, so the thief got nothing.

	On December 9, 1988, I went to Luoyang, Henan, on a second business trip. When the public bus passed through the jurisdiction of Gong County, six young men and women boarded the bus, each holding a knife. They openly searched the passengers' pockets. One of the thugs forcibly took a few yuan from the pocket of an elderly man in his 50s and threatened the old man, saying that if he did not give the money, he would stab him. The thug ordered the driver to stop the car and threatened to pull the old man off the car. The driver did not stop the car, and the thug slapped the old man a few times before stopping. Since the thugs appeared in groups and were armed, the passengers did not dare to speak up. After the thugs got off the bus, according to the public bus ticket seller, these thugs were all familiar to him. The thugs did not harm the driver and the ticket seller, but they never bought tickets when they rode the bus. A passenger next to me said, "On long-distance public buses, thieves form gangs, use knives to search and rob passengers, and this happens almost every day. Robbed passengers dare not speak up, as speaking up puts their lives in danger."

	On December 16, 1988, I took a public bus back to Zhengzhou from Jia County. When the bus reached Yu County, a few people got off the bus. A passenger on the bus said in relief, "'Pinch' (referring to thieves) did not strike today." The ticket seller said, "The person who just got off the bus wearing a yellow coat is a thief."

	Since the thugs have a pattern of committing crimes on the bus, the police should be able to catch them. Someone should be responsible for this kind of incident in the local area.

　　路遇歹徒
    １９８８年１１月１０日下午一点，我在郑州长途汽车站买了去洛阳的车票。上车时，由于旅客拥挤，我的黑人造革提包被小偷割了两个大口子。庆幸的是，我没有把钱装进提包内，小偷一无所获。
    １９８８年１２月９日，第二次出差去河南洛阳，公共汽车经过巩县境时，车上上来６个青年男女，手持匕首，公开地搜旅客们的口袋。一个歹徒强行从一个５０多岁的老人口袋里掏出仅有的几块钱，并威胁老人说，不给钱就一刀捅了他。歹徒要司机停车，扬言把那位老人拉下车去，司机没有停车，歹徒打了老人几个耳光才算罢休。由于歹徒是以团伙出现的，又手持凶器，旅客们都不敢吭声。歹徒们下了车后，据公共汽车售票员讲：这些歹徒他都认识。歹徒不伤害司机和售票员，但他们乘车从不买票。我身边一位旅客对我说：“在长途公共汽车上，小偷结成团伙，持刀对旅客搜身抢劫的事已经是常事了，几乎天天都有。被劫旅客不敢声张，声张有性命危险。”
    １９８８年１２月１６日，我乘公共汽车从郏县返回郑州。车到禹县时，从车上下去了几个人。车上一位旅客庆幸地说：“‘钳工’（指小偷）今天没发市。”售票员说：“刚才下车的那个穿黄大衣的就是小偷。”
    既然歹徒在车上作案有规律可循，公安人员完全有把握抓住他们。对这类事，当地应该有人管。
