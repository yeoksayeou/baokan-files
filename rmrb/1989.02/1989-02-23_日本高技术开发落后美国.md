In the development of cutting-edge technologies for new industries, Japan lags behind the United States. This is the conclusion drawn from a recent survey conducted by the Japanese Economic News Agency, which polled over 300 accomplished Japanese researchers.

The survey results indicate that in 47 high-tech areas, including high-temperature superconductivity, optoelectronic components, and high-performance robots, the United States currently leads in 45 of them. By the year 2000, the U.S. is expected to maintain a dominant lead in 44 of these projects. Japan, on the other hand, currently holds an advantage in robot technology and high-magnetic materials. By the year 2000, Japan may be on par with the U.S. in 7 of these projects.

　　日本高技术开发落后美国
    据新华社东京２月２１日电  在新产业的最尖端技术开发方面，日本落后于美国。这是日本经济新闻社最近对３００多名有成就的日本研究人员进行调查后得出的结论。
    调查结果表明，在高温超导、光元件、高性能机器人等４７项高技术中，美国目前有４５项领先，到２０００年也可保持４４个项目的压倒优势。而日本目前在机器人技术和强磁性材料方面有优势，到２０００年时可能在７个项目上与美国并驾齐驱。
