Soviet athlete Bubka today vaulted over a 6.03-meter-high bar at an international indoor track and field meet in Osaka, Japan, setting a new indoor pole vault world record.

The competition was held at Osaka Castle Gymnasium. After clearing 5.80 meters, Bubka had already secured the championship and immediately requested that the bar be raised by 23 centimeters to challenge the 6.02-meter world record. After failing in his first two attempts, Bubka successfully cleared the 6.03-meter bar on his third try. He then attempted to challenge his own outdoor pole vault world record of 6.06 meters by raising the bar to 6.10 meters. However, he failed in all three attempts.

The previous indoor pole vault world record was set by Soviet athlete Radion Gataullin just seven days ago in Moscow.

　　布勃卡创室内撑竿跳高世界纪录
    新华社东京２月１１日电  （记者姚力）苏联选手布勃卡今天在日本大阪举行的国际室内田径赛上跳过６米０３高的横杆，刷新了室内撑竿跳高世界纪录。
    这次比赛在大阪城体育馆举行。布勃卡在跳过５米８０后已稳获冠军，并立即要求把横杆增高２３厘米，向６米０２的世界纪录冲击。在前两次试跳失败后，布勃卡第三次试跳轻松地跃过６米０３的横杆。此后他曾试图冲击自己保持的６米０６的室外撑竿跳高世界纪录，将横杆升到６米１０的高度。但他３次试跳都未成功。原室内撑竿跳高世界纪录是苏联选手拉季翁·加陶林７天前在莫斯科创造的。
