Iran Team's Ferocious Attack Defeats Thailand Team 3-0

According to Xinhua News Agency in Bangkok on February 23, (reporter Zhang Qiu Lai) the Iran team won 3-0 against the Thailand team in the fifth group match of the Asian zone of the World Cup football tournament held here tonight.

The match was in the 19th minute when the Iran team launched a swift attack from the right side. The ball was passed twice and arrived at the front of the Thailand team's goal. Karim Bavi, who was lying in wait in front of the Thailand team's goal, headed the ball into the net successfully. Then, in the 28th minute of the match, Sirus Gayelang of the Iran team got the ball about 20 meters in front of the Thailand team's goal and shot a powerful shot, sending the ball directly into the net. At the end of the first half, the Iran team led 2-0.

In the second half, the Thailand team fought desperately to reverse the situation. Under the organization of the famous player Bepong Bevin, they launched a counterattack, but due to excessive individual dribbling in the back and midfield, the speed of the attack was slow, allowing the Iran team to retreat to the goal in a relaxed manner. In the final 2 minutes of the match, the Iran team launched an attack from the right side, and Muhsan Garusi scored a goal about 5 meters in front of the Thailand team's goal.

　　伊朗队攻势凌厉胜泰国队三球
    据新华社曼谷２月２３日电  （记者张秋来）伊朗队今晚在这里举行的世界杯足球赛亚洲区第五组比赛中，以３∶０战胜泰国队。
    比赛进行到第十九分钟时，伊朗队从右路发起快速进攻，球二传三传就到了泰国队大门前，埋伏在泰国队球门前的卡里姆·巴维头球攻门成功。接着，在比赛进行到第二十八分钟时，伊朗队的西鲁斯·加耶格兰在泰国队球门前约２０多米处得球，大脚冷射，球直飞网内。上半时，伊朗队以２∶０领先。
    下半时，泰国队拚命想挽回败局，在著名球星别蓬·贝温的组织下进行反击，但由于后场和中场个人盘带过多，造成进攻的速度不快，使伊朗队可以从容退守门前。在比赛终场前２分钟，伊朗队从右路发起的一次进攻中，由穆赫桑·加鲁西在泰国队大门前约五米处得球后射门破网。
