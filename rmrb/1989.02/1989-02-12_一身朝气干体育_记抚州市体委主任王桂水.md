Full of Vitality in Sports – A Profile of Wang Guishui, Director of the Sports Commission of Fuzhou City

Wang Guishui stands at 1.8 meters tall, weighs 98 kilograms, and has a robust build, resembling an iron tower. He attributes his entry into the Jiangxi Institute of Physical Education in 1958 to his physique and boundless energy. His specialty was the hammer throw. Despite his best efforts, he never achieved significant results.

Ten years later, he transitioned from the 2.13-meter diameter hammer throw circle to the Fuzhou Sports Commission, taking on the responsibilities of a sports official and the training of reserve athletes. In just a few years, Fuzhou successfully supplied several outstanding athletes, including Hu Gang, Luo Jun, and Wang Jun, to national teams. To this day, as the director of the Sports Commission, he remains passionate about the hammer throw. Every afternoon, he continues to train athletes at the track and field stadium, hoping to cultivate a reserve athlete who can break the 80-meter barrier for Jiangxi.

Some people are amazed by his bold claims, while others admire his grand vision. He says, "Since Jiangxi athletes have already broken the 70-meter barrier, the 80-meter mark is our next goal. This isn't an empty boast. Do we have to stand still and do nothing?"

When it comes to vision, Wang Guishui has a grand plan for the development of sports in Fuzhou. In recent years, his work in enterprises, particularly the sports federation, has become a driving force for mass sports, paving a new path for social sports development. Factory directors say, "In the past, Wang would come to us for sports activities. Now, we come to him with people, money, and resources." In 1986, he successfully organized the National Men's and Women's Field Hockey Championships with the support of social forces, causing a significant stir in the region.

When residents of Fuzhou talk about the 80-acre sports center, they marvel at the standard track and field stadium, training hall, tennis courts, weightlifting room, and the 3,000-seat gymnasium that have sprung up on the open land. They say, "Director Wang is like a sports magician, he's so skilled."

In reality, for that sports facility, over the course of a decade, he was like a night wanderer, constantly circling the muddy pond and foul-smelling ditches in the southern part of the city. Through his efforts, he developed a comprehensive plan for the construction of sports facilities in Fuzhou City. The first step was to fill 140,000 cubic meters of soil, which alone would cost 700,000 yuan at the time. When the plan was proposed, everyone was astonished, saying there was no way to find so much money for moving soil. He suggested to the government: "Don't use municipal funds, and don't ask the people to contribute, but mobilize the entire population of the city to volunteer, with each person contributing three cubic meters of soil." With the support of the municipal government, from the municipal party secretary and mayor down to street residents, the entire city mobilized, carrying and wheeling the soil in shifts. It took three whole months to create a vast, level sports field in the heart of Fuzhou City. Today, it has become a hub for the public to exercise, as well as for sports, cultural, and assembly activities.

　　一身朝气干体育
     ——记抚州市体委主任王桂水
    王桂水身高１．８米，体重９８公斤，长得虎头虎脑，像尊铁塔。他说他是凭着自己的块头和那身使不完的力气，１９５８年闯进了江西体育学院，专业就是旋转链球。虽然费尽了九牛二虎之力，仍没掷出啥名堂。
    十年后，他从２．１３米直径的链球投掷圈小天地来到抚州体委，一肩顶着体委负责人的重任，一肩挑着教练员培养后备人才的担子。几年时间，抚州竟然接二连三为优秀运动队输送了胡刚、罗军、王军几员全国拔尖的后备人才。时至目下，他身为体委主任，仍然念念不忘那个沉甸甸的链球，每天下午还坚持到田径场训练体校运动员，继续发挥他的专业，恨不得为江西培养出闯８０米大关的链球后备人才。
    对此，有人惊讶他“口气好大”，也有人佩服他“气魄很大”。他说，我们江西运动员既已突破链球７０米大关，８０米自然成了我们下一个目标。这不是大话，难道要我们江西原地踏步不成？
    说到气魄，王桂水还有着一个发展抚州体育的宏大计划。这两年他在企业里搞的那个联合体协，就像群众体育一个龙头，带动全市体育活动转，称得上社会办体育的一条新路子。厂长们说：“过去搞体育，王主任上门来找我们，现在我们出人出钱出物上门找王主任。”１９８６年他依靠社会力量成功地承办了全国男女曲棍球锦标赛，在此地引起了不小的轰动。
    抚州市的群众说起那个占地８０亩的体育中心，瞅着那片开阔地上的标准田径场、训练馆、网球场、举重房以及３０００个座位的体育馆拔地而起，都说：“王主任像个体育魔术师，好会变。”
    其实，为了那片体育场地，十年间他像是个夜游神，老是围着城南那片烂泥塘、臭水沟的低洼地打转转，转来转去脑子里转出一个全面规划抚州市体育场地的建设方案。这个方案第一步就是要填１４万立方土，光搬土方这一项当时就要７０万元。方案一提出，谁听了谁咂舌，都说哪有那么多钱来搬土。他向政府建议：不要市财政的钱，也不要群众掏腰包，但要全市人民群众出把力，义务劳动，每人三方土。在市政府的支持下，上至地委书记、专员，下至街道居民，全市出动，人挑肩扛，轮换作战，整整花了三个月时间，一大片平平整整的体育场地伸展在抚州市区。如今，那里已成为群众锻炼身体和体育、文艺、集会等的集散中心。
