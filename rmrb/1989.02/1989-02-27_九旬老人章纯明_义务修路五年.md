Shaoshan Village has a 90-year-old widower, Zhang Chunming, who has volunteered to repair roads for over five years. The Communist Party Secretary of Hunan Province, Xiong Qingquan, specially named the road he repaired as "Zhang's Road."

In 1984, the elderly man, who was already over eighty, noticed that the 3-kilometer road leading to Shaoshan Peak was severely damaged by rainwater, making it inconvenient for domestic and international tourists to visit Chairman Mao's former residence and climb Shaoshan Peak to watch the sunrise. Therefore, he took on the responsibility of repairing the road voluntarily.

　　九旬老人章纯明
    义务修路五年
    据新华社长沙２月２６日电  （通讯员肖跃华）韶山冲９０岁的孤寡老人章纯明义务修路５年多，湖南省委书记熊清泉特命名他修的这条路为“章公路”。
    １９８４年，已年逾八旬的老人发现春夏之交通往韶峰的３公里多的山路路面被雨水冲洗，坑坑洼洼，瞻仰毛主席旧居，登韶峰观日出的海内外游人十分不便，于是义务挑起了修路重任。
