The Thinker and Society – Liu Zai Fu Returns from Sweden to Talk About the Nobel Prize
By Li Hui

Embrace Art and Humanity with Passion
Reporter: Please talk more about the attitude of thinkers toward society.

Liu: Thinkers and society should have a relationship of mutual respect and mutual concern. Last November, before I left, I mentioned that post-World War II Nobel laureates have a terminal concern for human destiny. "Terminal concern" is a religious concept. I want to use this concept to illustrate that scientists and writers have a genuine concern for society, not just for a particular time, place, or event, but for the present and future of humanity, with a sincere worry and concern. For example, Einstein, when he knew that his country was developing the atomic bomb, wrote a letter to U.S. President Roosevelt; and when Germany surrendered and the U.S. dropped the atomic bomb on Japan, he protested to the U.S. This is because his belief was that science should benefit humanity.

Reporter: Does this year's laureate, the Egyptian writer Mahfouz, also have a concern for society?

Liu: He once said that he writes only to buy high-heeled shoes for his two daughters, of course, this is a joke. In fact, he is a writer who is full of emotion for society. Great writers have two characteristics: one is to embrace art passionately and wholeheartedly, and the other is to embrace society passionately and wholeheartedly. Of course, their concern for society is not generalized, but with an independent mind and unique deep affection to concern society, and to contribute unique creative achievements to society.

Reporter: Can your words be understood in two ways: one is that writers should sincerely love art and not be disturbed by factors outside of art; the other is that writers should express their concern for human progress and destiny through their love for art and the creation of art.

Liu: Yes. Lu Xun once criticized those who use art as a stepping stone. Such people do not embrace art wholeheartedly and naturally cannot create truly great works, let alone embrace society and humanity. Due to historical reasons, Chinese writers often face various interferences outside of art. Those who truly regard literature as a lifelong pursuit are not many. If one does not embrace art wholeheartedly, one naturally lacks the perseverance in artistic pursuit and is easily distracted by struggles outside of art. However, writers cannot hide in an ivory tower of art and be absolutely indifferent to society. Such indifference will gradually freeze their wisdom. Mahfouz, due to old age and illness, was unable to attend the award ceremony, and his speech was read by someone else. He did not express his feelings for society in a general way, but expressed them very strongly and movingly. Among them, his appeal to the leaders of rich countries was particularly moving. He said: "Today, the greatness of the leaders of civilization should be measured by their foresight and sense of responsibility for all humanity." He even directly shouted: Save the enslaved people in southern Africa! Save the refugees in Africa! A writer from a poor country, if he adopts escapism towards society, will always be constrained and condemned by his conscience.

Reporter: Mahfouz is from a poor country. How does he overcome pessimistic emotions and persist in his artistic creation?

Liu: Mahfouz said he has a firm belief in human society, that the power of good is ultimately stronger than the power of evil. In addition to his belief in humanity, he also has a firm belief in truth. He said that a story from the Pharaoh civilization enlightened him: one day the pyramids will disappear from the earth, but truth and justice will exist for a long time, just like the human mind that loves to contemplate and conscience that is eternal. It is precisely because of this that he has a firm belief in art. He said that art is generous and full of sympathy, it belongs to those who are full of joy, and it does not abandon those who are miserable. These beliefs make him an optimist.

Reporter: "The Thinker and Society" may have endless topics to discuss. I hope to hear more of your thoughts in the future. Thank you. (To be continued)

### 思想者与社会——刘再复瑞典归来谈诺贝尔奖

　　思想者与社会
　　——刘再复瑞典归来谈诺贝尔奖
　　李辉
    热烈地拥抱艺术、拥抱人类
    记者：请再谈谈思想者对社会的态度。
    刘：思想者与社会之间，两者应当是互相尊重、互相关怀的。我在去年１１月临行之前曾说，二次大战后的获奖作家都对人类命运有一种终极性的关怀。“终极关怀”是一个宗教性的概念。我想借此概念说明，科学家、作家对社会的关怀，不仅着眼于一时一地一事，而且对人类的现在和将来，有一种真诚的忧虑与关怀。例如爱因斯坦，当他知道他的祖国正在制造原子弹时，便写信告诉美国总统罗斯福；而当德国投降后，美国在日本投下原子弹时，他又向美国提出抗议，这是因为他的信念只有一个：科学应当造福于人类。
    记者：这次获奖的埃及作家马哈福兹是否也很关怀社会？
    刘：他说过他写作只是为了让两个女儿买双高跟鞋，当然这是开玩笑的话。其实，他是一个对社会充满感情的作家。大作家都有两个特点，一是热烈地、全身心地拥抱艺术，一是热烈地、全身心地拥抱社会。当然，他们对社会的关怀不是一般化的，而是以独立的心灵和独异的深情去关怀社会，并奉献给社会以独特的创造成果。
    记者：您的话是否可以理解为两层意思：一是作家要真诚地热爱艺术，不必为艺术之外的因素干扰；一是作家以热爱艺术和创造艺术的途径来体现对人类进步和命运的关注。
    刘：是的。鲁迅曾经批评过有的人只是把艺术当作敲门砖，这样的人就不是全身心拥抱艺术，自然也不可能创造出真正伟大的作品，更谈不上拥抱社会和人类了。由于历史的原因，我国作家常受到艺术之外的种种干扰，真正把文学当作坚贞不渝、终身追求的事业的人并不多。如果未能全身心地拥抱艺术，就自然缺少艺术追求的韧性，就容易把智慧浪费在艺术之外的争斗之中。但是，作家决不可能躲在艺术的象牙之塔而对社会绝对冷漠，这种冷漠将使作家的智慧逐步冻结。马哈福兹因年迈有病未能出席颁奖仪式，他的演讲是请人宣读的。他不是一般地表达出对社会的感情，而是很强烈、很动人地表达出来的。其中他对富国领袖的呼吁尤其动人。他说：“今天，文明领导人的伟大，其衡量标准应该是具有远见卓识，对全人类怀有责任感。”他甚至直接呐喊：拯救非洲南部受奴役的人！拯救非洲的灾民！一个身处穷国的作家，如果对社会采取逃避主义，总是要受到良知的牵制和谴责。
    记者：马哈福兹身处穷国，他是怎样排除悲观情绪，坚持他的艺术创作的？
    刘：马哈福兹说他对人类社会有一种坚定的信念，即善的力量毕竟比恶的力量更加强大。除了对人类的信念之外，他对真理也充满信念，他说，法老文明中一个故事启示他：总有一天金字塔会从地上消失，但真理和公正将会长久地存在，就像人类爱沉思的头脑和良知一样天长地久。正是如此，他对艺术也充满信念，他说艺术是慷慨而富有同情心的，它既属于充满欢乐的人，也不抛弃悲惨的人。这些信念使他成为一个乐观主义者。
    记者：“思想者与社会”可能有谈不完的话题，希望有机会再听听您的思考。谢谢。（下）
