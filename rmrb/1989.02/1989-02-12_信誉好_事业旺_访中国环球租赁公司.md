A joint venture of three countries and six parties, the China Global Leasing Company recently distributed $1 million in dividends and expanded investments by $1 million, becoming a leader in China's international leasing industry. The partners and users are all satisfied, and people say it has started on the right path and chosen the correct direction.

What is their secret? Let's start with one example:

First and Second

A prominent frame reads, "Control Dust Pollution, Benefit the People," sent to the Global Leasing Company. This is a token of appreciation from one of China's 22 key asbestos product manufacturers, the Shenyang Asbestos Processing Plant. Workers who have suffered from dust pollution for over 30 years can now work comfortably in bright workshops. They will never forget the company's timely help. The old factory originally used dry processing, with dust everywhere. 53% of the workers suffered from silicosis. Workers' hardships are self-evident, and nearby residents were also affected. The Shenyang municipal government decided to relocate and upgrade the factory, changing from dry to wet processing. However, due to a lack of funds, the project almost came to a halt. The factory sent representatives to seek help from the Global Leasing Company. The company arranged $1.5 million in financing within three days to lease advanced equipment, and also reduced the handling fee by half. Although the economic benefits for the company were not significant, the social benefits were good. A company official said, "The earlier the renovation, the earlier people can be saved." They not only saved people but also helped the factory's production to develop and begin exporting.

The company's principle is: make small profits but do many deals, prioritize social benefits first, and company benefits second. They have successively introduced textile, packaging, and petrochemical equipment for the Huaihai Economic Zone, Jilin, Guizhou, and many other provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions. The Shijiazhuang Cotton Mill No. 6 had been using outdated equipment. "Global" introduced a denim production line worth $6 million. In 1987, it began trial production, with an annual foreign exchange earnings potential of $20 million. The president of an American high-end jeans company, after visiting the factory, said, "Your factory's equipment is world-class." For minority areas, remote areas, and labor protection projects, they offer the most favorable treatment, even seeking only to break even without profit.

"Three Don'ts" and "Three Matches"

Should a ripe fruit be eaten? Some clients requested help in importing color TVs, polyester chips, and Australian wool, all of which could make a lot of money. Should they do it? After internal discussions, the company decided that using state foreign exchange to earn RMB does not align with the company's goals and should not be done. A certain province wanted to import steel through "Global." The company persuaded them to adhere to the principle of unified external negotiations and entrusted the professional China Minmetals Corporation to negotiate the import. They established the principle of "three don'ts": not engaging in commercial imports of raw materials, market goods, and high-end consumer products.

Over the past four years, they have signed over 700 leasing contracts without finding any that violate policies. They say the key is to choose the right projects and not cause trouble. They have always adhered to the principle of "three matches": financing leasing should align with macro-control, align with the local development guidelines, and align with the local annual plan arrangements. A company official who recently returned from investigations in Jiangsu and Shandong said: There is no need to worry that rectification and adjustment will affect leasing business. As long as it aligns with the national policy of adjusting the industrial structure, there are still many projects in petroleum, coal, electricity, transportation, and so on.

Compare Three Goods, Compare Three Currencies

There is a saying, "Compare three goods to avoid loss, compare three currencies for more benefits." Those in trade cannot ignore currency; those in banking cannot ignore trade.

The washing machine factories in Wuxi, Yingkou, and Dalian commissioned "Global" to lease equipment from Italy using financing. The Italian side quoted prices in Deutsche Marks. "Global" studied and compared the trends of the US dollar, Deutsche Mark, and international financial market conditions, and suggested to the users to sign the contract in US dollars. Indeed, the Deutsche Mark remained strong, and the US dollar weakened, saving the three users a total of $105.1 million. A Chinese official from "Global" said, "The development of commodity economy, the integration of bank funds and industrial funds, and the combination of banking, trade, and industry are inevitable trends." "Global" fully utilizes this advantage, strives to provide users with preferential interest rates, selects high-quality and low-cost technical equipment, acts as a good consultant for users, helps them choose the right currency, and makes users clear-sighted, avoiding harm and seeking benefits.

Some foreign colleagues once did not understand: running a business is to make more money, why do Chinese friends always put social benefits first and company benefits second, why emphasize making small profits but doing many deals.

Four years of achievements and joint work with Chinese friends have gradually made them understand: this is a far-sighted approach, it makes the company gain a good reputation. A good reputation leads to a prosperous business.

### 信誉好　事业旺——访中国环球租赁公司

　　信誉好　事业旺
    ——访中国环球租赁公司
    本报记者  计泓赓
    一家三国六方合资的国际租赁公司，不久前分红１００万美元，扩大投资１００万美元，成为我国国际租赁行业中的佼佼者，这就是刚满四岁的中国环球租赁公司，合资各方满意，用户满意。人们说它起步正，路子对。
    他们的诀窍是什么？先从一件事谈起：
    　　　　第一和第二
    一个醒目的镜框：“治理尘害，造福人民”送到环球租赁公司。这是我国２２家石棉制品重点生产厂家之一沈阳石棉加工厂的一点心意。饱受了３０多年尘毒之苦的职工，如今已在敞亮的车间舒心地干活，他们怎么也忘不了环球公司的雪里送炭。这家老厂原来是干法加工，粉尘弥漫，５３％工人患矽肺病。工人干活苦自不待言，附近居民也遭殃。沈阳市府决定搬迁治理，改干法为湿法生产。可因资金短缺，工程几乎停顿。工厂派人到环球公司求援。公司在３天内即为其融资１５０万元租赁先进设备，还把手续费减了一半。对公司来说经济效益虽不大，但社会效益好。公司一位负责人说，救人项目，改造越早，救人越早。他们不但救了人，工厂生产也发展了，并开始有出口。
    环球租赁公司的信条是：薄利多做，社会效益第一，公司利益第二。他们先后为淮海经济区、吉林、贵州等不少省、市、自治区引进了纺织、包装、石油化工等设备。石家庄棉纺六厂设备一直超期服役，“环球”为其引进了价值６００万美元的牛仔布生产线。１９８７年投入试生产，年创汇可达２０００万美元。美国一家生产高档牛仔裤公司的总裁到厂参观后说：“贵厂设备堪称世界一流。”对少数民族地区、边远地区和劳保项目，他们给以最优惠待遇，甚至只求保本，不求盈利。
    　　　　“三不做”与“三合拍”
    送到嘴边的果子吃不吃？有些客户要求帮助进口彩电、聚脂切片、澳毛，这些都可赚大钱，做不做？公司内部讨论后认为，耗国家外汇赚取人民币，不符合公司的宗旨，不能做。某省想通过“环球”进口钢材，公司说服他们坚持统一对外的原则，委托专业的五矿进出口公司谈判进口。他们定下了“三不做”的原则：凡商业性进口原材物料、市场物资和高档消费品的业务，一概不做。
    ４年来，他们签订的７００多项租赁合同，还没有发现一项违背政策的。他们说，关键是要选准项目，不帮倒忙。他们一直坚持“三合拍”的原则，即融资租赁要与宏观调控合拍，与地方发展的指导思想合拍，与地方当年计划安排合拍。春节前刚从江苏、山东调查回来的公司负责人说：不用担心整顿、治理会影响租赁业务，只要与国家调整产业结构政策合拍，石油、煤、电、交通等等要上的项目还多得很哩。
    　　　　货比三家　币比三种
    有道是，货比三家不吃亏，币比三种好处多。搞贸易的，不能不研究货币；搞银行的，不能不研究贸易。
    无锡、营口、大连洗衣机厂委托“环球”为其从意大利融资租赁设备，意方用西德马克报价。“环球”研究比较了美元、马克币值走向和国际金融市场行情，建议用户折成美元签约，果然马克坚挺，美元疲软，一条建议使三家用户总共节省了１０５．１万美元。“环球”一位中方负责人说，商品经济的发展，银行资金和产业资金溶合，银、贸、工的结合，是必然趋势。“环球”就是充分利用这种优势，努力为用户提供优惠利率的资金，物色优质价廉的技术装备，当好用户参谋，帮助选准货币，使用户心明眼亮，避害趋利。
    有的外方人员曾经不理解，办企业就是要多赚钱，为什么中国朋友老是要把社会效益放第一，公司利益放第二，为什么要强调薄利多做。
    ４年的实绩和与中国朋友的共同工作，使他们慢慢领悟了：这是有远见的做法，它使公司赢得了信誉。信誉好则事业旺。
