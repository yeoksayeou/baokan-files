The Lunar New Year has just passed, and the price of eggs in the Shenyang market has been falling repeatedly, making it difficult for poultry farmers to bear. On February 21, the Shenyang municipal government decided to implement a protective pricing system for egg purchases.

Last year, the supply of eggs in Shenyang was approximately 40 million kilograms, which was enough to meet the local demand. After the Lunar New Year, the price of eggs in the market continued to drop. By the 15th day of the first lunar month (February 20), the price of eggs in major agricultural markets fell from 4.80 yuan per kilogram during the Lunar New Year to 4.00 yuan per kilogram. There was also a trend of further price declines, leading some farmers to cull their laying hens. To protect the interests of producers, the Shenyang municipal government promptly decided to implement a protective pricing system for egg purchases starting from February 21, setting the price at 3.80 yuan per kilogram.

　　价市一再下跌　农民难以承受
    沈阳用保护价收购鸡蛋
    据新华社沈阳２月２４日电  春节刚过，沈阳市场上鸡蛋价格一跌再跌，养鸡农民难以承受。沈阳市政府于２月２１日决定，将对鸡蛋实行保护价收购。
    去年沈阳市鸡蛋上市量为４０００万公斤左右，地产鸡蛋已能满足本市需要。春节一过，市场上鸡蛋价格不断下跌。到正月十五（２月２０日），各大农贸市场鸡蛋价格由春节期间的每公斤４．８０元降到４．００元。而且有继续下跌的趋势，致使少数农民出现杀生蛋母鸡的现象。为了保护生产者的利益，沈阳市政府及时做出决定从２月２１日起，实行鸡蛋保护价收购，每公斤为３．８０元。
