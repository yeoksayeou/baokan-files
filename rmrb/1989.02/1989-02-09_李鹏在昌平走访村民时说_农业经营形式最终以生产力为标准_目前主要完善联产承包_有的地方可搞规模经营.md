Li Peng visits villagers in Changping and says that agricultural management forms should ultimately be judged by productivity standards. Currently, the main focus is on improving the household contract responsibility system, and in some places, it is possible to implement large-scale management.

On the third day of the Lunar New Year, Premier Li Peng visited the village of Machikou in Beijing's Changping County to greet the farmers and have a discussion with them. Li Peng shared several opinions on rural work during the discussion.

Accompanying Li Peng were Beijing Municipal Party Secretary Li Ximing and Mayor Chen Xitong. Also present were State Councilors Zhou Jiahu and Chen Junsheng, State Council Secretary Rong Gan, and Minister of Agriculture He Kang. Li Peng's wife, Zhu Lin, also joined in the New Year greetings.

At ten o'clock this morning, Li Peng visited two farmers' homes in Machikou Village, wishing them a happy New Year and inquiring about their living and working conditions.

Later, Li Peng held a discussion with the village's party secretary, village committee chairman, farm workers, and labor models, totaling more than ten people. Village Party Secretary Zuo Quan introduced that Machikou Village has 906 farming households with 1,174 laborers, of whom 900 are engaged in off-farm work and 164 in farming. Li Peng asked with concern, "Can 100 people manage over 3,000 mu of grain fields?" Zuo Quan replied, "Our village practices moderate-scale management for grain production, mainly using mechanized production, which has a high labor efficiency. Last year, the total grain output reached 230,400 kilograms, with an average yield of nearly 700 kilograms per mu."

After the discussion, Li Peng shared several opinions on rural work.

He said that the main focus nationwide should be on improving the household contract responsibility system, which aligns with China's current level of productive forces. In places like Machikou Village, where moderate-scale management has proven effective, it can also be developed. The form of management should ultimately be judged by whether it promotes the development of productive forces. We welcome any form that promotes the development of productive forces.

Regarding the grain issue, Li Peng pointed out that China is a country with a population of one billion. Currently, the per capita grain availability is less than 400 kilograms. Not only do people need grain to eat, but the conversion of feed, aquaculture, and livestock farming also require grain. Therefore, grain production must be ensured. To develop grain production, we need to rely on policies, agricultural investment, and scientific and technological progress. Developing collective economies in rural areas is beneficial for increasing agricultural investment.

Li Peng discussed township enterprises, saying that they need to be further developed and consolidated. During this year's rectification and reorganization period, township enterprises may face difficulties such as insufficient power supply, raw material shortages, and financial constraints. Township enterprises should use this opportunity to adjust their product structure, improve product quality, increase labor productivity, reduce costs, and enhance their competitiveness. In the long term, township enterprises should focus on developing processing industries that use local raw materials, particularly livestock farming, grain processing, and feed industries.

Finally, Li Peng expressed his hopes for the construction of spiritual civilization in rural areas. He said that now that farmers' living standards have improved, they have food, clothing, and housing. However, people will have higher demands. They will need cultural life, so it is essential to strengthen the construction of spiritual civilization in rural areas to make farmers' lives more colorful and fulfilling.

Li Peng also visited Changping County to greet commercial workers who were on duty.

　　李鹏在昌平走访村民时说
　　农业经营形式最终以生产力为标准
　　目前主要完善联产承包　有的地方可搞规模经营
    新华社北京二月八日电  （中央人民广播电台记者庞际昌、新华社记者倪小林）大年初三，国务院总理李鹏来到北京昌平县马池口村看望农民，给他们拜年，在和村民们座谈时，李鹏谈了对农村工作的几点意见。
    陪同李鹏总理前往的有北京市委书记李锡铭、市长陈希同。随行的还有国务委员邹家华、陈俊生，国务院秘书长罗干、农业部长何康等。李鹏总理夫人朱琳也一起去拜年。
    今天上午十点，李鹏总理来到了马池口村到两户农民家里做客，向他们祝贺新春，并询问了他们的生活劳动情况。
    接着，李鹏总理和这个村的党委书记、村民委员会主任、农场农民、劳动模范共十余人进行座谈。村党委书记左权向客人们介绍说，马池口村共有农户九百零六户，一千一百七十四名劳动力，其中务工劳力九百人，务农劳力一百六十四人。李鹏总理十分关心地问道：“一百多人种三千多亩粮田行吗？”左权回客：“我们村粮食生产实行的适度规模经营，主要采用机械化生产，劳动效率比较高，去年粮食总产达到了二百三十点四万公斤，平均亩产近七百公斤。”
    座谈后，李鹏总理谈了对农村工作的几点意见。
    他说，农业问题就全国范围来讲，主要还是完善家庭联产承包责任制，这符合我国当前生产力发展水平。在像马池口村这样的地方，经过实践证明搞适度规模经营效果好，也可以发展适度规模经营。搞什么形式，最终以生产力是否发展为标准，促进生产力发展的，我们就欢迎。
    谈到粮食问题时，李鹏总理指出，我国是十亿人口的大国，现在人均占有粮食已经不足四百公斤，不但人民要吃粮，副食品转换，水产、饲养都需要粮食。因此，一定要注意粮食的生产。要发展粮食生产，一靠政策，二靠农业投入，三靠科学技术。发展农村集体经济对增加农业投入是有利的。
    李鹏总理谈到乡镇企业时说，乡镇企业要进一步发展巩固。在今年的治理、整顿期间，乡镇企业可能会遇到电力供应、原材料不足、资金紧张等困难。乡镇企业应当利用这个机会，调整产品结构、提高产品质量、提高劳动生产率、降低成本、提高企业的竞争能力。从长远看，乡镇企业要注意发展县、乡自有原料的加工业，尤其是养殖业、原粮加工、饲料工业等。
    最后，李鹏总理还对农村精神文明建设寄予希望。他说，现在农民生活水平提高了，有吃的穿的，有房子住，不是到头了。人们会有更高的要求，要有文化生活，一定要加强农村的精神文明建设，让农民生活过得更加丰富多彩。
    李鹏总理还到昌平县城问候了正在售货的商业职工。
