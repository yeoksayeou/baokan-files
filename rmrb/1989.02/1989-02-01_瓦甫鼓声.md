A flash of lightning-like sprint, the small car pulled me into the outskirts of Kashgar, into the Wa Pu orchard. Today's celebration is held here. The earth serves as the stage, the sky as the roof; the cool breeze, the dense greenery. As soon as I sat down, a bowl of milk-white yogurt was served to me.

Suddenly, I noticed everyone in the crowd starting to move. Oh, these Uyghur comrades couldn't help but dance with joy. In this dancing crowd, the most eye-catching were a few drummers who, with hand drums, bounced from one end to the other, from the back to the front. Their movements were agile, combining strength and gentleness, with endless variations, clever and witty, stirring and plucking the most excited string in everyone's heart. They brought the festive atmosphere to a boil, making the dancers lose themselves in the dance and music.

In this noisy place, there was a silent note. He always sat quietly to the side with a smile, and that was Zhang Zhenwu, the secretary of the municipal committee of the border city. Eighty percent of the border city is composed of ethnic minorities, and Old Zhang is Han, but his authority is very high there. Two small incidents might reveal the reason. One is that he often brings a piece of flatbread to work, doesn't go home for lunch, and eats the flatbread with hot water in his office before continuing his work. The second is that once at night, a Uyghur comrade near Old Zhang's home suddenly fell ill. Old Zhang, despite the cold, pushed the car for three miles to the hospital. Old Zhang has lived on this border land for over thirty years. The high corn and sorghum of his hometown, and his childhood friends, have often appeared in his warm dreams. However, for the sake of work, he finally "set up camp" and stayed on this foreign land. Old Zhang's best years were given to this beautiful but lonely land in the depths of the desert. Isn't Old Zhang also a faithful drummer?

Because of this, the sound of the Wa Pu drum is so moving?

Tired. Thirsty. The dancing crowd dispersed to rows of low tables. On the tables were large jars of grape wine, high piles of lamb skewers, and fresh fruits. After eating and drinking to satisfaction, it was already dusk. A layer of light blue mist rose in the orchard. Time to leave. I squeezed into the car of the performing arts troupe.

The car was still full of people singing enthusiastically. A bearded, burly man was staggering like a drunkard, drumming on a hand drum in the aisle, shaking the car and people, not caring about the sweat dripping down his neck. Where did he come from in that performing arts troupe? Surprisingly, upon asking, he turned out to be a director from the local economic department!

What a singing and dancing, optimistic, and open-minded people! In the depths of the desert, there are often hundreds of miles without a trace of human habitation. Thus, too much loneliness has shaped such a people who are not willing to be lonely. They drive away loneliness with songs and dances. They weave their lives with songs and dances. Thousands of years of history have shaped a group of brave spirits. Yes, as long as there is a piece of flatbread by their side, they will beat it like a drum.

　　瓦甫鼓声
    吕锦华
    一阵闪电般冲刺，小车将我拉进喀什市郊的瓦甫果园。今儿的联欢会就在这儿举行。地作舞台，天当屋顶；阵阵凉风，满眼浓绿。刚坐下，一碗乳白如琼浆的酸奶已送到嘴边。
    忽觉满场子的人都在晃动起来。哦，这些维族同志都情不自禁欢舞起来了。在这片欢舞的人群中，最吸引人的，当数几位敲着手鼓从这头蹦到那头，从后面转到前面的鼓手了。他们动作利索，刚柔相济，变化多端，机灵俏皮，挑逗着拨动着每人心中那根最兴奋的弦。他们将欢闹的气氛搅到了沸点，使欢舞的人忘情陶醉在舞步和乐曲中。
    在这喧闹的场地上，有一个沉默的音符。他始终微笑着坐在一旁，这就是边城市委书记张振务同志。边城百分之八十是少数民族同志，老张是汉族，在当地却威信极高。有两件小事或可窥其原因。一是他经常带一块馕饼上班，中午不回家，在办公室里用开水泡馕，然后又办起公来。二是有次深夜，老张家不远处有位维族同志得了急病，老张不顾天寒地冻用小车推了三里路，送到医院。老张在这块边陲土地上生活了三十多年。老家的高粱玉米，老家的童年伙伴，曾经多次出现在温馨的梦中。然而，为了工作，终于“安营扎寨”留在这块异乡土地上了。老张最美好的年华给了大漠深处这块美丽但毕竟寂寞的土地。老张，不也是一名忠实的鼓手么？
    因这，瓦甫鼓声才如此动情？
    累了。渴了。欢舞的人散向一条条矮几。矮几上是大罐大罐的葡萄酒，是叠得高高的羊肉串和新鲜瓜果。吃饱喝足时已黄昏。果园里升起了一层淡蓝色的雾霭。上路了。我挤进了文工团的轿子车。
    满车厢人仍兴致浓浓在唱。一位络腮胡子的彪形大汉则醉汉似地跌跌撞撞敲着手鼓在过道上来回蹦跳，车摇人晃全不在意，满脖子的汗水顾不上擦擦。他来自那个文工团？不料一问，竟是当地经济部门的一位局长！
    好一个能歌善舞、乐观豁达的民族！大漠深处，常常几百里地没有人烟。于是，太多的寂寞塑造了这样一个不甘寂寞的民族。他们用歌舞驱散寂寞。他们用歌舞编织生活。几千年岁月，塑造了一群勇敢的精灵。是的，只要身边还有一块馕，他们就会把这块馕当作面鼓敲起来。
