Title: Industrial Waste Causes Concern

In recent years, many industrialized countries have been struggling to deal with hazardous waste. In 1987 alone, the United States produced 275 million tons of dangerous waste, most of which was plastic, paint, solvents, and other industrial byproducts. Disposing of this waste costs over $2,000 per ton, and with limited disposal sites, many industrialized countries are attempting to export these hazardous wastes.

The primary targets for exporting waste are developing countries, where the cost of waste storage is extremely low. Since 1986, at least 11 developing countries have accepted waste from developed nations, with another 38 countries receiving similar requests. Some waste brokers have profited greatly from this trade.

Now, many third-world countries have refused to import waste. Last May, Congolese police arrested three high-ranking government officials, including the top environmental protection official, on charges of conspiring to import 100 million tons of chemical waste. Nigeria has announced that anyone importing hazardous waste, including foreigners, will be sentenced to death. Seven Caribbean countries have also banned the import of foreign waste. Last May, the Organization of African Unity decided to stop importing waste and established a "Waste Monitoring Agency" to prevent new waste from entering.

However, amidst the global rejection of industrial waste, Britain has chosen to import hazardous chemical waste for processing. In 1987, Britain's waste processing industry had an annual output value of $8 billion.

### 工业垃圾使人忧

　　工业垃圾使人忧
    近年来，许多工业国家为处理有害垃圾大伤脑筋。１９８７年，光是美国的工业就产生了２．７５亿吨危险性废料，其中大部分为塑胶、油漆、溶剂等工业的副产品。处理这些垃圾，每吨要花２０００多美元，加上弃置场所稀少，因此许多工业国家都试图把这些有害废料运出国门。
    出口垃圾的主要对象是发展中国家，因此这些国家的垃圾储存费极为便宜。自１９８６年开始，至少有１１个发展中国家曾接收来自发达国家的垃圾，另有３８个国家接到类似要求。一些垃圾掮客因而大发其财。
    现在，不少第三世界国家已拒绝进口垃圾。去年５月，刚果警察以阴谋输入１００万吨化学废料的罪名，逮捕了包括环保最高主管在内的３名政府高级官员。尼日利亚宣布，任何进口有害废料的人，包括外国人都要被处死。７个加勒比地区的国家也禁止外国前来弃置废料。去年５月，非洲统一组织决定不再输入废料，并成立“垃圾监视机构”，禁止新的垃圾输入。
    但是，在各国一片排斥工业垃圾声浪中，英国却进口危险性化学废料，进行处理。１９８７年，英国处理垃圾的工业年产值达８０亿美元。
