Title: "Good Good Good" and "Done Done Done"

When visiting a certain unit to discuss work, the person I met was extremely enthusiastic. After listening to my request, they readily agreed, saying "Good good good" repeatedly. However, afterwards, there was no sign of action. This happened three times, resulting in "Done done done." It reminded me of the line from "Dream of the Red Chamber" by the lame monk: "In this world, everything is good when it's done, and done when it's good."

When you agree to do something for someone, you should follow through. If you don't want to do it or can't do it, don't agree in the first place to avoid causing trouble. However, some of our units have somehow learned to play it off, pretending to agree in person but then doing nothing afterwards. Perhaps they encountered difficulties while trying to do it, but they should still give feedback to the person, letting them find another way. The person is waiting anxiously, while you have no further response. This is unacceptable from a work perspective, as well as from an ethical and courtesy standpoint. If important matters are delayed, the country suffers the loss. Playing it off can lead to delays and harm the country, and this is not an exaggeration.

The habit of playing it off is essentially a manifestation of irresponsibility in work. For the person involved, it's a matter of responsibility. Everyone has their own position, and if everyone does their job diligently, many things will be much easier to handle. If you're in a position but don't do your job, and just occupy the position without contributing, efficiency is out of the question. In that case, nothing will get done, and it will be a complete "done done done."

### “好好好”与“了了了”

　　“好好好”与“了了了”
　　铭清
    到某单位联系工作，接谈者热情有加，听完要求，便满口应承，一叠声“好好好”，可事后不见动静。如是者三，成了“了了了”，不由得想起《红楼梦》里跛足道人那句“可知世上万般，好便是了，了便是好”的名言来。
    应承了人家的事，理该去办，不想办或办不了就别应承，以免误事。可我们一些机关不知何日起学会了打哈哈，当面虚与委蛇，事后泥牛入海。也许是在办的过程遇到了困难，办不下去，那也得给人家回音，让人家另谋他途。人家一头等得发急，你那一头却没了下文，这不论从工作上，还是从道义上、礼貌上，都是说不过去的。如果干系重大的事给耽误了，损失的还是国家。打哈哈误事误国，并非危言耸听。
    打哈哈的作风实质上是工作不负责任的表现，对当事者则是个责任心的问题。每个人都有自己的岗位，人人在自己的岗位上尽职尽责，各种事就会好办得多。在其位不谋其政，尸位素餐，效率无从谈起，那真是什么事也办不成，彻底的一了百了了。
