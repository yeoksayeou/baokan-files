On December 9 last year, the second engineering team of our section was performing track replacement work on the Luoyang Railway Bureau's Lingbao to Yindian section when more than 200 villagers suddenly stole some railway equipment, causing the track replacement to be delayed that day and the opening of the line to be postponed by 40 minutes.

Recently, two new batteries worth 1,200 yuan, more than 200 meters of new cables, as well as a large amount of sulfur, plastic pads, and mineral wax from this team's anchor removal site were also stolen by nearby villagers.

We appeal to the local government and public security departments to strengthen legal education for villagers along the railway, severely crack down on criminals who steal railway equipment, and ensure the smooth operation of trains.

　　村民盗抢器材　铁路施工受阻
    去年１２月９日，我段第二工程队正在洛阳铁路分局灵宝至阴店段进行换轨作业时，附近的２００多名村民突然将一些铁路器材抢走，造成当天换轨晚点，推迟开通线路４０分钟。
    不久前，这个队拔锚工地两只价值１２００元的新电瓶、２００多米新电缆，以及大量硫磺、塑料胶垫和矿蜡等也被附近村民盗走。
    呼吁当地政府及公安部门加强对铁路沿线村民的法制教育，严厉打击盗窃铁路器材的犯罪分子，保证列车畅通无阻。
