Title: The Mountain Conqueror

	You can live along any path
	You can die in any mountain valley
	From the start, you know
	Reputation can be changed like a fur coat
	Worn and removed ten times
	But life is only one
	Do not look back at the path
	That single, winding branch, slowly
	Hangs a single ripe fruit
	As long as the gaze of the caterpillar silently moves
	It will hollow out a heart full of long-stored sweet dew
	Shoulders leaning forward
	Rising like a mountain's path
	Knowing that the sheep fat torch
	May be suddenly swallowed
	By the mountain wind like a brown wolf
	Also knowing that the warmth in the chest
	Of a few pieces of food
	No matter what, cannot like a bronze shield
	Break the arrows of hunger
	Only the feet are your own
	Stepping out the winding eagle flute on the mountain path
	Only the eyes are your own
	Seeing yourself as a genuine rock sheep
	Then there is no choice, not wanting to grow
	To the height of the mountain, only wanting to challenge
	The lead-colored sky
	Those who dare to venture into the mountains are real men
	Men who venture into the mountains are true men
	And true men are never moved by themselves.

　　闯山汉
　　黄毅
    随便哪条路旁你都可以活着
    随便哪处山坳你都可以死去
    初来时你就清楚
    名誉可以像换皮袄一样
    穿上脱下十次
    而性命只有一条
    不回望来路
    那一枝蜿蜒的末梢，悠悠
    独挂一只红熟的她
    只要目光的青虫悄然爬动
    便会镂空一腔久蓄的甘霖
    肩头前倾
    耸成山的走向
    知道羊油火把
    极可能被棕狼一样的山风
    冷不防一口吞噬
    也知道怀间焐热的些许饟饼
    无论如何不能像青铜之盾
    折断饥饿射来的利箭
    只有脚是自己的
    踏出山道上袅袅的鹰笛
    只有眼睛是自己的
    看自己为地地道道的岩羊
    而后就没有选择了，不想长
    　成
    山的高度，只想对铅色的苍
    　空挑战
    敢于闯山的人才是汉子
    闯进山的汉子才为真汉子
    而真汉子从来不会被自己所
    　打动……
