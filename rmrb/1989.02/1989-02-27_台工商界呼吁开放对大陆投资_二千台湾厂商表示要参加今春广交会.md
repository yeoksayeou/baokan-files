Taiwanese business representatives, numbering around 30, recently held a meeting at the "Ministry of Justice" to discuss the "Provisional Regulations on Cross-Strait Relations." They unanimously suggested that the authorities should open up investment in mainland China and allow direct trade.

The representatives pointed out that international protectionism is rampant, and the United States has repeatedly demanded the appreciation of the New Taiwan Dollar. Additionally, Taiwan is facing a labor shortage, and labor costs have significantly increased. This predicament has caused Taiwanese businesses to gradually lose their competitiveness in the international market, making it urgent to explore new markets or investment channels. If the mainland market can be developed, it will provide a respite for businesspeople. They stated that businesspeople operate on a profit-and-loss basis, and the authorities do not need to bear the risk, so there is no need for a ban.

It was revealed that the draft of the "Provisional Regulations on Cross-Strait Relations" prepared by the Taiwanese authorities includes clauses prohibiting investment in mainland China and direct trade, and imposes a penalty of up to three years' imprisonment for violations.

According to reports from Taiwan, at least 2,000 Taiwanese manufacturers plan to participate in the annual Canton Fair this spring.

Some Taiwanese businesspeople participated in the Canton Fair last year and gave positive feedback. Currently, many businesspeople are inquiring about travel agencies for departure dates. Local travel agencies have begun arranging flights and accommodations. Due to the high demand for tickets and accommodations during the fair, and the limited number of visitor passes, travel agencies have arranged a special "Taiwanese Compatriots Group" with a 5-day, 4-night itinerary, excluding meals, and staying in mid-range hotels. Due to the low cost, many Taiwanese businesspeople have signed up.

　　台工商界呼吁开放对大陆投资
    二千台湾厂商表示要参加今春广交会
    新华社北京２月２６日电  台湾工商界代表３０多人日前在“法务部”召开的两岸关系“暂行条例”座谈会上，一致建议当局开放对大陆投资和直接通商。
    代表指出，国际保护主义盛行，美国又一再要求台币升值，而台湾劳工缺乏，用人成本大幅提高。这种困境已使台湾工商界在国际市场逐渐失去竞争力，极需开拓市场或对外投资途径。如果大陆市场能开发，可给工商业者喘息的机会。他们表示，工商业者经营事业本就盈亏自理，当局不须负风险，何必要禁止。
    报纸透露，台湾当局拟定的两岸关系“暂行条例”草案中列有条文，禁止到大陆投资和直接通商，并对违犯者判三年以下有期徒刑。
    本报香港２月２６日电　据台报报道，目前台湾至少有２０００厂商拟前往参加一年一度的广州春季交易会。
    部分台商去年曾参加过广交会，反映相当不错。目前有不少台商向旅行社打听出发日期。当地旅行业者已开始着手安排机位与旅馆。由于交易会期间机票和旅馆供不应求，参观证有限，旅行业者已透过特殊渠道，安排一种５天４夜行程的“台胞团”，不包饮食，住中级宾馆。由于收费不高，台商报名者众。
