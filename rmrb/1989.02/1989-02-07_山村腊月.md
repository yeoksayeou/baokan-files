		A Mountain Village in December
		Zhou Shaohan

		It is another busy season after the harvest,
		Busy with the daylight,
		Busy with the cold nights,
		Busy anticipating
		The joyful explosion of firecrackers in vibrant colors.
		Children hand over their wishes and report cards
		To their busy mothers, quietly fishing out
		The long-awaited affection from their
		Gaze.
		The elderly, under the lamp, think of those fleeting moments.
		“Don’t mention it?…” But occasionally
		In the hands of the daughter-in-law,
		They weigh it up… The husband returns from afar—
		Without shaking off the snow from outside the Great Wall, he
		Pulls up
		The long “military green” uniform, spreading out a feast
		Of long-awaited comfort, reunion’s crisp fragrance,
		And a heart full of
		Passion. The wife smiles beside him, but
		Does not smile out
		The sweet or sour, the drunk or sober, rhythm.

　　山村腊月
　　周少汉
    是收获后的又一个
    匆忙季节，匆忙着白昼
    匆忙着寒夜，匆忙地盼着
    一声爆竹爆出五彩缤纷的欢喜
    孩子将心事与成绩报告单一起
    递交给匆忙的母亲，悄悄从她
    眼神里打捞着他久久渴望的心意
    老人在灯下想的那些瞬间消逝了
    “别提及吧？……”可又偶尔
    在儿媳的
    手里掂起……丈夫从远方归来——
    没有抖落长城外的飞雪，便
    撩起
    那长长的“国防绿”摊出一席
    久别的慰藉、团聚的脆香、
    满腔的
    炽烈。妻子在一旁笑了，却
    没笑出
    是甜是酸、是醉是醒的韵味
