Polish Party Central Committee Secretary on Party Issues: People Should Have Choices in Elections

	Polish United Workers' Party Politburo member and Central Committee Secretary Orzechowski, who oversees ideological work, said, "If Poland had two socialist parties, that would be ideal, as the Polish people would have choices in free elections."

	He made these remarks in an interview with the Swedish news agency on February 13. He believes that the Polish people do not want to return to capitalism but hope that the country can continue to guarantee full employment and social stability. A few days earlier, Polish Prime Minister Rakowski also discussed Poland's multiparty system in an interview with French journalists. When asked whether Poland would truly implement a multiparty system, he said, "This is hard to predict because it is a historical process, and its development does not depend on our will."

	He said that the development of the Polish United Workers' Party has now entered a very important stage. After seriously analyzing the situation and actual needs, the Polish United Workers' Party is giving up its monopoly on power.

	Rakowski also said that Poland's turnaround was not influenced by any external interference. It was achieved with the full trust of Soviet leader Gorbachev.

　　波党中央书记谈政党问题    
    应使人民在选举中有所选择
    新华社华沙２月１４日电  波兰统一工人党主管意识形态工作的政治局委员、中央书记奥热霍夫斯基说，“如果波兰有两个社会主义政党那就理想了，波兰人民在自由选举中就可以有所选择”。
    他是在１３日接受瑞典通讯社记者采访时发表上述看法的。他认为，波兰人民并不想回到资本主义，只是希望国家能继续保证充分就业和社会安定。几天前，波兰总理拉科夫斯基在接受法国记者采访时也谈到了波兰的多党制问题。他在谈到波兰是否会真正实行多党制问题时指出，“这无法预料，因为这是一个历史进程，它的发展不取决于我们的意志”。
    他说，目前波兰统一工人党的发展已进入非常重要的阶段。在认真分析了形势和现实需要以后，波兰统一工人党正在放弃对政权的垄断。
    拉科夫斯基还说，波兰的转折没受到任何外来的干涉，它是在苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫充分信任的情况下实现的。
