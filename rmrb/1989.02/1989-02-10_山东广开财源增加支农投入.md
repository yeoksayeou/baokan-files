Shandong broadens revenue sources to increase agricultural investment

Last year, the province's total expenditure on agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy, as well as the financial turnover fund for agriculture, increased by 36% and 20% respectively compared to the previous year.

According to a report, the financial departments at various levels in Shandong Province have expanded their thinking, broadened their revenue sources, and increased their investment in agriculture, thereby effectively meeting the needs of agricultural development. Last year, the province's cumulative expenditure on supporting rural production funds and agricultural, forestry, and water conservancy projects increased by 36% compared to the previous year, and the financial turnover fund for agriculture increased by 20%.

The financial departments at various levels in this province have fully played their functional roles and sought multiple channels to increase agricultural investment. The main measures include: establishing an agricultural development fund system for specialized use; focusing on the grassroots level, helping township financial departments to raise funds for agriculture; combining state-supported funds with farmers' self-raised funds, adopting input subsidies, output-oriented use, and income adjustment systems, etc. For example, various levels of financial departments raised more than 1.6 billion yuan to support the comprehensive development of agriculture in 83 counties in the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain. In the same year, 112,000 mu of wasteland was reclaimed, 238,000 mu of saline-alkali and waterlogged land was treated and improved, and the area of irrigated farmland was improved and expanded by 35.6 million mu. Through several years of efforts, all 45 grain base counties and 8 lean-type pig base counties in the province have been established. The development of coastal shallow seas and tidal flats completed more than 300,000 mu last year. The development and construction of mountainous areas, lake areas, and reservoir areas have also made significant progress. Last year, the provincial finance also allocated more than 500 million yuan to support the establishment of a technological extension service system, creating conditions for agricultural research achievements to be quickly transformed into productive forces. Among them, 12 key supported scientific research projects received national awards. The 12 achievements increased grain and oil production by 344 million jin, cotton by 1.78 million dan, and together with aquatic products and livestock and poultry, the total increased production value was 887 million yuan.

　　山东广开财源增加支农投入
    去年，全省支援农林水利总支出和财政支农周转金分别比上年增长百分之三十六和百分之二十
    本报讯　山东省各级财政部门拓宽思路，广开财源，增加支农投入，较好地保证了农业发展的需要。去年，全省支援农村生产资金和农林水利事业费累计支出比上年增长３６％，财政支农周转金比上年增长２０％。
    这个省的各级财政部门充分发挥职能作用，多渠道寻求增加农业投入的途径。主要包括：建立农业发展基金制度，专款专用；立足基层，帮助乡镇财政筹集支农资金；把国家扶持资金与农民自筹资金结合起来，采取投入补助制、产出定向使用制和收益调节制等等。如各级财政筹集资金１．６亿多元，支持黄淮海平原的８３个县进行农业综合开发，当年开垦荒地１１．２万亩，治理改良盐碱涝洼地２３．８万亩，改善和扩大农田灌溉面积３５６万亩。通过几年的努力，全省４５个粮食基地县和８个瘦肉型猪基地县已全部建成。浅海滩涂开发去年完成了３０多万亩。山区、湖区、库区等开发建设也都取得了很大进展。去年，省财政还安排资金５００多万元，支持建立技术推广服务体系，为农业科研成果尽快转化为生产力创造了条件。其中重点支持的１２个科研项目获得了国家奖励。１２项成果，共增产粮油３．４４亿公斤，棉花１７８万担，加上水产品、畜禽，共新增产值８．８７亿元。
    在不断增加农业投入的同时，这个省的各级财政部门切实加强支农资金的管理，建立了严格的项目考察评估制、跟踪问效制和检查验收制。同时，他们对支农周转金从有偿无息占用改为有偿付费占用，并区别不同扶持项目，制订了不同费率。
