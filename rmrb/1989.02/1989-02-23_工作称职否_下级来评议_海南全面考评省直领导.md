After the Spring Festival, the Hainan Provincial Government began implementing annual evaluations in provincial-level departments. The trial evaluation at the Financial and Taxation Bureau has already concluded, and the evaluation of the province's 1988 work will begin in late March.

This evaluation aims to publicly disclose the annual work performance of leading cadres and provide a periodic assessment. The evaluation method involves leading cadres giving work reports, followed by democratic discussions, public opinion surveys, and social evaluations, summarizing opinions on four aspects: morality, ability, diligence, and performance.

Liu Guisu, the Director of the Hainan Provincial Financial and Taxation Bureau, along with Deputy Directors Chen Bangbo and Li Qiongzhu, underwent a three-day evaluation. Over 200 officials from various government departments, enterprises, and the Financial and Taxation Bureau listened to their work reports.

Deputy Governor Bao Kemin commented on this evaluation of leading cadres: The public evaluation of officials by provincial government departments is an important part of Hainan's implementation of the civil servant system. The key to evaluating whether a public servant is competent is to see if they have a strong desire and sense of responsibility to serve the people and do their job well; if they have practical work abilities; and if they accept effective social supervision. Only by placing everyone's work under social supervision can we ensure the integrity and efficiency of Hainan's cadre team.

It is reported that the annual evaluation of leading cadres across the province will be fully implemented in provincial-level departments and various cities and counties by the end of March.

　　工作称职否　下级来评议
    海南全面考评省直领导
    本报海口２月２２日电  记者罗自苏报道：春节之后，海南省政府开始在省直机关推行年度考核。试点单位财税厅的考核已于日前结束，对全省１９８８年度工作的考核将于３月底铺开。
    这次考核，旨在公开领导干部的年度工作情况，对他们进行阶段性的评价。考核方法是，由领导干部作述职报告后，经过民主评论、民意调查、社会评介，从德、能、勤、绩四方面汇总成考核意见。
    海南省财税厅厅长刘桂苏，副厅长陈榜波、黎琼珠接受了３天的考核。来自政府各部门、企业和财税厅的２００名干部听取了述职报告。
    副省长鲍克明就这次考评领导干部发表讲话说：省政府部门公开考核干部，是海南省推行公务员制度的重要内容。考察一个公职人员是否称职，主要看其是否有为人民服务做好本职工作的强烈愿望和责任感；是否有实际工作能力；是否接受有效的社会监督。只有将每一个人的工作置于社会监督之下，才能保证海南干部队伍的廉洁和高效率。
    据悉，全省领导干部的年度考核将于３月底在省直机关和各市县全面铺开。
