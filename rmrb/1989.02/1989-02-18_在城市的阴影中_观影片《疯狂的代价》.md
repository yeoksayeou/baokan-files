Young director Zhou Xiaowen has already made three films. Although it cannot be said that each one is a shockwave, they are always a significant tremor. From "They Are Still Young" to "The Last Madness," this time he has released another film, "The Price of Madness" (produced by Xi'an Film Studio).

Unlike the action, suspense, and chase scenes in "The Last Madness," "The Price of Madness" presents a narrative that is more leisurely. It stands between art and entertainment, tradition and exploration, America and France, seemingly becoming a difficult-to-categorize "special case."

In "The Price of Madness," there is a serene world, a sisterly home, with bright, white, and tranquil spaces, filled with love, anticipation, and the restlessness of youth. Opposing this is a tumultuous world, a brotherly home, with dim, confined spaces, carrying the ferocity of power and desire. These seem to be two worlds that will never overlap, with a bustling, crowded, and vast city between them. But these two worlds do eventually meet. In a dark corner of the city at night, the younger sister Lanlan is raped by a criminal. At this moment of encounter, the serene world of the sisterly home is shattered, losing its tranquility forever. What follows is the elder sister Qingqing's obstinate and nearly mad pursuit and revenge. She wants to find the criminal in the vast crowd of the metropolis, to expose him, and to taste the revenge a hundred times over.

This is a common plot in crime films: crime/pursuit, the journey of justice and revenge. But the film, without explicit words, reveals another psychological journey. As Qingqing's pursuit gradually approaches the mad criminal, she herself is also gradually approaching the crime, step by step, moving from her already shattered world of love and family to the swamp in her heart—the dark center of evil and madness. When she fights with the criminal and is taken as a hostage to the top of a tower, she has truly entered the world she would never have reached—the world of evil. Finally, after the criminal is subdued by the law, Qingqing kicks the criminal off the tower. At the end of her journey of justice and revenge, she falls into evil. The film completes a transfer of crime at this moment: the avenger of justice becomes a "fascist" before defeating the "fascist." The price of madness is not only legal punishment but also death, madness, and new crimes.

Director Zhou Xiaowen successfully and naturally covers his unusual anxious gaze with a narrative that is smooth, fluid, and calm. He accurately and sensitively directs his gaze towards the crowd in modern cities, towards the evil of urban people that comes with industrial civilization, and towards the shadows in people's hearts that even sunlight cannot illuminate during the overlap of two civilizations.

This film, which may not be a classic, has reached a relatively high threshold for Chinese cinema. That is the combination of story and philosophy, plot and visual language, the film market, and the director's personal style. "The Price of Madness," with its complete and smooth narrative and elegant artistry, has become one of the notable film phenomena of 1988 in China. In the face of the reform tide and the cries of survival crisis in the film industry, Zhou Xiaowen has submitted a good report.

Zhou Xiaowen's three films are each unique. "They Are Still Young" was entirely shot on location, almost entirely with non-professional actors, in the style of documentary aesthetics; "The Last Madness" was fast-paced, high-frequency, full of suspense, action, design, and plot, with all the trappings of a crime film; while "The Price of Madness" has a leisurely narrative, meticulous production, and meaningful imagery, which can be called a "song-like adagio," with a strong French film flavor. But beneath these surface differences, there is a more solid core and pursuit. In each of his films, there is a dual narrative structure; in each film, there is a pair of protagonists living in two completely opposite worlds, driven by a nearly fateful, enormous social force to pursue and seek each other, and their encounter is both the establishment of a new balance and a destructive collision.

Director Zhou Xiaowen, with a Qingqing-like obstinacy, tenaciously gazes into the abyss of the human soul in modern society, while also maintaining a detached, non-dizzying overview.

### 在城市的阴影中——观影片《疯狂的代价》

　　在城市的阴影中
    ——观影片《疯狂的代价》
    郭启宏
    青年导演周晓文已有了３部影片。虽不能说每一部都是一次冲击波，却总是一个不大不小的震动。自《他们正年轻》而《最后的疯狂》，这一次他又推出一部《疯狂的代价》（西安电影制片厂）。
    一反《最后的疯狂》的动作、悬念、追逐，《代价》呈现出一种叙事的悠然。它置身于艺术与娱乐之间，传统与探索之间，美国与法国之间，似乎成了个难于归档的“个例”。
    在《代价》中有一个恬美的世界，那是一个姐妹之家，空间明亮、纯白、安详，充满了爱意、期待与青春的骚动。而与之对峙的是一个动荡的世界，那是一个兄弟之家，空间晦暗、幽闭，带着力与欲的狰狞。这似乎是两个永远不会互相叠加的世界，在它们之间隔着一个喧嚣、拥挤而广漠的城市。但这两个世界却毕竟相遇了。在城市之夜某一个阴暗的角落，小妹妹兰兰遭到了罪犯的强暴。在这个相遇的瞬间，那个姐妹之家的恬美世界被撞得粉碎，永远地失却了它的安详。接踵而来的是姐姐青青固执而几近疯狂的追逐与复仇。她要在大都市的茫茫人群中追寻罪犯，她要找到他，要揭露他，要尝尝十倍乃至百倍的复仇的滋味。
    这是警匪片中的惯例：犯罪／追逐，正义的复仇之旅。但影片却在不言之中，展示了另一个心理旅程。当青青的追逐一步步地接近了疯狂的罪犯，同时她自己也在一步步地接近了罪行，一步步地从她那已经破碎的，充满爱意、亲情的世界走向了她心灵深处的沼泽——邪恶与疯狂的黑暗中心。当她与罪犯搏斗，并作为人质被拖上塔楼顶层的时候，她已真正进入了那个她本永远不会到达的世界——罪恶的世界。终于，当罪犯被擒伏法之后，青青飞起一脚把罪犯踢下了塔楼。在她正义复仇之旅的终点扑向了罪恶。影片在这一瞬间完成了一次罪行转移：正义的复仇者在战胜“法西斯”之前已成了“法西斯”。疯狂的代价不仅是法律的惩治，而且是死亡、疯狂与新的罪行。
    导演周晓文成功地、毫不造作地以一种叙事的光洁、流畅与安然覆盖了他那份异样焦虑的目光。他准确而锐敏地将视线投向现代城市中的人群，投向与工业文明同时降临的大都市人的邪恶，投向两种文明叠加之际，人们内心深处阳光也无法照亮的阴影。
    这部也许并非传世的影片，踏上了一个对中国电影说来是较高的门坎。那便是故事与哲理、情节与视听语言、电影市场与导演的个人铭文的结合。《疯狂的代价》以其叙事的完整、流畅，艺术的优雅，成了１９８８年中国影坛上令人瞩目的电影现象之一。在改革大潮面前，在电影生存危机的一片惊呼与呐喊之间，周晓文交了一份不错的答卷。
    周晓文的三部影片，一部一个样儿。《他们正年轻》，全部实景拍摄，近乎全部非职业演员，一派纪实美学的架式；《最后的疯狂》则是快节奏、高频率、悬念、动作、造型、情节，全套警匪片的行头；而《疯狂的代价》则叙事从容、制作精良、画面表意，可称之为“如歌的行板”，大有法国优质电影的韵味。但在这表面的不同之间，却有着一个更为坚实的内核与求索。在他的每部影片中都有着一种双向展开的叙事构型；在每一部影片中，他都有着一对生存于两个截然对立的世界中的主人公，他们都为一种几近宿命式的巨大的社会力量驱使互相追逐、寻找，而他们的相遇既是一种全新的平衡的建立，又是一次毁灭的撞击。
    导演周晓文以一种青青式的执拗，顽强地凝视着现代社会中人类心灵的深谷，同时也是一种绝不晕眩的超然的俯瞰。
