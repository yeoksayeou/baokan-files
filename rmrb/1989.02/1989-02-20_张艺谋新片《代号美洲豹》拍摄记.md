Last February, "Red Sorghum" won the top prize at the West Berlin International Film Festival, making Zhang Yimou famous overnight. People cheered and praised, but there were also criticisms and expectations.

After a period of calm reflection, Zhang Yimou decided to shoot a film that is full of life and humor, has strong appeal, broad acceptance, and can reflect social issues. His idea coincided with that of the young manager, Zong Feng, from the Modern Technology and Culture Development Department of Xi'an City. They decided to collaborate on the film, with the Modern Technology and Culture Development Department providing the investment, and Zhang Yimou and Yang Fengliang co-directing, with Gu Changwei as the cinematographer.

After reading numerous novels and scripts, Zhang Yimou chose the novel "Men and Women" by young writer Wang Shuo. This novel revolves around the protagonist's bizarre gender transformation, reflecting the complex interpersonal relationships in real society and revealing the widespread problems of life. The entire novel is filled with humor and comedy. However, readability does not equate to watchability, and there are several hurdles from a novel to a film. Despite Wang Shuo's best efforts, revising the script three times, and Yang Fengliang polishing it four times, due to the inability to satisfactorily address the props and technical issues brought by the gender transformation, "Men and Women" could not become a film script ready for shooting. Reluctantly, they had to abandon this plan. Zhang Yimou faced a tough choice. He had already signed a contract to co-produce "The Terracotta Warriors" with Hong Kong in October, and Gu Changwei was scheduled to go to the United States in December to collaborate with Chen Kaige on a film. If he gave up now, everyone would go their separate ways, which he found hard to bear; if he took a new path and started shooting a new film, the time was too tight. However, he had to make a choice. Zhang Yimou finally mustered his courage and decided to shoot another film.

He immediately selected the script and began adapting it. This time, he chose "Authorized Denial by the State Security Department" (later renamed "Code Name Jaguar") by Cheng Shiqing. Compared to the previous novel, it has a completely different artistic style. It is fictional but pursues a documentary approach, depicting how Taiwanese gangsters hijack an airplane, using hostages to demand extremely harsh and unreasonable conditions, and how the Chinese government and the Taiwanese authorities closely cooperate, formulate plans, and ultimately foil the terrorists' plot. After selecting the script, everyone immediately began the intense preparatory work. "Code Name Jaguar" went through many twists and turns and hardships, finally starting shooting at Beijing Shihe Airport on July 11.

Three months have passed. During this short yet long period, Zhang Yimou and his team worked tirelessly, getting up early and staying up late, living a busy yet fulfilling life. They completed the pre-production shooting as planned by the end of September. After completing the post-production in November last year, the main creators of the film went their separate ways: Zhang Yimou went to shoot "The Terracotta Warriors," playing the male lead again, but unfortunately suffered a leg injury and is currently recuperating; Gu Changwei went to the United States to shoot a film.

When "Code Name Jaguar" was submitted for review, it was evaluated by the Film Bureau as one of the most distinctive films among the large number of entertainment films last year. However, some experts thought it was a "game-like work" that did not match Zhang Yimou's skills. Let's not jump to conclusions. Let's wait and see how "Code Name Jaguar" performs when it is released.

　　张艺谋新片《代号美洲豹》拍摄记
    雅宾
    去年２月，《红高梁》在西柏林国际电影节一举夺魁，使张艺谋声誉鹊起，红极一时。人们欢呼、赞扬，当然也有批评和期待。
    经过一番冷静的思索，张艺谋打算拍摄一部充满生活气息和喜剧情味，可观性强，接受面广，同时又能反映社会问题的影片。他的这一想法与西安市现代科技文化发展部的青年经理宗锋不谋而合，他们决定合作拍片，由现代科技文化发展部投资，张艺谋和杨凤良联合执导，顾长卫任摄影。
    在翻阅了大量小说和剧本之后，张艺谋选中了青年作家王朔的小说《男人和女人》。这部小说，围绕主人公离奇的性变，反映现实社会复杂的人际关系，揭示社会普遍存在的人生问题。整个小说洋溢着诙谐、幽默的喜剧趣味。但是，可读性并不等于可观性，从小说到电影，尚隔着几道难关。尽管王朔竭尽全力，三易其稿，杨凤良四次加工润色，但由于无法圆满处理性变所带来的一些道具和技术性的问题，未能使《男人和女人》成为一部可以投入拍摄的电影脚本，迫不得已放弃了这个计划。张艺谋面临严峻的抉择。他已签定１０月与香港合拍《秦俑》的演出合同，顾长卫１２月也要赴美国与陈凯歌合作拍片。如果就此罢手，大家散伙，他有点于心不忍；如果另辟蹊径，投入新的影片拍摄，时间又太紧迫。然而他必须作出选择。张艺谋最终还是鼓足勇气，决心另拍一部。
    他当即选定剧本，着手改编，这次他看中的是程十庆的《国家安全部授权否认》（后改名为《代号美洲豹》）。与前一部小说相比，具有完全不同的艺术风格。它是虚构的，却又追求纪实性手法，描写台湾黑社会劫机者如何劫持飞机，以人质为条件，提出非常苛刻的无理要求，而中国政府和台湾当局，又是怎样密切合作，制定方案，最终彻底粉碎了恐怖分子的阴谋。剧本选好之后，大家立刻投入紧张的准备工作。《代号美洲豹》费尽周折，历尽磨难，总算在７月１１日于北京沙河机场开拍了。
    三个月过去了。在这短暂而又漫长的时间内，张艺谋和他的伙伴们早起晚睡，不知疲倦地工作，生活紧张而又充实，按原计划在９月底之前完成了前期拍摄。影片在去年１１月完成后期制作后，它的几位主要创作者又各奔东西：张艺谋去拍《秦俑》，再次出演男主角，不意遭到腿伤，正在休养；顾长卫到美国去拍片。
    《代号美洲豹》在送审时，被电影局评价为去年大量娱乐片中颇有特色的一部，但也有的专家认为像是“游戏之作”，与张艺谋的功力不相称。我们还是不要轻下断语，请观众拭目以待《代号美洲豹》的放映。
