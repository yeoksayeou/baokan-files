    The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has strictly controlled the use of arable land for non-agricultural construction while organizing large-scale land reclamation. This has reversed the trend of decreasing arable land, and currently, the per capita arable land is nearly four mu.

    Since 1986, the autonomous region has established land management agencies at various levels and conducted a comprehensive survey of non-agricultural construction land use across the region. By the end of last year, a total of 1,610,000 units (households) had been surveyed, identifying 240,000 cases of illegal land use. Of these, 229,000 cases have been handled. Various levels of land management departments have strictly implemented the land use approval system, curbing the trend of arbitrarily occupying and misusing arable land, and significantly reducing non-agricultural land use. In 1988, the total non-agricultural land use in the region was less than 70,000 mu (including 30,000 mu of wasteland), a decrease of 150,000 mu compared to 1986.

    At the same time, the autonomous region has prioritized land reclamation and the development of economic crops such as cotton and sugar beets as a strategic goal for economic development. Last year, the region reclaimed 1,680,000 mu of land, exceeding the total non-agricultural construction land used during the period from 1965 to 1985 by 180,000 mu.

　　控制非农业建设用地　组织大规模开荒造田
　　新疆耕地数量有所回升
    新华社乌鲁木齐二月九日电  （记者哈迪尔·马木提）新疆维吾尔自治区在严格控制非农业建设占用耕地的同时，组织大规模开荒造田，使耕地减少局面得到根本扭转，目前人均占有耕地近四亩。
    一九八六年以来，自治区建立各级土地管理机构，并在全区开展清查非农业建设用地工作。到去年底，共清查了一百六十一万多个单位（户），查出二十四万多个违章违法用地案件，并处理了二十二万九千件。各级土地管理部门严格执行用地审批制度，刹住了乱占滥用耕地的歪风，非农业建设用地直线下降。一九八八年全区非农用地不到七万亩（其中荒地三万亩），比一九八六年减少了十五万亩。
    与此同时，自治区还把开荒造田，发展棉花、甜菜等经济作物作为经济发展的战略来抓。去年全区共开荒一百六十八万多亩，比六五期间被占用的非农建设用地总数还多十八万多亩。
