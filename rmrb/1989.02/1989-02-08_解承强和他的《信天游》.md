When the music scene a few years ago was dominated by imitations of Hong Kong and Taiwan songs, making listeners tired, Xie Chengqiang, known as one of the "Three Knights of Light Music," turned his attention to the vast Northwest, a region rich in deep cultural traditions. The song "Xintianyou," which made it onto the "Top Ten Songs of the New Era Decade," was born out of this pursuit and reflection.

In the process of composing "Xintianyou," Xie Chengqiang first experienced the customs and habits of China's ethnic groups, repeatedly pondering the melodies and rhythms of excellent folk songs from various parts of the Northwest. He skillfully used the most common scales in Chinese songs, giving the music a sense of stability, lyricism, and accessibility, making it easy for singers and listeners to grasp. At the same time, he delved into the depth and potential of popular songs' expressive power, drawing on the composition techniques of foreign rock songs, and integrating the unique melodic style of China's Northwest region with modern popular music expression methods.

To reduce the "gap" in appreciation habits among different groups, Xie Chengqiang, while composing, not only paid attention to the national characteristics of melody, rhythm, and scale, but also to the features of easy-to-learn, easy-to-sing, and easy-to-remember folk songs. He also focused on the instrumentation, using the soft and fresh national instrument, the Chinese suona, as the main leading instrument in the song, and combining it with the ever-changing and varied electronic instruments. The fusion of East and West, alternating, adds a moving sonic color and a strong sense of traditional national culture to the song. Someone once said it is "the combination of Shan Dan Dan and rock music." I think this well represents the pursuit of this song.

　　解承强和他的《信天游》
　　苏元济
    当几年前流行歌坛上一味模仿港台的歌曲而令听众厌倦的时候，号称“轻音乐三剑客”的解承强就率先把目光投向了具有深厚的民族文化传统的大西北，名上“新时期十年金曲”榜的《信天游》正是在这种追求和思索中诞生的。
    解承强在构思《信天游》的过程中，首先体味了我国民族风俗的习性，反复琢磨大西北各地的优秀民歌的旋律和节奏特点，恰切地运用了我国歌曲中最常见的调式，使音乐有平稳、抒情、通俗之感，容易被歌者、听者掌握。同时还挖掘流行歌曲表现力的深度和潜力，借鉴了外国摇滚歌曲的创作技法，融我国西北地区特有的旋律风格与现代流行音乐的表现手法为一体。
    解承强为了缩短不同层次群众的欣赏习俗中的“反差”，在谱曲时除注意了旋律、节奏、调式的民族特色和易学、易唱、易记的歌谣型通俗歌曲的特点外，还在配器上大做文章，以柔和清新的民族器乐——中唢呐，作为曲中的主要领奏乐器，再配以变化无穷、音色各异的电声乐器，中西合璧，交替进行，给歌曲添上了动人的音响色彩和强烈的民族传统文化感染力。有人曾说它是“山丹丹与摇滚乐的结合”，我认为，这很能表现这首歌曲的追求特点。
