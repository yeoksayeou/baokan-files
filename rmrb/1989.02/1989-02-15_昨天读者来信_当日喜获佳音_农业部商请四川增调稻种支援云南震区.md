Yesterday, this newspaper published a letter from a reader titled "Clouds of Disaster in Yunnan Earthquake Zone Need Hybrid Rice Seeds" on the front page. The letter caught the attention of leaders in the Ministry of Agriculture. Minister He Kang and Vice Minister Chen Yaobang saw the letter in the newspaper in the afternoon and immediately decided to take action. Chen Yaobang called Sichuan Province Vice Governor Liu Changjie to request that Sichuan Province allocate additional hybrid rice seeds to support the earthquake-stricken areas in Yunnan. Sichuan has already shipped 500 million kilograms of rice seeds to support both Yunnan and Guizhou provinces. After receiving Chen Yaobang's call, Liu Changjie decided to overcome the shortage of rice seeds in more than 10 counties in Sichuan and actively allocate a batch of high-quality hybrid rice seeds to the farmers in the earthquake-stricken areas of Yunnan.

Chen Yaobang mentioned that in previous years, the rice seeds needed by Yunnan and Guizhou were mainly supplied by Sichuan and Hunan. Last year, Hunan suffered a major disaster and had a significant shortfall in rice seeds. The Ministry of Agriculture coordinated the national allocation, and now the needs of various places have been basically met.

　　昨天读者来信　当日喜获佳音    
    农业部商请四川增调稻种支援云南震区
    本报讯  昨日本报一版刊登《云南地震灾区急需杂交稻种》读者来信，受到农业部领导同志的重视。何康部长、陈耀邦副部长当日下午看到报上的来信后，立即商妥，由陈耀邦打电话给四川省副省长刘昌杰，商请四川省增调杂交稻良种支援云南震区。四川已调运５００万公斤稻种支援云贵两省，刘昌杰接到陈耀邦的电话后，决定克服本省１０多个县稻种不足的困难，积极调剂一批杂交稻良种给云南地震灾区农民。
    陈耀邦说，往年，云南、贵州所需稻种均由四川、湖南提供。去年湖南遭受大灾减产，稻种缺额较大。对此，农业部在全国统筹安排，现已基本满足各地需要。
