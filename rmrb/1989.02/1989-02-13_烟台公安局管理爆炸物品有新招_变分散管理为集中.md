The management of civilian explosives, a long-standing headache, has been brought under legal regulation by the Yantai Public Security Bureau in Shandong Province during the deepening of reforms, significantly reducing the occurrence of explosion incidents and fatal accidents.

Yantai City is located in a hilly area with abundant mineral resources. Historically, the city has relied on mining for economic development, with thousands of units using explosives to extract gold, silver, coal, iron, and stone. In the past, due to the long-term disconnection between production and safety management, the loss of explosives has been severe, posing a significant threat to social security. Each year, the number of personal injuries, economic losses, and revenge or murder cases caused by explosives has been increasing.

In recent years, the bureau has adopted centralized management and unified usage of explosives. In all 12 counties and districts of the city, a comprehensive cleanup and confiscation of explosives have been conducted, removing 50 tons of dynamite, 30,800 detonators, and 35,500 meters of fuse that were scattered among the public. On this basis, according to the distribution of mines in each county and district, 165 explosive management stations have been established, with township heads and police station chiefs serving as leaders. Additionally, 3,313 experienced and politically reliable full-time blasters have been selected from a pool of over 5,000 candidates. All existing unqualified explosive storage facilities in the villages and teams have been sealed, and 481 new specialized explosive storage rooms have been built in safe locations. This has taken over the responsibilities of purchasing, transporting, and detonating explosives for all mines in the city, transforming the previous chaotic situation of "individual storage and scattered use" and the passive state of "uncontrolled explosives and police chasing after explosions." Last year, the number of explosion incidents in the city decreased by 46.3%, and the number of deaths decreased by 38.5%.

　　烟台公安局管理爆炸物品有新招    
    变分散管理为集中
    本报讯  一向令人头痛的民用爆炸物品管理工作，在深化改革中，被山东省烟台市公安局纳入法制轨道，从而大大减少了爆炸案件和死亡事故的发生。
    烟台市地处丘陵地带，矿山资源十分丰富，历来“靠山吃山”，使用爆炸物品开掘金矿、银矿、煤矿、铁矿、石矿等单位有数千个。过去由于产销和安全管理长期脱节，致使爆炸物品流失现象严重，成为社会治安的一大公害，每年因爆炸物品引起的人身伤亡、经济损失和报复、凶杀案件的数目，有增无减。
    近年来，该局对爆炸物品采取集中管理、统一使用的办法，在全市１２个县（市）区，进行了爆炸物品的收缴清查，把散失在民间的５０吨炸药、３０８００枚雷管和３５５００米导火索，全部清除归集。在此基础上，根据各县（市）区矿山的分布情况，组建起１６５个爆炸物品管理站，分别由乡镇长和公安派出所长出任领导；又从５０００多人中，考核、招聘了３３１３名有多年从事爆破经验、政治觉悟高、责任心强的专职爆破手；并对全市村队原有不合格的爆炸物品库全部封存，选择安全地段新建爆炸物品专用库４８１间；从而，担负起全市所有矿山开发中的购进、运输和爆破任务，一改过去那种“各自存放，分散使用”的混乱状况和“爆炸物品管得乱，干警围着响声转”的被动局面。去年，全市爆炸案件比上年下降４６．３％；死亡人数下降３８．５％。
