Analysts believe that Khomeini's reaffirmation of severe punishment for Rushdie is due to the fact that "The Satanic Verses" claims that parts of the Quran are not from Muhammad's teachings but from Satan's mouth. Additionally, a character in the book shares the same name as one of Muhammad's wives. According to Islamic law, insulting the Prophet must be atoned for with death.

Our correspondent Chen Te'an reports from London: According to reports, Ayatollah Khomeini issued a statement last night regarding the author of "The Satanic Verses," reiterating that Rushdie cannot be forgiven. Relations between Britain and Iran have once again become tense.

The British Foreign Office spokesman expressed "great concern" over Khomeini's statement last night, saying, "The British government will carefully consider the implications of the statement." Following the British Foreign Office's "serious" protest to Iran last week, British Foreign Secretary Howe emphasized that "Britain completely cannot accept" Khomeini's order to sentence the British-resident writer Rushdie to death.

Before Khomeini's statement, Iran's deputy foreign minister told Britain's chargé d'affaires in Iran, Nicholas Brown, that Rushdie's apology statement was "positive." However, why did Khomeini then reaffirm such severe punishment for Rushdie? Analysts here believe that, from a religious perspective, it is because "The Satanic Verses" insulted Prophet Muhammad and the Quran. The book claims that parts of the Quran are not from Muhammad's teachings but from Satan's mouth. The novel's characters include a prostitute who shares the same name as Muhammad's wife. According to Islamic law, insulting Muhammad is an unforgivable sin that must be atoned for with death. Of course, analysts also believe there are complex factors related to changes in the international political environment.

　　霍梅尼仍不原谅拉什迪
    分析家认为，霍梅尼重申严惩拉什迪，原因在于《撒旦的诗篇》说《古兰经》部分内容并非源于穆罕默德的圣训，而是出自撒旦（即魔鬼）之口。另外，书中的妓女与先知之妻同名。按伊斯兰教规，侮辱先知必须以死赎罪。
    本报伦敦２月２０日电　记者陈特安报道：据报道，阿亚图拉·霍梅尼昨晚就《撒旦的诗篇》一书作者的道歉发表声明，重申拉什迪不能被原谅。英伊两国关系再度紧张。
    英国外交部发言人昨晚对所获悉的霍梅尼的声明表示“极大关切”，他说：“英国政府将仔细考虑声明的含义”。继英外交部上周向伊朗提出“严重”抗议，英外交大臣豪强调“英国完全不能接受”霍梅尼对旅居英国作家拉什迪判处死刑的命令。
    在霍梅尼发表声明之前，伊朗副外长对英国驻伊朗代办尼古拉斯·布朗说，拉什迪的道歉声明是“积极的”。话音未落，霍梅尼为何又重申要对拉什迪实行如此严厉制裁？此间分析家认为，就宗教方面的原因而言，据称是因为《撒旦的诗篇》侮辱了先知穆罕默德及《古兰经》。书中说《古兰经》的部分内容并非源于穆罕默德的圣训，而是出自撒旦之口。书中的小说人物描写的是穆罕默德，其中的妓女与穆罕默德妻子同名。按伊斯兰教规，侮辱穆罕默德是不可饶恕的罪过，必须以死赎罪。当然，分析家还认为有国际政治环境变化方面的复杂因素。
