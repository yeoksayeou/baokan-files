The State Council's Economic, Technological, and Social Development Research Center, the State Commission for Economic Restructuring, the Ministry of Commerce, and other agencies jointly formed an investigation team. After more than a year of domestic and international investigations and research, it has been preliminarily decided to first establish the first batch of futures markets in Jilin, Sichuan, Henan, and Wuhan.

According to the person in charge of this work at the State Council's Economic, Technological, and Social Development Research Center, Liao Yingmin, the first batch of domestic futures markets will mainly trade agricultural products, including corn, wheat, cotton, silk, ramie, rabbit fur, live pigs, and other production materials such as steel.

A futures market is a place where standardized and transferable commodity forward contracts are bought and sold. Here, the buying and selling parties can buy or sell a certain type and quantity of products at a price agreed upon at the time of trading on a future specific date. Because the futures market has the functions of hedging and predicting and influencing future prices, the number of commodity varieties and quantities traded internationally is increasing.

In recent years, China has implemented a price liberalization policy in its economic reform, with a dual-track pricing system for some products. Due to imperfect reform measures, domestic agricultural product prices have experienced sharp fluctuations, with agricultural product supply being tight at times and loose at others. At the same time, urban commodity prices have surged significantly, and the government has had to increase fiscal subsidies. To change the current situation, the State Council leadership proposed the idea of establishing a futures market domestically.

Liao Yingmin said that establishing a futures market in China as soon as possible can bring the following benefits:

Stabilizing agricultural product prices and providing producers with accurate future market signals to help them reasonably formulate production plans. Because the production cycle of agricultural products is relatively long, arranging next year's planting area or breeding quantity based on the price signal when the product is marketed will cause large fluctuations in product prices and supply, making it easy for agricultural production and market supply to fall into a passive situation.

From the perspective of rectifying the overall economic order, establishing a futures market is of great significance. Currently, there are many irregular commercial regulations and systems in China's circulation sector, which to some extent affect the establishment of a normal economic order. However, the futures market has a set of strict and standardized management methods. Under its constraints, all transactions must be open and fair. By utilizing this feature, the existing market organization and regulations in China can be further improved.

The futures market also has the function of "hedging," which can protect the interests of commodity producers and operators.

### 国家决定开设第一批期货市场

　　国家决定开设第一批期货市场
    本报讯  据１３日出版的经济参考报道：由国务院经济技术社会发展研究中心、国家体制改革委员会、商业部等联合组成的调查组经过在国内外一年多的考察、调研，已初步确定首先在吉林、四川、河南、武汉等地开设第一批期货市场。
    据国务院经济技术社会发展研究中心负责此项工作的廖英敏介绍，首批在国内期货市场进行交易的主要是农产品，包括玉米、小麦、棉花、丝绸、苎麻、兔毛、生猪等，也会有钢材等生产资料入市。
    期货市场是买卖标准化和可转让的商品远期合约的场所。在这里，买卖双方能以交易时定的价格在将来某一特定日期买入或卖出某一种类和数量的产品。由于期货市场具有保值和预测、影响未来价格的功能，国际上通过其进行交易的商品品种和数量越来越多。
    近年来，我国在经济体制改革中实行了价格开放政策，对部分产品价格实行双轨制。由于改革措施不完善，使得国内农副产品价格出现了激烈的上下波动，农产品供应时紧时松。同时，城市商品价格大幅度上涨，政府不得不增加财政补贴。为改变目前这种局面，国务院领导提出了在国内建立期货市场的设想。
    廖英敏说，在我国尽早建起期货市场，可获如下好处：
    稳定农副产品价格，给生产者提供准确的未来市场信号，以利于合理地制定生产计划。因为农副产品生产周期较长，按产品上市时的价格信号安排来年的种植面积或饲养量，会造成产品价格和供货量的大起大落，容易给农业生产和市场供应带来被动局面。
    从整顿经济秩序的大环境看，建立期货市场有重要作用。目前在我国流通领域存在众多不规范的商业规章、制度等，在一定程度上影响正常经济秩序的建立。而期货市场有一套严格、规范的管理办法，受其约束，所有交易都必须是公开和公平的。利用这一特点，可进一步完善我国现有的市场组织和规章制度。
    期货市场还有“套期保值”的功能，对商品生产者和经营者的利益能起保护作用。
