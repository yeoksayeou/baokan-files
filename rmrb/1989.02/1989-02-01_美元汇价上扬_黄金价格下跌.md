The dollar exchange rate and stock market performance continued to be strong, while gold prices fell.

On the 30th, the Tokyo financial market saw notable movements, with the dollar-to-yen exchange rate briefly surpassing 1:130. By the close of trading, it dropped to 1:129.73, but still rose by 1.08 yen compared to the last trading day of the previous week (27th).

In the Frankfurt foreign exchange market, the dollar-to-West German Mark closing exchange rate increased from 1:1.8560 on the 27th to 1:1.8670.

On the New York Stock Exchange, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 1.25 points from the 27th's closing to 2324.11 points.

Due to the rise in the dollar exchange rate, gold prices fell. On the 27th of this month, the gold price in New York dropped to $395.25 per ounce, and yesterday it fell further to $394.50 per ounce.

According to Western financial experts, the dollar exchange rate has been rising steadily in recent periods mainly due to the increase in U.S. short-term interest rates. People believe that President Bush may take action to reduce the budget deficit. "The strength of the dollar is a phenomenon created by the market's hope in the U.S."

　　美元汇价上扬　黄金价格下跌
    新华社北京１月３１日电  美元汇价和股市行情继续坚挺，黄金价格下跌。
    ３０日东京金融市场行情引人注目，美元对日元的比价曾一度突破１∶１３０，到收盘时降到１∶１２９．７３，但仍比上周的最后一个交易日（２７日）上升１．０８日元。
    在法兰克福外汇市场，美元对西德马克的收盘比价由２７日的１∶１．８５６０上升到１∶１．８６７０。
    在纽约股票市场，道·琼斯３０种工业股票平均指数比２７日收盘时高１．２５点，达２３２４．１１点。
    由于美元汇价上扬，黄金价格下降。本月２７日纽约的黄金价格跌到每盎司３９５．２５美元，昨天又跌到３９４．５０美元一盎司。
    据西方金融界人士分析，近一个时期美元汇价持续上扬，主要是因美国短期利率上升，人们认为布什总统可能要采取行动来削减预算赤字。“美元坚挺是市场寄托希望（于美国）所创造出的一种现象”。
