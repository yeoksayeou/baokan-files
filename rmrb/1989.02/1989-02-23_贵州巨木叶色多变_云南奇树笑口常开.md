In Lianpo County, Laocun Township, Guizhou Province, there stands a giant yellow camphor tree. It is approximately 50 meters tall, with a trunk circumference of 38 meters, and its canopy covers an area of 400 square meters. Remarkably, this tree changes the color of its leaves according to the agricultural seasons: during the rice transplanting period, the leaves turn a light yellow; during the rice planting period, they become a fresh green; during the harvest season, they turn red; and when the fields are plowed in winter, the leaves return to green. Locals call this tree with its changing leaf colors the "Beautiful Monkey."

In Yunnan Province, on Yaojun Mountain in Jianchuan County, there grows a type of tree known as the "nanmu tree," which locals also refer to as the "Laughing Tree." If someone rubs their fingers against the tree trunk, the tree emits a "hahaha" laughing sound, and its branches sway, causing the fruits to split open and reveal the flesh inside, resembling faces with red lips and white teeth. Once the rubbing stops, the branches cease to move, the splits in the fruits close up, and the laughter stops.

　　贵州巨木叶色多变  云南奇树笑口常开
    贵州省荔波县捞村乡有一棵巨大的黄桷树，高约５０米，胸围３８米，遮荫达４００平方米。它能按耕耘时节多次变换树叶的颜色：撒秧时，树叶为浅黄；栽秧时，变为嫩绿；收割时，转成红色；晒冬犁田时，树叶复绿。当地人把这棵叶色多变的树称为“美猴”。
    云南省剑川县尧君山上，生长着一种“楠斗树”，当地人又称它为“哈哈树”。谁用指头磨擦树干，树身即发出“哈哈”笑声，随之枝叶舞动，果实裂开，果肉渐露，恰如张张唇红齿白的笑脸。磨擦一旦停止，树枝便立刻停止晃动，果实所裂开的口子竟同时闭合，笑声也随即停止。
