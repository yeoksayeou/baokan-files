The People's Liberation Army sent 244 medical teams, comprising 2,421 medical personnel, to 7 provinces and 15 old revolutionary bases in the spring of 1985. They have now completed their mission and returned to their units in late January and early February.

Over the course of four years, these medical teams, in cooperation with local health units, provided outpatient services to 1,430,000 people, treated 82,000 inpatients, performed 69,000 surgeries, and conducted free health check-ups for 1,740,000 elderly revolutionaries, military dependents, five-guarantee households, and school teachers and students. Additionally, they donated tens of thousands of items of clothing and medical equipment to the medical units in the old revolutionary bases.

The medical teams paid special attention to the prevention and treatment of local diseases and acute infectious diseases. The medical team sent to Zichang County in northern Shaanxi Province carried out rat and fly extermination activities, reducing the incidence of gastrointestinal infectious diseases from 30% to 5%. The medical teams also adopted various forms to cultivate medical personnel for the old revolutionary bases, leaving behind a medical team that will not leave.

　　送医四载　情满老区
    解放军医疗队载誉归营
    本报北京２月２５日讯  人民解放军于１９８５年春天派往７省１５个革命老区的２４４个医疗队、２４２１名医疗技术人员圆满完成预定任务，１月底２月初陆续回到部队。
    ４年中，这些医疗队在当地卫生单位的配合下，先后门诊１４３万多人次，收治病人８．２万多人次，做各种手术６．９万多人次，免费为老红军、烈军属、五保户、学校师生体检１７４万多人次。此外，向革命老区的医疗单位赠送了数以万计的被服和医疗器械。
    解放军医疗队特别注重防治地方病和急性传染病的工作。赴陕北子长县的医疗队开展灭鼠、灭蝇活动，使这里胃肠道传染病发病率由原来的３０％下降到５％。医疗队还采取多种形式，为革命老区培养医疗技术人才，留下一支不走的医疗队。
