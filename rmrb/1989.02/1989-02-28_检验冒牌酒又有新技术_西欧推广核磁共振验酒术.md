New technology for detecting counterfeit alcohol has emerged. Western European countries are promoting the use of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to combat this illegal activity.

Last year, the European Economic Community (EEC) officially adopted the use of nuclear magnetic resonance technology to separate and analyze the unique molecular structures and natural isotopes of alcohol. Currently, France, West Germany, and Italy are establishing laboratories equipped with this technology.

Nuclear magnetic resonance was originally used by chemists to analyze molecular structures. Later, it found applications in medicine, particularly in diagnosing diseases such as cancer. The principle behind NMR is that certain atomic nuclei behave like tiny magnets. When placed in a strong magnetic field, they align along the field's direction. If subjected to high-frequency radio wave pulses, these nuclei are knocked out of alignment. When the pulses cease, the nuclei return to their original state, emitting unique radio waves that can be detected by a receiver. Each type of atom has its characteristic radio frequency.

Using NMR technology to test alcohol involves measuring the degree to which hydrogen in certain molecules is replaced by its isotope deuterium. Due to the centrifugal force generated by the Earth's rotation, deuterium tends to concentrate near the equator. Therefore, the closer the geographical location of vineyards is to the equator, the higher the deuterium content in the grapes grown there.

    西欧推广核磁共振验酒术
    新华社伦敦２月２４日电  （记者王国瑞）西欧冒牌酒盛行，为了同这种不法行为作斗争，西欧各国正在采用先进的验酒技术。
    去年，欧洲共同体正式采用核磁共振分离分子特殊部位天然同位素的技术验酒。现在，法国、联邦德国和意大利正在建立这种实验室。
    核磁共振原来是化学家用来分析分子结构的，后来在医学上用于检查癌症等疾病。核磁共振的原理是：有些原子核像极小的磁铁，当置于强磁场中时，就沿磁场方向排列。如果用高频无线电波脉冲轰击原子核时，就把它轰出排列。当脉冲消失时，原子核又回到原来的排列状态，在这个过程中，原子核放出它特有的无线电波，用接收器能够测出来。每种原子都有它独特的无线电频率。
    用核磁共振技术验酒是测量某些分子中氢被它的同位素氘所取代的程度。由于地球自转产生的离心力使氘趋向赤道，因此栽种葡萄的地理位置靠赤道越近，其中的含氘量就越多。
