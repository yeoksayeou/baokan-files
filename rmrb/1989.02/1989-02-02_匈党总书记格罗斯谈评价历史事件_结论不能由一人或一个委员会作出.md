Hungarian Communist Party General Secretary Grosz emphasized that the conclusions on the reevaluation of certain events in Hungary over the past 40 years cannot be made by one person or a committee, but should be made by the Central Committee.

According to reports from local newspapers today, Grosz made these remarks on January 30 while on a flight back from Switzerland. He was responding to a speech given by Politburo member and State Secretary of the Hungarian government, Pozsgay, on January 28 on the radio. In his speech, Pozsgay revealed that a special committee of the Central Committee responsible for reviewing Hungary's post-liberation history had concluded that the 1956 Hungarian events were not a counter-revolutionary uprising but a "people's uprising."

Grosz said he read Pozsgay's speech on the plane from the "People's Freedom Newspaper" but did not know the details. He said the Central Committee had indeed established a working committee led by Pozsgay to draft documents for the 14th Party Congress, and the 1956 events were an unavoidable issue.

He said he did not understand what motivated Pozsgay to focus solely on the 1956 events in his analysis of the past 40 years of work.

He said, "Perhaps Pozsgay and this committee have materials that support such statements, but I have not yet come into contact with such materials."

Grosz pointed out: "We have said that we need to scientifically examine these 40 years and can re-evaluate some things. What political conclusions will emerge from a scientific analysis is uncertain, because political conclusions cannot be made by one person or a committee, but must be made by the Central Committee."

　　匈党总书记格罗斯谈评价历史事件
    结论不能由一人或一个委员会作出
    新华社布达佩斯１月３１日电  匈牙利社会主义工人党总书记格罗斯强调指出，对匈牙利过去４０年中某些事件重新评价的结论，不能由一个人或一个委员会做，而应当由中央委员会做。
    据此间报纸今天报道，格罗斯是１月３０日在访问瑞士回国途中的飞机上，针对匈党中央政治局委员、政府国务部长波日高伊１月２８日在广播电台的讲话，向匈牙利记者发表谈话时作上述表示的。波日高伊在讲话中曾透露，党中央的一个负责审查匈解放后历史的专门委员会认为，匈牙利１９５６年事件不是反革命事件，而是“人民起义”。
    格罗斯说，他是在飞机上从《人民自由报》读到波日高伊的讲话的，但不知道详细情况。他说，党中央确实成立了一个由波日高伊领导的工作委员会，其任务是为党的１４大起草文件，１９５６年事件是不可回避的问题。
    他说，他不明白，是什么出发点和动机支配波日高伊在对４０年来的工作的分析中只谈１９５６年这一部分。
    他说，他想波日高伊和这个委员会也许拥有作为这种说法的根据的材料，但他迄今尚未接触过这种材料。
    格罗斯指出：“我们曾说要科学地考察这４０年，也可以对有些事情重新进行评价。从科学的分析中将得出什么样的政治结论，事先无法断定，因为政治结论不能由一个人或一个委员会做，而要由中央来做。”
