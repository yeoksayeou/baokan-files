	Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Li Zhaoxing said today, "Vietnam's current claim of non-interference in Cambodian affairs is merely an attempt to shirk responsibility for the war and to continue controlling Cambodia by allowing Heng Samrin and Hun Sen to hold all the power."

	Li Zhaoxing made these remarks at a press conference this afternoon in response to a journalist's question. The journalist asked, "According to reports, the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry spokesperson stated that Cambodian internal affairs must be resolved by the Cambodian people themselves, and that foreign countries should not interfere. What is your comment on this?"

	Li Zhaoxing said, "The entire Cambodian issue was entirely caused by Vietnam's invasion. Therefore, Vietnam bears an unshirkable responsibility for the comprehensive resolution of the Cambodian issue, including the prompt and complete withdrawal of Vietnamese troops and the realization of peace in Cambodia after the withdrawal. Vietnam invaded and occupied Cambodia, waging a decade-long war of aggression, and has been interfering in Cambodian internal affairs in the most severe and brutal manner."

	He said, "If Vietnam truly has the intention to resolve the Cambodian issue, it should take concrete actions that help achieve a comprehensive, fair, and reasonable political resolution to the Cambodian issue. Not only should it withdraw all troops from Cambodia under strict and effective international supervision, but it should also promote reconciliation and unity among the four parties in Cambodia to truly achieve peace in Cambodia, rather than creating civil war and chaos in any form."

	When asked about his evaluation of the efforts made by the Arab League's mediation committee to resolve the Lebanese crisis, the spokesperson said, "China appreciates the efforts made by the Arab League's mediation committee to resolve the Lebanese issue. China hopes that all parties in Lebanon will prioritize national interests, actively cooperate with the mediation committee's efforts, and, in the spirit of mutual understanding and compromise, resolve differences and disputes through equal consultations to achieve national unity and stability in Lebanon as soon as possible."

### 我外交部发言人指出  越南所谓的不干涉柬埔寨内政  不过是企图推卸侵略战争责任

　　我外交部发言人指出
    越南所谓的不干涉柬埔寨内政
    不过是企图推卸侵略战争责任
    新华社北京２月２日电外交部发言人李肇星今天在这里说，“今天越南所谓的不干涉柬埔寨内政，不过是企图推卸战争责任并通过让韩桑林——洪森独揽大权继续控制柬埔寨。”
    李肇星是在今天下午的新闻发布会上回答记者提问时说这番话的。有记者问，“据报道，越南外交部发言人称，柬埔寨内部问题必须由柬埔寨人民自己解决，外国不得干涉。你对此有何评论？”
    李肇星说，整个柬埔寨问题完全是越南派兵入侵造成的，因此越南对全面解决柬埔寨问题，包括越南尽快真正地全部撤军和撤军后实现柬埔寨国内和平，负有不可推卸的责任。越南派兵侵占柬埔寨，在柬埔寨打了长达十年之久的侵略战争，一直在对柬埔寨内政进行最严重、最粗暴的干涉。
    他说，越南如真有解决柬埔寨问题的诚意，就应该采取有助于柬埔寨问题全面公正合理的政治解决的切实行动，不仅在严格有效的国际监督下真正地从柬埔寨全部撤军，而且促进柬埔寨四方实现和解和联合，以在柬埔寨真正实现和平，而不要以任何形式在柬埔寨制造内战和动乱。
    当记者问他对阿拉伯联盟解决黎巴嫩危机调解委员会所做的努力有何评价时，这位发言人说，中国对阿拉伯联盟调解委员会为解决黎巴嫩问题所做的努力表示赞赏。中国希望黎巴嫩各方以民族利益为重，积极配合调解委员会的努力，本着互谅互让的精神，通过平等协商，消除分歧和争端，早日实现黎巴嫩的民族团结与稳定。
