Recently, when my factory purchased production materials, the supplier insisted that we bring cash to buy the goods. Since the payment amount was tens of millions of yuan, my factory had no way to raise the funds.

In recent years, such incidents of violating cash management regulations and conducting large-cash transactions have occurred frequently and are becoming more rampant. The harm caused by this practice is significant: first, it increases the social money supply, disrupting financial planning; second, it provides convenience for embezzlement, theft, and misappropriation of public funds, increasing the difficulty of maintaining social order; third, it opens the door for certain units to arbitrarily issue money and goods, and to squander public funds on banquets and gifts.

I believe that relevant departments should take measures to stop large-cash transactions. Tackling this issue is of great importance for preventing impulsive spending, consolidating reform achievements, and stabilizing the social economic order.

### 巨额现金购销的弊病

　　巨额现金购销的弊病
    最近，我厂购买生产原料，供方竟要我厂带现金去购货。因货款额达数十万元，我厂根本无处筹取。
    近年来，这种违反现金管理制度，以巨额现金进行购销活动的事，屡有发生，而且愈演愈烈。这样做的危害很大：一是增加社会货币流通量，干扰金融计划；二是为贪污、盗窃、挪用公款提供了方便，增加了社会治安工作的难度；三是为某些单位擅自滥发钱物、用公款请客送礼等铺张挥霍行为大开了方便之门。
    我认为，有关部门应设法制止用巨额现金进行购销的活动。抓紧抓好这项工作，对防止突击花钱，巩固改革成果，稳定社会经济秩序，都有十分重要的意义。
