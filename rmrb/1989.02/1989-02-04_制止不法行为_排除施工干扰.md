The Jiao-Zhi (Jiaozuo-Zhicheng) double-track upgrade project is a national key project with a total investment of 130 million yuan. The 11th Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, responsible for the double-track construction of the Luoyang (Luo)-Nanyang (Nan) section from Jiu Li Shan to Xia Zhuang, has faced frequent disruptions from local villagers since the project began.

Theft of railway materials is rampant. On August 10, 1988, when the track laying began between Jiu Li Shan and Dong Zhuang, a large amount of urgently needed materials were stolen. Statistics show that over the past two years, there have been more than 40 cases of material theft, valued at tens of thousands of yuan.

Extortion and blackmail have affected construction. On November 19, 1988, workers from the 4th Brigade of the 11th Bureau were replacing rails at the south channel of Dong Zhuang Station and accidentally damaged a few rows of wheat seedlings within the acquired land. Officials from Tan Zhuang, Guangdian Township, Fangcheng County, Henan Province, demanded 1,000 yuan in compensation from the construction unit.

Relevant departments should promptly stop illegal activities and eliminate construction interference.

　　制止不法行为　排除施工干扰
    焦（作）枝（城）复线改造工程是国家重点工程，总投资１３亿元。铁道部十一工程局一处负责焦枝复线洛（阳）南（阳）段九里山至夏庄区间复线施工以来，驻地的一些村民经常干些影响工程进度的事。
    盗窃铁路物资现象严重。１９８８年８月１０日，九里山至董庄开始铺轨，但工程急需的物资大量被盗。据统计，两年来共发生盗窃物资案４０多起，价值数万元。
    敲诈勒索影响施工。１９８８年１１月１９日，一处四队职工在董庄车站南道口换钢轨时，砸坏了被征购土地内的几行麦苗。河南方城县广店乡谭庄有关人员竟要施工单位赔偿１０００元。
    有关部门应尽快制止不法行为，排除施工干扰。
