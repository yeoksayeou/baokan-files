Today, we mourn with deep sorrow the passing of our great patriot, renowned statesman, loyal friend of the Communist Party of China, outstanding leader of Tibetan Buddhism, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Seventh National People's Congress, Honorary President of the Chinese Buddhist Association, and the Tenth Panchen Erdeni, Qoinjye Gyatso. Panchen Vice Chairman was born on February 3, 1938 (the third day of the first month of the Year of the Earth Tiger in the 16th Rabjung cycle) in Wendu Township, Xunhua County, Qinghai Province, into a Tibetan peasant family. At the age of three, he was recognized as the reincarnation of the Ninth Panchen Lama. On June 3, 1949, he was approved by the then National Government as the Tenth Panchen Erdeni. After the national liberation, Panchen Lama held various important positions, including Member of the Standing Committee of the First National People's Congress, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Second, Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh National People's Congresses, Vice Chairman of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Member of the Standing Committee of the Third and Fourth National Committees of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Vice Chairman of the Fifth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and various key positions in the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, including Deputy Chairman, Acting Chairman, and Chairman. This year, after presiding over the opening ceremony of the Panchen Eastern Mausoleum, which houses the relics of the Fifth to Ninth Panchen Lamas in Shigatse City, he suffered a heart attack due to overwork and passed away at 20:16 on January 28, 1989, at the age of 51.

Panchen Vice Chairman's life was dedicated to the struggle for the unity and strength of our great motherland. Particularly in the struggle against separatism in Tibet, he stood firmly on the side of patriotism for decades, making indelible contributions to maintaining national unity and strengthening ethnic solidarity.

On October 1, 1949, the People's Republic of China was established. Panchen Vice Chairman immediately sent a telegram to Chairman Mao Zedong and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De, enthusiastically praising the establishment of the People's Republic of China, expressing his hope that "the people's happiness is in sight, and the nation's revival is assured," and declaring his support and admiration for the Communist Party and the people's government. This patriotic action represented the common will of Tibetan patriots and the broad masses of the people, and was highly praised by Chairman Mao Zedong and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De.

In April 1951, when the representatives of the Central People's Government and the local government of Tibet were negotiating in Beijing on the matter of the peaceful liberation of Tibet, he personally went to Beijing to actively support and promote the negotiations. On May 23, the Central People's Government and the local government of Tibet signed the "Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet." On May 24, he led the main officials of the Panchen Lama's office to pay their respects to Chairman Mao Zedong and issued a statement, enthusiastically supporting the agreement and vowing to "for the thorough liberation and development of the Tibetan people, for the consolidation and development of the victory of the Chinese people, to firmly support the leadership of Chairman Mao, to support the leadership of the Central People's Government and the Communist Party of China, to correctly implement all the agreements, and to strive for the unity of the Tibetan people with the Chinese people and the unity within the Tibetan people." Thereafter, he took an active and proactive attitude in handling historical issues within Tibet, playing an important role in the decision to establish the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region during the First Session of the First National People's Congress in 1954, and in the joint visit to Beijing by him and the Dalai Lama.

In November 1956, he was invited to India to participate in the 2500th anniversary of the Parinirvana of Sakyamuni. In various places in India, he clearly emphasized the traditional friendship between China and India and between the two peoples, and emphasized the need to abide by the "Seventeen-Point Agreement," demonstrating his upright and patriotic stance in practice.

In March 1959, when the upper-class reactionary clique in Tibet openly tore up the "Seventeen-Point Agreement" and launched an armed rebellion, he stood firmly on the side of the country and the people, resolutely fighting against the rebels. On March 28, Premier Zhou Enlai issued an order to dissolve the original local government of Tibet and to have the Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region exercise local government powers, appointing him as the Acting Chairman of the Preparatory Committee. On March 29, he immediately sent a telegram to Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier Zhou Enlai, firmly supporting the decision of the State Council, and hurriedly went from Shigatse to Lhasa to preside over the work of the Tibet Autonomous Region Preparatory Committee. Thereafter, the Preparatory Committee formulated a series of policies and measures for suppressing the rebellion and democratic reform, making important contributions to the fundamental transformation of Tibetan society and the liberation of the people.

From 1987 to 1988, a few separatist elements colluded with external separatist forces to create several disturbances in Lhasa. Panchen Vice Chairman repeatedly issued statements, strongly condemning the separatist elements for creating disturbances and splitting the country. Panchen Vice Chairman once said, "My stance on defending national unity is unshakable. I have opposed, am opposing, and will continue to oppose the splitting of the country. I am willing to make the greatest sacrifice for the great cause of defending national unity." Panchen Vice Chairman is indeed a great patriot.

Panchen Vice Chairman was a renowned statesman who cared about national affairs and devoted all his efforts to maintaining and developing China's socialist national relations of equality, unity, and mutual assistance, to the development and progress of Tibet, to the prosperity of the country and the prosperity of the nation, to the friendship between the Chinese people and the peoples of the world, and to the maintenance of world peace.

He served as a member of the Constitutional Amendment Committee and made many important suggestions during the review and amendment of the Constitution. During the review of various laws by the National People's Congress, he always thought carefully and proposed important amendments based on actual conditions.

He firmly supported the policies and guidelines proposed by the Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee, supported the line of the Thirteenth National Congress, and supported reform and opening up. He repeatedly emphasized that the progress of the country cannot be separated from reform and opening up, and the prosperity of Tibet cannot be separated from reform and opening up.

He paid great attention to the implementation of the "Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy" in Tibet and made many pertinent suggestions and proposals; he actively assisted the Party in implementing ethnic policies, religious policies, united front policies, and other policies, doing a great deal of work; he emphasized the importance of maintaining and strengthening unity between the Han and Tibetan nationalities and among all nationalities in China, stressing that Tibetans cannot do without the Han, and the Han cannot do without the Tibetans, and making unremitting efforts to maintain and strengthen national unity; he cared deeply about the economic and cultural construction of Tibet, proposing the establishment of the "Tibet Development Assistance Fund" and personally serving as the Chairman of the Committee; he attached great importance to preserving and carrying forward the fine traditional culture of the Tibetan nationality, and together with Vice Chairman Alphie Awang Jinmei, he proposed important suggestions on strengthening the learning and use of the Tibetan language, which were fully valued by the Party and government leaders of the Autonomous Region. In 1987, the Autonomous Region People's Congress passed the "Several Provisions on Learning, Using, and Developing the Tibetan Language" (Trial). Over the past decade, his inspection work has covered the entire country and almost the entire Tibet and other Tibetan areas. Everywhere he went, he proposed pertinent suggestions based on the actual situation at the time and place, playing an important role in improving work and winning the respect and admiration of the broad masses of cadres and the people.

He led the National People's Congress delegation to visit Nepal, Australia, Brazil, Bolivia, and Uruguay, and often received foreign guests at home. In these state activities, he introduced China's national conditions and the Party's policies and guidelines to foreign friends in a realistic manner, especially the Party's policy of freedom of religious belief and the achievements of Tibet's construction, speaking both of achievements and shortcomings, in a lively and detailed manner, winning the respect and admiration of foreign friends.

Panchen Vice Chairman was a sincere friend and critic of the Party. For decades, he firmly supported the leadership of the Communist Party of China, truly achieving unity with the Party in times of honor and disgrace. He repeatedly reaffirmed his firm belief in loving the Communist Party of China in various occasions and put it into practice. In various historical periods after the founding of the People's Republic of China, he could speak out frankly on some major issues to the Party, playing an important role in the Party's decision-making on the Tibet issue. He was frank and generous, daring to put forward his own opinions for the interests of the country and the nation, truly achieving the principle of speaking without reservation and speaking without hesitation.

In the mid-1960s, due to the "leftist" errors, he was treated unfairly, especially during the "Cultural Revolution," when he, like other Party and state leaders, suffered cruel persecution at the hands of the "Gang of Four." But his sincere heart towards the Party and the country never wavered. When the Central Committee decided to fully rehabilitate him, he calmly said, "I have long believed that this day would come."

Panchen Vice Chairman was an outstanding leader of Tibetan Buddhism. On the one hand, he actively assisted the Party and the government in implementing the policy of freedom of religious belief, protecting the legitimate rights and interests of temples and monks and nuns; on the other hand, he adapted to the development of society, doing a lot of beneficial work to make Tibetan Buddhism gradually adapt to China's socialist system. During the democratic reform in Tibet, he was the first to propose the idea of "constitution into the temple" regarding the feudal privileges in the temple, and wrote it into the resolution of the Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region, which played a very important role in the democratic reform of the temple. He repeatedly said that the temple is not about quantity, but about truly meeting the religious needs of believers and becoming a place to propagate the Buddha Dharma and do good deeds; monks and nuns are not about quantity, but about quality, truly following the teachings of Sakyamuni, observing the rules and disciplines, studying the esoteric and exoteric doctrines, inheriting the spirit of Sakyamuni, and carrying it forward. To this end, he personally presided over the pilot project of temple management under socialist conditions in his main temple, the Tashilhunpo Monastery, and gained some valuable experience. He often educated his followers to be devout in their faith and to love their country and work for the people's well-being. He established the Chinese Tibetan Language Higher Buddhist Academy to cultivate Buddhist scholars who are politically supportive of the Communist Party's leadership, love their country, follow the socialist path, and have a high level of religious knowledge, setting a good example.

On January 22 of this year, in his speech at the opening ceremony of the Panchen Eastern Mausoleum, which houses the relics of the Fifth to Ninth Panchen Lamas, he made his last formal speech. In this speech, he highly praised the glorious tradition of the Fifth to Ninth Panchen Lamas in loving the country and maintaining national unity; praised the Party's religious policy; praised the great unity between the Han and Tibetan nationalities, and reaffirmed his belief in loving the Party, loving the country, loving the religion, and loving the people. This speech is an important spiritual legacy left by Panchen Vice Chairman to the broad masses of monks and laypeople.

The passing of Panchen Vice Chairman is a great loss to our country, losing a great patriot and statesman; it is a great loss to our Party, losing a loyal friend; it is a great loss to the Tibetan people, losing an outstanding religious leader. This is a major loss for the Party and the country, and a major loss for the people of all ethnic groups in the country, including the Tibetan people. Panchen Vice Chairman often said that loving the Communist Party of China, loving the country, loving his own nationality, and loving his own religion is his lifelong belief. We mourn the respected Panchen Vice Chairman, continue to seriously implement the various policies and guidelines formulated by the Party Central Committee for Tibet, care about the development and progress of Tibet and the Tibetan people; continue to implement the Party's policy of freedom of religious belief. We mourn the respected Panchen Vice Chairman, turn our sorrow into strength, learn from and carry forward the noble character and high moral character of Panchen Vice Chairman, strive for the unity of the country, strengthen national unity, for the construction of a united, prosperous, and civilized socialist new Tibet, and for the prosperity of all nationalities.

Panchen Erdeni Qoinjye Gyatso Vice Chairman will be immortal!

　　在二月十五日班禅副委员长追悼会上
  　万里委员长致悼词
    今天，我们怀着无比沉痛的心情，深切悼念我国伟大的爱国主义者、著名的国务活动家、中国共产党的忠诚朋友、中国藏传佛教的杰出领袖、第七届全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长、中国佛教协会名誉会长、第十世班禅额尔德尼·确吉坚赞大师。
    班禅副委员长１９３８年２月３日（藏历十六绕迥之土虎年正月初三日）生于青海省循化县文都乡一个藏族农民家庭。三岁时被选定为第九世班禅的转世灵童，１９４９年６月３日，被当时的国民政府批准为第十世班禅额尔德尼。全国解放后，班禅大师历任第一届全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员，第二、五、六、七届全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长，第二届全国政协副主席，第三、四届全国政协常务委员，第五届全国政协副主席，西藏自治区筹备委员会常务委员、第一副主任委员、代理主任委员等重要职务。今年１月，他在主持日喀则市扎什伦布寺第五世至九世班禅遗体合葬灵塔祀殿——班禅东陵扎什南捷开光典礼后，因操劳过度，心脏病突发，不幸于１９８９年１月２８日２０时１６分逝世，终年５１岁。
    班禅副委员长的一生是为我们伟大祖国的统一和富强而奋斗的一生。尤其是在西藏分裂与反分裂的斗争中，他几十年如一日，旗帜鲜明地坚持爱国主义立场，为维护祖国统一，增强民族团结，建立了不可磨灭的功绩。
    １９４９年１０月１日中华人民共和国成立。班禅副委员长即致电毛泽东主席和朱德总司令，热情地颂扬中华人民共和国的成立，使“人民之康乐可期，国家之复兴有望”，表达了对共产党和人民政府“拥护爱戴之忱”。他的这种爱国行动，代表了藏族爱国人士和广大人民群众的共同意志，受到了毛泽东主席和朱德总司令的高度赞扬。
    １９５１年４月，当中央人民政府代表同西藏地方政府代表在北京就和平解放西藏事宜进行谈判时，他亲临北京，积极支持和推动谈判。５月２３日中央人民政府同西藏地方政府签订了《关于和平解放西藏办法的协议》，５月２４日，他即率班禅堪布会议厅主要官员向毛泽东主席致敬，并发表声明，热烈拥护协议，矢志“为了西藏民族的彻底解放和发展，为了巩固和发展中国人民的胜利，今后坚决拥护毛主席的领导，拥护中央人民政府和中国共产党的领导，为正确执行全部协议，为西藏民族与中国各民族的团结和西藏民族内部的团结而奋斗。”此后，他为了祖国统一、民族团结和西藏内部团结，在处理西藏内部的历史悬案问题上，采取积极主动的态度，为促成１９５４年他同达赖喇嘛联袂来北京出席第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议，并协商达成关于成立西藏自治区筹备委员会的决议，起了重要作用。
    １９５６年１１月，他应邀去印度参加释迦牟尼涅槃２５００周年纪念活动。在印度各地，他旗帜鲜明地强调了中印两国和两国人民的传统友谊，强调了要遵守《十七条协议》，以实际行动表明了他光明磊落的爱国立场。
    １９５９年３月，当西藏上层反动集团公然撕毁《十七条协议》，发动武装叛乱时，他正气凛然地站在祖国和人民一边，同叛乱分子进行了坚决的斗争。３月２８日，周恩来总理发布命令，解散原西藏地方政府，由自治区筹备委员会行使地方政府职权，并任命他为自治区筹委会代理主任委员。３月２９日，他立即致电毛泽东主席和周恩来总理，坚决拥护国务院的决定，并立刻从日喀则赶到拉萨，主持西藏自治区筹委会的工作。此后筹委会通过了一系列有关平叛和民主改革的方针、政策，为西藏社会的根本变革和人民翻身解放做出了重要贡献。
    １９８７年至１９８８年少数分裂主义分子与国外分裂势力相勾结，在拉萨制造了几次骚乱事件。班禅副委员长多次发表讲话，坚决谴责分裂主义分子制造骚乱和分裂祖国的行径。班禅副委员长曾多次讲：“我维护祖国统一的立场是坚定不移的，对于分裂祖国的行径，我过去反对，现在反对，将来也反对，我愿为维护祖国统一的伟大事业做出最大的牺牲。”班禅副委员长作为一个伟大的爱国主义者是当之无愧的。
    班禅副委员长是著名的国务活动家，他关心国家大事，为维护和发展我国平等、团结、互助的社会主义民族关系，为西藏的发展、进步，为国家的富强和民族的繁荣，为中国人民同世界各国人民的友谊，为维护世界和平竭尽了全力。
    他担任过宪法修改委员会委员，在审议、修改宪法时，提出过许多重要意见。在全国人大审议各项法律时，他总是认真思考，联系实际提出重要的修改意见。
    他坚决拥护党的十一届三中全会提出的各项方针、政策，拥护党的十三大路线，拥护改革、开放。他多次强调，国家的进步离不开改革、开放，西藏的繁荣同样离不开改革、开放。
    他十分关心《民族区域自治法》在西藏的贯彻执行，提出过许多中肯的意见和建议；他积极协助党落实民族政策、宗教政策、统战政策和其他各项政策，做了大量工作；他十分重视和强调维护汉藏民族之间和我国各民族之间的团结，强调藏族离不开汉族，汉族也离不开藏族，为维护和加强民族团结做出了不懈的努力；他非常关怀西藏的经济、文化建设，提议成立了“援助西藏发展基金会”，并亲自担任主任委员；他注重保持和发扬藏民族的优良传统文化，同阿沛·阿旺晋美副委员长一起提出了关于加强学习和使用藏语文的重要建议，得到自治区党、政领导同志的充分重视。１９８７年自治区人大会议通过了《关于学习、使用、发展藏语文的若干规定》（试行）。近十年来，他视察工作的足迹遍及祖国大江南北和几乎整个西藏以及其他藏区。每到一地，他都根据当时、当地的实际情况，提出中肯的意见和建议，对改进工作起了重要作用，深得广大干部、群众的拥戴和尊敬。
    他曾率领全国人大代表团出访尼泊尔、澳大利亚、巴西、玻利维亚、乌拉圭等国，并经常在国内会见外宾。在这些国务活动中，他实事求是地向外国友人介绍我国的国情和党的方针、政策，特别是党的宗教信仰自由政策和西藏的建设成就，既讲成绩，又讲不足，语言生动，内容详实，博得了外国友人的敬重和钦佩。
    班禅副委员长是同党真诚合作共事的一位难得的挚友和诤友。他几十年如一日，坚定地拥护中国共产党的领导，真正做到了同党肝胆相照，荣辱与共。他在各种场合一再重申他热爱中国共产党的坚定信念，并且身体力行。在中华人民共和国建国后的各个历史时期，他都能在一些重大问题上直言不讳地向党陈述意见和观点，对党在西藏问题上的决策起了重要作用。他为人坦诚、豪爽，为了国家和民族的利益，敢于坦率地提出自己的意见，真正做到了知无不言，言无不尽。
    在６０年代中期，由于“左”的错误，他受到了不公正的对待，尤其是在“文化大革命”中，他与党和国家的其他一些领导人一样遭受到“四人帮”的残酷的迫害。但他对党和国家的赤诚之心从未动摇过。当中央决定给他彻底平反时，他平静地说，“我早就坚信会有这一天”。
    班禅副委员长是藏传佛教的杰出领袖。他一方面积极协助党和政府贯彻宗教信仰自由政策，维护寺庙和僧尼的合法权益，一方面顺应社会的发展，为使藏传佛教能逐步同我国的社会主义制度相适应，做了许多有益的工作。西藏民主改革时，是他首先针对寺庙中存在的封建特权，提出了宪法进寺庙的主张，并写进了自治区筹备委员会的决议中，这对寺庙的民主改革起到了十分重要的作用。他曾多次反复讲，寺庙不在多，而在于能够真正满足信教群众宗教生活的需要，成为弘扬佛法、弃恶行善的场所；僧尼不在多，而在于素质高，真正能遵循释迦牟尼的训诫，信守教规教律，研习显密教义，把释迦牟尼的精神继承下来，发扬光大。为此，他在他的主寺扎什伦布寺亲自主持进行了在社会主义条件下寺庙管理的试点，取得了一些很有价值的经验。他经常教育信徒既要虔诚信教，又要热爱祖国，为人民谋福利。他为了整饬藏传佛教，亲自创办了中国藏语系高级佛学院，并担任院长，为培养政治上拥护共产党领导，热爱祖国，走社会主义道路，宗教上有较高造诣的佛教知识分子开创了良好的范例。
    今年１月２２日，他在第五世至九世班禅遗体合葬灵塔祀殿班禅东陵扎什南捷开光典礼上的讲话，是他生前的最后一次正式讲话。在这篇讲话中，他高度赞扬了五世至九世班禅热爱祖国、维护民族团结的光荣传统；赞扬了党的宗教政策；赞扬了汉藏民族的大团结，重申了他爱党、爱国、爱教、爱人民的信念。这篇讲话是班禅副委员长留给广大僧俗群众的重要精神财富。
    班禅副委员长的逝世，使我们国家失去了一位伟大的爱国主义者和国务活动家；使我们党失去了一位忠诚的朋友；使藏族人民失去了一位杰出的爱国宗教领袖。这是党和国家的重大损失，是包括藏族人民在内的全国各族人民的重大损失。班禅副委员长生前多次讲过，热爱中国共产党，热爱祖国，热爱自己的民族，热爱自己信仰的宗教，是他终生不渝的信念。我们悼念敬爱的班禅副委员长，要继续认真贯彻执行党中央为西藏制定的各项方针、政策，关心西藏和藏族人民的发展、进步；继续贯彻执行党的宗教信仰自由政策。我们悼念敬爱的班禅副委员长，要化悲痛为力量，学习和发扬班禅副委员长的优良品德和高尚情操，为维护祖国统一，增强民族团结，为建设团结、富裕、文明的社会主义新西藏，为促进各民族的共同繁荣而奋斗。
    班禅额尔德尼·确吉坚赞副委员长永垂不朽！
