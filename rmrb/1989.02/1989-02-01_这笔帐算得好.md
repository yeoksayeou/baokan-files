Title: The Account is Well Calculated

The account kept by farmer Zhou Shuyuan is fair and convincing. His two brothers, who originally insisted on selling grain and cotton at high prices in the market, changed their minds after hearing his reasoning.

Some people think that it's impossible to calculate the accounts now. Buying high-priced production materials and selling low-priced agricultural products, how can farmers not suffer a loss? Is that really the case? Zhou Shuyuan's account not only calculates the losses farmers suffer but also the gains they make. It is not just about calculating losses but not gains; rather, it is about looking at the problem from a comprehensive perspective. In this way, farmers are not necessarily at a disadvantage everywhere.

Calculating accounts cannot be done without comparison. Some people's comparison results show that the cost of farming has increased so much, and the price of grain and cotton has increased so little, so why sell grain and cotton at the state-set price? However, Zhou Shuyuan's comparison results are different. The cost of farming has indeed increased significantly, but the increase in grain and cotton yield per unit area and total yield is even greater. Although selling at a low price to the state is a loss, considering that there are still many agricultural products sold at negotiated and high prices, this means there are losses and gains. His account calculates both small and large accounts, compares both the present and the past, and concludes that farmers are suffering small losses but gaining big benefits. This conclusion should be correct.

Of course, no matter how the accounts are calculated and compared, the fact that "the benefits of growing grain and cotton are relatively low" cannot be denied. Now, the state has seen the existing problems and has started to address them. Of course, adjusting grain and cotton prices is not easy; it affects the whole system, and solving the problem must take time. The prudent and meticulous Zhou Shuyuan saw some irrationalities in the prices and at the same time advised his brothers, "You can't be too impatient." His words reflect the spirit of dedication of contemporary farmers, which is indeed rare.

　　这笔帐算得好
    万兴
    农民周书元的三笔帐算得公道，也能以理服人，他两个原本坚持要把粮棉拿到市场上卖高价的弟弟，听了也都改变了初衷。
    有人认为，如今的帐没有办法算。买高价生产资料，卖低价农副产品，怎么算农民也是吃了大亏。果真如此吗？周书元的帐既把农民吃的亏算到了，也把农民获的利算到了。不是只计亏，不计盈，而是用全面的观点看问题。如此算来，农民也并非处处吃亏。
    算帐，离不开对比。一些人对比的结果是，种田成本提高了那么多，粮棉价格又增加得那么少，为什么要卖平价粮棉给国家？可是周书元对比的结果却不一样，种田成本是大幅度增长了，可粮棉单产、总产增加幅度更大。虽然低价卖给国家是吃亏，但考虑到还有不少农产品卖了议价、高价，这说明有亏也有盈啊。他的这笔帐既算小帐又算大帐，既比眼前又比过去，得出的结论是，农民还是吃小亏得大利。这个结论应该说是正确的。
    当然，不管怎样算帐，怎样对比，目前“种粮棉的效益确实比较低”，这是个不可否认的事实。现在，国家已经看到了存在的问题，并已着手解决。当然，理顺粮棉价格很不容易，牵一发动全局，解决问题必须有个过程。善于精打细算的周书元看到了价格的某些不合理，同时又劝自己的兄弟“不能太性急”。他的这番话反映了当代农民的奉献精神，实在难能可贵。
