The sky was overcast, and the cold wind was biting. Standing on Fengshuling in Wugong Mountain, Jiangxi, and looking south, one could see more than 20 hills in the distance, covering over 1,600 mu of cypress forest, still lush and green, making one reluctant to leave. A middle-aged man was leading his family up this mountain. He was tall and thin, in his thirties, with thick lips slightly curled, and a smiling face. This ordinary farmer was named Liao Jisheng, the owner of the 1,600 mu of cypress forest and a national afforestation labor model.

Fengshuling had more stones and less soil, with vines and weeds growing everywhere. The nearby villagers watched Liao Jisheng bring his family to afforest this barren mountain, all shaking their heads. Liao Jisheng had his own reasoning: Chairman Mao Zedong led the Autumn Harvest Uprising troops from here to Jinggangshan. If the revolutionary forebears could fight for the country, why couldn't we, the later generations, afforest the barren mountains and build the country?

He insisted on reclaiming the land, leading his family up the mountain every day at dawn, working for over 10 hours each day. Two years later, the 222 mu of responsibility mountains Liao Jisheng contracted were all planted with cypress trees, and all the trees survived.

One day in the winter of 1984, Liao Jisheng went down the mountain to his home. On the way, he saw dense cypress forests, and his mind started to calculate: in 10 years, one mu would yield at least 4,000 yuan. The whole township had so many barren mountains. If all of them were reclaimed and planted with cypress forests, the income would be enormous! As the saying goes, "Rely on the mountains to eat." He had a bold idea: to contract barren mountains across villages and townships for afforestation.

He visited villages and households, negotiating with farmers whose responsibility mountains were adjacent to his. Seeing that his 200-plus mu of cypress forests had all survived, the neighbors trusted him and were all willing to let him contract their land. The district and township governments and the forestry department also gave strong support. Soon, he signed a contract with 21 households in 7 villages across 3 townships to afforest 1,400 mu of barren mountains.

In the winter of 1984, Liao Jisheng led his workers to start large-scale reclamation and afforestation. He was like a commander, dividing 100-plus people into eight groups, each with a stove and cooking utensils, and arranging meals. If the workers had no rice, they could come to his home to fetch it; if they had no vegetables, they could pick them from his garden. In a few months, his family's accumulated grain was all eaten, and he even owed some debts. Liao Jisheng himself was thinner than before. At this time, some people in society praised him, while others mocked him: "Spending money on barren mountains is foolish." Liao Jisheng was clear in his mind: planting thousands of mu of forests, in 15 years, at least 20 million yuan could be earned, averaging tens of millions of yuan per year. A person should not be shortsighted but should look far ahead.

Now, the 1,622 mu of cypress forest contracted by Liao Jisheng has trees growing to 2-3 meters high, with the larger ones having a circumference of 5-6 inches. According to the forestry department, in 15 years, one mu will not be less than 7 cubic meters. Calculated at 1,000 yuan per cubic meter, one mu will yield 7,000 yuan, and 1,622 mu will yield 11.35 million yuan; after deducting costs, a net profit of 34 million yuan can be obtained. The rolling cypress waves on Fengshuling seem to be playing a beautiful and melodious song.

　　一千六百亩杉林的主人
    江西  贺益坚
    天色阴沉，寒风凛冽。站在江西武功山的枫树岭上向南眺望，远近２０多个山头，１６００多亩杉林，仍苍翠欲滴，令人流连忘返。一个中年汉子领着妻小正在这座山上。他瘦长身材，３０多岁年纪，厚厚的嘴唇微微卷起，脸上笑容可掬。这位普通农民叫廖吉生，是这１６００亩杉林的主人，全国绿化劳动模范。
    枫树岭石多泥少，勾藤蔓地，茅草丛生。附近的村民当年看着廖吉生带着一家人在这荒山上造林，无不摇头。廖吉生自有一番道理：当年毛泽东同志率领秋收起义部队就是从这里上井冈山的。革命先辈们能打下江山，我们后人难道就不能绿化好荒山、建设好江山？
    他坚持开荒，每日天一亮就领着一家人上山，一干就是１０多个小时。两年后，廖吉生承包的２２２亩责任山全部栽上了杉树，而且都成活了。
    １９８４年冬的一天，廖吉生下山回家，路上他看着一块块茂密的杉林，心里盘算了起来：１０年后，一亩少说也有４０００多元收入。全乡还有多少荒山？如果都开垦出来造上杉林，收入该有多大！俗话说，靠山吃山。他萌发出一个大胆的想法：跨村跨乡承包荒山造林。
    他走村串户，与那些紧挨自己责任山的农户协商。乡邻们见他２００多亩杉林都活了，信得过他，个个乐意让他承包。区乡政府与林业部门也大力支持。不久，他与３个乡７个村的２１家有责任山的农户签订了承包绿化１４００亩荒山的合同。
    １９８４年冬天，廖吉生带领帮工们开始了大规模开荒造林。他就像一个指挥官，将１００多人分兵八路，每一路都砌好了炉灶、备好了炊具，还负责安排好饭菜。帮工们没有米，来他家里挑；没有菜，到他园里摘。几个月工夫，他家历年积存下来的粮食吃光了，还欠了一些账，廖吉生本人也比以前瘦了。这时，社会上有人称赞，也有的人讽刺：“把钱花在荒山上，这是做蠢事。”廖吉生心里透亮：造千多亩林，１５年后，最少也能获利２００万元，平均一年有十几万元。一个人不能鼠目寸光，而要看得远一些。
    如今，廖吉生承包的１６２２亩杉林，树木已经长到二三米高了，大的五六寸围。据林业部门介绍，１５年后，一亩不会少于７立方米。按１０００元一立方米计算，一亩收入７０００元，１６２２亩就是１１３５万元；扣除成本，可得纯利３４０万元。枫树岭上滚滚杉涛，似乎在奏着美妙动听的歌曲。
