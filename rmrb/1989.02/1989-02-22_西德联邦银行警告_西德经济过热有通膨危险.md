West German Federal Bank Warns of Inflation Risk Due to Economic Overheating

	Our correspondent Jiang Jian Guo reports from Bonn on February 21: The West German Federal Bank in its latest monthly economic report warned that the West German economy is currently overheating, posing a risk of price increases and inflation.

	The report states that the current rapid economic development is due to the growth in private consumption, investment, and exports. In the fourth quarter of 1988, the gross national product was 2.5% higher than the same period last year. Many sectors have reached nearly 88% of their maximum capacity, despite enterprises generally working overtime, the huge demand is still difficult to meet. The unemployment situation has significantly improved, and this situation is very similar to the overheating phase of the early 1970s.

	The West German Federal Bank's report states that prices are already showing an upward trend. In January this year, the price increase was significant, so it is necessary to strictly control the money supply. The report believes that price increases are due to both the increase in workers' real wages and the rise in international raw material prices.

    西德经济过热有通膨危险
    本报波恩２月２１日电  记者江建国报道：西德联邦银行在最新一次月度经济报告中警告说，西德经济目前过热，有物价上涨和通货膨胀的危险。
    这份报告说，目前经济发展速度较快原因是私人消费增长、投资和出口增长所致。１９８８年第４季度国民生产总值高于去年同期２．５％，许多领域开工率几乎达到８８％的极限程度，尽管企业普遍加班加点，巨大的需求仍难以满足，失业情况有显著好转，这种情况与７０年代初的过热阶段非常相似。
    西德联邦银行的报告说，物价已呈上涨趋势。今年１月物价增幅较大，因此有必要坚决控制货币供应量。这份报告认为，物价上涨一方面是因职工实际工资收入提高，另一方面也由于国际原材料价格上涨。
