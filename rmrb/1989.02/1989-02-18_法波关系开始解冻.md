Polish Prime Minister Rakowski, to restore and strengthen political and economic relations with France, visited Paris from February 14 to 16 for a three-day informal working visit. Due to the goodwill of both sides to improve relations, the visit achieved its intended purpose.

During the visit, Rakowski met with French President Mitterrand, Prime Minister Rocard, and Foreign Minister Dumont, and exchanged views on Poland's domestic situation, debt issues, and bilateral relations. On some major issues, both sides reached a basic consensus or narrowed their differences, paving the way for the restoration and development of political and diplomatic relations between the two countries, thus ending the long period of low ebb in their relations. President Mitterrand accepted the invitation to visit Warsaw in June this year, and Prime Minister Rocard also agreed to visit Poland at an appropriate time. In terms of economic and trade relations, the two countries signed an agreement on mutual protection and encouragement of investment, and also conducted preliminary negotiations on the issue of delaying the repayment of Poland's debt. Mitterrand has expressed France's "sympathy" to Rakowski, saying: "France will advocate for the extension of Poland's repayment period within the Paris Club and among the partners of the European Community."

France and Poland had maintained good relations before the 1980s, but after Poland declared martial law in December 1981, France froze all ties with Poland, and the two countries entered an "ice age," with exchanges between their leaders basically ceasing. In the past eight years, economic and trade relations between the two countries have also decreased year by year, with France's position in Poland's trade with Western countries dropping from second in 1981 to seventh in 1988.

Since Mitterrand was re-elected as the French President, in the context of the overall easing of international relations, especially East-West relations, France has begun to pursue a new policy towards Eastern Europe, willing to develop and strengthen relations with the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries. Over the past year, Mitterrand has successively visited the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and Bulgaria, and plans to visit Poland and East Germany this year. France's relations with the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries have begun to warm up. Mitterrand once pointed out, "We want to establish a new type of relationship between the two parts of Europe that have been divided by historical reasons. If Europe hopes to achieve some great goals in the early 21st century, we cannot continue to ignore each other." It is against this background that France-Poland relations have begun to thaw.

### 法波关系开始解冻

　　法波关系开始解冻
    新华社记者  茅瑞清
    波兰总理拉科夫斯基为恢复和加强同法国的政治和经济关系，于二月十四日至十六日到巴黎进行为期三天的非正式工作访问。由于双方都有改善关系的良好愿望，访问达到了预期目的。
    访问期间，拉科夫斯基会见了法国总统密特朗、总理罗卡尔、外交部长迪马，并就波兰国内形势、外债问题和双边关系等交换了意见。在一些重大问题上，双方取得了基本一致的看法或缩小了分歧，为恢复和发展两国的政治外交关系铺平了道路，从而结束了两国长期处于低潮的关系。密特朗总统应邀将于今年六月去华沙，罗卡尔总理也同意要在适当时间访问波兰。在经济贸易方面，两国签订了相互保护和鼓励投资的协定，还就延期归还波兰的债务问题进行了初步谈判。密特朗已向拉科夫斯基表示了法国的“同情”，他说：“法国将在巴黎俱乐部内部和欧洲共同体的伙伴中为延长波兰还债期限说情。”
    法国和波兰在八十年代以前曾保持着良好的关系，但从一九八一年十二月波兰在国内宣布戒严令以后，法国冻结了同波兰的各种联系，两国关系进入了“冰河时期”，两国领导人之间的往来基本断绝。在过去的八年里，两国的经济贸易也逐年减少，法国在波兰同西方国家的贸易中由一九八一年的第二位降到一九八八年的第七位。
    自从密特朗蝉联法国总统后，在整个国际形势、尤其是东西方关系趋向缓和的情况下，法国开始推行一条新的东欧政策，愿意发展和加强与苏联、东欧国家关系。去年以来，密特朗相继访问了苏联、捷克斯洛伐克和保加利亚等国，今年准备访问波兰和民主德国。法国与苏联、东欧国家的关系已开始转暖。密特朗曾指出，“我们要在由于历史原因而分割开的欧洲两部分之间建立一种新型的关系。如果在下世纪初欧洲希望实现某种伟大目标的话，我们就不能继续彼此视而不见了。”法波关系正是在这一背景下开始解冻的。
