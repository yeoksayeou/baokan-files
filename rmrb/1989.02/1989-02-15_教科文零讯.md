For over a decade, he has worked in a publishing house, designing covers and illustrations for the works of renowned figures such as Mao Dun, Ba Jin, Nie Huaqing, and other domestic and international celebrities.

    ●全国首届“丰收杯”中国画大奖赛获奖作品展２月１４日在中国美术馆开幕。杨成武等参加了开幕式。这次大奖赛是为了活跃农村文化生活、繁荣国画创作而举办的。共收到全国２６个省、市、自治区的近千幅作品，有１３０幅作品入选参展。展览期间将广泛听取观众意见，最后评出一、二、三等奖及佳作奖。
    ●戴卫人物画展２月１４日在北京中国美术馆开幕，美术界权威人士这样评价这一画展：富有现代意境和深刻哲理。四川中年画家戴卫涉猎过油画、版画、剪纸和雕塑等领域，在中国画上造诣尤高。但十几年来他在出版社甘为他人作嫁衣裳，为茅盾、巴金、聂华苓等海内外名家的著作设计过封面或插图，曹禺先生称他“是８０年代有远见、有才能的大装帧艺术家。”　　　（据新华社）
