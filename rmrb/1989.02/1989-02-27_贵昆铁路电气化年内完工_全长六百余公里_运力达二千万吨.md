The Guizhou-Kunming Railway Electrification to be Completed This Year
Full Length of 600+ Kilometers, Capacity to Reach 20 Million Tons

Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, February 26 - (Reporter Li Yuanda) The Guizhou-Kunming Railway electrification project, with all relevant parties prioritizing the overall interest and working together, has accelerated its construction progress. It is expected to be completed and operational by the end of this year.

The 630+ kilometer-long Guizhou-Kunming Railway electrification project is a key national construction project during the Seventh Five-Year Plan. The electrification of the Guiyang to Shuicheng section was completed in 1987. It is reported that after the full line electrification is opened, the transportation capacity of the Guizhou-Kunming Railway will increase from the original design of 690 million tons to over 1900 million tons.

To ensure the project proceeds smoothly, relevant departments have established specialized teams and designated personnel to coordinate and collaborate with neighboring departments. The Yunnan Provincial postal and power supply departments have organized meticulously and worked diligently to ensure that telephone line relocation and power supply projects are completed in advance, creating favorable conditions for the overall electrification project. The Guizhou-Kunming Railway electrification project requires nearly 680 acres of land in Kunming City. The Kunming Municipal Government has assigned personnel to establish a land acquisition office. Through arduous and detailed work, the land acquisition is now basically completed. The Kunming Railway Bureau has proactively cooperated with the construction, adjusting the vehicle operation schedule. The Yunnan Provincial Government and relevant departments have spared no effort to ensure the supply of materials for the project.

　　贵昆铁路电气化年内完工
    全长六百余公里　运力达二千万吨
    新华社昆明２月２６日电  （记者刘远达）贵昆铁路电气化建设各有关方面以全局利益为重，团结协作保重点，使这项工程加快了建设进度，预计今年可以全线建成通车。
    全长６３０多公里的贵昆铁路电气化工程是“七五”期间国家重点建设项目，其中贵阳至水城段电气化工程已于１９８７年建成。据介绍，待全线电气化开通后，贵昆铁路的运输能力将由原来设计的６９０万吨提高到１９００万吨以上。
    为了使工程同步进行，各有关部门都成立了专门班子，指定专人与友邻部门做好协调配合工作。云南省邮电、供电部门精心组织，精心施工，使电话线路拆迁、供应工程建设先行一步，为整个电气化工程建设创造了有利条件。贵昆铁路电气化工程在昆明市内需要征地近６８０亩。昆明市人民政府抽调干部，成立了征地办公室。经过艰苦细致的工作，目前征地工作已基本结束。昆明铁路分局主动配合施工，调整车辆运行图。云南省政府及有关部门千方百计保证工程建设用料。
