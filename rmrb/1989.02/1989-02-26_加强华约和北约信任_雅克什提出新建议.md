	Strengthening Trust Between the Warsaw Pact and NATO
	Yakub Proposes New Suggestions

	PRAGUE, Feb. 25 (Xinhua) — The General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, Gustav Husák, has proposed measures to further enhance trust and cooperation between the Warsaw Pact and NATO bordering countries.

	The Red Rights News today published his proposal, which includes: mutual notification of military exercises involving fewer troops than stipulated in the Stockholm Conference documents, inviting observers during exercises; expanding inspections of military activities in the trust belt areas; notifying the mobilization of reservists for military exercises and reducing the number of military exercises.

	Last February, Husák proposed the establishment of a trust, cooperation, and good-neighborly relations belt between the Warsaw Pact and NATO bordering countries. The new proposal is based on last year's suggestion. Husák also proposed the establishment of a unified environmental consultation mechanism in Central Europe, with the mechanism to be located in Prague.

　　加强华约和北约信任
    雅克什提出新建议
    新华社布拉格２月２５日电  捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央总书记雅克什提出一项进一步加强华约和北约交界国家之间的信任和合作的措施。
    《红色权利报》今天发表了他提出的这一建议，其内容包括：相互通报低于斯德哥尔摩会议文件规定人数的军事演习，演习时互邀观察员；
    在信任带地区扩大对军事活动的检查；
    通报应召预备役人员参加军事演习情况，并减少军事演习数量。
    雅克什去年２月曾提出了在华约和北约交界国家之间建立信任、合作和睦邻关系带的建议。新的建议是在去年建议基础上提出的。雅克什还提议中欧国家建立统一的环保磋商机构，并把该机构设在布拉格。
