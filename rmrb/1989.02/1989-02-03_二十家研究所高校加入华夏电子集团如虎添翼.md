Twenty research institutes and universities have joined the Huaxia Electronics Group, significantly enhancing the group's research and development capabilities. Several technological achievements have already been applied to production.

This group is a large, export-oriented enterprise centered around Xiamen's electronics industry. To continuously expand into international markets, the group has utilized the favorable conditions of the Xiamen Special Economic Zone. It has adopted various forms of cooperation with research institutes and universities, including joint research institutions, project collaborations, and the establishment of economic entities. Researchers from the 14th Research Institute of the Ministry of Machinery and Electronics in Nanjing have joined the core enterprise of the Huaxia Group, the Xiamen Overseas Chinese Electronics Company Limited, to establish the Huaxia Branch. The branch's personnel costs, office expenses, and research funds are covered by the company, while the branch directly develops new technologies and products for the company. In its first year, the branch has developed products such as digital television and home disco sound systems.

Currently, the Huaxia Group has 12 such research branches. For effective technological achievements, the Huaxia Group collaborates with research institutes to organize production. The farad-level super-large-capacity capacitor developed by the 49th Research Institute of the Ministry of Machinery and Electronics in Harbin is at the forefront of global technology. The institute is collaborating with the Huaxia Group to establish an export-oriented enterprise to produce these capacitors. Once in production, the annual output value can reach $100 million. The Huaxia Group has also established investment companies in collaboration with research institutes, using the institutes' technological achievements to attract foreign investment and quickly form large-scale production capabilities.

Over the past year, the collaboration between research institutes and the Huaxia Enterprise Group has brought 35 science and technology projects from inland regions and developed in Xiamen. Among these, 8 projects have been included in the National Science and Technology Commission's "Torch Program."

　　二十家研究所高校加入华夏电子集团如虎添翼
    本报讯  华夏电子集团吸收国内２０家科研单位和高等院校进入集团，双方密切合作，增强了企业的科研开发能力，一批技术成果已应用到生产中。
    这一集团是以厦门电子企业为主体组建的大型外向型企业集团。为了不断开拓国际市场，这个集团利用厦门特区的优惠条件，采取合办科研机构、项目合作、成立经济实体等形式，与科研单位和高等院校合作。机电部南京第１４研究所的科研人员进入华夏集团的骨干企业——厦门华侨电子企业有限公司，建立了华厦分所。分所人员的工资和办公、科研费用由公司负担，分所则直接为公司开发新技术、新产品。分所成立一年来，已开发出数字电视、家庭迪斯科音响等产品。
    目前，华夏集团已有这类科研分所１２个。对有效益的技术成果，华夏集团与科研单位联合组织投入生产。机电部哈尔滨第４９研究所研制的法拉级超大容量电容器，处于世界领先水平。该所与华夏集团合作筹建生产这种电容器的出口企业，投产后年产值可达１亿美元。华夏集团还与科研单位合资成立投资公司性质的经济实体，以科研单位的技术成果吸引外商投资办厂，尽快形成大批量生产能力。
    一年来，科研单位与华夏企业集团结合，从内地带来以及在厦门开发的科技项目已有３５项，其中列入国家科委“火炬”计划的项目有８个。（王如意）
