	On the "Literary Low Tide"

	Zeng Fan

	The signs of literature entering a low tide are evident in the recent discussions about literature losing its "shock effect." Although the literary world is seeing a surge of new stars and trends, with reports frequently claiming that certain authors have produced "milestone" works, the influence of literature is rarely felt beyond the "literary circle." Correspondingly, literary magazines and book publications have declined, readership has decreased, and bestsellers and popular magazines have quickly taken over the market. Many magazines, while complaining about the situation forcing them to "turn to vice," are also racking their brains to "support literature with supplementary content." For a time, it seemed as if literature, this small boat, had been swallowed by the commercial tide.

	I believe that literature has indeed lost its shock effect, and it may have entered a low tide, but there is no need to panic or sigh over this. The causes of the current state of literature are many, such as the impact of the commercial economy and the changes in the literary mission, function, and value brought about by the adjustment of social structures. However, people seem to have only noticed the current state of literature and the causes of this state, while ignoring the misunderstanding of literature by social psychology. Literature in our social life was once a dazzling image, once serving as a barometer of politics, affecting everyone's nerves. Now, due to changes in social order and life structure, literature has, unknowingly, returned to its proper place in the new cultural context, no longer serving as a shining gem on the political scepter. Thus, the psychological balance of many people has been disrupted, as if they have lost the lighthouse in the whirlpool of life. Obviously, the emergence of the literary crisis is directly related to the psychological imbalance of this group of people. Furthermore, literature itself is also undergoing fission in the new cultural context. It has just freed itself from political shackles and encountered the turbulent currents of the commercial economy, thus inevitably facing a dilemma of choice. The division and transformation of the writer's team, and the constant innovation of literary trends, all show that literature is passive and bewildered in the process of cultural adjustment. Moreover, the society in the early stages of commercial economy has always been anti-culture and anti-ideology in human history, so it is natural for people in the literary circle to feel a sense of loss for literature.

	From the sense of loss, I think that the literary crisis is actually an illusion, and literature entering a low tide is just a temporary phenomenon in the process of literary activities. Literature has always been a record of human spiritual growth, a guide to human self-awareness, self-overcoming, and self-motivation to survive. Therefore, like human creation history, literature is also a process. From this perspective, literature entering a low tide may not be a bad thing. This temporary phenomenon can make us think and understand: first, literature is not the "cause" we once understood. It does not represent or replace politics, economics, philosophy, or religion. It does not speak for some people or one person, nor does it serve a group or a cause. Literature comes from the need for human survival; it exists only for the permanent interests of all humanity. In terms of its nature, literature is a cultural process that transcends race, region, and time, coexisting with human reason and ideals. If a work attracts the attention of the entire society, even causing a frenzy, then what it conveys may not be the voice of literature, but political enthusiasm, scientific wisdom, or religious beliefs. Its impact is not necessarily a literary success, but may be the resonance of some spiritual "fashion" in the literary field. On the contrary, only when literature is integrated with human survival does it realize its value. For example, Qu Yuan and Shakespeare realized themselves through literature; for example, "Journey to the West" and "Faust" are the literary flowers of human life and wisdom. They did not write for themselves or for a specific group of people, so their voices can shake the hearts of all humanity; they do not represent any style or any ism, so they can enter the souls of all people as "literature." As Grosse said: "Almost every great work of art is not created to cater to popular taste but to resist it. Almost every great artist is not chosen by the public but is rejected by them." Therefore, secondly, literature, as a perpetual cultural process, will coexist with humans. It will neither die from the suppression of politics and religion nor wither from the erosion of money and wealth. Literature entering a low tide is because secular souls no longer need the comfort of literature, and secular spirits no longer need the image of literature. In other words, literature has become distant from the secular, fashion, and people. Whose fault is this? Of course, it is not the fault of "literature," because literature is a product of humans. Therefore, the current literary crisis is not a purely literary crisis, but a crisis of humans, a crisis of human survival, faith, and spirit, manifested in culture. The series of survival choices and cultural choices faced by the Chinese people will inevitably make literature fall into a momentary state of shock, that is, the intermediate state of process transformation. Once the cultural transformation process begins a new stage, literature will inevitably gain new momentum from human creative activities and find new language forms to understand the world and persuade secular audiences.

	Therefore, I regard today's literary "crisis" as just a temporary and normal cultural phenomenon. Moreover, in today's cultural transformation survival background, literature entering a low tide reveals the true situation of humans. When people do not know their goals and directions, how can they create literature full of confidence? Literature is a mirror of culture, a self-portrait of human spirit, and also an affirmation of human existence value. Therefore, what we need is not complaints and sighs about literature, but a reunderstanding and reshaping of ourselves. Literature in the low tide is waiting for the birth of a new cultural era and a new era of people, not others.

### 也谈“文学低谷”

　　也谈“文学低谷”
    曾凡
    文学进入低谷的表现，首先就是人们近来议论颇多的文学失去了“轰动效应”。虽然文坛新星新潮滚滚而来，前仆后继，甚至不断有报刊宣称某作家写出了“里程碑”式的巨著，但文学的辐射力实在是很少能穿透“文学界”这个圈子了。与此相应，文学期刊和书籍出版萎顿，读者锐减，“畅销书”和通俗报刊迅速占领市场，许多期刊则一面抱怨形势“逼良为娼”，一面挖空心思“以副养文”。一时间，文学这只小舟仿佛被商品经济的狂潮吞没了。
    我认为，文学失去轰动效应是真的，进入低谷也可能是真的，但由此而惊慌叹息则大可不必。造成文学现状的原因很多，比如商品经济的冲击，社会结构的调整带来的文学使命、文学功能、文学价值的变化等等都是。但人们似乎只注意了文学的现状和造成这种现状的原因，而忽略了社会心理对文学的误解。文学在我们的社会生活中曾经是一个灿烂夺目的形象，曾经作为政治的晴雨表而牵动着每一个人的神经。而现在，由于社会秩序的改变，生活结构的调整，文学在新的文化背景中，不知不觉地回到了它自身应有的位置上，不再充当政治权杖上闪闪发光的宝石了。于是，许多人的心理平衡被打乱了，似乎在生活的旋涡中失去了航标灯。显然，文学危机论的产生，与这部分人的心理失衡有直接的关系。其次，文学自身在新的文化背景中也发生着裂变。它刚刚脱开政治的枷锁，又遇到了商品经济的浊流，因此不可避免地遇到了选择的困境。作家队伍的分裂蜕变，文学潮流花样翻新，都显示出文学在文化调整过程中的被动和茫然。再加上商品经济初创时期的社会在人类历史上从来就是反文化、反意识形态的，因此，文学界的人们很自然地会产生文学的失落感。
    由失落感的产生，我想到文学的危机其实只是一个假象，文学进入低谷也只是文学活动过程中的一个暂时性现象。文学从来就是人类精神生长的记录，是人认识自己战胜自己并激励自己生存下去的灵魂的导师。因而，同人的创造历史一样，文学也是一个过程。从这个角度看，文学进入低谷可能不是一件坏事。这个暂时性的现象可以使我们思考并明白：第一，文学并不是我们曾经理解的那种“事业”，它既不代表也不能代替政治、经济、哲学、宗教，它既不为一些人或一个人而说话，也不为一个集团或一项事业而服务。文学来自人类生存的需要，它只为全体人类的永久利益而存在。就其本性而言，文学是超越种族、地域和时代的与人类知性和理想共生的文化过程。如果一部作品引起了全社会的关注甚至狂热，那么它所传达的可能不是文学的声音，而是政治热情、科学睿智或宗教信念，它的轰动也不一定是文学的成功，而很可能是某种精神的“时尚”在文学领域的回响。相反，只有在文学与人的生存融为一体时，它才是实现着自己的价值。比如屈原和莎士比亚就是以文学的方式实现自己的人；比如《西游记》和《浮士德》就是人类生命和智慧结出的文学之花。他们既不为自己也不为某一特定的人群而写作，所以他们的声音能够震撼全人类的心灵；它们既不代表某种风格也不代表某种主义，因而它们能够作为“文学”而进入一切人的灵魂。正像格罗塞所说：“差不多每一种伟大艺术的创作，都不是要投合而是要反抗流行的好尚。差不多每一个伟大的艺术家，都不被公众所推选反而被他们所摒弃。”因此，第二，文学作为一个生生不已的文化过程，将与人共存。它既不会因政治、宗教的扼杀而死亡，也不会因金钱、财富的侵蚀而萎顿。文学走入低谷，是因为世俗的心灵不再需要文学的抚慰，世俗的灵魂不再需要文学的形象。也就是说，文学与世俗与时尚与人疏远了。这是谁的责任呢？当然不是“文学”的责任，因为文学是人的产物。因此，当前的文学危机并不是单纯的文学危机，而是人的危机，是人的生存危机、信仰危机、精神危机的一种文化表现。中国人所面临的一系列生存选择、文化选择渗透到文学活动中，必然使文学处于瞬间的休克状态，也就是过程转化的中间状态。一旦文化转折过程开始新的阶段，文学也必然会从人的创造活动中获得新的动力，找到理解世界和说服世俗听众的新的语言形式。
    因此，我把今天的文学“危机”仅仅看作一个暂时性的正常的文化现象。而且，在今天这样一种文化转折的生存背景中，文学进入低谷才显示出人的真实处境。当人不知道自己的目标和方向时，他又怎么可能制造出充满信心的文学呢？文学是文化的镜子，是人类精神的自画像，也是人对自己存在价值的一种肯定。因此，我们需要的不是对文学的抱怨和叹息，而是对自身的重新理解和重新塑造。低谷中的文学，期待着新的文化时代和新时代的人的诞生，而不是其他。
