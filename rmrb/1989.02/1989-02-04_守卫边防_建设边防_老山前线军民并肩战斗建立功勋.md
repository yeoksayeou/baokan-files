Defending and Building the Border: Military and Civilians Together Create Merits on the Laoshan Frontline

YUNNAN, Feb. 3 (Xinhua) -- For a decade, the military and civilians on the Laoshan frontline have stood shoulder to shoulder in defending and building the border, contributing to the stability and prosperity of the southern frontier of our motherland.

Since the start of the self-defense counterattack against Vietnam, various levels of government in the Laoshan region have organized more than 20,000 militia members and civilian workers to support the troops in combat. They have been responsible for transporting supplies and rescuing the wounded. Several dozen militia members and civilian workers have sacrificed their lives in battle, and 1,700 units and individuals have been awarded military merits. The local area has established dozens of military supply stations and military-specialized supply production bases, ensuring a continuous supply of daily necessities for the frontline soldiers. Various relevant departments and units in the locality have also extensively carried out intellectual support activities, organizing hundreds of cultural remedial classes, teacher training classes, and cultural activity training classes for the frontline troops. They have helped more than 420 "cat-ear cave" individuals gain admission to military academies, and 5,600 soldiers have acquired 1 to 3 professional skills upon demobilization. Additionally, 1,270 people have become key figures in enriching the cultural life on the frontline.

While excellently completing the task of defending the border, the frontline troops have invested 180,000 labor days and more than 8,000 large mechanical vehicles to help the local area build 334 construction projects, including power stations, canals, high-voltage power lines, agricultural markets, and sports fields. The border soldiers have built roads and bridges, ensuring that each county along the border has 2 to 3 main roads, and even the most remote mountain villages have access to roads. The region's largest hydroelectric power station, the Xiahegou Power Station in Malipo County, faced construction delays due to terrain issues. Upon hearing the news, the frontline troops immediately dispatched more than 600 personnel and 50 large mechanical vehicles to provide support. The soldiers worked tirelessly for a month, moving tens of thousands of cubic meters of soil and rocks, contributing to the power station's early completion and power generation.

　　守卫边防　建设边防
　　老山前线军民并肩战斗建立功勋
    新华社昆明２月３日电  （通讯员张礼文、记者段建勋）老山前线军民１０年并肩守卫边防、建设边防，为祖国南疆的安定、繁荣做出了贡献。
    对越自卫还击作战以来，老山地区各级政府先后组织２万多名民兵、民工配属部队作战，担负运送物资、抢救伤员等任务，有数十名民兵、民工在战斗中英勇牺牲，１７００多个单位、个人荣立战功。当地还设立了数十个军供站、军专供生产基地，保证了对前线战士源源不断的生活供应。地方各有关部门和单位还广泛开展智力支前活动，为前线部队开办文化补习班、教员培训班和文化活动培训班上百期，帮助４２０多名“猫耳洞人”考上了军事院校，５６００名战士退伍时身怀１至３门专业技术，还有１２７０多人成为活跃前线文化生活的骨干。
    老山前线部队在出色完成保卫边防任务的同时，先后投入１８万个劳动日和８０００多台大型机械车辆，帮助地方建成电站、运河、高压输电线路、农贸市场和运动场等建设项目３３４项。边防战士修路筑桥，使边境各县都有了２至３条纵横公路干线，连大多数偏僻山乡村寨也都通了车。该地区装机容量最大的麻栗坡县小河沟水电站，建设中因地形关系影响施工进度。前线部队闻讯立即派出６００多官兵和５０台大型机械赶去支援。指战员连续苦干一个月搬走了数万立方米土石，为电站提前建成发电立下了功劳。
