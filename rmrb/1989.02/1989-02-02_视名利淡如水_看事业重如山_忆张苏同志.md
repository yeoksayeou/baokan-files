Indifferent to Fame and Profit, Dedicated to the Cause
— In Memory of Comrade Zhang Su

A loyal communist warrior, a proletarian revolutionary, and an outstanding leader on China's legal and political front, Comrade Zhang Su has completed his over 60-year revolutionary journey and passed away. The Party has lost an excellent member, and we have lost an old comrade-in-arms. We recall some fragments of his fighting career to express our sincere remembrance.

	(1)

After the Lugouqiao Incident in 1937, Comrade Zhang Su, who had been engaged in underground work for 10 years under the White Terror, followed Comrades Zhou Enlai, Nie Rongzhen, and others from Xi'an to the anti-Japanese front in North China. He worked with the Eighth Route Army in the border areas of Shanxi, Chahar, and Hebei to establish anti-Japanese governments, mobilize manpower, financial resources, and materials to support the frontline.

In the harsh environment, Zhang Su worked tirelessly, never considering his personal safety. With unyielding revolutionary will and selfless fighting spirit, he completed the arduous tasks assigned by the Party. He was a native of Yu County. In September 1937, Comrade Enlai asked him to go to Yu County with the troops to serve as the county magistrate. Before he arrived, the county was occupied by the Japanese invaders. After the Battle of Pingxingguan ended, he followed the Political Department of the 115th Division to enter Fuping County, serving as the county magistrate. Soon, Yang Chengwu's Independent Regiment liberated Yu County, and Zhang Su again served as the county magistrate. In November 1937, the Japanese invaders reoccupied Yu County, and the county government withdrew. He then served as the chairman of the administrative committee of Yu, Laiyuan, Lingqiu, Guangling, Hunyuan, Yangyuan, and Yi counties. Later, according to the needs of the struggle, he was reassigned as the county magistrate of Laiyuan County. In January 1938, he was elected as a member of the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region Administrative Committee and concurrently served as the director of the Industrial Department. In early March, the Japanese suddenly attacked Fuping County, and the Party, government, and military leadership of the border region withdrew to Wutai County. At that time, the counties in western Hebei reflected difficulties in communication, and the border region leadership decided to establish the Western Hebei Political Chief's Office, with Zhang Su concurrently serving as the chief. The office had only five or six staff members, and he personally handled all the work, taking on everything himself, until Western Hebei established three prefectural offices before he returned to work in the border region government.

Zhang Su had a democratic style, was approachable, and was good at uniting comrades and cadres to work together. In April 1938, when the border region government established the Party and League, he served as the secretary of the Party and League, working closely with members Song Shouwen and Hu Renkui, democratically discussing major issues without being arbitrary. He followed the instructions of the CPC Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region Committee, taking on the responsibility of liaising with the Party branch of the border region government as the secretary of the Party and League, achieving good coordination and cooperation between the administration and the Party branch. Through Comrade Hu Renkui, he did united front work with the "China Nationalist Party Jin-Cha-Ji United Office," uniting leftist Nationalists like Guo Feitian, and striking down rightist Nationalists like He Shengfu.

Zhang Su's anti-Japanese activities caused alarm and hatred among the Japanese invaders. On June 29, 1938, the commander of the Japanese garrison in Yu County issued a so-called "Exhortation to Zhang Xiqian" (Zhang Su was also known as Zhang Xiqian). The letter attempted to persuade Zhang Su to surrender while threatening to behead his entire family if he did not. Zhang Su was fearless, standing tall, and signed a refutation letter as "Zhang Xiqian, an anti-Japanese warrior of the Republic of China." The letter stated: "I am proud and unyielding, not swayed by external forces. Life and death are trivial, wealth and status are like floating clouds. I only seek to sacrifice myself for the country; nothing else matters. I have property, take it all; I have a family, kill them all. Your 'persuasive words' only make me laugh." This showed Zhang Su's brave spirit of fighting to the end.

The Japanese invaders' sweeps and blockades caused serious difficulties for our economic and financial work. From spring 1938 to spring 1943, Zhang Su was in charge of economic construction work. Based on the Party Central Committee and the border region Party organization's general policies for building the anti-Japanese base area, he proposed the guiding ideology for the border region's economic construction, especially emphasizing that "production is the decisive link in economic development, without production, there is no economy." He started from the actual situation of the border region and did a lot of solid organizational and leadership work. He arranged for each county to actively reclaim wasteland and repair damaged farmland, restoring a large amount of farmland destroyed by floods. He organized the border region's people to develop animal husbandry, advocating for one person to raise one chicken and five people to raise one pig, achieving satisfactory results. He highly valued science and technology, paying attention to the role of experts. With his support, agricultural experts Chen Fengtong, Zu Deying, and Li Tianchou established seven or eight farms, promoting crop hybridization and rational fertilization techniques. He organized and mobilized cadres and the masses to use local materials and adapt to local conditions, establishing many small factories and mines, effectively supporting the war effort. In February 1938, the Jinlong Paper Mill was built in Jinlong Cave, Fuping County. Later, paper mills were also established in Ping Mountain, Lingxiu, Tang County, Xingtang, and Ningjin County. The border region's people used straw and wheat stalks to make paper, alleviating the severe paper shortage. In May 1938, part of the workers from the Taiyuan Arsenal who withdrew to Wutai County were organized to establish the Border Region Manufacturing Plant. Using traditional methods to refine sulfur and extract saltpeter, and collecting scrap iron from the public, the urgent need for hand grenades for the army was gradually solved. In 1939, led by leather expert Li Biaoqian, the Lisheng Leather Factory was established, using rubber cups to make leather. Later, it was expanded to the Military Region's Logistics Department to meet the army's needs. He also led the Industrial Department of the Border Region Government to take over the coal mines in Fuping County's Tanhuichuang and Lingshan Coal Mine in Quyang County, playing an important role in solving the coal problem for iron smelting and other industries in western Hebei. As Comrade Nie Rongzhen pointed out: "Later, Comrade Zhang Su participated in the leadership of the border region government. He worked very seriously and practically, making contributions to consolidating the anti-Japanese political power of the border region."

Throughout his life, Zhang Su was frugal and selfless, incorruptible, and dedicated to his duties. For over 60 years, he worked diligently for the Party's cause. As early as 50 years ago, when Zhang Su was doing underground work in Beiping, he worked as a teacher. He handed over most of his monthly salary of 85 silver dollars to the Party organization as activity funds, keeping only a few dollars for himself, living a frugal life. After national liberation, he served as the vice chairman of the North China Administrative Committee, the chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and the vice procurator-general of the Supreme People's Procuratorate. As his position rose and his power increased, his self-discipline became even stricter. He set a rule for himself and his staff: "For private matters, reply that everyone has their own organization, and everything should be arranged and solved by the organization, not by me finding connections." Over the years, letters or visits requesting job placements, arranging for children to study, or transferring from other places were all rejected. He would rather "offend" relatives and friends than betray the Party. Zhang Su consistently opposed gift-giving, returning all gifts that were sent to him. The people of the old revolutionary base areas often came to visit him, sometimes bringing local specialties like sticky noodles, potatoes, and dried pumpkins. Zhang Su refused to accept them. If he had to accept them, he would have his secretary send money to the villagers and write a letter expressing thanks and explaining the reasons.

Although Zhang Su held a high position, he was self-disciplined and always considered the country's difficulties. During his underground work, a secret radio station of the North China Bureau of the CPC was hidden in the home of a relative, Mr. Zhang, who risked his life to protect the Party's radio station. After liberation, Zhang Su never forgot the old man's merits, often sending him tens or hundreds of yuan for support. Someone suggested reporting the situation to the Beijing Municipal Committee, so that the relevant departments could provide subsidies for the old man. Zhang Su only said one sentence: "Do not add to the state's burden." In 1985, when the procuratorial organs unified their uniforms, the leadership of the Supreme People's Procuratorate considered giving Zhang Su a procuratorial uniform because he had served in the procuratorial work for many years. Zhang Su said, "I am no longer doing procuratorial work, 'do not spend the state's money,'" insisting on not taking it.

Zhang Su spent his life rooted in and fighting among the people, always remembering the old revolutionary base areas that had made significant contributions and sacrifices for China's liberation. During the three years of difficulty, he returned to the old revolutionary base areas, standing on a platform, facing the crowd, and shedding tears: "Our work has not been done well, and we are sorry to the parents and fellow villagers of the base areas." In 1987, despite being diagnosed with cancer, Zhang Su, despite his advanced age and weakness, still visited Zhangjiakou and the Yanbei region's 2 cities and 7 counties to see the people there and understand their production, construction, and living conditions. Everywhere he went, he carefully inspected tree planting, crop improvement, and the construction of township enterprises, and offered suggestions.

"Indifferent to fame and profit, dedicated to the cause." This was the scroll that Zhang Su wrote for the retired cadres of the Supreme Procuratorate in 1985, and it was also a self-portrait of his life.

　　视名利淡如水　看事业重如山
    ——忆张苏同志
    刘澜涛　杨成武　宋劭文　王国权　王晓光
    忠诚的共产主义战士、无产阶级革命家、我国政法战线一位杰出领导人张苏同志，走完了他６０多年革命的道路，与世长辞。党失去了一位优秀党员，我们失去了一位老战友。现对他的战斗历程作些片断回忆，谨表挚诚地怀念之情。
    　　　　（一）
    １９３７年卢沟桥事变后，在白色恐怖下从事了１０年地下工作的张苏同志，随周恩来、聂荣臻等同志由西安赴华北抗日前线，随八路军在晋、察、冀交界地区开展建立抗日政权，动员人力、财力、物力支援前线的工作。
    在艰苦的环境中，张苏同志奋力工作，从不计较个人生死，以顽强的革命意志和忘我的战斗精神完成党交给的艰巨任务。他是蔚县人，１９３７年９月，恩来同志要他随部队去蔚县任县长。尚未赶到，该县即被日寇侵占。平型关战斗结束后，他随一一五师政治部进驻阜平县城，任县长。不久，杨成武独立团解放蔚县，张苏同志又任该县县长。１９３７年１１月，日寇再次侵占蔚县，县政府撤出，他担任了蔚县、涞源、灵丘、广灵、浑源、阳原、易县七县行政委员会主席。后来随着斗争形势的需要，又改任涞源县县长。１９３８年１月，他被选为晋察冀边区行政委员会委员兼实业处长。３月上旬，日寇突袭阜平县城，边区党、政、军领导机关撤到五台县境。当时，冀西各县反映联系不便，边区领导决定成立冀西政治主任公署，由张苏同志兼任主任。主任公署只有五、六个工作人员，他一切工作亲自动手，事必躬亲，直至冀西成立了３个专员公署，才回边区政府工作。
    张苏同志作风民主，平易近人，善于团结一道工作的同志和干部。１９３８年４月，边区政府成立党团，他任党团书记，同党团成员宋劭文、胡仁奎团结无间，对重大问题民主讨论，从不独断。他受中共晋察冀边区党委指示，以党团书记身份负责联系边区政府党总支的工作，使行政和党总支的工作取得很好的协调与配合。他通过胡仁奎同志做“中国国民党晋察冀联合办事处”的统一战线工作，团结了郭飞天等左派国民党人，打击了郝胜甫等国民党右派。
    张苏同志的抗日活动引起了日寇的恐慌和仇视。１９３８年６月２９日，日军蔚县警备司令官发出了所谓《劝告张希贤书》（张苏又名张希贤）。书中既对张苏劝降，又进行威胁，扬言如不投降定要抄斩全家。张苏同志毫无惧色，正气凛然，以“大中华民国抗日战士张希贤”署名写出批驳信。信中写道：“老夫傲骨天成，不为物移，度外生死，浮云富贵，但求为国捐躯，此外不暇计也。我有财产，任尔没收，我有妻室，任尔杀戮，阁下之‘苦口婆心’，但博老夫一笑耳。”表现了张苏同志坚决抗战到底的英勇气概。
    　　　　（二）
    日寇的扫荡和封锁，给我们经济、财政工作造成了严重困难。１９３８年春到１９４３年春，张苏同志主管经济建设工作。他根据党中央和边区党组织关于建立边区抗日根据地的总方针、总政策，提出了边区经济建设的指导思想，特别强调“生产是经济发展的决定的一环，离开了生产，就谈不到经济”。他从边区的实际情况出发，做了许多扎扎实实的组织领导工作。他布置各县积极垦荒修滩，修复了被大水冲垮的大量耕地。他组织边区人民发展饲养业，提出一人一鸡、五人一猪的号召，取得了可喜成绩。他非常重视科学技术，注意发挥专家的作用。在他的支持下，陈凤桐、祖德铭、李天俦等农业专家办起了七八处农场，推广作物杂交、合理施肥等技术。他组织动员干部群众，就地取材，因地制宜，办了许多小型厂矿，有力地支援了抗战。１９３８年２月，在阜平县金龙洞建起了金龙造纸厂。之后在平山、灵寿、唐县、行唐和宁晋县也办了造纸厂。边区人民利用稻草、麦秸制造土纸，使严重的纸荒得到缓解。１９３８年５月，组织从太原兵工厂撤到五台县的部分职工，成立了边区制造所。用土法炼磺、熬硝，从民间收集废铁，逐步解决了当时军队急需的手榴弹供应问题。１９３９年，以制革专家李彪辰为首，兴办了力生制革厂，用橡碗子制革。后来转到军区后勤部扩大生产，满足了军队的需要。他还领导边区政府实业处接办了阜平县炭灰铺煤矿、曲阳县灵山煤矿，对解决当时冀西炼铁等工业用煤起了重要作用。正如聂荣臻同志指出的：“张苏同志后来参加了边区政府的领导工作，他工作很认真，很踏实。为巩固边区抗日政权做出了贡献。”
    　　　　（三）
    张苏同志一生艰苦朴素，不谋私利，廉洁奉公，身体力行，６０余年如一日，勤勤恳恳为党的事业奉献自己。早在５０年前，张苏同志在北平做地下工作，以教师为公开职业。他把每月８５块银元薪水的绝大部分交给党组织，作为活动经费，自己只留几元钱，过着清苦的日子。全国解放后，他担任过华北行政委员会副主席、全国人大法案委员会主任委员、最高人民检察院副检察长等职。地位高了，权力大了，对自己的要求更加严格。他为自己和身边的工作人员制订了一条规定：凡为私事来者，一律回答“各有各的组织，一切由组织安排解决，不能由我找关系。”多年来，来信或上门要求安排工作，联系子女上学，欲从外地调京者，统统被拒之门外。他宁可“得罪”亲朋，决不负罪于党。张苏同志一贯反对送礼，送上门来的都一律退回。老区的人民出于对他的敬意，常来看望他，有时顺便带上一点家乡的土产：粘面、土豆、南瓜干之类，张苏同志一概拒收。有时不得已收下了，也要让秘书给乡亲们寄钱，并写信表示感谢，讲清道理。
    张苏同志虽然身居高位，但克己奉公，时时处处体谅国家的困难。他从事地下工作时，中共北方局的一部秘密电台经他手隐藏在一位世交张老先生家，老先生冒着生命危险保护了党的电台。解放后，张苏念念不忘老人的功劳，时常几十元或数百元地周济他。有人建议将情况反映给北京市委，由有关部门给这位老先生补助。张苏同志只说了一句话：“不要增加国家的负担。”１９８５年检察机关统一着装，最高人民检察院的领导考虑到张苏同志担任检察院的领导工作多年，准备给他也配发检察服。张苏同志说，不做检察工作了，“不要多花国家的钱”，坚持没有要。
    张苏同志一生扎根和战斗于人民群众之中，时刻挂记着曾为中国的解放事业做出了重大贡献和牺牲的老区人民。三年困难时期他回到老区，站在土台子上，面对群众流着眼泪说：我们的工作没做好，对不住根据地的父老乡亲。１９８７年，已身患癌症的张苏同志，不顾年高体弱，还到张家口、雁北地区的２市７县，看望那里的人民，了解那里的生产建设、生活情况。每到一地，他都认真察看植树造林、农作物改良和乡镇企业的建设等情况，并提出意见。
    “视名利淡如水，看事业重如山”。这是张苏同志１９８５年为高检院离退休干部书写的条幅，也正是他一生的自我写照。
