The spring breeze quickly passes through the Jade Gate Pass, and new tides fill the Tian Shan Mountains. Nearly 100 private science and technology institutions have emerged in Xinjiang.

XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, URUMQI, February 1 - (Reporter Liu Guangniu) Following the example of Liu Bocang, an engineer from the Xinjiang Light Industry Bureau, who took a leave of absence to start the Urban and Rural Engineering Technology Service Center last year, a batch of privately run research institutions have been established. As of now, Xinjiang has nearly 100 private science and technology development entities. The number of people engaged in private science and technology development in the Urumqi area alone has reached over 1,200.

These new economic entities, which do not cost the state a single penny to establish, are market-oriented and technology-based, integrating technology with industry, agriculture, and commerce. They have achieved significant economic and social benefits. In its first year, the Xinjiang Urban and Rural Engineering Technology Service Center expanded from a single engineering design service to food research and new product development, equipment installation, comprehensive engineering contracting, talent training, and factory operation. It has also established an economic and technological joint venture with Hainan Province. In 1988, it achieved a production value of 70 million yuan, realized a profit of 9 million yuan, paid 2.5 million yuan in taxes, and had an average annual production value per person of 100,000 yuan. The Xinjiang Township Road Technology Design Service Center, established by retired senior engineer Shen Yongxiang and more than 60 retired scientific and technological personnel, designed 7 roads totaling over 370 kilometers in 1988. According to national regulations, they should have collected over 300 million yuan in fees, but they actually only collected 4.6 million yuan and paid 190,000 yuan in taxes. This saved the state a significant amount of engineering costs.

　　春风早度玉门关　年来新潮满天山
    新疆涌现近百家民办科技机构
    新华社乌鲁木齐２月１日电  （记者刘光牛）继一年前，新疆维吾尔自治区轻工厅工程师刘伯堂停薪留职，创办城乡工程技术事务所之后，一批民办科研机构相继建立。截至目前，新疆已有民办科技开发实体近百家。仅乌鲁木齐地区民办科技开发实体的从业人员已达１２００多人。
    这些不花国家一分钱创办的新型经济实体以市场为导向，以技术为依托，实行技工贸、技农贸一体化经营，经济效益和社会效益都很显著。新疆城乡工程技术事务所成立一年来，已从单一的工程设计业务，扩展到食品研究及其新产品开发、设备安装、工程总承包、人才培训、开办工厂等方面，并与海南省建立经济技术联营关系。１９８８年完成产值７００万元，实现利润９０万元，上缴税金２５万元，人均年产值达１０万元。由退休高级工程师沈永祥和６０余名离、退休科技人员为主体创办的新疆乡镇道路技术设计事务所，１９８８年共勘测、设计公路７条，总长３７０多公里，按国家规定应收费３００多万元，但他们实际只收了４６万元，纳税１．９万元。为国家节约了大量工程造价。
