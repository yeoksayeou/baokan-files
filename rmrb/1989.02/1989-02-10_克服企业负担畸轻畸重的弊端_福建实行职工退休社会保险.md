Some enterprises have to bear the retirement costs of one or even more retired workers for each in-service worker, making it difficult for them to compete on equal terms with enterprises that have lighter burdens. This situation has changed in Fujian. Starting from this year, the province has fully implemented a mandatory retirement pension social insurance system for state-owned enterprises, pooling funds to eliminate the disadvantages of uneven burdens caused by enterprises bearing their own retirement costs.

Fujian's shift from enterprise-based insurance to social insurance, and the implementation of a pooled retirement pension system, began in 1985 with county-level and above state-owned enterprises. In 1986, the province established a social insurance system for contract workers and employees of "three types of enterprises" (foreign-funded, jointly-funded, and privately-funded enterprises). Provincial, municipal, and county-level social insurance management agencies were established to unify the management of social insurance work. By the end of last year, more than 10,000 units in the province had implemented social insurance, covering 700,000 employees and securing the retirement of 120,000 retired workers. This reform has played an active role in balancing the burdens between regions and enterprises. Enterprises that were previously burdened with heavy retirement costs have been relieved, increasing their vitality and creating conditions for the deepening of economic reforms.

According to the principles of "contributions based on expenditures, with a slight surplus" and "accumulation and storage," Fujian unifies the collection, management, and use of retirement pension funds. Commercial and grain trading enterprises contribute 25% of their total wages, while industrial and other enterprises contribute 17% of their total wages. Contract workers, state-owned and collective mixed workers, and temporary workers contribute 2% of their individual total wages.

After enterprises contribute the retirement pension funds to the social labor insurance company as required, the company pays the retirement benefits to the enterprises according to the listed items and standards. Retired workers continue to receive their retirement benefits from their original enterprises. For contract workers and state-owned and collective "mixed workers," the pension is calculated based on the years and amount of retirement pension funds contributed by the enterprise and the worker. For temporary workers, a storage and accumulation-style retirement pension insurance system is implemented.

The Fujian Provincial Labor Bureau explained that the social insurance business managed by the social labor insurance company is different from the insurance business operated by the financial sector. It does not aim to make a profit. Because the social insurance fund comes from the accumulation of laborers, it is part of the redistribution of national income. They pay a small amount of insurance premiums and can enjoy the guaranteed benefits stipulated by the state.

### 克服企业负担畸轻畸重的弊端　福建实行职工退休社会保险

　　克服企业负担畸轻畸重的弊端
　　福建实行职工退休社会保险
    本报福州电  记者张铭清报道：有些企业一个在职职工要负担一个甚至更多的退休职工费用，因而无法在平等条件下与负担较轻的企业开展竞争的状况，在福建已经改变。这个省从今年１月起全面实行全民所有制企业强制性退休养老社会保险，进行费用统筹，消除了由企业自行负担职工退休费用造成的畸轻畸重的弊端。
    福建改企业保险为社会保险，实行退休费用社会统筹是从１９８５年在县以上全民所有制企业开始的。１９８６年又对全省劳动合同制工人、“三资企业”职工建立了社会保险制度，省、地、市、县成立了社会保险专职管理机构，统一管理社会保险工作。到去年底，全省已实行社会保险的单位达１万多个，职工７０多万人，保障离退休职工１２万人。这一改革，对均衡地区间、企业间的负担发挥了积极的社会调剂作用。那些原来背着沉重的退休费用负担的企业得到解脱后，增加了活力，为经济体制的深入改革创造了条件。
    按“以支定筹，略有节余”和“储存积累”的原则，福建对退休养老保险基金统一筹集、管理和使用。商业、粮食经营性企业按工资总额的２５％缴纳，工交和其他企业按工资总额的１７％缴纳，劳动合同制工人、全民带集体混岗职工和临时工个人按本人工资总额的２％缴纳。
    企业按规定向社会劳动保险公司缴纳退休费用统筹基金后，社会劳动保险公司对固定职工按列入的统筹项目和标准向企业投付退休费用，退休职工仍向原企业领取退休费，对劳动合同制职工和全民带集体的“混岗职工”，按企业和职工缴纳退休养老基金的年限和金额计发养老金。对临时工实行储存积累式的退休养老保险制度。
    福建省劳动局解释说，社会劳动保险公司管理的社会保险事业与金融业开办的保险性质不同，它不以盈利为目的。因为社会保险基金来自劳动者的积累，属国民收入再分配，他们缴纳少量保险金，就可获得享受国家规定的保障待遇的权利。
