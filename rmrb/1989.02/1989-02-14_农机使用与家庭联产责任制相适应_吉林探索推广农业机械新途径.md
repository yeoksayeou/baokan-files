    Harmonizing Agricultural Machinery Use with the Household Contract Responsibility System: Jilin Explores New Paths for Promoting Agricultural Machinery

    According to a report in the February 10 issue of the Jilin Daily, the high initial investment in equipment and the low purchasing power of farmers—these are the two major contradictions that have long plagued the development of agricultural machinery in Jilin since the implementation of the household contract responsibility system. Can these two fundamental issues be resolved? How can they be resolved? After several years of exploration and practice, a solution has finally been found.

    At the beginning of the reform, when land was distributed to individual households, agricultural machinery was neglected, and the area of mechanized plowing in the province decreased by 40%. With the awakening of commercial economic awareness and the development of production, farmers have gained new insights into the use of agricultural machinery. However, the high initial investment required for agricultural machinery, especially large-scale machinery, makes it difficult for individual households to afford. To address these issues, the agricultural machinery department first focused on miniaturization of equipment. When promoting the technology of water rice greenhouse seedling cultivation and transplanting, they recommended the short greenhouse, small steam germination room, and hand-cranked seed drill developed by Huadian City, along with the manual transplanter produced in Yanbian. This reduced the initial investment per mu from 220 yuan to around 60 yuan.

    In terms of agricultural machinery use, they gradually explored a set of methods that adapt to the household contract responsibility system and promoted them. In plowing operations, they implemented a rotation system, where towns or villages use agricultural machinery jointly, plan plowing in the long term, and share the costs. In sowing operations, they implemented a unified sowing and separate management system, where mechanical sowing is used uniformly as the basis, and other field operations are managed by individual households. By the end of 1988, 45% of towns in the province had implemented the rotation system, and 2,700 villages had implemented the unified sowing and separate management system, accounting for 26% of the total number of villages in the province. By the end of 1988, the province's agricultural tractor ownership reached 203,000 units, of which 92.9% were individually operated by farmers. The total agricultural machinery power and the number of matched agricultural machinery tools both exceeded historical highs. The area of mechanized plowing and mechanized sowing also approached historical highs, reaching 23.63 million mu and 16.32 million mu, respectively. The area of mechanized transplanting reached 2.26 million mu, leading the nation.

    吉林探索推广农业机械新途径
    本报讯  据２月１０日出版的吉林日报报道：设备一次性投资大与农民购买力低，大设备与小生产规模——这是实行家庭联产承包责任制后，一直困扰吉林农机发展的两大矛盾。这两个实质性的问题能不能解决？怎么解决？经过几年的摸索实践，终于找到了途径。
    改革之初，分田到户，农机备受冷落，全省机耕地面积骤减４０％。随着商品经济意识的觉醒和生产的发展，广大农民对农机的使用又有了新认识。然而，农机，特别是大型农机具，一次性投资之大，农民一家一户是很难负担的。针对这些问题，农机部门首先在设备小型化上下功夫。在推广水稻大棚盘育苗机插秧技术时，他们推荐桦甸市研制出的短大棚、小蒸气出芽室、手摇播种机，配备延边产手动插秧机，使一次性亩投资由２２０元降到６０元左右。
    在农机使用上，他们逐步摸索出一套与家庭联产承包责任制相适应的方法，并加以推广。在耕地作业上实行轮翻制，即以乡（镇）或村为单位，对耕地实行长期规划，联合使用农机，统一耕翻，费用均摊。在播种作业上实行统种分管制，即以联合使用机械统一播种为基础，其它田间作业实行分户管理。到１９８８年底，全省已有４５％的乡（镇）实行了轮翻制，实行统种分管的村已达２７００个，占全省村总数的２６％，到１９８８年底，全省农用拖拉机保有量达到２０．３万台，其中农民个体经营占９２．９％。农机总动力、配套农机具数量都超过了历史最高水平，机耕地、机播种面积也接近历史最高水平，分别达到２３６３万亩和１６３２万亩，机插秧面积达到２２６万亩，居全国领先地位。
