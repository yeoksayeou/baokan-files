The Old Blacksmith

Lips tightly pressed in silence, cold and distant,
Only with arms, a thousand and one times,
In large arcs, they turn,
A unique form of expression...
Emotions entrusted to the white-hot furnace,
The hammer speaks with a clang,
One weighty tome after another,
Absolutely forbidding any emptiness,
Every word, a force of gravity,
A lifetime of thoughts,
The hammer, after a high-level summary,
Translated into a pickaxe for pioneering,
Or a gleaming plow...

The Cotton-Picker

When the cotton-picker comes, that season follows,
On the wings of geese, ceaselessly flapping,
Issuing a notice or declaration,
All in cold tones,
When the cotton-picker comes, that season follows,
Rather than showing a season,
It's more like accepting a responsibility, a challenge,
The great bow, like a crescent moon, held in the arms,
Thudding out heavy sounds,
The great bow, like a pipa, held in the arms,
Playing melodious notes,
Soon the winter month is picked soft and fluffy,
The biting wind picked tame as a deer,
He just keeps his head down, picking and picking,
Seriously renovating the old,
Embracing the cold with his whole being,
Revealing the essence of the sun.

　　老铁匠（外一首）
    任志玺
    嘴角紧抿着沉默，冷漠
    只用双臂一千一万次
    大弧度地旋转
    做一种特殊的表达方式……
    感情交给白炽的炉火了
    锤头在铿锵发言
    一部又一部有分量的长篇
    只是绝禁一切空洞
    每一句，都是重力加速度
    一辈子的心事
    锤头高度概括之后
    翻译成一把拓荒的镐
    或是一架闪光的犁……
    　　　　弹花人
    弹花人一来那个季节就尾随而
    　至了
    那个季节在雁翅上不停地煽动
    　着
    在发布一则预告或宣言
    全部都是冷色调的
    弹花人一来那个季节就尾随而
    　至了
    与其说他来显示一个季节
    不如说是接受一种责任，一种
    　挑战
    大弓弯月似地抱在怀里
    咚咚地弹那沉重的声音
    大弓琵琶似地抱在怀里
    悠扬地弹那悦耳的音符
    一会儿就将腊月弹得蓬松了
    凛冽的风弹得鹿儿般的温驯
    他只顾埋头弹呀弹
    认真地破旧翻新
    全身心拥抱寒冷
    在于揭示阳光的真谛
