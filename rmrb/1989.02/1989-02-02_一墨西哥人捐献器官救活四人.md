A Mexican donates organs to save four lives

New China News Agency, Mexico City, January 31st: Mexican Health Minister Jesus Kumate announced on the 31st that due to a Mexican donating his organs, four critically ill patients were saved.

He said that transplanting multiple organs from one person is unprecedented in Mexican history. From a medical perspective, this unprecedented organ transplant operation was highly coordinated.

The Mexican who voluntarily donated multiple organs is a doctor from the Mexican Social Security Institute. He was diagnosed with a brain tumor and had been declared "clinically dead." His heart, kidneys, lungs, and liver were transplanted into five patients in four different hospitals. Only one patient who received a liver transplant did not survive.

　　一墨西哥人捐献器官救活四人
    新华社墨西哥城１月３１日电  墨西哥卫生部长赫苏斯·库马特３１日宣布，由于一名墨西哥人捐献了自己的器官，从而救活了４名生命垂危的病人。
    他说，移植一个人体的几个器官在墨西哥历史上尚属第一次。从医疗技术观点看，这次史无前例的移植器官的手术是十分协调的。
    这位志愿捐献多个器官的墨西哥人是墨社会保险协会的医生。他身患脑瘤，已被宣判为“临床死亡”。他的心脏、肾、肺和肝器官分别移植到分住在４家医院的５名患者身上，仅一名接受肝器官移植的病人未能活下来。
