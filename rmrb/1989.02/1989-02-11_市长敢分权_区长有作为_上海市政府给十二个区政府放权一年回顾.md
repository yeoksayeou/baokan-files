Mayor Dares to Delegate Authority, District Leaders Take Initiative
— A Review of Shanghai Municipal Government Delegating Authority to 12 District Governments for One Year

By Zhang Shihong, People's Daily Reporter

1988 was the first year Shanghai implemented the fiscal contract system. The municipal government divided the fiscal contract among the districts, which led to a significant increase in the fiscal revenue of the 12 districts last year. Previously, the city supported the districts, but now the districts also support the city. Last year, they contributed 40 million yuan to the city's expenditures.

In a city of 12 million people, there are countless tasks. Is it feasible for the city to issue orders for everything? Mayor Zhu Rongji sees it this way: "I believe that such a large entity cannot be managed solely by the city. We need to let the 12 district leaders all act as 'little mayors,' and let them do the work. They will definitely do it better than we do!"

Does this view align with reality? Let's look at some figures:

Last year, the fiscal revenue of the 12 districts was 2.791 billion yuan, an increase of 10.4% over the previous year, which is a historic high. The collective industrial output value managed by the districts reached 3.16 billion yuan, an increase of 12% over the previous year. The commercial sector was exceptionally prosperous, with retail sales reaching approximately 20 billion yuan. Previously, foreign trade rights were centralized in the city, but last year the districts also gained foreign trade rights, leading to a 28.9% increase in foreign exchange earnings. The utilization of foreign capital projects was 2.8 times higher than the historical total. Urban construction added over 300,000 square meters of new space, and expanded green areas by 130,000 square meters. These are all achievements made by the districts through their comprehensive functions.

"What did you feel most deeply in this past year?" I asked Huangpu District Mayor Chen Liangyu this question.

"From the mindset to the sense of responsibility, there has been a qualitative change," he replied succinctly: "In the past, the district government was nominally a level of government, but it had no real power. Even building a toilet required approval from above. Now, within our scope of responsibility, we have the power to approve, manage, and handle personnel matters. This district mayor feels a bit more like a district mayor, with a stiffer spine, and we have something to strive for!"

Yangpu District has many municipal state-owned enterprises, and the district mainly manages street factories. Their strategy is to serve large-scale industries. The district formulated various preferential policies, and the mayor led the financial, tax, price, and industrial and commercial departments to attract many of their cooperative projects to the district's street factories. Additionally, they supported municipal enterprises in optimizing their labor force, establishing many tertiary industries, and increasing commercial outlets by over 400, which expanded the fiscal revenue base, ultimately exceeding the fiscal revenue target.

Nanshi District relies on "City God Temple" for income, accelerating the development and construction of the Yu Garden tourist area, which drove the development of the entire district's economy.

Jing'an District has the smallest land area but has many overseas Chinese. They focused on utilizing foreign capital, resulting in being at the forefront among the districts.

What impact does comprehensive delegation of authority have on municipal institutions? It should be said that after breaking the old vertical closed system, it is a great liberation for municipal institutions. The leader of the Municipal Construction Commission told the reporter, "In the past few years, before the Spring Festival, there were always urgent issues, such as garbage piles here and collapsed houses and water outages there, all of which came to us, and we were busy dealing with them. This Spring Festival, the city no longer received urgent calls, all of which were resolved by the districts."

There are two things that have greatly inspired the city's cadres:

First, the implementation of the "Vegetable Basket" project. The city is in charge, and each district is also in charge. Currently, the Shanghai market has abundant goods, and the supply of vegetables and sideline products is sufficient, with no shortage of resources and smooth channels. The districts have played a significant role. For example, Changning District has seriously managed agricultural markets and small commodity markets, promoting the commercial economy of the entire district and greatly reducing the pressure on the city.

Second, each district raises funds for education. Last year, 40% of the fiscal revenue of each district was used for the construction of primary and secondary schools. This year is the year of education, and each district will invest a large amount of fiscal revenue in education. Xuhui District spent 10 million yuan on education last year, and the laboratories of over 40 middle schools reached national standards, which was unimaginable under the old "unified collection and distribution" policy.

Will delegation of authority lead to more chaos? There are also such negative comments. In fact, delegation of authority is precisely the way to manage chaos, the key is to clarify responsibilities. Whoever is given the authority should bear the responsibility and take the risk. The fear is not delegation of authority, but that everyone is responsible and no one is responsible. After delegation of authority, the municipal institutions should first focus on major overall issues, conduct macro-coordination, and study major problems. For example, the Municipal Sanitation Bureau, after being freed from heavy administrative tasks, is currently focusing on studying the disposal of urban garbage, updating sanitation equipment, and the scientific development of sanitation. This time, Shanghai's delegation of authority is quite thorough, with 10 aspects and 122 items of authority. Each district has formulated implementation rules and work regulations for how to use each item of authority, with the sole purpose of self-discipline and preventing chaos. Before the Spring Festival, the mayor convened a meeting with district committee secretaries and mayors to celebrate their achievements. Although there was only a cup of plain tea, the atmosphere was harmonious, fully affirming the achievements of delegation of authority. This year, delegation of authority will be further advanced, and anything that was not thoroughly delegated last year will be further delegated. The mayor's attitude is very clear: as long as it complies with the laws and regulations passed by the Municipal People's Congress, the documents and instructions issued by the Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Government, the districts have the right to make their own decisions. If there are different opinions from relevant municipal departments, the districts should listen humbly, but the decision-making power lies with the districts.

Now that the city has delegated authority to the districts, the question is whether the district mayors dare to have bolder ideas for the overall work of the district and whether they have the courage and vision.

　　市长敢分权　区长有作为    
    ——上海市政府给十二个区政府放权一年回顾
    本报记者  章世鸿
    １９８８年是上海实行财政承包第一年，市府把财政承包分割给各区，促使去年１２个区财政收入大幅度上升。过去是市支持区，现在则各区也支持市，去年承担了市里开支４０００万元。
    一个１２００万人的大城市，工作千头万绪，什么事都由市里发号施令，行不行？市长朱熔基是这样看的：“我认为，这样一个大摊子，光靠市里管是管不好的，要让１２个区长都当‘小市长’，让他们来干，肯定比我们干得好！”
    这番话是否符合实际？让我们先看几个数字：
    去年１２个区财政收入２７．９１亿元，比前年增长１０．４％，这个数字是超历史的。各区管的集体工业产值达３１．６亿元，比前年增长１２％。各区商业空前繁荣，零售额达２００亿元左右。过去外贸权集中在市里，去年区里也有了外贸权，创汇猛增２８．９％。利用外资项目比历史总和高２．８倍。城市建设新辟３０多万平方米，扩建绿化地段１３万平方米。这都是区发挥综合功能取得的成绩。
    “你在这一年中感受最深的是什么？”我向黄浦区区长陈良宇提出这个问题。
    “从思想观念到工作责任性都起了质的变化。”他回答得很干脆：“过去，区政府名为一级政权，实际上没有什么权。连盖一个厕所也要上面批。现在，在职责范围内，我们有了批审权、管理权、人事权，我这个区长有些像区长了，腰杆硬些了，我们有了奔头！”
    杨浦区市属国营企业特别多，区里主要管街道工厂，他们的“点子”是为大工业服务。区里制定各项优惠政策，区长带领财税、物价、工商部门干部到市属企业中去，把他们的许多协作项目吸引到本区街道工厂来；其次是支持市属企业优化劳动组合，大办第三产业，增加商业网点４００多个，扩大了财政税源，终于超额完成了财政收入。
    南市区靠“城隍庙”吃饭，加快豫园旅游区的开发建设，带动了全区经济的发展。
    静安区地盘最小，但侨胞多，他们把文章做在利用外资上，结果在各区名列前茅。
    全面放权对市级机构产生什么影响呢？应该说，把老的纵向封闭体制打破后，对市级机构来说，是一次很大的解放。市基本建设委员会领导人对记者说，前几年，每到春节前夕，下面纷纷告急，这里垃圾堆积，那里坍房断水，都找到上面来，我们穷于应付。今年春节前夕，市里不再收到告急电话，全由区里解决了。
    有两件事对市里干部启发很大：
    一是“菜篮子”工程的实施，市里抓，各区也都在抓。目前，上海市场商品丰富，蔬菜、副食品供应充实，资源不缺，渠道畅通，区里发挥了很大的能动性。如长宁区认真抓好农贸市场和小商品市场，推动了全区的商业经济，大大减轻了对市里的压力。
    二是各区自筹教育经费。去年各区的财政收入中４０％用于中小学建设上。今年是教育年，各区更将大量财政发展教育。徐汇区去年在教育上花了１０００万元，４０多个中学的实验室都达到国家标准，这是过去那种“统收统支”政策难以想象的。
    放权是否会越放越乱？也不是没有这种消极的言论。其实，放权恰巧是治乱之道，关键在于分清职责。权交给谁，谁就该挑担子，承担风险。怕的不是放权，怕的是谁都负责而谁也不负责。放权以后，市级机构首先是要抓全局性的大事，进行宏观的协调，研究大问题。比如说，市环卫局，自从摆脱繁重的事务后，他们目前主要精力是研究全市垃圾出路问题、环卫设备更新问题、环卫科学发展问题。上海这次放权比较彻底，共有１０个方面１２２条权，对如何用好每一条权，各区都制定实施细则和工作条例，目的无非是自我约束，防止乱来。春节前夕，市长召集区委书记、区长开了一个庆功会，虽然只有清茶一杯，但气氛融洽，充分肯定放权的成绩。今年仍将进一步放权，凡去年放得不够彻底的今年进一步放。市长的态度非常明确：只要符合市人大通过的法规、规章，符合市委、市府下达的文件和指示，区里有权自己作出决定。如果市有关部门有不同意见，各区应该虚心听取，但决定权在区里。
    市里对区里放权了，现在的问题是区长对全区工作敢不敢有更大胆的设想，有没有这种气魄和胆略。
