The issue is not whether public ownership is desirable, but rather that the public ownership economy lacks a corresponding economic interest mechanism.

Economic system reform ultimately involves a comprehensive adjustment and redistribution of economic interests. Any economic reform measure, when introduced, will directly or indirectly affect the economic interests of different legal entities and individuals. It will either increase the economic interests of one party or decrease those of another. Due to various constraints of economic interests, certain reform measures often face difficulties in being smoothly implemented or have to make compromises or concessions.

Economic interests are the driving force behind social economic development. In economic life, all economic activities are subject to human behavior, and human behavior is driven by economic interests. Different interest subjects pursuing their own economic interests in social life is an objective law. People can establish various economic laws, regulations, and institutions, and use economic, legal, and administrative means to guide, coordinate, regulate, and facilitate various economic interests, but they cannot change the law that people always pursue their own economic interests. They can only adapt to the requirements of this law. The traditional public ownership economy lacks this internal economic interest mechanism, thus losing its vitality, which is the fundamental reason for the low efficiency of the public ownership economy. Therefore, the issue is not whether the form of public ownership is desirable, but whether the public ownership economy has a corresponding economic interest mechanism.

The traditional public ownership economy lacks an interest mechanism, mainly manifested in three aspects: First, there is no independent, personalized interest subject, lacking internal interest motivation; second, there is no direct interest link between various interest subjects, causing mutual interest disconnection; third, the relationship between various interest subjects and the state is a subordinate one, unable to realize their deserved interests through equivalent exchange. These problems boil down to one point: the interests of the state, the collective, and the enterprise have not been properly handled.

In the past, legitimate personal interests and enterprise interests were regarded as heresy and were always suppressed; while the erroneous theory of "the big river has water, the small river is full; the big river has no water, the small river is dry" was regarded as the criterion for handling the economic interest relationship between the state, the collective, and individuals, and was widely promoted for many years. In fact, the small river is the "source," and the big river is the "flow." The natural law is "the small river has water, the big river is full; the small river has no water, the big river is dry." Past economic policies often drained the small river (individuals and enterprises) dry, cutting off the water source, resulting in the big river (the state) always being unsatisfied and unable to get rich quickly, causing the growth of state and collective interests to lose connection with the increase of personal interests, and even reducing people's concern for the growth of state and collective interests. Therefore, to establish an interest mechanism for the public ownership economy, the first step is to respect the personal interests of laborers, encourage laborers to fully realize their personal value and legitimate interests, and thus build the collective and state interests on the basis of the personal interests of each laborer, which can fundamentally improve the efficiency of the public ownership economy.

Equivalent exchange is the basic principle of commodity economy and the basis for establishing the interest mechanism of the public ownership economy. Only by establishing the various interest relationships of the public ownership economy on the basis of equivalent exchange can the relationship between various interest subjects of the public ownership economy be properly handled.

The traditional socialist public ownership economy lacks an interest mechanism, mainly because it opposes public ownership with commodity economy and adopts a series of policies and measures to restrict and even eliminate commodity-monetary relations, turning the public ownership economy into a natural economy and product economy that excludes commodity exchange and market mechanisms. Historical experience and reform practices have proven that the view and practice of artificially opposing public ownership with commodity economy are wrong. The two should and can be organically combined. Under the commodity economy model based on public ownership, the interest mechanism of the public ownership economy will mainly be established through the implementation of the principle of equivalent exchange of commodities. Equivalent exchange is the basic principle of commodity economy, the connection point between public ownership and commodity economy, and the basis for establishing the interest mechanism of the public ownership economy. Only by establishing the various interest relationships of the public ownership economy on the basis of equivalent exchange can it adapt to the requirements of the development of commodity economy and properly handle the relationship between various interest subjects of the public ownership economy.

The interest mechanism of the public ownership economy is an organic system that is both interrelated and interdependent. At present, it mainly includes the following four mechanisms:

Interest incentive mechanism. The prerequisite for establishing an interest incentive mechanism is to clearly recognize that the various interest subjects of the public ownership economy have their own independent economic interests and to properly handle the relationship between the commonality and independence of interests. In the past, we emphasized the commonality of interests in economic life while ignoring the independence of interests, denying interest differences, and practicing "one leveling and two adjustments" among various interest subjects, violating the principle of equivalent exchange, and forming an egalitarian pattern where enterprises perform well or poorly in the same way, and workers work more or less in the same way. Therefore, to establish an interest incentive mechanism for the public ownership economy, it is necessary to recognize the independence of various interest subjects and protect the right of various interest subjects to pursue their deserved interests. This is an effective means to mobilize the enthusiasm of various interest subjects and individuals and a fundamental way to improve the efficiency of the public ownership economy.

Interest adjustment mechanism. In contrast to the interest incentive mechanism, the interest adjustment mechanism is a necessary adjustment for the independence and differences of various interest subjects, mainly to solve the problem of the commonality of interests among various interest subjects, that is, the relationship between the state, which represents the common interests of the whole society, and various interest subjects. If only the independence and differences of interests are recognized while ignoring the commonality of interests, it will also cause disorder in social economic life and create new problems of unfair interest distribution. Because the various interest differences formed through the interest incentive mechanism, although some are legal, may not be reasonable; some may even be neither legal nor reasonable. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a corresponding interest adjustment mechanism to conduct necessary primary or secondary adjustments from a macro perspective. Generally speaking, the adjustment means for establishing an interest adjustment mechanism include economic means, legal means, and administrative means, but mainly rely on economic means. Prices, taxes, finance, credit, and exchange rates are the main economic means for adjusting domestic and foreign economic interests, and fiscal subsidies and interest subsidies are supplementary means for interest adjustment when necessary. The subject of using these interest adjustment means is, of course, the state. The state, through the comprehensive use of these interest adjustment means, embodies the principle of commonality of interests in the public ownership economy, achieving the goal of allowing some regions, enterprises, and individuals to get rich first while realizing the common prosperity of the whole society.

Interest balancing mechanism. It mainly solves the problem of the interest relationship between various independent interest subjects. The main means for various interest subjects to achieve interest balance is to implement equivalent exchange. Equivalent exchange is a relatively acceptable interest balancing method for various interest subjects under the conditions of commodity economy. In social economic life, whether it is between regions, departments, enterprises, commodity producers, individuals, or between the state, the collective, and individuals, short-term and temporary unpaid assistance and cooperation are indispensable at any time, but long-term interest connections must be established on the basis of equivalent exchange. Only through equivalent exchange can mutual interest balance be achieved.

Interest constraint mechanism. There is both an interdependent and interdependent aspect to the relationship between various interest subjects. Therefore, any interest subject must have external interest constraints. This interest constraint is sometimes an objective economic constraint, sometimes a legal or administrative compulsory constraint. Due to the existence of this interest constraint mechanism, no interest subject can act arbitrarily just to pursue its own interests. Within the interest subject, it is also necessary to establish a self-interest constraint mechanism, which is currently a weak link. For example, some interest subjects have short-term behaviors, some contracted enterprises and contractors only care about their own interests without considering the interests of others, only care about partial interests without considering overall interests, only care about immediate interests without considering long-term interests, and so on. This shows that establishing a self-interest constraint mechanism for interest subjects is an urgent task. In fact, the lack of a self-interest constraint mechanism for interest subjects not only harms the interests of others, the overall situation, and the long term, but first and foremost harms their own interests. Therefore, we must establish a self-interest constraint mechanism in the reform, actively guide various interest subjects to consciously combine their own interests with the interests of others, partial interests with overall interests, and immediate interests with long-term interests, and promote the coordinated development of various interests.

Various contract management responsibility systems are not only a form of management responsibility system but also an interest mechanism of the public ownership economy, an effective form of handling various interest relationships of the public ownership economy.

In China's social economic life, five aspects of interest relationships need to be coordinated and handled: first, the state and enterprises; second, enterprises and employees; third, the central government and local governments; fourth, vertical and horizontal systems; fifth, collectives and farmers. At present, these interest relationships can be better solved through the implementation of various forms of contract systems. The secret to the contract system achieving satisfactory results in urban and rural reforms in China lies in its ability to handle various interest relationships and form a new interest mechanism.

First, through contracting, an interest incentive mechanism can be formed. The contract base represents the acquired interests, and since the contract protects the acquired interests, it can be accepted by the relevant parties; while the proportion of remittance or sharing represents the distribution method of new interests, generally the more the base is exceeded, the larger the proportion left to the contractor, and the greater the contribution to the state, thus forming an interest incentive mechanism.

Second, through contracting, an interest adjustment mechanism can be established. Enterprise contracting is generally carried out after the enterprise pays the three turnover taxes (i.e., business tax, product tax, and value-added tax) on the enterprise profits, which is a secondary adjustment of the enterprise's post-tax profits after the initial interest adjustment through taxation. The contract base and remittance ratio are essentially the state's interest adjustment lever for the enterprise. The state, through this interest adjustment means, can eliminate some non-operational factors of the enterprise in achieving profits, thus solving the problem of interest imbalance among enterprises due to different objective conditions.

Third, through contracting, an interest balancing mechanism can be constructed. Due to historical, economic, geographical, and other reasons, the economic development of various regions and enterprises in China is extremely imbalanced. In the past, attempts were made to use a standardized method to solve the interest distribution problem of various enterprises, for example, stipulating that all enterprises pay corporate income tax to the state at the same rate, but this resulted in an extremely unstandardized result: some enterprises had a lot of profits after tax, while others had almost nothing left, and many loss-making enterprises could not be maintained, and had to implement a per-unit profit adjustment tax to achieve interest balance. The contract system uses non-standardized means to solve the interest distribution problem of different enterprises, but achieves a relatively standardized result: that is, it realizes the interest balance between enterprises and initially solves the problem of unequal distribution of interests. It is this interest balancing mechanism that enables the contract system to be widely promoted in different regions and enterprises.

Fourth, through contracting, an interest constraint mechanism can be created. The contract is a document with legal binding force, which implements a two-way constraint on the responsibilities, rights, and interests of the contractor and the contracting party. Any party that violates the contract provisions or fails to fulfill the contract will bear the corresponding economic responsibility. The contract is both a protective umbrella for state interests and a protective charm for enterprise interests. Within the enterprise, after layer-by-layer contracting, the interest constraint mechanism for the enterprise itself and internal employees begins to be established, thus forming an interest community inside and outside the enterprise where all parties share weal and woe.

Indeed, the contract system still has many shortcomings and needs to be further developed and improved. The important thing is that the contract system both adheres to public ownership and improves the efficiency of public ownership; it both forms a new interest mechanism and promotes the development of commodity economy, turning the original low-efficiency and ineffective public ownership into efficient and high-efficiency public ownership.

　　公有制·利益机制·承包制
    宋廷明
    问题不在于公有制是否可取，而在于公有制经济内部缺乏一套相应
    的经济利益机制。
    经济体制改革说到底是经济利益关系的全面调整和经济利益的重新分配。任何一项经济改革措施出台，都会直接或间接地涉及到不同法人和自然人的经济利益。不是一方增加一些经济利益，就是另一方减少某些经济利益。由于各种经济利益关系的制约，常常使得某些改革措施难于顺利出台或者不得不作出某种妥协或让步。
    经济利益是社会经济发展的原动力。在经济生活中，一切经济活动无不受人的行为的支配，而人的行为又是受经济利益驱动。不同的利益主体在社会生活中追求自身经济利益是客观规律，人们可以通过建立各种经济法律、规章、制度，运用经济的、法律的和行政的手段来引导、协调、节制和疏通各方面的经济利益，但无法改变人总是要追求自身的经济利益的规律，而只能适应这一规律的要求。传统公有制经济缺乏的正是这种内在的经济利益机制，因而失去了它应有的生机与活力，这是目前公有制经济低效率的根本原因。因此，问题不在于公有制形式是否可取，而在于公有制经济内部有没有一套相应的经济利益机制。
    传统的公有制经济缺乏利益机制，主要表现在三个方面：第一，没有一个独立的、人格化的利益主体，缺乏内在的利益动机；第二，各利益主体之间没有直接的利益联系纽带，造成了相互利益脱节；第三，各利益主体与国家之间是一种附属关系，无法通过等价交换实现自己的应得利益。这些问题集中到一点，就是没有正确处理好国家、集体和企业三者之间的利益关系。
    过去，正当的个人利益和企业利益被视为异端，总是受到压抑；而颠倒源流关系的“大河有水小河满、大河无水小河干”的错误理论，却被奉为处理国家、集体、个人三者经济利益关系的准则，多年来大加提倡。本来，小河是“源”，大河是“流”，自然界的规律是“小河有水大河满，小河无水大河干”。过去的经济政策往往是竭泽而渔，把小河（个人和企业）的水全部抽光，切断了水源，结果大河（国家）总是不满，迟迟富不起来，使国家、集体利益的增长和个人利益的增进失去了联系，反而降低了人们对国家和集体利益增长的关切程度。可见，要建立公有制经济的利益机制，首先就要尊重劳动者的个人利益，鼓励劳动者去充分实现自己的人生价值和合法利益，从而把集体利益和国家利益建立在每个劳动者的个人利益的基础之上，才能从根本上提高公有制经济的效率。
    　等价交换是商品经济的基本原则，是建立公有制经济利益机制
   的基础。只有把公有制经济各种利益关系建立在等价交换的基础上，
    才能摆正公有制经济各利益主体之间的关系。
    传统的社会主义公有制经济之所以缺乏利益机制，主要就是把公有制与商品经济对立起来，采取了一系列限制甚至消灭商品货币关系的政策和措施，把公有制经济搞成了一种排斥商品交换和市场机制的自然经济和产品经济。历史的经验和改革的实践已经证明，人为地把公有制与商品经济对立起来的观点和做法都是错误的，两者不仅应该而且可以有机地结合起来。在以公有制为基础的商品经济模式下，公有制经济的利益机制主要将通过实行商品等价交换的原则来建立。等价交换是商品经济的基本原则，是公有制与商品经济的衔接点，也是建立公有制经济利益机制的基础。只有把公有制经济的各种利益关系建立在等价交换的基础之上，才能适应商品经济发展的要求，摆正公有制经济各种利益主体之间的关系。
    公有制经济的利益机制是一个既互相联系而又互相制约的有机体系。现在看来，主要应包括以下四种机制：
    利益激励机制。建立利益激励机制的前提是要明确承认公有制经济各种利益主体有自己独立的经济利益，正确处理好利益的共同性和独立性之间的关系。过去，我们在经济生活中片面强调利益的共同性而忽视利益的独立性，否定利益差异，在各种利益主体之间搞“一平二调”，违背等价交换的原则，形成了企业经营好坏一个样、职工干多干少一个样的平均主义格局。因此，要建立公有制经济的利益激励机制，就必须承认各利益主体的独立性，保护各种利益主体追求自己应得利益的权利。这是调动各种利益主体和劳动者个人积极性的有效手段，也是提高公有制经济效益的基本途径。
    利益调节机制。与利益激励机制相反，利益调节机制则是针对各利益主体的利益独立性和差异性所进行的必要调节，主要是解决各利益主体的利益共同性问题，即代表全社会共同利益的国家与各利益主体之间的关系问题。如果只承认利益的独立性和差异性，忽视利益的共同性，同样会造成社会经济生活的紊乱，出现新的利益分配不公正的问题。因为通过利益激励机制形成的各种利益差别，有的虽然合法，但不一定合理；有的甚至既不合法，又不合理。因此，必须通过建立相应的利益调节机制，从宏观上进行必要的初次调节或二次调节。一般地讲，建立利益调节机制的调节手段有经济手段、法律手段和行政手段，但主要应该依靠经济手段。价格、税收、财政、信贷和汇率等经济杠杆，是进行内外经济利益调节的主要经济手段，必要时还要运用财政补贴、贴息等补充手段进行利益调节。运用这些利益调节手段的主体当然是国家。国家通过综合运用这些利益调节手段体现公有制经济利益共同性的原则，达到既允许一部分地区、企业和个人先富起来，又能实现整个社会共同富裕的目标。
    利益平衡机制。它主要是解决各独立利益主体互相之间的利益关系问题。各利益主体之间实现利益平衡的主要手段是实行等价交换。等价交换是在商品经济条件下各利益主体之间较易接受的一种利益平衡方式。在社会经济生活中，无论是地区之间、部门之间、企业之间、商品生产者个人之间，还是国家、集体与个人之间，短期的、暂时的无偿支援和协作在任何时候都是必不可少的，但长期的利益联系必需建立在等价交换的基础之上，只有通过等价交换才能实现相互之间的利益平衡。
    利益约束机制。各利益主体之间既有利益相互联系的一面，又有利益相互制约的一面。因此，任何一个利益主体，都要有来自外部的利益约束。这种利益约束有时是客观的经济性约束，有时是法律的或行政的强制性约束。由于这种利益约束机制的存在，使得每一个利益主体都不可能单纯为了追求自身的利益而为所欲为。在利益主体的内部，还必须建立起自我约束的利益机制，这是当前的薄弱环节。例如，有些利益主体存在着短期化的行为，有的承包企业和承包者只顾自身利益不顾他人利益，只顾局部利益不顾全局利益，只顾眼前利益不顾长远利益，等等。这说明，建立利益主体的自我利益约束机制是当务之急。实际上，缺乏自我约束机制的利益主体，损害的不仅是他人、全局和长远利益，而且首先损害了自身的利益。因此，我们必须在改革中建立自我约束的利益机制，积极引导各种利益主体自觉地把自身与他人、局部与全局、眼前与长远的利益有机地结合起来，促进各方面利益的协调发展。
　　　　各种承包经营责任制，不仅是一种经营责任制形式，也是一种公有制经济的利益机制，是处理公有制经济的各种利益关系的一个有效形式。
    在我国社会经济生活中，需要协调和处理好五方面的利益关系：一是国家与企业，二是企业与职工，三是中央与地方，四是条条与块块，五是集体与农民。当前，这些利益关系都可以通过实行多种形式的承包制得到较好的解决。承包制能在我国城乡改革中取得令人满意的效果，其秘诀就在于用它可以处理好各方面的利益关系，形成一种新的利益机制。
    第一，通过承包可以形成一种利益激励机制。承包基数代表了既得利益，由于承包维护了既得利益，因而它能为有关各方所接受；而上缴或分成的比例则代表了新增利益的分配方式，一般是超基数越多，留给承包者的比例越大，同时对国家的贡献越大，从而形成了一种利益激励机制。
    第二，通过承包可以建立一种利益调节机制。企业承包一般是在上缴流转三税（即工商税、产品税和增值税）后对企业利润实行承包，是通过税收进行初次利益调节以后对企业税后利润的第二次调节。承包的基数和上缴比例，实质上是国家对企业进行利益调节的杠杆。国家通过这种利益调节手段，可以剔除企业某些非经营因素对实现利润的影响，从而解决企业之间由于客观条件不同而造成的利益不均问题。
    第三，通过承包可以构造一种利益平衡机制。由于历史的、经济的、地理的等原因，我国地区之间、企业之间的经济发展极不平衡。过去试图用一种规范的办法来解决千差万别的企业的利益分配问题，例如规定企业都按同一个税率向国家上缴所得税，却形成了一个极不规范的结果：有的企业纳税后留利很多，有的企业却所剩无几，许多亏损企业则无法维持，不得不搞一个一户一率的利润调节税来求得利益平衡。承包制采用非规范的手段来解决不同企业的利益分配问题，却得到了一个大体规范的结果：即实现了企业之间的利益平衡，初步解决了利益分配上的苦乐不均问题。正是这种利益平衡机制，使承包能够在不同地区和企业里广泛推行。
    第四，通过承包可以创建一种利益约束机制。承包合同是一种具有法律约束力的文书，对承包者和发包者的责、权、利关系实行双向约束，任何一方违反了合同规定或不兑现合同，都要承担相应的经济责任。承包合同既是国家利益的保护伞，也是企业利益的护身符。在企业内部，层层承包以后也开始建立起对企业自身和内部职工的利益约束机制，从而使企业内外形成了一个一荣俱荣、一损俱损的利益共同体。
    诚然，承包制还存在许多不足，需要进一步发展和完善。重要的是，承包制既坚持了公有制，又提高了公有制的效率；既形成了新的利益机制，又促进了商品经济的发展，使原来低效率和无效率的公有制变成了有效率和高效率的公有制。
