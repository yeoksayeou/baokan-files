China's football team secured a spot in the semi-finals of the 20th King's Cup in Bangkok tonight. They defeated the defending champions, Denmark, 1-0 in the B group preliminary round. With four wins and one draw, China topped the group and earned a place in the semi-finals.

The match against Denmark was crucial for both teams, determining who would advance. For China, it was a do-or-die situation; only a victory would secure their spot in the semi-finals. China played cautiously, aiming for a win. With just five minutes left, China launched a swift counterattack. A Danish player committed a foul in the penalty area, giving China a direct free kick opportunity just outside the box. Instead of shooting directly at the goal, the Chinese player passed the ball to Li Hongbing, who was about 10 meters away from the Danish goal. Li Hongbing then kicked the ball, which hit a Danish player's leg and bounced into the net, securing the winning goal for China.

In other news, the Chinese men's volleyball team finished fourth in the Iran International Volleyball Tournament on February 5. The Soviet Union, Japan, and Iran took the first, second, and third places, respectively.

In the match against Iran for third place, China lost 2-3. The Iranian newspaper "World News" commented that both teams had similar strengths, but China's morale was higher. The main reason for China's loss was attributed to "unfair refereeing."

　　我足球队获泰王杯半决赛权
　　中国男排获伊朗排球赛第四名
    新华社曼谷２月６日电  （记者张秋来）中国队今晚在这里举行的第２０届泰王杯足球赛Ｂ组预赛中，以１∶０战胜上届冠军丹麦队，从而以四战三胜一平的战绩名列这个组第一和赢得了半决赛权。
    中丹今晚之战是决定谁能出线的关键之战，对中国队来说则是背水一战，只有获胜才能出线，平或负都将失去半决赛权。中国队为力争取胜而踢得较为稳健。直至比赛还剩最后５分钟时，中国队发起一次快速反击。丹麦队员在防守中犯规，使中国队在对方禁区外获罚直接任意球的机会。中国队的罚球队员没有将球直接踢向丹麦队球门，而是轻传给离丹麦队禁区外约１０米远正对丹麦大门的５号李红兵。李红兵大脚劲射，球碰在对方队员的腿上弹起掉入丹麦队大门，为中国队取得了决定性的一分。
    新华社德黑兰２月６日电　中国男子排球队在５日结束的伊朗国际排球赛上，获得第四名。
    苏联、日本和伊朗队分获第一、第二和第三名。
    中国队在５日与伊朗队争夺第三名的比赛中，以２∶３失利。伊朗《世界报》在评论这场球时说，中、伊两队实力差不多，但中国队的士气比对方高。中国队输球的主要原因是“裁判不公正”。
