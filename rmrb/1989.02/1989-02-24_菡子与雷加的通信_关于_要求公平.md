Hanzi:

It has been a long time since we last communicated. I never expected that this time I would have to write with my left hand...

On the 21st, I had to go to work and the bus was crowded. I was considerate and stood at the back. Suddenly, a strong young man pushed past from the side, knocking me down onto the curb a yard away. I was dazed at the time, but I still managed to go to the office to find a car to take me to the hospital. I initially thought I hadn't injured my head, but later the X-ray confirmed a fracture in my right wrist, which was put in a cast. I was relieved it wasn't a comminuted fracture (later, an expert reviewed the X-ray and found it was a severe comminuted fracture, difficult to treat, and even if healed, it would not fully recover). The doctor said the pain wasn't as bad as expected, and I guess I was numb. Someone blamed me for not catching the culprit, but how could I have the presence of mind and strength to do so, and besides, I didn't care about some random person who pushes others, that represents a certain atmosphere, and it's the Respect for the Elderly Festival now. That night, I tossed and turned, unable to sleep, and only then did I realize the severity of injuring a bone. I couldn't help but think that the person who pushed me was probably sleeping soundly at that moment, feeling it was unfair, but then I thought, why should I demand fairness?

The most difficult part is not being able to write freely. I regret the time I wasted in the past, but even with a good hand, I haven't written good articles. But I still have to deal with this cold and lonely winter and the long, cold nights. So, I recite short essays, practice writing, and even write a bone fracture diary, thinking I can train myself to be a left-hander like others. But it's not that easy. Seeing the white paper filled with my own unrecognizable, crooked words, I really wanted to cry. Hey, it's strange, but when I think of the letter you wrote to me, I feel energized. That year, you went with the team to the northwest to watch the satellite launch, and then without stopping, you followed it to the East China Sea to observe the "recovery." When you left Beijing, people asked if you could handle it. You calmly said, "I can take care of myself." That year, you were already over seventy, and you spent a few months each year traveling to the border. Every time I think of your confession, I choke up, and when I read your articles, I always feel there is that element in them, which gives me strength. I will take you as an example. Many friends have come to visit and help. Please don't worry.

Best regards,
Hanzi

Leiga:

I always feel that "fate" has been unfair to you. You couldn't attend the National Writers' Congress, and now this misfortune has befallen you. Today, I want to live, regardless of whether others do or not. There are indeed many such things. It's just that honest people suffer more. I have long called you in my heart: you are a kind-hearted, unlucky person. As you said, why catch the culprit; he knocked you down and is now sleeping soundly, while you toss and turn and say to yourself: why demand fairness?

But you are also a strong person, not one of those who call themselves "strong men." Those who are not willing to fall behind in life are strong. Those who have lifelong pursuits and can continuously satisfy such noble desires are strong. In this regard, you are ahead of me. I started writing essays late, and it was your inspiration. I'm not talking about general essays, but how to infuse life and the spirit of the times into essays. Otherwise, why do you love life so much, establish so many points in life, and make so many friends in life? Just like you encountered, there are people who knock you down, but there are also many "friends who come to visit and help."

Perhaps, my trip to Inner Mongolia and the Three Borders (note: the northern part of Shaanxi, Jingbian, Anbian, Dingbian) was the peak of my travels. I'm talking about travel, not tourism. Writers need to travel with their bags. For me, this kind of travel is not too much, but too little. China is so vast, it is indeed a writer's happiness. I always feel a surge of passion on the road, and I can't help but write letters. I really did write letters, and why send them to you, this is self-evident. I believe you will read it word by word, you read not empty words, but from it, you seek life. Otherwise, after being knocked down and lying in bed, you wouldn't have said in one breath: Mongolian yurt, Jingbian, and what about talking about Prishvin.

You mentioned the letter from Jingbian, I have sorted it out and plan to include it in my uncollected works. Due to the Jingbian trip, I wrote an essay "Water" upon my return, with over ten thousand words. I was very satisfied with it at the time, including its flaw—the length. You think an essay of over ten thousand words, wouldn't it scare people away? Moreover, my idea was so vast... I showed this article to Qin Zhaoyang. He read it and seriously wrote down his opinions. He was also scared away. I was not satisfied with his strictness. However, I have never opposed the idea that articles should be short and concise. Later, I divided this essay into three parts, taking the middle part of "Water" and sending it to "Hunan Literature" for publication. The last part was renamed "Dry Plateau," with the subtitle "Continuation of Water," and was published in "China Environmental News," and even won an honorary award. The first part was titled "The Scenery of Lines" and was prepared to be sent to "World of Essays." This experience made me understand: life can be tailored, it is not afraid of tailoring, the important thing is not to lack life. Without life, a hundred words are also redundant.

This letter, written with my right hand, should not be longer than your letter written with your left hand. Your letter really surprised me, and as I read it, I couldn't control myself. Who can resist the impact of emotions, who can't think of themselves from others' experiences? But in the end, I want to say, for health, for beneficial entertainment, I still enjoy riding my bicycle. I don't believe my bones are that fragile.

Sincerely,
Leiga

### 菡子与雷加的通信  关于“要求公平”

　　菡子与雷加的通信
    关于“要求公平”
    雷加：
    好久未通音讯，想不到这次要用左手来写……
    我２１号上班有事，车挤，我很识相站后边，不知哪个心急而有劲的后生从横里冲来，把我推倒在一丈远的街沿石上。当时昏麻，不过还知道去机关找车就医。先还侥幸未伤头部，后来照片确诊右腕部骨折，上了石膏，又庆幸不是粉碎性的（后来经专家看片是严重粉碎性骨折，难治，治愈后也难复原）。医生拉住对位也没有想象的痛，我大约麻木了。有人怪我没有捉住肇事者，我哪有这份灵清和力气，而且不在乎一个任意推人者，那是代表一种风气，现在还正有敬老节呢。晚上辗转翻侧不能入眠，才晓得伤筋动骨的厉害。不免想到推我者此时正在呼呼大睡，觉得不公平，转念一想，我又何必要求公平。
    最难堪的是不能写作自如，很后悔过去流失的时间，其实手好也没有写出好文章。但总得应付这冷冷清清的冬日和漫长的寒夜，于是背短文、默写，还涂什么骨折日记，自认为能像别人那样练成一个左撇子。谈何容易，看到白纸上一片自己也不认识的弯弯扭扭的字，真想大哭一场。嗨，真怪，一想到你给我写的一封信，我来劲了，那年你随团先去大西北看卫星上天，后来马不停蹄跟踪到东海观察“回收”。在北京出发时人们问你行么？你淡淡地说：“我可以自理生活。”那年你已七十出头，一年总有几个月跑边疆。每想起你的这句自白，我哽咽着，读你的文章时，总觉也有这句话的成分，对我就是有力量的。愿以你为表率。友人来看望相助的不少。请勿挂念。　　　　　　　　　　　祝健安
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　菡子
    　　　　　　　　　　　　１９８８年１１月２６日菡子：
    我总觉得“命运”对你有欠公允。全国作协理事会你不能来，又遭此不幸。今天，我要活不管别人活不活的事，确实不少，偏偏老实人受气，又更其多。我早已在心中这样叫你了：你是一个好心的倒霉的人。像你说的，何必捉住那个肇事者；他撞了你之后呼呼大睡，你辗转翻侧却又自言自语：何必要求公平。
    但你又是一个强者，不是那些自称为“强人”的强者。不甘落后于生活的就是强者。终生有所追求又能不断满足这种高尚欲望的，就是强者。这一点，你走在我的前面。我写散文起步晚，又是受了你的启示的。我说的不是一般散文，而是如何把生活和时代的气息撒到散文中去的那种。不然，你为什么那么热爱生活，在生活建立那么多点，又在生活中交结那么多朋友。正像你遇到的，有推倒你的人，又有不少“友人来看望相助”。
    也许，我去内蒙古和三边（注）是我旅行的高峰。我说的旅行不同于旅游。作家需要背着行囊旅行。这种旅行对我来说，不是多了，而是少了。中国之大，实在是作家的幸福。我在旅途中总是激起一股股热浪，禁不住要写信。确实也写了信，为什么要寄给你，这是不言而喻的。我相信你会一字一字地读它，你读的不是空洞的字，而是从中寻觅生活。不然，你被撞倒卧床之后就不会一口气说出蒙古包、靖边，还有什么谈普里希文的。
    你提到靖边那封信，我已整理出来准备收进我的未结集里。由于靖边之行，我归来写了一篇散文《水》，长达万余字。当初我很满意，连同它的缺点——长度。你想万余字的散文，还不把人吓住。何况我的构思又是那么海阔天空……这篇文章我给秦兆阳看过。他看过，又认真写下了意见。他也被吓住了。我可不满意他如此苛求。不过，我也从不反对文章以短小为佳。后来我把这篇散文分为三段，截取《水》的中段，送《湖南文学》发表了。末段改题《旱塬》，副题“水的续篇”，在《中国环境报》发表，竟评了荣誉奖。头段又题为《线的风光》，准备送给《散文世界》。这一次经历，使我懂得了：生活是可以剪裁的，是不怕剪裁的，重要的是不能没有生活。没有生活的话，一百字也是多余的。
    这封用右手写的信不宜长于你用左手写的信。你的信真的使我吃了一惊，读到后来我竟不能自制了。谁能抵抗感情的冲击，谁能不从别人的遭遇中想到自己。但是最后我要说，为了健康，为了有益的消遣，我仍以骑自行车为乐。我不相信我的骨夹会酥到那个程度。
    　　　　专此敬礼
