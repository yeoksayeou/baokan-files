The Famen Temple in Fufeng County, Shaanxi Province, was built during the Eastern Han Dynasty and is renowned as the "ancestor of pagodas and temples in Guanzhong." Apart from the thirteen-tiered pagoda that collapsed in 1981, the remaining structures such as the Buddha Hall, the Great Hall, the Bell Tower, and the Drum Tower from the Ming and Qing dynasties still allow us to imagine its former glory. However, it is reported that this "provincial-level protected cultural relic" was planned to be demolished last year by the local government to rebuild a larger imitation of a Tang Dynasty structure. As the precious ancient site crumbles and a magnificent new building stands in its place, should we rejoice or lament?

Cultural relics have significant historical, artistic, and scientific value. Human efforts to preserve and maintain them reflect a deep contemplation of history and culture. From these valuable relics, we can see specific remnants of historical culture and understand their influence on and relationship with modern culture.

China has a history of several thousand years. The ancient architecture, like "birds shedding their feathers and soaring," is closely related to rituals and reflects a strict hierarchical system and mathematical models. The specifications for halls, chambers, and palaces all have standard dimensions, and even the types of bricks and tiles, window patterns, carving themes, and painted designs have strict regulations. This presents a high demand for the maintenance of ancient architecture. Since cultural relics are historical legacies, they have undergone the erosion of time, and their main characteristic is that they are old or incomplete. This is precisely their charm. Only by preserving the original appearance of the relics in restoration can they produce a contrast of ancient and modern, old and new, in modern life, making people appreciate or reflect. If they are painted and polished to look new and shiny, the ancient and rustic charm will disappear, and the relics will no longer look like relics. Especially when driven by the desire for grandeur and novelty, and limited by technological levels, some restored relics often have pillars and beams painted with colors that do not match the original appearance. Some even use modern materials like cement (such as the newly restored sections of the Great Wall). Visitors looking for the old find the new, which is quite disappointing. As for demolishing relics and rebuilding them without preserving the original appearance, even if they are grand and magnificent, they can only be considered fake antiques. Moreover, some rare treasures, once demolished, are irretrievably lost. If someone attempts to restore the Colosseum in ancient Rome and the Parthenon in ancient Greece, it would be laughable. When we travel the "Silk Road" and discover the ancient city of Loulan, which has turned into a mound in the vast desert, a historical question mark will surely enter our minds: Why did the once prosperous Loulan turn into a desert? This leads to deep reflections on its historical changes. If people insist on restoring the ancient city of Loulan, even if they could recreate its former glory, it would not achieve the same effect. Some cultural relics, such as ancient bells, are clearly marked as "replicas" after being copied. Some of our ancient buildings, after being demolished and rebuilt, are still claimed to be "authentic," which is deceitful. In the protection of cultural relics, the practices of some countries are worth learning from. For example, the small city of Heidelberg in the Federal Republic of Germany has ancient castle walls that seem to be on the verge of collapse, but due to the use of advanced technology for maintenance, people can safely linger and stroll beneath them. In contrast, when will we get out of the vicious cycle of "restoring the old to look new"?

Cultural relics that have survived thousands of years of wind and rain are an important part of our great country's excellent cultural heritage. We should neither waste them by letting them deteriorate naturally nor do the foolish thing of "destructive restoration" in the name of love. We should strive to improve our awareness of cultural relics and restoration technology, adhere to the spirit of respecting history and science, and truly achieve "restoring the old to look old." This way, the relics can greet the present with an ancient, elegant, and dignified demeanor and be passed down to future generations.

　　旧貌何须换新颜
    郑凯歌
    陕西扶风县境内的法门寺，始建于东汉，素有“关中塔庙始祖”之誉。除十三级宝塔于１９８１年倒塌外，从尚存的佛殿、大雄宝殿、钟楼与鼓楼等一组明清建筑上，仍能想象当年的盛况。然而，据报载，这个“省级文物保护单位”，去年当地政府却计划拆毁，重建一座规模更大的仿唐建筑。宝贵的古迹轰然倒下，辉煌的新建筑巍然立起之时，当喜耶？忧耶？
    文物古迹具有重要的历史、艺术和科学价值，人类致力于保存与维护它，表现出对历史、文化的深刻思索。从有价值的古迹上，我们可见到历史文化的若干具体的遗留，了解其对现代文化的影响及继承关系。
    我国有着几千年的历史，“如鸟斯革，如翚斯飞”的古代建筑，其艺术形式与礼密切相关，体现了严密的等级制度和数学模式，室、堂、宫等的规格均有标准尺寸，甚至对砖瓦种类、门窗格纹、雕刻题材、彩画式样等也有严格规定，这给古建筑的维修工作提出比较高的要求。文物古迹既然是历史遗留下来的，历经岁月的侵蚀，其主要特征就是旧，或者是残缺不全，这正是它的魅力所在。只有在修复中努力保持古迹的原来风貌，才可以在现代生活中产生一种古与今、新与旧对比的美，令人欣赏或沉思。如果把其粉刷油漆得容光焕发、流彩溢金、旧貌变新颜，古朴、幽旧的古意荡然无存，古迹就不像是古迹了。特别是由于某种贪大求新的思想作怪，加之技术水平所限，有的古迹修缮后往往殿堂梁柱油漆彩画与原貌不符，甚至有的竟用了近代才有的水泥等材料，（如万里长城新修复的城段），造访者寻觅到此，不知是访旧还是观新，实是煞风景。至于把古迹拆掉重建而未保持原来风貌，即使再高大辉煌也只能算是假古董了。况且，一些稀世之珍拆毁后是根本无法修复的。如果有人试图恢复古罗马科洛塞奥竞技场和古希腊帕提侬神庙，一定会滑天下之大稽。当我们跋涉在漫漫的“丝绸之路”，发现了那在浩瀚的大漠中已化为土丘似的楼兰古城时，一个历史的大问号一定会蓦地进入脑海：当年富庶繁荣的楼兰为何变为一片荒漠？从而对其历史变迁发出深深的思索。如果人们硬要把楼兰古城修复起来，即使能重现当年的盛景也达不到这种效果。一些文物例如古编钟等被人们复制后明确无误地标为“复制品”，我们的一些古建筑被拆毁，重建后偏偏仍以“真迹”自居，实有欺世之嫌。在保护文物古迹方面，一些国家的做法很值得我们学习借鉴。如联邦德国有个小城海德堡，尽管古城堡的断墙有摇摇欲坠之感，但由于采用了先进的技术进行了维修，人们可以放心地在墙下留连徜徉。相比之下，我们什么时候才能从“整旧如新”的怪圈中走出来呢？
    经历千百年的风风雨雨而得以保存下来的文物古迹，是我们伟大祖国优秀文化遗产的重要组成部分，我们既不能暴殄天物，任其自然颓毁，也不能干名为爱之实则害之的“破坏性修复”的蠢事，应努力提高我们的文物意识和修缮技术，本着尊重历史和科学的精神，真正做到“修旧如旧”，使古迹能以古朴、典雅和庄重的姿态迎接今人，留给后人。
