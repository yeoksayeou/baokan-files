He and the Grain
— A Record of the 96-Year-Old Red Army Veteran Li Fanghan
    By Liu Heng, Reporter of People's Daily

    Perhaps it was because he had suffered from hunger in his childhood and youth, Li Fanghan, in 1955, was transferred to the grain depot in Baotou, Inner Mongolia. He was like a fish that had found water and did not want to leave.

    At first, everyone thought he was a bit strange: a respected grain depot director, at the age of 63, did not sleep in the warm bed with his wife and children, but instead went to live with the young people in a collective dormitory, sleeping in a leaky room. Early in the morning, before the sky was light, he would get out of bed, poke the stove, start the fire, boil water, sweep the floor, and ring the wake-up bell. One day, the grain bureau 15 miles away held a cadre meeting. Everyone rode their bicycles, but Li Fanghan, who couldn't ride a bike, walked. Unexpectedly, when everyone arrived by bike, he had also arrived on foot.

    When the strange incident spread, everyone knew: Li Fanghan was the "flying legs" who had walked 25,000 miles during the Long March. They gathered around him to listen to his Long March stories. He said:

    "The most profound impression I have of the Long March is the word 'hunger.' We were so hungry that our skin clung to our bones, the world spun, and we were between life and death. During the march, we didn't stop walking, and we didn't dare sit down, for if we sat down, we couldn't get up again. We drank water and ate snow, ate yaks, and donkeys. Even the horse that Marshal He Long rode was killed. We boiled it without adding oil or salt, whether it was raw or cooked, we ate it with the fur and skin. Later, we ate leather belts and cowhide soles. I was in charge of more than a dozen pairs of cowhide soles, distributing them to everyone. We monitored each other to prevent anyone from eating too much. One pair would last for one day..."

    "Why did I join the Red Army? It was still because of this 'hunger.' In my hometown of Jiangling, Hubei, there were floods year after year. My mother went out to beg for food and never returned. My father starved to death. I worked as a farmhand for a landlord. The landlord's granary was the mouth of the tiger for the poor; we couldn't even touch the edges. Now, the times have changed. We have the power over grain! The keys are in our hands. When we are full, we must not forget the hunger of the past, and we must cherish grain as gold."

    Li Fanghan spent his days wandering around the grain depot, inspecting and guarding against the grain becoming hot, infested with insects, moldy, scattered, or eaten by rats and birds. He had the "three knows upon entering the depot"—upon entering, he knew the temperature of the warehouse, the temperature of the grain, and if there was any unusual smell; "three knows with one grab"—with one grab, he knew the moisture content of the grain, the amount of impurities, and the grade. He said:

    "Under the grain bin, you should place sleepers, and surround it with mats on all sides. Mats are made of reeds, which grow in water and are not afraid of rain, so mats are not afraid of rain.

    "Storing grain in the depot has its own rules: hot wheat (wheat should be stored after being sun-dried), cold rice (rice should be stored after cooling down), sorghum must be winnowed thoroughly, and corn and sorghum should be stored in north and south rooms. Ventilation and sealing should be reasonable—use natural ventilation to replace sun-drying. Although the airflow is small, it is present 24 hours a day. After sealing, the grain lacks oxygen, and pests do not need to be fumigated, and high moisture content does not require turning and sun-drying.

    "Sun-drying grain is a major project in the grain depot. 'Grain depot sun-drying relies on the sky, wind and rain do not allow peace, feet trample, rake, and wooden shovel flip, good grain turns into broken half, spending tens of millions of yuan each year.' If the ventilation and sealing work is done well, less sun-drying is needed. Sorghum can be safely stored for eight years, wheat for nine years, and corn for five years.

    "Rats, birds, and insects are the enemies of the grain depot. We must find ways to eliminate rat holes, bird nests, and insect nests. The door of the depot should have rat guards. Inside the depot, holes and gaps should be filled and sealed, leaving no cracks. As the saying goes: 'Frogs in the well and maggots in the sauce, there are always insects in the rice.' However, in the grain depot, not a single insect can be left! They eat grain voraciously and reproduce quickly. If not careful, the grain depot will become an empty shell. 'Prevent in spring, isolate in summer, prevent in autumn, and kill in winter.' We must eliminate pests before they occur."

    In recent years, his wife, children, and grandchildren have moved into new apartment buildings. Li Fanghan still lives in the flat in the grain depot, with one room as an office and one as a bedroom, with a bathroom and heating installed. Sometimes his wife comes to visit him. She said: "Grain is his life. As long as he is not bedridden, he will wander everywhere. At night, he still takes a flashlight to check every corner. The depot is his home. If it rains or the wind blows, no matter how far he is, he rushes back home."

　　他和粮食
　　——记九十六岁老红军李方汉
    本报记者　刘衡
    也许是小时候、年轻时候饿怕了，李方汉１９５５年调到内蒙古包头粮库，就像鱼儿进了水，不肯游出来。
    开头，大伙儿觉得他有点怪：堂堂一位粮库主任，６３岁了，不到老婆、孩子那儿睡热炕头，偏偏跑来跟小青年一块挤集体宿舍、睡露天窟窿房。清早，天墨墨黑，他就钻出被窝，捅炉子、生火、烧水、扫地、打起床铃。有一天，１５里路外的粮食局召开干部会。人们骑上自行车，李方汉不会骑，就开步走。没想到：人们车子骑到，他人也走到了。
    怪事一传开，大伙都知道了：原来李方汉是走过二万五千里的“飞毛腿”，就围拢来要他讲长征故事。他讲：
    “长征给我印象最深的就是一个‘饿’字。饿得皮包骨头、天旋地转、死去活来。行军时，不停地走，不敢坐，坐下就起不来了。我们喝水吃雪、吃牦牛、吃骡子，连贺老总骑的马也杀了。只煮一下，不放油盐，不管生熟，连毛带皮一块吞。后来吃皮带、吃牛皮鞋底。我掌管十几双牛皮底鞋，给大家分。互相监督，不让多吃。一只要管一天……
    “我为啥参加红军？还不是因为这个‘饿’？湖北江陵老家连年水灾，母亲外出讨饭，一去没影，父亲活活饿死。我到地主家当长工。地主的粮仓是穷人的虎口，连边也沾不上。现在，天打了一个滚。粮权，我们掌了！钥匙，抓在我们手里，饱时不能忘了饿时饥，要惜粮如金。”
    李方汉成天围着粮库转悠、查看，防备粮食发热、生虫、霉烂、抛撒、被鼠咬雀吃。他“进库三知”——一进库，就知仓温、粮温、有无异味；“一抓三知”——用手一抓，就知粮食水分多高、杂质多大、什么等级。他说：
    “粮囤下边要放枕木，四周用席子围成。席子是苇子编的，苇子在水里生长，不怕水，所以席子不怕雨。
    “粮食入库很有讲究：热放麦（麦子晒热了放）、凉放米（米要凉透了再放）、谷子必须扇尽秕，高粱玉米南北房，通风密闭要合理——用自然通风法代替晒粮，风量虽小，但２４小时都有。密闭后粮食缺氧，生虫不用药薰，水分高不需倒仓翻晒。
    “晒粮是粮库的一大工程。‘粮库晒粮全靠天，刮风下雨不得安，脚趟、耙耧木锨翻，好粮变成破碎半，每年花费几十万’。通风密闭工作做好了，可以少晒粮。谷子能安全保管八年，小麦九年、玉米五年。
    “鼠、雀、虫是粮库的大敌，要想方设法杜绝鼠洞、雀窝、虫巢。库门要放挡鼠板。库内要填洞补空，不能留缝。俗话说：‘井里的蛤蟆酱里的蛆，米里的虫子是少不了的’。粮库里的虫子却一条也不能留！它吃谷猛、繁殖快，稍不注意，粮库将成为一仓空壳。‘春防入、夏隔离、秋防出、冬冷杀。’要使虫害消灭在发生之前。”
    前些年，老伴，孩子、孙子们搬进新楼房了。李方汉还是住在粮库的平房里，一间是办公室，一间是卧室，有卫生间，还安了暖气。有时他老伴来看他。她说：“粮是老汉的命，只要不卧床，他都到处转。每晚还要拿起手电筒，圪里角落照一遍。库是老汉的家。天阴了，刮风了，不管外出多远，赶紧往家奔。”
