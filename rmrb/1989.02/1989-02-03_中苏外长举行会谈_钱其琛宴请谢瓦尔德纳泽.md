Chinese and Soviet Foreign Ministers Hold Talks
Qian Qichen Hosts Dinner for Shevardnadze

BEIJING, Feb. 2 (Xinhua) — Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze held talks at the Great Hall of the People today. Qian said that this meeting is a continuation of the talks held two months ago in Moscow, both aimed at preparing for the upcoming high-level meeting between the two countries.

Qian first extended a warm welcome to Shevardnadze and his delegation. Shevardnadze thanked the Chinese side for their hospitality. He said that this meeting is the fifth time he has met with Qian in the past year, and the discussions this time are of significant importance.

During the talks, the two foreign ministers focused on the Cambodian issue. Qian said that the situation regarding the resolution of the Cambodian issue is developing, and it is crucial for all parties involved to engage in dialogue to achieve a political solution as soon as possible. The internal issues of Cambodia should be resolved by the Cambodian parties themselves without external interference. The international community should be concerned about the peace and stability of Cambodia after the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops and make efforts to resolve the internal issues of Cambodia fairly.

Shevardnadze said that the situation in Cambodia has undergone many changes recently, and the process of resolving the Cambodian issue has accelerated. He believes that the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Cambodia, the implementation of agreements reached by all parties in Cambodia, and the holding of free elections all require international supervision and guarantees from major powers. He also expressed that the dialogue among the Khmer parties should be actively carried out.

The two foreign ministers also discussed bilateral relations, including the border issue between China and the Soviet Union. The talks were conducted in a friendly, candid, and pragmatic atmosphere.

In the evening, Qian hosted a dinner in honor of Shevardnadze and his wife, as well as the accompanying delegation.

At the dinner, Qian reviewed the achievements of his visit to the Soviet Union two months ago. He said that although there are still some issues that need further efforts from both sides, significant progress has been made in many areas, and there is a broad consensus on the Cambodian issue. Both sides agree that the relationship between China and the Soviet Union should be based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence to establish a new type of relationship. Both sides believe that the improvement of relations between China and the Soviet Union and the normalization of relations will be beneficial to world peace and stability and will not affect the interests of any other country. He pointed out that no matter how complex the issues are or how short the time is, as long as both sides have goodwill and engage in candid dialogue, they can overcome difficulties and make progress. He emphasized that the world is now eagerly awaiting and closely watching the upcoming high-level meeting between China and the Soviet Union. We should redouble our efforts to continue to move forward based on the achievements we have made. He especially stressed that as two major powers related to the Cambodian issue, China and the Soviet Union should continue to make constructive efforts to resolve the Cambodian issue fairly and reasonably as soon as possible. He hoped that through in-depth exchanges of views, new understandings could be reached on the Cambodian issue, and discussions could be held on the future of bilateral relations and various preparations for the high-level meeting.

Shevardnadze said that the normalization of Soviet-Chinese relations is not only in the interests of the peoples of both countries but will also have a positive impact on the world political climate. We should make Soviet-Chinese relations adapt to the modern world. He said that we should combine the values and interests of all mankind with the common principles of inter-state exchanges and take these principles as the basis for the new type of relationship we are establishing. To this end, the military confrontation between the Soviet Union and China should be reduced to the lowest level acceptable to both sides on a balanced basis; the border issue should be thoroughly resolved; and cooperation in the border areas between the Soviet Union and China should be carried out. He hoped that the two countries would jointly adhere to the principles of respecting independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, equality, and non-interference in internal affairs, and respect each other's interests, views, experiences, and practices. He welcomed the direct contacts between China and Vietnam to resolve the Cambodian issue and was confident that the Soviet-Chinese dialogue would have a positive impact on the resolution of the Cambodian issue.

Attending the dinner were Minister of Metallurgical Industry Qi Yuanjing, Minister of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade Zheng Tuobin, Minister of Culture Wang Meng, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Zhou Guangzhao, and President of the China International Friendship Association Zhang Wenjin.

　　中苏外长举行会谈
    钱其琛宴请谢瓦尔德纳泽
    本报北京２月２日讯  记者周象光报道：今天上午，中国外交部长钱其琛同苏联外交部长谢瓦尔德纳泽在人民大会堂举行了会谈。钱外长说，此次中苏外长会谈是两个月前两国外长在莫斯科会晤的继续，两次对话都是为中苏高级会晤作准备工作的。
    钱外长首先对谢瓦尔德纳泽外长及其一行来华访问表示热烈的欢迎。谢瓦尔德纳泽外长对中方的热情款待表示感谢。他说，此次会谈是一年来他同钱外长的第五次会晤，从讨论的内容来看，这次会谈具有重要的意义。
    在会谈中，两国外长着重讨论了柬埔寨问题。钱外长说，解决柬埔寨问题的形势在发展，目前有关各方就柬埔寨问题进行的各种对话，对早日实现柬埔寨问题的政治解决，至关重要。柬埔寨的内部问题应当由柬埔寨四方在没有外来干涉的情况下自己解决；国际社会应当关心越南撤军后柬埔寨的和平与稳定，并从这一点出发，为柬埔寨内部问题的公正解决作出积极的努力。
    谢瓦尔德纳泽说，最近柬埔寨的形势发生了很多变化，解决柬埔寨问题的进程加快了。他认为，对越南从柬埔寨撤军，落实柬埔寨各方达成的协议和进行自由选举，都要有国际监督，大国要参与保证。他还表示，高棉各方的对话应积极进行。
    两国外长还就双边关系问题，包括中苏边界问题进行了讨论。会谈是在友好、坦诚和求实的气氛中进行的。
    晚上，钱其琛外长举行宴会，欢迎谢瓦尔德纳泽外长和夫人以及随行人员。
    钱外长在宴会上回顾了两个月前他访问苏联所取得的成果。他说，虽然还有一些问题需要双方继续努力，但在不少方面我们已经取得了大体一致的意见，在柬埔寨问题上，谅解的范围扩大了，共同点增加了。我们都同意中苏两国之间应该在和平共处五项原则的基础上建立新型的关系。我们都认为中苏两国改善关系、实现正常化应该有利于世界和平与稳定，而不会影响任何其它国家的利益。事实表明，不管问题多么复杂，时间多么短促，只要双方抱有诚意，坦诚对话，就能克服困难，取得进展。他指出，现在全世界都在期待和关注着将要举行的中苏高级会晤。我们应当加倍努力地工作，争取在已取得的成果的基础上继续前进。他特别强调，中苏作为与柬埔寨问题相关的两个大国，应当继续为早日公正、合理地解决柬埔寨问题作出建设性的努力。他希望通过深入的交换意见，在柬埔寨问题上达成新的谅解，并就两国关系的未来以及有关高级会晤的各项准备工作进行讨论。
    谢瓦尔德纳泽外长说，苏中关系正常化不仅符合我们两国人民的利益，而且对世界政治气候也将产生良好的影响，我们应当使苏中关系适应于现代世界。他说，我们应当把全人类的价值和利益同国与国之间来往的通用原则相结合，并把这些原则作为我们正在建立的新型关系的基础。为此，苏中军事对抗应当在平衡的基础上削减到相互可以接受的最低水平；彻底解决边界问题；开展苏中边境地区的协作。他希望两国共同遵守相互尊重独立、主权、领土完整、平等和互不干涉内政等原则，尊重对方的利益、看法、经验和实践。他欢迎中越两国为解决柬埔寨问题进行的直接接触，并确信，苏中对话对解决柬埔寨问题将产生有利的影响。
    出席宴会的有冶金部长戚元靖、经贸部长郑拓彬、文化部长王蒙、中国科学院院长周光召和对外友协会长章文晋等。
