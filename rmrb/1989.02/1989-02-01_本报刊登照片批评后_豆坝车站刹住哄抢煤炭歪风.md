Editor's Note: The incident of farmers near Doudi Station on the Neijiang-Yibin railway line snatching coal from freight trains has been reported by the station for a year with no response; after the newspaper published photos exposing the issue, the Central Office of the Communist Party of China called for action, and within 10 days, law enforcement agencies took swift action, cutting through the chaos. Those who should be detained were detained, and those who should be fined were fined, immediately deterring the lawbreakers. This case was handled well! It would be even better if action was taken without waiting for newspaper criticism or higher-level intervention.

Currently, incidents of snatching goods from railways still occur frequently. The newspaper cannot publish photos to expose every case, nor can every issue wait for relevant central departments to intervene before being addressed. To stop this trend, the key is for our law enforcement agencies to stand tall and firmly enforce the law without leniency. The true power in our hands is the "law."

According to a report from the People's Daily, on November 10 last year, the newspaper published a news photo on the front page (see attached image), exposing the fact that farmers near Doudi Station on the Neijiang-Yibin railway line were snatching coal with no one to stop them. Recently, the Office of the Communist Party of China in Sichuan Province reported on the handling of this matter to the Central Office of the Communist Party of China.

According to the report, on the same day the People's Daily published the news photo, the General Office of the Central Committee immediately called Sichuan's relevant departments to investigate the matter. With the assistance of the Yibin region and public security agencies, police from the Chongqing Railway Public Security Bureau first went deep into the villages, conducting propaganda and education on protecting state property and voluntarily maintaining the smooth operation of railway transportation. On this basis, on November 20 last year, the leaders of the Railway Public Security Bureau led police to conduct a surprise inspection at Doudi Station and its vicinity, visiting more than 70 households, and identifying 31 people involved in snatching coal as shown in the November 10 photo of the People's Daily. These individuals were given administrative detention and fines, effectively deterring the lawbreakers.

So far, 136 lawbreakers have been identified, 703 people have been caught stealing transported goods, 11,000 kilograms of coal and 3,540 kilograms of fertilizer have been recovered, and 46 people have been legally dealt with, effectively stopping the trend of stealing and snatching.

　　本报刊登照片批评后
    豆坝车站刹住哄抢煤炭歪风
    编者按：豆坝车站附近农民哄抢运煤列车上的煤炭一事，车站呼吁了一年，无人过问；本报刊登照片予以揭露，中共中央办公厅电话催办，１０天之内，执法部门突击整顿，快刀斩乱麻，该拘留的拘留，该罚款的罚款，违法人员立时被震慑。这件事查得好！如果不等报纸批评、上级催办就查则更好！
    眼下，哄抢铁路货物的事仍多有发生，报纸不可能天天登照片披露，也不可能事事都要中央有关部门催办后才去办。要刹住这股歪风，关键是我们的执法部门要挺直腰板，坚决依法办事不手软。我们手中真正有威力的尚方宝剑是“法”。
    本报讯　本报于去年１１月１０日在一版刊登新闻照片（见附图），披露四川内宜铁路线豆坝车站附近农民哄抢煤炭无人管一事。最近，四川省委办公厅就此事查处情况向中共中央办公厅作了汇报。
    据报告介绍，人民日报刊登新闻照片的当天，中办秘书局即电话要求四川有关方面核查此事。在宜宾地区和公安机关协助下，重庆铁路公安分局干警首先深入乡、村，对村民进行爱护国家财产、自觉维护铁路运输畅通的宣传教育。在此基础上，去年１１月２０日，铁路公安分局领导又带领干警，赴豆坝车站附近突击清查，走访７０余户人家，查获人民日报１１月１０日照片上哄抢煤炭人员３１名，并分别给予治安拘留、治安罚款等处理，使违法人员受到震慑。
    到目前为止，已查获不法分子１３６人，偷拿运输物资的７０３人，追回煤炭１１０００公斤，化肥３５４０公斤，依法处理４６人，基本刹住了偷拿、哄抢之风。
