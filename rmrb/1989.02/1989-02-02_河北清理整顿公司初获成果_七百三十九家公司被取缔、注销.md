Hebei Province has made significant progress in cleaning up and rectifying companies according to policy regulations, with simultaneous inspections and handling yielding notable results. As of now, 739 companies have been shut down, had their licenses revoked, or been deregistered; over 1,500 companies have received various forms of punishment.

After investigating and surveying all 13,789 companies in the province, it was found that 584 companies either engaged in illegal operations, speculation, or illegal trading of important production materials and scarce consumer goods; or simply added unnecessary circulation links and had no need to continue operating; or had chaotic management, severe losses, and were unable to repay debts. For example, the Zhangbei County Danchenghe Township Trade Company, with a registered capital of 150,000 yuan, operated for over two years without legitimate business projects and owed 180,000 yuan in external debts, unable to repay. The Shenzhou County Township Enterprise Bureau's Local Resource Development Company misused over 300,000 yuan in loans to illegally trade cars. These companies have all had their business licenses revoked.

Some departments and units established so-called "companies" without licenses, with the sponsoring and managing units only collecting management fees. For instance, the Xingle County Youth Employment Office, under the name of the Materials Bureau, established the Xingle County Materials Trade Company. The Materials Bureau only collected "management fees" without managing funds, premises, or personnel. A total of 110 companies of this type have been lawfully shut down.

Another portion of companies, after obtaining business licenses, were unable to operate and existed in name only. For example, the Lingshou County Automobile Service Company operated for over half a year without operational capabilities. These companies, totaling 45, have had their business licenses confiscated and been deregistered.

　　河北清理整顿公司初获成果
    七百三十九家公司被取缔、注销
    本报讯  河北省按照政策规定清理、整顿公司，边检查、边处理，成效显著。到目前为止，已有７３９家公司被取缔、吊销执照、注销；１５００多家公司受到不同处理。
    经对全省１３７８９家公司调查摸底，结果表明，其中有５８４家公司或违法经营，投机倒把，非法倒卖重要生产资料和紧俏耐用消费品；或纯属增加流通环节，无继续存在的必要；或经营管理混乱，严重亏损，资不低债。如张北县单晶河乡贸易公司注册资金１５万元，开业两年多，无正当经营项目，已欠外债１８万元，无力偿还；深泽县乡镇企业局主办的地方资源开发公司，动用３０多万元贷款，非法倒卖轿车。以上公司全被吊销营业执照。
    有些部门、单位成立的所谓“公司”，无证经营，主办、主管单位只提取管理费。如新乐县待业青年张文海以物资局名义办的新乐县物资贸易公司，物资局只收“管理费用”，不管资金、场地、人员。这类被依法取缔的公司共计１１０家。
    另有一部分公司领取营业执照后，无力经营，名存实亡。如灵寿县汽车服务公司开业半年多，无经营能力。这类被收缴营业执照、予以注销的公司，计有４５家。
