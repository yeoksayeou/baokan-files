Jiangsu Honors Advanced Cities and Counties in Grain and Cotton Production

	The People's Daily, Nanjing, February 21 — Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhou Zhenfeng and People's Daily reporter Gong Yongquan report: At the closing of the Jiangsu Rural Work Conference this afternoon, 26 cities and counties were honored by the provincial Party Committee and government, receiving awards for being advanced in grain and cotton production. Last year, Jiangsu's per capita grain possession remained above 500 kilograms for five consecutive years, and cotton production increased by 26%, earning praise from the Ministry of Agriculture as "standing out alone." These 26 cities and counties are the leaders in grain and cotton production. Xinghua City, located in the Lixiahe area, saw its grain yield increase by 7.5% over the historical high of 1984. Wujin County, known for its thriving township enterprises, has maintained grain production above 750 million kilograms for several years, with a per capita output of 600 kilograms.
