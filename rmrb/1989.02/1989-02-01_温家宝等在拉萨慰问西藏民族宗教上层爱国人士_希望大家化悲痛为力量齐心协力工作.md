Today in the afternoon, Wen Jiabao, a candidate member of the Central Committee Secretariat, Wu Lianyuan, deputy director of the Central Committee's United Front Work Department, Xu Kongran, vice-secretary of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and Hu Jintao, secretary of the Tibet Autonomous Region Party Committee, Ge Daji, deputy secretary, and Duoji Cairang, chairman of the autonomous region, visited and comforted Tibetan ethnic and religious leaders in Lhasa.

Wen Jiabao said to the patriotic leaders present, "This time, I was commissioned by the Central Committee to lead a team of medical experts to rush to Shigatse to rescue Panchen Vice Chairman. On my way back to Beijing, I specially came to Lhasa to visit you all. Here, on behalf of the Central Committee, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the State Council, and representing Comrade Zhao Ziyang and the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau, I extend my warm greetings to you all."

Wen Jiabao introduced with a heavy heart that Panchen Vice Chairman suddenly suffered a heart attack at 4:30 AM on January 28 in Shigatse. The attending doctors and doctors in Shigatse immediately began full-scale rescue efforts. Hu Jintao and other Party and government leaders in Tibet, upon hearing the news, immediately led a medical team to Shigatse. That morning at 9 AM, the Central Committee received the report. Comrade Zhao Ziyang and other members of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau immediately dispatched me, along with Wu Lianyuan, deputy director of the Central Committee's United Front Work Department, and Xu Kongran, vice-secretary of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, to lead a team of experts from Beijing Hospital to rush to Shigatse by special plane to participate in the rescue. Before departure, the Central Committee leaders instructed that as long as there was a glimmer of hope, every effort should be made to rescue him. The expert team and all of us from Beijing felt a great sense of responsibility. With the strong support of the Air Force, we overcame numerous difficulties and traveled continuously, arriving in Shigatse from Beijing in just 7 hours to join the intense rescue efforts. During the rescue of Panchen Master, we took all possible measures and means, and did our utmost. However, due to the severity of Panchen Vice Chairman's acute inferior and extensive anterior wall myocardial infarction, despite our best efforts, there was no sign of improvement, and finally, the rescue was unsuccessful.

Wen Jiabao continued, "Panchen Master was an outstanding statesman, a great patriot, a loyal friend of the Communist Party of China, and an outstanding leader of Tibetan Buddhism. For decades, he has firmly stood for patriotism, resolutely opposed any attempt to split the motherland, and made significant contributions to maintaining national unity and ethnic solidarity. He loves the Party, loves socialist China, and especially since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, he has firmly supported the Party's line, principles, and policies, and supported reform and opening up. He has shown great concern for the social progress of Tibet and the well-being of the Tibetan people, and has made tremendous efforts for this. As an outstanding leader of Tibetan Buddhism, he has deep knowledge in religious studies and is beloved and respected by the broad masses of monks and laypeople. The passing of Panchen Master is a great loss for our country, as we have lost a great patriot and statesman. The Tibetan people have lost an outstanding religious leader. This is a great loss for our country and for all the ethnic groups in the country, including the Tibetan people. We are deeply saddened by the passing of the Master."

Wen Jiabao hoped that everyone would turn their sorrow into strength, carry forward the spirit of Panchen Master's love for the Communist Party of China and socialist China, firmly maintain national unity and ethnic solidarity, set an example for the cadres of all ethnic groups in Tibet and the broad masses of monks and laypeople, complete the unfinished work of Panchen Master, build a united, prosperous, and civilized socialist new Tibet, and work together to commemorate the respected Panchen Master with practical actions.

Wen Jiabao said that the Party and the state, considering the Master's lofty status and his immense influence at home and abroad, have decided to arrange the Master's funeral according to the customs and rituals of Tibetan Buddhism. The Party and the state, as well as the Party Committee and government of the Tibet Autonomous Region, will hold a solemn memorial service for Panchen Master in accordance with the standards for state leaders.

Wen Jiabao also asked everyone to convey his greetings to other patriotic leaders who were not present.

Larim Soglangzhu, vice-chairman of the Tibet Autonomous Region Political Consultative Conference, Jibu Pingcuo Celing, vice-chairman of the autonomous region, and Danqing Jiacuo, vice-chairman of the Tibet Autonomous Region Political Consultative Conference, spoke at the meeting. They expressed deep sorrow over the Master's passing and thanked the Central Committee and the Autonomous Region Party Committee for promptly dispatching personnel to Shigatse to rescue the Master. They believed that the Central Committee's respect for the customs and feelings of Tibetan Buddhism and the broad masses of monks and laypeople, and the handling of the Master's funeral in religious form, showed the Party's care for the Tibetan people. They expressed their determination not to disappoint the Central Committee's care and expectations, to carry on the Master's unfinished work, and to contribute to maintaining national unity, ethnic solidarity, and promoting the prosperity of Tibet.

　　温家宝等在拉萨慰问西藏民族宗教上层爱国人士
    希望大家化悲痛为力量齐心协力工作
    新华社拉萨１月３１日电  （记者皮德义）今天下午，中共中央书记处候补书记温家宝、中共中央统战部副部长武连元，全国人大常委会副秘书长许孔让和西藏自治区党委书记胡锦涛、副书记热地、自治区主席多吉才让，看望、慰问了在拉萨的西藏民族、宗教上层爱国人士。
    温家宝对到场的爱国人士说，我这次受中央委托，率领医疗专家小组赶赴日喀则参加抢救班禅副委员长。在返京途中，特意来拉萨看望大家。在这里，我代表党中央、全国人大常委会、国务院、代表赵紫阳同志和中央政治局常委，向在座的各位表示亲切的慰问。
    温家宝怀着沉重的心情介绍说，班禅副委员长是在日喀则期间于１月２８日凌晨４时３０分突发心肌梗塞，随行医生和日喀则的医生立即进行全力抢救。胡锦涛等西藏自治区党政军领导同志，闻讯后即刻率领医疗小组奔赴日喀则。当天上午９时，中央得到报告，赵紫阳同志和中央政治局其他常委，当即指派我和中央统战部武连元副部长、全国人大常委会许孔让副秘书长一起，率领北京医院专家小组乘专机火速赶赴日喀则参加抢救。临行前，中央领导同志叮嘱，只要有一线希望，就要尽全力抢救。专家小组和我们从北京来的所有同志，深感责任重大。在空军的大力支持下，我们克服重重困难，连续兼程，仅用７个小时，就由北京赶抵日喀则，投入紧张的抢救工作。在抢救班禅大师的过程中，我们采取了一切措施和手段，尽了最大的努力。但由于班禅副委员长患的是急性下壁、广泛前壁心肌梗塞，病情过于严重，虽经多方努力，未见丝毫转机，终于抢救无效。
    温家宝接着说，班禅大师是杰出的国务活动家，是伟大的爱国主义者，是中国共产党的忠诚朋友，是中国藏传佛教的杰出领袖。几十年来，他旗帜鲜明地坚持爱国主义立场，坚决反对任何分裂祖国的行径，为维护祖国统一、民族团结作出了重大贡献。他热爱党、热爱社会主义祖国，特别是党的十一届三中全会以来，他坚决拥护党的路线、方针和政策，拥护改革、开放。他十分关心西藏的社会进步和广大藏族人民的生活幸福，并为此做出了极大的努力。作为藏传佛教的杰出领袖，他在宗教学识上具有很深的造诣，受到广大僧俗群众的拥护和爱戴。班禅大师的圆寂，使我们国家失去了一位伟大的爱国主义者和国务活动家，广大藏族人民失去了一位杰出的爱国宗教领袖，这是我们国家的一个重大损失，是包括藏族人民在内的全国各族人民的一个重大损失。对于大师的圆寂，我们极感悲痛。
    温家宝希望大家化悲痛为力量，发扬班禅大师热爱中国共产党、热爱社会主义祖国的精神，坚定地维护祖国统一、民族团结，为西藏各族干部和广大僧俗群众作出表率，为完成班禅大师的未竟事业，建设团结、富裕、文明的社会主义新西藏，齐心协力工作，以实际行动纪念尊敬的班禅大师。
    温家宝说党和国家考虑到班禅大师的崇高地位和在国内外的巨大影响，已经作出决定，按照藏传佛教的习俗和仪规，妥善安排班禅大师的后事。党和国家及西藏自治区党委、政府将按国家领导人规格为班禅大师举行隆重的追悼会。
    温家宝还请大家向没有到场的其他爱国人士问好。
    自治区政协副主席拉敏·索朗伦珠、自治区副主席吉普·平措次登和自治区政协副主席丹增嘉措在会见时发了言。他们对大师的逝世表示沉痛的哀悼，对党中央和自治区党委及时地派人赶赴日喀则抢救大师表示感谢。他们认为，中央能够尊重藏传佛教的习俗和广大僧俗的情感，以宗教形式办理大师后事，体现了党对藏族人民的关怀。他们表示，一定要不辜负中央的关怀和希望，继承大师的未竟事业，为维护祖国统一、民族团结和促进西藏的繁荣做出贡献。
