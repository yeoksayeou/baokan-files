The first national key men's volleyball winter training camp began on February 13 in the Chenzhou volleyball training base. On the morning of the 12th, the training hall was filled with the sounds of balls and shouts, creating a lively and tense training atmosphere. The Beijing team, which arrived early, was the first to start training. Teams from Tianjin, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong, Hubei, Sichuan, and the PLA will also arrive in the coming days to this "home of volleyball."

To improve the training level of men's volleyball teams nationwide and to provide high-quality reserves for the national team, the State Sports Commission decided to concentrate the national key men's volleyball teams for winter training from February 13 to April 3 in Chenzhou. The State Sports Commission also selected a group of key coaches and researchers from various regions to form a winter training guidance team, including Wang Zuhong, Hu Guangli, Liu Xiangyi, Xu Zhen, Ji Erxuan, and Sun Taihua. Leaders from the Hunan Provincial Sports Commission and the Chenzhou municipal government attach great importance to and care about this winter training. They proposed to use the same attitude and enthusiasm as when they hosted the Chinese women's volleyball team to ensure the logistics work for this training.

　　全国重点男排在郴州集训
    本报讯  第一次举办的全国重点男排冬训二月十三日在郴州排球训练基地开始。十二日上午，训练馆里传出阵阵球声、呼喊声，呈现着热闹而紧张的训练气氛。提前报到的北京队最先投入训练。天津、江苏、浙江、山东、湖北、四川、八一等队也将于日内抵达这个“排球之家”。
    为了提高全国男排队伍的训练水平，为国家队输送高质量的后备人才，国家体委决定集中全国重点男排于二月十三日至四月三日在郴州冬训。国家体委还从各地抽调了一批骨干教练、科研人员组成冬训指导小组，包括王祖洪、胡广礼、刘向翊、徐真、计尔煊、孙太华等。湖南省体委和郴州地、市领导同志十分重视和关心这次冬训，他们提出要用当年接待中国女排的态度和干劲搞好这次训练的后勤工作。
