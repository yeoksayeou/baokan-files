The western and northern ethnic regions of China will implement a "dual opening" strategy. One aspect will involve opening up to the coastal regions and developed countries to the east and south, while the other will involve opening up to neighboring countries and nearby regions to the west and north.

According to the Xinhua News Agency, the concept of "dual opening" for China's western and northern ethnic regions has been submitted to the central government by the State Ethnic Affairs Commission and has received the approval of some high-level leaders in the central government.

State Ethnic Affairs Commission Vice Chairman Zhao Yanni revealed this concept at a meeting held in Beijing today.

He said that the opening of inland border regions involves three main aspects: general border trade points and transit points; key cities for trade and economic and technological exchanges with neighboring countries and their adjacent regions; and important ports for railways, highways, and waterways to third countries and beyond.

The State Ethnic Affairs Commission's proposal for opening up to the west and north requires starting from the actual situation of land border ethnic regions and referring to the policies and practices of coastal open regions.

Due to the central government's implementation of the coastal economic development strategy, ethnic minority regions in western and northern China have felt significant pressure. Information from the State Ethnic Affairs Commission indicates that the economic gap between the eastern and western regions continued to widen last year. The "dual opening" concept proposed by relevant parties aims to accelerate the economic development of ethnic minority regions and to narrow the existing economic gap between the eastern and western regions of China as much as possible.

A high-level official from the State Ethnic Affairs Commission believes that for most ethnic regions, opening up to the west and north can transform remote areas into frontiers, changing the disadvantage of being far from the domestic market into the advantage of being close to the international market.

Zhao Yanni said that the implementation of this concept can strongly promote changes in the industrial and product structures of ethnic minority regions, promote the development of commodity economies, and change people's mentalities.

It is reported that the specific plan for this concept is expected to be released soon. Cities such as Manzhouli and Erlian in Inner Mongolia, Kashgar and Yili in Xinjiang, Yadong in Tibet, Dehong and Xishuangbanna in Yunnan, and Yanbian in Jilin are likely to become the leading regions for implementing the "dual opening" strategy in China's western and northern ethnic regions.

### 发展少数民族经济新构想  西北地区将双向开放  一向沿海海外　一向内陆邻国

　　发展少数民族经济新构想
    西北地区将双向开放
    一向沿海海外　一向内陆邻国
    据中新社北京２月２０日电  （记者伟翔）中国西部、北部民族地区将实行“双向开放”，一是向东向南对沿海及发达国家开放，二是向西向北对邻国及相近国家开放。
    据称，中国西部、北部民族地区“双向开放”的构想已经由国家民委上报中央，并得到了中央一些高级领导人的赞赏。
    国家民委副主任赵延年今天在此间的一个会议上披露了这一构想。
    他说，内陆边境的对外开放，一是一般的边境贸易点、过货点；二是对邻国及该国相邻地区的重点贸易及经济技术交流合作的城市；三是可以通过向第三国乃至更大范围的铁路、公路、水路的重要口岸。
    国家民委提出的这一构想要求，向西向北开放，应从陆地边境民族地区的实际情况出发，参考沿海开放地区的政策和作法。
    由于中央实施沿海经济发展战略，位于中国西部、北部的少数民族地区感受到较大的压力。来自国家民委的消息说，去年东西部之间的经济差距仍在拉大。此番有关方面提出的“双向开放”构想，意在加速少数民族地区经济的发展，尽可能地缩小中国东西部之间现已存在的经济差距。
    国家民委的一位高级官员认为，对于大多数民族地区来说，通过向西向北开放，能够由偏远变为前哨，由远离国内市场的劣势变为就近进入国际市场的优势。
    赵延年说，这一构想的实施，可以有力地促进少数民族地区的产业结构产品结构的变化，促进商品经济的发展和人们精神面貌的改变。
    据悉，这一构想的具体方案近日可望出台，内蒙古的满洲里和二连、新疆的喀什和伊犁、西藏的亚东、云南的德宏和西双版纳、吉林的延边等都极有可能成为中国西部、北部民族地区实行“双向开放”的先头地域。
