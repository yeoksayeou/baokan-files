India attaches great importance to the development of science and technology in the face of the severe situation of future comprehensive national strength competition. Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi has repeatedly stated that India will use science and technology to bring India into the 21st century. India's goal is to become one of the world's leading scientific and technological powers by the 21st century.

To achieve this goal, the Indian government has implemented a series of measures.

Developing education and cultivating scientific and technological talents is one of the key measures. India regards the development of education as a crucial factor in achieving modernization and has always placed a high priority on education development, particularly higher education. A series of policies, objectives, and plans have been formulated to increase funding for education. According to reports, during the first Five-Year Plan, India's higher education expenditure was 140 million rupees, while during the sixth Five-Year Plan, it increased to 486 million rupees, a growth of 33.7 times. These funds are mainly used for school infrastructure and the purchase of equipment and instruments. These measures have greatly promoted the rapid development of education. Currently, the number of primary school students in India is three times higher than before independence, and the number of university students has increased fourfold. The number of scientific and technological personnel with bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees has increased by more than tenfold. Before independence, India had only 18 universities, but by 1985, this number had increased to 135. Simultaneously, the number of various colleges has increased from 636 to 5,000. The number of university students before independence was only 225,000, but by 1985, it had increased to 3.442 million. According to reports, India has now established a series of scientific and technological research institutions, with nearly 3 million scientific and technological talents, second only to the United States and the Soviet Union, ranking third in the world.

While vigorously cultivating talents, India has also formulated a blueprint for the development of science and technology. In 1985, the draft of the Seventh Science and Technology Plan was adopted, emphasizing the concentration of efforts on the development of strategically significant technologies and formulating a medium- and long-term development plan for the end of this century. To strengthen the leadership of scientific and technological work, the Prime Minister's Scientific Advisory Committee, a think tank for the development of science and technology, was established. In 1987, when the world witnessed a high-temperature superconductivity research boom, India established a high-level leadership body for superconductivity research chaired by Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, responsible for the leadership and coordination of this scientific research. To encourage scientific and technological progress, an annual science and technology award is given, and the President, Vice President, or Prime Minister personally presents the awards to the winners. To ensure the smooth progress of scientific and technological work, the government increases funding for the development of science and technology every year. According to reports, the total research funding for the 1984-1985 fiscal year alone reached 1.891 billion rupees. In the Seventh Five-Year Plan, the investment totaled nearly 1% of the national gross domestic product. It is expected that by the year 2000, this proportion will be increased to 3%. In the 1988-1989 fiscal year, the total budget for science and technology was 17 billion rupees, an increase of 20% over the previous year. India now spends approximately $115 million annually on research and development.

Due to the implementation of the above measures, India's science and technology have developed rapidly and achieved remarkable results. India has made significant progress in space, nuclear energy, agriculture, and defense research. In 1983, India successfully launched the "Rohini-D-2" and "Indian Satellite-IB" satellites using its own rockets, marking a new stage in India's aerospace technology. To date, India has launched 11 satellites, which are widely used in communications, weather forecasting, resource exploration, and various sectors of the national economy. India has initially formed an independent aerospace industry system and has a team of 15,000 aerospace scientists and technicians. According to the Indian magazine "Veer," if the SLV-3 rocket made by India is slightly modified, it can become a medium-range ballistic missile. It is expected that the third-generation rocket to be launched in the future will be able to send a 1,000-kilogram telemetry satellite into an 800-kilometer orbit. The fourth-generation rocket that India plans to develop can launch geostationary satellites. If these rockets are successfully developed, it will indicate that India has the capability to launch long-range ballistic missiles. Experts estimate that by the end of the 1990s to the beginning of the next century, India will have the capability to launch space shuttles.

In the field of high-temperature superconductivity research, India has entered the ranks of advanced countries. In agricultural science research, India has cultivated many excellent crop varieties. For example, the successful development of high-yield wheat varieties has increased wheat production by seven times, and new varieties of bamboo, grapes, and several legumes have been cultivated in test tubes. The development of agricultural science and technology has greatly improved the agricultural landscape. In normal years, India's annual grain production has reached 150 million tons, basically achieving self-sufficiency and having a slight surplus. In the field of new materials, India's first experimental carbon fiber factory has been put into production, making India one of the few countries in the world that can produce this key material widely used in aerospace, aviation, and national defense. In the field of defense research, India has designed and manufactured wireless detonators for bomb warheads and developed an advanced material used to cover missile warheads. This material can withstand the high temperatures generated by high-speed flight. In addition, India has successfully developed a medium-range air defense weapon system.

In the development of nuclear technology, India has established 6 nuclear research institutions and a complete nuclear industry system from exploration, mining, smelting, purification, recycling, and waste treatment. India currently has 6 nuclear reactors with a total installed capacity of 1,154 megawatts. India's nuclear industry can provide 90% of the domestically produced equipment for power plants. According to reports, by the end of this century, India plans to increase the total installed capacity of nuclear power plants to 10 million kilowatts, accounting for 10% of the country's total electricity generation at that time.

　　印度重视发展科学技术
    归通昌
    面临未来综合国力竞争的严峻形势，印度政府十分重视发展科学技术。拉·甘地总理多次表示，要用科学技术把印度带入２１世纪。印度的奋斗目标是：在２１世纪跻身于世界科技大国的行列。
    为了实现上述目标，印度政府制定了许多措施。
    发展教育，培养科技人才是重要措施之一。印度把发展教育视为实现现代化的关键因素，始终把发展教育放在重要的位置上，制定了发展教育，特别是发展高等教育的一系列方针、政策、目标和规划，不断增加对教育的资金投入。据报道，第一个五年计划期间，印度高等教育经费为１．４亿卢比，而第六个五年计划期间则增加到４８．６亿卢比，增长了３３．７倍。这些资金主要用于学校的基本设施和购买仪器设备。这些措施有力地推动教育的迅速发展。目前，印度小学的学生人数比独立前增加了３倍，大学的学生人数增加了４倍。具有学士、硕士和博士学位的科技人员增加了十几倍。独立前，印度的大学只有１８所，１９８５年已增加到１３５所，同时，各类学院也从６３６所增加到５０００所。高校学生独立前只有２２．５万人，１９８５年已增加到３４４．２万人。据报道，目前印度已建立了一系列科学技术研究机构，各类科技人才近３００万，仅次于美国和苏联，居世界第３位。
    在大力培养人才的同时，印度还制定了发展科技计划的纲要，１９８５年通过了第７个科技计划草案，强调集中力量发展具有战略意义的技术，并制订了一项至本世纪末的中长期发展规划。为加强对科技工作的领导，还成立了发展科技的智囊机构——总理科学顾问委员会。１９８７年世界出现高温超导研究热潮时，印度还成立了由拉·甘地总理任主席的内阁超导研究的最高领导机构，负责对该项科研的领导和协调工作。为鼓励科技进步，每年评选一次科技大奖，并由总统、副总统或总理亲自向获奖者颁奖。为保证科技工作的顺利进行，政府每年都增加对发展科技的资金投入。据报道，仅１９８４—１９８５年度科研经费总额就达到１８．９１亿卢比。在第七个五年计划的投资总额接近国民生产总值的１％。预计到２０００年，将把这一比例提高３％。１９８８—１９８９年度，科技预算的总额为１７０亿卢比，比上一年度增长了２０％。印度现在每年在科研和发展方面的花费大约１．１５亿美元。
    由于采取了上述种种措施，印度的科学技术得到了迅速发展，取得了可喜的成果。印度在空间、核能、农业和防务研究方面均取得了进展。１９８３年，印度用自制火箭先后成功地发射了“光明—Ｄ—２”号和“印度卫星—ＩＢ”卫星，这标志着印度航天技术已发展到了一个新的阶段。迄今，印度已发射了１１颗卫星，并已广泛应用于通讯、天气预报、资源勘探等国民经济的各个领域。印度已初步形成了本国独立的航天工业体系，并拥有一支１５０００人的航天科技队伍。据印度《勇士》月刊透露，如果将印度自制的ＳＬＶ—３火箭稍加改装，就可成为中程弹道导弹。预计今后进行发射试验的第三代火箭，可将１０００公斤的遥测卫星送入８００公里高的轨道。印度计划研制的第四代火箭可发射同步卫星，这些火箭如能研制成功，将表明印度具备发射远程弹道导弹的能力。据专家估计，在９０年代末到下个世纪初，印度将具有发射航天飞机的能力。
    在高温超导研究方面，印度已跨入先进国家的行列。在农业科学研究方面，印度已培养出许多优良农作物品种。如高产小麦品种的研制成功，使小麦产量增加了７倍，并在试管里培育出了竹、葡萄和几种豆类的新品种。农业科技的发展，使农业面貌大为改观，在正常的年景下，印度粮食年产量已达到１．５亿吨，基本实现自给，并略有节余。在新材料领域，印度第一家碳纤维试验性工厂已投产，使印度成为世界上少数能生产这种广泛用于航天、航空和国防的关键性材料的国家之一。在国防科研方面，已设计和制造了用于引爆弹头的无线电引信，还研制成了一种用于覆盖导弹弹头的先进材料，这种材料能耐高速飞行产生的高温。此外，还研制成功了中程地对空武器系统。
    在发展核技术方面，印度已建立了６个核研究机构，并建立了从勘探、开采、冶炼、提纯回收和废料处理等一套完整的核工业体系。印度现有核反应堆６座，总装机容量为１１５４兆瓦。印度的核工业已能为电站提供９０％的国产设备。据报道，到本世纪末，印度准备使核电站总装机容量达到１０００万千瓦，相当于那时印度全国发电量的１０％。
