	The Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources and the State Ethnic Affairs Commission have jointly decided to help 141 key ethnic minority poor counties develop mining. According to a report by reporter Zou Dayi, within the next two to three years, these counties are expected to each have at least one medium or small mine that is suitable for local development and has high economic benefits.

	The Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources and the State Ethnic Affairs Commission recently issued a joint notice for the first time to promote the economic and cultural development of ethnic minority regions. The notice requires geology and mineral resources departments and local ethnic affairs commissions to help ethnic minorities and ethnic minority regions accelerate the development and utilization of geological and mineral resources, transforming these regions' resource advantages into economic advantages.

	In the future, the Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources will regularly provide reliable geological data, mineral resource bases, and technical verification reports for the land development, treatment, construction planning, and macroeconomic decision-making of ethnic minority regions. At the same time, it will carry out agricultural geological work for ethnic minority regions, explore underground water sources for severely drought-stricken and water-scarce ethnic minority regions, actively support the mining and mineral product processing by the people of ethnic minority regions, and promote technological poverty alleviation.

    本报讯  记者邹大毅报道：今后两三年内，全国１４１个重点扶持的少数民族贫困县可望平均有一个适合于当地开采的、经济效益高的中、小矿。
    地质矿产部和国家民族事务委员会最近首次就促进少数民族地区经济文化的发展联合发出通知，要求地矿部门和各地民委帮助少数民族和少数民族地区加快地质矿产资源的开发利用，将这些地区的资源优势转化为经济优势。
    地矿部门今后将定期为少数民族地区的国土开发和整治、建设规划和宏观经济决策提供可靠的地质资料、矿产资源依据和技术论证报告。同时，还将为少数民族地区开展农业地质工作，为严重干旱缺水的少数民族地区勘察地下水源，积极扶持少数民族地区人民办矿和矿产品加工以及开展科技扶贫。
