The Shenyang City Shenghe District government recently held a grand awards ceremony to present certificates and monetary awards to 34 soldiers from the district who have been honored for their military achievements. This is to encourage them to serve diligently, dedicate themselves to national defense, and make greater contributions to the construction of the military.

The Shenghe District civil affairs department implements a "recruitment, service, and retirement" comprehensive management system for soldiers from the district. Not only does it ensure that qualified youth are sent to the military, but it also assists the military in conducting political and ideological work. Additionally, based on the soldiers' performance in the military, different arrangements are made for them upon retirement. To further improve these measures, the district government decided last July to allocate special funds from the district's financial budget to establish the "Excellent Active-Duty Soldier Award Fund." This fund rewards outstanding officers and soldiers who have been recruited from the district and have achieved remarkable results and been honored for their military achievements.

According to statistics, over 3,000 soldiers from Shenghe District are currently serving in the military. In recent years, 234 of them have been honored for their achievements. All those who have been honored have received awards from the Shenghe District government. The 34 individuals invited back to their hometown to receive awards this time are outstanding representatives among them.

　　沈阳市沈河区政府设立“优秀现役军人奖励基金”
    新华社沈阳１月３１日电  （通讯员刘铁夫、记者黄明松）沈阳市沈河区政府日前隆重举行庆功奖励大会，为从本区入伍、在部队荣立军功的３４名解放军官兵颁发奖状和奖金，鼓舞他们安心服役，献身国防，为部队建设做出更大贡献。
    沈河区民政部门对从本区入伍的战士实行“征、役、退”一条龙管理办法。不仅保证把好青年送到部队，而且协助部队做好思想政治工作，并根据战士在部队的表现，退役时给予不同安置。为了使这些措施进一步完善，区政府于去年７月又作出决定，从区财政经费中拨出专款，设立“优秀现役军人奖励基金”，奖励从本区应征入伍，在部队成绩突出、荣立军功的干部战士。据统计，沈河区在部队服役的３０００多名现役军人，近年来有２３４人立功。凡立功者都受到了沈河区政府的奖励。这次被邀请回乡接受奖励的３４人，是他们当中的优秀代表。
