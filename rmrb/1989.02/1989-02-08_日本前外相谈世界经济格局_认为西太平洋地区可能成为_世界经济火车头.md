Former Japanese Foreign Minister Discusses Global Economic Landscape
Believes the Western Pacific Region May Become the "Engine of the World Economy"

	PARIS, Feb. 7 (Xinhua) -- Former Japanese Foreign Minister Saburo Okita said on February 6 in Paris that the Western Pacific region has the potential to become the "engine of the world economy" in the 1990s.

	Okita made these remarks at the opening ceremony of an international symposium marking the 25th anniversary of the establishment of the Development Center of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). According to Agence France-Presse, Okita said that the rapidly developing East Asian region may soon "match North America and Europe economically."

	The former Japanese foreign minister noted that the globalization of the international economy, driven by new technologies, is accompanied by the strengthening of regional trends. He pointed out that the European Community's move towards an internal unified market and the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement are evidence of this trend. He suggested that "inward-looking regionalization" may force East Asian countries and regions to strengthen their ties.

	Approximately 140 high-level officials, economists, and representatives from the banking and industrial sectors from developed and developing countries participated in this international symposium. The symposium, which began on February 6, will last for three days.

　　日本前外相谈世界经济格局
　　认为西太平洋地区可能成为“世界经济火车头”
    新华社北京２月７日电  巴黎消息：日本前外务大臣大来佐武郎６日在巴黎发表讲话认为，西太平洋地区在本世纪９０年代有可能成为“世界经济的火车头”。
    大来是在由经济合作与发展组织举办的纪念该组织发展中心成立２５周年的国际研讨会开幕式上发表这一见解的。据法新社援引大来的话说，经济发展迅速的东亚地区有可能“不久在经济上与北美和欧洲相匹敌”。
    这位日本前外相说，由新技术引起的国际经济全球化是伴随着“地区化”趋势的加强出现的，欧洲共同体走向内部统一大市场和美加自由贸易协定即证明了这一趋势。他指出，可以设想，“内向的地区化”会迫使东亚国家和地区也加强它们之间的联系。
    参加这次国际研讨会的有来自发达国家和发展中国家约１４０名高级官员、经济学家及银行界和工业界人士。研讨会于６日开幕，为期３天。
