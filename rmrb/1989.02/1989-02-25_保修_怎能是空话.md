Title: How Can "Warranty" Be Just Empty Words

Last May, I spent 1,600 yuan to buy a Xilin brand refrigerator. After using it for less than two months, it broke down. I went to the Xilin refrigerator warranty service point in our city, and they promised to come to my home for service in a couple of days. I was quite pleased. More than five months have passed, and I have gone to find them seven times. Each time, they use the phrase "service at your home in a couple of days" to put me off. To this day, the repair personnel have not come to my home. I planned to send the refrigerator to this warranty service point for repair, but when I saw the dozens of refrigerators awaiting repair inside the service point, all covered in thick dust, I hesitated.

I hope the relevant departments will investigate how the Xilin refrigerator warranty service point in our city is handling warranty work.

### “保修”怎能是空话

　　“保修”怎能是空话
    去年５月，我花１６００元买了一台西泠牌电冰箱，用了不到两个月就坏了。我找到本市西泠牌冰箱保修点，他们答应过两天上门服务，我挺高兴。５个多月过去了，我先后７次去找他们，他们每次都用“过两天上门服务”这句话来搪塞我，至今维修人员仍未上门来。我打算把冰箱送到这家保修点修理，可当我看到保修点里放着的几十台待修理的冰箱上落满了很厚的灰尘时，又退缩了。
    希望有关部门查一查，我市西泠牌冰箱保修点是怎样做保修工作的。
