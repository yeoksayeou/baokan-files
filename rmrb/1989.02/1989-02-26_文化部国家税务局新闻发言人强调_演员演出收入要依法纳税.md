Cultural Department spokesperson Gao Yunjia and State Taxation Bureau spokesperson Guan Yongning recently spoke on issues related to the management of artistic performances, emphasizing that actors' performance income must be taxed according to law.

The spokespersons said that in recent years, some singers, actors, and dancers with significant influence nationwide have participated in performances organized by various localities, playing a positive role in enriching the cultural lives of the masses. However, some problems have emerged that warrant attention. Some performances violate national regulations or have low artistic standards. Notably, a significant number of actors, after earning high incomes, fail to pay taxes in accordance with the law, resulting in serious tax evasion and underreporting.

The spokespersons said that the taxation of actors' income has been clearly regulated by the state since September 1986. The regulations specify the tax items and chapters for actors' performance earnings, implementing two collection methods: source deduction by the paying unit and self-declaration by the taxpayer. All departments, units, and individual actors must comply with these regulations. However, investigations have shown that some places have not enforced these regulations well.

The spokespersons pointed out that high-quality performances can have higher ticket prices, and famous actors can earn more than ordinary actors. However, it is essential to pay taxes according to the law. Currently, some actors use various methods to evade taxes, even resisting tax authorities' inspections, which has had a negative impact on society. Therefore, the Cultural Department and the State Taxation Bureau reiterate: For individuals who have not declared and paid taxes on performance income earned since 1987, they must voluntarily go to the local tax authorities to pay the outstanding taxes. Paying units that have not deducted or under-deducted taxes must be responsible for recovering the taxes, and if they cannot recover them, they must pay the taxes themselves. All levels of tax authorities must strengthen tax collection management and strictly enforce the law to investigate and punish taxpayers who engage in tax evasion and underreporting.

　　文化部国家税务局新闻发言人强调
    演员演出收入要依法纳税
    新华社北京２月２５日电  文化部新闻发言人高运甲、国家税务局新闻发言人关永宁最近就文艺演出管理等问题发表谈话，强调演员演出收入要依法纳税。
    发言人说，近几年来，一些在全国有一定影响的歌星、影星和舞蹈、曲艺演员参加各地的组台演出，对活跃群众文化生活起到了积极作用，但也出现了一些值得重视的问题。有的组台演出违反国家规定或演出水平不高，特别有相当一部分演员获得高收入后不依法纳税，偷税、漏税现象十分严重。
    发言人说，对演员获得收入的征税等问题，国家１９８６年９月就有明文规定。明确规定了演员演出取得劳务报酬的税目和税章，实行由支付单位源泉扣缴和纳税人自行申报纳税两种征收办法。各部门、各单位及演员个人都应遵照执行。但据调查，有些地方执行得很不好。
    发言人指出，对于高质量的演出，票价可以高些，名演员的收入也可以高于一般演员。但是，必须要依法纳税。目前，有些演员采取多种手法偷税漏税，甚至对抗税务机关的检查，在社会上造成了很坏的影响。为此，文化部、国家税务局重申：凡１９８７年以来个人取得演出收入未申报纳税的，要主动到当地税务机关补缴税款；扣缴义务人未扣或少扣应缴税款的，要负责追缴，追缴不回的要负责补缴税款。各级税务机关要切实强化征税管理工作，依法严肃查处有偷税、漏税行为的纳税义务人。
