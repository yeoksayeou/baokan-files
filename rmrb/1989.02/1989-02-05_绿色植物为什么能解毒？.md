Green plants are natural "sanitation and epidemic prevention disinfection stations." But why can they detoxify?

It turns out that green plants contain many enzymes, which are catalysts with the potential to detoxify. Organic pollutants that seep into the plant can be altered by enzymes, reducing their toxicity. The air contains many pathogenic bacteria. According to a survey, in the air of every shop in a bustling area, there are 4 million bacteria per cubic meter. However, green plants such as camphor trees, yellow wood, pine trees, elm trees, and junipers can secrete a volatile plant bactericide that kills bacteria in the air. One hectare of cypress forest can secrete 60 kilograms of bactericide in one day, which can kill pathogens such as diphtheria, tuberculosis, and dysentery. Pyridine is a carcinogenic organic compound found in coking wastewater, and green plants can also decompose it. Through their detoxifying actions, plants can purify the air, soil, and irrigation water containing phenols and cyanide toxins, greatly benefiting humanity.

Of course, the detoxifying ability of plants is limited. If the amount of pollutants released exceeds the plants' purification capacity, the plants will be harmed, and the environment will be polluted.

### 绿色植物为什么能解毒？

　　绿色植物为什么能解毒？
    绿色植物是天然的“卫生防疫消毒站”。那么，它们为什么能解毒呢？
    原来，绿色植物体内有许多叫作酶的催化剂，具有潜在的解毒能力。有机污染物渗入植物体后，可被酶改变原来面貌而毒性减轻。空气中有许多致病的细菌，据调查，闹市区每家商店内每立方米空气中含有４００万个病菌，而绿色植物如香樟、黄连木、松树、榆树、侧柏等，能分泌出一种挥发性的植物杀菌素，杀死空气中的细菌。一公顷桧柏林一日内能分泌出的杀菌素多达６０千克，可杀死白喉、肺结核、痢疾等病原体。吡啶是一种致癌的有机化合物，存在于焦化污水中，绿色植物也能分解它。植物通过解毒作用可以净化空气、净化土壤和合理灌溉水中酚、氰类有毒物质，使人类深受其益。
    当然，植物的解毒能力是有一定的限度的，如果排放的污染物超过了植物的净化能力，植物就会受到危害，环境随之遭受污染。
