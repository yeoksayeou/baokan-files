Wang Bingqian, a State Councilor and Minister of Finance, visited the Chawei Road Tax Bureau in Haidian District, Beijing, this afternoon to meet with tax officials working on the front lines and to extend holiday greetings.

After listening to the bureau's report, Wang Bingqian said that in 1988, the tax collection work achieved outstanding results, exceeding the annual industrial and commercial tax collection target by 4.2 billion yuan. This success is the result of the joint efforts of the national tax departments, with the support and cooperation of governments and relevant departments at all levels, and the hard work of the broad masses of tax officials. For this, he, on behalf of the State Council, expressed his gratitude to the 500,000 tax officials nationwide.

Wang Bingqian had a cordial conversation with the bureau's staff, encouraging them to strive for greater achievements.
