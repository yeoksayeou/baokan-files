	Corpses Become Bargaining Chips; Hospitals Struggle
	Beijing Hospitals Face Overflowing Mortuaries

		Reports indicate that many hospitals in Beijing are currently facing severe overcrowding in their mortuaries. Some family members of the deceased are using the bodies of their loved ones as "bargaining chips" to engage in prolonged negotiations with the deceased's former work units, causing significant difficulties for the hospitals.

		According to Beijing Union Medical College Hospital, the hospital has clear regulations regarding the storage period for corpses in the mortuary. However, the only bodies that are cremated on time are those of foreigners and peasants. The most troublesome cases involve families of individuals who died from work-related injuries or traffic accidents and refuse to accept decisions made by relevant authorities. They often present unacceptable conditions to the relevant units. Even some families of individuals who died from natural causes take advantage of the situation to create trouble. Recently, a cadre from a certain arts troupe in Beijing died from a cerebral hemorrhage. The family insisted on conditions such as "solving the housing problem for two units and allowing the deceased's child to inherit the position." The corpse remained in the mortuary for several months. The hospital's refrigerators are already insufficient, and due to some families' prolonged disputes with relevant units, the refrigerators cannot be turned over efficiently. Some corpses have to be stored outside the refrigerators, causing environmental pollution.

		It is understood that some corpses in the mortuary of Beijing Friendship Hospital have been stored for as long as five years. A woman who died from natural causes had her family engage in a five-year-long negotiation over economic compensation with the deceased's former work unit, resulting in the corpse rotting and deteriorating. The hospital had to forcibly cremate the body, but the family has not yet come to the hospital to collect the ashes. Military hospitals are no exception. Last year, the General Hospital of the Beijing Military Region stored over 500 corpses in the mortuary, with one-fifth of them stored for more than two months.

		According to regulations, storing a corpse in the mortuary for eight months requires a fee of 2,400 yuan, and for one year, 5,400 yuan. Long-term storage of corpses not only imposes a heavy economic burden on relevant units but also consumes a large amount of manpower and time. Currently, the phenomenon of "using the dead to pressure the living" is becoming increasingly severe. Medical professionals are calling on relevant authorities to take effective measures to stop the spread of this detrimental practice.

### 遗体竟成筹码　医院叫苦不迭  北京一些医院太平间尸满为患

　　遗体竟成筹码　医院叫苦不迭
    北京一些医院太平间尸满为患
    本报讯  如今北京许多医院太平间尸满为患。一些死者家属用亲人的尸体作“筹码”，与死者原单位进行旷日持久的讨价还价，医院为此叫苦不迭。
    据北京协和医院介绍，医院太平间停放尸体期限本有明确规定，但在这里按期火化遗体的，一是外国人，二是农民。最棘手的是那些因工伤或交通事故死亡者的家属不服从有关部门裁决，而对有关单位提出难以接受的条件。个别正常死亡者的家属，也乘机胡搅蛮缠。前不久，北京某文艺团体一位干部患脑溢血死亡，其家属硬是向死者原所在单位提出“解决两套住房、让死者的孩子接班”等条件。死者遗体在太平间一放就是几个月。协和医院存放尸体的冰柜本来就不充裕，由于一些死者家属长期同有关单位“打官司”，冰柜周转不灵，一些尸体不得不存放于冰柜之外，造成环境污染。
    据了解，北京同仁医院太平间的尸体有的已存放５年。一位妇女本属正常死亡，其家属同死者原所在单位进行长达５年的“经济赔偿”谈判，导致尸体腐烂变质，医院不得不强行火化，但死者家属至今没来医院领取骨灰。军内医院也不例外。北京军区总医院去年在太平间存放过５００多具尸体，其中超过两个月的占１／５。
    按规定，尸体在太平间存放８个月交停尸费２４００元，存放一年交５４００元。长期存放尸体，不仅给有关单位带来沉重的经济负担，而且要耗费大量精力和时间。目前，“用死人压活人”现象日趋严重，医务界人士呼吁有关领导部门切实制止这种不良现象的蔓延。
