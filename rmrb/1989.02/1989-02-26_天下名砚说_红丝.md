The inkstone is one of the four treasures of the study. Many people believe that the Duan inkstone should be the best among all inkstones. However, the one renowned as the "number one inkstone in the world" is the Red Thread inkstone from Linqu, Shandong.

The Red Thread stone inkstone has been famous since the Tang and Song dynasties. According to the "Four Treasures of the Study" written by Su Yijian of the Song Dynasty, "There are more than 40 kinds of inkstones in the world. The Red Thread stone from Qingzhou is the best, the Kefu Mountain stone from Duanzhou is the second, and the Longwei Mountain stone from Xuanzhou is the third." It can be seen that as early as the Song Dynasty, the reputation of the Red Thread stone inkstone was already above that of Duan and Xuan. Perhaps because the Red Thread stone is of good quality, it is highly regarded by calligraphers. Liu Gongquan, Ouyang Xiu, and others all preferred to use the Red Thread inkstone.

The Red Thread stone is produced in the Heishan and Laoyakeng areas of ancient Qingzhou (now Yidu) in Shandong. The stone with yellow veins has red threads, while the stone with red veins has yellow threads. Inkstones made from this stone material are extremely famous.

By the Southern Song Dynasty, due to wars and turmoil, the Red Thread stone inkstone met with misfortune and was lost due to the exhaustion of the stone source. In 1965, relevant departments found the source of the Red Thread stone in Linqu based on historical records, and in 1973, it was successfully mined again and listed as the best among Lu inkstones.

### 天下名砚说“红丝”

　　天下名砚说“红丝”
    砚是文房四宝之一。不少人认为端砚应是诸砚之首。然而，被誉为“天下第一砚”的却是山东临朐的红丝砚。
    红丝石砚，早在唐宋时期就享有盛誉。据宋代苏易简所著《文房四谱》中记载：“天下之砚４０余品，青州红丝石第一，端州柯斧山第二，歙州龙尾山石第三。”可见，早在宋代，红丝石砚的名望就已在端、歙之上。大概是红丝石砚质地好，所以，很受书法家的推重，柳公权、欧阳修等均喜用红丝砚。
    红丝石产于山东古青州（今益都）黑山和临朐老崖崮一带。其理黄者其丝红，而理红者则丝黄。用这种石料造就的砚，极负盛名。
    到了南宋时期，兵火战乱，红丝石砚惨遭厄运，因石源枯竭而失传了。１９６５年，有关部门根据史料，找到了红丝石的产地临朐，１９７３年得以重新开采，并列于鲁砚之首。
