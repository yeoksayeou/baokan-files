With the enrichment of community cultural life in Beijing, the activities of newly established mass reading associations are attracting more and more people.

The Beijing Mass Reading Association, initiated and organized by the Beijing Women's Federation, began in July last year. It now has 16 branches and 367 lending points, with approximately 100,000 people participating in the activities. The association's main activity is reading, and members pay only 1.5 yuan per month to borrow from 60 kinds of periodicals and magazines at lending points according to their preferences.

The association is most welcomed in the rural areas of Beijing. Farmers now account for more than 60% of the total membership.

In urban areas, retired cadres and workers make up nearly half of the reading association's members. The association, with its advantages of being decentralized, widespread, and convenient for borrowing, compensates for the lack of urban cultural facilities and provides people with good spiritual nourishment.

　　北京大众读书会  吸引城乡１０万人
    据新华社北京２月１２日电  （记者罗晓路、通讯员华沂）随着北京社区文化生活的丰富，新成立的大众读书会的活动正在吸引着越来越多的人。
    由北京市妇联发起组织的北京大众读书会，自去年７月开始，现在已有１６个分会、３６７个借阅点，约有１０万多人参加活动。读书会以读书为主要活动内容，会员每月只交１．５元，就能在借阅点的６０种期刊杂志中按自己的喜好借阅。
    最欢迎大众读书会的是京郊农村，农民会员现已占会员总数的６０％以上。
    在城区，离退休干部职工占了读书会成员的近一半。读书会利用分散、面广、借阅方便的优势，弥补了城市文化设施的不足，为人们提供了良好的精神食粮。
