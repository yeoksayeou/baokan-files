The State Price Bureau has recently issued a notice regarding the conduct of a comprehensive inspection of prices for agricultural production materials during the spring plowing period.

The notice states that the comprehensive inspection of prices for agricultural production materials conducted during the spring plowing period last year uncovered a number of cases of price violations. This inspection played a certain role in curbing price hikes and excessive fees, stabilizing prices for agricultural production materials, increasing farmers' production investments, and promoting agricultural production. Before this year's spring plowing, it is necessary to continue conducting a comprehensive inspection of prices for agricultural production materials nationwide.

The notice states that this year's comprehensive inspection of prices for agricultural production materials will focus on the implementation of prices for fertilizers, diesel, plastic film, and pesticides after the issuance of the State Council's decision to implement a monopoly on these items. Major issues can be traced back to 1988. A thorough inspection of all links in the production and circulation process is required. Through this inspection, the illegal practice of layer-by-layer high-price resale must be firmly eliminated, intermediate exploitation must be eradicated, and agricultural production materials must be ensured to be sold to farmers through normal circulation channels and at prices set by the state. This will protect farmers' interests and promote agricultural development. This comprehensive inspection will be based on the "Provisions of the People's Republic of China on Price Management," the "Decision of the State Council on Strengthening Price Management and Strictly Controlling Price Increases," the "Decision of the State Council on Implementing a Monopoly on Fertilizers, Pesticides, and Plastic Film," and relevant policy boundaries. Through the inspection, illegal behaviors such as selling planned items as non-planned items at high prices, setting prices without authorization, exceeding the maximum price and comprehensive average sales price, illegal operations, high-price resale, profiteering through price negotiations, substituting inferior products, charging extra fees, or raising prices under the guise of cooperative returns must be firmly stopped.

This year's comprehensive inspection will begin now and end by the end of May. It is necessary to further improve the methods and systems for managing prices for agricultural production materials based on the issues discovered during the inspection.

The notice also requires that all levels of price inspection agencies rely on and mobilize the masses to report price violations.
