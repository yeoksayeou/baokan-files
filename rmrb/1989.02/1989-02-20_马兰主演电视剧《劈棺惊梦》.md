Huangmei opera actress Ma Lan takes the lead role in the television series "Splitting the Coffin to Awaken a Dream." This four-episode Huangmei opera television series, produced by Anhui Television Station, is adapted from the Sichuan opera "Dian Jie and Zhuang Zhou." The drama retains scenes such as "digging up graves," "testing the wife," and "splitting the coffin" from the previously banned old play "Big Coffin Splitting," but it eliminates the erotic and horrifying elements. The entire play focuses on revealing the theme that "the greatest weakness of humans is the difficulty in overcoming oneself."

　　马兰主演电视剧《劈棺惊梦》
    黄梅戏演员马兰在电视连续剧《劈棺惊梦》中担任主角。这部由安徽电视台拍摄的四集黄梅戏电视连续剧，由川剧《田姐与庄周》改编而成。剧中保留了被禁演多年的旧戏《大劈棺》的“煽坟”、“试妻”、“劈棺”等情节，但摒弃了其中色情和恐怖的内容。全剧着力揭示“人最大的弱点就是难于战胜自己”这一主题。
