The director of the "Chapultepec" Zoo in Mexico City, Maria Elena Oyo, announced today that the female panda "Yingying," a gift from the Chinese government to Mexico, died on the evening of the 29th.

The female panda "Yingying" and the male panda "Bebe" were gifted by the Chinese government to Mexico in September 1975. During their nearly 13 years in Mexico, "Yingying" gave birth to 7 cubs, 4 of which survived. However, since "Bebe" died from cancer in July of last year, "Yingying" has been in poor spirits and has had a poor appetite.

The cause of "Yingying's" illness has not yet been determined.
