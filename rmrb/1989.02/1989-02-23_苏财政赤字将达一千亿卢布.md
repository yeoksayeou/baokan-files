    The Soviet fiscal deficit is expected to reach 100 billion rubles this year, according to Soviet Finance Deputy Minister Shenchagov. He stated that this will exacerbate market supply and demand imbalances and fuel inflation.

    TASS reported today on Shenchagov's remarks. He believes that the measures to reverse the fiscal situation include significantly increasing the production of consumer goods to make up for the current 70 billion ruble shortfall in goods and services; reducing construction projects funded by centralized state investment; and shutting down loss-making enterprises.

    The Soviet deputy finance minister emphasized that it will take more than 2 to 3 years to solve the fiscal problems, and only some urgent issues can be addressed within that time frame.

    It has been noted that the issue of improving the fiscal situation has become increasingly important. The Central Committee of the CPSU Political Bureau held a meeting last week and focused on this issue.

　　苏财政赤字将达一千亿卢布
    据新华社莫斯科２月２１日电  苏联财政部副部长先恰戈夫说，苏联今年国家预算支出要比收入多１０００亿卢布，其结果将加剧市场上供求失调、助长通货膨胀。
    塔斯社今天报道了先恰戈夫的谈话。他认为，扭转财政状况的办法有：大大增加消费品生产，尽力弥补目前７００亿卢布的商品和服务空缺；减少由国家集中投资的建设项目；关闭亏损企业。
    这位苏联副财长强调，２至３年时间是不能解决财政问题的，而只能解决某些燃眉之急。
    此间人士注意到，改善财政状况问题已愈益引起关注。上周举行的苏共中央政治局例会对此作了重点讨论。
