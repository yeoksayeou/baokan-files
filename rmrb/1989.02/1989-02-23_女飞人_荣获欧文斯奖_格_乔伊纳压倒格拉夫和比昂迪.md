　　“女飞人”荣获欧文斯奖
     格·乔伊纳压倒格拉夫和比昂迪
    新华社北京２月２２日电  据外电报道：在汉城奥运会上夺得３枚金牌的美国“女飞人”格里菲斯·乔伊纳昨天在纽约获１９８９年欧文斯国际业余运动员奖。
    格·乔伊纳在第２４届奥运会上获得了女子１００米，２００米，４×１００米接力３枚金牌和４×４００米银牌，并在去年以１０秒４９和２１秒３４的惊人成绩刷新１００米和２００米两项世界纪录，成为当年国际体坛风云人物。
    在本届欧文斯奖评选中，她共获得１５９分，压倒了另两名候选人西德网球女将格拉夫和美国游泳好手比昂迪。去年世界女子网球赛“大满贯”和奥运会金牌得主格拉夫得到８５分，而获奥运会五块金牌的比昂迪只有６３分。
    欧文斯奖是为纪念曾在１９３６年柏林奥运会夺得４块金牌的美国黑人选手杰西·欧文斯设立的，每年一度颁发给“以赛场的出色表现推进各国人民合作与了解”的杰出运动员。
