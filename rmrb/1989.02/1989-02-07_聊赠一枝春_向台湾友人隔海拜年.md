A Token of Spring

—Greetings to Friends in Taiwan Across the Strait

Kē Líng

Time flies, and I am now eighty years old. This is the first time I am sending New Year greetings across the strait to friends in Taiwan, whether known or unknown. The warmth and bitterness intertwine, a feeling I rarely experience in life.

I have always been narrow-minded and ignorant, but in recent years, I have had the opportunity to meet some friends from Taiwan and read many works by Taiwanese writers. Upon first acquaintance, it feels like meeting old friends, for I am surprised to find that in their writings, joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness are so close to my heart. Despite the vast sea and sky between us, our hearts are connected, with no barriers in between. I admire Yú Guāngzhōng, a poet and essayist, whose elegant brush often makes me linger and admire, unable to help myself. I believe his essays have achieved a unique style since the May Fourth Movement. Recently, I was fortunate to receive his poem "Yíxīng Tea Pot," which is truly an honor! I have also had the chance to meet Zhang Lánxī, Lín Hǎiyīn, Pán Rénmù, Wáng Lán, and Yáo Péng, and have seen their moving literary and artistic works. What makes me particularly happy is that Fènghuáng, Xiāo Jǐntiān, and Qín Xiáncì visited Shanghai recently and kindly inquired after me. We met as if we were old friends, chatting and laughing freely. Last month in Beijing, I also had the fortune to dine with the poet Gāo Zhǔn. I sincerely wish the aforementioned friends a happy New Year and continuous new works. I had the fortune to meet Yáng Mù in Tokyo, and his elegant demeanor is still fresh in my memory. He edited "Selected Modern Chinese Essays," and the Beijing China Friendship Publishing Company published the Taiwan writers' part, naming it "Selected Taiwanese Essays." I was entrusted to write a preface, and through this literary connection, I was able to glimpse the brilliant landscape of Taiwanese essays and admire many talented writers. Zhèng Shùsēn and I met in Hong Kong. My essays "Remembering Fù Lěi" and "Far-off Greetings to Zhang Ailing" were introduced by him and published in "United Literature," allowing me to meet Taiwanese readers. These two are in the United States, and I also take this opportunity to send my greetings across the mountains and seas. Zhang Ailing's name had been forgotten on the mainland for over 30 years, but in recent years, she has blossomed again in the literary world, receiving readers' praise. "The Golden Cangue" has been adapted for the screen, and I watched the trial screening yesterday. It basically follows the spirit of the original, but the title has been changed to "Yesterday's Moon." In the newspaper records, it is said that this is "a meaningful thing for literary exchange between the mainland and overseas." The production team sent a VHS tape, asking me to convey their greetings to the author and stating that they will keep the original manuscript royalties. I can only send the tape to Ailing's aunt to receive it and ask her to convey my New Year wishes. I have long heard of Zhāng Shēn's poetic fame, and it was he who gave me the first opportunity to publish new works in the "United Daily" supplement. I cherish this literary friendship, although we have not had the chance to meet.

I also have some old acquaintances in Taiwan, but unfortunately, we have been separated for many years and have lost contact. In the 1930s, my colleagues at Mingxing Film Company, the famous actor Gōng Jiānónɡ, is rumored to have passed away long ago; Hú Dié is known to have emigrated to Canada, and recently, her memoirs have been published on the mainland, recalling past events that I also experienced. The literary friend Suó Fēi went to Taiwan with emotional scars, and his two children are on the mainland. Recently, with the opening of the two sides, I had hoped for a day of candlelight conversation, but a few days ago, I heard from Bā Jīn that Suó Fēi passed away not long ago, and now we are forever separated. May he rest in peace on the island, and may his soul return! Liáng Shíqiū is a literary predecessor, and I have never had the chance to interact with him. I only recently had the pleasure of reading "Yǎshè Xiǎopǐn." It is embarrassing to say that I had little understanding of this predecessor in the past, but his infamous reputation was already "as loud as thunder." A few years ago, I bravely spoke out against the "War of Resistance Irrelevance Theory" despite the public's disapproval, only out of a desire for truth. I heard that Liáng Shíqiū had heard of this before his death, and I felt very gratified. Recently, I saw the newly published "Encyclopedia of China" on the mainland, which still insists that Liáng Shíqiū "proposed that literature can be unrelated to the War of Resistance." I strongly suspect that this is still the result of hearsay and rumormongering; if it has indeed been verified and judged so, then it is truly "when the crime is determined, what fear is there of lacking evidence."

I also recall two Taiwanese friends who were in prison with me during the Shanghai occupation period. It was in June 1943 when I was first arrested by the Japanese military police and met them by chance. I left a record of this in my old work "Prison Poems" over forty years ago, and now I transcribe it as follows:

	Quelling the spring of sorrow for twenty years,
	The iron window is also a world of its own,
	Hearing the distant streetcar in the wind,
	The returning dream is pulled back to Taiwan.

	At the beginning of my imprisonment, there was a Taiwanese man, Lin, in the same cell with me. He came from Zhenjiang to Shanghai to escape conscription but was captured by the enemy police. Lin was only twenty years old, anxious and depressed, unable to free himself. In the quiet night, sitting alone, the dim lamp, the distant sound of a streetcar, carried by the wind, clear and distant. Lin listened intently for a long time, then asked, "Is that a streetcar?" I nodded. He raised his head slightly, looking at the high window, longingly saying, "It's so good outside!" He couldn't help but sigh deeply. I had no words of comfort, only felt lost.

	Do not ask about the good scenery of the South Sea,
	The blue sky and green mountains are all heartbreaking,
	Is it that a man is willing to give up his armor?
	I am also a descendant of China.

	Another Li, also a Taiwanese deserter, was captured with Lin at the same time. His temperament seemed more open than Lin's, and he once described the scenery of Taiwan in vivid detail. When asked why he wanted to escape, he said, "We are originally Chinese, why should we fight our own people!" A few days later, the two were transferred to the enemy military police headquarters on North Sichuan Road and sentenced by military law. Today, they must have seen the light of day again! (From "Kē Líng's Miscellaneous Essays," page 403)

	As I write this, I suddenly have a distant thought: I wish these two friends are still alive and can accept my New Year greetings. Looking back at the past, they would smile, that would be great!

	From the moment I was born until I am now white-haired, I have almost never escaped the turmoil and hardship of the times. This year, I finally saw the first faint light of dawn on the horizon. Surviving the disaster, spring is in sight, and I can't help but feel a bit overwhelmed with joy. The Southern Dynasty poet Lù Kǎi wrote: "Picking flowers to meet the courier, sending them to the people of Longshan, there is nothing in Jiangnan, just a token of spring." Let us celebrate peace under heaven and the blessings of all beings on both sides of the strait, and let literature and art flourish!

　　聊赠一枝春
　　——向台湾友人隔海拜年
　　柯灵
    岁月不居，行年八十，隔海向台湾识与不识的朋友拜年，却还是破题儿第一遭。温馨与辛酸的滋味一时交集，这种感受，生平也很难得。
    我一向孤陋寡闻，近年来有机会结识一些台湾朋友，读了不少台湾作家的作品，乍接新知，如逢旧雨，因为我惊喜地发见，字里行间，喜怒哀乐，彼此竟如此亲近，海天遥隔，而心路相通，不存在任何隔阂。余光中先生是我倾心折节的诗人和散文家，他的锦心彩笔，常使我低徊赞叹，不能自己。他的散文成就，我认为“五四”以来，到他笔下，无疑已别开一境，更上一层。最近还得到他见赠的咏物诗《宜兴茶壶》，真是太荣幸了！张兰熙、林海音、潘人木女士，王蓝、姚朋先生，都曾在海外有缘识荆，并接触他们动人心目的文品和画品。使我特别高兴的，是应凤凰、萧锦棉女士和秦贤次先生不久前来上海，先后惠然存问，一见如故，纵谈笑乐，竟是这样的无拘无束。上月在北京，还有幸与诗人高准同席宴饮。我在此深深祝祷，愿上述诸位新春百吉，并不断有新作问世。杨牧先生曾有幸萍聚东京，人如其文，潇洒的风度记忆犹新。他主编的《中国近代散文选》，北京中国友谊出版公司曾将其中台湾作家的部分印行，命名《台湾散文选》，我受嘱写序，由此一线文缘，得以窥台湾散文灿然如锦的气象，对许多文采斐然的作家心向往之。郑树森先生是在香港相识的，拙文《怀傅雷》和《遥寄张爱玲》，正是赖他挈引，在《联合文学》和台湾读者相见。这两位远在美国，我也藉此隔山带海，向他们越洋道候。张爱玲的名字在大陆湮没３０余年，近年来铁树重葩，在书林次第争发，受读者称赏。 《金锁记》已搬上荧屏，我昨天应邀看了试映，基本附合原作精神，只是片名改为《昨天的月亮》。在报纸的记载中，说这是“为海内外文学交流做了一件很有意义的事情”。摄制组送来一盒录像带，请转向作者致意，并声明他们代为保存原著稿酬。我只好把录像带就近送爱玲的姑姑代收，请她传语，新岁珍重。久闻痖弦先生诗名，是他给了我第一次在《联合报》副刊发表新作的幸运。我很珍视这种文字之交，虽然我们缘吝一面。
    我也有些蓬飘台湾的旧相识，可惜多年隔绝，反而音信杳然。３０年代明星公司的同事，著名的电影演员龚稼农，风闻久已弃世；胡蝶女士知已侨居加拿大，最近大陆出版了她的回忆录，往事历历，有的我也曾身与其境。文学界的旧友索非，是带着感情上的伤痕去台湾的，一双儿女都在大陆，最近两岸开放，原指望有剪烛西窗的一天，前几天听巴金先生说起，索非已在不久前去世，从此人天永隔。愿他安眠海岛，魂兮归来！梁实秋先生是文学界前辈，素无交往，得读《雅舍小品》之快，也还是近期的事。说来惭愧，过去对这位前辈了解不多，对他的骂名却早已“如雷贯耳”。前年甘犯众怒，为“抗战无关论”大胆鸣冤，也只是出于一点求实之心。听说梁先生生前对此曾有所闻，我感到十分欣慰。最近看到大陆新出《中国大百科全书》的中国文学卷，依然一口咬定梁实秋“提出文学可以与抗战无关的主张”。我很怀疑这仍是百口悠悠，耳食吞吐的结果；如果确曾查证出处，而又作此武断，那真是“欲加之罪，何患无辞”了。
    我还想起了上海沦陷时期，在日本监狱里的两位台湾难友，那是在１９４３年６月，我第一次被日本宪兵队逮捕时邂逅相逢的，曾在四十多年前的旧作《狱中诗记》里留有鸿爪，现在转钞如下：愁绝春华二十年，铁窗此亦一人间，遥听街车风送远，却曳归梦到台湾。
    入狱之初，同牢有一台湾人林君，自镇江潜来上海，图逃兵役，而为敌宪所捕。林年才二十，焦灼牢愁，不克自拔。静夜兀坐，灯火昏黄，远处有电车声，因风吹送，清越悠远。林侧耳谛听良久，愀然问道：“是电车吗？”我点点头。他微昂着首，向那高高的窗洞，不胜神往地说：“在外头是多么好啊！”说了不禁深深叹一口气。我无以为慰，惟有惘然。
    莫问南海好风情，
    碧落苍山总断魂，
    岂是男儿甘捐甲，
    我亦中华一子孙。
    另一李君，亦台湾逃兵，是与林同时被捕的，性情似较林豁达，曾为道台湾风物，历历如绘。问为什么要逃，则云：“我们本来就是中国人，为什么要打自己人呢！”越日，二君终被移解北四川路敌宪兵总队，以军法处治。今当获重见天日矣！（《柯灵杂文集》第４０３页）
    走笔至此，忽发遐想：但愿这两位难友至今健在，能接受我的新春祝贺，回首前尘，破颜一笑，那就太好了！
    自我呱呱坠地，直至白发三千，几乎没有摆脱过动乱艰难的世运，今年终于看到了地平线上冒出第一道缓和的曙光，劫后余生，春回在望，真不禁有点喜心翻倒的感觉。南朝陆凯诗云：“折花逢驿使，寄与陇头人，江南无所有，聊赠一枝春。”让我们在海峡两岸共庆天下太平，众生多福，文学艺术繁荣昌盛！
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　１９８８年除夕，上海。
