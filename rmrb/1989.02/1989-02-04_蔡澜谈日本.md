Title: Cai Lan on Japan
Author: Huang Miaozi

Edition: 8

		Cai Lan, a friend of mine, is still in his middle years, yet he never parts with his glass of foreign liquor, and his speech always seems a bit tipsy. However, his prose writing is top-notch, with a style reminiscent of Zhang Dai from the late Ming dynasty, and his career achievements are also impressive. Recently, he gave me two books he published in Hong Kong: “Cai Lan on Japan” and “Cai Lan on Japan Again.”

		Each of the short essays in these books is less than a thousand words, seemingly rambling, covering Japanese customs, lifestyle habits, politics, economics, and even Sino-Japanese relations. But when read together, a vivid and lively portrait of modern Japan emerges in your mind, not only entertaining but also thought-provoking: Japanese uses a lot of Chinese characters, but once they use them, strange things happen.

		The most obvious example is the Japanese word “大丈夫,” which means “no problem” or “it’s okay.”

		“有难” means “thank you.”

		“切手” is surprisingly “stamp.”

		He also says: The Chinese character “庭鸟一羽” means “a chicken.” Although I don’t understand Japanese, from Cai Lan’s words, I recall the Japanese Chinese characters I know and have always found interesting: “无茶苦荣” means “messy,” and a person’s laziness is written in Japanese Chinese characters as “吞气.”

		This century is an era of intense cultural exchange between the East and the West. Chinese characters, which have traditionally been written from right to left, have been changed to be read from left to right due to horizontal writing and Western influence. However, conservative habits still persist in reading from right to left, which sometimes causes problems. Cai Lan says:

		One day, walking past a department store, he saw a horizontal advertisement and was surprised. It read “出卖大日本”—habitually reading it from right to left. It turned out to be the Japanese Chinese characters “本日大卖出”—“big sale today”—read from left to right.

		It turns out that “大卖出,” “大出血,” and “大乱卖” all mean “big sale.” Because of Cai Lan’s words, I remember that ten years ago in Beijing’s Liulichang, someone suggested that signs should follow the old habit of being read from right to left, while someone else suggested from left to right. In the stalemate, Professor Qi Gong spoke up: “This problem is easy to solve; just draw an arrow under the sign, and people will know whether to read it from right to left or left to right.” Naturally, everyone could not accept this reasonable suggestion.

		Cai Lan describes the old Japanese custom of ritual suicide by disembowelment, saying:

		No matter how you say it, it’s just a final performance by an exhibitionist.

　　蔡澜谈日本
　　黄苗子
    朋友蔡澜，虽然还是中年人，整天洋酒不离杯，说话似乎总带点醉意。可是散文写作却是一流的，风格有点像明末的张岱，事业成就也不错。最近送我他在香港出版的两本书：《蔡澜谈日本》，《蔡澜再谈日本》。
    一篇篇不到千字的短文，看起来东拉西扯，把日本的人情风俗、生活习惯、政治经济，甚至日中关系都扯进去。但综起来看，现代日本的基本面貌，就生动活泼地浮现在你脑海中，不但趣味盎然，而且发人深思：日文少不了汉字，但是汉字经他们一用，奇怪的事发生了。
    最显明的例子是日文中的“大丈夫”，做“不要紧”解释。
    “有难”，是“谢谢”的意思。
    “切手”，却是匪夷所思的“邮票”。
    他又说：汉字“庭鸟一羽”，是“一只鸡”的意思。我虽不懂日文，但从蔡澜这段话中，叫我想起我知道而一直觉得有趣的日文汉字：“无茶苦荣”，是“乱七八糟”的意思，而一个人的懒散，日本汉字却写作“吞气”。
    本世纪是东、西文化互相参杂最繁剧的时代，一向由右到左排列的汉字，由于横写和西方同化，便改为由左到右来读，但是，保守的习惯则仍然由右到左，这样，有时就出了问题。蔡澜说：
    有一天走过一家百货公司，看到一条横书的广告，不禁惊奇，它写着“出卖大日本”──习惯性地将它由右读。原来却是由左写至右的日本汉字“本日大卖出”──今天大减价。
    原来，“大卖出”、“大出血”、“大乱卖”，都是大减价的意思。由于蔡澜这段文字，记得十年前在北京琉璃厂开会，有人主张招牌应按旧习惯由右向左，有人主张由左向右。在相持不下中，启功教授发言：“这问题好解决，只须在招牌下面画个箭头，人家就都知道由右向左或由左向右读了”。自然，大家无法接受这个合理化建议。
    蔡澜描写了日本的切腹自杀旧习，他说：
    怎么说都好，其实，这只是暴露狂的一场最后表演。
