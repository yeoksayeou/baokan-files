The Chinese Go Championship Sees Dramatic Turns as Top Players Fall

The second round of the second Chinese Go Championship, co-hosted by the People's Daily Overseas Edition and the Chinese Go Association, was played today. Among the top players, only Moneyu Ping remains in the competition.

In the first three rounds, Jiang Zhujiu, a 9th dan player, and Rui Nawei, another 9th dan player, were unexpectedly defeated by Wang Hongjun, a 7th dan player, and Hua Xue Ming, a 6th dan player, respectively. None of the 10 young players advanced past the first round. The experienced players seemed to have learned from the previous championship where Wang Qun, an 8th dan player, lost to Xiao Changhao. They played more cautiously against the younger players. The young players, on the other hand, lacked experience and their skills were not yet fully developed.

In today's six matches, Yang Hui, a 7th dan player, playing white, defeated Hua Xue Ming in the middle of the game. In the same group, Cao Da Yuan, a 9th dan player, playing black, lost to Fang Tianfeng, a 7th dan player, by five and a quarter points. This result disappointed Go enthusiasts who were looking forward to seeing Cao Da Yuan and Yang Hui, a married couple, play against each other. In Group A, Lu Jianyuan, a 5th dan player from Fujian, playing black, defeated Wang Hongjun, a 7th dan player from Henan, in the middle of the game. Wang Qun, an 8th dan player, playing white, narrowly defeated Wang Yuan, a 7th dan player, by a quarter point. In Group C, Zhang Wendu and Che Zewu, both 6th dan players, had a fierce battle. The board was complex, and in the end, Che Zewu, playing white, defeated Zhang Wendu by a quarter point. In the same group, Moneyu Ping, a 9th dan player, playing black, defeated Jin Weibin, a 7th dan player, in the middle of the game.

The first stage of this championship still has one round left. On the 22nd, the three groups will compete in the finals to determine which three players will advance to the next round.

　　围棋名人战波澜起伏
    九段棋手江铸久芮乃伟失利
    本报北京２月２０日讯  记者陈昭报道：由人民日报海外版和中国围棋协会共同举办的第二届中国围棋名人战今天又赛一轮，在杀出重围的棋手中，九段仅剩钱宇平一人。
    在已进行的前三轮比赛中，江铸久九段和芮乃伟九段分别败给了王洪军七段和华学明六段，这一结果令行家们大出意外。１０名少年棋手均未闯过第一轮。参赛的国手们显然接受了上届名人战王群八段负于小常昊的教训，在与小棋手的对弈中，落子谨慎。小棋手们输在经验不足，功力火候尚不到家。
    在今天进行的六盘比赛中，Ｂ组杨晖七段执白中盘胜华学明。同组的曹大元九段执黑以五又四分之一子负于方天丰七段。这个结果使围棋爱好者失去了一次欣赏曹大元、杨晖夫妇公开对弈的“好戏”。Ａ组的福建选手罗建元五段执黑中盘胜河南的王洪军七段。王群八段执白以四分之一子险胜王元七段。同为六段的张文东和车泽武在Ｃ组的比赛中也是杀得难解难分，棋盘形势错综复杂，最后车泽武执白亦以四分之一子杀败张文东。同组的钱宇平九段执黑中盘胜金渭滨七段。
    本届名人战第一阶段的比赛还剩最后一轮，２２日，三组棋手进行决赛，以确定哪三位棋手能进入循环圈。
