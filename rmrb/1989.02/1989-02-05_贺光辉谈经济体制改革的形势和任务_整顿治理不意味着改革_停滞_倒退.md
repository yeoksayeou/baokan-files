    He Guanghui on the Situation and Tasks of Economic System Reform
    Rectification and Ordering Do Not Mean Reform is "Stagnant" or "Reversing"

    Xinhua News Agency Beijing, February 4th - Vice Minister of the State Commission for Restructuring the Economic System, He Guanghui, recently answered questions from a reporter regarding the current situation of reform and the main tasks for this year.

    Q: In the past year, due to new difficulties in the reform, some people believe that the reform has stagnated, or even reversed. How do you evaluate this?

    A: Last year, China's economy indeed faced complex situations such as overheating, significant inflation, and disorderly markets, leading to considerable difficulties in both the economy and reform. In response to this, the Third Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee proposed to rectify the economic environment and order the economic system, which was completely necessary. However, this does not mean that the reform has "stagnated" or "reversed." On the contrary, over the past year, the reform has consistently followed the direction set by the 13th Party Congress, overcoming various difficulties and achieving new progress in various fields.

    Q: For the next two years, the focus of reform and construction will be on rectification and ordering. In this context, what should we pay attention to in terms of the guiding ideology of reform?

    A: To do a good job in this year's economic system reform, we must adhere to two principles: first, adhere to the overall policy of further reform and opening up as determined by the 13th Party Congress; second, adhere to the policy of "rectifying the economic environment, ordering the economic system, and deepening the reform comprehensively" proposed by the Third Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee. We must not waver on these two points. On this basis, in terms of reform, we should focus on developing and improving the various reform measures that have been introduced, while also actively and cautiously conducting new reform trials and explorations in some areas or specific reforms. Moreover, all reform measures should be conducive to controlling investment and consumption demand, curbing inflation; conducive to promoting industrial structure adjustment, improving economic efficiency, and increasing effective supply; conducive to promoting the transformation of the economic mechanism, and gradually establishing a new order for socialist commodity economy.

    Q: What are the main tasks for this year's economic system reform?

    A: This year's economic system reform should focus on the following five aspects:

    First, we must prioritize deepening enterprise reform and improving economic efficiency; second, we should work hard to establish a macro-control system that is conducive to overall balance and structural optimization; third, we should curb and guide consumption, alleviate unfair distribution, and promote the transformation of the distribution mechanism; fourth, we should rectify market order and promote the development and improvement of market organizations; fifth, we should strengthen the research and formulation of mid-term reform plans and continue to promote comprehensive reform pilot projects.

    Q: Can you discuss the specific content of each reform?

    A: First, let's talk about deepening enterprise reform. The key to overcoming the current economic difficulties lies in the enterprises. As long as the enterprises' enthusiasm is fully mobilized, the self-discipline mechanism is established, and economic efficiency is significantly improved, the entire national economy will be revitalized. The only way out for enterprises is to deepen the reform. Here, we need to focus on three points: first, we should further improve and develop the contract responsibility system, deepen the internal supporting reforms of enterprises, implement the "Enterprise Law," and establish and improve the competition mechanism, risk mechanism, and self-discipline mechanism of enterprises; second, according to the principle of paid transfer of property rights, we should actively promote enterprise mergers, accelerate the flow of production factors, and focus on supporting and cultivating a number of large enterprise groups to truly become the backbone of national economic development and foreign trade; third, within a certain scope, we should reform the property rights relationship, and conduct planned and guided trials and explorations of new forms of public ownership, including gradually implementing the stock system with public ownership as the mainstay, and gradually auctioning off small state-owned enterprises. Here, it is particularly important to emphasize that the implementation of the stock system and the auctioning of small enterprises should not be done in a rushed manner, and especially, we must strictly prevent the expansion of consumption funds under the guise of the stock system.

    Q: Why is it emphasized that we should gradually establish a macro-control system that is conducive to overall balance and structural optimization?

    A: After ten years of reform, compared to the overly centralized traditional system, an objective situation is forming where economic decision-making power is decentralized and economic interests are diversified. Facing this reality, it is particularly important to, through reform, accelerate the establishment of a macro-control system that can effectively implement overall control and promote the adjustment and optimization of industrial and product structures, truly achieving "control without stagnation and activity without chaos." This year, we should work with relevant departments to focus on the following points: first, we should focus on the key link of reforming the investment planning system, truly making the plan cover the entire society, especially seeking effective ways to guide and regulate the direction and behavior of off-budget funds, consumption funds, and non-state-owned economic entities. We should strive to achieve a rough balance between total demand and total supply. Second, we should strengthen and improve the financial system reform, strengthen the central bank's independent execution of monetary and credit policies, adhere to the direction of professional banks operating in an enterprise-like manner, and actively do various basic work. Third, we should improve the fiscal and tax system and strengthen tax collection and administration. We should expand the trial of changing enterprise pre-tax repayment to post-tax repayment.

    Q: Currently, there are some issues in social distribution and consumption that cannot be ignored. What are the plans for reform in this area this year?

    A: Both domestic and international experiences show that distribution and consumption issues are a major problem that is extremely difficult to solve but must be solved in the process of reform in socialist countries. The potential problems here are: first, the growth of consumption exceeds the actual growth of production; second, while egalitarianism still exists, social distribution is unfair. In fact, both of these problems have occurred in our country and are continuing to develop. This year's reform must make progress in solving this problem. First, we must further improve the method of linking enterprise wage totals with benefits, plugging loopholes such as issuing bonuses and goods indiscriminately and shifting burdens to consumers through arbitrary price increases. Second, we should use tax measures to adjust income distribution and reduce the loss of fiscal revenue. Third, we should promote the adjustment of consumption structure and guide the diversion of purchasing power. This includes increasing the interest rate on savings deposits, increasing currency withdrawal; encouraging urban and rural residents to purchase bonds and stocks, converting part of the consumption fund into accumulation fund; accelerating the commercialization of housing reform; and starting to establish a new social insurance system, reforming the unreasonable practice of the state taking everything.

    Q: Rectifying market order is an important aspect of deepening reform. What are the main contents of this year's rectification?

    A: The specific contents of rectifying market order mainly include: continuing to clean up and rectify various types of companies and wholesale enterprises; vigorously promoting the openness and voucherization of transactions, strictly requiring operators to establish standard business ledgers; strengthening price management, resolutely controlling price increases; strictly enforcing the various market regulations that have been issued, establishing and improving market rules, and promptly formulating new regulations such as anti-monopoly laws and anti-unfair trade laws. We should also continue to develop various markets, expand the circulation of commodities and production factors. Particularly, we should pay attention to promoting the development of new market organizations, such as piloting large-scale production and sales integrated enterprise groups and comprehensive trading companies in some cities and regions; setting up pilot agricultural product futures markets and auction markets; piloting regional common markets in coastal open areas or other suitable areas; opening up property rights transfer markets, etc., to promote the further prosperity of the socialist commodity economy.

    Q: Finally, please share your thoughts on the research and pilot work of the mid-term reform plan.

    A: Reform is an extremely complex economic and social system project that must be planned, piloted, and reduced in blindness to ensure that the reform progresses actively and steadily. Here, I would like to emphasize two points: First, the reform plan must have a clear direction and be based on reality, not on models. First, it must be closely combined with the objective requirements of the next two years of rectification and ordering and the "Eighth Five-Year Plan" period of social and economic development, and determine the phased goals and steps of the reform according to the development strategy and financial and economic strength, avoiding unrealistic and hasty approaches.

    Second, for major reforms, if there is no experience or if the conditions for full-scale promotion are not met, pilot projects should be conducted first, such as the stock system, tax and profit sharing, the establishment of a social security system, and housing reform, all of which should be piloted and then promoted. Pilot projects should not rely on "eating special food" or giving more preferential treatment, as such pilot projects, even if very lively, lack promotional value. They can only rely on boldly innovating and achieving real benefits in the direction of developing a socialist planned commodity economy. Only such pilot projects have persuasiveness and can play a demonstration role.

　　贺光辉谈经济体制改革的形势和任务
　　整顿治理不意味着改革“停滞”“倒退”
    新华社北京２月４日电  国家体改委副主任贺光辉日前在接受本社记者采访时，就当前改革形势和今年改革的主要任务，回答了记者的提问。
    问：在过去的一年里，由于改革出现了新的困难，有人认为改革停滞了，甚至倒退了，请问对此您如何估价？
    答：去年，我国经济确实出现了经济过热、明显的通货膨胀、市场秩序比较混乱等复杂形势，经济和改革都遇到了较大的困难。正是针对这种情况，党的十三届三中全会提出要治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序，这是完全必要的。但是，这并不意味着改革“停滞了”、“倒退了”。恰恰相反，一年来改革始终沿着党的十三大所确定的方向，克服种种困难，在各个领域取得了不少新进展。
    问：今明两年，改革和建设的重点要放到治理和整顿上，在这种情况下，从改革的指导思想上应注意些什么？
    答：搞好今年的经济体制改革，首先要在指导原则上做到两个坚持：一是坚持党的十三大确定的进一步改革、开放的总方针；二是坚持党的十三届三中全会提出的“治理经济环境，整顿经济秩序，全面深化改革”的方针。对于这两条，我们不能有丝毫的动摇。在这个前提下，从改革方面讲，要把工作重点放在发展和完善已经出台的各项改革措施上，同时在一些点上或者在某些单项改革上积极而慎重地进行新的改革试验和探索。而且各项改革措施，都要有利于控制投资需求和消费需求，抑制通货膨胀；有利于促进产业结构调整，提高经济效益，增加有效供给；有利于推动经济机制的转换，逐步建立社会主义商品经济新秩序。
    问：今年经济体制改革的主要任务是什么？
    答：今年的经济体制改革，要着重抓好以下五个方面：
    第一，必须把深化企业改革、提高经济效益，放在首要的位置上；第二，要在逐步建立有利于总量平衡和结构优化的宏观调控体系上下大功夫；第三，要抑制和引导消费，缓解分配不公，促进分配机制转换；第四，整顿市场秩序，促进市场组织的发育和完善；第五，加强改革中期规划的研究制定工作，继续抓好综合改革试点。
    问：您能否具体地谈一谈各项改革的内容？
    答：首先谈谈深化企业改革的问题。我们要克服当前经济困难的关键在于企业，只要企业的积极性充分调动起来了，自我约束机制建立起来了，经济效益显著提高了，整个国民经济就能全盘皆活。企业唯一的出路是深化改革。这里要抓住三个要点：一是进一步完善和发展承包经营责任制，深化企业内部的配套改革，贯彻落实《企业法》，建立和健全企业的竞争机制、风险机制和自我约束机制；二是按照产权有偿转让原则，积极推进企业兼并，加快生产要素流动，重点扶植和培育若干大型企业集团，使之真正成为发展国民经济和对外贸易的骨干力量；三是在一定范围进行改革产权关系，有计划有领导地试验和探索公有制的新形式，包括稳步试行以公有制为主体的股份制、有计划有步骤地拍卖国有小企业等等。这里需要特别强调一点，搞股份制、拍卖小企业，不能“刮风”，不能一哄而起，尤其要严格防止以股份制为名，扩大消费基金。
    问：为什么强调要逐步建立有利于总量平衡和结构优化的宏观调控体系？
    答：经过十年改革，相对于过度集权的传统体制而言，现在客观上正在形成一种经济决策权趋于分散、经济利益趋于多元化的格局。面对这种现实，特别需要通过改革，加速建立一套既能有效地实行总量控制、又能促进产业结构、产品结构的调整和优化的宏观调控体系，真正做到“控而不死、活而不乱”。今年我们应该协同有关部门抓住以下要点：一是要抓住计划投资体制改革这个关键环节，真正做到使计划覆盖全社会，尤其要寻求加强对预算外资金、对消费基金、对非国有经济单位的经营方向及行为的引导和调节的有效办法。要尽量做到总需求与总供给大体平衡。二是加强和完善金融体制改革，加强中央银行独立执行货币政策和信贷政策的职能，坚持专业银行实行企业化经营的方向，并积极做好各项基础性工作。三是改进财税体制，强化税收征管工作。扩大将企业税前还贷改为税后还贷的试点。
    问：当前在社会分配和消费方面存在着一些不容忽视的问题，今年改革在这方面有何打算？
    答：国内和国际经验都表明，分配问题和消费问题是社会主义国家改革过程中极难解决而又必须解决的一大难题。这里容易发生的弊病，一是消费的增长超过生产的实际增长；二是在平均主义仍然存在的同时，又出现社会分配不公。事实上，这两方面的弊病在我国都已经发生，并且还在不断发展。今年的改革，一定要在解决这个难题上有所作为。首先是要进一步完善企业工资总额与效益挂钩的办法，堵住滥发奖金、实物以及通过随意涨价向消费者转嫁负担的漏洞。其次要运用税收手段，调节收入分配，减少财政收入的流失。再次，要促进消费结构的调整，引导购买力分流。这里包括提高储蓄存款利率，增加货币回笼；鼓励城乡居民购买债券、股票，将一部分消费基金转化为积累基金；加快住房商品化改革的步伐；着手建立新的社会保险制度，改革一切由国家包下来的不合理做法。
    问：整顿市场秩序是深化改革的重要方面，今年的整顿主要包括哪些内容？
    答：整顿市场秩序的具体内容主要有：继续抓紧清理整顿各类公司和批发企业；大力推行交易的公开化、票据化，严格要求经营者建立符合标准的营业帐簿；加强物价管理，坚决控制价格上涨；严肃已经颁布的各项市场法规，建立健全市场规则，并抓紧制定反垄断法、反不正当交易法等新的法规条例。还要继续发展各类市场，扩大商品和生产要素的流通。特别要注意促进新型市场组织的发育，如在一些城市和地区试行大型产销一体化的企业集团、综合商社；试办农产品期货市场、拍卖市场；在沿海开放地区或其它有条件的地区试办区域性共同市场；开辟产权转让市场等等，推动社会主义商品经济的进一步繁荣。
    问：最后，请您谈谈在改革的中期规划研究和试点工作方面的想法。
    答：改革是极其复杂的经济社会系统工程，必须制定规划，搞好试点，减少盲目性，使改革积极稳妥地向前推进。这里我想强调两点：第一，搞改革规划必须明确大方向，必须从实际出发，而不是从模式出发。首先是要紧密结合近两年治理整顿和“八五”计划期间社会经济发展的客观要求，根据发展战略和财政经济的实力来确定改革的阶段性目标和步骤，避免脱离实际、急于求成。
    第二，各项重大改革，在没有取得经验以前，或者不具备全面推开的条件，都应先行试点，如股份制、税利分流、社会保障体系的建立、住房改革等，都应进行试点，成功后再推开。搞试点不能靠“吃偏饭”、多给优惠，那样的试点即使搞得很热闹，也缺少推广的价值。只能靠按照发展社会主义有计划商品经济的方向，大胆开拓创新，取得实实在在的效益。这样的试点才有说服力，才能发挥示范作用。
