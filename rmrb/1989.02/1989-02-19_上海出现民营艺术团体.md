Shanghai has seen the emergence of two private art troupes: the "Shanghai May Fourth Little Theater" and the "Shanghai Huaxia Cultural Art Troupe." This marks a new step in the reform of Shanghai's performing arts troupes.

Both of these private art troupes focus on creating and performing dramas, while also engaging in television drama production, television program shooting, and various other performing arts activities. Economically, they operate on a self-raised funds, self-bear profits and losses, and independent accounting basis, and have the autonomy to recruit personnel and select plays. On February 18, the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Culture issued permits to these two art troupes.

　　上海出现民营艺术团体
    本报上海电  上海文艺界首次出现了两个民营艺术创作演出实体：“上海五四小剧院”和“上海华夏文化艺术团”。这是上海艺术表演团体改革迈出的新步伐。
    这两个民营艺术团体都以创作演出话剧为主，兼搞电视剧、电视片摄制及歌舞演出等其它艺术活动。在经济上实行自筹资金、自负盈亏、独立核算，并有招聘人员及剧目等方面的自主权。上海市文化局在２月１８日向这两个艺术团体颁发了许可证。
