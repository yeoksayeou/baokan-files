The News Law Research Center, which focuses on studying news law theories and practices both domestically and internationally and providing consulting services for China's news law construction, held a news legislation symposium today. Over 50 people from the news industry, legal scholars, and party and government officials involved in news law research in the capital attended the meeting. The first director of the research center and the chairman of the Academic Committee of Peking University, Wang Xuezhen, introduced the establishment process and main tasks of this academic institution.

During the meeting, Zhang Youyu, Li Zhuang, Li Pu, Xie Wenqing, and more than 10 others discussed the guiding ideology of China's news law and its main contents. Many attendees said that the purpose of formulating a news law is to realize the freedom of speech as stipulated in the constitution. Therefore, the news law should clearly stipulate the protection of news freedom. The news law should be a law that protects the rights of news workers, rather than a law that restricts news freedom or a news management law.

The China News Law Research Center was established in 1988 to meet the actual needs of strengthening research and accelerating the formulation of news laws. It was jointly initiated by researchers from Peking University and the Press and Publication Administration. Currently, it has more than 40 researchers at the level of associate professor and above. The research center is actively seeking support from news and legal experts, scholars, and relevant organizations both domestically and internationally, and is carrying out cooperative and exchange activities.

　　新闻法制研究中心座谈新闻立法
    本报北京２月２日讯  记者王礼明报道：以研究中外新闻法理论与实践，为我国新闻法制建设提供咨询服务的中国新闻法制研究中心，今天在这里举行新闻立法座谈会。首都５０余名新闻界、法学界以及党政机关从事新闻法制研究的人士出席了会议。研究中心第一主任、北京大学校务委员会主任王学珍介绍了这一民间学术机构成立的经过和主要任务。
    会上，张友渔、李庄、李普、谢文清等１０多人就我国新闻法的指导思想和它应当包含的主要内容发表了意见。许多同志说，制定新闻法是为了实现宪法上规定的言论自由，因此，在新闻法中，应明确规定保障新闻自由。要把新闻法搞成保护新闻工作者权利的法，而不能搞成限制新闻自由的法，搞成新闻管理法。
    中国新闻法制研究中心是为了适应加强研究和加快制定新闻法的实际需要，由北京大学和新闻出版署等单位的研究人员联合发起，于１９８８年成立的。目前有相当于副教授以上的研究员４０余名。研究中心正在国内外争取新闻界、法学界专家、学者及有关组织的支持，开展合作与交流活动。
