	Domestic Refrigerators Classified into A, B, C, D Grades
	Light Industry Department Publishes First Batch of Quality Test Results

	Xinhua News Agency reports: Reporter Liu Guilian reports: Reforming the traditional evaluation method, relying on scientific testing methods to classify and grade products, the Light Industry Department has recently introduced this method for evaluating product quality. The testing situation and grading results of 26 brands of refrigerators from designated refrigerator manufacturers have been recently published in the first issue of this year's "Consumer Guide."

	The results of this test, conducted by the China Household Electrical Appliances Industry Quality Testing Center according to international standards, are divided into four grades based on comprehensive indicators: 21 are A-grade, 4 are B-grade, and 1 is C-grade. The quality grades of A, B, C, and D represent excellent, good, general, and usable, respectively. The test items include safety performance, appearance, assembly quality, cooling speed, noise, power consumption, and more than ten other items. The Light Industry Department first started with refrigerators, which have a higher starting point in terms of adopting international standards, production technology, and quality level. After the first batch of test results is published, the second batch will be published. Subsequently, washing machines, electric fans, bicycles, pianos, food, and other products will be tested, and the results will be published in sequence. From the date the test results are published, the relevant departments of the Light Industry Department will implement the "support the excellent, restrict the inferior" measures. For refrigerator compressors, a graded supply will be implemented: A-grade products will be fully supplied, B-grade will be supplied at 75%–80%, C-grade at 65%, and D-grade at 50%–60%. Products that do not meet the grade will not be supplied at all.

    轻工部公布首批质量测试结果
    本报讯  记者刘桂莲报道：改革传统的评优办法，依靠科学的检测手段对产品实行分类分级，轻工部这一评价产品质量的办法最近出台。第一批电冰箱定点厂家的２６个牌号的电冰箱测试情况及分级结果，最近公布在今年第一期《消费指南》上。
    这次由中国家用电器工业质量检测中心按国际标准检测的结果，其综合指标分为四等，Ａ级的有２１个，Ｂ级的４个，Ｃ级的１个。质量等级的Ａ、Ｂ、Ｃ、Ｄ，分别表示优等、良好、一般、可用，其测试项目包括安全性能、外观、装配质量、制冷速度、噪声、耗电量等十几项。轻工部首先从采用国际标准、生产技术和质量水平起点较高的电冰箱开始，第一批测试结果公布之后，还将公布第二批。继之还将检测洗衣机、电风扇、自行车、钢琴、食品等产品，并陆续公布。从测试结果公布之日起，轻工部有关部门将贯彻“扶优限劣”措施，对电冰箱压缩机实行分级供应，Ａ级产品将满足供应，Ｂ级供应７５％—８０％，Ｃ级供应６５％，Ｄ级５０％—６０％，不够级别的一台也不供应。
