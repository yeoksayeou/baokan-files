	Wuyi in the Rain and Mist
	Gentle breezes play a melody
	Swirling clouds dance
	In the profound silence, they roll
	Mountains float in the sky
	Tree shadows like fairies descending
	Speaking of the clear shallow waters of Penglai
	As if seeing the giant whales of the sea
	Playing with the waves, deeply green
	In lovers' eyes, the light shimmers
	Stepping onto the stone steps
	Petals of pear blossoms fall to the ground
	Dripping with rain, like tears
	Pure and spotless
	Reluctant to tread upon
	Everything is gentle
	Everything is moist

	Wuyi's Peach Blossom Spring
	No broken tablets record the colorful dreams
	In the dense shade, the water flows gently
	Rolling dust cannot reach
	The fairyland should be like this
	Peach blossoms hang on the branches, cold as the moon on the jade terrace
	Ancient trees surround the new halls and old sites
	In quiet places, observe the universe in a pot
	Even loneliness has its charm
	Thousand-year wars
	Hundred-year turmoil
	The world loses its color
	How can it compare to admiring the red robes on the Longevity Rock?
	Chewing on silence in the spring breeze
	Walking through the flower paths in the mist

　　武夷二首
　　蔡其矫
    雨雾武夷
    柔风乐章
    旋卷的云丝
    于万籁沉沉里滚动
    山在空中飘飞
    树影是仙姑款款来时
    说起蓬莱清清浅水
    似乎看见了大海巨鲸
    播弄云涛酽酽地绿
    爱人眼中浮光潋滟
    步上阶石
    地面的梨花落瓣
    经雨点点似泪
    净洁无瑕
    不忍心踩踏
    一切盈盈
    一切濡湿
    　　　　武夷桃花源
    没有一块残碑记载彩梦
    浓荫中隐隐有潺湲流水
    黄尘滚滚难到
    仙境应当如是
    桃花在枝梢挂着冷冷瑶台月
    古树围绕新殿旧址
    静处看壶天
    寂寞也有可爱时
    千古征战
    百年动乱
    天地失色
    何如贪看红妆在寿岩上
    咀嚼寂静在春风中
    踏遍花径在烟雾里
