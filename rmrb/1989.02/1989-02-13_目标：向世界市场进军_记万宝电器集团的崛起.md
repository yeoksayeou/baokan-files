On the banks of the Pearl River, a bright star has risen in recent years—Guangzhou Wanbao Enterprise Group. Seven years ago, it was a struggling enterprise with only 300 people and a mountain of debt. Today, it has joined the ranks of the world's top eight producers of refrigerators, with an annual output of over a million units. In 1988, its output value was 2.4 billion yuan, taxes and profits were 400 million yuan, and foreign exchange earnings exceeded 100 million US dollars. With nearly 100 product varieties, Wanbao's profits, foreign exchange earnings, and refrigerator production volume have been at the top of the national electrical appliance industry for five consecutive years. The quality of its refrigerators has won the national silver award. A Japanese expert exclaimed that Wanbao's rise was like an "explosion."

Wanbao is a collective enterprise. It did not have the advantages of state funding and investment, and could be said to have been born into poverty and with congenital deficiencies. How did it manage to overcome its difficulties and achieve such rapid development? Those familiar with the situation say that Wanbao's experience lies first in the importance it places on team building, starting its reforms from there.

	(I)

In July 1981, the new leadership team led by General Manager Deng Shaosheng fired the first shot of reform by breaking the system of lifelong tenure for cadres, implementing a policy of promoting the capable, retaining the competent, and dismissing the incompetent, and removing those who violate discipline. Cadres from top to bottom were appointed in a tiered manner, with employment contracts clearly defining the terms of employment and the rights and responsibilities of the appointees. They were the first to break away from the "big pot of rice" and "iron rice bowl," implementing an economic responsibility system at the factory, workshop, and individual levels. Production volume, quality, cost, and unit consumption were used as the main assessment indicators, broken down layer by layer, and each person was responsible for their own share. In terms of distribution, they created a tiered system.

This method, once implemented, was like throwing a stone into water, immediately causing waves. Those accustomed to eating from the "big pot of rice" grumbled and complained, but Deng Shaosheng and his comrades stood firm and persisted with the reforms. Before long, those who were not used to it calmed down, and production quickly improved. That year, they finally shed the hat of long-term losses and achieved a profit of 1.04 million yuan for the first time.

	(II)

As the enterprise's production developed and the market for refrigerators opened up, everyone was overjoyed. But Deng Shaosheng saw and thought about something else. At that time, although there were 40 refrigerator factories nationwide, only a few could produce in batches, with an annual output of only 60,000 units. The domestic market demand for refrigerators was increasing daily, and foreign refrigerators were pouring in. He felt uneasy, thinking, "It's better to buy the chicken than the eggs," and he had the idea of importing.

Opportunities come to those who seek them, and those who are alert seize them. A company in Singapore wanted to sell a used refrigerator production line with an annual capacity of 50,000 units for 1 million US dollars. The news came, but other domestic refrigerator factories dared not buy it. Deng Shaosheng decided to buy it. He then bought another new refrigerator production line from Japan. At that time, there was no precedent for refrigerator factories in China to import production lines from abroad. This collective enterprise borrowed money to import two lines, operating with debt, either rolling in interest or rolling in debt. To take such a big risk, one indeed needs courage!

As soon as the equipment arrived, the leaders moved their belongings into the factory, leading technicians and workers to install the equipment day and night in shifts. Deng Shaosheng and another deputy manager both collapsed from exhaustion on the spot. With this spirit of struggle, they completed the installation of the production line in just 8.5 months. In the first year, they produced 70,000 refrigerators, repaying all the investment and even making some profit. In 1984, the entire factory produced 144,000 refrigerators, accounting for one-third of the national total, instantly becoming the largest refrigerator production base in the country.

	(III)

In March 1985, a storm of criticism over the quality of Wanbao refrigerators suddenly erupted, dealing a huge blow to the company. But Wanbao did not collapse; instead, it used social criticism as a driving force, stopping production for three months to rectify the situation, significantly improving product quality, and regaining the trust of users. In this "Wanbao Incident," they realized a truth: talent is the wings of an enterprise's flight. Previously, Wanbao's fatal weakness was its lack of technical strength, with only seven technical personnel, including assistant engineers. What to do? Wanbao made another strategic decision: to recruit talent from society. For the recruited technical personnel, they were given important tasks at work and were fully trusted; in life, they were cared for in every way. The new technical cadres quickly developed a sense of belonging to the company, working day and night while spreading the word that they had found their ideal employer. Thus, letters of application poured in from all over the country, and Wanbao began to continuously attract talented people. Over the years, they recruited 300 technical personnel with professional titles, plus university graduates and their own trained technical and management personnel with college-level education, forming a technical team of over a thousand people. They made a decisive contribution to Wanbao's development. This is another experience of Wanbao's rise.

	(IV)

Deng Shaosheng was not satisfied with the status quo. He and his partners analyzed the international market situation: currently, the global consumption of home appliances is 100 billion US dollars annually, with Southeast Asia alone importing 5 billion US dollars worth of products each year. However, China's home appliance exports are less than 2 billion US dollars, accounting for only 0.2% of the global consumption and 4% of Southeast Asia's consumption. This figure is extremely unworthy of such a large country as China. The large-scale industrial restructuring of the 1980s provided a good opportunity for China's home appliances to enter the international market. If we only focus on the current domestic market boom and miss the opportunity, we will make a strategic mistake.

A new, more daring strategic plan was placed on the agenda of Deng Shaosheng and other entrepreneurs.

In the autumn of 1987, Deng Shaosheng and Manager Mai Shaofang of Guangzhou Light Industry Electrical Appliances Company went to Australia for business negotiations. The manager of an American multinational trading company expressed his willingness to promote Guangzhou's electrical appliances, initially agreeing to sell 500,000 refrigerators and washing machines each year for four years, plus electric fans, televisions, tape recorders, rice cookers, and other products. But the foreign businessmen proposed that the home appliances should be fully matched, use a single brand, and have unified advertising, sales channels, and after-sales service.

The foreign businessmen's requirements matched the thoughts of the two managers. Indeed, if we could gather and unite various export products such as Guangzhou Wanbao refrigerators, Gaobao washing machines, Moxing tape recorders, Zhuanshi electric fans, and Shengfeng air conditioners into a series of products, wouldn't we be able to change the image of Guangzhou's electrical appliances in the international market, increase brand awareness, and enhance our external strength?

In the spring of 1988, Deng Shaosheng, Mai Shaofang, and a few "giants" in the Guangzhou electrical appliance industry gathered to jointly establish the Wanbao Electrical Appliances Group.

Thus, an army of 40 enterprises and 30,000 elite soldiers stood up!

The financial sector supported them, with many banks actively participating in the financial company of the Wanbao Group. The scientific and technological community also stood behind them. The Wanbao Industrial Design Institute, jointly established by Wanbao Company and Guangzhou University, had already been set up; the Wanbao Electronic Technology Development Center, dedicated to developing home appliance products, had also been established...

When talking about the establishment of the group, someone asked Deng Shaosheng: Wanbao Company's output value in 1987 was 700 million yuan, with export earnings of 41 million US dollars and profits of 1.1 billion yuan. Life was getting better and better, so why bother to establish an enterprise group and create trouble for yourself? Deng Shaosheng said, "We should not be concerned with the gains and losses of a single refrigerator factory, but should strive to make Guangzhou's series of electrical appliance products go global and establish China's position on the world economic stage. This is the goal we pursue."

Deng Shaosheng's words expressed the aspirations of many patriotic entrepreneurs in China today.

　　目标：向世界市场进军   
     ——记万宝电器集团的崛起
    本报记者  李茜
    珠江之滨，近年间升起一颗耀眼的“明星”——广州万宝企业集团。７年前，它还是个只有３００多人，负债累累的困难户，如今已跻身年产百万台电冰箱的世界８强行列。１９８８年产值２４亿元，税利４亿元，创汇１亿多美元，品种近百个。利润、创汇和电冰箱产量，已连续５年居我国家电行业首位，冰箱质量获国家银质奖。一位日本专家赞叹万宝的崛起是“爆炸”速度。
    万宝是个集体企业，它没有国家拨款、投资等优越条件，可说是出身贫穷，先天不足。它是怎样摆脱困境，取得飞速发展的呢？了解情况的人说，万宝的经验，第一条就是重视队伍建设，改革首先从这里入手。
    　　　　（一）
    １９８１年７月，以总经理邓绍深为首的新领导班子改革的第一炮就是打破干部的终身制，实行能者上，称职者留，不称职者免，违纪者撤的用人制度。干部从上到下实行逐级聘用，以签订聘用合同的形式，明确聘用期限和受聘人的责权利。他们率先打破“大锅饭”、“铁饭碗”，在厂、车间和个人间，层层实行经济责任制，把产量、质量、成本、单耗作为主要考核指标，层层分解，个个承包，在分配上拉开档次。
    这套办法一实行，犹如投石下水，顿时激起层层波澜，习惯于吃“大锅饭”的人们吵吵嚷嚷，邓绍深和他的伙伴们顶住了这股风，坚持改革。没有多久，不习惯的人平静下来，生产迅速好转，这年一举摘掉了多年亏损的帽子，首次盈利１０４万元。
    　　　　（二）
    企业生产发展，冰箱销路打开，人人春风满面。但邓绍深看到的和思考的却是另一回事。当时全国虽有４０家冰箱厂，能批量生产的不过几家，年产量只有６万台，国内市场对冰箱需求量日增，眼看外国冰箱源源进口，他心中很不是滋味，“买蛋不如买鸡”，他萌生了引进的念头。
    人在找机会，机会也在找人，麻木者往往使机会失之交臂，清醒者却抓住机会，时来运转。新加坡有一家公司要以１００万美元报价卖掉年产５万台的一条旧冰箱生产线，消息传来，国内别的电冰箱厂不敢买，邓绍深果断地买了下来。接着又买了日本另一条新冰箱生产线。当时我国冰箱厂从国外引进生产线尚无先例，这个集体企业一下贷款引进两条，负债经营，不是利滚利，就是债滚债，担这样大的风险，确实要有胆略！
    设备一到货，领导干部们就把行李搬进工厂，带领技术人员和工人日夜不停地轮番安装，邓绍深和另一位副厂长累得先后晕倒在现场。就凭这股拚劲，只用８个半月时间，这条生产线就建成投产，头一年生产了７万台电冰箱，偿还全部投资，还赚了些钱。１９８４年全厂生产电冰箱１４．４万台，占全国冰箱总产量的１／３，一跃而为全国最大的冰箱生产基地。
    　　　　（三）
    １９８５年３月，一场批评万宝冰箱质量的风波骤起，使公司受到巨大的冲击，但万宝没有垮掉，而是以社会批评为动力，停产整顿了３个月，使产品质量显著提高，重新得到用户的信任。在这次“万宝事件”中，他们悟出了一个道理：人才是企业腾飞的翅膀。过去，万宝的致命的弱点正是技术力量薄弱，当时包括助理工程师在内只有７名技术人员。怎么办？万宝公司作出了又一战略决策：向社会广揽人才。对招聘来的科技人员工作上委以重任，放手使用；生活上关怀备至。新来的技术干部很快对公司产生了视如家人的情感，一面夜以继日地工作，一面奔走相告，说他们幸遇伯乐。于是，一封封应聘信从全国各地飞来，万宝从此源源不断获得各路贤才，几年间共调进有职称的技术人员３００人，加上招收的大学毕业生，以及本企业培养的具有大专文化水平的技术、管理人才，形成了一支千人以上的技术队伍，他们对万宝的发展作出了决定性贡献。这是万宝崛起的又一经验。
    　　　　（四）
    邓绍深没有满足于现状。他同自己的伙伴们一起分析了国际市场的形势：目前全世界家电产品年消费量已达１０００亿美元，其中仅东南亚每年输入额就占５０亿美元，然而中国家电产品出口还不到２亿美元，仅占世界消费量的０．２％，占东南亚消费量的４％。这个数字与我国如此泱泱大国是极不相称的。８０年代世界规模的产业结构大调整，为我国家电产品进入国际市场提供了良机，如果只满足眼前国内市场的红火日子，失去时机，将会犯战略性的错误。
    一个新的更大胆的战略计划提到了邓绍深等企业家的工作日程上来。
    １９８７年秋季，邓绍深和广州二轻家电公司麦绍方经理去澳大利亚洽谈业务，美国一家跨国贸易公司经理表示愿意推销广州家电产品，初步洽商在４年内每年可推销电冰箱、洗衣机各５０万台，另外还有电风扇、电视机、录音机、电饭煲等等。但外商提出，家电产品要配套齐全，用一个牌号，以便统一广告，统一销售渠道，统一售后服务。
    外商的要求与两位经理的想法不谋而合。是啊，如果把广州万宝电冰箱、高宝洗衣机、摩星收录机、钻石电扇、胜风空调……各种出口产品集结、联合起来，形成一个系列产品集团，不是可以改变广州家电在国际市场上的形象、提高知名度和增强外向实力吗？
    １９８８年春，邓绍深、麦绍方和广州家电行业的几个“巨头”聚会，联合组建起万宝电器集团。
    从此，一个包括４０家企业、３万精兵强将的“集团军”就这样站起来了！
    金融界支持他们，多家银行踊跃参加万宝集团的财务公司。科技界也愿作他们的后盾，万宝公司和广州大学合办的万宝工业设计院已经成立；专门开发家电产品的万宝电子技术开发中心也已建立……
    谈到组建集团，曾有人问邓绍深：万宝公司１９８７年产值已达７亿元，出口创汇４１００万美元，利润１．１亿元，日子越过越红火，何必组建什么企业集团，自找麻烦呢？邓绍深说，我们不应计较一个电冰箱厂的得失，而应当使广州家电系列产品走向世界，确立起中国在世界经济舞台上的地位，这才是我们追求的目标。
    邓绍深的话，表达了当今中国许多爱国企业家的胸怀。
