Cultural relics from the Neolithic Age have been unearthed in caves in Benxi County, Liaoning Province, by local archaeologists. This discovery indicates that the primitive residents of the Liaodong region were living in caves as early as 5,000 years ago.

The Neolithic relics found in the caves are all located beneath the layer of the Bronze Age cremation site. At the entrance of the cave in Jinbian Temple, a circular dwelling was discovered. Inside the dwelling, there is a square hearth, and around the hearth, stone axes, pottery, stone net sinkers, and simple vessels with impressed and carved patterns were found. In the Bat Cave of Machengzi and the Triangle Cave of Beidian, agricultural and fishing tools such as jade axes, jade chisels, jade carving knives, fish hooks, fish spears, and stone net sinkers were also unearthed.

More notably, in the caves of the vast mountainous region of Liaodong, not only were overlapping layers of the Bronze Age and Neolithic Age discovered, but artifacts from the Paleolithic, Neolithic, and Bronze Age were also found in the same cave, representing three different historical periods.

　　五千年前辽东居民在洞穴内建有居室
　　本溪发现新石器时代文化遗址
    据新华社沈阳２月７日电  （记者李永宏、通讯员李恭笃）辽宁省文物考古工作者在本溪县的马城子、近边寺、北甸村等地的洞穴中，发掘出新石器时代的文化遗存，这一发现说明辽东地区早在５０００年前，原始居民就在洞穴内建有居室。
    在洞穴内出土的新石器时代的遗迹遗物，均叠压在青铜文化的火葬基地层之下。在近边寺下洞的洞口处，发现一处圆形居室，室内有方形灶址，灶址四周有石斧、陶、石网坠和饰有压印、刻划纹的简形器皿。在马城子蝙蝠洞和北甸三角洞中，还出土有玉斧、玉凿、玉刻刀和鱼标、鱼叉、石网坠等农业、渔猎工具。
    更值得提及的是，在辽东广阔山区的洞穴中，不仅发现了青铜时代与新石器时代的叠压地层，还发现旧石器新石器青铜时代３个不同历史时期的遗物出于同一个洞穴。
