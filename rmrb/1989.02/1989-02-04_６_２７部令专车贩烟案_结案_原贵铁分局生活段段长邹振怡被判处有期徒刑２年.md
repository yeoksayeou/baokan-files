The "June 27th Departmental Order Special Train Tobacco Smuggling Case" has concluded. The former section chief of the Guizhou Railway Bureau Living Section, Zhou Zhenyi, has been sentenced to two years in prison.

Our reporter, Pan Di Du and Hu Yue Ping, report from Guiyang on February 3rd: The highly anticipated "June 27th Departmental Order Special Train Tobacco Smuggling Case" has finally seen its key figures in Guizhou dealt with. On the afternoon of the day before yesterday, the President of the Guizhou Provincial Higher People's Court, Xie Jinhan, announced the handling results of the case at a press conference.

The "June 27th Departmental Order Special Train Tobacco Smuggling Case" occurred in late June 1987 (as previously reported by our newspaper). After more than a year and a half of thorough investigation and trial by Guizhou's judicial authorities, the following verdicts have been reached:

The defendant, former section chief of the Guizhou Railway Bureau Living Section, Zhou Zhenyi, from February 1985 to June 1987, directed and supported his commercial service department manager, Wang Tao, and station service department manager, Gao Zhongren (both of whom have already been sentenced to prison), to use the living supply cars of the section to purchase various types of cigarettes in bulk from the Guizhou Tobacco Sales Department and other places, totaling 575,000-plus sticks. These cigarettes were then transported to Chengdu and other places using the Guizhou Railway Living Section's living supply cars numbered 608472 and 600212, and sold at local retail prices, with a total business volume of 3,517,000-plus yuan, earning a profit of 411,000-plus yuan. Additionally, he shared illegal profits of 123,000-plus yuan with others. The total illegal gains amounted to 534,000-plus yuan. Although Zhou Zhenyi did not personally embezzle the profits, his actions constituted the crime of speculation and profiteering, for which he was sentenced to two years in prison. The illegal profits from the Living Management Section's tobacco smuggling, after deducting the taxes and other fees that were paid, were fully confiscated.

The defendant, former veterinarian of Jizixi Township, Jiangjin County, Sichuan Province, Chen Zhixing, stopped receiving his salary in early 1985 and opened a store in Guiyang to sell tobacco, alcohol, food, and daily necessities. Starting in March 1986, Chen collaborated with the Guizhou Railway Living Section's procurement station and commercial service department. Chen, through the manager of Guiyang City Tobacco Sales Station No. 7, Peng Gengyin, and the Dushan Tobacco Company, purchased large quantities of "Jiaxiu" cigarettes on credit. The Guizhou Railway Living Section provided living supply special trains to transport the cigarettes to Chengdu for sale, earning a profit of 247,000-plus yuan. Chen personally gained a net profit of 99,000-plus yuan. During the period of illegal tobacco smuggling, Chen Zhixing bribed Peng Gengyin and the party branch secretary of Tobacco Sales Station No. 7, Liao Renyu, and the accountant Zhang Xiaoxia, a total of 100,000-plus yuan on three separate occasions. Chen Zhixing was sentenced to two years in prison for speculation and profiteering and one year in prison for bribery, with a total sentence of two years and six months. Peng Gengyin's actions constituted the crime of accepting bribes, but since he returned the bribe money before the case was exposed, he was exempted from criminal punishment.

　　“６·２７部令专车贩烟案”结案
　　原贵铁分局生活段段长邹振怡被判处有期徒刑２年
    本报贵阳２月３日电  记者潘帝都、胡跃平报道：令人关注的“６·２７部令专车贩烟案”在贵州的有关人员终被处理。前天下午，贵州省高级人民法院院长谢锦汉在新闻发布会上公布了对该案的处理结果。
    “６·２７部令专车贩烟案”发生于１９８７年６月下旬（本报已报道），案发后，贵州司法部门经过１年半多的认真查证、审理，已作如下判决：
    被告人，原贵铁分局生活段段长邹振怡，于１９８５年２月至１９８７年６月，指使和支持其商业服务部经理汪涛、站前服务部经理高中仁（均已分别判处徒刑）等人，利用该段生活供应车多次从贵州烟草销售部等处，以批发价套购各类卷烟５７．５万余条，用贵铁生活段６０８４７２号、６００２１２号生活供应车运往成都等地，以当地零售价进行销售，经营额达３５１．７万余元，获利４１．１万余元。此外，还与他人联营中分得非法利润１２．３万余元。总共牟利５３．４万余元。邹振怡获利后虽未中饱私囊，但已构成投机倒把罪，判处其有期徒刑２年。生活管理段贩烟所获非法利润，扣除上交的税金等费用外，所余赃款全部予以追缴。
    被告人、原四川省江津县几子乡兽医陈治行，１９８５年初停薪留职后，同年到贵阳办执照，开设门面经营烟、酒、副食、日杂等。从１９８６年３月起，陈与贵铁生活段采购站、商业服务部联营，由陈出面通过贵阳市烟批七站站长彭庚寅以及独山烟草公司等单位，赊购大量“甲秀”卷烟，由贵铁生活段提供生活供应专车，运往成都销售，获利２４．７万余元。陈实得纯利９．９万余元。在非法贩烟期间，陈治行先后３次向彭庚寅和烟批七站党支部书记廖仁玉、会计张小霞行贿１万余元。陈治行被以投机倒把罪判处徒刑２年，行贿罪判处徒刑１年，决定执行２年零６个月。彭庚寅的行为已构成受贿罪，鉴于案发前主动退还了赃款，免予刑事处分。
