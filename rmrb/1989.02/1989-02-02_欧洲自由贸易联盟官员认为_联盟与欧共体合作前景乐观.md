European Free Trade Association officials believe that the prospects for cooperation between the association and the European Community are optimistic.

New China News Agency, Geneva, January 31st: The director of the European Free Trade Association's press office, Hans-Jörg Rink, stated on the 30th that he is optimistic about the prospects for cooperation between the association and the European Community.

Rink told a New China News Agency reporter that the Community's proposal to strengthen cooperation between the two economic organizations in Western Europe essentially aims to make the European Free Trade Association a legal institution that serves as one of the two pillars of this cooperation, and to assure the member states of the Community that the agreements they sign with the Association will be respected and implemented.

He said that the European Free Trade Association will discuss the European Community's proposal at the upcoming summit of the association's member states' heads of government, which will be held in Oslo in mid-March. The secretary-general of the European Free Trade Association, Gerk Reisch, is currently making full preparations for this summit.

Rink said that it is too early to make predictions about the outcome of this summit. However, regarding whether the European Free Trade Association will give a positive response to the Community's proposal, Rink himself is optimistic.

　　欧洲自由贸易联盟官员认为
    联盟与欧共体合作前景乐观
    新华社日内瓦１月３１日电  欧洲自由贸易联盟新闻处处长汉斯约格·伦克３０日表示，他对联盟与欧洲共同体的合作前景是乐观的。
    伦克在对新华社记者发表谈话时说，共同体就加强西欧两个经济组织之间合作提出的建议，其实质是使自由贸易联盟具有成为这种合作两大支柱之一的法律机构，使共同体成员国确信它们同联盟签订的协定能得到遵守和执行。
    他说，自由贸易联盟将于３月中旬在奥斯陆举行的联盟成员国政府首脑会议，将讨论欧洲共同体提出的建议。自由贸易联盟秘书长格尔克·赖施目前正全力以赴地为这次首脑会议作准备。
    伦克说，对于这次会议的结果，目前发表预言尚为时过早。但是，对于自由贸易联盟是否将对共同体的建议作出肯定的答复，伦克本人持乐观态度。
