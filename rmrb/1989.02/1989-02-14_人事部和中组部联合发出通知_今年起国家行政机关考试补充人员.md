The Ministry of Personnel and the Central Organization Department of the Communist Party of China recently jointly issued the "Notice on the Implementation of Examination Methods for Supplementing Personnel in State Administrative Agencies." It was decided that starting from 1989, the supplementation of personnel in state administrative agencies will adhere to the principles of openness, equality, and competition, and will be conducted through examinations and assessments to select the best candidates. This will ensure that the "entrance" is strictly controlled and create conditions for the future implementation of the national civil service examination and recruitment system.

The "Notice" points out that in accordance with the principles and requirements of organizational reform and cadre structure adjustment, the supplementation of personnel in county-level and above administrative agencies must first be adjusted within the administrative agencies. Only when internal adjustments cannot solve the problem should external supplementation through examinations be considered. The supplementation of personnel must be carried out within the established staffing and annual increase plans.

The "Notice" also points out that the positions to be supplemented through examinations are currently limited to non-leadership positions in administrative agencies. The main sources of supplementation are cadres outside administrative agencies. A small number of positions with special needs can also be supplemented from graduates of national unified allocation programs, including graduate students and undergraduates. The supplementation of personnel through examinations should, in principle, be resolved locally.

The "Notice" stipulates that the types of examinations are divided according to the cultural requirements for applicants; the examination methods include written tests and interviews. The written test content includes basic knowledge common to agencies and necessary professional knowledge for the work, while the interview content can be determined based on the specific requirements of the intended job. The basic procedures for the examination are: issuing announcements, open registration, qualification review, organizing written tests and interviews, physical examinations, assessments, determining qualified candidates, approving recruitment, and publicizing the results. The examination work of central and local state administrative agencies will be respectively managed by central ministries and commissions and local provincial personnel departments. Each examination authority should establish a temporary supervisory body, inviting social representatives or social organization representatives to participate, to strengthen the supervision of the examination work. For those who have been recruited through the examination, their original units should allow them to leave. Disputes will be arbitrated by the personnel departments of various levels of government or their talent exchange centers.

　　人事部和中组部联合发出通知    
    今年起国家行政机关考试补充人员
    本报讯  人事部、中共中央组织部近日联合发出了《关于国家行政机关补充工作人员实行考试办法的通知》，决定从１９８９年起，国家行政机关补充工作人员，要贯彻公开、平等、竞争的原则，通过考试考核，择优录取，把好“进口”关，为今后全面推行国家公务员考试录用制度创造条件。
    《通知》指出，按照机构改革和干部结构调整的原则要求，县及县以上各级行政机关补充工作人员必须先在行政机关内部调整，确实解决不了的再通过考试进行补充。补充工作人员必须在编制定员和年度增人计划内进行。
    《通知》还指出，通过考试补充工作人员的岗位，目前暂为行政机关中的非领导职务。补充的来源主要是行政机关以外的在职干部。少数特别需要的，也可以从国家统一分配的毕业研究生和大中专毕业生中补充。通过考试补充工作人员，原则上就地解决。
    《通知》规定，考试种类按照对报考者文化条件的要求划分；考试方法为笔试、面试，笔试内容为机关通用的基础知识和工作必备的专业知识，面试内容可依据拟任工作岗位的具体要求来确定；考试的基本程序是发布公告、公开报名、资格审查、组织笔试和面试、体检、考核、确定合格者、审批录取和张榜公布。中央和地方国家行政机关的考试工作，分别由中央各部委和地方省级人事部门负责。各主考机关应成立临时性监督机构，吸收社会人士或社会组织代表参加，加强对考试工作的监督。凡经考试被录取的在职人员，原单位应予放行；有关争议问题，由各级政府人事部门或委托其人才交流中心仲裁。　　　　　（陆勇）
