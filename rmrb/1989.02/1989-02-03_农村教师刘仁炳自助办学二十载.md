Rural teacher Liu Renbing from Shengmi Township, Xingjian County, Jiangxi Province, has been running a school in his hometown since graduating from middle school more than twenty years ago. In recent years, he has become wealthy through his skills in catching snakes and treating snake bites, but he still lives frugally, donating over 4,000 yuan to build new classrooms. This has enabled all 60-plus school-age children in this remote mountain village to attend school. Over the past twenty years, Liu Renbing has cultivated more than 400 qualified primary school graduates and has also trained his eldest son to become a substitute teacher.

    农村教师刘仁炳自助办学二十载
    江西省新建县生米乡刘师村小学教师刘仁炳中学毕业后回乡办学已经二十多年了。近年来，他凭着一手捉蛇、治蛇伤的本领劳动致富，但仍节衣缩食，捐资四千多元盖了新校舍，使这个偏僻山村的六十多名适龄儿童全部入学。二十多年来，刘仁炳培养了四百多名合格的初小毕业生，还把自己的大儿子也培养成一名代课教师。（附图片）
