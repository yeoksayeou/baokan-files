Near 1,000 Cuban troops who withdrew from Angola arrived in Havana on February 3, thus completing ahead of schedule the task of withdrawing 3,000 troops before April 1.

According to the New York Agreement signed last December by Cuba, Angola, and South Africa, Cuba will begin withdrawing its 50,000 troops from Angola in batches starting April 1, with the process to be completed within 27 months. To show its sincerity in withdrawing troops, the Cuban government decided to withdraw 3,000 troops before that date. The first batch of Cuban troops withdrew from Angola on January 10.

These 1,000 Cuban troops were welcomed by high-ranking party, government, and military leaders upon their arrival at Havana Port.
