Japan's foreign trade surplus is showing signs of expansion.

	The People's Daily, Tokyo, February 4th - Japan's foreign trade saw significant growth in 1988. Although the trade surplus decreased, it is expected to continue expanding in the future.

	According to a report on international settlements released by Japan's Ministry of Finance, Japan's exports for the year amounted to $259.55 billion, while imports were $164.76 billion. Both figures represent increases of 15.6% and 28.5% respectively compared to the previous year. The trade surplus stood at $94.79 billion, a 1.7% decrease from the previous year.

	Due to the appreciation of the dollar against the yen, Japan's trade surplus began to recover in the fourth quarter of last year, reaching $10.9 billion in December. Experts predict that if the dollar-yen exchange rate remains at its current level, the trade surplus will expand once again.

	Japan's imports of manufactured goods increased by 39.2% last year, accounting for 49% of total imports, the highest level in history.

　　日本外贸顺差呈扩大趋势
    本报东京２月４日电  １９８８年日本的对外贸易取得较大增长。贸易顺差虽有所减少，但今后仍呈扩大的趋势。
    据日本大藏省发表的国际收支报告，去年日本的出口为２５９５．５亿美元，进口为１６４７．６亿美元，分别比前一年增长１５．６％和２８．５％。贸易顺差为９４７．９亿美元，比前年减少１．７％。
    由于美元对日元的汇价回升，去年第４季度起，日本的贸易顺差恢复增长趋势，１２月份贸易顺差达１０９亿美元。此间专家估计，如果美元对日元的比价继续保持目前水平，对外贸易顺差将再次扩大。
    日本去年的制成品进口增加３９．２％，占进口总额的４９％，创历史最高水平。
