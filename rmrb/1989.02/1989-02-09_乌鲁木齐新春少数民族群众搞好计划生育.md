During the Spring Festival, family planning workers at various levels in Urumqi braved the cold to visit minority households, offering condolences to those who had been recognized for their contributions to family planning.

Since July 1, 1988, Urumqi has implemented the interim regulations for minority family planning in the autonomous region for ethnic groups such as the Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Hui, Kyrgyz, Mongols, and Uzbeks. In just half a year, numerous advanced units and individuals in family planning have emerged. Over 5,000 minority couples in the city have voluntarily chosen to have only two children for life and have received "Family Planning Honor Certificates." In the Tian Shan District, where minorities are concentrated, the late marriage rate among minority youth reached 88.98% in 1988, and the contraception rate was 81.41%. The Xinjiang Song and Dance Troupe is a multi-ethnic performing arts group. Among the minority performers, 50% are under 35 years old. All 35 couples in the troupe have voluntarily complied with the requirements of the "Interim Regulations for Minority Family Planning in the Autonomous Region," choosing to have only two children for life, and have all received honor certificates.
