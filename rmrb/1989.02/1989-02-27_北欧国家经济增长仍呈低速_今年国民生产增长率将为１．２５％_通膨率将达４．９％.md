The economic growth in Nordic countries remains slow. This year's GDP growth rate is expected to be 1.25%, while the inflation rate is expected to reach 4.9%.

Our correspondent Guo Yaoming reports from Stockholm: According to a joint forecast by economists from the Nordic countries' industrial associations, the economies of the Nordic countries will continue to grow slowly over the next one or two years.

The report states that the GDP growth rate of the Nordic countries in 1986 was equal to the average growth rate of the European countries in the OECD, but since then, the actual growth rate of the Nordic countries has fallen to only half of the average growth rate of the European countries in the OECD, and even lower compared to the overall average of the OECD. In 1988, it was 1.75%, and it is expected that the GDP growth rate of the Nordic countries in 1989 will reach 1.25%.

The report believes that the main reason for the slow economic development of the Nordic countries is that high inflation has weakened their international competitiveness, making all these countries face difficulties in international payments. It is expected that the average inflation rate in the Nordic countries in 1989 will reach 4.9%, higher than the OECD's average of 3.8%. In 1989, total investment in the region will decline significantly, and private consumption will increase.

The economic development of the Nordic countries varies. Denmark, Iceland, and Norway are facing a decline in domestic demand, slow growth in production and employment. Sweden and Finland are facing problems such as labor shortages and overheated labor markets.

The report points out that another common problem facing most Nordic countries is that the public sector is too large, and the government's burden is too heavy. Due to the high proportion of taxes to GDP, it has already affected the efficiency of the market, prices, and private enterprises. The public sector has many serious problems due to lack of competition, excessive concentration, and poor management. To solve these problems, the Nordic countries are discussing measures to reduce control over the public sector, privatize, and charge for services.

　　北欧国家经济增长仍呈低速
    今年国民生产增长率将为１．２５％　通膨率将达４．９％
    本报斯德哥尔摩２月２４日电  记者顾耀铭报道：据北欧国家工业协会经济学家联合预测，今后一两年，北欧国家的经济仍将呈现缓慢增长。
    预测报告说，北欧国家１９８６年的国民生产总值增长率同经合组织欧洲国家的平均增长率相等，但是从那以后北欧国家的实际增长率已下降到只及经合组织欧洲国家平均增长率的一半，同整个经合组织的平均水平相比更低，１９８８年为１．７５％，预计１９８９年北欧的国民生产总值增长率将达１．２５％。
    报告认为，北欧国家经济发展缓慢的主要原因是高通货膨胀率削弱了其国际竞争地位，使所有这些国家在国际支付方面遇到了困难。预计１９８９年北欧的平均通货膨胀率将达４．９％，高于经合组织３．８％的平均数。１９８９年该地区的总投资将大幅度下降，私人消费将增加。
    北欧国家经济发展情况各不相同。丹麦、冰岛和挪威正面临国内需求下降、生产和就业增长缓慢。瑞典和芬兰正面临着劳动力不足、劳务市场过热等问题。
    报告指出，北欧多数国家面临的另一个共同问题是公共部门发展过于庞大，政府负担过重。由于税收占国民生产总值比例太高，已经影响了市场、物价和私人企业的有效率。公共部门大多由于缺乏竞争、过分集中和管理不善而出现了一些严重问题。为了解决这些问题，北欧各国都在讨论对公共部门减少控制、私营化和收费服务等措施。
