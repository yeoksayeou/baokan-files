Date: 1989-02-15
Edition: 1

The collection of works by Li Xiannian has been published by the People's Publishing House and will be available in bookstores across the country starting February 15.

The collection was compiled under the guidance of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, edited by the former Central Secretariat Research Office, and reviewed, proofread, and annotated by the Central Archives Research Office.

This collection includes 94 important works by Li Xiannian from June 1935 to February 1988, with 75 of them being published for the first time. These works document the author's major revolutionary practices over more than half a century and his important views and insights on politics, military affairs, economics, and other aspects. The collection's fundamental characteristic is its adherence to the principles of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, applying them to revolutionary and construction practices.

The content of this collection can be roughly divided into three periods based on historical progress and the author's experiences:

1. During the revolutionary war years, the author engaged in arduous struggles and gained rich experiences in building the people's army, establishing and consolidating revolutionary base areas, implementing the united front against Japanese aggression, and independently and autonomously carrying out guerrilla warfare in enemy-occupied areas.

2. During his tenure as a major leader in Hubei Province and Wuhan City, and as an important leader in the Central South Region, the author closely combined his work with the actual situation of the region, correctly implemented the various policies and directives of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Central People's Government, and gained new experiences in political construction, economic development, and cultural education.

3. During his time working in the Central Committee, the author participated in the leadership of socialist transformation and socialist economic construction, proposed important views on planning, finance, banking, commerce, foreign trade, and other aspects; made unremitting efforts to overcome economic difficulties caused by mistakes in the Party's work; and proposed important views on guiding the Party to achieve a historic great turn and economic adjustment, reform, and opening up in the new historical period.

This collection reflects the author's adherence to the principle of seeking truth from facts and the spirit of continuous learning and summarizing experiences. The publication of this collection is of great significance for studying and summarizing the historical experiences of China's revolution and construction, and for promoting the development of China's socialist modernization and reform cause.
