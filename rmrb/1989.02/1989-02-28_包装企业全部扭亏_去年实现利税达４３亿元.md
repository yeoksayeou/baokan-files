Packaging Enterprises All Turn a Profit
Achieving Tax Revenue of 43 Billion Yuan in 1988

	BEIJING, Feb. 27 (Xinhua) -- Xinhua News Agency reporter Li Niangui and People's Daily reporter Mo Xinyuan learned from the China Packaging Corporation's managers and factory directors' meeting held in Beijing today that all enterprises under this corporation achieved profits in 1988, marking two consecutive years without any loss-making enterprises.

	The China Packaging Corporation, established in 1981, has transitioned from the investment phase to the production phase, achieving economic benefits. Currently, this corporation has become an integrated production and operation entity that encompasses talent cultivation, scientific research and development, industrial production, and coordinated internal and external trade. Last year, the national packaging industry's output value increased from 7.2 billion yuan in 1980 to 25 billion yuan, achieving a tax revenue of 4.3 billion yuan.

	The improved economic performance of packaging enterprises is a result of deepened reforms. In 1987, the entire corporation implemented a contract responsibility system. Each unit, based on its own circumstances, focused on transforming the operating mechanism, improving economic benefits, continuously improving the contract system and internal supporting reforms, and introducing a competitive mechanism into contract operations. The Chongqing Printing Factory No. 2, which had been losing money for a long time, turned a profit of 750,000 yuan after hiring a new director. The Zhejiang Packaging Color Printing Factory achieved a profit of over 620,000 yuan in the year the new director took office, far exceeding the contracted amount.

　　包装企业全部扭亏
    去年实现利税达４３亿元
    本报北京２月２７日讯  新华社记者李年贵、本报记者莫新元从今天在北京召开的中国包装总公司经理厂长工作会议上获悉，这家公司所属企业１９８８年又全部盈利，已连续两年没有亏损企业。
    １９８１年成立的中国包装总公司，已由投入阶段进入产出并获得经济效益的阶段。目前这个公司已成为从人才培养到科研开发，以工业生产为主，内外贸易相互配合的生产经营实体。去年全国包装工业产值已由１９８０年的７２亿元增加到２５０亿元，实现利税达到４３亿元。
    包装企业经济效益好是深化改革的结果。１９８７年全公司实行了承包责任制。各单位根据各自的实际，围绕转变经营机制，提高经济效益，不断完善承包制和内部配套改革，并把竞争机制引入承包经营。长期亏损的重庆印制二厂招聘厂长后当月扭转了亏损，全年盈利７５万元。浙江包装彩印厂招聘厂长上任的当年实现利润６２万多元，大大超过了承包基数。
