Li Peng says at a gathering with foreign senior experts that China will continue to introduce foreign technology and talent

    New China News Agency, Beijing, February 4 - (Reporter Zhang Rongdian) Premier Li Peng said today that during the process of rectifying the economic environment and order, China will continue to introduce foreign technology and talent.

    Li Peng made these remarks at a spring banquet held by the State Bureau of Foreign Experts for foreign senior experts in Beijing this evening.

    Li Peng said that at last year's Thirteenth Party Congress, the Third Plenary Session proposed the policy of rectifying the economic environment, improving economic order, and deepening reforms. After several months of effort, the situation of overheating economy, excessive investment in fixed assets, and rapid price increases has begun to change. Of course, the results are only preliminary, and the tasks are still quite arduous. We plan to use two years to improve the reform environment and social economic order.

    Li Peng emphasized, "We propose the policy of rectification and improvement to better reform and open up. In the process of rectification and improvement, China will continue to adhere to the policy of introducing foreign technology and talent to accelerate socialist modernization construction, and we will also strengthen this aspect of work to achieve greater benefits."

    The banquet was held at the Great Hall of the People. More than 30 senior experts from the United States, Britain, France, Canada, West Germany, Austria, Japan, Thailand, Malaysia, and other countries, who work in news, broadcasting, publishing, and higher education institutions in Beijing, were invited to attend the banquet. Among them were Epstein, Korok, Denise, Chauty Luxembourg, and Kawakoshi Toshitaka.

    At the banquet, Li Peng, when toasting, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, expressed heartfelt thanks and high respect to these experts for their valuable contributions and hard work over the past decades, sharing weal and woe with the Chinese people, for the birth of New China, for China's socialist revolution and construction, and for China's reform and opening up.

    Before the banquet, Premier Li Peng and his wife Zhu Lin, State Councilor Chen Junsheng, State Council Secretary-General Luo Gan, and relevant department heads met with the foreign senior experts and took a group photo.

　　李鹏同外国老专家欢聚时说
　　我国将继续引进国外技术和人才
    新华社北京２月４日电  （记者张荣典）国务院总理李鹏今天在这里说，在治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序的过程中，中国将继续引进国外技术和人才。
    李鹏是今晚在国家外国专家局为在京外国老专家举行的迎春宴会上说这番话的。
    李鹏说，在去年党的十三届三中全会上提出了治理经济环境，整顿经济秩序，深化改革的方针。经过这几个月的努力，经济过热、基建投资规模过大、物价上涨过快等情况开始有所改变。当然成效仅是初步的，任务还相当艰巨，我们准备用两年的时间使改革的环境和社会经济秩序得到改善。
    李鹏强调指出，“我们提出治理、整顿的方针，是为了更好地改革和开放。在治理、整顿中，我国将继续坚持引进国外技术和人才以加速社会主义现代化建设的方针，而且还要加强这方面的工作，使它取得更大的效益。”
    宴会是在人民大会堂举行的。在北京新闻、广播、出版等单位以及高等院校工作的来自美国、英国、法国、加拿大、联邦德国、奥地利、日本、泰国、马来西亚等国的３０多位老专家应邀出席了宴会，其中有爱泼斯坦、柯鲁克、戴妮丝、秋迪·卢森堡、川越敏孝等。
    李鹏在宴会上祝酒时，代表中共中央和国务院对这些专家几十年来同中国人民同甘共苦，为新中国的诞生，为中国的社会主义革命和建设，为中国的改革和开放所作出的可贵贡献和付出的辛勤劳动表示衷心的感谢，并致以崇高的敬意。
    宴会前，李鹏总理和他的夫人朱琳，国务委员陈俊生，国务院秘书长罗干及有关部门负责人会见了外国老专家，并同他们合影留念。
