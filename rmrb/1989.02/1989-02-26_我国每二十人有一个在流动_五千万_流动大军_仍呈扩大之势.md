	One in twenty people in China is on the move. The five million "floating population" continues to grow.

	According to a report from the Ministry of Public Security, the daily floating population in China's 23 cities with populations over one million has reached 10 million. Among these, Shanghai has 1.83 million, Beijing has 1.15 million, and Guangzhou has 1.1 million. The daily floating population in Xi'an is equivalent to the city's total population at the founding of the People's Republic. It is understood that three-quarters of the floating population are engaged in economic activities, with the majority working in construction, trade, services, repairs, and domestic work. Their stay in other places usually lasts more than three months.

	The increase in the floating population has promoted the development of the service industry and urban economic prosperity. Nowadays, in the streets and alleys of Beijing, one can often hear the cries of vendors from other provinces. Long-standing problems in big cities such as "difficulty in eating," "difficulty in repairs," and "difficulty in hiring domestic help" have been alleviated. In Guangzhou, the purchasing power of the floating population accounts for one-tenth of the city's total consumption, leading to the flourishing of hotels and restaurants.

	However, the floating population also brings a series of social problems to China's urban development. It places enormous pressure on urban transportation, water supply, and telecommunications. In Beijing alone, the daily number of passengers on public buses reaches 1.6 million, with each square meter accommodating nine people during peak hours. Beijing Railway Station handles an average of 200,000 passengers daily. Due to the rapid increase in the floating population, the supply of grain, vegetables, and other foodstuffs for urban residents has become tight, making urban life supplies appear strained.

	The floating population also introduces new elements of instability to urban security. Last year, over 50,000 transients were apprehended nationwide, accounting for one-thousandth of the total floating population. According to statistics from the Beijing Railway Station Police Station, more than 70% of the criminals operating there are from other provinces. In recent years, the rate of transient crimes in Guangzhou has increased by 40% annually.

	Experts believe that the growth of the urban floating population is an inevitable result of China's reform and opening up, as well as the development of a commodity economy. The series of social problems that arise from this should be given due attention by relevant authorities, and effective measures should be taken to address them.

### 我国每二十人有一个在流动  五千万“流动大军”仍呈扩大之势

　　我国每二十人有一个在流动
    五千万“流动大军”仍呈扩大之势
    本报讯  记者舒瑜报道：我国每二十人中就有一个在流动。全国五千万“流动大军”仍呈不断扩大的趋势。
    来自公安部的消息说，我国二十三个百万人口以上的大城市日均流动人口总量已达一千万。其中，上海一百八十三万，北京一百一十五万，广州一百一十万。西安的每日流动人口已相当于该市建国初期的人口总数。据了解，三分之二的流动人口从事经济活动，尤以务工、经商、服务修理、保姆等居多。在外地逗留时间一般在三个月以上。
    流动人口增多，促进了服务业的发展和城市经济繁荣。如今在北京的街头巷尾，经常可以听到外地口音商贩的叫卖声。大城市多年来的“吃饭难”、“修理难”、“请保姆难”等问题得到缓解。广州市流动人口的购买力相当于全市居民消费总额的十分之四，旅店餐馆随之蓬勃发展。
    流动人口也给我国城市发展带来一系列社会问题。它给城市交通、供水、邮电等增加巨大的压力。仅每天北京市公共汽车乘客量就有一百六十万人，乘车高峰时，车上每平方米要容纳九人。北京火车站日均流量为二十多万人次。由于流动人口剧增，目前城市居民对粮食、蔬菜和副食品的拥有量减少，城市居民生活供应显得紧张。
    流动人口还给城市治安带来新的不安定因素。去年，全国共抓获流窜案犯五万余人，相当于全国流动人口的千分之一。据北京火车站派出所统计，在这里作案的，百分之七十以上是外地来京人员。广州市近年来流窜犯罪活动以每年百分之四十的速度递增。
    有关专家认为，城市流动人口的增长，是中国改革开放和商品经济发展的必然结果，而随之出现的一系列社会问题也应引起有关方面的重视，并采取有效措施予以解决。
