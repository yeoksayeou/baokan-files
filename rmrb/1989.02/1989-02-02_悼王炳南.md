Title: In Memory of Wang Bingnan

Edition: 5

The end of the year brings sad news, and we weep for the loss of Mr. Bingnan.
The new brush of history writes with tears, and the old image remains in our eyes.
A brilliant scholar, at eighty, he was still a distinguished gentleman.
He crossed the ocean in search of righteousness, and fought against tigers and bears in their dens.
He traversed distant lands, his authority unyielding.
He befriended scholars from all over the world, his humility and integrity evident.
His heart was as pure as the sun and moon, his spirit as vast as the rainbow.
His lifelong regret was that he had not achieved great deeds.
Yet, his legacy will endure like gold and stone.

专栏：

　　悼王炳南
    岁暮传悲讯，痛哭失炳公。
    汗青新史笔，泪眼旧音容。
    好畤英才子，八旬倜傥翁。
    漂洋寻道义，入穴斗罴熊。
    纵横连远域，持节几折冲。
    广交天下士，情义自谦躬。
    丹心鉴日月，豪气贯长虹。
    平生头憾事，但有金石功。
    　　　　一九八八年岁末
