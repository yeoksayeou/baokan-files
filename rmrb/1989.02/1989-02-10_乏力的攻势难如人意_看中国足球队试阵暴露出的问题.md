A few months ago, the reporter wrote an article discussing how the Chinese football team had qualified for the Olympic finals but failed to score in three matches. At the beginning of the Year of the Snake, the team participated in the Lunar New Year Cup in Hong Kong. The opponents were not particularly strong, but the Chinese team drew both matches without scoring a single goal. It seems that the inability to break through the opponent's defense is a "perennial" problem for the Chinese team, and it is also a topic that the reporter can write about without it becoming outdated.

The two European teams the Chinese team faced in the Olympics were indeed stronger. In this Lunar New Year Cup, the Swedish team from Malmö did not perform at a level higher than the Chinese team, and the Danish team from Odense was even worse. Five years ago, they lost 0-4 to the Beijing team in the Great Wall Cup in Beijing. Just a few days ago, the Hong Kong team also won against them by two goals. The Chinese team's participation in this match was merely to warm up for the World Cup qualifiers, with no objective factors restricting them, and the opponents were not known for their aggressive, close-marking tactics. However, the Chinese team's performance only left fans with a familiar sense of disappointment.

In two matches, with over 20 shots on goal, only Wu Qunli's shot that hit the crossbar could be considered close, while the rest were mostly aimless shots. There were also a few good opportunities missed due to lack of decisive and powerful shooting. Remembering a famous player's words: "All efforts on the football field are for the purpose of scoring a goal." This speaks to the issue of shooting intent. Having the intent, does that solve the problem, or most of the problems? Not necessarily. The right tactics are the premise for creating shooting opportunities, and good shooting technique is the key to ultimately scoring. All of these need to be realized by the players on the field. After the Asian Cup final, the Chinese team adjusted its lineup and determined the basic formation for advancing to Rome. It seems that the problem of attack has not been resolved. Especially in the final stage of the attack, the last pass and shot are not sharp, there are many mistakes, and the threat is low. Wu Qunli's left-wing attack is relatively active, but Guo Yijun, when moved to the front, seems not yet in his role.

In recent years, the Chinese football team has emphasized defense, although efforts have been made in attack, it always feels like the attacking power is not as strong as in the previous two teams. Currently, there is no outstanding winger or striker on the front line. To strive for a place in the World Cup qualifiers, it is necessary to improve the quality and success rate of attacks. Whether facing the relatively weak Bangladesh and Thailand teams, or encountering strong teams like Iran, it is necessary to find a way through attacks. Otherwise, no matter how solid the defense, if you can't break through the opponent's goal, you can't qualify. That is to say, the article on breaking through the defense still needs to be written continuously.

　　乏力的攻势难如人意
　　——看中国足球队试阵暴露出的问题
    几个月前，记者曾写过一篇观感，谈的是中国足球队打进了奥运会决赛圈的大门，却打不开奥运会比赛的球门，三场比赛没踢进一球。蛇年之初，中国队在香港参加贺岁杯赛，对手并不怎么强，但中国队两战皆平，一球未得。看来，敲不开门真是中国队“永恒”的难题，也是记者作文章总不显得过时的题目。
    中国队在奥运会上遇到的两个欧洲对手，实力毕竟在中国队之上。这次贺岁杯赛，瑞典的马尔摩队表现的水平决不高于中国队，丹麦的奥登塞队更差，５年前曾在北京的长城杯赛上０∶４败给北京队，几天前香港队也赢了他们两个球。中国队此番出战只是为迎接世界杯预赛而热身，没有客观因素的制约，对手也并不擅长凶狠的贴身逼抢。但是，中国队的表现留给球迷的不过是以往许多次遗憾的重演。
    两场比赛，２０多次射门，大概仅有吴群立那一脚射中门楣，算是沾点边，其余多为没有目标的空炮，还有几个好机会失于射门不够果敢有力。记得一位著名球星有言：足球场上的一切努力都是为了破门。这说的是射门意识问题。有了意识是不是就能解决问题，或解决大部分问题呢？不见得。对头的战术是创造射门机会的前提，良好的射门脚法又是最终得分的关键。这些都要通过上场队员去实现。中国队在亚洲杯决赛后调整战将，确定了进军罗马的基本阵容，现在看来，进攻的问题还未处理好。特别是进攻的完成阶段，最后一脚传球和射门不犀利，失误多，威胁性差。吴群立的左路进攻比较活跃，而郭亿军摆到前场似乎尚未入角色。
    中国足球队这几年重视防守，进攻上虽然下了功夫，但总让人觉得没有前两届队伍攻击力强，目前锋线上没有一位技艺出众的边锋或中锋。中国队要争取世界杯外围赛出线，非提高进攻质量和成功率不可。不管遇到实力较弱的孟加拉国队和泰国队，还是碰上伊朗队或其他强队，都必须从进攻上找出路。不然，守得再牢，踢不开对方的大门，也无法出线。就是说，这破门的文章还要不断地作下去。
