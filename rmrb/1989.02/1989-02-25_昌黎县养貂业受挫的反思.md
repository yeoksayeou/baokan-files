In recent years, due to the popularity of mink fur in the international market, farmers have been enthusiastic about mink farming. By 1988, our county had 15,000 mink farming households, raising 650,000 mink, almost one per person. By the end of 1988, our county produced approximately 420,000 mink furs. However, due to market fluctuations, the county's foreign trade and supply and marketing departments only purchased 68,000 mink furs. The remaining 350,000 mink furs had to be sold by the farmers themselves. Despite the efforts of the mink farmers, the county still has 160,000 mink furs that have not been sold.

The average cost of raising one mink in 1988 was about 110 yuan. However, the average purchase price for each mink fur was 83 yuan. The price for mink furs sold independently ranged from 10 to 20 yuan, with the highest being 50 to 60 yuan. Some mink farmers worked hard all year but ended up in debt, which is truly regrettable.

Currently, our county's mink farming industry is on the brink of collapse. According to relevant departments, except for a few experienced mink farmers who kept some breeding mink, new mink farmers have almost all slaughtered their mink. The county now has only about 40,000 to 50,000 breeding mink left.

The lessons from the setbacks in our county's mink farming industry are painful and must be reflected upon.

Reflection One: Lack of Information and Blind Development. In 1985, after the state opened the livestock product market, the mink fur market was favorable due to the good international market conditions, making it profitable for traders. This led to a rush to buy mink furs in 1986, causing the purchase price of mink furs to skyrocket. As a result, many farmers sought to buy mink breeds and developed mink farming blindly. In 1986, the county's mink inventory was only 56,000, but it surged to 184,000 in 1987, leading to overheated mink farming.

Reflection Two: Increased Feed Costs and Decreased Purchase Prices Are Major Causes of Losses for Mink Farmers in Changli. Taking the main feed, fish meal, as an example, the price per 100 kilograms was 180 yuan in 1986, 300 yuan in 1987, and 460 yuan in 1988. Meanwhile, the purchase price for mink furs was 149 yuan per fur in 1986, 115 yuan per fur in 1987 (including bonus materials), and dropped to 83 yuan per fur in 1988. This increase and decrease have exacerbated the losses of mink farmers.

Reflection Three: Problems in Breeding Management Have Led to Poor Fur Quality and Low Prices. In 1988, out of the 15,000 mink farming households in our county, more than half were new farmers. They lacked breeding management techniques, from selecting mink breeds, breeding young mink, to raising them in cages, and processing the furs, they did not apply scientific technology sufficiently. Additionally, the sudden influx of mink breeds resulted in mixed quality and severe inbreeding, leading to breed degeneration and poor fur quality.

I believe that as long as the relevant departments in our county face reality and actively seek solutions, there is great hope for the mink farming industry to develop in a healthy manner.

Currently, the first step is to do a good job in propaganda to stabilize the emotions of mink farmers. Relevant departments should promptly release information on the dynamics and market trends of the mink farming industry to farmers, reduce blind development, and keep the mink farming industry at an appropriate scale. Secondly, focus on feed processing to stabilize feed prices and ensure the supply of mink feed. Thirdly, improve mink fur processing to increase the rate of high-quality fur products. Relevant departments should provide technical services for the entire process from selecting breeds, breeding, raising to harvesting furs, and enhance the competitiveness of mink furs in the international market.

Currently, mink farmers still have more than 100,000 mink furs that have not been sold. Relevant departments should also actively help mink farmers find buyers so that they can quickly sell their furs, repay loans and debts, shed their burdens, and move forward lightly.

Currently, there are 5 mink fur markets in our county and countryside, opened spontaneously by mink farmers, with hundreds of people waiting in the cold wind every day for buyers. The left image shows a corner of a free trade market in the county seat.

### 昌黎县养貂业受挫的反思

　　昌黎县养貂业受挫的反思
    近几年，由于貂皮在国际市场上走俏，刺激了农民养貂的积极性。到１９８８年，我县有养貂户１．５万户，饲养水貂６５万只，几乎全县人均１只。１９８８年底，我县共约生产貂皮４２万张。但是，由于市场变化，县外贸、供销部门只收购貂皮６．８万张。剩下的３５万多张貂皮全靠养貂户自寻销路。经养貂户努力推销，目前我县仍有１６万张貂皮销不出去。
    １９８８年饲养一只貂的平均成本约１１０元。而每张貂皮的平均收购价格为８３元。自行推销的貂皮价格每张低至一二十元，最高不过五六十元。有些养貂农民辛苦一年，到头来还背了一身债，确实令人同情。
    现在，我县的养貂业濒临崩溃的边缘。据有关部门调查，除少数老养貂户留下一点种貂外，新养貂户几乎把貂全部宰杀了。全县大约只剩下四五万只种貂。
    我县养貂业受挫的教训是沉痛的，不得不引起人们的反思。
    反思之一：信息不灵，盲目发展。１９８５年，国家开放畜产品市场后，由于当时国际市场的貂皮行情看好，经营者有利可图，引起了１９８６年的貂皮抢购风，使貂皮收购价格直线上升。于是，不少农民四处求购貂种，盲目发展。１９８６年全县貂的存栏数仅５．６万只，１９８７年猛增到１８．４万只，造成了养貂的过热现象。
    反思之二：饲料成本增加，收购价格下降，是造成昌黎养貂户亏损的重要原因。仅以主要饲料鱼粉为例，１９８６年每百公斤是１８０元，１９８７年涨到３００元，１９８８年又涨到４６０元。而貂皮的收购价格１９８６年平均每张１４９元，１９８７年加上奖售的物资，每张为１１５元，１９８８年则下降到８３元。这一涨一降，加重了养貂农民的损失。
    反思之三：饲养管理有问题，致使貂皮质量差，卖不出好价钱。１９８８年，我县１．５万个养貂户中，有一半以上为新户。他们缺乏饲养管理技术，从貂种的选择、仔貂的繁殖到入笼育成、貂皮的剥制整理等环节，应用科学技术不够。另外，一窝蜂引入的貂种良莠不齐，近亲繁殖严重，造成貂种退化，貂皮质量下降。
    我认为，我县有关部门只要正视现实，积极寻求对策，我县养貂业走上良性发展的道路是大有希望的。
    眼下，首先要做好宣传工作，稳定养貂农民的情绪。有关部门应及时向农民发布养貂业的动态和市场信息，减少盲目性，使养貂业保持在一个适当的规模。其次，抓好饲料加工业，稳定饲料价格，保证养貂饲料供应。第三，抓好貂皮加工，提高优质貂皮的成品率。有关部门应搞好从选种、繁殖、育成到取皮等环节的技术服务，增强貂皮在国际市场上的竞争力。
    目前，养貂农民手中仍有１０多万张貂皮无销路。有关部门还应积极为养貂户牵线搭桥，使他们手中的貂皮尽快脱手，偿还贷款和债务，甩掉包袱，轻装前进。
    我县城乡现有５个由养貂户自发开辟的貂皮市场，每天有数百人在瑟瑟寒风中等待买主。左图为位于县城一处自由交易市场的一角。
