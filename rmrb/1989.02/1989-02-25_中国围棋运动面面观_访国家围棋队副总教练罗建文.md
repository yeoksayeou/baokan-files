Recently, everyone has been discussing whether Nie Weiping will participate in the fourth China-Japan Go Ladder Match. Why have our young players not performed well in the previous matches?

Luo Jianwen: There are two main reasons. One is technical, and the other is psychological. There is no denying that Nie Weiping has top-notch psychological resilience. However, I believe his victories are mainly due to his technical prowess. Our young players sometimes have the advantage in matches but do not know how to convert it into a win. An advantage does not equate to a winning position, as Nie Weiping has said: "An advantage needs to be turned into a winning position, which requires skill." Of course, young players need time to mature. Nie Weiping was known as the "Nie Hurricane" in the late 1970s, but his performance fluctuated in the early 1980s. Today, he has entered his golden age. This shows that a player's maturation is not a smooth process.

From the perspective of the Go community, we naturally hope that Nie Weiping will participate in the Ladder Match. His chances of winning would be higher. If he does not participate, the impact of the Ladder Match will also be reduced.

Please share your thoughts on the prospects of Go becoming a global sport.

Luo Jianwen: Last year, two major international tournaments were held: the Fujitsu Cup and the Ing Cup. This indicates that Go has taken its first steps towards becoming a global sport. Additionally, the European Go Federation holds the European Championships every year and invites Chinese players to provide guidance. The United States also hosts the U.S. Go Championships. This shows that the influence of Go is expanding globally. Of course, for Go to become a worldwide sport, it will take time and require arduous efforts.

　　中国围棋运动面面观
    ——访国家围棋队副总教练罗建文
    记者：最近大家都在议论第四届中日围棋擂台赛聂卫平出不出场的问题，为什么我们年轻的棋手在前几届擂台赛中表现不甚理想？
    罗建文：这里有两方面原因。一是技术上的，一是心理素质上的。无可否认，聂卫平的心理素质亦是超一流的。但我认为，他取胜主要还是技术上有实力。我们年轻棋手在比赛中有时尽管占有优势，但却不知怎么赢下来。优势并不等于胜势，正像聂卫平所说：“优势要变成胜势，需要功力。”当然，年轻棋手要走向成熟，需要一个过程。聂卫平７０年代末，被称为“聂旋风”，但８０年代初水平又有些波动，而今天则进入黄金时代。由此看一个棋手要成熟起来，不可能一帆风顺。
    从围棋界来讲，我们当然希望擂台赛聂卫平能出场。他出马胜面自然要大一些。他如不参加，擂台赛的影响也会小。
    记者：请您最后谈谈围棋运动走向世界的前景。
    罗建文：去年分别举行了两个世界性大赛，一个是富士通杯，一个是应氏杯。这表明围棋迈出走向世界的第一步。此外，每年欧洲围棋联盟都要举行欧洲锦标赛，并邀请中国棋手去指导，美国也举办全美围棋锦标赛。这说明，围棋运动在世界范围内的影响正在扩大。当然，围棋要变成世界性的一项运动，还需要假以时日，也需要付出艰苦的努力。
