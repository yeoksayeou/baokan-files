	Developing a Countermeasure for a Difficult Infectious Disease: Hepatitis D Test Kit Successfully Developed

	Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 1 (Reporter Zhu Yu) The Beijing Second Infectious Disease Hospital has recently developed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit for Hepatitis D virus antigen and antibody, which is now being used in clinical, epidemiological, and basic research.

	Hepatitis D is one of the more severe types of hepatitis. Its virus is closely related to the Hepatitis B virus. There are two forms of infection in humans: co-infection with Hepatitis B virus and superinfection on the basis of Hepatitis B virus infection. Co-infection often manifests as acute onset, with patients recovering relatively quickly; superinfection often turns chronic, with severe symptoms and a higher mortality rate.

	The Hepatitis D test kit developed by the Beijing Second Infectious Disease Hospital has good sensitivity and specificity compared to international standard kits, but is more affordable. Currently, the hospital has begun mass production of Hepatitis D detection test kits and has initiated a nationwide epidemiological survey of Hepatitis D.

　　对付一种难对付的传染病
    丁型肝炎试剂盒研制成功
    新华社北京２月１日电  （记者朱玉）北京第二传染病医院最近研制出丁型肝炎病毒抗原和抗体的酶联免疫试剂盒，已用于临床、流行病学和基础研究。
    丁型肝炎是各类肝炎中较为严重的一种，其病毒与乙型肝炎病毒关系密切，它对人体的感染形式，有与乙型肝炎病毒联合感染和在乙型肝炎病毒感染基础上的重叠感染两种。联合感染多表现为急性发病，病人恢复较快；重叠感染多转为慢性，且症状严重，病死率较高。
    北京第二传染病医院研制的丁型肝炎试剂盒与国外标准药盒相比，敏感性和特异性均较好，价格却较为低廉。目前，这家医院已开始大量生产丁型肝炎检测试剂盒，并已开展对全国丁型肝炎的流行病学调查。
