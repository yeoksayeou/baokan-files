They are among the sailors
— A Record of Submarine Unit Commander Yu Baozhi and Political Commissar Li Junlun

The narrow submarine cabin, the murky air, the sailors sweating profusely… He lifted his head from the periscope. “Battle readiness, torpedo attack!” The crisp and decisive command echoed in the depths of the South China Sea.

He is Commander Yu Baozhi of the People's Navy's submarine unit stationed at the forefront of the South China Sea. This major general, who enlisted in 1960, graduated from the Naval Submarine Academy, and later underwent composite command training with outstanding results, has, over the course of 30 years, traversed the mountains and waters of the country's 10,000-li coastline from the North Sea and East Sea to the South Sea. During his tenure as a submarine captain, he commanded China's self-designed and manufactured new-generation submarine, setting a record of continuous long-distance sailing for 52 days and nights. This provided the People's Navy submarine unit with a wealth of valuable data for long-range combat and training. In March of last year, during the struggle to defend the sovereignty of the Nansha Islands, Yu Baozhi personally led the unit to sail to the war zone. In the high-wind and high-wave conditions of the Nansha Sea, with limited hydrological data, he led the officers and soldiers to overcome numerous difficulties and engage with enemy ships in the turbulent ocean, successfully completing the mission. He was highly praised by General Der Hongtian, who was inspecting the work in the South China Sea at the time. Someone once calculated that according to the submarine training syllabus, young and strong sailors go to sea only 50 days a year, while this veteran sailor in his fifties exceeds this number.

Now, Yu Baozhi is about to command the submarine to go to sea again. The unit's political commissar, Li Junlun, specially came to the submarine to help him check and understand the sailors' thoughts. The two support and cooperate with each other seamlessly. Two years ago, Li Junlun was transferred from the scenic Dalian to the South China Sea. Due to the hot climate of Hainan Island, he found it difficult to adapt, and for several weeks, he could not eat or sleep well.

At that time, influenced by the societal trend of "money first" and "practical benefits," the unit spread a saying: "If you want to become prosperous, hurry up and take off your military uniform." Some cadres, in order to retire early, wrote reports or directly pleaded with leaders. Li Junlun understood that the unit was responsible for guarding the southern gate of the motherland. To ensure the completion of combat readiness and training tasks, he was willing to play a supporting role and assist the military commander in doing a good job. At the first military meeting after taking office, Li Junlun delivered an impassioned speech: "The Party and the people have entrusted us to guard the forefront of the South China Sea. The responsibility is heavy. If we fail to live up to expectations, we will be ashamed of the motherland and the people. From today on, the Party committee will set an example, and all levels of cadres will take the lead in executing." The next day, he rode a bicycle to the grassroots level. From then on, the dock, the barracks, and the engine room often saw Li Junlun talking heart-to-heart with the cadres and soldiers. Based on understanding the unit's thoughts, he organized the unit to carry out the "Love the South China Sea and Dedicate to the South China Sea" activity. Two years passed in the blink of an eye. His wife, who had been separated in Dalian, wrote to him: "You have been gone for more than two years, rarely writing letters, and not coming back to visit. It seems you have forgotten this family." On the scale of family and unit, Li Junlun unhesitatingly placed the weight on the latter.

There is harvest where there is sowing. Under the joint efforts of Yu Baozhi and Li Junlun, the unit's training enthusiasm reached an unprecedented height, political work was solid and active, and it was repeatedly rated as an advanced unit for education and training by higher authorities.

　　他们在水兵中间   
    ——记某潜艇部队长于宝志、政委李俊琏
    彭保务
    狭窄的潜艇机舱，浑浊的气浪，汗流浃背的水兵……
    他从潜望镜前抬起头。“战斗准备，鱼雷攻击！”干脆果断的口令声回荡在南中国海深处。
    他就是人民海军驻南海前哨某潜艇部队长于宝志。这位１９６０年入伍，毕业于海军潜艇学院，后又经合成指挥专业训练并取得优异成绩的大校军官，３０年来，从北海、东海，转战南海，踏遍了祖国万里海疆的山山水水。他任艇长期间，曾指挥我国自行设计制造的新一代潜艇，创造了连续远航５２昼夜的纪录，为人民海军潜艇部队的远洋作战和训练，提供了大量珍贵依据资料。去年３月，在保卫南沙主权斗争中，于宝志又亲自率部驾驶潜艇开赴战区，在风大浪高、水文资料缺少的南沙海域，带领干部战士克服重重困难，与敌舰周旋在波涛汹涌的大洋上，出色地完成了任务，受到当时来南海视察工作的总参谋长迟浩田上将的高度评价。有人给于宝志做过统计，按潜艇训练大纲规定，年轻力壮的水兵战士每年出海只有５０天，而他这位年过半百的老水兵却跃居在这个数字之上。
    现在，于宝志又要指挥潜艇出海了，部队政委李俊琏专门来到潜艇上帮他检查了解艇员的思想情况。他俩相互支持配合默契。前年，李俊琏从风景秀丽的大连调来南海，因不适应海南岛炎热的气候，他一连几个星期食不甘味，彻夜难眠。
    当时，受社会上“向钱看”、“求实惠”思潮影响，部队流行一种“要想奔小康，赶快脱军装”的说法。有的干部为了早日转业，打报告或直接找领导硬磨软缠。李俊琏心里清楚，部队担负着守卫祖国南大门的使命，为保证战备训练任务的完成，自己要甘当配角、协助军事主官做好工作。在上任后第一次召开的军人大会上，李俊琏激昂发言：“党和人民让我们守卫在祖国南海前哨，责任重大，若失厚望，愧对祖国，愧对人民，从今天起党委首先做表率，各级干部带头执行。”第二天，他蹬上自行车“沉”到了基层，从那以后，码头上，营房里，机舱内经常可以看到李俊琏同干部战士谈心的情景。在摸清部队思想情况的基础上，他组织部队开展了“热爱南海献身南海”的活动。一晃两年过去了，远在大连分居的老伴来信嗔怪他：“你一走两年多，既很少写信，也不回来看看，大概把这个家忘了。”在家庭与部队的天平上，李俊琏毫不犹豫把砝码放在后者。
    有耕耘必有收获。在于宝志和李俊琏的努力配合下，这个部队训练热情空前高涨，政治工作扎实活跃，多次被上级评为教育训练先进单位。
