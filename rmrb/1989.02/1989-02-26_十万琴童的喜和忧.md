According to incomplete statistics, there are currently 100,000 children and teenagers in Shanghai learning to play the piano, violin, electronic keyboard, and accordion. In just one year, various organizations, art schools, and other units held 15 city-wide competitions for piano, violin, electronic keyboard, and accordion, with over 8,000 participants. Nearly 200 individuals won various forms of awards. Senior musicians have praised, "In the coming years, among these diligent young musicians, there will surely emerge a Mozart, a Paganini, a Chopin."

However, amidst the joy, insightful individuals cannot help but express deep concerns about some trends in children learning musical instruments. It is understood that the city has 140,000 high-end home electronic keyboards and 40,000 pianos. Parents almost universally have a beautiful wish for their children, setting strict practice regulations. Countless children have to get up before dawn to practice, rush through lunch after school to sit at the piano, and in the evenings, it is an unbreakable golden time for practice. Many parents see musical instruments as a tool for creating prodigies.

In the midst of the "learning music craze," there is a trend of children starting to learn musical instruments at increasingly younger ages. A few years ago, if a 7-year-old child could play "I Love Beijing, Tiananmen" or perform "Morning in the Miao Mountains," many people would be amazed; but now, a 5-year-old child playing Bach's high-difficulty "D Minor Prelude and Fugue" is no longer news. Many parents do not understand the laws of child development and child psychology, blindly pushing ahead with teaching, not only affecting the child's basic musical skills but also planting seeds of dislike, resistance, and hatred towards playing the piano.

　　十万琴童的喜和忧
    据不完全统计，目前上海有１０万少年儿童在学习钢琴、小提琴、电子琴、手风琴。仅去年一年，各团体、艺校和其他单位举办过的全市规模的钢琴、小提琴、电子琴、手风琴比赛就达１５次，参赛者８０００余人次，各种形式的获奖者近２００人次。老音乐家赞许说：“今后若干年，在这批孜孜不倦的琴童中，一定会出现莫扎特，出现帕格尼尼，出现肖邦。”
    然而欣喜之余，有识之士又不免对少儿学琴的一些倾向表示深深的担忧。据了解，全市私人拥有高中档家庭电子琴有１４万台，钢琴４万台。父母对子女几乎都有一个美好的愿望，制订了严格的习琴规定。多少个孩子，东方未晓就得起床学琴，中午放学，匆忙扒完饭，又得坐在琴凳上，而晚上更是雷打不动的习琴黄金时间。许多家长眼里，乐器成了神童制造器。
    在“学琴热”中，出现了儿童习琴年龄越来越小的趋势。前些年，若有一个７岁儿童弹一曲《我爱北京天安门》，或拉一段《苗岭的早晨》，不少人会啧啧称奇；而现在，一个５岁儿童弹奏一首巴赫高难度的《ｄ小调序曲与赋格》都不成为新闻了。许多家长不了解幼儿身心发展的规律和儿童心理，一味超前教学，不仅影响儿童的学琴基本功，而且潜伏了儿童对弹琴厌恶、抗拒、憎恨的学习心理。
