A large-scale nuclear physics experimental device has been successfully developed in Lanzhou. The online isotope separator has high resolution.

The first online isotope separator in China was recently successfully tested offline at the Institute of Modern Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences in Lanzhou. It achieved high-resolution mass spectra for argon and xenon, reaching the advanced international level in terms of resolution capability.

The online isotope separator is a large-scale nuclear physics experimental device used for synthesizing new nuclides and conducting research on short-lived nuclides. It has wide-ranging applications in atomic physics, solid-state physics, astrophysics, and biology.

Online separation is a new technology that has developed over the past 20 years. Its basic idea is to link the processes of producing short-lived nuclides, mass separation, and measuring their decay properties in time, so as to identify and study these nuclides. This research will deepen human understanding of the structure and motion laws of the microscopic world.

Scientists refer to various types of atomic nuclei as nuclides. Most nuclides are very unstable and have extremely short lifetimes, making it impossible to study them using conventional methods before they decay. The use of online separation technology makes such research and understanding possible.

The online isotope separator developed by the Institute of Modern Physics will be connected with China's largest Heavy Ion Research Facility in Lanzhou to conduct nuclear physics experiments.

　　一大型核物理实验设备在兰州研制成功    
    在线同位素分离器分辨率高
    新华社兰州２月１３日电  （通讯员宋文杰）我国第一台在线同位素分离器日前在兰州中国科学院近代物理研究所离线调试成功，得到氩和氙的高分辨率质谱，分辨本领达到同类设备的国际先进水平。
    在线同位素分离器是合成新核素、开展短寿命核素研究的大型核物理实验设备。它在原子物理、固体物理、天体物理和生物学研究中具有广泛的应用价值。
    在线分离是近２０年发展起来的一种新技术。它的基本思路是，将短寿命核素的产生、质量分离及其衰变性质的测量过程在时间上衔接起来，以便对该核素进行鉴别和研究。这种研究将深化人类对微观世界的结构和运动规律的认识。
    科学家把各种不同类型的原子核称为核素。绝大多数核素很不稳定，寿命极短，用通常的方法来不及研究，它们就“死光”了。采用在线分离技术就使这种研究和认识得以实现。
    近代物理所研制的在线同位素分离器将与我国最大的兰州重离子加速器联机，进行核物理实验研究。
