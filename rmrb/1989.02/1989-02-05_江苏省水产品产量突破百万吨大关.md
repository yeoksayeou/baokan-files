Jiangsu Province's aquatic product output has exceeded 100 million tons for the first time. This year, Jiangsu Province's total aquatic product output has exceeded 100 million tons, achieving the target set in the "Seventh Five-Year Plan" two years ahead of schedule.

Jiangsu is one of China's key fishery provinces. From 1984 to 1987, the province's fishery industry saw an average annual increase of more than 10 million tons. Last year, Jiangsu's fishery departments focused on developing fishery as a key part of the "vegetable basket project" for both urban and rural areas. Various levels of government invested a total of 10 million yuan, and the Agricultural Bank of China provided nearly 300 million yuan in loans to update and renovate fish and shrimp ponds. The province's freshwater fish farming area reached 1.27 million mu, accounting for more than half of the total farming area. Building on the significant increases of previous years, the province's total aquatic product output in 1988 reached 102.7 million tons, an 11% increase over the previous year.

    ▲江苏省水产品产量突破百万吨大关　去年，江苏省水产品总产量首次突破一百万吨，提前两年实现“七五”规划提出的目标。
    江苏是我国重点渔业省份之一。一九八四年到一九八七年的四年中，全省渔业平均年增产量都在十万吨以上。去年，江苏省水产部门把发展渔业作为城乡“菜篮子工程”的重点来抓。各级政府先后投入资金一千万元，农行贷款近三亿元，用于更新和改造鱼虾池。全省淡水鱼精养面积达一百二十七万亩，占养殖总面积的一半以上。在前几年大幅度增产的基础上，一九八八年全省水产品总产量达一百○二点七万吨，又比上年增长百分之十一。　　　（据新华社）
