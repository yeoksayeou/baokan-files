	The CPC Central Committee Secretary Hanus emphasized on the 7th that a more resolute struggle must be waged against the currently existing anti-socialist forces.

	He made these remarks at a meeting of national state-owned enterprise party officials held here. The Red Rights Journal today published this speech.

	Hanus pointed out that the recent march on Wenceslas Square in Prague shows that the activities of organizations and groups such as Charter 77 have intensified, and they are attempting to become a legitimate political opposition.

	He stated that the activities of these forces have "exceeded the scope of socialist pluralism." He called for resolute opposition to the various schemes of anti-socialist groups attempting to influence social life and determine the direction of social development.

	The North Bohemian State People's Committee building was blown up in the early hours of the 8th, causing severe material damage but no casualties. The cause of the explosion is still unknown.

	The Red Rights Journal today said that this explosion is a terrorist act by the enemy aimed at creating chaos and disrupting the current reforms. The report also said that before this explosion, some units in North Bohemia frequently received threatening anonymous calls and letters, threatening to place bombs in factories, shops, and schools.

　  要同反社会主义势力进行坚决斗争   
    北捷克州人委大楼被炸　党报认为是敌人恐怖活动
    新华社布拉格２月９日电  捷共中央书记哈努斯７日发表讲话强调，要同目前存在的“反社会主义势力进行更加坚决的斗争”。
    他是在这里举行的全国国营企业党的负责人会议上说这番话的。《红色权利报》今天刊登了这一讲话。
    哈努斯指出，不久前在布拉格瓦茨拉夫广场上发生的游行事件表明，“七七宪章”等组织和集团的活动显著加强，他们试图成为某种合法的政治反对派。
    他表示，这些势力的活动“已超出了社会主义多元化的范围”。要坚决反对反社会主义集团企图影响社会生活、确定社会发展方向的各种图谋。
    新华社布拉格２月９日电　北捷克州州人民委员会大楼２月８日凌晨被炸，物资损失严重，但无人员伤亡。目前，爆炸原因尚未查明。
    《红色权利报》今天说，这次爆炸是敌人进行的恐怖活动，目的是制造混乱，破坏当前的改革。报道还说，在发生这次爆炸之前，北捷克州一些单位经常收到威胁性匿名电话和匿名信，扬言要在工厂商店和学校等处放置炸弹。
