The European Commission presented a report to the Council on February 22 titled "Prospects and Issues of Economic Policy for 1989 and 1990." While acknowledging the positive developments, the Commission reiterated that the purpose of the European Community's economic policy is "to ensure the success of 1992 and maintain the environment."

The report predicts that after achieving a 3.7% economic growth rate in 1988, the European Community can expect to maintain a 3% growth rate for this year and next. During this period, it is estimated that 2.5 million jobs will be created, and the unemployment rate will gradually decrease from 11.2% in 1988 to an estimated 10.75% this year, 10.5% next year, and below 10% by 1992.

The Commission believes that the main factors contributing to the positive economic trend in the European Community are:

1. The economic sector is actively preparing and adjusting its development strategies to achieve a unified market.
2. Investment has shown significant growth.
3. Wage increases are well-controlled.
4. Global trade is thriving.

However, the report acknowledges that there are potential risks to economic development both internationally and within the European Community. Severe imbalances in international trade, Japan's large surplus, and the United States' significant trade deficit and budget deficit could lead to rising interest rates and strengthened trade protectionism. The debt problem in the Third World has not been effectively resolved. Within the 12 member countries of the European Community, there are three main issues:

1. Trade payment imbalances. Countries like West Germany, the Netherlands, and Belgium have surpluses, while France, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom have deficits. The trade balance gaps between these two groups of countries are widening.
2. Countries such as Italy, Greece, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Belgium have not seen a reduction in their fiscal deficits despite continuous economic growth in recent years.
3. Inflation is once again affecting the economies of some countries, causing serious concern among Western European experts.

### 欧共体委员会提出经济政策报告  有积极因素　也有潜在危险

　　欧共体委员会提出经济政策报告
    有积极因素　也有潜在危险
    本报布鲁塞尔２月２３日电  记者魏崴报道：２２日，欧洲共同体委员会通过一份呈交理事会的报告：“１９８９年和１９９０年经济政策的前景与问题”。在肯定形势发展良好的同时，委员会重申欧共体经济政策的目的，是“为争取１９９２年的成功，确保环境”。
    报告预计，欧共体经济增长率于１９８８年实现３．７％之后，今年和明年可望保持在３％；在同期内，可创造２５０万个就业机会，其失业率将会由去年的１１．２％逐步下降，今年估计为１０．７５％，明年为１０．５％，到１９９２年时可低于１０％。
    委员会认为，促成欧共体经济发展势头较好的因素，主要有：１、为实现统一大市场，经济界在积极准备，调整其发展战略；２、投资有明显的增强；３、工资的增加受到较好的控制；４、世界贸易呈现蓬勃生机。
    但是，报告承认，无论在国际上还是在欧共体内部，均潜伏着遏制经济发展的危险。国际贸易严重失衡，日本顺差过大，美国的逆差及预算赤字惊人，可能导致利率抬升和贸易保护主义加强。第三世界债务问题未得切实改善，在欧共体１２个成员国之间，亦存在３个困难：１、贸易支付不平衡。西德、荷兰、比利时等国出超，法国、意大利、西班牙和英国等逆差。这两类国家在贸易收支上的差额有增大之势。２、意大利、希腊、荷兰、葡萄牙和比利时等国家财政赤字近几年并未因经济持续增长而有所减少。３、通货膨胀再度困扰一些国家经济，引起西欧专家们严重不安。
