Experts predict that in the next few decades, China's climate may warm due to the global "greenhouse effect." The northern boundary of the subtropical zone may extend to the Yellow River, making winter temperatures in Xuzhou and Zhengzhou similar to those in Hangzhou and Wuhan today. The northwestern region will become more arid, and coastal areas will face issues with seawater intrusion.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 3 (Reporter Zhao Peng) Chinese meteorologists predict that under the influence of the global "greenhouse effect," China's climate may warm over the next few decades, with the northern boundary of the subtropical zone potentially expanding to the Yellow River. Winter temperatures in Xuzhou and Zhengzhou may become similar to those in Hangzhou and Wuhan today.

Recently, renowned climatologist Professor Zhang Jijia shared with reporters the initial research results on contemporary climate change by China's climate research community. Using advanced computers and numerical simulation methods, they modeled the changes in various factors affecting climate to analyze trends in climate change. They also utilized China's extensive meteorological database to study trends in climate change from annual meteorological observations. The initial results indicate that due to the increase in greenhouse gases, the global climate will warm. China's future climate change trends may align with those in the Northern Hemisphere, meaning that over the next few decades, China's surface temperatures may warm in a fluctuating manner, with the warming amplitude not falling below that of the Northern Hemisphere. Southern regions will see smaller temperature increases, while northern regions will see larger increases.

The study suggests that this warming trend will have profound impacts on China's climate. The northern boundary of China's subtropical zone may shift from the current Qinling Mountains and Huai River to the Yellow River, making winter temperatures in Xuzhou and Zhengzhou similar to those in Hangzhou and Wuhan today. Permafrost in Northeast China and the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, as well as small glaciers in the Qilian Mountains and Tian Shan, may disappear. In the tropics, Hainan Island will see increased summer rainfall, while most of China, especially the northwestern arid regions, will experience decreased summer rainfall, exacerbating drought conditions.

Rising temperatures will lead to sea-level rise, affecting coastal areas from Liaoning to Hainan Island. In addition to direct land inundation by seawater, the extent of salinized land will expand. Changes in erosion and sedimentation conditions along the coast and in the lower reaches of major rivers will impact navigation and increase drainage difficulties in flood-prone areas, as well as increase the engineering workload for sea dikes and ports.

Zhang Jijia stated that this prediction is not a personal opinion but reflects a consensus among the domestic meteorological scientific community. This research has been included in China's first "Climate Blue Book."

　　专家预言我国气候在未来几十年内可能变暖
　　副热带北界将移到黄河以北
　　郑州冬天似杭州　西北地区更干旱　海水内浸成问题
    据新华社北京２月３日电  （记者赵鹏）我国气象学家预言：在全球“温室效应”作用下，未来几十年内，我国气候有可能在波动过程中趋于变暖，副热带的北界有可能扩展到黄河以北，冬季徐州、郑州一带的气温将与现在的杭州、武汉相似。
    我国著名气候学家章基嘉教授最近向记者介绍了我国气候界对当代气候变化的初步研究结果。他们在研究中，应用了先进的计算机和数值模拟方法，模拟影响气候诸因素的变化，从中分析出气候变化的趋势，同时，利用我国丰富的气象资料库，从历年气象实际观测资料中研究气候变化的趋势，研究的初步结果是：由于温室气体的增加，全球气候将趋于变暖。我国未来气候的变化趋势与北半球气候变化的趋势可能是一致的，即今后几十年我国地面气温将可能在不断波动的情况下趋于变暖，变暖的幅度将不会低于北半球的变暖幅度，而且南方增温较小，北方增温较大。
    研究认为，这种变暖的趋势对我国气候的影响将是深远的。我国副热带的北界将由现在的秦岭、淮河一带扩展到黄河以北，冬季徐州、郑州一带的温度将会和现在的杭州、武汉相似，而东北和青藏高原的多年冻土的大部分和祁连山、天山的小冰川都将趋于消失。地处热带的海南岛夏季降水将增加，而地处中纬度的我国大部分地区夏季雨量将减少，尤其我国西北地区原来就是干旱区，下个世纪旱象将更加明显。
    气温升高将导致海平面上升，在我国，海平面的上升将会影响从辽宁至海南岛的所有滨海地带，除海水内浸直接淹没部分土地外，盐渍化土地的范围也将扩大，沿海和大河下游的侵蚀与堆积条件改变，影响航道交通，加重涝区排水的困难，也将会增加海堤和海港的工程量。
    章基嘉说，这一推测不是他个人的一家之言，国内气象科学界初步探讨的结果基本上趋于一致。这一研究成果，已载入我国第一部《气候蓝皮书》中。
