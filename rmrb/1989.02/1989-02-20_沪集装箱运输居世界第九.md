Shanghai Far East Shipping Company's container ship fleet has reached the ninth position in the world in terms of scale and container transport capacity, making it the only Chinese fleet to enter the ranks of the world's top ten container shipping companies.

The company currently owns 46 container ships of various types and has opened more than 20 international container liner routes to the Americas, Europe, Australia, and Southeast Asia, as well as to Hong Kong. It has initially formed a container transport network along the Pacific Rim. Recently, Shanghai Far East Shipping Company implemented a measure to change the one-way circular transport of China's first China-Japan-Australia-New Zealand container liner route to a cross-circular transport system. This addition of three 10,000-ton container ships, each with a capacity of 743 containers, will increase the transport capacity by 116%.
