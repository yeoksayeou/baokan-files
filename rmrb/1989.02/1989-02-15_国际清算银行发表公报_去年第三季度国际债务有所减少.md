The Bank for International Settlements today issued a report stating that by the third quarter of 1988, the total amount of loans from developing countries and non-member developed countries to its member countries (i.e., major industrialized countries) was $697.4 billion, a decrease of $1.6 billion from the second quarter. During the same period, the deposits of borrowing countries in the banks of member countries of the Bank for International Settlements increased by $10.5 billion, totaling $50.2 billion.

The Bank for International Settlements was established in May 1935 and is headquartered in Basel, Switzerland. It is one of the important international financial institutions and the center for coordinating monetary and financial policies among major Western countries.

The report states that the total debt of the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries to the banks of member countries of the Bank for International Settlements in the first half of 1988 was $4.3 billion, with no increase in the third quarter of that year. Among them, the debts of the Soviet Union and Hungary slightly decreased.

The total debt of non-OPEC developing countries to the member countries of the Bank for International Settlements decreased by $1 billion in the first half of last year, and further decreased by $1.3 billion in the third quarter, amounting to $36.6 billion. During this period, the deposits of these countries in the banks of member countries of the Bank for International Settlements slightly increased.

In the third quarter of last year, the debt of Latin American countries to the banks of member countries of the Bank for International Settlements was $21.56 billion, a decrease of $1.8 billion from the first half of the year. The report states that since June 1987, the total debt of Latin American countries has decreased by more than $1.3 billion.

Experts from the Bank for International Settlements believe that the reduction in the total amount of international debt in the third quarter of last year was mainly achieved through debt restructuring, asset sales, bond buybacks, and debt forgiveness, in addition to repayment.

The report states that during this period, the loans of OPEC member countries from the member countries of the Bank for International Settlements were $2.9 billion (their total loans were $12.57 billion). The main borrowers were Middle Eastern countries, with Iraq alone borrowing $800 million. At the same time, these countries are the main depositors in the banks of member countries of the Bank for International Settlements, with their deposits increasing by $6 billion in the third quarter of last year.

　　国际清算银行发表公报    
    去年第三季度国际债务有所减少
    新华社日内瓦２月１３日电  （记者向奎观）国际清算银行今天发表的公报说，到１９８８年第三季度为止，发展中国家和没有加入该行的发达国家向其成员国（即主要工业化国家）的借款总额为６９７４亿美元，比第二季度减少１６亿美元；借款国在国际清算银行成员国银行的存款在这期间则增加了１０５亿美元，总额达到５０２０亿美元。
    国际清算银行创立于１９３５年５月，设在瑞士的巴塞尔，是重要的国际金融机构之一，也是西方主要国家协商货币金融政策的中心。
    公报说，苏联和东欧国家１９８８年上半年欠国际清算银行成员国银行的债款总额为４３亿美元，去年第三季度没有增加。其中，苏联和匈牙利的债款略有减少。
    发展中国家中非石油输出国组织成员国欠国际清算银行成员国的债款总额，在去年上半年减少１００亿美元的基础上，去年第三季度又减少１３亿美元，即尚欠３６６０亿美元，在这期间，这些国家在国际清算银行成员国银行的存款略有增加。
    去年第三季度，拉美国家欠国际清算银行成员国银行的债款为２１５６亿美元，比去年上半年减少１８亿美元。报告说，１９８７年６月以来，拉美国家的债款总额共减少１３０多亿美元。
    国际清算银行专家认为，去年第三季度国际债务总额有所减少，除还债外，主要是通过债务折换、资产出售、债券赎买以及债务减免实现的。
    公报说，欧佩克成员国在这期间从国际清算银行成员国的借款为２９亿美元（它们的借款总额为１２５７亿美元）。借款的主要是中东国家，仅伊拉克就借贷８亿美元。同时，这些国家又是国际清算银行成员国银行的主要存户，它们的存款在去年第三季度增加了６０亿美元。
