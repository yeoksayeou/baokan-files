Title: The Debate in Xiyang Village

On the morning of January 19, 1989, we entered the courtyard of the Xiyang Village Committee in Yuncheng City. A strange yet familiar world greeted us.

Four black-gray loudspeakers on the roof squeaked under the electrician's tinkering. Men squatted on the ground, sat on bricks, or even took off one shoe to cushion their bottoms. Women either cradled their children or breastfed them without a care in the cold wind, chatting and laughing merrily. This scene quickly transported you back to a time that seemed both distant and recent. The only difference was that their hands were no longer mending shoes but knitting pink and green sweaters and pants. The children, still as muddy as ever, climbed and jumped on a tractor, their hands holding corncandy, bananas, and oranges instead of the hard, dry buns of the past. The girls' hairstyles had also changed from short hair to permed styles, though not very fashionable.

All this was like a slow-flowing river, with ten years of history flowing past, leaving what kind of mark on these farmers?

The meeting began, with 11 farmers taking the stage to "debate." Some advocated for "intensive management and the elimination of extensive management," others spoke about "transitioning from fragmented to integrated land use," and still others suggested "maximizing water and electricity benefits and preventing the theft of irrigation equipment."

There was a woman named Bian Putao, formerly a village teacher. Her topic was "To get rich, plant cotton." She did the math: one mu of cotton yields 100 kilograms, one kilogram of lint cotton sells for 4 yuan, so one mu brings in 400 yuan. One kilogram of lint cotton produces 1.7 kilograms of cotton seeds, so one mu yields 170 kilograms, selling at 0.8 yuan per kilogram, bringing in 136 yuan. One mu of cotton thus nets 450 yuan. Starting in 1989, the state increased the price of lint cotton by 0.5 yuan per kilogram, adding another 50 yuan per mu. A couple can manage ten mu of cotton. She cited examples of Wang Mianmian from the first team and Wang Hongbing from the second team, who both got rich from cotton. She then mentioned her own family, where her children's education, supporting the elderly, building a new house, and marrying off a daughter-in-law—all 120,000 yuan—came from cotton. Her detailed accounting and comprehensive grasp of the situation left us amazed. The precision of the speakers' calculations was the most striking feature.

There was also a farmer named Zhao Zhongyi. As soon as he stepped onto the stage, people laughed. He was an outsider who had moved to Xiyang and had never attended school. He said, "This is the first time I've spoken in Xiyang Brigade." He told his fellow villagers that doing business was too risky. He had lost money running a brick kiln but made a fortune planting cotton. He vowed to stop playing mahjong and to seriously study science and engage in agricultural production. "Playing mahjong, you lose two packs of cigarettes in one night."

As soon as Wang Dingmao stepped onto the stage, he shouted, "I am very happy to attend this seminar and extend my warm congratulations." He said, "No matter how you say it, the leadership team is key." He suggested that leaders should fulfill their duties; that experts and professors should be invited to give lectures and establish agricultural technology information service personnel; that leaders should not just focus on their own responsibility plots and get rich themselves. He also suggested that capable people should be invited to participate in the village committee's production research. His loud voice made the loudspeaker squeak.

That day, the meeting hall was full of people. We interviewed a farmer:

"Do you fear the village secretary or the village head?"

"Who fears them? If I were to go up there, my suggestions would be even harsher."

"Would you be punished if you didn't come to the meeting today?"

"Work points aren't recorded, and they can't deduct your rations. What punishment? We just wanted to come and listen. This village has many people who study science! Last year, the region held a science and technology competition, and the awards were almost all won by our village. Later, they didn't believe it and came to test us on the spot. We convinced them. There are outsiders coming to give lectures, and the courtyard is full at night."

"Why?"

"Because of the benefits of science and technology."

"What would you do if you didn't attend the meeting today?"

"Make fried dough sticks. This village has cotton that can be pressed into oil. There's wheat, and every family fries thirty or forty kilograms."

Yuncheng City Party Secretary Li Pengfei said that nowadays, farmers will only follow you if you serve them. Their minds are their own. In Xiyang, there is a "Low- and Medium-Yield Field Improvement Association" that is as influential as the village committee. Here, many minds have become one.

That day, the golden rays of the sun made the banner "Xiyang Village 1989 Agricultural Production to New Heights Debate" particularly eye-catching. Under this new banner, you felt a familiar meeting hall, familiar people, and unexpected language and thoughts. About commerce, about building houses, about "democracy"; and about wearing new clothes while still having blackened faces, these topics could also spark debates in Xiyang?

As we shook hands with the enthusiastic people of Xiyang to say goodbye, we noticed two pairs of hands: a girl's hand—wearing a ring, an old man's hand—wearing a needle cap, both shining gold. We believe the girl had just put on the ring, while the old man's needle cap had likely never been removed.

### 西阳村的论证

　　西阳村的论证
　　阎晓明　高勤荣
    １９８９年１月１９日上午，我们走进运城市西阳村村委会大院，一个陌生而又熟悉的世界扑面而来。
    房顶上四个黑灰色的喇叭在电工摆弄下吱吱叫唤。男人们有的蹲在地上，有的坐在砖头上，有的干脆脱下一只鞋垫在屁股下；女人们或抱着孩子，或毫无顾忌地在寒风中奶着孩子，又说又笑好不热闹。这种场面，很快让你感到了那个过去了很久、很久，又仿佛是昨天的时代。只是，他们手中的活计，由鞋底、鞋帮变成了粉红、绿色的毛衣、毛裤。孩子们一如往昔的泥猴一般，在一辆拖拉机上爬上窜下，手上的什物由原来硬梆梆的窝头变成了玉米糖、香蕉和桔子。姑娘们的发式也由原来的剪发变成了烫得不太时髦的卷发……
    这一切，如同一条缓缓流动的河，１０年历史流淌过去，在这些农民身上打下了什么样的烙印？
    会议开始了，一共有１１位农民上台“论证”。有的提倡“集约经营，取缔粗放经营”，有的讲“土地要由分散向整体发展”，还有的建议“向水电要效益，防止偷盗灌溉设备”。
    有位女人叫卞葡萄，以前是个民办教师。她讲的题目是“要发家，种棉花”。她算了一笔帐：一亩产棉花１００公斤，一公斤皮棉４元，一亩就是４００元，一公斤皮棉产１．７公斤棉花籽‘一亩１７０公斤，一公斤８角计算，一亩收１３６元。一亩棉花纯收入４５０元。１９８９年始，国家每公斤皮棉加价０．５元，一亩又多收入５０元。夫妻可管十几亩棉花。她又举了一队王绵绵、二队王红兵都是靠种棉花发了财的事例。然后说她自己孩子上学、奉养老人、盖新房、娶媳妇，１．２万元都是靠棉花来的。她算帐的精细，掌握情况的全面，都叫我们惊讶。发言者算帐之精细是最显著的特点。
    还有一位叫赵忠义的农民，一往台上走，人们就笑开了，他是外地迁来的，没上过一天学，他说：“我来西阳大队叫唤，这是头一次。”他告诉乡亲们，经商风险太大。他包砖窑赔了钱，种棉花发了大财。他表示：以后不打麻将了，实实在在学科学，搞农业生产。“打麻将，一黑夜还要赔两盒烟哩。”
    王丁卯一走上台，就扯着嗓子喊开了，“今天开研讨会，我非常高兴，表示热烈祝贺。”他说：“说一千，道一万，领导班子是关键。”建议领导干部要在其位，谋其政；建议请专家、教授讲课，建立农技信息服务员；建议领导干部不要自己有了责任田，只顾自己发财致富。他还建议在村委会研究生产时，吸收有能力的人参加。他嗓门之大，震得扩音器吱吱作响。
    那天会场里的人很多，我们采访了一位农民：
    “怕不怕你们书记、村长？”
    “谁怕他？让我上去，我提的意见更狠。”
    “今天不来开会是不是要处分你们？”
    “又不记工分，他也扣不了口粮，拿甚处分？咱就是想来听听。这村人们学科技多着呢！去年地区报搞科技竞赛，那奖都快让我村包了。后来不相信还来考过，当场考。服了。有外头人来讲课，黑夜院里也满满的。”
    “为什么？”
    “沾了科技的光了。”
    “今天不开会干什么？”
    “炸麻花。这村有棉花能榨油。有麦子，家家都炸三、四十公斤。”
    运城市委书记李鹏飞说，如今的农民，只有服务于他，他才服从你。他们的脑袋都长到自己脖子上了。在西阳，就有一个与村委会齐名的“中低产田改造协会”，在这里，许多脑袋汇成了一个脑袋。
    那天，太阳的金辉把“西阳村１９８９年农业再上新台阶论证会”的横标映照得格外夺目。在这面新的旗帜下，你感觉到似曾相识的会场，似曾相识的人们，以及那出乎预见的语言和思想。关于经商，关于盖房，关于“民主”；还有穿着新衣服、依旧满脸污黑的孩子等等，这些什么时候在西阳也能引起论证呢？
    我们伸手向热情的西阳人道别时，注意到这样两双手：姑娘的手——戴着戒指，老人的手——戴着顶针，都是金黄闪闪的。姑娘手上的戒指，我们相信刚戴上不久，而老人手上的顶针，怕一辈子也没有摘下过。
