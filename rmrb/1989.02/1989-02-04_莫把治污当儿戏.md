Currently, local industries in our county are thriving, with township enterprises achieving an annual total output value exceeding 300 million yuan. However, environmental pollution has also worsened. According to relevant departments, the 28 square kilometers of airspace above the county seat has an annual emission of 175 tons of soot from domestic coal burning, and the Dongguan Industrial Zone emits 1,600 tons of soot annually. Just these two sources result in an annual emission of 63 tons of soot per square kilometer. The industrial silicon factory in the county seat is located in the Dongguan residential area, and the soot emissions from its No. 2 furnace exceed the harmless standard by 27 times. River pollution is also worsening. The waste water from the Yangquan coal mine and the steel plant both flow into the Tao River, turning the river water black, causing the disappearance of fish and frogs, and making it difficult for residents along the Tao River to access water. The Dashi Gate Reservoir has been polluted by upstream coal mine waste water and is no longer suitable for drinking.

Currently, pollution in some areas of our county is worsening, and the county's environmental protection department lacks strict and effective scientific inspection mechanisms. Some enterprises' contracts include only a few vague words about environmental protection investment. Relevant departments often turn a blind eye to enterprises that pollute the environment. We appeal to relevant departments to take measures to address the pollution problems in our county.

　　莫把治污当儿戏
    目前，我县地方工业欣欣向荣，乡镇企业年总产值超过３亿元，但环境污染也随之加重了。据有关部门测试，我县城关镇２８平方公里的上空，生活燃煤年排放烟尘１７５吨，东关工业区年排放烟尘１６００吨。仅此两项，每平方公里年排放烟尘６３吨。城关镇工业硅厂设在东关居民区，２号炉烟尘排放量超过无害标准２７倍。河流污染也在加剧。阳泉矿区洗煤水和钢铁厂的工业废水，都流入桃河，致使河水墨黑，鱼类和青蛙绝迹，桃河两岸居民吃水困难。大石门水库已被上游煤矿排出的废水污染，不能食用。
    现在，我县一些地方的污染日甚，县环保部门没有严格有效的科学检查机构。有些企业的承包合同中，环境保护投资条款虚词数言。有关部门对污染环境的企业，往往是睁一眼闭一眼。呼吁有关部门采取措施，治理我县的污染问题。
