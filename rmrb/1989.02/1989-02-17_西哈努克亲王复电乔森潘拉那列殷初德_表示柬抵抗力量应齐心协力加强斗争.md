Prince Sihanouk, Chairman of the Democratic Kampuchea, sent a telegram on February 14 from Beijing, stating that the three factions of the Cambodian national resistance forces should unite and work together to gain complete trust in the domestic and international arena for the historic and sacred national liberation struggle of Cambodia.

The telegram said that the resistance forces should demonstrate to the international community that "we will be able to restore true peace to our country and people, that is, the complete independence of Cambodia and the sacred and inalienable right of self-determination for the Cambodian people."

Prince Sihanouk's telegram was a reply to the Deputy Chairman of the Democratic Kampuchea in charge of foreign affairs, Chea Sim, Prince Sihanouk's personal representative in Cambodia and Asia, Ranariddh, and Yun Chakri, a member of the Defense Coordination Committee of the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea. It expressed gratitude for their congratulatory telegrams on his resumption of the chairmanship of the Democratic Kampuchea.

Prince Sihanouk's telegram said: "Your comprehensive support for me in the name of the dear Cambodian people and the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea during such a difficult period in our national liberation struggle has greatly encouraged me to continue to play a role in saving our country."

In their congratulatory telegram to Prince Sihanouk on February 13, Chea Sim, Ranariddh, and Yun Chakri said: "We are extremely delighted and deeply moved to learn that the national leader of Cambodia, the leader of the Cambodian national resistance forces, Prince Sihanouk, has graciously decided to resume your exalted position as Chairman of the Democratic Kampuchea." The telegram said that this decision would greatly encourage the Cambodian national resistance forces to unite more resolutely in their struggle against the Vietnamese invaders and to seek a solution to the Cambodian problem based on Prince Sihanouk's five-point peace plan.

　　西哈努克亲王复电乔森潘拉那列殷初德    
    表示柬抵抗力量应齐心协力加强斗争
    新华社北京２月１６日电  民柬主席西哈努克亲王２月１４日从北京发出的一封电报中说，柬埔寨民族抵抗力量的三派应齐心协力，以便使柬埔寨具有历史意义和神圣的民族解放斗争在国内和国际上赢得完全的信赖。
    电报说，抵抗力量应向国际社会表明“我们将完全能够使我们的祖国和人民重新获得真正的和平，即柬埔寨完全恢复独立、柬埔寨人民恢复神圣的和不可剥夺的自决权的和平”。
    西哈努克的电报是给民柬负责外交事务的副主席乔森潘、西哈努克驻柬埔寨和亚洲的私人代表拉那列和民柬联合政府国防协调委员会委员殷初德的复电，感谢他们为他恢复民柬主席职务发来贺电。
    西哈努克的电报说：“你们在我们民族解放斗争面临如此困难的时期，以亲爱的柬埔寨人民和民柬联合政府的名义给予我的全面支持，使我在为拯救我们的祖国继续发挥作用方面受到了巨大的鼓舞。”
    乔森潘、拉那列和殷初德２月１３日在打给西哈努克的贺电中说：“我们非常喜悦和深为感动地获悉柬埔寨民族领袖、柬埔寨民族抵抗力量领袖亲王殿下欣然决定恢复您的民柬主席的崇高职务。”贺电说，这一决定对柬埔寨民族抵抗力量在反对越南侵略者、争取在西哈努克亲王五点和平计划的基础上解决柬埔寨问题的斗争中更坚决地团结起来，是一个十分巨大的鼓舞。
