Recently, the author conducted an interview in a county in Anhui Province and discussed cadre work with the county's Communist Party Committee's Organization Department head. This Organization Department head candidly expressed his difficulties, revealing problems that were quite shocking. He said that currently, the problems in cadre work are prominently manifested in the "six disorders," namely, disorder in organizational setup, disorder in personnel quotas, disorder in rank and treatment, disorder in cadre assignments, disorder in professional title evaluations, and disorder in the number of leadership positions.

In the process of political system reform and streamlining of organizations, the number of county-level organizations has not decreased but has instead increased. In this county, the number of Party, government, and mass organizations was 44 in 1983, and now it has increased to 54; the number of internal departments was 156 in 1983, and now it has increased to 168. This does not include organizations where politics and business are combined, politics and administration are combined, and purely administrative organizations. Temporary organizations, which were fewer than 20 before 1983, have now increased to 86. According to the "Commission for Organizational Structure Reform," 67 of these can be abolished.

The number of cadres in the Party, government, and mass organizations in this county was 975 in 1983, and now it has exceeded this number by 167. When higher-level departments set up and expand organizations and increase personnel, the documents they issue often require that this be "resolved within the total quota," but in reality, it cannot be resolved within the total quota. From the county's situation, the configuration of leadership positions at the bureau level is relatively well-controlled, but the situation of exceeding the regulated number of cadre positions in departments, bureaus, and internal sections is prominent. In a certain bureau, a section with three people are all of the same rank, and the public jokingly calls it the "section chief section."

In terms of rank and treatment and professional title evaluations, various departments emphasize their own importance, pressing down from top to bottom, one level pressing the next. Recently, several units in a certain system have successively raised the ranks of their cadres, issuing numbers based on the percentage of in-quota cadres, not only causing internal contradictions but also sparking external discussions, with relatively strong reactions, putting a lot of pressure on the county committee's work. When evaluating professional technical titles, it is often not done according to conditions, and standards are not strictly adhered to, leading to favoritism, balancing, and even pulling strings and going through the back door, causing unscrupulous practices, making the work of evaluating professional titles quite chaotic. A responsible person in a certain unit, whose wife thinks he "doesn't recognize a single character," has managed to evaluate a mid-level title. Additionally, after evaluating professional technical titles, the issue of enjoying corresponding administrative position treatment has also caused mutual comparisons among cadres.

After the authority of cadre management was delegated downward, the transfer of a cadre in a county-level unit involves the county's responsible leader, the relevant department, the supervising bureau, the original unit, the individual, and the organizational personnel department, totaling 12 procedures for one transfer. With so many checkpoints, it is difficult to reach a consensus, not only causing various contradictions but also fostering unscrupulous practices of pulling strings and going through the back door.

The problems that have arisen in cadre work have both subjective factors in cadre management and objective factors in the new situation of facing competition, but the dominant factor is the subjective factor. How to rectify this? This county committee's Organization Department head, who has long been engaged in cadre work, believes that first, a complete set of systems needs to be established. From the setup of organizations and personnel quotas to the appointment, transfer, rewards, and retirement of cadres, there should be a series of complete systems, and work regulations should be formulated, with standardized procedures to follow. Second, the reform of the cadre personnel system needs to be deepened. Cadre work is a systematic project, and reform should be approached with a cautious attitude, both focusing on the internal reform of the cadre personnel system and conducting corresponding external reforms, coordinating and comprehensively managing, and not engaging in "deep penetration alone." Third, organizational discipline should be strictly enforced, emphasizing centralized unity, considering the overall situation, and ensuring that orders are followed, overcoming liberalism, and eliminating unscrupulous practices.

### 干部工作有“六乱”

　　干部工作有“六乱”
    谷佳
    最近，笔者在安徽省某县采访，与县委组织部长谈起干部工作。这位组织部长直言苦衷，反映的问题令人为之一震。他说，目前，干部工作的问题突出表现为“六乱”，即机构设置乱、人员编制乱、职级待遇乱、干部调配乱、职称评定乱和领导职数乱。
    在进行政治体制改革，精简机构的情况下，县机构非但没有减少，反而有所增加。该县党政群机构一九八三年为四十四个，现在增至五十四个；内设科室一九八三年为一百五十六个，现在增至一百六十八个。这还不包括政企合一、政事合一及纯事业机构。非常设性机构，全县一九八三年前不到二十个，现在增至八十六个，据“编办”调查，可以撤销的为六十七个。
    该县一九八三年党政群机关核定干部编制数九百七十五名，现在超编一百六十七名。上级部门增设扩大机构、增加人员时，所发文件中往往要求“在总编制中解决”，实际上总编制中解决不了。从县里情况看，局级领导职数配备控制的情况尚好，但部委办内设科室和局内设股，超规定配备干部职数的情况突出。某局一个股三人都是同一职级，被群众戏称为“股长股”。
    在职级待遇和职称评定方面，各条条强调各自的重要性，自上而下，一级压一级。最近，某系统的几家单位先后提高干部职级，采取按在编干部的百分比下达数字，不仅由此造成内部矛盾，同时又引起外部议论，反映较为强烈，给县委工作造成很大压力。评定专业技术职称，往往不按条件，不坚持标准，搞照顾、搞平衡，甚至拉关系，走后门，搞不正之风，致使职称评定工作比较混乱。某单位的一负责人，其妻都认为他“斗大的字不识一笆斗”，居然评上了中级职称。另外，在评定专业技术职称后，享受相应的行政职务待遇的问题也造成干部之间的互相攀比。
    干部管理权力下放以后，县直一个干部的调动，涉及到县分管领导、归口部门、主管局、本单位、本人、组织人事部门，一进一出共计经过十二道手续。这么多道关口，意见难以取得一致，不仅造成种种矛盾，也助长了拉关系、走后门的不正之风。
    干部工作中出现的问题，既有干部管理中的主观因素，也有新形势下面临竞争的客观因素，但主导方面是主观因素。如何治理？这位长期从事干部工作的县委组织部长认为，一要建立健全制度。大至机构、人员编制具体到干部任免、交流、奖惩、离退休等要有一系列完整制度，还要制订工作细则，有规范化的程序可循。二要深化干部人事制度改革。干部工作是系统工程，改革要持审慎的态度，既要着眼于抓好干部人事制度的内部改革，又要进行与之配套的外部改革，互相配合，综合治理，不搞“孤军深入”。三要严明组织纪律，强调集中统一，顾全大局，令行禁止，克服自由主义，杜绝不正之风。
