The Chinese team drew 0-0 with the Hong Kong team, and head coach Gao Fengwen believed this was the worst performance by the Chinese team in the three matches of the New Year Cup. Although the Chinese players had just returned from high-altitude training less than 10 days ago and were still in a state of fatigue, the players lacked subjective effort, drive, and fighting spirit. He believed that this time the Chinese team participated in the New Year Cup mainly to warm up for the World Cup qualifiers and to use this opportunity to observe the performance of each player in different positions, and finally to determine a relatively complete lineup. In this sense, the purpose of this participation has been achieved.

Chinese team coach Hu Zhigang believed that the Chinese team was unable to break through the opponent's goal in the three matches of the New Year Cup, not only because of poor shooting skills but also because of weak midfield organization and attacking ability.

Hong Kong team coach Guo Jiaming was satisfied with his players' performance. If it were not for the later fatigue of the Hong Kong players, they could have defeated the Chinese team with a full-force attack. The Hong Kong team's victory over the Danish team and draw with the Chinese team have boosted their confidence, which will be very helpful for the upcoming World Cup qualifiers. On April 30, the Hong Kong team will use the Shanghai-Hong Kong Cup to warm up again for the World Cup qualifiers.

Guo Jiaming believed that the Chinese team played cautiously and conservatively in the match against the Hong Kong team, failing to showcase their true potential. Compared to last year's Olympic final and the Asian Cup final, the current Chinese team is in a declining state. At the same time, the Chinese team's performance in this New Year Cup was not lively enough. In fact, as a warm-up match, the Chinese team should not have played so conservatively, completely losing the meaning of practice.

　　中国队表现如何　两教练各执一说    
    高丰文称　达到参赛目的    
    郭家明说　失去练兵意义
    中国足球队０∶０踢和香港队后，主教练高丰文认为这是中国队贺岁杯赛三仗中表现最差的一场。尽管中国队员刚从高原集训下来不到１０天，尚处疲倦状态，但队员主观努力不够，缺少拚劲和斗志。他认为，这次中国队参加贺岁杯赛，主要是为世界杯外围赛热身，并借机考察每个队员在不同位置的表现，最后再确定一个相对完整的阵容。从这点意义上说，此次参赛目的已达到。
    中国队教练胡之刚认为，中国队在贺岁杯三场比赛中始终无法攻破对方大门，不光是射门技术差，中场组织进攻能力也较差。
    香港队教练郭家明对他的球员表现感到满意，如果不是后来香港队员体力不济，大可以在全力出击下战胜中国队。香港队这次战胜丹麦队，踢和中国队，已经打出信心，对今后世界杯外围赛有很大帮助。４月３０日，香港队将通过沪港杯赛，为迎接世界杯外围赛再热身。
    郭家明认为，中国队与香港队比赛时打得较为拘谨、保守，未发挥出自己的水平。与去年奥运会决赛及亚洲杯决赛相比，目前这支中国队状态有回落趋势。同时，中国队在这次贺岁杯赛中表现不够奔放。其实，作为热身赛，中国队不应踢得如此保守，根本失去了练习的意义。
