The residents of Rongshui County in Guangxi face a perplexing contradiction: last spring, Rongshui County was awarded the "First-Class Award" by the Liuzhou Region for its target management responsibility system, which included an assessment of population control indicators. Subsequently, the county was issued a "yellow card" warning by the Autonomous Region Government for poor family planning work and a high rate of multiple births.

Statistics show that from 1980 to 1987, Rongshui County had 24,160 births exceeding the plan. In 1987, the county's birth rate reached 22.33 per thousand, with a multiple birth rate of 30.44%. Under these circumstances, how did Rongshui County manage to receive the "First-Class Award"?

The Liuzhou Region's assessment uses a percentage system. According to the assessment criteria, completing the planned population natural growth control rate and multiple birth control rate can earn the same ten points as completing industrial output value, agricultural output value, and township enterprise income, among other nine individual indicators. Thus, the shortcomings in Rongshui County's family planning work were easily overshadowed by the achievements in other areas. In the face of the "First-Class Award," the "yellow card" became meaningless.

Recently, the reporter saw that the situation in Rongshui County remains weak in family planning work, with the multiple birth rate still high. Notably, many officials in the county are still rushing to have children beyond the plan. Statistics show that from 1980 to 1987, 712 officials in Rongshui County had children exceeding the plan; by last year, 42 people were still rushing to have children beyond the plan. Just a month ago, a deputy secretary of the Tonglian Township Party Committee blatantly had a fourth child, disregarding party principles. Some officials who had children beyond the plan boasted, "We'd rather have descendants than party membership."

Moreover, among the many officials who had children beyond the plan in previous years, the vast majority were not punished, and some were still promoted. The public is indignant, "Those who eat state-provided food can have children beyond the plan, why can't farmers who till the land and raise children have more?" Thus, the door to excessive childbearing is wide open.

Some comrades have raised sharp criticisms: family planning work in Rongshui County is characterized by the main leaders saying little and doing nothing, while the responsible leaders and relevant departments are fighting alone. From the praise and criticism of the "First-Class Award" and the "yellow card" warning, it can be seen that the relationship between economic development and population has not been properly addressed. Family planning, as a fundamental national policy, needs a more complete management system in its implementation.

　　奖牌掩盖黄牌　干部带头超生
　　融水县经济增长人口失控令人忧
    据新华社南宁二月三日电  （记者杜新）广西融水人面对这样的矛盾而困惑：去年春天，融水县获得柳州地区颁发的目标管理责任制“特等奖”，这项奖包括了对控制人口指标的考核；接着，融水县因为计划生育工作不力、多胎率高，被自治区人民政府示以“黄牌”警告。
    有数字表明，从一九八○年到一九八七年，融水县共超生二万四千一百六十人；一九八七年，全县人口出生率达千分之二十二点三三，多胎率高达百分之三十点四四。在这种情况下，融水县何以荣膺“特等奖”？
    柳州地区的考核实行百分制。根据考核细则完成计划生育人口自然增长控制率与多胎控制率，可与完成工业产值、农业产值、乡镇企业收入等其他九个单项指标一样，获十分。于是融水县计划生育工作的缺陷，轻而易举地被其它工作的成绩掩盖了。在“特等奖”面前，“黄牌”也就形同虚设。
    记者最近在融水县看到的状况，依然是计划生育工作软弱无力，多胎率更是高居不下。尤其突出的是这个县的不少干部仍在抢孕超生。据统计，一九八○年到一九八七年，融水县超计划生育的干部多达七百一十二人；到去年，仍有四十二人抢孕超生。就在一个月前，同炼乡还有一位党委副书记置党性原则于不顾，强行超生了第四胎。一些超生的干部扬言：“宁要‘香火’，不要党票。”
    而且，在历年超生的众多干部中，绝大多数人未受处理，一些人照样受到重用。群众愤而不平：“吃皇粮的能超生，种田养娃的为什么不能多生？”超生之门因而大开。
    一些同志提出尖锐的批评：计划生育工作在融水县是主要领导少说不做，分管领导与有关部门孤军奋战。从“特等奖”与“黄牌”警告的褒与贬来看，经济发展与人口的关系尚未摆正，计划生育作为一项基本国策，执行中需要更加完备的管理体制。
