The United States has a type of very short and peculiar apple tree, which is unique in both its cultivation method and fruiting process.

People plant the saplings of these fruit trees at a spacing of 60 centimeters both between rows and within rows. In the first year, the saplings can grow to a height of 1 meter. In the second year, they can bloom and bear fruit without growing any taller. Each tree can produce 8 to 10 fruits. After the apples ripen, they hang in clusters on the short trees, resembling candy apples, and look very beautiful. During harvest, a specially designed combine harvester cuts the entire tree off near the ground. The separation, sorting, grading, and packaging of the fruits can all be done in one go. In the third year, new shoots sprout from the roots of the tree, and in the fourth year, the tree blooms and bears fruit again. Fertilizing, weeding, spraying pesticides, and harvesting these trees are all very convenient, thereby significantly increasing labor productivity.

Because these fruit trees are very short, from a distance they look like a lush meadow. Therefore, people metaphorically call this type of fruit tree a "grassland orchard."

　　神奇的“草地果园”
    美国有一种非常矮小而奇特的苹果树，无论是种植方法还是开花结果都与众不同。
    人们把果树的幼苗按６０厘米的株距和行距定植，第１年幼苗就可长到１米高，第２年即可开花结果并不再长高，每棵树可结８至１０个果实。苹果成熟后，成串地挂在矮小的果树上，样子很像糖葫芦，十分美观。收获时，用特制的联合收割机将整棵果树在贴近地面处割断，果实同果树分离、筛选分级、装箱等工作可一次完成。第３年果树根部又萌发新芽，第４年则再次开花结果。这种果树的施肥、中耕、喷药和收获都很方便，从而大大地提高了劳动生产率。
    因为这种果树十分矮小，远远望去恰似一片茂盛的草场，所以人们形象地称这种果树为“草地果园”。
