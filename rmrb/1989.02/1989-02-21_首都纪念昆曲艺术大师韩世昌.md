On February 19, the capital's Kunqu community held a special performance to commemorate the 90th anniversary of the birth of the late Kunqu master Han Shichang.

Han Shichang began studying Kunqu at the age of 11 in the Kunyi Qinglong class and performed in Beijing in 1917. In 1928, he led a Kunqu troupe to Japan, achieving great success. He was once praised as the "Kunqu King" for his exquisite artistry. In his later years, Han Shichang was dedicated to teaching, and his students are numerous. Today, renowned Peking Opera performers Bai Yuying and Zhang Eyun in Taiwan are among his disciples.
