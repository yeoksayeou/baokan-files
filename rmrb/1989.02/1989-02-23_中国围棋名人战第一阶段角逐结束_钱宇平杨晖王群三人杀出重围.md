The first round of the Chinese Weiqi Masters Tournament has concluded. Indeed, women are not inferior to men. Cao Dayuan, a 9th dan player, was eliminated midway, while his wife, Yang Hui, a 7th dan player, advanced through four rounds to become the only female player to enter the second round of the second Chinese Weiqi Masters Tournament.

The first round of the tournament, which featured 48 top domestic Weiqi players, began on February 16. After three rounds of competition, today, along with Yang Hui, the other two players who advanced are Qian Yuping, a 9th dan player, and Wang Qun, an 8th dan player. Interestingly, these three players all drew black and won their respective matches in the middle game.

The organizers of this tournament, the People's Daily Overseas Edition and the Chinese Weiqi Association, have decided that the three victorious players today will, in July and August of this year, compete with Nie Weiping, Ma Xiaochun, Yu Bin, Cheng Xiaoliu, and Yang Jinhua in a round-robin format to vie for the right to challenge the defending champion, Liu Xiaoguang.

　　中国围棋名人战第一阶段角逐结束
    钱宇平杨晖王群三人杀出重围
    本报北京２月２２日讯  记者缪鲁报道：果然是巾帼不让须眉，曹大元九段中途落马，而他的夫人杨晖七段却连闯四关出线，成为进入第二届中国围棋名人战循环圈唯一的女棋手。
    有４８位国内围棋高手参加的名人战第一阶段角逐，是从本月１６日开赛的。经过三轮对弈，今天，和杨晖一同出线的另两位棋手是钱宇平九段和王群八段。无独有偶，这三位棋手都是猜得黑棋，又都是中盘战胜各自对手的。
    主办本届名人战的人民日报海外版和中国围棋协会已经决定，今天获胜的三位棋手将于今年七、八月间，与聂卫平、马晓春、俞斌、程晓流和杨晋华五人通过大循环赛方式争夺向上届名人刘小光的挑战权。
