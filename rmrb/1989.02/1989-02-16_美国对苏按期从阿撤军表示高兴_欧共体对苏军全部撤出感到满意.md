The White House said today that the United States is "obviously very pleased" that the Soviet Union will complete its withdrawal from Afghanistan by February 15 as scheduled.

White House spokesman Fitzwater told reporters that the withdrawal is proceeding and that the Soviet Union appears able to complete the withdrawal of its troops by the deadline set in the Geneva Accords.

A spokesman for the Soviet Foreign Ministry said the last Soviet soldier will leave Afghanistan by the final deadline stipulated in the agreement. As of February 14, only 40 Soviet personnel remained in Afghanistan.

Fitzwater added that it is up to the Afghan people to decide what kind of government will emerge in Afghanistan after the Soviet withdrawal, and the United States will not play a "direct role" in this. However, Fitzwater also said, "The United States will continue to be interested in this region."

President Bush reiterated at last week's National Security Council meeting that the United States will continue to provide military aid to the Afghan resistance to counter Soviet support for the Kabul regime.

The foreign ministers of the 12 member states of the European Economic Community held their 73rd meeting of European Political Cooperation in Madrid today.

A statement signed by the 12 foreign ministers said the European Economic Community is satisfied with the Soviet Union's decision to complete its withdrawal from Afghanistan by February 15. They believe that this action is an important step toward a political solution to the Afghan problem.

The 12 foreign ministers expressed support for the efforts of the United Nations Secretary-General to establish a truly independent government in Afghanistan.

Regarding Afghan refugees, the 12 foreign ministers pointed out that the international community should help them return to their homes freely and safely.

    新华社华盛顿２月１４日电  白宫今天说，美国对苏联将按期于２月１５日完成从阿富汗撤军“显然很高兴”。
    白宫发言人菲茨沃特对记者说，撤军工作正在进行，苏联看来能在日内瓦协议规定的期限内把军队撤完。
    苏联外交部的一位发言人说，最后一名苏联士兵将在协议规定的最后期限离开阿富汗。到１４日为止，只有４０名苏联官兵仍在阿富汗。
    菲茨沃特还说，苏联撤军后阿富汗将出现什么样的政府应该由阿富汗人民去决定，美国不会对此发挥“直接的作用”。但菲茨沃特又说，“美国将继续对这一地区感兴趣。”
    布什总统曾在上星期五的国家安全委员会会议上重申，美国将继续向阿富汗游击队提供军事援助，以抵消苏联对喀布尔政权的支持。
