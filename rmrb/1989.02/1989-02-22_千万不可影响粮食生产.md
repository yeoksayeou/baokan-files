	Do Not Affect Grain Production

	In many rural areas of our city, there is a tendency to prioritize tobacco over grain in the arrangement of this year's crop planting plans. Recently, we conducted a "hundred villages, thousand households" survey. The surveyed households plan to allocate 89,033 mu of land for grain this year, a decrease of 1,547 mu from last year; and 16,769 mu for tobacco, an increase of 2,817 mu from last year. The reasons for this phenomenon are: first, our region experienced a severe drought last year, resulting in a high tobacco yield. Additionally, the state appropriately increased the price of tobacco leaves, making tobacco cultivation several times more profitable than grain cultivation. Second, some farmers believe that having money means having grain, so a slight reduction in grain land area is acceptable.

	I believe that blindly expanding tobacco cultivation while reducing grain land is not appropriate. If farmers across the country adopt the mindset of "having money means having grain" and stop growing grain, where will the money come from to buy grain? How will the issue of people eating and using grain be resolved? Therefore, it is crucial not to prioritize money over grain, affecting grain production.

### 千万不可影响粮食生产

　　千万不可影响粮食生产
    我市不少乡村在安排今年农作物种植计划时，存在重烟轻粮的问题。最近，我们搞了“百村千户”调查，被调查的农户今年计划安排粮田面积８９０３３亩，比去年减少１５４７亩；安排种植黄烟１６７６９亩，比去年增加２８１７亩。出现这种现象的原因：一是由于我们这里去年天气干旱，黄烟产量高，加之国家适当提高了烟叶价格，种黄烟比种粮收入高出几倍；二是一些农民认为，有钱就有粮，粮田面积减少点没关系。
    我认为，盲目扩大黄烟种植面积，缩小种粮面积，是不妥当的。如果全国农民都抱着有钱就有粮的想法，都不种粮食了，那么，有钱到哪里去买粮呢？人们吃粮和用粮问题怎么解决呢？因此，千万不可重钱轻粮，影响粮食生产。
