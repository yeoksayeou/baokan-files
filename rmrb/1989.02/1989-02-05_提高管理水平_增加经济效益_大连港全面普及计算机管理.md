	Improve Management Levels and Increase Economic Benefits
	 Dalian Port Fully Implements Computer Management

	Xinhua News Agency reports: Recently, while reporting from Dalian Port, our reporter saw that the application of computers has been fully implemented here. The office of the port authority's director has terminals for querying ship dynamics, and major departments and units at the division level and above all use computers for data processing and management assistance.

	Dalian Port is one of the earliest ports in China to apply computers. In 1979, the port authority's leadership, based on an analysis of the prospects for modernizing the port, made the decision to manage the port using computers. Today, the entire port uses computers in more than ten systems and over a hundred programs for data processing, management assistance, decision support, process control, and design assistance, significantly improving management levels. For example, analyzing ship stoppages in the port and statistics on throughput are essential statistical items that were difficult to complete manually in the past. Now, all information from a ship's forecasted arrival to its departure is processed by the computer, which can produce 14 dynamic queries and more than 20 types of reports. Accounting processing is also entirely handled by the computer.

	Computer management has improved the port's economic benefits. For instance, by analyzing the correlation between natural temperature and coal consumption, a large amount of coal has been saved. Currently, the port has over 80 computer professionals.

　　提高管理水平　增加经济效益
　  大连港全面普及计算机管理
    本报讯  记者江绍高报道：日前，记者在大连港采访时看到，计算机应用已经在这里普及，港务局局长室有查询船舶动态的终端，主要处室和基层处以上单位，都采用计算机进行数据处理和辅助管理。
    大连港是我国应用计算机最早的港口。１９７９年，港务局领导就在分析现代化港口发展前景的基础上，制定了用计算机管理港口的决策。如今，全港在数据处理、辅助管理、辅助决策、过程控制、辅助设计等十几个系统、上百个程序上用上了计算机，管理水平有了很大的提高。比如，船舶在港停时分析、吞吐量统计，是必不可少的统计项目，过去靠人工很难完成。现在船舶从预报进港到离港的一系列信息全部由计算机处理，可得出１４项动态查询和２０余种报表；账目处理也全部由计算机进行。
    计算机管理提高了港口的经济效益。如通过对自然温度与耗煤量之间相关关系的分析，节省了大量煤炭。现在这个港有计算机专业人员８０多名。
