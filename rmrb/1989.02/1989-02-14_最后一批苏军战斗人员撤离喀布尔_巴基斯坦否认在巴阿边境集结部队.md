The last batch of Soviet combat troops left Kabul at 2:30 PM local time today on a Soviet-made An-12 transport plane.

A senior officer from the Soviet military command in Kabul saw them off at the airport. The troops who left today included one platoon leader and 14 soldiers.

The senior officer said that the remaining Soviet officers will leave Afghanistan tomorrow or the day after. He added that, apart from a limited number of troops in the northern border area, there are no more Soviet combat troops left in Afghanistan.

He also revealed that the commander of the Soviet forces in Afghanistan, General Gromov, will go to the north and return to his country with the troops stationed there.

No ceremony was held at Kabul Airport today for the departure of the last batch of Soviet combat troops, and no high-ranking officials from the Kabul government came to see them off. As the plane carrying the soldiers took off, several military helicopters hovered over the airport and dropped strings of tracer bullets.

A Soviet diplomat said that the departure of these 15 Soviet soldiers can be seen as the complete withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan.

Islamabad, February 12 (New China News Agency) - The Pakistani government's foreign affairs spokesman today issued a statement refuting the allegations made by the Kabul government in Afghanistan that Pakistan has amassed troops on the Pakistan-Afghanistan border with the intention of splitting Afghanistan.

The spokesman stated that the Kabul government's claim is groundless.

　　最后一批苏军战斗人员撤离喀布尔   
    巴基斯坦否认在巴阿边境集结部队
    新华社喀布尔２月１３日电（记者马光、葛相文）最后一批苏联战斗人员于当地时间今天下午２点３０分乘一架苏制安—１２运输机离开喀布尔回国。
    苏军驻喀布尔司令部的一名高级军官到机场送行。今天离开的苏军人员包括１名连长和１４名士兵。
    这位高级军官说，其余苏联军官将于明天或后天离开阿富汗。他说，除了北部边境还有数量有限的部队外，已经没有苏联战斗部队留在阿富汗。
    他还透露说，驻阿苏军司令员格罗莫夫中将将到北部，同驻在那里的苏军一起回国。
    今天下午在喀布尔机场没为最后一批苏联战斗人员的撤离举行任何仪式，也没有一位喀布尔政权的高级官员来送行。当运载这些士兵的飞机起飞时，几架军用直升飞机在机场上空盘旋，并投下一串串曳光弹。
    一位苏联外交官说，可以把这１５名苏军的离开看作是全部苏军已撤离阿富汗。
    新华社伊斯兰堡２月１２日电　巴基斯坦政府外交发言人今天发表声明，对阿富汗喀布尔政权抗议巴基斯坦在巴阿边境结集部队，企图分裂阿富汗一事进行了批驳。
    发言人声明说，喀布尔政权的这种说法是毫无根据的。
