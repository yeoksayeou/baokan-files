The People's Navy has dispatched over 200 ships and more than 100 aircraft in the past year to participate in marine rescue and salvage operations. They have rescued 181 ships, both domestic and foreign, and saved 490 people who were in danger or ill.

The various naval fleets have upheld the spirit of humanitarianism, considering the rescue of ships and crew members in distress at sea as their duty. Whenever they receive a distress signal or a call for help, they immediately dispatch rescue ships and personnel to the scene of the accident. In June last year, the Brazilian 130,000-ton "Doxiporo" oil tanker encountered a problem in Jiaozhou Bay when an underwater chain got tangled in the propeller, causing the tanker to lose control and risk running aground or colliding with the pier. Upon hearing the news, a certain naval unit immediately dispatched four divers to eliminate the danger, allowing the tanker to resume safe navigation. On the evening of August 7 last year, Typhoon No. 7 struck the coast of Zhejiang, and a fleet of cement-laden barges from the Third Maritime Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Communications encountered danger in Hangzhou Bay. The naval vessel 862 from Zhoushan was ordered to provide assistance, towing three of the barges to a safe anchorage.

　　海军海上抢险救生作贡献
　　去年以来抢救中外遇险船只１８１艘
    据新华社北京电  （记者黄彩虹、通讯员兰荣生）人民海军去年以来派出舰船２００多艘次、飞机１００多架次参加海上抢险救生，抢救中外遇险船只１８１艘，救出遇险、患病海员和渔民４９０多人。
    海军各舰艇部队发扬人道主义精神，把抢救海上遇险船只和船员，作为自己应尽的义务。只要接到海上求救信号和求助电话，便派出救生船只、人员火速赶赴出事海区。去年６月，巴西１３万吨级“道西波罗号”油轮行至胶州湾时，海底铁链卷住了螺旋桨，油轮失去控制，随时有搁浅或与码头相撞的危险。海军某部闻讯立即派出４名潜水员排除险情，使油轮恢复安全航行。去年８月７日晚，７号台风袭击浙东沿海，交通部第三航务工程局装满水泥的驳船队在杭州湾遇险。驻舟山海军８６２船奉命前往救助，将驳船队３艘船只拖到了避风锚地。
