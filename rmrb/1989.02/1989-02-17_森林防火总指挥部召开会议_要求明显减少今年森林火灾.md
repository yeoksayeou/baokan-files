The State Forest Fire Prevention and Control Headquarters held a meeting today in Beijing, requiring a significant reduction in forest fires this year. Xinhua News Agency reporter Yu Fucang and People's Daily reporter Huang Caizhong report: Forest fire prevention must adhere to the principle of "prevention first, active extinguishment." The number of forest fires and the area of forest affected this year must be significantly reduced compared to last year, and efforts must be made to avoid major problems. This is the requirement put forward at the fourth plenary meeting of the State Forest Fire Prevention and Control Headquarters.

The meeting was presided over by State Forest Fire Prevention and Control Headquarters Director Tian Jiyun, who also delivered a speech. Tian Jiyun fully affirmed the active role played by various levels of people's governments, departments, the People's Liberation Army, and the masses in forest fire prevention. He emphasized that forest fire prevention work must be elevated to the level of realizing the Four Modernizations, protecting the ecological environment, and benefiting future generations. Forest fire prevention work must be thorough, detailed, and strict, with clear responsibilities, strict discipline, and clear rewards and punishments. It must be done diligently and conscientiously, and forest fire prevention must be effectively implemented.

According to materials provided at the meeting, in 1988, forest fire prevention work across the country achieved remarkable results. However, the meeting stressed that forest fire prevention is a long-term and arduous task. Currently, the forest fire prevention command structures in many places are not yet fully established, and preventive measures are not effective enough. Additionally, weather and other natural conditions have a significant impact on forest fires. Therefore, forest fire prevention work must not be relaxed or neglected and must be further strengthened.

This meeting deployed the forest fire prevention work for this year: First, all localities must fully implement the principle of "prevention first, active extinguishment," shifting the focus of forest fire prevention to strengthening fire source management and implementing various preventive measures at the grassroots level. Second, efforts must be made to improve the comprehensive fire-fighting capabilities of forest fire prevention, achieving "early detection, small-scale, and quick extinguishment." Third, accelerate the standardization and institutionalization of forest fire prevention, and establish a sound forest fire prevention system. Fourth, further improve the overall quality of the forest fire prevention team, enhancing the combat effectiveness and mobility of the professional forest fire prevention team. Fifth, the most urgent task at present is to do a good job in spring forest and grassland fire prevention. All localities should take timely preventive and extinguishment measures in response to the new situations and problems in spring forest and grassland fire prevention. Use the favorable period before the spring prevention to focus on training lookout, communication, and statistical personnel, and maintain and manage forest fire prevention vehicles and equipment.

　　森林防火总指挥部召开会议    
    要求明显减少今年森林火灾
    本报讯  新华社记者余富棠、本报记者黄彩忠报道：森林防火要坚持“预防为主，积极消灭”的方针，今年的森林火灾次数和受害森林面积要比去年明显减少，力争不发生大的问题。这是国家森林防火总指挥部今天在京召开第四次全体会议提出的要求。
    国家森林防火总指挥部总指挥田纪云主持会议并讲了话。田纪云充分肯定了各级人民政府以及各部门通力合作、互相支持及解放军和广大群众在森林防火中发挥的积极作用。他强调指出，一定要把森林防火工作提高到实现四化建设、保护生态环境、造福子孙后代的高度来认识。森林防火工作要抓早、抓细、抓狠，要责任到人，纪律严格，奖罚分明，要兢兢业业，勤勤恳恳，把森林防火切实抓好。
    据会议提供的材料，１９８８年全国森林防火工作取得了显著成绩。但会议强调，森林防火是一项长期而艰巨的任务。目前，不少地方森林防火指挥机构还不够健全，预防措施不够得力；另外，天气等自然条件对森林火灾的制约和影响很大。因此，森林防火工作，不能有任何松懈和疏忽，必须进一步加强。
    这次会议对今年的森林防火工作作了部署：一、各地要全面贯彻“预防为主，积极消灭”的方针，把森林防火的重心转到强化火源管理，把各项预防措施落实到基层。二、努力提高森林防火的综合扑救能力，实现“打早、打小、打了”。三、加快提高森林防火规范化、制度化的程度，建立健全森林防火体系。四、进一步提高森林防火队伍的整体素质，提高森林防火专业队伍的战斗力和机动能力。五、当前最紧迫的任务是抓好春季的森林和草原防火工作。各地要针对今年春季森林和草原防火工作的新情况和新问题，适时采取预防和扑救措施。要抓紧春防前的有利时机，重点搞好了望、通讯、统计人员的培训，维修、管理好森林防火的车辆和设备。
