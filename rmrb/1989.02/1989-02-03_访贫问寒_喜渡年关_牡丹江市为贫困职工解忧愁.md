The Spring Festival is approaching. In Mudanjiang City, Heilongjiang Province, more than 3,000 workers have not received their wages due to their enterprises' losses, and 362 households are facing difficulties in meeting basic needs. The city's top party and government officials led 10,000 cadres to visit the poor and help them solve their problems, bringing the warmth of the Party to the hearts of the impoverished workers.

In October last year, the Mudanjiang City Federation of Trade Unions began investigating and documenting the losses of enterprises and the difficulties faced by workers. The Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government, based on the suggestions of the Federation of Trade Unions, decided to use funds from the trade unions, system assistance, and public donations to help workers in loss-making enterprises receive their overdue wages and retirement benefits, and to provide subsidies to workers and their families in special difficulties.

Before the Spring Festival, party and government officials at all levels delivered relief funds and materials to the poor households, provided coal and firewood, and offered medical assistance. On January 26, Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee Tian Fengshan visited the home of retired worker Xu Hongfu from the Municipal Container Transportation Company and handed him 150 yuan in relief funds. Upon learning that Xu's 18-year-old son was unemployed, Tian instructed the accompanying personnel to help find a job. According to incomplete statistics, 120,000 party and government officials participated in the "Warmth Delivery" activities, visiting and comforting more than 3,400 poor households, distributing 1.06 million yuan in subsidies, and solving more than 5,000 practical problems such as employment for children, spouses living apart, housing shortages, and urban household registration. The large-scale "Warmth Delivery" and "Doing Good Deeds" activities have promoted the construction of spiritual civilization in society. The retired worker Yu Chengxi from the Mudanjiang City Freight Company has a family of eight people living in difficulty. His daughter Yu Jingbo suffers from Hodgkin's lymphoma, and the medical expenses have amounted to more than 5,000 yuan. After the news of the Municipal Party Committee's visit to his family spread, cadres, workers, elders, and children spontaneously donated more than 5,700 yuan to him. Yu Chengxi, tears streaming down his face, said, "My family owes it all to the Communist Party. Without the Communist Party, there would be no family like mine!"

Mudanjiang City's "Warmth Delivery" activities began in 1984 and have since become a popular and effective traditional activity.

　　访贫问寒　喜渡年关
    牡丹江市为贫困职工解忧愁
    本报讯  春节临近，黑龙江省牡丹江市内３０００多名职工因企业亏损领不到工资，３６２户特困户无力解决温饱。市党政主要领导带领万名干部访贫问苦，帮助排忧解难，把党的温暖送到贫困职工的心上。去年１０月，牡丹江市总工会开始对亏损企业和困难职工进行调查摸底、编卡立档。市委、市政府根据总工会的建议决定采用工会拨款、系统资助、公开募捐等办法，给亏损企业的职工补发拖欠的工资和离退休费，补助特困户职工和家属。
    春节前，各级党政工干部给贫困户送救济金，发救济物资，送柴送煤，送医送药。１月２６日，市委书记田风山来到了市集装箱运输公司退休工人徐洪福家中，将１５０元救济金送给他。当田风山得知其１８岁的儿子没有工作时，便责成随行人员帮助解决。据不完全统计，全市参加送温暖活动的党政工干部１．２万人，走访慰问了３４００多户贫困户，发放补助款１０６万元，解决子女就业、夫妻异地、住房紧张、城市落户等实际困难５０００多件。大规模的送温暖、做好事活动，推动了社会的精神文明建设。牡丹江市托运公司退休工人于承喜一家８口人，生活困难，女儿于静波患格淋巴力综合症，支付医疗费５０００多元。市委书记慰问她家的消息传开后，干部、职工、老人、孩子自发捐款５７００多元送给她。于承喜泪流满面地说：“我这个家多亏了共产党。没有共产党，就没有我这个家啊！”
    牡丹江市送温暖活动是从１９８４年开始的，目前，已成为一个得民心、效果好的传统活动。
