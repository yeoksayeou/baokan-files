	Guangzhou Railway Bureau sincerely accepts the criticism from the readers who wrote to the fifth edition of your newspaper on December 28, 1988, regarding the rampant issue of ticket scalping in Guangzhou.

	Since 1988, the situation of high-priced resale of train tickets around Guangzhou Railway Station has been quite severe. Our leadership has repeatedly visited Guangzhou Railway Station to understand the situation and organized relevant units to study countermeasures. In 1988, the Guangzhou Railway Public Security Bureau and the Guangzhou Railway Public Security Sub-bureau, in conjunction with the station police station, apprehended a total of 7,294 ticket scalpers. Among them, 6 were arrested, 25 were sent to labor camps, 264 were administratively detained, and 14,225 tickets were seized. The value of the seized tickets and the confiscated illegal proceeds amounted to over 600,000 yuan. This has effectively cracked down on the illegal activities of ticket scalping and stabilized the public order at the station.
