The British Navy Department is currently installing a device designed for escaping from the deep sea in the event of a submarine accident. This was revealed recently at a submarine protection technology conference held in London.

According to analysis, the most likely location for a submarine accident is the European continental shelf, where the water depth is 180 meters and the water pressure is 19 times the atmospheric pressure. The deep-sea escape device is designed based on this depth. This escape device is a tower-shaped structure that can accommodate only one person.

　　英海军研究深海逃生技术
    新华社伦敦２月１５日电  （记者王国瑞）最近在伦敦召开的海底防护技术会议上透露，英国海军部正在安装一种当潜艇发生事故后从深海海底逃生的装置。
    据分析，最可能发生潜艇沉没事故的地方是水深为１８０米的欧洲大陆架，此处海水压力为大气压力的１９倍。海底逃生装置就是根据这个深度设计的。这种逃生装置是只能容纳１个人的塔形结构。
