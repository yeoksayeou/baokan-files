In recent years, the scale of wedding and funeral ceremonies in rural areas has been growing larger, imposing an unbearable burden on some farmers. For instance, in November 1988 alone, our village held 30 such events. For weddings: starting from finding a partner, visiting the bride's family, engagement, to the wedding ceremony, childbirth, and the one-month celebration; for funerals: from placing the coffin cover, wearing mourning clothes, hiring a band to the funeral procession, and the first anniversary of the death, and so on, each step requires a banquet. A single wedding or funeral can cost over 1,500 yuan. There is a young man in our village who got married over four years ago, and he still hasn't paid off his debts.

　　西郊村大办婚丧事令人头痛
    近年来，农村办婚丧事的场面越来越大，给一些农民带来难以承受的负担。例如，１９８８年１１月我村就办了３０起婚丧事。婚事：从找对象开始，看家、订婚、到完婚、生小孩、做满月；丧事：从上棺罩、穿孝服、请吹鼓手到出殡、死人做周年，等等，每个环节都要摆酒席，一次婚丧事办下来，少说需花１５００元以上。村里有位青年娶下媳妇已４年多了，至今外债还没有还清。
