Title: The Tragedy of a Female Graduate Student and the Tragedy of More Women

A female graduate student was abducted and sold to a farmer to be his "wife." When she refused, she was forcibly taken advantage of. After much torment, the victim was finally rescued, and the perpetrator was sentenced to prison. This was a sensational news story last year, and some magazines are still reprinting it this year.

The reason this incident became a big news story is not because of the abduction and sale of women itself—this has long been old news. In Yuncheng, Shandong, there have been countless such cases. The reason it became a big news story is because of the stark contrast in knowledge and status between the graduate student and the illiterate farmer.

Many publications have titled this incident with phrases like "heavy reflection," urging people to ponder: Why did a "proud child of the times" fall for this so easily? Why didn't the graduate student, who was raped and humiliated, seek legal assistance? Although I deeply sympathize with the graduate student's plight and feel that blaming the victim is a bit unfair, I still think the questions are valid. Not just this graduate student, but also those who were not graduate students and were deceived, perhaps they have their own weaknesses.

However, I believe there is an even more profound aspect worth considering.

Regardless of the location, let's just talk about Yuncheng. There are thousands of families who have bought "wives," so why was only the buyer of the female graduate student, Gong Chang'en, sentenced? How many of those innocent women were willing to suffer such humiliation? The common people dying is not news; a VIP getting a scratch on his finger is news. I admit this. But this is in terms of the value of news; in terms of personal dignity and citizen rights, in a democratic society, is there still a distinction between high and low, noble and humble?

Regarding this, the party branch secretary of the location where the "buying wives" incident occurred had some insightful words. He said, "If she (the female graduate student) had told me her background earlier, her identity as a Communist Party member, I would have said anything to prevent her from suffering such great humiliation. The state does not easily cultivate a talent!"

These words are indeed moving, like a model of talent appreciation. It seems he has the ability and means to "prevent" the deceived women from "suffering such great humiliation." However, those who are not noble, not party members, and are not considered talents, I'm sorry, they just have to suffer.

Local authorities holding such views, the law thus becomes biased—other "buying wives" people are naturally guiltless, some are still living peacefully with the wives they deceived and bought who have not yet escaped. Gong Chang'en's crime is only that he mistakenly bought the wrong person! I can't help but feel indignant. I think the law protected the female graduate student; it is just. The law could not protect the victims who are not graduate students; it cannot be said to be fair. The law punished the criminal Gong Chang'en; it is strict. The law did not punish more of those who forcibly bought "wives"; it cannot be said to be strict. This is an even greater tragedy.

The law of a civilized society recognizes only one principle: that all people are equal, with no distinction between high and low, noble and humble. The law does not decide lawsuits based on high or low status; the law does not determine punishments based on the size of one's background. Strictly enforcing this principle, protecting the legal rights of all citizens, and cracking down on any evil doers' criminal activities, this is the foundation for maintaining normal social order and the most effective measure for eradicating such ugly phenomena as the trafficking of women.

### 一个女研究生的悲剧和更多妇女的悲剧

　　一个女研究生的悲剧和更多妇女的悲剧
    王乾荣
    一位女研究生被拐骗，卖给一个农民做“媳妇”，前者不从，被后者强行占有，几经折磨的受害者终于被救，施暴者也被判处徒刑。这是去年轰动一时的新闻，今年一些杂志还在转载。
    这件事之所以成为大新闻，并不在拐卖妇女本身——这早已是旧闻了，发生此案的山东郓城就有无数起——而在于研究生与文盲农民之间知识、地位的强烈反差。
    很多报刊对此事冠以“沉重思考”之类的标题，启发人们去沉思：为什么一个“时代的骄子”会轻易上当？为什么遭到强暴凌辱的研究生不去寻求法律的救援？尽管我十分同情研究生的遭遇，觉得如此责问受害者有点过分，但我还认为问题提得好。不光这个研究生，那些非研究生被骗者，或许有她们本身的弱点。
    然而，我以为还有更值得深思的一面。
    且不管它地，单说郓城，买“媳妇”的有千百家，为什么只有买女研究生的宫长恩被判刑呢？那么多无辜妇女横遭蹂躏，有几个心甘情愿？平民死了不算新闻，要人指头划个口子也是新闻，这我承认。但它是就新闻的价值而言的；从人格尊严和公民权利上来说，在一个民主社会里，难道还有什么尊卑贵贱之分吗？
    对此，买“媳妇”事件所在地的党支部书记有一段妙言，他说，“她（女研究生）如果早告诉我她的身世，她的共产党员的身份，我说啥也不能让她受这么大的委屈。国家培养一个人才不容易呀！”
    这番宏论实在动人，俨然一个惜才模范。可见他有能力、有办法“说啥也不让”被骗妇女“受这么大委屈”。不过不高贵的，不是党员的，称不上人才的，对不起，就只好“委屈”点了。
    地方当权者持如此观点，法律于是也势利起来——其他买“媳妇”的人理所当然地无罪，有的还在心安理得地和骗来、买来而未及逃脱的“媳妇”过着日子嘛。宫长恩之罪，只在他稀里糊涂地错买了人呀！我不禁有点愤愤然。我以为，法律保护了女研究生，它是公正的；法律不能保护不是研究生的受害者，它就不能说是公平的。法律惩罚了罪犯宫长恩，它是严明的；法律未能惩处更多的强行买“妻”者，它就谈不上严明。这才是一个更大的悲剧。
    文明社会的法律只认一个理，那就是人人平等，上下尊卑，概莫能外。法律，它不凭地位高低决诉讼；法律，也不看“来头”的大小量刑罚。严格实行这一原则，保护所有公民的合法权益，打击任何邪恶者的犯罪勾当，这才是维护正常社会秩序之本，才是根治诸如拐卖妇女之类丑恶现象的最有效措施。
