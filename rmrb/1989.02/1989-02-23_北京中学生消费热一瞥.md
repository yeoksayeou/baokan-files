Title: A Glimpse into the Consumer Fever Among Beijing Middle School Students

A consumer fever is quietly rising among Beijing middle school students, with a trend of competing to buy foreign goods.

It is reported that a sports goods company in Beijing sells forty to fifty pairs of "Nike" sneakers daily, with more than half of them bought by middle school students. The price for each pair ranges from 60 to 80 yuan.

Boys prefer branded clothes, while girls focus on styles. A shirt with six holes from Adidas is what some students aspire to have, even if it costs dozens of yuan; a bottle of "Ponds" wrinkle cream priced at 12 yuan is also in high demand, despite the buyers being just teenagers. Despite the "Middle School Student Conduct Guidelines" prohibiting students from perming their hair, some girls cannot resist the urge to imitate foreign movie stars and spend 30 yuan to get a "smooth steel plate" hairstyle at a salon.

Among Beijing middle school students, "mini-salons" are popular. Those with higher social status gather in cafes, where a seat costs 1 yuan and a cup of coffee costs 5 yuan. After chatting and eating some snacks, they spend around 20 to 30 yuan. Those with lower status find a corner to sit, smoke "Marlboro" cigarettes, and chat, or smoke domestic brands like "Red Mountain" or "A-Shima."

Middle school students do not earn money themselves but compete to adopt foreign consumption habits while retaining the traditional Chinese practice of being supported by their parents. It is understood that among them, those who feel ashamed to ask their parents for money are still a minority. Most still envy (or are jealous of, at least not disdainful of) those lucky enough to have a "good dad." Many students, regardless of their family's financial situation, frequently make high material demands on their parents. They measure their parents' love for them by how much their desires are fulfilled. A female student once proudly told her friends that her parents agreed to hire a band for her birthday, even though her parents are just ordinary intellectuals.

Currently, it is easy to make money from middle school students, and parents are helplessly meeting their children's growing material desires. They may not realize that this behavior is actually fostering the children's dependence, extravagance, and weakness.

The soft-boned syndrome among middle school students has become a significant social issue. However, there are also students like those from the Beijing Middle School Students' News Agency who advocate for self-reliance. These "young journalists" work part-time during holidays, trying to rely on their own strength to navigate and establish themselves in society. Perhaps among them and those with similar awareness, a strong generation will be forged!

### 北京中学生消费热一瞥

　　北京中学生消费热一瞥
    本报记者  孟晓云
    在北京中学生中，一股攀比“洋消费”热正悄然兴起。
    据悉，北京一家体育用品公司每天卖出四五十双“耐克”运动鞋，其中一半以上被中学生买走，其价格每双６０至８０元。
    男装要选名牌，女装讲究式样，一件衣服上挖６个洞的阿迪达斯运动衫是一些中学生所向往的，几十元一套也要设法买到手；“旁式防皱霜”１２元一瓶也争相购买，虽然还是十几岁的孩子……尽管《中学生行为规范》规定中学生不许烫发，一些女孩子还是按捺不住模仿外国影星的欲望，花３０元到发廊去做“无缝钢板”式发型。
    在北京的中学生中“小沙龙”盛行。层次高一些的，三五结伴去咖啡厅，一个座位１元，一杯咖啡５元，大侃一通，再吃些点心，二三十元出去了；层次低一些的，几个人找个角落一坐，一边吸“万宝路”，一边侃大山，也有抽中国烟的，那大多是“红塔山”或“阿诗玛”。
    中学生自己不挣钱，却争先学习洋人的消费，又固守国人的传统——由大人养着。据了解，在他们中间，以在父母面前当“伸手派”为耻的，仍属少数；多数人还非常羡慕（或者嫉妒、至少不是藐视）那些“有个好爸爸”的幸运儿。许多中学生不管家庭收支情况，却经常对父母提出过高的物质要求，他们以自己的欲望得到满足的程度来衡量父母对自己的爱。有一个女中学生曾得意地向伙伴们宣称，她过生日时父母答应为她请一个乐队，而其父母不过是一对普通的知识分子。
    时下，赚中学生的钱很容易，作父母的万般无奈去满足子女日益膨胀的物欲。他们也许未尝想到，这样做恰恰助长了孩子的依赖心理、奢侈习惯和软弱无能。
    中学生的软骨症成为一大社会问题。但是也有像北京中学生通讯社同仁那样崇尚自立的人。这些“小记者”利用假期勤工俭学，尝试着靠自己的力量在社会上闯荡和立足。也许，在他们以及与他们有相同意识的少年之中会锻造出坚强的一代！
