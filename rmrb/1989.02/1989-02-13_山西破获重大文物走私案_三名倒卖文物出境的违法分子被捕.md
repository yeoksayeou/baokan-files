Shanxi Cracks Down on Major Cultural Relics Smuggling Case

Three Individuals Involved in Smuggling Cultural Relics Out of the Country Arrested

Reported by our newspaper, the public security authorities of Jinzhong, Shanxi Province, recently cracked a major case of cultural relics smuggling. The criminals Huang Bingjiang, Li Dianming, and Li Yu were apprehended, and 2,319 cultural relics along with a large quantity of ancient coins were recovered.

Since last October, Huang Bingjiang and his group of lawbreakers used the home of Li Dianming, an employee of Jinhua Textile Factory, as a contact point. They illegally purchased cultural relics in three separate instances in Jinzhong and Lvliang areas of Shanxi and then smuggled them out of the country for sale.

According to the appraisal by relevant experts from the Shanxi Provincial Cultural Relics Bureau, among these cultural relics, 21 items are classified as second-grade national cultural relics. These include a jade spade from the Shang Dynasty, a bronze tripod from the Eastern Zhou Dynasty, a bronze sword from the Warring States period, a group of Han Dynasty terracotta sheep, a Tang Dynasty bronze Buddha, and a Song Dynasty glazed bowl.
