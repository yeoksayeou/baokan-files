Recently, Japanese medical expert Dr. Morishita, after conducting research, believes that to make the human body strong and resist the cold, it is best to eat vegetables with their roots and skins.

Modern medical research suggests that vegetable roots can absorb minerals and nutrients from the soil. The mineral and nutrient content in the root and skin parts of vegetables is relatively higher. These minerals are closely related to human health and the ability to resist the cold. When the human body lacks iron, body temperature drops, leading to a feeling of coldness, especially in women.

Therefore, during the cold season, people can appropriately eat more vegetables with their roots and skins, such as burdock, lotus root, carrots, sweet potatoes, potatoes, and leafy greens. However, one should pay attention to the method of consumption. Generally, after washing them clean, do not peel the skin, then place them in a pot and cook slowly, consuming the soup along with the vegetables. This is because the soup contains a large amount of minerals, enzymes, and nutrients, allowing for the intake of more effective nutrients and enhancing the body's ability to resist the cold.

　　多食蔬菜根皮可御寒
    最近，日本医学家森下博士经过研究认为，要使人体健壮，抵御严寒，最好多食用连根带皮的蔬菜。
    现代医学研究认为，蔬菜的根可以吸收土壤中的矿物质和营养素，蔬菜根皮部的各种矿物质和营养素含量相对会多些。而矿物质又与人体健康、御寒能力密切相关。当人体缺铁时，体温有所下降，就会导致人们怕冷的感觉，尤其是妇女。
    因此，在寒冷季节，人们可以适当地多食些连根带皮的蔬菜，如牛蒡、藕根、胡萝卜、山芋、薯类和青菜等。但要讲究食用方法，一般说来，先洗净，不要削皮，然后放在锅里慢慢煮，连汤一同食用。因为，菜汤里溶有大量的矿物质、酶类物质和营养素，这样，可以多摄取有效的营养素，增强御寒能力。
