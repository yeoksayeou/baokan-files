Fujian Province Strengthens the Targeted Nature of Situation Education

    BEIJING, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) -- Fujian Province has achieved initial success in its situation education by focusing on investigating the facts, telling the truth, doing practical work, and moving people with sincerity.

    To enhance the targeted nature of situation education, leaders at various levels in Fujian Province have conducted investigations and research, timely understanding the thoughts of different groups in various fields. They have set different requirements for different objects, such as cadres, workers, residents, and farmers, with a focus on Party members, especially county-level and above Party leaders, for targeted education. In October last year, the Propaganda Department of Zhangzhou Municipal Committee organized three teams to survey 48 units, including government agencies, enterprises, and schools, involving 1,546 people and distributing 1,317 questionnaires. They basically grasped the public's mindset: they are satisfied with the achievements of the 10-year reform, believe that the overall policy of reform and opening up is correct, and see significant improvements in family life. However, they are concerned about the implementation of the rectification and rectification policies, complain about soaring prices, and detest corruption.

    The Propaganda Department of the Provincial Party Committee, based on the feedback from 13 different types of contact points in cities such as Xiamen, Fuzhou, Quanzhou, and Jianyang, required local areas to focus on the "hot spots" in people's understanding as the key content of education. They combined education with rectification, using education to promote rectification.

    Fujian Province's situation education has avoided the phenomenon of propaganda departments fighting alone. Leaders and the masses have been open and direct in their dialogues, with propaganda departments, economic departments, Party and government agencies, and mass organizations working together to create a socialized education synergy. In late October last year, the leaders of the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Government, starting from the perspective of respecting, understanding, and caring for people, frequently engaged in dialogues with non-Party personnel. Some democratic personages sharply pointed out that the market price of vegetables has risen to an unbearable level. The main leader of the Provincial Party Committee sincerely explained his personal feelings about the price increase, understanding the public's complaints, and honestly introduced the measures taken by the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government to stabilize vegetable prices: first, allocating 1.1 million yuan to subsidize farmers affected by disasters in Fuzhou, Zhangzhou, Xiamen, and Quanzhou; second, strengthening the construction of vegetable bases. Democratic personages felt that the provincial leaders understood the situation and the measures were feasible, so they felt closer to the Party and the government. Local and county leaders also paid attention to dialogues with the masses at the grassroots level to unify the understanding of cadres and the masses. On December 23 last year, Chen Xiu Mao, the Secretary of the Ningde County Committee, and County Magistrate Chi Songguang had a dialogue with more than 430 cadres and workers in a tea factory, helping some workers to change their overly high expectations for reform into an "idealistic" mindset, correcting egalitarian thoughts, and establishing a spirit of contributing more to reform and opening up and jointly overcoming difficulties. Huang Wenlin, the Secretary of the Jianyang Regional Committee, and other leaders had a dialogue with more than 10 agricultural entrepreneurs and specialized households in Jiyang Town, Jianou County, exchanging views on issues such as cheating, misleading, and harming farmers in rural areas, and jointly discussing solutions. Leaders at all levels also fully utilized various propaganda channels for situation education, such as organizing essay contests and holding exhibitions, using facts, objects, and charts to move people with sincerity.

    Over the past three months, as situation education has deepened and rectification measures have been implemented, Fujian Province has further seen a new situation of public stability and improved market environment.

### 查实情　说实话　办实事　以实感人  福建省增强形势教育针对性

　　查实情　说实话　办实事　以实感人    
    福建省增强形势教育针对性
    本报讯  福建省在形势教育中，各级领导注意查实情，说实话，办实事，以实感人，初见成效。
    为了增强形势教育的针对性，福建省各地领导进行调查研究，及时摸准各领域各阶层群众的思想脉搏，分别对干部、职工、居民、农民等不同对象，提出不同要求，以党员特别是县级以上党员领导干部为重点，有的放矢地教育。去年１０月，漳州市委宣传部组织了３个组，调查了４８个机关、企业、学校的１５４６人，问卷１３１７份，基本掌握了群众心态：对１０年改革成绩是满意的，认为改革开放的总方针是正确的，家庭生活提高是明显的，却担心治理整顿的政策落实不了，埋怨物价飞涨，憎恶腐败现象。省委宣传部根据从厦门、福州、泉州、建阳等１３个不同类型联系点的反映，要求各地把人们认识上的“热点”作为教育的重点内容，边教育边整治，以教育推动整治。
    福建省进行形势教育，避免了宣传部门孤军作战的现象，领导与群众肝胆相照，直接对话，宣传部门与经济部门、党政机关与群众团体齐抓共管，群众自我教育，形成了社会化教育的合力。去年１０月下旬，省委和省人民政府领导以尊重人、理解人、关心人为出发点，经常与党外人士对话。有的民主人士尖锐地提出，市场蔬菜价格高到令人难以承受的程度。省委主要领导人既坦诚说明自己对物价上涨有切肤之感，理解群众的埋怨情绪；又如实介绍了省委和省府平抑蔬菜价格的措施：一是拨款１１０万元，补助福州、漳州、厦门和泉州等地受灾菜农；二是加强蔬菜基地建设。民主人士感到省级领导了解实情，措施可行，因此，心与党和政府近乎多了。各地、县领导也都重视到基层与群众对话，统一干部群众的认识。去年１２月２３日，宁德县委书记陈修茂和县长池颂光在茶厂与４３０多名干部、职工对话，帮助部分职工改变对改革期望值过高的“理想主义”，纠正平均主义思想，树立为改革开放多做贡献、共度难关的精神。建阳地委书记黄文麟等领导同志，与建瓯县吉阳镇１０多名农民企业家和专业户对话，就农村中出现的坑农、误农、害农等问题交换了意见，共同协商了解决办法。各级领导还充分运用各种宣传渠道进行形势教育，例如开展征文、举办展览等活动，用实事、实物、实图，以实感人。
    ３个多月来，随着形势教育的日益深入和治理整顿措施的落实，福建全省进一步出现人心安定、市场环境改善的新局面。
