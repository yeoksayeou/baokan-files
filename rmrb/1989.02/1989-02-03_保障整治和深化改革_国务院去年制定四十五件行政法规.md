The past year of 1988 saw the State Council issue 45 administrative regulations. The promulgation and implementation of these regulations have played a positive role in deepening reforms, promoting opening up to the outside world, establishing a new order for the commodity economy, and transforming government functions to make government work more standardized and legalized, especially in implementing the central government's policies on rectifying economic order and improving the economic environment. The State Council's Legislative Affairs Office held a press conference today to introduce the situation and characteristics of the administrative regulations issued last year and announced that this year, a batch of new administrative regulations will be formulated around the themes of improving the economic environment, rectifying the economic order, and promoting clean governance.

Serving the rectification of the economic order, improving the economic environment, and establishing a new order for the commodity economy was a prominent feature of the administrative regulations issued in 1988. Regulations such as the "Interim Provisions on the Management of Prices for Key Industrial Raw Materials and Transportation," the "Interim Measures for the Management of Nationwide Uniform Maximum Prices for Non-plan Industrial Raw Materials," and the "Interim Provisions on Administrative Sanctions for Corruption and Bribery by State Administrative Personnel" provided necessary legal guarantees for curbing inflation and price increases and establishing a commodity economy order.

Ensuring and promoting the deepening of economic system reforms was a key focus of the administrative regulations issued in 1988 and will continue to be a focus this year. To ensure the implementation of the Enterprise Law, this year will focus on formulating supporting regulations for the Enterprise Law. To promote opening up to the outside world, regulations will be drafted and formulated around expanding opening up, attracting foreign investment, and introducing advanced science and technology and management experience. This includes regulations on the inspection of imported and exported goods, the management of foreign trade imports and exports, and implementing regulations for the Foreign Investment Enterprise Law and the Law on Sino-Foreign Equity Joint Ventures.

In 1988, legislative work was actively carried out in the fields of education, science and technology, health, military, civil affairs, and government agencies. To revitalize the education sector and protect the legal rights of teachers, this year, it is necessary to study and formulate the Education Law, the Teacher Law, and regulations to promote the development of science and health. The Food Hygiene Law will also be revised.

The spokesperson of the Legislative Affairs Office also announced at the press conference that this year, regulations and provisions will be formulated to protect citizens' basic rights and maintain social stability and unity.

　　保障整治和深化改革
    国务院去年制定四十五件行政法规
    本报北京２月２日讯  记者晓渡报道：过去的１９８８年国务院共制定行政法规４５件。这些法规的发布与施行，对于深化改革，促进对外开放和建立商品经济新秩序，以及转变政府职能，使政府工作规范化、法律化，特别是对贯彻中央关于整顿经济秩序，治理经济环境的方针，起到了积极作用。国务院法制局在今天举行的新闻发布会上介绍了去年行政法规制定的情况与特点，并宣布：今年将围绕治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序，推进为政清廉等方面制定一批新的行政法规。
    为整顿经济秩序、治理经济环境、建立商品经济新秩序服务，是１９８８年制定行政法规的显著特点。其中如《重要生产资料和交通运输价格管理暂行条例》、《计划外生产资料全国统一最高限价暂行管理办法》、《国家行政机关工作人员贪污贿赂行政处分暂行规定》等，对抑制通货膨胀和物价上涨，建立商品经济秩序，提供了必要的法律保障。
    保障和促进经济体制改革的深化，是１９８８年制定行政法规的重点，也是今年要继续注意的重点。为保证企业法的实施，今年要抓企业法配套法规的制定。为促进对外开放，要围绕扩大对外开放、引进外资，引进先进的科学技术和先进的管理经验，起草制定进出口商品检验、外贸进出口管理等项法规，外资企业法实施、中外合作经营企业法实施等项条例。
    １９８８年积极开展了教育、科技、卫生和军事、民政、机关方面的立法工作。为振兴教育事业，维护教师的合法权益，今年需要研究制定教育法、教师法，以及促进科学、卫生发展方面的法规，还要修定食品卫生法。
    法制局的发言人还在新闻发布会上宣布：今年还要就保护公民的基本权利，维护社会安定团结方面，制定有关的条例和法规。
