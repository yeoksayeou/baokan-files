	Reflections on Books
	Yan Tingkui

	I would cut the land of Huaihai into 32 pages
	Bind it into a book and publish it
	The brave warriors who fought in those days
	Each person occupies only one character
	But it is still very thick
	The price is quite expensive (actually not even a third of a pack of Zhonghua cigarettes)
	No one asks for it
	I shed tears
	I do not cry for not completing the quota
	I cry, only for
	The blood of the martyrs and the lives of the soldiers being neglected
	The symphony of hand grenades and cannon shells has no appreciators
	The stories of laborers and generals pushing carts will turn into pulp
	While those absurd heroes, legends, and love stories
	Unusually popular
	The book only lies in the glass case of the exhibition hall
	The cover of history is covered with dust
	The national spirit and heroic spirit of a generation
	Perhaps will forever be buried under this dust
	Waiting for future generations
	To excavate
	When history appears fragmented
	The spine of philosophy will also bend
	I cannot help but shed tears

　　书之沉思
　　颜廷奎
    我将淮海大地裁成３２开
    装订成一部书　出版
    当年参战的勇士
    一个人只占一个铅字
    然而还是很厚
    价格挺贵（其实不及一盒中华烟的三分之一）
    无人问津
    我流泪了
    我不为没完成承包数流泪
    我流泪，只为
    烈士鲜血战士生命受到冷落
    手榴弹与炮弹交响的乐章没有知音
    民工与将军推车的故事将化作纸浆
    而那些荒诞的侠客、传奇、情史却
    超乎寻常的走俏
    书　只在陈列馆的玻璃柜中躺着
    历史的封面积满了灰尘
    民族浩气英雄精神一代风流
    也许永远要埋于这尘埃之下
    等待后人
    挖掘
    历史出现断层的时候
    哲学的脊骨也会弯曲
    我不能不流泪
