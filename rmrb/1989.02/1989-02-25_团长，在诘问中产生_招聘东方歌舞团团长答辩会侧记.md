The Director, Born Amidst Inquiries
— A Record of the Debate for the Director of the Oriental Song and Dance Troupe

By Chen Yuan, Reporter for This Newspaper

	Question: The Oriental Song and Dance Troupe’s art is an important part of learning and performing foreign works, with a strong international flavor. Are you prepared to maintain this characteristic?
	Question: The Oriental Song and Dance Troupe’s current performances are mostly popular songs and dances, which is a fact. How will you handle this?
	Question: What is your management policy? What is the artistic style you envision for the Oriental Song and Dance Troupe?
	…The questioners pressed on, firing questions like cannonballs; the answerers thought intensely, struggling to respond. Half an hour of reading the “policy manifesto,” half an hour of debate. The atmosphere was serious, even somewhat “severe.” Thirteen evaluation committee members sat upright on the evaluation committee seats, including music and dance industry luminaries and high-ranking officials from the Ministry of Culture such as Ying Ruocheng, Fang Jie, Liu Wengin, and Jia Zuoguang. The audience seats were crowded with news reporters, Oriental Song and Dance Troupe performers and staff, and others from various arts troupes who had come to observe; there were also cultural figures such as Wang Kun, Li Guyi, and Zhang Jun. On either side of the evaluation committee seats were the notary public seats and the debater seats. The Beijing Dongcheng District Notary Public Office would notarize the entire bidding process.

	This was the rehearsal hall of the Oriental Song and Dance Troupe on February 22. The Ministry of Culture’s Art Bureau held a day-long “Debate for the Director of the Oriental Song and Dance Troupe” here.

	There were six candidates who submitted bids to apply for the position. Hu Zuodong is the current personnel director of the Oriental Song and Dance Troupe, speaking with a clear and resonant voice. Ni Shengquan is a regular official in the personnel department of the Art Bureau, the youngest at 41 years old, but full of enthusiasm. Xing Dehui’s position is the deputy director of the Oriental Song and Dance Troupe, having served as a dance director for many years, speaking and acting steadily. Wu Hua is a creator for the Oriental Song and Dance Troupe, with over a thousand musical works to his name. Wang Li is mature and composed, holding the position of chairman of the Oriental Arts Building, and although he is 59 years old, his demeanor is still very elegant. Gao Zhiping graduated from the Shanghai Conservatory of Music, serving as the performance director of the Oriental Song and Dance Troupe, having done everything from directing and producing to solo performances.

	The six candidates were passionate and enthusiastic when reading their “policy manifesto,” or bid, revealing their ambition to take command of the Oriental Song and Dance Troupe and achieve remarkable results in three years, making the world take notice of “Oriental.” Hu Zuodong discussed the merits and demerits of “Oriental” thoroughly; Ni Shengquan had detailed plans for the future economic benefits of “Oriental,” even inviting ten companies to provide economic support, with the manager of the Beijing-Hai Computer Group and the manager of the People’s Theater personally assisting; Xing Dehui was familiar with the art of “Oriental”; Wu Hua had the unique skill of rehearsing several large-scale new works; Wang Li presented the economically powerful Oriental Arts Building under his jurisdiction to support the future “Oriental”; Gao Zhiping believed that the problem with “Oriental” lay in management, thus proposing a plan to reform the organization. Although the six candidates had different strengths, they all felt the same about “Oriental” having a glorious history, but now being in a state of decline, with dispersed morale and artistic fatigue.

	However, most of the audience also had a common feeling: the weaknesses of the six candidates were very prominent, even some fatal weaknesses. The evaluators seemed to be more aware of this. The questions they asked often hit the mark, to the point where the answerers sometimes had no words to respond or answered incorrectly. Among the questioners, Ying Ruocheng and Jia Zuoguang were the most prominent. Ying started from the answerers’ confusion, such as the root cause of “Oriental’s” decline, whether “Oriental’s” artistic stagnation was due to singing popular songs, whether ticket prices and the audience were considered, etc. His words were sharp, making the audience unable to contain themselves. A middle-aged female performer, disregarding the rule that the audience was not allowed to ask questions, shouted loudly, and the audience also became restless.

	After the meeting, the audience was divided on who could take the lead, probably because the shortcomings of each person made them all unfit for the job. However, one must be chosen from among them, and that will be decided by the evaluators’ votes. As for how the chosen director will perform in the future, Ying Ruocheng had a sentence that could serve as an answer: If the successful bidder can learn the strengths of the other five, that would be the wisest choice.

　　团长，在诘问中产生
    ——招聘东方歌舞团团长答辩会侧记
    本报记者  陈原
    问：东方歌舞团艺术的重要部分是学习、表演外国的作品，具有强烈的国际色彩，你是否准备保持这一特点？
    问：东方歌舞团目前的演出多以流行歌舞为主，这已成事实，对此，你将如何处理？
    问：你的治团方针是什么？你设想的东方歌舞团的艺术风格是什么？
    ……问者步步紧逼，炮弹连珠；答者紧张思索，穷于应对。半小时的宣读“施政纲领”，半小时答辩。环境严肃，甚至还有些“严厉”。评委席上正襟危坐着十三位评议委员，英若诚、方杰、刘文金、贾作光……均为音乐、舞蹈界名流和文化部高级官员。听众席拥挤着新闻记者、东方歌舞团演职员以及其它文艺团体赶来旁听的人；还有王昆、李谷一、张均等文艺界人士。评委席的两侧是公证人席和答辩人席，北京市东城区公证处将对投标招聘的全过程实行公证。
    这是２月２２日东方歌舞团的排练厅。文化部艺术局在此地举行了一天的“招聘东方歌舞团团长答辩会”。
    投标请求应聘者共６人。胡作栋现任东方歌舞团人事处长，讲话抑扬顿挫，声音宏亮。倪胜泉为艺术局人事处普通官员，年龄最小，４１岁，但热情洋溢。邢德辉的职务是东方歌舞团团长助理，当过多年的舞蹈编导，言辞举止稳重。吴华是东方歌舞团的创作人员，曾有上千音乐作品问世。王犁老成持重，位居东方艺术大厦董事长之职，虽年届５９岁，风度仍很洒脱。高志平毕业于上海音乐学院，任东方歌舞团演出队长，编导、总监、独唱演员行行都干过。
    ６位投标人在宣读“施政纲领”，也就是投标书时慷慨激昂，透露出非要执掌东方歌舞团帅印，三年内做出一番惊人事业，令世人刮目相看“东方”的勃勃雄心。胡作栋对“东方”的功过是非论得头头是道；倪胜泉在“东方”未来的经济效益方面颇有筹划，以至请出十家企业作经济后援，京海计算机集团公司经理和人民剧场经理还亲自出马助阵；邢德辉对“东方”艺术了如指掌；吴华以排练几部大型新作为投标的“独家本领”；王犁端出属辖有经济实力的东方艺术大厦作未来“东方”的姊妹支持“东方”；高志平认为“东方”弊端在于管理，于是提出一套机构改造的构想。尽管６人的“拿手戏”各异，但对“东方”曾有过光辉的历史，而现状萎靡不振、人心涣散、艺术疲惫，却感受相同。
    然而大多数听众又都有一致的感觉，６个人的弱点都十分突出，甚至是一些致命的弱点。评委们对此似乎更为清楚。所提问题，多能击中要害，以致答者有时竟无言以对，或者答非所问。提问者中尤以英若诚、贾作光为甚。英从答者之糊涂处开刀，如“东方”不振的症结在何处、“东方”艺术的停滞是不是因演唱流行歌曲所致，票价和观众是否考虑了，等等。言辞锋利，迫得听众都按捺不住。有位中年女演员不顾听众不许发问的禁规，竟高声呼唤，听众亦随之骚动不已。
    会后，听众对何人可执牛耳莫衷一是，大概这由于每人的缺陷使他们都难以胜任。然而又必须从中选择一人，那得由评委投票决定了。至于选出的团长今后怎样办，英若诚有一句话可以作为回答：如果中标者能学来其他五人的长处，那是最明智的。
