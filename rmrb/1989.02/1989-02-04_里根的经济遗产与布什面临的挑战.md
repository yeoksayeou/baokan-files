The "Reagan economic revolution" helped the U.S. economy gradually escape stagflation, achieving the goal of sustained economic growth under low inflation. However, it also left behind the significant hidden dangers of rapidly increasing fiscal and trade deficits. Bush faces severe challenges in budget deficits, improving the competitiveness of U.S. goods in the global market, and maintaining U.S. leadership in technology.

Before stepping down, former President Reagan delivered an emotional farewell speech to the American people, declaring that during his tenure, the U.S. experienced a "great rediscovery," achieving what he considered his two greatest victories: one being "economic recovery," and the other being "restoring our morale: America is once again respected in the world, and people expect America to take the lead." Reagan said he would accept the term "Reagan Revolution."

Reagan took on the responsibility of leading the U.S. at a time when America's economic position was declining and the world was undergoing significant changes. In the 1970s, the Western economy was mired in the "stagflation" dilemma, and the U.S. economic situation was even more disheartening: the annual growth rate of the gross national product dropped from 3.8% in the 1960s to 2.8%, the unemployment rate rose from 4.6% to 6.3%, and the inflation rate increased from 2.8% to 7.8%. By 1980, the U.S. economy had negative growth of 0.2%, the unemployment rate had risen to 7.1%, and the inflation rate was as high as 13.6%. This phenomenon of economic stagnation and inflation coexisting shook the dominance of Keynesian theory for nearly half a century. After Reagan took office, on February 18, 1981, he proposed an ambitious "Economic Recovery Plan," which people called "Reaganomics" or the "Reagan economic revolution."

Reagan's "Economic Recovery Plan" included four major economic goals: (1) Reduce government spending to achieve a balanced budget by the fiscal year 1984; (2) Implement large-scale tax cuts to stimulate consumption and investment; (3) Reduce regulatory restrictions on businesses to encourage competition; (4) Strictly control the money supply to curb inflation.

How should we view "Reaganomics"? Opinions vary. The U.S. "Business Week" commented that "Reaganomics" left a mixed legacy—low tax rates and low inflation rates, prosperity bought through borrowing, and an imbalanced economy—which will affect the U.S. as it enters the 21st century. This means that by some standards, the "Reagan economic revolution" achieved success, but by other standards, it left significant hidden dangers.

The "Reagan economic revolution" achieved the following main successes:

First, the U.S. economy gradually escaped stagflation, achieving the goal of sustained economic growth under low inflation.

The U.S. economy began to recover in late 1982 and has since grown for over six years, making it the longest period of economic growth in U.S. history during peacetime. During this period, the U.S. real gross national product averaged an annual growth rate of 4.2%; nearly 19 million jobs were created, and the unemployment rate dropped to 5.3%, the lowest in 14 years; the inflation rate, which dropped to 4.3% in 1982, has been controlled below 5% ever since; the enterprise operating rate reached 84.2%, the highest since the late 1970s. Some industry sectors have operating rates exceeding 90%, but products are still in short supply.

Second, significant progress was made in technological upgrading and industrial structure adjustment.

Since 1980, the U.S. has increased its investment in industrial research and development by an average of 10.3% per year and its investment in information technology by an average of 16.1% per year. With increased investment and technological development, traditional industrial sectors have competed to adopt high technology for enterprise upgrades, and many enterprises have regained their vitality. A recent report stated that the sales revenue of the U.S. information technology industry has increased from $174.4 billion in 1980 to $423.7 billion in 1988, and is expected to reach $864 billion by 1998, accounting for more than 10% of the U.S. gross national product, thus becoming one of the largest industries in the U.S.

However, as some U.S. newspapers have pointed out, the "Reagan economic revolution" also left significant hidden dangers for the U.S. economy.

First, the fiscal deficit has been increasing rapidly due to years of budget imbalances. During Reagan's eight years in office, the cumulative fiscal deficit was $1,338.2 billion, more than the total fiscal deficit of all previous presidents combined over 204 years.

Second, foreign trade is severely imbalanced, with a rapidly increasing trade deficit. During Reagan's term, the U.S. experienced a trade deficit every year, totaling $861.5 billion from 1981 to 1987. This reflects the decline in the competitiveness of U.S. goods.

The trade deficit has fundamentally changed the U.S.'s international balance of payments. In 1981, the U.S. was still the world's largest creditor nation, but by 1985, the U.S. had debts totaling $111.9 billion, making it the world's largest debtor nation. By the end of 1987, U.S. foreign debt had risen to $368.2 billion. A report by the U.S. Economic Development Commission believes that this change will mean a reduction in the living standards that the next generation of Americans may achieve. This is a legacy that previous generations have never left for their children since the Civil War.

New President Bush took the oath of office on January 20 to become the new master of the White House. Bush has said that his feelings are: "both very happy and acknowledging the severe challenges ahead."

The first challenge Bush faces is the budget deficit problem. The fiscal deficit for the 1988 fiscal year was $155.1 billion, and further reductions will not be easy.

The second challenge Bush faces is whether he can improve the competitiveness of U.S. goods in the global market. Since the 1980s, the rise and fall of the dollar's exchange rate have been just one factor influencing changes in U.S. foreign trade. If the comprehensive competitiveness of U.S. goods cannot be improved, it will be difficult to change the unfavorable position of U.S. foreign trade.

Another severe challenge Bush faces is whether he can maintain leadership in the technology sector. Currently, the U.S. technology level still has a certain advantage over other industrialized countries, but it faces fierce competition from Japan and Western European countries, especially as the gap in high technology between Japan and the U.S. is narrowing.

The U.S. is still the world's number one economic power, with strong endurance, adaptability, and responsiveness. The economic policies that the Bush administration will implement will have a significant impact on whether the U.S. economy will rise or decline in the 1990s and as it enters the 21st century.

　　里根的经济遗产与布什面临的挑战
　　李长久
    内容提要：“里根经济革命”使美国经济逐步摆脱滞胀，实现了在低通货膨胀条件下经济持续增长的目标。但它也留下了财政、外贸赤字急剧增加的巨大隐患。布什面临着预算赤字、提高美国商品在世界市场上的竞争能力和保持美国在科技领域的领先地位等方面的严峻挑战。
    前总统里根在卸任前向美国人民发表充满感情的告别讲话中宣称，在他任职期间，美国经历了一次“伟大的再发现”，取得了他最引以自豪的“两大胜利”：一是“经济恢复”；一是“恢复了我们的士气：美国在世界上再次受到尊敬，人们期待美国担当领导”。里根说，他将接受“里根革命”这个词语。
    里根是在美国经济地位下降、世界处于大变革历史时刻担负起领导美国重任的。７０年代，西方经济陷于“滞胀”困境，美国经济形势更令人沮丧：国民生产总值年均增长率由６０年代的３．８％降至２．８％，失业率从４．６％上升到６．３％，通货膨胀率从２．８％上升到７．８％。到１９８０年，美国经济负增长０．２％、失业率上升到７．１％，通货膨胀率高达１３．６％。这种经济停滞和通货膨胀并存现象动摇了凯恩斯主义理论近半个世纪的统治地位。里根入主白宫后，于１９８１年２月１８日提出了一个雄心勃勃的《经济复兴计划》，人们称它为“里根经济学”或“里根经济革命”。
    里根的《经济复兴计划》包括四大经济目标：（一）削减政府开支，到１９８４年度实现预算收支平衡；（二）大规模减税，以刺激消费和投资；（三）减少对企业的规章制度限制，鼓励竞争；（四）严格控制货币供应，抑制通货膨胀。
    如何看待“里根经济学”？人们评说不一。美国《商业周刊》评论说，“里根经济学”留下的混合遗产——低税率和低通货膨胀率，靠借贷买来的繁荣和不平衡的经济——将在美国进入２１世纪时产生影响。这就是说，按某些指标衡量，“里根经济革命”是有成就的，但按另一些指标衡量，却留下了巨大隐患。
    “里根经济革命”取得了以下的主要成就：
    第一，美国经济逐步摆脱“滞胀”，实现了在低通货膨胀条件下经济持续增长的目标。
    美国经济自１９８２年底开始复苏，迄今已持续增长６年有余，是美国历史上和平时期经济增长持续时间最长的。在这一时期，美国的实际国民生产总值平均每年增长４．２％；共创造了近１９００万个就业岗位，失业率已降至５．３％，为１４年来的最低水平；通货膨胀率自１９８２年降至４．３％以后，一直控制在５％以下的低水平上；企业开工率达到８４．２％，为７０年代末以来的最高水平。有些产业部门的企业开工率高达９０％以上，但产品仍是供不应求。
    第二，在技术改造和产业结构调整方面取得明显进展。
    自１９８０年以来，美国用于工业领域的研究和开发投资平均每年增加１０．３％，用于信息技术产业的研究和开发投资平均每年增加１６．１％。随着投资增加和科技发展，传统工业各部门竞相采用高技术对企业进行技术改造，很多企业重新恢复了活力。最近发表的一项报告说，美国信息技术产业的销售额已从１９８０年的１７４４亿美元增加到１９８８年的４２３７亿美元，预计到１９９８年将达到８６４０亿美元，占美国国民生产总值的１０％以上，从而成为美国的最大产业之一。
    然而，正如美国一些报刊所指出的，“里根经济革命”也给美国经济留下巨大隐患。
    第一，连年收支失衡，财政赤字急剧增加。里根执政８年累积财政赤字为１３３８２亿美元，比以前历届总统在２０４年中累积的财政赤字总和还多。
    第二，对外贸易严重失衡，外贸逆差急剧增加。在里根任期内，美国外贸连年出现逆差，从１９８１年到１９８７年，美国外贸逆差总额达８６１５亿美元。这反映了美国商品竞争力的下降。
    外贸逆差使美国的国际收支地位发生了根本性变化。１９８１年美国还是世界最大债权国，到１９８５年美国负债达１１１９亿美元，成为世界上最大的债务国。１９８７年底，美国的外债已上升到３６８２亿美元。美国经济发展委员会的一项报告认为：这一转变将意味着美国下一代可能达到的生活水准的降低。这是自南北战争以来前人从未给他们的孩子留下过的遗产。
    新总统布什已于１月２０日宣誓成为白宫新主人。布什曾说过，他的心情是：“既非常高兴，又承认面临严峻的挑战”。
    布什面临的第一个挑战，是预算赤字问题。１９８８财政年度预算赤字为１５５１亿美元，要进一步削减绝非易事。
    布什面临的第二个挑战，是能否提高美国商品在世界市场上的竞争能力。８０年代以来美元汇价的上升和下降，只是影响美国外贸形势变化的因素之一。如果不能提高美国商品的综合竞争能力，就难以改变美国对外贸易的不利地位。
    布什面临的另一个严峻挑战，是能否保持在科技领域的领先地位。目前，美国的科技水平与其他工业发达国家相比，仍占有一定优势，但受到来自日本和西欧国家的激烈竞争，特别是日本与美国在高技术水平上的差距正在缩小。
    美国现在仍是世界头号经济大国，拥有很强的承受能力、适应能力和应变能力。布什政府将实行什么样的经济政策，对９０年代和进入２１世纪的美国经济地位是回升还是下滑，将有重大影响。
