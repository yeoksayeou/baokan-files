After Gansu Province decided to repair small-scale agricultural water conservancy projects that had been destroyed over three years, local water conservancy departments at various levels adopted a tiered responsibility system to accelerate the repair of these projects. Currently, tens of thousands of facilities affected by floods, natural aging, and human damage have been basically repaired, and 1.12 million acres of farmland have resumed irrigation. It is estimated that this alone can increase grain production by about 150 million kilograms annually.

Most of Gansu Province's small-scale water conservancy projects were built in the 1960s and 1970s. By the end of 1985, 1.18 million acres of irrigated land could not be properly irrigated, accounting for 10% of the province's total irrigated land. In response to this situation, Gansu Province allocated 44.7 million yuan over three years for repair project expenses, and local governments and the public contributed an additional 40 million yuan annually. The construction work, such as canal dredging and land leveling, was completed by farmers volunteering their labor. By the end of 1988, a total of 3,345 kilometers of river embankments and canals, 2,276 pump stations, 6,914 wells, and more than 10,000 other buildings had been repaired. To prevent new instances of neglect and poor maintenance, Gansu Province has also implemented a management responsibility system for more than 30,000 small-scale irrigation, wells, ponds, reservoirs, and other projects, establishing a management and maintenance team of over 20,000 water conservancy workers and farmers.

    甘肃省３年恢复灌溉面积１１２万亩
    甘肃省做出３年修复被毁小型农田水利工程的决定后，省内各级水利部门采取层层包干的办法，加快对工程的维修。目前，因洪水冲毁、设施自然老化和人为破坏而影响灌溉的数万项工程设施基本修复，１１２万亩耕地恢复灌溉。据测算，仅此一项每年可增产粮食１．５亿公斤左右。
    甘肃省大部分小型水利工程建于六、七十年代，因种种原因，到１９８５年底，有１１８万亩水地不能正常灌溉，占全省灌溉地面积的１０％。针对这一情况，甘肃省财政３年共拨出４４７０多万元用于修复工程开支，各级政府和群众每年还集资４００多万元。修渠整地等土建工程则由农民义务投工投劳。到１９８８年底，共修复河堤、渠道３３４５公里，泵房２２７６座，机电井６９１４眼，其它建筑物１万多座。为了防止新的失管失修现象的发生，甘肃省还对３万多项小型提灌、机井、塘坝、水库等工程落实了管理责任制，建立了由水利职工和农民２万多人组成的承包管护队伍。
