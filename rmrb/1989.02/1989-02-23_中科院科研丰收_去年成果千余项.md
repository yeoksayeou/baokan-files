The Chinese Academy of Sciences achieved a bumper harvest in scientific research in 1988, with 1,028 research outcomes, including 867 significant achievements, accounting for 84.36% of the total. Among these, 53 items have applied for national patents.

According to the analysis, the Chinese Academy of Sciences completed 186 national research projects and 183 ministerial projects in 1988, yielding a series of major research achievements. Examples include the Beijing Electron-Positron Collider, the Lanzhou Heavy Ion Accelerator, the Kangfu series CAE workstations, and the Scanning Tunneling Microscope. This indicates that China has reached an advanced international level in certain high-tech fields.

At the recent Third National Natural Science Award Ceremony, 72 out of the 178 awarded projects were from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, accounting for 40.5% of the total awarded projects, leading all other departments. Out of the 11 projects that received the first-class award, the Chinese Academy of Sciences accounted for 7. Examples of these first-class award-winning projects include "Comprehensive Research on the Uplift of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and Its Impact on Natural Environment and Human Activities," "East Asian Atmospheric Circulation," and "Artificial Complete Synthesis of Yeast Alanine Transfer RNA," all of which are at the forefront of global scientific development.

Statistics show that out of the 1,028 achievements in 1988, 382 have been promoted and applied, generating economic benefits of 1.33 million yuan.

　　中科院科研丰收　去年成果千余项
    据新华社北京２月２２日电  （记者陈金武）中国科学院在科技丰收的１９８８年，取得科研成果达１０２８项，其中重要成果８６７项，占总数的８４．３６％。有５３项成果已申请了国家专利。
    据分析，去年中科院共完成国家科研项目１８６项，部委项目１８３项，取得了一批重大科研成果。如北京正负电子对撞机、兰州重离子加速器、康发系列ＣＡＥ工作站、扫描隧道显微镜等。这表明我国在高技术的某些领域已达到国际先进水平。
    在前不久举行的第三次国家自然科学奖授奖大会上获奖的１７８个项目中，中国科学院占７２项，占获奖项目总数的４０．５％，居其它部门之首。在获一等奖的１１个项目中，中国科学院占７项。如获一等奖的“青藏高原隆起及其对自然环境与人类活动影响的综合研究”、“东亚大气环流”、“酵母丙氨酸转移核糖核酸的人工全合成”等，都是处于世界科学发展前沿的研究成果。
    据统计，在去年的１０２８项成果中，已有３８２项推广应用，获经济效益１３３万元。
