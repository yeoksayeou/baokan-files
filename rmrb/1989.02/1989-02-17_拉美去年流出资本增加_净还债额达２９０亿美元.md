	Xinhua News Agency, Washington, February 15

	The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean's office in Washington announced today that Latin American countries paid off a net debt of $29 billion last year.

	According to the office, Latin American countries repaid a net debt of $17 billion in 1987; in the seven years since the debt crisis, Latin American countries have repaid nearly $180 billion in debt.

	The office said that in 1988, Latin America's net debt repayment was equivalent to one-quarter of the region's export earnings, compared to 15% in 1987.

	The office said that in 1987, the net capital inflow into the Latin American region was approximately $12 billion, while last year the net capital inflow was only one-third of that amount.

	Currently, the total external debt of the Latin American region is approximately $401 billion. According to the office, the actual debt amount in the region decreased by 6% last year. Due to the reduction in debt and the increase in exports, the proportion of debt interest payments to exports decreased by 2%, reaching 28%, the lowest level since 1981.

　　拉美去年流出资本增加    
    净还债额达２９０亿美元
    新华社华盛顿２月１５日电  联合国拉丁美洲和加勒比经济委员会驻华盛顿办事处今天宣布，拉美国家去年偿还债务净额为２９０亿美元。
    据该办事处说，拉美国家在１９８７年偿还债务净额为１７０亿美元；自债务危机以后的７年内，拉美国家已还债近１８００亿美元。
    该办事处说，１９８８年拉美偿还债务的净额相当于该地区出口额的１／４，１９８７年的比例为１５％。
    该办事处说，１９８７年净流入拉美地区的资本约１２０亿美元，去年净流入的资本额仅相当于１９８７年的１／３。
    目前，拉美地区的外债总额约４０１０亿美元。据该办事处说，去年该地区的债务实际额减少６％。由于债务额下降和出口增加，债务利息支付对出口的比重下降２％，降到２８％，为１９８１年以来的最低水平。
