	U.S. High-Level Officials' Pay Raise Proposal Rejected
	Fiscal Deficit Piles Up, Social Welfare Cut, Pay Raise at This Moment, Public Outcry

	Xinhua News Agency, Washington, February 7 - (Reporter Huang Yong) Under strong public opposition, the U.S. House and Senate today rejected the Reagan administration's proposal to give Congress members, federal judges, and cabinet members a 51% pay raise.

	The House of Representatives first voted 380 to 48 to reject the proposal. The Senate, which had voted against the pay raise last Thursday, voted again tonight, 94 to 6, to approve the House's resolution. A few hours later, President Bush signed the congressional resolution, effectively rejecting the pay raise for high-level officials just hours before it was set to take effect automatically.

	The proposal to significantly increase the salaries of high-level officials in the legislative, judicial, and executive branches sparked a strong public reaction after it was submitted to Congress last month. Many newspapers published numerous articles on the topic, and several local radio stations held special discussions on the pay raise issue, which boosted their listenership.

	Supporters of the pay raise argue that government officials earn less than their counterparts in the private sector and that this makes it difficult to attract top talent. However, many point out that high-level officials, especially Congress members, enjoy various special privileges that even some top executives of super-large companies envy. More people oppose the pay raise, citing the fact that the country's fiscal deficit is piling up and social welfare programs are being repeatedly cut, making it inappropriate for high-level officials to receive a pay raise at this time.

	According to public opinion polls, over 80% of Americans oppose pay raises for high-level officials. In the past month, Congress members have received hundreds or even thousands of protest letters and phone calls every day. A radio host in Detroit even initiated a campaign to mail tea bags to Congress members, using the historical example of Boston residents protesting British colonial rulers' tea tax to express public discontent with the pay raise for high-level officials.

	House leaders from both parties, with the support of some members, attempted to delay the vote to allow the pay raise proposal to take effect automatically. Due to pressure from voters, members began to "change sides," forcing House leaders to agree to put the proposal to a vote.

	Observers point out that the rejection of the pay raise proposal does not significantly harm Congress members, as many of them can earn more additional income through giving speeches, free travel, and other means. This practice has already been criticized by the media. To maintain the "integrity" of Congress, the Reagan administration included a clause in the pay raise proposal to prohibit accepting speaking fees and other additional income. However, this clause was rejected along with the pay raise.

### 美国高官加薪提案被否决　财政赤字累累　社会福利削减　此时此刻加薪　舆论一片哗然

　　美国高官加薪提案被否决
　　财政赤字累累　社会福利削减　此时此刻加薪　舆论一片哗然
    新华社华盛顿2月7日电　（记者黄泳）在公众的强烈反对之下，美国众参两院今天否决了里根政府提出的给国会议员、联邦法官和内阁成员加薪51％的议案。
    众议院先以380票对48票否决了该项议案。曾于上星期四投票反对加薪的参议院今晚再次投票，以94票对6票通过了众院的决议。几小时后，布什总统签署了国会的决议，使这项给高级公职人员增薪的议案在自动生效前几小时被否决。
    这项给立法、司法和行政部门高级官员大幅度增加薪金的建议在上月递交国会后，引起了美国公众舆论的强烈反响。许多报纸连篇累牍地刊登有关文章，不少地方电台举办加薪问题的专题讨论，使收听率激增。
    赞成加薪的人认为，同私营企业相比，政府部门官员收入较低，无法吸引优秀人才。但许多人指出，高级官员们，特别是国会议员，享有种种特殊待遇，连一些超级大公司的经理都自叹弗如。更多的人反对给高官提薪，理由是：目前国家财政赤字累累，社会福利计划屡遭削减，高级官员们不宜在这种情况下加薪。
    据民意测验统计，80％以上的美国人反对给高官们加薪。在过去一个多月里，国会议员几乎每天都收到成百上千的抗议信件和电话。底特律的一位电台广播员还发起向国会议员邮寄茶叶袋的运动，以当年波士顿居民抗议英国殖民统治者征收茶叶税的典故，来表示公众对高官加薪的不满。
    众院两党领袖在一些议员的支持下企图用拖延投票的方法使增薪提案自动生效。由于选民的压力，议员们又纷纷“反水”，迫使众院领袖同意将议案付诸表决。
    观察家们指出，加薪议案遭到否决对国会议员来说并无多大损失，因为许多议员都能以发表讲演，免费旅游等形式捞取更多的额外收入。这种作法已遭到了舆论界的非议。为了保持国会的“廉洁”，里根政府在加薪议案中加进了禁止收取演讲费等额外收入的条款。然而这个条款如今和加薪一起被否决了。
