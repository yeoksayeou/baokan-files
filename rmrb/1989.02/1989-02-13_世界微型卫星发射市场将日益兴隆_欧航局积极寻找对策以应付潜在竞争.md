The global micro-satellite launch market will become increasingly prosperous in the 1990s, with a promising future. Various types of micro-satellites will be launched consecutively, and starting from next year, more than 10 micro-satellites will enter orbit each year.

To welcome this market full of potential and to find strategies to cope with it, the European Space Agency held its first discussion on European launches of micro-satellites from February 8 to 10 in Frascati, Italy.

Micro-satellites, according to the classification standards of Arianespace for various satellites, refer to small satellites weighing less than 50 kilograms. They operate in low orbits, mainly for detecting Earth resources, communication, navigation, photographing weather clouds, and various scientific experiments conducted by scientists and radio amateurs.

Currently, the Soviet Union has launched the most micro-satellites into different low orbits, maintaining a network of 24 micro-satellites over the years. Since launching its first micro-satellite in 1981, the United Kingdom now also has two operational micro-satellites in orbit.

According to the February issue of Arianespace's "Bulletin," this year the company will launch two more such satellites for the United Kingdom and multiple satellites weighing only 10-15 kilograms for several U.S. research centers.

The cost of developing and launching micro-satellites is very low. Therefore, various national military departments will also show great interest in them. It is predicted that by 1995, various national military departments will flock to the micro-satellite market.

To meet the increasing launch demands, Arianespace has designed special equipment for carrying these micro-satellites and taken relevant launch measures.

According to reports, Arianespace launched 7 rockets last year, sending 13 satellites into orbit, with a revenue of 3.76 billion francs and a net profit of 1 billion francs.

According to signed contracts, it will launch 9 rockets this year, with the first one scheduled for launch between February 28 and March 1, during which a Japanese communications satellite and a European meteorological satellite will be simultaneously sent into orbit. In the next few years, 7-8 launches will be conducted each year.

　　世界微型卫星发射市场将日益兴隆   
    欧航局积极寻找对策以应付潜在竞争
    新华社巴黎２月１１日电  （记者茅瑞清）世界微型卫星发射市场进入９０年代后将日益兴隆，前景良好。各种用途的微型卫星将接连上天，从明年起，每年将有１０多颗微型卫星进入轨道。
    为迎接这个富有潜力的市场的到来和寻找对付的策略，欧洲航天局２月８日至１０日在意大利的弗拉斯卡蒂召开了第一次欧洲发射微型卫星的讨论会。
    所谓微型卫星，据阿丽亚娜航天公司对各种卫星的编级标准，是指重量低于５０公斤的小卫星。它在低轨道上运行，主要用于探测地球资源、通信、导航、拍摄气象云图，以及供科学家和无线电爱好者等进行的各种科学实验。
    目前，苏联发射进入不同低轨道的微型卫星数量最多，多年来一直保持着２４颗，形成了一个微型卫星网。英国从１９８１年发射第一颗微型卫星以来，现在也有两颗在轨道上工作。
    据阿丽亚娜航天公司２月出版的《信札》杂志报道，今年该公司将为英国再发射两颗这种卫星，为美国的一些研究中心发射多颗重量仅１０—１５公斤的４种卫星。
    研制和发射微型卫星的成本很低。因此，各国军事部门对它也将会产生很大兴趣。据预测，到１９９５年，各国军事部门将会涌向微型卫星市场。
    为满足越来越多的发射要求，阿丽亚娜航天公司已经设计出用于装载这种微型卫星的专门装置和采取了有关的发射措施。
    据报道，阿丽亚娜航天公司去年共发射７枚火箭，把１３颗卫星送入轨道，营业额达３７．６亿法郎，纯盈利１亿法郎。
    根据已签订的合同，它在今年将发射９枚火箭，其中第一枚预计在２月２８日—３月１日发射，届时将把一颗日本通信卫星和一颗欧洲气象卫星同时送入轨道。今后几年里，每年也将发射７—８次。
