	Squandering Resources on War and Wasteful Expenditure:
	Israel's Military Spending Increases by 17%

	Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, January 31

	According to news from Jerusalem, Israeli Finance Minister Peres today announced in the budget for the 1989-1990 fiscal year submitted to the parliament that military spending will increase from $5.05 billion to $5.9 billion.

	It is reported that the increase in Israel's military spending is to make up for the expenses needed to suppress the Palestinian struggle against Israel in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. To deal with the Palestinian people's struggle against Israel, the Israeli government needs to spend $14 million every month.

	Peres proposed to the parliament that the next fiscal year's budget expenditure will be $30.7 billion, with a deficit of $1 billion. He requested a 19% increase in government administrative expenses, which will be partially offset by reducing development projects and increasing taxes.

	The Israeli Labor Federation, which represents approximately 80% of workers, expressed opposition to Peres' budget. The organization believes that this budget will increase unemployment and raise food, transportation, and insurance costs to levels that workers cannot afford.

	According to estimates by Israeli television, the economic austerity plan will result in 4,000 government employees losing their jobs.

　　穷兵黩武　糜费钱财
    以色列军费开支增加１７％
    新华社开罗１月３１日电  据来自耶路撒冷的消息，以色列财政部长佩雷斯今天在向议会提出的１９８９—１９９０财政年度预算中宣布，军费开支从５０．５亿美元增加到５９亿元。
    据报道，以色列军费开支的增加是为了弥补在约旦河西岸和加沙地带镇压巴勒斯坦人反以斗争所需费用。为了对付巴勒斯坦人民的反以斗争，以色列政府每月需要耗资１４００万美元。
    佩雷斯向国会提出的下一年度预算支出为３０７亿美元，赤字１０亿美元。他要求增加政府行政开支１９％，此项开支将部分地由减少发展项目和增加税收等办法来填补。
    代表大约８０％工人的以色列劳工联合会表示反对佩雷斯的预算。该组织认为，这个预算将会使失业增加，使食品、交通费和保险费增加到工人无法承受的程度。
    据以色列电视台估计，经济紧缩计划将会使４０００名政府雇员失业。
