Chinese and Thai Foreign Ministers Hold Talks in Beijing
Focus on Deep Exchange of Views on Political Solution to Cambodian Issue

	New China News Agency, Beijing, February 10 — (Reporter Jiāng Lǔróng) Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and Thai Foreign Minister Siddhi Savetsila held talks today, agreeing that the resolution of the Cambodian issue has entered a crucial stage, and that enhanced consultations and sustained contacts among the relevant parties are of great importance. Qian Qichen and Siddhi held a three-and-a-half-hour talk, focusing on an in-depth exchange of views on the political resolution of the Cambodian issue. The talks were conducted in a sincere and friendly atmosphere.

	Both sides expressed support for Prince Norodom Sihanouk's efforts to achieve a four-party coalition in Cambodia.

	Qian Qichen pointed out that Vietnam has announced it will withdraw all its troops from Cambodia by the end of this September, and the international community demands that Vietnam implement this on schedule. Now, it is necessary to affirm this through an international agreement. He said that with the genuine withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Cambodia, foreign countries should gradually reduce and ultimately stop military aid, which includes all parties reducing and stopping military aid to the various Cambodian factions. Qian Qichen also briefed Siddhi on the recent Sino-Soviet foreign ministers' talks held in Beijing.

	Siddhi believed that the Sino-Soviet foreign ministers' talks achieved gratifying results. International public opinion responded positively. Regarding the issue of Vietnamese withdrawal, Siddhi said that the key is to have strict and effective international supervision. To this end, it is necessary to clarify how many troops Vietnam has in Cambodia and the specific steps for withdrawal; Vietnam should also provide relevant information.

	Qian Qichen expressed that China supports Thailand and other ASEAN countries in playing an important role in resolving the Cambodian issue.

　　中泰外长在京会谈    
    着重就政治解决柬埔寨问题深入交换意见
    新华社北京２月１０日电  （记者姜鲁榕）外交部长钱其琛和泰国外长西提·沙卫西拉在今天的会谈中一致认为，解决柬埔寨问题已进入关键阶段，有关各方加强协商、保持接触十分重要。钱其琛和西提在这里举行了三个半小时的会谈，着重就政治解决柬埔寨问题深入地交换了意见。会谈是在诚挚、友好的气氛中进行的。
    双方表示，中泰两国支持西哈努克亲王为实现柬埔寨四方联合所进行的各项活动。
    钱其琛指出，越南已宣布将在今年９月底前从柬埔寨全部撤军，国际社会要求越南如期实施，现在需要通过国际协议加以肯定。他说，随着越南从柬埔寨真正撤军，外国应逐步减少直至完全停止军援，这里包括各方都应减少直至停止对柬各派的军援。钱其琛还向西提通报了不久前在北京举行的中苏外长会谈情况。
    西提认为，中苏外长会谈取得了可喜成果。国际舆论对此反应良好。关于越南撤军问题，西提说，关键是要有严格、有效的国际监督。为此，需要弄清越南在柬埔寨有多少部队，具体撤军步骤；越南也应提供有关情况。
    钱其琛表示，中国支持泰国和其它东盟国家在解决柬埔寨问题方面发挥重要作用。
