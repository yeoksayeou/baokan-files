The Ministry of Commerce held a telephone conference this evening to confer the honorary title of "Grain Production and Procurement Advanced County" on 100 counties. Minister of Commerce Hu Ping expressed the hope that all regions would learn from these counties, vigorously support grain production, actively handle grain procurement work, ensure the completion of grain contract procurement tasks, and strive to procure more grain and secure more grain sources.

It is understood that these 100 counties account for only 5% of the total number of county-level administrative units and 9% of the total arable land in the country. However, in 1988, their total grain production accounted for 12% of the national total, and the completion of their contract procurement tasks accounted for 22.8% of the national procurement tasks.

　　百个粮食先进县受到商业部表彰
    本报北京２月２６日讯  记者潘岗报道：商业部今晚召开电话会议，授予１００个县“粮食生产、交售先进县”光荣称号。商业部长胡平希望各地向这些县学习，大力支持粮食生产，积极做好粮食收购工作，保证完成粮食合同定购任务，并力争多购一些粮食，多掌握一些粮源。
    据了解，这１００个县在全国县级行政单位总数和全国耕地面积中，分别只占５％、９％，但１９８８年粮食总产量却占全国粮食总产量的１２％，完成合同定购任务占全国定购任务的２２．８％。
