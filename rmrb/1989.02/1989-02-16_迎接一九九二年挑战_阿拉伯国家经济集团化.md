A new Arab economic group is set to emerge in the Middle East and North Africa. On the 14th, the prime ministers (premiers) of Egypt, Jordan, Iraq, and Yemen gathered in Amman, the capital of Jordan, to prepare for the establishment of the "Arab Cooperation Council."

Coincidentally, North Africa is also in the process of establishing the "Greater Maghreb" economic community, which is expected to announce the formation of a regional economic group consisting of Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, and Mauritania in the near future. Eight years ago, the Gulf Cooperation Council was established, with Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Bahrain, and Qatar joining hands to help stabilize world oil prices and promote economic development in the Gulf region. With this, the vast majority of Arab countries have been included in these three major economic groups. The situation is becoming clear: the Gulf Cooperation Council is in the east, characterized by abundant oil resources and strong financial power. The "Greater Maghreb" is in the west, with vast territories and close ties to Western Europe. The "Arab Cooperation Council" is in the middle, connecting both wings and having a greater capacity for integration.

On January 26, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak first revealed to the outside world that the four countries were preparing to establish a new Arab economic group. Government officials and economic experts from the four countries have reached preliminary agreements on the organizational form and basic framework, which will be finalized at the prime ministers' meeting. It is reported that the "Arab Cooperation Council" is an Arab economic cooperation organization that "does not target any country" and welcomes voluntary participation from member states of the Arab League. Its purpose is to gradually achieve economic integration among member states, especially in the fields of production and finance, ultimately leading to economic prosperity in each country. News from the Maghreb countries indicates that the "Greater Maghreb" will not only focus on economic cooperation but also include more advanced political coordination.

The four member countries of the "Arab Cooperation Council" that are about to be established have already established various bilateral cooperation committees and signed mutual benefit economic and trade agreements in their bilateral economic relations in recent years. In the initial stage of forming an economic group, they will first continue to implement bilateral agreements and then gradually expand bilateral relations to multilateral ones. The joint plans currently being considered by the organization are still in the initial stage, such as allowing the free flow of labor, capital, and some goods; expanding the types and amounts of mutual accounting trade; jointly establishing a joint-stock bank; simplifying or exempting personnel transit visas, etc. Near-term implementable projects include: connecting the power grids of Egypt and Jordan; helping Yemen build rural power grids with technology from Egypt, Jordan, and Iraq; establishing a microwave communication network for Egypt, Jordan, and Iraq, and connecting it with Europe; forming a joint transportation and shipping fleet for the four countries; investing in the construction of Yemen's oil pipeline project. Recently, economic circles in the four countries have generally believed that economic globalization is becoming an irreversible trend. The competition among the four major economic groups, namely the North American Free Trade Area, the European Community, the Asia-Pacific Economic Circle, and the CMEA of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, is intensifying. In particular, the emergence of the European Single Market in 1992 poses an unprecedented severe challenge to neighboring countries in the Middle East and North Africa. Arab countries "if they do not unite in time to form an internal cooperative group," will "basically be unable to communicate with the powerful Europe, and will suffer great losses in economic, trade, and debt negotiations." Some economic commentators bluntly point out that the "Arab Cooperation Council" and the "Greater Maghreb" are almost simultaneously established, which indeed has the practical need for the economic development of each country, but the more direct pressure is to face the challenge of the European Single Market established in 1992.

Egypt, Jordan, Iraq, and Yemen have a combined population of 80 million, with nearly 15 million labor force, and a combined GDP of nearly $100 billion. Together, they have a certain amount of strength. Geographically, Egypt, Jordan, and Iraq are in a straight line, and Egypt and Yemen are separated by water, making communication relatively easy. The economic structures of the four countries are more similar than different, and they have complementary advantages in labor, finance, and technology. Arab political figures also pointed out that Arab economic integration is not a repetition of the past political pan-Arab unity, but a lesson learned from the failures of the Egyptian-Syrian merger, the Moroccan-Libyan Federation, and the Iraqi-Syrian unity, focusing on economic cooperation and avoiding excessive political intervention. Their conclusion is: "The less political intervention and the more economic integration, the more stable the Arab economic group will be."

The simultaneous establishment of two new economic groups in the Arab world, and even the prediction of the emergence of an "Arab Common Market," is sufficient to prove the dramatic changes in the current world trend. Although the economic development of Arab countries lags behind that of Europe, they are also constantly adjusting to compete for a favorable position in the 21st century.

### 迎接一九九二年挑战——阿拉伯国家经济集团化

　　迎接一九九二年挑战
    ——阿拉伯国家经济集团化
    本报记者  林皎明
    西亚北非地区即将出现一个新的阿拉伯经济集团组织。埃及、约旦、伊拉克、阿拉伯也门４国总理（首相）１４日聚首约旦首都安曼，筹备成立“阿拉伯合作委员会”。
    无独有偶。北非目前也在筹备成立“大马格里布”经济共同体，预计不久即将宣布成立由摩洛哥、阿尔及利亚、突尼斯、利比亚和毛里塔尼亚５国组成的区域性经济集团组织。８年前，海湾合作委员会成立，沙特阿拉伯、科威特、阿联酋、阿曼、巴林和卡塔尔携起手来，互助互惠，在稳定世界原油价格、增进海湾地区经济发展等方面颇有建树。至此，阿拉伯世界的绝大多数国家被囊括进这３大经济集团中来。态势逐渐明朗：海湾合作委员会在东，以原油丰富和财力雄厚为特点。“大马格里布”在西，幅员广阔，紧连西欧。“阿拉伯合作委员会”居中，侧应两翼，拥有更大的兼容余地。
    埃及总统穆巴拉克１月２６日首次向外界透露４国正在筹组新阿拉伯经济集团的消息。４国政府官员和经济专家就其组织形式和基本框架达成初步意见，交总理级会议定案。据透露，“阿拉伯合作委员会”是阿拉伯经济合作联合组织，“不针对任何国家”，欢迎阿盟成员国自愿参加。其宗旨是通过成员国逐渐走向经济一体化，尤其在生产和金融领域紧密合作，最终实现各国经济繁荣。来自马格里布国家的消息说，“大马格里布”除以经济合作为主外，还有政治协调等更进一步的联合内容。
    即将成立的“阿拉伯合作委员会”的４个成员国，在近年的双边经济关系中早已成立多种双边合作委员会，签署过互惠经贸协定。结成经济集团初期，首先是继续执行双边协议，然后逐渐将双边关系扩大到多边。该组织目前考虑制定的联合计划，仍属于初级阶段，诸如允许劳工、资金、及部分商品自由流通；扩大相互记帐贸易的种类和金额；集资办合股银行；简化或免除人员过境签证，等等。近期可以实施的项目包括：埃约两国电网连通；埃、约、伊３国从技术上帮助阿拉伯也门架设农村电网；建立埃、约、伊３国微波通讯网，并与欧洲并网；组建４国交通联运和联合船队；投资建设阿拉伯也门石油输管工程。近来，４国经济界人士纷纷认为，世界经济集团化正在成为不可逆转的发展趋势。北美自由贸易区、欧洲共同体、亚太经济圈和苏联东欧经互会等４大集团竞争日趋激烈。尤其是，１９９２年欧洲统一大市场的出现，是对西亚、北非邻近国家“一次前所未有的严峻挑战”。阿拉伯国家“如若不及时联合成内部协作互惠的集团”，“将根本无法与强大的欧洲交流，在经济、贸易以及债务谈判中要吃大亏”。有的经济评论直言不讳地指出，“阿拉伯合作委员会”和“大马格里布”几乎同时成立，诚然有各国经济发展的现实需要，但更为直接的压力是面对１９９２年成立的欧洲统一大市场的挑战。
    埃及、约旦、伊拉克、阿拉伯也门４国拥有８０００万人口，劳动力近１５００万，年国民生产总值近１０００亿美元，联合起来具有一定的实力。从地理上看，埃、约、伊３国一字排开，埃及同阿拉伯也门一水相隔，联系不算困难。４国经济结构同大于异，在劳力、金融、技术等方面具有互补性。阿拉伯政界人士还指出，阿拉伯经济集团化并不是以往政治性泛阿拉伯统一的重复，而是接受埃叙合并、摩（洛哥）利（比亚）联邦和伊叙统一失败的教训，着眼于经济合作，避免政治的相互过多干预。他们的结论是：“越少的政治介入与越多的经济联合实惠，才是阿拉伯经济集团组织稳定的基础。”
    阿拉伯世界几乎同时成立两大新的经济集团，甚至有人更进一步预测出现“阿拉伯共同市场”，足以证明当今世界潮流的剧变。阿拉伯各国经济发展相比之下落后于欧洲，但它们也在不断调整，为２１世纪的发展争取有利地位。
