Vice Premier Tian Jiyun today said that while accelerating the development of its own economy, China is willing to make every effort to promote the economic prosperity of the Pacific region through various mutually beneficial cooperation channels.

Tian Jiyun delivered his speech via satellite television from the Great Hall of the People this morning at the invitation of the 1989 Pacific Economic Conference held in Hong Kong.

He said that in recent years, the economy of this region has developed rapidly, and the Pacific region has become one of the most dynamic areas of economic growth recognized worldwide. Its economic activities have become an important factor influencing the global economic situation. However, there are also countries and regions within this region with different levels of development, different social systems, and different cultural traditions. Only through mutual respect and equal, mutually beneficial cooperation can all countries and regions fully play to their own strengths and advantages, and truly achieve lasting prosperity in the Pacific region on the basis of common development.

Tian Jiyun said that as the most populous developing country in the Pacific region, China's economic development has special significance for the economic prosperity of the Pacific region. After the speech, Tian Jiyun answered questions from the conference chairman, Lee Kwok-pui, chairman of the East Asia Bank in Hong Kong.

The conference was organized by the Western Australian Development Corporation. More than 500 representatives attended the meeting.

    中国愿为太平洋地区经济繁荣努力
    据新华社北京２月２１日电  田纪云副总理今天在这里说，中国愿在加速本国经济发展的同时，通过各种互利的合作途径，为促进太平洋地区的经济繁荣尽最大努力。
    田纪云今天上午应邀在人民大会堂通过电视卫星向在香港召开的“１９８９年太平洋经济研讨会”发表讲话。

    田纪云说，作为太平洋地区人口最多的发展中国家，中国的经济发展对太平洋区域的经济繁荣具有特殊的重要意义。讲话后，田纪云回答了大会执行主席、香港东亚银行董事长李国宝的提问。
