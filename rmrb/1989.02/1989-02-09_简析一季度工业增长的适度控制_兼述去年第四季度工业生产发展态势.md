The sustained high-speed growth of industrial production has been one of the prominent features of the overheating economy in recent years. Since September 1988, when the central government and the State Council implemented economic tightening policies, the trend of industrial production has changed. To continue the macro-control of industrial production, the growth rate of industrial production in the first quarter of this year should be around 15% to 16%.

I. Closing the Tap of Funds Supply, Industrial Growth Decreases Monthly

One of the main reasons for the long-term high growth rate of industrial production is credit expansion, which has provided excessive funds for industrial development. From January to August 1988, the average monthly year-on-year growth rate of China's total industrial output value was 1.49%, while the average monthly growth of all bank loans during the same period was 2.36%, and the average monthly growth of industrial working capital loans was 2.6%.

Starting in September 1988, the money supply was tightened. This control of the credit scale was not just to control the end-of-month balance for a single month, but to control the credit scale for four consecutive months. From September to December 1988, the average monthly decrease in the balance of all bank loans was 0.7%, and the average monthly decrease in industrial working capital loans was 0.71%.

Although the impact of the loan scale on industrial production has a certain lag, industrial production in the fourth quarter of 1988 had already begun to break away from the accelerating trend of each quarter, growing by only 3.86% compared to the previous quarter, making it the slowest-growing quarter of the year.

II. After the Rush to Buy, Savings Begin to Rise, Market Demand for Industrial Products is Controlled to Some Extent

Another important source of industrial overgrowth is the long-term excess of total social demand over total supply. From January to August 1988, the average monthly growth of market currency circulation was 4.19%, wages and personal expenditures averaged a monthly growth of 2.87%, and the average monthly growth of bank savings cash expenditures reached 8.49%. Under the stimulus of demand growth higher than production, the average monthly growth of social commodity retail sales was 3.78%, and there were two significant price hikes and buying sprees within the year.

Starting in September, the State Council implemented a series of measures, including "value-preserving savings," controlling the issuance of currency, controlling the purchasing power of social groups, and controlling the scale of fixed asset investments. Excessive demand began to be initially controlled. From September to December 1988, urban savings deposits began to rise, with an average monthly increase of 2.7%, significantly higher than the average monthly increase of 1.8% in the previous eight months; during the same period, the growth of market currency circulation began to slow down, with an average monthly growth of only 1.42%, and wage expenditures averaged a monthly decrease of 1.61%. Commercial working capital loans also decreased from an average monthly increase of 2.08% in the first eight months to an average monthly decrease of 0.22% in the last four months. The decline in all these industrial product demand items resulted in a 1.5% seasonal adjustment decrease in the fourth quarter's social commodity retail sales compared to the previous quarter, which was the second such occurrence in the 1980s. This significantly eased the market's pull on industrial production.

III. After Rectification and Reform, the Proportion of Light and Heavy Industries Has Been Coordinated to Some Extent. Coal, Oil, and Steel in Heavy Industry Have Grown Rapidly, but Power Remains Tight

The internal proportion of light and heavy industries. In the first three quarters of 1988, due to the impact of demand expansion, the growth rate of light industry was consistently higher than that of heavy industry. In the fourth quarter, the actual growth and year-on-year growth rate of light industry production were both higher than those of heavy industry production. However, the seasonal factors of light industry production in the fourth quarter were about five percentage points higher than those of heavy industry production. After excluding seasonal factors, light industry production in the fourth quarter grew by only 2.1% compared to the previous quarter, while heavy industry production grew by 5.0%. Due to the longer production cycle of heavy industry products and the longer inventory cycle of raw materials, the immediate impact of tightening the money supply on light industry production can be seen, while the impact on heavy industry production will be delayed for a period before it becomes apparent.

In the fourth quarter of last year, China's basic industries such as raw coal, crude oil, and steel grew faster than the previous quarter, which is a welcome phenomenon. However, it is noteworthy that the electricity generation in the fourth quarter did not grow much compared to the previous quarter.

The growth pattern of state-owned and collective industries also changed in the fourth quarter of last year. In the first three quarters of 1988, the growth of collective industry was much faster than that of state-owned industry, but in the fourth quarter after tightening, the growth rate of collective industry was lower than that of the previous quarter, while the growth rate of state-owned industry was higher than that of the previous quarter, and the gap between the two narrowed to 0.9%. The reversal of the growth pattern of the two indicates that collective industrial enterprises are more dependent on loans and market demand for consumer goods compared to state-owned industrial enterprises.

IV. The Industrial Growth Rate in the First Quarter of This Year Should Be Around 16%, Laying the Foundation for Controlling the Annual Growth Rate

The results of cluster analysis of China's industrial development speeds in different periods using four industrial enterprise economic benefit indicators such as fund-output ratio, cost-profit ratio, inventory-sales ratio, and finished product fund ratio indicate that under the current level of science and technology and management in China, the annual growth rate of industrial production should be maintained at 10%-12%. If China's industrial production in 1989 can maintain this development speed, the phenomenon of economic overheating can be cooled down, and the national industrial production plan can also be overfulfilled.

Based on the seasonal characteristics of China's industrial production and the growth distribution of each quarter last year, the above annual growth control target can be decomposed into quarterly control speeds. Compared with the same period last year, the industrial production control speed in the first quarter is 15.5%-16.3%, the second quarter is 11.5%-13.1%, the third quarter is 8.4%-10.7%, and the fourth quarter is 5.8%-8.8%.

It can be seen that China's industrial production should implement a gradual braking strategy, aiming to reduce the industrial production in the first quarter by 3 to 4 percentage points compared to the fourth quarter of last year, and then gradually reduce it by about 3 percentage points each quarter. As long as the industrial growth rate of each quarter this year is roughly close to the above numbers, the annual industrial growth rate can be controlled within a reasonable range.

The above control figures can be used as guiding control targets. They can be used to assess the appropriateness of China's current tightening policies. If the industrial growth in the first quarter still exceeds 18%, then the tightening measures in the subsequent quarters should be further strengthened. Conversely, if the growth in the first quarter is below 13%, it indicates that the tightening policy is slightly excessive, and it can be appropriately relaxed in the subsequent quarters.

Since the control of the industrial growth rate requires a gradual decrease each quarter, the difficulty of control in the next few quarters will gradually increase. Therefore, all macroeconomic management departments should increase their regulatory awareness and should not easily relax their work based on the achievements of the previous quarter.

The main economic measures for the macro-control of industrial production are to control the credit scale and reduce excessive market demand.

In terms of controlling the credit scale, first, it is necessary to strengthen the unified management of the credit scale of private financial organizations, thereby achieving planned control of the overall credit scale of society; second, it is necessary to improve the current credit scale assessment methods, shifting from the assessment of end-of-month balances to the assessment of average monthly balances, thereby effectively controlling the credit scale.

In terms of continuing to control market demand, first, it is necessary to continue to stabilize and increase residents' savings deposits, thereby temporarily reducing the current market pressure; second, it is necessary to firmly implement policies to rectify the economic environment, rectify economic order, and curb inflation, firmly reduce the scale of fixed asset investments throughout society, and stop the rapid growth of consumption funds. Currently, people's psychological expectations of future price increases have decreased compared to July and August of last year, but people's psychological expectations of prices are not stable. Once market management is relaxed and the implementation of tightening policies is relaxed, the buying spree may reappear, and industrial production may again experience high-speed growth, and the previous tightening achievements will be in vain.

　　简析一季度工业增长的适度控制
　　——兼述去年第四季度工业生产发展态势
　　国家信息中心经济预测部
    工业生产持续超高速增长，是近年来经济发展过热的突出表现之一。自１９８８年９月份中央和国务院采取经济紧缩政策以来，工业生产趋势发生了变化，为继续实施对工业生产的宏观控制，今年第一季度工业增长速度应以１５％至１６％左右为宜。
    一、关小资金供应的“水龙头”，工业生产增长逐月下降
    工业增长速度长期居高不下的重要原因之一是信贷膨胀，它给工业生产发展提供了过量的资金供应。１９８８年１—８月份，我国工业总产值平均月环比增长速度为１．４９％，而同期银行各项贷款合计平均月增长２．３６％，工业流动资金贷款月平均增长２．６％。
    １９８８年９月开始收紧银根。这次控制信贷规模不是单纯控制某一月份期末余额，而是连续四个月控制贷款规模。１９８８年９—１２月，银行各项贷款余额平均每月递减０．７％，工业流动资金贷款平均月递减０．７１％。
    尽管贷款规模对工业生产的影响有一定的时滞，１９８８年第四季度工业生产仍已开始摆脱逐季加速的状态，只比上季增长３．８６％，成为全年增长最慢的一个季度。
    二、抢购风刮过后，储蓄开始回升，市场对工业品的需求得到一定控制
    工业超速增长的另一个重要根源是社会总需求长期大于总供给。１９８８年１—８月份，市场货币流通量平均月增长４．１９％，工资及对个人支出平均月增长２．８７％，银行储蓄现金支出平均月增长高达８．４９％。在高于生产增长的需求刺激下，社会商品零售额平均月增长３．７８％，１９８８年内已先后出现两次较大的涨价和抢购高峰。
    自９月份开始，国务院先后实行了“保值储蓄”、控制货币发行量、控制社会集团购买力，控制固定资产投资规模等一系列措施，过旺的需求开始得到初步控制。１９８８年９—１２月，城镇储蓄存款开始回升，平均月递增２．７％，明显高于前八个月平均月递增１．８％的速度；同期市场货币流通量的增长开始趋缓，平均月增长仅为１．４２％，工资性支出平均月递减１．６１％，商业流动资金贷款也由１—８月的月平均递增２．０８％下降到９—１２月的月平均递减０．２２％。所有这些工业品需求项目的下降，致使１９８８年第四季度社会商品零售额季节调整数比上季下降１．５％，这是８０年代以来各季中仅有的第二次。它有力地缓解了市场对工业生产的拉力。
    三、治理整顿后，轻重工业比例有所协调。重工业中原煤、石油、钢铁增长较快，但电力仍然紧张
    工业内部的轻重工业比例关系。１９８８年前三个季度，由于需求膨胀的影响，轻工业增长速度一直高于重工业。第四季度，轻工业生产增长的实际数和与去年同期相比的速度均大于重工业生产。但是，第四季度轻工业生产的季节因素比重工业生产约大五个百分点。扣除季节因素后，第四季度轻工业生产仅比上季增长２．１％，而重工业却增长５．０％。由于重工业产品生产周期较长，原材料库存周期也较长，所以，紧缩银根立即可见对轻工业生产的影响，而对重工业生产的影响要滞后一段时期才能显现。
    去年四季度，我国原煤、原油、钢材等基础工业比上季增长较快，是一个可喜的现象，但值得注意的是，第四季度发电量比上季增长不多。
    去年四季度，全民与集体工业的增长格局也发生了变化。１９８８年前３个季度，集体工业增长远快于全民所有制工业的增长，而紧缩后的第四季度，集体工业增长速度低于上季，全民工业增长速度高于上季，两者差距缩小到０．９％。两者增长格局的逆转说明，集体工业企业与全民工业企业相比，对贷款和消费品市场需求的依赖性更大。
    四、今年第一季度工业增长速度应在１６％左右，为控制全年增长幅度奠定基础
    使用资金产值率、成本利税率、销存比和产成品资金比例等４项工业企业经济效益指标对我国各个不同时期工业发展速度进行聚类分析的结果表明，在目前我国科技水平和管理水平下，我国工业生产年增长率宜保持在１０％—１２％。如果１９８９年我国工业生产能维持这一发展速度，经济过热现象可得以降温，同时，国家工业生产计划亦可超额完成。
    根据我国工业生产的季节特征和去年各季的增长分布，可以把上述年增长控制目标分解为季控制速度。与去年同期相比，第一季度工业生产控制速度为１５．５％—１６．３％，第二季度为１１．５％—１３．１％，第三季度为８．４％—１０．７％，第四季度为５．８％—８．８％。
    由此可见，我国工业生产应实施缓刹车，争取第一季度工业生产比去年第四季度下降３至４个百分点，以后逐季下降３个百分点左右。只要今年各季工业增长速度大体接近上述所列数字，则全年工业增长速度可控制在适度范围。
    上述控制数字可以作为指导性控制目标。它可用来考核我国正实施的紧缩政策的适度情况。如果第一季度工业增长仍超过１８％，则以后各季更应强化紧缩措施，相反，如果第一季度的增长低于１３％，则说明紧缩政策稍有过分，在以后各季内还可适当放松。
    由于控制工业增长速度要逐季递减，今后几个季度的控制难度将逐渐加大，因此，各宏观经济管理部门应增加调控意识，切不可轻易在前季已取得的成果基础上，放松工作。
    工业生产宏观控制的主要经济措施，是控制信贷规模，缩小过大的市场需求。
    就控制信贷规模来讲，一是要加强对民间金融组织信用规模的统一管理，从而实现有计划地控制全社会的信用规模；二是要改进考核信贷规模的现行办法，从月末余额的考核转变到月平均余额的考核，从而有效地控制信贷规模。
    就继续控制市场需求来讲，一是要继续稳定和增加居民储蓄存款，从而暂时缩小当期市场的压力；二是要坚决贯彻治理经济环境，整顿经济秩序，抑制通货膨胀的各项政策，坚决压缩全社会固定资产投资规模，制止消费基金的过快增长。目前，人们对未来物价上涨的心理预期比去年７、８月份有所下降，但人们对物价的心理预期并不稳定，一旦放松市场管理，放松紧缩政策的贯彻，抢购风就可能重现，工业生产也会再出现高速度，前一段的紧缩成就也将功亏一篑。
