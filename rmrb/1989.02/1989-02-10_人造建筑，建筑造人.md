Churchill once said: “People build architecture, and architecture shapes people!” Most of one's life is spent within buildings, which define people's behavioral patterns and shape the personality of each generation, forming the cultural psychology of a nation.

The basic unit of traditional Chinese architecture, the courtyard house, has made an immortal contribution to the formation of Chinese cultural patterns. The layout, with walls tightly enclosing the courtyard, has a strong inward, cohesive quality. The south-north axis and east-west symmetry, centered on the patriarchal clan and bloodline ethics, reflect the feudal hierarchical system; the strict separation of men and women is like a series of barriers, with strict prohibitions. The feudal kingdom is essentially a large patriarchal family, hence the saying, “The emperor regards the four seas as his home,” and the architecture of the palace and the home has a holistic significance. The walls of the courtyard house are a miniature of the Forbidden City, or one could say the Forbidden City is an enlarged courtyard house. Even today, walking beneath the walls of the imperial palace, one can still feel the awe-inspiring power of “not seeing the grandeur of the imperial residence, how can one know the majesty of the emperor.” Furthermore, the Great Wall is merely the outer wall of the entire country, which is why the English call the Great Wall the “Great Wall.” We truly are a nation of walls, a people of walls, and thus have a culture of walls. The strength and length of the walls are outstanding features, but they also have a major characteristic of being closed off internally and closed off from the outside world. This tradition became increasingly entrenched by the late Qing Dynasty. Even today, our large and small institutions are all called “courtyards,” and the crisscrossing walls form a city network, restricting people's vision and actions. No wonder Chinese architecture and Chinese culture, from Hemudu and Banpo Village, have remained unchanged for six or seven thousand years, passed down from generation to generation, becoming one of the national treasures that the Chinese people are proud of.

Compared to Western brick and stone architecture, Chinese architecture also has its own unique features worth being proud of in terms of materials and structure. Although wooden frameworks consume a lot of timber, causing ecological problems like “the construction of the Alang Palace left the mountains of Shu bare,” they are advantageous in earthquakes as the walls can fall but the house remains standing; this shows that we are smarter than foreigners. This super-stable, static building structure is similar to the super-stable, static social structure that has lasted for thousands of years; the feudal dynasty may fall, but its deeply rooted cultural influence remains, just like a house that collapses but the structure does not fall. The large roofs of Chinese architecture have beautiful skylines, which are highly regarded by some connoisseurs of antiquity as national treasures, and they unconsciously put some glazed tile hats on new concrete, steel, and glass buildings to embody the excellent national traditions that have lasted for generations.

Personal humility and national arrogance are sometimes opposites. On one hand, some of us have a strong sense of inferiority, feeling that we are inferior in every way; on the other hand, when foreigners praise us, some of us can't help but feel elated. It is said that astronauts in space can see the man-made structures on Earth, and only the Great Wall and the Grand Canal are the most prominent, which satisfies the national vanity of many people. However, the development of inland canals actually contrasts with the desolation of maritime activities. Due to the lack of the maritime spirit of exploration that Westerners have, the great feat of Zheng He's voyages could only be a fleeting moment, leaving later generations to regret it. It is like the Four Great Inventions, which bloomed within the walls but were enjoyed outside, so that “bees and butterflies flutter over the wall, suspecting that the spring color is in the neighbor's house.”

Mythical history tells us that whether it was Yan, Huang, or Chi You, they were all heroes who dared not to follow their ancestors' footsteps. Unfortunately, the descendants shout “descendants of Yan and Huang” so loudly every day, but those who truly carry on their pioneering and innovative spirit are few. Since ancient times, sages have been lonely, and the reformer Wang Anshi of the Middle Ages shouted, “The ancestors are not to be followed!” but ended up in a tragic situation. Today, we are in an era of reform and opening up. What we need is new architecture that is in tune with the times, and this new architecture will create an environment conducive to the formation of new lifestyles and new values.

### 人造建筑，建筑造人

　　人造建筑，建筑造人
　　艾定增
    丘吉尔说过：“人造建筑，建筑造人！”人生大部分时间在建筑中度过，建筑限定人的生活行为方式，造就一代一代人的个性，形成民族文化心理特征。
    中国古建筑的基本细胞四合院对于中国文化模式的形成作出了不朽的贡献。四周封得严严实实，密不透风的墙环绕庭院的布局，具有强烈的向心内聚性。以小农宗法血缘伦理为核心的南北轴线东西对称格局反映了封建等级制度；男女大防更是步步壁垒，禁区森严。封建王国实质上是宗法大家庭，故有“天子以四海为家”之说，而宫廷和家宅建筑也具有全息相称的意义。四合院墙是紫禁宫城的缩影，或者说紫禁宫城是四合院的放大。至今在故宫皇城下走过，仍然可以感到当年“不睹皇居壮，安知天子尊”的威严力量。进而言之，万里长城不过是整个国家的院墙而已，难怪英语称长城为“大墙”。我们真不愧为一个墙的国家，墙的民族，因而有墙的文化。墙的坚固、绵长等自是突出的优点，但又有一个最大特点是对内封闭禁锢，对外闭关锁国。这传统到了晚清就一发变得积重难返了。直到今天，我们的大小机关毫无例外地称为某某大院，纵横交错的围墙织成一个城市网络，限定人们的视野和行动。难怪中国建筑和中国文化一样，从河姆渡、半坡村开始，六七千年一贯制，薪火相传，成了国人引以自豪的传家宝之一。
    和西方砖石建筑相比，中国建筑在材料、结构上也有自己值得自豪的特色。木构架虽然耗费木材，造成“阿房出，蜀山兀”的生态环境问题，但墙倒屋不塌，对付地震却很有利；这，可见我们比外国人聪明。这种超稳定、静态的建筑结构和几千年超稳定、静态的社会结构颇有异曲同工之妙；封建王朝倒了，而其根深柢固的文化影响至今仍有房倒屋不塌之势。中国建筑的大屋顶具有优美的天际曲线，就很令一些嗜古成癖的高人雅士尊为国宝，情不自禁地在钢筋水泥玻璃的新建筑上戴一些琉璃瓦帽子，以体现优秀民族传统源远流长。
    个人的谦虚和民族的自大有时是相反相成的。一方面，我们有些人有很强的自卑感，觉得处处不如人；一方面一听到外国人吹捧，一些人就难免飘飘然起来。据说宇航员在太空中看地球上的人工建筑物，只有万里长城和京杭大运河最为明显，这又投合了不少人的民族虚荣心。殊不知内陆运河的发达，正好反衬出海上活动的寂寥。由于缺乏西方人那种海洋开拓的精神，至使郑和远航的壮举只能昙花一现，留给后人惋惜。它和四大发明一样墙里开花墙外香，以至“蜂蝶纷纷过墙去，却疑春色在邻家”。
    神话历史告诉我们，无论炎、黄或蚩尤，他们都是不屑于对祖宗亦步亦趋的勇士。可惜后辈天天把炎黄子孙喊得震天响，真正把他们开拓创新的精神发扬的并不多。自古圣贤多寂寞，中世纪的改革家王安石大声疾呼过“祖宗不足法”！只落得一个悲惨下场。今天，我们正处在改革开放时代，我们需要的是与时代合拍的新建筑，这种新建筑将造成一个有利于新的生活方式和新的价值观念形成的环境。
