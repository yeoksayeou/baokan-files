A joint essay contest on "Hot Topics Among Youth" sponsored by the Communist Youth League Central Committee, Huabei Pharmaceutical Factory, and our newspaper is now open for submissions. We eagerly hope to receive support from a broad readership, especially from young people, youth workers, and youth theorists. We welcome everyone to submit their works.

Please send your submissions to the Political and Legal Affairs Department of the People's Daily in Beijing, and be sure to mark them "Essay Contest on Hot Topics Among Youth."

"Goldang" (金刚), according to traditional Chinese culture, refers to someone with supernatural powers.

The "Transformers" of today are products of American toy manufacturers. They produce toys and also create an animated series to advertise them, dividing the toy characters into good and evil factions and depicting them in a fairy tale battle. This combination of fantasy, science fiction, and simple morality captivates young children, making them insist on buying a "Transformer" toy. Free screenings of "Transformers" have created a favorable environment for selling these toys. In a short time, "Transformers" have flooded the Chinese toy market, with prices that are shockingly high. The lowest price I saw in Beijing and Shanghai was 18 or 24 yuan, and these are only mid-to-low-end imported items. High-end "Transformer" toys can cost up to a thousand yuan. As for books printed from the animated series, the prices are also astonishing, with a thin book costing around 0.8 yuan, and there are multiple editions, with new ones being published. Despite this, "Transformers" are still in short supply. Parents can't resist their children's demands and eventually give in.

The "Transformers" change form, and the money from the pockets of ordinary people ends up in the hands of toy distributors. Chinese foreign exchange, which is so hard to earn, ends up in someone else's pocket.

Everyone knows that China's foreign exchange is tight, yet we import such a large quantity of high-end toys. Do we still have the surplus foreign exchange for this? Can't we even make our own toys?

From "Transformers," I think back to the Opium War of old. "Transformers" and opium are different; they have no harmful effects and are not spread by force. However, they do have one similarity: opium exchanged Chinese silver for foreign goods, and "Transformers" have caused China to lose so much hard-earned foreign exchange. Although they cannot be compared, I vaguely feel that this seems to be a "Transformers" war that is quietly unfolding.

In an open environment, people pay too much attention to guarding against different ideologies but pay little attention to those cultural products without political factors and harmless content, lacking the corresponding awareness, and even actively introducing them, thus making some simple and common mistakes. The "Transformers" issue is like this, and other similar "wars" are also unfolding. Completely rejecting foreign goods is not right, nor is it effective, but rejecting some goods that are harmless but not urgently needed (whether they are cultural or other goods) is necessary in our current economic situation.

This "Transformers" war has cost us dearly. The responsibility lies with the people, the relevant state departments, or certain individuals? Or, more abstractly, should it be traced to the system? Should it be traced to the cultural model? Perhaps everyone is to blame. The law does not blame the crowd, and the matter has already passed, but I think we should seriously summarize the experience to avoid such "Transformers" wars in the future.

### 少一些“金刚战”吧！

　　少一些“金刚战”吧！
    松海
    由共青团中央、华北制药厂与本报联合举办的《青年热门话题》有奖征文，今天与大家见面了，我们热切希望得到广大读者特别是广大青年、青年工作者、青年理论工作者的支持，欢迎大家踊跃赐稿。

    “金刚”，据我国传统文化的解释，是具有某种神通者也。
    今日所见“变形金刚”为美国的玩具商制造与经销。他们制造玩具，又专拍一部动画连续片做广告，将玩具人物分善恶两派以童话的方式开战，集魔幻性、科幻性、简单伦常于一炉，使少年儿童看后如痴如醉，非缠着家长去买一个“金刚”玩具不可。免费播映《变形金刚》，创造了销售这种玩具的有利环境。一时间，“变形金刚”泛滥于中国的玩具市场，价格昂贵令人咋舌。仅作者在北京、上海所见，最低标价１８元或２４元，据说这只是进口了中低档品种。高档的“金刚”玩具一套高达千元。至于由动画片印制的图书，价格也惊人，薄薄一册要０．８元左右，版本尚有数种，更有新编问世。虽如此，“变形金刚”还是脱销。家长拗不过孩子们，终于慷慨解囊了。
    “金刚”神通，变来变去，老百姓口袋里的钱变到了玩具经销者手里，中国人的外汇变到了人家的口袋里。
    我国外汇吃紧，众所周知，却如此大量进口这种高级的玩具，难道我们的外汇还有这个遗力？难道我们自己连个玩具也制造不了？
    从“变形金刚”，我想到当年的“鸦片战争”。“金刚”与“鸦片”不同，它没有毒害性，更没有以炮火为媒介。不过两者也有一点相似，“鸦片”从中国换走了白银，“金刚”使中国流失了那么不容易得来的外汇。两者虽然不能相提并论，我却隐隐约约感到这似乎是一场正在悄悄打响的“金刚战”。
    在开放的环境中，人们过多注意对不同意识形态的防范，却很少把那些无政治因素、内容无害的文化产品作为商品看待，缺少相应的意识，甚至主动引进，从而犯了些简单常识性的错误。“变形金刚”问题如此，其它类似的“战争”也展开着。一概抵制外货不对，也无效，但抵制一些虽然无害但不是急需的商品（不管那是文化的还是其它的商品），在我们现在的经济形势下，并不是没有必要的。
    这场“金刚战”使我们损失了许多。责任在老百姓，在国家有关部门，还是某些有关的人？或者抽象一点，该追到体制？该追到文化模式？恐怕都有责任。法不责众，事也已过，我倒是以为应该认真总结，以求少发生这样的“金刚战”。
