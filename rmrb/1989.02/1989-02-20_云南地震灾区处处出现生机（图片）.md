In the three months since the earthquake, the people of various ethnic groups in the severely affected counties of Láncāng, Gěngmǎ, and Cāngyuán in Yunnan have been rebuilding their homes and restoring normal production and life. The disaster areas are now full of vitality.

The primary and secondary schools in Yáoshī Town, Cāngyuán Wa Autonomous County, Yunnan, collapsed in the earthquake. The town has since built temporary classrooms for the schools, and now, students are back in class.

In Láncāng Lǎhù Autonomous County, Yunnan, a woman from the Lǎhù ethnic group gave birth to a baby during the earthquake and named the child Zhèngshēng. Both mother and child are now healthy.
