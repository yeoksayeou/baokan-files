Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Kiyu speaks, defends Kakuji's remarks

    People's Daily, Tokyo, February 20th: Correspondent Yu Qing reports: Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Kiyu said in today's press conference regarding Prime Minister Kakuji's response in the Diet about the aggression war, "Prime Minister Kakuji has no intention of changing the past line. His response is consistent with the past government's response. If there is any misunderstanding, we deeply regret it."

    Following this, Kiyu, on behalf of the government, reiterated Japan's stance on the Second World War: First, it is a fact that Japan caused significant losses to the people of neighboring countries during the past war; second, it is necessary to fully recognize that Japan's actions during the war are considered aggression and have been severely criticized internationally; third, Japan believes that such events should not be repeated, and as a peaceful country, it will contribute to world peace and stability.

    Local public opinion believes that Kiyu's explanation is due to the strong reaction Kakuji's response has recently sparked overseas.

　　日官房长官发表谈话  为竹下讲话巧言辩解
    本报东京２月２０日电  记者于青报道：日本官房长官小渊在今天的记者会见中，就竹下首相在国会关于侵略战争的答辩进行解释说：“竹下首相并无意改变过去的路线。其答辩与过去政府的答辩没有丝毫变化。如果有误解，实感遗憾。”
    接着，小渊代表政府再次表明对第二次世界大战的态度：一、日本在过去战争中，给近邻诸国的国民造成重大损失是事实；二、有必要充分认识到，对于我国在战争中的行为，国际上认为是侵略并受到严厉地批判这一事实；三、日本认为，这样的事情不能重演，作为和平国家，要为世界和平和稳定做出贡献。
    此间舆论认为，小渊进行解释，是因为竹下的答辩近日在海外引起强烈的反应。
