Title: The Story of the Big Cabinet

Our dormitory has a big cabinet, newly made but not yet painted.

There is a narrow corridor next to the female soldiers' dormitory. My room is at the corner, and at the other end is the hospital's paint shop. The painter is an old man. In the narrow corridor that only allows one person to pass, he always gives way to us—leaning against the wall, his white hair brushing the wall, as if still nodding in apology. The female soldiers are probably used to being given way to from a young age and do not mind. Perhaps they think we are the rightful owners, while he is just a laborer. I, however, feel uneasy about his white hair brushing the wall and always give way first. He must be over 60 years old.

At first, he would still greet me and give way politely, but later he would just smile and hurry past. After that, he dared to greet me—going to work, resting, going to the market? I felt uneasy again, but even though I am not good at small talk, I would still greet him first—going to work, resting, eating? He was so happy, and even after walking far away, I could still hear him chuckling with delight.

He loves watching movies and often asks me, “Aren’t you going to the club to watch a movie?” He calls television movies as well. In the TV room, he opens his mouth wide, stretches his neck, and every white hair on his head is so focused.

Once, when a movie was being shown in the auditorium, he was stopped. I helped him get in. Later, I often gave him tickets, and his chuckling laughter was filled with more gratitude.

In the summer, movies were shown in the courtyard. He stood far away at the back of the crowd, mouth open, neck stretched, every white hair on his head so focused… I told him I had two bamboo chairs and could lend him one.

Every time he returned the chair, he would say at least four “thank yous.” Perhaps it was after seeing the unpainted big cabinet that he changed to saying two. And whenever he met me, he seemed to be waiting for me to say something.

Finally, one day, he returned the chair but didn’t leave. He said he wanted to help me paint the big cabinet. I was startled and said no need. He didn’t leave, saying he wouldn’t take money and would just sleep less. I explained again and again, and he left reluctantly. After that, his chuckling laughter was mixed with unease.

Soon, he mysteriously told me that he could come to my room to paint, and no one would know. I laughed and had to explain again… After that, he no longer awkwardly called me comrade but changed to the more familiar “girl.” “Girl, do you miss home being alone here?” “I’m used to it, master.” “Are you scared, still keeping the light on so late?” “No, master, I’m reading.” “Oh! No wonder, you’re different from others, you’re educated and polite!” I was startled. No one had ever complimented me, someone who didn’t even finish middle school.

One day, after I finished my night shift and was sleeping, someone lightly knocked on the door. I didn’t want to get up—who is it? I heard a familiar cough, and it was the old painter! He was dressed neatly, not a spot of paint on him, and his white hair was combed. “Girl, my work is done, and I’m leaving. You’ve been so good to me, and if you ever need me…” He said, glancing at the big cabinet. I subconsciously took his address, wanting to say he hadn’t bothered me, and I hadn’t done much for him. I wouldn’t need him to paint my furniture in the future. But I couldn’t say anything, feeling very sad, as if I had lost something precious.

The next year, the hospital hired another old painter. He didn’t like watching movies and didn’t like greeting people. But when he met someone, he would still lean against the wall to give way. I would also give way first, but I didn’t plan to talk to him again.

Once, I saw him drinking water from the tap, and from a hygiene perspective, I had to intervene. He was startled at first, but when he understood that I was doing it for his sake, he said, “I’m used to it, used to it.” “The boiler room has hot water.” “It’s too far, it’s trouble.” “You can come to my place to get it, it’s not far.” At least I said this three times before he actually came to get it, every time looking very awkward, as if I was giving him ginseng soup. Until one day he saw the unpainted big cabinet, he became more at ease. I couldn’t help but feel a pang in my heart, hurriedly explaining, explaining what! What was there to be guilty about? I don’t know.

I thought that once it was clear, there would be no more issues, but I clearly felt that he came to get water less often, and his face was full of suspicion… One day, when there was a movie not worth watching, I returned to my room to read. Someone knocked on the door, and it was the old painter. He hesitated for a while and then handed me a small bucket of paint, “This… you might need it, it’s from home, not from the hospital, put it away, don’t let others see… it’s hard to explain.”

I was stunned, a faint sadness turning into cold disappointment, like a cool breeze blowing over my heart… I politely declined, but the book was no longer readable.

　　大橱的故事
　　阿威
    我宿舍有个大橱，刚做好，还没漆。
    一条夹道边是女兵宿舍，我的房间在路口，另一头是医院的油漆间。漆工是个老头。在只容一人走过的夹道里，他总是先给我们让路——侧身贴在墙上，白发碰着墙壁，似还在微微点头致歉。女兵们大概从小被让惯了，无人见怪。或许觉得我们是当然的主人，而他不过是个民工。我却为那挨着墙壁的白发不安，逢相遇，抢先让开。他怕有６０多岁了吧。
    开始他还寒暄着与我谦让，后来就嘿嘿笑着猛地加快脚步。再后来他敢跟我打招呼了——上班啦，休息呵，上街哇？我又不安，虽不善客套仍抢先说着——上班啦，休息呵，吃饭啦？他竟会那么高兴，走过好远，还听见他在得意地嘿嘿着。
    他爱看电影，常问我：“不去俱乐部看电影啊？”他管电视也叫电影。彩电室里，他张着嘴，伸着脖儿，头上每根白发都那么聚精会神。
    一次礼堂放电影，他被拦住了，我帮他解了围。后来就常给他票，他嘿嘿的笑声中增添了不少感激的成分。
    夏天电影改在操场放，他远远站在人群后面，张着嘴，伸着脖儿，头上每根白发都那么聚精会神……我告诉他我有两把竹椅，可以借他一把。
    每次他来还椅子至少要说四个以上的谢谢。大概是在一次瞟到那个没漆的大橱后才改说两个了，并且再碰到我时，总似乎在等我说什么。
    终于有一天，他还了椅子没走，说要帮我漆大橱，我愣了一下，连说不必。他不走，说不要钱，少睡会儿觉就得。我再三解释，他才满腹狐疑地走了。这之后，他嘿嘿的笑声中夹进了不安。
    不久，他挺神秘地对我说，他可以到我房里来漆，绝不给——用手朝上戳戳——知道。我笑了，只好又一番解释……这之后，他不再别别扭扭叫我同志而改为挺顺口的“姑娘”了。“姑娘，一人在这想家吧？”“惯了，老师傅。”“害怕吧，那么晚还点着灯？”“不是，老师傅，我在看书。”“噢！怪不得，你跟旁人不一样，知书识礼呀！……”我又愣了，还从没有人这么恭维过我这个初中没读完的人呢。
    一天，我下了夜班在睡觉，有人轻敲门，我不想起来——谁呵？传来声熟悉的咳嗽，竟是老漆工！他穿得干干净净，浑身上下不见一星油漆，白发也像梳理过。“姑娘，我活儿完该回去了，在这儿尽麻烦你，你待我真好，以后用得着我……”他边说边瞟着大橱，我下意识接过他的地址，想说他并没麻烦我，我也没怎么待他好，我将来不用他帮我漆家具。但我什么也说不出，心里挺难过，好像丢了什么心爱的东西。
    翌年，院里又雇了一个老漆工，他不爱看电影，也不爱跟人打招呼。不过迎面碰上也是背贴墙让路，我也是抢先让他，但却不打算再和他搭话。
    一次，发现他在接生水喝，从卫生的角度我不得不加以干涉，他先是吓了一跳，等明白我是为他着想才连说：“惯了，惯了。”“锅炉房有开水呵！”“太远，麻烦。”“我那儿有，您来倒吧，没几步远。”至少这样讲过三次，他才真的来倒了，每次都局促不安的，好像倒给他的是人参汤。直到一次他发现那个没漆的大橱后才变得坦然了。我不由心头一颤，慌忙一阵表白，表白什么！有什么可心虚的？不知道。
    原以为明说了，就没事儿了，可我分明觉得他倒水的次数少了，而且满脸的皱纹都透着猜测……一天，碰上部不值得看的电影，我回房看书，有人敲门，是老漆工。　他支吾了一阵，忽然递过手里拎着的一小桶油漆，“这个……用得着，自家的，不是医院的，放妥，别给人家看见……讲不清。”
    我愣着，一丝淡淡的忧伤化作冷冷的失望，似凉风拂过心头……我婉言谢绝了，书却再也看不下去。
