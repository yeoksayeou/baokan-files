Nearly 100 people from various sectors in the Soviet Far East boarded a flight today, crossing the Bering Strait to reach Anchorage, the largest city in the U.S. state of Alaska, for trade talks and tourism. This marks the first time the Soviet Union has opened an air route from the Far East to Alaska.

The Chairman of the Soviet of the Magadan Oblast Executive Committee, Kobets, said at Anchorage International Airport that the visiting Soviet delegation members could not suppress their inner excitement.

This visit is seen as a new breakthrough in the efforts by the U.S. and the Soviet Union to thaw the ice that connects the two countries.

    新华社华盛顿２月２０日电  近百名苏联远东地区各界人士今天乘飞机越过白令海峡，到达美国阿拉斯加州第一大城市安克雷奇进行贸易谈判和旅游。这是苏联第一次开通从远东地区到阿拉斯加空中联系。
    苏联马加丹州苏维埃主席团主席科贝茨在安克雷奇国际机场上说，来访的苏联代表团成员无法抑制内心的激动。
    这次访问被认为是美苏在使两国相连的坚冰融化的尝试方面取得了新的突破。
