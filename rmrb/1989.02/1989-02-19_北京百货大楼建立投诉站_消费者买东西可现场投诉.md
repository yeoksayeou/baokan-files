Beijing Department Store Establishes Complaint Station
Consumers Can File Complaints On-Site

According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 18 (Reporter Ni Xiaolin) Beijing Department Store began accepting consumer complaints about product quality and service quality on-site today. This is the fifth complaint station established by the China Consumer Association in major shopping malls nationwide. According to a responsible person from the China Consumer Association, Beijing's Dong'an Market and major shopping malls in Hebei, Wuhan, and Xuzhou have already established four complaint stations. This practice will continue to be promoted in large and medium-sized shopping malls across the country.

The advantage of shopping malls accepting on-site complaints is that it solves the long-standing problem of consumers having no way to file complaints. Since Dong'an Market in Beijing established its complaint station on January 7 this year, it has already received 144 consumer complaints, allowing issues to be resolved promptly.

　　北京百货大楼建立投诉站    
    消费者买东西可现场投诉
    据新华社北京２月１８日电  （记者倪小林）北京市百货大楼今天开始在店内现场接待消费者投诉产品质量、服务质量的问题。这是中国消费者协会在全国大型商场建立的第五个维护消费者合法权益的投诉站。据中国消费者协会负责人介绍，北京东安市场和河北、武汉、徐州等地大型商场已先后建立了四个投诉站，这种作法将继续在各地大中型商场推开。
    商场接受现场投诉的好处是解决了消费者长期以来投诉无门的苦恼。北京市东安市场今年１月７日设立投诉站后，已接受了１４４起消费者的投诉，使问题得到及时解决。
