Li Peng and Benazir Bhutto Hold Talks
Exchange Views on Current International Situation and Bilateral Relations

	BEIJING, Feb. 12 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng held talks with Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto this morning at the Great Hall of the People. The two sides exchanged views on the current international situation and bilateral relations and introduced each other's foreign policies. They also had an in-depth exchange of views on further developing economic and technological cooperation.

	Benazir Bhutto said that Pakistan-China relations have a history of nearly 40 years and have become mature. Pakistan-China friendship is the cornerstone of Pakistan's foreign relations. This relationship is based on mutual trust and is characterized by multi-faceted development and cooperation. She hoped that the Pakistan People's Party government would play a new role in promoting Pakistan-China friendly relations.

	She said that Pakistan and China have consistent views on major international issues such as Afghanistan and Cambodia. Pakistan's stance on the Afghan issue has received political and moral support from China.

	Benazir Bhutto expressed the hope for further development in educational, tourism, and commercial exchanges between the two countries. She said that on the basis of mutual benefit, the potential of bilateral trade should be further tapped. She also expressed support for China's proposal to establish a new international political order based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

	Benazir Bhutto invited Li Peng to visit Pakistan. Li Peng expressed his thanks and said he would be willing to visit Pakistan within the year.

	Li Peng said that the current international situation has eased, and hotspot issues are being politically resolved, which is a welcome development. Although the factors for world peace are increasing, the factors for war still exist, and we must remain vigilant.

	Regarding Sino-Soviet relations, he said that the improvement of Sino-Soviet relations is a normalization of relations between the two countries and is not directed against any third country.

	He said that the international and domestic aspects of the Cambodian issue are inseparable. After the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops, we firmly advocate the establishment of a provisional joint government led by Prince Sihanouk. If the Cambodian issue is not resolved fairly and reasonably, there will be no significant improvement in Sino-Vietnamese relations. Regarding the Afghan issue, Li Peng said that we are concerned about the current civil war situation in Afghanistan. We do not want this situation to escalate. China hopes to form a broad-based and acceptable united government in Afghanistan to achieve peace.

	Regarding bilateral relations, Li Peng said that China-Pakistan relations are excellent. Assistance is mutual. China is still a developing country, and we have helped Pakistan, but this assistance is limited. At the same time, we have also received help from Pakistan. Our relationship is based on equality and mutual benefit.

	The talks lasted three and a half hours. The atmosphere was warm and friendly. Those who participated in the talks included Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and Pakistani Foreign Minister Yaqub Khan, among others.

　　李鹏同贝·布托举行会谈    
    就当前国际形势和双边关系交换意见
    本报北京２月１２日讯  记者温宪报道：李鹏总理今天上午在人民大会堂同巴基斯坦总理贝·布托举行了会谈。双方就当前国际形势和双边关系交换了意见，并相互介绍了各自的对外关系。双方就进一步发展经贸、技术合作关系具体交换了意见。
    贝·布托总理说，巴中关系有近４０年的历史，两国关系已经成熟。巴中友谊是巴对外关系的基石。这是基于相互信任基础上的关系，它的特点是多方面发展，多方面合作。她希望巴人民党政府将为巴中友好关系起新的促进作用。
    她说，巴中两国对阿富汗、柬埔寨等重大国际问题看法一致。巴在阿富汗问题上的立场得到了中国在政治上和道义上的支持。
    贝·布托表示希望巴中在教育、旅游、商业方面的交流有进一步发展。她说，应在互利基础上进一步发挥两国贸易的潜力。她表示支持中国关于在和平共处五项原则基础上建立国际政治新秩序的主张。
    贝·布托邀请李鹏访问巴基斯坦。李鹏对此表示感谢，表示愿意在年内访巴。
    李鹏总理说，当前国际形势出现了缓和，热点问题都在进行政治解决，这是值得欢迎的。当今世界和平的因素虽在增长，但战争的因素仍然存在，对此要提高警惕。
    谈到中苏关系时，他说，中苏关系的改善是两国关系正常化，不会针对任何第三国。
    他说，柬埔寨问题的国际和国内两方面不可分割。越南撤军后，我们坚决主张建立以西哈努克亲王为首的四方临时联合政府。如果柬埔寨问题得不到公正、合理的解决，中越关系不可能有大的改善。关于阿富汗问题，李鹏说，我们对阿国内现在出现的内战局势表示关注。我们不希望这种局面进一步发展。中国希望在阿富汗组成一个基础广泛、能为各方所接受的联合政府，在阿富汗实现和平。
    在谈到双边关系时，李鹏说，中巴关系很好。援助是相互的。中国还是发展中国家，我们帮助了巴基斯坦，这种帮助是有限的，同时也得到了巴基斯坦的帮助。我们的关系是以平等互利为基础的。
    会谈进行了三个半小时。会谈的气氛热情、友好。参加会谈的还有中国外长钱其琛和巴基斯坦外长雅各布·汗等。
