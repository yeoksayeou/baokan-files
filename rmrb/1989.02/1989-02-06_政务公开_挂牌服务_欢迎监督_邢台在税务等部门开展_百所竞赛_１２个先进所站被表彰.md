A competition involving 152 grassroots units from eight departments, including taxation, public security, industry and commerce, and power supply, has been vigorously carried out in Xingtai City, Hebei Province, for half a year. On January 23, the Xingtai Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Government issued a notice, commending the first batch of 12 advanced units.

Last June, Xingtai City placed the construction of clean governance on the important agenda, organizing the taxation, industry and commerce, public security, power supply, and other systems to carry out comprehensive governance and promote clean governance in the form of a "hundred units competition."

The West Dajie Tax Bureau in Xingtai acted quickly. They implemented the "six public" system, including tax laws, management, penalties, and exemptions, and publicly posted the information, which was well received by the public. Subsequently, the Industrial and Commercial Bureau, Public Security Bureau, and grassroots units of the financial, power supply, price, and housing management departments followed the example of the West Dajie Tax Bureau, successively publicizing the laws, disciplines, procedures, and results of their respective units.

To facilitate public supervision, the public service personnel of the participating units all implemented a sign-in system. The cards have the individual's number, and anyone who finds them engaging in illegal or disciplinary actions can report it. The supervision, inspection, and discipline inspection departments closely cooperate, set up a reporting center, publicize the reporting telephone number, and place more than 120 reporting boxes throughout the city.

This method of placing administrative activities under public supervision has constrained the behavior of public servants and eliminated the arbitrariness of the staff. Since the implementation of public taxation for half a year, 158 people in the city have voluntarily paid back taxes totaling 93,600 yuan. During the tax collection period from the 1st to the 7th of each month, long queues of people paying taxes form at the tax bureau's door. The collection rate during the collection period is 100% each month. The West Dajie Tax Bureau, which first implemented the "six public" system, completed its annual tax collection target of 719,000 yuan 72 days ahead of schedule.

After implementing administrative transparency, the city publicly propagandized policies and publicly announced indicators when handling "agricultural to non-agricultural" household registrations. In the past half year, all 848 "agricultural to non-agricultural" household registrations handled complied with policy regulations. The wife of Zhang Hengwei, an employee of the Materials Management Bureau, had her right arm amputated at a high position and could not take care of herself. He did not apply, and the public security bureau actively changed her household registration to "agricultural to non-agricultural."

Most of the units participating in the Xingtai City Hundred Units Competition have established a "Record of Intercession and Gift-Giving." Anyone who comes to give gifts or intercede, whether they are state cadres or the public, must state the reason, leave their name, and post it out.

Implementing administrative transparency has also effectively enhanced the democratic consciousness of the people. When public servants engage in misconduct, higher authorities can quickly receive reports. A public security bureau unit's staff member handled a case at a banquet and released a person who was supposed to be administratively detained for 15 days 11 days in advance, and was immediately exposed by the public.

　　政务公开　挂牌服务　欢迎监督
　　邢台在税务等部门开展“百所竞赛”
　　１２个先进所站被表彰
    本报讯  一项包括税务、公安、工商、供电等８个部门，１５２个基层所、站在内的廉洁执法“百所竞赛”活动，有声有色地在河北省邢台市开展了半年。１月２３日，中共邢台市委、市人民政府发出通报，表彰了第一批涌现的１２个先进所、站。
    去年６月，邢台市把廉政建设提到重要议事日程，组织税务、工商、公安、供电等系统，以“百所竞赛”的形式，进行综合治理，推进廉政建设。
    邢台市的西大街税务所行动较快。他们实行了包括税法、征管、处罚、减免等内容的“六公开”，张榜公布，受到了市民的好评。紧接着，工商局、公安局以及金融、供电、物价、房管等部门的基层单位都效法西大街税务所的做法，相继公开了本单位的法规、纪律、办事程序和结果。
    为了便于群众监督，参加竞赛单位的公务人员一律实行挂牌上岗，牌证上标有本人编号，任何人只要发现他们有违法、违纪行为，都可以举报。监察、检查、纪检部门密切配合，设立了举报中心，公开了举报电话，在全市挂置了１２０多个举报箱。
    这种置政务活动于群众监督之下的做法，约束了公职人员的行为，消除了工作人员的随意性。实行公开办税半年来，全市已有１５８人主动补缴税款９．３６万元。每月１日至７日的收税期，税务所门口缴税的人排起了长队，征期入库率每月为１００％，最早实行“六公开”的西大街税务所提前７２天完成全年７１．９万元的税收任务。
    实行政务公开后，全市在办理“农转非”户口时，公开宣传政策，公开指标，定期张榜公布办理结果。半年中办理的８４８个“农转非”户口全部符合政策规定。物资管理局职工张恒伟的妻子右臂高位截肢，生活不能自理，自己没有申报，派出所主动将其户口“农转非”。
    参加邢台市百所竞赛的单位，大多数建立了《说情送礼登记簿》。凡来送礼、说情者，无论国家干部，还是群众，都要说明来由，留下姓名，张贴出去。
    实行政务公开，也有效地增强了人民群众的民主意识。公务人员出现越轨行为，上级机关便可很快接到举报。公安局某单位工作人员酒桌办案，提前１１天释放了原定行政拘留１５天的人，立即被群众揭发。（谢占铎　苏根路）
