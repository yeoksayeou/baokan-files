The Ershanxi Color Picture Tube Factory, the first in China's northwestern region to enter the national second-level enterprise category, exceeded its production quota by 15.6% last year, completing the state-assigned plan of producing 1 million color picture tubes. The factory sold the excess 110,000 tubes at the state-set price to three television assembly plants in Shaanxi Province and the local city of Xianyang. This move was well-received by the public.

Over the past year, the Ershanxi Color Picture Tube Factory faced two major challenges. First, it underwent its first large-scale equipment overhaul since starting production five years ago. Second, it dealt with rising raw material prices, currency appreciation, tight loan conditions, and insufficient power supply. New factory director Zhang Wenyi told reporters that, in response to these challenges, the factory promptly renewed its contract with the supervising department, linking wage totals to tax payments. Internally, the factory implemented production responsibility systems, piecework wage systems, equipment overhaul labor contracts, and selective internal bidding for some departments, introducing competition and risk mechanisms. Reforms were also made in personnel and wage distribution systems, effectively motivating employees' production enthusiasm. The Assembly Division achieved its highest monthly production level despite a one-month shutdown for equipment overhaul.

The factory's total industrial output value reached 450 million yuan last year, with a total profit and tax revenue increase of 29% compared to the previous year. It ranked among the top tax contributors in Shaanxi Province.

The factory focused on improving economic benefits without resorting to price increases. Instead, it concentrated on enhancing product quality and reducing material consumption. Statistics show that energy consumption per 10,000 yuan of output decreased by 20.7% compared to the previous year. The pass rate of finished products also improved significantly, increasing the factory's income by 10.5264 million yuan. Facing financial difficulties, the factory strengthened professional management, reducing the turnover days of working capital by 20% compared to the previous year. It also mobilized employees to raise production funds, with the approval of the Shaanxi Branch of the People's Bank of China, issuing over 20,000 shares of "internal stocks" in the fourth quarter of last year, raising over 10 million yuan.

In recent years, the "color TV boom" has swept the nation. As a key component of color TV assembly, color picture tubes have become even more popular. Many television manufacturers from other provinces and cities were willing to purchase their tubes at prices one to two times higher than the state-set price. However, this nationally awarded enterprise strictly adhered to policies, selling the excess color picture tubes at the state-set price to television manufacturers. This move increased the financial revenue of financially strained Shaanxi Province by 30 million yuan.

### 陕西彩色显像管总厂超产不卖高价　彩管平价售出后为地方财政增收三千万元

　　陕西彩色显像管总厂超产不卖高价
　　彩管平价售出后为地方财政增收三千万元
    本报西安电  记者景险峰报道：我国西北地区最早进入国家二级企业行列的陕西彩色显像管总厂，在超额１５．６％完成国家下达的去年生产彩色显像管１００万只的计划之后，将超产的１１万多只彩管按国家定价售给陕西省内３家彩电整机厂和驻地咸阳市。此举深得民心。
    在过去的一年里，陕西彩色显像管总厂经受了两大考验。一是投产５年多来第一次大规模检修设备；二是原材料涨价、外汇升值和贷款紧缺、电力供应不足。新任厂长张文义告诉记者，面对这些考验，厂里同主管部及时续签了“工资总额同上缴利税挂钩”承包责任制；企业内部实行了生产承包责任制、计件工资制、设备大修劳务承包等责任制，并有选择地对厂内一些部门进行了厂内招标，引入竞争机制和风险机制，在人事制度、工资分配制度上均作出相应改革，有效地调动了职工的生产积极性。总装分厂在设备大修停产一个月的情况下，创造了投产以来的月产最高水平。
    该厂去年完成工业总产值４．５亿元，实现利税总额比上年增长２９％。在陕西省利税大户名录中，名列前茅。
    该厂提高经济效益绝不在涨价上打主意，而是在提高产品质量和降低物耗上下功夫。据统计，万元产值能源消耗比上年降低２０．７％；成品率较上年有明显提高，使工厂增加收入１０５２．６４万元。面对资金紧缺的困难，该厂一方面加强专业管理，使流动资金周转天数比上年减少２０％，另一方面发动职工筹集生产基金，经中国人民银行陕西省分行批准，去年第四季度已在工厂内部发行“厂内股票”２万余股，集资１０００多万元。
    近两年，“彩电热”波及全国，彩电显像管作为总装彩电的“心脏”部件，比以往更加走俏。外省、市的不少彩电厂家愿以高出国家牌价一二倍的价格，购买他们的彩管。可是，这家获国家金质奖的企业，严格执行政策，将超产的彩色显像管平价出售给电视机生产厂家。此举，为地方财政拮据的陕西省增加财政收入３０００万元。
