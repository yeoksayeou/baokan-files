On the evening of February 21, the Haikou Customs' 705 anti-smuggling vessel intercepted the "Linyun 01" ship from Hainan Province in the Qiongzhou Strait near the Leizhou Peninsula. The ship was found to be carrying 2,600 cases of imported cigarettes, including brands such as "Hilton," "Lianyou," and "Marlboro."

Preliminary investigations revealed that the six smugglers were all from Luofu County, Guangdong Province. The cigarettes were transferred from a Hong Kong smuggling vessel.

It is understood that this case is the first major sea-based cigarette smuggling case intercepted by Haikou Customs in recent years.
