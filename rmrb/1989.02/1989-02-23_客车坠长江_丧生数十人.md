A bus carrying more than 60 passengers plunged into the Yangtze River this morning at the Shashi South Bank ferry terminal. Only 13 people survived, while the rest perished. The bus is currently at the bottom of the river, 8 meters deep, and rescue efforts are underway.

The bus belongs to the Donggang Loading and Unloading Company in Gong'an County, Hubei Province, and is used for long-distance passenger transport. According to survivors, the bus was in poor condition and had faulty brakes. This morning at 7:55 AM, the bus, fully loaded with passengers, departed from Gong'an County. Around 11:20 AM, the bus arrived at the Juejinzhou ferry terminal on the opposite shore of Shashi. The driver, who was repairing the car by placing stones under the wheels while waiting to board the ferry, stopped the repairs when he saw the preceding vehicles starting to board. However, due to the faulty brakes, the bus could not slow down when the preceding vehicle did. To avoid a collision, the driver panicked and turned the steering wheel to the right, shouting to the passengers, "Everyone, stay still." With the brakes failing, the bus slid down the pier and into the river.

Survivors expressed outrage at the transport company's disregard for safety and profit-driven practices, which they said put passengers' lives at risk.

After the accident, the Shashi Maritime Administration and Port Supervision Office quickly dispatched rescue boats. Leaders from Shashi City and Jingzhou Prefecture also rushed to the scene.

　　客车坠长江　丧生数十人
    新华社武汉２月２２日电  今日上午，有一辆载有６０多名乘客的长途公共汽车，在沙市南岸汽车渡口码头滑入长江，除１３人侥幸生还外，其他人全部遇难。目前，汽车仍在８米深的江底，打捞工作正紧张进行。
    这辆客车属湖北省公安县东港装卸公司，是专门从事营运的长途客车。据生还者介绍，这辆车已十分破旧，刹车也不灵。今日上午７点５５分，这辆车满载乘客从公安县出发，上午１１点２０分左右，车到沙市对岸的窖金州汽车码头。司机在候船时，便下车用石头塞在轮下修车。但未等修好，司机见前边的汽车开始上船，便停止修车，尾随前车上船。但由于刹车不灵，当前面的车减速上船时，这辆客车已无法制动，司机为避免与前车相撞，便慌乱地将方向盘往右打，一面大声对乘客喊：“大家不要动。”随着喊声，这辆刹车失灵的客车便沿着码头引道滑入了江中。
    侥幸生还者对汽车营运部门只顾盈利，不注意安全、拿乘客生命当儿戏的行为非常义愤。
    事故发生后，沙市市航政处、港监所迅速派出了营救船，沙市市和荆州地委领导均赶赴现场。
