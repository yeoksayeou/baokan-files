The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Legal Affairs Committee Vice Chairman, Xia Chunyi, today reported to the Standing Committee on the results of the review of the draft "Law of the People's Republic of China on the Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases." He said that the Legal Affairs Committee believes that it is necessary to formulate a law on the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases to prevent, control, and eliminate the occurrence and spread of infectious diseases and to safeguard public health. The draft is basically feasible. At the same time, some suggestions for revision were proposed.

He said that some health departments and medical experts have suggested changing the name of this law to the "Law on the Management of Infectious Diseases." Some committee members believe it is better to name it the "Law on the Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases." Based on the opinions of some committee members, some localities, departments, and medical experts, after discussions with the Legislative Affairs Office of the State Council and the Ministry of Health, it is suggested that the name of this law be changed to the "Law on Infectious Diseases."

Xia Chunyi said that some localities, departments, and experts have proposed that the provisions in Chapter VI of the draft on legal responsibilities are too general and may be difficult to enforce. After joint research with relevant parties and experts, it is suggested to modify as follows:

1. For those who have any of the following behaviors, administrative penalties are stipulated: “(1) The drinking water supplied by water supply units does not meet the national health standards”; “(2) Refusal to disinfect and treat sewage, waste, and feces contaminated with infectious disease pathogens as required by health and epidemic prevention agencies”; “(3) Allowing or tolerating infectious disease patients, carriers, and suspected infectious disease patients to engage in work that the national health administrative department prohibits from engaging in, which may cause the spread of the infectious disease”; “(4) Refusal to implement other preventive and control measures proposed by health and epidemic prevention agencies in accordance with this law.” For those who have any of the above behaviors, “causing the spread of Class A infectious diseases or posing a serious risk of spread,” it is stipulated to pursue criminal responsibility in accordance with relevant provisions of the Criminal Law.

2. For those who engage in the experiment, preservation, carrying, and transportation of infectious disease strains and toxins, and violate the relevant regulations of the national health administrative department, causing the spread of infectious disease strains and toxins, and for those who engage in the medical care, health and epidemic prevention, and supervision and management of infectious diseases, and for government-related personnel who neglect their duties, causing the spread or outbreak of infectious diseases, administrative penalties or criminal responsibilities are stipulated in accordance with the law.

　　人大法律委员会提出建议    
    将传染病防治法更名为传染病法
    新华社北京２月１５日电  全国人大法律委员会副主任委员项淳一今天在向人大常委会作法律委员会对《中华人民共和国传染病防治法（草案）》审议结果的报告时说，法律委员会认为，为了预防、控制和消除传染病的发生和流行，保障人体健康，制订传染病防治法很有必要，草案基本上是可行的。同时，提出一些修改意见。
    他说，有些卫生部门和医学专家主张把本法名称改为传染病管理法，有的委员认为还是定为传染病防治法为好，根据有的委员、有些地方、部门和医学专家的意见，经与国务院法制局、卫生部研究，建议将本法的名称改为《传染病法》。
    项淳一说，有些地方、部门和专家提出，草案第六章关于法律责任的规定过于笼统，执行时可能有困难。经与有关方面和专家共同研究，建议修改为：
    １、对有下列行为之一的，规定给予行政处罚：“（一）供水单位供应的饮用水不符合国家规定的卫生标准的”；“（二）拒绝按照卫生防疫机构提出的卫生要求，对传染病病原体污染的污水、污物、粪便进行消毒处理的”；“（三）准许或者纵容传染病病人、病原携带者和疑似传染病病人从事国务院卫生行政部门规定禁止从事的易使该传染病扩散的工作的”；“（四）拒绝执行卫生防疫机构依照本法提出的其他预防、控制措施的”。并对有上列行为之一，“引起甲类传染病传播或者有传播严重危险的”，规定比照刑法有关规定追究刑事责任。
    ２、对“从事实验、保藏、携带、运输传染病菌种、毒种的人员，违反国务院卫生行政部门的有关规定，造成传染病菌种、毒种扩散”和“从事传染病的医疗保健、卫生防疫、监督管理的人员和政府有关主管人员玩忽职守，造成传染病传播或者流行的”，分别规定给予行政处分或者依法追究刑事责任。
