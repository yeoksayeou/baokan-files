    Maintaining Social Order and Combating Criminal Behavior
    Tai County's Mass Security Information Volunteers Active in Urban and Rural Areas

    People's Daily reports: In Jiangsu Province's Tai County, 4,868 volunteers, selected by the masses, work without pay to assist the public security departments. Last year, they helped capture dozens of criminals.

    Last year, criminal cases increased nationwide, with a notable rise in roaming criminals. The Tai County public security departments promptly informed the masses of this situation and called on them to participate in combating criminal behavior. Villages, institutions, and enterprises voluntarily selected volunteer information officers. Almost every township and street established an information station. Upon seeing any criminal behavior or signs, the information officers immediately report it. On December 9 last year, four habitual thieves from Anhui committed dozens of crimes in Anhui and Jiangsu's Nanjing, Jiangdu, and other places, then fled to Tai County. They carried knives and pliers and broke into a workers' dormitory. The masses discovered and caught one on the spot, while three escaped. The factory's information officer, worker Song Hongzhi, immediately reported to the police station. The public security organs set up a net, and in the afternoon, they captured the three escaped habitual thieves at a private hotel. In Liangxu Township's Fengduo Village, a young woman had a relationship with Feng from Jianhu County, but later decided to end it. Feng threatened to "fight to the death." The information officers promptly reported this, and the relevant departments made preparations to prevent the danger. When Feng came to seek revenge, he was promptly arrested. A bottle of sulfuric acid, a triangular knife, and two daggers were found on him, preventing a serious incident from occurring.
