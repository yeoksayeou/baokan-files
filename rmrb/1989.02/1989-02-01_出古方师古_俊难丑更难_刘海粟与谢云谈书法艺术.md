In 1987 at the Yuanwang Building in Beijing, and in 1988 at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse, Master Liu Hai Su had two lengthy academic discussions with calligrapher Xie Yun. The following is an excerpt:

Xie Yun: Over a decade ago, in Guilin, I studied the "Praise of the Praise of the Sloping Path" with Master Li Luo Gong. Later, in Nanning, I studied the "Praise of the Idle Pavilion" with Wen Hui. This made us realize the wisdom in Fu Shan's words, "Better to be clumsy than clever, better to be ugly than flattering." Unfortunately, achieving such a state is difficult.

Liu Hai Su: "Ugly" refers to breaking conventions, surpassing old aesthetic habits, and achieving a higher level of beauty through abruptness, sincerity, and lack of adornment. This also includes a kind of naive beauty that is elevated and powerful. Those who cannot write well or have a low level of attainment stop at cleverness. However, one must understand "flattering" correctly. In ancient times, it was not a derogatory term. The "Book of Jin" says of Wang Xizhi: "Contemporary critics said that Xizhi's cursive and official script were unmatched in the Jiangnan region and the central court. Xian Zhi's bone strength was far inferior to his father's, but he had a bit of charm." Xian Zhi's disciple Yang Xin also said that his teacher's "bone strength was not as good as his father's, but his charm was superior." Wang Song Qian commented on Zhi Chao's calligraphy, saying, "His tight and charming style surpassed his father's, but his bone strength was not as good." He also said that Xie Zong's calligraphy was powerful but lacked charm. Generally, charm and strength are opposites that complement each other. After the Five Dynasties, charm came to mean softness and weakness, and charm and strength became derogatory terms.

Xie Yun: How should one write with charm and strength in opposition and unity?

Liu Hai Su: I also don't know how. Being too skilled will lead to vulgarity. One must be familiar yet fresh, familiar after being fresh. Writing is different for everyone. Looking at your calligraphy, it has the style of Yan and Liu, starting early and later writing Han inscriptions, from dissimilarity to similarity. Wen Hui advocates starting with seal script, bypassing the various styles of the Tang Dynasty, and for those with exceptional talent, tracing back to small seal and bronze inscriptions. Only after mastering the basics should one study the famous calligraphy of the Tang Dynasty and later. Your calligraphy has spirit and basic skills, which is better than those who innovate without basic skills. You have combined the naive charm of a child with the emotional elements of an adult, turning them into living lines. When you copy the "Stone Gate Praise" and the "Zhang Qian Stele," there is a lively spirit, and there is hope for breaking free. You must work a hundred times harder, and I must also work hard to break free. Let's have a friendly competition and strive together to reach a state of scattered form and concentrated spirit, naive yet sharp. To break free, one must prevent slipping. One must constantly return to the ancient forms, not just go once and never return, but also not be constrained. While returning, one must also say goodbye, walking further and further away from the ancients, but their spirit is not lost. Walking further and further away from oneself, but the new self is elevated. Your calligraphy has two shortcomings: first, the quality is not yet stable, sometimes good, sometimes not satisfying after writing several sheets. I think it's because you haven't written enough; second, you have a strong desire for beauty, not completely forgetting it. Paying too much attention to the outcome will lose the effect. You must believe that you can achieve stability in the quality of most of your works and eternal change in form. You have already reached the level of being strange yet not strange. With more effort and practice, you can enter the level of being ugly yet not ugly. I have high hopes for you. Compared to me, you are 30 years younger, with plenty of time, but you must also hurry. I give you a five-character quatrain: "Learning from the ancients and innovating, being handsome is difficult, being ugly is even more difficult. The Yellow Mountain adds a wonderful scene, the blue moon reflects the cold pond."

Xie Yun: Thank you, Master, for showing me the way. I understand that first, calligraphy must be nourished by the strange spirit of mountains and rivers and the righteousness of the nation; beauty and depth must be integrated; second, one must learn a bit of the essence of Zen, the blue moon's shadow in the cold pond, the pond and the moon are unrelated yet related, the temperatures are far apart, but they can be reflected yet not reached. One must enlighten oneself to a new truth.

Liu Hai Su: Gradual enlightenment is like the gradual change in dialectics, sudden enlightenment is like a sudden change, wonderful enlightenment is "ascending to a higher level" - a qualitative change. Unfortunately, I understood this truth too late, it's difficult to change! Precisely because it's difficult, one must change! If it's easy to change, changing has no value! One must not be satisfied with changing from a weasel to a cat, but must change into a magnificent dragon, tiger, lion, or elephant! Even if one cannot change, effort will not be in vain.

　　出古方师古　俊难丑更难
    ——刘海粟与谢云谈书法艺术
    １９８７年在北京远望楼，１９８８年在钓鱼台国宾馆，刘海粟先生对书法家谢云作了两次长篇学术谈话。摘录如下：
    谢云：十多年前在桂林与李骆公先生一起研究《褒斜道》，后来在南宁与文辉研究《郙阁颂》，使我们体会到傅山讲的“宁拙勿巧，宁丑勿媚”极有道理，可惜做起来达不到那种境界。
    刘海粟：丑，指打破常规，突破欣赏的旧习惯，在突兀、坦诚、无修饰中达到一种高层次的美，其中也包含升华之后功力雄厚的稚拙美。不会写字或境界不高的人，到巧便止步了。但是对媚要有正确理解，在古代并非贬义词，《晋书·王羲之传》说：“时议者以为羲之草隶，江左中朝莫有及者。献之骨力远不及父，而颇有媚趣”。献之弟子羊欣也说乃师“骨力不及父而媚趣过之。”王僧虔评郗超的字“紧媚过其父，骨力不及也。”又说谢综“书法有力，恨少媚好”。大抵是遒媚对立统一，五代之后媚指柔靡乏力，媚骨变成贬义词了。
    谢云：遒媚对立统一，应该怎样写呢？
    刘海粟：我也不会写，太会写必流于滑俗，还是要熟中有生，熟后之生。写字因人而异。看你的字，是颜柳出身，起步早，后来写汉碑，从不似到形似。文辉主张从隶书入门，绕过唐代以后各家，秉赋优异者上溯小篆金文，到底子过硬后再读唐后名帖。你的字有灵气和基本功，这比无基本功的创新家有条件形成个人面目。你将儿童的稚拙之趣和成年人的感情因素，化为活的线条，去临《石门颂》、《张迁碑》，有活脱生机，已经有脱出的希望，要百倍努力，我也要努力脱，友谊竞赛，共同奔赴形散神凝，似稚拙而老辣的境地。脱，要防止滑，一要常常回到古人形上去，不能一去不回头，又不要受束缚，一边回潮，一边告别，越走越离古人远，而其神不失，越走越离自我近，但新我有升华。你的字有两点不足：一是质上还不够稳定，有时很好，有时连写几张都不达意，我以为还是写少了；二是有牢固的求美意识，没有完全忘记，过于注意后果就会失去效果。要相信自己能达到大多数作品在质上的稳定和形式上的永不凝固。老弟已到奇而不奇的水准，再苦想苦练，进入丑而不丑的层次，我寄以厚望。与我相比，你小３０几岁，有的是时光，但也要抓紧。我赠你一首五言绝句：“出古方师古，俊难丑更难。黄山添妙境，碧月映寒潭。”
    谢云：多谢大师示我以无法之法。我体会到，第一书法要有山川奇气民族正气的滋养；美与厚才能浑然一体；第二要学习一点禅宗的精髓，碧月影在寒潭，潭月无关又有关，温度相去甚远，可照而不可及，要悟出一点新道理来。
    刘海粟：渐悟等于辩证法的渐变，顿悟近于突变，妙悟是“更上一层楼”──质变。可惜我懂此理太迟，难变啊！正因为难，才要变！容易变，变就没有价值！不能以黄鼠狼变猫而沾沾自喜，要变成壮观的龙、虎、狮、象来！变不成也不要紧，努力是不会落空的。
