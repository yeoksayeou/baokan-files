Borg Denies Drug Overdose Suicide Attempt

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 10th: According to foreign wire reports, former Swedish tennis star Borg refuted reports yesterday in an interview with an Italian television magazine that he had taken a large amount of barbiturates in a suicide attempt. He believed that such reports had caused "unfounded confusion."

According to reports, when discussing the reasons for taking barbiturates, Borg said: "That day, I ate something, and my stomach felt bad. Later, I drank some alcohol and took some sleeping pills. I don't remember anything else. They exaggerated the facts."

The 32-year-old Borg was sent to the hospital for emergency treatment by his fiancée, Italian singer Berté, on Tuesday. Italian news media immediately reported the incident and, without confirmation, labeled it a "failed suicide attempt." Berté said: "We had dinner at my apartment on Monday evening, and Borg took something from the refrigerator, which might not have been very fresh." She denied the rumors that she was pregnant and reiterated that she and Borg would soon get married.

The wedding between Berté and Borg was originally scheduled for February 26th, but due to ongoing divorce proceedings for both parties, it had to be postponed.

　　博格否认服药自杀
    新华社北京２月１０日电  据外电报道，瑞典前网球明星博格昨天在接受意大利电视杂志记者采访时，驳斥了有关他吞服大量巴比土盐酸是为了自杀的说法。他认为这种说法造成了“无中生有的混乱”。
    据报道，博格在谈到他服用巴比土盐酸的原因时说：“那天，我吃了些东西，胃很难受。后来，我喝了点酒，又服了点安眠药。其它的我就不记得了。他们夸大了事实。”
    ３２岁的博格星期二被未婚妻意大利歌星贝尔泰送往医院抢救，意大利的新闻媒介便立即报道了这一事件，并在没有得到证实的情况下称之为“自杀未遂”事件。贝尔泰说：“我俩星期一晚上在我的寓所里进餐，博格从冰箱里拿了点吃的，可能那些食物不太新鲜。”她否认了她已怀孕的说法，并且重申她与博格将很快成婚。
    贝尔泰与博格的婚礼原订于２月２６日举行，但由于双方的各自离婚官司尚未有结果而被迫延迟。
