145 postdoctoral research stations have been established.

356 domestic and foreign doctors have entered the stations to engage in high-level research work.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 10th: Reporter Wang Xiyuan reports that since China began implementing the postdoctoral research system in 1985, 145 postdoctoral research stations have been established in 89 units. A total of 356 individuals have entered these stations to conduct research, with 41 of them completing their first research period and securing permanent positions.

The postdoctoral research system is a mechanism for cultivating outstanding professionals. It involves setting up non-permanent positions in universities and research institutions where individuals who have obtained a doctoral degree can conduct research for a specific period.

Among the postdoctoral researchers in China, 225 have obtained their doctoral degrees domestically, accounting for 63.2% of the total. There are 127 individuals who obtained their doctoral degrees abroad, and an additional 4 foreign doctoral degree holders have also entered the stations. According to incomplete statistics, they have completed 86 research projects, including 19 key projects at the national, ministerial, provincial, and municipal levels. Three individuals have received national-level science and technology achievement awards, and 3 patents have been applied for. They have also published over 180 papers in domestic and international first-tier academic journals and international academic conferences.

Currently, the distribution of postdoctoral stations in China is as follows: 97 stations are set up in universities, and 48 stations are in research institutes. By discipline, there are 74 stations in the sciences, 65 in engineering, and 6 in medicine, agriculture, and other fields.

Today, the ninth national meeting of the Postdoctoral Research Station Management Coordination Committee, held in Beijing, revealed that China will appropriately expand the number of postdoctoral researchers while ensuring quality. The country plans to establish 40 more stations in 1989, increasing the proportion of stations in emerging disciplines, key disciplines, and high-tech fields. Additionally, a small number of stations will be set up in the social sciences as a trial.

　　１４５个博士后流动站建成    
    ３５６名中外博士进站从事高层次研究工作
    本报北京２月１０日讯  记者王溪元报道：我国自１９８５年试行博士后研究制度以来，已在８９个单位设立博士后科研流动站１４５个，进站进行这一研究工作的达到３５６人，其中４１人结束第一期研究工作，走上了固定工作岗位。
    博士后研究制度是一种造就优秀专业人才的制度，即在高等学校和研究机构设置一些不固定的职位，挑选一些获得博士学位的人员在这里从事一个阶段的研究工作。
    在我国进站的博士后人员中，有２２５人是在国内获得博士学位的，占总数的６３．２％；在外国取得博士学位的有１２７人。此外，还有４名外籍博士进站。据不完全统计，他们已完成科研课题８６项，其中属国家或部委省市重点项目１９项，有３人获得国家级科技成果奖，申报国家专利３项，并在国内外一级学术刊物和国际学术会议上发表论文１８０余篇。
    目前，我国各流动站的分布情况是：在高等学校设站９７个，在科研院所设站４８个；按学科分类，理学设站７４个，工学设站６５个，医学、农学等设站６个。
    今天在北京召开的第九次全国博士后科研流动站管理协调委员会会议披露，我国将在适当扩大招收博士后人员的数量和确保质量的同时，进一步完善有关政策规定，拟在１９８９年增设４０个流动站，扩大新兴学科、重点学科和高技术领域博士后流动站的比例，也将在社会科学领域适当设置少量流动站以作试点。
