On the morning of February 6, many women waited by the banks of the Amu Darya in the Termez town of Surkhandarya Oblast, Uzbekistan, Soviet Union. The river flowed quietly, and the cold wind gently blew. An important moment was about to arrive.

At 11 a.m., a tank with a red flag appeared on the opposite bank of the Amu Darya, followed by the second, third, and fourth tanks. The tank convoy rumbled across the iron bridge, returning from the war-torn skies of Afghanistan to Soviet territory. The military band began to play, and smiling young men and women rushed forward to offer flowers, bread, and salt to the returning soldiers.

This was the first batch of troops to return to the country by land since the Soviet Union resumed its withdrawal from Afghanistan this year. They left Kabul at 2 a.m. on February 3 and traveled over 450 kilometers to reach the banks of the Amu Darya. Before this, more than 30,000 Soviet soldiers had already returned by air.

In recent days, military families dressed in various ethnic costumes and speaking different local languages have come from all over the Soviet Union to Termez to welcome their loved ones. Hotels are full, and local leaders have arranged three train carriages as temporary accommodations for the families.

Batrovna, a rural teacher from the Bashkir Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, arrived in Termez on January 27 to wait for her son. She said, "I haven't seen my son in two years, my heart is breaking. My colleague Ruslan's son also went to Afghanistan, but he..." She could not speak any further.

Yekaterina from Ukraine had red eyes from crying. Her husband, Reznikov, had been in Afghanistan for over a year. Last month, he wrote to her to come to the banks of the Amu Darya to wait. When Reznikov appeared in the lineup, Yekaterina rushed towards the 31st Kamaz truck without hesitation. Her husband jumped out of the driver's seat, and they embraced each other.

The Shakir family from the city of Karshi in Uzbekistan—father, mother, brother, and sister—all came, carrying bags filled with apples, pomegranates, and dumplings. When a familiar soldier's figure appeared before them, the four shouted in unison, "Shakir!"

Petrov and his wife brought their son's fiancée, Zina, from the village of Parkany in the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic. They had planned that as soon as their son, Skrepyonik, returned, they would hold a wedding.

The Soviet Union sent troops to Afghanistan in December 1979. Over the course of nine years, despite strong resistance from the Afghan Mujahideen, the Soviet forces suffered over 50,000 casualties. Today, as they crossed the border, many soldiers shed tears. Lieutenant Colonel Skachkov said, "Of course, every soldier is happy to return. But it's a complex feeling, with a bitter taste..."

Sergeant Shergyenko said, "We finally made it back alive, but my comrades Kravchenko and Shumlyina were killed on New Year's Eve. Even yesterday, as we passed through the Salang Pass, someone died in an avalanche."

The soldier Vasili was only in his twenties, with blond hair, blue eyes, and a tall, slender build. He looked very tired. "I'm so exhausted, I just want to lie down and sleep. It was a painful and difficult war, a war that tortures people. I hope it never happens again," he said.

Akimov, a tank driver from the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic, decided to work in the vineyard after returning home. Berdyev, who grew up in the Kashkadarya Oblast, said he would work as a mechanic on a farm after returning home because he knew his hometown was in need of agricultural machinery operators.

On February 6 and 7, a total of 1,500 Soviet soldiers returned to Termez. Hundreds of Soviet and foreign journalists came here to report.

While Soviet troops were withdrawing to the banks of the Amu Darya, Soviet forces were also withdrawing to the Kushka region in the Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic via another route. Some of the troops will be disbanded soon after returning home.

　　苏军撤回阿姆河畔
　　新华社记者　王宪举
    2月6日清晨，许多妇女等待在苏联南部乌兹别克共和国苏尔汉州铁尔梅兹镇阿姆河畔。河水静静流淌，寒风轻轻吹拂，一个重要时刻即将到来。
    上午11时，一辆插着红旗的坦克出现在阿姆河对岸，接着出现了第2辆、第3辆、第4辆……坦克车队隆隆驶过铁桥，从战争乌云密布的阿富汗回到了苏联境内。军乐队开始奏乐，微笑的青年男女跑上前去，把鲜花、面包和盐献给归来的战士。
    这是苏联自今年1月恢复从阿富汗撤军以来，从地面上回国的首批部队。他们于2月3日凌晨2时离开喀布尔，历程450多公里，来到阿姆河畔。在这以前，已有3万多苏军士兵乘飞机回国。
    近日来，身穿各种民族服装、操不同地方语言的军属从苏联各地来到铁尔梅兹，迎接亲人。旅馆客满，地方领导调来3节列车车厢作为军属临时住宿处。
    巴什基里亚自治共和国农村教师巴特罗夫娜1月27日就来到铁尔梅兹，等待儿子归来。她说；“两年没见儿子，我的心都快碎了。我的同事鲁斯兰的儿子也去了阿富汗，但是不久前他在那里……”她泣不成声。
    来自乌克兰的叶卡捷琳娜已经哭红了眼睛。她丈夫列兹尼科夫去阿富汗一年多了。上个月他来信叫她到阿姆河畔等待。当列兹尼科夫出现在队伍中，叶卡捷琳娜不顾一切地向31号卡马斯载重汽车奔去，丈夫从驾驶室里跳下来，两人拥抱在一起。
    乌兹别克卡尔什市绍基尔一家——父母亲、弟弟、妹妹都来了，手提着的网袋里装满了苹果、石榴和饺子。当一个熟悉的战士身影映入他们眼帘时，4张口同声高喊：“绍基尔！……”
    彼得夫妇带着儿子的未婚妻济娜从摩尔达维亚共和国帕尔卡纳村赶来。他们商量好，儿子斯克雷普尼克一回来，就举行婚礼。
    苏联于1979年12月出兵阿富汗，在阿富汗游击队的强大抵抗下，9年来部队伤亡5万多人。今天，当越过国界时，许多战士流下了眼泪。中校斯卡奇科夫说：“当然，每个战士都为回来而高兴。但这是一种复杂的心情，其中包括着苦味……”。
    准尉谢尔吉延科说：“我们终于活着回来了，可我的战友克拉夫琴科和舒姆利纳在新年前夕牺牲了。甚至昨天我们经过萨朗山口时，还有人在雪崩中丧生。”
    战士瓦西里才20多岁，黄头发，蓝眼睛，细高个儿，他显得很疲惫。“我累极了，真想立刻躺下睡一会。痛苦而艰难的战争，折磨人的战争，我希望它永远不再发生。”他说。
    来自阿塞拜疆共和国的坦克手阿基莫夫决定回家后到葡萄园劳动。在卡什达卡里亚州长大的贝尔德耶夫则表示回家后将在农庄当一名机务人员。因为他知道，他的家乡正缺少农机手。
    2月6日和7日，共有1500名苏联官兵回到铁尔梅兹。上百名苏联和外国记者前来这里采访。
    在苏军士兵撤回到阿姆河畔的同时，苏联部队还从另一条路线撤回到土库曼共和国库什基地区。有些部队回国后很快将被解散。
