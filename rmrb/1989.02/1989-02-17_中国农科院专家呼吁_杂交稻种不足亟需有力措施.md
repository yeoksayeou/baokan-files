	In recent years, the development of hybrid rice has been rapid. In 1988, the nationwide planting area reached 1.9 billion mu, making a significant contribution to grain production. However, due to frequent natural disasters such as droughts and floods, the production of hybrid rice seeds has been seriously affected, with a large reduction in output, leading to a supply-demand gap. Experts from the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences suggest that timely and effective measures should be taken to alleviate the supply-demand contradiction of hybrid rice seeds.

	They believe that the following work should be carried out immediately:

	Investigate the surplus and shortage of hybrid rice seeds, and organize and plan the adjustment of surplus and shortage to ensure effective use of seeds. During the adjustment process, information should be shared, mutual support should be provided, and cooperation should be strengthened.

	Strengthen the management of hybrid rice seeds, implement planned procurement and supply. Currently, some places have chaotic hybrid rice seed markets, and it is more necessary to strengthen the supervision and management of seed quality in the market to ensure seed quality. Those who hoard, speculate, inflate seed prices, or sell fake and inferior seeds should be severely dealt with once discovered.

	Expand the breeding and seed production area of hybrid rice in the south, and do a good job in various management work. It is understood that this year's hybrid rice seed production area in the south is nearly 130,000 mu, and every effort must be made to strengthen field management to produce as many seeds as possible.

	Make good use of old seeds. Some places still have some unused seeds from last year, which can be reused. However, it should be noted that due to different storage conditions, the germination ability of old seeds will vary, so the germination rate should be determined, and the amount of seeds used should be calculated based on the germination rate. On this basis, do a good job in seed processing, timely soaking and sowing, applying sufficient base fertilizer, and strengthening seedling management to achieve good results.

	Promote effective seed-saving cultivation technologies. To improve seed utilization, seeds can be saved from the seedling raising method. For example, using film-covered seedling raising, factory seedling raising, combined with sparse and even sowing, timely early sowing, paying attention to fertilization and irrigation, and preventing seedling rot, can cultivate more tillers and robust seedlings, achieving the goal of saving seeds.

　　中国农科院专家呼吁    
    杂交稻种不足亟需有力措施
    本报讯  记者何黄彪报道：近年来，杂交水稻发展很快，１９８８年全国种植面积达１．９亿亩，为粮食生产作出了重大贡献。但是，由于旱涝等自然灾害频繁，杂交稻的制种受到严重影响，减产幅度较大，供需出现缺口。中国农业科学院的专家建议：应该抓紧时机，采取有力措施，缓解杂交稻种供求矛盾。
    他们认为目前应着手进行这样几项工作：
    摸清杂交稻种余缺数量，有组织有计划地做好余缺调剂，使种子得到有效利用。在调剂过程中，还要互通信息，相互支持，发扬风格，通力协作。
    加强杂交稻种管理，实行计划收购、计划供应。目前，有的地方杂交稻种子市场混乱，更需要加强市场种子质量监督和管理，保证种子质量。对那些套购抢购、哄抬种价、销售假劣种子的，一经发现要严肃处理。
    扩大南方杂交稻繁殖制种面积，抓紧搞好各项管理工作。据了解，今年杂交稻南繁制种面积近１３万亩，必须千方百计加强田间管理，尽可能多收一些种子。
    用好陈种。有些地方还有一些去年未用完的种子，完全可以再利用。但必须注意，因陈种保藏条件不同，发芽能力会有一些变化，所以要测定其发芽能力，按发芽率高低，计算出用种量。在此基础上，搞好种子处理，适时浸种播种，施足底肥，加强秧田管理，同样也会获得好的收成。
    推广行之有效的节约用种栽培技术。为了提高种子利用率，可从育秧方法上节约用种。如采用地膜育秧，工厂化育秧，再加上稀播匀播、适时早播、讲究施肥浇水、防止烂秧等配套栽培技术，就可以培育出多蘖壮秧，达到节省用种之目的。
