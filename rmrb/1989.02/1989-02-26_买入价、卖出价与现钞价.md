Buying Rate, Selling Rate, and Cash Rate

Q: In foreign exchange trading, what do buying rate, selling rate, and cash rate represent?

A: Buying rate, selling rate, and cash rate are terms used to indicate foreign exchange rates from the perspective of a bank buying or selling foreign exchange or foreign currency cash.

The buying rate, also known as the buying exchange rate, is the rate at which a bank buys foreign exchange from other banks or customers. The selling rate, also known as the selling exchange rate, is the rate at which a bank sells foreign exchange to other banks or customers. Assuming the use of direct quotation, where the foreign currency is converted into the domestic currency, the exchange rate that results in a smaller amount of domestic currency is the buying rate, and the exchange rate that results in a larger amount of domestic currency is the selling rate. The State Administration of Foreign Exchange in China publishes the exchange rates of the Renminbi using the direct quotation method. For example, on February 20, 1989, the buying rate for 100 US dollars was 371.27 yuan, indicating the amount of Renminbi the Bank of China would pay to purchase 100 US dollars from domestic customers. The selling rate for 100 US dollars was 373.14 yuan, indicating the amount of Renminbi the Bank of China would receive from domestic customers for selling 100 US dollars.

The average of the buying rate and selling rate is called the mid-rate, calculated as follows:

Mid-rate = (Buying rate + Selling rate) / 2

In Western countries, the mid-rate is often used for analyzing exchange rates or reporting exchange rate levels in the media. Chinese newspapers and radio stations also use the mid-rate when reporting foreign exchange market conditions in the West. The mid-rate for the Renminbi exchange rate is used only for settlement and non-trade-related expenses and is not publicly disclosed.

Q: Please explain the cash rate. Why is the cash buying rate lower than the foreign exchange buying rate?

A: The cash rate, also known as the cash exchange rate, is the rate at which a bank buys or sells foreign currency cash. In theory, the exchange rate for buying and selling cash should be the same as the foreign exchange rate. However, foreign currency cash cannot be circulated outside the country of issue and must be transported to the issuing country. This involves transportation and insurance costs, which must be deducted from the exchange rate. Therefore, the price at which a bank buys foreign currency cash (the cash buying rate) is lower than the foreign exchange buying rate, while the cash selling rate is the same as the foreign exchange selling rate. For example, on December 31, 1988, the cash buying rate for 100 US dollars was 361.99 yuan, lower than the foreign exchange buying rate of 371.27 yuan on the same day. However, the cash selling rate for 100 US dollars was the same as the foreign exchange selling rate, both at 373.14 yuan.

### 买入价、卖出价与现钞价

　　买入价、卖出价与现钞价
    问：在外汇交易中，买入价、卖出价、现钞价各表示什么？
    答：买入价、卖出价以及现钞价是从银行买卖外汇或外币现钞的角度出发，表示外汇行情的术语。
    买入价亦称买入汇率，是指银行向同业或客户买进外汇时使用的汇率；卖出价亦称卖出汇率，指银行向同业或客户卖出外汇时使用的汇率。假设采取用外币折算本币即用直接标价法，外币折合本币数较少的那个汇率是买入价，外币折合本币数较多的那个汇率是卖出价。我国外汇管理局公布的人民币外汇牌价采用的就是直接标价法。例如１９８９年２月２０日人民币兑美元的买入价为：１００美元＝３７１．２７元，这表示中国银行向国内客户购买１００美元付出的人民币价格；卖出价为：１００美元＝３７３．１４元，这表示中国银行向国内客户卖出１００美元收取的人民币价格。
    买入价与卖出价的平均值称作中间价，其计算公式为：
    中间价＝（买入价＋卖出价）÷２
    在西方各国，对汇率进行分析或新闻媒介报道汇价水平时常用中间价。我国报纸电台在报道西方外汇市场行情时亦采用中间价。至于人民币外汇牌价的中间价只用于清算和非贸易从属费用的结算，不对外公布。
    问：请谈谈现钞价，为什么买入现钞价比外汇买入价低？
    答：现钞价又称现钞汇率，是银行买卖外币现钞时使用的汇率，它亦有现钞买入价与现钞卖出价之分。按理买卖现钞的兑换率与外汇汇率应该相同，但外币现钞不能在其发行国国境以外流通，必须将现钞运送到各发行国。这样，由于运送外币现钞要花一定的运费和保险费，需从汇率中扣除。因此，银行在收兑外币现钞时的价格（即买入现钞价）要低于现汇买入价，卖出现钞价与现汇卖出价相同。例如１９８８年１２月３１日，买入美元现钞价为１００美元＝３６１．９９元，低于同日３７１．２７元的现汇买入价，但卖出美元现钞价与美元现汇卖出价一样，均为３７３．１４元。　　　　　　　　　　　施倞
