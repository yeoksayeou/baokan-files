The Forestry Department Sounds the Alarm to Prevent Deforestation from Resurging

	People's Daily reports: Correspondent Gao Baosheng reports: The period from after the Spring Festival until the start of the spring planting season is traditionally a high-incidence time for cases of illegal logging. To prevent the resurgence of large-scale deforestation, the Forestry Department recently issued a notice, requiring various regions to seriously study and adopt effective measures, strengthen the rectification and management of forest areas, and prevent problems before they occur.

	In recent years, many places, especially collective forest areas in the south, have seen the resurgence of illegal logging, and the situation has been worsening. Some places have even seen organized deforestation. According to incomplete statistics from 10 provinces and autonomous regions in the south, as well as Shaanxi and Gansu provinces, there were over 25,000 cases of illegal logging in the first half of last year, with economic and ecological losses that are difficult to quantify.

	Facing the threat of deforestation, the central government and local authorities have taken some measures to stop it, especially since the second half of last year, when relevant central leaders personally issued instructions to supervise the investigation and handling of deforestation cases, achieving noticeable results and temporarily curbing illegal logging. However, since some fundamental problems remain unsolved, the hidden dangers have not been eliminated, and deforestation could resurge this spring.

	The Forestry Department's notice points out that stopping illegal logging is an important part of rectifying economic order, and all levels of government and relevant departments should pay high attention to it. Past deforestation cases should be thoroughly investigated and handled within the first quarter of this year, especially those involving leaders at various levels, which must be investigated to the end. According to the central government's spirit, county-level governments should quickly implement the responsibility system for protecting and developing forest resources during the term of office, and include stopping illegal logging as a key component.

　　林业部敲响警钟  防止毁林风再起
    本报讯  记者高保生报道：春节过后直到春耕大忙之前，历来是乱砍滥伐森林案件的高发季节。为了防止大规模毁林歪风再次抬头，林业部最近发出通知，要求各地认真研究和采取有效措施，加强林区整顿和治理，防患于未然。
    近年来，许多地方，特别是南方集体林区，乱砍滥伐歪风时有抬头，而且愈演愈烈。有的地方甚至出现了有组织的毁林。据南方１０省区及陕、甘两省的不完全统计，去年上半年共发生乱砍滥伐森林案件２．５万多起，经济和生态损失难于计数。
    面对毁林歪风，中央和各地虽然采取了一些制止措施，特别是去年下半年以来，中央有关领导亲自批示督促查办毁林案件，取得了明显效果，乱砍滥伐森林一度有所收敛。但由于一些问题未从根本上解决，隐患仍未消除，毁林歪风有可能在今春再次抬头。
    林业部的通知指出，制止乱砍滥伐，是整顿经济秩序的重要内容，各级政府和有关部门应引起高度重视。对于过去的毁林案件，要在清理的基础上抓紧处理，今年一季度内处理完毕，尤其对涉及各级领导干部的案件，更要一查到底。根据中央精神，县级政府要把领导干部保护、发展森林资源任期目标责任制尽快落到实处，把制止乱砍滥伐作为其中一项重要内容。
