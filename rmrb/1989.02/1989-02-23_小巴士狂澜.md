	The Small Bus Turmoil

		The Rush

	“Hurry up and buy a car! A ‘small bus’ can earn 300 yuan a day, that’s 8,000 to 10,000 yuan a month!”
	Last summer, many individual entrepreneurs in Shenyang rushed to operate “small buses” (mini public buses). By the end of April, the city had only a few dozen small buses, but by early September, the number had surged to 1,194 according to the traffic bureau's statistics, exceeding the number of large public buses that Shenyang had developed over several decades. These small buses, which had no designated routes, were almost all concentrated on busy routes with many passengers, competing with large public buses for stops, routes, and passengers. Many small buses charged excessive fares. Some even boldly blocked the starting points of public buses, preventing them from departing.

	The rapid increase in small buses led to a shortage of drivers. The high income attracted 64 drivers from the bus company to work for individual bus owners, and another 300 applied to transfer. The bus company, which had implemented individual vehicle contracts, saw a decline in employee income in July, August, and September, leading to a restless atmosphere and a sharp increase in absenteeism and job abandonment. At this time, Shenyang also faced an outbreak of conjunctivitis, with over 1,200 bus drivers and attendants falling ill and taking leave, causing many large public buses to stop running. Additionally, major road construction at the railway station disrupted 22 routes.

	For a while, passengers cursed the bus company, the small buses, the mayor, and even the reforms: “The more we reform, the worse it gets, and now there are no buses left.” In contrast, many small bus owners were gleeful, making money in the chaos.

		To Block or to Relieve?

	“Should the city develop small buses?”

	“Should public services be operated by individuals?”

	Opinions were divided, with both praise and criticism. Bus company employees even threatened to strike, demanding the ban of “small buses.”

	The municipal party committee, government, and relevant departments held several meetings to discuss the “small bus” issue. The consensus was that small buses filled the gap in Shenyang’s public transportation by providing small vehicles, achieving a combination of large, small, and taxis, and meeting the diverse needs of passengers at different levels. Currently, Shenyang’s urban construction funds are insufficient, allowing individual operation of small buses to help quickly solve the problem of urban transportation difficulties. The current problems are mainly due to the rapid and uncontrolled development.

	The municipal government adopted the traffic bureau's plan, using public bidding and public lottery methods to allocate routes, and adjusting them every six months to ensure equal opportunities and fair competition for all bidders.

	In mid-October, under the supervision of legal departments, 975 vehicles participated in the bidding for 78 routes, with 806 vehicles winning the bid.

		Fair Competition

	On November 1, the reorganized individual small buses began operating. The order of large public buses was restored, especially around the railway station, where road construction was completed, traffic was smooth, and citizens turned their worries into joy.

	However, small bus owners were dissatisfied with the sharp drop in passengers and income.

	The focus of the conflict was profit. The traffic bureau investigated and analyzed: currently, most small buses on the road still have profits far higher than large public buses, which is quite considerable. The problem is that for car owners expecting to make a fortune, such small profits are not satisfying.

	The traffic bureau's stance is clear: unreasonable demands cannot be tolerated, and for a few with genuinely low incomes, adjustments in fares can be considered.

	However, due to blind development, small buses are seriously oversupplied. Some car owners are bound to face the consequences. According to the traffic bureau's calculations, the city's passenger market can only accommodate about 600 small buses, while the actual capacity has far exceeded this. Currently, some car owners who cannot compete are starting to sell or auction their vehicles.

　　小巴士狂澜
    新华社记者  刘欣欣  张非非
    　　　　一哄而起
    “快买车吧！一辆‘小巴士’一天能挣３００块，一月就是万八千！”
    去年仲夏时节，沈阳市的许多个体户狂热地投入了“小巴士”（小公共汽车）运营。４月末全市还只有几十辆“小巴士”，而到了９月初，在交通局的统计表上就激增到１１９４辆，超过沈阳市几十年发展起来的大公共电汽车数。这些没有指定线路的小巴士，几乎都集中在乘客多的热线上，同大公共电汽车抢站点、抢线路、抢乘客。不少小巴士乱收费，要高价。更有大胆者，干脆堵在公共电汽车始发站口，不让发车。
    激增的小巴士造成司机紧缺。高收入的诱惑使汽车公司６４名司机受雇于个体车主，还有３００多人在申请调离。已实行单车承包的电汽车公司，在小巴士的冲击下，７、８、９三个月，职工收入逐月下降，人心浮动，缺勤掉岗现象猛增。这时，沈阳市偏又遇上红眼病流行，１２００多电汽车司乘人员染疾休假，许多大公共电汽车停运。加上火车站前大规模修路，２２条线路中断。
    一时间，乘客们骂电汽车公司、骂小巴士、骂市长，甚至骂改革：“越改越完蛋，把车都改没了。”相反，许多小巴士车主却幸灾乐祸，乱中发财。
    　　　　堵还是疏？
    “城市要不要发展小巴士？”
    “公益事业应不应该让个人经营？”
    一时众说纷纭、褒贬不一。电车公司职工竟声称要罢工，要求取缔“小巴士”。
    市委、市政府及有关部门几次召开会议，讨论“小巴士”问题，得出的意见是：小巴士填补了沈阳公共交通没有小客车的空白，实现了大客、小客和出租车相结合的车辆结构，有利于满足乘客出行高、中、低档不同层次的需要。目前，沈阳城市建设资金不足，允许个体经营小巴士，有利于加快解决城市乘车难。当前存在的问题，主要是由于发展过快、过猛，管理失控造成的。
    市政府采纳了交通局的方案，采取公开招标、当众摇号的办法分配线路，并且半年一调换，从而使所有投标的车主机遇均等，公平竞争。
    １０月中旬，在法律部门的公证下，９７５辆车参加了７８条线路的招标，８０６台车中标。
    　　　　平等竞争
    １１月１日，整顿后的个体小巴士开始上线运营。大公共电汽车秩序恢复正常，特别是火车站附近，道路改造完毕，交通顺畅，市民们转忧为喜。
    然而，小巴车主对小巴士的乘客急骤下降，收入锐减，大为不满。
    矛盾的焦点是利润。市交通局调查分析：现在大多数上线的小巴士利润仍远远高于大公共电汽车，这是很可观的了。问题是对期望发大财的车主们，这样的小钱显然不合胃口。
    交通局态度明朗：对不合理要求决不能宽容，对于少数确实收入过低的，可以考虑适当调整收费。
    但是，由于盲目发展，小巴士严重过剩，一些车主自食苦果已在所难免。据交通局测算，全市客运市场只能容纳６００辆左右小巴士，而实际运力已远远超出。目前，一些无力竞争的车主已开始转卖或拍卖车辆。
