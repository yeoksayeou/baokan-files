The former Party Secretary of Huating Township, Yishang County, Jiangxi Province, Zhan Yongxiu, abused his power to extort and blackmail, accepting bribes and embezzling public funds totaling 3,189 yuan while arranging and transferring jobs for others. The Shangrao Regional Discipline Inspection Commission of the Chinese Communist Party recently decided to expel Zhan Yongxiu from the Party, demote his salary by one level, and require him to return all the bribes and embezzled funds, which will be handed over to the finance department. The decision will be communicated throughout the Shangrao region.

Zhan Yongxiu's methods of accepting bribes were particularly despicable. He would threaten or entice people to give him money or gifts if they wanted him to solve their problems. One worker who wanted to find a job was told by Zhan, "Alright, leave your watch here, come back next Sunday." Thus, every few days, the worker would send him cigarettes, alcohol, and nutritional supplements. Zhan also used the pretext of eating and drinking to hint at receiving money and gifts. He often said at the dinner table to those who had requests, "I lack this, I lack that," hinting at gifts. The cadres and workers of Huating Township said, "Without giving gifts, nothing can be done in front of Zhan Yongxiu." One worker, in order to find a job for his child, sent Zhan high-quality cigarettes and alcohol dozens of times, and he himself could not remember the exact number. Zhan often used the excuse of "studying the matter" to deliberately delay the process, forcing people to send money and gifts. An out-of-town worker, in order to be transferred to Huating Township for work to be with his spouse, first sent Zhan two sets of cigarettes and alcohol worth over 90 yuan. Zhan still said he needed to "study the matter." With no other choice, the worker had to borrow 200 yuan in cash to give to him, and only then was the problem solved. A farmer who wanted to work in a township enterprise was also delayed repeatedly by Zhan, who refused to solve the problem. The farmer had no choice but to painfully hand over 1,000 yuan from selling his house, and as a result, he quickly got into the factory.

Zhan Yongxiu's methods were despicable, and his conduct was corrupt, seriously losing the basic qualifications and morality of a Communist Party member. After his expulsion from the Party, the cadres and masses of Huating Township could not help but feel relieved.

　　利用职权敲诈勒索
    弋阳花亭乡原党委书记占永修被开除出党
    本报讯  江西省弋阳县花亭乡原党委书记占永修，利用职权，乘安排调动他人工作之机，收受贿赂和侵占公款共３１８９元。中共上饶地区纪委最近决定，开除占永修党籍，降一级工资，并责成其退赔受贿、侵占的全部款项，上交财政，并通报上饶全地区。
    占永修收受贿赂的手段十分恶劣。谁要找他解决问题，就威诱他送钱物。一职工要求解决工作，占永修说：“好吧，你先把手表放在这里，礼拜天来。”于是，每隔几天就给占永修送烟、酒和营养补品。占永修还以吃点喝点为掩护，暗示他人送钱送物，占永修经常在餐桌上对有求于他的人说缺这少那暗示送礼。花亭乡的干部和工人说：“在占永修面前，不送东西是办不成事的。”有一职工为了要给子女找一工作，先后给占永修送高档烟、酒达几十次之多，其数量连他本人也记不清楚了。占永修还经常以“研究研究”为借口，故意拖延不办，迫使他人送钱送物。一外地工人为照顾夫妻关系，要求调进花亭乡工作，先送占永修两次价值９０多元的烟、酒，占永修还说要“研究研究”，不得已，他只好向别人借２００元现金送给他，才解决了问题。一农民想进乡办企业工作，占永修也是一拖再拖，不予解决，这个农民只好忍痛把卖房子的１０００元钱送给他，结果很快就进了厂。
    占永修手段恶劣，作风败坏，严重丧失了共产党员的起码条件和品德。开除他的党籍之后，花亭乡干部群众无不庆幸。
