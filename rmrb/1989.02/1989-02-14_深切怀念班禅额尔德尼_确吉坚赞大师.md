On January 9, 1989, Panchen Erdeni Choekyi Gyaltsen left Beijing for the Tashilhunpo Monastery in Shigatse, Tibet, to preside over the opening ceremony of the joint burial stupa for the fifth to ninth Panchen Lamas. I went to the airport to see him off, just as I usually did. Little did I expect that this would be our final farewell. On January 28, the news of his sudden passing reached us, leaving us deeply sorrowful. Over the more than thirty years we worked together, the deep bond of friendship we shared is truly unforgettable. The sound of his voice and his appearance are still vivid in my memory, as is his lifelong dedication to the country and the people. I write this article to express my profound remembrance.

I

The Tenth Panchen Erdeni, known by his secular name Gonpo Tenzin, was born on the third day of the first lunar month in the Year of the Earth Tiger (1938) in a farming household in Wendu Township, Xunhua County, Qinghai Province. His grandfather was Gongba Gendun and his mother was Sonam Drolma. In 1941, the Tashilhunpo Monastery's assembly hall identified Gonpo Tenzin as the reincarnation of the Ninth Panchen Lama, giving him the religious name Panchen Erdeni Losang Chokyi Gyaltsen. In June 1949, the National Government of the Republic of China officially approved him as the Tenth Panchen Erdeni. On August 10 of the same year, he was enthroned at Kumbum Monastery. According to Tibetan Buddhist rituals, the search for the reincarnation of the Panchen Lama is the responsibility of the Tashilhunpo Monastery. Since 1713, when the Qing Emperor Kangxi conferred the title of "Panchen Erdeni" on the Fifth Panchen Lama, each successive Panchen Lama's reincarnation has also required approval from the central government, making this a long-standing practice. Therefore, the local government of Tibet, the Kashag, only assisted the Tashilhunpo Monastery in finding the reincarnation of the Panchen Lama. The Sixth Panchen Lama Padma Yishin and the Seventh Panchen Lama Danba Nimah were approved by the Qianlong Emperor; the Eighth Panchen Lama Danba Wangchug was approved by the Xianfeng Emperor after a golden urn drawing; and the Ninth Panchen Lama Chokyi Nyima was also approved by the Guangxu Emperor after a golden urn drawing. Due to a falling out with the Thirteenth Dalai Lama, the Ninth Panchen Erdeni left Tibet for the interior in November 1923 and passed away on December 1, 1937, in Yushu, Qinghai. The Kashag government refused to acknowledge the Tenth Panchen Lama identified by the Tashilhunpo Monastery's assembly hall and instead found another reincarnation to be installed in Lhasa.

In February 1951, at the behest of the Fourteenth Dalai Lama, I led a delegation from the Tibetan local government to Beijing to discuss the peaceful liberation of Tibet with representatives of the Central People's Government. After arriving in Beijing in April, Panchen Erdeni also arrived in the city. I sent a telegram to the Dalai Lama, who was then in Yadong, Tibet, suggesting that the Tibetan local government acknowledge the Tenth Panchen Erdeni, who had been identified by the assembly hall and officially approved by the National Government of the Republic of China. At that time, representatives from the Tashilhunpo Monastery also went to Yadong to meet with the Dalai Lama, and my suggestion was adopted. Thus, I, as an official of the Tibetan local government, went to pay my respects to Panchen Erdeni. This was the first time I met Panchen Erdeni. I was the first high-ranking official from the Tibetan local government to meet the Tenth Panchen Lama. I remember that on the day of the May 1st celebration, I stood with Panchen Erdeni on the Tiananmen Gate Tower and received a warm reception from Chairman Mao. We both felt greatly honored. From then on, my friendship and association with Panchen Erdeni began.

During the time of the Thirteenth Dalai Lama and the Ninth Panchen Lama, due to various reasons, there was deep-seated animosity and opposition between them, which had not been resolved before liberation. Fortunately, on October 1, 1949, the People's Republic of China was established, and especially on May 23, 1951, the Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet was signed in Beijing between the Central People's Government and the Tibetan Local Government. The agreement consisted of seventeen articles, with the fifth article stating: "The inherent status and authority of Panchen Erdeni shall be maintained"; and the sixth article stating: "The inherent status and authority of the Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdeni refer to the status and authority when the Thirteenth Dalai Lama and the Ninth Panchen Erdeni were on good terms with each other." The solution provided in the agreement was reasonable and mutually accommodating, setting aside old grievances and uniting on a new basis, fully in line with the wishes of the broad masses of monks and laypeople in Tibet. In April 1952, Panchen Erdeni returned to Tibet and officially assumed his duties as the head of the Tashilhunpo Monastery.

In 1954, the Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdeni jointly attended the First Session of the First National People's Congress in Beijing. I was also a delegate. During this time, Chairman Mao instructed that "to achieve genuine unity within Tibet, we must adopt a spirit of mutual trust, mutual respect, and mutual understanding to thoroughly resolve unresolved issues." The Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdeni, along with all the attendees, unanimously agreed to this spirit. I, along with Gyurme Tsering, represented the Tibetan local government and worked with representatives from the Tashilhunpo Monastery's assembly hall, Jamphel Yeshe and Tenzin Puntsok, to discuss and resolve the relationship between the Kashag and the assembly hall committee. After friendly consultations, both sides reported the discussion to the Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdeni, respectively, and conducted detailed discussions with various levels of monastic and secular officials who had come to Beijing. Finally, they reached the "Agreement on Historical and Pending Issues Negotiated Between the Tibetan Local Government and the Tashilhunpo Monastery Assembly Hall Committee," which was submitted to the State Council (the Seventh State Council Meeting) for approval. Thus, the relationship between the Tibetan local government and the Tashilhunpo Monastery assembly hall committee was finally improved, achieving genuine unity within the Tibetan nationality. In the past, due to the instigation of imperialist invaders and Chinese feudal rulers, there had been long-term division and disunity within the Tibetan nationality. Only under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao did the Tibetan people truly achieve internal unity.

In November 1956, the Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdeni were invited to India to participate in the 2500th anniversary of the Buddha's Parinirvana. At that time, the "Tibet Welfare Association" in India was plotting to have the Dalai Lama stay in India, attempting to achieve "Tibetan independence." The activities of the "Tibet Welfare Association" were frequent. At that time, I explained the situation to Panchen Erdeni through Jamphel Yeshe: these activities were internal matters of the local government and were not directed at Panchen Erdeni, hoping that he would dispel any doubts. During his stay in India, Panchen Erdeni emphasized the traditional friendship between China and India and made contributions to cultural exchanges between the two countries. In 1956, the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region was established, with the Dalai Lama as the Chairman and Panchen Erdeni as the First Vice Chairman, and I as the Secretary-General. Thus, I began to have working connections with Panchen Erdeni. In March 1959, the reactionary ruling clique in the upper echelons of Tibetan society launched an armed rebellion. After the rebellion was suppressed, on March 28, Premier Zhou Enlai issued an order to dissolve the original local government, with the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region assuming the duties of the local government, and Panchen Erdeni was appointed as the Acting Chairman of the Preparatory Committee, while I served as the Vice Chairman and Secretary-General. From then on, our relationship became even closer.

Panchen Erdeni not only cared about the work in Tibet but also deeply sympathized with the sufferings of the people in other Tibetan areas. In 1962, after inspecting Tibet and the Tibetan areas of Sichuan, Qinghai, and Yunnan, he wrote a report titled "General and Specific Situation of Tibet and the Hope and Requirements of the Tibetan People in the Main Tibetan Areas" (commonly known as the "70,000 Character Petition"), seeking my opinion on the draft. After reading the draft, I suggested that it would be better to report orally to the central leadership and that the language should not be too harsh. In May 1962, Panchen Erdeni insisted on submitting the petition to the State Council. Later, he was criticized for this and even had his position revoked. At that time, I proposed to Comrade Zhang Guohua: no matter how serious Panchen Erdeni's problem was, and no matter how severe the criticism needed to be, his position as the Acting Chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region must not be revoked. I also hoped that Comrade Zhang Guohua would report my opinion to the central leadership. At that time, under the influence of the "Left" erroneous guiding ideology, Panchen Erdeni was treated unfairly and incorrectly. Especially during the Cultural Revolution, he was imprisoned. In March 1974, the Speaker of the Kuwaiti National Assembly, Khalid Saleh Al-Ghanim, and his wife, along with their entourage, visited China. On March 10, Premier Zhou Enlai met with Speaker Al-Ghanim and his wife, and I was instructed to accompany them. Before the meeting, Premier Zhou suggested that we should find a way to let Panchen Erdeni resume work. I immediately agreed with the Premier's opinion and expressed my willingness to help Panchen Erdeni pass through the rectification process and resume work as soon as possible. Unfortunately, at that time, the "Gang of Four" was in power, and Premier Zhou's concern and correct intentions could not be realized, and I still feel very regretful about this. After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Party, Panchen Erdeni's leadership position was restored, and we assisted each other and worked together, deepening our friendship and jointly dedicating ourselves to the construction of Tibet.

In early 1988, Panchen Erdeni made his fifth trip to Tibet to prepare for the Great Prayer Festival in Lhasa. Before his departure, we met, and I frankly advised him: no matter what situation you encounter this time, do not get angry. In Tibet, he successfully handled several major issues that needed to be addressed before the Great Prayer Festival, earning the love and respect of the Tibetan religious community and the broad masses of monks and laypeople. When he returned to Beijing, he told me: this time, I followed your advice and remained calm and did not get angry in the face of difficulties. I was very pleased to hear this.

II

Panchen Erdeni lived for 51 years. In more than half a century of life, he experienced two different social systems, witnessing how, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, our great motherland transformed from weakness to strength, and how various nationalities transformed from division and opposition to close unity, achieving national unity and ethnic unity as well as internal unity within ethnic groups. After liberation, he personally participated in the great cause of building our motherland into a powerful new China. Panchen Erdeni dedicated his life to maintaining national unity, promoting unity among all ethnic groups, and advancing the common prosperity and development of all ethnic groups.

Panchen Erdeni's sincere patriotism was based on a deep understanding of the history of our motherland, inheriting and carrying forward the fine tradition of previous Panchen Lamas who maintained national unity and loved the motherland. The achievements of previous Panchen Erdenis in maintaining national unity are well-documented in history. The Fourth Panchen Lama Lozang Chökyi Gyaltsen, along with the Fifth Dalai Lama, led the suppression of internal turmoil in Tibet and sent representatives to actively contact the Qing central government. During the reign of the Fifth Panchen Lama Lozang Yeshe, Tibet was frequently invaded by foreign forces and experienced internal turmoil, but he remained steadfastly on the side of the central government. The Sixth Panchen Lama Padma Yishin, to oppose national separatism and maintain national unity, personally visited Chengde to pay his respects to the Qianlong Emperor in 1780. The Eighth Panchen Lama Danba Wangchug, who died young, was deeply moved by the imperial favor. The Ninth Panchen Lama Chokyi Nyima, along with the Thirteenth Dalai Lama, led the resistance against British aggression and, in his later years, actively participated in the resistance against Japanese aggression, becoming an outstanding anti-imperialist and patriotic religious leader. The Tenth Panchen Erdeni Choekyi Gyaltsen continued and carried forward the patriotic tradition of his predecessors. In my interactions with him, I was deeply impressed by his extensive reading of historical texts and his profound understanding of the history of our motherland, especially his clear and correct understanding of the history of Tibet's relationship with the motherland. Our great motherland was created and developed by people of all ethnic groups. In the long process of historical development, China gradually formed a vast multi-ethnic state. The ancestors of the Mongolian people, Genghis Khan, fought all his life, and his descendants established the Yuan Dynasty. It was also at this time that Tibet formally became part of China's territory and an administrative region under the central government of the Yuan Dynasty. Since then, although the central court changed hands many times, whether it was the Ming Dynasty, the Qing Dynasty, or the Republic of China, they all exercised sovereignty over Tibet. During this period, the local government of Tibet also changed hands several times, but the political subordination relationship between Tibet and the central government was never interrupted. Of course, due to the varying degrees of consolidation of the central government and the fluctuations in national strength, as well as the varying intensity of internal conflicts within Tibet, the relationship between the local government of Tibet and the central government also experienced some ups and downs and abnormal situations. However, from the perspective of the overall history, unity is the inevitable outcome. Although some scholars at home and abroad have different views on these major historical issues, and some people with ulterior motives even deliberately distort them, Panchen Erdeni and I had serious discussions, and our views were completely consistent. Therefore, over the past half-century, Panchen Erdeni has always been clear-cut and firm in his stance on maintaining unity and opposing separatism in the face of major issues of national unity.

On October 1, 1949, the People's Republic of China was established. On the day of the founding, Panchen Erdeni sent a telegram from Qinghai to Chairman Mao Zedong and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De, expressing his heartfelt support for the establishment of New China with great joy: "The righteous army of the People's Liberation Army brings joy to the nation," and "the Central People's Government is established, and all those with blood and breath are united in celebration." Panchen Erdeni saw in the establishment of New China the hope for the happiness of the people and the revival of the nation. At that time, Tibet had not yet been liberated, and Panchen Erdeni eagerly hoped for the early liberation of Tibet.

On May 23, 1951, the Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet was signed in Beijing between the Central People's Government and the Tibetan Local Government. The Agreement clearly stated: "The Tibetan people should unite to drive out the imperialist aggressors from Tibet, and the Tibetan people should return to the great family of the Chinese people," and "the Tibetan local government should actively assist the People's Liberation Army to enter Tibet and strengthen national defense." The Agreement embodied the fundamental spirit of achieving national unity, ethnic unity, and equality, solving the abnormal relationship between Tibet and the central government that had been manufactured by imperialism for nearly half a century. Panchen Erdeni made his own contributions to promoting the signing of the Agreement. He was very happy about the signing of the Agreement. On May 28 of that year, Panchen Erdeni and the Tashilhunpo Monastery's assembly hall issued a statement supporting the "Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet"; the statement said: "The Central People's Government and the Tibetan local government have reached a satisfactory agreement on the issue of the peaceful liberation of Tibet, and the Tibetan people have finally broken free from the shackles of imperialism and returned to the great family of the motherland. All ethnic groups in China are excited about this major event. We are the Tibetan nationality, and therefore we have an indescribable excitement." On October 26, 1951, the People's Liberation Army's troops entering Tibet, led by Commander Zhang Guohua and Political Commissar Tan Guan-san, arrived in Lhasa in victory, achieving the peaceful liberation of Tibet.

On March 10, 1959, the reactionary ruling clique in the upper echelons of Tibetan society openly tore up the Seventeen-Point Agreement and launched an armed rebellion. At this critical moment in Tibetan history, Panchen Erdeni firmly opposed the rebellion and resolutely supported democratic reform. Especially during his tenure as the Acting Chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, he worked day and night to suppress the rebellion, implement democratic reform, and contribute to the complete liberation of millions of serfs and the prosperity and development of Tibet.

The victory of suppressing the rebellion and democratic reform laid a solid foundation for thoroughly eliminating separatist forces and eradicating the soil for "Tibetan independence." If the work had been done well, the so-called "Tibetan independence" activities would have had no market. Unfortunately, due to the increasingly severe "Left" erroneous line that followed, especially the ten years of turmoil, objectively, it provided an opportunity for the revival of "Tibetan independence" for separatist forces. Separatist forces rose, and there was internal and external coordination, with some people in Tibet raising the banner of "independence" again. In the past decade, Panchen Erdeni, based on sufficient historical facts, strongly and logically refuted the fallacies of "Tibetan independence," emphasizing the need to be patriotic and strengthen unity among all ethnic groups, especially between the Tibetan and Han nationalities. Panchen Erdeni repeatedly expressed: "My stance on maintaining national unity is unwavering. I oppose separatist actions against the motherland, I opposed them in the past, I oppose them now, and I will oppose them in the future. I am willing to make the greatest sacrifice for the great cause of maintaining national unity."

Since 1980, the Dalai Lama has sent representatives to Beijing several times, and Panchen Erdeni has repeatedly received them, solemnly advising them to abandon the stance of "Tibetan independence." He also directly called the Dalai Lama to explain the greatness of patriotism.

From 1987 to 1988, a few separatists openly incited "Tibetan independence" in Lhasa, causing several disturbances. Panchen Erdeni repeatedly condemned the evil actions of the separatists. His great patriotic image will forever inspire the Tibetan people and the entire Chinese nation.

III

In my long-term association and cooperation with Panchen Erdeni, I often heard him say: "Ethnic cadres should have two conditions: one is to love the country, support the Party's leadership, follow the socialist path, and maintain national unity; the other is to have feelings for one's own ethnic group, do some things for the interests of the ethnic group, and be seen as one of the people by the masses." He organically unified loving the motherland with loving the Tibetan people, maintaining national unity with maintaining the various interests of the people of the ethnic group, on the basis of following the Party's socialist path. He wholeheartedly supported and took the lead in implementing the central government's wise decisions and major policies on the work in Tibetan areas; for the shortcomings and errors in the work that violated the interests of the masses and hindered the development and progress of ethnic groups, he spoke out and took active measures to rectify them.

"The reform of various matters related to Tibet will not be forced by the central government," this was determined in the "Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet." However, due to the reactionary ruling clique in the upper echelons of Tibetan society tearing up the Seventeen-Point Agreement on March 10, 1959, and launching an armed rebellion, in order to maintain national unity and protect the interests of the broad masses of Tibetan people, the central government had to decide to suppress the rebellion and implement democratic reform, abolishing the feudal serf system. In this historical transformation of Tibetan society, great achievements were made, but some leftist tendencies also emerged. In 1961, Panchen Erdeni, I, and several other comrades came to Beijing to participate in the National Day celebration activities and then visited various places. Panchen Erdeni went to the south and Xinjiang, Qinghai, and other places, where he learned about some problems in the work there. Later, when we all gathered in Chengdu, as soon as we met, Panchen Erdeni angrily told me: there are many problems in the work in Qinghai, I will report to Secretary Li Pingyuan and write a report to the central government, which is the report I mentioned earlier, the "70,000 Character Petition." In May 1962, he submitted this "70,000 Character Petition" to Premier Zhou Enlai. After reading it, Premier Zhou summoned us and said that the problems raised in the report were important, and you should not go back yet and should study the rectification opinions. He also summoned several other comrades from Tibet to study together. This work was presided over by Comrade Li Weihan, the then Minister of the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee. In addition to Panchen Erdeni and me, the participants in the discussion included Tibetan leaders Zhang Jingwu, Zhang Guohua, Wang Qimei, Xia Furen, and Pabala, as well as Deputy Ministers of the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee, Ping Jiesan and Liu Chun. The work lasted for more than a month, resulting in four important documents: "Strengthening the Work of the Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region and Improving the Relationship of Cooperation," "Several Regulations on Continuing to Implement the Policy of Freedom of Religious Belief," "Opinions on Continuing to Implement the Regulations on Handling Counterrevolutionaries," and "Cultivating and Educating Cadres." These documents were formulated in response to the problems raised in the "70,000 Character Petition," with the basic spirit of further implementing the Party's policies on ethnic minorities and religion, correcting the expansion of the suppression of the rebellion, and strengthening the cultivation and education of ethnic cadres. For example, the documents clearly stated: "Under the leadership of the Party, we should further clarify the division of labor between the Party and the government and strengthen government work." "The documents of the Preparatory Committee and the Special District (including subordinate business departments) must use two languages, and gradually achieve the use of Tibetan and Han languages in the documents of all levels of government and business departments." "The requirements and standards for temples and religious professionals: love the country, abide by the law, and follow the socialist path. Do not set overly high requirements." "Carefully and steadily continue to do a good job of screening and clearing the current detainees," "cases that are clearly wrongly arrested or wrongly judged should be completely rectified, and the deceased should have their names restored." "Regardless of whether they are Tibetan, Han, upper-middle-class patriots, patriotic intellectuals, or cadres of laborer origin, they should all adopt the policy of cultivation and education," "gradually create conditions for the responsible positions at all levels of government to be gradually taken by Tibetan cadres," and so on.

Undoubtedly, these four documents are very correct. Panchen Erdeni and we all returned to Tibet with joyful hearts. When passing through Lihua, Comrade Xia Furen humorously said, "The formulation of the four documents did not involve bloodshed, but it did involve a lot of sweat." Everyone hoped that the four documents would be seriously implemented, and the leftist tendencies would be corrected as soon as possible, so that the work in Tibet could take a big step forward on a new basis. As soon as we arrived in Lhasa, we established four groups to start implementing the documents. Panchen Erdeni was responsible for the group implementing the religious policy, and I was responsible for the group correcting the expansion of the suppression of the rebellion. Unfortunately, our work had just begun when the situation changed dramatically, and the domestic situation underwent a huge change. The warning "never forget class struggle" spread throughout the country, and the "70,000 Character Petition" was considered an "attack by the serf owners on us." The implementation of the four documents was forced to stop. After that, Panchen Erdeni was also treated very unfairly.

Although Panchen Erdeni suffered such great injustice, he did not change his original intention of loving the country and the people. After resuming work, he repeatedly said: "Compared to the persecution suffered by the older generation of revolutionaries, this little injustice is nothing!" "All this has become the past, and the Party Central Committee has given me a complete rehabilitation, allowing me to have a second political life and the opportunity to serve the people of all ethnic groups in the country and the Tibetan people." "I sincerely hope that everyone will put aside past grievances, unite and look forward, understand and encourage each other, help and support each other, unite as one, and work together for the Four Modernizations." In the past decade, to do a good job, Panchen Erdeni almost traveled throughout the vast country and the entire Tibetan area, with great enthusiasm promoting the Party's policies and guidelines for work in Tibetan areas, caring for the construction of various undertakings and the production and life of the people in Tibetan areas, and contributing to the implementation of the Party's ethnic and religious policies and promoting the prosperity and progress of Tibetan areas. He paid great attention to the implementation of regional ethnic autonomy, often emphasizing the need to "fully and correctly exercise ethnic regional autonomy according to the Constitution and laws"; he paid great attention to ethnic unity, emphasizing the need to "strengthen the unity between the Tibetan and Han nationalities, the Tibetan and other ethnic minorities, and within the Tibetan nationality," "do not divide into U-Tsang, Kham, and Amdo, but unite"; he paid great attention to the prosperity and progress of Tibetan Buddhism, protecting the legal rights and interests of temples and monks and nuns, and devoted himself to the pilot work of temple management under socialist conditions, gaining valuable experience. Panchen Erdeni particularly emphasized the learning, use, and development of the Tibetan language, repeatedly saying, "primary schools should mainly teach ethnic languages, middle schools can teach both ethnic languages and Chinese," "suggest establishing a Tibetan university," "recruitment of workers and students should test ethnic languages," "if an ethnic cadre cannot even speak their own ethnic language, how can they exercise autonomy by speaking policy and politics in their own ethnic language!" In 1987, I wanted to use the opportunity of the Tibet People's Congress to promote the use and learning of the Tibetan language in Tibet and strive to produce a legal document. But I was in a hurry and did not have time to discuss this matter with the central leaders before leaving Beijing for Tibet, so I entrusted Panchen Erdeni, who left Beijing for Tibet later than me, to talk to the central leaders first. Panchen Erdeni then detailed our thoughts to central leaders such as Peng Zhen and Hu Qili, and after arriving in Tibet, we closely cooperated and did a lot of ideological work. Finally, the meeting passed the "Several Provisions on the Learning, Use, and Development of the Tibetan Language" (trial). Currently, this provision is being gradually implemented.

Comrade Deng Xiaoping said, Panchen Erdeni is "one of the best patriots in our country." He left us, but his spirit of maintaining national unity and strengthening ethnic unity, his noble character of loving the Tibetan people and caring for the people's sufferings, and his excellent style of deep investigation and research have been left to us. We should learn from, inherit, and carry forward his spirit. Panchen Erdeni's spirit will live forever!

　　深切怀念班禅额尔德尼·确吉坚赞大师
    阿沛·阿旺晋美
    １９８９年元月９日，班禅额尔德尼·确吉坚赞大师离开北京前往西藏日喀则扎什伦布寺主持第五世至第九世班禅遗体合葬灵塔祀殿班禅东陵扎什南捷开光典礼。我还像往常一样前往机场送行。万万没有想到这竟是与大师的诀别。元月２８日大师遽然圆寂，噩耗传来不胜悲恸。与大师共事三十多年的友好情谊实难忘怀；大师的音容謦欬宛然如在；大师一生爱国爱民的风范历历在目。特草此文，聊表深深的怀念之情。
    　　　　一
    十世班禅额尔德尼俗名为贡布慈丹，１９３８年藏历土虎年正月初三诞生于青海省循化县温都乡一农户，封翁古公才旦，尊堂索南卓玛。１９４１年班禅行辕堪布会议厅认定贡布慈丹为九世班禅的转世灵童，取法名为班禅额尔德尼·洛桑赤列伦珠确吉坚赞，１９４９年６月经中华民国政府正式批准继任第十世班禅额尔德尼，同年８月１０日在塔尔寺举行坐床典礼。按照藏传佛教的仪轨，班禅系转世灵童的寻访由扎什伦布寺负责。自从１７１３年清康熙皇帝册封五世班禅为“班禅额尔德尼”之后，历世班禅转世还要经中央政府册封，这已成为定制。因此，西藏地方政府——噶厦只是协助扎什伦布寺寻找班禅转世灵童。六世班禅巴丹益喜、七世班禅丹白尼玛是经乾隆皇帝批准；八世班禅丹白旺秋是经金瓶掣签，由清咸丰皇帝批准；九世班禅曲吉尼玛也是经过金瓶掣签，由清光绪皇帝批准的。九世班禅额尔德尼由于与十三世达赖喇嘛失和，１９２３年１１月离开西藏到内地，１９３７年１２月１日圆寂于青海玉树。噶厦政府不肯承认班禅堪布会议厅认定的十世班禅，并且另找了一个转世灵童迎请到拉萨供奉。
    １９５１年２月，我受十四世达赖喇嘛之命率西藏地方政府代表团前来北京与中央人民政府代表团协商和平解放西藏的事宜。我们于４月到达北京之后，班禅大师也到了北京。我向当时在西藏亚东的达赖喇嘛去电请示，建议西藏地方政府承认堪布会议厅认定、并由中华民国政府正式批准的十世班禅额尔德尼·确吉坚赞。这时扎什伦布寺的代表也前往亚东拜见达赖喇嘛，我的建议得到采纳。于是，我就以西藏地方政府官员的身份前去拜会班禅大师。这是我第一次见到班禅大师。我是西藏地方政府高级官员中第一个接触十世班禅的人。记得在那年“五一”节那天，我和班禅大师在天安门城楼上共同受到毛主席的亲切接见，我们都感到十分荣幸。从此，开始了我和班禅大师的交往和友谊。
    十三世达赖喇嘛与九世班禅时期，由于种种原因，产生了仇视和对立，积怨很深，解放以前始终未能言归于好。庆幸的是，１９４９年１０月１日中华人民共和国成立，特别是１９５１年５月２３日在北京签订了中央人民政府和西藏地方政府关于和平解放西藏办法的协议。协议共十七条，其中第五条写道：“班禅额尔德尼的固有地位及职权，应予维持”；第六条写道：“达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼的固有地位及职权，系指十三世达赖喇嘛与九世班禅额尔德尼彼此和好相处时的地位和职权。”协议规定的解决办法合情合理，互谅互让，弃捐旧恶，在新的基础上重新团结起来，完全符合西藏广大僧俗人民的愿望。１９５２年４月，班禅大师回到西藏，正式行使扎什伦布寺寺主的权力。
    １９５４年达赖喇嘛和班禅大师联袂来京出席全国人民代表大会。我那时也是人大代表。在京期间，毛主席指示“要达到西藏内部的真正团结，必须以互相信任，互相尊重，互相谅解的精神，来彻底处理未解决的问题。”对以上精神，达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼为首的全体人员一致同意。我和柳霞·土登塔巴以西藏地方政府代表的身份与班禅堪布会议厅代表詹东·计晋美、德仑·次仁班觉具体协商处理噶厦与堪布会议厅委员会的关系。经友好协商，双方代表分别向达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼报告了商谈情况，并与来京各级僧俗官员进行了详细的讨论，最后形成了《西藏地方政府和班禅堪布会议厅委员会之间关于历史和悬案问题的谈判达成的协议》，并报请国务院（第七次国务会议）批准。这样，西藏地方政府和班禅堪布会议厅委员会之间的关系最终得到改善，达到了西藏民族内部的真正团结。过去，由于帝国主义侵略势力和中国封建统治者挑拨，造成了西藏民族内部长期的分裂和不和，只有在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，西藏人民才真正实现了内部团结。
    １９５６年１１月，达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼·确吉坚赞应邀前往印度参加释迦牟尼涅槃２５００周年纪念活动。当时在印度的“西藏福利会”阴谋策划达赖喇嘛留居印度，企图搞“西藏独立”。“西藏福利会”的人活动频繁。当时，我通过詹东·计晋美向班禅大师说明了情况：这些活动是地方政府内部的事，不是针对班禅大师的，切望大师消除疑虑。在印度期间，班禅大师强调中印两国的传统友谊，为中印文化交流作出了贡献。１９５６年西藏自治区筹备委员会成立，达赖喇嘛任主任委员，班禅大师任第一副主任委员，我是秘书长。这样，我和班禅大师开始有了工作上的联系。１９５９年３月，西藏上层中的反动统治集团发动武装叛乱，平息叛乱以后，３月２８日周恩来总理发布命令，解散原地方政府，由自治区筹备委员会行使地方政府职权，并任命班禅大师为自治区筹备委员会代理主任委员职务，我任副主任委员兼秘书长。从此，我们之间的关系更加密切了。
    班禅大师不仅关心西藏的工作，而且系念其他藏区人民的疾苦。１９６２年班禅大师在视察了西藏和川、青、滇藏区后，将了解到的情况和问题写了《西藏总的和具体情况以及以西藏为主的藏族地区的苦乐和今后的希望要求的报告》（简称《七万言上书》），曾征求我对这个报告草稿的意见。我看过草稿以后，向他建议最好用口头形式向中央领导汇报，并言辞不要过激。１９６２年５月，班禅大师执意上书国务院。后来他竟因此受到批判，以至撤销了职务。当时我曾向张国华同志提出：班禅大师的问题不论怎么严重，不管需要多么严厉的批判，也千万不能撤销他自治区筹备委员会代理主任委员的职务。并且希望张国华同志把我的意见报告中央。那时正是在“左”的错误指导思想影响下，班禅大师受到了不公正的对待和错误的处理。特别是“文革”期间，他竟身陷囹圄。１９７４年３月，科威特国民议会议长哈立德·萨利赫·古奈姆和夫人及其随行人员来我国访问。３月１０日，周恩来总理会见古奈姆议长和夫人，我奉命作陪。周恩来总理在接见之前曾向我提出应设法让班禅大师出来工作。我听了当即表示非常赞同总理的意见，并表示愿意帮助班禅大师认错过关，尽早出来工作。可惜，当时“四人帮”当道，周总理的关怀和正确的意图未能实现，至今我仍感到十分遗憾。党的十一届三中全会以后，恢复了班禅大师的领导职务，我们互相协助，配合工作，友谊日深，共同为西藏的建设事业尽职。
    １９８８年初，班禅大师第五次进藏为拉萨传召法会作准备。临行前我们相见时，我坦率地劝告他：此次进藏，无论碰到什么情况都不要动气。在西藏，他圆满地处理了传召法会前需要处理的几个重大问题，受到西藏宗教界和广大僧俗人民的爱戴。他从西藏回到北京我们再次相见时，他告诉我：这次我听了您的意见，基本上做到了遇事冷静不动气，我听了非常高兴。

    班禅大师在世５１个春秋。半个多世纪的人生中，他经历了新旧两种社会制度，目睹了在中国共产党的领导下，我们伟大祖国怎样由贫弱转变为强大，各民族由分裂对立转变为亲密团结，实现了国家的统一和民族的团结以及民族内部的团结。解放以后，他亲身投入了把祖国建设成为强大的新中国的伟大事业。班禅大师毕生为之奋斗的正是为了维护祖国统一，增进各族人民的团结，促进各民族的共同繁荣和发展进步。
    班禅大师真挚的爱国之心是建立在对祖国历史有深刻理解的基础之上的，是继承和发扬了历世班禅维护祖国统一、热爱祖国的优良传统。历世班禅额尔德尼一贯维护祖国统一的业绩是史不绝书的。四世班禅罗桑曲结与五世达赖喇嘛一同领导平息了西藏内乱，并派遣代表主动与清朝中央政权联系。五世班禅罗桑益喜在世时，西藏屡遭外族侵扰，内部政局动乱不已，他始终坚定地站在中央政权一边。六世班禅巴丹益喜为反对民族分裂、维护祖国统一，１７８０年亲赴承德拜见乾隆皇帝。八世班禅丹白旺秋，他英年早逝，感铭皇恩。九世班禅曲吉尼玛，曾与十三世达赖喇嘛一起领导了抗英斗争，晚年还积极投身抗日斗争，是一位杰出的反帝爱国的宗教领袖。十世班禅额尔德尼·确吉坚赞大师正是继承和发扬了前数辈班禅额尔德尼一贯爱国的传统。与大师交往中，我感触最深的是他熟读历史典籍，对祖国的历史是那样透彻的了解，尤其是对西藏与祖国关系的历史了解得是那样明晰、正确。伟大祖国是各族人民共同缔造和发展起来的。在漫长的历史发展过程中，中国逐渐形成幅员辽阔的多民族的国家。蒙古族的祖先成吉思汗征战一生，他的后裔建立了大元帝国。也正是这个时候西藏正式归入中国的版图，成为元朝中央政府管辖的一个行政区域。自那以后，虽然中央朝廷多次更迭，但不论是明朝还是清朝以及民国，都对西藏行使了主权。在这个期间，西藏地方政权也几经更替，但是西藏与中央政府的政治隶属关系从未间断。当然，由于中央政权的巩固程度不一，国力盛衰不同；由于西藏地方内部矛盾时烈时缓等因素，西藏地方政权与中央政府的关系也曾出现过一些起落和不正常情况。但是，从历史整体的角度来看，统一是定局。对这些重大的历史问题，尽管国内外的一些学者有不同的说法，甚至别有用心的人还肆意加以歪曲，但是我和班禅大师曾认真交谈过，我们的看法是完全一致的。因此，半个世纪以来，班禅大师在事关祖国统一的大是大非面前总是旗帜鲜明，立场坚定地维护统一、反对分裂，这是很自然的。
    １９４９年１０月１日，中华人民共和国成立。开国当天，班禅大师自青海致电毛泽东主席、朱德总司令，怀着十分喜悦的心情衷心拥护新中国的建立：中国人民解放军“义师所至，全国腾欢”，“中央人民政府成立，凡有血气，同声鼓舞。”大师从新中国的建立看出了“人民之康乐可期，国家之复兴有望”。当时，西藏还未解放，大师急切地盼望西藏早日解放。
    １９５１年５月２３日在北京签订了中央人民政府和西藏地方政府关于和平解放西藏办法的协议。《协议》中明确规定：“西藏人民团结起来，驱逐帝国主义侵略势力出西藏，西藏人民回到中华人民大家庭中来”，“西藏地方政府积极协助人民解放军进入西藏，巩固国防”。《协议》体现了实现祖国统一、民族团结和平等的根本精神，解决了近半个世纪以来由帝国主义制造的西藏地方与祖国中央关系不正常的问题。班禅大师对推动协议的签订作出了自己的贡献。对于协议的签订，班禅大师非常高兴。当年５月２８日，班禅大师和堪布会议厅发表声明，拥护《和平解放西藏办法的协议》；声明中说：“中央人民政府和西藏地方政府关于和平解放西藏问题，已经取得圆满的协议，西藏人民从此摆脱了帝国主义的羁绊，回到了伟大的祖国大家庭。中国各族人民都为这一重大的事件而欢欣鼓舞。我们是西藏民族，因而有着更加难以言喻的兴奋”。１９５１年１０月２６日，中国人民解放军进藏大军在司令员张国华、政委谭冠三同志率领下，胜利到达拉萨，实现了西藏的和平解放。
    １９５９年３月１０日，西藏上层中的反动统治集团公然撕毁十七条协议，悍然发动武装叛乱。在这个西藏历史的关键时刻，班禅大师严正反对叛乱，坚决拥护民主改革。特别是自从他受命担任西藏自治区筹备委员会代理主任委员职务期间，日夜操劳，为平息叛乱、实行民主改革，为百万翻身农奴的彻底解放和西藏的繁荣发展作出了自己的贡献。
    本来平息叛乱、民主改革的胜利为彻底肃清分裂势力、清除“西藏独立”的土壤奠定了坚实的基础。如果工作做好了，所谓“西藏独立”的活动会没有什么市场的。可惜，由于那以后整个“左”的错误路线愈演愈烈，特别是十年动乱，客观上给分裂主义者提供了“西藏独立”死灰复燃的机会。分裂势力抬头，内外呼应，西藏又有人打出了“独立”旗号。近十年来，班禅大师依据充分的历史事实，有力有理地驳斥“西藏独立”的谬论，不论是讲经传法时，还是政务活动中，他都屡屡强调要爱国，要加强各族人民之间、特别是藏汉民族之间的团结。班禅大师多次表示：“我维护祖国统一的立场是坚定不移的。对于分裂祖国的行径，我过去反对，现在反对，将来也反对。我愿为维护祖国统一的伟大事业作出最大牺牲。”
    １９８０年以来，达赖喇嘛多次派代表前来北京，班禅大师一次又一次地接见他们，郑重地劝说他们放弃“西藏独立”的立场。并且直接打电话给达赖喇嘛晓以爱国的大义。
    １９８７年至１９８８年，少数分裂主义者公然在拉萨煽动“西藏独立”，制造了几起骚乱事件。班禅大师多次严厉谴责分裂主义者的这种罪恶行径。他的伟大的爱国主义者的光辉形象必将永远激励着藏族人民和整个中华民族。

    我与班禅大师的长期交往和合作共事中，经常听到他讲过这样的话：“民族干部要具备两个条件：一是爱国，拥护党的领导，走社会主义道路，维护祖国统一；二是对自己的民族有感情，能为本民族的利益办一些事，被群众视为自己人。”他把热爱祖国与热爱藏族人民、维护祖国统一与维护本民族人民群众的各项切身利益，在跟着党走社会主义道路的基础上，有机地统一了起来。对中央关于藏区工作的各项英明决策和大政方针他都是衷心拥护，带头贯彻执行；对工作中出现的一些违背群众利益、妨碍民族发展进步的缺点错误，则直言批评，并积极采取措施促其纠正。
    “有关西藏的各项改革事宜，中央不加强迫”，这是《关于和平解放西藏办法的协议》中确定了的。但是，由于西藏上层中反动统治集团１９５９年３月１０日撕毁了１７条协议，发动了武装叛乱，为了维护祖国统一，保护广大西藏人民的利益，中央不得不决定进行平叛，实行民主改革，废除封建农奴制。在这西藏社会的历史变革中，取得了伟大的成就，同时也产生了一些左倾的现象。１９６１年，班禅大师、我还有其他几个同志来京参加国庆节庆祝活动后，曾分别到外地进行了参观访问。大师去了南方和新疆、青海等地，在青海他又了解到那里工作的一些问题。后来当我们都集中来到成都时，一见面，大师就很生气地对我说：青海的工作中问题很多，我要向李井泉书记汇报，还要向中央写报告，这个报告也就是我前面提到的那份《七万言上书》。１９６２年５月，他把这个《七万言上书》呈送周恩来总理，总理阅后召见我们，说报告中提出的一些问题很重要，你们先不要回去，要研究出纠正的意见。并从西藏召来了其他一些同志共同研究。这项工作由当时的中央统战部部长李维汉同志主持，参加讨论的除班禅大师和我以外，还有西藏的领导同志张经武、张国华、王其梅、夏辅仁、帕巴拉以及中央统战部副部长平杰三、刘春等同志，工作一共进行了一个多月，形成了《加强自治区筹委工作改进合作共事关系》、《关于继续贯彻执行宗教信仰自由政策的几项规定》、《继续贯彻执行处理反叛分子规定的意见》和《培养和教育干部》等４个重要文件。这些文件都是针对《七万言上书》中提出的问题而制定的，基本精神是进一步落实党的民族、宗教政策，纠正平叛扩大化，加强对民族干部的培养和教育。如文件中明确指出：“应当在党的领导下，进一步明确党政分工，加强政府工作”。“筹委和专署（包括所属业务部门）的行文必须使用两种文字，并逐步做到各级政府和业务部门的行文皆使用藏汉两种文字”。“对寺庙和宗教职业者的要求和标准：爱国守法，走社会主义道路。不提过高的要求”。“细致地又稳又准地对现押案犯继续做好甄别清理工作”，“确实属于错捕、错判的案件，应当一律平反，死了的要恢复名誉”。“不论藏族、汉族、中上层爱国人士、爱国知识分子和劳动人民出身的干部，都一律采取培养教育的方针”，“必须逐步创造条件，使各级政府的负责职务逐步由藏族干部担任”，等等。
    毫无疑问，这四个文件是非常正确的。班禅大师和我们都满怀着喜悦的心情返回了西藏。途经里河时，夏辅仁同志风趣地说“制定四个文件虽然没流血，但流了不少汗”。大家都希望４个文件能够得到认真贯彻，左的倾向能够得到尽快纠正，西藏工作在新的基础上能够前进一大步。我们一到拉萨便成立了四个小组，分别着手贯彻。班禅大师负责落实宗教政策的小组，我负责纠正平叛扩大化的小组。不幸的是，我们的工作开始不久，风云突变，国内形势就发生了巨大变化，“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的警告传遍了全国各地，《七万言上书》被认为是“农奴主向我们进攻”。贯彻四个文件的工作被迫中断。此后班禅大师也因此而遭到极不公正的对待。
    班禅大师虽然遭受了那么大的冤屈，但丝毫没有改变他爱祖国爱人民的初衷。他重新工作后多次说过：“与老一辈革命家们所受到的迫害相比，我这点委屈算得了什么！”“这一切已经成为过去，党中央已经给我彻底平反，使我在政治上获得第二次生命，得到了为全国各族人民和藏族人民服务的机会。”“我恳切希望大家捐弃前嫌，团结起来向前看，互相谅解，互相勉励，互相帮助，互相支持，团结一致，并肩携手，共同为四化建设出力。”近十年来，为了作好工作，班禅大师几乎走遍了祖国大江南北和整个藏区，以极大的热情宣传党对藏区工作的方针政策，关怀藏区各项建设事业和人民的生产生活，对落实党的民族政策和宗教政策，对促进藏族地区的繁荣进步作出了贡献。他十分重视民族区域自治的实施，经常强调要“按照宪法和法律充分地正确地行使民族区域自治权”；十分重视民族团结，强调要“加强藏族和汉族、藏族和其他少数民族、藏族内部的团结”，“不要分前藏、后藏、康区、安多，都要团结”；十分重视藏传佛教的昌盛和进步，维护寺庙和僧尼的合法权益，并致力于在社会主义条件下寺庙管理的试点工作，取得了很有价值的经验。班禅大师特别重视藏语文的学习、使用和发展，多次讲“小学主要教民族语文，中学可以本民族语文和汉文同时教”，“建议建立一所藏文大学”，“招工招生要考试本民族语文”，“一个民族干部如果连自己民族的语言也讲不了，不能用本民族语言讲政策、讲政治，怎么能行使自治权！？”１９８７年我想利用西藏召开人代会的机会对在西藏使用、学习藏语文作些促进工作，争取搞出一个法律性文件。但我走得很急，来不及就此事与中央领导同志商议，就委托比我晚离京赴藏的班禅大师先向中央谈一下。班禅大师便向彭真、胡启立等中央领导同志详细谈了我们的想法，赴藏后我们又紧密配合，作了大量的思想工作，最后会议终于通过了《关于学习、使用、发展藏语文的若干规定》（试行）。目前，这一规定正在逐步实施中。
    邓小平同志说，班禅大师是“我们国家一个最好的爱国者”。他离我们而走了，但他的维护祖国统一、增强民族团结的高风亮节，热爱藏族人民、关心人民疾苦的崇高品德和深入下层调查研究的优良作风，留给了我们。我们应当很好地学习、继承和发扬。班禅大师的精神永垂不朽！
