Distressed Students, Dial 4015043
Beijing Establishes a Consultation Hotline for Middle and Primary School Students

Today, the staff of Beijing's consultation hotline for middle and primary school students met with newly elected volunteer operators for the first time. The shared sentiment was, "Let's send our sincere love and heartfelt help to our young friends."

The Beijing Middle and Primary School Student Consultation Hotline, 4015043, was launched on February 5th. Its purpose is to help middle and primary school students resolve their worries and achieve psychological balance, and to provide educators with information on the psychological dynamics of these students. It is understood that from February 5th to 9th, the hotline received 260 recorded inquiries. Among these calls, the largest proportion involved questions about interactions between male and female students, such as "Can students of different genders be friends during school?" The next most common issues were related to parent-child relationships and teacher-student relationships. There were also some inquiries about learning and admission-related questions.

Over 30 operators for the hotline were selected from more than 100 volunteers. Among them are retired and current teachers, cadres, and college students. From their volunteer applications and conversations, it is clear that they are all proud to be able to help young people alleviate their distress in their spare time. At the 4015043 consultation hotline, a young operator emotionally said, "I want to befriend these distressed children with my love and care." During the peak hours from 4 PM to 5 PM, the operators almost had to answer a question from an inquirer every ten seconds.

It is reported that all the staff at this consultation center participate in this social service voluntarily and without compensation.

　　苦闷的孩子请拨４０１５０４３    
    北京设中小学生专线咨询电话
    本报北京２月１４日讯  “把真挚的爱和热心帮助送给青少年朋友”——这是今天下午北京市中小学生专线电话咨询处负责人与新当选的义务接话员首次见面时的共勉。
    北京市中小学生专线电话４０１５０４３，是２月５日开通的，目的在于为中小学生排忧解难、寻求心理平衡，为教育工作者提供中小学生心理动态的信息。据了解，２月５日至９日，已接到２６０多人次有记录的咨询电话。在这些电话中，涉及中学生男女生交往的占比例最大，如“上学期间能否和异性同学交朋友”；其次是涉及亲子关系及师生关系的问题；还有一些提出有关学习及升学的疑问。
    ３０多位专线电话的接话员，是从１００多位自荐者中挑选出来的，其中有离退休和在职教师、干部、大中专学生等。从自荐信和谈话中可以看出，他们都为能在业余时间当一名帮青少年解除苦闷的知心朋友而自豪。在４０１５０４３专线电话咨询处，一位年轻的接话员动情地说：“我要用我的爱心和这些苦闷的孩子交朋友。”在下午４点到５点的高峰期，接话员几乎每隔十几秒钟就要回答一位咨询者提出的问题。
    据介绍，这个咨询处的工作人员全部是无偿参加这种社会服务的。
