The Organization of African Unity is Established

Xinhua News Agency, Marrakech, February 17th - Reporter Lin Jiaoming reports: The Arab Maghreb Union was officially established this noon in Marrakech, Morocco.

The signing ceremony for the establishment of the Maghreb Union was presided over by King Hassan II of Morocco. King's Advisor Ben Suda read the document. Seated at the five-cornered table in the Marrakech City Hall were King Hassan II of Morocco, President Chadli of Algeria, President Ben Ali of Tunisia, Libyan leader Gaddafi, and Chairman Taya of the Military Committee of Mauritania, who signed the document respectively. President Ben Ali of Tunisia delivered an impromptu speech, congratulating the establishment of the Maghreb Union and thanking the Moroccan people for their warm hospitality.

The signing ceremony was solemn and enthusiastic. After the five heads of state signed the document, they embraced and kissed each other, showing a sense of harmony and unity. Libyan leader Gaddafi was particularly excited, raising both fists in celebration.

As the five heads of state exited the City Hall, the square was filled with the sound of drums and music, and the crowd's emotions reached a peak. The five heads of state boarded the same open-top car, passing through the cheering crowds, and headed to the city's oldest mosque for Friday prayers. The second Maghreb Summit Conference concluded successfully.

King Hassan II of Morocco announced at the signing ceremony that King Fahd of Saudi Arabia had called to congratulate the establishment of the Maghreb Union.
