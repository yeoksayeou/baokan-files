Two state-level second-class enterprises have had their titles revoked, and two others have been warned and given a deadline for rectification. This shows that enterprise upgrading is a serious matter, and those who do not meet the standards must be demoted.

No matter the level of the enterprise, none should practice a "lifetime tenure" system. This has been clearly stated in relevant documents issued by the State Council regarding enterprise upgrading. Some people might think that this is just "talk" and not to be taken seriously. Therefore, some enterprises, once they have achieved a certain level, no longer work as diligently as they did before upgrading. This mental relaxation leads to various problems in enterprise management. To stop this trend of stagnation or decline, we must enforce the regulation that even advanced enterprises should not have a "lifetime tenure" system. Those that do not meet the standards must be demoted.

Demoting those who are unqualified also has another significance: it promotes enterprises to focus on management and upgrading in a solid manner. Otherwise, if the quality of the enterprise does not genuinely improve, even if it temporarily "jumps" to a higher level, it will not last long. Producing high-quality products, achieving high efficiency, and reducing or eliminating safety accidents—only by improving these aspects can an enterprise have a solid foundation for upgrading. Only then can the title of an advanced enterprise be maintained and steps be taken towards becoming a higher-level advanced enterprise.

### 不合格就下来

　　不合格就下来
    两个国家二级企业被撤销称号，两个国家二级企业被警告，限期整改，这说明，企业升级工作是严肃的，不合格就得下来。
    不论哪个等级的企业都不能搞“终身制”，这一点国务院关于企业升级工作的有关文件中早有明文规定。可能有人以为那只不过是“说说”而已，不必顶真。所以，有的企业一旦上了等级，就不像早先未升级时那么兢兢业业了。思想上的松懈致使企业管理中滋生出许多问题。制止这种不进则退的现象，必须贯彻先进企业都不搞“终身制”的规定，不符合标准的就下来。
    不合格就下来，还有一个意义，那就是促进企业把抓管理、上等级的工作做扎实。否则，企业的素质没有真正上去，即使一时“突”上去了，终究也是不长久的。创造优质产品，创造高效益，减少乃至杜绝安全事故，素质提高了，企业上等级就有了根基，获得的先进企业称号才有可能保持下去，并向高一级的先进企业迈步。
