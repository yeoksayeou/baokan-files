Paraguay's new president reorganizes the military
Opposition party calls for delay in elections

	BEIJING, Feb. 8 (Xinhua) -- ASUNCION -- Paraguay's new president, Andres Rodriguez, carried out a major reorganization of the country's armed forces on Feb. 7.

	General Rodriguez, in his reorganization, appointed Brigadier General Aurelio Bernal Jimenez, commander of the First Infantry Division, as the Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces, Brigadier General Ramon Humberto Garet as the commander of the First Army, Brigadier General Ricardo Bogado Silva, commander of the Second Infantry Division, as the commander of the Second Army, and Brigadier General Juan de Dios Garay, commander of the Third Infantry Division, as the commander of the Third Army.

	According to reports, 15 brigadier and major generals were dismissed in this reorganization, with 9 of their positions being filled by colonels.

	Rodriguez came to power through a coup on Feb. 2. This major reorganization of the military will help strengthen and consolidate his position.

	BUENOS AIRES, Feb. 7 (Xinhua) -- ASUNCION -- Domingo Laíno, chairman of the Authentic Radical Liberal Party, an opposition party in Paraguay, called for the postponement of the national elections in a statement on Feb. 7.

	Rodriguez, who seized power in a coup on Feb. 2, issued a decree on Feb. 6 dissolving the National Congress, which was controlled by the former dictator Alfredo Stroessner, and decided to hold national elections on May 1.

	Laíno pointed out that the model under Stroessner was entirely fraudulent. Therefore, holding elections immediately after the overthrow of Stroessner's regime would not be acceptable to the Authentic Radical Liberal Party. He said the new government needs to postpone the election date until conditions are suitable for holding elections.

　　巴拉圭新总统改组军队
    反对党要求推迟大选
    新华社北京2月8日电　亚松森消息：巴拉圭新总统安德烈斯·罗德里格斯7日对巴拉圭武装部队进行了大改组。
    罗德里格斯将军在改组中，任命第一步兵师师长欧莱利奥·贝尔纳尔·希门尼斯准将为武装部队参谋长、第四步兵师师长拉蒙·温贝托·加尔塞特准将为第一军军长、第二步兵师师长里卡多·博加多·席尔瓦准将为第二军军长、第三步兵师师长胡安·德迪奥斯·加尔贝特准将为第三军军长。
    据报道，在这次改组中，共有15名准将和少将衔军官被撤换，其中9人的职务由上校衔军官所接替。
    罗德里格斯是在2月2日发动政变上台的，对军队进行大改组有助于加强和巩固其地位。
    新华社布宜诺斯艾利斯2月7日电　亚松森消息：巴拉圭反对党真正激进自由党主席多明戈·莱诺7日下午发表谈话，要求推迟举行全国大选。
    2月2日发动政变上台的巴拉圭新总统罗德里格斯2月6日签署法令，解散巴拉圭前独裁者斯特罗斯纳一手操纵的国民议会，决定在5月1日举行全国大选。
    莱诺指出，斯特罗斯纳时代的样板完全是欺骗。因此，在刚推翻斯特罗斯纳政权的情况下就进行选举，真正激进自由党不会去登记参加竞选。他说，新政府有必要推迟选举日期，等到条件适合时再举行大选。
