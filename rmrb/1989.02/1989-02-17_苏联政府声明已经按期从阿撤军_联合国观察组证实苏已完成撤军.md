The Soviet government today issued a statement declaring the completion of the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan. The statement said that the Soviet Union will continue to promote a peaceful and comprehensive resolution to the Afghan issue.

The statement said that in accordance with the Geneva Agreement, the Soviet Union has completed the withdrawal of its troops from Afghanistan. There are no Soviet soldiers left in Afghanistan.

The statement noted that the future development of the situation in Afghanistan will largely depend on whether the other signatories of the Geneva Agreement, along with the Kabul government, follow the Soviet example, and whether the resistance forces based in Pakistan and Iran show responsibility.

The statement once again proposed that all factions in Afghanistan immediately cease hostilities, and that all countries, including the Soviet Union and the United States, simultaneously stop supplying weapons to Afghanistan.

The statement believes that the United Nations can play a significant role in influencing the situation in Afghanistan, and that the UN's plan to provide economic and humanitarian aid to Afghanistan is a concrete contribution to Afghanistan's stability.

The statement expressed support for the Kabul government's proposal to make Afghanistan a non-aligned and neutral country.

The United Nations observation group stationed in Afghanistan and Pakistan today reported to UN Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar that the Soviet Union has completed its withdrawal from Afghanistan in accordance with the Geneva Agreement on February 15.

The UN observation group is responsible for monitoring the implementation of the Geneva Agreement. In its report to the UN Secretary-General, it expressed satisfaction with the Soviet Union's "strict and serious" adherence to the withdrawal schedule.

Following the complete withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan, the Soviet Union's First Deputy Foreign Minister and Soviet Ambassador to Afghanistan, Vorontsov, arrived in New Delhi today to discuss future issues related to Afghanistan with Indian government leaders.

According to reports, Vorontsov will discuss with Indian leaders how to break the current stalemate in Afghanistan and how to provide assistance to Afghanistan under the economic blockade imposed by Afghan guerrillas on cities like Kabul.

		The last Soviet soldier to leave Afghanistan, General Gromov, commander of the Soviet forces in Afghanistan, returned to the Soviet town of Termez from the Afghan border city of Hairatan. This is General Gromov (front left) with his son (front right) who came to greet him at the border.

    新华社莫斯科２月１５日电  苏联政府今天就苏军全部撤出阿富汗发表声明说，苏联今后仍将促使阿富汗问题获得和平的与一揽子的解决。
    声明说，苏联根据日内瓦协议，完成了从阿富汗的撤军。现在在阿富汗已经没有一个苏联士兵。
    声明认为，今后阿富汗形势的发展在很大程度上取决于日内瓦协议的其他签字国是否效法苏联和喀布尔政权的榜样，以巴基斯坦和伊朗领土为基地的抵抗力量是否表现出责任感。
    声明再次建议阿富汗敌对各派立即停火，包括苏联和美国在内的所有国家同时停止向阿富汗运送武器。
    声明认为，联合国在影响阿富汗事态方面能起巨大作用，联合国制定的对阿富汗进行经济和人道援助的计划是其对阿富汗安定作出的具体贡献。
    声明表示支持喀布尔政权提出的使阿富汗成为不结盟和中立国家的建议。

    新华社新德里２月１６日电　紧接着苏联从阿富汗全部撤军之后，苏联第一副外长兼苏联驻阿富汗大使沃龙佐夫今天抵达这里，与印度政府领导人会谈有关阿富汗的未来问题。
