The wind of fair play blows strong at the National College Student Basketball Tournament. The tournament, held recently in Harbin, concluded with participants praising the event's integrity and sportsmanship.

The tournament had strict regulations: retired athletes who were once part of elite teams were not allowed to participate. Any team found violating this rule would be disqualified. Some teams attempted to bring ineligible players, intending to use them if necessary. However, the strict enforcement by the designated eligibility review committee prevented any such attempts, ensuring no complaints arose over eligibility issues.

The tournament received sponsorship from several companies, but the organizers managed the event frugally. There were no lavish banquets, and the meals for coaches and athletes were prepared according to the standards of typical domestic tournaments. Accommodation was arranged in student dormitories. Apart from the stipulated labor fees for referees, no one received any souvenirs or additional compensation.

　　全国大学生篮球赛风气正
    本报哈尔滨２月２日电“球场内外风气正，输球心里也舒畅。”全国大学生友谊杯篮球赛刚刚在这里结束后，参赛的教练员和运动员这样评价这次比赛。
    这次比赛明文规定：优秀运动队退役队员一律不允许参赛，一经发现，取消该队参赛资格。有的队把不具备参赛资格的选手带来，准备见风使舵。由于特设的资格审查组“执法”严格，谁也未动用“特种部队”，没有发生因资格问题而告状的现象。
    这次比赛得到一些厂家赞助，但是组织者克勤克俭办赛事，始终未搞大型宴会，教练员和运动员的伙食参照国内一般赛事标准执行；以学生宿舍楼解决住宿问题。除了按规定发给裁判员一定劳务费外，没有向任何人发纪念品。
