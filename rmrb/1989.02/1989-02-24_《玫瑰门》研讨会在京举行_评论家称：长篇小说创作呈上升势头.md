The symposium on the novel "The Rose Gate" was held in Beijing. Critics say: Long-form novel creation is on the rise.

	Reported by our reporter Bì Shèng: In contemporary literary creation, reportage literature has emerged as a powerful force, causing the readership of novels to shrink. The so-called "three novels a day" literary heavyweights—long-form novels—are also facing cold shoulders or criticism. However, at the symposium on the long-form novel "The Rose Gate" held on February 22, participants discussed the current state of long-form novel creation and agreed that if one carefully reads recent long-form novels, one can see that a group of mid-career and young writers are dedicated to creating long-form novels. In terms of reflecting life, exploring themes, and artistic expression, there have been new breakthroughs, and long-form novel creation is on the rise.

	"The Rose Gate," published in the inaugural issue of "Literature Seasons," is the first long-form novel by young female writer Tiě Níng. The novel depicts the ordinary yet tumultuous experiences of three generations of women in a family, describing their shared pursuit and transformation of emotions amidst life's storms. The grandmother, Sī Qí Wén, has weathered many storms and is worldly and gloomy; the daughter-in-law, Sòng Zhú Xī, seeks spiritual and physical liberation in turbulent times; the granddaughter, Méi Méi, witnesses the distortions and evils of the "Cultural Revolution" and the goodness and evil in the world, gaining insights into the truths of life. The three women, through mutual dependence and struggle, experience the hardships and bitterness of life.

	Participants believe that the writer's examination of life is severe and calm. The novel uses the perspective of a young girl to view a life full of temptations, hardships, and warmth. The analysis of human nature is thorough, and in evaluating life, the writer attempts to rise from historical and moral levels to human and cultural levels, depicting the tenacious life force of people under heavy pressure. Old writer Wāng Zēngqí said that such a long novel of 350,000 words aims to present the original state of life and create a non-rational, non-standardized living atmosphere. However, it can only be understood after reading the entire work. Léi Dá and Zēng Zhènnán believe that the novel reflects a new sense of time and space, showing both the narrow self-interest of Eastern culture and rising to the universality of humanity to observe history and culture, depicting the irrationality of people. Many people mentioned that the vivid details in the novel enrich the characters' personalities. The images of Sī Qí Wén and the uncle are rare in contemporary literature. Some people also think that the writer overemphasizes the details, making the characters' personalities and plot development seem dull and sluggish.

	The symposium also discussed the writer's feminine consciousness. Lǐ Tuō believes that the text in the work provides people with a feminist perspective. Wú Bǐngjié believes that the writer's understanding of life is feminized. However, some people, including the author, believe that the characters' perspectives in the work cannot be equated with feminist consciousness and feminine consciousness.

	Regarding the writer's style changes, some people want to maintain the impression of "Ah, Xiǎnxuě" and "The Red Shirt Without Buttons," while others believe that the writer's feminine penmanship provides a delicate and profound understanding of life, making the work's connotation more expansive.

	The symposium was jointly organized by the Hebei Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles, Wenyi Bao, and the Writers Publishing House. Wáng Mèng, Lǐ Guówén, Xiè Yǒngwàng, Cóng Wéixī, Qián Róng, Xú Guāngyào, Zhōu Shēnmíng, Wú Tàichāng, Cài Kuí, Hé Zhènbāng, and others attended the meeting.

　　《玫瑰门》研讨会在京举行
    评论家称：长篇小说创作呈上升势头
    本报讯  记者毕胜报道：当前文学创作中，报告文学异军突起，使小说的读者群日益缩小，号称“日产三部”的文学重武器——长篇小说更是受到冷遇或指责。但在２２日召开的长篇小说《玫瑰门》讨论会上，与会者就《玫瑰门》谈到当前长篇创作时，认为只要认真阅读近期的长篇创作，可以看出一批中青年作家致力于长篇的创作，在反映生活、题旨开掘和艺术感受方面都有新的突破，长篇创作呈上升势头。
    发表在《文学四季》创刊号上的《玫瑰门》是青年女作家铁凝的第一部长篇新作。小说以一个家庭老少三代女人平凡而坷坎的经历，描写了她们在风风雨雨的人生磨难中，共同经历的感情追求和变异，爱欲的诱惑和折磨。祖母司绮纹历经沧桑，世故而阴沉；儿媳宋竹西在动乱年代追求灵与肉的解脱；外孙女眉眉目睹“文革”中种种扭曲变态和人世的邪恶善良，领悟人生的真谛。三代女人在互相依偎、较量中体察人生的艰辛和辛酸。
    与会者认为，作家对人生的审视是严酷而冷静的，小说以一个女孩子童年视角来看待充满诱惑、磨难而不乏温馨的人生。对人性的剖析淋漓尽致，在对生活的评价中力图从历史和道德的层面上升到人性的和文化的层面，写人在重压下顽强的生命力。老作家汪曾祺说，这样长达３５万字的小说，作者力图表明生活的原生态，创造一种非理智化非规范化的生活氛围。但只有在读完全篇后才能理解。雷达、曾镇南认为，小说表现了新的时空意识，既表现东方文化的狭隘自私性又上升到人类的普遍性来观照历史和文化，表现人的非理性。不少人谈到小说生动的细节丰富了人物性格，司绮纹和姑爹的形象是当代文学不可多得的。也有的认为作家过分渲染了细节，以致在人物性格和情节开展上显得沉闷和冗滞。
    讨论会上有争议的是作家流露出来的女性意识。李陀认为，作品中的文本提供了人们从女权主义角度来认识。吴秉杰认为作家对人生的理解是女性化的。但也有人包括作者则认为，并不能把作品中的人物视角与女权意识和女性意识等同。
    对作家风格变化，有人愿意保持原来对《啊，香雪》、《没有纽扣的红衬衫》的印象，也有人认为作家女性的笔致对人生的认识细腻而深刻，其作品内涵更为廓大了。
    研讨会由河北省文联、文艺报和作家出版社联合举行。王蒙、李国文、谢永旺、从维熙、谌容、徐光耀、周申明、吴泰昌、蔡葵、何镇邦等参加了会议。
