Canada's Foreign Minister Clark said on January 30 that if the voluntary sanctions against South Africa do not work, the Canadian government will impose mandatory trade sanctions on South Africa.

This is Clark's first foreign policy statement after being appointed as the new foreign minister by Mulroney on January 30. He said, "If voluntary restrictions do not work, we will have to consider other options."

Canada announced voluntary sanctions against South Africa in 1985. However, a government report released last week showed that Canada's imports from South Africa increased by 68% last year, and exports to South Africa increased by 44%.

Clark said that implementing mandatory measures means imposing some form of punishment on Canadian businesses trading with South Africa. However, he also said that he supports voluntary sanctions because voluntary actions by the business community without government coercion are more persuasive.

### 加可能对南非实行禁运

　　加可能对南非实行禁运
    加拿大外交部长克拉克１月３０日说，如果对南非实行的自愿制裁的办法行不通，加政府将对南非实行强制性的贸易禁运。
    这是克拉克３０日被马尔罗尼指定为新政府的外长后发表的第一个外交政策声明。他说，“如果自愿限制不起作用，我们将不得不考虑其它选择。”
    加拿大在１９８５年宣布了对南非实行自愿制裁的措施。但据上周公布的政府报告表明，加拿大去年从南非的进口额增长了６８％，对南非的出口增加了４４％。
    克拉克说，实行强制性措施意味着将对同南非从事贸易的加拿大商人给予某种形式的惩罚。但是他又说，他赞成自愿性制裁，因为商界没有政府的强制命令而自愿采取制裁行动具有更强的说服力。
