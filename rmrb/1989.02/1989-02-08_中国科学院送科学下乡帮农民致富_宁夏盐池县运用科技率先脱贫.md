The Chinese Academy of Sciences has sent science to the countryside to help farmers get rich. Yinchuan County in Ningxia has used science and technology to become the first to shake off poverty.

	Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan, February 7 (Reporters Wang Manchang, Correspondent Dai Liang) Yinchuan County, listed by the Chinese Academy of Sciences as a national agricultural modernization scientific experiment base, has seen science and technology transformed into productive forces, making it the county with the highest per capita income among the mountain counties in Ningxia.

	According to statistics, in 1987, the per capita income in this county was 250 yuan; last year, it was 300 yuan, with per capita grain ownership of 250 kilograms. The basic problem of farmers' food and clothing has been solved.

	Yinchuan County is one of the eight poor counties in Ningxia. In 1978, it was listed by the Chinese Academy of Sciences as a national agricultural modernization scientific experiment base. Over the past 10 years, the Chinese Academy of Sciences has organized scientific and technological forces from within and outside the region to conduct a comprehensive survey of natural resources in Yinchuan County. They helped formulate the production policy of "livestock as the mainstay" and the zoning and planning for economic development. On this basis, the Lanzhou Desert Research Institute, the Northwest Institute of Botany, the Northwest Agricultural University, the Ningxia Agricultural College, and the Ningxia Agricultural Academy, along with more than 30 experts and technicians from these units, established four comprehensive development research bases. They explored models for economic development in different types of regions and conducted demonstration and promotion work throughout the county. Now, these four experimental bases have achieved varying degrees of success. The experiences and technological achievements generated by the bases have been widely promoted and applied throughout the county, achieving remarkable economic benefits.

	The "Siduzi" base has built a comprehensive experimental model for "agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry," summarizing the experience of "livestock based on grass" and "three highs and one fast" (total increase, high quality, high commercial rate, and fast livestock turnover) in livestock production. After being widely promoted throughout the county, the average commercial rate increased by more than 60%. In 1988, the county's livestock income reached 20 million yuan, with a per capita income of 180 yuan.

	The foundation for developing livestock lies in grassland construction. The research results of scientific and technological workers on the improvement of natural grasslands, the cultivation technology of artificial pastures, and the prevention and control of grassland desertification have found new ways to handle the relationship between the ecological environment and the development of animal husbandry. Under the guidance of these research results, Yinchuan County has afforested and planted grass over 1.1 million mu in the past six years, improving and replanting 1.15 million mu of grasslands.

	Now, the county has initially formed six series of products, including livestock product processing, feed processing, and food processing. Industrial and commercial taxes in 1988 increased by 1.65 times compared to the previous year.

　　中国科学院送科学下乡帮农民致富
　　宁夏盐池县运用科技率先脱贫
    新华社银川２月７日电  （记者王漫沧、通讯员戴亮）被中国科学院列为全国农业现代化科学试验基地的盐池县，由于科学技术形成生产力，现已成为宁夏山区县中人均收入最高的县。
    据统计，１９８７年这个县人均收入２５０元；去年人均收入３００元，人均占有粮食２５０公斤，农民的温饱初步解决。
    盐池县是宁夏８个贫困县之一。１９７８年被中科院列为全国农业现代化科学试验基地。１０年来，中科院先后组织区内外的科技力量，对盐池县进行了全面的自然资源综合考察，帮助他们制定了“以牧为主”的生产方针和发展经济的区划、规划。在此基础上，兰州沙漠研究所、西北植物所、西北农业大学、宁夏农学院、宁夏农科院等单位的３０多位专家和科技人员，建立了４个综合开发研究基点，探索不同类型地区经济开发的模式，并向全县开展示范推广工作。现在这４个试验基地都取得不同程度的成功，基地所产生的经验和科技成果已在全县得到广泛的推广应用，取得十分显著的经济效益。
    四墩子基点“农林牧综合实验样板建设”，总结出在畜牧业生产中“以草定畜”和“三高一快”（总增高、质量高、商品率高、畜群周转快）的经验，在全县普遍推广后，平均商品率提高６０％以上，１９８８年全县牧业收入达２０００万元，人均１８０元。
    发展畜牧业的基础在于草原建设。科技工作者关于天然草原的补播改良、人工牧草栽培技术和草原沙化的防治等研究成果，为处理好生态环境和发展畜牧业的关系找到新的途径。在这些科研成果的指导下，盐池县近６年造林、种草１１０多万亩，补播改良草原１１５万亩。
    现在，这个县已初步形成以畜产品加工、饲料加工、食品加工等６个系列产品，工业利税１９８８年比上年增长１．６５倍。
