Qiao Shi, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and head of the Central Party Building Work Small Group, emphasized at the Central Party Building Research Class that ended today that party building in the new period must closely revolve around the theme of building the party into a strong core leading socialist modernization. He said that party building must be closely linked to the party's basic line.

Qiao Shi said that our party is in another broad and profound historical transformation period. The greater the transformation, the greater the test for the party, and the more we need to pay attention to and strengthen party building. Whether we can build our party better or not is not only related to the rise or fall of the party itself, but also to the success or failure of the socialist modernization construction. He hoped that everyone would scientifically and objectively recognize the current state of the party, boost their spirits, increase their confidence, pool their wisdom, and further build a good party.

Qiao Shi pointed out in his discussion on the guiding ideology of party building that party building in the new period and the study of party building in the new period must be closely linked to the party's basic line. He said that to grasp the intrinsic link between party building and the basic line, three points need to be noted: (1) Party building and strict party governance must be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the basic line. All party building work, including the selection and training of cadres, the configuration of leading cadres, the construction of grassroots organizations, the education and development of party members, the implementation of party discipline, etc., must conform to and serve the basic line. (2) Party building must be closely linked to the implementation of the basic line. That is, the party's organizations at all levels and the majority of party members and cadres must be organized and mobilized to play their due role in the practice of implementing the basic line. (3) The effectiveness of implementing the basic line must be used to test party building work. This is the standard of practice. Generally speaking, where party building work is done well, the results of material civilization and spiritual civilization construction will be good, and the prestige of the party organization will be high. Conversely, if the implementation of the basic line is not good, or if there is an important deviation in some aspects, it always indicates that there are problems within the party organization that need to be solved urgently.

Qiao Shi pointed out that we must continue to firmly implement the policy of revolutionizing, rejuvenating, intellectualizing, and professionalizing the cadre team, proceed from reality, and further build a good leading cadre team at all levels, and promote the reform of the cadre system. He emphasized that we should not oppose or confuse the "four modernizations" guiding ideology of the party's cadre work in the new period with the principle of selecting cadres with both virtue and ability that the party has always adhered to, as well as the specific standards for identifying and selecting cadres. In selecting and appointing cadres, different standards cannot be used for leading cadres of party and government organs and enterprises and institutions, and for leading cadres of the same unit at different levels and in different positions. But no matter what kind of cadres are selected, attention must be paid to revolutionization.

Qiao Shi said that according to the "four modernizations" policy for cadres, it is still a strategic task of the party to discover, cultivate, and select a batch of comrades who are proven in practice to be both virtuous and talented from outstanding middle-aged and young intellectuals. This is not only a requirement of the current situation, but also a need to prepare reliable talents to shoulder the heavy historical responsibilities of the next century. Therefore, cadre work should not stop at the simple allocation of existing personnel, but should also invest a lot of effort in the development of cadre resources.

Qiao Shi said that we must earnestly strengthen the cultivation and improvement of existing leading cadres, and continue to resolutely and steadily promote the reform of the cadre system.

Qiao Shi also gave his opinions on how the members of the research class should grasp party building work after returning.

　　乔石在中央党建研究班上强调
    加强党的建设须联系基本路线
    从优秀中青年知识分子中选拔干部仍是一项战略任务
    本报北京二月二日讯  本报记者尹品端、新华社记者孙本尧报道：中共中央政治局常委、中央党的建设工作小组组长乔石，在今天结束的中央党的建设研究班上指出，新时期党的建设，要紧紧围绕把党建设成为领导社会主义现代化事业的坚强核心这个主题，密切联系党的基本路线来进行。
    乔石说，我们党正处在又一次广泛而深刻的历史性大转变时期。越是大转变时期，越是对党的考验，越需要重视和加强党的建设。能否把我们党建设得更好，不仅关系到党本身的兴衰，而且关系到社会主义现代化建设事业的成败。他希望大家科学地实事求是地认识党的现状，振奋精神，增强信心，群策群力，进一步把党建设好。
    乔石在谈到党的建设的指导思想时指出，新时期党的建设和研究新时期党的建设，都必须密切联系党的基本路线。他说，把握好党的建设同基本路线的内在联系，需要注意三点：（一）必须按基本路线的要求来建设党和从严治党。党的建设的一切工作，包括选拔培训干部、配备领导班子、建设基层组织、教育发展党员、执行党的纪律等等，都要符合和服务于基本路线。（二）必须密切联系基本路线的贯彻执行进行党的建设。就是说，要把党的各级组织和广大党员、干部，组织并调动起来，在实现基本路线的实践中发挥应有的作用。（三）必须用执行基本路线的实效来检验党建工作，这是实践的标准。一般说，哪里党建工作做得好，哪里物质文明和精神文明建设的效果就会好，党组织的威信也就高。反过来，如果执行基本路线不够好，或者某一方面发生了重要偏差，也总是表明党组织内存在这样那样的问题亟待解决。
    乔石指出，要继续坚定不移地执行干部队伍革命化、年轻化、知识化、专业化的方针，从实际出发，进一步建设好各级领导班子，切实推进干部制度改革。他强调，不要把“四化”这一新时期党的干部工作的指导方针和党历来坚持的任用干部的德才兼备原则以及识别和选拔干部的具体标准对立起来，或者混同起来。在选拔任用干部时，对党政机关和企事业单位的领导干部，对同一单位不同层次、不同岗位的领导干部，都不能用同一标准。但无论选什么干部，都要注重革命化。
    乔石说，根据干部“四化”方针，着重从优秀中青年知识分子中发现、培养、选拔一批实践证明确属德才兼备的同志，仍然是党的一项战略任务，这不仅是当前形势的需要，而且是准备足以担当跨世纪历史重任的可靠人才的需要。因此，干部工作决不能停留在对现有人员的简单调配上，还要花大气力去做干部资源的开发工作。
    乔石说，要切实加强对现有领导干部的培养提高，同时继续坚决而稳妥地推进干部制度的改革。
    乔石还对研究班成员回去后怎样抓党建工作谈了意见。
