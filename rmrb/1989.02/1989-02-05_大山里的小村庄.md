The Small Village in the Mountains

Beijing, Feng Tai

I heard that in Shandong Province, Laiwu City, many farmers have moved into the mountains to settle, taking over barren mountains for afforestation, with good results. In the once desolate mountains, new settlements have emerged. Recently, taking the opportunity of a trip to Shandong for a meeting, I went there to conduct an interview.

The jeep left the Shengjing Township government and drove for more than 20 kilometers on the rugged mountain roads, stopping at a small village surrounded by mountains. This place is called Luojia Gorge, located beside a small valley. Three brick houses housed three farming families. The village was lively with the sounds of chickens and dogs, and the blades of the wind-powered generator hummed, giving it a vibrant atmosphere.

"The spring would be even better. The peach and pear blossoms would compete in beauty, and the locust and cypress trees would be lush and green," Laiwu City Forestry Bureau Director Wang Shenghai regretfully described to me. In fact, seeing the rows of fruit trees in the terraced fields and the patches of trees on the nearby and distant mountains, one could easily imagine that the spring here must be intoxicating.

The courtyard of Hua Fuman's home was not large. The water tap protruding from the ground caught the eye, drawing sweet water from a source 100 meters away.

"Our Beibaita Village has more than 2,000 mu of mountain land. In the past, the village sent 24 people to manage the mountain, with annual expenses of more than 4,500 yuan, and annual income of less than 2,000 yuan. The trees on the mountain were becoming fewer and fewer, and by 1982, they were almost all gone," Hua Fuman said slowly. "In 1983, nine households from our village moved into the mountains in three groups to settle and take over the afforestation. In just five or six years, the trees on the mountain have grown, and the fruits have been bountiful. Now, there is no more room to plant trees in Luojia Gorge."

Another household head, Wang Yushan, added, "The mountains have turned green, and we have become rich. Take me for example, in the year I settled, I earned more than 700 yuan. Later, when the trees bore fruit and the forest produced more, my income increased. In the past two years, I have earned nearly 10,000 yuan each year."

After bidding farewell to Shengjing Township, we drove to visit Shicheng Village and Jingyao Village in Gaozhuang Township. Li Xinhuai was the first person from Shicheng Village to move into the mountains to settle. He focused on cultivating hawthorn on the barren mountains he took over. He loves to learn and is diligent in his research, and was elected as the chairman of the township's hawthorn research association. In 1987, his family harvested more than 750 kilograms of hawthorn. Under his influence, Shicheng Village now has 48 households that have moved into the mountains to settle.

The facts have proven that farmers moving into the mountains to settle and afforest can ensure that one patch is planted and one patch is successful, with good economic benefits. Many farmers in the township have become specialized fruit farmers. Last year, the income from fruits reached more than 7.3 million yuan, becoming the township's pillar industry.

In Laiwu, farmers moving into the mountains to settle and afforest barren mountains have spread to all 28 townships in the city. There are 2,017 households of farmers who have moved into the mountains, managing more than 320,000 mu of mountain forests. Over the past few years, the city, township, and village governments have provided enthusiastic support and services, including building more than 9,000 rooms, laying more than 12,000 meters of high-voltage lines, and constructing 1,400 kilometers of mountain-ringing roads...

Listening to the introduction, I understood that in the development and afforestation of barren mountains, farmers have tremendous potential.

　　大山里的小村庄
    北京　冯泰
    听说山东省莱芜市有许多农民进山定居，承包荒山，效果不错。在昔日荒无人烟的大山里，出现了一个个新的居民点。不久前借去山东开会之机，我前往那里采访。
    吉普车从圣井乡政府出发，在崎岖的山路上奔驰了２０多公里，停在一个群山环绕着的小山村。这里叫罗家峪，坐落在一条小山沟旁。三套砖瓦房里，住着三户农民。小村里鸡鸣狗叫，风力发电机的叶片呼呼吟唱，显得颇有生气。
    “要是春天来就好了。桃花、梨花、争相斗艳，刺槐、柏树青翠欲滴。”莱芜市林业局长王圣海不无遗憾地向我描绘着。其实，看到那梯田里的行行果树和近山远山的片片树林，不难想象出：这里的春天确实醉人。
    花福满家的院子不大。从地下钻出来的水龙头惹人注目，它从百米外为主人引来甘源。
    “俺北白塔村有２０００多亩山地。过去，村里派２４人管山，每年开销４５００多元，年收入不足２０００元，山上的树也越来越少，到１９８２年几乎都光了。”花福满不紧不慢地说，“１９８３年，俺们村９户农民分３片进山定居，承包绿化，这才五六年，山上的树长起来了，果子也丰收了。如今，这罗家峪已经没地方栽树了。”
    另一户主人王玉山接着说：“山绿了，俺们也富了。就说俺吧，定居的当年就收入７００多元。后来树挂了果，林子里物产多了，收入越来越多。这两年每年收入近万元。”
    告别了圣井乡，我们又驱车走访了高庄镇的石棚村和井峪村。李心怀是石棚村第一个进山定居的，他在承包的荒山上重点培育山楂。他爱学习、肯钻研，被大家选为镇山楂研究会会长。１９８７年，他家收山楂７５０多公斤。在他的带动下，石棚村已有进山定居户４８户了。
    事实证明，农民进山定居绿化，能保证造一片，成一片，经济效益也不错。镇里许多农民成了林果专业户。去年林果收入达７３０多万元，成了镇上的支柱产业。
    在莱芜，农民进山定居绿化荒山的，已遍及全市２８个乡镇。进山定居的农民２０１７户，经营着３２万多亩山林。几年来，市、乡、镇、村对进山定居给予了热情的扶持和服务，其中修建房屋９０００余间，架设高压线１．２万多米，修环山公路１４００公里……
    听着介绍，我明白了，在开发和绿化荒山中，农家有着巨大的潜力。
