BEIJING, Feb. 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze continued their talks this morning at the Great Hall of the People. The two foreign ministers further exchanged views on the issue of holding a high-level meeting between China and the Soviet Union.

Shevardnadze, on behalf of Gorbachev, accepted the invitation and expressed gratitude for Yang's invitation.

During the talks, Qian pointed out that the two countries should establish new state-to-state relations on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and develop economic relations between the two countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. He emphasized that China pursues an independent and peaceful foreign policy, and the normalization of Sino-Soviet relations will not affect China's relations with other countries.

During the talks, the two foreign ministers also discussed other issues in bilateral relations, including the development of economic and trade relations. Both sides also exchanged views on some international issues and reported their respective positions. Both foreign ministers agreed that the United Nations and the UN Secretary-General play an important role in easing international tensions.
