Japanese Prime Minister Bunsho's remarks justifying the war of aggression have drawn strong criticism from public opinion in China, Italy, South Korea, and other countries and regions. Local news media have provided detailed reports. This morning, Bunsho convened a meeting with key cabinet members to discuss countermeasures and decided to promptly explain the situation through diplomatic channels to relevant countries to seek understanding.

After the cabinet meeting, Foreign Minister Uno told reporters that Bunsho's response to the aggression issue in the Diet "had some shortcomings. Perhaps because it was considered common knowledge, it was not fully explained." He emphasized that the government's stance on this issue has not changed.

Bunsho said in the Diet today to reporters: "I have repeatedly stated that we must fully recognize the fact that the international community regards the last war as an aggression and has made serious criticisms, and therefore we must contribute to peace."

According to local newspaper reports, West German President Weizsäcker, before departing for Japan to attend the funeral of Emperor Showa, met with Japanese reporters and said: "Every country's citizens face the issue of recognizing their own history. It is my responsibility to ensure that Germans do not avoid this issue."

　　发言受到国际舆论抨击  竹下召集阁员商讨对策
    本报东京２月２１日电  记者于青报道：日本首相竹下登为侵略战争辩解的发言受到中国、意大利、南朝鲜等国家和地区舆论的强烈批判，此间新闻媒介作了详细报道。今天上午，竹下召集内阁主要成员商讨对策，决定尽快通过外交渠道向有关国家进行说明，求得理解。
    宇野外相在内阁会议结束后会见记者时说，竹下首相就侵略战争问题在国会的答辩“有欠缺部分。也许是考虑到是人所共知的事情，未作充分说明。”并强调，政府在这个问题上的态度没有变化。
    竹下今天在国会对记者说：“我多次表明，要充分认识到国际上认为上次战争是侵略战争并进行了严肃的批判这一事实，因此要为和平作出贡献。”
    据此间报纸报道，西德总统魏茨泽克在来日参加昭和天皇葬礼出发前，会见日本记者时说：“每个国家的国民都面临认识本国历史的问题。让德国人不回避这一课题是我的责任。”
