		Bando Again Defends Aggressive War in Response to Opposition Party's Interrogation
		Our reporter Yu Qing reports from Tokyo on February 18:

		Japanese Prime Minister Bando today, during a parliamentary session, again defended the aggressive war, stating: "There are various theories regarding aggressive war. Which one to take as the standard has not been determined even in United Nations discussions, so it is difficult to conclude. Whether the last war (World War II) was an aggressive war should be evaluated by future historians."

		Bando made the above remarks in response to the opposition party's question: "Former Prime Minister Nakasone had admitted that the last war was an aggressive war. What is Prime Minister Bando's view on this?"

		Local public opinion believes that this is Bando's explicit expression that Japan's actions during World War II were not necessarily aggressive.

　　回答在野党质询时   
    竹下再次为侵略战争辩解
    本报东京２月１８日电  记者于青报道：日本首相竹下今天在国会答辩中再次为侵略战争辩解说：“关于侵略战争有多种学说，以哪一个为基准，在联合国讨论也未做出定论，因此难以确定。上次战争是不是侵略战争，应由后世史学家来评价。”
    竹下是在回答在野党提出的“前首相中曾根曾承认上次战争（第二次世界大战）是侵略，竹下首相对此有何见解”的质询时，做出上述回答的。
    此间舆论认为，这是竹下首相明确地表明第二次世界大战中日本的行为不一定是侵略的见解。
