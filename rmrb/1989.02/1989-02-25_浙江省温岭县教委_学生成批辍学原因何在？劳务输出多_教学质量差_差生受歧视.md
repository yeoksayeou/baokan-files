The prosperity of the social economy should logically bring about the development of education. However, in recent years, the phenomenon of junior high school students in rural areas of Wenling County dropping out to work or engage in business has been quite serious and is on the rise. In 1983, 13.27% of junior high school students, mainly those in the second year, discontinued their studies. By 1988, this figure had risen to 16.1%. Despite various measures taken by the county's Education Bureau, the situation remains unchecked.

In some economically developed areas of Wenling County, the number of students dropping out is also high. The Zeguo District and Daxi District, located along the Hangzhou-Wenzhou Highway, have convenient transportation and timely information. Household industries thrive, and shops and stalls are ubiquitous. Many junior high school students in these areas do not wait until graduation to find nearby work or accompany their parents to peddle goods or run businesses. The student dropout rate in these two districts is the highest in the county.

The quality of teaching is directly related to student dropout rates. Schools with higher teaching quality have higher student retention rates, while schools with lower teaching quality see students losing confidence and leaving at the first opportunity. According to statistics from 10 schools, 43% of students who dropped out cited poor academic performance, lack of interest, and lack of confidence. From 1985 to 1986, Wenling Middle School, a provincial key school, had no students drop out; a county key school had 4.7% of students drop out, while general junior high schools had 27.5% dropouts, and the lowest-performing junior high school, Nantang Middle School, had 51.3% dropouts. In recent years, the annual average dropout rate for junior high school students in Wenling County has been significantly higher than the regional and provincial averages. The reasons are as follows: First, Wenling County has a high rate of labor export. Out of a population of 1.02 million, 100,000 have gone out to work. Second, rural economies are heavily influenced by the "Southern Zhejiang Model," with highly developed contract and individual economies, leading students to drop out to work or engage in business before graduation. Third, the quality of school teaching is not high, artificially causing students to drop out. Fourth, some schools have misguided educational philosophies, focusing solely on promoting students to higher education. From the principal to the teachers, they favor students with good grades and neglect those with poor grades. Consequently, underperforming students have the least confidence in their studies and are the most likely to drop out.

　　浙江省温岭县教委——
    学生成批辍学原因何在？
    劳务输出多　教学质量差　差生受歧视
    社会经济的繁荣，理应带来教育的大发展。然而，近些年来，我们温岭县农村初中生辍学从工、经商的情况相当严重，而且有增无减。１９８３年有１３．２７％的初中生，主要是初二的学生中断了学业，１９８８年达到１６．１％。县教委采取了多种措施，仍无法挽回。
    温岭县的一些商品经济发达地区，辍学的学生也较多。泽国区和大溪区处在杭温公路沿线，交通便利，信息灵通，家庭工业十分兴旺，开店设铺比比皆是。这里的大量初中学生不到毕业便就近做工或随同父母跑码头，做生意。这两个区的学生流失比例在全县是最高的。
    教学质量与学生辍学直接相关。教学质量较高的中学，学生巩固率高，教学质量低的学校，学生即使进了学校，也信心不足，一有机会就想走。据１０所中学统计，学习成绩跟不上，缺乏兴趣和信心者占退学总数的４３％。省重点中学温岭中学１９８５年至１９８６年没有一名学生辍学；县重点中学同期有４．７％学生辍学，一般初中辍学生达２７．５％，戴帽初中南塘中学辍学生多达５１．３％。近几年来，温岭县初中辍学学生的年平均率远比地区和省的高。原因何在？论教育基础我们县并不比别县差，数办学条件也不在下游。细加分析，有其独特原因：一，温岭县劳务输出多。全县１０２万人，有１０万人外出；二是农村经济深受“浙南模式”影响，联产与个体经济特别发达，学生未等毕业就去做工或经商赚钱；三是学校教学质量不高，人为地造成辍学生；四是不少学校办学指导思想不正，存在着片面追求升学率倾向，从校长到教师重视成绩好的学生，轻视成绩差的学生，而差生读书最没有信心，最容易跑掉。
