Chemists in Kharkov, Ukraine, have invented a new type of film that increases the yield of cucumbers and tomatoes in greenhouses by 25%.

This new film is infused with fluorescent powder, which reflects excess sunlight and evenly disperses blue and red light. The film also converts harmful ultraviolet rays into blue light that plants can absorb. The new film has strong light transmission, is resistant to cold, heat, and sunlight, and has excellent insulation properties.
