Title: The Forbidden City Implements New Measures

Starting this year, the Forbidden City in Beijing is implementing protective opening measures.

I joined the tourists from the southern ticket office and walked north through the Meridian Gate. The entrance was orderly, and the tourist routes were no longer crowded.

In recent years, the number of visitors to the Forbidden City has been too high. Since 1985, the number of visitors has exceeded 10 million each year, with a daily record of over 80,000. In the past, tourists would enter from the south through the Meridian Gate and exit through the Shenwu Gate to the north, far exceeding the Forbidden City's capacity. Trampling and touching have caused damage to the walls, roads collapsing, and the bronze vats in front of the Hall of Supreme Harmony, which had their gold plating scraped off by the Eight-Nation Alliance, have had their bronze rings broken by Chinese visitors in recent years. Facing a 720,000-square-meter tourist area and a large number of visitors, the 400 management staff were overwhelmed. The first measure of the new policy is to move the ticket office south to create some distance from the crowd; the daily number of visitors is limited to 25,000, and up to 30,000 on holidays; the route is changed to only allow entry through the Meridian Gate. Officials from the Forbidden City told the reporter that in the past month, the entrance order has been easier to maintain, the visitor crowd is easier to manage, and the walking paths are no longer congested.

Another new measure is that a separate ticket is required to enter the Imperial Garden. The Imperial Garden, known for its pavilions, halls, ponds, water pavilions, rare flowers, strange rocks, and ancient pines, was once a must-see for tourists coming and going. Visitors would eat, drink, sit, and lie down here, damaging the pavilions, polluting the water, breaking the stones, and killing the pines. The large number of visitors trampled the land so much that water could not seep in, and many ancient trees have died. The deep courtyard of the Imperial Garden seems a bit "quiet" now. According to Director Fang Guojin of the Office of the Palace Museum, after charging an entrance fee, only one-quarter of all visitors enter the garden, and most of them appreciate its beauty.

New rules have brought new problems.

The security guards complain: Every day, a crowd gathers at the entrance to the Imperial Garden at the Kunning Gate, some hesitating whether the 2-yuan ticket is worth it, some wanting to just take a peek, and others complaining about the high price; even more people are asking for directions: "If we don't enter the Imperial Garden, how do we get out through the North Gate?" The security guards answer: "Go east, then south, then east and north." This leaves them with dry mouths and sore tongues. Now they plan to move the ticket office to the more spacious Qianqing Gate and consider designing a new, more appropriate tourist route. Limiting the number of visitors has resulted in reduced income, and they have requested a state subsidy; they also plan to build a paid parking lot and luggage storage at the Meridian Gate, all to solve some financial problems.

This approach, I believe, people will be able to understand.

　　故宫施行“新政”之后
    本报记者  袁晞
    今年开始，北京故宫实行保护性开放措施。
    我随游人从南边售票处经午门北行。进门秩序井然，游览线路不再拥挤。
    故宫近些年参观人数过多。１９８５年以后观众人次每年都超过１０００万，日纪录破８万。过去游人南进午门，北走神武门，大大超过了故宫的承受力。踩踏抠摸，致使宫墙破损，道路塌陷，太和殿前当年八国联军刮去镀金的铜缸近年又被国人掰折了铜环。面对７２万平方米的游览区和大量游人，４００名管理人员顾此失彼。新办法的第一条就是售票处南移，与人口拉开一段距离；日参观人数限于２５０００，节假日不超过３００００；路线改为只能从午门进入。故宫的同志告诉记者，一个多月来进门秩序较易维持，参观人群好管理，行进道路不再发生堵塞现象。
    新措施的另一条是进御花园需另购门票。以亭台楼阁、曲池水榭、奇花异石、苍松翠柏取胜的御花园往日成了南来北往的必经之途，游人在这里吃喝坐卧，园内亭损、水污、石缺、松枯。人多竟踩得土地板结，滴水不浸，不少古树已经枯死。庭院深深的御花园如今似乎有点“冷清”。据故宫博物院办公室方国锦主任介绍，收门票后，入园者只有全部游人的１／４，而且多是品味这里的美。
    新规矩产生了新问题。
    门卫诉苦：御花园售票入口处的坤宁门前日日聚满人群，有的踌躇着花２元门票值不值得，有的要求只在门边瞅一瞅，有的则抱怨票贵；更多的人在问路：“不进御花园，怎么出北门？”门卫答：“向东向南，再向东向北。”弄得口枯舌烂。现在打算把售票处挪到比较宽阔的乾清门，还考虑制定新的更加恰当的参观路线。限制人数的结果是收入减少，已向国家要求补贴；还打算在午门建收费停车场和存包处，无非是解决一点经费问题。
    这样做，相信人们是能够理解的。
