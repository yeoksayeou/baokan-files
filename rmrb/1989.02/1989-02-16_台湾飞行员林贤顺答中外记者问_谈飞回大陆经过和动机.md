Taiwanese Air Force Major Lin Xianshun held a press conference for Chinese and foreign journalists today in the Guangdong Welcome Guesthouse. In a cheerful atmosphere, he answered questions of concern to the attendees.

Lin Xianshun briefly introduced the process of his flight back to the mainland. He said, "I took off from Taichung Airport at 9:17 AM on the 11th. The weather in the Taiwan region was good at the time, but after entering the airspace over the mainland, there was a lot of fog, and visibility was low. I couldn't find the Shantou Airport. When I reached the airspace over Fengshun County, my fuel was exhausted, so I had to find a place where I wouldn't harm the lives and property of my compatriots to abandon the plane and parachute."

When asked about the motive for flying back to the mainland, Lin Xianshun replied: "While I was in school, I developed a sense of admiration and longing for the beautiful rivers and mountains of my motherland. Both sides of the Taiwan Strait are Chinese territory, and Taiwan will one day return to the mainland. Therefore, I see this action as my return, just a step ahead."

Regarding the recent series of reports about Lin Xianshun from the Taiwan side, he said, "That's just one side of the story, for reference only. This action was done according to my own will, after repeated consideration, and was not due to 'mental imbalance' or 'a moment of impulsiveness.' I came back to the mainland without ever thinking of gaining any reward. So, knowing that the reward has been abolished, I feel no regret. I just hope I can do my job and serve in the air force."

Lin Xianshun's voice was clear and his spirits were high as he answered the journalists' questions. When asked if he had any message for his family in Taiwan, he happily said, "I have been warmly received on the mainland. Everything I've seen is better than I imagined in Taiwan. If there is an opportunity to visit the beautiful rivers and mountains of my motherland, it is my heart's desire."

　　台湾飞行员林贤顺答中外记者问
    谈飞回大陆经过和动机
    本报广州２月１５日电  记者梁兆明报道：台湾空军中校飞行员林贤顺，今天下午在广东迎宾馆举行中外记者招待会，在欢快的气氛中回答人们关心的问题。
    林贤顺简要介绍了他驾机回大陆的经过。他说，我是１１日上午９时１７分从台中机场驾机起飞的，当时台湾地区天气很好，但飞入大陆地区上空后云雾很大，能见度低，找不到汕头机场。飞至丰顺县上空时油料已燃尽，只好寻找不会伤害同胞生命财产的地方弃机跳伞。
    当记者问及驾机飞回大陆的动机时，林贤顺回答：在校读书时，就对祖国大好河山产生羡慕、向往之情。台湾海峡两边都是中国的领土，台湾终有一日是要回归大陆的，所以我把这次行动理解为我的回归，先走一步而已。
    关于台湾方面近日对林贤顺的一系列报道，他说，那是一面之词，仅供参考好了。我这次行动是依照自己的意愿，经过反复考虑的，决不是什么“心理失去平衡”和“一念之差”。我回大陆，从来未想过获取什么奖金，所以，回到大陆知道已经废除了奖金，我不感到任何遗憾，只希望我能干本行，在空军服务。
    林贤顺在答记者问时声音宏亮，精神奕奕，心情愉快。当记者问及有什么话要对在台湾的亲人讲时，他高兴地说，在大陆我受到热情接待。所见的一切，都比在台湾时想象的要好。如果有机会参观祖国大好河山，是我梦寐以求的。
