Fang Yuan works at the Shanghai Dance Troupe as a director and choreographer. He was once a veteran team leader. In the large-scale dance costume exhibition "Gold Dance, Silver Adornment," there are his masterpieces.

Fang Yuan's talent is undoubtedly reflected in dance directing and choreography. In this field, he is a dedicated practitioner, almost like an ascetic. When the initial draft of a dance drama quietly takes shape, that is his most satisfying and beautiful time. He secludes himself, hanging dozens of his own drawings on the walls, including fragments of character portraits and rough sketches of certain dance scenes from his nighttime dreams and thoughts. He also likes to make various props, which are affectionately called "Fang's Props" by enthusiasts. The materials are nothing more than thick paper and thin wood, with small, skillful hands creating the grandeur of emperors and generals, the tenderness of scholars and beauties, the solemnity of palace walls, and the chaos of contemporary society. In the large-scale dance costume exhibition "Gold Dance, Silver Adornment," the Ming Dynasty scene is where he poured a lot of heart and soul. Look, the stage presents eight theatrical masks, including all the roles of sheng, dan, jing, mo, and chou. He uses this to create a dance atmosphere that is both absurd and humorous, adding exaggeration to break away from a set of trivial, festive dances, making the stage lively and interesting.

Fang Yuan holds an optimistic attitude towards the excellent cultural and artistic heritage of our motherland. His dance aesthetics have undergone new changes in recent years, paying more attention to the essence of dance, that is, the construction of form. The quality of the dance drama "Xue Mei" (co-created with Xian Yu and others) is national, but the expression is modern and open-structured, all derived from traditional opera dance. To highlight the formal beauty of the dance drama, he advocates that the dance style of "Xue Mei" should express a lyrical, freehand style, with imagery pursuing sensibility, and opposing the facialization of character morality.

Fang Yuan's dance aesthetic creation is also reflected in his self-reflection and introspection. He believes that Chinese dance drama is still in its infancy, easily neglecting the architectural consciousness of the overall artistic project, with theoretical deficiencies; in practice, often mistaking an immature model as a rule and treating it as a model. His favorite phrase is: "To create, one must first limit, and then there will be creation." He and another director, Huang Daxing, created dances such as "Surprise Change" and "Awakening," which can be described as honed over a long period. Things often considered as branches sometimes pose a fatal temptation to artists, and it takes great courage to cut them off. This is what he calls "limitation." An artist's talent lies in the ability to limit.

Fang Yuan started from playing drums and performing the Yangge dance. He has entered the golden autumn of his life, but he is still full of ambition. He enjoys a little alcohol, but he does not have much to boast about in terms of alcohol tolerance. Once, he was knocked down by a few cups from his disciples, and I asked him, "How do you feel?" His eyes were blurred with alcohol, but he still murmured, "The future is wonderful beyond words."

　　说方元
    凌耀忠
    方元在上海舞剧院任编导，曾是老资格的一团团长，大型舞蹈服饰展演《金舞银饰》中有他的得意手笔。
    方元的才华无疑表现在舞剧编导方面。在这方垦殖场上，他是一位执著得近乎苦行僧的修炼家。当一部舞剧的最初胚胎悄然凝就，那是他最为自得的美好时光。他关闭自己，四壁悬挂数十幅个人创作的绘图，有一鳞半爪的人物肖像，有纯粹出于夜间梦想冥思草草勾勒的某一舞蹈场面。他还喜欢制作各种道具，好事者称为“方氏道具”。材料不外厚纸薄木，以小巧的手搭出帝王将相的伟岸，才子佳人的缠绵，宫廷深墙的肃穆，当代社会的芜杂骚动。大型舞蹈服饰展演《金舞银饰》中的明朝一场，他倾注了大量心血。瞧，舞台呈现八个戏剧脸谱，举凡戏曲中的生旦净末丑等式式俱全。他以此烘托一种荒诞而谐趣的舞蹈氛围，加以夸张，从而摆脱了一大套琐屑的应景舞蹈，使舞台盎然成趣。
    方元对祖国优秀的文化艺术遗产持乐观态度，他的舞蹈美学思想近年出现了新的嬗变，对舞蹈的本体意识，即形式的建构非常注目。舞剧《雪妹》（和鲜于等合作）的品质是民族性的，表现却是现代的开放性结构，全由戏曲舞蹈衍化而成。为了突出舞剧的形式美，他主张《雪妹》的舞蹈风格宜表达一种抒情的写意性，形象上追求可感性，对人物的道德评价反对脸谱化。
    方元的舞蹈审美创造还表现在他的自审和反思。他认为，我国的舞剧还处于初创阶段，比较容易忽略舞剧艺术总体工程的建筑意识，理论欠丰满；实践上，常常把一点不成熟的模式误认为是规律而奉为楷模。他喜欢的口头禅是：搞创作首先要限制，才会有创造。他和另一编导家黄大星等创作的舞蹈《惊变》、《悟醒》等，可谓磨砺日久，一切被认为是枝蔓的东西有时往往对艺术家构成一种致命的诱惑，斩决它需要很大的勇气。这也就是他称之为“限制”的那种内涵。艺术家的才能就在于善于限制。
    方元是从打腰鼓、扭秧歌走过来的。他已步入人生金秋，但仍然雄心勃勃。他嗜一点酒，但并无足可称道的海量。一次被他的弟子几杯放倒，我问他“感觉如何”？他醉眼矇眬，但却低低应了一句：“未来妙不可言。”
