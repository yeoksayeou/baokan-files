	Professor Dong's Hopes and Concerns
	By Sun Jian, Reporter for This Paper

	There are still a few hours until the New Year's bell rings, and the sound of firecrackers has already filled Nanjing. At this joyous time of bidding farewell to the old and welcoming the new, I knocked on the door of Professor Dong Jian, a professor and vice president of Nanjing University.

	Dong Jian has long been engaged in the study and teaching of contemporary literature and drama. He has compiled and published works such as "Draft of the History of Contemporary Chinese Literature" and "A Study of Chen Bichen's Creative Process." He is one of the outstanding middle-aged teachers in the Chinese Department of Nanjing University and was promoted to vice president in October last year, overseeing the liberal arts education of the entire school.

	I got straight to the point and asked him to talk about what he is satisfied and dissatisfied with on this New Year's Eve. He exhaled a puff of smoke and slowly said, "The most satisfying thing is that the academic environment has changed, political pressure has been reduced, and one can freely express different opinions and publish academic articles with different viewpoints."

	His wife, Associate Professor Hua Yu, interjected, "In the past few years, the school has also sent a large number of students and scholars abroad for study and further education. They have achieved great success in their studies."

	Vice President Dong continued, "Intellectuals are the most supportive of reform. The discussion on the criterion of truth in practice, the criticism of the 'two whatevers,' intellectuals have always been at the forefront. Ten years of reform have brought hope to China's intellectuals. No one wants to regress to the era ten years ago. But how to proceed from here, I am not quite sure." He changed the subject seriously, "The greatest wish of intellectuals is to accelerate political system reform, to be more open and democratic; to overcome the bureaucratic mindset, and not to equate professors and associate professors with administrative ranks. This will lead to mutual comparison and loss of confidence. There is an even more important point, which is to rebuild our national spirit. Western civilization emphasizes the individual and interests, while our country has always emphasized the group and ideals. Only by organically combining the essence of both cultures can we form a modern national spirit. The backwardness of a country is not only reflected in the economy, but the emptiness of thought is also very frightening."

　　董教授的希望与忧虑
    本报记者　孙健
    距新年的钟声还有数小时，南京城早已爆竹声声。在这千家万户除旧迎新的喜庆时分，我叩开了南京大学教授、副校长董健的家门。
    董健教授长期从事当代文学、戏剧研究与教学工作、编著出版过《中国当代文学史初稿》、《陈白尘创作历程论》等著作，是南大中文系出类拔萃的中年教师之一，去年１０月被提拔为副校长，分管全校文科教学工作。
    我开门见山，请他在除夕之夜谈点满意和不满意的事情。他吐出一缕青烟缓缓地说：“最满意的是学术环境改变了，政治压力减轻了，可以自由地发表不同意见，发表不同观点的学术文章。”
    他的夫人华瑜副教授在一旁插话说：“这几年学校还派出大批留学生、进修生到国外学习、进修，他们在学业上取得了很大的成就。”
    董校长继续说下去：“知识分子是最支持改革的，实践检验真理标准的讨论，批判‘两个凡是’，知识分子总是走在前面的，十年改革给中国的知识分子带来希望，谁也不希望倒退到十年前那样的年代。但往后如何走心中不太有数。”他话锋一转神态认真地说，“知识分子最大的心愿就是希望加快政治体制改革，更加开放和民主；克服官本位思想，不要再搞什么教授、副教授相当于行政什么级，这样会造成互相攀比，使人失去信心。还有更重要的一点就是重建我们的民族精神，西方文明强调个人、强调利益，而我国则一直强调群体，强调理想，只有使两种文化的精华有机结合，才能形成现代化的民族精神。一个国家的落后不仅表现在经济上，思想上的空虚也是很可怕的。”
