U.S. President Bush delivered his first address to a joint session of Congress on February 9, the same day the White House released the new administration's first budget plan for the 1990 fiscal year. The tone of the speech and the new budget was to "make America better." It seems that this expresses Bush's government's desire to add a new chapter to American history.

Bush's speech to Congress, like his inauguration speech three weeks earlier, was filled with an optimistic atmosphere. He told the legislators, "We must govern America better." To do this, we must deal with some very real problems, set very clear priorities, and significantly reduce the federal budget deficit. Bush presented to Congress what he believed to be the best and most realistic plan, which can be summarized as: maintaining America's technological leadership, increasing long-term investment, improving the education system, raising productivity, and increasing funding for scientific research, education, anti-drug efforts, environmental protection, child welfare, and medical assistance. In terms of capital gains, he proposed lowering tax rates to promote scientific research and education, improve national cultural health, encourage personal investment, and enhance America's competitiveness. American newspapers believe that this is the first time Bush has presented a "broad outline of domestic policy" to the public.

However, the reality facing the new president is also grim. Although Bush's first state of the union address could not avoid discussing foreign policy, it was relatively brief and general. The majority of the speech focused on domestic issues, especially on reducing the budget deficit, because without solving the deficit problem, Bush's blueprint and aspirations would be difficult to implement. Bush clearly told Congress that there are many areas where everyone hopes to increase spending, but we cannot. We must first "get our finances in order."

Currently, the budget is the number one problem in the United States. On one hand, annual expenditures are enormous, and on the other hand, revenues are insufficient, leading to a growing deficit. The deficit in the 1980s expanded rapidly, reaching a peak of over $220 billion in 1986. The White House's budget office estimates that the fiscal deficit for this year (1989) will still be $170.2 billion. How to reduce the deficit has become a difficult problem for the U.S. government every year.

According to the budget balance law passed by Congress three years ago, the fiscal deficit for the 1990 fiscal year cannot exceed $100 billion. The primary task facing the Bush administration is to reduce the deficit by 40% within a year, which is obviously not an easy task. According to the new budget released by the White House, the total fiscal revenue for the 1990 fiscal year is $1,065.6 billion, an increase of only $800 million from the current year. This means that the new administration has limited financial resources and little room for maneuver. Therefore, the new budget must address the problem of significantly reducing the deficit, which inevitably requires a corresponding reduction in expenditures. Since revenue increases are limited, the funds that Bush proposed for his work priorities and "key projects" will be very limited. Therefore, in a certain period, Bush's steps towards realizing his aspirations may not be very large.

From another perspective, to tighten expenditures, Bush has already proposed freezing military spending for one year, which saves $2.6 billion more than Reagan's budget proposal on January 9. For other domestic projects, except for legally mandated social security and debt interest payments, most will also be frozen. The new budget proposes a set of choices within the range of determined expenditures, with details to be negotiated with Congress. On the budget issue, Bush also proposed some new initiatives to Congress, such as his request for Congress to pass a constitutional amendment to achieve a balanced budget, which would bind both Congress and the government. He also advocates for Congress and the government to work together to form a leadership team, sincerely consult, and determine a budget to reduce the deficit. More innovatively, he emphasizes that in federal projects, expenditures do not necessarily have to exceed inflation, and all expenditure items are not destined to be eternal. It seems that facing the annual budget problem, Bush also wants to break some old conventions and find new ways.

However, the grim reality of the budget problem is a long-term accumulation, and Bush's government's desire to change reality is also unlikely to be achieved overnight. Moreover, after the new budget was released, various opinions emerged. Some said it was too vague, making it unclear where the deficit would be reduced, and Congress could not negotiate; others said the government's assessment of the economic situation was too optimistic. As for the specific increase or decrease in funds for each project, as the New York Times said, "The bargaining has just begun," and Bush's blueprint and aspirations will face the test of reality.

　　布什的愿望与预算的现实
    本报记者  张启昕
    美国总统布什２月９日向国会联席会议发表了他任职以来的第一次演说，同一天白宫公布了新政府的第一个预算计划——１９９０财政年度预算。这次演说和新预算的基调是“把美国建设得更好”。看来，这表达了布什政府想为美国历史增添新一页的愿望。
    布什在国会的演说，如同他三周前在宣誓仪式上的就职演说，充满乐观的气氛。他对议员们说，“我们必须把美国治理得更好”。为此，必须处理一些非常现实的问题，确立十分明确的重点，同时大幅度地把联邦预算赤字削减下来。布什向国会提出了他认为最好的而又现实的计划，概括起来就是：保持美国科技的领先地位，增加长期投资，改善教育制度，提高生产率，在科研、教育、反毒、环保、关心儿童、实行医疗援助等方面增加拨款，在资本收益方面降低税率，以此促进科研教育，提高民族文化健康水平，鼓励个人投资，增强美国的竞争力。美国报纸认为，这是布什总统首次向公众亮出的“广泛的国内政策的蓝图”。
    然而，新总统面对的现实也是严峻的。布什的首次施政演说虽然不能不论及外交问题，但相对而言，比较概括简略。演说的大部分集中在国内问题上，特别是在削减预算赤字问题上，因为预算赤字问题不解决，布什政府的蓝图和愿望也难付诸行动。布什明白地对国会说，有许多领域，大家都希望多给一些开支，但是我们不能够，我们先得“把我们的财政整顿好”。
    目前，财政预算是美国国内的头号难题，一方面历年的财政开支庞大，另一方面则是入不敷出，赤字日积月累，数额十分惊人。８０年代财政赤字更是急剧膨胀，１９８６年达到高峰，超过２２００亿美元，白宫的预算局预计本年度（１９８９年度）的财政赤字仍将达１７０２亿美元。如何缩减赤字，成了美国政府每年碰到的难题。
    根据三年前国会通过的预算平衡法，１９９０年财政年度的预算赤字不能超过１０００亿美元的限额，布什政府面临的首要任务就是要在一年内把赤字从现有水平缩小４０％，这显然不是件轻而易举的事。据白宫公布的新预算，１９９０年度财政总收入为１０６５６亿美元，比本年度只增加８００多亿美元，这对新政府来说，财力仍然有限，活动的余地不大。因此新预算要对付的问题是：大幅度缩减赤字，势必要相应紧缩开支；收入增加得不多，布什提出的工作重点和“关键项目”所能增加的经费就极有限，因而在一个时期里，布什在实现自己的愿望上，迈出的步子似不可能很大。
    从另一方面看，为了紧缩开支布什已主动提出冻结军费一年，这比里根１月９日提出的预算方案节省２６亿美元。对于国内其他项目，除法定不能减少的社会保险和支付债息等之外，大多也将采取冻结的办法。新预算在确定开支总数的范围内提出了一套选择，细节还待同国会磋商。在预算问题上，布什也向国会提出了一些新主张，例如他要求国会通过一项实现平衡预算的宪法修正案，对国会和政府具有同样的约束。他还主张国会与政府通力合作，组成一个领导班子，真诚协商，确定一个降低赤字的预算。更有新意的是他针对高消费的通病，强调联邦项目中，开支的增长并不非要超过通货膨胀，所有的开支项目也不是注定永恒的。看来，面对年复一年的预算难题，布什也想冲破一些旧的常规，寻找新的路子。
    然而，预算问题的严峻现实是长期积累而成的，布什政府想要改变现实的愿望也不大可能一朝一夕就能实现。再说新预算公布之后，各方议论纷纭，有的说它太含混，弄不清赤字从哪里减少，国会无法协商；有的说政府对经济形势估计过于乐观。至于具体项目的经费增减，正如《纽约时报》所说，“讨价还价还刚开头”，布什的蓝图和愿望都将面临现实的考验。
