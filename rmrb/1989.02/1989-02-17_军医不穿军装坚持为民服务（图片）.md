After removing their military uniforms and becoming civilians, should they still enthusiastically serve the people? The young doctors of the Internal Medicine Department of the 31st Hospital of the Lanzhou Military Region have answered this question with their actions. They still carry their medical bags, ride their bicycles, and go from village to village, persistently providing medical services to the elderly and disabled in the local area. The picture shows Nurse Long Wei examining an epilepsy patient in Shibadahe Township, Baoji City. Photographed by Sun Hengzhi.

    军医不穿军装坚持为民服务
    脱军装、改文职后，还要不要热情为民服务？兰州军区第31医院内科的青年们用行动作出了回答。他们仍背上药箱，骑上自行车，走乡串户，坚持为驻地孤寡老人、行走不便的病人送医上门。图为护士长魏卫在宝鸡市石坝河乡给一癫痫病患者复查。孙恒志摄
