Title: The Backpacks of Primary School Students Are Too Heavy

	“Little boy, little boy, carrying a heavy backpack to school, the backpack weighs five or six pounds, it's really burdensome…” This is a song currently popular among some primary school students in Kaifeng City, which they have adapted themselves.

	According to the Kaifeng City Urban Sample Survey Team, a student just starting school has to pay over 20 yuan for textbooks in the first semester alone, receiving about 20 books. Adding supplementary materials such as “Character Learning,” “Pronunciation of Mandarin Phonetics,” “Game Learning Cards,” “Extracurricular Activities,” and “Extracurricular Reading,” there are nearly 30 kinds. Several dozen books, along with notebooks and stationery, weigh about five or six pounds. Some parents cannot bear to see their six or seven-year-old children carrying such heavy backpacks, walking crookedly to school, so they have to send them to school and pick them up after class.

	The large number of books issued to lower-grade students and the heavy learning burden not only bother parents but also make teachers feel uncomfortable. They say that the reading and comprehension abilities of lower-grade students are still poor. In the past, only essential textbooks like “Language” and “Mathematics” were issued. Now, with so many books issued to students to be completed in one semester, even force-feeding would not be enough.

	According to the reporter’s understanding, the phenomenon of primary school students receiving many books and having a heavy learning burden exists in many places throughout the province. The main reason is that printing primary school textbooks results in a loss, and factories, in order to make up for the deficit, try every means to print more high-priced supplementary learning materials and sell them to the education department along with the main textbooks. Schools distribute these numerous supplementary learning materials to students. If they do not teach them at all, they cannot explain it to the parents, so they pressure the subject teachers to increase class hours or teaching content, making primary school students busy with homework all day.

	This practice of spending money to give children a hard time without seeking practical results has caused dissatisfaction among many parents and teachers. They eagerly hope that relevant departments will take measures to stop this, to reduce the excessive learning burden on primary school students and the unnecessary economic expenditure of families.

### 小学生的书包太重了

　　小学生的书包太重了
    “小呀小儿郎啊，背着书包上学堂，书包五六斤，实在压的慌……”这是目前在开封市一些小学生中流行的一首自己改编的歌曲。
    据开封市城市抽样调查队调查，一个刚入学的小学生，第一个学期光交书本费就得２０多元，发书２０余本，再加上《生字》、《普通话音节》、《游戏》学习卡片、《课外活动》、《课外阅读》等辅助教材，就有近３０种。几十本书加上作业本和文具盒之类的东西，共有五六斤重，一些家长不忍看着六七岁的孩子背着如此沉重的书包，一扭一歪地去上学，只好上学送，放学接。
    低年级小学生发书之多、学习负担之重，不仅家长有意见，连老师也过意不去。他们说，低年级小学生阅读和理解能力还很差，过去只发《语文》、《数学》等必备课本，而现在发这么多书让学生在一个学期内学完，就是“填鸭”也来不及。
    据记者了解，小学生发书多、学习负担重的现象，在全省不少地方都存在。究其原因，主要是印刷小学课本亏本，工厂为了弥补亏损，就想方设法多印些售价较高的辅助性学习材料，连同主课本一起卖给教育部门。学校把如此众多搭配来的各种辅助性学习材料发给学生，如果一点不教，也不好向家长们交待，只好压着任课老师增加课时或增加授课内容，使小学生一天到晚忙于做作业。
    这种不求实际、花钱给孩子买“罪”受的作法，引起许多家长和老师的不满，他们殷切希望有关部门采取措施予以制止，以减轻小学生过重的学习负担和家庭不必要的经济开支。
