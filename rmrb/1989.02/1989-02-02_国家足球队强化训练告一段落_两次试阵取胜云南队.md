The national football team, led by Gao Fengwen, arrived in Guangzhou today from Kunming. They will depart for Hong Kong on February 4 to participate in the Lunar New Year Cup football tournament held during the Spring Festival.

The national team began winter training in Kunming on January 5, with adjustments made to the roster and lineup. The training in Kunming was an intensive, high-volume preparation for the World Cup qualifiers. The team members conducted technical and tactical training in the morning and ran in strong winds of six to seven levels in the afternoon to build endurance and strength, almost every day. It is understood that the players trained very actively, and the winter training achieved the expected results.

To test the effectiveness of the winter training, the national team played two public matches against the Yunnan team on January 22 and 29. In the first match, the Yunnan team scored first in the first half, breaking through the national team's goal defended by Shi Lianzhi, leading 1-0. In the second half, the national team adjusted their lineup, with captain Zhang Huikang in goal, and accelerated their offensive pace, eventually scoring three goals to win 3-1.

A week later, the national team faced the Yunnan team again. In the first half, the national team deployed a 4-3-3 formation, with Guo Yijun as the attacking midfielder, coordinating with Wu Qunli, Liu Haiguang, and Wang Baoshan, significantly enhancing their offensive capabilities. Liu Haiguang and Wang Baoshan scored goals in the first half, leading 2-0. In the second half, they switched to a 4-4-2 formation but did not expand the lead.

The 18 players who will travel to Hong Kong for the Lunar New Year Cup are: goalkeepers Zhang Huikang and Shi Lianzhi, defenders Zhang Xiaowen, Zhu Bo, Dong Liquang, Gao Sheng, Jia Xiuquan, and Mai Chao, midfielders Duan Ju, Tang Yaodong, Xie Yuxin, Guo Yijun, and Sun Xianlu, and forwards Wu Qunli, Ma Lin, Liu Haiguang, Wang Baoshan, and Tu Shengqiao. However, this is not the final lineup for the World Cup qualifiers.

At 3:30 PM on February 2, the national team will play a Tianmei Cup welcome football match against the Guangdong team at the Yuexiu Mountain Sports Stadium in Guangzhou.

　　国家足球队强化训练告一段落
    两次试阵取胜云南队
    本报广州２月１日电  由高丰文率领的国家足球队今天自昆明飞抵广州。他们将于２月４日赴香港，参加春节期间举行的贺岁杯足球赛。
    国家队是１月５日起在昆明集结冬训的，人选和阵容有所调整。昆明的集训是备战世界杯外围赛的大运动量强化训练，国家队队员们上午作技、战术训练，下午冒六七级大风奔跑，练体能和力量，几乎日日如是。据了解，队员们训练都很积极，冬训达到了预期的目的。
    为检验冬训效果，国家队在１月２２日和２９日先后与云南队作两场公开赛。首战，云南队上半场率先攻破由施连志把守的国家队大门，以１∶０领先。下半时，国家队调整阵容，派出主将张惠康把关，并加快了进攻节奏，最后连扳３分，以３∶１得胜。
    一周后，国家队与云南队再度交锋。上半时国家队排出四三三阵式，由郭亿军出任攻击前卫，与吴群立、柳海光、王宝山相呼应，攻击力明显加强。上半时即由柳海光、王宝山先后破门，以２∶０领先。下半时改打四四二阵式，但未能扩大战果。
    国家队赴港踢贺岁杯赛的１８员战将是：守门员张惠康、施连志，后卫张小文、朱波、董礼强、高升、贾秀全、麦超，前卫段举、唐尧东、谢育新、郭亿军、孙贤禄，前锋吴群立、马林、柳海光、王宝山、涂胜桥。然而，这并不是中国队出赛世界杯外围赛的最后人选。
    ２月２日下午三时半，国家队将在广州越秀山体育场与广东队进行一场天美杯迎春足球赛。
