Among animals, snakes are not particularly endearing, but from ancient times, snakes seem to have had a close relationship with humans. In Hebrew mythology, wasn't it a snake that tempted the ancestors of humanity, Adam and Eve, to eat the forbidden fruit, leading them to understand desire and shame, and be expelled from paradise, thus beginning human life? Most primitive beliefs regard snakes as symbols of reproduction. Ancient Chinese stone carvings depict Fu Xi and Nu Wa with human heads and serpent bodies, embracing each other. However, later on, people generally disliked snakes, except for some southerners who consider snakes a delicacy or use them as medicine.

Snakes also became the embodiment of dragons. People born in the Year of the Snake often say they are little dragons. Dragons are mythical creatures, and their image is similar to that of snakes. No one has seen a dragon in modern times. In ancient times, people's impressions of dragons might have been related to extinct giant reptiles. During the Spring and Autumn period, people still claimed to have seen dragons, which might have been large snakes or remnants of dinosaur-like creatures in ancient marshes in the north. In any case, after the Warring States period, no one saw dragons again. Later, people who claimed to have seen dragons were actually seeing snakes. The story of Emperor Gaozu of the Han Dynasty slaying a snake is an example; at that time, people said he had slain a white snake, which was a symbol of the Qin Dynasty, a white dragon. In the past, farmers would pray for rain by offering a small snake. Therefore, snakes and dragons can be considered one and the same. The Year of the Dragon is followed by the Year of the Snake, and their relationship is inseparable.

In many Chinese idioms, people generally have a negative impression of snakes. Here are a few examples: "The boa constrictor swallowing an elephant" refers to insatiable greed; "A tiger's head and a snake's tail" refers to a grand beginning but lacking endurance; "Stirring up snakes in the grass" implies that snakes are bad objects that should be struck; "Seeing snakes in the cup and shadows of bows" refers to snakes being considered poisonous, not health-giving wine; "A venomous woman" refers to a woman who is beautiful but has a cruel heart. However, a snake turning into a woman, and this snake-turned-woman being a positive character, is a unique creation in Chinese mythology.

Everyone knows the story of "The Legend of the White Snake" in Peking Opera. This story tells of a white snake transforming into a woman named Bai Suzhen, known as the White Lady. Bai Suzhen and Xu Xian fell in love, and she fought a great battle with a monk named Fa Hai, flooding the Golden Mountain to save Xu Xian. Later, Bai Suzhen was subdued by Fa Hai's magical artifact and pressed under the Leifeng Pagoda in Hangzhou until the pagoda collapsed, allowing Bai Suzhen to escape. This story was widely circulated in Hangzhou during the Southern Song Dynasty, but it actually originated from the Near East. In the 3rd or 4th century, a Greek writer named Philostratus wrote a biography of a wandering sage named Apollonius. This sage's deeds were similar to those attributed to Jesus Christ, and their timelines were also close. It seems that in the period before and after the birth of Christ, there were similar figures in the Near East. This biography mentions a story of a demon snake turning into a woman. This demon was called Lamia, and it transformed into a woman to live with a man. A sage with magical powers discovered her true form but failed to stop her, and the man was eventually eaten by the snake. This story later spread to Europe. The British romantic poet Keats wrote an unfinished narrative poem called "Lamia." This story likely spread to China during the Tang and Song dynasties. Hangzhou was then a center for foreign trade, and the story was probably brought over by sailors or merchants from the Near East.

Initially, the Chinese story of "The Legend of the White Snake" also portrayed the snake-turned Bai Suzhen as a malevolent demon. In the Song and Yuan dynasty story "Bai Suzhen Permanently Sealed Under Leifeng Pagoda," the monk Fa Hai with magical powers was still a positive character, and Bai Suzhen's fate was considered just. However, in later Ming and Qing dynasty operas and dramas, the story changed. Initially, in the opera, "The Legend of the White Snake" was called "The Tale of the Righteous Demon," where Bai Suzhen, though a demon, was still righteous and worthy of sympathy. Later, people began to curse the orthodox monk Fa Hai and praise Bai Suzhen, turning this snake-turned-woman into a symbol of resistance against feudal oppression. Today, who wouldn't hope for Bai Suzhen to flood the Golden Mountain and defeat Fa Hai when watching the Peking Opera "The Legend of the White Snake" and hearing her sing "Breaking out of the Golden Mountain Temple, anger like a blazing fire"?

In the past, Lu Xun wrote about the collapse of Leifeng Pagoda in his early essays, praising the snake-turned Bai Suzhen. He also mentioned that in his childhood, he heard people from Shaoxing say that Fa Hai was defeated by Bai Suzhen and fled into a crab shell. When people eat crabs, they find a piece of inedible crab meat in the belly, shaped like a cowering monk, which is Fa Hai. Lu Xun commented, "Serves him right!" The poet Tian Han also adapted the Peking Opera "The Legend of the White Snake," strengthening its spirit of resistance against feudal oppression. All of this added luster to the snake. Today, we can use the snake as a symbol of the Chinese people's spirit of resisting feudalism over the past few hundred years.

As a new Year of the Snake approaches, let us take it as a new beginning for our struggle against feudalism. Over the past few hundred years, China's struggle against feudalism has achieved great results, but the struggle is far from over. In many aspects, the remnants of feudal forces are still rampant and require our continued efforts to completely defeat them. This will probably take many more years. The body and movement of a snake are winding and curved. In our forward march, the struggle between progressive forces and feudal forces will not be smooth sailing and will surely encounter many twists and turns, probably requiring us to walk several "zigzags." The next Year of the Snake is 2001, which is the end of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century. As we celebrate the Spring Festival, let us wish for a prosperous Year of the Snake and hope to complete our mission of resisting feudalism between the two Years of the Snake.

### 蛇年谈蛇

    蛇年谈蛇
    杨宪益
    在动物中，蛇不是个讨人喜欢的东西，但是从原始时代起，蛇似乎就同人有密切关系。在希伯莱神话中，不就是蛇引诱了人类的祖先亚当和夏娃，使他们吃了禁果，懂得了情欲和羞耻，而被赶出天堂，开始了人的生活吗？一般原始信仰都以蛇为生殖的象征，中国古代石刻也有伏羲和女娲人首蛇身而相互拥抱的形象。不过后来人一般都讨厌蛇，只有南方一些人拿蛇当作好吃的美味，或者作为药物服用。
    蛇又成为龙的化身。现在人生在蛇年的，往往说自己生属是小龙，本来龙就是个神话动物，形象同蛇差不多，现代人谁也没有见过龙。在远古时代，人对龙的传说印象也许与古代早已灭种的大爬虫类动物有关，春秋时人还有说见过龙的，那也许只是大蛇，或者古代北方某些沼泽地带还有残余的恐龙类动物。反正战国以后就没有人见过龙了。后来人说见到的龙都是蛇。汉高祖有斩蛇的故事，当时人就说他斩的白蛇是秦朝的象征，是条白龙。过去农民天旱求水，往往拿一条小蛇来供养。所以蛇与龙可以说就是一回事。龙年过了就是蛇年，二者关系是不可细分的。
    在中国的许多过去成语里，人民对蛇都没有多少好印象。随便举几个例子：“巴蛇吞象”是说人贪心不足；“虎头蛇尾”是说开头气派大而缺乏后劲；
  “打草惊蛇”，蛇被认为是应该打击的坏对象；“杯弓蛇影”里的蛇也被认为是毒物，并不是健身的药酒；“蛇蝎美人”是说心肠狠毒而外表漂亮的女人等等。但蛇变女人，而这个蛇变的女人又是一个正面人物，这倒是中国的神话传说里的一大发明创造。
    大家都知道京剧白蛇传这段故事。这段故事讲一条白蛇变了一个女人，名白素贞，人称白娘子。白娘子与许仙相亲相爱，曾与一个叫法海的正统派和尚大战，水漫金山，救回许仙，后来白娘子被法海用法宝镇住，压在杭州的雷峰塔下，一直到雷峰塔倒塌，白娘子才得逃出。这段故事在南宋杭州广泛流传，实际上它是一个外来的故事，并不是起源于南宋的杭州，而是起源于近东。公元三四世纪间的一个希腊作家菲洛斯特拉屠斯写过一本关于一个游方道士名叫阿波罗尼奥斯的传记。这个方士的事迹同相传为耶稣基督的差不多，年代也差不多，看来在公元前后那一段时期，近东一带类似的人还不止一个。这本传记里说起当时流传一个妖蛇变女人的故事。这个妖怪叫做拉米亚，它变成女人，与一个男子相爱同居，有一个有道术的方士发现她是妖怪，曾想拦阻，但好像没有成功，那个男子终于被变回蛇形的妖怪吃掉了。这个故事后来传到欧洲。英国的浪漫主义诗人济慈就曾写过一个名为“拉米亚”的叙事长诗，不过诗没有写完。这个故事传到中国大概是唐宋时期的事。杭州当时是中外通商的一个中心，故事大概就是近东方面的水手或商人传过来的。
      中国的白蛇传故事开始也是把蛇变的白娘子当作不怀好意的妖精看待的。在宋元话本里的“白娘子永镇雷峰塔”故事里，有道术的法海和尚就还是正面人物，而白娘子的下场也还是被认为罪有应得，但在后来的明清戏曲传奇里就不一样了。开头在戏曲里白蛇传被称为“义妖传”，白娘子虽是蛇变的妖精，但还很有义气，值得同情。再后来人民就都咒骂那维持正统的法海和尚，歌颂白娘子，把这个蛇变的女人当作反对封建压迫的象征了。今天有谁看京戏白蛇传，听白娘子唱出“杀出了金山寺怒如烈火”时，不希望她水漫金山，打败法海和尚的么？
    鲁迅过去在他的早期杂文里也写过雷峰塔的倒塌，称赞过蛇变的白娘子的话。他还特别提到在他幼年就听到过绍兴一带人民说法海被白娘子打败，逃到螃蟹壳里躲起来了，人们吃螃蟹，剥开蟹肚脐，就可以找到一块不能吃的蟹肉，状似畏缩潜藏的和尚，那就是法海。鲁迅因此评曰：“活该！”诗人田汉也曾改编过京戏白蛇传，加强了这出戏的反对封建压迫精神。这些都给蛇增加了光采。我们今天正可以拿蛇作为中国人民近几百年来反封建精神的象征。
    在此一个新的蛇年来临之际，让我们拿它作为一个新的反封建斗争的开始。中国近几百年来，反对封建主义的斗争，已经作出了很大的成绩，但是斗争远未结束，在许多方面，残余的封建势力还很猖狂，还需要我们继续努力，才能够把它完全打垮，这大概还要用许多年的时间。蛇的身体和行走是弯弯曲曲的。在我们前进的道路上，进步力量反对封建力量的斗争也不会是一帆风顺的，总要经过许多曲折，大概还要走好几个“之”字。下一个蛇年是2001年，那正是公元二十世纪终了，二十一世纪开始的时候。在欢度春节中，让我们预祝蛇年大吉大利，预祝在两个蛇年之间完成我们的反封建使命吧。
