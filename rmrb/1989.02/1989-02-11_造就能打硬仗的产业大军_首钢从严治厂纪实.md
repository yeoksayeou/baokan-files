Shougang's strict management is well-known in the business world.

Shougang's "strictness" is reflected in the execution of rules and regulations, adhering to the "three 100%": rules and regulations must be 100% implemented, violations must be 100% recorded and reported, and violators must have 100% of their monthly bonuses deducted. For serious violations that cause significant losses, 1 to 3 months' bonuses will be deducted, and administrative penalties or criminal charges may be pursued.

The reporter witnessed several stories about the "three 100%" at Shougang:

The foreman of the Second Construction Team, Jiaoyan Zhi, was off duty and passed by the No. 1 substation of the steelmaking plant. He noticed that a safety propaganda board that was previously hung up was about to fall off, so he climbed onto the frame to secure it. The safety officer saw this and criticized him for not wearing a safety belt. He immediately accepted the criticism, found a safety belt, and secured it before hanging up the propaganda board. The next day, he voluntarily filled out a violation report.

Maoyin Zhang, who was on night duty at the acetylene station of the repair plant's mobile workshop, returned to his post after smoking in the adjacent smoking room and found that the water tank was already full. He immediately took decisive action to prevent an accident, with no losses incurred. At the time, only he was present, but the next day he voluntarily reported to the leadership and filled out a violation report.

Wang Ruolian, who was then the Party Secretary of the Wire Rod Mill, agreed to have the factory's small car driver pick him up at the front gate of the subway station at 8 AM the next day to go to the factory's western area (Guang'anmen) to give a party lesson to the party members. Due to unclear instructions, the car did not arrive on time. He immediately took a taxi at his own expense to get there, but was still 15 minutes late. Wang Ruolian first made a self-criticism to the party members and then filled out a violation report upon returning to the factory.

If the above examples seem ordinary, then the unexpected power outage on June 22, 1986, strongly demonstrates that Shougang has cultivated an industrial army with good work ethic and excellent technical skills through strict management.

At 1:52 AM that day, due to an operational error by the staff on duty at the Shijingshan Power Plant, the Shougang factory area suddenly experienced a power outage. In an instant, the ten-mile steel city was plunged into darkness, and 9,402 electric motors stopped running. Blast furnaces, converters, heating furnaces, sintering machines, rolling mills, oxygen generators, and 748 other pieces of equipment were paralyzed. Dispatching was forced to stop due to phone outages, and trains had to brake suddenly due to the lack of signals. More urgently, the blast furnace bodies would be damaged due to the stoppage of cooling water, and unpressurized coal gas pipelines would enter the air and cause explosions... There were even more worrying things: 10,000-plus workers on duty were participating in rescue and obstacle removal operations. If even one person made an operational error, it could trigger a disaster!

However, Shougang's workers were already familiar with their responsibilities and accustomed to strictly following rules and regulations. Coupled with the regular accident simulations and anti-accident drills, everyone had mastered the operational techniques and the ability to handle unexpected accidents. For example, Li Tianyin, the foreman of the No. 3 blast furnace, noticed the flickering of the lights and immediately judged that a major power outage was imminent. He decided to tap the iron early, reducing the pressure inside the furnace and minimizing the losses caused by the power outage. The operators in the control room of the oxygen plant heard the abnormal sound of the equipment running and accurately judged that a power outage was imminent. They immediately opened the pressure relief valve of the oxygen generator to reduce pressure, thus protecting the equipment. The workers in the pipeline section of the power plant ran in the dark and climbed up the coal gas pipeline, which was tens of meters high, and opened the coal gas relief valve and steam pressure maintenance equipment in just a few minutes, ensuring the safety of the coal gas pipeline. The workers at the heating furnace station of the second wire rod mill closed 28 valves on the air supply and coal gas pipelines in less than 3 minutes in the dark, releasing the residual coal gas in the pipelines, and opened the emergency water source for the large furnace to continue cooling. The workers in the casting workshop of the foundry, to prevent the iron melting furnace filled with molten iron from being burned through, not only poured out the molten iron in the dark but also lined up to use buckets and basins to pour water on the red-hot furnace walls, cooling the iron melting furnace. The rolling workers in the roughing mill quickly used gas welding to cut the red steel stopped in the rolling mill and jammed in the roller table, and then used hammers to remove it piece by piece... Through such accurate operations and decisive handling, not only was not a single piece of equipment damaged, but no one was injured. In the face of this sudden test, people saw the tremendous power of Shougang's contract responsibility system and strict management!

Shougang's achievements in strict management were hard-won. Initially, when the "three 100%" were first introduced, there was a chorus of opposition from top to bottom. Some department-level cadres would sneer, "The court sentences criminals, and there's still a policy of leniency for those who confess! A worker violates factory rules or has a minor accident, and if they confess 100%, their monthly bonus is still deducted 100%. This is a bit too inhumane!" Some technical cadres also said, "Implementing the three 100% without distinction is unfair! Without distinction, there is no policy!" Among the workers, there were even more complaints of "too strict assessment" and "too harsh deductions," and some even cursed Zhou Guanwu for being "heartless." Faced with this situation, Zhou Guanwu and other company leaders did not soften their hearts, mouths, or hands. On the one hand, they reasoned with facts and guided emotions, making everyone realize that implementing rules and regulations 100% is a major matter for protecting and developing productivity; on the other hand, they put forward the issue of whether the company needed the "three 100%" as a proposal and submitted it to the company's congress for discussion. After the congress formed a resolution, they resolutely fought against the "good personism" of leaders at all levels: those who dared not or were unwilling to manage and assess strictly, or to reward and punish strictly, were either transferred, dismissed, or penalized, without mercy. They dared to do this because they were convinced that under the contract responsibility system, strict management was not only necessary but also completely possible. Because in the past, the interests of the state, the enterprise, and the individual were not linked, workers lacked labor enthusiasm, and even if they wanted to be strict, they couldn't. After the contract, the workers' interests were closely linked with the economic benefits of the enterprise. If the assessment was not strict, the enterprise was lax, accidents piled up, production tasks were not completed, and the enterprise's benefits did not go up, not only would the state not be able to collect more, and the enterprise not be able to retain more, but individual interests would also suffer. It was precisely the interest mechanism of the contract responsibility system, coupled with in-depth ideological and political work, that made adherence to laws and regulations a voluntary action for Shougang people. Moreover, even the cadres and workers of the 13 military enterprises that had recently been merged into Shougang began to regulate their behavior according to the "three 100%." For example, in the Jilin Diesel Engine Factory, the following incidents occurred:

The deputy secretary of the factory party committee, Yang Xuefang, found that there was an omission in the materials reported by a department she was in charge of, so she took responsibility and deducted her own monthly bonus and reported it to the entire factory;

The deputy director of the supply department was late for work by 5 minutes because he was accompanying a guest, and was reported for violating regulations;

The new director of the gear factory, on his first day of taking office, found that workers in his factory had the phenomenon of leaving early, so he posted a "self-criticism" in the factory and deducted his own monthly bonus;

A young worker in the Nanling Sub-factory, Zhang Jieyu, was on night duty. Before leaving home, he found that his bicycle tire had been punctured. To avoid being late, he spent 15 yuan to take a taxi to get to the factory ahead of time...

Someone once predicted: The lazy, careless, and makeshift habits of state-owned enterprises are "inherited" and "incurable"! Those who hold this view, if they have the time to visit Shougang, might draw a new conclusion.

　　造就能打硬仗的产业大军
    ——首钢从严治厂纪实
    本报记者  江世杰
    首钢从严治厂在企业界是很有名的。
    首钢的“严”，体现在执行规章制度坚持“三个１００％”上，即规章制度必须１００％地贯彻执行，违规违制必须１００％地登记上报，违规违制者必须１００％地扣除当月全部奖金。其中，严重违规违制造成重大损失者，要扣除１—３个月奖金，直到给予行政处分，追究刑事责任。
    记者在首钢耳闻目睹了不少关于“三个１００％”的故事：
    二建二队作业队长焦延智，下班路经炼钢１号变电所，看到原先挂好的一块安全宣传牌快掉下来了，便爬到架子上加固。安全员看到后批评他未系安全带，他立即接受批评，找来安全带系好后又上去挂好了宣传牌。第二天他却主动填报了违规违制表。
    修理厂机动科乙炔站姚银章值夜班，到隔壁吸烟室吸烟返回岗位时，发现上水罐已经注满，立即果断处理，避免了事故，没有造成任何损失。当时在场的只有他一人，可第二天他主动向领导作了汇报，并填写了违规违制表。
    当时任带钢厂党委书记的王若廉，约定厂小车司机第二天早８点把车开到前门地铁站口，接他到该厂西区（广安门）给党员上党课。由于地点交待不清，汽车未按时到达。他立即自费叫了辆出租汽车前往，但仍然迟到了１５分钟。王若廉首先向党员做了自我批评，回到厂部又立即填了违规违制表。
    如果说，上述事例还平凡无奇，那么，１９８６年６月２２日的意外大停电事故，就有力地证明首钢通过从严治厂，已培养出一支作风好、技术精的产业大军。
    那天凌晨１点５２分，由于石景山发电厂值班工人操作失误，致使首钢厂区突然停电。霎时间，十里钢城一片漆黑，９４０２台电动机全部停转，焦炉、高炉、转炉、加热炉、烧结机、轧钢机、制氧机等７４８台设备陷入瘫痪，调度因电话失灵而被迫中断，火车因不见信号而紧急刹车。更危急的是，高炉炉体会因冷却水停了而烧毁，失去压力的煤气管道会进入空气引起爆炸……还有更令人焦虑的事情：１万多名在岗工人参加抢险、排障，哪怕只有一个人操作失误，也可能引发一场灾难！
    但是，首钢职工早就熟悉自己的包、保责任，习惯于严格遵守规章制度，加上平时组织的事故预想和反事故演习，因而每个人都具有熟练的操作技术和处理意外事故的能力。例如，３号高炉工长李天印，发现照明灯闪跳几下，马上判断将要大停电，立即决定提前出铁，由于减轻了炉内压力，才使停电事故造成的损失减到最小；氧气厂控制室的值班人员，听到设备运转声音异常，就准确判断出将要停电，立即打开制氧机放空阀降压，从而保护了设备安全；动力厂管道班的工人，摸黑跑步登上十几米高的煤气管道，只用十几分钟就打开了煤气放散截门和蒸气保压设备，使上万米的煤气管道安然无恙；第二线材厂加热炉岗位上的十几名职工，在黑暗中用了不到３分钟就关闭了送风管道和煤气管道上的２８个截门，放掉了残滞在管道中的煤气，同时打开了事故备用水源，对大炉继续进行冷却处理；铸造厂铸管车间为防止盛满铁水的化铁炉被烧穿，他们不仅摸黑将铁水倒出，而且排队用铁桶、脸盆盛水泼向通红的炉壁，使化铁炉得到冷却；初轧厂的轧钢工人，凭借红钢发出的光亮，迅速用汽焊割断停在轧机里、卡在辊道上的红钢，然后用大锤再一块一块地剔除……经过如此准确的操作、果断的处理，不仅一台设备没有损失，而且一个人也没有受伤。在这突然降临的考验面前，人们看到了首钢承包制和从严治厂的强大威力！
    首钢在严格管理方面的成就，其得来是不容易的。当初，“三个１００％”刚一“亮相”，上上下下就响起一片反对声。有的厂处级干部直撇嘴：“法院对犯罪分子量刑，还讲个坦白从宽呢！一个工人违犯厂规或出点小事故，自己１００％地交待了，还要１００％地扣掉当月奖金，这有点太不近乎人情！”有的技术干部也说：“一律执行三个１００％，就是不分青红皂白！不分青红皂白，就是不加区别！而没有区别，也就没有政策！”在工人中，更有人说“考核太严了”、“扣奖太狠了”，甚至骂周冠五“缺德”。面对这种情况，周冠五和公司其他领导人心不软、嘴不软、手也不软。他们一方面据实讲理，以理引情，使大家认识１００％地执行规章制度，是保护生产力、发展生产力的大事；另一方面，又把企业要不要“三个１００％”作为议案，提请公司职工代表大会进行讨论；当职代会形成决议以后，就坚决同各级领导干部的“好人主义”作斗争：对那些不敢或不愿严格管理、严格考核、严格奖惩的干部，或调离、或免职、或处分，绝不留情。他们之所以敢于这样作，就在于他们确信：在实行承包制的条件下，从严治厂不仅必要，而且完全可能。因为过去国家、企业、个人三者利益不挂钩，职工缺乏劳动积极性，想“严”也“严”不起来。承包后，职工利益同企业经济效益紧密地联系在一起，如果考核不严，松松垮垮，事故成堆，生产任务完不成，企业效益上不去，不仅国家不能多收、企业不能多留，而且个人利益也要跟着受损失。正是承包制的这种利益机制，加上深入的思想政治工作，使遵纪守法成为首钢人的自觉行动。而且，连新并入首钢不久的１３家军工企业的干部工人，也开始按照“三个１００％”来规范自己的行为。例如，在吉林柴油机厂就发生了这样的事情：
    厂党委副书记杨学芳发现她分管的一个部门上报材料中出现疏漏，就按首钢的规矩引咎自责，扣除了自己当月奖金并通报全厂；
    厂供应处副处长因陪客人，下午上班迟到５分钟，被填了违规违制表上报；
    齿轮分厂新厂长上任当天，发现本厂工人有早退现象，就在厂里贴出“自责书”，免去自己当月奖金；
    南岭分厂青年工人张洁郁上夜班，临离家时发现自行车胎被扎破，为了不迟到，他花１５元钱乘出租汽车提前赶到了工厂……
    曾有人断言：国有企业懒懒散散、马马虎虎、凑凑合合的毛病，是“胎”里带来的，是“医生摆手——没治了”！持这种观点的同志如果抽空到首钢瞧瞧，或许会得出新的结论。
