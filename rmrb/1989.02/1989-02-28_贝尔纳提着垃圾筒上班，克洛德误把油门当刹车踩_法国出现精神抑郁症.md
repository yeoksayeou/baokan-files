Bernard is an employee of a French administrative department. One morning, he carried his household trash can downstairs, but this time he did not place the trash by the roadside as usual. Instead, he carried it onto the bus to go to work. At the office building, he greeted the doorman and then took the elevator to his office, placing the trash can on his desk. Only after realizing his absurdity did he suddenly wake up: "It's time to change jobs..."

Claude simply fled before work. One day, he drove to the workplace, and his right foot did not press the brake but suddenly stepped on the accelerator... After the car traveled five hundred kilometers, he stopped and sent a telegram to his company, resigning outright.

Due to excessive tension and heavy work pressure, people like Bernard and Claude with mental depression are increasingly common in France. Among the French labor population, one in every four has had or is suffering from this type of illness, and the number has doubled compared to twenty-five years ago. Recently, twelve French doctors issued a warning to society: mental depression and suicidal behavior are spreading like an "infectious disease," and the situation has been particularly severe in the past five years. One doctor said, "Twenty-five years ago, when I first started practicing medicine, I rarely encountered mental depression, but now it has become a common disease." The resulting suicide phenomenon is even more alarming. According to statistics, some companies have had as many as five suicides in a single week.

These twelve doctors pointed out that "ruthless competition," "the threat of unemployment," and "the relentless pursuit of profits" are the main factors causing people's mental pressure. A doctor conducted a survey and comparison of five companies and found that two companies that had just laid off some employees had half of their employees suffering from severe insomnia.

A report by the International Labour Organization states that "being unable to control one's situation" is the "common trigger" for on-the-job personnel to experience mental pressure, and workers and lower-level employees are the primary victims. They are manipulated by others and are powerless to change their situation, living in constant fear of the misfortune of unemployment, with no other way out but to work hard.

Currently, neurological diseases are attracting attention, prompting people to change some habitual practices. Some enterprise leaders have realized that they should treat their subordinates as "dialogue partners" or even "friends," making them feel comfortable in the enterprise. The French company Abel recently established an "anti-stress" center, where employees can engage in various exercises to reduce psychological pressure.

### 贝尔纳提着垃圾筒上班，克洛德误把油门当刹车踩  法国出现精神抑郁症

　　贝尔纳提着垃圾筒上班，克洛德误把油门当刹车踩
    法国出现精神抑郁症
    贝尔纳是法国一个行政部门的职员，清早，他提着自家的垃圾筒来到楼下，但这次他没有像往常那样把垃圾放在路边，而是提着它上了公共汽车去上班。在办公楼前，他同看门人打过招呼，便乘坐电梯来到办公室，把垃圾筒放到办公桌上。待他意识到自己的荒唐后，才猛然醒悟：“该换个别的工作了……”
    克洛德干脆临“班”而逃。一天，他驾车来到办公地点，右脚没有去踩刹车，而是突然踏住油门……车又行五百公里后，他才停下来，给单位发去电报索性辞职。
    由于高度紧张和工作的压力过大，像贝尔纳、克洛德这样的精神抑郁症患者在法国日益增加。法国劳动人口每四个人里便有一个患过或有这类疾病，人数之多比二十五年前增加了一倍。不久前，十二名法国医生向全社会发出警告：精神抑郁症和自杀行为犹如“传染病”在迅速扩散，近五年来尤为严重。一位医生说：“二十五年前，我刚从医时，很少遇到精神抑郁症，而今它已成了常见病。”由此而引起的自杀现象，更是触目惊心，据统计，有的企业一周内竟有五人自杀。
    这十二位医生指出：“无情的竞争”、“失业的威胁”以及“不顾一切地追求利润”是造成人们精神压力的主要因素。一位医生对五个企业做了调查对比，发现其中两个刚刚解雇了部分人员的企业有半数职工患严重的失眠症。
    国际劳工组织的一份报告认为，“无法驾驭自己的处境”是导致在职人员产生精神压力的“共同导火索”，而工人和下层职员是主要受害者。他们受人摆布，而又无能为力去改变自己的境地，终日提心吊胆，害怕失业的厄运降临在自己身上，除了拚命干活就没有别的出路。
    目前，神经系统疾病正在引起人们的重视，促使人们去改变一些习惯的做法。有的企业领导认识到，应该将自己的下属视为“对话者”甚至“朋友”，让他们在企业里感到舒心。法国的阿贝尔公司不久前还创建了“抗压力”中心，供职工进行各种锻炼，减轻心理压力。（附图片）
