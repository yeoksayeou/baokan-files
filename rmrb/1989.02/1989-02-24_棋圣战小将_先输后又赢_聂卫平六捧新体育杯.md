Young Master Wins After Initial Loss: Nie Wei Ping Wins New Sports Cup for the Sixth Time

	This reporter, Miu Lu, reports from Beijing: Today, the 37-year-old Go master Nie Wei Ping won the New Sports Cup for the sixth time, once again demonstrating his profound skills.

	At 9 AM, Nie Wei Ping and Yu Bin, an 8th dan player, sat across from each other to begin the final match determining the winner of the 10th New Sports Cup. Before this, they had already played four games. In Los Angeles, the young master Yu Bin won two consecutive games, taking the lead. When the venue moved to Singapore, Nie Wei Ping fought back fiercely, winning two consecutive games. Today's decisive battle had Yu Bin playing black and going first. During the opening stage, Nie Wei Ping took the lead with each move. Entering the middle game, Nie Wei Ping made a mistake, and the game suddenly became intense. The honorary chairman of the Chinese Go Association, Fang Yi, watching the game, was so tense that he couldn't breathe.

	Around 5 PM, some spectators thought Nie Wei Ping's situation was dire. Unexpectedly, in the endgame, Nie Wei Ping made a single move within the opponent's territory, reducing the opponent's territory by more than five points, suddenly changing the situation, and ultimately winning by 2 1/4 points.

	At the award ceremony, Nie Wei Ping reiterated, "I am happy about my new victory, but I am also uneasy about winning the championship again. I sincerely hope that young players can truly surpass me."

　　棋圣战小将　先输后又赢
    聂卫平六捧新体育杯
    本报北京２月２３日讯  记者缪鲁报道：今天，３７岁的棋圣聂卫平在此间第六次摘下新体育杯围棋赛桂冠，同时，也再一次向人们展示了自己的深厚功力。
    上午９时，聂卫平和俞斌八段对坐纹枰，开始了决定第１０届新体育杯归属的最后一战。在此之前，两人已交战四盘。在洛杉矶，小将俞斌直落两盘，先声夺人。赛场移至新加坡，聂卫平背水苦战，连扳两分。今天决战，俞斌轮黑先行。布局阶段，聂卫平着着占先。进入中盘，聂卫平不慎走出缓着，双方对弈一下子进入白热化状态。观战的中国围棋协会名誉主席方毅，见状紧张得透不过气来。
    下午５时许，有些观战者认为聂卫平大势已去。谁知，进入官子的聂卫平只在对方阵内一跳，便硬是削去了五目以上的地盘，使形势顿时改观，最终以２又１／４子的优势获胜。
    发奖仪式上，聂卫平旧话重提，“我为自己的新胜利高兴，但也为又一次得冠军不安。我衷心地希望年轻棋手能真正超过我。”
