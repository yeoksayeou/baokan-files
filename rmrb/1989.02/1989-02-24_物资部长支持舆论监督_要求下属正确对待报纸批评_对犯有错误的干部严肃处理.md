In the current campaign to build a clean government, Minister of the Ministry of Materials Liu Suiniang voluntarily accepts public opinion supervision, supports the newspaper's criticism of two of his department's subordinate units, and resolutely investigates and deals with the relevant people and incidents, earning praise from the public.

Minister Liu said in an interview with a reporter on the 23rd that the central committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council leaders have repeatedly instructed the Ministry of Materials to strengthen the construction of a clean government, to devote great efforts to studying how to strengthen management under the "dual-track" system, and how to fight against illegal and disciplinary violations. Comrade Zhao Ziyang has particularly pointed out that the materials sector is a concentrated target of corruption, and there must be a set of anti-corruption systems and methods, with clear regulations published in the newspapers to increase transparency, and there must be both internal and external supervision. Liu Suiniang believes that this supervision also includes public opinion supervision. He said that the essence of public opinion supervision is the supervision of the people, and the materials sector has great power, with over 100,000 people, how can it not accept public opinion supervision?

On January 18, the readers' letters section of this newspaper published an article titled "The Network of Reselling Lumber by the Central South Company," which exposed and criticized the Central South Company (a first-level station) under the China Timber Company for colluding with other units to resell over 10,000 cubic meters of planned imported lumber to the non-planned sector, converting it from planned prices to market prices, and then repeatedly reselling it for profit, defrauding the state and consumers. The China Timber Company has an unshirkable responsibility in this case. Facing the newspaper's correct criticism, the responsible person of the China Timber Company had mental resistance. After investigation and research, Liu Suiniang confirmed that the criticism by the People's Daily was basically true. He then had individual talks with the responsible person of the company, and convened two departmental meetings and a meeting of the timber company's cadres, ordering them to make a self-examination and severely criticize and educate them. At a meeting on February 18, Minister Liu pointed out that the People's Daily's criticism of the Central South Timber First-Level Station for engaging in network reselling is not excessive, and this account must be recognized. On the basis of thoroughly investigating the relevant people and incidents, the Ministry of Materials is preparing to make further decisions on handling the matter.

On January 10, Minister Liu presided over a meeting to publicly and seriously deal with the relevant personnel of the "friendship meeting" held by the East China First-Level Station under the China Metals and Minerals Import and Export Corporation, which squandered 1.7 million yuan of public funds in four days. The direct responsible person, Deputy Director Nian Yanzhang of the station, was given an administrative demotion; the director Zhao Guiyong, who was responsible for leadership, was given an administrative demerit; and the other two company and department cadres who did not stop the improper practices were given serious warnings within the party and administrative warnings, respectively. For other responsible persons in other units, it is suggested that the local government seriously investigate and deal with them. Gifts were all turned in, and the value of consumed items was reimbursed and handed over to the finance department.

Currently, the Ministry of Materials is using these two typical incidents and cases to conduct a campaign of clean government and anti-corruption education, as well as education on observing laws and disciplines, from top to bottom. Minister Liu thanked the newspaper for its criticism, saying that the two criticisms by the People's Daily have given the Ministry of Materials' clean government construction new momentum.

　　物资部长支持舆论监督
    要求下属正确对待报纸批评  对犯有错误的干部严肃处理
    本报讯  记者高新庆报道：在当前抓廉政建设中，物资部部长柳随年自觉接受舆论监督，支持本报对该部下属单位的两起批评，坚决查处有关人和事，受到人们的称赞。
    柳部长２３日接受记者采访时说，党中央、国务院领导同志一再指示物资部要抓好廉政建设，要下大力量研究在“双轨制”条件下，如何加强管理，如何同违法违纪行为作斗争。赵紫阳同志特别指出，物资部门是个集中受腐蚀的对象，要有一套反腐蚀的制度、办法，作出明确的规定，在报上公布，增加透明度，还要有内外监督。柳随年认为，这个监督，也包括舆论监督。他说，舆论监督的实质是人民群众的监督，物资部门权力很大，有１００多万人，不接受舆论监督怎么行？
    １月１８日本报读者来信版登载《结网倒卖木材的中南公司》一文，揭露批评中国木材总公司所属的中南公司（一级站）与其他单位联合，两次将１万多立方米计划内进口木材倒到计划外，平价转议价，又连续空倒，牟取暴利，坑害国家和消费者。此案中木材总公司有不可推卸的责任。面对报纸正确的批评，木材总公司负责人思想抵触。柳随年经过调查研究，确认人民日报批评基本属实，于是找该公司负责人个别谈话，又两次召开部务会和木材公司干部大会，责令作出检查，严厉批评教育。在２月１８日一次大会上，柳部长指出，人民日报说中南木材一级站搞结网倒卖并不过分，要认这个帐。在彻底查清有关人和事的基础上，物资部准备作出进一步处理的决定。
    １月１０日，柳部长主持会议，对人民日报１月８日批评的中国金属材料公司所属华东一级站主持召开的“联谊会”４天挥霍公款１７万元的有关人员作出公开严肃处理：对直接责任者、该站副主任倪奂章，给予行政降级处分；对负领导责任的该站主任赵桂永，给予行政记过处分；对不正之风不加制止的其他两名公司和部干部分别给予党内严重警告和行政警告处分。对其他单位责任者，建议地方政府严肃查处。礼物一律上交，实物消耗按价交款，上缴财政。
    目前，物资部正抓住这两起典型事件和案例，从上到下进行一次廉政和反腐蚀教育，以及遵纪守法教育。柳部长感谢报纸批评，他说，人民日报的两起批评，使物资部廉政建设有了新的推动力。
