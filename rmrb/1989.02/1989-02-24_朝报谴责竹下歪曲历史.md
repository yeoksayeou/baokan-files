The commentary pointed out that history does not allow for distortion and revision, and that Japan must apologize to the Korean and Asian peoples for its crimes.

The commentary said, "Japan's aggressive acts of invasion against Korea, China, and Southeast Asian countries are historical facts that no one can erase or cover up. The Japanese invaders' savage aggression caused immense suffering and disaster for the Asian peoples."

The commentary concluded by emphasizing that Japan's past crimes of aggression are indelible, no matter how many years pass. No matter what methods Japan uses, it cannot escape the responsibility for its aggression.
