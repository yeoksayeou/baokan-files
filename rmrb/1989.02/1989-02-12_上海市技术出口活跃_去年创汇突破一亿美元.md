Shanghai's technology exports are becoming increasingly popular with foreign buyers. Last year, the city's technology exports generated over $100 million in foreign exchange, a fourfold increase from the previous year.

According to relevant sources, Shanghai's technology exports have expanded from five countries to 14 countries and regions. Nearly 100 types of technologies have been exported to overseas markets such as Japan, Switzerland, Australia, Yugoslavia, and Hong Kong. These technologies include medical production technology, freshwater aquaculture technology, and various production and manufacturing technologies in textiles, monosodium glutamate, papermaking, pen manufacturing, and glassware. Additionally, high-tech products like Chinese language computer software, infrared filters, pocket nuclear radiation meters, and crystal devices have been introduced.

The practicality of the technologies and the improvement in product quality have been crucial factors in the rapid development of Shanghai's technology exports. Research departments in industries such as machinery, light industry, food, chemical, and electronics have developed production technologies and product manufacturing technologies according to foreign customers' requirements, which have been widely welcomed by foreign enterprises. These five industries alone generated $16 million in technology exports annually. Due to the good returns from these applicable technologies, last year also saw a boost in the export of complete sets of equipment, generating $23 million in foreign exchange.

To facilitate foreign trade, Shanghai has adopted diverse and flexible methods for technology exports. Some research institutes have established technology trade points and technology product consignment processing points in the United States, Singapore, and other locations. Joint ventures with foreign companies have also been established to develop high technologies. The Municipal Science and Technology Commission and foreign trade departments have collaborated to organize technology product exhibitions overseas, promoting technology to the international market. Last year, a single technology trade exhibition held in Hong Kong alone generated $33 million in deals.

　　上海市技术出口活跃
    去年创汇突破一亿美元
    新华社上海２月１１日电（记者张学全）上海的技术商品越来越受到外商青睐：去年技术创汇突破一亿美元，比上年增长４倍。
    据有关人士介绍，上海的技术商品已从外销５个国家增至１４个国家和地区，已有近百种技术输入日本、瑞士、澳大利亚、南斯拉夫、香港等海外市场。这些技术包括医药生产技术、淡水养鱼技术；纺织、味精、造纸、制笔、玻璃器皿等多方面的生产技术和制造技术；还推出了中文计算机软件、红外滤光片、袖珍核辐射仪、晶体器件等一批高技术产品。
    技术实用性强，技术产品质量提高，是促成上海技术出口迅猛发展的重要因素。市机械、轻工、食品、化工、电子行业等科研部门，按外商要求开发的生产技术、产品制造技术，普遍博得国外企业欢迎。这５个行业年技术创汇达１６００万美元。由于这些适用技术效益好，去年同时带动成套设备出口，创汇达２３００万美元。
    为便利外商，上海技术出口方式多而灵活。一些研究所在美国、新加坡等地设立了技术贸易点、技术产品委托加工点；并组建了开发高技术的中外合资公司；市科委和外贸部门合作，还组织技术商品到海外展览，推动了技术走向国际。去年，仅在香港办的一次技术贸易展览会，就成交３３００万美元。
