Li Peng met with Shevardnadze, saying that the upcoming high-level Sino-Soviet meeting is a significant event. Normalization of relations between the two countries is beneficial to both peoples and to world peace.

New China News Agency, Beijing, February 3 (reporters Chai Shikuang, Zhu Yunlong) Premier Li Peng said today in the afternoon at Zhongnanhai that the upcoming high-level Sino-Soviet meeting is a significant event. The normalization of Sino-Soviet relations is beneficial to both countries' peoples and also to world peace and stability.

Li Peng pointed out that China and the Soviet Union are neighboring countries and are both carrying out reforms. They can learn from each other's experiences and cooperate economically.

During the meeting, which lasted 100 minutes, the host and guest exchanged in-depth views on Sino-Soviet relations and the Cambodian issue.

Shevardnadze said to Li Peng, "The two countries should establish and develop relations on the basis of the new thinking of General Secretary Gorbachev and the new international political order proposed by Chairman Deng Xiaoping. The principle of peaceful coexistence should permeate these relations."

Shevardnadze believes that the reforms being carried out in China are revolutionary and have profound significance, influencing the whole world.

When talking about the Cambodian issue, Li Peng said that Shevardnadze's visit to China this time should play a role in promoting the political settlement of the Cambodian issue, thereby removing the main obstacle to the normalization of Sino-Soviet relations.

Li Peng emphasized that Vietnam's withdrawal from Cambodia must be genuine, and there should be international supervision. China does not approve of completely separating the international and domestic aspects of the Cambodian issue, otherwise, it will leave aftereffects. He said, "We advocate that the Cambodian issue should be resolved by the Cambodian people themselves. We support the establishment of a provisional joint government led by Prince Sihanouk."

Shevardnadze conveyed greetings from CPSU General Secretary Gorbachev and Premier Ryzhkov to Li Peng. Li Peng also asked Shevardnadze to convey his greetings to Gorbachev and Ryzhkov.

Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen was present during the meeting.

　　李鹏会见谢瓦尔德纳泽时说
　  中苏高级会晤是重要事件
    两国关系正常化有利于双方人民和世界和平
    新华社北京２月３日电  （记者柴世宽、朱云龙）国务院总理李鹏今天下午在中南海会见苏联外交部长爱·阿·谢瓦尔德纳泽时说，将要举行的中苏高级会晤是重要事件，中苏关系正常化有利于两国人民，也有利于世界的和平与稳定。
    李鹏指出，中苏是邻国，又都在进行改革，相互可以借鉴经验，经济上可以彼此合作。
    在长达１００分钟的会见中，宾主就中苏关系和柬埔寨问题深入地交换了意见。
    谢瓦尔德纳泽对李鹏说，苏中两国应在戈尔巴乔夫总书记的新思维的基础上和在邓小平主席提出的国际政治新秩序的基础上建立和发展关系，贯穿这种关系的应是和平共处原则。
    谢瓦尔德纳泽认为，中国正在进行的改革具有革命性，有深刻的意义，对全世界有影响。
    李鹏在谈到柬埔寨问题时说，谢瓦尔德纳泽这次来华访问应对政治解决柬埔寨问题起到推动作用，以消除中苏两国关系正常化中的主要障碍。
    李鹏强调，越南从柬埔寨撤军必须是真撤军，撤军应有国际监督。中国不赞成把柬埔寨问题的国际部分和国内部分完全分开，否则将会留下后遗症。他说，“我们主张柬埔寨问题应由柬埔寨人民自己解决，我们支持建立以西哈努克亲王为首的四方临时联合政府。”
    谢瓦尔德纳泽向李鹏转达了苏共中央总书记戈尔巴乔夫和部长会议主席雷日科夫的问候。李鹏也请谢瓦尔德纳泽向戈尔巴乔夫和雷日科夫转达他的问候。
    中国外交部长钱其琛会见时在座。
