Representatives of the three factions of the Khmer People's National Liberation Front (KPNLF) announced tonight in Bangkok that they will attend the second informal Jakarta meeting on the Cambodian issue to be held next month in Indonesia.

Thai Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan met tonight with Prince Norodom Sihanouk's personal representative to Cambodia and Asia, Prince Norodom Sirivudh, and the leaders of the three factions of the KPNLF: KPNLF President Son Sann, Deputy Chairman of the Democratic Kampuchea in charge of foreign affairs Khieu Samphan, and Prince Norodom Sirivudh. After the meeting, the representatives of the three factions spoke to the press. Son Sann conveyed Chatichai's message, saying that Hun Sen's attitude has become more flexible, and peace in Cambodia is within sight. He said, "We have decided to attend the meeting to see if Hun Sen will keep his word to Chatichai." Khieu Samphan, in response to a reporter's question, said that Vietnam should withdraw its troops under international supervision as soon as possible and establish a national reconciliation government led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk. He hopes that the Cambodian issue will be resolved soon.

Chatichai told reporters after the meeting, "The most important outcome of today's meeting is that the three factions of the KPNLF will attend the Jakarta meeting." He said that the Thai people hope that Cambodia will restore peace as soon as possible.
