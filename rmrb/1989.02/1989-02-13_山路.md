	Mountain Path
	Guo Yuefang

	Just like this, you spiral, sometimes entering the clouds, sometimes sinking into the valley; just like this, you crawl, sometimes clinging to the precipice, sometimes hugging the cliff. The winds and rains of the years have eroded your youthful skin, leaving it mottled and worn. The exposed ancient vines tell the world of your tumultuous journey...

	Originally, each of your steps could have been used as the pillars of a grand building, firmly supporting countless colorful spaces; originally, each of your pebbles could have been laid on that shining road, letting the roaring wheels play a majestic symphony...

	But you chose the mountains, chose the barren and desolate land. There have been landslides and earthquakes, there have been lightning strikes, there have been scorching heatwaves, and there have been cold snaps. What of it? You raise your head, you stretch out your arms, you believe that ahead lies a vibrant world, and above is a new horizon...

	So, the mountain path spirals and crawls, letting explorers step from your shoulders towards the mountain peak, letting those burdened step from your side towards victory, letting travelers find laughter from your side, and letting treasure hunters pluck the secrets of the great mountains...

	The world around the mountain path is colorful and wondrous. Blooming azaleas light up the sky with the flames of life, towering pines and cypresses cover the earth with the green of youth. A thousand-foot waterfall sprays a rainbow in the setting sun, and birds sing songs in the depths of the forest...

	The mountain path bends its back, crawls its body, silently and without complaint bearing a heavy hope, a long story, and countless winding philosophies...

　　山路
    郭曰方
    就这样盘旋着，或插入云端，或沉入谷底；就这样匍匐着，或攀着悬崖，或贴着峭壁；岁月的风雨，已将你青春的肌肤剥蚀得斑驳陆离，那裸露的古藤向世人讲述着你坎坷的经历……
    本来，你的每一块阶石都可以去充当大厦的梁柱，用力的刚毅支撑起无数多彩的空间；本来，你的每一粒石子，都可以铺在那闪光的大道，让轰响的车轮奏出雄壮的交响曲……
    但是，你却义无反顾地选择了大山，选择了贫瘠而荒芜的土地。曾经有山崩地裂，曾经有闪电霹雳，曾经有热浪侵扰，曾经有寒流袭击，这算得什么呢？你昂起头颅，你伸出手臂，你相信，前方有一个生机勃勃的世界，高处有一片崭新的天地……
    于是，山路盘旋着，匍匐着，让探索者从肩头一步步走向山巅，让负重者从身边一步步踏向胜利，让游人从身边去寻找笑声，让寻宝者去摘取大山的秘密……
    山路周围的世界五彩纷呈，美妙神奇，盛开的杜鹃花用生命的火焰映红了天空，挺拔的松柏用青春的绿荫遮盖着大地，千丈飞瀑在夕阳下喷出七色彩虹，百鸟在密林深处弹奏歌曲……
    山路弓着脊背，匍匐着躯体，默默地、永无怨艾地驮起一个沉甸甸的希望，一串长长的故事，一条条曲折的哲理……
