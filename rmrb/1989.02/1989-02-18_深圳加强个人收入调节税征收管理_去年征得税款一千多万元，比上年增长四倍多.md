Shenzhen Strengthens the Management of Personal Income Adjustment Tax Collection

Last year, Shenzhen collected over 10 million yuan in personal income adjustment tax, an increase of more than four times compared to the previous year.

Shenzhen has taken concrete steps to strengthen the management of personal income adjustment tax collection. In 1988, the city collected personal income adjustment tax from 170,000 individuals, totaling 11.79 million yuan, an increase of 4.3 times compared to the previous year.

Personal income adjustment tax is a new tax category introduced in 1987. Due to the dispersed nature of the tax base and the lack of personal tax-paying habits among Chinese citizens, the collection of this tax has been challenging. The Shenzhen government has repeatedly emphasized the need for various departments and units to actively cooperate with tax authorities to improve the management of personal income adjustment tax collection. It has also required leaders at all levels to lead by example in complying with tax laws, voluntarily declaring and paying taxes, and not evading or delaying payments.

At the same time, tax authorities at all levels in Shenzhen have used various forms of publicity to widely promote the tax. They have printed and distributed more than 100,000 copies of the "Personal Income Adjustment Tax Promotion Outline." They have also taken practical steps to improve the management system and methods. The city has established personal income adjustment tax management offices or specialized teams in eight sub-bureaus and set up collection points in areas with dispersed tax bases. To strengthen the management of tax sources, the Shenzhen tax authorities have focused on implementing self-declaration and withholding systems. They have distributed "Personal Income Adjustment Tax Monthly Declaration Forms" to taxpayers on time, allowing them to declare their taxes voluntarily. Last year, more than 100,000 individuals voluntarily declared and paid their taxes, accounting for 62% of the total number of taxpayers; they paid 6.12 million yuan in taxes, accounting for 51% of the total tax revenue. From January to May last year, the proportion of leaders in enterprises and institutions who evaded or delayed tax payments was as high as 44%, mainly due to the failure of the financial departments to withhold taxes. The tax authorities have implemented measures to ensure that every unit and individual complies with the tax laws. By August, all leaders who were required to pay taxes had their taxes withheld by the financial departments, thereby promoting the collection of personal income adjustment tax through withholding and increasing the amount collected. For the income of itinerant performers, the tax is collected by determining a withholding rate per performance, plugging the loopholes.

### 深圳加强个人收入调节税征收管理  去年征得税款一千多万元，比上年增长四倍多

　　深圳加强个人收入调节税征收管理    
    去年征得税款一千多万元，比上年增长四倍多
    本报讯  深圳市切实加强个人收入调节税的征收管理，１９８８年征收个人收入调节税１７万人次，累计税款１１７９万元，比上年增长４．３倍。
    个人收入调节税是１９８７年开征的新税种，由于税源分散，加之我国公民缺乏个人纳税习惯，征收难度大。深圳市政府多次强调各部门、各单位要积极配合税务机关搞好个人收入调节税的征管，并要求各级领导干部带头执行税法，主动申报纳税，不许偷漏、拖欠。
    与此同时，深圳市各级税务机关利用多种形式广泛宣传，并印发了十多万份《个人收入调节税宣传提纲》。他们从实际出发，健全征管制度，改进征管办法。全市在８个分局设立了个人收入调节税征管科所或专管组，在税源分散的地区设代征点。为了抓好税源控制的基础管理，深圳税务机关重点抓了纳税人自行申报和代扣制度的落实。他们按时把《个人收入调节税月份申报表》发给纳税人，让纳税人自行申报。去年全市自觉申报纳税的达１０万余人次，占总纳税人次的６２％；自行交款６１２万元，占总纳税额的５１％。去年１至５月，全市企事业单位领导干部漏欠税款的比例高达４４％，主要原因是支付款的财务部门未扣缴税款。税务机关一个单位、一个人地落实，到８月份，所有应纳税的领导干部已全部由财务部门代扣纳税，从而促进了全市个人收入调节税的代扣征收，入库额明显增加，全市自征额由原来的五六十万元增加到一百多万元。对流动歌舞演员的演出收入，也实行核定代征率按场次征收个人收入调节税，堵塞了漏洞。
