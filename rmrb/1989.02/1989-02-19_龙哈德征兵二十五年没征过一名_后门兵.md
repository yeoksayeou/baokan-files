Long Hade, deputy commander of the Mong Self Military Sub-district in Yunnan Province, has been in charge of recruitment for 25 years. He has recruited over 11,000 new soldiers, none of whom were "backdoor soldiers," and all met the qualifications. He has been commended by the Yunnan Provincial Government and the Yunnan Provincial Military Region.

During the 1987 recruitment, a young man who had been detained for fighting was allowed to pass the physical examination and political review through "connections." Long Hade discovered this and immediately crossed out the young man's name. Someone brought cigarettes and alcohol to plead for the young man, but Long Hade was furious: "The military is not a rehabilitation center; we cannot hand over guns to someone with a criminal record."

Long Hade's four children are all farming in the Hani village in Honghe County. The children yearned to wear the "green of national defense." Local leaders and his colleagues wanted to use "special recruitment" to fulfill his children's wish to join the army, but he stopped it every time. He said, "I know clearly that my four children do not meet the recruitment standards."

　　龙哈德征兵二十五年没征过一名“后门兵”
    据新华社昆明２月１８日电  （通讯员张华兴、记者段建勋）云南省蒙自军分区副司令员龙哈德负责征兵工作２５年，共征集新兵１．１万余名，无一名“后门兵”，质量个个合格，受到云南省人民政府和云南省军区的表彰。
    １９８７年征兵时，一个因打架斗殴曾被拘留过的青年，通过“关系”过了体检、政审关。龙哈德发现后毫不迟疑地划掉了这名青年的名字。有人提着烟酒来说情，龙哈德气得发了火：“部队不是收容所，枪杆子不能交给有劣迹的人。”
    龙哈德的４个孩子都在老家红河县哈尼山寨务农。孩子们十分羡慕“国防绿”。当地领导和他的同事想通过“特招”，让他的孩子实现当兵愿望，但几次都被他阻止了。他说：“我自己清楚，４个孩子都达不到应征条件。”
