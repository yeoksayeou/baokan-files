Zhao Ziyang Meets with Romanian Guests to Discuss Domestic Situation
Rectification and Readjustment Achieve Results, Future Tasks More Arduous

BEIJING, Feb. 22 (Xinhua) -- General Secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee Zhao Ziyang said today that the Party's work should follow the policy of "two hands," that is, one hand to promote construction, reform, and opening up, and develop a commodity economy; the other hand to handle work in the ideological and political fields, including the political and legal front and the public security system.

This was what Zhao Ziyang said this afternoon when he met with Duder Postelnicu, a member of the Executive Committee of the Romanian Communist Party Central Committee and the Minister of Internal Affairs, who was invited to visit China.

Zhao Ziyang said that since last October, three months have passed, and generally speaking, our rectification and readjustment work has achieved results. Of course, to complete the entire task, it will still take two or three years. The overall rectification work has now begun, and the tasks ahead are more arduous. From the current situation, the overall trend is changing for the better. Although we have encountered many difficulties, we are fully capable of achieving the goals set by the Third Plenary Session of the 13th CPC Central Committee.

Zhao Ziyang said that it now appears that the policy of developing a commodity economy in socialist countries can promote the development of productive forces and economic prosperity, but it will also bring many problems. He said that these problems include both economic issues and issues in the ideological and political fields. We must promote economic development while preventing and stopping the spread of capitalist vices in China. Only in this way can we truly demonstrate the superiority of socialism. Therefore, our policy should not be just one aspect, but both aspects.

He said that we cannot be shaken by these problems and give up on reform and opening up, as the Chinese saying goes, "to stop eating because of choking." However, we must not be complacent about the negative phenomena that have already occurred. We must leverage the advantages of socialism to strongly resist and minimize these negative elements and vices. He believed that the main reasons for these problems are twofold: first, insufficient estimation and lack of spiritual preparation beforehand; second, lack of experience, so all aspects are not adapted. He added that this is a new problem that requires new methods. During the meeting, both sides expressed their desire to further develop relations between the two parties and the two countries.

State Councilor and Minister of Public Security Wang Fang attended the meeting.

　　赵紫阳会见罗马尼亚客人时谈国内形势
    治理整顿取得成效  今后任务更加艰巨
    本报北京二月二十二日讯  记者孙毅报道：中共中央总书记赵紫阳今天说：全党工作要实行两手抓的方针，就是一手抓建设、改革开放，发展商品经济；另一手抓思想政治领域的工作，包括政法战线和公安系统的工作。
    这是赵紫阳今天下午在中南海会见应邀来访的罗马尼亚共产党中央政治执行委员会候补委员、政府内务部长杜多尔·波斯特尔尼库时讲这番话的。
    赵紫阳说，从去年十月份到现在，三个月过去了，总的来说，我们的治理整顿工作取得了成效。当然，要完成整个任务，还需要两、三年的时间，整个的治理工作现在已经开始，今后的任务更艰巨。从现在看，总的形势是在向好的方面变化。尽管我们出现不少困难，但是我们完全可以实现三中全会确定的目标。
    赵紫阳说，现在看来，社会主义国家实行发展商品经济的方针，既可以推动生产力的发展，促进经济的繁荣，也会带来很多问题。他说，这些问题，既有经济方面的问题，也有思想政治领域方面的问题。我们既要促进经济的发展，又要防止和制止资本主义社会那些弊病在中国泛滥。只有这样才能真正显示出社会主义优越性。所以，我们的方针不能只要一条，而是两条都要。
    他说，我们不能看到这些问题就对改革开放发生动摇，像中国的一句老话“因噎废食”。但是对于已经发生的消极现象也不能掉以轻心。必须发挥社会主义的优势，对消极的东西、弊病给予强有力的抵制，使这些东西减少到最低限度。他认为，现在发生这些问题主要是两个原因，一是估计不足，事前没有精神准备；二是缺乏经验，所以各方面都不适应。他接着说，这是个新问题，需要有新的办法。会见时，宾主双方表示要进一步发展中罗两党、两国的关系。
    国务委员、公安部长王芳参加了会见。
