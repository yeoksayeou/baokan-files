Video tapes—once of dubious reputation, some critics only regarded them as "semi-art" or "sub-art." In our country, they were not worthy of advertising in newspapers and magazines.

From the perspective of communication studies, the mass entertainment in our country can be divided into three periods: the "pre-radio and television period," when people's entertainment was mainly concentrated in entertainment venues such as cinemas, theaters, storytellers' stages, and amusement parks; the "radio and television period," when people dispersed into their homes to listen to the radio and watch television; and the "post-radio and television period," when video tapes emerged, and people showed great interest in them because they offered the greatest freedom of choice and convenience, unlike radio and television where you had to watch or listen to whatever was being broadcast. Currently, in countries like England, America, and Japan, more than 50% of households own a video recorder. In Shanghai, about 100,000 households own a video recorder. These two figures indicate that some Western countries have entered the "post-radio and television period," while Shanghai is transitioning from the "radio and television period" to the "post-radio and television period."

According to relevant materials, China currently has 2 million video recorders; by 1990, annual production of video recorders can reach 1 million units. Now, there are more than 30,000 video playback points nationwide, with Shanghai alone having 412. The number of viewers per year is 20 million. Theaters are in crisis, films are declining, while "semi-art" or "sub-art" is thriving.

Foreign video equipment was introduced to the mainland in the 1970s. Shanghai's video industry began in the second half of 1981. It was not until after 1985 that we had domestic productions; previously, they were mostly dominated by imported Hong Kong and Taiwan films. Therefore, the impression was: video tapes = overseas films = Hong Kong and Taiwan films. Some people went to watch video tapes not to appreciate art but to see "fists" (martial arts) and "pillows" (bedroom scenes), seeking sensory stimulation. It must be admitted that video tapes, due to fewer restrictions and being more open than television broadcasts and cinema films, have a certain appeal. Moreover, watching television is free, watching movies costs less, while video tapes cost more. Without high watchability and more entertainment value, who would want to spend more money?

So, to enhance watchability and entertainment value, must it be "fists" and "pillows"? Not necessarily. There are many excellent, high-quality, and very appealing video tapes, but these mainly come from overseas. However, importing top-tier overseas video tapes is expensive and requires foreign exchange. For example, overseas films that win the Oscar are all made into video tapes, but we do not have the financial means to import them in large quantities. The author once heard a master's student studying communication in the United States say that he spent $10 to buy a magnetic key there, conveniently borrowing video tapes from an unmanned video rental store, and could borrow any kind of video tape.

As for domestic video tapes, people generally hold a critical attitude. Although the production and distribution of domestic video tapes are numerous, nationwide, domestic productions account for two-thirds, and imports account for one-third. In actual screenings, the number of screenings of foreign films far exceeds that of domestic films. Shanghai's statistics show that the number of domestic releases is more, compared to foreign films at a ratio of 13:1, but the number of releases is reversed: 1:10, and actual screenings are mostly foreign: 8:1. But it cannot be generalized. Films like "Shanghai Bund Kidnapping Case" and "Let History Tell the Future" have a large audience. This shows that the quality of domestic films can be improved and can occupy the video market.

There are many problems in the production and screening of video tapes, and the key to solving them is to enhance entertainment value and improve artistic quality. Some people suggest that we should not only focus on the middle (referring to youth) but also consider both ends (referring to the elderly and young people), which is reasonable. As video recorders enter thousands of households, the audience is no longer "young" only. Video tapes need to expand their themes to adapt to the diverse viewing needs and aesthetic tastes. Additionally, the production and screening of video tapes also involve a scientific management issue that cannot be taken lightly.

　　录像片：一种迅速扩展的文化形式
    姚荣铨
    录像片——过去名声欠佳，评论界的一些人士只把它看作“准艺术”或“亚艺术”。在我国，它是不配在报刊上登广告的。
    从传播学的角度看，我国的大众娱乐可分三个时期：“前广播电视时期”，人们娱乐主要集中于娱乐场所，诸如影院、戏馆、书场、游乐世界；“广播电视时期”，人们分散于家庭内听广播看电视；“后广播电视时期”，录像片兴起，人们对录像片极有兴趣，因其最可供人自由选择，随心所欲，不像广播电视播映什么你就只能看什么听什么。目前，在英、美、日等西方国家里，５０％以上的家庭拥有录像机。上海约有１０万左右家庭拥有录像机。这两个数字表明，西方的一些国家已进入“后广播电视时期”，上海正由“广播电视时期”逐渐向“后广播电视时期”过渡。
    根据有关材料，中国目前有２００万部录像机；到１９９０年，年产录像机可达１００万部。现在，全国录像放映点已超过３万，单上海一地就有４１２家，观众人次每年２０００万。剧场危机重重，电影滑坡，而“准艺术”或“亚艺术”正方兴未艾。
    国外录像设备７０年代传入大陆。上海的录像事业则是从１９８１年下半年开始的。直到１９８５年以后，我们才有了国产片，以前多被从海外转入的港台片所垄断。因此给人一种印象：录像片＝海外片＝港台片。有些人去看录像片不是去欣赏艺术，而是看“拳头”（武打）和“枕头”（床上戏），寻找官能刺激。应该承认，录像片由于所受的限制比较少，而且比电视台播出的电视剧和电影院公映的电影故事片更为开放一些；而且，看电视不花钱，看电影少花钱，录像则要多花钱，没有较高的可看性、较多的娱乐性，谁愿意白花钱、多花钱呢！
    那么，强化可看性、娱乐性，非得“拳头”和“枕头”吗？那也未必。优秀的、高档次而又很吸引人的录像片并不少，但这主要来自海外。然而引进海外一流的录像片价格很高，还要外汇。比如国外把荣获奥斯卡金像奖的影片都翻成录像片，我们就无财力去大量引进。笔者曾听一位到美国攻传播学的硕士说，他在那里花１０美元买一把磁性钥匙，十分方便地到无人录像片出租店借录像片，什么样的录像都能借到。
    至于国产录像片，现在人们普遍持批评态度。虽然国产录像片制作发行很多，就全国范围来看，国产占三分之二，引进占三分之一，实际放映时，外片场次远远超过国产片。上海的统计说明，发行品种国产居多，和外片比较为１３∶１，但发行量却倒过来：１∶１０，实际放映却是海外居多：８∶１。但也不能一概而论。像《上海滩绑票奇案》、《让历史告诉未来》就很有观众。这表明，国产片质量能够提高、也能够占领录像市场。
    录像片的录制、放映中问题很多，解决的关键问题是要强化娱乐性，提高艺术性。有人提出不能只顾中间（指青年），还须兼顾两头（指老年和少年），是有道理的。随着录像机进入千家万户，观众已不再“青”一色，录像片要开拓题材以适应多层次的观赏需求和审美情趣。另外，录像片的生产和放映还有一个科学管理问题，不可等闲视之。
