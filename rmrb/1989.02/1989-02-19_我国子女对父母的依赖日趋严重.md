In China, children's dependence on their parents is becoming increasingly severe.

Education and learning depend on parents. Currently, many primary schools have implemented the "parental homework review" system. More than three-quarters of the students complete their homework with the help of their parents. Parents are working tirelessly to be the "second teacher."

Promotion and employment depend on parents. During the entrance exams for primary school, junior high, senior high, and university, parents are more anxious than their children. If a child fails to get into a school, during the job-hunting process, finding connections, seeking help, choosing a career, and picking a job, all these are naturally handled by the parents.

Marriage and family life depend on parents. Currently, urban young people getting married generally spend between 3,000 to 7,800 yuan, with some spending over 10,000 yuan. Taking a certain city's average marriage age for men and women, which is 23 and 25 respectively, by the time they get married, they have worked for at most five or six years, and their savings generally do not exceed 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. The deficit is naturally covered by the parents.

Improving living conditions depends on parents. Even after children get married, many do not pay for meals at home, and when it comes to buying large household items, they turn to their parents for "sponsorship." When children have their own children, the responsibility of raising the grandchildren naturally falls on the elderly.

### 我国子女对父母的依赖日趋严重

　　我国子女对父母的依赖日趋严重
    在我国，子女对父母的依赖日趋严重。
    读书学习依赖父母。现在许多小学都普遍实行“家长检查作业”制度。有四分之三以上的学生，是在父母的帮助下完成作业。家长为当“第二教师”而殚精竭虑。
    升学就业依赖父母。小学、初中、高中、大学各级升学考试中父母比子女还着急，一旦考不上，在就业过程中，找门路、托关系、选职业、挑工种，自然都由家长包办。
    结婚成家依赖父母。眼下城市青年人结婚，一般花费在三千元到七八千元，多的过万。以某市男、女青年平均婚龄二十三与二十五岁看，双方至结婚时工作年份至多五六年，积蓄一般不会超过三四千元，差额部分自然由父母弥补。
    改善生活依赖父母。即使子女结了婚，相当多的回家吃饭不付钱，逢上添置大家具，更向父母要“赞助”。子女有了自己的子女，那么扶养儿孙辈的责任，就自然地落到了老人身上。　（一九八八年十二月二十八日《汕头特区报》）
