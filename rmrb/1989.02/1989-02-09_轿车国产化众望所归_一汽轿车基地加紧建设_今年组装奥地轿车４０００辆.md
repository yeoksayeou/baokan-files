First Automobile Works accelerates construction of car base
4,000 Audi cars to be assembled this year

    The First Automobile Works in Changchun, which has been producing medium-duty trucks for 30 years, has shifted its strategic focus to car production. The 70,000 employees of the First Automobile Works, with the spirit of "replacing imports and developing the domestic car industry," have embarked on what they call their third major initiative.

    Recently, the factory director, Gang Zhaojie, who was awarded the title of National Excellent Entrepreneur, said: China's car industry started late, and the domestic market's demand for cars is in a state of urgency. The 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic, the Asian Games, and the renewal of imported cars all require cars. Therefore, the First Automobile Works' decision to develop cars is: practical, quick start. One plan, phased implementation. First, build a pilot plant with an annual production capacity of 30,000 cars, start quickly, produce cars quickly, to alleviate the urgent market demand. On this basis, phase in construction to reach an economic scale of 150,000 cars and 300,000 cars.

    Currently, the main buildings of the car pilot plant, as well as the supporting engine plant, foundry, and mold center, have been erected in the new plant area. The factory buildings are heated and sealed, and construction continues as usual. The paint line and welding line buildings have completed comprehensive hoisting. The stamping equipment will be installed this year. The total construction area of the first phase of the project is 400,000 square meters, and by the end of last month, 250,000 square meters have been completed.

    It is understood that the state will give the First Automobile Works preferential policies to accelerate the construction of the country's first car base. With the approval of the state, the First Automobile Works has begun to assemble Audi cars using imported components. The more than 400 Audi cars assembled last year have been gradually put into the market. This year, 4,000 more Audi cars will be assembled.

    The central leadership and the domestic people are most concerned about the progress of domestic production. In response to the reporter's question, Li Zhiguo, the general commander of the light car project, said that it is estimated that by 1991, when the 30,000-car pilot plant is completed, the first car will roll off the assembly line, and the domestic production rate can reach 80%.

　　轿车国产化众望所归
　　一汽轿车基地加紧建设
　　今年组装奥地轿车４０００辆
    本报讯  记者林钢报道：卅年来一贯生产中型载重卡车的长春第一汽车制造厂，已将工厂发展的战略重点，移向轿车生产。７万一汽职工怀着“替代进口，发展民族轿车工业”的豪情壮志，开始了他们称之为第三次创业的新的征途。
    最近荣获全国优秀企业家称号的厂长耿昭杰说：中国轿车工业起步已晚，国内市场对轿车的需求呈现饥饿状态。国庆４０周年、亚运会、进口轿车更新，都需要轿车。因此一汽发展轿车的决策思想是：务实，快上。方案一次规划，工程分期实施。先建成年产３万辆的先导厂，快起步，快出车，以缓解市场急需。在此基础上，再分期建设，达到１５万辆、３０万辆的经济规模。
    目前，轿车先导厂的主体厂房以及与之配套的发动机厂、铸造厂和模具中心等几座新的宏大的建筑物，已在新厂区矗立起来。厂房实行暖封闭，施工继续照常进行。油漆线、焊装线厂房已完成综合吊装。冲压设备今年要安装完毕。第一期工程总建筑面积４０万平方米，到上月底止已完成２５万平方米。
    据悉，国家将给一汽以倾斜政策，加速发展我国第一个轿车基地的建设。经国家批准，一汽已开始用进口散件方式组装奥地轿车。去年组装的４００多辆奥地轿车已陆续投放市场。今年将继续组装奥地车４０００辆。
    中央领导和国内人民最关心的是国产化进度。对此，轻轿工程总指挥李治国在回答记者提问时说，预计，到１９９１年３万辆先导厂建成，第一辆轿车从总配线上驶下来时，国产化率已可达到８０％。
