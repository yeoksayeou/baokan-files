The ancient city of Dechang is located in the middle section of the Chengkun Railway, which traverses countless mountains and valleys, on the west bank of the roaring Anning River. Within Dechang City stands a bell and drum tower, hexagonal and three stories high, standing 24 meters tall, all constructed from blue bricks.

Inside the smooth arch of the bell and drum tower, there are clusters of swallows' nests hanging in groups, with approximately a thousand swallows flying back and forth, chirping and singing. Strangely, unlike swallows in other places that migrate with the seasons, the swallows here do not leave even in winter; they stay here year-round, breeding, singing, and living.

The swallows' nests are not clearly visible in terms of the materials used to build them. One can only see that they are layered and connected, with a meticulous layout; horizontally and vertically interwoven, odd and even numbers alternating, as if designed and carefully embedded by a single skilled craftsman. Such a large expanse of nests, while individually not heavy, cumulatively weigh quite a bit. They stretch over 4 meters in length and 3 meters in width, and are adhered to the ceiling without much support, yet they have withstood the test of time, truly a marvel.

Legend has it that when the bell and drum tower was built in 1912, a flock of swallows flew in from the distant East China Sea's Putuo Mountain. Later, they discovered that this place was warm in winter and cool in summer, with beautiful scenery, abundant resources, and kind-hearted, simple people. Thus, they decided to stay and breed here for generations.

In 1951, a 5.5 magnitude earthquake struck this area. It is said that before the earthquake, the swallows flew out in alarm, darting around the eaves of countless homes, their cries piercing and seemingly warning the people in their unique language. After that, they flew away. This allowed the people of Dechang to be somewhat prepared when the earthquake hit. Since then, the bond between the people of Dechang and the swallows has grown even deeper.

　　燕子不愿离去的地方
    田闻
    古城德昌，位于穿越了千山万壑的成昆铁路中段、滔滔的安宁河西岸。德昌城中有座钟鼓楼，六角三层，高２４米，皆为青砖砌成。
    钟鼓楼光滑的拱壁内顶上，有一簇簇连成片的“燕群悬巢”，约有上千只燕子，往来翻飞，辗转啁啾。奇怪的是，别的地方的燕子都是冬去春来，而这里的燕子却冬天也不离去；一年四季在这里繁衍、鸣唱、生息。
    燕巢看不清究竟是用什么材料筑成的，只见它们层层连贯，布局谨严；横直互制，奇偶相倚，似乎是由一个匠心独运的设计师仔细镶嵌上去的。这么一大摊燕巢，单个重量不大，但重叠起来则很可观，长达４米多，宽达３米多，且凌空粘砌，没什么依托，却能久经岁月的洗礼，不能不说是个奇迹。
    传说这钟鼓楼１９１２年修建时，群燕从遥远的东海普陀山结队而来。后来发现这地方冬暖夏凉，山川秀丽，物产富饶，民情淳朴善良，就留了下来，世代繁衍。
    １９５１年，这里发生过一次５．５级地震。据说，地震前夕，群燕惊飞，在千家万户门檐下乱窜，其声凄厉，似在用独特的语言向人们报警，而后飞走。使地震袭来时，德昌人民有所准备。这以后，更加深了德昌人民与燕子的感情。
