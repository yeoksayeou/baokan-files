Some township enterprises, after being closed down, have suffered significant asset losses due to inadequate follow-up work and lack of necessary management measures. In Hubei Province, Songzi County, Xizhai Township's Ma Steel Factory and Electric Heating Factory were closed in April 1984 and December 1987, respectively. At the time of closure, the total assets of the two enterprises amounted to 805,400 yuan. Today, almost all the original assets have been lost, leaving only a few dilapidated factory buildings and some severely damaged equipment. The total value of lost and damaged assets is 537,900 yuan, which accounts for 66.79% of the assets at the time of closure.

The lost assets include two main categories: first, due to long-term lack of management, natural wear and tear caused by wind and rain resulted in 522,500 yuan in losses; second, due to the lack of necessary management measures, some of the enterprise's property was stolen, some was transferred without compensation by the supervising department, and some was occupied under the pretext of "borrowing." According to incomplete statistics, the two enterprises had approximately 15,380 yuan in assets lost due to human factors. For example, after the Electric Heating Factory was closed, the supervising department approved the borrowing of 46 items of property, with a total value of 11,380 yuan. After the Ma Steel Factory was closed, part of its factory buildings and land were occupied by the township's casting factory and relevant departments for an extended period, without paying rent or transferring debts.

The loss and damage of assets in closed enterprises have also severely affected the recovery of bank loans, disrupting the normal economic order. To date, the two enterprises still owe 532,600 yuan in bank loans, which cannot be recovered. In this regard, it is suggested that the supervising departments of the enterprises take timely measures to strengthen the management of closed enterprises, establish and improve follow-up measures, and quickly organize efforts to conduct a thorough inventory and verification of the assets of closed enterprises, minimizing the loss of enterprise assets to the greatest extent possible.

　　部分关停企业资产损失严重
    一些乡镇企业在关停倒闭后，因善后工作未跟上，加之缺少必要的管理措施，致使企业资产大量流失、受损。湖北省松滋县西斋镇马铁厂和电加热厂两个企业，先后于１９８４年４月和１９８７年１２月关停。关停时，共有资产总额８０．５４万元，时值今日，两企业原有资产几乎损失殆尽，仅剩几间破旧的厂房和一些已严重损坏的设备，流失和损坏的资产达５３．７９万元，占关停时实有资产的６６．７９％。
    在损失的资产中，一是由于企业长期无人看管，风吹雨蚀，自然变损５２．２５万元；二是缺少必要的管理措施，企业的财产有的被偷拿，有的被主管部门无偿转让，有的以“借用”名义被人占为己有。据不完全统计，两企业资产人为流失的约１５３８０元。如电加热厂关停后，由企业主管部门批条同意，先后借出的财产共４６件，实物价值１１３８０元。马铁厂在关停倒闭后，其一部分厂房、厂地被该镇铸造厂和镇有关部门长期占用，既未交付租金，也未划转债务。
    关停企业资产的流失和损坏，也严重影响了银行贷款的清收工作，扰乱了正常的经济秩序。到目前为止，两企业尚欠银行贷款５３．２６万元，无法收回。对此，建议企业主管部门及时采取措施，加强对关停企业的管理，建立健全善后措施，并迅速组织力量，对关停企业资产进行一次彻底清理核查，把企业的资产损失减少到最低程度。
