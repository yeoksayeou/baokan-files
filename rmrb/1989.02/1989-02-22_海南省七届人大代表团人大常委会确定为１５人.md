The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on the Composition of the Hainan Provincial Delegation to the Seventh National People's Congress

February 21, 1989
The Sixth Meeting of the Seventh National People's Congress Standing Committee

Before Hainan Province was established, 13 representatives from this region were elected by the Guangdong Provincial People's Congress to serve as representatives to the Seventh National People's Congress. After Hainan Province was established, these 13 representatives became the representatives of Hainan Province to the Seventh National People's Congress. According to the decision of the National People's Congress on the number of representatives: "Provinces and autonomous regions with very small populations should have no fewer than 15 representatives." Therefore, in addition to the aforementioned 13 representatives, 2 more representatives, originally allocated by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress to the Guangdong Provincial People's Congress for election, are now allocated to Hainan Province. These 15 representatives will form the Hainan Provincial Delegation to the Seventh National People's Congress.

The number of representatives from Guangdong Province to the Seventh National People's Congress will be adjusted from 163 to 148.

　　海南省七届人大代表团人大常委会确定为１５人
    新华社北京２月２１日电  全国人民代表大会常务委员会关于海南省出席第七届全国人民代表大会代表团组成的决定
    １９８９年２月２１日第七届全国人民代表大会常务委员会第六次会议通过
    海南建省前该地区由广东省人民代表大会选举产生的１３名第七届全国人民代表大会代表，在海南建省后即为海南省第七届全国人民代表大会代表。根据全国人民代表大会关于代表名额的决议规定：“人口特少的省、自治区，代表名额不得少于１５人”。因此，除上述１３名代表外，另将原由全国人民代表大会常务委员会分配到广东省人民代表大会进行选举的２名全国人民代表大会代表名额划归海南省。由这１５名代表组成海南省出席第七届全国人民代表大会代表团。
    广东省出席第七届全国人民代表大会代表的名额，由１６３名改为１４８名。
