A Great Housing Manager – The Story of Liu Yuxiu

China has a large population. The population in Chinese cities is even larger. The shortage of housing has become a persistent problem in Langfang.

Suddenly, new buildings rose in the small city of Langfang, and hundreds of households happily moved into their new homes.

Who accomplished this feat?

The answer is: "Liu Yuxiu, General Manager of the Langfang Branch of the China Real Estate Development Company."

Liu Yuxiu was transferred to the Langfang Municipal Finance Bureau in 1983, where he served as Deputy Director and concurrently as the head of the Real Estate Department. On his first day in the Real Estate Department, his heart sank. The office was dirty and dilapidated, and the only valuable asset was an old horse-drawn cart. During heavy rains, dilapidated and leaky houses went unchecked, and residents rushed to the Real Estate Department to grab tarpaulins, carrying away dozens or even hundreds of rolls. Property was wasted, and residents still complained bitterly.

"Want a house," "want a house" ... During work hours, the office was filled with people demanding houses; after work, several people would be waiting at his home to demand houses. Those who used connections, pleaded, cried, and made a fuss ... Liu Yuxiu was driven to distraction.

Where are the houses? "Build houses, we must build houses!" Liu Yuxiu gritted his teeth in secret. But where would the money come from? Relying on financial subsidies was a dead end; low rents made it difficult to sustain the buildings, let alone build new ones?

"Build commercial housing!"

Money, he petitioned the provincial and municipal construction banks for loans to solve the problem.

A representative from the provincial construction bank came and asked, "Can you repay 46 million yuan in loans this year?"

"Sure!" Liu Yuxiu nodded firmly.

Construction teams, hired through bidding.

Suddenly, more than 40 construction teams flocked in. After several rounds of screening, 5 teams were left.

October 1985 was the most difficult time for Liu Yuxiu. It seemed as if the heavens were playing a trick on him, with the autumn rain pouring endlessly, and the construction progress slowed to a crawl. Liu Yuxiu felt like he was in a frying pan, the torment was indescribable. He needed progress and quality, and he worked day and night without rest, overworking himself to the point of illness. The doctor advised him to rest, but by the afternoon, he was gone again.

Liu Yuxiu was struggling desperately when a sudden blow came from the sky: the main structure of the building was completed, but there were two places where the rebar was exposed. The provincial inspection team ordered: stop work. At this point, stopping work was like telling Liu Yuxiu to hang himself. 46 million yuan, annual loan repayment, superiors wanted results, and the masses wanted housing. Wasn't this pushing Liu Yuxiu to his death?

Houses! Houses ...

He could not give up. If this first step was not taken, everything would be ruined. Liu Yuxiu ran around everywhere, suffering greatly.

In November 1985, 5 residential buildings stood tall in Langfang City. The construction was completed, and the first batch of commercial housing was ready. But Liu Yuxiu collapsed. Days of running around and overworking himself, the high fever did not subside. 39.8 degrees, blisters formed on his lips, and his throat was inflamed, making it difficult to eat or drink. Several female colleagues couldn't bear to watch, and they cried in the outer room. Who didn't know in their hearts how the general manager had endured this year? His once-black hair had suddenly turned so white.

Liu Yuxiu's first battle was a success: 5 buildings, constructed and completed in the same year, sold in the same year, benefited in the same year, and repaid the loan in the same year.

Liu Yuxiu succeeded. In just 3 years, the Langfang Municipal Real Estate Company built 24 commercial buildings, solving the housing problem for over 900 households. This eased the housing tension in the small city of Langfang.

　　好一个房管家
　　——刘玉秀纪事
    中国人多。中国的城市里人更多。缺房子，成了廊坊的“老大难”。
    忽然间，廊坊小城立起了新楼，数百户居民喜迁新居。
    是谁办了这么解渴的事？
    答曰：“中国房屋开发公司廊坊公司总经理——刘玉秀。”
    刘玉秀是１９８３年调到廊坊市财政局的，那时任副局长，兼任房产股股长，他上任第一天走进房产股，心里就发凉。办公室又脏又烂，整个家当就一辆马车值钱。一下大雨危房漏房没人管，居民跑到房产股抢油毡，几十捆、百八十捆地搬，财产都浪费了，居民们还叫苦连天。
    “要房”、“要房”……上班，办公室里挤满了伸手要房户；下班，家里坐等着几个伸手要房户。托关系的，求情的，哭的，闹的……刘玉秀被吵得头脑发胀。
    房子在哪？　“盖房，一定要盖房！”刘玉秀暗地里咬起牙。可钱从哪里来？靠财政补贴没出路；低房租，以房养房都困难，还能有钱盖房吗？
    “建商品房！”
    钱，请示省、地建行，要求贷款解决。
    省建行来人，４６０万元当年还贷能行吗？
    “成！”刘玉秀重重地点了点头。
    建筑队，招标聘用。
    一下子拥来了４０多个建筑队。几番筛选，留下５个队。
    １９８５年１０月是刘玉秀最艰难的时候，老天似乎专要与刘玉秀开个玩笑，秋雨下个不停，工程进度成了老牛的步子。刘玉秀如同上了油锅，那份煎熬真难形容。要进度，要质量，他日夜不歇，劳累过度，病倒了。医生嘱咐要注意休息，可下午就不见人了。
    刘玉秀正拚死努力，横空飞来一棒：楼房主体建成了，却有两处露出钢筋。省里检查团命令：停工。这时候停工，倒不如叫刘玉秀去上吊。４６０万，当年还贷款，上级要成效，群众要住房，这不是把刘玉秀往死里逼么？
    房子！房子……
    决不能趴下，这第一步走不出，一切都会完蛋。刘玉秀四处奔波，苦不堪言。
    １９８５年１１月，廊坊市５栋居民楼拔地而起。竣工了，第一批商品楼站起来了。可刘玉秀趴下了。多少天奔波劳累，高烧一直没下去。３９．８度，嘴上烧出一层火泡，喉咙发炎不进水饭。几个女同志看不下去，躲到外屋掉眼泪。哪一个人心里都有数，这一年，总经理是怎么撑过来的啊？他那满头乌发，突然间白了那么多。
    刘玉秀初战告捷：５栋楼，当年施工，当年竣工，当年出售，当年受益，当年还清贷款。
    刘玉秀成功了。仅３年的时间，廊坊市房地产公司建筑商品楼２４栋，解决居民住房９００多户。缓和了廊坊这座小城住房紧张的矛盾。
