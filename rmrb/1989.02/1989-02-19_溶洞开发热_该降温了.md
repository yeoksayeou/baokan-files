According to incomplete statistics, there are currently about 50 relatively influential scenic karst caves open to the public in China. Guangdong alone has seven, including Qixingyan, Lingxiao Rock, Yangchun Kundong Cave, Longgong Cave, Yingde Daotian Rock, and Baojing Cave. The exposed area of carbonate rocks in China is about 1.3 million square kilometers, accounting for less than 1/7 of the national territory. Hunan, Hubei, Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangxi, and Guangdong are all karst development regions in China, where caves are densely distributed, and there are numerous caves that can be developed. What is the future of cave development?

According to the author, the existing problems are very serious. First, there is a lack of scientific development planning before opening. There is no scientific analysis of the development conditions, scenic quality, and environmental scope of the caves, resulting in a high degree of blindness. Second, during construction, convenience is prioritized, leading to severe damage to the scenic resources. Many caves, when laying out tourist paths, blast away good stalactites, causing irreparable losses. Third, there is a neglect of monitoring the cave environment, and after opening, there is no clear plan for protecting the stalactite scenery. Fourth, there is dense development, and many caves are developed one after another on a single tourist line. For example, in the "Two Rivers and One Lake" scenic area in Zhejiang, which is only 200 kilometers long, there are caves of considerable scale such as Lingshan, Yaolin, and Lingqi, resulting in a repetitive "see cave—see cave—see another cave" experience.

The biggest weakness of cave scenery is its similarity. Densely developed caves should be avoided. From the current situation of blind cave development, it is essentially developing one cave and destroying another. The protection of China's cave resources has become an urgent matter.

　　“溶洞开发热”该降温了
    据不完全统计，目前我国已开放的较有影响的风景溶洞约有５０多处，仅广东就有七星岩、凌霄岩、阳春崆峒洞、龙宫洞、英德道天岩、宝晶洞六处之多。我国碳酸盐裸露面积约有１３０多万平方公里，占全国面积的１／７弱，湘、鄂、滇、黔、桂、粤等省区都是我国岩溶发育地域，溶洞呈密集型分布，可开发的溶洞多得惊人，而溶洞开发的前途又是如何呢？
    据笔者知道，存在的问题极其严重。一、开发前缺乏科学的开发论证。对洞穴的开发条件，景观质量，环境范围等没有进行科学的分析，造成很大的盲目性。二，施工中贪图方便，对景观资源破坏严重。很多洞穴在铺设旅游步道时，将很好的钟乳石炸掉，造成不可弥补的损失。三、忽视对洞内环境的监测，开放后对钟乳石景观如何保护胸中无数。四、密集型开发，不少洞穴先后开发在一条旅游线上，如浙江“两江一湖”风景名胜区，长仅２００公里，就有灵山、瑶琳、灵栖等相当规模的洞穴景区，造成“看洞——看洞——再看洞”的重复。
    洞穴景观的最大弱点是雷同性，要切忌密集型开发。从目前盲目开洞的情况看，实质上是开发一个破坏一个。对我国洞穴资源的保护，已成为当务之急。
