The problem of our school's principal, Zhao Xiangyi, issuing university diplomas to nine students who had not taken the entrance examination in 1987, cannot be left unresolved. In 1988, he not only refused to comply with the decision of the Party Committee of the Construction Department of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region to recall the diplomas and declare them invalid, but also continued to issue diplomas to 31 transfer students. Among these transfer students were his two daughters and the children of some of our school's minority faculty members, as well as children of individuals with whom he has personal connections.

Regarding Zhao Xiangyi's issue, we have reported it to the relevant departments for nearly a year. Despite the clear facts and the nature of the problem, due to Zhao Xiangyi's actions and other various reasons, the problem of our school issuing diplomas indiscriminately has not been resolved or corrected to this day.

### 我校校长的问题不能不了了之

　　我校校长的问题不能不了了之
    内蒙古建筑学校校长赵向毅１９８７年给９名未经入学考试的插班生发给了大学本科毕业证书。１９８８年，他不仅拒不执行内蒙古自治区建设厅党组让他收回毕业证，宣布所发毕业证书无效的决定，还继续给３１名插班生发了毕业证书。这些插班生中有他的两个女儿和我校少数教职工的子女，还有与他有私人关系的人的子女。
    对于赵向毅的问题，我们曾向有关部门反映了近一年，尽管事实确凿，问题的性质清楚，但由于赵向毅的活动和其它各种原因，我校滥发毕业证书的问题，至今仍得不到处理和纠正。
