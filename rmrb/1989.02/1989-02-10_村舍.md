The village is adjacent to the town. The town is named Jindian because 1,600 years ago, the imperial palace of Emperor Liu Yuan was established there. Back then, the village was home to the imperial family, so it was called Chengju. The glorious history of Chengju Village has long passed, and the villagers only find broken bricks and tiles when they dig the earth. They pick them up in anger but rarely trace the colorful past. The light of history seems to sigh only under the ground.

Who would have thought that the blood of the villagers also flows with the essence of history? The houses in the village are evidence of this. Although they are all very old, they still exude the extraordinary aura of their ancestors. The village has many courtyard houses. Most of these courtyard houses are brick-packed rooms with tiled roofs, and they even have intricate designs like five-carved beams and seven-carved beams. The most prosperous family in the village has a two-story house, with the first floor being a flat-roofed house and the second floor being a tiled house. This is the earliest two-story building in the countryside. Near the north bank of the Mother-Son River, there is a famous house called Chuangqian Courtyard. It is a row of two buildings facing east and west, divided into upper and lower courtyards. The upper and lower courtyards are further divided into front, middle, rear, and end courtyards. One courtyard is nested within another, and each courtyard is densely packed with tiled courtyard houses. This courtyard house has a reception hall, dining room, main hall, study, and even a workshop for pickled vegetables, tofu, and fermented beans in the end courtyard.

After the land reform, Chuangqian Courtyard changed owners. One household became dozens, and the past tranquility was completely shattered. Neighbors to the east and west would bump noses when they went out the door, feeling that the courtyard was too small to even breathe. Raising chickens, ducks, pigs, and sheep had no space. Children would run in and out, and over time, even spoons and strainers would bump into each other. Someone secretly saved money and planned to build a new house. This is a long-standing habit in the village: once there is money, the first thing to consider is the house.

At this time, the "Communist Wind" blew. Someone said that all property would be nationalized. An outsider, Wang San, hearing the news, sold his three eastern rooms cheaply and moved in with his daughter. This old man had foresight; that year, he had just sold the land he had divided, and during the cooperativization, he had a good time with money in his waist. This time, he wanted to seize the opportunity again and find a cheap house to live in. The "Communist Wind" did blow, but public ownership, communal dining, and learning from Dazhai seemed far away. Unfortunately, Wang San waited until his hair turned white but never saw the day. In the end, he died in his daughter's house. But he did live in a new house with wooden walls, though he had to buy it with his own money.

The enthusiasm for building houses finally erupted. And when the land was redistributed to the farmers, the farmers tilled the land beautifully, like an embroidered quilt. After filling their stomachs and having some money in hand, the money, following the ancestral spirit in their blood, was spent on houses. In a few years, the old courtyard houses in the village disappeared. A row of newly built houses covered the old ones completely. These new houses have tiled houses with bricks up to the eaves; cave dwellings with green brick arches; flat-roofed houses with reinforced concrete; and even high-rise buildings. Whether they are tiled houses, cave dwellings, flat-roofed houses, or high-rise buildings, the walls are higher, seeking spaciousness; the windows are larger, seeking brightness. A magnificent new village appeared before everyone's eyes. The stagnant air in the courtyard houses turned into laughter that bounced out. The worried faces inside and outside the village turned into smiling faces. The smiling faces were still planning big things, discussing this row for the eldest son, that row for the second son, and still had to build a row for the third son...

The smiling faces were still as hardworking and thrifty as before, saving even a few cents to buy a brick to add to the wall. Even if they had to borrow money to buy seeds and fertilizer, the money for building walls was not to be touched. Thus, the walls grew higher day by day, and the new houses increased day by day, the village expanded day by day, and the land decreased day by day.

Fortunately, someone saw the tragedy of the village and, with a beardless chin raised, called out: "Don't pour money into houses anymore, let's pool our resources to set up a factory, let money become a 'money-laying hen'." The smiling faces laughed at this person as if he were Wang San reincarnated, laughed about Wang San's funny stories, and together cursed this person an "ungrateful son." The ungrateful son was not bothered and was willing to be rebellious. In his heart, another kind of village had sprouted, a village completely different from the past thousand years, a village with the roar of machines and the appearance of a city.

The ungrateful son had awakened a group of ungrateful sons. The ungrateful sons worked together to turn the village before their eyes into history as quickly as possible.

　　村舍
　　乔忠延
    这村子紧靠镇子。镇子只因１６００年前扎过刘渊皇帝的金銮宝殿，得名金殿。村子里那会儿住过皇城的宝眷，因而唤作城居。城居村的光辉历史早已过去，村民们只在掘土锄田时，发现黄土地下有很多碎砖瓦砾。于是愤然俯身捡去，却很少有人追寻那多彩的往事。历史之光似乎只有在地下叹息了。
    何曾想到，在村人的血脉中也流溢着历史的精气。村中的屋舍就是明证。虽然都很古旧，可也透出祖上不凡的气宇。这村里多是四合院。四合院又多是砖包房子简瓦厦，还讲究五镂搭挂、七镂搭挂什么的。村中那最盛的人家，一层是平房，二层是瓦房，这便是乡间最早的楼房。紧靠母子河北沿，有个闻名的穿钱院。东西向一溜两排，分为上院下院。上下院又有前院，中院，后院，尾院。一院套一院，每院都是密密实实的四合瓦房。这瓦房分客厅，饭堂，正堂，书房，尾院里还有酱醋豆腐作坊。
    闹了土改，穿钱院换了主人。一户变成了几十户，上下院，前后院，往昔的宁静彻底破碎了。东邻西舍，出门就能碰了鼻子尖，觉得这院小得气儿都出不直。养个鸡呀鸭呀猪呀羊呀也没地盘。娃儿们更是南门进，北门出，乱跑乱窜，日子久了勺子笊篱还能不磕碰？便有人私下里攒钱，谋划置产立业的盖房大计。这是村上祖祖辈辈的习惯，有了钱首先盘算的就是房舍。
    这当儿，共产风来了。有人说房产全要归公。外来户王三闻风贱卖了三间东厦，挤到女儿家去了。这老头有眼力，那年刚卖了分来的土地，合作化了，腰里揣着钱过了不少酒肉日子。这回又想投个机，再拣个便宜房子住。共产风倒是不停地刮，公社化，食堂饭，学大寨，看来住公房的日子不会远。偏偏王三熬白了眉毛也没盼上，最后竟在女儿家中过世。但又毕竟最后住进了一所四壁木香的新房，不过是自家掏钱买。盖房的热劲到底迸发出来了。并在一块的土地分还到庄户人手里，庄稼人把地扑弄得绣花被一样好看。吃饱了肚子，手头里有了活钱，钱就随着祖上留在血脉中的精气，输送到房舍上了。几年工夫，村中那些古旧的四合院看不见了。一排排新盖的房屋，将老舍遮了个严实。这新房有瓦房，一砖到檐；有窑洞，青砖拱圈；有平房，现浇灌注；也有楼房，高高耸立。不论是瓦房，窑洞，还是平房，楼房，墙更高了，图个宽敞；窗更大了，图个亮堂。一个气气派派的新农村展现在眼前。在四合院里憋陈了的闷气，都化作朗朗笑声蹦跳出来。村里村外，进进出出的愁容变成了笑脸。笑脸们又笑着谋划大计，划来划去还是盖房子。这一排留给大小子，那一排送给二小子，还得给三小子盖一排……笑脸们还像先前一样勤劳，一样节俭，省下五分钱，也有买一块砖垒到墙上去的。哪怕买种子，买化肥时东挪西借，反正垒墙的钱一点也不准挪动。于是屋墙一天天加高，新房一天天增多，村舍一天天外延，土地一天天减少。
    好在有人看到了村舍的悲剧，扬着没胡子的下巴呼吁：别再把钱往房上塞了，集中起来办个工厂吧，让钱变成“生蛋变钱”的母鸡。笑脸们大笑这人是王三再世，笑谈王三的趣事，齐声骂这人“逆子”。逆子毫不在意，甘心叛逆。他的心头已萌生出另一种村舍，一种同千百年来截然不同的村舍，一种机器轰鸣的城市模样的村舍。
    逆子已唤醒一批逆子。逆子们共同努力，要把眼前的村舍尽快变成历史。
