The last official speech given by Panchen Erdeni Qoinjye Gyatso, Vice Chairman, at the opening ceremony of the Panchen Lama's Soul Tower and Memorial Hall, where the remains of the Fifth to Ninth Panchen Lamas are interred, is a significant historical record. In this speech, Panchen Vice Chairman discussed the destruction of the remains, soul towers, and memorial halls of the Panchen Lamas during the "Cultural Revolution" and the reconstruction of the soul tower and memorial hall, emphasizing that this "magnificent and grand soul tower and memorial hall" is a symbol of the correctness and authenticity of the Chinese Communist Party's policy on ethnic minorities and religion, a symbol of unity between the Tibetan and Han peoples, and a symbol of patriotism among Tibetan religious circles and the broad masses of monks and laypeople.

The full text of Panchen Master's speech is as follows:

Honorable leaders, distinguished guests, comrades, and friends:

Today, we solemnly commence the opening ceremony of the Panchen Lama's Soul Tower and Memorial Hall, where the remains of the Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth Panchen Lamas are interred, at the sacred site of Tashilhunpo Monastery in the rear of Tibet.

At this grand ceremony, I am deeply honored by the presence of leaders from various relevant departments of the central government, led by Comrade Hu Jintao, leaders from various levels of the Party, government, and military in the Tibet Autonomous Region, and responsible comrades from relevant departments. Additionally, leaders from Qinghai, Gansu, Sichuan, Yunnan, and other brother provinces, as well as their subordinate autonomous prefectures and counties, as well as representatives of living Buddhas, Geshes, and various monasteries from Tibetan and Mongolian areas, have all come to celebrate despite the long journey and high-altitude challenges. This fully demonstrates the importance and care given by the central government, all levels of the Party and government, and all religious figures and the broad masses of believers to the successful reconstruction of the Panchen Lama's Soul Tower and Memorial Hall, where the remains of the Fifth to Ninth Panchen Lamas are interred. Your presence has greatly enhanced the splendor of our opening ceremony. We are filled with joy and inspiration. Please allow me, as the abbot of Tashilhunpo Monastery and honorary chairman of the Management Committee, to represent the Management Committee and all the monks, living Buddhas, and staff of Tashilhunpo Monastery, as well as the entire staff of the Tibet Jianjian Development Company, to express our warm welcome and heartfelt thanks to you on behalf of the Reconstruction Leadership Group of the Panchen Lama's Soul Tower and Memorial Hall. We also extend our highest respect to you.

At this historically significant and emotionally charged moment, as the tenth Panchen Erdeni Qoinjye Gyatso, the natural successor of the Panchen Lamas, I am deeply moved and have much to say. First, I would like to briefly report on the background and process of the reconstruction of the new Panchen Lama's Soul Tower and Memorial Hall.

Everyone knows that Tashilhunpo Monastery in the rear of Tibet is one of the four great monasteries of Tibet, one of the six great monasteries of the Gelugpa sect, and a center for the propagation of the Gelugpa teachings. Since the fourth Panchen Lama, Losang Ch√∂kyi Gyaltsen, it has been the main monastery where the Panchen Lamas independently manage religious and political affairs, and it is also one of the key national cultural relics protected by the State Council. Originally, it housed the statue of the Dharmaraja Rootunzhu, the world's largest gilded statue of Jampa, the laughing Maitreya, the red-robed speaking Tara, the golden vajra-holding protector, and countless other Buddha statues, stupas, and scriptures. In particular, the soul tower of Dharmaraja Rootunzhu and the soul towers of the fourth to ninth Panchen Lamas, along with their memorial halls, shone like the sun and moon, blessing all beings. Therefore, in 1960, the State Council listed Tashilhunpo Monastery as one of the first batch of key national cultural relics for protection and made it public.

However, during the ten-year catastrophe of the "Cultural Revolution," the Buddha statues, stupas, and scriptures of Tashilhunpo Monastery were destroyed on a massive scale. In particular, the remains, soul towers, and memorial halls of the Panchen Lamas were completely destroyed, causing a very bad impression both domestically and internationally, with serious consequences. This is because, from a religious perspective, the Panchen Lamas were all deeply versed in the vast teachings of exoteric and esoteric Buddhism, becoming great masters who upheld and propagated the Dharma, revered by countless devotees as religious leaders, and one of the patriarchs of Tibetan Buddhism. From a political perspective, the Panchen Erdenis all loved their country and made outstanding historical contributions to the great cause of maintaining national unity and ethnic unity, as well as internal unity among the Tibetan people. For example, the sixth Panchen Erdeni, Padan Yishy, to strengthen and develop the relationship between the local government of Tibet and the central government, and to deepen the fraternal bonds between the Tibetan people and the various ethnic groups of the motherland, he undertook a long and arduous journey, crossing mountains and rivers, leading thousands of followers to the capital to pay homage to the emperor on his 70th birthday, and to discuss religious and state affairs. He received special honors and generous rewards from the Qianlong Emperor. For this patriotic deed, he unfortunately fell ill and passed away in Beijing. His great achievements are recorded in history and will be forever praised by posterity. Again, the ninth Panchen Erdeni, Choekyi Nyima, in the face of the British imperialists' attempts to lure and threaten him, using both soft and hard tactics, trying to use him to realize their plot to separate Tibet from China, he took a firm patriotic stand and told the invaders in righteous words: Tibet belongs to China, and he would not betray China by signing any agreement related to Tibet's future with anyone; he also firmly maintained internal unity in Tibet, clearly telling the invaders: according to the old customs, major Tibetan affairs must be discussed by the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama. Now that the 13th Dalai Lama is not in Tibet, he alone cannot make decisions. Such high moral character and a firm stance in maintaining national unity and ethnic unity set an example for future generations. Later, due to the intensifying contradictions between patriots and imperialists in Tibet, and between unity and secession, the ninth Panchen Lama was forced to leave Tibet. During his 15 years of residence in the interior of the motherland, he tirelessly traveled throughout the country, proclaiming that Tibet is an inseparable part of the motherland's territory, and exposing at any time the separatist activities of imperialists and their agents in Tibet, becoming an outstanding representative and a glorious banner of the patriotic forces in Tibet. The destruction of the soul towers of these great patriotic religious leaders, whose names are recorded in history, and the demolition of their memorial halls, seriously damaged the reputation of our Party and government both domestically and internationally, and also hurt the feelings of the broad masses of believers, becoming a major concern. In view of this, as the natural successor of the Panchen Lamas and a firm patriot, I took the initiative to undertake the responsibility of reconstructing the soul towers of the Panchen Lamas, which is a mission that history has entrusted to me. When I returned to my own monastery, Tashilhunpo, in 1982, after being away for 18 years, due to the great care and concern of the Party Central Committee and the sincere expectations and welcome of the Tibetan people, some believers and upright individuals presented to me the remains of the Panchen Lamas, which they had secretly buried and preserved at the risk of their lives during the "Cultural Revolution," and strongly requested: "You are the sole owner of these remains. Please rebuild the soul towers and memorial halls as soon as possible so that these remains can be re-enshrined." At the same time, the broad masses of believers, mainly from the Tibetan and Mongolian regions, both domestically and internationally, strongly demanded the reconstruction of the soul towers and memorial halls of the Panchen Lamas.

For this reason, I proposed to the central leaders that the remains of the five Panchen Erdenis, which had been destroyed, be reburied together, and a magnificent and grand soul tower and memorial hall be built. The cost would be borne by the state, and the project would be jointly managed by the Tibet Autonomous Region People's Government, Tashilhunpo Monastery, and myself. I would mainly be responsible for the reconstruction of the new soul tower. The central leaders attached great importance to and sympathized with this proposal, and the central government formally approved my request. Subsequently, under my personal supervision, a leadership and executive body for the reconstruction of the new soul tower was established, a plan was formulated, and in nearly four years, with the support of all parties, especially with the strong assistance and cooperation of the Party and government leaders of Shigatse, the leadership and staff of the reconstruction of the new soul tower and memorial hall, the broad masses of Tibetan and Han engineers and workers, and through their arduous efforts, the new task was completed according to the original standards, and the soul tower and its memorial hall were named "Panchen Lama's Soul Tower and Memorial Hall, Tashilhunpo." The cost of this magnificent project was mainly borne by the state, and Tashilhunpo Monastery also raised a large sum of money, with the remaining amount being supplemented by the Tibet Jianjian Company. Here, I would like to express my thanks to the Party and the state once again.

Next, I would like to share my personal views on the destruction of the remains, soul towers, and memorial halls of the Panchen Lamas during the "Cultural Revolution" and their reconstruction under the care and support of the Party and the state, or to reaffirm some of my views.

(1) The soul towers of the Panchen Lamas in Tashilhunpo Monastery, as well as many Buddha statues, stupas, and scriptures, and most of the temples in Tibet and the Tibetan areas, were mainly destroyed during the "Cultural Revolution" and other political movements. From the perspective of Tibet, especially from the perspective of temples as places for the preservation, inheritance, and dissemination of Tibetan culture, and from the perspective of the Tibetan people's sincere belief and strong religious feelings, the policy of destroying temples, eliminating Buddha statues, stupas, and scriptures, etc., was wrong both globally and locally, and the consequences were undoubtedly serious. However, the problems that occurred in Tibet and other Tibetan areas were not isolated incidents aimed at us. From a national perspective, from the perspective of other ethnic minority areas, the "Cultural Revolution" was a disaster shared by all 56 ethnic groups in the country, including the Han people. It cannot be said that the destruction of the "Cultural Revolution" was specifically aimed at the Tibetans or Tibet, nor can it be said that it was the Han people destroying Tibetan culture. Can it be said that the destruction and losses suffered by the Han people were the Han people destroying their own culture? Therefore, using the destruction of the "Cultural Revolution," especially the destruction of religious temples, to incite ethnic sentiments and provoke ethnic relations, is purely malicious.

(2) The "Cultural Revolution" was a historical mistake and disaster. In history, there have been many such disasters. For example, in the Tubo Kingdom period, King Langdarma once destroyed Buddhism and annihilated Tibetan culture represented by the Tibetan script. From a global perspective, we can still see the ancient cultural sites of Rome, Maya, Babylon, etc., which were not all caused by historical storms or disasters? Using such historical disasters to create sensational public opinion, and even exaggerating them into so-called "genocide," is also malicious.

(3) Our restoration and opening of temples are mainly to meet the religious needs of the broad masses of believers and to inherit and carry forward the teachings of Buddhism. It is not to restore and open temples for the sake of opening them, nor is it to restore and open them in the old way of the former society. I have said before that the number of temples is not important, but whether they can become places for the inheritance and promotion of Buddhist teachings, and whether they can become places for the practice of abandoning evil and accumulating merit, self-discipline, and benefiting others according to Buddhist teachings; the number of monks and nuns is not important, but whether their qualities are pure, whether they can strictly observe the rules and precepts, and whether they can carry out the transmission and practice of the exoteric and esoteric teachings according to the basic requirements of hearing, thinking, and practicing, and debating and writing, truly according to the teachings of Buddha Shakyamuni and Tsongkhapa, and pass down the Buddhist teachings.

(4) The core of Buddhist teachings is to refrain from all evil, to practice all good, to purify one's mind, to protect the country, to benefit sentient beings, and to accumulate merit. The important purpose of our reconstruction of the Panchen Lama's Soul Tower is to carry forward the spirit of the Panchen Lamas in religious practice of purifying the mind and upholding and propagating the Dharma, and in politics of maintaining a patriotic stance and striving for the prosperity of the country and the happiness of the people, so as to commemorate the kindness of the Panchen Lamas, as the proverb says, "The biographies of the sages are our models, and we should follow their example," not only should we strive to practice their good deeds, but also educate and influence future generations, not for the sake of decoration and fame. Otherwise, we will be unworthy of the Panchen Lamas.

Again, I would like to take this opportunity to discuss the political significance of the reconstruction of the soul tower and memorial hall where the remains of the Fifth to Ninth Panchen Lamas are interred.

I have mentioned before that the Panchen Lama's Soul Tower and Memorial Hall, Tashilhunpo, was built under the high attention and care of the central government, with the strong support and assistance of the Party Committee and the People's Government of the Tibet Autonomous Region, and with the active participation and assistance of the Shigatse Party and government, and relevant departments. It was built through the joint efforts of the Reconstruction Leadership Group and the Executive Office of the Soul Tower and Memorial Hall, as well as all Tibetan and Han cadres, engineers, workers, and laborers, overcoming difficulties and working tirelessly, through careful design and construction. Therefore, I can say without exaggeration that the Panchen Lama's Soul Tower and Memorial Hall, Tashilhunpo, this magnificent and grand soul tower and memorial hall, is a symbol of the correctness and authenticity of the Chinese Communist Party's policy on ethnic minorities and religion, a symbol of unity between the Tibetan and Han peoples, a symbol of patriotism among Tibetan religious circles and the broad masses of monks and laypeople, and a crystallization of the joint labor of the Tibetan and Han peoples. I am fully convinced that anyone who comes to the mausoleum to pay respects, visit, and tour, as long as they respect the facts, will surely understand the essence of the Party's policy on ethnic minorities and religion, understand the importance of Tibetan-Han unity, and understand the significance of maintaining a patriotic stance. I believe that the principles contained in the Panchen Lama's Soul Tower and Memorial Hall, Tashilhunpo, this magnificent memorial hall, will continue to shine in the process of Tibet and the Tibetan areas advancing on the road of unity, progress, and development.

Before concluding my speech, I would like to express my highest respect once again to the leaders of the central government and Tibet who have cared for and supported the reconstruction of the Panchen Lama's Soul Tower and Memorial Hall, Tashilhunpo! I would like to pay my respects to the Party, government, and military leaders of Shigatse who have coordinated and assisted! I would like to pay my respects to the staff of the soul tower project and the Tashilhunpo system who have worked tirelessly and actively! I would like to pay my respects to all the leaders, guests, believers, comrades, and friends who have come to participate in the opening ceremony of the Panchen Lama's Soul Tower and Memorial Hall despite the long journey and the challenges of high altitude!

Finally, I wish everyone present good health, smooth work, and good fortune.
