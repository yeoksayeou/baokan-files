National People's Congress Standing Committee members today, during the review of the drafts of the Import and Export Commodity Inspection Law and the Infectious Disease Prevention and Control Law, believed that after repeated revisions and modifications, these two legal drafts are basically mature and suggested that the current session of the Standing Committee approve them.

During the group meetings of the sixth session of the Seventh National People's Congress Standing Committee held yesterday afternoon and this morning, members discussed these two legal drafts.

Regarding the Import and Export Commodity Inspection Law, Commissioner Yi Meihou said that the revised inspection law has more substantial content, clearer provisions, and is more reasonable and comprehensive compared to the original draft, especially in terms of protecting national interests, trade interests, and enterprise rights, which have been clearly regulated. This will play a very important role in strengthening the management of imported and exported commodities and promoting the development of foreign trade. Commissioner Hu Daiguang said that the inspection law has been revised well and suggested its approval. He pointed out that in the future implementation, several issues need attention: first, to establish the authority of the inspection agencies and improve their status; second, to improve the quality of inspection personnel and build a high-quality inspection team; third, to strengthen the seriousness, scientific nature, and feasibility of the commodity classification list; fourth, to regulate in the implementation rules or relevant departments the approval procedures and conditions for foreign countries to establish inspection agencies in China. Commissioner Yang Lieyu suggested adding "safety and hygiene" regulations in the inspection law. He said that including "safety and hygiene" as inspection content is an international practice, and China's standardization law also regulates this. If the inspection law does not regulate this, it will make the inspection department evade the responsibilities it should bear.

In reviewing the draft of the Infectious Disease Prevention and Control Law, Commissioners Hu Jiewei, Zhu Dexi, Chen Shengheng, Li Ruishan, Song Chengzhi, and Chu Zhuang suggested that the draft should clearly stipulate the timely and truthful disclosure of major epidemics. This is to be responsible to the international community, to the people, and is also the responsibility and power of the health administration department. If not disclosed in a timely manner, it will cause rumors to spread, leading to public panic. Commissioners Zhang Shiming, Wu Jutian, Zhou Zhan'ao, Yang Bo, and Yang Lieyu believed that the law should still be named the "Infectious Disease Prevention and Control Law." Commissioner Zhou Zhan'ao said that in recent years, some medical personnel have seen a decline in their service attitude, requiring gifts for treatment and surgeries, and charging high deposits. Some medical personnel have a harsh attitude and do not care about the people's suffering. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the ideological education of medical personnel.

　　商品检验法传染病法草案基本成熟    
    人大常委会委员建议本次会议通过
    新华社北京２月１７日电  全国人大常委会委员今天在审议进出口商品检验法草案和传染病防治法草案时认为，经过反复审议、修改后的这两部法律草案基本成熟，建议本次常委会议予以通过。
    在昨天下午和今天上午举行的七届全国人大常委会第六次会议分组会上，委员们就这两部法律草案进行了审议。
    关于进出口商品检验法，蚁美厚委员说，修改后的商检法内容比较充实，条文比较明确，比原草案更加合理和全面，特别是对维护国家利益、贸易各方面的利益、企业权益等方面都作了比较明确的规定。这对加强进出口商品的管理，促进对外贸易的发展，将起十分重要的作用。胡代光委员说，商检法修改得比较好，建议通过。今后执行中应注意几个问题，一要注意树立商检机构的权威，提高商检机构的地位；二要注意提高商检人员的素质，建立一支高质量的商检队伍；三要注意加强种类表的严肃性、科学性和可行性；四是注意在实施细则或在有关部门中，规定外国在国内设立商检机构的批准程序、条件等。杨烈宇委员建议，在商检法中应增加“安全、卫生”的规定。他说，把“安全、卫生”作为商检内容，这是国际通例，我国的标准化法中也对此作了规定。如果商检法对此不作规定，就会使商检部门逃避了应承担的责任。
    在审议传染病防治法草案中，胡绩伟、朱德熙、陈邃衡、李瑞山、宋承志、楚庄等委员建议，草案中应明确规定，坚持将重大疫情及时、如实地公布。这样做，一是对国际社会负责，二是对人民负责，也是卫生行政部门的责任和权力。若不及时公布，就会造成小道消息传播，以讹传讹，议论纷纷，造成人们的恐慌心理。章师明、伍觉天、周占鳌、杨波、杨烈宇等委员认为，这个法还是称“传染病防治法”为好。周占鳌委员说，近几年有些医务人员为人民服务的思想水平下降，看病、动手术都要送礼，付高额押金。还有些医务人员态度生硬，不关心人民疾苦。因此，要切实加强医务人员的思想教育。
