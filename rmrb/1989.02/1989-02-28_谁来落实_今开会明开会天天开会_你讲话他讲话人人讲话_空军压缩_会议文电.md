	Who will implement the decisions?
	Meetings today, meetings tomorrow, meetings every day,
	You speak, he speaks, everyone speaks.
	The Air Force is reducing meetings and documents.

	Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 27 (Reporter Sun Maoqing): “Meetings today, meetings tomorrow, meetings every day, you speak, he speaks, everyone speaks, who will implement the decisions?” This is a couplet recently quoted by Air Force Political Commissar Zhu Guang when he urged the Air Force leadership to lead by example in simplifying meetings and documents.

	At the end and beginning of the year, various departments of the Air Force held meetings to summarize and deploy work. The main leaders of the Air Force did not attend these meetings and required the leadership to strictly control the number and scale of meetings from a macro perspective this year. Meetings that can be avoided will be firmly canceled, saving expenses and freeing up leaders from the burden of excessive meetings and documents to conduct in-depth investigations and research in the troops.

	It is understood that the Air Force Headquarters recently combined the originally planned separate meetings on operations, training, management, and education into one. The Party Committee of the Air Force Political Department decided to reduce the 32 meetings planned for 1989 to 13, and stipulated that various business departments are not allowed to convene unscheduled meetings at will, and second-level departments are not allowed to issue directive faxes, setting a good example for all levels of departments to simplify meetings and documents with practical actions.

    谁来落实
　　今开会明开会天天开会
    你讲话他讲话人人讲话
    空军压缩
    会议文电
    新华社北京２月２７日电  （记者孙茂庆）“今开会明开会天天开会，你讲话他讲话人人讲话，谁来落实。”这是空军政委朱光最近要求空军领导机关带头精简会议文电时引用的一副对联。
    岁末年初，空军机关各部门分别召开了总结部署工作的会议，空军主要领导同志都没有陪会，还要求领导机关今年要从宏观上严格控制会议数量和规模，能不开的会坚决不开，节约经费开支，并使领导干部从文山会海中解脱出来，深入部队调查研究。
    据了解，空军司令部为压缩会议，最近将原准备分别召开的作战、训练、管理教育会议合起来开。空军政治部党委作出决定，将１９８９年计划召开的３２个会议压缩到１３个，并规定各业务部门不得随意召开计划外会议，二级部不得发指令性传真电报，以实际行动为各级机关精简会议文电带个好头。
