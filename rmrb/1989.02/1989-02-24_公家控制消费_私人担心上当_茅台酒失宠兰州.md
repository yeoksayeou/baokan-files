State control of consumption and individuals' fear of being duped have led to Maotai wine losing its popularity in Lanzhou. The Xinhua News Agency reported from Lanzhou on February 23 that during the Spring Festival market in Lanzhou, Maotai wine was not well-received. The Lanzhou Sugar, Wine, and Foodstuffs Wholesale Company prepared 200 cases (each case containing 12 bottles) for the Spring Festival market, but only one case was purchased by an air force unit. The wholesale company opened one case and placed it in a store for trial sales. From before the Spring Festival to after the Lantern Festival, not a single bottle was sold.

The manager of the wholesale company is worried about the 400,000 yuan tied up in this batch of Maotai wine, saying, "It's not just the price. Even after the price adjustment last year, we sold quite a bit at this price."

"A good thing, indicating that collective consumption is being controlled!" said a deputy secretary of the provincial government.

"This indicates that the tightening of monetary policy has stabilized the market, and people feel that the yuan is valuable again," said a senior economist from the People's Bank.

Individual entrepreneurs, who were once thought to be able to "afford and give away" Maotai, why don't they buy it now? The manager of a certain private enterprise with substantial wealth explained, "There are three reasons: First, banks are tightening credit. Second, 'nine out of ten bottles of Maotai are fake.' Third, giving a friend a bottle of Maotai is less practical than giving his child 200 yuan for the New Year."

　　公家控制消费　私人担心上当
    茅台酒失宠兰州
    新华社兰州２月２３日电  （记者王安）在兰州春节市场，茅台酒受到冷遇。市糖酒副食批发公司为春节市场准备的２００件（每件１２瓶），至今被空军一个单位买去一件，批发公司拆开一件放在一家商店试销，从春节前摆到元宵节后，一瓶也没卖掉。
    批发公司负责人被这批茅台酒占用的４０多万元弄得忧心忡忡，说：“不光是价格的原因。去年调价后这样的价格也卖出过不少。”
    “这是件好事，说明社会集团消费被控制了！”省政府一位副秘书长这么看。
    “这说明银根抽紧后，市场稳定了，人们觉得人民币又顶用了。”人民银行一位高级经济师这样说。
    向来被认为“喝得起、送得起”茅台的个体户，为何也不买呢？腰缠万贯的某私营企业经理解释说：“有三个原因：一是银行卡得紧。二是‘十瓶茅台九瓶假’。三是给好朋友送瓶茅台酒，还不如给他家小孩２００块压岁钱实惠。”
