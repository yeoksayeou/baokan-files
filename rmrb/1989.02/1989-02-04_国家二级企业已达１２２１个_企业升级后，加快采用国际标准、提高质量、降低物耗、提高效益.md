The People's Daily reports: Correspondent Jiang Shaogao reports: The reporter learned from the Office of the State Council's Enterprise Management Guidance Commission that in the past two years, significant progress has been made in enterprise upgrading. Currently, there are 1,221 national second-class enterprises that have been approved. These enterprises have emerged during the deepening of reforms and strengthening of management, representing the advanced level in various domestic industries.

In July 1986, the State Council issued the "Decision on Several Issues Regarding Strengthening Industrial Enterprise Management," proposing that during the "Seventh Five-Year Plan" period, improving product quality, reducing material consumption, and increasing economic benefits should be the main indicators for evaluating the management level of industrial enterprises. It also proposed the main indicators for national first-class enterprises, national second-class enterprises, and provincial (autonomous region, municipality) advanced enterprises. Over the past two years, various regions have generally emphasized the basic work of "managing and upgrading." According to statistics from 19 industrial departments, 387 national-level enterprise standards have been formulated, accounting for 86% of the total standards to be formulated. In 21 provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities), 6,582 provincial-level advanced industrial enterprise standards have been formulated, accounting for 84% of the total standards to be formulated. With the enterprise upgrading standards in place, enterprises have clear targets to strive for, and various management tasks are more targeted. More and more management cadres and enterprise employees have come to realize that the State Council's decision to carry out the "manage and upgrade" activity is an effective measure taken to address the situation where our country's enterprises are "technologically backward and management is even more backward." For various regions and departments, it is an important means to strengthen industry management and improve industry management levels; for enterprises and employees, it is an important incentive mechanism.

On a large scale and universally, formulating our country's quality standards and material consumption standards for leading industrial products according to international standards is a great promotion for enterprises to catch up with and surpass international advanced levels and accelerate the adoption of international standards.

The Ministry of Metallurgy conducted a statistical analysis of 11 national second-class steel enterprises, comparing 1987 with the pre-upgrading year of 1985. The proportion of products reaching international general standards, advanced standards, and national and ministerial excellent products increased from 30.13% to 59.73%; the comparable energy consumption per ton of steel decreased by 43 kilograms of standard coal, and realized tax revenue increased by 27.4%. According to the analysis of the mechanical industry on the qualification situation of 940 main products of national second-class enterprises in 1987, 103 products reached the international contemporary level, accounting for 11% of the evaluated products; 433 products reached the advanced level of the late 1970s and early 1980s, accounting for 46%; the remaining 402 products all reached or were equivalent to the international general standard level, accounting for 43%.

Currently, the units that have been upgraded to national second-class enterprises are only a few in each industry, and the number that can be upgraded to national first-class and special-class enterprises will be even fewer. A responsible comrade from the Office of the State Council's Enterprise Management Guidance Commission said that this year, we will further promote the work of enterprise upgrading and continue to revise and improve national-level enterprise standards. To ensure that this work proceeds steadily and that enterprises focus on management, national-level enterprises must stabilize at one level for a period before applying for a higher level. The assessment of enterprise upgrading should simplify procedures, ensure assessment quality, reduce enterprise burdens, and resolutely prevent and resist various improper practices in enterprise upgrading assessments. At the same time, regardless of the level of advanced enterprises, there will be no "lifetime" status, and those that do not meet the standards will be demoted.

　　国家二级企业已达１２２１个
　　企业升级后，加快采用国际标准、提高质量、降低物耗、提高效益
    本报讯  记者江绍高报道：记者从国务院企业管理指导委员会办公室获悉：两年多来的企业升级工作取得显著成绩，现在全国已审定的国家二级企业达１２２１个。这批企业是在深化改革、加强管理中涌现出来的，代表了国内各行业先进水平。
    国务院１９８６年７月作出《加强工业企业管理若干问题的决定》，提出：“七五”期间，要把提高产品质量、降低物质消耗和增加经济效益，作为考核工业企业管理水平的主要指标，并提出了国家特级企业、国家一级企业、国家二级企业和省（自治区、直辖市）级先进企业的主要指标。这两年，各地普遍重视了“抓管理、上等级”的基础工作。据对１９个工业部门统计，已制订出３８７个国家级企业标准，占应制订标准总数的８６％。２１个省（自治区、直辖市）也制订出６５８２个省级先进工业企业标准，占应制订标准总数的８４％。有了企业升级标准，企业就有了明确的攀登目标，各项管理工作就更有针对性。越来越多的管理干部和企业职工认识到，国务院决定开展“抓管理、上等级”的活动，是针对我国企业“技术落后、管理更落后”所采取的有效措施，对各地区、各部门来讲，是加强行业管理，提高行业管理水平的重要手段；对企业和职工来讲，是一个重要的激励机制。
    大规模地、普遍地按照国际标准制订我国工业主导产品质量标准和物耗标准，对于企业赶超国际先进水平，加快采用国际标准，是一个很大的促进。
    冶金部对１１个国家二级钢铁企业作过统计，１９８７年与升级前的１９８５年相比，产品质量达到国际一般标准、先进标准和国优、部优产品的比例由３０．１３％增加到５９．７３％；吨钢可比能耗下降４３公斤标煤，实现利税增长２７．４％。据机械行业对１９８７年度国家二级企业９４０种主要产品达标情况的分析，达到国际当代水平的１０３种，占考核产品的１１％；达到国际７０年代末８０年代初先进水平的有４３３种，占４６％；其余４０２种全部达到或相当于国际通用标准水平，占４３％。
    当前，升为国家二级企业的单位只是各行业中的少数，能升到国家一级、特级企业的数量将会更少。国务院企业管理指导委员会办公室负责同志说，今年，要进一步抓好企业升级工作，继续修订、完善国家级企业标准。为保证这一工作稳步进行，使企业把功夫下在抓管理上，对国家级企业必须在一个等级上稳定一段时间后才可申报更高等级。对企业升级的考核，要简化程序，既要保证考核质量，又要减轻企业负担，坚决制止和抵制企业升级考核中的各种不正之风。同时，不论哪一级的先进企业，都不搞“终身制”，不符合标准的就下来。
