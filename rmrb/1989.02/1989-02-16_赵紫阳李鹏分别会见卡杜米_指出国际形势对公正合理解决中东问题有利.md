Zhao Ziyang and Li Peng Meet with Kadoumi
Indicate that the international situation is favorable for a fair and reasonable resolution of the Middle East issue

BEIJING, Feb. 15 (Xinhua) — "As long as it is beneficial to promoting a just and lasting peace in the Middle East, China will, as always, do its part within its capacity," said Zhao Ziyang, general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, this afternoon at a meeting with Farouk Kaddoumi, head of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) Political Department, and his delegation in the Zhongnanhai leadership compound.

Zhao Ziyang pointed out that the overall international situation has shown a trend of easing tensions and politically resolving regional disputes. This is a good opportunity for a fair and reasonable resolution of the Middle East issue. Of course, a complex process is still needed. Under the current situation, it is necessary to mobilize the positive factors of all parties, through the efforts of all parties, to push the United States to adjust its policy and make Israel change its stance. The PLO, Arab countries, and all countries in the world that uphold justice should work together to promote the Middle East peace process. There are still many difficulties, but the future is hopeful.

Kaddoumi highly praised the decision of the Chinese leadership and the Chinese government to quickly recognize the State of Palestine. He said that China's recognition has a profound impact on the international struggle of the Palestinian people. He also said that they would not miss the good opportunity to dialogue with the United States and strive to achieve significant results. Kaddoumi condemned Israel for not changing its rigid stance to this day.

BEIJING, Feb. 15 (Xinhua) — Premier Li Peng met with Farouk Kaddoumi, head of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) Political Department, and his delegation this morning in the Great Hall of the People. He said that the international community's attitude towards the Palestinian issue and the Middle East issue has changed, and the PLO should seize this opportunity to promote this change.

Li Peng expressed that the Chinese people have always supported and will continue to support the Palestinian people's struggle against Israeli aggression and expansion. This principle will not change unless Israel gives up its policy of aggression and expansion. He said that the Palestinian people's struggle has recently achieved significant victories, but this struggle will still be long and arduous because the Palestinian territory is still under Israeli occupation. We hope that the PLO will work on all fronts, utilize the favorable situation, and promote the Palestinian people's struggle to achieve greater victories. He reiterated China's support for the convening of an international conference on the Middle East issue and will work to promote the convening of this conference.

Kaddoumi, on behalf of the PLO, once again thanked China for its consistent support for the Palestinian liberation cause and expressed appreciation for China's stance on the Middle East issue.

　　赵紫阳李鹏分别会见卡杜米    
    指出国际形势对公正合理解决中东问题有利
    本报北京２月１５日讯  记者温宪报道：“只要有利于促进中东公正、持久的和平，中国将一如既往，在力所能及的范围内，我们将继续去做。”这是中共中央总书记赵紫阳今天下午在中南海会见巴勒斯坦解放组织政治部主任卡杜米一行时说的。
    赵紫阳指出，当前国际总的形势出现了缓和与政治解决地区争端的趋向。这对中东问题的公正、合理的解决是一个好的时机。当然，还需要经过复杂的过程。在目前的形势下，要能够把各方的积极因素调动起来，通过各方的努力，促使美国调整政策，使以色列转变立场。巴解组织、阿拉伯国家和世界上一切主持正义的国家应共同努力，来推动中东和平进程。困难还很多，但前途是有希望的。
    卡杜米主任高度评价中国领导人和中国政府决定迅速承认巴勒斯坦国。他说，中国的这一承认对巴勒斯坦人民的斗争在国际上有深远的影响。他还说，我们不会放过同美国对话的良好机会，我们将争取取得明显的结果。卡杜米谴责以色列至今不改变其僵硬立场。
    本报北京２月１５日讯　记者温宪报道：国务院总理李鹏今天上午在人民大会堂会见巴勒斯坦解放组织政治部主任法鲁克·卡杜米一行时说，国际社会对于巴勒斯坦问题和中东问题的态度已经发生了变化，巴解组织应抓紧这个时机，促进这一变化的发展。
    李鹏表示中国人民过去、现在和将来一贯支持巴勒斯坦人民反对以色列侵略扩张的斗争。这个原则立场不会改变，除非以色列放弃侵略扩张政策。他说，巴勒斯坦人民的斗争最近取得了重大的胜利，但是这一斗争仍将是长期和艰苦的，因为巴勒斯坦领土至今还在以色列占领之下。我们希望巴解组织在各条战线上开展工作，利用有利的形势，促使巴勒斯坦人民斗争取得更大胜利。他重申中国支持召开关于中东问题的国际会议，并将努力推动这个会议的召开。
    卡杜米主任代表巴解组织再次感谢中国对巴勒斯坦解放事业的一贯支持，对中国在中东问题上的立场表示赞赏。
