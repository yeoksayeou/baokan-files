The biting north wind did not bring the usual "winter idleness" to Guishi County in Henan Province. Instead, the entire county was bustling with activity: 300,000 laborers were working tirelessly on four major water conservancy projects in the east, west, south, and north. This winter and spring, they aimed to reinforce 58.5 kilometers of the Shiguan River embankment, repair 38 branch canals in two major irrigation areas, and renovate 5,000 ponds and dams. Recently, Henan Province Governor Cheng Weigao visited the area and highly praised the people of the old revolutionary base for their spirit of "preferring hard work to enduring hardship."

Guishi County is one of the poorest counties in the Dabie Mountains. Although significant achievements have been made in water conservancy over the past few decades, the problem of flooding has not been fundamentally solved. Minor disasters occur every year, and major disasters also happen occasionally. Poverty compounded by disasters has made the situation even worse. The county leadership has realized that without addressing the flood problem, poverty cannot be eradicated, and without developing water conservancy, agriculture cannot be stable. They have formulated a five-year plan with the goal of "building high embankments, digging deep ponds, matching canals, dredging internal rivers, and draining internal floods" to promote agriculture through water management.

The first battle was to focus on the treatment of the Shikuo River. This troublesome river flows through six townships. Due to its narrow channel, silted riverbed, numerous and steep bends, it cannot discharge water smoothly, resulting in frequent disasters. When floods come, the two banks become a vast expanse of water, and boats can be seen on land. The treatment project involves cutting off 6 hills, removing 14 large bends, blocking 23 old river mouths, and excavating 11.5 kilometers of new river channels, totaling 3.2 million workdays and requiring an investment of 9.34 million yuan. This project should have been done long ago, but due to various reasons, it has been discussed and delayed for many years. What to do? There are two options: either not do it and face annual disasters, or grit one's teeth and transform nature. "Rather than endure hardship, we should work hard!" The county leadership made their choice. The construction plan was issued. According to the principle of "who benefits, who invests," funds were jointly raised at all levels, and land occupation was coordinated and resolved by townships and villages.

On November 15 last year, four teams marched towards the Shikuo River. Laborers brought grain, straw, cooking utensils, and pickled vegetables, rushing to the construction site. The main roads to the site were bustling with people and vehicles, with tens of thousands of trucks, carts, and bicycles coming and going. The plan was to mobilize 100,000 people, but the actual number reached 180,000.

The laborers lived in makeshift huts, slept on straw mats, and ate pickled vegetables. County-level departments and 20 townships and towns donated 270,000 yuan to support the project. The water conservancy, transportation, health, and other systems and departments organized teams to serve at the construction site. After more than a month of hard work, the new river was excavated, and the long-cherished wish of the people on both banks came true. 215,000 mu of farmland directly or indirectly benefited. Meanwhile, the county's drainage and irrigation projects were also proceeding in an orderly manner, with an investment of 10.3 million yuan and the completion of 5,980 projects. Through water management, cadres saw the power of the masses, the masses saw their own power, and everyone saw the power of self-reliance. Many people deeply felt that good conditions for agricultural production cannot be waited for or relied on; they must be achieved through hard work!

"Rather than talk, we will work hard until we shed our skin," this is the oath and actual action of the Guishi County Party and government leaders leading the people to work hard. They treated the construction site as a battlefield and led the charge. In the treatment of the Shikuo River, four county-level and deputy county-level leaders took command in the front line, 80 township leaders were in charge, 15 main leaders of commissions and bureaus participated in organization, leadership, service, and coordination, and even 22 retired comrades went to the construction site to provide advice as consultants. 20,000 Communist Party members rushed to the construction site to lead the hard work.

Cadres coming to the construction site not only shared the hardships with the laborers but also took the lead in critical moments. The treatment of the Shikuo River often required working in water. It was cold and the water was icy, making it very difficult. A large number of party members and cadres took off their shoes and socks and went into the water first. The exemplary role of the cadres was a silent order, and thousands of soldiers followed.

Currently, in the four major water conservancy project areas of the county, each township and town has a focus, each village has a project, each family has a task, and everyone is taking action. The main county leaders are in charge of each battle zone, leading 300,000 laborers to strive for victory!

　　宁愿苦干不能苦熬
    ——固始县自力更生办水利侧记
    寒冷的北风，没有给河南省固始县吹来往常“冬闲”的气氛，全县一派热气腾腾：３０万民工奋战在东、西、南、北四个水利工地上。这个冬春，他们要加固５８．５公里的史灌河大堤，整修两大灌区的３８条支渠，改造５０００口沟塘堰坝。不久前，河南省省长程维高来到这里，对老区人民“宁肯苦干，不愿苦熬”的精神大为赞扬。
    固始县是大别山区的穷困县之一。几十年水利建设成就虽然不小，但涝灾问题没从根本上解决，小灾年年有，大灾也有发生。穷上加灾，雪上加霜。县领导认准了：水患不除，穷根难拔；水利不兴，农业不稳。他们制定了“高筑堤，深挖塘，渠配套，疏内河，排内涝”十五字治水促农的五年规划。
    头一仗，重点治理石槽河。这条害河流经６个乡，因河道狭窄，河床淤泥，弯多且陡，行洪不畅，大灾小灾年年有。洪水袭来，两岸一片汪洋，陆地行舟。治理工程要切掉６座岗头，裁除１４道大弯，堵塞２３道老河口，开挖１１．５公里新河道，总工日３２０万个，需投资９３４万元。这项工程早该做了，由于种种原因，议了多年，等了多年。怎么办？路有两条：要么不干，年年抗灾年年受灾；要么咬紧牙关，改造自然。“与其苦熬，不如苦干！”县领导作出了选择。施工方案下达了。按照“谁受益谁投资”的原则各级共同筹集资金，占压土地由乡村协调解决。
    去年１１月１５日，四路出兵，挺进石槽河。民工拉着粮、草、炊具，带着咸菜，涌向工地。通往工地的主要道路上，人来车往，数万辆汽车、架子车、自行车络绎不绝，熙熙攘攘，原计划出工１０万人，结果一下子就上了１８万。
    民工们住庵棚，滚草铺，吃咸菜；县直６４个部门和２０个乡、镇的干部职工，慷慨捐款２７万元，支援工程建设。水利、交通、卫生等系统和部门都组织力量，到工地服务。经过一个多月的苦战，新河挖成了，两岸人民梦寐以求的愿望变成了现实。２１．５万亩耕地直接或间接受益。与此同时，全县排涝和灌溉工程也在紧张地进行着，投资１０３０万元，完成各项工程５９８０处。通过治水，干部看到了群众的力量，群众看到了自己的力量，人们共同看到了自力更生的力量。不少人深有体会地说：农业生产的好条件等不来，靠不来，要凭咬紧牙关干出来！
    “宁肯脱层皮，不能耍嘴皮”，这是固始县党政领导带领人民苦干的誓言也是实际行动。他们把施工现场看作战场，冲锋在前。治理石槽河，有４名县级和副县级领导在第一线领兵挂帅，８０名乡镇领导坐阵指挥，１５名委局主要负责人参与组织领导、服务、协调，连２２名退居二线的老同志也到工地出谋献策当顾问，有２万名共产党员奔赴工地领头苦干。
    干部来到工地，不仅与民工同甘共苦，而且在关键时刻身先士卒。治理石槽河常常要带水作业。天冷水寒，难度很大。一大批党员、干部首先脱掉鞋袜下水。干部的模范带头作用是无声的命令，千军万马跟了上来。
    目前，全县四大水利工程区，乡乡镇镇有重点，村村有工程，家家有任务，人人有行动。县主要领导分包各战区，正带领３０万民工奋力拚搏！
