	Nationwide Comfort for Guangxi Border Defense Soldiers

	Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, January 31 (Reporter Zheng Guolian, Correspondent Wang Jinlai) As the Spring Festival approaches, Guangxi border defense soldiers have received over 27,000 letters and tens of thousands of gifts from all over the country.

	Each warm and enthusiastic letter, each exquisite and precious gift, embodies the deep affection of the people of all ethnic groups in the motherland for the border defense soldiers. A Uighur girl from Xinjiang sent the soldiers woolen gloves and handkerchiefs she had carefully knitted herself. The handkerchiefs were embroidered with "Long Live the Soldiers" and a fiery red pomegranate flower. The students and teachers of Chaotian Road Primary School in Guangzhou sent small tape recorders, badminton rackets, and a naval warfare board game. Henan Baofeng Liquor Factory, Guangzhou White Swan Hotel, Chongqing Chemical Factory, and more than 20 outstanding factory directors in Nanning sent gifts to the border defense soldiers, expressing their determination to continue deepening reforms and achieving even better results.

	In recent days, the soldiers and officers of the Guangxi border defense forces have enthusiastically watched the wonderful performances of art and martial arts by the comfort teams from Guangxi, Shandong, and other places.

    连日来，广西边防部队指战员还兴致勃勃地观看了广西、山东等地慰问团的精彩文艺、武术表演。
