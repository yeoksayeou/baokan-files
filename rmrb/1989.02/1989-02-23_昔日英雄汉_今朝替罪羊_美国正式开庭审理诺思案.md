	From Hero to Scapegoat
	The United States Begins Trial of the North Case

	Our reporter Cang Lide reports from Washington, February 21: The long-delayed trial of North finally began here today. North, the central figure in the "Iran-Contra" affair, appeared in court dressed in his Marine Corps olive-green uniform. A heated debate ensued between the prosecutor and the defense attorney.

	The prosecutor accused North of being a "liar," saying he "stood above the law" to cover up the Reagan administration's secret support for the Nicaraguan contra rebels, and that he should not be allowed to use patriotism as an excuse for his lies. North's lead defense attorney, Sullivan, countered that North had always been a loyal and capable officer, carrying out the orders of President Reagan and his senior advisors, only to become a "scapegoat" after the "Iran-Contra" scandal was exposed. Sullivan said that six hours after Attorney General Meese announced the investigation on November 25, 1986, the U.S. President called North, saying, "You are a true American hero, thank you."

	According to lead prosecutor Keck, after Congress passed a law banning U.S. aid to the Nicaraguan contra rebels, the White House National Security Council, including North, began soliciting funds from private individuals and from Taiwan and Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia contributed $32 million.

	Local media estimate that if the trial does not end prematurely due to the defendant presenting "national security" White House secret documents, the proceedings will continue until the summer.

　　昔日英雄汉　今朝替罪羊
    美国正式开庭审理诺思案
    本报华盛顿２月２１日电  记者仓立德报道：几经延误的诺思案今天终于在此地正式开庭审判。“伊朗门”事件的核心人物诺思中校身着海军陆战队橄榄绿军装到庭受审。检察官与辩护人之间展开了一场激烈的辩论。
    检察官指责诺思是“说谎者”，说他“凌驾于法律之上”掩盖里根政府秘密支持尼加拉瓜反政府武装的行动，并说不应允许他披上爱国主义外衣为自己的谎言开脱。诺思的首席辩护律师苏利文则反驳说，诺思一直是一位忠诚、能干的军官，执行了里根总统及其高级顾问的命令，只是在“伊朗门”事件的丑闻暴露后才成了被抛弃的“替罪羊”。苏利文说，在１９８６年１１月２５日司法部长米斯宣布调查此事之后６小时，美国总统给诺思打电话，说“你是一位真正的美国英雄，谢谢你。”
    据首席检察官凯克说，在国会通过一项法律禁止美国援助尼加拉瓜反政府武装后，白宫国家安全委员会，包括诺思在内，便向一些私人及台湾、沙特阿拉伯要钱。沙特阿拉伯为此付出３２００万美元。
    此间舆论界估计，如果此案不会因被告出示“危害国家安全”的白宫秘密文件而中途夭折的话，审判将一直延续到夏季。
