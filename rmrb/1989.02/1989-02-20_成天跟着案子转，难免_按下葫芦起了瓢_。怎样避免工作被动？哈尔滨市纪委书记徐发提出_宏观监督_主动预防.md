Being constantly busy with cases often leads to the situation where "pressing down the gourd makes the bottle pop up." How can one avoid being passive in work? Xu Fa, the Secretary of the Discipline Inspection Commission of Harbin City, proposes: Macroscopic Supervision and Proactive Prevention.

Reporter: Some people say that the Discipline Inspection Commission is responsible for investigating cases, and the more cases they investigate, the greater their achievements. What is your view on this?

Xu Fa: Investigating cases of party discipline violations is an essential part of the work of the Discipline Inspection Commission; however, investigating cases is not the goal but a means, with the ultimate aim of rectifying party conduct and safeguarding the reform and opening up. If one merely investigates cases for the sake of investigating, it often results in doubled efforts and halved results. In my opinion, evaluating the performance of discipline inspection work in a place should not be based solely on the number of cases investigated but should analyze how well party conduct is being built.

Reporter: How can discipline inspection work shift from being passive to proactive?

Xu Fa: First, one must overcome the "blind, deaf, and mute" state, and not turn a blind eye or deaf ear to major and widespread violations of party discipline within the party, especially having a macroscopic and clear understanding of the overall situation of party conduct building. One must be good at identifying problems and trends. Otherwise, working in the dark or with unclear vision, waiting for cases to be reported before investigating, is too passive. People will point at our backs and say, "You only catch the 'unlucky' ones." Those who are investigated will not be convinced, and those who are not investigated will still have a sense of luck, even becoming more brazen and escalating their actions.

Reporter: It is not easy to have a macroscopic understanding and analysis of the overall situation of party conduct. What are the strategies used by the Discipline Inspection Commission of Harbin City?

Xu Fa: There is an old saying, "Moon halo means wind, and wet foundation means rain." To timely grasp the trends in party conduct and discipline building, we have strengthened three information channels: First, we seriously handle every letter from the masses and receive every visitor, insisting on conducting a comprehensive analysis of the situation every quarter. Second, we have established a team of 98 party conduct information officers in various districts and streets under the city, who directly report the true situation of party conduct and discipline to the municipal Discipline Inspection Commission. Third, the staff of the municipal Discipline Inspection Commission have established contact points for party conduct and discipline building with more than 60 units. In October last year, the standing committee of the municipal Discipline Inspection Commission also established a contact system with more than 30 enterprise discipline inspection commissions. Through these channels, we have timely grasped the new situations and problems in party conduct and discipline.

Reporter: After understanding and grasping the situation, what steps do you take?

Xu Fa: After analysis and research, we focus on the initial signs and trends of disciplinary issues and give early warnings and alarms. For example, during the initial phase of organizational reform in our city, some departments and units took advantage of the reform to hastily promote officials, squander public funds, give gifts, and distribute bonuses and goods. The original Second Light Industry Bureau promoted more than 30 deputy and section-level officials before the merger, causing a bad impression among the people. In response to these problems, the municipal Discipline Inspection Commission issued a "Notice on Strictly Adhering to Party Discipline During Organizational Reform," proposing six requirements to party members and cadres, such as adhering to organizational and financial discipline, maintaining integrity, and setting an example. This had a good effect. During this organizational reform and cadre exchange, six bureau-level units in the municipal government were dissolved, and more than 500 cadres were sent to work at the grassroots level. Due to the timely adoption of preventive measures, no disciplinary issues arose.

Reporter: What if disciplinary issues do arise?

Xu Fa: There is no question about it; if there is a case to investigate, it must be investigated, and if there is a case to handle, it must be handled. Over the past five years, our city has investigated 4,650 cases of party member disciplinary violations, and only 48 bureau-level party cadres have been dealt with. However, we also have a thought: After a certain case is closed, the unit where the case occurred will definitely be shaken, but similar problems may still occur in other units. For example, after the case of Zhang Deren, an examiner from the Traffic Department of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, who used his position to accept bribes totaling more than 30,000 yuan, was exposed, the municipal Discipline Inspection Commission helped the Municipal Public Security Bureau formulate the "Harbin City Motor Vehicle Driver Training and Examination System" and published it in the newspapers for public supervision. Since then, there have been no reports of "examiners" openly extorting money in our city, and the trend of drivers spending high prices to obtain driver's licenses has significantly subsided.

Reporter: In preventing and controlling the occurrence of disciplinary issues, you have focused on improving the system and public supervision. What is the significance of this?

Xu Fa: We are the ruling party. Relying solely on self-supervision and acting on party principles is not enough; we also need to rely on systems, the public, and public opinion. Some people are not afraid of internal party penalties but are afraid of being exposed and seeing their names in the newspapers. This shows the problem. Last year, the relocation of 154 enterprises and 6,000 households on the "Northern Ring Road" in our city was made public before the relocation. Due to the high transparency of the policy, the relocation was completed in just 14 days, with no one appealing or making complaints.

From another perspective, why do party disciplinary issues persist? One important reason is that some systems are not open enough.

    成天跟着案子转，难免“按下葫芦起了瓢”。怎样避免工作被动？哈尔滨市纪委书记徐发提出——
    宏观监督　主动预防
    本报记者　陈维伟
    记者：有人说，纪委就是查案子的，查得越多，成绩就越大。您怎么看？
    徐发：查处党内违纪案件，是纪委工作的题中之义；但查案本身不是目的，而是手段，最终目的是端正党风，为改革开放保驾护航。若是单纯地为查案而查案，往往会事倍功半。我看，衡量一个地方纪检工作的成绩究竟如何，不能单纯统计案子查了多少，要分析那里的党风建设抓得怎么样。
    记者：纪检工作怎样才能变被动为主动？
    徐发：首先要克服“盲、聋、哑”状态，对党内重大而普遍的违纪现象不能看不见、听不到、说不出，特别是对党风建设的全局有个宏观的、清醒的认识，善于发现带有倾向性的问题和苗头。否则，两眼一摸黑，或若明若暗，等案子报上来再去查，就太被动了，人们会指着我们的脊梁骨说：“你们就会抓‘倒霉’的。”被查到的人不服气，查不到的人还会产生侥幸心理，甚至肆无忌惮，变本加厉。
    记者：对党风状况全局进行宏观了解和分析，并不容易，你们哈尔滨市纪委有何高招呢？
    徐发：有句老话叫做“月晕而风，础润而雨。”为及时掌握党风党纪建设发展的动向，我们强化了三条信息渠道：一是认真处理每一封群众来信，认真接待每一位来访者，坚持每季度进行一次信访情况的综合分析；二是在市属各区、街道建立了９８人的党风信息员队伍，直接向市纪委反映党风党纪真实情况；三是市纪委机关干部与６０多个单位建立了党风党纪建设联系点，去年１０月，市纪委常委又与３０多个企业纪委建立了联系制度。通过以上渠道，我们及时掌握了党风党纪出现的新情况、新问题。
    记者：了解掌握情况以后，你们又采取哪些步骤？
    徐发：经过分析、研究，抓住违纪问题的苗头和倾向，及早打招呼、敲警钟。比如，在我市机构改革初期，有的部门和单位借机构改革之机突击提干，挥霍公款，请客送礼，乱发奖金实物。原市二轻局在机构合并前，一次就突击提拔处科级干部３０多名，在群众中造成不良影响。针对这些问题，市纪委发出了《关于在机构改革中严守党的纪律的通知》，向党员干部提出了严守组织纪律、财经纪律，保持清正廉洁，发挥表率作用等６条要求，收到良好效果。在这次机构改革和干部交流中，市直机关先后有６个局级单位撤销，５００多名干部充实到基层工作，由于及时采取了预防措施，没有出现违纪问题。
    记者：如果真的出现了违纪问题，你们怎么办？
    徐发：没的说，该查一定要查，该处理一定要处理。５年来，我市共查处党员违纪案件４６５０起，仅处理局级党员干部就有４８人。但我们还有一个想法：某一案件结案后，发案单位肯定会有震动，但同类问题在其它单位还有可能发生。比如，市公安局交通处考试员张德仁利用职务之便，收受贿赂３万多元的案件暴露出来后，市纪委帮助市公安局制定了《哈尔滨市机动车驾驶员培训考试制度》，并公之于报端，让全市人民监督？此后，在我市尚未发现在办证中“考官”公开勒卡的问题，司机花高价考驾驶证的歪风有明显收敛。
    记者：在防止和控制违纪问题发生方面，你们抓了制度完善和群众监督，它的意义在哪里？
    徐发：我们是执政党，只靠自身监督、凭党性办事，是不够的，还要靠制度、靠群众、靠社会舆论。有人不怕党内处分，却怕公开，怕见报，这就说明了问题。去年，我市“北环路”１５４家企业和６０００户居民的房屋搬迁，事前把动迁的政策、纪律公开。由于政策透明度高，仅用１４天就全部动迁完毕，无一人上访告状。
    换一个角度讲，为什么党内违纪现象屡禁不止？其中，某些制度不够公开是个重要原因。
