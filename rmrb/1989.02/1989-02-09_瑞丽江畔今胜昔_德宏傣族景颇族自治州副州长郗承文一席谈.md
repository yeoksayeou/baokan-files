The Ruili River Today is Better Than Ever Before
— A Conversation with Deputy Governor Xi Chengwen of Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture

*Enterprise* reporter Méi Xuān'ān, *People's Daily* reporter Dǒng Huànliàng

We have long heard of the beautiful scenery and abundant resources of Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, and its economic development ranking at the forefront among ethnic minority regions in the country. In the midst of a snowy winter, we set out from the northern snow-covered lands, traveled thousands of miles, and arrived in the sunny, flower-filled Dehong region.

Dehong Prefecture is located in the western part of Yunnan, administratively divided into five counties and one city, with a population of 840,000, of which more than half are ethnic minorities. The northwestern, western, and southern borders all adjoin Myanmar, and the economic and cultural exchanges between the two countries' border residents are very close. Therefore, the political stability and economic development of Dehong Prefecture are of great significance to the consolidation of the country's southwestern border.

At the Mangshi Hotel, where Premier Zhou Enlai once stayed, we interviewed Deputy Governor Xi Chengwen, who is over fifty years old. He is tall and has the distinct facial features of a Dai person. Although his temples are frosted with gray, he is full of energy and speaks steadily. The interview began with the agriculture that dominates Dehong Prefecture.

"Dehong is a remote area with high mountains and dangerous roads, making it inconvenient to interact with the interior. At any time, we cannot lack food, so we must focus on and improve grain production," Xi Chengwen said frankly. The grain production in Dehong Prefecture has rapidly developed since 1978. From 1964 to 1977, over 14 years, grain production remained around 200 million kilograms. In 1978, the stagnation was broken, reaching 275 million kilograms. In 1988, the prefecture's grain production exceeded 375 million kilograms, two years ahead of the "Seventh Five-Year Plan" target for 1990, ranking first in Yunnan Province. More importantly, the grain commercialization rate reached 40%, making Dehong the prefecture with the highest grain output in Yunnan.

When discussing the reasons for the continuous increase in grain production, Xi Chengwen said, "This is mainly due to the stable policies of successive governments to promote grain production. Although there was a period when 'selling grain was difficult,' our preferential policies of subsidizing farmers with seeds, pesticides, and fertilizers have remained unchanged. In addition, we have invested a lot of effort in promoting agricultural technological progress. The prefecture has established 55 agricultural technology promotion stations, one in each township, vigorously promoting hybrid rice and hybrid corn. By 1988, the area of hybrid rice had reached 510,000 mu, accounting for 90% of the suitable planting area, achieving significant increases in production."

With a guarantee of grain production, Dehong Prefecture has also taken advantage of its location in the subtropical zone to vigorously develop sugarcane production. Before the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, Dehong Prefecture had only scattered sugarcane fields, and sugarcane production was not significant. In the past ten years, the area of sugarcane planting has increased by 14.13% each year; sugarcane production has increased by 22.06% each year; and sugar production has increased by 25.21% each year. In 1988, 140,000 tons of sugar were produced, exceeding the total production of Sichuan Province, ranking first in Yunnan Province. Currently, sugar has become the second-largest commodity in Dehong Prefecture after grain.

Comrade Xi Chengwen told the reporter, "The rapid development of sugar production has brought about profound changes in Dehong's economic structure, driving the development of the food machinery industry, machinery repair industry, and transportation industry. Now, the prefecture has gradually formed an industrial system centered on the sugar industry. This has increased fiscal revenue and raised farmers' incomes. In 1987, sugar production generated 12.653 million yuan in taxes and profits, accounting for 19.3% of the prefecture's annual fiscal revenue."

In the past decade of reform, Dehong Prefecture has not only seen a new look in industrial and agricultural production, but more importantly, commerce and trade have flourished, and the commodity economy awareness of ethnic minorities has significantly strengthened. Previously, the Dai people mainly raised fish for their own consumption, but now they dig fish ponds, introduce high-quality breeds, and mainly for sale. In the winter, Dehong's watermelons cross the Yangtze River, the Yellow River, and the Great Wall, appearing in the icy and snowy Northeast. The commodity rate in rural areas has risen from 25.6% before the reform to the current 56%. The flourishing commerce and trade have brought about a large flow of people and goods throughout the prefecture, especially in 1988, when this trend developed rapidly. According to incomplete statistics from the transportation supervision department, from January to November 1988, the number of various vehicles entering and exiting Dehong Prefecture reached 550,000, 6.7 times that of the same period in 1987; the number of people entering and exiting was 3.16 million, 6.3 times that of the same period in 1987. In the small town of Ruili County, the non-agricultural population is only 11,000, but the daily floating population exceeds 15,000.

The development of the commodity economy has brought about changes in ideological and cultural concepts, and has also had an impact on traditional ethnic customs. Xi Chengwen shared an interesting story with us: "In the past, due to economic backwardness, Dai young men often wore cotton blankets on the street, bringing their beloved young women, and when they were passionate, they would stand on the street and wrap the young women in the blanket to be close. But now, when Dai young men and women go out, they all wear fashionable clothes, dressed neatly, and you can no longer see the past phenomena." The reporter's gaze swept over the Dai bamboo houses and saw the young women of Mangshi Street, with light or heavy makeup, looking more charming and enchanting under the bright skirts. The young men wore suits and ties, looking particularly elegant and handsome.

On the banks of the Ruili River, people of all ethnic groups are steadily striding towards a more beautiful future. As we parted, Deputy Governor Xi jokingly said, "Wait until the Dehong Airport is completed next year, and you won't have to travel through mountains and rivers next time. The journey of thousands of miles will be just 'a flick of the wrist'!"

　　瑞丽江畔今胜昔
　　——德宏傣族景颇族自治州副州长郗承文一席谈
    《企业家》记者　梅训安　本报记者　董焕亮
    久闻德宏傣族景颇族自治州风光旖旎，物产丰富，经济发展在全国少数民族聚居地区中名列前茅。时值隆冬，我们从瑞雪纷飞的北国出发，万里跋涉，来到风和日丽、繁花似锦的德宏大地。
    德宏州地处云南西部，下辖五县一市，人口８４万，其中少数民族占一半以上。西北、西部与南部均与缅甸接壤，两国边民经济文化交流十分密切。因此，德宏州的政治稳定和经济发展对巩固祖国西南边疆有着十分重要的意义。
    在周恩来总理下榻过的芒市宾馆，记者采访了年过半百的郗承文副州长。他身材颀长，傣族人的容貌特征十分明显。虽然鬓发染霜，却精力旺盛，谈吐稳健。采访从德宏州占主导地位的农业开始。
    “德宏地处偏远，山高路险，与内地交往不便，任何时候都不能缺粮，必须把粮食生产抓紧，抓好。”郗承文开宗明义地说。德宏州的粮食生产是１９７８年以后迅速发展起来的。从１９６４年到１９７７年的１４年间，粮食产量始终徘徊在２亿公斤左右。１９７８年突破徘徊局面，达到２．７５亿公斤。１９８８年，全州粮食生产突破了３．７５亿公斤，提前两年达到了“七五”计划规定的１９９０年的指标，居云南全省之首。更可喜的是，粮食商品率达到４０％，成为云南省调出粮食最多的州。
    谈到粮食连年增产的原因时，郗承文说：“这主要靠历届政府促进粮食增产的政策稳定，尽管一度也出现过‘卖粮难’，但我们对粮农实行良种、农药、化肥补贴的优惠政策始终没变。除此以外，我们还在促进农业科技进步方面花了很大气力。全州设立农技推广站５５个，乡乡都有，大力推广杂交水稻和杂交玉米。到１９８８年，杂交稻面积已达５１万亩，占适种面积的９０％，实现了大幅度增产。”
    在粮食生产有保证的基础上，德宏州还因地制宜，发挥地处亚热带的优势，大力发展甘蔗生产。党的十一届三中全会以前，德宏州只有零星蔗田，蔗糖生产不成气候。近十年，全州甘蔗种植面积每年递增１４．１３％；甘蔗产量每年递增２２．０６％；糖产量每年递增２５．２１％。１９８８年生产蔗糖１４万吨，超过了四川全省的产量，居云南省第一位。目前，蔗糖已成为德宏州仅次于粮食的第二大商品。
    郗承文同志告诉记者：“蔗糖生产的飞跃发展使德宏州经济结构发生了深刻的变化，带动了食品机械工业、机械修理业、交通运输业的发展。现在，全州已逐步形成了一个以制糖业为主的工业体系。这就使财政收入增加了，农民收入提高了。１９８７年蔗糖生产获税利１２６５．３万元，占全州年财政收入的１９．３％。”
    改革十年来，德宏州不仅在工农业生产上面貌一新，更令人欣喜的是商业贸易空前繁荣，少数民族群众的商品经济观念也大大加强了。以前傣族人养鱼主要是自己吃，而现在挖鱼池，引进良种，主要为了卖。隆冬，德宏州的西瓜跨长江，过黄河，越长城，出现在冰天雪地的东北。农村商品率由改革前的２５．６％跃升到现在的５６％。繁荣的商业贸易，带来了全州人财物的大流动，尤其是在１９８８年，这种流动的势头发展迅猛。据交通监理部门的不完全统计，１９８８年１月—１１月，出入德宏州的各种车辆就达５５万辆之多，是１９８７年同期的６．７倍；人员进出３１６万，是１９８７年同期的６．３倍。弹丸之地的瑞丽县城，非农业人口只有１．１万人，而每天流动人口却超过１．５万人。
    商品经济的发展带来了思想文化观念上的变化，对传统的民族习俗也产生了冲击。郗承文给我们讲了一段趣话：“过去由于经济落后，傣族卜帽（小伙子）常披着棉毯上街，带着心爱的卜少（姑娘），情热时就站在街头用棉毯裹住卜少亲近。而现在的卜帽、卜少上街，都身着时髦的服装，衣冠楚楚，再也看不见过去那种现象了。”记者的视线掠过傣族竹楼，看到芒市街头，卜少们淡妆浓抹，在艳丽的筒裙的衬映下，显得更加娇妍迷人。卜帽们西装革履，格外潇洒倜傥。
    瑞丽江畔，各族人民正步履稳健地走向更加美好的未来。临别时，郗副州长握着我们的手诙谐地说：“待明年德宏飞机场修好后，你们再来就用不着跋山涉水了，万里征途不过‘弹指一挥间’哟！”
