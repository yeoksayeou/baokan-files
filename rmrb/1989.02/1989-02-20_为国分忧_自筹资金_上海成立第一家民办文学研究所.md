	For the Nation's Concerns, Independently Raising Funds
	Shanghai Establishes the First Private Literary Research Institute

	Some individuals in the arts community believe that under the state's macro-control, not only can science and technology industries be privately run, but cultural industries can also be privately run.

	Reported by our newspaper: The first private research institute in the social sciences in the country—Shanghai Popular Literature Research Institute—has recently been approved and officially inaugurated.

	Over the past decade of reform, numerous private research institutions in the field of natural sciences have emerged, full of vitality. However, in the field of social sciences, including literature, private research institutions are few and far between. The Shanghai Popular Literature Research Institute, initiated by a group of professors, writers, and journalists, has emerged in response to this need.

	Chen Bixiang, an associate professor at Shanghai Education Institute, serves as the director of this research institute. He said: Based on our analysis of the current macro-environment and our assessment of our own capabilities, we dare to undertake this experiment with a certain degree of risk. In the absence of any existing models to draw upon, we are not afraid of the various difficulties and potential setbacks and failures we may encounter. With a sincere desire to contribute to the nation's concerns and to explore paths for reform, we have independently raised funds to establish this research institute.

	Why focus on popular literature as the main research topic? Their reasoning is: Although pure literature has an irreplaceable function and contribution, its limitations in terms of popularization are well-known. In contrast, popular literature, with its vast coverage, will play an indispensable role in the arduous task of creating spiritual civilization. They believe that distinguishing the essence from the dross in popular literature and taking corresponding measures, providing commentary and guidance on the creation of popular literature, and addressing these issues that need to be solved, are areas where some formal literary research institutions have not had the time or resources to focus on. Therefore, they want to make their mark in this promising field.

	Since purely academic research institutions cannot solve funding issues and lack the means to promote their research findings to society, this collective enterprise unit is also a commercial entity, using research to drive business and business to support research. The director of the research institute has the status of a legal representative.

	It is reported that the work of the research institute has been fully launched. It has established departments such as the Chinese Popular Literature Research Office, Foreign Popular Literature Research Office, Hong Kong and Taiwan Popular Literature Research Office, as well as the Film and Television Department and the Business Department. It has organized a group of theorists to systematically study popular literature from basic theory to creative practice, and is compiling a series of books on popular literature research, including "A History of Chinese Popular Literature," "An Introduction to Popular Literature," and "An Overview of World Popular Literature."

	The establishment of the research institute has received the enthusiastic attention and support of many in the literary community. Some senior figures have fully endorsed it, saying: Where does China's reform lead? To privatization. Under the state's macro-control, not only can science and technology industries be privately run, but cultural industries can also be privately run. All industries can be privately run.

	This research institute is currently affiliated with the Shanghai branch of the Chinese Writers Association.

### 为国分忧　自筹资金  上海成立第一家民办文学研究所

　　为国分忧　自筹资金
    上海成立第一家民办文学研究所
    一些文艺界人士认为，在国家宏观调控下搞民办，不但科技实业可以民办，文化实业也可以民办。
    本报讯　全国第一家社会科学方面的民办研究所——上海通俗文学研究所最近获准正式挂牌宣告成立。
    改革十年来，属于自然科学范畴的各种民办科研机构大量涌现，生气勃勃，而包括文学在内的社会科学领域，民办的科研机构则寥若晨星。由一批教授、作家、记者发起成立的上海通俗文学研究所应运而生。
    上海教育学院副教授陈必祥出任这家研究所所长。他说：基于对当前宏观环境的分析和对自身条件的估量，我们才敢于从事这一带有一定风险的尝试，在一时尚无现成范例可资借鉴的情况下，不怕将会遇到的种种困难和可能遭受的挫折失败，怀着为国分忧、为改革探路的热切愿望，自筹资金，创办这个研究所。
    为何把通俗文学定为研究所的主攻课题？他们的理由是：虽然纯文学有着不可低估的功能与贡献，但它的普及所受到的局限也已是众所周知的；相反，通俗文学以其极大的涵盖面在创造精神文明的艰巨事业中，将产生不容忽视的作用。他们认为，如何分辨通俗文学中的精华与糟粕并采取相应对策，对通俗文学的创作进行评论和引导，对于这些有待解决的问题，一些正规的文学研究机构尚无暇更多地顾及，所以他们想在这大有可为的领域内施展身手。
    由于单纯从事学术研究的民办机构无法解决经费问题，更无力通过必要的方式将研究成果推向社会，所以这家集体事业单位同时也是经营性实体，以研究带动经营，经营支撑研究。研究所所长具有法人代表资格。
    据悉，研究所的工作已全面铺开。下设中国通俗文学、外国通俗文学、港台通俗文学研究室及影视部、经营部等，组织了一批理论工作者对通俗文学从基础理论到创作实践进行系统研究，并编纂包括《中国通俗文学史》、《通俗文学概论》、《世界通俗文学概况》在内的通俗文学研究系列丛书。
    研究所的成立得到了文学界许多人士的热情关注和支持，一些老资格的同志对此充分肯定，他们说：中国改革的出路在哪里？在民办。在国家宏观调控下搞民办，不但科技实业可以民办，文化实业同样可以民办，一切的事业都可以民办。
　　这家研究所现挂靠中国作协上海分会。　　　（周导）
