A carpet cleaner made primarily from natural leguminous plants, known as the Xinyu brand, has been introduced as the first of its kind in both domestic and international markets. It has won the bronze medal at the 37th "Eureka" World Invention Expo in 1988. The launch of this product has ended the situation where China relied entirely on imports for carpet cleaners, and has also opened up new avenues for the comprehensive utilization of abundant wild plants in the country.

This carpet cleaner was jointly developed by the Yuhua Chemical Factory in Xinle County, Hebei Province, and Tianjin Normal University.

    一种以天然豆科植物为主要原料的地毯清洗剂问世
    以天然豆科植物为主要原料的鲜虞牌地毯清洗剂，作为国内外首创产品，获得一九八八年第三十七届“尤里卡”世界发明铜牌奖。这一产品的问世，改变了我国地毯清洗剂全部依靠进口的局面，也为国内丰富的野生植物综合利用开辟了新的途径。
    这种地毯清洗剂是河北省新乐县裕华化学厂与天津师范大学共同研制成功的。
