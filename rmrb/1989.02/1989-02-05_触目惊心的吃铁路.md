Title: Shocking Railroad Theft

Theft and vandalism along the railways have become rampant, posing a serious threat to state property and the safety of railway transportation. Some criminals, dubbed the "modern railway guerrillas," are adept at boarding moving freight cars to brazenly steal transported goods. Even some young rural women can be seen wielding tools, boarding and alighting from moving trains to steal cargo.

These evil "railway guerrillas" are spreading along various railway lines. In Changsha Village, Xunyang County, Shaanxi Province, with only 17 households, almost every family is involved in "eating the railway." Since 1987, they have stolen 109 types of railway equipment, materials, and transported goods, valued at over 80,000 yuan.

In some marshalling yards and freight yards, it is common to see groups of men and women, carrying woven bags, lurking around the tracks, pretending to pick up scraps to cover their theft of transported goods and railway materials. More thieves are no longer satisfied with "small-time" and "solo" operations; their appetites are growing, and new theft characteristics include "four modernizations": high-end stolen items, mechanized tools, organized theft groups, and intelligence-based operations.

"Eating the railway" has developed into a "three-dimensional" style, taking whatever the railway has, leading to severe damage and erosion of railway operating equipment.

Some local farmers have taken large amounts of gravel from under the railway tracks to build roads, a practice surprisingly endorsed by some local officials. The theory of "local protectionism" is: rely on the railway, eat the railway. Some even consider this "able-bodied enrichment." They turn a blind eye to the theft and looting of railway materials, even condoning and encouraging such behavior. When cases are discovered, the railway authorities face difficulties in handling them, and the criminals go unpunished, emboldening them to escalate their crimes.

### 触目惊心的吃铁路

　　触目惊心的吃铁路
    如今铁路沿线的盗窃破坏活动十分猖獗，严重威胁着国家财产和铁路运输的安全。一些被称为“现代铁道游击队”的犯罪分子，能够熟练地扒上运行中的货车，放肆地偷盗运输物资。甚至有些年轻的农村姑娘，也能手持器械，在列车运行中扒上跳下，盗窃货物。
    这些罪恶的“铁道游击队”，正在各铁路沿线扩展蔓延。陕西省旬阳县长沙村只有１７户人家，几乎家家都“吃铁路”。１９８７年以来，他们先后盗窃铁路设备器材和运输物资１０９种，价值８万余元。
    在一些编组站和货场，经常可见三五成群的男女，身背编织袋，出没股道间，以拣破烂作掩护，盗窃运输物资和铁路器材。更多的盗窃者已不满足“小打小闹”和“单干”了，胃口越来越大，新的行盗特点有“四化”：偷盗物品高档化，作案工具机械化，偷盗人员团体化，行动情报化。
    “吃铁路”已发展到车上车下“立体式”，铁路有啥就拿啥，这些行为致使铁路行车设备受到蚕食和严重破坏。
    有的铁路钢轨下的道碴被当地农民大量扒走修公路，这种做法竟受到地方部门一些人的认可。“地方保护主义”的理论是：靠铁路，就得吃铁路。有的还认为，这是“能人致富”。对盗窃、哄抢铁路物资的行为放任不管，甚至姑息养奸。案发后，铁路部门查处困难，犯罪分子得不到及时有力的打击，使违法者有恃无恐，变本加厉。
