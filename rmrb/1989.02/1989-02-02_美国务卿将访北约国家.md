The U.S. State Department announced on January 31 that Secretary of State Baker plans to make a shuttle visit to the European allies of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in mid-February.

State Department spokesman Redman said Baker plans to meet with the foreign ministers of 14 countries during his week-long visit and will meet with NATO Secretary-General Werner in Brussels. Redman said Baker attaches great importance to getting to know his NATO colleagues.

Redman said Baker's working visit will take place sometime between Bush's trip to Canada on February 10 and his trip to Asia on February 24.

Newly elected President Bush told reporters after his election victory that he would first send the Secretary of State to discuss disarmament and U.S.-Soviet relations with the allies, and then consider holding a summit meeting with Soviet leader Gorbachev.
