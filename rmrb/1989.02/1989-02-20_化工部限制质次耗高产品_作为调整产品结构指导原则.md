The Ministry of Chemical Industry recently proposed a list of chemical products to be restricted in production. Among the 12 categories of products to be restricted, the first category is small calcium carbide with an electricity consumption of more than 3,800 degrees per ton. Restricting low-quality, high-consumption products will serve as a guiding principle for adjusting the product structure within China's chemical industry.

Given the current severe shortage of many raw materials, the Ministry of Chemical Industry has also restricted the production of some small oxalic acid and small titanium dioxide. This includes: small titanium dioxide plants that consume more than 3 tons of titanium ore and 4.5 tons of sulfuric acid per ton of titanium dioxide produced; small oxalic acid plants that consume more than 1,250 kilograms of caustic soda, 1,150 kilograms of sulfuric acid, and 620 kilograms of nitric acid per ton of oxalic acid, with an annual production capacity of less than 1,000 tons.

The Ministry of Chemical Industry stipulates that products without quality assurance cannot be produced. For example, small paint factories that lack testing conditions, do not meet standards, and have an annual production capacity of less than 500 tons; non-designated off-brand, low-quality, high-consumption bias tires; rubber products produced by traditional methods such as triangular belts, fan belts, O-rings, and other rubber products; rubber products produced by township enterprises that lack normal production conditions and monitoring capabilities, etc. Environmental protection is also given due attention. This list includes small dye factories in rural areas that have not treated "three wastes" and produce duplicate products.

In this adjustment of product structure, the Ministry of Chemical Industry has also fully considered market demand. It restricts the production of products with limited market potential that also compete for raw materials, ensuring effective supply. This part of the restricted products includes: general plastic products; audio and video tapes, floppy disks, black-and-white film, and black-and-white photographic paper; general chemical reagents; non-branded bicycle tires, etc.

　　化工部限制质次耗高产品    
    作为调整产品结构指导原则
    新华社北京２月１８日电  （记者赵明亮）化工部最近提出了当前应限制生产的化工产品目录。在将受到限制的１２类产品中，第一类即每吨电耗高于３８００度的小电石。限制质次耗高的产品将作为我国化工系统进行产品结构调整的指导原则。
    鉴于目前许多原材料严重供应不足，化工部还把一些小草酸和小钛白粉的生产加以限制。其中包括：每生产１吨钛白粉消耗钛矿和硫酸分别高于３吨和４．５吨的小钛白粉厂；每吨草酸消耗烧碱、硫酸、硝酸分别高于１２５０公斤、１１５０公斤和６２０公斤，年生产能力低于１０００吨的小草酸厂。
    化工部规定：缺乏质量保证的产品不能生产。如检测条件不具备、质量达不到标准，年生产能力低于５００吨的小油漆；国家定点外的质次耗高的斜交轮胎；土法生产的三角带、风扇带、Ｏ型密封圈和其他橡胶制品；不具备正常生产条件和监测手段的乡镇企业生产的橡胶制品等。环境保护也得到应有重视，这一目录中列入了“三废”没治理、产品重复的乡村办的小染料。
    化工部这次调整产品结构，还充分考虑了市场需求情况，限制一些市场潜力不大、同时又在争原料的产品生产，以保证有效供给。这部分被限制的产品包括：一般塑料制品；录音、录相磁带、软磁盘、黑白胶卷和黑白相纸；通用化学试剂；非名牌自行车配套的车胎等。
