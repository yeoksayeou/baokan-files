West Berlin City Council Election Results Announced, Far-Right Republican Party Enters Parliament

	West Berlin, January 30 (Xinhua) — According to the official results of the West Berlin city council elections published on January 30, the ruling parties, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the Free Democratic Party (FDP), suffered a heavy defeat. The main opposition party, the Social Democratic Party (SPD), saw a slight increase in votes, while the Greens also saw a modest increase. The far-right Republican Party, participating for the first time, unexpectedly entered the parliament.

	According to statistics, the CDU received 37.8% of the votes and 55 seats, a decrease of 14 seats from the previous parliament. The FDP received only 3.9% of the votes, failing to reach the 5% threshold required to enter the parliament, and losing all 12 of its seats. The SPD received 37.3% of the votes and 55 seats, an increase of 7 seats from the previous parliament. The Greens received 11.8% of the votes and 17 seats, an increase of 1.2% and 2 seats respectively. The Republican Party received 7.5% of the votes and will have 7 seats in the parliament.

	This election result surprised both West Berlin and the various parties in the Federal Republic of Germany. Since no party has an absolute majority, forming a new city government will be fraught with difficulties.

	Approximately 10,000 people from various sectors of West Berlin took to the streets on January 29 and 30 to protest against the entry of the Republican Party into the parliament. They chanted slogans such as "Nazis out, foreigners stay."

	According to local analysts, the votes received by the Republican Party mostly came from voters who were dissatisfied with the CDU. During the CDU and FDP's rule, policies to reduce social welfare, high unemployment, a large influx of immigrants, the extension of military service, and various scandals involving government officials had a negative impact on the ruling parties.

　　西柏林市议会选举已揭晓
    极右组织共和党进入议会
    新华社波恩１月３０日电  （记者翁振葆）西柏林消息：据西柏林官方１月３０日公布的西柏林市议会选举结果，执政党基民盟和自由党遭到惨败；第一大反对党社民党得票有所回升，绿党得票也略有增加；第一次参加竞选的“极右”组织共和党一举进入议会，出乎各界预料。
    据统计，基民盟得票３７．８％，议席５５，比上届议会减少１４席；自民党得票仅占３．９％，未达到进入议会所必须的５％限额，失掉了它迄今所有的１２个议席；社民党得票３７．３％，议席５５，比上届增加７席；绿党得票１１．８％，议席１７，比上届分别增加１．２％和２％；共和党得票７．５％，可在议会获得７个议席。
    这一选举结果使西柏林和联邦德国各政党均感意外。由于各党都没有绝对多数，组建新市政府将困难重重。
    西柏林各界约１万人２９日和３０日分别上街游行，对共和党人进入议会表示反对，他们高呼“纳粹滚出去，外国人留下来”。
    据此间人士分析，共和党所得的选票大多数来自于对基民盟不满的选民。基民盟和自由党执政期间推行削减社会福利的政策措施，在失业率居高不下的情况下大量移民涌入，延长士兵服役期以及政府官员的种种丑闻产生不利于执政党的影响。
