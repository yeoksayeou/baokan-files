Japan has completed the final hull design for a superconducting electromagnetic propulsion ship and will begin construction of the ship in April.

The superconducting ship, named "Yamato No. 1," was initiated by the Japan Shipbuilding Industry Association in June 1985. The designed ship is approximately 26 meters long, 10 meters wide, and weighs 250 tons. The hull is streamlined, with two electromagnetic propulsion devices installed on either side. The superconducting ship can reach a maximum speed of eight nautical miles. Compared to ships propelled by propellers, it has less vibration, lower noise, higher efficiency, and faster speed, and can accommodate ten people.

　　日本完成超导船船体设计
    新华社东京一月三十日电  日本已完成超导电磁推进船的最后船体设计，将于四月开始建造这条超导船。
    这条名为“大和一号”的超导船，是日本造船振兴财团于一九八五年六月着手研制的。设计中的船体长约二十六米，宽约十米，重二百五十吨，船体呈流线型，船体左右装有两个电磁推进装置。超导船的最高速度可达八海里，与螺旋桨推动式船相比，震动轻、噪音小、效率高、速度快，可乘坐十人。
