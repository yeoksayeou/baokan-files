Many economists gathered in New York to discuss "Europe—1992"
The European unified market is both a challenge and an opportunity

New York, Feb. 1 (Xinhua) — At the "Europe—1992" economic discussion held today in New York, many economists believe that the European Community's plan to establish a unified market in 1992 presents both challenges and opportunities for enterprises in Europe and other regions.

The challenge lies in the fact that European Community countries will break down their national borders, intensifying competition among enterprises. The opportunity arises because intensified competition will inevitably drive participating enterprises to improve their efficiency.

This challenge and opportunity are not only faced by enterprises in European Community countries but also by those in the United States, Japan, and other regions.

Peter Frederick, deputy assistant secretary of the U.S. Department of Commerce, said at the meeting, "The European plan to establish a unified market in 1992 is also an opportunity for U.S. enterprises. The U.S. government is very interested in this."

He believes that U.S. enterprises, by participating in the European market competition, will enhance their overall competitiveness, including production efficiency and product quality, among other aspects.

The committee's expert on international economic issues said, "The low exchange rate of the dollar and the prospect of a unified market in 1992 are prompting Western Europe to reduce its dependence on the United States for military and market support, instead relying on its own market and economic development."

Experts attending the meeting believe that the unification of European Community countries will provide the United States with a more powerful political and trade partner.

However, the United States may face a more independent, stronger, but less cooperative partner in the global balance of power.

　　许多经济学家聚会纽约讨论“欧洲—１９９２”
　　欧洲统一市场是挑战又是机遇
    新华社纽约２月１日电  （记者薛力敏）在今天于此间召开的“欧洲—１９９２”经济讨论会上，许多经济学家认为，欧洲共同体在１９９２年建立统一市场的计划，对于欧洲和其他地区的企业来说，既是挑战，也是机遇。
    说挑战，是因为欧洲共同体国家打破彼此之间的国界，从而加剧了各国企业之间的竞争；说机遇，是因为竞争的加剧必然促使参加竞争的企业提高效率。
    这种挑战与机遇不仅摆在欧洲共同体国家的企业面前，也摆在美国、日本和其他地区的企业面前。
    美国商务部助理部长帮办彼得·弗雷德里克在会上说，“欧洲在１９９２年建立统一市场的计划对美国企业也是个机遇，美国政府对此很感兴趣。”
    他认为，美国企业在参与欧洲市场的竞争中，必将提高自己的综合竞争能力，包括生产效率和产品质量等等。
    会议委员会国际经济问题专家说，“美元的低汇率和１９９２年的统一市场前景正在促使西欧改变对美国军事和市场的依赖地位，转而依靠欧洲自己的市场和经济发展”。
    与会的专家们认为，欧洲共同体国家的统一，可以使美国有一个更加强大的政治和贸易伙伴。
    但是，美国可能因此而在全球力量平衡中面对一个更加独立、更加强大却不太好说话的伙伴。
