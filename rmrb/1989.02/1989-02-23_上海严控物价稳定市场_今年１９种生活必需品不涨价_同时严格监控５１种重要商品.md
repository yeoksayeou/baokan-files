Shanghai Tightly Controls Prices to Stabilize the Market

Today 19 Essential Goods Will Not See Price Increases

Simultaneously, 51 Key Commodities Will Be Strictly Monitored

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, February 22nd: According to a report by our correspondent Lü Wǎngdà, the Shanghai Municipal People's Government has decided that 19 essential goods will not see price increases this year, and 51 important commodities will be strictly monitored to ensure market stability.

The 19 goods that will not see price increases this year include: rationed rice, flour, cooking oil, sugar, pork, halal beef, fresh eggs, poultry (partial supply during the Spring Festival and National Day), infant milk cakes, matches, laundry soap, civilian coal, rationed cigarettes, as well as soy sauce, vinegar, 17 common vegetables, student notebooks, thermos flasks, and toilet paper.

The 51 monitored commodities are generally divided into three categories: the first category includes staple and supplementary foods that are essential to the people's basic living needs; the second category includes industrial goods that are necessary for citizens' daily lives; and the third category includes durable consumer goods that can stabilize the market and circulate currency.

Shanghai will monitor the 51 commodities in three aspects: production arrangements, commercial procurement, and sales channels. The municipal government has established a leading group for monitored commodities, consisting of the Commission of Economy and Planning, the Commission of Economy and Trade, the Agricultural Commission, the Financial and Commercial Office, and comprehensive economic departments. The group will prioritize energy, raw materials, and funding in production, ensure smooth transitions between production and commercial procurement, and prevent excessive outflow in sales channels.

　　上海严控物价稳定市场
    今年１９种生活必需品不涨价   
    同时严格监控５１种重要商品
    本报上海２月２２日电  记者吕网大报道：上海市人民政府决定，１９种人民生活必需品今年不涨价，对关系人民生活和市场影响较大的５１种重要商品实行监控。
    这１９种今年不涨价商品是：定量供应的大米、面粉、食油、食糖、猪肉、清真牛肉、鲜蛋、家禽（春节、国庆按户供应部分）、婴儿奶糕、火柴、洗衣皂、民用煤、凭票卷烟，以及酱油、食醋、１７种大路蔬菜、学生课业簿册、保温瓶胆、卫生纸。
    ５１种实行监控的商品大体分为三类：第一类是关系群众基本生活需要的主副食品，第二类是市民生活必需的工业品，第三类包括能稳定市场、回笼货币的耐用消费品。
    上海市对５１种商品从生产安排、商业收购、销售流向等三个方面实行监控。市政府成立了由计委、经委、农委、财贸办和综合经济部门参加的监控商品领导小组，并决定生产上在能源、原材料和资金等方面给予优先安排，商业收购上搞好与生产的衔接，销售流向上防止过多外流。
