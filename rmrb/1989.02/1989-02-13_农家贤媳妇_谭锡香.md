In the town of Chengguan, Yicheng County, Hubei, near the Han River, there is a farming woman named Tan Xixiang. People respect her and call her the "exemplary daughter-in-law of a farming family." In October 1988, she was awarded the title of "National Exemplary Child to the Elderly."

Shen Mingxiu lost two daughters in her youth. In 1968, her husband, who was over 80 years old, passed away. The elderly Shen Mingxiu was left alone in a dilapidated thatched hut, crying whenever she saw someone.

Those were tough times for everyone. Tan Xixiang had two children, one aged three and the other not yet a year old. Her husband was serving in the army, and life was very difficult. But whenever she returned from the fields, passing by Shen Mingxiu's thatched hut, tears would well up in her eyes. She couldn't bear to see the old woman living such a lonely and miserable life, so she went to persuade Shen Mingxiu to live with her.

That night, Xixiang wrote a long letter to her husband, seeking his opinion.

Her husband, Zhou Wanfu, was a military officer and highly approved of his wife's action. He replied with encouragement.

Xixiang cleared out half a room and moved Shen Mingxiu into her home. On moving day, Shen Mingxiu refused to go, tears streaming down her face as she said, "I... I have had a miserable life and don't want to trouble your family."

"Old Mrs. Shen, don't say that. Everyone gets old," Xixiang said, helping the old woman into her home.

From then on, Shen Mingxiu became a member of Xixiang's family. In spring, Xixiang would change the old woman's clothes to lighter ones; in autumn, she would sew warm clothes for her. When it got cold, she would use a hot water bottle to warm the old woman's bed. Although Xixiang had to manage everything inside and outside the home, with meager income and a hard life, she always made sure the old woman's clothes were clean and mended, and even in the toughest times, when there was no rice to cook, she would borrow grain and money, but never let the old woman go hungry or cold.

Soon, the military sent a letter calling Xixiang to join her husband. This news was like a sparkling gem, dazzling everyone.

Joining her husband was a dream come true for many rural women and a very fortunate thing for a military officer's wife.

But Xixiang said, "I'm not going anywhere. I'll take care of Old Mrs. Shen for the rest of her life."

Once Xixiang made up her mind, not even twelve horses could pull her back.

She stayed with her children and continued to take care of Shen Mingxiu as before...

Later, her husband transferred to a civilian job, and the children grew up. The rural economy changed, and life became much better. She built a new brick house and specially arranged for Shen Mingxiu to live in a room that was bright and sunny.

Tan Xixiang, with her beautiful heart, took care of a centenarian, and also cultivated a noble family tradition. Her husband, after returning from the military, had his military sheep-skin coat altered for Shen Mingxiu to wear. Her eldest daughter, upon starting work, used her salary to buy Shen Mingxiu fur shoes, sweaters, and pants. After getting married, she still brought her husband to visit Old Mrs. Shen often. Her son, after going to college, saved his living expenses to buy a small radio for Old Mrs. Shen.

Twenty years passed in the blink of an eye. In these twenty years, how many days and nights were there! Tan Xixiang's forehead bore the wrinkles of hard times. Now, the 81-year-old widow Shen Mingxiu has turned 101 and is still enjoying a leisurely life...

　　“农家贤媳妇”——谭锡香
    全国锋
    在汉江之滨的湖北宜城县城关５组，有一位姓谭名锡香的农家妇女，人们敬佩她，称她为“农家贤媳妇”。１９８８年金秋１０月，荣获“全国敬老好儿女”称号。
    沈明秀年轻时生的两个女儿，先后都夭折了。１９６８年，８０多岁的丈夫又去世了，耄耋之年的沈明秀守着那间破草棚，见人就哭。
    那年月，人们的日子都难熬。谭锡香拉着两个孩子，大的３岁，小的还未满周岁，丈夫在外面当兵，生活十分拮据，但每逢从地里收工回来，路过沈老人的破草棚，锡香的眼角便被泪水润湿了。她不忍心眼巴巴看着沈老人去过那种孤独凄苦的生活，便去劝沈老人跟自己一块过。
    晚上，锡香给丈夫写了一封长信，征询丈夫的意见。
    丈夫周万福是个部队干部，对妻子的这一行动十分赞赏，便回信鼓励她。
    锡香腾出半间空屋，把沈老人家搬了过来。搬家那天，沈老人高低不肯，噙着热泪说：“我这……这辈子命苦，也不……不能连累你们一家人受罪呀！”
    “沈老太，别这么说，哪个人不老呢？”锡香把老人扶到了自己的家中。
    从此沈老人就成了锡香家中的一员。春天，锡香给老人换单衣；秋天，老早就给老人缝棉衣；天冷了，就用热水瓶子给老人焐被子。虽说是里里外外全靠锡香一个人，收入微薄，日子过得很艰苦，可再忙再穷，锡香总是把沈老人的衣服洗得干干净净，补得整整齐齐，即使在最困难的时候，没有米下锅，借粮借钱，也没叫沈老人受冻挨饿。
    不久，部队来函叫锡香随军。这消息就是一颗七彩的明珠，耀得人们眼花缭乱。
    随军，这是当时农村姐妹梦寐以求的愿望，也是军人的妻子再风光不过的大好事。
    但锡香表示：“哪也不去，养活沈老人一辈子。”
    谭锡香拿稳了的事，１２匹大马也拉不回。
    她带着她的孩子留下了，一如既往地照顾沈老人……
    后来，丈夫转到了地方工作，孩子也大了。农村经济发生了变化，日子过得蛮红火。她盖了新瓦房，专门把沈老人安住在透光迎太阳的房间。
    谭锡香用她那美好的心灵，赡养着一位百岁老人，也酿造出一个高尚的家风。丈夫转业回来，叫妻子把军用羊皮袄改给沈老人穿。大女儿一参加工作，就用自己的工资给沈老人买毛皮鞋、毛衣、毛裤，出嫁后，还带爱人常来看沈老太。儿子上大学后，节约生活费用给沈老太买微型收音机。
    转眼间２０年过去了，这２０年该有多少个日日夜夜呀！谭锡香额上留下艰苦岁月的皱纹。如今，当年８１岁的孤寡老人沈明秀已翻过１０１岁，还悠闲地享着清福……
