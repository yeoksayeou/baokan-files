The PLO condemned Israel for sabotaging the U.S.-PLO dialogue. Arafat said the U.S. and the Soviet Union had reached an agreement on convening an international peace conference for the Middle East. The U.S. criticized Israel for human rights violations and said conflicts between the PLO and Israel would affect the U.S.-PLO dialogue.

	NEW DELHI, Feb. 7 (Xinhua) -- PLO Executive Committee Chairman Yasser Arafat said on Feb. 7 that Washington and Moscow had reached a principled agreement on convening an international peace conference for the Middle East during their recent two summits.

	Arafat told the French International Radio that the U.S. had committed to supporting the convening of a Middle East peace conference last December, which led to Washington's acceptance of starting a dialogue with the PLO.

	Arafat expressed his satisfaction with President Bush's decision to continue this dialogue. He announced that the U.S. and the PLO are in contact through various means in Tunis.

	Regarding the establishment of a Palestinian government, Arafat said that no decision would be made before consulting with brotherly and friendly countries.

	CAIRO, Feb. 7 (Xinhua) -- Some officials of the PLO today condemned Israel for opposing the PLO and attempting to sabotage the U.S.-PLO dialogue.

	Abou Iyad, a member of the Fatah Central Committee who arrived in Cairo today, pointed out that the world now recognizes that the PLO is not a terrorist organization. Israel's insistence on labeling the PLO as a terrorist organization is nothing new. He said that Israel has no final say in the U.S.'s decision to start a dialogue with the PLO.

	Another report said that Mohammed Subahi, Secretary of the Palestine National Council, pointed out today that Israel's accusation that the PLO has violated its pledge to renounce terrorism lacks persuasiveness in the face of world opinion. He said that Israel's demand for the U.S. to sever dialogue with the PLO is naive and futile. Israeli Foreign Minister Arens today accused the PLO of killing five Palestinians seeking cooperation with Israel last month and urged the U.S. to sever the U.S.-PLO dialogue on this basis.

	WASHINGTON, Feb. 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. State Department spokesman, Richard Boucher, criticized the PLO for clashes with Israeli forces in southern Lebanon and said the U.S. would raise this issue with the PLO.

	Boucher said the U.S. attaches great importance to such incidents because they will have an adverse impact on the prospects for U.S.-PLO dialogue and Palestinian-Israeli dialogue.

	Israel accused the PLO of violating its pledge to renounce terrorism to the U.S. and approved a guerrilla unit to attack Israeli forces on Feb. 6.

	PLO spokesman Abdul Rahman said these guerrillas were fighting to oppose Israel's occupation of southern Lebanon and to defend Palestinian camps.

	WASHINGTON, Feb. 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. State Department said today that Israel's repression of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip last year had significantly increased human rights violations.

	The State Department's annual report on human rights around the world criticized Israeli military actions against Palestinian resistance over the past year. The report said their actions had caused "many unnecessary casualties" among Palestinians.

	According to reports, since the Palestinians began their uprising in December 1987, 374 Palestinians have been killed and more than 20,000 injured.

　　巴解谴责以色列破坏美巴对话
　  阿拉法特说美苏就召开中东和会达成协议
    美批评以侵犯人权又称巴解同以发生冲突将影响美巴对话
    新华社突尼斯二月七日电　据突尼斯非洲通讯社报道，巴解组织执委会主席阿拉法特七日说，华盛顿和莫斯科在最近的两次美苏首脑会晤中，已就召开中东和平国际会议问题达成了原则协议。
    阿拉法特在对法国国际电台的谈话中说，美国承担义务支持召开中东和会在去年十二月就已定了下来，这导致了华盛顿接受同巴解组织开始对话。
    阿拉法特对布什总统决定将这种对话继续进行下去感到高兴。他宣布，美巴正在突尼斯通过各种方法进行接触。
    他在谈到成立巴勒斯坦政府问题时说，在同兄弟和友好国家进行协商之前，不会作出这样的决定。
    新华社开罗二月七日电　巴解组织一些官员今天谴责以色列反对巴解组织，企图破坏美国同巴解组织对话。
    今天抵达开罗访问的巴勒斯坦民族解放运动（法塔赫）中央委员阿布·伊亚德指出，现在全世界认为巴解组织不是恐怖主义组织，以色列坚持把巴解组织打成恐怖主义组织的立场不是什么新货色。他说，以色列对美国同巴解组织对话的决定没有最终发言权。
    另据报道，巴勒斯坦全国委员会书记穆哈默德·苏巴伊今天指出，在世界舆论面前，以色列所谓的巴解组织违背放弃恐怖主义诺言的指责是没有说服力的。他说，以色列要求美国断绝同巴解组织的对话是幼稚和徒劳的。以色列外长阿伦斯今天指控巴解组织上月杀害了五名谋求同以色列合作的巴勒斯坦人，并以此为由敦促美国断绝美巴对话。
    新华社华盛顿二月七日电美国国务院发言人雷德曼七日批评巴解组织在黎巴嫩南部同以色列军队发生冲突，并声称美国将向巴解组织提出此事。
    雷德曼说，美国非常重视这类事件，因为它将对美国同巴解组织对话和巴以对话的前景造成不利影响。
    以色列指责巴解组织违背其向美国作出的放弃恐怖主义的诺言，批准一支游击队于二月六日袭击以色列军队。
  巴解组织发言人阿卜杜尔—拉赫曼说，这些游击队员是为反对以色列占领黎巴嫩南部和保卫巴勒斯坦军营而战的。
    新华社华盛顿二月七日电美国国务院今天说，以色列去年在约旦河西岸和加沙地带被占领土上对巴勒斯坦人的镇压使以色列侵犯人权的行为“大幅度增加”。
    国务院在一份关于世界范围人权情况的年度报告中批评以色列军队对巴勒斯坦人一年多来的反抗所采取的行动。报告说，他们的举动给巴勒斯坦人造成了“许多不必要的伤亡”。
    据报道，自一九八七年十二月巴勒斯坦人开始举行反抗活动以来，已有三百七十四名巴勒斯坦人被杀，二万多人受伤。
