Breaking bad habits requires persistence

Yè Bàn

Smoking is not a national treasure. Since the introduction of "tobacco" from abroad in the late Ming Dynasty, it has only been around for four or five hundred years. However, the number of "smokers" in China today is already the highest in the world.

Just look at the past ten years. The campaigns to publicize the harms of smoking and to discourage smoking have been held year after year, and the scale has been considerable. But what has been the result? According to the survey results released today from six cities, the number of smokers in cities is still on the rise; more worrisome is that the number of young "new smokers" is increasing year by year.

What is particularly thought-provoking is that 74.49% of smokers believe that smoking is harmful to health, yet they continue to smoke. Despite the fact that the price of premium cigarettes has risen much faster than books and newspapers, those who appreciate them do not subscribe to newspapers or buy books but still buy cigarettes to smoke. Tobacco companies from Europe and America have easily entered the vast Chinese market, which is indeed because our compatriots, either openly or secretly, have "welcomed" them in.

Smoking is easy to become addictive, and over time it becomes a bad habit. An elder revolutionary once wrote a poem: "Breaking bad habits requires persistence, boil quickly and steam slowly." On April 7 last year, "World No-Tobacco Day," many of our compatriots quit smoking for a day, but the next day they smoked as usual. The propaganda and discouragement efforts then faded away, and the "addicts" thus felt at ease continuing their addiction. In many of our endeavors, we often fall short due to a lack of perseverance and endurance. Bad habits in society are difficult to break, and this is not just the case with smoking. When will we cultivate a national spirit of perseverance and tenacity? Many of China's problems would be much easier to solve.

　　革除积习须持久
    叶伴
    吸烟并非国粹。从明末“淡巴古”自外洋传入算起，不过四五百年历史。然而如今的华夏“烟民”之众，早已是世界之最。
    就说近十年来吧，宣传吸烟有害和劝阻吸烟的活动岁岁复年年，规模不可谓不大。然而效果呢？据今天披露的六城市调查结果，城市吸烟人数仍呈上升趋势；更值得忧虑的是，青少年中的“后补烟民”逐年增多。
    尤其发人深思的，是吸烟者的７４．４９％相信吸烟有害健康，而照样吞云吐雾。尽管名烟涨价比书报涨价厉害得多，好之者不订报不购书也要买烟抽。欧美的烟草公司轻易打进庞大的中国市场，实在是咱们的同胞或明或暗“迎”进来的。
    吸烟易成瘾，日久为积习。一位老一辈革命家曾有诗云：“革除积习须持久，紧火煮完慢火蒸。”去年４月７日“世界无烟日”，咱们的许多同胞戒了一日烟，第二天便照抽不误，宣传与劝阻随之销声匿迹，“瘾君子”们于是心安理得去过“瘾”。咱们在办不少事情时，往往吃亏就吃在无恒心、缺韧劲，社会上的不良积习难以戒除，是不独吸烟为然的。何时养成举国上下锲而不舍的顽强民风，中国的许多事情就好办得多了。
