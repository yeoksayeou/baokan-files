Japanese renowned manga artist Tezuka Osamu passed away today in Tokyo due to stomach cancer, aged 60.

Tezuka Osamu, who was fond of manga since childhood, began publishing manga stories in newspapers at the age of 18. He graduated from Osaka University's School of Medicine in his early years, but after graduation, he did not pick up the scalpel but became a painter, picking up the brush. In 1951, at the age of 23, Tezuka created "Astro Boy," which was serialized in a youth magazine and caused a sensation.

The Japanese art world highly evaluates Tezuka, believing that he infused narrative and thought into manga, making him a pioneer in bringing manga stories into the adult world. His death marks the end of an era in the history of Japanese post-war manga.

　　日著名漫画家手塚治虫病逝
    新华社东京２月９日电  （记者姚力）《铁臂阿童木》的作者、日本著名漫画家手塚治虫因患胃癌，今天在东京去世，终年６０岁。
    手塚治虫自幼酷爱漫画，从１８岁时开始在报纸上连载漫画故事。他早年毕业于大阪大学医学系，但他毕业后并未拿起手术刀，而是当了画家，拿起了画笔。１９５１年，２３岁的手塚创作的《铁臂阿童木》在少年杂志上连载后引起轰动。
    日本艺术界对手塚的评价极高，认为他将故事性和思想性注入漫画之中，是漫画故事进入成人世界的开拓者。他的死标志着日本战后漫画史中一个时代的结束。
