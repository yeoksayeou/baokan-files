	For the upcoming multi-party elections, 200 political parties in Myanmar have registered with the authorities.
	The official newspaper of Myanmar, the "Workers' Daily," reported today that as of February 23rd, 200 political parties have registered with the authorities.
	Many people here believe that the most popular party among these is the National League for Democracy, chaired by former Defense Minister Tin U and with Aung San Suu Kyi, daughter of Myanmar's founding father Aung San, as its general secretary. Other powerful parties include the National Unity Party (formerly the ruling Burma Socialist Programme Party) and the League for Democracy and Peace, chaired by former President U Nu and supported by former Prime Minister U Thant.
	Following the nationwide pro-democracy demonstrations and strikes last year, the Myanmar authorities decided on September 10th to implement a multi-party system. After the military took control on September 18th, some parties were allowed to register in preparation for the multi-party elections.
	According to the Election Commission's announcement last month, the deadline for party registration is February 28th.

　　为参加多党大选
    缅甸二百政党登记
    新华社仰光２月２４日电  缅甸官方的《劳动人民日报》今天报道，截至２３日缅甸已有２００个政党向当局登记注册。
    此间许多人士认为，这些政党中最受欢迎的是以前国防部长丁吴为主席、缅甸联邦创始人昂山的女儿昂山素季为总书记的全国民主联盟。力量强大的其他政党还有民族团结党（即以前执政的缅甸社会主义纲领党）和以前总理吴努为赞助人、前总统吴温貌为主席的争取民主与和平联盟。
    缅甸当局在去年发生的全国规模的要求民主的示威和罢工之后，于９月１０日决定缅甸实行多党制。军人９月１８日接管政权后允许一些政党登记以便进行多党大选。
    根据选举委员会上个月宣布，政党登记的截止日期是２月２８日。
