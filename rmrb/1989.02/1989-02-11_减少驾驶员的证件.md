Reduce the Number of Driver's Documents

In recent years, truck drivers have had to carry more than ten different documents while on the road. Some units have been arbitrarily collecting fees and setting up checkpoints, making it increasingly difficult for drivers to operate. The numerous documents drivers must carry can be divided into two categories: driving documents (such as driver's licenses, vehicle permits, and insurance certificates) and road usage fee vouchers (such as road maintenance fee payment certificates, management fee vouchers, and vehicle purchase additional fee certificates).

In China, the management of road transportation is primarily the responsibility of the public security and transportation departments. However, currently, many departments are involved in managing road traffic, leading to a chaotic situation. For example, in my county, the collection of road usage fees is handled by different departments: the vehicle purchase additional fee is collected by the supervising bureau, the management fee is collected by the transportation management department, the road maintenance fee for trucks is collected by the road department, and the road maintenance fee for tractors is collected by the township traffic management office. There is no unified management body in the county, and each collecting unit reports to its own higher authority. If they do not set up checkpoints or inspect vehicles, how can these fees be collected in full?

To change this situation, I propose the following:

1. The public security department should focus on safety and combine the driver's license and vehicle permit into a "Safe Driving Certificate." This would ensure that each driver and vehicle has a specific certificate, which is beneficial for safety.

2. The transportation department should break away from the current system where the supervising bureau, road department, and transportation management department each collect fees separately. Instead, they should establish a unified road usage fee collection agency and issue a single road usage fee voucher. This way, drivers can pay all their fees in one place, making it convenient for transportation units and individuals, and improving the efficiency of the relevant departments. At the same time, drivers would only need to carry a few documents while on the road, making inspections easier.

### 减少驾驶员的证件

　　减少驾驶员的证件
    近几年，公路运输中，司机随身携带的证件达１０多种，一些单位乱收费，乱设卡的现象有增无减，行车难的呼声越来越高。司机携带的诸多证件，可分为两大类：行车证件（驾驶证、行车证、保险费证等）和行车交通费凭证（养路费统缴证、管理费凭证、车辆购置附加费证等）。
    我国公路交通运输管理的工作，主要是由公安与交通部门负责。但是，现在却有不少部门都管公路行车，造成了交通管理混乱的局面。以我县征收行车费用的情况为例，车辆购置附加费由主管局征收，运管费由运输管理部门征收，汽车养路费由公路部门征收，拖拉机养路费由乡镇交通管理所征收。县里没有统一管理机构，由收费单位各向各自的上级负责，如不设卡、不查车，这些费用怎么能收得齐？
    为改变这种状况，我建议：
    一、公安部门应以安全为中心，将驾驶证、行车证等合并为“安全行驶证”。这样，可以实现专人、专车、专证，有利于安全。
    二、交通部门应打破现行的主管局、公路、运输管理部门等分别收费的管理体系，成立有关收费机构，签发统一的行车费用凭证。这样，司机进一家的门，就能交齐所有费用，既方便运输单位和个人，又使有关部门提高了办事效率。同时，司机行车只需带几个证件，便于稽查。
