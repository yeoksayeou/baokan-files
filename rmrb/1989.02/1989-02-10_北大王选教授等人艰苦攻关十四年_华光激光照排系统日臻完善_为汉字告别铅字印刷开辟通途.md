Beijing University Professor Wang Xuan and others have worked tirelessly for 14 years to develop the "Huaguang" laser typesetting system, which has gradually improved and is now ready for use. This system marks a significant step forward in the history of Chinese printing technology.

The "Huaguang" system's success in development provides a smooth path for the world's most complex writing system, Chinese characters, to transition away from lead typesetting. This marks the beginning of a new era in Chinese printing technology.

The first domestic user of the "Huaguang" system is the Xinhua News Agency. In May 1985, the "Xinhua News Wire" successfully adopted the "Huaguang II" computer-to-laser Chinese typesetting system. The widely circulated "Economic Daily," with a circulation of over a million copies both domestically and internationally, began using the "Huaguang" system to renovate its printing plant. By the end of 1987, the system had passed inspections by relevant state departments. Xia Tianjun, the director of the Economic Daily Printing Plant, introduced that they had dismantled the lead pots and eliminated lead typesetting. A small laser typesetting workshop now handles the typesetting for 33 newspapers and 11 periodicals in the capital, doubling production efficiency. Daily typesetting capacity has reached 500,000 characters. Previously, the annual typesetting volume was around 85 million characters, but last year it exceeded 140 million characters. Xia Tianjun said that using the "Huaguang" system not only improved efficiency and working conditions for printers, eliminating the risk of lead poisoning and reducing labor intensity, but also significantly enhanced printing technology. From page layout to error reduction and printing effects, there has been a qualitative leap.

The development of the "Huaguang" laser typesetting system began in August 1974 under the leadership of Professor Wang Xuan. After 14 years of arduous efforts, four different models of publishing and printing systems have been successfully developed. The "Huaguang" system launched in 1988 combines the advantages of batch processing for standardized and aesthetically pleasing typesetting with the convenience of easy learning. It is the only domestic system that supports two processing methods. With a rich variety of font sizes, integrated text and images, and the ability to freely adjust and modify complex layouts, it is suitable for typesetting newspapers, magazines, scientific books, circuit diagrams, tables, and musical scores, all of which can be arranged and output on a large screen.

Fan Mukai, the president of the China Printing and Equipment Industry Association, commented that the "Huaguang" system is currently the only domestically produced printing equipment with both software and hardware. It is also the leading equipment for laser typesetting of Chinese characters in the world, holding an irreplaceable position in the domestic and global Chinese character printing field, with significant promotional value. It is reported that more than 60 central, provincial, and municipal newspapers have already adopted or are preparing to adopt the "Huaguang" laser typesetting system. By 1990, all provincial-level newspapers and some periodicals in the country will basically use this typesetting system. By the end of the century, all newspapers and publishing houses in China will have fully transitioned to laser typesetting. At that time, lead typesetting in China will become a historical relic.

　　北大王选教授等人艰苦攻关十四年
　　华光激光照排系统日臻完善
　　为汉字告别铅字印刷开辟通途
    新华社北京２月９日电  （记者杨理科）被称为中国古代四大发明之一的毕升活字印刷术，在人类文明史上写下了光辉的篇章。近千年之后，北京大学王选教授等人推出的“华光”激光照排出版系统，又一次引起当代世界印刷界的惊叹，被誉为中国印刷技术的再革命。
    中国印刷及设备工业协会会长范慕韩在向记者介绍这一技术时说，“华光”系统的研制成功，为世界上最浩繁的文字——汉字告别铅字印刷提供了通畅大道，将开始我国印刷术的新纪元。
    国内率先使用“华光”系统的是新华通讯社。１９８５年５月，《新华社新闻稿》首次采用“华光Ⅱ型计算机——激光汉字编排系统”获得成功。国内外发行上百万份的《经济日报》，试用“华光”系统，改造印刷厂，１９８７年底通过国家有关部门的鉴定。《经济日报》印刷厂厂长夏天俊介绍，他们已经拆除了铅锅，取消了铅排。小小的激光照排车间担负着首都３３家报纸１１种期刊的排版任务，生产效益比过去整整翻了两番。日排字达到５０万字。过去年排字量仅有８５００万字左右，去年的排字量已超过１４０００万字。夏天俊说，使用“华光”系统，不仅提高了效率，改善了工人劳动环境，使印刷工人解除了铅粉中毒之虞，减轻了劳动强度，而且印刷工艺水平也得到空前提高，从版面编排到减少错误以至印刷效果都有了质的飞跃。
    “华光”激光照排系统的研制工作始于１９７４年８月。由王选教授主持这一工作。经过１４年的艰苦攻关，已先后推出四种型号的出版印刷系统。１９８８年推出的“华光”系统，既有整批处理排版规范美观的优点，又有方便易学的长处，为国内唯一具备两种处理方式的系统。字号变化丰富，文图合一，复杂版面可随意调换和修改，不仅适合报纸、刊物排版，科技书、电路图、报表、五线谱等特殊版面，皆可在大屏幕上编排输出。
    范慕韩会长评价，“华光”系统是国内目前唯一具有国产化软、硬件的印刷设备，也是当今世界汉字印刷激光照排的领衔设备，在国内和世界上汉字印刷领域有着不可替代的地位，很有推广价值。据介绍，国内现有６０多家中央、省、市的报社已经采用或准备采用“华光”激光照排系统。到１９９０年，全国省级以上的报纸和部分书刊将基本采用这一照排系统。到本世纪末，全国的报纸和出版社将全部实现激光照排。届时，中国的铅字印刷将成为历史文物。
