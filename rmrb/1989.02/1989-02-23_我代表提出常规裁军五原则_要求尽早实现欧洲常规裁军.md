China today welcomed the positive progress made in East-West arms reduction talks and expressed the hope that the relevant parties would reach an agreement on the early realization of conventional arms reduction in Europe as soon as possible.

China's Ambassador for Disarmament Affairs, Fan Guoxiang, said in a speech at the 40-nation disarmament negotiations conference of the United Nations that the early realization of conventional arms reduction in Europe would be beneficial to the security and stability of Europe and the world.

Fan Guoxiang emphasized the importance and urgency of conventional arms reduction in his speech.

Fan Guoxiang proposed that to promote the substantive progress of conventional arms reduction, some commonly followed principles should be considered. These principles include:

First, the two superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union, which possess the largest military arsenals, should bear special responsibilities for conventional arms reduction;

Second, the military forces of all countries should only be used for self-defense. It is encouraged that countries, while considering the need to ensure security and maintain necessary defense capabilities, independently take appropriate actions within the regional scope to promote the progress of conventional arms reduction and strengthen peace and security;

Third, all occupying forces abroad should be withdrawn, and all forms of military occupation on foreign territories should be ended;

Fourth, the troops and armaments reduced from one region should not be transferred to other regions;

Fifth, the resources saved from conventional arms reduction should be used for the economic and social development of society.

　　我代表提出常规裁军五原则　要求尽早实现欧洲常规裁军
    新华社日内瓦２月２１日电  中国今天对东西方裁军谈判取得的积极进展表示欢迎，并期待有关各方尽早就实现欧洲常规裁军达成协议。
    中国裁军事务大使范国祥在联合国４０国裁军谈判会议上发言时指出，尽早实现欧洲常规裁军将有利于欧洲和世界的安全与稳定。
    范国祥在讲话中强调了常规裁军的重要意义和迫切性。
    范国祥提出，为促进常规裁军取得切实进展，应考虑一些共同遵循的原则。这些原则包括：
    第一，美苏两个拥有最大军事武库的超级大国应对常规裁军负起特别责任；
    第二，所有国家的军事力量只应用于自卫，应鼓励各国在考虑保障安全和保持必要防务能力需要的同时，努力并独立地在区域范围内采取适当行动，以促进常规裁军的进展和加强和平与安全；
    第三，撤出在国外的全部占领军，结束在外国领土上的各种军事占领；
    第四，从一个地区裁减下来的兵力和军备不能转移到其它地区；
    第五，从常规裁军节省下来的资源，应用于社会的经济和发展。
