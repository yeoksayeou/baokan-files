	Tangshan has made significant progress in the collection of personal income adjustment tax, a task considered challenging by tax authorities. In 1988, the city collected 1.043 million yuan in personal income adjustment tax, an increase of 3.6 times compared to the previous year, making it the highest in Hebei Province.

	In strengthening the management of personal income adjustment tax, Tangshan has insisted on letting the tax law speak, creating a favorable environment for tax collection. The city's tax authorities distributed over 10,000 copies of promotional booklets to various taxpayers. They also utilized newspapers, radio, promotional displays, and exhibitions to ensure that the tax law is understood by everyone, thereby enhancing taxpayers' awareness of the law and their willingness to pay taxes voluntarily.

	At the same time, the city conducted a thorough investigation and analysis of the tax source distribution. Based on this, they redefined a number of withholding agents, further improving relevant systems.

	In the process of collecting personal income adjustment tax, they dared to confront difficulties and break through barriers. In 1988, they identified 1,298 cases of tax evasion, collecting over 2 million yuan in back taxes.

　　唐山抓紧征收个人收入调节税
    去年入库税款居河北省之冠
    本报讯  被税务部门视为一大难点的个人收入调节税征收工作，在河北省唐山市取得突破。１９８８年，全市征收入库个人收入调节税１０４．３万元，比上年增长３．６倍，居河北省之冠。
    唐山在强化个人收入调节税的征管工作中，坚持让税法说话，创造良好的征管舆论环境。市税务部门把编印的１万多本宣传手册发到各个纳税户，同时利用报刊电台、宣传橱窗、图片展览等多种形式，使税法深入人心，家喻户晓，有效地增强了纳税者的法制观念和自觉遵章纳税的积极性。
    与此同时，全市在广泛开展税源分布状况调查分析的基础上，重新确定了一批代扣代缴单位，进一步完善了有关制度。
    在征收个人收入调节税中，他们敢于碰硬，攻破“暗堡”。去年共查出漏税１２９８人次，补交税款２０多万元。
