Afghan Resistance Forces Announce Election Results

Eight-Party Alliance Refuses to Participate Due to Seat Dispute

Our correspondent in Islamabad reports: According to the Bakhtar News Agency and television reports, the Afghan Resistance Forces Consultative Conference today elected Nabi Mohammadi as the interim government president and Ahmad Shah as the interim government prime minister.

According to reports, since the conference resumed on February 14, after several days of negotiations and discussions, the leadership of the interim government was finally elected today. Nabi Mohammadi was also elected as the chairman of the Supreme Council of the Resistance Forces and the chairman of the Leadership Council, a position equivalent to that of the interim head of state. After the election ceremony, the current chairman of the Afghan Resistance Forces Seven-Party Alliance, Mujaddidi, was the first to congratulate the two elected leaders, and other conference representatives shouted slogans such as "Long live Afghanistan!" and "The resistance forces will be victorious!" The members of the interim government cabinet will be announced after being approved at tomorrow's meeting.

It is also reported that the delegation of the Eight-Party Alliance led by Khalili has not participated in the consultative conference due to the unresolved seat dispute. The leaders of this faction of the resistance forces stated that they will hold their own consultative conference. According to today's report from the Frontier Post, there are 15 field commanders in Afghanistan planning to hold another consultative conference to counter the Seven-Party Alliance's consultative conference, and this conference is supported by the Kabul regime. There is also news that the first deputy foreign minister of the Soviet Union, Vorontsov, said that the Kabul government is negotiating with some guerrilla commanders to form a united government.

　　阿抵抗力量协商会议宣布选举结果    
    八党联盟因席位之争未参加
    本报伊斯兰堡２月１８日电  记者任毓骏报道：据巴通社和电视台消息，阿富汗抵抗力量协商会议今天选举纳比·穆赫默迪为临时政府总统，阿赫默德·沙阿为临时政府总理。
    据报道，协商会议自２月１４日复会以来，通过几天协商、讨论，今天终于选出了临时政府的领导人。纳比·穆赫默迪还当选为抵抗力量最高委员会主席和领袖委员会主席，其地位相当于临时国家首脑。选举仪式结束后，现任阿富汗抵抗力量七党联盟主席穆贾迪迪首先向这两位当选的领导人表示祝贺，其他会议代表也高呼“阿富汗万岁！”“抵抗力量必胜！”等口号。临时政府内阁成员将在明天会议上通过后再宣布。
    另据报道，以哈利利为首的八党联盟代表团因席位之争未解决一直没有参加协商会议，这一派抵抗力量领导人称将召开他们自己的协商会议。据《边疆邮报》今天消息，在阿富汗境内有１５名战地游击队司令正筹划召开另一个协商会议以和七党联盟的协商会议对抗，这一会议得到喀布尔政权的支持。还有消息说，苏联第一副外长沃龙佐夫称，喀布尔政府正在和一些游击队司令谈判成立联合政府。
