The Zhangjiakou region has boldly reformed the management and use of poverty alleviation funds, helping poor farmers quickly get on the path to prosperity. Since 1986, despite two consecutive years of severe natural disasters, 144,000 impoverished households have solved their food and clothing problems, and 82,300 impoverished households have reached the poverty alleviation standard.

The Zhangjiakou region is located in the outskirts of the Great Wall, with poor natural conditions and frequent disasters. Before 1983, the proportion of impoverished villages, households, and agricultural population in the region was 84.7%, 85.4%, and 80.6% respectively. To help the farmers in this region get out of poverty and become prosperous, the state allocates hundreds of millions of yuan annually for support. However, due to the "big pot meal" approach in the use of poverty alleviation funds, many farmers mistakenly believed that poverty alleviation funds were relief funds that did not need to be repaid. Some villages and towns focused on obtaining investments without considering the benefits, leading to low recovery rates, slow turnover, and poor economic benefits. Starting in 1986, the Zhangjiakou region implemented a series of reforms in the management and use of limited poverty alleviation funds:

	— Changing from "giving money for meals" to "providing capital." Except for providing unconditional relief to the elderly, the weak, the sick, the disabled, widows, orphans, and severely affected households, the majority of households with labor capacity are provided with interest-free, repayable support, with borrowing and repayment, and turnover use. In recent years, the region has allocated over 170 million yuan from the 600 million yuan in disaster relief funds for poverty alleviation, supporting 150,000 impoverished households to develop production and achieve good economic benefits.

	— Changing from allocating funds evenly to villages and towns to allocating funds based on projects, adhering to the principle of "no investment without project implementation, no investment without clear plans, no investment for low-output projects," and encouraging counties and towns to conduct thorough project investigation, evaluation, and selection. Each county has established a project development database, ensuring the optimal allocation and use of poverty alleviation funds. Since 1986, Guyuan County has used 13.17 million yuan in higher-level poverty alleviation funds to support 99 projects, achieving an annual tax revenue of 8.654 million yuan.

	— Changing from "scattering flowers from the sky" to concentrating funds for key development. In the past two years, the region has allocated 130.5 million yuan in poverty alleviation revolving funds and interest-subsidized loans, focusing on supporting 179 contiguous impoverished towns. The key support for the national poverty-stricken area of Shuanglu County's South Mountain area has used 16 million yuan in poverty alleviation funds over three years to establish 12 district-owned enterprises, supporting 7,800 impoverished households. By the end of last year, 4,700 households had solved their food and clothing problems, 3,500 households had reached the poverty alleviation standard, and the poverty alleviation rate was 45%.

	— Changing from multiple departments issuing and managing funds to a unified department issuing and managing funds. Last year, Chicheng County established a company for the economic development of impoverished regions, implementing unified management, issuance, repayment, and collection of national poverty alleviation funds, special poverty alleviation interest-subsidized loans, low-interest loans for old, minority, and impoverished regions, economic development loans for impoverished regions, and loans for supporting impoverished county enterprises. The company uses economic means to manage various poverty alleviation funds, solving problems such as dispersed fund allocation, lack of collection, favoritism, and leader projects caused by multiple departments managing and issuing funds.

　　投资不开大锅饭，注重提高经济效益    
    张家口地区用活管好扶贫资金
    本报讯  张家口地区大胆改革扶贫资金的管理使用办法，促使贫困农民尽快走上脱贫致富道路。从１９８６年以来，在全区连续两年遭受严重自然灾害的情况下，仍有１４．４万贫困户解决了温饱问题，有８．２３万贫困户达到了脱贫标准。
    张家口地区地处塞外，自然条件差，十年九灾。１９８３年以前，全区贫困村、贫困户和贫困人口分别占行政村、农户、农业人口总数的８４．７％、８５．４％、８０．６％。为了帮助该地区广大农民脱贫致富，国家每年拿出数百万元资金给予扶持。但由于扶贫资金使用上的“大锅饭”，许多农民错误地认为扶贫款即救济款，不必偿还。有些乡村一味争投资而很少考虑使用效益，造成资金回收率低、周转慢、经济效益差。从１９８６年开始，张家口地区为用好用活有限的扶贫资金，在管理和使用上实行了一系列改革：
    ——变“给饭钱”为“给本钱”。除了对老、弱、病、残、鳏、寡、孤、独和特重灾户实行无偿救济外，对有劳动能力的多数农户一律实行无息有偿扶持，有借有还，周转使用。近几年来，全区从６０００多万元救灾款中拿出１７００多万元用于扶贫，扶持１５万贫困户发展生产，取得了较好的经济效益。
    ——变按乡村平衡投放资金为按项目投放资金，坚持“开发项目不落实的不投放、定不准的不投放、产出低的不投放”的原则，促使各县乡认真做好项目考察、论证、筛选工作。各县都建立了项目开发库，保证了扶贫资金的优化投入和使用。沽源县从１９８６年以来，用上级拨给的１３１．７万元扶贫资金扶持了９９个项目，实现年利税８６．５４万元。
    ——变“天女散花”为集中资金重点开发。近两年多来，全地区投放扶贫周转金和贴息贷款１３０５万元，重点扶持了１７９个连片的贫困乡。重点扶持的全国贫困区涿鹿县南山区，三年共用１６０万扶贫款兴办起１２个区办企业，扶持贫困户７８００户。到去年年底，已有４７００户解决了温饱，３５００户达到脱贫标准，脱贫率达４５％。
    ——变多口发放管理资金为统一归口发放管理资金。去年，赤城县成立了贫困地区经济开发公司，对国家扶贫资金、专项扶贫贴息贷款、老少边穷低息贷款、贫困地区经济开发贷款、扶持贫困县企业贷款等资金，实行统管、统放、统还、统收。公司用经济手段管理各项扶贫资金，解决了由于多口管理发放资金形成的资金投向分散、有人投放无人催收、优亲厚友以及首长工程等弊端。
