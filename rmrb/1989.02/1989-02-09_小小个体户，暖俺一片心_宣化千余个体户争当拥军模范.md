Recently, the individual entrepreneur support team organized by the Industrial and Commercial Bureau and the Individual Laborers Association of Xuanhua County, Hebei Province, visited the camp of the Artillery Regiment of the Beijing Military Region stationed in the county. They provided services such as shoe repair, watch repair, haircuts, and bicycle repair for the soldiers. A soldier happily said, "Little individual entrepreneurs, warm our hearts."

Since 1981, in Xuanhua County, military personnel have been able to enjoy priority service and a 20% discount on services such as haircuts, shoe repair, watch repair, and clothing mending. Some services are only charged at cost. Individual entrepreneurs also regularly or spontaneously visit military camps to provide free services for military personnel. Last year alone, they voluntarily repaired 1,500 kitchen utensils, 600 bicycles, 2,500 watches, gave 8,000 haircuts, repaired 400 televisions, and trained 50 cooks. Many individual entrepreneurs also went to the military to teach techniques for making tofu, sprouting beans, raising pigs, and growing vegetables.

There are more than 1,200 individual entrepreneurs in the service industry in this county. Last year, 340 of them were awarded the title of "Model Support Household." Lan Chaojin, a 60-year-old shoe repairman, always gives priority to military personnel and charges less for each pair of shoes. During festivals, he carries his toolbox to the military camp to repair shoes for free. He often says to others, "We are now living in peaceful and prosperous times. We cannot forget that it is the soldiers who are protecting us. We cannot make money from the soldiers!" Last year, young individual entrepreneur Cao Zhanquan voluntarily repaired 400 watches for military personnel. The soldiers gratefully said to him, "Brother Cao, we don't want to let you suffer a loss." Cao Zhanquan smiled and replied, "You are fulfilling your duty for the country, and you only have so much subsidy each month. You don't mind suffering a loss, so what is this small matter to me?"

　　“小小个体户，暖俺一片心”
　　宣化千余个体户争当拥军模范
    本报讯  最近，河北省宣化县工商局和个体劳动者协会组织的个体户拥军服务队来到北京军区驻该地炮团的营区内，为战士们钉鞋、修表、理发、修自行车……一位战士乐滋滋地说：“小小个体户，暖俺一片心。”
    １９８１年以来，在宣化县，军人在个体户理发、钉鞋、修表、补衣服等，都可以享受服务优先、价格优惠２０％的待遇，有的只收成本费。个体户还定期有组织地或自发地到部队营区免费为军人服务，仅去年就义务为军人修理炊具１５００多件、自行车６００多辆、手表２５００多块、理发８０００多人次、修理电视机４００多部、培训炊事员５０多人。不少个体户到部队义务传授制做豆腐、生豆芽和养猪、种菜等技术。
    这个县从事服务行业的个体户１２００多家，去年有３４０户被评为“拥军模范户”。６０多岁的钉鞋匠兰朝金，向来对军人优先照顾，而且每双鞋少收两三角钱，逢年过节，他就背上自己的工具箱到军营义务钉鞋。他经常对别人说：“咱们现在过上了太平、富裕的日子，不能忘了是解放军在保卫着咱们，可不能赚当兵的钱！”青年个体户曹占全，去年义务为军人修理手表４００多块，战士们感激地对他说：“曹大哥，我们不忍心让你吃亏啊。”曹占全笑着回答：“你们为国家尽义务，一月只有那么点津贴费，你们还不嫌吃亏，我这点小事算什么。”
