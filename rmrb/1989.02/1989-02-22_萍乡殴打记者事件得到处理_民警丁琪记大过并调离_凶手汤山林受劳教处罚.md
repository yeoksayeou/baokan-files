The incident of police officer Ding Qi participating in the assault of journalists from Jiangxi Television in Pingxiang City, Jiangxi Province, has recently been handled.

On November 11 last year, three journalists from Jiangxi Television were on assignment in Pingxiang when they encountered traffic congestion and disorder. They suggested to the on-duty police officer Ding Qi that the traffic be cleared. Instead of accepting the suggestion, Ding Qi unreasonably stopped the journalists' car and harassed them. At this point, several people led by Tang Shanlin rushed forward and severely beat the three journalists. Ding Qi stood by and did not intervene.

After the incident, news organizations such as the China News Service and China Daily reported on it, and readers, viewers, and listeners reacted strongly, unanimously demanding the handling of the law-enforcing police officer Ding Qi and the assailants. The local residents of Pingxiang had an even stronger reaction.

The Jiangxi Provincial Public Security Bureau and Pingxiang City have decided to transfer Ding Qi out of the public security system and give him a demerit record. Tang Shanlin, the assailant, will receive one year of re-education through labor.

    本报南昌２月２０日电  发生在江西萍乡市的一起由民警参与殴打江西电视台记者的事件，最近得到处理。
    去年１１月１１日，江西电视台３名记者在萍乡采访途中，见交通堵塞、秩序混乱，便向值勤民警丁琪提出疏通的建议。丁琪非但不接受，还无理拦下记者的汽车纠缠，这时以汤山林为首的几个人上前毒打３名记者，丁琪在旁未加任何阻拦。
    事件发生后，中国新闻社、中国日报等新闻单位作了报道，读者和观众、听众的反应强烈，一致要求处理执法犯法的民警丁琪和打人凶手。萍乡当地群众反响更为强烈。
    江西省公安厅和萍乡市已决定将丁琪调出公安系统，给予行政记大过处分；给予打人凶手汤山林劳动教养１年的处分。
