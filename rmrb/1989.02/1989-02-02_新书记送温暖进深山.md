New Secretary Brings Warmth to the Mountains

By Zhang Zhen Guo

Time: January 28, 1989. The sky was clear, but the ground was frozen. Location: Huangling Village, Ganshan Township, Nanling County, Anhui Province. This place is inaccessible by car. Mountains surround the village. There is no primary school, nor is there a small shop. The entire village has 140 people, with less than half an acre of land per person. During the revolutionary war years, the people here risked their lives to shelter many New Fourth Army officials. However, in the past 40 years, they have been waiting day and night, but no county-level cadre has come to the village to have a heart-to-heart talk. An old farmer once asked someone to convey a message to the county committee, municipal committee, and provincial committee: "I hope those who have eaten our food and drunk our tea and are now high-ranking officials will not be too concerned about their own legs and take the time to come and see the mountain people..."

Incumbents for just over a year in Nanling, the 41-year-old Huiguosheng, a member of the Wuhu Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and Secretary of the Nanling County Committee, is the son of an old cadre. In recent years, he has visited all five districts and 27 townships in the county, but he has not yet had the chance to visit this poor mountain valley. When he heard the old farmer's words, he felt uneasy. He said, "Lenin's words are right, forgetting the past means betrayal..."

That morning, after breakfast, the reporter accompanied Secretary Hui to the township government. The township Party Committee Secretary, Xianxingfu, was very happy to accompany us to Huangling Village. When we climbed over the mountains and arrived at the village, we saw a few village girls breaking the thick ice on the pond to wash clothes, while the other men and women laborers had gone up the mountain to chop firewood. Secretary Hui calculated that there were only 7 days left until the Lunar New Year, and the people were still on the mountain chopping firewood, showing no signs of celebrating the New Year. He suddenly felt a pang of heartache.

"Nanling's highest official has come!" Who knows who spread this news. In an instant, people rushed from the mountains, fields, and ponds to the secretary's side: "You are the first high-ranking official to come in 40 years!" "We mountain people are used to hardship, and we won't hesitate to do difficult things, we just hope you won't forget us!" "Damn the Great Leap Forward, the Communist Wind, which cut down all the big trees in front of and behind our village; and without caring about our lives, built a big dam at the bottom of the village, not only flooding our fertile fields above, but also blocking the only road we have to the city!" "Adults can still climb out of the mountains, but children climbing mountains to go to school really makes us worried!" ...

We entered a household. The people busily opened the tea container and brewed us a cup of osmanthus tea. They also feared we might be cold and asked us to put our legs into the warm fire pot. Secretary Hui seemed to have a lot to say, but he did not make many promises on the spot. He was very excited and wrote two notes, one suggesting that the county immediately allocate 2,500 kilograms of relief grain, which must be implemented before the festival; the other suggesting that the county immediately allocate 2 tons of diesel to solve the urgent need for spring plowing. He also said, "In a few days, I will coordinate with relevant departments to study and solve your problems. To get rich, you need a path, how can you get rich without one!"

The mountain people do not have the habit of applauding, but they nodded one by one and said, "That would be great, thank you so much!"

As we were about to climb back over the mountain to the city, a group of young people suddenly rushed over and asked the secretary if he had any name cards. Secretary Hui immediately patted his pocket and said, "I have!" The young men took the secretary's name card and said, "If we encounter difficulties in the future, we will go to you!" An old farmer hurriedly said, "You can go for big things, but don't bother the secretary with small things!" Secretary Hui humorously blurted out, "I am a small official, how can I not handle small things?!"

Before leaving, Secretary Hui specially paid his respects to the old farmer Xia Zicheng, who had sent the message and was now 83 years old. The old man was deaf and could not hear, so people used gestures to tell him that the county committee secretary had come to pay his New Year's respects and wish him a long life. The old man held Secretary Hui's hand with both hands and almost pressed his face to the secretary's face, looking left and right, and said excitedly, "It's good that you came, it's good that you came, it's still the young people who are good! They have the energy to climb over the mountain..."

The villagers sent us off again and again, all the way to the top of the mountain, still looking far away...

　　新书记送温暖进深山
    本报记者  张振国
    时间：１９８９年１月２８日。天晴，但冰封大地。地点：安徽省南陵县工山乡山峰村黄岭自然村。这里不通汽车。环村皆山。没有小学，也无小店。全村１４０多人，人均不到半亩田。在革命战争年代，这里的人民，曾冒着生命的危险，掩护过很多新四军要员。但４０年来，他们日盼夜盼，没有盼到过一位县级干部到村上来谈谈心。一位老农曾托人给县委、市委、省委捎过口信：“希望那些吃过我们的饭，喝过我们的茶，如今当了大官的人，别太爱惜自己的腿，也能抽空来看看山里人……”
    刚到南陵只有１年多时间的中共芜湖市委常委、南陵县委书记惠国胜，现年４１岁，是一位老干部的儿子。近年来，他已跑过了全县５个区、２７个乡镇，但这穷山沟里他还未来得及跑。当他听到那位老农语重心长的话，深感不安。他说：“列宁的话很对，忘记过去，就意味着背叛……”
    这天早饭后，记者陪同惠书记到了乡政府。乡党委书记项兴甫非常高兴地和我们结伴前往黄岭村。当我们翻山越岭跑到村边，只见几位村姑敲开塘边的厚冰在洗衣裳，其他男女劳力都上山砍柴去了。惠书记掐指一算，现在离大年三十只有７天了，人们还在山上打柴，毫无过年的迹象，他顿时感到一阵心酸。
    “南陵县最大的官来了！”也不知是谁传出了这个信息。转眼之间，人们从山上、田头、塘边飞奔到书记身边：“你是４０年间来的第一个大官呀！”“我们山里人苦惯了，畏难的事不会畏难你办，只是盼你们别忘了我们！”“该死的大跃进，刮共产风，把我们村前村后的大树全砍光了；又不顾我们死活，在村底下打了一个大坝，淹了我们上面的良田不说，还堵死了我们进城的一条独路！”“大人出山还能爬得动，小孩翻山上学，真叫我们不放心！”……人们七嘴八舌掏出的全是心里话。
    我们走进了一户人家。人们忙着打开茶筒，为我们泡上一碗桂花茶。他们还生怕我们冻着，要我们把腿伸进文火桶。惠书记似乎有很多话要说，但他没有当面多许愿。只是十分激动地写了两张条子，一张是建议县里立即拨给２５００公斤救济粮，一定要在节前落实；一张是建议县里马上调给柴油２吨，以解决春耕的急需。另外还说了一句话：“过些日子，我将会同有关部门来研究解决你们的出路，要想富，没有路，怎得富！”山里人没有鼓掌的习惯，只是一个个点头说：“那就太好了，太费心了！”
    在我们快要翻山回城时，忽然拥来一群小青年，问书记有没有名片。惠书记立即掏掏荷包，说：“有！”小伙子们接过书记的名片说：“以后遇到困难我们就去找你！”一位老农赶忙说：“有大事可以去找，芝麻大的事可不要去麻烦书记！”惠书记很有风趣地脱口而出“我是芝麻官，不管芝麻事怎么行？！”
    临行前，惠书记特地拜望了那位曾捎过口信、现已年高８３岁的老农夏自成。他耳聋听不见，人们就打着手势告诉他，说：“县委书记来向你拜早年，祝你长寿！”老人双手捧着小惠的手，几乎把脸都贴到书记的脸上，左一看，右一看，并很激动地说：“来了就好，来了就好，还是年轻人好！有劲，能爬过山来……”
    山民们送了一程又一程，一直送过山头，还在翘首远望……
