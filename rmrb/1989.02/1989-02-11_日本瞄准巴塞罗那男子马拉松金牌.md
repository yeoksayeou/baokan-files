Japan is a powerhouse in men's marathon running, boasting three athletes who have broken the 2-hour 8-minute barrier, a depth of talent unmatched by any other country.

However, in the Seoul and Los Angeles Olympics, Japanese runners failed to make it to the podium, with their best finish being fourth place. Although Japanese athletes have won numerous other major races, the Olympics remain the ultimate test. After the Seoul Olympics, the Japan Athletics Association began studying how to capture the gold medal in the 1992 Barcelona Olympics.

Currently, among Japan's top marathon runners, the brothers So Mo and So Beng, as well as Sekiya Toshihiko, have all retired. While Asia's record holder, Kojima Taisho, has shown some improvement, he is already past his prime at over 30 years old. Along with 34-year-old Ito Kunimitsu, it seems unlikely that they will have much to offer.

Japan's hopes now rest on Nakayama Chikayoshi, who finished fourth in the Seoul Olympics, and Taniguchi Kazuo, who ran an impressive 2:07:40 in Beijing last year. However, both are already 29 years old, and in three years' time, their age will not be ideal.

Therefore, the Japan Athletics Association is eager to see the emergence of younger talent. While a new generation of runners has shown promising results, they lack the competitive experience necessary for success. Marathon racing is more about finishing position than personal bests. From last year's Fukuoka Marathon, it is clear that these young runners are not yet ready. How to quickly develop more experienced runners to form a stronger team for Barcelona has become a critical issue for Japan's sports community.

### 日本瞄准巴塞罗那男子马拉松金牌

　　日本瞄准巴塞罗那男子马拉松金牌
    日本是男子马拉松的强国，突破２小时８分大关的好手就有三人之多，其基础之厚实超过任何国家。
    但是，在汉城和洛杉矶奥运会上，日本选手都未能走上领奖台，最好名次都只是第四名。尽管日本好手在其他大赛上多次夺冠，但奥运会毕竟是最重要的比赛。汉城奥运会结束后，日本田联就开始研究如何夺取１９９２年巴塞罗那奥运会的马拉松金牌。
    目前日本的马拉松好手中，宗茂、宗猛兄弟和濑谷利彦等人先后告退。亚洲最好成绩保持者儿玉泰介虽然状况有所恢复，但已过而立之年，他和３４岁的伊藤国光，看来都不可能有太大的指望。日本方面将希望寄托在汉城奥运会第四名的中山竹通以及去年在北京跑出２小时７分４０秒优异成绩的谷口浩美身上。不过，他俩亦已２９岁，三年多以后，他们的年龄也不那么理想了。
    因此，日本田联迫切希望出现更年轻的好手。现在的一大批新手成绩虽然可以，但比赛经验明显缺乏。马拉松比赛更重要的是名次而不是成绩。从去年年底的福冈马拉松赛来看，这些新手显然还不够成熟。如何尽快使更多的新手接上茬，以便推出更强的阵容出征巴塞罗那，已成了日本体育界的一个重要课题。
