In temples, there is usually a wooden box in front of the Buddha statue, where devotees can "donate as they wish." For the money-collecting deity, this is a way to gather funds; for those who donate, it is a way to pray for blessings and ward off disasters. This is understandable.

There is another situation, which often occurs in temples and pagodas, using a combination of superstition and gambling to lure tourists into throwing money. For example, whoever can throw a coin into a metal plate in a pool or a cave in a rock will have good luck. This is also a way to collect money, and for the tourists who throw coins, it is like paying money to get a fortune told. This is also understandable.

However, another similar behavior is hard to understand. In the Three Ponds of Moon Reflection Island in West Lake, Hangzhou, the water surface is covered with lotus leaves, and the scent of lotus flowers fills the air. I noticed that many lotus leaves have several coins on them, and even more are at the bottom of the water, shining silver in the mud. Many young people, upon seeing this, are inspired to join in, throwing coins for fun, some even competing and betting. Amidst the laughter, thousands of coins sink into the mud. I think these coins with the national emblem printed on them will probably never be retrieved.

Those who throw coins are not necessarily all wealthy; there are many ways to have fun, so why specifically use valuable coins for amusement? Casually throwing coins for fun is like using a ten-yuan bill to wallpaper a wall—it actually contains a sense of self-deprecation and mockery. The coins with the shining national emblem and one's own amusement sink together into the mud. But I wonder, how can we save that lost rationality?

### 陷落于泥淖的硬币

　　陷落于泥淖的硬币
    在寺庙里，菩萨座前总有个木柜，让善男信女“随缘乐助”，丢些钱进去。对收财的神来说，是一种敛钱的办法；在施钱的人来说，是为了祈福消灾。这能理解。
    还有种情况，也大多发生于寺庙观塔，用一种迷信加赌彩的办法，诱引游客丢钱。例如，谁能把钱币投进池中的铁盘中、山石洞中，谁就可以得到好运。这也是敛钱的办法，在投钱的游客来说，等于花钱占了一卦。这也能理解。
    而另一类似的行为，却难理解。杭州西湖三潭印月岛中，水面上荷叶田田，荷香流溢。我发现，许多荷叶上都落有不少镍币，更多的落在水底，泥淖之中一片银光闪闪。不少青年看见了，也勾起雅兴，纷纷投掷取乐，有的还比赛、打赌。一片哗笑声中，千百硬币陷入污泥。我想，这些印着国徽的通货，大概从此是历劫不返了。
    掷钱的人固然未必都是暴发户；取乐的办法多种多样，为什么偏拿有价值的硬币来开心？随便抛掷取乐和用十元票来裱糊墙壁一样，其实是包含着对自己的蔑视和嘲弄，戴着光辉国徽的货币和自己的趣味，一道陷落在泥淖之中。但我想，怎么拯救那丢失的理性呢？
