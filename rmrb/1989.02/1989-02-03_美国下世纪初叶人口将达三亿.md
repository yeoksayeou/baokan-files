The U.S. Census Bureau released a report on January 31 predicting the population trends for the United States in the 21st century. The current population of the United States is 246 million. It is estimated that by the year 2038, the population will rise to 302 million, an increase of 25 percent from the current level. After that, the population is expected to gradually decline, reaching 292 million by the year 2080.

This is the first time the U.S. Census Bureau has issued a population trend report. The report also predicts that the proportion of whites in the U.S. population may begin to decline over the next 40 years. In 1987, whites made up 76 percent of the total population. It is estimated that by the year 2040, this figure will drop to 62 percent. During the same period, the proportion of blacks in the total population is expected to rise from 12 percent to 15 percent, while the proportion of Asian-Pacific Islanders and Native Americans is expected to increase from 3 percent to 8 percent.

　　美国下世纪初叶人口将达三亿
    本报华盛顿二月一日电  美国国情普查局一月三十一日发表报告，对二十一世纪美国人口的增减趋势进行预测。美国人口现为二点四六亿，预计到二○三八年将上升到三点零二亿，即比目前增加百分之二十五。随后，美国人口将逐渐下降，到二○八○年降至二点九二亿。
    美国国情普查局是第一次发表人口趋势报告。报告还预测，美国人口中的白人所占的比例，在今后四十年里可能开始下降。一九八七年，白人占总人口的百分之七十六，预计到二○四○年将下降到百分之六十二，而同时期黑人占总人口的比例将从百分之十二上升到百分之十五，亚太族裔和印第安人占总人口的比例也将从百分之三升至百分之八。
