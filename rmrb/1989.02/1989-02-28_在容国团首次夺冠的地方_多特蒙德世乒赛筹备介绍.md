In the history of Chinese table tennis, the first world champion was Rong Guantang, who won the title in 1959 in Dortmund, West Germany. Exactly 30 years later, the 40th World Table Tennis Championships will be held in the same place. This will be the third time West Germany has hosted the World Table Tennis Championships, following the 1959 event in Dortmund and the 1969 event in Munich. It is estimated that this tournament will attract 700-plus athletes from 79 table tennis associations, along with 700-plus coaches and staff, 200 referees, and 600 journalists. The number of participants will surpass the record set at the 1985 Gothenburg, Sweden tournament (68 associations), making it the largest World Table Tennis Championships in its 63-year history. West German President Richard von Weizsäcker will serve as the patron of this tournament, and International Olympic Committee President Juan Antonio Samaranch will attend the opening ceremony. Samaranch is an amateur table tennis enthusiast, and the inclusion of table tennis in the 1988 Seoul Olympics is largely due to his efforts.

Among the 79 participating associations, the United Kingdom alone accounts for six: in addition to England, Scotland, and Wales, there are also Guernsey, Jersey, and the Isle of Man, which can be confusing. Guernsey and Jersey are two small islands in the English Channel, under British sovereignty but closer to France, where French is more commonly spoken. Both islands are popular tourist destinations and famous "tax havens." The Isle of Man is located in the Irish Sea off the coast of the United Kingdom and is also a tourist destination, where some old customs, such as flogging for certain crimes, are still practiced. These three islands have traditionally had independent sports activities and thus participate in the World Table Tennis Championships as separate teams.

The Irish team also includes British players. In table tennis, rowing, boxing, and rugby, international competitions have seen Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland combine to form a single team. Some Northern Irish athletes compete in the Olympics representing the Republic of Ireland, while in the Commonwealth Games, they represent Northern Ireland. Therefore, some say that the United Kingdom has sent seven teams to this World Table Tennis Championships.

In contrast, among the 36 European table tennis associations, East Germany is the only one absent. Since the 1969 Munich World Table Tennis Championships, the East German team has not appeared. Experts estimate that with table tennis being included in the Olympics, the East German team will return to the World Table Tennis Championships, but it will take at least 10 years for them to catch up to the world's advanced level.

Among the 79 associations, 17 have sent only men's teams, 3 have sent only women's teams, and 4 have sent participants only for singles events. Trinidad and Tobago, as well as Tanzania, registered too late and will not be able to participate in the team draw, likely only participating in individual events.

　　在容国团首次夺冠的地方
    ——多特蒙德世乒赛筹备介绍
    中国乒乓球运动史上的第一个世界冠军，是容国团１９５９年在西德的多特蒙德获得的。整整３０年后，第４０届世乒赛又将在这里举行。这是西德继１９５９年（多特蒙德）、１９６９年（慕尼黑）之后，第三次举办世乒赛。据粗略估计，这次大赛将有７９个乒协的７００多名运动员，７００多名教练和工作人员，２００名裁判和６００名记者到场。人数之多打破１９８５年瑞典哥德堡大赛的纪录（６８个乒协），是世乒赛６３年历史上规模最大的一次盛会。西德总统魏茨泽克担任本届大赛的“保护人”，国际奥委会主席萨马兰奇将亲临开幕式。他本人是一位业余乒乓球爱好者，乒乓球能跻身去年汉城奥运会，很大程度上要归功于他。
    ７９个参赛的乒协中，英国一家就占了６个：除英格兰、苏格兰和威尔士之外，格恩泽、泽西和马恩把大家都弄糊涂了。原来，格恩泽和泽西是英吉利海峡中两个小岛，主权属英国，可离法国更近，法语也更通行。两岛都是旅游胜地和有名的“低税天堂”。马恩岛位于英国的爱尔兰湾，也是旅游胜地，岛上至今保留着对某些罪行实行鞭笞的旧俗。三个岛屿体育活动历来独立，因此参加世乒赛也单独组队。
    爱尔兰队里也有英国人，原来在乒乓球、划艇、拳击和橄榄球几项运动中，国际比赛时北爱尔兰和爱尔兰联合组队参加国际比赛。有的北爱尔兰运动员在奥运会上代表爱尔兰，到了英联邦运动会又代表北爱尔兰。因此有人也说，英国向本届世乒赛派了７个队。
    与此形成对照的是，３６个欧洲乒协中民主德国是唯一缺席的队。自１９６９年慕尼黑世乒赛以来，民主德国队再没露过面。专家们估计，随着乒乓球列入奥运会，民主德国队会重返世乒赛，但追上世界先进水平恐怕至少要１０年。
    ７９个乒协中，１７个只派男队，３个只派了女队，４个只派人参加单打，特立尼达和多巴哥以及坦桑尼亚报名过晚，未能参加团体赛抽签，恐怕只能参加单项比赛了。　　　　　　　　　（上）
