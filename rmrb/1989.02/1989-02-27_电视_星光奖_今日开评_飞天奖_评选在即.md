The vice chairman and secretary-general of the China Television Art Committee, Ruan Ruolin, recently informed a reporter that the evaluation of the third National Television Art "Star Award" and the selection of the ninth "Flying Sky Award" for television dramas will commence on February 27 and March 21, respectively. For this purpose, the Television Art Committee recently held a meeting in Beijing to reorganize the judges for both awards, with a group of experts and theorists from the art and criticism fields joining the new selection team.

To promote the development of television art, improve program quality, and foster the television art team, the China Television Art Committee, starting from the previous session, changed the "Star Award" for television art, originally organized by the Art Department of CCTV, into the highest national award for television art programs, organized and evaluated by the committee. This year's selection committee has changed from the previous two sessions, where all members were from the television industry, to include experts from the music, dance, and drama fields, such as Shi Le Meng, Chen Gong, and Jin Tie Lin, who will participate in the selection of this year's "Star Award."

Like the "Flying Sky Award," the "Star Award" is also selected annually. From March 1, 1988, to February 28, 1989, all art programs broadcast on various art columns of CCTV, including those produced by central and local television stations and social organizations, will compete in this year's "Star Award."

The selection committee for the National Television Drama "Flying Sky Award" has also been reorganized to break the "lifetime" system, with some old judges retiring from the ninth "Flying Sky Award" selection team and being replaced by a group of film and television critics and theorists.

Ruan Ruolin also revealed to the reporter that to guide the healthy development of domestic video tapes, the Television Art Committee will, on behalf of the government, conduct the first evaluation and award ceremony for video tapes produced and released by various audio-visual publishing units across the country in the second half of this year.

　　电视“星光奖”今日开评  “飞天奖”评选在即
    本报讯  记者向兵报道：中国电视艺术委员会副主任兼秘书长阮若琳日前告诉记者，第三届全国电视文艺“星光奖”和第９届电视剧“飞天奖”的评选工作，将分别于２月２７日和３月２１日开始。为此，电视艺委会最近在北京召开会议，对两个奖的评委进行了改组，一批艺术界的专家和理论、评论工作者进入新的评选班子。
    为了繁荣电视文艺创作，提高节目质量，促进电视文艺队伍的建设，中国电视艺术委员会从上届开始，将原由中央电视台文艺部举办的电视文艺“星光奖”，改为由艺委会代表政府设立的全国电视文艺节目最高奖。由艺委会组织专家评选产生。本届评选委员会，改变前两届全由清一色的电视界人士组成的格局，一批音乐、舞蹈、戏剧界的专家，如时乐濛、晨耕、金铁林等，将参加本届“星光奖”的评选。
    和“飞天奖”一样，“星光奖”也是每年评选一次。从去年３月１日到今年２月２８日，凡是在中央电视台各个文艺栏目中播出的中央和各地方电视台，及社会团体摄制的文艺节目，都将参加本届“星光奖”的角逐。
    全国电视剧“飞天奖”评选委员会也在打破“终身制”的基础上进行改组，一些老评委将退出第９届“飞天奖”评选班子，由一批影视评论家和理论工作者代替。
    阮若琳还向记者透露，为引导国产录像片健康发展，电视艺委会将代表政府，于今年下半年对全国各家音像出版单位摄制发行的录像片，进行首次评奖。
