	What a tranquil forest, with green hills stretching endlessly and lush trees. The autumn breeze gently blows, rustling the leaves. This is the scenic area of Zhenjiang's southern suburbs, renowned for its seclusion.

	A winding path leads into a bamboo grove, and among the verdant trees stands an ancient, rustic gray wall: "Zhulin Chan Temple." Deeper within the green foliage, a tall stone archway stands prominently, with couplets on it telling us this is the Shaoyin Temple. These two temples, along with another ancient temple, Helin Temple, embody the charm of the southern suburbs: cranes flying, bamboo surrounding, and seclusion.

	These three temples were all built during the Eastern Jin Dynasty. In ancient times, they were extremely famous, but after numerous wars and disturbances, they were repeatedly destroyed and rebuilt. The magnificent halls no longer exist, but they retain an ancient charm, adding a unique elegance.

	The three ancient temples are accompanied by three ancient figures and their sites: the Reading Platform of Prince Zhoming, the Listening to Orioles Pavilion of Zaiyong, and the tomb of Mi Fu.

	Above the old site of the Shaoyin Temple, on the mountain slope, there is a delicate courtyard with white walls. Facing it is an ancient house with three bays. Prince Zhoming once studied here. This young prince moved the imperial library's ten thousand volumes of books to the deep mountains, reading them for several years. He also invited scholars and literati to gather at the Reading Platform next to the Zenghua Pavilion, discussing poetry and literature, evaluating and recommending each other, acting as the "chief editor" to compile the famous "Wenxuan," which is renowned in Chinese literary history.

	Mi Fu, a calligrapher and painter of the Song Dynasty, loved the wild scenery and misty clouds of the southern suburbs. Besides writing poems to praise them, he also learned from nature, using ink and brush to create his own style, establishing the "Mi Family Cloud Mountains." Even after his death, he chose to be buried beside the Helin Temple, becoming part of the ancient temple.

	Not only did literary figures and painters enjoy the mountains for reading and painting, but musicians also loved the mountains. During the Eastern Jin Dynasty, the musician Zaiyong spent his life without seeking official positions, living in seclusion in the mountains. Every day, he sat alone under the green shade, listening to the melodious and clear songs of the orioles, creating timeless works such as "You Xian," "Guangling," and "Zhi Xi." After his death, he donated his bamboo house with over three hundred rooms to the Buddhist temple.

	The path is winding, the road is sloping, and the forest is dense. We ascend to the highest pavilion in the southern suburbs, the Bird-Outside Pavilion. This pavilion is like a large bird with wings spread, soaring above the green sea and blue waves, facing the autumn wind and gazing into the distance. The green mountains stretch endlessly, ancient temples and pavilions are faintly visible, and the vast river seems like a belt.

	When the car returns to the bustling city, we feel even more the tranquility of the southern suburbs. Indeed, music cannot do without rests, and the fast-paced modern life needs to be adjusted with tranquility and seclusion from time to time!

　　镇江南郊漫步
    陆潮洪
    好一片寂静的山林，青峦连绵，绿树葱郁，秋风徐来，林间飒飒。这里便是以幽绝著称的镇江南郊风景区。
    曲径伸去，竹林闪处，绿树掩映着一道古朴的青灰墙：“竹林禅寺”。而翠绿丛中的深处，又有一座高大的石坊赫然而立，坊上的联句，告诉我们这是招隐寺。这二寺连同另一座古刹鹤林寺，让人感受出南郊山林的妙趣：鹤飞、竹拥、招隐。
    此三刹均建于东晋，古时，极负盛名，后屡经战火、动乱，屡建屡毁，雄伟的殿堂不复存在。却留下古旧的韵味，添一种独有的文雅。
    三座古刹伴随着三个古代名人及遗址：昭明太子读书台、哉颙听鹂山房、米芾墓。
    招隐寺旧址向上的山腰，有一精致粉墙庭院，迎面三开明间的古舍。昭明太子曾在此攻读。这位年轻的皇太子，移宫中藏书万卷，居深山披阅数载，还引纳学士墨客云集读书台旁的增华阁，议论诗文，评品互荐，自做“总编辑”，编成名垂中国文学史的《文选》。
    米芾，宋代书画家，酷爱南郊山林野趣，云烟雾霭。除写诗赞颂外，还师法自然，泼墨挥毫，自成一家，创立“米氏云山”，连死后也要归葬鹤林寺侧，作古寺的伽蓝。
    不仅文学家、书画家喜好出没山林攻读，作画，音乐家也爱山林。东晋时的音乐家哉颙，一生仕禄不求，隐居山中。他每天独坐绿荫，静聆婉转清脆的黄鹂歌喉，创作出《游弦》、《广陵》、《止息》等传世之作。死后，将竹林精舍三百余间施舍佛门为寺。
    径曲路斜林密。我们直上南郊诸亭中最高的鸟外亭。这亭，如一只振翅的大鸟凌空于绿海碧波之上，迎着秋风远眺，青山逶迤，古刹亭台隐约，大江浩渺，似练似带。
    当车又驶回都市尘嚣时，我们更觉得南郊山林的幽静。的确，乐曲离不了休止符，快节奏的现代生活多么需要不时用宁静、幽邃来调适！
