    Investigation Notes:
    Recently, a reporter visited the Beijing Library, and relevant officials explained the reason for charging a deposit for issuing library cards.

    The Beijing Library is China's national library, and the books and publications it holds are intended to serve the entire country. The Beijing Library has a wide variety of books, but few duplicates, so its service policy is to primarily ensure that books are read within the library and not lent out in large quantities. Similarly, in most countries around the world, national libraries generally restrict books to being read within the library and do not lend them out. Currently, the Beijing Library has opened more than 30 reading rooms with over 3,000 seats, accommodating seven to eight thousand readers daily. At present, the Beijing Library has nearly one million new books and periodicals available for open-shelf reading, allowing readers to read them upon arrival. Additionally, the Beijing Library provides readers with convenient means to copy materials.

    The Beijing Library's service of lending books to the public is conducted under the premise of ensuring that books are primarily read within the library. The issuance of library cards, the number of books that can be borrowed, and the range of books that can be borrowed are all subject to certain restrictions. Currently, the Beijing Library has issued over 40,000 library cards, a number that has reached the library's comprehensive capacity in terms of its collection, facilities, and staff. The Beijing Library's services for reading books and publications and lending them out are both free of charge. However, in the process of lending books, some readers do not take good care of the books and do not return them on time, causing damage to state property and seriously affecting the normal circulation of books. Therefore, the Beijing Library decided to start charging a deposit for library cards this year. A foreign language library card requires a deposit of 100 yuan, and a Chinese language library card requires a deposit of 20 yuan. The deposit will be refunded upon the return of the card. The advantages of this approach are as follows: First, it ensures that the limited number of library cards are issued to those who truly need them, thereby improving the actual usage rate of the library cards. Taking foreign language library cards as an example, the issuance is limited to individuals with senior professional titles and equivalent administrative positions. It is understood that Beijing alone has over 200,000 senior professional and technical personnel, such as associate professors, associate researchers, and senior engineers, as well as government and military officials at the bureau level and above. However, the Beijing Library can issue at most 20,000 library cards to individuals. By charging a deposit and implementing some restrictions, those who do not need to borrow books frequently can be deterred. Second, it strengthens management and protects books. Currently, many units are undergoing significant changes, and personnel are moving frequently. The Beijing Library issues library cards nationwide, and without some economic measures, it is difficult to manage. Charging a deposit can ensure that borrowers return books promptly when they leave their jobs, and it can also prevent the damage and late return of books. Third, it limits the issuance of library cards through backdoor channels to some extent.

    The responsible person from the Business Department of the Beijing Library also told the reporter: Currently, the vast majority of readers support the practice of charging a deposit for library cards. Of course, a few units and individuals have not re-applied for new library cards, and these units and individuals basically do not need to borrow books frequently. Most readers hope that the Beijing Library will increase the number of library cards issued, but currently, the Beijing Library is unable to meet this demand.

    调查附记:
    最近，记者走访了北京图书馆，有关负责同志对发放借书证为何要收取押金一事作了说明。
    北京图书馆是我国的国家图书馆，馆内所藏的书刊资料是面向全国服务的。北京图书馆的藏书品种多，但复本少，因此它的服务方针是以保证馆内阅读为主，图书不可能大量外借。世界上大多数国家图书馆的图书一般也限于在馆内阅读，并不外借。目前，北京图书馆已开设了３０多个阅览室，阅览座位有３０００多个，日接待读者七八千人次。眼下，北京图书馆已有近百万册新书、报刊提供开架阅读，读者只要前去，即可阅读。同时，北京图书馆还为读者提供了较方便的复制资料的手段。
    北京图书馆对外出借图书的业务，只是在保证馆内阅读的前提下开展的一项服务业务。借书证的发放范围、数量和借书范围都有一定限制。当前，北京图书馆发出各种借书证４万多个，这个数字已达到北京图书馆目前藏书、设备、人员等方面的综合承受能力。北京图书馆的书刊资料阅读和外借服务都是无偿的，但在外借图书服务中，有些读者不爱护图书，不按期归还所借的图书，致使国家财产蒙受损失，并严重影响图书的正常流通。为此，北京图书馆决定从今年开始收取一定数量的借书押金，一张外文借书证收１００元押金，一张中文图书借书卡收２０元押金，所收的押金于退证时归还。这样做的好处是：一、把有限的借书证发给那些真正需要的读者，以便提高借书证的实际使用率。以外文借书证为例，发放范围限于有高级专业技术职称和相当行政职务的人。据了解，北京地区的副教授、副研究员、高级工程师以上的高级专业技术人员和政府部门、军队中的司局级、师级以上干部已超过２０万人，而现在北京图书馆充其量只能向个人发放２万个借书证，收一点押金和适当采取一些限制措施，就可以挡一挡那些不需要经常借书的人。二、加强管理，保护图书。现在，一些单位变化很大，人员流动也很快。北京图书馆借书证的发放范围是面向全国的，不采取一些经济手段很难管理。收一点押金，可以使借书人调离工作单位时及时交还图书，同时还可以防止图书损坏和不按期归还图书的现象发生。三、在一定程度上限制了后门借书证。
    北京图书馆业务处的负责同志还告诉记者：目前，绝大多数读者对办理借书证收取押金的做法是赞同的。当然，有少数单位和个人没有重新办新借书证，这些单位和个人基本上是属于不需要经常借书的。多数读者希望北京图书馆增加发证数量，而目前北京图书馆难于满足这一要求。
