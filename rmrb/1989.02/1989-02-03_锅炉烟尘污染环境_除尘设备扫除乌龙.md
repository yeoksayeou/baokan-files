Boiler dust pollution and the mistakes of dust removal equipment

	This newspaper reports: In Harbin City, the Industrial Dust Removal Equipment Factory's 70-year-old senior technician Li Yinzhang has domestically pioneered the development of a stirring-type smoke removal and dust removal device, solving the problem of black smoke pollution from numerous large and medium-sized boilers in China.

	Currently, most industrial and mining enterprises in China use large and medium-sized coal-fired boilers. When these boilers burn coal, they produce thick smoke, and the dust emission concentration exceeds environmental protection standards by more than ten times, becoming a significant public hazard. Over the years, various regions have tried to manufacture multiple types of smoke removal and dust removal devices, but the results have not been ideal. Li Yinzhang's newly developed series of smoke removal and dust removal products can be installed on 6.5-ton to 35-ton coal-fired boilers. The dust removal efficiency of this device reaches 97% or higher, which is 6% higher than the best dust removal efficiency currently available in China. The dust emission concentration is reduced to 204 milligrams per cubic meter, approaching the international standard of 200 milligrams per cubic meter, which is only 1/20 of the concentration before dust removal. When the boiler operates at full load, almost no black smoke is visible.

　　锅炉烟尘污染环境  除尘设备扫除乌龙
    本报讯  哈尔滨市实业除尘设备厂年过七旬的老技师李荫樟，在国内首创搅拌式消烟除尘器，解决了我国众多大中型锅炉黑烟污染环境的难题。
    目前，我国多数工矿企业使用的是大中型抛煤机锅炉，燃烧时浓烟滚滚，烟尘排放浓度超过环保标准十几倍，成为一大公害。多年来，各地试制多种消烟除尘装置效果，都不甚理想。李荫樟研制的这种新型消烟除尘系列产品，可以安装在６．５吨到３５吨抛煤机锅炉上。其除尘率高达９７％以上，比目前国内除尘效果最好的还高６％；烟尘排放浓度降低到每立方米２０４毫克，接近每立方米２００毫克的国际标准，只有除尘前的１／２０；锅炉满负荷运行时基本看不到黑烟。
