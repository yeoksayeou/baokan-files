The Khanty people, who reside in the middle and lower reaches of the Ob River in western Siberia, are an ancient ethnic minority in the Soviet Union. Recently, a group of Khanty residents wrote to the Soviet Union's Supreme Soviet's Council of Nationalities, requesting that the government take measures to save this small ethnic group and leave them some space to survive.

The problems raised by these Khanty people are not exaggerated; their concerns are justified.

Before the 1960s, the Khanty people lived in their traditional way: hunting, fishing, rearing reindeer, raising livestock, and cultivating potatoes and vegetables. Although their lives were not particularly affluent, they were content and lived in peace.

However, with the development of the Tyumen oil fields, the peaceful life of the Khanty people was disrupted. A large oil exploration force arrived. They cut down trees, built roads, and turned the once-peaceful Khanty homeland into a place with constant traffic and the roar of machinery day and night. They erected tall drilling rigs, turning the vast grasslands where the Khanty people once reared reindeer and grazed cattle into oil fields. Over time, even the surface of small rivers was covered with a layer of black oil, making it impossible for fish to survive. In some areas, oil fields surrounded the Khanty people on all sides, forcing them to relocate their entire families, with many having to live in tents year-round. Their reindeer were frequently attacked by wild dogs, resulting in heavy losses.

The younger generation of Khanty people, due to objective conditions, did not have the opportunity to learn the traditional skills of their elders. They neither know how to hunt nor fish, let alone rear reindeer. Many of them do not even speak their native language. The population of the Khanty people is also gradually decreasing, with only about 20,000 remaining.

In recent years, with the deepening of reforms and the widespread promotion of "openness" and democratization, the Khanty people have been inspired and gained courage. It is under such circumstances that over 100 fishermen and hunters from Surgut in the Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug jointly wrote a letter to the Soviet Union's Supreme Soviet's Council of Nationalities.

In early this year, Yeleme Aipin, a Khanty writer and a member of the Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, wrote in *Moscow News* that restoring the land and rivers destroyed by oil fields over the past 30 years would require 43 billion rubles. However, human lives are more important than oil. He believes that the urgent task now is to preserve the land that has not yet been damaged. He suggests establishing a northern ethnic protection zone and prohibiting industrial enterprises from occupying the land in the protection zone.

　　一个古老民族的担心和希望
    聚居在西伯利亚西部鄂毕河中下游地区的汉特人，是苏联一个古老的少数民族。不久前，一批汉特族居民上书苏联最高苏维埃民族院，要求政府采取措施，救救这个小民族，给他们留下一块生存的空间。
    这些汉特人提出的问题并非危言耸听，他们的担心是有根据的。
    ６０年代以前，汉特人一直以自己的传统方式生活着：狩猎、捕鱼、驯养家鹿、饲养家畜、种植土豆、蔬菜。他们的生活虽不十分富裕，倒也安居乐业。
    但是，随着秋明油田的开发，汉特人的安宁生活被打破了。一支石油大军来到这里。他们砍倒树木，修筑公路，使一向宁静的汉特之乡汽车往来不绝，机器日夜轰鸣；他们竖起了一座座高大的钻井架，把昔日汉特人驯养家鹿、牧放牛马的大片草地变成了油田。久而久之，就连小河的水面上也漂浮着一层黑色的石油，使鱼类无法在河里存身。在一些地区，油田从四面将汉特人包围，迫使他们不得不举家迁往别处，许多人只好一年四季住在帐篷里，他们养的鹿不断受到野狗的袭击，损失惨重。
    年轻一代汉特人由于客观条件的限制，没有机会从老一辈那里学会汉特人的祖传本领，既不会打猎，也不会捕鱼，更不会驯鹿。许多人甚至连自己的民族语言都不会说了。汉特民族的人数也正在逐渐减少，目前只剩下二万多人。
    近年来，随着改革的逐渐深入，“公开性”和民主化的广泛推行，汉特人受到了鼓舞，增添了勇气。正是在这样的情况下，汉特—曼西斯克自治专区苏尔古特的１００多位渔民和猎人联名给苏联最高苏维埃民族院写了信。
    苏共汉特—曼西斯克自治专区委员会常委、汉特族作家叶列梅·艾平今年年初在《莫斯科新闻》上撰文指出，恢复近３０年来被油田破坏的土地和河流需耗资４３０亿卢布，但是，人的命运毕竟比石油更重要。他认为，现在的当务之急是，首先要保住尚未受到损害的土地。他建议设立北方民族保护区，禁止工业企业侵占保护区的土地。
