Some cadres are often labeled as "controversial cadres" if they are reported, criticized for minor issues, or become the subject of rumors. This label can affect their promotions and usage. Some people advocate for boldly promoting controversial cadres, which is commendable. However, upon closer examination, the key issue is not just about daring to promote them boldly. Instead, we need to study the concept of "controversial" and how to define "controversial cadres."

The key to correctly addressing this issue is to conduct a pragmatic analysis, focusing on the quantity, quality, and degree of controversies surrounding cadres, and avoiding oversimplification.

First, let's discuss "quantity." The concept of quantity is fundamental. Whether someone can be labeled a "controversial cadre" depends on quantitative analysis. This includes two aspects: first, whether the controversy is about specific issues, certain aspects, or the overall performance of the cadre. If the cadre is generally good but has some weaknesses and shortcomings, this is a matter of leveraging strengths and avoiding weaknesses. Second, whether the controversy involves a few individuals, a minority, or a significant number of people. If a few or a minority of people criticize a cadre, this can happen at any time. Even if a cadre faces controversy among a significant number of people, further analysis is needed to determine if it is due to the cadre's incompetence or issues related to family, interpersonal, or interest relationships. For example, some grassroots cadres who work with the masses daily and handle personal interests may offend people and lose votes. It is unscientific and irresponsible to label someone as a "controversial cadre" and restrict their use based on a few complaints or letters without thorough investigation.

Next, let's talk about "quality." Quantitative analysis can only determine the scope of the controversy but cannot address the nature of the problem. It cannot explain whether the controversy is about major or minor issues, or whether it is due to the cadre's subjective or objective reasons (or which is the primary factor). There are many types of opinions and controversies about cadres, and it is crucial to conduct qualitative analysis to understand the nature of the problem. Through analysis, we need to clarify the focus of the controversy: is it about political errors, legal violations, moral issues, work style, leadership capabilities, or work performance? Or is it purely due to objective reasons leading to misunderstandings and biases about the cadre? Currently, those most likely to face controversy are often reformers and doers. Qualitative analysis of them requires more detailed work. The current reforms are taking place amidst the friction between old and new ideas, the transition between old and new systems, and the coexistence of old and new methods. Given that reforms involve some adjustments to interests and breaking many conventional practices, it is not surprising that controversies about reforms evolve into controversies about reformers. This aspect involves complex situations. We need to be very calm in distinguishing several scenarios: one is that there is nothing to criticize, and the controversy reflects some people's dissatisfaction or inability to adapt to the reforms; another is that there are minor errors in the process of reform, which are difficult to completely avoid subjectively and objectively; another is that significant problems have indeed occurred, mainly due to lack of experience or unclear boundaries; and finally, there are those who use the name of reform or exploit reform loopholes to seek personal gain, act unlawfully, and harm the interests of the Party and the people. Among these, the first and fourth scenarios are not actually "controversial" issues. For the second and third scenarios, the controversies should be treated fairly, with a protective and tolerant attitude. As long as they acknowledge their shortcomings and work to correct them, they should still be boldly promoted. Otherwise, who would dare to boldly carry out reforms?

Combining quantitative and qualitative analysis, we can have a comprehensive assessment of a cadre, and appropriately handle the controversies surrounding them. Using cadres requires both courage and discernment. When dealing with "controversial cadres," discernment is key, as having discernment leads to having courage. Through pragmatic analysis, we can accurately identify "controversial cadres" and determine whether they are generally excellent but with some flaws, basically competent but with noticeable issues, or have serious or fundamental flaws. This way, we can clearly see whether the controversies affect their use and make appropriate decisions: promote those who should be promoted, use those who should be used, and adjust those who should be adjusted. This is much more practical than vaguely advocating for bold promotion.

Emphasizing the need to analyze controversies over cadres ultimately aims to convey this point: the use of the term "controversial cadres" should be cautious and infrequent. For cadres who are implicitly labeled with this term, organizational care and support should be provided to reduce unnecessary troubles. Because regardless of how it is interpreted or limited, the term "controversial cadres" is inherently ambiguous, and people will inevitably have their own understandings of it, consciously or unconsciously imposing psychological pressure on the individuals involved. This is detrimental to motivating cadres and advancing various reforms.

### 对干部的“争议”要作分析

　　对干部的“争议”要作分析
    张黎洲
    某些干部被人告上一状，或者因为出点毛病挨了批评，或者因为某种缘由上了“流言榜”，往往就被戴上“有争议的干部”帽子，提拔使用也不免受到影响。有人为其抱不平，呼吁要敢于大胆起用有争议的干部，这自然是值得称道的。可是仔细一想，敢于大胆起用似乎还不是问题的症结，首先需加研究的，倒是“有争议”这个概念本身，以及如何界定“有争议的干部”。
    正确看待这个问题，关键是要进行实事求是的分析，把握住对干部争议的数、质、度，切忌简单化。
    先说“数”。数量的概念是最基本的概念。能否把某人称为“有争议的干部”，离不开定量分析。定量分析包括两方面：一是要看对某个干部是在个别问题、某个方面还是整体上有争议。总体上是好的，个别方面有弱点和不足，这是扬长避短的问题，二是要看对某个干部是个别人、少数人还是相当一部分人有争议。个别、少数人评头论足，对某些干部任用上有看法，这在什么时候都会有。即便某个干部在相当一部分人中有争议，也还要作具体分析，看看确因这个干部不合格、不称职，或者是由于亲属关系、人际关系、利益关系之类的因素在起作用。比如有些基层干部，天天做群众工作，处理人们切身利害问题，难免得罪人，丢选票。那种“听到风，就是雨”，听到一点批评意见，收到几封告状信，事情不分巨细，情况未经弄清，就把某人看成“有争议的干部”限制使用，是不科学、不严肃的，也是对干部不负责的表现。
    再说“质”。定量分析，只能回答对干部争议的范围，却不能回答问题的“质”，无法说明争议的是大是大非问题，还是小是小非问题，是干部主观原因还是客观原因（或何者为主）引起的争议。对干部的意见和争议多种多样，应当十分注重定性分析，弄清是什么性质的问题。要通过分析，弄清争议的焦点，到底是政治错误问题、违法乱纪问题，还是意识品德问题、思想作风问题，还是领导能力问题、工作实绩问题？甚至这些问题哪个方面都算不大上，而纯属客观原因导致对干部的误解和偏见。当前，最容易引起争议的，往往是一些改革者和实干家，对他们的定性分析更得下过细的功夫。当前的改革，是在新旧思想摩擦、新旧体制交替、新旧办法并存的情况下进行的，加上改革是一种探索试验，要涉及某些利益调整，要冲破许多常规积习，由对改革的争议演化到对改革者的争议是一点也不奇怪的。这方面的争议，涉及错综复杂的情况。我们要非常冷静地区别几种情况：一种是，本来没有什么可挑剔的，争议反映了某些人对改革的不满意或不适应；一种是，从事改革之中有小错，主客观上说都是难以完全避免的；一种是，确实出了较大的毛病，主要还是经验不足、界限不清之类的原因造成的；还有一种，则是假借改革之名或钻改革的空子，谋私枉法，为非作歹，损害党和人民的利益。其中一、四种实际上都不是什么“有争议”的问题，对二、三种引起的争议要公正对待，采取爱护、宽容的态度，只要他们正视不足，注意改正，还是要大胆起用。否则，谁还敢于大胆搞改革呢？
    定量分析和定性分析加到一起，对一个干部就可以有个全面的估计，在看待对他们的争议上也能把握住适当的“度”。用人，是既要讲胆，又要讲识的。对待“有争议的干部”，则主要取决于识，有识才能有胆嘛！通过实事求是的分析，正确识别了“有争议的干部”，对他们究竟属于比较优秀但也有缺点，还是基本称职而毛病突出，还是有较严重的甚至根本性缺陷的干部，可以看得一清二楚，对争议是否影响其任用也可得出相应的结论，该提拔的提拔，该使用的使用，该调整的调整，这比笼统地讲大胆起用不是实在得多吗？当然，我们说干部有个别支流问题、小是小非问题、少数人中引起争议的问题不应影响提拔使用，是一般而论的。也不能排斥另一种情况，即有些干部虽属一般性争议，但放到较高层次、较重要位置、从事某特定领导工作不合适的也不能勉强，同样要讲实事求是，这里也有一个正确把握“度”的问题。
    强调对干部的争议要作分析，归根结底是想说明这样一点：使用“有争议的干部”这种提法还是宜慎宜少，对被无形戴上这个帽子的干部也要以组织的关心爱护使之减少无谓的烦恼。因为不论如何铨释、限制，“有争议的干部”的涵义毕竟是不确定的，人们对它有各自的理解，也势必有意无意给当事人带来精神压力。这对调动干部积极性，对不断推进各项改革，都是不利的。
