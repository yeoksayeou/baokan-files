　　形形色色的布
    可食布它是以优质的含偏碱蛋白质、氨基酸、果酱以及铁、镁、钙等多种微量元素合制而成。用这种布制成的服装专供远洋航海、野外勘察、登山探险人员穿用，一旦遇到断粮，布衣就是充饥的佳肴了。
    变色布　它是用光敏化纤织成的，可随着环境的不同而改变颜色。在丛林里布呈绿色，在荒原上又变为黄色，其色彩变幻多端，最适宜作伪装服。
    吸味布　这种布由英国化学家首创。穿上吸味布成衣能吸收空气中的有害气体，防止其侵入体内。用吸味布制成的窗帘可净化室内空气，用它包装仪器能防腐蚀。
    发光布　该布夜晚能发出淡淡的冷光，穿着这种布夜行时，目标显著，可减少交通事故。演员穿着它更增添艺术感染力。
    纸布　由塑料和纸浆混合制成，造价低廉，新颖美观。在日本、美国和北欧各地越来越多的人喜欢穿纸布衣服，因而十分畅销。
