On the afternoon of Chinese New Year's Eve, the residents of Mangna Village in Heping Township, Denglian Dai and Jingpo Autonomous County, Yunnan Province, were busy preparing their New Year's meal. They rushed out of their temporary shelters to greet a distant visitor—Vice Governor Zhao Tingguang of Yunnan Province.

"Happy New Year! Happy New Year!" the villagers exclaimed, offering cups of hot tea to the guest. Zhao Tingguang took the tea from an elderly Dai woman and drank it in several gulps. He then bent down and entered the tent of farmer He Guolai.

"Are you having glutinous rice for the New Year? Do you have meat and wine?" Zhao Tingguang asked with concern. He Guolai replied, "Yes, yes. All 38 households in the village have received relief funds. The New Year is not a problem!" Zhao Tingguang said, "That's good. The Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government have asked me to come and visit everyone. Have a good New Year, and after the holiday, let's rally our spirits and strive for a bumper harvest in the first year after the earthquake."

At this moment, a young man in the crowd shouted, "From the central government to the local government, everyone is thinking of us. If we can't achieve a bumper harvest, we'll be ashamed!" This was followed by a burst of laughter.

Zhao Tingguang continued to inspect and inquire, arriving at the tent of young farmer Dao Kaiming. Dao Kaiming's mother was playing with her granddaughter. Zhao Tingguang stroked the child's face and asked, "How old is the child? What is her name?" This question made the old woman laugh. It turned out that the child was born on the day of the earthquake last November 6. To remember this day, the villagers gave the child a special name—Yu Zhen. Zhao Tingguang laughed and said, "That's interesting. It seems your spirits are good, and there is hope."

Just as Zhao Tingguang was chatting with the villagers of Mangna Village, the Dai farmer Nan Zineng and his family in Gengxuan Town, Yunnan Province, had prepared a table of food and insisted that Zhao Tingguang come to taste the Dai cuisine. Unable to refuse the hospitality, Zhao Tingguang brought gifts to Nan Zineng's home.

In the small courtyard filled with tiles and wood, the host and guest sat under the open sky, chatting and laughing as they enjoyed the New Year's meal. Zhao Tingguang ate hand-pressed glutinous rice and cold vegetable salad, and just as he was about to put down his chopsticks, the hostess, Fu Zhenglan, said, "In our Dai home, the more you eat, the happier we are." Zhao Tingguang smiled and picked up another piece of cold fish, saying in Dai, "I eat fish, I eat fish." Then he raised his cup and proposed, "Come, let's drink to the unity of our nation! I am a Yao, and I toast the Dai with a cup." As soon as the words were spoken, a Hui and a Bai cadre present also raised their cups to clink with the host. "Cheers! Cheers!" The laughter that erupted drowned out the sound of the clinking cups.

As the stars twinkled in the night sky, the distant guest and the host said their goodbyes. The host instructed, "Welcome to visit again during the Water Splashing Festival." Zhao Tingguang replied, "I will come to see the new look of the disaster area." At that moment, the television was broadcasting the laughter from the Spring Festival Gala in the capital. On the night of Chinese New Year's Eve, the earthquake-stricken area was as lively as the rest of the country.

　　云南省副省长除夕访灾区
　　防震棚里欢声笑语春意浓
    新华社昆明２月６日电  （记者李承祖）“拜年，拜年！”大年三十下午，正忙着做年饭的云南省耿马傣族佤族自治县贺派乡芒那寨的灾民们跑出防震棚，争相迎接远方来客——云南省副省长赵廷光。
    “客从省城来，８００多公里山路要行三天呢！”乡亲们端来了一杯杯热茶。赵廷光双手接过一位傣族老大妈的茶水连喝了几口，又弯腰钻进了农民贺国莱家的防震棚。
    “过年有糯米饭吃吗？有肉有酒吗？”赵廷光关切地问。贺国莱连声说：“有，有。全寨３８户人家，家家领到了救济款。过年不成问题！”赵廷光说：“这就好。省委、省政府委托我来看望大家，大家好好过个年，节后振奋精神，夺取大震后的第一个丰收年。”
    这时，一个小伙子在人群中大声说：“从中央到地方都在想着我们，我们夺不了丰收要害羞哩！”随后，响起一片笑声。
    赵廷光边看边问，来到青年农民刀开明的防震棚里。刀开明的阿妈正在逗孙女。赵廷光摸摸孩子的脸问：“孩子多大啦，叫什么名字？”这一下把老人问得笑了起来。原来，这孩子出生在去年１１月６日大地震发生的当天。为了记住这个日子，乡亲们给孩子取了个特殊的名字，——玉震。赵廷光听了不禁笑道：“挺风趣，看来，你们精神面貌不错，有希望。”
    就在赵廷光和芒那寨的乡亲拉家常时，耿宣镇巷允寨傣族农民南子能一家备好了一桌饭菜，硬拉赵廷光去尝尝傣味。盛情难却，赵廷光带着礼物来到了南子能家。
    在堆满瓦片和木料的小院落中，宾主露天坐下，有说有笑地吃年饭。赵廷光吃了手抓糯米饭和凉拌青菜，刚想放筷子，主妇俸正兰就说：“在我们傣家作客，吃得越多我们越喜欢。”赵廷光笑着又夹起一块凉拌鱼，并用傣话说：“我金巴，金巴（吃鱼）。”接着，他又举杯提议道：“来，为我们民族团结干杯！我是瑶族，我敬傣家一杯。”话音刚落，在场的一名佤族和一名白族干部也举杯与主人相碰。“干杯！干杯！”骤起的笑声盖过了酒杯的碰撞声。
    繁星闪烁时，远方的客人与主人握手话别。主人嘱咐：“欢迎泼水节再来。”赵廷光回答：“到时来看震区的新面貌。”这时，电视机里响起了首都春节晚会的欢笑声。除夕之夜，地震灾区同全国各地一样热闹。
