French Muslims Oppose Publication of "The Satanic Verses"
Spanish Culture Minister Proposes Publishing "The Satanic Verses"

New York, February 25, The Xinhua News Agency reported that the National Federation of Muslims in France issued a statement in Paris today, urging relevant authorities to take measures to prevent the publication of British author Salman Rushdie's book "The Satanic Verses" in France.

The statement pointed out that France should prevent any of its citizens from being insulted due to their beliefs. The statement expressed regret over the authorities' unwillingness to stop the book's publication in France. The statement believed that this attitude could very likely lead to serious public disorder.

According to the statement, a French Christian publisher has announced that it holds the rights to publish the French version of "The Satanic Verses." This publisher may publish the book in France in June this year.

Madrid, February 24, The Xinhua News Agency reported that Spanish Culture Minister Jorge Semprun proposed that the world should publish Salman Rushdie's novel "The Satanic Verses" as a measure to counter the death sentence issued by Iranian religious leader Ayatollah Khomeini against the British writer.

Semprun made the suggestion at a meeting held by Spanish publishers on the 23rd. He stated that Western governments would support any initiatives by the publishing industry to defend freedom of publication.

Semprun said that to ensure the publication, distribution, and sale of Rushdie's novel, Western governments would support any "individual, collective, or joint actions" with European publishers.

According to reports, Spanish publishers have decided not to participate in the 2nd Tehran International Cultural Fair to be held in Iran in May. The Spanish Culture Minister also called on other countries and publishers in the European Community to boycott this fair.

February 25, thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the Penguin Publishing House in New York to protest against the publication of Salman Rushdie's novel "The Satanic Verses."

　　法国穆斯林反对出版《撒旦诗篇》
    西文化大臣建议出版《撒旦诗篇》
    新华社巴黎２月２５日电  法国穆斯林全国协会今天在巴黎发表一项公报，呼吁有关当局采取措施，阻止英国作家拉什迪的著作《撒旦诗篇》在法国出版。
    公报指出，法国应该防止它的每一个公民因信仰而遭受侮辱。公报对当局不打算阻止此书在法国出版的态度表示遗憾。公报认为，这种态度很有可能会使公共秩序严重混乱。
    据公报透露，法国一家基督教出版社已宣布拥有《撒旦诗篇》的法文版出版权。这家出版社有可能在今年６月在法国出版此书。
    新华社马德里２月２４日电　西班牙文化大臣豪尔赫·森普伦建议全世界出版萨曼·拉什迪的小说《撒旦诗篇》，作为对付伊朗宗教领袖阿亚图拉·霍梅尼判处这位英国作家死刑的一种措施。
    森普伦是在西班牙出版商２３日举行的一次会议上提出上述建议的。他表示，西政府将支持出版界维护出版自由的任何倡议。
    森普伦说，为保证拉什迪小说出版、发行和销售，西政府将支持任何“与欧洲出版商的个人、集体或联合”行动措施。
    据报道，西班牙出版商已决定，不参加今年５月在伊朗举行的第２届德黑兰国际文化博览会。西班牙文化大臣也呼吁欧洲共同体的其它国家及出版商抵制这届博览会。（附图片）
