	More Important Than Capital and Equipment:
	—A Survey of Dalian's Introduction of Foreign Intelligence
	By Wang Yougong, People's Daily Reporter

	Investing a large amount of capital, a set of production equipment for composite cold storage insulation boards was imported from abroad, but it lay idle for a long time at the Dalian Refrigeration Machinery Factory. The reason was that products made from domestic materials did not meet the quality requirements. Requesting assistance from domestic cooperative units and research departments was unsuccessful. Later, the factory hired a foreign expert for guidance, and the equipment quickly "revived."

	There are at least 100 factories in Dalian, like the Dalian Refrigeration Machinery Factory, that have promoted technological progress through international talent exchanges and technical cooperation.

	Since 1985, Dalian has established relatively stable cooperative relationships with more than 30 national-level talent exchange institutions in 12 countries and regions, initially forming a relatively smooth channel for introduction and dispatch. By the end of 1988, the city had introduced more than 500 foreign experts in the fields of industry, transportation, science and technology, foreign trade, finance, and commerce, of whom 27 served as consultants and two as factory directors and deputy factory directors. The city also sent more than 1,200 personnel for economic and technical training abroad for more than one month each.

	In recent years, nearly 3,000 engineering and technical personnel, managerial cadres, and nearly 1,000 skilled workers in Dalian have received training from foreign experts. Under the guidance of foreign experts, many major technical problems have been solved, a batch of products that can replace imports have been produced, dozens of new export products have been developed, nearly 100 products have reached or approached world advanced levels, and more than 20 enterprises, including the Dalian Heavy Machinery Factory, have entered the ranks of the world's advanced enterprises, beginning to cooperate with foreign countries in design, research, and manufacturing. According to incomplete statistics, the value created by Dalian through the introduction of intelligence has exceeded 100 million yuan.

	The initial success has led Dalian to have a new leap in its understanding of the introduction of foreign intelligence.

	Insight 1: The introduction of equipment and technology cannot replace the introduction of intelligence, but the introduction of intelligence can replace part of the introduction of equipment and technology. In recent years, Dalian has spent nearly $20 million to introduce more than 30 numerical control machining centers. Although workers can operate them, due to insufficient mastery of their performance, especially the lack of full development of computer software, the utilization rate is only about 15% to 20%. Later, foreign experts were invited to explain and operate in practice, solving most of the technical keys, training more than 100 engineering and technical personnel and operators, and increasing the utilization rate of this batch of equipment to over 50%.

	The Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory originally planned to spend $480,000 to introduce diesel engine test equipment, instruments, and computer software from abroad. They invited a foreign expert with 40 years of experience to consult. The expert proposed solving the problem in three parts: some equipment and instruments can be manufactured by the factory itself or purchased domestically, and the computer software can be developed with his help. The domestically unsolvable instruments and equipment can be introduced with his help. In the end, the project only cost $180,000, and a batch of engineering and technical personnel and foreign trade personnel who can master the development of advanced computer software were also trained.

	Insight 2: The introduction of foreign intelligence compared to the introduction of equipment and technology is a good way with less investment and more output, and it is also a form of cooperation with less risk. Since 1980, the Dalian Heavy Machinery Factory has carried out technical cooperation with 19 companies in six countries, including the Federal Republic of Germany, mastering some advanced technologies and modern management methods, completing the technological transformation and digestion of cooperative products. It has provided large-scale technical equipment for 270-plus national key engineering construction projects, achieving import substitution savings of over $55 million and earning over $16 million in foreign exchange.

	Since its opening up, Dalian has introduced more than 1,200 technological and equipment projects from abroad, with a total value of nearly $1.2 billion. In the past two years, it has only spent $1 million on the introduction of intelligence, which is not enough to buy one piece of equipment, but it has indeed produced remarkable economic and social benefits.

	Insight 3: The introduction of foreign intelligence can effectively shorten the gap between some technologies and the rest of the world. In recent years, the city has cooperated with foreign countries in research and joint breakthroughs, making more than 20 scientific research achievements reach world advanced levels. For some long-cycle, high-cost, and high-difficulty projects, such as in agriculture and fisheries, adopting talent exchanges and mutual learning is a good way to invest less, see greater results, and directly skip several technological stages to catch up with world advanced levels. In recent years, the city has developed several agricultural projects through talent exchanges and cooperative research. If relying solely on domestic research, it would take at least 10 years and cost hundreds of millions of yuan in research funds.

	Insight 4: Through talent exchanges, trade channels can be opened up, and the development of an outward-looking economy can be promoted. In the past three years, the city has promoted more than 20 economic cooperations through talent exchanges, developing trade worth more than $30 million from talent exchanges. For example, a foreign company and relevant departments in Dalian established a fixed trade relationship through this method. Currently, Dalian's trade volume with this company has reached more than $10 million.

　　比资金设备更重要的引进
    ——大连市引进国外智力的情况调查
    本报记者  王友恭
    投下高额资金，一套生产组合冷库隔热板的设备从国外引进，可它在大连冷冻机厂一“躺”就是好久。原因是用国产材质制成的产品达不到质量要求。请国内协作单位和科研部门帮助，均未成功。后来，该厂从国外聘请一位专家指导，这设备很快“复活”。
    像大连冷冻机厂这样通过国际人才交流，开展技术合作而促进企业技术进步的工厂，在大连市至少有１００多家。
    １９８５年以来，大连市先后与１２个国家和地区的３０多个国家级人才交流机构建立了比较固定的合作关系，初步形成一个比较畅通的引进、派出渠道。到１９８８年底，该市已引进工业、交通、科技、外贸、金融、商业等方面的外国专家５００多人次，其中２７名担任顾问，两名担任厂长和分厂厂长。该市还派出经济技术方面研修一个月以上的人员１２００多名。
    近几年来，该市已有近３０００名工程技术人员、管理干部和近千名技术工人接受过外国专家的培训。在外国专家指导下，解决了许多个重大技术难题，生产出一批可替代进口的产品，研制出几十种出口新产品，使近百种产品达到或接近世界先进水平，使大连重型机器厂等２０多个企业跻身于世界先进行列，开始与国外合作设计、合作研究、合作制造。据不完全统计，该市通过引进智力所创造的价值已超过１亿元。
    初尝甜头，使大连市对引进国外智力的认识有了新的飞跃。
    认识１：设备和技术引进不能代替智力引进，而引进智力却可以代替部分设备和技术引进。大连市近几年花了近２０００万美元引进３０多台数控加工中心，虽然工人能够操作，但是由于对其性能掌握不够，特别是计算机软件没有充分开发，开工率仅为１５％—２０％左右。后来，请来外国专家，通过讲解和实际操作，解决了大部分技术关键，培养了１００多名工程技术人员和操作工人，使这批设备的开工率达到５０％以上。
    大连机车车辆工厂原计划花４８万美元，从国外引进机车柴油机试验设备、仪器和计算机软件。他们请一位有４０年工作经验的外国专家来厂咨询。专家提出分三部分解决：有些设备和仪器可由该厂自己制造或在国内购买，计算机软件由他帮助研制，国内暂时解决不了的仪器设备由他帮助引进。最后，这个项目只花了１８万美元，还培养了一批能够掌握高级计算机软件开发的工程技术人员和涉外技贸人员。
    认识２：引进国外智力和引进设备技术相比，是一种投入少、产出多的好办法，也是一种风险小的合作形式。大连重型机器厂自１９８０年以来先后与联邦德国等六个国家的１９个公司进行技术合作，掌握了一些先进技术和现代化管理方法，完成了合作产品的技术转化及消化吸收。已为国家重点工程建设项目提供大型技术装备２７０多台套，实现了替代进口节汇５５００多万美元，创汇１６００多万美元。
    大连市自开放以来，从国外引进的技术、设备项目共１２００多项，总金额近１２亿美元，而近两年在引进智力方面只花了１００万美元，还不够买一项设备花的钱多，但它确实产生了令人瞩目的经济效益和社会效益。
    认识３：引进国外智力，能够有效地缩短一些技术与国外的差距。近几年来，该市与国外开展合作研究和联合攻关，使２０多项科研成果达到世界先进水平。对于一些周期长、费用高、难度大，如农业、水产方面的攻关项目，采取人才交流，相互取长补短更是投资少、见效大、可以直接跨过几个技术阶段赶上世界先进水平的好办法。该市近几年通过人才交流，合作研究，开发了好几个农业方面的项目。如果完全靠自己研究，至少也要１０年左右的时间，还要花科研经费几百万元。
    认识４：通过人才交流，可以开拓贸易渠道，促进外向型经济的发展。近３年来，该市通过人才交流促成经济合作２０多项，从人才交流入手发展贸易额达３０００多万美元。如国外一家公司和大连有关部门之间建立固定贸易关系，就是通过这种办法进行的。目前，大连市与该公司的贸易额已达１０００多万美元。
