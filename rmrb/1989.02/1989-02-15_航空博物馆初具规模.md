China's first large-scale aviation museum open to the public is now taking shape. As of today, the museum has collected 131 aircraft, totaling 71 different models. It also houses samples of surface-to-air missiles, radar systems, and aviation bombs.

Each aircraft in the museum is a testament to a significant historical event. Among them are the personal planes of leaders such as Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, and Zhu De, as well as aircraft that played crucial roles in the Korean War. The variety of models on display is impressive. The museum is scheduled to officially open on October 1, 1989.

　　航空博物馆初具规模
    本报北京２月１４日讯  我国第一座对外开放的大型航空博物馆，目前已初具规模。截至今日，该馆收存飞机１３１架，共７１种型号。还收存了地空导弹、雷达、航空炸弹等武器样品。
    该馆存放的每一架飞机，都记载着一个重要历史事件。其中有当年毛泽东、周恩来、朱德等领导人的座机，有在抗美援朝战争中建立功勋的飞机等，各种型号琳琅满目。该馆预定于今年１０月１日正式开馆。
