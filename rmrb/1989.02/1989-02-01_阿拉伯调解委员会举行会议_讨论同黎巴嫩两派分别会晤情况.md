The Arab Mediation Committee for Resolving the Lebanese Crisis held a meeting on January 30th.

The meeting primarily discussed the recent separate consultations held by the committee with the leaders of the Christian and Muslim factions in Lebanon.

According to reports, the meeting adjourned later in the evening on the 30th and will continue on the 31st, drafting a document that includes the views of both Lebanese factions.

Kuwait, Jordan, Algeria, Tunisia, Sudan, the United Arab Emirates, and the Secretary-General of the Arab League, as members of the mediation committee, attended the meeting along with Lebanese Muslim leader Hussein, Acting Prime Minister Hus, Christian leader and interim military government Prime Minister Oren.

The head of the mediation committee, Kuwaiti Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sabah, told reporters during the adjournment that the leaders of both Lebanese factions expressed their acceptance of the committee's mediation but also expressed concerns about rebuilding peace and security in Lebanon.

The Lebanese faction leaders praised the efforts of the mediation committee. Hussein said that the convening of the meeting is beneficial for resolving the Lebanese crisis. Oren stated, "The meeting was filled with mutual understanding and sincere friendship." Hus expressed his willingness to work closely with the mediation committee to jointly seek solutions to the Lebanese crisis.

Since the end of the term of the former Lebanese president in September last year, due to disagreements between the Muslim and Christian factions over the selection of a new president, a situation arose where there is no president but two governments coexist.

　　阿拉伯调解委员会举行会议
    讨论同黎巴嫩两派分别会晤情况
    新华社突尼斯１月３０日电  阿拉伯解决黎巴嫩危机调解委员会３０日在这里举行会议。
    会议主要讨论了日前该委员会同黎巴嫩基督教和穆斯林两派领导人分别进行会晤的情况。
    据报道，会议在３０日晚些时候休会，３１日将继续举行会议，并将起草一份包括黎巴嫩两派意见的文件。
    科威特、约旦、阿尔及利亚、突尼斯、苏丹、阿拉伯联合酋长国和阿盟秘书长作为调解委员会的成员，同黎巴嫩穆斯林领导人侯赛尼，代总理胡斯，基督教领导人、临时军政府总理奥恩一起出席了今天的会议。
    调解委员会负责人、科威特副首相兼外交大臣萨巴赫在会议休会时对记者说，黎巴嫩两派领导人都表示接受该委员会的调解，但他们对重建黎巴嫩的和平与安全表示担忧。
    黎巴嫩两派领导人对调解委员会的努力表示称赞。侯赛尼说，会议的召开有利于黎巴嫩危机的解决。奥恩说，“会议充满着相互谅解和诚挚友好的气氛”。胡斯表示要同调解委员会密切合作，共同寻求解决黎巴嫩危机的途径和办法。
    黎巴嫩自去年９月前总统任期届满后，由于穆斯林和基督教两派在新总统人选问题上存在分歧，而形成了没有总统却有两个政府并存的局面。
