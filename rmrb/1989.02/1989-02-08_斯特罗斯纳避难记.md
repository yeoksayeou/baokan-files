Former Paraguayan President Stroessner departed on February 5 aboard a Boeing 707, leaving the country he had ruled for 35 years to seek refuge in Brazil. Thus began his life in exile.

Accompanying him on the flight to Brazil were six security personnel, his eldest son Gustavo, and his daughter-in-law. His younger son Alfredo, who was vacationing in Uruguay, did not return to Paraguay and declared that he would not accompany his father into exile. Stroessner's relatives and friends were either arrested or in hiding, and none came to see him off. The airport was desolate, with only fewer than 200 reporters and onlookers present to witness the event.

Just five days earlier, this would have been unimaginable. During Stroessner's rule, he was so powerful. The international airport in the capital, Asunción, was named after him. A city on the Paraguay-Brazil border was also named after him, and there were dozens of schools and districts named after him. Now, he saw people tearing down his portraits.

Stroessner was overthrown on February 2 by a coup led by Paraguay's second most powerful figure, Rodriguez. This descendant of a German brewer, known as "the blond boy," began ruling Paraguay at the age of 41, serving eight terms as president without any competition. Last year, the 76-year-old Stroessner attempted to have his eldest son, who held the rank of major, Gustavo, succeed him, which was opposed by Army Chief Rodriguez, triggering the coup.

After landing at a military airfield on the outskirts of São Paulo, Brazil, Stroessner was taken to the Furnas hydroelectric power station in Itumbiara City to stay temporarily. Considering security concerns, the Brazilian government stated that they would not disclose Stroessner's future residence. Regardless, Stroessner, like all dictators, met a tragic end.

　　斯特罗斯纳避难记
    新华社记者　王树柏
    巴拉圭前总统斯特罗斯纳２月５日乘坐一架波音７０７客机离开了他统治长达３５年之久的国家，前往巴西，从而开始了他的避难生涯。
    同他一起乘飞机去巴西的有６名安全人员、他的长子吉斯塔沃和儿媳。正在乌拉圭度假的小儿子阿尔弗雷多没有回巴拉圭，并宣称他不跟父亲一起去避难。斯特罗斯纳的亲朋故旧或是被捕、或是在逃，无一人前去送行。机场上冷冷清清，除机场安全人员外，只有不到２００名记者和好奇者守候在那里，以便看个究竟。
    要是在５天前，这是一件不可思议的事。斯特罗斯纳当政之时，何等威风。首都亚松森国际机场就以斯的名字命名。巴拉圭和巴西边界有一座城市也以他的名字命名，至于学校、街区用他的名字命名的不下几十处。而今他看到的是人们正在撕下他的画像。
    斯特罗斯纳是在２月２日被巴拉圭第２号实权人物罗德里格斯发动政变推翻的。这位德国啤酒商的后裔、人称“黄毛儿”的斯特罗斯纳，从４１岁开始统治巴拉圭，连任８届总统，没有竞争对手。去年，７６岁的斯特罗斯纳企图要他那只有中校军衔的大儿子古斯塔沃接班掌权，遭到第一军军长罗德里格斯的反对，诱发了这次政变。
    斯特罗斯纳在巴西圣保罗郊外军用机场着陆之后，被一架巴西飞机送往伊图穆比亚拉城的弗尔纳斯水电站暂时栖身。考虑到安全方面的原因，巴西官方表示不便透露斯今后的住所。不管怎样，斯特罗斯纳同一切独裁者一样，下场无疑是可悲的。
