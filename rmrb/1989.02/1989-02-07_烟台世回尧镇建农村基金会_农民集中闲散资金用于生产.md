Shihuiyao Township Establishes Rural Cooperative Fund to Concentrate Farmers' Idle Funds for Production

	Newspaper: Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, February 6 - After farmers have become somewhat wealthy, how should they use the money in their hands? Shandong Province's Yantai Zhifu District's Shihuiyao Township has established a rural cooperative fund, guiding farmers to pool their idle consumption funds to develop the rural economy.

	Currently, this cooperative fund has raised 660,000 yuan, resolving the contradiction between production needs and insufficient funds, and significantly reducing the tendency to spend money extravagantly.

	In recent years, the rural economy of Shihuiyao Township has undergone favorable changes, with per capita distribution exceeding 1,000 yuan in 1987. Under these circumstances, some farmers began to focus on consumption, such as extravagant weddings and funerals, and competing to buy high-end household appliances. Since 1988, while educating farmers to correctly understand their level of wealth, the township has established a rural cooperative fund to attract idle social funds for use in developing production.

	This fund is a rural collective financial organization under the leadership of the township government. In business management, it strictly adheres to national financial regulations and policies, accepts guidance from banks and other departments, and has established a board of directors consisting of member units, individuals, and township leaders and relevant departments to jointly consult and decide on major matters such as the collection, management, use, and distribution of profits of the funds. It has formulated the fund's charter and work regulations. The township's Zhenxing Tile Factory wanted to launch a new product and had procured 30,000 yuan worth of scarce raw materials, but due to insufficient funds, the goods could not be delivered.

	The factory, with a try-it attitude, sought help from the fund. After thorough deliberation, the fund decided to lend 30,000 yuan, ensuring the timely launch of the new product and increasing the factory's annual profit by 30%. As the fund's role in supporting production became increasingly recognized, the number of members joining the fund gradually increased.

	Currently, the consumption temperature among farmers in Shihuiyao Township has significantly decreased, and the "investment heat" for agricultural production is surging. According to statistics, farmers' investment in production has increased by 30% compared to 1987, while per capita consumption remains the same as in 1987. Many farmers have taken the money originally intended for building houses, buying TVs, and refrigerators and used it to purchase productive fixed assets and fertilizers, pesticides, and high-quality seeds.

### 烟台世回尧镇建农村基金会　农民集中闲散资金用于生产

　　烟台世回尧镇建农村基金会
　　农民集中闲散资金用于生产
    新华社济南２月６日电  （通讯员李敏、孙吉录）农民初步富裕起来之后，手中的钱应往哪里花？山东省烟台芝罘区世回尧镇成立了农村合作基金会，引导农民把攥在手里的消费资金集中起来，用以发展农村经济。
    目前，这个合作基金会已筹集资金６６万元，解决了生产的急需与资金不足的矛盾，花钱比阔的风气大减。
    近几年，世回尧镇农村经济发生可喜变化，１９８７年人均分配超千元。在这种情况下，部分农民开始在消费上做文章，如婚丧嫁娶大操大办，争相购买高档家用电器等。自１９８８年以来，这个镇在教育农民正确认识自己的富裕程度的同时，成立了农村合作基金会，将社会闲散资金吸引过来，用于发展再生产。
    这个基金会是在镇政府领导下的农村集体金融组织。在业务管理上，严格遵守国家的金融法规和政策，接受银行等部门的指导，并设立了由入会单位、个人和镇领导干部及有关部门参加的董事会，共同协商决定资金的聚集、管理、使用和收益分配等重大事宜，制订了基金会章程和工作制度。这个镇的振兴制盖厂要上新产品，采购到价值３万元的紧缺原料，由于资金不足，货物难进。
    这个厂抱着试一试的态度到基金会求援，基金会在充分论证的基础上决定贷款３万元，保证新产品及时上马，使这个厂年利润增长了３０％。基金会的这种支持生产的作用逐渐被大家认识后，入会人员日渐增多。
    目前，世回尧镇农民消费温度大大下降，对农业生产的“投入热”蓬勃兴起。据统计，农民用于生产投资比１９８７年增长３０％，人均消费与１９８７年持平。许多农民把原来准备盖楼房、买彩电、冰箱的钱拿出来，用于购置生产性固定资产和化肥、农药、优良品种等。
