Since last July, our province's rural financial departments have encountered obstruction from some village cadres while trying to recover overdue loans. Some collection staff have even been attacked and beaten by certain debtors.

In Xīluó City's Hónghuā Township, Shuānghóng Village owed over 200,000 yuan in agricultural loans and credit union loans. The village later distributed this debt among households, making it difficult to collect. Last September, when villagers were actively acknowledging and repaying their debts, the village committee director, Hán Dōngxiān, issued a decree: no one was allowed to contact the collection staff, no one was allowed to hand over the debt details to the financial departments, and no party members or cadres were allowed to lead by example in repaying the loans. Anyone who violated these rules would be expelled from Shuānghóng Village. As a result, some villagers who had already acknowledged their debts went to the credit union to demand the return of their loan documents, and those who had already repaid their loans demanded refunds, causing the loan collection work to stall.

On November 13 last year, four loan collection staff from the Xiálíu branch of the Hénɡdōng County Agricultural Bank went to the home of Dīnɡ Hénɡxiánɡ, a villager from Dànɡnítánɡ Village in Yánɡtánɡ Township, to collect an overdue loan of 1,420 yuan. Dīnɡ's father and son pushed and chased the collection staff out of the door. Dīnɡ Hénɡxiánɡ also incited some villagers to beat the collection staff. A hospital examination revealed that all four collection staff had been injured. It is understood that since last October, Hénɡdōng County has seen seven incidents of loan collection staff being beaten, with 11 staff members threatened and beaten by some villagers.

　　催收逾期贷款何错之有？！
    去年７月以来，我省农村金融部门在回收逾期贷款时，遭到少数乡村干部的刁难，有些收款人员还受到个别欠款单位和个人的围攻殴打。
    汨罗市红花乡双红村原欠国家农业贷款和信用社贷款２万多元。后来，村里把这笔贷款分摊到户，长期无法收回。去年９月，正当村民主动认贷还贷时，村委会主任韩冬先规定：不准接触收贷人员，不准将债务明细表交给金融部门，不准党员干部带头归还贷款。谁违反这几条规定，谁就要被赶出双红村。因此，一些已立据认贷的村民找到信用社，要求退回借据，已归还了贷款的要求退钱，致使收贷工作陷于困境。
    去年１１月１３日，衡东县农业银行霞流营业所收贷员周诗华等４人到洋塘乡大泥塘村村民丁衡湘家催收拖欠的１４２０元贷款时，丁家父子竟将收贷员推赶出门。丁衡湘还唆使一些村民殴打收贷人员。经医院检查，４名收贷干部都被打伤。据了解，自去年１０月以来，衡东县曾发生７起殴打收贷人员的事件，有１１名催收贷款的干部遭到一些村民的威胁和殴打。
