West Germans often proudly say that music has permeated our lives and become an indispensable part of it. Statistics show that 50% of West Germans listen to at least 8 hours of music every week, and there are about 4 million amateur musicians nationwide. Most families own pianos, violins, and other musical instruments. Ordinary workers and farmers can also play a musical instrument.

The "Land of Music" hosts a variety of music festivals and competitions every year. The most famous ones include the Bayreuth Festival, the Berlin Celebration Week, and the Ruhr Festival in Recklinghausen. There are also the "Beethoven Festival" held every three years and the "Danube Music Festival," among other activities.

West Germany has about 100 opera houses, 60 concert halls, and 90 professional symphony orchestras, distributed throughout various cities, large and small. People consider attending concerts a noble social activity. During the summer, performances are not only held in luxurious and grand theaters and concert halls but also in the streets or parks, attracting passersby. Sometimes, university students from the music department form a small band and perform on the street on weekends to earn their weekly pocket money. There are also small bands from other cities or rural areas that perform for a few hours to raise funds for their travel expenses.

To maintain and improve the musical literacy of the people, the federal government attaches great importance to music education. There are more than 800 music schools nationwide, where children of preschool age and adults can learn composition, performance, singing, and dancing.

　　酷爱音乐的西德人
    联邦德国人常自豪地说，音乐已渗透到我们的生活中，成为不可缺少的一部分。据统计，联邦德国有５０％的人每周至少听８小时音乐，全国约有４００万业余音乐工作者。多数家庭均有钢琴、小提琴和其它乐器。普通的工人、农民也能演奏一种乐器。
    “音乐之国”每年都要举办丰富多彩的音乐节和各种音乐比赛活动。最著名的有拜罗伊特节会演、柏林庆祝周和雷克林豪森举行的鲁尔节庆祝演出，还有每三年举行一次的“贝多芬节”，“多瑙河音乐节”等活动。
    联邦德国约有１００多家歌剧院、６０多个音乐厅和９０多个专业交响乐团，分布在各大小城市里。人们把听音乐会看成一种高尚的社会活动。仲夏时节，不仅豪华富丽的大剧院和音乐厅里有演出，而且在街头或公园里也同样举行别有风趣的音乐会，吸引着过往行人。有时，音乐系的大学生组成一个小乐队，周末在街头演奏一次，一个星期的零花钱就有了来路；也有从外市或乡村旅游来的小乐队，演出几小时以募集他们的旅费。
    为了保持和提高人民的音乐素养，联邦政府十分重视音乐教育。全国设有８００多所音乐学校，从学龄前儿童到成年人都可以在这里学习作曲、演奏、唱歌和跳舞。
