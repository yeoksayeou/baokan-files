The first time I heard "Xi Chu Yang Guan," I felt very excited. Later, I met several lyricists and composers in the pop music industry, and they all agreed that "Xi Chu Yang Guan" and "Jiang Jiang Jiang" were indeed extraordinary.

Thus, I learned the name of the author—Zhang Chu. However, after hearing "Jiang Jiang Jiang," I eagerly searched for him, only to find that he had left, gone to Tibet. Not long ago, he returned to Beijing, but soon, as in his own song: "Wearing a coarse cloth, you just left." This time, he went south. Before leaving, he only left a message for a friend: "I can't stand it in Beijing."

He is a 20-year-old youth from Xi'an. Perhaps finally realizing that he could only live in his own way, he dropped out of university. He "packs up broken dreams, carries an old bag, licks the wounds in his heart," and "takes a midnight freight train to wander." In this way, he burst into the Beijing pop music scene. However, he did not receive the recognition he deserved from some magazine editors and audio editors. It was the "Songs" editorial department that first published his "Grandpa and Grandma's Story"; it was Wu Haigang, the editor who had previously released "Nothing to My Name" and "Let the World Be Full of Love," who immediately decided to produce the "Jiang Jiang Jiang" tape album for Zhang Chu.

"He writes music with his heart," a young composer's words are very apt. Zhang Chu's lyrics and music depict a complete person who is battered but full of vigor. I am amazed at what kind of life has given Zhang Chu such a powerful psychological force: "When I first faced the world, I told myself, pawn, cross the river, charge! Eat! Checkmate! Checkmate! Checkmate!"

This is a solid manly demeanor, a genuine pain: "On the day I returned home, facing myself, I eat my chariot, I eat my horse, I eat my cannon, I eat my heart."

What is condensed in Zhang Chu's works is a very profound tragic beauty. As Wu Haigang said, "'Xi Bei Feng' is actually more like Shaanbei wind, Zhang Chu's works are truly 'Xi Bei'." From the musical material to the connotation of the lyrics, it permeates a desolate and heroic atmosphere, embodying a deep sadness.

Zhang Chu's works are rarely artificially embellished, but in their simplicity, they reveal a charming allure: "You say you've been away from home for a long time, on the seaside you see the fisherman's daughter waving to the sea. In the desert night, you look at the gentle eyes of the camel, at 20 years old, by the roadside you see me sitting alone at the door" ("Let's Go").

Indeed, Zhang Chu's works clearly show a natural and unforced quality. One can hear that he has accumulated a wealth of folk materials, which have not been well polished and controlled, but they are genuine cries of the soul, with little obvious interference from ideology, and thus gain an inexplicable power. The power of music comes from the power of the person. And for many years, our music has always lacked a strong internal force, which is not a problem that can be dismissed with a phrase like "traditional style." The "Xi Bei Feng" has played a good role in correcting this weakness, and Zhang Chu's works provide another possibility in a more realistic way. When our "men are sturdy" and "women are simple" ("Grandpa and Grandma's Story"), our music will also stand up, stand firmly.

　　心灵的呐喊
    ——评张楚的《将将将》
    金兆钧
    初次听到《西出阳关》的时候，有一种很兴奋的感觉。之后，我遇见几位流行音乐的词曲作者，他们居然也都一致承认《西出阳关》和《将将将》等的确不同凡响。
    于是，我知道了作者的名字——张楚。然而，当我听到《将将将》后急于寻找他的时候，他却走了，去了西藏。前不久回到北京没有几时，又如他自己的歌：“穿一身粗布衣服你就走了”。这次是下了南方。走前只给一位朋友留了一句话“在北京我受不了”。
    他是一个２０岁的青年，来自西安，也许是终于发现自己只能按自己的方式生活，他从大学里退学了。他“收拾破碎的梦想，背起破旧的行囊，舔着心头的伤口”，“午夜搭一班货车，去流浪”。就这样闯进了北京流行音乐界。但却并未得到一些本该作出反应的刊物编辑和音像编辑的赏识，是《歌曲》编辑部首发了他的《爷爷奶奶的故事》；是吴海岗，这位曾推出了《一无所有》和《让世界充满爱》的编辑立刻拍板，为张楚制作了《将将将》作品磁带专集。
    “他是用心来写音乐”，一位青年作曲家的话说得极好。张楚的歌词与音乐中站着的是一个伤痕累累，然而雄气勃勃的完整的人。我惊异于何种生活给张楚蕴积了如此强劲的心理力量：“在我第一次面对世界的时候，我告诉我，拱卒，过河，冲啊！吃啊！将！将！将！”这是一种结结实实的男人风度，是一种真实的痛苦：“在我回家的那天，面对我自己，我吃我的车，我吃我的马，我吃我的炮，我吃我的心。”
    凝聚在张楚作品中的是一种极深刻的悲剧美。正如吴海岗所说：“‘西北风’实际上多是陕北风，张楚的东西才是‘西北’的。”从音乐素材到词的意蕴，渗透着苍凉慷慨的气势，体现着深远的悲哀。
    张楚的作品绝少人为的雕饰，却于平平淡淡中显示出了动人的魅力：“你说你一人离开家门已经很久，在海边你看见渔家的女儿向大海挥手。沙漠的夜里你望着骆驼眼睛温柔，２０岁时候路旁你见我独自一人坐在门口”（《走吧》）。
    的确，张楚的作品清楚地表现出浑然天成的特点。可以听出，他积累的民间素材极为丰富，还没有很好地雕琢和控制，但它们是实实在在的心灵的呐喊，没有多少明显的理念的干扰，因此反而获得了难以理喻的力量。音乐的力量来源于人的力量。而多年以来，我们的音乐一向缺乏强大的内在力量，这是并非可用一句“传统风格”来抹掉的问题。“西北风”对矫正这种软弱曾起到了很好的作用，张楚的作品则以更为实在的方式提供了另一种可能。什么时候，我们的“男人很结实”，“女人很朴实”（《爷爷奶奶的故事》），我们的音乐也才会站起来，站得实实在在。
