Gong Yu Zhi in his book "The New Starting Point for Ideological Liberation" (published by Hunan People's Publishing House) states that capitalism, on the one hand, is a system of exploitation and oppression; on the other hand, it has seen significant development in productive forces and scientific technology, with substantial progress in the socialization, commodification, and modernization of production. Socialism negates the former aspect while affirming the latter. If, during the revolutionary period, our examination of capitalism focused on the former aspect, then after seizing power and taking on the task of construction, our examination of capitalism should focus on the latter aspect. Lenin's examination of the "Taylor system" had different perspectives before and after the October Revolution.

However, for many years, we have overlooked Lenin's scientific attitude. "Learning from capitalism" seemed to imply deviating from socialism, failing to recognize that this is the necessary path to building socialism. Therefore, today, when we propose to shift our perspective to study capitalism, we should objectively analyze the technical management, labor organization, enterprise operations, and economic mechanisms created by capitalism that meet the requirements of socialized, commodified, and modernized production. We should conduct research, make selections, and apply and develop these methods, so that the socialist public ownership economy, after fully absorbing the civilized achievements created by capitalism, can develop more dynamically and effectively, and more fully demonstrate its superiority.

### 龚育之谈：考察资本主义的新视角

　　龚育之谈：
　  考察资本主义的新视角
    龚育之在他的《思想解放的新起点》一书（湖南人民出版社出版）中说，资本主义一方面是一种剥削和压迫制度；另一方面，生产力和科学技术有了大发展，生产的社会化、商品化有了大发展。社会主义否定它的前一方面，肯定它的后一方面。如果说，在革命时期我们考察资本主义的视角着重在前一方面，那么在取得政权、担负起建设任务之后，我们考察资本主义的视角就要着重在后一方面。列宁对于“泰勒制”的考察，在十月革命以前和十月革命以后就有不同的着眼点、不同的角度。
    可是，多年来我们忽视了列宁这样的科学态度，“学习资本主义”似乎就意味着背离社会主义，而不了解这正是建设社会主义的必由之路。所以，今天重新提出转变视角研究资本主义，应当客观地分析资本主义所创造的适合生产社会化、商品化、现代化要求的技术管理、劳动组织、企业经营和经济运转方法，进行研究、选择，拿来加以运用和发展，使社会主义公有制经济在充分吸收资本主义创造的文明成果后发展得更活、更好，更充分显示出优越性。
