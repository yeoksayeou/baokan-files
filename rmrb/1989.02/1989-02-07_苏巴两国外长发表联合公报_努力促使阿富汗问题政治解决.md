Soviet and Pakistani Foreign Ministers Issue Joint Statement
Efforts to Promote Political Resolution of the Afghan Issue

	ISLAMABAD, Feb. 6 (Xinhua) — Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze said today in Islamabad that the Soviet Union and Pakistan agree that after the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan, "every effort must be made to achieve a political resolution to the Afghan issue."

	Shevardnadze made these remarks at a press conference following his two-day visit to Pakistan. He said that a political resolution is the "only way" to restore peace and stability in Afghanistan and to avoid prolonged civil war.

	The foreign ministers of the Soviet Union and Pakistan also issued a joint statement. The statement said, "The two foreign ministers believe that military means can only exacerbate the situation in Afghanistan, resulting in further loss of life and property across the country." Both sides advocate for "the formation of a broadly-based government through the efforts of the Afghan people themselves."

	Shevardnadze told reporters that his visit had deepened mutual understanding between the Soviet Union and Pakistan. He said, "We believe that Pakistan wants a political resolution to the Afghan issue."

	The foreign minister also emphasized that any plan to exclude the current ruling "Afghan People's Democratic Party" from the future government is unworkable. He said, "The future government must include all factions."

	There are reports that the Afghan resistance forces are preparing to form a consultative committee to handle state affairs after the withdrawal of Soviet troops, but they refuse to include the current ruling People's Democratic Party.

	The Soviet foreign minister also hopes that the United Nations Secretary-General will play a greater and more active role in resolving the Afghan issue.

	In discussing the relationship between the Soviet Union and Pakistan, Shevardnadze stated that the two countries have decided to take steps to develop existing cooperation in the fields of economics, science, and culture.

　　苏巴两国外长发表联合公报
　　努力促使阿富汗问题政治解决
    新华社伊斯兰堡2月6日电　苏联外长谢瓦尔德纳泽今天在此间说，苏联与巴基斯坦一致认为，苏军撤离阿富汗后，必须“尽一切努力以促使阿富汗问题得以政治解决。”
    谢瓦尔德纳泽是在结束对巴基斯坦2天访问时举行的一次有众多记者参加的招待会上说这番话的。他说，政治解决是使阿富汗恢复和平与安定、避免长期内战的“唯一途径”。
    苏联和巴基斯坦两国外长还发表了一份联合公报。公报说，“两国外长相信，军事手段只能使阿富汗的局势更加恶化，结果将使全国蒙受更多的生命和财产损失”。双方主张“通过阿富汗人自己的努力，组成一个有广泛基础的政府”。
    谢瓦尔德纳泽对记者们说，他这次访问，加深了苏巴两国的互相了解。他说：“我们相信巴基斯坦是要政治解决阿富汗问题的。”
    这位外长还强调说，在建立未来政府时，任何排除现执政的“阿富汗人民民主党”的方案，都是行不通的。他说，“将来的政府必须包括所有派别”。
    有消息说，阿富汗抵抗力量正准备在苏军撤离后成立一个负责处理国家大事的协商委员会，但是他们拒绝吸收目前执政的人民民主党参加。
    苏联外长还希望联合国秘书长在解决阿富汗问题上发挥更大的和更积极的作用。
    在谈到苏巴两国关系时，谢瓦尔德纳泽表示，两国已决定采取一些步骤来发展双边现有的经济、科学和文化领域的合作。
