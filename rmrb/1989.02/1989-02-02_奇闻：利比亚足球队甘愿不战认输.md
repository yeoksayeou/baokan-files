According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on February 1, the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA) confirmed on January 31 that the Algerian team won a match in the African zone preliminary round of the World Cup football tournament, Group A, with a score of 2:0 against the Libyan team. The match was originally scheduled to be held on January 20 in Tripoli, Libya. However, before the match began, Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi publicly announced that, to show "brotherly" support for Algeria's stance against the U.S. airstrike on Libya, the Libyan football team would willingly forfeit the match. This decision immediately sparked dissatisfaction among the more than 70,000 spectators present.

FIFA will also consider imposing sanctions on the Libyan football team according to its usual practices.

    新华社北京２月１日电  据外电报道，国际足球联合会１月３１日确认，阿尔及利亚队在没有进行的一场世界杯足球赛非洲区预选赛Ａ组的比赛中，以２∶０胜了利比亚队。
    这场比赛原订１月２０日在利比亚的的黎波里举行，但开赛前，利比亚领导人卡扎菲当众宣布，为表示对阿尔及利亚反对美国空袭利比亚这一立场的“兄弟”之情，利比亚足球队甘愿不战认输。这一决定，当即在７万多观众中引起了不满。
    国际足联还将根据其惯例，考虑制裁利比亚足球队。
