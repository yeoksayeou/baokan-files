The "Nankai Cup" National Amateur Drama and Sketch Competition has opened. According to a report from our Beijing bureau, to promote the popularization of dramatic culture and to encourage amateur creation in the field of drama and sketches, the Cultural Department's Bureau of Cultural Affairs, Central Television, *China Drama* magazine, *Literary Gazette*, Tianjin Television, Tianjin Municipal Bureau of Culture, and the Nankai District Government of Tianjin recently jointly initiated the "Nankai Cup" National Amateur Drama and Sketch Invitational Competition.

Nankai District of Tianjin is where Comrade Zhou Enlai engaged in dramatic activities during the May Fourth period and is one of the earliest sources of dramatic art in China. Naming the competition after Nankai expresses the organizers' good wishes.

The competition rules stipulate that participating sketches must be amateur creations. Except for professional dramatic workers (who may provide guidance), people from all walks of life can sign up to participate. Participating sketches must be newly created works, and the performance time must not exceed 15 minutes.

The preliminary round of the competition will be organized by the cultural administrative departments of each province, municipality, and autonomous region. The semi-finals and finals will be held in Tianjin by the end of July. Central Television will select or broadcast live the finals.
