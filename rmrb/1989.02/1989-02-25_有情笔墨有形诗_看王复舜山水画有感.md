	When viewing the works of painter Wang Fushun, one always feels that his brushstrokes convey a sense of free-spirited emotion and a hazy poetic charm, imbuing ordinary landscapes with extraordinary artistic effects.

	"_Snowy Mountain Sentiments_" is a clear example. The artist's affection lies not only in the rugged lines of the high mountains but also in the ethereal scene after the snowfall, giving viewers a sense of transcendence. However, the artist is not content with this; he loves the world of humans. On the nearby hill, he adds a herd of cows slowly moving, contrasting with the distant snowy mountains, making it clear that despite nature's desolation, it cannot conceal the warmth of human life. This contrast in viewing the scenery is probably the artist's intention.

	"_Bright Moon_" also has a similar mood. The artist, captivated by the soft moonlight, paints the large tree under the moon as a transparent body submerged in water, presenting a crystal world before the audience; this is bold, but it is artistic. Looking further down, on the distant hillside, people are driving cattle and sheep back home. This is the artist's old trick, using a bit of human activity to break through the cold of the night.

	"_Natural Rhythm_" is a different tune. The flat land is like a musical score in the hands of a musician, with two leaping notes on it, which are two reindeer and a large tree. This is probably the natural rhythm the artist feels.

	There is no need to mention "_Forest Love_" and "_Rural Scenery_" again. They are all poems with form, and sentimental readers will naturally appreciate them. I would like to add a sentence here: "Poetry in painting" is a good tradition in our country, and there is no need to deny it. However, in today's world where emotionless brushstrokes frequently appear in galleries, the existence of Wang Fushun's works is particularly precious.

### 有情笔墨有形诗——看王复舜山水画有感

　　有情笔墨有形诗
    ——看王复舜山水画有感
    蔡若虹
    看画家王复舜的作品，总觉得他的笔下流露着一种飘逸的感情和朦胧的诗意，使寻常的画中景色取得了不寻常的艺术效果。
    《雪山情》就是明显的例子；画家情之所钟，不仅仅是高山上那些险峻的线条，还有那落雪以后所特有的一片空灵的景象，令人看了颇有出世之感。然而画家对此并不满足，他热爱人间，他在近处的高坡上添加了徐徐走动的牛群，与远处的雪山相对照，就显得大自然尽管冷僻荒凉，终竟掩盖不了人间的温暖。从对比中看风景，这大概就是画家的本意所在。
    《皎皎月》也有类似的情调，画家为了喜爱溶溶的月色，就把月光下的大树画成浸在水中的透明体，在观众眼前展开一个琉璃世界；这是大胆的，但却是艺术的。再往下看，在极远的山坡上，正有人驱赶着牛羊归来，这是作者的老办法，用点滴的人间活动冲破夜色的寒冷。
    《自然之旋律》是另外一种调子；平坦的大地好像音乐家手中的五线谱，五线谱上有两个跳跃的音符，这就是两只驯鹿和一棵大树。这大概就是画家所感受到的自然的旋律。
    就不必再提《林之恋》和《乡间小景》了，它们都是有形的诗，多情的读者自然会体会到。我在这里想多说一句，就是“画中有诗”本来是我国的好传统，用不着否定；可是当无情的笔墨在画廊中一再出现的今天，王复舜作品的存在，就觉得十分可贵了。
