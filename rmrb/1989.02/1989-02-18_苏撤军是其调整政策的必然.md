The Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan is a positive development and aligns with the current global trend of shifting from confrontation to dialogue, and from tension to relaxation.

Over nine years of evidence has shown that sending troops to invade Afghanistan was a major strategic mistake for the Soviet Union. Although the Soviet Union paid a heavy price with nearly 50,000 casualties and over $300 billion, it failed to achieve its goal of controlling Afghanistan. More importantly, it placed the Soviet Union in a seriously disadvantageous strategic position. The invasion of Afghanistan completely ended the détente between the United States and the Soviet Union in the 1970s and pushed U.S.-Soviet relations to a state of severe confrontation in the early 1980s. It also brought Soviet relations with major Western countries to a new low, severely damaging Soviet relations with most developing countries. Sino-Soviet relations were also adversely affected. In summary, the invasion of Afghanistan had extremely negative impacts on the Soviet Union's politics, diplomacy, and economy.

Since Gorbachev assumed the highest leadership position in the Soviet Union in 1985, the Soviet Union has been working to push forward domestic political and economic reforms while gradually adjusting its foreign policy. The Afghanistan issue was a key focus of this adjustment. A political solution to the Afghanistan issue would help the Soviet Union shift from a passive to an active strategic position, improve relations with the United States and other major countries, and establish a new image of the Soviet Union as committed to reform and détente. Therefore, despite internal and external difficulties, the Soviet Union's insistence on completing the withdrawal on schedule is a wise move that considers the overall situation.

It can be anticipated that with the complete withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan, U.S.-Soviet relations, Sino-Soviet relations, and Soviet relations with Islamic countries will all see significant improvements. This will promote the relaxation of the situation in Asia and even the world, and give the Soviet Union much more maneuvering room in international affairs than before. Clearly, this is very beneficial for the Soviet Union's position in the ongoing transformative changes, and for the Soviet Union to gain political and, especially, economic benefits.

In summary, the complete withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan is a necessary step for the Soviet Union in the face of transformative changes in the international situation, and in adjusting its domestic and foreign policies.

　　苏撤军是其调整政策的必然
    中国国际问题研究中心常务干事  郭震远
    编者按：苏联于２月１５日从阿富汗撤出了它的全部军队，按期兑现了它去年４月承诺的撤军时间表，受到国际舆论的普遍欢迎。这一事态发展对西南亚地区形势和国际关系会产生什么影响，阿富汗国内局势的前景如何，都是人们所关注的。我们特请几位国际问题专家就此撰文笔谈，以供读者参考。
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    苏联从阿富汗撤军是一个积极的事态发展，是顺应当前世界局势由对抗转向对话、由紧张转向缓和的大趋势的。
    ９年多的事实证明，派军队入侵阿富汗是苏联一个重大的战略失误。因为，苏联虽然付出伤亡近５万人和３００多亿美元的重大代价，却未能实现控制阿富汗的目标；更重要的是，它使苏联在战略全局上陷于严重不利的局面。入侵阿富汗彻底结束了７０年代美苏之间一度存在的缓和，并且在８０年代初把美苏关系推到严重对抗的地步。它还使苏联与各主要西方国家的关系又一次降到最低点，严重损害了苏联与大多数发展中国家的关系。中苏关系也受到不利影响，总之，入侵阿富汗对苏联的政治、外交、经济带来了极为不利的影响。
    １９８５年戈尔巴乔夫出任苏联最高领导人以来，苏联在努力推进国内政治、经济改革的同时，开始逐步调整对外政策，阿富汗问题就是调整的重点之一。阿富汗问题的政治解决，有利于苏联在战略全局上变被动为主动，改善与美国及其它主要国家的关系，树立苏联致力于改革和缓和的新形象。所以，苏联面对内外困难，坚持实现按期撤军，是着眼全局的明智之举。
    可以预料，随着苏联军队全部撤出阿富汗，美苏关系、中苏关系、苏联和伊斯兰国家的关系都将得到明显改善，这必将促进亚洲乃至世界局势的缓和，并且使苏联在国际事务中具有较以前大得多的回旋余地。显然，这对于苏联在当前正在发生的转折性变化中的地位，对于苏联获取政治的，特别是经济的实惠都是十分有利的。
    总之，苏联军队全部撤出阿富汗，是苏联面临国际形势转折性变化，调整国内外政策所必然迈出的一步。
