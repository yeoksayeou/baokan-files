West Germany and the U.S. Have Clear Differences on Short-Range Missile Issue
	U.S.: Update First, Then Negotiate
	West Germany: Negotiate First, Then Make a Decision

	BEIJING, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) — According to local media reports today, U.S. Secretary of State Baker recently visited West Germany and clearly stated to Chancellor Kohl and Foreign Minister Genscher that NATO should first make a decision to update its short-range nuclear missiles and then negotiate with the Soviet Union. He hopes that the NATO London meeting in May or June this year will discuss the overall arms reduction plan and give a clear answer to this issue.

	According to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Baker emphasized during the talks that NATO's nuclear deterrence strategy requires the West to maintain an adequate and effective arsenal. If negotiations are started first, it may lead to a third "zero option." West Germany proposed that the NATO foreign ministers' meeting in Reykjavik in June 1987 had already declared that negotiations would be held with the Soviet Union on short-range nuclear missiles. Therefore, one of the most important tasks of the London meeting is to formulate a plan to reduce the short-range missiles of the East and West to a balanced low level. West Germany believes that the Soviet Union will not make new proposals on short-range missiles before the start of negotiations, and if the West initiates negotiations, it will be more proactive.

	According to reports, there are subtle differences within the ruling coalition in West Germany. The leadership of the Free Democratic Party decided at a small meeting on the 12th that no decision will be made on the short-range missile update in 1991 or 1992, even if it leads to a conflict with the Christian Democratic Union. Genscher said that the first consideration should be not to miss the "historic opportunity" to coexist with the Soviet Union, which also brought about the relaxation in Eastern Europe. Chancellor Kohl's attitude is to first seize the opportunity at the negotiating table, and if negotiations fail, it is not too late to update the short-range missiles, but not to pursue a third "zero option."

　　西德美国在短导问题上分歧明朗化    
    美国：先更新再进行谈判　西德：先谈判再作出决定
    本报波恩２月１７日电  记者江建国报道：据此间报刊今天披露，美国国务卿贝克最近访问西德时，向科尔总理和根舍外长明确提出，北约应首先作出短程核导弹更新的决议，然后再同苏联谈判。他希望今年五六月间的北约伦敦会议讨论裁军总体方案时对此作出明确回答。
    据《法兰克福汇报》报道，贝克在会谈时强调，北约的核威慑战略要求西方保持足够和有效的武器库。如果先开谈判，有可能导致第三个“零点方案”。西德提出，北约外长１９８７年６月的雷克雅未克会议已经声明，要与苏联在短程核导弹领域进行谈判，因此伦敦会议的最重要任务之一是制订一项把东西方的短程导弹裁减到一个均衡的低水平上的方案。西德认为，苏联在谈判开始之前不会就短程导弹提出新建议，如果西方率先建议谈判，比较主动。
    据报道，西德执政党联盟内部对此出现微妙差异。自民党领导人１２日在一次小范围会议上决定，１９９１年或１９９２年不对短导更新问题作决定，即使与联盟党发生冲突也在所不惜。根舍说，首先要考虑到不能丧失与苏联共处的“历史性机会”，这一机会也带来了东欧的松动。科尔总理的态度是，首先抓住谈判桌上的机会，谈不成再对短导进行更新不迟，但不搞第三个“零点方案”。
