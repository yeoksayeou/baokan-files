A measure to accelerate labor system reform—unified retirement and pension system for enterprise employees and unified management of retirement and pension funds—has been implemented in Yantai City starting February 1.

Yantai City's reform unifies the retirement and pension system for permanent employees, contract employees, and temporary urban non-agricultural workers. The normal retirement conditions and benefits are as follows: men who are 60 years old, women who are 50 years old, and those who have worked continuously for 15 years or have paid into the retirement and pension fund for 15 years, will receive 70% of their standard salary upon retirement. Starting from the 16th year, an additional 1% will be added for each year, with a maximum of 95%. The retirement and pension fund for employees will continue to be managed on a city-wide basis, uniformly changing to 18.5% of the total wage bill of all employees in the enterprise, and it is decided that the retirement and pension funds for permanent employees, contract employees, and temporary urban non-agricultural workers will be combined.

The unified retirement and pension system for employees has improved the living standards of retired employees and alleviated the concerns of contract employees.

　　提高生活待遇　解除后顾之忧    
    烟台实行职工退休养老一体化
    本报济南电  据齐鲁晚报报道：一项加快劳动制度改革的配套措施——企业职工退休养老制度一体化和退休养老基金统筹一体化，从２月１日起在烟台市首次实行。
    烟台市的这项改革将固定职工、劳动合同制职工和城镇非农业户口的计划内临时工三者的退休养老制度实行一体化。正常退休的条件和待遇是：男年满６０岁，女年满５０岁，连续工龄或交纳退休养老基金的年限满１５年者，退休后按本人标准工资的７０％发给，从第１６年起每满一年加发１％，最高不超过９５％。职工退休养老基金仍实行全市统筹，统一改为按企业全部职工工资总额１８．５％提取，并决定固定工、合同工、城镇非农业户口的计划内临时工的退休养老基金三者合用。
    职工退休养老一体化提高了退休职工生活待遇，解除了劳动合同制职工的后顾之忧。
