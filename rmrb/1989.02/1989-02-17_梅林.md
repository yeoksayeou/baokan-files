	Plum Grove
	Sī Yú

	Back then, we were truly young. Our faces were round and rosy, our skin shiny like it had been oiled. Our bodies were not as slender as they are now, but sturdy. Our round, strong shoulders would take turns bearing loads of over a hundred pounds, which was a daily routine, a common occurrence.

	However, carrying a load of sea mud up the mountain was no easy task. The mountain was very high, the highest within hundreds of miles. The elders revered it, respectfully calling it "Rock God," while the young girls and boys were more casual, simply calling it "Rock."

	It took about two hours to climb the mountain once. We would get up early, carry night soil or sea mud up the mountain, and spread it in the paddy fields at the top. The mountain path was winding and long, like the vast history of humanity. The sea mud would shift from one shoulder to the other, like a mountain, like an anchor, finally pressing down on our shoulders and hearts like Mount Tai.

	Thus, step by step, we experienced life, believing that happiness was not far away, but also knowing it would not be luxurious—for those sweating and panting under heavy loads, walking with empty shoulders and swinging hands on the bustling mountain path was happiness.

	But climbing the "Rock" in early spring later became a delightful pastime for me.

	When I finally felt that my legs were no longer flesh but stiff wooden crutches, unable to take another step, the paddy fields at the top of the mountain were just in front of me. So, with the last of my strength, I threw the mountain-like load into the fields and collapsed heavily onto the embankment.

	Lying down, resting on the green embankment that provided comfort to the laborers. After half an hour, energy gradually returned to my body. My companion Fang'er came over and pulled me up, taking me to explore the "Rock."

	The "Rock" had green cypresses and sweet osmanthus, wild pears and wild peaches. The "Rock" was overgrown with weeds, and the tree shadows were like clouds. Fang'er was very happy, climbing the trees to pick green cypress buds and sweet osmanthus seeds.

	I was still tired, dragging the carrying pole and rope, lazily strolling around.

	Suddenly, a blinding white light startled me—before my eyes appeared a cave, with a few clusters of blooming plum blossoms stretching across the entrance.

	My mind went blank for a moment, and joy seized my heart. I thought I had found a utopian paradise.

	When I bent down and carefully pushed aside the plum blossoms at the cave entrance and entered the cave, I discovered it was neither a paradise nor a cave, but a small, curved, and recessed plum grove.

	I can no longer describe the exact shape of that plum grove. For years, what has firmly occupied my mind is a dazzling, hazy scene.

	The plum trees were peculiar, with a strong spirit, either solemn, wild, proud, or mysterious. Each tree was full of will and personality. In a bright and peculiar brown, waves of pure white undulated and flowed, like clouds gathering, like mist spreading, like fire burning, like waves surging, and like countless little suns in a snowy day, shining and twinkling! Each blossom quietly radiated silver light, emitting brilliance. The small mountain valley was illuminated by thousands of white suns, making it dazzling and hazy...

	Facing this pure and dazzling scene, for some reason, I did not feel the "sublime" and "solemn" that should have been felt in that era. Instead, I thought of a white wedding dress.

	Really, I suddenly had a strong desire to wear a white, flowing wedding dress, walk through this quietly burning plum grove, towards the new home, towards all the unknown realms of life.

	I even yearned for destruction, yearned for eternity. Because eternity is always pure and dazzling.

	Later, when I searched for this dream-like plum grove time and time again, I found it no longer existed.

	To this day, I do not understand whether it was a real existence or just a dream. I also do not understand how, with my purity and devotion at that time, I could have such strange thoughts.

	But that plum grove on the mountain, the dazzling and hazy scene within the plum grove, the sudden intoxication and delirium, are so deeply etched in my memory. Although it has been fourteen years since I left that dreamy season.

    那时候真年轻。脸孔浑圆红润，皮肤亮得如同刷过一层油。身体也不似现在纤细，真棒。圆而结实的双肩轮流担负着百来斤的担子，在那时是家常便饭，是日课。
    但是挑着装满海泥的海枷碇上山去却不是轻松的事。山很高，是方圆几百里最高的那座。阿伯阿婶们敬畏它，恭敬地称它“岩神”，女仔少年家则比较随便，只叫它“岩”。
    上一趟岩差不多两个小时，早早起来，挑粪水，或者挑海枷碇上山，沤在山顶上的水田里。山路蜿蜒，漫长如浩浩的人类历史。海枷碇在两肩来回地换着，似山，似磐，终于越来越如泰山压顶般地压在肩上压在心里。
    就这样一步步地体味人生，相信幸福不再遥远，但也不会富丽堂皇——对于大汗淋漓、上气不接下气的负重跋涉者来说，空着肩，甩着手，在熙熙攘攘的山路上闲逛，便是幸福。
    但早春的时候上“岩”去，后来却成为我向往的赏心乐事。
    当终于觉得两腿已不复是肉体，而是僵硬的木拐，再也迈不动的时候，岩顶的水田正好转到了跟前。于是拚足最后的力气，把山一样的担子甩到田里，人便重重地跌坐在田埂上。
    横着，躺着，苍翠的田埂供给劳作者舒适的眠床。歇了半个时辰，活力渐渐回到体内，我的同伴芳儿过来拉起我，带我去游“岩”。
    “岩”有青柏相思、野梨野桃。“岩”上杂草茂密，树影如云。芳儿很快活，她溜上树去摘青柏蕾，寻相思子。
    我仍是疲惫，拖着扁担绳子，懒洋洋地闲逛。
    忽然一片耀眼的白光使我身心一震——眼前转出一个山洞，洞口横伸着几丛怒放的梅花。
    大脑闪过片刻的空白，惊喜攫住我的心。我想我遇上了世外桃源。
    当我低头弯腰，小心翼翼地拨开洞口的梅花进入山洞后，我发现它既不是桃源也不是山洞，而是一片拐了弯又凹进去的小小的梅林。
    我现在已不能复述那片梅林的具体形状，几年来牢牢占据我的脑海的是一片辉煌的迷蒙。
    梅树怪异，风骨铮铮，或肃穆，或狂放，或傲然，或诡谲。每一株都充满意志，充满个性。一片鲜明而怪异的褐色中，弥漫起伏着连绵的洁白。争妍斗艳的梅花，云一样积聚，雾一样弥漫，似火燃烧，如浪奔涌，又像无数个雪天的小太阳闪闪烁烁！每一朵都静静地放着银辉，吐着光芒，小小的山洼，被万千洁白的太阳照耀得辉煌而迷蒙……
    面对这洁白、辉煌的景象，不知为什么，我没有产生那个时代应有的“崇高”与“庄严”的感觉，只想起雪白的礼服。
    真的，我突然强烈地渴望穿上雪白飘逸的结婚礼服，穿过这片静静燃烧的梅林，走向新居，走向生命所有未知的领域。
    我甚至渴望毁灭，渴望永恒。因为永恒总是洁白而辉煌。
    后来，当我一次次寻找这梦一样的梅林时，我发现它已不复存在。
    我至今不明白它是不是一个真实的存在，抑或只是一个梦。我也不明白以我当时的单纯与虔诚，何以会涌出那些怪异思想。
    但那岩上的梅林，梅林里的辉煌与迷蒙，骤然的陶醉与梦呓，是如此深刻地留在我的记忆里了。虽然算起来，我告别那个多梦的季节已经过去了十四个年头。
