	Soviet Communist Party Central Committee Secretary Ligachov said that ensuring food supply is the primary task of reform.

	According to a report by the New China News Agency in Moscow on February 6, the All-Union Conference on the Development of the Food Complex opened today in Kharkov, Ukrainian SSR. Party, government, and economic department leaders, including Ligachov, chairman of the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee's Commission on Agricultural Policy, attended the meeting.

	Ligachov emphasized that cities should actively participate in the development of agriculture, carry out technical renovations of state farms and collective farms, improve the living conditions of farmers, and make the labor and living conditions in urban and rural areas comparable.

	Nikonenko, deputy chairman of the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee's Commission on Agricultural Policy, also pointed out at the meeting that it is not enough to just make slogans; the people should not always be in a state of waiting. Efforts should be made within the scope of current capabilities to improve food supply. Nikonenko said that when formulating the food production targets for the 13th and 14th Five-Year Plans, the specific tasks of each city, village, and labor collective should be clearly defined. The focus of improving food supply is to improve storage and the deep processing of raw materials.

	Agricultural issues have always been a major concern and an unresolved problem for Soviet leaders. Gorbachev has recently emphasized in multiple speeches that agricultural development and the solution to food problems should be achieved through improving production relations and correct policies. Ligachov, on the other hand, emphasizes improving the production and living conditions in rural areas.

　　苏共中央书记利加乔夫说
　　改革首先要保障食品供应
    新华社莫斯科２月６日电  主管农业问题的苏共中央书记利加乔夫发表讲话说，保障食品供应是改革的首要任务。
    据塔斯社报道，全苏发展食品综合体讨论会今天在乌克兰共和国哈尔科夫市开幕，苏共中央农业政策问题委员会主席利加乔夫等党、政府和经济部门的领导人出席会议。
    利加乔夫强调，城市应积极参与发展农业，对农庄农场进行技术改造，改善农民的生活环境，使城乡的劳动与生活条件相接近。
    苏共中央农业政策问题委员会副主席尼科诺夫也在会上指出，不能只喊口号，也不能让人民总处在等待中，应当在今天力所能及的范围内改善食品供应。尼科诺夫说，在制定第１３和第１４个五年计划的食品生产指标时，要明确各城市、村庄及劳动集体的具体任务。改善食品供应的重点，是改进储存和原料的精加工。
    农业问题一直是苏联领导人着重关心又未能解决的难题，戈尔巴乔夫近来在多次讲话中强调靠改进生产关系，通过正确的政策来发展农业，解决食品问题。利加乔夫则强调改善农村的生产与生活条件。
