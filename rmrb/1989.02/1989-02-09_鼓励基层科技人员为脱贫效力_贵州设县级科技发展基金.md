To fully leverage the role of grassroots technological personnel in developing county-level economies, Guizhou Province has established county-level science and technology development funds. This initiative has supported 27 remote minority counties and counties with weak scientific and technological foundations in conducting research, yielding significant results.

Over 70% of Guizhou's counties rely on national subsidies for their fiscal budgets. In recent years, with the implementation of fiscal contracting, some impoverished minority regions have faced a sharp contradiction between technological development and financial shortages, dampening the enthusiasm of grassroots technological personnel. To address this issue, the Guizhou Provincial Science and Technology Commission started in 1986 to allocate a portion of the science and technology funds annually, adopting a matching approach at the provincial, municipal, and county levels. Over three years, this has resulted in 28 million yuan in science and technology development funds for the 27 supported counties. Each county's science and technology commission manages these funds on a cost-recovery basis, adhering to the principles of "planned guidance, peer review, and selective support." They assist grassroots technological personnel in conducting scientific and technological development and some applied basic research projects tailored to local natural resources and economic development characteristics.

The establishment of county-level science and technology development funds has accelerated local economic development. For instance, the Guiyang County Science and Technology Commission used these funds to support projects such as shortening the aging period of white wine, developing multi-element liquid compound fertilizers, series production and management of poultry farming, and the promotion of scientific pig farming techniques. These efforts have yielded good economic benefits. By the end of September last year, in addition to recovering the entire subsidy, an additional 400,000 yuan in value-added fees was earned. It is understood that over the past three years, the 27 supported counties have arranged 72 science and technology projects, with a total subsidy of over 10.3 million yuan, generating a pure income of over 9 million yuan. This has increased the new sources of science and technology development funds.

　　鼓励基层科技人员为脱贫效力
　  贵州设县级科技发展基金
    新华社贵阳电  （记者龙文彬）为充分发挥基层科技人员在开发县级经济中的作用，贵州省设立县级科技发展基金，先后扶持２７个边远的少数民族县和科技基础薄弱的县开展科研工作，收到了“养鸡下蛋”的效果。
    贵州省７０％以上的县财政长期靠国家补贴，近几年实行财政包干后，一些贫困的少数民族地区遇到了科技发展与经费短缺的尖锐矛盾，挫伤了基层科技人员的积极性。针对这种情况，贵州省科委从１９８６年开始，坚持每年从科技三项费用中挤出一部分资金，采取省、地、县三级匹配的办法，分期分批设立县级科技发展基金。３年来，使被扶持的２７个县科技发展基金达２８０万元。各县科委对这项基金实行有偿使用，本着“计划指导、同行评议、择优支持”的原则，资助基层科技人员结合当地自然资源、经济发展特点开展科技开发和部分应用基础研究工作。
    县级科技发展基金建立起来后，推动了基层科研工作的开展，加速了当地的经济开发。贵定县科委用这项基金，择优支持科技人员开展缩短白酒陈酿期、多元液体复合肥、养鸡系列化生产与管理和科学养猪技术推广等项目技术开发，收到了较好的经济效益，到去年９月底止，除全部收回资助基金外，还获得了４万元的增值费。据了解，受扶持的２７个县科技发展基金３年来共安排７２个科技项目，资助经费１０３万多元，创纯收入达９００多万元，增加了科技发展基金的新来源。
