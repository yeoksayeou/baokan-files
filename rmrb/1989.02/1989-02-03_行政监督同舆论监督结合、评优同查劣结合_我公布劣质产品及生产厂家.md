Administrative supervision combined with public opinion supervision, and excellence awards with quality inspections

We publish substandard products and their manufacturers

Substandard rate of 42.7% in product inspections across ten major cities

Director of the State Bureau of Technical Supervision emphasizes the need to strengthen product quality management

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 2nd - (Reporter: Jiang Zai Zhong) Today, Xu Zhijian, Director of the State Bureau of Technical Supervision, spoke to reporters about the first public disclosure of a batch of substandard products and their manufacturers. He pointed out that publishing the names of substandard products and their manufacturers is to combine national administrative supervision with social public opinion supervision, and to combine excellence awards with quality inspections. This aims to prompt enterprises producing substandard products to correct their business thinking, strengthen product quality management, and voluntarily protect consumers' interests.

Xu Zhijian said that publishing the names of substandard products and their manufacturers is a measure taken based on the opinion of State Councilor Song Jian. Comrade Song Jian recently pointed out that typical cases found in product quality inspections should be disclosed. This not only benefits the supervision of market product quality but also can closely link technical supervision work with the national economic life.

Xu Zhijian said that this batch of substandard products and their manufacturers was disclosed based on the results of a product quality inspection conducted in ten major cities before the Spring Festival. This inspection of product quality in ten major cities has significantly improved the inspection methods compared to previous ones. Instead of directly taking samples from the factory's finished product warehouse or production line, samples were taken from market sales points. The inspectors did not have any contact with the manufacturers throughout the process, and the manufacturers did not know whether their products were being inspected. This eliminated various forms of intervention and administrative interference, and the inspection results were more accurate, objective, and fair.

Xu Zhijian said that from the results of this inspection, the quality problems of some consumer goods are quite serious. Out of the 1,764 samples inspected, 753 were found to be substandard, with a substandard rate of 42.7%. This shows that we must strengthen product quality management and persistently improve product quality supervision.

Xu Zhijian said that the purpose of publishing substandard products and their manufacturers is to combine national administrative supervision of products with social public opinion supervision. By disclosing substandard products, consumers will have a basis for choosing goods, and substandard products will not be able to pass off as good ones. This will put pressure on manufacturers through social public opinion, prompting them to make decisions to rectify and improve, and raise product quality.

Director Xu Zhijian said that the substandard products disclosed this time are only a part of the inspected products, and there are still many counterfeit products that need to be further investigated before they can be disclosed. In the future, we will gradually establish the practice of inspecting and disclosing substandard products, continuously inspecting and disclosing. Not only will we disclose the names of substandard products, manufacturers, and factory directors, but we will also disclose the names of units and responsible persons involved in the sale of substandard products.

He said that product quality is a major issue concerning the survival of enterprises and the interests of consumers. We must attach great importance to it and effectively manage it. The State Bureau of Technical Supervision hopes that through the combined supervision of national administrative supervision and social public opinion supervision, and the dual management of excellence awards, rewards, and quality inspections, penalties, we can effectively promote the continuous improvement of the quality of various products in our country.

　　行政监督同舆论监督结合、评优同查劣结合
    我公布劣质产品及生产厂家
    十大城市商品抽查不合格率达百分之四十二点七
    国家技术监督局局长强调必须加强产品质量管理
    新华社北京２月２日电　（记者姜在忠）国家技术监督局局长徐志坚，今日就首次公布一批劣质产品及生产厂家对记者发表谈话，指出，公布劣质产品及生产厂家名单，是为了把国家行政监督同社会舆论监督结合起来，把评优与查劣结合起来，以促使那些生产不合格产品的企业，端正经营思想，切实加强产品质量管理，自觉维护消费者利益。
    徐志坚说，公布劣质产品及生产厂家名单是根据国务委员宋健的意见而采取的加强质量监督的措施。宋健同志最近指出，对商品质量抽查中发现的典型案例要予以公布。这不仅对监督市场商品质量有好处，也可以使技术监督工作同全国经济生活紧密联系起来。
    徐志坚说，这批劣质产品及生产厂家，是根据春节前十大城市市场商品抽查结果公布的，这次十大城市商品质量抽查，在检查方法上比以前有较大改进。没有像以往那样直接到工厂成品库或生产线上抽取样品，而是到市场销售点抽取样品，检查人员自始至终不和生产厂家进行任何接触，生产厂家也不知道自己的产品是否受检，这样就排除了种种说情和行政干扰，完全根据检测数据来评断优劣，检查结果是比较准确、客观、公正的。
    徐志坚说，从这次抽查的情况看，当前一部分消费品存在的质量问题是比较严重的，抽查受检的１７６４个样品中，不合格的达７５３个，不合格率达４２．７％，这说明我们必须要大力加强产品质量管理，坚持不懈地把产品的质量监督工作抓好。
    徐志坚说，这次公布劣质产品及生产厂家的目的，是为了把国家对产品的行政监督同社会舆论监督结合起来，把劣质产品公布出来，消费者选购商品就有了依据，劣质产品就不能鱼目混珠，使生产厂家受到社会舆论的压力，促使他们下决心整顿改进，提高产品质量。
    徐志坚局长说，这次公布的劣质产品，只是被抽查商品中的一部分，其中还有不少假冒产品须待进一步查清后才能公布。我们今后要将商品检查和公布劣质产品的做法逐渐形成制度，不断检查，不断公布。不仅公布劣质产品名、厂家和厂长名，还要公布经营劣质产品的单位和负责人的名。
    他说，产品质量是事关企业生存和消费者利益的大事，我们必须十分重视，切实抓好。国家技术监督局希望通过国家行政监督和社会舆论监督相结合的综合监督及评优、奖优和查劣、罚劣相结合的双向质量管理，切实促进我国各类产品质量不断提高。
