	Grain production has decreased, the population is increasing, arable land is diminishing, and soil fertility is declining. Finding a way out of the predicament and seeking development for agriculture, especially grain production, has become a difficult problem for the party and government decision-makers in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. Recently, nearly 100 experts and scholars from the natural sciences and social sciences in Guangxi proactively discussed this issue. They sat together with government leaders, each expressing their views, resulting in mutual enlightenment for both parties.

	Last year, the region's grain production decreased by 1.65 billion kilograms, and the per capita grain availability has dropped to below 300 kilograms. More worrying is that the population is still increasing, arable land is still decreasing, and soil fertility is still declining. It will not be easy to significantly increase grain production in the future. This determines that in Guangxi, where per capita arable land is less than one mu, it will be a long-term and arduous task to focus on developing grain production.

	It is on this basis that the criticisms and suggestions put forward by the experts have enlightened and been warmly received by the leaders of the autonomous region: Guangxi's agricultural, especially grain, development needs a long-term strategy, striving to avoid significant fluctuations; it cannot be complacent during good harvests, ignoring the issue, and only seeking solutions passively when there is a poor harvest. The experts also pointed out that currently, rural reforms are stagnant, rural work is often neglected, rural economic research is weak, agricultural technology promotion is powerless, agricultural development goals are unclear, and rural governance is paralyzed in many places. The root cause of this situation lies with the leadership.

	The following suggestions, driven by a sense of responsibility, were also immediately adopted by the government leaders: Organize a large number of agricultural science and technology personnel to go to the countryside, select and train a large number of farmer technical teams, and turn science and technology into an active productive force for increasing grain production.

	After listening to the experts' opinions, the chairman of the regional government, Wei Chunshu, openly shared his thoughts, detailing the government's macro-planning for agricultural issues. This, in turn, inspired the experts. They felt that, constrained by their specialties, their considerations, though professional, were sometimes narrow-minded and lacked the macro perspective of the leaders. In the future, they should pay attention to broadening their horizons.

　　粮食减产　人口增加　耕地减少　地力下降
　　广西邀集近百专家寻农业出路
    本报南宁电  记者郑盛丰报道：农业特别是粮食如何从困境中找出路、求发展，已成为广西壮族自治区党政决策者面前的一道难题。前不久，广西近百名自然科学和社会科学两界的专家、学者主动研讨这一问题。他们与政府领导人同席商议，各抒己见，结果使双方互受启发。
    去年，该区粮食减产１６．５亿公斤，人均有粮已跌到３００公斤以下。令人不安的还在于：人口仍在增加，耕地仍在减少，地力仍在下降，今后粮食要大幅度增产并非轻而易举。这就决定了在人均耕地不足一亩的广西，重视发展粮食生产将是长期的艰巨任务。
    正是在这个基点上，专家们提出的一些批评、建议，使自治区政府负责人受到启发并欣然“纳谏”：广西农业特别是粮食的发展要有一个长远战略，努力避免大起大落；不能丰年时高枕无忧，不闻不问，歉收了才“急时抱佛脚”，被动寻对策。专家们还指出，现在，农村改革处于滞缓状态，农村工作日受轻视，农村经济研究薄弱，农业科技推广无力，农业发展目标不明，农村政权多处瘫痪。出现这种状况，根源在领导。
    专家们受责任感驱使提出的下述建议，也当即被政府领导人采纳：组织大批农业科技人员下农村，选拔和培训人数众多的农民技术员队伍，让科学技术变成粮食增产的活跃生产力。
    区政府主席韦纯束听取了专家们的意见后，开诚布公地交心交底，将政府对农业问题的宏观筹划一一道来，这又反过来使专家们受到启发。他们感到，为专业所囿，自己考虑问题虽有专业特色，但有时失于狭隘，不如领导者那样富于宏观眼光。今后，须注意拓宽视野。
