Lin Xianshun, a former Taiwan Nationalist Party Air Force major who flew back to the mainland, spent a few days in his ancestral hometown of Meizhou City, Guangdong Province, from February 22 to 24.

Lin Xianshun visited the Meixian Airport, Jiaoying University, and Meizhou Pharmaceutical Factory in Meizhou City. He said, "I used to think Meizhou City was a very small place, but now that I've seen it for myself, it's not small at all. The place is much better than I imagined. It's not just a land of fruits; it also has abundant mineral resources. Seeing all these handicrafts and daily necessities produced here, and the well-equipped schools and the 200-year-old Meizhou Pharmaceutical Factory, it truly makes one happy."

Lin Xianshun also visited schools and factories built with the donations of overseas Chinese.

    林贤顺在梅州市参观了梅县机场、嘉应大学和梅州制药厂。他说，以前以为梅州市是个很小的地方，现在实地一看一点也不小。这里比我以前想象的好多了，不仅是水果之乡，矿产也这么丰富。看到这里生产的工艺品、日用品这么多，这么好，看到条件优越的学校和有２００年历史的梅州制药厂，真令人高兴。
