    Before the Spring Festival, a reporter drove from Nanjing, passing through Yangzhou, Jingjiang, Suzhou, Wuxi, Yixing, and Zhenjiang, and returned to Nanjing. The roads were smooth, the vehicles were moving well, and the once troublesome road traffic safety in Jiangsu Province has significantly improved under the unified management of the provincial public security organs.

    At the end of 1987, when road traffic safety began to be managed by the Jiangsu Provincial Public Security Bureau, the number of motor vehicles in the province increased rapidly, and traffic accidents remained high for four consecutive years, with a death rate exceeding 20%. There were more than 1,300 traffic congestion points, and some road sections experienced traffic jams lasting eight to nine hours, seriously affecting national production and life.

    Chen Wen, the director of the Jiangsu Provincial Public Security Bureau, and four deputy directors went to the front lines of traffic management to conduct investigations and research, formulate rectification plans, and propose the goal of "reducing accidents and ensuring smooth traffic." They transferred police officers from other departments of the public security organs to strengthen the traffic police force, recruited 2,000 contract traffic police officers, and established 200 traffic management stations along national and provincial highways. In 391 towns, traffic management stations were established, forming an initial traffic management network that combines points, lines, and surfaces. They also implemented the "three fixes and one guarantee" system, which involves assigning specific personnel, road sections, and responsibilities to ensure safety and smooth traffic. They promptly corrected violations, cleared obstructions, and strictly managed the roads. Last year, eight main lines in the province had 103 fewer deaths from traffic accidents compared to 1987, and traffic police promptly cleared 496 major congestion incidents.

    The Jiangsu Provincial Public Security Bureau, in collaboration with relevant departments, cleared up markets, stalls, illegal constructions, and piled-up items that occupied roads and affected traffic, restoring smooth traffic to some disorderly and congested towns and road sections. They also focused on solving the long-standing problem of occupying roads for threshing and drying grain.

    The Jiangsu Provincial Public Security Bureau actively carried out multi-channel, multi-level, and multi-form traffic safety propaganda and education activities to enhance the public's legal awareness and traffic safety consciousness. At the same time, they strictly adhered to standards and closely monitored the training, examination, inspection, and certification of drivers and motor vehicles. In addition, the provincial public security organs placed great importance on the construction of the traffic management team, frequently conducted education on clean governance, published various management regulations and work systems, set up hotlines and supervision boxes to increase the transparency of traffic management, and voluntarily accepted legal, public opinion, and public supervision. According to incomplete statistics, traffic police across the province refused bribes 4,528 times and received 2,849 letters of praise.

　　建立网络　严格管理    
    江苏道路交通安全明显好转
    本报讯  记者孙健报道：春节前夕，记者驱车从南京出发，沿扬州、靖江、苏州、无锡、宜兴、镇江公路转了一圈回到南京，一路车辆畅通，车速良好，曾令人头疼的道路交通安全在江苏省公安机关的统一管理下有了明显的好转。
    １９８７年底，道路交通安全开始由江苏省公安机关统一管理时，全省机动车辆成倍增加，连续四年交通事故居高不下，死亡率超过２０％以上；交通堵塞点有１３００多处，有的路段一次堵车长达八、九个小时，交通安全严重妨碍国民生产和生活。
    江苏省公安厅厅长陈文章和其他四位副厅长分头到交通管理第一线调查研究，制订整治方案，提出了“压事故，保畅通”的奋斗目标。从公安机关其他部门抽调干警充实加强交通民警队伍，招收合同制交通民警２０００余人，在国道、省道公路沿线组建了２００个交通管理所，在３９１个乡镇组建了交通管理站，全省初步形成了点、线、面结合的交通管理网络。并采取定人、定路段、定责任、包安全畅通的“三定一包”岗位责任制，及时纠正违章，疏通阻塞，严格路面管理。去年，省内８条主干线上交通事故比１９８７年少死１０３人，交通民警及时疏通较大堵塞４９６次。
    江苏省公安机关还会同有关部门对占用道路影响交通的集贸市场、摊点摊贩、违章建筑和堆放物品逐个进行清理，使一些秩序混乱，堵塞严重的集镇、路段恢复了畅通。重点解决了占用道路打场晒粮的老大难问题。
    江苏省公安机关还积极开展了多渠道、多层次、多形式的交通安全宣传教育活动，增强群众的法制观念和交通安全意识。同时，对驾驶员的培训、考核、机动车的检验、发牌发证，以及经常性的安全管理坚持标准，严格把关。除此之外，省公安机关还把交通管理队伍自身建设放在重要位置，经常开展为警清廉的教育，将各项管理规定和工作制度公布于众，设立举报电话和监督箱，提高交通管理的透明度，自觉接受法律、舆论以及人民群众的监督。据不完全统计，全省交通干警拒礼拒贿４５２８人次，收到各种表扬信２８４９件。
