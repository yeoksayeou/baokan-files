The general manager of the Taiwan Zhonghua Book Company, Xiong Jie, recently revealed that as early as last September, the Taiwan Zhonghua Book Company signed a letter of intent with the mainland Zhonghua Book Company in Beijing. The two sides can prioritize book selection for publication, and if the copyright of any book published by either side is infringed upon, the local Zhonghua Book Company can take legal action on behalf of the other.
