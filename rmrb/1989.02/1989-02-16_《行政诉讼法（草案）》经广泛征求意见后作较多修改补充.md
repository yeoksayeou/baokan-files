Today, the sixth session of the Standing Committee of the Seventh National People's Congress heard a report by Wang Hanbin, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Director of the Legislative Affairs Commission, on the revision of the Administrative Litigation Law (Draft).

Wang Hanbin said that since the draft was published, it has been widely consulted, and several special meetings have been held to discuss and revise the draft article by article. It is generally believed that the main contents of the draft are feasible, and many suggestions for revision and supplementation have been put forward. The Legislative Affairs Commission, based on the opinions of the Standing Committee members and the opinions of various places and sectors, has made many revisions and supplements to the draft on issues such as the scope of acceptance, whether regulations can be used as the basis for administrative litigation trials, issues related to filing and acceptance, trial issues, judgment issues, and that the basic procedures of the Administrative Litigation Law should be made as complete as possible.

The original draft had 7 chapters and 49 articles, which has now been revised to 10 chapters and 68 articles. This revised draft will be deliberated by the Standing Committee and then submitted to the second session of the Seventh National People's Congress for deliberation.
