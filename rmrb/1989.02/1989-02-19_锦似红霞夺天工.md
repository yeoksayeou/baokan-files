In the Anshun region of Guizhou, where 350,000 Buyi people reside, when people talk about Buyi ethnic crafts, they often mention wax printing, brocade weaving, and Diy opera masks as the most renowned.

About 50 kilometers east of Anshun, we arrived at Huangla Buyi Township. Although this place is remote, it is somewhat famous for having more than ten skilled craftsmen who make Diy opera masks. Among these, the village of Liubao is the best. Buyi Township head Luo Xingguo led us into Liubao Village. From the quiet village, we could faintly hear the sound of wood carving. Following the sound, we pushed open a gate and indeed found a family making Diy opera masks. In one corner of the courtyard, there were stacks of large round logs. Two middle-aged men were bent over two halves of a round log, carving masks with sharp blades.

Looking at the characters they were carving, most of them had bared teeth, wide eyes, high nostrils, and fierce expressions. It turned out that these were not Diy opera masks but Nuo opera masks. Nuo opera originated from an ancient ritual to drive away ghosts and diseases, depicting the content of driving away and catching ghosts, so the masks are mostly fierce, like the ghost-catching Zhong Kui. This made people feel that these masks, despite their ferocity, also exuded a sense of heroism and friendliness, making one deeply admire the Buyi artisans' superb craftsmanship. On the walls of the main hall in the two brothers' home, there were hanging masks of another style, with delicate knife work, lively images, rich expressions, and all wearing high crowns and phoenix headdresses. The two brothers introduced these as Diy opera masks. Anshun Diy opera is known as the "living fossil of Chinese drama," with many performances based on historical "great transmissions." The two brothers were carving characters from "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" and "Tale of the Sui Dynasty." They used different knife techniques—some sharp, some soft, some rough, some fine, some masculine, some feminine—to accurately portray different characters, genders, and personalities, truly astonishing. This unique folk art of the Buyi people has been revived with the restoration of cultural life in the local countryside and has become popular with the development of cultural exchanges, transforming from entertainment items into artworks and commodities, attracting attention from both domestic and international audiences. In 1987, at the 20th National Tourism Products Exchange Fair, Anshun Diy opera and masks won a first-class award; in 1986, they caused a sensation at the 50th International Art Festival in France; last year, at the mask theater research activity held at the University of London, they became the focus of cameras. Diy opera masks have now moved from village stages into art halls and cultural markets, with some being exhibited, some being collected, and some being sold as souvenirs. This has also brought corresponding income to Buyi farmers making Diy opera masks, with an average annual income (from this alone) of over 2,000 yuan. Once the artistic value of these masks is known to more people, the artistic potential of the Buyi people will have a broader scope for development.

If Buyi men add luster to the nation with their carving of Diy opera masks, then Buyi women make the Buyi crafts famous with their skill in wax printing and brocade weaving.

We went to the famous "Buyi Wax Printing Village"—Shitouzhai, about 10 kilometers northeast of Huangguoshu Waterfall.

In the winter off-season, Shitouzhai is the busiest time for wax printing and brocade weaving. Almost every household has one or two women sitting at the door, drawing patterns on white cloth, and every courtyard has blue-dyed cloth hanging to dry. Watching them hold wax knives, dip them in melted wax from a charcoal brazier, and carefully but skillfully draw on the white cloth, without needing a base drawing, they draw circles and squares, angles and edges, making the patterns look ancient and elegant. It is said that they often use the patterns from the bronze drums that have been passed down for thousands of years in the village, showcasing the Buyi women's traditional artistic cultivation and exquisite skills.

Almost all Buyi women in Shitouzhai and the surrounding Xiandangshan area know the skills of wax printing, brocade weaving, and embroidery.

In recent years, the most significant change in Buyi wax printing, brocade weaving, and embroidery is that they have moved out of the closed, self-made, self-used form and entered the market. Shitouzhai's party secretary, Wu Qiguang, told us that in the entire village of over 200 households, 98% of the families know how to do wax printing, brocade weaving, and embroidery. Usually, one-third of the families take their products to the market to sell, and during the farming off-season, more than half of the families go to the market. On market days, the market in the Xiandangshan area has a whole "street" selling wax printing, brocade weaving, and embroidery products. The vision of Buyi women has shifted from small stone houses to a larger market. They sell the part of their products that are not for personal use in rural and urban markets, and to county-run or privately-run wax printing factories and clothing factories, which then sell or process them into handkerchiefs, tablecloths, curtains, scarves, and clothing, and re-enter the market. Although the primitive manual processing method affects mass production, Shitouzhai has still increased a source of income. A woman in this village can earn over 1,500 yuan a year just from wax printing cloth.

When people stand before the Huangguoshu Waterfall, marveling at its "white water like cotton, no need for a bow to shoot flowers, naturally scattered, red clouds like brocade, no need for a shuttle to weave, heaven's skill," and see groups of Buyi women dressed in indigo-dyed wax-printed cloth, adorned with colorful brocade, holding beautifully embroidered wax-printed ethnic bags for sale, it is as if they see patches of red clouds rising in the mist of the splashing waterfall. These red clouds from Shitouzhai and other Buyi villages make one want to change the poem to "brocade like red clouds, Buyi people's skill surpasses heaven's craftsmanship."

　　锦似红霞夺天工
    本报记者  邹大毅
    在有３５万布依族人居住的贵州安顺地区，提起布依族的民族工艺，人们就告诉我们，要数蜡染、织锦和地戏面具最负盛名。
    由安顺东去约５０公里，我们到了黄腊布依族乡。这里虽地处偏僻，但因为有十多个做地戏面具的好手，远近也小有名气。其中又数六宝村为佳。布依族乡长罗兴国带我们进入了六宝村。从寂静的村寨中隐约传来一阵削木声。我们循声而去，推开一家院门，果然是一家做地戏面具的。院落中一角堆满大圆木，两个中壮年男子正俯身在两截半爿圆木上，用利刃刻着面具。
    看他们所刻的人物形象，大多龇牙咧嘴、怒目圆睁、鼻翼高耸、面目狰狞。原来，这还不是地戏面具，而是傩戏面具。傩戏源于古代一种驱鬼逐疫的祭仪，表现的是驱鬼捉鬼的内容，难怪面具多狰狞，有如捉鬼的钟馗的形象。这使人反倒觉得这些面具于狰狞中又透出几分英武与亲善来，不禁令人十分钦佩布依族艺人鬼斧神工的高超技艺。在两兄弟家中，堂屋的墙上挂满了另一种风格的面具，刀法细腻，形象生动，表情丰富，且全是峨冠凤顶。两兄弟介绍说，这些就是地戏面具。贵州安顺地戏有“中国戏剧活化石”之称，多以历代“正历大传”为题材。两兄弟刻制的正是《三国演义》和《说唐》中的人物。他们以或刚、或柔、或粗、或细、或阳、或阴的不同刀法，分别准确地表现出不同身份、不同性别和不同性格的人物，简直令人叹为观止。布依族这种独特的民间工艺，随着当地农村中文化生活的恢复而复苏，随着文化交流的发展而走红，从娱乐品转化为工艺品和商品，为中外所瞩目。１９８７年第２０届全国旅游产品交流会上，安顺地戏及面具获得了一等奖；１９８６年在法国第５０届国际艺术节上引起轰动；去年在伦敦大学举办的面具戏剧研讨活动中，又成为照相机争相拍摄的对象。地戏面具目前已从乡村戏台走进了艺术的殿堂和文化市场，有送展的，有收藏的，也有作为旅游品销售的。这使做地戏面具的布依农民也获得了相应的收入，一般年收入（仅此一项）在２０００元以上。一旦这些面具的艺术价值为更多的人所知晓，布依族蕴藏的艺术潜力将会有更广阔的用武之地。
    如果说布依族男子以雕刻地戏面具为民族添了光彩，那么布依族妇女则以精于蜡染、织锦而使布依族工艺名闻遐迩。
    我们在离黄果树瀑布东北１０公里处，走进了著名的“布依蜡染之乡”——石头寨。
    冬闲时节的石头寨，正是蜡染、织锦的忙碌时节。寨里几乎家家门口都坐着一两个妇女，正在白色坯布上绘制着图案，家家院落里都晾晒着一匹一匹已经染好的靛青色布匹。看他们手持蜡刀，蘸着炭盆中融好的蜡液，往白色坯布上细心而熟练地绘来，也无须绘底图，便绘得有圆有方，有棱有角，图案显得古朴典雅。据介绍，她们多以寨中流传了千年的铜鼓上的纹饰为图，展现出了布依妇女传统艺术的修养和技艺的精湛。
    石头寨以及这个寨子所在的扁担山区，几乎所有的布依族妇女都会蜡染、织锦、刺绣的手艺。
    这几年，布依族蜡染、织锦、刺绣最显著的变化就是从自做自用的封闭形态中走出了寨门，走向了市场。石头寨的支部书记伍起贵告诉我们，全寨子２００来户人家，９８％的人家都会做蜡染、织锦、刺绣，平时有１／３的家庭把产品拿到市场上出售，到农闲时，就有半数以上的家庭走上市场。一到赶场天，扁担山区的场子上，光卖蜡染、织锦、刺绣产品的就形成了“一条街”。布依族妇女的目光已经从小小的石头房子投向了更大的市场。她们把自用部分以外的产品投向了农村城镇的集市，投向了县办或私人办的蜡染厂、服装厂，由他们销售或加工成手巾、桌布、窗帘、围巾、服装，再投入市场。尽管原始的手工加工方式影响着批量生产，但石头寨仍然增加了一个财源。这个寨子一个妇女一年光蜡染布的收入就达到１５００元以上。
    当人们在“一溪悬捣，万练飞空”的黄果树瀑布前，赞叹它“白水如棉不用弓弹花自散，红霞似锦何须梭织天巧成”时，看到一群群身穿靛青蜡染布、镶嵌着五彩织锦的服装的布依妇女，手持着用彩色丝线绣成精美花纹的织锦的蜡染民族挎包在兜售，就好像看到一片片彩霞在瀑布飞溅起的雾霭中升腾起来。这来自石头寨、来自其它布依村寨中的彩霞，使人不禁要将那诗句改为“锦似红霞布依人巧夺天工”。
