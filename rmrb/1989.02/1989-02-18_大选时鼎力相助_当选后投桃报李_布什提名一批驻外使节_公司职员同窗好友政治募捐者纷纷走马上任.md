After taking office, U.S. President Bush has successively nominated a batch of ambassadors to important countries. Although some of them have no diplomatic experience, they have contributed significantly to Bush's presidential campaign and thus "deserve" this "political reward."

According to the U.S. government, the position of U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom, one of the most important diplomatic posts, will be held by Henry Catto, a vice chairman of a telecommunications company who donated a large sum of money to Bush's election campaign.

The position of U.S. Ambassador to France, traditionally seen as a "plum job," will be held by Walter Curley. Curley is a college friend of Bush's brother Prescott and has a 50-year relationship with the Bush family. Curley was a major fundraiser for the Republican Party in the New York area during Bush's election campaign.

Peter Secchia, a member of the Republican National Committee, helped Bush defeat his opponent Pat Robertson in Michigan during the Republican presidential nomination process, earning Bush's favor and securing the position of U.S. Ambassador to Italy.

The nominee for U.S. Ambassador to Spain is real estate developer Joseph Zapata, who donated $100,000 to Bush's election campaign and raised an additional $25 million.

The position of U.S. Ambassador to Luxembourg will be held by Frederick Bush, who has no blood relation to the president but served as the deputy chairman of Bush's election committee in charge of finances.

Those nominated to be U.S. Ambassadors to Australia, Melvin Semmes, and New Zealand, Della Newman, have also made significant contributions to Bush's presidential campaign.

The new president appointing his campaign aides to be ambassadors as a form of reward has become a tradition in American politics. Over time, people have become accustomed to this practice and no longer find it unusual.

　　大选时鼎力相助　当选后投桃报李    
    布什提名一批驻外使节
    公司职员同窗好友政治募捐者纷纷走马上任
    新华社华盛顿电  （记者陆文岳）美国总统布什就职后，陆续提名了一批驻重要国家的使节。尽管其中一些人毫无外交经历，但由于他们在布什竞选总统过程中出过大力，由此便“当之无愧”地享受到这一“政治酬报”。
    据美国政府透露，美驻英国大使这一最重要的职位将由为布什竞选活动捐过巨款的一家电信公司副董事长亨利·卡托担任。
    历来被视为“肥缺”的驻法国大使一职将由沃尔特·柯利出任。柯利与布什的兄弟普雷斯科特是大学时代的同窗好友，与布什家族有着５０多年的交情。柯利在布什竞选期间是共和党在纽约地区的主要募资人。
    共和党全国委员会成员彼得·塞基亚在共和党总统提名时帮助布什在密歇根州击败了对手帕特·罗伯逊，因而受到布什的青睐，这次将出任驻意大利大使。
    被提名担任驻西班牙大使的是土地开发商瑟夫·萨帕拉，他为布什的竞选活动捐献了１０万美元，同时还募集到２５００万美元。
    驻卢森堡大使将由弗雷德里克·布什担任，他与布什总统没有血缘关系，曾担任布什竞选委员会负责财务的副主席。
    将担任驻澳大利亚大使的梅文尔·塞姆勃勒以及驻新西兰大使德拉·纽曼都曾为布什登上总统宝座立下过汗马功劳。
    新总统委派其竞选功臣担任驻外大使作为一种论功行赏的“政治酬报”，这已成为美国官场上的一大传统。久而久之，人们对这种做法也就习以为常，见怪不怪了。
