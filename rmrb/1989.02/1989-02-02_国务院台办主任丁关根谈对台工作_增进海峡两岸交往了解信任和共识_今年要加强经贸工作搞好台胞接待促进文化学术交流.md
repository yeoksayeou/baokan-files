Ding Guangren, the Director of the State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office, has been in his position for three months. He recently held his first press conference. He stated: he and his colleagues will work hard to achieve "increased exchanges, increased understanding, increased trust, and increased consensus" across the Taiwan Strait.

On the morning of January 30, at a press conference held at the State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office, 59-year-old Ding Guangren emphasized in response to reporters' questions: We will resolutely implement the central government's policy towards Taiwan, advocating "one country, two systems," peaceful reunification, revitalizing China, and opposing the creation of "two Chinas" and "one China, one Taiwan." Regarding the differences between the two sides, he said: "We can sit down and talk, and resolve issues through consultation."

Ding Guangren summarized the work plan for the State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office for this year into three aspects: first, strengthening economic and trade work with Taiwan; second, further improving the reception of Taiwanese compatriots; third, promoting exchanges in the fields of academia, culture, sports, and science and technology.

Before Ding Guangren answered the reporters' questions, Sun Xiao Yu, the Deputy Director of the State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office, introduced the situation of cross-strait exchanges over the past year: In 1988, 450,000 Taiwanese visited the mainland for various purposes, including visiting relatives, tourism, and exchanges. Currently, 389 people from the mainland have been approved to go to Taiwan for visiting sick relatives or attending funerals. The total trade volume between the two sides increased from $1.6 billion in 1987 to $2.4 billion in 1988. Additionally, maritime routes have been opened between Taiwan and the mainland. Moreover, 1.4 million letters were sent from Taiwan to the mainland, and over 2 million letters were sent from the mainland to Taiwan. Exchanges in culture, academia, sports, and other fields have also significantly increased. Through these exchanges, compatriots on both sides, who have been separated for nearly forty years, have reconnected, especially Taiwanese who have personally witnessed the magnificent landscapes and socialist construction achievements of their motherland, understanding the development of the motherland and the vast market on the mainland, and strengthening their affinity towards the mainland.

During the three-hour press conference, Ding Guangren focused on the issue of economic and trade work with Taiwan. He said that the mainland has resources, a market, labor force, and considerable technological strength. Taiwan has capital, commercial networks, and talented managers. Mutual cooperation benefits both sides. Some Taiwanese businessmen have seen that the investment conditions in the coastal areas of the mainland are the best, where there is not only a high-quality labor force but also the same language and similar customs, which are very convenient. To promote the development of cross-strait economic and trade relations, it is being considered to set aside a piece of land in the development zone of the coastal special economic zones for Taiwanese businessmen to develop and invest. We are also studying methods to improve the situation where Taiwanese businessmen find it difficult to navigate the mainland. He emphasized that trade with Taiwan should be conducted on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, and reciprocity, gradually moving towards standardization, normalization, and orderliness, and developing from indirect trade to direct trade.

Regarding the reception of Taiwanese compatriots, Ding Guangren stressed the need to improve service quality. When talking about cross-strait exchanges, he revealed that this year, two conferences, "Confucian Studies Discussion" and "Chinese Culture and Chinese Unification Seminar," will be held, inviting renowned figures from Taiwan and overseas to participate.

Ding Guangren used the words "relaxed" and "passive" to describe the attitude of the Taiwan authorities in handling cross-strait relations. He believes that the Taiwan authorities have shown some relaxation in their policy towards the mainland over the past year, but this relaxation is conditional and quite passive, with some aspects being unreasonable and illogical. He gave examples, such as allowing original Taiwanese veterans to settle in Taiwan but not allowing them to visit relatives, and stipulating that they cannot bring minor children. Another example is that they invite famous figures from the mainland to visit Taiwan but stipulate that Communist Party members are not allowed to enter Taiwan, and invite guests with conditions attached. Furthermore, they do not allow direct mail communication, require maritime routes to be connected through a third party, do not allow direct trade, and must go through a third party, resulting in increased costs and leakage of benefits.

Ding Guangren pointed out that the facts have proven that promoting cross-strait exchanges benefits both sides, and both sides' people have this desire, which cannot be stopped.

　　国务院台办主任丁关根谈对台工作
    增进海峡两岸交往了解信任和共识
    今年要加强经贸工作搞好台胞接待促进文化学术交流
    新华社北京２月１日电  （记者端木来娣）丁关根出任国务院台湾事务办公室主任三月有余，日前首次约见记者。他表示：他和他的同事们将努力工作，使海峡两岸“增进交往，增进了解，增进信任，增进共识”。
    １月３０日上午，在国务院台湾事务办公室举行的记者座谈会上，５９岁的丁关根在回答记者的提问时强调：我们将坚决执行中央对台工作的总方针，即主张“一国两制”，和平统一，振兴中华，反对制造“两个中国”和“一中一台”。至于两岸的分歧，他说：“问题嘛，大家可以坐下来谈，协商解决”。
    丁关根将国务院台湾事务办公室今年的工作打算概括为三个方面：一，加强对台经贸工作；二，进一步做好台胞接待工作；三，促进两岸学术、文化、体育、科技等领域的交流。
    在丁关根回答记者提问之前，国务院台湾事务办公室副主任孙晓郁介绍了一年来海峡两岸交往情况：１９８８年赴大陆探亲、旅游、进行各种交流活动的台湾民众达４５万人次，目前大陆已有３８９人获准去台探病奔丧。两岸贸易总额由１９８７年的１６亿美元增至１９８８年的２４亿美元。同时，台湾和大陆之间在海上已开辟航线。此外，台湾寄往大陆的信件有１４０万件，大陆寄往台湾的信件达２００多万件。两岸在文化、学术、体育等方面的交往也显著增多。通过交往，隔绝近四十年的两岸同胞重叙亲情，特别是台胞亲眼目睹了祖国的壮丽河山和社会主义建设成就，了解了祖国的发展和大陆的广阔市场，增强了对大陆的向心力。
    在三个多小时的记者座谈会上，丁关根着重谈了对台经贸工作问题。他说，大陆有资源、市场、劳动力，并拥有相当的科技实力。台湾方面有资金、商业网络，还有善于经营管理的人才，互相合作，对双方都有好处。有些台商看到了在大陆沿海地区投资条件最佳，那里不仅有较高素质的劳动力，而且语言相同，习惯相近，有诸多方便。为了推动两岸经贸关系的发展，现在考虑在大陆沿海特区的开发区内划出一块地方，由台商来进行开发和投资。我们也正在研究办法，以改善台商到大陆“找不对路”的状况。他强调，对台贸易要在平等互利和互惠基础上进行，逐步做到规范化、正常化、秩序化，从间接贸易向直接贸易发展。
    关于台胞接待工作，丁关根强调，主要是提高服务质量。谈到两岸交流时，他透露：今年将先后举办“孔学讨论会”和“中国文化和中国统一研讨会”，邀请台湾和一些海外知名人士参加。
    丁关根用“松动、被动”这四个字来形容台湾当局在处理两岸关系方面的态度。他认为，台湾当局在大陆政策上一年来确有松动的一面，但这种松动是有条件的，而且相当被动，有些地方不近人情，不合情理。他举例说，比如，他们只许原台籍老兵去台定居，但不许去台探亲，而且规定不准带未成年的子女。又如他们邀请大陆知名人士去台访问，但又规定不许共产党员入台，邀请客人，还附带条件。再如，通信不让直接通邮，通航要经第三地接驳，通商不准直接贸易，非得经第三者转手不可，结果费用提高，肥水外流。
    丁关根指出，事实证明，促进两岸交流对双方都有好处，而且两岸民众都有这个愿望，想挡是挡不住的。
