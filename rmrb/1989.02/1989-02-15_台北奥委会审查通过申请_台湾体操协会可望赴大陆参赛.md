Taipei Olympic Committee Approves Application for Taiwan Gymnastics Association to Compete in Mainland China

	TAIPEI, Feb. 14 (Xinhua) -- The Taipei Olympic Committee yesterday approved the application by the Taiwan Gymnastics Association to participate in the Asian Youth Gymnastics Championships to be held in Beijing in late April. The application has been sent to the Taiwan "Ministry of Education" for review.

	The Taipei Olympic Committee's review panel concluded that the Taiwan Gymnastics Association's application met all the requirements, including the invitation letter, competition rules, registration forms, and the association's participation plan. However, the association emphasized that it would use the English name "CHINESE TAIPEI" for the competition and not the Chinese translation.

	It is understood that the deadline for registration for the Asian Youth Gymnastics Championships is March 10.

	In addition to the Taiwan Gymnastics Association, other sports associations such as badminton, archery, and judo have also applied to participate in competitions to be held in mainland China.

    中新社香港２月１４日电  台北消息：台北奥委会昨天审查通过台湾体操协会赴大陆参加４月下旬在北京举行的亚洲青年体操赛的申请，该申请并送台湾“教育部”审核。
    台北奥委会审查小组认为，台湾体协申请内容符合一切规定，包括比赛邀请函、竞赛规程、报名表、体协参加计划等，不过体协强调赴大陆参赛只使用英文ＣＨＩＮＥＳＥＴＡＩＰＥＩ”名称，而不用中文译名。
    据悉，亚洲青年体操锦标赛报名截止日期是３月１０日。
    与台湾体操协会同时申请赴大陆参赛的还有台湾羽毛球、射箭、柔道等协会。上述项目的比赛也将在大陆举行。
