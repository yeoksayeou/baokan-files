A budding flower was cut short, leaving people with a sense of deep regret. She was the 12-year-old child star Heather O'Rourke.

At the age of 5, Heather O'Rourke accompanied her mother to the MGM movie studio to support her sister in filming a movie. She was spotted by director Steven Spielberg, who cast her as the little girl kidnapped by ghosts in "Poltergeist," earning her praise. She then went on to star in the sequel "Poltergeist II: The Other Side," thus gaining the reputation of being a talented actress and becoming a recognized child star.

Unfortunately, fate was cruel. During the filming of the third installment "Poltergeist III," she often felt nauseous and her feet began to swell. She was diagnosed with Crohn's disease. Doctors prescribed her anti-worm medication and used steroids and sulfur to "kill germs." She managed to endure until the film was completed.

However, her condition soon worsened, ultimately proving fatal. It turned out she had intestinal obstruction, leading to septic shock, which caused heart and lung failure and was misdiagnosed.

Now, her mother has filed a lawsuit against the court, seeking compensation.

　　童星之死
    小祥
    一枝含苞待放的花蕾夭折了，给人们留下了一片惋惜。她就是年仅１２岁的童星希花奥露姬。
    ５岁那年，希花奥露姬同妈妈一起陪姐姐来米高梅影片公司拍戏，被导演斯皮尔伯格看中，伴演《鬼驱人》中被鬼绑架去的小女孩而赢得赞誉，于是又接演了续集《鬼追魂》，从此获得“会演戏”的评价而成为公认的童星。
    不料，天有不测风云。在开拍第三集《鬼缠身》时，她常常感到反胃作呕，双脚也开始浮肿，被医生诊断为克隆氏肠炎。医生给她吃打虫药，并用强的松和硫磺替她“杀菌”。就这样，她一直坚持到影片拍完。
    但不久即病情加剧，终至救治无效。原来她患的是肠梗阻，导致败血休克，引起心肺衰竭而被延误。
    如今她母亲已向法庭起诉，要求赔偿。
