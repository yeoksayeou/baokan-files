China is often described as having abundant natural resources, but what is the actual status of its mineral resources on a global scale? According to data from the Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources, China has discovered 162 types of minerals, with proven reserves of 148 types. The resource complementarity is relatively high, and the potential value of proven mineral reserves ranks third in the world.

Although China is a major resource country in terms of total mineral resources, the per capita resource ownership is less than half of the world average, ranking 80th in the world. The current production of minerals also cannot meet the needs of construction.

　　我矿产资源在世界地位如何？
    储量潜在价值列前茅  人均拥有量实在很少
    本报讯  记者朱剑红报道：我国素有地大物博之说，矿产资源在世界上到底居于何种地位呢？据地矿部资料表明，我国现已发现矿产１６２种，探明储量的矿产１４８种。资源配套程度较高，探明矿产储量的潜在价值居世界第三位。
    虽然我国从矿产资源总量上看是世界上的资源大国，但人均资源拥有量不及世界平均水平的一半，居世界第８０位。现有矿产的产量亦不能满足建设需要。
