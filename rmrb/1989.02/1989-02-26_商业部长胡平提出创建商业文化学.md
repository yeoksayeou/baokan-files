Minister of Commerce Hu Ping has proposed the establishment of commercial culture studies. Hu Ping stated that commercial culture studies involve the culture permeating various processes, products, and industries in the commercial circulation sector. It is an interdisciplinary field. By industry, tea has tea culture, alcohol has alcohol culture, and many famous poems in the Tang Dynasty were inspired by drinking; in the Qing Dynasty, snuff was popular, leading to the development of snuff bottle craftsmanship, which combines tobacco with culture; gourmets are a product of China's high-level food culture; elegant fashion shows are a manifestation of fashion culture; service also has its culture (such as photography). Excellent and noble commercial services reflect the cultural and psychological qualities of commercial workers.

Hu Ping pointed out that products are carriers of culture throughout the entire production and circulation process. For example, packaging has cultural elements; good packaging can stimulate consumers' purchasing desire. There are also advertising culture, display window culture, and counter culture. Traditional temple fairs are also a form of combining culture and products. In summary, commercial culture is extensive and rich in content, making it a scientific field that requires thorough research.

Hu Ping believes that the establishment of commercial culture studies is necessary as the commercial economy develops. Currently, many people emphasize money and gold, seemingly downplaying the importance of ideological and political work. This is incorrect. Improving spiritual civilization and spreading commercial culture are indispensable parts of ideological and political work.

Hu Ping particularly emphasized that the establishment of commercial culture studies should have Chinese characteristics, integrating traditional culture, modern culture, and Western culture organically.

　　商业部长胡平提出创建商业文化学
    胡平说，商业文化学就是渗透在商业流通领域各个过程、各种商品、各行各业里的文化，它是一门边缘性科学。按行业分：茶有茶文化，酒有酒文化，唐诗中有不少名句是饮酒之作；清代吸鼻烟，形成鼻烟壶工艺，把烟与文化连在一起了；美食家是中国高水平饮食文化的产物；高雅的时装表演，就是时装文化；服务也有文化（如摄影）。优良高尚的商业服务体现了商业工作者的文化素质包括心理素质。
    胡平指出，商品是个载体，在生产和流通的全过程中都有文化。比如包装就有文化，好的包装可以刺激消费者的购买欲，其他还有广告文化、橱窗文化、柜台文化……传统的庙会也是一种文化和商品结合的形式。总之，商业文化涉及面很广，内容十分丰富，是需要很好研究的一门科学。
    为什么要建立商业文化学，胡平认为，商品经济越发达，商业文化也越丰富，创建商业文化是商品经济发展的需要。现在不少人讲钱本位、金本位，好像思想政治工作不重要了，这是不对的，精神文明素质的提高，传播商业文化也是思想政治工作中不可缺少的一部分。
    胡平特别强调建立商业文化学要有中国特色，商业文化应将传统文化、现代文化、西方文化有机地结合起来。
