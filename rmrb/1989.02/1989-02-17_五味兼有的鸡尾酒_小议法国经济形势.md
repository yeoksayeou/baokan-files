French people generally love to drink, and cocktails are their beloved beverage. Last year, France's economic performance was relatively good, but it was not all rosy, which can be likened to a cocktail with five flavors. According to the French National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies, France's economic growth rate in 1988 was 3.5%, better than the original forecast, and the highest since 1976. The inflation rate was 3%, slightly lower than the previous year's 3.1%. Since the 1973 oil crisis, unemployment has been France's number one social problem and a focal point of debate among political parties. Last year, for the first time, the unemployment rate showed zero growth. The year created approximately 170,000 jobs, equal to the number of young people entering the labor market. These achievements are indeed commendable, but France's foreign trade deficit last year accumulated to about 30 billion francs, comparable to the previous year, reaching what Prime Minister Rocard described as the "limit of what France can tolerate."

How to analyze this economic situation? Different factions in France have different interpretations from different perspectives. For example, one side argues that it is due to the implementation of privatization, tax cuts, price liberalization, and free exchange of foreign currencies, which are liberal policies that have stimulated the enthusiasm of enterprises and individuals, resulting in such outcomes. The other side emphasizes that the Socialist Party government had already adjusted its economic policies in 1983, and since then, the French economy has gradually shown signs of improvement, and so on. In fact, the French economy showed positive signs in 1988. One reason is the relatively favorable international economic environment, and the other is that the austerity policies implemented in France since 1983 have taken effect.

The financial crisis of "Black Monday" in October 1987 objectively produced an "educational effect," guiding mobile capital from "financial adventures" to "industrial adventures." Interest rates began to decline, promoting the development of consumption and increasing productive investment. According to the OECD's "Economic Outlook" semi-annual publication, all major industrial countries have experienced economic growth to varying degrees. Economic growth in various countries, increased demand, and promoted international trade, which in turn further stimulated the economic growth of industrial countries. In 1988, France's industrial orders increased by 8.5%. Additionally, the decline in energy prices is another factor. France's expenditure on energy imports in the first 10 months of last year was 15 billion francs less than the same period the previous year.

France's economic recovery, apart from favorable international economic factors, is more significantly influenced by domestic factors. Entering the 1970s, France, like other Western industrial countries, fell into a state of "stagflation" characterized by high inflation, high unemployment, and low economic growth. In May 1981, the Socialist Party came to power and initially adopted expansionary policies to stimulate consumption and increase employment, attempting to stimulate investment and achieve economic growth, but it was not successful. The franc was forced to devalue twice. After June 1982, the Socialist Party government decisively shifted to implementing austerity policies, including freezing wages and prices, reducing public expenditure, encouraging exports, and restricting imports. In 1984, especially after the Chirac government was formed in March 1986, while suppressing consumption, corporate profits tax was reduced several times, thereby lowering production costs for enterprises, increasing retained funds, and enabling enterprises to have more funds for reinvestment. In 1988, France's personal consumption growth rate was 8%, and productive investment increased by 9%. Due to increased orders, the operating rate reached 85%, and the French economy showed a bright prospect of "after the gloom, a new village appears." Additionally, the Chirac government's privatization policy brought in 67 billion francs for the national treasury, improving the country's fiscal situation. The economic trends of these years in France show that, in a certain period, implementing austerity policies to balance total demand and total supply is a bitter medicine to curb inflation. More investment and more output are fundamental ways to revitalize the economy.

According to a forecast by a French research institute, France's economic improvement trend is fragile this year. Facing the prospect of the European single market in 1992, the French people can carefully taste the five-flavored cocktail of their economy. However, looking at the world, which countries have economies as sweet and lingering as fine wine?

　　五味兼有的鸡尾酒
    ——小议法国经济形势
    张祝基
    法国人一般都爱喝酒，鸡尾酒是他们珍爱的杯中物。去年法国经济成绩较好，但也并非一片玫瑰色，似可喻为一杯五味兼有的鸡尾酒。据法国全国统计和经济研究所披露，１９８８年法国经济增长率为３．５％，好于原先的预计，创１９７６年以来的最高纪录。通货膨胀率是３％，也略低于上一年的３．１％。自从１９７３年石油危机以来，失业成为法国的头号社会问题，也是各政党争论的焦点之一，去年第一次实现了失业率的零增长。全年创造的就业机会约有１７万个，等于进入劳动市场的青年数。上列各项成果固然不错，但去年法国外贸逆差累积约３００亿法郎，同上一年不相上下，已到了如罗卡尔总理说的法国“能够忍受的边缘”。
    如何分析这种经济形势？法国国内各派从不同的立场和角度作出不同的评说。例如，一方说，是由于实行了私有化、减税、物价自由、外汇兑换自由等自由主义政策，调动了企业和个人的积极性，才获得这样的结果。而另一方则强调，社会党政府早在１９８３年就调整了经济方针，从那以后法国经济就逐渐出现好转势头，等等。其实，１９８８年法国经济出现了好势头，一是受益于比较有利的国际经济环境，再是从法国国内讲，自１９８３年开始的紧缩政策取得了成效。
    １９８７年１０月“黑色星期一”的金融危机，在客观上产生了一种“教育作用”，引导流动资金从“金融冒险”转向“工业冒险”，利率开始降低，促进了消费的发展和生产性投资增加。据经合组织的《经济展望》半年刊称，各主要工业国家都有幅度不等的经济增长。各国经济增长，需求增加，带动了国际贸易，反过来又进一步促进了各工业国的经济增长。１９８８年，法国工业制成品的订货就增加了８．５％。另外，能源价格下跌也是一个因素。法国去年头１０个月进口能源的开支比前年同期就节省了１５０亿法郎。
    法国经济开始走向复兴，除了国际经济环境的有利因素之外，其国内因素更形重要。进入７０年代以后，法国同其他西方工业国一样，陷于“两高一低”（高通货膨胀、高失业、低经济增长）的滞胀状态。１９８１年５月社会党上台执政，先采取刺激消费、增加就业的扩张政策，企图以此刺激投资，实现经济增长，但是并没成功。法郎被迫两次宣布贬值。１９８２年６月以后，社会党政府坚决地转为实行包括冻结工资和物价、压缩公共开支、鼓励出口限制进口等措施在内的紧缩政策。１９８４年，尤其是１９８６年３月希拉克政府组成以后，在抑制消费的同时，几次降低企业盈利税，从而使企业生产成本降低，资金留存增加，使企业有更多的资金投入再生产。１９８８年，法国个人消费增长率为８％，生产性投资１９８８年增加了９％。由于订货增加，开工率达８５％，法国经济出现了“柳暗花明又一村”的光明景象。另外，希拉克政府推倒国有化实行私营化，使国库多收入了６７０亿法郎，改善了国家财政状况。这几年法国经济走势说明，在一定时期实行促使总需求与总供给的平衡的紧缩政策，是遏制通货膨胀的一副苦口良药。而多投入并且也多产出更是振兴经济的根本途径。
    据法国一家研究所预报，今年法国经济好转势头脆弱。面临１９９２年欧洲统一大市场的前景，法国人可以仔细品评其经济的五味鸡尾酒。不过，话再说过来，遍观世界各洲，究竟有哪些国家其经济如回味绵长的甜葡萄酒呢？
