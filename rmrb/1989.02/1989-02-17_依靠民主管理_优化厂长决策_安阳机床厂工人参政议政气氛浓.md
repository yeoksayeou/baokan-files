The Anyang Machine Tool Factory in Henan Province has improved its management by establishing a democratic management network, leading to a turnaround in its operations. In 1988, the factory's per capita profit increased by 26% compared to the previous year. Among national key machine tool enterprises, this factory ranked in the top 10 in 18 economic indicators.

The Anyang Machine Tool Factory is one of the key enterprises in the machine tool industry under the Ministry of Machinery and Electronics. In the past few years, the factory's leadership team was not cohesive, and four factory directors were replaced within five years, leading to a decline in production. Upon taking office, the new factory director, Zhang Xuedian, focused on improving the enterprise's democratic management system and decision-making procedures. He clearly stated that the workers' congress has the powers of discussion and recommendation, approval, evaluation and supervision, and democratic consultation. Additionally, the factory established a management committee and a labor dispute arbitration group, both of which include worker participation, and set up eight specialized committees within the workers' congress.

After implementing these reforms, the workers' congress first conducted an evaluation of all department heads and above on their "moral character, ability, diligence, and achievements." Thirty-five incompetent officials were identified, and the factory's personnel department made appropriate adjustments and handled each case individually.

To enhance workers' enthusiasm for political participation, the factory organized workers to study the national regulations on the work of directors of state-owned enterprises, the work of party committees, and the regulations of the workers' congress. In conjunction with the election of new representatives, 230 workers with good political standing, technical expertise, management skills, and the courage to participate in politics were elected as worker representatives. They proposed 312 suggestions regarding enterprise management, product development, technological upgrades, and labor protection and welfare, thus preventing economic losses due to poor decision-making.

　　依靠民主管理　优化厂长决策    
    安阳机床厂工人参政议政气氛浓
    本报讯  河南安阳机床厂健全民主管理网络，企业经营出现转机。１９８８年人均创利比上年增长２６％，在全国重点机床工具企业中，这个厂有１８项经济指标排在前１０位。
    安阳机床厂是国家机械电子工业部机床行业重点厂家之一。前几年这个厂领导班子不团结，５年内更换了４任厂长，企业生产很不景气。新厂长张学田到任伊始，从完善企业民主管理制度和民主决策程序入手，明确提出职工代表大会具有审议建议权、审议通过权、评议监督权和民主咨议权等，并建立了有职工参加的工厂管理委员会、劳动争议仲裁小组，并在职代会内部建立了８个专门委员会。实行上述改革后，职代会首先对全厂科室以上干部进行“德、能、勤、绩”评议，对３５名不称职干部，由工厂人事部门逐一进行了调整、处理。
    为了提高工人议政、参政的积极性，这个厂组织职工学习国家颁布的全民所有制企业厂长工作条例、党委工作条例和职工代表大会条例，结合代表换届选举，有２３０名思想好、懂技术、会管理、敢议政的工人当选为职工代表。他们就企业经营管理、产品开发、技术改造、劳保福利等，提出了３１２条提案，避免了因决策失误造成的经济损失。
