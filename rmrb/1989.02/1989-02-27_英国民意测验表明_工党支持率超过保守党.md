	British polls show
	Labour Party support exceeds Conservatives

	Our London correspondent Chen Te'an reports: Local newspapers today published the results of two opinion polls, indicating that the Labour Party has surpassed the ruling Conservative Party in support.

	The Observer reported the results of a Harris Research Center poll, showing that the Labour Party received 42% support, while the Conservative Party received 41%. In January, the Labour Party had only 37% support, while the Conservatives had 47%.

	This is the first time since 1983 that the Labour Party has achieved 42% support in an opinion poll, and it is also the first time since October 1986 that the Labour Party has led the ruling Conservative Party in an opinion poll.

	The Observer believes that the government's unpopular measures in the National Health Service, rising inflation, public concerns over high interest rates, the poll tax, and the privatization of the water supply system, as well as the Labour Party's recent improvements in London and southeastern England, are the main reasons for the Conservative Party's lagging behind the Labour Party in this opinion poll.

　　英国民意测验表明
    工党支持率超过保守党
    本报伦敦２月２６日电  记者陈特安报道：此间报纸今天公布的两项民意测验结果表明，工党获得的支持率超过了执政的保守党。
    《观察家》报公布的哈里斯研究中心的民意测验结果表明，工党得到了４２％的支持率；保守党是４１％。而在１月份，工党只得到３７％的支持率，保守党则是４７％。
    这是自１９８３年以来，工党第一次在民意测验中得到４２％的支持率，也是自１９８６年１０月以来工党第一次在民意测验中领先于执政的保守党。
    《观察家》报认为，政府在国民卫生服务方面某些措施不太受欢迎，通货膨胀率上升，人们对高利率、人头税和供水系统私有化也有疑虑，而工党近来在伦敦和英国东南部地位有所改善。这是保守党在这次民意测验中落后于工党的主要原因。
