    新华社马德里２月９日电  伊朗外长阿里·阿克巴尔·韦拉亚提９日在西班牙首都马德里宣布，伊朗将在近日内单方面释放２６０名伊拉克战俘。
    韦拉亚提外长在此间举行的记者招待会上同时还宣布，伊朗还将对“手上没有沾上血迹的恐怖分子”实行大赦。
    他指出，伊朗是在伊斯兰革命１０周年之际采取这些措施的。
    韦拉亚提外长８日抵达马德里，并会见了西班牙领导人。
    新华社联合国２月９日电　伊拉克副总理兼外长塔里克·阿齐兹９日说，伊拉克已作好准备与伊朗“进行面对面对话”。
    他是在与联合国秘书长德奎利亚尔会谈后会见记者时说这番话的。现在两伊外长都在纽约与秘书长会谈。
    他说，对联合国秘书长为实施安理会５９８号决议而作出的任何新建议他都将表示赞同，并将“随时接受秘书长关于重新对话的邀请”。
    联合国秘书长１０日将向阿齐兹提交一项解决两伊争端的新倡议。当被问到对两伊和谈的看法时，他说，“从过去６个月的经历来看，没有足够的理由表示乐观。但是，我们决心要达成协议。”
