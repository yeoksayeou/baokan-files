Title: Under the Locust Tree

I have been working as a private school teacher in Zhang Jia Village for some time now.

There is an old locust tree at the village entrance, its rough trunk pockmarked with countless scars, bearing witness to the passage of time. People say that the old locust tree holds countless stories of joy and sorrow, separation and reunion, making it an unwritten history book of Zhang Jia Village.

At dusk, the setting sun paints the earth in a beautiful glow. After a day's hard work, the villagers return home, and they often see an old woman with gray hair and wrinkled face, walking unsteadily towards the locust tree. She leans on a cane, shielding her eyes with her hand as she gazes into the distance. Whenever she sees a figure approaching, her cloudy old eyes light up with a glimmer of hope. As the person gets closer, she shakes her head, sighs, and then stretches her neck, mouth slightly open, standing still as she continues to gaze into the distance. When she gets tired, she sits down, knitting while she waits, until nightfall, when she leaves reluctantly.

She does this every day, rain or shine, without fail. I often encounter her during my evening walks.

“Grandma, what are you looking for?” I ask, puzzled.

“My husband,” she replies, without turning her head. “Do you see anyone on the road wearing a black padded jacket and carrying a gun?”

“There’s no one on the road,” I say, looking far into the distance, seeing nothing. “Who is this person?”

“My husband, Hua Shanshan.”

“Where did he go?”

“My parents were killed by the Japanese devils right under this locust tree. At the time, I had just been married for less than a month. I was so angry that I sent him to join the army to fight the Japanese. We parted under this locust tree. He only had a black padded jacket on. The wind had already started blowing, but I hadn’t finished knitting his sweater. The times were so chaotic, and people couldn’t find peace. It’s also my fault for being lazy, letting him go with just a black padded jacket…” She trails off, talking to herself.

I fall silent. From that time to now, fifty years have passed. These fifty years of wind and rain must have been an incredibly long time for a childless widow in a remote village. In the West, fifty years of marriage is a golden anniversary. I don’t know what to call fifty years of waiting for a husband and living with him in one’s imagination. In the past, she would have been praised for her loyalty. How much has she sacrificed for this unwavering love?

It has started to snow, and the old locust tree is covered in a pristine white coat.

I go to visit the old lady, and she is shoveling snow at the door, her hands red from the cold, her breath freezing in the air. She tries to stand up to greet me but slips and falls. I quickly help her back into the house.

Inside, there is almost nothing. Just a water jar and a clay stove wrapped in iron wire. The walls are stained and the paper ceiling is sagging, looking like a pregnant woman’s belly. I am deeply moved, and my eyes well up with tears.

The old lady is ill, and no one knows. One evening, I don’t see her under the locust tree, so I go to her house. She is dragging her emaciated body to the window, calling out over and over again:

“Hua Shanshan, I’ve finished knitting your sweater. Why don’t you come back to wear it? Why haven’t you come back? Have you forgotten me?”

She has been leaning against the window like this, month after month, year after year, wearing down the brick window sill until it is uneven.

She has a whole box of yarn, enough to knit ten sweaters. Unfortunately, it has all been eaten by moths, and she doesn’t even know.

I am going to the city and come to say goodbye.

“You are a good child,” she says, holding my hand tightly. “Grandma is waiting for you to come back. I have always been afraid of parting, but my husband has been gone for fifty years.” Saying this, tears well up in her eyes.

　　槐树下
    郭建生
    我来到张家庄当民办教员好些日子了。
    村口有棵两人合抱的老槐树，粗糙的树身千疮百孔，那是饱经风霜的见证。听人说，老槐树藏着许多人间悲欢离合的故事哩，是一部张家庄的无字史书。
    黄昏，瑰丽的晚霞映照大地。辛劳了一天的乡亲散工回家，总见槐树下走来一个花白头发、满脸皱纹、一步三晃颤巍巍的老太太。她拄着拐杖，手搭凉棚向前方眺望，每当视野里出现人影时，浑浊的老眼便闪出一点希望的火光。来人走到跟前，她总是摇摇头，叹口气，尔后伸长脖子，微张着嘴，一动不动地继续眺望。累了就坐下来，一边搓毛线一边等，直到天黑，才怏怏离去。
    她天天如此，风雨无阻，从不间断。我晚饭后散步，总碰到她。
    “老奶奶，您望什么呀？”我不解地问。
    “瞭我丈夫。”她听了，头也不扭一下，“你看看，道上是不是来了个穿黑夹袄的人？手里拿着枪。”
    “路上没有人呀！”我极目远望，什么也看不到。“老奶奶，这人是谁？”
    “我丈夫化善。”
    “他去哪儿啦？”
    “我爹妈被日本鬼子刺死了，就在这棵槐树下。那时我新婚不满月，气愤不过，就送他参了军，去打东洋鬼子。我们是在槐树下分手的，他走时，只穿件黑夹袄。都起风了，毛衣还未织，世道太乱，叫人不得安宁。也怪我手懒，让他只穿件黑夹袄就走了……”最后是自言自语。
    我沉默了。从那时到现在，五十个年头过去了。这风风雨雨的五十年，对于还未生育过的山村孤寡妇人来说，该是多么漫长的岁月啊！在西方，五十年的夫妻算金婚，我不知道整日等待丈夫并与他在想象中生活了五十年该属何种婚姻。倘在过去，是可以立牌坊的。她为这忠贞不二的爱情，付出了多大的牺牲呢？
    下雪了，老槐树披上了洁白的新装。
    我去看老太太，她正在门口铲雪，双手冻得通红，嘴里的呵气都在眉间结了霜。她站起来想同我打招呼，不慎摔了一跤。我赶忙将她扶回屋里。
    屋里没什么摆设。只一口水缸和一个一碰就会摔八瓣的外围用铁丝箍着的泥火炉。墙壁斑斑驳驳，纸糊的顶棚离开横木整体凸下来，乍看像个孕妇的肚子。我感慨万分，心酸得直掉眼泪。
    老太太病了无人知晓。有一天黄昏时我在槐树下没看到她，到她家去，她正拖着骨瘦如柴的身子扒在窗台上一遍遍地深情地呼唤：
    “化善，为妻早把毛衣织好了，你回来穿吧。你怎么还不回来，难道把为妻忘了？”
    她扒着，月月年年，青砖砌成的窗台被磨得凹凸不平。
    她的毛线整整搓了一纸箱，织十件毛衣也用不完。可惜全让虫蛀了，她一点也不知道。
    我要进城了，去跟她道别。
    “你是个好孩子啊，奶奶等着你回来”，她抱着我的手不放，“我这一生最怕离别，可丈夫一去就是五十年。”说着说着，眼里又噙满了泪水。
