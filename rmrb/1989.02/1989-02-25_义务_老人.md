The "Volunteer" Elder

Comrade Dong Gan retired from the military in 1980 and returned to his hometown in Guantian Village, Qixiang Township, Shuyang County, Jiangsu. Now that Dong is retired, how does he spend his time?

	The Volunteer Mail Carrier

After returning to his village, Dong discovered that the township postal service only delivered newspapers, magazines, and letters to the village committee, with no one responsible for distributing and delivering them. As a result, some newspapers, magazines, and letters would remain at the village committee for days, even up to ten days. Dong took it upon himself to volunteer as a mail carrier. Every day, when the township postal worker delivers newspapers, magazines, and letters to the village committee, Dong would pack the necessary items into a self-made small mailbag and walk from house to house, delivering them to the recipients. Whether it was extreme cold or heat, or windy and rainy weather, he never stopped. Over eight years, Dong volunteered to deliver 40,000 newspapers and magazines, 4,200 letters, 210 telegrams, and 1,008 remittance notices, without any errors.

	The Volunteer Repairman

After the implementation of the responsibility system, the village acquired more than 20 walk-behind tractors. While many villagers could drive these tractors, few knew how to repair them. Dong was skilled in repairing agricultural machinery. Over the years, whenever someone's machinery broke down, he would go to help fix it. During the autumn planting season last year, one of the village's tractors broke down on the road outside the village. The driver tinkered with it for half a day but couldn't fix it. Upon hearing this, Dong rushed over without even finishing his dinner. After checking, he found that the diesel engine had a problem and worked through the night to repair it, only finishing the next morning. The driver, seeing Dong covered in oil and with red eyes from lack of sleep, specially bought 20 yuan worth of cigarettes and candies to give him. Dong declined. Over eight years, Dong has volunteered to repair various types of agricultural machinery more than 200 times for villagers inside and outside the village.

	The Volunteer Mediator

A young farmer from Guantian Village went to work as a carpenter at the Taizhou Fish Net Factory and later moved his household registration to Dongjiao Township in Taizhou City, securing a stable grain ration. This young man felt his status had improved and began to argue with his wife about divorce. Dong heard about this and visited the young man's home multiple times to criticize and educate him. Dong also wrote letters to the civil affairs assistant in Dongjiao Township, Taizhou City, requesting assistance in doing the young man's ideological work. After the young man had a change of heart, Dong wrote multiple letters to the Taizhou Fish Net Factory and the Dongjiao Township People's Government, asking them to help arrange the young man's wife in a township-owned enterprise in Dongjiao Township, so that the couple could live together. Since his retirement, Dong has volunteered to mediate more than 20 disputes over marriage, land boundaries, and property.

　　“义务”老人
    董干同志于１９８０年从部队离休回到了家乡江苏沭阳县七雄乡官田村。老董离休了，他是如何打发光阴的呢？
    　　　　义务投递员
    老董回乡后，发现乡邮电所只将报刊、信件送到村部，村里无人负责分发、投送，使一些报刊、信件在村部一放就是几天甚至１０多天，老董便揽下了义务送报、送信这份差事。每天，当乡邮电所投递员将报刊、信件送到村部时，他就将需要传递的报刊、信件装进自制的小邮包里，走村串户，及时送到户主手里。无论是严寒酷暑，还是刮风下雨，从不间断。８年里，老董共义务投送报刊４万多份，信件４２００多件，电报２１０封，领送汇款单１００８张，从无差错。
    　　　　义务修理员
    实行生产责任制以后，村里添置了２０多台手扶拖拉机。全村能驾驶手扶拖拉机的人不少，但会修理的人却不多。老董懂得农机具的修理技术。这些年来，不管谁家的农机具出了故障，他就去帮助修理。去年秋种时，村里的１台手扶拖拉机在村外路上趴窝了，驾驶员摆弄了半天也没修好。老董听说后，连晚饭也没顾上吃就跑了去。一检查，他发现是柴油机出了毛病，于是连夜拆修，一直忙到次日早晨才修好。驾驶员见老董浑身油污，眼都熬红了，特意买了２０多元钱的香烟和糖果送给他。老董摆手不要。８年来，老董先后帮助村里村外义务修理各种农机具２００多台次。
    　　　　义务调解员
    官田村一青年农民到泰州市鱼网厂做木工，后来户口迁到了泰州市东郊乡，吃上了定销粮。这青年认为自己的身价高了，便与妻子闹离婚。老董知道后，多次到这个青年家，对他进行批评教育。老董还写信同泰州市东郊乡的民政助理联系，请协助做好这个青年的思想工作。这个青年回心转意后，老董又连续多次写信与泰州市鱼网厂和东郊乡人民政府联系，请他们帮忙，将这个青年的妻子安排在东郊乡的乡办企业，使他们小两口能在一起生活。老董自离休以来，共义务调解婚姻、地界、财产等纠纷２０多起。　　　　　江苏沭阳县民政局　胡方佳
