Li Tieying, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, State Councilor, and Minister of the State Education Commission, said at the recently concluded 1989 State Education Commission work conference that developing China's educational undertakings, raising the quality of the entire nation, and cultivating laborers and specialized personnel with ideals, morality, culture, and discipline are extremely important tasks in building socialism.

During the conference, Premier Li Peng also listened to reports on relevant situations and had a discussion with some representatives.

Li Tieying said that since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, China's educational undertakings have made significant progress, and educational reforms are being deepened. The educational structure has been adjusted; the goals, key areas, and implementation steps of educational reform have become clearer; educational openness to the outside world has been continuously expanded, breaking the long-term semi-closed situation; educational investment has increased year by year, and the conditions for running schools have improved. He said that while recognizing and affirming the achievements of educational work, we must also clearly see the many contradictions and practical difficulties facing educational work. Educational funds are insufficient; teachers' remuneration and status are relatively low; the educational structure is still irrational; educational reform has not yet formed a comprehensive and coordinated reform pattern; education still exists with problems of being detached from the needs of social and economic development; ideological and moral education does not meet the requirements of the new situation; educational content and methods are to varying degrees detached from reality; educational quality is not high, and so on. These problems must be seriously addressed, and measures must be taken to resolve them decisively.

Li Tieying pointed out that we are building socialism in a country with a large population, relatively scarce resources, and severe financial shortages. Under these circumstances, we must shift economic construction to rely on technological progress and improving the quality of laborers. We must fully recognize the enormous role of education in promoting social progress. We must clearly see that currently, there are more than 200 million illiterates in the country, and the average number of years of education received by the nation is less than five. This backward state of education has a sharp contradiction with the needs of economic and social development, seriously constraining China's modernization construction. If we do not make great efforts now to improve education and develop productive forces, we will lose the opportunity, and the consequences will be unimaginable.

Li Tieying said that when formulating China's educational development strategy and development plan, we must start from China's national conditions and comprehensively consider various factors. The development of education will always be constrained by the economic base, and the development of the economy will also be constrained by education. Under the condition of limited educational investment, the development of education must pay more attention to improving efficiency.

He pointed out that currently, the situation of educational funds being tight in China is quite serious, and the development of education must strive to increase educational investment. We must actively open up multiple channels for raising educational funds. This year, despite the national economic adjustment and the tightening of fiscal and financial policies, the central government has decided to increase investment in education. In the long run, relying solely on increasing financial allocations will not solve the problem of developing educational undertakings. We must, through reform, truly make educational undertakings a matter for the entire people and a responsibility for the entire people. We must mobilize more social participation and more support from the people for educational undertakings, promoting the development of education.

Li Tieying said that educational system reform is the key to educational reform. Actively establishing an educational system that adapts to the needs of social and economic development, as well as establishing corresponding operating mechanisms, is an urgent task before us, and we must not miss the opportunity to carry out comprehensive educational reforms, starting with pilot projects.

Li Tieying pointed out that the hope for revitalizing the nation lies in education, and the hope for revitalizing education lies in teachers. Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, teachers' economic remuneration and social status have improved. However, the remuneration of teachers, especially primary and secondary school teachers, is still relatively low, affecting teachers' enthusiasm and the construction of the teaching team. This situation must be changed as soon as possible.

Li Tieying said that it is very important to do a good job in educational work in 1989. We must, under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, make the series of important guiding thoughts for the development and reform of education a common understanding of the entire Party and the people of the entire country, and take solid steps forward.

At this five-day State Education Commission work conference, representatives discussed extensively the planning and measures for the development and reform of education, the key points of the State Education Commission's work this year, and put forward many beneficial opinions and suggestions.

　　李铁映在国家教委工作会议上强调    
    教育落后制约现代化建设    
    必须下大力把教育搞上去
    新华社北京二月十八日电  中共中央政治局委员、国务委员、国家教委主任李铁映在刚刚结束的国家教委一九八九年工作会议上说，发展我国教育事业，提高全民族的素质，培养有理想、有道德、有文化、有纪律的劳动者和专门人才，是建设社会主义的一项极为重要的任务。
    这次会议期间，国务院总理李鹏还听取了有关情况汇报，并与部分代表进行了座谈。
    李铁映说，党的十一届三中全会以来，我国教育事业已经有了很大的发展，教育改革正在不断深入。教育结构有所调整；教育改革的目标、重点和实施步骤进一步明确；教育的对外开放不断扩大，打破了长期封闭半封闭的状况；教育投入逐年增加，办学条件有了改善。他说，在正确认识和肯定教育工作所取得的成绩的同时，必须清醒地看到教育工作所面临的许多矛盾和实际困难。教育经费紧缺；教师待遇和地位较低；教育结构仍不合理；教育改革尚未形成整体配套的改革格局；教育仍存在着脱离社会经济发展需要的问题；思想品德教育不适应新形势的要求；教育内容和方法不同程度地脱离实际；教育质量不够高，等等。必须认真对待这些问题，坚决采取措施加以解决。
    李铁映指出，我们是在一个人口众多，资源相对不足，资金严重短缺的国家里进行社会主义建设。在这种情况下，必须把经济建设转到依靠科技进步和提高劳动者素质的轨道上来。我们一定要充分认识教育对推动社会进步的巨大作用。必须清醒地看到，现在全国有两亿多文盲，国民平均受教育年限不足五年。教育的这种落后状况，同经济和社会发展的需要存在着尖锐的矛盾，严重制约着我国现代化建设。如果我们现在不作出极大的努力，把教育搞上去，发展社会生产力，就会丧失时机，后果将不堪设想。
    李铁映说，制定我国教育发展战略和发展规划，必须从我国国情出发，综合考虑各种因素。教育的发展总要受到经济基础的制约，经济的发展也会受到教育的制约。在教育投入有限的情况下，教育发展必须更加注意提高效益。
    他指出，当前，我国教育经费拮据的状况比较严重，发展教育必须努力增加教育投入。要积极开辟筹措教育经费的多种渠道。今年在国家进行经济调整，紧缩财政、金融的形势下，中央仍下决心要保教育，增加了教育的投入。从长远看，发展教育事业只靠增加财政拨款是难以解决问题的。必须通过改革，使教育事业真正成为全民的事业，全民的责任。要动员社会更多的参与和人民群众更多的支持教育事业，促进教育的发展。
    李铁映说，教育体制改革是教育改革的关键。积极建立适应社会经济发展需要的教育体制，以及建立相应的运行机制，是摆在我们面前的紧迫任务，必须不失时机地进行教育的综合改革，首先要搞好试点。
    李铁映指出，振兴民族的希望在教育，振兴教育的希望在教师。十一届三中全会以来，教师的经济待遇和社会地位有所提高。但教师特别是中小学教师待遇仍然偏低，影响了教师的积极性和教师队伍的建设。这种状况必须尽快加以改变。
    李铁映说，努力做好一九八九年的教育工作十分重要。我们要在党中央和国务院的领导下，使教育发展和改革的一系列重要指导思想成为全党和全国人民的共同认识，并迈出坚实的一步。
    在这次为期五天的教委工作会议上，代表们就教育发展和改革的规划、措施，国家教委今年工作要点等问题进行了广泛的讨论，提出了许多有益的意见和建议。
