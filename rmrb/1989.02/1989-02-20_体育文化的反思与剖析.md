The debate and reflection on the state of Chinese sports triggered by the 1988 Olympic Games were particularly active at the end of last year and the beginning of this year. This discussion has gone beyond the sports community and has attracted significant attention from the media, cultural, educational, and various other sectors of society.

The People's Daily has launched the "Sports Forum: A Hundred Voices" column, welcoming contributions from all sectors. Through a multifaceted analysis and debate on the social significance and functions of sports, the characteristics and roles of sports culture, and the current sports system in China, we aim to re-evaluate sports. We also hope to reflect various voices and provide references for the decision-making of sports authorities.

In 1984, the academic community was engulfed in a "cultural fever," with a wave of comparisons between Chinese and Western cultures sweeping through fields such as political science, economics, sociology, law, ethics, literature, anthropology, education, and social psychology. Generally, the formation of a cultural fever in a nation requires three conditions: first, changes in the nation's economic and political conditions; second, the provision of a reference system by external cultures; and third, a shake in people's beliefs in their original culture, leading to a sense of rebellion. Thus, there is a need to reflect on and re-evaluate culture. After the end of the "Cultural Revolution," and with the implementation of the reform and opening-up policy in the 1980s, China possessed all three conditions.

However, during this "cultural fever," the sports community was largely on the sidelines. At that time, there were very few articles and authors discussing sports culture research and reflection, making it quite desolate. "Low sports in culture" led the cultural community to overlook sports, while "low culture in sports" caused the sports community to lack the ability to communicate with the outside world. Additionally, they were still immersed in the joy of victory after the Los Angeles Olympics, making it unnecessary and impossible to reflect, and instead creating two "advanced" theories: "competitive sports advance the development of mass sports" and "sports advance economic development." A triumphant mindset makes it difficult to reflect calmly.

The results of the 1988 Olympic Games provided the long-awaited opportunity for Chinese sports culture reflection, which was four years overdue. In less than three months, critical articles, insider reports, reportage, Olympic reflection meetings, and cultural seminars frequently appeared, making the reflection on the Olympics a hot topic. This reflection initially began with angry accusations and venting, but later turned into a more calm cultural contemplation and realistic understanding.

However, there are still a few concerning aspects in today's sports culture reflection.

First, external reflection is more heated than internal reflection. Strictly speaking, this large-scale cultural reflection began with the pre-Olympics "Dream of a Strong Nation." Reportage literature was the first to open the gap, and the media, educational community, and other sectors quickly followed. It was hoped that the sports community would provide an explanation after the Olympics. However, the National Games and the City Games followed closely, and the reflection naturally cooled down. However, the cultural and media communities did not reduce their temperature, and a batch of works continued to emerge. The situation of "fried ice cream" appeared.

Second, superficial reflection is more common than deep reflection. Culture has three levels. The superficial level is the technical and equipment level, the middle level is the system and institutional level, and the core is the theoretical and conceptual level. An immature or self-proclaimed central power reflectionist is accustomed to superficial reflection. If our current reflection can only stay at the level of transforming training methods, increasing sports funding, and raising sports bonuses, and does not dare to delve deeper, then this reflection will definitely not lead to reform conclusions, but only strengthen the original system, let alone update sports concepts.

Third, passive reflection is more common than conscious reflection. Conscious reflection requires a sense of social responsibility, and this sense of responsibility comes from historical awakening. Accompanying this awakening is the painful self-blame. Our cultural reflection needs a spirit of self-blame.

We have indeed taken a step forward. The reflection on sports culture has indeed been carried out on a relatively large scale. We do not expect to achieve everything at once. Because the development of any culture is gradual, cannot be rushed, and cannot be separated from China's reality.

　　体育文化的反思与剖析
    北京体院  卢元镇
    由１９８８年奥运会所引发的对我国体育现状的争论和反思，在去年岁末和今年年初空前活跃。它已不仅仅局限在体育界，舆论界、文化界、教育界乃至社会各方面都对此投以极大的关注。
    本报新辟《体坛百家言》栏目，欢迎各界“百家”畅所欲言。通过对体育的社会意义和功能、体育文化的特点和作用、我国现行的体育体制等多方面的剖析和争论，重新认识体育；也希望反映各方面的声音，为体育主管部门的决策提供参考。

    １９８４年，学术界陷入“文化热”，一场中西文化对比在政治学、经济学、社会学、法学、伦理学、文学、人类学、教育学、社会心理学等许多领域同时展开。一般来说，一个民族的文化热的形成需具备三个条件：一是自身社会的经济和政治条件的变化；二是由于外来文化提供了一个参照系；三是因为人们对原有自我文化信仰产生动摇，形成一种逆反心理。于是需要对文化进行反思和再估计。结束了“文化大革命”，在８０年代，我国实行改革开放政策后，这三个条件都具备了。
    然而，在这场“文化热”中，体育界是游离于外的。当时，关于体育文化研究和反思的文章和者甚寡，十分寂寥。“文化中的低体育”，造成文化界无暇去顾及体育，而“体育中的低文化”，则使体育界缺乏与外界沟通的能力。当时又沉浸在洛杉矶奥运会后的胜利欢乐之中，非但没必要和可能去反思，反而创造出了“竞技体育对群众体育超前发展”，“体育对经济超前发展”的两个“超前”理论。得意的心态是难得冷静反思的。
    １９８８年奥运会的结果使迟到了４年之久的中国体育文化反思的契机终于到来。不到３个月的时间里，批评文章、内幕报道、报告文学、奥运反思会、文化研讨会频频出现，奥运会反思成了热点。这场反思先开始是愤怒的指责和宣泄，后来，就比较冷静地转入文化思索和现实理解。
    然而，当今的这场体育文化的反思还有几点令人忧虑的地方。
    第一，外部反思热于内部反思。严格讲，这场大规模文化反思是从奥运会前的《强国梦》开始的。报告文学率先打开缺口，新闻舆论界教育界纷纷行动。实指望，体育界在奥运会后会有一个交待。但农运会、城运会接踵而来，随后就自然处于冷却状态。然而文化界、新闻界并不肯降温，一批批作品还在涌现。出现了“油炸冰激凌”的状况。
    第二，表层反思多于深层反思。文化分三个层面。表层是技术、设备层面，中层是体制、制度层面，内核是理论、观念层面。一个不成熟的或以中央大国自居的反思者习惯于做表层反思。如果我们当今的这场反思只能停留在训练方法的改造、体育经费的增加、体育奖金的提高等表层认识上，而不准向深层解剖，那么这场反思就断乎引不出改革的结论，而只能是对原有体制的强化，更不要说体育观念的更新了。
    第三，被动反思多于自觉反思。自觉反思需要一种社会责任感，而这种责任感来自历史的觉醒。伴随着这场觉醒则是痛苦的自责，我们的文化反思需要有一种自责精神。
    我们毕竟前进了一步。体育文化的反思毕竟在一个较大的范围内展开了。我们不期望毕其功于一役。因为任何一种文化的发展都是逐进的、不可操之过急，更不可脱离中国的现实。
