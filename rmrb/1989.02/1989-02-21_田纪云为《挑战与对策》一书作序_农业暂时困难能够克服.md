Tian Jiyun, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council, wrote in the preface to the forthcoming book "Challenges and Countermeasures - 100 Topics on Achieving Agricultural Bounties" that as long as all levels of Party committees and governments strengthen their leadership in rural work and agricultural production, resolutely implement the line of the Thirteenth National Party Congress, earnestly carry out the decisions and measures of the National Rural Work Conference and the decisions on achieving a bumper harvest in 1989, rely on the efforts of hundreds of millions of farmers, the current problems in agricultural development can be solved, temporary difficulties in progress can be overcome, the goal of achieving bumper harvests in the next two years and raising agricultural production to a new level can be realized, and the situation in rural areas and agricultural production can basically meet the needs of the Four Modernizations, the improvement of people's lives, and the needs of reform and opening up, thus providing good material and social conditions for building socialism with Chinese characteristics.

Tian Jiyun said: We must fully recognize the role of the past decade of reform in promoting agriculture, as well as the conditions that agricultural development has provided for reform and social development. However, we cannot be satisfied with these achievements, nor can we stop at the current level. We must face up to the new challenges we face in the agricultural sector. First, China's population is increasing by more than ten million per year, while arable land is decreasing by several million mu per year, which is a very serious situation. Second, with the development of the economy and the improvement of people's living standards, the demand for grain and grain-derived products, as well as other agricultural products, has greatly increased. Third, with the implementation of the open policy and the coastal development strategy, our international exchanges have expanded, and the demand for foreign exchange has greatly increased. We need to export goods to earn foreign exchange. But now the production of major agricultural products has stagnated, and export sources will inevitably be affected. These are the new challenges we face in the agricultural sector. This new situation requires that agricultural production must reach a new level.

He pointed out: Rectifying the economic environment and rectifying the economic order are the key tasks for China's reform and construction in the next two years. However, vigorously developing agriculture, especially grain production, and increasing the effective supply of agricultural and sideline products, are crucial for stabilizing prices, achieving the goals of "rectification" and "rectification," and stabilizing the overall situation. It is an arduous task for the entire Party and the people of the whole country to ensure a good harvest in agriculture, especially this year.

　　田纪云为《挑战与对策》一书作序
    农业暂时困难能够克服
    据新华社北京２月２０日电  中共中央政治局委员、国务院副总理田纪云，在为将于近日内出版的《挑战与对策——夺取农业丰收百题》一书撰写的序言中指出：只要各级党委和政府加强对农村工作和农业生产的领导，坚决执行党的十三大的路线，认真落实全国农村工作会议和会议所作的夺取１９８９年农业丰收的决定的精神以及各项措施，依靠亿万农民的努力，当前发展农业中的一些问题就能够解决，前进中的暂时困难就能够战胜，夺取今明两年的农业丰收和使农业再攀登一个新的台阶的目标就能够实现，农村和农业生产的形势就能够基本适应四化建设的需要，适应人民生活改善的需要，适应改革、开放的需要，为建设有中国特色的社会主义提供良好的物质和社会条件。
    田纪云说：我们要充分认识十年改革对农业的促进作用，以及农业的发展为改革和社会发展提供的条件。但是，不能满足于这个成就，不能停留在现有水平上，必须正视我们在农业问题上面临着新的挑战。第一，我国人口一年以一千几百万的速度在增加，而耕地每年却以几百万亩的速度在减少，这是一个十分严重的情况。第二，随着经济的发展和人民生活水平的提高，对粮食和粮食转化物以及对其他农产品的需求大大增加。第三，随着开放政策的实施，随着沿海地区经济发展战略的实施，我们同国际的交往扩大，外汇需求量大大增加，我们需要出口东西换取外汇。但现在主要农产品生产出现徘徊，出口货源必然受到影响。这就是我们在农业问题上面临的新挑战。这种新的形势要求农业生产必须再攀登一个新台阶。
    他指出：治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序，是我国今明两年改革和建设的重点。而大力发展农业特别是粮食生产，增加农副产品的有效供应，对于平抑物价，实现“治理”、“整顿”要求，稳定大局至关重要。千方百计使今明两年特别是今年农业有一个好的收成，这是摆在全党和全国人民面前的一项严峻任务。
