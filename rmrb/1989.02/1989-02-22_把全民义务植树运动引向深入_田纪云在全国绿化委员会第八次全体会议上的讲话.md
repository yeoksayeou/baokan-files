The Eighth Plenary Session of the National Afforestation Committee was held. This session, which is the eighth of its kind since the committee's establishment, primarily aims to analyze the current situation, clarify tasks, propose measures, and mobilize efforts to further deepen the National Obligatory Tree Planting Movement. This session is an expanded meeting, attended not only by members of the National Afforestation Committee but also by leaders from various provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the Central Government, and responsible officials from forestry departments. Planting trees and afforesting the country is a crucial task for the entire Party and the nation, requiring high attention and concrete organization from local and departmental leaders. This meeting, held in Guangdong, has the characteristics of an on-site meeting. We invite everyone to observe Guangdong's afforestation efforts and learn from their experiences. We must strengthen leadership, work diligently, and effectively carry out afforestation tasks in our respective regions and departments, pushing the great cause of greening the country forward. Now, I will share a few thoughts for everyone's discussion.

1. The Current Situation of Afforestation and National Obligatory Tree Planting

On December 13, 1981, the Fourth Session of the Fifth National People's Congress passed the "Resolution on Launching the National Obligatory Tree Planting Movement." Over the past seven years, the Chinese people have worked tirelessly to beautify our rivers and mountains, striving to cover the land with greenery. Overall, afforestation and greening, as well as tree and grass planting, have achieved significant results, and the situation is good. The national awareness of greening the country has significantly improved, and the desire to quickly improve the ecological environment has become more urgent. Most provinces, municipalities, and departments have taken afforestation and obligatory tree planting seriously, actively propagating and mobilizing the masses. During the tree-planting season each year, many places have seen the inspiring scene of thousands and tens of thousands of people planting trees together. In the past seven years, the nation has planted over 70 billion trees. The first phase of the "Three-North" Shelterbelt Construction Project has been completed, with over 90 million mu of afforestation, and the second phase is underway. There are now 223 counties nationwide that have reached the plain greening standard. Nationwide, 160 million mu of grassland has been improved. Urban greening has developed rapidly. The total area of urban green spaces has reached 280,000 hectares, doubling in seven years. The People's Liberation Army has been at the forefront of the national obligatory tree planting movement. Departmental greening has also made new progress. Organizations such as the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Communist Youth League, and the All-China Women's Federation have done a great deal of work to promote the National Obligatory Tree Planting Movement and have achieved good results.

In recent years, various regions and departments have gained valuable experience in carrying out the National Obligatory Tree Planting Movement and afforestation work. For example, breaking down tasks layer by layer and implementing the afforestation target responsibility system for leading cadres during their terms; fully mobilizing the masses to undertake greening; delineating greening responsibility areas and establishing obligatory tree planting bases; formulating greening plans and setting phased goals; establishing regulations and strictly inspecting and accepting work, with clear rewards and punishments; broadening funding channels and raising greening funds from various sources; organizing people's congress representatives to inspect obligatory tree planting, and so on. By combining these experiences with local realities and actively promoting them, we can further deepen the National Obligatory Tree Planting Movement and more effectively carry out the greening of the country, which will have a good driving effect.

Through the National Obligatory Tree Planting Movement, some places have begun to see good ecological, economic, and social benefits. The environmental appearance of many places has improved significantly, the microclimate has improved, the ability to resist natural disasters has been enhanced, and agricultural and pastoral development has been promoted. The National Obligatory Tree Planting Movement has also promoted the construction of socialist spiritual civilization, igniting the enthusiasm of urban and rural residents to love their hometowns and green the Chinese land, and fostering a sense of honor, responsibility, and legal awareness in fulfilling civic duties. In some places, cadres and the masses plant commemorative trees on significant occasions such as birthdays, enrollments, graduations, joining the party, military service, weddings, childbirth, and retirement, inscribing memories on trees and expressing emotions through forests, cultivating new moral customs. Practice has proven that launching the National Obligatory Tree Planting Movement is a great initiative that aligns with China's national conditions and the will of the people. It not only enjoys the support of the vast majority of domestic people but also receives praise and support internationally.

While the situation for afforestation and National Obligatory Tree Planting is good, we must also be aware that there are still significant gaps between the current state and the decisions of the National People's Congress and the requirements of the Central Committee and the State Council. First, some comrades still do not fully understand the importance of greening the country, have weak legal awareness, and lack greening consciousness, treating the statutory obligatory tree planting tasks as optional. Especially in some places and units, leaders do not pay enough attention to greening, do not prioritize it in their agendas, and lack effective measures. Second, the development of the National Obligatory Tree Planting Movement is uneven. Nationwide, the number of participants and the number of trees planted are far from the statutory requirements. Currently, about 10 billion trees are planted annually, and the number of participants is only about one-third of the statutory number. Some villages and cities, as well as some units, have not yet launched the National Obligatory Tree Planting Movement. Third, some places lack overall planning for afforestation, lack long-term vision, and only focus on afforestation during the planting season, year after year, with little greening effect. Fourth, inspections and acceptance are not strict, and the quality of tree planting is low. Some places do not pay attention to science in afforestation, planting trees just to meet the quota, without strengthening management, resulting in a large reported greening area but little actual survival, doubling the effort for half the result, and dampening the enthusiasm of the masses. Fifth, some places lack sufficient mental preparation for the long-term and arduous nature of greening the country, and their determination and enthusiasm for afforestation are not as strong as before, leading to a stagnation in greening work. These problems must be highly regarded, and measures must be taken promptly to address them.

The past afforestation work has achieved significant results, which must be fully affirmed. However, we must also be aware that, in terms of the entire country, there are still vast areas of barren mountains, wastelands, and beaches that need greening. The greening tasks in cities and villages are still quite arduous. To fundamentally improve the ecological environment of the country, long-term efforts are needed. If we do not enhance our sense of responsibility and urgency, do not seriously address the current problems, and do not change the general approach to work, the afforestation work and the National Obligatory Tree Planting Movement may stagnate or even decline. Therefore, we must adopt a long-term perspective for greening work, maintain strong willpower, and persistently grasp it without letting go, continuously pushing it to new heights.

2. Enhancing Awareness, Strengthening Leadership, and Effectively Organizing and Mobilizing

Planting trees and greening the country is a great cause of governing the rivers and mountains, establishing a good ecological barrier, promoting economic development, and benefiting future generations. It is one of China's fundamental national policies. A developed forestry industry is a sign of national prosperity, ethnic prosperity, and social civilization. Our Party and government have always attached great importance to tree planting and greening the country. As early as the 1950s, they called for greening the country and achieving a garden-like land. In recent years, they have placed it in one of the fundamental national policies. Comrade Deng Xiaoping attaches great importance to the greening of the country and personally advocates for the National Obligatory Tree Planting Movement, leading by example every year. He pointed out: "Planting trees and greening the country is a great cause of building socialism and benefiting future generations. We must persist for 20 years, 100 years, 1000 years, and pass it down from generation to generation." Currently, China's ecological environment is severe, with a very low forest coverage rate, many barren mountains, serious soil erosion, and frequent natural disasters such as droughts, floods, and sandstorms. In such a situation, the annual forest consumption still far exceeds the growth rate, continuing to reduce the already scarce forests. This situation must not be allowed to continue, otherwise, it will have serious consequences.

Forestry is an important industry in the national economy, not only providing economic benefits but also ecological and social benefits. Forestry is a multifunctional industry. Without saying much, its impact on agriculture is evident. The development of forestry can provide a good ecological barrier for agriculture, animal husbandry, and fisheries, and protect agricultural water conservancy facilities, enabling them to function fully. Ensuring stable and high agricultural production requires strengthening agricultural basic construction, but engineering measures and biological measures must be combined, and attention must be paid to tree and grass planting. From a long-term and fundamental perspective, the problem of forest and grass coverage must be solved. While arranging agricultural development and water conservancy construction, local authorities must place forestry in its proper position and do a good job of forest and grass construction. In short, developing forestry construction is a highly profitable endeavor.

To accelerate the development of forestry and do a good job of greening the country, the key is for leaders at all levels to pay attention and work hard; the other key is to mobilize the masses and have the whole society participate in greening. These two aspects are indispensable. The characteristics of forestry and greening construction are highly social, affecting all aspects and thousands of households. Afforestation, forest management, and forest protection require a certain amount of funds, but more importantly, a large amount of labor input. This fully illustrates that the development of forestry and greening must rely on local governments at all levels to organize the broad masses of cadres and the people to actively participate in this great cause. Due to the long cycle and slow results of forestry, especially the ecological benefits of forests, which are often not easily recognized by people, forestry needs even more support from governments at all levels. The public welfare nature of afforestation and greening construction is strong, involving a wide range of departments and industries, and must rely on the whole society to carry it out. Alongside railways, highways, rivers, canals, lakes, reservoirs, military camps, industrial areas, agricultural and pastoral fishing fields, greening must be promoted. All departments and units must actively complete their greening tasks. The country, collectives, and individuals must all participate, and all industries must participate, with everyone working together to develop forestry and greening the country.

An important aspect of strengthening the leadership of tree planting and greening the country is to implement the responsibility system. In 1984, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, in their "Instructions on Deepening and Solidly Promoting the Movement to Green the Country," clearly stated: "The responsibility for planting trees and grasses and greening the country should be placed on the shoulders of leading cadres at all levels of party committees and governments and all units. This should be established as a system and become an important part of the assessment of cadres." In 1987, the Central Committee again proposed: "Implement the responsibility system for protecting and developing forest resources during the term of office of leading cadres. The increase or decrease of forest resources should be an important part of the assessment of the performance of county leaders." All regions and departments should universally establish and improve the responsibility system for greening targets during the term of office of leading cadres. The responsibility system for greening targets during the term of office of leading cadres should be implemented in five aspects: greening planning targets, signing responsibility letters layer by layer, leading cadres personally taking charge of greening, regular inspections and evaluations, and implementing assessment indicators and reward and punishment measures. The greening targets for the term of office of leading cadres should be determined through certain forms, and regular assessments should be conducted with clear rewards and punishments. Special attention should be paid to making the term targets specific and quantitative to facilitate organization and assessment. At the same time, attention should be paid to the continuity and stability of the responsibility system, which should not be affected by the change of leaders.

The Guangdong Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government attach great importance to afforestation work and made the decision in 1985 to "eliminate barren mountains in five years and green Guangdong in ten years." Starting with Comrade Lin Ruoshui, leaders at all levels have taken personal charge, vigorously promoting implementation, accelerating the pace of greening, and achieving remarkable results. They have strengthened the leadership of greening work in six aspects: implementing the responsibility system for greening targets during the term of office of leading cadres and signing responsibility letters layer by layer; leading cadres personally taking charge of greening and promoting it from point to surface; strictly implementing inspection and acceptance systems; taking comprehensive measures to control the consumption of forest resources; broadening funding channels and actively supporting afforestation and greening; and seriously conducting assessments with clear rewards and punishments. Their attention to and leadership of greening work are not just in words but are implemented by leaders at all levels who work hard and do not let go. Due to effective measures, after more than three years of effort, the province has afforested 43 million mu, and the goal of greening Guangdong in ten years is within reach. Guangdong's experience is good, and all regions and departments should seriously learn from their experience, especially the main leaders who should attach importance to forestry, vigorously promote it, strengthen leadership, and do a good job of organizing and mobilizing to further accelerate the greening of the country.

3. Tasks and Requirements for the Future

Launching the National Obligatory Tree Planting Movement is a resolution of the National People's Congress, and the State Council has issued the "Implementation Measures." The state has legislated to fix the tree planting tasks of citizens, fully demonstrating the strategic significance of tree planting and afforestation and indicating the determination of the Party and the state to green the country, improve the ecological environment, and promote economic development and social progress. The National Afforestation Committees at all levels should take this work seriously and elevate it to the level of law enforcement. All regions and departments should truly place tree planting and greening the country in the position of national policy, making the National Obligatory Tree Planting Movement and afforestation work achieve a breakthrough.

Regarding the basic tasks of afforestation and greening work in the coming period, the following aspects should be focused on: First, deeply promote the National Obligatory Tree Planting Movement. Each eligible citizen should plant 3-5 trees per year, which is a statutory obligation that must be fulfilled and should be implemented according to regulations. There are approximately 700 million eligible citizens nationwide. According to the requirement of planting 3-5 trees per person per year, 21-35 billion trees should be planted annually, equivalent to 100-170 million mu of afforestation. All regions should break down the obligatory tree planting indicators layer by layer and implement them step by step. Second, further improve the greening of railways, highways, canal sides, lakes, reservoirs, industrial areas, agricultural and pastoral fishing fields, military camps, and the barren mountains, wastelands, and beaches under the responsibility of various systems, enterprises, and units, according to relevant regulations and requirements, seriously formulate plans, and complete the greening tasks in stages. Coal, paper-making, and other large-scale enterprises that use wood as raw materials should extract a certain amount of afforestation fees to establish their own raw material forest bases in stages and batches. Third, while focusing on surface obligatory tree planting and departmental afforestation, key efforts should be made to develop fast-growing, high-yield timber bases and the five major shelterbelt systems, and develop firewood and economic forests according to local conditions to accelerate the development of forestry. Fourth, urban greening should continue to develop in depth. The focus should be on building large-scale environmental greening, actively promoting suburban greening. Coastal open cities should further accelerate the pace of greening, and the greening of county towns and built-up towns should be put on the agenda. Various units should actively green courtyards, factory areas, campuses, and residential areas, further improving the work and living environment. Fifth, in greening work, attention should be paid to local conditions, combining trees, shrubs, and grasses, and arranging grass planting tasks. Especially in deserts, dry and semi-dry areas, and areas with severe soil erosion, grass and shrubs should be planted first to achieve ideal greening effects.

Based on the requirements for greening work in the coming period, the tasks for this year are very arduous. The National Afforestation Committees at all levels must strengthen leadership, carefully organize, and do a good job in all aspects of work, especially focusing on the following aspects:

(1) Formulating comprehensive plans for obligatory tree planting and departmental afforestation and greening. The goals for 1990, 1995, and 2000 should be determined. This is the key to ensuring the continuous and healthy development of the National Obligatory Tree Planting Movement and afforestation work and is the prerequisite for implementing the responsibility system for greening targets during the term of office of leading cadres. The obligatory tree planting plans of all regions should be organically combined with the overall afforestation and greening plans, becoming an important part of them. All regions, departments, and units should formulate obligatory tree planting plans layer by layer, implement obligatory tree planting tasks according to the number of eligible citizens, implement land plots, and implement seedlings and other supporting measures. The afforestation and greening plans of departments should be coordinated with the local afforestation and greening plans. All departments should formulate afforestation and greening plans according to their own characteristics, quickly compile afforestation and greening plans for their systems, and implement them step by step, incorporating them into the afforestation and greening plans of provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities). At the same time, they should make clear regulations on greening standards, funding channels, completion deadlines, and leadership responsibilities for their systems. Coal, light industry and paper-making, and departments and enterprises that use wood and bamboo as raw materials should formulate plans to establish raw material forest bases. Efforts should be made to promote joint afforestation. The forestry department should provide services for various industries to create raw material forest bases and create conditions. Joint afforestation is beneficial to the country, local governments, and departments. All regions and departments should take a comprehensive approach, plan together, and take active measures. There should be new breakthroughs in this area this year.

In the future, the National Afforestation Committee will inspect the greening work of all regions and departments, with a key focus on whether there are plans and whether the plans are implemented layer by layer. This is also an important part of the assessment of the work of local greening offices.

(2) Legal afforestation, strict implementation. Deepening the National Obligatory Tree Planting Movement and doing a good job in mobilization work is necessary, but an important aspect is to achieve legal afforestation. All regions and departments should seriously implement the decisions of the National People's Congress and the implementation measures of the State Council, as well as relevant greening regulations, and formulate supporting measures according to local conditions. Tree planting tasks should be assigned according to regulations, and the 3-5 tree planting tasks should be further specified according to local conditions, implemented according to the plan, and assigned to each unit and village, down to the individual. For units and individuals who fail to fulfill their obligations without reason, economic penalties should be imposed according to the economic development level of the region. In short, there should be rules to follow, and they should be strictly implemented.

(3) Attaching importance to science and technology, strengthening management, and improving afforestation quality. Currently, the most prominent problem in some places is the poor quality of tree planting, poor management, and low survival rate. This situation must be changed through measures.

To improve the quality and benefits of tree planting, first, we must emphasize science. Currently, our tree planting is still stuck in the traditional extensive management model, and this is even more pronounced in the mass obligatory tree planting. To improve the actual benefits of afforestation and greening, we must attach importance to science and technology and implement scientific management. We should carry out construction according to scientific plans, formulate standards in seedling cultivation, planting, nurturing, and management, and operate according to technical procedures. For large-scale afforestation, construction should be carried out according to design, and if conditions permit, it should be carried out according to the engineering afforestation method to ensure the quality of tree planting and truly achieve management and survival. At the same time, we should seriously carry out nurturing to promote the growth of trees. We should gradually establish obligatory tree planting archives and protect the results of obligatory tree planting.

Tree planting is not for show or for reporting numbers; it must be practical and effective, not formalistic. Afforestation and greening must insist on inspections and acceptance, and report truthfully. This should be established as a strict system. Inspections and acceptance should not only praise the good but also criticize the poor. While focusing on task implementation, we should also focus on inspections and acceptance. These are two closely related key links that must be firmly grasped by greening offices at all levels and not let go. Obligatory tree planting that does not survive should not be considered a fulfilled obligation and should be replanted within a time limit.

(4) Effectively doing a good job in the "three defenses" of forestry. The development of forestry should follow the policy of accelerating cultivation, strengthening protection, and rational utilization. That is, on the one hand, we should vigorously plant trees and afforest, strengthen cultivation, and accelerate the development of forestry; on the other hand, we should strictly control the consumption of forest resources and not exceed the logging quotas. Forest land and urban green spaces should be strictly protected and not be destroyed or occupied under any pretext. Those who violate regulations and arbitrarily destroy trees, occupy forest land, and green spaces should be seriously investigated and corrected in a timely manner. Currently, forest fires, forest pests and diseases, and illegal logging are the "three major disasters" in forestry, and they are quite serious in some places. In response to this situation, all regions must effectively do a good job in the "three defenses." We should implement the policy of prevention first, establish and improve the "three defenses" management system, and improve prevention and control measures. For forest fires, we should establish and improve fire prevention organizations according to the regulations of the State Council, implement the responsibility system for leaders at all levels, and achieve "prevention first, active extinguishment." For pests and diseases, we should take effective measures, strengthen quarantine and prevention work, implement comprehensive treatment, and effectively protect forestry resources. For illegal logging and hunting, local governments and relevant departments at all levels must strictly enforce laws and regulations, strengthen management, eliminate various inducements, prevent problems from occurring, and immediately investigate and stop them if they do occur.

(5) Strengthening propaganda and education work. Propaganda and mobilization are important links in promoting the development of forestry and greening construction, and all regions and departments must do a good job in this regard. Past greening propaganda work has achieved results, but it is not as widespread as family planning and traffic safety propaganda. This year marks the 40th anniversary of the founding of the nation and the 10th anniversary of Arbor Day. We should seize this opportunity to do a good job in propaganda. We should vigorously promote tree planting and afforestation as a great cause of protecting the country, improving the ecological environment, benefiting the present, and benefiting future generations; promote the dual construction of forestry and people as a strategic measure; and promote the statutory, public welfare, and national nature of obligatory tree planting. We should create a strong public opinion, making it known to every household and every individual, so that all citizens further enhance their awareness and actively participate in obligatory tree planting, fostering a social custom where everyone is responsible for greening the country, participating in obligatory tree planting is glorious, and not fulfilling obligations is shameful. Radio, television, newspapers, and other media should strengthen greening propaganda work. The forms of propaganda should be diverse, attractive, and effective.

Since the launch of the National Obligatory Tree Planting Movement, many advanced units, activists, and labor models have emerged in the great struggle of the billion people to transform nature. All regions, departments, and units should commend and reward those who have completed their greening tasks well, and publicize their deeds. The National Afforestation Committee will establish the "National Greening Medal." Every Arbor Day, medals will be awarded to individuals who have made outstanding achievements in greening across the country to inspire and mobilize the people, and promote the greening of the country to develop deeply and sustainably.

The tree planting season this year has arrived, and tree planting activities are gradually being carried out from south to north. Southern regions should take immediate action, and other regions should make early preparations for all aspects of work. We should seize the opportunity to focus on spring tree planting and afforestation, making breakthroughs in both quantity and quality this year.

Comrades! From now until the end of the century, there are still 12 years left. Let us face difficulties head-on, persist, and grasp the tree planting and greening of the country year by year, solidly and practically. With 12 years of effort, we will achieve a doubling of the national GDP and make the vast Chinese land more beautiful and prosperous by the end of the century!

　　把全民义务植树运动引向深入
    田纪云在全国绿化委员会第八次全体会议上的讲话
    新华社北京２月２１日电  田纪云同志１９８９年２月１９日在全国绿化委员会第八次全体（扩大）会议上的讲话，全文如下：同志们：
    全国绿化委员会成立以来，这是第八次全体会议。这次会议，主要是分析形势，明确任务，提出措施，动员部署，把全民义务植树运动进一步引向深入，加快林业发展，加快绿化祖国大地的进程。这次会议是扩大会议，除了全国绿化委员会的成员外，还有各省、自治区、直辖市主管林业的领导同志和林业部门的负责同志参加。植树造林、绿化祖国是全党全民的一项重要任务，要靠各地方和各部门的领导高度重视，并具体组织落实。这次在广东开会，有现场会的性质，请大家来看一看广东的绿化，学一学广东的经验，切实加强领导，深入扎实地做好本地区、本部门的工作，把绿化祖国的伟大事业大大向前推进一步。现在，我讲几点意见，供大家讨论。
    　　　　一、造林绿化和全民义务植树的形势
    １９８１年１２月１３日，五届全国人大四次会议作出了《关于开展全民义务植树运动的决议》。７年来，我国人民为装点祖国河山，使大地披上绿装，艰苦努力，做了大量卓有成效的工作。总的说来，造林绿化、植树种草取得了很大成绩，形势是好的。全国各族人民对绿化祖国的重视程度有了很大提高，要求尽快改善生态环境的愿望更加迫切。绝大多数省市区和部门，对造林绿化和义务植树抓得很紧，积极宣传群众，发动群众。每年植树季节，很多地方出现了千军万马齐上阵，大搞植树造林的动人场面。在过去的７年里，全民义务植树７０多亿株。“三北”防护林建设第一期工程已经完成，共造林９０００多万亩，第二期工程正在加紧进行。全国达到平原绿化标准的县已有２２３个。全国种草和改良草地已经达到１．６亿亩。城市绿化发展迅速。全国园林绿地的总面积已经达到２８万公顷，７年时间翻了一番。人民解放军在绿化祖国、全民义务植树运动中走在前列。部门绿化也有新的进展。工会、共青团、妇联等组织，为深入开展全民义务植树运动，作了大量工作，取得了很好的效果。
    几年来，各地、各部门在开展全民义务植树和绿化工作中，摸索出了不少好的经验。如任务层层分解，实行领导干部任期绿化目标责任制；充分发动群众，全民办绿化；划定绿化责任区，建立义务植树基地；制定绿化规划，确定分阶段奋斗目标；制定法规制度，严格检查验收，严明奖罚；广辟集资渠道，多方筹集绿化资金；省、市、县人大常委会组织人大代表视察义务植树情况，等等。结合各地实际，积极推广这些经验，对进一步深入开展全民义务植树运动，更有效地开展绿化祖国活动，将起到很好的推动作用。
    通过开展全民义务植树运动，一些地方开始产生良好的生态效益、经济效益和社会效益。不少地方的环境面貌有较大改观，小气候有所改善，抵御自然灾害的能力增强，促进了农牧业的发展。全民义务植树运动，也促进了社会主义精神文明建设，激发了城乡人民热爱家乡、绿化中华大地的热情，树立履行公民义务的光荣感、责任感和法制观念。一些地方的干部群众在生日、入学、毕业、入团、参军、结婚、生育和离退休等有纪念意义的时刻，栽植纪念树，铭志于树，寄情于林，培养了新的道德风尚。实践证明，开展全民义务植树运动，是符合我国国情、顺乎民意的伟大创举，不仅受到国内广大群众的拥护，而且国际上也是赞扬和支持的。
    讲造林绿化和全民义务植树的形势好，并不是说没有问题。我们还必须清醒地看到：当前全民义务植树和造林绿化的状况，同全国人大的决议和中央、国务院的要求还有很大差距。一是还有相当一部分同志对绿化祖国的重要性认识不深，法制观念不强，绿化意识淡薄，把法定的义务植树任务看成可有可无。特别是有的地方和单位的领导对绿化不够重视，摆不上议事日程，措施不力。二是全民义务植树运动发展很不平衡，就全国来说，还远未达到法定的参加人数和应完成的株数。现在每年大约义务植树１０亿株左右，参加植树的人数只相当于法定人数的１／３左右。有些乡村和城市的部分单位至今没有开展全民义务植树运动。三是有的地方对造林绿化没有统筹规划，缺少长远打算，每逢植树季节，就临时抓一阵，年复一年，绿化成效不大。四是检查验收不严，植树造林质量不高。一些地方植树造林不讲究科学，种上就算完，不加强管护，统计的绿化面积不小，实际保存下来的不多，事倍功半，也挫伤了群众的积极性。五是有的地方对绿化国土的长期性、艰巨性缺乏足够的思想准备，造林绿化的决心和劲头没有前几年那样大，产生了松劲厌战和畏难情绪，绿化工作徘徊不前。这些问题应当引起我们的高度重视，迅速采取措施，及早加以解决。
    过去的造林绿化工作取得了很大成绩，要充分肯定。但是应该清醒地看到，从整个国土讲，还有大量的荒山、荒地、荒滩没有绿化，城市和乡村的绿化任务还相当艰巨，要从根本上改善国土的生态环境，还要作长期的努力。如果不增强责任感，没有紧迫感，不去认真解决目前存在的问题，不改变一般化的工作方法，造林绿化工作和全民义务植树运动就有停滞、甚至走下坡路的可能。因此，对绿化工作，必须树立长期作战的观点，保持旺盛的斗志，坚持不懈地紧抓不放，并把它不断推向新的水平。
    　　　　二、提高认识，加强领导，切实做好组织发动工作
    植树造林，绿化祖国，是治理山河，建立良好生态屏障，促进经济发展，造福子孙后代的伟大事业，是我国的一项基本国策。发达的林业，是国家富足、民族繁荣、社会文明的标志之一。我们的党和政府历来重视植树造林、绿化国土这项伟大事业。早在５０年代就发出绿化祖国、实现大地园林化的号召。近几年又把它放到基本国策之一的位置。邓小平同志对国土绿化这件事极为重视，他亲自倡导开展全民义务植树运动，并身体力行，每年带头植树造林。他指出：“植树造林，绿化祖国，是建设社会主义，造福子孙后代的伟大事业，要坚持２０年，坚持１００年，坚持１０００年，要一代一代永远干下去。”目前，我国的生态环境现状是严峻的，国土的森林覆盖率很低，荒山秃岭很多，水土流失比较严重，旱涝风沙等自然灾害不断发生。在这样的情况下，每年森林消耗量仍然大大超过生长量，使本来就很少的森林还在继续减少。这种状况，决不能再任其发展下去，否则，将后患无穷。
    林业是国民经济的一项重要产业，不但具有经济效益，而且具有生态效益和社会效益。林业是具有多功能的产业，别的不说，就讲林业对农业的影响那也是显而易见的。林业的发展能为农业、牧业、渔业提供良好的生态屏障，并能保护农田水利设施，使其充分发挥作用。保障农业稳产高产，需要加强农田基本建设，但必须实行工程措施与生物措施相结合，要重视植树种草。从长远和根本着眼，林草覆盖问题必须解决好。各地在安排农业开发和搞农田水利建设的同时，要把林业放在应有的位置上，搞好林草建设。总之，抓林业建设是一本万利的事情。
    加快林业发展，搞好国土绿化的根本，一是各级领导重视，真抓实干；一是广泛动员，全社会办绿化。这两个方面，缺一不可。林业和绿化建设的特点是具有很强的社会性，它关系到方方面面和千家万户。造林、营林和森林保护，要有一定的资金，但更需要大量的劳力投入。这就充分说明发展林业、搞好绿化，必须依靠各级地方政府组织广大干部群众积极投入到这项伟大事业中去。由于林业的周期长、见效慢，特别是森林的生态效益往往又不易被人们所认识，因此，林业更需要各级政府加强领导，大力支持。造林和绿化建设事业公益性强，涉及面广，与各部门、各行业关系密切，必须依靠全社会来办。铁路、公路、江河、渠道两旁，湖泊、水库周围，部队营区、工矿区、农牧渔场等都要把绿化搞上去。各部门、各单位都要积极完成各自的绿化任务。要国家、集体、个人一起上，各行各业一起上，大家办林业，全民搞绿化。
    加强对植树造林、绿化国土工作的领导，很重要的一条是，要实行责任制。１９８４年，中共中央、国务院在《关于深入扎实地开展绿化祖国运动的指示》中明确提出：“要把植树种草、绿化祖国的责任放在各级党委、政府和所有单位领导干部的肩上。……这要作为一项制度，成为考核干部的一个重要内容”。１９８７年中央又提出：“实行领导干部保护、发展森林资源任期目标责任制。”“森林资源的消长，应作为考核县领导政绩的主要内容之一。”各地、各部门都要普遍建立健全领导干部任期绿化目标责任制。领导干部任期绿化目标责任制，要切实做到“五落实”，即：绿化规划目标落实；层层签订责任状落实；领导亲自办点落实；定期检查评比落实；考核指标和奖惩办法落实。领导干部任期绿化目标要通过一定的形式确定下来，坚持定期考核，奖罚分明。特别要注意使任期目标具体化、定量化，以便组织落实和检查考核。同时，要注意责任制的连续性和稳定性，不能因领导人的更迭而受到影响。
    广东省委、省政府对造林绿化工作很重视，１９８５年作出了“五年消灭荒山，十年绿化广东”的决定。从林若同志做起，各级领导亲自动手，狠抓落实，绿化步伐加快，成绩显著。他们加强绿化工作的领导，主要体现在六个方面，即：实行领导干部任期绿化目标责任制，层层签订责任状；领导干部亲自办点，以点带面；严格执行检查验收制度；采取综合措施，控制森林资源消耗；广开资金渠道，积极扶持造林绿化；认真考核，奖罚分明。他们对绿化工作的重视和领导，不是停留在口头上，而是各级领导真抓实干，一级抓一级，紧抓不放。由于措施得力，经过三年多的努力，全省新造林面积达４３００万亩，十年绿化广东大有希望。广东的经验是很好的，各地、各部门要认真学习他们的经验，特别是主要领导同志要重视林业，狠抓林业，切实加强领导，做好组织发动工作，以进一步加快国土绿化的进程。
    　　　　三、今后的任务和要求
    开展全民义务植树运动是全国人大作出的决议，国务院颁发了《实施办法》。国家以立法的形式把公民的植树任务固定下来，这充分说明了植树造林的重大战略意义，也表明了党和国家绿化国土，改善生态环境，促进经济发展和社会进步的决心。各级绿化委员会应把这项工作提到执法的高度认真抓好，各地、各部门要真正把植树造林、绿化祖国提到国策的位置上来，使全民义务植树运动和造林绿化工作有一个突破性的进展。
    关于今后一个时期造林绿化工作的基本任务，要着重抓好以下几个方面：第一，深入开展义务植树运动。适龄公民每年每人植树３—５株，这是法定的义务，必须完成，要按规定落实任务。全国适龄公民约７亿人，按每人每年栽３—５株的要求，每年应植树２１亿—３５亿株，折成造林面积为１０００万—１７００万亩。各地要把义务植树指标，层层分解，逐级落实下去。第二，进一步搞好铁路、公路、渠道两旁和湖泊、水库周围及工矿区、农牧渔场、部队营区的绿化，包括各系统的企业、单位所负责的荒山、荒地、荒滩的绿化，都要按照有关规定和要求，认真做好规划，分期完成绿化任务。煤炭、造纸和其它以木材为原料的大型企业，要提取一定数额的育林费，分期分批建立各自的原材料林基地。第三，在抓好面上义务植树和部门造林的同时，要重点抓好速生丰产用材林基地和五大防护林体系建设，因地制宜地发展薪炭林和经济林，加快林业发展的步伐。第四，城市绿化要继续向纵深发展。要以建设大环境绿化为中心，积极开展郊区绿化。沿海开放城市要进一步加快绿化步伐，县城、建制镇的绿化要提上议事日程，各单位的庭院、厂区、校园、居民区等要积极绿化，进一步改善工作和生活环境。第五，在绿化工作中，要因地制宜，乔灌草相结合，安排好种草任务。特别是在荒漠戈壁、干旱、半干旱和水土流失严重的地区，要草灌先行，才能取得理想的绿化效果。
    根据今后一个时期绿化工作的要求，今年的工作任务是十分艰巨的。各级绿化委员会一定要加强领导，精心组织，做好各项工作，特别是要注意抓好以下几项工作：
    （一）全面制定义务植树和部门造林绿化规划。要确定到１９９０年、１９９５年、２０００年三个阶段的奋斗目标。这是保证义务植树运动和造林绿化工作持续、健康发展的关键，也是实行领导干部任期绿化目标责任制的前提条件。各地的义务植树规划，要与整个造林绿化规划有机地结合起来，成为其中的重要组成部分。各地、各部门、各单位要层层制定义务植树规划，按照适龄公民人数，落实义务植树任务，落实地块，落实苗木等一系列配套措施。部门的造林绿化规划，要与地方的造林绿化规划相衔接。各部门要根据各自的特点，抓紧编制本系统的造林绿化规划，并按系统向下分解，纳入各省（区、市）的造林绿化规划。同时要对本系统的绿化标准、资金渠道、完成年限、领导责任等作出明确的规定。煤炭、轻工造纸和以木竹为原料的部门、企业，要制定出建立原料林基地的规划。要积极走联合造林的路子，林业部门要为各行业营造原材料林基地，搞好服务，创造条件。联合造林对国家、地方、部门都有好处，对这个问题，地方和部门都要从全局出发，统筹规划，采取积极措施，今年在这方面应当有新的突破。
    今后全国绿化委员会检查各地、各部门的绿化工作，很重要的一条是看是否有规划，规划是否层层落实，并按规划具体组织实施了。这也是考核各地绿化办工作的重要内容。
    （二）依法兴林，狠抓落实。深入开展全民义务植树运动，作好发动工作，是必要的，但是很重要的一方面是做到依法兴林。各地区、各部门要认真执行全国人大的决议和国务院的实施办法及有关绿化法规，因地制宜制定配套措施。要按规定下达造林任务，并且因地制宜地把３—５株植树任务进一步具体化，按照规划落实到各单位、各乡村，直至到人。对无故不履行义务的单位和个人，要根据各地的经济发展水平，制定经济处罚的标准。总之，要做到有章可循，并坚决执行。
    （三）重视科学技术，加强管理，提高造林质量。目前，有些地方植树造林存在的最突出问题是质量差，管理不善，成活率低。这种状况，必须采取措施加以改变。
    植树造林要提高质量和效益，首先，必须讲科学。当前我们的植树造林，仍未摆脱粗放经营的传统模式，在群众性义务植树方面，表现更为突出。为提高造林绿化的实际效益，必须重视科学技术，实行科学管理。要按科学规划进行施工，在育苗、栽植、抚育、管护等方面，都要制定标准，按技术操作规程去做。对较大片的造林，要按设计施工，有条件的要按工程造林的办法去做，切实保证植树造林质量，真正作到管栽管活。同时要切实搞好抚育，促进林木的生长。要逐步建立义务植树档案，切实保护好义务植树成果。
    植树造林，不是为了给人看的，不是为了报数字的，必须办实事，求实效，不搞形式主义。对造林绿化必须坚持检查验收，据实上报，这要形成一项严格制度。检查验收，不仅要表扬好的，也要批评差的。一方面抓任务落实，一方面抓检查验收。这是两个密切相连的关键环节，必须作为各级绿化办的重点工作，紧紧抓住不放。义务植树没有成活的，不能算尽了义务，要限期补栽。
    （四）切实做好林业“三防”工作。发展林业，要实行加快培育、加强保护、合理利用的方针。就是说，一方面要大力植树造林，加强培育，加快林业发展，另一方面要严格控制森林资源消耗，不许突破采伐限额。林地树木和城市园林绿地，要严格管护，不得借故破坏和侵占；对无视规定，随意破坏树木，侵占林地和绿地的，要认真查处，及时纠正。目前，森林火灾、森林病虫害和乱砍滥伐是林业的“三大灾害”，在一些地方相当严重。针对这种情况，各地一定要切实搞好“三防”。要贯彻以预防为主的方针，建立健全“三防”管理体系，完善防治措施。对森林火灾，要按照国务院的规定，建立健全防火组织，实行各级领导负责制，做到“预防为主，积极消灭”。对病虫害，要采取有力措施，加强检疫和防治工作，实行综合治理，切实保护好林业资源。对乱砍滥伐、乱捕滥猎，地方各级政府和有关部门，一定要严明法纪，强化管理，消除各种诱因，防止发生问题，一旦发生了，要立即查处，加以制止。
    （五）加强宣传教育工作。宣传发动是推动林业发展和绿化建设的一个重要环节，各地、各部门要切实搞好。过去的绿化宣传工作是有成绩的，但还不如计划生育、交通安全宣传工作那样广泛。今年是建国四十周年，又是植树节十周年，要抓住这个有利时机，搞好宣传工作。大力宣传植树造林是保护国土，改善生态环境，有益当代，造福子孙的伟大事业；宣传育林育人是两个文明建设的一项战略措施；宣传义务植树的法定性、公益性、全民性。要造成强大的社会舆论，做到家喻户晓，人人皆知，使全体公民进一步提高认识，提高参加义务植树的自觉性和积极性，使广大干部群众树立起绿化祖国人人有责，参加义务植树光荣，不履行义务可耻的社会风尚。广播、电视、报刊等要加强绿化宣传工作。宣传形式要多种多样，引人入胜，讲求效果。
    开展全民义务植树运动以来，在亿万人民群众参加改造自然的伟大斗争中，涌现出大量的绿化先进单位、积极分子和劳动模范。各地、各部门和各单位，对绿化任务完成得好的，要给予表扬和奖励，宣传他们的事迹。全国绿化委员会将设立“全国绿化奖章”。每年植树节，对全国各地在绿化中做出优异成绩的个人，颁发“全国绿化奖章”，以鼓舞和动员人民，推进绿化祖国的群众运动深入持久地向前发展。
    今年的植树造林时节已经到来，植树活动正在由南向北逐渐展开。南方要立即行动起来，其它地方要提前作好各项准备工作。要不失时机地抓紧抓好春季植树造林，使今年的造林绿化和全民义务植树在数量上、质量上有一个突破性的进展。
    同志们！从现在起到本世纪末，还有１２年的时间。让我们知难而进，坚持不懈，把植树造林、绿化祖国的群众运动一年一年地扎扎实实地抓下去，积１２年的努力，在实现我国国民生产总值翻两番的同时，使广阔的中华大地锦绣万里，更加秀美！
