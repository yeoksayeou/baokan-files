The Seven-Party Alliance: Officially known as the "Afghanistan Mujahideen Islamic Alliance," it was established on May 16, 1985. It consists of seven resistance organizations based in Peshawar, Pakistan. Among them, the "Islamic Party," the "Afghanistan Islamic Society," and the "Islamic Union for the Liberation of Afghanistan" are considered hardliners, while the "Islamic National Front," the "Islamic National Liberation Front," and the "Islamic Revolutionary Movement" are seen as moderates. These seven organizations are the strongest in the Afghan anti-Soviet armed resistance. The "Supreme Council" is the highest authority of the alliance, composed of three main leaders from each party. The alliance has only one chairman, who is rotated among the main leaders of each party every three months. The current chairman is Zabihullah Mujaddidi. All seven parties are Sunni Muslim resistance organizations.

The Eight-Party Alliance: Established on September 16, 1987, it claims to have 100,000 armed personnel and mainly operates in the central and western regions of Afghanistan, including Bamiyan, Herat, and six other provinces. All eight member parties are Shia Muslim resistance organizations. The headquarters of the eight parties are located in Tehran, Iran, with branches in Zahedan, Mashhad, and other cities. The current leader of the Eight-Party Alliance is A. Khalili. The eight member parties are: "Victory Organization," "Islamic Holy Warriors," "Islamic Movement," "Islamic Party," "Party of God," "Islamic Revolutionary United Front," "Islamic Voice," and "Islamic Power." The leaders of the Eight-Party Alliance are all clerics.

The People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan: Established on January 1, 1965. At the first party congress, Taraki was elected as the general secretary, and Karmal as the central secretary. In 1967, an internal split occurred, with Karmal and a few others forming the "Flag faction" of the People's Party, while Taraki's People's Democratic Party was known as the "People's faction." On April 27, 1978, Taraki launched a military coup, overthrowing the Daoud regime. Shortly after taking power, internal conflicts resurfaced as the two factions vied for control. Eight key leaders of the Flag faction were sent abroad as ambassadors and expelled from the party in November of the same year, leaving the People's faction in sole control. However, on September 16, 1979, an internal power struggle within the People's faction resulted in the assassination of Taraki by Prime Minister and Defense Minister Hafizullah Amin, who then seized power. On December 27, 1979, the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, overthrowing Amin's regime. Karmal returned to the country under Soviet protection to serve as the party's general secretary, chairman of the Revolutionary Council, and prime minister. On May 4, 1986, Najibullah, a key figure in the Flag faction, replaced Karmal as the party and government's general secretary and chairman of the Revolutionary Council. Since Najibullah's rise to power, internal party conflicts have remained intense. The struggle between the Flag faction and the People's faction has never ceased. Reports indicate that the party currently has 180,000 members.

Mohammad Zahir Shah: The former king of Afghanistan, now 75 years old. He ascended to the throne in 1933 and ruled Afghanistan for 40 years. On July 17, 1973, his cousin, former Prime Minister Daoud, took advantage of his absence in Italy for eye treatment to launch a military coup, overthrowing the Zahir Shah dynasty. Since then, he has been in exile in Rome. After the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan in December 1979, he has repeatedly issued statements and speeches expressing his willingness to stand with the Afghan Mujahideen to fight for national independence. Recently, he has once again expressed his willingness to return to Afghanistan and serve his country after the Soviet troops withdraw.
