Salvadoran guerrillas proposed on February 7 to the government army that both sides negotiate a 60-day ceasefire before and after the elections. This is to ensure that the elections can be held without "suppression" and without the presence of soldiers.

The Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, the guerrilla organization, also demanded that the government army take a stance on the guerrillas' proposal to postpone the election date. The guerrillas had previously proposed on January 24 to the Salvadoran government to postpone the originally scheduled March 19 elections by half a year. The ruling Christian Democratic Party of El Salvador expressed acceptance of the guerrillas' proposal on February 3, but the military has yet to respond.

　  萨游击队向军方提出停火建议
    萨尔瓦多游击队七日向政府军建议，双方就在大选前后停火六十天问题进行谈判，以使选举在没有“镇压”和“没有军人出现”的情况下举行。
    游击队组织法拉本多·马蒂民族解放阵线总指挥部还要求政府军就游击队推迟大选日期的建议表明立场。游击队在一月二十四日曾向萨政府提出将原订三月十九日的大选推迟半年举行。萨尔瓦多执政的基督教民主党二月三日表示接受游击队的建议，但军方至今未表态。
