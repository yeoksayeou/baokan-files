    Leading the Masses in Flood Relief and Disaster Rescue: Selfless and Dedicated, Sacrificing Family for the People

    Hao Yuzhu Awarded "Outstanding Communist Party Member" by the Shanxi Provincial Committee

    Xinhua News Agency reports: Reporter Wang Aisheng reports: Recently, the Shanxi Provincial Committee made a decision to award Hao Yuzhu, deputy secretary of the Yangcheng Township Party Committee in Fenyang County, the title of "Outstanding Communist Party Member." Hao Yuzhu, in the autumn of 1988, led the masses in fighting against the floods, demonstrating selflessness and dedication, sacrificing his family for the people, fully embodying the true colors of a Communist Party member.

    In late July and early August 1988, Fenyang County experienced a major flood. Tens of thousands of houses were submerged, and thousands of families were trapped by the floodwaters. As the deputy secretary of the Yangcheng Township Party Committee, Hao Yuzhu was responsible for leading the villagers of Dian Tun, Jin Tun, and Xiaoguo City in flood relief and rescue efforts. He worked day and night on the front lines. His own village, Haizi Bian, was also hit by the flood, but he passed by his home twice without entering. On August 6, while organizing the villagers to move to higher ground and helping to rescue an elderly person who had fallen into the water, the floodwaters swept away Hao Yuzhu's home, destroying all his belongings. His 38-year-old wife, Liu Yuexian, and his 10-year-old daughter, Xiaoxueping, were both taken by the waves, losing their lives. The area Hao Yuzhu was responsible for flood control remained safe, and more than 7,600 people were unharmed.

    The Shanxi Provincial Committee's decision states: Comrade Hao Yuzhu is an excellent party member and cadre who has emerged in the new historical period. His actions reflect the lofty ideals and noble moral qualities of a Communist Party member.

    After Hao Yuzhu's deeds became known throughout Shanxi Province, they were widely praised. Hao Yuzhu said, "To be honest, I haven't done anything extraordinary. It's just that my losses were too great, making it stand out." "As a party member, I only did what a party member should do." "I have become a news figure, but I am still me. I just hope that society at large will not ridicule me as a fool and understand the sacrifices I made during the flood relief efforts. As for the future, it's the same old saying: party members should do what party members should do."

　　带领群众抗洪救灾　公而忘私　舍家为民
　　郝玉珠被山西省委授予“优秀共产党员”称号
    本报讯  记者王艾生报道：前不久，中共山西省委作出决定，授予汾阳县阳城乡党委副书记郝玉珠同志“优秀共产党员”称号。郝玉珠在１９８８年秋季带领群众与洪水搏斗中，公而忘私，舍家为民，充分表现共产党员的本色。
    １９８８年７月下旬８月上旬，汾阳县发生特大洪水，上万间房屋被淹没，数千户人家被洪水围困。身为阳城乡党委副书记的郝玉珠，负责带领该乡的田屯、靳屯和小虢城三个村群众抗洪抢险，日以继夜坚守在第一线。他所住的海子边村，也遭受洪水袭击，他曾两次临近家门不入。８月６日正当他组织群众向高处转移，并和群众一起奋力救起落水老人时，洪水吞没了郝玉珠的家，财产被荡涤一空，３８岁的妻子刘月仙和１０岁的独生女儿小冬萍被恶浪卷走，夺去生命。郝玉珠负责防汛的地段安然无恙，７６００余名群众无一伤亡。
    山西省委的决定说：郝玉珠同志是在新的历史时期成长和涌现出来的好党员、好干部。他的行为，体现了一个共产党员崇高的思想境界和高尚的道德品质。
    当郝玉珠的事迹在山西省传开之后，得到人们普遍的称赞。郝玉珠却说：“平心而论，我并没有什么惊天动地的大事情，只不过我的损失太大，才显出来的。”“作为一个党员，我只作了一个党员要做的事情”，“我成了新闻人物，但我还是我，我只希望社会各界不要嘲笑我是傻子，对于我在抗洪救灾中作出的牺牲加以理解。至于以后，还是那句老话，党员要做党员的事。”
