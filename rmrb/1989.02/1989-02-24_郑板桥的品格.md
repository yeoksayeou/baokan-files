Recently, I read the collection "Zheng Banqiao's Extracurricular Works" edited by Zheng Bingchun. This is a collection of Zheng Banqiao's poems and writings, compiled and written by himself in his early years, in addition to the "Complete Works of Zheng Banqiao." This collection, along with the "Complete Works of Zheng Banqiao" edited by Bian Xiaoxuan in 1985, are the most comprehensive collections of Zheng Banqiao's literary works in recent years. They provide valuable resources for future research on Zheng Banqiao himself and the cultural and intellectual thought of the mid-Qing Dynasty.

In Yangzhou, a place of commercial prosperity at that time, the wealth of merchants was sufficient to support a group of non-mainstream literary and artistic thinkers. Thus, figures like Zheng Banqiao, known as the "Eight Eccentrics of Yangzhou," as well as Hang Daizong, Hui Dong, and Quan Zhuwang emerged. In his poems, letters, and folk songs, Zheng Banqiao openly expressed his personal views on life and the world without any reservations. He was more candid than ordinary scholars. When writing letters and painting for others, he proposed, "It is better to give white silver than gifts or food" ("Banqiao's Price List"). He found it troublesome to be asked for paintings, "A letter comes, a topic is given, or a poem is requested, or a signature is required. I am not a performer on the stage, how can I twist and turn to please others?" ("From the Office in Weixian to Qin Qutian"). Even today, artists still face this contradiction with social customs. He opposed the personal rule of emperors, "Heaven creates the people and establishes the ruler; the people are noble, the ruler is light!" ("Reply to Bao Qiuxi in Fanxian"). He criticized the privileged class: "At the beginning, one might not be able to shine brightly in the world... But if you look through the Twenty-Four Histories, in every dynasty, there are only a few who leave a name" ("Sending a Message to Bu"). He wrote to his wife, opposing the pursuit of wealth and status for his descendants, "I do not want my descendants to seek power and riches in the future... If fortune comes, they will be promoted in rank, if fortune goes, they will suffer defeat and disgrace." He dared to order a small boat to ram a large official's banquet boat, causing a big trouble, but in the end, he won a great victory and extorted 300 taels of silver from the official to distribute to the poor along the lake ("Letter to Wang Menglou"). These texts are indeed readable.

People have two sides, and Zheng Banqiao is no exception. His calligraphy and painting, in order to cater to the tastes of the wealthy salt merchants of Yangzhou at that time, are not of the highest quality. But he was able to reveal his true self, and in his poems and writings, he could express his true feelings. Despite the limitations of the times, the headgear-like, scholarly, worldly, and playful attitudes of traditional scholars, with a mix of Confucian and Taoist thoughts, often appear, but this is also the characteristic of Zheng Banqiao—candid expression, making it a good article.

　　郑板桥的品格
    黄苗子
    近读郑炳纯同志辑的《郑板桥外集》，是板桥早年自辑自写的《板桥全集》以外，搜集板桥诗文较多的一本专集。此集和卞孝萱同志１９８５年辑的《郑板桥全集》，是近年来搜集板桥诗文著作较为丰富的两个本子，为今后研究板桥本人及清代中期文化思想提供了资料。
    在当时扬州这个商业繁荣的地方，由于商人的豪富，足以养活一批具有非正统观念的文艺思想家。因此产生像郑板桥那样的“扬州八怪”以及杭大宗、惠栋、全祖望等文人。板桥在诗文、书札、道情中，毫无顾忌地暴露他个人的人生观世界观。他比一般文人坦率，他给人写字画画，提出“凡送礼物食物，不如以白银为妙”（《板桥润格》），他以被人索画为苦，“一纸传来，出题点索，或要题诗，或要题款。我非戏台上之俳优（戏子），岂能宛转依人，任他点戏乎！”（《潍县署中寄靳秋田》），直到今天，艺术家还有这种社会风气扞格的矛盾。他反对个人集权的帝皇，“天生民而立之君，民为贵，君为轻！”（《范县答鲍匡溪》）。他针砭特殊阶层人物：“初当未必不煊赫一世……但试翻二十四史来看看，每一朝代之留名人物，总共只有哪几个。”（《寄音布》）。他写信给他的妻子，反对为子孙图富贵，“我不愿子孙将来取势位富厚……运来则加官晋爵，运去则身败名裂”。他敢于叫小艇去撞大官的歌宴游船，惹了大祸，但结果大获全胜，还敲了大官３００两银子散给沿湖贫民。《与王梦楼书》）。这些文字，确实有可读性。
    人总有两面性，板桥亦不例外，他的书法和绘画，为了迁就当时扬州盐商富人的口味。品格上也不是最上乘的。但他能够不掩饰自己，诗文集中，能道出自己的真性情，尽管由于时代的局限，头巾气、道学气、尘俗气、玩世态度等一般传统文人的儒、道错杂思想，都不断浮现出来，但这也正是板桥的特点，率真抒发，就不失为好文章了。
