In December 1941, after more than four years of invading China, the Japanese aggressors suddenly launched a sneak attack on Pearl Harbor, triggering the Pacific War. Hong Kong was on the brink of falling. Six hours before the airport fell into the hands of the Japanese army, Song Qingling boarded the last plane, leaving Hong Kong amidst the smoke and chaos, and flew to Chongqing, then the seat of the National Government.

Hong Kong was where Song Qingling had fought for anti-Japanese resistance and national salvation for four years. There, she established the "China Defense League," building a bridge of friendship to support the Chinese people's war of resistance against Japan. Just as donations from abroad and fundraising activities in Hong Kong were gaining momentum, the merciless bombardment forced the work to halt. Song Qingling's heart was heavy. In the emergency, she convened the last meeting of the China Defense League's Central Committee in Hong Kong at Westmoreland Road. At the meeting, she proposed to share hardships with everyone. However, this was unimaginable. Under the unanimous persuasion and request of her colleagues, she decided to take the plane to Chongqing. Although she would not forget the political chasm between her and the National Party's diehards, which had deepened in recent years, she had severely condemned Chiang Kai-shek's launch of the Anhui Incident at the beginning of the year, undoubtedly a blow to their heads; in July, to commemorate the fourth anniversary of the war of resistance, the New China Daily published her article, which was suppressed by the Chongqing authorities... All signs indicated that this time she would face a more severe situation in Chongqing. However, she firmly believed that light would always triumph over darkness. When the anti-Japanese cause required her to take this step, she calmly made the decision. Before her departure, she firmly declared:

"Wherever we are, we must rebuild our league. The work of the league must continue!"

In Adversity, Fighting for "Freedom Within a Room"

Chongqing was shrouded in a suffocating political atmosphere. Anti-Japanese progressive forces were in a perilous and chaotic environment. The fascist slogan of "one leader, one party" was rampant. The National Party diehards were stationed in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, brewing the third wave of anti-communist campaigns, and the anti-Japanese united front was facing the danger of splitting.

Song Qingling's arrival made Chiang Kai-shek uneasy. To isolate Song Qingling from the outside world, they "arranged" for her to stay at the home of Kong Xiangxi, then the Minister of Finance of the National Government, and his wife Song Ailing. They also dispatched a group of secret agents to constantly monitor her, depriving her of the freedom to go out and meet friends. However, the news of Song Qingling's arrival in Chongqing spread quickly. Some upright National Party elders felt that this treatment of Madame Sun was unacceptable. Under their urgent request, Lin Sen, the Chairman of the National Government, presided over a tea party in the National Government Hall to welcome her. About 100-200 members of the National Party Central Committee attended, but Chiang Kai-shek did not. Tan Zhen, representing many of the attendees, said with tears, "Welcome, Madame Sun, to speak. Madame Sun is the most democratic, and we respect her the most." Song Qingling stood up to speak amidst applause. She emphasized the need to unite and fight to the end, to implement democracy, and criticized those who claimed to be loyal followers of Dr. Sun Yat-sen but were actually his traitors. Song Qingling, who rarely shed tears, also couldn't help but cry when she was moved. Her righteous and stern speech made many National Party Central Committee members present stand in awe and be moved.

Many progressive figures and international friends were deeply concerned about Song Qingling's situation after her arrival in Chongqing. Deng Yingchao, one of the leaders of the CPC South Bureau, requested to visit Song Qingling and was finally "arranged" to do so. When the two friends met, Song Qingling hinted, "Be cautious in our conversation; someone is monitoring us." Although they couldn't speak their minds, they understood the truth. Soon, Zhou Enlai, representing the South Bureau, reported to the CPC Central Committee, listing 109 anti-communist measures taken by the National Party at that time. Among them was one reflecting Song Qingling's situation, stating:

"Madame Sun lives in the Kong family, not only unable to see guests but also under surveillance in her living room, with someone living there under the pretext of insufficient housing. Whenever there is a mass meeting, they deliberately push Madame Sun to be the chairperson, but do not notify her, intending to disappoint the masses." Later, through Song Qingling's efforts and the help of her brother Song Ziwen, she finally left the Kong family and moved into the residence at No. 3, Xincun, Erlu. Although the residence was surrounded by ruins of walls and buildings after being bombed by enemy planes, and there were still National Party secret agents monitoring the area, she at least gained "freedom within a room."

"Xincun No. 3" thus became the base for Song Qingling to carry out her work. In the difficult and complex environment, she used her legal status and various favorable conditions, employing clever working methods, relying on her great wisdom and courage, to unite a group of domestic and foreign friends. In Chongqing, she carried out effective anti-Japanese and national salvation work for four years, adding another glorious chapter to her great life.

The League Continues to Act

In August 1942, some members of the league gradually arrived in Chongqing from Hong Kong, and enough committee members had gathered. Song Qingling reorganized the Central Committee of the China Defense League. At her request, Zhou Enlai sent a telegram to Macao, bringing Liao Mengxin to Chongqing to continue serving as her secretary. At that time, those who often worked with Song Qingling included the German friend Wang Anna.

The reorganized league's mission remained to obtain assistance from within and outside the country, using funds, medicine, and materials, focusing on supporting the border areas and anti-Japanese bases behind enemy lines. Since 1941, the anti-Japanese bases had been in a difficult period. Not only did they face the main force of the Japanese invaders, but they also suffered from the blockade by the National Party's army, severely lacking in weapons, ammunition, and medical supplies. The assistance and military equipment provided by the United States to China under the Lend-Lease Act did not reach the bases behind enemy lines. Some foreign aid organizations in Chongqing, influenced by the National Party government, also did not provide assistance to the anti-Japanese bases. Facing this desperate situation, Song Qingling firmly demanded the lifting of the "inhumane blockade." In her 1943 open letter to "Chinese Friends Abroad" and the league's work report "In the Guerrilla Areas of China," she appealed, "Do not remain silent about the blockade." She said that the league focused its assistance on the anti-Japanese bases because "they almost entirely rely on equipment seized from the enemy to arm themselves, tying down more than 60% of the Japanese troops in China." "But they have not received any weapons, money, or medical aid for three years, which is particularly relevant to our work." "We do not ask for preferential treatment, but equal treatment." Her call attracted the attention of the international public opinion.

Through Song Qingling's efforts, the league finally restored contact with foreign aid organizations and progressive figures. Among them were the American China Aid Committee, the New York Joint China Aid Committee, aid organizations from the United States and other countries, particularly receiving aid from the American labor organization. The league also established good relations with officials from the American Red Cross in Chongqing, the American Medical Aid to China Association, and other organizations. Together, they fought with the National Party government to adjust the exchange rate. This somewhat compensated for the imbalance caused by a 50-200 fold increase in prices while the exchange rate only increased fourfold.

To avoid interference from the National Party's Social Affairs Bureau and sabotage by secret agents, the league often had to ask foreign friends to help withdraw funds from the bank. For example, Kong Xiangxi's American advisor Adler once helped Liao Mengxin withdraw a large sum of money from the bank. Adler was the American representative of the Stabilization Fund Committee, which managed American aid to China. He cooperated well with Ji Chaojun, who was then working at the Research Department of the Central Bank, so Liao Mengxin successfully withdrew cash for the league. John Foster, a member of the Central Committee of the league and an American friend, also took on the task of withdrawing funds. There were times when he took some remittances from the United States to the Central Bank and, through a cashier who had once been his student, completed the exchange procedure. The cash was in a large suitcase, and at the corner of the bank, a car from the Eighth Route Army Office was waiting for him. The cash was transported to Song Qingling's house, and everyone sat around the tea table to count the money. As usual, Song Qingling kindly invited everyone to have tea and snacks. These funds, except for a small portion designated by the donors, were all allocated by Song Qingling to the most urgent anti-Japanese bases. Transporting materials to the bases behind enemy lines through the National Party's strict military blockade lines was also a difficult task. These materials included surgical instruments and medicines for the troops, cod liver oil and milk powder for children, and blankets, gloves, and clothes for frontline soldiers. The league used all available transportation conditions, including cars and American planes traveling between Yan'an and Chongqing, to transport materials; asked international friends to help transport; or had the representatives of the Eighth Route Army negotiate the transport.

Song Qingling also received friendly cooperation from General Joseph Stilwell, who was then the commander of the China-Burma-India Theater and the Chief of Staff of the China Theater. Stilwell admired the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army's brave resistance against Japan and had great respect for Song Qingling. He agreed to let American military planes transport some relief supplies for the league to Yan'an. In 1944, a large X-ray machine was donated from abroad, making it difficult to transport to Yan'an. Song Qingling asked Liao Mengxin to find Stilwell's aide, Colonel Yang Mengdong, for help. Stilwell agreed to use the plane of the American Military Observation Group stationed in Yan'an. He feared that the longer it took, the more trouble there would be, so he ordered the plane to be modified immediately, loaded the X-ray machine, and flew to Yan'an. This was the first large X-ray machine in the anti-Japanese base with a population of nine million. It is now on display in the exhibition room of the Song Qingling Memorial in Beijing.

Through the hard work of Song Qingling and the members of the league, during their stay in Chongqing, they provided at least sixty-five thousand US dollars and 170 million yuan to the International Peace Hospital. In 1943, the International Peace Hospital received materials sent by the league, which, although less than a ton, were precious surgical instruments and sulfa drugs. In May 1942, the Los Angeles Nursery in Yan'an was established using donations from the Los Angeles China Aid Group provided by the league. In her December 1945 "Declaration of the China Defense League," Song Qingling said to the friends who had supported us in the war of resistance against Japan: "This support is no less important than the support provided by airplanes, tanks, and guns."

In Chongqing, news and publishing were suppressed by the authorities, and the league did not have the conditions to publicly print and publish its own books and periodicals, making it impossible to mail large amounts of materials abroad. Song Qingling insisted on writing letters, articles, materials, and work reports. Initially, using a typewriter given to her by the American friend Grace Granich, she repeatedly typed reports to donors. The 1943 work report of the league was a small booklet including several vivid materials, compiled in Chongqing and sent to New York for printing. Some materials were sent abroad to be published in magazines of the American and British China Aid Committees or friendly news agencies. Song Qingling often invited people from Yan'an and the anti-Japanese bases behind enemy lines to her home, listened to their experiences and feelings, and then wrote reports based on these rich and vivid materials, sending them abroad for publication. These accurate and reliable information dispelled the doubts of overseas friends and compatriots, encouraging their determination and confidence to support China's war of resistance.

Breaking Through the Silence of the Mountain City, Warming Hearts in Relief

War and natural disasters brought heavy suffering to the Chinese people. Henan suffered consecutive floods and droughts, with about five million people dying in 1942 alone. Guangdong and Hunan had hundreds of thousands of disaster victims waiting for relief. The National Party authorities, indifferent to the lives of the masses, deliberately blocked disaster information. Song Qingling was very indignant about this situation. Under her leadership, the league in Chongqing took on the tasks of propaganda and mobilization. To relieve the Henan and Guangdong disaster victims, two international organizations were established. Through volunteer workers and the British, American, and Soviet diplomatic and military institutions in Chongqing, drama performances and sports charity events were held, launching a series of relief activities.

In May 1943, Song Qingling, as the chairperson of the All-China Welfare Association, hosted three football charity matches with the efforts of committee members such as Xu Naibo. International friends and excellent teams gathered in the mountain city responded enthusiastically, with the "Dongping," "Huxing," "Yinglian" (British embassy and ship personnel), and "Hanqing" (Korean youth in Chongqing) teams participating in the competition. Despite the National Party secret agents' threats and intimidation, they could not stop the masses from coming to watch the games. Song Qingling and British Ambassador Sir Horace Seymour attended the opening ceremony together. Finally, they also presented commemorative flags and specially made badges to each team. This football match was unprecedented, and even today, the people of the mountain city still have vivid memories. The proceeds of thirteen thousand yuan from the match were all remitted to the Henan Disaster Relief Committee in Baoji, Shaanxi, to organize disaster relief and resettlement through the "Industrial Cooperative."

Song Qingling also considered that among the Henan disaster areas, there were twenty-nine counties in the guerrilla zones, and she fought for the rightful share of relief for the disaster victims there. She donated five hundred thousand US dollars from the New York American China Aid Committee to the local relief organizations led by the CPC.

To relieve the Guangdong disaster, Song Qingling hosted an international music charity performance in July 1943. The following February, she co-hosted a charity performance of the English play "Variety Show" with the wife of British Ambassador Sir Horace Seymour to raise thirty thousand yuan for the Guangdong disaster victims. In April, to raise funds for the Hunan disaster, she hosted an exhibition of ancient and modern calligraphy and paintings. Song Qingling herself donated a jewelry powder box for charity. Additionally, she specially invited famous dancer Dai Ailian and singer Si Yigui to hold a charity music concert. The proceeds of nearly fifty thousand yuan from the two events were all remitted to the Hunan disaster areas.

To help writers and cultural figures who were persecuted and harmed by the National Party authorities, in September 1944, Song Qingling hosted a charity evening for impoverished writers. The proceeds from the two-day performance, along with funds raised by the literary and art circles, totaled more than one hundred thousand yuan. This provided material assistance and spiritual encouragement to many progressive literary and art workers struggling in poverty and illness. The league was open about relief, strictly audited, thrifty, and used every penny for the service of disaster victims. Song Qingling herself continued to live a frugal life in Chongqing. Her friend, Wang Anna, who worked for the league for more than twenty years, said: "She wore clothes made of Sichuan nettle fabric when she went out. Abundant material life was usually disconnected from Madame Sun. Her two sisters had the habit of buying luxury goods from America by mail order, to which Madame Sun had once directly criticized." Once, in urgent need of money, she handed over some of her clothes to Liao Mengxin to exchange for money. She herself never accepted any extra money from any source. She always thought of the poverty and suffering of the broad masses. Edgar Snow once said that Song Qingling always stood with the CPC because the CPC represented the interests of the people, seeking the well-being of the people, not personal interests.

The Dark Clouds Cannot Obscure the Majestic Green Mountains

Song Qingling was a great politician with a high degree of independent thinking. Although she rarely went out, she closely watched the developments in domestic and international situations, analyzed and studied the situation from the information obtained, and made her own judgments. Liao Mengxin took the latest newspapers and magazines for her from the American News Agency every week. Working at the American News Agency were also members of the Central Committee of the league, including American "United Labor News" reporter Epstein, who was the editor of English news articles, and John Foster and Jin Zhonghua. Song Qingling also often communicated with officials from the British and American embassies and various people in Chongqing through foreign friends such as Wei Luoshi, Qiu Maoli, and Wang Anna. The Foreign Correspondents' Club in Chongqing had many reporters. Various channels could help Song Qingling understand the political, military, and economic situations at home and abroad.

Over the four years, Song Qingling maintained regular contact with the Eighth Route Army Office led by Zhou Enlai. Liao Mengxin was the liaison. On a winter night in 1942, Song Qingling held a dinner party at her residence to see off CPC representative Dong Biwu returning to Yan'an. Zhou Enlai, Deng Yingchao, Feng Yuxiang, Li Dequan, and others were invited. Everyone gathered around the warm stove, enjoying the gathering. Zhou Enlai talked about the achievements on the Northwest battlefield and the domestic and international situation. People imagined the day of the people's victory from the golden ears of wheat illuminated by the stove fire, leaving Song Qingling with an unforgettable impression.

Facing the military collapse of the National Party government and the intensified Japanese militarists' attempts to induce surrender, the country was in danger of the war of resistance being interrupted and the civil war being reopened. Song Qingling clearly expressed her political views, directing her criticism at the National Party diehards. She emphasized that China needed anti-fascist unity and people's democracy. She said that without unity, there would be no resistance against Japan, and without democracy, there would be no unity. She criticized those who hoped that the United States would fight Japan while they preserved their own army for the civil war. She wrote: "Throughout the existence of the league, it has emphasized unity. Now, when these achievements are overshadowed by ominous clouds, foreshadowing a new and suicidal civil war, we must emphasize this even more." "The Chinese reactionaries are preparing for this war, attempting to eliminate the democratic part of our struggle. These parts are in the Shaanxi-Ningxia Border Region and the bases behind enemy lines." In March 1943, to commemorate the anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's death, she criticized the National Party's dictatorship in a talk with reporters in Chongqing, pointing out: "The three policies of the late President should be implemented, a National Congress should be convened, and under the principle of absolute democracy, the masses of the nation should be mobilized to give them equal opportunities to participate in the war of resistance and national reconstruction. Equal opportunities should also be given to all parties and factions..." In 1944, she also spoke on "Sun Yat-sen and Chinese Democracy" in a radio broadcast for the United States on Sun Yat-sen Memorial Day, pointing out that "every country should have a government based on the interests of the people and the expression of their will."

Song Qingling actively supported the people's struggle for democratic rights and stood out at critical moments. On October 1, 1944, she participated in and personally attended the memorial service for Zhou Tiaofen held in Chongqing by various parties and strata. The National Party authorities not only destroyed the news reporting of this gathering but also deployed secret agents around the memorial site. However, there were still two to three thousand people from all walks of life and the masses who came to pay their respects. Song Qingling arrived at the venue on time and listened calmly and quietly to everyone's speeches. Some were concerned about enemy sabotage, while others said they were not afraid, "Madame Sun is here, they dare not." Indeed, Song Qingling was like this. Her righteous and fearless actions, like saving the patriotic leader "Seven Gentlemen" in the past, still inspired the people and shocked the enemy.

The American Ambassador to China, Clarence Gauss, said in March 1944: "Except for Madame Sun, no one else in China dares to publicly expose the high-pressure policy, even if it is implied, they do not dare." When the American Vice President Wallace visited China in 1944, Song Qingling reiterated her views to him.

Because Song Qingling had written to some organizations, exposing the National Party's army's blockade of the CPC and demanding the lifting of the blockade, her relatives and high-ranking National Party officials were furious. Three National Party officials had visited her. They reprimanded her for "spreading groundless rumors" and "currying favor with foreigners," among other things. Song Qingling dismissed this as "childish preaching." This was written in a report by American official John S. Service after visiting Song Qingling in Chongqing in February 1944. At that time, several American organizations had invited Song Qingling to visit the United States, and she accepted the invitation. However, the National Party authorities bluntly informed her that she was not allowed to leave the country. Song Qingling disdainfully said: "The most they can do is prevent me from leaving the country."

Song Qingling had a tenacious and independent character, with a fearless spirit of pursuing truth. She despised hypocrisy, corruption, and deception, and fought against evil phenomena without mercy. She shared hardships and stood by her friends and the people. Her friends were all over the world. Louis E. Alley and many other foreign friends deeply respected her, calling her "an outstanding representative of beautiful and strong Chinese revolutionary women, like a flower that never withers." In August 1945, the war of resistance ended in victory for the Chinese people and the defeat of the Japanese militarists. Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai came to Chongqing for negotiations on the great cause of national unity. During the forty-three days in Chongqing, they met with Song Qingling several times, expressing their heartfelt respect for her unwavering adherence to the revolutionary three policies of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, her unyielding struggle against Chiang Kai-shek's fascist rule, and her noble revolutionary spirit of not caring for personal safety and dedicating herself to the country and the nation. They expressed the sentiments of the hundreds of millions of people in the country and their boundless admiration and love for her. Her deeds and virtues in Chongqing will forever be remembered by the people. This article is written to commemorate the 96th birthday of Comrade Song Qingling.

    1942——1945宋庆龄在重庆
    宋庆龄基金会
    1941年12月，日本侵略者在发动侵华战争四年多以后，又突然偷袭珍珠港，爆发了太平洋战争。香港濒临沦陷，在机场落入日军手中六小时之前，宋庆龄乘坐最后一架飞机，在硝烟弥漫中撤离香港，向当时国民政府所在地重庆飞去。
    香港，是宋庆龄为抗日救亡曾经奋斗了四年的地方。在那里，她创建了“保卫中国同盟”，为世界人民支援中国抗日战争架起了友谊的桥梁。正当来自国外的捐助和香港当地募捐活动形成热潮的时候，无情的炮火使工作被迫中断。宋庆龄的心情是沉重的。在紧急情况下，她在西摩道召开了保卫中国同盟在香港的最后一次中央委员会。会上，她提出要和大家一起共渡患难。但，这是不可想象的。在同事们的一致劝说和要求下，她才决定乘飞机去重庆。虽然她不会忘记她同国民党顽固派之间存在的政治鸿沟，而且近年来在日益深化。年初，她曾严厉谴责蒋介石发动皖南事变，无疑是对他们的当头一棒；七月，为纪念抗战四周年，《新华日报》发表她的文章，被重庆当局扣压……种种迹象表明她这次去重庆，面临的将是更严峻的处境。然而，她深信：光明总是会战胜黑暗。当抗日大业需要她迈开这一步时，她沉着地作出了决定。临行前，她坚定地表示：
  “不管在哪儿，我们也一定要重建我们的保盟。保盟的工作一定要继续下去！”①
    在逆境中争得“一楼之中的自由”
    重庆，笼罩着令人窒息的阴霾的政治气氛。抗日进步力量处在险恶和夏杂的环境中。“一个领袖，一个政党”的法西斯论调甚嚣尘上。国民党顽固派陈兵陕甘宁边区，正酝酿第三次反共高潮，抗日统一战线面临分裂的危险。
    宋庆龄的到来，使蒋介石惶惶不安。为了隔绝宋庆龄和外界的联系，他们把她“安排”住在当时国民政府财政部长孔祥熙和夫人宋蔼龄的家里，并派一班特务日夜周旋在她身边，没有外出和会见友人的自由。但是，宋庆龄到达重庆的消息还是不胫而走。一些正直的国民党元老，认为这样对待孙夫人太不像话。在他们迫切要求下，才由国民政府主席林森主持，在国府礼堂开了一个茶话会表示欢迎。参加者有国民党中委一二百人，蒋介石没有出席。覃振代表很多与会者的心意，一边流着眼泪一边说：“欢迎孙夫人给我们讲话。孙夫人是最民主的，是我们最敬佩的人。”宋庆龄在掌声中站起来讲了一席话。她强调必须团结抗战到底，必须实行民主，并指责有人名为中山先生的忠实信徒，实则是他的叛徒。素不轻易流泪的宋庆龄，说到激动处，也禁不住落了泪。她的义正辞严的讲话，使在场的不少国民党中委不禁肃然起敬，为之动容。②
  对于宋庆龄到重庆后的处境，许多进步人士和国际友人都极为关心。中共中央南方局领导人之一邓颖超要求拜访宋庆龄，好不容易才得到“安排”。当两友相见时，宋庆龄就暗示：“谈话谨慎，有人监视。”③这次拜访虽不能说心里话，却了解了真情。不久，周恩来代表南方局给中共中央的一份报告中，列举了一百零九条当时国民党的反共措施。其中就有一条反映宋庆龄的处境，说：
  “孙夫人住孔家，不仅不能见客，连其住屋内都借口房子不够，有人同住监视。每每群众会，故意推孙夫人为主席团，但并不通知本人，企图使群众失望。”④后来，经过宋庆龄的争取和她弟弟宋子文的帮助，她终于离开了孔家，搬进了两路口新邨三号的寓所。尽管寓所附近，都是一些被敌机轰炸后的断墙残壁；周围仍有国民党特务的监视，但她总算得到了“一楼之中的自由”。
      “新邨三号”从此成了宋庆龄开展工作的基地。在艰难复杂的环境中，她利用合法身份以及各种有利的条件，运用巧妙的工作方法，凭着她的大智大勇，团结一批国内外朋友，在重庆开展了为时四年的踏实有效的抗日救国工作，在她伟大的一生中，又写下了光辉的一页。
              保盟在继续行动
    1942年8月，保盟的部分成员陆续从香港来到重庆，已经集合了足够数量的委员。宋庆龄重组了保盟中央委员会。应宋庆龄的要求，周恩来打电报到澳门，把廖梦醒调到重庆，继续担任宋庆龄的秘书。当时，经常与宋庆龄一起工作的还有德籍友人王安娜。
    重组后的保盟，它的任务依然是向国内外取得援助，以资金、医药和物资，重点支援边区和敌后抗日根据地。从1941年以来，抗日根据地处在艰难的时期。不仅面对日本侵略军的主力，还遭到国民党军队的封锁，武器、弹药和医药用品严重缺乏。美国提供给中国的租借法案⑤的援助和军事装备，全部到不了敌后根据地。在重庆的有些外国援华机构，由于受国民党政府的影响也不给抗日根据地以援助。面对这种危急的形势，宋庆龄十分坚决地提出要求取消“不人道的封锁。”她在1943年《给中国在海外的朋友们的公开信》和《在中国游击区》的保盟工作报告中，呼吁：“不要对封锁默许。”她说，保盟之所以把援助的重点放在抗日根据地，是因为：“他们几乎全靠从敌人那儿夺得的装备武装自己，牵制了在华日军60％以上的部队。”“但是他们已经3年没有得到过任何武器和金钱的援助，以及与我们的工作特别有关的医药援助。”“我们并不要求给他们优先待遇，而是要求平等待遇。”她的呼声引起了国际舆论界的注目。
    经过宋庆龄的努力，保盟与国外的援华机构和进步人士终于恢复了联系。它们中有：美国援华会、纽约联合援华会、美国和其它国家的援华机构，尤其得到了美国劳工组织的援助。保盟还和驻重庆的美国红十字会，美国医药援华会等机构的官员们建立了良好的关系。并同他们一起，向国民党政府争取外汇率的调整。这样，略可补偿由于物价上涨50—200倍，而外汇率只涨四倍的不平衡的情况。⑥
    为了避免国民党社会局的干预和特务的捣乱，保盟向银行提取汇款的工作常常要请外国朋友帮助。为孔祥熙的美国顾问艾德勒曾帮助廖梦醒在银行提取了一笔巨款。艾德勒是管理美国援华款项的平准基金委员会的美方代表。他和当时在中央银行研究处工作的冀朝昆合作得很好，因此，廖梦醒为保盟顺利地提取了现金。⑦保盟中央委员、美国朋友约翰·福斯特，也分担过提款任务。曾有几次，他把一些来自美国的汇票拿到中央银行，通过一位曾是他学生的出纳员，办成兑换手续。钞票有一大皮箱，在银行的拐角处，一辆八路军办事处的车子在等着他。把钞票运到宋庆龄家里，大家就一起围坐在茶桌边点票子。照例，宋庆龄非常亲切地请大家用茶点。这些款项除极少数由捐助者指定捐助对象外，全由宋庆龄作主拨给最迫切需要的抗日根据地。给敌后根据地运送物资，要通过国民党的严密的军事封锁线，又是一件很不容易的事。这些物资包括给部队用的外科手术用具和药品，给孩子们的鱼肝油和奶粉；给前线战士的军毯、手套、衣服等。保盟利用一切可以利用的交通条件，包括来往于延安和重庆间的汽车和美国飞机运送物资；请国际友人帮助代运；或由八路军谈判代表带运。
    宋庆龄在重庆还得到了当时任中、缅、印联合战区指挥官、中国战区参谋长美国约瑟夫·史迪威将军的友好合作。史迪威对八路军、新四军英勇抗日深为敬佩，对宋庆龄也十分仰慕，他同意让美国军用飞机为保盟运送某些救济物资到延安。1944年，国外捐来一架大型X光机，难于运往延安，宋庆龄让廖梦醒去找史迪威的副官杨孟东上校，请予帮助。史迪威同意使用驻延安美军观察组的飞机。他怕夜长梦多，下令立刻改装飞机舱门，把X光机装进去，就飞往延安。⑧这是当时拥有九千万人口的抗日根据地的第一台大型X光机。它现在陈列在北京宋庆龄故居的展览室里。
    经过宋庆龄和保盟成员的艰苦工作，在重庆期间给国际和平医院的资助至少有六十五万美元和一亿七千多万元法币。⑨1943年国际和平医院收到保盟送去的物资，虽不到一吨，但都是珍贵的外科手术器械和磺胺药物。1942年5月，在延安建立的洛杉矶托儿所，是用保盟提供的美国洛杉矶援华团体的捐款。宋庆龄在1945年12月写的
  《保卫中国同盟声明》中，对在抗日战争中支援过我们的朋友们说：“这种支援对保卫中国的作用，不亚于以飞机、坦克和枪支的支援。”
      在重庆，新闻出版受当局压制，保盟更没有公开印刷和出版自己书刊的条件，不可能向国外邮寄大量资料。宋庆龄仍然坚持撰写书信、文章、资料和工作报告。起先，用美国友人格雷丝·格兰尼奇送给她的一台打字机，一次、二次地重复打出给捐款人的报告书。1943年保盟的工作报告，是一本包括几篇生动资料的小册子，是在重庆编成后送纽约印刷的。有的材料是送到国外，让美国、英国援华会的杂志或友好的通讯社发表。宋庆龄还经常请来自延安和敌后抗日根据地的人到她家里，向他们了解情况，听他们讲见闻、感受，然后根据这些丰富、生动的资料写成报道，寄往国外发表。这些确切可靠的信息，澄清了海外友人和侨胞们的一切疑虑，鼓舞了他们支援中国抗战的决心和信心。
          冲破山城沉寂　赈灾温暖人心
      战争和自然灾害给中国人民带来了沉重的苦难。河南连年遭到水旱灾害，仅1942年约有五百万人死亡。广东、湖南已有数百万灾民等待救济。国民党当局不顾广大灾民的死活，还蓄意封锁灾情。宋庆龄对此情况感到十分愤慨。在她领导下，保盟在重庆担负起宣传和动员工作。为救济河南和广东灾民，设立了两个国际组织。通过义务工作人员和英、美、苏在重庆的外交和军事机构，举行了戏剧义演和球类义赛，⑩开展一系列赈灾活动。
  1943年5月，宋庆龄以中华全国福利协会主席的身份，在许乃波等保盟中央委员们的努力筹备下，主办了三场足球义赛。国际友人和汇集在山城的优秀球队热烈响应，有“东平”、“沪星”、“英联”（英国使馆和军舰人员组成）、“韩青”（韩国在渝青年组成）四个球队参加比赛。尽管国民党特务四出活动，恐吓威胁，却阻挡不住群众前来观赛。宋庆龄和英国薛穆大使一起亲临开球。最后，还给各球队赠送了奖旗和特制的纪念章。这次球赛盛况空前，四十多年后的今天，山城群众，仍记忆犹新。球赛所得十三万元，全部汇给陕西宝鸡豫灾赈济委员会，通过那里的“工合”?，组织灾民生产自救和迁徙之用。宋庆龄还考虑到河南灾区中，有二十九个县是游击区，要为那里的灾民争得应有的援助份额，她把纽约美国援华会资助的五万美元，全部给了当地中共领导的救济机构。
    为了赈济粤灾，宋庆龄又在1943年7月举办国际音乐义演。第二年2月，又同英国薛穆大使夫人发起义演英语乐剧“杂耍”，为广东灾民募得三十万元。4月，为筹赈湘灾，举办了古今书画物品展览会。宋庆龄自己捐出一个珠宝粉盒义卖。另外，又特邀著名舞蹈家戴爱莲和歌唱家斯义桂等举行义演音乐会。两项收入近五十万元，全部汇给湖南灾区。
    为了帮助因受国民党当局摧残和迫害的贫病作家、文化人，1944年9月，宋庆龄主办援助贫病作家文艺晚会。两天演出所得收入连同文艺界筹募的款项共一百多万元。使许多在贫、病中挣扎的进步文艺工作者，得到了物质的援助和精神上的鼓舞。保盟在赈灾工作中公开赈目，严格审计，克勤克俭，把所得的每一文钱都用在为灾民服务。宋庆龄自己在重庆依然过着节俭的生活。她的友人，为保盟工作了二十多年的王安娜说：“她穿着四川产的荨麻织物做的衣服出门。丰裕的物质生活通常都与孙夫人绝缘。她的两个姐妹以函购方式从美国买进奢侈品已成习惯，孙夫人对此曾直率地提出批评。”?一次，为了急需用钱，她把自己的几件衣服交给廖梦醒去换钱。她自己绝不接受来自任何方面的分外钱财。她心中常想着广大人民的贫困和痛苦。埃德加·斯诺曾说，宋庆龄始终与中国共产党站在一起，是因为共产党代表了人民的利益，是为人民谋福利，而不是为私人谋利益的缘故。?
          乌云遮不住　青山自巍然
    宋庆龄是伟大的政治家，她有着高度的独立思考的能力。她虽然深居简出，但密切注视着国内外形势的动向，从获得的信息中，分析研究时局，作出自己的判断。廖梦醒每周从美国新闻处为她取来最新的报刊杂志。在美国新闻处工作的还有保盟中央委员、美国《联合劳动新闻》记者爱泼斯坦，他担任美新处英文新闻稿编辑。约翰·福斯特和金仲华也在那里工作。宋庆龄还通过外国朋友魏璐诗·邱茉莉、王安娜等经常与英美大使馆的官员们和驻重庆的各方面人士接触。重庆外国记者俱乐部有很多记者。各种渠道都可以帮助宋庆龄了解国际、国内的政治、军事、经济方面的情况。
      四年里，宋庆龄与周恩来领导的八路军办事处保持着经常的联系。廖梦醒就是联络员。1942年的一个冬夜，宋庆龄在寓所举行晚餐会，欢送中共代表董必武返回延安。周恩来、邓颖超、冯玉祥、李德全等应邀参加。大家围着融融炉火，相聚甚欢。周恩来谈了西北战场上的战绩和国内外形势。人们从被炉火照得金灿灿的麦穗上，畅想人民胜利之日，给宋庆龄留下了难以忘怀的印象。
    面对国民党政府军事上的大溃退，日本军国主义的加紧诱降，国家面临抗战中断、内战重开的危险，宋庆龄旗帜鲜明地表达了自己的政见，把批评矛头指向国民党顽固派。她强调中国需要反法西斯的团结和人民的民主。她说，没有团结就没有抗日，没有民主也就没有团结。她批评一些人希望美国去打日本而把他们自己的军队保存下来准备内战。她写道：“在保盟的整个存在的过程中，它强调团结。现在，当这些成果为不祥的阴影笼罩着，预兆着新的和自杀性的内战时，我们更要强调这一点。”?“中国反动派正在准备这种战争，企图消灭我们斗争中的民主部分。这些部分就是在陕北和敌后的根据地。”?（151943年3月，为纪念孙中山逝世，她在重庆对记者发表的谈话中，抨击了国民党专政，指出：“应该实现总理的三大政策，开国民会议，在绝对民主的原则下，动员全国群众，使他们都有同等的机会参加抗战建国工作。对各党各派，也应该给予同等的机会……”1944年她又在为美国举行的孙中山纪念日所作的广播演说中讲到“孙中山与中国民主”，指出“每一个国家内部要有一个建立在人民的利益与自由表达意志的基础上的政府。”  宋庆龄积极支持人民群众争取民主权利的斗争，在关键时刻挺身而出。1944年10月1日，她参与发起并亲自参加了各党派各阶层在重庆举行的邹韬奋先生追悼会。国民党当局对这一集会不仅在新闻报道上进行破坏，还在追悼会场周围密布特务。然而，仍有二三千各界人士和群众前来悼念。宋庆龄按时到达会场，她安详而沉静地谛听着大家讲话。有人担心敌人捣乱，也有人说不怕，“孙夫人都来了，他们不敢。”的确，宋庆龄就是这样，她大义凛然、无私无畏的行动，仍像过去营救爱国领袖“七君子”时那样，给人民以激励，而令敌人震慑。
    美国驻华大使高斯1944年3月曾经说：“除孙夫人外，没有任何中国人敢于公开揭露高压政策，即使含蓄地讲也不敢。”?当美国副总统华莱士1944年来华访问时，宋庆龄对他重申自己的主张。
    由于宋庆龄曾经致函一些团体，揭露国民党军队对共产党的封锁，并要求解除封锁。她的亲属和国民党高级官员对此大动肝火。有三位国民党要人曾经访问她。他们申斥她“散布毫无根据的谣言”、“取媚外人”等等。对此，宋庆龄斥之为“幼稚的说教”。这些是美国官员谢伟思1944年
  2月在重庆访问宋庆龄后，在报告中写的。当时美国有好几个团体邀请宋庆龄访问美国，她接受了邀请。但国民党当局直截了当地通知她，不允许她出国。宋庆龄蔑视地说：“他们所能做的，无非是阻止我出国。”?
    宋庆龄具有坚韧、独立的性格，有坚持真理的大无畏精神。她鄙视虚伪、腐化和欺骗，对丑恶现象的斗争毫不留情。对人民、对朋友患难与共、始终不渝。她的朋友遍天下。路易·艾黎和其他许多外国朋友都无比敬爱她，称她是一位“花朵般美丽、钢铁般坚强的中国革命妇女的杰出代表”，是“一朵永不凋谢的花”。1945年8月，抗日战争以中国人民的胜利和日本军国主义者的失败而告终。毛泽东、周恩来为祖国统一大业来到重庆谈判。在重庆的四十三天中，他们多次同宋庆龄会面，对她忠诚不渝地信守孙中山先生的革命三大政策，对她同蒋介石法西斯统治的不懈斗争，对她的不计个人安危，献身国家民族的高贵的革命气节，表示了由衷的敬意。?他们表达了全国亿万人民的心意和对她无限景仰的敬爱之情。她在重庆时期的懿德伟行永远铭记在人民心中。谨以此文纪念宋庆龄同志的九十六岁诞辰。
