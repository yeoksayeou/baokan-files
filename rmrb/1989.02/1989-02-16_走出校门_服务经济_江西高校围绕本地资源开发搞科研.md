Higher education institutions in Jiangxi Province have undertaken over 900 projects at various levels and of various types since last year, with 87% of these being applied research and development projects. Approximately 15,000 people are engaged in scientific and technological activities.

A notable feature of this activity is its alignment with the actual situation of developing the national economy, with a focus on the development of Jiangxi's resources, aiming to transform resource advantages into economic advantages. The achievement of "Catalytic Oxidation of Straw, Rice Husks, and Corn Stalks to Produce Oxalic Acid in One Step" by Qin Zhong, an associate researcher at Jiangxi University of Technology, and others, has the advantages of a short process, low energy consumption, minimal investment, and high product quality. It has opened up a new path for producing oxalic acid from the abundant waste fibers in Jiangxi. The achievement of the "Printing and Dyeing Pattern Preparation System" by Jiangxi Normal University and other units is at an internationally advanced level, providing modern means for the printing and dyeing industry to update and innovate its products.

Broadly speaking, teachers and technical personnel have stepped out of the campus to strengthen horizontal ties with production departments, which not only facilitates the achievement of scientific research results but also enables production departments to quickly increase economic benefits through the "magic" of scientific research. The achievement of "Comprehensive Utilization of Associated Elements in Jiangxi Copper Mines - Ion Exchange Method for Extracting Molybdenum and Rhenium (Pilot Test)" by scientific and technical workers at Jiangxi University has increased the annual profit of the First Chemical Factory in Gaoyao County by 668,000 yuan.

The scientific research achievements of Jiangxi's higher education institutions, combined with production practices, have attracted the attention of the international scientific community. The "Resistor-Oxide-Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor (ROS Tube)" developed by Professor Ye Anzuo of Jiangxi University won a gold medal at the International Invention Exhibition.

In supporting the old revolutionary base areas and technological poverty alleviation, scientific and technical workers from Jiangxi's higher education institutions have also done a great deal of work. Jiangxi Water Conservancy Vocational College provided "Hydraulic Testing and Modified Design of External Pipe Intake Gates for Medium and Small Reservoirs" for the agricultural machinery factory in Ninggang County, under the Jinggang Mountains. Within less than a month, the factory received orders for 500,000 units.

　　走出校门　服务经济    
    江西高校围绕本地资源开发搞科研
    本报南昌电  记者赵相如报道：江西省高等学校去年以来共承担各级各类课题９００多项，其中８７％是应用开发项目，投入科技活动的约有１．５万人。
    这一活动有个显著特点，就是结合发展国民经济的实际情况进行，重点围绕江西资源开发，使资源优势变为经济优势。江西工业大学秦中副研究员等人完成的“谷壳、稻草、玉米秆等为原料催化氧化一步法制草酸”成果，具有流程短、能耗低、投资少、产品质量高等优点，开辟了江西大量存在的废纤维制取草酸的新途径。江西师范大学等单位完成的“印染花型准备系统”成果属国际先进水平，为印染行业产品的更新换代、推陈出新提供了现代化手段。
    广大教师和科技人员走出校门，加强同生产部门的横向联系，既便于取得科研成果，也使生产部门通过科研的“魔法”迅速增加经济效益。江西大学科技工作者完成的“江西铜矿伴生元素综合利用研究——离子交换法提取钼和铼（中试）”成果，使高安县第一化工厂年增利润６６．８万元。
    江西高校结合生产实际取得的科研成果，受到国际科技界的关注。江西大学叶安祚教授研制的“电阻—氧化物—半导体场效应晶体管（ＲＯＳ管）”获国际发明展览金牌奖。
    在支援老区、科技扶贫方面，江西高校科技工作者也做了大量的工作。江西水利专科学校为井冈山下的宁冈县农机厂提供了“中小型水库外卧管进水拍门水力测试及改型设计”。在不到１个月的时间里，厂方就接到订货５０万台的任务。
