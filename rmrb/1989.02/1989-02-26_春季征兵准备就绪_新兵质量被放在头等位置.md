Spring Enlistment Preparations Complete, New Recruit Quality Prioritized

New recruits' quality is given top priority.

Xinhua News Agency reporters Gài Yùmín and this newspaper's reporter Luó Tóngsōng report from Beijing: According to a responsible person from the National Defense Ministry's Enlistment Office, this spring's enlistment preparations have been tightly organized and swiftly executed, showing a very good momentum.

It is reported that this year's enlistment has seen various regions prioritize ensuring the quality of new recruits. Many places have established a responsibility system for each position, strictly controlling each step of political examination and physical check-ups. Provinces such as Jílín, Jiāngsū, and Shāndōng have formulated enlistment work target management methods, assigning responsibilities to units and individuals. In provinces and municipalities like Héběi, Shānxī, Zhèjiāng, Fújiàn, Guìzhōu, and Shànghǎi, after clarifying the responsibility system, they have established reward and punishment measures. Provinces such as Húnán, Húběi, Guǎngdōng, Jiāngxī, Hénán, Sìchuān, Shǎnxī, and Gànsù have set up hotlines and mailboxes for reporting, accepting public supervision.

It is understood that young people of conscription age who have gone out to work or do business in various parts of the country are gradually returning to their hometowns to prepare for enlistment. The doors of the conscription offices are already bustling with young people eagerly signing up.
