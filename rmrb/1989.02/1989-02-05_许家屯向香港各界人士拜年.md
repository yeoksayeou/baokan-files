Xu Jiatun, Director of the New China News Agency's Hong Kong Branch, today addressed the people of Hong Kong to offer New Year greetings to people from all walks of life.

In his address, Xu Jiatun said that over the past year, Hong Kong's economy, after two years of double-digit growth, maintained a steady growth trend. Hong Kong society also made new progress, continuing to maintain a prosperous and stable situation. Social stability and economic development are mutually reinforcing. Only by maintaining long-term social stability can we guarantee high economic prosperity; at the same time, continuous economic development is beneficial for sustained social stability. Xu Jiatun wished that in the new year, the governments of China and Britain would further strengthen cooperation and better implement the Sino-British Joint Declaration. He also wished that people from all walks of life in Hong Kong would continue to improve the drafting of the Basic Law in a democratic and harmonious atmosphere of dialogue and consultation. He expressed his belief that Hong Kong compatriots, who have the tradition of "loving the motherland and loving Hong Kong," will pool their wisdom and, with their world-renowned creativity, make new contributions to promoting Hong Kong's stability, prosperity, and progress.
