A recent comprehensive survey of the physical condition of Chinese and Japanese youth has shown that the average height of Chinese youth in various age groups is higher than that of Japanese youth. However, in terms of indicators of robust physical development, Chinese youth generally fall short of their Japanese counterparts. For instance, Chinese males weigh 0.9 to 3.8 kilograms less, and females weigh 0.1 to 3.8 kilograms less. These "bean sprout" type youth have smaller chests, poorer heart and lung function, poor vision, and increasing rates of spinal curvature and neurasthenia.

Compared to Japanese youth, Chinese youth in various age groups have an average back muscle strength that is 3.5 to 25.1 kilograms lower, and their average performance in a five-minute run is 26 to 119 meters shorter. The physical condition and athletic ability of Chinese youth lag significantly behind those of developed countries and show a trend of widening disparity.

Of course, this is not the fault of the children themselves. While people are aware of the dangers of the frenzied pursuit of high admission rates and continually call for an end to this harmful "upgrading" behavior, in actual practice, the performance of schools, principals, and teachers is still measured by retention rates, pass rates, dropout rates, and admission rates, which are linked to bonuses. Principals, teachers, and parents work together to "confine" students indoors. Unable to withstand wind and rain, or see the sunlight, and gasping for breath after a few steps, this is the price children pay for improving their academic performance.

At a symposium in Beijing's Xicheng District, some physical education teachers pointed out the lack of understanding among some principals of primary and secondary schools regarding sports. Many principals focus on both high admission rates and the profit rates of school-run enterprises. Physical education teachers are powerless and can only allow other subject teachers to arbitrarily allocate and divide students' physical exercise time. Seven classes during the day and a large amount of homework force children to bury their heads in books all day. Statistics show that the average daily homework time for Chinese primary and secondary school students is 180 minutes, while in Japan it is less than 80 minutes. Chinese primary and secondary school students have only 130 minutes of physical exercise per week, while Japanese students have 408.5 minutes. This approach, which ignores the physiological and psychological development of young people, is essentially a form of abuse. The physical education work in primary and secondary schools determines the future physical quality of our nation. Only high intelligence built on a strong physique is sustainable. Otherwise, history will mercilessly repeat the tragedies of Luo Jianhua and Jiang Zuying.

　　顾此失彼——中小学体育问题透视（上）
    近期的一项中日青少年体质综合调查表明，我国青少年各年龄组身高的平均值均高于日本青少年，但在身体发育壮实程度的指标上，我国青少年大都低于日本，其中体重男性低零点九至三点八公斤，女性低零点一至三点八公斤。这些“豆芽菜”型青少年胸廓小，心肺功能差，视力不良，脊柱侧弯、神经衰弱等发病率不断上升。
    与日本青少年对比，我国各年龄组男女青少年的反映肌肉力量的背肌力平均低三点五至二十五点一公斤，反映耐力的五分钟跑平均低二十六至一百一十九米。我国青少年的体质状况和运动能力远远地落后于世界发达国家水平，并有进一步拉大距离的趋势。
    当然，这绝非是孩子们本身造成的。人们虽然意识到狂热追求升学率的弊害，并不停地呼吁停止这种危险的“升级”行为。但是在实际工作中，衡量学校、校长和教师的成绩，仍旧是以巩固率、及格率、流失率、入学率为标准，并与奖金挂钩。校长、教师和家长齐心协力，把学生“关”在室内。经不住风雨，见不了阳光，跑不了几步就气喘吁吁，这就是孩子们为提高学业成绩付出的代价。
    在北京市西城区的一次座谈会上，一些体育教师指陈目前我国部分中小学校长对体育的模糊认识。不少校长一手抓升学率，一手抓校办企业的利润率。体育教师无能为力，只能任由其他课任教师随意支配分割学生的体育锻炼时间。白天七节课和大量的家庭作业，迫使孩子整日埋头书本。据统计，我国中小学生日均家庭作业时间为一百八十分钟，而日本还不到八十分钟；我国中小学生每周体育锻炼时间只有一百三十分钟，日本则有四百零八点五分钟。这种不顾青少年生理与心理发育特点的做法实际上是一种摧残行为。中小学体育工作决定着我们民族未来的身体素质。只有构筑在高体质上的高智力才是可偿的。否则，历史将毫不留情地重演罗健夫、蒋筑英的悲剧。  　　林述安　卞文阳
