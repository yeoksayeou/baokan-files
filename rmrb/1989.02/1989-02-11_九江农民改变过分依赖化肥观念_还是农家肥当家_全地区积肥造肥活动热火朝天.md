Farmers in Jiujiang, Jiangxi, have realized that long-term use of chemical fertilizers has led to the phenomenon of "spending money but making the land poorer." They have now prioritized the accumulation of farmyard manure. Since last winter, the entire region has launched a campaign to collect and produce manure, with 600,000 laborers participating. By the end of January, they had dug up 13 million cubic meters of pond mud and collected over 10 million loads of soil mixed fertilizer and animal manure. This is the best year for collecting farmyard manure in recent years.

It is understood that in Jiujiang City, the ratio of farmyard manure to chemical fertilizer usage has changed from 8:2 in the 1950s to 4:6 in the 1980s. As a result, the soil has become compacted and the topsoil has thinned. The working layer, which was previously 20 centimeters thick, has now reduced to 13-15 centimeters. Due to these changes in soil structure and quality, the land's ability to resist drought, flooding, retain water, and retain nutrients has significantly decreased, leading to a reduction in the crops' resistance to adverse conditions.

　　九江农民改变过分依赖化肥观念    
    还是农家肥当家     
    全地区积肥造肥活动热火朝天
    本报南昌２月１０日电  据《江西日报》报道：江西九江地区农民看到由于长期使用化肥，出现“花了钱瘦了田”现象，已把积农家肥摆上了头等位置。去冬以来，全地区开展了积肥造肥活动，参加的劳力达到６０万人，至元月底止，已挑塘泥１３０余万立方米，积土杂肥、栏粪等１００余万担，这是近些年来积农家肥最好的一年。
    据了解，九江市使用农家肥与化肥的比例，由５０年代的８∶２变成８０年代的４∶６，结果土壤变板结了，上层变浅了，过去工作层厚达２０厘米，现在已降至１３—１５厘米以下。由于土层土质变化，耕地抗旱、抗涝、保水、保肥能力明显降低，导致农作物抗逆性能减弱。
