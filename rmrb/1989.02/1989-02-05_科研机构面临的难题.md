Challenges Faced by Research Institutions

1. Lack of emphasis on basic or theoretical research. Some colleagues in research institutions are eager to work on short-term, quick-impact projects and provide technical guidance to township enterprises. However, when it comes to more long-term or challenging projects, they tend to pass the buck, especially in the areas of basic or theoretical research. The former involves general technology, even technology that people have been able to handle for decades, while the latter involves relatively new technology or technology that no one has yet developed.

2. Difficulty in publishing scientific papers and monographs. Many researchers have reported that after years of hard work and numerous revisions, their papers and monographs, although highly praised by domestic peers and even internationally, are often rejected by publishers. The reason given is that the print run is small, the price is high, and there are few buyers.

3. Difficulty in retaining graduate students. A certain research institute has more openings for graduate students than the number of applicants. However, several existing graduate students did not complete their studies and have gone their separate ways—some to companies, others abroad.

### 科研机构面临的难题

　　科研机构面临的难题
    一、不重视基础或理论研究工作。有些科研机构的同志都抢着去干短平快的课题和去乡镇企业进行技术指导，而对一些比较长远或难度较大的课题，却互相推诿，尤其是基础或理论研究方面的工作。前者属一般性技术，甚至是几十年前人们就能够干的技术，后者却是比较新的技术或目前还没有人搞出来的技术。
    二、科技论文和专著很难出版。不少科研人员反映，他们经过多年的艰苦努力，经过多少次修改出来的论文和专著，虽然有的受到国内同行的高度评价，甚至得到国际同行的赞扬，可是出版社却婉言拒绝，原因是印数少，价格高，购买的人不多。
    三、研究生留不住。某研究所招收研究生的名额比前来报考的人数还要多，原有的几位研究生没有读完就分化了，有的去了公司，有的去了国外。
