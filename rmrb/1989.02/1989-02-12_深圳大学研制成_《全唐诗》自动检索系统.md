Shenzhen University Develops Automatic Retrieval System for "Complete Tang Poetry"

	Reported by our newspaper: The automatic retrieval system for "Complete Tang Poetry" developed by the Shenzhen University Classical Literature Computer Software Research Group was completed in December 1988.

	The system began development in January 1987 and successfully underwent initial trials in August of the same year. The research group later conducted a comprehensive revision and organization of the system. Associate Professors Zhong Jialing and Qian Xuelie from the Chinese Department, and Lecturer Zhou Jingzhou from the Electronics Department participated in this work.

	The "Complete Tang Poetry" automatic retrieval system stores all 900 volumes, 3310,000 characters, and 48,900 poems by over 2,200 authors from the Tang Dynasty spanning 300 years. Experts believe that the establishment of this automatic retrieval system is of great significance for the study of Tang poetry and Tang Dynasty Chinese language.

	After completing the "Complete Tang Poetry" automatic retrieval system, some teachers and students from the Chinese Department and the Electronics Department of Shenzhen University began working on the development of a "Full Chinese Character Operating System" and plan to establish a database called the "Great Encyclopedia of China" supported by this system.

　　深圳大学研制成
    《全唐诗》自动检索系统
    本报讯  由深圳大学古典名著电脑软件研制组研制的《全唐诗》自动检索系统，于１９８８年１２月完成。
    该系统１９８７年１月开始研制，同年８月初步试验成功。研制组后来又对该系统作了全面修正和整理。深圳大学中文系副教授钟嘉陵、钱学烈，电子系讲师周景洲等参加了这项工作。
    《全唐诗》自动检索系统把《全唐诗》收录的唐代３００年间２２００多位作者的４８９００首诗歌共９００卷、３３１万多字都储存起来。专家们认为，这种自动检索系统的建立，对唐代诗歌的研究和唐代汉语的研究有重大意义。
    在完成《全唐诗》自动检索系统后，深圳大学中文系和电子系的一些师生又着手研制“全汉字操作系统”，并准备建立此系统支持下的数据库《中华大典》。
