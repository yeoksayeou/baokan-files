I first saw the *Family Daily*. The editor-in-chief is the son Liu Jie, 9 years old. The layout designer is the father Liu Yongtao. The front page headline is Liu Jie's *I Want to Say...*, and the lower half of the page features a letter from *Mom's Letter from a Business Trip*. The eye-catcher is *To the Readers*. The second page is *Make Your Own Toys*, along with excerpts from Liu Jie's diary. There is a *Little Paradise* column, featuring *A Conversation with Dad*. Liu Jie asks, "Dad, what does 'perseverance' mean?" Dad replies, "It means to persist in doing something without giving up halfway. For example, you learn to play the accordion, but when you're busy, you stop practicing. That's not perseverance."

The family newspaper is produced by the teachers of the Chaoyang District Family Education School, along with students and parents from Class 3 of Xinyuan Xili Primary School.

Since its establishment over a year ago, the school has enrolled 4,529 students from 10 primary schools and 31 middle schools, with 588 graduates. Simultaneously, it has trained 130 class advisors for 68 middle schools.

The people behind this endeavor are six retired Communist Party members, with an average age of 57.5 years. They are: Liu Ming, former deputy district head and vice chairman of the Standing Committee of the People's Congress of Chaoyang District, now serving as the principal of the Family Education School; Li Xiuzhen, former principal of Bailizhuang Middle School, now serving as the vice principal of the Family Education School; former party branch secretary of Xinyuanli No. 2 Middle School Gao Baozhen, former vice principal of Sanlitun No. 1 Middle School Zhang Xinmin, former party branch secretary of Guanhuang No. 2 Middle School An Yuying, and former educational director of Bailizhuang School District Meng Lizhen, now serving as teachers and staff of the school.

"We old folks, with the same aspirations, came together to contribute to the educational cause of Chaoyang District in our remaining years," said 63-year-old Liu Ming, leading the team to start the school. It was a time when people were busy with business and making money. These six old educators, who have dedicated their lives to education, were not swayed by money. They gathered together, running around everywhere. They secured 1,000 yuan in educational funds from the municipal education bureau, borrowed a 12-square-meter office from the Third Middle School in Tuanjie Lake, and managed to gather four stools, four chairs, one cabinet, and one tape recorder.

Liu Ming fell ill and was hospitalized. She was concerned about inviting 16 teachers to give lectures, so she called Vice Principal Li Xiuzhen to her bedside to discuss the matter. This old teacher, who had worked in education for 40 years, was moved and said, "Comrade District Head, don't worry, I'll take care of it." She had just retired, and someone offered her a high salary to run a college entrance exam class, but she declined. Her daughter-in-law had a baby, and she was asked to stay home to take care of the grandchild, but she refused, choosing instead to spend 50 yuan a month to send the baby to her in-laws. Li Xiuzhen gained her "freedom," commuting two and a half hours each way by bus every day to work on the school.

Gao Baozhen had just attended a retirement celebration when she joined the welcoming meeting hosted by Liu Ming. Gao Baozhen said, "Working with you, though it's hard work, I'm willing to do what I love."

58-year-old Zhang Xinmin is in charge of finances and also manages the teaching organization for 14 middle schools and 1,300 students in the Tuanjie Lake area. Every time a teacher gives a lecture, he rides his bicycle carrying a tape recorder, a thermos, and a cup of tea to serve. In the winter, even when it snows heavily and the roads are slippery, he never stops. 55-year-old Meng Lizhen said, "I'm the youngest here. My biggest impression is that the older sisters and brothers are full of energy. We have no money, no power, just a warm heart!"

　　全凭热心肠——记北京朝阳区办家教学校的几位老人
    本报记者  段存章
    我第一次看到《家庭日报》。总编辑：儿子刘杰，９岁。刊头设计者：父亲刘永涛。头版头条刊登刘杰写的《我想说……》，下半版登载出差在外的《妈妈来信》，报眼是《致读者》。二版是《自己动手做玩具》，还有刘杰的日记摘抄。有个《小乐园》专栏，登的是《和爸爸的一次对话》。刘杰问：“爸爸，持之以恒是什么意思？”爸爸答：“就是无论做什么事情都要坚持不懈，不能半途而废。比如，你学拉风琴，一忙就不练了。这就不叫持之以恒。”
    家庭报纸是北京市朝阳区家教学校的老师们辅导新源西里小学三班学生、家长共同办的。
    这所家教学校创办一年多来，吸收１０所小学、３１所中学的学员４５２９人，已有５８８人结业。同时，为６８所中学培训班主任１３０名。
    干这番事业的是离退休的６位共产党员，平均年龄５７岁半。他们是：刘铭，原朝阳区副区长、人大常委会副主任，现任家教学校校长；李秀珍，原八里庄中学校长，现任家教学校副校长；原新源里二中党支部书记高宝珍、原三里屯一中副校长张新民、原管庄二中党支部书记安郁英、原八里庄学区教导主任孟丽珍，现分别担任该校教师和工作人员。
    “我们这些老头、老太志同道合走到一起来，都想在有生之年为朝阳区教育事业做点贡献。”６３岁的刘铭带领大家开始办校，正是社会上人们经商、挣钱热的时候。毕生热爱教育事业的这六位老人，没有被金钱迷住，聚在一起，四处奔走。他们求得市教育局拨给办学经费１０００元，从团结湖三中借下一间１２平方米的办公室，还七拼八凑搬来四条凳、四把椅、一个柜子、一台录音机。
    刘铭忙病了，住进医院。她惦记着请１６位老师讲课的事，就打电话把副校长李秀珍叫到病床前商量。这位在教育岗位工作４０个春秋的老教师被感动了，她说：“老区长，你放心，事由我来办。”她刚退下来，有人给高工资聘她去办高考班，她不干；儿媳妇生了娃，让她在家抱孙子，她不肯，宁愿每月自己出５０元钱，把娃娃送到亲家。李秀珍获得了“解放”，每天上下班挤两个半小时的公共汽车去办学。
    高宝珍刚刚出席过离休欢送会，就参加了刘铭主持的欢迎会。高宝珍说：“跟你干，吃苦受累，可干些我喜欢干的事，心甘情愿。”
    ５８岁的张新民负责财务，兼管团结湖一带１４所中学、１３００名学员的授课组织工作。每次老师讲课，他骑自行车驮着录音机、提着暖壶、拿着清茶去服务。冬天下大雪，路远道滑，从不间断。５５岁的孟丽珍说：“这里数我年龄小，我的最大感受是老大姐、老大哥们精力充沛。我们是一没钱，二没权，全凭热心肠！”
