A United Airlines Boeing 747 aircraft experienced an incident early on the morning of February 24 over the skies near Hawaii. The aircraft's fuselage tore open, prompting the pilots to make an emergency return to Honolulu International Airport, where the plane landed safely, averting a major air disaster. The tear in the front right side of the aircraft extended from the upper part of the fuselage to the bottom of the cargo hold, measuring over 6 meters in length and over 3 meters in width.

A New Zealand passenger seated in the 13th row witnessed the incident. She said she was awakened by a low, grinding noise, followed by a loud bang as a large hole was torn open. Luggage from the overhead compartments vanished, and the seats in rows 8, 9, and 10 disappeared, along with the passengers seated there. Survivors described a chaotic scene inside the cabin, with debris flying and a strong wind blowing. Despite the panic, most passengers remained surprisingly calm, except for one who had a hysterical outburst. The passengers anxiously awaited the sight of Honolulu's lights below.

This incident is the third involving a Boeing 747 in the past two months. Investigators from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, the Federal Aviation Administration, United Airlines, and Boeing Company began their investigation on the same day, ruling out causes such as bomb explosions. Their focus is now on the aircraft's structure and maintenance, although the exact cause remains unclear. The aircraft, produced in November 1970, has flown for 58,800 hours and completed 15,000 takeoffs, making it a "middle-aged" aircraft by these standards. A United Airlines spokesperson stated that the aircraft underwent a four-day comprehensive inspection 88 days prior and another check on February 16.

This incident bears a striking resemblance to an incident involving an Aloha Airlines Boeing 737 in April of the previous year, where the aircraft's fuselage also tore open. Fortunately, neither incident resulted in a major disaster. However, the safety of aging aircraft remains a contentious issue in the U.S. aviation industry, with no suitable solution yet found.

	2月24日，美国联合航空公司一架波音747客机在机身发生爆炸出现一个大洞后，安全飞回夏威夷檀香山机场。这架飞机是在飞往新西兰的奥克兰途中出事的。据报道，至少有11人失踪，17人受伤。

　　美失事客机机龄十九岁：尚属“壮年”
    十个月中发生两次事故：惊人相似
    本报华盛顿２月２４日电  记者张启昕报道：２月２４日凌晨，一架美国联合航空公司的７４７客机，在夏威夷附近上空发生事故，机身外壳撕裂，驾驶员紧急返航，客机安全着落在檀香山国际机场，避免了一场大空难。事故中，客机前右侧被撕开的裂口从机身上部一直到货舱底部，长６米多，宽３米多。
    一位坐在第１３排的新西兰旅客目击事故的发生。她说，她被一种低沉的嘎嘎作响声惊醒，接着就是砰地一响，裂开一个大口。行李架上的东西全都不翼而飞，第８、９、１０排的座椅不见了，坐在那里的旅客也失踪了。生还的旅客说，当时机舱里感到狂风乱作，杂物碎片飞舞。人们在惊慌中，不知何故十分平静，只有一位旅客歇斯底里发作。人们在焦急地盼望，等待见到檀香山地面的灯光。
    这次事故是近两个月来波音７４７客机发生的第三次事故，美国运输安全委员会、联邦航空局、联合航空公司和波音公司的调查员当天即开始了事故调查，已经排除炸弹爆炸之类的原因，注意力集中在飞机的结构和保养上，但目前原因尚不清楚。这架客机是１９７０年１１月的产品，已飞行５８８００小时，起飞１５０００次，从这些数据而言，机龄算为“中年”。联合航空公司的发言人称，８８天前，飞机进行过一次４天的全面检查，２月１６日又作过一次检查。
    这次事故同去年４月一架阿罗哈航空公司波音７３７客机机身外壳撕裂有惊人相似之处，所幸的都没有酿成重大灾难，但关于老化客机的安全问题仍是美国航空界争论的热点，至今尚未找到合适的解决办法。
