Wang Xiaohong won the silver medal in the women's 200-meter butterfly with a time of 2 minutes and 13.14 seconds, setting a new national record.

In the men's events, Chinese swimmer Zhan Jiang finished fourth in the 200-meter butterfly, while Chang Qing placed seventh in the 100-meter breaststroke.

Over the three-day competition, the Chinese team won a total of three gold medals, one silver medal, and two bronze medals, breaking three national records.

After the competition, Chinese swimming team coach Gang Guolin said that the results showed foreign athletes had not relaxed their training since the Seoul Olympics. They maintained good performances in this competition. However, some Chinese athletes' performances have declined during this period, which should be a cause for concern.
