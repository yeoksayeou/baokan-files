Theoretical construction first involves the issue of conceptual renewal.

The utilitarianism that emerged during the Cultural Revolution, which emphasized practicality and immediate results, advocating learning whatever is useful and seeing immediate effects, and not valuing theoretical issues, was not something that suddenly appeared overnight. It had historical roots and social causes. We need to engage in more theoretical thinking. The integration of theory with practice is the essence of Marxism. However, we should not interpret the integration of theory with practice in a utilitarian way, believing that only immediate problem-solving is useful. The effectiveness of theory is often not direct or short-term; sometimes it seems unrelated to practice, but as long as it reveals some truth or uncovers some truth, it will ultimately benefit human society. The decisions made by the Party's Eleventh and Twelfth Plenary Sessions of the Third Plenum are both realistic and creative. If we had relied on textbooks for ready-made answers, we would not have been able to formulate these two decisions. I believe that the basic principles of Marxism are also deepened with the development of practice. In a certain sense, socialist commodity economy is also a basic principle. Our current economic work cannot violate it and revert to the previous centralized planned economy. Can this not be said to be a basic principle that must be adhered to in the economic field? From this, we can also see that some basic principles of Marxism are also developing. Therefore, we should not adopt a rigid attitude but a developmental perspective to view the adherence to the Four Cardinal Principles. Sometimes, we think we are adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles, but often we are actually adhering to some established and habitual concepts from the past, without distinguishing which of these established concepts are Marxist and which are non-Marxist, or even anti-Marxist. For example, taking class struggle as the key link, the two "whatevers," big and public, art must serve politics, intellectuals must receive re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants, etc., are not Marxist views but extreme leftist ideologies or traditional concepts reflecting petty-bourgeois consciousness. These things are harmful to the current reforms and the modernization of socialist construction. An important task of theoretical work in the primary stage of socialism is to update concepts in theoretical construction. This requires us to eliminate those things that we have long considered Marxist but are actually non-Marxist from the established concepts.

Here, I would like to propose a personal view for everyone's reference. In my opinion, theoretical research can adopt multiple methods. The first is explanatory, that is, to explain, elaborate, and develop a certain viewpoint on a certain issue. The second is integrative, that is, based on a certain topic, to collect relevant materials, distinguish between true and false, and conduct examinations to clarify the appearance of a certain phenomenon in a certain era or the crux of a certain issue. The third is exploratory, that is, to conduct creative research on areas not previously explored by others, or to conduct breakthrough re-recognition and re-evaluation of conclusions already reached by others. These three research methods are only general. Naturally, theoretical research methods are diverse and can have other methods. I believe that at present, when facing reform and conceptual renewal, we should pay special attention to exploratory theoretical research. In the previous period, the objects of introduction were limited to Western science and technology, while social sciences were considered somewhat sensitive and needed to be demarcated. A few years ago, the academic community proposed the issue of the tertiary industry, which is different from the division of the two major departments in "Capital," so some scholars in the academic community came out to oppose it. The concept of technological revolution is also not acceptable, saying it is bourgeois. We have a bad old tradition, that is, to treat Marxism in the way of commentaries on classics, not allowing a single word to be changed, emphasizing lineage. Commentaries on classics require adherence to the teacher's words, and if the commentary does not conform to the teacher's words, it is not used. This was particularly evident in the Han Dynasty. Scholars in the Song Dynasty began to develop a spirit of doubt, and by the Qing Dynasty, this spirit of doubt had been greatly developed. We often criticize Qing Dynasty evidential scholarship as pedantic, but the spirit of doubt in Qing Dynasty evidential scholarship made the sacred halo over the classics fade. For example, Dai Zhen said that without conclusive evidence, even the words of fathers and teachers should not be believed. Such figures like Dai Zhen in history are rare. Now the times have changed, but in the new situation, this spirit of commentary on classics and dogmatism is not dispelled. The combination of old dogmatism in history and new dogmatism now is a very frightening thing. We are not only backward in economics but also in culture, which is the soil for the growth of dogmatism.

Since the founding of the nation, we have rarely mentioned the law of negation of negation. It is said that before the Cultural Revolution, at the Hangzhou Conference, Mao Zedong thought that the law of negation of negation could not be established. He thought that there were some examples in life that were difficult to explain with the law of negation of negation. For example, the feudal society negated the slave society, and the capitalist society negated the feudal society, but the capitalism's negation of feudalism was not a negation of negation, but rather an affirmation. Therefore, there is no phenomenon of the low-level form returning in the high-level form. This is indeed a fact, but some laws are only effective in a broader time and space domain. Engels once said: "The further we move away from the economic field and approach the purely abstract field of thought, the more accidental we see in its development, and the more its curve becomes tortuous. If you draw the central line of the curve, you will find that the longer the period of study and the broader the scope of study, the closer this axis will be to the axis of economic development, and the more it will proceed in parallel with it." This passage originally referred to the role of the economic base in social development, but it can equally explain the law of negation of negation. If we look at it from a longer time and a broader domain, the negation of private ownership by the original communist society and the negation of the private ownership society by the communist society constitute the law of negation of negation of affirmation—negation—synthesis. Not recognizing this law will make the process of cultural development appear as a simplified linear process, and it will also produce more serious consequences. The so-called thorough break during the Cultural Revolution, which completely rejected the past culture as "feudal, bourgeois, and revisionist" and destroyed it, is inseparable from the long-term failure to mention the law of negation of negation and the distortion of scientific critical spirit. Marxism's critical spirit is not a simple all-out negation, but has the meaning of sublation.

In the past, we often talked about the whole history of philosophy being the history of the struggle between the two lines of materialism and idealism. This point was not mentioned by Marx and Engels, but was proposed by Lenin in "Materialism and Empirio-Criticism." At that time, he mainly wanted to refute the political views of Bogdanov and others and introduce party-line ideas into philosophy. If it is said that the entire history of philosophy must be divided by materialism and idealism, it will inevitably lead to the conclusion that from ancient times to the present, all materialism is progressive, and all idealism is backward or reactionary. But the entire history of philosophy cannot be explained by this formula. Lenin said that Marxism has three sources, one of which is German classical philosophy. As representatives of German classical philosophy, Kant, Fichte, Schelling, Hegel, etc., are all idealists, and Feuerbach is only a half-materialist, and his philosophy is also idealist in the upper half. At that time, materialism, as Engels said, was declining. Can it be said that these materialists like Bloch, Vogt, and Freiligrath were more brilliant and progressive than Kant, Fichte, and Hegel? Why is one of the three sources of Marxism the latter rather than the former? Or should we stand on the side of the former to oppose the latter? In the past, theoretical research, in order to forcibly incorporate all phenomena in the ideological field into the model of the struggle between the two lines of materialism and idealism, made various forced judgments. In order to affirm the value of a certain historical figure, even if it was originally idealist, it was also said to be materialist.

There are many idealist things in history. Should we all put them in the error exhibition hall? In the past, we thought that all idealist things were worthless and could only be discarded and not absorbed. Marx and Engels only absorbed Hegel's dialectics from Hegel, and it was the dialectics with the head and feet reversed that was absorbed. This view has long been a fixed axiom and seems undeniable. But in fact, Marx and Engels also absorbed idealist things from German classical philosophy. An obvious example is that Marx said in "Theses on Feuerbach" that, contrary to materialism, the active aspect was developed by idealism. Marx absorbed the subjective initiative of man from Hegel, and naturally, in the process of absorption, he experienced criticism and dissolution, turning abstract initiative into real sensory activity. In "Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844," Marx also praised Hegel's view of "naturalized man." These do not belong to the dialectical part of Hegel but to his idealist part. If all idealist things are regarded as worthless dregs, then there are very few things that can be affirmed in the history of thought.

I think Lenin's theory itself is also developing, and his early philosophical thoughts and late philosophical thoughts are not immutable. We should absorb the more mature and complete theories from it, and cannot use the "whatever" view to quote it as a classic that cannot be changed by a single word. After Lenin read a large number of philosophical works, especially Hegel's philosophy, in his later years, he proposed views different from before. He said: "Intelligent idealism is closer to intelligent materialism than stupid materialism." This is different from the previous view of dividing by materialism and idealism.

In the past, the theoretical community's understanding of contradictions was influenced by the Soviet Union's criticism of Deborin, believing that differences are contradictions, which is a split into two, and thus produced a philosophy of struggle, so during the Great Leap Forward, slogans like "conquer the earth" and "declare war on the earth" were proposed. In fact, the relationship between man and nature is not one of conquest. Man should regard himself as a part of nature and seek a relationship of mutual adaptation. With a utilitarian attitude, blindly exploiting natural resources will destroy the ecological balance, and the above-mentioned philosophy of struggle is also wrong when applied to nature. As for its application to human society, when it develops to the extreme, to the point of the Cultural Revolution, where it is used everywhere, applied to the vast majority of people and comrades, the consequences are even more serious, and the destructive power is even greater. In fact, the world is a unity of diversity. Diversity does not necessarily constitute a contradiction but can be harmonious and a unity of diversity. Our ancients had the saying that a single sound does not make a voice, and a single color does not make a pattern, which is called harmony but difference. The ownership forms of a socialist country are also diverse, including socialist public ownership, collective ownership, individual economy, and state capitalism, and are not a single economy. We should recognize the multi-layered and rich nature of social structure in this way, and only then can we make scientific generalizations about objective reality. With the development of practice and scientific progress, concepts need to be renewed, and Marxism also needs to develop, so as to maintain its vigorous vitality.

　　理论建设与观念更新
　　王元化
    理论建设首先有一个观念更新的问题。
    “文革”中呈现出来的实用主义，急功近利，提倡做什么学什么，立竿见影，不重视理论问题的倾向，不是一朝一夕或忽然发生的，而是有它的历史根源和社会原因的。我们需要多做一点理论思考。理论结合实际是马克思主义的精髓。但是，我们不能把理论联系实际作实用主义的理解，以为只有立竿见影地解决问题才是有用的。理论的功效往往不是直接的短期的，有时看起来似乎与实际无关，然而只要是某种真象的揭示或真理的发掘，就终将会造福于人类社会。党的十一届及十二届三中全会的决定是实事求是的，又是富有创造精神的。倘从书本去找现成答案就制定不出这两个决定。我认为马克思主义的基本原理也是随着实践发展而不断深化的。社会主义商品经济就某种意义来说也是一项基本原理，我们现在的经济工作都不能违背它，退回到过去那种集中的计划经济上去。这难道还不能说是在经济领域中必须坚持的基本原则么？从这儿也可以看出马克思主义的一些基本原则也是在发展着的。这样我们就不能用僵化的态度而要用发展观点去看待坚持四项基本原则。我们有时候自以为是在坚持四项基本原则，其实往往是在坚持过去所通行所习惯的一些既定观念，而并没有去分辨过去哪些既定观念是马克思主义的，哪些是被附加的非马克思主义的，甚至是和马克思主义背道而驰的。例如以阶级斗争为纲，两个凡是，一大二公，文艺必须为政治服务，知识分子必须接受贫下中农的再教育等等，都不是马克思主义观点而是一种极左思潮或反映小农意识的传统观念。这些东西对于当前的改革以及社会主义现代化建设是有害的。社会主义初级阶段理论工作的一项重要任务，就是在理论建设上进行观念更新。这就需要清除那些既定观念中我们长期认为是马克思主义而实际上却是非马克思主义的东西。
    这里，我想提出一点自己的看法，供大家参考。照我看来，理论研究可以采取多种方式。第一种是阐释性的，即对某一问题的某种观点加以说明、引申和发挥。第二种是整理性的，即根据某一课题，搜集有关资料，辨别真伪，进行考辨，以阐明某时代某一现象的面貌或某一问题的症结所在。第三种是探索性的，即对前人所未涉及的领域进行创造性的研讨，或对前人已有的结论进行突破性的再认识和再评价。这三种研究方式，只是就大体而言。自然，理论研究方式是多样的，还可以有其它方式。我认为，目前在面临改革、观念更新的时候，特别要注意探索性的理论研究。前一时期，我们所说的引进对象仅限于西方的科学技术，而对社会科学则觉得有些烫手，需要划清界限。前些年，理论界提出了第三产业问题，这不同于《资本论》中两大部类的划分，于是学术界就有人出来反对。技术革命的提法也不行，说是资产阶级的。我们有一种不好的老传统，这就是以经生注经方式去对待马克思主义，一字不许出入，讲究师承。经生注经须墨守师说，疏不破注，背师说即不用。这在两汉特别显著。宋代学者开始萌发了怀疑精神，至清代这种怀疑精神则发扬光大。我们往往把清人的考据学斥为繁琐，但清人考据学中的怀疑精神使笼罩在经典上的神圣光圈变得黯然失色了。例如戴震就说过，倘无确凿证据，虽父师之言不信。像戴震这样的人物在历史上是凤毛麟角。现在时代变了，可是在新的情况下，这种经生注经的教条主义阴魂不散。历史上老的教条主义和现在新的教条主义结合起来是非常可怕的东西。我们不仅在经济上落后，在文化上也同样落后，这是教条主义滋长的土壤。
    建国以来，我们很少提到否定之否定规律。据说“文革”前在杭州会议上，毛泽东曾认为否定之否定规律不能成立。他认为生活中有些例子很难用否定之否定规律去说明。比如封建社会否定奴隶社会后，资本主义社会又否定封建社会，而资本对封建否定奴隶并不是否定之否定，相反，倒是肯定的。因此这里面就没有低级形态在高级形态的复归现象。这固然是事实，但是有些规律只是在更宽广的时空领域内才有效准。恩格斯曾经说：“我们所研究的领域愈是远离经济领域，愈是接近于纯粹抽象的思想领域，我们在它的发展中看到的偶然性就愈多，它的曲线就愈是曲折。如果您划出曲线的中轴线，您就会发觉，研究的时期愈长，研究的范围愈广，这个轴线就愈接近经济发展的轴线，就愈是跟后者平行而进。”这段话原是指社会发展中经济基础的作用，但正可以同样说明否定之否定规律。如果从更长的时间和更广的领域来看，私有制否定原始共产社会后，共产主义社会又否定私有制社会，这就构成了正——反——合否定之否定的发展规律。不承认这一规律就会把文化发展的曲线进程看作简单化的直线进程，并且还会产生更严重的恶果。“文化大革命”中出现的所谓彻底决裂，把过去文化一概斥为“封资修”加以消灭，是和长期以来不讲否定之否定规律，歪曲科学的批判精神分不开的。马克思主义的批判精神不是简单地全盘否定，而是具有扬弃的含义。
    过去我们常常谈到整部哲学史就是唯物主义和唯心主义两条路线的斗争史。这一点马克思恩格斯并没有提到过，而是列宁在《唯物主义与经验批判主义》中提出来的。当时他主要是要反对波格丹诺夫等人的政治观点，而把党派性观念引入哲学。倘使说整个哲学史都必须以唯物唯心来划线，就势必会引出这样一个结论，从古到今凡唯物主义都是进步的，唯心主义都是落后的或反动的。但整个哲学史却无法用这种公式去说明。列宁说马克思主义有三个来源，其中之一就是德国古典哲学。作为德国古典哲学的代表人物康德、费希特、谢林、黑格尔等都是唯心主义者，费尔巴哈也只是半截唯物主义者，他的哲学上半截也是唯心主义的。当时的唯物主义，用恩格斯的话来说，已是江河日下。难道能够说当时的布洛赫、伏格特、弗莱肖特等这些唯物主义者比康德、费希特、黑格尔等更高明更进步么？马克思主义的三个来源之一为什么是后者而不是前者呢？或者，难道我们应当站在前者一边去反对后者么？过去我们理论研究为了把思想领域中的一切现象强行纳入唯物唯心两条路线斗争的模式，以致作出种种削足适履的论断，为了肯定某一历史人物的价值，就把本来是唯心的，也说成是唯物的了。
    历史上唯心主义的东西很多，是不是都要放进错误陈列馆去呢？过去我们认为凡属唯心主义的东西，都毫无价值，只能摈弃，不能吸取，马恩从黑格尔那里只是吸收了他的辩证法，而且是把头脚倒置的辩证法顺转过来才吸取的。这种观点长期以来已成既定公理，似乎不容置疑。但事实上马恩也从德国古典哲学中吸取了唯心主义的东西。明显的例子就是马克思在《关于费尔巴哈的提纲》中说过的，跟唯物主义相反，能动的方面却被唯心主义发展了。马克思是从黑格尔那里吸取了人的主观能动性的，自然在吸取过程中经过了批判和消融，把抽象的能动性变为现实的感性的活动。马克思在《１８４４年经济学哲学手稿》中也称赞了黑格尔的“人化了的自然”观点。这些都不属于黑格尔的辩证法部分而属于他的唯心主义部分。如果把所有唯心主义的东西都当作毫无可取的糟粕，那么思想史上可以肯定的东西也太少了。
    我认为列宁的学说本身也是在发展的，他的早期哲学思想和晚期哲学思想并非一成不变。我们应当吸收其中更成熟更完整的理论，而不能用凡是观点，一律当作一字不可出入的经典加以征引。列宁在后期读了大量哲学著作特别是黑格尔哲学以后，就提出过不同于以前的看法。他说：“聪明的唯心主义比愚蠢的唯物主义是更接近聪明的唯物主义的”。这也就不同于以前那种以唯物唯心去划线的看法了。
    过去理论界对矛盾的理解受到苏联批判德波林的影响，认为差异就是矛盾，就是一分为二，而这样就产生了“与天奋斗，其乐无穷；与地奋斗，其乐无穷；与人奋斗，其乐无穷”的斗争哲学，所以大跃进时就提出了“征服地球”和“向地球开战”之类豪言壮语。其实人与自然的关系不是征服关系，人应把自己看作是自然本身的一分子，寻求相互适应的关系。以功利主义的态度盲目索取自然资源，将会破坏生态平衡，上述的那种斗争哲学用在自然上也是错误的。至于用于人类社会，发展到极端，以致像“文化大革命”那样，到处滥用，施之于广大人民和自己同志，那后果就更严重，破坏性就更大了。其实世界是多样统一的。多样性不一定都构成矛盾，也可以是和谐的、多样统一的。我们古代有单音不成声，单色不成文的说法，这就叫作和而不同。社会主义国家的所有制形式也是多样性的，有社会主义全民所有制、集体所有制，还有个体经济，以及国家资本主义等形式，不是单一经济。我们要这样地认识社会结构的多层性和丰富性，才可能对客观实际作出科学的概括。随着实践发展和科学进步，观念要更新，马克思主义也要发展，这样才能保持旺盛的生命力。
