	Welcoming the Tomorrow of Independent Creation

	“If the skin is gone, where will the hair attach itself?” is a saying by a great man: comparing intellectuals to “hair,” and a certain class to “skin,” is a clever metaphor.

	Chinese intellectuals have indeed always played the role of “hair.” Confucius wanted to “practice the great way,” but could only rely on powerful families. If he encountered someone who didn’t appreciate him, he would be as anxious as a homeless dog; Qu Yuan wanted to display his talents, but could only be loyal to the king. Unfortunately, the king didn’t trust him, so he could only sing “Li Sao” and go to the river. In the feudal era, the only way for Chinese intellectuals to succeed was to become officials. If they didn’t attach themselves to “skin,” the survival of “hair” might be in danger.

	In modern times, the situation changed somewhat. Intellectuals who didn’t become officials could teach or conduct scientific research, but due to the weakness of private capital, schools and research institutes were mainly government-run. Therefore, from an overall perspective, “hair” was still attached to “skin,” but this “skin” was more like “officialdom” than a certain class.

	After entering the socialist era, the metaphor of “hair” and “skin” had to change again. Because intellectuals had already become part of the working class, if “skin” refers to a certain class, then intellectuals should be part of the “skin.” However, analyzing the situation of intellectuals, it is clear that they are attached to some kind of “skin.” For example, once a person graduates, they belong to a certain unit for life. Their career, life, honor, and everything else are within a walled area. The relationship between intellectuals and their “home unit” can also be said to be another kind of “hair” and “skin” relationship.

	Behind this system of “unit ownership of talent” is the vast machine of the product economy. It requires the talents working for it to be uniform and absolutely obedient to a single will. Under this system, it is undeniable that many achievements have been created, but the old system has constrained the creativity of intellectuals, delayed the development of the country’s economy and democracy; at the same time, it has also created a dependent personality in many intellectuals, becoming a difficult problem in today’s reform.

	“Hair” attached to “skin,” relying on “skin” to provide all nutrition. Why is it so difficult to give intellectuals a salary? Why can we only complain in the face of the “inverted brain-body income”? This is probably related to the fact that in the product economy system, the entire income of intellectuals comes from the state salary.

	Now we are building a socialist commodity economy. The commodity economy emphasizes equivalent exchange through the market, and the labor of intellectuals can truly become socialized. It is no longer fixedly subordinate to a certain unit, no longer solely dependent on state salaries, but can be chosen by various parties in society, and can find its place in a multi-economy with public ownership as the mainstay. Once this reform is completed, Chinese intellectuals will appear in a completely new form. They will no longer be “hair” attached to any “skin,” but an independent social group. Intellectuals in the reform tide should at least see their direction: bidding farewell to the dependent past, welcoming the tomorrow of independent creation.

	Editor’s Note: In the era of reform, hot topics change frequently, but the “intellectual problem” seems to be a perennial hot topic. “Knowledge Community Cross-Talk” discusses everything that the knowledge community cares about and is related to the knowledge community. Each article is about 800 words. As for whether it can talk about something meaningful, that depends on friends from all walks of life.

### 迎接独立创造的明天

　　迎接独立创造的明天
    四维
    “皮之不存，毛将焉附”，是一位伟人的名言：把知识分子比作“毛”，把某个阶级比作“皮”，不失为一种机智的比喻。
    中国的知识分子的确历来扮演着“毛”的角色。孔子要想“行大道”，只能附豪门，一遇人家不赏脸，便惶惶如丧家之犬；屈原意欲展抱负，唯有忠君王，偏偏君王不信任，只好吟着《离骚》去投江。在封建时代，中国知识分子的出息只有做官一途，倘不去附在“皮”上，“毛”的生存恐怕都会发生危机。
    到了近代，这情形稍有变化。知识分子不做官，可以去教书，可以去研究科学，但由于民间资本微弱，学校和研究所主要还是官办的。所以从总体上看，“毛”还是附在“皮”上，不过这张“皮”，与其说是某个阶级，不如说是“官方”。
    进入社会主义以后，“毛”与“皮”比喻的指代更得有所变化了。因为知识分子已经是工人阶级的一部分，如果“皮”是指某个阶级的话，那么知识分子就该是“皮”的一部分了。然而分析一下知识分子的状况，又分明附在某种“皮”上。譬如一个人一出校门，就终身属于某个单位，他的事业，他的生活，他的荣辱，他的一切，都在一个围墙里。知识分子同“本单位”的关系也可说是另一种“毛”与“皮”的关系。
    这种人才“单位所有制”的背后，是产品经济的庞大机器。它要求为它工作的人才整齐划一，绝对服从一个意志。在这种体制下，不可否认创造了许多成就，但旧体制束缚了知识分子的创造性，延缓了整个国家经济与民主的发展进程；同时还造成了许多知识分子的依赖性格，成为今天改革中的一个难题。
    “毛”附在“皮”上，依靠“皮”供给全部营养。为什么给知识分子长工资这么难？为什么在“体脑收入倒挂”面前只能发发牢骚？这恐怕与产品经济体制下知识分子的全部收入是靠国家发给工资有关。
    现在我们正在建设社会主义商品经济。商品经济讲究通过市场等价交换，知识分子的劳动就有可能真正走向社会化。它不再固定地从属于某个单位，不再单一地依靠国家工资，而是可供社会各方选择，可以在以公有制为主体的多元经济中寻找自己的用武之地。一旦这项改革完成，中国知识分子将以全新的面貌出现。他们不再是附在任何“皮”上的“毛”，而是独立的社会群体。改革大潮中的知识分子，至少该看清自己的走向：告别依赖被动的过去，迎接独立创造的明天。
    编者寄语：改革时代，热点多变，但“知识分子问题”似乎是不变的热门话题。“知识界纵横谈”，凡知识界关心的，与知识界有关的，皆可纵论横议，每篇８００字左右。至于能不能谈出点名堂，那可要寄望于各界朋友了。
