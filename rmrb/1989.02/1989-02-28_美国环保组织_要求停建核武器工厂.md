U.S. environmental, anti-nuclear, and arms control advocacy groups recently announced plans to jointly urge the U.S. government to halt or suspend the construction of new nuclear weapons factories. They also demand that the government negotiate with the Soviet Union to establish a treaty to jointly limit the production of plutonium, highly enriched uranium, and tritium, the key materials for nuclear weapons. They believe that limiting the production of nuclear materials can significantly reduce the number of nuclear weapons, thereby halting the arms race.

According to reports, the U.S. Department of Energy plans to spend $52 billion over the next 20 years to increase the production of nuclear materials. Additionally, it will allocate $29 billion to clean up toxic radioactive waste from existing nuclear weapons factories.

　　美国环保组织
    要求停建核武器工厂
    本报华盛顿２月２６日电  记者张启昕报道：美国环保、反核和主张军控等１２个组织最近计划共同要求美国政府缓建或停建新的核武器工厂，并要求政府同苏联商订一项条约，共同限制生产钚、高浓铀和氚等核武器原料。他们认为，限制生产核武器原料，可以大大减少核武器数量，从而停止军备竞赛。
    据报道，美国能源部计划在今后２０年里耗资５２０亿美元增加生产核武器原料的新设备，另外还将用２９０亿美元清理现有核武器工厂的有毒放射性废料。
