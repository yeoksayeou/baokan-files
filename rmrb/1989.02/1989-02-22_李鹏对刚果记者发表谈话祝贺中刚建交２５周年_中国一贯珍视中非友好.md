Li Peng, in a written interview with a Congolese News Agency reporter on the eve of the 25th anniversary of diplomatic relations between China and Congo, said that over the past 25 years, China and Congo have, on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, helped each other, learned from each other's strengths, and engaged in various forms of economic and technological cooperation, achieving satisfactory results.

Li Peng said that the development of friendly relations between China and Congo is in line with the fundamental interests of the peoples of both countries.

When talking about Sino-African friendship, he said, "The Chinese people have always regarded the African people as friends and brothers who share weal and woe. We have always treasured the friendly cooperative relationship between China and Africa and resolutely oppose any actions that harm Sino-African friendship."

He also pointed out, "China's policy of opening up to the outside world is comprehensive and, of course, includes friendly African countries. Therefore, this does not mean that China has changed its stance towards Africa. We are willing to work with all African countries to ensure that the traditional friendship between China and Africa is passed down from generation to generation and continually flourishes."

Li Peng expressed that China is a developing country with economic difficulties, but China is willing to make positive contributions to promoting South-South cooperation and the common prosperity of the Third World.

Li Peng pointed out that the more than 20 years of cooperation between China and Congo have accumulated rich experience, laying a solid foundation for further development of cooperation. The fields of cooperation between the two countries are broad, and the prospects for cooperation are very promising.

Li Peng reiterated that China will adhere to the four principles of "equality and mutual benefit, emphasis on practical results, diverse forms, and common development," as well as the policy of "honoring commitments, charging low profits, ensuring quality, and valuing righteousness." Together with Congo, we will strive to explore and open up new paths and methods for cooperation between the two countries.

　　李鹏对刚果记者发表谈话祝贺中刚建交２５周年
    中国一贯珍视中非友好
    据新华社北京２月２１日电  李鹏总理在中国和刚果建交２５周年前夕接受刚果新闻社记者的书面采访时说，２５年来，中、刚两国在平等互利的基础上，互相帮助，取长补短，互通有无，开展了多种形式的经济技术合作，取得了令人满意的成果。
    李鹏说，中、刚两国友好关系的发展是符合两国人民根本利益的。
    在谈到中非友谊时，他说：“中国人民始终把非洲人民看作是同甘共苦的朋友和兄弟。我们一贯珍视中非友好合作关系，坚决反对一切有损于中非友谊的言行。”
    他还指出：“中国实行对外开放政策，是全方位的，当然也包括友好的非洲国家，因而这绝不意味着中国改变了对非洲的立场。我们愿同非洲各国共同努力，让中非传统友谊世代相传，并不断发扬光大。”
    李鹏表示，中国是发展中的国家，经济尚有困难，但中国愿意为促进南南合作与第三世界的共同繁荣作出积极贡献。
    李鹏指出，中刚两国２０多年的合作积累了丰富经验，为今后继续发展合作奠定了坚实的基础，两国的合作领域是宽广的，两国合作的前景是十分美好的。
    李鹏重申，中国将遵循“平等互利、讲求实效、形式多样、共同发展”四项原则以及“守约、薄利、保质、重义”的方针，同刚果一道，努力探索和开拓两国合作的新途径和新方式。
