Today's Paris is a city rich in cultural and artistic facilities: there are ancient royal palaces, grand historical museums, and exhibition halls showcasing the latest technological achievements. Every day, they attract tens of thousands of visitors from home and abroad. However, who would have thought that these enchanting and dazzling places could be used as banquet halls for hosting guests? Tourists can dine and dance in places like the royal palace gardens, surrounded by priceless treasures. Even solemn venues like the Orsay Museum, the Palace of Versailles, and the royal prison are not exempt. The restaurant in the Maritime Museum near the Eiffel Tower can accommodate 1,000 standing guests or 400 seated guests at a time. Every Tuesday, after the museum closes, chefs start preparing meals for visitors at 4 PM. The rental fee ranges from 3,000 to 22,000 francs, depending on the size of the hall, the quality of the facilities, and the duration of the event.

Some tourists prefer to dine in a medieval atmosphere and can do so at the royal prison on the Île Saint-Louis. For 28,000 francs (excluding food costs), thousands of guests can enjoy themselves. It is said that to rent the banquet hall here, one needs to book six months in advance!

Not far from the Louvre, there is a Decorative Arts Museum on the right bank of the Seine River, with two floors available for dining. The nightly rental fee is 15 to 20 francs. This place has been open to visitors and hosting banquets for many years.

The Orangery in the courtyard of the Palace of Versailles is an ideal venue for outdoor banquets. Guests can enjoy a cocktail party with 3,000 attendees against the backdrop of the palace where King Louis XIV once resided, creating a memorable experience. From June to October each year, anyone willing to pay a rental fee of 60,000 francs can host an all-night banquet here. The Orsay Museum, built in the 19th century, opens to tourists for one day each month, with tickets priced at 100,000 francs. During this time, guided tours are available, along with a cocktail reception. The goal is to attract tourism revenue to support the museum's cultural activities.

　　皇家宫苑宴来宾
    钱人惠
    今天的巴黎，文化艺术设施琳琅满目：有古色古香的皇家宫苑，有雄伟壮观的历史博物馆，也有显示最新科技成就的展览馆……每天吸引着国内外成千上万的游人。然而有谁会想到：这些妙不可言令人眼花缭乱的美好去处，能提供给游人作为宴请宾客的厅堂，旅游者可以在摆满无价之宝的皇家宫苑等胜地就餐、跳舞，甚至连奥塞博物馆、凡尔赛桔园、皇家监房等威严的场所也不例外。埃菲尔铁塔附近的航海博物馆餐厅，每次为游人提供１０００人立席或４００人坐席。每逢博物馆周二闭馆后，厨师们就从下午４时起为游人忙碌起来。一次租金３０００至２２０００法郎不等，主要根据租用厅堂面积的大小、设施好坏及时间长短而定。
    有些游客喜欢沉浸于中世纪气氛之中进食，可到西岱岛上的皇家牢房用餐。一次付２８０００法郎（不包括食品费），可以使上千名来宾尽兴而归。据说，要租这里的宴会厅，还需要６个月前预定哩！
    离卢浮宫不远，一个坐落在塞纳河右岸的装饰艺术博物馆，有两层楼的场地可供进餐。一夜租金１５至２０法郎。每天对游客开放。这里接待顾客兼办宴会已有多年历史了。
    凡尔赛宫庭院里的桔园，是露天宴会的理想场所。客人们背靠太阳王路易十四当年驾临的宫殿，出席有３０００人参加的鸡尾酒会，使人终身难忘。每年６至１０月，谁肯付６万法郎的租金，就可以在此主持通宵宴会。建于１９世纪的奥塞博物馆，每月向旅游者开放一天，票价为１０万法郎。届时有导游带领参观，外加一席鸡尾酒宴。其目的在于吸引游资，帮助博物馆兴办文化事业。
