Recently, the market price of piglets in some areas of our province has plummeted. According to investigations of markets in Dongying, Huimin, and other places, the transaction price of piglets has dropped from 3.3 yuan per 500 grams in early November 1988 to the current 1.4 yuan per 500 grams.

The main reason for this phenomenon is the rise in grain prices. By January 5 of this year, the average price of rice on the market was 1.92 yuan per kilogram, and the average price of corn was 0.72 yuan per kilogram, up 104.2% and 63.6% respectively from the same period last year. Currently, grain prices are still on an upward trend. Farmers feel that raising pigs is a low-profit, high-risk venture, so they naturally want to sell their piglets.

If this situation continues, the number of pigs in storage this year will inevitably decrease sharply, and people will have no pork to eat. Relevant departments should pay high attention to this situation and take effective measures as soon as possible to reverse this unfavorable trend in pig production.

### 仔猪跌价　情况反常

　　仔猪跌价　情况反常
    近期来，我省一些地方的生猪市场仔猪价格猛跌。据对东营、惠民等地集市的调查，仔猪市场成交价由１９８８年１１月初的每５００克３．３元，猛跌到目前的每５００克１．４元。
    引起这一现象的主要原因是粮价上涨。到今年１月５日，集市上每公斤大米的平均价格为１．９２元，每公斤玉米平均价格为０．７２元，分别比去年同期上涨１０４．２％和６３．６％。目前，粮食价格还有上涨趋势。农民感到养猪本大利小，自然要把仔猪卖掉。
    照此情况发展下去，今年生猪存栏量必将急剧减少，人们将无猪肉可食。有关部门应高度重视这一情况，尽快采取有效措施，扭转这一不利发展生猪生产的局面。
