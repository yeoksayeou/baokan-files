Recently, a joint venture by the United States, Britain, and the European Economic Community launched an ultraviolet exploration satellite. It detected a star in the constellation Cancer, located east of Gemini and west of Leo. This star has a diameter three times that of the Sun. Scientific research has revealed that its surface is covered by a layer of rich gold ore, with a total gold reserve of over 1,000 billion tons, equivalent to 16 million times the total gold reserves on Earth. It can truly be called a gold star.

With the development of science and technology, one day in the future, it may become an inexhaustible treasure trove for humanity.

　　一星球有富金矿
    不久前，由美国、英国与欧洲经济共同体联合发射的一颗紫外线探索卫星，探测到位于双子座以东、狮子座以西的巨蟹座中，有一颗直径为太阳３倍的星球。经科学研究，发现它的表面有一层富金矿覆盖，黄金储量共达１０００多亿吨，相当于地球上黄金总储量的１６０万倍。可说是一颗真正的金星。
    随着科技的发展，将来有一天它也许会成为人类取之不尽的金库。
