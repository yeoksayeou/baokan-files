Vietnam's predicament over its troops in Cambodia is hard to express.
Vietnam remains silent on Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan.

	Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 16 — All official newspapers in Vietnam today maintained silence on the major event of the Soviet troops' complete withdrawal from Afghanistan yesterday.

	Today, Hanoi's newspapers did not report on the news of the Soviet Union completing its withdrawal from Afghanistan according to schedule, nor did they publish any comments.

	The official newspaper of the Vietnamese Communist Party, the People's Daily, only published an article written by the acting charge d'affaires of the Kabul government in Vietnam, claiming that the government forces in Kabul have sufficient ability to defend Afghanistan's territorial integrity and sovereignty.

	Hanoi's media's silence on the complete withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan reflects the Vietnamese government's unspoken "difficulties."

　　军队驻柬“苦衷”难言   
    越对苏撤军保持缄默
    新华社河内２月１６日电  越南所有官方报纸今天对苏联军队于昨天全部撤离阿富汗这一重大事件保持缄默。
    河内各报今天既不报道苏联按计划完成从阿撤军的消息，也没有发表任何评论。
    越共党报《人民报》只刊登了喀布尔政权驻越临时代办撰写的一篇文章，声称喀布尔政府军有足够的能力保卫阿富汗的领土完整和主权。
    河内新闻界对苏军全部撤出阿富汗保持缄默，反映了越南当局有难言的“苦衷”。
