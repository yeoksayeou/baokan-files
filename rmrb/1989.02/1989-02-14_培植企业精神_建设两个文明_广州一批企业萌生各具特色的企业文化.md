Currently, the construction of corporate culture in Guangzhou is thriving.

Corporate culture is a hot topic in the global business world today. Five years ago, Baiyunshan Pharmaceutical Factory and Nanfang Grand Department Store, among other enterprises, proposed developing corporate culture and cultivating corporate spirit. In August 1987, the municipal government submitted the "Guangzhou Cultural Development Strategic Outline" to the Standing Committee of the Guangzhou People's Congress for approval, which clearly stated that "we should actively promote the budding corporate culture within enterprises." The relevant departments of the municipal committee then selected one industry and 10 enterprises as pilot projects, making corporate culture construction in the entire city develop from point to surface and gradually deepen.

After several years of exploration, many enterprises have now formed their unique corporate spirits. For example, the corporate spirit of Baiyunshan Pharmaceutical Factory is "love the factory, seek profits, be practical, and strive for progress"; the corporate spirit of Wanbao Electrical Appliance Industrial Company is "pioneering, struggling, scientific, and master"; the corporate spirit of Donghua Industrial Company is "united hearts, striving forward"; and the corporate spirit of Panyu Meishan Industrial Company is "pioneering and practical, scientific innovation, benefiting the country and the factory, and collective development." Many enterprises also have their own songs, emblems, flags, and even colors. The corporate culture color of Nanfang Grand Department Store is green, white, and gold. Green represents vitality and hope; white represents sincerity and purity, openness and selflessness; gold represents prosperity and a bright future.

In an experience-sharing session, more than 50 entrepreneurs from the Guangzhou region deeply felt that corporate culture is the foundation of spiritual civilization construction and the link between material civilization construction. By grasping this link, it is possible to achieve the simultaneous development of the two civilizations.

　　培植企业精神　建设两个文明    
    广州一批企业萌生各具特色的企业文化
    本报广州电  记者梁兆明报道：当前，广州企业文化建设呈现蓬勃发展的势头。
    企业文化是当今世界企业界的一个热门话题。５年前，白云山制药总厂、南方大厦百货商店等几个企业提出发展企业文化，培植企业精神。１９８７年８月，市政府提请市人大常委会通过的《广州文化发展战略纲要》中，明确提出“要积极推动已在企业内部萌芽生长的企业文化”，市委有关部门又抓了一个行业和１０个企业作试点，使企业文化建设在全市由点及面，并逐步向纵深发展。
    经过几年的探索，目前许多企业已形成各具特色的企业精神。比如，“爱厂、兴利、求实、进取”的白云山制药总厂精神；“开拓、拚搏、科学、主人翁”的万宝电器工业公司精神；“同心、奋拓”的东华实业公司精神和“开拓唯实、科学图新、利国利厂、集团发展”的番禺梅山实业总公司精神。不少企业还有自己的歌、徽、旗，甚至颜色。南方大厦百货商店的企业文化颜色为绿、白、金三色，绿色代表生机活力，充满希望；白色代表真诚纯洁，坦荡无私；金色代表繁荣昌盛，前景灿烂。
    在一次经验交流中，广州地区５０多位企业家深有体会地说，企业文化是精神文明建设的基础工程，是物质文明建设的结合部。抓住这个结合部，就可望达到两个文明建设比翼齐飞。
