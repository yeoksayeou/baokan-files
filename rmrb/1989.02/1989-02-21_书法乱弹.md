	Calligraphy, in our country, has always emphasized the cultivation of imagery in the brush and the expression of beauty in the strokes. The script is a record of the heart's movements and emotions, a manifestation of beautiful thoughts, and a revelation of the spirit's essence. As the saying goes, "Characters are the portrait of the heart."

	When people appreciate calligraphy, they often find themselves captivated by the various emotions conveyed, whether bold, elegant, soft, or subdued. Those with discerning eyes, when viewing masterpieces of calligraphy, feel as if they have entered a realm of immortals. They see the characters as thunder, as clouds, as rainbows, as springs bursting from the mountains, or lotuses emerging from the water. They sense the rhythm as waves, as ripples, as flowing streams, as shooting stars, or as waterfalls cascading, or the sea roaring. Indeed, the strokes are like footprints, and the meaning of the characters is like the traces of the heart, leading one into a unique emotional realm, an extraordinary atmosphere, making one resonate, harmonize, and dance with the emotions and spirit.

	The calligraphy master Shen Yimo once insightfully pointed out in his evaluation of Chinese calligraphy: "The world recognizes Chinese calligraphy as the highest art because it displays astonishing miracles: it has no color but possesses the brilliance of a painting, it has no sound but possesses the harmony of music, attracting admiration and bringing joy to the heart and spirit." This is a profound statement that captures the essence. Therefore, Chinese calligraphy is indeed a unique artistic landscape in the world of art.

	Calligraphy is a reflection of an individual's cultural refinement and a display of emotional quality. Thus, the use of writing techniques and the pursuit of calligraphy art is not just the concern of calligraphers.

　　书法乱弹
    我国古来讲究蓄意象于笔底，发美情于毫端，而笔迹正是心动情移的记录，美思拂动的成形，神骨洞达的显影，所谓“字为心画”者正是。
    人们在观赏书法作品时，时常会为或豪放或潇洒或浅唱或低吟的情声擒纵，时常会被或刚劲或纤秾或粗犷或秀雅的情景整合。有鉴赏能力者观书法精品，不亚于步入仙境，视其字形如雷，如云，如霓，如虹，如泉之出山，荷之出水；观其气韵如波，如漾，如流，如射，如瀑之跌落，海之啸歌。真个是字迹如足迹，字意如心迹，引人入情灵之特殊境界，情绪之异常氛围，使其共鸣、谐振，情灵共舞。
    书法大家沈尹默先生在评说我国书法时曾精辟地指出：“世人公认中国书法是最高艺术，就是因为它显示了惊人奇迹，无色而具画图的灿烂，无声而有声音的和谐，引人欣赏，心畅神怡。”乃揭本撮魂之说。故尔，中国书法实为世界艺术图谱中独树一格的一大艺术景观。
    书法，是个体文化素质的门面，又是情感素质的显露。因此，运用书写技巧，讲求书法艺术，也就不只是书法家的事了。
