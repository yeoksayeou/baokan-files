Li Peng Reiterates China's Position to Sihanouk
Vietnam Should Withdraw Troops from Cambodia Without Preconditions
Cambodia's Internal Issues Should Be Resolved Through Consultation Among Cambodian Parties

BEIJING, Feb. 1 (Xinhua) — Premier Li Peng reiterated China's position on the Cambodian issue during a meeting with Prince Norodom Sihanouk and his wife at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse tonight.

Li Peng pointed out that since Vietnam has agreed to withdraw its troops from Cambodia by the end of September this year, it should genuinely and completely withdraw its troops without any preconditions. The withdrawal should be conducted under effective international supervision. Vietnamese troops should not remain in Cambodia by simply changing their uniforms.

Li Peng emphasized that China opposes Vietnam's demand to stop aiding the resistance forces as a condition for withdrawal. He said, "We believe that as Vietnam genuinely withdraws, all parties, including Vietnam and the Soviet Union, should gradually reduce and eventually completely stop military aid to various factions in Cambodia." Li Peng said that Cambodia's internal issues should be resolved through consultations among Cambodian parties. China supports the establishment of a quadripartite interim joint government led by Prince Sihanouk and also supports the proposal to freeze and reduce the military forces of various factions in Cambodia.

Prince Sihanouk reiterated his five-point proposal for resolving the Cambodian issue. He stressed that he would strive for Cambodia's complete independence and national self-determination and would never yield to Vietnam.

Sihanouk pointed out that the international community has only focused on the danger of the Khmer Rouge regaining power, but has not paid attention to the danger of Vietnam's colonization of Cambodia. He said that this danger is even greater than the danger of the Khmer Rouge regaining power.

Sihanouk reiterated that elections should not be held within the framework of the so-called "People's Republic of Kampuchea." He said that he could not agree to the establishment of a so-called "National Reconciliation Committee," but rather a four-party interim national reconciliation joint government should be established. The military forces of various factions in Cambodia should be frozen and reduced to 10,000. He said, "This is not only my position, but also the common position of the three Cambodian resistance forces."

Li Peng expressed China's support for Prince Sihanouk's five-point proposal for resolving the Cambodian issue. He said, "This five-point proposal is the common position of the three Cambodian resistance forces and has also received support from the international community." After the meeting, Li Peng hosted a banquet in honor of Prince Sihanouk and his wife. Li Peng's wife, Zhu Lin, and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen attended the meeting and the banquet. Cambodian representative to China, Jiang Yulang, also attended the banquet.

　　李鹏向西哈努克重申中国立场
    越从柬全部撤军不应有先决条件
    柬国内问题应由柬各方协商解决
    新华社北京二月一日电  （记者张荣典）国务院总理李鹏今晚在钓鱼台国宾馆会见诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王和夫人时重申了中国对解决柬埔寨问题的立场。
    李鹏指出，越南既然答应在今年九月底前从柬埔寨撤军，它就应当真正地全部撤军，不应有先决条件，而且应该在有效的国际监督下进行。越军不能以改换军装的方法继续留在柬埔寨。
    李鹏强调指出，中国不同意越南把停止对抵抗力量的援助作为撤军的条件。他说，“我们认为随着越南真正撤军，所有各方，包括越南和苏联都应当逐步减少乃至完全停止对柬埔寨各派的军事援助。”李鹏说，柬埔寨国内问题应由柬埔寨各方协商解决。中国支持建立以西哈努克亲王为首的四方临时联合政府，也支持冻结和削减柬埔寨各派军队的主张。
    西哈努克亲王重申了他提出的关于解决柬埔寨问题的五点建议。他强调，他要为柬埔寨百分之百的独立和柬埔寨的民族自决进行奋斗，决不向越南屈服。
    西哈努克指出，现在国际上只注意到了红色高棉重新掌权的危险，而没有注意到越南对柬埔寨的殖民化的危险。而这种危险要比红色高棉重新掌权的危险更大。
    西哈努克重申，决不能在所谓的“柬埔寨人民共和国”这个框架内进行选举。他说，他不能同意成立一个所谓“民族和解委员会”，而应当建立一个四方临时民族和解联合政府。柬埔寨各派的部队应该冻结并削减至一万人。他说，“这不仅是我西哈努克的立场，也是柬埔寨三方抵抗力量的共同立场。”
    李鹏表示，中国支持西哈努克亲王提出的关于解决柬埔寨问题的五点建议。他说，“这五点建议是柬埔寨三方抵抗力量的共同主张，而且也得到了国际社会的支持。”会见后，李鹏设宴款待西哈努克亲王和夫人。李鹏总理的夫人朱琳、钱其琛外长等参加了会见并出席了宴会。民柬驻华大使江裕朗等出席宴会。
