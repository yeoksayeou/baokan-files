The Kabul regime has once again re-employed former Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Kishtmand, to oversee cabinet work.

Kabul regime leader Najibullah yesterday reconstituted a high-level committee. This committee consists of 6 members, including 3 deputy chairmen of the Council of Ministers and 2 ministers. The committee is led by Kishtmand.

Kabul Radio said that Kishtmand will be in charge of the Council of Ministers' affairs.

Kishtmand is a member of the Central Committee of the People's Democratic Party. He resigned from his position as Chairman of the Council of Ministers last May.

Western analysts believe that Kishtmand's return to office is another measure taken by Najibullah to strengthen the ruling party's leadership role in the government.

　　喀布尔政权再次起用前总理
    新华社北京２月２２日电  喀布尔消息：喀布尔政权再次起用前部长会议主席基什特曼德，负责主持内阁工作。
    喀布尔政权领导人纳吉布拉昨天又组建了一个高级委员会。这个委员会由６人组成，其中包括３名部长会议副主席和两名部长。委员会由基什特曼德领导。
    喀布尔广播电台说，基什特曼德将负责内阁部长会议事务。
    基什特曼德是人民民主党中央委员。他于去年５月辞去部长会议主席职务。
    西方分析家认为，基什特曼德复职是纳吉布拉加强执政党在政府中领导作用的又一措施。
