Four years ago, television cameras were permitted to enter the British House of Lords to film the debates of the noble lords, which was well-received by television viewers. Now, many members of the House of Commons hope to allow voters to understand the process of national affairs through television, thereby increasing political transparency. It is said that this matter is still in the planning stages.

At the same time, the British Law Society, using the United States as an example, strongly urged the judicial authorities to also allow television stations to film court proceedings. A working group of the Law Society had visited the United States and found that 44 states in America already allow television reporters to conduct live broadcasts from the courts. However, since 1925, British courts have barred even ordinary photographers.

The head of the Law Society's working group, senior lawyer Kaplan, said that due to the development of modern technology, television cameras have become more portable and can shoot from a distance in dimly lit environments. Court trials are public activities that the people are concerned about, and advanced media can help the people fully understand the British judicial system.

The judicial authorities, however, hold a cautious and reserved attitude towards this "revolutionary" proposal. Some senior judges say that if television reporters are allowed into the courtroom, it will interfere with the trial process, especially affecting witnesses' statements about confidential matters, and will also distract the judges and jurors. Former Supreme Court Justice Lawson said, "Court trials are not a form of entertainment." Some judges also worry that television stations might turn the trial of a case into a television drama.

Several television companies are very interested in this issue. Their technicians say that to avoid television camera crews moving around in the courtroom and disrupting normal work, remote control methods can be used for filming, or only one remote-controlled camera can be used in the courtroom to film the entire trial process, and then several television stations can edit and compile the footage outside the courtroom.

However, British judges are still not reassured, because they know that some television stations in New York City last year had edited many "highlight" clips of major criminal trials for broadcast, not to promote the rule of law, but to satisfy the curiosity of television viewers, to increase viewership, and to expand the influence of the television station.

The television side, however, counters that understanding the process of general civil and criminal cases is the right of the people, and therefore it should be broadcast live.

How this issue will ultimately be resolved probably depends on the British House of Commons and the Supreme Court, and people can only wait and see.

　　法庭审案与现场直播
    陈封文并图
    ４年前电视摄像机被准许进入英国国会上议院拍摄贵族议员辩论情况，颇受电视观众欢迎。现在许多下议院议员也希望能使选民通过电视了解下议院辩论国家大事的过程，以增加政治透明度。据说此事尚在酝酿阶段。
    与此同时，英国律师协会以美国为例，强烈要求司法当局也准许电视台拍摄法庭审理案件的情况。律师协会的一个工作组曾到美国调查，看到美国已有４４个州的法庭允许电视记者进行现场直播。而英国的法庭自１９２５年以后连普通摄影记者都被挡驾。
    律师协会工作组组长、高级律师卡普兰说，由于现代科技的发展，使电视摄像机变得更轻便，并能在光线暗淡的环境中进行远距离拍摄，而法庭审案属于人民所关心的公开性活动，先进的传播媒介恰好能使人民充分了解英国的司法制度。
    司法当局对这个“革命性”的建议则持谨慎的保留意见。一些资深的法官说如果让电视台记者深入法庭，就会干扰审案进程，尤其会直接影响证人陈述有关隐情，同时也会分散法官和陪审团的注意力。前最高法院法官劳森爵士说：“法庭审案并不是一种娱乐形式。”有的法官还担心电视台会把某一案件的审理情况改编成电视剧。
    几家电视公司对这个问题很感兴趣。它们的技师说为了避免电视摄像人员在法庭内走动而干扰正常工作，可以利用遥控手段摄像，或者只以一架遥控摄像机在现场拍摄审案全过程，再由数家电视台人员在法庭外根据转录片进行剪裁和编辑。
    但是英国法官们仍不放心，因为他们了解到美国纽约市的一些电视台去年就曾剪辑不少审理重大刑事案的“精彩”镜头予以播映，目的并不是弘扬法治，而是为了满足电视观众的好奇心，以提高收视率，扩大电视台的影响。
    电视台方面则反驳说，了解一般民刑案件的审理过程是人民的权利，所以应该进行现场转播。
    这个问题最终将如何解决，大概要由英国下议院和最高法院来决定，人们只好耐着性子等着瞧。（附图片）
