The first-ever Chinese Lantern Riddle Art Festival opened this morning in Zhangzhou City, amidst the festive atmosphere of the Lantern Festival. Fourteen riddle enthusiasts from Taiwan were warmly welcomed by over 100 mainland riddle enthusiasts.

Mr. Li, a Taiwanese compatriot, said, "The moment I set foot on Minnan soil, I felt a sense of familiarity. We not only share a common language but also a deep understanding of each other's hearts!" The Taiwanese riddle enthusiasts also expressed their hope that one day they could welcome mainland riddle enthusiasts at the foot of Alishan Mountain and by the side of Sun Moon Lake, to fulfill their duties as hosts.
