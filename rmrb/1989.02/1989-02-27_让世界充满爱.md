Prominent social activist Fei Lulu has no children of her own, but many wayward youths who have no family affectionately call her "Mom" —
Let the World Be Filled with Love
By Lai Renqiong, People's Daily Reporter

At the start of the new year, the Central Propaganda Department and the Communist Youth League Central Committee held a conference in Beijing to commend 100 outstanding youth ideological educators. Among the many awardees, an elderly woman with white hair stood out. She is Fei Lulu, a Beijing Municipal Political Consultative Conference Standing Committee member and renowned social activist, who has made outstanding contributions to the education and rescue of wayward youths.

“For My Children”

Recently, the reporter visited Fei Lulu's residence in Baiwanzhuang. Upon seeing me, the amiable Fei Lulu immediately said, "The day before yesterday, I went with neighborhood officials to Qinghe and Chahe Farm to visit police officers and inmates, and I just returned yesterday afternoon."

At the age of 76, Fei Lulu fell during the Beijing Municipal Political Consultative Conference last year, fracturing her left wrist and left leg. Friends were concerned that this elderly woman, who had previously suffered from heart failure combined with kidney failure, might never recover. To everyone's surprise, after lying in bed for several months, she is now able to walk again.

Whenever she talks about her children, Fei Lulu becomes particularly spirited. In fact, Fei Lulu has no biological children. The "children" she refers to are wayward youths from all over the country.

Fei Lulu, who has experienced many hardships, began to devote herself to the "systematic project" of reform schools and juvenile detention centers with great enthusiasm in 1979. This former judge, who once presided over the "Thirteen Tigers" and "Nine Dragons, One Phoenix" gang cases in the Tianjin Court, has since been appointed as the principal of seven reform schools in Beijing.

Once, Fei Lulu received a letter from an unknown youth: "Grandma Fei: I am a peasant's son. While studying at a medical college, I was sentenced to two years in prison for theft. After being released from prison, my family did not take me in, and the school did not accept me. The vast 9.6 million square kilometers of our motherland, is there no place for me to stand? I really want to die." Fei Lulu immediately replied to this youth and found the manager of Shanxi Linfen Metal Structure Factory, Shi Huixi, who was in Beijing for a meeting, asking him to take in this youth. Later, this youth named Liu Yunbo went from Shandong to Shanxi Linfen to work and often wrote letters to Fei Lulu reporting his thoughts and work situation.

When discussing the difficulties faced by wayward youths in finding employment, Fei Lulu has many regrets: "Although many enlightened managers have taken in my children, the reluctance to accept wayward youths is still a common phenomenon in society. I always think that wayward youths are also youths, and they are also the hope and future of the country."

The Unique “Individual Entrepreneur”

Two years ago, Fei Lulu heard about an unfortunate family in Chaoyang District: the husband killed his wife and was sentenced to death, leaving a pair of sisters and brothers as orphans with no means of livelihood. To ensure the living and school expenses of the two minors, Fei Lulu ran to the neighborhood and relevant departments to persuade and reason until the problem was properly solved. Fei Lulu said with some worry, "The murderer is guilty, but the children are not. How can the children be left unmanaged?"

Some people say Fei Lulu loves to fight for justice, some say she loves to meddle in other people's business, and some simply call her the "Minister of Non-Department." Fei Lulu, however, humorously calls herself an "individual entrepreneur."

However, Fei Lulu's individual enterprise is unique: she only does practical work and does not engage in business. Her home is like a "social affairs office." She and the two secretaries she hired at her own expense not only provide various services for those "children" free of charge but also handle a large number of matters that should be managed but are not. In the 1980s, when even small businesses could make big money, Fei Lulu's "assets" were increasingly depleted—her parents' inheritance was almost used up. Her monthly salary is over 200 yuan, but her monthly expenses for secretaries and drivers, telephone fees, postal fees, and various office supplies amount to over a thousand yuan. Although she is doing "public" work, Fei Lulu has never thought of asking the state for help.

Fei Lulu was born into a wealthy family of high-level intellectuals in Beijing. Her father, Fei Qihe, studied in the United States in his early years and returned to China to found the Beijing Financial and Commercial Special School, a famous vocational educator in China. Under her father's influence, Fei Lulu, who is kind-hearted and multi-talented, started engaging in social charity and relief work with great enthusiasm from her youth, out of sympathy and pity for the weak and orphaned children. During the War of Resistance, she and her husband Liu Renshu transformed from sympathetic patriotic merchants to steadfast revolutionaries. After liberation, she generously donated money to support national construction and later donated all her factories, equipment, and shops to the state.

Fei Lulu's life is quite frugal. Her shirts and pants are patched in several places but she is reluctant to throw them away. To solve the problem of not having time to eat due to her busy work, she buys 100 packets of instant noodles at a time. During our conversation, I learned that Fei Lulu, who was once extremely wealthy, was about to face an "economic crisis." Fei Lulu calmly said, "This summer, I plan to go out and ask some relatives and friends abroad for money, and then establish a foundation. At that time, I will have some assets. I will also be at ease."

“The Setting Sun Is Not Necessarily Inferior to the Morning Sun”

In the past decade, Fei Lulu has been busy educating and rescuing wayward youths. The calendar on her desk has notes on every page. She often works until midnight and starts again at 4 am. Before 1978, Fei Lulu worked in the countryside. Her husband learned that she often lived and ate with the "children" of the reform schools and was very worried about her already weak body. The elderly Mr. Liu, over 70, often rode his motorcycle to see her. Fei Lulu said emotionally, "My husband suffers from Parkinson's syndrome, and I should take good care of him at home. But for the sake of the children, I have to let him down."

Her husband, a member of the State Council's Advisory Committee, became Fei Lulu's "ally," and many people from the legal, cultural, and military sectors have contributed to Fei Lulu's "systematic project" and became reliable "reserves." Fei Lulu has a very wide social circle. She invited "China's Paul" Wu Yunduo to give lectures to the "children"; she invited the most popular grandfather, Sun Jingxiu, to tell stories at the reform school; she invited Peking opera performers, variety artists, and ballet dancers to perform for the reform students and wayward youths.

In October 1988, Fei Lulu attended the "International Symposium on Minor Offenses by Youth Students" in Shanghai in a wheelchair. At the meeting, which had representatives from 14 countries including England, the United States, the Federal Republic of Germany, Japan, and Switzerland, Fei Lulu gave a speech in fluent English titled "Let the World Be Filled with Love." Professor Colin of Saint Joseph University in the United States said to Fei Lulu, "In the past, I knew that the Communist Party only talked about struggle. Today, for the first time, I heard from Ms. Fei that the Communist Party also talks about love."

“May the heavens grant a longer time, the setting sun is not necessarily inferior to the morning sun.” Fei Lulu wrote these lines to encourage herself to continue her selfless and boundless love.

### “让世界充满爱”

    著名社会活动家费路路没有子嗣，但许多六亲不认的失足青少年深情地叫她“妈妈”——
    “让世界充满爱”
    本报记者　赖仁琼
    新年伊始，中宣部和共青团中央在北京举行大会，表彰百名“全国优秀青年思想教育工作者”。在众多获奖者中，有位鬓发花白的古稀老人格外引人注目。她，就是为教育挽救失足青少年做出卓越贡献的北京市政协常委、著名社会活动家费路路。
    　　　　“为了我的孩子们”
    最近，记者到百万庄费路路的寓所看望她。一见面，和蔼可亲的费大姐就告诉我：“前天，我跟街道的同志一起去清河、茶淀农场慰问干警和看望服刑人员，昨天中午才回来。”
    ７６岁高龄的费大姐在去年出席北京市政协会议时不慎跌倒，左腕、左腿两处骨折。朋友们担心这位曾患心力衰竭合并肾衰竭的老人再也爬不起来。谁料她在病床上躺了几个月后，如今又行走自如了。
    每当提起孩子，费大姐就特别来精神。其实，费大姐没有一个亲生儿女，她说的“孩子们”，是指全国各地的失足青少年。
    历尽坎坷的费大姐从１９７９年便以极大的热情投入了工读学校、少管所的“系统工程”。这位当年曾在天津法院审理“十三太保”、“九龙一凤”流氓盗窃集团的女法官，先后被聘为北京７所工读学校的校长。
    一次，费大姐收到一封陌生青年的来信：“费奶奶：我是个农家子弟，在医学院就读时因盗窃被判刑２年。从监狱出来后，家里不留，学校不收，天茫茫，地茫茫，祖国９６０万平方公里的土地上，难道没有我的立足之地吗？我真想一死了之。”费大姐立即给这个青年回信，又找到正在北京开会的山西临汾金属结构厂厂长师回喜，请他收下这个青年。后来，这个叫刘云波的青年从山东到了山西临汾做工，还经常写信给费大姐汇报思想和工作情况。
    谈及失足青少年就业难，费大姐感慨颇多：“虽然不少开明的厂长都收过我的孩子，但不愿要失足青少年仍是社会较普遍的现象。我总想，失足青少年也是青少年，他们同样是国家的希望和未来。”
    　　　　独一无二的“个体户”
    两年前，费大姐听说朝阳区有个不幸的家庭：丈夫杀死了妻子被判死刑，留下一对小姐弟成了生活无着落的孤儿。为了落实两个未成年孩子的生活费、学杂费，费大姐跑街道和有关部门磨嘴皮、讲道理，直到问题得到妥善解决。费大姐不无忧虑地说：“杀人犯有罪而孩子无罪，孩子怎能没人管？”
    有人说费大姐爱打抱不平，有人说她爱管闲事，有人干脆叫她“不管部部长”。费大姐却风趣地说自己是“个体户”。
    不过，费大姐这个个体户很独特：只办实事不搞经营。她的家像个“社会事务所”，她和她自费请来的两位秘书除了无偿为那些“孩子们”提供各种服务外，还管了大量该管而又没人管的“闲事”。在做小买卖也能赚大钱的８０年代，费大姐的“家底”日见亏空——父母留下的钱快花光了。她的月工资２００多元，但她每月支出的秘书和司机的工资、电话费、邮电费及各项办公用品费等不下千元。虽然办的是“公家”的事，但费大姐从未想过向国家伸手。
    费路路出生在北京一个富有的高级知识分子家庭。父亲费起鹤早年留学美国，回国后创办了北京财政商业专门学校，是我国著名的职业教育家。在父亲的教育影响下，心地善良、多才多艺的费路路从青年时代起，基于对弱者和孤苦儿童的同情、怜悯，以极大的热情从事社会慈善事业和救济活动。抗战期间，她和丈夫刘仁术从同情革命的爱国富商变为坚定的革命者。解放后，她曾慷慨献金支援国家建设，以后又陆续把自己的工厂、设备、商店全部捐献给了国家。
    费大姐的生活相当节俭。她的衬衣衬裤打了好几个补丁还舍不得扔掉。为了解决工作繁忙顾不上吃饭的问题，她一买方便面就是１００袋。交谈中我得知，曾经极富有的费大姐眼看就要发生“经济危机”了。费大姐不慌不忙地说：“今年夏天我准备出去一趟，向国外的亲友要些钱，然后成立个基金会。那时就有点家底了。我也就放心了。”
    　　　　“夕阳未必逊晨曦”
    近１０年间，费大姐不停地为教育挽救失足青少年而忙碌。她的写字台上的日历，每一页都有记事。她常常是深夜１２点才睡，凌晨４点又工作。１９７８年前，费大姐在农村劳动。老伴得知她常与工读学校的“孩子们”同吃同住，很担心她那本来就虚弱的身体。７旬多的刘老先生经常骑上摩托车去看她。费大姐动情地说：“我老伴患有帕金森氏综合症，我本该在家好好照顾他。但为了孩子们，只好委屈他了。”
    身为国务院参事的老伴成了费大姐的“同盟军”，政法、文艺、军队各界的不少人都曾为费大姐这项“系统工程”出过力而成了可靠的“后备军”。费大姐社交面极广，她邀请“中国的保尔”吴运铎给“孩子们”演讲；邀请最受孩子们欢迎的孙敬修老爷爷到工读学校讲故事；邀请京剧演员、曲艺演员、芭蕾舞演员为工读生和失足青年们表演。
    １９８８年１０月，费大姐坐着轮椅出席了在上海举行的“青少年学生轻微犯罪国际研讨会”。在这有英、美、联邦德国、日本、瑞士等１４个国家代表参加的会上，费大姐用流利的英文作了题为《让世界充满爱》的发言，美国圣约瑟夫大学教授柯伦对费大姐说：“过去我知道共产党只讲斗争，今天第一次从费女士嘴里听到共产党也讲爱。”
    “但愿苍天宽时限，夕阳未必逊晨曦”。费大姐写下这诗句勉励自己继续奉献她无私、博大的爱！（附图片）
