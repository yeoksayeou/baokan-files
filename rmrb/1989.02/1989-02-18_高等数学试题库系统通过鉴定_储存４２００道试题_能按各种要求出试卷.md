The first phase of the "High-Level Mathematics Test Bank System," a key project in the State Education Commission's "Seventh Five-Year Plan" for educational science, was officially approved in Beijing on February 16.

This system was jointly developed by four institutions: Xi'an Jiaotong University, Beijing Institute of Technology, South China University of Technology, and the Shanghai University Engineering Mathematics Cooperative Group. The system stores 4,200 test questions and can quickly generate test papers in Chinese, output answer points, scoring criteria, and various information tables according to different requirements. It can provide test papers for high-level mathematics at five different levels. After being used in over 50 universities nationwide, it has proven to be effective and fully meets the basic requirements set by the State Education Commission. Its successful development marks an important step forward in the modernization and scientific management of examination methods in China.
