Recently, the municipal federation of trade unions in our city conducted a survey of the labor protection conditions in 12 street enterprises. These enterprises have a total of 465 male workers and 881 female workers. Female workers play an indispensable role in production, but their labor protection conditions are extremely poor.

Living and welfare conditions are low. Among the 12 enterprises, only two have rest rooms for shift workers. Over the past few years, only Dongfeng Printing Factory and Longshan Plywood Factory have conducted one health check-up for women. The disease rate among female workers is over 65%. These female workers do not have medical insurance, and work-related injuries only cover medical expenses for up to half a year.

The troubles after childbirth. In 8 out of the 12 enterprises, female workers do not receive wages during their maternity leave. Some small enterprises simply give female workers on maternity leave an extended leave. After childbirth, some female workers are affected in terms of salary adjustments and promotions. During the lactation period, 6 enterprises do not provide nursing time, resulting in some female workers being unable to attend work.

　　辽源街道企业女工劳保条件差
    最近，我市总工会调查了全市１２个街道企业的劳动保护状况。这些企业共有男工４６５人，女工８８１人。女工在生产中发挥了不可低估的作用，但她们的劳动保护条件却十分差。
    生活福利低。１２个企业中只有两个有倒班室。几年来，这些企业只有东风印刷厂和龙山胶合板厂搞了一次妇女病普查，女工的发病率在６５％以上。这些女工没有医疗费，工伤只给报销半年以内的医药费。
    生孩子后的苦恼。１２个企业中，有８个单位的女工产假期间不发工资。有的小企业干脆给生育期女工放长假。女工生育后，有的影响调资升级。在女工哺乳期，有６个单位不给喂奶时间，致使一些女工上不了班。
