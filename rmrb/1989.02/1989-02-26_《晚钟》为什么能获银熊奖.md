"The Evening Bell," a film that took three years from shooting to release, a film that failed miserably in the bidding for copies, and a film seen as symbolizing the "end of experimental films," won the Silver Bear Award, second only to the Golden Bear, at the Berlin International Film Festival. The news injected a stimulant into the Chinese film industry, which was feeling confused amid economic downturns and the wave of entertainment films.

Why did "The Evening Bell" win the award? Last year, Mr. De Hader, the chairman of the Berlin Film Festival, came to China specifically to select "The Evening Bell" from among dozens of new Chinese films. He said that the content of this film best suited the purpose of the Berlin Film Festival. Chen Kaige, who served as a jury member (a classmate of Wu Ziniu at the Beijing Film Academy), later analyzed:

"The Evening Bell" has two advantages: first, the subject matter is new, presenting a new understanding of war; second, it has unique artistic features, with very few dialogues and moving images. Some Western audiences said they didn't understand it, mainly because they are not familiar with the background of the Anti-Japanese War.

Five other films from the August First Film Studio participated in the "Panorama" screening at this film festival. Foreign friends showed great interest in the only military film studio in the world that produces narrative films. When they heard that there were foreign journalists who did not understand why the Chinese military film studio produced "The Evening Bell," a "anti-war" film, Zhou Keyu, the deputy director of the General Political Department who came to the August First Film Studio to congratulate, said: "Only those who have experienced war and understand war the most, know the value of peace."

On February 23, Wu Ziniu, just boarded the China Civil Aviation plane in Zurich, saw the report on the 22nd about "The Evening Bell" winning the award. He felt gratified about Hu Jian's arrangements for the film's release. On the 25th, at the celebration meeting held by the Film Bureau of the Ministry of Radio, Film, and Television, the China Film Association, and the August First Film Studio, Hu Jian further revealed that "The Evening Bell" will premiere at the opening of the Shanghai Art Cinema on March 10. He also hoped that Beijing would arrange a special screening like "Red Sorghum."

The awarding of "The Evening Bell" brought many enlightenments. Wu Ziniu said: "The position of Chinese films in the world is not strong yet, and we need to work hard." Chen Kaige said: "Whether we win the award or not, China must participate more in competitions and must have a place in major film festivals, so that others cannot look down on us." Chen Haosu said: "Chinese films must face both the world and the 1.1 billion domestic audience. There needs to be communication and understanding between artists and audiences."

　　《晚钟》为什么能获银熊奖
    本报记者  李彤
    《晚钟》，一部从拍摄到发行延宕了３年的影片，一部在征订拷贝中惨败的影片，一部被认为象征着“探索片的终结”的影片，在西柏林国际电影节上获得仅次于金熊奖的“首席”银熊奖。消息传来，给正在经济不景气和娱乐片大潮中感到困惑的中国电影界注入了一剂兴奋剂。
    《晚钟》为什么能获奖？西柏林电影节主席德·哈得尔先生去年专程来华，从几十部中国新片里选中《晚钟》时曾说：这部影片的内容最适合西柏林电影节的宗旨。荣任评委的陈凯歌（吴子牛在北京电影学院的同窗）事后分析道：
    《晚钟》占了两条优势，一是题材新，表现了对战争的新的认识；二是艺术上有特点，对话极少，画面动人。有些西方观众表示看不懂，主要是对抗日战争的背景不了解。
    八一厂的其他５部影片参加了此次电影节的“环顾”展映。各国朋友对当今世界上独此一家拍故事片的军队电影厂表示浓厚兴趣。当听说有外国记者不理解为什么中国军队的电影厂拍出《晚钟》这样一部“反战”的影片时，前来八一厂致贺的总政治部副主任周克玉说：只有亲历了战争、最了解战争的人，才最懂得和平的价值。
    ２月２３日，吴子牛在苏黎士刚登上中国民航的飞机，便看到本报２２日对《晚钟》获奖的报道，他对胡健总经理关于影片发行的安排感到欣慰。２５日，在广播电影电视部电影局、中国影协和八一厂召开的庆祝会上，胡健进一步透露，《晚钟》将在３月１０日上海文艺影院开幕时首映，他还希望北京市像《红高粱》一样尽快安排特别映出。
    《晚钟》获奖引来很多启示。吴子牛说：“中国电影在世界上的地位还不强大，还需艰苦努力。”陈凯歌说：“无论获奖不获奖，中国一定要多参赛，一定要在各大电影节上占有一席地位，这样就使人家不能小看。”陈昊苏说：“中国电影既要面向世界，也要面向国内的１１亿观众。艺术家与观众之间，需要沟通和理解。”
