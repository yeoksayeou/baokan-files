Universities Hide Athletic Potential

— Investigation of University Sports in Tianjin (Part One)

Three years ago, at the National University Games held in Dalian, the Tianjin university delegation was at the bottom of the rankings. The students were so embarrassed that they wore their sports uniforms inside out to hide the "Tianjin" logo.

Of course, hiding it didn't help; the lag was undeniable. This strong stimulus stung the Tianjin university community and alerted the municipal leaders. Fortunately, the "defeat in Dalian" brought Tianjin an opportunity to develop university sports. The Municipal Education Bureau reported to the Municipal Committee and gathered all the university leaders to a secluded area to re-evaluate university sports. The deputy director of the Education Bureau responsible for sports, Xing Yuansheng, humorously recalled this experience: "The importance of sports doesn't need to be proven by the Goldbach conjecture. If a university fails to excel in sports, its graduates will be weak and sickly, indicating a failure in education. When talking about national quality, a key indicator is physical fitness. From any perspective, we must prioritize sports." The leaders representing various schools all agreed to include sports in their college's important agenda. The enthusiasm for sports in various schools surged forward like water through an open sluice gate. Soon after, seven colleges applied to establish high-level sports teams, Nankai University formed a women's volleyball team, and the Finance and Economics College formed a women's basketball team.

Seven colleges, seven sports blooms, and everyone supported them like the moon among stars. Although schools are often underfunded, they have the advantage of teaching environments for nurturing sports talents, with sports teachers, sports psychology, physiology, and medical teachers; they have strong research capabilities and equipment; they have spacious campuses. All of these are hard to come by for provincial and municipal teams. If the schools' enthusiasm is mobilized, excellent sports teams will grow rapidly like seedlings in fertile soil.

The development of the seven sports blooms in Tianjin universities is indeed gratifying. Tianjin Normal University combines teaching, research, and training, establishing a track and field database and developing advanced sports testing equipment, greatly benefiting talents in both track and field and table tennis. The school already has one master athlete and 16 first-level athletes, winning 4 gold medals, 4 silver medals, and 5 bronze medals at the third University Games in Nanjing last year. The achievements of a single school exceeded the total achievements of all universities in Tianjin at the second University Games. Nankai University's women's volleyball team went to Zhangzhou for winter training last year, causing a stir among provincial and municipal teams. During the winter training, this university team consecutively defeated the youth teams of Jiangsu, August First, and Liaoning, and is now advancing towards the goal of becoming a first-tier team.

Through these achievements, people see not only the experience of Tianjin's higher education institutions but also the potential of colleges and universities to establish high-level sports teams. This potential, once released, is quite considerable. Deputy Director Xing Yuansheng shared some of his views at the request of the reporter. He said: "We have been experimenting with high-level sports teams for three years, and there are many new things. Universities indeed have great potential. Talent sources can be recruited nationwide, and we can select from the 9.6 million square kilometers of talent, which is difficult for provincial and municipal teams to achieve. As for coaches, we can invite excellent coaches through the exchange of teaching and research personnel, and we are already doing this, it's very simple. We can also use the exchange of overseas students to send sports talents abroad for training, the path is broad. Research capabilities, Tianjin has so many universities, with various functions, if we need medical support, we have it, if we need physiology, we have it, it doesn't take much effort to use. Many of the instruments used in the Seoul Olympics, our universities have them, and they are advanced. This is something that general provincial and municipal sports commissions cannot achieve. We have organized eight universities and two research institutes to form a sports research group, coordinating experts throughout the city. This potential is immeasurable. We say that we attach the wings of science to sports, that's real, not just a slogan. Food, accommodation, and venues are all readily available in universities, and the logistics for establishing high-level sports teams are also guaranteed." Xing Yuansheng told the reporter that their goal is to aim for the World University Games. Recently, Tianjin's colleges and universities have taken a new step in cultivating excellent sports teams, establishing the first echelon. Students who enter the first echelon have separate teaching plans and assigned teachers. Xing Yuansheng finally said: "Universities cultivate excellent sports teams by integrating the comprehensive strengths of university research, teaching, and other aspects, adopting a fully open form. Those who succeed can bring glory to the country, and those who are eliminated can transfer to other majors, avoiding the waste of talents, and solving the athletes' future." He believes that following this path, China's sports system will undergo significant changes.

　　校园深藏体育潜能
    ——天津市高校体育调查之一
    三年前，在大连举行的全国大学生运动会上，天津高校代表团名列榜尾，臊得学生把印有“天津”字样的运动衣翻过来穿。
    当然，藏也没用，落后是掩盖不了的。这个强刺激刺痛了天津高校界，惊动了市领导。令人高兴的是，“兵败大连”给天津市带来发展高校体育的契机。市高教局向市委汇报，并把所有高校的负责人拉到郊区一个无干扰的地方重新认识大学体育。高教局主管体育的副局长邢元敏在回忆这段经历时风趣地说：体育的重要性用不着哥德巴赫猜想，大学搞不好体育，出去的学生病号多体质弱，说明我们的教育失败。讲国民素质，重要的一个标杆就是身体素质，从哪一方面讲都要抓好。代表各个学校的领导都表示要把体育列入学院的重要议事日程。各校办体育的热潮如开闸之水奔涌向前。紧接着７所大专院校申请试办高水平运动队，南开大学建女排，财经学院组女篮。
    ７所院校７朵体育花，人们像众星捧月一样扶持它。学校虽然是清水衙门，但拥有体育人才成长的教学优势，有体育老师、运动心理、生理、医学教师等；拥有较强的科研力量和仪器；拥有宽阔的校舍。这一切是省市运动队难以得到的。如果把学校积极性调动起来，优秀运动队就会像沃土上的壮苗迅速成长。
    天津高校７朵花的发展确实令人高兴。天津师范大学把教学、科研、训练组合在一起，建立田径数据库，研制出先进体育测试仪，使田径和乒乓球两方面人才大大受益。该校已拥有健将１名、一级运动员１６人，在去年南京第三届大学生运动会上获得４枚金牌、４枚银牌和５枚铜牌。一个学校的成绩就超过全市所有高校在第二届大学生运动会的成绩总和。南开大学女排去年拉到漳州冬训，在省市队伍中引起震动。在冬训中，这支高校队接连战胜江苏、八一、辽宁等青年队，现正朝着甲级队的目标前进。
    透过成绩，人们看到的不仅是天津市高等院校经验，而是感觉到大专院校潜藏着办高水平运动队的能量，这种能量一旦释放出来是相当可观的。邢元敏副局长应记者要求谈了一些看法。他说：我们办高水平运动队，试验了三年，新东西不少，大学确有较大的潜力。人才来源，可以在全国招生，９６０万平方公里上的苗子都可选，这是省市队不易做到的。还有教练，我们可以通过交换教学科研人才的渠道把优秀的教练请进来，现在已经这样做了，很简单。还可以用互换留学生的办法，把体育尖子送到国外去培养，路子很宽广。科研力量，天津这么多大学，各种功能齐全，要医有医，要生理有生理，不费什么力就可拿来用上。汉城奥运会比赛很多仪器，我们大学都有，而且先进。这是一般省市体委做不到的。我们已组织８所大学、２个科研所成立体育科研组，协调全市的专家。这个潜力是难以估量的。我们说把科学的翅膀插在体育上，那是实打实的，不是口号。吃、住、场地大学都是现成，办高水平运动队的后勤也有保障。邢元敏告诉记者，他们的目标是瞄准世界大学生运动会。天津大专院校最近在培养优秀运动队又迈上新台阶，成立了第一梯队。凡进入第一梯队的学生，单独设教学计划，派授课教师。邢元敏最后说：“大学办优秀运动队综合大学科研、教学等各方力量，采取全方位开放的形式，成才者可为国争光，淘汰者可转学别的专业，不会出现浪费人才的状况，也解决了运动员的出路。”他认为沿着这条路走下去，中国体育体制将会出现大的改观。
