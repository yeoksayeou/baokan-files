Australian racewalking star sets world record

Xinhua News Agency, Canberra, February 9 (Reporter Xu Yu Nai) Australian Kerry Saxby broke the women's 3,000-meter racewalk world record on February 8 in Sydney.

The new record is 12 minutes 13.75 seconds, 0.73 seconds faster than the previous record she set three years ago and had held since then.

Saxby has broken the racewalking world record 17 times. Two weeks ago, she also refreshed the women's 10,000-meter racewalk world record.

Yesterday's competition was held in strong winds, which made it difficult to achieve good results. Saxby told reporters after the race that the participation of strong competitors from the Soviet Union, China, and others helped her create a world record in adverse weather conditions.

Saxby's next goal is to participate in the World Indoor Athletics Championships to be held next month in Budapest, Hungary.

　　澳竞走女杰创世界纪录
    新华社堪培拉二月九日电  （记者许钺乃）澳大利亚的克里·萨克斯比八日在悉尼打破了女子三千米竞走世界纪录。
    新纪录为十二分十三秒七五，比三年前由她创下、并一直保持的原纪录，快了零点七三秒。
    萨克斯比曾十七次打破竞走世界纪录。两周前，她刚刚刷新过女子一万米竞走的世界纪录。
    昨天的比赛在强风中进行，这给创造好成绩造成了困难。萨克斯比赛后对记者说，苏联、中国等好手参加比赛，有利她在恶劣的气候下创造世界纪录。
    萨克斯比的下一个目标是参加下月在匈牙利布达佩斯举行的世界室内田径锦标赛。
