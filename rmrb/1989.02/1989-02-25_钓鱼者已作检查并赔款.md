Last December 7, the fifth edition of your newspaper published a letter from a reader titled "Fishermen Reap a Bountiful Harvest, Fish Farmers Smile Wryly." Following this, the county committee and county government leaders instructed our bureau to conduct an investigation. Upon investigation, it was found that the fishermen were Vice Director of the County Economic Commission, Tang Qimin, and Officer Zhu Xinmin of the Public Security Bureau's Public Order Division.

For this, the county committee and county government decided: Tang Qimin and Zhu Xinmin should make public inspections in their respective units and submit written inspections to the county disciplinary commission and county supervisory bureau. They should compensate for the fish at 75 yuan and apologize to the contractor.

The county committee also issued a notice to all party and government agencies and enterprises in the county, requiring all party members and cadres to learn from this lesson and genuinely strive for clean governance.

　　钓鱼者已作检查并赔款
    去年１２月７日你报第五版刊登了《钓鱼者喜获丰收，养鱼者苦笑相陪》的读者来信后，县委、县政府领导人责成我局进行调查。经查，钓鱼者是县计经委副主任汤启民和县公安局治安股朱信民等人。
    为此，县委、县政府决定：汤启民和朱信民同志在所在单位公开检查，并将书面检查分送县纪委和县监察局；赔偿鱼款７５元，并向承包人赔礼道歉。
    我县县委还向全县党政机关和企事业单位发出通知，要求所有党员干部吸取教训，切实做到为政清廉。
