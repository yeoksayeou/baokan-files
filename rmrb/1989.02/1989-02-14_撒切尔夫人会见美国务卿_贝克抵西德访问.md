British and American officials have agreed to attend the NATO summit scheduled for late May in Brussels, where they will discuss the Western alliance's next phase of strategy towards the Soviet Union.

This decision was made during a meeting between British Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe and newly appointed U.S. Secretary of State James Baker at Howe's residence today. Regarding relations with the Soviet Union, Baker stated that the new U.S. administration believes the Western alliance needs to unite and engage with the Soviet Union in a "prudent and realistic" manner. He said that the U.S. and its allies must continue to extend a hand of friendship to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, but the West must firmly defend its interests, especially in arms negotiations.

British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher met with Baker and had a working lunch with him. Baker described his discussions with British leaders as "very constructive."

On the issue of East-West relations, the governments of Britain and the U.S. agreed that modernizing short-range missiles in Western Europe is important for NATO.

However, it was reported that West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said in an interview with the Financial Times last week that he believes the "real decision" on modernizing short-range missiles should be postponed until 1991 or 1992.

New China News Agency, Bonn, February 12 – U.S. Secretary of State James Baker arrived in Bonn this evening to begin his visit to West Germany.

Baker's visit to Bonn is his first trip to West Germany since assuming the position of Secretary of State.

West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher hosted a dinner for Baker and held a small-scale meeting. According to a U.S. government official, the two sides focused on discussing NATO's arms reduction plan.

The two foreign ministers also discussed the issue of West German companies providing equipment to Libya that can be used to produce chemical weapons. Both sides agreed on strengthening methods to control the export of military materials.

U.S. Secretary of State James Baker will visit Denmark tomorrow and return to Bonn in the late afternoon to meet with West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl. (Accompanying photo)

　　撒切尔夫人会见美国务卿    
    贝克抵西德访问
    本报伦敦２月１２日电  记者陈特安报道：英国和美国已同意出席５月底将在布鲁塞尔举行的北约首脑会议，会议将商讨西方联盟下个阶段的对苏战略。
    这个决定是英国外交大臣杰弗里·豪今天在他的官邸同第一次来访的美国新任国务卿贝克举行的会谈中作出的。在谈到对苏关系时，贝克表示，美国新政府认为，西方联盟需要联合，“慎重而又现实”地同苏联接触。他说，美国及其盟国必须继续向戈尔巴乔夫主席伸出友谊之手，但西方必须坚定维护自己的利益，尤其是在军备谈判方面。
    英国首相撒切尔夫人会见贝克并同他共进工作午餐。贝克说，他同英国领导人的晤谈是“非常建设性的”。
    在东西方关系问题上，英美两国政府一致认为，在西欧推进短程导弹现代化对北约是重要的。
    但据报道，联邦德国总理科尔上周在接受《金融时报》采访时表示，他相信在短程导弹现代化问题上“真正的决定”的作出，应延缓到１９９１年或１９９２年。
    新华社波恩２月１２日电　美国国务卿贝克今天晚上到达波恩开始对西德的访问。
    贝克的波恩之行是他担任国务卿后的首次访问西德。
    西德外长根舍今天设晚宴招待贝克并进行了小范围会谈。据美国政府一位随行官员透露，双方重点讨论了北约裁军方案。
    两国外长还讨论了西德企业向利比亚提供可用于生产化学武器的设备问题。双方在强化军用物资出口管制方法上看法完全一致。
    美国国务卿贝克明天将前往丹麦访问，下午晚些时候再返回波恩与西德总理科尔晤谈。（附图片）
