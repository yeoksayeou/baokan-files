Yuan Geng and the Shekou Experiment
Shekou Special Zone Daily, Chen Yihao

In July 1979, Yuan Geng led a group of pioneers to establish the Shekou Industrial Zone in the Nan Tou Peninsula. This was an experiment in social reform. Here, the proportion of "three types of enterprises" (foreign-funded, jointly-funded, and Chinese-funded) is high, and all enterprise activities are conducted according to economic laws. Yuan Geng believes that a progressive society and a good social environment are the prerequisites for the economic takeoff of any country and nation. Shekou has implemented a series of reform measures to allow people's talents and creativity to be fully utilized.

The Remarkable Orator

On November 12, 1988, the grand South China Hotel in Shekou suddenly became lively. More than 100 foreign and domestic experts and scholars attending the "International Symposium on China's Ten Years of Economic Reform and Prospects" arrived here. When they heard that Yuan Geng, the chairman of the Shekou Industrial Zone, was in the lobby, they all gathered around him, shaking hands, greeting each other, and taking photos, making Yuan Geng busy responding to everyone.

Twenty minutes later, Yuan Geng gave an impromptu speech to the foreign and domestic scholars in the banquet hall. There was no title, no script, and including the time for translation, it lasted only half an hour. However, the atmosphere inside was much more lively and enthusiastic than at a typical reception. Some foreign scholars, without waiting for the translation of his words, were already laughing heartily and applauding enthusiastically. Eight out of ten of them probably understood Chinese. After Yuan Geng finished his speech, some usually dignified scholars became lively. Mr. Jin Yaoru, deputy chairman of the organizing committee of the international symposium, was excited and said, "The most brilliant paper at this symposium is Yuan Geng's speech." Professor Zhu Zizhuang of Princeton University in the United States announced to everyone in both Chinese and English, "After returning to the United States, I will use Yuan Geng's speech as part of my teaching materials!"

It is not enough to simply say that Yuan Geng is a good speaker with infectious enthusiasm to explain the excitement of the experts. I recalled Yuan Geng's speech on another occasion.

It was the end of 1984. The Sanoyo Electric (Shekou) Co., Ltd. was celebrating its first anniversary. The president of Sanoyo Electric Corporation, Mr. Iizuka Kourin, and vice president, Mr. Hage Takeru, led a group of senior employees to cross the ocean and hold a grand banquet at the Teri Village Hotel in Shekou to celebrate the first anniversary of Shekou Sanoyo.

After a few rounds of drinks, the host repeatedly invited Yuan Geng to speak. He could not refuse the hospitality and finally stood up from his seat, holding a glass of wine, and walked to the microphone. His first words were: "More than 40 years ago, Mr. Iizuka Kourin was a member of the invading Japanese army, and I was a soldier in the East River Guerrilla Force in South China. We were in opposing camps, with guns pointed at each other, and we were incompatible like fire and water! More than 40 years later, we are all together today, in a harmonious and friendly atmosphere, toasting to our sincere cooperation! What does this show?"

With few words and a soft voice, he immediately captured the audience's attention. The Japanese friends listened intently, and many of them unconsciously stopped eating. Then Yuan Geng talked about the historical facts of friendly exchanges between the Chinese and Japanese peoples, about the developing economic special zones, and addressed the concerns of foreign investors with the following words: "We attract foreign investors to come here to invest and establish enterprises, of course, we must let them make money and profit. If you lose money here and cannot continue, then the first to fail is not you, but us, the Shekou Industrial Zone! If your enterprise is successful and makes money, then this is not only your success, but also our success!"

Mr. Iizuka Kourin and the Japanese guests were in high spirits, smiling broadly. Wave after wave of enthusiastic applause broke the initial calm atmosphere.

History seems to favor Yuan Geng, and many major events in modern history have involved him. Even those famous political and military figures who have dealt with him probably did not expect that this "colonel" of the South China Guerrilla Force would later become a key figure in China's reform and opening up.

Yuan Geng's experiences are quite legendary.

Yuan Geng is a native of Shenzhen, originally from Da Peng in Bao An. He joined the East River Column led by Zeng Sheng at an early age and served as a capable intelligence officer and liaison officer. After the East River Column retreated north, he followed the troops to join the Third Field Army and participated in the Jinan and Huaihai campaigns under Chen Yi.

In September 1945, after the surrender of the invading Japanese army, Yuan Geng was ordered to negotiate with the British military commander, Major General Summer, in Hong Kong as a colonel of the South China Guerrilla Force. They discussed the withdrawal of the South China Guerrilla Force from Hong Kong and the establishment of an office in Hong Kong.

In October and November 1949, the PLA marched south to eliminate the remnants in Guangdong. Yuan Geng, as the commander of the artillery regiment of the Two-Guang Column of the PLA, led his troops back home.

In 1955, when Premier Zhou Enlai led the Chinese government delegation to Indonesia to attend the Bandung Conference, Yuan Geng was the consul general of the Chinese consulate in Jakarta. During this period, the "Kashmir Princess" incident occurred, and to protect Premier Zhou's safety, Yuan Geng and his colleagues spent many sleepless nights.

During the Cultural Revolution, Yuan Geng was detained in the Qincheng Prison in Beijing for a long time. In late 1978, after experiencing the ups and downs of the military, political, and diplomatic circles for decades, Yuan Geng entered the business and industrial circles at the age of 60 and became the 29th "head" of the Hong Kong branch of the China Merchants' Steam Navigation Company established by Li Hongzhang.

In July 1979, less than a year after Yuan Geng joined the China Merchants' Steam Navigation Company in Hong Kong, he led a group of pioneers to establish the Shekou Industrial Zone at the tip of the Nan Tou Peninsula, facing Hong Kong's Tuen Mun across the sea.

The experimenter's "brilliant paper"

The construction of the Shekou Industrial Zone has entered its tenth year. Looking back at the path taken, what are the feelings of the founder of the Shekou Industrial Zone? His speech, which was praised by foreign and domestic scholars as the "most brilliant paper" at the China Economic Reform Retrospective and Prospects International Symposium, can be said to be a concise summary.

Yuan Geng said: "It is not difficult to transplant and introduce advanced technology and equipment from abroad, but it is difficult to create a social environment that adapts to this openness and economic reform. Progressive people and a good social environment are the prerequisites for any country and nation to take off economically. Without an update of people's ideas, it is very difficult for the social economy to have significant development."

"An enterprise without profit cannot survive for a day. The Shekou Industrial Zone has been operated and developed by an enterprise since the beginning, especially by the China Merchants' Steam Navigation Company, which has grown and developed in Hong Kong for more than 100 years, which has its advantages. The economic structure here is characterized by 'three types of enterprises' accounting for 80%, and all enterprise activities are conducted according to economic laws, so it can adapt to the operation of the market competition mechanism from the beginning."

Regarding the social development that everyone is concerned about, what is Yuan Geng's view? He said: "Social development is to a large extent determined by the creativity and free will of people, and the full play of people's creativity and free will depends on the deepening of social reform. The reform in Shekou is, in essence, an experiment in social reform. In the past ten years, we have taken a series of social reform measures, such as canceling the administrative ranks of cadres, reducing officialdom and privileges; striving for fairness and reasonableness in the distribution of wealth, and determining each person's wage income according to their abilities and contributions; in the housing regulations, everyone is equal, and no one can take advantage of privileges in housing; in political life, transparency is advocated, and privileges are constrained from all aspects. The democratic elections every three years and the annual vote of confidence are powerful constraints on privileges. In addition, public opinion supervision and pressure from mass organizations also play a role in constraining privileges. Within the industrial zone, all employees have the right to reasonable mobility and the right to express their opinions. As long as a person does not intend to overthrow the Communist Party and does not engage in personal attacks, he can freely express his opinions without fear. I can disagree with your views, but I will defend your right to express different opinions to the death. So far, no one in Shekou has been labeled or punished for freely expressing their opinions. All of these are to ensure that people's talents and creativity are fully utilized, making them truly human, not distorted humans!"

Yuan Geng believes that people's right to know is very important. Without people's right to know, there is no transparency in politics. This reminds me of an event that happened two years ago. On September 6, 1986, the cadres of the Shekou Industrial Zone held a unique vote, not to elect who would be the leader, but to freely express their opinions on three investment projects that had not yet been implemented: support or opposition. These three projects were the Shekou Steel Plant, the China Merchants Hotel, and the "Nuwa Mending the Sky" bronze statue. Because these three projects involved large investments and the people of Shekou were discussing them, the leaders of the industrial zone decided to hold a "vote to solicit public opinion." The office sent the relevant materials of these three projects to the cadres of the subordinate units in advance, and before the vote, they told everyone in detail about the preparation of the projects and the feasibility analysis. The result of the vote was that the majority of people supported one project, and the two projects that the masses opposed also played an important role in the leaders' final decision-making.

Yuan Geng does not think that the Shekou Industrial Zone is already very good. He said: "The Pearl River Delta has caught up, and if Shekou stagnates, it will be submerged in a vast wave of industrial development. We must see its shortcomings in its progress and continuously expose its dark side in its brightness." In his speech at the South China Hotel, he said to the foreign and domestic scholars, "If you can point out the dark side of Shekou and point out our shortcomings without hesitation, that would be true friendship!"

No wonder Professor Zhu Zizhuang of Princeton University in the United States gave such an evaluation of Shekou: "From the reform experiment in Shekou, I see the hope of China!"

　　袁庚和蛇口试验
    深圳特区报  陈宜浩
    １９７９年７月，袁庚率一批创业者在南头半岛办起了招商局蛇口工业区。这是社会改革的试验。这里“三资”企业比重大，一切企业行为按经济规律进行。袁庚认为，进步的人，良好的社会环境是任何国家和民族经济起飞的大前提。蛇口采取了一系列改革措施，使人的才能和创造力得到最大限度的发挥。
    　　　　令人叹服的演说家
    １９８８年１１月１２日中午，富丽堂皇的蛇口南海酒店忽然热闹起来，参加“中国十年经济改革回顾与展望国际研讨会”的１００多位中外专家、学者陆续来到这里。当他们听说蛇口工业区董事长袁庚就在大堂时，纷纷朝他围拢过来，握手、寒暄、问候、合影，令袁庚一时应接不暇。
    ２０分钟以后，袁庚在宴会厅即席向中外学者发表演说。没有题目，没有讲稿，连翻译的时间算在内，一共只有半小时。然而场内气氛之热烈，情绪之高涨，远非一般的招待会所能相比。有些外国学者不等翻译把他的话译过来，就已开怀大笑，热烈鼓掌了。八成是他们听得懂汉语。袁庚演讲完毕以后，一些平日端庄矜持的学者变得活动起来。国际研讨会组织委员会副主任金尧如先生情绪激昂地说：“这次研讨会最精彩的论文，就是袁庚先生的这个讲话。”美国普林斯顿大学经济学教授邹至庄先生则用中、英两种语言向大家宣布：“回到美国后，我将引用袁庚先生的演讲来作为我的教材内容！”
    仅仅用“会讲话，有感染力”是难以解释专家们的激动的。我想起了袁庚在另一个场合的另一次讲话。
    那是１９８４年底，三洋电机（蛇口）有限公司成立一周年的时候，日本三洋电机株式会社总裁井植熏、副总裁秃慧猛等带领一批高级职员越洋而来，在蛇口翠亨村酒楼为蛇口三洋公司一周年喜庆摆下了丰盛晚宴。
    酒过三巡，主持人一再请袁庚讲话。他盛情难却，终于起身离座，端着酒杯到麦克风前。他的第一段话是这样说的：“４０多年前，井植熏先生是侵华日军中的一员，我是华南抗日游击队的一名战士，我们处在敌对的阵营，枪口向着对方，水火不能相容！４０多年后的今天，我们都走到一起，在融洽、友好的气氛中，为我们的真诚合作而干杯！这说明了什么？”
    话语不多，声音不大，却一下子就抓住了听众的心。日本朋友一个个凝神谛听，许多人不由自主地停下了筷子。接着袁庚谈到了中日两国人民友好交往的历史事实，谈到了正在发展中的经济特区，并针对外国投资者的担心说了以下一段话：“我们吸引外商来这里投资兴办企业，当然要让他们有钱可赚，有利可图，如果你们在这里办企业亏了本，办不下去，那么失败的首先不是你们，而是我们蛇口工业区！如果你们的企业办得好，赚了钱，那么这不仅是你们的成功，也是我们的成功！”
    井植熏先生和在座的日本人情绪高涨，笑容可掬。一阵又一阵的热烈掌声打破了起初的平淡气氛。
    　　　　历史老人特别钟情于他
    袁庚的经历颇具传奇色彩。
    ——袁庚是地地道道的深圳人，老家在宝安大鹏。他早年即参加以曾生为司令的东江纵队，是一位精干的情报科长和联络处长。东纵北撤后，他随部队编入第三野战军，在陈毅麾下参加过济南战役和淮海战役。
    ——１９４５年９月，侵华日军投降以后，袁庚奉命以华南游击队上校军官的身份，与驻港英军旅长夏悫少将展开谈判，讨论华南抗日游击队撤出香港以及在香港设立办事处等问题。
    ——１９４９年１０月、１１月间，解放军挥师南下，扫除盘踞在广东各地的残敌。袁庚身为中国人民解放军两广纵队炮兵团团长，率领部队打回老家。
    ——１９５５年，周恩来总理率中国政府代表团赴印尼参加万隆会议时，袁庚是中国驻雅加达领事馆总领事。在此期间发生了“克什米尔公主号”事件，为保卫周总理的安全，袁庚和同事们熬过了许多不眠之夜。
    ——文化大革命中，袁庚在北京秦城监狱呆了好一阵子，１９７８年底，袁庚在经历了军界、政界和外交界的几十度春风秋雨以后，以花甲之年进入商界和实业界，成为李鸿章办的香港招商局的第２９代“掌门人”。
    １９７９年７月，袁庚到香港招商局不到一年，便杀出一个厉害的“回马枪”——率一批创业者踏浪而来，在香港屯门隔海相望的南头半岛前端，办起了招商局蛇口工业区。
    历史老人似乎特别钟情于袁庚，许多现代史上的重大事件都让他碰上了。就是那些曾同他打过交道的著名政界军界人物，恐怕也没有预料到，这位华南游击队的“上校军官”，后来会成为中国开放改革的风云人物吧？
    　　　　试验者的“精彩论文”
    蛇口工业区的建设已经进入了第十个年头。回顾过去所走过的路，这位蛇口工业区的创办人到底有些什么感受？他在中国经济改革回顾与展望国际研讨会上被中外学者誉为“最精彩的论文”的演讲，可说是一个精辟的概括。
    袁庚说：“要移植、引进外国的先进技术和先进设备并不困难，难的是要创造一个什么样的社会环境，来适应这种对外开放和经济改革。进步的人，良好的社会环境是任何国家和民族经济起飞的大前提。没有一个人们观念的更新，社会经济要有巨大发展是非常困难的。”
    “一个企业如果没有利润，它一天也活不下去。蛇口工业区从一开始就由一个企业来经营开发，特别是由一个在香港成长、发展了１００多年的招商局来经营开发，有其一定的好处。这里经济结构的特点是‘三资’企业占８０％，一切企业行为均按经济规律进行，所以它从一开始就能适应市场竞争机制的运作。”
    对人们普遍关注的社会发展，袁庚是怎么看的呢？他说：“社会发展在很大程度上决定于人的创造力和自由意志的发挥，而人的创造力和自由意志的充分发挥，则有赖于深化社会改革。蛇口的改革，从本质上说就是社会改革的试验。近十年来，我们采取了一系列社会改革的措施，如取消干部的行政级别，淡化官本位和特权；财富的分配力求做到公平和合理，每个人的工资收入根据他的才能和贡献来决定；在住房条例面前人人平等，任何人不得利用特权在住房上占便宜；在政治生活中提倡有透明度，提倡从各个方面制约特权。每三年一次的民主选举，一年一度的信任投票，就是对特权的有力制约。除此以外，社会舆论的监督，群众团体的压力，也同时对特权发挥制约作用。在工业区内，全体职工有合理流动的权利，有自己发表意见的权利。任何一个人，只要他不是想推翻共产党，不是进行人身攻击，他就可以自由发表意见而免于恐惧。我可以不同意你的观点，但我誓死捍卫你发表不同意见的权利，到目前为止，蛇口没有一个人因为自由发表意见而被戴上帽子或受到处分。所有这些，都是为了使人的才能和创造力得到最大限度的发挥。使之成为真正的人，而不是被扭曲的人！”
    袁庚认为，人们的知情权很重要，没有人们的知情权，政治上的透明度便无从说起。这使我联想起两年前的一件事。１９８６年９月６日，蛇口工业区的干部进行了一次别开生面的投票，不是选举谁当领导人，而是对三个还未上马的投资项目自由发表意见：赞成或反对。这三个项目是蛇口钢厂、招商宾馆和“女娲补天”铜像。由于这三个项目投资较大，而蛇口人又议论纷纷，工业区领导人便决定来个“投票征求民意”。办公室事先把这三个项目有关资料发给直属单位的干部，投票前又把项目准备情况和可行性分析原原本本的告诉大家。投票的结果，大多数人对一个项目表示赞成，群众反对的两个项目，也为领导人最后作出决策起了重要的参考作用。
    袁庚并不认为蛇口工业区已经好到哪里去了。他说：“珠江三角洲已经追了上来，蛇口如果停滞不前，将会淹没在一个大面积的蓬勃发展的工业浪潮中。我们要在前进中看出它的退步，在光明中不断揭露它的阴暗面”。他在南海酒店演讲时对中外学者说：“诸位如果能不客气地指出蛇口的阴暗面，指出我们的缺点，那才是真正的够朋友！”
    难怪美国普林斯顿大学邹至庄教授对蛇口作出这样的评价：“从蛇口的改革试验中，我看到了中国的希望！”
