The real estate exchange in Bengbu, Anhui Province, had a prosperous opening this year. The first transaction was on January 3, when the housing property unit sold a set of public housing to the recently retired former deputy director of the Bengbu Municipal People's Congress, Yu Fu Ying, on the principles of fairness and reasonableness.

Yu Fu Ying is nearly seventy years old. She is from Lian Water County, Jiangsu Province. She joined the army in 1941. She has been in politics with integrity and lives a simple life. She has a lot of influence in Bengbu, and people affectionately call her "Yu Da Jie."

Although she is old, she has a strong sense of reform. When the city promoted the idea of "individual housing, individual purchase," she held several family meetings to discuss whether to buy a house. Initially, someone advised her, "You and your husband are both retired cadres. Why bother spending money to buy the public housing you are already living in?" However, Yu Da Jie clearly saw that the city's housing reform had been going on for more than a year, with over 2,000 units of housing already purchased by individuals, but no one among the municipal and provincial leaders had bought a house. She felt she should take the lead. After discussing with her husband, daughter, and daughter-in-law, she decided that this lead should be taken. She then submitted a house purchase application to the housing property unit. The real estate exchange valuation personnel went to her home for a thorough inspection and appraisal, determining the house price. They said: If the full payment for the house could be made at once, a certain discount could be given according to the regulations.

On January 3, Yu Da Jie gathered all the family's financial resources and borrowed a little from relatives and friends to pay the full price of 12,200 yuan for the three-bedroom, one-living-room public housing she had been living in. She became the first municipal and provincial leader in Bengbu, and even in the entire province of Anhui, to buy her own housing under the policy of "individual housing, individual purchase." Recently, the director of the Municipal Housing Reform Office, Huang Si Gui, told the reporter: Eating from the big pot and living in big public housing—this burden on the state will only become heavier if not thoroughly put down, like carrying straw in the rain. This time, Yu Da Jie took the lead, which will be a profound push for the commodification of housing in the entire city. This lead is taken very well.

　　尤大姐买房
    本报记者  张振国
    安徽省蚌埠市房地产交易所今年开张大吉。第一笔交易，就是１月３日促成房屋产权单位，在公平合理的原则下，卖给刚离休不久的原市人大副主任尤福英一套自住公房。
    尤福英，年近古稀。江苏涟水县人。１９４１年入伍。她从政清廉，生活简朴，在蚌埠很有威望，人们都亲切地称她“尤大姐”。
    她年岁虽大，但改革意识很强。市里搞房改，提倡“个人住房个人买”，她就多次召开家庭会议，商量要不要买房。起先有人劝他：“您老俩口都是离休老干部，花钱去买自己早已住下的公房，何苦呢！”可是，尤大姐清楚地看到：全市房改已搞了一年多，个人买房已有２０００多套，但地、市级领导干部尚无一人买房，自己应该带头。她和丈夫、女儿、女婿等家人多次商量后，觉得这个头还是应该带。于是，她就向房屋产权单位递交了买房申请书。市房产交易所估价人员到她家认真地作了勘测和评估，确定了房价。并说：如果能一次交清房款，还可按规定给予一定的优惠。
    元月３日，尤大姐集中了全家财力，并向亲友借助了一点，一次按价付清１２２００元房款，购得这套自己早已居住的３室１厅的公房。她，光荣地成为蚌埠，乃至安徽全省“个人住房个人买”的第一位地市级领导干部。市房改办主任黄思贵日前告诉记者：吃大锅饭，住大公房——这个背在国家身上的包袱如不彻底放下，就会像雨天背稻草似的，将是越背越重。这回尤大姐一带头，对全市住宅商品化将是一个深层次的巨大推动。这个头带得太好了。
