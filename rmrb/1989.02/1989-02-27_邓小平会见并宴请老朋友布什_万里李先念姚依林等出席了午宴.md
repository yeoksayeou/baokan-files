Central Military Commission Chairman Deng Xiaoping this morning at the Great Hall of the People met with U.S. President Bush. Deng pointed out that China having a stable environment is very important. Without a stable domestic environment, it is difficult to achieve success, and already achieved successes can be lost. He hoped that foreign friends would understand this.

Deng said, China formulates its domestic and foreign policies and makes strategic decisions based on its fundamental interests. We do not play any cards, nor do we resort to expedient measures.

When talking about Sino-U.S. bilateral relations, Deng said that over the past 10 years, the development of relations between China and the United States has been stable, although there are some problems. We hope that during President Bush's term, the friendly cooperative relations between China and the United States can be further developed.

Deng also said that we hope to normalize relations with the Soviet Union and hope that Gorbachev's reforms will succeed. We also hope that the United States and the Soviet Union will improve their relations. Deng welcomed the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty signed by the U.S. and the Soviet Union and hoped that the strategic nuclear weapons talks between the two countries would also make progress.

President Bush said that he came to visit China at a time of significant global changes and many opportunities and challenges, which is very meaningful. He fully agreed with Deng's views on the two countries' relations.

Bush also said that the development of Sino-U.S. relations has great potential. In the United States, support for developing Sino-U.S. relations has never been as strong as it is now.

During the meeting, Politburo Standing Committee member Li Xiannian was present. After the meeting, Deng hosted a luncheon for President Bush and his wife and other American guests. Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Wan Li, Li Xiannian and his wife Lin Jiaxiu, Vice Premier Yao Yilin, Wu Xueqian, and others also attended the luncheon.
