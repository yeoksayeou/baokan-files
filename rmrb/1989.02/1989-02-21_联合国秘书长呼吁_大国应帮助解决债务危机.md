The UN Secretary-General today called on the United States and other industrialized nations to play a role in helping Third World countries overcome their debt crisis.

The Secretary-General made these remarks at the opening ceremony of a three-day international development conference. He said that the debt crisis in the Third World is more severe than the Great Depression of the 1930s. Currently, the per capita income in Latin American countries is lower than it was in the early 1980s; the living standards in African countries are very low; and 800 million people in the Third World are suffering from hunger.

Perez de Cuellar pointed out that the facts show that debtor and creditor countries need to take joint action and formulate long-term and development-friendly measures to solve the debt problem.

　　联合国秘书长呼吁
    大国应帮助解决债务危机
    新华社联合国２月２０日电  联合国秘书长佩雷斯·德奎利亚尔今天呼吁美国和其他工业大国在帮助第三世界国家摆脱债务危机方面发挥作用。
    这位秘书长在为期３天的国际发展会议开幕式上说，第三世界的债务危机比３０年代的萧条时期还要严重。目前，拉丁美洲国家的人均收入低于８０年代初期；非洲国家的生活水平很低；第三世界国家有８亿人在忍饥挨饿。
    佩雷斯·德奎利亚尔指出，事实表明，债务国和债权国需要共同采取行动，制定出长期和有利于发展的解决债务问题的措施。
