	The Kidnapping of an Eight-Year-Old Boy
	Not long ago, an eight-year-old boy named Dennis from Bremen, West Germany, was kidnapped by a criminal and kept in a wooden box for 13 days before finally being rescued.

	Dennis was kidnapped on his way to school. When he was about to reach the school gate, the criminal, Markus, abducted him and took him to a secluded village near the Franco-German border. There, the kidnapper forced Dennis to write a letter to his family demanding a ransom. He gave Dennis sleeping pills and then stuffed him into a narrow wooden box resembling a torture device. Dennis could only curl up his body, with his head hanging down and his chin pressed against his chest. To eat and use the bathroom, Markus would only let him out once a day, after which he would give him more sleeping pills and lock him back into the box.

	Markus demanded $550,000 from Dennis's parents. The police tried to apprehend him, but their first two attempts failed. On the 13th day after the incident, Markus went to collect the third installment of the ransom and was captured by the police. When the police arrived at the place where Dennis was being held, he had not had a drop of water for two whole days. The narrow wooden box had almost become his coffin. Little Dennis said that during the days he was kidnapped, he thought his mother loved him so much that she would definitely find a way to save him. So when Dennis was rescued and saw his mother, he was overwhelmed with joy and tears streamed down his face.

　　八岁孩童遭绑记
    前不久，联邦德国不来梅市年仅８岁的丹尼士惨遭歹徒绑架，被关在一只木箱内长达１３天之久，最后终于获救。
    丹尼士是在上学途中被绑架的。那天当他快到校门口时，歹徒马求斯将他劫持，并把他运到靠近法德边境的一个僻静村庄。在那里，绑架者威逼丹尼士向家里写信索要赎金，给他服用安眠药，然后将他塞入一只酷似刑具的狭小木箱内，丹尼士只能身体屈曲，头部下垂，下颌紧贴着胸腔。为了进食和大小便，马求斯每天只放他出来一次，之后又给他服安眠药，再将他锁入木箱内。
    马求斯向丹尼士的父母索要５５万美元赎金。警方设法缉拿他，但起初两次努力均告失败。事发后第１３天，马求斯应约前去领取第三笔赎金，被警察生擒。当警察赶到丹尼士被困的地方时，他已经整整两天滴水未进了，那只狭小的木箱险些成了他葬身的棺材。小丹尼士说，在他被绑架的那些日子里，他想妈妈平时这样爱他，一定会设法来救他。所以当丹尼士获救后见到自己的母亲时，不禁惊喜交加，泪如泉涌。
