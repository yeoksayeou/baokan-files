The spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said China hopes the Jakarta meeting will aid in the political resolution of the Cambodian issue.

New China News Agency, Beijing, February 2nd – (Reporters: Jiāng Lǔróng, Wáng Shìlóng) Today in the afternoon, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lǐ Zhāoxīng stated at a press conference that the representatives of the three factions of the Democratic Kampuchea have decided to participate in the second informal Jakarta meeting on the Cambodian issue scheduled for later this month. This demonstrates the three factions' positive attitude towards politically resolving the Cambodian issue.

He made these remarks in response to a Vietnamese journalist's question.

Lǐ Zhāoxīng reiterated that China supports all efforts aimed at a fair and reasonable resolution of the Cambodian issue. China hopes that the second Jakarta meeting will make progress in this regard.

　　外交部发言人说
    中国希望雅加达会议有助于政治解决柬问题
    新华社北京２月２日电  （记者姜鲁榕、王士龙）中国外交部发言人李肇星今天下午在新闻发布会上说，民柬三方的代表决定参加这个月晚些时候召开的关于柬埔寨问题的第二次雅加达非正式会议，这表明了民柬三方对政治解决柬埔寨问题所采取的“积极态度”。
    他是在回答越南记者提出的有关问题时说这番话的。
    李肇星重申，中国支持一切有利于公正合理地解决柬埔寨问题的努力。中国希望第二次雅加达会议能够在这方面取得进展。
    他告诉记者，中国没有接到参加雅加达会议的邀请，也没有考虑这方面的问题。
    当问到来访的苏联外长爱·阿·谢瓦尔德纳泽是否会同正在北京的西哈努克亲王会晤时，李肇星说，中国认为，为了推动公正合理地政治解决柬埔寨问题，苏联和越南方面应该同西哈努克亲王去谈。但他没有直接回答西哈努克亲王和谢瓦尔德纳泽这次在北京是否见面。
    在回答有关柬埔寨的问题时，李肇星一再强调越南必须真正地、尽快地从柬埔寨全部撤军，并且越南撤军应该在“有效的国际监督下”进行。
