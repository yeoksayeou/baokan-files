Shijiazhuang Implements Social Pooling of Medical Expenses
Medical Expenses for Retired Workers Managed by Insurance Institutions

	The issue of reimbursing medical expenses for retired workers, which has long troubled many factory directors and managers, has been effectively addressed in Shijiazhuang, Hebei. A reform involving social pooling has not only ensured normal treatment for retired workers but also lifted a heavy burden from enterprises, significantly reducing medical expenses.

	It is understood that the social pooling of medical expenses in Shijiazhuang began in 1986 and is currently limited to retired workers from state-owned enterprises. The pooling is calculated on a county (city) basis, following the principle of "collection based on expenditure, with a slight surplus." The amount of pooled funds is determined by the number of retired workers, the level of medical expense payments, and various hospital-related factors. Generally, it is controlled within 3%-5% of the total wage of workers. The pooled funds are managed by the social insurance department, which sets up separate accounts and uses them uniformly. To facilitate management, each county has established a dedicated institution in the county seat to handle the treatment, health check-ups, mobile medical services, approval of transfers, purchase of medicines, and auditing of medical expense reimbursements for retired workers. In addition, assistants are hired in townships to manage the payment of wages and reimbursement of medical expenses for retired workers living in rural areas.

	The medical security system established after the implementation of medical expense pooling has effectively plugged the loopholes of "one person with public medical benefits, the whole family taking medicine," thanks to the unified management of funds, medical services, and medicines. According to statistics from various counties (cities), medical expenses for retired workers have decreased by 42.8%-74.7% compared to before the pooling, saving 1 million yuan in expenses for the entire region last year. The pooling also ensures that retired workers from loss-making or marginally profitable enterprises no longer worry about reimbursing medical expenses. Doctors from the outpatient departments for retired workers in various counties (cities) regularly provide mobile medical services, delivering medical care and medicines to the doorstep, which is well-received by retired workers.

	The enterprises benefit the most from the implementation of medical expense pooling. The payment of wages and reimbursement of medical expenses for retired workers are handled by social insurance institutions, reducing the enterprises' concerns and allowing factory directors and managers to focus more on production. Guo Lili, the director of Gaoyi County Machinery Factory, said: "In the past, retired workers would come to the factory every day to get approvals and reimbursements, making it difficult to manage. Now that the burden is lifted, there are fewer trivial matters, and we can devote more time to production."

　　石家庄试行医疗费社会统筹
　　离退休职工医疗费由保险机构统一管理
    本报讯  曾使很多厂长、经理头痛的离退休职工的医疗费报销问题，在河北石家庄地区得到了较好解决。一项实行社会统筹的改革，既保证了离退休职工的正常治疗，又为企业卸下沉重的包袱，医疗费的开支也有大幅度下降。
    据悉，石家庄地区的医疗费统筹始自１９８６年，目前还只限于全民企业的离退休职工。他们以县（市）为核算单位，本着“以支定收、略有节余”的原则，根据企业离退休人数、医疗费支付水平及住院诸多因素，测算提取统筹资金数额，一般掌握在职工工资总额的３％—５％。统筹资金由社会保险部门单独设账，统一使用。为了便于管理，各县都在县城设立了专门机构，负责离退休职工的治疗、体检、巡回医疗，批准转院和外购药品及审核报销医疗费等，还在乡镇聘请协助员，负责管理在农村居住的离退休职工的工资发放、报销药费事务。
    实行医疗费统筹之后建起的医疗保障体系，由于采取管钱、管医、管药相统一的管理制度，有效地堵塞了“一人公费，全家吃药”的浪费漏洞。据各县（市）统计，离退休职工的医疗费比统筹前下降４２．８％—７４．７％，去年全区减少开支１００万元。统筹也使一些亏损或微利企业的离退休职工不再为报销药费而犯愁。各县（市）离退休门诊部的医生坚持定期巡回医疗，送医送药上门，深受离退休职工的欢迎。
    实行医疗费统筹获益最大的还是企业。离退休职工的工资发放、药费报销等都由社会保险机构办理，企业减少了后顾之忧，也使厂长、经理们摆脱了大量事务性工作。高邑县机械厂厂长郭丽振说：过去，离退休职工为批条子，报药费，每天都有人往厂里跑，真感到难以招架。现在包袱一卸，琐碎事减少许多，可以腾出更多时间抓生产了。
