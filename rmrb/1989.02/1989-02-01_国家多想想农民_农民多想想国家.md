According to the deployment of the Party Central Committee, various places in rural areas are utilizing the winter downtime to conduct situation education. Many cadres are going to the farmers to engage in dialogue. From the dialogue between the county committee secretary of Jian County, Shanxi Province, and the farmers, although it was only one instance, the secretary's answers were not necessarily 100% accurate, and the farmers might not fully understand everything, but the dialogue itself makes a big difference. The situation is constantly changing, and situation education must be consistently emphasized. Dialogue is a very good form.

You have your words, and I have mine. Since our words are different, we need dialogue and communication. Currently, the overall situation in rural areas is good. Some farmers are dissatisfied with the low procurement prices for grain and the rapid increase in prices for fertilizers, pesticides, and other items. In some places, there are phenomena of forced grain procurement and issuing IOUs for agricultural products, which make farmers feel disgruntled and full of complaints. Conducting situation education and engaging in dialogue with farmers indeed presents some difficulties. However, the more challenging it is, the more we need to do a good job of situation education. We need to guide people to correctly view the situation, understand the direction, build confidence, and find ways to overcome difficulties and continue to move forward. Practice has shown that using effective forms such as dialogue, through reasoning and guidance, we can fully explain the achievements of reform and development, and also thoroughly discuss the difficulties and problems. We can let farmers talk about their own difficulties and also talk about the state's difficulties, guiding farmers to think about the benefits brought by reform. Farmers will be happy and will also understand the problems that cannot be solved immediately and the state's difficulties. The key is to seek real results with honesty and sincerity. If we only talk about pleasant things, such as "the situation is great," and use a set of clichés; or if we say "there are many problems" in a few words and dismiss them; or if we say "I speak and you listen, and you must understand" and even adopt an attitude of giving a report or lecture, it will not have a good effect.

Based on the experiences of various places, it is beneficial to emphasize the following principle in conducting situation education: the state should think more about farmers, and farmers should think more about the state (broadly speaking, this principle should be followed in all aspects related to the relationship between the state and farmers). To emphasize this principle, we must truly place farmers in a position of equal dialogue; in situation education, we must not only educate farmers but also educate the cadres and relevant personnel at all levels who deal with farmers.

The state should think more about farmers. This is determined by the nature of our country, which is based on the alliance of workers and peasants. Chinese farmers have a good tradition of loving their country and have made many significant contributions to the revolution and construction over a long period. The reforms of the past decade have brought many benefits to farmers, but farmers still face many difficulties. The long-standing urban bias has not been completely overcome, and the phenomenon of over-heated industry and cold agriculture has not been corrected. After 1984, the scissors difference between industrial and agricultural products widened again, and the price surge of industrial products, including agricultural production materials, overshadowed the benefits brought to farmers by the state's increase in procurement prices for agricultural and sideline products. "Now, doing anything is better than farming!" If we do not consider these opinions of the farmers, modernization construction will not be possible, and even the current reforms will be difficult to deepen.

In the eyes of many farmers, the relevant departments of the state and local government officials who deal with farmers are "the state." "The state thinking more about farmers" also means that these personnel should often listen to the voices of farmers, think more about the interests and demands of farmers, and genuinely improve their work, doing more good deeds and practical things for farmers.

Farmers should also think more about the state and the overall situation of reform. The deepening reforms in rural areas today are not like the reforms of the people's commune system in the past, which were a "closed revolution" conducted only within the rural areas. Reforming the circulation system of agricultural products and rationalizing the prices of agricultural products involve the adjustment of the economic interest structure of urban and rural residents, the bearing capacity of the state, enterprises, consumers, and other aspects, and must be done step by step. In recent years, the procurement prices of some agricultural and sideline products have been raised, but the sales prices have not changed much, and the financial burden of state subsidies is heavy. Generally speaking, China is a developing country with a large population, a weak foundation, and poor infrastructure. Currently, we need to manage the food for ten billion people and strive to improve people's lives; we also need to arrange for long-term construction, and every aspect is demanding investment. We cannot afford to neglect any aspect. This year and next year, the state will face the heavy tasks of rectifying the economic environment and economic order. Therefore, many things are not that they should not be done or that they are not willing to be done, but rather that there is a lack of capacity. Especially for reforms that affect the whole body, the state can only proceed with the times, plan step by step, and push forward actively and steadily.

Increasing the contract procurement price of grain is an example. Opening up the market will be beneficial for increasing farmers' income from grain production and developing grain production. However, the state's financial capacity and the urban residents' bearing capacity currently cannot achieve complete market regulation of grain. Therefore, although the government knows that the grain procurement price is too low and farmers are at a loss, and they want to change this situation as soon as possible, they have been working towards this goal in recent years. However, considering the overall situation, it is not allowed to increase the price of grain too much, so farmers are still required to understand the state's difficulties and be patient for a while. The difficulties and problems encountered in the reform reflect the complexity and arduousness of the reform. This is not surprising. In situation education, we must use lively, vivid, and practical methods to tell farmers the truth and reveal the bottom line, so that farmers can see the benefits of reform while also seeing the difficulties and necessary sacrifices of reform. In short, through education, we must enable farmers to understand the state's difficulties, think more about the overall situation and the overall interests, and happily invest in rural reform and development, especially this year's agricultural production, to strive for a good harvest this year.

　　国家多想想农民　农民多想想国家
    本报评论员
    根据党中央部署，各地农村正在利用冬闲开展形势教育。许多干部走到农民中去对话。从山西省绛县县委书记与农民的对话来看，虽只一次，书记解答也未必百分之百地准确，农民也不见得一说全通，但对对话就是大不一样。形势常新，形势教育要常抓。对话是一种很好的形式。
    你有你的话，我有我的话。话与话不一样，便需要对话，需要沟通。当前农村形势总的说是好的。一些农民对定购粮价格低而化肥、农药等涨价过猛，有些地方强制收粮，“打白条”收农产品等现象不满意，因而气不大顺，一肚子牢骚话。开展形势教育，同农民对话，确实有一定难度。不过，越是这样，越得搞好形势教育。引导人们正确地看形势，认方向，树信心，找到克服困难、继续前进的办法。实践说明，运用对话等有效的形式，通过说理、疏导，既把改革、发展的成绩说够，又把困难与问题说透；既让农民说说自己的难处，又说说国家的难处，引导农民想想改革带来的好处，农民是会高兴的，对一时解决不了的问题和国家的难处也是会理解的。关键是要以实话实情求实效。光讲好听的，“形势大好”，一二三四一大套；“问题不少”，三言五语说没了；或者“我说你来听，听了就得通”，甚至摆出个架子作报告、训话，就不会有好效果。
    根据各地的经验，当前开展形势教育，突出这样一个原则很有好处：国家多想想农民，农民多想想国家（广而言之，在涉及国家与农民关系的一切方面都要贯彻这个原则）。要突出这个原则，就要真正把农民放在平等对话的位置上；在形势教育中就不仅要使农民受到教育，也要使同农民打交道的各级领导干部和有关部门人员受到教育。
    国家要多想想农民。这是由我们这个以工农联盟为基础的国家的性质所决定的。我国农民有热爱祖国的好传统，长期以来为革命和建设作出了许多重大的贡献。近十年的改革已经给农民带来很多好处，但农民也还存在许多难处。长期以来普遍存在的“城市倾向”还没有完全得到克服，工业过热和农业偏冷的现象还没有得到纠正。１９８４年以后，工农业产品剪刀差重新拉大，包括农业生产资料在内的工业品涨价浪潮，盖过了国家提高农副产品收购价格给农民带来的好处。“如今干什么也比种田强！”不想想农民的这些意见，现代化建设固然不可能，连当前的改革也很难深入下去。
    在许多农民眼里，同农民打交道的国家有关部门、地方政府工作人员就是“国家”。“国家多想想农民”也意味着要求这些人员经常倾听农民的呼声，多想想农民的利益与要求，切实改进工作，为农民多办好事、实事。
    农民也要多想想国家，多想想改革大局。当前农村的深入改革，不像当年改革人民公社体制搞“大包干”那样，只是在农村范围内进行的一次“封闭的革命”。改革农产品流通体制，理顺农产品价格，都涉及城乡居民经济利益结构的调整，涉及国家、企业、消费者等各方面的承受能力，都要一步一步地来。近些年来部分农副产品收购价格提高了，销售价格变化不大，国家财政补贴的负担很重。总的看来，我国是个发展中的大国，底子薄，基础差，当前既要管十亿人的吃饭，致力于改善人民生活；又要安排长远建设，方方面面都张着口要投入，哪方面顾不到都不行。今年明年国家又面临着治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序的繁重任务。因此，许多事不是不该办，也不是不想办，而是心有余力不足。特别是牵一发而动全身的改革，国家只能审时度势，有计划、分步骤、积极稳妥地推进。
    提高粮食合同定购价格就是这样。放开市场，对增加农民种粮收入，发展粮食生产会有好处。但国家的财力和城市居民的承受能力目前还不能做到粮食完全靠市场调节。所以，尽管政府知道粮食定购价偏低，农民吃亏，并且想尽快改变这种状况，近几年来也一直在朝着这个方向努力，但考虑到大局不允许粮食提价幅度过大，所以还是要求农民体谅国家的困难，再耐心等一段时间。改革中遇到这一类困难和问题，反映了改革的复杂性、艰巨性，这并不奇怪。在形势教育中，一定要通过生动、活泼、实实在在的方法，向农民说实话，交实底，使农民在看到改革的好处时，同时看到改革的困难与必须付出的代价。总之，要通过教育达到使农民能体谅到国家的困难，多想大局，多想整体利益，心情舒畅地投入农村改革与发展，特别是今年的农业生产，以争取今年有一个好的收成。
