    "Any county or district with school buildings in danger that cannot be resolved this year will not be allowed to build office buildings or dormitories, and even more will not be allowed to buy cars." This is a regulation announced by Luoyang City Acting Mayor Han Xiying during an inspection of primary and secondary school dangerous buildings at the beginning of the new year.

    On January 19 and 21, Han Xiying led a team to inspect four primary and secondary schools in the old city area of Luoyang and Xinan County, walking on the muddy roads after snow. When he saw students still studying in classrooms with cracks in the walls, Han Xiying said, "Seeing this makes one feel heartbroken and even more uneasy."

    It is understood that the Luoyang City Government has decided that, in addition to allocating 1 million yuan from the city construction maintenance fund each year to solve the problem of school dangerous buildings, another 1.5 million yuan will be allocated this year specifically for solving the problem of school dangerous buildings. Currently, Luoyang City has 9 counties and 6 districts, with an additional 60,000 square meters of dangerous buildings added this year. The Luoyang City Education Department is also preparing to speed up the renovation of dangerous buildings through various channels to raise funds for education.

　　未解决危险校舍的县区不准盖楼买车
　  洛阳市加快学校危房改造
    新华社郑州２月９日电  （记者王耕）“哪个县、区的学校有危房而不能在今年解决，就不准盖办公楼、宿舍楼，更不准买小汽车。”这是新年伊始洛阳市代市长韩西英在察看中小学危房时宣布的一项规定。
    １月１９日和２１日，韩西英带队踏着雪后泥泞的道路，察看了洛阳市老城区和新安县的４所中小学。当看到学生还在墙上裂着缝的教室里上课，韩西英说，看到这些让人感到痛心，更感到不安。
    据悉，洛阳市政府已决定，除每年从城建维护费中拨款百万元解决学校危房外，今年再拨出１５０万元专款用于解决学校危房。目前，洛阳市９县６区加上今年新增危房有６万平方米，洛阳市教育部门还准备通过多渠道筹资办学的办法，加快危房改造的进度。
