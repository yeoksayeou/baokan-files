As the New Year approaches, the State Science and Technology Commission and the State Council's Leading Group for Economic Development in Poor Areas sent a letter to the scientific research institutions, colleges and universities, and scientific and technological personnel working on the frontlines of science and technology poverty alleviation, expressing their heartfelt greetings.

Since the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council decided to develop the economy in poor areas, a large number of scientific and technological workers, with a strong sense of historical mission and responsibility, have, through various forms and methods, brought modern, advanced, and applicable science and technology to the people in the old, remote, border, and poor regions. They have made significant contributions to the economic development and social progress of poor areas, as well as to solving the problem of food and clothing for the people in these areas and helping them to become prosperous.

The letter pointed out that science and technology poverty alleviation is an important part of science and technology serving the main battlefield of economic construction. Over the past few years, the practice of science and technology poverty alleviation has fully proven that the fundamental way for poor areas to become prosperous lies in developing a commodity economy with science and technology as the pillar. Currently, the economic development of poor areas has achieved gratifying results, but the work ahead is still arduous and challenging. As the economic development of poor areas deepens, it is hoped that more scientific research and teaching institutions and scientific and technological personnel will join the cause of science and technology poverty alleviation. The letter hopes that they will continue to summarize their experiences, strive for further progress, deepen reforms, and more effectively deliver applicable scientific and technological achievements to poor areas. This will help to ultimately eradicate poverty from the Chinese land and pave the way for prosperity.

　　国家科委和国务院贫困地区经济开发领导小组
　　临新春致函第一线  慰问科技扶贫人员
    本报北京２月４日讯  新春来临之际，国家科委、国务院贫困地区经济开发领导小组致函在科技扶贫第一线辛勤工作的各科研单位、大专院校和科技人员，向他们表示衷心的慰问。
    自党中央、国务院决定对贫困地区进行经济开发以来，一大批科技工作者怀着强烈的历史使命感和责任感，通过各种形式和办法，把现代先进、适用的科学技术带给老、少、边、穷地区的人民，对贫困地区的经济发展和社会进步、对解决贫困地区群众的温饱问题和脱贫致富做出了重要贡献。
    慰问信指出，科技扶贫是科技面向经济建设主战场的重要组成部分。几年来，科技扶贫工作的实践充分证明，贫困地区脱贫致富的根本出路在于发展以科技为支柱的商品经济。目前，贫困地区经济开发已经取得可喜的成绩，但是今后的工作还相当繁重和艰巨。随着贫困地区经济开发的深入，希望有更多的科研教学单位和科技人员投身到科技扶贫中来。慰问信希望他们不断总结经验，再接再厉，通过深化改革，把适用的科学技术更加有效地输送到贫困地区，为最终在中国大地上铲除贫穷并走向富裕，做出更大的贡献。
