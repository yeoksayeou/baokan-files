“We’re back!”

— A Sidelight on the Arrival of President Bush and His Wife in Beijing

By Zhang Liang and Ding Gang

President Bush seemed to remember Beijing’s winter as not being so warm. At 25th afternoon on Tiananmen Square, Bush stepped out of his car, shaking hands with passersby on bicycles while saying with a smile, “It’s really warm here.”

President Bush and his wife Barbara arrived at the capital airport at 4:30 PM on the 25th. Vice Premier Wu Xueqian was there to greet them. Subsequently, President Bush and his wife boarded a black stretch Mercedes-Benz and headed to the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse.

At 5:08 PM, when the motorcade reached Tiananmen Square, Bush’s car stopped. President Bush shook hands and greeted the passersby on the familiar square. He pointed to one passerby and said, “I know him.” Then he pointed to another and said, “I know him too.” Turning to the welcoming crowd, he said, “I’m glad to see you all again.” Then, President Bush and his wife, who had rushed over, posed for a photo in front of Tiananmen Gate. Before getting into the car, President Bush stood on the step, one hand on the door, leaning out of the car to wave and greet the people.

At 5:20 PM, President Bush and his wife arrived at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse. Premier Li Peng and his wife Zhu Lin, who were waiting there, walked forward to shake hands and greet them. Li Peng said, “On behalf of Zhao Ziyang, Deng Xiaoping, and Yang Shangkun, I extend a warm welcome to your visit.” President Bush happily said, “We’re back!” In the living room, the Bushes and the Li Pengs, facing the constantly flashing cameras, sipped tea and began a friendly conversation. Premier Li Peng welcomed the Bushes’ visit and recalled the scene of his meeting with Bush during his visit to the United States in 1985. President Bush hoped that Premier Li Peng would visit the United States again. He said, “China has undergone tremendous changes in recent years. I am very interested in coming back to see the new situation.” When talking about his time as the liaison officer in Beijing from 1974 to 1975, Bush smiled and said, “I didn’t think I would become the president at that time.”

Next, the Li Pengs presented gifts to the Bushes: two 26-inch Flying Pigeon brand bicycles, one for a man and one for a woman, each with a backpack with a distinctive national style on the back seat. Mrs. Bush exclaimed, “Ah! These bicycles are so beautiful!” Bush also happily said, “This is a very good gift, I like it.” He then stretched out his leg to step onto the bicycle. Seeing this, Premier Li Peng pointed to the bicycle and said, “The seat seems a bit low, it can be adjusted higher.” Amid laughter, the Bushes’ gifts were also presented to the Li Pengs, which was a pair of black cowboy boots. On the left boot, there was an American flag, and on the right boot, there was a Chinese flag. Li Peng said, “Next time I go to the United States, perhaps I will wear this pair of boots.”

When saying goodbye, the hosts repeatedly reminded the guests to get a good rest, as there would be more intense activities the next day.

　　“我们又回来了！”
     ——布什总统和夫人抵京侧记
    本报记者  张亮  丁刚
    布什总统记忆中的北京的冬天似乎并不这样暖和。２５日下午在天安门广场，布什走下轿车，一边和骑车路过的北京市民握手，一边笑着说：“这里真暖和。”
    布什总统和夫人巴巴拉是２５日下午四点半抵达首都机场的。国务院副总理吴学谦到机场迎接。随后，布什总统和夫人乘坐一辆黑色加长奔驰牌小轿车前往钓鱼台国宾馆。
    五时零八分，当礼宾车队行至天安门广场时，布什总统的轿车停了下来。布什总统在他熟悉的广场上和过路的北京市民一一握手、问好。他指着一位市民说：“我认识他。”又指着另一位市民说：“我也认识他。”转而又向欢迎的人们说：“真高兴能再次见到你们。”随后，布什总统和赶上前来的夫人一道在天安门前合影。在进入轿车前，布什总统脚踩车踏板，一手扶门，探身车外向人们挥手致意。
    五时二十分，布什总统和夫人抵达钓鱼台国宾馆，迎候在那里的李鹏总理和夫人朱琳走上前去握手问候。李鹏说：“我代表赵紫阳、邓小平、杨尚昆对阁下的来访表示热烈欢迎。”布什总统高兴地说：“我们又回来了！”在客厅里，布什夫妇和李鹏夫妇面对闪烁不停的闪光灯，一边喝茶，一边开始了友好的交谈。李鹏总理对布什夫妇的来访表示了欢迎，并且回顾了１９８５年他访美时与布什会见的情景。布什总统希望李鹏总理以后再次访美。他说：“中国近几年发生了巨大的变化，我很有兴趣回来看看，了解新的情况。”在谈到他１９７４年至１９７５年在北京担任联络处主任时，布什笑着说：“那时我也没想到能当总统。”
    接着，李鹏夫妇向布什夫妇赠送了礼品：两辆２６英寸飞鸽牌自行车，一辆男车，一辆女车，每辆车的后座上都夹着一个富有民族风格的背包。布什夫人赞叹道：“啊！这车子真漂亮！”布什也高兴地说：“这是很好的礼品，我喜欢它。”说着就伸出腿去跨上了车子，李鹏总理看到后，指着车子说：“这车座好像低了点，可以调高一些。”笑声中，布什夫妇的礼品也送到了李鹏夫妇面前，这是一双黑色的牛仔靴，左靴筒上有一面美国国旗，右靴筒上有一面中国国旗。李鹏说：“下次到美国去，或许我会穿上这双靴子。”
    握别时，主人一再叮嘱客人要好好休息，因为明天将有更为紧张的活动。
