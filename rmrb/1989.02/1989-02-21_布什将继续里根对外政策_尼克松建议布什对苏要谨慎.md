Bush to Continue Reagan's Foreign Policy
Nixon Advises Bush to Be Cautious with the Soviet Union

	New York Times, February 19, Washington — U.S. Secretary of State James Baker today stated that the Bush administration will continue the foreign policy of President Reagan.

	In an interview with NBC reporters, Baker said, “There is not much difference between the foreign policies of the two administrations,” “The main foreign policy guidelines of the Reagan cabinet will continue.”

	Regarding U.S. policy towards Central America, Baker said, although the five presidents of Central America agreed on February 14 to dismantle the anti-government bases of the Nicaraguan rebels in Honduras in exchange for democratic reforms in Nicaragua, President Bush will still seek new aid for the Nicaraguan rebels, “at least humanitarian aid.”

	On the issue of Afghanistan, Baker pointed out that although the Soviet Union has completely withdrawn from Afghanistan, the United States will continue to support the resistance forces. He explained that since the Soviet Union has left a large amount of equipment to the Kabul government, “We need to support the guerrillas as much as possible.”

	Regarding the Middle East issue, Baker said the United States will continue to engage in dialogue with the Palestine Liberation Organization.

	New York Times, February 19, Washington — Former U.S. President Richard Nixon recently wrote a lengthy article urging President Bush to be cautious in dealing with Soviet leaders.

	Nixon wrote in a recent issue of Foreign Affairs magazine that the abilities of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev “can make the world both safer and more dangerous.”

	He said that when the West reassesses its policy towards the Soviet Union, it must remember that “the roots of the Cold War, namely the Soviet domination of Eastern Europe and its aggressive foreign policy, still exist.” The slogan “The Cold War is over” will make people pay less attention to the security of the West.

	This former president, who has dealt with several Soviet leaders, proposed a series of suggestions to Bush in a 20-page article, including consulting with Western allies on military and trade policies with the Soviet Union before holding a summit with Soviet leaders, continuing the deployment of U.S. intercontinental ballistic missiles, and continuing aid to Afghan and Nicaraguan guerrillas.

　　布什将继续里根对外政策
    尼克松建议布什对苏要谨慎
    新华社华盛顿２月１９日电  美国务卿贝克今天表示布什政府将继续里根总统的对外政策。
    在接受全国广播公司记者采访时，贝克说：“两届政府的对外政策无多大区别”，“里根内阁的主要（对外）方针政策将继续下去”。
    关于美国对中美洲政策，贝克说，虽然中美洲五国总统在２月１４日的和平协议中打算撤除尼加拉瓜反政府武装在洪都拉斯的军事基地，以换取尼加拉瓜的民主改革，布什总统还将为尼反政府武装争取新的援助，“起码是人道主义的援助”。
    在谈到阿富汗问题时，贝克指出，虽然苏联已全部撤出阿富汗，但是美国将继续给抵抗力量提供帮助。他解释说，由于苏联留给喀布尔政权大量装备，“我们要尽可能支持游击队”。
    关于中东问题，贝克说美国将继续与巴勒斯坦解放组织进行对话。
    新华社华盛顿２月１９日电　美国前总统尼克松最近撰写长篇文章，敦促布什总统在与苏联领导人打交道时要谨慎从事。
    尼克松在最近一期《外交》季刊上发表的文章中说，苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫的才能“既能使全球变得更加安全，也能使全球变得更加危险”。
    他说，西方在重新估价对苏政策时须记住，“冷战的根源，即苏联主宰东欧及其侵略性的对外政策，依然存在。”“冷战已经结束”这一口号将使人们不再重视西方的安全问题。
    这位与苏联几任领导人打过交道的前总统在长达２０页的文章中对布什提出了一系列建议，其中包括与苏联举行首脑会谈前应先与西方盟国领导人一起磋商对苏的军备及贸易政策、继续部署美国洲际弹道导弹以及继续援助阿富汗和尼加拉瓜游击队等。
