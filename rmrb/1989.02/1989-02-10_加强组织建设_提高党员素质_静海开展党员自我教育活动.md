Over the past three years, Jingan County in Tianjin City has actively carried out party member self-education activities, eliminating unfavorable factors, strengthening party unity, and further improving the quality of party members and the fighting capacity of party organizations.

After the rectification work was completed, Jingan County seized the opportunity to strengthen the self-education of party members. In 1986 and 1987, the county conducted two major discussions on deepening reforms and revitalizing Jingan. During the discussions, some party members' misunderstandings about reforms and the development of a commodity economy were clarified, and party members were made aware of their important responsibility to lead the masses to prosperity. Everyone actively contributed ideas and strategies, promoting the economic development of their respective units. In 1988, the county committee learned that some party organizations did not implement various systems, and organizational life was not carried out; some party members' revolutionary will had declined, their sense of duty had weakened, they did not participate in organizational activities, and some even complained and spoke ill behind the scenes. The county committee launched an activity in the second half of last year in all grassroots branches, focusing on "learning as the main focus, self-summary as the main focus, self-evaluation as the main focus, and praising good deeds as the main focus." Everyone spoke freely, and the activity was quite enlightening.

	—Strengthened party consciousness. More than 90% of the 19,000-plus party members in the county participated in the self-evaluation activity and recognized to varying degrees the problems they had. They evaluated and criticized themselves, voluntarily proposing measures to overcome their shortcomings and correct their mistakes. Three party members from Erjie in Tangguantun Town said: "In the past, we thought that with the implementation of the household contract responsibility system, everyone did their own thing, and party members and the masses were the same. Party members had nothing to do. Now we realize that as a party member, one must act like a party member and not just differ from non-party members by five fen (referring to party dues)." During the evaluation activity, they established a poverty alleviation and assistance group, determined to help disadvantaged households achieve prosperity.

	—Enhanced the awareness of party members to participate in politics and policy-making. Party members across the county submitted a total of 3,125 rationalization suggestions on party, government, and mass affairs to their branches, and each branch formulated measures to correct and improve these suggestions.

	—Promoted the transformation of backward party members and leadership teams. Through self-evaluation, 64 party members who could not regularly participate in organizational activities and 57 party members who had made various mistakes all recognized their problems according to party member standards and showed significant improvements; 869 branches conducted self-criticism on the party member meetings regarding issues such as economic development, leading the masses to prosperity, and adhering to party life systems, and proposed improvement measures.

	—Enhanced the awareness of strengthening party organization construction. The self-education activity improved the awareness of grassroots party organizations, further improved and perfected the organizational system, and implemented classified guidance. For backward party members and leadership teams, the method of branch and party committee members taking responsibility was adopted to strengthen ideological education, so that backward party members and branches could quickly catch up with the advanced ones.

　　加强组织建设　提高党员素质
　　静海开展党员自我教育活动
    本报讯  记者陈满正报道：３年来，天津市静海县积极开展党员自我教育活动，消除了不利因素，增强了党内团结，使党员素质和党组织战斗力有了进一步提高。
    静海县在整党工作结束后，利用这个有利时机，加强党员的自我教育。１９８６、１９８７两年，该县开展了深化改革、振兴静海两次大讨论。讨论中既澄清了一些党员对改革和发展商品经济的一些糊涂认识，又使党员明确了带领群众致富的重大责任，大家积极献计献策，促进所在单位经济的发展。１９８８年县委了解到，有的党组织各项制度不落实，组织生活开展不起来；有的党员革命意志衰退，事业心淡漠，不参加组织活动，甚至背后发牢骚、说怪话。县委于去年下半年在全县基层支部开展了以“学习为主、自己总结为主、自我评价为主、表扬好人好事为主”的活动。大家畅所欲言，颇有教益。
    ——增强了党员意识。全县１．９万多名党员参加自我评价活动，９０％以上的党员都不同程度地认识到自己存在的问题。他们自我评价、自我批评，自觉地提出克服缺点和改正的措施。唐官屯镇二街３名党员说：“过去我们认为，实行大包干，各干各的，群众党员都一样，党员没有什么事可做了。现在感到作为一个党员就要像个党员的样子，不能党员不党员只差五分钱（指党费）。”在评价活动中，他们成立了扶贫帮困组，决心帮助困难户走上富裕路。
    ——增强了党员参政议政的自觉性。全县党员对支部共提出党、政、群等方面的合理化建议３１２５条，各支部对这些建议都制定了改正和改进措施。
    ——促进了后进党员和班子的转化。通过自我评价，全县有６４名不能经常参加组织活动和５７名犯有这样那样错误的党员，都按党员标准认识自己的问题，并有了明显改正；８６９个支部在党员会上就发展经济、带领群众致富、坚持党的生活制度等方面存在的问题进行了自我批评，提出了改进措施。
    ——加强了党组织建设的自觉性。自我教育活动，提高了基层党组织的认识，进一步健全和完善了组织制度，实行了分类指导。对后进党员和班子，采取支部和党委成员承包的办法，加强思想教育，尽快使后进党员和后进支部跨进先进行列。
