Chile has long been known as the "Copper Nation," and until the mid-1970s, copper accounted for more than 80% of Chile's exports. In recent years, Chile's export structure has undergone significant changes. In 1987, copper production doubled compared to the mid-1970s, but its share of total exports dropped to 42.8%. This is due to Chile's efforts in diversifying its exports, with forestry products emerging as a new star. In 1987, forestry products (logs, lumber, pulp, wood chips) accounted for 11.8% of the total export value.

The southern region of Chile, the Eighth Administrative District, is the most important forestry area. We were invited to visit the Arauco Pulp Company there. Arauco is a comprehensive forestry enterprise that operates plantations, sawmills, and pulp mills. It is one of Chile's largest forestry companies. Driving south from the district capital of Concepción, we gradually entered the forestry area. This is a hilly area at the foot of the Andes, with slopes covered entirely by pine forests. From a distance, it is lush green, and up close, each tree stands tall. The host said, "These are radiata pines (branches grow upwards), originally from California, USA. After being introduced to Chile, they adapted particularly well to the local climate and soil conditions, growing even faster than in their original habitat. They have been chosen as the main species for artificial forests." Chile has 7 million hectares of natural forests, but currently, the focus is on developing artificial forests. In 1974, the government issued a law stipulating that in areas previously without vegetation, afforestation would be subsidized by the government at 75% of the cost, and that natural forests must be replanted in the same year they are harvested. This law greatly encouraged artificial afforestation and also played a role in protecting natural forest resources. Over the past 14 years, artificial forests have increased from 290,000 hectares to 1.1 million hectares, with more than 90% of timber production coming from artificial forests.

The jeep wound its way up the valley along the roads carved into the mountains. On both sides were patches of forest, dense in some areas and sparse in others. The host explained that radiata pines are planted at a density of 1,250 trees per hectare, thinned out every few years, and usually harvested for timber after 20 years when the diameter reaches 45 centimeters, leaving only 250 trees per hectare. The young trees that are thinned out can be used as pulp or chipped (for export to paper mills). Arauco Company has 440,000 hectares of plantations, of which 270,000 hectares are artificial forests. The company places great importance on fire prevention. In the forest area we visited, there were 14 monitoring stations and 14 fire-fighting teams. The fire alert center has a map of the plantation operations, with different colors marking the type of work being carried out in each area. When a fire alarm is received, the center can quickly decide on the appropriate measures.

At the foot of the mountain is the sawmill, one of the three sawmills owned by the company, covering 25 hectares. It processes 3,000 cubic meters of logs per month, producing 1,400 cubic meters of lumber in eight different sizes. The sawmill's production, from debarking and sawing to drying, is fully mechanized, with new equipment, and all products are exported. The company's pulp mill is adjacent to the sawmill, producing 390,000 tons of dry pulp annually. Currently, it is undergoing expansion, and in four years, the annual output will reach 700,000 tons. China is Arauco Company's largest pulp buyer, purchasing approximately 70,000 tons annually.

We also visited the ports of San Vicente and Talcahuano, not far from the forestry area, which are the main ports for exporting Chile's forest products. On the docks, boxes of dry pulp, logs, and various sizes of lumber are neatly arranged, and piles of wood chips and sawdust are stacked high. The labels indicate that these products will be shipped to Japan, China, South Korea, the United States, and even Sweden and Finland. This is a microcosm of the thriving forestry industry in Chile. In 1987, Chile's foreign trade exports grew by 24.4%, with forestry product exports increasing by 61%. Forests are renewable resources, and green gold—forest products—are playing an increasingly important role in exports.

The prosperity of the forestry industry, from one aspect, shows that Chile's efforts to diversify its exports using its own conditions are achieving success.

　　铜矿之国话绿金
　　——智利林业见闻
    本报记者　李志明
    智利一直以“铜矿之国”闻名于世，直到七十年代中期，铜在智利的出口中一直占百分之八十以上。近年来智利的出口结构发生了很大变化。一九八七年铜的产量比七十年代中期翻了一番，但在出口总额中的比重却下降到百分之四十二点八。这要归功于智利在出口多样化方面的努力，而出口产品的新秀当首推林业产品。一九八七年林业产品（原木、木材、纸浆、木片）出口达到出口总值的百分之十一点八。
    智利南部的第八行政大区是最重要的林区。我们应邀参观了那里的阿劳科纸浆公司。阿劳科公司是兼营林场、锯木厂、纸浆厂的综合性林业企业，是智利最大的林业企业之一。出大区首府孔塞普西翁南行，逐渐进入林区。这里是安第斯山麓的丘陵地带，山坡全部为松林覆盖。远看一片葱绿，近看株株挺拔。主人说，这就是辐射松（树枝向上生长），原产美国加利福尼亚，引进到智利后，特别适应这里的气候和土壤条件，生长速度比在原产地还要快，被选为人工林的主要树种。智利有天然林七百万公顷，但目前开发的主要是人工林。一九七四年政府颁布一项法律，规定在原先没有植被的地方造林，政府给予相当于成本百分之七十五的补贴，同时规定开采天然林必须在当年复种。这项法律大大鼓励了人工造林，同时起到了保护天然林资源的作用。十四年来，人工林从二十九万公顷增加到一百一十万公顷，林木生产百分之九十以上来自人工林。
    吉普车沿着山谷中辟出的道路盘旋而上，两边是一片片疏密不一的林木。主人解释说，辐射松每公顷栽一千二百五十株，隔几年间疏一次，一般二十年后直径达到四十五厘米时成材砍伐，这时每公顷只剩二百五十棵。间下来的未成材幼树可做纸浆原料或打成木片（出口造纸用）。阿劳科公司有四十四万公顷林场，其中人工林二十七万多公顷。公司对防火极其重视。在我们参观的那个林区，有十四个监视站和十四个救火队。火情警戒中心有一张林场作业图，上面用各种颜色标出每个区正在进行何种作业，当发生火灾警报时，中心可以据此迅速决定采取何种措施。
    山脚下就是锯木厂，这是公司拥有的三家锯木厂之一，占地二十五公顷。每月加工原木三千立方米，生产八种规格的木材一千四百立方米。锯木厂生产从剥皮、锯刨到烘干，全部机械化，设备很新，产品全部出口。公司纸浆厂就在锯木厂旁边，年产三十九万吨干纸浆，目前正在扩建，四年后年产量可达七十万吨。中国是阿劳科公司纸浆的第一大买主，每年约购买七万吨。
    我们还参观了圣维森特港和塔尔卡华诺港，离林区不远，是智利林产品外运的主要港口。码头上，一箱箱干纸浆、原木、各种规格的木材排列得整整齐齐，木片和木屑堆积如山。标签上标明这些产品将发往日本、中国、南朝鲜、美国，甚至还有瑞典和芬兰。这里是欣欣向荣的智利林业的一个缩影。一九八七年智利外贸出口增长百分之二十四点四，林产品出口则增长了百分之六十一。森林是可再生资源，绿金——林产品在出口中所占位置日益重要。
    林业的繁荣从一个侧面显示，智利利用本国条件实现出口多样化的努力正在取得成功。
