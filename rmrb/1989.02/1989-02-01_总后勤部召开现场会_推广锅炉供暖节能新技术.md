The General Logistics Department held an on-site meeting in Beijing Military Region Logistics Division to promote the new boiler heating energy-saving quantitative management technology.

The new technology was jointly developed by the 251st Hospital and the Hebei Provincial Institute of Building Engineering. It mainly involves installing a microcomputer monitoring device in the boiler heating system. Based on data such as outdoor temperature, circulating water volume, and supply and return water temperatures, the system adjusts the heat balance of the heating system. This reduces heat loss caused by frequent ignition and extinguishing, ensures complete combustion of coal, and allows the boiler to operate at full load and high efficiency, thereby improving heating and saving coal. Trials have shown that this technology can save about 25% of coal. General Logistics Department Director Zhao Nanqi demanded that this technology be promoted throughout the military.

　　总后勤部召开现场会
    推广锅炉供暖节能新技术
    据新华社北京１月３１日电  （通讯员王帅民、记者赵苏）解放军总后勤部昨天在北京军区后勤某分部召开现场会，推广锅炉供暖节能量化管理新技术。
    这项新技术是某分部所属的２５１医院和河北省建工学院合作研究成功的。它主要通过在锅炉供暖系统装设微机监测装置，根据室外温度、循环水量、供回水温度等数据，对供暖系统进行热力平衡的调整，减少因频繁起火压火造成的热量损失，使煤炭得到充分燃烧，锅炉满负荷高效率运转，达到改善供暖和节省煤的目的。经试用证明，采用这项新技术可节煤２５％左右。总后勤部部长赵南起要求在全军推广这项新技术。
