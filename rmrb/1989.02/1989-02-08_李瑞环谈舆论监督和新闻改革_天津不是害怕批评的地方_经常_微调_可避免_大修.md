	Li Ruihuan on Public Opinion Supervision and News Reform
	Tianjin is not a place that fears criticism
	Frequent "micro-adjustments" can avoid "major overhauls"

	BEIJING, Feb. 6 (Xinhua) -- Before the Spring Festival, Tianjin Mayor Li Ruihuan invited reporters from central and other provincial news organizations stationed in Tianjin for a candid discussion on news reform. He believes that strengthening public opinion supervision and making frequent "micro-adjustments" can avoid the need for "major overhauls."

	Li Ruihuan said, "Tianjin's progress is inseparable from the support of news organizations. In the new year, we face many difficulties and new problems. From the central to local leaders, there is not a single day that is easy, and we need the help of news workers more than ever to think ahead and help us overcome these challenges. This help includes public opinion criticism and supervision." He said, "Tianjin is not a place that fears criticism. Criticism must be based on objective facts and must be helpful in overcoming difficulties."

	Li Ruihuan also mentioned that there are many difficult issues currently, and this is a good time to generate new ideas and experiences. He suggested that reporters should report less on leaders and more on the masses. He said, "The mood of the masses should be the first signal for our work. Tianjin's work in recent years has mainly focused on this aspect, and reporters should capture these materials."

	Li Ruihuan specifically mentioned the issue of developing "individuality" in news reporting. He referred to reporters as "information-savvy individuals with unique insights." He said, "Your head should be on your own shoulders. Under the premise of adhering to the four cardinal principles, individuality should be allowed to exist, creativity should be allowed, and diversity should be encouraged."

　　李瑞环谈舆论监督和新闻改革
　　天津不是害怕批评的地方
　  经常“微调”可避免“大修”
    本报天津２月６日电  记者肖荻报道：春节前夕，天津市长李瑞环邀请中央及外地新闻单位驻津记者促膝谈心，纵论新闻改革。他认为，加强舆论监督，经常“微调”，可以避免“大修”。
    李瑞环说，天津的进步与新闻单位的支持分不开。在新的一年，我们面临许多困难和新问题，从中央到地方领导没有一天是轻松的，更需要新闻工作者一起居安思危，尽可能给以帮助。这个帮助就包括舆论批评、舆论监督在内。他说，天津不是害怕批评的地方。批评一要符合客观事实，二要有利于克服困难。
    李瑞环还说，现在有许多难点，正是出思想、出经验的好时候，群众中有许多新鲜的创造。他建议记者少报道领导，多报道群众。他说，群众情绪应作为工作的第一信号。天津这些年的工作主要是在这方面作文章，记者应捕捉这些素材。
    李瑞环专门提到在新闻报道中发展“个性”的问题。他称记者是“信息灵通之人，有独到见解之士”。他说，脑袋要长在自己肩膀上。在坚持四项基本原则前提下，要允许个性存在，允许创造，允许多姿多彩。
