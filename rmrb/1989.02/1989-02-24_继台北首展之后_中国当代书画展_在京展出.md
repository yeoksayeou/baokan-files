	Following its premiere in Taipei, the "Chinese Contemporary Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition" opened in Beijing today. The exhibition, featuring 333 works by mainland, Taiwanese, Hong Kong, and overseas Chinese calligraphers and painters, will run until March 5 at the China Art Museum in Beijing. The exhibition includes 123 works from Taiwan, with almost all renowned Taiwanese calligraphers and painters participating. This exhibition, which premiered in Taipei last November, was warmly received by local audiences and was hailed as a "grand event," providing a sense of "joyful spiritual communication."

	The organizer of the exhibition is Shi Jingyi, chairman of the board of Hong Kong Hanrong Book Company Limited and a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Since 1984, Mr. Shi has organized three large-scale book fairs in Shenzhen, donating over 300,000 books from Hong Kong and Taiwan to numerous libraries, universities, and cultural and academic institutions on the mainland. Following the success of "The Bridge of Books Across the Strait," he conceived the idea of "Uniting the Descendants of the Yellow Emperor Through Art." The Beijing leg of the exhibition received assistance from Peking University. Mr. Shi also plans to hold a mainland book exhibition in Taipei this summer, donating all the exhibition items, approximately 10,000 kinds, to the academic community in Taiwan after the exhibition.

	Song Renqiong, Zhou Guocheng, Fei Xiaotong, Lei Jiequn, Fang Yi, Zhao Puji, and Cheng Siyuan attended the opening ceremony today.

　　继台北首展之后
   “中国当代书画展”在京展出
    本报北京２月２３日讯  记者李彤报道：大陆、台湾、香港和海外华人书画家的丹青墨宝３３３幅，从今天起至３月５日在北京中国美术馆汇聚一堂。展品中包括来自台湾的作品１２３幅，台湾几乎所有著名的书画家均有作品参展。这一“中国当代书画展”已于去年１１月在台北首次展出，受到当地各界的热烈欢迎，被评价为一次“盛会”，令人感受到“心灵沟通的愉快”。继北京之后，这个展览还将在广州、香港、新加坡和马来西亚展出。
    展览的筹办者是全国政协委员、香港汉荣书局有限公司董事长石景宜先生。石先生自１９８４年以来，三次在深圳举办大型港台版图书展销，先后向大陆许多图书馆、高等院校和文化学术机构赠送港台版图书３０多万册。他在“海峡两岸交流书作舟”取得成功之后，又萌“炎黄子孙联谊画为媒”之念。他在北京的展出活动得到了北京大学的协助。石先生还计划于今年夏天在台北举办大陆图书展览，展后将全部展品约１万种赠送给台湾学术界。
    宋任穷、周谷城、费孝通、雷洁琼、方毅、赵朴初、程思远等出席了今天的开幕式。
