	Khomeini's successor criticizes the 10th anniversary of the revolution activities
	Believes it should not just be self-praise and admiration

	Xinhua News Agency, Tehran, February 12th - According to the Iranian newspaper *Jahan-e Islam*, Iran's religious leader Khomeini's legal successor Ali Montazeri on the 11th met with the public in the holy city of Qom. He sharply criticized the 11-day grand celebration of the 10th anniversary of the revolution.

	He said, Iran needs to review the history of the past 10 years, see which mistakes need to be corrected, and think about what to do in the future, rather than just boasting and admiring itself. He said, Iran made many mistakes in the war, shouted many slogans that were known to be unrealistic, and many slogans made the world fear Iran.

	He also said, Iran has had many extreme behaviors in the past 10 years, causing three to four million Iranians to leave their homeland.

	Montazeri called for the construction of an open society that allows freedom of speech.

　　霍梅尼继承人批评革命１０周年活动    
    认为不应只是自我夸耀和赞美
    新华社德黑兰２月１２日电  据伊朗《世界报》报道说，伊朗宗教领袖霍梅尼的法定继承人阿里·蒙塔泽里１１日在圣城库姆接见群众时，尖锐地批评了历时１１天的轰轰烈烈的革命１０周年庆祝活动。
    他说，伊朗需要回顾过去１０年的历史，看看哪些错误需要改正，想想今后应该怎么办，而不应该只是夸耀和赞美自己。他说，伊朗在战争中犯了许多错误，喊了许多明知做不到的口号，许多口号使世界害怕伊朗。
    他还说，伊朗在过去１０年里有许多极端的行为，致使三四百万伊朗人离开了祖国。
    蒙塔泽里呼吁建设一个开放的社会，允许言论自由。
