Open recruitment makes "connections" ineffective

Qiqihar city's direct-hire officials take up their posts

52 recruits mostly from the grassroots

BEIJING — According to a report by Wei Yanan, the first batch of 52 officials, selected through examinations and assessments last year, have recently taken up their posts in the direct-affiliated departments of the Qiqihar Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government.

The lack of transparency in the selection of cadres is a significant reason for the poor quality of cadres, the irrational structure, the phenomenon of too many people doing too little work, and low work efficiency. It has affected the functioning of the leading organs and the deepening of reforms. Therefore, the Qiqihar Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government decided to publicly recruit officials. After the news was announced in May last year, people spread the word, and 499 applicants participated in the examination. After intense competition, the personnel department ultimately selected and appointed 13 section chiefs, 11 division chiefs, and 28 general officials.

Due to the public recruitment, "connections" became ineffective, and backdoor deals were no longer possible. Of the 52 officials, 41 came from the grassroots and took up their posts in party and government organs with their abilities. The half-year probation period has proven that the quality of the recruited officials is good, bringing new vitality to the organs.

Currently, the recruitment of 91 officials in 24 units of the Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government is being prepared.

　　招考一公开  “条子”便失灵
    齐齐哈尔市直应聘干部就职
　  五十二名录用者大都来自基层
    本报讯  记者魏亚南报道：中共黑龙江省齐齐哈尔市委、市政府按照公开、平等、竞争、择优的原则，去年经过考试考核选调的第一批五十二名市委、市政府直属机关干部，最近走上了各自的岗位。
    选拔干部透明度不高是干部素质差、结构不合理、人浮于事、工作效率低的一条重要原因。它已影响了领导机关职能的发挥和改革的深入进行。为此，齐齐哈尔市委、市政府决定公开招聘干部。去年五月消息传开后，人们奔走相告，应试者达到四百九十九人。经过激烈角逐，人事部门最终选调聘任了处长十三名，科长十一名，一般干部二十八名。
    由于公开招聘，“条子”不管用了，后门行不通了，五十二名干部有四十一名来自基层，他们凭本事堂堂正正地走上了党政机关的工作岗位。半年来试用期的工作证明，招聘干部的素质好，已给机关带来了生机与活力。
    目前，市委、市府的二十四个单位九十一名干部的招聘工作又在筹备之中。
