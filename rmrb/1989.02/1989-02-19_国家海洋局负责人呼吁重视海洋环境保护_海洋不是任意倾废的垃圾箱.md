The vice minister of the State Oceanic Administration, Yang Wenhe, recently led a delegation to the London Dumping Convention meeting of contracting parties. Recently, he made a statement saying that the ocean is not a dumping ground for any and all waste. Any group or individual dumping waste into the ocean must do so in accordance with the law. All sectors of society should actively support marine environmental protection.

Unfortunately, many people in our society do not know what the "Dumping Convention" is, and some enterprise leaders do not even understand the relevant treaties and laws in this area, which is very detrimental to marine environmental protection.

It is understood that China has a long coastline. Before the 1970s, the amount of waste dumped into the ocean was relatively small. In the late 1970s, the amount of waste dumped began to increase, gradually leading to pollution. According to incomplete statistics, China annually discharges 1.5 billion tons of domestic sewage and 4.5 billion tons of industrial wastewater into the ocean, causing significant pollution in coastal waters. In the most severely polluted year, Dalian Bay lost over 10,000 kilograms of sea cucumbers and more than 100,000 kilograms of scallops. In some of China's waters, marine biological resources have died off in large numbers, some fish species are on the brink of extinction, and the seawater in some coastal areas has become foul-smelling and unfit for tourism and marine aquaculture. In some harbor areas, wastewater, oil spills, chromium, mercury, and other harmful substances seriously threaten the health of coastal residents.

Yang Wenhe pointed out that even before pollution appeared in China's coastal waters, the ocean had already become an important dumping ground for some industrialized countries. By the early 1970s, almost all coastal areas around the continents had been polluted. In 1972, the British government initiated an intergovernmental conference on marine dumping in London, resulting in the "Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter," known as the "London Dumping Convention." This convention came into effect in 1975 and has since been joined by 62 countries. China joined this convention in 1985, becoming a contracting party.

Yang Wenhe said that before China joined the London Dumping Convention, it had already implemented the "Marine Environmental Protection Law of the People's Republic of China" in 1983. China has also successively promulgated the "Regulations on the Management of Marine Dumping," "Regulations on the Environmental Protection Management of Marine Oil Exploration and Development," and "Regulations on the Management of Ship Pollution Prevention in the Ocean." It has established the "China Marine Surveillance" fleet and aviation brigade to monitor and gather evidence against illegal dumping. At the same time, a national marine environmental pollution monitoring network has been set up, and more than 20 marine dumping zones have been designated. In recent years, the quality of China's marine environment has begun to improve. However, due to the imbalance between the benefits of dumpers and the losses of non-dumpers (especially marine aquaculture and tourism), the imbalance between the benefits of the current generation and the consequences for future generations, and the imbalance between local benefits and overall losses, coupled with the lack of awareness among many people, the difficulty of managing marine dumping remains significant. Therefore, in addition to relevant departments improving management, support from all sectors of society, especially the leaders of relevant enterprises, is also needed.

　　国家海洋局负责人呼吁重视海洋环境保护    
    海洋不是任意倾废的垃圾箱
    本报讯  记者王溪元报道：国家海洋局副局长杨文鹤前不久曾率团参加伦敦倾废公约缔约国会议。近日，他发表谈话说，海洋并不是什么都可容纳的垃圾箱，任何集团和个人向海洋倾倒废弃物都要依法办事，社会各界对于保护海洋环境应当给予积极支持。
    遗憾的是，我们社会中的许多人并不知道什么是“倾废公约”，甚至有的企业领导人也不懂得这方面的条约和法律，这对保护海洋环境十分不利。
    据了解，我国海岸线很长，７０年代以前向海洋倾废的数量较少；７０年代末以后，倾废数量不断加大，逐渐形成污染。据不完全统计，我国每年排入海洋的生活污水达１５亿吨，工业废水４５亿吨，在近岸海区已经造成相当严重的污染。大连湾在最严重的污染年份损失海参１万多公斤、扇贝１０多万公斤。我国一些海域的生物资源大量死亡，有的鱼类面临绝迹，一些海岸的海水变质变臭，旅游资源和海水养殖场被毁。在一些港湾地区，废水、油污、铬、汞等有害物质，严重威胁着沿海居民的身体健康。
    杨文鹤指出，早在中国沿海出现污染现象以前，海洋已成为一些工业发达国家的重要倾废场所。到７０年代初，世界上被污染的海域几乎遍及各个大陆边缘。１９７２年，英国政府发起在伦敦召开了政府间海上倾废公约会议，通过了《防止倾倒废物及其它物质污染海洋的公约》，即《伦敦倾废公约》。这个公约自１９７５年生效，至今已有６２个国家加入。我国于１９８５年加入这一公约，成为该公约的缔约国。
    杨文鹤说，我国在加入伦敦倾废公约之前，已于１９８３年正式施行《中华人民共和国海洋环境保护法》。我国还相继颁布了《海洋倾废管理条例》、《海洋石油勘探开发环境保护管理条例》、《防止船舶污染海洋管理条例》，组建了“中国海监”船队和航空大队，对违章倾废者进行监视和取证。同时，还建起了全国海洋环境污染监测网，划定出２０多个海上倾废区。近几年来，我国海洋环境质量开始好转，但由于存在着倾废者受益与非倾废者（尤其是近海养殖业、旅游业）受损的不平衡，存在着当代人受益与子孙后代承受后果的不平衡，存在着局部受益与全局受损的不平衡，再加上许多人认识不足，海洋倾废管理工作的难度仍很大。所以，除了有关部门改善管理之外，还需要各界人士特别是有关企业的领导给予支持。
