A few years ago, foreign investors came to the Shantou Special Economic Zone with a "try it out" attitude to establish sole proprietorships. Now, due to generally good economic benefits, they are no longer satisfied with renting spaces for factories but are competing to buy and build their own factory buildings. Currently, Shantou Special Zone has established 56 foreign-funded sole proprietorships, accounting for more than one-third of all foreign-invested enterprises in the zone.

Twenty-five of these foreign-funded sole proprietorships have, to varying degrees, expanded their production scale. Some have developed from a single factory into several, while others have formed group enterprises. The new Shinyi Industrial Building has appeared in the Longhu Industrial Zone, attracting much attention.

The Shantou Special Zone has been working to improve the investment environment and enhance work efficiency. It has published a new "Investment Guide," providing various conveniences to allow foreign investors to operate according to international customs. The first Japanese company, Tokyo Components, initially raised nearly a hundred questions when it first arrived. The relevant functional departments of the Special Zone Management Committee provided answers to each question and helped solve specific difficulties, thereby strengthening the investor's confidence. The company decided to expand its production scale just half a year after its establishment. Currently, nearly 20,000 workers are employed in foreign-funded enterprises in Shantou.

　　初来试试看　如今扎下根
　  汕头外商独资企业发展快
    本报讯  记者计泓赓报道：几年前抱着试试看心理到汕头经济特区兴办独资企业的外商，如今因经济效益普遍较好，已不满足于租房办厂，而是竞相买房、建房办厂了。目前，汕头特区已办起外商独资企业５６家，占全区外商投资企业１／３强。
    ２５家外商独资企业程度不同地扩大了生产规模。有的外商独资企业已由一个厂发展成几个厂，有的形成了集团性企业。新益集团工业大厦已在龙湖工业区出现，引人注目。
    汕头特区注意改善投资环境，提高工作效率，出版了新的《投资指南》，提供各种方便，让外商能按国际惯例办事。第一家日资东京元件公司初来时提了近百个问题，特区管委会有关职能部门一一作了解答，并帮助解决具体困难，使对方投资信心增强，刚办半年就决定扩大生产规模。目前汕头在外资企业工作的工人，已有近２万人。
