Residents of Calabria, Italy, oppose the deployment of U.S.-made F-16 fighter jets.

A petition signed by more than 2,500 residents of Calabria, Italy, opposing the deployment of U.S.-made F-16 fighter jets in their region, was submitted today to the Italian presidency, the Vatican, and the U.S. and Soviet embassies in Italy by Carlo Nicotera, chairman of the Italian Committee Against the Deployment of F-16s.

The petition argues that placing F-16 fighter jets, which are instruments of war, in the Calabria region is a "mockery of the peaceful aspirations of the people in this region" and "contradicts the moral principles and the desire for economic and social development of the people in this region." The petition emphasizes that the local people "absolutely refuse to use this nuclear-free zone for the purposes of war."

Originally, 72 U.S. F-16 fighter jets were stationed at a U.S. military base in Spain. Due to opposition from Spanish citizens, NATO decided to relocate these F-16 fighter jets to the southern Italian region of Calabria, specifically to Crotone.

This decision has been approved by the Italian parliament.

　　意大利卡拉布里亚居民
    反对部署美歼击机
    新华社罗马２月２１日电  一份由２５００多意大利卡拉布里亚居民签名的反对意大利接纳美制Ｆ—１６歼击机的呼吁书，今天已由意大利反对部署Ｆ—１６委员会主席卡洛·尼科泰拉呈交意大利总统府和梵蒂冈以及美国、苏联驻意大利大使馆。
    呼吁书认为，在意大利卡拉布里亚地区安置Ｆ—１６歼击机这样的战争工具，是对这一地区人民“和平愿望的嘲弄”，“违背了这一地区人民的道德观念以及发展经济、社会的意愿”。呼吁书强调说，当地人民“绝对拒绝利用这块无核区为战争服务”。
    ７２架美国Ｆ—１６歼击机原驻扎在西班牙美军基地上。由于西班牙公民的反对，北约决定将这些Ｆ—１６歼击机迁驻意大利南部卡拉布里亚地区的克罗托内。
    这一决定已得到意大利议会的批准。
