A sinkhole occurred in Japan

According to a report by the *Mainichi Shimbun*, on the morning of February 10, around 8:30 AM, a circular area with a diameter of 70 meters in Utsunomiya City, Tochigi Prefecture, north of Tokyo, suddenly collapsed, sinking about 30 meters. A stone processing factory on the surface fell into the sinkhole. Fortunately, the factory was unoccupied at the time, and students passing by shortly afterward were unharmed, resulting in no casualties.

The area is known for its stone quarries, and years of mining have created numerous cavities. Locals often store fruits and vegetables in these cavities and have even held exhibitions, concerts, and fashion shows there.

　　日本发生一起地陷
    本报东京２月１８日电  据《每日新闻》报道：东京以北的枥木县宇都宫市境内，本月１０日上午约８点半，一处方圆７０米的地面，突然下陷约３０米。地面上的一个石料加工厂落入地穴。幸好工厂无人，上学的中小学生路过不久，没有人员伤亡。
    当地石料闻名，多年开采形成许多空穴。当地人常在空穴中贮存水果蔬菜，还举行过展览会、音乐会和服装表演。
