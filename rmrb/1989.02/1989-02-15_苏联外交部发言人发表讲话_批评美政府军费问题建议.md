Soviet Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Delivers Speech
Criticizing U.S. Government's Military Spending Proposal

New China News Agency, Moscow, February 13 — Soviet Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Perfiliev today criticized the new U.S. government's proposal to maintain U.S. military spending at the 1989 fiscal year level for the 1990 fiscal year.

Perfiliev said at a press conference that in recent years, U.S. military spending had seen only minor reductions. The U.S. government's proposal means the end of this positive trend, "which cannot but cause the Soviet Union some concern." Moreover, in his speech to the joint session of Congress, President Bush listed the acceleration of the "Star Wars" program as one of his administration's top priorities in the military and political sphere.

However, Perfiliev also noted that the Soviet Union welcomes Bush's remarks about his intention to advance constructive U.S.-Soviet relations.

　　苏联外交部发言人发表讲话    
    批评美政府军费问题建议
    新华社莫斯科２月１３日电  苏联外交部发言人佩尔菲利耶夫今天批评美国新政府关于１９９０财政年度美国军费维持在１９８９财政年度水平上的建议。
    佩尔菲利耶夫在新闻发布会上说，最近几年，美国军费曾有微不足道的削减，美国政府的建议意味着这一积极趋势的终止，“不能不使苏联在一定程度上感到关切”。而且，布什总统在国会两院联席会议上讲话时，把加紧实施“星球大战”计划作为他的政府在军事政治领域的一项优先任务。
    但佩尔菲利耶夫又指出，苏联对布什关于打算推进美苏建设性关系的言论表示欢迎。
