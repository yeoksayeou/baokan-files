	Dear Shao Laoshi:

	Yesterday, the National Federation of Literary and Art Circles held a meeting of its standing committee. All attendees unanimously asked me to report to you: The purpose of this organizational adjustment is to gradually transform the Federation into a Writers' Association, to genuinely help members study and improve their ideological understanding, and to strive for creative achievements. However, everyone hopes that you will remain a member because in Wuhan and Chongqing, you were the most supportive and influential person for the Federation at that time. No one will forget this. Everyone asked me to visit you and discuss this matter, but I have been busy with meetings these days, so I am writing to inform you of everyone's intentions. I will visit you in a couple of days.

	Respectfully yours,

	Lao She

	September 25, 1953

　　老舍致邵力子
    邵老：
    昨天全国文协开常委会，出席者一致地嘱我向您汇报：这次调整组织，目的在能逐步把文协变成作家协会，切实地帮助会员们学习思想，尽力创作。可是大家都愿意您作会员，因为在武汉、在重庆，您是支持那时候的文协最多最有力的人，大家都不会忘记。大家嘱我去拜访您，谈谈此事，可是我这几天每天有会，所以先奉函说明大家的意思，过两天再看您去。　　　　　　　谨致敬礼！
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　老舍
