World Drug Trade Nearly Triples in a Decade
U.S. Deploys Military to Combat Drugs

	The National University of Mexico recently released a research report stating that the global drug trade now accounts for 9% of international trade volume.

	The report indicates that in the nearly 10 years since 1978, the global drug trade has nearly tripled, reaching approximately $600 billion. Of this, the United States alone accounts for $250 billion in drug trade.

	The report emphasizes that drug-producing countries, particularly those in Latin America and the Caribbean, do not reap the greatest benefits. In drug transactions conducted in the United States, drug-producing countries only receive 2% to 4% of the profits.

	The People's Daily, Washington, February 23rd - Officials from the U.S. Department of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff presented a counter-narcotics plan to the House Armed Services Committee on February 22nd, proposing to deploy military forces to the border regions for the "war on drugs."

	The main content of the plan is to have the armed forces establish a secure communication system along the southern border of the United States, erect a barrier of high-altitude balloons, and assist law enforcement agencies in detecting and preventing the smuggling of drugs. The plan also includes increasing funding for the National Guard in the southern border states and deploying large numbers of military personnel to search vehicles, trucks, and luggage entering the country. For this purpose, the United States will spend hundreds of millions of dollars to purchase a large number of high-altitude balloons. It is said that these balloons are equipped with radar and can ascend to altitudes of 3,000 to 5,000 meters to capture low-flying aircraft. It is expected that by the end of this year, this high-altitude balloon barrier will be completed.

	The Pentagon has established three special task forces to coordinate the actions of the military, the Coast Guard, customs, border patrol, immigration, and drug enforcement agencies.

　　世界毒品交易十年增长近三倍
    美国动用军队剿毒
    新华社墨西哥城２月２３日电  墨西哥国立大学最近公布的一份研究报告说，世界毒品交易额已占国际贸易额的９％。
    报告指出，自１９７８年以来的近１０年间，世界毒品交易额增长近３倍，约６０００亿美元，其中，仅美国的毒品交易额就达２５００亿美元。
    报告强调，毒品生产国，尤其是拉美和加勒比地区的毒品生产国并未从中获得最大利益。在美国成交的毒品额中，毒品生产国只获得了２％或４％。
    本报华盛顿２月２３日电　美国国防部和参谋长联席会议的负责官员，２月２２日向众议院军事委员会提出了一项反毒行动计划，准备动用军队投入边境地区的“反毒战”。
    计划的主要内容是由武装部队在美国南部边境建立安全通讯系统，筑起一道高空气球“篱笆”，协助反毒执法部门侦查与阻止毒品偷渡入境。计划还将给南部边境各州的国民警卫队增加经费，动用大批军人搜查入境的汽车、货车和行李。为此，美国将用上亿美元的经费采购大批高空气球，据称这些高空气球装备有雷达，能够升到３０００米到５０００米高空，捕捉低空偷渡的飞机。预计到今年年底，这道高空气球“篱笆”就可以建成。
    五角大楼为了协调军队、海岸警卫队、海关、边防、移民和缉毒部门的行动，设立了三个专门行动小组。
