The Spring Festival is approaching, and the markets in various parts of Sichuan Province have a sufficient supply of most commodities, with more varieties and colors compared to last year, and stable prices.

To ensure that the people can celebrate the New Year joyfully, Sichuan Province has been actively organizing the production of 29 types of scarce daily necessities and durable consumer goods since last October. By the end of the year, 19 types have completed their production plans, with 70% of the increased production allocated to state-owned commercial departments, enriching the festival market supply.

It is understood that the total supply of subsidiary food items this year will reach an all-time high. The total amount of commodities released by state-owned commercial departments has significantly increased. The Chengdu Vegetable Company will have a daily market supply of over 500 tons of vegetables before the festival, and will actively organize fine vegetables to adjust the varieties.

In addition, the Sichuan Provincial People's Government has also made proper arrangements for the Spring Festival market supply in old, minority, and border areas, as well as disaster-stricken areas.

    本报讯  记者罗茂城报道：春节到来之前，四川各地市场大多数商品货源充足，品种花色比去年齐全，价格稳定。
    为让人民群众欢度新春佳节，四川省从去年１０月就积极组织２９种紧缺的日用工业品和耐用消费品，到年底已有１９种完成了增产计划，所增的产品７０％调交国营商业部门，充实了节日货源。
    据了解，今年四川春节市场的副食品供应总量将达到历史最高水平。国营商业部门投放市场的商品总量大幅度增加。成都市蔬菜公司节前蔬菜日上市量５００吨以上，并积极组织精细菜，调剂品种。
    此外，四川省人民政府对老少边地区和灾区的春节市场供应，也已作出了妥善安排。
