Siddhi to Meet Sihanouk in Beijing

Thai Foreign Minister Siddhi Savetsila, on the eve of his visit to China, reiterated that "Thailand supports Prince Sihanouk's five-point peace plan for a political solution to the Cambodian problem," and will continue to support Prince Sihanouk's efforts and proposals for resolving the Cambodian issue.

Siddhi will visit China from February 9 to 12. Before his visit, Siddhi accepted an interview with Chinese journalists and reiterated Thailand's position. He said that during his visit, he would meet with Prince Sihanouk and reaffirm Thailand's support for him. Thailand insists that the future Cambodia should be independent, neutral, and non-aligned, and should be led by Prince Sihanouk.

Siddhi said that on the Cambodian issue, Thailand and ASEAN have two main goals: first, to withdraw Vietnamese troops from Cambodia; second, after the withdrawal, to establish an independent, neutral, non-aligned Cambodia that poses no threat to anyone. Therefore, Thailand hopes that Vietnam, as it has announced, will withdraw its troops from Cambodia by September this year under effective international supervision. Siddhi believes that the solution to the Cambodian problem lies in the four factions (the three factions of the Khmer Rouge and the Phnom Penh regime) reaching consensus. If everyone insists on their own "principles" like Hun Sen, the Cambodian problem will be difficult to solve. He said that Hun Sen's seven points and the five points proposed by the three factions of the Khmer Rouge still have obvious differences. The most significant disagreement is that the three factions of the Khmer Rouge advocate for the establishment of a four-party interim coalition government led by Sihanouk before the elections, while Hun Sen advocates for "maintaining the status quo and retaining his government."

When discussing Hun Sen's insistence on linking troop withdrawal with the cessation of foreign military aid, Siddhi said, "If the troops have been completely withdrawn, aid can naturally be stopped." When asked about the recent statement by a spokesperson for the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry that Cambodia's internal affairs must be resolved by the Cambodian people themselves and that foreigners should not interfere, Siddhi said, "External issues" and "internal issues" cannot be separated. Otherwise, peace in Cambodia will not be achieved.

### 西提将在北京会晤西哈努克　泰国外长访华前夕重申支持西哈努克五点计划

　　西提将在北京会晤西哈努克
　　泰国外长访华前夕重申支持西哈努克五点计划
    新华社曼谷2月8日电　（新华社记者黄勇、中国国际广播电台记者周生）泰国外长西提·沙卫西拉访华前夕在这里重申，“泰国支持西哈努克亲王为政治解决柬埔寨问题提出的五点和平方案”，并将继续支持西哈努克亲王为解决柬埔寨问题所作的努力及其提出的各项主张和建议。
    西提将从2月9日至12日对中国进行访问。西提在访华前夕接受中国记者采访时重申了泰国的上述立场。他说，访问期间他将会晤西哈努克亲王，重申泰国对他的支持。泰国坚持未来的柬埔寨应是独立、中立和不结盟，并且应以西哈努克亲王为首。
    西提说，在柬埔寨问题上，泰国和东盟有两个主要目标：一是要越南军队撤出柬埔寨；二是撤军后建立一个独立、中立、不结盟、对任何人不构成威胁的柬埔寨。因此，泰国希望越南能像它宣布的那样，于今年9月在有效的国际监督下从柬埔寨撤军。西提认为，柬埔寨问题的解决在于柬埔寨四方（民柬三方和金边政权一方）能取得和睦一致。如果都像洪森那样坚持自己的“原则”，柬埔寨问题就难以解决。他说，洪森提出的七点和民柬三方提出的五点还存在着明显的不同之处。其中最主要的分歧是，民柬三方主张在大选前建立以西哈努克为首的四方临时联合政府，而洪森却主张“维持现状，保留自己的政府。”
    在谈到洪森坚持撤军要与停止外国军事援助联系在一起的问题时，西提说，“如果已全部撤军，自然可以停止援助。”当记者问到对越南外交部发言人最近声称柬埔寨内政问题必须由柬人民自己解决、外国不得干涉有何评论时，西提说，“外部问题”和“内部问题是不可分割开来的”。否则，柬和平就不可能实现。
