Some prisoners on medical parole continue to commit crimes. Last December, a law enforcement inspection team from our province, while checking the enforcement situation in the Chenzhou region, discovered that some prisoners, during their medical parole, were not actually treating their illnesses but were instead going out to do business. Some even continued to commit crimes. For example, the criminal Li Zexiong, who was sentenced to nine years in prison for fraud, had served less than a year when he claimed to have early-stage liver cancer and was granted medical parole. After being released, he changed his name to Li Yiming, obtained a business license, and borrowed 10,000 yuan to open a household appliance repair shop. Li Zexiong did not change his ways and repeatedly impersonated the child of a high-ranking official or a procurement officer to defraud individuals or collective funds. On April 18 of last year, he again used the alias "Li Ming" to deceive the Chenzhou region's hardware, electrical, and chemical trade market out of goods such as tape recorders, electric rice cookers, and electric fans, totaling over 7,000 yuan. After the case was exposed, he was arrested by the public security authorities and returned to prison. However, less than 10 days after being imprisoned, Li Zexiong was released again and was hired by a company as the general manager with a monthly salary of 300 yuan. This company reissued a business license for him, made official seals and name stamps, and printed work IDs and business cards, providing him with ample opportunities to engage in resale and fraudulent activities. According to the reporter's investigation, Li Zexiong had previously resold scarce commodities such as steel, cement, color TVs, refrigerators, and cigarettes, and had repeatedly committed fraud.

According to relevant regulations, prisoners on medical parole are not allowed to leave their place of residence without permission. However, Li Zexiong traveled multiple times within a year to Guangzhou, Shaoguan, Hengyang, Zhuzhou, Changsha, and Nanchang, neither reporting to the labor reform execution authorities nor requesting leave from the supervising units. It is puzzling why Li Zexiong was so bold and "well-connected"? The relevant departments should conduct a thorough investigation. At the same time, it is hoped that the relevant departments will strengthen the supervision and management of prisoners on medical parole to uphold the dignity of the law and maintain social order.

### 一些保外就医犯人仍在继续作案

　　一些保外就医犯人仍在继续作案
    去年底，我省执法检查组在检查郴州地区的执法情况时，发现一些犯人在保外就医期间不是治病，而是外出经商，有的甚至继续作案。如因犯诈骗罪被判处有期徒刑９年的罪犯黎泽雄，服刑不足一年便以患早期肝癌为由，保外就医。保出后，他即改名为李一明，办理了营业执照，并贷款１万元，开办了一个家用电器维修部。黎泽雄恶习不改，多次冒充高干子弟或采购人员，诈骗他人或集体钱财。去年４月１８日，他又化名“黎明”，骗走郴州地区五金交电化工商场收录机、电饭煲、电风扇等货物，折款７０００多元。案发后，他被公安部门抓获重新收监。谁知收监不到１０天，黎泽雄又被人保出，还被一个单位聘用为公司总经理，月薪３００元。这个单位为他重新办理了营业执照，刻了公章、钢印，印制了工作证、名片，为他搞倒卖和诈骗活动大开绿灯。据记者调查，黎泽雄先后倒卖过钢材、水泥、彩电、冰箱、香烟等紧俏物资，又多次行骗。
    按照有关规定，保外就医的罪犯不能随意离开居住地外出。但是，黎泽雄一年内竟多次往返于广州、韶关、衡阳、株洲、长沙和南昌等地，既未向劳改执行机关报告，也未向保外监督单位请假。令人不解的是，黎泽雄为什么如此胆大妄为，而且“神通广大”？有关部门应该好好查一查。同时，希望有关部门加强对保外就医犯人的监督管理工作。以维护法律的尊严，稳定社会秩序。
