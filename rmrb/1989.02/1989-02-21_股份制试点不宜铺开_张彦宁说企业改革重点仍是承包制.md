Stock Ownership System Pilot Programs Should Not Be Widely Expanded
Zhang Yanning Says Enterprise Reform Focus Remains on Contract System

BEIJING, Feb. 20 (Xinhua) -- Zhang Yanning, deputy director of the State Commission for Restructuring the Economic System, said today that the pilot programs for the stock ownership system should be controlled and not expanded widely in the next two years. The focus should be on formulating policies and regulations related to the stock ownership system and on conducting non-public stock issuance pilot programs. Public stock issuance pilot programs should only be carried out in a few selected cities, and the state will control the scope of the pilot programs.

He urged that before the state's unified pilot program methods are announced, local authorities should suspend the approval of public stock issuance pilot programs, and the scope of various stock ownership system pilot programs should not be further expanded. Efforts should be concentrated on improving the pilot programs that have already begun.

Zhang made these remarks at a press conference held by the State Commission for Restructuring the Economic System today. He also revealed that to ensure the healthy development of the stock ownership system pilot programs, the State Commission for Restructuring the Economic System, in accordance with the instructions of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, is working with relevant departments to formulate the regulations for stock ownership companies and unified pilot program methods. Some supporting measures are also being actively formulated.

　　股份制试点不宜铺开
    张彦宁说企业改革重点仍是承包制
    本报北京２月２０日讯  国家体改委副主任张彦宁今天指出，股份制试点今明两年主要是抓紧制订与股份制有关的政策法规，搞好不公开发行股票的股份制试点。公开发行股票的股份制试点只在选定的个别城市中进行。国家将对试点面进行必要的控制。
    他要求，在国家统一规定的试点办法公布以前，各地要暂缓审批公开发行股票的股份制试点，各类股份制试点的范围不宜再扩大，要集中精力搞好已经开始的试点。
    张彦宁是在今天体改委召开的一次记者招待会上讲这番话的。他还透露，为使股份制试点健康发展，国家体改委按照党中央和国务院的指示，正在会同有关部门抓紧制订股份制公司条例和统一的试点办法，一些配套措施也在积极制订中。
