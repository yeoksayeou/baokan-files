	Yanshi Micro-Fertilizer Factory Develops High-Efficiency Fertilizer

	People's Daily reports: Only 200 grams of fertilizer per mu of land can increase crop yields by more than 15%. A new type of micro-quantity high-efficiency fertilizer has recently been officially put into production at the Yanshi Micro-Fertilizer Factory in Yanshi County, Henan Province. This fertilizer is designed to meet the different needs of crops for trace elements at different growth stages, using different formulas, which can effectively improve crop yields. It has a significant effect on changing the backward state of agricultural production technology.

	This fertilizer was successfully developed by the Haidian Star Fire Development Department of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences and is jointly produced with the Yanshi Micro-Fertilizer Factory. Currently, the factory has an annual production capacity of 50 tons. To ensure that farmers use the product with confidence, the factory has established a quality credit card system. If the user does not achieve the expected increase in yield, they can claim compensation from the manufacturer with the credit card.

　　偃师微肥厂开发高效化肥
    本报讯  每亩地只需施肥２００克，农作物便可增产１５％以上。一种微量高效化肥最近在河南省偃师县微肥厂正式投入生产。它针对农作物在不同生长期对微量元素的不同需要，采用不同配方制成，可有效提高农作物产量。对改变农业生产技术落后状况有明显效果。
    这种化肥由中国农科院海淀星火开发部研制成功，并与偃师县微肥厂联合生产。目前该厂已形成年产５０吨能力。为了让农民用着放心，工厂还建立质量信誉卡制度，用户使用后如达不到预期增产效果，可凭信用卡向生产厂家索赔。
