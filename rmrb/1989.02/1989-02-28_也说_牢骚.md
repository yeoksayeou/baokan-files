Title: On "Grumbling"

The "People's Forum" published an article titled "After the Grumbling," which seems to bring a breath of fresh air.

Grumbling generally doesn't make it to the grand stage. During the ten years of turmoil, it was as if a thousand horses were silenced, and people were as quiet as winter cicadas. Now, being able to say a few words of understanding and sympathy for those who grumble in a party newspaper is indeed a sign of historical progress.

However, upon careful reflection, while feeling pleased, there is also a sense of "insufficiency and the desire for sufficiency." "After the Grumbling" gives the impression that the common people grumble mainly because their various growing needs are not being met, "and when old needs are satisfied, new needs and new dissatisfactions will arise." The article also advocates that the common people, instead of "sitting still" in a public bus that has stalled on an uphill slope and "cursing," should "get off and help push."

This is certainly reasonable, but it can also be discussed further.

Is "eating from the bowl and cursing after putting it down" merely because the "meat" in the bowl is not sufficient? In fact, what the masses are most disgusted and dissatisfied with is: certain flaws in our various systems, the losses caused by work errors to the economy, and unfair distribution, especially the phenomenon of some party and government leaders using their power for personal gain and being corrupt. This is like a public bus itself having a malfunction and needing a good repair. Mobilizing passengers to "get off and help push" is certainly necessary, but if pushing doesn't work, what can be done about the "passengers"?

The obstacles to rectification and reform are often not with the ordinary people, but with officials and profiteers. The Party Central Committee and the State Council have repeatedly ordered that party and government agencies should decouple from companies and that leading cadres should not hold positions in companies. However, to this day, among the more than 600 companies established by central state agencies, there are still dozens of vice-ministerial level and more than a hundred departmental level administrative leaders who have not resigned from their concurrent or held positions. In some places, the situation is even more serious. It is understandable that the common people whisper and grumble about this.

Furthermore, some reform policies are not that the common people lack the ability to bear them, but rather that some beneficiaries fear that their personal interests will be affected, and they obstruct and hinder reform everywhere. Is it not also understandable that the common people are dissatisfied and grumble?

Our party and state cadres are public servants of the people. Now, there are indeed some "servants" who hold the power given by the people, doing things to embezzle state resources and enrich themselves, engaging in malpractice, and lining their own pockets. It is only natural that the common people are indignant and grumble about this.

Of course, grumbling does not solve problems, but it is indeed public opinion, a warning, and a signal. For those above making and implementing policies, it is feedback; for some leaders, it is also a sobering agent. The most frightening thing is not the sound of grumbling and complaints, but silence, stagnant water. When it gets to that point, it is truly "losing vitality and liveliness." We cannot only see the negative side of grumbling but must also explore the positivity and creativity hidden behind the grumbling of tens of millions of people. It is not surprising that the common people have some grumbling, dissatisfaction, opinions, and criticism. Party and government departments should ensure that the channels for the masses to express various opinions are open, giving the common people a place to speak and making their words effective. Properly guiding the masses' grumbling can have a positive effect on public opinion supervision.

### 也说“牢骚”

　　也说“牢骚”
    维伟
    “人民论坛”发表《牢骚发过之后》一文，似吹出一股清新之风。
    牢骚，一般登不了大雅之堂。十年动乱中更是万马齐喑，人们噤若寒蝉；如今能在党报上为发牢骚者讲上几句谅解、同情的话，亦可谓历史的进步。
    然而，仔细回味，欣慰之余又有点“不足之感和求足之愿”。《牢骚发过之后》给人一种感觉：似乎老百姓发牢骚，主要是他们各类日益增长的需要得不到满足而致，“旧的需要满足了，又会产生新的需要、新的不满”。该文还主张发牢骚的老百姓，与其“稳坐”在爬坡时熄了火的“公共汽车”里“骂娘”，不如“下车帮着推一把”。这当然很有道理，但也还可以再讨论一番。
    “端起碗吃肉，放下碗骂娘”，仅仅是因为碗里的“肉”还不够充足吗？事实上，群众中最反感、最不满的主要是：我们各项制度中的某些弊端，工作失误给经济带来的损失和分配不公，特别是一部分党政领导干部以权谋私、为政不廉等腐败现象。这就好比一部公共汽车本身出现了故障，需要好好修理。靠动员乘客“下车帮着推一把”当然也有必要，但推而不动，又奈“乘客”何？
    治理、整顿，阻力往往不在普通百姓身上，最大的障碍倒是官商、官倒之类。党中央、国务院三令五申，要求党政机关与公司脱钩、领导干部不准在公司任职，但时至如今，在中央国家机关所建６００多公司中，仍有数十名副部级以上和百余名司局级行政领导干部，尚未辞去所兼或所任的职务。在某些地方，情况更为严重。老百姓对此交头接耳、发发牢骚，应该说是可以理解的。
    再有，一些改革政策，并不是老百姓缺乏承受能力，倒是某些既得利益者生怕触及个人的私利，处处为改革设障、作梗。老百姓不满，发牢骚，难道不也应予理解的吗？
    我们党和国家的干部是为人民服务的人民公仆，如今确有那么一些“公仆”掌着人民赋予的权力，干着揩国家油水、肥自身之膘的事情，营私舞弊，中饱私囊。老百姓对此愤愤然，发一些牢骚，不也正是理所当然的吗？
    当然，发牢骚终究解决不了问题，但它毕竟是舆论，是警告，是信号，对上面制定和推行政策来说是个反馈，对某些领导者来说又是一种清醒剂。最可怕的不是牢骚抱怨之声，而是无声无息，死水一潭，真到了那个时候，才叫“失去生机和活力”。我们不能只看到牢骚的消极面，更要发掘出牢骚背后蕴藏在千百万群众中的积极性和创造性。老百姓有些牢骚、不满、意见、批评，大可不必大惊小怪，党和政府部门要使广大群众发表各种意见的渠道畅通，让老百姓有地方讲话，讲了话又起作用。正确地引导群众的牢骚，可以起到舆论监督的积极效果。
