Chen Yizhi, the director of the Chinese Economic System Reform Research Institute, and his deputy directors, Wang Xiaqiang and Li Jun, said in an interview with the *World Economic Herald* reporter: The ten years of reform and opening up have had a significant impact on our country and nation. It is not only about the growth of the national economy and the benefits people have received, but more importantly, it has ended the closed and stagnant situation, opening up a new historical period. Compared to the situation before 1978, it is clear that our country has made considerable progress on the difficult and winding road of reform. Every aspect of the traditional system has been severely impacted. Now, the degree of enterprise autonomy, the role of the market mechanism, the degree of national openness, and the freedom people enjoy in economic, political, and ideological aspects are all unimaginable ten years ago.

Of course, we are facing serious challenges such as inflation, irrational industrial structure, enterprises not bearing losses, corruption among some public officials, and an unhealthy order in the commodity market. However, it must be acknowledged that these problems arose after solving the issue of hunger and shaking up the traditional system. They are new problems that emerged during economic development and the advancement of systemic reform, problems caused by the coexistence of old and new systems and incomplete reform. It is illogical to say that the reform has achieved great success while also claiming that the reform strategy has had major mistakes. It is unreasonable to adopt a completely negative attitude towards one's youth, just as it is unreasonable to use today's understanding of certain problems to deny the reform. On the contrary, the emergence of these new difficulties has further exposed the flaws of the traditional system, requiring us to understand the reform more deeply and to promote the reform at a deeper level.

　　陈一谘、王小强、李峻说：
    十年改革方略没有重大失误
    中国经济体制改革研究所所长陈一谘和副所长王小强、李峻在接受《世界经济导报》记者采访时说：十年的改革开放对于我们的国家和民族具有的重大意义，不仅在于国民经济的增长，人民得到了实惠，更重要的是结束了封闭和停滞的局面，开辟了新的历史时期。只要与一九七八年以前比较，就会看到我国在艰难曲折的改革道路上已经走得相当远了。传统体制的各个方面都受到猛烈冲击，如今企业自主程度、市场机制发挥作用的程度、国家开放的程度以及人民在经济、政治和意识形态等方面享受到的自由程度，都是十年前难以想象的。
    固然，我们面临着通货膨胀、产业结构不合理、企业负盈不负亏、少数公职人员贪污腐败、商品市场秩序不健全等一系列严重问题的挑战；但是，不能不承认这些问题的发生是在解决了饿饭和冲击了传统体制之后发生的，是经济发展和体制改革推进中的新问题，是改革中新旧体制并存、改革不彻底造成的。说十年改革取得了巨大成就，同时又说改革的方略有重大失误，在逻辑上是说不通的。用今天对问题的某些认识来否定改革，就像成年人对自己青少年时代采取一概否定的态度一样没有道理。相反，这些新难题的发生，恰恰进一步暴露出传统体制的弊端，为我们更深刻地理解改革，在更深层次上推进改革提出了更高的要求。
