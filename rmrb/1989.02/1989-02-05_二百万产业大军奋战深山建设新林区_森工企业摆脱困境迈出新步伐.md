	The 2 million industrial army that has long been fighting in the deep mountains of China's forestry industry has, since last year, fully implemented the contract responsibility system aimed at reducing resource consumption. In the face of reduced logging quotas and a major natural disaster, the 2 million industrial army has shown a spirit of unity and struggle, comprehensively developing and building new forest areas, taking a gratifying step towards overcoming difficulties.

	The forestry industry enterprises that began construction in the 1950s have, after decades of development, now established more than 140 forestry bureaus and a 2 million strong industrial army. However, due to years of over-logging, the resources in the forest areas are increasingly depleted, leading many enterprises to face difficulties. In recent years, under the condition of reduced logging tasks, many forest areas have explored the path of comprehensive development, insisting on forestry as the foundation, logging while afforesting, and many forest farms have risen again with new forests, relatively reducing resource consumption. Last year, state-owned forest areas planted 47,000 mu of seedlings and afforested 4.01 million mu. Northeast and Inner Mongolia are the main timber production areas in China. Last year, in addition to completing the national logging tasks, they also afforested 3.75 million mu in the cold northern region.

	To get out of the economic difficulties, many enterprises have started various businesses combining forest product processing and comprehensive utilization. They use small materials and logging residues to process fiberboard and plywood, and have established many small commodity processing enterprises producing toothpicks, chopsticks, and shoe lasts. Last year, the various businesses of forestry enterprises in Northeast and Inner Mongolia generated more than 2 billion yuan in revenue, a 5.3% increase from the previous year. 32 forestry bureaus had various business revenues accounting for more than 1/3 of their total revenue.

	In the past, daily necessities and sideline products in the forest areas were all supplied from outside. Some areas, although they developed some business projects, were mainly for self-sufficiency. With the development of various businesses, a large number of forest, sideline, local, and special products from the forest areas have begun to be shipped out, becoming a major source of economic income for forestry enterprises. Last year, forestry enterprises in Northeast and Inner Mongolia produced 100,000 kg of ginseng and 150,000 kg of edible fungi. Most forestry bureaus achieved self-sufficiency in meat, eggs, and poultry. Forestry enterprises in Jilin Province actively exported ginseng, matsutake, and wild vegetables and other local specialties, earning 215,000 US dollars in foreign exchange last year.

　　二百万产业大军奋战深山建设新林区
　　森工企业摆脱困境迈出新步伐
    本报讯  记者高保生报道：常年奋战在深山老林的我国森林工业企业，去年以来全面推行以减少资源消耗为目标的承包经营责任制。在采伐量下降，又遇特大自然灾害的情况下，２００万产业大军发扬团结拚搏精神，综合开发建设新林区，为摆脱困境迈出了可喜的一步。
    ５０年代开始兴建的我国森林工业企业，经过几十年的发展，现已拥有１４０余个林业局、２００万产业大军。然而，由于多年过量采伐，林区资源日益枯竭，导致许多企业面临困境。近年来，在采伐任务减少的情况下，不少林区转而探索综合开发的道路，坚持以营林为基础，一面采伐，一面造林，不少林场又崛起一片片新的森林，资源消耗相对减少。去年国有林区共育苗４．７万多亩，造林４０１万亩。东北内蒙古林区是我国木材的主要产地，去年除圆满完成国家采伐任务外，还在寒冷的北国新造林３７５万多亩。
    为了摆脱经济上的困境，许多企业办起了林产加工和综合利用相结合的多种经营。他们利用小材小料和采伐剩余物加工成纤维板、胶合板，还办了众多生产牙签、筷子、鞋楦等小商品的加工企业。去年东北内蒙古林区森工企业多种经营收入达２０多亿元，比上年增长５．３％。有３２个林业局多种经营收入占到总收入的１／３以上。
    在林区，过去日用消费品和副食品全部靠从外地调进。有的虽发展了一些经营项目，也是为了自给自足。随着多种经营的发展，林区大批林副土特产品已开始外调，成为森工企业的一大经济收入来源。去年东北内蒙古森工企业产人参达１００万公斤、食用菌１５０万公斤。大多数林业局实现了肉蛋鸡自给有余。吉林省森工企业积极出口人参、松茸和山野菜等土特产品，去年创汇达２１５万美元。
