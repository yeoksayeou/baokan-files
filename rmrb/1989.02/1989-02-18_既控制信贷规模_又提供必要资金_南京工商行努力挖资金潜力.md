The Nanjing Commercial Bank effectively controlled the scale of industrial production loans last year, with the growth rate significantly lower than the increase in enterprise sales revenue. Compared to 1987, each yuan of loans generated 1.15 yuan of economic output. This improvement in loan utilization efficiency not only controlled the credit scale but also provided the necessary funds for production development.

According to regulations, the Nanjing Commercial Bank was allowed to increase production loans by 600 million yuan last year, but it actually only increased by 337 million yuan. In the past, the bank's total production loans grew in tandem with industrial output value. However, last year, the growth rate of total loans was about 40% lower than the growth rate of industrial output value.

Since last year, with the strengthening of national macro-control, the Nanjing Commercial Bank has faced new challenges: on one hand, the credit scale must be tightened, and on the other hand, economic development requires an increase in new loans. Where is the solution? After investigation, the Nanjing Commercial Bank concluded that passively reducing credit would not only affect the normal development of current production but also, once the monetary policy eases, credit would expand again, leading to another round of loss of control. Only by activating credit and improving the efficiency of fund utilization can we, while tightening, still meet the funding needs of economic development.

The Nanjing Commercial Bank surveyed 365 enterprises, classifying them into six categories based on economic efficiency and development prospects, and prioritizing loans to support enterprises and products with good economic efficiency and development prospects. The Yangzi Ethylene Project is a key project during the Seventh Five-Year Plan, and it successfully started trial production in July 1987. In the first half of last year, the bank provided 180 million yuan in loans for this project. Last year, the main chemical products of the Yangzi Ethylene Project fully completed their planned targets, and their economic efficiency was leading among similar enterprises in the country. For other enterprises with poor economic efficiency and low management levels, the bank limited loans and strictly implemented the tightening policy. According to statistics at the beginning of this year, the proportion of loans to third-class enterprises (those with poor economic performance and no development prospects) in the bank's total loans decreased from 4.5% a year ago to 1.9%, while the proportion of loans to first-class enterprises increased from 53% to 60%. This indicates that the loan structure has been optimized, and the direction of loans has become more reasonable.

The Nanjing Commercial Bank also took new measures to address the situation where some enterprises had backward management and severely occupied funds. It stipulated the quantity of products and materials that enterprises must clear, and for those that did not meet the requirements, it significantly increased the interest rate on occupied funds, even to the point of recalling loans. This measure effectively promoted the clearance of inventory and the unleashing of potential. According to incomplete statistics from the bank, last year, enterprises processed and sold off accumulated products and materials worth about 280 million yuan.

### 既控制信贷规模　又提供必要资金  南京工商行努力挖资金潜力

　　既控制信贷规模　又提供必要资金    
    南京工商行努力挖资金潜力
    本报讯  （新华社记者华惠毅）据南京有关部门提供的资料，南京市去年工业生产贷款的增长幅度大大小于企业销售收入增长幅度，与１９８７年相比，每１元钱贷款发挥了１．１５元的用途。贷款使用效益的提高，即有效地控制了信贷规模，又为生产发展提供了必要的资金。
    按照规定，南京市工商银行去年可增发生产贷款６亿元，而实际只增加了３．３７亿元。过去，这个行的生产贷款总额基本上与工业产值同步增长，而去年，贷款总额增长幅度比产值增长幅度约低４０％。
    去年以来，随着国家宏观控制的加强，南京市工商银行面临新的矛盾：一方面信贷规模必须紧缩，另一方面经济发展又需要增加新的贷款。出路在哪里？南京市工商银行经过调查后认为，消极地削减信贷不仅会影响当前生产的正常发展，而且今后银根一有松动，信贷又会膨胀，导致又一轮失控。只有搞活信贷，提高资金使用效益，才能在紧缩的同时，仍满足经济发展所需要的资金。
    南京市工商银行考察了３６５个企业，从经济效益和发展前途等６个方面分类排队，在安排贷款时扶优限劣，重点支持经济效益好、有发展前途的企业及其产品。扬子乙烯工程是国家七五期间的重点项目，１９８７年７月投料试车一次成功。去年上半年，市工商银行为该工程贷款１．８亿元。去年，扬子乙烯工程的主要化工产品全面完成了计划指标，经济效益在国内同行业试生产企业中居领先地位。对于其它经济效益差、管理水平低的企业，市工商银行限量贷款，坚决执行紧缩政策。据今年初的统计，南京市经济效益差、产品没有发展前途的三类企业的贷款，在该行的贷款总额中的比重，由一年前的４．５％下降为１．９％，而一类企业的贷款所占的比重，则由５３％上升到６０％，这表明贷款结构得以优化，贷款投向更趋合理。
    南京市工商银行还针对一些企业管理落后、占压资金严重的情况，采取新措施，规定了企业必须清理的产品和物资的数量，达不到要求者，大幅度提高占用资金的利率，直至收回贷款。这一措施有效地推动了企业清仓挖潜。据市工商银行的不完全统计，去年企业处理积压产品和物资，共计２．８亿元左右。
