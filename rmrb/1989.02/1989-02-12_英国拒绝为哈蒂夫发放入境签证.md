Britain refuses to issue visa for Hatif

Xinhua News Agency, London, February 9

The British Foreign Office announced on February 9 that it has refused to issue a visa for Abdul Hatif, the Vice President of the Kabul regime in Afghanistan.

Hatif was invited by the British Independent Television Network to speak on the situation in Afghanistan after the withdrawal of Soviet troops on the "World This Week" program on February 12.

A spokesperson for the British Foreign Office said that because the British government does not have "substantial relations" with the Najibullah regime, the government could not issue a visa for such an important figure from that regime.

　　英国拒绝为哈蒂夫发放入境签证
    新华社伦敦２月９日电  英国外交部９日宣布拒绝为阿富汗喀布尔政权的副总统阿卜杜勒·哈蒂夫发放入境签证。
    哈蒂夫应英国独立电视网邀请，原定于１２日在英国电视台“世界一周”节目里发表关于苏军撤离后阿富汗局势的讲话。
    英国外交部发言人说，因为英国政府与纳吉布拉政权之间“不存在实质性的关系”，因此英国政府不能给该政权如此显要的人物发放入境签证。
