News photographs, with their vivid and believable images, reflect social realities and report on new developments, situations, and problems in the reform process. This form of news is increasingly popular among readers. To strengthen the dissemination of this visual news, and to encourage photographers to capture more and better news photographs, our newspaper, in collaboration with the Suzhou Spring Blossom Vacuum Cleaner Factory in Jiangsu Province, will hold a news photography contest from March 1 to August 31.

The content and themes of the contest photographs are not restricted, but they must have news value, be true to life, vivid, and have a sense of immediacy and a breath of life. The text descriptions should be detailed and concise.

Contest photographs should be submitted as 8-inch black-and-white prints, with the time and place of shooting clearly indicated. Please send two copies to the Photography Department of the People's Daily in Beijing, marking the envelope "News Photography Contest."

After selection, the best photographs will be published in our newspaper. At the end of the contest, a panel of judges will select one first prize, three second prizes, ten third prizes, and fifty excellent prizes from the submitted photographs, and will award certificates and prize money accordingly.

We welcome everyone to participate enthusiastically and contribute their excellent works to the readers.
