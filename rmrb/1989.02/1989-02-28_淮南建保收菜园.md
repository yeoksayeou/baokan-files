Huainan Builds Flood-Proof Vegetable Gardens

    The People's Daily, Hefei, February 27th - Reporter Zhang Zhen Guo reports: Despite the cold weather before and after the Spring Festival, the vegetable market in Huainan City remains well-stocked with a stable supply and prices. When asked about the reasons, the main factor is the newly built 13 flood-proof vegetable bases that have come to the rescue.

    The municipal government of Huainan has always been concerned about the vegetable supply for its 700,000 residents. Therefore, last year, they adopted the approach of "government funding, district and township contributions, and farmers' investment" to raise 16 million yuan. This funding was used to build 13 fully-equipped flood-proof bases, expanding the flood-proof area in the city's specialized vegetable fields to 65%.

　　淮南建保收菜园
    本报合肥２月２７日电  记者张振国报道：春节前后，天寒地冻。安徽淮南市蔬菜市场依然是菜源充足，菜价稳定。问及原因，主要是新建的１３处旱涝保收蔬菜基地“救了驾”。
    淮南市府对７０余万市民的吃菜问题常悬于怀。因此，去年他们采取“政府拿，区乡挤，农民掏”的办法，筹得资金１６０多万元，兴建１３处配套齐全的旱涝保收基地，使全市专业菜地中的旱涝保收面积扩大到６５％。
