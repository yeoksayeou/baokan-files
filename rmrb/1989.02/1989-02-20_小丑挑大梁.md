The end of the year and the beginning of the new year, the Hubei Provincial Beijing Opera Troupe came to Beijing to perform the new play "Gao Yao Zhang." For participating in the annual "Plum Blossom Award" evaluation, this was already the "last train," which was very disadvantageous. But "heaven has eyes," the actor playing the main character, the clown Ju Shuihui, ascended the "Plum Blossom List," and his long-cherished wish was fulfilled!

An actor's inclusion in the "Plum Blossom List" should, according to its original intention, be "the plum blossom's fragrance comes from the cold winter." Otherwise, even if the stage work is done perfectly, it is forced into the list, how fragrant can it be?

Ju Shuihui was not lucky enough to be on this list.

Niu Biao watched Ju Shuihui's "Gao Yao Zhang" and wrote a review article "Clowns Can Also Stand Center Stage" (see this newspaper on January 14). Niu Biao originally studied the clown role and was a disciple of Master Xiao Changhua. Now he has changed his profession to become a professor. Niu Biao talks about the clown role, naturally speaking modest and appropriate insider language. Whether talking about Kunqu clown Liu Yilong and Lin Jifan, or talking about Beijing clown Ju Shuihui, it is all sincere art criticism, fellow artists exchanging views, and absolutely not using deliberately sensational "milestone" phrases to blindly praise. Too many "milestones" do not make a grand sight. Haven't you seen the stones every kilometer along the roadside?

Niu Biao evaluates Ju Shuihui's artistic creation from the perspective of the clown role, believing that in the past, clowns on the traditional opera stage were mostly supporting characters, minor characters, following the main characters on the center stage. However, Ju Shuihui's performance of Gao Yao Zhang is a main character, standing in the center, and successfully so. In fact, Ju Shuihui's performances of "Xu Jiujing Promoted" and "Legend of the Medicine King Temple" in recent years are also main characters played by the clown role and "standing in the center." Since the new period, the Hubei Provincial Beijing Opera Troupe has brought a new play to Beijing every time, and each new play has a new clown role created by Ju Shuihui, with new plays, new ideas, and new clown roles, continuously leaving a deep impression on the audience. If Ju Shuihui's performance of "Xu Jiujing Promoted" was still that of an unknown clown, then now Ju Shuihui not only "stands in the center" but also takes the lead. A clown, consecutively taking the lead in different new plays, is rare on the Beijing opera stage after liberation. Even before liberation, except for Ye Shengzhang, there were not many cases of clowns taking the lead. Therefore, Ju Shuihui's honorable inclusion in the "Plum Blossom List" is not surprising; it should have been like this. As far as I know, Ju Shuihui was not the first time to enter the candidate circle this time; he had also "failed the exam many times." Among these, there may or may not be various "center stage" public opinions or biases. Of course, it is not ruled out that he was not yet fully seasoned.

On the traditional opera stage, it can only be generally said that clowns mostly stand on the side, because some clowns "jump" higher than the main characters on the center stage. Ye Shengzhang's performance of "The Drunken Beggar" has tables stacked on tables, much higher than the seven-star platform that Ma Lianliang performed as Zhuge Liang borrowing the east wind. On the opera stage, in social life, it is very difficult to distinguish high and low, wise and foolish by the position where a person stands. During the Cultural Revolution, I had an old friend who was neither a "capitalist roader" nor a "reactionary authority," but was still "pulled out" by the power-hungry on the center stage and given a hat: "Jumping clown." Even the policy at that time did not have this item, deliberately insulting people! The old friend could only be indignant. If it were the clowns in the opera, they would definitely humorously return this trick. I remember there was a play where the old master on the center stage unreasonably vented his anger on the clown on the side, roughly as follows:

Old Master: You scoundrel!
Clown: Yes, Master.
Old Master: Despicable to the extreme!
Clown: Yes, Master.
Old Master: Get out of here!
Clown: Yes, Master, it's time to retire!

Life is like a play. But still, the play is more enjoyable!

　　小丑挑大梁
    蓝翎
    岁末年初，湖北省京剧团来京演出新剧目《膏药章》，对于参加一年一度的戏剧“梅花奖”评奖来说，这已是“末班车”，大为不利。但“老天有眼”，扮演主要人物的丑角朱世慧却登上了“梅花榜”，夙愿得偿矣！
    演员得中“梅花榜”，按其本意，应是“梅花香自苦寒来”。否则，即使台下功夫作得再到家，楞挤入榜中，其香究有几何？
    朱世慧并非侥幸中此榜。
    钮镖看了朱世慧的《膏药章》，写了评介文章《丑角也能站台中》（见本报１月１４日）。钮镖原学丑行，乃萧长华老先生的弟子，现在改行当教授了。钮镖谈丑行，说的自然是谦虚而得体的内行话，无论是谈昆丑刘异龙、林继凡，还是谈京丑朱世慧，都是诚挚论艺，同行切磋，绝不用故意耸人听闻的“里程碑”之类的话头瞎捧。“里程碑”竖多了并不雄伟。君不见公路两旁一公里一块的石头乎？
    钮镖是从丑行的角度评朱世慧的艺术创造的，认为过去戏曲舞台上的丑角多系陪衬人物、小人物，跟着站台中的大人物转。而朱世慧演的膏药章却是主要人物，站了台中，而且成功。其实，朱世慧这些年演的《徐九经升官记》、《药王庙传奇》，也是以丑行扮演主要人物而“站台中”。新时期以来，湖北省京剧团每次进京都带来一个新戏，每个新戏都有朱世慧创造的一个新丑角，以新戏、新意、新丑角，连续给观众积累下了深刻的印象。如果说朱世慧演《徐九经升官记》以前还是一无名小丑，那么，现在的朱世慧不仅“站台中”，而且挑大梁了。一个丑角，连续在不同的新剧目中挑大梁演出，这在解放后的京剧舞台上尚属罕见。即使在解放前，小丑挑大梁的除叶盛章外，也不多见。所以朱世慧荣登“梅花榜”并不新奇，早该如此。据笔者所知，朱世慧这回并非初次进入候选圈，他也曾“屡试不第”。这其中有没有各种“站台中”的舆论或偏见？当然也不排除他火候不到家的因素。
    在传统戏曲舞台上，只能笼统说小丑大多站台侧，因为有的小丑比“站台中”的大人物“跳”得还高。叶盛章演《酒丐》，桌子摞桌子，比马连良演诸葛亮借东风登的七星坛要高得多。在戏曲舞台上，在社会生活中，是很难以人物站在什么位置来区别高下贤愚的。“文革”中，我有一老友，既不算“走资派”，也够不上“反动权威”，但还是被“站台中”的弄权儿“揪”了出来，帽子一顶：“跳梁小丑”。连当时的“政策”也没这一条，故意侮辱人！老友只有愤愤然。若换上戏曲中的小丑，定会幽默的把这一套顶回去。记得有出戏，“站台中”的老爷无理迁怒站台侧的小丑，大致有如下几句对白：
    老爷：混帐东西！
    小丑：是——老爷。
    老爷：可恶至极！
    小丑：是——老爷。
    老爷：滚了出去！
    小丑：是——老爷退堂喽！
    人生如戏。然而还是戏好看！
