	Positive Developments
	People's Daily Commentator

	According to the Geneva Agreement, the Soviet military has fully withdrawn from Afghanistan. With this, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan has come to an end. Although the severe consequences of the war will not be easily eliminated in the short term, the withdrawal of Soviet troops undoubtedly creates favorable conditions for the restoration of Afghanistan's independence, neutrality, and non-aligned status, and for the Afghan people, who have suffered greatly from the war, to once again enjoy peace and tranquility. This will also have a positive impact on the political resolution of other hotspots in the world. Therefore, this is a welcome positive development.

	The nearly 10-year-long Soviet invasion of Afghanistan was highly unpopular. As recently acknowledged by Soviet leaders, this war was a "crime." It left Afghanistan's mountains and rivers in ruins, and countless lives were lost. Hundreds of thousands of people became refugees. The Soviet Union also paid a heavy price, spending hundreds of billions of dollars and losing tens of thousands of soldiers. Its international image was severely damaged, and it found itself in a passive and isolated position. Now, with the complete withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan, the Soviet Union has shed a heavy burden, which is beneficial for the Soviet Union to reverse its passive diplomatic situation and concentrate on domestic economic and political reforms, a wise move.

	The outcome of the Afghan war once again tells us that in today's world, power politics and hegemony are increasingly ineffective, and the practice of imposing one's will through military means is bound to fail. The world is undergoing tremendous changes, and a new type of international relations is needed. Various opinions have been expressed and explorations are being conducted. More and more people recognize that to prevent the tragedy of the Afghan war from repeating, to enable all countries to coexist peacefully, and to establish a new international political order is extremely necessary and significant.

	Currently, the international situation is undergoing a turning point, with the world moving from confrontation to dialogue, from tension to relaxation. As a long-standing important factor influencing the international situation, the relationship between the Soviet Union and the United States continues to improve. The Soviet Union, based on the "new thinking," further adjusts its diplomatic strategy, and the United States' global strategy also undergoes corresponding changes. It can be said that the end of the Afghan war is not only the result of the long struggle of the Afghan people and the international community's upholding of justice and maintaining international norms, but also a product of the new international situation.

	Although the Soviet military has fully withdrawn from Afghanistan, achieving true national reconciliation in this country, and having the relevant parties engage in peaceful consultations to establish a broad-based coalition government, will likely be a difficult process, and even the danger of civil war cannot be ruled out. In addition, the repatriation and resettlement of the hundreds of thousands of Afghan refugees who were forced to flee abroad due to the war is also a very arduous task. People hope that the Soviet Union and the relevant countries will continue to adopt a positive attitude, do more to facilitate the reconciliation of various Afghan factions, help this war-torn country shake off the shackles of war, and embark on the path of peaceful reconstruction as soon as possible.

　　积极的事态发展
    本报评论员
    按照日内瓦协议规定的撤军期限，苏联军队已全部撤出了阿富汗。至此，苏联对阿富汗的侵略战争宣告结束。虽然战争造成的严重后果短期内难以消除，但苏军的撤离无疑将为恢复阿富汗的独立、中立和不结盟地位，为使饱尝战争之苦的阿富汗人民重享和平安宁的生活创造了有利条件，对世界其它地区热点取得政治解决也将起推动作用。因此，这是值得欢迎的积极的事态发展。
    历时９年多的苏联侵阿战争是很不得人心的。正如苏联领导人最近所公开承认的，这场战争是一个“罪恶”。它使阿富汗山河破碎，生灵涂炭，数百万人沦为难民。苏联也为此付出了巨大代价，耗掉了数百亿美元的财力、物力，损兵折将数万人之多，其国际形象受到严重损害，陷入了被动孤立的境地。现在，苏军全部撤离阿富汗，这无疑使苏联卸下了一个沉重的包袱，有利于苏联扭转被动的外交局面和集中力量进行国内经济政治改革，不失为明智之举。
    阿富汗战争的结局再次告诉人们，在当今世界上，强权政治和霸权主义已越来越行不通，凭借军事手段把自己的意志强加于人的作法，肯定要碰壁。世界正在发生巨大的变化，需要新型的国际关系。各国舆论对此发表了种种议论，并进行着探索。愈来愈多的人认识到，为避免类似阿富汗战争的悲剧重演，使世界各国得以和平相处，建立国际政治新秩序是非常必要、有重要意义的。
    当前，国际形势正在发生转折性变化，世界正从对抗转向对话，由紧张转到缓和。作为长期来影响国际局势重要因素的苏美两国关系继续改善。苏联根据“新思维”进一步调整外交战略，美国的世界战略也发生相应的变化。可以说，阿富汗战争的结束，不仅是阿富汗人民长期斗争和国际社会主持正义、维护国际关系准则的结果，也是国际新形势下的产物。
    苏联军队虽然全部撤离阿富汗，但这个国家要实现真正的民族和解，有关各方和平协商建立起基础广泛的联合政府，看来还需要一个艰苦的过程，甚至不能排除内战的危险。此外，因战争而被迫流落异国他乡的数百万阿富汗难民的回返和安置，也是一项十分艰巨的工作。人们期待苏联以及有关国家继续采取积极的态度，多做有利于阿富汗各派和解的工作，使这个遭受战火洗劫的国家摆脱战乱的困扰，早日走上和平建设的途程。
