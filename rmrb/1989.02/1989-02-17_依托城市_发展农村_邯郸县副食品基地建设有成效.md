In recent years, Handan County in Hebei Province has adhered to the principle of "leveraging cities to develop rural areas, serving cities to enrich rural areas." The county has accelerated the construction of a food supply base. In 1988, the total production of meat, milk, eggs, and vegetables reached 279.7 million kilograms, 66.3 million kilograms, 247.2 million kilograms, and 2356.9 million kilograms respectively, effectively replenishing the "basket of vegetables" for the residents of Handan City and neighboring urban areas.

In developing the food supply base, the county has taken measures such as tailoring support to local conditions to foster specialized towns, villages, and households. As of now, utilizing sandy areas, fertile fields, and water surfaces, five production bases for fruits, vegetables, meat, milk, eggs, and other products have been established, covering a total area of 300,000 mu (approximately 20,000 hectares). This has led to the development of 10 specialized livestock and poultry breeding towns, 35 specialized villages, and 960 specialized households. In Wangdongbao Village, Qizhuda Town, young farmer Chen Zhanzhi has built a pig farm with over 900 pigs. Heishaji Town, a specialized chicken-raising town, has over 250,000 chickens, with nearly 50 large-scale chicken farmers each raising over 1,000 chickens.

Only by ensuring that farmers benefit can their enthusiasm for participating in the construction of the base be mobilized. To this end, the county has formulated a series of preferential policies, such as reducing the burden of mandatory procurement for farmers by allowing them to use meat, vegetables, and eggs to offset grain quotas; encouraging the development of saline-alkali wasteland and utilizing hills and slopes for food production; implementing a protective price for pig purchases; and providing material rewards to those who have made significant contributions to the scaled production of food.

The county also pays attention to the role of government agencies and enterprises, encouraging departments, factories, and mines to cooperate with specialized food-producing towns and villages, providing targeted services. The Handan Steel Plant and Beizhuangzhang Village have jointly built a food supply base. Factories and mines invest in the food supply base, which in turn provides food for the factories and mines, benefiting both sides. This approach has been recognized by relevant ministries and commissions as well as the provincial and municipal governments.

　　依托城市　发展农村
    邯郸县副食品基地建设有成效
    本报讯  记者李建兴报道：近几年来，河北省邯郸县遵循“依托城市、发展农村、服务城市、富裕农村”的方针，加速副食品基地建设。１９８８年该县肉奶蛋菜总产量分别达到２７９．７万公斤、６６．３万公斤、２４７．２万公斤和２３５６．９万公斤，有效地充实了邯郸市等邻近城市群众的菜篮子。
    这个县在发展副食品基地中采取的一项措施是，因地制宜扶植专业乡、专业村、专业户。截止到目前，利用沙带、良田、水面已建起瓜果菜肉奶蛋共５个生产基地，总面积３０万亩，发展了１０个畜禽养殖专业乡、３５个专业村和９６０个专业户。七岔道乡王东堡村青年农民陈占辉建起的猪场，拥有存栏猪９００多头。养鸡专业镇河沙镇存栏鸡达２５万只，千只以上养鸡大户近５０个。
    只有让农民得到实利，才能调动他们参加基地建设的积极性。为此，这个县制定了一系列优惠政策，如减轻农民定购负担，实行以肉菜蛋顶粮；鼓励开发盐碱荒地，利用岗坡丘陵发展副食品生产；实行生猪收购保护价；对发展副食品规模生产贡献突出者，物质上奖励。
    这个县还注意发挥机关、企事业单位的作用，鼓励部门、厂矿与副食品生产专业乡村对口协作，定向服务。邯郸钢厂与北寨张村共建副食品基地，厂矿企业投资副食品基地，基地提供副食品为厂矿企业服务，厂矿和农村互利互惠，受到有关部委及省市的重视。
