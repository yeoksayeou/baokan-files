Japan's 13th Chess Saint final fourth round has concluded, with Chess Saint Small Lin Guoyi defeating challenger Wu Gongzhu. Leading with a 3-1 advantage, victory is within reach. The fourth round began on the morning of the 22nd in Ikawa Town, Gunma Prefecture. Although Small Lin Guoyi played with white and moved second, he played steadily, riding on the momentum of two consecutive victories. Wu Gongzhu, fighting to reverse his losing streak, put up a tenacious struggle. The match was intense, and it wasn't until 6:18 PM on the 23rd, after 236 moves, that the outcome was clear. Small Lin Guoyi won by 6.5 points.

If this reigning Chess Saint can secure a win in the fifth round, scheduled for March 1st in Otaru City, Hokkaido, he will achieve his third consecutive title as Japan's highest honor in Go—the Chess Saint.

　　日本棋圣赛小林光一胜利在望
    新华社东京２月２３日电  （记者姚力）日本第十三届棋圣决赛第四盘弈罢，小林光一棋圣又胜挑战者武宫正树，以３胜１负领先，胜利在望。第四盘对局于２２日上午在群马县的伊香保町揭开战幕。小林光一虽执白后手，但乘两连胜之威弈得稳健。武宫正树为挽回败势顽强拚杀。双方这盘棋战得难解难分，直到２３日傍晚６时１８分第２３６手才见分晓，小林光一以６目半获胜。
    这位现任棋圣若能于３月１日在北海道小樽市举行的第五盘对局中得手，他将第三次蝉联日本围棋最高名誉——棋圣。
