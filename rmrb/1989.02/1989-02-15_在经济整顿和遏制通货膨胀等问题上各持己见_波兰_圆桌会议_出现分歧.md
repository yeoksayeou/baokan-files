In today's meeting of the economic and social policy subgroup of the Polish "Round Table," government representatives and Solidarity trade union delegates held differing views on the "National Economic Stabilization Plan" and controlling inflation, each sticking to their own positions.

The "National Economic Stabilization Plan" was drafted by the Polish government led by Rakowski after reviewing the mistakes of the previous government's economic policies. Its main content is to deepen reforms, adjust the economic structure and investment direction to strengthen agriculture and the food industry, aiming to ease market supply and improve people's living standards in the next two years. This plan was approved by the parliament on January 31. To gain societal understanding and support, the government decided to submit the plan to the "Round Table" for discussion.

Polish United Workers' Party Politburo member and Central Committee Secretary Baka introduced this plan at the subgroup meeting and suggested including it in the "Round Table" agreement—the "Social Agreement." Solidarity trade union representatives thought the plan was "good in many aspects," but because it lacked social policy measures, it could not become part of the "Social Agreement."

In today's meeting, government representatives, when speaking about inflation, pointed out that it was necessary to control inflation through a series of measures such as adjusting prices, tightening monetary policy, and limiting wage increases. Solidarity trade union representatives, however, advocated for a significant increase in prices, while simultaneously significantly increasing workers' wages and subsidies. They claimed that a cycle of price and wage increases was inevitable.

According to the Polish Press Agency, the evaluations of the 8-year economic reform by both sides also differed greatly.

Baka said in an interview after the meeting that having different opinions was a "normal phenomenon," but as the discussion progressed and issues were clarified, the differences in opinions would narrow and even be eliminated.

　　在经济整顿和遏制通货膨胀等问题上各持己见    
    波兰“圆桌会议”出现分歧
    新华社华沙２月１３日电  （记者汤德乔）在今天举行的波兰“圆桌会议”经济和社会政策问题小组会议上，当局和团结工会代表在“国民经济整顿计划”、遏制通货膨胀等问题上看法不一，各执己见。
    “国民经济整顿计划”是以拉科夫斯基为首的波兰政府在研究了上届政府经济政策的失误后制定的，其主要内容是通过深化改革、调整经济结构和投资方向来加强农业和食品工业，争取今明两年缓解市场供应，改善人民生活。这一计划已于１月３１日由议会通过。为了取得社会的理解和支持，政府决定把计划提交“圆桌会议”讨论。
    波兰统一工人党中央政治局委员、中央书记巴卡在小组会上介绍了这一计划，并建议把它列入“圆桌会议”协议——“社会协议”中。团结工会代表认为，计划“在许多方面是好的”，但由于它缺乏社会政策方面的措施，不能成为“社会协议”的组成部分。
    在今天的会议上，政府代表就通货膨胀问题发言时指出，必须通过调整物价、紧缩银根、限制工资提高幅度等配套措施来遏制通货膨胀。团结工会代表则主张大幅度提高物价，同时大幅度增加职工工资和补贴。并声称，物价和工资轮番上涨是不可避免的。
    据波通社报道，在对８年经济改革的评价上，双方代表的看法也大相径庭。
    巴卡在会后接受记者采访时说，有不同观点是“正常的现象”，但随着讨论的展开和问题的澄清，双方的意见分歧会缩小，甚至会消除。
