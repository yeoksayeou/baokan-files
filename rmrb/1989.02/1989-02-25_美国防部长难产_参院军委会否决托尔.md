    The nomination of John Thole to be the U.S. Secretary of Defense faces significant obstacles. The Senate Armed Services Committee tonight voted on the nomination, resulting in a rejection with 11 votes against and 9 votes in favor.

    Since the Senate Armed Services Committee began hearings on Thole's nomination in late January, the hearings have focused extensively on Thole's alleged alcoholism, womanizing, and his ties to defense contractors. The central debate has been whether these "personal life" issues, particularly his alleged alcoholism, would affect his ability to serve as Secretary of Defense.

    An official accompanying President Bush on his visit to Tokyo stated that the President believes Thole is an outstanding candidate for the position of Secretary of Defense and that the President has no other choice.

　　美国防部长难产
    参院军委会否决托尔
    本报华盛顿２月２３日电  记者张启昕报道：美国参议院军事委员会今晚就提名约翰·托尔担任国防部长问题进行投票，结果以１１票反对、９票赞成否决了此项提名。
    自从１月下旬参议院军委会开始举行对托尔提名的听证会以来，听证会对托尔嗜酒、好色以及他与军火商的关系十分关注，辩论的中心是这些“个人生活”问题，特别是嗜酒，是否影响他担任国防部长要职。
    陪同布什总统在东京访问的政府官员说，总统相信托尔是个杰出的国防部长人选，总统别无选择。
