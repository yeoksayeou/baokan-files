Albanian News Agency issued a statement expressing concern over the situation in southern Kosovo.

New China News Agency, Tirana, February 25. The Albanian News Agency issued a statement on February 24 regarding the situation in Kosovo, Yugoslavia, stating that the current situation in Kosovo "may be exploited by provocateurs who intend to use force and terrorism against the Albanian people."

Albanian newspapers reported that tens of thousands of Albanian workers in Kosovo have been on strike in recent days. Leaders of the state and party of Yugoslavia, along with the Chief of the General Staff of the Army, have traveled to Kosovo. Albania believes this is a sign that the Yugoslav authorities are preparing to take extraordinary measures in Kosovo.

The statement from the Albanian News Agency said, "If Yugoslavia abolishes Kosovo's autonomy, it will be a heavy blow to the ideals for which the peoples of Yugoslavia, including the Albanians, have shed blood and made sacrifices."

　　阿尔巴尼亚通讯社发表声明
    对南科索沃局势感到不安
    新华社地拉那２月２５日电  阿尔巴尼亚通讯社２４日就南斯拉夫科索沃局势发表声明说，科索沃目前的局势“可能被企图用武力和恐怖手段对付阿尔巴尼亚族人的挑衅者所利用”。
    阿尔巴尼亚报纸报道说，科索沃数万阿族工人近日来连续举行罢工。南国家和党的领导人及军队总参谋长一起前往科索沃。阿尔巴尼亚认为这是南当局要在科索沃采取非常措施的先兆。
    阿通社的声明说，“如果南斯拉夫取消科索沃的自治权，将是对包括阿族人在内的南各族人民曾为之流血牺牲的理想的沉重打击”。
