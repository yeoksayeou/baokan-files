Tales of Counter-Hijacking

Since the first airplane was hijacked in 1931, the history of world aviation has been filled with records of hijackings and counter-hijackings.

On average, one airplane is hijacked every four days worldwide. From 1960 to 1980, over 500 hijacking incidents occurred around the world. In 1968, there were 30 incidents, in 1969, 91 incidents, and in 1970, 88 incidents. Even today, the number of hijacking incidents remains high, causing significant losses and impacts that are hard to quantify.

Facing the frequent hijacking incidents, to establish an international cooperation mechanism for dealing with illegal hijackings of aircraft, the International Civil Aviation Organization adopted the "Convention on Offenses and Certain Other Acts Committed on Board Aircraft" (Tokyo Convention) on September 14, 1963. The United Nations raised the issue of international aircraft hijacking as an agenda item for its General Assembly in 1969 and adopted a resolution condemning hijacking in 1970. The International Civil Aviation Organization also formed the Committee to Prevent Unlawful Interference with Civil Aviation in 1969, resulting in the adoption of the "Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft" (The Hague Convention) on December 16, 1970. On September 23, 1971, the "Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Civil Aviation" (Montreal Convention) was also formulated. China applied to join the "Tokyo Convention" on November 14, 1978, and subsequently joined the "Hague Convention" and the "Montreal Convention" in 1980. Although more than 100 countries have joined the "International Civil Aviation Conventions," due to differences in political systems and religious beliefs among countries, the "rapid strike and punishment" of terrorists has been significantly compromised.

　　反劫机史话
    自１９３１年第一架飞机被劫持后，世界航空史上就充满了劫机和反劫机的记载。
    平均每４天，世界上就有一架飞机被劫持。从１９６０年到１９８０年，世界各地共发生５００多起劫机事件，其中１９６８年发生３０起，１９６９年发生９１起，１９７０年发生８８起。直至今日，世界上的劫机事件居高不下，其带来的损失和影响难与人言。
    面对迭出的劫机事件，为了建立在飞机遭受非法劫持时的国际合作体制，国际民用航空组织于１９６３年９月１４日通过了《关于在航空器内的犯罪和其他某些行为的公约》（东京条约）。联合国于１９６９年把国际性劫持飞机问题作为大会议题提了出来，并于１９７０年通过了谴责劫机的决议。国际民用航空机构也于１９６９年组成防止非法妨害民用航空委员会，结果于１９７０年１２月１６日通过了《关于制止非法劫持航空器的公约》（海牙公约）。１９７１年９月２３日又制定了《关于制止非法危害民用航空安全的行为的公约》（蒙特利尔公约）。我国于１９７８年１１月１４日申请加入《东京条约》，１９８０年又相继加入了《海牙公约》和《蒙特利尔公约》。尽管加入“国际民用航空公约”的国家已有１００多个，但由于各国政治制度和宗教信仰不尽相同，事实上，对恐怖分子的“迅捷打击和制裁”大大地打了折扣。
