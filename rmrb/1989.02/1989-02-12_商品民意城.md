	The City of Consumer Opinion
	Tang Ruoshui
	In the United States, the city of Peoria in Illinois is neither famous for its historical sites nor for its scenic beauty. However, it has gained national attention as the "New Product Testing City."

	As early as the beginning of this century, the city was recognized as the "most typical American city." Because the demographic structure of Peoria closely resembles that of the entire United States (the proportions of intellectual and manual laborers, the percentage of college-educated individuals, the proportion of immigrants, and the ratios of elderly and middle-aged people are all remarkably similar to national averages), consumer opinion surveys conducted in Peoria often reflect the general preferences of Americans. In the 1920s, a new brand of soda received high praise in a survey conducted in Peoria, and it indeed became popular nationwide. Since then, the once-obscure city of Peoria has become a focal point for manufacturers of all sizes, who view it as a "touchstone" for determining whether new products will be successful in the market.

	The residents of Peoria have also developed a habit of willingly participating in surveys. Whether the surveyors call by phone, send letters, or conduct face-to-face interviews, the residents respond openly and honestly. For instance, not long ago, they frankly expressed their dissatisfaction with two new products from a famous food company—pork rib sandwiches and Italian flatbread with a Mexican flavor. As a result, the company decided not to expand the production of these two items to avoid potential losses.

　　“商品民意城”
    唐若水
    美国伊利诺斯州皮奥利亚市既无名胜古迹，又无旖旎风光，然而却以“新产品测试城”而举国瞩目。
    早在本世纪初，该城就被公认为“最典型的美国城市”。由于该城的人口结构与美国全国的人口结构极其相似（即脑力劳动者和体力劳动者在总人口中所占比例、受过高等教育者的比例、外来移民的比例、老年人和中年人的比例等都与全国比例惊人地近似），因而在该城进行的“商品民意测验”往往能代表一般美国人的爱好。本世纪２０年代时一种新牌号的汽水在该城民意调查中呼声极高，后来果然在全国打响。自此以后，默默无闻的皮奥利亚市便成了大小厂家关注的中心，厂商们纷纷将它视作新产品是否能行销的“试金石”。
    皮奥利亚城的市民也养成了乐于接受采访的习惯，不管调查人是打电话、写信还是面对面询问，他们作答时态度开诚布公。如前不久，他们直率表示对一家著名食品公司推出的两项新产品——排骨三明治和带有墨西哥风味的意大利葱油饼的“不满”，于是该公司不扩大这两种食品的生产，以避免损失。
