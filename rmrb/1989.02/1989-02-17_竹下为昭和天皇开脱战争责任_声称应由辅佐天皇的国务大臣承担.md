Bamboo Down Exonerates Showa Emperor from War Responsibility
Claims Responsibility Should Lie with Ministers Advising the Emperor

New China News Agency, Tokyo, February 15th - According to Kyodo News, opposition parties continued to question Prime Minister Takeshita in the Diet today regarding the Showa Emperor's war responsibility. Takeshita, in his response, exonerated the Showa Emperor from war responsibility.

Takeshita stated, "During the last war, the Showa Emperor made every effort to avoid the war and made a wise decision to end it."

Prime Minister Takeshita further said, "Under the old constitution, politics were conducted through the advice and assistance of ministers and other institutions. The Emperor never altered these decisions for personal gain."

It is believed that this is the first time Prime Minister Takeshita has clearly expressed his views on the Showa Emperor's war responsibility, asserting that the Showa Emperor bears no responsibility for the last war of aggression. Instead, the war responsibility should be borne by the ministers who advised the Emperor.

　　竹下为昭和天皇开脱战争责任    
    声称应由辅佐天皇的国务大臣承担
    新华社东京２月１５日电  据共同社报道，在野党今天在国会继续就昭和天皇战争责任向竹下首相提出质疑。竹下在答辩中为昭和天皇开脱战争责任。
    竹下说，“在上次大战中，昭和天皇为避免战争作出了全面努力，对结束战争作出了英明决断”。
    竹下首相还说，“据认为，在旧宪法之下，政治是通过国务大臣和其他机构的辅弼、辅佐进行的，天皇未曾为自己的私利修改过辅弼、辅佐的决定”。
    据认为，这是竹下首相比较明确地就昭和天皇的战争责任问题表示了自己的观点，即昭和天皇不对上次的对外侵略战争负有责任，战争责任应由辅佐天皇的国务大臣们承担。
