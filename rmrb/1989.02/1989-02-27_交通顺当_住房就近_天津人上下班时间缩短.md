Tianjin recently conducted a survey of 1,000 households to determine the average commute time for workers. The results showed that the average round-trip commute time was 52.7 minutes, a reduction of 26.52 minutes compared to the 79.22 minutes recorded in a similar survey conducted in 1983.

The primary reason for the reduction in commute time is the improvement in traffic conditions. In recent years, Tianjin has constructed and widened several major urban roads, built a few large overpasses, and completed the inner and middle ring roads along with more than a dozen radial roads. These efforts have significantly alleviated the city's traffic congestion. Additionally, the municipal government has focused on relocating workers to nearby housing, allocating housing closer to workplaces, and hiring workers locally. Over the past few years, Tianjin has relocated tens of thousands of households.

### 交通顺当　住房就近  天津人上下班时间缩短

　　交通顺当　住房就近
    天津人上下班时间缩短
    新华社天津２月２６日电  （记者马杰）天津市政府最近对城市千户职工上下班往返时间进行了户卷调查，结果发现，这些职工平均上下班往返途中的时间为５２．７分钟，比１９８３年第一次城市千名职工户卷调查时的７９．２２分钟减少了２６．５２分钟。
    天津职工上下班途中时间缩短的主要原因是交通状况好转。近几年天津修建和拓宽了城市交通干线，还兴建了几座大型立交桥，并建成了中环、内环交通干线和十几条放射交通线，在一定程度上缓解了城市交通紧张状况。另外，市政府还注意就近为职工换房、分配住房，就近招工等。几年来，天津为几十万户居民调换了住房。
