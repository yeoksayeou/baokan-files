	Mao Weidong and His "Safety Work Method"
	By Yan Shigu, People's Daily Reporter

	On-time safety operations, smooth and unobstructed, the Linfen Railway Bureau, which is marching towards 3,000 days of safety on March 18, has created a new safety record for the entire railway system. More notably, Bureau Chief Mao Weidong has broken away from traditional management methods and developed the "Safety Work Method," which brings safety production under comprehensive control.

	At the national transportation safety work conference held in June last year, Premier Li Peng, when discussing the relationship between objective factors and subjective efforts, praised the Linfen Railway Bureau for its 2,700 consecutive days of safe production. Vice Premier Zhou Jiahuai, in his report, fully introduced and affirmed the Linfen Railway Bureau's "Safety Work Method."

	"Emphasizing the human factor, adhering to preventive measures, and stressing the simultaneous development of 'software integration' and 'hardware development,' integrating leadership efforts in safety with workers' safety efforts." This is the guiding principle of the bureau's safety work method.

	The Linfen Railway Bureau is located on the Shandong-Pu Railway line, spanning 680 kilometers with over 23,000 employees. Apart from passenger transport, the annual freight volume is 28.8 million tons, with over 75% being coal, making it a crucial channel for transporting coal out of Shanxi.

	The Shandong-Pu Railway was initially a narrow-gauge line with outdated equipment. Coupled with the damage and influence of the Cultural Revolution, the discipline among workers was lax, and the safety situation was always passive.

	When Mao Weidong took over the leadership of the bureau in 1983, he faced a chaotic management situation with frequent accidents. With over 30 years of railway experience, he felt that the problem was too serious to be tolerated for even a moment.

	Upon taking office, the first thing Mao Weidong did was to raise the safety banner, prioritizing safety production. He focused on the three major safety pillars: personnel, equipment, and management, conducting in-depth investigations and research, and exploring new safety paths suitable for railways.

	The decisive factor in railway safety operations is people. Mao Weidong proposed the requirement to be "qualified party members, qualified league members, qualified cadres, and qualified workers," and established political, cultural, and professional "three-in-one" training classes. Subsequently, in the leadership of the bureau, stations, and workshops, he launched a campaign to "eliminate good-personalism and combat bureaucratism," making sweeping adjustments and rectifications. Workers who neglected their duties were punished, and station masters who did not perform their duties were removed. Mao Weidong emphasized at every meeting: "The discipline of our team is one word, 'iron'!" On this basis, he carried out a comprehensive rectification of "fighting a foundational battle and setting standards for all work," establishing new safety production norms.

	The railway has been operating on a "three-shift-and-a-half" system for decades. In early 1984, Mao Weidong noticed from a statistical table that the nighttime accident rate was over 76%. This phenomenon caught his attention, and he conducted a special investigation and analysis of several accident causes, discovering that continuous 12-hour shifts at night often left workers exhausted. Mao Weidong discussed with his colleagues and, after trials, decided to break the old rule that was detrimental to safety, changing the intermediate stations and shunting groups from the original "three-shift-and-a-half" to "four-short-shifts," dividing one long night shift into two short night shifts. At the time when people are most tired at midnight, they switch shifts, ensuring safety without increasing personnel. At the same time, along the line, rooms were vacated, and bedding was provided, establishing a system where night-shift workers rest 4 hours before their shift. These reforms were effective, reducing nighttime accidents by more than half. They were recognized and promoted by the Ministry of Railways.

	Equipment is an important material foundation for ensuring safety. Mao Weidong spared no expense on "overdue service" and "operation with faults" lines. Over the years, he invested 28 million yuan, successively installing automatic braking devices on locomotives, converting level crossings to grade-separated crossings, equipping busy crossings with automatic alarm devices, and using flat wireless shunting devices for shunting operations. Moreover, the bureau organizes at least two major equipment inspections per year, requiring the chief of the engineering section to inspect the lines, the chief of the mechanical section to inspect the locomotives, and the chief of the electrical section to inspect the signal and interlocking devices in the station areas. They draw network diagrams of the discovered problems, assign specific people and measures, and solve them within a limited time.

	However, safety is not isolated. From last year, Mao Weidong expanded the scope of prevention, extending the safety efforts to outside the railway. He signed safety agreements with over a hundred factories and enterprises and signed safety contracts with nearly 10,000 motor vehicle drivers within a 5-kilometer radius.

	Implementing the "Safety Work Method" has set a precedent in the railway industry's safety management.

　　毛维栋和他的《安全工作法》
    本报记者　颜世贵
    安全正点，畅通无阻，向着３月１８日３０００天进军的临汾铁路分局，以其创造的全路安全历史新纪录令人欣喜，而分局长毛维栋跳出传统的因袭管理方法，摸索出的把安全生产纳入全方位控制状态的《安全工作法》，则更为引人瞩目。
    在去年６月召开的全国交通安全工作会议上，李鹏总理讲到客观因素和主观努力的关系时，表扬了临汾铁路分局连续安全生产２７００天的成绩。邹家华国务委员在报告中全面介绍和肯定了临汾铁路分局的《安全工作法》。
    “突出人的因素，坚持事前防范，强调‘软件组合’与‘硬件开发’同时并举，把领导抓安全和职工保安全融为一体。”是这个分局创立安全工作法的总则。
    临汾铁路分局位于南同蒲铁路线，全长６８０公里，有２３０００多名职工。除客运之外，年货运量２８８０万吨，其中煤运量占７５％以上，是晋煤外运的一条重要通道。
    南同蒲铁路最初是窄轨，设备条件很陈旧，加上“文革”的破坏和影响，职工纪律松弛，安全情况始终处于被动局面。
    当毛维栋１９８３年接任这个分局的领导时，面对的是个管理混乱、事故频出的烂摊子。３０多年的铁路生涯，使他感到问题的严重性一刻也不能容忍下去了。
    上任伊始，毛维栋着手的第一件事：举起安全旗帜，把安全生产放在首位。他紧紧抓住人员、设备、管理三大安全支柱，深入调查研究，探索适合铁路特点的安全新路。
    对铁路安全运输起着决定性作用的是人。毛维栋提出了当“合格党员，合格团员，合格干部，合格工人”的要求，开办政治、文化、业务“三位一体”的培训班；接着在分局、站段、车间三级领导中，开展“围剿”好人主义和反对官僚主义活动，大刀阔斧的调整和整顿，玩忽职守的工人被处分了，不务正业的站长被撤职了。毛维栋大会小会的强调说：“我们这支队伍的纪律，就是一个字，姓‘铁’！”在此基础上，他又进行了“大打基础翻身仗，各项工作上标准”的综合治理，建立安全生产新规范。
    铁路行车几十年实行“三班半”工作制。１９８４年初，毛维栋在一项统计表上看到，夜间事故率占到７６％以上。这一现象引起了他的思考，专门调查分析了几起事故原因，发现夜间当班连续１２小时作业，人的精力往往不济。毛维栋与同事们反复商量，并经过试点，决定破除这个不利安全的旧规章，将分局中间站和调车组由原来的“三班半”改为“四小班”，把一个长夜班改为两个小夜班。正当午夜人困马乏时换班，既不增加人员，又保证了安全。同时，在沿线各站，腾出房屋，配备卧具，制定了夜班职工提前４小时到站休息制度。这些改革，果然奏效，使夜间事故减少了一半以上。得到铁道部的认可和推广。
    设备是确保安全的重要物质基础。毛维栋对“超期服役”和“带病运转”的线路，不惜“血本”，舍得花钱。几年来投资２８００万元，先后在机车上安装了自动停车装置，将平交改立交道口，给繁忙的道口配备了自动报警器，调车作业则采用了平面无线调车装置……而且分局每年至少组织两次设备大检查，要求工务段长上工区检查线路，机务段长添乘检查机车，电务段长上车站区间检查信联闭设备，将发现的问题绘成网络图，定人、定措施，限期解决。
    然而，安全不是孤立的。从前年起，毛维栋拓宽防范领域，把抓安全的触角又伸向路外。与上百家厂矿企业签订了专用线安全协议；与５里以内的近万辆机动车辆驾驶员，签订了通过道口的安全合同。
    实施《安全工作法》，开创了铁路行业安全管理的先例。
