Shanghai has seen a notable contrast in the enthusiasm of its youth for the Spring Festival and Christmas. The recent Spring Festival and the Christmas celebrations a month earlier revealed a stark difference in the level of excitement among young people. The question of how to infuse traditional festivals with new content and provide them with more contemporary entertainment forms has attracted attention.

The enthusiasm of Shanghai's youth for Christmas began two years ago and reached a peak last December. Millions of Christmas cards were exchanged. Many Western-style restaurants and entertainment venues introduced Christmas-themed events, which were unexpectedly successful. The Christmas Eve dance party at the People's Hotel on Nanjing West Road, with tickets priced at 70 yuan each, was fully booked. The Christmas dinner at the Delux Western Restaurant, priced between 38 and 45 yuan per person, also surprisingly sold out over 100 seats. In contrast, a month later during the Spring Festival, aside from the persistent sound of firecrackers, young people showed much less enthusiasm for celebrating. When asked how they spent the Spring Festival, many young people gave similar responses: "visiting elderly relatives and friends" or "watching TV and resting," reflecting a sense of boredom.

One is a traditional Chinese festival, and the other is a foreign one. Why do young people perceive such a stark contrast between the two?

The reporter believes that young people in the 1980s have a strong desire for novelty and trendiness. The annual Spring Festival has lost its novelty for them. In contrast, the newly introduced Christmas, with its novel entertainment forms and festive atmosphere, provides young people with a new kind of excitement and a sense of being in vogue.

Reflecting on the "Cold Spring Festival, Hot Christmas" phenomenon, it is clear that as material living standards improve, there is a need for a more diverse and vibrant cultural life to guide young people, who have a strong desire for novelty, and to meet their increasingly urgent spiritual needs.

### 上海出现“春节冷、圣诞热”现象  青年人要求赋予传统节日新内容新形式

　　上海出现“春节冷、圣诞热”现象   
    青年人要求赋予传统节日新内容新形式
    据新华社上海２月１７日电  （记者严卫民）刚刚过去的春节和一个多月前的圣诞节，在上海青年中表现出明显的热冷不均。如何为传统节日赋予新的内容，提供具有时代感的娱乐形式，已引起人们的关注。
    上海青年对过圣诞节的热情，始于前年，去年１２月下旬达到高潮。千百万张圣诞卡在邮路上穿梭。许多西餐社和娱乐场所首次推出的圣诞节目，都获得了意外的成功。位于南京西路的人民饭店举办的圣诞子夜舞会，７０元一张票竟告客满；德大西餐社３８元至４５元一客的圣诞大菜，也出乎意料地售出１００多客。相反，一个多月后的春节，除了禁而不止的一些鞭炮声外，青年人节日狂欢的劲头却小多了。记者询问一些年轻人春节是如何度过的，回答几乎是一致的：“给老人拜年，跑跑亲戚”或“看看电视，休息休息”，显出一种百无聊赖的情绪。
    一个是中国的传统节日，而另一个是外国的，为何在青年心目中造成如此强烈的反差呢？
    记者认为，８０年代的年轻人具有强烈的求新和追求时尚的欲望。年年要过的春节，对他们已无任何新鲜感可言了。而初次“引进”的圣诞节，它的新奇的娱乐形式和狂欢场面，使青年人可感到一种新的刺激和领略时尚的满足。
    从“春节冷、圣诞热”的现象来思考，可以看到，在物质生活水平逐步提高的今天，应当以更加丰富多彩的文化生活，来引导求新欲望强烈的青年人，满足他们越趋迫切的精神需求。
