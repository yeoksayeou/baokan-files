The U.S. Department of Defense said yesterday in a report on military personnel that due to economic development and a decrease in the number of qualified young people, the military is facing difficulties in recruitment.

The report said that in the fourth quarter of last year, the U.S. military recruitment encountered a situation where the quota could not be filled for the first time in nearly 10 years.

The Pentagon's report pointed out that the Army and Navy have had to recruit more applicants who have passed legal checks. The Marine Corps and Air Force have met their recruitment quotas, but finding qualified candidates from among them is difficult.

Grant Green, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Manpower and Reserve Affairs, said that the proportion of young people in the total population will continue to decline before the 1996 fiscal year.

　　招兵买马困难　五角大楼发愁
    新华社华盛顿２月２４日电  美国国防部昨天在一份兵力情况报告中说，由于经济的发达和合格的适龄人员数量减少，军队的征兵遇到困难。
    报告说，美国军队在去年第四季度的征兵工作中，近１０年来第一次出现招不满名额的现象。
    五角大楼的报告指出，陆军和海军不得不招收更多的经法律检验的报名者。海军陆战队和空军征兵的报名数额已满，但从中选出符合条件的人却很困难。
    负责武器和人员管理的国防部长助理格兰特·格林说，青年在总人口中的比例在１９９６年度以前将继续下降。
