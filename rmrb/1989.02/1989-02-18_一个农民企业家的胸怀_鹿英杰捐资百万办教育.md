A Farmer Entrepreneur's Magnanimity: Lu Yingjie Donates 1 Million Yuan for Education

According to a report by the *Shanxi Daily*, Lu Yingjie, the Party branch secretary of Fengbi Village in Yicheng County, a farmer entrepreneur, took out 1 million yuan from his own pocket to build a teaching building for the village school!

Lu Yingjie is just an ordinary party member from the countryside. His life was not wealthy in the past. Under the guidance of the Party's policy of reform and opening up, he developed from a transportation specialist with just one tractor to owning four private enterprises today, with fixed assets of over 5 million yuan, an annual output value of over 10 million yuan, and an annual net profit of over 1 million yuan. After becoming the Party branch secretary of the village in 1987, he took charge of both economic construction and the cause of education. He resolutely donated over 1 million yuan to build a teaching building with a construction area of 2,300 square meters for the village. He also ensured that all children in the village could attend school for free and gave each teacher an additional one-level salary increase.

    本报讯  据《山西日报》报道：翼城县封比村党支部书记，农民企业家鹿英杰，从腰包里掏出１００万元，给村里学校盖起一座教学大楼！
    鹿英杰不过是农村一个普通党员，以前的日子也并不富裕，在党的开放搞活政策的指引下，他从开始只有一辆拖拉机的运输专业户，发展到如今已拥有四个私人企业，固定资产５００多万元，年产值１０００多万元，年获纯利１００多万元。１９８７年他担任村党支部书记后，一手抓经济建设，一手抓教育事业。毅然捐资１００多万元，给村里盖建筑面积为２３００平方米的教学大楼，并让全村儿童免费上学，给教师每人浮动一级工资。
