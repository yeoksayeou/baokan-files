    The poverty alleviation work in Gansu Province has transitioned from mere relief to economic development, bringing about significant changes in the rural economy of impoverished regions. Over the past five years, 1,040,000 farming households and 6,000,000 farmers have escaped poverty and are now on the path to prosperity.

    Since 1983, Gansu Province has allocated nearly 500 million yuan in special funds for poverty-stricken areas (including the national support portion). In the process of poverty alleviation, traditional methods have been reformed, concentrating funds to develop commercial agriculture, livestock breeding, township enterprises, household sideline industries, and infrastructure projects that enhance agricultural capabilities, as well as technology introduction and intellectual development. This has laid the foundation for a series of grain, oil, forestry, fruit, and livestock bases, significantly increasing the commercial rate and becoming the primary source of income for farmers in impoverished regions. Over five years, the proportion of impoverished households with an annual per capita income of less than 200 yuan has decreased from 52.4% to around 20%, and those with an annual per capita income of less than 150 yuan have decreased from 26.7% to 10.5%. Gansu has also mobilized various sectors of society to jointly carry out poverty alleviation work.

　　改革传统扶贫方式　激发贫困地区内在活力
　　甘肃五年有六百万农民脱贫
    本报讯  甘肃省扶贫工作完成了由单纯的救济向经济开发转变，贫困地区的农村经济发生了可喜的变化，近５年中有１０４万农户、６００万农民摆脱贫困，开始向富裕之路迈进。
    １９８３年以来，甘肃省用于贫困地区专项资金（包括国家扶持部分）近５亿元。在扶贫中，改革传统的扶贫方式，集中使用资金，兴办以商品生产为主的种植业、养殖业、乡镇企业、家庭副业和有助于增强农业后劲的基础建设、科技引进、智力开发等项目，初步建立起一批粮、油、林、果、畜禽基地，商品率大大提高，成为贫困地区农民经济收入的主要来源。５年中，全省农民人均纯收入在２００元以下的贫困户由５２．４％下降到２０％左右，人均纯收入在１５０元以下的农户由２６．７％下降到１０．５％。甘肃还组织社会各方面的力量共同做好扶贫工作。　　　　　　　（谢庆昌）
