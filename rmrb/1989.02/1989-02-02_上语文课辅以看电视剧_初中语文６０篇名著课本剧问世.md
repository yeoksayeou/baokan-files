	Using Television Dramas to Supplement Language Classes
	60 Classic Works from Junior High School Language Textbooks Adapted into Television Dramas

	Beijing, February 1, (Xinhua) — Reporter Bi Quanzhong reports: Recently, 60 classic works from the junior high school language textbooks have been adapted into television dramas by the Beijing People's Art Theatre and released as video tapes by the Beijing Higher Education Audio-Visual Publishing House.

	The television drama series, titled "Good Teachers and Friends," is divided into two parts, with a total of 60 episodes, each corresponding to one textbook chapter. According to the different characteristics and styles of the selected chapters, various forms such as costume recitation, monodrama, costume cross-talk, and drama are used. The series adheres to the principle of being faithful to the original works and not interfering with teaching, while avoiding the "lecturing" of textbook chapters according to the teaching syllabus. Instead, it fully expresses the content and artistic charm of the chapters through exquisite artistic creation. The series is directed and performed by famous artists from the Beijing People's Art Theatre, including Zhou Zheng, Su Min, Ren Baoxian, and Han Shansu.

	Some educators in the capital who watched the series said: "The renowned Beijing People's Art Theatre has adapted world-classics for middle school students, setting an example for the arts community to support education." They also pointed out that this textbook drama will play an active role in improving the quality of middle school language teaching. Currently, there are few language teachers nationwide who can teach using standard Mandarin. This textbook drama, which presents the content of the chapters in pure standard Mandarin, can also make up for this deficiency.

	It is understood that the Beijing People's Art Theatre also plans to adapt classic works from the senior high school language textbooks into textbook dramas, but funding is lacking. Educators in the capital call for support from all sectors of society.

　　上语文课辅以看电视剧
    初中语文６０篇名著课本剧问世
    本报北京２月１日讯  记者毕全忠报道：我国初中语文课本中的６０篇名著，最近由北京人民艺术剧院编成电视剧演出，并制成录像带由北京高教音像出版社发行。
    这部名为《良师益友》的语文课本剧分两集，共６０个节目，一篇课文一个节目，根据所选课文的不同特色和风格，采用化妆朗诵、独角戏、化妆相声、话剧等多种表现形式，遵循严格忠于原著、不干扰教学的原则，又不按照教学大纲去“讲解”课文，而通过精湛的艺术创造，对课文内容和艺术神韵作了充分的表达。这部课本剧由北京人艺的著名艺术家编导，由周正、苏民、任宝贤、韩善续等一批著名演员表演。
    首都教育界一些人士观看后说：“大名鼎鼎的北京人艺为中学生编演举世名篇，为文艺界支援教育树立了榜样。”他们还指出这种课本剧对提高中学语文课的教学质量将起积极作用。目前，全国中学语文教师中能用准确的普通话教学的为数不多。这部课本剧用纯正的普通话表现课文内容，亦可补此缺陷。
    据了解，北京人艺还想将高中语文中的名篇编演成课本剧，但经费阙如。首都教育界人士呼吁社会各界予以支持。
