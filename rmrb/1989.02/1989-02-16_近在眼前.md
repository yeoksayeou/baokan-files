Title: Right Before My Eyes

When I have some free time at home, I like to press my face against the window lattice and gaze at the picturesque natural scenery outside. At this moment, I can look far across to the lights on the opposite shore, or closely observe the seaside garden; I can ponder, or I can reflect in silence. But often, I discard all my thoughts, captivated and overwhelmed by the scene before me, unable to come to my senses for a long time.

The vast expanse of sky over the sea is constantly changing. Sometimes it is a simple, fresh sketch, sometimes a watercolor with transparent and flowing brushstrokes, and sometimes a heavy, beautiful oil painting. Even more astonishing is the sight of the faint purple hues of the setting sun evenly scattered across the blue sky, with two towering black clouds, their edges glowing red, stubbornly standing on either side of the fiery orb. A segment of orange-red mist shrouds the distant mountains, while before a thunderstorm, the deep blue sky is swiftly swallowed by a black monster, a scene that is heart-stopping.

The sea surface is unusually calm, with waves dancing and reflecting the sky. In its embrace, it cradles the shadow of white clouds. Sails catch the wind and ride the waves, gliding between the sea and sky, adding splashes of bright yellow and vivid red to the blue and white, scattering a riot of colors. The highway stretches along the coast, with cars and ships traveling together, coming and going in an endless stream.

The seaside garden is delicate and intricate, a paradise for the elderly and children. When night falls, the osmanthus flowers release a faint fragrance, creating a serene and warm atmosphere that contrasts with the bright lights across the shore, which outshine even the stars. Lovers huddle by the sea, their soft whispers blending harmoniously with the low murmur of the waves, all enveloped in the gentle night breeze.

I seem to see Cinderella rushing into the darkness, the prince holding the glass slipper, his lake-blue eyes filled with loss. Later... later, I open my eyes, and the scene before me is bathed in a golden glow from the morning sun.

　　近在眼前
    施沁
    我在家一有空闲，就喜欢把脸贴在窗花格上，出神地望着外面如诗如画的自然景色。这时候，可以远眺对岸的灯光，可以近望临海的花园；可以沉思，可以默想。可我常常抛却了一切思绪，被眼前的景色迷惑着、镇慑着，久久回不过神来。
    海面上那片宽阔的天空，分分秒秒都在变化。时而一副简朴清爽的素描，时而一副水彩通透而流畅的笔触，有时则是凝重华美的油画。更让人叹为观止的是，夕阳余晖的一道道淡紫，整齐地撒在蓝天，两朵奇峰突起的黑云带着被烧红的边缘仍倔强地挡在火球的两边，一段橙红的烟霭氤氤氲氲地掩映着隔岸的山峰。而大雷雨前夕，深蓝的天空被乌雪怪兽迅速吞噬的情景，令人惊心动魄。
    海面出奇地平静，浪花跳耀着映照天空，在她的臂弯中托着白云的倩影。点点风帆乘风逐浪，滑翔在海天之际，在蓝白中点出鲜黄、猩红，摇落纷繁。高速公路架在沿岸的海面上，汽车、轮船结伴往来，络绎不绝。
    海滨花园玲珑剔透，是老人、小孩的乐园。而当夜幕降临，丁香花散着幽香，一派穹静而温馨的气氛与对岸灯火通明得连星星也失色的热闹恰成对比。情侣们相偎在海傍，莺莺细语与海涛的低鸣和谐地溶在海风的伴奏中，彼此被淡淡的夜色所包围。
    我仿佛看见灰姑娘匆匆奔向黑暗，王子手托水晶鞋，湖水蓝的眼中流露着失落。后来……后来，我睁开眼睛，眼前的景色已被朝霞镀上一层金色。
