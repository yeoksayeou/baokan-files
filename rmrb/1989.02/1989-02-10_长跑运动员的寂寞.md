The British novelist Alan Sillitoe published a novel titled "The Loneliness of the Long-Distance Runner" in 1959, which caused a sensation in the post-war British literary scene. The novel tells the story of a young man from a working-class background who, while in a reformatory, adopts a carefree attitude towards the authorities and societal traditions. The book was later adapted into a film and was also shown in China.

Thirty years later, I was reminded of this novel after reading an autobiography by the famous American left-wing sociologist Michael Harrington, also titled "The Long-Distance Runner." As the title suggests, the book naturally recounts his lifelong dedication to the socialist ideal. Whether the title is borrowed from Sillitoe's novel, the author does not explicitly state, but readers cannot help but draw parallels, as Harrington's old age as a socialist is indeed quite lonely.

Harrington initially joined the American socialist movement in the 1950s, a time when the post-war economic recovery and prosperity in America, along with the natural passing of the older generation of immigrant workers who brought socialist ideas from Europe and the middle-class and Americanization of their second and third generations, had led to a decline in the socialist movement. Many old leftists had turned to the new right. In this atmosphere of "peace and prosperity," Harrington stood out as a rare individual committed to the socialist movement and made theoretical contributions. For instance, his book "The Other America," which meticulously exposes the poverty hidden behind America's prosperity, caused a significant stir upon publication and eventually prompted President Kennedy to formulate a plan to eliminate poverty. In this sense, although Harrington was alone, he was not lonely.

However, in the 1970s, after the social unrest in America subsided with the end of the Vietnam War, the political, economic, and cultural trends in America underwent a second rightward shift since the end of World War II. The socialist movement that Harrington had dedicated himself to also fell into silence, and his works were neglected. Nowadays, bookstores are filled with biographies of "business heroes" like Jake Jacobs, Armand Hammer, and Lee Iacocca (once upon a time, their predecessors like Rockefeller and Ford were seen as "exploiters," and the changes in the world are indeed unpredictable) and bestsellers on how to start a business and get rich.

However, Harrington remains undeterred by loneliness. Despite being ill (he had esophageal cancer, which recurred after surgery), he not only wrote an autobiography to express his unwavering commitment to the socialist ideal but also began planning another book on democratic socialism. His ideal society is based on human rights and social justice, and he believes it will have relevance in post-Reagan America.

Michael Harrington is indeed a long-distance runner.

　　长跑运动员的寂寞
　　董乐山
    英国小说家阿伦·西利托曾在１９５９年出版一部长篇小说《长跑运动员的寂寞》，轰动了战后英国文坛。它写的是一个工人阶级子弟在教养所里以玩世不恭的态度对待当局和社会传统的心理和故事，后来曾拍成电影，在我国也放映过。
    ３０年后的今天使我想起这部小说，是由于最近读到了美国著名左派社会学家迈克·哈林顿的一本书名也叫《长跑运动员》的自传。顾名思义，这书讲的自然是他毕生致力于社会主义理想的坚持不渝的经历。至于书名是否套用西利托的小说，作者没有明言，但读者读了以后，难免发生联想，因为哈林顿作为社会主义者的老境确是十分孤寂的。
    哈林顿最初投身于美国社会主义运动已是战后的５０年代，当时由于美国战后经济恢复繁荣，加之原来把社会主义思想从欧洲带来的老一代移民工人的自然消亡以及他们的第二代、第三代的中产阶级化和美国化，社会主义运动至此已渐趋衰微，许多老左派纷纷转向为新右派。在这样的“太平盛世”的气氛中，哈林顿却有志于社会主义运动，并在理论上有所建树，彷如鹤立鸡群，确实不可多得。比如他以详尽确凿资料揭露美国繁荣的表面后存在贫困现象的《另外一个美国》，出版后曾造成一定反响，终于促使肯尼迪总统制订消灭贫困计划。从这一点来说，哈林顿尽管孤独，但并不寂寞。
    但是在７０年代美国社会动乱随着越南停战而平息以后，美国的政治、经济、文化总趋势在第二次世界大战后第二次趋向右转，哈林顿所致力的社会主义运动也随之归于沉寂，他的著作受到了冷落，如今书坊间多的是雅科卡、哈默、李·史密斯等“企业英雄”的传记（想当初他们的前辈洛克菲勒、福特等曾被视为“剥削大王”，世事变幻，真是莫测！）和传授经营管理起家发财之道的畅销书。
    但是哈林顿仍不甘寂寞，虽在病中（他患了食道癌，手术后又复发），不但写了一本自传，表明他对社会主义理想矢志不移的心迹，而且又在构思另一部阐述民主社会主义的专著。他的这个理想社会以人权和社会公正为宗旨，他认为在里根后的美国，会有它的针对意义。
    迈克·哈林顿不愧是个长跑运动员。
