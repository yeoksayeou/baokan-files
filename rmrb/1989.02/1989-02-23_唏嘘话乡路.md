My hometown has a path to the west, about two li long, intersecting with the north-south public road in a "T" shape. It lies across the land of my hometown and across my heart...

When I was young, it was a ditch, full of thistles, chicken dung grass, reeds, horse thorns, and rabbit grass... interspersed with wild flowers like daisies, bottle gourd flowers, and cat's-eye flowers... swaying in the wind, the entire ditch seemed like a dragon with golden scales dancing in the air; the green curtains on both sides rustled. The adults said there were wolves there, which had snatched away the daughters-in-law returning to their mothers' homes. So, we would take bright, gleaming sickles and go there in groups to cut grass and herd sheep, looking at the sky as blue as lapis lazuli and the pure white clouds like filtered milk drops, singing the rough, rustic folk songs:

“On the seventh of July, the eighth of August,
There was a daughter-in-law visiting her mother,
Walking through a field of corn,
She met a soldier...

Every time we sang to this point, I would turn back to look at Xiao Juan's face, red as the sun...

That year, the commune was building a production road. The bulldozers roared, the ditch was leveled, the road widened, and white poplars were planted on both sides, their leaves singing the folk tunes of the countryside. In the golden waves of wheat, a green avenue like a silver hairpin cutting open a Milky Way. I, a failed student, walked under the moonlight back from school, the moonlight filtering through the leaves, sprinkling countless little moons on the road, like clusters of flower waves rushing towards me, more passionate than an old friend I hadn't seen in a long time. I couldn't help but burst into a roar of Qing opera: “Liu Yanhua cries with tears in his eyes, holding his beloved little Chen Xiang...” My hair stood on end, and the sound was stirring. The frustration of failing and the long-term gloom were released, and my body instantly gained more vitality. After that, I was admitted to a university. Xiao Juan sent me off at the village entrance under the persimmon tree, her face pale as the moon. Father stood by the road to see me off, leaning on his hoe, saying: “The road must be repaired continuously to be smooth; the tree must be pruned continuously to grow tall...” Seeing Father's bald head, hunched back, and bent legs, my nose stung, and tears welled up in my eyes. This scene pressed on my heart like a millstone. In school, I dared not be lazy for a moment, became a three-good student, joined the party, and wrote some printable square characters. When I started working, that scene often flashed before my eyes.

In recent years, a high-level rest and recuperation center was built in the middle of the road. The road in my hometown was widened again, with enough space for three carriages to drive side by side. Cement was laid on the road surface, all the way from the high-level rest and recuperation center to the north-south asphalt road. Cars rolled out of the high walls like fireballs, speeding on the smooth cement road, leaving behind a series of romantic pop songs that made one's spirit soar. At sunset, the old cadres would stroll out of the gate, scattered in threes and twos in the fields, watching the soaring eagles; listening to the faint songs of crickets, grasshoppers, cicadas, and locusts... leaving the wide road to the next generation, who wore red and green, arm in arm, exchanging feelings. My hometown's road radiated the vibrant modern atmosphere.

But the other half of the road connecting my hometown? There were no more flowers weaving a dancing golden dragon; no more tree leaves singing in the evening sun and breeze; no more Xiao Juan with a heart as hot as the sun and as gentle as the moon. I heard she married to a place very far from me, unknown to me. On her wedding day, she cried loudly, and everyone on the road stopped to weep...

There were only deep ruts filled with black water; only long piles of garbage from the city, like giant snakes, breeding white worms, winding around ugly, half-cut tree stumps that could trip people, surging onto the bumpy “road surface.” My hometown's half of the road has become a muddy river, and my fellow villagers who trudge through it, what is their situation!

My hometown's road has been divided into two, like a noble princess and a ragged Cinderella. The stark contrast in this intersecting area is strongly striking the hearts of passersby...

Dreaming of the paths of my nostalgic hometown...

　　唏嘘话乡路
    辛建斌
    我的故乡向西有条路，二里些许，与南北走向的公路线交成“丁”字状。她横卧在故乡的土地上，也横卧在我的心头……
    我小时候，她是条沟，坡坡坎坎长满了刺蓟草、鸡粪蒿、芦苇草、马刺草、狗尾巴草……夹杂着打碗花、麦瓶瓶花、猫儿眼花……随风摇曳，整个沟身就似身镶金鳞的飞龙翩翩起舞；两边的青纱帐沙沙作响。大人们讲，那里有狼，把回娘家的小媳妇都叼去了。于是，我们就执著明晃晃的镰刀成群结伙地去那里割草、牧羊，看那瓦蓝瓦蓝的天空和像过滤过的纯净的奶滴似的白云，唱那粗犷的乡俗野调：
    “七月七、八月八，
    有一个媳妇熬娘家，
    走过一片高梁地，
    碰见一个当兵的……
    每每唱到这儿，我就回头去看小娟子那红得像太阳的脸庞……
    那年，公社大修生产路。推土机嘟嘟嘟地叫着，沟平了，路宽了，两旁植起白杨，树叶儿奏起乡间小唱。金黄的麦浪里，一条绿荫大道似银簪划开的一道天河。我这个落榜生踏着月色从母校复课归来，月光透过树叶，给路上撒下无数的小月花，似一簇簇的花潮向我涌来，比久别邂逅的老友还要热烈，我便有点不能自持，憋足吃奶的劲，吼一段秦腔：“刘彦昌哭得两眼泪汪汪，怀抱着娇儿小——陈——香……”须发竖立，荡气回肠。落榜的晦气、长久的郁闷发泄出来，浑身霎时添了不少精气。之后，我考上了大学，小娟子在村口柿子树下为我送行，脸白煞煞地像月亮。父亲在路边为我送行，他拄着铁锨说：“这路要不停地修，才能平；这树要不断地掰去丫，才能长高……”看着父亲谢顶的头、佝偻的腰、罗着的腿，我鼻子酸了，泪珠儿在眼眶里打转转。此情此景像磨盘一样从此压在我的心上。在学校，我不敢有一丝倦怠，当了三好学生，入了党，写了一些能铅印的方块字。走上工作岗位，当时的一幕还常常闪现于我的眼前。
    近几年，路中央处，修建了高干疗养所。故乡的路又拓展了，大有三辆马车并驾齐驱之势。水泥铺了路面，一直从高干所门口铺到南北走向的柏油公路。一辆辆小轿车火球般地从高墙宅院滚出，飞驶在平光光的水泥路面上，并丢下一阵阵令人神魂颠倒的浪漫流行曲。残阳如血的时辰，老干部们就踱出大门，三三两两地散落于田间地头，望飞翔的苍鹰；听蝼蛄、蟋蟀、纺织娘、蝉、蚂蚱那微弱的歌声永恒的歌唱……则把平阔的大道给了穿红挂绿、勾肩搭背的一对对交流情感的下一代，故乡这段路放射着五彩缤纷的现代气息。
    而连接故乡的那一半路哪？再也没有了鲜花编织成的翩翩起舞的金龙；没有了夕照下、微风里树叶儿吱吱铃铃的歌唱；没有了热情似太阳、柔情似月亮的小娟子，听说她嫁到一个不为我所知的很遥远的地方去了，结婚那天，她嚎啕恸哭，满路的人都驻足恸心……
    有的只是积满黑水的深深的车辙；有的只是从城市吐出的巨蟒似的长长的垃圾堆，滋生着一条一条白色的虫子，一疙瘩一疙瘩的绕过能绊倒人的粗黑的丑陋的半节树桩，涌上坑坑洼洼的“路面”。故乡的这半段路成了污浊的小河，跋涉于其中的我的父老乡亲们又是怎样的情形啊！
    故乡的路被截成了两个，似华贵的公主与褴褛的灰姑娘，这交插地带的鲜明的反差对比，在强烈地叩击着过路者的心灵……
    梦回神绕的故乡的路哟……
