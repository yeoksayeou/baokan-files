The "Heart-to-Heart Pavilion" column in Guangdong Province's "Family" magazine receives a lot of letters from readers every day. Some readers even write about their personal secrets in detail, seeking guidance. The editors of this column are truly dedicated, responding to every letter.

This publication is far-sighted. The field of social psychological counseling is quite developed in advanced countries. With the influence of diverse cultures, people are provided with multiple value judgment standards, leading to a "double bind" mentality where people fear getting trapped in spiritual labyrinths they create themselves, resulting in more psychological barriers. We are currently in a specific historical period of transitioning from old to new systems, where conflicts between old and new ideas bring trouble, confusion, and unease to many people. The conflicts between good and bad in people's daily lives, as well as psychological conflicts when faced with equal benefits, can all put people in a dilemma. If these psychological issues are not treated promptly and effectively, they can in turn affect a person's mood and even the stability and harmony of society.

The key content of psychological counseling is not in preaching, but in guiding. As the saying goes, "One key opens one lock." For people with various psychological barriers, grand theories may not be convincing, and political education may not fully solve the problem. However, a few heartfelt words from a trusted friend can open the heart and bring clarity. Therefore, psychological counseling is essentially a fusion of hearts based on understanding and trust. Doing this well requires both a solid knowledge foundation and a sincere heart.

The "Heart-to-Heart Pavilion" set up by "Family" has a good influence. If our newspapers, enterprises, and institutions set up more "Heart-to-Heart Pavilions," that would be even better!

### 从“谈心亭”谈起

　　从“谈心亭”谈起
    许锦根
    广东省的《家庭》杂志有个栏目叫“谈心亭”，每天收到很多读者来信，来信者甚至把自己的隐私也原原本本地写在信中，请求指点迷津。该栏的编辑也真尽职，每信必复。
    这家刊物是有远见卓识的。社会心理咨询事业如今在发达国家开展得比较普遍，多元文化向世人提供了多元的价值判断标准，于是，人们大小事都害怕陷入“两难”心理，陷入自造的精神迷宫，心理障碍也就多了起来。我们现正处在新旧体制转轨特定历史时期，新旧观念的冲突，给不少人带来烦恼、困惑和不安。人们日常生活中遇到的一些属于善与非善的冲突，以及在两种均等利益面前的心理冲突，都会使人处于两难之中。而这些心理上的毛病如不能得到及时有效的治疗，又会反过来影响人的情绪，甚至影响社会的安定团结。
    心理咨询的重要内容，不在于说教，而在于疏导。俗话说“一把钥匙开一把锁”，对于有这样或那样心理障碍的人，大道理未必说得通，政治教育未必能彻底解决问题，而知心朋友说几句知心话，却可能启开心扉，使人豁然开朗。因此，心理咨询实际是在理解和信任基础上的心与心的交融。做好这件事，既需要有深厚的知识功底，又需要有一颗赤诚的心。
    《家庭》设了个“谈心亭”，影响很好。要是我们的报刊、企事业单位设立更多的“谈心亭”，那就更好了！
