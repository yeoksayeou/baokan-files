    Another major achievement in veterinary medicine: Monoclonal antibodies to solve the problem of equine infectious anemia

    Our reporter He Huangbiao reports: Following the development of the equine infectious anemia vaccine in China, another major scientific research achievement—monoclonal antibodies—has been successfully created by the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences Harbin Veterinary Research Institute.

    Experts unanimously evaluate that this antibody has strong specificity and high sensitivity, and will play an important role in improving diagnostic technology, eliminating the source of infection, purifying the horse population, and further controlling equine infectious anemia. It is another major breakthrough after the successful development of the equine infectious anemia vaccine, reaching an advanced international level.

    When humans or animals are infected with pathogenic microorganisms and develop infectious diseases, the body can produce humoral and cellular immune responses to combat the infection. To prevent infectious diseases through vaccination, the body can also produce an immune response. Therefore, distinguishing between serum antibodies from strong viral infections and those from vaccinations has become one of the challenges that various countries are trying to overcome.

    To solve the problem of whether a horse has equine infectious anemia or has been vaccinated with the equine infectious anemia donkey white blood cell attenuated vaccine, the scientific and technological personnel of the Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, through painstaking exploration, used hybridoma technology to develop a monoclonal antibody A4 that is specific to the equine infectious anemia vaccine strain. They also created an enzyme-linked reagent for use in the immune dot test DB. Horses with positive serum reactions have been vaccinated; those with negative reactions are further tested using the immune diffusion test. A positive reaction indicates the horse has equine infectious anemia. This method is simple to operate and easy to promote.

### 我国兽医学又一成果　单克隆抗体能解决马传贫病难题

　　我国兽医学又一成果
　　单克隆抗体能解决马传贫病难题
    本报讯  记者何黄彪报道：继我国马传贫疫苗问世之后，又一项重大科研成果——单克隆抗体，由中国农科院哈尔滨兽医研究所首创成功。
    对此，专家们一致的评价是：该抗体特异性强，敏感性高，对提高诊断技术水平、清除疫源、净化马群、进一步控制马传贫将起重要作用，是继马传贫疫苗研制成功后的又一重大突破，处于国际先进水平。
    当人或动物因感染病原微生物发生传染病的时候，机体能产生抗感染的体液免疫和细胞免疫反应。为了预防传染病进行疫苗接种，此时机体也同样能产生免疫应答反应。因此，区分强毒感染与疫苗接种的血清抗体，这个问题已成为各国力图攻克的难题之一。
    为了解决是马传染性贫血病马，还是马传贫驴白细胞弱毒疫苗马的问题，哈尔滨兽医研究所的科技人员经过刻苦探索，采用生物工程杂交瘤技术，研制出具有马传贫疫苗株系特异性的单克隆抗体Ａ４，并制成酶联试剂用于免疫斑点试验ＤＢ。受检马血清呈阳性反应为注射过疫苗马；其检查为阴性的血清，再作免疫扩散试验，呈现阳性反应为马传贫病马。这种方法操作简便，极易推广。
