Nearly forty years with the chisel

Famous sculptor Liu Huanzhang holds another exhibition of his works

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 13th

(Reporter Yin Hongzhu) Following the successful holding of his first exhibition eight years ago, sculptor Liu Huanzhang today once again presents his 50-plus recent works at the China Art Museum for the audience.

Some artists believe that Liu Huanzhang's works in this exhibition reflect his new artistic pursuits: the simplicity and refinement of his expressive techniques, and the depth of his ideas and philosophies, all leave a deep impression on people.

Currently a researcher at the Sculpture Creation Research Institute of the Central Academy of Fine Arts and a member of the Chinese Artists Association, Liu Huanzhang has been working with the chisel for nearly 40 years, diligently creating a large number of excellent works. He has also held personal exhibitions in some countries and regions and has published several collections of sculptures. Zhou Peiyuan and art world figures Liu Kaituo, Hua Junwu, Wang Chaowen, and Jin Shangyi attended this exhibition, which was organized by the Chinese Artists Association.

　　近四十年与刻刀为伴    
    著名雕塑家刘焕章再次举办作品展
    新华社北京２月１３日电  （记者尹鸿祝）继８年前成功地举办了第一次作品展之后，雕塑家刘焕章今天再度于中国美术馆将他的５０余件近作奉献给观众。
    一些美术家认为，刘焕章这次展出的作品体现了他艺术上新的追求：表现手法的简洁、洗炼，意趣和哲理的表达，都给人留下深刻印象。
    现任中央美术学院雕塑创作研究所研究员、中国美协理事的刘焕章，至今已和刻刀结伴近４０年，辛勤创作了大量的优秀作品。他还曾赴一些国家和地区举办个人作品展，并有多种雕塑集出版。周培源和美术界名人刘开渠、华君武、王朝闻、靳尚谊等参观了由中国美术家协会主办的这次展览。
