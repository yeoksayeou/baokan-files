	Protecting Lawyers and Citizens' Rights
	The Soviet Union Establishes a Lawyers' Union

	According to a report by the *Izvestiya* on February 26, the Soviet Lawyers' Union was recently established in Moscow. It is an independent social organization and does not belong to any department.

	Representatives from 150 lawyer collectives across the Soviet Union, totaling 500 people, attended the founding conference. Voskresensky, the chairman of the Moscow City Lawyers' Association, was elected as the chairman of the Soviet Lawyers' Union.

	In the Soviet Union, existing lawyer collectives, although they are social organizations, are led by the Soviet Ministry of Justice and local authorities and cannot function effectively. Lawyers sometimes do not receive adequate protection. The newly established Soviet Lawyers' Union will, on an independent basis, unite lawyers across the country, protect the rights of lawyers, and protect the rights of citizens for whom they defend.

　　保护律师和公民的权利
    苏成立律师联合会
    新华社莫斯科２月２６日电  据《消息报》２６日报道，苏联律师联合会最近在莫斯科成立，它不隶属于任何部门，是一个独立的社会组织。
    苏联１５０个律师集体的５００名代表参加了成立大会。莫斯科市律师协会主席团主席沃斯克列先斯基当选为苏联律师联合会主席。
    在苏联，现有的律师集体虽然是社会组织，但受苏联司法部和地方机构的领导，不能很好地发挥作用，律师有时也得不到保护。新成立的苏联律师联合会将在独立的基础上联合全国的律师，保护律师的权利，并保护为之辩护的公民的权利。
