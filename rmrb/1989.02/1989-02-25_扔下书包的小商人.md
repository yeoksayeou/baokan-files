Several years ago, young people from Zhejiang set up tofu stalls near the government offices in Harbin, easing the difficulties local residents had in buying tofu. Subsequently, they crossed the Gobi Desert, introducing southern-style tofu to Urumqi. The active figures in every corner of China, such as cotton carders, umbrella and shoe repairers, as well as those frying youtiao and selling wontons, are mostly young merchants from the Jiangsu and Zhejiang regions. They did not leave their hometowns just to seek sustenance. In their hometowns in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, they could all live comfortably. However, the saying "Education is useful, but education without money" has become increasingly popular in these regions where the commodity economy is developed. The number of people applying for higher-level schools has significantly decreased. Taking Jin Hua County in Zhejiang Province as an example, a few years ago, almost all junior high school students applied for senior high school. In 1988, only 52.5% of junior high school students applied for further education.

The young merchants from Jiangsu and Zhejiang, riding the wave of reform and opening up, with their courage, the wisdom passed down by their ancestors, and their hardworking hands, have traversed the entire country. They are full of vitality from the commodity economy and should leave a chapter in the history of the development of the commodity economy in these few years. However, they are still middle and primary school students, and some are even illiterate. Their energy should be mainly focused on their studies. The country does not hope that a group of illiterates and schoolchildren will develop the commodity economy. They should return to the classroom.

		The Beijing Vegetable Girl

In the early morning of summer, when the elderly in Beijing who wake up the earliest are just starting to practice Tai Chi, a frail young girl is already struggling to pedal a tricycle loaded with vegetables, beginning her day's business in a residential area in Chaoyang District. When her peers are still sleeping in their parents' arms, she has already sold a tricycle full of cucumbers and tomatoes, and now she is counting her money, showing a tired smile on her face. After a morning market, earning 10 or 8 yuan is no problem, and she only needs to spend 2 jiao to buy a youtiao to eat, the rest is pure profit. The tax collector will come in the morning, and by then she can earn a few more yuan. She is quite clever, so although the morning market is tiring, she never misses it.

In 1987, when she first appeared in the agricultural market, she really startled the adults in Beijing. That year, she was only 12 years old, not very tall, with a yellowish face and a pair of cunning little eyes, wearing a set of coarse cloth clothes, and speaking in a Su Bei accent. Gradually, she became familiar with the customers, and people called her "Little Girl," to which she responded enthusiastically.

"Little Girl, how many years of school have you attended?"

"I've never been to school, I don't recognize a single character."

People didn't believe it, that a clever and capable little girl was actually illiterate. A customer brought a pen and paper, asking her to write her name. This time she was really in trouble; the hand that weighed the scale couldn't hold a pen. Her little fellow villager wrote her name on the paper: Wang Chunxiang.

Wang Chunxiang also has moments that make people feel sorry for her. When there are fewer customers at noon, others can take out an old newspaper or magazine and get some spiritual enjoyment from it. But she doesn't recognize a single character, she has nothing to do, and her only joy is counting her money.

In late January 1989, she returned to her hometown for the New Year with a full load, bringing back several thousand yuan to her family and teaching her fellow villagers the way to make money by selling vegetables in Beijing. However, she didn't learn a single more character.

		The Big Shot from the Poor Mountain Valley

On a construction site in the poor and backward Lvliang region of Shanxi, a group of idle locals squat on the ground, watching a group of young men from the south work on a water conservancy project. It can be said without exaggeration that this is "the poor watching the rich work."

Someone asked the mountain people, "Why do you hire outsiders to take on your own projects, giving them the money to earn?"

"We don't know how," the mountain people answered honestly.

The Zhejiang people working there chuckled to themselves. Who would have thought that most of them had never done this kind of work, and some had never even seen such water conservancy projects unique to the northern mountains. They just relied on their courage to learn as they went. Observing closely, these young men were only seventeen or eighteen years old, their bodies as slender as bean sprouts, and they were a group of dropouts who had left school to work.

Xing County, a revolutionary base. In the 1940s, it was a necessary passage from North China to Yan'an. More than 40 years have passed, and the transportation here is still backward, with little change. In the 1980s, the young shoemakers from Zhejiang, carrying their shoe boxes and holding a tattered map of China, traveled and worked, coming to this remote village, of course, earning money was not a small matter, and they also learned a lot of knowledge that was not in the books.

Where to go next? They had already planned it: cross the Yellow River, go to Yan'an. A young shoemaker joked, "Go to Yan'an to join the revolution." Their actions were somewhat similar to the Red Guards' mass travel in the 1960s, but what they pursued was completely different. Their pioneering spirit and ability to support themselves are something that the pampered only children in big cities can only dream of.

		He Dreams of Becoming Ho Eng Tong

The Zhang brothers rent a house in Beijing's Jiu Xian Bridge to grind tofu. The eldest and second brothers are junior high school graduates who came out earlier. In the early 1980s, they came to Beijing and earned more than 200 yuan a month, which was quite good at the time. With a tofu grinder, the two brothers renovated their old house.

One day, the third brother, who was still in junior high school, suddenly followed his fellow villagers from Wenling, Zhejiang, to Beijing to find his older brothers. The older brother scolded him, "What are you running out for? Why don't you stay at home and study properly?" "Just because you can come out, I can't?" The third brother was not convinced. The third brother insisted on not going back, so the older brother let him come out to sell tofu.

Although the third brother had not graduated from junior high school, his cultural knowledge far exceeded that of his two older brothers. He wrote beautiful calligraphy, and under the tofu-selling basket, he stuffed it with books and newspapers. He sold tofu while reading. I am his old customer, and after a long time, we became friends. Every time I see him, I always advise him to go back to his hometown to finish junior high school. He told me his thoughts:

"My grades are very good, and in our hometown, I am considered a top student. But in our place, students my age have all run out, and those who stay at home are looked down upon as having no future."

The third brother was blown out by a business wind. This young man with great ideals has a deep-seated goal in his heart: "to become Ho Eng Tong." He said, "Ho Eng Tong is only a junior high school graduate, and now he is a billionaire in Hong Kong. We, this group of students who go out to do business, all want to become billionaires."

The commodity economy in Wenling County has produced a group of young people who dream of becoming Ho Eng Tong, which should be said to be the result of people's changing attitudes. But I told him, "Ho Eng Tong does not hope that young people will drop out of school to do business. He has donated a lot of money for education. The times have changed. Now, if you don't study, you won't become a billionaire in the future." "After I have a lot of money, I will also be like Ho Eng Tong." He said.

After 1987, the Zhang brothers disappeared, perhaps they went to do bigger business, or perhaps they made a lot of money and went back to study.

Jiangsu and Zhejiang have always been regions in China with developed education and culture. It is precisely because the people here have a good quality that a group of smart and capable young merchants have emerged. Wang Chunxiang and the third brother of the Zhang family are undoubtedly a group of young people with high intelligence. If they had solid cultural and scientific knowledge, perhaps they would really become "Ho Eng Tong" in a few decades.

The social reason for dropping out of school to do business is that in the early stage of the development of the commodity economy, people are eager to get rich, which leads to this situation. In terms of education itself, a considerable part of junior high school teaching quality is poor, and students have no hope of further education after graduation, nor can they learn real job skills, which also prompts some students to enter society early. With the development of the economy, the improvement of people's living standards, and the deepening of educational reform, young merchants will gradually decrease. During my visit to South China Normal University, I was delighted to see that some individual businessmen from the Pearl River Delta region with millions of dollars in their pockets are enrolling in universities at their own expense. Individual businessmen who have already graduated hang their diplomas in the center of their shops to gain social credibility with their education. They do not think that "education is useless," on the contrary, they think that "education is useful."

The day when the young merchants from Jiangsu and Zhejiang pick up their schoolbags again will surely come!

　　扔下书包的小商人    
    ●他们的同龄人正坐在教室里
    ●他们离开江浙老家走南闯北
    ●他们将如何选择今天和明天
    本报记者  蒋涵箴
    几年前，浙江小青年在哈尔滨市政府附近摆开了豆腐摊，缓解了当地居民吃豆腐难的矛盾。尔后，他们又穿过戈壁滩，把南豆腐引进乌鲁木齐。活跃在中国每一个角落里的弹棉花师傅、修伞、修鞋匠，乃至炸油条、卖馄饨的大都是来自江浙一带的小商人。他们并非为了寻求温饱而远离家乡。在江浙老家，他们都可以过上温饱有余的日子。然而，“读书有用，但读书无钱”的说法在江浙商品经济发达的地区日趋流行。这些地区要求报考高一级学校的人数明显减少。以浙江省金华县为例，几年之前绝大部分初中生都要报考高中，１９８８年只有５２．５％的初中生要求升学。
    江浙小商人，趁开放、搞活的大潮，凭自己的胆量，用祖先留给他们的智慧，靠勤劳的双手，足迹踏遍了全中国。他们全身都充满了商品经济的活力，在这几年商品经济的发展史上应该留下他们的一个篇章。可是，他们毕竟是中、小学生，有的甚至是文盲，他们的精力主要应该放在学习上，国家也不希望一批文盲、小学生去发展商品经济。他们应该回到课堂上去。
    　　　　京城卖菜女
    夏日晨曦，北京起得最早的老人刚刚摆开架势打太极拳，一个瘦弱的小姑娘已经吃力地蹬着平板三轮车，在朝阳区某个居民楼群里开始了她一天的经商生涯。当她的同龄人尚在父母身旁酣睡时，她已经把一车黄瓜、西红柿卖完了，此刻她正在清点钞票，脸上露出了疲倦的笑容。一个早市下来，挣个１０元、８元没问题，而她只要拿出２毛钱买油条吃，其余都是纯收入。收税的老头要到上午才来，到那时她又可挣来好几元。她的脑袋瓜子相当灵，所以早市虽辛苦，她从不放过。
    １９８７年她第一次出现在农贸市场时，着实使北京的大人们吓了一大跳。那年她只有１２岁，个头儿不高，蜡黄的脸上镶嵌着一双狡黠的小眼睛，穿一身土布衣服，说一口苏北话。渐渐地她和顾客们混熟了，人们都称她“小丫头”，她答应得相当痛快。
    “小丫头，你上了几年学？”
    “没进过校门，一个字也不认得。”
    人们不相信，聪明能干的小丫头居然是个大文盲。一位顾客拿来笔和纸，让她写自己的名字。这下可难为她了，使秤的小手不会握笔，她的小同乡在纸上写下了“小丫头”的大名：王春香。
    王春香也有让人感到可怜的时候。中午顾客稀少了，别人都拿张旧报纸、旧杂志，从中得到一些精神享受。可她一个字也不认得，她无事可做，唯一的乐趣就是点她的钞票。
    １９８９年１月下旬，她满载而归回老家过年了，她不仅给她家里带回数千元人民币，而且还向她的乡亲们传授了在京城卖菜的生财之道。然而却没有多识一个字。
    　　　　穷山沟里来了大能人
    在晋西北贫穷落后的吕梁地区的一个工地上，一群闲得发慌的本地人蹲在地上看着一群南方来的小伙子修水利工程。可以毫不夸张地说，这是“穷人在看着富人干活”。
    有人问山里人：“你们自己的工程为什么要请外地人来承包，这钱不就给他们挣去了吗？”
    “鹅（我）不会。”山里人回答得很实在。
    正在干活的浙江人听了暗暗地笑了。真是天晓得，他们之中大部分人都没有干过这活，甚至连见都没有见过这种北方山区特有的水利工程，不就是凭着一身胆量边干边学嘛。细细观察，这群小伙子有的只有十七八岁，身材像豆芽菜一样尚未发起来，他们是一批辍学打工的初中生。
    兴县，革命老根据地。４０年代，这里是华北通往延安的必经之地。４０多年过去了，这里的交通仍然落后，变化不大。８０年代的浙江小鞋匠身背鞋箱，拿着一本破烂的中国地图，边打工、边旅游，来到这个穷乡僻壤，当然挣钱也不少，并且学到了许多书本上没有的知识。
    下一站上哪儿？他们已计划齐全：过黄河、赴延安。一位小鞋匠俏皮地说：“到延安去参加革命。”他们的行动与６０年代红卫兵大串连有某种相似，而所追求的却截然不同。他们的开拓精神，自食其力的能力是大城市里那些娇生惯养的独生子女望尘莫及的。
    　　　　他梦想成为霍英东
    张氏三兄弟在北京酒仙桥租屋磨豆腐。老大老二是初中毕业生，出来得比较早。８０年代初期来到北京，一月挣２００多元，在当时是相当不错了。靠着一部磨豆腐机，两兄弟把老家的房子更新了。
    一天，正在读初中的老三突然跟着浙江温岭的老乡来到北京找哥哥。哥哥责问他：“你跑出来干吗？不在家好好读书？”“就准你们出来，我就不能出来？”老三不服气。老三硬是不肯回去，哥哥就让他出来卖豆腐。
    老三尽管初中尚未毕业，可文化知识大大超过两位哥哥。他写得一手漂亮的钢笔字，卖豆腐的竹筐下塞满了书报。他是边卖豆腐边读书。我是他的老主顾，日子久了，我们就成了忘年之交。每次遇见他，我都要劝他回老家去把初中读完。他向我说出了心里话：
    “我的功课非常好，在老家也算得上是一名尖子学生。可是在我们那儿像我这样大的学生都跑出来了，剩下的人就无心读书了，守在家里的人被人看作是没有出息。”
    老三是被一股经商风刮出来的。这个富有理想的少年内心深处有着一个目标：“成为霍英东”。他说：“霍英东也不过是初中文化水平，他现在是香港的大富翁，我们这批出门做生意的学生都想成为一个大富翁。”
    商品经济发达的温岭县造就了一批梦想当霍英东的少年，这应该说是人们观念变化之后的心态。但是，我对他说：“霍英东先生并不希望青少年辍学经商，他为办教育捐助了不少钱。时代不同了，现在不读书，以后成不了大富翁。”“等我有了许许多多钱之后也会像霍英东一样的。”他说。
    １９８７年之后，张氏兄弟就销声匿迹了，也许他们去从事更大的买卖，也许他们钱赚多了回家读书去了。
    江浙一带历来是我国教育、文化发达的地区，正因为这里的人素质好，所以才能出现一批精明能干的小商人。王春香、张家老三无疑都是一批智商较高的少年，如果他们具备了扎实的文化科学知识，几十年之后也许真会成为“霍英东”。
    辍学经商究其社会原因是商品经济发展初期，人们急于求富而造成的。就教育本身来说，相当一部分初中教学质量差，学生毕业后升学无望，又学不到就业的真本事，也促使一些学生早日走上社会。随着经济的发展，人民生活水平的提高，教学改革的深入，小商人也将逐步减少。记者在华南师范大学采访，欣喜地看到珠江三角洲地区一些腰缠万贯的个体户纷纷自费上大学。已经毕业的个体户学生，把自己的毕业文凭挂在店中央，以自己的学历来取得社会的信誉。他们并不认为“读书无用”，恰恰相反，倒是认为“读书有用”。
    江浙小商人重新背上书包这一天迟早会到来的！
