The suburb of Beijing, Nankanjie Village in Fangshan, which was a red flag in the Beijing agricultural system during the 1950s and 1960s, has achieved a ton-per-mu grain yield for seven consecutive years since 1982, exceeding the national procurement task by 4.2 times. The village has hired experts from the Beijing Agricultural College to guide production, trained more than 20 "technological farmers," and established an agricultural technology service team. The entire village applies the "crop leaf age index control and promotion method," sprays triacontanol, changes from three crops in three seasons to flat seeding without ridges, increasing the effective planting area by 16.7%. All grain fields are fully seeded with superior varieties and irrigated by spraying.

　　京郊房山南韩继村连续七年亩产吨粮
    本报北京２月２３日讯  五六十年代北京市农业系统的一面红旗——房山区南韩继村，自１９８２年以来连年亩产吨粮，７年超过国家征购任务的４．２倍。该村聘请北京农学院专家指导生产，培养出２０多名“科技型农民”，建立农业科技服务队。全村应用“作物叶龄指数控促法”、喷施三十烷醇新技术，改三种三收为无畦平播，使土地有效种植面积增加１６．７％。粮田全部优种化、喷灌化。
