NATO welcomes Warsaw Pact's release of conventional force comparison figures
but believes "both sides' forces are roughly equal" claim is not realistic

	NATO on the 30th welcomed the Warsaw Pact's 29th release of East-West conventional force comparison report, but emphasized that the report's claim of "both sides' forces are roughly equal" does not match the actual situation.

	The NATO spokesperson stated in a release: "The Warsaw Pact has finally released detailed figures on conventional forces in Europe. NATO allies have long demanded that the Warsaw Pact take this step."

	He said: "NATO will investigate all the details of the information provided by the Warsaw Pact. However, 'the claim that both sides' forces are roughly equal' is not in line with the actual situation,' and 'the Soviet Union admits that it has a 2:1 advantage in the number of tanks and a 3:2 advantage in the number of armored vehicles.'"

	The spokesperson pointed out: "The extremely imbalanced situation in key weapon categories is the central issue of our concerns about European security." He said, "In the negotiations on conventional forces in Europe, we will urgently demand the elimination of imbalances that are detrimental to stability and security, as such imbalances, as a form of advantage, have the capability of sudden attacks and large-scale invasions."

	The Warsaw Pact released detailed figures on conventional military forces in Europe for the first time on the 29th, as a response to NATO's release of European conventional force comparison figures in November of last year. Although the figures released by both sides are contradictory, NATO still believes that this is a step towards military openness in Europe. It is also a preparation for the negotiations on the reduction of conventional armaments in Europe, which are scheduled to be held in Vienna in March.

　　北约欢迎华约公布常规力量对比数字
    但认为“双方力量大致相等”说法不合实际
    新华社布鲁塞尔１月３１日电北约３０日对华约２９日公布的东西方常规力量对比报告表示欢迎，但强调指出，报告中提出的“双方力量大致相等”的说法不符合实际情况。
    北约发言人在一项声明中说：“华约终于公布了在欧洲常规力量的详细数字。北约盟国长期以来一直要求华约采取这一步骤。”
    他说：北约将调查华约所提供情况的所有细节。但是“无论如何，双方力量大致相等的说法是与实际情况不符的”，“苏联承认在坦克数量上以２比１的比例占优势，在装甲车的数量上以３比２占优势。”
    发言人指出：“在关键性武器范围内存在的极大不均衡现象成为我们对欧洲安全担忧的中心问题。”他说，“在欧洲常规力量谈判中，我们将迫切要求清除不利于稳定与安全的不均衡现象，因为这种不均衡作为一种优势，具有突然袭击和采取大规模入侵行动的能力”。
    华约２９日首次公布了在欧洲常规军事力量的详细数字，作为对北约去年１１月份公布欧洲常规力量对比数字的反应。虽然双方公布的数字有矛盾，但北约仍然认为这是朝着欧洲军事开放的方向迈出了一步。并为即将在３月份召开的维也纳削减欧洲常规军备的谈判作准备。
