Gu Cheng County Guides Farmers to Establish New Customs
Formerly Burdened by "Social Debts," Today Frugally Handling Weddings and Funerals

New China News Agency, Wuhan, February 8 — (Reporters Shi Yongfeng and Correspondent Chen Huiming) The county committee and government of Gu Cheng, Hubei Province, have established regulations to free farmers from the pressure of extravagant weddings and funerals. In the past year, the average cost of weddings and funerals for over 90,000 households in the county has been reduced by more than 200 yuan per household compared to the past. These savings have been used 80% of the time for agricultural production.

In recent years, commodity production in Gu Cheng County's rural areas has developed significantly. Farmers' material living standards have improved, but some feudal remnants and outdated customs have resurfaced, especially the trend of extravagant weddings and funerals. A single wedding or funeral can cost hundreds to thousands of yuan, depleting several years' worth of savings, and some farmers have accumulated significant debts as a result. According to a sample survey, the amount farmers in this county spend on extravagant weddings and funerals in a year is equivalent to twice their investment in agriculture. Most farmers detest the increasingly heavy "social debts" but are forced to comply due to social pressure.

Starting from the beginning of last year, the Gu Cheng County Committee and Government proposed the goal of "purifying the rural living environment and fundamentally changing social customs." They launched a campaign to promote new customs in the entire rural area of the county. The county established 409 new custom promotion committees and 2,045 guidance groups. Based on the current rural living conditions, production, and the public's psychological tolerance, they formulated the "New Wedding Regulations" and "Simple Funeral Regulations." Under the premise of respecting local customs, they promoted 10 replacement methods in the county, such as replacing wasteful and vulgar wedding ceremonies with frugal and innovative ones, replacing large banquets with movie screenings, and replacing burning paper money and setting off firecrackers with flower offerings and tree planting for funerals.

　　谷城县引导农民树立新风俗
　　昔日困于“人情债”，今朝节俭办婚丧
    新华社武汉２月８日电  （记者施勇峰、通讯员陈惠明）湖北省谷城县委、县政府通过建章立制，把农民从大操大办“人情债”的压力下解脱出来。近一年来，全县９万多农户婚丧嫁娶的操办费用每户平均比过去减少２００多元，这些节省下来的钱有８０％直接用于农业生产。
    谷城县近几年来农村商品生产有了较大发展。农民的物质生活水平有了一定的提高，但一些封建残余和旧俗陋习却重新抬头，特别是大操大办之风日趋升级。农民办一宗红白事，少则几百元，多则数千元，一次就要耗尽几年的积累，有的为此债台高筑。据抽样调查，这个县农民一年用于大操大办的费用，相当于对农业投入的２倍。大多数农民对日益沉重的“人情债”深恶痛绝，但迫于风气的压力又不得不为之。
    从去年年初开始，谷城县委、县政府提出了“净化农村生活环境，从根本上转变社会风气”的奋斗目标，在全县农村广泛开展移风易俗活动。全县建立了４０９个移风易俗理事会，２０４５个疏导小组。他们根据当前农村生活、生产和群众心理承受能力，制订了《婚事新办规定》、《丧事简办规定》，在尊重民俗的前提下，在全县推广了用节俭、新颖的婚嫁仪式取代浪费、庸俗的婚嫁仪式，用放电影庆贺代替大办酒席，办丧事用献花植树代替烧纸钱放鞭炮等１０个方面的取代方法。
