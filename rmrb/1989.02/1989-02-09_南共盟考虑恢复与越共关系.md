The League of Communists of Yugoslavia is considering resuming relations with the Vietnamese Communist Party. According to reports from local newspapers today, the International Cooperation Committee of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia held a meeting yesterday to discuss the issue of resuming relations between the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and the Vietnamese Communist Party.

In 1978, Vietnam invaded and occupied Cambodia. The League of Communists of Yugoslavia took a principled stance, condemning Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia, and Vietnam unilaterally severed the party-to-party relations. The Vietnamese Communist Party has recently expressed interest in resuming cooperation with the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and indicated that this cooperation does not necessarily require high-level talks to begin. The Vietnamese side has already met with the Yugoslav ambassador to Vietnam and has authorized the Vietnamese ambassador to Yugoslavia to make contact with the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia.

　　南共盟考虑恢复与越共关系
    新华社贝尔格莱德2月7 日电　据此间报纸今天报道，南共联盟中央国际合作委员会昨天开会讨论了恢复南共盟与越共之间的关系问题。
    1978年，越南出兵侵占柬埔寨，南共联盟坚持原则立场，谴责越南入侵柬埔寨，越南单方面中断了两党关系。
    越南共产党最近表示对恢复同南共联盟的合作关系感兴趣，并表示这一合作不必通过双方高级会谈就可以开始。越方已接见了南驻越大使，并已授权越驻南大使同南共联盟中央进行接触。
