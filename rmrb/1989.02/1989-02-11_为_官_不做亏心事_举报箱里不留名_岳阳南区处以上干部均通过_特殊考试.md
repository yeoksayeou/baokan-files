Last October, the supervisory department of the southern district of Yueyang City, Hunan Province, made regulations regarding complaints about improper conduct involving district-level leaders. By the end of January this year, the names of all 28 district-level and above leaders in the district had not appeared in any complaint boxes, nor had any letters of complaint been forwarded by higher-level complaint centers.

The southern district is the central urban area of Yueyang City, with heavy responsibilities and a wide range of tasks. At the beginning of last year, the district, in response to the situation where a few people in society were engaging in improper conduct such as using power for personal gain, decided to further strengthen the constraint mechanism. It made specific regulations in 28 areas for clean governance, requiring all district-level and above leaders to lead by example in maintaining integrity. The district party committee and district government also took the lead in organizing regular talks and democratic appraisals, voluntarily accepting supervision from party and non-party cadres and the masses at the grassroots level. District Party Secretary Gao Beiyun went to the grassroots to do practical work, solving many real problems for district and street enterprises, but never took advantage of the enterprises. Gifts that could not be refused were handed over to the party committee of the organization, which recorded and handled them one by one. District Mayor Wei Jincun went to Beijing on a business trip. A fellow villager arranged for him a quota for 550,000 yuan worth of steel at the planned price. If he had resold it, he could have made a lot of money without anyone knowing, but Wei did not take a single cent, instead introducing the entire quota to a district enterprise in urgent need of steel.

　　为“官”不做亏心事　举报箱里不留名    
    岳阳南区处以上干部均通过“特殊考试”
    本报讯  去年１０月，湖南岳阳市南区监察部门就涉及区领导干部不正之风的举报问题，作出了有关规定。时至今年１月底，全区２８名副处级以上在职领导干部的名单没有一人进入举报箱，也没有一人由上级举报中心批转的信函指控。
    南区是岳阳市的中心城区，任务重，涉及面广。去年年初，这个区根据社会上少数人搞以权谋私等不正之风的现状，决定进一步强化约束机制，从２８个方面作出清廉从政的具体规定，要求全区副处级以上在职领导干部带头廉政。区委、区政府还牵头举办不定期的恳谈对话和民主评议活动，自觉接受党内外基层干部和群众的监督。区委书记高碧云下基层办实事，为区街企业解决了不少实际问题，但自己从不伸手沾企业的便宜。推不掉的礼品，他就交给机关党委，逐一登记处理。区长魏金存去北京出差，一位同乡给他联系了价值５５万元的平价钢材指标，如果从中倒卖，就会神不知、鬼不觉地赚笔大钱，老魏却分文不取，全都介绍给区内一家急需钢材的企业。
