According to a report on February 1 by the Economic Daily, the China Quality Management Association has announced that nationwide annual waste product losses account for 1.51% of the total industrial output value. Based on last year's national industrial output value of 1213.5 billion yuan, the annual waste product losses amounted to 18.32 billion yuan.

A survey conducted by relevant departments on 108 enterprises in the machinery, optical instruments, armaments, light industry, electronics, chemical, textile, metallurgy, and pharmaceutical sectors revealed that each enterprise on average incurs 680,000 yuan in waste product losses, accounting for 1.51% of the average industrial output value of the 108 enterprises. These statistical data are still incomplete, and the actual waste product losses are much higher than these figures.

Waste product losses include losses during production, transportation, "three guarantees" (repair, replacement, refund), downgrading and price reduction of substandard products, and other losses. Production process waste product losses and downgrading and price reduction losses account for 90.42% of the total waste product losses. Therefore, strengthening quality management during the production process remains an urgent task for Chinese enterprises and is an important way to improve economic efficiency.

How to solve the problem of high waste product rates? The experience of Tianjin City has attracted widespread attention. Last year, relevant departments in Tianjin conducted an analysis of tens of thousands of user letters to the Bicycle Factory No. 1 and No. 2, combined with product and process analysis, identified welding and electroplating as the two main issues, and finally calculated that the input-output qualification rate for bicycle frames was only 45%, and for bicycle rims, it was 56%. After taking measures, the frame return rate dropped by 60% within a week, and the input-output qualification rate for bicycle rims also improved to 93%.

　　我国去年废品造成的损失达１８３亿元
    据２月１日《经济日报》报道：中国质量管理协会公布全国每年废品损失占工业总产值的１．５１％，按去年全国工业总产值１２１３５亿元计算，全年废品损失达１８３．２亿元。
    有关部门对机械、光学仪器、兵器、轻工、电子、化工、纺织、冶金、医药系统的１０８家企业进行的调查表明，每个厂家平均废品损失为６８万元，占１０８家企业平均工业总产值的１．５１％。这些统计数据还只是不完全的统计，实际的废品损失远比这个数额大。
    废品损失包括生产过程损失、运输过程损失、“三包”损失、次品降级降价损失以及其他。生产过程废品损失和次品降级降价损失占废品总损失的９０．４２％。因此，加强生产过程的质量管理仍是我国企业的当务之急，也是提高经济效益的一个重要途径。
    解决废品率高的问题出路何在？天津市的经验引起了人们的普遍重视。去年该市有关部门到自行车一、二厂，对上万封用户来信进行分析，结合产品和工艺，找出了焊接、电镀两大主要问题，最后测算出车架的投入产出合格率仅为４５％，车圈为５６％，采取对策后，一周内车架返修率下降６０％，车圈的投入产出合格率也提高到９３％。
