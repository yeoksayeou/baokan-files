    Beijing has made significant strides in rectifying urban construction order through strict legal enforcement and public supervision. In 1988, the city saw a 35% reduction in illegal construction and a 12% decrease in illegal land occupation compared to the previous year. Specifically, the area affected by illegal construction and land occupation decreased by 38% and 66%, respectively.

    The crackdown on illegal construction is an annual effort, but what made 1988 different in Beijing? Firstly, the Municipal Planning Bureau collaborated with public security, judicial, urban management, housing, gardening, and industrial and commercial departments to focus on rectifying a batch of streets, alleys, roads, and residential communities. A total of 2,971 structures that impeded urban aesthetics and affected traffic were demolished, and 870 mu (approximately 58 hectares) of illegally occupied land were reclaimed. Secondly, 977 new cases of illegal land occupation were stopped and investigated. Thirdly, district and county leaders adhered to legal procedures and resolutely removed "nail households" (persistent violators).
