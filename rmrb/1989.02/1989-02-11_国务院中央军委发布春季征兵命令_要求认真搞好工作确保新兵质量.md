The State Council and the Central Military Commission recently issued the 1989 Spring Recruitment Order, requiring that recruitment work be carried out thoroughly to ensure the quality of new recruits.

The order specifies the objects and scope of this year's recruitment, age, conditions, methods, and time, and puts forward the following specific requirements:

	(1) Establish a post responsibility system and strictly examine and approve. All levels of people's governments and military regions are responsible for ensuring the quality of new recruits, especially county (city) level people's governments and military service agencies, which are directly responsible for the quality of new recruits. The responsibilities of relevant departments and recruitment personnel must be clearly defined, and each must perform their duties and be responsible for their own level. Each level must supervise the next level, and responsibility must be assigned to individuals. The political, physical, educational, and age conditions of young people who apply for recruitment must be strictly examined and approved according to the regulations. No concessions or falsehoods are allowed. For those who pass the political review and physical examination, a comprehensive evaluation must be made to select the best and ensure the quality of new recruits. Departments, units, and individuals who do not strictly perform their duties will be held accountable by their main leaders and the parties involved.

	(2) Maintain discipline and strictly prohibit improper practices. All levels of leaders and recruitment and reception personnel must strictly follow the recruitment order and relevant regulations. No backdoor deals are allowed. Regardless of whose child it is, if they do not meet the recruitment conditions, they must not be approved for enlistment, and the military will not accept them. Young people applying for recruitment must register in their place of household registration and are not allowed to enlist from other places. The number of new recruits must strictly follow the regulations. Military service agencies are not allowed to recruit more, and the military is not allowed to accept more. The list of young people approved for enlistment must be publicly posted to solicit public opinion. During non-recruitment periods, no unit or individual is allowed to approve or accept young people for enlistment. Those who violate regulations, engage in favoritism, falsify information, seek personal gain, or recruit and accept more during the recruitment process will be seriously dealt with.

	(3) Recruitment departments and receiving units must support and cooperate with each other. Each unit must select cadres with good political and organizational skills to be in charge of recruitment work. Recruitment personnel must follow the law and actively assist local authorities in carrying out recruitment work. Local governments and recruitment departments must make full use of the role of recruitment personnel, listen to their opinions, and promptly handle the handover of new recruits. After new recruits arrive at their units, a thorough quarantine and re-examination must be conducted. Those who are found to be unqualified must be firmly returned. The provincial military region system must ensure implementation. County (city) people's governments and military service agencies must not refuse to accept unqualified new recruits returned by the military according to regulations; the military must not handle new recruits who should not be returned as returned soldiers. In case of disputes, the provincial military region (garrison command, defense command) will make the final decision.

	(4) Strengthen leadership and tighten organization. This recruitment period coincides with the spring farming season in most regions. All levels of people's governments must take effective measures, coordinate arrangements, and reasonably deploy to ensure that recruitment work and agricultural production do not interfere with each other. Military regions must take recruitment work as an important task and handle it seriously. Commanders and political commissars of provincial military regions and military sub-regions must focus on recruitment work. All relevant departments must work together, perform their duties, and jointly complete the recruitment task. Local authorities must take various forms to strengthen national defense education and education on serving in the military according to law, and do a good job of ideological work for young people and their parents, so that the majority of young people of military age can consciously fulfill their military service obligations and defend the motherland. For a few young people who refuse or evade recruitment and do not change after education, they must be dealt with according to the relevant provisions of the Military Service Law. In conjunction with recruitment, a thorough inspection of preferential treatment work must be carried out. Problems found must be promptly resolved. Public security and health departments must strictly follow the regulations to conduct political reviews and physical examinations of young people applying for recruitment. Railway and transportation departments must organize the transportation of new recruits in an orderly manner, provide food and prevent diseases during transportation, and ensure the safe arrival of new recruits at their units.

    新华社北京２月１０日电  国务院、中央军委最近发布１９８９年春季征兵命令，要求认真搞好征兵工作，确保新兵质量。
    命令规定了今年征集对象和范围、征集年龄、条件、办法和时间，并提出了下列具体要求：
    （一）建立岗位责任制，严格审查把关。各级人民政府、各级军区对保证新兵质量要负起全部责任，特别是县（市）一级人民政府和兵役机关，对新兵质量要负直接责任。要明确各有关部门和征兵工作人员的职责，必须做到各司其职，各负其责，一级抓一级，责任到人。要切实按照规定的条件，对报名应征青年的政治、身体、文化和年龄进行严格的检查和审查，不得降低条件迁就照顾，不得弄虚作假。对政审、体检合格的青年，要全面衡量，择优审批，确保新兵质量。对不严格履行职责的部门、单位和个人，要追究主要领导和当事人的责任。
    （二）严肃纪律，严禁搞不正之风。各级领导和征兵、接兵人员，要严格按照征兵命令和有关规定办事，不准开后门，走后门，不管是谁的子女，凡不符合征集条件的，一律不得批准入伍，部队也不得接收。应征青年必须在户口所在地报名，不准从异地入伍。要严格按照规定的征兵名额征补新兵，兵役机关不准多征，部队不准多接。对拟定批准入伍的青年，要张榜公布，听取群众意见。在非征兵期间，任何单位和个人都不得批准和接收青年入伍。对在征兵工作中违反规定，徇私舞弊、弄虚作假、以权谋私，多征多接的，要严肃处理。
    （三）征兵部门和接兵部队要互相支持，密切配合。各部队要选派思想作风好、政策观念强、有组织能力的干部负责接兵工作。接兵人员到地方后要遵纪守法、积极协助地方搞好征兵工作。地方政府和征兵部门要注意发挥接兵人员的作用，认真听取他们的意见，及时办理好新兵交接。新兵到达部队后，要认真搞好检疫复查，发现不合格的，要坚决退回，省军区系统必须保证落实。县（市）人民政府和兵役机关对部队按规定退回的不合格新兵不得拒绝接收；部队不得把不该退的新兵作退兵处理，遇有争议时，由省军区（卫戍区、警备区）裁定。
    （四）加强领导，严密组织。这次征兵，多数地区正值春耕农忙季节。各级人民政府要采取有效措施，统筹安排，合理部署，确保征兵工作和农业生产两不误。各军区要把征兵工作作为一项重要任务认真抓好。省军区、军分区司令员、政治委员要集中精力抓好征兵工作。各有关部门要通力协作，尽职尽责，共同完成好征兵任务。各地要采取多种形式抓好国防教育和依法服兵役的教育，做好青年及其家长的思想工作，使广大适龄青年自觉履行兵役义务，保卫祖国。对少数拒绝、逃避征集，经教育不改的应征青年，要按照兵役法的有关规定处理。要结合征兵，对优抚工作认真进行一次检查，发现问题，要及时予以解决。公安、卫生部门要按照规定的条件，切实搞好应征青年的政治审查和体格检查工作。铁道、交通部门要严密组织新兵运输，搞好运输途中的饮食供应和卫生防病工作，确保新兵安全到达部队。
