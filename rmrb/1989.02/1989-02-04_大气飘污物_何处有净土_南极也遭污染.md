For a long time, the South Pole has been regarded as a pollution-free place, but this is not actually the case. Chinese researchers have found through the analysis of marine biological samples from the Antarctic Peninsula and Davis Station that there are traces of "DDT" and "BHC" (Benzene Hexachloride).

These biological samples include lichens, seaweed, sea urchins, and clams, which were collected by Guo Kun and Lü Peiding during their Antarctic expeditions. Researchers from the First Institute of Oceanography under the State Oceanic Administration, including Mao Xinghua and Zhang Xinsheng, have determined that although the concentrations of "DDT" and "BHC" in these samples are very low, they do exist. They also discovered that the closer the South Pole is to areas of human activity, the more severe the pollution.

Researchers also compared samples from the South Pole with those collected from Qingdao, proving that the pollution of "DDT" and "BHC" in the South Pole is relatively mild. For example, the concentrations of "DDT" and "BHC" in seaweed from the Antarctic Peninsula are one order of magnitude lower than those in seaweed from Taipingjiao in Qingdao.

### 大气飘污物　何处有净土  南极也遭污染

　　大气飘污物　何处有净土
　  南极也遭污染
    新华社拉斯曼丘陵２月３日电  （记者张继民）长期以来，南极被称为无污染的地方，实际并非如此。我国有关科研人员近年来通过对南极半岛和戴维斯站海洋生物样品的化验，均发现有“六六六”、滴滴涕的存在。
    这些生物样品有地衣、海藻、海胆、蛤等，它们分别是由郭琨、吕培顶等在南极考察时采集的。国家海洋局第一研究所的研究人员毛兴华、张新胜等通过测定表明，尽管这些样品中“六六六”、滴滴涕的含量很低，但都有所存在。他们还发现，南极越是接近人类长期生产和生活的地方，污染就相对重些。
    研究人员还将南极的样品和采自青岛的样品做了对比，证明南极被“六六六”、滴滴涕的污染是轻微的。如南极半岛海藻内“六六六”、滴滴涕的含量均要比青岛太平角的海藻低一个数量级。
