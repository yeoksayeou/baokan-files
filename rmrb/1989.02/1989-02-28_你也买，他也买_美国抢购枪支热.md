Since early February, in the United States, especially in California, gun stores have been crowded with customers every day. The counters are filled with people in layers, all eager to purchase highly automated and mechanically reliable firearms. Some customers are so anxious that they can't even wait a day, fearing that they might not get the guns and their lives will be in danger.

According to reports in American newspapers, the direct cause of this gun-buying frenzy is the tragic incident that occurred on January 17 at an elementary school in Stockton, California. A man named Patrick Purdy stormed into the school grounds, firing over 100 rounds from an automatic rifle, killing 5 students on the spot and injuring 29 students and a teacher. He then ended his own life with a handgun. This mad act of violence has cast a shadow of terror over the entire United States.

Some people ask, if even elementary schools are not safe, where can one find security? Many Americans have therefore concluded that to survive, one must arm oneself, and the better the weapon, the better. Thus, the domestic gun market in the United States is booming.

In this situation, calls for strict control over gun ownership within society are growing louder in Congress and outside. People hope that the government will take effective measures. However, many Americans do not agree, believing that the right to own guns is a constitutional right that cannot be taken away from American citizens. The National Rifle Association, with 3 million members, is a strong advocate of this viewpoint. Its members are writing to congressmen to exert pressure, opposing strict controls on gun sales.

In recent years, some American cities have become battlegrounds where police, criminals, and frightened citizens fire their guns indiscriminately. A civilian "arms race" has been sparked in the United States. Many drug dealers have legally acquired various firearms to protect their illegal interests and to resist anti-drug police. Among thieves, the number of those who own guns is increasing, and armed robberies are on the rise. Many American citizens have lost confidence in the police's ability to maintain public order, believing that "personal safety must be defended by oneself." In the past, most gun owners used their guns for hunting or sports (shooting), but now more than half use them for self-defense. Guns have always been considered a symbol of a man's strength and dignity, and women have little interest in them. Today, however, the number of women owning guns is increasing. Statistics show that from 1983 to 1986, the number of women owning guns increased by 53%. Currently, there are 2 million women planning to buy guns. Reports indicate that women are doing this out of necessity.

Does owning a gun really ensure safety? Experts say no. They believe that the more gun owners there are, the less secure society becomes. The recent increase in suicides in the United States is closely related to gun ownership. Statistics show that in 1986, 18,153 people committed suicide in the United States, most of them using guns. Without a gun, suicide is not so convenient; but with a gun in hand, it is easy to carry out the act. Guns, if not properly stored at home, can easily cause accidents. Children playing with guns and accidentally firing them is a common occurrence. Additionally, disputes between neighbors, fathers and sons, or friends often lead to the use of guns. Therefore, many people advocate that the government should strictly control gun sales and registration. Of course, this work must be closely coordinated with anti-drug efforts and strengthening public security.

### 你也买，他也买  美国抢购枪支热

　　你也买，他也买  美国抢购枪支热
    肖嵘
    ２月初以来，在美国特别是在加利福尼亚州，销售枪支的商店天天人挤得满满的，柜台前顾客有三四层，都争着要购买自动化程度高、机械性能好的枪支。有的顾客心情焦急得连一天也等不下去了，深怕得不到这类枪支自身的性命朝不保夕了。
    据美国报刊报道，出现这一枪支抢购风的直接原因是１月１７日发生在加州斯托克顿小学的一起惨案。一个名叫帕屈利克·普尔德的凶手闯进该小学校园，端起一支自动步枪，一连射出１００多发子弹，５名学生当场饮弹毙命，２９名学生和一位老师负伤。接着，他用手枪结束了自己的生命。这一疯狂行动产生的恐怖气氛笼罩着全美国。
    有人问，假如连小学校园里都不安宁，那何处才安全呢？不少美国人因而得出结论：要生存下去，就得把自己武装起来，而且武器越精越好。于是，美国枪支内销生意看好。
    在这种形势下，议会内外要求严格控制社会上枪支的呼声日益高涨起来，希望政府采取有力措施。然而，有不少美国人却不以为然，认为拥有枪支是宪法上明文规定的、美国公民不可被剥夺的权利。有３００万会员的全美步枪协会就是这一观点的有力维护者。它的成员纷纷向议员们写信施加压力，反对对枪支销售的严格控制。
    近年来，美国一些城市街道成了警察、罪犯、受惊公民挥动枪支随便开火的场所。一场平民“军备竞赛”在美国国内掀起。不少贩毒分子通过合法的手段拥有各种枪支，来保护他们的非法利益，并与肃毒警察武装对抗。在盗窃分子中，拥有枪支的也在不断增加，武装抢劫事件有增无减。不少美国公民因而对警察维护治安的能力丧失了信心，认为“人身安全只有靠自己动手来保卫”。过去，多数枪支拥有者把枪用来狩猎或运动（射击），而今有半数以上用来自卫。枪支一向被认为是男士的力量和威严的象征，妇女很少有兴趣。今天，拥有枪支的女性在不断增加，据统计，１９８６年与１９８３年相比，增加了５３％。目前，尚有２００万妇女打算买枪支。据报道，妇女这样干也是环境所逼。
    有了枪支，安全真的有保障吗？专家们的回答是否定的。他们认为，枪支拥有者的人数越多，社会安全越没有保障。美国近年来自杀人数的剧增与拥有枪支有着密切关系。据统计，１９８６年美国有１８１５３人自杀，多数是用枪支丧命的。没有枪支，自杀不那么方便；而一枪在手，就不同了，一动自杀念头，就可轻而易举地如愿以偿。枪支在家庭里保管不当也容易导致走火。小孩玩枪支走火的事常有发生。此外，邻居、父子或朋友之间发生争吵而动用枪支的也屡见不鲜。为此，一般人主张政府应从枪支销售、登记管理等方面严加控制。当然，这项工作必须与禁毒、加强社会治安等方面紧密配合起来。
