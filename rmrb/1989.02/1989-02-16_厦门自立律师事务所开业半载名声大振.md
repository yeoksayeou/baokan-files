The cooperative Xiamen Self-Reliant Law Firm, established just half a year ago, has already handled over 40,000 cases of various types; provided legal consultations to 2,700 individuals from within and outside the country; and has 40-plus enterprises and units hiring its lawyers as legal advisors.

This law firm has gained the trust of people both domestically and internationally due to its fairness, integrity, and efficiency.

Last June, the deputy director of the Xiamen Municipal Legal Affairs Bureau, Hóng Qiūshēng, along with bureau staff members Xǔ Qiónglín and Lài Lúnlián, gave up their "iron rice bowls" and, together with retired cadre Lǐ Rúsuí, who has a lawyer's qualification, pooled resources to establish the Self-Reliant Law Firm.

Since last year, the number of Taiwanese investors going to Xiamen has surged. Considering that Taiwanese investors are not familiar with mainland procedures, the Self-Reliant Law Firm, in addition to representing them in lawsuits, pursuing debts, and conducting commercial credit investigations, has also launched a "one-stop service" for investments.

So far, they have provided one-stop services to nine Taiwanese and foreign investors, four of whom have already started their businesses.

　　厦门自立律师事务所开业半载名声大振
    据新华社厦门电  （记者王炜中）合作制的厦门自立律师事务所成立不过半年，已受理各类案件４万多件；向海内外当事人提供法律咨询２７００多人次，有４０多家企业、单位聘请所内律师担任法律顾问。
    这家律师事务所由于公正、廉洁、高效，已日益获得国内外人士的信赖。
    去年６月，厦门市法制局副局长洪秋生、局里干部许琼琳、赖伦廉这几名兼职律师放弃“铁饭碗”，与具有律师资格的离休干部李如绥一起，自筹资金开办了自立律师事务所。
    去年以来，台商前往厦门投资的人数激增，自立律师事务所考虑台商不熟悉大陆办事程序的实际情况，除了为他们代理诉讼，追讨债务和进行商业信用调查外，还开展“投资一揽子代理”业务。
    到目前为止，他们已为九家台商和外商提供了一揽子服务，其中有四家企业已经开业。
