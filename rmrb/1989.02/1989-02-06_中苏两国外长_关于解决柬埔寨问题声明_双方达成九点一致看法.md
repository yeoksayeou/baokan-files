The full text of the statement by the foreign ministers of China and the Soviet Union on the resolution of the Cambodian issue is as follows:

The foreign ministers of China, Qian Qichen, and the Soviet Union, Eduard Shevardnadze, held discussions in Beijing on the resolution of the Cambodian issue. They exchanged views frankly and reached a consensus on the following points:

1. Both sides advocate for an early, fair, and reasonable political resolution to the Cambodian issue and are willing to make efforts to achieve this goal.

2. Both sides believe that the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Cambodia is an important component of a political resolution to the Cambodian issue. Both sides have noted Vietnam's decision to withdraw all its troops from Cambodia by no later than the end of September 1989 and hope that this decision will be implemented, thereby promoting the progress of negotiations on other aspects of the Cambodian issue.

After the complete withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Cambodia, there should be no presence of foreign military forces or bases on Cambodian territory.

3. Both sides believe that as Vietnamese troops withdraw from Cambodia, military aid from relevant countries to any party in Cambodia should gradually decrease and ultimately cease.

4. China and the Soviet Union believe that internal issues in Cambodia should be resolved through negotiations among Cambodian parties on the basis of national reconciliation, without any external interference. Both sides welcome the four-party dialogue in Cambodia and hope that this dialogue will develop effectively.

The Chinese side advocates for the establishment of a provisional united government of Cambodia led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk and consisting of representatives from the four parties.

The Soviet side will support the Cambodian four parties in reaching an agreement on the establishment of a provisional body chaired by Sihanouk, which will not be subordinate to any party in Cambodia and will be tasked with implementing agreements reached by the Cambodian parties and holding free elections.

China and the Soviet Union will respect the results of future free elections in Cambodia.

5. Both sides are concerned about and believe it is necessary to prevent dangerous situations and internal conflicts in Cambodia after the withdrawal of foreign troops. Both sides welcome the agreement reached by the Cambodian four parties on effective measures to prevent such developments, including the cessation of all hostile military actions and the freezing and possible reduction of armed forces.

Both sides advocate that Cambodia should not return to its recent policies and practices.

China and the Soviet Union believe that the establishment of an effective international monitoring mechanism is necessary and important for the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops, the cessation of foreign military aid, the maintenance of peace in Cambodia, and the conduct of free elections under strict international supervision.

6. Both sides believe that, as conditions gradually form, the United Nations mechanism can play its due role in the process of politically resolving the Cambodian issue. Both sides agree to convene an international conference on the Cambodian issue when conditions are ripe.

7. Both sides advocate for international guarantees of Cambodia's status as an independent, peaceful, neutral, and non-aligned country after the withdrawal of foreign troops. China and the Soviet Union express their willingness to participate in this international guarantee.

8. Both sides agree to continue discussions on the remaining differences regarding certain aspects of the resolution of the Cambodian issue.

9. Both sides believe that the resolution of the Cambodian issue will help eliminate the roots of tension in Southeast Asia and promote the normalization of the political situation, as well as contribute to peace and stability in the region.

　　中苏两国外长
　  关于解决柬埔寨问题声明
　　双方达成九点一致看法
    新华社北京二月五日电  中国和苏联两国外交部长关于解决柬埔寨问题的声明，全文如下：
    中国外交部长钱其琛与苏联外交部长谢瓦尔德纳泽在北京会晤期间就解决柬埔寨问题进行了认真、坦率的讨论，各自阐述了自己的立场，就以下各点达成了一致：
    一、双方主张尽早公正合理地政治解决柬埔寨问题，并表示愿意作出努力，以促进这一目标的实现。
    二、双方认为，越南从柬埔寨撤军是政治解决柬埔寨问题的重要组成部分。双方注意到越南宣布的至迟于一九八九年九月底之前从柬埔寨全部撤军的决定，并希望这一决定付诸实施将促进解决柬埔寨问题其它方面的谈判进程。
    越南全部从柬埔寨撤军后，在柬埔寨领土上不能有外国军队和军事基地的存在。
    三、双方认为，随着越南军队从柬埔寨撤出，有关各国对柬埔寨任何一方的军事援助都应当逐步减少，直至完全停止。
    四、中苏两国认为，柬埔寨的内部问题应由柬埔寨各方在民族和解的基础上，在没有任何外来干涉的情况下通过谈判解决。双方欢迎柬埔寨四方对话，并希望这种对话能卓有成效地发展。
    中国方面主张建立以西哈努克亲王为首的有四方代表参加的柬埔寨临时联合政府。
    苏联方面将支持柬埔寨四方就建立西哈努克主持下的有四方代表参加的临时机构达成一致，该机构不从属于柬埔寨任何一方，其任务是实施柬埔寨各方达成的各项协议和举行自由选举。
    中苏两国将尊重柬埔寨未来自由选举的结果。
    五、双方关心并认为必要的是，在外国军队从柬埔寨撤出后，在这个国家不出现危险局势和发生内战。双方欢迎柬埔寨四方就防止这种事态发展采取有效措施达成协议，这些措施包括停止一切敌对军事行动、冻结和随之可能削减武装力量。
    双方主张柬埔寨不回到不久前的政策和实践。
    中苏双方认为，建立有效的国际监督机制，对越南撤军、外国停止军事援助、维持柬埔寨和平以及进行自由选举实行严格的国际监督是必要的和重要的。
    六、双方认为，在政治解决柬埔寨问题的进程中，随着条件的逐步形成，联合国机制可以发挥应有的作用。双方赞成在条件成熟时召开柬埔寨问题的国际会议。
    七、双方主张，在外国军队撤出后，应对柬埔寨作为独立、和平、中立、不结盟国家的地位进行国际保证。中苏两国表示两国将愿意参加此项国际保证。
    八、双方同意就解决柬埔寨问题的某些方面尚存的分歧继续进行讨论。
    九、中苏双方认为，柬埔寨问题的解决将有助于消除东南亚紧张局势的根源和政治局势的健康化，也将促进该地区的和平与稳定。
