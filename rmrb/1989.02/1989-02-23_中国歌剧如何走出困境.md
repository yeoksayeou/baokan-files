Opera, along with symphonic music and ballet, is one of the three major musical genres that represent a nation's and a country's musical and cultural level.

Opera is a comprehensive art form that combines music, literature, drama (and even dance), and integrates visual and auditory elements. It has a large stage and spatial capacity, diverse expression methods, and a wide range of emotional expression, making it grand and magnificent, with both sound and emotion. It can be called the king of the musical art kingdom!

Generally speaking, opera, like symphonic music and ballet, is an imported art form. However, since opera is always produced in conjunction with a particular nation's language, it faces more complex issues and more problems to solve compared to symphonic music and ballet.

In the past decade of the new era, due to the social conditions of reform and opening up, a large number of classic foreign operas have been introduced to our country; composers and librettists have greatly expanded their horizons, and their writing enthusiasm has reached an unprecedented level; various types of operas have emerged one after another, and the opera industry has shown initial signs of prosperity, as represented by the three major operas that emerged in a certain period: "The Wild Field," "Desire in the Imperial Palace," and "Skyward Roar." At least, amidst the sighs of "the opera industry is not flourishing" and "the opera industry is struggling," they still showed the vitality of Chinese opera.

However, the journey of ten years is just a beginning. Facing the changing Chinese society with reform and opening up and the development of a commodity economy, and facing the rapidly changing information exchange and the multi-faceted development of compositional techniques in the contemporary world, Chinese opera still faces many difficulties. Summarized, there are two main contradictions. The first is the sharp contradiction between the audience's rapidly increasing and diverse aesthetic needs and the current level of opera creation and performance. The second is the sharp contradiction between the enthusiasm of composers, librettists, directors, performers, and all opera industry professionals in opera production and the current opera production management system. The term "sharp" refers to the fact that it has reached a critical point where it must be resolved immediately.

First, we must recognize the characteristics of opera art itself. Although the production method of an opera can be chosen according to individual preferences, in the current situation in China, at the beginning of creation, it is best for the composer, librettist, and director to work together as a unit. This can integrate the three different types of imagery thinking—music, drama, and literature—into the embryo, enriching and supplementing each other. It can also make the first creation (desk work) and the second creation (stage work) penetrate and influence each other. The consistency of this thinking and the continuity of creation can ensure a higher success rate for this highly integrated art form. The composer (the key person determining the success or failure of an opera) when writing an opera, must handle three relationships well: first, the relationship between music and drama. In an opera, music should be the music of drama, and drama should be the drama of music. Drama is the foundation, and music is the guiding force. Grasping this point can lay the foundation for a true opera in terms of structure and rhythm (here referring to the dramatic rhythm of the entire play). Second, the relationship between vocal music and instrumental music. These are the two major means of opera art in music, and they cannot be biased in use. The common phenomenon of vocal music being the main focus and instrumental music being the accompaniment will inevitably lead to flat and monotonous music. Of course, vocal music should not be underestimated. The ideal should be vocal music as the guiding force, instrumental music as the foundation, and the unity of symphonic, substantive, and overall characteristics. Third, the relationship between arias, recitatives, chants, rhymed dialogue, and even spoken dialogue. Generally speaking, arias form the large framework of music, which is suitable for the sublimation of emotions, while recitatives and others are the links between the various frameworks, suitable for explaining the plot and developing conflicts. Of course, these two are also constrained by the overall musical situation. In addition, while insisting on the coexistence of multiple types of operas, from grand opera (or called serious opera), comic opera (or called light opera), ballad opera, musical drama (or called sung drama), to contemporary musicals, etc., all can coexist. The diversity of types not only meets the people's multi-level appreciation needs but also can fully exploit the creativity of composers with different personalities and talents, thus forming a colorful opera whole.

Next, we must continuously update the concept of opera creation.

Chinese opera has two traditions: one is as part of China's long-standing cultural heritage—drama, and the modern new opera tradition; the other is the Western opera tradition with several hundred years of professional creation experience, which has accumulated a large number of excellent works. However, we must closely combine the inheritance of tradition with contemporary aesthetic consciousness. In the vast tradition and contemporary multi-faceted compositional techniques, composers should be aware of their pursuit of innovation. In an opera, whether it is the use of techniques, the grasp of style, or the insistence on individuality, it should be unified under one premise, that is, what coordinates the composer chooses! We should set the coordinates at the level of "making contemporary audiences jump to pick this peach." Only emphasizing the passive adaptation of "reception aesthetics" and not actively improving the aesthetic level of the receiver will inevitably lead to the loss of innovative spirit and the emergence of a large number of mediocre works.

It is quite normal for composers to be enthusiastic about the pursuit of formal beauty. Mastering Western modern techniques can greatly enrich one's expressive methods, but if one only pays attention to the use of techniques and ignores the purpose of using them, only pays attention to the techniques themselves and ignores the social background that produced these techniques, resulting in either mechanical imitation or deliberate show-off in the work, and developing the pursuit of formal beauty to the point of ignoring the expression of human emotions, then it is undoubtedly equivalent to fundamentally negating the form itself.

Currently, the management system of opera production in our country still follows the model of the 1950s. A literary script is sent for review layer by layer; after rehearsals, there are endless revisions; when it comes to performance, it is like Jiang Taigong fishing—waiting for volunteers, waiting for the audience. Therefore, a play often takes a long time, consumes a lot of resources, and involves many people from creation to performance, and after the performance, it is often due to "the more performances, the more losses; the fewer performances, the fewer losses; no performances, no losses" that it ends up being hastily concluded. Such a cycle, without limit, who would still be willing to engage in opera? It can be said that the reform of the artistic management system is also a key issue related to whether the opera industry can survive and develop.

　　中国歌剧如何走出困境
    金湘
    歌剧和交响乐、芭蕾舞一样，是代表一个民族、一个国家音乐文化水平的三大音乐体裁之一。
    歌剧又是音乐、文学、戏剧（甚至于舞蹈）三者综合，以及视听结合的艺术。它舞台时空容量大，综合表现手段多，表达情感幅度广，因而壮观瑰丽，声情并茂，可谓音乐艺术王国之王！
    一般地讲，歌剧和交响乐、芭蕾舞一样是外来的艺术形式。但由于歌剧总是与某个民族的语言结合后才产生的，因此，比之交响乐、芭蕾舞，它遇到的问题更为复杂，要解决的课题也更多。
    新时期十年来，由于改革开放的社会条件，大量外国经典歌剧被介绍到我国；作曲家、编剧家视野大大开阔，写作积极性空前高涨；大批各种类型的歌剧纷纷问世，歌剧事业出现了初步的繁荣局面，犹以前一段时期先后出现的《原野》、《深宫欲海》、《仰天长啸》三部大歌剧为代表。至少是在一片“歌剧事业不景气”、“歌剧步履艰难”……的感叹声中，它们依然显示了中国歌剧的生命力。
    但，十年的道路仅是一个开端。面对着改革开放、商品经济日益发展的中国社会，面对信息交流日新月异、作曲技法多元发展的当今世界，我国歌剧当前仍面临着重重困难。归纳起来主要有两个矛盾。其一，听众迅速提高的、多元的审美需求与当前歌剧创作、表演水平的尖锐矛盾；其二，作曲家、编剧家、导演、演员以及一切歌剧界同行们在歌剧生产上的积极性与当前歌剧生产管理体制的尖锐矛盾。所谓“尖锐”，是指已到了刻不容缓、必须解决的地步。
    首先，要认识歌剧艺术自身的特点。一部歌剧的生产方式虽可因人而宜地抉择，但就目前中国的情况而言，在创作之始，作曲家、编剧家、导演最好能三位一体，共同构想。这既能使音乐、戏剧、文学三种不同类型的形象思维融合于胚胎之中，互相丰富，互为补充；又能使一度创作（案头的）与二度创作（舞台的）互相渗透，互为因果。这种思维的一致性、创作的连贯性，能保证歌剧这种综合性极强的艺术作品较高的成功率。作曲家（决定一部歌剧成败的关键人物）在写一部歌剧时，要处理好三对关系：一是音乐与戏剧的关系。在一部歌剧中，音乐应是戏剧的音乐，戏剧应是音乐的戏剧。戏剧为基础，音乐是主导。把握住这点，方能从结构上、节奏上（这里指的是全剧的戏剧节奏）奠定一部真正的歌剧。二是声乐与器乐的关系。这是歌剧艺术形式在音乐上的两大手段，运用起来偏一不可。那种常见的声乐为主、器乐伴奏的现象势必导致音乐的平面、单调。当然，也不能轻视声乐。理想的应是声乐为主导，器乐为基础，交响性、主体性、整体性的统一。三是咏叹调与宣叙调、吟诵、韵白以至说白的关系。一般地讲，咏叹调构成音乐的大框架，宜于情感的升华，宣叙调及其它则是各个框架之间的链环，宜于交待情节，展开矛盾。当然，这两者又都是制约于总的音乐态势发展之中。此外，要坚持歌剧多品种的同时并存。从大歌剧（或称正歌剧）、喜歌剧（或称轻歌剧）、歌谣体歌剧、音乐话剧（或称话剧加唱）、歌舞剧，直至当代的音乐剧等等均可并存。品种的多元化既符合人民多层次的欣赏需求，又可以充分发挥个性、才华各不相同的各类作曲家的创造力，从而组成一个绚丽多彩的歌剧的整体。
    再就是要不断地更新歌剧创作观念。
    中国的歌剧有两方面的传统，一是作为我国民族悠久文化的组成部分之一——戏剧，以及现代的新歌剧传统；一是有几百年专业创作经验，积累了一大批优秀剧目的西洋歌剧传统。但是，必须把传统的继承与当代的审美意识紧密结合起来。在浩瀚的传统与当代多元作曲技法面前，作曲家在不断追求创新时，应该心中有数。在一部歌剧里，运用技法也好，把握风格也好，坚持个性也好，都要统一在一个前提下，即作曲家选择什么样的座标！我们应把座标定在“让当代观众跳一下才能摘到这个桃子”的水准上。只强调“接受美学”的被动适应，而不去主观能动地提高接受者的美学水平，必然导致创新精神之失落与平庸之作大量涌现。
    作曲家热衷于对形式美的追求是十分正常的。掌握西方现代技法，可以大大丰富自己的表现手法，但如果只注意技法的运用，而忽视运用它的目的，只注意技法本身而忽视产生这些技法的社会背景，以致在作品中或是生搬硬套，或是有意炫耀，把对形式美的追求发展到了无视表达人的情感的地步，那无疑也等于从根本上否定了形式本身。
    目前我国歌剧生产的管理体制，仍是沿用五十年代的模式，一个文学台本出来，层层送阅、审查；开排之后，又是无穷的修改；待到上演时，又总是姜太公钓鱼——愿者上钩，坐等观众。因此，一个戏往往从创作到上演耗时长、耗资大、耗人多，而上演后又总是由于“多演多赔、少演少赔、不演不赔”而草草收场。如此周而复返，无限循环，谁还有心思去从事歌剧？可以说，艺术管理体制的变革也是一个关系歌剧事业能否生存、发展的关键性问题。
