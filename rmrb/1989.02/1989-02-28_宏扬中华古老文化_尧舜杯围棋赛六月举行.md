Go is a precious gem of our Chinese nation's ancient culture. It is said to have been invented during the time of Yao and Shun, and has a history of over three thousand years. In recent years, it has been widely loved by people from all walks of life both at home and abroad.

Initiated by Professor He Xiangtao of Chinese astronomy and Go master Nie Weiping, and co-sponsored by 15 renowned figures in the Go world, including Wu Qingyuan, Jin Yong, Ying Changqi, and Qian Weichang, the first "Yao-Shun Cup" World Go Friendship Tournament is scheduled to be held in late June in Beijing.

The "Yao-Shun Cup" tournament is a folk Go exchange activity. Participants will compete under their individual names, aiming to improve their skills, promote the popularization and development of Go, and advance Go to the world stage. The organizing committee of the Go Friendship Tournament warmly welcomes compatriots from Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macao, overseas Chinese, and Go enthusiasts from around the world to sign up and participate enthusiastically.
