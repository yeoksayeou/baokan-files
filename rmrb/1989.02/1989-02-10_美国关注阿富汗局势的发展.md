The United States has no doubts about the Soviet Union's planned withdrawal from Afghanistan; what people are now discussing and speculating about is whether the Najibullah regime in Kabul, supported by the Soviet Union, can maintain its power after the Soviet troops withdraw, and how the political situation in Afghanistan will develop in the future.

Nine years ago, the Soviet Union's large-scale invasion of Afghanistan brought a huge national disaster to Afghanistan; the Soviet Union itself not only suffered heavy losses but also paid a high political and moral price.

The Soviet leadership at that time decided to send troops to Afghanistan with the strategic intention of moving south to the Persian Gulf, waiting for an opportunity to control the entire Middle East region and threaten the "soft underbelly" of the southern flank of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. This "southern strategy" immediately provoked countermeasures from the United States and its allies, one of which was the United States' continuous supply of weapons to the Afghan resistance forces, estimated to be worth about $2 billion. In this way, Afghanistan became one of the "hotspots" in the Soviet-American struggle.

The new Soviet leadership has made a sober assessment of the domestic and international situation and has adjusted its diplomatic and military strategies accordingly. The Soviet Union decided last year to withdraw troops from Afghanistan. International opinion believes that this is a wise move and has given it due recognition.

However, the withdrawal of Soviet troops will not immediately end the tragedy in Afghanistan.

Last year, during the Geneva talks, the U.S. side demanded that after the Soviet withdrawal, both the Soviet Union and the United States should stop providing military aid to their respective supported sides. However, the Soviet Union has consistently refused on the grounds that it has obligations to the Kabul government. Analysts in Washington speculate that after the Soviet troops withdraw, the Kabul government may be overthrown by force within a few weeks or months, or it may collapse from within. After being driven out of Kabul, they may retreat to the northern border regions of Afghanistan near the Soviet Union, relying on Soviet logistics and air support from Soviet forces within the Soviet Union to continue their stubborn resistance. In this situation, the United States will inevitably continue to provide military aid to the resistance forces. Thus, the conflict between the forces of the Soviet Union and its protégé Najibullah on one side, and the resistance forces and their American supporters on the other, will continue. The struggle between the Soviet Union and the United States will not yet be over.

Analysts in Washington also believe that for the United States, another real danger is that in the absence of external threats, the various factions of the Afghan resistance forces, due to differences in political views, sectarian conflicts, and certain external influences, will not be able to quickly form a broad-based and stable interim coalition government. This will result in a period of political chaos, and even a civil war. This will not only prevent hundreds of thousands of refugees from returning home and rebuilding the economy, but will also give pro-Soviet forces an opportunity to take advantage of the situation.

The United States is currently closely monitoring the developments in Afghanistan. However, various indications suggest that Washington feels it is powerless to influence the situation. Although President Bush said soon after taking office that the United States would play a "catalytic" role in Afghanistan's peace and stability after the Soviet withdrawal, officials in the State Department cannot specify how this role will be played. The U.S. government has repeatedly stated that the United States does not intend to interfere in Afghanistan's internal affairs, and the choice of government should be decided by the Afghan people themselves. An article in the February 5 issue of The New York Times wrote on this topic: "Even if the United States tries to influence the situation there, its huge investment in the resistance forces does not necessarily guarantee loyalty, or obtain such a promise: no matter what kind of government ultimately controls the situation, it (to the United States) will be friendly."

　　美国关注阿富汗局势的发展
    新华社记者　吴晋　马世骏
    对于苏联将如期从阿富汗撤军一事，美国方面已不存疑问；人们现在议论、猜测较多的是，在苏军撤退后，苏联支持的喀布尔纳吉布拉政权能否维持，以及阿富汗的政局今后将如何发展。
    ９年多前，苏军大举入侵阿富汗使阿富汗蒙受了一场巨大的民族灾难；苏联自己也不仅损兵折将，而且因此在政治上、道义上付出了高昂的代价。
    苏联当时的领导集团之所以决定出兵阿富汗，其战略意图在于南下波斯湾，伺机进而控制整个中东地区，威胁北大西洋公约组织南翼“柔软的下腹部”。它的这一“南下战略”意图立即招致了美国及其盟国的对抗措施，其中之一就是美国源源不断地向阿富汗抵抗力量提供军火武器，其总额估计约有２０亿美元之多。这样，阿富汗就成了苏美争夺的“热点”之一。
    苏联新领导清醒地估计了国内外形势，相应调整了外交、军事战略。苏联于去年初作出了从阿富汗撤军的决定。国际舆论认为这不失为一个明智之举，给予了应有的评价。
    但是，苏军的撤退并不能立即导致阿富汗悲剧的结束。
    去年初，有关各方在日内瓦谈判期间，美方曾要求在苏联撤军后，苏美双方都不再向各自支持的一方提供军援。但是苏联一直以对喀布尔政权“负有义务”为由予以拒绝。华盛顿的分析家们推测：苏军撤出后，喀布尔政权很可能在少则几周、多则几个月内或被用武力推翻、或从内部瓦解。他们在被撵出喀布尔之后，可能退踞邻近苏联的阿富汗北部边境地区，依靠苏联的后勤供应和苏联境内的苏联空军的支援，继续负隅顽抗。在这种情况下，美国势必继续向抵抗力量提供军援。这样，以苏联及其庇护下的纳吉布拉的武装力量为一方、抵抗力量及其美国支持者为另一方的冲突仍将继续下去。苏美间的这场争斗仍不能算结束。
    华盛顿的分析家们也认为，对美国来说，另一种现实的危险是，在外患尚未根除的情况下，阿富汗抵抗力量各派之间由于政见分歧、教派矛盾以及某些外部的影响，不能迅速组成一个基础广泛、牢固的临时联合政府，从而在一段时期内将出现政局混乱的局面，甚至爆发一场内战。这就不仅将使数百万难民不能早日返回家园、复兴经济，而且会给亲苏势力以可乘之机。
    美国目前正在密切关注着阿富汗的事态发展。但是，种种迹象表明，华盛顿对此有鞭长莫及之感。布什总统虽在就职后不久说过，在苏联撤军后，美国将对阿富汗的和平与稳定起一种“催化剂”的作用，但国务院的有关负责官员无法具体说明这一作用如何起法。美国官方一再声称，美国不打算插手阿富汗内部事务，选择什么样的政府应由阿富汗人民自己决定。《纽约时报》２月５日的一篇文章就此写道：“即使美国企图左右那里的局势，它对抵抗力量的巨大投资也不一定能获得忠诚的保证，或者得到这样的承诺：不管最终控制局面的是什么样的政府，它（对美国）都将是友好的。”
