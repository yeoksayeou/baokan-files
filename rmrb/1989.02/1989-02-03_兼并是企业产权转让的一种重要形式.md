In a socialist commodity economy, the transfer of enterprise property rights takes various forms, such as the transfer of idle machinery and equipment, certain industrial patents, trademark rights, and so on. However, the transfer of enterprise property rights (overall property rights) is of significant importance. The transfer of an enterprise's overall property rights can be achieved through the reorganization of property rights by purchasing another enterprise's shares with its own assets—this form of property rights transfer does not change the legal status of the acquired enterprise. It can also be achieved through mergers and acquisitions, such as the auctioning and purchasing of enterprises. The merger and acquisition form of enterprise property rights transfer has appeared in Beijing, Shanghai, Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Hebei, Hubei, Guangdong, Fujian, Sichuan, Gansu, Inner Mongolia, and other provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions since 1986, and is currently in full swing.

The merger and acquisition form of property rights transfer is a necessary result of deepening reforms

Mergers (mergers) differ from amalgamations. Mergers are a form of enterprise property rights transfer where one enterprise is absorbed and the other is dissolved. Once the property rights (or ownership) of the acquired enterprise are transferred to another party, the enterprise's legal status is terminated, and the original independent economic and legal entity is "absorbed" by the other party. Therefore, mergers are essentially one party absorbing the other.

Mergers were once considered a phenomenon unique to capitalist commodity economies. This traditional view no longer holds in the new situation of the development of socialist commodity economies. Practice has shown that mergers are not necessarily capitalist in nature. It can be said that they are a form of enterprise expansion in a developed commodity economy and are therefore a necessary form of enterprise expansion in a socialist commodity economy.

The reasons for the emergence of the merger phenomenon in China's current economic life are as follows:

(1) The need to achieve industrial rationalization and enhance competitiveness. The further development of the socialist commodity economy and the more extensive role of the market mechanism will inevitably lead to more intense competition. In the fierce market competition, those enterprises that are poorly managed, heavily in debt, and operate on a self-sustaining basis will naturally seek to sell part or all of their enterprise property rights to find a new way out. On the other hand, enterprises with advantages will naturally be willing to acquire the assets of other enterprises at a lower price to strengthen their own production capacity, adjust the technical structure and labor organization within the enterprise, promote industrial rationalization, reduce costs, and enhance the market competitiveness of existing products and the development of new products. It can be seen that through mergers to carry out enterprise adjustments and expansions, it has become a necessary result of competition.

(2) The need to further develop economic associations and establish enterprise groups. With the further development of horizontal economic associations between enterprises, loose associations will gradually transform into tighter associations to reorganize production factors within the association and form new production capabilities. Currently, some enterprise groups in various places have already established joint-stock companies in the core layer or carried out mergers to form tighter associations. This indicates that the transfer of enterprise property rights is a requirement for the further development of economic integration.

(3) The need to adapt to the policy of opening up and revitalization. The large-scale transfer of enterprise property rights on an international scale is a new phenomenon in the international economy since the Second World War and is a necessary product of the internationalization of the economy and the expansion and strengthening of the international circulation of capital. To seek the benefit of relatively low comparative costs, enterprises need to set up factories and operate abroad, especially the fluctuation of exchange rates and the appreciation of the domestic currency, which prompt enterprises in developed countries to invest and set up factories in countries with cheap raw materials and labor, and to acquire local enterprises. This international transfer of property rights is not only beneficial for the optimal combination of production factors on an international scale, but for economically underdeveloped countries, it is also a means of introducing funds and technology. China is currently implementing the development strategy of coastal areas. Some enterprises in coastal areas are trying to develop exports and earn foreign exchange through mergers, and some enterprises are also setting up branches overseas, while inland enterprises are setting up factories in coastal areas to expand their product market share at home and enter the international market. In addition, to introduce funds and technology, it is also necessary to allow foreign capital to invest and set up factories in the country.

(4) The need to deepen the reform of the enterprise operating mechanism. In China's implementation of the enterprise contract responsibility system, leasing system, and stock system, the autonomy and entity of enterprises have been further strengthened, and the self-awareness of enterprises has thereby sprouted and awakened. They actively take measures to expand their production capacity, adjust the production technology structure, form the necessary scale benefits, and develop diversified operations, while those enterprises that are poorly managed urgently need to get out of the operational and financial difficulties, and thus the forms of "enterprise contracting enterprises" and mergers and acquisitions of enterprise property rights have emerged.

In summary, the emergence of the merger form of autonomous property rights transfer is not accidental; it is a necessary result of the deepening development of China's reforms.

The merger of enterprises has important practical significance for the current rectification of the economic environment

The merger of enterprises is a major reform measure with significant positive significance. Preliminary practices in various places have shown that enterprise "mergers" play an important role in optimizing the combination of production factors in state-owned enterprises, eliminating losses, and improving the micro and macro benefits of capital use.

(1) Mergers are an effective form of eliminating the weak and strengthening the strong. The traditional method of closing and merging enterprises is difficult to fundamentally reform poorly managed enterprises because the original cadres are on an equal footing when forming a new enterprise and leadership team. While mergers, through the strong absorbing the weak, digesting and reforming the weak, and using the weak to supplement the strong, not only strengthen and develop the material foundation of the strong, but also reform and utilize the production capacity of the weak, thus significantly improving enterprise efficiency. In Baoding, the adoption of mergers of strong enterprises with weak enterprises eliminated losses in state-owned enterprises in 1987. In 1987, 5 out of 6 loss-making enterprises that were merged in Chongqing turned losses into profits in the same year. Currently, there are a large number of idle or semi-idle fixed assets in the field of state-owned enterprises in China. Enterprises with good efficiency lack the ability to expand production, while enterprises with poor efficiency occupy a large amount of fixed assets and working capital and continue to rely on state financial subsidies. To solve this contradiction and achieve micro-adjustments to supplement the weak with the strong, this is the economic root of the emergence and rise of the transfer of the overall property rights of enterprises.

(2) Mergers are an effective form of achieving production concentration to realize scale benefits. Modern production methods are always manifested in large-scale production and its scale benefits, and thus require a certain degree of production concentration. In China's original enterprise organizational structure, there are a large number of medium and small enterprises, many of which have poor equipment, outdated technology, and a material foundation that urgently needs to be strengthened. In recent years, during the reform, various local and departmental enterprises have set up a large number of medium and small enterprises with their own funds. Due to the result of dispersed investment, a large number of new enterprises lack sufficient fixed assets to form batch production capacity and lack scale benefits. For example, the blind development of the automobile industry in China has resulted in more than 100 automobile parts processing plants nationwide, with small enterprise scales, backward equipment, and low production capacity, resulting in a lack of efficiency. These long-term loss-making enterprises have become a heavy burden on the state's finances. Based on the above situation, the current enterprise reform needs to achieve production concentration through the expansion of enterprise scale and the adjustment of enterprise organizational structure. Of course, production concentration can also be achieved through the development of horizontal associations and equal "enterprise mergers." The development of mutual equity participation and the establishment of joint-stock companies is a good way to achieve production concentration. However, mergers are also an indispensable and very effective method.

(3) Mergers, through the adjustment of the internal structure of existing enterprises and the optimal combination of production factors, can fully utilize the benefits of capital stock without increasing the total amount of capital. Mergers are a form of enterprise structural adjustment to supplement the weak with the strong. Through mergers, people adjust the product structure, enterprise structure, and industrial structure according to the requirements of the expansion of strong enterprises, taking a certain product as the "dragon head," and transform the idle and stagnant funds of weak enterprises into fully effective funds. In Qingdao, the introduction of the merger mechanism in the contract system promoted the adjustment of product structure and enterprise scale operations, accelerated the elimination of obsolete products, and developed famous and high-quality products. In 1987, the number of loss-making enterprises decreased by 40%, and the loss amount decreased by 74.22%. Here, the enhancement of enterprise production capacity and economic benefits is achieved through the readjustment of the internal production organization and technical structure of enterprises and the optimal combination of production factors, rather than through the addition of new investments. Therefore, it is a form of internal expansion of reproduction within society. Its advantage is that it greatly saves new investments within the national economy, and society can thus use new investments for urgently needed key sectors such as energy, transportation, and education. In China's current situation of urgent need for reform and shortage of funds, many basic materials are in short supply, especially facing the threat of inflation, vigorously developing mergers to promote production development and structural adjustment will be a feasible method to achieve stable economic growth.

In summary, the autonomous transfer of enterprise property rights in the form of mergers reflects a mechanism of self-adjustment, self-enrichment, and mutual supplementation of enterprise entities in a socialist commodity economy. This form of enterprise property rights transfer, on the one hand, plays a powerful role in eliminating the weak and strengthening the strong; on the other hand, it is a gentle and less socially disruptive elimination mechanism. It not only opens up a new path for revitalizing state-owned enterprises but is also a method of realizing the high-efficiency utilization of asset stock. In this way, the utilization efficiency of the social asset stock is greatly improved, as if there has been a new investment of fixed assets. In China's current period of rectifying the economic environment and controlling the growth of fixed asset investments, fully utilizing the enterprise merger mechanism has important practical significance.

Correctly observing and treating mergers and properly adjusting the interests of both parties

There are still different understandings of mergers among people at present. Some comrades still regard mergers as a category of capitalist competition, viewing it as the strangulation of small enterprises by monopolistic organizations, as "big fish eating small fish." They believe that mergers are incompatible with socialism.

"Mergers" are not a phenomenon that originated from capitalism; it is a very ancient phenomenon that has existed since there has been a commodity economy. For example, in ancient China, since the Qin and Han dynasties, with the commodification of land, there has been the occurrence of land mergers, although it is not purely an economic merger, but to a large extent, it is achieved through the administrative coercion of the feudal regime. Of course, mergers are a form of competition and enterprise expansion in developed capitalist countries. In capitalist commodity economies, mergers have a dual nature: on the one hand, they represent the strangulation of small capital by large capital, especially monopoly capital, that is, what people call "big fish eating small fish"; on the other hand, mergers realize the optimal combination of production factors, that is, what people call "industrial rationalization." It shows the development of socialized production and is a form of economic progress. Therefore, people should not simply regard mergers as a negative phenomenon.

As a form of enterprise self-adjustment and self-expansion in a developed commodity economy, mergers will also appear in a socialist commodity economy. This inter-enterprise merger and property rights transfer does not change the nature of public ownership and does not change the original position of the workers as masters. Therefore, people should not regard it as an anti-socialist enterprise behavior.

From the current specific practices in various places, in the case of mergers, the transfer of property rights has the following specific methods:

(1) Free transfer of operating rights. Severely loss-making enterprises on the verge of bankruptcy, under the condition that the merging party assumes its debts, freely transfer its operating rights or ownership. When mergers occur within the scope of state-owned enterprises, the object of transfer is only the operating rights, and there is no transfer of enterprise ownership, thus not affecting the state's property rights.

(2) Paid transfer of ownership. When mergers occur between state-owned enterprises and collective-owned enterprises, it is a transfer of ownership. However, as a special commodity, this transfer of property rights should follow the principle of equivalent exchange in commodity exchange and should be subject to the guidance of the state plan. Therefore, this guided paid merger will not damage or weaken state property.

The above methods of mergers will not affect the position of the workers as masters. Because after the enterprise is merged, the merging party assumes the responsibility of arranging the employment of the enterprise's workers, the retirement benefits of retired workers, and other welfare benefits, therefore, their living conditions will be improved.

The above situation shows that mergers based on public ownership in a socialist context have basically eliminated the antagonistic nature of capitalist mergers. Through its complementary role, the proper handling and arrangement of various relationships, it is beneficial to both parties. Therefore, when observing and treating mergers, people should start from reality and adopt a new way of thinking, rather than regarding it as a "ugly" capitalist enterprise behavior.

To ensure the smooth implementation of mergers, it is also necessary to appropriately handle the contradictions of interests between the two parties. For example, in the current mergers of state-owned enterprises, due to the inaccurate valuation of assets and the inability to implement equivalent paid transfers of property rights, there are phenomena of property rights being infringed upon and interest contradictions between various property rights subjects in different ownership systems. In addition, the merging party and the merged enterprise, due to the inability to break the original block relationship, have different wages, labor protection, and welfare benefits after the merger, resulting in interest differences and contradictions, and so on. Therefore, relevant departments must formulate correct policies and properly adjust the interests of both parties in the merger to realize the socialist nature of mergers based on public ownership, thereby fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of both parties.

In addition, after the merger, a few strong enterprises, due to the expansion of production scale, the improvement of production capacity, the reduction of product costs, and the increase in product quantity, gradually occupy a larger advantage in the market, even squeezing out competitors. In a socialist commodity economy, if an enterprise or a few enterprises are the only ones, due to the lack of competition, there will also be the phenomenon of monopoly prices, which not only will cause price increases and infringe on the interests of consumers but also will not be conducive to technological progress and the improvement of management. Therefore, taking measures to prevent the monopoly of production and the market is also a problem that must be solved in the implementation of socialist mergers.

　　兼并是企业产权转让的一种重要形式
    刘诗白
    在社会主义商品经济中，企业的产权转让具有多样形式，如闲置的机器设备的转让，某些工业发明权的转让，商标权的转让，等等。但是，具有重要意义的是企业产权（整体产权）的转让。企业整体产权转让，既可以通过企业以自己的资产购买另一企业的股权的产权重组方式——这种产权转让不改变被参股企业的法人身份，也可以通过企业拍卖与购买等兼并的方式来进行。企业产权转让的兼并形式，自１９８６年以来，先后出现在北京、上海、辽宁、黑龙江、河北、湖北、广东、福建、四川、甘肃、内蒙古等省、市、自治区，正处于方兴未艾之中。
        　　产权转让的兼并形式是改革深化的必然结果
    兼并（ｍｅｒｇｅｒ）与合并不同。兼并是产权转让中的企业一兴一灭的形式，被兼并一方的财产占有权（或是所有权）一旦转让给他人，企业的法人资格也就宣告结束，原先作为独立的经济实体和法律实体的企业，也就为对方“吞并”，因而，兼并实际上是一方吃掉一方。
    兼并曾经被人们视为是资本主义商品经济中特有的现象，这种传统观念，在社会主义商品经济发展中出现的新情况下已经站不住脚了。实践表明，兼并并不一定姓“资”，可以说，它是发达的商品经济中企业扩展的一种方式，因而，它也是社会主义商品经济中企业扩展的必要形式。
    我国当前经济生活中的企业兼并现象之所以产生，是由于以下的原因：
    （１）实现产业合理化和增强竞争力的需要。社会主义商品经济的进一步发展和市场机制更充分的发挥作用，竞争也就会更加激烈，在尖锐的市场竞争中，那些经营不善、负债累累而又实行自负盈亏的企业，自身就要求出售部分企业产权或出售企业整体产权来谋取新的出路。另一方面，拥有优势的企业，自然是愿意以较低的价格，购买对方的财产，以充实自身的生产能力，进行企业内部的技术结构与劳动组织的调整，促使产业的合理化，降低成本，增强原有产品的市场竞争能力和新产品的开发。可见，通过兼并来进行企业调整和企业扩展，就成为竞争的必然结果。
    （２）进一步发展经济联合体和组建企业集团的需要。随着企业间的横向经济联合的进一步发展，松散的联合总是要逐步转化为紧密的联合，以便在联合体内实行生产要素的重新组合和形成新的生产能力。当前各地的一些企业集团，已经在核心层组建股份制的公司，或是实行兼并以组成更紧密的联合体。这表明，企业产权的转让，乃是经济联合化更深入发展的要求。
    （３）适应开放、搞活的需要。企业产权大规模地在国际范围内的转让，是第二次大战后国际经济的一个新现象，是经济国际化，资本的国际流通扩大和加强的必然产物。为了谋求比较成本低的利益，企业要在国外设厂、经营，特别是汇率的变动，本国货币的升值，促使发达国家企业到原料、劳动力便宜的国家去投资、设厂，购买当地企业。这种国际间的产权转让，不仅有利于生产要素在国际范围内优化组合，对于经济不发达国家来说，它还是引进资金和技术的一种形式。我国当前正在实行沿海地区发展战略，沿海地区的一些企业，力图通过兼并，发展出口创汇，还有一些企业还要到海外去设置分厂，而内地企业也要到沿海地区去设厂，扩大自己产品在国内市场上的阵地和打入国际市场。此外，为了引进资金、技术，也要允许外国资本到国内来投资、设厂。
    （４）深化企业经营机制改革的需要。我国在实行企业承包经营制、租赁制、股份制的企业改革中，企业自主权和实体性进一步增强，企业的自主意识由此萌发和苏醒，它们积极采取措施，扩充其生产能力，调整生产技术结构，形成必要的规模效益和发展多种经营，而那些经营不善的企业则迫切需要摆脱经营与财务上的困境，因而，出现了“企业承包企业”和兼并等企业产权转让形式。
    总之，产权自主转让的兼并形式的出现，完全不是偶然的，它是我国改革深化发展的必然结果。
    　　　　企业兼并对当前治理经济环境具有重要的现实意义
    企业兼并是一项具有重大积极意义的改革措施。各地的初步实践表明，企业“兼并”在促使全民所有制企业生产要素优化组合、消灭亏损、提高资金使用的微观效益与宏观效益等方面起了重要作用。
    （１）兼并是优胜劣汰，以劣补优的一种有效形式。传统的关停并转的企业合并方式，由于合并双方处于权利平等地位，在组建新企业，形成领导班子时，原有干部平起平坐，因而难以对经营不善的企业实行根本改造，让其补充优势企业。而兼并，通过优者吃掉劣者，消化、改造劣者，以劣服从和补充优，既加强与发展有优势的一方的物质基础，又改造与发挥了处于劣势的一方的生产能力，因而，它能使企业的效益大大提高。保定市由于采取了优势企业兼并劣势企业，１９８７年国营企业消灭了亏损。１９８７年重庆市６家被兼并的亏损企业，在兼并后当年就有５家扭亏为盈。我国目前国营企业领域存在大量固定资产闲置或半闲置，效益好的企业缺乏扩大再生产的能力，而效益差的企业却占用大量固定资产与流动资金，并不断依靠国家财政补贴。为了解决这一矛盾和实现以劣补优的微观调整，这正是当前企业整体产权转让产生和兴起的经济根源。
    （２）兼并是实现生产集中以发挥规模效益的一种有效形式。现代生产方式总是要表现为大生产及其规模效益上，因而它要求一定的生产集中。我国原有的企业组织结构中，存在着大量的中小企业，许多企业的设备很差，技术落后，物质基础急需加强。近年来在改革中，各地方、部门用自己支配的资金上了一大批中小企业，由于投资分散化的结果，大量新企业的固定资产不足而形不成批量生产能力，缺乏规模效益。例如我国汽车行业盲目发展，全国办起的汽车零配件加工厂有１００多个，企业规模小，装备落后，生产能力低，从而缺乏效率，这些长期亏损的企业成了国家财政的沉重负担。基于上述情况，当前的企业改革，有必要通过生产集中化，扩大企业规模，调整企业组织结构。当然生产集中还可以通过发展横向联合，通过平等的“企业合并”来实现。发展企业互相参股，组建共同持股的股份公司，就是实现生产集中的一种好方法。但是兼并也是一种不可缺少的和十分有效的方式。
    （３）兼并借助于现有企业内在结构的调整与生产要素的优化组合，可以在不增加资金总量的条件下，充分发挥资金存量的效益。兼并是一种以劣补优的企业结构调整，通过兼并，人们按照优势企业扩展的要求，以某一产品为“龙头”，来实现产品结构、企业结构和产业结构的调整，将劣势企业缺乏效益的和呆滞的资金，转化成为具有充分效益的资金。青岛市在承包中引进了兼并机制，促进了产品结构的调整和企业规模经营，加快淘汰了那些滞销品，发展了名优产品，１９８７年亏损户减少了４０％，亏损额下降７４．２２％。在这里，企业生产能力的增强和经济效益的提高，不过是借助于企业内部生产组织和技术结构的重新调整，借助于生产要素的优化组合，而不是来自增加新投资，因而，这是一种社会范围内的内含型扩大再生产。其优点是，它大大节约了国民经济范围内的新投资，而社会可以由此把新投资用于迫切需要的重点部门，如能源、交通、教育等。在我国当前百废待兴，而又资金短缺，许多基本物资匮乏，特别是面临通货膨胀威胁的条件下，大力发展兼并，以此来促进生产发展和结构调整，将是争取国民经济稳定增长的一项可行的方法。
    总之，企业产权自主转让的兼并形式，它体现了社会主义商品经济中的一种企业机体自我调整、自我充实、互相补充的机制。这种企业产权转让形式，一方面，它强有力地起着优胜劣汰作用；另一方面，它又是一种温和而较少引起社会震荡的淘汰机制。它不仅为搞活国营企业打开了一条新的路子，而且是一种实现资产存量高效利用的方法，这样就使社会既有资金存量的利用效率大大提高，有如有了新的固定资产的投入一样。在我国当前治理经济环境，控制固定资产投资增长的时期，充分利用企业兼并机制具有十分重要的现实意义。
    　　　　正确地观察和对待兼并妥善调节兼并双方的利益关系
    对于兼并这一新事物，目前人们还存在不同的认识。一些同志还把兼并视为是资本主义竞争的范畴，当作是垄断组织对于小企业的扼杀，是“大鱼吃小鱼”，他们认为，兼并与社会主义是不相容的。
    “兼并”并不是起源于资本主义，它是自从有商品经济以来就出现了的一个很古老的现象。例如在中国古代，秦汉以来随着土地的商品化，就有土地兼并的发生，不过它不是纯粹的经济兼并，而在很大程度上是借助于封建政权的行政强制。当然，兼并是发达的资本主义国家中的竞争现象和企业扩展的一种形式。在资本主义商品经济中，兼并具有二重性：一方面它体现了大资本特别是垄断资本对小资本的扼杀，即人们说的“大鱼吃小鱼”；另一方面兼并实现生产要素组合的优化，即人们称之为“产业合理化”，它表明了生产社会化的发展，是一种经济的进步，因而人们不能把兼并单纯地看成是消极现象。
    兼并作为发达的商品经济中的一种企业自我调整与自我扩展的形式，它也会出现于社会主义商品经济中。这种企业间的兼并和产权转让，一不改变公有制的性质，二不改变原来职工的主人翁地位，因而人们不应该将它当作是一种非社会主义的企业行为。
    从目前各地的具体作法来看，在实行兼并的场合，产权转让有以下具体方式：
    （１）无偿转让经营权。严重亏损濒于破产的企业，在兼并的一方承担其债务的前提下，无偿地让渡它的经营权或所有权。在兼并发生在全民所有制范围内时，转让的对象只是经营权，不存在企业所有权的转让，从而不影响国家的财产所有权。
    （２）有偿转让所有权。在兼并发生在全民所有制和集体所有制之间时，它是所有权的转让，但是作为特殊的商品，这种产权转让应该遵循商品交换的等价原则，并且要从属于国家的计划指导。因而，这种有指导的有偿兼并，不会破坏与削弱国家财产。
    兼并的上述方式均不会影响企业职工的主人翁地位。由于企业被兼并后，兼并者承担安排企业职工的就业、退休职工的退休金和其他福利，因而，他们的生活状况还将由此得到改善。
    以上情况表明，发生在公有制基础上的社会主义兼并，基本上摆脱了资本主义兼并所固有的对抗性质，它以其互补作用，各种关系的妥善处理与安排，从而有利于双方。因此，人们在观察和对待兼并时，应该从实际出发，采用新的思维方式，而不能把它视为一种“丑恶的”资本主义企业行为。
    为了使兼并顺利进行，还需要恰当地处理好双方利益的矛盾。例如，当前国营企业兼并中，由于资产估价不确实，产权不能贯彻等价有偿转让，而在各种所有制之间，也存在着各个产权主体之间产权被侵犯的现象和利益矛盾。再有，兼并者和被兼并企业，因原有条块关系未能打破，在兼并后工资收入、劳保福利方面各不相同而存在利益的差别和矛盾，等等。可见，有关方面必须制定正确的方针，妥善调节兼并双方的利益关系，才能实现公有制基础上的兼并的社会主义性质，从而使双方的劳动积极性得到最充分的发挥。
    此外，兼并后少数优势企业因为生产规模的扩大，生产能力的提高，产品成本的降低和产品数量的增多，它逐步在市场中占有更大优势地位，甚至排挤了竞争者。在社会主义商品经济中，如果企业只此一家或几家，由于竞争的缺乏，也就会出现垄断价格的现象，它不仅会引起价格上涨，侵犯消费者的利益，而且也不利于技术的进步与经营管理的完善。因此，采取措施防止生产与市场的垄断，这也是实现社会主义兼并所必须注意加以解决的问题。
