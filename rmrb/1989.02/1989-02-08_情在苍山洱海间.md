In recent years, young dancer Yang Liping has been creating and rehearsing diligently between performances. She has finally produced a dance show with a distinctive style and unique character. During her visit to the Philippines, her performance was praised as "one of the highest-level performances at the Philippine Cultural Center in recent years." Subsequently, she traveled to Japan and was acclaimed for her delicate performance and free-spirited dance style. In Beijing, the enthusiastic response from the full-house audience further confirmed her success.

With the support of her dance partner Song Qingji, Yang Liping performed ten works, including "Three Colors of Xishuangbanna," "Magic Ankle Bells," "Hunting Love," "Spring Rice Song," "Rain Threads," "Tremble," "Fire," "Search," and "The Spirit of the Bird," which won her the double crown for creation and performance at the second national dance competition and left the audience spellbound. These works vividly showcase the unique dance styles and emotions of various ethnic groups in Southwest China, such as the Dai, Yi, Dong, Wa, Jingpo, and Hani. It is evident that Yang Liping, born in Dali, Yunnan, to a Bai ethnic family, although appearing calm and detached, harbors a deep affection and burning passion for her homeland. This profound love for her native soil keeps her from being swayed by the current stage trends of intense stimulation and turmoil, allowing her to remain devoted to the songs and dances of her hometown. Perhaps it is this intense emotion that makes her dance not as delicate and gentle as the mist and willows of the Cangshan Mountains and Erhai Lake, but rather deep, solemn, and fiery, even carrying the raw and unrefined charm of awakening wisdom. This not only shows that her dance roots run deep and are richly nourished but also seems to blur the boundaries between history and reality, life and art—pure ancient customs, the spring of life, and the wine of art are all seamlessly integrated.

Yang Liping's dance form is both rigorous and free. When rigorous, every detail is meticulously crafted, giving the impression that adding more would make it too broad, and subtracting would make it too narrow (as seen in "The Spirit of the Bird" and "Three Colors of Xishuangbanna"). When free, it seems unbound by rules, unrestricted by rhythm, capable of both contraction and expansion, narrow or wide (as seen in "Rain Threads" and "Fire"). During performances, she follows the rhythm of her emotions, displaying the unconstrained charm of an artist improvising poetry on the spot. This harmonious blend of rigor and freedom, rules and improvisation, makes her dance lively and flexible, with a rhythm that is both tense and relaxed, and emotions that are unrestrained and profound, adhering to principles without being stiff, and moving freely.

The charm of Yang Liping's dance, in the words of experts, also lies in her outstanding dance sense. For a dancer, this is a rare artistic talent. Every inch of her skin seems to speak, as if each piece can recite beautiful poetry. Her arms, down to her five fingers, and even each joint of her fingers, can express extremely subtle dance movements, like five strings of a lute that can produce unbelievable vibrations and flashes.

However, perhaps because Yang Liping pursues simplicity too much, or because she is still too young, she has not fully utilized her dance potential in some works. This results in some performances, such as "Tremble," "Search," and even the highly dance-oriented "Magic Ankle Bells," appearing somewhat casual and loose, failing to give the audience a perfect dance impression and aesthetic satisfaction.

　　情在苍山洱海间
　　赵国政
    近年来，青年舞蹈家杨丽萍在频繁演出之余，潜心创作，默默苦耕，终于形成了一台个性鲜明、独具风格的舞蹈晚会。在赴菲律宾访问演出中，人们赞美她的演出是“菲律宾文化中心近年来最高水平的演出之一”。接着东渡日本，又以她的表演细腻、舞风洒脱载誉东瀛。在北京的舞台上，从观众爆满，喝采不止的强烈反响中，更印证了她的表演是成功的。
    杨丽萍在舞伴宋庆吉的得力配合下共演出了十个作品，有：《版纳三色》、《神奇的脚铃》、《猎中情》、《春米谣》、《雨丝》、《颤》、《火》、《觅》以及使观众为之倾倒并在全国第二届舞蹈大赛中摘取创作、表演双重桂冠的《雀之灵》，分别漾溢着我国西南地区傣、彝、侗、佤、景颇、哈尼等族的民族风韵和有别于其它任何地区的独特的舞蹈情绪。不难看出这位出生在云南大理的白族姑娘，尽管外表上给人一种性情恬静、处世淡然的感觉，但内心里却对生养她、哺育她的故土积蓄着深深的迷恋，燃烧着炽热的激情。这种深沉的乡土之恋，使得她不被当今舞台上富有刺激的狂劲和颠簸所迷惑，而依然醉心于她故乡的歌、家乡的舞。或许正是这种情感太浓重了的缘故，使得她的舞蹈远不像苍山洱海间烟花薄雾、细柳拂风那样的浅淡与轻柔，而是深沉的、凝重的、热辣的，甚至带有民智初开、浑莽朴厚的原生情调。这不仅说明她的舞根须扎得深厚，蕴藉饱满，同时也似乎使她的舞模糊了历史与现实的界限，模糊了生活与艺术的边缘——纯正的古风、生活的泉水、艺术的美酒浑然一体了。
    杨丽萍的舞蹈形式是严谨的，同时也是自由的。严谨时丝丝入扣，给人以增之则显太宽，减之则嫌太窄的感觉（如《雀之灵》、《版纳三色》等）。自由时，则似无定约，不拘平仄，能收能放，可窄可宽（如《雨丝》、《火》等），表演时全凭情感的跳动和驱驰，又显示出艺术家那种临场吟诗无拘无束的神采。这种严谨与自由的相辅相成，规范与即兴的交互运用，使她的舞形式上活泼自如，节奏上张弛错落，情感上酣畅淋漓，法度上严而不僵，驰骋自若。
    杨丽萍舞蹈的迷人之处，用行家话讲，还在于她出色的舞蹈感觉。对于一个舞蹈演员来说，这是一种难得的艺术天赋。布满在她身上的肌肤，好像每一片都会讲话，都能吟咏出悦耳的诗句似的。她的双臂，一直到五个手指，乃至每个手指的每个关节，都能表现出极其细微的舞蹈功能，像五根琴弦一样可以发出令人难以置信的震颤与频闪。
    不过，或许是由于杨丽萍过分地追求质朴，或许是因为她毕竟还太年轻，本应充分发挥舞蹈功能的时候却没有充分的发挥出来。致使有的作品，如《颤》，如《觅》，甚至舞蹈性极强的《神奇的脚铃》，都显得有些随意和松散，未能让观众获得完美的舞的印象和审美的满足。（附图片）
