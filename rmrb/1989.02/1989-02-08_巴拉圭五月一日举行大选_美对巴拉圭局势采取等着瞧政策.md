Paraguay to Hold Elections on May 1
U.S. Adopts a Wait-and-See Policy on Paraguay's Situation

		ASUNCION, Paraguay, Feb. 6 (Xinhua) -- Paraguay's interim President Andres Rodriguez signed a decree today announcing that Paraguay will hold general elections on May 1 this year to elect a president and members of both the Senate and the House of Representatives. This is the first time Rodriguez has specified a date for the elections since he overthrew the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner in a military coup on Feb. 2.

		The decree dissolves the Senate and House of Representatives, which had been manipulated by Stroessner, and invalidates all the members elected in the February 1988 elections.

		The decree also stipulates that the term of the newly elected president and legislators will end on Aug. 15, 1993.

		The decree states that the elections are being held to "create a peaceful atmosphere and mutual tolerance among all sectors of society."

		WASHINGTON, Feb. 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said today that the nature of U.S.-Paraguay relations will depend on the actions of Paraguay's new government.

　　巴拉圭五月一日举行大选
　　美对巴拉圭局势采取等着瞧政策
    新华社布宜诺斯艾利斯２月６日电  亚松森消息：巴拉圭临时总统安德烈斯·罗德里格斯今天签署法令，宣布巴拉圭将于今年５月１日举行大选，选举总统和参、众两院议员。这是罗德里格斯将军２月２日发动军事政变推翻斯特罗斯纳独裁政权后，第一次明确规定大选日期。
    法令决定，解散一直被斯特罗斯纳操纵的参、众两院，取消去年２月大选时选出的全部议员的资格。
    法令还规定，新当选的总统和议员的任期将到１９９３年８月１５日为止。
    法令说，举行大选是为了“创造和平气氛和社会各阶层之间的相互容忍”。
    新华社华盛顿２月６日电美国国务院发言人雷德曼今天说，美国同巴拉圭关系的性质要看巴拉圭新政府行动而定。
