The Leading Group for Economic Development in Poor Areas of the State Council held its seventh plenary meeting on February 1 to analyze the current situation of economic development in poor areas and to deploy the main tasks for the next two years. The meeting announced that despite the current tight financial and credit situation, the State Council has decided that the funds allocated for poverty alleviation will not be reduced.

The meeting noted that economic development in poor areas has achieved significant results. According to statistics, by the end of 1988, 60% of the impoverished households supported nationwide had solved their food and clothing problems, and one-quarter of the key counties supported by the state had solved their food and clothing problems first. The new problems facing the current situation are: first, the remaining impoverished population that has not yet solved their food and clothing problems is mainly concentrated in areas with harsh natural conditions and low social development levels. Although the number of impoverished households has decreased, the difficulty of poverty alleviation has increased. Solving the food and clothing problem is now entering the most difficult stage of the battle. Second, although some impoverished counties have solved their food and clothing problems, the standards are very low and unstable, and the level of social productivity has not fundamentally changed. The gap with developed areas continues to widen. To truly form self-development capabilities and get rid of poverty, continued support is necessary. Under this situation, the main task for the next two years of the "Seventh Five-Year Plan" is to take further effective measures, concentrate forces, and fight a decisive battle to solve the food and clothing problem. On this basic premise, support the impoverished counties that have crossed the food and clothing line to achieve a strategic shift from supporting thousands of households to solve the food and clothing problem to developing regional economies, entering a new stage of poverty alleviation and prosperity.

The new measures proposed by the meeting for the next two years mainly include: the special interest-free loans for poverty alleviation in the latter half of the "Seventh Five-Year Plan" will be organized by the counties for recovery and turnover, continuing to be used for poverty alleviation and development projects; a certain amount of plastic film and fertilizer will be specially allocated, and matched with good seeds and technology, to expand the planting area of hybrid corn with plastic film, and to quickly solve the food problem of impoverished households in high-cold mountainous areas and arid regions; funds will be allocated to implement the policy of using low-grade industrial products to replace relief, and to prioritize solving the transportation and drinking water problems for humans and livestock in impoverished areas; further mobilize national ministries and commissions to focus on helping provinces and regions with larger areas of poverty, such as Southwest and Northwest China.

The meeting emphasized that completing the task of economic development in poor areas should be done in two steps: the first step is to strive to solve the food and clothing problem in a relatively short period; the second step is to develop the regional economy through long-term efforts. Counties that have completed the first step must timely transition to the second step of economic development. The basic standard for impoverished counties to solve the food and clothing problem is that in normal years, more than 90% of the impoverished households solve their food and clothing problem. For counties that have solved the food and clothing problem, encouraging policies will be adopted, with the main principle being "two unchanged, one priority," that is, the poverty alleviation funds will not change, the preferential policies will not change, and the use of county-owned enterprise loans will be prioritized. At the same time, it is allowed to adjust the scope of the special interest-free loans for poverty alleviation, which can be used for leading processing projects that can drive impoverished households to develop commodity economies, and to commend these counties and the departments and units that have contributed to their development within the entire society.

The meeting reiterated that all localities and departments must seriously implement the State Council's instructions to bundle various poverty alleviation funds for concentrated use. All poverty alleviation funds and materials must be used according to the principles of "unified planning, overall arrangement, orderly channels, unchanged functions, relatively concentrated, matching use, and each recording its merits."

State Councilor and Director of the Leading Group for Economic Development in Poor Areas, Chen Junsheng, presided over the meeting and delivered a speech.

　　贫困地区经济开发领导小组部署今明两年扶贫工作
    打好解决温饱问题攻坚战
    国务院决定用于扶贫的资金不减少
    本报讯  国务院贫困地区经济开发领导小组于２月１日召开第七次全体会议，分析当前贫困地区经济开发的形势，部署今明两年的主要工作。会议宣布，尽管目前国家财政、信贷资金紧张，国务院决定，用于扶贫的资金不减少。
    会议认为，目前贫困地区经济开发已经取得可喜成绩，据统计到１９８８年底，全国被扶持的贫困户已有６０％解决了温饱问题，有１／４国家重点扶持的贫困县率先解决了温饱问题。当前面临的新问题：一是剩下的尚未解决温饱的贫困人口主要集中在一些自然条件恶劣、社会发育程度较低的地区，虽然贫困户数量减少了，但扶贫难度更大了。解决温饱问题正在进入最困难的攻坚阶段。二是虽然一些贫困县解决了温饱问题，但标准很低，且不稳定，社会生产力水平尚未发生根本变化，与发达地区差距仍在持续扩大，要真正形成自我发展能力，摆脱贫困，必须继续扶持。在这种形势下，“七五”后两年的主要任务是进一步采取有力措施，集中力量，打好解决温饱问题的攻坚战。在这个基本前提下，扶持越过温饱线的贫困县实现从扶持千家万户解决温饱问题向发展区域经济的战略转折，进入脱贫致富新阶段。
    会议就今明两年工作提出的一些新措施主要有：“七五”后两年扶贫专项贴息贷款由县组织回收，周转使用，继续用于扶贫开发项目；专项安排一定数量的地膜和化肥，并和良种、技术配套，扩大地膜杂交玉米种植面积，尽快解决高寒山区和干旱地区贫困户的吃饭问题；安排资金，实行中低档工业品以工代赈，优先解决贫困地区交通和人畜饮水困难；进一步动员国家部委，重点联系帮助西南、西北等贫困面较大的省、区。
    会议强调，完成贫困地区经济开发这一任务要分两步走：第一步争取在较短时间内解决温饱问题；第二步经过长期努力发展区域经济。已经完成第一步任务的贫困县，必须适时转入经济开发的第二步工作。贫困县解决温饱的基本标准是在正常年景下，９０％以上的贫困户解决温饱问题。对解决温饱问题的贫困县要采取鼓励政策，主要原则是，“两不变，一优先”，即扶贫资金不变，优惠政策不变，使用县办企业贷款优先，同时允许其调整扶贫专项贴息贷款使用范围，可以将大部分资金用于能带动贫困户发展商品经济的龙头加工项目，并在全社会范围表彰这些县以及为其发展做出贡献的部门和单位。
    会议再次重申：各地、各部门必须认真执行国务院关于将各项扶贫资金捆起来集中使用的指示，各项扶贫资金和物资都要按照“统一规划、统筹安排、渠道不乱、作用不变、相对集中、配套使用、各记其功”的原则使用。
    国务委员、国务院贫困地区经济开发领导小组组长陈俊生主持会议，并作了讲话。
