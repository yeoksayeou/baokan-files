The Western European automobile market continues to show prosperity in January of this year. According to statistics, during this period, Western Europe (excluding Italy) sold 945,000 vehicles, an increase of 13 percent compared to the same period last year. Italy sold 228,887 vehicles, an increase of 11 percent compared to the same period last year.

Among the four major automobile markets in Western Europe, France's automobile sales grew by 26 percent in January, leading all countries; followed by West Germany, which grew by 22 percent compared to the same period last year; then the United Kingdom, which grew by 12.5 percent; and Italy was at the bottom. The automobile market situation in January this year indicates that the pessimistic predictions made by some experts recently that the Western European automobile market will shrink will not become a reality for the time being.

　　西欧汽车市场呈现兴旺景象
    今年一月西欧汽车市场继续呈现一片兴旺景象。据统计，这期间西欧（不包括意大利）共售出汽车九百四十五万辆，比去年同期增加百分之十三，意大利售出汽车二十二万八千八百八十七辆，比去年同期增加百分之十一。
    在西欧四大汽车市场中，今年一月法国的汽车销售增长百分之二十六，居各国之首；其次是西德，比去年同期增长百分之二十二；再次是英国，增长百分之十二点五；意大利居末位。今年一月汽车市场形势表明，不久前某些专家对西欧汽车市场将出现萎缩的悲观估计一时尚不会成为现实。
