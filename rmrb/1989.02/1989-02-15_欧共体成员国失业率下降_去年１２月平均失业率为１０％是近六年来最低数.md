The unemployment rate in the European Economic Community (EEC) member states has decreased. The average unemployment rate in December 1988 was 10%, the lowest in nearly six years.

According to a report from our correspondent Wei Wei in Brussels on February 14, the EEC Statistical Office announced on February 13 that the average unemployment rate in the member states in December 1988 was 10%, the lowest since the summer of 1983.

The unemployment rate in the EEC peaked in the autumn of 1984 at 11%. It was 10.9% in both 1985 and 1986, and it dropped to 10.4% in August 1988.

Looking at individual member states, since the end of 1985, the unemployment rates in Spain, Portugal, Ireland, the United Kingdom, and Belgium have shown a downward trend. For example, Ireland's unemployment rate decreased from 19.1% to 17.6% in 1988, and the UK's rate fell from 10.7% to 8.6% in 1988. The unemployment rates in France, West Germany, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg have remained relatively stable in recent years, at 10.9%, 8.1%, 11.7%, and 1.6% respectively. However, the unemployment rates in Denmark and Italy have increased, with Denmark's rate rising from 7.5% to 8.4%, and Italy's from 14.2% to 16.4%.

Currently, the unemployment rate for women in the EEC is 13.4%, and the youth unemployment rate (under 25 years old) is even higher, at 20.2%. The total number of unemployed people in the EEC is still nearly 15.9 million. Officials from the EEC Commission believe that although progress has been made in improving employment, the EEC and its member states still need to work together to create more job opportunities.
