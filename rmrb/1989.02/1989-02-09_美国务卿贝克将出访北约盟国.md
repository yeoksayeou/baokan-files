U.S. Secretary of State Baker to Visit NATO Allies

The U.S. State Department announced on February 7 that Secretary of State Baker will begin an eight-day "whirlwind" working visit to fifteen member countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) starting on February 10.

During this period, Baker will meet with the foreign ministers of these countries and some of their heads of government to exchange views on a series of issues within NATO.

Analysts point out that the newly appointed Baker chose to visit individually rather than meeting with allied foreign ministers at a NATO conference, aiming to establish personal connections with his NATO colleagues. Additionally, Baker intends to coordinate positions with the allies before meeting with Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze in March and resuming the Vienna talks on conventional arms reduction.

### 美国务卿贝克将出访北约盟国

　  美国务卿贝克将出访北约盟国
    美国国务院七日宣布，国务卿贝克将于本月十日开始对十五个北大西洋公约组织成员国进行为期八天的“旋风式”工作访问。
    在此期间，贝克将会见这些国家的外交部长和其中一些国家的政府首脑，以便就一系列北约内部的问题广泛交换意见。
    分析家指出，新上任的贝克选择单独访问的形式，而不是在北约会议上会见盟国外长，是想与他的北约同僚建立私人联系。此外，贝克也有意在今年三月会见苏联外长谢瓦尔德纳泽、重开维也纳常规武器裁军谈判之前与盟国协调立场。
