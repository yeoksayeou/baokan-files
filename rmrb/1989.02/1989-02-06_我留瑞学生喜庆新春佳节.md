On the eve of the Spring Festival, nearly 200 Chinese visiting scholars, students, and their family members in the Stockholm area gathered at the education section of the Chinese Embassy in Sweden to celebrate the festive occasion.

Everyone watched a videotape of the New Year's Eve gala from back home and a newly released domestic film. They also danced to lively music and played games.

Chinese Ambassador to Sweden, Tang Longbin, and his wife attended the party. Ambassador Tang briefed the students on the domestic and international situation and encouraged them to excel in their studies, return home early to contribute their youthful talents, and make contributions to the country's reform and modernization.

During this festive time, overseas students deeply missed their homeland and families. In their conversations, the hottest topic was the economic and political reforms in China. Yang Xiaohua from the Meteorology Department of Uppsala University said, "We are most concerned about the domestic reforms. Everyone hopes for the success of the reforms and the progress of the motherland." Many scholars and students expressed that they hope the knowledge they gain abroad can be useful for the country's modernization. They will closely link their careers with the country's cause. Some students said: "The material living conditions at home are poor, but we are fully prepared for this. It doesn't matter, but we hope to have a better environment for our studies."

Chinese scholars and students in the other six cities in Sweden also held Spring Festival celebrations. Everyone raised their glasses to toast the success of the country's reforms and prosperity.

　　我留瑞学生喜庆新春佳节
    本报斯德哥尔摩２月４日电  春节前夕，在斯德哥尔摩地区的中国访问学者、留学生及家属近２００人欢聚在我驻瑞典大使馆教育处，共度新春佳节。
    大家观看了从国内寄来的元旦联欢节目的录相和新拍的国产电影，还在轻快的音乐声中翩翩起舞，做游戏。
    中国驻瑞典大使唐龙彬夫妇参加了联欢会。唐大使向留学人员介绍了国内外形势，勉励他们学业优异、早日回国施展青春才华，为祖国的改革和四化建设做出贡献。
    在喜庆春节之际，海外学子们倍加思念生养自己的祖国和亲人。在他们的交谈中，最热门的话题是祖国的经济、政治体制改革。来自乌普萨拉大学气象系的杨小华说：“我们最关心的是国内的改革，大家都盼望着改革成功，祖国进步。”很多学者、留学生都表示，他们希望自己在国外学到的知识能对国内四化建设有用。他们将把自己的事业与祖国的事业紧密联系在一起。有的留学生表示：国内物质生活条件差，我们是有充分准备的，这没关系，但希望在学业上能有个较好的环境。
    在瑞典其他６个城市的中国学者、留学生也都分别举行了春节联欢活动。大家举杯共祝祖国改革成功，繁荣昌盛。
