	Romania is strengthening the recycling and utilization of waste materials to reduce its dependence on imported raw materials. This year's economic and social development plan stipulates that the country will meet the demand for raw materials in the national economy by recycling and utilizing waste materials.

	Romania plans to recycle and utilize an amount of waste steel equivalent to five times the annual iron ore mining output, an amount of copper equivalent to the annual copper ore production, and an amount of lead and zinc equivalent to one-third and one-quarter of the annual mining output, respectively.

	Romania has established a strict set of recycling and utilization systems. Each factory and enterprise must formulate a recycling plan at the beginning of each year and sign a delivery contract with the local recycling center.

	Currently, Romania mainly recycles and utilizes waste metals, paper, plastics, glass, and tires. Each county and the capital city of Bucharest have a waste material recycling and utilization center. Every year, various waste materials from factories, enterprises, and the public are sorted, cut, crushed, and packaged by these centers before being sent to steel mills, paper mills, glass factories, and other facilities.

　　罗加强废旧材料的回收利用
    新华社布加勒斯特２月１３日电  为减少对进口原材料的依赖，罗马尼亚今年的经济社会发展计划规定，将加强对废旧材料的回收利用来满足国民经济对原材料的需求。
    罗马尼亚１９８９年计划回收利用的废钢铁将相当于本国铁矿年开采量的５倍、铜将相当于铜矿一年的产量、铅和锌分别相当于全年开采量的１／３和１／４。
    罗马尼亚制定了一整套严格的回收利用制度。各工厂企业每年年初必须订出回收计划，并同当地回收中心订出上交合同。
    罗目前主要回收利用废旧金属、纸张、塑料、玻璃、轮胎等。目前，全国各县及首都布加勒斯特市都有一个废旧材料回收利用中心，每年，来自工厂企业和民间的各种废旧材料经它们分类、切割粉碎，打包后就送往各钢铁厂、造纸厂、玻璃厂等。
