According to calculations by the Purple Mountain Observatory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, a total lunar eclipse will occur from the evening of February 20 (the fifteenth day of the first lunar month) to the early morning of February 21, and it will be visible from all parts of China.

The specific times for this lunar eclipse are as follows: the beginning of the partial eclipse at 21:44, the start of the total eclipse at 22:56, the maximum eclipse at 23:35, the beginning of the end of the eclipse at 00:15 on the 21st, and the end of the partial eclipse at 01:27.

There will be two lunar eclipses this year. The other one will occur on August 17, but it will not be visible from China.

According to calculations, approximately every sixteen or seventeen years, there is a possibility of experiencing a lunar eclipse during the full moon phase of two or three consecutive first lunar months. However, it is very rare for this to occur on the night of the Lantern Festival. The last time a total lunar eclipse was visible in China on the night of the Lantern Festival was on February 10, 1971. The next opportunity to see a total lunar eclipse on the night of the Lantern Festival will be on March 4, 2007.

　　元宵巧遇月全食    赏灯观月两相宜
    本报讯  据中国科学院紫金山天文台计算，２月２０日（农历正月十五）至２１日凌晨将发生月全食，我国各地都能看到。
    这次月全食的具体时间是：初亏２１时４４分，食既２２时５６分，食甚２３时３５分，生光２１日零时１５分，复圆１时２７分。
    今年内将发生两次月食，另一次是８月１７日的月全食，在我国看不到。
    据测算，大约每十六七年内，有可能连续两三个正月“望”时出现月食，但很少可能出现在元宵之夜。上次我国在元宵之夜看到月全食是１９７１年２月１０日，下次看元宵之夜的月全食则要到２００７年３月４日。
