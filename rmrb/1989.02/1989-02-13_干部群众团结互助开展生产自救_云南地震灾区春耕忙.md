Cadres and masses in the earthquake-stricken areas of Yunnan Province, facing the devastating test of the disaster, have united in mutual aid to launch production self-rescue. After hastily setting up anti-earthquake shelters, the disaster victims have actively engaged in repairing agricultural and water conservancy facilities, and expanding the cultivation of sugarcane, tea, and other economic crops. Currently, all areas have fully transitioned into spring farming. The disaster victims are enthusiastic about production, and the situation is unexpectedly good.

Lancang Lahu Autonomous County, located in a severely affected area, has 29 reservoirs and 3,036 irrigation canals destroyed by the earthquake. After the earthquake, repairs were immediately carried out. Except for a few reservoirs, all were basically restored by the eve of the Spring Festival. Another severely affected county, Gengma Dai and Wa Autonomous County, saw a reduction in irrigation canals due to the earthquake. However, in the village of Mengsheng in Pusaishan Township, behind the village, three springs gushed out from the Eight Great Mountains, flowing down three large gullies. The villagers joyfully dug a 5-kilometer-long irrigation ditch to bring the spring water into the village. When the reporter visited this village, the villagers had already plowed and soaked 600 mu of land, preparing to transplant early rice. The early rice seedlings that had been raised earlier were green and vigorous.

During the reporter's visit to the earthquake-stricken areas, it was observed that the disaster victims were full of enthusiasm to achieve a bumper harvest of grain and economic crops this year. When asked what was most urgently needed at the moment, almost all the disaster victims said they lacked hybrid rice seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, and small agricultural tools such as hoes and shovels. Some said, "We are powerless in this regard and hope the government can help solve these problems."

　　干部群众团结互助开展生产自救    
    云南地震灾区春耕忙
    据新华社昆明２月１２日电（记者谭亚原、张殿光）云南省地震灾区的干部群众面对毁灭性灾害的考验，团结互助，开展生产自救。灾民们匆匆建起防震棚后，就积极投入修复农田水利设施，扩种甘蔗、茶叶等经济作物。目前，各地已全面转入春耕生产。灾民们生产热情高涨，形势出人意料的好。
    地处重灾区的澜沧拉祜族自治县有２９座水库、３０３６条水渠被震毁。震后，各地立即抢修。除个别水库外，到春节前夕已基本修复。另一个重灾县——耿马傣族佤族自治县，水渠受震减少。但是，这个县的四排山乡勐省村后面的八大山上，却震出了三股泉水，沿着三条大沟哗哗流下，村里人欣喜若狂，震后开引水沟５公里多，将泉水引进寨子。记者到这个村采访时，村民们已经翻犁、泡田６００多亩，准备栽插早稻。先育的早稻秧苗青绿茁壮。
    记者在地震灾区采访中看到，灾民们为夺取今年粮食和经济作物丰收干劲十足。记者问灾民眼前最紧缺什么？几乎都说缺杂交稻种、化肥、农药和锄、锹等小农具。有人说：“这些我们无能为力，希望政府帮助解决。”
