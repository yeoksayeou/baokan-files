Shamir with Black Sunglasses

Reported by Lin Jiaoming, Correspondent of This Newspaper

Israeli Prime Minister Shamir does not wear glasses. However, in a recent satirical comedy performed in Israel, Shamir not only has severe nearsightedness but also wears a pair of non-transparent black sunglasses. This portrayal of Shamir is meaningful. He ignores global structural changes, denies the fundamental shift in the PLO's strategy, and stumbles around, insisting on going in circles in a dead-end alley. What is the difference between this and wearing black sunglasses that block his vision?

On February 1, Shamir proposed a two-phase "new peace plan." Its main points are: in the first phase, Israeli troops will withdraw from parts of the cities in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, moving to designated areas, and implement a 5-year period of Palestinian "autonomy." In the second phase, after the 5-year transition period, Israel will hold unconditional direct talks with local Palestinians and relevant Arab countries, but "will not negotiate with the PLO," and the status of the West Bank and Gaza Strip will be determined by the outcome of the talks.

Interestingly, within less than a month, several Israeli "plans" have emerged. Previously, on January 10, Shamir, in an unusual move, agreed to link direct Arab-Israeli talks with "UN supervision." On January 20, Defense Minister Rabin also proposed a "four-point plan," which is similar to Shamir's plan: holding elections in the West Bank and Gaza Strip under "international supervision," with elected representatives negotiating with the Israeli authorities to implement "broad autonomy." The West Bank and Gaza Strip will either form a federation with Israel or Jordan in the future, while Jewish settlements will remain, and Israel will retain "defense sovereignty."

Within a few hours of Shamir's "new" plan being announced, it was clearly rejected by the PLO. The PLO spokesman Rahmeh advised him "not to play with that old stuff again." In fact, whether it is Shamir's plan or Rabin's plan, they both emphasize the implementation of "autonomy" in the occupied territories. The Middle East plan with "autonomy" as its core has been seen many times before. Mr. Shamir mistakenly takes old goods for new ones, either because his eyesight is poor or because he has already "put on black sunglasses."

In fact, what Prime Minister Shamir has finally dug out from his old boxes is still old goods, and it is also a matter of necessity. It is not fair to say that he ignores everything. He knows that the U.S.-PLO dialogue has begun; he also understands that Western European countries are urging him to sit at the negotiating table with the PLO; even news from Britain that the U.S. and the Soviet Union have a timetable for the Middle East conference, he immediately reacts. However, to the active responses of the PLO, such as the PLO's unilateral recognition of Israel's right to exist, the strong call for resolving the Arab-Israeli dispute through negotiations to establish a Palestinian state and realize national self-determination, Shamir pretends not to hear, deliberately using black sunglasses to cover his eyes. This is purely self-deception!

The humor of the Jewish people is sometimes quite biting. In the comedy, when Shamir is asked by an ophthalmologist whether he would rather have his eyes completely covered, how does he respond? "No. It would be better if there were plugs to block my ears as well." The audience roared with laughter. I wonder what the Israeli Prime Minister in reality thinks about this. Does he really want to become a "lonely individual" who is both blind and deaf in politics?

### 戴上黑眼镜的沙米尔

　　戴上黑眼镜的沙米尔
    本报记者　林皎明
    以色列总理沙米尔不戴眼镜。但最近在以色列国内公演一出相当叫座的讽刺滑稽戏中，沙米尔不仅深度近视，而且还戴上一副不透光的黑眼镜。给沙米尔这份扮相是意味深长的。他无视全球格局性的变化，否认巴解组织战略的根本改变，跌跌撞撞硬要在一条死胡同里打转，这与戴上障目的黑眼镜有何区别？
    ２月１日，沙米尔提出一份两阶段“和平新计划”。其内涵大致是：第１阶段，以色列军队从约旦河西岸、加沙地带的部分城市撤出，转移到指定地区，实施５年时间的巴勒斯坦人“自治”；第２阶段，５年过渡期后，以色列与当地巴勒斯坦人和阿拉伯有关国家举行无条件直接谈判，但是，“绝不同巴解组织谈判”，约旦河西岸、加沙地带的地位由谈判结果决定。
    有意思的是，不到１个月时间，以色列“方案”就出笼了好几个。在此之前，１月１０日，沙米尔一反常态，同意将阿以直接谈判与“联合国主持”挂钩。１月２０日，拉宾国防部长也抛出一份“４点计划”，内容与沙米尔计划大同小异，即在“国际监督下”进行约旦河西岸加沙地带选举，由选出代表与以色列当局谈判，实行“广泛自治”。西岸和加沙地带今后或与以色列、或与约旦结成邦联，而犹太人定居点维持不动，“国防大权”由以色列独揽。
    沙米尔的“新”计划出笼不到几小时，就遭到巴解组织的明确拒绝。巴解组织发言人拉赫迈奉劝他“不要再摆弄那点陈货”。其实，沙米尔计划也好，拉宾方案也罢，都强调要在被占领土实行“自治”。而以“自治”为核心的中东方案早已屡见不鲜，沙米尔先生错把旧货当新货，不是眼神儿不济，就是已经“戴上了黑眼镜”。
    其实，沙米尔总理翻箱倒柜最后抖弄出来的还是旧货，也是形势所迫。说他无视一切，有欠公允。美巴对话业已开始，他是知道的；西欧国家促他与巴解组织坐到一张谈判桌前，他也明白；甚至从英国传出美苏两国已有一张中东和会时间表，他都立刻有所反应。然而，对于巴解组织的积极反应，例如，巴解组织单方面主动承认以色列国的生存权利，强烈呼吁通过谈判解决阿以争端，以建立巴勒斯坦国实现民族自决等等，沙米尔却假装听不见，有意以黑眼镜遮住眼睛。这纯属自欺欺人！
    犹太民族的幽默有时是相当辛辣的。在滑稽戏中，沙米尔被眼科大夫诘问到是否索性把眼睛蒙死更舒服时，你猜他怎么回答？“不。要是有塞子把耳朵也堵死才好。”剧场中哄堂大笑。不知现实中的以色列总理对此有何感想，难道他真想成为政治上又瞎又聋的“孤家寡人”吗？
