	Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, which has achieved a bumper grain harvest for 11 consecutive years, has seen a surge in various industries due to abundant grain supplies. This has also led to a thriving market scene in both urban and rural areas.

	Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, the Party and government leaders in Xinjiang have consistently prioritized grain production. The region's grain output has increased year by year, with total production rising from 322 million tons in 1977 to 584.32 million tons in 1987, and reaching 606 million tons in 1988. The per capita grain availability in the entire region has consistently exceeded the national average for several years; over the past four years, 95 million tons of grain have been exported.

	The continuous increase in grain production has driven and promoted the rapid development of various industries that use grain as raw materials. By the end of 1987, the entire region had 1,420 food industry enterprises across 18 categories, including confectionery, canned goods, brewing, dairy products, and grain and oil processing, with a total output value of 1.448 billion yuan, second only to the petroleum and textile industries.

	With the increase in grain production and the development of the feed industry, Xinjiang's breeding industry has become increasingly prosperous, with poultry farms, pig farms, fish farms, and dairy farms, as well as specialized households, spread across various regions.

	Due to the bumper grain harvest and ample meat supply, the catering industry in Xinjiang has seen a booming development. Nowadays, whether in urban areas, rural towns, or along transportation routes, the problem of difficulty in finding food has been resolved.

　　新疆粮食增产带动各业迅速发展
　　城乡市场呈现一派繁荣景象
    据新华社乌鲁木齐２月５日电  （记者汪有富）连续１１年夺得粮食丰收的新疆维吾尔自治区，由于粮食充足，不仅促使食品工业、饲料工业、养殖业、饮食业、粮食加工业，及多种经营得以蓬勃发展，而且城乡市场呈现一派繁荣景象。
    党的十一届三中全会以来，新疆党政领导部门对粮食生产一直抓得很紧。全自治区粮食生产年年上升，总产量由１９７７年的３２２万吨提高到１９８７年的５８４．３２万吨，去年达到６０６万吨，全自治区人均粮食占有量连年超过全国平均水平；近４年调出粮食９５万吨。
    由于粮食连年增产，带动和促进了以粮食为原料的其它行业的迅速发展。据１９８７年底统计，全自治区已拥有糖果糕点、罐头、酿酒、乳制品、粮油加工等１８个门类的食品工业企业１４２０个，总产值１４．４８亿元，仅次于石油纺织工业。
    随着粮食增产和饲料工业的发展，新疆的养殖业越来越兴旺，养鸡场、养猪场、养鱼场、奶牛场，专业户遍布各地。
    由于粮食丰收，肉食供应充足，饮食业在新疆出现了蓬勃发展的好势头。如今，无论城镇乡间还是交通沿线，人们吃饭难的问题已不复存在。
