The Hebei Province Xinglong County Tax Bureau has implemented an open tax collection system, strengthened internal and external supervision mechanisms, and empowered the public to measure the performance of tax officials. This has made the supervision and inspection mechanisms both effective and sensitive, effectively addressing the issue of improper practices within the industry.

The Xinglong County Tax Bureau has 170 employees. In the past, some tax officials exhibited varying degrees of using their power for personal gain, accepting bribes, and other unethical behaviors. The root cause of these issues was the lack of transparency in tax laws, regulations, and collection procedures, which the public was unaware of. To rectify this situation, the bureau has clearly stipulated the "six openness" principles: openness in tax policies and regulations, collection management systems, collection and penalty procedures, tax exemptions, tax official discipline, and civilized tax collection standards. They have adopted various methods such as posting notices, distributing handbooks, conducting consultations, holding meetings, and door-to-door propaganda to make this information public, allowing the public to evaluate the performance of tax officials.

After implementing the "six openness" principles, the bureau established a dual supervision system. Internally, the bureau formed a supervision and inspection leadership group, and each subordinate unit set up dedicated inspectors to oversee whether tax officials are correctly implementing policies, whether collection procedures are standardized, and whether their work is conducted honestly. Externally, the bureau appointed over 80 part-time inspectors, established a system where the bureau chief receives visitors, and set up a reporting system with reporting boxes in all towns and cities, and dedicated reporting hotlines within the bureau and its subordinate units.

The implementation of open tax collection and dual supervision has significantly curbed improper practices within the county's tax system. Incidents of extortion, bribery, and other unethical behaviors among tax officials have greatly decreased. There have been numerous instances of officials refusing meals and gifts. Over the past year, the bureau received over 300 letters from the public, exposing and addressing four cases of official misconduct, receiving 120 suggestions for improving tax work, and correcting 130 issues. Tax officials refused bribes 14 times and declined invitations to eat 122 times.

　　让群众掌握衡量砝码　使监督检察机制显效
　　兴隆县税务局治理行业歪风
    本报讯  河北省兴隆县税务局实行公开办税制度，强化内外监督体系，让群众掌握衡量税务干部的砝码，使监督检察机制既有效又灵敏，有力地治理了行业上的不正之风。
    兴隆县税务局有干部职工１７０人，过去，在一些税务人员中，不同程度地存在着以权谋私、以业谋私，白吃、白喝、白拿及索贿受贿等现象。造成不正之风肆虐的原因，主要是有关税法、规定和办税制度群众不了解，透明度不高，缺乏行之有效的监督检察机制。为了改变这种状况，他们明确规定，全县税务系统实行税收政策法规、征收管理制度、征管处罚、减免征收税、税务干部纪律、文明征税标准等“六公开”。并采取张贴上墙、印发专册、开展咨询、召开会议、上门宣传等多种形式，公布于众，让群众掌握衡量税务干部工作干得好与坏的标准。
    有了这“六公开”以后，这个局又建立了双向监督体系。系统内部，局里成立了监督检察领导小组，局下属各单位设立了专职监察员，负责监督检查税务人员执行政策是否正确、征管是否合乎规范、工作是否廉洁等。系统外部，一是聘请了８０多名兼职监察员；二是建立局长接待日制度，接待群众来信来访；三是建立了举报制度，在全县城镇设置了举报箱，局及下属单位内专门设立了举报电话。
    公开办税、双向监督的实施，使得全县税务系统不正之风明显收敛，税务人员中索、拿、卡、要现象大为减少，还出现了不少请吃不到，送礼不收的好人好事。去年以来，共收到群众来信３００多封，揭露、处理干部违纪问题４起，提出改进税务工作意见１２０多条，纠正问题１３０个。税务人员拒收贿赂１４人次，拒绝吃请１２２人次。
