The State Council Office recently issued an urgent notice on further strengthening summer grain and oil production, requiring all regions to seize the opportunity to strengthen spring field management and strive for a bumper harvest despite disasters.

The notice points out that the area of summer grain and oil crops has increased this year, and the current seedling growth in most regions is better than last year. The overall situation is good. However, drought conditions persist in some regions, and pest and disease outbreaks are expected to be severe. Therefore, the notice requires that all regions must focus on disaster resistance and strive for a bumper harvest, and cannot relax even if the current seedling growth is good. They must manage spring field operations according to local conditions, time, and seedling growth. Strengthen pest and disease forecasting and reporting, prioritize prevention, and implement comprehensive control measures.

The notice also requires that all levels of government mobilize and organize the efforts of various departments to go deep into the grassroots, genuinely help farmers solve various practical problems in production. At the same time, they should combine the "Harvest Plan" and other relevant scientific and technological promotion projects, implement technical services and material supply together, and ensure that all yield-increasing measures are effectively implemented. The agricultural materials departments must strictly follow the contracts and price policies to do a good job of material supply for spring production, and not delay agricultural operations.

　　国务院办公厅紧急通知各地    
    不失时机抓好春季田间管理
    本报讯  国务院办公厅最近发出关于进一步抓好夏季粮油生产的紧急通知，要求各地不失时机地抓好春季田间管理，立足抗灾夺丰收。
    通知指出，今年夏季粮油作物面积有所增加，目前大部分地区苗情长势好于上年，总的形势是好的。但部分地区旱情仍未解除，预测病虫危害偏重。据此，通知要求，各地必须立足抗灾夺丰收，不能因目前苗情长势较好而有丝毫的松懈。要因地因时因苗抓好春季田间管理。加强病虫预测预报工作，以防为主，综合防治。
    通知还要求各级政府动员、组织各部门的力量，深入基层，切实帮助农民解决生产中的各种实际问题。同时，要结合“丰收计划”和其他有关科技推广项目，实行技术服务与物质供应相结合，使各项增产措施真正落到实处。农资部门要严格按合同、按价格政策做好春季生产的物资供应工作，不得贻误农时。
