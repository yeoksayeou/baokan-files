Despite the unrelenting efforts by the police to crack down on the illegal sale of train tickets in front of Beijing Station, scalpers are still rampant, and their activities are on the rise. Last year, 1,700 cases of illegal ticket sales were handled, more than double the number in 1987, and 1,700 scalpers were caught.

According to the police, 50% of the scalpers come from Zhejiang, Anhui, and the Northeast, 25% are local unemployed individuals, and the rest include government officials, college students, workers, and actors. Among the scalpers from other provinces, many have become "professional ticket scalpers." They rent rooms in areas like Babao Mountain and Shuang Bridge, taking the train to Beijing Station every day to buy tickets, claiming they are going to work. A farmer from Feicheng County, Shandong, named Lü Cunmin, has been detained four times for scalping tickets. He said, "I don't do any other work; I only sell tickets." A farmer from Inner Mongolia named Wang Weiquan came to Beijing to do business in clothing but saw the profit in scalping tickets and switched to being a scalper.

The Beijing Station Public Security Bureau and the Beijing Railway Public Security Section have both established special police teams to primarily combat scalpers, effectively stopping scalpers from operating in front of the ticket windows at Qianmen, Dongdan, and Caishikou. However, the scalpers at Beijing Station have come up with new tricks to evade detection. They hide the tickets in post offices, restaurants, hotels, and other places, and after agreeing on a price with the buyer, they leave Beijing Station to complete the transaction, avoiding police surveillance. Some even form gangs, with one person attracting buyers and a few others keeping watch. As soon as they see the police, they flee immediately.

The head of the Beijing Station Public Security Bureau, Zhao Guangheng, analyzed that the reason scalping activities are so rampant is not only due to the tight transportation situation but also because there are too many loopholes, providing scalpers with a source of tickets. A worker from the Beijing Transportation Company's Eighth Workshop, Wei Wenqi, colluded with a ticketing clerk to scalp over 9,000 tickets, earning more than 22,000 yuan. Additionally, there have been isolated incidents at Beijing Station where ticket clerks have colluded with scalpers to sell tickets illegally. Zhao Guangheng believes that to effectively stop scalping activities, the public security, joint defense, Beijing Station, and ticketing contract units must take joint action.

### 倒爷新招迭出　漏洞堵不胜堵  北京站前倒票活动屡禁不绝

　　倒爷新招迭出　漏洞堵不胜堵
    北京站前倒票活动屡禁不绝
    本报讯  尽管警方从未间断过打击北京站前倒卖火车票活动，但此地的票贩子仍活动猖獗，倒票活动且呈上升趋势。去年查处非法倒卖火车票案达１７００余起，比１９８７年增加了一倍多，查获倒票人员１７００余人。
    据警方透露，倒卖火车票人员中，５０％来自浙江、安徽和东北，２５％是本市的无业人员，此外还有机关干部、大学生、工人、演员。外地来京的票贩子中，不少人已成了“倒票专业户”，他们租住在八宝山、双桥等地的农民房里，每天乘车到北京站购票，自称是来上班。山东肥城县农民吕存民因倒卖车票，先后被拘留４次，他说：“我什么活也不干，只会倒票。”内蒙古农民王维权来京做服装生意，见倒票有利可图，便改行做票贩子。北京站公安分局和北京铁路公安段都专门成立了以打击票贩子为主要任务的干警队伍，基本制止了前门、东单和菜市口售票窗前票贩子的活动。但北京站广场的票倒爷们新招迭出，极力逃避追究。他们把车票藏在邮局、饭馆、旅店等处，同买主谈妥价钱后，离开北京站进行交易，避开警方视线。有的还结成团伙，一人招揽买主，几人站岗望风，一见警察立即逃走。
    北京站公安分局负责人赵广恒分析，倒票活动屡禁不绝，除了客运紧张之外，更重要的一个原因，就是漏洞较多，给票贩子提供了票源。北京市运输公司八场修理工魏文起和该场订票员勾结，倒票９０００余张，获利２２０００多元。另外，北京站也曾发生过极个别售票员与票贩子合伙倒票的事情。赵广恒认为，要坚决制止倒票活动，必须由公安、联防、北京站和订票合同单位采取联合行动。
