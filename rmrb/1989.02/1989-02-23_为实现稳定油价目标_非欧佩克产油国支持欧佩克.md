For the goal of stabilizing oil prices, non-OPEC oil-producing countries support OPEC.

According to Xinhua News Agency, London, February 21, some non-OPEC oil-producing countries held a one-day meeting here today and issued a statement saying that the majority of the representatives of the countries present agreed to "reduce their oil exports by a clear percentage" in the second quarter of this year to support OPEC in achieving the goal of stabilizing oil prices.

This is the second meeting this year for non-OPEC oil-producing countries to support OPEC. According to informed sources from the meeting, the main topic discussed was the possibility of non-OPEC oil-producing countries reducing their oil exports by 5%. Experts from Angola, China, Egypt, Malaysia, Mexico, Colombia, and Oman attended the meeting. Observers from Norway, the Soviet Union, the Yemen Arab Republic, the U.S. state of Alaska, and the Canadian province of Alberta also attended the meeting.

The meeting statement said that the experts for the first time explicitly identified the $18 per barrel oil price set by OPEC as a "common goal"; representatives of some countries agreed to freeze their oil exports at the current level, while others expressed the need for further consultation after returning to their countries.

Yang Anding, senior advisor to the China National Chemical Import and Export Corporation, attended the meeting as the Chinese representative. He told a Xinhua News Agency reporter, "China attaches great importance to cooperation with non-OPEC oil-producing countries and supports OPEC's efforts to stabilize oil prices. To this end, China agrees to reduce its oil exports in coordination with relevant countries."

    据新华社伦敦２月２１日电  部分非石油输出国组织（欧佩克）石油生产国的专家，今天在这里举行一天会议后发表公报说，多数与会国家的代表同意“按照一个明确的百分比”削减本国今年第二季度的石油出口，以实际行动支持欧佩克实现稳定油价的目标。
    这是今年以来非欧佩克石油生产国为支持欧佩克而举行的第二次专家会议。据会议消息灵通人士透露，这次会议讨论的主题议题是，非欧佩克石油生产国将石油出口削减５％的可能性。出席这次会议的有安哥拉、中国、埃及、马来西亚、墨西哥、哥伦比亚和阿曼的石油专家。挪威、苏联、阿拉伯也门共和国、美国阿拉斯加州和加拿大阿尔伯塔省派观察员出席会议。
    会议公报说，与会专家第一次明确将欧佩克确定的１８美元一桶的油价当作“共同目标”；少数与会国的代表同意将本国石油出口冻结在目前的水平上，另一部分代表表示要回国后进一步协商。
    中国化工进出口总公司总经理高级顾问杨安定作为中国代表参加了会议。他对新华社记者说，“中国非常重视同非欧佩克产油国的合作，支持欧佩克稳定油价的努力。为此，中国同意与有关国家一道削减本国的石油出口”。
