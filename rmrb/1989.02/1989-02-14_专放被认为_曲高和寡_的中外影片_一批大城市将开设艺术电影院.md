A number of major cities will establish art-house cinemas

	BEIJING, Feb. 13 (Xinhua) -- Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and other economically and culturally developed major cities will establish art-house cinemas to screen domestic and foreign films with strong artistic value.

	This decision was made by the China Film Corporation at a recent meeting of managers from film companies across the country. Art-house cinemas will also be established in Chengdu, Wuhan, Chongqing, Guangzhou, Shenyang, Xi'an, and Nanjing, totaling 11 locations.

	Art-house cinemas have long been established in many developed countries. This is the first time that art-house cinemas will be formally established in China. These cinemas will provide screening venues for domestic and foreign films that are considered "highbrow" but rich in exploratory spirit and artistic pursuit, thereby meeting the needs of different levels of audiences.

　　专放被认为“曲高和寡”的中外影片   
    一批大城市将开设艺术电影院
    新华社北京２月１３日电  北京、上海、天津等经济、文化发达的大城市将开设艺术电影院，专门上映艺术性较强的中外影片。
    这一决定是中影公司在最近召开的全国各省、市电影公司经理会议上做出的。开设艺术电影院的还有成都、武汉、重庆、广州、沈阳、西安、南京等地，计有１１家。
    艺术电影院在许多发达国家早有建立。在我国正式开设艺术电影院还是首次。这些电影院将为那些被称为“曲高和寡”的但富有探索精神和艺术追求的中外影片提供映出场所，以满足不同层次观众的需求。
