In implementing the strategic plan for the economic development of coastal regions, Beijing's foreign economic and trade activities have rapidly developed. In 1988, the city's export volume exceeded $1 billion, setting a historical record. The city approved 148 foreign-invested enterprises, also a record high. Currently, the total number of approved foreign-invested enterprises in the city has reached 409, with a total agreed investment of nearly $3.9 billion and actual foreign investment of nearly $1.8 billion. In 1988, the city also achieved good results in introducing technology, making overseas investments, and exporting labor services.

Zhang Ming, Director of the Beijing Municipal Commission of Foreign Economic and Trade, said on February 14 that this year's foreign economic and trade work will achieve the following: resolute implementation of rectification and management, and resolute promotion of opening up. Export trade will see sustained and stable growth. In handling foreign-invested enterprises, the city will ensure three "no stops": execution of contracts will not stop, construction of approved projects will not stop, and approval of new projects will not stop.

Under the continued guidance of the strategic thought for the economic development of coastal regions, Beijing has decided to hold the 1989 Foreign Economic and Trade Fair from February 21 to March 2.
