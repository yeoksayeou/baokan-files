Farmers Need Small Agricultural Machinery

A large farmer, Zhu Kaiping, from Shiye Township in our county reported that since last April, he has been trying to raise funds to purchase a small combine harvester, but he has been unable to find one anywhere. By the time the wheat harvest season arrived, the wheat threshing could not keep up, and after a heavy rain, more than 5,000 kilograms of wheat rotted in the field. Over 10,000 kilograms of wheat became moldy and had to be used as feed, resulting in an economic loss of over 6,000 yuan.

In recent years, with the deepening of rural reforms, some large farmers have emerged in the countryside. However, the various supporting services they need are far from adequate. There are 203 households in Shiye Township that contract more than 15 mu of land. These large farmers all, to varying degrees, need various types of agricultural machinery, especially small combine harvesters, but none of them have been able to obtain them. The reasons are as follows:

First, agricultural machinery research and production have hit a low point. Zhenjiang City's agricultural machinery research and production had a certain foundation. The Zhenjiang Agricultural Machinery Research Institute was once one of the four key research institutes in the province, and many agricultural machinery manufacturing enterprises also had considerable strength. However, in the past two years, agricultural machinery research institutions have seen their budgets decrease year by year, leading to financial difficulties and an inability to undertake relevant agricultural machinery research projects. Manufacturing enterprises are also unwilling or unable to accept the production of agricultural machinery products. Currently, 30 small agricultural machinery component factories in Zhenjiang have "divorced" from the agricultural sector. In 1988, the national agricultural machinery fund allocated to our county was only 800,000 yuan, a decrease of 680,000 yuan from 1976. In October 1988, the 2 million yuan allocated by higher authorities to the designated factory, Zhenjiang Thresher Factory, for the production of harvesters had still not been realized by the end of 1988.

Second, large machinery is unaffordable, and small machinery is substandard. Large farmers purchase agricultural machinery entirely based on their own economic strength and can only choose small, low-priced products. It is understood that a medium-sized combine harvester costs 11,000 yuan, and with the matching tractor, it would cost over 31,000 yuan, which farmers cannot afford. However, some small agricultural machinery products are of poor quality. Last year, a farmer in our county bought 2 small combine harvesters, which broke down after 6 days of use.

Third, the supply and marketing channels are not smooth, and farmers have no way to buy agricultural machinery.

This situation, where agricultural machinery production lags behind rural economic reforms, greatly dampens farmers' enthusiasm for farming and is detrimental to agricultural production. The relevant authorities should take measures to solve this problem.

### 种田人需要小型农机具

　　种田人需要小型农机具
    我县世业乡种田大户朱开平反映，他从去年４月起，四处自筹资金购买小型联合收割机，可是到处买不到。到了麦子收割时节，因麦子脱粒跟不上，一场大雨过后，５０００多公斤麦子烂在地里，１万多公斤麦子受潮霉变，只好用作饲料，造成经济损失６０００多元。
    这些年，随着农村改革的不断深化，农村出现了一些种田大户。但是，他们需要的各种配套服务却远远跟不上。世业乡承包１５亩以上的种田大户有２０３户。这些种田大户都不同程度地需要各种农机具，特别是小型联合收割机，但都未能如愿。究其原因：
    一是农机科研、生产落入低谷。镇江市的农机科研、生产原有一定基础，市农机研究所曾是省内４大重点研究所之一，不少农机生产厂家也具有一定实力。但是近两年来，农机科研单位因经费逐年减少，入不敷出，无力承担有关农机的科研项目，生产农机的厂家也不愿或无力接受农机产品的生产。目前，镇江市已有３０家小农机配件厂与“农”字脱钩。１９８８年，国家给我县下拨的农机费只有８万元，比１９７６年减少了６８万元。１９８８年１０月，上级拨给机械电子部定点厂镇江脱粒机厂生产收割机的２００万资金，直到１９８８年底仍没有落实。
    二、大农机具买不起，小农机具不过关。种田大户购买农业机具完全依靠自己的经济实力，一般只能选择小型、价低的产品。据了解，一台中型联合收割机要１１０００元，加上配套的拖拉机，就需３１０００多元，农民承受不了。可是，一些小型农机具，质量又不好。去年，我县有一农户买了２台小型联合收割机，用了６天就坏了。
    三、供销渠道不畅，农民购农机具无门。
    这种农机具生产落后于农村经济改革的现况，极大地挫伤了农民种田的积极性，对农业生产十分不利。主管部门应采取措施，解决这一问题。
