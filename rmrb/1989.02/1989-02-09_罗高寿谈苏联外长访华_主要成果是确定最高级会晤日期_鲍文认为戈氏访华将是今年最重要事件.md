	Ro Gao Shu Discusses Soviet Foreign Minister's Visit to China
	The Main Achievement is to Determine the Date for the Highest-Level Meeting
	Bowen Believes Gorbachev's Visit to China Will Be the Most Important Event of the Year

	New China News Agency, Moscow, February 7 (Reporter Zhu Chengjun) - Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Ro Gao Shu said today at a press conference that the agreement between the Soviet Union and China on the date for the highest-level meeting is undoubtedly the main achievement of Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze's visit to China.

	Ro Gao Shu, who accompanied Shevardnadze on a visit to China earlier this month, also visited Pakistan and returned to Moscow yesterday afternoon.

	Ro Gao Shu pointed out that both the Soviet Union and China believe that "this highest-level meeting will have historical significance, as it marks the complete normalization of Soviet-Chinese relations." In discussing his impressions of the trip, he said, "The long and in-depth conversation with the veteran Chinese revolutionary Deng Xiaoping left the deepest impression on us."

	When discussing international reactions to the talks between the foreign ministers of the two countries, Ro Gao Shu believed that the overall reaction, including from many Western countries, was positive. He said that time has proven that in today's interdependent world, the improvement of relations between two countries does not result in losses for a third country, but benefits everyone. The improvement of relations between the two major countries, the Soviet Union and China, is even more so.

	New China News Agency, Moscow, February 7 - Soviet famous commentator Bowen today published an article in the "News" newspaper, stating that the visit of Soviet leader Gorbachev to Beijing and the complete normalization of Sino-Soviet relations will be the most important event of the year, regardless of whether it is for the Soviet Union or the entire world situation.

	Bowen emphasized the common points between the two countries when discussing Sino-Soviet relations, stating that both countries advocate for a profound reform of international relations, advocate for the continuation of détente, advocate for disarmament, and advocate for the elimination and prevention of local conflicts, allowing the peoples of all countries to determine their own destinies and make historical choices.

	The author wrote that there are still unresolved issues in Sino-Soviet relations. The two countries have different views on certain international issues. However, Sino-Soviet relations will gradually bring their positions closer together and solve these unresolved problems.

    罗高寿谈苏联外长访华
　　主要成果是确定最高级会晤日期
　　鲍文认为戈氏访华将是今年最重要事件
    新华社莫斯科2月7日电（记者竺承军）　苏联副外长罗高寿今天在记者招待会上说，苏中就举行最高级会晤日期达成协议无疑是苏外长谢瓦尔德纳泽访华的主要成果。
    罗高寿随同谢瓦尔德纳泽于本月初访问中国后，又访问了巴基斯坦，于昨天下午返回莫斯科。
    罗高寿指出，苏中双方都认为“这次最高级会晤将具有历史性意义，因为它标志着苏中关系的完全正常化”。他在评述此行的印象时说：“同中国老革命家邓小平同志的长时间、内容深刻的谈话给我们留下了最深的印象。”
    在谈到国际舆论对中苏两国外长会谈的反应时，罗高寿认为，包括许多西方国家在内，总的反应是好的。他说，时间令人信服地表明，在当今相互依存的世界上，某两个国家关系的改善带来的不是第三国受损失，而是大家都获益。苏中两大国关系改善更是如此。
    新华社莫斯科2月7日电苏联著名评论员鲍文今天在《消息报》上发表文章认为，苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫访问北京和中苏关系完全正常化，无论对苏联还是对整个世界形势来说，将是今年最重要的事件。
    鲍文在谈到苏中两国的共同点时强调，两国都主张对国际关系进行深刻的改革，主张使缓和继续下去，主张裁军，主张消除和防止局部冲突，让各国人民自己决定自己的命运，自己作出历史性的抉择。
    作者写道，苏中关系中还存在悬而未决的问题。两国对某些国际问题的看法不尽相同。但苏中将逐步使彼此的立场接近起来，解决这些尚未解决的问题。
