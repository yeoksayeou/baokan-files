OPEC Secretary-General Delivers Speech
Requiring the Stabilization of International Oil Market Prices

The Secretary-General of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Subroto, stated on January 31 at a press conference that the stability of the international oil market depends on effective cooperation between oil-producing and oil-consuming countries.

Subroto arrived in Caracas on January 29 to attend the inauguration ceremony of Venezuela's new president. He mentioned that some ministers from OPEC member countries had just held an informal meeting with the elected president, Perez. The attendees unanimously agreed that OPEC member countries and non-OPEC oil-producing countries need to strengthen cooperation to stabilize international oil market prices. He pointed out that OPEC seeks to stabilize the international oil market, which is beneficial for both oil-producing and oil-consuming countries.

Regarding the suggestion by Venezuela's elected president, Perez, to hold a summit of OPEC member countries' leaders, the Secretary-General said that such a meeting would be conducive to strengthening the unity of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, but necessary preparations are needed. He mentioned that eight ministers from OPEC member countries will meet in March to review the implementation of production quotas and also discuss the timing, location, and agenda for holding the summit.

　　欧佩克秘书长发表讲话
    要求稳定国际石油市场价格
    新华社加拉加斯１月３１日电石油输出国组织秘书长苏布罗托３１日在记者招待会上说，国际石油市场的稳定取决于石油生产国和消费国的有效合作。
    苏布罗托１月２９日抵达加拉加斯参加了委内瑞拉新总统就职仪式。他说，欧佩克一些成员国的部长刚刚同委当选总统佩雷斯举行了一次非正式会议，与会者一致认为，欧佩克成员国和非欧佩克石油生产国需要加强合作，以便稳定国际石油市场的价格。他指出，欧佩克寻求稳定国际石油市场对石油生产国和消费国都有好处。
    这位秘书长在谈到委当选总统佩雷斯建议举行欧佩克成员国首脑会议时说，这样的会议有利于加强石油输出国组织的团结，但需要进行必要的准备工作。他说，欧佩克成员国８位部长将在３月开会，检查成员国生产份额的执行情况，同时也要讨论举行首脑会议的时机、地点和日程等问题。
