The once-struggling "Fruit Kernel Zhang," a fourth-generation family business, has seen a remarkable turnaround after transitioning from a collective enterprise to a private one. Its production and operations have improved dramatically, much like finding a bright path after navigating through a dark forest.

The fourth-generation heir of "Fruit Kernel Zhang," an individual entrepreneur named Zhang Yifeng, faced significant challenges after establishing a collective enterprise with a relevant company in 1986. The enterprise adhered to outdated practices, leading to a rapid increase in management personnel from 2 to 17 and employees from 20 to 66. This expansion resulted in a system where everyone received the same pay regardless of performance, leading to continuous losses totaling over 200,000 yuan. The business was on the brink of collapse.

Towards the end of last year, Zhang Yifeng petitioned the relevant authorities to convert the "Fruit Kernel Zhang" store in Nan Market Food Street into a private enterprise. Under the encouragement of national policies, Zhang Yifeng, as the manager, established 14 regulations to strengthen management. He ensured that procurement of goods and materials was based on quality and price, without favoritism or face-saving measures. He meticulously focused on product quality, implemented a performance-based reward and punishment system for employees, and ensured fair business practices. For any shortages in weight, customers were compensated tenfold, while employees were penalized a hundredfold.

In just two months, the store's reputation soared, with daily sales increasing from around 200 yuan to 2,000 yuan, peaking at 7,000 yuan.

    “果仁张”改私营起死回生
    本报讯  “山重水复疑无路”的“果仁张”，由集体企业转为私营企业后，生产和经营一变而为“柳暗花明”。
    被称为津门一绝的“果仁张”第４代传人、个体经营者张翼峰，１９８６年与有关公司联合办起集体企业后，由于沿袭陈规，副经理及管理人员由开始的２人猛增至１７人，职工由２０余人增至６６人，都吃大锅饭，连续亏损达２０多万元，几乎陷入绝境。
    去年底，张翼峰请示有关部门将南市食品街“果仁张”门市部改成私营企业。在国家有关政策鼓励下，身为经理的张翼峰制定了１４条规章，严格加强管理，进货进料不讲“关系”、“面子”，一概以质论价，抓产品质量一丝不苟；对职工实行多劳多得，严明奖惩；在经营上如发现缺斤短两，对顾客“缺一补十”，对售货员“缺一罚百”。近两个月，这家门市部声誉鹊起，营业额由过去日均２００余元增至２０００元，最高达７０００元。
