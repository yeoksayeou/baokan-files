Some people might think it's an exaggeration to call the production of defective and substandard goods a crime, as there's no such thing as a "crime of producing defective and substandard goods" in the law books.

However, the reality shows that this issue needs to be addressed sharply. The China Quality Management Association recently released figures indicating that defective goods account for 1.51% of the national industrial output value annually. Last year alone, the loss due to defective goods reached 1.83 billion yuan. It is said that this is not a complete statistic. The sheer size of the numbers is staggering. Embezzlement and waste are serious crimes, and producing defective and substandard goods is not the same as embezzlement, but it squanders national resources and wastes precious human, material, and financial resources. Isn't this also a kind of crime?

In social life, some substandard and defective goods are actually disguised as qualified products, which greatly dissatisfies consumers. Before the Spring Festival, the State Bureau of Technical Supervision organized inspections in ten major cities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Harbin, Shenyang, Guangzhou, Xi'an, Chongqing, Wuhan, Nanjing), sampling 1,764 market goods, of which 753 were found to be substandard, accounting for 42.7%! Some of these were electrical appliances and food, directly threatening people's health and safety. Isn't this a crime?

The current problem is that some enterprises and individuals are not aware of this issue. Some knowingly produce substandard goods but take advantage of the shortage of goods, using various improper means to sell them and profit from it. This is a violation of business ethics.

From the perspective of modern commodity economics, a truly sustainable enterprise is one with a good reputation. An enterprise's reputation is built on the credibility of its products and services. Therefore, in enterprise management, there should be this awareness: producing substandard, defective, and waste goods is not only a social crime but also a crime that harms the enterprise itself. Therefore, it is a crime that harms the enterprise's own interests.

To solve this problem, a series of measures must be taken from various aspects. But first, a strong public opinion must be created: producing defective and substandard goods is a criminal act! With strong public opinion pressure, not only will it support the implementation of measures in this regard, but it will also be a widespread supervision of those enterprises that produce substandard, defective, and waste goods. In this regard, relying on their own awareness is not enough.

　　生产废品劣品是犯罪
    江畅
    把生产废品、劣品说成是犯罪，有人会觉得是言之过重了，因为还没见过定谁犯“生产废品劣品罪”呢！
    但是，实际情况表明，很需要这样尖锐地提出问题。中国质量管理协会最近公布了这样的数字：全国每年废品损失占工业总产值１．５１％，去年全年废品损失达１８３亿元。据说，这还是不完全统计。数字之大，令人瞠目。贪污和浪费是极大的犯罪，生产废品劣品不等于贪污，但它糟踏了国家资源，浪费了宝贵的人力、物力、财力，难道不也是一种犯罪！
    在社会生活中，次品、劣品，有的实际上是冒充合格品的废品，更引起消费者的强烈不满。春节前，国家技术监督局部署在十大城市（北京、天津、上海、哈尔滨、沈阳、广州、西安、重庆、武汉、南京）开展市场商品质量抽查、取样１７６４个，有７５３个不合格，竟占４２．７％！其中有的是电器和食品，直接威胁到人的身体健康和生命安全。难道这不是犯罪！
    现在的问题是，有些企业，有些人对此并不觉悟，有的明明知道自己生产的是劣质货，但钻商品短缺的空子，以各种不正当的手段推销，从中渔利。这是违背商业道德的行为。
    从现代商品经济观点看，真正要立足于社会的企业，是有信誉的企业。而有信誉的企业是靠产品的信誉和服务的信誉获得的。因此，在企业管理上也要有这个观念，生产劣品、次品、废品，不仅是社会性的犯罪，就是对本企业而言，也是损害自己生存和发展的，所以也是一种损害自身性的犯罪。
    要解决这个问题，当然要从各方面采取一系列的措施。但首先要造成一种强大的社会舆论：生产废品、劣品是犯罪行为！有了强大的舆论压力，不仅对贯彻这方面的措施是个支持，也是对那些生产次品、劣品、废品的企业的一种广泛的监督。在这方面，光靠他们自觉是不行的。
