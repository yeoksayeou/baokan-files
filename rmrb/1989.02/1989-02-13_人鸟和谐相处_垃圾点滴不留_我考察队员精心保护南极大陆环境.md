	Harmonious coexistence of humans and birds: not a single piece of trash left behind
	Our expedition team meticulously protects the environment of the Antarctic continent

	Xinhua News Agency, Larsemann Hills, February 11 — (Reporter Zhang Jimin) Duck-sized, gray-brown skuas fly in flocks above Zhongshan Station, rising and falling freely. During meal times, these greedy birds often circle around the expedition members, picking at leftovers. Humans and birds coexist harmoniously, each enjoying their own pleasures. This is a daily scene at the Zhongshan Station in Antarctica.

	When the expedition team first arrived at Larsemann Hills, the skuas would fly away in alarm at the sight of people from afar. The expedition members treated them kindly, neither frightening nor capturing them. The skuas gradually became bolder, and they would calmly stay within a meter of people.

	The rocky cliffs near Zhongshan Station are full of weathered rock holes. Walking on the cliffs, one sometimes hears chirping sounds. Looking into the crevices, there are fluffy chicks within reach. However, none of the expedition members have disturbed them.

	The penguins near Zhongshan Station often come in pairs, strutting confidently. Initially, they were very welcome.

	The expedition members are always mindful of protecting the Antarctic environment. Used beer bottles and canned food boxes are all put into bags and sealed. Everyone strictly restricts urination and defecation in the toilets. When going out on expeditions, they carry plastic bags to bring back any waste if necessary. It is understood that the expedition team also plans to handle waste in a non-toxic manner in the future.

　　人鸟和谐相处　垃圾点滴不留    
    我考察队员精心保护南极大陆环境
    新华社拉斯曼丘陵２月１１日电  （记者张继民）像鸭子一样大的灰褐色的贼鸥，成群结队地在中山站上空飞翔，时起时落，自由自在。考察队就餐的时候，这些馋嘴的家伙常常围着考察队员转来转去，拣食残渣剩饭。人鸟和谐相处，各得其乐。这是南极中山站天天可见的场景。
    考察队员刚登上拉斯曼丘陵时，展开双翅的贼鸥老远见到人就惊飞了。考察队员友好地对待它们，不惊吓，不捕捉。贼鸥的胆子便越来越大起来，与人相距一米也悠闲自得了。
    中山站附近的石崖，到处是风化的石窝。在石崖上走，有时会听到咕咕的叫声，顺着石缝往里瞧，里边蹲着毛茸茸的雏鸟，伸手可及。可考察队员谁也没有动它们一下。
    中山站附近的企鹅，经常成双成对大摇大摆地来访，开始很受欢迎。
    考察队员时刻注意保护南极环境。用完的啤酒瓶、罐头盒都装进袋子封好。大家都严格限制在厕所里大小便。外出考察带上塑料袋，以便必要时把粪便带回站上。据了解，考察队还准备日后对垃圾作无毒处理。
