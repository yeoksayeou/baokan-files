Marshal Su Yu's Memoirs of War recently published.
Yang Shangkun inscribed the book title.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 4 (Reporter Xiong Zhengyan) Marshal Su Yu's Memoirs of War has recently been published.

The State Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission, Yang Shangkun, inscribed the book title.

In this nearly 380,000-word work, Su Yu writes from his youth when he joined the revolution, up to the summer of 1949 when he commanded the People's Liberation Army's Third Field Army to cross the Yangtze River and liberate Shanghai. He details his experiences and command of various important battles during the Red Army period, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the War of Liberation. He emphasizes his personal thoughts on tactics and battles under the circumstances of the time, and how to grasp the laws of war to achieve victory. Su Yu once said: "The soul of Mao Zedong's military thought is dialectical materialism." He believed that reducing Mao Zedong's military thought to a few fixed formulas, and simplifying the complex process of war into a brilliant commander's pre-planned scheme, and using these views to educate the next generation, would be fatal in battle. Against this metaphysical and idealist tendency in the military field, despite being in an adverse situation, he resolutely began to conceive this memoir of war, using his rich personal war experience to elucidate the soul of Mao Zedong's military thought, leaving an extremely precious legacy for future generations.

February 5 marks the fifth anniversary of Su Yu's passing.

Guo Huairuo, Peng Deqing, and 21 other old comrades who fought alongside Marshal Su Yu held a meeting to commemorate Su Yu's immortal contributions to the Chinese revolution. Everyone agreed that Su Yu's painstakingly written memoir of war enriches the theoretical treasury of Mao Zedong's military thought and is an excellent textbook for future generations to learn military dialectics.

The Memoirs of War by Marshal Su Yu is published by the PLA Press.

　　粟裕大将战争回忆录问世
　  杨尚昆题写书名
    新华社北京２月４日电  （记者熊铮彦）粟裕战争回忆录最近出版。
    国家主席、中央军委副主席杨尚昆题写了书名。
    在这部近３８万字的著作中，粟裕从青少年时期投身革命写起，至１９４９年初夏指挥人民解放军第三野战军横渡长江，解放上海终卷，详细回忆了红军时期、抗日战争时期和解放战争时期经历及指挥的各次重要战役的情况，着重写了个人在当时形势下对战役、战斗的种种思考，如何掌握战争规律夺取胜利。粟裕生前曾说：“毛泽东军事思想的灵魂是唯物辩证法”。他认为，把毛泽东军事思想归结为几条固定的公式，把错综复杂的战争进程表述为高明的指挥者早就规划好的，并以这些观点去教育下一代，打起仗来是会害死人的。针对军事领域的这种形而上学、唯心主义倾向，尽管他身处逆境，毅然开始了这部战争回忆录的构思，用亲身经历的丰富战争实践，阐明毛泽东军事思想的灵魂，为后人留下了极其宝贵的财富。
    ２月５日是粟裕逝世５周年。
    郭化若、彭德清等当年与粟裕大将一起战斗过的２１名老同志，日前举行座谈，缅怀粟裕对中国革命立下的不朽功勋。大家认为，粟裕呕心沥血写下的这部战争回忆录，丰富了毛泽东军事思想的理论宝库，是后人学习军事辩证法的好教材。
    粟裕战争回忆录由解放军出版社出版。
