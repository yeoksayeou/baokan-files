In the face of a severe situation where the construction environment is being rectified and the scale of construction projects is significantly reduced, Harbin City has taken proactive measures to turn difficulties into opportunities by expanding paths and fully tapping potential.

According to preliminary estimates, the total investment in construction projects in Harbin this year will be reduced by about 500 million yuan compared to last year. It is estimated that in the second half of this year, 30,000 to 60,000 construction workers will be without work, and more than 100 enterprises will face the threat of survival. Additionally, banks have tightened credit, suppressing loans, making construction funds even tighter. Due to the impact of power shortages, the city's red brick production in the first quarter dropped from 300 million bricks last year to 50 million bricks. At the same time, major construction materials such as steel and timber are also in short supply.

Facing numerous difficulties, Harbin has taken the initiative to adopt countermeasures, striving to survive in adversity and seek development amidst tightening measures.

	•	Comprehensive rectification to gradually establish a new order in the construction market. To control the blind expansion of construction teams, Harbin will not approve the establishment of new construction teams starting this year. At the same time, the structure of construction teams will be adjusted, focusing on replenishing short supply professions such as skilled workers, decoration, and plastering. Prices in the construction market will be further stabilized, and material price indices will be published regularly. For materials in short supply, a maximum price will be set, and labor market wages will be limited. Open bidding will be implemented, and for projects with an investment of more than 10 million yuan and a construction area of more than 3,000 square meters, the construction unit will be selected based on merit. Illegal and disorderly behaviors in the construction market will be stopped. Government officials holding positions in companies will be required to resign from one of their positions by the end of the first quarter. Construction units that disclose bidding information and seek kickbacks will be held accountable for economic, administrative, and legal responsibilities.

	•	Deepening reforms to promote the corporate management mechanism reform led by "stockholding system," and actively introducing the risk mechanism. At the same time, focusing on developing the tertiary industry, expanding diversified operations, and undertaking construction tasks in rural areas, allowing surplus personnel to seek their own paths in society.

	•	Strengthening macro-control to create a good construction environment. Insisting on unified planning, development, and construction, changing the current situation of scattered land acquisition and capital loss in the city.

　　广开门路　充分挖潜    
    哈尔滨建筑业在紧缩中求发展
    本报讯  在治理建筑环境，大力压缩基建规模的严峻形势下，哈尔滨市广开门路，充分挖潜，变困难为机遇。
    据初步匡算，今年哈市基建总投资将比去年压缩５亿元左右。预计今年下半年有３—６万建筑职工“没饭吃”，上百个企业面临生存的危机。加之银行抽紧银根，抑制贷款，建筑资金紧上加紧。由于受电力紧张的影响，全市一季度红砖产量由往年的３亿块下降到５０００万块。同时，钢材、木材等主要建筑原材料也都偏紧。
    面临重重困难，哈市争取主动采取对策，努力在困境中求生存，紧缩中求发展。
    ——全面整顿，逐步建立建筑市场新秩序。为了控制建筑队伍盲目发展，哈市从今年起不再审批新组建的建筑队伍。同时调整建筑施工队伍结构，着重充实力工、装修、抹灰等短缺工种。进一步稳定建筑市场价格，定期公布材料价格指数，对短缺材料实行最高限价，实行劳务市场工资限价。同时，实行公开招标，凡投资在１００万元以上，建筑面积３０００平方米以上的工程，择优选定施工单位。制止建筑市场违法乱纪行为，对政府工作人员在公司兼职的，限期在今年第一季度辞去一方职务。对利用发包权泄露标底，索取回扣的建筑单位，追究领导者和当事人的经济、行政、法律责任。
    ——深化改革，推进以“股份制”为主的企业经营机制改革，积极引进风险机制。同时，以开辟第三产业为主，扩大多种经营，面向乡镇承揽施工任务，允许多余人员走向社会，自谋出路。
    ——强化宏观控制，创造良好的建筑环境。坚持实行统一规划、统一开发和统一建筑，改变全市目前分散征地，资金流失状况。
