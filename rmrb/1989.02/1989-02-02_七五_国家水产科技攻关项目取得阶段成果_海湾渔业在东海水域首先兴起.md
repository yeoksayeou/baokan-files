One of the key projects in China's "Seventh Five-Year Plan" for aquaculture science and technology—sea bay aquaculture development technology—has achieved remarkable results in the East China Sea, particularly in the breeding of Chinese white shrimp.

Since 1986, China's aquaculture science and technology departments have utilized the semi-enclosed natural characteristics and abundant feed organisms in sea bays to conduct environmental and harmful organism surveys in three sea bays. After research, large-scale artificial release and breeding trials of Chinese white shrimp were conducted, releasing a total of 1.19 billion shrimp seedlings.

Over three years of trials, the number of Chinese white shrimp in the release areas has significantly increased. A total of 1,948 tons of released shrimp have been recaptured, with an input-output ratio exceeding 1:5, achieving significant social and economic benefits. Notably, in July 1988, two distinct groups of Chinese white shrimp were discovered during the recapture of released shrimp in the East China Sea trial waters. This indicates the potential for forming new natural populations of Chinese white shrimp in the East China Sea. In the southern sea bays of the East China Sea, the proportion of bred Chinese white shrimp to various local shrimp species increased from about 1/3 in 1987 to approximately 1/2 in 1988. In the spring of 1988, more than 240,000 breeding-sized shrimp, approximately 20 centimeters in length, were recaptured near the trial waters, providing a large number of high-quality broodstock for local shrimp aquaculture.

Fishermen near the trial sea bays have requested to continue expanding the scale of artificial release and breeding of shrimp. Currently, China has several more sea bays conducting artificial release and breeding trials of Chinese white shrimp.

Meanwhile, aquaculture researchers have also conducted breeding and release trials of various locally characteristic aquatic species, such as jellyfish, large yellow croaker, mud clams, Pacific oysters, Venus clams, blue crabs, flatfish, and yellowfin tuna, achieving varying degrees of progress.

China has a long and winding coastline with numerous sea bays, totaling more than 20 major bays. Sea bay waters not only have good enclosure, abundant feed, but also stable sea surfaces and relatively stable physicochemical environmental factors, making them ideal locations for aquaculture and breeding.

　　“七五”国家水产科技攻关项目取得阶段成果
    海湾渔业在东海水域首先兴起
    本报讯  我国“七五”期间的水产科技攻关项目之一——海湾水产开发技术，在东海水域增殖中国对虾取得令人瞩目的成效。
    １９８６年以来，我国水产科技部门利用海湾半封闭的自然特点和丰富的饵料生物，在三个海湾开展了海湾环境和敌害生物调查。经过研究，进行了大规模的中国对虾人工放流增殖试验，共放流中国对虾苗１１．９亿尾。
    试验三年，放流海域中国对虾数量明显增多，已回捕放流对虾１９４８吨，投入产出比高于１∶５，获得了重大的社会和经济效益。特别是１９８８年７月在东海试验水域回捕放流对虾生产中，发现了两个个体差异明显的中国对虾群体。这一情况表明，可望在我国东海水域形成新的中国对虾自然群体。在东海南部海湾的试验，根据１９８８年调查测算，增殖的中国对虾与当地多种虾类的比重已由１９８７年约占１／３，提高到１／２左右。１９８８年春季在两个试验附近水域，还回捕到虾长约２０厘米的产卵回归亲虾２４万多尾，为当地对虾养殖业提供了大量用于人工育苗的优质亲虾。
    在试验海湾附近的渔民纷纷要求继续扩大人工放流增殖对虾规模。现在，我国又有一些海湾相继开展了中国对虾人工放流增殖试验。
    与此同时，水产科研人员还结合各地有特色的水产品种，开展了海蜇、大黄鱼、泥蚶、太平洋牡蛎、寻氏肌蛤、青蟹、牙鲆和黄盖鲽等的养殖、增殖试验，也取得了不同程度的进展。
    我国海岸线曲折，海湾众多，仅主要海湾就有２０多个。海湾水域不仅封闭性好，饵料丰富，而且海面平稳，理化环境因子比较稳定，是开展水产养殖、增殖的理想场所。
