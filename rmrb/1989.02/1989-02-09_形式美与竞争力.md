Contemporary industrial design, known domestically as technical aesthetics, industrial art, or product design, is an interdisciplinary field that emerged with the rise of modern industry. It first appeared in Britain and developed in Germany in the early 20th century. After World War II, it became popular in Europe, America, Japan, and the Soviet Union. In China, it is a new and emerging discipline.

Industrial design is comprehensive. Its core is product design, which involves integrating factors such as functionality, materials, structure, shape, color, and surface decoration from social, economic, technical, and aesthetic perspectives. It is closely related to people's daily lives—from clothing, food, housing, and transportation to large items like cars, trains, airplanes, and ocean liners, and small items like buttons, hairpins, bowls, and spoons.

One reason industrial design has gained attention in contemporary times is that as people's lives improve, their aesthetic standards are also rising. "Only when one is well-fed can one seek beauty; only when one is well-clothed can one seek elegance." Industrial design, which serves people's lives, must not only fulfill its functional purposes but also make the product's appearance an important factor in design.

China is in the primary stage of socialism, characterized by a commodity economy. To make products competitive in the market, open up sales channels, promote circulation, and gain profits, it is crucial to focus on product quality and functionality. In addition, the aesthetic appeal of the product's exterior, including shape and color, is also very important. When quality, functionality, and price are similar, a product's aesthetic design can become a decisive factor in competition. In this sense, industrial design has competitiveness.

The international market is an even broader and more intense competitive arena. Product design must have its own unique character, image, national characteristics, and sense of the times to be competitive. Industrial design rapidly developed in the 1940s abroad because, after World War II, European countries, due to war destruction and economic crises, had to find new outlets for their industrial products. They began to innovate product design, applying aesthetics to industrial production to open up markets and escape crises. Post-war Japan's recovery also relied on economic development. Japan's economic takeoff was achieved through industrial art design, which helped it escape economic crises and open up and expand international markets. In Japan, all business owners place product design at the top of their priorities. They demand that designers not only focus on shape and decorative beauty but also on reducing costs, lowering product prices, and conserving energy to design various new products that keep pace with contemporary life and are welcomed by the international market. Consequently, many products such as home appliances, audio-visual equipment, watches, cameras, and automobiles and motorcycles have captured the world market.

Industrial design is not just about artistic form and beauty; it is also a comprehensive carrier of information about economic structure, social existence, and ideological forms. A product is a summation of the economic base, social structure, and ideological forms of its era and nation, containing information from natural sciences (including materials, structure, technological level, and processing techniques) and social sciences (including people's living standards, lifestyles, and aesthetic concepts). These integrated pieces of information are displayed through the product, reflecting a country's economic development level and changes in people's ideas.

Industrial design in China is still in its infancy. Since the introduction of design aesthetics, significant achievements have been made, but it has not yet received high attention from some production sectors. For example, some well-known light industrial products from Shanghai, such as the Butterfly brand and Flying Man brand sewing machines, have reliable quality. However, due to outdated designs, their shapes have remained unchanged for years, even decades. Therefore, they cannot enter the supermarkets of developed countries and can only be sold to developing countries with weaker industrial bases, causing these high-quality products to lose their international competitiveness. This is a signal worth noting. Let us pay attention to industrial design and let our products showcase the new look of the Chinese nation to the world!

### 形式美与竞争力

　　形式美与竞争力
　　陆家桂
    当代流行的工业设计，在国内又被称为技术美学、工业美术、造型设计或产品设计等。它是一门随着现代工业的兴起而产生的边缘学科，最早萌芽于英国，二十世纪初在德国得到发展，二次世界大战后，盛行于欧、美、日本、苏联等国家。在中国是一门新兴的学科。
    工业设计具有综合性。它的核心是产品设计，即对产品的功能、材料、结构、造型、色彩和表面装饰等多种因素，从社会的、经济的、技术的、美学的角度作出综合处理。它和人们的日常生活——衣、食、住、行息息相关，大至汽车、火车、飞机、万吨巨轮、宇航舱座；小至纽扣、发夹、饭碗、羹匙等都属于它的范畴。
    工业设计所以在当代受到关注，其原因之一，是人们随着生活的改善，审美水平在不断提高。“食必常饱，然后求美；衣必常暖，然后求丽”。服务于人民生活的工业设计，在实现使用功能的同时，产品的美观就成了设计中的一个重要因素。
    中国处于社会主义的初级阶段，其经济特征是推行商品经济。要使产品在竞争中占领市场，打开销路，促进流通，赢得利润，除重视产品质量和使用功能外，产品外形的美观，包括造型美和色彩、装饰美，也是十分重要的。在质量、使用价值、销售价格相同或相似的情况下，外形美的设计就会成为竞争中获取胜利的重要手段。就这一意义上说，工业设计具有竞争性。
    国际市场是一个更为广泛、更为激烈的竞争场所。产品外观的设计一定要有自己的个性、形象，有自己的民族特色和时代感，才有竞争力。工业设计于40年代在国外得到迅速发展，是因为，第二次世界大战后，欧洲各国由于战争破坏和经济危机，迫使工业产品寻找新的出路，于是他们从革新产品设计着手，把美学运用于工业生产，为产品开拓市场，解脱厄运。战后的日本能从战败中站起来，也是依赖于发展经济。而日本经济的起飞，更是通过工业美术设计开路，从经济危机中解脱出来，开拓并扩大国际市场。在日本，所有企业主都把产品设计问题放到头等重要的位置，他们要求设计者不仅在造型、装饰美方面，也要从降低成本、降低产品价格以及节约能源等方面，设计出各种新产品，使之和当代生活同步，并受到国际市场的欢迎，因而不少产品如家电、影视设备、钟表、摄影器以及汽车、摩托车等产品占领了世界市场。
    工业设计不仅是艺术形式美的问题，它还是经济结构、社会存在、观念形态等信息的综合载体。一件产品无不是那个时代、那个良族的经济基础、社会结构、观念形态的总和，既有自然科学的信息（包括材料、结构、科技水平、加工工艺水平等因素），也有社会科学的记录（包括人们的生活水平、生活方式、审美观念等）。这些被综合了的信息经由产品展示了一个国家的经济发展水平和人们观念的变化。
    工业设计在中国尚属年轻，自开展设计美学以来已取得了很大成果，但还没有引起某些生产部门的高度重视。如上海部分名牌轻工产品蝴蝶牌、飞人牌缝纫机等，它们的质量无疑是可靠的，但由于设计陈旧，几年乃至几十年来其造型仍是“老面孔”，因此，进不了发达国家的超级市场，只能销往工业基础较薄弱的发展中国家，使这些优质产品失去了国际竞争力量，这是一个值得注意的信号。让我们重视工业设计，让我们的产品展示中华民族的崭新风貌于世界吧！
