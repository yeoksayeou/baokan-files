During a visit to Hainan Province, reporters frequently encountered vast tracts of abandoned farmland, many of which were "roadside fields" and "village entrance fields." The scene was one of "fields overgrown with weeds." Upon checking with the provincial agricultural department, it was found that the actual situation was even more severe than imagined. In 1986, Hainan's grain planting area was 7.75 million mu, producing 13.8 million tons of grain; in 1987, the planting area was 7.64 million mu, producing 13.3 million tons of grain; in 1988, the planting area was 7.4 million mu, producing 12.2 million tons of grain.

According to officials, the reduction in grain planting area due to adjustments in planting structure was minimal. Therefore, in 1988, compared to 1986, the actual abandoned farmland amounted to 300,000 mu, which is about 1/20 of the province's total grain planting area. As a result, grain production decreased by 1.6 million tons. This is not the most shocking part. Historical records show that since liberation, Hainan's largest grain planting area and highest grain production were both in 1975, with figures of 10.35 million mu and 20.3 million tons, respectively. How many people consume grain? In 1975, Hainan had 4.97 million people, and in 1988, it had 6.07 million people. The grain yield per mu was 197 kilograms in 1975 and 165 kilograms in 1988 (of course, the decrease in grain yield per unit area is related to natural conditions). Hainan has limited arable land, and the shortage of grain is evident.

Officials from the agricultural department said that since 1984, efforts have been made to address the issue of abandoned farmland, but the problem persists year after year with no significant progress.

Last year, the newly established Communist Party of China Hainan Provincial Committee and the Hainan Provincial People's Government decided to tackle the issue of abandoned farmland in rural areas. This year, they tasked each county with formulating specific measures to stop the abandonment of farmland and to develop and reclaim abandoned fields. Counties such as Wenchang and Qionghai adopted the "encouragement, preferential treatment, restriction, and contract transfer" approach: for every mu of abandoned land reclaimed, 25 kilograms of fertilizer and 1.5 kilograms of diesel are awarded. The mandatory grain procurement is waived for three years. Those who abandon their land are still required to fulfill the mandatory grain procurement and collective levies. Those who abandon farming to engage in business without proper contract transfer procedures will have their business licenses revoked. These measures have had some effect. Wenchang County reclaimed 110,000 mu from 330,000 mu of abandoned land. From a provincial perspective, nearly 700,000 mu of abandoned land have been reclaimed this year, with about 500,000 mu already planted with grain. At the same time, the entire province has seen a surge in early-season fertilizer accumulation and application, with 50 million tons of fertilizer already accumulated, doubling last year's amount.

　　海南治弃耕
    本报记者  罗自苏
    记者在海南省采访，经常看到大片农田被弃，其中不少还是“路边田”、“村口田”，那情景可谓“田荒草自新”。到省农业厅一查资料，发现实际情况比想象的严重得多。１９８６年海南粮食播种面积７７５万亩，产粮１３８万吨；１９８７年播种面积７６４万亩，产粮１３３万吨；１９８８年播种面积７４０万亩，产粮１２２万吨。
    据主管人员介绍，其中因种植结构调整而减少的种粮面积为数很少，因此１９８８年比１９８６年实际丢荒达３０万亩，几占全省粮食播种面积的１／２０。由此，粮食减产１６万吨。这还不算惊人。记者查询历史资料得知，海南自解放以来粮食播种面积最大，粮食总产量最高的是１９７５年，其数据分别为１０３５万亩和２０３万吨。那么吃粮的人有多少呢？１９７５年海南人有４９７万人，１９８８年有６０７万人，粮食亩产１９７５年为１９７公斤，１９８８年是１６５公斤（当然，粮食单产的减少跟自然条件有关系）。海南省农田不多，粮食缺乏的情况一目了然。
    农业部门的同志说，１９８４年起就开始整治丢荒问题，但年年抓，年年丢，几年内没有成效。
    去年，新成立的中共海南省委、省人民政府下决心整治农村的丢荒问题。今年又责成各县制定制止弃耕丢荒、开发复耕荒田的具体措施。文昌、琼海等县采取了“鼓励、优惠、限制、转包”的办法：每开一亩荒田奖励２５公斤化肥、１．５公斤柴油。减免三年公购粮。凡弃不种者，公购粮和集体提留照交。弃农经商如不办好转包手续的，坚决收回其营业执照等等。这些措施收到了一定的效果，文昌县从３．３万亩荒田中一下吃回１．１万亩，从全省来看今年已复耕近７万亩荒田，其中已有约５万亩种下粮食。同时，全省早造积肥、送肥下田已成热潮，全省早造积肥已５０００万担，比去年翻了一番。
