Sima Yi Aimatiji, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and Minister of the State Ethnic Affairs Commission, strongly criticized the splittist forces in exile yesterday at the national meeting of the heads of ethnic affairs commissions. He proposed to continuously enhance the cohesion of all ethnic groups in China and promote the continuous consolidation and development of socialist ethnic relations in China to new breadth and depth.

Sima Yi Aimatiji said that with the easing of international relations and the improvement of relations with neighboring countries, the splittist forces in exile are shifting their focus of sabotage to the domestic arena, using the banners of ethnicity and religion to incite trouble. With the deepening of reform and opening up, the imbalance in development between regions and ethnic groups will continue to widen in a certain period. With the development of democratic politics, the democratic consciousness of the people of all ethnic groups has been enhanced, and they sometimes strongly react to certain phenomena in actual life that violate the principle of equality.

He said that all these factors may affect ethnic relations and even lead to some conflicts and friction. Therefore, in the new year, all levels of ethnic affairs commissions must seriously investigate and study the new situations and problems that have emerged in ethnic relations, explore, study, and propose correct solutions and measures, assist relevant departments and localities, and strive to eliminate all destabilizing factors.

He emphasized that the struggle against domestic and foreign splittist elements is a long-term struggle that concerns the fundamental interests of all ethnic groups in the country. On this major principle issue, one must always be clear-cut and firm. All ethnic groups must unite and resolutely smash all splittist activities.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 21 (reporter Sun Yong), Zhao Yianian, Vice Minister of the State Ethnic Affairs Commission, said at the national meeting of the heads of ethnic affairs commissions that in the reform of the investment system in ethnic minority areas, it is necessary to combine selective investment with the policy of supporting ethnic minority areas.

Zhao Yianian believes that in the investment reform in ethnic minority areas, it is also necessary to plan and select and cultivate new bases or production points and supporting points that can drive the development of the surrounding areas. For example: accelerate the construction of the Northern Railway, and build another Eurasian Continental Bridge as soon as possible; develop the "Upper Yellow River Multi-Ethnic Economic Development Zone," and strengthen the planning and planning work of comprehensive development and utilization of water resources, navigation, and mineral resources such as the Red Water River, Wujiang, and Lancangjiang, etc.

　　司马义·艾买提在民委主任会上讲话
    抨击民族分裂势力 
    赵延年说对民族地区择优投资
    本报北京２月２１日讯  记者袁建达报道：全国政协副主席、国家民委主任司马义·艾买提昨天在全国民委主任会议上猛烈抨击流亡国外的分裂势力，提出要不断增强中华各民族的凝聚力，促进我国的社会主义民族关系不断巩固并向新的广度和深度发展。
    司马义·艾买提说，随着国际关系走向缓和以及同邻国关系的改善，流亡国外的分裂势力正把破坏重点转向国内，打着民族和宗教的旗号煽动闹事；随着改革开放的深入，在一定时期内地区和民族之间的发展不平衡继续扩大；随着民主政治的发展，各民族人民的民主意识增强了，对实际生活中的某些违背平等原则的现象有时会表现强烈的反映。
    他说，所有这一切都有可能影响民族关系，甚至出现一些冲突和磨擦。因此，在新的一年里，各级民委都要认真调查和研究民族关系方面所出现的新情况、新问题，探讨、研究和提出正确解决的办法及措施，协助有关部门和地方，努力消除各种不安定因素。
    他强调指出，反对国内外分裂主义分子的斗争，是关系到全国各族人民根本利益的长期斗争。在这个重大原则问题上，任何时候都必须旗帜鲜明，立场坚定。各族人民要团结一致，坚决粉碎一切分裂活动。
    据新华社北京２月２１日电　（记者孙勇）国家民委副主任赵延年在全国民委主任会议上说，在民族地区的投资体制改革中，要把择优投放同坚持对民族地区进行扶持的政策结合起来。
    赵延年认为，在民族地区的投资改革中还应有计划地选择和培育能带动周围发展的新的基地或生产点、支撑点。比如：加快北疆铁路的建设，尽快建成另一座欧亚大陆桥；兴办“黄河上游多民族经济开发区”，加强对红水河、乌江、澜沧江等水能、航运和矿产资源综合开发利用的论证和规划工作等等。
