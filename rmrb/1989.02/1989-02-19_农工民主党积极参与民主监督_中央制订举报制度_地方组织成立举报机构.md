The China Agricultural and Democratic Party has taken another significant step in participating in political consultation and democratic supervision.

A responsible person from the Central Organization Department of the China Agricultural and Democratic Party revealed today at the Beijing Press Club that the party's central organization has drafted regulations for establishing a reporting system and plans to formally establish a reporting agency soon.

The deployment by the Central Organization of the China Agricultural and Democratic Party is in response to a suggestion from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. On November 9 last year, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, in a congratulatory message on the convening of the 10th National Congress of the China Agricultural and Democratic Party, suggested that all democratic parties establish a reporting system to supervise and inspect certain corrupt practices in the Communist Party and government agencies. The draft regulations specify the scope of reporting, reporting methods, the composition of the reporting agency, and other details, and also propose to effectively protect the reporters.

It is understood that the Dalian Municipal Committee of the China Agricultural and Democratic Party formally established a reporting office at the end of last year, which is the first reporting agency established by a democratic party. The various democratic parties in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region have also dispatched personnel to serve as special supervisory inspectors in government supervisory agencies. The establishment of reporting agencies by democratic parties will make a positive contribution to improving the economic environment and rectifying economic order.

　　农工民主党积极参与民主监督    
    中央制订举报制度　地方组织成立举报机构
    本报北京２月１８日讯  记者袁建达报道：中国农工民主党在参政议政、民主监督方面又迈出了可喜的一步。
    农工党中央组织部的一位负责人今天在首都新闻记者联谊会上透露，农工党中央已经制订了关于建立举报制度的规定（稿），预计不久就要正式成立举报机构。
    农工党中央的这一部署，是为响应中共中央的建议而采取的。中共中央去年１１月９日在祝贺农工党十大召开时建议各民主党派建立举报制度，对中共和政府机关的某些腐败现象进行监督和检查。这个规定（稿）规定了举报范围、举报办法、举报机构的组成及其它细则，还提出要切实保护举报人。
    据悉，农工党大连市委已于去年年底正式成立了举报办公室，这是民主党派成立的首家举报机构。广西壮族自治区各民主党派也分别选派人员到政府监察机关任特约监察员。民主党派成立举报机构，将对治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序作出积极的贡献。
