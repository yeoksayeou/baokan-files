Winning the first match is the top priority for the Chinese team. We have fully prepared for the difficulties of this match. We were also mentally prepared for the team's cautious performance and inability to fully utilize their skills in the first half. Therefore, from an overall tactical perspective, the Chinese team played relatively normally in the first half and during the period before scoring in the second half. However, after scoring two goals, the team's performance became somewhat lax, which was not satisfactory. This match also shows that the Bangladesh national team is not a weak team. Their positioning, movement, and even their defense are better than the Chinese team. When defending, the Bangladesh team's quick footwork and aggressive actions limited the Chinese team's scoring opportunities.

　　进球后表现松散不尽如意
    ——中国队教练高丰文评球
    高丰文：初战取胜对于中国队来说是第一位的。对这场比赛的困难我们已作充分准备，对上半时全队表现拘谨、不能充分发挥技术也有思想准备。因而，从整体打法上说，中国队上半时及下半时进球前的那段时间都踢得较为正常。反而射入两球后打法有些松散，不能令人满意。这场比赛也可以说明，孟加拉国队并不是一支很弱的队伍，他们的跑位、移动甚至比中国队还要好。防守时孟队出脚快、动作猛，使中国队得到的射门良机并不多。　陈士军
