There are many restaurants along the Shijiazhuang to Ping Shan stone ridge road. Within just five or six kilometers from Baichizhan to Mengling, there are 70 of them. Normally, having many restaurants should make it convenient to eat, but if you ask around, the response is almost always: "No food left." Those who know the situation say that these restaurants hardly sell any real food, yet they make money more easily than genuine restaurants. The reason is that this road leads directly to the coal mines of Shanxi, and coal-carrying vehicles pass through constantly. As long as the restaurant owners give the drivers a little bribe, the drivers will generously unload a ton or two of coal. Coal that sells for 70 to 80 yuan per ton on the market, after unloading a ton, the owner gives the driver about 50 yuan, or a bottle of good liquor, a pack of good cigarettes, and then sells the coal, the owner can make a net profit of 20 to 30 yuan per ton. With such an easy way to make money, why bother with the trouble of cooking and selling food?

One restaurant owner said that each restaurant has a relatively fixed relationship with the drivers. Many restaurants even hire female waitresses specifically to cultivate relationships with the drivers.

　　治一治“吃公路”的饭馆
    新华社记者  景如月
    石家庄到平山的石岗公路上饭馆可真多，从百尺竿到孟岭不过五六公里的路段，就有７０个。按说，饭馆多了，吃饭准方便，可你挨个儿问问，回答几乎都是：“没饭了”。明“戏”的人告诉说，这儿的馆子几乎没有正儿八经卖饭菜的，可赚钱比真开饭馆的又容易得多。原来这条公路直通山西煤炭产地，运炭的车辆过往不断，只要饭馆老板给司机点好处，司机们便慷慨卸下吨把煤。市场价七八十元一吨的煤，卸一吨，老板塞给司机５０元左右，或是一瓶好酒、一条好烟，转手就把煤倒出去，老板每吨便可净挣二三十元。有这样便当的生财之道，干嘛还要不嫌麻烦的炒菜做饭卖呢？
    一位老板说，每个饭馆都有比较固定的关系司机。不少饭馆还雇了女服务员，专门负责笼络司机。
