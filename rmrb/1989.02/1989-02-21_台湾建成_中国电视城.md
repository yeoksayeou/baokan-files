Taiwan Completes "Chinese Television City"

Taiwan's China Television Company (CTV) has completed the construction of the "Chinese Television City" at a cost of 70 million Taiwan dollars. The city officially opened to visitors on February 2.

Inside the television city, the latest television technology is on display. Additionally, various props used by the television station are exhibited, allowing visitors to operate them personally and take photographs for souvenirs. Activities include sitting at the news anchor desk to deliver news, dressing up as an emperor to pose with a wax figure of Empress Wu Zetian, or holding a "thousand-pound cauldron" prop to act like a strongman. These experiences indeed offer a unique charm.

　　台湾建成“中国电视城”
    由台湾中视公司耗资７０００万台币兴建的中国电视城，２月２日正式接待游人参观。
    电视城内除了展示最新的电视科技外，还陈设了多项电视台内的道具，可供游人亲身操作，并拍照留念。诸如坐上新闻播音台，充当播音员报新闻，化妆成皇帝，与武则天蜡像合影，或举着“千斤鼎”道具，权充大力士等，还真别有一番情趣。
