The Central Party Building Research Class Discusses Current Tasks in the Party's Ideological and Theoretical Construction

Clarifying Ambiguous Perceptions, Boosting Morale, and Enhancing Cohesion

Arming the Entire Party with the Theory and Line of Socialism with Chinese Characteristics

Beijing, February 2 (Xinhua) - New China News Agency reporter Sun Benyao, People's Daily reporter Yin Pinduan report: The Central Party Building Research Class, which concluded today in Beijing, emphasized in its discussions that in the primary stage of socialism, efforts must be made to build the Party into a strong core leading the people to build socialism with Chinese characteristics. Currently, the theoretical principles and basic line established and expounded by the Thirteenth National Congress should be used to further unify the Party's thinking, boost morale, enhance confidence, adhere to strict Party governance, and ensure the smooth progress of economic environment rectification, economic order rectification, and comprehensive reform.

The Party Building Research Class, organized by the Central Committee, began on January 4 at the Central Party School. During the discussions, General Secretary Zhao Ziyang of the CPC Central Committee had three separate conversations with some of the participants and held two group discussions with all the participants, also delivering a speech on Party building. Comrade Qiao Shi, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and head of the Central Party Building Work Group, spoke at the opening meeting of the research class and at today's concluding discussion meeting. Comrade Song Pian, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Minister of the Organization Department, participated in the discussions several times.

Guided by the central leadership's thinking on Party building since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee and the policy of strict Party governance, the research class focused on the theme of strengthening and improving Party leadership in a historic transformation period, leveraging political advantages, and better fulfilling the historical mission of leading the people to build socialism with Chinese characteristics. The class conducted in-depth studies on several major issues in current Party building. The entire discussion process emphasized the integration of theory and practice, open expression of views, mutual learning, and communication, resulting in significant benefits.

The research class analyzed the current state of the Party from a developmental and dynamic perspective and concluded that the past decade of reform has proven that the Party's line is correct, the vast majority of Party members are working hard for the people, and the Party's organization is generally vibrant and full of vitality, capable of leading socialist modernization. This is the essence and mainstream, which should be fully affirmed with confidence. At the same time, it must be acknowledged that there are indeed some corrupt and lax phenomena within the Party, some of which are quite serious, and must be given high attention. Strict Party governance must be adhered to, and negative phenomena must be minimized. In assessing the current state of the Party, it is wrong and harmful to either paint the Party as entirely black or to be complacent about the urgent problems within the Party that need to be solved.

In analyzing the current state of the Party's ideological and theoretical construction, the research class believed that the most important task at present is to arm the entire Party with the theory and line of socialism with Chinese characteristics, clarify ambiguous perceptions, boost morale, and enhance cohesion within the Party. The Party's ideological and theoretical construction and theoretical research on Party building must always pay attention to adapting to new situations, analyzing new circumstances, and answering new questions.

The research class discussed the issue of strengthening and improving Party leadership in the context of separating Party and government functions, unanimously agreeing that the separation of Party and government refers to specific work systems and does not change the Party's ruling position and political leadership role.

The research class also conducted in-depth discussions and studies on implementing the policy of strict Party governance, strengthening the construction of leading cadres at all levels, the Party governing the Party, and maintaining integrity.

The participants in this research class mainly included leading comrades from some provincial, autonomous region, and municipal Party committees, as well as two veteran comrades, four leading comrades from relevant central departments, five municipal and prefecture-level Party secretaries, and two comrades engaged in Party building theory work, totaling 30 people.

Comrade Song Pian, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Minister of the Organization Department, spoke at today's discussion meeting.

　　中央党建研究班谈当前党的思想理论建设任务
    澄清模糊认识　振奋精神　增强凝聚力
    以建设有中国特色的社会主义理论和路线武装全党
    本报北京２月２日讯  新华社记者孙本尧、本报记者尹品端报道：今天在北京结束的中央党的建设研究班在研讨中强调，在社会主义初级阶段，要努力把党建设成为领导人民建设有中国特色的社会主义的坚强核心。当前要用十三大确立和阐明的理论和基本路线进一步统一全党思想，振奋精神，增强信心，坚持从严治党，保证治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序和全面深化改革的顺利进行。
    由党中央举办的党的建设研究班于１月４日在中央党校开班。研讨期间，中共中央总书记赵紫阳分别同参加研究班的部分同志交谈了三次，同全体同志座谈了两次，并就党的建设问题讲了话。中共中央政治局常委、中央党的建设工作小组组长乔石在研究班开班会议和今天举行的研究班结束座谈会上讲了话。中共中央政治局委员、中组部部长宋平多次参加了研讨。
    这个研究班以党的十一届三中全会以来中央关于党的建设的指导思想和从严治党的方针为指南，围绕在历史性大转变时期加强和改善党的领导，发挥政治优势，使党更好地担负起领导人民建设有中国特色的社会主义的历史重任这个主题，对当前党的建设中一些重大问题认真进行了研究。整个研讨活动坚持理论联系实际，各抒己见，互相切磋，通过研讨，上下沟通，彼此交流，很有收益。
    研究班用发展的、动态的观点分析了党的现状后认为，１０年改革的事实证明，党的路线是正确的，绝大多数党员是努力为人民工作的，党的组织从总体上看是富有生机活力的，有能力领导社会主义现代化建设。这是本质和主流，应当理直气壮地充分肯定。同时也必须看到，党内确实存在着某些腐败和涣散现象，有的还比较严重，必须予以高度重视，坚持从严治党，把消极现象减少到最低限度。在对党的现状的估计上，把党说得一团漆黑，或对党内存在的亟待解决的问题掉以轻心，都是错误的和有害的。
    在分析党的思想理论建设状况时，研究班认为，当前最重要的是，用建设有中国特色的社会主义的理论和路线武装全党，澄清模糊认识，振奋精神，增强党内的凝聚力。党的思想理论建设和党的建设的理论研究，都必须经常注意适应新形势，分析新情况，回答新问题。
    研究班讨论了在党政分开的情况下加强和改善党的领导问题，一致认为，党政分开是指具体的工作体制，决不是要改变党的执政地位和政治领导作用。
    研究班的同志还对落实从严治党方针、加强各级领导班子建设、党要管党、保持廉洁等问题进行了探讨和研究。
    参加这次研究班的，主要是一些省、自治区、直辖市党委的领导同志，还有两位老同志、四位中央有关部门的领导同志、５位市地委书记和两位从事党建理论工作的同志，共３０人。
    中共中央政治局委员、中组部部长宋平在今天的座谈会上讲了话。
