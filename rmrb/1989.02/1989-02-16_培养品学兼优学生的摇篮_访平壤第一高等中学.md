On the picturesque banks of the Taedong River, a 10-story building with blue and white colors stands out prominently. This is the model school of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Pyongyang First Senior Middle School, established in 1984.

So far, 80% of the graduating students each year are "excellent" students, earning it the reputation as the "cradle of cultivating students with both morality and academic excellence."

In the spacious, bright, and clean principal's office, Principal Chae Jae-in, who has been awarded the title of "People's Teacher," and Vice Principal Shin Su-hong, who is a "Meritorious Teacher," introduced to the reporter that the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, led by Kim Jong-il, the member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee and Secretary, attaches great importance to secondary education to cultivate the next generation into revolutionary successors with comprehensive development of intelligence, morality, and physique. This is because adolescents are in the period of forming their worldview. Although the school recruits students from all over the country, and the students admitted are the best from various places, the intelligence and interests of more than 1,700 students are different. To strengthen ideological and moral education for students, the school, in addition to focusing on political theory education, adopts the method of combining self-education with collective help, fully playing the role of the Young Pioneer Corps and the Socialist Working Youth League. Primary school students participate in the activities of the Socialist Working Youth League. These two organizations hold a life meeting every Saturday, where students summarize, check, and evaluate their thoughts and studies for the week, and carry out mutual help and learning. The school also often organizes students to visit the Revolutionary Museum to receive revolutionary tradition education. During holidays, students are organized to visit revolutionary sites far from Pyongyang, allowing students to step out of the school gates, go to the vast countryside to broaden their horizons, cultivate their spirit of hard work and perseverance, and make them feel the beauty of nature and strengthen their love for their motherland. Principal Chae Jae-in said that in this way, students' collective consciousness is cultivated, their ability to think independently is enhanced, and the mutual trust between teachers and students is strengthened.

This school attaches great importance to foreign language education. Principal Chae Jae-in said that there are many favorable conditions for foreign language education during the middle school period. Students have strong language sensitivity, quick memory and response, and are not easily forgotten. To help students learn foreign languages well, the school is equipped with 35 video machines and 50 televisions for students to use during their studies. Currently, the foreign language courses offered include Chinese, English, Russian, Japanese, and Spanish. It is reported that there are 450 students learning Chinese. According to the teaching plan, all graduates must be proficient in one foreign language, and their oral and written translation skills must reach an intermediate level.

To teach students well, a team of teachers with good quality is indispensable. To improve the quality of teachers, they mainly rely on self-cultivation and self-improvement.

The school requires teachers to summarize their teaching quality every week and regularly evaluate teachers. Although each teacher teaches 6 classes a day, the school still supports young teachers to find time to attend professional correspondence courses. Due to these measures, the construction of the teaching team has achieved remarkable results. Currently, among the more than 120 teachers in the school, there are 12 "People's Teachers," 2 "Meritorious Teachers," 2 senior teachers, and 3 teachers who have obtained doctoral and associate doctoral degrees. Last year, 9 teachers were rated as model teachers.

To ensure the physical health of students, the school has built an indoor swimming pool and a gymnasium, and often holds sports meetings and single-item sports competitions. The school also built 3 canteens and a collective dormitory with 400 beds for students from other places. For students who have one meal in the canteen at noon, the state also provides appropriate subsidies.

　　培养品学兼优学生的摇篮   
    ——访平壤第一高等中学
    新华社记者  黎能清
    在风景优美的普通江畔，一幢蓝白相间的１０层大楼格外引人注目。这就是１９８４年创办的朝鲜样板学校——平壤第一高等中学。
    迄今为止，每年应届毕业生的８０％都是“最优等”生，因而被誉为“培养品学兼优学生的摇篮”。
    在宽敞、明亮、整洁的校长办公室里，被授予“人民教师”称号的裴在仁校长和“功勋教师”申寿雄副校长向记者介绍说，朝鲜劳动党中央政治局常委、书记金正日同志为了把下一代培养成为智德体全面发展的革命接班人，特别重视中等教育。因为这是青少年处于确立世界观的成熟时期。尽管学校面向全国招生，考进来的是各地的尖子，但１７００多名中小学生的智力、兴趣都各有差异。为了加强对学生的思想道德教育，学校除抓好政治理论教育，还采用自我教育与集体帮助相结合的方法，充分发挥少年团和社会主义劳动青年同盟的作用。小学生参加社会主义劳动青年同盟的活动。这两个组织每星期六过一次生活会，学生们对一周来的思想、学习进行总结、检查和评议，开展互帮互学。学校还经常组织学生去革命博物馆接受革命传统教育。每逢假期，则组织学生到远离平壤的革命史迹地参观，让学生们走出校门，到广阔的农村去开阔眼界，以培养他们吃苦耐劳的精神，使他们感受大自然的美，增强对自己祖国的热爱之情。裴在仁校长说，这样做，培养了学生的集体观念，提高了学生独立思考的能力，增强了师生间的相互信任感。
    这所学校很重视外语教育。裴在仁校长说，中学时期抓外语教育有利条件很多，学生的语感强，记忆和反应迅速，不易忘记，为帮助学生们学好外语，学校里配有３５台录像机和５０台电视机供学生学习时使用。目前，开设的外语课有汉语、英语、俄语、日语和西班牙语。据介绍，选学汉语的学生有４５０名。按教学计划的要求，所有毕业生都必须会一门外语，口笔译达到中等水平。
    要教好学生，没有一批素质好的教师队伍是不行的。为了提高教师的素质，他们主要是靠自己培养，自我提高。
    学校规定教师每周对自己的教学质量进行总结，并且定期对教师进行评议等。尽管每位教师一天要教６节课，但学校仍支持年轻教师挤出时间参加专业函授课。由于采取了这些措施，教师队伍建设成绩显著。目前，在全校的１２０多名教师中，有“人民教师”１２名，“功勋教师”２名，特级教师２名，还有３名教师取得了博士、副博士学位。去年又有９名教师被评为模范教师。
    为了保证学生的身体健康，学校修建了室内游泳馆、体育馆，经常举办运动会和单项体育比赛。学校还建了３个食堂，有４００个床位的集体宿舍供外地学生使用。对中午在食堂就一顿餐的学生，国家还给予适当的补贴。
