He loves green, loves it to the point of obsession.

Green loves him, his life is prolonged in the green.

Nine years ago, an accident left him disabled. His legs began to atrophy, he lost control of his bladder and bowels, and he could no longer stand...

When he was at his most desperate, a song called "Please Leave a Shade" that he happened to hear on the radio gave him the courage to live again. "That's right, I can't live like this in despair. I have to fight, to survive through struggle." He gazed at the barren hills by the village, and in his mind, he saw a lush green landscape; he wanted to spread cypresses and pines across the hills with his crippled body...

Planting trees and afforesting, even for a healthy person, is not an easy task. For Fu Benfa, who can barely walk, it is as difficult as climbing to the sky!

His legs are no thicker than an adult's arm. Each step forward requires five or six actions: first, he shifts his body weight to one crutch, then struggles to move the other crutch. When his weight is evenly distributed on both crutches, he then drags his legs forward, repeating this cycle endlessly. Going uphill, he has to crawl on his hands; going downhill, he has to squat and slide. Crossing rivers and climbing over ridges is even more miserable. Fu Benfa, as long as he is alive, will not stop digging. From then on, in the deep mountains and barren hills of Gaocheng Town, Hubei Province, whether it is the scorching summer or the bitter cold of winter, people will see a disabled young man, carrying strange tools, sitting in rock crevices, digging tirelessly. A normal person can dig a one-square-meter tree pit in half an hour, but he has to change positions constantly and it takes at least two days! What troubles him the most is his incontinence. In winter, his pants are wet and freezing; in summer, the smell is unbearable! But none of this can shake his resolve to plant trees. In nine years, he has worn out more than 50 grass pads, replaced his hoe and shovel eight times, and planted more than 2,300 trees and nurtured more than 2,700 seedlings! He also studies tree planting and afforestation techniques diligently, constantly summarizing his experiences.

In 1980, the first batch of poplars he planted now stand tall, with the thickest trunk diameter reaching 18 centimeters.

The earth's springs all gush forth beauty, and the green mountains are everywhere. Fu Benfa's deeds have spread to every household, touching the hearts of millions.

In 1984, Ge Youda, a retired worker from the Fengfeng Mining Bureau in Handan, Hebei Province, traveled thousands of miles to Suizhou. He brought with him his accumulated techniques of cultivation and grafting, helping Xiao Fu plant trees for free. This old man and young man are as close as father and son. They work together day and night, digging mountains and planting seeds without stopping.

So far, Xiao Fu has been planting trees and afforesting for nearly ten years. Wherever his crutches go, there is a shade of green. He, with his indomitable will, is weaving a green world with the curve of his life, leaving a shade for people.

　　用生命铺洒绿色
    湖北  刘克均  钟先稳
    他恋绿色，爱得如醉如痴。
    绿色爱他，他的生命在绿色中得以延长。
    ９年前，一次意外事故使他成了残废。下肢开始萎缩，大小便失禁，他再也不能站立了……
    当他对生活绝望的时候，一次偶尔从收音机里听到一首名为“请留下一片荫凉”的歌曲，又使他恢复了生活的勇气。“对，我不能这么窝囊地活着。我要拚搏，在拚搏中求生存。”他凝视着村旁的荒山秃岭，他的眼前呈现出一片葱绿；他要用他那残伤的身躯去铺洒漫山遍野的苍松翠柏……
    植树造林，对于一个健康的人来说，也并不是容易的事，对傅本发这个连行走都困难的人来说，真比登天还难！
    他的双腿粗不过成人的胳膊，每前进一步，都要完成五六个动作：先将身体重量移到一根拐杖上，然后吃力地移动另一根拐杖，待全身重点均匀地落在两根拐杖上时，然后吃力地拖动双腿，周而复始，循环往复。上坎时得用手爬，下坡时要蹲下来溜。过河翻坎，更是苦不堪言。他，傅本发，只要生命不息，就要挖山不止。从那时起，在湖北省随州市高城镇的深山秃岭中，无论是酷暑盛夏，还是三九严寒，人们会看见，总有一个残废青年，背着奇特的工具，臀下垫着厚厚的草垫，坐在石缝中不停地挖着。正常人挖一个一米见方的树窝，顶多需要半个钟头，可他却要不断地变换位置，至少也要两天功夫！最使他头痛的还有大小便失禁，冬天裤子湿漉漉，彻骨冰凉；夏天臭味难挡！但这些都丝毫不能动摇他植树的信心。９年中，他先后坐烂了５０多个草垫，换了８次镐锹，共植树２３００多棵，育苗２７００多株！他还刻苦学习植树造林技术，不断总结经验。
    １９８０年，他栽的第一批意杨，如今已拔地参天，最大的胸径已达１８厘米。
    大地有泉皆吐秀，青山无处不成林。傅本发的事迹，传到千家万户，震动了千万人的心。
    １９８４年，河北邯郸市峰峰矿务局退休老工人葛有达，不远千里来到随州，并带来了他多年积累的栽培、嫁接技术，帮小傅义务植树。这一老一少，亲如父子。他们朝夕相伴，挖山不止，播种不断。
    迄今，小傅植树造林已近１０个年头了，他的拐杖所到之处，已是一片绿荫。他，正在凭着自己顽强的毅力，用他生命的曲线，编织一个绿色的世界，给人们留下一片又一片荫凉。
