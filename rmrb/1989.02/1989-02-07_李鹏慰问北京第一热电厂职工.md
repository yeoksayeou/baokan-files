Li Peng visited the Beijing First Thermal Power Plant on the first day of the Lunar New Year to extend New Year greetings to the staff and workers who were on duty.

The Beijing First Thermal Power Plant is a high-temperature, high-pressure thermal power plant. At 11:30 AM, Li Peng, accompanied by Beijing Mayor Chen Xitong and others, arrived at the power plant and shook hands with the plant's leaders, exchanging greetings.

When the plant's director, Wang Kaili, reported that the 1988 production targets had been successfully completed and that the average income of the workers had doubled compared to 1978, Li Peng humorously remarked, "The bonuses must have been substantial," and "Prices have also risen quite rapidly." He also inquired in detail about the comprehensive power generation indicators, coal and water usage for power generation, environmental management, and technological upgrades.

Later, Li Peng and the accompanying officials visited the noisy workshop to extend New Year greetings to the workers who were on duty during the holiday.

    李鹏慰问北京第一热电厂职工
    本报讯　记者赵兴林报道：正月初一，李鹏总理来到北京第一热电厂，向坚守生产岗位的干部、工人祝贺新春佳节。
    北京第一热电厂是一座高温高压热电厂。上午１１时３０分，李鹏在北京市长陈希同等陪同下，来到热电厂，与电厂负责同志一一握手并相互问候。
    当电厂厂长王凯乐汇报到１９８８年生产任务完成得不错，职工人均收入比１９７８年翻了一番时，李鹏风趣地说：“奖金发得不少吧”，“物价也上涨得快了点”。他还详细地询问了电力综合指标、发电用煤、用水、环境治理，以及技术改造等问题。
    尔后，李鹏等同志来到机声隆隆的车间，慰问节日坚守生产岗位的工人。
