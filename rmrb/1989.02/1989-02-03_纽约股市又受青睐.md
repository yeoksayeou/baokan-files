The New York Stock Market is Once Again Favored

Sun Yi

The Tokyo stock market is no longer the sole star. Recently, the New York stock market has also shown signs of unusual prosperity. Since the end of November last year, the New York stock market prices have been continuously rising, breaking the records set after the "Black Monday" crash of the previous year. By January 31, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had risen to 2342.32 points. Although this figure is still 16.2% below its peak, it cannot be compared to the Tokyo stock market, which has already exceeded its pre-crash highest point by 18.5%. However, it has finally emerged from the stagnation of the past year, which is enough to make stockbrokers feel relieved.

The recent rise in the New York stock market is mainly due to the relatively good development of the U.S. economy. A series of official statistics released recently indicate that the U.S. economic growth rate in 1988 reached 3.8%, higher than the adjusted forecasts of most economists; the year-end unemployment rate fell to 5.3%, the lowest in 14 years; the factory operating rate remained at the high level of 84.2%; the fiscal deficit for the first three months of the 1989 fiscal year (starting from October 1, 1988) decreased by 17.8% compared to the same period last year. These figures show that although the U.S. economy has been growing for six consecutive years, it is still in a growth trend. On January 26, the U.S. Department of Commerce announced that the orders for durable consumer goods received by enterprises in 1988 increased by 10.8% compared to the previous year, which further boosted the confidence of investors, thus stimulating the prosperity of the stock market.

The recent sharp rise in the New York stock market is also due to several other factors.

Firstly, brokers have received assurances from President Bush's first press conference that taxes will not be increased. Some brokers even infer from this that President Bush seems to be inclined to reduce capital gains tax. If President Bush can keep his promise, this will help to increase investment returns and make the stock market more attractive.

Secondly, the rebound in the dollar exchange rate has also played a role. Since the beginning of this year, the dollar exchange rate has shown a strong upward trend. Despite the fact that countries like West Germany and France raised their interest rates and sold dollars on January 19 in an attempt to stop the rise of the dollar exchange rate, by January 31 the dollar's exchange rate against the yen and the West German mark had reached 130.13 and 1.87, respectively. The rebound in the dollar exchange rate has made foreign investors more enthusiastic about the U.S. stock market.

Of course, compared to the Tokyo stock market, the New York stock market's recent rise still lacks strength. One reason is that the official interest rate gap between the two countries is large. The current discount rates of the two countries are 2.5% and 6.5%, respectively. Due to the high U.S. interest rate, it will reduce the attractiveness of the stock market to surplus capital. Another reason is that people still have some lingering fears about the future of the U.S. economy. Since the U.S. is already close to full employment, the inflation rate has risen somewhat, and the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates. On January 31, Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan already hinted that to cope with the increasing pressure of inflation, it is possible to adopt a tightening policy. If this happens, it will be a blow to the rapidly rising New York stock market.

### 纽约股市又受青睐

　　纽约股市又受青睐
　　孙毅
    东京股市已不再是一枝独秀，近来，纽约股市亦出现了少有的繁荣景象。自去年１１月底以来，纽约股市价格不断攀升，连破前年“黑色星期一”股市暴跌后的纪录，到１月３１日，道·琼斯３０种工业股票平均指数已回升到２３４２．３２点。虽然这个数字距其峰值尚差１６．２％，也不可同东京股市已超出其暴跌前最高点１８．５％的水平相比，但它终于走出了一年多来徘徊不前的境地。这足已使那些股票经纪人感到欣慰。
    纽约股市的此轮回升，主要得益于目前美国经济比较良好的发展。近日官方发布的一系列统计数字表明，１９８８年美国的经济增长率达３．８％，高于大部分经济学家几经调高的预测指标；年末失业率又降到５．３％这个１４年来的最低水平；工厂开工率仍处在８４．２％的高水平上；１９８９财政年度（从１９８８年１０月１日开始）头３个月的财政赤字比上一年度同期减少了１７．８％。这些数字说明，尽管美国经济已持续增长６年，目前仍呈增长的态势。１月２６日美国商务部公布１９８８年企业收到的耐用消费品订单比上一年增加了１０．８％，这就更增添了投资者的信心，从而刺激了股市的兴旺。
    近日纽约股市的大幅攀升，还有一些其它因素。
    其一，经纪人们在布什总统的首次新闻发布会上又得到了不增加税收的保证，某些经纪人甚至从中推论到布什总统似乎还倾向于削减资本收益税。如果布什总统能够履行自己的诺言，这将有助于提高投资收益，使股市更具吸引力。
    其二，美元汇率的回升也起了推动作用。自今年１月初以来，美元汇率显示出强劲的增长势头，尽管西德、法国等国家在１月１９日纷纷提高本国利率、抛售美元，试图阻止美元汇率的升势，但到１月３１日美元对日元和西德马克的比价分别达到１３０．１３和１．８７。由于美元汇率的回升，促使外国投资者更加热衷于美国的股市。
    当然，同东京股市相比，纽约股市此次回升仍缺乏实力。原因之一是两国的官定利率差距很大，两国目前的贴现率分别为２．５％和６．５％，由于美国利率偏高，将会减小股市对剩余资本的吸引力；二是人们对美国经济今后的走势仍有余悸。由于目前美国已接近充分就业，通货膨胀率有所回升，联邦储备委员会有可能提高利率。１月３１日，联邦储备委员会主席格林斯潘已经暗示，为对付日益增长的通货膨胀的压力，不排除采取紧缩政策的可能性。如若这样，对急剧攀升的纽约股市不啻一个打击。
