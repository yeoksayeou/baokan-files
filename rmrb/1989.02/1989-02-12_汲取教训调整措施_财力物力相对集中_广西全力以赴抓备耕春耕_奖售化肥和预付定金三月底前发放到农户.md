The Communist Party of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and the regional government recently convened a meeting of heads of relevant departments to discuss preparations for spring ploughing. The meeting decided to concentrate financial and material resources to ensure a successful spring ploughing campaign.

The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has decided that by the end of March, 50% of the subsidized fertilizers and 30% of the advance payments, as well as 50% of the agricultural funds, will be allocated to spring ploughing preparations.

The region has stipulated that for every 50 kilograms of commercial grain contracted, 30 kilograms of subsidized fertilizers will be provided. Additionally, 50% of the subsidized fertilizers and diesel, along with 30% of the advance payments from the "three-linkages" policy, will be distributed to households during the spring ploughing period. However, last year, many counties and cities did not implement the advance payments and fertilizers during the spring ploughing period. Instead, they waited until the summer and autumn when farmers delivered their grain before issuing the subsidized fertilizers, diesel subsidies, and grain payments together. The regional government believes that this "open subsidy" approach is detrimental to grain production. Without advance fertilizers, many farmers could not afford to buy high-priced fertilizers, leading to insufficient fertilizer supply during the spring ploughing period and affecting last year's grain production. Learning from this experience, the regional Party Committee and government have decided to insist on the "hidden subsidy" approach this year, ensuring that 210,000 tons of subsidized fertilizers and 150 million yuan in advance payments are supplied and distributed to households by the end of March. At the same time, half of the funds allocated for agricultural films, greenhouse seedling cultivation, and hybrid seed production, amounting to 10 million yuan, will also be used for projects directly related to spring ploughing preparations.

Secondly, efforts will be made to improve the construction of 160 grain-producing township bases. Since 1986, Guangxi has focused on building 30 grain-producing base counties. To further increase grain production, the region will this year, in addition to continuing the construction of these grain-producing base counties, allocate 5 million yuan. The counties and townships are also required to match this amount, totaling 10 million yuan annually, to improve the construction of 160 township grain-producing bases scattered across 53 non-grain-producing base counties and cities. For these townships with significant grain production potential and the ability to provide a certain amount of commercial grain, a concentrated approach of manpower, materials, and finances will be adopted to support "short-term, flat, and fast" projects. This will enable these townships, along with the grain-producing base counties, to shoulder the responsibility of increasing grain production and providing more commercial grain this year.

Thirdly, 350 million yuan in technical contract funds will be provided to 200 key township agricultural technology extension stations to address the financial difficulties in implementing paid technical services for grain production.

### 汲取教训调整措施　财力物力相对集中  广西全力以赴抓备耕春耕  奖售化肥和预付定金三月底前发放到农户

　　汲取教训调整措施　财力物力相对集中    
    广西全力以赴抓备耕春耕    
    奖售化肥和预付定金三月底前发放到农户
    新华社南宁２月１１日电  （记者赖玉章）广西壮族自治区党委、区政府最近召开与备耕、春耕生产有关的区直部门负责同志会议，决定相对集中财力物力，打好备耕、春耕生产第一仗。
    广西壮族自治区决定在３月底以前，把５０％的奖售化肥和３０％的预付定金以及５０％的农业资金，用到备耕、春耕生产上去。
    广西合同定购粮的奖售化肥规定每５０公斤贸易粮奖售平价化肥３０公斤；“三挂钩”中的５０％的平价化肥和柴油及３０％的预付定金，要在备耕、春耕期间发放到户。但是，去年有相当一部分县市备耕、春耕期间没有搞预付定金和预付化肥，而是等到夏秋季农民交售粮食时，才把奖售化肥、柴油的差价款和粮钱一起交给农民。自治区认为，这种“明补”的做法，对粮食生产非常不利。因为没有预付化肥，许多农民又没钱去买高价化肥，这就使备耕、春耕生产得不到足够的化肥供应，使去年的粮食生产受到影响。鉴于这一教训，自治区党委、政府决定今年一定要坚持“暗补”的做法，把预付的２１万吨奖售化肥和１．５亿元预付定金，在３月底以前供应和发放到户。同时，自治区投入农膜、温室育秧、杂交制种等经费的一半，即１０００万元，也要用于对备耕、春耕生产有直接关系的项目上。
    二是抓好１６０个粮食生产乡镇基地建设。从１９８６年起，广西已抓了３０个粮食生产基地县建设。为了增产更多粮食，自治区今年在抓好这些粮食生产基地县建设的同时，拿出５００万元，同时也要求县乡也拿出同样多的钱，即每年１０００万元，把散布在５３个非粮食生产基地县市中的１６０个乡镇粮食生产基地建设好。对这些粮食增产潜力大、能提供一定商品粮的乡镇，采取人力、物力、财力相对集中的办法，抓住“短平快”项目给予扶持，使这批乡镇与粮食生产基地县一样，为今年的粮食增产挑重担，提供更多的商品粮。
    第三给２００个重点乡镇农业技术推广站提供３５０万元技术承包资金，解决粮食生产技术承包搞有偿服务的资金困难。
