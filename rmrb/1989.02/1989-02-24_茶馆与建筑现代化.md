Revisiting Chengdu, I found that Chengdu has changed, becoming more modernized, which of course primarily refers to the most visible buildings. What impressed me deeply was the recently completed Jincheng Art Palace. Its grandeur, innovative design, and complete facilities are unparalleled in the entire southwestern region. However, what touched my heart even more was the magnificent yet unique eaves and stone pillars of the Art Palace, where tables for tea are set up. The architect ingeniously incorporated the most ancient living tradition of the Sichuan people into the modern architectural concept. Whether under the morning sun or in the misty rain, one can see people of all ages sitting in groups, facing the fountain, leaning against the grand hall, sipping tea, and enjoying themselves, creating a serene, comfortable, and harmonious scene.

These scenes may be the result of the deep influence of the living customs passed down through generations by the Sichuan people on the designers, but they more importantly reflect a modern design concept: to perfectly combine high-level, modern new-type buildings with ordinary, popular living needs, so that they have both the charm of modern science and aesthetics and do not lose the distinctive regional cultural characteristics.

During the feudal era, many magnificent and majestic architectural works were created, but under the influence of feudal monarchical politics, the grandeur and majesty of many buildings were often associated with awe and distance. Not to mention the high walls surrounding the imperial palace and the golden decorations under the palace eaves, even the long and high steps and pathways in front of the palace were enough to make the visitors feel their own insignificance and helplessness. Modern architecture, on the other hand, is characterized not only by its concise style and advanced scientific and technological means but also by the fact that this style and means are designed to better meet human needs. Therefore, the modern architectural design concept should be to make buildings more convenient for the people and closer to the people as material resources and scientific technology advance, rather than more closed and distant from the people. However, not all current architectural designs are aware of this. Some buildings that emphasize grandeur, when showcasing their luxury or magnificence to the outside world, unconsciously create a distance from the public. For example, a multi-story building of a research institution in Beijing has no entrance on the front, is surrounded by iron fences on all sides, and the intersections with major roads are blocked by barriers, forming a closed layout. This layout is indeed inconsistent with its extensive social connections, vibrant, and successful work content. Of course, there are also many luxurious buildings that achieve a kind of communication with the public through advertisements and posters, but this is only a kind of approach in the sense of dissemination. In our country, truly modern buildings that consider the public and environmental factors in their layout seem to be rare. In fact, many successful modern architectural designs have achieved success in the perfect combination of modernity with national characteristics, modernity with tradition, and modernity with the people.

With the development of reform and opening up, urban construction will become increasingly modernized. This not only means that the material facilities of buildings will be more advanced but also that the distance between buildings and the people will be closer. It is precisely because of this that modernized architecture and the enduring cultural traditions full of vitality have a point of unity.

　　茶馆与建筑现代化
    路侃
    重游成都，发现成都变了，变得更现代化了，这当然首先是指那些最易见到的建筑。给我印象很深的是刚落成不久的锦城艺术宫。其气势之宏大，造型之新颖，设备之完善，在整个西南地区都是首屈一指的。但更使我动心的，是艺术宫那宏伟又别致的廊檐下和石柱旁的一桌桌茶座。建筑师别出心裁，在现代的建筑构思中，留出了四川人民最古老的生活传统的位置。无论旭日当空还是烟雨蒙蒙，但见老少男女三三俩俩落座其间，面对喷泉，背靠广厦，品茗开怀，怡然自得，一派安宁、舒畅、和谐的场面。
    这些也许是四川人世代沿袭的生活习俗给予设计师深深影响的结果，但它更主要的是反映了一种现代的设计思想，即把高层次的、现代化的新型建筑同普通的、大众的生活需求完美地结合起来，使其既有现代科学与美学的魅力，又不失鲜明的地域文化特色。
    封建时代产生过许多雄伟壮丽、巍然屹立的建筑作品，但在封建君主政治的影响下，许多建筑的巍峨宏大又总是和令人望而生畏、敬而远之联系在一起的。且不说皇宫周围高大的城墙，宫檐下铺金的流饰，单是宫殿前那漫长高远的台阶和甬道，就足以令朝见者感到自己的渺小和无力。现代建筑则不仅以简练的造型风格和先进的科学技术手段为特征，而且这种风格和手段又都是为更能适应人的需要而出现的。因而现代的建筑设计思想应该是因物质材料、科学技术的日益先进而更加方便人民，接近人民，而不是更加封闭，扩大与人民的距离。然而并不是所有的当今的建筑设计都意识到这一点。有些注重气派的建筑在向外界展示其豪华或宏伟时，不自觉地使自己同公众形成一种距离。例如北京一家研究机构的十几层大厦，正面没有门，四周用铁栅栏包围，连接交通干道的路口又遭隔离墩隔离，整个形成一种封闭格局，而这种格局形式与其广泛联系社会、充满活力和成就的工作内容相比，实在是不相协调。当然也有不少豪华建筑通过广告和招贴同公众达到一种沟通，但这只是传播意义上的接近。在我国，真正从建筑布局上考虑到公众及环境因素的现代建筑，似乎还不多见。事实上，许多成功的现代建筑设计总是在现代与民族、现代与传统、现代与人民的完美结合上而获得成功的。
    随着改革开放的发展，城市的建设将越来越现代化。这不仅意味着建筑物的物质设施更加先进，而且也应意味着它与人民的距离将更加接近。同时也正是由于这一点，现代化建筑与富有生命力的悠久文化传统存在着可以统一的结合点。
