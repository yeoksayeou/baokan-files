The tenth year of reform has passed, and people are surprised to find that the 800 million farmers, who were supposed to benefit the most, now have some complaints and grievances.

Farmers say, it's hard to buy daily industrial products!

Industrial products struggle to reach rural areas

In many parts of southern China, farmers have to run around to buy hot water bottles and aluminum pots; in some northern households, unable to buy cloth, they have set up spinning wheels and looms again.

Single-tub washing machines and sewing machines, which urban housewives consider cumbersome, are hard to buy in rural areas and require connections; before the New Year, merchants who went to the city to buy old calendars said: these old papers can be sold as "New Year pictures" once they are taken out of the city...

Relevant data shows that in 1987, the amount of daily necessities purchased by each farmer in China was only one-fourth of that purchased by urban residents. In the first nine months of last year, the growth rate of rural retail sales of daily industrial products was more than 50% lower than that of large cities.

Is the purchasing power of rural areas still low? No. Currently, out of the 400 billion yuan of social surplus purchasing power, rural areas account for exactly half. Excluding about 20% used to purchase production materials, at least 150 billion yuan is waiting to be spent on daily industrial products.

Is there a general shortage of daily industrial products? Even less so. Authorities say that except for a few varieties that are in high demand, there is a large surplus of bicycles, sewing machines, and watches, the "big three" nationwide, and the sales of electric fans, radios, and tape recorders are continuously sluggish.

The difficulty lies in the blocked channels

Businesses are worried about sales, with a large amount of capital tied up and difficult to turn over; farmers are worried about buying, with cash in hand but unable to exchange for goods. The difficulty lies in the "middle link." This is indeed a cause for concern.

In the past, when goods were scarce, the state, in order to solve the contradiction of urban and rural goods supply, basically allocated industrial products to rural areas in administrative blocks. With the gradual enrichment of the market and the deepening of commercial reforms in recent years, the state has significantly reduced the number of planned supply goods. Currently, the Ministry of Commerce's planned supply of daily industrial products has only three items left: sugar, iron wire, and nails. In terms of sales, it has broken through the "single channel" and changed the multi-link circulation model of industrial products entering rural areas through first-, second-, and third-level wholesale stations and then to grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives.

This commercial reform, which aims to change the urban and rural market segmentation and achieve multi-channel and fewer-link circulation, has also brought about "negative effects" in practice:

First, some state-owned wholesale businesses believe that supply and marketing cooperatives can "self-purchase" industrial products for farmers, so they are no longer proactive in organizing goods for rural areas.

Second, some industrial self-sales departments, either only care about their own benefits or are troubled by the lack of a sales network in rural areas, thus only focus on the urban market.

The supply and marketing cooperatives, which have the advantage of "many points and wide coverage," are, however, in an embarrassing situation of being powerless due to lack of funds and goods.

The difficulty of industrial products entering rural areas and the imbalance of urban and rural exchanges directly dampen farmers' enthusiasm for selling agricultural and sideline products. "If industrial products are hard to buy, I won't sell agricultural products," if this continues, it will inevitably affect the supply of food in cities, further affect workers' production enthusiasm, and exacerbate social supply and demand contradictions.

The inspiration from the "Jing Ba" model

Just as farmers lament the difficulty of industrial products entering rural areas, the close cooperation between the Beijing Municipal Electric Appliance Company and the Hebei Province Ba County Supply and Marketing Cooperative has proposed a way to solve the problem.

Ba County is located at the junction of Beijing, Tianjin, and Baoding, with convenient transportation and a relatively developed commodity economy. However, the supply and marketing cooperative has always had a shortage of goods and a lack of funds. The state has relaxed the management of some goods, making it difficult for the supply and marketing cooperative to purchase goods. The Beijing Municipal Commercial System used to be supplied by the Beijing Municipal Electric Appliance Company. In recent years, the four major department stores of the Commercial System have broken away from the traditional supply model and directly established connections with factories. The Electric Appliance Company, although it has a supply of goods, is troubled by the lack of a sales channel in the city, while the supply and marketing cooperative wants to expand its supply of goods but is troubled by the lack of a supply point in the city. Thus, the Beijing Municipal Electric Appliance Company found Ba County Supply and Marketing Cooperative as a "relay point," radiating goods to rural areas. Common situations and intentions prompted these two urban and rural commercial enterprises to become partners.

Urban and rural commercial joint operations have produced huge economic and social benefits, paving a new way to increase the effective supply of daily industrial products in rural areas.

In just two years, the total sales volume of industrial products in Ba County Supply and Marketing Cooperative increased from 452 million yuan in 1986 to 3000 million yuan in 1988, and the sales volume of the Beijing Municipal Electric Appliance Company also exceeded 8.6 billion yuan.

In two years, nearly 30,000 electric fans that were unsold in Beijing became a favorite product for farmers in Ba County. Now, farmers in Ba County not only do not need to leave the county to buy general goods, but even many brand-name washing machines, color TVs, and VCRs that city dwellers envy, Ba County farmers can also buy.

The "Jing Ba" model shows that solving the difficulty of industrial products entering rural areas, state-owned commerce, and supply and marketing cooperatives have a lot to do; it also proves that the channels for industrial products to enter rural areas still need to be further explored.

### 工业品下乡难面面观

　　工业品下乡难面面观
    本报记者　潘岗
    改革进入第１０个年头，人们惊异地发现，“最早得实惠”的８亿农民，如今又添了些许牢骚、愤懑。
    农民说，日用工业品购买难！
　工业品下乡太难
    江南许多农民，为添置热水瓶、铝锅四处奔波；北方一些农家，因购买棉布无望，又支起了纺线车、织布机。
    被城里主妇视为累赘的单缸洗衣机、缝纫机，乡下人要买还得托人；年前进城收购旧挂历的商贩称：这些废纸，运出城就可当“年画”销售……
    有关资料表明，１９８７年，我国每个农民购买的生活资料仅相当于城市居民的１／４。去年１—９月，农村日用工业品零售总额增长幅度，竟比大城市低５０％以上。
    是农村购买力仍然低下吗？不是。目前，４０００多亿元社会结余购买力，农村占了整整一半。除约２０％用于购买生产资料外，至少有１５００亿在待购日用工业品。
    是日用工业品全面紧张吗？更不是。权威人士称，除少数品种花色紧俏外，全国自行车、缝纫机、手表“老三件”大量积压，电风扇、收音机、录音机销售持续疲软。
　“难”在渠道不畅
    商业愁卖，占压大量资金难以周转；农民愁买，手中的钞票换不来实物。卖难买难，卡壳的是“中间环节”。这的确令人忧虑。
    过去，在商品紧缺的情况下，国家为解决城乡商品供应紧张的矛盾，工业品下乡基本上是按行政切块分配的。随着近年来市场的逐渐丰富和商业改革的深入，国家大幅度减少了计划供应的商品。目前，商业部计划供应的日用工业品，仅剩下糖、铁丝、元钉三种。在销售上，也突破了“单一渠道”，改变了工业品下乡必须经一、二、三级批发站，再到基层供销社的多环节流通模式。
    这种意在改变城乡市场分割，实现多渠道、少环节的商业改革，实践中也带来了“负效应”：
    首先，一些国营批发商业认为供销社可以为农民“自采”工业品，因此在组织下乡货源上不再积极。
    其次，一些工业自销部门，或只顾及自身效益，或苦于在农村没有销售网，于是只顾抓城市市场。
    而向以“点多面广”为优势的供销合作社，却因资金缺、货源少，陷入了力不从心的尴尬境地。
    工业品下乡艰难，城乡交换失衡，这直接挫伤了农民交售农副产品的积极性。“工业品买不着，农产品我不卖”，如果任其下去，势必影响城市的副食品供应，进而影响工人生产积极性，导致社会供求矛盾再度加剧。
　“京霸模式”的启示
    正当农民感叹工业品下乡难之际，北京市交电公司和河北省霸县供销社的紧密联合经营，提出了解决困难的思路。
    霸县地处北京、天津、保定三市交界，交通便利，商品经济比较发达。但是供销社货源一直较少，资金短缺。国家放开经营的商品，供销社进货也很困难。北京市一商系统过去都由市交电公司供货。近年来，一商系统的四大商场纷纷摆脱了传统的供货模式，和工厂直接拉上了手。交电公司虽然拥有货源，却苦于在城市没有销售渠道，而供销社想扩大货源，又苦于在城里没有供货点。于是，北京市交电公司找到霸县供销社这个“接力点”，把商品辐射到农村。共同的处境和意愿，促使这两家城乡商业企业成了合作伙伴。
    城乡商业联营，产生了巨大的经济效益和社会效益，趟出了一条增加农村日用工业品有效供给的新路。
    短短两年，霸县供销社工业品销售总额由１９８６年的４５２万元，增加到１９８８年的３０００万元，北京市交电公司的销售额也突破了８．６亿元。
    两年间，近３万台在北京滞销的电风扇，成了霸县农民喜爱的商品。如今，霸县农民不仅买一般商品不用出县，就是许多城里人眼馋的名牌洗衣机、彩电、录相机，霸县农民也可买到。
    “京霸模式”说明，解决工业品下乡难，国营商业、供销社大有作为；同时也证明，工业品下乡的途径，还有待深入开拓。
