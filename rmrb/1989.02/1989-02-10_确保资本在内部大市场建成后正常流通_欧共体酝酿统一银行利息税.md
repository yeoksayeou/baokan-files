Title: Ensuring Normal Capital Circulation in the Internal Market: The European Community Considers a Unified Bank Interest Tax

To ensure the normal circulation of capital after the completion of the internal market in 1992, the European Community today proposed a suggestion to unify the pre-tax deduction of personal savings interest among its member states.

There are significant differences in the taxation of personal savings interest by banks in the European Community member states, with the highest rate being 35% and the lowest being no tax at all. The Commission believes that, after the implementation of the EC's directive on the free movement of capital on July 1, 1990, there may be a trend of private funds flowing to low-tax or no-tax countries for tax evasion purposes, thereby disrupting the normal order of the unified capital market.

Recently, based on consultations with various governments, the new Commissioner for Financial and Tax Affairs, Mrs. Skrivanek, formulated this scheme, which specifies the scope of taxation and exemption as well as the tax rate.

The proposal requires all member states' banks to universally tax personal savings interest, with a tax rate set at 15% as the lower limit. Member states can freely increase the tax rate according to their own situations.

The scope of interest tax exemption includes small savings deposits, European bonds, deposits of third-country nationals residing in the European Community, countries and enterprises that have automatically reported interest payments to their national tax authorities, and interest paid by individuals.

Mrs. Skrivanek said at today's press conference that the Commission's proposal focuses on ensuring the free movement of capital without causing imbalances in the EC's unified financial market. It has the dual effect of encouraging personal savings and strengthening the EC's competitive position as an international financial center.

The Commission believes that while this proposal can basically avoid tax evasion within the EC and the resulting abnormal capital flows, it may lead to the outflow of funds. To prevent this phenomenon, the Commission expressed in the proposal that it will hold talks with relevant non-EC countries to seek their cooperation.

Currently, although the proposal has been approved within the Commission, due to Luxembourg's firm opposition and differing opinions among some member states on the tax rate, it is expected that the EC's Council of Finance Ministers will find it difficult to reach a unanimous decision when reviewing this scheme on February 13.

### 确保资本在内部大市场建成后正常流通　欧共体酝酿统一银行利息税

　　欧共体酝酿统一银行利息税
    新华社布鲁塞尔２月８日电  （记者张健生）欧洲共同体为确保其资本在１９９２年建成内部大市场后能正常流通，欧共体委员会今天提出了一项统一各成员国私人存款利息预扣赋税的建议。
    欧共体各成员国的银行对私人储蓄所得利息的税收差别很大，高者达３５％、低者分文不取。委员会认为，由于税收差别悬殊、在欧共体通过的资本自由流通指令于１９９０年７月１日开始生效之后，很可能会出现以逃税为目的的私人资金向低税或不收税国家流动的趋势，从而扰乱统一资本市场的正常秩序。
    委员会主管财政和税收事务的新委员斯克里维内夫人最近在与各国政府协商的基础上，制定的这一方案对课税和免税的范围及税率作出了规定。
    该建议要求各成员国银行普遍对私人存款所得利息征税，其税率定为１５％，并以此作为征税的下限。各成员国可根据本国情况自由调高税率。
    免收利息税的范围包括小额节余存款、欧洲债券、侨居欧共体的第三国公民存款、银行已向本国税务部门自动申报利息支付情况的国家和企业间交易及由个人支付的利息。
    斯克里维内夫人在今天举行的记者招待会上说，委员会通过的这项建议重点在于保证资本自由流通而不引起欧共体统一金融市场的失衡。它有鼓励私人节余储蓄和巩固欧共体作为国际金融中心的竞争地位的双重作用。
    委员会认为，本建议虽可基本避免欧共体内部的逃税现象及由此而引起的不正常资本流动，但却带来资金外流的问题。为了杜绝这种现象，委员会在建议中表示将与有关非欧共体国家就此事举行会谈，以寻求它们的合作。
    目前该建议虽已在委员会内部通过，但由于卢森堡的坚决反对和部分成员国对税率持不同意见，预计欧共体的财长理事会在本月１３日对此方案进行审议时很难获得一致通过。
