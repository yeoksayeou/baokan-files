	Scientific Fish Farming: Fish on the Plateau
	Fish Flourish at 4,000 Meters Above Sea Level

	People's Daily reports: Not long ago, the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau was shrouded in cold and snowflakes danced in the air. Soldiers of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed here braved the biting cold wind to harvest over 900 kilograms of lively carp from a pond they had dug and built themselves.

	The officers and soldiers of this unit had long relied on canned food, pickled vegetables, and frozen vegetables for sustenance. In early 1986, they completed a pond of over 300 square meters and bought nearly 10,000 fish fry from Jiangsu. However, within a few days, all the fish fry died.

	The unit established an "experimental group" to analyze and study the issue. Based on data and methods provided by research institutions, they treated the spring water containing harmful substances. After more than a year of experimentation, they bought 18,000 carp from inland areas and released them into the pond in April of last year.

	After a year and a half of meticulous care, the largest carp now weighs around 0.8 kilograms. Soldiers who patrol the windy and snowy outposts year-round have realized their wish to eat fresh fish.

　　科学养鱼　鱼上高原
    海拔四千米处鲤鱼扑腾
    本报讯  前不久，青藏高原寒凝大地，雪花飞舞。驻守在这里的人民解放军某部指战员冒着凛冽寒风，首次在自己开挖、修建的鱼塘里打捞出９００多公斤活蹦乱跳的鲤鱼。
    这个部队的干部、战士长期靠吃罐头、咸菜和冻菜过日子。１９８６年初，他们建成了一个３００多平方米的鱼塘，到江苏买回近万尾鱼苗。可没过几天，鱼苗死了个精光。
    部队成立了一个“试验小组”，专门分析、研究，并根据科研部门提供的资料和方法，对含有害物质的泉水进行净化处理。经过一年多的试验，于去年４月从内地买来１．８万尾鲤鱼放入鱼塘。
    经过一年半的精心饲养，目前最大的鲤鱼已在０．８公斤左右，常年巡逻在风雪哨卡的战士实现了吃“鲜”的愿望。
