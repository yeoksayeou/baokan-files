Hubei's New Measures in Cadres' System Reform: Provincial Direct Cadres Sent to Grassroots, Family Members and Household Registration Follow

A batch of excellent section and bureau-level cadres from Hubei's provincial departments are currently leaving the provincial capital with their families to take up leading positions in cities and counties.

Authoritative sources believe this is another breakthrough in the province's cadres' system reform. The first batch of 23 cadres will be sent to 13 cities and 9 impoverished mountain counties. Long-term work by department cadres at the grassroots level, with family members' household registrations following, not only eliminates cadres' worries but also helps cadres overcome temporary views, take root at the grassroots level for the long term, and creates conditions for cadres to be able to go up or down, and to be able to work in cities or rural areas.

　　湖北干部制度改革新措施
    省直干部调往基层　家属随转户口随迁
    本报武汉二月二十七日电  记者龚达发报道：湖北省直机关一批优秀处科级干部正携家带口，陆续离开省城，到地市县担任领导职务。
    权威人士认为，这是该省干部制度改革的又一个突破。第一批出发的二十三名干部，将分赴十三个地市和九个贫困山区县。机关干部长期到基层工作，家属户口随转，不仅免除了干部的后顾之忧，也有利于干部克服临时观点，长期扎根基层，为干部能上能下、能城能乡创造了条件。
