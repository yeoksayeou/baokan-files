　　反映教育改革　关注现实生活   
    电视连续剧《绿荫》试映受好评
    据新华社北京２月１１日电  是生活中常见的事情，是生活中常见的人物，但是题名《绿荫》的电视连续剧试映后受到好评，并将于２月１３日在中央电视台与广大观众见面。
    《绿荫》从教育改革的视角描绘了一所中学里教师和学生的生活。一些性格鲜明的教师和学生形象活跃在屏幕上，他们的行动和心态，反映了我国教育的现状及当前存在的问题，并由此呼吁教育观念的更新和教学方法的改革。
    《绿荫》没有传奇性的情节，也没有刺激性场面，但看过这部八集电视剧的一些教育工作者和评论家认为，这是一部扣动现实脉搏的作品。
    《绿荫》的两位编剧张兴华、高文华是从事中学教学多年的教师。
