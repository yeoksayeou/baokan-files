The renowned writer Ba Jin will welcome his eighth Snake Year this Spring Festival. On the morning of the Dragon Year's Eve, when the reporter visited the quiet residence of the elderly writer on Wukan Road in Shanghai, Ba Jin, who is over 84 years old, was comfortably seated in a leather recliner by the window, basking in the warm sunlight and listening to the melodious piano playing of his granddaughter in the living room.

Since 1986, after completing his five-volume "Random Thoughts," Ba Jin has had to stop writing due to overwork and declining health, often falling ill. He said, "I often receive letters from friends and readers both at home and abroad, but due to the worsening Parkinson's disease, walking is very difficult, and my hands shake badly, so usually, my daughter Xiao Lin helps with the correspondence. Sometimes, in replies to old friends, I will write a few words myself."

Although Ba Jin's health is not good and he stays at home, he is still very concerned about the Chinese literary scene, which he has been a part of for 60 years. Recently, the old man has read many reportage works and is pleased with the rise of this type of realistic literature. He said, "In reflecting real life, reportage is more direct than novels." Regarding the future of Chinese literature, the old man is optimistic and believes that great works will emerge.

Last year, the large literary magazine "Harvest," co-founded by Ba Jin and others in the 1950s, survived the test of significant increases in paper and printing costs. At the beginning of this year, after adjusting the price, "Harvest" subscriptions exceeded 100,000 and was voted by Shanghai citizens as one of the "Top 10 Periodicals of 1988." Ba Jin sighed, "Even in capitalist countries, there are many serious, ad-free, and commercially untainted literary magazines. Why can't we have them?" The old man has always hoped that "Harvest" would not carry advertisements. He said, "I still hold the old view: as a writer, it is the readers, not the businessmen, who support me."

When the reporter asked Ba Jin about his plans for the next few years, the old man thought for a moment and said, "I plan to use these two years to organize my works, letters, and related materials from the past few decades. On one hand, I will hand them over to a Beijing publisher for publication, and on the other hand, I will donate these items to the China Modern Literature Museum."

### “龙尾蛇头”巴金话文学前途　中国会有大作品问世

　　“龙尾蛇头”巴金话文学前途
　　中国会有大作品问世
    本报讯  据新华社记者王齐报道：今年春节老作家巴金将迎来平生第八个蛇年。龙年除夕的上午，当记者来到上海武康路老作家幽静的寓所时，年逾８４岁高龄的巴金正安然坐在靠窗户的皮靠椅上，一边享受着阳光的暖照，一边倾听着从客厅传来的小孙女喧喧弹奏的悠悠钢琴声。
    巴金自１９８６年完成他的五卷《随想录》后，因日夕过劳，体力渐衰，且时常得病，而不得不停止笔耕，在家静心休养。他说：“我经常收到海内外朋友和读者的来信，但由于帕金森氏症越来越严重，走路很不方便，手也抖得厉害，所以朋友们的来信，一般都由女儿小林代劳，有时在给老朋友的回信中我也会写上几句。”
    巴金虽由于身体欠佳，闭门不出，但对于他驰骋６０年的中国文坛仍十分挂念。老人最近看了不少报告文学，对这类纪实性文学的兴起感到高兴。他说：“在反映现实生活方面，报告文学要比小说来得痛快。”对于中国文学的前途，老人表示乐观，认为会有大作品问世的。
    去年，由巴金等人于５０年代创办的大型文学刊物《收获》，经受了纸价、印价大幅度上涨的考验，今年年初起死回生，在调整定价的情况下，《收获》订户竟超过１０万，并被上海市民推选为“８８年十佳期刊”。为此，巴老不无感慨：资本主义国家尚且有许多严肃的、不登广告的、力避商业气的纯文学刊物，为何我们就不能呢？老人一直不希望《收获》刊登广告。他说：“我还是那句老话：作为作家，养活我的是读者，不是企业家。”
    当记者请巴老谈谈近几年的打算时，老人沉思片刻说道：“我想抓紧这两年时间整理一下自己几十年来的作品、书信和有关资料，一方面交给北京的出版社出版，一方面将这些物品捐献给中国现代文学馆。”
