Recently, various levels of leadership in Shaoguan City have taken the initiative to organize farmers to participate in housing insurance, treating it as a practical matter for the benefit of the farmers. The relevant departments of the city have also actively cooperated. The civil affairs bureaus of eight counties have collectively taken on the insurance fees for military and revolutionary martyrs' families, five-guarantee households, and impoverished households in their respective counties, paying a small portion of the relief funds. They have transferred the risk to the insurance companies, changing the civil affairs disaster relief work from a blood transfusion model to a blood production model. The Agricultural Bank has provided loans totaling over 100,000 yuan to solve the temporary financial difficulties of more than ten townships for unified insurance coverage. Currently, all 325,000 rural households in the city have their houses insured, making Shaoguan the first city in Guangdong Province to achieve full coverage.

    韶关实现全市农民房屋统保　近年来，韶关市各级领导把组织参加房屋保险，当作为农民办好事，办实事来抓，该市有关部门也积极配合。８个县的民政局统一包下了本县军、烈属、五保户和困难户的保险费，交出少部分救济款；把风险转嫁给保险公司，使民政救灾工作由输血型变成造血型。农业银行先后贷款１０万多元，解决十几个乡镇统保暂缺的资金困难。目前，全市３２．５万户农民的房屋全部投保，成为广东省第一个统保市。　　（龚克）
