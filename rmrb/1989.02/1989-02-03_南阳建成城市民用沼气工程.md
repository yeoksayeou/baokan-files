Nanyang Completes Urban Domestic Biogas Project

The People's Daily reports: Nanyang City in Henan Province has prioritized environmental protection by investing in the construction of two large biogas fermentation tanks and accompanying facilities. These facilities utilize wine lees to produce biogas, generating 40,000 cubic meters of biogas daily. Over 2,000 households have already started using biogas stoves, and some enterprises have also begun using biogas in their production processes, achieving significant economic and ecological benefits.

Previously, the Nanyang Alcohol Factory discharged over 1,700 tons of wine lees daily, turning the surrounding rivers, including the City Moat and the White River, into black and foul-smelling water bodies. This severely polluted the water sources. After years of dedicated research, the technical staff successfully developed a technology to produce biogas from wine lees.

　　南阳建成城市民用沼气工程
    本报讯  河南省南阳市重视保护环境，投资建成两个大型沼气发酵罐及配套设施，利用酒糟液制取沼气，日产沼气４万立方米，已有２０００多户居民用上了沼气灶，有的企业生产也用上了沼气，经济和生态效益显著。
    南阳酒精厂过去每天排放酒糟液１７００多吨，使护城河、白河变得又黑又臭，严重污染了水源。工程技术人员经过多年的潜心努力，研究成功利用酒糟液制取沼气的技术。
