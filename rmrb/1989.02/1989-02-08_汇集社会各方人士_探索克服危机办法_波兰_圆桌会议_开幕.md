The "Round Table Conference" attended by representatives from various social forces in Poland opened this afternoon at the Council of Ministers' Palace here.

It was announced that the conference was attended by members of the Polish United Workers' Party Politburo, including Interior Minister Kiszczak, the chairman of the National Coordination Council of the Polish Workers' Party, Miłodowski, and former Solidarity chairman Lech Wałęsa, as well as representatives from various parties, social organizations, mass organizations, the church, and the constructive opposition, totaling 57 people. Such a large gathering of prominent figures from various sectors, sitting together to explore ways to overcome the current crisis, is unprecedented in the history of the Polish People's Republic.

Our correspondent learned from relevant sources that this "Round Table Conference" will discuss the legalization of Solidarity, parliamentary elections, domestic political and economic situations and reforms, and national reconciliation.

In a recent television speech, Prime Minister Rakowski pointed out that the "Round Table Conference" is an "event of great significance in Polish political life." The National Revival Patriotic Movement of Poland issued a statement welcoming the convening of the conference and hoping that the conference will "achieve concrete results to meet the expectations of the broad masses of the Polish people."

It was drizzling in Warsaw today. Many Warsaw residents and visitors from other places gathered around the Council of Ministers' Palace. A professor from Warsaw University told our correspondent, "This conference is a brilliant move by the authorities, it is popular." A young man named Stanislaw said, "I hope the conference will achieve concrete results, be quick and decisive, and not engage in long-winded discussions, turning into a marathon." A worker from a Warsaw steel plant told the reporter that he did not have high hopes for the conference. However, this conference is unusual, "it may take dramatic actions," but now it is "too early to comment."

According to Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, February 6, at the first plenary session of the Polish "Round Table Conference" held this afternoon, representatives discussed the domestic economic situation, trade union pluralism, and political system reforms. Opinions differed on the legalization of Solidarity.

Polish Interior Minister Kiszczak spoke first, saying that this conference is a "historic opportunity" for the Polish people. He hoped that everyone would use this opportunity to jointly explore effective ways and methods to serve the economic difficulties and deepen economic reforms. When talking about Solidarity, he emphasized that Solidarity must be "re-established" according to the trade union law, and must ensure that in the future, it will "not take the old road," "not disrupt social stability," and "not plunge the country into tension and anarchy again." Regarding political system reforms, he suggested the establishment of a National Reconciliation Committee or Consultative Committee to study non-conflict parliamentary elections, expand the representativeness of the parliament, including the absorption of the constructive opposition into the parliament.

Former Solidarity chairman Lech Wałęsa said in his speech that he was willing to accept some of Kiszczak's suggestions. He said that he could "make concessions and compromises for the interests of the country," but he insisted that the authorities recognize the legality of Solidarity on the issue of Solidarity.

Chairman of the National Coordination Council of the Polish Workers' Party, Miłodowski, expressed his support for trade union pluralism, believing that trade unions of different tendencies should strengthen their ties.

After the general speeches, the "Round Table Conference" unanimously passed a decision to establish three thematic groups on economic issues and social policies, trade union pluralism, and political reforms.

Polish government spokesman Urban today expressed satisfaction with the progress of the first meeting of the "Round Table Conference."

　　汇集社会各方人士　探索克服危机办法
　　波兰“圆桌会议”开幕
    据新华社华沙２月６日电  （记者汤德乔）由波兰各社会力量代表参加的“圆桌会议”，今天下午在这里的部长会议宫开幕。
    据宣布，波兰统一工人党中央政治局委员、内务部长基什查克、波党工会全国协议会主席米奥多维奇和前团结工会主席瓦文萨，以及各党派、社会团体、群众组织、教会和建设性反对派代表共５７人参加了今天的会议。如此众多的各界知名人士坐到圆桌旁，探索旨在克服目前危机的道路和办法，这在人民波兰历史上还是第一次。
    本社记者从有关方面了解到，这次“圆桌会议”将讨论团结工会合法化、议会选举、国内政治、经济形势和改革以及民族谅解等问题。
    政府总理拉科夫斯基最近在电视讲话中指出，“圆桌会议”是“波兰政治生活中具有重要意义的事件”。波兰民族复兴爱国运动全国委员会发表声明，欢迎这次会议的召开并希望会议“用实际成果来实现广大波兰人的期望”。
    今天华沙细雨蒙蒙。在部长会议宫周围聚集了不少华沙居民和外地来客。一位华沙大学教授在同本社记者谈话时说，“这次会议是当局的一个高招，是得人心的”。一个名叫斯坦尼斯拉夫的青年说，“我希望会议取得实际成果，速战速决，不要高谈阔论，变成马拉松长跑赛。”一个华沙钢厂工人对记者说，他对会议不抱奢望。但是，这次会议非同一般，“有可能作出惊人之举”，不过现在评论“还为时过早”。
    据新华社华沙２月６日电 在今天下午开幕的波兰“圆桌会议”第一次全体会议上，代表们就波兰国内经济形势、工会多元化和政治体制改革等问题进行一般性发言，对团结工会合法化问题意见不一。
    波兰内务部长基什查克首先在会上致词，说这次会议对波兰人来说是“一次历史性的大好机会”。他希望大家利用这一机会，共同探索有效的途径和方法，为克服经济困难和深化经济改革服务。在谈到团结工会时，他强调团结工会必须按照工会法“重新成立”，必须保证今后“不走老路”，“不破坏社会安定”，“不使国家再次陷入紧张和无政府状态”。关于政治体制改革，他建议成立民族谅解委员会或协商委员会，以便研究非冲突性的议会选举，扩大议会代表性，其中包括吸收建设性反对派参加议会等事宜。
    前团结工会主席瓦文萨在发言中表示愿意接受基什查克的一些建议。他说，他可以为国家的利益“作出让步和妥协”，但他在团结工会问题上坚持要当局承认团结工会的合法性。
    波兰工会全国协议会主席米奥多维奇表示赞成工会多元化，认为不同倾向的工会之间应加强联系。
    在结束一般性发言后，“圆桌会议”一致通过了关于成立经济问题和社会政策、工会多元化问题和政治改革问题等三个专题小组的决定。
    波兰政府发言人乌尔班今天对“圆桌会议”第一次会议的进展情况“表示满意”。
