Three years ago, our city had only seven or eight printing factories. Now there are 51, most of which are small rural printing factories. The printing industry is developing blindly, with more disadvantages than advantages.

First, they compete with state-owned enterprises for raw materials, causing a shortage of paper supplies. Some state-owned printing factories cannot print textbooks for schools on time due to a lack of paper.

Second, rural printing factories use improper means to compete with state-owned enterprises. Rural small printing factories have poor equipment and weak technical strength, and their product quality is poor. However, to attract business, they give gifts, bribes, and kickbacks to the people in charge. Some units' handlers, after receiving benefits, do not care about the high prices or poor quality of the printing.

Third, because rural small printing factories are scattered and numerous, it is difficult for the publishing, industrial and commercial, and public security departments to manage them. In recent years, obscene publications, fake trademarks, and fake certificates have frequently appeared on the market. Taking Dongtai City as an example, in October 1988, due to the rampant fake coal tickets, the coal supply department sold an additional 7 tons of coal in one day.

### 我市乡村印刷厂亟待整顿

　　我市乡村印刷厂亟待整顿
    三年前，我市印刷厂只有七八家，现在有５１家，大部分是乡村小印刷厂。印刷行业盲目发展，利少弊多。
    一、与国营企业争原料，造成纸张供应紧张。有的国营印刷厂由于纸张短缺，使学校教科书无法及时付印。
    二、乡村印刷厂采取不正当手段与国营企业竞争。乡村小印刷厂设备简陋、技术力量薄弱，产品质量差，但他们为了争业务，给经办人员送礼行贿给回扣。有些用户单位的经办人得了好处，就不管印刷价格高低、质量好坏了。
    三、由于乡村小印刷厂布局分散、数量众多，出版、工商、政法部门难以管理。近年来，市场上淫秽刊物、假商标、假票证不断出现。仅以东台市为例，１９８８年１０月因假煤炭票泛滥，煤炭供应部门一天就多出售煤炭７吨多。
