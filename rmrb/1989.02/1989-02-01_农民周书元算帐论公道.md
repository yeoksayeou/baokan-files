A couplet is circulating in the rural areas of Linxi County, Hebei Province: "Three prices: flat price, negotiated price, market price; three accounts: longitudinal, lateral, comprehensive." The horizontal couplet reads, "Only with clear accounts can there be fairness." The author of this couplet is Zhou Shuyuan, a farmer from Qianfeng Village in the county.

Zhou Shuyuan's family is a large household of 14 people, managing 37 mu of contracted land. In 1988, according to the grain and cotton procurement contract he signed with the state, the flat-priced fertilizers, diesel, and other supplies provided by the state accounted for only one-third of his needs, with the rest having to be purchased at negotiated or high prices. To buy high-priced fertilizers, diesel, and pesticides, he had to rely on connections and run errands, which exhausted him. Additionally, the intermittent "windmill electricity" caused him significant losses. His two younger brothers were frustrated and said, "If the state doesn't provide us with fertilizers and pesticides, we won't sell them grain and cotton."

When autumn came, there was a dispute among the brothers about whether to fulfill the procurement contract. The second and third brothers insisted on taking the grain and cotton to the market to sell at high prices. They said, "Isn't there a saying now, 'I won't buy high-priced fertilizers and oil, and I won't sell flat-priced grain and cotton'? We can't take this loss either!" Zhou Shuyuan, an educated and meticulous farmer, had already calculated the benefits of the past decade of reforms and the family's annual operating results.

He presented three accounts to his brothers: First, the "longitudinal account." In 1978, his family of 10, with 6 laborers working in the production team, received less than 0.5 kg of grain per person per day, and at the end of the year, they still had to pay the team 60-plus yuan for the grain deficit. In 1988, the family's 20 mu of wheat yielded over 250 kg per mu, plus the autumn corn, sorghum, and other grains, totaling 9,850 kg. The 17 mu of spring cotton and 4 mu of summer cotton harvested 3,900 kg of cotton. After delivering the contracted grain of 900 kg, there was still a surplus of over 8,000 kg. In 1980, when the family contracted the land, the grain yield was only 80 kg per mu, and the cotton yield was 18.5 kg. In 1988, the grain yield reached 490 kg per mu, and the cotton yield reached 60 kg. Although the cost of purchasing production materials was mostly at negotiated or high prices, increasing by 45%, the grain and cotton yields increased by 5.1 times and 2.2 times, respectively. Some grain was sold at negotiated prices, and other grains were sold at market high prices, so the benefits still increased. He said, "The grain sold to the state is only a small part of our family's production. The party's policy has benefited us so much. How can we not take a little loss?"

Second, the "lateral account." He said, "If we talk about farming, it's not very profitable. Even if our family's grain is all sold at negotiated prices and the cotton is sold as first-grade cotton, it's still not as profitable as growing vegetables, fruits, or engaging in commerce and industry. Now, the income from each mu of fruit trees and vegetables is 10 times and 20 times higher than that from each mu of grain and cotton, respectively. Farmers are even less profitable compared to city dwellers who cut hair or sell ice cream. As for color TVs and refrigerators, even two to three thousand kg of grain can't buy one. The reason why the benefits of growing grain and cotton are relatively low is that the prices of fertilizers, diesel, and pesticides are chaotic and rising, and the speculators are causing trouble. Now the government has implemented specialized management and price controls on these production materials, and is also finding ways to regulate the prices of other industrial and agricultural products. We shouldn't be too impatient."

Third, the "comprehensive account." Now, his family has 7 laborers. During the busy farming season, the whole family works together in the fields; during the off-season, 4 laborers go out for labor services, earning over 4,000 yuan annually. Adding the grain and cotton income of 11,503 yuan, minus the agricultural tax, collective levies, and other miscellaneous fees of 516 yuan, the per capita income reaches 991 yuan. He said, "Our family is a dual-income household. The production materials we buy include flat prices, negotiated prices, and some market high prices. The agricultural products we sell are also flat prices, negotiated prices, and some market high prices. Comprehensive calculation of income and expenditure, we can't say we are at a loss."

After calculating the three accounts, Zhou Shuyuan spontaneously came up with the couplet at the beginning. A few days later, his family sold the contracted grain and cotton to the state.

　　农民周书元算帐论公道
    新华社记者  侯志义、周吉仲
    河北省临西县农村如今流传着这样一副对联：“平价议价市场价三种价，纵帐横帐综合帐三笔帐”，横联是“帐清才公道”。这副对联的作者是这个县前冯村农民周书元。
    周书元家是一个有１４口人的大家庭，承包了３７亩责任田。１９８８年，按照他和国家签订的粮棉定购合同，国家供应的平价化肥、柴油只占他需用量的１／３，其他都要用议价、高价买。为了买到高价化肥、柴油、农药，他托门子、跑关系，伤透了心，加上开开停停的“抽风电”，更使他损失惨重。他的两个弟弟气恼地说：“国家不给咱肥药油，咱就不卖给他粮棉油”。
    秋天到了，要不要兑现定购合同，在他们兄弟间发生了争执。老二老三坚持要把粮棉拿到市场上卖高价。他们说：“现在不是流传着‘高价肥油我不买，平价粮棉我不卖’的说法吗，咱也不能吃这个亏！”周书元这个有文化、善于精打细算的庄稼人，对１０年改革给他带来的实惠，以及全家一年的经营效益，心里早就有了谱。
    他给两个弟弟算了三笔帐：一是算“纵帐”。１９７８年，他家１０口人，６个劳力在生产队出工，分得的口粮每人每天不足０．５公斤，年底还要倒贴队里６０多元的缺粮款。１９８８年，全家的２０亩小麦亩产都超过了２５０公斤，再加上秋季的玉米、谷子和其他杂粮，粮食总产达到了９８５０公斤，１７亩春棉和４亩夏茬棉收摘了３９００公斤棉花，除交售定购粮９００公斤，还有余粮８０００多公斤。１９８０年，他家承包土地时，亩产粮食只有８０公斤，皮棉１８．５公斤。１９８８年，亩产粮食达到４９０公斤，皮棉６０公斤，虽说买生产资料多是议价、高价，成本增长了４５％，但粮棉产量却分别增长了５．１倍和２．２倍，一些粮食也卖了议价，杂粮还卖了市场高价，效益还是提高了。他说：“卖给国家的粮食只占咱家一个小零头，党的政策让咱沾了这么大的光，哪能不吃点小亏呢！”
    二是算“横帐”。他说：“要说种粮是不怎么合算。就是咱家的粮食全都卖成议价、棉花卖到一级棉，也比不上种菜、种果或经商办企业赚钱。现在每亩果树和蔬菜的收益分别比每亩粮食、棉花高出１０倍和２０倍。种庄稼的更比不上城里理发、卖冰棍儿的。至于彩电、冰箱，两三千公斤粮食也换不上一台。种粮棉效益比较低，原因之一是化肥、柴油、农药乱涨价，‘倒爷’胡折腾。现在政府对这些生产资料实行了专营限价，对其他工农业产品价格也在想办法整治，我们不能太性急了。”
    三是算“综合帐”。现在他家共有７个劳力，农忙时，全家一齐动手种庄稼；农闲时４个劳力外出搞劳务，每年劳力收入４０００多元，加上粮棉收入１１５０３元，除去农业税、集体提留和其他摊派款５１６元，人均收入达到９９１元。他说：“咱家是亦农亦工的兼业户。咱们买的生产资料，有平价、议价和一部分市场高价，卖的农产品也是平价、议价和一部分市场高价，综合计算收支，说不上太吃亏。”
    三笔帐算完，周书元顺口溜出了开头的那副对联。没几天，他们家就把定购粮食和棉花卖给了国家。
