The *China Music News* revealed that the highly anticipated "Shanghai-Paris World Singing Competition" has encountered difficulties. The reason is that the contract was signed hastily, and the intended sponsors have found excuses not to sponsor it. After reading the details, I was astonished. Some people are too bold, treating such a major cultural activity that involves hundreds of thousands of dollars and affects both domestic and international audiences so lightly. It is said that the funding for this competition has recently seen a turnaround. However, the fact that it once faced difficulties is a lesson for everyone.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, located in the subtropical zone, recently held an ice sculpture exhibition amid mixed reviews. The exhibition used indoor large-area circulating refrigeration to maintain a constant temperature, despite the outdoor temperature being above ten degrees Celsius. The 1,250-square-meter exhibition hall was a winter wonderland with various large ice sculptures and human ice sculptures. In Guangzhou, where many citizens have never seen snow, creating such a cultural "grand gesture" is bound to consume a tremendous amount of oil, electricity, and resources. Some explain that precisely because Guangzhou residents have never seen ice sculptures, the exhibition was organized. Following this logic, not only should we not build replicas of the Statue of Liberty in New York or the Louvre in Paris for the majority of Chinese who have never seen them, but we should also consider building an indoor Gulangyu Island in Harbin and a seaside resort similar to Qingdao's in Xi'an... Is this feasible?

Currently, there are numerous cultural activities, with various competitions, exhibitions, performances, and art festivals emerging one after another. Compared to the past when such activities were rare, this is indeed progress; however, it is still far from meeting the needs of 1.1 billion people. Organizing any cultural activity requires money and resources, which is common sense. Therefore, it is necessary to act within one's means; otherwise, it will not only be unhelpful but also harmful. We must remember that China is still a poor country, with annual fiscal constraints, inadequate fuel, electricity, and transportation, and a low standard of living for the common people. Blindly pursuing grandeur, vastness, and modern standards is obviously impractical and may lead to outcomes contrary to the purpose of cultural activities, resulting in fiscal difficulties and public discontent. Besides overreaching, those organizing cultural activities today are particularly fond of the word "big." A province or city must expand to a national scale; a national event must aim for Asia or even the world: it seems that the broader the scope and the bigger the name, the more glorious. That is a matter for the future when our pockets are full. Doing future things now and doing rich man's deeds as a poor man exceeds the cultural psychological tolerance of the public and society. America has the Oscars, and France has the Cannes Film Festival because they have strong economic backing and other conditions, so they can organize such grand events that are so vibrant and eye-catching. Let's strive to achieve such large-scale competitions and awards as an ideal!

All those who are dedicated to developing China's cultural industry and relevant units should invest more energy and limited funds into the development of basic cultural activities. More dance halls, karaoke bars, and amusement parks should be opened, and more theaters, cinemas, and concert halls should be built, so that ordinary people can have places to entertain and relax after work. This would be more practical than organizing grand but empty cultural "gestures."

### 文化活动何必非要“壮举”

　　文化活动何必非要“壮举”
    顾土
    《中国音乐报》披露，极受各界瞩目的“上海—巴黎世界歌唱比赛”陷入困境，原因是签订协议草率，准备赞助者借故不赞助了。细读之后，惊诧不已。一些人胆子也太大了，居然将这样一个波及海内外牵动各方面耗资百万美金的重大文化活动看得如此轻而易举。据说这项比赛的经费日前有了转机。然而曾经陷入困境的事实，对人们来说，无论如何都是一个教训。
    另据新华社报道，地处亚热带的广州不久前在褒贬不一的议论声中举行了冰雕展。展览会采用室内大面积循环制冷方式维持恒温，尽管室外十摄氏度以上，但一千二百五十平方米的展厅一片冰天雪地，有各种大型冰雕群、人物冰雕等等。在许多市民连雪为何物尚不知晓的广州制造这样的文化“壮举”，其耗油耗电耗资之巨就可想而知了。有人解释说，正因为广州人看不到冰雕，所以才办冰雕展。余此类推，且不说大多数国人没见过的纽约自由女神像、巴黎卢佛宫需要造出几个见识见识，就是哈尔滨也应来个室内鼓浪屿，西安也该引黄海水入潼关修个类似青岛的海滨浴场……这样行吗？
    如今文化活动繁多，各种比赛、展览、演出、艺术节层出不穷。与过去甚为冷寂的状况相比较，确实是个进步；而且，距离十一亿人口的要求，仍嫌太少。举办任何文化活动都需要钱需要物，这是常识。这就必须量力而行，否则不但无益反而有害。需知我国现在仍然是个穷国，财政年年吃紧，燃料、电力、交通都不能充分保证，老百姓生活水平仍然很低。盲目追求华丽、宏阔、现代标准，显然不切合实际，并且可能带来与文化活动目的相悖的后果，造成财政拮据，民众怨声载道。除了不自量力，眼下举办文化活动的人还特别喜欢一个“大”字。一个省一个市的，非要撑成全国的；全国的，则又图亚洲甚至世界的：似乎范围越广、牌子越大越光彩。那是将来的、口袋鼓鼓囊囊以后的事。现在办将来之事，穷汉子做富汉之事，那就超过了民众乃至社会文化心理的承受能力。美国有奥斯卡金像奖，法国有嘎纳电影节，是因为他们有雄厚经济实力作后盾，并具备其他条件，才办得如此红火，惹人眼目。举办那样规模的大赛大奖，我们作为一种理想来争取实现吧！
    一切有志于发展我国文化事业的志士仁人和有关单位，如果将精力和有限的资金更多地投放到基础文化活动的发展上，多开办些舞厅、歌厅、游乐场，多建造些剧场、影院、音乐厅，使普通民众在劳作之余都有娱乐消遣的去处，就比举办大而无当、华而不实的文化“壮举”来得切实一些。
