The European Community Council of Ministers today announced that the Council of Ministers has approved the Commission's March 1988 proposal for an economic science promotion plan aimed at fostering cooperation among European economists to jointly study various economic issues facing the European Community. The plan is abbreviated as the "SPES" plan.

The Council also decided that during the four-year trial period from 1989 to 1992, the European Community will allocate 60 million European Currency Units (approximately $1.115 million) to support this plan through the provision of scholarships, travel expenses, seminar subsidies, and project grants.

The "SPES" plan, as approved by the Council, focuses on the following research topics: microeconomic analysis; economics of European integration; determinants of economic growth in Western Europe; European Community currency and the coordination of macroeconomic and fiscal policies; trade policies and the role of Western Europe in the international labor market; employment and social policy issues in Western Europe; and methodologies and model-making related to the above research topics.

The Commission believes that the "SPES" plan aims to develop Europe's economic research potential by establishing cooperation networks among research institutions in member countries and promoting cooperation among economists. At the same time, the plan encourages young economists working outside the European Community to return and participate in research related to microeconomic issues, the coordination of macroeconomic policies and monetary policies, and social policy issues relevant to the construction of the European Community's single market, thereby providing a basis for the Community's decision-making.

　　欧共体通过“斯佩斯”计划
    促进欧洲合作　开发经济潜力
    新华社布鲁塞尔２月１４日电  （郎振琴）欧洲共同体委员会今天宣布，共同体部长理事会已通过了委员会１９８８年３月提出的一项旨在促进欧洲经济学家合作，共同研究欧共体所面临的各种经济问题的经济科学促进计划，简称“斯佩斯”计划。
    理事会同时决定，在１９８９年至１９９２年的４年试验阶段内，欧共体将拨款６００万欧洲货币单位（１欧洲货币单位现约合１．１１５美元），通过发放奖学金、差旅费、研讨会补贴以及课题补助等形式来资助这项计划。
    理事会通过的“斯佩斯”计划重点研究的课题包括：微观经济分析；欧洲一体化经济学；西欧经济增长的决定因素；欧共体货币以及宏观经济与财政政策的协调；贸易政策及西欧在国际劳动力市场上的作用；西欧的就业和社会政策问题；以及与上述研究课题相关的方法论和模型制作。
    委员会认为，“斯佩斯”计划通过在共同体成员国的研究机构间建立合作网、促进经济学家合作来达到开发欧洲经济研究潜力的目的。与此同时，计划还鼓励那些在欧共体之外工作的青年经济学者回到欧共体，参与研究与共同体统一大市场建设相关的微观经济问题，宏观经济政策与货币政策的协调问题以及社会政策问题，为欧共体的决策提供依据。
