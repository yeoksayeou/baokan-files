The 26th Munich International Security Conference concluded today after two days of discussions. Representatives from the United States, West Germany, Britain, the Netherlands, Italy, and other countries, totaling 170, shared their views and then departed. However, the disagreements between West Germany and the United States over the contentious issue of short-range missile modernization did not disappear. The United States and Western Europe, particularly West Germany, have not reached a final solution due to their conflicting views on this matter.

West German Defense Minister Volker Rühe spoke at the conference, expressing his disagreement with the U.S.-proposed NATO short-range missile modernization plan. However, he advocated for a "significant reduction" in battlefield nuclear weapons, particularly nuclear artillery, and suggested that after NATO adjusts its military structure, the remaining nuclear weapons should be modernized.

U.S. Secretary of Defense Frank Carlucci emphasized the need to modernize NATO's nuclear forces in Europe. He pointed out that this includes tactical air-to-ground missiles, the follow-up system for 88 Lance short-range missiles, and nuclear artillery.

The main disagreement lies in the fact that West Germany advocates for a significant reduction in battlefield nuclear weapons, particularly nuclear artillery, while the United States does not propose a reduction but emphasizes modernization.

The United States explicitly advocates for short-range missile modernization and requires NATO to express its commitment to nuclear weapon modernization when formulating the overall plan. In contrast, West Germany advocates for first adjusting the military structure and then modernizing the remaining nuclear weapons. In terms of timing, the former may refer to before the NATO summit in May this year, while the latter may refer to after achieving results in U.S.-Soviet strategic weapons negotiations and European conventional forces talks.

The differing stances of the United States and West Germany are closely related to the actual political needs of both countries. The United States needs West Germany and NATO to express support for short-range missile modernization now to ensure that the U.S. Congress approves funding and continues development work. More importantly, the United States insists on short-range missile modernization as part of its overall policy towards the Soviet Union and Europe.

However, under the influence of the Soviet Union's repeated disarmament declarations, there is a strong call for disarmament within West Germany. If the ruling party makes a decision on short-range missile modernization now, it will inevitably affect their competitive position in next year's elections. Additionally, they believe that the short-range missiles already deployed will not become outdated in the 1990s.

More importantly, with the development of the European situation over the past two years, the assessments of both sides on some major issues have diverged, and there are subtle differences in strategic goals.

Chancellor Helmut Kohl recently clearly outlined the Federal Republic of Germany's specific vision for European policy. He said, "We have a vision of a 'peace order' that unites the entire Europe," and achieving a common market within the community is an "intermediate stage." Then, the goal is to achieve a "European Union," which is simultaneously the "model and foundation" of the entire European peace order. Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher believes that currently, there are three dynamic forces in Europe: the development of the common market within the community is irreversible, the reforms in the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries provide a "historic opportunity," and disarmament and rapprochement between the East and West are inevitable. He believes these three forces have an "internal connection" and need to be combined. Obviously, West Germany's stance on the short-range missile issue is inseparable from its assessment of the overall European situation and its European policy.

Due to the complexity of the issue, the resolution of the short-range missile modernization problem will depend on the skillful coordination of various actual interests and strategic considerations on both sides. Although both the United States and West Germany emphasize mutual reliance in defense and avoiding "decoupling," as predicted by the West German media, if the disagreement over short-range missile modernization is not resolved at the NATO summit in May this year, the conflict will inevitably become public.

### 美国西德短导现代化分歧何在

　　美国西德短导现代化分歧何在
    新华社记者  翁振葆
    历时两天的第２６届慕尼黑国际防务知识大会今天闭幕，来自美国、西德、英国、荷兰、意大利等国的１７０名代表在各抒己见之后又各奔东西，然而，西德和美国在争论最多的短程导弹现代化问题上存在的分歧并未因此而消失。美国和西欧，特别是同西德在上述问题上因矛盾重重，而未能最后达成解决办法。
    西德国防部长朔尔茨在会上发言，不同意美国提出的北约短程导弹现代化计划，但他主张“大大减少”战场核武器，尤其是核大炮，在北约对武装力量结构进行了调整后，再对留存下来的核武器进行现代化。
    美国国防部长托尔则强调要使北约在欧洲的核武装力量现代化。他指出，这是指战术性空对地导弹、８８枚“长矛”式短程导弹的后续系统和核大炮。
    双方的主要分歧在于：西德主张大大减少战场核武器，尤其是核大炮；美国不提减少，却强调使其现代化。
    美国明确主张短导现代化，并要求北约在制订总方案时就对核武器现代化表示决心；而西德主张先进行武装力量结构调整，然后对剩下的核武器现代化。在时间问题上，前者可能是指北约今年５月首脑会议之前，后者可能是说在美苏战略武器谈判和欧洲常规武装力量谈判取得结果之后。
    美国和西德不同的立场是与两国的实际政治需要密切相关的。美国需要西德和北约现在就表态支持短导现代化，以使美国国会同意拨款，继续进行试制工作。更重要的是，美国坚持短导现代化是其对苏联、对欧洲的总政策的一个组成部分。
    但是，在苏联一个个裁军声明的影响下，西德内部要求裁军的呼声甚高。如果执政党现在作出短导现代化的决定，必然会影响它们在一年后的大选中的竞争地位。此外，它们认为，现在已经部署的短导，到９０年代也不会过时。
    更重要的是，随着近两年欧洲形势的发展，德美双方对一些重大问题的估计也出现了分歧，在战略目标上出现了微妙的差异。
    科尔总理最近明确阐明了联邦德国政府对欧洲政策的具体设想。他说，“我们有一个把整个欧洲联合起来的‘和平秩序的设想’”，实现共同体内部市场是其中的一个“中间阶段”，然后要实现“欧洲联盟”，它同时是“整个欧洲和平秩序的模型和基石”。外交部长根舍认为，目前欧洲有三股活力：共同体内部市场的发展已不可逆转，苏联东欧各国的改革提供了“历史性的机会”，裁军和东西方接近也势在必行。他认为这三股力量有“内在联系”，并要使它们汇合在一起。显然，西德政府在短导问题上的态度是同它对欧洲整个形势的估计和欧洲政策分不开的。
    由于问题的复杂性，短导现代化问题的解决将取决于双方各种实际利益和战略考虑的巧妙协调。尽管美德双方都强调两国在防务上相互依靠，避免出现“脱钩”，但是，正如西德报界所预言的那样，美德在短导现代化问题上的分歧如在今年５月北约首脑会议上仍得不到解决，矛盾必将公开化。
