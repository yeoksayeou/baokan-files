Exxon Chairman Says Oil Prices Will Rise After OPEC Regains Market Control

	New York, February 16 (Xinhua) — The chairman of Exxon Corporation, Larry Rawl, said today at a luncheon meeting of the London Petroleum Institute that with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) regaining control of the world oil market in the early 1990s, oil prices are expected to rise.

	He said, "Oil prices will remain weak and volatile in the coming decades, but by 1992 or 1993, after OPEC regains market control, oil prices will rise." Analysts noted that Exxon's outlook on the oil market differs significantly from that of Shell Oil Company. Shell's managing director, John Jenkins, recently pointed out that under normal conditions, oil prices will not rebound before 1995. Analysts believe that the difference in their forecasts for oil price trends is due to differing assessments of whether non-OPEC oil-producing countries can make up for the reduction in U.S. oil production.

　　埃克森石油公司董事长说    
    欧佩克重掌市场后油价将提高
    新华社伦敦２月１６日电  （记者李宗扬）世界最大的石油公司——埃克森石油公司董事长拉里·罗尔今天在伦敦石油学会的午餐会上说，随着石油输出国组织（欧佩克）在９０年代初对世界石油市场的重新控制，油价可望上升。
    他说，“油价在今后数十年中依然疲软和易于波动，然而，到１９９２年或１９９３年，在欧佩克重掌市场控制权后，油价将提高。”分析家注意到，埃克森石油公司对石油前景的展望同壳牌石油公司的看法大相径庭。壳牌公司总经理约翰·詹金斯最近曾指出，１９９５年前油价在正常条件下将不会回升。分析家认为，两者对油价走势预测有差别，是因对非欧佩克石油生产国能否补充美国石油减产部分能力估计不同。
