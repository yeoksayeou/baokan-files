Arafat Expresses Willingness for Dialogue with Israel

	Shamir Refuses Direct Talks with PLO

	Newspaper Agency Cairo 23 February - The Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization, Arafat, said today at a press conference in Cairo that the PLO has expressed its willingness to hold direct or indirect dialogue with Israel before the convening of the Middle East Peace International Conference under the auspices of the United Nations.

	Arafat also said that after the start of the Middle East Conference, he is willing to negotiate with members of the Israeli government at the Middle East Conference or under the supervision of the United Nations.

	Arafat stressed that the PLO's peace efforts provide a historic opportunity for achieving Middle East peace. He urged Israel to respond to the PLO's proposal.

	Arafat reiterated his willingness to accept a federation consisting of Palestine, Jordan, and Israel, and his willingness to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Shamir.

	Arafat said that Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze conveyed Israel's demands to him during their meeting on 22 February and would also convey his views to Israel.

	Newspaper Agency Paris 23 February - Israeli Prime Minister Shamir tonight in Paris once again called for “direct talks between Israel and its Arab neighbors” to resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict.

	Shamir made the appeal at a reception held by a Jewish community in France. He said that it is in such talks that people will find ways to address the legitimate rights of the Palestinians.

	During his stay in France, Shamir continued to insist on his opposition to any dialogue with the PLO and to the convening of an international peace conference on the Middle East.

	According to French newspapers, Shamir particularly emphasized the need for direct talks between Israel, Arab countries, and Palestinians in the Palestinian territories under the supervision of the United States and the Soviet Union.

	Israel's stance is far from that of France and other European countries that support the convening of an international conference and the role of the PLO in resolving the Middle East conflict.

　　阿拉法特表示巴解愿同以色列对话
    沙米尔拒绝与巴解直接谈判
    新华社开罗２月２３日电  巴勒斯坦解放组织执委会主席阿拉法特今天在开罗举行的一次记者招待会上说，巴解组织已经表示，在联合国主持下的中东和平国际会议召开之前，愿同以色列举行直接或间接对话。
    阿拉法特还说，在中东和会开始后，他愿同以色列政府的成员在中东和会上或在联合国监督下举行谈判。
    阿拉法特强调说，巴解组织的和平努力为实现中东和平提供了一个历史性的机会。他敦促以色列响应巴解的建议。
    阿拉法特重申，他愿意接受由巴勒斯坦、约旦和以色列组成一个３国邦联，并愿意会见以色列总理沙米尔。
    阿拉法特说，苏联外长谢瓦尔德纳泽２２日同他会谈时对他转述了以色列的要求，并将把他的观点也转告给以色列。
    新华社巴黎２月２３日电　以色列总理沙米尔今天晚上在巴黎再次呼吁，“以色列同其阿拉伯邻国举行直接会谈”，以解决以阿冲突。
    沙米尔是在法国一个犹太人社团举行的招待会上发出上述呼吁的。他说，正是在这样的会谈中，人们将找到解决巴勒斯坦人合法权利的方法。
    在法国逗留期间，沙米尔仍坚持反对同巴解组织举行任何对话和召开中东国际和平会议的立场。
    据法国报纸报道，沙米尔特别强调在美苏监督下举行以色列、阿拉伯国家和巴勒斯坦地区的巴勒斯坦人之间的直接会谈。
    以色列的这一立场同法国及其它支持召开国际会议及巴解组织在解决中东冲突中应起作用的欧洲国家的立场相距甚远。
