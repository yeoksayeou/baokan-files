Marshal Chervov reveals that during the Sino-Soviet summit, the Soviet Union will announce the location and timeline for the reduction of 200,000 troops in the East

	New China News Agency, Moscow, February 10 (Reporter Sheng Shiliang) Marshal Chervov, Director of the Soviet Union's Ministry of Defense, revealed today at a press conference here that the Soviet Union will announce its military strength in the Far East and Asia, as well as the location and timeline for the reduction of 200,000 troops in the East, during the Sino-Soviet summit in May this year. It may also announce other major measures for the reduction of troops in Asia.

	He said that the primary reason for the Soviet Union's decision to significantly reduce its troops in Asia is the improvement of Sino-Soviet relations.

	When discussing the situation in Afghanistan, he said that the Soviet Union's intervention in Afghanistan in 1979 was not the best solution to the problem. He said that the current situation in Afghanistan is complex, and he hopes that the Kabul authorities will use the combat experience and weapons provided by the Soviet Union to maintain their rule. He does not dare to predict whether they can avoid civil war in Afghanistan.

	Chervov pointed out that the Soviet Union has reduced its troops in Europe by 240,000, and together with the reduction of 56,300 troops by other Warsaw Pact countries, a total of nearly 300,000 troops have been reduced. The total military expenditure of the Warsaw Pact countries will be reduced by 13.6%. In addition to reducing 2,000 tanks due to the reduction of six tank divisions in East Europe, another 3,300 tanks will be reduced from the remaining troops stationed there. He said that due to the unilateral reduction of 500,000 troops, the Soviet Union will also disband several military districts, combined-arms armies, and many divisions.

　　切尔沃夫上将透露在苏中最高级会晤期间    
    苏将公布东部裁军２０万地点和时间表
    新华社莫斯科２月１０日电  （记者盛世良）苏联国防部局长切尔沃夫上将今天在这里举行的记者招待会上透露，苏联将在今年５月份举行中苏最高级会晤期间公布其远东和亚洲的军事实力以及在东部裁军２０万的地点和时间表，并可能宣布苏联在亚洲裁军的其他重大措施。
    他说，苏联决定在亚洲大幅度裁军的首要原因是中苏关系的改善。
    他在谈到阿富汗形势时说，苏联在１９７９年出兵阿富汗并不是解决问题的最好方案。他说，阿富汗目前形势复杂，希望喀布尔当局运用苏联传授的作战经验和提供的武器维持统治，他不敢预言是否能避免阿富汗内战。
    切尔沃夫指出，苏联在欧洲裁军２４万，加上华约其他国家裁军５．６３万，共裁军近３０万，华约国家军费总共将减少１３．６％。除了因削减驻东欧苏军的６个坦克师而减少２０００辆坦克外，另将有３３００辆坦克从留驻那儿的部队中削减。他说，苏联由于单方面裁军５０万，还将撤销若干个军区、诸兵种合成集团军和许多师。
