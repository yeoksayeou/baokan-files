Many consumers have expressed concern that any quality issue with a product might only be a small percentage for the manufacturer, but for the consumer, it is 100%. Once this "100%" happens, what should the consumer do? Consumers urgently demand that manufacturers "repair the fence after the sheep are gone"—truly do a good job in after-sales service.

In response to this urgent demand from consumers, the Ministry of Light Industry has decided to ensure from a mechanism perspective that enterprises value product quality, encourage, and promote enterprises to strengthen after-sales service. It has also decided to conduct an evaluation of the best and worst after-sales service units nationwide this year.

The Ministry of Light Industry's Quality Supervision Committee revealed that in 1988, a total of 1,548 letters were received from consumers nationwide complaining about the quality of light industrial products. Only 831 of these complaints were addressed by the enterprises, accounting for just over half of the total complaints. Especially in recent times, some regions have set up fake maintenance points, and maintenance departments and factories have shifted responsibility for "three guarantees" (refund, replacement, repair) to each other. In some cases, various excuses have been used to make things difficult for customers.

To address this issue, the Ministry of Light Industry has decided to launch a large-scale, impactful evaluation activity nationwide, allowing the majority of consumers to act as the main "judges." Good performance will be commended, and poor performance will be criticized, with both good and bad performances being fully exposed.

The Ministry of Light Industry has announced the address of the Quality Supervision Committee, which is organizing this activity: No. 22, Yi Street, Fuxing District, Beijing, and the telephone number: 867854.

　　轻工部公开评选售后服务单位
    红黑两张榜　优劣全亮相
    据新华社北京２月２２日电  （记者杨理科）诸多消费者不无担心地说，任何产品的质量问题对生产企业来说或许只是百分之几、千万分之几，然而对消费者来说却是百分之百。
    一旦碰上这“百分之百”怎么办？消费者迫切要求生产者“亡羊补牢”——确实做好售后服务工作。
    针对消费者的这一迫切要求，轻工业部决定从机制上保证企业重视产品质量，鼓励和促使企业加强售后服务，并且确定今年在全国范围内开展评选最优、最差产品售后服务单位活动。
    轻工业部质量监督委员会透露：１９８８年共收到全国各地消费者反映轻工产品质量问题的投诉信１５４８封，企业处理有结果的回信仅有８３１封，只占全部投诉的一半多一点。特别是最近一个时期，有的地区虚设保修点，维修部门和厂家对“三包”相互推诿，甚至出现以种种借口刁难顾客的情况。
    为此，轻工业部决定在全国范围内开展一次有声势、有交流、有改进的评比活动，让广大消费者做主要“裁判员”，表彰好的，批评差的，优劣一齐“亮相”。
    轻工业部公布了主办这一活动的质量监督委员会的地址——北京阜外大街乙２２号，电话——８６７８５４。
