In early 1970, Comrade Yu Jie voluntarily stepped down from his leadership position and returned to his hometown in Pingjiang County with his children, setting an example for cadres being able to move up and down in their positions. After returning to his hometown, he declined various living arrangements from the organization, built a house on the hillside at his own expense, often worked in the fields to grow vegetables, raise pigs, and tend cattle, and patiently educated his descendants to settle down in rural life. He always maintained a high revolutionary spirit, leading his family to actively participate in the construction of his hometown and making outstanding contributions to changing the poor face of his hometown.

　　喻杰同志遗体告别仪式在长沙举行
    新华社长沙２月１８日电  （记者曹光晖）向中国共产党的优秀党员、久经考验的共产主义忠诚战士、原中央监察委员会驻财政部监察组组长喻杰遗体告别仪式，今天下午在长沙革命陵园举行。
    喻杰２月４日因病逝于自己的家乡湖南省平江县，终年８７岁。
    李鹏、陈云、万里、李先念、邓颖超、姚依林、王震、田纪云、吴学谦、宋平、胡耀邦、秦基伟、薄一波、宋任穷、阎明复、王平、余秋里、张劲夫、耿飚、程子华、习仲勋、王丙乾等同志，以及全国政协、中纪委、国务院办公厅、中共中央办公厅、中组部、财政部、商业部、山东省人民政府和湖南省、岳阳市、平江县的党政领导机关送了花圈。
    国务委员王丙乾专程从北京赶来参加悼念，并介绍了喻杰同志的生平。
    喻杰１９２６年参加农民协会和北伐部队，１９３０年５月参加工农红军，同年９月加入中国共产党。他参加了中央苏区５次反围剿斗争和二万五千里长征，先后任一二九师三八五旅供给部长、陕甘宁边区政府工商厅厅长。１９４５年他作为我党工商界代表随周恩来同志参加国共重庆谈判。建国以后，他历任西北军政委员会贸易部部长、西北财经委员会副主任、中央粮食部副部长、商业部副部长等职。他还曾被选为第三届全国人大代表、第五届全国政协常委。
    １９７０年初，喻杰同志主动退出领导岗位，带着子女回到平江县山区老家安家落户，为干部能上能下，作出了榜样。回乡以后，他谢绝组织上的各种生活照顾，自己花钱在山坡上盖房，经常下田种菜、养猪放牛，并耐心教育子孙安心农村生活。他始终以高昂的革命热情，带领全家积极投入家乡的建设事业，为改变家乡贫困面貌作出了突出贡献。
