The newly established National Dental Disease Prevention and Treatment Guidance Group proposed at its first working conference held recently that an "Love Your Teeth Day" activity should be held annually.

The reporter Ai Xiao reports: The National Dental Disease Prevention and Treatment Guidance Group, established at the end of last year, revealed at its first working conference the urgent trend of dental disease occurrence and development in China.

Minister of Health Chen Minzhang pointed out at the meeting: The way out for China's oral health lies in prevention, which requires the joint efforts of the whole society to achieve.

The World Health Organization, through investigations, has identified the three major diseases currently affecting human health that need to be prevented and treated: cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and dental caries. In the past five years, the average number of dental caries among 12-year-olds in China has increased from 0.89 to 1.16, and the caries rate has risen from 36.67% to 52.5%. Nationwide, there are 200 million dental caries among primary and secondary school students, and 360 million segments with dental calculus. If treatment is to be provided, more than 60,000 dentists would be needed to work for a year. However, there are currently only about 10,000 dentists in the country, making it difficult to complete the oral disease prevention and treatment work for more than 1 billion citizens. Only by mobilizing the masses to master oral health methods and raising everyone's, especially children's, awareness of oral hygiene and tooth protection can the trend of severe dental disease development be stopped.

For this reason, the National Dental Disease Prevention and Treatment Guidance Group initiated the proposal to hold an "Love Your Teeth Day" activity (initially set for September 1st every year) to jointly strive for everyone to enjoy oral health.

This authoritative organization for national dental disease prevention and treatment has set the strategic goal for China's oral health by the year 2000: 50% of 5- to 6-year-old children should be caries-free; the average number of decayed, missing, and filled teeth among 12-year-olds should be 1.5 or fewer; 90% of 18-year-olds should retain all their teeth; and the percentage of 15- to 19-year-olds needing scaling and oral health education should be below 40%.

　　新成立的全国牙病防治指导组提议    
    每年开展一次“爱牙日”活动
    本报讯  记者艾笑报道：去年岁末组建的全国牙病防治指导组在日前召开的首届工作会议上，披露了我国目前牙病发生、发展的紧迫趋势。
    卫生部部长陈敏章在会上指出：中国口腔保健的出路在于预防，需要全社会一致努力去完成。
    世界卫生组织通过调查，确定了当前影响人类身体健康、需要重点防治的三大疾病：心血管病、癌症和龋齿。中国在最近的５年中，１２岁年龄组的龋齿数从人均０．８９个增加到１．１６个，患龋率从３６．６７％上升到５２．５％。全国仅中、小学生现患龋齿就达２亿个，有牙结石的区段数３．６亿个。如果进行治疗，需６万多名牙医工作一年。然而，目前全国仅有牙医１万余人，很难完成１０亿多国民的口腔疾病防治工作。只有动员群众掌握口腔保健方法，提高每个人特别是儿童讲究口腔卫生、保护牙齿的自觉性，才能制止牙病严重发展的趋势。
    为此，全国牙病防治指导小组倡议，每年集中一天开展“爱牙日”活动（初定每年９月１日），为人人享有口腔保健而共同努力。
    这个全国牙病防治的权威组织拟定的２０００年我国口腔卫生保健战略目标是：５至６岁儿童５０％无龋；１２岁年龄组每人龋、失、补牙数为１．５个以下；１８岁年龄组９０％的人应保留全口牙；１５—１９岁年龄组需要洁治和口腔卫生教育的人在４０％以下。
