    On the matter of Chen Jun and others writing letters to collect signatures
    A relevant official from the Ministry of Justice issued a statement
    New China News Agency, Beijing, February 22 — Today, our reporter visited relevant officials from the Ministry of Justice regarding recent foreign media reports on Chen Jun and others writing letters to collect signatures demanding the release of Wei Jingsheng.

    The official said, "I have also seen these reports. It seems that Chen Jun and others initiated a letter demanding the release of Wei Jingsheng, which is essentially an attempt to create public opinion, put pressure on the government, and interfere with the country's judicial proceedings."

    He said, "Wei Jingsheng was sentenced to 15 years in prison by the Beijing Intermediate People's Court on October 19, 1979, for providing military intelligence to foreigners and engaging in counter-revolutionary incitement."

    The official pointed out that the people's court made its judgment based on Wei Jingsheng's criminal facts according to the law. According to the provisions of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, the court's judgment is completely independent. After the judgment takes effect, if the defendant still has different opinions, they should appeal according to legal procedures and have the court handle it according to the law. Political parties, the government, the People's Congress, and any organization or individual have no right to change the court's judgment. Chen Jun and others' attempt to influence judicial independence by initiating signatures to create public opinion and form pressure is against China's legal principles and is therefore wrong.

    He said, "According to foreign media reports, the main initiator of this letter, Chen Jun, was once a contributor to the 'China Spring' magazine published by the reactionary organization 'Chinese Alliance' based in the United States. He openly declared that he would support Fang Lizhi and others through the most influential newspaper in Taiwan to form a 'pressure group' against the Chinese government. I believe that people will make the correct judgment after understanding the true facts."

    He hopes that people will maintain a clear mind, uphold a stable, united, democratic, and harmonious political situation, and make the reform and opening-up of our country proceed more smoothly.

### 就陈军等人写信征集签名事  司法部有关负责人发表谈话

　　就陈军等人写信征集签名事
    司法部有关负责人发表谈话
    新华社北京２月２２日电  本社记者今天就外电、外报最近报道陈军等人写信征集签名要求释放魏京生等人一事，走访了司法部有关负责人。
    这位负责人说，我也看到了这方面的报道。看来，陈军等人发起写信提出要求释放魏京生，其实质是制造舆论，对政府施加压力，干涉国家的司法审判。
    他说，魏京生是在１９７９年１０月１９日因向外国人提供军事情报，进行反革命煽动，而被北京市中级人民法院依法判处１５年徒刑的。
    这位负责人指出，人民法院是根据魏京生的犯罪事实依法对他作出判决的。根据中华人民共和国宪法的规定，法院审判是完全独立的。在判决生效后，当事人如对判决仍有不同意见，应按照法律程序提出申诉，由法院依法处理。政党、政府、人民代表大会以及任何组织和个人都无权改变法院的判决。陈军等人企图通过发起签名的方式，制造舆论，形成压力，以此来影响审判独立的做法，是违反中国法制原则的，因而是错误的。
    他说，据外电报道，这封信的主要发起人陈军曾经是设在美国的反动组织“中国民联”主办的《中国之春》的撰稿人。他公开宣称要通过台湾“最大最有影响力”的报纸，支持方励之等人，对中国政府形成“压力集团”。我相信，人们了解了事实真相之后是会作出正确判断的。
    他希望人们保持清醒的头脑，维护安定、团结、民主、和谐的政治局面，使我国改革开放事业进行得更加顺利。
