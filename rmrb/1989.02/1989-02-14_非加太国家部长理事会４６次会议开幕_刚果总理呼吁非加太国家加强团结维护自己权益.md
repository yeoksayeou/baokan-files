The 46th meeting of the Council of Ministers of the African, Caribbean, and Pacific (ACP) States opened today in Brazzaville. The meeting aims to prepare for the negotiations on the renewal of the fourth Lomé Convention, which will be held from February 15 to 17 in Brazzaville between the ACP States and the European Economic Community (EEC) countries.

The Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Prime Minister of Fiji Kamisese Mara, presided over the opening ceremony. He stated that the task of this meeting is to discuss the report submitted by the Committee of Ambassadors, to establish the organizational structure for negotiations with the EEC partner countries, and to discuss the 1989 budget of the Secretariat of the Council of Ministers. He also mentioned that the establishment of the European Single Market in 1992 will alter the balance between the ACP States and the EEC countries, making this meeting of decisive significance in many respects.

Prime Minister of Congo, Edouard Pongui, delivered a speech at the opening ceremony. He noted that the cooperation between the ACP States and the EEC is a notable aspect of the North-South dialogue. However, he expressed regret that the Lomé Convention has not been able to stably, durably, and justly address the major economic issues faced by the ACP States. He called for the ACP States to strengthen their unity to safeguard their own interests.

　　非加太国家部长理事会４６次会议开幕   
    刚果总理呼吁非加太国家加强团结维护自己权益
    新华社布拉柴维尔２月１２日电  非洲、加勒比和太平洋地区国家部长理事会第４６次会议今天在这里开幕，以便为谈判续签第４个《洛美协定》而将于２月１５日至１７日在这里召开的非加太地区国家—欧洲经济共同体国家部长会议作准备。
    部长理事会主席、斐济总理卡米塞塞·马拉主持了会议开幕式。他说，这次会议的任务是讨论大使委员会提出报告，通过同欧洲经济共同体伙伴国谈判的组织机构，并讨论部长理事会总秘书处１９８９年预算。他还说，１９９２年欧洲单一市场的成立将改变非加太地区国家和欧洲经济共同体国家之间的平衡，这次会议从许多方面来看都将具有决定性的意义。
    刚果总理爱德华·庞吉在开幕式上发表了讲话。他称非加太地区国家和欧洲经济共同体之间的合作是南北对话引人注目的环节，但他对《洛美协定》没有能稳定、持久和公正地解决非加太地区国家面临的主要经济问题表示遗憾。他呼吁非加太地区国家加强团结，以维护自己的利益。
