	Bush Arrives in Seoul
	Emphasizes Economic Ties with South Korea

	Our reporter Zhang Qixun reports from Washington, February 27:

	U.S. President Bush arrived in Seoul today for a brief visit to South Korea.

	In his speech in Seoul, Bush emphasized that the economic relationship between the United States and South Korea is one of the foundations of U.S. diplomacy in Asia.

	He urged South Korea to join the United States in opposing trade protectionism. He said, "Protectionism may seem like a quick fix, but in reality, it is the least effective." Bush assured that the United States will promote "practical, peaceful, and effective dialogue" between the North and South, but he also stated that the United States is a faithful ally of South Korea. The U.S. government "currently has no plans to reduce its military presence in South Korea," he said. "As long as necessary, U.S. troops will continue to stay in South Korea."

　　布什抵达汉城
    强调同南朝鲜的经济关系
    本报华盛顿２月２７日电  记者张启昕报道：美国总统布什今天到达汉城，对南朝鲜作短暂访问。
    布什在汉城发表讲话时强调，美国与南朝鲜的经济关系是美国对亚洲外交政策的基础之一。
    他呼吁南朝鲜同美国一起反对贸易保护主义。他说，“保护主义看起来是捷径，但实际上最行不通。”布什保证美国将促进北南方进行“务实的、和平的和有成效的对话”，但他又说，美国是南朝鲜的忠实盟友，美国政府“目前没有减少在南朝鲜驻军的计划”，“只要需要，美国军队将继续留在南朝鲜”。
