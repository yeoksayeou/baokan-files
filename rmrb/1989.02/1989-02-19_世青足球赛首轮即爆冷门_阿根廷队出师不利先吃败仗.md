The first round of the World Youth Football Championship has already seen an upset. Argentina loses their first match.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Riyadh, February 17th (Reporter Wu Yihong): The final round of the 1989 World Youth Football Championship, held in Saudi Arabia, entered its second day today with seven matches played. Thus, all 16 participating teams have made their appearances.

In the A group match held in the Saudi capital Riyadh, Portugal defeated Czechoslovakia 1-0. The goal was scored just two minutes before the end of the match by Portugal's number 3 player, Paulo Alves, who headed the ball into the net from less than 10 meters away from the Czechoslovakian goal, a very impressive move.

In the two D group matches held in Taif, Iraq defeated Norway 1-0, and Spain surprisingly defeated Argentina 2-1. Local football experts believe that Argentina's loss in the first match will affect their chances of advancing to the next round.

The results of the other four matches were as follows: Brazil defeated East Germany 2-0 in the C group, and Mali drew 1-1 with the United States; in the B group, Costa Rica defeated Colombia 1-0, and the Soviet Union defeated Syria 3-1.

　　世青足球赛首轮即爆冷门    
    阿根廷队出师不利先吃败仗
    据新华社利雅得２月１７日电  （记者吴毅宏）在沙特阿拉伯进行的１９８９年世界青年足球锦标赛决赛阶段分组赛今天进入第二天，进行了７场比赛。至此，参赛的１６支球队全部亮相。
    在沙特首都利雅得进行的Ａ组比赛中，葡萄牙队以１∶０击败捷克斯洛伐克队。这个球是在距全场比赛结束还只有两分钟时，由３号队员保罗·阿尔维斯在捷队门前不到１０米处鱼跃头顶射进的，动作非常精采。
    在塔伊夫进行的Ｄ组的两场比赛中，伊拉克队以１∶０胜挪威队，西班牙队以２∶１出人意料地战胜了阿根廷队。这里的足球界人士认为，阿根廷队首场失利将影响它进入复赛。
