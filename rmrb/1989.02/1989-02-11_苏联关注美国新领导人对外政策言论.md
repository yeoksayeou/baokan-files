The Soviet Union is closely monitoring the foreign policy statements of the new American leadership. The Xinhua News Agency reported from Moscow on February 9 that the Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman, Grjasimov, said at a press conference today that Moscow is highly attentive to any foreign policy statements made by the newly appointed American President and Secretary of State.

Recently, U.S. President Bush mentioned in a statement the possibility of cooperation between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. Grjasimov said, "We can only welcome this," and "We are prepared for such cooperation."

There have also been reports that the U.S. government is reconsidering its stance on prohibiting the export of advanced technology to the Soviet Union. Regarding this, the spokesman expressed the hope that the U.S. would eliminate certain discriminatory practices against the Soviet Union in trade. He said, "In the path of developing mutually beneficial economic cooperation, the Soviet Union advocates the removal of artificial barriers."

Grjasimov also commented on the talks held on Wednesday between representatives of North and South Korea to discuss a meeting between their prime ministers, saying that the Soviet Union "fully supports" contact between North and South Korea.

　　苏联关注美国新领导人对外政策言论
    新华社莫斯科２月９日电  （记者竺承军）苏联外交部发言人格拉西莫夫今天在记者招待会上表示，莫斯科对新上任的美国总统和国务卿的任何对外政策言论都极为关注。
    最近美国总统布什在一项声明中曾谈到美苏两国合作的可能性问题。格拉西莫夫说：“我们对此只能表示欢迎”，“我们准备进行这种合作”。
    近来还有消息说美国政府开始重新考虑禁止向苏联出口先进技术的立场，对此，这位发言人希望美国在贸易上取消对苏联的某些歧视性做法。他说：“在发展互利经济合作的道路上，苏联主张摒除人为障碍。”
    格拉西莫夫还对朝鲜北方和南方的代表星期三举行的讨论双方总理会晤的会谈发表了评论，他说，苏联“完全支持”朝鲜北南双方之间的接触。
