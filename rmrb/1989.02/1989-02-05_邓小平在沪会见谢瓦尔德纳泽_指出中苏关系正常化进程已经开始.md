Deng Xiaoping Meets Shevardnadze in Shanghai, Notes that the Process of Normalizing Sino-Soviet Relations Has Begun

    People's Daily, Shanghai, February 4 — Reporter Zhou Xiangguang: This morning, Chairman of the Central Military Commission Deng Xiaoping met with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze at the Shanghai Western Suburbs Guesthouse. The Soviet Foreign Minister handed over a letter from General Secretary Gorbachev to Chairman Deng, and conveyed Gorbachev's good wishes to Chairman Deng. Chairman Deng also asked Foreign Minister Shevardnadze to convey his thanks and good wishes to Gorbachev.

    Today, Chairman Deng Xiaoping was in high spirits, looking vigorous, and dressed in a dark gray Zhongshan suit as he greeted Foreign Minister Shevardnadze and his entourage at the entrance of the meeting hall. Deng Xiaoping expressed his welcome to the Soviet Foreign Minister's visit. Shevardnadze thanked Deng Xiaoping for taking the time to meet him. Deng Xiaoping said, "This is our first meeting, and there will be more opportunities in the future." Upon seeing the Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Rogov, Deng Xiaoping looked closely and said, "We know each other, that was during the 1950s and 1960s when we were arguing."

    Chairman Deng told the Soviet Foreign Minister, "Last time, Foreign Minister Qian visited Moscow, and now you are coming to Beijing. The process of normalizing Sino-Soviet relations has begun. However, the formal start of the normalization of Sino-Soviet relations is still the high-level meeting, that is, my meeting with Gorbachev."

    Deng Xiaoping went on to point out that the normalization of Sino-Soviet relations requires the removal of three major obstacles. He said, "Three years ago, I proposed that the first step is to resolve the Cambodian issue, and Vietnam must truly withdraw all its troops from Cambodia. On this issue, the Soviet Union has a significant role to play."

    Deng Xiaoping expressed that China hopes to play a role in contributing to peace in the world, and China is committed to creating a relatively long period of international peace, so that China can develop and shake off its backwardness.

    Shevardnadze said, "Today's world is different from the world ten years ago, and the old rules no longer apply." He said, "Chairman Deng is quite right in proposing the establishment of a new international political order. The foundation of this new order is being formed."

    Shevardnadze said, "There are sufficient reasons now to normalize Soviet-Chinese relations. The meeting between Chairman Deng and General Secretary Gorbachev will be a major event. Soviet-Chinese relations will be based on peaceful coexistence."

    At the end of the meeting, Deng Xiaoping, at the request of the guest, signed four copies of the Russian edition of "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping," and then escorted the guests to the entrance, shaking hands and bidding farewell. Shevardnadze wished Deng Xiaoping a happy Spring Festival. (Photo attached)

　　邓小平在沪会见谢瓦尔德纳泽
　　指出中苏关系正常化进程已经开始
    本报上海２月４日电  记者周象光报道：今天上午，中央军委主席邓小平在上海西郊宾馆会见了苏联外交部长谢瓦尔德纳泽。苏联外长转交了戈尔巴乔夫总书记给邓小平主席的信，并转达了戈尔巴乔夫对邓主席的良好祝愿。邓主席也请谢瓦尔德纳泽外长向戈尔巴乔夫转达他的谢意和良好的祝愿。
    今天，邓小平主席红光满面，神情矍铄，身着深灰色中山装来到会见厅的门厅迎候谢瓦尔德纳泽外长一行。邓小平对苏联外长来访表示欢迎。谢瓦尔德纳泽感谢邓小平抽时间接见他。邓小平说，这是第一次见面，以后机会会更多。当见到苏联副外长罗高寿时，邓主席仔细看了一下说：我们认识，那是在５０年代、６０年代吵架的时候。
    邓主席对苏联外长说，上次钱外长访问莫斯科，现在你来北京，中苏已开始了关系正常化的进程。但是，中苏关系正常化的正式开始，还是中苏高级会晤，也就是我同戈尔巴乔夫的会晤。
    邓小平接着指出，中苏关系正常化要消除三大障碍。他说，三年前我就提出，首先要解决柬埔寨问题，越南要真正地从柬埔寨全部撤军。在这个问题上，苏联是大有作为的。
    邓小平表示，中国希望在世界上扮演一个为和平作出贡献的角色，中国致力于创造一个较长时期的国际和平环境，以使中国能够发展起来，摆脱落后。
    谢瓦尔德纳泽说，今天的世界已不同于十年前的世界，老的规则已不适用了。他说，邓主席十分有道理地提出了建立国际政治新秩序的问题。这个新秩序的基础正在形成。
    谢瓦尔德纳泽说，现在有充分的理由实现苏中关系正常化。邓主席同戈尔巴乔夫总书记的会见将是一个重大事件。苏中关系将建立在和平共处的基础上。
    会见结束时，邓小平应客人的请求，在４本俄文版的《邓小平文选》上一一签名，然后步送客人到门厅，握手告别。谢瓦尔德纳泽祝愿邓小平春节如意。（附图片）
