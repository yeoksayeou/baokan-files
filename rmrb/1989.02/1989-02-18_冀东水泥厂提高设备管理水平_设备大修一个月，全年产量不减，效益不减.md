Jidong Cement Plant Improves Equipment Management

Equipment Overhaul for One Month, Annual Output and Profits Unaffected

People's Daily reports: Correspondent Liu Guosheng reports: The Jidong Cement Plant, recently rated as the largest enterprise in China's building materials industry, achieved remarkable results last year. Despite facing challenges such as a one-month equipment overhaul and price increases for raw materials like coal, electricity, and packaging paper, the plant managed to maintain production and revenue without any reduction. Last year, the plant cumulatively produced 13.25 million tons of cement, exceeding the state's mandatory plan by 550,000 tons and surpassing the design capacity by over 300,000 tons. It set a new historical record with an average monthly production of 1.2 million tons. The plant's profits and taxes exceeded 100 million yuan, with an annual profit of 76.62 million yuan.

Jidong Cement Plant is a modern large-scale enterprise with high standards for scientific management and technical proficiency. In the four years since the departure of foreign experts who assisted in the plant's construction, the workers have relied on their own technical capabilities to manage the modern equipment effectively. The main equipment's operational rate reached 99.5%. During the equipment overhaul last year, they not only solved the problem of excessive temperature in the cement kiln body but also extended the service life of the coal mill airlock valve and the grate cooler grate bars. They also promptly repaired a batch of imported key equipment.

How to manage a modern enterprise, especially in terms of organizing equipment overhauls in enterprises that have introduced advanced equipment, is a significant issue facing China's business community. The leaders of Jidong Cement Plant believe that modern management should be people-centered. They have summarized and proposed a 20-character principle for running the factory: "Equipment is the foundation, technology is the driving force, management is the key, and personnel are the fundamentals." They continuously improve the technical skills of the workers.

　　冀东水泥厂提高设备管理水平   
    设备大修一个月，全年产量不减，效益不减
    本报讯  记者刘国胜报道：新近被评为我国建材行业最大企业的冀东水泥厂，去年在面临设备大修一个月，煤、电、包装纸等原燃材料涨价的困难情况下，仍取得不减产、不减收的好成绩。这个厂去年全年累计完成水泥产量１３２．５万吨，比国家下达的指令性计划多５．５万吨，超过设计水平３万多吨，创平均月产１２万吨的历史最高纪录，利税突破１亿元，全年实现利润７６６２万多元。
    冀东水泥厂是一家现代化大企业，科学管理和技术水准要求很高。在帮助建厂的外国专家离开工厂的４年中，该厂职工依靠自己的技术力量管好现代化设备，使主机设备完好率达９９．５％。去年在设备大修期间，他们不仅解决了水泥窑胴体温度过高的难题，而且还提高了煤磨锁风阀和篦冷机篦板的使用寿命，及时修复好了一批引进的关键设备。
    怎样管理好现代化企业，特别是在引进先进设备的企业里如何组织好设备大修，是我国企业界面临的重大课题。冀东水泥厂的领导干部认为，现代化管理应以人为中心，他们从实践中总结和提出了“设备是基础，技术是动力，管理是关键，人员是根本”的２０字办厂方针，不断提高职工技术素质。
