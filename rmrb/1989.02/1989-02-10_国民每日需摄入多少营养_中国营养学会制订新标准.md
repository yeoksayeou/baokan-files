	The People's Daily reports: To pursue reasonable nutrition and health, the Chinese Nutrition Society has revised the "Recommended Dietary Allowances" (RDA) for Chinese citizens, which will be officially published soon.

	The Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA) is a set of guidelines for the daily intake of essential nutrients based on scientific research and the dietary habits of the Chinese people. It serves as an important reference for maintaining the health of ordinary individuals. Since 1949, the World Health Organization and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations have organized experts to discuss the requirements for various nutrients. In the 1970s, the International Union of Nutritional Sciences established the International RDA Committee to guide the development of global health standards.

	In 1981, the Chinese Nutrition Society officially adopted the first relatively comprehensive "Recommended Dietary Allowances" for Chinese citizens. Several years of practice have shown that some indicators need further adjustment. According to experts who led the revision work, this revision includes fifteen items: energy, protein, fat, calcium, iron, zinc, selenium, iodine, vitamin A equivalents (vitamin A and carotene), vitamin D, vitamin E, thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, and vitamin C. Among these, zinc, selenium, iodine, and vitamin E are newly added items.

	In the revised "Recommended Dietary Allowances," the nutrient requirements for children are the most detailed and specific. The table lists the recommended weights for boys and girls of different age groups to help evaluate the development of children.

	Practice has shown that excessive energy intake by pregnant women can lead to overweight babies, which is not conducive to maternal and infant health. Therefore, the revised table specifies that pregnant women should reduce their daily energy intake by 100 kilocalories compared to the original table. Considering that insufficient calcium intake by pregnant women can affect the bone development of the fetus, the revised table specifies that women in the fourth to sixth month of pregnancy should increase their daily calcium intake by 200 milligrams, totaling 1,000 milligrams per day; during the seventh to ninth month, the daily calcium intake should be 1,500 milligrams. Given the low utilization rate of iron in plant-based foods, the revised table advises pregnant and lactating women to supplement iron as prescribed by their doctors, in addition to relying on dietary iron.

	The revised table specifies an increase in the recommended intake of protein and calcium for adults. To prevent osteoporosis in old age, it is recommended that adults consume 800 milligrams of calcium per day. Additionally, the revised table includes a column for the daily nutrient intake for the elderly, which was not present in the original table.

### 国民每日需摄入多少营养  中国营养学会制订新标准

　　国民每日需摄入多少营养
　  中国营养学会制订新标准
    本报讯  为追求合理的营养与健康，由中国营养学会制订的我国国民“每日膳食中营养素供给量”（简称ＲＤＡ）已于去年十月重新修订，即将由该学会公布。
    膳食营养素供给量是根据科学研究、结合本国人民的饮食习惯制订的每人每日必需营养素的摄入量。它是维持正常人身体健康的重要参考数值。自一九四九年起，世界卫生组织和联合国粮农组织就组织专家讨论各种营养素的需要量。七十年代，国际营养科学联合会专门成立了国际ＲＤＡ委员会，以求指导全人类的健康水平发展方向。
    一九八一年，中国营养学会正式通过了我国第一个比较全面的“每日膳食中营养素供给量”。几年的实践表明，一些指标需要作进一步的调整。据主持这次修订工作的营养专家介绍：这次修订的“每日膳食中营养素供给量”共有十五项，为能量、蛋白质、脂肪、钙、铁、锌、硒、碘、视黄醇当量（维生素Ａ和胡萝卜素）、维生素Ｄ、维生素Ｅ、硫胺素、核黄素、烟酸、抗坏血酸。其中，锌、硒、碘等微量元素和维生素Ｅ等项是新增加的。
    在这次修订的“每日膳食中营养素供给量”表中，对儿童年龄组的营养素供给量要求最为详细具体。列出了每个年龄组男、女儿童应有的体重，以便对照评定儿童的发育是否良好。
    大量实践表明，孕妇摄入能量过多会使胎儿过重，不利于妇幼健康，故在这次修订表中规定孕妇每日摄入的能量比原表减少一百千卡。鉴于孕妇对钙的摄入量不足会影响胎儿的骨质发育，在这次修订表中规定妊娠四至六个月的妇女对钙的摄入量要比原规定每日增加二百毫克，即每日的钙摄入量为一千毫克；怀孕七至九个月时，每日的钙摄入量为一千五百毫克。鉴于植物性食品中所含铁的利用率低，修订表提示孕妇、乳母：不能仅仅依赖膳食中所提供的铁来满足生理需要，要遵照医嘱额外补充铁剂。
    修订表规定成年人对蛋白质和钙的摄入量有所增加。为预防老年期骨质疏松，要求成年人每天钙的摄入量为八百毫克。此外，修订表增加了原表中所没有的老年人每日营养素供给量一栏。
