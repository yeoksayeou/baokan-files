	The Soviet Union's three-year economic reform has achieved notable progress in areas such as the operating mechanism, economic management, production relations, and economic structure. If we count from the 27th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which proposed comprehensive reforms across various sectors of Soviet society, the Soviet Union has been implementing economic reforms for three years. For a country as large as the Soviet Union, three years is not a long time, but as the first phase of economic reform, significant advancements have been made.

	Over the past three years, Soviet economic thought has shed many leftist constraints. Market mechanisms, economic decentralization, multi-component economies, attracting foreign capital, bankruptcy of loss-making enterprises, labor competition mechanisms, and stocks—all previously viewed as capitalist economic characteristics—have gradually been accepted by Soviet people.

	One major measure of economic reform is granting economic entities the right to operate independently. The legal basis for this is the state-owned enterprise law, cooperative law, and individual labor law. As the supply of materials shifts from centralized allocation to wholesale trade, enterprises will have a broader scope for initiative and developing a commodity economy.

	Another significant change in Soviet economic reform is the implementation of comprehensive economic accounting by economic entities. This measure aims to fundamentally address the long-standing issue of enterprises relying on state subsidies, where performance did not affect outcomes. Within enterprises, through contracting and leasing, the relationship between the collective and individuals, and between laborers and means of production, has been tightened and adjusted.

	The reform of the economic management structure is not yet complete, but initial results have been achieved. New comprehensive management plans for the production sector and regional economies have been formulated and are being implemented, with many departments and intermediate management agencies being abolished. The number of personnel in the central departments of the USSR, such as the State Planning Committee, Supply Committee, Science and Technology Committee, and Ministry of Finance, has been reduced by 40%, and the number of personnel at the republic level has been halved. The functions of these central economic departments have changed.

	Taking planning work as an example, quota and state order methods have replaced the previous directive tasks. The relationship between enterprises and state finance has transitioned to a quota basis. Price reform is in preparation, with wholesale prices being changed first, followed by retail prices after public discussion. The Soviet banking system has also undergone reforms, with the number of banks increasing from 3 to 6, including 5 specialized banks. Additionally, commercial banks, cooperative banks, and investment banks have developed rapidly in recent times.

	The Soviet economic structure is also undergoing fundamental reforms, with the aim of improving people's lives and producing final products. For decades, the Soviet economy has prioritized accumulation over consumption, heavy industry over light industry, production materials over consumer goods, raw materials over final products, and military industry over civilian use. Over the past three years, the share of consumption funds in national income has increased from less than 3/4 to over 4/5. In terms of growth rates, the gap between agriculture and industry has gradually narrowed, the development speed of light industry has increased from being lower than heavy industry to being 2.3 times that of heavy industry this year, and the growth rate of final products such as machinery and equipment is several times higher than that of primary products. Military enterprises have expanded the production of civilian goods.

	Overall, the progress of Soviet economic reform has not been as fast as expected, due to various reasons. There are remnants of old ideas in people's minds, and many are uncomfortable with cooperatives, individual labor, and competition; the administrative command management system has accumulated tens of thousands of directives and unreasonable regulations over decades that have not been completely abolished; many managers are either concerned about losing their privileges or find it difficult to quickly adapt to the reforms due to age and professional reasons, consciously or unconsciously resisting economic reform; the five-year plan formulated under the old system must be completed during the transition to the new system, hindering the rapid effectiveness of the new system.

	Currently, it is a period of transition between old and new systems. Before the economic reform fully demonstrates its effectiveness, the Soviet economy will have to go through several quite complex years.

　　苏联三年经济改革的主要成果
    新华社记者  盛世良
    如果以提出对苏联社会各个领域进行全面改革的苏共２７大算起，苏联实施经济改革已３年。对改革苏联这样一个大国的经济来说，３年的时间并不算长，但作为经济改革第一阶段，这期间在经营机制、经济管理、生产关系和经济结构的改革方面，还是取得了明显的进展。
    ３年来，苏联的经济思想摆脱了不少左的束缚，市场机制、经济非集中化、多成分经济、吸收外资、亏损的企业破产、劳动力竞争机制、股票等过去被视为资本主义经济特征的经济现象，已逐渐为苏联人所接受。
    经济改革的一项重大措施是赋予了经济单位自主经营权，其法律依据是国营企业法、合作社法和个体劳动法。随着物资供应由集中调拨为主改为批发贸易为主，企业在发挥经营积极性和发展商品经济方面将有更广阔的天地。
    经济单位实行完全经济核算，是苏联经济改革范畴中发生的又一个重大变化，这项措施旨在从根本上解决长期来企业吃国家大锅饭、干好干坏一个样的老问题。同时在企业内部，通过承包和租赁形式，密切并调整了集体同个人、劳动者同生产资料之间的关系。
    经济管理结构的改革尚未完成，但已有初步成果。生产领域中部门和地区经济的新的总体管理方案已制订完毕，并且在实施中撤销了许多部和中间管理机构。全苏的部和主管部门机关人员裁减４０％，共和国一级的裁去一半。苏联国家计委、供委、科委和财政部等中央部门经济职能发生变化。
    以计划工作为例，用定额和国家订货等经济调节方法取代了过去的指令性任务。企业同国家财政的关系也过渡到定额基础上。价格改革在筹备中，先改批发价格，在全民讨论后再改零销价格。苏联的银行系统也实行了改革，银行由３家变成６家，其中５家是专业银行。此外，商业银行、合作银行和投资银行等各种银行近来发展迅速。
    苏联的经济结构也在进行根本的改革，其方针是着眼于改善人民生活和生产最终产品。几十年来，苏联经济重积累、轻消费，重工业、轻农业，重生产资料、轻消费品，重原材料、轻最终产品，重军工、轻民用。３年来，消费基金在国民收入中的比重由不到３／４上升为超过４／５。就产值增长率而言，农业同工业的差距逐渐缩小，轻工业发展速度由低于重工业到今年为重工业的２．３倍，机器设备等最终产品的增长率比初级产品高几倍，军工企业扩大了民用品的生产。
    总的来说，苏联经济改革的进展不如预期的快，原因是多方面的。人们头脑中存在旧思想残余，不少人对合作社、个体劳动、竞争等看不惯；行政命令管理体制几十年来积累的几万项指令和不合理规定尚未完全撤销；许多管理干部有的担心失去特权，有的因年龄和专业关系难以迅速适应改革，在自觉或不自觉地抵制经济改革；在旧体制下制订的本５年计划要在向新体制过渡的过程中完成，有碍于新体制迅速发挥作用。
    目前正值新旧体制交替时期，在经济改革充分显示其作用之前，苏联经济尚要经历几个相当复杂的年头。
