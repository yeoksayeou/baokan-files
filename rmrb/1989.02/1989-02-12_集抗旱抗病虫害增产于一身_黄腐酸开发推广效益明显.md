The series of products made from humic acid, which combines drought resistance, pest and disease resistance, increased yield, and environmental protection, has increased the income of 2 million mu of farmland in 14 provinces and autonomous regions over the past three years by more than 30 million yuan. Humic acid is a component of humic acid and is difficult to separate from it. In 1979, Vice Researcher Wang Tianli, Xu Xudan, Researcher Chen Rongfeng, and dozens of other scientific and technological workers from the Henan Academy of Sciences developed a method to extract large amounts of humic acid from weathered coal. Subsequently, they used humic acid to develop a drought-resistant and yield-increasing agent, a humic acid salt to prevent sweet potato root rot, black spot disease, and cotton wilt disease, a "multi-effect sugar enhancer" to increase the sugar content of grapes, and a technology to mix humic acid with pesticides to enhance effectiveness and reduce toxicity. Since 1986, these products have been demonstrated and promoted in 14 provinces and autonomous regions, including Henan, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, Liaoning, Zhejiang, and Yunnan. In the past three years, these crops have been promoted cumulatively over 500,000 mu, with a net increase in income of about 20 million yuan.

The use of humic acid mixed with pesticides has a significant effect of alleviating, enhancing, and reducing toxicity. The drug effect can be extended by 3-7 days, the drug amount can be reduced by 1/3, and the number of drug uses can be reduced by 1-2 times.

Recently, experts attending the national humic acid promotion cooperation network meeting in Zhengzhou believe that if this achievement is widely promoted, it will create incalculable value in economic construction, natural science, and ecological balance. In March, Academician Zheng Ping of the Chinese Academy of Sciences suggested that all 400 million mu of wheat in the country should gradually be treated with humic acid for sowing. In this way, wheat production can be increased by 5 billion kilograms each year.

　　集抗旱抗病虫害增产于一身    
    黄腐酸开发推广效益明显
    新华社郑州２月１１日电（记者解国记）集抗旱、抗病虫害、提高产量、保护环境于一身的黄腐酸系列制品，近３年已使我国１４个省、区２００万亩农田增加收益３０００多万元。黄腐酸属于腐殖酸的一个组成成份，很不容易把它从腐殖酸中分离出来。河南省科学院副研究员王天立、许旭旦、研究员陈荣峰等数十名科技工作者，１９７９年研究出从风化煤中获取大量黄腐酸的方法。之后，又相继用黄腐酸研制出抗旱增产的抗旱剂一号、防治红薯根腐病、黑斑病和棉花枯黄萎病的黄腐酸盐、可增加葡萄含糖量的“多效增糖灵”和黄腐酸与农药混合增效减毒技术，并于１９８６年起开始在河南、山西、内蒙古、辽宁、浙江、云南等１４个省、区大面积示范推广。３年来，这几类作物已累计推广５０余万亩，净增收益２０００万元左右。
    黄腐酸与农药混合使用，则具有明显的缓解、增效和降毒作用。药效一般可延长３—７天，药量可节省１／３，用药次数可减少１—２次。
    最近在郑州参加全国黄腐酸推广协作网会议的专家认为，这一成果如大规模推广，将在经济建设、自然科学和生态平衡方面创造出无法估量的价值。中国科学院研究员郑平今年３月就建议全国４亿亩小麦逐步都用黄腐酸拌种，这样每年光小麦就可增产５０亿公斤。
