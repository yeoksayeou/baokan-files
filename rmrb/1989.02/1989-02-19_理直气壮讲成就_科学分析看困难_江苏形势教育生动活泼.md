The past method of situational education, where "I speak and you listen, I criticize and you understand," has been abandoned by various levels of leadership in Jiangsu Province. They respect and trust the people, confidently speak of achievements, and objectively analyze difficulties. Cadres and the masses have further unified their understanding of the current situation, enhancing their confidence and determination to persist with reform.

Starting from late November last year, Jiangsu first conducted situational education trials in over 60 units in cities, rural areas, and universities. At the same time, it focused on training all county-level and above cadres in the province. Subsequently, various places, in conjunction with actual conditions, followed the principle of leading cadres first and then the masses, adopting various forms to carry out vivid and lively situational and task education in cities and rural areas.

Jiangsu Province conducted in-depth investigations and research, categorizing and addressing key issues that the masses were most concerned about and frequently discussed. The Provincial Propaganda Department also compiled and published a series of questions and answers on the current situation in rural and urban areas, respectively, based on different conditions and requirements. These materials were easy to understand, logical, and well-reasoned, and were well-received by the masses. The Yancity Chemical Fiber Factory summarized workers' usual thoughts into ten concerns such as difficulty in controlling economic overheating, difficulty in eliminating inflation, and difficulty in grasping policy changes. They carefully wrote a lecture outline and distributed it to the workers. Through layer-by-layer lectures, training key personnel for thematic guidance, answering difficult questions, and organizing workers to discuss ten issues such as national strength enhancement, successful rural reforms, increased people's income, and changes in their own factory, they encouraged everyone to speak freely, present facts, speak the truth, and speak the truth. This guided the workers' thoughts from "complaining" to discussing reforms and doing practical work.

Jiangsu Province's situational education saw active participation from the masses, who eagerly took the stage to debate, expressing their views freely in a democratic atmosphere. Nanjing, Nantong, and Zhenjiang cities widely carried out activities to communicate and dialogue with the masses. Some places even organized the masses to "switch positions with the leadership" to highlight the masses' principal role, allowing them to educate themselves and view reforms from the leadership's perspective. This increased their understanding of the difficulties faced by the Party and the government, improved communication, and enhanced trust.

Jiangsu Province also focused on strengthening theoretical guidance in situational education, aiming to explain the Party and government's current policies from a combination of theory and practice. This enhanced the masses' rational understanding and psychological resilience towards reform. The leadership and cadres of the Danyang Municipal Party Committee and Government explained the objective necessity and urgency of reform to the farmers.

　　理直气壮讲成就　科学分析看困难    
    江苏形势教育生动活泼
    本报讯  记者孙健报道：过去那种“我讲你听，我打你通”的形势教育方法，已被江苏省各级领导抛弃，他们尊重和信任群众，理直气壮讲成就，实事求是看困难，干部群众进一步统一了对当前形势的认识，增强了坚持改革的信心和决心。
    从去年１１月下旬开始，江苏首先在城乡、高校６０多个单位进行形势教育试点。同时，重点把全省县团级以上干部轮训了一遍。然后，各地联系实际，按照先领导后群众的原则，采取多种形式，在城乡普遍开展了生动活泼的形势任务教育。
    江苏省各地深入实际调查研究，把群众普遍关心、议论较多的热点问题，分类整理，重点解答。省委宣传部还根据城乡的不同情况和要求，分别编辑出版了农村和城市当前形势教育问答若干条，深入浅出，有理有据，一问一答，深受群众的欢迎。盐城化纤厂把职工平时的思想反映，归纳为经济过热难控制、通货膨胀难消除、政策多变难掌握等“十个担心”，认真编写了宣讲提纲发给职工，并通过层层宣讲、培训骨干作专题辅导、难题征答、“我说改革身边事”的演讲活动等形式，组织职工从国力增强、农村改革的成功、人民收入的增加、本厂发生的变化等十个问题的讨论，启发人人讲话，畅所欲言，摆事实、讲真话、讲真理，从而把职工的思想情绪从“发牢骚”引导到议改革、干实事上来。
    江苏省的这次形势教育，群众积极参与、踊跃登台论辩，各抒己见，民主气氛十分浓厚。南京、南通、镇江等市普遍开展了与群众恳谈对话活动。有些地方还组织群众与领导“换个位置看问题”，突出群众的主体地位，让群众自己教育自己，让他们从领导角度看改革，增进了他们对党和政府所遇到困难的体谅，沟通了感情，增加了信任感。
    江苏省对形势教育还在于重点加强理论指导，力求从理论和实践的结合上讲透党和政府的现行政策，增强群众对改革的理性认识和心理承受能力。丹阳市委、市政府领导和机关干部到农民中阐述了改革的客观必须性及紧迫性。
