More than a thousand households of farmers in Dali Village, Fugu County, have achieved six crops in six harvests on 3,000 mu of farmland, with an average yield of over 500 kg of grain and 5,000 kg of vegetables per mu, and an income of 2,000 yuan.

Our reporter Li Jie reports from Zhengzhou: "500 kg of grain, 5,000 kg of vegetables, and 2,000 yuan of income per mu," this is the result of scientific farming by the farmers in Dali Village, Fugu County, Henan Province. In the depths of winter, our reporter visited this village. Deputy Mayor Zhang told the reporter that last year, 1,002 households in this village achieved "six crops in six harvests" on 3,000 mu of contracted farmland, with an investment of over 200 yuan per mu, yielding 525 kg of grain and 5,000 kg of vegetables per mu.

Dali Village is a nationally recognized advanced village in scientific farming. The village party committee and government believe that with a large population and limited land, to further increase the income from grain and economic crops, it is necessary to use scientific technology and adopt intensive management.

In 1984, after Gao Xi, an agricultural expert and provincial labor model of peasant origin, took over as the party secretary of Dali Village, he built on the foundation of two crops in two harvests and, based on years of practical experience, developed the "six crops in six harvests" planting method:

In mid-October, when planting wheat, six rows are left with a four-foot gap, and winter vegetables like bok choy and garlic sprouts with short growth periods are interplanted, covered with plastic film; in the second year, in March, after the vegetables are harvested, melon seedlings grown in a greenhouse are planted in the vegetable field, covered with plastic film and plastic arches; in mid-May, two rows of corn are planted in the six rows of wheat ridges, and in early June, the wheat is harvested, and by mid-June, the melons are on the market, fetching a good price. In late June, the melon vines are pulled out, and autumn vegetables like celery, tomatoes, and peppers are planted in the melon field in a timely manner; in early July, beans or four-season flowers are planted on both sides of the corn; when the corn is mature, only the cobs are harvested and the stalks are not pulled out, using the corn stalks as bean trellises; in early October, the autumn vegetables are harvested one after another, and then the cycle begins again for the next year. This multi-layered intercropping method recently won the third-class "Science and Technology Progress Award" from the Henan Provincial Government.

Mayor Wang Yongji deeply felt that at first, the farmers did not believe it. To promote it throughout the village, Party Secretary Gao Xi convened all village cadres to explain the benefits of scientific planting methods in each village. At the same time, the village provided preferential treatment to the promoting households, with free vegetable seeds, half-price plastic film, and priority supply of fertilizers and pesticides, but in the first year, only 17 households in the entire village adopted the method; in 1986, 120 households in the entire village conducted a "six crops in six harvests" experiment on 200 mu of farmland; by 1987, the "six crops in six harvests" planting area had rapidly expanded to 1,500 mu of farmland contracted by 848 households. Practice made the farmers see the benefits of "six crops in six harvests," and last year, 1,002 households in the entire village achieved "six crops in six harvests" on 3,000 mu of farmland, producing 1.575 million kg of grain and 4.05 million yuan in cash income.

The reporter visited Chen Qiao Village's farming expert Chen Gen-sheng, who was working in the field. He said, "Six crops in six harvests" require more labor and are busier, but the benefits are high, both obtaining grain and earning money, "six crops in six harvests" is a path to prosperity.

It is understood that after Dali Village successfully implemented "six crops in six harvests," nearly 30,000 people from more than 60 counties in Shandong, Hebei, Shaanxi, and this province have come to visit and learn. Starting from the wheat planting season in 1988, the number of households in Dali Village practicing "six crops in six harvests" has increased to over 3,000, and the planting area has expanded to over 5,000 mu.

　　扶沟县大李庄乡农民科学种田    
    一千余户农民在三千亩耕地上一年实现六种六收，平均亩产五百多公斤粮、 五千公斤菜、收入二千元
    本报郑州电  记者李杰报道：“亩产５００多公斤粮、５０００公斤菜、收入２０００元”，这是河南省扶沟县大李庄乡农民科学种田的成果。寒冬腊月，记者到这个乡采访，张副乡长对记者说，去年这个乡１００２户农民在承包的３０００亩耕地上，实现“六种六收”，每亩投资２００多元，亩均产粮５２５公斤、蔬菜５０００公斤。
    大李庄乡是国家命名的科学种田先进乡。乡党委、乡政府认为，人多地少，要使粮食和经济作物收入再跨新台阶，必须运用科学技术、走集约经营的道路。
    １９８４年，农民出身的农业专家、省劳动模范高喜担任大李庄乡党委书记后，在过去两种两收的基础上，根据多年的实践经验，摸索出了“六种六收”的种植方法：
    １０月中旬种小麦时，每种６行留足４尺空档、套种上菠菜、蒜苗等生长期短的越冬菜，用塑料薄膜覆盖；第２年３月蔬菜上市后，在菜地里栽上温室育好的西瓜苗，加盖地膜和塑料拱棚；５月中旬，在６行小麦垄里点种两行玉米，６月初收割小麦，中旬西瓜就上市了，卖个好价钱，下旬西瓜拔秧，在西瓜地里及时种上芹菜、番茄、菜椒等秋菜；７月上旬，在玉米两边点种豆角或四季梅；玉米成熟时，只收棒子不拔秆、玉米秸秆当豆角架；１０月上旬秋菜陆续收完，然后再作第二年的循环，这种多层次的间作套种方法，最近获河南省政府“科技进步三等奖”。
    乡长王永基深有感触地对记者说，起初农民就是不相信。为了在全乡推广，乡党委书记高喜召集全乡干部逐村讲解科学种植法的好处。同时，乡里对推广户提供优惠，菜种不要钱、薄膜收半价，化肥和农药优先供给，但第一年全乡只有１７户采用；１９８６年全乡１２０户农民在２００亩耕地上进行了“六种六收”试验；到了１９８７年“六种六收”种植面积迅速发展到８４８户承包的１５００亩耕地上。实践使农民看到了“六种六收”的效益，去年全乡１００２户农民在３０００亩耕地上实现了“六种六收”，３０００亩耕地产粮１５７．５万公斤，收入现金４０５万元。
    记者访问了正在田里干活的陈桥村种田能手陈根生，他说，“六种六收”劳动量大一些、忙一点，但效益高，既得粮、又抓钱，“六种六收”是个致富的门路。
    据了解，大李庄乡实行“六种六收”成功之后，已有山东、河北、陕西和本省６０多个县的近３万人前往参观学习。从１９８８年种麦季节开始，大李庄乡实行“六种六收”的已经增加到３０００多个农户，种植面积已扩大到５０００多亩。
