Economic revival depends on talent; talent cultivation relies on schools

    The best buildings in our area are schools, and the most respected people are teachers!” Visiting the rural areas of Chenzhou County in Hunan Province, one can see such new scenes and hear such praises everywhere.

    Located in the mountainous region of Hunan, Chenzhou County is rich in natural resources and has relatively convenient transportation. However, due to a lack of talent and low labor quality, economic development has been slow. The county's Party committee and government have realized through practice that economic revival depends on talent, and cultivating talent relies on education. Forming a virtuous cycle of talent cultivation and economic development has become an urgent task for the county. Since 1984, they have promoted the spirit of respecting teachers and education throughout the county, from top to bottom, treating the development of schools as a major task.

    Chenzhou County is a poor county, and developing education requires a large amount of funds. Where can the money come from? The county's Party committee and government have taken the lead in cutting down other expenditures, tapping into all potential resources, and ensuring that educational investments are not reduced. For many years, the county's Party committee has had only one Beijing Jeep, and the higher authorities have allocated five small car quotas, but they have not bought a single one. Some leading cadres often take public buses when going to the countryside. The county's Party committee office is a 50-year-old building, and the county's financial department has allocated 300,000 yuan for renovation three times, but it has been changed to educational funds by the standing committee members each time. The county decided that, in addition to using all the county's discretionary funds for education, 15% of the urban maintenance fees, 25% of the agricultural tax surcharges, and all the urban education surcharges would be directly allocated to the education department for use, and the annual education lump-sum funds would be increased by 7% each year. In 1985, this county suffered a major flood, with direct economic losses of over 30 million yuan, and the county's finances were in serious deficit. To support the construction of central primary schools in various towns, the county magistrate personally borrowed 1 million yuan from enterprises and units, and the county government also borrowed 10 million yuan from the bank to ensure the educational investment needed for that year.

    The exemplary actions of the county's Party committee and government have mobilized the enthusiasm of various towns, villages, and the masses to run schools. According to statistics, in the past four years, the county and township-level educational investments have accounted for 45.6% of the county's total financial expenditures and more than 75% of the township's total financial revenues. Including village-level investments and mass fundraising, the county has built and renovated 270,000 square meters of school buildings, accounting for more than 85% of the total existing school buildings. Now, the vast majority of students can study in spacious and bright classrooms, and many teachers have moved into new three-bedroom apartments with a kitchen and bathroom.

    At the same time, the county has established a system of county, township, and village-level leaders connecting with schools. Each leader has a school as their contact point, often going deep into the schools to conduct investigations and research, humbly listening to the opinions of teachers and students, and promptly solving existing problems. When the county holds important meetings, every meeting discusses education and lists doing practical things for education as part of the job responsibility system for various levels of leadership, as an important basis for the assessment and selection of cadres.

    Chenzhou County has insisted on respecting teachers and education, promoting the development of the education cause. This county has been rated as an advanced county in the province for the popularization of primary education.

　　经济振兴在人才　人才培养靠学校    
    郴县机动财力全用于教育
    新华社长沙２月１３日电  （记者曹光晖）“我们这里最好的房子是学校，最受尊敬的是教师！”到湖南省郴县农村走一遭，到处可以看到这样的新气象，听到这样的赞美声。
    地处湖南山区的郴县，自然资源丰富，交通比较便利，但由于人才缺乏，劳动者素质不高，经济发展却很缓慢。郴县县委、县政府从实践中认识到，经济振兴在人才，培养成才在教育，尽快形成人才培养和经济发展的良性循环，已成为本县的当务之急。于是，从１９８４年以来，他们在全县城乡大兴尊师重教之风，从上到下把兴学建校当作一项重要任务来抓。
    郴县是个穷县，发展教育需要大量经费，从哪里来？县委、县政府就带头紧缩其他开支，挖掘一切潜力，保证每年教育投资一个不少。多年来，县委只有一辆北京吉普车，上级先后分给５辆小轿车指标，他们１辆也没买，一些领导干部下乡常常去挤乘公共汽车。县委办公楼是５０年代建的旧房子，县财政部门曾３次拨出改建专款３０万元，次次都被常委们改作教育经费。县里决定，除将县机动财力全部用于办教育外，还将１５％的城市维护费、２５％的农业税附加和全部城市教育费附加直接拨给教育部门使用，坚持每年按７％的比例递增教育包干经费。１９８５年这个县遭受特大水灾，直接经济损失３０００多万元，县财政严重赤字，为了支持各乡镇建好中心完小，县长亲自到企业单位借款１０万元，还由县政府出面向银行贷款１００万元，保证了当年教育所需投资。
    县委、县政府的模范行动，调动了各乡镇、村和群众的办学积极性。据统计，近４年来，县、乡两级教育投资分别占县财政总支出的４５．６％，占乡财政总收入的７５％以上。加上村级投资和群众集资，全县共新建和改建校舍２７万多平方米，占现有校舍总面积的８５％以上。如今，绝大多数学生都能在宽敞明亮的教室里上课，不少教师住上了三室一厨带卫生间的新房。
    与此同时，全县建立了县、乡、村三级领导联系学校的制度，每个领导都有学校作为自己的联系点，经常深入学校调查研究，虚心听取师生们的意见，及时解决存在的问题。县里召开重要会议，每会必谈教育，并把为教育办实事列入各级领导的岗位责任制，作为考核选拔干部的一个重要依据。
    郴县坚持尊师重教，促进了教育事业的发展。这个县已被评为全省普及初等教育的先进县。
