South African forces invaded Angola on February 8, penetrating 40 kilometers into the country's territory. The invasion was aimed at supporting the military actions of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), an anti-government rebel group in Angola.

The Angolan Ministry of Defense issued a statement on February 9, condemning the South African military's incursion into the southern province of Cuando Cubango. The statement noted that the South African forces advanced under the cover of G-5 and G-6 long-range artillery.

The statement emphasized that South Africa's invasion blatantly violated the New York Agreement signed in December 1988 by Angola, Cuba, and South Africa, which aimed at achieving Namibian independence and peace in Angola. The statement called on the international community to pay attention to South Africa's aggressive actions.
