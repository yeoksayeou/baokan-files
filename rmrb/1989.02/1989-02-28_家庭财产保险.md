	Household Property Insurance

	Q: In recent years, as people's living standards have improved, household property insurance has gradually become popular in many households. Many readers want to know how many types of this insurance there are and how to go about the procedures?

	A: There are two types of household property insurance. The first type is ordinary household property insurance, with a one-year term. For every 1,000 yuan of property value insured, the premium is about 3 yuan. If you insure 5,000 yuan of property, you only need to pay about 15 yuan per year. If an accident occurs within a year, the insurance company will compensate according to the policy; if nothing happens, the 15 yuan premium will not be refunded. The second type is comprehensive household property insurance. This type has a minimum term of three years, and for every 1,000 yuan of property value insured, the premium is 26 yuan. If you insure 5,000 yuan of property, you need to pay 130 yuan. If an accident occurs within three years, the insurance company will be responsible for compensation. If the three-year insurance term expires without any incidents, the 130 yuan will be fully refunded.

	Q: Which types of property can be insured under this policy?

	A: Generally, insurable household property includes housing, clothing, bedding, furniture, household appliances, and other daily necessities, as well as agricultural tools and equipment in rural households. Some items that are difficult to appraise, such as gold, silver, jewelry, antiques, paintings, certificates, and documents, are not within the scope of insurance coverage.

	Q: How do you go about the insurance procedures?

	A: The People's Insurance Company of China handles this type of insurance at its branches and agencies nationwide. The insured must fill out an insurance application form, specifying the value of the property to be insured, the main types of insured property, the household address, and name, and pay the premium in full.

	Q: What should you do if you encounter a disaster or accident after participating in household property insurance?

	A: First, you should notify the insurance company as soon as possible and provide the insurance policy and a list of property losses. You should also obtain written proof from the public security or fire department, as well as from your unit or neighborhood committee. When handling the insurance procedures, the insurance company does not visit the home to inspect the property. However, after an incident, upon receiving the notification, the insurance company will send someone to the home to inspect and verify the property loss. The amount of compensation is calculated based on the extent of the loss and the actual value of the lost property on the day of the loss, but the maximum compensation is limited to the insured amount. For example, if a household's property loss amounts to 6,000 yuan, but only 5,000 yuan of property was insured, the maximum compensation the insurance company can provide is 5,000 yuan. If the insured or their family members intentionally cause property damage, or engage in false reporting or other fraudulent behavior, not only will they not receive compensation, but they will also face legal consequences.

　　家庭财产保险
    问：近年来，随着人们生活水平的提高，家庭财产保险渐渐走进千家万户。许多读者都很想知道这项保险有多少种类，如何办理手续等等？
    答：家庭财产保险有两种。第一种是家庭财产普通保险，保险期限为一年，每保一千元价值的财产交三元左右保险费。如果保五千元财产，每年只需交十五元左右。一年内若出现意外，保险公司照章赔偿；若平安无事，就不返还这十五元保险费了。第二种是家庭财产两全保险。这种保险期限至少三年，每保一千元价值的财产需交保险费二十六元。如果保五千元的财产，需交一百三十元。三年内若发生意外，保险公司负责赔偿。若三年保险期满平安无事，一百三十元全部归还。
    问：哪些财产可以投保这项保险？
    答：一般来讲，可以保险的家庭财产包括房屋、衣物、卧具、家具、家用电器等生活资料和农村家庭中的农具、工具。一些难于鉴定价值的财产，如金银、首饰、珠宝、古玩、字画、证书、文件等不在保险范围之内。
    问：怎样办理投保手续？
    答：中国人民保险公司在全国各地的分支公司或代办处均办理此项保险。投保人要在保险申请单上，写明要保多少价值的财产，保险的财产主要有哪些，家庭住址和姓名等，并一次交清保险费。
    问：参加家庭财产保险后，一旦遭受灾害事故应当怎么办？
    答：首先，要尽快通知保险公司，并提供保险单和财产损失清单，同时还应出具公安或消防部门及所在单位、街道的书面证明。在办理投保手续时，保险公司不到家里查看财产。但出事后，保险公司接到通知，则要派人到家中查看，核实财产损失情况。赔款数额按损失多少和损失财产当天的实际价值计算，但最高赔款以保险金额为限。如某家庭的财产损失共计六千元，而只投保了五千元的财产，那么保险公司赔偿的最高金额只能是五千元。如果投保人或其家庭成员故意造成财产损失，或有虚报及其他欺骗行为不仅得不到赔偿，还要追究法律责任。
