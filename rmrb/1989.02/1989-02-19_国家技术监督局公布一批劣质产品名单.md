	Jiangsu Rudong County Hulu Phosphorus Fertilizer Factory	Phosphorus Fertilizer	The effective phosphorus content was only 5.7%, failing to meet the requirement of greater than or equal to 12.0%. The moisture content was as high as 21%.

	Guangdong Qu Ren Tien Snail Mine	Power Coal	The ash content of the raw coal produced in July 1988 was reported as 22.38%, but the actual test result was 41.13%, far exceeding the 4% allowable deviation.

	Guangzhou Zhujiang Radio Factory	Jiangda Brand ST-2800 Type Radio-Cassette Player	Two samples failed the safety electrical strength test, with the power transformer breaking down at 2kV, not meeting the standard of greater than or equal to 3kV.

	Shanghai Xiangyang Radio Components Factory	1kW Silicon Carbide Plate	5 indicators were unqualified, including 1 fatal defect and 2 serious defects.

	Hebei Laishan Asbestos Mine	5C Type, 5D Type Asbestos	The dust content and sand content did not meet the standard requirements, with poor packaging and a high breakage rate.

	Jiangsu Kunshan Dissolved Acetylene Factory	Dissolved Acetylene	The acetylene content and the content of hydrogen sulfide and phosphine were unqualified.

	Tianjin Shuangjie Acetylene Gas Factory	Dissolved Acetylene	The acetylene content and the content of hydrogen sulfide and phosphine were unqualified.

	Hubei Hanyang County Acetylene Gas Factory	Dissolved Acetylene	There was a serious issue of underweight products, with the regulation of 5-7 kilograms per bottle. Out of 5 bottles checked, 4 were below the standard, with the lowest being only 1.6 kilograms.

	Hunan Zhuzhou City Wujiazhu Station United Factory	Pig Feed	The national standard requires a crude protein content of greater than or equal to 12%, but the actual test result was 6.58%. The standard requires a crude fiber content of less than or equal to 8.8%, but the actual test result was 26.27%. Additionally, indicators such as ash, calcium, and phosphorus were also unqualified.
