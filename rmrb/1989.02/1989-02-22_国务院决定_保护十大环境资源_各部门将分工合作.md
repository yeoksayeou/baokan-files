The users and managers of natural resources must also take on the responsibility of protecting these resources. Based on this principle, the State Council recently decided that for ten major environmental resources, various departments will collaborate and divide responsibilities to carry out protection efforts.

These ten resources are: minerals, land, grasslands, forests, biological resources, wild animals and plants, water, marine resources, climate, and scenic areas.

The State Council has determined the following division of labor for environmental resource protection: The Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources will oversee the protection of mineral resources; the State Land Administration will oversee the protection of land resources; the Ministry of Agriculture will oversee the protection of grassland and biological resources; the Ministry of Forestry will oversee the protection of forest resources; the Ministry of Forestry and the Ministry of Agriculture will jointly oversee the protection of wild animal and plant resources; the Ministry of Water Resources will oversee the protection of water resources; the State Oceanic Administration will oversee the protection of marine resources; the State Meteorological Administration will oversee the protection of climate resources; the Ministry of Construction will oversee the protection of scenic resources. The State Environmental Protection Administration and the Ministry of Energy are coordinating departments for environmental resource protection.
