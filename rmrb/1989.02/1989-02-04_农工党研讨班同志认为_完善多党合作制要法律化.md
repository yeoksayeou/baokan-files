The Agricultural and Industrial Party Central Propaganda Department recently invited part of the central committee members, advisory and supervisory committee members, and 50 grassroots cadres in Beijing to hold a one-week seminar. The main focus was to clarify the current situation and tasks, and to improve the multi-party cooperation system under the leadership of the Communist Party.

The attendees believed that Zhao Ziyang proposed the system of multi-party cooperation under the leadership of the Communist Party, which is a fundamental institution in China's political system. This is a great trust in the democratic parties.

The attendees believed that it is completely necessary to improve the multi-party cooperation system under the leadership of the Communist Party, but it must be legalized. They suggested that in China's Constitution, the status and role of democratic parties in national political life, as well as issues related to the multi-party cooperation system, should all have clear regulations. At the same time, in the Constitution of the Communist Party of China, there should also be corresponding regulations on "adhering to the multi-party cooperation system under the leadership of the Communist Party."

They also suggested that the Communist Party should strengthen the education of its members on the united front; the Agricultural and Industrial Party itself should also conduct education on the current situation, the history of the Agricultural and Industrial Party, and the tradition of cooperating with the Communist Party. Effective measures should be taken to discover, cultivate, and select talents, improve the level of political consultation and deliberation, and play the role of the party in national political life and the four modernizations.

　　农工党研讨班同志认为
　  完善多党合作制要法律化
    本报讯  农工民主党中央宣传部最近邀集部分在京中委、咨监委及基层骨干５０人，举办了为期一周的研讨班，中心是明确当前形势与任务和完善共产党领导下的多党合作制。
    与会同志认为，赵紫阳提出共产党领导下的多党合作制度，是我国政治体制中的一项根本制度，这是对民主党派极大的信任。
    与会同志认为，要完善共产党领导下的多党合作制度是完全必要的，但必须实行法律化。他们建议，在我国宪法中对民主党派在国家政治生活中的地位、作用以及有关多党合作制等问题，都应有明确的规定。同时，在中国共产党的章程中也应有“坚持中国共产党领导下的多党合作制”的相应规定。
    他们还建议，中共应加强对党员进行统一战线方面的教育；农工党自身也要对党员进行形势教育、农工党史教育、与共产党合作共事的传统教育。要采取有效措施，发现、培养和选拔人才，提高参政议政水平，在国家政治生活和四化建设中发挥政党的职能作用。
