The Mysterious Five-Layered Lake

In the northern part of the Soviet Union's Kildin Island, there is a mysterious lake. From top to bottom, it is divided into five layers, and the water quality of each layer is different, as are the organisms living in each layer.

The first layer is pure freshwater, containing only freshwater fish and shrimp. The second layer has slightly salty water, inhabited by jellyfish and shrimp. The third layer is pure seawater, home to five or six types of marine organisms. The fourth layer of water is a deep red color, where there are no fish or shrimp, but rather a world of red microorganisms. The fifth layer (the bottom layer) is a particularly quiet world, as this layer of water contains a large amount of toxic hydrogen sulfide, making it impossible for any organisms to survive.

　　奇妙的五层湖
    苏联北部基尔金岛有一个奇妙的湖，从上到下分５层，５层湖水的水质各不相同，生活在各层的生物也不一样。
    第一层水质为纯淡水，其中只有淡水类鱼虾。第二层水略带咸味，生活着海蜇、海虾等。第三层湖水里生活着五六类海洋生物，这是一层纯海水。第四层湖水呈绛红色，这里没有鱼虾，却是红色的微生物世界。第五层（最底层）是个特别寂静的世界，因为这层湖水含有大量有毒的硫化氢，任何生物都无法生存。
