Wang Hanbin, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Director of the Legislative Affairs Commission, was commissioned by the Presidium to explain the draft "Rules of Procedure for the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China" to the Standing Committee today.

He said that the draft stipulates: (1) The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress should send the draft laws prepared for deliberation at the session to the deputies one month before the session of the National People's Congress; (2) One month before the session of the National People's Congress, the relevant departments of the State Council should report to the Financial and Economic Committee and the relevant specialized committees on the main contents of the national economic and social development plan and its implementation, and the national budget and its implementation, for preliminary examination by the Financial and Economic Committee; (3) When the State Council submits to the session of the National People's Congress the report on the national economic and social development plan and its implementation, and the report on the national budget and its implementation, it should also print and distribute the draft of the main indicators of the national economic and social development plan, the draft of the national budget revenue and expenditure statement, and the draft of the national budget implementation statement.

Wang Hanbin said that some deputies and localities have suggested that important legal bills, before being submitted to the National People's Congress for deliberation, can be published to solicit opinions widely. Therefore, the draft stipulates: The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress can publish important basic legal drafts prepared for deliberation at the session of the National People's Congress to solicit opinions widely.

Wang Hanbin said that the Constitution and the Law on the Organization of the National People's Congress stipulate that the National People's Congress can organize special committees to investigate specific issues. Some deputies and localities have suggested that the rules of procedure should stipulate the composition and working procedures of the special committees, otherwise this provision will be difficult to implement. Therefore, the draft stipulates: (1) The Presidium, three or more delegate groups, or 1/10 or more of the deputies can propose the establishment of a special committee to investigate a specific issue, which will be submitted to the plenary session of the Congress by the Presidium for decision. (2) The special committee shall be composed of a chairman, several vice-chairmen, and several members, to be nominated by the Presidium from among the deputies and approved by the Congress. The special committee can appoint experts to participate in the investigation. (3) When the special committee conducts an investigation, all relevant state organs, social organizations, and citizens have the obligation to provide it with the necessary materials truthfully. (4) The special committee shall submit an investigation report to the National People's Congress. The National People's Congress shall make corresponding resolutions based on the report of the special committee.

Wang Hanbin said that many deputies and localities have suggested that the session of the National People's Congress should reflect the spirit of political system reform and government transparency, such as distributing the records of deputies' speeches, allowing the public to freely attend as spectators, and publishing the number of votes received. Therefore, the draft, in addition to stipulating that the session of the National People's Congress is generally "held in public," also stipulates the following: 1, "During the session, the speeches of deputies at various meetings of the Congress shall be compiled into briefs and distributed to the session, and the records of speeches can be distributed by the Secretariat according to the deputies' opinions"; 2, "The plenary session of the Congress shall set up spectator seats. Spectators shall comply with the order of the meeting and shall not interfere with the normal proceedings of the meeting. Specific spectator procedures can be separately stipulated"; 3, The results of the election or appointment by the National People's Congress, "the number of votes received by the candidates shall be published"; 4, In accordance with the current practice, it is stipulated that the session of the National People's Congress "shall hold press conferences and press briefings."

　　王汉斌向人大常委作
    关于人大议事规则草案的说明
    新华社北京２月１５日电  全国人大常委会副委员长、法制工作委员会主任王汉斌今天受委员长会议的委托，向人大常委作了关于《中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会议事规则（草案）》的说明。
    他说，草案规定：（１）全国人大常委会应当在全国人大会议举行的一个月前，将准备提请会议审议的法律草案发给代表；（２）全国人大会议举行的一个月前，国务院有关主管部门应当就国民经济和社会发展计划及计划执行情况、国家预算及预算执行情况的主要内容，向财政经济委员会和有关的专门委员会汇报，由财政经济委员会进行初步审查；（３）国务院在向全国人大会议提出关于国民经济和社会发展计划及计划执行情况的报告、关于国家预算及预算执行情况的报告的同时，应将国民经济和社会发展计划主要指标（草案）、国家预算收支表（草案）和国家预算执行情况表（草案）一并印发会议。
    王汉斌说，有些代表和地方提出，重要的法律案在提请全国人大会议审议前，可以将草案公布广泛征求意见。因此，草案规定：全国人大常委会对准备提请全国人大会议审议的重要的基本法律草案，可以公布广泛征求意见。
    王汉斌说，宪法和全国人大组织法都规定，全国人大可以组织关于特定问题的调查委员会。有些代表和地方提出，议事规则应对调查委员会的组成和工作程序作出规定，否则这一规定难以执行。因此，草案规定：（１）主席团、三个以上的代表团或者１／１０以上的代表联名，可以提议组织关于特定问题的调查委员会，由主席团提交大会全体会议决定。（２）调查委员会由主任委员、副主任委员若干人和委员若干人组成，由主席团在代表中提名，大会通过。调查委员会可以聘请专家参加调查。（３）调查委员会进行调查时，一切有关的国家机关、社会团体和公民都有义务如实向它提供必要的材料。（４）调查委员会应当向全国人大提出调查报告。全国人大根据调查委员会的报告，可以作出相应的决议。
    王汉斌说，许多代表和地方提出全国人大会议应当体现政治体制改革和政务公开的精神，如印发代表发言记录，允许公众自由旁听，公布选举得票数等。因此，草案除规定全国人大会议一般“公开举行”外，作了以下规定：１、“大会会议期间，代表在大会各种会议上的发言，整理简报印发会议，并可以根据本人意见，由秘书处印发发言记录”；２、“大会全体会议设旁听席。旁听人员应当遵守会议秩序，不得妨碍会议的正常进行”，具体旁听办法可以另行规定；３、全国人大选举或者决定任命的表决结果，“候选人的得票数，应当公布”；４、根据现行做法，规定全国人大会议“举行新闻发布会、记者招待会”。
