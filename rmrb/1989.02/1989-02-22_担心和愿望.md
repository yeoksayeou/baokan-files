Title: Concerns and Aspirations

The People's Daily has opened the "People's Forum" column, providing a platform for reflecting the voices of the people, which is a good thing. However, upon closer examination, one cannot help but feel some concerns. In summary, there are four concerns and four aspirations:

First concern: The forum might become a highly abstract "People's" forum rather than a place for ordinary citizens to speak. The term "people" is used very broadly in our country. Due to various historical reasons and habitual mindsets, places labeled with the term "people" are often seen as distant and unreachable. Sometimes, one might try to approach and take a peek, but the heart feels uneasy, fearing reprimand, even though others might not actually reprimand. I hope that the "People's Forum" can change this, becoming a place where the broad masses of people are willing to speak and also willing to read.

Second concern: Avoiding sharp edges and preferring mildness. Since it is called the "People's Forum," it cannot avoid discussing issues that the broad masses of people care about most. It will discuss clothing, food, housing, transportation, education, culture, science, health, family, and gender, as well as domestic and international major events such as reform and opening up, party style, and public morals. We are currently in a "transition" period of reform and opening up. Old problems persist, and various seasonal ailments frequently take advantage of the situation. Treating serious illnesses requires strong medicine. But it is difficult to ensure that every prescription is perfectly suited. Any work is bound to have mistakes, let alone a daily forum. I hope that if problems arise, they will not be suppressed with a single blow. What should be done? "Fall down where you fall and get up where you fall." Problems that arise in the "forum" should be corrected in the "forum." Moreover, some mistakes may not necessarily be wrong. Even if they are wrong, is it better to suppress the wrong opinions, or to engage in dialogue and persuade with reason? Or to suppress them? This is something that anyone with a bit of common sense can judge.

Third concern: Backdoor "pointing" and "secret handling." It is normal to have different opinions about articles in the newspaper, and public criticism and debate can be conducted, but do not engage in "secret handling." There is often such a phenomenon. An article is published in the newspaper, someone thinks there is a problem, and then "reports it." The relevant responsible person does not conduct a detailed investigation and research, but instead orders an "investigation," making the editor anxious and the chief editor tense. The news spreads to the author's ears, and it is said that some are even frightened half to death. This is not good. Should the newspaper follow the party's line, principles, and policies? Of course, it should. Should it follow the decisions of higher-level organizations? Of course, it should. As for personal opinions, before they are approved by the organization and a decision is made, they can only be treated as personal opinions according to the party constitution. Because other leaders may agree or disagree with this opinion. For such opinions, as long as they are submitted to the "forum," the "forum" should also respect and welcome them. Welcome them to write signed articles to participate in the discussion. If this opinion is correct, and with his fame, it will be more beneficial to the discussion level of the "forum," increase readability, and strengthen the educational role. If it is not quite right, everyone can engage in a discussion, which will be helpful to the leadership, helpful to the readers, and greatly beneficial to promoting socialist democracy, strengthening the connection between the leadership and the masses, and improving the party's work and image.

Fourth concern: Turning it into a "literati forum." The People's Daily is a prestigious newspaper both domestically and internationally. Emphasizing quality is natural, and inviting "writers" to write is completely appropriate. But literati inevitably have their limitations. I hope the "forum" will look downwards, downwards again. It doesn't have to be much, but if a few articles from workers, peasants, and ordinary intellectuals can be selected and published from the submissions each month, that would be quite impressive. If this can be sustained, the benefits will be even greater.

　　担心和愿望
    官伟勋
    《人民日报》开辟了《人民论坛》专栏，多了一个反映人民呼声的园地，是件好事。但稍细一想，不由得又有些担心。概括起来，有四个担心、四个愿望：
    一担心办成高度抽象的“人民”的论坛，而非普通老百姓说话的地方。“人民”这个词在我国用的最广。但由于种种历史原因形成的习惯心态，对凡冠以“人民”这个字眼的地方，往往是可望而不可即的。有时也想凑过去探头探脑地瞟上一眼，但心里老不踏实，怕受到“呵斥”，尽管人家也不一定呵斥。愿《人民论坛》能力革此弊，办成广大人民愿意在这里说，也愿意看的园地。
    二担心“忌圭角”，“喜温吞”。既称人民论坛，就离不开广大人民最关心的问题。既会谈到衣食住行，教育文化、科学卫生，家庭男女，更会谈到改革开放党风民风等国内外大事。我们正处在改革开放“过渡”时期。旧病未去仍然缠身，各种时令之症又频频乘虚袭来。治重症须下猛药。但难求个个处方都那么对症妥贴。任何工作都难免有失误，何况天天论的论坛。但愿不要出点问题，就一棍子砸趴下。怎么办？“在哪儿跌倒在哪儿爬起来”。在“论坛”里出的问题，就在“论坛”里纠正。何况，有些错，还不一定就错。再退一步说，就是错了，对于“错误”的观点，是包起来好，还是展开对话以理服人好？还是压服好？这是稍有常识的人都不难判断的。
    三担心背地“点穴”搞“暗处理”。对报上的文章有不同意见本是正常现象，可以公开批评争论，但不要搞“暗处理”。常有这种现象。报上发一篇东西，有人认为有问题，就“告状”。有关的负责人也不详细调查研究，便下令“追查”，弄得编辑惶惶，总编紧张。风声传到作者耳中，据说还有吓个半死的。这很不好，报纸要不要服从党的路线方针政策？当然要。要不要服从上级组织的决定？当然要。至于个人的意见，在其未经组织通过做出决定之前，只能按党章规定作为个人意见对待。因为其他领导人也许同意也许不同意这一意见。对于这样的意见，只要一旦向“论坛”提出，“论坛”也应予以尊重、欢迎。欢迎他写署名文章参加讨论。如果这个意见正确，加上他的知名度，就会更有利于“论坛”讨论水平的提高，有利于提高可读性，并强化教育作用。如果不那么对，大家展开讨论，既将有助于领导，也将有助于读者，更将大大有利于发扬社会主义民主，密切领导与群众的联系，改善党的工作与形象。
    四担心办成“文人论坛”。《人民日报》是国内外有声望的大报。讲究质量理所当然，约些“笔杆子”撰文是完全应该的。但文人终究有文人的局限。愿“论坛”眼睛向下向下再向下。不要多，每月能从来稿中选出几篇确系来自工人、农民、一般知识分子的来稿刊用，也就很可观了。若能坚持下去，好处就更大了。
