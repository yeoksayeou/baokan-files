Edition: 2

The State Council Office recently issued a notice requiring stricter management of the editing and publishing of "yearbooks" and similar works.

The notice states that recently, some publishing departments, as well as some collective organizations or individuals, have arbitrarily edited and published "yearbooks," "overviews," "directories," and other publications. They have also used these publications as a pretext to demand that relevant local authorities and units provide materials and pay editing and publishing fees. It should be pointed out that such solicitation of manuscripts often bypasses the approval of the supervising departments of the contributing units, and the content is often inaccurate. As long as money is paid, the manuscript can be published. If this situation is not strictly prohibited, it will not only increase the economic burden on relevant local authorities and units but will also have a negative impact on society.

The notice emphasizes that all "yearbooks," "overviews," "directories," and other publications can only be published by formal publishing houses. Magazine offices, newspaper offices, and other non-publishing units are strictly prohibited from organizing the publication of such works. Otherwise, they will be treated as illegal publications. The editing and publishing of such publications are strictly prohibited from charging any fees to the contributing units under any name.

The notice requires all local authorities and departments to immediately conduct an inspection. Those who violate the regulations must be corrected in a practical manner, and follow-up work must be done well. The General Administration of Press and Publication and the local press and publication bureaus are responsible for supervising and implementing this work.

　　国务院办公厅发出通知
    年鉴不得擅自出版
    将作一次检查　违者必须纠正
    新华社北京２月２７日电  国务院办公厅最近发出通知，要求对编辑出版“年鉴”等工作加强管理。
    通知说，近来，一些出版部门，甚至一些集体单位或个人，擅自编辑出版“年鉴”、“概况”、“名录”等出版物，并以此为由，要求有关地方、单位提供资料并索取编辑出版费。应当指出，这类征稿往往不经供稿单位的主管部门审定，内容上多不准确，只要交钱即可刊出。这种情况，如不明令禁止，不仅增加了有关地方、单位的经济负担，而且在社会上也产生了不良的影响。
    通知强调，所有“年鉴”、“概况”、“名录”等出版物，只能由正式出版社出版，杂志社、报社及其他非出版单位一律不得组织出版。否则，以非法出版论处。编辑出版这类出版物，一律不准向供稿单位以任何名义索取任何费用。
    通知要求各地方、各部门要立即进行一次检查，对违反规定的，应切实予以纠正，并做好善后工作。这项工作由新闻出版署及各地新闻出版局负责监督执行。
