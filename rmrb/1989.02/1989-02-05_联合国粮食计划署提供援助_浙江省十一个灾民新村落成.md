The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization has provided aid for the construction of 11 new villages for disaster victims, which have recently been accepted by relevant departments in Zhejiang Province. A total of 445 disaster-affected households have moved into their new homes.

Last July and August, Zhejiang Province was hit by severe floods and typhoons. Upon learning of the situation, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization donated 10,000 tons of wheat to the disaster-stricken areas of Zhejiang without any conditions. The organization also requested that the local governments use an equivalent amount of funds to build new villages for the disaster victims.

　  浙江省十一个灾民新村落成
    据新华社杭州２月４日电  由联合国粮食计划署援助的１１个灾民新村新近通过浙江省有关部门验收。４４５户灾民迁进新居。
    去年７、８月间，浙江省连续遭受特大洪灾和台风的袭击。联合国粮食计划署闻讯后，向浙江灾区无偿提供小麦１万吨，并要求受援地区的政府以同等价值的资金为灾民建设新村。
