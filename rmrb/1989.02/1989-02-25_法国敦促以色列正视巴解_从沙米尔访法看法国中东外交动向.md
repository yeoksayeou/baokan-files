Israel's Prime Minister Shamir concluded his visit to France today. During his three-day stay in Paris, Shamir met with President Mitterrand, Prime Minister Rocard, and Foreign Minister Dumas. He also visited Assembly President Fabius, Senate President Poher, and Mayor Chirac, indicating that France attaches great importance to maintaining relations with Israel.

After reshuffling his cabinet, Shamir chose France, a country actively promoting the Middle East peace process, as his first destination for an official visit, which has drawn attention and raised expectations. During his talks and a press conference yesterday, Shamir repeatedly and stubbornly refused to convene an international Middle East conference, refused to recognize the PLO, and refused to engage in dialogue or negotiations with it. Although this visit did not yield any new views or proposals from Israel, diplomatic and media circles here still attach great importance to the meeting between French and Israeli leaders, seeing in it certain new trends in French Middle East diplomacy.

At a time when the momentum for Middle East peace is growing, France is determined to persuade Israel to change its attitude towards the PLO. On the issue of achieving Middle East peace, France and Western Europe have increasingly emphasized and supported the role of the PLO. France has elevated the status of the PLO office in Paris. Foreign Minister Dumas has met with Arafat twice. France believes that Middle East peace cannot be achieved without the PLO. To this end, France has been urging Israel to recognize the PLO. President Mitterrand told Prime Minister Shamir, "Israel should face reality, which is the reality of the Middle East situation." This indicates that France has realized that Israel's stubborn attitude has become an obstacle to Middle East peace. Recently, there were reports that President Mitterrand would meet with Arafat, and during this meeting, Mitterrand said he "has not yet made a decision on this matter." It is believed that this is a "trial," and France will continue to exert pressure on Israel in the future.

France is making efforts to increase the weight of Western Europe in the Middle East peace process. France has reached a consensus with the EC member states to form a working group of three foreign ministers to carry out extensive diplomatic activities in Arab countries. This is the largest Middle East diplomatic offensive launched by the EC since the Venice Summit a few years ago. In response to Israel's refusal to allow Western Europe to play an "important role" and its plan to let the US and the Soviet Union arrange Middle East diplomacy, President Mitterrand bluntly told Shamir, "The approach of handing over the Middle East issue completely to the US and the Soviet Union may bring more dangers to the long-term interests of Middle East countries, including Israel."

France intends to use the opportunity of the Soviet Union's return to the Middle East stage to accelerate the pace of convening a Middle East conference. During Shamir's visit to France, Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze met with Israeli Foreign Minister Arens and PLO Chairman Arafat in Cairo. The Soviet foreign minister also said that the Soviet-Israeli meeting did not overcome the existing differences. He also pointed out that the condition for the Soviet Union to restore diplomatic relations with Israel is that Israel must engage in dialogue with the PLO and no longer oppose the convening of an international conference. These two diplomatic activities indicate that the Soviet Union and France have many common points in insisting on convening an international Middle East conference. According to Western reports, on the Middle East issue, France and the Soviet Union have coordinated in the past. The report said that next month, the Soviet foreign minister and the Israeli prime minister will both visit Washington. Therefore, the Soviet and French diplomatic actions in Cairo and Paris towards Israel may have an impact on US Middle East decision-making, which is worth noting.

The meeting between the leaders of France and Israel did not achieve any substantive progress; the only decision was for both sides to maintain contact. However, through this contact, France's influence on Middle East policy has been expanded, adding color to the EC's Middle East diplomatic stage. Israel may hope for the United States, but if the United States cannot meet Israel's demands, Israel will be in a more isolated and difficult position, which will provide more opportunities for France and Western Europe. But if Israel continues to maintain its stubborn stance, the future Middle East peace process will still be difficult.

　　法国敦促以色列正视巴解
    ——从沙米尔访法看法国中东外交动向
    本报记者  张启华
    以色列总理沙米尔今天结束对法国访问。在巴黎三天时间，沙米尔总理会见了密特朗总统、罗卡尔总理、迪马外长，同时拜会了法比尤斯议长、波埃尔议长和希拉克市长，说明法国方面很重视保持同以色列关系。
    沙米尔重组政府后，首次出访就选择了积极推动中东和平进程的法国，引起人们的关注和期望。沙米尔在会谈中，以及昨天他举行的记者招待会上，一再顽固地拒绝召开中东国际和会，拒绝承认巴解组织，拒绝同它对话和谈判。尽管这次访问的结果，“看不到以色列拿出新的观点和建议”，但此间外交、舆论界仍十分重视法以领导人会晤，人们由此看到法国中东外交的某些新动向。
    在中东和平势头日趋活跃之际，法国决心劝说以色列改变对巴解组织的态度。在实现中东和平问题上，近来法国和西欧日益重视、支持巴解组织的作用。法国已提高巴解办事处在巴黎的地位。迪马外长两次会见了阿拉法特。法国认为，中东和平不能缺少巴解一方。为此，法国竭力敦促以色列承认巴解。密特朗总统对沙米尔总理说，“以色列应该正视现实，这是中东形势发展的现实。”这表明，法国已经意识到，以色列顽固的态度，已成为中东和平的障碍。不久前有消息说，密特朗总统将会见阿拉法特，在这次会晤中，密特朗称他“一直没有就此做出决定”。人们认为，这是一种“试探”，法国今后还会继续对以色列施加压力。
    法国尽力加重西欧在中东和平进程中的份量。法国已同欧共体成员国取得一致决定由三外长组成的工作班子在阿拉伯国家已广泛开展外交活动，这是自几年前威尼斯会议以来欧共体发动的最大一次中东外交攻势。针对以色列不给西欧扮演“重要角色”，让美苏安排中东外交的构想，密特朗总统直截了当地对沙米尔说，“把中东问题完全交给美苏的办法，可能给中东国家，包括以色列的长远利益带来更多的危险。”
    法国有意借助苏联重返中东舞台之机，加快促成中东和会的步伐。在沙米尔总理访法同时，苏外长谢瓦尔德纳泽在开罗会见了以色列外长阿伦斯、巴解主席阿拉法特。苏外长也称，苏以会晤没有克服存在的分歧。他还指出，苏联同以色列恢复外交关系的条件是，以色列要同巴解对话，不再反对召开国际和会。这两项外交活动表明，苏联同法国在坚持召开中东国际和会上有许多共同之处。据西方消息透露，在中东问题上，法苏过去曾经作过协调。报道说，下个月，苏联外长和以色列总理都要造访华盛顿。因此，苏联、法国在开罗、巴黎对以色列的外交行动，究竟对美国的中东决策产生什么影响，这是值得注意的。
    法国、以色列两国领导人的会晤没有获得任何实质性的进展；唯一的决定是双方继续保持联系。但通过这次接触，扩大了法国中东政策的影响，给欧共体的中东外交舞台增添了色彩。以色列可能寄希望于美国，如果美国不能满足以色列要求的话，以色列将处于更加孤立、困难的境地，而这将给法国、西欧提供更多机会。但以色列如继续坚持顽固立场，未来的中东和平进程仍将是艰难的。
