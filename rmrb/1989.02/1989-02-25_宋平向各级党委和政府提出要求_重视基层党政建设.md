Song Ping Urges Attention to Grassroots Party and Government Construction

		Song Ping, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and head of the Organization Department, today stressed the importance of grassroots party and government construction at a meeting with grassroots cadres from urban districts, townships, and villages in Beijing.

		Song Ping pointed out that townships, district offices, village committees, and residents' committees are the foundation of our country's political power. Grassroots party organizations are the cells that sustain the life, development, and vitality of the Party.

		China has 69,842 townships, 5,680 district offices, 845,025 village committees, and 86,824 residents' committees.

		On behalf of the CPC Central Committee, Song Ping extended warm greetings to the grassroots cadres attending the meeting and, through them, to all grassroots cadres across the country.

		Song Ping emphasized that grassroots party organizations and grassroots political power bear the historical responsibility of implementing the policies and laws of the Party and the state, leading the broad masses of the people in building socialist modernization, and serving as a bridge and bond between the Party and the state and the masses.

		Song Ping stressed that grassroots cadres face heavy tasks, numerous issues, poor conditions, and arduous work. All levels of Party committees and governments must understand, care for, and support them. They should frequently listen to their opinions and address the problems they encounter in their work and lives. They should also commend, through various means, the advanced grassroots units and outstanding grassroots cadres.

		Song Ping pointed out that the construction of grassroots party organizations is an important task for Party committees and organization departments, and the construction of grassroots political power is an important task for civil affairs departments. All levels of Party organizations and civil affairs departments should be proactive and steady in carrying out this work.

		Li Ximin, Peng Chong, Wang Fang, and Chen Xitong also spoke at the meeting. The Minister of Civil Affairs, Cui Naifu, presided over the meeting.
