A heavy snowfall had covered the mountains and villages of Gleng County in Shanxi Province. During this season, villagers often gather around the fire to chat and discuss various topics. However, due to disagreements on certain issues, these gatherings often end up with complaints.

On the morning of January 24, County Party Secretary Li Guixi attended a villagers' meeting in Anyao Village, Anyao Town. Below is a summary of the main points discussed between the secretary and the farmers.

Hot Topic: Price Issues

Zhang Delin (male, 54 years old): We ordinary people are most concerned about price issues. Everyone says that the state buys our goods at low prices, but we have to buy state goods at high prices. We don't understand. Production materials keep increasing in price, why can't grain prices be raised?

Li Guixi: Over the past few years, the price increase of production materials has indeed been significant. Although grain prices have also been raised, the increase has been minimal, which is a fact. To control the price increase of production materials, the state has implemented a monopoly policy for important materials such as fertilizers, pesticides, and plastic sheets to prevent middlemen from profiteering. This policy is a decision made by the central government and the State Council, so please rest assured. Why can't grain prices be significantly increased? Because a large increase in grain prices may lead to a chain reaction of price increases, ultimately hurting the farmers. Therefore, the state procurement price for grain must remain stable and cannot be raised arbitrarily.

(Editor's note: It can also be explained that before wages are reformed, a significant increase in grain prices would be unaffordable for urban residents, requiring state financial subsidies. Currently, the state's finances are strained, so we hope that our farmer brothers can understand the state's difficulties and take on more responsibilities for the greater good.

In fact, the grain prices mentioned refer to the portion procured by the state, not including the portion sold on the market. The price of the freely sold portion is constantly changing, and the current price is already quite high. Overall, grain prices have increased significantly.

In the long term, the price of grain and agricultural products must be aligned with the overall economic development. However, we are not there yet and cannot significantly increase grain prices.

Xu Guanghui (male, 46 years old): Here, most of our land is irrigated, allowing for two crops per year. For wheat, each mu requires 50 kilograms of nitrogen fertilizer and 25 kilograms of urea, at least three waterings, and another crop of corn with similar inputs, totaling about 100 yuan per mu. Additionally, we have to pay land tax and share the salaries of village teachers, village cadres, military subsidies, and village public welfare funds. Our village has developed enterprises, but in other villages, farmers have no other income, and with grain prices only slightly adjusted, how can we bear it?

Li Guixi: Farmers' burdens are indeed too heavy. According to the county's agricultural and industrial department, the average annual burden per farmer is 43 yuan. To stop unreasonable levies, the county issued a document in 1985, which initially solved the problem well. However, in recent years, due to the county leadership, especially my laxity as the secretary, the problem has resurfaced. We have recently taken the following measures: first, we are focusing on developing township and village collective enterprises to implement the "one village, one industry" economic development strategy; second, we have established a "fixed item quota" system for collective levies, strictly prohibiting all unreasonable levies, and farmers can refuse to pay if the regulations are violated; third, we are strictly implementing rural financial management to stop all unreasonable expenditures by the village committee; fourth, we are streamlining village cadres. This should help.

Miao Guifang (female, 44 years old, seeing a few people asking questions, stood up shyly): We don't mind if the price of famous cigarettes and alcohol is raised, but why is the price of matches, which every household uses, also so high? A box of matches costs 8 fen or 1 jiao, and in the future, it might be sold by the stick!

Li Guixi: According to our province's regulations, the price of matches per box is increased to 4 fen, mainly because the price of wood has more than doubled. The price of 8 fen or 1 jiao per box is a speculative price, not the state's official price.

Miao Guifang: Are the matches on the market sold by state stores? This is a small matter, but can you manage it? Because although matches are small, every household needs them!

(Editor's note: This farmer's words are good. Matches are small, but they affect the stability of people's hearts. Leaders should not ignore them because they are small.)

Li Guixi: I will dispatch someone to investigate immediately and ensure the stability of match prices to meet everyone's needs. (Audience applauds)

Wang Jijun (male, 59 years old): We can't afford state fertilizers, so can we not sell grain to the state?

Li Guixi: That's not possible. The fertilizer issue has been mentioned earlier. The state and the county have taken measures to stabilize prices and make fertilizers affordable. Grain must still be sold to the state according to the contract. With so many urban residents, if the procurement task is not completed, it will cause chaos! Think about it, those workers, cadres, students, and military personnel, can you let them all buy high-priced grain from the market? Old Wang, isn't that right?

Wang Jijun: Haha, I was just saying, we farmers still have to contribute our patriotic grain.

(Editor's note: It can be seen that farmers have at least this basic awareness.)

Yang Jianzhu (male, 60 years old, transportation specialist): I am a transportation specialist. Now, state-subsidized gasoline and diesel are not available, but high-priced gasoline and diesel are sold on the roadside, even more expensive than edible oil. I dare not start my car. Can you investigate this?

Li Guixi: The supply and demand imbalance for oil has always been prominent. In our county, the oil supply quota is based on the 1982 figure. However, in recent years, the number of vehicles has increased rapidly. At that time, there were only 120 gasoline-powered vehicles in the entire county, now there are 460; there were 40 diesel-powered vehicles, now there are 200, so the demand cannot be met. Why are there high-priced oils on the roadside? This is due to the chaos in the circulation sector. Recently, there has been a directive from above to shut down all private gas stations. I have instructed the Industrial and Commercial Bureau to revoke the business licenses of 4 private gas stations and investigate the source of their oil. Some say that the petroleum department is under direct leadership, and the county cannot manage it, but they are within our county's jurisdiction, and as long as they violate the law, I will investigate them regardless of any rules or regulations.

Audience: Good, good, the county should have done this long ago!

Fan Haiming (male, 48 years old): We farmers have to pay in cash when buying state goods, but we hear that in many places, farmers who sell grain and cotton to the grain depot and cotton depot receive IOUs. Why is this?

Li Guixi: This phenomenon exists in many places. The main reason is that banks and procurement units have made mistakes in their fund arrangements. However, issuing IOUs is not about not paying farmers; it is just a temporary deferral until funds are available for repayment. Of course, this is an irresponsible approach to farmers and will dampen their enthusiasm. In our county, due to early arrangements by the Agricultural Bank, this situation has not occurred. As long as attention is paid, it can be avoided, and everyone does not need to worry.

Material Supply Needs Improvement

Zhao Zhantou: The state's mandatory grain procurement is a hard task, but fertilizers, pesticides, and plastic sheets cannot meet the supply. Why is this?

Li Guixi: What do you think?

Zhao Zhantou (smiling): It's the farmers who are suffering!

(Editor's note: These words indeed reflect some reality.)

Li Guixi: It's not that the farmers are suffering,

(Editor's note: Here, it might be better to first acknowledge that there are indeed places where "farmers are suffering," and then provide some explanations, clarifying the various reasons.)

but because the state's current production capacity is low. Now, the state is trying to increase production in these areas and also appropriately import to ensure that the supply of fertilizers, pesticides, and plastic sheets is improved. For example, the State Chemical Industry Department is planning to renovate a batch of small fertilizer plants in the next few years and build some large and medium-sized fertilizer plants. In the future, the variety, quantity, and quality of fertilizers will all change.

Audience (in unison): We have been waiting for this day, and we cannot let farmers continue to struggle with farming.

Zheng Shaojun (male, 60 years old): It's strange, why is salt also in short supply? We often buy it at a high price but still can't get it. What's going on?

Li Guixi (smiling): The shortage of salt is not because the state supply of salt is insufficient. Why is it tight? During the panic buying last year, some people hoarded a large amount of salt. Another reason is that some enterprises that use salt as a raw material cannot buy industrial salt, so they use food salt as a substitute, causing a supply shortage. Don't worry, our county has taken measures to ensure the supply of salt.

(Editor's note: The main reason is the latter.)

Why Agriculture Is Important Again

Fan Guozhang (male, 39 years old, Party branch secretary): In the past two years, agriculture was not emphasized much. Recently, the central government held a rural work conference. Why is agriculture important again?

Li Guixi: After 1985, most rural areas solved the problem of basic sustenance, and some places even faced the problem of "difficulty in selling grain." Some departments and local officials thought that the agricultural problem had been solved, leading to a neglect of agriculture. Coupled with natural disasters, this resulted in China's grain production stagnating for several consecutive years. Taking our county as an example, in 1984, the total grain production exceeded 100 million kilograms, with wheat production alone reaching 80 million kilograms. In this situation, we focused on developing industry, township enterprises, and economic crops, that is, projects that bring in quick money, and did not pay much attention to agriculture, resulting in a decrease in grain production from 1986 onwards. By 1988, the county's annual grain production was only equivalent to the wheat production of one season in 1984. I think many places in the country are similar to our county. If this situation is not reversed and agriculture, the foundation, is further weakened, it will inevitably affect the overall economy of the country. If we are worried about the food problem again, how can we talk about economic development? Therefore, the central government held a rural work conference before the New Year, emphasizing agriculture, especially the grain issue, and proposing a series of new measures for developing agriculture in the new situation. This is very timely and necessary.

Xu Guanghui (male, 46 years old): We have read the reports on the central government's rural work conference and the speeches by the central leaders, and we think they are all good. However, we are concerned about the implementation.

(Editor's note: Farmers' concerns are valid. Strengthening agriculture is not just about empty slogans. How many of the specific measures determined by the central government have been implemented? Regular checks should be conducted to ensure implementation.)

Li Guixi: What are you all concerned about?

Audience: We are concerned about everything!

Li Tinglong (male, 41 years old): We are concerned that the methods mentioned by the central government are like cakes painted on the wall and cannot be realized. For example, the central government says to further develop agriculture, relying on policy, science, and investment. However, in our county, how can we rely on science? Without money, how can we invest?

Li Guixi: Relying on policy is because the correctness of the policy ensures the continuous development of agriculture, which everyone has experienced. As for how to rely on science, this was specially studied at the recent county "three cadres" meeting. To make science and technology truly popular among farmers, the county has decided to: first, establish a scientific and technological leadership system, with a deputy county magistrate for science and technology at the county level, and a deputy township magistrate for science and technology at the township level. In the future, each village committee will also have a deputy director who loves agricultural science and technology and has relevant knowledge and abilities. Second, establish a seed breeding system, with 1,000 households initially determined for seed breeding. Third, vigorously promote practical technologies, and currently, we are establishing four dissemination networks for grain, cotton, livestock, and processing industries.

The lack of investment is indeed a difficult problem. You feel difficult, and the county also feels difficult because the state's financial resources are insufficient. After the central government's rural work conference, I attended a meeting in the province, and the provincial leaders called in the financial secretary and bank president, who are in charge of money, and after calculating and squeezing, they could only squeeze out 50 million yuan. You can imagine, with more than 110 counties in the province, including more than 30 poverty-stricken counties, and our county not being one of them, how much of this money can our county get? Even if it is evenly distributed, 50 million yuan for the entire province's rural population means less than 2 yuan per person, what can be done with that? Our county has squeezed out 500,000 yuan from other funds, but drilling a well costs more than 400,000 yuan. My point is that relying solely on the state for investment in agriculture is not enough! Farmers themselves must also contribute; first, through collective funding; second, township and village enterprises can supplement agriculture; third, tap the potential of existing water conservancy facilities; fourth, accumulate more farmyard manure; fifth, work harder and invest more labor in the land to improve the soil; sixth, we should also dig into our own resources. In short, we cannot just wait. If we keep waiting and relying, we might end up as beggars! You all agree, right?

Li Tinglong (laughs): That's right, that's right!

The audience laughed.

During the meeting, the audience also discussed many views and doubts about rural social order and political thought work. Li Guixi frankly provided answers.

Yang Huihe (male, 26 years old): Then, finally, I would like to ask Secretary Li, are you afraid of bad people? (Laughter)

Li Guixi: Saying I'm not afraid would be a lie. Although I am a county party secretary, I am also an ordinary person. How can I not be afraid? For example, if an official makes a mistake and is punished, some may even be expelled from their position, and they might hold a grudge. Therefore, sometimes I am a bit afraid. But I think, one good person can suppress a hundred evil ones. What is there to be afraid of? He is a person, and you are also a person. Besides, he is doing something that cannot be seen in the light. People often say, thieves fear noise and ghosts fear light. Bad people doing bad things are themselves cowardly. You stand tall, and he will be weak. Therefore, we must dare to fight against bad people. Now, I am no longer afraid, and my courage is very great! (Applause)

The dialogue lasted for 4 hours. The farmers asked all their questions and said all they wanted to say. They understood the reasons and knew the truth, although the answers were not entirely satisfying, but their mood was much better. An old man named Wang Mingjun happily said: "In the past, we only heard rumors and did not understand the truth of the state. Now, we understand. We farmers should also understand the state's difficulties and not always complain endlessly!"

(Editor's note: Farmers are so reasonable! The more they are like this, the more the government should think about the farmers' difficulties, tell the farmers the truth, and do practical things for the farmers.)

　　“给咱农民说说实情”
    ——记绛县县委书记李桂喜与农民的一次对话
    新华社记者  杨玉良
    一场大雪，把山西省绛县的山川、村庄盖了个严实。这样的季节，乡亲们喜欢聚在一起围着火炉议东论西。但由于对一些事争论不清，便常使这种聚会说着说着就说出不少怨气。
    １月２４日这天上午，县委书记李桂喜参加了安峪镇安峪村的一次村民聚会。下面摘录的是这位书记同农民聊天的主要内容。
    　　　　热点：物价问题
    张德林（男、５４岁）：我们老百姓对物价问题最关心，大伙到一起就说，国家买我们的东西都是低价，我们买国家的东西又都是高价。我们想不通。生产资料一直涨，为啥粮食就不能再提一提呢？
    李桂喜：这几年，生产资料涨价幅度确实比较大。粮食虽然也提了价，但幅度不大，这是事实。为了限制生产资料价格再涨，国家对重要的生产资料，如化肥、农药、农膜等，实行了专营，以防止中间商倒买倒卖，从中渔利。实行专营，是中央和国务院下了决心的，这点，请大家放心。为什么对粮食价格只能采取微调，不能大提，今年每公斤只提高了几分钱呢？因为粮食价格大幅度上升，可能引起轮番涨价，最后吃亏的还是农民。所以，国家定购粮价格要稳定，不能随随便便就提的。
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　  　（编者按：还可以讲明，在工资还没有改革之前，粮价大幅度上升，城镇居民负担不起，要国家财政补贴，而目前国家财政方面有困难，希望农民兄弟体谅国家的难处，为大局多担当点。
   其实，大家说的粮价，指国家定购的那部分，不包括在市场上出售的，而自由出售的那部分的价格是不断变动的，现在的价格就很高，拉到一起看，粮食价格还是提高了不少。
    从长远看，粮食及农产品价格的高低，最终要同整个经济的发展状况相适应，但眼下我们还不行，还不能大幅度提高粮价。
    徐光辉（男、４６岁）：我们这里大都是水地，一年两茬庄稼，小麦一茬每亩得５０公斤氮肥、２５公斤尿素，至少得浇三次水，再种一茬玉米，投入也大体一样，每亩投入得１００元左右，还要交土地税，分摊民办教师、村干部的工资、现役军人的补助、村里的公益事业费等，我们村办企业发达，要在别的村，农民没有什么其它收入，粮价又只能微调，怎么受得了？
    李桂喜：农民的负担确实过重。据县农工部调查，农民年负担平均每人４３元。为了制止不合理的摊派，１９８５年，县里曾专门发过文件，当时对这个问题解决得比较好。但是，近年来，因为县领导，特别是我这个书记放松了，所以，问题又严重起来。我们最近进行了研究，已经采取了这样几条措施：一是花大气力抓好乡办、村办集体企业，把“一村一业”的发展经济的战略措施落到实处；二是制定了集体提留“定项限额”制度，严禁一切不合理的摊派，违背规定的，农民可以拒交；三是严格农村财务制度，制止村委会一切不合理开支；四是精简村干部。这样可能会好些。
    苗桂芳（女、４４岁，看到几个人提问了，也怯生生地站起来）：名烟名酒价格提得再高咱也没意见，可家家户户用的火柴为啥价也涨得这么高？一盒火柴就８分钱、一角钱，再过一段时间，可能要数根根卖了！
    李桂喜：按咱省的规定火柴每盒涨到４分钱，这主要是因为木材价涨了１倍多。每盒８分、一角，那是胡倒的价儿，不是国家牌价。
    苗桂芳：那些市场上的火柴是不是从国家商店倒出来的？这虽是小事，你能不能管一管？因为火柴虽小，千家万户都得用呀！
    （编者按：这位农民说得好。火柴虽小，但关系人心的稳定。作领导的不可因其小而忽略不管。）
    李桂喜：我回去就派人调查，一定稳住火柴价格，保证大家的需要。（群众鼓掌）
    王基俊（男、５９岁）：我们买不起国家的化肥，能不能也不卖给国家粮食？
    李桂喜：这可不行。化肥问题，前面我说了，国家和县里都采取了办法，尽力稳定价格，让大家买得起。粮食还得按合同卖给国家，城市人口那么多，都不完成定购任务，就要出乱子了！大家想想，那些工人、干部、学生、解放军指战员，难道你能让他们都到市场上去买高价粮吃吗？老王，你说是不是？
    王基俊：嘿嘿，不过是说说，咱农民还是得交爱国粮的。
    （编者按：可以看出，农民的这点起码的觉悟还是有的。）
    杨建株（男、６０岁，运输专业户）：我是个运输专业户，现在国家的平价汽油、柴油买不到，可路边却有人卖高价汽油、柴油，那价儿比人吃的油还贵，我的汽车都不敢发动了。你能不能查一查？
    李桂喜：油的供求矛盾一直比较突出。拿咱县来说，供油指标是１９８２年的基数。可这几年车辆增加太猛。那时全县用汽油的车才１２０部，现在４６０部；柴油车那时是４０部，现在２００部，所以难以满足需要。为什么路边又有高价的呢？这是流通领域混乱造成的。最近，上边有个精神，对私人加油站一律取缔。我已通知工商局派人吊销４家私人加油站的营业执照，并调查其油的来源。有人说，石油部门是直线领导，县里管不上，但他们在我们县的境界内，只要违法，我是照查不误！管他什么条条不条条。
    群众：好、好，县里早就应该这样干了！
    范海明（男、４８岁）：我们农民买国家的商品得交现金，可我们听到，在许多地方，农民卖了粮食、棉花，粮站、棉站却给打白条。这是为啥？
    李桂喜：这种现象在不少地方有。主要是因为银行和收购单位在资金安排上出了毛病。但打白条，并不是不给农民钱，只是先欠着，等有了资金再偿还。当然，这是一种对农民不负责任的做法，会挫伤农民的积极性。咱县，由于农业银行早有安排，没有出现这种情况。只要注意，是可以避免的，大家不必担心。
    　　　　物资供应应改善
    赵占虎：国家让农民交的定购粮是硬任务，可化肥、农药、农膜等都不能满足供应，这是为什么？
    李桂喜：你说呢？
    赵占虎（笑着）：亏我们农民哩！
    （编者按：这话确也道出了几分实情。）
    李桂喜：不是亏农民，
    （编者按：这里倒不妨先承认，确有“亏农民”的地方，再作些解释，说明其中种种原因。）
    而是因为国家目前的生产能力不高。现在国家正在设法增加这几方面的产量，同时，也要适当进口，争取尽可能把化肥、农药、农膜等的供应搞得好些。以化肥来说，国家化工部就正在筹划，要在近几年内改造一批小化肥厂，还要建一些大中型化肥厂。今后，化肥的品种、数量、质量都会有改变的。
    群众（纷纷地）：就盼这一天哩，可不能让我们农民在种庄稼上再为难了。
    郑少俊（男、６０岁）：也真怪，食盐咋也紧张了呢？我们常常出高价也买不到，到底是咋弄的么？
    李桂喜（笑着）：食盐短缺，并不是国家供应的食盐少了。为什么紧张？去年刮抢购风时，一些人把食盐大量囤积起来了。还有一个原因是，一些用盐作原料的企业因买不到工业用盐，就用食盐代替，引起了供应紧张。别怕，咱县已采取了措施，一定保证食盐供应。
    （编者按：主要是后一种原因。）
    　　　　为啥又重视农业
    范国璋（男、３９岁，党支部书记）：前两年，农业叫得不怎么响。最近，中央又召开了农村工作会议，为啥又重视起农业来了？
    李桂喜：１９８５年以后，大部分农村解决了温饱问题，一些地方还出现了“卖粮难”的现象，一些部门和地方的同志就以为农业问题已经解决了，于是，就发生了忽视农业的倾向，加上自然灾害，就造成我国粮食生产连续几年徘徊。以咱县为例，１９８４年，粮食总产量突破了１亿公斤，仅小麦产量就８０００万公斤。在这种情况下，我们就侧重了抓工业，抓乡镇企业，抓经济作物，就是说抓来钱快的项目，不太重视农业了，结果造成了从１９８６年后粮食的减产，到１９８８年，全县全年的粮食总产量，只相当１９８４年小麦一季的产量。我想，全国许多地方，也同咱县一样。如果不扭转这种情况，继续削弱农业这个基础，势必影响我国经济的全局。大家再为吃饭问题着急，还谈什么发展经济？因此，中央在年前召开了农村工作会议，对农业、特别是对粮食问题加以再强调，提出在新的形势下，发展农业的一系列新的措施，就是十分及时的，也是十分必要的。
    徐光辉（男、４６岁）：报上登的中央农村工作会议的报道，我们都看了，中央首长的讲话我们也看了，觉得讲得都很好，可就是担心落实不了。
    （编者按：农民担心得有道理。加强农业，不是光空喊就能奏效的。中央确定的具体措施，到底落实了多少？应当经常检查，确保落到实处。）
    李桂喜：都担心些啥？
    群众：条条都担心哩！
    李廷龙（男、４１岁）：我们担心中央说的那些办法，就像墙上画的烧饼，实现不了。比如说，中央说进一步发展农业，一靠政策，二靠科学，三靠投入，可在咱县科学咋个靠法，投入没钱咋办？
    李桂喜：靠政策，因为政策的正确，才能保证农业的不断发展，这点，大家都有切身体会。至于如何靠科学，这次全县“三干”会，专门作了研究。为了使科技真正普及到农民，县里决定，一是建立科技领导体系，县上配备了一名科技副县长，乡里也配备一名科技副乡长，村里今后也要配一名热爱农业科学技术、有这方面知识和才干的村委会副主任。二是建立种子繁育体系，现已初步确定了１０００个良种繁育户。三是大力推广实用技术，现在正着手建立粮棉、畜牧、山楂、加工业４个传授网。
    投入没钱，确实是个难题。你们感到难，县上也感到难，因为国家目前财力不足。这次中央农村工作会后，我在省里开会，省领导把财政厅长、银行行长等管钱的人叫来，算来算去，挤来挤去，也只挤出来５０００万元。你们想想，全省１１０多个县，其中３０多个贫困县，咱县又不在内，这点钱分到咱县能有几个？就说平均分，５０００万元，全省农村人口每人平均不到２元，能干啥？咱县把其他方面的款项卡了又卡，也只拿出５０万元，而打一眼机井就得４万多。我的意思是说，向农业投入光靠国家是不行的！还得靠咱农民自己，一是集资；二是乡办、村办企业补补农；三是挖掘现有水利设施的潜力；四是大积农家肥；五是多流点汗，在土地上多投些工，改造土壤；六是咱们自己再抖抖家底。总之，不能干等着。一个劲死等、死靠，说不定会把咱等成个叫花子呢！你们说，是不是这个理？
    李廷龙（笑起来）：是这个理，是这个理！
    群众都笑了起来。
    会上，群众还就农村社会治安、政治思想工作等问题谈了不少看法和疑虑。李桂喜坦率地作了解答。
    杨会河（男、２６岁）：那么，最后，我请问李书记，你见到坏人怕不怕？（哄堂大笑）
    李桂喜：说不怕，那是假话。我虽然是个县委书记，但也是个普普通通的人呀，怎么能不怕呢？比如说，一个干部犯了错误，受了处分，有的甚至被开除了公职，说不定就耿耿于怀，因此，有时我也是有点怕的。但我想，一正压百邪，怕什么？他是个人，你也是个人，何况他干的事是见不得人的哩。人常说，贼怕有声鬼怕见亮，坏人干坏事，本身就心虚。你壮他就软。因此，要敢于同坏人作斗争。现在，我变得不怕了，胆子大得很哩！（热烈鼓掌）
    对话一直进行了４个小时。农民想问的都问了，想说的话也说了，明白了道理，知道了实情，尽管解答并不让人全满意，但心情舒畅多了。一位叫王明俊的老汉高兴地说：“过去，咱听到的都是小道消息，对国家的实情不了解。这下，咱明白了，咱农民也该体谅体谅国家，不能老是没完没了地埋怨啦！”
    （编者按：农民多么通情达理啊！越是这样，政府越应当多想想农民的难处，向农民说实情，为农民办实事。）
