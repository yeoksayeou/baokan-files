	“Strengthening anti-corruption efforts, welcoming media supervision,” such statements, speeches, and articles are now quite common. If these words are truly put into action, not only will colleagues in the news industry be greatly encouraged, but many ordinary people will also be overjoyed.

	However, in reality, people fall into two categories. One type genuinely welcomes media supervision. They welcome it when the media exposes others' shortcomings, they welcome it when it exposes their subordinates' shortcomings, and they especially welcome it when it exposes their own shortcomings. They take criticism as a joy and strive to improve. The other type only welcomes media supervision in words. They welcome it when the media exposes others' shortcomings, but they become furious when it exposes their subordinates' shortcomings, and they become enraged when it exposes their own shortcomings. They take criticism as an insult and react violently. Some even seize on minor issues to retaliate against the news outlets that exposed them, causing endless trouble. Calling such people “welcoming media supervision like Leyou” might still be an overestimation.

	News reports must be truthful, and media supervision must guard against inaccuracies. News professionals, of course, cannot overlook this. However, if we demand that every criticism be 100%, 0.1%, or 0.01% accurate, it would be equivalent to canceling criticism and rejecting supervision.

	During the transition from the old to the new system, many regulations and institutions need to be improved and perfected. The task of anti-corruption efforts is particularly arduous, and the role of media supervision should be even more valued. Leaders like Liu Suinian, the Minister of the Ministry of Materials, sincerely welcome and support media supervision, setting a good example. Those who harbor a Leyou attitude towards media supervision should learn from them.

### “欢迎监督”，莫做叶公

　　“欢迎监督”，莫做叶公
     潇雨
    “加强廉政建设，欢迎舆论监督”，这样的表态，这样的讲话，这样的文章，如今并不鲜见。真能做到的话，不唯新闻单位的同仁倍受鼓舞，众多的百姓也会额手称庆。
    然而考诸实际，却人分两种。一种人是真欢迎舆论监督，报刊揭别人的短他欢迎，揭他下属的短他也欢迎，揭他本人的短他更欢迎。他们是闻过则喜，闻过则改。另一种人却只是口头上欢迎舆论监督，报刊揭别人的短他欢迎，揭他下属的短他就勃然变色，揭他本人的短他更要暴跳如雷。他们是闻过则怒，闻过则跳。有的人甚至抓点枝节问题向揭短的新闻单位兴师问罪，纠缠不休。说这种人是欢迎舆论监督的叶公，恐怕还高估了他们。
    新闻报道必须真实，舆论监督力戒失实，新闻界同仁当然不可忽略。但是如果要求任何批评都百分之百、千分之千、万分之万的准确，也就无异于取消批评、拒绝监督。
    在新旧体制转换时期，很多规章制度有待完善、有待健全，廉政建设的任务格外艰巨，舆论监督的作用更应重视。物资部部长柳随年等领导干部热诚欢迎、支持舆论监督，做出了好样子，那些对舆论监督怀有叶公心态的同志应当好好向他们学学。
