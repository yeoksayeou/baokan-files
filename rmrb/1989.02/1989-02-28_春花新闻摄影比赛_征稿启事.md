Spring Blossom News Photography Competition
Call for Entries

News photographs, with their vivid and believable images, reflect social reality and report on new developments, situations, and problems in the reform process. This form of news has increasingly gained the favor of a wide range of readers. To strengthen the dissemination of this visual news, and to encourage more photographers to capture more and better news photographs, our newspaper, in collaboration with the Suzhou Spring Blossom Vacuum Cleaner Factory in Jiangsu Province, will hold a news photography competition from March 1 to August 31.

The content and themes of the entries are not restricted, but they must have news value, be true to life, vivid, have a sense of being on the scene, and have a breath of life. The explanatory text should be detailed and concise.

Entries should be eight-inch black-and-white photographs, with the time and place of shooting clearly marked. Please send two copies to the Photography Department of the People's Daily in Beijing, clearly marking "News Photography Competition" on the envelope and affixing sufficient postage.

After screening, selected entries will be published in our newspaper. At the end of the competition, a panel of judges will select one first prize, three second prizes, ten third prizes, and fifty excellent prizes from the entries, and will award certificates and prize money accordingly.

We welcome everyone to participate enthusiastically and contribute their best works to the broad readership.
