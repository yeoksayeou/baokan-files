The National People's Congress Education, Science, Culture, and Health Committee and the State Education Commission inspected the implementation of the Compulsory Education Law in Zhejiang, Heilongjiang, and Gansu provinces, finding a mix of successes and challenges.

Today, the National People's Congress Education, Science, Culture, and Health Committee held an expanded meeting at the Great Hall of the People to hear reports on the inspection of the implementation of the Compulsory Education Law in Zhejiang, Heilongjiang, and Gansu provinces. The meeting also discussed issues related to the universalization of compulsory education.

Last September, the National People's Congress Education, Science, Culture, and Health Committee and the State Education Commission jointly organized inspection teams to check the implementation of the Compulsory Education Law in Zhejiang, Heilongjiang, and Gansu provinces. The inspections revealed that the enforcement of the Compulsory Education Law has prompted local party and government leaders to pay more attention to education, particularly to basic education. It has also driven the development of different levels of education in various regions. Zhejiang, a coastal province, has implemented nine years of compulsory education in all cities and 538 townships (approximately 9.3 million people), while other areas are implementing elementary compulsory education. Gansu, a relatively underdeveloped province, saw the enrollment rate of school-age children in primary education rise from 83.1% in 1983 to 92.2% in 1987. Thirty-five counties have basically achieved universal primary education, accounting for 40% of the total counties in the province. The implementation of the Compulsory Education Law has motivated local governments and the public to be more proactive in education, leading to improvements in educational conditions in many places. It has also promoted a shift in the educational philosophy, especially in rural areas, towards serving local economic and social development.

The joint inspection team noted that while there have been achievements, there are also serious challenges and problems that need to be addressed:

Some leaders do not fully recognize the importance of education, particularly the urgency of improving the quality of the workforce. The inspections found that while high-end hotels are being built, many primary and secondary schools still operate in two shifts and have dilapidated buildings.

Dropout rates among primary and secondary school students are relatively high. According to statistics from Gansu province, the dropout rate for primary school students in the 1987-1988 academic year was 4.92%, an increase of 0.2% from the previous year. In Zhejiang province, the dropout rate for junior high school students was 6.8% in 1985 and 7.3% in 1987. In Heilongjiang province, the dropout rate for junior high school students reached 7.8% in 1987.

Insufficient educational funding is a widespread issue. The inspections found that the provision in the Compulsory Education Law, which stipulates that the growth of educational funding must exceed the growth of general fiscal revenue, has not been implemented in most places. The proportion of educational funding in local fiscal expenditures has been decreasing. Additionally, due to the rapid increase in personnel expenses, the proportion of public funds has been sharply declining, coupled with the factor of price increases, resulting in a negative growth in public funds. Due to funding shortages, the conditions for primary and secondary schools remain poor. Many places provide minimal administrative and teaching funds. An increasing number of places are delaying the payment of teachers' salaries and subsidies.

Primary and secondary school teachers have low economic benefits, poor living conditions, and an unstable workforce. There is also a lack of incentives for outstanding students to pursue teaching careers.

In response to the current problems, the following suggestions were made:

Further promote local leaders to recognize the strategic position of education in economic development; encourage local governments to strictly implement the Compulsory Education Law and implement nine-year compulsory education in a phased and stepwise manner according to local conditions; promote a shift in educational philosophy and deepen the reform of the rural education system; further implement and improve policies for securing funds for compulsory education to ensure a stable and reliable source of funds.

Vice Chairpersons of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Yan Jici, Chen Muhua, and Lei Jieqiong attended the meeting.

Commissioners Zhang Chengxian, Liu Bing, Yang Haibo, Li Zehou, Ye Duzheng, Zhu Dexi, and Wu Jieping spoke at the meeting.

　　全国人大教科文卫委员会和国家教委调查浙黑陇三省
    《义务教育法》实施情况忧喜参半
    本报北京１月３１日讯  记者魏玉凤报道：今天，全国人大教科文卫委员会在人民大会堂召开扩大会议，听取对浙江、黑龙江、甘肃三省实施《义务教育法》情况的检查汇报，研究普及义务教育的问题。
    去年９月，全国人大教科文卫委员会和国家教委联合组织检查组，分别对浙江、黑龙江、甘肃三省实施《义务教育法》的情况进行了检查。情况表明，《义务教育法》的贯彻，推动了地方党政领导机构愈来愈多的同志重视教育，特别是重视基础教育，也推动了不同类型地区普及不同程度教育的发展。地处沿海的浙江省，各城市和５３８个乡、镇（约９３０万人口）已经实施了９年义务教育，其余地方都在实施初等义务教育。甘肃省属于困难地区，初等教育阶段学龄儿童入学率也由１９８３年的８３．１％上升到１９８７年的９２．２％；有３５个县基本普及了初等教育，占全省总县数的４０％。《义务教育法》的实施，调动了地方和广大人民群众办学的积极性，许多地方出现了改善办学条件的热潮；还促进了基础教育办学指导思想的转变，特别是农村教育正在转向为当地经济和社会发展服务的轨道。
    联合检查组认为，在看到成绩的同时，当前尤需研究解决实施过程中存在的严重困难和问题：
    一些领导对教育重要性认识不足，特别是对提高劳动者素质缺乏紧迫感。调查中看到，有的地方高档宾馆一栋栋拔地而起，而中小学的“二部制”、危房比比皆是。
    中小学生中途辍学的现象比较严重。据甘肃省统计，１９８７至１９８８学年度小学在校生流失率为４．９２％，比１９８６至１９８７学年度上升了０．２％。浙江省统计，初中在校生流失率１９８５年为６．８％，１９８７年为７．３％。黑龙江省统计，１９８７年初中学生流失率达到７．８％。
    教育经费不足，是当前普遍存在的一个问题。从调查的情况看，《义务教育法》中关于教育经费增长必须高于财政经常性收入增长比例的规定，在大多数地方都未落实；教育经费在当地财政支出中所占比重也不断下降。同时，在教育经费开支中，由于人员经费猛增，公用经费所占比重急剧下降，再加上物价上涨因素，实际上公用经费呈负增长之势。由于经费短缺，中小学的办学条件仍然很差。许多地方很少拨给中小学办公费和教学业务费。有愈来愈多的地方拖欠教师的工资和补贴费。
    中小学教师经济待遇低，生活条件差，队伍不稳定，并且缺乏对优秀学生报考师范的吸引力。
    针对当前存在的问题，汇报中提出如下建议：
    进一步推动地方各级领导同志切实落实教育在经济发展中的战略地位；推动各地人民政府严格执行《义务教育法》，因地制宜地分阶段有步骤地实施九年义务教育；推动办学指导思想的转变，深化农村教育体制的改革；进一步落实和完善实施义务教育资金的筹措政策，使所需资金有一个稳定、可靠的来源，得到基本保证。
    全国人大常委会副委员长严济慈、陈慕华、雷洁琼出席了会议。
    张承先、刘冰、杨海波、李泽厚、叶笃正、朱德熙、吴阶平等委员发了言。
