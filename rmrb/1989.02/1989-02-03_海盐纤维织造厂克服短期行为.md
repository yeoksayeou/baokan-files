Haiyan County Special Fiber Weaving Mill, a joint-stock enterprise, allocates more than 60% of its annual net profit to expanding production and continuously developing new products of anti-static workwear. Local banking officials praised the mill for setting a good example in overcoming short-term behavior.

The mill was established at the end of 1984 with an initial investment of 25,000 yuan from five farmers. In early 1986, they decisively purchased the conductive fiber technology jointly developed by China Textile University and the Shanghai Institute of Labor Protection for 100,000 yuan. They quickly developed the country's first anti-static fabric and anti-static workwear. In 1986 and 1987, the mill earned a net income of 590,000 yuan. They allocated 295,000 yuan for working capital and 60,000 yuan as a risk fund, totaling 60% of the net income. In 1988, production and income reached new heights, with a net profit of 330,000 yuan. The management decided to allocate 200,000 yuan annually to strengthen the enterprise fund, accounting for 60% of the total profit. Workers, seeing the leadership's commitment, also increased their investments. The total capital now stands at 150,000 yuan, with working capital at 850,000 yuan.

Relying on their growing financial strength, they developed products of high quality and diverse varieties. Various colors of anti-static fabrics and stylish workwear are highly popular. The Shandong Provincial Petroleum Company mandated that all its subsidiaries use fabric from the Haiyan Special Fiber Weaving Mill for their workwear. The mill's developed anti-static dust filter material has obtained a patent, and anti-slip, oil-resistant, anti-static work shoes are set to enter the market.

　　海盐纤维织造厂克服短期行为
    本报讯  记者萧关根报道：联户股份企业——海盐县特种纤维织造厂每年将纯利润的６０％以上用于扩大再生产，不断开发防静电工作服新产品。当地银行界的同志称赞这个厂“为克服短期行为树立了一个好榜样。”
    这个厂是５户农民集股２．５万元于１９８４年底创办的。１９８６年初，他们果断地以１０万元买下了中国纺织大学和上海劳动保护科学研究所联合研制成的导电纤维技术，并很快开发成国内首创的防静电面料和防静电工作服。１９８６年和１９８７年共得纯收入５９万元，他们用２９．５万元充作流动资金，６万元作为风险基金，两项占纯收入的６０％。１９８８年，生产和收入又上新台阶，获净利润３３万元。厂领导又决定每年拿出２０万元充实企业基金，占全部利润的６０％。工人们看到领导有事业心，入股的也越来越多，目前总股金已达１５万元，流动资金８５万元。
    依靠日益壮大的资金实力，他们开发的产品质量好、品种多。各种颜色的抗静电面料和款式多样的时装化工作服，深受欢迎。山东省石油公司规定，下属单位制做工作服“所用衣料必须购买浙江海盐特种纤维织造厂生产的仿毛衣料”。该厂开发的防静电除尘滤料已获得了专利；防滑耐油防静电工作皮鞋将投放市场。
