	Agriculture urgently needs investment, and the land tax that should be returned to the fields cannot be withheld. The state requires the recovery of overdue land occupation tax. Taxes must be collected strictly in accordance with the law, and there should be no exceptions for individuals.

	Newspaper report from Beijing, January 31 (Reporter Huang Zhenggen): China's agriculture is currently in urgent need of investment. However, due to some local or departmental leaders' insufficient understanding of the significance of collecting land occupation tax and inadequate work, some taxes that should have been collected have not been collected.

	The head of the Agricultural Tax Collection and Management Bureau of the Ministry of Finance provided the following information to the reporter: In 1988, the national land occupation tax collected amounted to 1.782 billion yuan, achieving significant progress. Out of the 29 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions (excluding Tibet) and 9 planned single-list cities, the following had good collection records: Qingdao, Shanghai, Wuhan, Shanxi, Qinghai, Dalian, Liaoning, Shenyang, and Yunnan. The following had poor collection records: Tianjin and Chongqing.

	The information also shows that several major land users in the country have not been enthusiastic about paying taxes. The transportation sector's road construction occupied approximately 320,000 mu of cultivated land, with a tax of 420 million yuan to be collected. The water and electricity sector's hydropower projects, according to statistics from 6 out of 13 provinces and regions, occupied approximately 95,000 mu of cultivated land, with a tax of 290 million yuan to be collected. The coal and metallurgical mining sectors occupied 32,000 mu of cultivated land, with a tax of 120 million yuan to be collected. However, they have used various excuses to delay or wait and see, and some have even been in arrears for a long time.

	The head of the Agricultural Tax Bureau told the reporter that the collection of land occupation tax in accordance with the law is carried out in accordance with the spirit of the State Council's notice on the promulgation of the "Provisional Regulations on the Administration of Land Occupation Tax of the People's Republic of China" on April 1, 1987. Currently, some places have weak legal awareness and do not collect taxes in accordance with the law, and some even refuse to do so. For example, a power plant in a certain province in central China should have collected 80 million yuan in land occupation tax, but they refused to pay a single cent. The financial department collected 20 million yuan from the unit's bank account in accordance with the law, but they asked the leaders to intervene, and the bank had to return the money to the tax-paying unit.

	In response to the difficulty in collecting land occupation tax in China, a leading comrade of the State Council recently made a note on the Ministry of Finance's report on the national land occupation tax collection situation: "For those who should pay but have not paid and have not been approved, they must be pursued and collected in accordance with the law. Taxes must be collected strictly in accordance with the law, and there should be no exceptions for individuals." The competent business departments must do a good job in ensuring that their subordinate units pay taxes in accordance with the law, and the tax collection agencies must urgently collect taxes from major tax-paying units that occupy cultivated land.

　　农业急切需要投入　还田税款岂容截留
    国家要求追缴拖欠耕地占用税
    坚决依法办税　不能因人而异
    新华社北京１月３１日电  （记者黄正根）我国农业当前急切地呼唤着投入，而国家规定应全部返回农业用于投入的耕地占用税，却由于一些地区或部门的领导对征收耕地占用税的意义认识不足，工作抓得不够紧，致使一些应征的税款未能征起来。
    财政部农业税征收管理局负责人今天向记者提供了一份材料：１９８８年耕地占用税全国共入库１７．８２亿元，取得了可喜的进展。全国２９个省、市、自治区（西藏除外）和９个计划单列市征收较好的有：青岛、上海、武汉、山西、青海、大连、辽宁、沈阳、云南等。征收较差的有：天津和重庆市。
    这份材料还表明，全国有几家占用耕地多的大户交税态度不积极。交通部门公路建设占用耕地约３２万亩，应征收耕地占用税４．２亿元。水电部门的水电工程建设项目，据对１３个省、区的其中６个地区统计，占用耕地约为９．５万亩，应征收耕地占用税２．９亿元。煤炭、冶金开采等占用耕地３．２万亩，应征收耕地占用税１．２亿元。但他们以种种理由不交或等待观望，有的甚至长期拖欠。
    农税局负责人对记者说，依法缴纳耕地占用税，是按照１９８７年４月１日国务院关于发布《中华人民共和国耕地占用税暂行条例》的通知精神执行的。现在有的地方法制观念淡薄，没有依法办税，有的甚至顶着不办。例如，中南某省办的一个电厂本应征收耕地占用税８００万元，可他们顶着分文不交。财政部门依法在银行帐户上扣留该单位２００万元，他们却请领导出面干预，银行只好把钱退回纳税单位。
    针对我国耕地占用税征收难度大的状况，国务院领导同志最近对财政部关于全国耕地占用税入库情况的通报作了批示：“对应缴未缴又未经批准的，一律追缴，坚决依法办税，不能因人而异”。业务主管部门要做好所属单位依法纳税的工作，征收机关对占用耕地的纳税大户必须抓紧征收。
