Tianjin Kena Refrigerator Factory, one of the major backbone enterprises in China's refrigerator industry, has focused on reducing consumption and technological advancement in the face of significant price increases in raw materials and imported components. Their four-star Kena brand double-door refrigerators have a retail price per cubic meter that is 40% lower than the average market price for similar products.

In 1988, with the price increases in steel, fuel, and compressors and other raw materials and components, many refrigerator manufacturers adjusted their prices. Kena Refrigerator Factory also did the calculations: just the increase in steel and compressor costs alone would raise the cost of each refrigerator by 480 yuan, leading to an annual increase of over 96 million yuan for a production of 200,000 units. Many people thought that the factory's products should be priced accordingly. However, the factory leadership did not take this approach. They mobilized all employees to look inward for potential, implementing layer-by-layer contracts, and finding ways to offset the increased costs through increased production and savings. They improved the design of the evaporator structure, enhancing product quality and reducing costs by over 40 yuan per unit. The factory also adjusted the savings reward system, saving an additional 62.4 million yuan.

　　天津可耐冰箱厂稳定产品价格
    本报讯  记者李茜报道：我国冰箱行业大型骨干企业之一的天津可耐电冰箱厂，在原材料和进口部件大幅度提价的情况下，在降低消耗和技术进步上做文章。他们生产的四星级可耐牌双门电冰箱，每立升零售价比市场同类产品平均价格低４０％。
    １９８８年随着钢材、燃料和压缩机等原材料及零部件涨价，许多电冰箱纷纷调价，可耐冰箱厂也算了一笔帐：仅钢材和压缩机两项，每台电冰箱成本就提高４８０元，全年生产２０万台，将使成本提高９６００多万元。不少人认为，这个厂的产品应该相应提价。但是，厂领导班子没有这样做，他们发动全厂职工眼睛向内挖潜力，层层承包，从增产节约中把涨价的超支部分找回来。他们从设计上改进蒸发器的结构，提高了产品质量，每台可降低成本４０多元；全厂调整了节约奖励办法，又节约６２４多万元。
