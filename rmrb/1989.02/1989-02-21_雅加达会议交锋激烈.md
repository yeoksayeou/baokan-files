	Heated Debate at Jakarta Meeting

	According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Jakarta on February 19, the informal meeting in Jakarta today saw intense exchanges over the Cambodian issue. Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the Prime Minister of the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea, reiterated that Vietnam's withdrawal from Cambodia must have a definite timetable and must be unconditional and under international supervision. Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach, however, insisted on Vietnam's rigid stance on the Cambodian issue: Vietnam's withdrawal must be conditioned on ensuring that the Khmer Rouge does not regain power. This indicates that Vietnam still lacks sincerity in resolving the Cambodian issue. Thai Foreign Minister Siddhi Savetsila and Singaporean Foreign Minister S. Rajaratnam also spoke at today's meeting. (For more details, see page 3 of today's issue.)
