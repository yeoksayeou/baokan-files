The United Nations Secretary-General issued a statement on the Afghan situation, calling for restraint to avoid escalation of the war and achieve national reconciliation. A U.S. official said the guerrillas plan to completely surround Kabul.

BEIJING, Feb. 1 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar today issued a statement here, calling on all parties in Afghanistan to exercise restraint to avoid escalating the conflict and achieve national reconciliation.

The statement was issued as Soviet occupying forces are about to complete their withdrawal from Afghanistan.

De Cuéllar called on all Afghans to peacefully resolve their differences at this historic moment and establish a broadly-based government through internal dialogue in Afghanistan. He pointed out that the Afghan people now face the great challenge of achieving a comprehensive political solution and beginning to rebuild their homeland. Only a comprehensive political solution can create the necessary conditions for millions of refugees to return to their homes voluntarily and with dignity.

De Cuéllar finally called on the international community to provide adequate financial and material assistance to Afghanistan to speed up the repatriation of Afghan refugees and the economic and social reconstruction of Afghanistan. He said the United Nations will continue to make efforts in this regard.

WASHINGTON, Jan. 31 (Xinhua) -- An official from the U.S. State Department said that Afghan anti-government guerrillas plan to completely surround Kabul after the Soviet troops withdraw from Afghanistan.

According to this U.S. official, the number of refugees flowing into Kabul from rural areas has reached 1 million, and the food and fuel currently available in the city can only last for a few days. The United States, Italy, the Federal Republic of Germany, and other Western countries have closed their embassies in Kabul, and many other countries are also gradually withdrawing their diplomatic personnel from Afghanistan.

　　联合国秘书长就阿富汗局势发表声明
    避免战争升级　实现民族和解
    美官员说游击队将全面包围喀布尔
    本报联合国２月１日电  记者刘开宸报道：联合国秘书长佩雷斯·德奎利亚尔今天在这里发表声明，呼吁阿富汗有关各方采取克制态度，避免战斗升级，实现民族和解。
    这项声明是德奎利亚尔在苏联占领军行将全部撤出阿富汗之际发表的。
    德奎利亚尔号召所有阿富汗人在此历史时刻和平地解决分歧，通过阿富汗内部对话建立一个基础广泛的政府。他指出，现在阿富汗人民面临着实现全面政治解决、开始重建家园的巨大挑战。只有全面的政治解决才能为几百万难民体面而安全地自愿返回家园创造必要条件。
    德奎利亚尔最后呼吁国际社会对阿富汗提供充分的财政和物资援助以加快阿富汗难民的遣返工作和阿富汗的经济和社会重建工作。他表示联合国将在这方面继续做出努力。
    新华社华盛顿１月３１日电　美国国务院的一位官员说，阿富汗反政府游击队计划在苏军撤出阿富汗之后，将对喀布尔实行全面包围。
    据这位美国官员透露，目前从农村地区流入喀布尔市的难民已达１００万，市内现存的食品和燃料仅够维持几天。美国、意大利、联邦德国等西方国家已关闭了设在喀布尔的大使馆，其它许多国家也正在将驻阿的外交人员陆续撤出。
