The application process for the 1989 National Invention Award has concluded. After preliminary review by the office of the Invention Award Evaluation Committee, 190 projects met the criteria for nomination. It has been decided to publicly announce 150 of these projects (see February 28 issue of Guangming Daily and Science and Technology Daily), while the remaining 40 will be internally announced.

To strengthen social supervision of the Invention Award and prevent plagiarism and fraud, any unit or individual who has objections regarding the novelty, advancement, or practicality of the nominated projects, or regarding the inventors, may submit a written objection to the office of the National Invention Award Evaluation Committee within two months from the date of publication. Objections submitted after the objection period will generally not be accepted. Once the objection period has ended, projects without objections or those for which objections have been resolved will be evaluated by the various evaluation bodies of the National Invention Award Evaluation Committee. Projects that meet the award criteria will be approved and awarded immediately.
