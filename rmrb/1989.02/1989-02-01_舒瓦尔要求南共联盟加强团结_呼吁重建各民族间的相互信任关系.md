South Slavic League of Communists Central Committee Chairman Shuvard today emphasized that the League of Communists of Yugoslavia must eliminate the differences between the leaderships of the various republics and pave the way for the restoration of mutual trust and respect among the nations.

Shuvard made these remarks in a report at the opening of the 20th Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. The main agenda of this plenary session is to discuss the domestic political situation in Yugoslavia, the internal relations within the League of Communists, and the work and responsibilities of the Central Committee and its Presidium.

In discussing the domestic situation, Shuvard said that the political situation in the country has not only not improved, but has worsened compared to before the 17th Plenary Session of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia last October. He stressed that the main reason the resolutions of the 17th Plenary Session have not been implemented is the conflict between the forces of reform and the anti-reform forces.

In discussing the self-reform of the League, Shuvard pointed out that the most important thing is to eliminate the political monopoly of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, while strengthening the vanguard role of the League and the role of ideological and political cohesion.

Regarding the recent establishment of various social organizations and political groups in Yugoslavia, especially in Slovenia, Shuvard pointed out that the democratic sentiments of the people should be open, and the demands for organization on the basis of political pluralism within the constitutional framework should be open. However, he warned that vigilance must be maintained against forces that seek to abolish socialism and demand that the League of Communists of Yugoslavia exit the historical stage.

In discussing the dissatisfaction of the working class and the people, Shuvard said that nearly 2,000 strikes were held in Yugoslavia last year, involving a total of 360,000 people. He believes that most of the workers' strikes and mass rallies are loyal to socialism and the achievements of the revolution, and therefore the League must stand on the side of the people. But he emphasized that the dissatisfaction of the people can also be misused, and so far there have been cases of nationalist and hostile forces taking advantage of the situation. He said that the wave of resignations caused by strikes and mass rallies has also led to the removal of some capable, honest, and politically innocent leaders.

Shuvard stressed that the most important task today is to overcome the differences within the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. He warned that if these differences are not sincerely and comradely clarified, it will lead to the split of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia.

　　舒瓦尔要求南共联盟加强团结
    呼吁重建各民族间的相互信任关系
    据新华社贝尔格莱德１月３０日电  南共联盟中央主席团主席舒瓦尔今天强调，南共联盟必须消除各共和国共盟领导间的分歧，为重新建立各民族间互相信任和互相尊重的关系铺平道路。
    舒瓦尔是在今天开幕的南共联盟２０中全会上作报告时说这番话的。这次全会的主要议题是讨论南斯拉夫国内政治形势、南共联盟内部关系以及中央委员会及其主席团的工作和责任问题。
    舒瓦尔在谈到国内形势时说，国内政治形势不仅没有好转，反而比南共联盟去年１０月召开的１７中全会前更糟。他强调，１７中全会决议没能贯彻的主要原因是，改革力量和反改革势力之间发生了冲突。
    在谈到共盟自身改革时，舒瓦尔指出，最重要的是要消除南共联盟的政治垄断，同时加强共盟的先锋队作用和思想政治凝聚因素的作用。
    针对南斯拉夫、尤其是斯洛文尼亚近来陆续成立各种社会团体和政治组织的情况，舒瓦尔指出，对人民群众的民主情绪要开放，对在宪法范围内政治多元化基础上组织起来的要求要开放。但是，对那种要求取消社会主义，要求南共联盟退出历史舞台的势力必须保持警惕。
    在谈到工人阶级和人民群众的不满情绪时，舒瓦尔说，去年南斯拉夫共举行了将近２０００起罢工，总共有３６万人参加。他认为，大多数工人罢工和群众集会是忠于社会主义和革命成果的，因此共盟必须站在人民群众一边。但他强调，人民群众的不满情绪也可能被滥用，至今已出现了民族主义势力和敌对势力混水摸鱼的情况。他说，由于罢工和群众集会引起的辞职风也使一些能干的、正直的和政治上无辜的领导人下台了。
    舒瓦尔强调，今天应该做的最重要的工作就是克服南共联盟内的分歧。他警告说，如果不能开诚布公、同志式地澄清这些分歧，将会引起南共联盟的分裂。
