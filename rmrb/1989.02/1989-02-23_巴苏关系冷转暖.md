Over the past year, as the Soviet Union withdrew its troops from Afghanistan in accordance with the Geneva Accords, relations between Pakistan and the Soviet Union have shown signs of improvement.

Due to historical and contemporary reasons, there have been some disagreements between Pakistan and the Soviet Union. In the 1950s and 1960s, the Soviet Union sided with India on the Kashmir issue, drawing criticism from Pakistan. In 1971, the Soviet Union supported India in the partition of Pakistan. On the Afghanistan issue, the Soviet Union supported the Kabul regime, while Pakistan backed the Afghan resistance forces. Today, although the Kashmir dispute remains a historical issue, former East Pakistan, now Bangladesh, has become a friendly neighbor to Pakistan. The Soviet military has completely withdrawn from Afghanistan, so it can be said that the main obstacles to improving Pakistan-Soviet relations have been removed.

In fact, after the signing of the Geneva Accords on the settlement of the Afghanistan issue in April last year, Pakistan and the Soviet Union, as two signatory countries, began to improve their relations. On November 3, the two countries jointly submitted a proposal to the 43rd UN General Assembly for a political settlement of the Afghanistan issue, which was adopted without debate. This was the first time that Pakistan and the Soviet Union cooperated on a major international issue. On December 3, Pakistan's new Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, in her policy speech, pointed out that her government would seek ways to improve Pakistan-Soviet relations and develop bilateral relations with the Soviet Union, "this great neighbor." At that time, the Soviet troops were in the final stages of withdrawal from Afghanistan, and the political settlement of the Afghanistan issue was at a critical juncture. Pakistan played a crucial role in resolving the Afghanistan issue. Therefore, the Soviet side frequently expressed friendly gestures to Pakistan, hoping to improve relations. In January of this year, the Soviet Union's First Deputy Foreign Minister visited Pakistan and handed a personal letter from Gorbachev to Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. The letter expressed the hope that the two countries' relations could return to the level of the early 1970s when Bhutto was in power, and stated a willingness to help Pakistan expand and build some key projects. Benazir Bhutto said that after the peaceful resolution of the Afghanistan issue, bilateral relations between Pakistan and the Soviet Union would be further improved.

The visit of Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze to Pakistan this month is the first visit by a Soviet foreign minister to the country and the highest-level visit by a Soviet official in 20 years. Although there are still some differences in the positions of the two countries on the Afghanistan issue, both sides hope to improve relations, especially to develop economic and trade cooperation. According to Shevardnadze, the Soviet Union will help Pakistan build two hydroelectric power stations, further develop and utilize oil and natural gas, expand the Karachi Steel Mill, and build new tractor and machinery factories. He also said that Pakistan's Minister of State for Production, Zafar, would soon visit the Soviet Union. The Soviet trade representative in Pakistan recently revealed that in addition to sending experts to assist Pakistan in exploring oil and natural gas, the Soviet Union will also start the construction of 12 large-scale projects in Pakistan this year, and the bilateral trade volume may increase by approximately 30% compared to the previous year. The two countries also plan to establish a ministerial-level joint committee to specifically discuss economic and trade cooperation.

After decades of stagnation, Pakistan-Soviet relations have finally shown signs of improvement. However, this development will still be constrained by factors such as the situation in South Asia.

　　巴苏关系冷转暖
    本报记者  任毓骏
    去年以来，随着苏联按照日内瓦协议规定从阿富汗撤军，巴基斯坦和苏联的关系出现了改善的趋势。
    由于历史和现实的原因，巴苏之间存在一些分歧。５０至６０年代，苏联在克什米尔问题上站在印度一边，遭巴基斯坦谴责。１９７１年，苏联支持印度肢解巴基斯坦。在阿富汗问题上，苏联支持喀布尔政权，而巴基斯坦则支持阿富汗抵抗力量。如今，克什米尔争端虽然仍是个历史问题，但过去的东巴——今天的孟加拉国已成为巴基斯坦的友好邻邦，苏联军队业已全部撤出阿富汗，可以说，巴苏改善关系的主要障碍已经消除。
    事实上，去年４月关于解决阿富汗问题的日内瓦协议签订之后，巴基斯坦和苏联作为两个签字国已开始改善关系。１１月３日，两国联合向第４３届联大提出了关于政治解决阿富汗问题的建议，大会未经辩论即予通过。这是巴苏第一次在重大国际问题上合作。１２月３日，巴基斯坦新总理贝·布托在施政演说中指出，她的政府将寻求改善巴苏关系的途径，和苏联“这一伟大的邻邦”发展双边关系。这时苏军撤出阿富汗已进入最后阶段，政治解决阿富汗问题进入关键时刻，而巴基斯坦在解决阿富汗问题上又起着举足轻重的作用。于是，苏联方面又频频向巴基斯坦发出希望改善关系的友好表示。今年１月，苏联第一副外长访问巴基斯坦并向贝·布托总理递交了戈尔巴乔夫的亲笔信。信中希望两国关系能恢复到７０年代初布托总理执政时的水平，并表示愿意帮助巴基斯坦扩建和援建一些重点项目。贝·布托表示，待阿富汗问题和平解决后，巴苏双边关系将进一步得到改善。
    苏联外长谢瓦尔德纳泽本月访问巴基斯坦，是苏联外长第一次访问这个国家，也是２０年来访巴级别最高的苏联官员。双方虽然在阿富汗问题上的立场仍有一些差距，但都希望改善两国关系特别是发展经贸合作。据谢瓦尔德纳泽说，苏联将帮助巴基斯坦建设两个水力发电站，进一步开发和利用石油和天然气，扩建卡拉奇钢铁厂，新建拖拉机厂和机械设备厂。他还说，巴基斯坦生产国务部长扎法尔将很快访问苏联，苏联驻巴基斯坦的贸易代表最近还透露，目前苏联除派专家协助巴基斯坦勘探石油和天然气外，今年还将在巴基斯坦开始１２个大型项目的建设，双边贸易额有可能比上年度增加大约３０％。两国还计划成立一个部长级联合委员会，专门磋商经贸合作。
    经过数十年的停滞，今天，巴苏关系终于出现了改善的趋向。但这种发展仍将受到南亚次大陆局势等因素的制约。
