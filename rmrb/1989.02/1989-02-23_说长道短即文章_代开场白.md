Talking about pros and cons can have many interpretations. Writing articles about talking about pros and cons can also be diverse. In terms of content, one can talk about the pros (good points) or the cons (bad points), as long as it is factual and reasonable, whether praising or criticizing, it is up to the individual; in terms of form, one can say a lot in a few words or say a little in many words, as long as it is meaningful and the readers like it, one can write freely; in terms of the aspects involved, from major national issues to minor family matters, as long as it is part of social life, whether expressing personal emotions or personal views, as long as it is beneficial to reform and modernization, and beneficial to the overall stability and unity, it will be valued by the editors.

According to the usual understanding, talking about pros and cons is not something that belongs to the realm of high culture. When giving a report at a meeting or speaking at a discussion, no one calls it talking about pros and cons; when flattering or defending oneself, no one says it is talking about pros and cons. Talking about pros and cons often refers to discussing behind someone's back, and it is not the same concept as "making strange remarks" or "complaining." Life is very complicated. Some people are willing to put things on the table, while others prefer to discuss them behind someone's back. Especially in the current situation where there are different degrees of problems with party discipline and social ethics, and when the central authorities emphasize "rectification" and "regulation," the words put on the table should be listened to, and the words discussed behind someone's back should also be listened to. Only in this way can we further open up channels for expression, promote democracy, gather wisdom, improve work styles, overcome shortcomings, make up for mistakes, further enhance the public's confidence and determination, and further enhance the cohesion of the entire nation.

Due to various reasons, some people, when speaking, do not first consider what they want to say, but rather consider what the other party wants to hear and what they do not want to hear. Therefore, in front of superiors, subordinates, colleagues, and "friends," there are different ways of expression. Some people can only speak the truth when they return home and talk to their wife and children. There may be some sympathetic elements in this, but it is definitely not normal. The "Talking About Pros and Cons" column is precisely to provide everyone with a place to exchange ideas, discuss problems, and speak their minds.

May friends all work hard in this garden.

### 说长道短即文章——代开场白

　　说长道短即文章
    ——代开场白
    吴昊
    说长道短可以有多种解释。写说长道短的文章也可以多种多样。从内容来说，可以说长（处），也可以道短（处），只要实事求是、言之成理，或褒或贬，皆由自己做主；从形式来说，可以长话短说，也可以短话长说，只要言之有物，读者喜爱，尽可信笔写来；从涉及的方面来说，大到国事，小到家事，只要属于社会生活，不管是抒发个人情感，还是表达个人见解，只要对改革和四化建设有利，对安定团结的大局有利，都会受到编辑的重视。
    按照通常的理解，说长道短是不登大雅之堂的。开会做报告，讨论会发言，没有人称之为说长道短；阿谀奉承，说理辩白，也没有人讲是说长道短。说长道短常指背后议论，它和“讲怪话”、“发牢骚”并非同一个概念。生活是非常复杂的，有的人愿意把事情往桌面上摆，有的人愿意背后议论，尤其是在目前党风、社会风气都存在不同程度问题的情况下，在中央强调“治理”“整顿”的情况下，摆在桌上的话要听，背后议论的话也要听，这样才能进一步广开言路，发扬民主，集思广益，改进作风，克服缺点，弥补失误，进一步增强群众的信心和决心，进一步增强整个民族的凝聚力。
    由于这样那样的原因，有的人讲起话来，不是先考虑自己想说什么，而是先考虑对方愿听什么，不愿听什么。因而，在上司面前，在下级面前，在同仁面前，在“朋友”面前，都有不同的表达方式。有的人只有回到家里，对老婆孩子才能讲真话，这里面或许有值得同情的成分，但毕竟是不正常的。《说长道短》这一专栏，就是要给大家提供一个交流思想、探讨问题、讲讲心里话的园地。
    愿朋友们都在这块园地上努力耕耘。
