University of Science and Technology Achieves a World Scientific Record: Superconducting Zero-Resistance Temperature Exceeds 130K

	Newspaper: Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, February 27 (Correspondent Zhu Guanghua, Reporter Xuan Fenghua) Recently, the University of Science and Technology of China successfully developed a superconducting material with a zero-resistance temperature higher than 130K—bismuth-lead-antimony-strontium-calcium-copper-oxygen superconductor, setting a new world record for the highest superconducting zero-resistance temperature.

	The first sample of this breakthrough superconducting material was developed by young physics Ph.D. Liu Hongbao and several graduate students from the University of Science and Technology of China over a period of more than three months.

	Previously, the highest superconducting zero-resistance temperature in the world was 125K. In October of last year, researchers from the Superconductivity Research Center of the University of Science and Technology of China discovered two superconductors with zero-resistance temperatures of 130K and one with a zero-resistance temperature of 164K. If these results can be replicated, they would represent a significant breakthrough in superconducting critical temperature, far surpassing the previous world record of 125K.

	In late January of this year, at the high-temperature superconductivity conference held in the Federal Republic of Germany, the Eureka Solid State Physics Research Institute announced that they had successfully replicated this superconductor using the formula and manufacturing methods provided in the paper published by Chinese scientists. They also achieved a zero-resistance temperature of 130K.

	On February 22 of this year, the Superconductivity Research Center of the University of Science and Technology of China again replicated the production of this superconductor. At a temperature of 140K, a clear Meissner effect was observed; using a measurement current of 10 microamperes, a zero-resistance temperature slightly higher than 130K was achieved, raising the currently reproducible superconducting zero-resistance temperature from 125K to over 130K.

　　科大创一项世界科技纪录
    超导零电阻温度高于１３０Ｋ
    新华社合肥２月２７日电  （通讯员朱光华、记者宣奉华）最近，中国科技大学研制成功零电阻温度高于１３０Ｋ的超导材料——铋铅锑锶钙铜氧超导体，创造了目前世界上超导零电阻温度的最高纪录。
    这一具有突破性进展的研究成果的第一块超导体样品，是中国科技大学年轻的物理学博士刘宏宝和几位研究生用３个多月的时间研制成功的。
    在此之前，世界上最高的超导零电阻温度是１２５Ｋ。去年１０月，中国科技大学超导研究中心的研究人员发现了两个零电阻温度为１３０Ｋ和一个零电阻温度为１６４Ｋ的铋铅锑锶钙铜氧超导体。这一结果如能重复，就是超导临界温度的重大进展和突破，远远超过原有的世界纪录１２５Ｋ。
    今年元月下旬，在德意志联邦共和国召开的高温超导体学术会议上，尤里卡固体物理研究所宣布，他们根据中国科技大学科学家们公布的论文中所提供的配方和工艺制作方法，也获得了这种超导体，并重复实现了１３０Ｋ的零电阻温度。
    今年２月２２日，中国科技大学超导研究中心再次重复制造出这种超导体，在温度１４０Ｋ时出现明显的迈斯纳效应；用１０微安的测量电流，重现了略高于１３０Ｋ的零电阻温度，把目前人类能够重复的超导零电阻温度由１２５Ｋ提高到１３０Ｋ以上。
