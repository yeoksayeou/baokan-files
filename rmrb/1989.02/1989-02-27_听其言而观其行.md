Listen to Their Words and Observe Their Actions

Shū Wú

Lying in bed, I hear the bell tolling the deep night,
In the vast sea and sky, my fleeting dreams are hard to find.
The tower leans, the wind howls fiercely,
The lighthouse faintly glows under the half-moon's shadow.
Good friends have long since passed through countless calamities,
The land of gods sees another century of turmoil.
Sadly, I do not sigh like a lonely traveler,
Reflecting on my life, I see that my heart is not yet at ease.

This is a poem by a patriotic scholar. See how much he cares about the nation's peril and pain! See his thoughts, his aspirations, how high and great they are! During his journey across Zero Ding Yang, Wen Tianxiang could only sigh sadly, only think of failing and seeking death; but this scholar is much higher than Wen Tianxiang, he does not want to die, he wants to live on strongly, to continue the struggle for his unfinished cause. — If I introduce him to you this way, would you believe it? If you have never heard of the author of this poem, you would believe it. Because the poem is written so deeply, so vast, so full of emotion, it does not seem like false words; as for the strict meter, the smooth flow of words, the freshness of language, these are secondary.

You would eagerly ask, who is this poet?

So, I tell you, it is the famous Wang Jingwei, who in December 1938 issued a statement of surrender, betraying the country to join the Japanese invaders, and wrote this poem while sailing in the South Pacific and encountering storms.

Pfft! You would want to spit it out as if you had eaten a fly, and blame me for playing a trick on you.

I apologize to you. Please understand that I wanted to conduct a small experiment.

Our ancient literary theories have long debated a question: can language and writing truly express a person's intentions and character? Yang Xiong said: "Words are the voice of the heart. Writing is the painting of the heart. Voice and painting reveal the form, and thus the gentleman and the petty person are distinguished." He took an affirmative stance. However, Yuan Haowen wanted to overturn Yang Xiong's view, in his "Thirty Poems on Poetry" there is one that says: "The heart's painting and voice are both false, can literature truly reveal a person? High feelings in the thousand-year idle residence poem, who believes that An Ren bowed to the dust on the road?" In Pan Yue's "Idle Residence Poem," he indeed said many noble words, later the name of the Humble Administrator's Garden in Suzhou was taken from this; but the man was base and despicable, flattering the powerful Jia Mi, even bowing to the dust of Jia Mi's carriage on the road, this is an example of literature not being able to reveal a person. Here I conduct another experiment to see if literature can truly reveal a person. The result seems to also prove that Yuan Haowen's overturning is correct.

However, it may not be. Yang Xiong's mistake was mixing two things together, he did not see that whether literature can express the heart's intentions is one thing, and whether it can express a person's character is another, thus leaving a loophole. The terms "gentleman" and "petty person" are old and also very vague, but for now, let us use them. Then, from ancient times, "gentlemen" certainly have "gentlemen's" intentions, but what about "petty persons"? The more "petty" a person is, the more they will weave a set of lies, deceiving themselves and believing that they are more "gentlemanly" than "gentlemen." The self-deception of "petty persons" is also very sincere. You cannot say that they did not think this way in their daily lives, and only made up a few false words when writing. But you also cannot believe that because they said it, their words match their true character. Wang Jingwei, under the banner of "peaceful salvation of the country," betrayed the country and joined the enemy, he would believe every day and every hour that he was "saving the country and the people," so he could write such a poem. If you do not know the author, you can appreciate the poem as a poem, praising it as a good poem. If you already know the author, you certainly will not use this to exonerate Wang Jingwei, will not believe that his character is truly above Wen Tianxiang, but also, do not need to flip over and pick apart which sentence or word is not true to his heart. Yuan Haowen's mistake is here.

In fact, a poem is just a poem, Wang Jingwei did not necessarily want to draw a portrait of a "patriotic scholar" with just one poem, this is not possible, the Chinese people all understand "listen to their words and observe their actions," even Wang Jingwei who is so good at writing poetry is powerless. But he must often think this way, write this way, to seek psychological balance. As for why this poem can be remembered by some people and passed down to this day, frankly speaking, it is because it is indeed well-written, if it were a clumsy work, no one would remember it. Pan Yue's "Idle Residence Poem" is selected in the "Selections of Refined Literature," in addition to this, he has 7 more essays, 9 poems, and 5 articles selected, he is indeed an important writer in literary history that cannot be erased. Yuan Haowen's poem, although it is righteous and severe, is not trying to shake Pan Yue's position in literary history, it is just a reminder to the readers not to listen to his words and forget to observe his actions.

Today, for people to reach Pan Yue's level of literary art, it is not easy, to write poetry and fill words to have Wang Jingwei's level of skill, it is not a matter of one day or two. But as long as one has the right to citizenship, one can publish whatever kind of poetry one wants. It is just that if one wants to use a poem to draw a heroic image of oneself in the hearts of the people of the whole country, for example, the famous figure of the "Cultural Revolution" Wang Li, who today wants to draw a portrait of himself as loyal and upright above Qu Yuan and Jia Yi, he should first clearly remember that the Chinese people all understand "listen to their words and observe their actions," and secondly, he should have a basic awareness of how far his poetry is from being incomprehensible.

　　听其言而观其行
    舒芜
    卧听钟声报夜深，海天残梦杳难寻。
    柂楼欹侧风正恶，灯塔微茫月半阴。
    良友渐随千劫逝，神州又见百年沉。
    凄然不作零丁叹，检点平生未尽心。
    这是一首爱国志士的诗。请看他对国家民族的危难多么关心，痛心！请看他的思想境界，襟怀抱负，多么高，多么大！文天祥过零丁洋时只能凄然长叹，只能失败主义地但求一死；可这位志士比文天祥高多了，他不想一死了之，他还要坚强地活下去，为未竟的事业继续奋斗。——如果我向你这么介绍，你信不信？如果你从来没有听说过这首诗的作者，你会相信的。因为这首诗写得那么深沉，苍莽，那么充满了感情，不像是假话；至于格律的工切，遣词的流转，造语的清新，犹其余事。
    你会急切地打听，这位诗人倒底是谁。
    那么我告诉你，这是鼎鼎大名的汪精卫，是他１９３８年１２月发表了卖国声明，投奔日本侵略者去当头号汉奸，在南太平洋舟中遇风浪时作的。
    呸！你会吃了苍蝇似的要吐出来，并且责备我不该这么耍弄你。
    我向你道歉。请你谅解我是想做个小小的实验。
    我们古代的文论，一直在讨论着一个问题：语言文字，究竟能不能真实地表现人的心意和品格？扬雄说：“言，心声也。书，心画也。声画形，君子小人见矣”。他是持肯定态度的。但是，元好问却要翻扬雄的案，其《论诗绝句三十首》中有一首云：“心画心声总失真，文章宁复见为人？高情千古闲居赋，争信安仁拜路尘？”潘岳的《闲居赋》里的确说了许多高尚其志的话，后来苏州的拙政园的命名即出于此；但是其人卑污苟贱，谄事权贵贾谧，甚至望贾谧的车尘而在路旁下拜，这是文章很不足见为人的一例。我这里再作一个实验，看看文章究竟能否见为人。结果似乎也证明元好问的翻案是对的。
    然而也未必。扬雄错在把两件事混为一谈，他没有看出文章能否表现心意是一回事，能否表现人品又是一回事，这就留下了破绽。“君子小人”之称很旧，也很笼统，现在我们姑且沿用吧。那么，从来“君子”固然会有“君子”的心意，而“小人”呢？愈是“小人”，也愈会编织一套，自欺自信，自以为比“君子”还要“君子”。“小人”的这种自欺自信，也是非常真诚的。你不能说他平日没这样想，临下笔时才编几句假话。但是你也不能因为他说的，便相信他的话符合于他的人品的真实。汪精卫打着“和平救国”的旗号叛国投敌，他会一天二十四小时相信自己是为了“救国救民”，所以才写得出那样的诗。你如果不知道作者，你不妨就诗论诗，赞它是好诗。你既已知道作者，你当然不会据此去为汪精卫翻案，不会相信他的人品真在文天祥之上，但是，也不必翻转去挑剔诗中哪一句哪一字说的是不符他真心的假话。元好问之失在此。
    其实，一首诗不过就是一首诗，汪精卫倒也未必想凭一首诗就给自己画出一幅“爱国志士”的形象，这是办不到的，中国人都懂得“听其言而观其行”，即使汪精卫那样会作诗的也无能为力。不过他总得经常这么想想，这么写写，以求得心理的平衡。至于这首诗之所以能为一些人一直记住，流传至今，坦率地说，是因为实在做得好的缘故，如果是一首拙劣之作，谁也不会记住了。潘岳的《闲居赋》被选在《文选》里，此外他还有赋７篇、诗９首、文５篇入选，毕竟是文学史上抹杀不了的重要作家。元好问那首绝句尽管义正词严，也并不是想动摇潘岳文学史上的地位，不过提醒读者一声，不要听其言忘了观其行而已。
    今天的人，要达到潘岳那样的文艺水平，谈何容易，做诗填词要能有汪精卫那样的功夫，也非一朝一夕之事。但凡有公民权的人，要发表什么样的诗都有他的自由。只是他如果想凭一首诗便在全国人心目中给自己画下一个什么英雄形象，例如“文革”中的风云人物王力先生，今天要给自己画出一幅忠贞高过屈原贾谊的形象之类，他首先应该清醒地记住中国人都懂得“听其言而观其行”，其次应该对自己的诗距离不通尚有多远有个起码的自觉才好。
