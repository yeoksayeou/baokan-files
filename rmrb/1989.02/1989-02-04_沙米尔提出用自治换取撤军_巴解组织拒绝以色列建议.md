Shamir Proposes Autonomy in Exchange for Withdrawal
PLO Rejects Israeli Suggestion

CAIRO, Feb. 2 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman for the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), Rahmeh, said in Tunis yesterday that Israeli Prime Minister Shamir's proposal of "autonomy in exchange for withdrawal" is outdated.

Shamir said yesterday in Jerusalem during a meeting with a delegation of American Jewish rabbis that Israel is willing to withdraw its troops from some cities in the West Bank and Gaza Strip during the transitional period before the final resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict, provided the Palestinians accept an autonomy plan.

Rahmeh stated that Shamir's proposal is outdated. This is not a proposal for peace but for continued occupation.

He emphasized: "The Palestinian people are fighting for self-determination, the complete withdrawal of Israel, and the independence of their country. Therefore, the uprising in the occupied territories will continue. There is no other solution."

According to reports from Jerusalem today, many Palestinians oppose Shamir's limited autonomy plan. They stress that these ideas aim to bypass the PLO and deceive the Palestinians into not establishing a state. They say: "Israel must recognize that we want a comprehensive peace solution. We will ultimately gain sovereignty over the West Bank and Gaza Strip."

CAIRO, Feb. 1 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Shamir today expressed his willingness to withdraw Israeli troops from certain cities in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, but on the condition that the Palestinians accept an autonomy plan during the transitional period before the final resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict.

Shamir made this statement during a meeting with a delegation of American Jewish rabbis visiting Israel.

Previously, he had firmly opposed the idea of giving up any occupied territory in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and Arab countries. Observers here believe that Shamir's statement is a minor concession made under pressure from the 14-month Palestinian uprising.

Earlier, on Jan. 31, Shamir told a reporter from the French newspaper Le Monde that Israel is prepared to hold talks with the Palestinians in the occupied territories, but he added that the establishment of an independent Palestinian state in the near future is impossible.

　　沙米尔提出用自治换取撤军
　  巴解组织拒绝以色列建议
    新华社开罗２月２日电  巴勒斯坦解放组织发言人拉赫迈１日在突尼斯对新闻界说，以色列总理沙米尔提出“以自治换撤军”的建议过时了。
    沙米尔１日在耶路撒冷会见美国犹太教教士团时说，如果巴勒斯坦人在最终解决阿拉伯─以色列冲突之前的过渡期内接受自治方案的话，以色列准备从约旦河西岸和加沙地带的一些城市撤军。
    拉赫迈说，沙米尔的上述建议过时了。这不是一个和平的建议，而是为了继续占领。
    他强调：“巴勒斯坦人民正在为自决、以色列全部撤军和为他们的国家独立而斗争。所以，被占领土的起义将持续下去。没有其他解决办法。”
    据今天来自耶路撒冷的报道，许多巴勒斯坦人士反对沙米尔的有限自治方案。他们强调，这些想法旨在避开巴解组织，欺骗巴勒斯坦人不要建立国家。他们说：“以色列必须认识到，我们希望有一个全面的和平解决方案。我们将最终取得对约旦河西岸和加沙地带的主权。”
    新华社开罗２月１日电　以色列总理沙米尔今天表示愿意从约旦河西岸和加沙地带的某些城市撤走以军，但条件是在最终解决阿拉伯─以色列冲突之前的临时时期，巴勒斯坦人接受自治方案。
    沙米尔是在会见正在以色列访问的美国犹太教教士团时作出上述表示的。
    过去，他坚决反对放弃任何一块被占领土以换取同巴勒斯坦人和阿拉伯国家和平相处的想法。此间观察家认为，沙米尔的上述表示是巴勒斯坦人进行１４个月起义的压力下作出的某种微小让步。
    在此之前，沙米尔１月３１日对法国《世界报》记者说，以色列准备同被占领土的巴勒斯坦人进行会谈，但他又说，在近期内成立一个独立的巴勒斯坦国是不可能的。
