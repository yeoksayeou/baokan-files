After the issuance of the "Decision on Cleaning Up and Rectifying Companies" by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, various regions and departments have conducted a cleanup of Party and state cadres holding positions in companies (enterprises). A number of Party and state cadres have resigned from their positions in companies (enterprises) or from their government jobs. However, a significant number of Party and state cadres still hold positions in companies (enterprises). To thoroughly implement the "Decision on Cleaning Up and Rectifying Companies" by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, and to ensure the smooth progress of the cleanup and rectification of companies, the following supplementary notice is issued:

1. Party and state cadres who are currently holding positions in companies (enterprises) must resign from their company (enterprise) positions or from their government jobs by March 31, 1989. If they insist on remaining in their company (enterprise) positions, the personnel departments should remove them from their government jobs and transfer their personnel, salary, and other related matters to the companies (enterprises) where they are employed. This includes cadres who have left their government positions but have not yet completed retirement (separation) procedures.

2. Party and state cadres with production management experience or specialized technical skills who hold positions in production, technical development, consulting, or service companies must also resign from their government jobs or from their company (enterprise) positions.

3. Party and state cadres who hold positions in non-profit labor service companies established within their own departments to improve backend services and facilitate the lives of employees may continue to serve. Those who hold positions in profit-making labor service companies established within Party and state departments, which have been approved to remain after inspection, must resign from their company positions or from their government jobs.

4. Party and state cadres are not allowed to hold positions in Sino-foreign joint ventures. A few who are currently holding positions in enterprises due to contractual obligations may submit a special report for review and approval according to the cadre management authority. They may temporarily remain in their positions until the contract expires, at which point they must resign from their enterprise positions. During this period, they are not allowed to receive remuneration from the enterprise.

5. Party and state cadres who have reached retirement (separation) age must handle retirement (separation) procedures according to the relevant regulations of the Central Committee and the State Council. Those who are in good health and have management experience and specialized technical skills, if needed to take up positions in companies (enterprises), should follow the "Several Provisions on Retired (Separated) Cadres of County-Level and Above Party and State Organs Engaging in Business and Running Enterprises" issued by the General Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the General Office of the State Council.

6. Cadres working in companies, public institutions, railways, postal services, specialized banks, insurance companies, and other units with government administrative functions should also follow the above regulations.

7. Various regions and departments should, according to cadre management authority, conduct a cleanup of Party and state cadres holding positions in companies (enterprises) one by one, complete the procedures for resigning from company (enterprise) positions or detaching from government jobs by the deadline, and report the cleanup situation to the higher-level cadre management departments.

8. In the future, Party committees and governments at all levels will no longer approve Party and state cadres holding positions in companies (enterprises). For newly established companies (enterprises) with Party and state cadres holding positions, the industrial and commercial administrative departments will not handle the approval and registration procedures.

　　中央办公厅、国务院办公厅发出通知    
    党政干部限三月底前辞去公司兼职    
    对坚持在公司任职的干部主管部门应免去其机关职务
    新华社北京２月１２日电  中共中央办公厅、国务院办公厅关于清理党和国家机关干部在公司（企业）兼职有关问题的通知。
    （１９８９年２月５日）
    中共中央、国务院《关于清理整顿公司的决定》发出后，各地区、各部门对党和国家机关干部在公司（企业）的兼职进行了清理，已有一批党和国家机关干部辞去了公司（企业）职务，或者辞去了机关职务。但是，还有相当数量的党和国家机关干部仍在公司（企业）兼职。为了认真贯彻落实中共中央、国务院《关于清理整顿公司的决定》，保证清理整顿公司工作的顺利进行，现对清理党和国家机关干部在公司（企业）兼职的有关问题补充通知如下：
    一、已到公司（企业）兼职的党和国家机关干部，必须在１９８９年３月底以前辞去公司（企业）职务，或辞去机关职务。如本人坚持在公司（企业）任职，干部主管部门应免去其机关职务，并将人事、工资等各项关系转到所在公司（企业）。这里所指的党和国家机关干部，包括已退出机关工作岗位，但未办理退（离）休手续的干部（下同）。
    二、党和国家机关中具有生产管理经验、专业技术特长的干部，到生产、技术开发、咨询、服务性公司兼职的，也必须辞去机关职务，或辞去公司（企业）职务。
    三、在本机关为改善后勤服务工作、方便职工生活而开办的非经营性劳动服务公司兼职的党和国家机关干部，可以继续留任；在党和国家机关开办的、经清查允许保留的经营性劳动服务公司兼职的党和国家机关干部，必须辞去公司职务，或辞去机关职务。
    四、党和国家机关干部不得到中外合资企业兼职。少数如因履行职务聘任合同，现在辞去企业职务会影响履行对外合同的，可写出专题报告，按干部管理权限审查批准后，暂时留任。一俟聘任合同到期，应即辞去企业兼职。兼职期间不得领取兼职企业的报酬。
    五、党和国家机关干部，凡已到退（离）休年龄的，都应按中央、国务院有关规定办理退（离）休手续。身体健康、具有经营管理经验和专业技术特长的干部，如需到公司（企业）任职，按中共中央办公厅、国务院办公厅《关于县以上党和国家机关退（离）休干部经商办企业问题的若干规定》执行。
    六、在兼有政府行政管理职能的公司、事业单位及铁路、邮电、专业银行、保险公司等单位工作的干部，也应按照上述规定执行。
    七、各地区、各部门要按照干部管理权限，对在公司（企业）兼职的党和国家机关干部，逐个进行清理，按期办完其辞去公司（企业）职务手续或与机关脱钩的手续，并将清理情况逐级上报干部主管部门。
    八、今后，各级党委、政府不再审批党和国家机关干部到公司（企业）兼职。新成立的公司（企业），凡有党和国家机关干部兼职的，工商行政管理部门不予办理审批注册手续。
