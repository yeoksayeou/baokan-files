The Zhangjiakou Municipal Government in Hebei Province established a special mail system for National People's Congress (NPC) representatives and Political Consultative Conference (PCC) members to participate in politics and offer suggestions since May last year. So far, 194 pieces of advice have been received.

The special mail system for participating in politics and offering suggestions is established to fully utilize the supervisory role of NPC representatives and PCC members in government work and to further broaden democratic channels. The municipal government has uniformly printed special envelopes and stationery for this purpose and distributed them to 609 municipal and above NPC representatives and PCC members. They can submit their suggestions and opinions on the government's work at any time using the one-letter-per-issue method. The government will handle urgent issues immediately and respond to general issues within two months.

One PCC member collected a large amount of historical materials to discuss the role of Zhangjiakou as a commercial and trade hub. Based on his understanding of the development of border trade in some remote areas and the feedback on Chinese goods in Mongolia, he suggested to the municipal government to strengthen economic exchanges with Erlianhaote City in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region to promote the development of border trade. The municipal government conducted a serious study of this letter and sent a deputy mayor and a deputy chairman of the municipal PCC to Erlianhaote City for economic investigations. They conducted extensive negotiations on establishing a window and conducting barter trade with Mongolia, and both sides agreed on several economic cooperation projects. Since the establishment of the special mail system, NPC representatives and PCC members have provided nearly a hundred pieces of valuable information on product development, technology introduction, fund circulation, talent exchange, and the development of the tertiary industry.

Some NPC representatives and PCC members used the mail system to report on individual government officials who, during their inspections at the grassroots level, insisted on extravagant meals and accepted gifts. After verifying the facts, the municipal government conducted a rectification campaign for the government's work style and publicly criticized the relevant personnel. The municipal government also issued "Several Regulations on Strictly Enforcing Government Discipline and Strengthening Political Integrity." Government leaders took the lead in complying with the requirements of the "Regulations," gradually forming a clean and honest atmosphere.

　　建立人大代表政协委员专用信函联系制度    
    张家口市加强政务监督
    本报讯  河北省张家口市人民政府自去年５月建立人大代表、政协委员参政议政专用信函联系制度以来，已收到各种建议１９４件。
    参政议政专用信函联系制度，是为了充分发挥人大代表、政协委员对政府工作的监督作用，进一步拓宽民主渠道而建立的。市政府统一印制了参政议政专用信封和信笺，发放到６０９名市以上人大代表、政协委员手中。他们对市政府的工作建议、意见，采取一事一函办法，随时提出、寄送。政府对于信函中的紧急问题当即处理，一般问题在两个月之内必作答复。
    一位市政协委员通过收集大量史料，阐述了张家口市在商业贸易中的旱码头作用。同时，他根据自己对一些边远地区发展边境贸易情况的了解及我国商品在蒙古人民共和国的反映等信息，向市政府提出了加强与内蒙古自治区二连浩特市的经济往来，促进边境贸易发展的建议。市政府对这封信函进行了认真的研究，并选派一名副市长与市政协副主席带领有关人员，赴二连浩特市进行经济考察，围绕在该市建立窗口、开展与蒙古人民共和国换货贸易等事宜进行了广泛洽谈，双方还确定了一些经济协作项目。自建立专用信函联系制度以来，市人大代表、政协委员就产品开发、技术引进、资金融通、人才交流及发展第三产业等方面，提供了近百条价值较高的信息。
    有些人大代表、政协委员对个别政府工作人员下基层检查工作时讲究吃喝、收受礼品等现象，利用信函及时向政府举报。市政府在核查事实后，开展机关作风整顿，对有关人员公开批评。市政府还作出了《关于严肃机关纪律、加强政风建设的几项规定》。政府领导带头遵守《规定》中各项要求，逐渐形成清正廉洁的好风气。
