	International opinion has been closely following the visit of Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze to Beijing. Many countries' media outlets have published numerous reports and articles, noting that this visit further prepares for the first high-level meeting between China and the Soviet Union in 30 years. They welcome the normalization of Sino-Soviet relations, viewing it as a significant international event for the year.

	The Japanese news agency Kyodo reported that the normalization of Sino-Soviet relations "will bring a new political order to international relations," and "will further strengthen the global trend from tension to relaxation and from confrontation to dialogue." It will also "promote world peace and stability." A Japanese Foreign Ministry official welcomed the results of the talks between the two countries' foreign ministers, stating that the normalization of relations will have a positive impact on resolving issues such as Cambodia. The American newspaper Chicago Tribune quoted a Western diplomat in Beijing as saying that the normalization of Sino-Soviet relations is beneficial to the United States and will not weaken American interests. The British newspaper The Guardian emphasized that after the normalization of Sino-Soviet relations, "it is no longer necessary for one corner of the U.S., Soviet, and Chinese triangle to be opposed to the other two."

	The media in Eastern European countries also generally welcome Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's upcoming visit to China. The East German newspaper Berliner Zeitung pointed out that reaching an agreement on the Sino-Soviet summit meeting is of "great significance." A Bulgarian individual stated that the normalization of Sino-Soviet relations is not only beneficial to the peoples of China and the Soviet Union but also has "special significance" for Bulgaria.

	Meanwhile, international opinion also noted that there are still differences between China and the Soviet Union on the Cambodian issue, which requires further consultation.

	Moscow, February 5 (Xinhua) - Today, the Soviet newspaper Pravda published an article after Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze concluded his visit to China. The article pointed out that both the Soviet Union and China hope that the talks between Gorbachev and Deng Xiaoping and other Chinese leaders will lead to the complete normalization of Sino-Soviet relations, opening a new chapter in the history of the two neighboring countries.

	The article, written by the newspaper's political observer Ovchinnikov, believes that the normalization of relations between the two countries is a need of the peoples of China and the Soviet Union.

	The article believes that the two large countries, China and the Soviet Union, have a special responsibility for human survival, reforming international relations, and establishing a new world political order. The specific goals are disarmament, Asian security, resolving regional conflicts, and addressing global issues.

	The article states that the theme of Sino-Soviet dialogue is peace and development. The normalization of Sino-Soviet relations is a component of establishing a new international relations system, which will be beneficial to the health of regional and global situations.
