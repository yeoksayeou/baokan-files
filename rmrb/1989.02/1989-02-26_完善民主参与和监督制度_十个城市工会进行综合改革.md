The All-China Federation of Trade Unions has selected 10 major and medium-sized cities to pilot a comprehensive reform of urban trade unions, aiming to further improve the trade unions' democratic participation in government and social affairs and their social supervision systems.

The 10 cities are Dan Dong, Wei Fang, Chang Zhou, Heng Yang, Zhu Zhou, An Yang, Qing Dao, and Wu Han, where industrial workers are relatively concentrated.

The purpose of the comprehensive reform of urban trade unions is to ensure that trade union organizations, as representatives of workers, have sufficient voice in major political and social events in the future.

In addition, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and trade unions at the provincial, municipal, and autonomous region levels will select 1,000 grassroots trade unions nationwide to pilot the activation of grassroots trade union organizations and strengthen grassroots trade union activities.

It is understood that in the future, the state will pay more attention to the political and social status and legal rights and interests of the vast number of workers, and this attention will be implemented mainly through the workers' own organization—the trade unions. To this end, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions requires local areas to build grassroots trade unions into organizations that can truly represent the will of the workers, work independently and autonomously in a complex web of contradictions, and be trusted by the masses of workers.

　　完善民主参与和监督制度
    十个城市工会进行综合改革
    据新华社北京２月２５日电  （记者黄晓南、徐克洪）中华全国总工会已选定１０个大中城市进行城市工会综合改革的试点，以期进一步完善工会对政府和社会事务的民主参与和社会监督制度。
    这１０个大中城市是产业工人较为集中的丹东、潍坊、常州、衡阳、株洲、安阳、青岛、武汉等。
    进行城市工会综合改革的目的在于使作为工人代表的工会组织在未来的重大政治、社会生活中有足够的发言权。
    此外，全总和各省、市、自治区工会还将在全国选择１０００个基层工会进行活跃基层工会组织、加强基层工会活动的试点。
    据了解，今后国家将对广大职工的政治、社会地位及其合法利益给予更多的关注，而这种关注的具体实施将主要通过工人自己的组织——工会来实现。为此，全总要求各地把基层工会建设成为能够在错综复杂的矛盾中，真正代表职工意愿，独立自主开展工作，深受职工群众信赖的组织。
