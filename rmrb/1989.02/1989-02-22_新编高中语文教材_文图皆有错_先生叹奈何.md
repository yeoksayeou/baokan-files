Title: Errors in Text and Illustrations in Newly Compiled Senior High School Language Textbooks
Author: Sū Píngzhōu
Date: 1989-02-22
Edition: 5

In our teaching, we found that the unified edition of middle school language textbooks used starting in the autumn of 1988 have too many printing errors. Taking the first volume of senior high school language textbooks as an example, we found thirteen errors:

On page 154, the fifth line from the bottom, "1968" should be "1978" according to the content of the lesson. The period before the character "从" should be a comma. On page 167, the second line from the top should have a parenthesis that is missing. On page 180, the last line of the lesson text, "立万米" should be "立方米". On page 184, the first line from the top, the number "三" should be "二". On page 270, the fifth line from the bottom in the notes, the sentence "没有人可以" should have a period after the character "人". On page 280, the twelfth line from the bottom, the three characters "不得已" should not be followed by a comma (see the requirements of question four to understand). On page 302, in the "Preparation Tips," the last line should be "碑扑道" instead of "仆碑道". On page 306, in the table, "华" and "在" are incorrectly pronounced, it should be "华" and "花" are incorrectly pronounced. On page 354, in the "Thinking and Practice" first question, the first group of sentences, the second sentence, "上此" should be "上世". On page 359, in the notes (4), the character "暇" is mistakenly written as "睱".

Furthermore, the illustration in the article "The Seagull" is incorrect. The text clearly states, "The sea waves are as calm as the West Lake in spring, with only a slight breeze blowing up countless tiny ripples," "The water surface appears gentle and pleasant," "The sea water, struck by the seagull's scissor-like tail and wing tips, still ripples in several circular waves," "The sea water remains flat and calm." However, the illustration shows towering waves and turbulent sea water, which is inconsistent with the overall tone of the article, indicating that the illustrator did not correctly understand the original text. Moreover, the seagull is drawn like a mosquito.

We hope that the newly compiled textbooks will continue to improve, as they directly affect students' learning. This is a matter of great importance!

　　新编高中语文教材
    文图皆有错　先生叹奈何
    我们在教学中，发现一九八八年秋季开始使用的统编中学语文教材排印错误太多，以高中语文第一册为例，我们发现的就有十三处：
    一百五十四页倒数第五行的“一九六八年”，根据课文内容看，应是一九七八年。这一行的“从”字前头的句号应为逗号。一百六十七页顺数第二行后应有括号而没有。一百八十页课文的倒数第一行的“立万米”应为“立方米”。一百八十四页顺数第一行的番号“三”应为“二”。二百七十页注释的倒数第五行“没有人可以”句，应在“人”字后边加句号。二百八十页倒数第十二行“不得已”，三字连逗号应去掉（请看第四题的要求一便知）。三百零二页的“预习提示”的倒数第一行“仆碑道”应为“碑扑道”。三百零六页的表格中“华”“在”音谬，应为“华”“花”音谬。三百五十四页的“思考和练习”第一题的第一组句子中的第二句，“上此”应为“上世”。三百五十九页的注释（四）将“暇”字错为“睱”字。
    再者，《海燕》一文的插图有错。课文明明说了“海波是平稳得如春晨的西湖一样，偶有微风，只吹起了绝细绝细的千万个粼粼的小绉纹”，“水面显得温秀可喜”，“海水被它的似剪的尾与翼尖一打，也仍是连漾了好几圈圆晕”，“海水仍是平贴无波”，但插图却是骇浪惊天，海水动荡，这与全文的基调很不一致，可见插图作者没有正确领会原文。而且那海燕画得像蚊子。
    新编教材，我们希望它日臻完善，因为它直接影响学生的学习，这是何等慎重的事啊！
