The Panchen Erdeni Qojye Gyaincain, the Panchen Lama, passed away suddenly due to a heart attack, and the Communist Party of China lost a loyal friend. I lost a close friend with whom I had worked together for 40 years.

For 40 years, I have built a deep friendship with the Lama. Just before he went to Tibet to preside over the consecration ceremony of the Eastern Tomb of the Panchen Lamas in Zhashi Nangje, he took the time to come and say goodbye to me and presented me with a white khata. It was his old habit to say goodbye before leaving and to have a heart-to-heart talk upon returning. I understand his character—he is passionate, easily excited, and when working, he cannot control himself. I told him that the oxygen level in Tibet is very low during this season, and he should take care of his health, not be impatient, and balance work and rest. He said, "Once this matter is completed, my greatest wish will be fulfilled, and even if I die, I will be at peace." I said, "Buddha does not want you to leave, and Marx does not want you to leave either." Who would have thought that the Lama's departure would be forever? Holding the pure white khata he gave me before leaving, I looked towards the west, overwhelmed with grief.

The Lama often said that he had loved the Communist Party since he was a child and had deep feelings for the Party. He said, "Without the leadership of the Communist Party of China, there would be no Tibet today." From my long-term interactions with him, I deeply felt that his feelings were very sincere, and his entire life's practice fully demonstrated this.

As an outstanding representative of the Tibetan people and a great leader of Tibetan Buddhism, the Lama always linked the fate and future of the Tibetan people with the fate and future of the country, and with the leadership of the Communist Party of China. From the eve of the victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War to various historical periods since the founding of New China, the Lama has sincerely supported the correct proposals of the Communist Party on many major issues.

In September 1949, after the liberation of Xining, the Lama immediately sent people to contact the Communist Party of China. At that time, Vice Marshal Peng Dehuai and I were responsible for the work of the Northwest Bureau and had contact with the Lama. On October 1, 1949, the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Lama sent a telegram to Chairman Mao Zedong and Marshal Zhu De, celebrating the birth of New China and expressing his "support and admiration" for the Communist Party of China, supporting the Communist Party of China's abolition of the system of national oppression and implementation of the policy of national equality. He firmly believed that under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, "the liberation of Tibet is imminent." Chairman Mao Zedong and Marshal Zhu De replied, encouraging the Lama and hoping that he and the patriotic people of Tibet would work together to strive for the liberation of Tibet and the unity of the Han and Tibetan peoples. In June 1950, the Lama sent his representative, Cai Jinmei, to Xi'an to see Marshal Peng and proposed suggestions on the methods of liberating Tibet. At that time, I accompanied Marshal Peng to meet with Cai Jinmei and his delegation, warmly supporting the Lama's patriotic actions and thanking him for his trust in our Party. We also sent a letter to the Lama, hoping that "the people of Tibet will soon return to the friendly and cooperative family of the People's Republic of China and enjoy an equal, peaceful, and happy new life." The Central Committee of the Party and Chairman Mao highly valued the Lama's suggestions on the methods of liberating Tibet, believing them to be very good and in line with the spirit of patriotism and unity.

My first meeting with the Lama was on a mid-April day in 1951. At that time, he led the officials of the Panchen Lama's Tashilhunpo Monastery to Beijing via Xi'an, and I represented the Northwest Bureau and the Northwest Military and Political Committee to welcome him at the airport. When he stepped off the plane, a lively and handsome young Tibetan incarnation appeared before me. At the bottom of the airplane stairs, he firmly shook my hand and said excitedly, "We are specially going to Beijing to pay our respects to Chairman Mao! I will personally convey the good wishes of the Tibetan people to Chairman Mao." At the welcome ceremony, he expressed his firm support for the Central People's Government and his determination to work with patriotic people from all walks of life in Tibet to strive for the liberation of Tibet and the unity of the Tibetan people. "Age is not a factor in having aspirations," his patriotism and frank, generous character left a deep impression on me.

In the spring of 1951, the pro-imperialist regent, the Great Fifth, was overthrown, and the Dalai Lama took power. On January 27, the Dalai Lama sent a letter to the Central Committee, reporting his assumption of power and expressing his desire for peace. The Central Committee replied, congratulating him on his assumption of power and welcoming him to send representatives to Beijing for talks. On April 22, the delegation led by Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, the chief plenipotentiary, arrived in Beijing. On April 27, the delegation led by the Lama arrived in Beijing. The Lama sincerely supported the Central Government's policy of peaceful liberation of Tibet and expressed his intention to unite the various forces of the Tibetan people to promote the implementation of this policy. After several rounds of negotiations between the full powers of the Central People's Government, including Li Weihan, and the representatives of the local Tibetan government, with the response and efforts of the Dalai Lama and the Lama, the historic "Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet" was signed in Beijing on May 23, 1951. The next afternoon, the Lama led the main officials of the Panchen Lama's Tashilhunpo Monastery to pay their respects to Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, presenting him with a silk banner written in Tibetan and Chinese that read, "The Great Savior of the People of All Nationalities in China." That evening, Chairman Mao held a banquet to celebrate the signing of the agreement and gave a speech. On May 28, the Lama and the officials of the Panchen Lama's Tashilhunpo Monastery issued a statement with "indescribable excitement," saying that the signing of the agreement "announced the failure of imperialist aggression against Tibet, the unity of the Tibetan people with the people of all nationalities in China, the unity within the Tibetan people, and the beginning of a new era in the history of the Tibetan people." The statement expressed "deep respect" for the Dalai Lama's response to the Central Government's call to send representatives to Beijing for talks and sign the agreement. During this period, the Lama also sent a telegram to the Dalai Lama, expressing his willingness to "spare no effort" and "work together sincerely" with the Dalai Lama to help him and the local Tibetan government fully implement the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet. At the same time, the Lama sent a telegram to the political and religious officials and monks and laypeople of the Zhashi Lhunpo Monastery in Tibet, hoping that they would unite under the leadership of the Central People's Government and Chairman Mao to "fully implement this agreement, actively support the PLA units entering Tibet, and drive out the imperialist forces of aggression in Tibet."

On December 15, 1951, before the Lama returned to Tibet from Xining, Qinghai, I was entrusted by the Central Committee to represent Chairman Mao, the Central People's Government, and the Northwest Military and Political Committee to go to Xining to see him off. The Lama and his officials sent a welcoming procession of monks. At a welcoming ceremony attended by more than 1,000 people from various ethnic groups, the Lama gave a passionate speech. He said excitedly, "Without the correct leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao and the sincere help of the brotherly nationalities of China, the peaceful liberation of Tibet would have been impossible, and our return to Tibet would have been impossible. Therefore, we say that the Communist Party and Chairman Mao are the great saviors of the Tibetan people, our great benefactors. We can only follow the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, only unite closely with the brotherly nationalities of the motherland, and then the Tibetan people can achieve complete liberation. There is no other way." The Lama's words were sincere and heartfelt. His predecessor, the Ninth Panchen Lama, due to a falling out with the Thirteenth Dalai Lama, was forced to leave Tibet and wandered in the interior for 26 years until his death, never able to return to Tibet. Now, the wish to return to Tibet and the monastery was finally realized by the Tenth Panchen Lama, Qojye Gyaincain. His joy and excitement were very natural.

During this meeting, we had a cordial conversation. I said, "After you return to Tibet, don't be in a hurry. You should consider the overall situation and first do a good job of uniting the Tibetan people. Only then will there be hope for all aspects of work in Tibet." I also, based on the spirit of the Central Committee, instructed the responsible comrades we sent to accompany the Lama to Tibet on two points: first, all work in Tibet should follow the policy of being cautious and steady, and things that are not ripe should not be done, and things that are not agreed upon by the upper-level patriotic people and leaders should not be done. Second, the work in Tibet should focus on the anti-imperialist, patriotic, and united front. Looking back, the spirit of the Central Committee is still meaningful today.

In April 1952, when the Lama returned to Tibet and arrived in the northern Tibetan town of Nagqu, two acting dzongpons, Lukangwa and Losang Zaxi, who were sent by the local Tibetan government, incited a fake people's congress in Lhasa to oppose the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet. The Lama was very indignant and sent a telegram to the Dalai Lama, demanding that the Dalai Lama "with great wisdom and courage, and great compassion and Buddhist light" seriously handle this serious incident that undermined national unity, undermined the unity of the Tibetan people, and especially undermined the prestige of the Dalai Lama's political and religious authority. Finally, the Dalai Lama issued a decree to dissolve the fake people's congress and revoke the positions of acting dzongpons held by Lukangwa and Losang Zaxi. On April 28, the Lama arrived in Lhasa. After arriving in Lhasa, he reached an understanding with the Dalai Lama, and they exchanged khatas.

In September 1954, the Lama and the Dalai Lama jointly attended the first session of the First National People's Congress in Beijing. At that time, I was already working in the Central Committee. From then until 1962, I was entrusted by the Central Committee to be responsible for maintaining contact with the Lama, and our relationship became closer, and our friendship deepened.

The Lama, as a loyal friend of our Party, is particularly evident in his ability to actively propose constructive opinions, suggestions, and even sharp criticisms to the Party. He is straightforward and frank, speaking without reservation. I understand this very well and think it is very rare. I always feel that having such a friend is a fortunate thing. Because of this understanding, I also treat him with sincerity and openness. I often tell him, "For the cause of the Party and the people, for the unity and stability of the country, we two can say anything. If I make a mistake, you criticize me, and if you make a mistake, I criticize you. We should seek truth from facts." I know he is impatient and even gets angry when things happen, but he is not a stubborn person. He pursues truth throughout his life, discards evil and promotes good, always listens to correct opinions, listens attentively, and acts seriously. I often tell him, "Speaking out is right, but don't be impatient. Good things can't be done all at once, and don't get angry." He said, "You are my old friend and good friend. You understand me. You are doing this for my good, and I am very happy."

The Lama cared about the development and progress of Tibetan society throughout his life and actively supported the democratic reforms in Tibet. In 1956, when the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region was established, it was proposed to carry out democratic reform pilot projects in the areas under the jurisdiction of the Panchen Lama's Tashilhunpo Monastery to gain experience and then promote it to the entire region. The Central Committee, based on the actual situation in Tibet, believed that the conditions for democratic reform were not ripe and announced the policy of "no reform for six years." The Lama followed the Central Committee's opinion and did not carry out the pilot project. In March 1959, the upper-class reactionary clique in Tibet, in order to maintain the feudal serf system, opposed reforms, and publicly tore up the 17-point agreement, launching a full-scale armed rebellion. In view of this situation, the State Council ordered the dissolution of the original local Tibetan government, and the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region exercised the powers of the local government, appointing the Lama as the acting chairman of the committee, and determining the policy of suppressing the rebellion while carrying out reforms. The Lama sent a telegram to Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou, expressing his support for the State Council's order and decision, and at the same time sent a telegram to the Tibet Work Committee and the Military Region, saying, "I have instructed the Panchen Lama's Tashilhunpo Monastery to now continue to strengthen unity and cooperation with the Preparatory Committee and the PLA, make good preparations, and ensure the safety of Shigatse City, and jointly crush and suppress the rebellion." On April 8, the Lama presided over the Preparatory Committee and called for the suppression of the rebellion. On April 22, 1960, the Preparatory Committee held its fourth meeting, and the Lama, in his summary report, highly praised the great significance of suppressing the rebellion and carrying out reforms, pointing out: "1959 is 'a year of decisive victory for the Tibetan people'."

The suppression of the rebellion and the reforms in Tibet were a great revolution for the progress of Tibetan society and the liberation of the people. However, in the later period, there were "leftist" deviations. The Lama was very dissatisfied with this and went to Beijing to report the situation to the Central Committee. Chairman Mao, Premier Zhou, and Comrade Li Weihan all listened to the Lama's opinions. Chairman Mao praised the Lama's good style of speaking the truth and affirmed and encouraged some of his good opinions. During this period, the Central Committee sent Comrade Yang Jingren to Tibet to investigate. On January 5, 1961, after listening to Comrade Yang Jingren's report, Comrade Xiaoping instructed that after the democratic reforms in Tibet, it was necessary to prevent "leftist" tendencies and prevent impatience, and determined the policy of stability and development in Tibet for five years without establishing cooperatives. On January 24, Premier Zhou, in a conversation with the Lama and Comrade Zhang Jingwu, pointed out: "The policy and principles of Tibet can be summarized as: the land ownership system is individual peasant ownership, and this system should continue for many years. The focus is on increasing production, and this policy should be firmly implemented." After that, the Lama returned to Tibet to take charge of the work and visited other Tibetan areas. In May 1962, he submitted a "70,000-word letter" to the State Council, systematically proposing his criticisms and suggestions on the work in Tibet and other Tibetan areas. The Central Committee and the State Council attached great importance to this and believed that most of the Lama's opinions and suggestions were good, but some were excessive. I was entrusted by Premier Zhou to visit the Lama several times and talk with him. He was very angry and said some harsh words. I fully affirmed his precious spirit of daring to speak the truth to the Party and at the same time advised him not to get angry and not to say angry words. After a while, he calmed down and said, "I accept what you say. You have watched me grow up since I was young and have always helped me. You represent the Party, and as an individual, you are a friend. You are doing this for my good, and I am grateful, but some things that should not be said have already been said. I will pay attention in the future, but I explain that I am sincerely good for the Party." The Lama is such a transparent master. Later, I and Comrade Li Weihan, Vice Chairman Apho, and others had candid exchanges of opinions with the Lama. After joint research, four good documents aimed at correcting "leftist" tendencies and preventing impatience in Tibet's work were produced and reported to the State Council for approval. Unfortunately, after the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, due to the influence of "leftist" guiding ideology, these four documents were not implemented. The Lama and Li Weihan, including myself, were criticized for this. Since then, my contact with the Lama was interrupted for more than ten years. During the Cultural Revolution, the Lama, like many Party and state leaders, was severely persecuted. Despite this, the Lama never wavered in his firm belief in the Party and the motherland.

After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, I was able to meet the Lama again. Old friends meeting again, we had a lot to say. The Lama saw me and said anxiously, "Because of my '70,000-word letter,' you were implicated, and I am truly sorry." I said, "This is not a matter of who implicated whom. We have all been tempered and tested, and our knowledge has increased. The Party understands you."

After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, the Lama firmly supported the Party Central Committee's rectification of wrongs and spared no effort to assist the Party Central Committee in implementing various policies. The Party Central Committee also gave the Lama full trust. In 1980, before the Lama's inspection tour of the Tibetan areas, Comrade Xiaoping invited him to his home and warmly said, "You are the best patriot in our country," "You can act freely in your own activities, don't worry," "When you go down this time, you can say that the things that happened during the Cultural Revolution were all wrong. You don't have to be afraid, just say that this is what the central leaders said." The Lama was greatly encouraged after hearing this and trusted the Party even more. To make up for the lost time, he often worked and studied day and night.

At the end of 1980, after I returned to the Central Committee from Guangdong, I was again in charge of ethnic, religious, and united front work. We had more opportunities to interact, and our friendship became even stronger. As a state leader and religious leader, the Lama's tasks were more arduous and his work more busy during this period. Despite this, the time we spent meeting and interacting did not decrease, and our habit of being candid with each other remained the same. Every time he went on an inspection tour, went abroad, or conducted other major activities, I always reminded him: first, to pay attention to his health and safety; second, to stay calm when things happen and not to get angry. Every time he returned, he would come to talk to me, and we would talk about everything. For every success of his, I was genuinely moved and happy, and I supported him without reservation. Of course, for the places I thought he was not yet sufficient, I also pointed them out without hesitation. When he thought I was wrong, he would also argue with me or reserve his own opinion. In 1985, the Lama strongly criticized the Henan Provincial Government for handing over Shaolin Temple to the Songshan Administration Bureau and wanted "to make a fuss about this matter until it is settled and the truth is revealed." I saw this material and immediately pointed out, "It is commendable to grasp the implementation of policies, but don't be too angry," "It is appropriate for Shaolin Temple to be managed by monks and nuns," "If it is delayed, send a high-ranking official to investigate the reason? Or ask the Lama to personally supervise?" In the end, this matter was properly resolved, and the Lama was very happy.

As an outstanding leader of Tibetan Buddhism, the Lama loved his religion; as an outstanding representative of the Tibetan people, he loved his nation; as a great patriot, he loved his country; as a loyal friend of the Party, he loved the Communist Party of China. He perfectly united the love for his religion, his nation, and his country and the Party. This is the epitome of the Lama's life.

The Lama loved the Communist Party of China and became a loyal friend of the Party, stemming from his deep understanding of the fate and future of his own nation, his deep understanding of the Party's policies and principles, and his profound study of history and reality. In 1982, at a cadre conference in Lhasa, Tibet, he gave a long speech systematically describing the historical relationship between Tibet and the motherland and conclusively arguing that "Tibet has become an inseparable part of the great motherland through long-term historical development, which is an undeniable historical fact. In reality, the development and progress of Tibet in the 30 years since its peaceful liberation have surpassed several hundred or even a thousand years in history, which is another undeniable fact. History and reality tell us that Tibet has a brilliant future only under the leadership of the Communist Party of China in the socialist family of the motherland; only the Tibetan people have a prosperous and developed future; only by maintaining the unity of the motherland, strengthening the great unity between the Han and Tibetan peoples and among all nationalities in the motherland, and under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, can we firmly walk the socialist road and have a truly happy and fulfilling future." "The lessons of history have taught us that loving the motherland and loving the nation are one, and the two cannot be separated, let alone opposed. Now, some people try to use the remnants of national estrangement left over from history to use love for the nation to deny love for the motherland, using the banner of the nation to oppose the motherland. We should be highly vigilant against this and expose their hypocrisy in the name of loving the nation in time." He also said, "Insisting on the consistency of national interests with state interests, insisting on the position of loving the motherland and the nation, is the only correct position, and it can become a bright, fearless, and beneficial person for the people." Regarding religion, the Lama inherited the tradition of the founder of the Yellow Sect, Tsongkhapa, insisting on reform, promoting good and eliminating evil, starting from the benefit of the people, studying and exploring the experience of the adaptation of religion and socialism, combining the Buddhist teaching of "glorifying the country and benefiting all sentient beings" with patriotism, and coordinating the Buddhist teaching of "universal salvation" with the purpose of serving the people. He encouraged believers to unite around the Party, striving together to build the Four Modernizations and revitalize China.

From these years of interaction, I deeply felt that my close friend, the Lama, had become more mature. Last year, we celebrated the Lama's "knowing the mandate of heaven" year, wishing the Lama to achieve more brilliant achievements for the country and the nation. As Comrade Xiaoping said to him, "You still have thoughts, analysis, and ability. I hope you will make more contributions to the motherland." However, our Lama has left us! This loss is indeed irreparable.

We mourn the Lama's passing and hope for his rebirth. We will complete the Lama's unfinished business, make new contributions to maintaining the unity of the motherland and national unity, building a united, prosperous, and civilized socialist new Tibet, and promoting the common prosperity of all nationalities.

The loyal friend of our Party, the Lama, will be immortal!

　　深切怀念中国共产党的忠诚朋友班禅大师
    习仲勋
    班禅额尔德尼·确吉坚赞大师因心脏病突发，溘然长逝，中国共产党失去了一位忠诚朋友，我失去了一位合作共事４０个春秋的知心朋友。
    ４０年来，我和大师建立了深厚的友情。就在这次他去西藏主持班禅东陵扎什南捷开光典礼前，还在百忙中来向我告别并献了哈达。出门要告别，回来要谈心，这是他长期同我交往的一个老习惯了。我了解他的性格，热情高，爱激动，工作起来控制不住自己。我对他说，这个季节西藏缺氧严重，你要注意自己的身体，不要性急，要劳逸结合。他说，这件事办完遂了我最大的心愿，就是死了也瞑目。我说，佛不要你走，马克思也不要你走。谁知大师一去，竟成永诀。我捧着他临行前赠我的洁白的哈达，遥望西天，悲恸万分。
    班禅大师生前一再说，他从幼年起就热爱共产党，对党怀有深厚的感情。他说，没有中国共产党的领导，就没有今天的西藏。从我同他长期的交往中，深深感到，他的这种感情是非常诚挚的，他一生的实践也充分说明了这一点。
    班禅大师作为藏民族的优秀代表和藏传佛教的杰出领袖，始终把藏民族的命运和前途同祖国的命运和前途联系在一起，同中国共产党的领导联系在一起。从中国人民解放战争取得胜利的前夜到新中国成立以来的各个历史时期，班禅大师都竭诚地拥护中国共产党在许多重大问题上的正确主张。
    １９４９年９月西宁解放后，班禅大师即派人同中国共产党联系。当时彭德怀副总司令和我负责西北局的工作，同班禅大师有了联系。１９４９年１０月１日，中华人民共和国成立，班禅大师致电毛泽东主席和朱德总司令，欢呼新中国的诞生，满腔热情地表示对中国共产党的“拥护爱戴之忱”，拥护中国共产党废除民族压迫制度，实行民族平等的政策，坚信在中国共产党的领导下，“西藏解放，指日可待”。毛泽东主席和朱德总司令复电勉慰班禅大师，希望大师和西藏爱国人士一致努力，为西藏的解放和汉藏民族的团结而奋斗。１９５０年６月，班禅大师派他的代表计晋美等专程来西安见彭总，提出有关解放西藏办法的建议。当时我陪彭总会见了计晋美一行，热情支持班禅大师的爱国义举，感谢他对我们党的信赖。我们还致函班禅大师，希望“西藏人民早日回到中华人民共和国友爱合作的大家庭，享受平等、安乐、幸福的新生活”。党中央和毛主席十分重视班禅大师关于解放西藏办法的建议，认为很好，是合乎爱国与团结精神的。
    我第一次与班禅大师见面是１９５１年４月中旬的一天。那时他率领班禅堪布会议厅官员赴京途经西安，我代表西北局和西北军政委员会到机场迎接。当他走下飞机时，一个活脱脱的英俊藏族少年活佛形象出现在我的眼前。在飞机舷梯下，他紧紧握住我的手，心情激动地对我说：我们是专程去北京向毛主席致敬的！我要把藏族人民对中央人民政府和毛主席的良好祝愿亲口转达给毛主席。在欢迎会上，他表示坚决拥护中央人民政府，决心与西藏各界爱国人士一道为西藏的解放和藏族人民的团结努力奋斗。“有志不在年高”，他的爱国热情和坦诚豪爽的性格给我留下了深刻的印象。
    １９５１年春，亲帝国主义分子大扎摄政下台，达赖喇嘛亲政。１月２７日，达赖喇嘛致信中央，报告他亲政情况，并表达谋求和平的愿望。中央复电祝贺他亲政，欢迎他速派代表来京和谈。４月２２日，达赖喇嘛派出的以阿沛·阿旺晋美为首席全权代表的和谈代表到达北京。４月２７日，班禅大师率领的致敬团到达北京。班禅大师真诚拥护中央和平解放西藏的方针，并表示要团结藏族各方力量，推动这一方针的实现。经过中央人民政府全权代表李维汉等同西藏地方政府代表的多次谈判，在达赖喇嘛、班禅大师的响应和努力下，具有重大历史意义的《关于和平解放西藏办法的协议》于１９５１年５月２３日在北京签字。协议签字的第二天下午，班禅大师率领班禅堪厅主要负责官员，向毛主席和中央人民政府致敬，献给毛主席一面用藏汉两种文字写的“中国各民族人民的大救星”的锦旗。当晚，毛主席为庆祝协议签订设宴，并讲了话。５月２８日，班禅大师及堪厅人员以“难以言喻的兴奋”心情发表声明，说协议的签订“宣告了帝国主义对于西藏侵略的失败，西藏民族与中国各民族团结起来，西藏民族内部团结起来，从此西藏民族开始了自己历史的新纪元。”声明对达赖喇嘛响应中央号召，派代表来京和谈并签订协议的举动表示“深为敬重”。在此期间，班禅大师还致电达赖喇嘛，“愿竭绵薄”和达赖喇嘛“精诚团结”，协助他和西藏地方政府彻底实行和平解放西藏的协议。与此同时，班禅大师致电西藏扎什伦布寺政教官员和僧俗民众，希望他们在中央人民政府和毛主席的领导下团结一致，“彻底实现这个协议，积极地援助人民解放军入藏部队，驱逐帝国主义在西藏的侵略势力。”
    １９５１年１２月１５日，班禅大师自青海西宁返藏前夕，我受中央委托，代表毛主席、中央人民政府和西北军政委员会，专程赴西宁为他送行。班禅大师及其堪厅派了喇嘛仪仗队欢迎我。在各族各界１０００多人的欢迎大会上，班禅大师发表了热情洋溢的讲话。他激动地说：“如果没有中国共产党和毛主席的正确领导，与中国各兄弟民族的热诚帮助，西藏和平解放是根本不可能的，我们返回西藏亦是不可能的。因此，我们说中国共产党和毛主席是西藏人民的大救星，是我们的大恩人。我们只有跟着共产党和毛主席走，只有同祖国各兄弟民族紧密地团结起来，我们西藏民族才能得到彻底的解放，别的道路是没有的。”班禅大师这段话情真意切。他的前世即第九世班禅曲吉尼玛，由于同十三世达赖喇嘛失和，被迫离开西藏，长期流落内地达２６年，直到圆寂时也没能回到西藏。如今，返藏回寺的愿望终于由十世班禅额尔德尼·确吉坚赞实现了。他高兴、激动是很自然的。
    这次见面，我们进行了亲切的交谈。我说：你回西藏后不要急，要照顾全局，首先要做好藏族内部的团结，这样西藏各方面的工作才有希望。我还根据中央的精神，向我们派去陪同班禅大师进藏的负责同志交代了两条：一是西藏一切工作都要贯彻慎重稳进的方针，条件不成熟的事不要办，上层爱国人士和领袖人物不同意的事不要办。二是西藏工作要以反帝爱国统一战线为主。回想起来，中央的这些精神直到现在仍然是有意义的。
    １９５２年４月间，当班禅大师返藏到达藏北重镇那曲时，由西藏地方政府两个代理司伦鲁康娃和洛桑扎西等人在拉萨策动了反对和平解放西藏协议的伪人民会议事件。班禅大师甚为愤慨，致电达赖喇嘛，要求达赖喇嘛“以大智大勇之精神，大慈大悲之佛光”严肃处理这一破坏祖国统一，破坏藏族内部团结，尤其是破坏达赖喇嘛政教威信的严重事件。终于，达赖喇嘛出布告解散了伪人民会议，并撤销了鲁康娃和洛桑扎西的代理司伦职务。４月２８日，班禅抵达拉萨。到拉萨后，他同达赖喇嘛达成谅解，互换了哈达。
    １９５４年９月，班禅大师与达赖喇嘛联袂赴京参加第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议。那时，我已在中央工作。自那以后到１９６２年，我受中央委托，一直负责同班禅大师联系，我们之间的关系越来越密切，友情越来越深厚。
    班禅大师作为我们党的忠诚朋友，突出地表现在能主动地向党提出中肯的意见、建议乃至尖锐的批评。他刚直、豪爽，知无不言，言无不尽。这一点我颇为了解，而且认为甚为难得。我总感到，能交上这样的诤友可谓幸事。由于有这样的了解，所以我对他也是以心换心，坦诚相见的。我常对他说：为了党和人民的事业，为了国家的统一和团结，我们两个人什么话都可以说，我有错误你批评，你有错误我批评，实事求是。我知道他遇事爱性急，甚至动气，但并不是一个固执己见的人。他一生追求真理，弃恶扬善，对正确的意见总是听的，听得真切，做得也认真。我常对他说：直言不讳是对的，但不能急，好事一下做不完，更不要动气。他说：你是我的老朋友、好朋友，你了解我，你是为我好才这样说、这样做，我很高兴。
    班禅大师一生关心西藏社会的发展和进步，积极拥护西藏的民主改革。１９５６年西藏自治区筹委会成立时，即提出在班禅堪布会议厅管辖的地区率先进行民主改革试点，以取得经验，然后推广到全区。中央根据西藏的实际情况，认为民主改革的条件不成熟，宣布“六年不改”的方针，班禅大师听从了中央的意见，没有进行试点。１９５９年３月１０日，西藏上层反动集团为了维护封建农奴制度，反对改革，公然撕毁１７条协议，发动了全面的武装叛乱。鉴于这种情况，国务院下令解散了原西藏地方政府，由西藏自治区筹委会行使地方政府职权，任命班禅大师为筹委会代理主任委员，并确定边平叛边改革的方针。班禅大师致电毛主席、周总理，表示拥护国务院的命令和决定，同时复电西藏工委和军区，说“我已指示堪厅，现在更应继续和分工委、解放军加强团结，密切合作，做好准备，确保日喀则市的安全，共同粉碎和镇压叛乱。”４月８日，班禅大师主持筹委会，号召平息叛乱。１９６０年４月２２日，筹委会召开第四次会议，班禅大师在总结报告中高度评价平叛、改革的重大意义，指出：１９５９年是“西藏人民取得决定性胜利的一年”。
    西藏的平叛、改革是西藏社会进步和人民翻身的伟大革命。但是在后期出现了“左”的偏差。班禅大师对此是很不满意的，他到北京向中央反映情况。毛主席、周总理和李维汉等同志都分别听取了大师的意见。毛主席称赞大师敢于讲真话的好作风，并对他提出的一些好意见给予了肯定和鼓励。这期间，中央派杨静仁同志去西藏调查。１９６１年１月５日，小平同志在听取了杨静仁同志的汇报后，指示西藏民主改革后要防“左”、防急，并且确定西藏稳定发展、５年不办合作社的方针。１月２４日，周总理在同班禅大师和张经武同志谈话时指出：“西藏的方针政策概括起来就是，土地所有制是农民个体所有制，这个制度要继续好多年，中心是增加生产，这条要坚定不移地执行下去”。此后，班禅大师回西藏主持工作，并到其他藏区视察，１９６２年５月向国务院呈送了一份《七万言书》，系统地提出了他对西藏和其他藏区工作的批评和建议。中央、国务院对此十分重视，认为大师的大部分意见和建议是好的，但也有一些是过头的。我受周总理的委托多次去看望大师并同他交谈。他火气很大，说了些激烈的话。我充分肯定了他敢于向党直言不讳地提意见的可贵精神，同时劝他不要动气，不要说气话。过了一会儿，他消了气说：你讲的我接受，你从小看着我长大，从一开始就帮助我，你是代表党的，作为个人又是朋友。你是为我好，我感激，但有些不该说的气话已经说出去了，我今后注意就是了，但我说明，我是真心为党好的。班禅就是这样一位心底透亮的大师。后来我和李维汉、阿沛副委员长等同大师又坦诚地交换意见，经过共同研究产生了旨在西藏工作中纠“左”防急的４个好文件，并报经国务院批准。遗憾的是，１９６２年八届十中全会后，由于“左”的指导思想的影响，这４个文件没能贯彻执行下去。班禅大师和李维汉等，也包括我在内，都因此被批判。从此我和班禅大师的交往中断了十几年。“文革”中班禅大师与许多党和国家领导人一样受到严重迫害，虽然如此，班禅大师仍没有动摇过对党和祖国的坚定的信念。
    党的十一届三中全会后，我和班禅大师又得以重逢。老友相见，感慨万端。大师见到我时很不安地说：因为我的《七万言书》，把你给连累了，真对不起。我说：这不是谁连累谁的问题，我们都受到了锻炼和考验，增长了见识，党对你是了解的。
    党的十一届三中全会后，班禅大师坚决拥护党中央拨乱反正，不遗余力地协助党中央落实各项政策。党中央对班禅大师也给予充分的信任。１９８０年班禅大师去藏区视察前，小平同志约他到家里，亲切地对他说：“你是我们国家最好的爱国者”，“你自己的活动，可以放手，不要顾虑”，“你在这次下去的时候可以说：‘文化革命’中那些事情都错了。你不要怕，就说这是中央领导同志讲的。”班禅大师听后受到很大鼓舞，对党更加信赖。为了把失去的时间抢回来，他常常是夜以继日地工作和学习。
    １９８０年底，我从广东回到中央后又分管民族、宗教、统战工作，我们接触的机会更多，友谊更加牢固。班禅大师作为国家领导人和宗教领袖，他在这个时期的任务更繁重，工作更繁忙。尽管如此，我们见面交往的时间并没有减少，我们坦诚相见的习惯一如既往。每当他视察、出国和进行其他重大活动时，我总是劝告他：一要注意身体、安全；二遇事要冷静、不要动气。他每次回来总是来找我谈谈心，什么话都谈。对他的每一次成功我都由衷地感动高兴，毫不含糊地给予支持。当然对我觉得他还不足的地方，我也是毫不客气地指出来，他认为我说的不对时也同我争辩，或表示保留自己的意见。１９８５年，班禅大师对河南省把少林寺交给嵩山管理局一事提出了强烈批评，并要“就这件事闹到底，不搞个水落石出决不撒手”。我见了这份材料，立即指出：“抓政策落实，精神可嘉，但不要火气太大”，“少林寺由僧尼管理为宜”，“如拖着不办，再派大员去查明原因何在？或请大师亲临督促。”最后这件事得到妥善解决，班禅大师很高兴。
    班禅大师作为藏传佛教的杰出领袖，他热爱自己信仰的宗教；作为藏民族的优秀代表，他热爱自己的民族；作为伟大的爱国主义者，他热爱祖国；作为党的忠诚朋友，他热爱中国共产党。把爱教、爱民族和爱国、爱党完美地统一起来，这正是班禅大师一生的写照。
    班禅大师热爱中国共产党，成为党的忠诚朋友，出自对自己民族命运和前途的深入思考，出自对党的方针、政策的深切理解，出自对历史和现实的深刻研究。１９８２年他在西藏拉萨干部大会上作了一次长篇报告，系统地叙述了西藏和祖国关系的历史，雄辩地得出结论说：“西藏成为伟大祖国不可分割的一部分，是长期历史发展的必然结果，是无法否认的历史事实。现实来说，西藏和平解放后的三十年的发展和进步，超过了历史上的几百年或上千年，这又是一个不可否认的事实。历史和现实告诉我们，西藏只有在中国共产党领导下的社会主义祖国大家庭中，才有光辉灿烂的前途，才有民族的兴旺发达；西藏人民只有维护祖国的统一，加强汉藏民族之间以及祖国各民族之间的大团结，在中国共产党的领导下，坚定地走社会主义道路，才有真正幸福美满的未来。”“历史的教训使我们懂得，爱祖国同爱民族是统一的，二者不可分割，更不应对立起来。现在有人企图利用历史上遗留下来的民族隔阂的残余，用爱民族来否定爱祖国，打着民族的旗号来反对祖国。对此应保持高度警惕，并及时揭穿他们所谓爱民族的虚伪性。”他还说：“坚持民族利益同国家利益的一致性，坚持爱祖国爱民族的立场，才是唯一正确的立场，才能成为光明正大的、无私无畏的有益于人民的人”。对于宗教，班禅大师继承黄教始祖宗喀巴大师的传统，坚持改革，兴利除弊，从有益于人民利益出发，研究探索宗教与社会主义相适应的经验，把佛教“庄严国土，利乐有情”的教义同爱国主义结合起来，把“普渡众生”同为人民服务的宗旨协调起来，鼓励信教徒团结在党的周围，为建设四化，振兴中华而共同奋斗。
    从这几年的接触中，我深深感到我这位亲密的朋友班禅越发成熟了。去年我们曾为大师的“知天命”之年祝贺，祈愿大师为祖国为民族作出更辉煌的业绩。正如小平同志对他说的：“你还是有思考的，有分析、有能力，希望你对祖国多作一些贡献”。然而我们的大师去矣！这个损失确是难以弥补的。
    悲大师之示寂，冀乘愿之再来。我们要完成班禅大师未竟的事业，为维护祖国统一和民族团结，为建设团结、富裕、文明的社会主义新西藏，为促进各民族的共同繁荣，作出新的贡献。
    我们党的忠诚朋友班禅大师永垂不朽！
