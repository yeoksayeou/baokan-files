Now, a bottle of Maotai or Wuliangye costs a hundred or two hundred yuan; a bottle of Fenjiu or Xifeng costs dozens of yuan. Despite the high prices, people still buy them. Among the buyers are high-income individuals and millionaires, but there are also ordinary people whose income is just enough for basic living expenses. Those who can buy them at a low price are indeed a minority.

Buying such expensive liquor, some people do so because they are addicted, while others do it to show off. However, a significant number of people, who bite the bullet to withdraw savings or borrow money to buy a few bottles of Maotai or Luzhou Laojiao, have special purposes. It serves as a "knocking stone" to open some people's "back doors"; it is a "hand grenade" that can make some people "ecstatic," and thus their requests can be granted. Some people say that to ask certain special individuals for help, even to handle matters according to regulations, one must "shed some blood." This phrase is very vivid. Blood is extremely precious, but to get things done, some people have no choice but to endure the pain of "shedding blood."

Hopefully, one day, things can be handled according to regulations without having to "shed blood." This should not be a mere wish.

### “出点血”

　　“出点血”
    现在，茅台、五粮液每瓶都已一两百元；汾酒、西凤等也得几十元一瓶。这么贵，还是有人去买。其中有“高薪人士”，有“万元户”，却也有收入仅够温饱的一般人员。能用低价买到手的，自然是有的，那毕竟是少数。
    用如此高价买名酒，有些确实是因为有瘾，有些则是摆派头，但相当一部分人，咬牙取存款或借钱买几瓶茅台或泸州特曲之类，是有特殊用途的。它是“敲门砖”，能敲开有些人的“后门”；它是“手榴弹”，能炸得有些人“心花怒放”，所求也就可获应允了。有人说要请有些特殊人士帮帮忙甚至照章办事，必须“出点血”。这个提法很富形象性。血极贵重，但为了把事办成，有些人不得不忍痛出“血”。
    但愿有一天无需出“血”，就照章能办事。这不会是奢望。
