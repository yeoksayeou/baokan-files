Vice Premier Tian Jiyun said today that the economies of China and the United States each have their own strengths and are highly complementary. There are many products that can be exchanged and areas where cooperation can take place, with great potential for further development and a very broad prospect.

At the invitation of Minnesota Governor Arne Carlson, Tian Jiyun delivered a speech at the opening ceremony of the Minnesota World Trade Center during a Beijing-Sao Paulo satellite television discussion on "The Prospects of Minnesota in Asia."

Tian Jiyun said that in the 10 years since the establishment of diplomatic relations, the economic and trade development between the two countries has achieved remarkable results. By the end of 1988, the bilateral trade volume had increased from less than $1 billion in 1979 to over $10 billion. American enterprises have invested in 630 projects in China, with a contract value of $3.4 billion.

However, Tian Jiyun said, these achievements are still far from the level that should be achieved compared to the potential of both sides.

He said that China will make new efforts in adjusting the export product structure, improving the quality of export products, and adapting to the market demand in the United States. At the same time, China also hopes that the United States will take a more active attitude and effective policy measures in areas such as export quotas and technology transfer, to further increase the import of Chinese goods and transfer more advanced technologies to China.

Tian Jiyun said that in the 10 years since China implemented the reform and opening-up policy, all aspects have developed significantly, and trade and economic and technological cooperation relations with countries around the world have become increasingly close and strengthened. In 1988, China's import and export volume exceeded $100 billion, nearly four times the amount in 1978.

He said that China welcomes foreign investors to come to China to develop energy, transportation, and infrastructure projects, to establish more sole proprietorships, and especially encourages the use of existing Chinese enterprises to introduce advanced foreign technologies to establish "three-in-one" enterprises.

He said, "We welcome American businessmen to actively invest in China, to play a significant role in developing Sino-American economic and trade relations and technological cooperation, and to push the economic, trade, and technological cooperation and exchanges between the two countries to a new level."

Tian Jiyun hopes that the Minnesota World Trade Center will achieve new successes in increasing American understanding of China, promoting Sino-American friendship, and developing long-term stable economic and trade cooperation relations.

　　应柏毕奇州长的邀请
  　田纪云向美国明州发表电视讲话
    指出中美经济各有优势互补性强合作前景广阔
    新华社北京２月９日电  田纪云副总理今天在这里说，中美两国经济各有优势，而且互补性强，彼此可以交换的产品和合作的领域很多，进一步发展的潜力很大，前景十分广阔。
    田纪云应明州州长柏毕奇的邀请，在明州世界贸易中心开幕时举行的“明尼苏达州在亚洲的前景”的北京—圣保罗间卫星电视讨论会上发表讲话。
    田纪云说，建交１０年来，两国经济贸易发展取得了喜人的成果。到１９８８年底，双边贸易额已由１９７９年的不足１０亿美元迅速增加到１００多亿美元，美国企业来华投资项目达到６３０个，投资合同金额达３４亿美元。
    但是，田纪云说，这些成果同双方的潜力相比，还远未达到应有的水平。
    他说，中国方面将在调整出口产品结构、提高出口产品质量、适应美国市场需求等方面做出新的努力；同时，中国也希望美国在出口配额、技术转让等方面采取更加积极的态度和有效的政策措施，进一步增加中国商品的进口，向中国转让更多的先进技术。
    田纪云说，中国实行改革开放政策１０年来，各方面都有长足的发展，同世界各国的贸易往来和经济技术合作关系日益密切和加强。１９８８年中国的进出口额超过１０００亿美元，比１９７８年增长近４倍。
    他说中国欢迎外国投资者来中国兴办能源、交通、基础设施项目，多办一些独资企业，特别鼓励利用中国现有企业嫁接国外先进技术，兴办“三资”企业。
    他说，“我们欢迎美国企业家，踊跃来华投资，在发展中美经贸关系与技术合作方面大显身手，把两国经济、贸易和技术合作与交流推向一个新的水平。”
    田纪云希望明州世界贸易中心在增进美国各界对中国的了解，促进中美友好和经济贸易合作关系长期稳定发展等方面取得新的成就。
