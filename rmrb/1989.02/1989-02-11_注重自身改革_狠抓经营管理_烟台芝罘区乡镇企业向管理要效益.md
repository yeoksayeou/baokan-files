In the face of reduced fixed asset investment and severe shortages of credit funds, how should township enterprises respond? The approach taken by the township enterprises in Zifu District, Yantai City, Shandong Province, is to prioritize economic efficiency, focusing on strengthening enterprise management, thereby enabling enterprises to withstand severe challenges.

Over the past year, the Zifu District Committee and District Government have conducted a sober analysis of the crises facing township enterprises. They observed that while township enterprises have developed rapidly in recent years and many have reached a considerable scale, some suffer from poor management, a lack of talent, and low employee quality. Strengthening enterprise management is essential for these enterprises to stand firm in the new situation. Therefore, the District Committee and District Government have made guiding township enterprises to enhance internal management a strategic measure.

While gradually implementing the factory director appointment system, factory director responsibility system, and factory director audit system in township enterprises, the district has also formulated an enterprise classification upgrade plan based on new circumstances. This plan links the economic interests of cadres and workers directly to the level of enterprise management. For every level an enterprise is upgraded, the salaries and bonuses of cadres and workers will increase accordingly. Simultaneously, the district has summarized and promoted the advanced management experiences of enterprises such as Yantai Petroleum Machinery Factory and Yantai Radio Factory No. 7, guiding enterprises to focus on management, achieve higher classifications, and significantly improve economic efficiency.

To enhance the quality of cadres and workers, the district has established a three-tier technical training network. The district has set up a vocational college for township enterprise workers to cultivate local talents; towns regularly hold business training classes for enterprise management personnel; village-run enterprises organize technical night schools to systematically teach cadres and workers technical and management knowledge. Additionally, the district has selected over 200 township enterprise workers to study at universities nationwide. Currently, nearly 30,000 township enterprise workers in the district have received various forms of technical training, accounting for half of the total workforce; the average technical level of workers has reached 3.5. Among them, over 1,300 people have obtained technical titles of technician or above, playing a significant role in improving enterprise management and product quality. The Tashan Industrial Company under Qishan Subdistrict Office recruited an engineer from Northeast China. He brought scientific management experiences from state-owned factories into Yantai Petroleum Machinery Factory, actively assisting the factory's leadership in strengthening comprehensive quality management. Last year, the factory became the only township enterprise in Shandong Province to receive a ministerial-level "Enterprise Quality Management Award."

### 注重自身改革　狠抓经营管理  烟台芝罘区乡镇企业向管理要效益

　　注重自身改革　狠抓经营管理    
    烟台芝罘区乡镇企业向管理要效益
    新华社济南２月１０日电  （通讯员王学宗）在压缩固定资产投资规模、信贷资金严重不足的情况下，乡镇企业如何动作？山东省烟台芝罘区乡镇企业的做法是：以经济效益为中心，把注意力和工作重点放在加强企业的经营管理上，使企业经受住严峻考验。
    去年以来，芝罘区委、区政府对乡镇企业面临的危机作了冷静分析。他们看到，乡镇企业这几年发展很快，大部分已具相当规模，但是，一些企业管理不善，人才缺乏，职工素质较差。只有强化企业管理，才能使它们在新形势下站稳脚根。为此，区委、区政府把引导乡镇企业加强内部管理做为一项战略措施来抓。
    这个区在乡镇企业内逐步实行厂长聘任制、厂长负责制和厂长调离审计制的同时，根据新情况，制订了与干部、职工经济利益直接挂钩的以经营管理为衡量尺度的企业类别升级方案。凡企业升上一级，干部职工的工资、奖金都有相应增加。同时还总结推广了烟台石油机械厂、烟台无线电七厂等单位改革分配制度，优化劳动组合等先进管理经验，引导企业抓管理，上等级，大力提高企业经济效益。
    为提高干部、职工素质，这个区建立了三级技术培训网络。区里成立了乡镇企业职工中专，专门培养自己的乡土人才；各镇定期举办企业管理人员业务培训班；村办企业举办技术夜校，组织干部、职工系统学习技术基础知识和企业管理知识。同时，全区还选派２００多名乡镇企业职工到全国一些大专院校深造。目前，全区有近３万名乡镇企业职工接受了不同形式的技术训练，占职工总数的一半；职工平均技术等级达到了３．５级。其中，１３００多人获得技术员以上技术职称，对改善企业管理，提高产品质量起到了促进作用。奇山街道办事处下属的塔山工商公司从东北招聘一位工程师，他把国营厂的一些科学管理经验带进烟台石油机械厂，积极协助这个厂的领导加强全面质量管理，去年，这个厂一举成为山东省唯一获部级“企业质量管理奖”的乡镇企业。
