Reform and opening up have brought the ancient port city of Ningbo from decline to prosperity. In 1988, the city's total industrial output value reached 20.57 billion yuan, national income reached 10.5 billion yuan, and foreign trade exports exceeded 1 billion yuan for the first time, making it one of the top ten industrial star cities in China with an industrial output value exceeding 20 billion yuan.

In the process of opening up to the outside world, the overseas "Ningbo Gang" has played a significant role. By the end of 1988, the "Ningbo Gang" had donated over 100 million yuan to their hometown. More than half of the city's three-in-one enterprises and three-in-one compensation enterprises were set up with the help of the overseas "Ningbo Gang."

　　宁波工业产值超二百亿    
    跻身十大明星城市行列
    据新华社杭州２月１９日电  （记者虞云达、朱幼棣）改革开放使我国古老的港口城市宁波从衰落走向繁荣。１９８８年，全市工业总产值达到２０５．７亿元，国民收入达１０５亿元，外贸出口首次突破１０亿元，成为全国十大工业总产值超２００亿元的工业明星城市之一。
    在对外开放中，爱国爱乡的海外“宁波帮”发挥了重要作用。到１９８８年止，“宁波帮”捐赠家乡资金已超过１亿元。全市的三资企业和三来一补企业，有一半以上是由海外“宁波帮”穿针引线办成的。
