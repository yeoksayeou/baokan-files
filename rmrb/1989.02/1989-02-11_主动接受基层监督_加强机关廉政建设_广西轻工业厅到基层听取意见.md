The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Light Industry Bureau has adopted the method of going to the grassroots to solicit opinions from cadres and the masses on whether the bureau leadership is clean and honest. This approach proactively accepts grassroots supervision, ensuring that bureau staff correctly use their authority. This has been praised by grassroots cadres and the masses.

The Light Industry Bureau is the administrative unit overseeing the light industry across the region, holding administrative management power over grassroots units and enterprises. To check and understand whether the leadership and staff are honest and faithfully serve the grassroots, in the latter half of last year, the bureau's Party Committee and Discipline Inspection Commission sent officials to eight prefectures, cities, and counties' light industry management departments and 25 grassroots enterprises. They solicited opinions and evaluations from cadres and the masses on the bureau's leadership and staff regarding honesty.

The grassroots masses reflected that, in general, the bureau is honest. However, there are some issues. For example, some individuals in the bureau help relatives with business by securing supplies, asking enterprises to provide products at preferential prices, which makes the enterprises feel troubled. Some companies affiliated with the bureau demand preferential supply terms from grassroots enterprises, and if the enterprises do not agree, they encounter cold treatment. Some direct subordinates and companies of the bureau show favoritism in allocating resources or evaluating enterprises, and their handling of matters is not fair.

The officials who participated in soliciting opinions from grassroots enterprises promptly fed back the evaluations to the bureau leaders and relevant Party members and cadres in the direct subordinates. The bureau's Party Committee then supervised and studied the rectification and implementation of these issues. After listening to the feedback, the bureau leaders promptly conducted evaluations. Based on the opinions gathered from grassroots units and enterprises, they commended units and individuals who were honest and served the grassroots well. Regarding the issue of some individuals asking enterprises for products, the Light Industry Bureau also issued a "Notice on Prohibiting Individuals from Asking Enterprises for Products" to various municipal light industry departments and grassroots enterprises, requesting them to supervise the implementation. Through this activity, units that previously did not consider the grassroots' interests and did not provide enough benefits have actively corrected their mistakes. Individuals who previously privately asked enterprises for products have also actively admitted their mistakes to the organization and wrote letters to the enterprise units to self-criticize, promising not to repeat the mistake.

　　主动接受基层监督　加强机关廉政建设    
    广西轻工业厅到基层听取意见
    新华社南宁２月１０日电  （记者刘星泽）广西壮族自治区轻工业厅采取到基层听取干部和群众对厅领导机关是否清政廉洁的意见的方法，主动接受基层监督，使机关工作人员正确运用手中掌握的权力，受到基层干部和群众的赞扬。
    轻工业厅是全区轻工业的主管单位，对基层单位和企业在业务上拥有行政管理权。为了检查和了解领导和工作人员在与基层单位和企业交往中是否廉洁、忠实地为基层服务，去年下半年，机关党委和纪检组的同志先后到全区８个地、市、县的轻工主管部门和２５个基层企业单位，向干部和群众征询他们对厅机关领导和工作人员在廉洁问题上的意见和评价。基层群众反映，总的说厅机关是廉洁的，但也存在一些问题。如厅机关个别同志为亲戚做生意拉货源，想要企业以优惠价供应产品，使企业感到为难；还有的厅属公司要基层企业满足他们提出的优惠供货要求，企业没有答应，办事就遭到冷遇；厅里有的直属机构和公司在分配物资或搞企业评比问题上厚此薄彼，办事不够公平等。
    参加向基层企业征询意见的同志，把基层的评议及时反馈给厅里和厅直机构的领导和有关党员、干部，并由厅机关党委督促研究整改和落实处理。厅领导听取反馈意见后，及时进行讲评，根据从基层单位和企业中征询得来的意见，对那些廉洁奉公、为基层服务搞得好的单位和个人进行表扬。针对个别人向企业要产品的情况，轻工业厅还专门给各地市轻工部门和基层企业发了《不准个人向企业要产品的通知》，请各企业监督执行。通过这一活动，原来个别在与基层企业单位交往中，不为基层着想、让利不够的单位，都主动纠正了错误，原来曾向企业私自要过产品的同志，也主动向组织承认了错误，并写信向企业单位作了自我批评，保证不再重犯。
