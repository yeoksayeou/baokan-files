In Fujian's rural areas, one can hear the phrase "The plan for next year starts this winter" everywhere. The entire society's focus on agriculture has begun to take shape in Fujian before the arrival of spring.

At the provincial rural work conference, Provincial Party Secretary Chen Guangyi proposed: The issue of agriculture is a matter of the overall economy, and comprehensive measures must be taken to mobilize the enthusiasm of various industries to create a strong atmosphere for agricultural development throughout society. Comprehensive measures must be taken to accelerate agricultural development.

Fujian Province requires: For agricultural development, top leaders must take the lead, county leaders must devote their main efforts, and everyone must give their all. Relevant departments must fulfill their duties, and various industries must provide strong support.

Planning, financial, and banking departments are doing everything possible to increase agricultural investment. Fujian's fiscal budget for agricultural business expenses and agricultural support funds has increased by 28 million yuan this year, and the provincial budget for agricultural infrastructure investment is 420 million yuan, increasing by 10% and 13.5% respectively compared to last year. The fiscal plans of all levels in the province have increased agricultural support funds by 113 million yuan, an increase of 27.6% compared to last year, accounting for 20.4% of the province's new fiscal revenue.

This year, Fujian will also organize 30,000 scientific and technological personnel to conduct research and provide technical services for agricultural development, implement the "Harvest Plan" and "Spark Plan," establish 100 scientific and technological demonstration townships across the province, set up demonstration fields and high-yield areas, and carry out applied research. This year, 100 million yuan will be allocated for agricultural research funds, an increase of 80% compared to last year, and 200 million US dollars in foreign exchange will be allocated for agricultural introductions.

Fujian also requires that law enforcement and supervision departments ensure the implementation of various policies and regulations in rural areas, strengthen land management, and price departments strengthen the price management of specialized agricultural materials. In rural areas, gradually implement the public allocation of planned commodities and the use of various agricultural support funds, accept the supervision of farmers, and resolutely stop practices such as pressuring and underpricing the purchase of agricultural and sideline products that harm farmers.

　　主要领导动手　各行各业支援
　  福建形成抓农业大气候
    本报福州电  记者张铭清报道：在福建乡村，到处可以听到“明年之计在今冬”的话题，全社会抓农业的大气候已赶在春天之前开始在福建形成。
    在省农村工作会议上，省委书记陈光毅提出：农业问题是国民经济的全局问题，要采取全局的措施，调动各行各业的积极性，在全社会形成抓农业的大气候。要采取配套措施，加速农业的发展。
    福建省要求：抓农业，主要领导要亲自动手，县领导要用主要精力来抓，全力以赴。有关部门要尽职尽责，各行各业要大力支援。
    计划、财政、金融部门千方百计挤资金增加农业投入，福建今年财政预算内农业事业费和支农资金已增加安排２８００万元，省预算内农业基建投资安排４２００万元，分别比去年增长１０％和１３．５％，全省各级财政计划增加支农资金１．１３亿元，比去年增长２７．６％，占全省新增财力的２０．４％。
    今年福建还要组织３万名科技人员为发展农业搞好科研攻关和技术服务，落实“丰收计划”和“星火计划”，在全省办１００个科技示范乡镇，建立示范田、丰产片，开展应用研究，今年安排农业科研经费１０００万元，比上年增加８０％，安排２００万美元外汇额度用于农业引进。
    福建还要求执法监督部门保证农村各项政策、法规的贯彻落实，加强土地管理，物价部门加强专营农用物资的价格管理。在农村逐步推行公开专营商品的计划分配和各项支农资金安排使用，接受农民的监督，坚决制止压等压价收购农副产品等“坑农”行为。
