Greece's investment total increased by 14.6% last year. The funds were mainly used for tourism, industry, technology, and agriculture.

Xinhua News Agency, Athens, February 1 (Reporter Zhou Xisheng) According to the Greek National Economy Department, Greece's domestic and foreign investment total in 1988 reached 165.7 billion drachmas (approximately $1.1 billion), an increase of 14.6% from the 144.6 billion drachmas (approximately $9.7 billion) in 1987.

It was announced that in 1988, the Greek National Economy Department approved a total of 2,356 domestic and foreign investment projects, nearly 500 more than the previous year. Among these, approximately 40% of the investments were used for the development of the tourism industry, including the construction and renovation of various tourist facilities, the updating of hotel equipment, and the establishment of new tourism services.

Tourism is one of the three major sources of foreign exchange earnings for Greece over the years. According to the latest statistics from the Greek National Tourism Organization, Greece received approximately 8 million foreign tourists last year, with tourism foreign exchange earnings reaching nearly $1.5 billion. It is estimated that through the new investments in 1988, the tourism sector in Greece can add tens of thousands of jobs, and the hotel accommodation capacity can be increased by nearly 10%.

According to the announcement, the remaining investments in 1988 will mainly be used for the development of Greece's industry, technology, and agriculture, in order to keep up with the construction of the European Community's internal unified market.

In the mid-1980s, Greece experienced stagnation and even a decline in both domestic and foreign investments for several years. Since October 1985, the government has been implementing a series of new measures aimed at stabilizing, improving the economy, and encouraging private initiative, which has significantly improved the economic situation. Last year, the GDP growth rate exceeded 2%, thereby greatly improving the investment environment. Statistics show that in the two years of 1987-1988, Greece's total investment doubled compared to the two years of 1985-1986.

　　希腊去年投资总额增加１４．６％
　　主要用于旅游业、工业、科技和农业
    新华社雅典２月１日电  （记者周锡生）据希腊国民经济部今天公布，希腊１９８８年的本国和外国投资总额达到１６５７亿德拉克马（约合１１亿美元），比１９８７年的１４４６亿德拉克马（约合９．７亿美元）的投资总额增加１４．６％。
    据宣布，１９８８年希腊国民经济部共批准本国和外国的投资项目２３５６项，比上一年度增加近５００项。其中用于发展旅游业的投资约占４０％，包括新建或修建各种旅游设施，旅馆设备更新，开办新的旅游服务项目。
    旅游业是希腊多年来外汇收入的三大来源之一。据希腊国家旅游组织公布的最新统计数字，去年希腊共接待外国游客约８００万，旅游外汇收入近１５亿美元。据估计，通过１９８８年的新投资，希腊旅游部门可增加上万个职位，旅馆的接待能力可提高近１０％。
    据公布，１９８８年的其余投资将主要用于发展希腊的工业、科技和农业，以便希腊跟上欧共体建设内部统一大市场的步伐。
    希腊在８０年代中期的几年里无论是本国还是外国投资都停滞不前，甚至出现减少的现象。由于政府在１９８５年１０月以来坚持采取一系列旨在稳定、改善经济和鼓励私人积极性的新措施，希腊经济形势有了较大好转，去年国民生产总值增长率超过了２％，从而使投资环境也大有改善。据统计，在１９８７—１９８８这两年里，希腊的投资总额比１９８５—１９８６两年间翻了一番。
