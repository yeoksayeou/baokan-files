	Banks Continuously Raise Interest Rates, Residents of the Capital Eagerly Save
		Beijing Industrial and Commercial Bank Sees Significant Increase in Savings Deposits

		According to a report, on February 1 this year, banks raised interest rates again, which was welcomed by Beijing residents. According to statistics from the Beijing branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank, which has the most savings outlets, the savings deposit balance in the first ten days of February increased by 131.59 million yuan, which is 59.33 million yuan more than the same period last year, an increase of 82%; and 62.71 million yuan more than the same period in January this year, an increase of 91%.

		Due to the significant increase in the interest rates for fixed-term savings this time, the interest rates for different term deposits from six months to eight years have all increased by 31% to 42%. Therefore, many residents see that long-term savings are profitable and have been transferring their demand deposits to fixed-term deposits, with more and more people saving. The Wangfujing Savings Office had an average of 300 households depositing fixed-term savings daily in the first ten days of January, but in the first ten days of February, the average number of households depositing fixed-term savings reached more than 500. This single item of business volume has increased by more than 60%. In response, the Beijing branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank promptly organized staff to study new calculation procedures, replace interest rate tables, and provide propaganda, explanations, and consultation services to the broad masses of depositors, attracting many residents to deposit idle cash in the bank. According to statistics, in the two days following the interest rate adjustment on February 1, the new deposits in various items at the Wangfujing and other nine savings offices alone, those deposited in cash accounted for 43%. According to a survey of 93 depositors, 71 were willing to participate in savings after the interest rate adjustment, accounting for 76.3%. Of these, 48 thought the interest rate increase was appropriate, accounting for 51.6%, and 17 thought it was too low, accounting for 18.3%. One depositor happily said, "The bank's second interest rate increase is beneficial to protecting the interests of depositors. This way, people are willing to save the money they don't need for the time being."

　　银行连续调高利率　首都居民踊跃储蓄    
    北京工商银行储蓄存款大幅度上升
    本报讯  今年２月１日银行再度调高利率，受到北京市民欢迎。据北京储蓄网点最多的市工商银行统计，２月上旬该行储蓄存款余额增加１３１５９万元，比去年同期多增５９３３万元，增长幅度８２％；比今年１月同期多增６２７１万元，增长幅度９１％。
    由于此次定期储蓄利率调高幅度较大，整存整取半年期至８年期的不同期限存款中，利率上调幅度均在３１％至４２％之间，因此不少居民看到长期储蓄有利可图，纷纷将活期存款转存定期，存款的人愈来愈多。王府井储蓄所１月上旬日均存入整存整取定期的为３００户，２月上旬日均存入整存整取的竟达５００多户，该所仅此一项业务量就增长６０％以上。对此，北京市工商银行及时组织干部职工学习新的核算手续，更换利率表，对广大储户进行宣传、解释和提供咨询服务，吸引很多居民将手持的闲散现金存入银行。据统计，２月１日调整利率后的两天，仅王府井等９个储蓄所的各项新增存款中，以现金存入的就占４３％。据对９３位储户调查，自利率调整后愿意参加储蓄的有７１位，占７６．３％。认为利率上调幅度适中的有４８位，占５１．６％，认为偏低的有１７位，占１８．３％。一储户高兴地说：“银行再次调高存款利率有利于保护储户利益，这样人们就愿意把暂时不用的钱存起来了。”
