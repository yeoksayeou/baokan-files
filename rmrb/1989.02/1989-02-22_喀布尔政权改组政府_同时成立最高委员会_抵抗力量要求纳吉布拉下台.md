The Kabul regime has reorganized its government and established a Supreme Council. Resistance forces demand Najibullah's resignation.

According to a report by foreign news agencies, an official from Afghanistan revealed on the 20th that President Najibullah of the Kabul regime has dismissed Prime Minister Muhammad Hassan Sharq. Najibullah will now concurrently serve as the Prime Minister.

Sharq has held the position of Prime Minister since May of last year. He is one of the few government leaders who are not members of the ruling Afghan People's Democratic Party.

According to reports, under the constitution of the Kabul regime, the head of state can take over the government upon declaring a state of emergency. Last Saturday, Najibullah declared a state of emergency and dismissed seven ministers and one minister-level advisor who are not members of the Afghan People's Democratic Party. These eight individuals have been replaced by members of the party's Central Committee. The following day, Najibullah announced the establishment of a 20-member Supreme Council, which he himself will lead.

Afghan resistance forces demand Najibullah's resignation and refuse to allow his party to play a role in the future government of Afghanistan.

　　喀布尔政权改组政府
    同时成立最高委员会
    抵抗力量要求纳吉布拉下台
    本报讯  据外电报道，阿富汗官方人士２０日透露，喀布尔政权总统纳吉布拉已经解除了总理穆罕默德·哈桑·沙尔克的职务，自己兼任政府总理。
    沙尔克自去年５月以来担任总理职务，他是没有参加执政的阿富汗人民民主党的极少数政府领导人中的一员。
    据报道，根据喀布尔政权宪法，国家元首一旦宣布实行紧急状态，就接管政府。纳吉布拉于上星期六宣布实行紧急状态，并且解除了不是执政的阿富汗人民民主党党员的７名部长和１名部长级的顾问的职务。这８个人都被该党中央委员会委员所取代。次日，纳吉布拉宣布成立一个由２０人组成的最高委员会，由纳吉布拉本人领导。
    阿富汗抵抗力量要求纳吉布拉下台，并拒绝他的政党在未来阿富汗政府中发挥作用。
