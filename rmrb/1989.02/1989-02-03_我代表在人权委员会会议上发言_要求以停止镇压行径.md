	I represent China at the Human Rights Commission meeting
	to demand an end to suppression

	Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, February 1 -- Today, China's Permanent Representative to the United Nations Office in Geneva, Qian Jiaodong, pointed out here that only after Israel stops suppressing the Palestinian people in the occupied territories, withdraws from the Arab territories it has occupied since 1967, and restores the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people, can Israel have the possibility of enjoying its independence and right to existence alongside the countries of the Middle East in a peaceful atmosphere.

	At the 45th session of the United Nations Human Rights Commission, Qian Jiaodong expressed appreciation and support for the efforts made by the Palestine Liberation Organization, Arab countries, and all other countries eager to achieve early peace in the Middle East to politically resolve the Middle East issue. Qian Jiaodong pointed out that the Israeli authorities, who bear the primary and direct responsibility for the Middle East issue, have remained indifferent to the repeated expressions of goodwill by the PLO for a peaceful resolution of the Palestinian question. They continue to implement an aggressive expansionist policy, refuse to withdraw from the Arab territories they have occupied, and increasingly brazenly violate the human rights of the residents of the occupied territories. He said, "Israel's stubborn insistence on an aggressive expansionist stance and trampling on human rights is the fundamental reason why the Middle East issue remains unresolved to this day."

	Qian Jiaodong demanded that Israel face reality, mutually recognize the State of Palestine, and, in line with the current trend of international détente, work with the PLO and Arab countries to convene an international conference on the Middle East to negotiate and resolve the Middle East issue.

　　我代表在人权委员会会议上发言
    要求以停止镇压行径
    新华社日内瓦２月１日电  中国常驻联合国日内瓦办事处代表钱嘉东今天在这里指出，在以色列停止对被占领土巴勒斯坦人民的镇压、撤出自１９６７年以来占领的阿拉伯领土、恢复巴勒斯坦人民的合法民族权利之后，以色列才有可能与中东各国一道在和平气氛中享受其独立和生存的权利。
    在联合国人权委员会第４５届会议上发言时，钱嘉东对巴勒斯坦解放组织、阿拉伯国家和其它所有渴望早日实现中东和平的国家为政治解决中东问题所进行的努力表示赞赏和支持。钱嘉东指出，对中东问题负有主要和直接责任的以色列当局对巴解一再表现出的和平解决巴勒斯坦问题的诚意无动于衷，继续执行侵略扩张政策，拒不撤出其占领的阿拉伯领土，并更加肆无忌惮地侵犯被占领土居民的人权。他说：“以色列顽固坚持侵略扩张和践踏人权的立场是中东问题拖延至今不能解决的根本原因。”
    钱嘉东要求以色列正视现实，与巴勒斯坦国相互承认，并顺应当前国际形势趋于缓和的潮流，同巴解组织和阿拉伯国家一起，通过召开中东国际会议进行谈判，解决中东问题。
