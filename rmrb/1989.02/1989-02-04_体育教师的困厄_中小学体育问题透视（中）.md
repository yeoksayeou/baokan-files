The Plight of Physical Education Teachers
— A Perspective on Middle and Primary School Physical Education (Part II)

In interactions with middle and primary school physical education teachers, the most frequently mentioned issues are those directly related to their personal interests. Misconceptions about physical education in society have led to prejudice against middle and primary school physical education teachers. Many teachers have noted that although they teach more classes and have heavier extracurricular burdens compared to other subject teachers, their compensation is lower. In some schools, the income disparity between physical education teachers and other subject teachers is as high as 1:7. Graduates from the same cohort from a physical education college who are assigned to be coaches earn 1-2 salary grades higher than those who become middle school physical education teachers. Many middle and primary school physical education teachers are disheartened and are trying every means to transfer, leading to a severe loss of physical education teachers in middle and primary schools. Since 1982, one-third of the physical education teachers in Beijing's Xicheng District have switched to teaching other subjects or have been assigned to school-run factories, public security, and legal departments, with physical education teachers being the most enthusiastic applicants. Currently, the number of middle and primary school students in China is increasing, but the number of physical education teachers is relatively decreasing. If we use the student-teacher ratio of 1:720 as stipulated by the State Education Commission (Japan's ratio is 1:35) as a benchmark, Beijing alone is short of more than 800 middle and primary school physical education teachers. Last year, only 3 physical education graduates were assigned to Chaoyang District, but only one reported for duty, and even that one eventually left. A survey of graduates from a physical education college found that only one was willing to teach physical education in a middle school. It is evident that middle and primary school physical education in China is facing a crisis of a lack of successors.

Everyone hopes that their labor will be recognized and their achievements respected. However, the greatest dissatisfaction among middle and primary school physical education teachers lies in this area. The national college entrance examination standards lack a mandatory requirement for physical education scores, and students can still be admitted without physical education scores, or even have their physical education scores arbitrarily changed with the approval of the principal. This damages the enthusiasm of middle and primary school physical education teachers.

Middle and primary school physical education teachers are not only in short supply but also their quality is relatively declining. Among the 250,000 physical education teachers nationwide, only 10% have received higher education, and most of these key teachers are already in their fifties. In contrast, in the United States or Japan, 100% of middle and primary school physical education teachers have received higher education and professional training.

Middle and primary school physical education teachers are the direct implementers of school physical education. Their sense of duty and quality determine whether school physical education can be successfully carried out. It is time to take measures to reform the treatment of middle and primary school physical education teachers, broaden channels, and improve their professional and cultural levels, and change society's perception of physical education teachers. Otherwise, improving students' physical fitness will remain an empty promise, and the goal of becoming a sports powerhouse and the Olympic strategy will only be castles in the air.

　　体育教师的困厄
　　——中小学体育问题透视（中）
    在与中小学体育教师的接触中，听到反映最多的是与他们切身利益相关的问题。社会对体育观念的误解，导致了对中、小学体育教师的偏见。许多体育教师反映，虽然他们比其他课任教师的课上得多，课外负担更重，但报酬却更低。有的学校体育教师与其他课任教师的收入悬殊比例为１∶７。同一届体院毕业的学生，分配当教练比当中学体育教师工资高１—２档。一些中小学体育教师伤心失望，想尽办法搞调动，致使中小学校体育师资严重流失。北京市西城区自１９８２年以来，１／３的体育教师改教其他科目或到校办工厂，公安、政法等部门招干，报名最踊跃的往往是中小学体育教师。目前，我国中小学生在校人数愈来愈多，而体育教师却相对愈来愈少。如果按国家教委规定的师生比例１∶７２０（日本为１∶３５）来衡量的话，仅北京城区就缺８００多名中小学体育教师。去年分配到北京朝阳区３名体育专业毕业生，可报到的只有一人，最后连仅有的这一人也走了。有一所体院调查其毕业生，发现只有一人表示愿意到中学当体育教师。可见，我国中小学体育正面临着后继乏人的危机。
    每个人都希望自己的劳动价值得到承认，劳动成果受到尊重。然而，中小学体育教师最不满的正是在这一点上。我国的高考录取标准中缺少对体育成绩的硬性规定，没有体育成绩照样升学，甚至通过校长的批准而任意更改体育成绩。这就损伤了中小学体育教师的积极性。
    中小学体育教师不仅数量缺乏，而且质量也在相对下降。全国２５万名体育教师，受过高等教育的仅为１０％，这些骨干教师多数都已年届半百。而在美国或日本，中小学体育教师受过高等教育和专业训练的达１００％。
    中小学体育教师是学校体育教育的直接施行者，他们的事业心和素质决定着学校体育工作能否搞得好。现在该是采取措施，改革中小学体育教师的待遇，广开渠道，提高他们的专业与文化水平，改变社会对体育教师认识的时候了。否则，学生体质的提高就会成为空话，体育强国、奥运战略也只能是空中楼阁。
