The Polish government held a meeting on February 25 to discuss the disturbances that occurred in Krakow on February 24. The government criticized the "irresponsible behavior" of the young students.

According to Polish newspapers, on February 24, thousands of young students gathered in the central square of Krakow, Poland's second-largest city, to demand the restoration of the "Solidarity Union" that was banned in 1981. They also protested against the current efforts by the "Solidarity Union," led by Lech Wałęsa, to seek compromise with the authorities. After the rally, they held a demonstration march.

Prime Minister Rakowski pointed out at the meeting that the recent "street adventurism" in Krakow and Warsaw, among other cities, was contrary to the spirit of the "Round Table Talks," undermined the principle of dialogue, and damaged Poland's international reputation. Therefore, such actions must be resolutely stopped.

Rakowski also criticized the ongoing strikes and protests in various parts of Poland in a televised address on February 25. He stated that these actions were "worsening the situation," "aggravating inflation," and "leading to price increases." He hoped that the workers would recognize the harmfulness of strikes.

The Polish government will allow the Solidarity Union to publish the "Solidarity Weekly" and will permit Solidarity representatives to participate in the work of radio and television program committees and the press censorship bureau. This was announced by the chairman of the "Round Table Talks" media working group, government representative Jach. He said that once the Solidarity Union is reestablished, the government will implement these decisions.

Jach pointed out that in order to gradually establish a new order for mass media, the press law will be amended, and the third channel of television and the fifth channel of radio will be added.

He also said that to increase the transparency of the media and to meet the wishes of the majority of believers, the Polish Radio and Television Commission is preparing to broadcast live sessions of the parliament and church masses, subject to the approval of the Polish parliament and the Catholic Church.

Representatives of both sides welcomed the government's decisions at the February 25 meeting. Solidarity Union representatives considered this a concrete manifestation of media democratization but also stated that it only met part of their demands.

　　波政府批评克拉科夫学生闹事
    政府将同意团结工会出版刊物
    新华社华沙２月２５日电  波兰政府２５日开会，讨论２４日在克拉科夫市发生的骚乱活动，批评了青年学生“不负责任的行为”。
    据波兰报纸报道，２４日波兰第２大城克拉科夫有上千名青年学生在市中心广场举行集会，要求恢复１９８１年被当局取缔的“团结工会”，反对目前以瓦文萨为代表的“团结工会”力量同当局寻求妥协。会后又举行了示威游行。
    拉科夫斯基总理在会上指出，最近几天在克拉科夫以及华沙等城市出现的“街头冒险行为”，是违背“圆桌会议”精神的，破坏了对话原则，也损害了波兰的国际声誉。因此，必须坚决加以制止。
    拉科夫斯基２５日晚在波兰电视台发表讲话，再次谴责了骚乱行动。他指出，这种冒险行为破坏了波兰特别需要的社会秩序和安定。
    拉科夫斯基在电视讲话中还批评了目前波兰各地仍在不断发生的罢工和抗议行动。他指出，这些行动“正在恶化形势”，“加剧着通货膨胀”，“导致物价上涨”。他希望工人们能够认清罢工的危害性。
    新华社华沙２月２５日电　波兰政府将同意团结工会出版《团结周刊》，并将允许团结工会代表参加电台、电视节目委员会和报刊检查总局的工作。这是“圆桌会议”舆论工具问题小组主席、政府代表雅哈奇２５日发言时宣布的。他说，一旦团结工会重新成立，政府将把上述决定付诸实施。
    雅哈奇指出，为了逐步建立大众宣传媒介新秩序，将修改新闻法，增设电视台第３套节目和电台第５套节目。
    他还说，为了增加舆论工具的透明度和满足广大教徒的愿望，波兰电台、电视委员会准备在征得波兰议会和天主教教会同意后现场转播议会会议和教堂弥撒的实况。
    各方代表在２５日会议上对政府的上述决定表示欢迎。团结工会代表认为，这是舆论工具民主化的具体表现，但同时声称，这仅仅满足了团结工会的一部分要求。
