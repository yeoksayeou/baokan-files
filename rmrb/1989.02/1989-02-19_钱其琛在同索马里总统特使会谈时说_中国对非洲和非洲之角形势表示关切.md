Qian Qichen, in talks with the Special Envoy of the Somali President, said that China is concerned about the situation in Africa and the Horn of Africa.

New China News Agency, Beijing, February 18 (Reporter: Yang Guoqiang) Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said today that China is concerned about the situation in Africa and the Horn of Africa.

Qian Qichen, in talks with the Special Envoy of the Somali President, Muhammad Sheikh Osman, said that the Chinese government highly appreciates the normalization agreement reached in April last year between Ethiopia and Somalia. He believes that this agreement has created conditions for Somalia and other countries to overcome difficulties and develop their economies. The Chinese government hopes to see national reconciliation in Somalia.

Qian Qichen reiterated that the Chinese government and people attach great importance to the traditional friendship and friendly cooperation with the government and people of Somalia. He expressed his admiration for Somalia's policy of non-alignment and its support for the just struggles of the Arab countries and the people of South Africa.

Qian Qichen and Osman expressed satisfaction with the continuous development of friendly cooperation between the two countries.

During the talks, Osman briefed on the situation of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Third Central Committee of the Somali Revolutionary Socialist Party and introduced the issues in the northern part of Somalia and economic issues.

He said that the Somali government is willing to resolve the northern issue peacefully on the principle of maintaining national unity and territorial integrity, and is determined to continue the economic reforms that began in 1981 to develop the economy and rebuild the north.

In response, Qian Qichen emphasized that as long as Somalia's policy of developing the economy is in line with its national conditions, the Chinese government will express its support. He said, "Developing countries should take advantage of the current easing of international tensions to develop their own economies."

After the talks, Qian Qichen hosted a banquet for Osman and his delegation.

The Somali guests arrived in Beijing this noon for a working visit to China.

    中国对非洲和非洲之角形势表示关切
    新华社北京２月１８日电  （记者杨国强）外交部长钱其琛今天在此间说，中国对非洲形势和非洲之角形势表示关切。
    钱其琛在同索马里总统特使穆罕默德·谢赫·奥斯曼会谈时说，中国政府高度评价去年４月埃塞俄比亚和索马里达成的关系正常化协议，认为这对索马里和其它国家克服困难、发展经济创造了条件。中国政府希望看到索马里实现民族和解。
    钱其琛重申，中国政府和人民重视同索马里政府和人民的传统友情和友好合作。他对索马里奉行不结盟政策、支持阿拉伯国家和南非人民的正义斗争的立场表示赞赏。
    钱其琛和奥斯曼对两国友好合作关系不断发展表示满意。
    在会谈中，奥斯曼通报了索马里革命社会主义党三届四中全会的情况，并介绍了索马里北方问题和经济问题。
    他说，索马里政府愿在维护国家统一和领土完整的原则下，以和平方式解决北方问题，并决心把１９８１年开始的经济改革继续下去，以便发展经济，重建北方。
    对此，钱其琛强调，索马里采取的发展经济的政策只要符合索马里国情，中国政府都表示支持。他说：“发展中国家应利用目前国际上出现缓和的时机，发展各自的经济。”
    会谈后，钱其琛设宴款待奥斯曼一行。
    索马里客人是今天中午抵京来华进行工作访问的。
