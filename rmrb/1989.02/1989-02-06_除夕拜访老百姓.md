Visiting the Common People on New Year's Eve

Visiting an Old Worker's Home

Hearing that Master He Xinfu's son had recently gotten married, the reporter visited Master He's home on New Year's Eve.

Old He's three children and daughter-in-law are all workers. The banquet was set, and Master He raised his cup to toast, "This year's New Year has three joys: first, our family has a new member; second, our Shijiazhuang Changzheng Rubber Shoe Factory is ranked first in the nation; third, the prices during the Spring Festival are stable."

When the topic of prices came up, his wife started complaining, "Scallions, the free market price is 2.5 yuan per catty, no matter how expensive, we still have to buy them to wrap dumplings. Rice, 1.2 to 1.3 yuan per catty, it was never this expensive a few years ago!" Master He interrupted, "Prices have indeed risen, but our income has also increased. If you calculate carefully, our family's living standards have improved." He itemized the calculations, stating that the family's monthly income is over 800 yuan, and after purchasing some high-end goods, there is still some surplus.

The third son had a different perspective. He took a sip of wine and said, "'Official speculators' and 'private speculators,' if they are not dealt with, prices will not stabilize. It's a pity that they are not being dealt with strongly enough and decisively enough."

After a long silence, Master He slowly said, "Now some factory directors are too busy dealing with higher-ups and don't interact enough with the masses. Yesterday, Director Zhao insisted on toasting me, and I felt warm inside. Respecting workers is caring for them. It's even better than giving bonuses."

The Joy and Hopes of a Taiwanese Compatriot

At 6:55 PM on New Year's Eve, the reporter entered the home of the younger brother of Taiwanese compatriot Mr. Song, just as a family of four generations and seven people were having their reunion dinner.

"Since going to Taiwan in 1948, 41 years have passed, and this is the first time I've returned home for the New Year," said 63-year-old Mr. Song, looking at his 86-year-old mother beside him, his voice filled with emotion. The abundant dinner table was surrounded by his younger brother, sister-in-law, nephew, niece, and a 1-year-4-month-old grandnephew, a picture of familial harmony.

Since Mr. Song's first visit to Fuzhou in July 1983, this is his ninth time. Mr. Song said, "Fuzhou has changed so quickly. In the past, there were only state-owned stores, but now the streets are filled with shops, the cityscape is beautiful, and it is much more prosperous than six years ago."

Mr. Song also mentioned that in 1983, when he was strolling in Fuzhou, he couldn't find a place to eat at 1 PM, but now you can eat at any time in a restaurant. However, the service attitude of the shop assistants needs improvement, and sometimes they don't respond even after being called several times. But the prices are quite cheap, and a suit costs only one-tenth of the price in Taiwan.

"But it's still inconvenient now," said Mr. Song. "Originally, it's just half an hour by plane and a few hours by boat between the two sides, but it takes days to travel via a detour. Sometimes, waiting for a visa in Hong Kong can take more than 20 days."

Joy with a Touch of Reflection

On New Year's Eve, Tianjin's new train station was brightly lit, dazzling to the eye. Although passengers hurried, they couldn't help but take a few more glances at the scenery in front of the station.

"I'm a bit envious of the people of Tianjin. In the past, during the New Year, it was crowded here, with people standing in long lines outdoors in the cold. Now, at the peak times, 20,000 people can be accommodated smoothly, the waiting rooms have seats for everyone, and it's truly impressive. The renovation only took a year and a half, and if it had been delayed, it would have been a problem!"

"Tianjin people are efficient and decisive!"

Two Northeasterners walked and talked.

Passengers chatted:

"Who knows why, suddenly everything is tight." A young man sighed. Another middle-aged man interjected:

"I've been in the machinery industry for many years. But I've noticed: like in the past few years, a large amount of arable land was reduced, agriculture was neglected, and in university canteens, steamed buns and rice were thrown on the ground. I've felt for a long time: grain must be in short supply. Look, Tianjin Station is so strictly controlled..."

"Don't worry. We brought three bags of flour today, and tonight everyone will help make three-flavor dumplings. Don't throw away the wine bottles, they will be the rolling pins!" The train conductor, Liu Changgui, who has spent 11 years on the train during the New Year, announced, and the car immediately erupted in cheers...

"While the People Celebrate the New Year, We Face the Challenges"

When the reporter visited the dispatch room of the Wuhan Fire Brigade—119 Fire Alarm Center—on New Year's Eve, the scene was more bustling and tense than ever before. Fire alarms, fire alarms, one after another, poured in from all over the city. The on-duty personnel said, "While the people celebrate the New Year, we face the challenges."

Near the brigade, in the Jianghan Squad, soldier Wang Tao told me that last night he fought two fires, wetting two sets of clothes, and now he has no clothes to change. The combat uniform is just a regular raincoat, which easily lets in water, and the feeling in the cold winter is not good. But the soldiers' morale is still high, and they said tonight is "first-level readiness," wearing combat uniforms on the fire trucks, ready for battle.

"One Family Incomplete, All Families Complete"

The reporter, as the night fell, made a long-distance call to Faka Mountain and found Company Commander Chen Yonggan and his comrades.

Reporter: Commander Chen, at this moment when all families are reuniting, what do the soldiers of the garrison company think about the most?

Commander Chen: One family incomplete, all families complete. We think the most about standing guard for our motherland. This year's New Year's Eve, our company has added 12 dishes, holding a battlefield party in each trench and sentry post.

Reporter: What are the border soldiers most concerned about recently, what do they look forward to the most, and what are they most dissatisfied with?

Commander Chen: We are most concerned about the country's reforms, we look forward to our hometowns becoming prosperous, and we are most dissatisfied with corruption.

Reporter: Would you like to say a few words to your family members?

Sergeant Liu Zuolin: I come from a rural area in Henan, and I have been in the army for 6 years without returning home for a single Spring Festival. Please understand and forgive me, parents and brothers.

The frontline operator interjected: I suggest that the reporter add a sentence in the report: Long live the wives who are loyal to soldiers!

### 除夕拜访老百姓

　　除夕拜访老百姓
    在老工人家作客
    听说何新福师傅的儿子新近结了婚，除夕之夜，记者到何新福师傅家串门。
    老何身边的三个孩子和儿媳都是工人。酒宴摆下，何师傅举杯致辞：“今年过年有三喜：一是家里添了个人，二是咱石家庄长征胶鞋厂在全国同行业得第一，三是春节物价平稳。”
    提及物价，老伴发起牢骚：“韭菜，自由市场涨到二块五一斤，再贵包饺子也得买呀。大米，一块二、三一斤，前几年哪有这么贵啊！”何师傅抢过话茬：“物价是上涨了，但工资收入也多了，细算起来，咱家生活还是提高了。”他一项一项计算，全家每月收入８００多元，除购置一些高档商品外，还有点富裕。
    三儿子别有一番见地，他呷了一口酒说：“‘官倒’、‘私倒’，不治他们，物价就不稳。可惜，现在治得还不力，不狠。”
    沉默良久，何师傅缓缓地说：“现在有些厂长忙于应付上头，深入群众不够。昨天，赵厂长硬要敬我酒，我心里热乎乎的，看得起工人就是关心。比发奖金还高兴呢。”　　　　　（陈国琦）
　台胞的欢乐和期望
    除夕晚６点５５分，记者踏进台胞宋先生弟弟家门，适逢一家４代７口人正在吃团圆饭。
    “自从１９４８年去台湾，４１年了，还是第一次回老家过年。”６３岁的宋先生望着身边８６岁的老母亲说这番话，显得很激动。丰盛的餐桌边，围坐着他的弟弟、弟媳、侄儿、侄媳和１岁４个月的侄孙，一幅天伦之乐图。
    自１９８３年７月宋先生第一次回福州探亲算起，这次是第９次了。宋先生说：“福州变化真快。过去只见国营商店，现在满街都是商店，市容美了，比６年前繁荣多了。”
    宋先生还谈到，１９８３年他在福州逛街，下午１点找不到地方吃饭，如今，什么时候都能在饭店里吃到饭。只是商店服务员态度有待改进，有的叫几声还不答应。不过，东西相当便宜，做一套西装只有台湾价钱的１／１０。
    “不过现在还是不方便。”宋先生说，“本来两岸坐飞机才半小时，坐船才几个小时的路，却要绕道走几天。有时在香港等签证要等２０多天。”

　欢乐里有点反思
    除夕晚上，天津新客站遍体通明，光艳照人。旅客们尽管行色匆忙，还是忍不住多瞅几眼站前风光。
    “我真有点嫉妒天津人。往年年根走，这里挤成一团，露天排长龙死挨冻。现在这儿高潮时两万多人上下分流，井然有序，候车室人人有座，真叫盖了帽。改建才用了一年半，要是再慢一步，就玄了！”
    “天津人干事儿嗄、崩、脆！”
    两位东北人边走边谈。
    旅客们聊起来：
    “也不知怎么，一下子说紧就都紧起来了。”一位年轻人慨叹。另一位中年人插话：
    “我是多年搞机械的。可是我看出来了：像过去几年耕地大批减少，农业被人轻视，在大学食堂里，馒头、米饭扔一地。我早就感到：粮食非紧张不可。你看，天津站卡的多严……”
    “别着急。咱今天带了三袋面，今夜里大伙动手包三鲜饺子。酒瓶子别扔，那就是擀面棍！”列车长、１１年全在车上过除夕的刘长贵这一宣布，车厢里顿时一阵欢呼……。　　　　　　　（肖荻）
　“群众过年，我们过关”
    当记者除夕来到武汉市消防支队的调度室——１１９火警台，看到的是比以往任何时候都繁忙、紧张的景象。火警、火警，接二连三的火警，从全市各个方面涌向这里。值班的人说：“群众过年，我们过关。”
    在支队附近的江汉中队，穿着光棉衣的战士王涛告诉我，昨夜打了两次火，湿了两套衣服，现在没衣服换了。战斗服就是普通雨衣，很容易进水，寒冬腊月这滋味很不好受。但战士们情绪还是很饱满，他们说今晚“一级战备”，穿战斗服坐在消防车上，严阵以待。　　　　　　
　　　　　（龚达发）
　“一家不圆万家圆”
    记者于夜幕低垂之时，把长途电话挂到法卡山，找到连长陈勇敢和他的战友们。
    记者：陈连长，在这万家欢聚的时刻，守备连指战员想得最多的是什么？
    陈连长：一家不圆万家圆。我们想得最多的是一定要为祖国母亲站好岗守好岁。今年除夕，我们连队加了１２道菜，分别在各坑道和哨所举行战地晚会。
    记者：近来边防战士最关注的是什么，最盼望的是什么，最不满的是什么？
    陈连长：我们最关注的是国家改革，最盼望的是家乡富裕，最不满的是腐败现象。
    记者：你们是否愿意向家属说几句话。
    班长刘作林：我来自河南农村，入伍６年，没回家过过一个春节。请父母兄弟理解原谅我。
    前线话务员插话：我建议，请记者在报道中加上一句：忠诚于军人的妻子们万岁！
