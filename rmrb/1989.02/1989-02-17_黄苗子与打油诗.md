Last autumn, I visited Brother Huang and we chatted casually. I said, “From ancient times, fine scholars are like fine wine; one must seal the bottle tightly, otherwise the aroma will dissipate, and it will be no different from ordinary wine.” Before I could elaborate on my profound theory, Brother Huang seemed to be struck by something and suddenly left his seat, saying, “Nowadays, alcohol is expensive, and you are probably quite strapped for cash. Let me give you a bottle to try!” He then took out a bottle of fine wine from his cabinet and presented it to me. I was delighted in my heart and, without further explanation, gratefully accepted it and returned home. This was certainly a pleasant misunderstanding, but it also shows Brother Huang's sincere and genuine nature.

Brother Huang enjoys writing poetry. He has a solid foundation in classical poetry and his works are outstanding and widely admired by his peers. He also calls his poetry "comic verse," which I think is quite appropriate. There was a man named Zhang in the Tang Dynasty who was known as Zhang Daoyou, and his two lines about snow have been passed down for a thousand years: “Yellow dog on white, white dog swollen.” Thus, the term "comic verse" was established. However, I believe that "comic verse" does not necessarily have to adhere to a specific form but rather embodies a poetic spirit. True poets are often sincere and straightforward, and their poetry naturally exudes a sense of humor, somewhat akin to what Westerners call "humor." It can be called "comic verse."

Listen to this: Li Bai's “The clear wind and bright moon cost nothing, the jade mountain falls naturally, not pushed by man,” boasting in a grand and elegant manner, far from ordinary. Du Fu's “It seems like the spring breeze has deceived me, last night it blew down several branches of flowers,” complaining in such a pure and innocent way, full of childlike charm. As for Tao Yuanming's “I only regret making so many mistakes, you should forgive the drunkard,” it is so sincere and gentle, pure as fine wine; the realm is higher than the Western proverb written by the 19th-century American poet Edgar Allan Poe: “To err is human, to forgive is divine.” Those who are accustomed to writing self-criticism essays would feel ashamed in comparison. In my opinion, the above examples are all excellent "comic verse," and Brother Huang's "comic verse" should be understood in the same way. For example, in “Following the Rhyme of Jia Gong,” “How can one ride a horse and wave a whip as a guest, with the left leg to the east and the right leg to the west”; in “Gout in the Hospital, a Few Comic Verses,” “The wind of clouds and rain is painful, nine streams are in chaos, it is gout”; in “Visiting San Yi Weng,” “Do not say the golden bottle is polluted, the thousand-year tragedy belongs to the maternal line,” all are of this kind. The collection is full of such comic verses, and there is no need to list them all.

Brother Huang also titled his poetry collection “Cow Oil Collection.” I did not have time to ask him how he understands “cow oil.” As far as I know, “cow oil” is not the fat on a cow's body but a refined product from cow's milk, known as “white butter” in the West (translated from Shanghai dialect), which is rich in flavor and nutrition, and can be used to describe Brother Huang's poetic style. But I am not hinting that he should give me a jar of imported cow oil, readers be aware.

With Brother Huang's thick nature, he has also experienced hardships, been exiled to remote areas, imprisoned, and suffered injustices. But although he has gone through the most difficult times in life and is now over seventy, he still has a youthful appearance and unaging spirit, and his peers consider it a miracle. I have pondered this for a long time and recently finally understood two points. First, it is still due to his sincere and open-minded nature, able to “tolerate what the world cannot tolerate.” Second, it is because he can write comic verse, able to “laugh at what the world finds laughable.” In this way, his spirit is unobstructed, and evil cannot invade. Apart from this, there is probably no ancestral secret for longevity and youthfulness.

I particularly like to recite the two comic verses that Yang Gong Xianyi gave to Brother Huang: “Enjoy the prosperous times and do not rely on old age, wish for more money in the future!” I think that if one day Brother Huang becomes a billionaire, he will surely “shelter all the poor scholars and make them smile,” not to mention that I would also benefit greatly. Writing this, it seems like I am hinting at Brother Huang giving me wine again, so I will stop here.

　　黄苗子与打油诗
    吴甲丰
    去年秋访苗兄闲聊，我说：“从来佳士如佳酿，须将瓶盖紧紧塞住，否则香气散尽，亦与浊醪何异？”苗兄来不及听我发挥妙论，忽然似有所触，猛然离座说：“现在酒价昂贵，你大概也相当窘乏，我送你一瓶尝尝吧！”随即从柜中取出名酒一瓶相赠。我心中窃喜，也来不及对他多作解释，欣然拜领而归。这当然是一种可喜的误会，但也可以看出苗兄性情之真诚醇厚。
    苗兄喜欢作诗，他旧诗词功底很厚，故而作出来出色当行，友辈传诵。他又称自己的诗为“打油诗”，我看也很恰当。唐代有个张打油，有两句咏雪诗传诵千古，“黄狗身上白，白狗身上肿”，于是遂立“打油”之体。然而我认为“打油”不必硬性规定为一种体裁，而毋宁是一种诗的意趣。真正的诗人大多性情醇厚而真率，所作诗自然流露出一种俳谐之趣，略近西方人所说的“幽默”，谓之“打油”亦可。请听，李太白“清风明月不用一钱买，玉山自倒非人推”，吹牛也吹得豪爽俊逸，不同凡响。杜甫“却似春风相欺得，夜来吹折数枝花”，抱怨得又何等天真烂漫，憨态可掬。至于陶渊明“但恨多谬误，君当恕醉人”，更是何等的真切婉委，醇如佳酿；境界之高，超过了被美国１９世纪诗人爱伦·坡写入诗中的西方谚语：“犯错误是人性，宽恕是神圣。”那些惯写“检讨八股”的纱帽老生，则对之唯有自惭形秽。窃以为上述数例，均为“打油”之上乘，而对于苗兄的“打油”，似也应如此理解。如《步甲公韵》之“如何策马扬鞭客，左腿朝东右腿西”；《痛风入院，戏为数绝句》之“翻云覆雨风堪痛，九派栖惶是痛风”；《访散宜翁》之“莫说金瓶尽污染，千秋悲剧属娘行”，均属此例。集中此种打油佳句俯拾即是，不烦多举。
    苗兄又自题其诗集曰《牛油集》。他对“牛油”怎样理解，我不暇多问。据我所知，“牛油”并非牛身上的浮油，而是从牛乳中提炼的一种隽品，即西人所谓“白塔”（从上海人译音），其味醇厚而富营养，可喻苗兄诗品。但我如此品评，并非提醒他送我一罐进口牛油，读者明鉴。
    以苗兄性情之厚，亦曾磨蝎缠身，绝塞投荒，囹圄羁縻，抑何天公之不公欤？但他虽曾历人生难堪之境，且现已年逾古稀，却仍然童颜乌发，神情不衰，友辈都诧为奇迹。我几经揣摩，最近总算悟出两点。第一还是由于他性情醇厚而胸襟开阔，能“容天下难容之事”，第二是由于他会作打油诗，能“笑天下可笑的人”，如是则气不塞肠，诸邪难侵，此外大概并无养身驻颜的祖传秘方。
    我最爱诵杨公宪益赠苗兄的两句打油好诗：“欣逢盛世休倚老，预祝明朝更有钱！”我想，如果有朝一日苗兄能成为亿万富翁，必然“尽庇天下寒士尽开颜”，不必说连我也能受惠不浅。写到这里，仿佛又在暗示苗兄赐酒了，就此搁笔吧。
