Recently, due to the increase in market grain prices and the decrease in piglet prices, there has been a resurgence of indiscriminate slaughtering of sows among farmers. According to investigations, our township currently has 1,280 sows, which is nearly 400 fewer than the peak in 1978. If farmers continue to slaughter sows, pig production will face significant fluctuations again. This issue must be given serious attention by all levels of leadership and relevant departments.

　　制止宰杀母猪
    最近，由于市场粮价格上涨，仔猪价格下跌，农户中又出现了滥杀母猪的苗头。据调查，我镇现有存栏母猪１２８０头，比存栏量最高的１９７８年少了近４００头。如果农户再继续宰杀，生猪生产将会重新出现大的波动。这个问题必须引起各级领导、各有关部门的重视。
