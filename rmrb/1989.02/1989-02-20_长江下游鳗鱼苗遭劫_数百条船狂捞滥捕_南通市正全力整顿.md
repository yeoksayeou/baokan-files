Since late January, hundreds of large and small vessels have flooded the Jiangyin-South Tong 100-mile stretch of the lower Yangtze River, illegally fishing for eel fry. This has resulted in the devastating destruction of precious aquatic resources, obstruction of the Yangtze River navigation channel, and serious threats to the safety of passing ships. The critical coal supply for the state key project, the South Tong Huaeng Power Plant, is unable to dock, facing the danger of shutdown. To severely and swiftly crack down on these illegal activities, the South Tong Municipal People's Government has organized law enforcement personnel from the fisheries, commerce, port supervision, and public security departments to take joint action starting today. They have already dealt with 92 such fishing vessels, confiscated over 200 fishing nets, and fined a group of lawbreakers. The illegally caught eel fry have been confiscated.

Due to the unusually warm weather, the eel fry have returned to the Yangtze River earlier this year. Driven by the high prices offered by smugglers in Guangdong and Fujian, where a single eel fry the size of a sewing needle can fetch over 3 yuan, the strong desire for quick profits has led lawless elements from Zhejiang, Anhui, and the Jiangsu coastal regions to take risks. They have set up camps on the vast river, fishing day and night without restraint.

What is particularly severe is that, under the protection of localism, many farmers along the river, who have no fishing experience, have joined the fray. They drive various unlicensed and unregistered boats without any safety or rescue equipment. Some township enterprises have neglected their normal production, hired personnel, and purchased fishing gear to engage in organized and planned fishing and smuggling of eel fry. The South Tong County Wu Jie Township stone processing factory has rented 13 transport ships from Huoqiu County, Anhui Province, at a high price. The factory leadership personally directed the operation and organized personnel to sell the fry.

Due to some grassroots officials in parts of the riverine counties and cities leading the way in fishing and smuggling eel fry, the crackdown efforts have encountered significant difficulties.

　　长江下游鳗鱼苗遭劫    
    数百条船狂捞滥捕　南通市正全力整顿
    本报南通２月１９日电  元月下旬以来，数以百计的大小船舶潮水般地涌向长江下游江阴—南通百里江面，非法捕捞鳗鱼苗，珍贵的水产资源受到毁灭性的破坏，长江航道受阻，过往船舶安全受到严重威胁。国家重点工程南通华能电厂到港的煤炭因不能靠泊面临停产的危险。为从重从快打击这种非法行为，南通市人民政府组织渔政、工商、港监、公安等部门执法人员，从今天起采取联合行动，已查处这类捕捞船９２条，没收网具２００多口，一批不法分子受到罚款处理，非法捕捞的鳗鱼苗被没收。
    由于天气偏暖，今年鳗鱼苗回游长江的时间提前，在广东、福建等地走私分子的哄抬下，一条缝衣针大小的鳗鱼苗，收购价高达３元以上。强烈的发财欲驱使着浙江、安徽以及江苏沿江地区的不法分子铤而走险，在宽阔的江面上安营扎寨，日夜狂捞滥捕。
    特别严重的是，在地方保护主义的掩护下，沿江不少毫无捕捞经验的农民，驾驶着各种无证无照、又无任何安全救护设施的船舶，加入了这个行列。一些乡镇企业置正常生产于不顾，雇用人员购置网具，有组织、有计划地从事鳗鱼苗的捕捞和走私活动。南通县五接乡石子加工厂高价租用了安徽省霍丘县１３条运输船，厂领导亲自上船指挥，并组织专人贩苗。
    由于沿江地区部分县市少数基层干部带头捕捞走私鳗鱼苗，给查禁工作带来很大困难。
