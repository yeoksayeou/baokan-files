	Feeling: Opening Up to the World
	— Reading Zhai Mo's "The Entanglement and Transformation of Beauty and Ugliness"
	Yin Shuangxi

	After reading Zhai Mo's new book on aesthetics and art, "The Entanglement and Transformation of Beauty and Ugliness," I feel that the most striking aspect is the author's bold openness to the world through his artistic sensibilities. Aesthetician Ye Lang once proposed that theorists should possess a "theoretical sense," being able to grasp the most meaningful theoretical points from many materials. I think that for art theorists, this "theoretical sense" perhaps lies within the realm of artistic feelings and emotions. The British philosopher Wittgenstein once asked, "If the function of art is to 'awaken emotions,' does the consciousness of understanding art include these emotions?" He firmly believed that some questions are ones that no philosopher has ever encountered, but only artists like Beethoven can solve. This contains a highly important ontological proposition: artists and art theorists, through their own feelings, can achieve a "truthful grasp" of the world on the same level as speculative philosophy. The most influential philosopher of this century, Heidegger, often lectured on the poet Hölderlin in his university lectures, reflecting the historical trend of contemporary philosophy and aesthetics valuing artistic research. In this light, Zhai Mo's exploration of the aesthetic world from the perspective of feelings, which he calls "sensory gymnastics," not only has methodological value but also ontological significance.

	In this 140,000-word work, Zhai Mo, with his leaping thoughts, keen perceptions, and clear, sharp pen, explores the arts and beauty in a boundless and profound manner, revealing the unique scenery of art and beauty. There are many delicate and precise passages that make one suddenly enlightened; there are also humorous and insightful moments that make one smile and applaud. He seeks to explore the mysteries of philosophy with poetic prose, proposing original discoveries and views such as "the origin of beauty and the origin of man are simultaneous"; "beauty lies in the recombination after the breakdown of subject and object"; "the value of ugliness is not in transforming ugliness into beauty, but in ugliness itself, as true ugliness is more powerful than beauty"; "food culture and agricultural aesthetics"; "eating and relational aesthetics"; "solitude and beauty"; "the human body and beauty," and so on. He re-examines many previously unquestioned doctrines from a new aesthetic perspective, prompting us to look at the familiar world with a fresh eye. He reinterprets idioms like "in full swing," "ten fingers connected," and "as close as brothers" from an aesthetic angle, making them shine with new and strange brilliance. As a middle-aged art theorist, the author has suffered from the shackles of old, rigid theories. The writing of this book is actually a record of his personal painful struggles and difficult transformations in his ideas. It reflects, from one side, the transition of contemporary Chinese aesthetics toward modern aesthetics, and the transition of contemporary art theory from monotony and dullness to facing life and reality in a pluralistic manner.

	It is worth noting that the author's writing is both profound and accessible, concise and clear, fluent and passionate, respecting and guiding the reader's psychological state. Clear segmentation and line breaks not only have a sense of rhythm and pace but also provide a visual pleasure, which is what Wen Yi once sought in the visual beauty of poetry. I think that academic works can indeed be deep and difficult to read without losing their academic value, but art books aimed at the general public should also advocate "readability" and "entertainment." Many recent art theory articles often make one "exhausted" to read, and most readers flee before they are "exhausted." This is not just a "language" problem but fundamentally a problem of the art theorist's understanding and expression of life forms. Kafka said, "The books we need are axes for the frozen sea within us." In this sense, the Shanghai Literature and Art Publishing House's publication of "The Entanglement and Transformation of Beauty and Ugliness," despite the cooling down of the aesthetics craze, was still voted by readers from various places as one of the top ten most popular books of 1988 in the Shanghai "Book News." This is undoubtedly a phenomenon worth the attention of the art theory community.

　　感觉：向世界敞开
    ——读翟墨《美丑的纠缠与裂变》
    殷双喜
    读完翟墨谈美说艺的新著《美丑的纠缠与裂变》，我感到最突出的是著者那大胆向世界敞开的艺术感觉。美学家叶朗先生曾提出，理论家应该具备一种“理论感”，善于从许多材料中抓住最有意义的理论敏感点。我想，对于艺术理论家来说，“理论感”也许就存在于艺术的感觉和情感之中。英国哲学家维特根斯坦曾经问道：“假如艺术的作用是‘唤醒感情’的话，领悟艺术的意识是否包括在这些感情之中呢？”他坚定地认为，有些问题是任何哲学家都未碰到的，而只能由贝多芬这样的艺术家去解决。这里蕴含着一个极为重要的本体论命题，即艺术家和艺术理论家经由自己的感觉，可以达到与思辨哲学同一层面的对世界的“真理性把握”。本世纪最有影响的哲学家海德格尔在大学讲坛上大讲诗人荷尔德林，反映出当代哲学和美学重视艺术研究的历史趋势。这样看来，翟墨将自己从感觉角度切入审美世界的探索称之为“感觉体操”，就不仅具有方法论的价值，而且具有本体论的意义。
    在这本１４万字的著作中，翟墨以其跳跃的思维、敏锐的感受、明快犀利的笔锋，海阔天空，探幽发微，展示艺术与美的异样风光。多有细腻精到之笔，令人恍然若悟；不乏幽默会心之处，使人微笑击节。他追求以诗情的笔墨去探求哲理的奥秘，提出了“美的起源与人的起源同时”；“美在于主客观打破后的重组”；“丑的价值不在化丑为美，而在丑本身，真实的丑比美更有力”；“美食文化与农业美学”；“吃与关系美学”；“孤独与美”；“人体与美”等富有创见的发现和观点。对许多过去看来是天公地道，人皆不疑的信条，进行了新的审美反思，促使我们换一种别样的眼光去重新观看那熟视无睹的大千世界。对“方兴未艾”、“十指连心”、“情同手足”这些成（陈）语，从审美角度重新阐释，使之焕发出新颖奇异的光彩。作为一个中年艺术理论家，著者曾饱受旧的僵化理论桎梏之苦，这本书的写作，实际上是他个人痛苦思索，艰难的观念蜕化转变的心路历程。它从一个侧面反映出当代中国美学正在进行向现代美学的转变，当代艺术理论从单调乏味转向直面人生和多元化的现实。
    值得指出的是，著者的行文深入浅出，简洁明快、自如流畅、激情洋溢，尊重并引导读者的阅读心理。明确的分段与分行，不仅具有旋律与节奏感，也给人一种视觉上的快感，这正是闻一多早年所探求的诗的视觉美。我想，纯学术著作固然可以深奥难读而不失其学术价值，但面向多数人，注重普及中的提高的艺术书刊可以也应该提倡“可读性”和“消遣性”。近年的一些艺术理论文章，往往读来“累死人”，大多数读者在“累死”之前就匆匆逃离，这不仅是个“语言”问题，实质上是艺术理论家对生活形式的理解和表达能力问题。卡夫卡说：“我们需要的书，应该是一把能击破我们心中冰海的利斧。”从这个意义上讲，上海文艺出版社出版的这本《美丑的纠缠与裂变》在美学热已经降温的情况下，在上海《书讯报》上依然被各地读者评为１９８８年最受欢迎的十佳书籍之一，无疑是值得艺术理论界关注的一个现象。
