	Over a Hundred Uterine Fibroids Removed, Four Years Later, a Son is Born
		This report was filed by our newspaper. On January 14th of this year, Fa Mingzhu, who had 146 uterine fibroids removed four years ago, joyfully left the Qingdao Second People's Hospital with her newborn baby in her arms.

		This female worker at the Qingdao Foundry Machinery Factory had been married for five years without conceiving a child. At the age of 34, her abdomen began to swell, and she initially thought she was pregnant. Due to severe abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding, she sought medical examinations at several hospitals. The diagnoses were consistent: multiple uterine fibroids, which could only be cured by a total hysterectomy. At that time, Fa Mingzhu was extremely distressed.

		In 1984, Fa Mingzhu sought medical treatment at the Qingdao Second People's Hospital. The obstetrics and gynecology doctors carefully examined her and agreed to her request, deciding to perform a uterine fibroid removal surgery instead of a total hysterectomy that would render her permanently infertile. However, once the abdominal cavity was opened, the doctors encountered a challenge: a mass of fibroids, some as large as eggs, others as small as beans, densely packed together. With a high sense of responsibility, the doctors meticulously cleaned and removed each one. Post-surgery, they counted a total of 146 fibroids!

		This was a rare case in obstetrics and gynecology. To completely preserve the uterus and give the patient the possibility of pregnancy, the doctors performed reconstructive surgery after removing the tumors.

		Four years have passed, and the 38-year-old Fa Mingzhu finally realized her wish to have a child. The baby weighed 3800 grams.

### 子宫瘤摘除百余  四年后喜得一子

　　子宫瘤摘除百余
    四年后喜得一子
    本报讯  今年１月１４日，４年前曾摘除１４６个子宫肌瘤的法明珠抱着亲生的娃娃，兴高采烈地离开青岛市第二人民医院。
    这位在青岛铸造机械厂就职的女工婚后５年不孕。３４岁时，她的腹部渐渐大起来，一时误以为怀了孕。因腹痛难忍，加上阴道出血，她才到几家医院检查。诊断是一致的：多发性子宫肌瘤，只有施行子宫全切手术才能根治。当时，法明珠苦恼极了。
    １９８４年，法明珠到青岛市第二人民医院求医。妇产科医生仔细检查，答应了她的请求，决定施行子宫肌瘤摘除手术，而不做使其终生不孕的子宫全切。可是，一切开腹腔，医生们感到棘手了：一堆肌瘤，大如鸡蛋，小似豆粒，密密麻麻。医生们以高度负责的精神，一个个清理、摘除。术后一数，竟有１４６个！
    这在妇产科是一罕见的病例。为了完整地保留子宫，让患者有可能怀孕，摘净肿瘤后，医生们又作了整形处理。
    ４年过去了，３８岁的法明珠终于如愿生育，孩子体重３８００克。
