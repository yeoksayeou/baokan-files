The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has resumed its investigation into the moral conduct of John Tower, who was nominated to be the Secretary of Defense.

Before Tower was nominated by Bush to be the Secretary of Defense on December 16 last year, the FBI had conducted extensive investigations into allegations that Tower was a drunkard, had affairs with women, and had close ties with defense contractors. After the Senate raised new questions about Tower's private life, the White House authorized the FBI to resume its investigation of Tower yesterday.

The Senate Armed Services Committee, which was originally scheduled to vote on Tower's appointment on February 2, suddenly postponed the vote. This is because two members of the committee said they had obtained new information about Tower and needed to discuss it with the FBI.

　　美国联邦调查局重新审查托尔
    美国联邦调查局重新开始了对被提名为国防部长的约翰·托尔进行道德行为方面的审查。
    托尔在去年十二月十六日被布什提名为国防部长前，联邦调查局曾对有人指控托尔酗酒、与女人私通和同军工企业关系密切进行了大量调查。在参议院提出托尔私生活的新问题后，白宫昨天授权联邦调查局重新开始对托尔进行审查。
    参议院军事委员会原定于二日对托尔任命进行的表决突然推迟，因为该委员会有两名委员说，他们获得了有关托尔的新情况，须同联邦调查局讨论。
