    The "Children's Temple Fair" is a new feature added to this year's Beijing Temple of Earth Cultural Fair. Performances such as the children's self-composed and self-performed dances, martial arts, and puppet shows based on "Inspector Black Cat," "The Yang Family Generals," and "The Smurfs" have attracted many visitors. In the photo, children participating in the fair are seen playing games with the performer dressed as the "True and False Pig Eight Rules."

    The fair has been a hit with both children and adults, showcasing the creativity and talent of young performers. The event not only provides entertainment but also serves as a platform for cultural exchange and education. The organizers hope that such initiatives will continue to foster a love for traditional arts among the younger generation.
