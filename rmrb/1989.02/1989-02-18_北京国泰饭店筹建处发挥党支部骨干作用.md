　　北京国泰饭店筹建处发挥党支部骨干作用
    据新华社北京２月１７日电  中国国际信托投资公司下属的国泰饭店筹建处充分发挥党支部战斗堡垒作用和党员的先锋模范作用，在完成近万平方米国泰饭店的主体工程建设的过程中，使党组织在群众中的威望不断加强。
    这个筹建处现在管理的人员中工作地点很分散，有的在京城大厦工地筹建处、驼房营库房，有的在各种房地产公司、办公厅、贸易公司和大厦管理公司，还有７０多人一直在家待命，由于党支部抓紧职工的思想教育、纪律教育、法制教育，几年来不仅没有违法违纪的现象发生，同时一些后进的同志也向好的方面转化。
    这个筹建处的党支部不断完善党的组织建设和思想建设，健全组织生活制度，保证了党员的学习制度，党支部的战斗堡垒作用不断加强。他们在企业中制定了规章制度和整顿工作纪律，通过建章理制，从领导做起互相监督、明确职责。
