The festive atmosphere of drumming and firecrackers during the end-of-year and New Year military support and veteran care activities in various regions has "cooled down," with fewer formal visits and more practical efforts to address the needs of the military.

At the beginning of the new year, local party and government leaders have been visiting the local garrison troops to gather opinions and address the difficulties faced by the military and its personnel. Leaders from Fujian Province visited the local troops and, upon learning about the harsh living conditions and agricultural production challenges faced by units stationed in high mountains and islands, decided to allocate funds from the provincial budget to support the military's agricultural production. Leaders from the Hainan Provincial Committee seriously listened to the opinions of representatives from the Hainan Military Region and immediately decided on solutions to the problems. Leaders visiting the troops stationed in the Nansha and Xisha Islands proposed plans to quickly address issues related to food supplies and fuel for cooking.

According to incomplete statistics from 16 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, more than 300 department-level officials have visited military camps to handle issues on-site since the beginning of the year. In Shandong Province, leaders from 18 departments, including personnel, labor, public security, civil affairs, and commerce, formed a "one-stop service office" to visit the troops and discuss and decide on solutions for eight difficult issues, including ensuring the safety of training grounds and military supplies.

At the same time, various regions have sent officials to urban and rural areas to investigate the implementation of military support and veteran care work, summarizing experiences in using policies and regulations to protect military interests and support military construction. Guangdong Province, noting the uneven development of military support and veteran care work across the province and the inadequate implementation in some units, organized more than 20 provincial people's congress representatives to conduct investigations. They gathered feedback from the military and local opinions and studied solutions. Some places have established military support and veteran care service teams to provide practical assistance and warmth to the military and veteran care recipients.

　　减少礼节走访　多办好事实事
　　各地春节拥军优属活动简朴求实
    新华社北京２月５日电  （记者易俭如、通讯员刘文华）岁末年初各地拥军优属活动中鼓乐喧天、鞭炮齐鸣的热闹气氛有所“降温”，少了些礼节性走访，多了些扎扎实实为部队办实事。
    新年伊始，地方各级党政领导就陆续到当地驻军中征求意见，为部队建设和干部战士的生活排忧解难。福建省的领导同志来到驻闽子弟兵中间，听说一些驻守高山、海岛的部队生活环境艰苦，开展农副业生产遇到困难，便决定从省财政中拨出一笔资金，扶持部队开展农副业生产。海南省委负责同志认真听取海南军区机关代表的意见，当场拍板定下解决问题的办法。到驻守南沙和西沙部队慰问的省领导同志，就部队伙食和炊事燃料不足等难题，提出了尽快解决的方案。
    据１６个省、市、自治区的不完全统计，新年以来先后有３００余名厅局级干部登门到军营现场办公。山东省由人事、劳动、公安、民政、商业等１８个业务厅局的领导组成“一揽子办事处”到部队坦诚相商，当场定下办理部队提出的保障训练场地安全、部队供应等８个方面的“棘手事”。
    与此同时，各地还派出干部分赴城镇乡村调查拥军优属工作落实的情况，总结以政策、法规维护军队利益，支持军队建设的经验。广东省根据拥军优抚工作在全省发展不平衡，有的单位优抚工作不够落实的情况，组织２０多位省人大代表下去调查，既了解部队的反映，又听取地方的意见，研究解决的办法。一些地方还成立了拥军优属服务队，为部队和优抚对象办实事、送温暖。
