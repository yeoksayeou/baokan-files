Beijing Electron-Positron Collider Announces Good News: Achieves World's Best Brightness for Similar Accelerators

Beijing, February 17 (Xinhua) – Reporter Yang Lianghua learned yesterday from the Institute of High Energy Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences that the Beijing Electron-Positron Collider, representing the pinnacle of China's scientific and technological achievements, has once again brought good news—its electron-positron collision results have set a new world record for the best brightness among similar accelerators.

Brightness is a crucial indicator of the performance of an electron-positron collider. It refers to the number of particles that collide within a unit of time and cross-sectional area. The more particles that collide, the higher the brightness.

Inside the Beijing Electron-Positron Collider, electron and positron beams output from a linear accelerator move relative to each other at the speed of light within a storage ring, colliding at a fixed point hundreds of thousands of times per second. Due to their high speed and small size, the probability of collision is very low. This is often compared to "closing one's eyes and letting two strands of hair touch each other." To increase the number of collisions, the instruments and equipment must have an accuracy that is hard to imagine.

Professor Fang Shouxian, Director of the Institute of High Energy Physics, revealed to the reporter today that this collider has been running normally for over 2,700 hours, demonstrating excellent performance. In the 16 billion electron volt energy range, its peak brightness has reached 2 x 10^30 cm^-2 s^-1, surpassing all similar machines in the world. The Beijing Spectrometer, which matches the collider, has also been basically completed and is about to enter the collision point.

### 北京正负电子对撞机传喜讯  创世界同类加速器最佳亮度

　　北京正负电子对撞机传喜讯    创世界同类加速器最佳亮度
    本报北京２月１７日讯  记者杨良化昨天从中科院高能物理研究所获悉：代表中国科技尖端水平的北京正负电子对撞机又传出令人振奋的喜讯——其正负电子对撞结果已创下世界同类加速器的最佳亮度。
    所谓亮度，是衡量电子对撞机性能的重要指标，它是指在单位时间和截面内发生对撞的粒子数目，对撞粒子数越多，则称亮度越高。
    在北京正负电子对撞机内，由直线加速器输出的正负电子束团，以光速在贮存环内相对运动，定点相撞，每秒钟碰撞上百万次。由于运动速度高、粒子体积小，碰撞几率很小，人们把它比喻为“闭着眼让两根头发丝顶在一起”。要提高碰撞数目，仪器设备就要具有常人难以想象的精度。
    高能物理所所长方守贤教授今天向记者透露，这台对撞机目前已正常运行２７００多小时，表现了优异的性能。在１６亿电子伏能区，其峰值亮度达到２×１０的３０次幂厘米—２次幂·秒—１次幂，这一成绩比世界上同类机器都要好。与对撞机相匹配的北京谱仪也已基本建好，即将进入对撞点。
