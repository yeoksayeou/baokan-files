	With the deepening of the housing system reform, Shenzhen Special Zone has seen a surge in home purchases.

	As of January 25, the cadres and workers in Shenzhen Special Zone (excluding the Shekou Industrial Zone) have signed housing lease-purchase contracts totaling 10,770 units, accounting for approximately 25% of the total number of apartment-style houses in the entire special zone that are participating in the housing reform. Among these, 94.4% of the contracts signed by cadres and workers are for purchasing homes, and over 94.3 million yuan in down payments have been made. Despite the fact that an average of 150 purchase contracts are signed daily, the demand still cannot be fully met.

	The housing system reform that began in Shenzhen Special Zone on October 1 last year has four key features. First, the rents and prices of housing are set at the actual cost in one step, including the construction cost of the residential building, engineering management fees, and investment interest during the construction period. Second, the focus is on selling old houses, with both renting and selling options. This reform not only increased the rent for old houses from the original 0.14 yuan per square meter to 2.06 yuan per actual cost price but also clearly stated that future housing rents will float with market price indices. To encourage workers to buy homes, Shenzhen has also implemented policies and legal measures such as encouraging early purchases, early payments, low-interest bank loans, and granting ownership rights, inheritance rights, gift rights, and free trade rights.

	Third, cash transactions are conducted. All units handle housing subsidies, rents, and purchase payments for cadres and workers in cash, without using "housing vouchers" or similar forms of empty transactions. Fourth, there is a separation of government and enterprise responsibilities. According to the different economic income situations of cadres and workers in party and government institutions and enterprises, Shenzhen's housing reform plan is only implemented within party and government institutions. State-owned enterprises can refer to this plan to formulate their own housing reform plans, but they must proceed in sync with the housing reform in party and government institutions. It is also stipulated that the rents and prices of enterprises must be raised to the actual cost or full cost, and the housing subsidy standards must not exceed those of the same type in party and government institutions.

	Early action, thorough preparation, and a solid foundation among the masses are important reasons why the housing system reform in Shenzhen Special Zone has been smoothly implemented. It is precisely because of the extensive and in-depth investigation and research conducted on the historical and current situation of housing for special zone workers, as well as the repeated solicitation of opinions and revisions of the reform plan, that the masses have been well-prepared.

	Since the housing reform began last October, the personal savings balance at the Shenzhen Industrial and Commercial Bank has decreased by over 60 million yuan. However, the total savings balance of all banks in the special zone has not decreased, as these reduced personal savings have been transferred to the property units of housing.

### 住房租金和售价一步到位搞现金实转　深圳特区出现购房热

　　住房租金和售价一步到位搞现金实转
　　深圳特区出现购房热
    新华社深圳２月９日电  （记者蒋顺章）随着住房制度改革的深入展开，深圳经济特区出现了购房热。
    截至１月２５日，深圳特区（蛇口工业区除外，下同）的机关干部、职工已同房产部门和企事业单位签订租售住房合同１０７７０宗（套），约占全特区应参加房改的单元式住宅总数的２５％。其中干部、职工签订的购房合同占已签订租售住房合同总数的９４．４％，并交付部分购房现金９４３０多万元。由于干部和职工踊跃购买住房，现在平均每天签订购房合同１５０宗（套）左右仍然满足不了要求。
    深圳特区从去年１０月１日正式开始的这次住房制度改革，有四大特点，一是住房租金和售价“一步到位”，都以住宅的准成本计价（包括住宅本体造价、工程管理费和建设期间的投资利息三部分）。二是以卖老房为主，租售并举。这次房改不仅把老房的租金从原来的每平方米０．１４元提高到２．０６元的准成本价，而且明确宣布今后的住房租金将随着市场物价指数的变动而浮动。为了鼓励职工买房，深圳还制定了鼓励早买房、早付款和银行低息贷款，以及产权归己并享受继承权、赠与权和自由买卖权等优惠政策和法律措施。三是现金实转。各单位对干部、职工的住房补贴、住房租金和购房款，一律用现金发放或缴纳，不搞“住房券”之类的空转。四是政企分开。根据党政事业单位与企业的职工不同经济收入情况，深圳这次实施的房改方案只限于在党政事业单位内实行。国营企业可参照这一方案制定各自的房改方案，但必须与党政事业单位的房改同步进行。并规定企业的租金和售价必须提到准成本或全成本，住房补贴标准最高也不得超过党政事业单位的同类标准。
    动手较早、准备充分、群众基础扎实，是深圳特区住房制度改革得以顺利推行的重要原因。正由于对特区职工住房的历史与现状、经济收入等情况进行了广泛深入的调查研究，对房改方案反复征求意见、反复修改才出台的，群众的思想准备比较充分。
    自去年１０月房改以来，深圳工商银行的个人存款余额减少了６０００多万元，但全特区各银行存款结余总额却未降低，原因是这些减少的个人存款已转移到住房的产权单位了。
