Heilongjiang Province's situation education emphasizes "two-pronged approach": one hand focuses on propaganda and education, the other on rectification and order, achieving relatively good results. This experience is worth noting.

Combining situation education with rectification and order does not mean that all aspects of work in the field of rectifying the economic environment and order should be included in situation education. Rather, it means that situation education should be conducted alongside rectification and order to be convincing and effective.

Situation education involves various forms of propaganda and education, and the reasons are clear. Through propaganda and education, the broad masses of cadres and the people can enhance their understanding, master the correct methods of observing and analyzing the situation, break free from the limitations of local and temporary observations, have a clear understanding of the direction of the reform trend, and have a realistic understanding of the causes and solutions to the difficulties and problems faced. This is very necessary. Without the correct viewpoint and method as guidance, observing the situation will be like being in a fog, unable to find the center or distinguish the direction.

However, situation education is not just about delivering a grand theory or engaging in empty discussions; it must be closely linked with solving practical problems. In the next two years or even a longer period, it must be closely linked with the actual work of rectifying the economic environment, ordering the economic system, and deepening the reform comprehensively. The situation is not static or fixed; it is changing and developing. People's understanding of the situation is also not static. If you tell someone that their pessimistic view of the situation is wrong, you need to not only explain the reasons but also, through hard and solid work, gradually turn the situation towards a positive direction. Otherwise, it will be difficult to convince people.

Now, compared to five months ago, people's emotions are relatively stable. Of course, situation education has played a role, but more fundamentally, it is because our Party and government have formulated and implemented a series of rectification and order policies, and achieved certain results, making the situation develop in a positive direction and proving that the Party and government are not deceiving people. This is true for the entire country, and it is also true for a province, a city, or a county. Without decisive actions and results in rectification and order, situation education will find it difficult to convince people. On the contrary, it may exacerbate reverse psychology or cause dissatisfaction.

In situation education, implementing and doing well in the two-pronged approach is a manifestation of the spirit of "less talk, more action" and is the key to conducting situation education well. When situation education is being carried out, emphasizing and clarifying this point is very necessary.

　　形势教育与治理整顿一起抓
    本报评论员
    黑龙江省的形势教育强调“两手抓”：一手抓宣传教育，一手抓治理整顿，收到较好的效果。这个经验，值得重视。
    形势教育两手抓，并不是说要把治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序这个领域方方面面的工作都归入到形势教育中去，而是说：形势教育要同治理整顿一起抓，才有说服力，才能收效。
    形势教育要开展各种形式的宣传教育，其理由是很明显的。通过宣传教育，使广大干部群众提高认识，掌握观察形势、分析形势的正确方法，跳出囿于一时一地见闻的局限性，对改革大势的走向胸中有数，对面临的困难和问题所产生的原因和克服的办法有实事求是的了解，这是非常必要的。没有正确的观点和方法作指导，观察形势就会如坠云雾，找不到中心，辨不清方向。
    但是，形势教育仅仅是讲一篇大道理，坐而论道也不行，必须与解决实际问题紧密结合，今后两年或更长一个时期就是要与治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序、全面深化改革的实际紧密结合起来。形势不是静止的、凝固的，而是变化的、发展的，人们对形势的认识也不是一成不变的。你说人家对形势消极、悲观的看法不对，既需要讲道理，更需要通过艰苦、扎实的工作使形势逐步向好的方向转变，否则，就无法使人心服口服。
    现在较之五个月前，人们的情绪是比较安定了，这里当然有形势教育的作用，更根本的还是因为我们党和政府制定、执行了一系列治理、整顿的方针、政策，并取得一定的成效，使形势向好的方向发展，证明党和政府所言不虚。从全国来说是如此，从一省、一市、一县来说也是如此。没有治理、整顿的坚决行动，没有治理、整顿的成效，形势教育就难于说服人，相反，还可能激化逆反心理或引起不满情绪。
    在形势教育中实行两手抓，搞好两手抓，是“少说空话，多干实事”精神的体现，也是搞好形势教育的关键所在。当形势教育正在开展之时，强调这一点，明确这一点，十分必要。
