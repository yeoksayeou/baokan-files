The forestry production in the Bai Long River forest region, which was once on the brink of crisis, has shown signs of improvement. Currently, the afforestation area in this region has exceeded the logging area. Relevant authorities have decided to continue reducing the logging volume and expanding the afforestation area to ensure that the Bai Long River forest region remains green and can be sustainably utilized.

The Bai Long River forest region is located in southern Gansu Province and is one of the key forest regions in the country. In recent years, due to excessive logging and indiscriminate felling, the forest area has rapidly decreased, and the reserve resources have become seriously insufficient, which has caused concern and attention from all sectors of society.

    新华社兰州２月１１日电（记者屈维英）一度濒临危机的白龙江林区的林业生产出现转机。目前，这个林区的造林面积已超过采伐面积。有关方面决定继续压缩采伐量，扩大造林面积，保证白龙江林区青山常在，永续利用。
    白龙江林区地处甘肃南部，是全国重点林区之一。前些年由于过量采伐和乱砍滥伐，森林面积急剧减少，后备资源严重不足，曾引起社会各界的忧虑和关注。
