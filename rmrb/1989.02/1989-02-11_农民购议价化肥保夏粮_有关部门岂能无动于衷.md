Farmers Purchase Negotiated-Price Fertilizer to Protect Summer Grain

As of January 16th, the various townships in our county have yet to receive the supply plan for grain-oil linked, priced fertilizer. When they will be able to purchase priced fertilizer is still unknown. At this critical time for winter crop field management and applying fertilizer to ensure a high yield of summer grain, the over 500,000 farmers in our county are in a state of anxiety. Facing the high prices and scarcity of market fertilizers, the farmers, though frustrated, are still doing everything they can to purchase negotiated-price fertilizer at double the cost to meet the emergency.

Looking back at the grain procurement situation in 1988, and observing the scene of farmers in Chenwu Township purchasing negotiated-price fertilizer from the production materials store (see picture), can the relevant departments remain indifferent?!

### 农民购议价化肥保夏粮  有关部门岂能无动于衷

　　农民购议价化肥保夏粮    
    有关部门岂能无动于衷
    截至１月１６日，我县各乡镇还未见到粮油挂钩平价化肥供应计划，何时才能购到平价化肥，更是杳无音讯了。在抓越冬作物田间管理，追施化肥争取夏粮高产的当口，可急坏了我县５０余万农民。面对市场化肥价高货缺的情况，农民兄弟虽有怨气，但仍然千方百计地不惜花两倍多的票子购买议价化肥应急。
    回顾１９８８年的粮食收购情况，看看我县陈武乡农民在生产资料门市部购运议价化肥的情景（见图），有关部门能无动于衷么？！
