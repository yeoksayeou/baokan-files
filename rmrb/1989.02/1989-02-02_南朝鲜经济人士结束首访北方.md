	Chung Joo-yung said excitedly before boarding the plane, "This was a pleasant and meaningful visit."

	During his 10-day visit to North Korea, Chung Joo-yung toured several construction projects and factories, including the West Sea Barrage, and discussed issues such as developing the Kumgangsan tourist resources with relevant North Korean departments. He also returned to his hometown to visit relatives and friends.

	At a press conference last night, Chung Joo-yung commented that North Korea's construction speed is fast, and in many areas, technology has developed.

Regarding the issue of North-South dialogue and exchange, Chung Joo-yung said, "Of course, there are still obstacles at present, but as long as the North and South work together, deepen understanding, they will definitely succeed, because this is beneficial to national unity and peace."

	Chung Joo-yung is confident about the prospects of North-South trade, saying that once all obstacles are removed, both sides will achieve mutually beneficial trade.

　　南朝鲜经济人士结束首访北方
    本报平壤２月１日电  记者徐宝康报道：南朝鲜“现代”工业集团名誉会长、经济界著名人士郑周永一行今天圆满结束了对朝鲜的首次访问，乘飞机离开平壤。
    郑周永在登机前兴奋地说，“这是一次愉快而有意义的访问”。
    郑周永在朝鲜为期１０天的访问中，参观了朝鲜西海水闸等一批建设项目和工厂企业，同朝鲜有关部门商讨了开发金刚山旅游资源等问题，并回到故乡探望了亲友。
    郑周永在昨天晚上的记者招待会上评价说，朝鲜北方的建设速度是快的，在许多领域里，技术得到了发展。在谈到开发金刚山问题时，他说，这是一件很有意义的事情，关系到和平和统一，相信南朝鲜当局会同意开发的。针对朝鲜北南对话和交流问题，郑周永说，当然，目前还有阻力，但只要北南有志者共同努力，加深理解，一定会取得成功，因为这有利于民族的团结和和平。
    郑周永对北南贸易的前景充满信心，他说今后一旦排除了一切阻力，北南双方将会实现互利的贸易往来。
