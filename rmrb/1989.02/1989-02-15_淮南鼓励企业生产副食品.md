Facing the tight supply of side dishes in the city, Anhui Province's Huainan City has both promoted the production of side dishes in rural areas and encouraged urban factories and mines to establish breeding grounds, thereby easing the supply-demand contradiction of side dishes, reducing market pressure, and improving the lives of workers.

Huainan City is an energy city with a population of one million. There are 400,000 coal mine workers and their families alone, and the city's consumption of side dishes is very large. At the beginning of last year, the municipal government mobilized factories and mines to establish their own breeding grounds and organized the city's agriculture, animal husbandry, grain, feed, finance, and fiscal departments to provide corresponding services to enterprises.

Factories and mines are very enthusiastic about developing side dish production. In the past year, Huainan City has already had 25 large and medium-sized enterprises engaged in breeding production, with a total investment of more than 2.5 million yuan, a pig breeding volume of more than 1,500 heads, 100,000 poultry, and 300,000 fish.

　　淮南鼓励企业生产副食品
    本报讯  面对城市副食品供应紧张状况，安徽省淮南市既抓农村副食品生产，又鼓励城市厂矿企业兴办养殖场，从而缓和了副食品供求矛盾，减轻了市场压力，改善了职工生活。
    淮南市是一个拥有百万人口的能源城市，仅煤矿职工家属就有４０多万人，城市副食品消费量很大。去年初市政府动员厂矿企业自办养殖场，并组织市农牧、粮食、饲料、金融、财政等部门给企业提供相应的服务。
    厂矿企业对发展副食品生产很有积极性，一年来，淮南市已有２５个大中型企业搞起了养殖生产，总投资达２５０万余元，生猪饲养量１５００余头，家禽１０万只，养鱼３０万余尾。
