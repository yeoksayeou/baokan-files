Public opinion supervision faces challenges, all sides call for obstacles to be removed
Capital news and legal circles and relevant parties hold a symposium

BEIJING, Feb. 25 (Xinhua) -- The difficulties faced by news criticism and the arduous path of public opinion supervision have drawn close attention from society. On the afternoon of February 24, the Capital Legal Journalists' Association held a symposium titled "The Challenges Faced by Public Opinion Supervision" at the Beijing Hotel. Nearly 100 people from the capital's news, legal, disciplinary inspection, letter and visit, theoretical, and artistic circles participated in the symposium. The attendees emphasized: Political and economic system reforms cannot do without public opinion supervision, and the problems faced by public opinion supervision must be given serious attention by the whole society. Various obstacles should be removed.

Since the 13th National Congress of the Communist Party of China clearly proposed to further play the role of public opinion supervision, public opinion supervision has become a hot topic in various sectors of society, especially in the news industry. At the symposium, participants discussed the content, scope, levels, conditions, tolerance, functions, and principles that public opinion supervision should follow. They believed that public opinion supervision should include three main aspects: knowing about politics, discussing politics, and criticism. If public opinion supervision is done well, it will play an immeasurable role in preventing corruption and promoting the process of democratization.

Many comrades pointed out that the main challenges facing public opinion supervision at present are: interference from administrative authorities, abuse of power; irrational impacts, constraints of old ideas; the quality and sense of social responsibility of news workers; and the tolerance of various levels of society, especially the leadership.

Speaking reporters mentioned that they often spend a lot of effort writing critical articles, and in cases where the facts are accurate and in accordance with the law, these articles are often "killed" due to interference from higher-level leaders. When discussing the current phenomenon of suing reporters, reporters said that when we do critical reporting, we must be cautious and respect and protect citizens' personal rights. However, now some of those criticized use the excuse of infringing on their reputation rights to sue reporters and reject public opinion supervision. The attendees called for various levels of leadership departments and functional departments to support public opinion supervision work, respect, and protect the rights of reporters.

Legal professionals participating in the meeting believe that the law protects and supports news organizations in conducting public opinion supervision. Similarly, news workers should exercise their rights within the scope of the law. Relevant responsible persons from the Supreme People's Court and the Civil Trial Division of the Beijing Intermediate People's Court pointed out that when they handle cases of suing reporters, they always take a cautious attitude. For those lawsuits caused by legitimate criticism, or for those lawsuits caused by criticism due to work errors that do not constitute infringement, they persuade the plaintiffs to withdraw the lawsuit. If the plaintiffs insist on not withdrawing the lawsuit, the court will dismiss it according to the law. They also suggested that when news reports have major errors, news organizations should take active measures to handle them properly.

Several lawyers speaking at the meeting believe that public opinion supervision work is difficult, and reporters need to have courage, be realistic, and act according to the law. They expressed that when the lawful rights of reporters are infringed upon and they need help, they have the responsibility to help reporters seek justice.

More than 30 news organizations in the capital, as well as relevant personnel from the Central Discipline Inspection Commission, the Central Propaganda Department, the Office of the Central Committee and the State Council's Letters and Visits Office, the Supreme People's Court, and the Supreme People's Procuratorate participated in the symposium.

　　舆论监督面临挑战  各方呼吁排除障碍
    首都新闻法律界及有关方面人士举行座谈
    本报讯  记者王永安、李春雷、赵蓓蓓报道：新闻批评困难重重，舆论监督举步维艰，这一状况引起社会密切关注。２月２４日下午，首都法制记者联谊会在北京饭店举行“舆论监督所面临的挑战”研讨会。首都新闻、法律、纪检、信访、理论、艺术界近百人参加了研讨会。与会者强调：政治、经济体制改革离不开舆论监督，而舆论监督所面临的问题必须引起全社会重视，各种障碍应予以排除。
    自从党的十三大明确提出进一步发挥舆论监督的作用后，舆论监督已成为社会各界特别是新闻界的热门话题。研讨会上，与会者就舆论监督的内容、范围、层次、条件、承受力、功能、遵循的原则各抒己见。他们认为，舆论监督应包括知政、议政、批评三个主要方面的内容。舆论监督搞好了，对防止腐败现象，促进民主化进程起着无法估量的作用。
    许多同志指出，当前舆论监督面临的主要挑战是：来自行政的干预，权力的滥用；非理性的冲击，旧观念的束缚；新闻工作者自身的素质及社会责任感；社会各层次特别是领导层的承受力。
    发言的记者谈到，他们花费很大精力采写的批评稿件，在事实准确、合乎法律的情况下，往往因上级领导的干预，而被“扼杀”的事情并非罕见。在谈到目前社会上告记者热的现象时，记者们谈到，我们在搞批评报道时，一定要慎重从事，尊重和保护公民的人身权利，但现在有的被批评者以侵害了他的名誉权为由，动不动就告记者，拒绝舆论监督。与会者呼吁，各级领导部门和各职能部门要支持舆论监督工作，尊重和维护记者的权益。
    参加会的法律界人士认为，法律保护和支持新闻单位进行舆论监督，同样，新闻工作者也要在法律的范围内行使自己的权利。最高人民法院和北京市中级人民法院民事审判庭有关负责人指出，他们在受理告记者案时，始终持慎重态度，对于那些因正当批评引起的诉讼，或因工作失误但尚构不成侵权的批评所引起的诉讼，劝说原告撤诉，如果原告坚持不撤诉，法院就要依法予以驳回。他们还建议记者报道出现大的失误时，新闻单位要采取积极措施予以妥善处理。
    几位发言的律师认为，舆论监督工作难度大，记者们一要有勇气，二要求实，三要依法行事。他们表示，当记者的合法权益受到不法侵害需要帮助时，他们有责任为记者伸张正义。
    首都三十多家新闻单位，以及中纪委、中宣部、中办国办信访局、最高法院、最高检察院等部门的有关人士参加了研讨会。
