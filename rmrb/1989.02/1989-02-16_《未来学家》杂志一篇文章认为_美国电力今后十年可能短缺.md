    According to an article published in the January-February issue of _The Futurist_ magazine, by the end of this century, the United States may face frequent power outages due to electricity shortages, which could also harm the U.S. economy.

    The article states that in the coming years, the demand for electricity in the United States will continue to grow at an annual rate of 2% to 3%. However, many of the country's power plants are 30 to 50 years old, with outdated technology and failing to meet environmental protection standards.

    It notes that even if the demand for electricity increases at an annual rate of 1.4%, by 2010, the United States will need 250,000 megawatts of new generating capacity. This is equivalent to building 250 large thermal or nuclear power plants over the next 20 years. However, power companies are increasingly reluctant to build new facilities.

    The article says that while the energy outlook for the United States is not entirely bleak due to new technologies that will provide new methods of power generation, it is expected that in the future, more use will be made of natural gas and other energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power.

　　《未来学家》杂志一篇文章认为    
    美国电力今后十年可能短缺
    新华社纽约２月１３日电  据今年一、二月号的《未来学家》杂志刊出的一篇文章，到本世纪末，美国的电力短缺可能使美国遭到经常停电的威胁并使美国经济受到损害。
    文章说，在未来几年里，美国的电力需求将以２％到３％的年率继续增长。但是，美国的许多电厂已有３０年到５０年的历史，技术过时，并且不合环境保护的标准。
    它说，即使电力的需求按１．４％的年率递增，到２０１０年，美国需要２５万兆瓦新的发电能力，这就相当于在今后２０年内要建立２５０个大的火力发电厂或核电厂。但是，目前电力公司日益不愿意建立新的设施。
    文章说，由于新技术将提供新的发电方法，因此，美国的能源前景也不完全是令人沮丧的。它预期，将来会更多地运用天然气以及其他的能源，如太阳能、风力、水力发电等等。
