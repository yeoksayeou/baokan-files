Respect Public Opinion, Avoid Formalities, and Avoid Empty Rituals: Pingdingshan Conducts Comprehensive Democratic Evaluation of Cadres

The People's Daily, Zhengzhou, February 18 — Reporter Li Jie reports: In conjunction with the upcoming elections, the Pingdingshan Municipal Committee of Henan Province conducted a democratic evaluation of cadres, fully respecting public opinion, avoiding formalities, and not going through empty rituals. This comprehensive democratic evaluation of bureau and commission leaders has received widespread praise from the public.

Recently, in conjunction with the upcoming elections, the Pingdingshan Municipal Committee increased transparency in its evaluation and investigation of bureau and commission leadership teams. Instead of the old practice where leaders determined the list and the Organization Department handled everything, followed by sending people to quietly gather materials, they allowed all cadres to participate in the evaluation work. They first selected principled, knowledgeable, and impartial cadres from the People's Congress, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, county and district governments, and large and medium-sized enterprises to form several evaluation teams. These teams evaluated over 170 leaders from 45 bureaus and commissions. Upon entering an organization, the evaluation teams first informed the public of the evaluation methods, allowing the masses to "photograph" their leaders. During the evaluation, they first listened to the opinions of the leadership team members about each other, and then conducted anonymous voting and individual discussions with a majority of the middle-level cadres and a significant portion of the masses, allowing them to fully express their views. After the evaluation, when the Municipal Committee listened to the evaluation opinions, they invited the main leaders of the People's Congress and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference to participate, screening each evaluated individual. Finally, a unified opinion was formed for each cadre.

It is understood that this democratic evaluation avoided empty rituals and the influence of a few individuals, broadening the Municipal Committee's understanding of each evaluated individual and reducing the impact of subjective impressions. One bureau and commission leader who had been promoted out of turn received a majority of "unqualified" votes from the public, who believed he lacked leadership but could serve as a deputy. The Municipal Committee, based on the evaluation opinions, adjusted his position to a deputy in another unit. Pingdingshan's democratic evaluation of cadres was thorough and comprehensive, respecting public opinion. After the adjustment of the leadership teams was announced, the public generally responded positively.

　　尊重民意　不摆样子　不走过场    
    平顶山全方位民主评议干部
    本报郑州２月１８日电  记者李杰报道：河南省平顶山市委结合换届，对干部进行考评时，充分尊重民意、不摆样子、不走过场，全方位民主考评局委领导干部，受到群众好评。
    最近，结合换届，平顶山市委在对局委领导班子考评调查时，一改过去领导定名单、组织部包办，然后派人悄悄下去凑材料的老一套，增加透明度，让全体干部参加到考评工作中去。他们首先从人大、政协、县区机关和大中型厂矿挑选原则性强、熟悉干部工作、公道正派的干部组成若干考评组，对４５个局委的１７０多名领导干部进行民主考评，考评组进入单位后，首先向群众交底、亮出考评办法，让广大干部给领导“照像”。在考评中，他们先听取被考评领导班子成员相互间的意见，并采取无记名投票和与中层干部的全部、群众中的大部分个别谈话，让他们充分发表意见，考评结束后，在市委听取考评意见时，请人大、政协的主要领导参加，对每个被考评者过“筛子”，最后对每个干部拿出统一的意见。
    据了解，这种民主考评避免了走过场和个别人说了算，使市委对每个被考评者的认识透视度拓宽，不受主观印象的影响。有一位曾被破格提拔的局委正职在考评中，群众投“不称职”票的占多数，认为帅才不足，但可担任副职，市委根据考评意见，将其调整到另一个单位任副职。平顶山市这次民主考评干部，由于工作作的扎实、充分，尊重了民意，调整班子结果公布后，群众普遍反映良好。
