Fish Farmers No Longer Fear Sundays

On January 4th, your newspaper's fifth edition published the reader's letter "Fish Farmers Fear Sundays," which sparked a strong reaction in our town. Over ten fish farming households circulated that day's People's Daily, spreading the news. Now, several Sundays have passed, and not a single person has come to our town's fish ponds to fish. Fish farming specialists have expressed, "With media supervision, we no longer fear Sundays!"

　　养鱼户不再怕过星期天
    １月４日，你报第五版刊登《养鱼户怕过星期天》的读者来信，在我镇引起强烈反响。有１０多家养鱼户主拿着这天的人民日报奔走相告。如今已过去几个星期天，没有一人来我镇的鱼池里钓鱼。养鱼专业户表示：“有舆论监督，我们不再怕过星期天了！”
