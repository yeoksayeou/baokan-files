Lech Walesa calls for an end to strikes

Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, February 16 (Reporter Dong Fuseng): Former chairman of the Solidarity Trade Union of Poland, Lech Walesa, today called on workers to stop striking at a press conference held in Gdansk.

Currently, strikes have become common in Poland. In January this year, there were 173 strike incidents nationwide. Since February, the number of strikes has surged, with almost no day without new strikes, sometimes more than 10 strikes occurring in a single day. These strikes are mostly economic in nature, primarily demanding wage increases. The Polish government believes that these strikes are basically spontaneous actions by workers and are not manipulated by any political forces.

Walesa said at the press conference today that strikes will harm the country's economic system, weaken national development, and cause the country to fall behind.

　　瓦文萨呼吁停止罢工
    新华社华沙２月１６日电  （记者董福生）波兰前团结工会主席瓦文萨今天在格但斯克举行的记者招待会上呼吁工人停止罢工。
    目前在波兰，罢工已经成风。今年１月份，全国爆发了１７３起罢工事件。进入２月份以来，罢工事件更是猛增，几乎没有一天不爆发新的罢工，有时一天就爆发１０多起罢工。这些罢工基本都是经济性质的，主要是要求提高工资。波兰政府认为，这些罢工基本上是工人自发举行的，没有受任何政治势力操纵。
    瓦文萨今天在记者招待会上说，罢工会伤害国家的经济机体，削弱国家的发展，使国家落后。
