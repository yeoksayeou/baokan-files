Hu Qili, Song Pian, and Kui Xiangwen today invited a group of factory directors and secretaries to discuss enterprise ideological and political work. Hu Qili pointed out that the current task is to accelerate the establishment of a new system for enterprise ideological and political work. Factory directors and secretaries should quickly take up their positions and should not waver.

Hu Qili said, "The 'Notice of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Strengthening and Improving Enterprise Ideological and Political Work' is an important document for strengthening and improving ideological and political work in the new situation of reform and opening up and modernization construction. The urgent task at hand is to implement the 'Notice.' Factory directors and secretaries must adapt to the new system and regulate the relationships between the Party, government, trade unions, and the Communist Youth League. Transitioning from the old structure to the new structure must be done actively and steadily, but the time should not be too long. All levels of Party and government leadership, as well as economic work departments and propaganda and ideological work departments, must treat the study and implementation of the spirit of the 'Notice' and the strengthening and improvement of ideological and political work as a major task. They must connect with the actual situations of various units and enterprises, formulate specific implementation plans, continuously summarize typical experiences, carry out ideological and political work at the grassroots level, and gradually develop and improve the new system and new structure of ideological and political work."

He said, "Our enterprises have formed a cadre team of ideological and political workers who have undergone long-term testing and tempering. In the process of establishing and operating the new system of enterprise ideological and political work, the cadre team of ideological and political workers is still an indispensable important force and should further play their leading role. All levels of Party and government leadership and enterprise leaders must care for and cherish ideological and political workers, create conditions for their work, and treat them equally in terms of remuneration with other enterprise cadres."

When discussing the content of enterprise ideological and political work, Hu Qili emphasized that enterprises should currently focus on advocating the creation of enterprise spirit and cultivating professional ethics. Enterprises should, through their strong ideological and political work, cultivate a group consciousness that has both social universality and enterprise characteristics. Currently, in conducting professional ethics education, it is necessary to advocate responsibility to society, a sense of ownership in labor, teamwork, mutual respect, and dedication to duty, so that workers in all industries strictly regulate their behavior with professional ethics.

The factory directors and secretaries who participated in the meeting believed that establishing a new system for enterprise ideological and political work is not only necessary but also feasible. In practice, most directors are capable of fully taking responsibility for ideological and political work. Currently, the work of implementing the 'Notice' in various places still has a significant gap with the requirements of the Central Committee. They expressed that ideological and political work needs to be innovated, enriched, and developed on the basis of inheriting good traditions. It should be connected with the actual thoughts of enterprises and workers, making ideological and political work more practical and effective.

Song Pian and Kui Xiangwen also spoke at the meeting.

　　胡启立谈企业思想政治工作
    抓紧建立新体制  厂长书记快到位
    据新华社北京２月２４日电  （记者吴士深）胡启立、宋平、芮杏文今天邀请部分企业厂长、书记座谈企业思想政治工作。胡启立指出，当前要加快建立企业思想政治工作的新体制，厂长和书记应尽快到位，不要动摇。
    胡启立说，《中共中央关于加强和改进企业思想政治工作的通知》，是在改革开放和现代化建设的新形势下加强和改进思想政治工作的一个重要文献。抓紧落实《通知》是企业思想政治工作面临的迫切任务。厂长和书记要适应新的体制，理顺党、政、工、团的关系。从旧格局进入新格局要积极稳妥，但时间不能拖太长，各级党政领导以及经济工作部门、宣传思想工作部门都要把学习、贯彻《通知》精神，加强和改进思想政治工作当成一件大事来抓。要联系各单位、各企业的实际，制订具体实施规划，不断总结典型经验，把思想政治工作做到基层，从而逐步发展和完善思想政治工作的新体制、新格局。
    他说，我们的企业已经形成一支经受过长期考验锻炼的政工干部队伍。在企业思想政治工作新体制建立和运行的过程中，政工干部队伍仍然是一支不可缺少的重要力量，应当进一步发挥他们的骨干作用。各级党政领导和企业负责人都要关心、爱护政工干部，在工作上创造条件，在待遇上要与企业其他干部一视同仁。
    在谈到企业思想政治工作内容时，胡启立强调，当前企业要重视倡导创建企业精神、培育职业道德。企业应通过自己强有力的思想政治工作，培育出既有社会共性，又有自己企业特色的群体意识。当前在进行职业道德教育中要提倡对社会负责、主人翁劳动态度、团结协作、互相尊重、尽忠职守，使各行各业的职工严格用职业道德规范约束自己的行为。
    参加座谈会的厂长、书记认为，建立企业思想政治工作的新体制不仅必要，而且可行。从实践看，大部分厂长是能够胜任全面负责思想政治工作的。目前各地贯彻《通知》的工作，与中央的要求还有较大差距。他们表示，思想政治工作需要在继承优良传统的基础上，创新、丰富和发展，要联系企业和职工思想实际，把思想政治工作做得更实在、更有效。
    宋平、芮杏文等同志也在座谈会上发了言。
