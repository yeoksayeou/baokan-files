Jiangxi's wage and bonus expenditures surge
Efforts needed to control consumption

According to statistics from the People's Bank of China's Jiangxi branch, in January of this year, the province's state-owned employees' wage expenditures increased by 42.9% compared to the same period last year. State-owned employees' bonus expenditures increased by 90.4%, and other individual expenditures by the state increased by 44.7%. These figures far exceed the province's economic growth and fiscal revenue growth rates. Urban collective units' wage and bonus expenditures, as well as other individual expenditures by urban collectives, increased by 38.6% and 74.8% respectively compared to the same period last year. Although the growth rates are slightly lower than those of state-owned enterprises, they are still significant and cannot be overlooked.

The reasons for the significant increase in wage and bonus expenditures are as follows:

- Rapid production growth has led to increased expenditure. Some enterprises have improved their performance and correspondingly increased their wage and bonus expenditures.
- The establishment of new organizations, increase in personnel, and expansion of expenditures. In some regions, the number of newly established grassroots financial institutions alone has reached 125 since last year, and expenditures have obviously increased.
- Officials and employees borrowing funds. Incomplete statistics show that in the Jiujiang region alone, officials and employees have borrowed over 30 million yuan in public funds. Across the province, 11 cities have significant amounts of public funds borrowed for private use.
- Due to the significant increase in prices since last year, the pull-type expenditure has expanded, affecting this year.
- Some units use false pretexts to withdraw cash, set up private funds, and use public funds for entertaining guests and dining. In some grassroots units, the practice of gift-giving has not been eradicated.

　　江西工资奖金支出猛增
    控制消费还需艰苦努力
    本报南昌２月１９日电  记者赵相如报道：根据人民银行江西省分行的统计，今年１月，全省国营职工工资支出比去年同期增加４２．９％，国家职工奖金支出比去年同期增加９０．４％，国家对个人其它支出增加４４．７％，远远超过全省经济发展和财政收入增长的比例。城镇集体单位工资、奖金支出，城镇集体对个人其它支出，今年１月与去年同期相比，增加３８．６％和７４．８％，增长的幅度略小于国营企事业单位，然而也不可等闲视之。
    出现工资、奖金支出大幅度上升的原因是：
    ——生产迅速发展，增加了费用开支。有的企业效益提高，相应增加了工资奖金支出。
    ——机构增设、人员增加、开支增大。有的地区，单是去年以来增加的基层金融机构就达１２５个，开支显然要上升。
    ——干部职工借支。据不完全统计，单是九江地区干部职工借用的公款就有３０００余万元，全省就有１１个地市，公款私借的数额就不是个小数。
    ——由于去年以来物价上涨幅度过大，推拉型的费用支出扩大，波及到今年。
    ——有的单位用假名目套取现金，私设小钱柜，用于公款请客吃喝，在一些基层单位送礼之风也没有绝迹。
