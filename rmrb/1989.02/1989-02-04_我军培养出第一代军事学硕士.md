The Navy Command Academy has trained the first generation of master's degree holders in military science for the PLA, who officially graduated on January 27.

Military science is a specialized discipline that studies military laws.

In September 1986, the Navy authorized the Navy Command Academy to enroll master's degree candidates in the fields of operational art and tactics for the first time. Five students, over a period of two and a half years, completed their studies in specialized and degree courses, as well as teaching practices and research investigations. They wrote more than 40 papers, all of which passed the assessment with excellent results.
