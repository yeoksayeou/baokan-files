    Reading "Accompanying Guo Moruo's Post-War Visit to Japan"
    Xue Yongnian

    In recent years, numerous works researching Comrade Guo Moruo's writings have been published, which is very encouraging. However, it is regrettable that there are few records of Guo Moruo's first visit to Japan after the founding of New China, leading a Chinese scientific delegation. Even when mentioned, some accounts deviate from the facts. Liu Deyou's book "Accompanying Guo Moruo's Post-War Visit to Japan: Memoirs and Records" (published by Liaoning People's Publishing House) fills this gap. This 270,000-word new work vividly and specifically recreates Guo Moruo's days and nights in Japan, serving as a precious historical record.

    In December 1955, the Chinese scientific delegation visited Japan, marking a new beginning for academic exchanges between China and Japan after the war. The delegation consisted of ten renowned scientists, including Guo Moruo, who was then the president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, as well as Feng Naichao, Qian Bozhan, Su Buqing, Mao Yisheng, Yin Da, and other experts from various fields such as history, mathematics, education, archaeology, and engineering technology. At that time, the state of war between China and Japan had not yet ended. Although after Kishi Nobusuke became prime minister in 1954, the two countries resumed civilian trade, and relations showed some improvement, cultural exchanges were still greatly constrained due to various internal and external factors in Japan. Academic figures such as the president of the Japan Academy, Mao Chengsi, and the former president of Tokyo University, Nan Yuanfan, overcame numerous difficulties to make this exchange possible. During the short visit, Guo Moruo undertook a great deal of work, making significant contributions to the development of academic exchanges between the two countries, enhancing mutual understanding between the peoples of China and Japan, and promoting the normalization of diplomatic relations. In the history of academic exchanges between China and Japan, this is a page worth recording in detail.

    Comrade Liu Deyou, as an interpreter, accompanied Guo Moruo in all activities. After Guo Moruo passed away in June 1978, Liu Deyou, with a heart full of respect for his predecessor and a sense of responsibility, wrote this rich and moving historical account in the form of memoirs and records. It is a faithful record of history.

　　读《随郭沫若战后访日》
    薛永年
    近年来，国内研究郭沫若同志的著作相继问世，这是令人十分高兴的。但遗憾的是，对新中国成立以后郭老首次率领中国科学代表团访日这一重要活动却记载得极少，即使提到，有的也与事实有些出入。刘德有著《随郭沫若战后访日——回忆与纪实》（辽宁人民出版社出版）一书，恰好弥补了这一不足。这部长达二十七万字的新著，生动而具体地再现了郭老访日的日日夜夜，是一部珍贵的历史纪实。
    一九五五年十二月，中国科学代表团访日，是中国学术界在战后同日本恢复交流的新开端。代表团由十名著名科学家组成，除当时担任中国科学院院长的郭老外，还包括冯乃超、翦伯赞、苏步青、茅以升、尹达等历史、数学、教育、考古、工程技术等多种学科领域的专家。当时，中日两国之间的战争状态尚未结束，尽管一九五四年鸠山一郎出任首相后，两国恢复了民间贸易，双方关系出现了一些好势头，但是，由于日本国内外的原因，双方的文化交流一直受到很大的制约。日本学术会议会长茅诚司、东京大学前校长南原繁等学术界人士克服了重重困难，才使这次交流得以实现。在短短的访日期间，郭老作了大量的工作，为开展两国之间的学术交流，为增进两国人民的相互理解和促进两国邦交正常化作出了巨大的贡献。在中日两国学术交流史上，这是值得大书特书的一页。
    刘德有同志作为译员陪同郭老参加了全部活动。郭老于一九七八年六月与世长辞以后，他怀着对前辈崇敬的心情，也是出于一种责任感，以回忆和纪实的形式写出了这一段丰富多彩、激动人心的历史。它是一部忠于历史的记录。
