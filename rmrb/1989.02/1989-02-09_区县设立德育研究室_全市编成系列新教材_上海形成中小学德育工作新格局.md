A new framework for moral education is gradually taking shape in Shanghai's primary and secondary schools. Currently, all 21 districts in the city have established moral education research rooms. The municipal education department has completed the compilation of a series of new textbooks for the six-year primary school thought and morality course and the six-year political course for junior and senior high schools.

This new set of textbooks emphasizes the integration of theory and practice, and after being promoted in primary and secondary schools, it has achieved good teaching results. Xue Ming Middle School is one of the first batch of pilot schools in Shanghai to use this set of textbooks. Over the past two years, the school's political teaching research group has carried out comprehensive reforms in textbooks, teaching methods, and assessment methods. It has been selected as an advanced school in national moral education work by the State Education Commission. They focus on strengthening the education of students' life ideals in moral education work, guiding students to carry out thematic discussions and speeches such as "Where is the value of life?" and "The best image of contemporary middle school students." It is reported that the school has had 15 students join the Communist Party of China.

Shanghai's primary and secondary schools also list social practice activities as an important part of moral education work and gradually institutionalize them. According to statistics, over the past two years, more than 100,000 high school students have participated in military training, agricultural work, and social investigations. During this winter vacation, more than 30,000 Young Pioneers took to the streets to carry out the "Civilized Youth in Action" campaign, focusing on respecting the elderly, teachers, children, and promoting new customs.

In reforming and strengthening moral education in primary and secondary schools, Shanghai pays attention to mobilizing society and families to participate in school education activities. Currently, there are more than 2,000 various types of parent schools in each district, forming a propaganda network composed of family, school, and society. The Shanghai Family Education Promotion Association frequently holds lectures and exchange meetings to disseminate and exchange information and dynamics related to family education. The association also collaborates with the Municipal Education Bureau to edit and publish the series of publications "Family Education for Middle School Students," "Family Education for Primary School Students," and "Family Education for Preschool Children," which are well-received by parents.

　　区县设立德育研究室　全市编成系列新教材
　　上海形成中小学德育工作新格局
    新华社上海２月８日电  （记者刘军）一个德育工作新格局正在上海市中小学逐步形成。目前，全市２１个区、县都设立了德育研究室。市教育部门已经编写完成了小学６年的思想品德课和初、高中６年政治课的系列新教材。
    这套新教材注重理论与实践的结合，在中小学推广使用后，取得了良好的教学效果。向明中学是上海市首批试用这套教材的试点学校。两年来，这所学校的政治教研组从教材、教法和考核方法等多方面对政治课进行整体改革，被国家教委评选为全国德育工作先进学校。他们在德育工作中着重加强对中学生进行人生理想的教育，引导学生开展“人生的价值在哪里”、“当代中学生的最佳形象”等专题讨论和演讲活动。据悉，这个学校先后有１５名学生加入了中国共产党。
    上海市中小学还将社会实践活动列为德育工作的重要内容，并逐步做到制度化。据统计，两年来，全市先后参加军训、学农和社会考察的高中生达１０万余人。今年寒假，３万多名少先队员走上街头，开展以敬老、尊师、爱幼、树新风为主要内容的“文明少年在行动”活动。
    上海市在改革和加强中小学德育工作中，注意动员社会、家庭参与学校教育活动。现在，各区、县共有各类家长学校２０００余所，形成了由家庭、学校和社会３方面力量组成的宣传网络。上海市家庭教育研究促进会经常举行报告会、交流会，传递和交流有关家庭教育的信息和动态。这个促进会还与市教育局合作，编辑出版了《中学生家庭教育》、《小学生家庭教育》、《学龄前儿童家庭教育》系列读物，颇受家长们的欢迎。
