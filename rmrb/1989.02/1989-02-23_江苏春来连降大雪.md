A prolonged snowstorm has brought an abrupt end to the spring-like weather in southern and northern Jiangsu, plunging the region back into the cold of winter. Just ten days ago, Nanjing's temperature had risen to 15 degrees Celsius, but today it has dropped below zero.

The snow began falling in the early hours of the 21st from the northern part of Jiangsu, moving southward. In the northern regions, snow accumulated to a depth of 15 centimeters. On the 22nd, the snowfall intensified, blanketing the entire city of Nanjing from morning till night. The ground was covered in a thick layer of snow, and streets were lined with deep snowdrifts. Pedestrians donned thick winter coats once again, and families rekindled their fireplaces. Children played in the streets, building snowmen and engaging in snowball fights. Shops selling spring clothing switched back to winter wear. The grand lantern festival along the Qinhuai River, which had drawn large crowds in the previous days, saw a significant drop in visitors tonight due to the heavy snowfall.

　　江苏春来连降大雪
    新华社南京２月２２日电  （记者袁养和）一场持续两天的大雪把已经春意盎然的苏南、苏北重新拉回寒冷的冬天。十天前气温已达摄氏１５度的南京城，今天的气温竟下降到零度以下。
    这场大雪是从２１日凌晨起由江苏北部向南降下的。苏北地区当天积雪深达１５厘米。２２日，雪下得更大、更猛，整个南京城从早到晚都笼罩在密密的雪网里，遍地银装，街上积起了厚厚的雪褥。行人重新穿上厚实的羽绒衣，居民家里重新生起火炉，天真的孩子在街道两旁堆起雪人，打起了雪仗。出售春装的时装商店重新出售冬装。秦淮河畔规模盛大的金陵灯会，前两天每晚都是彩灯如海，游人似潮，而今晚，雨雪霏霏，人迹稀少。
