    Accelerating the Cultivation of New Varieties
    The U.S. to Decipher Species Genetic Codes

    Washington, February 19 (Reported by Cang Lide) — U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Clayton Yeutter said that the U.S. Department of Agriculture will implement a large-scale plan to decipher the complete genetic codes of important agricultural crops and forest tree species. Yeutter stated that this multi-year plan is essential for the United States to maintain and strengthen its strong position in global agricultural benefits.

    Currently, most agricultural scientists still use methods that have been in use for hundreds of years, relying on plant hybridization to produce new varieties. This process often requires decades and thousands of hybridizations to screen out plants with the desired traits. Since the genes controlling these traits combine randomly in each hybridization, it is often impossible to determine whether the desired combination has occurred before the plant matures. Therefore, breeding superior varieties may require even more time. The goal of U.S. scientists is to clarify the genetic codes and their functions of certain species, and then redesign the code sequence as needed to cultivate new varieties in a short time.

　　加速培育新品种
    美将破译物种遗传密码
    本报华盛顿２月１９日电  记者仓立德报道：美国农业部长尤特说，美国农业研究所将实施一项大规模计划，破译重要农作物和森林树种的全套遗传密码。尤特称这项将持续多年的计划“对美国保持和加强其农业效益在全球的强劲地位是必不可少的”。
    目前大部分农业科学家还在沿用已有数百年历史的老办法，通过植物杂交产生新品种。在这一过程中，往往需要几十年时间、数千次杂交才能筛选出带有正确特性的传种植物。由于控制这些特性的基因在每次杂交中都是偶然结合的，在植物成熟前往往无法弄清所希望的结合是否已经发生，因此，培育优良物种可能需要更长时间。美国科学家的目的是要廓清某些物种的遗传密码及其作用，然后按照需要重新设计密码排列顺序，用短时间培养出新种。
