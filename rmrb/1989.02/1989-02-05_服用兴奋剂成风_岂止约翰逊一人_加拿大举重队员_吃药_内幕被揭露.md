The use of performance-enhancing drugs is rampant—Not just Johnson alone: The inside story of Canadian weightlifters' drug use is revealed

OTTAWA, Feb. 4 (Xinhua) — Former Canadian weightlifter Demos revealed on February 1 at a hearing investigating the use of performance-enhancing drugs by the Canadian weightlifting team that the team had used steroids smuggled from abroad before the Seoul Olympics and how they tried to evade drug tests. This incident has caused a sensation here.

Demos, 28, won a silver medal in weightlifting at the Los Angeles Olympics. He said that before the Olympics last year, when they were gathered in Vancouver preparing to go to Seoul, they suddenly received a notice that previous drug tests were invalid and that they needed to be retested. The coaches and athletes of the weightlifting team were taken aback. Someone suggested using a syringe to inject another person's urine into the bladder of the athlete being tested to evade the test. Demos took the lead in doing this, and three other team members followed suit. The so-called "clean" urine was provided by two senior coaches of the Canadian Weightlifting Association and a relative of a team member. However, this so-called "urine injection method" only worked for one out of the four on September 4, and the remaining three, including Demos, were still found to have problems and were disqualified from going to Seoul. Demos admitted that he had been using steroids since 1983, including winning the silver medal at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics with the help of drugs. He claimed, "Without drugs, you can't compete with athletes from the Eastern Bloc and Cuba. They all do it!"

Demos stated that before the Seoul Olympics, they went to two bases in Czechoslovakia for training and bought about 80 tablets of steroids from a Czechoslovakian coach for $50.

Demos is currently a construction worker. He was the first to testify at an eight-day hearing led by Ontario Supreme Court Judge Dubin. The Canadian weightlifting team is currently the most severely affected by the use of performance-enhancing drugs, and other individuals with issues will also testify in court.

　　服用兴奋剂成风　岂止约翰逊一人
　　加拿大举重队员“吃药”内幕被揭露
    本报渥太华２月４日电  记者郭文福报道：前加拿大举重队队员德莫斯２月１日在调查加拿大举重队服用兴奋剂问题的听证会上，揭露了加拿大举重队在汉城奥运会前服用从国外走私带入类固醇以及怎样设法逃过药物检查的内幕，此事成了这里一桩轰动性的新闻。
    德莫斯今年２８岁，曾在洛杉矶奥运会上夺得１枚举重银牌。他说，去年奥运会前，正当他们云集在温哥华准备去汉城的时候，突然接到通知说以前的药物检查无效，要重新检查。一时间，举重队的教练和队员们慌了手脚，他们一起在旅馆商讨对策。有人提出用注射器将别人的尿通过阴茎输入将被检查的运动员膀胱，以逃过检查。结果，德莫斯带头采用，另外３名队员也随之行动，而所谓“干净的”尿则是由加拿大举重联合会的两名高级教练以及一名队员的亲戚提供的。但是，这个所谓的“输尿法”在９月４日只对４个人当中的一个起了作用，包括德莫斯在内的其余３人仍被查出问题，进而取消了前往汉城的资格。德莫斯承认，他自１９８３年就开始服用类固醇，包括１９８４年洛杉矶奥运会取得那枚银牌也是药物起了作用。他声称，“如果不服药，就不能同东方集团和古巴的运动员们相竞争”，“他们都是这么干的！”
    德莫斯交待说，汉城奥运会之前，他们到捷克斯洛伐克的两个基地去集训，花了５０美元从捷队教练那里买了约８０片类固醇。
    德莫斯目前是一位建筑工人，他是在以安大略省最高法院法官杜宾为首的调查组举行的为期８天的听证会上第一个出来作证的人。加拿大举重队是目前被查出服用兴奋剂较严重的运动队，其他有问题的人也将出庭作证。
