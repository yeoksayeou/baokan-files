The Hungarian Party Central Committee Plenary Session has concluded its meeting tonight, and the communiqué has not yet been issued.

This plenary session, which has attracted attention both domestically and internationally, began yesterday. The main agenda item was the current political situation, particularly the evaluation of the October 1956 events.

On January 28, Politburo member and State Secretary of the Hungarian government, Pozsgay Imre, first proposed that the October 1956 events were not a "counter-revolutionary" event but a "people's uprising." His remarks immediately sparked widespread debate within Hungary, both inside and outside the party. Internationally, it also drew significant attention. Therefore, the Hungarian Party Politburo decided on January 31 to hold a Central Committee Plenary Session on February 10 to discuss this issue.

It is reported that due to the intense debates, the meeting, originally scheduled to conclude on the 10th, had to continue on the 11th. According to today's report from the Hungarian "Nép Szabadság" (People's Freedom), all issues in Hungary's political life were raised during the 10th's meeting. These included the establishment of socialist pluralism, the transition from a one-party system to a multi-party system, the evaluation of history, and particularly the political issues that have sparked domestic debate in recent days. The report stated that the discussions were broad, calm, and aimed at strengthening unity and clarifying issues.

　　匈党中央全会讨论国内政治问题    
    会议争论激烈　公报尚未发表
    新华社布达佩斯２月１１日电  （记者邹国昌）匈党中央全会已于今晚结束，会议公报尚未发表。
    这次引起匈国内外关注的中央全会是昨天开始举行的。会议的主要议题是当前的政治问题，特别是对１９５６年１０月事件的评价问题。
    １月２８日，匈党政治局委员、政府国务部长波日高伊首次提出１９５６年１０月事件不是“反革命”事件，而是“人民起义”。他的讲话立即在匈国内掀起轩然大波，引起了党内外广泛的争论。在国际上也引起广泛的关注。为此，匈党政治局１月３１日决定，２月１０日召开中央全会，讨论这一问题。
    据悉，由于会议争论激烈，原定１０日当天闭幕的会议不得不于１１日继续举行。据匈《人民自由报》今天报道，在１０日的会议上，匈国内政治生活中的所有问题都提出来了。其中包括建立社会主义多元化问题，从一党制向多党制过渡的问题，对历史的评价问题，特别讨论了最近几天引起国内争论的政治问题。报道认为，讨论是广泛的、冷静的，并具有致力于加强团结和澄清问题的气氛。
