What are Americans afraid of? Nuclear war, AIDS, economic crises, and "one more thing: the Japanese zeal for 'buying America,'" a U.S. businessman emphasized. No wonder, from the East Coast to the West Coast, wealthy Japanese are buying houses, land, companies, factories—"they buy whatever they want." Now they are eyeing American universities, which can't help but make Uncle Sam's heart race!

Actually, what American higher education is like and what it means to Japan is something the Japanese, who are always trying to learn from others and worry about their own shortcomings, know all too well. No one can say for sure how many talents Japan has cultivated using American higher education since the war. The American journalist Christopher, known as a Japan expert, once said: "Almost all the outstanding Japanese officials I know have studied abroad." Besides sending a large number of graduates to study in the U.S. and Europe every year, Japan has, since 1982, directly "bought" into the American university education system by establishing branch campuses. The courses in these branch campuses are all taught by American teachers in English. Statistics show that about 40 American institutions are currently in negotiations with the Japanese side over this kind of cooperation. Some Japanese people still firmly believe that Japan's primary and secondary education combined with American higher education can produce excellent talents.

In recent years, the U.S. has been burdened with heavy debts, and educational funds are lacking. Some universities are heavily in debt and struggling to maintain operations. Shrewd Japanese businessmen, while making money, have not forgotten to contribute to the development of their own country's education. They are seizing the opportunity to buy the chairs of the boards of these schools at high prices. According to reports from the U.S. media, relevant negotiations are being conducted in secret. For a university in Oklahoma that can accommodate 960 students, the offer has already reached $24 million. The Japanese have only one goal: to let more Japanese youth go to the U.S. to receive higher education.

Higher education has always been the foundation of America's strength. How can one's core competencies be sold so easily? Once the prestigious institutions known for their emphasis on research and achievements are bought out, technological wealth will continuously flow into others' pockets, which is akin to adding fuel to the fire. How can American educators not be worried?

There is one interesting point: just as the Japanese are trying to buy American universities, Japan's important educational reform document, the 1988 Education White Paper, is being released. The white paper emphasizes promoting international exchange and cultivating "Japanese people in the world." American education experts commented: "The education system of the 21st century will definitely be a 'globalized' system that is inclusive and comprehensive. In this regard, the Japanese have obviously taken the lead over many countries."

### 买房子　买地皮　买学校

　　买房子　买地皮　买学校
    丁刚
    美国人都怕些什么？原子战争、艾滋病、经济危机，“还得再加上一条：日本人那股子‘购买美国’的劲头”，一位美国商人如此强调。也难怪，从美国东海岸到西海岸，腰缠万贯的日本人买房子，买地皮，买公司，买工厂，“他们想买什么就买什么”，如今又眯着眼睛打量起了美国的高等院校，怎能不叫山姆大叔心跳？！
    其实，美国的高等教育是个什么模样，它对日本又意味着什么，对总爱捉摸别人长处，总是忧虑自己短处的日本人来说，简直再清楚也不过了。谁也说不准，日本在战后利用美国的高等教育为自己培养了多少人才。被称为日本通的美国记者克里斯托弗就说过：“几乎所有那些我所认识的出类拔萃的日本官员都留过学。”日本人除了每年选送大量毕业生去美欧留学，从１９８２年起又通过建立分校的方式直接“买”进美国的大学教育系统。这些分校的课程全部由美国教师用英语讲授。据统计，目前大约有４０多所美国院校正在就此种合作方式与日方谈判。一些日本人至今仍坚信，日本的初等和中等教育加上美国的高等教育就能够造就出优秀的人才。
    近年来，美国债台高筑，教育经费短缺，一些大学负债累累，难以维持。精明的日本商人在赚钱之余，并未忘记为本国教育发展效力。他们抓住机会，准备以高价买下这些学校的董事会的交椅。据美国报界披露，有关谈判正在悄悄进行，对俄克拉何马州一所可容纳９６０位学生的大学，出价已达２４００万美元。日本人的目的只有一个，就是让更多的日本青年去美国接受高等教育。
    高等教育历来是美国赖以强盛的根基。看家本领岂可随意买卖。素来重视科研而成果显赫的最高学府一旦被买去，技术财富便会不断流入他人囊中，无异于为虎添翼。美国教育界人士岂能不忧心忡忡？
    有一点颇有意味，日本人欲购美国大学之际，恰是日本教改重要文件１９８８年度教育白皮书出台之时，白皮书强调推动国际交流，培养世界中的日本人。美国教育专家对此评论说：“２１世纪的教育体系必定是一种兼容并蓄的‘全球化’体系，在这方面日本人显然已经走在了许多国家的前面。”
