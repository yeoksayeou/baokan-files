Farmer Li Fucheng and American Business Partner Establish Slaughterhouse Company

Li Fucheng, a specialist in cattle farming, is known as the "Cow King" of Sanhe County, Hebei Province. Recently, he has married into a "foreign family," partnering with the American Broadway Enterprise Limited Company to establish the "Fuhui Slaughterhouse Limited Company."

Li Fucheng, now 44 years old, began raising beef cattle in 1984. Currently, his cattle farm covers over 70 acres, and he exports 600-800 head of cattle annually. In November of last year, through the mediation of the Sanhe County Foreign Economic Cooperation Office, Li Fucheng reached an agreement with the American Broadway Enterprise Limited Company. Both parties invested 300,000 yuan each to establish the "Fuhui Slaughterhouse Limited Company" in Xinglongzhuang Village. Li Fucheng serves as the chairman, and the slaughtered cattle are directly exported to Hong Kong. Production has already begun, with an expected annual foreign exchange earnings of 580,000 yuan.

　　“养牛大王”喜结“洋亲”
　　农民李福成与美商合资创办屠宰公司
    养牛专业大户李福成是河北省三河县的“养牛大王”。最近他喜结“洋亲”，与美国百老汇企业有限公司合资创办了“福汇屠宰有限公司”。
    今年４４岁的李福成，从１９８４年开始养肉牛。目前，牛场面积达７０多亩，年出口肉牛６００—８００头。去年１１月，通过三河县对外经济协作办公室牵线搭桥，李福成与美国百老汇企业有限公司达成协议，双方各投资３０万元，在兴隆庄村东建立“福汇屠宰有限公司”，由李福成出任董事长，所屠宰的肉牛直接出口到香港。现已开始生产，预计年创汇５８万元。
