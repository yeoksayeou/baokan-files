Twenty countries participated in the 35th International Swimming Festival hosted by the East German Olympic Committee, which concluded on February 8. The host nation secured 20 out of the 24 gold medals. East Germany's renowned female swimmer, Otto, did not compete. Several other top athletes, still recovering from the fatigue of the Olympics, also failed to deliver strong performances.

China's delegation, consisting of 7 male and female athletes including notable swimmers Zhang Yong and Yang Wenyi, was also invited to participate. However, they did not compete in their main events. In the men's 50-meter freestyle race held yesterday, Chinese athlete Feng Qiang placed 7th with a time of 24.03 seconds. Overall, the Chinese team's performance was lackluster.

The Chinese swimming team will depart tomorrow for Bonn to participate in another international competition.

　　民主德国游泳节中国选手成绩平平
    新华社柏林２月８日电  有２０个国家参加的民主德国奥委会第３５届国际游泳节８日结束。东道主获得了２４枚金牌中的２０枚。民主德国著名女选手奥托未能参赛。另一些优秀运动员也因尚未完全从奥运会的疲劳中恢复，没有游出好成绩。
    中国由７名男女运动员组成的代表队也应邀参加了比赛，其中有著名运动员庄泳、杨文意等。但他们未参加主项比赛。在昨天的男子５０米自由泳比赛中，中国运动员冯强标获第７名，成绩为２４分０３秒。总的来看，整个中国队成绩平平。
    中国游泳队明天将离开这里前往波恩参加另一场国际比赛。
