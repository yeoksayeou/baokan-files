The Communist Party of China's Xianyang Municipal Committee in Shaanxi Province places great importance on the role of public opinion supervision, actively supports news organizations in conducting criticism, and seriously investigates issues raised and criticized by news organizations. This effectively helps to overcome bureaucratism, curb various undesirable practices, and promote various aspects of work.

After the 13th National Congress of the Communist Party of China emphasized the importance of public opinion supervision, the Xianyang Municipal Committee paid particular attention to this matter. They studied issues such as some departments and units not taking news organizations' criticisms seriously enough and not handling them promptly. Subsequently, the Municipal Committee issued a "Notice on Seriously Addressing News Criticism and Fully Utilizing News Supervision."

To keep track of news organizations' criticisms of the city's work, the Municipal Committee's office assigned dedicated personnel to watch and listen to news broadcasts daily, establishing a registration system. They recorded every article criticizing various aspects of the city, including it in the office's investigation and handling work, and promptly urged relevant departments to address the issues.

Last July, after the People's Daily, Shaanxi People's Radio, and Shaanxi Television reported the incident of farmers in Yiquan County having their orchard looted, Municipal Committee Secretary Zhu Xinnian wrote a letter to the county's Party secretary and mayor, urging them to take the matter seriously and take effective measures to resolve it. Relevant departments used this opportunity to draft regulations to protect the interests of contract operators, issuing them as notices or documents to educate officials and the public on legal matters. Mayor Zhang Hongxun rushed to the county to understand the investigation and handling of the situation, requiring relevant departments to cooperate. The Municipal Committee also sent Standing Committee member Ma Tieshan to lead a working group to Yiquan County to assist the county's Party committee and government in investigating and resolving the matter promptly.

For some complex issues raised by news organizations that involve a wide range of parties, the Municipal Committee requires relevant departments and units to jointly discuss and handle them. On June 17 last year, the Shaanxi Daily published a letter from farmer Wang Yisheng of Chunhua County, who had been running around for 16 months to claim a 16-yuan subsidy for selling live pigs but had not received it. After seeing the criticism, a responsible comrade from the Municipal Committee's office immediately looked into the matter and found that Wang Yisheng's issue affected a large number of farmers, but it was not something that the grain department alone could solve. Therefore, he instructed relevant comrades to call the Chunhua County Committee, requiring the county's departments to cooperate and resolve the issue quickly. The next morning, the county's Party secretary convened a meeting with responsible comrades from the grain, finance, commerce, and letters and visits departments to discuss the matter. The 16-yuan subsidy for selling live pigs was quickly delivered to Wang Yisheng and a large number of other farmers.

The Xianyang Municipal Committee also seized on some issues raised by news organizations that had general significance, using them as examples to promote work. Last August, the People's Daily exposed the case of a village Party branch secretary in Liangcun Town, Qian County, whose family had seven children. While urging the Qian County Party committee and government to handle the matter promptly, the Municipal Committee used this case to convene a city-wide meeting on "Strict Discipline and Implementation of Family Planning Policies." They dealt with a batch of Party and government leaders who violated family planning policies, which had a significant impact and quickly promoted the city's winter family planning work.

According to incomplete statistics, since last year, major news organizations at the provincial level and above have published or broadcast nearly 50 important articles criticizing Xianyang's work. Under the attention of leaders at all levels, the issues raised have been basically resolved, and the results have been reported back to the relevant news organizations.

　　批评稿件一一登记　揭露问题件件查处    
    咸阳市委借助新闻批评推进工作
    本报讯  中共陕西省咸阳市委重视发挥舆论监督作用，积极支持新闻单位开展批评，认真查办新闻单位揭露和批评的问题，以有效克服官僚主义、遏止各种不正之风、推动各项工作。
    党的十三大提出重视发挥舆论监督作用后，咸阳市委对此十分重视。针对本市一些部门和单位对新闻单位的批评不够严肃认真、不能及时查处等问题专门作了研究。随后，市委发出《关于认真对待新闻批评，充分发挥新闻监督作用的通知》。
    为了及时掌握新闻单位对该市工作批评的情况，市委办公室安排专人每天坚持收看、收听新闻，建立登记制度，把批评本市方方面面的稿件逐件登记，列入办公室查办工作范围，及时督促有关部门查处。
    去年７月，《人民日报》、陕西人民广播电台、陕西电视台等新闻单位报道礼泉县农民高良佐承包的果园被哄抢一事后，市委书记祝新民专门给这个县的县委书记和县长写信，要求他们重视，采取有效措施加以解决；有关部门借此拟定保护承包经营者利益的规定，以通告或文件的形式下发，对干部群众进行一次法制教育。市长张宏勋赶赴该县，了解查处情况，要求有关部门配合。市委还派常委马铁山带领工作组到礼泉县，协助县委、县政府查处此事，及时解决。
    对新闻单位批评的一些比较复杂、涉及面广的问题，市委要求各有关部门、单位共同协商处理。去年６月１７日，《陕西日报》刊登了淳化县农民王宜生的信，反映他为１６元交售生猪奖售的饲料粮差价，跑了１６个月仍未领到手一事。看到批评后，市委办公室负责同志当即了解，发现王宜生反映的问题涉及一大批农民群众，但不是粮食部门一家就能解决的。于是，他让有关同志给淳化县委打电话，要求县上各部门互相配合，尽快处理。第二天上午，淳化县委书记就召集粮食、财政、商业、信访等方面负责同志开会研究，１６元的交售生猪奖售饲料粮差价很快就送到王宜生等一大批农民群众手中。
    咸阳市委还抓住新闻单位批评的一些带有普遍性的问题，举一反三，推动工作。去年８月，乾县梁村镇一村党支部书记的家属连生７胎一事在《人民日报》上披露。市委在督促乾县县委、政府迅速处理的同时，抓住这个事例，召开了全市“严明纪律、落实计划生育政策”现场会，处理了一批违犯计划生育政策的党员领导干部，震动很大，迅速推动了全市冬季计划生育工作的开展。
    据不完全统计，去年以来，省以上主要新闻单位刊登、播发批评咸阳市有关工作的重要稿件近５０篇，在各级领导的重视下，所反映的问题基本上得到查处，并将结果回报了各新闻单位。
