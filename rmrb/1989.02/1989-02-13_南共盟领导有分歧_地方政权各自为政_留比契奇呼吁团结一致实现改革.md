South Communist Alliance leadership has disagreements; local governments act independently

Ljubičić calls for unity to achieve reforms

Xinhua News Agency, Belgrade, February 12 - South Slavic Federal Presidency member General Ljubičić called on the South Communist Alliance Central Committee leaders to sit down and clarify all disagreements. He emphasized that only through unity can social reforms be achieved.

Ljubičić made these remarks in an interview with the *Politika* newspaper. The newspaper today detailed the contents of Ljubičić's remarks.

When discussing the causes of the Yugoslav crisis, Ljubičić said that due to disagreements among some leaders of the South Communist Alliance, Yugoslavia lacks a unified political strategy. Even if agreements are reached on certain key issues, these agreements are not fully implemented. In such an atmosphere, the South Communist Alliance cannot adhere to democratic centralism.

Ljubičić criticized the independent actions of the republics and autonomous provinces. He said that Yugoslavia currently has 8 political centers (referring to the 6 republics and 2 autonomous provinces), which is not good. He stressed that Yugoslavia lacks a unified political line, creating favorable conditions for anti-socialist forces to operate.

The former defense minister expressed that despite concerns about Yugoslavia's future, he remains an optimist. He emphasized that the Yugoslav peoples, who fought to create this country, will not allow certain people to argue and conflict, leading to the disintegration of Yugoslavia.

　　南共盟领导有分歧　地方政权各自为政    
    留比契奇呼吁团结一致实现改革
    新华社贝尔格莱德２月１２日电  南斯拉夫联邦主席团委员留比契奇大将呼吁南共联盟中央领导人坐下来澄清一切分歧问题。他强调，只有大家团结一致，才能实现社会改革。
    留比契奇是在向《政治报》发表谈话时说这番话的。这家报纸今天详细报道了留比契奇的谈话内容。
    在谈到南斯拉夫危机的原因时，留比契奇说，由于南共联盟的某些领导人之间存在分歧，南斯拉夫没有统一的政治战略。即使就某些关键问题达成了协议，这些协议也得不到彻底贯彻。在这种气氛下，南共联盟无法坚持民主集中制。
    留比契奇批评各共和国与自治省各自为政。他说，南斯拉夫目前存在着８个政治中心（指６个共和国与２个自治省），这是不好的。他强调，南斯拉夫缺乏统一的政治路线，为反社会主义势力的活动创造了有利条件。
    这位前任国防部长表示，尽管人们对南斯拉夫的前途表示担心，他仍然是个乐观主义者。他强调，通过斗争缔造了这个国家的南斯拉夫各族人民决不允许某些人吵架和冲突而使南斯拉夫发生分裂。
