White House Reiterates Unchanged Policy Toward Soviet Union
		Calls Tor's Remarks Personal Views

		NEW YORK, Jan. 30 (Xinhua) -- The White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said today that the incoming U.S. Secretary of Defense, John Tower, comments on the Soviet Union in Munich do not mean that the U.S. government has changed its attitude toward the Soviet Union.

		Tower said two days ago at the NATO Munich conference that the Soviet Union remains a powerful adversary with military superiority. He also said that the modernization of short-range nuclear weapons is the foundation for the defense of the Western alliance.

		Fitzwater said that Tower's speech only reflects his personal views and does not indicate that the current government's broad review of policy has reached a conclusion.

		Regarding Tower's hardline stance and doubts expressed last week in the Senate Armed Services Committee on the "Star Wars" program, Fitzwater said those were his personal views. Once Tower takes office as Secretary of Defense, all policies and plans will be reviewed. Fitzwater said that President Bush has always supported the "Star Wars" program.

　　白宫重申对苏政策不变
    称托尔讲话只反映个人观点
    新华社华盛顿１月３０日电  美国白宫发言人马林·菲茨沃特今天说，即将上任的美国国防部长约翰·托尔在慕尼黑对苏联的评论并不意味着美国政府已改变了对苏联的态度。
    托尔于两天前在北约慕尼黑会议上说，苏联仍是占有军事优势的强劲对手。他还说，短程核武器的现代化是西方联盟确保防御的基础。
    菲茨沃特说，托尔的讲话只反映了他自己的观点，而并不反映现政府目前对政策的广泛审查已有了定论。
    就托尔上周在参院军事委员会上所持的强硬立场和对“星球大战”计划表示的怀疑态度，菲茨沃特说，那些都是他个人的观点，一旦他就任国防部长，全部政策和计划将受到审议。菲茨沃特说，布什总统一直是支持“星球大战”计划的。
