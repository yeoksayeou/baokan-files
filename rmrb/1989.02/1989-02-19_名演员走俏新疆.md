Famous actors are popular in Xinjiang. According to a report from our correspondent Zeng Kun in Urumqi on February 18, more than 60 famous actors and performing arts troupes from across the country have signed contracts to perform in Xinjiang this year. This follows the trend from last year when numerous famous actors came to Xinjiang to perform, creating another strong "northwest wind."

In the just-concluded Year of the Dragon, many famous actors who were popular nationwide formed teams to come to Xinjiang to perform. The China National Ballet and the cast of the television series "Dream of the Red Chamber" also traveled to Xinjiang. The theaters in Urumqi were almost always full. The gathering of so many cultural celebrities in Xinjiang is unprecedented. Border audiences, who could only appreciate the performances of famous actors on television screens in the past, now have the opportunity to see them live, broadening their horizons.
