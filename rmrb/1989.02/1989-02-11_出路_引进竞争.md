Title: The Way Forward – Introducing Competition

Each year, the audience is given a heads-up to lower their expectations: “Don’t expect too much!” But when the time comes to watch, everyone gets excited and happy, forgetting about the expectations. After watching, it’s inevitable to compare it with previous Spring Festival Galas. How was the Snake Year Gala? It was passable, that’s all.

Watching “Ode to Heroes,” my family of three generations, with vastly different levels of thought and culture, all ended up shedding tears. The maid, the Taiwanese singer, and the embrace of the three Taiwanese veterans—all three generations wiped their tears in unison. How can one find the resonance point of the hearts of billions of people on and off the screen, inside and outside the gala? This is a profound question.

“Recruitment,” “Lazy Man’s Blind Date,” and “A Day in the Life of a Heroic Mother” are the standout performances of the New Year’s Eve Gala. Exaggeration to the point of absurdity is something the audience has grown accustomed to and willingly accepts. It’s just that the satirical edge of these skits, observed from the perspective of “official hierarchy,” seems to be aimed at the county level and below. Only the riddle “Slip Three Things” did not specify the level.

China can be called a television powerhouse. Ordinary households own over a hundred million TV sets, and the Spring Festival Gala attracts over six hundred million viewers, making it one of the “world’s television records.” Even within a single family, there are differences in opinion, let alone among six hundred million people. It’s even harder to please everyone. However, the world is moving towards a harmonious era through television. There are indeed many commonalities in human nature. The differences in appreciation and the resonance of souls can achieve harmony and unity.

It’s a pity that as Beijing residents celebrating the Spring Festival, you have no choice but to watch television! Only this one option! Four and a half hours. Watch? It’s a compromise; not watch? You might miss something good. Just endure it! Isn’t that why it’s called “staying up late”? Originally, the Beijing station also arranged a gala for New Year’s Eve, but it was temporarily “yielded,” perhaps following the ancient virtue of being courteous, modest, and yielding? Guangdong not only has the provincial station but also the Zhujiang Station, Lingnan Station, and others. When television stations “compete,” there will be good shows.

The expectations for the Spring Festival Gala are getting higher, and future galas will be even harder to organize well. In the past two or three years, we have already seen the awkward situation of turning in narrow alleys on the old road. Television has been advocating reform and praising competition year after year. Why not introduce the competitive mechanism into the overall design and key programs of the Spring Festival Gala?

The Central Television Station has talents, power, funds, experience, and means of transmission… many advantages; however, advantages are not eternal, and they may or may have already turned into disadvantages. Once art is monopolized or becomes a lifelong position, it will definitely go from a small alley to a dead end.

For example, before this year’s “May 1,” publicly solicit bids nationwide (can be divided into segments for bidding), and focus the bidding objects on various provincial and municipal stations, various colleges and universities, various art troupes, and cultural institutions. In my opinion, without a breakthrough in institutional reform, there will be no leap in artistic innovation.

Thank you to the several program hosts who have been busy for us for several consecutive Spring Festivals; in 1990, let them go home and have a reunion year.

　　出路——引进竞争
    舒展
    每年都给观众在收看前打预防针降温：“不要期望过高！”到收看时共同激动欢乐，便忘了要求高低。收看后难免会与历年的春节晚会有个纵比，蛇年晚会如何？差强人意耳。
    看《英雄赞歌》，我家老少三代，思想水平文化层次大异其趣，但都在抹眼泪。小保姆、台湾歌星同台湾三位老兵的拥抱，三代人又不约而同地抹眼泪。怎样才能找到荧屏上下、晚会内外亿万人心的共振点，这是一门大学问。
    《招聘》、《懒汉相亲》、《英雄母亲的一天》等小品是除夕晚会骨干工程中的佼佼者。夸张到荒诞不经的程度，观众也习惯了，乐于接受。只是几个小品讽刺的锋芒所指，按“官本位”观察法，都是科级以下吧。只有谜语“溜三样”，没注明级别。
    中国称得上是电视大国，寻常百姓家共拥有一亿多台电视，春节晚会拥有六亿多观众，大约算得上“世界电视之最”吧。一家人尚且有口轻口重之差，何况六亿多人的口，当然更难调了。然而世界正在通过电视走向谐振的时代。人性相通处毕竟多得很。鉴赏的差异与心灵共振是可以达到和谐统一的。
    惜乎作为中国的北京观众过春节，看电视您别无选择！只此一家！四个多钟头。看呢，凑合事儿；不看吧，又怕漏掉好的。对付熬着吧！要不怎么叫“守岁”呢？其实本来北京台除夕也安排了一场晚会，但临时“让”了，大约是依着温良恭俭让的古训吧？广东不仅有省台，还有珠江台、岭南台及其他。电视台一“打架”，才会有好戏哩。
    对春节晚会的期望值越来越高，往后的晚会越来越难办好。前两三年已见到这一步在老路上狭小胡同里转悠的窘迫境况了。电视里年年表现改革，赞扬竞争。何不把竞争机制引到春节晚会总体设计、骨干节目的招标上来？
    中央电视台有人才、权力、资金、经验、传播手段……诸多优势；然而优势不是永恒的，它会不会向着或已经向着劣势转化？艺术一旦被垄断或成为终身制，必定从小胡同走到死胡同。
    例如在今年“５·１”之前，向全国公开招标（可以分段承包），把招标对象重点放在各省市台、各大专院校、各艺术院团和文化机关。愚以为，没有体制上的改革突破，便没有艺术构思上的飞跃创新。
    感谢几位节目主持人为我们连续忙活了好几个春节；在１９９０年该让他们回家过个团圆年了吧？
