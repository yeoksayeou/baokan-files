In 1988, Shanxi Province's total grain production reached 8.183 billion kilograms, an increase of 1 billion kilograms over the previous year. The total social product of the rural areas and the per capita net income of farmers both saw significant growth. At this time of bumper harvests and gains, Shanxi clearly sees the shortcomings and weaknesses in agricultural production and is taking effective measures to develop agricultural productivity, striving for significant development in agriculture.

Shanxi's agricultural production is highly susceptible to drought. From 1985 onwards, there were three consecutive years of drought, leading to a slide in agricultural production for three consecutive years. Due to the construction of energy and heavy industry bases and the development of township enterprises, there has been a structural imbalance in the development of industry and agriculture. As industry occupies more and more arable land, 480,000 mu (approximately 32,000 hectares) of farmland is reduced each year. The aging and lack of maintenance of water conservancy projects have led to a decline in their benefits. The water storage capacity of the province's water conservancy projects has decreased from 5 billion cubic meters before 1980 to 3.97 billion cubic meters in 1987. The province has reduced its irrigated area by 1.86 million mu (approximately 124,000 hectares).

In response to this severe situation, the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government have decided to invest 40 million yuan in water conservancy facilities over the next two years, restoring more than 20,000 severely damaged facilities. This year, the reinforcement and repair of 14 dangerous reservoirs will be accelerated, and the construction of a water-saving irrigation system, mainly using pipeline water delivery, will be promoted, aiming to transform 400,000 mu of water-saving irrigated farmland each year. The Wanjiaba Yellow River Diversion Project, which started this year, is scheduled to be completed by 1995. At the same time, key water conservancy projects such as the Songta Reservoir, the Qin River Diversion to the Fen River, and the second phase of the Yumenkou Project will be constructed. By 1990, the province aims to restore the effective irrigated area to 16.5 million mu (approximately 1.1 million hectares).

　　丰收不忘防歉收　眼前得利顾长远    
    山西采取措施推动农业生产
    本报讯  记者王艾生报道：１９８８年山西粮食总产量达８１．８３亿公斤，比上年增产１０亿公斤，全省农村社会总产值和农民人均纯收入都有较大增长。山西在丰收、得利的时刻，清醒地看到农业生产的不足和弱点，采取有效措施发展农业生产力，力争农业有较大的发展。
    山西农业承受干旱的能力十分脆弱，１９８５年以来连续３年干旱，农业生产连续3年滑坡。全省由于能源重化工基地建设和乡镇企业的发展，工农业发展出现结构性倾斜，由于工业占用耕地越来越多，每年减少农田４８万亩。水利工程老化失修，效益衰减，全省水利工程蓄水能力由１９８０年以前的５０亿立方米下降为１９８７年的３９．７亿立方米。全省减少灌溉面积１８６万亩。
    针对这一严峻态势，山西省委、省政府决定今后两年为水利设施每年投资４０００万元，使两万多处遭受严重破坏的设施得以恢复。今年１４座病险水库的除险加固工程也将加快进行，同时大搞以管道输水为主的节水灌溉体系建设，力争每年改造节水灌溉农田４０万亩。今年开工的万家寨引黄工程将于１９９５年完成。同时要建设松塔水库、引沁入汾、禹门口二期工程等重点水利工程，到１９９０年全省有效灌溉面积力争恢复到１６５０万亩。
