The United Nations Secretary-General, Javier Pérez de Cuéllar, today held a press conference in which he discussed the progress of resolving regional conflicts. He stated, "Now we can expect that Namibia will become the 160th member of the United Nations."

De Cuéllar expressed his "great satisfaction" with the Security Council's decision today to authorize the establishment of the "United Nations Transition Assistance Group." The "United Nations Plan for Namibia" is scheduled to begin implementation on April 1 this year, and Namibia will gain independence after one year. The assistance group will play a significant role in this process.

De Cuéllar mentioned that Steven Fanning, the police advisor for the assistance group, will arrive in Namibia tomorrow as the first member of the group. The commander and deputy commander of the assistance group's forces will depart for Namibia next week.

When asked about China's application to join the assistance group, De Cuéllar said, "We welcome China's participation in United Nations peacekeeping operations." He added that the request is under consideration. If China's application is accepted, it will be the first time China has participated in United Nations peacekeeping operations.

On the issue of Afghanistan, De Cuéllar said that after the complete withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan, he will continue to monitor the domestic situation in Afghanistan and hopes for national reconciliation. He pointed out that the United Nations still has three major tasks: (1) to supervise non-interference in the internal affairs of countries in the region and the return of Afghan refugees to their homes; (2) to help Afghanistan establish a government with a broad base according to United Nations resolutions; (3) to help rebuild this war-torn country.

De Cuéllar also mentioned that he might discuss the Afghanistan issue with U.S. Secretary of State Baker during a possible meeting in March.

When asked about the Kabul government's request to establish permanent observation posts along the border, he said that he is considering it, but the final decision will be made by the Security Council.

De Cuéllar also discussed issues related to Central America, Western Sahara, Cyprus, and the Middle East.

　　联合国秘书长纵谈地区冲突和解进程    
    欢迎我参加联合国和平行动    
    纳米比亚将成为联合国第１６０个成员国
    本报联合国２月１６日电  记者刘开宸报道：联合国秘书长佩雷斯·德奎利亚尔今天下午在这里举行的记者招待会上，纵谈和平解决地区冲突问题的进展情况。他指出，“现在我们可以期望纳米比亚将成为联合国的第１６０个成员国。”
    德奎利亚尔对今天安理会通过的授权建立“联合国过渡时期援助团”的决议表示“非常高兴”。“联合国纳米比亚计划”定于今年４月１日开始执行，１年后纳米比亚将获得独立。援助团将在这方面发挥重大作用。
    德奎利亚尔说，援助团的警察顾问史蒂文·范宁作为该团的第一位成员于明天到达纳米比亚。援助团部队的正、副司令将在下周内赴纳米比亚。
    当有记者问到中国申请参加援助团事，德奎利亚尔说，“我们欢迎中国参加联合国和平行动”。他还说，对此项要求正在考虑中。如果中国的申请被接受，那将是中国第一次参加联合国维持和平行动。
    在阿富汗问题上，德奎利亚尔说，在苏联军队全部从阿富汗撤离后，他将继续关注阿富汗国内形势，希望阿富汗取得民族和解。他指出，联合国仍有三大任务：（１）监督不干涉该地区各国的内部事务和阿富汗难民返回家园。（２）帮助阿富汗根据联合国决议建立一个广泛基础的政府。（３）帮助重建这个遭受战争破坏的国家。
    德奎利亚尔还谈到，他可能在３月份会见美国国务卿贝克时讨论阿富汗问题。
    当问及喀布尔政权要求沿边界建立永久性的观察哨事时，他说，他正在考虑中，但最后决定将由安理会作出。
    德奎利亚尔还谈了中美洲、西撒、塞浦路斯和中东等问题。
