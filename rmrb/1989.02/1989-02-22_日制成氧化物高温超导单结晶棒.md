Japan's Yamanashi University has successfully developed a single-crystal rod of an oxide high-temperature superconductor.

According to a report by the *Nihon Keizai Shimbun*, this single-crystal rod has a diameter of approximately 5 millimeters and a length of 4 centimeters. When cut, it yields plate-shaped superconducting crystals that can be used as electronic components or for studying the mechanism of superconductivity. Although single-crystal thin films have already been produced on ceramic substrates, this is the first time a rod-shaped single crystal has been created. Researchers at Yamanashi University used the floating zone method, rotating and pulling the seed crystal deposited in the solution at a speed of 1 millimeter per hour to produce the first single-crystal rod. It is said that this method can produce single-crystal rods up to 20 centimeters long.

　　日制成氧化物高温超导单结晶棒
    新华社东京２月２０日电  日本山梨大学开发成功氧化物高温超导体单结晶棒。
    据《日本经济新闻》报道，这种单结晶棒直径约５毫米，长４厘米。切断后获得板状超导结晶，可作为电子元件或用于研究超导机制。迄今在陶瓷基板上已能制作单结晶薄膜，但制成棒状还是首次。山梨大学的研究人员使用浮移法，将在溶液中沉淀的种结晶边旋转边拉伸，用每小时１毫米的速度拉制出第１根单结晶棒。据说用这种方法可以制成２０厘米长的单结晶棒。
