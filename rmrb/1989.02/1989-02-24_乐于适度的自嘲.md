How can China become richer and stronger more quickly? Facing this question, more and more descendants of the Yellow Emperor are turning their eyes and thoughts towards Chinese traditional culture. Some advocate extracting and promoting the positive elements, while others focus on critical analysis, advocating deep reflection. Of course, there are also many who hope to combine the good aspects of Chinese cultural traditions with the good aspects of both ancient and modern foreign cultures to form a new Chinese culture. In this broad cultural interest, readers who are not specialized in cultural studies have a keen interest in cultural issues but are also a bit afraid of the depth and weight of formal cultural studies monographs. Can there be books that are not too thick, not too academic, easy to read, and yet can convey some meaningful information and inspire some beneficial thoughts, making them both profound and accessible?

A broad concept of culture should include all material and spiritual products created by human society, as well as the resulting ways of life and thought. We cannot cover all aspects of Chinese culture, but we have found an entry point that readers will surely find interesting: Chinese customs and human emotions. Of course, the customs we refer to here are also a broad concept. For example, we will discuss the soft humor of the Chinese people, which goes beyond the general customs represented by festivals, rituals, and specific models, and is dissolved into the daily life of the Chinese people in a broad sense. Again, for example, we will discuss the secret aspects of historical emperors and empresses from the perspective of personal fate, which is a broad sense of human emotion analysis beyond general political, historical, ethical, and moral evaluations. We hope that in this unique observation perspective, readers can gain surprises and associations that are difficult to obtain from formal academic works. Culture is both a broad existence and a great river flowing from ancient times to the future. Therefore, the examination of culture is often a review and reflection of history. We may examine Chinese cultural customs more from the perspective of criticism and reflection, but this does not mean that we have any prior assumptions in our overall evaluation of national cultural traditions. A person with sufficient self-confidence is willing to engage in moderate self-deprecation, and a nation with sufficient self-confidence should also not fear and be willing to engage in moderate self-deprecation. We hope to have some books that, although written in a light and entertaining manner, can also reach the level of academic monographs. We also hope that some materials, although detailed, may have angles that are too abrupt and arguments that are too one-sided, can be met with a tolerant smile.

Nowadays, books in the world are as numerous as the stars in a summer night sky. There are many that are worth reading, but it seems there are even more that are not worth reading. We want to integrate scientificity and interest as much as possible, so that readers can obtain some spiritual nourishment in their leisure time. Therefore, perhaps we can make the readers who buy this book benefit from opening it. This is our sincere hope!

　　乐于适度的自嘲
    刘心武
    中国如何才能更快地富强起来？面对这个问题，越来越多的炎黄子孙把目光和思路投向了中国传统文化，有的主张从中提炼出应当大力发扬的积极因素，有的立足于分析批判，主张进行深刻的反思。当然，也有不少人希望能把中国文化传统中的好东西同外国古今的好东西结合起来，以构成一种新的中国文化。在一种广泛的文化兴趣中，并不专攻文化学的读者，对文化问题既怀有浓厚的兴趣，同时又有点害怕正规文化学专著的深奥与沉重，能不能有这样一些书，它们不太厚，不那么学究气，读起来颇为轻松有味，但却能传递出若干有意义的信息，引发出若干有教益的思考，深入浅出、雅俗共赏呢？
    宽泛的文化概念，应包括人类社会所创造的全部物质产品和精神产品，以及在此基础上所形成的生活方式及思维方式，我们无力涉及中国文化的各个方面，但我们找到了一个想来读者诸君定会感到兴趣的切入点，就是中国的风俗人情。当然，我们这里所说的风俗，也是一个宽泛的概念，比如我们将讲到中国人的软幽默，这就是超出一般以节日庆典及专有模式为表象的、溶解在中国人日常生活中的广义的风俗，再比如我们将从个人命运的角度讲到历史上帝王后妃的隐秘一面，那就是超出一般政治历史伦理道德评价的广义的人情辨析，我们希望在这种别具一格的观察取向中，使读者获得从正规学术著作中难以获得的惊奇与联想。文化既是一种广泛的存在，又是一条自远古流来并向未来流去的大河，因而对文化的考察往往也就是对历史的回顾与反思。我们也许较多地从批判与反思的角度来考察我们中国的文化风情，但这丝毫也不意味着我们在对民族文化传统的总体评价上有什么先验的前提。一个具有充分自信心的人是乐于适度自嘲的，一个具有充分自信心的民族也应当不怕并乐于适度地自嘲。我们既希望能有若干本虽然出之轻松立足趣味但亦能达到学术专著的高度，我们也希望某些材料固然翔实但角度未免过于奇突立论未免过于偏激的部分能得到掩卷一笑的宽容。
    时下世界上的书多如夏夜晴空的繁星，可读的很多，可不读的似乎更多，我们想把科学性同趣味性尽可能地水乳交融，使读者在闲暇中能比较轻松地获取一些精神上的滋补，因此或许果能使拿钱买这书的读者开卷有益。是为至盼焉！　　（注：这是本文作者为科学出版社《中国文化风情丛书》所写的序言）
