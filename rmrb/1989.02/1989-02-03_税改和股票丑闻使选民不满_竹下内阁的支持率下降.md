A national public opinion poll conducted by the Yomiuri Shimbun on January 28 and 29 revealed that the support rate for the Bunnaka Cabinet has dropped by 4.5% compared to last December, falling to 27.4%.

However, the disapproval rate for the Cabinet has risen from 50.6% in December to 55%.

According to the newspaper's analysis, the rapid decline in the Cabinet's support rate is due to its implementation of tax reforms and the involvement of a significant number of Liberal Democratic Party politicians in the "Recruit scandal," which has caused voters to express dissatisfaction and distrust towards the Bunnaka Cabinet.

　　税改和股票丑闻使选民不满
    竹下内阁的支持率下降
    新华社东京２月２日电  读卖新闻社在１月２８日和２９日两天进行的全国民意测验结果表明，竹下内阁的支持率与去年１２月相比，下降了４．５％，减至２７．４％。
    然而，对内阁的不支持率却从去年１２月的５０．６％增加到５５％。
    据这家报纸分析，竹下内阁支持率迅速下降的原因是它推行税制改革和相当数量的自民党政治家卷入了“利库路特丑闻”，从而引起了选民们对竹下内阁的不满和不信任。
