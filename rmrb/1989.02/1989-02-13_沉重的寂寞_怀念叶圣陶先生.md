It has been a year since Mr. Ye Shengtao left us. The kind and benevolent expression on the old man’s face often appears before my eyes. What I remember most is the old man’s lonely heart in his last few years.

In the winter of 1976, I began compiling the "Chronological Biography of Ye Shengtao." Among the vast amount of old newspapers and magazines, whenever I found one of the old man’s pen names or a lost article, I would joyfully go to seek his and Mrs. Zhi Shanshan’s confirmation. As long as the old man’s health was good, he would always come out to see me. Later, when he could no longer see the manuscripts clearly, he would laughingly say, “I can only sit by and listen.” He would quietly listen to us speak, sometimes interjecting a few words or asking a couple of questions. Later, even his hearing deteriorated, but he would still come out and sit by our side, laughing and saying, “I am sitting by and not listening.” I gradually understood the old man’s heart. He felt very lonely and hoped to find some relief.

Mr. Ye Shengtao’s life had always been very regular. He would get up after listening to the first broadcast of the news in the morning. During the day, he would read books, newspapers, letters, and manuscripts. He would definitely reply to letters and write articles whenever he thought of something. Besides, he would receive visitors or attend meetings. Later, when he could no longer see or hear, he often said, “The two windows to the outside world are gradually closing.” He could no longer see, hear, or write, enduring the almost complete isolation from the world. His old friends were becoming fewer and fewer, and those who were still alive found it inconvenient to move about. Most of the visitors were not very familiar to him. He would have his family members loudly convey the visitors’ words to him and strive to answer the questions they asked, feeling very tired. I was not a “proper visitor,” so the old man could “sit by and listen,” or even “sit by and not listen.” Whether he could hear or not did not matter; it was good enough to pass some time.

Mr. Ye Shengtao liked to travel. In 1978, the old man went to Sichuan to visit and study, but fell seriously ill upon returning, and his health declined ever since. He only went out once more. In May 1982, at Mrs. Zhi Shanshan’s encouragement, he went to Yantai to attend the academic conference on children’s science fiction and even gave a speech. He said that using the form of fairy tales to educate children about science was feasible and effective. He also said that since one is writing fairy tales, one must have the atmosphere of fairy tales and study how to combine fairy tale imagination with scientific knowledge to create excellent works. In the spring of 1949, Mr. Ye Shengtao and his wife entered the liberated area via Hong Kong, with Yantai being their first stop. After more than 30 years, he revisited many beautiful memories from that time, breathed in the fresh air by the sea, and saw the tremendous changes in the port, feeling very happy.

Mr. Ye Shengtao once said that he had spent the most time doing editing work, and reviewing manuscripts was his usual job, which was also the main reason for his declining eyesight. In the winter of 1984, the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China invited him to review the annotated draft of "Selected Works of Zhou Enlai on the United Front." Mr. Ye Shengtao had not reviewed manuscripts for a long time, but since it was the annotated draft of Zhou Enlai’s works, he felt it was his duty, so he put on glasses and a magnifying glass and carefully considered each word and sentence of the annotations. In the end, he also wrote down a few principles for how to annotate. Later, when the "Selected Works" was about to be published, the comrades from the United Front Work Department saw that the old man had reviewed it so carefully, so they asked him to write an afterword. The old man said his thoughts had become sluggish, and he was afraid he could not write a proper article, but agreed to fill in a poem. Before he finished the poem, the old man felt unwell and went to the Beijing Hospital for a check-up. The doctor diagnosed him with hepatitis and asked him to stay in the hospital for treatment. The old man said he had one thing left to do, so he asked the doctor for two more days to finish it before coming to the hospital. On January 10, 1985, the old man finished "Six States Song — Reading 'Selected Works of Zhou Enlai on the United Front'" and sent out the manuscript before being admitted to the Beijing Hospital. The next day, the old man fell into a coma, and the various indicators of hepatitis had deteriorated to an unmeasurable level.

Mr. Ye Shengtao was meticulous in everything. As long as he agreed to do something, he would definitely do it seriously. This was his consistent work style. In 1985, my friend Chen Zishan compiled articles by literary predecessors about Yu Dafu into "Memoirs of Yu Dafu" and asked me to respectfully request Mr. Ye Shengtao to write a title for it. The old man had long since stopped writing with a brush, as his eyes could not see clearly, and he could not write strokes as he wished. At my persistent request, the old man agreed to make an exception. He also said that "Memoirs of Yu Dafu" might mislead readers into thinking it was Yu Dafu’s own memoirs, and suggested changing the title to "Memoirs of Yu Dafu." To write the title well, he wrote seven or eight drafts, chose the most satisfactory ones, cut and pasted them, and busied himself for an entire afternoon. Seeing the old man so serious, I really felt guilty.

In the autumn of 1980, the "Longevity" magazine was founded and invited Mr. Ye Shengtao to write a title. The old man wrote "Live a few more years, do a few more things" in eight large characters. Unfortunately, his body became weaker and weaker, so he had to resign from the chairmanship of the China Democratic League for the Promotion of Progress. On June 9, 1987, the old man attended the national representative conference of the China Democratic League for the Promotion of Progress despite his illness, bidding farewell to everyone, and finally said two sentences from the "Great Learning" in the "Book of Rites": "Have it in yourself before seeking it in others, and do not have it in yourself before criticizing it in others," encouraging everyone to be strict with themselves.

I have compiled the chronological biography of Mr. Ye Shengtao and deeply know that he was a man who could not stay idle; he followed the pace of the times and wrote tens of millions of words of works and edited hundreds of books. He had always been concerned about the education and publishing industries. However, in the last few years, although his mind was still clear, his physical condition no longer allowed him to work, which was the old man’s heaviest loneliness.

### 沉重的寂寞——怀念叶圣陶先生

　　沉重的寂寞
    ——怀念叶圣陶先生
    商金林
    圣陶老人离开我们已经一年了。老人慈眉善目的神态，还常常浮现在我的眼前，最使我感念的是老人在最后几年中的寂寞心境。
    １９７６年冬，我开始编撰《叶圣陶年谱》，在浩如烟海的旧报刊上，查到老人的一个笔名或一篇佚文，总是怀着喜悦去请老人和至善同志审定。老人只要身体尚好，总出来接见我；后来他眼睛看不清文稿了，笑着说“只好列席旁听”。他静静地听我们说，有时插几句话，提一两个问题。最后连耳朵也听不清了，仍然走出来，坐到我们身边，笑着说“旁而不听了”。我渐渐地悟出了老人的心境，他感到很寂寞，希望能得到排解。
    圣陶老人生活一向很有规律，清晨听过第一遍新闻联播就起床。白天看书看报刊，看信，看稿子，信是必定要复的，想起什么就写些文章，此外就是接待来访或出门参加会议。最后眼睛看不清了，耳朵听不清了，他常常说“两扇通向外界的窗子渐渐关上了。”他不能再看，不能再听，也不能再写了，忍受着几乎与世隔绝的寂寞。老朋友是越来越少了，健在的行动也不方便了，来访的客人大多是不太熟悉的。他让家里人在耳边大声传达客人的话，努力回答客人提出的问题，感到非常劳累。我不算什么“正经客人”，老人可以“旁听”，甚至“旁而不听”，听得清听不清都没关系，也好消磨一些时光。
    圣陶老人喜欢出门旅行。１９７８年，老人去四川参观学习，回来后害了一场大病，身体就一蹶不振了，以后只出过一次门。１９８２年５月，老人在至善同志的怂恿下，到烟台去出席了科学童话学术讨论会，还在会上讲了话，他说用童话的形式对孩子进行科学教育是可以的，有效的，又说既然写童话，就要有童话的意境，要研究如何把童话的幻想和科学的知识结合起来，写出出色的作品。１９４９年春天，圣陶老人和夫人绕道香港进入解放区，第一站就是烟台。过了３０多年，他重温了当时留下的许多美好的回忆，又呼吸到了海边的新鲜空气，看到了这个港口的巨大变化，感到很欣快。
    圣陶老人自己说过，他做编辑工作的年头最长，看稿子是他经常的工作，也是他视力衰退的主要原因。１９８４年冬，中共中央统战部请他审阅《周恩来统一战线文选》的注释稿。圣陶老人已好久没有给人家看稿子了，因为是周总理的文集的注释，他感到义不容辞，于是戴上眼镜加放大镜，对注释一字一句反复斟酌，最后还对如何作注释写下了几条原则性的意见。后来《文选》就要出版了，统战部的同志见老人看得这么仔细，就请老人写一篇读后感。老人说他的思想迟钝了，正经文章怕写不好，答应填一首词。词还没有填完，老人因身体不舒适，到北京医院作检查。医生确诊为肝炎，要老人留下来住院治疗。老人说手上一件事没做完，请医生宽限两天，做完了一定来住院。１９８５年１月１０日，老人填完了《六州歌头——读〈周恩来统一战线文选〉》，把稿子送出了才住入北京医院。第二天，老人就昏迷了，肝炎的各项指数均已恶化到无法测定的高度。
    圣陶老人事无巨细，只要答应了下来，就一定认真办到，这是他一贯的工作作风。１９８５年，我的朋友陈子善汇集了文学界前辈撰写的回忆郁达夫的文章，编成了《郁达夫回忆录》，嘱我敬请圣陶老人题签。老人久已不写毛笔字了，因为眼睛看不清，横、直、撇、捺都不能从心所欲。在我的恳请下，老人同意破例。他还说“郁达夫回忆录”容易使读者误以为是郁达夫自己写的回忆录，建议把书名改为《回忆郁达夫》。为了写好这个书名，他前后写了七八幅，从中挑选比较满意的，剪贴拼凑，整整忙了一个下午。看到老人这样认真，真叫我心里过意不去。
    １９８０年秋，《长寿》杂志创刊，请圣陶老人题词，老人就写了“多活几年，多做些事”八个大字。无奈他的身体越来越衰弱，他只好辞去了中国民主促进会主席的职务。１９８７年６月９日，老人抱病参加民进全国代表会议，与大家告别，最后说了《礼记·大学》中的两句话：“有诸己而后求诸人，无诸己而后非诸人”，勉励大家要严格要求自己。
    我编过圣陶老人的年谱，深深知道他是个闲不住的人；他随着时代的步伐，写下了上千万字的作品，编了几百本书，他一直关心着教育事业和出版事业。可是在最后几年里，他的头脑虽然仍旧很清楚，身体的条件却不允许他再做工作了，这才是圣陶老人最沉重的寂寞。
