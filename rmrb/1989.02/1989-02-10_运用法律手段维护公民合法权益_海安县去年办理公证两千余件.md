Jiāngsū Province's Hǎi'ān County processed more than 2,000 notarizations last year.

New China News Agency, Shanghai, February 9th - (Reporter Lù Guóyuán) In Lìfā Township, Hǎi'ān County, 77-year-old farmer Ji Liánfāng, with the support of her four children, walked into the county's notarization office and said to the notary, Liú Zhèngyà, "Please, let the state guarantee this for me."

Ji Liánfāng requested notarization for a care agreement drafted jointly by her children.

The notarization for Ji Liánfāng and her children was the 1,991st notarization document issued by Hǎi'ān County's notarization office last year. However, six years ago, the farmers of Hǎi'ān County were completely unfamiliar with the term "notarization." People would typically ask someone to act as a guarantor when making contracts, which led to some tragedies. Farmer Wáng Zǐjiá agreed to act as a guarantor for farmer Xǔ Wénxián's pig hair factory, thinking he wouldn't be responsible for anything. However, a year later, when the factory closed, the court enforced the contract, and he, as the guarantor, had to pay 6,000 yuan in compensation.

After the Hǎi'ān County notarization office was established at the end of 1981, they paid attention to using legal means to protect people's legitimate rights. They once notarized care agreements for 61 elderly individuals in Wángduō Township with relevant village committees. A follow-up visit six months later showed that the contract fulfillment rate was as high as 95%. Legal measures increased the sense of responsibility among grassroots cadres to respect and care for the elderly. Ji Liánfāng knew her children wanted to ensure their mother had a happy old age. But she thought a contract with a guarantor would be better. Through legal education, she learned about the role of notarization and therefore came to the notarization office.

In early 1987, the tourism food factory in Xīnshēng Township signed a contract with the Bāzhōng County, Sichuan Province, Chuāndōng United Leather Processing Factory for the purchase of fresh pigskin, with a transaction amount of 300,000 yuan. During the notarization process, the county notarization office discovered that the business license of Chuāndōng United Leather Processing Factory had been revoked, and the contract was quickly terminated, preventing the tourism food factory in Xīnshēng Township from suffering a huge economic loss.

As legal education activities were carried out, more and more farmers stepped into the notarization office, seeking legal means to protect their legitimate rights. Statistics show that in 1982, the county handled a total of 55 notarizations, while last year, the number of notarizations surged to 2,044, with more than 80% of them being economic activity notarizations.

　　运用法律手段维护公民合法权益
　　海安县去年办理公证两千余件
    新华社上海２月９日电  （记者陆国元）江苏省海安县立发乡７７岁的农妇吉连芳，在４个子女的搀扶下走进县公证处，对公证员刘正亚说：“请国家给我做个保。”
    吉连芳请求公证的是一份由她的子女共同起草的赡养协议。
    为吉连芳和她的子女做的公证，是海安县公证处去年签署的第１９９１号公证书。然而在６年前，海安县农民对“公证”这个词还完全陌生，人们订立契约，习惯于请人作保，为此酿成过一些悲剧。农民王子佳慨然应允为农民许文彦承包一猪毛厂当保人，以为自己并不因此要承担什么责任，谁知一年后工厂倒闭，合同被司法部门强制执行，他作为保人，赔了６０００元。
    海安县公证处１９８１年底成立后，注意用法律手段维护人们的合法权益。他们曾为王垛乡６１名孤寡老人与有关村民委员会办理了供养协议公证。半年后进行的一次回访表明，这些供养协议的履约率高达９５％。法律手段使基层干部更增强了敬老、养老的责任心。吉连芳知道儿女们是想保障母亲过一个幸福的晚年。但她认为，协议有人做保更好。她在普法教育中懂得了公证的作用，因此来到了公证处。
    １９８７年初，新生乡的旅游食品厂与四川省巴中县川东联合制革加工厂签订了一份零块鲜肉皮的购销合同，成交额达３０万元，县公证处在为他们办理公证时，经审查发现，川东联合制革厂的营业执照已被吊销，合同很快中止，使新生乡旅游食品厂避免了巨额经济损失。
    随着普法活动的开展，有越来越多的农民跨进了公证处的大门，寻求用法律手段保护自己的合法权益。统计数字表明，１９８２年全县共办理各类公证５５件，而去年公证件数激增至２０４４件，其中，经济活动公证占了８０％以上。
