The Two Shifts in Literary Demand

I believe that the current literary scene is composed of four interdependent, intersecting, and competing literary trends: the "realistic" trend—a literary trend that can be largely categorized under the method of realistic creation; the "avant-garde" (or "experimental") trend—a literary trend that goes beyond the method of realistic creation; the "documentary" trend—including reportage literature, documentary novels, and biographical literature, marked primarily by "documentary" characteristics; and the "popular" trend—broadly referring to various literary trends that are popular among the masses, including thrillers, mysteries, romance, legends, and stories.

In the development of New Period literature, if the late 1970s and early 1980s saw the rise of the "realistic" trend, then 1985 and 1986 saw the rise of the "avant-garde" trend, and 1987 and 1988 saw the rise of the "documentary" trend.

When examining the current literary scene's four literary trends, we must also pay attention to the two shifts in reader acceptance. If we acknowledge that readers are the most authoritative judges of literature, these two shifts are: from literary value to news value, and from educational value to consumer value.

The first shift refers to the strengthening of readers' demand for the news value in literary works and the weakening of their demand for literary value. The reasons are complex, but one important reason may be the so-called "reaction to closed news." This means that insufficient or lack of news reporting increasingly stimulates readers' curiosity about news behind the scenes. Since news itself cannot satisfy this desire, reportage literature that primarily reveals these news behind the scenes partially satisfies readers' desire, thus promoting the rise of reportage literature and other non-fiction documentary literature. Of course, the rise of documentary literature has deeper reasons, that is, the numerous social problems and historical legacies that have emerged in our "transition" period society have sparked a strong desire for creation among documentary literature authors and attracted the attention and concern of a wide range of readers. Therefore, the documentary literature boom will not be a "short-term behavior" but will be a social and cultural phenomenon that will last for a considerable period.

The second shift refers to the strengthening of readers' demand for the consumer value (entertainment, leisure, venting, etc.) of literature and the weakening of their demand for educational value (education, propaganda, cognition, etc.). In the past few decades, we have overemphasized the educational function of literature, even to the extent of conducting political propaganda and moral preaching in literary works, which has caused readers' rebellious psychology. Now, this shift can also be said to be a reaction to the previous overemphasis on educational functions. The relatively relaxed, stable, and free political and cultural atmosphere has also promoted the growth of consumer demand. Some people believe that the growth of readers' demand for popular literature is a sign of the decline of national cultural quality, which is obviously lacking in sufficient basis. In fact, readers' demands are broad and multifaceted. The demand for popular literature does not exclude the demand for other types of literature. The coexistence of various literatures provides readers with multiple choices and possibilities.

I believe that the current pure literature, especially the "realistic" literature and "avant-garde" literature, is not as optimistic as "documentary" literature and "popular" literature, not entirely due to the internal reasons of pure literature, but also due to the impact of the commercial economy tide and the above-mentioned two shifts in reader acceptance. However, even so, we do not need to make overly pessimistic predictions about the future of pure literature. Pure literature, especially the "elite" literature within it, is not literature that can gain wide readership and cause a sensation at any time and under any conditions. For a long time, the value scale we used to measure the quality of literature has been greatly influenced by the following ideas: one center—with "realistic" literature in pure literature as the center; one correspondence—seeking the direct correspondence between literature and reality, that is, to what extent it closely reflects reality and provides powerful promotion; one sensation—what kind of and how much sensation literature causes in society and among the public. This easily leads to the exclusion of the literary pluralistic pattern; the devaluation of literature that has a certain distance from reality or does not seek urgent correspondence with reality; and the neglect of literature that has not caused a sensation in society and among the public for the time being.

The Three Basic Directions of Literary Creation

If we can realistically and calmly examine the current literary scene, especially pure literary creation, then I believe that the basic creative directions of the following three types of writers are particularly worthy of attention.

First, a group of middle-aged and young writers who have come from the 1950s or have become famous in the New Period and are still literary warriors, such as Wang Meng, Lu Wenfu, Gao Xiaosheng, Feng Jici, Li Guowen, Lin Jinduan, Liu Xinhua, Zhang Jie, Chen Rong, etc. They still closely follow reality. The art they advocate is basically for life, and proposals like "art for art's sake" and "playing with literature" are incompatible with their creative practice. However, they generally adopt a tolerant attitude towards these proposals. They have not abandoned the mission of literature to elevate people's spiritual realm and forge people's souls, but they no longer want to preach morality and political indoctrination to readers in their works. From their works, we can still clearly hear the voice of the times, a strong or weak reflection of the spirit of the times, but this spirit of the times has become more internal and deep-seated, rather than external and superficial. From seeking the direct correspondence between literature and reality to exploring the active correspondence between literature and reality, their works have all undergone profound changes in artistic expression methods and overall appearance.

Second, after a group of young writers such as Mo Yan, Ma Yuan, Chen Rong, Liu Suola, and Xu Xing emerged around 1985, in the past two or three years, another group of young writers such as Hong Feng, Su Tong, Ge Fei, Yu Hua, and Sun Ganlu have emerged. Compared with the older generation of writers and the aforementioned middle-aged and young writers represented by Wang Meng, there are significant differences in value orientation and artistic orientation. They are the representatives of contemporary China's "avant-garde" artistic trend. Like our "transition" period society today, these writers' artistic explorations also show the characteristics of the "transition" period: full of creativity, but also full of superficiality. Their greatest contribution to contemporary Chinese literature may be to turn the novel, which is basically a reflective art, into an expressive art. Although the avant-garde experimental novels they create are facing difficulties, and even their former supporters have expressed disappointment, they are still surviving and developing. They still have a group of readers, and they are still favored by some prestigious publications and supported by some critics, and there are constantly some readable and enduring works emerging. Therefore, saying that these novels are facing difficulties seems acceptable, but saying that they have declined seems groundless. These avant-garde experimental novels themselves are also changing: from discarding the plot framework of the novel in various ways to skillfully creating the plot of the novel. This may help to expand the readership of these novels and help them get out of the difficulties they face.

Third, comparable in age to the aforementioned avant-garde writers, in recent years, a group of young "realistic" novelists have emerged, such as Zhu Xiaoping, Li Rui, Li Xiao, Liu Heng, Fang Fang, Chi Li, Yang Yongming, Zhou Daxin, etc. The appearance of their works has made the realistic novel, which seemed somewhat dim due to the impact of new wave works, revive again, and it shows some new characteristics compared to traditional realistic novels. These characteristics can be roughly described as follows: first, paying attention to the living conditions of ordinary people, not avoiding the contradictions and defects of reality, being dissatisfied with the existing order, showing a spirit of seeking truth, a spirit of facing a bleak life and confronting bloodshed, and a profound humanitarian spirit; second, from writing about heroes to writing about ordinary people, from creating typical characters to the fading of typical characters, from writing about the external world to writing about the internal world; third, the openness and compatibility of artistic concepts and expression methods, that is, not adopting a closed and exclusionary attitude towards expression methods other than realism, but being bold in borrowing and absorbing. Such literature, whether from its ideological content and artistic orientation, is both suitable for China's national conditions and suitable for the reading tastes of most contemporary Chinese readers, so its prospects are optimistic.

Low Valley or Transition?

In summary, I believe that although the current literary scene is not inspiring, there seems to be no reason to be pessimistic. If we are not infatuated with the old literary pattern and satisfied with chasing the surface sensation of literature, then the current literary scene may not be said to be abnormal. Saying that the literary scene is in a "low valley" period seems not to reveal its essence. Saying that it is in a "transition" period may be more accurate. The characteristics of the "transition" period literary scene, to borrow a ready-made phrase, are that everything has started anew, and everything is being rearranged. Literature has changed from a single and closed pattern to the current pluralistic and open pattern, with the main characteristic being the coexistence, interpenetration, and formation of a complex, changing, chaotic, and disorderly state of various literary trends. We will not be satisfied and content with this state, but we should not turn around and yearn for the old state. Lu Xun said, "To promote the birth of the new, we must vigorously strike down the old that is harmful to the new..." I think this should also be our—everyone who supports the reform cause (including literary reform)—indispensable responsibility!

　　“转型期”创作琐谈
    陈骏涛
    文学需求的两个转移
    我认为，当今的文坛是由这样四股相互依存、彼此交叉又竞相抗衡的潮流所组成的：“写实”潮流——一种基本上可以纳入现实主义创作方法的文学潮流；“先锋”（或曰“探索”、“实验”）潮流——一种逸出现实主义创作方法之外的文学潮流；“纪实”潮流——以“纪实”为主要标志和优势的包括报告文学、纪实小说、传记文学潮流；“通俗”潮流——泛指流行于民间的包括惊险、推理、言情、传奇、故事等文学潮流。在新时期文学的发展历程中，如果说在７０年代末和８０年代初是“写实”潮流走前的话，那么到了１９８５年和１９８６年则是“先锋”潮流走前，而到了１９８７年和１９８８年又是“纪实”潮流走前。
    在考察当今文坛如上四股文学潮流的时候，不能不同时注意到读者接受需求的两个转移，如果我们承认读者是文学的最有权威的裁判者的话。这两个转移是：从文学性向新闻性的转移；从教化性向消费性的转移。
    第一个转移是指读者对文学作品中的新闻性需求的强化和对文学性需求的弱化。这个原因很复杂，其中的一个重要原因可能是所谓“封闭新闻的反效应”。这就是说新闻报道不足或不予报道愈益激发读者对这些新闻内幕窥视的兴趣。既然新闻本身无法满足读者的这种欲望，那么以揭示这些新闻内幕为主要优势的报告文学作品就部分地满足了读者的这种欲望，这就促进了报告文学和其他非虚构型纪实文学的勃兴。当然，纪实文学的勃兴还有更深刻的原因，那就是我们这个“转型”期社会所出现的大量社会问题和历史遗留问题激发起纪实文学作者强烈的创作欲望，并吸引着广大读者的关心和注意。因此，纪实文学热不会是一种“短期行为”，而是会持续相当长时间的一种社会现象和文化现象。
    第二个转移是指读者对文学的消费性需求（娱乐、消遣、宣泄等）的强化和教化性需求（教育、宣传、认识等）的弱化。过去几十年我们过于强化文学的教化功能，甚至导致在文学作品中进行政治宣传和道德说教，引起了读者的逆反心理，现在的这种转移，也可以说是对以往的强化教化功能的反效应，而相对宽松、稳定、自由的政治气氛和文化气氛也促进了这种消费性需求的增长。有人认为读者对通俗文学需求的增长是民族文化素质降低的表现，这个估计显然是缺乏足够的根据的；实际上，读者的需求是广泛的和多方面的，对通俗文学的需求并不排斥对其他各种文学的需求，各种文学的同时并存提供给读者以多种选择的机会和可能。
    我认为，当今纯文学中的“写实”文学和“先锋”文学之所以比起“纪实”文学和“通俗”文学来难以令人乐观，不完全是纯文学自身的原因，还有商品经济大潮的冲击以及上述读者接受需求两大转移等外在的原因。但是，即便如此，我们也不必对纯文学的前景作过于悲观的估计。纯文学特别是其中的“精英文学”，本来就不是在任何时间和任何条件下都能获得广大读者和引起轰动效应的文学。长期以来，我们衡量文学优劣的价值尺度很大程度上是受到下述观念所左右的：一个中心——以纯文学中的“写实”文学为中心；一种对应——寻求文学与现实的直接的对应，即它在何种程度上密切地反映了现实并给予有力的促进；一种轰动——文学在社会上、在公众中引起了什么样的以及多大的轰动效应。这样，就易于造成了对文学的多元格局的排斥；造成了对与现实有一定距离，或者并不寻求与现实迫切对应的文学的贬抑；造成了对在社会上和公众中暂时未引起轰动效应的文学的轻视。
    　　　　文学创作的三种基本走向
    如果我们能实事求是、冷静客观地来看待当今的文坛、特别是纯文学创作的话，那么我认为如下三类作家的基本创作走向是值得特别予以关注的。
    第一，从５０年代走过来的或基本上是新时期成名的至今仍然是文坛骁将的一批中壮年作家，如王蒙、陆文夫、高晓声、冯骥才、李国文、林斤澜、刘心武、张洁、谌容等等，他们仍然密切关注着现实，他们所遵奉的基本上是为人生的艺术，“为艺术而艺术”和“玩文学”之类的主张与他们的创作实践是格格不入的，不过他们对这类主张大都采取宽容的态度。他们没有抛却以提高人的精神境界、铸造人的灵魂为宗旨的文学的使命意识，不过再也不愿在作品中对读者进行道德说教和政治灌输了。从他们的作品中我们依然可以清晰地谛听到时代的声音，一种或强或弱的时代精神的折光，但这种时代精神已经越来越成为内在的和深潜的，而不是外在的和浅露的了。从追寻文学与现实的直接的对应到探索文学与现实的能动的对应，使他们的作品无一例外地在艺术表现方法和整体风貌上同样也发生了深刻的变化。
    第二，在１９８５年前后出现了一批诸如莫言、马原、残雪、刘索拉、徐星等年轻作家之后，近两三年又出现了诸如洪峰、苏童、格非、余华、孙甘露等一批年轻作家。与老一辈作家相比，与上述以王蒙为代表的中壮年作家相比，在价值取向和艺术取向上都存在着极大的区别，他们是当代中国“先锋”艺术倾向的代表。跟当今我们这个“转型期”社会的特点一样，这些作家的艺术探索也表现出“转型期”的特点：充满着创造，也充满着浮躁。他们对中国当代文学的最大贡献可能是在于把小说这个基本上是反映的艺术变成了表现的艺术。他们所创作的先锋实验小说尽管面临着困境，甚至连昔日的支持者也对之表示失望，但它们仍在生存着、发展着。它们依然拥有一批读者，而且依然受到一些有威望的刊物的青睐和一些批评家的支持，也不断有一些可读、耐读的作品出世。因此，说这些小说面临困境似无不可，但要说它们已经走向衰落似无根据。这些先锋实验小说自身也处于变化之中：从变着法儿丢掉小说故事情节的框架到变着法儿巧妙地营造小说的故事情节。这可能有利于扩大这些小说的读者层，帮助它们摆脱面临的困境。
    第三，跟上述的先锋作家年龄相当，近几年崛起了一批年轻的“写实”小说家，例如朱晓平、李锐、李晓、刘恒、方方、池莉、杨咏鸣、周大新等等。他们作品的出现使得因为新潮作品的冲击而显得略为暗淡的写实小说重又得以复兴，而且表现出与传统的写实小说的某些新的特点。这些特点概略地说有：其一，重视表现普通人的生存境况，不避讳现实的矛盾和缺陷，对现存秩序不满足，表现出一种求真的意识，一种直面惨淡的人生、正视淋漓的鲜血的精神，一种深邃的人道主义精神；其二，从写英雄到写普通人，从创造典型到典型的淡化，从写外世界到写内世界；其三，艺术观念和表现手法的开放性和相容性，这就是说对写实主义之外其他各种表现方法并不采取封闭的和排斥的态度，而是勇于借鉴、勇于吸收的。这样的文学不管是从其思想内涵和艺术取向上看，都是既适合中国的国情，也适合中国当代多数读者的阅读口味的，因而其前景是可以乐观的。
    　　　　低谷还是转型？
    总之，我以为，尽管当今文坛的状况并不令人振奋，但似乎也没有理由悲观。如果我们不是迷恋于旧的文学格局，满足于去追逐文学的表面的轰动效应的话，那么如今文坛的状况也许还不能说是不正常的。说文坛处于“低谷”期，似乎并不能透视其本质，要说它正处于“转型”期，也许更为确切。“转型”期文坛的特点，套用一句现成的话来说，就是一切都重新开了个头，一切都在重新安排之中。文学从单一和封闭的格局，而到如今的多元和开放的格局，其主要的特点就是多种文学潮流并存、互渗，形成了一种错综繁杂、变动不居、紊乱无序的状态。我们当然不会满意和满足于这种状态，但也不必因此转而怀恋旧的状态。鲁迅说，“要催促新的产生，对于有害于新的旧物，则竭力加以排击……”我想，这也应该是我们——一切赞成改革事业（包括文学改革）的人的无可推卸的责任！
