Now, we should focus on improving the quality of art, which is also the fundamental purpose of art reform, to better serve the people. Vice Minister of Culture Ying Ruocheng recently emphasized this point in an interview with reporters.

This cultural official candidly said that for many years, the issue of popularizing and elevating culture has not been well addressed. For a long time, due to the backwardness of old China, cultural popularization was emphasized. Later, under the influence of "leftist" ideology, emphasizing the improvement of artistic quality was often criticized as deviating from the direction of art. Before the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, one of the consequences of long-term closure was that we, in the field of art, closed ourselves off and called ourselves "emperor," without comparison and unaware of the top-tier art in the world. In recent years, the party's open policy in the field of art has significantly improved the performance quality of art troupes. However, there is still a view that Chinese audiences have low appreciation levels and that high-quality art is like "the sound of jade stones striking together" (a metaphor for high-class art), lamenting that audiences prefer to watch vulgar and inferior things. He believes these views do not reflect the reality. He said, China is poor, and it is a fact that the cultural level of the masses is not high, but the audience has a desire for high-quality art. The Beijing People's Art Theatre's "The First Rank Under Heaven" has been performed over 100 times, which shows that the people are calling for the appearance of high-quality art.

Ying Ruocheng believes that objective artistic quality is not a subjective and arbitrary standard. The most inspiring achievement of the Beijing People's Art Theatre's reform is that the fundamental purpose of art reform is to improve artistic quality and better serve the people.

This vice minister believes that some artistic benchmarks should be established. If high-quality art appears in art troupes in society, the state should also reward them heavily, commend them, and arrange for them to participate in art festivals and go abroad to perform.

　　英若诚谈文艺改革根本目的时指出
　　应注重艺术质量的提高
　　群众文化水平不高但渴求高质量艺术
    新华社北京２月７日电  （记者张宝瑞、王岳龙）现在应该注重艺术质量的提高，这也是文艺改革的根本目的，以此更好地为人民群众服务。文化部副部长英若诚近日在接受记者采访时这样强调。
    这位文化官员坦诚地说，多年来文艺普及和提高的问题一直没有得到很好解决。长期以来由于旧中国比较落后，因此比较强调文化普及。后来在“左”的思想影响下，强调提高艺术质量，往往被指责为偏离了文艺方向。党的十一届三中全会以前，长期封闭的恶果之一，就是我们在文艺上关门自称“皇帝”，没有比较，看不到世界上的一流艺术。近年来党在文艺上的开放政策，使文艺团体的演出质量有了很大提高。但是还有这样的看法，认为中国观众素质差，欣赏水平低，悲叹高质量的艺术是阳春白雪，指责观众喜欢看粗俗低劣的东西。他认为这些不符合实际。他说，中国穷，群众文化水平不高是事实，但观众有对高质量艺术的渴求。北京人艺的《天下第一楼》目前演了１００多场，这说明人民群众在呼唤高质量的艺术出现。
    英若诚认为，客观的艺术质量，不是主观随意的标准。北京人艺的改革成果中，给人以最大启发的是文艺改革的根本目的在于提高艺术质量，更好地服务于人民。
    这位副部长认为要树立一些文艺标杆，如果社会上办的文艺团体出现了高质量的艺术，国家也应当给予重奖，也应该表彰，同时让他们参加艺术节并安排出国演出。
