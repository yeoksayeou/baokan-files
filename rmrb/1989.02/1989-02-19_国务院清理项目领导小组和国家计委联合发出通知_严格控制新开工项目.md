The State Council Project Cleanup Group and the State Planning Commission recently jointly issued a notice, approved by the State Council, requiring strict control over new construction projects this year.

The _Notice_ stipulates that, except for a few necessary new construction projects in agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, education, fertilizers, export earnings, and foreign-related projects that have already signed contracts, as well as housing projects that are to be approved according to regulations, all other projects (regardless of whether they are large, medium-sized, or above the quota, small, or below the quota, various ownerships, and various sources of funds) are not allowed to start construction before July 31 this year. Whether construction can start in August will depend on the economic situation and the reduction of fixed asset investment scale.

The _Notice_ emphasizes that those who violate regulations and start construction without authorization will be severely punished; for such projects, banks will not disburse funds, material departments will not supply construction materials, power departments will not supply construction electricity, construction teams will not be allowed to work, and the project's self-raised funds will be confiscated and turned over to the same-level finance department, with other investment channels frozen pending disposal.

The _Notice_ states that for projects using foreign investment and direct foreign investment, if they meet the industrial policy requirements, have formally signed contracts with foreign parties, and have paid the registered capital as required, and the Chinese side's investment in joint venture projects has been realized and included in the national plan "cage," they can be approved for new construction according to regulations.

To appropriately concentrate the approval power for new construction projects, the _Notice_ stipulates:

- Large, medium-sized, and above-quota projects will still be uniformly reviewed by the State Planning Commission and reported to the State Council for approval, and departments (companies) and local governments are not allowed to approve them on their own.
- Small and below-quota projects are divided into the following categories:
	1. Newly constructed local projects with a total investment of 100 million yuan or more (including 100 million yuan) must be reported to the provincial people's government for approval; those below 100 million yuan will be approved by the provincial planning commission (economic commission) or provincial-level units authorized by the provincial people's government; those not approved by the provincial planning commission (economic commission) must be filed with the provincial planning commission (economic commission).
	2. Newly constructed central projects will be approved by the project's supervising department (company).
	3. The approval power for newly constructed projects in separately planned cities will be determined by the provincial people's government.
	4. Newly constructed central and local projects with a total investment of 1,000 million yuan or more (including 1,000 million yuan) must be filed with the State Planning Commission.

The _Notice_ states that the above measures will be implemented during the two-year period of rectification and adjustment.

　　国务院清理项目领导小组和国家计委联合发出通知    
    严格控制新开工项目
    本报讯  记者鲁牧报道：经国务院批准，国务院清理固定资产投资项目领导小组和国家计委最近联合发出通知，要求今年新开工项目必须严格控制。
    《通知》规定，各部门（公司）和各地区除若干必需新开工的农业、林业、水利、教育、化肥、出口创汇、已签合同的涉外项目和住宅项目按规定报批外，所有项目（不论大中型和限额以上、小型和限额以下、各种所有制和各种资金来源）在今年７月底前一律不得新开工。８月以后是否新开工，将视经济形势和压缩固定资产投资规模的情况再定。
    《通知》强调，违反规定擅自开工的，将对批准者和建设单位负责人严惩不贷；对该项目，银行不拨资金，物资部门不供建设物资，电力部门不供建设用电，施工队不得施工，还要没收项目自筹资金，上缴同级财政，冻结其它投资渠道的资金，听候处理。
    《通知》说，关于利用外资和外商直接投资的项目，若符合产业政策要求、对外已正式签订合同、并已按规定交纳注册资本、合资项目中中方投资已落实且纳入国家下达计划“笼子”的，可以按规定批准新开工。
    为适当集中项目新开工审批权，《通知》规定：
    ——大中型和限额以上项目仍由国家计委统一审核后报国务院批准，部门（公司）和地方政府不得自行批准。
    ——小型和限额以下项目分以下几类：
    １、总投资在１００万元以上（含１００万元）的新开工地方项目，一律报省级人民政府审批；１００万元以下的由省级计委（计经委）或省级人民政府授权的省级单位审批；非省级计委（计经委）批准的，应报省级计委（计经委）备案。
    ２、中央新开工项目由项目主管部门（公司）审批。
    ３、计划单列市新开工审批权由省级人民政府确定。
    ４、总投资在１０００万元以上（含１０００万元）的中央和地方新开工项目，要报国家计委备案。
    《通知》说，以上办法限于今明两年治理整顿期间适用。
