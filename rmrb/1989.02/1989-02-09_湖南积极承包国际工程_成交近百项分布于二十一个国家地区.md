　　湖南积极承包国际工程
　　成交近百项分布于二十一个国家地区
    新华社长沙２月８日电  （记者张勇）湖南省积极参与国际工程承包和劳务技术合作。从１９８４年以来这个省已对外成交项目９８项，这些项目分布在北美、欧洲、非洲和亚洲的２１个国家和地区。
    据湖南国际经济技术合作公司总经理石砚光介绍，去年，湖南签订的国际工程承包和劳务技术合作业务的合同金额达５５４万美元。通过劳务承包，带动了各种设备、材料的出口，并支持了民航、远洋运输、银行、保险等业务的发展，收到良好的社会效益。
    湖南已实施的对外承包工程包括一些国家的议会大厦、大使馆、航空公司办公楼、高级宾馆、加油站、住宅和农田水利设施、小水电和沼气工程等。近５年来，承包项目由小到大，目前已向设计施工总承包发展。在对外劳务合作和技术服务方面，也已由单一的普通劳务、传统技艺向高层次多行业的技术劳务发展。现在，联邦德国的１１个州中，已有７个州、２４个城市的３０多家餐馆聘有湖南派出的湘菜厨师，厨师劳务已辐射到卢森堡、西班牙、丹麦等国。
    目前，湖南国际经济技术合作公司已在海外兴办了８个合资或独资企业，经营餐馆、农场、贸易、咖啡加工、大理石开采和工程承包等业务。
