President George Bush and his wife Barbara Bush hosted a banquet at the Great Wall Hotel this evening.

State Chairman Yang Shangkun and Premier Li Peng were invited to attend the banquet.

Bush said in his toast that over the past two days, he had discussed the future of U.S.-China relations with Chinese leaders and exchanged views on Cambodia, Afghanistan, Korea, and the Middle East, regions that still have problems in the world.

He said, "After these discussions, I am deeply convinced that U.S.-China relations are solid. The United States hopes to cooperate with China to make the present and future generations live in a more secure, more peaceful, and more prosperous world."

Yang Shangkun said in his toast that although President Bush's visit to China was brief, it was very successful. He said, "Your visit has further enhanced mutual understanding between the two sides and added a new chapter to the friendship between the peoples of China and the United States."

Yang Shangkun said that both sides believe that the economic relations between the two countries have great potential and broad prospects, and are willing to strengthen cooperation and exchanges, and expand the economic foundation of the two countries' relations. Both sides have expressed their commitment to adhere to the three joint communiqués between China and the United States, and to properly handle difficulties and problems in the relations between the two countries. He said, "Although we have different views on some issues, and there are some issues in the relations between the two countries that need to be handled seriously and carefully, there is reason to believe that as long as both sides make joint efforts, U.S.-China relations can achieve new and greater development in the last decade of this century."

Li Peng's wife, Zhu Lin, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Rong Yiren, Fei Xiaotong, Vice Premiers Tian Jiyun, and Wu Xueqian were also invited to attend the banquet.

    国家主席杨尚昆和国务院总理李鹏应邀出席了宴会。
    布什在祝酒时说，在过去两天里，他同中国领导人讨论了美中关系的未来，并对柬埔寨、阿富汗、朝鲜和中东这些世界上仍有麻烦的地区交换了看法。
    他说，经过这些讨论之后，他深信美中关系是牢固的。美国希望和中国合作，使现在和未来的几代人生活在更加安全，更加和平和更加繁荣的世界上。
    杨尚昆在祝酒时说，布什总统这次访华虽然短暂，却非常成功。他说，“你的这次访问进一步增进了双方的相互了解，谱写了中美两国人民友谊的新篇章”。
