The *Selected Works of Li Xiannian* that we now present to our readers is not very lengthy, but it fundamentally reflects the author's half-century-long revolutionary career, which was both arduous and glorious.

As readers can clearly see from the *Selected Works*, Li Xiannian, like many other older-generation proletarian revolutionaries, dedicated his entire life to the cause of the Party, the state, and the people. In terms of work nature, his revolutionary experience can be divided into three periods.

Li Xiannian joined the revolution in 1926 and until just before national liberation, he mainly engaged in armed struggle. He participated in the famous Long March of the Red Army. In the struggle of the Western Route Army, he wrote a tragic chapter in the battle history of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army. In the early stages of the Anti-Japanese War, he led several dozen cadres from Yan'an to the enemy-rear areas of southern Henan and northern Hubei to establish anti-Japanese armed forces and open up base areas. Under extremely complex conditions and arduous struggles, he employed the strategic and tactical principles of guerrilla warfare as indicated by Comrade Mao Zedong, and the policies and strategies of the Anti-Japanese United Front. He mobilized and relied on anti-Japanese masses from all strata, adopted flexible and mobile combat methods, and resolutely fought against the Japanese invaders and puppet forces. At the same time, he conducted reasonable, beneficial, and moderate struggles against the anti-communist diehards of the Kuomintang. In less than seven years, he established a strategically significant base area in the border region of Hubei and Henan, covering thousands of miles around Wuhan, with over 50,000 main force troops and 300,000 militiamen. From the *Selected Works*, one can sense that during this period, Li Xiannian was already capable of independently opening up work and commanding large-scale operations in complex environments, leading the masses of the people in a broad area to struggle, and becoming a relatively mature proletarian revolutionary.

From 1949 to 1954, Li Xiannian presided over the Party and government work in Hubei Province and participated in the leadership of the Central-South Bureau. Facing new revolutionary tasks, the author systematically investigated local conditions and effectively completed various tasks set by the Party Central Committee, thereby establishing local people's democratic dictatorship, and restoring and developing economic, cultural, and educational undertakings. He particularly focused on agricultural production and construction, especially the construction of water conservancy projects, laying a solid foundation for Hubei to become an important agricultural production base in the country. Like many older-generation proletarian revolutionaries, after the victory of the revolution, he followed Comrade Mao Zedong's teachings, did not become arrogant or complacent, and did not stagnate. Instead, he diligently learned many things he did not understand. At the same time, in the early days of the founding of the nation, when everything was in ruins and tasks were extremely heavy, he could focus on key work and also carry out other aspects of work around the key work. As the "captain" of a provincial leadership team, he led and united all team members to work vigorously in all areas. During this period, Li Xiannian had already become a relatively outstanding leader in mastering the overall situation of a region.

In 1954, Li Xiannian was transferred to the central government to mainly lead the work of the departments of finance, banking, commerce, foreign trade, and prices. During the Cultural Revolution, after being "sidelined" for a period, he successively assisted Comrades Zhou Enlai and Deng Xiaoping in handling economic affairs, making efforts to stabilize the national economy and people's livelihood to the best of his ability. After being elected as an important leader of the Party at the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, he continued to manage the economy with Comrade Chen Yun. Everyone knows that financial and commercial work is more complex than specialized departments and more specific than comprehensive departments. If the major proportional relationships of the national economy are out of balance, they will first be reflected in finance, credit, market, and prices; while the adjustment and coordination of proportional relationships must start from balancing the income and expenditure of finance and credit, and stabilizing market prices. Li Xiannian quickly and effectively grasped the situation and laws in this area, playing an active role in ensuring the stable development of the national economy. In the *Selected Works*, the writings of this period account for about two-thirds of the book, and this part is the richest and most vivid part of the book.

Over a long period, Li Xiannian consistently advocated the principles of no budget deficit in finance, strict control over currency issuance, and the balance of foreign exchange income and expenditure, maintaining stable market prices. He believed that basic construction must be done within one's capabilities, and the improvement of people's livelihood must be in line with the development of production, and one should not do what one cannot do. To ensure the continuous and stable development of the national economy, he insisted that the national economic plan must undergo comprehensive balancing, mainly the balancing of finance, credit, materials, and foreign exchange, and also consider the connection between years to avoid large fluctuations. Li Xiannian believed that planned and proportional development is a law that socialist economies must follow and cannot be violated under any circumstances. He actively advocated the development of commodity economy and the use of the law of value, insisting on reform, opening up, and revitalizing the economy. At the same time, he believed that the development of the commodity economy should generally be the development of a planned commodity economy based on public ownership. Under the conditions of reform, opening up, and revitalizing the economy, it is even more necessary to strengthen macro-control, including the speed of production, the scale of construction, industrial structure, consumption level, as well as finance, credit, market, and prices, etc. For this, decentralization should be appropriate to avoid various out-of-control phenomena. He also firmly advocated that while strengthening the construction of material civilization, one must also strengthen the construction of spiritual civilization, which requires unswervingly carrying out ideological and political work and not weakening the leadership of the Party.

Li Xiannian believed that in socialist economic construction, the principle of planned and proportional development must not be abandoned. The development of the commodity economy must also be planned and proportional. Common sense tells us that capitalist commodity economies also require proportionality, and if the proportions are out of balance, a crisis will occur, and serious imbalances will lead to serious crises. Since the early 1930s global economic crisis, many government leaders and economists of capitalist countries have been seeking ways to avoid crises, and the most important one is to strengthen macro-control and adjustment measures. They mainly use taxation, credit, and budget allocation for adjustment, and some also use legal regulations and administrative measures. We are a socialist country, and we have more conditions and need to do this, and we cannot regard the plan as an obstacle to the development of productive forces. As for the drawbacks of the past planning system and the shortcomings in planning work, such as over-centralization and over-rigid control, they should of course be reformed and corrected. Soon after the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, Comrade Chen Yun proposed that economic activities should not only have plans but also have market regulation. In the works included in the *Selected Works*, Li Xiannian also discussed the relationship between plans and markets many times. Experience has proven that with a unified plan that conforms to reality and can be macroscopically controlled, and a market regulation that can enhance the vitality of the economy, the prosperity and development of our economic construction can be basically guaranteed.

Looking at the content of the three periods in the *Selected Works*, it can be seen that Li Xiannian, through long-term revolutionary and construction practices, has rich experience and can therefore comprehensively and deeply grasp Mao Zedong Thought, making outstanding contributions to the people's cause and continuing to do so. This is the fundamental reason why Li Xiannian, as well as all older-generation proletarian revolutionaries, are respected by the entire Party and the people of the whole country. Their strong Party spirit, dedication, and good work style are all worthy of our broad Party members and cadres to learn from. This is especially important for relatively young responsible cadres at various levels of leadership. Passing on the excellent traditions that our Party has won with the blood of countless martyrs from generation to generation, maintaining and enhancing the Party's political prestige among the broad masses of the people, is an important guarantee for the success of China's socialist modernization construction.

Li Xiannian has several outstanding features in learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought, which we deeply felt during the editing of his manuscripts and which have greatly educated us in our thinking.

First, Li Xiannian firmly executed the Party's correct decisions and instructions, truly implementing them from beginning to end without wavering. However, in his execution, he did not mechanically copy and paste but always tried to combine them with the actual situation of the region or aspect he led, first conducting investigations and research, understanding the situation, and then proceeding from reality to work. In other words, he strictly adhered to the principle of seeking truth from facts in any work. The success in creating the anti-Japanese base area in the border region of Hubei and Henan in the 1940s was mainly because he was very familiar with the situation of the enemy, friends, and ourselves at that time, as well as the revolutionary potential of the local people, local customs, and geographical conditions. He could proceed from reality and creatively implement the Party's various policies and guidelines. In the 1950s, when he presided over the work in Hubei, it was the same. Soon after arriving in Wuhan, in November 1949, he gave a report titled "The Characteristics of Hubei and Current Policies," providing a specific analysis of the economic and social situation of Hubei. At that time, he, based on the actual situation that the feudal foundation in rural areas remained unchanged and the dependence of urban industry on agriculture, implemented the policy of focusing on rural areas while considering urban areas, achieving remarkable results. After going to the central government, he led the financial and commercial work, also proceeding from reality to implement the central government's decisions. He always used the true data he grasped in finance, credit, commerce, grain, and other aspects as the basis, timely proposing methods to implement the central government's policies, and timely reporting to the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, including suggestions and opinions for overcoming certain deviations and errors in decision-making. This method of proceeding from reality to work is completely in line with the spirit of Mao Zedong Thought. Seeking truth from facts is the essence of Mao Zedong Thought and a principle that must be strictly adhered to in all work.

Proceeding from reality and creatively carrying out work is easy to say but difficult to do. In various works, leaders generally want to seek truth from facts, but due to various reasons, such as incomplete grasp of the situation, biased thinking methods, and even personal gains and losses, the results often do not meet expectations. There are many historical experiences and lessons on this issue. The key is whether one can always maintain a humble and prudent attitude, always humbly understand the situation, and adhere to the principle of putting people's interests and truth first. From an overall perspective, our Party is a politically mature and organized Party with discipline, and the Party's leadership is collective leadership under the democratic centralism system. Under the correct line and policies, and normal intra-Party political life, as long as one is humble and prudent, one can generally proceed from reality to work. The problem is that in special situations where intra-Party political life is not very normal, adhering to seeking truth from facts becomes much more difficult. In the mid-1950s, when the atmosphere of opposing rightist conservatism prevailed, Li Xiannian timely proposed to prevent rash advancement. During the later "Great Leap Forward," he and the financial and commercial departments under his leadership also had a period of feverishness, but by the first half of 1959, he had become relatively sober about the problems and quickly "applied the brakes." During the Lu Shan Conference, in his report to the Central Committee, he clearly pointed out the problems and their seriousness, and proposed economic adjustment opinions (see the article "Current Problems and Adjustment Measures in Finance and Finance"). This report was later criticized, but his views did not actually change. During the three years of economic difficulties, he actively participated in the leadership of economic adjustment. In the spring of 1962, with the support of Comrade Liu Shaoqi, he presided over the drafting of the famous two decisions on strictly controlling currency issuance and strictly controlling financial management, which played a good role in reversing the difficult situation at that time. Similar situations also include the second adjustment of the national economy in the spring of 1979, where he firmly advocated implementing the second "eight-character policy" with adjustment as the center and made a detailed report. In this report, he seriously summarized the experience of China's economic construction, which can be summed up in one sentence: the national economy should develop steadily and continuously, and there should be no more ups and downs. All these are invaluable.

From the above facts, it can be seen that seeking truth from facts and adhering to the truth are actually the same thing. To seek truth from facts is to adhere to the truth; only by daring to adhere to the truth can one seek truth from facts and not be disturbed by various negative factors.

Second, Li Xiannian was good at uniting cadres in his work, making everyone feel comfortable and fully utilizing their wisdom and creativity. During the editing of the book, we heard from many comrades who had worked under his leadership that during his work in Hubei or at the central government, during multiple political movements, the regions and departments he led tried to avoid exaggeration and hurt few people, and everyone praised him for his heartfelt care for cadres. As for usual times, he would listen to various opinions before making decisions, concentrating everyone's wisdom. For different opinions, he could also listen and make his considerations more thorough. If he found that a cadre had made mistakes in work or had problems in work style, he would frankly criticize, sometimes even severely. But he always did so with the intention of unity, being good to people, and historically and comprehensively viewing the strengths and weaknesses, merits and demerits of cadres, never arbitrarily persecuting people, and never promoting sycophants. Therefore, working under his leadership, there was a sense of trust and security, and with this, comrades with Party spirit could fully exert their initiative and do their best for the people's cause.

From the *Selected Works*, it can be seen that in different periods, Li Xiannian was also good at uniting a large number of non-Party cadres, democratic personages from various parties, and progressive elements. He particularly valued uniting intellectuals. As early as when he was creating the anti-Japanese base area in the border region of Hubei and Henan, he used every means to expand the anti-Japanese united front, winning over and uniting all masses with anti-Japanese demands, all patriotic personages, including landlords and gentry, effectively implementing the Party's strategy of developing progressive forces, winning over intermediate forces, and isolating diehard forces. He highly respected people with knowledge who gathered in the base area from various aspects, paying attention to strengthening the unity between workers and peasants cadres and intellectuals, and thus cultivating a large number of cadres in the process of developing the base area. During his work in Hubei, in 1950, Li Xiannian wrote a good article, included in the *Selected Works*, titled "Strengthening the Work of the United Front." In the article, he required Party organs and leading cadres to overcome sectarianism, handle religious issues prudently, convene good representative conferences of various circles, and unite all revolutionaries on the basis of the common program to participate in construction work. At the same time, he made a directive on the issue of intellectuals, included in the *Selected Works*, titled "Firmly Implementing the Party's Policy on Intellectuals," which foresightedly emphasized the importance of absorbing various types of intellectuals to participate in construction work and sharply criticized the ignorant and bad practices of some people in the revolutionary ranks who looked down on intellectuals.

Sincerely uniting a large number of cadres, not arbitrarily persecuting people; using cadres with principles, not appointing people based on personal relationships; highly trusting cadres with both virtue and talent, and giving them full play to their creativity; implementing the principle of unity-criticism-unity for cadres with mistakes. All these are not small matters but major issues in leadership work, which are important parts of the Party's style that must be adhered to and carried forward. Li Xiannian set an example in this aspect.

Third, Li Xiannian was good at learning in his work, especially through continuously summarizing experience to learn from practice, and was not afraid to conduct self-criticism. During the editing of the *Selected Works*, from the experience of an older-generation proletarian revolutionary, we deeply felt that China's revolutionary and construction cause is a long-term and arduous cause. This long-term nature and complexity include the stage nature formed by the continuous changes in the objective situation, as well as the changes in the tasks and forms of struggle, requiring every revolutionary, especially the Party's leaders, to follow the principles of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, continuously summarize experience, seriously learn from practice, including learning from failures and setbacks, humbly explore the objective laws in different situations, and master the ways of struggle and work that conform to these laws.

Many articles in the *Selected Works* reflect Li Xiannian's spirit of learning from practice. In every new situation and task, he always paid attention to boldly opening up the situation and also valued timely summarizing experience. In the anti-Japanese base area in the border region of Hubei and Henan, after he organized and united many scattered forces to carry out and persist in anti-Japanese guerrilla warfare in the local area, he immediately convened a meeting to summarize experience (*Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Warfare in the Border Region of Hubei and Henan*). Through summarization, the objective and subjective situations were analyzed more comprehensively and systematically, the scattered and fragmented combat experience was concentrated, and the existing difficulties and shortcomings were exposed, which unified thoughts and clarified the direction for further struggle. It was the same during his work in Hubei. During his leadership of financial and commercial work at the central government, his many important speeches and articles on financial and commercial work were almost all summaries of the experience of a period of work. The several important works in the mid-1950s were preliminary summaries of the experience of the initial few years of socialist economic construction and were also preliminary attempts to reform some drawbacks that had just appeared in the socialist economic system that had been rapidly established. The several important works at the end of the 1950s and the beginning of the 1960s were summaries of the lessons of the 1958 "Great Leap Forward" errors and the experience of overcoming the three years of difficulties. The several important works at the end of the 1970s and the beginning of the 1980s were summaries of the experience of economic adjustment in the new historical period. The multiple talks with foreign guests in 1987 were summaries of some experiences of reform and opening up. When he summarized experience, he not only dared to face reality, analyze past gains and losses, and obtain a more objective understanding, but also, based on this understanding, proposed suggestions for further improving work, sometimes even summarizing relatively clear principles and specific boundaries for future work.

Li Xiannian often said to people that he came from a very poor family when he was young, could not afford to go to school, and started learning carpentry at the age of over ten. After joining the revolution, he was in a war environment for a long time, with little time to study, and his cultural and knowledge levels were not high. These words not only expressed his respect for knowledge and care for intellectuals but also explained the origin of his precious character of paying attention to diligent learning and summarizing experience throughout his life. With his background and experience, he could quickly familiarize himself with commanding wars after joining the revolution, quickly familiarize himself with state construction after the founding of the nation, and quickly familiarize himself with financial and commercial work after going to work at the central government. An important reason for this was that he paid great attention to learning Mao Zedong Thought and was good at learning from practice.

In the process of summarizing experience and learning from practice, Li Xiannian dared to expose the problems in our work, admit the mistakes in our work, and dared to conduct self-criticism, taking responsibility for what he should be responsible for. Whether it was the summary of the mistakes in 1958 and the subsequent overcoming of difficulties, or the summary of the economic imbalance before and after 1978 and the subsequent adjustment work, he first comprehensively analyzed the situation and truthfully presented the problems. At the same time, he analyzed the problems with a positive attitude, affirmed what should be affirmed to protect the masses' initiative, and denied what should be denied to seek ways to overcome. This is an important reason why he could continuously learn new things and new experiences and rise from perceptual knowledge to rational knowledge. His attitude and methods are still very enlightening for the majority of leading cadres. Now, in our construction work, including reform and opening up, we should, as Comrade Deng Xiaoping recently pointed out, seriously summarize experience. Seriously means to seriously treat the various problems that have occurred. We have nearly forty years of history of socialist construction, including ten years of reform and opening up, and the experience is very rich. We should find several principles that truly conform to China's reality and reflect objective laws from the summary of experience, use them to guide the Party's future actions, avoid mistakes, take fewer detours, and smoothly reach our short-term and long-term goals along the socialist road.

Seeking truth from facts, uniting cadres, learning from practice, etc., the above characteristics are all aspects that Comrade Mao Zedong has repeatedly pointed out, and they are important aspects of Mao Zedong Thought. The precious thing is that in these aspects, Li Xiannian did them seriously and solidly and did them relatively well. Of course, he has many other good work styles worthy of people's learning, which will not be listed and explained one by one here. Attentive readers can obtain many benefits from the *Selected Works*, especially Communist Party members, who can improve their Party spirit and enhance their cultivation through learning.

During the editing of the book, we further understood the statement that "Mao Zedong Thought is the application and development of Marxism-Leninism in China, is the correct theoretical principles and experience summaries about the Chinese revolution that have been proven by practice, and is the crystallization of the collective wisdom of the Communist Party of China." From this, we also obtained an important enlightenment, that is, Mao Zedong Thought will develop and improve with the broad practice, but its basic principles, the Marxism-Leninism stance, viewpoint, and method it embodies, and its basic aspects, that is, the three major contents of seeking truth from facts, the mass line, and independence, will guide our actions for a long time and will forever illuminate the road to victory for the Chinese people.

　　学习老一辈无产阶级革命家优良的思想作风
    《李先念文选》编辑小组
    现在同读者见面的《李先念文选》，篇幅不算很多，但基本反映了作者半个多世纪革命生涯艰难而光荣的历程。
    正如读者从《文选》中可以清楚看到的，李先念同志如同其他许多老一辈无产阶级革命家一样，把一生的精力和心血都奉献给党、国家和人民的事业。从工作性质划分，他的革命经历可以分为三个时期。
    李先念同志从１９２６年参加革命，到全国解放前夕的２３年中，主要从事武装斗争。他经历了红军长征这一举世闻名的壮举。他在西路军斗争中，为中国工农红军的战斗历史写下了悲壮的一页。在抗日战争初期，他带领几十名干部从延安南下，到豫南鄂北敌后组建抗日武装和开辟根据地。在环境十分复杂、斗争异常艰苦的条件下，他运用毛泽东同志指明的游击战争的战略战术，和抗日统一战线的政策策略，发动并依靠各阶层的抗日群众，采取机动灵活的作战方法，坚决抗击日本侵略军和伪军，同时对国民党反共顽固派进行有理有利有节的斗争。在不到七年时间内，建成了有五万多主力部队、三十万民兵、纵横千里、环绕武汉的具有重大战略意义的鄂豫边根据地。从《文选》中可以体会到，李先念同志在这一时期，已经可以在复杂的环境中，独立自主地开辟工作，指挥较大范围的作战，领导广大地区的人民群众进行斗争，成为比较成熟的无产阶级革命家了。
    从１９４９年到１９５４年，李先念同志主持湖北省的党政工作，同时参与中南局的领导工作。在新的革命任务面前，作者系统地调查当地的情况，卓有成效地完成党中央提出的各项任务，从而确立了当地的人民民主专政的政权，恢复和发展了经济、文化、教育等事业。他尤其注意抓紧农业的生产和建设，特别是农田水利的建设，为湖北以后成为全国重要的农业生产基地打下了坚实基础。李先念同志同许多老一辈无产阶级革命家一样，在革命胜利后，遵从毛泽东同志的教导，没有骄傲自满，没有停顿不前，而是用心去学习许多不懂的东西。同时，在建国初期百废待兴、任务十分繁重的情况下，他能够抓紧中心工作，又能围绕中心工作开展其他方面的工作。他作为一省领导班子的“班长”，带领、团结全班人员同心协力，把各项工作都干得生气勃勃。这一时期，李先念同志在掌握一个地区的全局方面，已经成为一位比较出色的领导者。
    １９５４年，李先念同志奉调来中央，主要负责领导财政、银行、商业、外贸、物价等部门的工作。“文化大革命”期间，他“靠边站”一段时间以后，先后协助周恩来、邓小平同志处理经济事务，为稳定国民经济和人民生活作了力所能及的努力。在党的十一届三中全会上被选为党的重要领导人以后，他仍和陈云同志一道主管经济。大家知道财贸工作，比专业部门要复杂得多，比综合部门又要具体得多。国民经济的重大比例关系如果失衡，首先会反映到财政、信贷和市场、物价上来；而比例关系的调整和协调，又必须先从平衡财政和信贷的收支、稳定市场物价入手。李先念同志较快较好地掌握了这方面的情况和规律，为保证国民经济的稳定发展起了积极的作用。在《文选》中，这一时期的著作约占全书的三分之二，这方面的内容是全书最为丰富、最为生动的部分。
    在长时期内，李先念同志在经济建设工作方面，是一贯主张财政不打赤字，货币发行严格控制，外汇量入为出，市场物价保持稳定这些原则的。他认为，基本建设必须量力而行，人民生活的改善必须同生产发展相适应，不要去做力所不及的事情。为了保障国民经济持续稳定发展，他坚持国民经济计划必须经过综合平衡，主要是财政、信贷、物资、外汇的平衡，并且照顾年度间的衔接，以免发生大的起伏。李先念同志认为，有计划按比例是社会主义经济必须遵循的规律，不论在任何情况下都是不能违反的。他积极主张发展商品经济和运用价值规律，坚持改革、开放和搞活经济。同时认为，发展商品经济，总体上是要发展公有制为基础的有计划的商品经济。在改革、开放和搞活经济的条件下更应切实加强宏观控制，包括生产速度、基建规模、产业结构、消费水平，以及财政、信贷、市场、物价等等。为此，放权要适当，以免发生各种失控现象。他还坚决主张，在加强物质文明建设的同时，必须加强精神文明的建设，这就要求毫不放松思想政治工作，毫不削弱党的领导。
    李先念同志认为，在社会主义经济建设中，有计划按比例这一条，决不能丢掉。发展商品经济，也要有计划按比例。常识告诉人们，资本主义的商品经济，也是要求按比例的，比例失调就要出现危机，严重失调就会出现严重危机。自从三十年代初世界性经济大危机后，许多资本主义国家的政府领导人及经济学家，都在寻求避免危机的办法，最重要的一条是加强宏观控制和调节措施。它们主要是采取税收、信贷、预算分配进行调节的，有的还要通过法律法规和行政手段去进行。我们是社会主义国家，更需要也更有条件这样做，不能把计划看成是生产力发展的障碍。至于过去计划体制的弊病和计划工作中的缺点，如集中过多、统得过死等等，当然应该加以改革和改正。在党的十一届三中全会以后不久，陈云同志就提出经济活动不能只有计划，应有市场调节的部分。在收入《文选》的著作中，李先念同志也多次论述过计划和市场的关系。经验证明，有了符合实际能进行宏观控制的统一计划，又有能使经济增强活力的市场调节，我们经济建设事业的兴旺发达，就可以得到基本的保证。
    纵观《文选》三个时期的内容，可以看出，李先念同志经历了长期的革命和建设的实践，具有丰富的经验，因此也就能够比较全面地深入地掌握毛泽东思想，为人民的事业作出杰出的贡献，并将继续作出贡献。这是李先念同志、也是所有老一辈无产阶级革命家受到全党和全国人民尊敬的根本原因。他们坚强的党性、献身的精神，良好的作风，都是值得我们广大党员和干部努力学习的。这对于在各级领导岗位上比较年轻的负责干部，尤其重要。把我们党以无数烈士鲜血换来的优良传统，一代一代地传下去，保持和提高党在广大人民群众中的政治威信，是我国社会主义现代化建设事业取得成功的重要保证。
    李先念同志在学习和运用毛泽东思想方面，有几个突出的特点，这是我们在编辑他的文稿过程中深刻感受到的，并且使我们在思想上深受教育。
    第一点，李先念同志对中央的各项正确决策和指示，是坚决执行的，真正做到贯彻始终，坚定不移。但他在执行中，并不照搬硬套，总是努力把它与自己所领导的地区或方面的实际相结合，先调查研究，了解情况，然后从实际出发，进行工作。就是说，他在任何工作中，严格遵守实事求是的原则。在四十年代创建鄂豫边敌后抗日根据地所以取得很大成功，主要因为他当时对敌友我各方面的情况都很熟悉，对当地人民的革命潜在力量以及风土民情、地理条件也很熟悉，能够从实际出发，创造性地贯彻执行党的各项方针政策。五十年代在湖北主持工作，也是如此。他到武汉后不久，即１９４９年１１月，就作了《湖北的特点和当前的政策》的报告，对湖北的经济和社会情况作了具体的分析。当时，他鉴于农村封建基础仍然原封未动，城市工业对农业的依赖等实际情况，执行了以农村为重点兼顾城市的方针，取得了显著的成效。他到中央以后，领导财贸工作，同样是从实际出发来贯彻中央的决策的。他总是以所掌握的财政、信贷、商业、粮食等方面的真实数据为依据，及时提出贯彻中央政策的办法，并及时向党中央和毛泽东同志提出建议和意见，其中包括为克服决策上的某些偏差、失误而作的艰苦努力。这种从实际出发进行工作的方法，是完全合乎毛泽东思想的精神的。实事求是是毛泽东思想的精髓，是做一切工作必须严格遵守的原则。
    从实际出发，有创造性地进行工作，说来简单，做到不易。在各项工作中，领导者主观上一般总是想实事求是的，但由于种种原因，如掌握情况不完全，思想方法有偏差，以至计较个人得失等等，结果往往并不能如愿以偿。在这个问题上，历史的经验教训多得很。关键在于能否始终保持谦虚谨慎的态度，时时处处虚心体察情况，坚持人民利益至上、真理至上的原则。从总的方面看，我们党是一个思想上政治上成熟并有组织有纪律的党，党的领导是实行民主集中制的集体，在路线和方针政策正确，党内政治生活又正常的情况下，只要自己谦虚谨慎，一般是能够做到从实际出发进行工作的。问题在于，在党内政治生活不很正常的特殊情况下，坚持实事求是就要困难得多。在五十年代中期反对右倾保守的气氛中，李先念同志及时提出要防止急躁冒进的意见。在后来的“大跃进”中，他和他领导下的财贸部门，头脑也一度发热，但到了１９５９年上半年，他就比较清醒地看到了问题，赶紧“煞车”。庐山会议期间，他在向中央的报告中，明确指出了问题的所在及其严重性，提出了调整经济的意见（见《当前财政金融中存在的问题和调整措施》一文）。这个报告，后来受到了批判，但他的观点实际上并没有改变。在三年经济困难时期，他积极参与经济调整的领导工作。１９６２年春，他在刘少奇同志支持下，主持起草了著名的严格控制货币发行和严格控制财政管理的两个决定，对扭转当时的困难局面起了很好的作用。与此相似的情况，还有１９７９年春季对国民经济的第二次调整，他坚决主张实行以调整为中心的第二个“八字方针”，并作了详尽的报告。在这一报告中，他认真总结了我国经济建设的经验，用一句话来说，就是国民经济要持续稳定地发展，不要再折腾。所有这些，都是难能可贵的。
    由上面所说的一些事实看来，实事求是和坚持真理，实际是一回事。做到实事求是，就能坚持真理；也只有敢于坚持真理，才能做到实事求是，不为各种消极因素所干扰。
    第二点，李先念同志在工作中，能够很好地团结干部，使大家心情舒畅，充分发挥自己的聪明才智和创造精神。我们在编书过程中，听到许多在他领导下工作过的同志谈起，无论在湖北工作期间或在中央工作期间，多次政治运动，他所领导的地区和部门，都竭力避免扩大化，伤人很少，大家都称赞他能尽心尽力爱护干部。至于平时，他决定问题之前，都要听取各种意见，集中大家的智慧。对不同的意见，他也能听得进去，使自己考虑问题更加周密。如果他发现某一干部在工作中有失误，在思想作风上有问题，就坦率进行批评，有时批评还很严厉。但他总是基于团结的愿望，与人为善，历史地全面地看待干部的优缺点和功过，从不随意整人，也从不重用奉迎之徒。所以，在他领导下工作，有一种信任感和安全感，有了这点，有党性的同志也就能够充分发挥积极性，尽心尽力为人民事业做好工作了。
    从《文选》中可以看出，在各个不同时期，李先念同志还善于团结广大非党干部，各党各派的民主人士和进步分子。他还特别重视团结知识分子。早在创建鄂豫边区根据地的时候，他千方百计地扩大抗日统一战线，争取和团结了一切有抗日要求的群众，一切有爱国思想的人士，包括地主分子和士绅，从而有效地实现了党的发展进步力量、争取中间力量、孤立顽固势力的策略。他十分尊重从各个方面聚拢到根据地来的有知识的人，注意增强工农干部与知识分子的团结，从而在发展根据地的过程中培养了大批干部。在湖北工作时期，李先念同志在１９５０年就写了一篇很好的文章，即收入《文选》的《加强统一战线工作》。他在文章中要求党的机关和领导干部，克服关门主义，慎重处理宗教问题，开好各界代表会议，在共同纲领基础上将一切革命的人团结起来，参加建设工作。与此同时，他对知识分子问题作了一个批示，即收入《文选》的《坚决执行党的知识分子政策》，富有远见地强调了吸收各类知识分子参加建设工作的重要性，尖锐地批评了革命队伍中某些人轻视知识分子的愚昧思想和不良作风。
    真诚地团结广大干部，不随意整人；有原则地任用干部，不任人唯亲；高度信任德才兼优的干部，放手让他们发挥创造精神；对有错误的干部认真实行团结——批评——团结的方针。所有这些，都不是小事情，而是领导工作中的大问题，是必须坚持和发扬的党的作风的重要部分。李先念同志在这一方面做出了榜样。
    第三点，李先念同志在工作中善于学习，特别是通过不断总结经验向实践学习，并且不惧怕实行自我批评。我们在编辑《文选》的过程中，从一位老一辈无产阶级革命家的经历，深刻感到中国的革命和建设事业，是长期的事业，是十分艰巨的事业。这种长期性和复杂性，包括客观形势的不断变化而形成的阶段性，以及斗争任务和形式的变换，要求每一个革命者特别是党的领导人，按照马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的原理原则，不断地总结经验，认真地向实践学习，包括从失败和挫折中学习，虚心地探索不同形势下的客观规律性，掌握适合这种规律的斗争方式和工作方式。
    《文选》的许多文章，表现了李先念同志的这种向实践学习的精神。他在每一个新的形势和任务面前，总是既注意大胆打开局面，又重视随时总结经验。在鄂豫边区根据地，当他把在当地开展和坚持抗日游击战争的许多支分散力量联系和组织起来之后不久，立即召集会议，总结经验（《豫鄂边区的抗日游击战争》）。通过总结，使主客观情况得到比较全面的系统的分析，使分散零碎的战斗经验得到集中，也使存在的困难和缺点得到揭露，这就为进一步开展斗争统一了思想，明确了方向。在湖北工作期间也是如此。在中央主持财经工作期间，他关于财贸工作的许多重要讲话和文章，几乎都是对于一段时间工作经验的总结。五十年代中期的几篇重要著作，是对社会主义经济建设最初几年经验的初步总结，也是对迅速建立起来的社会主义经济体制刚刚出现的某些弊端进行改革的初步尝试。五十年代末、六十年代初的几篇重要著作，是对１９５８年“大跃进”错误的教训和克服三年困难的经验总结。七十年代末、八十年代初的几篇重要著作，是对新的历史时期调整经济的经验总结。１９８７年同外宾的多次谈话，则是关于改革、开放的若干经验的总结。他在总结经验的时候，不仅勇于面对现实，分析过去的得失，得出比较符合客观规律性的认识，而且根据这种认识，提出进一步改进工作的建议，有时还为今后工作归纳成较为明确的原则和具体界限。
    李先念同志常对人说，自己从小家里很穷，读不起书，十多岁就去学木工，参加革命后长期处于战争环境，学习的时间不多，文化和知识水平都不高。这些话，不仅表达了他尊重知识、爱护知识分子的思想感情，也说明了他一生注意刻苦学习、注意总结经验这种可贵品德的由来。以他那样的出身经历，所以能够在参加革命后很快熟悉指挥战争，建国后很快熟悉政权建设，到中央工作后很快熟悉财经工作，重要的一条，就是十分注意学习毛泽东思想，并善于从实践中学习。
    李先念同志在总结经验、向实践学习的过程中，勇于揭露我们工作中存在的问题，承认工作中的失误，并且勇于实行自我批评，承担应该承担的责任。无论是对１９５８年的失误及其以后克服困难的总结，还是对于１９７８年前后国民经济失调及以后调整工作的总结，都是首先全面地分析情况，如实地摆出问题，同时以积极的态度进行分析，肯定应该肯定的，以保护群众的积极性，否定应该否定的，以寻求克服的办法。这是他所以能够不断学到新鲜事物、新鲜经验，从感性认识上升到理性认识的一个重要原因。他的这种态度和方法，对广大做领导工作的干部，仍是很有启发的。现在我们在建设工作方面，包括改革、开放，应该像邓小平同志不久前指出的，要认真总结经验。认真，就是要严肃对待发生的各种问题。我们有自己的将近四十年社会主义建设的历史，包括十年来的改革、开放工作，经验是很丰富的。我们应该从总结经验中，找到真正符合中国实际又反映客观规律的若干原理原则，以此指导全党今后的行动，避免失误，少走弯路，沿着社会主义大道，较为顺利地达到我们近期的和远期的目标。
    实事求是、团结干部、向实践学习等等，以上这些特点，都是毛泽东同志早就反复指出过的，都是毛泽东思想的重要方面。可贵之处在于，在这些方面，李先念同志认认真真、扎扎实实地做了，并且做得比较好。当然，他还有许多好的思想作风值得人们学习，这里就不一一列举和说明了。细心的读者，可以从《文选》中得到许多益处，特别是共产党员，可以从学习中提高自己的党性，增强自己的修养。
    我们在编书的过程中，进一步理解了“毛泽东思想是马克思列宁主义在中国的运用和发展，是被实践证明了的关于中国革命的正确的理论原则和经验总结，是中国共产党集体智慧的结晶”这一论断。由此我们还得到一个重要的启示，这就是，毛泽东思想将要随着广泛的实践而有所发展，有所提高，但它的基本原则，它所体现的马克思列宁主义的立场、观点、方法，它的基本方面，即实事求是、群众路线和独立自主三大内容，将长期指导我们的行动，将永远照耀着中国人民争取胜利的道路。
