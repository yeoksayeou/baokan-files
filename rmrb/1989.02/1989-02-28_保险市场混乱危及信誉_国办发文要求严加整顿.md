The insurance market is in disarray, threatening its reputation. The State Council Office has issued a notice requiring various levels of government, ministries, and supervisory departments to strengthen the management of the insurance industry, leveraging the role of the People's Insurance Company of China as the main channel for the country's insurance business, and conducting a thorough rectification in the first half of the year.

In recent years, some local party and government agencies and public institutions have arbitrarily established insurance businesses, using administrative power to force some units and individuals to participate in insurance. Some departments that operate their own insurance businesses have neglected the accumulation of insurance funds, using insurance premiums for production turnover or basic construction, and even distributing them as bonuses to employees. Some units, in order to attract foreign insurance business, have adopted tactics such as lowering insurance rates and increasing discounts to "compete," thereby reducing the state's foreign exchange income from insurance.

In accordance with the requirements for rectifying the economic environment and improving economic order, the State Council has approved the issuance of a notice on strengthening the management of the insurance industry. It is required that the People's Insurance Company of China actively expand its service areas, strengthen management, and improve service quality. In areas where resources are insufficient, a small number of insurance enterprises can be established as supplements, but they must strictly follow the regulations of the "Provisional Regulations on the Management of Insurance Enterprises" issued by the State Council and apply to the People's Bank of China for approval.

The notice states that, except as otherwise provided by law or specially approved by the State Council, foreign-related insurance and international reinsurance can only be operated by the People's Insurance Company of China, and other departments are not allowed to handle such business.

The People's Bank of China is the supervisory authority for the insurance industry in China. All insurance institutions must be approved by the People's Bank of China. Unauthorized insurance institutions must be thoroughly rectified and merged.

　　保险市场混乱危及信誉  国办发文要求严加整顿
    本报北京２月２７日讯  记者施明慎报道：最近，国务院办公厅发出通知，要求各级人民政府、各部委、主管部门加强对保险事业的管理，发挥中国人民保险公司在我国保险事业中的主渠道作用，并在上半年进行一次清理整顿。
    近几年来，有些地方的党政机关、事业单位擅自开办保险业务，利用行政权力，强迫一些单位和个人参加保险；有些自办保险业务的部门，忽视积累保险基金，把保险费用于生产周转或基本建设，甚至作为奖金发给职工；个别单位为了兜揽涉外保险业务，采取压低保险率、加大折扣等手段进行“竞争”，减少了国家的保险外汇收入。
    根据治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序的要求，国务院批准就加强保险事业管理发出通知，要求中国人民保险公司应积极开拓服务领域，加强经营管理，提高服务质量。在力量确实达不到的地区，可根据需要建立少数保险企业作为补充，并要严格按照国务院发布的《保险企业管理暂行条例》的规定，向中国人民银行申请批准。
    通知说，除法律、法规另有规定或经国务院特批者外，涉外保险和国际再保险只能由中国人民保险公司经营，其他部门一律不得办理。
    中国人民银行是我国保险事业的主管机关，所有保险机构应由中国人民银行审批。对不按规定建立的保险机构，要认真进行清理整顿、坚决撤并。
