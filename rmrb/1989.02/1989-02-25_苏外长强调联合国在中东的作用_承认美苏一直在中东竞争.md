Soviet Foreign Minister Emphasizes the Role of the United Nations in the Middle East
Acknowledges that the U.S. and the Soviet Union Have Been Competing in the Middle East

CAIRO, Feb. 23 (Xinhua) — Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, who is currently visiting here, said at a press conference today that only through the joint efforts of the United Nations and the Security Council member states can the Middle East problem be resolved.

The Soviet Foreign Minister said that the Soviet Union can play a role in the Middle East, and this role will not be constrained by the United States. The United States cannot solve the Middle East problem alone.

In response to a reporter's question, he acknowledged that the U.S. and the Soviet Union have been competing in resolving Middle East conflicts.

Shevardnadze also advocated for a "balance of interests" among the parties involved in the Middle East conflict to achieve a "historic compromise" and realize Middle East peace.

Earlier, Shevardnadze, in a speech to Egyptian political figures on Soviet-Egyptian bilateral relations, said that past experiences have deepened mutual understanding between the two countries and paved the way for establishing stable relations between them.

    在回答记者提问时，他承认，苏美在解决中东冲突的问题上一直在竞争。　
    谢瓦尔德纳泽还主张在中东冲突各方之间实行“利益平衡”，以便达成“历史性的妥协”，实现中东和平。
