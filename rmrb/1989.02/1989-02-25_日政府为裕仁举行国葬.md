The Japanese government held a state funeral for the late Emperor Hirohito today at Shinjuku Gyoen in Tokyo. Emperor Hirohito passed away on January 7.

Prior to this, a royal funeral was also held. Japan's opposition parties, including the Socialist Party, Komeito, the Democratic Socialist Party, and the Communist Party, did not attend the royal funeral, citing the constitutional principle of "separation of church and state."

Approximately 10,000 representatives from various regions and sectors, as well as the speakers of both houses of the Diet, attended today's funeral. Representatives and envoys from 163 countries and 27 international organizations, including U.S. President George H.W. Bush, French President François Mitterrand, First Deputy Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR Gennady Yanayev, Indonesian President Suharto, Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, United Nations Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar, and China's Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, were also in attendance. After the funeral, the emperor's coffin was taken to the Musashi Imperial Mausoleum in Hachioji, Tokyo, for burial.

At the same time as the funeral, some citizens' groups in Tokyo and other regions held rallies to protest the state funeral for Emperor Hirohito and to demand accountability for the war.

    参加今天的葬礼的，有众参两院议长、各地、各界的代表约１万人。美国总统布什、法国总统密特朗、苏联最高苏维埃主席团第一副主席鲁基亚诺夫、印尼总统苏哈托、新加坡总理李光耀、联合国秘书长德奎利亚尔、我国外长钱其琛等来自世界１６３个国家和２７个国际组织的代表及使节出席了葬礼。葬礼结束后，天皇的灵柩被送往位于东京八王子的武藏陵墓地敛葬。
    在今天举行葬礼的同时，东京及各地的一些市民团体举行集会，反对为裕仁天皇举行国葬，追究战争的责任。
