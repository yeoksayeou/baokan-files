Studying "Hot Diseases" Calmly

    Wen Niu

    After seeing the reporter Jiang Diao's comparative photographs of people buying gold jewelry over the past two years, I have some thoughts: In today's Chinese economic life, all parties need to calmly study the "hot diseases."

    While being full of vitality, the prevalence of "hot diseases" can be considered a major characteristic of China's current economic life. From a macro perspective, the phenomenon of "economic overheating" is always in a cycle of "slightly cooling and then heating up again." Investment heat, construction heat, hotel heat are everywhere. From the perspective of product production and consumption, it is one heat after another. First, there was the "cassette player heat," followed by the "electric fan heat," "refrigerator heat," and the "suit heat" rose sharply and then disappeared in an instant. The "color TV heat" lasted for a relatively long time, and the "gold jewelry heat" once swept the nation. Now people are predicting that soon there will be a "VCR heat"...

    Generally speaking, "heat" is not a derogatory term. The "heat" here actually refers to "overheating." "Overheating" is a disease, and a disease needs to be treated.

    There are many types of heat, with many causes and layers. The fundamental cause of economic overheating and investment overheating is that the flaws of the old system have not been eradicated. Certain decision-making and operational errors may be the direct cause of overheating. People's psychological maladjustment, lack of economic knowledge, blind comparison psychology, etc., may be the "additional" causes of certain hot diseases. There have been some theoretical discussions on these aspects, but they still need to be continued.

    Here, I will diagnose "hot diseases" from a specific angle in two points. The first point is that "hot diseases" are often a combination of "not in accordance with the law" and "in accordance with the law." Manufacturing industry is hotter than basic industry, which is due to the situation of low raw material prices that is not in accordance with the law. While people pursue high-efficiency manufacturing industries, this is in accordance with the law of commodity production. People rush to buy gold jewelry, which is due to the situation of currency devaluation caused by inflation that is not reasonable. While using the purchase of jewelry as a means of preserving value is an idea in accordance with economic laws. This combination of "not in accordance with the law" and "in accordance with the law" has a characteristic, that is, under the macro conditions of "not in accordance with the law," the micro level acts in the direction of value law. Therefore, to treat hot diseases, the main focus should not be on blaming micro-level problems, but rather on improving macro-level decision-making and macro-level control.

    The second point is that "hot diseases" are often the result of the interaction of actual factors and psychological factors. A certain commodity, the less there is, the more it is snatched, the more it is snatched, the less there is, the more scarce it is, the more it is hoarded, the more scarce it is, the more it is hoarded. This is the process of mutual interaction. Actual factors and psychological factors stimulate each other, often causing the heat to rise rapidly. In this regard, improving psychological factors and increasing psychological tolerance are often important aspects of easing contradictions and can be effective. It is very important for macro-level decision-makers to take measures to stabilize public sentiment. While each micro-level entity (unit, especially individuals) enters the commodity economy ocean from the stagnant product economy environment, they should also quickly adapt to the waves that frequently rise and fall there. Excessive panic and blindly chasing the wave will exacerbate the hot disease, and in the end, the one who suffers is oneself. In the recent buying spree, some consumers have already experienced this.

    From the above two points, it can be seen that studying "hot diseases" is something that decision-makers need to do, but the general public, as producers and consumers, also have a responsibility.

### 冷静地研究研究热病

　　冷静地研究研究热病
    文牛
    看了记者蒋铎拍摄的去今两年人们购买金首饰的对比照片，颇生一点感想：在当今的中国经济生活中，各方面的人士都需要冷静地研究研究“热病”。
    在充满活力的同时“热病”多发频发，可算是目前我国经济生活的一大特征。从宏观上看，“经济过热”现象始终处于“稍冷更热”的循环之中。投资热、基建热、宾馆热到处可见。从产品生产和消费的角度看，更是一热接一热。先是“收录机热”，接着是“电风扇热”、“电冰箱热”，“西服热”奇峰突起又转瞬即逝，“彩电热”则持续较久，“黄金首饰热”曾风靡一时，现在人们又在预测不久又要来个“录相机热”了……
    一般说，“热”并非贬义词，这里的“热”实际上是指“过热”。“过热”即为病。病就要治。
    多种的热，有多种的、多层次的成因。旧体制的弊端没有根除，是经济过热、投资过热的基本原因。某些决策和操作上的失当，则可能是过热的直接原因。人们心理上的不适应，经济知识的缺乏，盲目攀比心理等等，又可能是某些热病的“追加”原因。这些方面，已有若干理论上的探讨，当然仍需继续探讨。
    这里只从特定的角度，对“热病”作如下两点诊断。第一点，“热病”往往是“不合乎规律”和“合乎规律”的结合物。搞加工工业比搞基础工业要热，这是由于原材料价格偏低这种不合乎规律的情况造成的。而人们追逐高效益的加工业，这又是合乎商品生产规律的。人们抢购黄金首饰，这是由于通货膨胀使人们手中的货币贬值这种不合理的情况造成的。而把抢购首饰作为一种保值手段又是一种合乎经济规律的想法。这种“不合规律”和“合规律”的结合有一特点，那就是在“不合规律”的宏观条件下，微观按照合乎价值规律的方向去动作。所以，要治热病，主要不是指责微观的毛病，而应侧重于宏观决策、宏观调控的改善。
    第二点，“热病”往往是实际因素和心理因素交互作用的结果。某种商品，越少越抢，越抢越少，越紧俏越惜售，越惜售越紧俏，就是这种交互作用的过程。实际因素和心理因素相互刺激，往往使热度直线上升。在这里，心理因素的改善，心理承受力的提高，往往是缓解矛盾的重要方面，且容易见效。宏观决策者采取安定人心的措施相当重要。而每个微观者（单位、特别是个人）在从一潭死水的产品经济环境中投入商品经济海洋的时候，也要尽快习惯那里经常起伏着的波浪。过分恐慌，盲目赶浪头，人为地加剧了热病，最后吃亏的还是自己。前段的抢购风中，有的消费者已吃了这样的苦头。
    从上述两点可以看出，研究“热病”，是决策者们要做的事情，但广大群众作为生产者和消费者，同样有责任。
