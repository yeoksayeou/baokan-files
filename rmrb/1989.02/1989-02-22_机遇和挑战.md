Opportunities and Challenges

Currently, the globalization and regionalization of the world economy are developing simultaneously. This trend will have an important impact on the international situation. In particular, it presents both opportunities and challenges for our country, which is in the midst of reform and opening up.

In terms of economics and trade, the potential formation of an East Asian economic bloc will have the closest relationship with our country. The European Community and North America are also important partners for us. The formation of these three major economic blocs will promote regional economic growth, increase trade volume, and facilitate the flow of capital, which may be beneficial to our country. However, on the other hand, these economic blocs also have varying degrees of protectionism and exclusivity. In the future, our exported goods may face more intense competition within these economic blocs.

We should pay attention to and conduct in-depth research on this important trend in the world economy to better seize opportunities and avoid risks, and to more effectively carry out the Four Modernizations.

　　机遇和挑战
    当前，世界经济的一体化和区域化在同时发展。这一趋势对国际形势将产生重要影响。尤其是，它对于处在改革开放中的我国既提供了机遇，也提出了挑战。
    在经济和贸易方面，有可能形成的东亚经济圈同我国的关系最为密切，欧共体和北美也是我国重要的合作伙伴。三大经济圈的形成将促进地区经济增长，增加贸易量和资金流动，这可能对我国有利；但另一方面，上述经济圈又都带有程度不同的保护性和排他性。今后，我国出口商品在上述经济圈内看来会遇到更加激烈的竞争。
    我们应当重视和深入研究世界经济的这一重要发展趋势，以便趋利避害，更好地从事四化建设。
