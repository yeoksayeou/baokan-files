Japan's Prime Minister Takeshita Noboru was the first foreign leader to visit the United States after President Bush took office. The purpose of this visit was not only to establish a close personal relationship with the new U.S. President but also to engage in policy consultations on issues between the two countries and those they face together. During the talks, the two sides did not specifically address individual economic disputes but rather emphasized the "role of the U.S. and Japan in the world" and "equal partnership." They agreed to solve the problems they face through "policy coordination and joint efforts" in a calm dialogue. Notably, both sides affirmed that the "U.S.-Japan Security Treaty is the foundation of U.S.-Japan relations." The two countries, which have an alliance relationship, will in the future "creatively share responsibilities" in various forms.

In terms of policy coordination, the United States expressed its intention to address its most pressing fiscal deficit and enhance the competitiveness of its industries. Japan, on the other hand, reiterated its commitment to expanding domestic demand and opening up its domestic market. In diplomacy, given the United States' concern over Japan-Soviet relations, Japan stated that its policy towards the Soviet Union would be coordinated with the United States. Additionally, during the Japan-U.S. summit, both sides expressed their welcome of China's policy of opening up to the outside world and the improvement of Sino-Soviet relations, and stated that they would continue to cooperate with China's economic development.

The issue of "creatively sharing responsibilities" was a focal point of discussion in the local press. According to reports, the United States requested that Japan make contributions in the areas of security and increasing economic aid to overseas countries. The Japanese side, however, stated that it would make international contributions to "security" through the implementation of "appropriate and flexible" economic policies. As an economic power, Japan would actively provide aid to developing countries and debt-ridden nations. Local diplomatic circles believe that Japan's defense spending has exceeded 1% of its GDP for three consecutive years, making it the third-largest military spender in the world. The position of Japan's defense issue in the "sharing of responsibilities" between Japan and the United States is naturally a point of concern. Takeshita stated that Japan's role is to make the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty function effectively, "not in military terms but in economic cooperation and other areas," and that in the future, Japan would increase cultural exchanges and expand government development aid with the United Nations as the center. One newspaper commented that Japan has expressed its intention to expand aid to debt-ridden countries in Central and South America and Africa, "which has the color of coordinating U.S. global strategy." The opposition parties, such as the Socialist Party, believe that in the future, the United States will further demand that Japan share military responsibilities, which will lead to tensions in the Asia-Pacific region. It is believed that Japan's foreign strategy will continue to be based on Japan-U.S. coordination, while at the same time, it will strengthen its military defense capabilities in a substantial and high-quality manner. With economic strength as its backbone, it will enhance its autonomous diplomatic color and play a greater role in the economic, political, and other fields.

In terms of Japan-U.S. economic relations, U.S. scholars have likened Japan and the United States to two giant elephants walking side by side on a road. As economic power changes, the two elephants are bound to collide with each other. In this Japan-U.S. summit, although both sides avoided directly mentioning thorny economic disputes, it does not mean that economic disputes do not exist. The United States' sanctions on Japan's semiconductors have not shown any signs of being lifted, and there are still frictions in issues such as the liberalization of rice imports. Although Japan's trade surplus decreased last year, Japan's exports turned to an increasing trend in the fourth quarter. Some analysts believe that the United States is surprised that Japan has maintained strong competitiveness after overcoming the difficulties of the yen's appreciation, and that the U.S. trade deficit with Japan remains a major threat. Officials from Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry judge that frictions in the economic sphere between Japan and the United States are like cutting leeks, cutting one batch and another grows. It is believed that the degree of friction "will only increase and not decrease." Clearly, policy coordination is one thing, but when it comes to economic issues, neither side will easily give in.

The Takeshita-Bush talks brought satisfactory results to both sides. For the United States, given its relative decline in economic strength and the heavy burden of debt and fiscal and trade deficits, it needs Japan to "share global responsibilities." Japan, which advocates "contributing to the world," needs to rely on U.S. influence to increase its voice in world affairs. Whether Takeshita's visit to the United States, as said by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, has increased the breadth and depth of Japan's diplomatic choices and contributed to the world through peaceful means, remains to be seen in future actions.

### 日美：协调关系与分担责任

　　日美：协调关系与分担责任
    本报记者　孙东民
    日本首相竹下登是在布什总统上任后访问美国的第一位外国领导人。此行的目的是，除与布什新总统建立密切的个人关系外，并就两国之间及共同面临的问题进行政策协商。会谈中，双方并没有具体涉及个别的经济矛盾，而是共同强调“世界中的美日关系”、“平等的伙伴”，对面临的问题，要在平静的对话中“通过政策协调，共同作业”加以解决。引人注目的是，双方确认“日美安保条约是日美关系的基础”，有着同盟关系的日美两国今后要以各种形式“创造性地分担责任”。
    在政策协调方面，美国表示要解决最头疼的财政赤字，增强产业的竞争能力；日本则再次保证扩大内需，开放国内市场。外交方面，鉴于美国对日苏关系的关注，日本表示对苏政策将与美国保持协商。此外，日美首脑会谈中，双方还表示欢迎中国的对外开放政策和中苏改善关系，并表示继续对中国发展经济提供合作。
    “创造性地分担责任”问题，是此间报纸议论的焦点。据报道，美国要求日本在安全问题和增加对海外的经济援助方面作出贡献；日本方面则表示要通过执行“适宜而灵活的”经济政策，对“安全保障”作出国际贡献；作为经济大国，日本要积极对发展中国家和债务国进行援助。此间外交界人士认为，日本的防卫费用连续３年超过国民生产总值的１％，成为占世界第３位的军费大国，日本的防卫问题在日美“分担责任”问题中占什么位置，自然是人们关注的重点。竹下表示，日本的作用在于使日美安保条约有效地发挥机能，“不是在军事方面而是在经济合作等各个方面承担责任”，今后将以联合国为中心，增加文化交流和扩大政府开发援助。对此，一家报纸评论说，日本表示今后扩大对中南美债务国及非洲国家的援助，“带有协调美国全球战略的色彩”。社会党等在野党认为，今后美国将会进一步要求日本分担军事方面的责任，而这将会引起亚太地区形势的紧张。此间认为，日本对外战略将是继续以日美协调为基轴，一方面实实在在地增强高质量的军事防卫实力，同时以经济实力为后盾，增强自主外交色彩，在经济、政治等领域进一步发挥作用。
    在日美经济关系方面，美国学者把日美比喻成在一条路上并行的两头巨象，随着经济实力的变化，两头巨象不可避免地要相互碰撞。在这次日美首脑会谈中，虽然双方都避免直接提及棘手的经济矛盾，但并不意味着经济矛盾不存在。美国对日本的半导体制裁尚无解除的迹象，在大米进口自由化等问题上，双方摩擦依旧。去年日本的对外贸易顺差虽有所减少，但第４季度日本的出口又转增势。有人分析，美国对日本渡过日元升值的难关后仍保持着强大的竞争力感到惊异，对日贸易赤字仍是重大威胁。日本通产省人士判断，日美经济领域的摩擦如同割韭菜，割了一茬又长一茬，今后摩擦的程度“只会增强不会减弱”。可见，政策协调是一回事，面对经济问题，双方都不会轻易让步。
    竹下布什会谈，给各自带来了满意的成果。对美国来说，鉴于自身的经济实力相对下降，又担负着沉重的债务和财政、贸易双赤字的包袱，需要日本“分担世界规模的责任”；以“向世界作贡献”为口号的日本，需要借重美国的影响增加对世界事务的发言权。竹下美国之行，是否如日本外务当局所说的增加了日本外交选择的幅度和深度，通过和平手段对世界作出贡献，还有待于观察今后的实际行动。
