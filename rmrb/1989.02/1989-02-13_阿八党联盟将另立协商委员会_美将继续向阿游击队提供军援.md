The Afghan Eight-Party Alliance will establish another consultative committee on liberated Afghan territory.

	The chairman of the Eight-Party Alliance based in Iran, Khalili, said last night that his alliance would establish another committee. Khalili arrived here a few days ago. He said he would return to Tehran to begin implementing the plan to establish the committee.

	The Eight-Party Alliance boycotted the first meeting of the Afghan Consultative Committee held here on February 10. The reason was that the Eight-Party Alliance demanded 100 to 120 seats, while the Seven-Party Alliance based in Pakistan only agreed to give it 60 seats.

	Yesterday, the Islamic Union Committee based in Iran accused the Seven-Party Alliance of breaking the agreement and claimed that a government without the participation of all Muslim representatives could not solve the Afghan crisis.

	The New York Times reported today that U.S. President Bush announced that as long as the Soviet-backed Kabul regime remains in power, the United States will continue to provide military aid to the Afghan Mujahideen in principle.

	The newspaper quoted a senior U.S. official as saying that as long as Najibullah is in power, there is a potential Soviet threat.

	The newspaper said that on February 10, Bush accepted the suggestion of senior foreign policy advisers to continue providing aid to the Mujahideen at the National Security Council meeting.

	These officials believe that although Soviet troops will have completely withdrawn from Afghanistan by February 15, they will leave a large amount of military equipment for the Kabul regime.

	The United States provided approximately $600 million in military aid to the Mujahideen last year.

　　阿八党联盟将另立协商委员会    
    美将继续向阿游击队提供军援
    新华社伊斯兰堡２月１２日电  据此间报纸今天报道，以伊朗为基地的阿富汗抵抗力量八党联盟主席哈利利昨天晚间在这里说，他的联盟将在阿富汗解放的领土上建立另一个协商委员会。
    哈利利于几天前抵达这里。他说他将返回德黑兰，开始实施建立委员会的计划。
    八党联盟抵制了２月１０日在此间举行的阿富汗协商委员会第一次会议，其原因是八党联盟要求拥有１００个至１２０个席位，而以巴基斯坦为基地的七党联盟只答应给它６０个席位。
    昨天，以伊朗为基地的伊斯兰联盟委员会指责七党联盟破坏协议，并声称，没有所有穆斯林代表参加的政府是无法解决阿富汗危机的。
    新华社华盛顿２月１１日电《纽约时报》今天报道，美国总统布什宣布，只要苏联支持的喀布尔政权继续执政，美国就将在原则上继续向阿富汗游击队提供军事援助。
    该报援引一位美国高级官员的话说，只要纳吉布拉掌权，就存在着苏联的潜在威胁。
    这家报纸说，布什１０日在国家安全委员会会议上接受了外交政策高级顾问们继续向阿游击队提供援助的建议。
    这些官员认为，尽管到本月１５日为止苏联军队将全部撤出阿富汗，但他们将给喀布尔政权留下大量军事装备。
    美国去年向阿游击队提供的军援总额约为６亿美元。
