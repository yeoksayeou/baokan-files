Now, on average, there are 3 flights departing from Hohhot every day; 18 routes within and outside the autonomous region have closely linked the Inner Mongolian grasslands with other parts of the country.

Ten years ago, the Inner Mongolia Civil Aviation Bureau did not have its own aircraft, nor did it have its own trained stewardesses. It could only handle general aviation tasks and transit services for scheduled flights. The runways in the region could only accommodate small aircraft like the An-24 and below, and there were very few routes to areas outside the region.

　　内蒙古民航展翅
    据新华社呼和浩特２月２７日电  （通讯员高梦雄、记者凌广志）现在，平均每天有３班飞机从呼和浩特起飞；自治区内外的１８条航线密切了内蒙古大草原与国内其它地区的联系。
    １０年前，内蒙古民航局还没有自己的飞机，没有自己培养的航空小姐，仅能承担通用航空任务和班机的过站保障工作；区内机场跑道只能起降安—２４以下的小型飞机，飞往区外的航线更是寥寥无几。
