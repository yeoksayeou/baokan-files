Stockholm is composed of many islands. Skansen is the name of a large island. At the end of the year, the annual Skansen Temple Fair is held in the village market street here.

We usually don't miss the Beijing Temple Fair during the Spring Festival. This time, hearing that there is a foreign temple fair to visit, our spirits immediately became excited.

Sunday is the time for a lazy morning. We made an exception and got up early. There were few people on the street, and the strong north wind blew snowflakes, hitting the car windows. Swedes generally don't go out until noon. Just as I was doubting whether anyone could get up so early to visit the fair, the car turned a corner, and from a distance, I saw many people gathered at the park entrance.

The market is conducted in the simple style characteristic of the Swedes. There is no drumming or performing tricks to attract customers. People are quiet and orderly. A long, narrow village market street, with dozens of stalls lined up one by one. The usually empty warehouses are now filled with various festive items. Each stall is decorated with straw weaving, paper cutting, pine branches, and hanging lanterns. The stall owners, dressed in bright traditional national costumes, are busy behind the crowded counters, some lightly made up, others heavily made up. In the middle of the market stands a giant horse made of woven straw. The horse's body is wrapped in red cloth, making it very eye-catching. Photography enthusiasts eagerly raise their cameras, snapping pictures of people visiting the fair.

Perhaps in all countries of the world, festivals cannot do without these two items: delicious food and gifts.

The Skansen market also operates in these two categories. Here, from Christmas cards to homemade black beer, everything is available. It lacks the folk art performances of the Beijing Temple Fair. But its characteristic is the strong local flavor. Because no matter how much money you spend, you can't buy these things in stores. Those who come with children always first satisfy the little ones' demand for candy. Housewives crowd around the bakery to buy black bread that is as hard as stone, and occasionally pick up a jar of homemade butter or jam to smell. Men with red faces and heavy breathing circle around the stalls selling bacon and sausages, especially paying attention to the smoked hams hanging from the eaves. The elderly are interested in traditional straw weaving and wood carving. The most indecisive are the young people, who hesitate in front of the stalls selling handmade greeting cards and toys, unsure of what to give to their loved ones.

There is a type of "lottery" sales method. You don't buy the goods, but spend two kronor to buy a lottery ticket. If you win, you can get a free item from the stall. The highest prize can be a large basket of sausages or a large teddy bear. These stalls are particularly crowded, with everyone hoping for good luck.

Around noon, people start to feel hungry. At this time, the food stalls are very busy, with several layers of people around them. Everyone buys two pieces of bread, wraps them with blood sausage, and toasts them over the fire, eating while enjoying the North European waterfowl resting on the ice, which is quite interesting. Nearby, the church bells ring slowly. For some reason, at this moment, I particularly want to eat the candy apples from the Beijing Temple Fair…

### 瑞典的庙会

　　瑞典的庙会
　　袁放生
    斯德哥尔摩由众多的岛屿组成。斯甘森是一个大岛的名字，岁末，一年一度的斯甘森庙会就在这里的乡村集市街进行。
    往常每年春节都少不了逛北京庙会的我们，这下听说有外国庙会可逛，精神顿时兴奋起来。
    星期天是睡懒觉的时间，破例起个大早。街上行人稀少，强劲的北风卷起雪花，打在汽车窗户的玻璃上。瑞典人一般要到中午时才出门。正在我怀疑是否有人能起这么早来逛庙会时，汽车已经拐弯，远远地望见公园门口聚集着不少人。
    集市以瑞典人特有的简朴方式进行。没有敲锣打鼓，没有耍把式卖噱头的，人们静静悄悄。一条狭长的乡村街市，一个挨一个排着几十个货摊。平时空荡荡的货栈，现在堆满了各式各样的节日用品。每个摊棚用草编、剪贴、松枝和挂灯装饰起来。身着鲜艳的传统民族服装的货栈主人，淡抹浓装，在挤满人的柜台后面忙碌着。市场中间耸立起一匹巨大的用草编成的马，马身用红布扎起来，很惹人注意。摄影爱好者们纷纷举起像机，抢着拍些人们赶庙会的镜头。
    也许世界上所有国家的节日，都少不了这样两项内容，即美食和馈赠。
    斯甘森市场的经营也分这两类。这里从圣诞卡一直到家酿黑啤酒应有尽有，它比北京庙会少一项民间艺术表演的内容。但其特色在于浓郁的乡土风味。因为这里的东西你花任何价钱在商店里也是买不到的。那些带小孩来的人，总是要首先满足小家伙儿对糖果的要求。家庭主妇们挤在面包坊买冻得像石头一样硬的黑面包，并不时地抓起一罐家制黄油或果酱闻闻。满脸通红、喘着粗气的男人们，在腊肉和香肠的货栈前转来转去，特别瞩意那挂在屋檐下的熏火腿。老年人则对传统的草编和木雕感兴趣。最拿不定主意的是年轻人，他们在手工制作的贺年卡和玩具摊前徘徊，不知该送给意中人什么礼物。
    有一种叫“抽彩”的销售方法，你不是买商品，而是花两克朗买一个彩票。如中奖，可免费得到一件摊上的东西。最高奖可以得到一大筐香肠或一只大布熊。这种摊位前人特别多，大家都想碰好运气。
    正午时分，人们肚子有些饿了。这时食品摊的生意特别好，围了几层人。大家买上两块面包，夹上泥肠，放在火上自己烤，边吃边欣赏在冰面上栖息的北欧水鸟，别有一番情趣。近处，教堂的钟声缓缓敲响。不知怎么，这时我特别想吃北京庙会的糖葫芦……
