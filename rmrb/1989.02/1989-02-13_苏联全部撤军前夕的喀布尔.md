On the eve of the Soviet Union's complete withdrawal from Afghanistan, the resistance forces' direct attacks on the city of Kabul have relatively decreased. There are no longer any Soviet soldiers visible in Kabul, and the Soviet military positions in the suburbs have been taken over by the Kabul government's army. Residents of Kabul, whether they are workers, farmers, students, merchants, or religious figures, all welcome the Soviet withdrawal. They believe this is a victory for the Afghan nation. However, as the Soviet troops are about to withdraw completely, due to the armed standoff between the opposing political forces within Afghanistan, the atmosphere in Kabul is tense. People in military uniforms are everywhere, and many young men carry assault rifles, moving in groups of three or five, hurriedly coming and going. These are special forces established to counter the guerrilla attacks. According to official announcements, the People's Democratic Party, which is in power in Kabul, has armed many of its members. On February 5, they held an armed rally and demonstration in the city center. The leader of the Kabul government, Najibullah, spoke at the rally in a camouflage uniform. He was emotionally charged and his words were strong, expressing his determination to defend the government with blood and life, preventing the opposition from seizing Kabul. The intense atmosphere gave foreign journalists the impression that martial law had begun.

After the closure of embassies from the United States, Britain, Japan, and other Western countries, Kabul rarely sees vehicles with diplomatic flags. The remaining foreign embassies have also taken precautionary measures, with some stacking sandbags and others rebuilding roads in front of the embassy for helicopter takeoffs and landings. This has added to the tense atmosphere.

The blockade by the resistance forces and the severe winter cold have made supplies to Kabul extremely difficult, leading to soaring prices and public unrest. Due to the scarcity of goods, merchants try to sell at the highest possible prices. A single battery costs 50 afghanis (about $1), and a liter of gasoline costs 250 afghanis. Such high prices are indeed difficult for Afghans to accept. The market in Kabul has no shortage of fabrics, clothing, and shoes, but due to the high prices, business is sluggish. A shop owner said that his monthly earnings of 5,000 afghanis can only buy about 20 kilograms of rice in the market, making it difficult to support a family of seven.

Food shortages are the biggest threat to the residents of Kabul. At 4 AM, long lines form in front of the grain stores in the biting cold. The government rations bread, allowing each person to buy five loaves per visit. An elderly woman said she had been waiting for five hours but still hadn't bought any bread. Her family of 12 has five people dedicated to queuing for bread, yet it's still hard to ensure everyone eats enough. According to the Kabul Commerce Bureau, the Soviet Union has urgently sent 5,700 tons of flour and plans to send another 7,500 tons to alleviate the food shortage.

Many residents of Kabul seem to have adapted to the long-term war environment. Along the Kabul River, which runs through the city, there are stalls stretching for several kilometers. From 10 AM to 4 PM, the area is bustling with people selling fruits, vegetables, eggs, meat, and various snacks. Some vendors shout loudly to attract customers. However, after 10 PM, the streets are deserted, with only patrol cars and armed soldiers on duty at the intersections.

Walking through Kabul, many scenes are shocking. Out of the city's population of over 2 million, more than 1 million are refugees who have fled from various parts of the country to escape the war. They live in makeshift huts and mud houses. The war is still ongoing. Kabul Radio has a program dedicated to broadcasting obituaries, where the announcer solemnly reads a long list of names every morning, notifying the relatives of the deceased of the mourning date.

The war-torn residents of Kabul yearn for peace after the Soviet withdrawal but are skeptical about whether peace can be achieved soon. Government employee Rashid told the reporter: "The situation we face is that both the resistance organizations and the People's Democratic Party have 200,000 armed forces. Both sides are stockpiling weapons with the help of foreign countries. The resistance organizations want the People's Democratic Party to hand over power, while the People's Democratic Party advocates that all political forces share power on an equal basis. Will they be able to compromise? I am a Muslim and can only say 'Insha'Allah' (meaning 'God willing')!" It can be said that Rashid's words reflect the feelings of most residents of Kabul.

### 苏联全部撤军前夕的喀布尔

　　苏联全部撤军前夕的喀布尔
    新华社记者  马光  葛相文
    苏军全部撤出阿富汗前夕的喀布尔，抵抗力量游击队直接袭击市区的活动相对减少。在喀布尔市已看不见苏联士兵，郊区苏军阵地已由喀布尔政府军接防。喀布尔居民，无论是工人、农民、学生，还是商人和宗教人士，对苏军撤走都是欢迎的。他们认为这是阿富汗民族的胜利。但是，当苏军即将全部撤走的时候，由于阿富汗国内敌对政治势力的武装对峙，喀布尔的气氛是紧张的。身穿军服的人比比皆是，许多青年人手持冲锋枪，三五成群，来去匆匆。这是为应付游击队进攻而建立的特种部队。据官方宣布，在喀布尔执政的人民民主党已把许多党员武装起来。２月５日他们在市中心广场举行了武装集会和示威游行。喀布尔政权领导人纳吉布拉身穿迷彩军服在集会上讲话。他情绪激动，措词强烈，表示要用鲜血和生命来保卫政权，防止反对派武装攻占喀布尔。浓烈的气氛使外国记者产生这样的印象：这里仿佛开始“实行军管了”。
    美国、英国、日本等西方国家关闭使馆以后，喀布尔很少看到挂着使团旗子的车辆。现存的外国使馆也采取了应变措施，有的堆起了沙袋，有的在使馆门前改建道路，以供直升飞机起降。这增加了这里的紧张气氛。
    抵抗力量游击队的封锁以及冰雪严寒使喀布尔的供应极其困难，因而物价飞涨，人心浮动。由于货源紧张，商人就争取以尽可能高的价格来出售。一节电池要卖５０阿尼（约合１美元），一公升汽油要卖２５０阿尼。这样昂贵的价格对阿富汗人来说确实难以接受。喀布尔市场上布匹、衣服和鞋等商品并不短缺。但由于价格太贵，生意清淡。一位布店主人说，他一月挣的５０００阿尼，在市场上只能买到２０多公斤大米，全家７口人的生活难以维持。
    粮食短缺是对喀布尔市民的最大威胁，凌晨４时，在刺骨的寒风中，粮店门前就排上了长队。政府对大饼实行限量供应，每人每次可买５个。一位老年妇女说，她已排了５小时，还没有买到大饼。她全家１２口人，每天有５人专门排队买大饼，还难以保证都吃饱。据喀布尔商业局宣布，苏联紧急运来５７００吨面粉，计划再运来７５００吨，以缓解食品短缺的局面。
    喀布尔的许多居民对长期的战争环境似乎已经适应了，在横贯市区的喀布尔河岸绵延数公里的摊贩市场上，从上午１０时到下午４时，人群熙熙攘攘，水果、蔬菜、鸡蛋、牛羊肉和各种小吃应有尽有。一些小贩挤在人群中高声叫卖，招徕顾客。但是夜里１０时后，街道上行人绝迹，只有巡逻的警车。荷枪实弹的士兵在路口值勤。
    漫步喀布尔，不少景象触目惊心。全市２００多万人口中有１００多万是为躲避战乱从全国各地逃来的难民。他们栖息在简陋的棚屋和泥房里。战争仍在进行着。喀布尔电台有个专门发布讣告的节目，每天早晨播音员都用深沉的音调宣布一大串的名单，用这种方式把悼念的日期通知给受难者的亲友们。
    饱经战争灾难的喀布尔市民渴望在苏军撤走后恢复国内的和平，但又非常怀疑和平是否能够早日实现。政府雇员拉希德告诉记者说：“我们面临的局面是，抵抗组织和人民民主党都拥有２０万人的武装，双方都在外国的帮助下装满了自己的军火库，抵抗组织要人民民主党交出政权，而人民民主党则主张各派政治势力在平等的基础上分享权力。他们是否能够妥协呢？我是一个穆斯林，只能说‘因沙安拉’（意思是愿上帝保佑）！”可以说，拉希德的话反映了大多数喀布尔居民的心情。
