A certain regiment in Fuzhou City has vigorously developed the pig farming industry. Over the past three years, in addition to meeting its own needs, it has supplied nearly 30,000 marketable pigs to the local market. To reduce the pressure on the local market and alleviate the burden on the people, this regiment began to establish pig farming operations in early 1986. Each year, it raises more than 10,000 pigs, and after meeting its own needs, the rest are all supplied to the local market.
