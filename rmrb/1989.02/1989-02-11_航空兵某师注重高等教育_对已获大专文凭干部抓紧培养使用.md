The air force regiment of the Nanjing Military Region emphasizes the higher education of its officers and promotes the use of those who have already obtained bachelor's degrees, thereby advancing the construction of the unit.

In 1986, after completing the task of universalizing secondary education among officers four years ahead of schedule, the regiment allocated 200,000 yuan to send officers to enroll in universities. They also commissioned Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing University, and other institutions to establish on-campus bachelor's degree programs. They have systematically and step-by-step promoted the universalization of higher education among officers. By the end of last year, the regiment had hundreds of officers who had obtained bachelor's degrees, accounting for 51.1% of the total number of officers. Currently, there are 273 officers still undergoing training.

For officers who have already obtained bachelor's degrees, the regiment has been quick to cultivate and utilize them. In their work, they are given responsibilities to enhance their skills in practice, transforming knowledge into ability. For example, the 4th Maintenance Squadron of a certain regiment was originally a backward unit with many problems. After Yu Binggen, a graduate of a political academy, became the political instructor of the squadron, he used the principles of "management science" to guide the construction of the company. In just one year, he turned the company into a model unit.

In emphasizing the higher education of officers, the regiment has shifted from universal education to intellectual development. Their approach includes: strengthening horizontal connections among officers, frequently holding seminars on political and ideological work, encouraging officers to study new problems and summarize new experiences in conjunction with their duties; selecting individuals with innovative spirits to form various technical groups, learning modern military technology, updating knowledge, and developing the creativity of officers; establishing a scientific and technological cooperation network with military and local research institutions, allowing outstanding individuals to showcase their talents in high-level scientific research activities.

　　航空兵某师注重高等教育    
    对已获大专文凭干部抓紧培养使用
    本报讯  南京军区空军航空兵某师注重干部高等教育，注重开发已获得大专文凭干部的创造力，促进了部队的建设。
    １９８６年，这个师在全军提前４年完成干部普及中等教育任务后筹资２０万元，采取选送干部报考院校，委托南京航空学院、南京大学等院校开办军营大专班，有计划有步骤地普及干部高等教育。截至去年底，该师有数百名干部获得了大专文凭，占干部总人数的５１．１％，目前还有２７３名正在校培训。
    对已取得大专文凭的干部，这个师抓紧培养使用。工作上压担子，让他们在实践中增长才干，变知识为能力。某团机务４中队，原是问题较多的后进单位，从政治院校毕业的俞炳根到中队任指导员后，他用“管理科学”原理指导连队建设，仅一年功夫就使这个连队加入了先进行列。
    在注重干部高等教育中，这个师变普及教育为智力开发。他们的做法是：加强干部横向联系，经常召开政治思想工作等专题研讨会，促进干部结合本职工作研究新问题，总结新经验；挑选有开拓精神的人才，组成各种科技小组，学习现代军事技术，更新知识，开发军官的创造力；同军内和地方科研单位建立科技协作网络，让冒尖人才在高层次的科研活动中施展才能。　　（盛瑞翔　杨维祥）
