	Bush: U.S. Not Hasty in Formulating New Middle East Policy; Soviet Union Should Play a Secondary Role
		Xinhua News Agency, Washington, February 22

	U.S. President Bush said today that he will not rush to formulate a new policy for resolving the Arab-Israeli conflict due to the diplomatic actions taken by the Soviet Union in the Middle East.

	Bush said at a White House press conference, "I am not worried about Mr. Shevardnadze's visit to Middle Eastern countries." He believes that the Soviet Union should only play a "secondary role" in this region. Bush said that he plans to meet with Jordanian King Hussein, Egyptian President Mubarak, and Israeli President Chaim Herzog during his visit to Japan for the Emperor's funeral.

	He said that the U.S. policy towards the Middle East is to encourage "discussions" between Jordan and Israel and to hope for the continuation of this process that has already begun.

　　布什：美不急于制定新中东政策  苏在中东只应起次要作用
    新华社华盛顿２月２２日电  美国总统布什今天说，他不会因为苏联对中东采取的外交行动而急于制定一项新的解决阿以冲突的政策。
    布什在白宫记者招待会上说，“我对谢瓦尔德纳泽先生对中东国家的走访并不担忧”。他认为苏联在这一地区应当只起“次要作用”。布什说，他计划在日本参加天皇葬礼期间将会见约旦国王侯赛因、埃及总统穆巴拉克和以色列总统哈伊姆·赫尔佐克。
    他说，美国对中东的政策是，鼓励约旦和以色列之间进行“讨论”，并寄希望于已经开创的这个进程。
