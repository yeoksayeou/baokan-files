The Guangzhou Military Region Air Force has focused on educating senior officers on economic regulations to ensure that production and business activities comply with the law. As of the end of last December, all 408 production and business projects in the region have maintained a three-year record of no major economic disputes. A new production and business format with military characteristics is beginning to take shape.

The Guangzhou Military Region Air Force is located in "Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, and Hubei," adjacent to Hong Kong, Macau, and the special economic zones. When production and business activities began to develop a few years ago, some illegal and disorderly issues arose. The Guangzhou Military Region Party Committee believes that as the military's production and business activities transition from self-sufficiency to commodity production, legal issues have significantly increased, and military leaders lack the legal qualifications to manage the economy. Therefore, they have made organizing senior officers to study economic regulations and helping them strengthen their legal awareness and capabilities in business operations a key task in the new situation. The Military Region Air Force Party Committee has invited professors from the Law Department of Sun Yat-sen University to give five lectures on economic law. The region has organized 31 economic law training sessions, training 804 senior officers, and other senior officers have also self-studied seven commonly used economic regulations as required by the Military Region Air Force. The Military Region Air Force headquarters has also organized personnel to visit all division-level and above units in the region, giving legal knowledge lectures to more than 80% of the division, brigade, and regiment-level leaders. Leaders at all levels have consciously overcome the habit of relying solely on administrative and military means to manage the economy and have paid attention to legal compliance in production and business operations.

Over the past three years, the Military Region Air Force has formulated and issued more than ten regulatory documents in this area, and various units and enterprises have formulated more than 2,000 related rules and regulations, promoting production and business operations. In the past year, the Guangzhou Military Region Air Force has conducted legal education for more than 90% of enterprise employees, including temporary workers, and issued certificates after passing the exam. After some military service societies turned to social services, some leaders promptly reminded the lower levels to handle business licenses and operate legally.

　　广空团以上干部学经济法规    
    在生产经营活动中遵守法律
    本报讯  广州军区空军从抓团以上领导干部学习经济法规入手，使生产经营活动放开手脚，全区四百零八个生产经营项目，到去年十二月底，已保持三年无重大经济纠纷。开始形成具有部队特色的生产经营新格局。
    广空部队地处“两广两湖”，毗邻港澳和经济特区。前些年开始发展生产经营时，曾发生了一些违法乱纪的问题。广空党委认为，部队生产经营正在由自给型向商品型转变，遇到的法律问题大大增多，部队的领导干部缺乏管理经济的法律素质。为此，他们把组织领导干部学习经济法规，帮助大家增强依法经营的观念和能力，作为新形势下部队建设的一项重要任务来抓。军区空军党委常委先后五次请中山大学法律系教授讲经济法律课。全区共办了三十一期经济法集训班，对八百零四名领导干部进行了集训，其他领导干部也都自学了军区空军规定的七个常用经济法规。军区空军机关还组织人员巡回到全区所有团以上单位，给百分之八十以上的军、师、团领导干部讲法律知识的辅导课。各级领导自觉克服单靠行政、军事手段管理经济的习惯，注意依法搞好生产经营。
    三年来，军区空军制定下发这方面法规性文件十多个，各部队、企业制定有关规章制度二千余项，促进了生产经营。一年来，广空部队对百分之九十以上的企业职工，包括临时工都进行了普法教育，经考试合格后颁发了结业证书。部队一些军人服务社转向社会服务以后，一些领导及时提醒下面办理营业执照；依法经营。
