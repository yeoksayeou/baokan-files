An economic plan that aligns with both the central government's overall deployment and the province's actual situation has recently been introduced in Heilongjiang.

This comprehensive plan, which prioritizes the production and supply of 383 essential commodities needed by the market, influences and oversees the entire economic layout of the province. Based on this, the provincial government has decided to strictly reduce and defer the production of goods and projects that have minimal impact on people's lives, lack raw materials, are slow to sell, consume a lot of energy, have low returns, and have no development prospects. Enterprises are classified and ranked, with some receiving strengthened support and others being shut down or merged.

This arrangement is not a simple reduction or increase of last year's plan indicators, nor is it a haphazard compilation of various interests and demands. Instead, it is based on the central government's requirements to curb inflation and strengthen effective supply. The plan was formed after extensive and in-depth investigations and rigorous scientific calculations and analyses of the province's market and the impact of each commodity in both domestic and international markets. For instance, the price department alone sent out 3,500 investigation teams to observe the market and visit residents' homes.

It is understood that during the formation of this plan, which reduces the scale of construction by 400 million yuan and cuts 90% of the new projects requested by various regions, the previous practices of sending gifts to higher-level departments, building relationships, and competing for investments and projects have been curbed. The provincial government issued a notice stating that gifts are not allowed at the planning meeting, and relationships cannot be built outside the meeting. All opinions and requests must be put on the table. Over the past one or two months, the provincial Party committee and government have strengthened ideological education through various channels, guiding cadres to establish the concept of adjusting the economic structure, strengthening macro-control, improving enterprise management, promoting effective supply, and ensuring the control of price increases. This has made the work of compressing the economy, adjusting products, and industrial structure proceed relatively smoothly. Some cities and counties originally planned to build refineries, sugar factories, and calcium carbide plants, but after macro-analysis and coordination, it was found that other regions have potential production capacity, so they voluntarily changed their plans.

For the 383 key commodities and projects that must be ensured for the entire province, considering that production, development, and supply involve many fields and departments, it is necessary for all parties to work together. To avoid the plan falling through, the provincial government treats it as a comprehensive project. Based on the situation of each city, county, and department, the overall project is broken down into several sub-projects, such as increasing supply systems, improving circulation systems, price control systems, and guarantee systems. Tasks are reasonably allocated, responsibilities are clearly defined, each plays its role, and everyone cooperates. Macroscopic supervision and control are strengthened, and the organic connection between various departments and systems is enhanced. If there is a problem in any link, the leader is held accountable. It is not allowed to do things that harm the overall interests. At the same time, it encourages various regions and departments to deepen reforms, showcase their strengths, and tap into their potential on the basis of completing the overall project's assigned tasks.

### 贯彻整顿治理方针　紧缩长线力保短线  黑龙江安排新的经济计划

　　贯彻整顿治理方针　紧缩长线力保短线    
    黑龙江安排新的经济计划
    本报讯  记者武培真报道：一个既合中央总体部署又合本省实际的经济计划，最近在黑龙江出台了。
    这个以重点保障生产和供应市场最需要的３８３种商品为导向的整体方案，牵动和总揽着全省经济布局。省政府据此又对与人民生活关系不大，或原料缺乏、市场滞销、耗能较多、效益较差、无发展前途的商品和项目，坚决压缩和从缓，对企业分类排队，或加强扶持，或关停并转。
    这个安排既不是对往年计划指标进行简单的削减或增加，也不是各方面利益和要求的大拼凑，而是根据中央关于抑制通货膨胀、加强有效供给的总要求，对全省市场和每种商品在省内外及国际市场的影响力及全省生产能力进行广泛深入调查和严密的科学测算分析之后形成的。单是物价部门深入市场观测和深入居民家庭访问的调查队就多达３５００个。
    据了解，这一将基建规模压缩４０亿元，将各地要求新上项目砍掉９／１０的方案形成期间，各地区过去那种争向上级有关部门送礼、拉关系、争投资、争项目的种种不正之风受到遏制。省政府通知，不许往计划会上带礼品，不准在会议之外开辟拉关系的“第二战场”，有何意见和要求要全部摆到桌面上。由于省委、省政府近一两个月通过多种渠道加强形势教育，引导广大干部树立调整经济结构、加强宏观调控、改善企业管理、提倡有效供给、确保抑制物价上涨的思想观念，从而使压缩空气、调整产品、产业结构的工作进展得比较顺利。有些地市县原想上炼油厂、糖厂、电石厂等项目，后经宏观分析、协调，认为其它地区有可以发挥的潜在生产能力，便主动改变计划。
    对于全省必保的３８３种重点商品和项目，考虑到生产、开发、供应涉及众多领域和部门，需要多方面通力协作，为避免使计划的落实出现落空现象，省政府将其作为一个系统工程综合考虑。根据各地市县和各部门的情况，将总工程又分解为若干子工程，如增加供给系统、改善流通系统、价格调控系统及保障系统。各项任务，合理分配，明确责任，各尽其职，互相协作，加强宏观监督调控。强化各部门、各系统之间的有机联系，哪个环节出问题，唯领导是问。不许在损害整体利益的前提下另搞一套。同时鼓励各地区各部门深化改革、各显神通，在完成总体工程分配任务的基础上，发挥自己的优势和潜力。
