The grain bureau chief thinks of the farmers

Two years ago, there was heavy rain, and last year there was a severe drought. Natural disasters affected all counties in eastern Henan, but the grain harvests varied. Xiancheng County had consecutive years of good harvests: 280 million kilograms in 1986, 400 million kilograms in 1987, and in 1988, despite seven to eight months without rain, the grain yield remained the same as the previous year.

Why did this area achieve relatively good results in grain production? The locals simply told reporters, "Growing grain is profitable, so everyone finds ways to grow it well!"

A few years ago, when we conducted interviews here, we heard a different story: "Low-priced grain, high-priced fertilizer, farming is a losing business." In 1984, there was a bumper grain harvest, but the grain bureau did not purchase all of it, and market prices were low, forcing people to find connections to sell their grain. Most people didn't have such connections, so they complained that the unfair practices were worse than natural disasters—disasters pass, but these unfair practices never end. The grain department also had its difficulties: the more grain they bought, the more they lost, but the subsidies from above were fixed, so where could they make up the losses?

Han Bingyan, who took office in 1984, spoke little but acted decisively. He visited villages and found that although farmers complained a lot, their demands were not high; as long as surplus grain was purchased at negotiated prices, their enthusiasm for growing grain would not wane. He made a quick decision: all grain bureaus in the county opened their doors day and night, buying as much grain as the farmers brought. In a short time, the county purchased 200 million kilograms of negotiated-price grain. The farmers' grain turned into cash, and their joy turned into motivation, with no decrease in their enthusiasm for growing grain.

Han Bingyan took on the farmers' burden himself, inviting a lot of gossip: "Buying so much grain, where will you store it? If it goes bad, the higher-ups will blame you, and you'll be in deep trouble." But Han was not afraid. He said, "Grain is a good thing, and the per capita grain supply is not high. I don't believe there's no one who will marry our 'daughter'!"

Han Bingyan mobilized employees to raise 10 million yuan, building 5,000 square meters of new warehouses and renovating 18 old ones. He also successfully developed slow fumigation and mechanical ventilation methods, ensuring that the grain could be stored for years without spoiling. At the same time, he sent people out to find markets. Many areas in the province had poor harvests and were desperate for grain, thanking them for "sending charcoal in snowy weather." In a short time, all the "negotiated-price grain" was sold, netting a profit of over 100 million yuan.

With profits from growing grain, there was no lack of motivation. In 1987, Xiancheng County suffered a disaster but had a bumper harvest. Although the wheat season had both rain and dry winds, reducing the yield by 20%, the total grain production for the year was still 42% more than in 1986. The grain system's employees continued their efforts, opening up grain purchases again. This year was different. In a disaster year, grain was like gold. Some people saw that Xiancheng County had a lot of grain and saw an opportunity to make money, forming various individual and collective "grain and oil companies." Some even set up purchasing points at the grain bureau's door, raising prices to attract farmers, creating a scene like a "grain war."

Some people couldn't stand it anymore and suggested administrative intervention, ordering farmers to sell their grain to the grain bureau. Han Bingyan, however, shook his head in disagreement: "Administrative orders do not align with the policy of activating the economy, and in reality, they cannot be enforced. Why can't our state-owned grain bureaus compete with them?!" He mobilized all grain bureaus to use their advantages of having more people and vehicles to purchase 1,000 tons of fertilizer from outside the county, exchanging it for grain; to facilitate the farmers, the county sent people to the farmers' homes to inspect and grade the grain, ensuring fair transactions. These two moves quickly changed the "battlefield," with 80% of the grain outside the quota delivered to the grain bureau, totaling 750 million kilograms of grain purchased that year. They sold the grain to 26 provinces and cities and also processed it into flour and feed. That year, they made a profit of over 200 million yuan.

With the farmers' enthusiasm for growing grain, the grain bureau's ability to purchase and sell grain also improved. In 1988, Xiancheng County experienced a once-in-a-century drought, but the grain yield was still close to that of 1987. That year, they took two major steps in grain work: first, building a flour mill-oil mill-feed mill integrated processing plant to comprehensively utilize grain, turning bran and cake into feed, increasing the value of grain; second, breaking into the international market, selling soybean meal and other grain products to six countries around the world.

　　粮食局长想着种粮人
    段心强　赵明　吴宪岭
    前年阴雨，去年大旱，自然灾害不分薄厚地危及豫东各县，可是各县粮食收成却有丰有歉。项城县粮食连年丰收：１９８６年产量２．８亿公斤，１９８７年４亿公斤，１９８８年七八个月没雨，粮食产量仍与上年持平。
    为什么这里的粮食生产取得较好成绩？老百姓在记者采访时回答得很简单：“种粮食有利，大伙就想法子种好呗！”
    几年前在这里采访，我们听到的可是另一番话：“低价粮，高价肥，种庄稼，活吃亏。”１９８４年粮食大丰收，粮管所不包购，市场粮价压得很低，逼着老百姓托人走“后门”卖粮。多数人没“后门”，便埋怨不正之风比自然灾害还厉害——灾害虽大，过去就完，可这不正之风却没完没了。粮食部门也有粮食部门的难处，收粮越多赔得越多，可上边的补贴是个死数，多赔了从哪里出？
    １９８４年上任的粮食局长韩炳炎，说话不多，办事却实实在在。他走访乡里，发现庄稼人怨声虽大，要求却不高，只要余粮按议价收购，种粮的积极性就不会减。他当机立断：全县一二十个粮所敞开大门，日夜办公，卖粮的有多少，就收多少。不长时间，全县收购２０００万公斤议价粮。庄稼人手中的粮食变成大把钞票，喜悦变成干劲，种粮积极性一点儿不减。
    韩炳炎把庄稼人的包袱接来自己背，惹出不少闲话：“收这么多粮食，哪有地方存放？一旦发霉变质，上边怪罪下来，叫姓韩的吃不了兜着走。”可老韩不怕。他说：“粮食是好东西，全国人均占有量又不多，我不信有闺女嫁不出去！”
    韩炳炎发动职工自筹资金１００万元，新建５０００平方米仓库，改造１８处老库房，又研制成功缓式熏蒸和机械通风法，保证粮食存放几年也不会坏。同时把人撒出去，找销路，全省一些歉收的地方正求粮不得，感谢他们“雪中送炭”。不长时间，“议价粮”全部出手，净赚上百万元。
    种粮有赚头，何愁无干劲。１９８７年项城县遭了灾，却迎来了丰收年。尽管麦季先是阴雨，后是干热风，小麦减产二成，全年粮食总产还是比１９８６年增加４２％还多。粮食系统的职工再接再厉，又一次敞开收粮。这一年不同往常。灾年粮如金。一些人看到项城县的粮食多，有油水可捞，便组成各种个体、集体“粮油公司”，有的竟把收购点设在粮所门口，抬高价格吸引农民，俨然是一场“粮食大战”的架势。农民纷纷卖粮给集体和个体“公司”。
    有人沉不住气了，主张行政干预，命令农民一律交粮给粮所。韩炳炎却摇头反对：“行政命令的办法不符合搞活的政策，实际上也限制不住。我们国营粮所为什么就竞争不过他们？！”他发动各粮所利用自己人多、车多的优势，从外地购进化肥１０００多吨，以肥换粮；为了方便庄稼人，县里派人到农户验收定级，公平交易。这两“招”一下子改变了“战局”，定购任务之外８０％的粮食交到了粮所，全年收粮７５００万公斤。他们把粮食销往２６个省市，同时搞深加工，加工面粉、饲料。这年获利润２００多万元。
    有了农民种植粮食的积极性，粮所购销粮食的能力也提高了。１９８８年项城遇到百年没有的大旱，但粮食产量仍接近１９８７年。这一年他们在粮食工作上又迈出两大步：一是建设面粉厂——油厂——饲料厂联合加工，综合利用，把麦麸、饼粕加工成饲料，使粮食增值；二是冲出国门，把豆粕等粮食产品销往世界六个国家……
