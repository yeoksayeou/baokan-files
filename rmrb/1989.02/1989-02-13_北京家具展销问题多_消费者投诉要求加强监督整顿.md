The Beijing Daily reported on February 13th that recently, the Beijing Consumer Association received a complaint letter from Xu Huasheng of Xidan Department Store. The letter stated: Last year, the Beijing Huaxia Industrial and Commercial Company and the Beijing Longhua Trading Company jointly held a furniture exhibition and sale at the Beijing Exhibition Hall. I saw a set of combination cabinets produced by the Dafang Furniture Factory in Haidian District, which had a good appearance and craftsmanship, so I paid 1,780 yuan to order one. A month later, one evening, the factory delivered the combination cabinet. After moving it into the house, I found that one of the wardrobe doors could not be closed. The delivery person said they would send someone to fix it the next day. The next day, I carefully examined the purchased combination cabinet and was shocked to find that the paint had peeled off in many places, the glass was broken, and even one of the cabinet doors had a broken corner. I quickly called the factory, but it turned out to be a residential building with no such people or factory, revealing a scam. Similar complaints are received by the Beijing Consumer Association almost every day. They received 314 complaint letters in 1988, with 57 alone in December. Since the beginning of 1989, user feedback has been even stronger, with complaints increasing. Some reflect that certain manufacturers use order fairs to deceive, cheat, and swindle, while others reflect delayed delivery dates, significant differences between samples and actual products, and poor quality.

It is understood that in 1988, Beijing held over 120 furniture exhibitions and sales, with nearly 40 organizing units. It must be acknowledged that holding these furniture exhibitions and sales has played a certain positive role in activating the market and convenience for the public. However, the chaotic situation in furniture exhibitions and sales has caused strong dissatisfaction among consumers. Some cultural troupes, environmental protection units, and electrical sales companies, in order to make money, also organize furniture exhibitions and sales. They rent a venue and then sublet it to manufacturing factories at several times the rental price, profiting from the middle. These organizing units do not conduct any examination of the exhibitors' qualifications—factory facilities, technical processes, product quality, etc. As long as the exhibitors pay to participate, they are allowed in. Thus, some manufacturers and individual businesses that do not have the conditions to produce furniture take advantage of this, using various improper means to deceive customers, producing shoddy products, evading taxes, and in the worst cases, running away after collecting customers' deposits.

There is a true piece of news: A young couple bought a spring bed from a furniture factory, and it collapsed on their wedding night. Strangely, when the user went to the organizing unit to demand a solution, they remained silent. No wonder some consumers angrily say: The furniture exhibition and sale has become a "scam fair."

Of course, it is not fair to generalize. The furniture exhibition and sale organized by the Beijing Furniture Company is very responsible. They implement "four unifications": unified examination of exhibitors' qualifications, unified quality standards and prices, unified sales methods, and unified after-sales service. They also invite the Beijing Consumer Association to supervise and manage, ensuring that quality issues are addressed, contract violations can be compensated, effectively guaranteeing the quality of exhibited furniture, protecting consumers' interests, and preventing exhibitors from evading taxes, thus protecting national interests. Their business methods have gained the trust of users. Last year, the furniture sales volume reached over 80 million yuan, accounting for 1/3 of Beijing's total furniture sales. Consumers hope that relevant departments will further strengthen the supervision and management of the furniture market.

### 北京家具展销问题多  消费者投诉要求加强监督整顿

　　北京家具展销问题多    
    消费者投诉要求加强监督整顿
    本报讯  据１３日出版的市场报报道：不久前，北京市消费者协会收到西单百货商场邬华生一封投诉信。信中说：去年北京华夏工商实业公司、北京龙华贸易公司在北京展览馆联合举办了一次家具展销。我看到海淀区大方木器厂生产的组合柜样子和做工都不错，花了１７８０元定了一套。一个月后的一天晚上，厂家把组合柜送来了，搬到屋里，发现一扇大衣柜门关不上。送货人表示第二天就派人来修好。第二天，我仔细看了一下买来的组合柜，不觉大吃一惊，发现漆皮多处脱落，玻璃破裂，甚至还有一框门断了一只角。我赶紧给工厂打电话，谁知，这是一幢民房，既没有这两个人，也没有这个厂，原来是个骗局。”类似这种投诉，北京市消费者协会几乎天天收到，他们１９８８年共收到３１４件投诉信，其中去年１２月份就有５７件。进入１９８９年以来，用户反应更加强烈，投诉者有增无减。有的反映某些厂家利用定货会搞坑蒙拐骗，有的反映交货日期一拖再拖，有的反映样品与实物差距太大，质量低劣……
    据了解，１９８８年，北京市举办各种家具展销１２０多次，主办单位近４０家。应该承认，举办这些家具展销会，对搞活市场，方便群众起了一定的积极作用。但是，家具展销的混乱现象，已引起广大消费者的强烈不满。有的文艺团体、有的环保单位、有的机电销售公司，为了赚钱，也办家具展销。他们租一场地，尔后再以租金若干倍的价格转租给生产厂家，从中渔利。这些举办单位对参展者资格——厂房设备、技术工艺、产品质量等，不进行任何审查，只要参展交钱就行。于是，一些不具备生产家具条件的厂家和个体户，乘虚而入，采用各种不正当手段欺骗顾客，产品粗制滥造，偷税漏税，更有甚者，骗取用户定金后便溜之大吉。
    有这样一条千真万确的消息：一对青年男女在某家具厂买了一张席梦思床，新婚之夜就睡塌了。奇怪的是，当用户找到主办单位要求解决问题时，他们竟不闻不问。难怪有些消费者气愤地说：家具展销会变成了“坑人会”。
    当然，也不能一概而论。北京市家具公司组织的家具展销就很负责任，他们实行“四统一”，即：统一审定参展者资格，统一质量标准和价格，统一销售办法，统一售后服务，并请北京市消费者协会进行监督管理，做到出了质量问题有人管，违反合同可索赔，既有效地保证了参展家具的质量，维护了消费者的利益，又防止了参展单位偷税漏税，保护了国家利益。他们的经营方法，得到了用户的信任。去年家具销售额达８０００多万元，占北京市家具销售总额的１／３。消费者希望有关部门进一步强化对家具市场监督管理。　　　　　　（万贵生）
