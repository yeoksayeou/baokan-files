A minority of villagers from Tuanjie Village in Wansheng Township, Nantong Mining District, Chongqing, have been obstructing the construction of the Wansheng to Nanchuan railway, a key national project. As a result, the 2.6-kilometer railway line passing through Tuanjie Village has not been able to proceed with normal construction, seriously affecting the completion deadline of the Wan-Nan railway and causing significant economic losses to the construction unit.

On March 18, 1988, the Fifth Division of the Eleventh Bureau of the Ministry of Railways entered the site to begin construction as per the requirements of the Nanchuan Local Railway Engineering Command. A minority of villagers from Tuanjie seized the construction workers' tools and prevented machinery and vehicles from entering the construction site. On April 26, some villagers attacked and verbally abused the workers, broke into the workers' living quarters, damaging doors, windows, and glass, and raided the canteen to steal food. The disturbance lasted over 10 hours, with thousands of onlookers and hecklers. Six workers were injured on the spot, and two were hospitalized.

Following the incident, the Nantong Mining District Public Security Bureau and the Southwest Railway Public Security Bureau conducted investigations. The Chongqing Municipal Government also sent a letter to Nantong Mining District instructing them to handle the matter seriously. However, to this day, the problem remains unresolved. Within the 2.6-kilometer railway line in Tuanjie Village, 14 households are still blocking the way, and 46 graves have not been relocated. According to the construction unit, in 1988 alone, the construction unit lost 71,795 man-hours of work and incurred economic losses of over 810,000 yuan. They expressed their concern, asking, "What if this situation continues indefinitely? Who will be held responsible?"

　　团结村村民阻挠铁路施工
    重庆市南桐矿区万盛乡团结村的少数村民，阻挠国家重点建设项目万盛至南川铁路施工，致使经团结村的２．６公里铁路线至今不能正常施工，严重影响了万南铁路的竣工期限，给施工单位带来了巨大的经济损失。
    １９８８年３月１８日，铁道部十一局五处根据南川地方铁路工程指挥部的要求进入现场施工时，团结村的少数村民上前抢夺施工人员的工具，阻止机械、车辆进入施工现场，４月２６日，一些村民到施工现场殴打、辱骂工人，冲进施工人员住地打坏门窗、玻璃，到职工食堂抢饭吃，闹事持续１０多个小时，围观、起哄达千余人。这次有６名工人当场被打伤，２人住进了医院。
    事件发生后，南桐矿区公安局、西南铁路公安处等单位作了调查，重庆市人民政府也函告南桐矿区要认真处理，但时至今日，问题并没解决。团结村境内的２．６公里铁路线上，仍有１４户人家挡道，４６座坟墓尚未迁出。据施工单位统计，１９８８年内，施工单位共误工时７１７９５个，经济损失达８１万多元。他们反映，长期这样拖下去，怎么办？责任由谁来负？ 　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　湖北襄樊市铁十一局　郑宣
