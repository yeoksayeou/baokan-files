	Relying on Technological Progress to Optimize Product Structure
	Suzhou Strides Towards a Modern Industrial City

	According to a report by our reporter Zhang Guorong: With a population of just over 5 million, Suzhou City has united in developing productive forces, and in 1988, the city's industrial output value surged to 39.216 billion yuan, ranking fourth among large and medium-sized cities nationwide, following Shanghai, Beijing, and Tianjin. The city realized a profit and tax revenue of 3.02 billion yuan. The output value and profit and tax revenue increased by 33.3% and 36.8% respectively compared to the previous year. Over the past decade of reform, the city's annual growth rates for output value and profit and tax revenue have been 24.2% and 14.1% respectively. Some people consider this a miracle in China's economic development.

	Over the past 10 years, Suzhou City has developed more than 6,430 new products, almost averaging two new products per day. Not only are there many new products, but they also have a relatively high starting point and a certain competitiveness in domestic and international markets. According to incomplete statistics, among these products, there are more than 340 that fill domestic gaps and more than 750 that fill provincial gaps. A total of 245 products have won national or ministry/provincial excellent new product awards.

	Famous and new products have become the backbone of Suzhou's industrial economy. Last year, the output value of famous and new products in the city reached 6.35 billion yuan, accounting for 1/5 of the city's total industrial output value of 28.8 billion yuan. Optimizing the product structure has promoted the development of the city's export-oriented economy. Last year, the city's foreign trade procurement amounted to 3.388 billion yuan, an increase of 70.5% compared to the previous year, ranking first in the province. Among these, the output value of famous and new products exceeded 2 billion yuan.

　　依靠科技进步　优化产品结构
　　苏州向现代工业城市大步迈进
    本报讯  记者张国荣报道：仅有５００多万人口的苏州市，上下同心同德大力发展社会生产力，１９８８年工业总产值一跃达到３９２．１６亿元，列沪、京、津之后，在全国大中城市中名列第４；实现利税３０．２亿元。产值、利税分别比上年增长３３．３％和３６．８％。改革１０年来，全市产值、利税年递增率分别达到２４．２％和１４．１％，有人认为这是中国经济发展中的一个奇迹。
    １０年来，苏州市共开发新产品６４３０多个，几乎平均每天有２个新产品问世，不仅数量多，而且起点比较高，在国内外市场有一定的竞争力。据不完全统计，这些产品中填补国内空白的新产品有３４０多个，填补省内空白的有７５０多个；先后获得国家或部（省）优秀新产品奖的有２４５个。
    名优新产品已成为苏州市工业经济的中坚力量。去年全市名优新产品产值已达６３．５亿元，占全市乡以上工业总产值２８８亿元的１／５强。优化产品结构促进了全市外向型经济的发展。去年全市外贸收购额３３．８８亿元，比上年增长７０．５％，名列全省第一。其中名优新产品产值超过２０亿元。
