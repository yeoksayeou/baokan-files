On October 24, 1988, the Cangzhou City Administration for Industry and Commerce and the Cangzhou Branch of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange received a letter from the public exposing that someone in Cangzhou City, in collusion with several companies in Shijiazhuang and Nanjing, illegally used foreign exchange to purchase 1,000 units of 47-inch "Panda" brand color TVs from the Nanjing Radio Factory. The first batch of 500 units had already been shipped to Cangzhou. Subsequently, on November 3, the second batch of TVs arrived in Cangzhou. The recipients acted secretly and quickly sold most of the TVs.

How did these 1,000 TVs end up being smuggled?

	Collusion for Mutual Gain

In July 1988, the Huafa Garment and Leather Products Limited Company (hereinafter referred to as Huafa Company), a joint venture under the Huabei Petroleum Administration Bureau's Exploration Company No. 2, needed a batch of imported fabrics for garment processing. The company's business representative, Ma Xiaolin, was tasked with arranging this. Ma then contacted Guo Xiaodong, an acquaintance, who in turn connected with the wholesale department of the Shijiazhuang Overseas Chinese Friendship Supply Company (hereinafter referred to as the Overseas Chinese Company). On July 5, Huafa Company and the Overseas Chinese Company signed an agreement stating that the Overseas Chinese Company would use Huafa Company's foreign exchange to purchase 1,000 TVs, and repay with imported fabrics of equal value. However, Huafa Company was unwilling to bear the risk of funding, so Ma and Guo approached the Shijiazhuang Limin Industrial Stock Company (hereinafter referred to as Limin Company), which saw an opportunity for profit and agreed to fund the purchase of 1,000 TVs. Ma and Guo immediately went to Nanjing and on July 26, signed an agreement with the Nanjing Radio Factory for Huafa Company to purchase 1,000 units of 47-inch "Panda" brand color TVs for $395,000. Although Limin Company did not have the business of selling TVs, on August 2, it applied to the Shijiazhuang Nansan Road Credit Union for a loan of 2.5 million yuan, citing "purchasing 'Panda' TVs, insufficient funds." The credit union surprisingly approved the loan. Meanwhile, Ma and Guo applied to the Hebei Branch of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange for an adjustment of foreign exchange quotas (i.e., foreign exchange indicators) for "purchasing fabrics and auxiliary materials." After approval, Limin Company funded Huafa Company 1.17 million yuan to purchase $450,000 in foreign exchange. Huafa Company planned to convert the foreign exchange quota into cash and transfer $395,000 to Nanjing, but due to lack of necessary proof, the request was not approved.

Ma Xiaolin and Guo Xiaodong failed in their provincial efforts and then turned to the Cangzhou Branch of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange. They visited the home of the branch's deputy director, Shi Zonglun, asking for his help. Shi Zonglun clearly stated that according to relevant regulations of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, it is not permitted to use adjusted foreign exchange to purchase market goods, and advised them not to pursue the matter further.

This attempt to smuggle TVs was thwarted, and later, Huafa Company transferred the $450,000 in adjusted foreign exchange to Hong Kong to purchase fabric materials.

	Covert Operations

However, Ma Xiaolin did not forget about purchasing the TVs. Knowing that Huafa Company could not directly remit foreign exchange to the Nanjing Radio Factory to purchase TVs, he devised a plan. He went south again, through a responsible person at the Nanjing Xiyang District Economic Commission, and found the Nanjing Sanfu Fashion Limited Company (hereinafter referred to as Sanfu Company), requesting to borrow this company's foreign exchange account. To deceive the foreign exchange management department, on August 18, Ma Xiaolin signed a false contract with Sanfu Company, stating that Sanfu Company would supply Huafa Company with $395,000 worth of fabric materials and auxiliary materials. Then, Huafa Company directly commissioned the Hebei Branch of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange to handle the foreign exchange adjustment procedures. After approval, Limin Company funded Huafa Company 2.54 million yuan to purchase $395,000. At the same time, Limin Company separately signed a contract with the Overseas Chinese Company, agreeing to supply the Overseas Chinese Company with 600 TVs, each priced at 2,790 yuan, and received a prepayment of 1.2 million yuan.

In early September, Shi Zonglun of the Cangzhou Branch of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange learned that Huafa Company had adjusted $395,000 in foreign exchange and suspected that Huafa Company was still planning to purchase TVs. He reported this situation to several directors of the Hebei Branch, but the Hebei Branch took no action.

On September 22, despite the absence of Huafa Company's seal on the payment voucher, the Bank of China Shijiazhuang Branch remitted Huafa Company's $395,000 to the account of the Nanjing Sanfu Company. Through the efforts of a responsible person at the Nanjing Xiyang District Economic Commission, on September 26, the Nanjing Branch of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange approved Sanfu Company to transfer $395,000 in cash to the Nanjing Radio Factory, "limited to the import of key components for TVs."

In October, Ma Xiaolin, Guo Xiaodong, and others, armed with a letter from Huafa Company stating that the TVs were purchased for the welfare of employees and not for resale, withdrew 1,000 TVs (each priced at 2,540 yuan) from the Nanjing Radio Factory.

This batch of TVs was shipped to Cangzhou, where several companies were in the process of dividing and selling them when they were seized by the Cangzhou City Administration for Industry and Commerce.

	Loose Management, Severe Lessons

Huafa Company, in order to obtain fabric materials, colluded with Limin Company to use deceptive means, alter the purpose of foreign exchange, and engage in speculative activities, disrupting national finance. Limin Company invested hundreds of millions of yuan, using Huafa Company's adjusted foreign exchange to purchase TVs and planning to resell them at a profit. Although the activities were halted after the incident, illegal acts had already been committed. Relevant departments will take action against these two companies.

However, during the second attempt by these companies to smuggle TVs, from Cangzhou to Shijiazhuang and then to Nanjing, from using loans in yuan to purchase adjusted foreign exchange to cross-provincial transfers to purchase TVs, they encountered almost no obstacles. The "speculators" had such great influence due to the negligence, indulgence, and even collusion of some units and management departments. Afterwards, whether it was the director of the Shijiazhuang Nansan Road City Credit Union crying and regretting, or the Bank of China Shijiazhuang Branch repeatedly calling and sending people to Cangzhou Huafa Company to request the addition of seals, it was all too late. If strict controls had been in place from the beginning, could the incident have been prevented? Moreover, after the Hebei Branch of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange learned that Huafa Company might use foreign exchange to purchase TVs, they did not conduct further investigations. The Nanjing Sanfu Company participated in signing false contracts and lending foreign exchange accounts, and so on. These units and relevant personnel should not these incidents cause them to reflect? Should they not be held accountable?

　　１０００台彩电倒腾记
    本报记者  罗华
    １９８８年１０月２４日，河北沧州市工商行政管理局和国家外汇管理局沧州分局分别收到一封群众来信，揭发沧州市有人伙同石家庄、南京的几家公司，非法用外汇从南京无线电厂买出１０００台熊猫牌４７厘米彩电，第一批５００台已运到沧州。接着，１１月３日，第二批彩电运到了沧州。接货人行动诡秘，很快便将大部分彩电脱手。
    这１０００台彩电是怎么倒腾来的呢？
    　　　　互相勾结　各图其利
    １９８８年７月，华北石油管理局勘探二公司下属的合资企业华发服装皮革制品有限公司（以下简称华发公司）加工服装需要一批进口面料，让公司业务员马晓林联系。马又通过熟人郭晓东与石家庄华侨友谊供应公司（以下简称华侨公司）批发部联系。７月５日，华发公司与华侨公司签订了一份协议书，写明华侨公司使用华发公司外汇，购进１０００台彩电，以同等价值的进口面料付还。但华发公司又不愿出钱担风险，马、郭２人就找到石家庄利民实业股份有限公司（以下简称利民公司），利民公司想从中渔利，表示愿出资做１０００台彩电的生意。马、郭２人立即去南京，于７月２６日与南京无线电厂签订了一份华发公司以３９．５万美元购买１０００台熊猫牌４７厘米彩电的协议书。利民公司本没有经营彩电的业务，但在８月２日，却向石家庄市南三条信用社申请贷款２５０万元人民币，理由是“购‘熊猫’彩电，资金不足”。南三条信用社竟然批准了。同时，马、郭２人向国家外汇管理局河北分局申请调剂外汇额度（即外汇指标），用于“购面料、辅料”。经批准后，利民公司为华发公司出资１１７万元，买入４５万美元的外汇额度。华发公司准备将外汇额度买成现汇，把其中的３９．５万美元汇往南京，由于缺乏必要的证明，没有被批准。
    马晓林和郭晓东在省里没有办成，又打国家外汇管理局沧州分局的主意。他们找到沧州分局副主任石宗伦家里，请石宗伦帮忙。石宗伦明确表示，根据国家外汇管理的有关规定，不得用调剂外汇购买市场物资，劝他们不要再搞此事。
    这次倒腾彩电的活动告吹了，后来，华发公司把这次调剂的４５万美元转入香港，买了服装面料。
    　　　　明修栈道　暗渡陈仓
    但是，马晓林对购买彩电一事并未忘怀。他知道华发公司不能直接向南京无线电厂汇外汇购买彩电，便多长了一个心眼。他又一次南下，通过南京市栖霞区经委一负责人，找到南京市三福时装有限公司（以下简称三福公司），请求借用这家公司的外汇帐户。为了欺骗外汇管理部门，８月１８日，马晓林与三福公司签订了一份假合同，写明由三福公司供给华发公司价值３９．５万美元的服装面料和辅料。然后，华发公司直接委托国家外汇管理局河北分局办理调剂外汇手续。经批准，利民公司为华发公司出资２５４万元，买入３９．５万美元。同时，利民公司单独与华侨公司签定了一份合同，由利民公司供给华侨公司６００台彩电，每台价格２７９０元，并收取１２０万元预付款。
    ９月初，国家外汇管理局沧州分局的石宗伦得知华发公司又调剂了３９．５万美元外汇，怀疑华发公司仍想购彩电，便把这个情况向河北分局的几位处长作了汇报。但是，河北分局并无动作。
    ９月２２日，在支款凭证上缺少华发公司印鉴的情况下，中国银行石家庄分行就把华发公司的３９．５万美元汇入南京三福公司的帐户。经南京栖霞区经委那位负责人奔走活动，９月２６日国家外汇管理局南京分局批准三福公司将３９．５万美元现汇调剂给南京无线电厂，“限用于进口彩电关键件”。
    １０月，马晓林、郭晓东等人拿着华发公司开的买彩电给本单位职工谋福利、不经营倒卖的证明信，从南京无线电厂提出了１０００台彩电（每台价格折合人民币２５４０元）。
    这批彩电运到沧州，几家公司正进行瓜分和倒卖时，被沧州市工商局查扣了一部分。
    　　　　管理不严　教训深刻
    华发公司为了得到服装面料，竟与利民公司串通一气，采取欺骗手段，改变外汇用途，大搞投机倒把活动，扰乱国家金融；而利民公司出资数百万元，利用华发公司调剂外汇套购彩电，并计划加价倒卖，虽然案发后中止活动，但已形成违法事实。有关部门将对这两家公司作出处理。
    然而，在这几家公司第二次倒腾彩电过程中，从沧州到石家庄再到南京，从用贷款人民币购买调剂外汇到跨省划拨买出彩电，几乎一路“绿灯”。几个“倒爷”之所以有这么大的能量，与我们一些单位及管理部门失察、姑息甚至纵容有关。事后，不管是石家庄市南三条城市信用社主任哭哭啼啼、追悔莫及；还是中国银行石家庄分行三番五次打电话、派人去沧州华发公司要求补盖印鉴，都于事无补。如果当初严格把关，是不是可以防患于未然呢？还有，国家外汇管理局河北分局得知华发公司可能要用外汇买彩电的情况后，却未做进一步调查；南京三福公司参与签订假合同、出借外汇帐户，等等，这些单位和有关人员难道不应该引起反省吗？难道不应该追究他们的责任吗？
