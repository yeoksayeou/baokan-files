Preamble

Hong Kong has been part of China since ancient times. After the Opium War in 1840, it was occupied by Britain. On December 19, 1984, the governments of China and Britain signed the Joint Declaration on the Question of Hong Kong, confirming that the Government of the People's Republic of China would resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1, 1997, thereby realizing the long-cherished desire of the Chinese people to recover Hong Kong.

To safeguard national unity and territorial integrity, maintain Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, and in consideration of Hong Kong's historical and actual situation, the state has decided that upon the resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong, in accordance with Article 31 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall be established, and the policy of "one country, two systems" shall be implemented, without applying the socialist system and policies to Hong Kong. The basic policies of the state toward Hong Kong have been elaborated by the Government of China in the Sino-British Joint Declaration.

In accordance with the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, the National People's Congress hereby enacts the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China, which stipulates the systems to be practiced in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, so as to ensure the implementation of the basic policies of the state toward Hong Kong.

    香港自古以来就是中国的领土，1840年鸦片战争以后被英国占领。1984年12月19日，中英两国政府签署了关于香港问题的联合声明，确认中华人民共和国政府于1997年7月1日恢复对香港行使主权，从而实现了长期以来中国人民收回香港的共同愿望。
    为了维护国家的统一和领土完整，保持香港的繁荣和稳定，并考虑到香港的历史和现实情况，国家决定，在对香港恢复行使主权时，根据中华人民共和国宪法第三十一条的规定，设立香港特别行政区，并按照“一个国家，两种制度”的方针，不在香港实行社会主义的制度和政策。国家对香港的基本方针政策，已由我国政府在中英联合声明中予以阐明。
