Comrade Tan Zheng has passed away. He lay on his sickbed for several years, unable to speak, and left no final words. However, his more than 60 years of revolutionary actions and numerous works have left behind a precious legacy for the people.

As a member of the Central Committee Secretariat and Director of the General Political Department of the PLA in the 1950s, his achievements in party work, especially in military political work, are well-known. Who among those who know him can fail to remember him?

Comrade Tan Zheng was a person who insisted on seeking truth from facts and upholding the truth.

In 1956, the Eighth National Congress of the Party correctly concluded that the principal contradiction in China was between the people's need for rapid economic and cultural development and the inability of the economy and culture to meet these needs, and that the principal task was to develop the productive forces. However, starting in September 1957, this conclusion was incorrectly changed to focus on the "struggle between two classes and two lines." I recall that in the spring of 1960, Comrade Tan Zheng, together with leaders such as Su Yu, Wang Ping, Xu Guangda, and Zhang Jingwu, was studying and discussing political economy in Nanjing. In his speech, he expressed doubts and confusion about this change. His spirit of seeking truth from facts and upholding the truth surprised us who were present at the time.

During the "Great Leap Forward" in 1958, when inspecting some units and military academies' "small blast furnaces," he always asked detailed questions about the sources of raw materials, product quality, and economic accounting, warning everyone to be careful not to do things that are "not worth the effort."

During the implementation of some "leftist" political movements in the army, he was often seen as "slow-witted" and even repeatedly criticized for being "inactive."

After the Lushan Conference, during the expanded meeting of the Military Commission to criticize Comrade Peng Dehuai, he did not speak a word. At the first meeting convened by Lin Biao after he took office to deploy military work, when giving a report, he did not follow the "custom" of expressing support for the newly appointed leader in such a situation and did not say a single word of praise for Lin Biao.

When deploying the army's "struggle against right opportunism," he drafted a notice from the General Political Department, stating that the main target of the struggle should be enemy elements that sabotage socialism, and that education should be emphasized for others.

In the spring of 1960, when the business department reported to him that they disagreed with the publication of an article in a magazine that praised an individual with words like "genius," "commander," and "following Comrade Lin," he nodded, and the article was not published that year.

When Lin Biao separated Mao Zedong Thought from Marxism and attempted to abolish the study of Marxist theory, he loudly advocated that "theory must still be systematically studied" and promoted the formulation of outlines for three courses in military academies: philosophy, political economy, and the history of the Chinese Communist Party.

Starting from the new stage of the army's construction, Tan Zheng insisted that without culture, there would be no modernization of the army. In early 1959, he presided over the formulation of a ten-year plan to popularize middle and higher education among all military cadres. The plan was presented to Comrade Mao Zedong in Guangzhou and, after being reviewed and approved by the Military Commission, was issued. The entire army launched a vigorous cultural advancement campaign. Many old comrades still remember the effective implementation of this cultural advancement campaign for two years and regret that it was interrupted by Lin Biao.

Although Tan Zheng's actions at the time did not intend to oppose Lin Biao personally, he dared to insist on seeking truth from facts, dared to uphold the truth he recognized, and dared to not compromise principles for the revolution. Although Lin Biao still hypocritically said at the January 1960 Central Shanghai Conference that the political work was good and he was at ease, he soon began to pick faults and attack. By October, he announced that the political work led by Tan Zheng had "deviated." He accused Tan Zheng of being "not in harmony" and "not cooperative" with him, and of being "unmoved by thunder." Subsequently, someone criticized Tan Zheng for not "raising" the "red flag of Mao Zedong Thought," but rather "carrying" it; then it escalated to "opposing Mao Zedong Thought" and resisting the "highly raised red flag" of "Comrade Vice Chairman Lin." He was also falsely accused of "implementing the Peng-Huang line" with four department heads of the General Political Department to form an "anti-party clique." During the "Cultural Revolution," he was naturally not spared, taken to Beijing, and made to "struggle" alongside Peng Dehuai. This old warrior of the Autumn Harvest Uprising in the Xianggan Border in 1927 was imprisoned for 8 years during the "Cultural Revolution" and was only rehabilitated after the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee. However, by then, Tan Zheng was already physically and mentally exhausted, plagued by illness, and after several years of being bedridden, he finally took his last breath.

Comrade Tan Zheng's integrity and selflessness are also admirable.

During his tenure as the Director of the General Political Department, I often accompanied him to the Northeast, East China, South China, and Central South regions to investigate and hold meetings with the troops. He never indulged in sightseeing; when he went to Moscow, the cameras and binoculars given to him by the Soviet side were handed over to the office for use upon his return; when he visited factories, the leaders would quietly place a small amount of products in the car as a memento, but he would discover them and return them, sometimes sending them back three times, insisting on not accepting; he had not returned to his hometown for decades, and when he visited his hometown, the villagers were very happy. Upon leaving, they gave him some local food, just a few packs of tea, a few pounds of cured meat, and a few pieces of rice cake. He repeatedly declined but eventually had his secretary pay for it. Later, he checked and found that the money paid was too little, so he paid again until the secretary showed him the receipt from the villagers, and only then did he feel happy.

Comrade Tan Zheng's revolutionary life was mainly dedicated to military political work. He can be called a master of political work.

Tan Zheng's "Report on Military Political Work at the High-Level Meeting of the Northwest Bureau," written under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong in 1944, is a significant historical document in the party's political work after the Guanding Resolution. However, after Tan Zheng was criticized, this report was ordered by Lin Biao to change its title, remove Tan Zheng's name, and be shelved. It was not until 1983 that it was approved by the Central Military Commission to restore its original form and reprint. Today, when we urgently need to strengthen and improve political work, we cannot help but think of it.

Rest in peace, Comrade Tan Zheng. People will not forget you!

### 谭政同志，人们不会忘记你！

　　谭政同志，人们不会忘记你！
    姜思毅
    谭政同志去世了。他躺在病床几年口不能言，临终也未能留下什么话。可是他６０余年的革命行为和大量论著，给人们留下了宝贵的遗产。
    作为５０年代的党中央书记处书记、解放军总政治部主任，他在党的工作方面，特别是在军队政治工作方面的业绩，是有目共睹的。凡是知道的，谁能不怀念他？
    谭政同志是一个坚持实事求是、坚持真理的人。
    １９５６年，党的“八大”做出了国内的主要矛盾是人民对于经济文化迅速发展的需要同经济文化不能满足人民需要的状况之间的矛盾，主要任务是发展社会生产力的正确论断。可是从１９５７年９月开始，又错误地改变了“八大”的提法，把“两个阶级、两条道路的斗争”当做主要矛盾。记得１９６０年春天，谭政同志在南京和粟裕、王平、许光达、张经武等领导同志一起读书，研讨政治经济学时，在发言中对于这种改变仍然表示疑惑不解。他这种实事求是、坚持真理的精神，使当时在座的我们为之一惊。
    在１９５８年“大跃进”中，他在考察一些部队和军事院校的“小高炉”中，总是详细询问原料来源、产品质量和经济核算等问题，告诫大家注意不要干“得不偿失”的事。
    在部队奉命开展一些“左”的政治运动时，他常常被视为“思想迟钝”，甚至一再被斥为“按兵不动”。
    庐山会议后，在批判彭德怀同志的军委扩大会上，他一言未发。在林彪上台后首次召开的部署军队工作的会议上，他在作报告时，不顾在这种场合下常有对刚接任的领导要表态拥护的“惯例”，竟然没对林彪说一句赞颂之词。
    在部署部队“反对右倾机会主义斗争”时，他起草一个总政通知，指明斗争的主要对象应是破坏社会主义的敌对分子，对其他人都重在教育。
    １９６０年春，当业务部门向他汇报，不同意一篇以“天才”、“统帅”、“跟着林总走”等词吹捧个人的《东北战场上的林彪同志》一文在刊物上发表时，他点了头，文章当年就没有刊登出来。
    当林彪把毛泽东思想同马克思主义割裂开来，妄图废止马克思主义理论学习时，他大声疾呼“理论还是要系统地学”，并倡导制定了军队院校哲学、政治经济学、中共党史三门课大纲。
    谭政从建军新阶段我军的实际出发，力主没有文化就没有我军的现代化。并于１９５９年初主持制订了在全军干部中普及中、高等教育的十年规划。规划在广州当面请示了毛泽东同志，经过军委例会审查批准下发后，全军指战员展开了轰轰烈烈的文化大进军。许多老同志至今怀念着实施两年卓有成效的这一文化大进军，对它的被林彪中途打断，深表遗憾。
    尽管谭政的这些做法，当时并无反对林彪个人之意，但他如此敢于坚持实事求是，敢于坚持他所认识到的真理，敢于为了革命不去出卖原则。林彪虽然在１９６０年１月中央上海会议时还假惺惺地讲什么政治工作做得是好的，他很放心；但不久就多方挑剔、发难，到了１０月，便宣布谭政领导的政治工作“方向偏”了。他指责谭政与他既“不同心”，又“不协力”，对他的指示“雷打不动”。接着，就有人批评谭政对“毛泽东思想红旗”不是“举着”的，而是“扛着”的；随后，就升级为“反对毛泽东思想”和抵制“高举红旗”的“林副主席”了。他还被诬陷“为了贯彻执行彭黄路线”与总政治部的四个部长结成“反党宗派集团”。“文化大革命”一来，他当然在劫难逃，被押解北京，作彭德怀的“陪斗者”。这位１９２７年湘赣边界秋收起义的老战士，在“文革”中蹲了８年监牢，直到党的十一届三中全会以后，才得平反。然而这时的谭政，已经身心交瘁，病魔缠身，经过几年的卧床不起，终于咽下了最后一口气。
    谭政同志廉洁奉公，不谋私利的品格也是令人敬佩的。
    他任总政主任期间，我多次随他到东北、华东、华南、中南等地驻军调查研究和开会，他从来没有大搞游山逛景；他出国到莫斯科，苏方送给他的照像机、望远镜，回国后都交给机关使用了；他参观工厂，临走时厂领导将少量产品送他留念，悄悄放在车上，他发现后，一定退回，有时三送三退，横直不收；他几十年没回老家，一次回乡探望，乡亲很是高兴，临别送他点家乡食物，无非是几包茶叶，几斤腊肠，几块年糕，他再三推辞不受。父老坚持要给，他只好叫秘书付费，过后检查，觉得钱付少了，就再次加付，直到秘书把家乡人的收条交给他看，他才高兴起来。
    谭政同志革命的一生，主要是从事军队政治工作。他可以称得起是一位政治工作的巨匠。
    谭政《在西北局高干会上关于军队政治工作问题的报告》，是１９４４年在毛泽东同志主持下，由谭政同志精心写成的。毛泽东同志为这个报告增写了十几个段落，共３０００多字。这个报告是继古田决议后党在政治工作方面的又一个重要历史文献。可是，在谭政受批判后，这个报告竟被林彪下令更改篇名、抹掉谭政署名，打入冷宫。直到１９８３年，才经中央军委批准，恢复原貌，重新印发。今天，当我们迫切需要加强和改进政治工作的时候，不能不想到它。
    安息吧，谭政同志，人们是不会忘记你的！
