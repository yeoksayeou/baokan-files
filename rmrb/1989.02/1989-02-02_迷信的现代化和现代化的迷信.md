Title: The Modernization of Superstition and the Superstition of Modernization

As the Spring Festival approaches, many rural areas are busy sending off the Kitchen God and welcoming the God of Wealth, paying respects to ancestors. Half of these activities are to celebrate the New Year, and the other half are superstitious practices, all carried out with great fervor.

In recent years, some farmers have become wealthy, while others remain poor. However, whether rich or poor, they seem equally enthusiastic about building temples, burning incense, and worshipping gods. Large and small earth temples are becoming more numerous, and pilgrims to Buddhist and Taoist holy sites are endless. Even in some poor mountain villages, it is difficult to organize other activities, but if someone leads the way to raise funds to build a temple, it can be accomplished overnight.

In the countryside of Hunan, the author heard of a story: a certain village's farmers worshipped the local "Dai Gong Bodhisattva," but there was originally no temple, only a pile of yellow earth and a tree. Some farmers wanted to build a temple, but the township government naturally did not allow it. In 1987, the farmers secretly prepared the timber and bricks, and in one night, they completed the temple. The township government discovered it and had to acknowledge its existence.

With the increase in devotees, the income of temples and nunneries has also surged. The famous Nanyue Hengshan, for example, had 1.2 million visitors last year, many of whom came specifically to worship. Every year on the first day of the eighth lunar month, which is the birthday of the "South Mountain Great Transformation Heavenly Emperor," the number of pilgrims increases, and the incense burner in the South Mountain Temple alone burns incense sticks, paper money, and firecrackers worth 400,000 yuan per day. According to the Cultural Relics Bureau, the annual income from "merit money" for several temples in Nanyue ranges from 100,000 to 200,000 yuan.

The devotees believe they are paying respect to the Buddha, but in reality, they are enriching the monks and nuns. Due to the increased income, ancient temples not only have electricity but have also purchased cars, televisions, and tape recorders in recent years, allowing the monks to live a modernized life.

Some people say that superstition activities are also modernizing. Indeed, in the past, when someone died, breaking a few bowls and burning some paper money was enough. Now, in some rural areas, they even include a full set of paper-made household appliances. The procession at the front is accompanied by a band playing popular songs, truly reflecting the times.

At the same time, modernized superstition has also entered the countryside. In a county town, the author saw many farmers gathered around a sign that read "Scientific Fortune-Telling, Guaranteed Accuracy." Upon closer inspection, it turned out to be computer fortune-telling. Those seeking fortune would provide their age, education level, and interests, and the fortune-teller would input this information into the computer. Soon, the screen would display the results. People were asking about marriage, education, wealth, and more, and there were quite a few seekers.

The prevalence of feudal superstition in China's rural areas requires science and culture to enlighten people's minds. Today, the computer—this product of 20th-century advanced science—is actually the first to serve superstition, which cannot but make one feel the stubbornness and evil of feudal ignorance. At the same time, it warns us that taking effective measures to resist the spiritual infiltration of feudal superstition among the people is indeed urgent.

### 迷信的现代化和现代化的迷信

　　迷信的现代化和现代化的迷信
    挨近春节，不少农村送灶神，迎财神，敬祖先……一半是庆贺新春，一半是迷信活动，搞得热火朝天。
    这几年，一些农民富起来了，也有一些仍然受穷。但无论是富是穷，似乎都热衷于修庙烧香，拜佛敬神。大大小小的土地庙越来越多，到佛教、道教圣地敬香火的络绎不绝。就是一些穷山村，办点别的事困难，可如果有人带头集资修庙，一下子就办成了。
    在湖南乡下，记者听过这样一个故事：某乡农民崇信当地的“戴公菩萨”，但是原先没有庙，只有一堆黄土一棵树。一些农民想修个庙，乡政府当然不允许。１９８７年，农民们偷偷准备好了木料、砖瓦，用了一个晚上便把庙宇盖好了。乡政府发现，只好认可它的存在。
    随着善男信女的增加，寺庙庵堂的收入也大增。著名的南岳衡山，去年游客达到１２０万人次，这当中不少人是专门来朝圣敬神的。每年农历八月初一是“南岳大化司天昭圣帝”的生辰，这几天香客更盛，仅南岳大庙的焚香炉里，一天焚化的香木、线香、纸钱以及燃放的鞭炮就值４０万元。据文管所介绍，南岳几个寺庙，一年收“功德钱”最少的也有１０多万元，多的２０多万元。
    善男信女们以为这些是孝敬了菩萨，殊不知却敬了僧尼。由于收入增加，古老的寺庙不仅有了电灯，近几年又买了汽车、电视机、录音机等，出家人也开始过起现代化的生活。
    有人说，现在的迷信活动也开始现代化了。的确如此，过去为死人发丧，摔摔瓦盆烧烧纸钱也就罢了。如今一些农村还要赔上全套纸糊的家用电器，队伍前边的西乐鼓号吹的是通俗歌曲，也真有它的时代色彩。
    与此同时，现代化的迷信也进入了农村。在一个县城里，记者看见许多农民在一幅“科学算命，保你灵验”的招牌下围成一团，挤进去一看，原来是用电脑算命。求运者告知年龄、文化程度、兴趣爱好，算命者就把这些输入电脑，一会儿屏幕上即可显示出结果。一连几个，问婚姻、问升学、问发财等什么都有，求运者还真不少。
    封建迷信盛行于中国农村，需要科学文化来启迪人们的头脑。而今，电脑──这个２０世纪先进科学的产物，居然率先为迷信服务，不能不令人感到封建愚昧势力的冥顽不化和可恶可怕。同时也警告我们，采取有效措施抵制封建迷信对人民的精神蚕食，实在是迫在眉睫。
