The Spring Festival is just around the corner. How well the television stations have prepared for the Spring Festival Gala is a topic of great interest. Recently, a deputy director of Central Television told reporters: "Every year when we prepare for the Spring Festival Gala, Central Television is always 'trembling with fear' and 'walking on thin ice.' To satisfy the billions of viewers at various levels is truly 'as difficult as ascending to the sky.' We can only do our best, and we also hope that the broad audience can understand us. Lowering expectations means fewer disappointments."

I think this statement is quite realistic. In the past, there were often such situations: long before the Spring Festival, the media would start hyping up the preparations, talking about how many programs the television station had prepared, how many famous performers there would be, and how wonderful it would be. After watching the gala, people would feel that it was not as wonderful as advertised, and in their disappointment, they would inevitably complain, "All talk!"

"Lowering expectations means fewer disappointments." This is very true. It's not that the organizers can be content with mediocrity; there is indeed a problem of catering to diverse tastes. People watching television include the old and the young, with different levels of cultural background and varied artistic preferences. To satisfy everyone and make everyone happy is no easy task! Subjectively, we should strive for the best and do our utmost to get the job done, while at the same time hoping that the audience will understand and not have overly high expectations. This attitude is commendable.

From this, we can think about reform. Although it can and has brought benefits to the people of the whole country, it is indeed impossible to make every person benefit equally, and sometimes it requires people to make temporary sacrifices. We are full of confidence in the prospects of reform, but we should not have too high expectations for each step of the reform. In propaganda, if we talk too much and too soon about the benefits of reform, make too many promises, and raise the audience's expectations too high, it will do more harm than good. This aspect of experience and lessons is worth summarizing.

### 期望值不妨低一些

　　期望值不妨低一些
    上官茀
    春节转眼即到。今年电视台的联欢晚会准备得如何，是大家关心的。最近中央电视台一位副台长对新闻记者说：“每年搞春节联欢会，中央电视台都是‘战战兢兢’，‘如履薄冰’。要使各层次的上亿电视观众都得到满足，真是‘难于上青天’，我们只能尽全力而为之，也祈求广大的电视观众能理解我们。期望值低一些，失望也少一些。”
    我以为这番话颇有实事求是之意。过去常有这样的情况：离春节还早呢，就不断向群众吹风了：电视台准备了多少节目，有多少名角，如何精采，群众寄予很大的期望。等到看过晚会，又觉得并没有所说的那样精采，失望之余免不了抱怨一句：“瞎吹！”
    “期望值低一些，失望也少一些。”所言极是。不是说主事者可以不精益求精，确实有个众口难调的问题。坐在电视机前的有老有少，有不同的文化素养，各异的文艺爱好，要人人满意，皆大欢喜，谈何容易！主观上全力以赴，尽可能把事情办好，同时祈求广大观众给予理解，不要期望过高，这种态度是可取的。
    由此想到改革。尽管它可以而且已经给全国人民带来利益，也确实不可能同时使每个人都得到同等的利益，有时候还需要人们作出暂时的牺牲。我们对改革的前景充满信心，但对每一步改革的期望值又不可太高。在宣传上，对改革的效益说得太早，说得太满，许愿太多，把群众的胃口吊得高高的，弊多利少。这方面的经验教训，值得总结一下。
