Edition: 4

The tenth Panchen Erdeni Qoi Gyainzain, also known as Qambu Qidan, was born on February 3, 1938 (the third day of the first month in the Year of the Earth Tiger, 16th Rabjung) in a Tibetan peasant family in Wendu Township, Xunhua County, Qinghai Province. He passed away on January 28, 1989, in his new palace, Dechen Gangsang Phodrang, in Shigatse, Tibet Autonomous Region, at the age of 51.

After the passing of the ninth Panchen Erdeni, in 1941, the Panchen Council, following religious procedures and rituals, sent a search team composed of monastic and lay officials to select the reincarnation of the ninth Panchen. They identified the three-year-old Qambu Qidan as the reincarnation. In 1944, he was taken to Kumbum Monastery in Qinghai for upbringing, and the Panchen Council reported this to the then Central Government—the National Government—under the name of the Panchen Council's Tashilhamo Lama Losang Qainzain, seeking approval.

On June 3, 1949, the National Government Acting President Li Zongren issued an order approving Qambu Qidan as the tenth Panchen Erdeni, exempting him from the golden urn lottery. Subsequently, according to religious customs, he underwent the rituals of tonsure and ordination, taking the religious name Losang Chokyi Nyima Qoi Gyainzain, abbreviated as Qoi Gyainzain. On August 10 of the same year, the National Government specially dispatched Guan Jiyu of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission as an envoy to preside over the enthronement ceremony at Kumbum Monastery in Qinghai Province and issued a seal with both Chinese and Tibetan inscriptions for the "Tashilhunpo Council of the Panchen Erdeni in Tibet." Thus, Qoi Gyainzain officially inherited the legitimate position and authority of the previous Panchens, becoming the tenth Panchen, and was revered by the broad masses of monks and laypeople.

After the liberation of Xining in September 1949, Panchen Erdeni Qoi Gyainzain immediately sent people to contact the Communist Party of China. On October 1, the founding of the People's Republic of China, he sent a telegram to Chairman Mao Zedong and General Zhu De, expressing his support for the Communist Party of China and the people's government, hoping for the early liberation of Tibet, and willing to contribute to the cause of national reunification. He also proposed "awaiting orders to return to Tibet." Chairman Mao and General Zhu replied, encouraging him and highly praising his patriotic actions.

In 1950, Panchen Erdeni Qoi Gyainzain sent a delegation to Beijing to pay respects to the Central People's Government and proposed a plan to resolve the Tibet issue and more than ten demands, hoping for the early liberation of Tibet.

In April 1951, Panchen Rinpoche personally led the main officials of the Panchen Council to Beijing, expressing his sincere support for the Central People's Government and actively promoting and supporting the negotiations between the Central People's Government and the Tibetan local government on the matter of peacefully liberating Tibet. On May 23, the Central People's Government and the Tibetan local government signed the "Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet." On May 24, he led the entire Panchen Council to pay respects to Chairman Mao Zedong and congratulated the signing of the "Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet." On May 28, the Panchen Council issued a statement, enthusiastically supporting the agreement on measures for the peaceful liberation of Tibet, stating, "For the thorough liberation and development of the Tibetan nationality, for the consolidation and development of the victory of the Chinese people, we will firmly support the leadership of Chairman Mao, support the leadership of the Central People's Government and the Communist Party of China, and strive to correctly implement the entire agreement, for the unity of the Tibetan nationality with the nationalities of China and the unity within the Tibetan nationality." On May 30, he sent a congratulatory telegram to the Dalai Lama, pointing out that the signing of the "Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet" was a great victory for the Tibetan monks and laypeople, and that "Panchen is willing to contribute his humble efforts, sincerely unite, and under the wise leadership of the Central People's Government and Chairman Mao, assist you and the Tibetan local government in thoroughly implementing the agreement. Strive for the peaceful liberation of Tibet." Under the care and assistance of the Central People's Government, Panchen Rinpoche and the entire Panchen Council left Xining for Tibet in December 1951. Chairman Mao Zedong sent Habib Cui, then Vice Chairman of the Northwest Military and Political Committee, as a representative to see them off in Xining. On April 28, 1952, Panchen Rinpoche and his entourage arrived in Lhasa and were warmly welcomed by the leaders of the Central Government in Tibet, including Zhang Jingwu, and the monks and laypeople. That afternoon, Panchen Rinpoche went to the Potala Palace and had a historic meeting with the Dalai Lama in the Sunlight Hall. On June 23, he returned to Shigatse, Tibet, to the Tashilhunpo Monastery. After returning to Tibet, Panchen Rinpoche consistently and unwaveringly worked to maintain national unity, strengthen the unity between the Tibetan and Han nationalities, and promote the unity within Tibet, making significant contributions. In September 1954, Panchen Rinpoche and the Dalai Lama jointly attended the first session of the First National People's Congress in Beijing, where he was elected as a member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. During this period, he met with Party and state leaders such as Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, and Liu Shaoqi multiple times, expressing his determination to firmly uphold national unity and ethnic unity, and to contribute to the prosperity of the motherland and the progress of the nation.

In April 1956, the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region was established, and Panchen Rinpoche served as the first deputy chairman. In November of the same year, at the invitation of the Indian government, he went to India with the Dalai Lama to participate in the 2500th anniversary of the Buddha's Parinirvana and visited various places in India. During his stay in India, he enthusiastically praised the traditional friendship between China and India and their peoples in various settings, emphasizing the need to adhere to the "Seventeen-Point Agreement" and demonstrating his upright patriotic stance with actual actions.

In March 1959, the reactionary clique in the upper echelons of Tibet, in order to maintain the feudal serf system, publicly tore up the agreement on measures for the peaceful liberation of Tibet and launched a full-scale armed rebellion in Tibet. Panchen Rinpoche raised the banner of patriotism, unity, and progress, supporting the Central Government's policy of suppressing the rebellion while promoting reform, and actively supporting the People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet to suppress the rebellion. On March 28, Premier Zhou Enlai issued an order to dissolve the original Tibetan local government, with the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region exercising the functions of the Tibetan local government, and appointed Panchen Rinpoche as the acting chairman of the Preparatory Committee. The next day, Panchen Rinpoche immediately sent a telegram to Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou, supporting the State Council's decision, and quickly rushed from Shigatse to Lhasa to preside over the work of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region. Thereafter, under his personal leadership, the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region passed a series of major resolutions and decisions on policies and measures for suppressing the rebellion and democratic reform. He proposed the correct advocacy of "bringing the Constitution into the temples," which was included in the resolution on democratic reform of the temples. In the great historical transformation of overthrowing the feudal serf system in Tibet, implementing democratic reform, and establishing a people's democratic government, Panchen Rinpoche sincerely cooperated with the Communist Party of China, worked closely together, and made active and beneficial contributions to the liberation of the Tibetan people and the development and progress of Tibetan society. In April 1959, at the Second Session of the First National People's Congress, he was elected as a vice chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. In the mid-1960s, due to the "Leftist" errors, he was treated unfairly, and during the ten years of turmoil of the Cultural Revolution, Panchen Rinpoche suffered cruel persecution and underwent severe trials. However, his trust in the Communist Party of China and his love for the motherland never wavered. After the Gang of Four was smashed, Panchen Rinpoche wholeheartedly supported and actively promoted the implementation of the line, principles, and policies of the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. In 1980, he was re-elected as a vice chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. That August, Deng Xiaoping had a talk with him, praising him as "one of the best patriots in our country" and "a maintainer of national unity." In the new situation of reform and opening up, he followed the pace of the times, caring more about the interests of the motherland and the nation, and the common prosperity of all nationalities. To maintain national unity, develop the economy and culture of the Tibetan region and other national regions, and consolidate and develop the new type of relationship of equality, unity, and mutual assistance among the nationalities in the country, he worked hard with a burning patriotism and a strong sense of responsibility, proposing various opinions and suggestions to the Central Government. He enthusiastically supported and endorsed the series of policies and principles formulated by the Central Government for Tibet's work. In the past ten years, he has visited many places across the country and Tibetan regions. His footsteps have almost covered the entire Tibet and other Tibetan regions. Wherever he went, he enthusiastically propagated the policies and principles of the Central Government, the policies of the Communist Party of China on nationalities, religion, and united front work, and the importance of national unity, ethnic unity, and the common prosperity and development of all nationalities. At the same time, he always listened to the voices and demands of the masses in various places and reflected them to the Central Government and the relevant provincial and autonomous regional governments, playing a very good role in promoting the improvement of work. In recent years, he has led delegations to visit foreign countries several times and received foreign guests many times at home. In these activities, he explained China's various policies and work to foreign friends in a realistic manner, speaking of both achievements and shortcomings and difficulties, and at the same time expressing China's determination to adhere to reform and opening up and confidence in building socialism with Chinese characteristics, winning high praise and trust from foreign friends.

Panchen Rinpoche was very concerned about the development and progress of the Tibetan nationality and the inheritance and development of excellent Tibetan traditional culture. He was very concerned about the implementation of the "Law on Regional Autonomy for Nationalities" in Tibet, actively assisted the Party and the government in implementing policies on nationalities, religion, united front work, and other aspects, and paid attention to and maintained the unity between the Tibetan and Han nationalities and among all nationalities. He proposed the establishment of the "Fund for the Development of Tibet" and served as the chairman. He has always emphasized the issue of running schools and using Tibetan language and script based on the actual situation of Tibet. To promote the learning and use of Tibetan language and script, in July 1987, he initiated with Vice Chairman Alpo Yonten Gyatso the decision on "Several Provisions on Learning, Using, and Developing Tibetan Language and Script" at the Tibet Autonomous Region People's Congress.

As an outstanding leader of Tibetan Buddhism in our country, Panchen Rinpoche has a deep understanding of Buddhist classics. In 1956, during his visit to India, he was awarded an honorary doctorate in Buddhist studies by Nalanda University. In 1958, at the Great Debate of Buddhist Scriptures in Tashilhunpo Monastery in Tibet, he obtained the degree of "Gachen." Since 1958, he has been lecturing on Buddhist classics such as the "Great Exposition of the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment" and the "Kalachakra Tantra Initiation" at Kumbum Monastery in Qinghai and Tashilhunpo Monastery. He has carefully studied the works of Tsongkhapa and written Buddhist treatises such as "A Brief Exposition of the Great Exposition of the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment" and "The Generation and Completion Stages of the Two-Bodied Joyful Vajra." In recent years, he has been dedicated to studying major issues such as how to manage temples and train monks and nuns under socialist conditions and has personally presided over a pilot project at his main temple, Tashilhunpo Monastery, summarizing a set of valuable experiences. Under his initiative and personal leadership, the Higher Tibetan Buddhist Academy was established in Beijing, where he served as the president, setting a good example for cultivating Buddhist intellectuals who are politically devoted to the motherland and have a high level of Buddhist scholarship.

Panchen Vice Chairman served as a member of the Standing Committee of the First National People's Congress, a vice chairman of the Standing Committee of the Second, Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh National People's Congresses, a vice chairman of the Second and Fifth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, a standing committee member of the Third and Fourth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and the first deputy chairman and acting chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region. Since 1963, he has been the honorary president of the Buddhist Association of China.

Panchen Vice Chairman's life was one of unremitting struggle for the unity of the motherland, one of hard work for the prosperity of the state and the prosperity of the nation, one of sincere cooperation and mutual trust with the Communist Party of China, and one of propagating the Dharma and guiding the faithful to work for the people's well-being. He is indeed a great patriot, a renowned statesman, a loyal friend of the Communist Party of China, and an outstanding leader of Tibetan Buddhism in China.

The tenth Panchen Rinpoche will forever live in the hearts of the people of all nationalities in our country!

　　伟大的爱国主义者　著名的国务活动家　我党忠诚朋友   
    藏传佛教杰出领袖  班禅额尔德尼·确吉坚赞生平
    第十世班禅额尔德尼·确吉坚赞，俗名贡布慈丹。１９３８年２月３日（藏历十六绕迥之土虎年正月初三日）生于青海省循化县文都乡一个藏族农民家庭，１９８９年１月２８日在西藏自治区日喀则市他的新宫德虔格桑普彰逝世，终年５１岁。
    第九世班禅逝世后，１９４１年班禅堪布会议厅按照宗教手续和宗教仪轨，派出由僧俗官员组成的转世灵童寻访团，选定当时３岁的贡布慈丹为第九世班禅的转世灵童，１９４４年接往青海塔尔寺供养，并用班禅堪布会议厅扎萨喇嘛罗桑坚赞的名义，报告当时的中央政府——国民政府，请求批准。
    １９４９年６月３日，国民政府代总统李宗仁颁布命令，批准贡布慈丹为第十世班禅额尔德尼，免于金瓶掣签。之后，按照宗教惯例，举行了剃度、受戒等仪式，取法名为罗桑赤烈伦珠确吉坚赞，简称确吉坚赞。同年８月１０日，国民政府特派蒙藏委员会关吉玉为专使，在青海省塔尔寺主持了坐床典礼，并颁发汉、藏文合璧的“西藏班禅行辕堪布会议厅”印鉴。至此，确吉坚赞正式继承历世班禅的合法地位和职权，成为第十世班禅，受到广大僧俗群众的信仰和崇敬。
    １９４９年９月西宁解放后，班禅额尔德尼·确吉坚赞即派人同中国共产党联系。１０月１日，中华人民共和国成立，他立即致电毛泽东主席和朱德总司令，表示拥护中国共产党，拥护人民政府，希望早日解放西藏，愿为完成祖国统一大业贡献力量，并提出“待命返藏”。毛主席和朱总司令复电勉慰，对他的爱国主义举动予以高度赞扬。
    １９５０年，班禅额尔德尼·确吉坚赞派致敬团到北京，向中央人民政府致敬，并向中央提出了一个解决西藏问题的方案和十余项要求，盼望尽早解放西藏。
    １９５１年４月，班禅大师亲自率领班禅堪布会议厅主要官员到北京，表示竭诚拥护中央人民政府的决心，积极推动和支持中央人民政府和西藏地方政府关于和平解放西藏事宜的谈判。５月２３日，中央人民政府与西藏地方政府《关于和平解放西藏办法的协议》正式签字，５月２４日，他率领班禅堪布会议厅全体官员向毛泽东主席致敬，祝贺《关于和平解放西藏办法的协议》的签订。５月２８日班禅堪布会议厅发表声明，热烈拥护和平解放西藏办法的协议，表示“为了西藏民族的彻底解放和发展，为了巩固和发展中国人民的胜利，今后坚决拥护毛主席的领导，拥护中央人民政府和中国共产党的领导，为正确执行全部协议，为西藏民族与中国各民族的团结和西藏民族内部的团结而奋斗。”５月３０日他给达赖喇嘛发出祝贺电报，指出签订《关于和平解放西藏办法的协议》，是西藏僧俗人民的伟大胜利，“班禅愿竭绵薄，精诚团结，在中央人民政府和毛主席的英明领导下，协助您和西藏地方政府彻底实行协议。为和平解放西藏而奋斗。”在中央人民政府的关怀和帮助下，班禅大师和班禅堪布会议厅全体官员于１９５１年１２月从西宁起程返藏，毛泽东主席派当时的西北军政委员会副主席习仲勋同志为代表专程去西宁送行。１９５２年４月２８日，班禅大师及其一行到达拉萨，受到了中央驻藏代表张经武等领导人和僧俗群众隆重热烈的欢迎。当天下午，班禅大师即赴布达拉宫，在日光殿与达赖喇嘛举行了历史性会见。６月２３日返回西藏日喀则扎什伦布寺。班禅大师回到西藏以后，始终不渝地为维护祖国统一，增强藏汉民族的团结和各民族之间的团结，为促进西藏内部的团结，进行了坚持不懈的努力，做出了重大贡献。１９５４年９月，班禅大师同达赖喇嘛联袂来到北京，出席了第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议，当选为全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员和政协全国委员会副主席。在此期间，他多次见到毛泽东、周恩来、刘少奇等党和国家主要领导人，在每次会见中，他都表达了坚决维护祖国统一和民族团结，为祖国的富强和民族的进步出力的决心。
    １９５６年４月，西藏自治区筹备委员会成立，班禅大师任自治区筹委会第一副主任委员。同年１１月，应印度政府邀请，与达赖喇嘛一道去印度参加释迦牟尼涅槃２５００周年纪念活动，并去印度各地朝拜和参观访问。在印度期间，他在各种场合都热情赞扬中印两国和两国人民之间的传统友谊，强调要遵守《十七条协议》，以实际行动表明了他光明磊落的爱国立场。
    １９５９年３月，西藏上层反动集团为了维护封建农奴制度，公然撕毁和平解放西藏办法的协议，在西藏发动了全面武装叛乱。班禅大师高举爱国、团结、进步的旗帜，拥护中央关于边平叛边改革的方针，积极支持人民解放军驻藏部队平息叛乱。同年３月２８日，国务院总理周恩来发布命令，解散原西藏地方政府，由西藏自治区筹备委员会行使西藏地方政府职权，并任命班禅大师为自治区筹委会代理主任委员。班禅大师第二天立即致电毛主席、周总理，拥护国务院决定，并迅速从日喀则赶到拉萨主持西藏自治区筹备委员会的工作。此后，在他亲自主持下，自治区筹备委员会通过了一系列有关平叛和民主改革的方针政策等重大决议和决定。他提出的“宪法进寺庙”的正确主张，写进了有关寺庙民主改革的决议中。在西藏推翻封建农奴制度，实行民主改革，建立人民民主政权的伟大历史变革中，班禅大师同中国共产党真诚合作，亲密共事，为西藏人民的翻身解放，为西藏社会的发展进步，做出了积极的有益的贡献。１９５９年４月，在全国人民代表大会上，他当选为全国人大常委会副委员长。在６０年代中期，由于“左”的错误，他受到了不公正的对待，尤其是“文化大革命”十年动乱期间，班禅大师遭受到残酷的迫害，经受了严峻考验。但是他对中国共产党的信赖和对祖国的热爱，从来没有动摇过。粉碎“四人帮”以后，班禅大师衷心拥护和积极宣传贯彻中国共产党十一届三中全会以来的路线、方针和政策。１９８０年重新当选为全国人大常委会副委员长。当年８月，邓小平同志同他谈话时，称赞他是“我们国家一个最好的爱国者”，是“维护国家统一的”。在改革开放的新形势下，他跟随着时代的步伐前进，更加关心祖国的利益，民族的利益，关心各民族的共同繁荣。为维护祖国统一，发展藏族地区和各民族地区的经济文化建设，为巩固和发展国内各民族平等、团结、互助的新型关系，他怀着一颗炽热的爱国心和强烈的事业心，奋力工作，殚思竭虑，积极向中央提出各种意见和建议。他满腔热情地支持和拥护中央为西藏工作制定的一系列方针和政策。在近１０年来，他多次去全国各地和藏族地区视察工作，他的足迹几乎踏遍了整个西藏和其他藏族地区。无论走到哪里，他都热情地宣传中央的方针政策，宣传中国共产党的民族、宗教、统战政策，宣传祖国统一、民族团结、各民族共同繁荣发展的重要性。同时在各地总是倾听群众的呼声和要求，向中央和有关省、自治区的政府反映，对改进工作起了很好的促进作用。近几年来，他几次率代表团，出国访问，在国内多次会见外宾。在这些活动中，他坚持实事求是地向外国友人解释我国的各种政策和各方面工作，既讲成就，也讲不足和困难，同时又表明我国坚持改革开放的决心和对建成有中国特色的社会主义的信心，博得了外国友人的高度赞扬和信任。
    班禅大师十分关心藏族的发展和进步，关心对藏族优秀传统文化的继承和发展。他十分关心《民族区域自治法》在西藏的贯彻执行，积极协助党和政府落实民族、宗教、统战和其他各项政策，重视和维护藏汉民族之间和各民族之间的团结。他提议成立了“援助西藏发展基金会”，并担任主任委员。他一贯强调从藏族的实际出发办好教育的问题和使用藏语文问题。为推动藏语文的学习和使用，他于１９８７年７月同阿沛·阿旺晋美副委员长一起倡议，在西藏自治区人大会议上通过了《关于学习、使用、发展藏语文的若干规定》的决定。
    班禅大师作为我国藏传佛教的杰出领袖，在佛教经典的研习上有较深造诣。１９５６年在访问印度期间，被授予婆罗奈斯佛教大学荣誉佛学博士学位。１９５８年在西藏日喀则扎什伦布寺辩经大法会上，考取“噶钦”学位。从１９５８年起，就在青海塔尔寺和扎什伦布寺开讲佛教经典《普提道次第广论》、《时轮金刚灌顶法》等显密教义。他精心钻研宗喀巴大师的经学著作，著有《普提道次第广论简释》、《双身喜金刚生圆次第》等经学著作。近年来他致力于研究在社会主义条件下如何管理寺庙和培养僧尼等重大问题，并在他的主寺扎什伦布寺亲自主持试点，总结出了一套很有价值的经验。在他倡导和亲自主持下，在北京创办了中国藏语系高级佛学院，亲自担任院长，为培养政治上热爱祖国，宗教上有较高佛学造诣的佛教知识分子，开创了良好的范例。
    班禅大师历任第一届全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员，第二、五、六、七届全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长，第二、五届全国政协副主席，第三、四届全国政协常务委员，西藏自治区筹备委员会第一副主任委员、代理主任委员，１９６３年以来，一直担任中国佛教协会名誉会长。
    班禅副委员长的一生，是为维护祖国统一而奋斗不息的一生，是为国家的富强和民族的繁荣而辛勤操劳的一生，是同中国共产党真诚合作、肝胆相照的一生，是为弘扬佛法、引导信教群众为人民谋福利的一生。他不愧是一位伟大的爱国主义者，著名的国务活动家，中国共产党的忠诚朋友，中国藏传佛教的杰出领袖。
    第十世班禅大师将永远活在我国各民族人民的心中！
