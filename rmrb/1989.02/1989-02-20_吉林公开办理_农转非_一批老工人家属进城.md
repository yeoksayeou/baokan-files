	More than 98% of the public security sub-bureaus in Jilin Province have implemented a system of publicly handling the entire process of "agricultural to non-agricultural" household registration. This includes the allocation of annual quotas, application conditions, evaluation process, evaluation results, submission of names, and approval results, all of which are made public. Over the past nine months, the province has publicly approved 9,780 "agricultural to urban" household registrations, involving 17,682 people. This has resolved the issue of household registration for a batch of elderly workers with long service records and spouses living separately.
