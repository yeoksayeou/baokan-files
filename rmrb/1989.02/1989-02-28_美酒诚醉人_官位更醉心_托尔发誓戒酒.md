Wine truly intoxicates, but official positions intoxicate the heart. Tor vows to quit drinking.

NEW YORK, Feb. 26 (Xinhua) — John Tower, nominated for the position of U.S. Secretary of Defense, denied in a television interview on Saturday night that he is an alcoholic and vowed that if he becomes the Secretary of Defense, he will completely give up alcohol, whether it is wine, beer, or hard liquor. If he breaks this promise, he will resign.

Since the Senate Armed Services Committee began investigating his alleged alcoholism, womanizing, and connections with the military-industrial complex, Tower has remained silent. Last Thursday, the committee voted 11 to 9 against his nomination.

Regarding his womanizing, Tower, who has been single for three and a half years, does not deny having relationships with women, but he believes this is normal.

　　美酒诚醉人　官位更醉心
    托尔发誓戒酒
    新华社华盛顿２月２６日电  被提名为美国防部长的约翰·托尔星期六晚上接受电视采访时否认自己嗜酒，并发誓他如担任国防部长将彻底告别“杯中之物”，不管是葡萄酒、啤酒还是烈性酒，如果违背这一诺言，他将辞职。
    自参议院军委会就他的嗜酒、风流韵事以及与军火工业界的关系进行调查以来，托尔一直保持沉默。上星期四参议院军委会以１１票对９票的多数否决对他的提名。
    关于风流韵事，作为３年半以来一直独身的单身汉，托尔并不否认与女性有交友来往，但他认为这是正常的。
