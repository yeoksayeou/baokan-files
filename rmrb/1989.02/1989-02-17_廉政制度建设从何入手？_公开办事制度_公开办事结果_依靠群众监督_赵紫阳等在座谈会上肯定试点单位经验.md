The Central Political System Reform Research Office held a symposium on anti-corruption system construction, which concluded today. The symposium proposed that to build an anti-corruption system, it is necessary to adapt to the needs of developing a socialist commodity economy, improve the standardization and transparency of government departments' management work, and eliminate the breeding ground for the exchange of power and money. Currently, anti-corruption system construction can start with "two opennesses and one supervision," that is, openness in administrative procedures, openness in administrative results, and reliance on public supervision to promote anti-corruption construction. The experience of anti-corruption system construction pilot units shows that as the standardization of administrative management departments in handling public affairs improves, and as administrative procedures and results are made public, a broad social supervisory force can be formed. This will effectively constrain the exercise of power, reduce the breeding and spread of corruption, and even if corruption occurs, it will be easily exposed and punished under public scrutiny.

Information on pilot units:

Two Opennesses and One Supervision Prove Effective

The general public overwhelmingly approves

In March of last year, the Second Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee proposed: as much as possible, the government's administrative procedures should be made public to facilitate public supervision. Over the past year, some localities and departments, based on the summary of past experiences, have started from the "hot spots" that the public is most concerned about and from the links where corruption is most likely to occur. They have focused on the standardization and transparency of administrative behavior, and have done a lot of exploratory work. The Agricultural Bank of Heilongjiang Province has made public the procedures and results of loan issuance, as well as the recovery and arrears of loans, item by item and in a timely manner to the public, and handed them over to the public for supervision. This has basically overcome the improper practices in agricultural loans. The 90 million yuan loan issued by the Zhaodong Branch of this provincial bank has not yet found any case of fraud. In Yanzhou City, Shandong Province, through the openness of administrative procedures, the distribution of state-subsidized fertilizers among counties, townships, villages, and farmers has been published monthly in the local area, requiring farmers to participate in supervision. This has fundamentally eliminated the phenomenon of fertilizers being allocated through backdoors, and the relationship between officials and the masses has been restored to a close one. In Xincang County, Hebei Province, the distribution of agricultural materials, the approval of homestead sites, the contracting of orchards and enterprises, and the quota for the second child in family planning have been handed over to the village self-governance committee for supervision or decision-making, improving the fairness of handling these difficult tasks. Half a year after the Dongcheng District of Beijing implemented the openness of administrative procedures and results, 1,000 questionnaires were issued, with more than 70% of the respondents agreeing that "two opennesses and one supervision" have indeed played a good role in anti-corruption construction. After Huangpu District, Shanghai, implemented "two opennesses and one supervision," 1,000 questionnaires were also issued, with the vast majority expressing satisfaction or basic satisfaction with this work. The public in these two districts generally believe that "two opennesses and one supervision" have not only improved the integrity of state officials but also improved the efficiency of government agencies in serving residents and enterprises. In Fuyang Region, Anhui Province, through the standardization of government behavior, the chaotic situation of multiple interventions, multiple management, arbitrary fees, and arbitrary fines in the market has been rectified, solving the problem of farmers finding it difficult to travel and enter the market. The "two opennesses and one supervision" activities promoted in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, have begun to cover all government services for residents, government services for enterprises, and upper-level government services for lower-level governments. The anti-corruption system construction in Yantai City, Shandong Province, is carried out in conjunction with the establishment of a new order for socialist commodity economy, promoting the improvement of urban management levels. The symposium, while exchanging the above situations, believed that these phenomena are very precious and very gratifying. The pilot units have improved the system regulations item by item, solved practical problems one by one, and improved the standardization and transparency of government activities step by step, thus making the anti-corruption system construction achieve tangible results and receive the approval of the general public in the pilot areas.

The symposium believed that the pilot units implementing "two opennesses and one supervision" include both rural and urban areas; both grassroots and leading organs; from a small police station, industrial and commercial administration office, tax office, grain office, power supply office, bank business office to a county, a district, or even a city. Their situations are varied, but they have all taken the road of relying on "two opennesses and one supervision" to promote anti-corruption system construction, which seems to be a common starting point. The situation of the pilot units proves that as long as formalism is not pursued, and the work is done seriously and solidly, there will definitely be visible results; as long as the work is persisted in and carried out continuously, there will definitely be sustained and significant results.

Central leaders said:

Promote the successful experiences of various places

There is hope in solving the problem of corruption

On February 14, Comrades Zhao Ziyang, Hu Qili, Qiao Shi, Rui Xiongwen, Yan Mingfu, and Wen Jiabao listened to the reports of some comrades who participated in the anti-corruption system symposium in the Huairen Hall of Zhongnanhai. They affirmed the direction and approach of anti-corruption system construction and encouraged everyone to continue to do a good job and promote it steadily.

Zhao Ziyang pointed out: Through anti-corruption system construction to solve the problem of clean government in party and government organs, some places, especially some grassroots levels, have already accumulated a lot of good experiences. Although these experiences are still preliminary, this matter is very promising.

Hu Qili said while listening to the report: Many countries have encountered the phenomenon of official corruption in the process of economic development, and some countries have not solved this problem until now. This poses a very serious question to us, a socialist country ruled by the Communist Party: can we avoid the occurrence of this universal phenomenon? Today's report gives us confidence, showing that the masses and the grassroots have taken action.

Qiao Shi said: The problem of clean government ultimately involves the ruling position of the Communist Party. Under the conditions of reform and opening up, can we insist on clean government, or will there be widespread corruption? This is a fundamental problem. This problem not only must be solved but also can be solved. Starting from the "hot spots" at that time and place, and from the issues that the masses are most concerned about, seeking solutions to problems step by step, is a good approach, and the facts have also proven to be successful.

Rui Xiongwen said: The publicization of government behavior and placing it under public supervision is not only anti-corruption construction but also democratic construction. Now there are many difficulties, but as long as everyone takes action, a way can be found to solve the problem.

Wen Jiabao said: Although the current anti-corruption system construction is mainly based on grassroots system construction, it will inevitably promote the reform of upper-level management systems, methods, and even management systems. It is hoped that local party committees and government departments will pay attention to summarizing experiences and providing guidance.

Zhao Ziyang emphasized:

Clean government relies on system construction

Pay attention to the important role of the Party

Zhao Ziyang emphasized: Over the past year, the Central Committee has repeatedly stressed that the issue of clean government should be placed on the important agenda of party committees at all levels. While developing productive forces and socialist commodity economy, we must prominently solve the issue of clean government. We must prevent the spread of corruption and make socialism play its due advantages.

He said: The experiences created at the grassroots level in solving the problem of clean government are very valuable. Although they are preliminary, they represent a way to solve the problem, that is, "two opennesses and one supervision." At least it has been proven to be very applicable to the grassroots level, and I think it is also an important method for leading organs to solve the problem of clean government. With this, there will be a great restraint. The solution to the problem of clean government cannot rely on campaigns but on system construction. The system must be known to the people, that is, openness. The system is open, the results of work are open, and there is supervision. Reporting is an important form of supervision. Openness itself is also supervision. Once it is open, it can play a supervisory role. Grasping the openness of administrative rules, relying on public supervision, and establishing internal and social restraint mechanisms to prevent corruption, I think this is a good approach. In system construction, special attention should be paid to the important role of the Party. Do not oppose the role of the Party and the role of clean government, but rely on the role of the Party to promote and guarantee the construction of a clean government system.

Zhao Ziyang put forward requirements:

Promote the establishment of a new order for commodity economy

Promote the democratic political construction of our country

Zhao Ziyang pointed out: The construction of an anti-corruption system is essentially an important part of establishing a new order for commodity economy and building democratic politics. We should follow this approach, work hard, continuously improve, enrich, and deepen it. Through the construction of an anti-corruption system, we can promote the establishment of a new order for commodity economy and promote democratic political construction. We should combine the construction of an anti-corruption system with the establishment of the overall new order for commodity economy and democratic political construction. He said: Our country is so large, and the development of the economy is unbalanced. The law enforcement and management departments of the government also have very unbalanced strengths. It seems that the establishment of a new order for socialist commodity economy should first take the lead in large cities, medium-sized cities, and coastal open areas. This is not only necessary but also possible, with conditions to take the lead.

Zhao Ziyang finally pointed out: In carrying out the construction of an anti-corruption system, on the one hand, we should start from the grassroots and localities to carry out pilot projects, and on the other hand, the central and provincial levels should also participate. We should not only strengthen the support, guidance, and coordination for the pilot areas and units, solve the problems that arise in the pilot projects, but also carry out some pilot projects ourselves.

In addition to exchanging experiences, this symposium also preliminarily discussed how to further promote the construction of an anti-corruption system. The comrades from various places and departments who attended the meeting all expressed that in the future, those who have not carried out pilot projects should hurry up to do so; those who have carried out pilot projects should gradually promote them to a larger scope and a higher level. They also expressed that they must insist on practical spirit, seek practical results, and avoid formalism. This year, next year, and the year after next, we must continue to work on it and gradually create an atmosphere.

Those who attended this symposium included the responsible comrades of the party committees of various provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the Central Government, and municipalities with separate plans, as well as the responsible comrades of the political system reform research institutions of various places. There were also responsible comrades from relevant departments of the Central Committee and the State Council. Comrades from Dongcheng District, Beijing, Yantai City, Shandong Province, Fuyang Region, Anhui Province, Xincang County, Hebei Province, State Taxation Bureau, Fujian Province, Huangpu District, Shanghai, Nanjing City, Jiangsu Province, Yanzhou City, Shandong Province, Agricultural Bank of Heilongjiang Province, Chengdu City, Sichuan Province, and the Industrial and Commercial Administration Bureau of Siping City, Jilin Province, successively spoke at the meeting. Deputy Director of the Central Political System Reform Research Office, He Guanghui, spoke at the beginning of the meeting. Director of the Central Political System Reform Research Office, Bao Tong, made a summary at the end of the meeting. Relevant department heads of the Central and State Organs, Wang Deqing, Zhang Siqun, Lin Zhun, Xu Qing, and Yun Shiying, also spoke at the meeting. This symposium was held from February 13 to 16.

　　廉政制度建设从何入手？   
    公开办事制度　公开办事结果　依靠群众监督   
    赵紫阳等在座谈会上肯定试点单位经验
    新华社北京２月１６日电  今天结束的中央政治体制改革研究室召开的廉政制度建设座谈会提出：进行廉政制度建设，就是要适应发展社会主义商品经济的需要，提高政府部门管理工作的规范程度和公开程度，以消除权力与金钱交易的温床；当前的廉政制度建设，可以从“两公开、一监督”入手，即：公开办事制度，公开办事结果，依靠群众监督，推进廉政建设。廉政制度建设试点单位的经验表明，行政管理部门处理社会公共事务的规范化程度提高了，办事制度和办事结果公开了，就能形成广泛的社会监督力量，对权力的行使就会产生有效的制约机制，就可以减少腐败现象的滋生蔓延，即使出现了，在众目睽睽之下，也容易败露，容易受到制裁。
    　　　　试点单位的信息：
    　　两公开一监督行之有效
    　　广大人民群众普遍叫好
    去年３月，党的十三届二中全会提出：要尽可能地公开政府的办事制度，便于群众监督。一年来，一些地方和部门在总结以往经验的基础上，从群众意见最大、最关心的“热点”入手，从最容易发生腐败现象的环节抓起，着眼于行政行为的规范化和公开化，做了不少探索性的工作。农业银行黑龙江省分行把贷款发放的制度和结果、贷款的回收和拖欠及时地一笔一笔地向群众公开，交给群众监督，基本上克服了农贷上的不正之风。这个省分行肇东市支行贷出的９０００余万元巨款，至今没有发现有一笔舞弊现象。山东省郯城县通过公开办事制度，将国家平价供应的化肥在县、乡、村、农户之间的分配逐月在当地公布，要求农民都来参加监督，从根本上杜绝了化肥走后门的现象，干群之间恢复了亲密的鱼水关系。河北省藁城县把农用物资分配、宅基地审批、果林和企业承包、计划生育的二胎指标交给村民自治委员会监督或决定，提高了处理这些难度很高的工作的公正程度。北京市东城区公开办事制度和办事结果半年后，发出了１０００张调查问卷，７０％以上的答卷认为“两公开、一监督”对廉政建设确实起了较好的作用。上海市黄浦区实行“两公开、一监督”后，也发出了１０００张问卷，绝大多数对此项工作表示满意或基本满意。这两个区的群众普遍认为，“两公开、一监督”既提高了国家公职人员的廉洁程度，也提高了政府机关为居民和企业办事的效率。安徽省阜阳地区通过规范政府行为，整顿了市场上多头插手、多头管理、乱收费、乱罚款的混乱局面，解决了农民“上路难、进市难”的问题。江苏省南京市推行的“两公开、一监督”活动，开始全面覆盖政府为居民、政府为企业、上级政府为下级政府办事的各项政务活动。山东省烟台市的廉政制度建设是围绕建立社会主义商品经济新秩序配套进行的，促进了城市管理水平的提高。座谈会在交流上述情况时认为，这些现象是非常可贵的，也是十分可喜的。各试点单位一项一项地完善制度规章，一件一件地解决实际问题，一步一步地提高政务活动的规范程度和公开程度，这就使廉政制度建设取得了实实在在的效果，受到了试点地区广大人民群众的好评。
    座谈会认为，进行“两公开、一监督”的试点单位，有农村，也有城市；有基层，也有领导机关；小到一个派出所、工商所、税务所、粮管所、供电所、银行营业所，大到一个县、一个区乃至一个市。它们的情况千差万别，但都走到了依靠“两公开、一监督”，促进廉政制度建设的路子上来，看来这确实是一个共同的起点。试点单位的情况证明，只要不搞形式主义，认认真真地抓，扎扎实实地抓，就一定会有看得见的效果；只要坚持不懈地继续抓下去，就一定会持续地收到显著的效果。
    　　　　中央领导同志说：
    　　大力推广各地成功经验
    　　解决腐败问题大有希望
    ２月１４日，赵紫阳、胡启立、乔石、芮杏文、阎明复、温家宝等同志，在中南海怀仁堂听取了参加廉政制度座谈会的部分同志的汇报，他们肯定了廉政制度建设的方向和路子，鼓励大家继续好好抓下去，并稳步地推广开来。
    赵紫阳指出：通过廉政制度建设解决党政机关廉洁问题，一些地方，特别是一些基层，已经有了不少好的经验。这些经验尽管还是初步的，但这件事很有希望。
    胡启立在听取汇报时说：许多国家在经济发展的过程中，都出现了官员腐败的现象，有的国家这个过程一直拖到现在也没有解决。这就向我们共产党执政的社会主义国家提出了一个非常严峻的问题，我们能不能避免这一普遍现象的出现？今天的汇报给人以信心，说明广大群众和基层行动起来了。
    乔石说：廉政问题，归根结底涉及到共产党的执政地位。在改革开放条件下，能不能坚持为政清廉，会不会发生普遍的腐败，是一个根本的问题。这个问题不但必须解决，非解决不可，也是可以解决的。从当时当地的“热点”问题，从群众最关心的问题着手，一步一步寻找解决问题的办法，是一条好路子，事实也证明是成功的。
    芮杏文说：政府的行为公开化，置于群众监督之中，既是廉政建设，也是民主建设。现在有很多难题，只要大家都动手，是能够找出一条路子，找到解决办法的。
    温家宝说：廉政制度建设，虽然目前较多的是从基层制度建设着手，但是必然会促进上层的管理制度、管理办法以至管理体制的改革。希望地方党委和政府部门注意总结经验，进行指导。
    　　　　赵紫阳强调指出：
    　　为政清廉要靠制度建设
    　　注意发挥党的重要作用
    赵紫阳强调指出：近一年来，中央多次讲过，廉政问题要摆到各级党委的重要议事日程上来。我们在发展生产力、发展社会主义商品经济的同时，必须突出地解决廉洁问题。要防止腐败现象的蔓延，使社会主义能发挥它应有的优越性。
    他说：解决廉政问题，下边创造的经验很可贵。尽管是初步的，但代表一条解决问题的路子，就是“两公开、一监督”。至少已经证明它很适用于基层，我看对领导机关也是解决廉政问题的一个很重要的方法。真正有这一条，就有很大的制约力。解决廉政问题决不能靠搞运动，要靠制度建设。靠制度，这个制度就必须使人民都知道，就是公开，制度公开，办事结果公开，还有监督。举报就是一种重要的监督形式。公开本身也是监督，一公开就能起到监督作用。抓住公开办事规则，依靠群众监督，建立内部的、社会的制约机制来防止腐败，我看是好路子。在制度建设中，要特别注意发挥党的重要作用。不要把依靠党的作用，发挥党的作用同廉政对立起来，而是要依靠党的作用来促进和保证廉政制度建设。
    　　　　赵紫阳提出要求：
    　　推动建立商品经济新秩序
    　　推动我国的民主政治建设
    赵紫阳指出：廉政制度建设实质上是建立商品经济新秩序和建设民主政治的重要组成部分。要按这个路子扎扎实实走下去，不断完善、不断丰富、不断深入。通过廉政制度建设，可以推动商品经济新秩序的建立，推动民主政治建设。要把廉政制度建设同整个商品经济新秩序的建立、民主政治的建设很好地结合起来。他说：我们国家这么大，经济发展不平衡，政府执法部门、管理部门力量也很不平衡。看来，建立社会主义商品经济新秩序，应该首先在大城市、中等城市和沿海开放地区先行一步。这样做既有必要，也有可能，有条件先行一步。
    赵紫阳最后指出：进行廉政制度建设，一方面要从基层、从地方开始搞试点，另一方面，中央和省这两级的部门也要参加进去，既要加强对试点地区和单位的支持、指导和协调，解决试点中出现的问题，自己也可以搞一些试点。
    这次座谈会除了交流经验，还初步讨论了如何进一步推进廉政制度建设的问题。各地和各部门参加会议的同志都表示，今后，没有试点的要抓紧搞试点；已经搞了试点的，要逐步在较大范围和较高层次上推开。他们还表示，一定要坚持求实精神，讲求实效，切忌流于形式。今年要抓，明年要抓，后年还要抓，逐步抓出一个气候来。
    出席这次座谈会的有各省、自治区、直辖市以及计划单列城市的党委负责同志和各地政治体制改革研究机构的负责人，还有中央、国务院有关部门的负责同志。北京东城区、山东烟台市、安徽阜阳地区、河北藁城县、国家税务局、福建省、上海黄浦区、江苏南京市、山东郯城县、农业银行黑龙江省分行、四川成都市以及吉林四平市工商局的同志，先后在大会上发了言。中央政治体制改革研究室副主任贺光辉在会议开始时讲了话。会议结束时，中央政治体制改革研究室主任鲍彤作了总结，中央和国家机关有关部门负责同志王德瑛、张思卿、林准、徐青、云世英等也在会上讲了话。这个座谈会是２月１３日至１６日召开的。
