Japanese House of Representatives Speaker Kenzo Horiuchi today admitted that he had received political donations totaling 19 million yen from Recruit Co., Ltd.

At a press conference held at his official residence, Horiuchi said that up until last April, he had received 4 million yen in political donations from the company. He also allowed the company to purchase 500 tickets for his lectures, amounting to 15 million yen.

There are signs that the "Recruit scandal" is rapidly spreading throughout Japan's political circles.
