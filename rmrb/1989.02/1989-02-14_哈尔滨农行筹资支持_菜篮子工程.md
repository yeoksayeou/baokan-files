Harbin Agricultural Bank Raises Funds to Support "Vegetable Basket Project"

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, February 13 (Correspondent Sun Tao, Reporter Zhang Guangyuan) Harbin Agricultural Bank has raised funds through various channels to support the city's "Vegetable Basket Project." Last year, the loans for this project exceeded 50 million yuan.

	To ensure the funds needed for the base construction, last year, Harbin Agricultural Bank took measures such as vigorously promoting savings deposits and recovering overdue loans to raise 50.3 million yuan as medium and long-term loans to support the construction of vegetable, livestock, and fishery bases. The city utilized these funds to build 4,600 mu of new spring vegetable bases, complete the infrastructure of 10,000 mu of summer vegetable bases, build 6 new seedling centers, construct 250,000 square meters of new vegetable storage facilities, develop 36,000 mu of fish farming waters, restore, expand, and renovate 6 pig breeding farms, build 2 new breeding chicken farms with a capacity of 10,000 chickens each, construct 4 slaughter and processing plants, 7 meat cold storage facilities, and 7 dairy plants. This significantly enhanced the production, processing, and storage capacities of vegetables and livestock meat. This year, Harbin Agricultural Bank plans to allocate 70 million yuan in special loans to address the construction of supporting facilities.

    据新华社哈尔滨２月１３日电（通讯员孙涛、记者张广远）哈尔滨市农业银行多方面、多渠道筹集资金，支持市里“菜篮子工程”建设，去年用于此项建设的贷款超过５０００万元。
    为保证基地建设所需资金，去年，哈尔滨市农业银行通过狠抓储蓄存款和到逾期贷款回收等措施，集中５０３０万元作为中长期贷款支持菜、牧、渔三大基地建设。全市利用这些资金新建春菜基地４６００亩，配套完善夏菜基地１万亩，新建育苗中心６处，新建菜库２．５万平方米，开发养鱼水面３．６万亩，恢复扩建改建种猪场６处，新建万只种鸡场２处，屠宰加工厂４处、肉食冷藏库、乳品厂７处，使蔬菜和畜禽肉的生产、加工、储藏能力有了很大增强。今年，哈尔滨市农行计划拿出７０００万元专项贷款解决配套设施建设。
