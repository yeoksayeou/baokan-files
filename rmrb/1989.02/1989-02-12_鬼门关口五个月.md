Five fishermen stood on the deck of a fishing boat drifting in the Pacific Ocean, their faces expressionless, their eyes fixed on the blue sky above the equator. The night before, they had drunk the last drop of water, their bodies already weak, and they were walking towards death.

The 27-year-old crew member, José Omar González, thought, "This is it! We're done!" But he did not feel ashamed, for in the 4 months of battling storms and waves, they had never shown a hint of fear. What he felt proud of was that they had fought like men and would die like men.

González took out a purple shirt and shorts from his travel bag, removed his clothes that had been torn into rags, and put on clean, neat clothes. With a hoarse voice, he said to his comrades, "This is how I want to die!"

One by one, his fellow sailors changed into clean clothes and gathered on the deck, silently gazing at the endless sea...

This was a moving scene from the recent story of five brave men fighting the sea in Costa Rica.

On January 19, 1988, González and the captain, Obrego, set sail from Costa Rica's Puntarenas port on the "Cairo III" fishing boat to fish in the Pacific. The plan was to return after 8 days. For the first 6 days, the sea was calm, and the crew worked diligently, with a good catch. The captain encouraged the crew, saying, "Let's cast one more net, and then we'll return!"

However, as night fell, strong winds blew, and thunder rumbled from afar. The sky to the north darkened. The captain shouted, "Storm!" The crew immediately sprang into action in the cabin. The fierce wind and waves tore away the fishing nets, blew off the hatch covers, and let in seawater. The crew used buckets to bail out the water and reinforced the doors with screws. The captain rushed to the radio to get some valuable information, but the radio had already malfunctioned and received nothing.

The crew tried to steer the ship towards the shore, but in the storm, they couldn't see the shore. The Puntarenas port had sent a patrol boat to search for the "Cairo III" and tried to contact it via radio, but to no avail.

Two weeks later, the wind subsided, but the waves pushed the "Cairo III" far out to the west. However, the crew believed that if the ship continued to drift west, they would eventually reach the shore. To speed up the drift, they made a 6-meter-high mast from the cabin beams and used blankets to make a sail.

By early March, González was almost desperate. He took an empty medicine bottle from his backpack and wrote on the back of a medicine instruction sheet, "Dear wife, I want to live strongly, but God is making it difficult for me. If I die, you must live on and tell the daughter that I died so that they could live a better life." He put the note in the bottle and threw it on the deck. In the two months since the storm, the crew, lacking water and food, became increasingly weak. After drifting at sea for several dozen days, the ship's hull was covered with algae, attracting sea turtles. González carefully caught a sea turtle and killed it with a knife. The crew finally got food. Soon, the rain brought fresh water, delaying their death. They used the turtle's blood to attract sharks, thus obtaining more food. In total, about 100 sea turtles were sacrificed.

May 31 was an unforgettable day; the freshwater barrel was almost empty. The next day, they put on clean clothes, preparing to leave the world.

On the night of June 4, the crew lay on the deck, waiting for God to take them. Unexpectedly, the sky was filled with dark clouds, and it rained again. The barrels were filled with water, and the crew drank their fill. Thus, they could continue to survive.

On the afternoon of June 14, González saw a white tuna fishing boat from the front. The person on the bridge saw the "Cairo III" with binoculars. González could not contain his excitement and jumped into the sea, swimming towards the boat. Soon, the Japanese fishing boat rescued the five Costa Rican fishermen. At that time, they were only 1,126 kilometers away from Honolulu. A week later, they flew back to Costa Rica's capital, San José.

This small wooden fishing boat drifted at sea for a total of 142 days, covering 5,760 kilometers, a first in the history of world navigation.

　　鬼门关口五个月
    世绍
    ５个渔民站在漂泊于太平洋上的渔船甲板上，脸上毫无表情，两眼直望赤道上空的蓝天。头一天晚上，他们喝干了最后一滴水，身体已虚弱不堪，正在向死亡走去。
    ２７岁的船员约·奥马尔·贡萨雷斯心想，“这下我们可完了！”但是他并不感到羞愧，因为在与暴风和海浪搏斗的４个多月里，他们从来没有一丝怯阵的表现。他深感自豪的是，他们像男子汉那样战斗，将像大丈夫那样死去。
    贡萨雷斯从旅行包里取出了紫色衬衣和短裤，脱去身上已撕成碎布片的衣服，穿上干净、整齐的服装，用嘶哑的声音对战友们说：“我就是要这样死去！”
    接着，同船战友一个接一个地换上了整洁的服装，然后聚集在甲板上，默默地注视着一望无际的海洋……
    这是不久前在哥斯达黎加广为传诵的５勇士斗大海的动人一幕。
    １９８８年１月１９日，贡萨雷斯和船长奥勃雷戈驾驶着“开罗—Ⅲ”号渔船，从哥斯达黎加的彭塔雷纳斯港出发，到太平洋上捕鱼。原计划８天后返航。头６天里，洋面上十分平静，船员们个个勤奋作业，收获不小。船长鼓励船员们说：“再打一网，我们就返航了！”
    然而当夜幕降临，海面上刮起阵阵大风，从远处传来了隆隆雷声，北面的天空阴沉了下来。船长奥勃雷戈吼叫道：“暴风！”船舱里，船员立即行动起来。狂风恶浪刮跑了渔网，掀开了舱盖，灌进了海水。船员们用水桶把水舀出舱外，再用螺丝把门加固起来。船长冲到收音机旁边，想得到一些有价值的信息，然而收音机早失灵了，什么也收不到。
    船员们设法把船向海岸靠近，但暴风中根本看不见海岸的影子。彭塔雷纳斯港口曾派出海岸巡逻艇寻找“开罗—Ⅲ”号，并用无线电与之联络，但一无所获。
    两周后风势减弱了，海浪却把“开罗—Ⅲ”号往西推出去很远很远。不过船员们深信，如船一直往西漂，他们最终会到达海岸。为了加快船的漂移速度，他们用船舱的梁木做了一根６米多高的桅杆，用毯子做成风帆。
    到了３月初，贡萨雷斯几乎感到绝望了。他从背包里取出一个空药瓶，在一张药品说明书背面写上：“亲爱的妻子，我强烈地要活下去，但上帝却难为我。如果我死了，你一定要活下去，告诉女儿我是为了她们能生活得更美好而死的。”他把遗言放进瓶里，掷在甲板上。在遭暴风袭击后的两个月里，船员们因缺水少食，身体越来越虚弱。经过几十天海上漂流后，船壳上长满了青苔，引来了海龟。贡萨雷斯小心翼翼地抓住了一只海龟，用刀宰了。船员们终于获得了食物。不久，暴雨又送来了淡水，这样他们的死期又推迟了。他们用海龟的血引来鲨鱼，从而得到更多的食物。前后大约有１００多只海龟成了牺牲品。
    ５月３１日是个难忘的日子，淡水桶见底了。第二天，他们穿上干净的衣服准备离开人间。
    ６月４日，船员们仰卧在船板上，等着上帝将他们召去。谁知就在这个夜晚，天空乌云密布，又下雨了。水桶积满了水，船员们个个喝得肚子鼓鼓的。这样，他们又可坚持下去了。
    ６月１４日下午，贡萨雷斯从正前方看到了一只白色金枪鱼捕捞船。站在驾驶台上的人用望远镜看见了“开罗—Ⅲ”号。贡萨雷斯实在按捺不住激动的心情，跳下海里，向那只船游去。不久，日本渔船把５名哥斯达黎加渔民接到船上。此时，他们离檀香山只有１１２６公里了。一周后，他们乘坐飞机回到了哥斯达黎加首都圣约瑟。
    这条小木渔船在海上先后漂流了１４２天，漂流了５７６０公里，这在世界航海史上还属首创。
