	China's annual mineral ore extraction has reached 1.7 billion tons, ranking third in the world. However, the resource recovery rate is lower than that of developed countries.

	According to a report from the State Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources, China's mineral development has already formed a considerable scale. The annual extraction of mineral ores has reached over 1.7 billion tons, which is 40 times the amount before the founding of the People's Republic, ranking third in the world.

	Although China's mining industry is thriving, resource wastage is also severe. In collective and individual mining operations, there are widespread instances of reckless and unregulated mining. The resource utilization rate in state-owned mines is also very low. According to statistics from over 3,000 state-owned mines in 1986, China's overall resource recovery rate is 10-20% lower than that of developed countries.

　　我年采矿石十七亿吨  产量跃居世界第三位
    资源回收率低于发达国家
    本报讯  记者朱剑红报道：据国家地质矿产部透露，我国矿产开发已形成较大的规模。年采掘矿石量达１７亿多吨，是建国前的４０倍，居世界第三位。
    虽然我国采矿业繁荣，但资源破坏浪费也很严重。集体、个体采矿中乱采滥挖现象十分普遍，国营矿山资源利用率很低。据１９８６年３０００多个国营矿的统计，我国资源总回收率比发达国家低１０—２０％。
