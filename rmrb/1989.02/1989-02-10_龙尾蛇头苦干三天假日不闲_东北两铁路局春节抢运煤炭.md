From the end of the Year of the Dragon to the third day of the Year of the Snake, the two railway bureaus in Northeast China used just three days to allocate nearly 10,000 empty cars and rushed to transport 460,000 tons of coal.

The vast number of workers from the Shenyang and Harbin railway bureaus took advantage of the Spring Festival period when passenger traffic was relatively light and some passenger trains were temporarily suspended. They seized every opportunity to arrange and open additional freight trains. After a large amount of coal was transported out, the coal reserves in various power plants increased, and the coal supply situation for major enterprises such as Anshan Iron and Steel Company, the First Automobile Works in Changchun, and the Daqing Oil Field was somewhat eased.

The two railway bureaus had already formulated a plan for transporting coal during the Spring Festival soon after the Spring Festival transportation began and made detailed arrangements. The Harbin Railway Bureau, which is responsible for transporting coal from the Jixi, Qitaihe, Shuangyashan, and Hetian coal mines, faced a shortage of empty cars. The Shenyang Railway Bureau, considering the overall situation, was willing to transport less coal itself and allocated empty cars from marshalling yards with large unloading volumes such as Jinzhou and Shenyang, directly to the Harbin Railway Bureau. The Harbin Railway Bureau also opened long-distance direct trains to speed up the turnover of vehicles.

　　龙尾蛇头苦干三天假日不闲
　　东北两铁路局春节抢运煤炭
    据新华社长春２月９日电  （记者陈广俊）记者从驻在长春的东北内蒙古煤炭工业联合公司获悉，从龙年除夕到蛇年初三，东北两铁路局仅用３天时间，调剂近万辆车皮，抢运煤炭４６万多吨。
    沈阳、哈尔滨两铁路局广大职工，利用春节期间旅客较少，部分客车暂时停运的空隙时间，见缝插针巧安排，加开货物列车。大量煤炭得到外运后，各电厂库存煤有所增加，鞍山钢铁公司、长春第一汽车制造厂、大庆油田等大企业用煤紧张的状况有所缓解。
    两铁路局早在春运开始不久，就制订了春节期间旅客急骤下降后的运煤方案，并做了周密的布置。担任鸡西、七台河、双鸭山、鹤岗矿务局运输任务的哈尔滨铁路局，空车不足，沈阳铁路局顾全大局，宁肯自己少装车，从锦州、沈阳等卸车量较大的编组站调剂空车，直通哈尔滨铁路局。哈尔滨铁路局还加开了远程直达列车，加速了车辆周转。
