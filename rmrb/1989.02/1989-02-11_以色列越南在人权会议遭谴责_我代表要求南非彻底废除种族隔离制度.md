The 45th session of the United Nations Human Rights Commission, which began on January 30, has concluded its discussions on two major issues: "Human Rights Violations in the Arab Occupied Territories, Including Palestine" and "The Right to Self-Determination of Peoples." After more than a week of debates, many countries' representatives have condemned the human rights violations committed by Israel and Vietnam.

The Palestinian representative, while exposing Israel's actions, emphasized that Israel's blatant violations of human rights in the Arab territories it occupies "constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity." He urged the Human Rights Commission to take necessary measures.

Egypt and other Arab countries' representatives condemned Israel's policies and human rights violations, calling on the international community to pressure Israel to change its stance. Many representatives expressed support for the just struggles of the Palestinian people and other Arab nations. They stressed that only by withdrawing Israeli troops from the Arab territories occupied since 1967 and restoring the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, including the right to self-determination, the right to return home, and the right to establish their own state, can the Palestinian issue be truly resolved.

Regarding the Cambodian issue, the Greek representative emphasized that Vietnam's military occupation of Cambodia is a flagrant violation of basic principles of international law.

The representative of Democratic Kampuchea condemned the Vietnamese authorities for obstructing a political solution to the Cambodian issue and rejecting the five-point peace proposal made by Prince Sihanouk on November 27 of the previous year. He reiterated that the Cambodian people would not accept a "Vietnamese-style peace," as it is a peace where "Cambodian national independence and the self-determination of the Cambodian people cannot be fully restored."

Representatives from Sweden and other countries demanded that Vietnamese troops withdraw from Cambodia as soon as possible, allowing the Cambodian people to truly exercise their right to determine their own future.

The 45th session of the Human Rights Commission is currently discussing the issue of human rights violations in South Africa. The session is scheduled to end on March 10.

The deputy leader of the Chinese delegation to the 45th session of the United Nations Human Rights Commission, Chen Shiqiu, strongly demanded on February 9 that the South African authorities follow the historical trend and completely abolish the apartheid system and policies of racial discrimination, and stop the brutal suppression of the broad masses of black people.

In his speech at the plenary session, he called on the international community to coordinate efforts and take more effective sanctions against South Africa to force it to change its policies.

　　以色列越南在人权会议遭谴责    
    我代表要求南非彻底废除种族隔离制度
    新华社日内瓦２月８日电  （记者向奎观）联合国人权委员会４５届会议自１月３０日开幕以来，经过一周多的辩论，结束了对“包括巴勒斯坦在内的阿拉伯被占领土上人权遭受侵犯”和“各国人民自决权”这两个重要议题的审议。许多国家代表发言谴责以色列和越南当局侵犯人权的行为。
    巴勒斯坦代表在揭露以色列当局时强调指出，以色列在其占领的阿拉伯领土上肆无忌惮侵犯人权的行为“已构成战争罪、戕害人类罪”。他呼吁人权委员会为此采取必要措施。
    埃及和其它阿拉伯国家代表谴责以色列的政策和侵犯人权的行为，要求国际社会对以色列施加压力，迫使它改弦易辙。许多国家代表在发言中表示对巴勒斯坦人民和其它阿拉伯国家人民正义斗争的支持。他们强调，只有以色列军队撤出自１９６７年以来被占的阿拉伯领土，恢复巴勒斯坦人民的合法权利，包括民族自决权、返回家园权和建立自己国家的权利，巴勒斯坦问题才能得到真正解决。
    在柬埔寨问题上，希腊代表强调，越南军事占领柬埔寨是明目张胆违反国际法基本原则。
    民主柬埔寨代表谴责越南当局阻挠政治解决柬埔寨问题，拒绝接受去年１１月２７日西哈努克亲王提出的５点和平建议。他重申，柬埔寨人民决不接受“越南式的和平”，因为这是一种“柬埔寨民族独立和柬埔寨人民的自决权不能得到彻底恢复的和平”。
    瑞典等国家的代表要求越南军队尽快撤出柬埔寨，使柬埔寨人民能真正行使自由地决定自己未来的权利。
    人权委员会第４５届会议目前正在审议南非侵犯人权的议题。会议将于３月１０日结束。
    新华社日内瓦２月９日电　出席联合国人权委员会第４５届会议的中国代表团副团长陈士球９日强烈要求南非当局顺应历史潮流，彻底废除种族隔离制度和种族歧视政策，停止对广大黑人群众的残酷镇压。
    他在大会上发言时呼吁国际社会协调一致，共同努力，对南非采取更加有效的制裁措施，迫使其改变政策。
