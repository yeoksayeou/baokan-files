Title: The Secret Lies in the Parentheses

Certain regulations on financial discipline in an organization state: “It is mandatory to strictly implement the central government’s regulations on controlled commodities. Any commodities purchased in violation of these regulations will not be reimbursed.” The statement is clear, and implementation should be straightforward. However, a parenthesis is added at the end of this sentence: (special circumstances excepted).

In the integrity agreement of a certain unit, there is a clause: “From now on, no tobacco or alcohol will be served at banquets for guests, and fees will be collected according to regulations.” A parenthesis is also added at the end: (special circumstances excepted).

The central government has repeatedly emphasized regulations on tightening expenditures, but why do some units still violate these rules? The answer can be found in these parentheses. Some people outwardly support these regulations, but if you carefully examine the meaning within the parentheses, you can easily see the loopholes.

The so-called “special” and “exceptions” that these people refer to are actually backdoors they leave for themselves to violate the regulations. The rules and regulations they establish are merely for show, meant to deceive superiors and subordinates. It is recommended that relevant leading departments, when inspecting work, should also examine the secrets hidden in the parentheses.

　　秘密全在括号里
　　艺良
    某机关制定的财经纪律有这么一条：“必须严格执行中央关于专控商品的有关规定，凡违反规定购买的商品，一律不予报销。”话很清楚，执行就是了，可偏偏在这句话后面加了一个括号：（特殊情况例外）。
    某单位廉政公约上有这么一条：“今后招待客饭一律不摆烟酒，并按规定收费。”后面也加了一个括号：（特殊情况例外）。
    中央关于紧缩开支的规定三令五申，有些单位为何屡禁不止？从这些括号里不难找出答案。有些人对这些规定表面上坚决拥护，但只要仔细品品括号里的含意，就很容易看出破绽。
    这些人的所谓“特殊”“例外”，其实是给自己违反规定留条后路，他们制定的规章制度也就成了欺上瞒下的应景之作。建议有关领导部门检查工作，不妨查一查括号里的秘密。
