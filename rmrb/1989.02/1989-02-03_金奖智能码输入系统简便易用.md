The electronic computer Chinese character input system, which was once considered difficult to learn and master, now has an intuitive and convenient method. Beginners do not need training; they can open the machine and start using it immediately. Illiterates can pass the national illiteracy elimination exam in just 33 days, and children as young as five or six can recognize over 1,600 Chinese characters after using it for a month. This input system is called the "Golden Award Intelligent Code."

This was reported by the reporter Mùyǎ at the product exhibition held by the Beijing Jinghai Group today.

The Chinese character input system invented by Fú Liáng uses a scheme of "character-based, word-oriented, sound and shape combined, intelligent processing." One of its features is fast input speed, with a rate of over 200 characters per minute. Additionally, it has multiple input functions and a wide range of applications. Those who do not know Pinyin can look up the Pinyin by the character's radical, just like using a dictionary. Those who do not speak Mandarin can also quickly type the correct Chinese characters based on their dialect pronunciation.

This system has won multiple gold medals at national and international invention exhibitions.

　　金奖智能码输入系统简便易用
    本报北京２月２日讯  记者木雅报道：一向被认为难于学习和掌握的电子计算机汉字输入系统，如今有了直观简便的方式，初学者无需培训，打开机器试试就会用，文盲仅用３３天即可通过国家脱盲考试，五六岁的幼儿使用一个月能识１６００多个汉字。这种输入系统叫做“金奖智能码”。
    这是记者在北京京海集团今天召开的产品展示会上获悉的。
    由扶良文发明的这一汉字输入系统采用“字为基础、词为主导、音形结合、智能处理”的方案。其特点之一是，输入速度快，每分钟可达２００多字；其次，它的输入功能多，适用面广。不会拼音的人可根据字的部首查拼音，如同使用字典。不会普通话的人，根据方言的读音也能迅速打出正确的汉字。
    该系统曾在全国及国际发明博览会上多次获得金牌奖。
