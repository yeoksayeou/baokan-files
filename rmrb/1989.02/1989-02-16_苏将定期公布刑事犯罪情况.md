The Soviet Ministry of Internal Affairs will from now on periodically release information on domestic criminal offenses to the Soviet press, thus ending the practice of keeping such data secret since 1933.

The *Izvestia* reported that on the 14th, Smirnov, the director of the Soviet Ministry of Internal Affairs News Center, held a press conference and released relevant figures on criminal offenses in the Soviet Union last year.

Smirnov said that last year, 1,867,223 criminal offenses were recorded, an increase of 68,700 cases compared to the previous year. There were 657.1 criminal offenses per 100,000 people, an increase of 17.8% compared to the previous year. Among the republics, Latvia had the highest crime rate, with 864.9 criminal offenses per 100,000 people. Smirnov pointed out that by publicizing the crime situation, more people can be mobilized to fight against criminal phenomena.

　　苏将定期公布刑事犯罪情况
    苏联内务部从现在起定期向苏联新闻界公布国内刑事犯罪情况，从而结束自一九三三年以来对这类资料保密的做法。
    《消息报》报道，苏联内务部新闻中心主任斯米尔诺夫十四日举行记者招待会，公布了苏联去年犯罪情况的有关数字。
    斯米尔诺夫说，去年登记在案的犯罪行为一百八十六万七千二百二十三起，比前年增加六点八七万起。每十万居民有六百五十七点一起犯罪行为，比前年增百分之十七点八。各共和国中，拉脱维亚犯罪率最高，每十万居民有八百六十四点九起。斯米尔诺夫指出，把犯罪情况公布于众，是为了动员更多的人同犯罪现象作斗争。
