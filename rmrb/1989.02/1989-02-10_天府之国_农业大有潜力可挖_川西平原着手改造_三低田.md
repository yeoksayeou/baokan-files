	The Land of Abundance Has Great Potential for Agricultural Development
	The Sichuan Basin Begins to Transform "Three-Low Fields"

	CHENGDU, Feb. 9 (Xinhua) — Last December, Chengdu Municipal Committee Secretary Wu Xihai and Vice Mayor Liu Jiazhong spent a month investigating rural areas and confirmed that the heartland of the "Land of Abundance" still has potential for increased grain production. The Municipal Committee and Government have since begun drafting plans to boost grain production, determined to achieve the highest historical annual yield.

	Over the past five years, Chengdu's grain production has stagnated. As a high-yield grain-producing area with high land utilization, is there still potential for increased production? Through investigations, municipal leaders discovered that vast areas of hills and mountains have not been fully developed, and even in the plain areas, there are many "three-low fields." Large-scale transformation of "three-low fields" offers great hope for increased grain production.

	According to investigations, Chengdu currently has 1.67 million mu of low-yield fields, including 1 million mu of waterlogged fields, accounting for one-fifth of the existing paddy fields. Facts have proven that transforming low-yield fields is feasible. Jinma Township in Wenjiang County, with unified planning by the county and implementation by the township, repaired a 5.5-kilometer-long main canal in just over 20 days, transforming 4,000 mu of waterlogged fields into stable, high-yield fields. Xinmin Township in Pidu County has 3,000 mu of "muddy fields" where farmers had to plant rice seedlings while standing on bamboo poles and harvest rice while stepping on rice straw. Last October, the township mobilized over 50,000 laborers to dig nearly 10,000 meters of open and closed ditches in a month and a half, transforming this waterlogged field into a place for growing wheat and rapeseed. According to investigations, after transformation, waterlogged fields can be converted from one season to two seasons, with an average increase of 150 kilograms of grain per mu. Chengdu plans to transform 200,000 mu of waterlogged fields each year, completing the transformation of 1 million mu of waterlogged fields in five years, increasing grain production by 150 million kilograms per year.

	Additionally, the city has over 400,000 mu of drought-prone low-yield fields due to water shortages, and the effects of transformation are significant. Xilaixi and Gaojiao Townships in Pujian County invested over 600,000 yuan and mobilized over 30,000 laborers from September to November last year to transform 4.1 kilometers of irrigation ditches, irrigating 3,000 mu of dry fields. Baima Village in Peng County's Xijiao Township drilled four wells, solving the irrigation problem for hundreds of mu of dry fields during the rice transplanting season. According to statistics from Qionglai County, after transformation, each mu of dry field can increase grain production by at least 25 kilograms. Furthermore, there are some low-yield fields farmed by workers and merchants, especially in suburban areas. A township in Peng County implemented a policy where those who do not farm well cannot work in township enterprises, resulting in not only young people working hard to farm well but also their parents helping out.

### “天府之国”农业大有潜力可挖　川西平原着手改造“三低田”

　　“天府之国”农业大有潜力可挖
　　川西平原着手改造“三低田”
    本报成都电  记者罗茂城报道：去年底，成都市委书记吴希海、副市长刘家忠等同志深入农村调查一个月，确认“天府之国”的腹心地带也有增产粮食潜力可挖。市委、市政府根据调查情况，目前已着手制订增产粮食的计划，决心为达到历史最高年产而努力。
    近５年来，成都市粮食产量出现徘徊局面。成都是粮食高产区，土地利用率也较高，在这种情况下，粮食产量还有无潜力可挖？市委、市政府领导通过调查发现，全市尚有广大的丘陵和山区没有得到充分开发，就是在平原坝区，也有不少“三低田”。大力改造“三低田”，增产粮食大有希望。
    据调查，目前成都市现有“下湿田”、“旱角田”和“应付田”等低产田１６７万亩，其中下湿田１００万亩，占现有水田的１／５。事实也证明，改造低产田切实可行。温江县金马乡，由县里统一规划，乡上组织实施，仅用２０余天整修了５．５公里长的干渠，使４０００亩下湿田改造成稳产高产的良田。郫县新民乡有３０００亩“骑着扁担栽秧，踩着稻草割谷”的“烂潮田”，过去产量很低。去年１０月，该乡投工５万多个，用一个半月修成明、暗沟近万米，使这片下湿田得到改造，种上了小麦和油菜。据调查，改造后的下湿田，当年就可变一季为两季，每亩平均增产粮食１５０公斤左右。成都市计划每年改造下湿田２０万亩，５年改造完１００万亩下湿田，一年可增产１．５亿公斤粮食。
    其次，全市有４０余万亩由于缺水造成的旱角低产田，通过改造，增产效果显著。蒲江县西来乡、高桥乡，去年９月至１１月，自筹资金６万多元，投入劳力３万多个，改造斗渠４．１公里，使３０００亩旱田得到灌溉。彭县西郊乡白马村打井４口，解决了该村几百亩旱田水稻插秧期的用水。据邛崃县统计，改造后的旱田，每亩至少可增产２５公斤粮食。另外，还有少数务工经商的农民种的应付低产田，在城郊尤甚。彭县有个乡采取凡种不好田者不能到乡村企业当工人的措施，结果不仅青年人努力种好田，连他们的父母也帮忙下功夫。
