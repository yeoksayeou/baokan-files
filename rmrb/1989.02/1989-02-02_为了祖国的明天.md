Recently, at the 31st "Future Master" exhibition held in Leipzig, over 2,400 exhibits showcased the fruitful achievements of East German youth in the fields of science and technology. For example, a 26-year-old young scientist, Kirsten Latgen, invented a biotechnology processing method that can produce nucleic acids at a world-class level, generating an annual profit of 100,000 Marks. The "Future Master" collective of the Ruhla Watch Combine invented a quartz watch assembly system that can freely encode and modify programs, saving 16 laborers on the entire assembly line...

"The Future Master" is a nationwide activity organized by the Free German Youth League, aimed at encouraging youth in scientific and technological innovation, mobilizing young people to actively learn advanced scientific and technological knowledge, and striving to become "Future Masters" to contribute more to socialist construction.

Youth are the hope of the motherland and a vital force in socialist construction. In addition to "Future Master," the Youth League organizes activities such as youth shock brigades, youth research collectives, and youth projects. According to East German comrades, there are currently 45,000 youth shock brigades composed of young people under 25 years old, totaling 500,000 members. Under the guidance of experienced craftsmen, they undertake many important tasks within enterprises. Additionally, there are 5,000 youth research collectives dedicated to scientific and technological research to improve labor productivity. Young people also independently undertake many engineering construction projects, known as "youth projects."

The Free German Youth League is not only an organizer of youth but also a large school. Through lively, rich, and varied activities, the Youth League conducts political and ideological education for young people, which is a regular task of the Youth League.

The Youth League Study Year is an activity with a history of over 30 years, helping young people systematically learn Marxism-Leninism and the party's policies. East German youth are very interested in domestic and international affairs, such as the signing of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty between the Soviet Union and the United States and the ceasefire between Iran and Iraq. In many East German enterprises, you can see the slogan "The workplace is a position to struggle for peace." This slogan has become the guiding principle for young people.

East German youth are willing to express their views. The publications sponsored by the Youth League serve as their forum. The "Young World" newspaper often organizes discussions on issues of interest to young people, with enthusiastic participation. In late September of last year, the newspaper initiated a discussion on the theme "I am 14 years old" based on readers' suggestions, posing four questions: "What is most important in your life?" "Why do you want to join the Youth League?" and so on. As a result, over 1,300 letters were received in seven weeks.

The Youth League believes that the glorious revolutionary traditions of the older generation must be inherited and carried forward by the younger generation. Therefore, it is important for young people to understand history and traditions. The Youth League frequently organizes various traditional education activities, such as holding commemorative meetings and evenings on various anniversaries, and publishing articles in newspapers and magazines introducing the deeds of revolutionary predecessors. This is also beneficial for mutual understanding between the old and new generations. The reporter once asked Roland Krause, one of the leaders of the Youth League Central Committee, whether there is a "generation gap" in East Germany. He replied: "The interests and hobbies of the young generation and the older generation are different, but their ideals are completely consistent. Therefore, it cannot be said that young people only care about fashion, while the older generation only cares about work." He added that young people like rock music, and older people also like it.

In East Germany, the influence of the West on youth is a topic often discussed. Indeed, East Germany is located at the junction of the East and West, and the influence of the West is certainly not negligible. The Youth League has noticed this problem and often educates young people on how to correctly handle Western propaganda. Comrade Krause pointed out: "We have been living in this situation for 40 years. It is not easy, but we are becoming stronger and stronger."

　　“为了祖国的明天”
    本报记者  许宏治
    不久前在莱比锡举行的民德第３１届“明天的师傅”展览上，２４００多件展品显示了民德青年在科技创造发明方面的丰硕成果。例如，２６岁的青年科研工作者克尔斯丁·拉特根发明的一项生物工程处理方法，可生产出具有世界先进水平的核酸，每年可创造利润１０万马克。鲁拉钟表联合企业“明天的师傅”集体发明的一种石英表装配系统，可随意编制和改变程序，全套流水线可节省１６个劳动力……
    “明天的师傅”是自由德国青年联盟组织的一项全国性活动，目的在于鼓励青年的科技发明活动，动员青年积极学习先进科技知识，争当“明天的师傅”，为社会主义建设多作贡献。
    青年是祖国的希望，在社会主义建设中是一支生力军。青盟组织的活动，除“明天的师傅”外，还有青年突击队、青年研究者集体、青年工程，等等。据民德同志介绍，现在民德企业中有４.５万个由２５岁以下青年组成的“青年突击队”，共５０万人。他们在老师傅带领下，担负着企业中的许多重要任务。另外，有５０００个“青年研究者集体”，致力于提高劳动生产率的科技研究活动。青年们还独力承担许多工程建设项目，称为“青年工程”。
    自由德国青年联盟不仅是青年的组织者，而且是一所大学校。通过生动活泼、丰富多采的活动，对青年进行政治思想教育，是青盟的经常性工作。
    青盟学习年，是一项已有３０多年历史的活动，是青盟帮助青年系统地学习马列主义和党的方针政策的一种行之有效的方式。民德青年对国内外大事非常关心，如苏美签署中导协议、两伊停火等国际重大事件，青年们都很感兴趣。在民德许多企业都可以看到“工作岗位就是为争取和平而奋斗的岗位”的标语。这一口号已成为青年们的行动指南。
    民德青年是乐于发表自己的观点的。青盟主办的报刊就是他们的论坛。《青年世界报》经常就青年们感兴趣的问题组织讨论，参加者十分踊跃。去年９月下旬，该报根据读者建议，发起以《我今年１４岁了》为主题的讨论，提出了“你生活中最重要的是什么？”“你为什么想加入青盟？”等４个问题。结果在７个星期内收到１３００多件来稿。
    青盟组织认为，老一辈的光荣革命传统要由年轻一代继承和发扬，因此，让青年了解历史、了解传统非常重要。青盟经常举办各种传统教育活动，如每逢各种纪念日举行有关的纪念会、晚会等，报刊杂志也经常发表介绍老一辈革命者事迹的文章。这对新老两代人之间的相互理解也是有益的。记者曾经问过青盟中央负责人之一罗兰·克劳斯，在民德是否存在“代沟”的问题？他回答说：“青年一代和老一代有不同的兴趣爱好，但他们的理想是完全一致的。因此不能说青年们只关心时装，老一辈才关心工作。”他又补充说，像摇滚乐之类，年轻人喜欢，老年人也喜欢。
    在民德，西方对青年的影响是人们常常谈到的一个问题。的确，民主德国地处东西方交界之处，西方的影响当然是不可忽视的。青盟注意到了这个问题，经常教育青年，如何正确对待西方的宣传。克劳斯同志指出：“我们在这种情况下已经生活了４０年。我们不容易，但我们正在变得越来越强大。”
