	Chongqing city and its suburbs have seen the majority of temples equipped with telephones. A telephone line connects the tranquil temples with the outside world, allowing "monks" to handle affairs without leaving the temple. The abbot of Tushan Temple, Zheng Yong, said that using the telephone to communicate makes things much more convenient.

	In Tianjin, retired elderly workers and some young people from Anhui and Shandong who have come to Tianjin to work have recently entered the "nanny" profession, which has traditionally been dominated by women. These popular male nannies are hired by families or units to take care of and accompany patients, earning around 150 yuan per month.

	To provide economic security for the elderly in rural "daughter households," more than a hundred "daughter household funds" have emerged in Wenzhou, Zhejiang. The government and the daughter households contribute 300 to 500 yuan each, with the government contributing 90% and the households 10%, to be deposited in a credit union. The interest earned will be used to support the household head when they reach retirement age.

	In Hupo Village, Zhushicheng Town, Dongkou County, Hunan Province, there is an ancient well that has accurately predicted the weather for nearly a decade. The well water is usually clear and transparent, but a few days before a heavy rain, the water turns brownish-red and has a bitter taste. After four hours, it returns to its clear state.

　　重庆寺院装电话　方便出家人  天津男士当保姆　侍候病残者
    ●重庆市区、近郊的寺庙，目前绝大多数已安装了电话。一根电话线将静穆的寺庙与外界连接起来，“出家人”不出庙就可以办事。涂山寺住持正勇说，用电话联系工作方便多了。

    ●天津市的退休老工人和一些从安徽、山东到天津做工的年轻人，最近挤进了向来由女性一统天下的“保姆”行列。这些“吃香”的男保姆受雇于一些家庭或单位，专门伺候、陪伴病人，每月可收入１５０元左右。

    ●为了给农村女儿户的养老提供经济保障，浙江温州市出现百多个“女儿户基金会”。政府和女儿户按９∶１的比例一次性出资３００至５００元存入信用社，以复利计算，户主到了退休年龄时，吃利息便可养老。

    ●湖南省洞口县竹市镇荷池村，有一口近十年来报气象无一失误的古井。井水平常清亮透明，但每逢下大雨前一两天，井水变为棕红色，且有苦涩味，４小时后复清。
