The Ministry of Light Industry is taking serious action in its "supporting the best and restricting the worst" campaign. In a recent report on the quality of light industrial products in 1988, the ministry publicly exposed a batch of substandard products that have harmed consumers.

The report highlights several issues with the quality of light industrial products in 1988:

1. **Substandard Refrigerators from Non-designated Factories Entering the Market, Harming Consumers**: Brands such as "Rizhi," "Lezhi," "Risi," "San A," "Aokai," "Lili," "Huaxing," "Kangwu," "Hangsheng," "Kuaile," "Risheng," "Risheng," "Jingying," "Meida," "Xiaobao," "Huabao," "Tongbao," "Dani Fugen," and "Luolansi" are among the substandard products. Most of these refrigerators are produced in Zhejiang Province and Hangzhou City. These assembly plants have poor equipment and rough manufacturing processes, lacking the necessary production conditions. The quality of their products is poor, and most lack maintenance networks, seriously harming consumer interests.

2. **False Advertisements Promoting Substandard Products**: Products such as multifunctional home weaving machines, electronic height-increasing devices, vision correction instruments, learning and memory enhancers, electric fishing machines, powerful beauty spot removers, hair growth products, and simple cold-hot shower devices have been advertised falsely through television, radio, newspapers, and magazines, deceiving many consumers.

3. **Failure to Implement "Three Guarantees" (Repair, Replacement, Refund), Failing to Protect Consumer Interests**: Last year, the prices of refrigerators increased significantly, and products frequently had quality issues. Some enterprises and dealers did not repair or replace defective products, causing consumers to suffer losses.

4. **Food and Beverage Quality Seriously Endangering Personal Health**: The quality of milk powder produced in many places has declined, and some milk sellers adulterate fresh milk. About half of the small breweries have poor hygiene conditions, and their products do not meet quality standards. The Guanyin Palace Food Factory in Guiyang produced 2,000 kilograms of moon cakes that did not meet hygiene standards, causing over a thousand people to become poisoned. Many regions produce biscuits and instant noodles that spoil and change flavor within their shelf life. Some fruit juice beverages lack ingredient lists, factory names and addresses, and expiration dates, providing opportunities for substandard products to enter the market.

The Ministry of Light Industry requires all levels of light industry departments to strengthen product quality inspections; to rectify enterprises with unstable quality; and to work with relevant departments to order the shutdown of refrigerator factories that lack production conditions and cannot guarantee product quality.

### 轻工部“扶优限劣”动了真格的  一批产品鱼目混珠被公布于众

　　轻工部“扶优限劣”动了真格的   
    一批产品鱼目混珠被公布于众
    本报讯  记者刘桂蓬报道：轻工业部在“扶优限劣”中动真格的。在日前发布的１９８８年轻工产品质量公报中，毫不留情地把一批坑害消费者利益的伪劣产品公布于众。
    轻工部在产品质量公报中列举１９８８年轻工产品质量存在的问题有：
    一、非定点企业生产的劣质电冰箱流入市场，坑害消费者。“日芝”、“乐芝”、“日四星”、“三Ａ”、“奥卡”、“丽丽”、“华星”、“康武”、“杭生”、“快乐”、“日升”、“日声”、“晶莹”、“美达”、“夏宝”、“华宝”、“通宝”、“丹尼福根”、“罗兰斯宝”等劣质产品，产地大多集中在浙江省、杭州市。这些电冰箱装配厂，设备简陋，工艺粗糙，根本不具备生产条件，产品质量低劣，大多没有维修网点，严重损害了消费者利益。
    二、刊登虚假广告，推销劣质产品。例如多功能家用编织机、人体电子增高器、视力矫正仪、学习记忆增强器、电捕鱼机、强力特效美容雀斑露、黑发灵、简易冷热水淋浴器等一批劣质产品，利用电视、电台、报刊、杂志刊登虚假广告，许多人受骗上当。
    三、产品“三包”不落实，消费者利益得不到保障。去年电冰箱价格上涨幅度大，产品经常发生质量问题，有的企业和经销单位不修不换，使消费者蒙受损失。
    四、食品和饮料质量严重危害人身健康。不少地方生产的奶粉质量下降，牛奶销售户在鲜奶中掺假。小啤酒厂约有一半卫生条件差，质量达不到标准。贵阳广寒宫食品厂生产的２０００公斤月饼不合卫生标准，致使上千人中毒。不少地区生产的饼干、方便面在保存期内变质变味。果汁饮料外包装有的没有配料表，没有厂名厂址，没有保存期限，这些都给劣质产品上市提供了可乘之机。
    轻工部要求各级轻工部门加强对产品质量的检查；对于质量不稳定的企业要整顿；对不具备生产条件、产品质量得不到保证的电冰箱厂，要配合有关部门责令其停产。
