The long-awaited "Round Table Conference" in Poland began on February 6. This is a major event in Poland's domestic political life, marking an important step toward national reconciliation and domestic stability.

The convening of the "Round Table Conference" is directly related to the recent Central Committee Plenum of the Polish United Workers' Party. The Plenum made two important decisions: first, to carry out a thorough reform of the Party itself, so that it can effectively play its role in Poland's pluralistic society and socialist market economy; second, to adopt a document on political and trade union pluralism, recognizing the necessity and possibility of including the "constructive opposition" within Poland's political system. The Party is prepared to engage in dialogue with the "constructive opposition" and explore forms of mutual understanding, and has announced the lifting of restrictions on the establishment of new trade unions under conditions of national reconciliation. These decisions by the Plenum have been widely welcomed by various sectors of Polish society. The former National Executive Committee of Solidarity expressed its willingness to place national interests above any narrow self-interest, in accordance with the law and trade union statutes.

The proposal to hold the "Round Table Conference" was made by Poland's Interior Minister Kiszczak in August of last year, following the wave of strikes in Poland. The aim was to seek the participation of various sectors of society in discussions with the authorities on a series of major national issues, in order to reach a consensus. Lech Wałęsa had expressed his support. However, due to sharp differences of opinion on the participants and the content of the discussions, the conference had not been convened. In essence, the crux of the matter was whether to allow Solidarity to exist legally. The Plenum's decision to lift restrictions on the establishment of new trade unions effectively laid the groundwork for the legalization of Solidarity, thereby clearing the way for the "Round Table Conference."

As Polish Prime Minister Rakowski pointed out, the crisis that erupted in Poland in the early 1980s was essentially a public rejection of the socialist system that had been in place for over 30 years. The Polish Party and government were forced onto the path of reform under immense pressure from the masses. The first few years of reform achieved some results. However, the second phase of reforms, implemented from the beginning of last year, encountered serious setbacks from the outset. The second-phase reform plan, which was not approved in the nationwide referendum held at the end of 1987, essentially indicated that the masses lacked the capacity to bear the large-scale reforms in prices and wages. In this situation, the Polish authorities hastily made some modifications to the plan and continued to push forward with the price-income policy, resulting in another serious economic and political crisis.

The Polish Party has drawn lessons from the failure of the second phase of reforms and reflected deeply on the causes of the crisis, recognizing that the failure of the price-income policy was largely due to the lack of broad social support, insufficient consideration of the views of various strata of the population, and the implementation of some measures without regard to the people's capacity to bear them, coupled with the lack of complementary measures, resulting in a loss of control and an irreparable serious situation, causing public discontent.

Therefore, after Rakowski took office as Prime Minister, he stated that the first task of the new government was to win the trust of society. He pointed out that without the support of the people for the government's economic and social policies, even the most brilliant ideas and plans would inevitably fail. Over the past few months, the Party and the government have been making continuous efforts to achieve national reconciliation and domestic stability.

The Central Committee Plenum was held against this background. Jaruzelski pointed out at the meeting that the fundamental way out for Poland lies in making socialism modern, a socialism that can guarantee the people's life under broad democratic conditions. In a broadly democratized society, the "constructive opposition" should also have a place. The Party itself must set an example for democratization. The Party should not exert influence through administrative intervention, but through its political ideology and political quality. The Party should be most concerned about becoming detached from the masses and standing aloof. These ideas were accepted by the Plenum.

After heated debates, the Plenum made major decisions on fundamental issues such as political and trade union pluralism, thereby making the convening of the "Round Table Conference" possible. This played a crucial role in promoting national reconciliation and domestic stability in Poland. However, public opinion believes that finding a way out of the crisis does not mean that the crisis has been overcome. Although the Round Table Conference has begun, it can be predicted that the conference process will still be difficult. Problems accumulated over many years cannot be solved overnight.

However, although the debates are fierce, as relevant parties have said, as long as all parties can act from the fundamental interests of the state, national reconciliation and domestic stability are hopeful. Only by doing so can the reforms proceed smoothly; and only by carrying out thorough reforms can the crisis be fundamentally overcome, and the cause of Polish socialism be advanced.

### 迈向民族谅解的重要一步

　　迈向民族谅解的重要一步
    本报记者　许宏治
    酝酿已久的波兰“圆桌会议”已于２月６日开始举行。这是波兰国内政治生活中的一件大事，标志着向民族谅解和国内安定的方向迈出的重要一步。
    “圆桌会议”的得以开成，与不久前召开的波党十中全会有直接关系。十中全会作出了两项重要决定：一是对党本身进行深刻的改革，以便有效地发挥党在波兰多元化社会和社会主义市场经济条件下的作用；二是通过了关于政治多元化和工会多元化问题的文件，认为有必要并有可能把“建设性反对派”列入波兰政治制度范围内，党准备同“建设性反对派”进行对话，并探讨达成谅解的形式，并宣布在民族谅解情况下取消对成立新工会的限制。十中全会的这些决定受到波兰社会各界的广泛欢迎。前团结工会全国执委会表示，团结工会愿意依据法律和工会章程，把国家利益置于任何本位主义利益之上。
    召开“圆桌会议”是去年８月波兰发生工潮后由波兰内政部长基什查克提出的建议，目的在于争取社会各方面人士同当局共同讨论国家的一系列重大问题，以期取得一致意见。瓦文萨曾表示响应。但因双方在参加人员和讨论内容等问题上意见有尖锐分歧，一直没有开成。实际上，问题的焦点在于是否允许团结工会合法存在。十中全会决定取消对成立新工会的限制，实质上为团结工会的合法化提供了基础，这便为“圆桌会议”的举行扫清了道路。
    正如波兰总理拉科夫斯基所说，８０年代初波兰发生的危机实际上是人民对过去实行了３０多年的那种社会主义的公开抵制。波兰党和政府是在人民群众的巨大压力下走上改革道路的。改革的头几年取得了一定的效果。但是从去年年初开始实行的第二阶段改革却从一开始就遭到严重挫折。第二阶段改革方案在１９８７年年底前举行的全民公决中未获通过，实际上表明人民群众对物价、工资制度的大幅度改革缺乏承受能力。在这种情况下，波兰当局匆匆对方案作了些修改后，仍坚持推行价格—收入行动，结果再次引起了严重的经济和政治危机。
    波党对第二阶段改革的失败及时总结了经验教训，对危机产生的原因进行了深刻的反思，认识到“价格—收入”行动之所以失败，重要原因在于没有得到广泛的社会支持，没有充分考虑各阶层群众的意见，有些措施的实行没有考虑到群众的承受能力，再加上缺乏配套措施，孤军深入，结果失去控制，造成了不可收拾的严重后果，引起群众的不满。
    因此，拉科夫斯基就任总理后表示，新政府的第一个任务是赢得社会的信任。他指出，没有人民对政府经济和社会政策的支持，再出色的设想和计划也必然要遭到失败。几个月来，党和政府在谋求实现民族谅解和国内安定方面不断进行努力。
    波党十中全会便是在这样的背景下召开的。雅鲁泽尔斯基在会上指出，波兰的根本出路在于必须使社会主义具有现代化的面目，这种社会主义要能保证人民在广泛民主的条件下生活。在广泛民主化的社会里，“建设性反对派”也应拥有一席之地。而党本身必须为民主化作出榜样。党应该不是通过行政干预，而是以自己的政治思想、政治素质来发挥影响。党最应该担心的是脱离群众、高高在上。这些思想为全会所接受。
    十中全会经过激烈辩论后，就政治多元化、工会多元化等根本性问题作出了重大决策，从而使“圆桌会议”的举行得以实现。这对波兰实现民族谅解和国内安定起了关键性的推动作用。但是，舆论认为，找到摆脱危机的出路并不等于已经摆脱危机。圆桌会议虽然开始举行了，但可以预料，会议的过程仍将是艰难的。多年积累起来的问题不可能一下子得以解决。
    不过，争论虽然激烈，但正如有关人士说的，只要有关各方都能从国家根本利益出发，实现民族谅解和国内安定是有希望的。只有做到了这一点，改革才能顺利进行下去；而只有进行彻底的改革，才能从根本上摆脱危机，把波兰的社会主义事业推向前进。
