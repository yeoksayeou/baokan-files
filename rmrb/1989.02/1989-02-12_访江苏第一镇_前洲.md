Visiting Jiangsu's First Town: Qianzhou

By Reporters Li Jiguo and Sun Jian

We had long heard that Wuxi County's Qianzhou Town was Jiangsu's first town. Last year, the town's total industrial and agricultural output value reached 670 million yuan. At the beginning of the new year, we went to Qianzhou Town to conduct an interview.

			(One)

We had assumed that the economically prosperous and thriving Qianzhou Town, with its town party committee and town government, would necessarily have a grand exterior, a complete set of institutions, and a large number of personnel. However, upon arrival, we found it to be an ordinary two-story old building. On the second floor, there was only one person busily working (later we found out he was the party committee office director and secretary). The place was efficient and quiet, with none of the usual idlers or idle chatter.

The next day, town party committee secretary Yu Shunyuan introduced to us: "In recent years, Qianzhou Town's economic development and business expansion have not increased the number of town party and government officials. From the secretary and town mayor to the cooks, typists, and drivers, there are only 40 people, less than the number stipulated by the state. How did such a team form and operate?"

—Determine positions based on tasks and rationally allocate staff. Qianzhou Town started by sorting out work relationships and implemented a system where line work is mainly done by part-time staff, avoiding top-down correspondence. Based on the amount and difficulty of work, they allocated personnel rationally, assigning fewer full-time staff. Currently, the town government has only four functional departments: the party committee office, the military affairs department, the village and town office, and the financial bureau. The party committee office director also serves as the secretary. The party committee's organization, discipline inspection, and propaganda departments have only committee members, with no dedicated staff. Usually, each person handles their own tasks. For more significant tasks such as inspecting cadres or investigating cases, they are assigned and coordinated accordingly.

—Assign people based on positions and suitability. Over the years, within the town government, regardless of whether they are state cadres or hired cadres, whoever has the ability is used, and those who are not competent are dismissed on the spot.

—Authorize responsibilities and implement target management. Based on the allocation of positions and personnel, the eight members of the town party committee and the two deputy mayors each manage a line and are responsible for an area. Other personnel are responsible to one level, working independently within their scope and handling issues independently, enjoying full autonomy. At the same time, the town government fully implemented position target management, formulated regular summary and percentage assessment systems, and directly linked personal interests with work performance, strengthening the incentive mechanism and mobilizing the enthusiasm of government staff. Qianzhou Town's innovations were reported by the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee Office to the entire province.

Qianzhou Town's township enterprises are famous nationwide, but what is the status of its educational undertakings? What are the enrollment and retention rates of primary and secondary school students? This was our focus of the interview.

During our stay in Qianzhou Town, we visited the town's central kindergarten twice. This two-story building is not inferior to some of the more beautiful youth palaces in the city. No wonder the responsible comrades from the provincial Women's Federation said after their visit that the Qianzhou Town Central Kindergarten is one of the best in Jiangsu Province. The town invested nearly 10 million yuan to build this over 2,000 square meter central kindergarten. The kindergarten was completed and put into use in 1987, with the capacity to accommodate 8 classes and 400 children. Among the kindergarten teachers, 3 are graduates assigned from the kindergarten teacher training school.

We also visited Qianzhou Middle School. Deputy Principal Zhu Bendu said proudly, "Qianzhou Middle School has a history of 50 years. In the past, it was just a row of ordinary houses. The current Qianzhou Middle School has two teaching buildings and one experimental building, all newly built by the town in recent years. In front of the teaching buildings, there is a spacious football field and a spectator stand, the conditions are much improved. Qianzhou Middle School is a complete middle school, and the town has three junior middle schools; there is also one central primary school and 16 village primary schools. All school buildings have been completely renovated. The town has already achieved the nine-year compulsory education ahead of schedule. The enrollment rate and graduation rate of primary school students are both 100%; the enrollment rate of junior middle school students is 98.6%, and the graduation rate is 97%, both ranking at the top in the province. In addition, the town has a cadre management school (training enterprise leaders) and a worker technical school (training in-service workers), forming an educational network from preschool and primary and secondary schools to adult education and vocational education, providing and cultivating a large number of talents for township enterprises.

Qianzhou Town's educational undertakings are as prosperous and developed as its township enterprises because the town party committee and town government clearly realize that education is the foundation and hope for the continued development and improvement of the local economy and township enterprises. Therefore, in recent years, about one-third of the town's fiscal budget has been used for educational undertakings. For example, last year, the town's fiscal revenue was 30 million yuan, and 10 million yuan was used to improve the conditions for education and the living conditions of teachers. This does not include the investments in education by each village and enterprise. Education is valued, and teachers are respected. In Qianzhou Town, this has become a good social custom. We are happy for the foresight of the people of Qianzhou.

Qianzhou Town's industrial output value reached 659.26 million yuan last year, accounting for 97.7% of the total industrial and agricultural output value, with the agricultural output value being almost negligible. Remarkably, this town, with an average of only seven mu of land per person, has changed its history of relying on returned grain and has been contributing grain to the state since 1985, with an annual contribution of 4.3 million kilograms. Here, the more township enterprises develop, the more agricultural and sideline products are valued, the more village and town-level funds are supplemented for agriculture, and the higher the grain yield per mu becomes.

Located in the northwestern part of Wuxi City, Qianzhou Town has a low-lying and prone-to-flooding terrain. In 1970, it was the poorest of the 36 towns in Wuxi County. After more than a decade of struggle, the town has made significant achievements in agricultural water conservancy construction. Town party committee secretary Yu Shunyuan clearly stated: "Water conservancy construction is the mother of Qianzhou Town's enterprises." To change the backward appearance of Qianzhou, it is necessary to transform low-lying fields, and to transform low-lying fields, it is necessary to launch large-scale water conservancy projects: a total of 90 new rivers were opened, and more than 220 new bridges were built, which greatly promoted the rise and development of township and village industries. Now, Qianzhou Town's industrial company has more than 200 factories under its jurisdiction, producing over 500 kinds of products in machinery, textiles, light industry, metallurgy, and chemical industries, which are sold in 29 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country, enjoying a certain reputation. There are also a number of export products sold to more than 20 countries and regions, with strong competitiveness in the international market.

The secret to the rapid development of Qianzhou Town's township and village enterprises lies in their emphasis on accumulation and reinvestment in production, rather than high distribution and high consumption. Qianzhou's total industrial and agricultural output value ranks first in the county, but its consumption distribution level ranks fifth in the county. The average savings per person reach 1,000 yuan, totaling 37 million yuan. By the end of last year, the town and village-level collective fixed assets amounted to 1.5 billion yuan, and self-owned liquid funds amounted to 85 million yuan. In the current rectification and regulation, Qianzhou Town's enterprises have a significantly stronger self-regulation capability than other regions. This cannot be said to be the wisdom of the people of Qianzhou.

Qianzhou Town adheres to the principle of collective economy as the mainstay, township industry as the mainstay, and commodity production as the mainstay, taking the road to common prosperity. Not only does it contribute grain to the state every year, but it also contributes a large amount of taxes, reaching 23.46 million yuan last year alone. Economic prosperity, outstanding contributions, and good customs. The requirement of the Qianzhou Town Party Committee is: "Cadres lead the masses to get rich, cadres get rich among them." The cadres are indeed doing this, and thus have gained the support of the masses. The vanguard and model role of party members is increasingly prominent here, and the number of people applying to join the party is increasing. The party and socialism have appeal, attraction, and cohesion here.

　　访江苏第一镇——前洲
    本报记者  李济国  孙健
    早就听说，无锡县前洲镇是江苏第一镇。去年，这个镇的工农业总产值达到６．７亿元。新春伊始，我们慕名前往前洲镇采访。
    　　　　（一）
    原以为，经济繁荣、乡镇企业兴旺的前洲镇，它的镇党委和镇政府，必然是外表气派、机构齐全、人员众多的“大机关”，可实地一看，是一座普普通通的二层旧楼，在二楼办公室只有一人紧忙着（事后知道他是党委办公室主任兼秘书），这儿精干、清静，没有常见的闲人和闲谈。
    第二天，镇党委书记于顺源对我们介绍说：这几年前洲镇经济发展，事业扩大，但镇党政机关人员从未增加，从书记、镇长到炊事员、打字员、驾驶员，只有４０人，不到国家规定的人数。这样一个班子是怎样形成、运转的呢？
    ——以事定岗、合理定编。前洲镇从理顺工作关系着手，实行条线工作以兼职为主的方式，不搞上下对口，根据工作量大小、难易程度，统筹安排力量，少配专职人员。目前，镇机关只设党委办、人武部、村镇办、财政所四个职能机构。党委办公室主任兼任秘书。党委的组织、纪检、宣传只设委员，不配干事。平时各司其职，如有考察干部、查处案件等较重大的任务，则有分有合统一调度。
    ——以岗配人、人事相宜。几年来，镇机关内不管是国家干部，还是聘用干部，谁有本事就用谁，不称职的则就地解聘辞退。
    ——职权到位、目标管理。在定岗定人的基础上，镇党委８名委员、２名副镇长各人分管一条线，负责一个片，其他人员一级对一级负责，在本职范围内独立工作，独立处理问题，享有充分的自主权。同时，镇机关全面实施了岗位目标管理，制定了定期总结、百分考核制等配套措施，把个人利益与工作实绩直接挂钩，强化了激励机制，调动了机关工作人员的积极性。前洲镇的这些创新，江苏省委办公厅向全省作了通报。
    　　　　（二）
    前洲镇乡镇企业的发达是闻名全国的，但它的教育事业状况如何，中小学学生入学率、巩固率如何呢？这是我们的采访重点。
    在前洲镇的几天里，我们曾两次到镇中心幼儿园参观，这幢两层楼的建筑，比起一些城市漂亮的少年宫并不逊色。难怪省妇联的负责同志来参观后说，前洲镇中心幼儿园在江苏全省是数得着的一个。镇上为建这座２０００多平方米的中心幼儿园，投资近一百万元。幼儿园于１９８７年建成使用，可收托８个班４００个幼儿。幼儿教师中有３个是幼师毕业分配来的。
    我们还参观了前洲中学。副校长朱本渡不无自豪地说，前洲中学已有５０年的历史，过去一直是普通平房，现在的前洲中学有两座教学楼、一座实验楼，是近几年镇上易地投资新建的，教学楼前还有宽广的足球运动场和观众台，条件之好已是今非昔比。前洲中学是一所完中，全镇还有３所初级中学；还有一所中心小学和１６所村小。所有校舍全部翻建一新。全镇已提前实现９年义务制教育。小学学生入学率和毕业率均为１００％；初中学生入学率为９８．６％，毕业率为９７％，均居全省前列。此外，镇上还有一所干部管理学校（培训企业领导）、一所职工技术学校（培训在职职工），形成了从幼教和中小学到成人教育和职业教育的教育网络，为乡镇企业输送了和培养着大量人才。
    前洲镇的教育事业所以同乡镇企业一样兴旺发达，是因为镇党委和镇政府清醒地认识到，教育是当地经济和乡镇企业继续发展、提高的基础和希望。所以这几年的镇财政，每年约有１／３用于教育事业。以去年为例，镇财政收入３００万元，就有１００万元用来改善办学条件和教师的生活待遇。其中还不包括各村和各企业对教育的投入。教育受重视，教师受尊敬，在前洲镇已成为良好社会风气。我们为前洲人的高瞻远瞩高兴。
    　　　　（三）
    前洲镇的工业产值，去年已达６５９２６万元，占工农业的总产值的９７．７％，农业产值所占份额已经微不足道。难能可贵的是，这个人均只有七分地的前洲镇，改变了吃返销粮的历史，从１９８５年开始，每年向国家上交粮食４３０万公斤。在这里，乡镇企业越发展，农副业越受重视，村镇两级补农资金越多，粮食亩产水平越来越高。
    地处无锡市西北部的前洲镇，地势低洼易涝，１９７０年时是无锡县的３６个乡镇中最穷的一个镇。经过十多年的奋斗，这个镇在农田水利建设上取得了很大成绩。镇党委书记于顺源明确地说：“水利建设是前洲镇企业的母体。”为了改变前洲的落后面貌，必须改造低洼田，改造低洼田，就要大兴水利工程：总共新开了９０条河，新建了２２０多座桥，结果大大带动了乡镇村工业的兴起和发展。如今前洲镇工业总公司下属工厂有２００多家，有机械、纺织、轻工、冶金、化工等５００多种产品，行销国内２９个省、市、自治区，在国内享有一定声誉。还有一批外贸产品销往２０多个国家和地区，在国际市场上有较强的竞争能力。
    前洲镇镇村企业发展快的秘诀在于，他们不搞高分配高消费，重视积累投入再生产。前洲的工农业总产值在全县名列第一，消费分配水平却名列全县第五，人均存款达到１０００元，总计存款３７００万元。到去年年底，镇村两级集体固定资产多达１．５亿元，自有流动资金多达８５００万元。在当前的治理整顿中，前洲镇的企业自我调控能力明显强于别的地区。这不能不说是前洲人的高明之处。
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    前洲镇坚持以集体经济为主、乡镇工业为主、商品生产为主，走共同致富的道路，不仅每年向国家上交粮食，还上交大量税收，仅去年一年就达２３４６万元。经济繁荣，贡献突出，风尚也好。前洲镇党委的要求是：“干部带领群众致富，干部富在其中。”干部们也正是这样做的，因而得到了群众的拥护。党员的先锋模范作用在这儿越益明显，要求入党的人不断增多，党和社会主义在这儿有了号召力、吸引力和凝聚力。
