After the New Year, women's volleyball teams from Beijing, Fujian, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hebei, Henan, Sichuan, Yunnan, and Tianjin, totaling nine first-level teams, headed to Zhangzhou, Fujian, for a 70-day intensive winter training camp. Each team aims to quickly contribute talent to the national women's volleyball team, making this winter training session feel fresh and innovative.

Former national player Zhou Xiaolan, now deputy director of the State Sports General Administration's Volleyball Department, is leading the training for the first time. Upon arriving in Zhangzhou, she immediately focused on training reforms and oversaw the creation of a winter training plan guided by the principles of "emphasizing the cultivation of spirit, strengthening systematic training, carrying forward excellent traditions, and revitalizing volleyball." She personally supervises and directs the training on the field every day. She told the reporter that now her family is split into three places: her husband, Hou Xiaofei, is in Iceland as a volleyball expert, and her six-month-old daughter is with her mother in Shanxi. Both husband and wife are busy with volleyball, barely having time to write letters.

The Liaoning team, which has had good results in recent years, was disqualified from this winter training for not reporting on time. This incident caused a stir among the teams. "It's time to get serious," many coaches and players agreed. People were pleased to see that each team took this as a warning, training intensely. The sound of balls, shouts, and whistles filled the field, with everyone sweating profusely.

This year, with the implementation of new international competition rules, each team is focusing on training to find strategies and study tactics. Zhou Xiaolan explained that the first-level teams are an important source of talent for the national team. If the foundation is not solid, it will affect the upper levels. Therefore, focusing on training quality is crucial. Currently, each team is required to train for more than 40 hours per week without any reductions. Chen Zhonghe, who has been the assistant coach of the national women's volleyball team for many years and is now the coach of the Fujian women's volleyball team, finished a defensive training session and was so exhausted that he had to press his hand on his shoulder and groan in pain, showing the intensity of the training.

　　全国甲级女排漳州冬训见闻
    新年过后，北京、福建、江苏、浙江、河北、河南、四川、云南、天津等九支甲级女排劲旅开赴福建漳州，投入为期７０天的强化冬训。各队都想尽快给国家女排输送人才，此届冬训给人耳目一新之感。
    任国家体委排球处副处长的前国手周晓兰，第一次在此升旗挂帅抓“全盘”。她一到漳州便抓训练改革，主持制定了以“注重作风培养、加强系统训练、发扬优良传统、振兴排球运动”为指导思想的冬训计划，每天深入场地督阵指挥。她告诉笔者，如今她一家分三处，丈夫侯晓非远到冰岛国当排球专家，６个月的女儿放在山西娘家。夫妻俩忙于排球，几乎连写信的工夫都难挤出来。
    近年战绩颇佳的辽宁队，此次因未按时报到被取消冬训资格。这件事在各队中引起震动。“该动真格的了”，不少教练和队员们对此表示赞同。人们欣喜地看到，各队以此为戒，训练抓得很紧，场地上球声、呼声、哨声交织，人人练得大汗淋漓。
    今年，随着国际比赛实行新规则，各队抓紧在训练中摸索对策、研究打法。周晓兰介绍说，甲级队是国家队的重要兵源，基础不牢就会波及上层，因此抓训练质量最重要。现在各队训练时间要求每周４０小时以上，不能打折扣。曾多年担任国家女排陪打教练、现福建女排教练陈忠和一堂防守训练课下来，累得手按肩膀直叫疼，可见训练量之大。
