The All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese Economic Department, China Tongyuan Company, and the Chinese Enterprise Culture Research Institute have jointly established a multifunctional enterprise database for cooperation with Taiwan. This database stores detailed information about domestic enterprises seeking cooperation with Taiwan, making it convenient for Taiwanese businesses to invest in the mainland.

Currently, there are many projects from overseas and Taiwanese compatriots seeking to entrust the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese to find cooperation partners for processing trade. Domestic enterprises interested in these projects can send their information and requirements to Beijing, Box 1561. The Federation is willing to act as a bridge to facilitate such cooperation.
