Edition: 4

To commemorate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the nation and the 70th anniversary of the May Fourth Movement, our newspaper, in conjunction with the Communist Youth League Central Committee and the North China Pharmaceutical Factory, has decided to jointly organize the "Popular Topics Among Youth" essay contest with awards.

As the name suggests, the purpose of this essay contest is to focus on reflecting the various hot topics that contemporary youth discuss regarding reform. It aims to reflect the views and thoughts of the broad masses of youth on the achievements and changes of reform, the problems existing in reform, and the impact of reform on social life. What attitudes should be taken and what should be done? Through essays, we can exchange and discuss these issues, further unify the thoughts of young people, inspire the fighting spirit of young people, promote the positive spirit of young people, and encourage contemporary youth to actively participate in the reform tide, promoting the further development of the reform cause. This essay contest is for young people. Young people can write about their personal experiences or the experiences of their peers. They can express their opinions, using fictional elements to convey reality, or they can narrate facts, using real events to convey ideas. In short, as long as there is thought, content, and literary merit, regardless of the style used, we welcome it. Each essay should not exceed 1,500 words, and the author is responsible for the content. The facts must be accurate and error-free.

The essay submission period begins on February 24 and ends on June 10. The evaluation of outstanding works and the awarding of prizes will take place on July 1.

Once an essay is selected for publication, a manuscript fee will be paid, and finally, first, second, and third prizes will be awarded.

Please send the submitted essays to the Political and Legal Department of the People's Daily. On the envelope, please write "Popular Topics Among Youth" and attach sufficient postage.

　　《青年热门话题》征文启事
    为了纪念建国四十周年和“五四”运动七十周年，本报与共青团中央、华北制药厂决定联合举办《青年热门话题》有奖征文活动。
    顾名思义，这次征文的宗旨就是要比较集中地反映当代青年对改革的各种议论热点。反映广大青年对改革的成就和变化、对改革中存在的问题、对改革给社会生活带来的影响有什么看法和想法？抱什么态度和应该做些什么？通过征文进行交流和讨论，从而进一步统一青年人的思想，激励青年人的斗志，弘扬青年人的正气，促使当代青年积极投入改革的洪流，推动改革事业的进一步发展。此次征文是对青年人的征文，青年人可以写自己亲身经历的事，也可以写周围青年的事，可以发表议论，以虚带实，也可以通过叙述事实，以实带虚。总之，只要有思想，有内容，有文采，不管采用什么体裁，都为我们所欢迎。征文每篇不超过１５００字，文责自负，事实要求准确无误。
    征文从２月２４日开始，６月１０日截稿，７月１日评出优秀作品并进行奖励。
    征文一经选用，即付稿酬，最后评出一、二、三等奖若干名。
