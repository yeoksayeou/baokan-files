The livestock industry production-supply-sales cooperative in Tengzhou, established in 1981, is an intermediary service organization between the state and farmers. It encompasses 849 livestock enterprises and institutions of various ownership forms and functions, connecting with 5 livestock and poultry breeding bases, 550 specialized villages, and 3,700 specialized households across the entire city, with approximately 100,000 people engaged in the industry. It replaced the old system of administrative hierarchy and departmental division in managing livestock production, participating in and guiding production at various stages through services, achieving the following four effects.

It has promoted the rapid development of livestock commodity production. Under the old system, the livestock department managed production, the commercial and supply departments handled procurement, and the foreign trade department handled exports. Each department operated independently, and administrative commands were used to guide production. However, farmers faced practical issues such as breed selection, feed, market, and prices, which they were unable to solve. As a result, the development of livestock production was very slow.

After the initial establishment of the livestock production-supply-sales cooperative system in 1984, the situation changed significantly. The Tengzhou Livestock Bureau was transformed into the Lusnan Livestock Industry and Commerce Co., Ltd. The company has both administrative management and production operation functions. It successively established pig, sheep, chicken, and rabbit breeding farms, meat processing plants, cold storage plants, dairy product processing plants, and fur processing plants. The grain bureau leveraged its strengths to establish feed processing plants, while the commercial bureau, foreign trade bureau, and supply and marketing cooperatives utilized their production sites and equipment to expand procurement and organize circulation. The cooperative's enterprises and institutions at various levels organized production based on market demand, using their economic and technological strengths to promote the development of the livestock industry from all aspects. From 1985 to 1988, 200 million yuan was invested in livestock production, along with a large number of high-quality breeds. By the end of 1988, the number of sheep had increased to 420,000, poultry to 4 million, and rabbits to 780,000. In 1988, the output value of the livestock industry accounted for 28.4% of the total agricultural output value, ranking first among all districts and counties in the province.

It is beneficial to guide production according to the law of value. The old system of administrative hierarchy and departmental division in managing livestock production is a product of the planned economy, which does not consider the commodity rate, supply and demand relationship, and is not linked to market prices. Farmers "raise chickens to buy salt and pigs for the New Year," selling surplus livestock products to exchange for necessary items for production and living. After the initial establishment of the livestock production-supply-sales cooperative, the cooperative paid attention to guiding livestock production according to the law of value. First, it adjusted the allocation of total labor in the livestock industry among various departments. For example, the slaughtering capacity for chickens, ducks, and rabbits is matched with the fur and down processing capacity, and the fur and down processing is matched with the fur coat and down jacket processing capacity, etc. Prices are an important means for them to adjust the industrial structure, product structure, and interest relationships among production departments. For example, if farmers with roughly the same level of technical proficiency earn more from raising chickens than from raising rabbits, they will invest their labor and production materials into raising chickens; similarly, if raising sheep earns more than raising chickens, they will invest their labor and production materials into raising sheep. If such a situation occurs, it will cause one processing department to be unable to meet demand while another is overloaded, thereby affecting production development. To avoid this situation, they fully utilize the price lever to adjust farmers' income, making the input-output ratio of farmers engaged in various breeding industries roughly the same.

It is beneficial to share risks with farmers. As specialized breeding households, farmers are independent commodity producers and operators, as well as bearers of the entire cost of livestock production. To stand firm in the rapidly changing market, this is a great challenge for farmers who have not yet fully mastered commodity production, summarized as three major risks: epidemics, market, and prices. The livestock production-supply-sales cooperative regards farmers' production as the foundation for its own development, forming an equal, mutually beneficial, interdependent, and risk-sharing trading partnership with farmers. For this purpose, the city has gradually established and improved three guarantee systems.

Epidemic prevention guarantee system. This system is responsible for the technical training of livestock and poultry breeding and epidemic prevention, significantly improving the level of epidemic prevention technology. It has trained 5,500 people in batches for the staff of grassroots animal husbandry stations and "two households." The improvement in breeding level and epidemic prevention capabilities has reduced the average breeding period for broilers in the city to 67 days, a reduction of about 20 days compared to 1981, and the out-of-cage rate for meat rabbits has increased by 32%. The out-of-cage rate for pigs has also significantly improved.

Market guarantee system. The role of the market guarantee system is to facilitate circulation, ensuring that farmers' livestock products enter the market in a timely manner. The livestock industry and commerce company has transformed township livestock and veterinary stations into comprehensive service institutions, responsible for both livestock and poultry disease prevention and treatment and feed supply and livestock product procurement. They collect scattered chickens and rabbits from various places and send them to slaughterhouses in a timely manner. During procurement, only a small amount of service fee is collected. Farmers not only reduce losses during transportation but also save transportation costs.

Price protection system. In recent years, the domestic market has experienced tight supply and demand for meat, eggs, and milk, with prices rising. However, the prices of grain, fish meal, bone meal, and other feed additives have also increased, raising breeding costs. The price risk of livestock products is difficult for individual farmers to control. The export of livestock products is also constrained by the international market, with even greater price risks. The role of the price protection system is to protect the stable income of poultry and livestock breeders. Slaughterhouses, dairy product factories, etc., all implement factory-farmer linkage. The linkage contract stipulates: the factory, during the market peak for livestock products, purchases at market prices; during market stagnation, purchases at protection prices. Farmers, during the market peak for livestock products, guarantee to sell their products to the linked factory. Although the livestock product market has fluctuated several times in recent years, it has had little impact on production.

It is beneficial for the intermediary service organization to develop and strengthen itself. Practice has shown that intermediary organizations effectively serve the development of livestock production, which also promotes their own development. Since 1985, Tengzhou's livestock production has developed rapidly, and the cooperative has also grown stronger through its services. The livestock industry and commerce company, established in 1981 with only 92 million yuan in capital, has now become a series of production enterprises with considerable strength.

　　产供销一体化的有益尝试
　　——山东省滕州市畜牧业联合体的调查
    １９８１年开始组建的滕州市畜牧业产供销联合体，是在国家与农民之间的一种中间性服务组织。它囊括了不同所有制形式，不同功能的８４９家畜牧企事业单位，下连全市５个畜禽饲养基地，５５０个专业村，３７００个专业户，从业人员约１０万人。它代替了过去按行政层次、部门分工领导畜牧业生产的旧体制，通过服务，在各个环节上参与生产，指导生产，获得了以下四点效果。
    推动了畜牧业商品生产迅速发展。在旧体制下，畜牧部门管生产，商业、供销部门管收购，外贸部门管出口。敲锣卖糖，各管一行。再者，这些部门都靠行政命令指导生产，而农民在生产中所遇到的良种、饲料、市场、价格等实际问题又都无力解决。结果，畜牧业生产发展十分缓慢。
    １９８４年畜牧业产供销联合体制初步建成以后，情况就大不相同了。市畜牧局改为鲁南牧工商联合公司。公司具有行政管理和生产经营两种职能。它相继创办了猪、羊、鸡、兔良种培育场、肉食加工厂、冷藏厂、奶制品加工厂、皮毛加工厂。市粮食局发挥自己的优势，建立了饲料加工厂，市商业局、外贸局、供销社利用自己的生产场地和设备，扩大收购，组织流通。联合体各层次企事业单位根据市场需要组织生产，运用自己的经济技术实力，从各方面促进畜牧业发展。１９８５年以来，４年间向畜牧业生产投放资金２亿元，投放大批良种，到１９８８年底，羊发展到４２万只，禽４００万只，兔７８万只，１９８８年畜牧业产值占农业总产值达到２８．４％，在全省各区县中名列榜首。
    有利于按价值规律指导生产。按照行政层次和部门分工领导畜牧业生产的旧体制，是产品经济的产物，不考虑商品率、供求关系，更不与市场价格挂钩。农民“养鸡为买盐、养猪为过年”，卖出剩余畜产品是为了换回自己生产、生活的必需品。畜牧业产供销联合体初步建成以后，联合体注意按价值规律指导畜牧业生产。首先是调节畜牧生产总劳动在各部门之间的分配。如鸡、鸭、兔宰杀能力与皮毛绒加工能力相配套，皮毛绒加工与裘皮、羽绒服的加工能力相配套等。价格是他们用以调整产业结构、产品结构和生产部门之间利益关系的重要手段。例如，技术熟练程度大体相同的农民，如果养鸡比养兔收入高，那他就会把劳力和生产资料投向养鸡；同样，如果养羊比养鸡收入还高，那他就要把劳力和生产资料投向养羊。如果这种局面出现，那就会造成一种加工部门吃不饱，另一种加工部门吃不了，从而影响生产发展。为了避免这种情况的出现，他们充分运用价格杠杆。调节农民的收入，使从事各种饲养业的农民投入与收入的比例大体相同。
    有利于为农民分担风险。作为饲养专业户的农民，既是独立的商品生产者和经营者，也是畜牧业生产成本的全部承担者。要在瞬息万变的市场上立稳脚跟，这对于还没有完全学会商品生产的农民来说，是一个很大的困难，概括起来就是疫情、市场、价格三大风险。畜牧业产供销联合体把农民的生产作为自我发展的基础，与农民结成了平等互利、互为依托、利益均沾、风险共担的贸易伙伴，为此，全市逐步建立和完善了三大保证体系。
    防疫保证体系。这个体系负责畜禽饲养防疫技术培训工作，大面积提高防疫技术水平。对基层兽医站人员及“两户”分期分批进行培训，已先后培训５５００人次；饲养水平、防疫能力的提高，使全市肉鸡饲养期平均为６７天，比１９８１年缩短了２０天左右，肉兔出栏率提高了３２％。猪的出栏率也显著提高。
    市场保证体系。市场保证体系的作用在于疏理流通，使农民的畜产品及时进入市场。牧工商公司把乡镇畜牧兽医站建成综合性服务机构，既负责畜禽防病治病，又承担饲料供应和畜产品收购。他们把分散在各地的成鸡、兔及时收购起来集中送到宰杀厂。收购时只收少量的劳务费。农民既减少了运送途中的损失，又少支出运送费用。
    价格保护体系。近几年国内市场肉蛋奶供求关系紧张，价格上涨，但粮食、鱼粉、骨粉及其它各种饲料添加剂也涨价，饲养成本提高。畜产品的价格风险是个体农民难以驾驭的。出口畜产品又受到国际市场制约，价格风险更大。价格保护体系的作用是保护禽畜饲养者的稳定收入。宰杀厂、乳制品厂等都实行厂农挂钩。挂钩合同规定：厂方，在畜产品市场看俏时，收购价格随行就市；在市场滞销时，按保护价格收购。农民方面，在畜产品市场紧俏时，保证把产品卖给挂钩厂。这几年畜产品市场虽然几度波动，但对生产基本上没有大的影响。
    有利于中间服务组织自身的发展壮大。实践表明，中间组织有效地为畜牧业生产发展服务，就能使自身也得到发展。１９８５年以来，滕州市畜牧业生产大发展，联合体在服务中也发展壮大了。牧工商公司１９８１年建立之初只有资金９２０万元，现在已成为一个颇有实力的系列化生产企业。
