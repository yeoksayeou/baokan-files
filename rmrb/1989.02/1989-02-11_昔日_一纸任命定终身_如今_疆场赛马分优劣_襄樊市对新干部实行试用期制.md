	"Competition on the Field to Determine Merit." The city of Xiangfan in Hubei Province has broken away from the traditional method of promoting officials by implementing a probationary period system for newly promoted officials. By January of this year, the entire city has already implemented this probationary system for over 280 newly promoted leading officials.

	In the past, Xiangfan City promoted officials through a "one paper appointment for life" system. This method of promotion only provided a clear understanding of the officials' abilities and achievements in their original positions, while their potential abilities, especially their competence and capabilities in the intended leadership positions, could only be predicted. To reform this flaw in the promotion of officials, in April of last year, the Xiangfan Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government decided to implement a probationary period system for promoted officials, with a probationary period of one year. After the probationary period, the probationary officials will give a job performance report in their respective units, followed by a democratic evaluation by the masses. Based on this, a public opinion poll will be conducted, and finally, the organizational department will conduct an assessment and review. Those who pass the review will receive a formal appointment notice; those who do not pass will immediately have their probationary positions canceled and will return to their original positions or be reassigned to other work.

	After Xiangfan City implemented the probationary period system for newly promoted officials, it reduced the mistakes in promoting officials and also made the newly promoted officials have a strong sense of crisis and pressure, working even harder.

　　昔日“一纸任命定终身”    
    如今“疆场赛马分优劣”     
    襄樊市对新干部实行试用期制
    新华社武汉２月１０日电（记者施勇峰、通讯员陈惠明）“疆场赛马分优劣”。湖北省襄樊市打破传统的干部提拔方法，对新提拔的干部实行试用期制度。到今年１月，全市已对２８０多名新提拔的领导干部实行了试用制。
    过去，襄樊市提拔干部都是“一纸任命定终身”。这种提拔干部的方式仅仅是对干部在原岗位上表现出的能力和取得的实绩比较清楚，而对干部的潜在能力，特别是对在拟任实际领导岗位上的胜任程度和能力只能做出预测。为改革干部任用上的这一弊端，去年４月襄樊市委、市政府决定，实行提拔干部试用期制度，试用期为１年。试用期满后，由试用干部在本单位作述职报告，然后由群众民主评议，在此基础上进行民意测验投票，最后由组织部门考核评审。评审合格者，下发正式任职通知；不合格者，立即取消试用职务，回原岗位或另行分配工作。
    襄樊市对新提拔干部实行试用期制度后，减少了提拔干部中的失误，同时也使新提拔的干部有强烈的危机意识和压力，更加努力地工作。
