	Leading the Way
	—A Record of Changping County's Three Consecutive Victories in the "100% Competition"

	Reporters: Wu Hao and Zhao Xinglin

	In recent years, Beijing Municipality has held a "100% Competition" in the suburbs and counties to promote material and spiritual civilization. By 1988, Changping County had won the championship for the third time. The people of Changping said they had achieved a "three-peat," which caused quite a stir among the officials of the districts and counties in Beijing and in the hearts of the people of Changping.

	The changes in Changping are most evident to the people of Changping. The older generation will inevitably compare today's brand-new streets, towering buildings, and garden-like layouts with the dilapidated alleys of the past; the younger generation will inevitably compare it with the cities they have traveled to, and after comparing, the people of Changping genuinely feel a sense of pride.

	The speed of Changping's development is quite astonishing. They achieved a doubling of their total industrial and agricultural output in just 8 years, two years ahead of schedule for the "Seventh Five-Year Plan." Last year, the county's total industrial and agricultural output reached 2.04 billion yuan, an increase of 61.9% over the previous year. Rural economic income reached 2.28 billion yuan, an increase of 78.5% over the previous year. Hearing these two figures, the reporter jokingly asked County Magistrate Zhang Geng: "Are you guys doing another 'Great Leap Forward'?" Zhang Geng smiled deeply and said, "No, Changping's speed is steady, solid, and reasonable. One piece of evidence is that Changping's speed and efficiency are basically in sync. Take the countryside as an example: last year, the county's rural pure income was 680 million yuan, an increase of 48% over the previous year; rural tax revenue was 83.74 million yuan, an increase of 67% over the previous year; rural accumulation reached 240 million yuan, an increase of 111% over the previous year; and in the face of reduced arable land, grain production increased by 100 million kilograms. The county's fiscal revenue last year reached 104 million yuan, an increase of 33.8% over the previous year. Another piece of evidence is that Changping still has momentum. We are not fighting a war of attrition, but a war of accumulation. We expect that in 1989, Changping's development will 'reach new heights.'"

	What is the driving force behind Changping's development?

	Changping's development relies on favorable timing, geographical advantages, and harmonious relationships. Favorable timing refers to the fact that in recent years, there has been a reform momentum and atmosphere, with correct leadership from the central government and the municipality; geographical advantages refer to the fact that Changping is indeed a good place, with mountains and rivers, abundant resources, and especially the 13 tombs left by the Ming Emperor Zhu Di and his descendants on Tianzhu Mountain. This place, at the foot of the Great Wall, is majestic and charming in all four seasons. It is only 30 kilometers away from Deshengmen, with the Jingzhang Highway and Jingbao Railway running north and south, and the Daqin Railway and Jingtong Railway running east and west. In times of war, it guarded the northern gate of the capital, and in times of commercial development, it serves as a gateway for various goods to enter and exit the capital. Harmonious relationships refer mainly to the fact that since the reform and opening up, the people of Changping have gradually formed a "Changping Spirit" with distinctive characteristics of the times. In summary, it is "high standards, strict requirements, striving for the forefront, and creating the best." In the past, Changping was long in a state of closure and conservatism, and people were satisfied as long as they had enough to eat. It was the tide of reform and opening up that made the people of Changping regain their spirit of progress.

	Why did people's value standards change as soon as they experienced reform and opening up? County Party Secretary Yang Zhaoshi and County Magistrate Zhang Geng gave the following explanation:

	Firstly, Changping's "attractiveness" was brought into play. Changping is a satellite city and a famous tourist and scenic area. In the past, these advantages were not linked to the development of Changping's economy. For the caravans heading to the Thirteen Tombs and the astonished foreigners, the people of Changping showed indifference, only feeling strange: how could those foreign girls in high heels climb the steps of the Hall of the Great Hall of the Tomb of Chang? No one ever thought of making money while providing them with something. In recent years, the people of Changping have suddenly become smarter, having their own "attractiveness," attracting financial, material, and human resources from all directions to develop and strengthen themselves. Changping built so many tall buildings; do you think they all came from their own pockets? No, most of them were built with other people's money. In the words of the people of Changping, this is called "borrowing other people's money to do one's own business; borrowing other people's brains (wisdom) to build Changping." Now, various types of joint ventures have reached more than 600 in Changping, attracting 80 million yuan in funds; famous stores in the city, such as Quanjude Roast Duck, Donglaishun Hotpot, Fengzhe Garden, Hongbinlou, Pranda Laundry, Siliang Hairdressing Salon, Dabei Photography Studio, Tianqiao Department Store, Friendship Store, and Dong'an Market, have all set up branches in Changping; 12 universities have either moved to Changping or set up branch schools, and more than 3,000 professionals or skilled workers have come to work in Changping. Changping's registered population is 390,000, but the actual number of people living in Changping is 560,000. People say, "It's better to have a bed in the city than three rooms in the suburbs." The "attractiveness" of Changping has changed some people's traditional concepts!

	Just last autumn, Changping held the Beijing Naadam Fair. Naadam is a Mongolian custom, and Changping "invited" it from the Xilingol Grassland, using culture and sports as a medium to develop Changping's economy. The participants from all directions only knew that wrestling was exciting and horse racing was lively, but they did not know that in these 10 days, Changping discussed more than 80 projects, introduced 30.82 million yuan in cooperative funds, introduced 12 technologies, exported 2 technologies, and the commodity transaction amount reached more than 40 million yuan. The Naadam Fair made Changping's "attractiveness" even greater.

	Secondly, the spirit of pragmatism was advocated, and one-size-fits-all approaches were not adopted. Two-thirds of Changping is mountainous or semi-mountainous, and one-third is flatland. The natural, social, and technological conditions are quite different. In the past, it seemed that everything had to be one-size-fits-all. A municipal leader once said, "In the past, poverty was caused by this one-size-fits-all approach." This leader, when he was the county party secretary of Changping, said: "Even if it's individual farming in the mountain valleys, as long as productivity develops, it is in line with Marxism." The leaders of Changping County advocated pragmatism and proposed different strategies for different situations. They delegated power to townships, villages, and households, allowing them to develop themselves as long as they did not violate policies. Any method could be used.

	Take the promotion of moderately scaled operations in rural areas as an example. They set two principles: first, the plain areas should act according to their capabilities and adopt multiple forms; second, the mountainous areas should not engage in farming, and should develop forestry and fruit cultivation according to local conditions. In the plain areas, many townships and villages have already shifted to industry as the main focus, with 80-90% of the labor force transferring to industry. In this situation, implementing scaled operations is feasible. However, the implementation of scaled operations should not be separated from people's thoughts and actual conditions, nor from objective conditions such as water conservancy, agricultural machinery, and technology. It must be based on the principle of "moderation," and bigger is not always better. In the 200-plus villages implementing scaled operations across the county, the average number of acres cultivated by each person engaged in agriculture is 13. The reporter visited some local farmers, and they believed that this level was reasonable and feasible. In organizing production in mountainous areas, Changping County changed its past practices and proposed that family economy should be the main focus, "planting trees where suitable, grazing where suitable," "focusing on forestry and fruit in the distance, livestock in the near, and developing secondary industries around resources." By last year, there were already 1,035 specialized households in the mountainous areas, accounting for 56% of the total households in the mountainous areas. The per capita income in the mountainous areas reached 848.6 yuan, an increase of 31.6% over the previous year. The mountainous areas have shaken off poverty.

	Thirdly, leadership art was improved, and work methods were reformed. The officials and masses of Changping, from top to bottom, all have a vigorous spirit. Where does this spirit come from? The county committee leadership introduced the situation of strengthening the party's grassroots construction during the reform and opening up. This experience was introduced at the national conference of county party secretaries held by the Organization Department in Changping last year and was highly praised by the participants. Yang Zhaoshi said: The main responsibility of the county committee leadership is political leadership and macro decision-making. Important issues are discussed by the county committee, and once decided, they are executed separately. Yang Zhaoshi and other county committee leaders often give situation reports to all county officials, believing that this is a good tradition of the party's ideological and political work. Situation education is not about lecturing on many big principles, but about unifying understanding, boosting morale, and enhancing cohesion. The county committee organizes a one-week training session every year for 1,200 grassroots branch secretaries to improve the quality of grassroots cadres. At the beginning of the year, from the county to the townships and villages, contracts are signed layer by layer, with responsibilities, rights, and interests all written down. Everyone feels the pressure on their shoulders and the goal in front of them. They use the method of linking rings and holding on tightly.

	In 1988, Changping County created the leadership method of "focusing on large villages." The county directly led 50 economically strong villages with an annual income of more than 50 million yuan. Large villages directly signed contracts with the county magistrate. As a result, 10 townships and villages in the county had an income of more than 100 million yuan, not only did the large villages develop first, but also one large village brought along a group of small villages, and the large villages became rich, followed by the small villages. Changping County's focus on large villages is based on the idea of concentrating leadership efforts on supporting and organizing advanced points. In the past, the saying "grab both ends and bring the middle" actually meant grabbing one end, the backward end; as communists, our hearts are always with the poor, fearing that the poor will go hungry, resulting in the more we grab, the poorer we become. Changping's focus on large villages is actually focusing on the advanced and the rich, resulting in not only not delaying the development of backward and poor areas, but also bringing them up. Changping County Committee believes that the method of focusing on large villages has a fundamental nature. Poor areas are primarily outdated in their concepts, and focusing on the advanced can promote the transformation of concepts in poor areas. If we always focus on poverty alleviation (of course, we cannot relax our work in poor areas), then we will never become rich.

	The organizational structure of Changping County is also very distinctive. They have long implemented the separation of party and government, with the county committee and government not setting overlapping organizations. The five major systems of the Economic Commission, Financial Commission, Township and Village Enterprise Commission, Agricultural Commission, and Foreign Economic Commission are all under the government series. In other places, the county Economic Commission is responsible for all county industrial enterprises, but Changping's county Economic Commission only manages county-owned enterprises, and township and village enterprises are managed by the township and village Economic Commission. Comprehensive balancing is directly managed by the county magistrate. They summarize the county's economic pattern with two sentences: "The whole county plays one game of chess, and everyone works together to develop the economy."

	The people of Changping took another big step forward in the Year of the Dragon, and the facts once again proved how correct the saying "everything depends on people" is!

　　站在排头
    ——北京市昌平县夺取百分赛“三连冠”纪实
    本报记者  吴昊  赵兴林
    这几年，北京市在郊区县的物质文明和精神文明建设中，每年都要开展百分赛，到了１９８８年，昌平县已经是第三次夺魁了。昌平人说是夺得了“三连冠”，这在北京市的区、县干部中，在昌平人的心底，都是不小的震动。
    昌平的变化，昌平人最清楚。年老一点的，无疑要拿今天这崭新的街道、林立的楼房、花园一样的布局和过去的破街烂巷比；年轻人，无疑要和他们走过的城市比，比来比去，昌平人由衷地产生了一种自豪感。
    昌平速度，说起来蛮惊人的，他们仅用了８年就实现了工农业总产值翻两番，提前两年实现了“七五”计划。去年全县的工农业总产值达到２０．４亿元，比上一年增加了６１．９％。农村经济收入达到２２．８亿元，比上一年增加７８．５％。听到了这两个数字，记者打趣地问张耕县长：“你们是不是又在搞‘大跃进’？”张县长深情地一笑说：“不是，昌平的速度是稳妥的、实在的、合理的。证据之一，是昌平的速度与效益基本同步，就以农村来说，去年全县的农村纯收入是６．８亿元，比上年增长４８％；农村上缴税金为８３７４万元，比上年增加６７％；农村积累达到２．４亿元，比上一年增长１１１％；农村在耕地减少的情况下，粮食增产１０００万公斤。全县去年的财政收入达到一亿零四百余万元，比上一年增长３３．８％。证据之二，是昌平还有后劲，我们打的不是消耗仗，而是积累仗，预计１９８９年，昌平的发展会‘更上一层楼’的。”
    昌平的发展靠什么呢？
    昌平的发展靠的是天时、地利、人和。天时者，是说这几年有改革的大形势、大气候，有中央和市的正确领导；地利者，昌平确实是个好地方，有山有水，物产丰富，特别是明成祖朱棣以及他的后代在天寿山留下了１３座陵墓，这长城脚下，巍巍壮观，四时迷人，这里离德胜门只有３０公里，京张公路、京包铁路纵穿南北，大秦铁路、京通铁路横贯东西。在打仗的年代，守护着京城的北大门，在商品经济大发展的年代，则为京城吞进吐出各种商品，为首都服务；人和者，主要是改革开放以来，昌平人逐步形成了具有时代特色的“昌平精神”。概括起来即是“高标准，严要求，争上游，创一流”。在过去的年代，昌平长期处于封闭、保守的境界，人只要吃饱肚子，就心满意足了，是改革、开放的大潮，使昌平人焕发了向上进取的精神。
    为什么一经改革、开放，人的价值尺度就变了呢？对此，县委书记杨朝仕和县长张耕作了如下的概述：
    首先是发挥了昌平的“吸”劲。昌平是卫星城，又是著名的旅游区、风景区，过去并没有把这些优势和发展昌平的经济联系起来，对于驶向十三陵的汽车队，对于惊叹不止的洋人，昌平人表现得十分冷漠，只是心里感到奇怪：洋妞们穿着那么高的高跟鞋，怎么上得了长陵大殿的台阶？从来没有人想到要在给他们点什么的同时发点财、捞点什么。这几年，昌平人一下子变聪明起来，有了自己的“吸”劲，吸收四方八面的财力、物力、人力，发展和壮大自己，昌平盖了那么多大楼，你以为都是掏自己的腰包吗？不是，大部分是用别人的钱盖的，用昌平人的话说，这叫借别人的钱办自己的事；借别人的脑袋（智慧）建设昌平。如今，各种各样的联合企业，在昌平已达６００余家，吸引资金８０００多万元，京城里的名店，全聚德烤鸭、东来顺涮羊肉、丰泽园、鸿宾楼，普兰德洗衣店、四联美发厅、大北照像馆、天桥商场、友谊商店、东安市场都在昌平设了分店；有１２所大学或迁到昌平，或在昌平设了分校，３０００多名有职称或有一技之长的知识分子来到昌平工作，昌平的本县人口是３９万，实际在昌平居住的是５６万，人们说“宁要城里一张床，不要郊区三间房”，昌平的“吸”劲，硬是把一些人的这个传统观念给改了！
    就在去年秋天，昌平举办了北京那达慕大会。那达慕是蒙古人的习俗，昌平把它从锡林郭勒草原“请”了来，利用文化、体育为媒，发展昌平经济，参加大会的四面八方的游人只知道摔跤好看，赛马热闹，却不知在这１０天里，昌平洽谈了８０多个项目，引进合作资金３０８２万元，引进技术１２项，输出技术两项，商品交易额达４００余万元。那达慕大会使昌平的“吸”劲更大了。
    其次，发扬求实精神，不搞一刀切。昌平２／３是山区半山区，１／３是平川，自然条件、社会条件、技术条件差异都很大，当县城的姑娘穿着时装模仿港味、追赶新潮的时候，山区老乡还戴着毡帽头，穿着大裆棉裤晒太阳，对于这样的差异，过去似乎总是不理解，什么事情都要一刀切，市里的一位领导说得好：“过去受穷，就吃亏在这一刀切上了。”这位领导同志在昌平当县委书记时就说过：山沟沟里哪怕是单干，只要生产力发展了，也是符合马克思主义的。昌平县的领导发扬求实精神，提出什么事情什么对策，他们给乡、村、户层层放权，只要能发展自己，不违反政策，什么招数都可以往出端。（⑴⑵）
    就拿农村推广适度规模经营来说，他们订了两条原则，一是平原区量力而行，多种形式；二是山区农田不搞、林果因地制宜。平原区不少乡、村已变得以工为主，百分之八、九十的劳力转到了工业上，在这种情况下，实行规模经营是可行的。但实行规模经营又不能脱离人们的思想实际，不能脱离水利、农机、技术等客观条件，一定要本着“适度”二字，不能越大越好。全县实行规模经营的２００多个村，平均从事农业的劳力每人耕田１３亩，记者访问了一些当地农民，他们认为这个水平是合理的、可行的。在组织山区生产上，昌平县一改过去的做法，提出以家庭经济为主，“宜林则林，宜牧则牧”、“远抓林果近靠畜牧，围绕资源抓工副”，到去年，全县山区已有饲养、林木等专业户１０３５户，占山区总户数的５６％，山区人均收入达到８４８．６元，比上一年增加了３１．６％。山区脱贫了。
    再次，提高领导艺术，改进工作方法。昌平的干部群众上上下下都有一股子热气腾腾的劲头。这股子劲头是怎么来的？县委领导介绍了在改革开放中如何加强党的基层建设的情况，他们的这一条经验曾在去年中组部在昌平召开的全国部分县委书记座谈会上作过介绍，受到了与会者的好评。杨朝仕说：县委领导主要是政治领导，宏观决策。重要问题县委讨论，一经决定，则分别执行。杨朝仕等县委领导干部经常为全县干部做形势报告，他们认为这是党的思想政治工作的优良传统，形势教育，不在于讲多少大道理，而在于统一认识、鼓舞士气，增强凝聚力。县委每年都要对１２００名基层支部书记进行为时一周的培训，提高基层干部的素质。年初的时候，从县到乡、村，层层签订合同，责、权、利都写在纸上，千斤担子众人挑，人人肩上有指标。以后每月检查，半年评比，人人都觉得肩头有压力，眼前有奔头。他们用的是环环扣紧、咬住不放的工作方法。
    在１９８８年，昌平县创造了“抓大村”的领导方法。县里对经济基础好、年收入５００万元以上的５０个经济大村实行直接领导，大村直接与县长订合同。结果全县有１０个村镇收入超亿元，不仅大村率先发展，而且一个大村带动一片小村，大村富小村跟着富。昌平县抓大村是基于这样一种思想：就是要把领导主要精力放到支持、组织先进点上。过去说的“抓两头，带中间”，实际上往往抓的是一头，即后进的一头，穷的一头；作为共产党人，心理总是偏向穷人，生怕穷人饿了肚子，结果是越抓越穷。昌平的抓大村，实际上是抓先进，抓富裕，结果不仅没有耽误后进、贫困地区的发展，反而把他们带起来了。昌平县委认为，抓大村的方法带有根本的性质，贫困地区首先是观念陈旧，抓先进可以促进贫困地区的观念转变。如果总是把精力放在脱贫上（当然对贫困地区的工作不能放松），那么我们就永远也富不起来。
    昌平县的机构设置也是很有特色的。他们早就实行了党政分开，县委与政府不设重叠机构，经委、财委、乡镇企业委、农委、外经委，五大系统，全部归入政府系列。在其他地方，县经委是管全县工业企业的，而昌平的县经委只管县办企业，乡镇企业由乡镇经委归口管理，综合平衡的事情由县长直接管。他们用这样两句话概括全县的经济格局：“全县共走一盘棋，齐心协力抓经济”。
    昌平人在龙年又向前跨进了一大步，事实又一次证明了“事在人为”这句话是多么的正确！
