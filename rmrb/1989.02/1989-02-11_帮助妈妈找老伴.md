In a new house in Shanshi Beili, Tangshan City, siblings Liang Yanyan and Liang Junying are happily enjoying the festive atmosphere of the New Year, savoring the sweetness of wedding candy: on the first day of the New Year, their 58-year-old mother, Cui Shuxin, remarried.

Cui Shuxin lost her husband in the 1976 Tangshan earthquake. Since then, she has endured her grief, working while taking care of her children's lives. Twelve years have passed, and her children have all found enviable careers and happy families.

Since retiring, Cui Shuxin has felt particularly lonely, often gazing at her late husband's portrait in a daze.

The married siblings tried every means to make their mother happy, but she remained melancholic. They discussed helping her find a new partner. Cui Shuxin, upon hearing this, said it would be disrespectful to her current children and her late husband, and that people would talk. The siblings repeatedly persuaded her, saying, "Even if you get married, you will still be our good mother. We will still be a family, just like before." Cui Shuxin nodded tearfully.

After some effort, they finally found an ideal husband for their mother.

The 68-year-old groom, Zhou Wenjing, is a member of the Hebei Provincial Political Consultative Conference and greatly admires Cui Shuxin. Cui Shuxin is also satisfied with Zhou Wenjing. Thus, a new family was formed.

Inside the new house, there is deep affection; outside, firecrackers are going off one after another. Amidst the firecrackers, they bid farewell to the past years and also to traditional, feudal moral concepts.

　　帮助妈妈找老伴
    新华社记者  郑战国  新华社通讯员  穆晓青
    在唐山市山西北里的一栋新房里，梁延年、梁俊英兄妹俩正伴着新春的鞭炮声，乐滋滋儿地吃着喜糖：大年初一，他们５８岁的妈妈崔淑琴第二次结婚了。
    崔淑琴是在１９７６年唐山大地震中失去丈夫的。在那以后，她忍着悲痛一边工作，一边照料儿女的生活。１２个春秋过去了，子女都有了令人羡慕的职业和甜蜜的小家庭。
    自打退休后，崔淑琴感到特别孤独，常常凝视着丈夫的遗像发呆。
    成家的兄妹俩想尽办法努力使母亲高兴，但母亲依然郁郁寡欢。他们商量帮她再找个老伴。崔淑琴知道后却说，这样做对不起眼前的儿女和死去的丈夫，是要让人非议的。兄妹俩反复劝道：“您结了婚，仍然是我们的好妈妈，咱们仍像从前一样，还是一家人。”崔淑琴含泪点头了。
    经过一番努力，他们终于帮妈妈找了一个理想的丈夫。
    ６８岁的新郎邹文靖是河北省政协委员，对崔淑琴非常敬佩。崔淑琴对邹文靖也表示满意。于是一个新的家庭组成了。
    新房内，充满了深情厚意；新房外，鞭炮声此起彼伏。鞭炮声中，他们送走了过去的岁月，也辞去了传统、封建的道德观念。
