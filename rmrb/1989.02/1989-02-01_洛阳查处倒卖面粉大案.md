Recently, the Economic Inspection Brigade of the Luoyang Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce, in cooperation with relevant departments, uncovered a case involving the collusion and resale of 58.5 tons of subsidized flour. They seized 62.5 tons of grain coupons, 12,500 yuan in cash, and 1 ton of flour.

On December 9 last year, the Economic Inspection Brigade of Luoyang City, based on clues provided by relevant departments, worked for three days and nights to investigate and uncover the illegal activities of five individuals, including Zhou Jianhua, a farmer from Guanlin Town in the suburbs, in reselling flour. The purpose was to maintain the normal supply order of grain.

From the investigation, it was found that this case involved many units and individuals, and the amount of flour resold was substantial. Since 1986, Zhou Jianhua has used various means to collude with individual clerks and drivers from the grain department to purchase a large number of grain coupons from the black market. He then obtained flour from grain stores to resell, thereby making huge profits.

The main reason Zhou Jianhua and others could engage in the illegal activities of purchasing and reselling flour for a long time is that some grain stores and relevant personnel provided them with convenient conditions. These grain stores, knowing that the actions were not in accordance with regulations, falsified documents and used internal transfer methods. They issued transfer orders in the name of supplying professional households and steamed bun households, selling large quantities of high-grade flour and standard flour to illegal resellers. They thus collected additional money outside the coupons.

More seriously, since last November, the Fujiatun Grain Store of the First Grain and Oil Supply Company in Jianxi District, Luoyang City, has issued transfer orders and sent 25,000 kilograms of high-grade flour to Zhou Jianhua without receiving payment. No one has taken any notice of this, and such "generosity" in selling large quantities of national flour on credit is truly infuriating!

### 洛阳查处倒卖面粉大案

　　洛阳查处倒卖面粉大案
    本报讯  最近，河南省洛阳市工商局经济检查大队在有关部门的配合下，查获了一起内外勾结倒卖平价面粉５８．５万公斤的案件，查扣粮票６．２５万公斤，现金１２５００元，面粉１０００公斤。
    去年１２月９日，洛阳市经检大队根据有关部门提供的线索，为维护粮食正常供应秩序，经过３个昼夜的内查外调，先后查出了郊区关林镇农民周建华等５人倒卖面粉违法活动。
    从查处的情况看，此案不但涉及单位和人员多，而且倒卖面粉数量大。１９８６年以来，周建华利用各种手段，与粮食部门个别营业员、司机相勾结，从黑市上套购大量粮票，然后从粮店调出面粉倒卖，从中牟取暴利。
    周建华等人能够长期从事套购倒卖面粉，主要原因是一些粮店及有关人员为他们提供方便条件。这些粮店明知不符合规定，却弄虚作假，采用内部调拨手法，以供应专业户、蒸馍户的名义，开出调拨单，将大批富强粉、标准粉售给倒卖面粉的违法分子，从而多收票外款。
    更为严重的是，洛阳市涧西第一粮油供销公司符家屯粮店从去年１１月份以来，已开出调拨单手续，送给周建华富强粉２．５万公斤，至今未收粮款，竟无人过问，如此“慷慨”地将国家大批面粉赊销在外，实在令人气愤！
