Ten Thousand People in Shiyan Come Together to Help
Girl Student Liu Yun Recovers and Leaves Hospital

According to Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, February 19th - (Correspondent Xiao Qingping) An unfortunate accident left 14-year-old Liu Yun bedridden for several months. This rural girl received treatment during which over ten thousand people in Shiyan donated money. Under the care of society, Liu Yun was discharged from the hospital on January 23rd.

On May 14th last year, Liu Yun, a daughter of a farmer from Xiaoheshi Township in Maojian District, Shiyan City, accidentally stepped on a syringe needle. The needle pierced from her heel to the bone. Soon, her left foot began to swell. On May 18th, Liu Yun's condition suddenly worsened, and she was taken to the hospital by her parents. Medical staff found that the virus had entered Liu Yun's blood and bone marrow, causing osteomyelitis and sepsis.

Due to the osteomyelitis destroying the bone tissue, Liu Yun had to stay in the hospital for an extended period, which required several thousand yuan. Liu Yun's family earned less than 1,000 yuan a year, and her parents borrowed money from all directions to gather 2,000 yuan. However, this was only enough for more than two months of treatment. The school's Youth League Committee learned of this situation and decided to write to the newspaper seeking help from society. On October 11th, a letter titled "Save the Child" was published in the "Shiyan Daily." That day, people started sending money and gifts to the school. A few days later, remittance slips and letters of condolence flooded in. Over three months, more than 150 people from the city visited the hospital to see and comfort Liu Yun. A total of 48 units and 13,000 people donated over 4,000 yuan.

　　十堰市万人解囊相助
    女学生刘云伤愈出院
    据新华社武汉２月１９日电  （通讯员肖清平）一次意外不幸，使１４岁的刘云卧床数月不起。这位农家少女在治疗期间，十堰市有一万多人为她捐款。在社会的关怀下，刘云已经在１月２３日伤愈出院。
    去年５月１４日，十堰市茅箭区小河乡农民女儿刘云不慎踩在一根注射针头上，针尖从脚后跟一直扎到骨里，不久左脚开始红肿。５月１８日，刘云病情突然加重，被父母送到铁道部十一工程局二处医院。医务人员检查发现，病毒已进入刘云的血液和骨髓，引起骨髓炎，并发败血症。
    由于骨髓炎破坏了骨质，刘云必须长期住院，这需要花几千元。刘云的家一年收入不到１千元，父母东筹西借才凑到２０００元。但这只够两个多月的治疗费。刘云所在学校团总支得知这一情况后，决定投书报社求助社会的帮助。１０月１１日，一封题为《救救孩子》的来信，在《十堰报》登出后，当天就有人给学校送来了钱和慰问品。几天后，汇款单和慰问信像雪片一样飞来。３个多月里，全市有１５０多人到医院探望、慰问刘云，有４８个单位、１３０００多人捐款４０００余元。
