Each Expresses Their Views and Discusses the Future: The Davos Economic Discussion Conference Closes

According to Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, February 1: (Reporter Xiang Kui Guan) The 19th World Economic Forum, organized by the "World Economic Forum," concluded today in Davos, Switzerland.

The conference lasted a week. Over a thousand senior officials and economic experts from 64 countries and regions discussed the prospects for world economic and trade development in the 1990s, the construction of the European internal market by 1992, and the debt of the Third World, among other issues, and engaged in heated debates.

Professor Herbert Giersch, Director of the Institute for World Economy and International Management at the University of Kiel in the Federal Republic of Germany, said that the world economy is entering a new period of growth, and economic recession can be avoided. However, he did not deny that the relatively stable period of the world economy is coming to an end.

Professor Lester Thurow of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Department of Economics expressed pessimism about the development of world trade in the 1990s. He said that international trade will not move towards liberalization in the next 10 years. He predicted that this year will be a year of sharp conflicts in world trade.

At this conference, many representatives from various countries spoke, calling for the formulation of new strategies to reduce the debt burden of the Third World.

　　达沃斯经济讨论会闭幕
    据新华社日内瓦２月１日电  （记者向奎观）由“世界经济论坛”主办的第１９届世界经济讨论会今天在瑞士达沃斯城闭幕。
    讨论会历时一周。来自６４个国家和地区的上千名高级官员和经济专家就９０年代世界经济、贸易发展前景、１９９２年欧洲内部统一市场建设、第三世界债务等问题各抒己见，展开了热烈辩论。
    联邦德国基尔大学世界经济发展研究所所长赫伯特·吉尔施教授说，世界经济正进入一个新的增长时期，经济衰退是可以避免的。但是，他也不否认世界经济相对稳定时期正在结束。
    美国马萨诸塞工业学院经济系教授莱斯特·瑟罗对９０年代的世界贸易发展表示悲观。他说，今后１０年国际贸易不可能向自由化发展。他预言今年是世界贸易冲突尖锐的一年。
    在本届讨论会上，许多国家代表发言，要求制定新的减轻第三世界债务负担的战略。
