The China Academy of Preventive Medicine has completed a five-year transformation of its functions, evolving from a purely research institution into a comprehensive national health management decision-making advisory body that conducts scientific research, provides guidance and training, monitors and supervises, develops standards, and exchanges information. Out of the approximately 310 projects they undertake each year, over 40% are national key or breakthrough projects, playing a significant role in the prevention and control of major and widespread diseases nationwide.

For cyclical epidemic diseases like meningitis, to prevent outbreaks in the 1980s, the Academy conducted research on monitoring, prediction, and control measures. This effort reduced the incidence rate from 11 per 100,000 in 1983 to 1.6 per 100,000 in 1988, the lowest rate in history.

Over the past five years, there have been 33 sudden outbreaks of epidemics nationwide. For diseases with unknown causes and severe consequences, such as Paper Mill Disease, spoiled sugarcane poisoning, wood ear mushroom poisoning, and adult diarrhea, the Academy conducted systematic investigations and proposed diagnostic methods and preventive strategies.

In the prevention of diseases, they not only provide simple, accurate, and easily applicable diagnostic methods and reagents but also developed a number of new drugs for the prevention and treatment of malaria, echinococcosis, hookworm disease, and antiviral and anti-tumor treatments. A three-year public nutrition field trial improved the growth and development of children in seven provinces, providing valuable experience for improving nutrition in rural areas. They also identified the primary cause of the high incidence of lung cancer in Yunnan's Xuanwei as indoor air pollution from coal burning, a finding that garnered international attention.

Due to the Academy's strengthened inspections and provision of standards, the qualification rate of imported grains, oils, sugars, and milk powder has increased from 69% in 1981 to 97%.

　　中国预防医科院转变职能    
    成为科学研究兼决策参谋机构
    本报讯  记者艾笑报道：中国预防医学科学院５年完成职能转变，由单纯科研机构成为科学研究、指导培训、监督监测、标准研制、情报交流５项全能的国家卫生管理方面的决策参谋机构。他们每年进行的３１０个左右的项目中，４０％多是国家重点或攻关项目，在全国性的流行和重大疾病防治工作中发挥了重要作用。
    对周期性暴发流行的疾病，如流脑，为了防止８０年代在全国出现发病高峰，预防医科院开展了监测、预测和控制措施的研究，使我国这一疾病发病率由１９８３年的十万分之十一，降至去年的十万分之一点六，达到有史以来的最低点。
    近５年来，全国突然暴发的疫情共３３次。他们对其中原因不明又后果严重的疾病，如纸坊病、变质甘蔗中毒、银耳中毒及成人腹泻等，都通过系统调查研究提出了诊断方法和预防对策。
    在预防疾病的研究中，他们不仅提供简易、准确和利于普及的诊断方法和试剂，还研究出相当一批防治疟疾、包虫病、钩虫病和抗病毒、抗肿瘤的新药；长达３年多的公共营养现场试点研究，使７个省的试点人群和儿童生长发育得到改善，提供了我国农村改善营养的经验。他们首次阐明了云南宣威肺癌高发的主要原因是室内燃煤空气污染，这一成果在国际上引起强烈反响。
    由于该院加强检验和提供标准，使我国进口的粮、油、糖、奶粉等食品的合格率，由１９８１年的６９％提高到９７％。
