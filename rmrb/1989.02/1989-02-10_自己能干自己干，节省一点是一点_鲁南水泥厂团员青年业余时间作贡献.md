“Do what you can yourself, save a little is a little.” This is the slogan that the Luonan Cement Factory’s Youth League Committee has put forward to all 700-plus Youth League members and young people in the factory. In one and a half years, they have saved the nation 200,000 yuan in expenditures.

Luonan Cement Factory is a key national construction project. On April 20, 1987, construction began. The factory’s Youth League Committee proposed this slogan. They used their spare time to repair high-level water tanks, install power lines, plant 2,500 trees, and save the nation over 50,000 yuan in expenditures.

In December 1987, the factory needed to build a road. Qū Fèngxiǎo, who was 25 years old at the time, discovered that the design from the design institute was not reasonable. After careful observation and repeated deliberation, he boldly changed the original design, saving 100,000 yuan in expenditures.

Last June, the living area needed to install streetlights. The factory’s Youth League Committee mobilized Youth League members and young people to do it themselves. From June to September, during the hottest summer months, a team of 43 Youth League members and young people worked in their spare time for three months, completing the task and saving 49,000 yuan in expenditures.

　　“自己能干自己干，节省一点是一点”
    鲁南水泥厂团员青年业余时间作贡献
    本报讯  “自己能干的自己干，能为国家节省一点是一点。”这是鲁南水泥厂团委，向全厂７００多位团员、青年提出的口号。一年半时间，他们先后为国家节省开支２０万元。
    鲁南水泥厂是国家重点建设项目。１９８７年４月２０日破土动工，厂团委提出这一口号。他们用业余时间，修高位水池、架输电线路、植树２５００棵等，为国家节省开支５万多元。
    １９８７年１２月，工厂要修一条公路，２５岁的曲奉晓发现设计院的设计不合理。经过观察，反复推敲，他毅然改变原设计，节省开支达１０万元。
    去年６月，生活区要架设路灯。厂团委发动团员、青年自己干。６至９月，正是夏季，４３名团员、青年组成的突击队，利用业余时间，苦干３个月，完成了任务，节省开支４．９万元。
