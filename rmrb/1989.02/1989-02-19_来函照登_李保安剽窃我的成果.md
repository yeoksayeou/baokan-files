	Letter to the Editor:
	“Li Bao'an Plagiarized My Work”

	Your newspaper's February 10, 3rd edition reported on the synthesis of "Rose Red Liquid" health incense by Li Bao'an of the Beijing Adult Education College. This is a plagiarism of my work.

	The "Rose Red Liquid" mentioned in the report is actually hawthorn seed oil. After years of research, I discovered that this substance and its composite products have the effect of killing various bacteria. Since 1978, I have used it as a bactericidal material and, after continuous improvement, developed a series of products including "Premium Bactericidal Health Incense." In 1985, this was sent by the State Science and Technology Commission to the World New Technology Invention Expo in Birmingham, UK, for exhibition; after improvement, a national patent was applied for in the same year.

	Since the autumn of 1984, Li Bao'an, originally a worker at Shougang, stole my relevant experimental reports and samples of health incense. I exposed this behavior in the *Health Daily* on March 29, 1988. Unfortunately, he recently held a press conference to deceive the public.

    “李保安剽窃我的成果”
    贵报２月１０日第３版报道的“蔷薇红液”合成卫生香，是北京市成人教育学院李保安剽窃的我的成果。
    该消息中提到的“蔷薇红液”实际上就是山楂核馏油。我经过多年钻研，发现这种物质及其综合利用制品具有杀灭多种病菌的作用。１９７８年以来，我以它为杀菌材料，经过不断改进，研制成“高级杀菌卫生香”等系列产品，１９８５年由国家科委送往在英国伯明翰举行的世界新技术发明博览会展出；改进后同年申请了国家专利。
    １９８４年秋季以来，原为首钢工人的李保安窃取了我的有关试验报告等资料和卫生香样品。对于这一行为，我１９８８年３月２９日已在《健康报》上作了揭露。不想他最近又开新闻发布会欺骗视听。 　　　　　　　　　　　　　北京卫生材料厂退休工程师　铁汉
