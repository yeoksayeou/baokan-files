The young men of the Chinese table tennis team completed a 10,000-meter physical training session on the afternoon of Chinese New Year's Eve. That evening and on the first day of the New Year, they happily but not lightly celebrated the holiday. On the second day of the New Year, they joined the women's team in intense training for the upcoming 40th World Table Tennis Championships. With only a little over a month left until the world championships, every second is precious.

After a short while of training, Li Fuhong walked into the table tennis hall. This 47-year-old veteran of the table tennis world is now the director of the State Sports Commission's Training Bureau, overseeing nearly ten national teams. However, he seems to have a particular fondness for his old profession, leaving the most footprints in the table tennis training rooms.

Coach Xu Shaofa approached Li Fuhong, ready to report on the recent training progress. Just then, Wu Shaozu, the director of the State Sports Commission, wearing a black overcoat, pushed open the door. He nodded and greeted a few familiar players like Jiang Jialiang while cupping his hands to wish the coaches and athletes a happy new year.

Wu Shaozu said to Xu Shaofa, "I just came from the men's and women's volleyball and badminton training grounds. I saw everyone training hard. For the honor of the motherland, you have sacrificed your holidays and the opportunity to be with your families. I am deeply moved. In the past, when I worked at the Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense, many researchers, soldiers, and cadres at the nuclear test base also had this spirit of devotion to their cause."

Xu Shaofa introduced the new members of the table tennis team to Wu Shaozu one by one. "The table at the far end where Jiang Jialiang is practicing with the left-handed player is Lin Zhigang; both are from Guangdong. The table closest to you, the one opposite Ma Wenge, is a smart player from Tianjin; the one wearing glasses is Xie Chaojie from Guangxi; both are participating in a world competition for the first time. Oh, the chopper practicing with Teng Yi is from the Beijing team and will not participate in the World Championships this time."

Wu Shaozu noticed the resolutions posted on the wall of the training hall and walked over to read them. Xu Shaofa explained that after several recent international competitions, the men's team faced strong challenges. The team posed the question, "How do we face these challenges?" and let everyone write and discuss their thoughts. Wu Shaozu commented as he read, "These are very good. They should be well preserved. Even after many years, they will still be meaningful to look back on." He also told Li Fuhong and Xu Shaofa, "Now, more than ever, we need to cultivate a spirit of aggression and killing intent in our athletes. Without the right spirit and morale, it will be difficult to win battles. Collective spirit and teamwork must still be advocated." Wu Shaozu heard that the table tennis team would soon go to Huangshi for intensive, closed-door training and said, "I will also go there soon to see you all and give a pre-match pep talk. I have been a political commissar in the army for many years, but I don't know if I can give a good speech this time."

After watching the men's team train for a while, Wu Shaozu went upstairs to watch the women's team train. The young men trained with even more enthusiasm, their short-sleeved shirts and shorts quickly soaked with sweat. The women upstairs were the same. The reporter saw Zhang Xiaolin and asked him about his thoughts on an article from a Shanghai newspaper a few days ago, which said that the Chinese women's table tennis team, missing three veteran players like He Zhi-li, faced an uncertain defense of the Coronation Cup. Zhang Xiaolin said, "We should thank such reminders. Whether the team, mainly composed of new players, can perform well this time is indeed uncertain, but I have full confidence in our young players."

Unknowingly, the sky darkened, and outside the training hall, the lights were on, and the streets were bustling. Occasionally, the sound of New Year's firecrackers could be heard. Inside the training hall, the lights were bright, and on each green table, the ping-pong balls flew back and forth. The table tennis athletes performed a New Year's symphony with their sweat.

　　乒乓馆里新春曲
    中国乒乓球队的小伙子农历除夕下午跑完一万米的身体训练，当晚和初一高高兴兴而又不轻松地过了个年。初二下午他们便同女队一起投入了迎接第４０届世乒赛的紧张赛前训练。距离世界大赛只有一个多月的时间了，分分秒秒是那样宝贵。
    刚练一会儿，李富荣走进乒乓球馆，这位年已４７岁的乒坛老将现任国家体委训练局局长，管着近十个项目的国家队。不过他似乎更偏爱自己的老本行，各个训练房里数乒乓球馆留下足迹最多。
    许绍发总教练走过来，正要向李富荣汇报一下最近的训练情况，穿着黑呢大衣的国家体委主任伍绍祖推门进来，边同江嘉良等几位他熟悉的名将点头招呼，边拱手向教练员和运动员们拜年。
    伍绍祖对许绍发说：“我刚从男女排球和羽毛球队的训练场地过来，看到大家都在加油地练。你们为了祖国的荣誉，牺牲了自己的节假日，放弃了与家人团聚的机会，我很受感动。过去我在国防科工委工作时，核试验基地的许多科研人员、战士、干部也是这样，具有这么一种为事业献身的精神。”
    许绍发一一向伍绍祖介绍乒乓球队的新人。“最边上那张台子和江嘉良对练的左手小将是林志刚，他俩都是广东人。离你最近的这张台子，对面是马文革，天津人，球打得很聪明；这边戴眼镜的是谢超杰，广西的，他俩都是第一次参加世界比赛。噢，那个同滕毅对练的削球手是北京队的，这次不参加世界锦标赛。”
    伍绍祖看到训练馆的墙上贴着一排决心书，走过去翻看。许绍发介绍说，最近几次国际比赛男队遇到了强硬的挑战，队里出了个题目“面对挑战我们怎么办”，让大家自己写，还一起讨论。伍绍祖边看边说：“写得很不错，这些应当好好保存着，将来过了多少年再看一看也很有意义。”他还对李富荣、许绍发说：“现在特别需要培养运动员在赛场上表现出一股冲劲和杀气，气势不足、精神面貌不对头就很难打胜仗。还有，集体主义和团结协作精神仍要提倡。”伍绍祖听说乒乓球队过几天就要拉到黄石进行大强度封闭式集训，他说：“我很快也去那里看你们，还想为你们作一次战前鼓劲讲话。在部队我当过多年政委，可是不知这次能不能讲好。”
    看了一会男队训练，伍绍祖又上楼看女队训练去了。小伙子们越练越起劲，短袖衫和短裤很快就被汗水浸湿了。楼上的女将也是一样。记者见到张燮林，问他对前两天上海某报的一篇文章有何看法，文章说，中国乒乓女队这次少了何智丽等三员老将，卫冕考比伦杯前景不乐观。张燮林说：“应当谢谢这样的提醒。以新人为主的女队这次能不能打好，确实没有很大把握，不过我对我们的年轻队员是充满信心的。”不知不觉中，天色黑下来，训练馆外华灯齐放、车水马龙，不时传来过年的鞭炮声。训练馆内灯火通明，一张张墨绿色球台上，也是劈劈啪啪，银球穿梭，乒乓健儿们用汗水演奏着新春交响曲。
