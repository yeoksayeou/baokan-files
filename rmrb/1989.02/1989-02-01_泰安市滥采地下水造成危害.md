The renowned tourist city of Tai'an, with the development of its industry, agriculture, and tourism, is facing increasing water supply issues in its urban areas. The city's daily groundwater extraction has increased from 0.7 million cubic meters in the 1950s to 7.7 million cubic meters in 1987. Over-extraction has led to a drop in groundwater levels, surface subsidence, and groundwater pollution.

It is understood that the triangular area where the Jingpu Railway and the Tai-Xin Railway intersect has experienced over 40 instances of surface subsidence. Tai'an Railway Station alone has had two subsidence incidents in one year, with the largest sinkhole measuring approximately 8 meters in diameter and 5 meters in depth. Over-extraction of groundwater has also caused cracks in some factory buildings and leaning chimneys. Over the past four years, the Tai'an Environmental Hydrology and Geology Station has analyzed and monitored over 200 water samples, revealing that the shallow groundwater in Tai'an is no longer suitable for drinking, and deep groundwater in some areas has been polluted.

Many comrades have called for: strictly controlling the amount of groundwater extracted in Tai'an's urban areas, establishing and improving water resource regulations, and rationally utilizing and developing Tai'an's groundwater resources.

　　泰安市滥采地下水造成危害
    驰名中外的旅游城市泰安，随着工农业和旅游业的发展，城区供水矛盾日益突出。这个城市水的日开采量，５０年代为０．７万立方米，１９８７年上升到７．７万立方米。过量开采，造成泰安的地下水位下降，地面塌陷，地下水污染。
    据了解，津浦铁路和泰辛铁路联线交叉的三角区，已发生地面塌陷４０多次。泰安火车站一年内就发生两处塌陷，陷坑最大口径约８米，深达５米左右。超采地下水还造成一些厂房开裂，烟囱歪斜。泰安环境水文地质站４年来对２００多个水样的分析监测结果表明，泰安浅层地下水已不宜饮用，深层地下水在部分地区已被污染。
    许多同志呼吁：严格控制泰安市区地下水开采量，建立健全水资源法规，合理利用和开发泰安市的地下水资源。　　　山东济南市历山路７４号　李现文
