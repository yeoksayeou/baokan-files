Editor's Note: Currently, there are various disagreements in the literary world regarding the value of literature. These disagreements involve how to evaluate "pure literature," the social function of literature (enlightenment consciousness), and where the achievements of literature in the new era lie. Recently, we invited Gao Ertai (Professor at Sichuan Normal University), Lei Da (Deputy Researcher at the Research Department of the Chinese Writers Association), Chen Sihuo (Lecturer at Fudan University's Chinese Department), and Wang Xiaoming (Deputy Researcher at East China Normal University) to discuss these issues. Below is a summary of this dialogue.

Literature's Social Utility and the Subjectivity of Beauty: Are They Contradictory?

Gao Ertai (hereafter referred to as Gao): Previously, when I discussed aesthetics, I emphasized that beauty is subjective. Now, when talking about literature, I emphasize the social and utilitarian aspects of literature, which seems contradictory.

In reality, although people's aesthetic activities are subjective, fundamentally, all cultural activities in human society are social and utilitarian. People appreciate a painting, listen to a song... These are all non-utilitarian activities, but behind these "games," there is still the purpose of spiritual adjustment and emotional cultivation. From a broader perspective, human aesthetics are cultural phenomena, a kind of sensory cultural force, guiding people to seek and choose the most suitable ways of living at the social and historical levels. It can be said that following the guidance of aesthetics, people will inevitably find the truth. Therefore, literary and artistic creation, as part of human aesthetic activities, must be utilitarian and aim to produce social effects. Under this premise, so-called pure beauty and abstract forms are themselves abstract worlds and spiritual dimensions, and the value of this dimension is the value of human progress. Therefore, the form of creation itself is also expanding people's spiritual life. Literary creation is the spiritual production that drives human progress. Of course, technique must be emphasized because without technique, one cannot move people. But technique is only a means, not the end. Some people advocate that the purpose of literary creation is form and technique. To a certain extent, I agree that technique is the purpose because means can only fully play their role when they are transformed into the purpose, and tools can only fully play their role when they are transformed into the purpose. But fundamentally, the form and technique of literary creation are means, not the end.

Chen Sihuo (hereafter referred to as Chen): I have a question about your theoretical views: On one hand, you say that literary creation and people's aesthetic activities are means for human progress; but when you talk about literature itself, you say that form and technique are means, while the ideological content of literature is the end...

Gao: Here, we talk about levels. The technique of literature (means) is for expressing ideality, and ideality serves to inspire human progress. If we want to distinguish levels, then technique and form are "means of means."

Chen: Do you think that literary creation is to have an idea first and then find techniques to express it?

Gao: This depends on the writer's artistic talent. For a great artist, when he has a kind of passion, he can express it naturally. He has inspiration, and he has technique; when a great artist's "idea" arises, the "idea" itself is expressive. The thought of a poet in that instant of creation already carries form. Of course, it does not exclude the possibility that sometimes a writer seeks an appropriate way to express a certain thought and emotion. Generally, inspiration, passion, thought, and technique are generated simultaneously, but the writer must have a spirit that faces reality and confronts life. If one remains indifferent to the ugliness, oppression, and pain in reality, one cannot become a true writer.

Wang Xiaoming (hereafter referred to as Wang): Many discussions cannot go deep because the conceptual levels of the dialogue are not clear. If we talk about the most fundamental level, according to Mr. Gao's view, all changes in human society are utilitarian, and I think most people will agree with this. As the Swiss writer DÃ¼rrenmatt said, the more a work is created from a non-political stance, the more political it is. I think this sentence can also be said as: the more a work is created from a non-utilitarian angle, the more utilitarian it may be. These are issues at two different levels and are actually not contradictory.

I think it is better to start from discussing specific concepts. For example, Mr. Gao often talks about the main task of contemporary Chinese literary creation being enlightenment. Can you explain what you mean by enlightenment?

Enlightenment in Contemporary Literature

Gao: "Enlightenment" today has its specific historical significance and is directed at the reality of contemporary Chinese society. Simply put, it is to let people recognize the ugly aspects of themselves through literary works and reform the national spirit. Compared to the May Fourth period, and even compared to Tan Sitong, Liang Qichao, and Qiu Jin, the task of enlightenment has many continuities, such as anti-feudal enlightenment, democratic enlightenment, and even the establishment of the personality of intellectuals, these problems have not been solved. Regarding the enlightenment issues from the May Fourth period to the present, this is another topic that needs to be deeply explored, but one thing is clear: the enlightenment that Lu Xun undertook has not been completed today.

Wang: The enlightenment that Mr. Gao mentioned should be said to be a broad cultural enlightenment. This enlightenment includes political, philosophical, and educational aspects. We can even include literacy campaigns in this category of enlightenment. But specifically to the concept of literature, what is "literary enlightenment"? This needs to be clarified.

Lei Da (hereafter referred to as Lei): I think Xiaoming's emphasis on distinguishing literary enlightenment from political, philosophical, and educational enlightenment is necessary. For literature, the most fundamental issue is still the issue of people. Based on this, I think the main trend of literature in the new era is the discovery and recasting of the national soul. In this sense, I think it is consistent with enlightenment. The establishment of this enlightenment literature trend has a realistic basis and is in line with the characteristics of the current historical stage of Chinese society. If we want to clarify the main trend of the development of literature in the new era, we should focus on this aspect. If we talk from other angles, such as realism or modernism, it is easy to drift into just a school or method; if we say the main trend is humanism, it is a philosophical concept rather than a literary one. While the rediscovery and recasting of the national soul, I think, is in line with literature because it is about "people." As for talking about enlightenment from here, I think its content is easier to explain, which is to take anti-feudalism as the core, democracy and science as the theme, criticize the negative burden accumulated in traditional national culture, reform the traditional cultural psychological structure of the people, awaken people's subjectivity, and establish a modern, healthy, and open personality. In the future period when commodity economy is increasingly developing, when various contradictions in Chinese society are intertwined in a complex manner, whether people can develop healthily and whether people will become increasingly alienated, this is a very sharp issue. And literature is in this sharp conflict to strive for the healthy development of people.

Wang: Let's go back to the original topic of "enlightenment." I think the enlightenment of the May Fourth period, that is, the enlightenment of "science and democracy," is a relatively broad concept and is not limited to literature and art. Today, when we talk about enlightenment from the perspective of writers, we should be aware that the broad enlightenment of ignorance is often not something that can be enlightened by literary means, and more needs to be relied on the whole society and non-literary means. Since we are talking about literary enlightenment, we should clarify which ignorance can be enlightened by literature.

Gao: Lu Xun once thought that literature could reform society, but later found that its effectiveness was limited and finally turned to politics, fighting with Qu Qiubai, Feng Xuefeng, and others. As for today, does literature have any meaning in taking this path? I think it does. Enlightenment is absolutely not something that literature can complete. It still needs the efforts of theory, education, and other aspects. Literature, of course, cannot replace these. It is a major theme of an era, and the completion of this theme must include literature.

Chen: I have two points of disagreement. First, I think the concept of "literary enlightenment" that Xiaoming mentioned just now is very vague. What is "literary enlightenment"? Is it to use literary means to enlighten? Or is it enlightenment within the literary realm? These are two different concepts. Broad enlightenment should be said to be not the task of literature, but the task of thought, philosophy, and education. When the masses are in a state of ignorance and backwardness, some enlightened individuals or elites among intellectuals use advanced thoughts to educate them, to awaken them, to help them get out of the state of ignorance. This is not the task of literature, but the task of thought and philosophy. If, because the cultural level of the people is low, a Diderot or Rousseau comes out and uses a set of philosophical thoughts that cannot communicate with the people, then it is necessary to use a very popular method, or so-called "literary means," that is, stories, plays, and some folk literature forms to explain and enlighten to the people. At this time, literature is only a means, and it is no longer literature itself. Second, Xiaoming mentioned "literary enlightenment." In my understanding, it should be enlightenment within the literary realm. Literature is a very high-level spiritual activity of mankind. It is the expression of people's self-knowledge and discovery through a joyful method. This activity, in itself, does not bear the task of enlightenment. Can we say that Dante's "Divine Comedy" is enlightenment? Can we say that Boccaccio's "Decameron" is a kind of enlightenment? I do not think Shakespeare's works are enlightenment, although they are humanistic, expressing the joy and self-confidence of people after the discovery of human value in that era. If it is only this point, it can also be expressed by philosophy and ethics, but it is expressed in the form of drama, in aesthetic activities. We can still experience and feel it from Shakespeare's works today, and it is only through this aesthetic method that we can obtain it. This is a very high-level spiritual activity. And these, and using literature as a tool to enlighten and educate the people, are two different things.

Lei: According to Chen's view, enlightenment is not the task of literature itself, but the task of philosophy and education. My view is that, taking the May Fourth New Culture Movement as an example, it includes political enlightenment, educational enlightenment, and philosophical enlightenment. At the same time, the May Fourth literary revolution, as part of the May Fourth New Culture Movement, also has enlightenment content. Lu Xun once said something similar, and he thought that the task of the literary revolution was two words: enlightenment. We should look at the problem from the specific national conditions of China. I think, in a sense, the era of literary aesthetics has not yet arrived in China. We, of course, hope that the more pure the beauty, the better, and we should try to exclude the interference of other utilitarian things to produce a perfect realm. But we should be soberly aware of the current cultural environment of our country and what kind of literature is needed in this environment. In recent years, after literature has been liberated from the "instrumentalism," there have been discussions about the social function of literature, the essence of art, whether China has the soil for modernism, and the current sensation of reportage literature. These issues all involve what contemporary Chinese literature should be, or what contemporary Chinese people need in literature. This is a very cruel issue. There is currently a very prominent and sharp contradiction between the literary entity and the social entity, as well as between literary aesthetics itself and the readers' realistic needs for literature. In this situation, literature is in a near-tragic, helpless state. The reality's demand for literature will be very strange. Just as our country has lost all opportunities in modern history, literature is also in a very mixed situation. We cannot start from Shakespeare's humanism and step by step go through critical realism and other stages in an orderly manner. This is impossible. In short, just as in real life, some people are engaged in modern commodity economy on the one hand and go to build tombs, build temples, and take concubines on the other hand, literature also exists in various levels of themes. It is not accurate to say that China is still in the stage of small-scale production aesthetics or has not produced the soil for modernist aesthetic interest. Using any single aesthetic standard to measure and judge is likely to be wrong.

Enlightenment Should Have Different Ways and Levels

Gao: Regarding enlightenment, there is ideological and theoretical enlightenment, and there is also a change in the way of feeling and perceiving things. Philosophical theoretical articles can change people's ideological views (of course, when ideological views change, the way of feeling will also change), but literature and art are mainly to create a new way of feeling and perceiving things, to expand people's spiritual world. So, does the writer need to have an idea first, recognize a spiritual flaw in people, and then enlighten it? This is not necessarily the case. As long as the writer is concerned about reality and is inspired by it, as long as he has an independent and advanced personality, as long as his way of feeling life, his thoughts, and emotions are at the forefront of the times, then, although his writing motivation may not be for enlightenment, he will be regarded as the spokesperson of the times, will become the trumpet that awakens a generation, and will inspire people of his time to feel the world with the same advanced way of feeling. From the writer's point of view, they do not necessarily have to consciously act as "trumpets" or "spokespersons," but the ultimate significance of their work must be reflected here.

Chen: I have some doubts about Mr. Gao's views. Is the enlightenment task you mentioned for literature or for contemporary culture as a whole? If it is for the broad cultural enlightenment, I completely agree, but if it is specifically for the literary realm, I think enlightenment should be a task in another category. First, what do you use to enlighten? Contemporary literature is in a specific situation, and in this situation, to propose an enlightenment, it cannot be a multi-level enlightenment, where you say yours, I say mineâyou want to enlighten capitalism, I want to enlighten communism, and he wants to do something about the post-industrial society... If it is this kind of enlightenment, it will not be enlightenment. In the May Fourth period, there was a very clear and unified topicâscience and democracy, but today, this situation no longer exists. It is not that the consciousness of science and democracy in China is no longer a problem, but the whole great era has changed. In the May Fourth period, China's feudal society had just ended, and a group of intellectuals, after contacting a modern civilization model from the West, hoped to bring it to China. The so-called "science and democracy" actually belongs to the category of Western modern capitalist civilization. But while China was conducting this relatively simple modern enlightenment, the world had already changed, producing new multiple values. In this multiple reaction, we cannot conduct a single democratic and scientific thought enlightenment like the May Fourth period because the value orientation has become multiple. In fact, it was also difficult to conduct a single democratic and scientific enlightenment in the May Fourth period. Lu Xun's thoughts at that time had already surpassed "democracy and science." In "The Bias of Chinese Culture," Lu Xun wrote, "Destroy materialism, promote spirituality, emphasize individuality, and oppose numerology." I think this view is standing on a position similar to Western modern trends to criticize Western capitalist civilization: it includes a critique of Western scientificism and materialism at that time, advocating the promotion of human spirit and individuality, and also expresses doubts about Western democratic republicanism. In fact, Lu Xun had already felt in 1908 that Western "democracy and science" could not save mankind, so at the beginning of the May Fourth period, he was indifferent and cold to this cultural movement. Later, although Lu Xun joined the May Fourth movement, his thoughts had surpassed the general level of "democracy and science" enlightenment thoughts at that time, and he often linked China's reality to discuss some profound issues related to man himself. Lu Xun's many new thoughts had a considerable distance from the general enlightenment thoughts at that time. By the 1980s, the multiple value systems of the contemporary world were all influencing Chinese society, and we could no longer use "democracy and science" as a single value to enlighten the multiple reality. Lei Da just listed various literary phenomena of different value levels, and they all have their realistic basis. If our literary works create a truly beautiful realm, it may not involve "democracy and science," nor directly criticize society, but it can purify and elevate people's souls, making people with dirty souls feel ashamed and moved when facing it. I think this can also be called a kind of "enlightenment," and it is a very high-level "enlightenment."

Gao: I think whether enlightenment has multiple levels, or whether enlightenment is unitary or multiple, this is not a subjective matter. The problems facing Chinese society are the obstacles of feudalism's traditional baggage to social progress, which is a basic fact and is the starting point of my so-called enlightenment. As for other aspects of "enlightenment," such as the aesthetic education mentioned by Chen Sihuo, it belongs to the category of education. So-called enlightenment is to face the common theme of the times, mobilize the people, awaken their subjectivity, and strive for social progress. Otherwise, the so-called multiple society is also impossible to achieve.

Lei: Just now, Chen talked about the enlightenment of literature to beauty, emphasizing the standard of beauty, but I found that in reality, readers have a tendency to reject literary works. The more beautifully dressed a work is, the richer and stranger the imagination, the more readers distance themselves from it. The reason is probably because the state of reality life squeezes people's spiritsâprices, official profiteering... Various social problems make people have no leisure to appreciate those beautiful things, so the "pure literature" is not welcomed by the readers. This is why I say the era of literary aesthetics has not yet arrived. We should also face such a background, that is, the aesthetic level of most Chinese readers is still relatively low, and these are pulling literature back.

Chen: Why do these phenomena occur? There are two factors here: one is that contemporary people lack training in beauty. No one is born knowing how to appreciate beauty. From childhood, we have been exposed to "Great Leap Forward" songs, the "Three Years of Natural Disasters," and the "Cultural Revolution"... These are all things that destroy and violate beauty; the second factor is more complex. There is such a reality: today, novels are more popular with the majority of readers than poetry and prose because, to some extent, novels are more popular literature. Poetry and prose, strictly speaking, are not possible to bear political missions and are expressions of the soul; to make them oppose bureaucracy and unrighteousness is not a normal way out. The main body of Chinese literature development is lyric poetry, and excellent prose is also mainly lyric prose, which is a fact. Until the May Fourth period, the main achievements of the new literature movement were first reflected in poetry and prose, but we do not feel this today. On the contrary, after the May Fourth period, a novel boom appeared, and almost everyone loved to read novels, especially today, novels have become the main tool for people to vent their emotions, and the artistic and beautiful feelings have been lost, leaving only the use of literature as a substitute for spiritual needs that cannot be obtained elsewhere, or as a social tool. If we trace the root cause, we need to reflect on the May Fourth period. At that time, progressive intellectuals, in order to awaken the masses and fight against the butterfly school, used literature as a popular tool of thought, which was out of a sense of social responsibility and the need of the times, of course, it was also appropriate. But we should also see the other side of the problem, that is, this approach itself is non-literary and even destructive to literature, gradually making our people regard literature as a tool for life venting rather than as a soul-refining, aesthetic art entity. Take Lu Xun as an example: his "Diary of a Madman" is a high-level discussion of the recognition of human beings, and the various issues of people eating people are issues of human ontology, not just social issues, and the final "Save the children" is not just a call with enlightenment significance, but is based on a very profound recognition of human ontology to save human consciousness. The place where Lu Xun's thoughts transcend the general level of thought in the May Fourth period is also here. His works can still move us and enlighten us today because they involve eternal things of mankind. The May Fourth period was to popularize and utilize these things. Feudal ethics must be opposed, and feudalism must be opposed, but these are mainly the tasks of the intellectual, educational, and philosophical circles. Of course, the literary circle can also reflect, but it should not simply act as a tool. In fact, Lu Xun's works are the best enlightenment: his "Wild Grass" writes about dreams, writes beautifully, and it is difficult to say that it is aimed at some specific thing in real life. It reflects the feelings of the soul in such a cultural collision process, and this feeling is expressed through beautiful images. This aesthetic feeling can be experienced by people for many generations, and people can always feel the soul-shaking things from "Wild Grass." If we talk about enlightenment, I think this is the enlightenment of literature. But on this point, Lu Xun is isolated, and his tradition has not been continued. Later, "literature for life" and "literature for the proletarian masses" appeared... step by step, literature was completely integrated into the track of political struggle. Under certain historical conditions, these can be seen as the needs of history and revolutionary struggle, but this is not literature, it is contradictory to literature itself. This is the relationship between art and non-art.

Readers Choose Literature, and Literature Chooses Readers

Lei: I agree with Chen Sihuo's view that readers choose literature, and literature also chooses readers; ears without musical cells cannot appreciate music. Therefore, it is necessary to first train ears that can appreciate music. However, I think we should not completely ignore the reality in which literature is located (including the state of the readers it faces) and hang a static aesthetic standard to determine what is literature and what is not. I think what is art and what is non-art, the standards in each country and each historical period are different, and it should be a dynamic concept.

Literature should also be stratified, with high and low levels, but all can be included in the category of literature, of course, there should also be qualitative boundaries. What is the standard of contemporary Chinese literature? This is a developing and changing thing, and when measuring it, we should not start from a suspended literary definition, but should observe it from a dynamic angle, and sometimes expand the definition of what is art with the changes of society.

Gao: I also think that the concept of literature should not be defined too narrowly. Literature is just one kind of art, and in my view, art is just a form of human emotional expression. This expressive form is divided into various categories due to the different materials used: using clay, copper, and stone to express is sculpture, using building materials to express is architecture, using colors to express is painting... Specifically to literature, it is the art of language. Then we return to the big concept of art, building a house is not art? The house is for living, but if it builds an eave, raises a corner, it becomes art; again, industrial art, a cup designed and made beautifully, it also has artistic value. Labor's hanging a few pieces of cloth on the wall, stacking a few things on the table, it also becomes art because these express his emotions. Su Dongpo's prose, Tagore's small poems, there is philosophy in them, and there is aesthetics, what should we call it? If the concept of literature is defined too narrowly, it is inevitable to be self-contradictory in real discussions.

Lei: In the past two years, the hot topics in the literary circle are one, returning to the literary entity, excluding non-literary factors; the other is the globalization of world literature, that is, the issue of Chinese literature going to the world. Under these two consciousnesses, there have indeed appeared a batch of works with new ideas in artistic form, but I still feel a lack of strength. Specifically, at the moment when the tide of commodity economy is coming and society is undergoing profound changes, literature has a sense of weightlessness. Of course, novel creation should have a period of aesthetic sedimentation to respond to the changes of reality. My feeling is that writers pay more attention to the return to the literary entity and Chinese literature going to the world, while they are more indifferent to interfering with the souls of people in reality. Perhaps there is also a problem of the overall cultural quality and cultural accumulation of the writer team being relatively weak.

Wang: If we talk about the mission of writers, talking about the concern of writers for reality, I think there are some premises that need to be clarified.

For example, when advocating that writers should have a sense of mission and enlighten society, we should also fully consider how to achieve it, otherwise, just shouting slogans is not meaningful. Some writers propose to pay attention to the survival status of our literary circle, that is, our real situation. In recent years, the literary circle has proposed various banners, and behind them, there is always this "survival status" problem. Those theories and slogans all avoid this fundamental problem, and for this fundamental problem, we are powerless. Like advocating irrationality, advocating the weakening of the times, or declaring no interest in social issues, behind them all is a common cause. "Weakening the times" itself is an understanding of the times, saying no interest in politics itself is also a political attitude. We can say these are empty words, but why do people still say these words? Proposing these problems themselves have strong social and even political significance. If we cannot touch this basic survival status, another situation will appear. In 1979 and 1980, many of the most advanced thoughts were first proposed by writers, but now, with the expansion of the degree of ideological liberation, many more fundamental or more acute problems cannot be said in works, that is, it is not that writers are numb, but they cannot express. If we always think about a problem but do not get a result, we will unconsciously not think about this problem. The longer we suppress our thinking, the more our sensitivity in this aspect will degenerate, to the point of thinking but not being able to say, and finally not thinking at all. Some people advocate transcendence, and we can judge their true situation from their original starting point. Of course, they will also become alienated from this, but this is not surprising.
