Editor's Note: Currently, there are various disagreements in the literary world regarding the value of literature. These disagreements involve how to evaluate "pure literature," the social function of literature (enlightenment consciousness), and where the achievements of literature in the new era lie. Recently, we invited Gao Ertai (Professor at Sichuan Normal University), Lei Da (Deputy Researcher at the Research Department of the Chinese Writers Association), Chen Sihuo (Lecturer at Fudan University's Chinese Department), and Wang Xiaoming (Deputy Researcher at East China Normal University) to discuss these issues. Below is a summary of this dialogue.

Literature's Social Utility and the Subjectivity of Beauty: Are They Contradictory?

Gao Ertai (hereafter referred to as Gao): Previously, when I discussed aesthetics, I emphasized that beauty is subjective. Now, when talking about literature, I emphasize the social and utilitarian aspects of literature, which seems contradictory.

In reality, although people's aesthetic activities are subjective, fundamentally, all cultural activities in human society are social and utilitarian. People appreciate a painting, listen to a song... These are all non-utilitarian activities, but behind these "games," there is still the purpose of spiritual adjustment and emotional cultivation. From a broader perspective, human aesthetics are cultural phenomena, a kind of sensory cultural force, guiding people to seek and choose the most suitable ways of living at the social and historical levels. It can be said that following the guidance of aesthetics, people will inevitably find the truth. Therefore, literary and artistic creation, as part of human aesthetic activities, must be utilitarian and aim to produce social effects. Under this premise, so-called pure beauty and abstract forms are themselves abstract worlds and spiritual dimensions, and the value of this dimension is the value of human progress. Therefore, the form of creation itself is also expanding people's spiritual life. Literary creation is the spiritual production that drives human progress. Of course, technique must be emphasized because without technique, one cannot move people. But technique is only a means, not the end. Some people advocate that the purpose of literary creation is form and technique. To a certain extent, I agree that technique is the purpose because means can only fully play their role when they are transformed into the purpose, and tools can only fully play their role when they are transformed into the purpose. But fundamentally, the form and technique of literary creation are means, not the end.

Chen Sihuo (hereafter referred to as Chen): I have a question about your theoretical views: On one hand, you say that literary creation and people's aesthetic activities are means for human progress; but when you talk about literature itself, you say that form and technique are means, while the ideological content of literature is the end...

Gao: Here, we talk about levels. The technique of literature (means) is for expressing ideality, and ideality serves to inspire human progress. If we want to distinguish levels, then technique and form are "means of means."

Chen: Do you think that literary creation is to have an idea first and then find techniques to express it?

Gao: This depends on the writer's artistic talent. For a great artist, when he has a kind of passion, he can express it naturally. He has inspiration, and he has technique; when a great artist's "idea" arises, the "idea" itself is expressive. The thought of a poet in that instant of creation already carries form. Of course, it does not exclude the possibility that sometimes a writer seeks an appropriate way to express a certain thought and emotion. Generally, inspiration, passion, thought, and technique are generated simultaneously, but the writer must have a spirit that faces reality and confronts life. If one remains indifferent to the ugliness, oppression, and pain in reality, one cannot become a true writer.

Wang Xiaoming (hereafter referred to as Wang): Many discussions cannot go deep because the conceptual levels of the dialogue are not clear. If we talk about the most fundamental level, according to Mr. Gao's view, all changes in human society are utilitarian, and I think most people will agree with this. As the Swiss writer Dürrenmatt said, the more a work is created from a non-political stance, the more political it is. I think this sentence can also be said as: the more a work is created from a non-utilitarian angle, the more utilitarian it may be. These are issues at two different levels and are actually not contradictory.

I think it is better to start from discussing specific concepts. For example, Mr. Gao often talks about the main task of contemporary Chinese literary creation being enlightenment. Can you explain what you mean by enlightenment?

Enlightenment in Contemporary Literature

Gao: "Enlightenment" today has its specific historical significance and is directed at the reality of contemporary Chinese society. Simply put, it is to let people recognize the ugly aspects of themselves through literary works and reform the national spirit. Compared to the May Fourth period, and even compared to Tan Sitong, Liang Qichao, and Qiu Jin, the task of enlightenment has many continuities, such as anti-feudal enlightenment, democratic enlightenment, and even the establishment of the personality of intellectuals, these problems have not been solved. Regarding the enlightenment issues from the May Fourth period to the present, this is another topic that needs to be deeply explored, but one thing is clear: the enlightenment that Lu Xun undertook has not been completed today.

Wang: The enlightenment that Mr. Gao mentioned should be said to be a broad cultural enlightenment. This enlightenment includes political, philosophical, and educational aspects. We can even include literacy campaigns in this category of enlightenment. But specifically to the concept of literature, what is "literary enlightenment"? This needs to be clarified.

Lei Da (hereafter referred to as Lei): I think Xiaoming's emphasis on distinguishing literary enlightenment from political, philosophical, and educational enlightenment is necessary. For literature, the most fundamental issue is still the issue of people. Based on this, I think the main trend of literature in the new era is the discovery and recasting of the national soul. In this sense, I think it is consistent with enlightenment. The establishment of this enlightenment literature trend has a realistic basis and is in line with the characteristics of the current historical stage of Chinese society. If we want to clarify the main trend of the development of literature in the new era, we should focus on this aspect. If we talk from other angles, such as realism or modernism, it is easy to drift into just a school or method; if we say the main trend is humanism, it is a philosophical concept rather than a literary one. While the rediscovery and recasting of the national soul, I think, is in line with literature because it is about "people." As for talking about enlightenment from here, I think its content is easier to explain, which is to take anti-feudalism as the core, democracy and science as the theme, criticize the negative burden accumulated in traditional national culture, reform the traditional cultural psychological structure of the people, awaken people's subjectivity, and establish a modern, healthy, and open personality. In the future period when commodity economy is increasingly developing, when various contradictions in Chinese society are intertwined in a complex manner, whether people can develop healthily and whether people will become increasingly alienated, this is a very sharp issue. And literature is in this sharp conflict to strive for the healthy development of people.

Wang: Let's go back to the original topic of "enlightenment." I think the enlightenment of the May Fourth period, that is, the enlightenment of "science and democracy," is a relatively broad concept and is not limited to literature and art. Today, when we talk about enlightenment from the perspective of writers, we should be aware that the broad enlightenment of ignorance is often not something that can be enlightened by literary means, and more needs to be relied on the whole society and non-literary means. Since we are talking about literary enlightenment, we should clarify which ignorance can be enlightened by literature.

Gao: Lu Xun once thought that literature could reform society, but later found that its effectiveness was limited and finally turned to politics, fighting with Qu Qiubai, Feng Xuefeng, and others. As for today, does literature have any meaning in taking this path? I think it does. Enlightenment is absolutely not something that literature can complete. It still needs the efforts of theory, education, and other aspects. Literature, of course, cannot replace these. It is a major theme of an era, and the completion of this theme must include literature.

Chen: I have two points of disagreement. First, I think the concept of "literary enlightenment" that Xiaoming mentioned just now is very vague. What is "literary enlightenment"? Is it to use literary means to enlighten? Or is it enlightenment within the literary realm? These are two different concepts. Broad enlightenment should be said to be not the task of literature, but the task of thought, philosophy, and education. When the masses are in a state of ignorance and backwardness, some enlightened individuals or elites among intellectuals use advanced thoughts to educate them, to awaken them, to help them get out of the state of ignorance. This is not the task of literature, but the task of thought and philosophy. If, because the cultural level of the people is low, a Diderot or Rousseau comes out and uses a set of philosophical thoughts that cannot communicate with the people, then it is necessary to use a very popular method, or so-called "literary means," that is, stories, plays, and some folk literature forms to explain and enlighten to the people. At this time, literature is only a means, and it is no longer literature itself. Second, Xiaoming mentioned "literary enlightenment." In my understanding, it should be enlightenment within the literary realm. Literature is a very high-level spiritual activity of mankind. It is the expression of people's self-knowledge and discovery through a joyful method. This activity, in itself, does not bear the task of enlightenment. Can we say that Dante's "Divine Comedy" is enlightenment? Can we say that Boccaccio's "Decameron" is a kind of enlightenment? I do not think Shakespeare's works are enlightenment, although they are humanistic, expressing the joy and self-confidence of people after the discovery of human value in that era. If it is only this point, it can also be expressed by philosophy and ethics, but it is expressed in the form of drama, in aesthetic activities. We can still experience and feel it from Shakespeare's works today, and it is only through this aesthetic method that we can obtain it. This is a very high-level spiritual activity. And these, and using literature as a tool to enlighten and educate the people, are two different things.

Lei: According to Chen's view, enlightenment is not the task of literature itself, but the task of philosophy and education. My view is that, taking the May Fourth New Culture Movement as an example, it includes political enlightenment, educational enlightenment, and philosophical enlightenment. At the same time, the May Fourth literary revolution, as part of the May Fourth New Culture Movement, also has enlightenment content. Lu Xun once said something similar, and he thought that the task of the literary revolution was two words: enlightenment. We should look at the problem from the specific national conditions of China. I think, in a sense, the era of literary aesthetics has not yet arrived in China. We, of course, hope that the more pure the beauty, the better, and we should try to exclude the interference of other utilitarian things to produce a perfect realm. But we should be soberly aware of the current cultural environment of our country and what kind of literature is needed in this environment. In recent years, after literature has been liberated from the "instrumentalism," there have been discussions about the social function of literature, the essence of art, whether China has the soil for modernism, and the current sensation of reportage literature. These issues all involve what contemporary Chinese literature should be, or what contemporary Chinese people need in literature. This is a very cruel issue. There is currently a very prominent and sharp contradiction between the literary entity and the social entity, as well as between literary aesthetics itself and the readers' realistic needs for literature. In this situation, literature is in a near-tragic, helpless state. The reality's demand for literature will be very strange. Just as our country has lost all opportunities in modern history, literature is also in a very mixed situation. We cannot start from Shakespeare's humanism and step by step go through critical realism and other stages in an orderly manner. This is impossible. In short, just as in real life, some people are engaged in modern commodity economy on the one hand and go to build tombs, build temples, and take concubines on the other hand, literature also exists in various levels of themes. It is not accurate to say that China is still in the stage of small-scale production aesthetics or has not produced the soil for modernist aesthetic interest. Using any single aesthetic standard to measure and judge is likely to be wrong.

Enlightenment Should Have Different Ways and Levels

Gao: Regarding enlightenment, there is ideological and theoretical enlightenment, and there is also a change in the way of feeling and perceiving things. Philosophical theoretical articles can change people's ideological views (of course, when ideological views change, the way of feeling will also change), but literature and art are mainly to create a new way of feeling and perceiving things, to expand people's spiritual world. So, does the writer need to have an idea first, recognize a spiritual flaw in people, and then enlighten it? This is not necessarily the case. As long as the writer is concerned about reality and is inspired by it, as long as he has an independent and advanced personality, as long as his way of feeling life, his thoughts, and emotions are at the forefront of the times, then, although his writing motivation may not be for enlightenment, he will be regarded as the spokesperson of the times, will become the trumpet that awakens a generation, and will inspire people of his time to feel the world with the same advanced way of feeling. From the writer's point of view, they do not necessarily have to consciously act as "trumpets" or "spokespersons," but the ultimate significance of their work must be reflected here.

Chen: I have some doubts about Mr. Gao's views. Is the enlightenment task you mentioned for literature or for contemporary culture as a whole? If it is for the broad cultural enlightenment, I completely agree, but if it is specifically for the literary realm, I think enlightenment should be a task in another category. First, what do you use to enlighten? Contemporary literature is in a specific situation, and in this situation, to propose an enlightenment, it cannot be a multi-level enlightenment, where you say yours, I say mine—you want to enlighten capitalism, I want to enlighten communism, and he wants to do something about the post-industrial society... If it is this kind of enlightenment, it will not be enlightenment. In the May Fourth period, there was a very clear and unified topic—science and democracy, but today, this situation no longer exists. It is not that the consciousness of science and democracy in China is no longer a problem, but the whole great era has changed. In the May Fourth period, China's feudal society had just ended, and a group of intellectuals, after contacting a modern civilization model from the West, hoped to bring it to China. The so-called "science and democracy" actually belongs to the category of Western modern capitalist civilization. But while China was conducting this relatively simple modern enlightenment, the world had already changed, producing new multiple values. In this multiple reaction, we cannot conduct a single democratic and scientific thought enlightenment like the May Fourth period because the value orientation has become multiple. In fact, it was also difficult to conduct a single democratic and scientific enlightenment in the May Fourth period. Lu Xun's thoughts at that time had already surpassed "democracy and science." In "The Bias of Chinese Culture," Lu Xun wrote, "Destroy materialism, promote spirituality, emphasize individuality, and oppose numerology." I think this view is standing on a position similar to Western modern trends to criticize Western capitalist civilization: it includes a critique of Western scientificism and materialism at that time, advocating the promotion of human spirit and individuality, and also expresses doubts about Western democratic republicanism. In fact, Lu Xun had already felt in 1908 that Western "democracy and science" could not save mankind, so at the beginning of the May Fourth period, he was indifferent and cold to this cultural movement. Later, although Lu Xun joined the May Fourth movement, his thoughts had surpassed the general level of "democracy and science" enlightenment thoughts at that time, and he often linked China's reality to discuss some profound issues related to man himself. Lu Xun's many new thoughts had a considerable distance from the general enlightenment thoughts at that time. By the 1980s, the multiple value systems of the contemporary world were all influencing Chinese society, and we could no longer use "democracy and science" as a single value to enlighten the multiple reality. Lei Da just listed various literary phenomena of different value levels, and they all have their realistic basis. If our literary works create a truly beautiful realm, it may not involve "democracy and science," nor directly criticize society, but it can purify and elevate people's souls, making people with dirty souls feel ashamed and moved when facing it. I think this can also be called a kind of "enlightenment," and it is a very high-level "enlightenment."

Gao: I think whether enlightenment has multiple levels, or whether enlightenment is unitary or multiple, this is not a subjective matter. The problems facing Chinese society are the obstacles of feudalism's traditional baggage to social progress, which is a basic fact and is the starting point of my so-called enlightenment. As for other aspects of "enlightenment," such as the aesthetic education mentioned by Chen Sihuo, it belongs to the category of education. So-called enlightenment is to face the common theme of the times, mobilize the people, awaken their subjectivity, and strive for social progress. Otherwise, the so-called multiple society is also impossible to achieve.

Lei: Just now, Chen talked about the enlightenment of literature to beauty, emphasizing the standard of beauty, but I found that in reality, readers have a tendency to reject literary works. The more beautifully dressed a work is, the richer and stranger the imagination, the more readers distance themselves from it. The reason is probably because the state of reality life squeezes people's spirits—prices, official profiteering... Various social problems make people have no leisure to appreciate those beautiful things, so the "pure literature" is not welcomed by the readers. This is why I say the era of literary aesthetics has not yet arrived. We should also face such a background, that is, the aesthetic level of most Chinese readers is still relatively low, and these are pulling literature back.

Chen: Why do these phenomena occur? There are two factors here: one is that contemporary people lack training in beauty. No one is born knowing how to appreciate beauty. From childhood, we have been exposed to "Great Leap Forward" songs, the "Three Years of Natural Disasters," and the "Cultural Revolution"... These are all things that destroy and violate beauty; the second factor is more complex. There is such a reality: today, novels are more popular with the majority of readers than poetry and prose because, to some extent, novels are more popular literature. Poetry and prose, strictly speaking, are not possible to bear political missions and are expressions of the soul; to make them oppose bureaucracy and unrighteousness is not a normal way out. The main body of Chinese literature development is lyric poetry, and excellent prose is also mainly lyric prose, which is a fact. Until the May Fourth period, the main achievements of the new literature movement were first reflected in poetry and prose, but we do not feel this today. On the contrary, after the May Fourth period, a novel boom appeared, and almost everyone loved to read novels, especially today, novels have become the main tool for people to vent their emotions, and the artistic and beautiful feelings have been lost, leaving only the use of literature as a substitute for spiritual needs that cannot be obtained elsewhere, or as a social tool. If we trace the root cause, we need to reflect on the May Fourth period. At that time, progressive intellectuals, in order to awaken the masses and fight against the butterfly school, used literature as a popular tool of thought, which was out of a sense of social responsibility and the need of the times, of course, it was also appropriate. But we should also see the other side of the problem, that is, this approach itself is non-literary and even destructive to literature, gradually making our people regard literature as a tool for life venting rather than as a soul-refining, aesthetic art entity. Take Lu Xun as an example: his "Diary of a Madman" is a high-level discussion of the recognition of human beings, and the various issues of people eating people are issues of human ontology, not just social issues, and the final "Save the children" is not just a call with enlightenment significance, but is based on a very profound recognition of human ontology to save human consciousness. The place where Lu Xun's thoughts transcend the general level of thought in the May Fourth period is also here. His works can still move us and enlighten us today because they involve eternal things of mankind. The May Fourth period was to popularize and utilize these things. Feudal ethics must be opposed, and feudalism must be opposed, but these are mainly the tasks of the intellectual, educational, and philosophical circles. Of course, the literary circle can also reflect, but it should not simply act as a tool. In fact, Lu Xun's works are the best enlightenment: his "Wild Grass" writes about dreams, writes beautifully, and it is difficult to say that it is aimed at some specific thing in real life. It reflects the feelings of the soul in such a cultural collision process, and this feeling is expressed through beautiful images. This aesthetic feeling can be experienced by people for many generations, and people can always feel the soul-shaking things from "Wild Grass." If we talk about enlightenment, I think this is the enlightenment of literature. But on this point, Lu Xun is isolated, and his tradition has not been continued. Later, "literature for life" and "literature for the proletarian masses" appeared... step by step, literature was completely integrated into the track of political struggle. Under certain historical conditions, these can be seen as the needs of history and revolutionary struggle, but this is not literature, it is contradictory to literature itself. This is the relationship between art and non-art.

Readers Choose Literature, and Literature Chooses Readers

Lei: I agree with Chen Sihuo's view that readers choose literature, and literature also chooses readers; ears without musical cells cannot appreciate music. Therefore, it is necessary to first train ears that can appreciate music. However, I think we should not completely ignore the reality in which literature is located (including the state of the readers it faces) and hang a static aesthetic standard to determine what is literature and what is not. I think what is art and what is non-art, the standards in each country and each historical period are different, and it should be a dynamic concept.

Literature should also be stratified, with high and low levels, but all can be included in the category of literature, of course, there should also be qualitative boundaries. What is the standard of contemporary Chinese literature? This is a developing and changing thing, and when measuring it, we should not start from a suspended literary definition, but should observe it from a dynamic angle, and sometimes expand the definition of what is art with the changes of society.

Gao: I also think that the concept of literature should not be defined too narrowly. Literature is just one kind of art, and in my view, art is just a form of human emotional expression. This expressive form is divided into various categories due to the different materials used: using clay, copper, and stone to express is sculpture, using building materials to express is architecture, using colors to express is painting... Specifically to literature, it is the art of language. Then we return to the big concept of art, building a house is not art? The house is for living, but if it builds an eave, raises a corner, it becomes art; again, industrial art, a cup designed and made beautifully, it also has artistic value. Labor's hanging a few pieces of cloth on the wall, stacking a few things on the table, it also becomes art because these express his emotions. Su Dongpo's prose, Tagore's small poems, there is philosophy in them, and there is aesthetics, what should we call it? If the concept of literature is defined too narrowly, it is inevitable to be self-contradictory in real discussions.

Lei: In the past two years, the hot topics in the literary circle are one, returning to the literary entity, excluding non-literary factors; the other is the globalization of world literature, that is, the issue of Chinese literature going to the world. Under these two consciousnesses, there have indeed appeared a batch of works with new ideas in artistic form, but I still feel a lack of strength. Specifically, at the moment when the tide of commodity economy is coming and society is undergoing profound changes, literature has a sense of weightlessness. Of course, novel creation should have a period of aesthetic sedimentation to respond to the changes of reality. My feeling is that writers pay more attention to the return to the literary entity and Chinese literature going to the world, while they are more indifferent to interfering with the souls of people in reality. Perhaps there is also a problem of the overall cultural quality and cultural accumulation of the writer team being relatively weak.

Wang: If we talk about the mission of writers, talking about the concern of writers for reality, I think there are some premises that need to be clarified.

For example, when advocating that writers should have a sense of mission and enlighten society, we should also fully consider how to achieve it, otherwise, just shouting slogans is not meaningful. Some writers propose to pay attention to the survival status of our literary circle, that is, our real situation. In recent years, the literary circle has proposed various banners, and behind them, there is always this "survival status" problem. Those theories and slogans all avoid this fundamental problem, and for this fundamental problem, we are powerless. Like advocating irrationality, advocating the weakening of the times, or declaring no interest in social issues, behind them all is a common cause. "Weakening the times" itself is an understanding of the times, saying no interest in politics itself is also a political attitude. We can say these are empty words, but why do people still say these words? Proposing these problems themselves have strong social and even political significance. If we cannot touch this basic survival status, another situation will appear. In 1979 and 1980, many of the most advanced thoughts were first proposed by writers, but now, with the expansion of the degree of ideological liberation, many more fundamental or more acute problems cannot be said in works, that is, it is not that writers are numb, but they cannot express. If we always think about a problem but do not get a result, we will unconsciously not think about this problem. The longer we suppress our thinking, the more our sensitivity in this aspect will degenerate, to the point of thinking but not being able to say, and finally not thinking at all. Some people advocate transcendence, and we can judge their true situation from their original starting point. Of course, they will also become alienated from this, but this is not surprising.

　　评论家对话：文学的价值观
    编者按：当前，文坛上关于文学的价值观问题存在诸多分歧，这些分歧涉及到如何评价“纯文学”、文学的社会功能（启蒙意识）以及新时期文学的成就体现在哪里等问题。最近，我们邀请高尔泰（四川师范大学教授）、雷达（中国作协创研部副研究员）、陈思和（复旦大学中文系教师）、王晓明（上海华东师范大学副研究员）四位评论家就这些问题进行了对话。下面发表的是这次对话的摘要。
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    　　　　文学的社会性功利性同美的主观性是否矛盾
    高尔泰（以下简称高）：以前我谈美学的时候，强调美是主观的；现在谈文学，我又强调文学的社会性、功利性，这似乎有些矛盾。
    实际上，人的审美活动虽然是主观的，但从根本上讲，人类社会的一切文化活动，都是具有社会性、功利性的。人们欣赏一幅画，听一首歌曲……这些虽然都是非功利的，但在这些“游戏”后面，仍然有调剂精神、陶冶性情的目的。从更大的角度来说，人的美感是文化范畴的东西，是一种感性文化动力，它使人们在社会、历史的层面上寻求、选择最适宜人生存的方式，可以说，遵循美感的引导，人们得到的必然是真理。所以，文学艺术创作作为人类审美活动的一部分，必然是带有功利性的，是要产生社会效果的。在这个前提下，所谓纯粹的美的形式、抽象的形式，它本身就是一个抽象的世界、一种精神的纬度，这个纬度的价值就是人类进步的价值。因此，创作形式本身，也是在开拓人的精神生活。文学创作是推动人类进步的精神生产。当然，这里也要强调技巧，因为没有技巧就不能打动人。但技巧只是手段而不是目的。有些人主张文学创作的目的就在于形式、技巧。在一定意义上，我也同意技巧就是目的，因为手段只有转化为目的才能充分发挥手段的作用，工具只有转化为目的才能充分发挥工具的效能。但从根本意义上说，文学创作的形式、技巧是手段而不是目的。
    陈思和（以下简称陈）：我对您的理论观点存在这样一个疑问：一方面您说文学创作及人的审美活动对于人类的进步来说是手段；但您在谈到文学本身的时候又认为形式、技巧是手段，而文学的思想内容是目的……
    高：这里就讲层次性了。文学的技巧（手段）是为表现思想性，思想性是为激励人类进步服务的。如果要分清层次的话，技巧、形式就是“手段的手段”。
    陈：您认为文学创作是有了思想，再找技巧来表现它吗？
    高：这就跟作家的艺术才能有关了。对大艺术家来说，当他有一种激情产生的时候，能自然而然地表现出来，他有了灵感，就有了技巧；当大艺术家的“思想”产生的时候，“思想”本身就带有表现性了。诗人产生的那一瞬间的思想，其本身就带着形式了。当然也不排除有时作家为表达某种思想感情而寻找恰当的表达方式。一般来说，灵感、激情中包含的思想、技巧是同时产生的，但作家必须有面向现实，直面人生的精神。面对现实中的丑恶、压迫、痛苦无动于衷，就成不了真正的文学家。
    王晓明（以下简称王）：现在很多讨论所以深入不下去，主要是对话的概念层次没分清楚。如果从最根本的意义上讲，按高先生的说法，一切人类的变化都是有功利性的，我想这个观点大多数人都会同意的。正如瑞士作家迪仑马特说过的，越是从非政治的立场出发创作的作品，越具有政治性。我认为这句话也可以说成，越是从非功利的角度出发创作的作品，可能越具有功利性。这都是两个层次上的问题，其实不矛盾。
    我认为不妨先从讨论具体的概念入手。比如高先生经常谈到的，当代中国文学创作的主要任务是启蒙，那么您能否解释一下，您所谓的启蒙具体是指什么？
    　　　　关于“文学启蒙”的含义的理解
    高：“启蒙”在今天，有它特定的时代含义，是针对今天中国社会的现实而言的。简单地说，就是让人们通过文学作品认清自己身上的丑陋的东西，改造国民的精神素质。跟“五四”时期相比，甚至跟谭嗣同、梁启超、秋瑾那时比，“启蒙”的课题有很多仍是一贯延续的，比如反封建的启蒙、民主的启蒙，以至于知识分子自身人格的确立，这些问题都没解决。关于“五四”至今有关这些启蒙的问题，是另一个需要深入探讨的专题，但有一点是明确的，鲁迅从事的启蒙，今天远未完成。
    王：高先生所说的启蒙应该说是广义的文化上的启蒙，这种启蒙包含了政治上的、哲学上的、教育上的，我们甚至可以把扫盲也算作是这种启蒙范畴里的。但具体到文学这个概念上，“文学的启蒙”是什么，应该搞清楚。
    雷达（以下简称雷）：我认为晓明强调区分文学的启蒙与政治、哲学、教育上的启蒙是必要的。对文学来说，最根本的问题还是人的问题，基于这一点，我认为新时期文学的主潮就是对民族灵魂的发现与重铸。从这个意义上，我觉得它与启蒙又是一致的。这种带有启蒙性的文学主潮的确立，有着现实依据，它符合中国社会当前所处历史阶段的特征。如果要明确新时期文学发展主潮的话，应从这方面着眼。假如从其他角度，比如说现实主义或现代主义等等，很容易扯到仅仅是一个流派或手法上面；如果说主潮是人道主义的，它又是一个哲学概念而非文学的。而民族灵魂的重新发现和重新铸造，我以为是合乎文学的，因为它是针对“人”而言的。至于从这里说到启蒙，我认为它的内容就比较容易讲清楚了，就是以反封建为核心，以民主和科学为主题，批判民族传统文化积累下的消极负担，改造国民的传统文化心理结构，唤醒人们的主体意识，建立一种现代的、健全的、开放的人格。在今后商品经济日益发展的时期，在中国社会各种矛盾错综复杂地纠葛在一起的情况下，人是否能健全地发展，人是否会日益异化，这是个很尖锐的问题。而文学就是在这种尖锐的矛盾冲突中去争取人的健全发展。
    王：我们还回到原来的“启蒙”话题上。我认为“五四”时的启蒙，即“科学、民主”的启蒙，是比较宽泛的概念，不仅属于文艺。今天我们从文学家的角度谈启蒙，就要清醒地意识到，广义上的蒙昧，很多是无法用文学的手段来启的，更多是要依靠整个社会和非文学的手段。既然是谈文学的启蒙，就要弄明白哪些蒙昧可用文学来启发。
    高：鲁迅曾经以为文学可以改造社会，后来发现效能很有限，最终走向了政治，与瞿秋白、冯雪峰等一同战斗了。至于今天，文学再走这条道路还有没有意义？我认为有意义。启蒙绝对不是文学所能完成的，它还有待于理论、教育等各方面的奋斗，文学当然取代不了这些。它是一个时代的大主题，这个主题的完成是必须有文学参加的。
    陈：我谈两点不同意见。首先，我觉得晓明刚才谈到的“文学的启蒙”这个概念很含糊。什么是“文学的启蒙”？是用文学的手段来启蒙？还是文学范畴里的启蒙？这是两个不同的概念。广义的启蒙应该说不是文学的任务，它是思想的、哲学的、教育的任务。当大众处在愚昧、落后状态的时候，需要一些先知先觉者或者知识分子中的精英，用先进的思想去教育他们，去唤醒他们，使他们从愚昧状态中摆脱出来，这不是文学的任务，是思想、哲学的任务。如果因为人民大众的文化水平低，出来一个狄德罗或卢梭，用一整套哲学思想没法跟人民沟通，这时就需要用一种很通俗的手法，或者说用所谓“文学的手段”，即故事、戏剧及一些民族民间文学的形式去向人民解说、启蒙，这时，文学只不过是一种手段而已，它已经不是文学本身了。第二，刚才晓明谈到“文学的启蒙”，按我的理解应该是文学范畴里的启蒙。文学是人类一种很高层次上的精神活动。它是人们用一种欢娱的方法表达出来的对自我的认识与发现。这种活动从其本身来说是不承担启蒙任务的。能说但丁的《神曲》是启蒙吗？能说薄迦丘的《十日谈》是一种启蒙吗？莎士比亚的作品我也不认为是启蒙的，虽然它是人文主义的，表现了那个时代对人的价值发现之后的欢娱和对人的自信心，如果仅仅是这一点的话，也可以用哲学、伦理学去表达，但它是用戏剧的方式，用审美活动表现出来的，我们今天仍然能从莎士比亚作品中体验、感受得到，也只是用这种审美方式才能获得，这是一种很高层次的精神活动。而这些，和把文艺当成一种工具去启发、教育人民，完全是两码事。
    雷：按照思和的观点，启蒙不是文学本身的任务，应是哲学、教育的任务。我的看法是，拿“五四”新文化运动来说，它包括政治上的启蒙、教育上的启蒙，哲学上的启蒙，同时，“五四”文学革命作为“五四”新文化运动整体的一部分，也具有启蒙的内容。鲁迅说过类似的话，他所认为的文学革命的任务就是两个字：启蒙。我们看问题还得从中国具体的国情出发。我认为从某种意义上说，文学的审美时代在中国还没有到来。我们当然希望美的东西越纯粹越好，应当尽可能排除其它功利的东西的干预，使之产生一个完美的境界。但我们应当清醒地估计到我们国家目前所处的文化环境，和这个环境下需要什么样的文学。这些年文学从“工具论”中解放出来以后，有过关于文学的社会功能问题、艺术的本质问题、中国有没有现代派的土壤问题，以及现在报告文学的轰动问题等争论，这些问题都涉及到中国当代文学应该是什么样子、或者说当代中国民众需要什么样的文学，这是个很无情的问题。现在有个很突出而尖锐的矛盾就是文学本体和社会本体的冲突，以及文学审美本身和读者对文学的现实需求之间的矛盾。在这种局面里，文学处在一种近乎可悲的无可奈何的状态，现实对文学的需求会是非常奇特的。就像我们的国家在近代史上失去了一切机会一样，文学也处在一种很混杂的处境，我们不能再从莎士比亚的人文主义开始，一步一步地经过批判现实主义等阶段按部就班地来，这不可能。总之，就像现实生活中有人一方面从事现代商品经济另一方面又去修坟造庙纳妾一样，文学也存在着各种层次的主题，笼统地说中国仍处在小生产的审美阶段或者说还没有产生现代派审美意趣的土壤都不准确。拿任何一种单一的审美尺度去衡量、判断都是可能失误的。
    　　　　启蒙应该有不同的方式和不同层次
    高：就启蒙而言，有思想理论观点上的启蒙，也有情感方式、对事物的感受方式的改变。哲学理论文章可以使人的思想观点发生改变（当然，思想观点改变了，情感方式也会跟着变），但文学艺术则主要是创造一种新的对事物的感受方式和情感方式，去开拓人们的精神世界。那么作家是不是要先有一种想法，认识到人们精神上的一种缺点，再针对它启蒙呢？这倒未必。只要作家对现实生活是关注的，并由此而发生激情，只要他有独立而先进的人格，只要他对生活的感受方式，他的思想、情感是处在时代的前列，那么，虽然他的写作动机不一定是为了启蒙，但他会被视为时代的代言人，会成为唤醒一代人觉醒的号角，会引发他这个时代的人以同样先进的情感方式去感受世界。从作家的角度来说，他们不一定要有意识地去充当“号角”、“代言人”，但他们的工作的最终意义必然要体现在这里。
    陈：我对高先生的看法有点疑问。您所说的启蒙任务是文学的，还是整个当代文化的？如果是指广泛的文化启蒙，我完全同意，但要具体到文学的范畴里谈，我认为启蒙应该是另一个范畴里的任务。首先，您要拿什么东西来启蒙？当代文学是处在一种具体的状况，在这种现状下提出一个启蒙，它不可能是一个多层次的启蒙，不能你说你的，我说我的——你要进行资本主义的启蒙，我要进行共产主义的，他又要搞什么后工业社会的……如果是这种启蒙就不成其为启蒙了。“五四”时期有一个非常明确而划一的课题——科学、民主，而今天，这种情况已不存在了，倒不是说科学与民主意识在中国已不成问题了，而是整个大时代变化了。“五四”时期是中国封建社会刚刚结束，一批知识分子从西方接触到一种近代文明的模式，然后希望将之搬到中国来。所谓“科学与民主”实际上是属于西方近代资本主义文明的范畴。但就在中国进行这种比较单纯的近代启蒙的同时，世界已经发生了变化，产生了新的多元的价值。在这种多重反应中，我们不可能再像“五四”时期那样进行某种单一的民主与科学的思想启蒙，因为价值取向已是多元的了。其实在“五四”时期也很难实行单一的民主与科学的启蒙。鲁迅的思想在当时就已经超越了“民主与科学”。在《文化偏至伦》里，鲁迅就写到“掊物质，张灵明，任个人，排种数。”我认为这种观点是站在一种类同于西方现代思潮的立场上对西方资本主义文明的批判：它包括了对西方当时科学主义、物质主义的批判，提倡张扬人的精神、人的个性，也表现出对西方民主共和制的怀疑。实际上鲁迅在１９０８年就已从当时西方现代思潮中感觉到西方的“民主与科学”不能救人类，所以在“五四”一开始时，他对这场文化运动是膈膜、冷漠的。后来鲁迅虽然加入到“五四”运动中来，但他的思想是超越了当时一般的“民主与科学”这些资本主义启蒙思想水平的，他经常是联系中国的现实来谈一些有关人本身的深刻问题，鲁迅提出的许多新的思想与当时一般的启蒙思想是有相当距离的。到了８０年代，当代世界多元的价值体系都在对中国社会产生着影响，我们就不可能拿“民主与科学”这样一种单一的价值来对多元的现实进行启蒙。刚才雷达就列举过各种价值层次的文学现象，它们的价值层次都不一样，而且都有其存在的现实依据。如果我们的文学作品营造出一个真正美的境界，它或许涉及不到“民主与科学”，也不对社会做什么直接的批判，但它能净化、升华人们的灵魂，能使灵魂肮脏的人面对它感到愧疚，受到感动，我认为这也可以说成是一种“启蒙”，而且是很高层次的“启蒙”。
    高：我认为，启蒙有多少个层次，或者说启蒙是单元的还是多元的，这不是一个主观的东西。中国社会面临的问题，是封建主义的传统包袱对社会进步的阻碍，这是个基本的事实，也是我所谓启蒙的出发点。至于说其他方面的“启蒙”，诸如陈思和所说的美育等，就属于教育的范畴了。所谓启蒙，就是要面对共同的时代主题，动员人民，唤醒他们的主体意识，争取社会进步。否则，所谓多元化的社会也是无法实现的。
    雷：刚才思和谈到文学对美的启蒙，强调美的价值标准，而我发现，现实却是读者有种排斥文学性的倾向。作品打扮得越精致，想象力越丰富、奇特，读者却越与之疏远。这原因大概是因为现实生活的状况对人们精神的挤压——物价、官倒……各种社会问题使人们没有闲情逸致去欣赏那些精美的东西，所以“纯文学”的冷遇不能全怪作家。这也就是为什么我说文学的审美时代还没到来。我们还应正视这样一个背景，就是中国大部分读者的审美水平还比较低，这些都在拽着文学的后腿。
    陈：为什么会产生这些现象？这里有两个因素：一个是当代的人民缺少美的训练。没有人天生就会欣赏美。我们从小就接触的是大跃进民歌、是“三年自然灾害”和“文化大革命”……这些都是摧毁美、违背美的事物；第二个因素比较复杂。有这样一个现实：今天，小说比诗歌和散文要受大多数读者的欢迎，因为从某种意义上讲，小说比起诗和散文来，是更通俗的文学。诗和散文严格地说都是不可能负担政治使命的，都是一种抒发性灵的东西；要它们去反官僚主义、反不正之风毕竟不是正常的出路。中国文学发展的主体是抒情诗，优秀的散文也是以抒情散文为主的，这是事实。直到“五四”，新文学运动的主要成就也首先体现在诗歌和散文上，但我们今天却感受不到这点。相反，“五四”以后出现了一个小说高潮，几乎所有的人都爱读小说，特别到今天，小说已经成为人们最主要的宣泄工具，艺术的、美的感受丧失了，只剩下把文学当成在其他地方得不到的精神需求的补偿，或者当成社会工具。如果要究其根源，需要对“五四”进行反思。当时进步的知识分子为了唤醒民众，为了和鸳鸯蝴蝶派斗争，把文学作为一种通俗的思想工具，这是出于社会责任感，是时代的需要，当然也是应该的。但我们也要看到问题的另一面，就是这种作法本身是非文学的，甚至对文学是破坏的，它渐渐使得我们的民众把文学看成是一种人生宣泄的工具，而不是当成陶冶心灵的、审美的艺术本体。拿鲁迅来做例子：他的《狂人日记》是在一种很高层次上谈对人类本体的认识，里面有关人吃人种种，都是人类本体学的问题，不仅是社会学的问题，最后的“救救孩子”也并不是一个仅有启蒙意义的呼喊，而是基于对人类本体一种很深刻的认识去拯救人类的意识。鲁迅的思想超越“五四”时期一般的思想水平的地方，也就在这里。他的作品今天仍能感动我们，启发我们，因为它们是涉及到人类的永恒的东西。“五四”就是把这些东西通俗化、功利化了。礼教当然要反，封建主义当然要反，但这些主要是思想界、教育界、哲学界的任务。当然文学界也可以反映，但不应该是简单地充当工具。其实，鲁迅的作品就是最好的启蒙：他的《野草》写梦，写得很美，很难说它针对现实生活中的某种具体事物，它是反映在这样一种文化撞击过程中的心灵感受，而这种感受是通过美的形象表现出来的，这种美感，再过多少个世代，人们仍能体验到，人们永远能从《野草》里感受到震撼心灵的东西。如果说启蒙的话，我认为这才是文学的启蒙。但在这一点上，鲁迅是孤立的，他的传统没能延续下来，其后出现了“文学为人生”、“为无产阶级大众的文学”……一步步把文学彻底地纳入政治斗争轨道。在一定的历史条件下，这些都可以视为历史的需要、革命斗争的需要，但这不是文学，它与文学本身是抵牾的。这就是艺术和非艺术的关系。
    　　　　读者选择文学，文学也选择读者
    雷：陈思和的这个观点我同意，读者选择文学，文学也选择读者；没有音乐细胞的耳朵是不能欣赏音乐的。因此，有必要先训练能欣赏音乐的耳朵。但是，我认为也不能完全忽略了文学所处的现实环境（包括面对的读者的状况）而悬挂起一个静止的审美标准，来以此确定什么是够得上文学的，什么是够不上的。我认为什么是艺术，什么是非艺术，在每个国家每个历史时期的标准是不一样的，它应该是个动态的概念。
    文学也应该是分层次的，品位有高有低，却都可以纳入到文学的范畴里，当然这里也要有质的界限。当代中国文学的标准是什么？这是个发展变化着的东西，衡量它的时候不能从一个虚悬的文学定义出发，而应从动态的角度观察，有时也要随着社会的变化而扩大对什么是艺术的界定。
    高：我也认为不能把文学的概念定得太狭义了。文学不过是艺术的一种，艺术在我看来不过是人类情感的表现性形式。这种表现性形式因其所用材料不同而分成各种门类：用泥巴、铜皮、石料表现的就是雕塑，用建筑材料表现的就是建筑，用色彩表现的就是绘画……具体到文学来说，就是语言的艺术。那么我们再回到艺术的大概念来讲，建筑一幢房子算不算艺术？房子是住人的，但它如果砌起一个檐，挑起一个角，这就是艺术了；再说工艺美术，一只杯子设计制造得很漂亮，它也就有了艺术性。劳生柏在墙上挂几块布，在桌边堆几样东西，它也就成了艺术，因为这些表达了他的情感。苏东坡的散文、泰戈尔的小诗，里面有哲学，也有审美，我们该把它算作什么？如果把文学的概念定得太狭隘，在现实的讨论中就难免自相矛盾。
    雷：这两年，文学界比较热门的话题一是回归文学本体，排除非文学的因素问题；一是世界文学一体化，即中国文学走向世界的问题。在这两种意识之下，也确实出现了一批在艺术形式上有新意的作品，但我仍感到一种力度的欠缺。具体来说，就是在目前商品经济大潮来临、社会发生深刻转变的时刻，文学有种失重感。当然，小说创作应对现实的变化有个审美沉淀时期，我的感觉是作家对文学本体的回归、中国文学走向世界比较关注，而对干预现实中人的灵魂比较疏淡。也许这里面还有一个整个作家队伍的文化素质、文化积累比较薄弱的问题。
    王：如果谈作家的使命感、谈作家对现实的关注，我认为有些前提要先搞清楚。
    比如，在呼吁作家要有使命感、要对社会进行启蒙的时候，也要充分考虑如何实现，否则，光喊口号，意义不大。有的作家提出要注意我们文学界的生存状态，也就是我们的现实处境。这些年文学界提出的各种旗号非常多，在它们背后的，始终有这个“生存状态”问题。那些理论、口号都回避这个基本问题，而对这个基本问题，我们是无能为力的。像主张非理性，提倡淡化时代，或声明对社会问题不感兴趣，这背后都有一个共同的原因。“淡化时代”，这本身是对时代的一种理解，说对政治不感兴趣，这本身也是一种政治态度。我们可以说这些都是空话，但为什么有人还要说这个话？提出这些问题本身就带有强烈的社会性甚至政治性。如果我们对这个基本的生存状态不能碰，就会出现另一种状况。在１９７９年、１９８０年，许多最新的思想曾是作家首先提出的，而今随着思想解放程度的扩大，已使很多更根本或更尖锐的问题无法在作品中说出来，也就是说，并不是作家麻木，而是他无法表现。如果我们老是思考一个问题而得不到结果，我们就会下意识地不去思考这个问题。我们钳制自己思维的时间越长，我们在这方面思维的敏感度就会退化，以至由想到的说不出，到最后干脆不想了。有些人标榜超脱，我们可以由他们的原始出发点去判断他们的真实情况。当然，他们也会由此走向异化，但这并不奇怪。
