Japanese Prime Minister Takeshita Visits the United States

    The People's Daily reports: Japanese Prime Minister Takeshita Noboru departed from Tokyo's Haneda Airport on the evening of the 31st aboard a Japan Airlines special flight en route to the United States. This is Prime Minister Takeshita's first overseas trip of the year, and he will be the first foreign head of state to officially meet with President Bush after his inauguration.

    According to Japanese government officials, the main topics for discussion during this summit between the Japanese and American leaders will include bilateral relations, the international situation with a focus on perceptions of the Soviet Union, and preliminary consultations for the upcoming summit of Western leaders in Paris in July. Tokyo's media believes that the primary goal of Prime Minister Takeshita's visit is to establish a personal trust relationship with Bush.

    It is reported that during his stay in the United States, Prime Minister Takeshita will visit New York, Washington, and Los Angeles. In addition to holding a summit meeting with Bush, Takeshita will also hold talks with UN Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar at the United Nations headquarters and meet with former U.S. President Reagan.

    Accompanying Prime Minister Takeshita on his visit are Japanese Foreign Minister Uno Sōsuke and others. The visit is scheduled to conclude on February 7.
