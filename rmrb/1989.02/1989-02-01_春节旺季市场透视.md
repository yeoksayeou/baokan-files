After experiencing several major panic buying incidents in 1988, people are concerned: will there be new fluctuations in the Spring Festival market this year?

This concern is not unfounded. The market pressure caused by panic buying has become quite clear to us. The Spring Festival, which occurs once a year, is the most bustling time for the retail market. Stabilizing the Spring Festival market and curbing price increases are crucial for the overall economic adjustment.

Now, with only a few days left until the Spring Festival, urban and rural residents are busy preparing for the New Year. Reports from various places indicate that, thanks to efforts from all levels, the market situation this Spring Festival is better than expected and will not experience significant fluctuations.

	The key is to stabilize the "basket of vegetables"

Currently, the consumption of Chinese people is mainly focused on food, clothing, and daily necessities, with food accounting for a significant portion. Stabilizing the "basket of vegetables" can stabilize public sentiment. This point has been recognized by most government leaders.

Various levels of government have paid high attention to the supply of subsidiary foodstuffs for this Spring Festival. Mayors of large and medium-sized cities have focused their main efforts on securing the "basket of vegetables." Relevant departments acted early and swiftly to ensure a plentiful supply of subsidiary foodstuffs for the Spring Festival.

Last year's grain reduction was an unfavorable factor. However, the commercial, grain, and transportation departments worked together to complete the grain procurement and negotiated purchase quantities by the end of the year, which increased by 500 million tons compared to the same period last year. The timely arrival of 100 million tons of corn from Northeast China to the south has partially alleviated the feed shortage in some places, stabilizing pig farming in rural areas. At the end of autumn and the beginning of winter, 10 major producing provinces made every effort to purchase live pigs, and state-owned food companies purchased 7.45 million head in one month. Sales areas overcame the difficulties of concentrated arrivals and insufficient storage, supported the purchasing areas, and actively organized the shipment of goods. By the end of the year, the three major cities of Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai had a stockpile of 270,000 tons, more than double the same period last year, and had to rent meat storage facilities from other places. By the end of last year, the national stockpile of live pigs reached 19.92 million head, the highest since 1979. The production and procurement of poultry and eggs also progressed smoothly. The supply of major subsidiary foodstuffs such as meat and eggs for urban rationing during the Spring Festival is sufficient and will not be a problem.

This Spring Festival, the supply of vegetables in most regions is better than last year. The amount of vegetables transported from the south to the north alone is 22,000 carloads, totaling 610 million kilograms.

During the festival, many cities implemented retail price controls on major vegetable varieties. Due to the leading role of state-owned commerce in stabilizing vegetable prices, the prices of meat and vegetables in most farmers' markets did not experience a sharp increase. In addition to sufficient quantities and diverse varieties, stable prices have become a notable feature of this Spring Festival's vegetable supply.

	Measures to increase effective supply

Compared to food, the supply-demand contradiction for clothing and daily necessities seems more pronounced. Due to shortages of raw materials and funds, the production of daily industrial goods in the fourth quarter of last year decreased, while market demand was very strong, making the supply-demand gap more apparent. According to statistics from the Ministry of Commerce in November last year, out of 36 major daily industrial goods, 28 had lower inventories compared to the same period last year.

The fundamental solution to the shortage of daily industrial goods and durable consumer goods lies in developing production and increasing effective supply. However, there is still potential in the circulation channels. Many places have taken various measures to arrange the festival market, fully tap into resources, increase supply, and ease the supply-demand contradiction for daily industrial goods.

Tianjin City decided to coordinate the production and supply of 19 daily industrial goods with the municipal government. During the Spring Festival, it is planned to release daily industrial goods worth 800 million yuan, a 15% increase compared to the same period last year; out of 32 major industrial goods, 29 have increased compared to last year; in January this year, the commercial department organized the procurement of washing machines, refrigerators, and clothing, silk, furniture, etc., all of which increased by more than 30%, and the supply of color TVs also increased. The commercial department of Liaoning Province established a regular reporting system for essential goods and actively coordinated with relevant departments to implement the production increase plan for 38 light industrial goods, with the total value of festival goods increasing by 19.9% compared to the same period last year.

Insufficient funds for procurement are one of the reasons for the reduction in commercial inventories in some places. Commercial departments in Changchun, Tangshan, and other places have adopted measures such as discount sales to turn "dead stock" into cash, solving the problem of insufficient funds for procurement, making the quantity and variety of inventories more reasonable, and allowing the public to purchase daily necessities in a timely manner.

	Unfavorable factors that cannot be ignored

Arranging this year's Spring Festival market is not easy. Although the current situation is gratifying, we can only be cautiously optimistic. The potential instability in the market still exists, and we must not be complacent.

The overall market situation this year is tight, and the shortage of goods will not be quickly resolved. The state's financial and monetary tightening, the lack of funds for commercial departments to purchase goods, and the inability to increase inventories, as well as the tension in energy and raw materials, will naturally have an adverse impact on the production and supply of festival foodstuffs.

The phenomenon of not seeing color TVs and refrigerators on the shelves but having a large accumulation in the warehouses is not an isolated case for individual goods or individual places. Due to the hoarding by some departments, an artificial shortage of goods has been created. If similar problems are not corrected in time, they will inevitably increase the pressure on the Spring Festival market.

It is particularly worth noting that at the end of the year and the beginning of the year, the price increase trend in some places has not eased, and if not controlled, it is easy to trigger market fluctuations.

For example, in some places, the grain department does not supply subsidized rice but only sells it at a negotiated price, and there are restrictions on the amount of grain residents can purchase, leading to public misunderstanding that grain prices will rise, causing a general increase in market grain prices.

During the Spring Festival, market prices must be well-managed, especially controlling the prices of grain, oil, meat, sugar, vegetables, salt, and cloth, which are essential for people's livelihood. Price increases must not be allowed to occur arbitrarily, stabilizing public sentiment and eliminating panic, creating conditions for the year's price increase rate to be significantly lower than last year.

### 春节旺季市场透视

　　春节旺季市场透视
    本报记者  王锦鹄
    经历了１９８８年几次大的抢购风潮后，人们担心，今年春节旺季市场是否会出现新的波动？
    有此疑虑，并非杞人忧天。抢购风潮造成的巨大市场压力，我们到现在已看得比较清楚。一年一度的春节，正是零售市场需求最旺盛的时节。稳定春节市场，抑制物价上涨，这对调整中的经济全局来说，不能不是一个重要的关口。
    现在，离春节只有几天了，城乡人民群众正忙着备置年货。各地反映的情况表明，经过上上下下的努力，今年春节市场形势比预想的要好，不会出现大的波动。
    　　　　关键是稳住“菜篮子”
    时下中国人的消费，主要集中在吃穿用上，而吃又占有相当大的比重。稳住“菜篮子”，能够稳定人心。这一点，已被多数政府领导人所认识。
    对今年春节副食品供应，各级政府予以了高度重视。大中城市的市长们，都把主要精力放到了抓“菜篮子”上。有关部门动手早，行动快，为保证春节千千万万个“菜篮子”丰盛打好基础。
    去年粮食减产，是个不利的因素。但商业、粮食、储运等部门通力合作，到年底完成粮食定购、议购数量比上年同期增加５００万吨，东北百万吨玉米及时进关南下，部分缓解了一些地方的饲料紧缺，稳定了农村养猪。秋末冬初，１０个主产省尽力收购生猪，国营食品公司一个月就收购７４５万头。销区克服到货集中、库容不足的困难，支持产区收购，积极组织调入。京、津、沪三大市年底库存达２７万吨，比上年同期增长一倍多，不得不租用外地肉库储备。到去年末，全国库存生猪１９９２万头，是１９７９年以来最高的一年。禽、蛋的生产和收购，也进展顺利。春节城市定量供应的肉、蛋等主要副食品货源充足，供应已不成问题。
    今年春节大部分地区的蔬菜供应好于去年。仅南菜北运的数量就有２．２万个车皮，６．１亿公斤。
    节日期间，许多城市对主要蔬菜品种实行零售限价。由于国营商业在平抑菜价中发挥了主导作用，多数农贸市场上的肉食、蔬菜价格也未出现暴涨。除了数量足、品种多外，价格平稳已成为今年春节蔬菜供应的一个显著特点。
    　　　　采取措施增加有效供给
    比起吃的来，穿的用的商品供需矛盾似更为突出。由于原料、资金紧张，去年第４季度日用工业品生产有所下降，而市场需求十分旺盛，使供不应求更显突出。商业部去年１１月统计的３６种主要日用工业品中，有２８种库存比上年同期下降。
    解决日用工业品和耐用消费品不足，根本出路在于发展生产，增加有效供给，但流通渠道也不是没有潜力可挖。许多地方为安排好节日市场，充分挖掘货源，采取多种措施增加供应，缓解了日用工业品供需之间的矛盾。
    天津市决定１９种日用工业品为市政府协调生产和供应的商品。春节期间计划投放日用工业品货源总值８亿元，比去年同期增长１５％；３２种主要工业品中有２９种比去年增加；今年１月份商业部门组织收购的洗衣机、电冰箱和服装、丝绸、家具等都增长３０％以上，彩电供应也有所增加。辽宁省商业部门对必保商品建立了定期报告制度，并积极配合有关部门落实３８种轻工商品的增产计划，组织的节日商品总额比去年同期增长１９．９％。
    进货缺少资金，是一些地方商业库存减少的原因之一。长春、唐山等地商业部门采取让利销售等措施，变“死货”为活钱，解决了进货资金短缺的问题，使库存数量、品种趋于合理，也使群众能及时买到生活用品。
    　　　　不可忽视的不利因素
    安排好今年的春节市场不容易，现在的情况尽管使人欣喜，但我们只能表示审慎的乐观。市场潜在的不稳定因素依然存在，切不能稍有懈怠。
    今年市场总的形势偏紧，商品紧缺状况不会很快得到改变。国家财政金融紧缩，商业部门进货缺乏资金，难以增加商品库存，而能源、原材料紧张，对节日副食品生产和供应自然会产生不利影响。
    柜台上见不到彩电、冰箱，仓库里却大量积压，这不是个别商品、个别地方出现的情况。由于一些部门惜售，人为地造成了货源紧缺。今年春节市场有些地方不安排彩电投放，并非未组织到货源，而是等着涨价。类似问题如不及时纠正，势必给春节市场增加更大的压力。
    特别需要指出的是，岁末年初，一些地方物价涨势仍无缓解，如不加以控制，极易引发市场波动。
    譬如，有的地方粮食部门不供应平价大米，只卖议价，有的对居民购粮作限量规定，引起群众误解，以为粮食要涨价，诱发集市粮价普遍上涨。
    春节期间市场物价一定要管好，特别是控制住粮、油、肉、糖、菜、盐、布等群众生活必需品的价格，不允许随意乱涨价，安定民心，消除恐慌心理，为今年物价上涨幅度明显低于去年创造条件。
