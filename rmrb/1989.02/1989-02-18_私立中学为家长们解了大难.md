In recent years, many of our primary school graduates have dropped out of school because they couldn't advance to middle school. This not only makes it difficult to achieve universal primary education but also causes great difficulties for us parents.

In the second half of 1987, with the support of relevant departments, a young man named Hu Zeming, who is disabled, obtained approval from the Su County Education Commission in our province to establish a private middle school. In July 1988, Hu Zeming raised 130,000 yuan to build seven single-story houses, hired seven teachers, and enrolled 172 students.

The students enrolled in this school generally have poorer academic performance. Hu Zeming has been working hard to find teaching methods suitable for private schools, repeatedly exploring and writing lesson plans, and focusing on cultivating talents for the development of rural economies. Since the autumn semester of 1988, students have been studying diligently, and teachers have been teaching patiently. In the two county-wide examinations, the students' scores have reached or approached the level of public middle schools. Some subjects even outperformed other similar schools, earning praise from relevant departments and greatly easing the burden on us parents.

　　私立中学为家长们解了大难
    近年来，我们这里许多小学毕业生因升不了初中而辍学，这样既难以普及初等教育，又难为了我们家长。
    １９８７年下半年，一位名叫胡则明的残疾青年在有关部门的支持下，报经我省宿松县教委批准，办起了一所私立初级中学。１９８８年７月，胡则明自筹资金１．３万多元，盖了７间平房，聘请了７位教师，共招收了１７２名学生。
    这所学校招收的学生大都学习成绩较差，胡则明努力寻找符合私立学校特点的办学方法，反复探索，编写教案，注重培养发展农村经济的人才。１９８８年秋开学以来，学生用心学，教师耐心教，在全县两次统考中，学生的成绩已达到和接近公立中学的水平，有些科目成绩优于其他同类学校，得到了有关部门的好评，也为我们家长解了大难。
