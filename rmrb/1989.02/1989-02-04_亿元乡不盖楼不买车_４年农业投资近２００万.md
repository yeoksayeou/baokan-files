The Weiyang Palace Township in our district is a billion-yuan township. This township, despite having money, does not build office buildings or buy cars. Instead, it invests in agricultural production. In 1988, while the summer grain harvest in Xi'an City decreased, Weiyang Palace Township saw increases in both the summer and autumn harvests.

In recent years, the economy of Weiyang Palace Township has developed rapidly. However, the township government still uses a simple building constructed in 1974. The township government leaders have calculated that building a better office building would cost 12 million yuan, leaving no money for investment in agriculture and township enterprises. To meet the needs of development, they spent over 200,000 yuan to divide the original meeting room into 18 offices and converted half of the dining hall into a meeting room.

Since 1985, this township has invested nearly 20 million yuan in agriculture. They have constructed 31,000 meters of irrigation canals, drilled 105 wells, repaired 22 old wells, built and renovated 4 pumping stations, updated 15,000 meters of electrical wiring, and built 33 kilometers of roads. Both the village and township levels have established service systems for agricultural technology, machinery, water and electricity, livestock, seeds, and pesticides.

　　亿元乡不盖楼不买车
　  ４年农业投资近２００万
    我区未央宫乡是个亿元乡，这个乡有钱不盖办公楼，不买小轿车，把钱用在发展农业生产上。１９８８年，西安市夏粮减产，未央宫乡却夏、秋两季增产。
    近几年，未央宫乡经济发展较快。但乡政府用的还是１９７４年建造的简易房。乡政府领导同志算过一笔帐：建一座好一点的办公楼，得耗资１２０万元，这样就没有钱给农业和乡镇企业投资了。为适应发展的需要，他们用２万多元，把原会议室隔成１８间办公室，又把食堂分一半改建成会议室。
    １９８５年以来，这个乡农业投资近２００万元，修了３．１万米长的水渠，打成１０５眼机井、修复２２眼旧井，新建改建４个抽水站，更新电线１．５万米，修路３３公里。村乡两级全都建起了农技、农机、水电、畜牧、种子、农药等服务体系。
