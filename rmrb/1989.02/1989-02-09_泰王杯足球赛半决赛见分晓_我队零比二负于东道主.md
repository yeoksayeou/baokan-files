The results of the semi-finals of the 20th King's Cup football tournament were decided tonight. The Chinese team lost 0-2 to the host team, Thailand A, and failed to advance to the finals. The Soviet Union team won 1-0 against South Korea, and will enter the finals with Thailand A.

The match between the Chinese team and Thailand A attracted nearly 60,000 spectators. Thailand A is known for its speed and counter-attacking abilities. The Chinese team was overly cautious and made several passing errors, allowing Thailand to maintain the initiative throughout the game.

In the 40th minute of the first half, Thailand launched an attack from the left side, creating a 2-vs-1 situation against the Chinese goal. Player number 14 received a pass and easily scored, making it 1-0. In the second half, the Chinese team played more actively and created several scoring opportunities. However, in the 30th minute of the second half, due to a passing error by the Chinese team, Thailand's number 13 scored another goal. Local sports officials believe that the main reason for the Chinese team's loss is their inability to adapt to Thailand's fast counter-attacks, failing to play to their full potential.

　　泰王杯足球赛半决赛见分晓
　　我队零比二负于东道主
    新华社曼谷２月８日电  （记者黄勇）第二十届泰王杯足球赛今晚进行半决赛。中国队以０∶２负于泰国Ａ队，未能进入决赛。苏联队以１∶０胜南朝鲜队，同泰国Ａ队进入决赛。
    中国队对泰国Ａ队的比赛吸引了近六万名观众。泰国Ａ队特点是速度快，善于打反击。中国队思想未放开，打得十分拘谨，加上传球失误较多，泰国队一直处于主动地位。
    上半时进行到４０分钟时，泰国队从左路进攻，并形成二打一直逼中国队大门形势，１４号接过队友传球，轻轻踢入网内，以１∶０领先。下半场中国队打得比较积极，多次给对方大门造成威胁。但下半场进行到３０分钟时，中国队由于传球失误，泰国队由１３号又攻入一球。此间体育界人士认为，中国队失利的主要原因是不适应泰国队的快速反击，未能发挥出自己的水平。
