Since the late 1970s, a new industrial revolution characterized by the development of high technology and the establishment of high-tech industries has rapidly developed. The history of world science and technology has thus entered a new stage, the era of high technology. Over the past decade, due to the imbalance in the economic and technological development of various countries, the international political landscape has undergone tremendous changes. In the next decade leading up to the turn of the century, a new generation of high technologies will increasingly become practical and industrialized, bringing unprecedented widespread innovations in energy, materials, information, agriculture, transportation, and other fields. Their impact on economic growth will be much greater than that of the current generation of high technologies. The world may welcome the arrival of the new century with greater economic leaps.

Three major technologies are the main battlegrounds for competition; the strength of the four major powers is moving towards balance

By the beginning of the next century, significant breakthroughs may occur in information technology, biotechnology, and new materials technology, which are generally referred to as the three major technologies of the 21st century. They are the main battlegrounds for competition among technologically advanced countries.

Information technology will continue to play a leading role in the entire field of science and technology. Japan successfully developed the fifth-generation computer last year. Computers with speeds of up to one trillion operations per second, using lasers, biological, and superconducting technologies, are expected to be manufactured by the year 2000. The development of ultra-high-speed computers will create conditions for the development of biological computers. It is estimated that by 2015, the basic principles of the so-called sixth-generation computer can be solved. Optoelectronic technology will develop even faster, with a market size of $200 billion expected in 10 years.

Biotechnology is the core of future science and technology. This emerging technology has great potential in solving problems related to food, energy, the environment, health, and other human interests. According to U.S. predictions, by the year 2000, five-sixths of the annual increase in global agricultural production will come from biotechnology and other yield-increasing measures, with only one-sixth coming from an increase in cultivated land area. By the year 2000, the biotechnology industry is expected to generate annual economic benefits of over $100 billion.

New materials will form the foundation of future science and technology. High-temperature superconducting materials will be widely used by the beginning of the next century, fundamentally transforming power generation, power supply, transportation, and information technology, with an impact on the economy that may surpass that of the telephone and the transistor. Ceramic materials will widely replace metals. Engines made from these materials are energy-efficient and durable, capable of continuous operation for more than a decade without maintenance, and can be popularized by the year 2000.

In addition to the three major technologies, aerospace technology will continue to play a role in driving the overall development of science and technology. Currently, aerospace technology has entered the stage of practical application and commercialization, with the near-term goal of utilizing space stations to develop space metallurgy, space biotechnology, space medicine, satellites, solar power generation, and space tourism. It is estimated that by the year 2000, a $65 billion industry will be formed. The long-term development goal is to explore the planets of the solar system, establish outposts on the moon, and land on Mars.

By the end of this century, the main battlegrounds of world science and technology will continue to be controlled by the United States, Japan, Western Europe, and the Soviet Union, with the United States still in the lead. This is due to the following reasons: first, the United States has the most advanced scientific research facilities, equipment, and substantial research funds (currently, U.S. research funding exceeds that of Japan, West Germany, the UK, and France combined); second, the United States has a large number of outstanding scientists and engineers; third, the United States recognizes that strengthening science and technology is the fundamental way to enhance U.S. economic competitiveness and maintain its status as a superpower.

However, it must be noted that the United States' competitors may develop more rapidly. The United States estimates that the overall level of Soviet science and technology lags behind the West by 10-12 years. But with the development of Soviet reforms and the appropriate adjustment of the policy of one-sidedly developing military technology, coupled with its ability to mobilize its vast scientific research forces and use the method of direct national organization to concentrate on breakthroughs, it is possible that in a relatively short period, it will achieve rapid development in some fields. Western European science and technology have achieved remarkable results through cooperation. The establishment of the unified market in 1992 will further promote the development of this cooperation in depth and breadth. Japanese science and technology will continue to develop at a relatively fast pace, and it has decided to take over the traditional advantages held by the United States in many fields by the end of this century. However, Japan's scientific and technological position may also relatively decline. This is because Japanese science and technology have entered the "innovative" stage, with relatively weak basic research, and the difficulties it will encounter will far exceed the previous "imitation" and "catch-up" stages.

The gap between North and South in science and technology will further widen; some developing countries have made progress

For the vast majority of developing countries, scientific and technological progress is more of a challenge than an opportunity. The further development of science and technology has reduced the demand of economically advanced countries for raw materials and cheap labor, exacerbating the difficulties of accumulating scientific research funds for developing countries. Some developing countries have backward infrastructure and low cultural levels among workers, making them unattractive to transnational corporations that can provide funding and technology sources.

Developing countries account for 75% of the world's population, but scientists account for only 6%, and most of them are concentrated in a few countries in East Asia, South Asia, and Latin America. Some high-level talents are constantly flowing out. These countries have a low starting point for science and technology, weak foundations, and some high technologies have not even been put on the agenda, while others have not yet sorted out the relationship between high technology and general technology and traditional industries. Therefore, most developing countries will further widen the gap with developed countries.

A few developing countries and regions have made significant progress in science and technology. China, India, South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, Brazil, Mexico, and Israel have all made developing high technology a major decision. For example, India has nearly 3 million scientists and engineers, ranking third in the world in terms of quantity, and has established a complete set of research facilities. It ranks second in Asia in nuclear energy and nuclear medicine, and it can already develop the technology to convert thorium into uranium-233. South Korea has formulated a technological development plan for the year 2000, with the goal of raising South Korea's science and technology to an internationally advanced level. Its research funding has reached 2% of GDP, and it will increase to 3% in 1991 (exceeding the current levels of the U.S. and Japan), and to 5% by the year 2000. In just a few years, it has become the world's third-largest semiconductor manufacturer, with annual exports exceeding $10 billion, emerging as a major threat to the U.S. and Japan.

The role of military research is declining; the role of civilian research is increasing

Many countries have traditionally relied on military research to drive civilian research, using the results of military research to develop civilian technologies. In the era of high technology, this experience is no longer fully applicable. The law of high technology development is to use the most advanced technology as the mother body, expanding it into a series of high-tech groups, continuously forming various industries. In the process of developing new industries, high technology is continuously maturing, brewing new technologies, thus proposing new investment requirements and opening up new markets. Military products cannot establish a faster, more direct, and broader connection with the market like civilian products, and military research cannot achieve more and faster economic benefits compared to civilian research. At the same time, military research has a high starting point, high investment, and a long cycle, affecting the cost-effectiveness ratio. Military research, due to its emphasis on secrecy, makes it difficult to monitor its progress and results, and it is easy to pursue product performance one-sidedly, not calculating the cost, and encouraging enterprises to rely on market protection to sell their products. In addition, military technology is becoming increasingly specialized, coupled with strict secrecy requirements, making the transfer and application increasingly complex.

Some technologically advanced countries allocate a significant portion of their research funding to military research, with the U.S. at nearly 70%, the UK at nearly 50%, and the Soviet Union not publishing relevant data, which is certainly not below the U.S. Of course, this is due to the international environment, the strategic position of each country, and their strategic thinking, but this emphasis on military research is somewhat detrimental to the development of science and technology and the enhancement of economic competitiveness. According to statistics, the military research sector can only drive 6 people to engage in production per person, while the civilian research sector can drive 35 people per person. This year, the U.S. SDI budget will be reduced by 40%, while the "Eureka" plan, which aims to develop civilian high technologies, is rapidly developing. In the future, as military confrontations and regional conflicts gradually ease and economic competition becomes more important, major powers will inevitably reduce their investment in military research.

The cycle from scientific discovery to technological development is shortening; the time from technological innovation to commercialization is accelerating

The cycle between scientific discovery and technological invention is becoming shorter. From Faraday's discovery of the law of electromagnetic induction in 1831 to the manufacture of the generator in 1881, it took 51 years. From Einstein's proposal of the mass-energy relationship E=MC^2 in 1905 to the first atomic bomb explosion, it took 40 years. From Watson and Crick's discovery of DNA in 1953 to the development of biotechnology, it took 20 years. In 1957, Esaki discovered the principle of semiconductors, and semiconductor diodes were already on the market six years later. Currently, the scientific factors contained in high-tech inventions are much more concentrated than before, increasingly relying on basic research. For example, semiconductor researchers no longer consider solid-state material problems but molecular chains, and they must understand deeper theoretical chemistry, making the relationship between technological development and basic research even closer. Therefore, British science analyst John Owen emphasized, "Science is becoming technology."

The cycle from scientific and technological achievements to commercialization and economic benefits is also shortening. Surveys show that this cycle was about 100 years in the 18th century, 50 years in the 19th century, 30 years before World War I, 16 years between the two world wars, 7 years after World War II, and currently, some developed countries update products in just 5 to 8 years, or even 2 to 3 years.

The result of the above trends in scientific and technological development is that the cycle between technological innovation and the economic leap it brings is also shortening. According to Toffler's analysis in "The Third Wave," the waves of technological revolution and economic prosperity almost rise in sync during the period of high-tech development. In the future, the leap in science and technology will certainly bring greater economic development.

This trend will continue to develop. The fundamental reason is that science and technology are increasingly integrated with the economy, and the focus of developing science and technology is to enhance economic competitiveness. The battlefield of technological competition is not in the laboratory but in the market. Large-scale commercialization is the ultimate criterion for determining the outcome of scientific and technological competition. Modern scientists and engineers must be more conscious of economic awareness and opportunity awareness.

Preparing for the scientific and technological competition of the next century; emphasizing basic scientific research, education, and talent

Existing basic scientific research results, after years of development and application, can no longer play a greater role and need to be explored in new ways. For example, to significantly increase the speed of computers, it is necessary to develop non-electronic devices, leading to the theoretical research of lasers and biological chips. Basic scientific research usually takes 10 years or even several decades to achieve results. The success of the industrial technological revolution of the 21st century will depend on occupying the "high ground" of basic scientific research today.

The scientific and technological competitiveness of the future to a large extent depends on the current state of education. In recent years, many developed countries have seen a surge in "education fever," increasing educational investment on the one hand, and more importantly, exploring ways to reform education to meet the needs of high-tech development. Due to the shortening of the update cycle of high technologies, the knowledge learned in school will become outdated in about 10 years. At the same time, new technologies, new materials, and new procedures are constantly emerging, coupled with frequent adjustments to the industrial structure, making lifelong education of unprecedented importance. Japan has made "lifelong education" an important topic in educational reform. Many countries also emphasize cross-disciplinary education, advocating that education should highlight individuality and cultivate innovative consciousness.

In the competition of high technologies, talent plays a more important role than ever. For a long time, the competition for talent has mainly been between the United States and other countries, although this trend will not fundamentally change in the near future, but the following new trends may emerge: first, Japan's competition for talent will become more active. In the past, Japan mainly used the method of "sending out" (mainly to the United States) to absorb advanced technology, but in the future, it will both "send out" (increasing the number of people sent to Western Europe) and "invite in," attracting foreign scientists, while also continuously utilizing overseas intellectual resources on the spot. Japan's focus on competing for talent is its weak link in basic scientific research. Second, other countries and regions will vigorously prevent the outflow of talent and try to bring back those who have left. Western Europe, India, Taiwan, and South Korea have already taken some effective measures, and these efforts will be further strengthened in the future.

International scientific and technological cooperation is becoming a basic characteristic of modern science and technology. The more science develops, the greater the obstacles, and the need for countries to work together to overcome them. Some major scientific research projects and engineering investments are enormous, and one country cannot bear the burden. Basic scientific research in cutting-edge fields, in particular, requires scientists from different schools and cultural backgrounds to exchange ideas and collaborate. Currently, the world is facing serious problems such as ecological deterioration, resource depletion, population explosion, and food shortages, and "saving the Earth" has become a consensus among countries, requiring mutual cooperation. Western European countries have successfully carried out multi-level, multi-channel, and multi-form scientific and technological cooperation between enterprises, governments, and between governments and enterprises. The trend of "regionalization" of economic cooperation is also emerging in other regions. As a supporting force, scientific and technological cooperation will develop with the deepening of economic interdependence among countries; scientific and technological cooperation will play an increasingly important role in strengthening international relations.

Of course, international scientific and technological cooperation requires strength and mutual benefit. Therefore, important cooperation is mainly carried out between technologically advanced countries, and it is not easy to develop between the North and the South. Even cooperation within the West is full of restrictions and counter-restrictions, and cooperation between the East and the West can only be limited to non-sensitive fields and the exploratory stage of basic scientific research. However, in any case, the idea of establishing an independent and complete scientific and technological system for a single country is no longer in line with the trend of the times.

Using high technology to develop military technology; military equipment is becoming fewer but more precise and smaller

The development of military technology characterized by the application of high technology will have two trends worth noting in the future: first, the U.S. and the Soviet Union, in order to maintain nuclear balance, will pay special attention to the development of beam weapons. In the long run, the source of destruction will no longer be explosives and steel. Second, in the short term, it is more obvious that various countries will strive to fully apply high technology to conventional weapons, significantly improving their accuracy, range, and power, achieving the same combat effectiveness as nuclear weapons, enhancing the deterrent power of conventional forces, and reducing dependence on nuclear weapons. This is conducive to the implementation of flexible strategic policies. High-precision weapons (1-3 meters) can destroy various point or area targets with one or a few shots; "smart weapons" can identify and select targets while tracking them; "stealth" technology greatly enhances the protection and penetration capabilities of aircraft, making the enemy's large-scale investment in air defense ineffective; operating tanks with robots is no longer a fantasy. Weapons will be fewer but more precise, and troops will be smaller. Military technology both escalates the arms race and provides conditions for disarmament, including the reduction of conventional weapons.

　　走向２０００年的世界科技
    国际技术经济研究所  杨景厚
    ７０年代末以来，以开发高科技和建立高科技产业为特征的新的产业革命迅猛发展，世界科技发展史随之进入了一个崭新的阶段，即高科技时代。１０余年来，由于各国经济、技术发展的不平衡，国际关系格局出现了巨大的变动。在距世纪之交的另一个１０余年里，新的一代高科技将日趋达到实用化、产业化，并将给能源、材料、信息、农业、交通运输等方面带来空前广泛的革新，它们对经济增长的作用将比现在这一代高科技大得多。世界有可能以更大的经济飞跃迎接新的世纪的到来。
    　　　　三大技术是竞争主要战场　四强实力向平衡方向发展
    到下一世纪初，可能出现重大突破并对经济增长产生重大影响的是信息、生物工程和新材料技术，人们一般统称之为２１世纪三大技术，它们是技术强国竞争的主战场。
    信息技术对整个科技将继续发挥前导作用。日本已在去年研制成功第５代计算机。速度可达每秒１万亿次的激光、生物、超导计算机可望在２０００年前后制成。超高速计算机的研制将为开发生物计算机创造条件，估计到２０１５年可以解决这种被称为第６代计算机的基本原理。光电子技术将有更快的发展，１０年后市场规模可达２０００亿美元。
    生物工程是未来科技的核心。这个新兴科技对于解决粮食、能源、环境、健康等许多人类切身利益问题具有极大的潜力。据美国预测，到２０００年全世界农产品年增长量的５／６将来自生物技术和其它增产措施，只有１／６来自耕地面积增加。到２０００年生物工程产业每年经济收益可达上千亿美元。
    新材料将构成未来科技的基础。高温超导材料将在下世纪初广泛应用，使发电、供电、运输、信息发生根本变革性的发展，对经济的影响程度可能超过电话和晶体管。陶瓷材料将广泛地取代金属，用这种材料制造的汽车发动机节能而耐用，可连续工作十几年而无需维修，２０００年前可推广。
    除三大技术外，航天技术仍将起着推动科技全面发展的作用。目前，航天技术已进入实用化、商业化阶段，其近期目标是利用空间站开发空间冶炼、空间生物工程、空间医药、卫星、太阳能发电以及空间旅游等。预计到２０００年可形成年产值６５０亿美元的大产业。其长期发展目标是向太阳系行星进行探索，在月球建立前哨基地和登上火星。
    到本世纪末，世界科技主要阵地继续由美国、日本、西欧和苏联控制，美国仍居领先地位。这是由于：第一，美国拥有首屈一指的科研设施、设备以及雄厚的科研资金（现在美国科研经费超过日、西德、英、法的总和）；第二，美国有众多的优秀科技人才；第三，美国认识到加强科技是提高美国经济竞争能力、维持超级大国地位的根本途径。
    但是，还必须看到美国的竞争对手可能有更快的发展。美国估计苏联科技的总水平落后于西方１０—１２年。但随着苏联改革的开展和对片面发展军事技术方针的适当调整，加上它可以动员其庞大的科研力量，采用国家直接组织的方式集中攻坚，它有可能在不太长的时期内在一部分领域取得迅速发展。西欧科技通过联合的办法已取得有目共睹的成效。１９９２年统一市场的建立，将进一步推动这种联合在深度和广度上发展。日本科技今后仍以较快的速度发展，它已下定决心要在本世纪末在许多领域内把美国手中的传统优势夺过来。但是日本科技实力地位也有可能相对下降。这是由于日本科技发展已进入“独创”阶段，它的基础科研比较薄弱，所遇到的困难将大大超过以往“模仿”和“追赶”阶段。
    　　　　南北科技差距进一步拉大　一些发展中国家已有进展
    科技进步对于绝大多数发展中国家来说是挑战大于机会。科技的进一步发展降低了经济先进国家对原料和廉价劳动力的需求，加剧了发展中国家科研资金积累的困难。一些发展中国家基础设施落后，工人文化水平低，对于可以提供资金和技术来源的跨国公司来说，它们已失去了吸引力。
    发展中国家的人口占世界人口的７５％，但科学家却只占６％，而且大多集中在东亚、南亚和拉美少数国家，一些高水平的人才还不断外流。这些国家科技起点低，基础薄弱，有的高科技尚未提到日程，有的尚未理顺高科技与一般技术、传统产业的关系。因此，大多数发展中国家将进一步拉大同发达国家的差距。
    少数发展中国家和地区的科技已取得长足的进步。中国、印度、南朝鲜、新加坡、台湾、巴西、墨西哥、以色列等都把发展高科技作为重大决策。如印度拥有近３００万人的科技队伍，在数量上居世界第３位，并建立了门类齐全的科研设施。它在核能、核医学等方面在亚洲仅次于日本，特别是它已能开发将钍转换为铀２３３的技术。南朝鲜已制订了到２０００年的技术开发计划，其目标是把南朝鲜的科技提高到国际先进水平。它的科研经费已达到国民生产总值的２％，１９９１年将提高到３％（超过美、日现在的水平），２０００年达到５％。它在短短几年内已成为世界制造半导体的第３大国，年出口额已超过１００亿美元，异军突起，使美、日感受到巨大的威胁。
    　　　　军事科研作用下降　民用科研作用增强
    许多国家一向以军事科研带动民用科研，利用军事科研的成果来开发民用技术。在高科技时代，这个经验已不完全适用。高科技发展的规律是以最尖端的科技为母体，扩展为一系列高科技群，不断形成各种产业。在新产业的发展过程中高科技不断成熟化，酝酿更新的技术，由此提出新的投资要求，开拓新的市场。军品不可能像民品那样同市场建立更快、更直接、更广泛的联系，与民用科研相比军事科研不能取得更多更快的经济效益。同时军事科研起点高，投资多，周期长，影响效费比。军事科研由于强调保密，其进展与结果不易受到监督，并且容易片面追求产品性能，不计成本，助长企业依赖市场保护推销其产品。此外军事技术愈来愈专门化，加上保密的严格要求，转移应用日趋复杂。
    一些科技大国在科研经费分配中，军事科研一直占相当大的比例，美国近７０％，英国近５０％，苏联未发表过有关数据，当不在美国之下。当然这是由于一定的国际环境、各国所处战略地位和它们的战略思想所决定的，但这种偏重军事科研的做法对于科技的发展和经济竞争能力的提高有相当不利的影响。据统计，现在军事科研部门每人只能带动６人进行生产，而民用科研部门每人可带动３５人。今年美国ＳＤＩ费预算将削减４０％，以开发民用高科技为宗旨的“尤里卡”计划却在迅速发展。在今后军事对抗和地区冲突逐渐缓解和经济竞争具有更重要意义的情况下，大国对军事科研的投入必将会出现下降趋势。
　　　科学发现到技术开发周期缩短　技术创新到转为商品时间加快
    科学发现与技术发明之间的周期日益缩短。从１８３１年法拉第发现电磁感应定律到１８８１年制造发电机相隔５１年。从１９０５年爱因斯坦提出物质与能关系的Ｅ＝ＭＣ２公式到第一颗原子弹爆炸相隔４０年。从１９５３年沃森和克里克发现ＤＮＡ到开发生物技术相隔２０年。１９５７年江崎发现半导体原理，６年后半导体二极管即问世。当前高技术的发明创造所包含的科学因素比以往大为密集，日益以基础科研为依托。如半导体研制人员考虑的不再是固体材料问题，而是分子链，他们必须懂得较深的理论化学，从而使技术开发与基础科研的关系更为紧密。因此英国科学分析家约翰·欧文强调指出“科学正在成为技术”。
    科技成果转化为商品、产生经济效益的周期也在日益缩短。调查表明，这种周期在１８世纪约为１００年，１９世纪缩短为５０年，第一次世界大战前为３０年，两次世界大战之间为１６年，第二次世界大战之后缩短为７年，而目前一些发达国家更新产品一般只需５至８年，甚至２至３年。
    上述科技发展趋势的结果是由技术创新与它所带来的经济飞跃之间的周期也趋向缩短。按照托夫勒在《第三次浪潮》中的分析，技术革命浪潮和经济景气浪潮在高科技发展时期几乎是同步上升的。今后，科技的飞跃必将带来经济的更大发展。
    这种趋势今后将继续发展。其根本原因是科技日益与经济结合，发展科技的着眼点是提高经济竞争能力。技术竞争的战场不在实验室，而是市场。大规模商业化是判定科技竞争胜负的最终依据。现代科研人员必须更自觉地具备经济意识与机会意识。
    　　　　为下世纪科技竞争作准备　重视基础科研教育与人才
    现有的基础科研成果，经过多年的开发应用，已难以发挥更大的作用，需要另辟蹊径。如为了大幅度提高计算机速度，必须开发非电子器件，由此而产生了激光、生物芯片的理论研究。基础科研获得成果一般为１０年，乃至几十年。２１世纪的产业技术革命的成功要取决于今天抢占基础科研的“制高点”。
    未来科技竞争能力在很大程度上取决于现在的教育状况。近年来，许多发达国家兴起一股“教育热”，一方面增加教育投入，更重要的是深入探索教改途径，以适应高科技发展的需要。由于高科技更新换代周期的缩短，从学校学到的知识１０年左右就要老化。同时新工艺、新材料、新程序不断出现，加上产业结构的经常调整，在职教育具有空前重要的作用。日本已把“终生教育”作为教育改革的重要议题。许多国家还强调实行跨学科教育，主张教育要突出个性化，培育人的创新意识。
    在高科技竞争中，人才起着比以往更重要的作用。长期以来，人才争夺斗争主要表现为美国同其他国家之间的争夺与反争夺，虽然这一趋势在今后相当时期内不会发生根本变化，但可能出现以下新动向：第一，日本争夺人才的活动将日趋活跃。日本过去主要是用“派出去”（以美国为主）的办法吸收先进技术，今后将既“派出去”（增加派往西欧的人数），又“请进来”，吸引外国科学家，同时还不断就地利用海外智力资源。日本争夺的重点是它的薄弱环节基础科研人才。第二，其他国家和地区将大力防止人才外流，并设法把外流的召回来。西欧、印度、台湾、南朝鲜已采取了一些有效措施，今后将会进一步加强。
    　　　　需要世界各国联合攻坚　国际科技合作不断扩大
    国际科技合作已成为现代科技的基本特征之一。科学愈发展，险阻愈大，需要各国联合攻坚。一些重大科研项目和工程投资浩大，一国难以承担。属于尖端领域的基础科研尤其需要不同学派和不同文化背景的科学家互相切磋，交流思路；当前世界面临诸如生态恶化、资源逐渐枯竭、人口爆炸、粮食短缺等严重问题，“拯救地球”已成为各国的共识，需要相互协作；西欧各国已卓有成效地开展了企业之间、政府之间以及政府与企业之间的多层次、多渠道、多形式的科技合作。经济合作“地区化”（经济圈）的趋势在其他地区也正在出现。作为支撑力量之一的科技合作必将随着各国经济依存关系的发展而发展；科技合作将日益发挥加强国际关系的纽带作用。
    当然，国际科技合作一要有实力，二要互利。因此重要的合作主要是在科技强国之间进行，南北之间不大可能开展。即使西方之间的合作也充满了限制与反限制的斗争，东西方之间则只能局限于非敏感领域和探索阶段的基础科研。但无论如何，建立一国独立完整的科技体系的思想已经不合乎时代的潮流。
    　　　　运用高科技发展军事技术　军备日趋少而精与小型化
    以应用高科技为特征的军事技术的发展，今后有两个趋势值得注意：一是美苏为了维持核平衡，特别重视发展射束武器，从长远看杀伤源不再是炸药和钢铁。二是就今后一个时期来说，更明显的是各国将致力于把高科技充分运用到常规武器上面来，使其命中精度、射程、威力得到空前的提高，以收到核武器的同样作战效果，增强常规部队的威慑作用，减少对核武器的依赖，这样有利于实施灵活的战略方针。高命中精度（１—３米）的常规武器只需一或数发即可摧毁各种点或面目标；“智能武器”能在跟踪目标中对其加以辨认、选择；“潜隐”技术极大地提高飞机的防护和突破能力，使敌方对空防的大量投资归于无效；用机器人操纵坦克已经不是幻想。武器少而精、部队小型化将是各国发展军备的方向。军事技术既使军备竞赛不断升级，又为裁军，包括裁减常规军备提供了条件。（附图片）
