Marrakech is an inland ancient capital of Northwest Africa's Morocco, known for its buildings, most of which are painted a reddish-brown color. However, it is not the typical African landscape one might imagine, such as palm-leaf huts or the rusty spears of native inhabitants. The streets are filled with cars bearing French and West German Mercedes-Benz logos; the shops sell British cigarettes, French fashion, and Italian tableware; the luxurious hotels are occupied by European Community tourists with sun-tanned skin; and most people speak a somewhat unrefined French.

This is a common observation for any journalist visiting for the first time. As a smokeless industry, this is not surprising. If managed well, it is an inexhaustible source of revenue. The interdependence and complementary nature of the global economy are irreversible trends. However, the five Maghreb countries, stretching from the Egyptian border in the east to the Atlantic Ocean in the west, from the Senegal River and the northern border of Mali in the south to the European countries across the sea in the north, now face a critical question: with only three years left until the establishment of the European Single Market in 1992, "What should we do?"

A Moroccan newspaper editor frankly asked the reporter, "If the 12 European countries unite into one large bloc, how can these small North African countries resist?" The West exports goods, technology, and capital, while we provide the market, labor, and raw materials, maintaining this status quo? "They are always ahead, always benefiting. Is this fair?"

It seems that the real issue is how to handle South-North relations in today's increasingly globalized economy and how North African countries should face the 1992 challenge.

The economic situations of the Maghreb countries vary, but none are particularly prosperous. One important factor is the sharp drop in oil and oil product prices, and the sluggish market for raw materials. Before establishing their own industrial and agricultural systems, North African countries have been at a disadvantage in trading relatively low-priced primary products with Western Europe. According to reports, Morocco's trade with Europe accounts for 65% of its total foreign trade, while Algeria and Tunisia's trade with Europe accounts for 56% and 78% of their total foreign trade, respectively. After the formal establishment of the European Single Market, economic protectionism will become even more pronounced. The Maghreb countries' existing markets for agricultural products exported to Western Europe may further shrink. Additionally, a single, weak country facing economic exchanges with a 12-nation bloc not only lacks financial strength but is also at a disadvantage in debt negotiations and loan conditions. The only way out is to form a bloc to counter a bloc.

The festivities in Marrakech over the past few days have a profound background. The green-hatted, red-robed, and white-horse cavalrymen paid tribute to the heads of state of the five countries: Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, and Mauritania. This is not just because the five countries have formed the Arab Maghreb Union, realizing part of the Arab unity dream, but more importantly, because the nearly 100 million people of the Great Maghreb will now participate in global economic competition as a bloc, protecting and expanding their own interests.

Those who are somewhat familiar with the history of the Maghreb will be surprised to discover, on the joyous day of the establishment of the Maghreb group organization, as the crowd waves long-sleeved puppets in celebration, that the old grudges between the five countries are fading away. People no longer want to talk about the Western Sahara issue or revisit those past conflicts, instead yearning for rapid progress in the Great Maghreb. The editor of the magazine "Departure" even envisages how the Great Maghreb could introduce automobile production lines, how to raise funds, and how to arrange the layout. The thoughts of journalists are habitually forward-looking, while Western European journalists are more concerned about the stability of the Maghreb organization. In reality, once the Maghreb countries prioritize economic interests and economic security over current political differences, it is entirely possible to continuously improve relations through consultation.

Gazing north from Marrakech, there are no high mountains obstructing the view, just a vast plain. European Community container trucks travel south and north. Every year, 1.6 million European tourists spend approximately $1 billion in foreign currency in Morocco's rich and beautiful land. They also join the crowd to watch the signing of the Great Maghreb document. Undoubtedly, looking back from the future of the Great Maghreb and the European Community, which will be both competitive and complementary, people will have a deeper sense of meaning.

　　从马拉喀什北眺
    本报记者  林皎明
    马拉喀什是西北非摩洛哥的内陆古都，以绝大部分建筑物外表涂成褚红色为特色。但是，它绝不是通常想见的非洲景致，诸如棕榈枝扎成的草棚、土著居民锈钝的长矛，等等。街上跑的，是法国标志牌和西德奔驰牌轿车；店里卖的，是英国香烟、法国时装、意大利餐具；豪华旅馆里住的，是寻找阳光地带被晒成古铜色皮肤的欧共体旅客；多数人说的，是不太正宗的法语。
    这是任何初来乍到的记者很容易得到的直觉。作为无烟工业，这显然不足为怪。经营得好，这是一个取之不尽的财源。国际之间的经济相互依存和互补状况，是不可逆转的趋势。然而，东起埃及边界，西临大西洋，南至塞内加尔河和马里北疆，北与西欧隔海相望的马格里布５国（摩洛哥、阿尔及利亚、突尼斯、利比亚、毛里塔尼亚）现在却不得不提出这样一个问题：距离１９９２年欧洲统一大市场的成立只剩３年时间，“我们怎么办？”
    摩哥洛一位报纸主编坦率地反问记者，“欧洲１２国如果结合成一个大块头，北非的这些小国单独如何抵挡得住？”西欧出商品、出技术、出资金，我们给市场、提供劳力、输送原料，始终维持这么个局面？”“老是他们先进，老是他们得利，公平吗？”
    看来，实质问题是，在世界经济日趋集团化的今天，南北关系如何处置，北非国家如何面对１９９２年挑战。
    马格里布国家经济状况虽各有差异，但普遍不是十分景气的。其中一个重要因素，是原油及原油产品价格暴跌，原料价格市场疲软。北非各国在建立起自己的工农业体系之前，以相对低价的初级产品与西欧交易，显然是吃亏的。据报道，摩洛哥对欧贸易占外贸总额６５％，阿尔及利亚和突尼斯的对欧贸易也分别占全部外贸金额的５６％和７８％。欧洲统一大市场正式建立后，经济保护主义色彩愈加浓厚。马格里布各国原有的输往西欧的农产品市场有可能进一步失落。此外，以力单势薄的一个国家对付１２国集团的经济交往，不仅财力不足，而且在债务谈判、贷款条件等对话中更加处于不利地位。出路显然只有一条：以集团对集团。
    马拉喀什市这两天犹如盛大节日般地欢庆是有其深刻背景的。绿帽子、红礼服、白骏马的骠骑兵，向摩洛哥、阿尔及利亚、突尼斯、利比亚和毛里塔尼亚５国元首致敬。绝不再单纯是因为５国结成阿拉伯大马格里布统一组织“实现了阿拉伯统一的部分宿愿”，而更重要的原因在于，近１亿人口的大马格里布今后也将以集团身份参加世界经济竞争，保护和开拓自己的切身利益。
    稍微了解马格里布历史的人，在马拉加什集团组织成立的欢乐日子里，在挥动长袍木偶以示庆祝的队伍中，会惊诧地发现，昔日５国之间的恩仇积怨在淡化，在渐渐逝去。人们不愿再谈什么西撒问题，不想重提那些纷争往事，向往着加速进步的大马格里布。《出发》杂志总编辑甚至在设想，大马格里布如果引进汽车生产线，应该如何筹集资金，如何安排布局。新闻工作者的思想习惯性地超前，而西欧记者则比较关注大马格里布组织的稳定程度。实际上，一旦马格里布各国视经济利益和经济安全超过当前尚存的政见分歧，那末，通过协商不断改善彼此之间关系完全是可能的。
    从马拉喀什向北望去，没有高山阻挡，一马平川。欧共体的集装箱卡车南来北往。每年１６０万欧洲游客把腰包里约值１０亿美元的外币消费在摩洛哥富饶美丽的土地上。他们也挤在人群中观望庆祝大马格里布文件签署的盛况。毋庸置疑，从大马格里布与欧共体既竞争又互补的明天回头看今天，人们会有意味更深的感叹。
