China's "Jidi" scientific expedition ship, which successfully completed the construction of the Zhongshan Station in the eastern Antarctic, set sail on its return journey to the motherland at noon on the 27th (local time). Due to the approaching winter season in the Antarctic, the weather has been increasingly harsh, prompting the expedition team to withdraw earlier than planned. The originally scheduled return date was March 5th.

　　我“极地”号科学考察船返航
    胜利完成南极中山站建设的中国首次东南极考察队，二十七日中午十二时（当地时间），乘“极地”号船踏上返回祖国的归途。近来，由于南极大陆接近寒季，天气越来越恶劣，这支考察队只得提前撤离。原定返航时间为三月五日。
