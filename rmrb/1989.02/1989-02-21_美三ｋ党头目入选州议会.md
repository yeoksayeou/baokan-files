The leader of the American KKK, David Duke, last night broke through the obstacles posed by Presidents Reagan and Bush, as well as the chairman of the Republican National Committee, Lee Atwater, to seize a seat in the Louisiana State Legislature.

The 38-year-old Duke is currently the chairman of the National Association for the Advancement of White People. The association's newspaper is filled with articles opposing blacks and Jews. Although Duke claims he left the KKK ten years ago, his phone number is still listed under the KKK in the local phone directory. Even before the election, former President Reagan and President Bush, as well as the chairman of the Republican National Committee, Lee Atwater, made various efforts to prevent this former KKK leader from entering the state legislature. However, Duke still emerged victorious.

Republican leaders are very concerned that in future competitions with the Democratic Party, it will be even more difficult to win the support of the broad black electorate. Therefore, Atwater will convene a meeting of the Republican National Committee's Executive Committee next week to denounce Duke and pass a resolution not to support him.

　　美三Ｋ党头目入选州议会
    新华社华盛顿２月１９日电  （记者陆文岳）美国三Ｋ党头目戴维·杜克，昨晚冲破里根、布什总统以及共和党全国委员会主席阿特瓦特的阻挠，攫取了路易斯安那州议员的席位。
    现年３８岁的杜克目前是全国白人协进会的主席。这个协进会主办的报纸充满了反对黑人和犹太人的文章。尽管杜克自称１０年前就脱离了三Ｋ党，但在当地电话号码簿上他的号码仍列在三Ｋ党一栏里。早在选举之前，前总统里根和布什总统以及共和党全国委员会主席李·阿特瓦特为阻止这个三Ｋ党前头目进入州议会作了种种努力，结果杜克还是获胜。
    共和党领导人十分担心今后在与民主党的竞争中更难争取到广大黑人选民的支持，因此，阿特瓦特下周将召集共和党全国委员会执行委员会议声讨杜克并将作出不支持杜克的决议。
