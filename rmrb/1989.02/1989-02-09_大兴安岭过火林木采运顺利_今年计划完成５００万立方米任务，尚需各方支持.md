The logging and transportation of burnt timber in the Great Khingan Range have proceeded smoothly. The task of completing 50 million cubic meters this year is now sternly before the builders.

After experts conducted investigations, it was determined that the burnt timber in the Great Khingan Range must be fully logged and transported out within three years, by 1990. This year is the second year of comprehensive development for logging and transporting burnt timber, with the plan increasing by 10 million cubic meters compared to last year. Recently, Liu Zhongyi, Deputy Director of the State Planning Commission and Head of the State Council's Coordination Group for the Logging and Transportation of Burnt Timber in the Great Khingan Range, accepted an interview with a reporter. He pointed out: The task of logging and transporting burnt timber is still very arduous. The main problems faced are the tight railway transport capacity, the tense supply of fuel, and the increase in timber inventory. He hopes that relevant departments will continue to provide close cooperation and strong support.

　　大兴安岭过火林木采运顺利
　　今年计划完成５００万立方米任务，尚需各方支持
    本报讯  大兴安岭火烧木的抢采抢运工作在提前１１天完成１９８８年度计划后，今年５００万立方米任务已严峻地摆在建设者面前。
    经专家们考察，灾后大兴安岭的火烧木必须在３年内，即１９９０年以前全部抢运出来。今年是火烧木抢采抢运全面开发的第２年，安排计划比去年增加了１００万立方米。国家计委副主任、国务院大兴安岭火烧木抢采抢运协调小组组长刘中一，最近接受记者采访时指出：抢采抢运火烧木的任务还非常艰巨，铁路运力、燃料供应紧张、木材库存增加是面临的主要问题，希望有关部门继续给以密切合作和大力支持。
