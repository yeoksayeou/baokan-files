A Century of Nightmare

—Reading Qian Gang's New Reportage "Sea Burial"

Su Xiaokang

Although I only read Ye Nan's "The Battle of the Yalu River" as a child and later often encountered this deep wound in texts about the late Qing Dynasty or modern history, its imprint is extremely profound. Now, reading Qian Gang's new work "Sea Burial" (published in "Liberation Army Literature and Arts" 1989 Issue 1), the great tragedy a hundred years ago is all brought back to life. The political turmoil, the rise and fall of the Self-Strengthening Movement, the roar of the sea battle, the sinking of the great ships, the darkness of the empire, the ferocity of the pirates—all seem to appear before my eyes, making one cover the book and sigh in sorrow.

"Sea Burial" combines the style of a historian, a cold and profound cultural philosophy, and the skillful technique of surveying historical events and capturing meaningful historical details. It also includes a strong sense of crisis and a modern military consciousness, presenting a tragic song of reform for the Chinese people in the late 1980s who are in the midst of reform pains.

Perhaps it is only when we today discard various prejudices, brush away the dust of history, and especially when we ourselves are engaged in reform, that we can acknowledge with a more impartial attitude that the great naval defense plan initiated in 1874 and the Self-Strengthening Movement established by Li Hongzhang and the Beiyang Fleet, were indeed a reform, and a unprecedented move in the face of the "unprecedented changes in thousands of years" and the passive situation of China! Regardless of other things, Li Hongzhang's boldness and strategy in defying public opinion, disregarding the accusations of the conservative faction of "using barbarians to change China," loudly advocating "reforming to strengthen the enemy," and painstakingly planning, exhausting all means, and navigating through all difficulties to purchase ironclad warships—these two points alone are enough to show his courage and strategy. After all, China's navy still does not have a 7300-ton warship today!

Indeed, the two 7000-ton giant ships "Zhenyuan" and "Dingyuan" ultimately could not save China. In the First Sino-Japanese War, the Beiyang Fleet was annihilated, Ding Ruchang committed suicide, preserving his reputation, but Li Hongzhang left behind an infamous reputation that is difficult to wash away. For a hundred years, the Chinese people have only known how to criticize the Self-Strengthening Movement and curse Li Hongzhang, but they have not gone to study the root cause of this tragedy.

I guess Qian Gang's original intention was not to rehabilitate Li Hongzhang, nor was it to rewrite a book about the Battle of the Yalu River. I remember about three years ago, I met Qian Gang, and I asked him: What are you working on recently? He said: I haven't decided what to write, I'm just immersed in the history of the late Qing Dynasty, and I'm very interested. At that time, I really couldn't think of how "late Qing history" was related to contemporary reportage, and I didn't know what "treasure" he was brewing. After reading "Sea Burial," I finally understood his deep thoughts.

The segment of modern history that Qian Gang focuses on, that is, the more than fifty years from the First Opium War (1840) to the Battle of the Yalu River (1894), is indeed the most critical half-century that determined China's irreversible slide into a tragic fate of modernization. To put it bluntly, it is because of the mistakes of this half-century that we have irreversibly become latecomers to modernization and fallen behind, embarking on a path that is difficult to cut and untangle. The bitter part of this is that after being surpassed by Japan this time, we have never been able to catch up with it, and our modernization process has been repeatedly interfered with and destroyed by it.

If we say that before 1850, when the Qing Dynasty of China, the Tokugawa Shogunate of Japan, and the Tsarist Russia all faced the challenge of the West, China at that time had social conditions for transforming into modernity, such as borders, national strength, official teams, and education levels, all far surpassed Japan and Russia. The late Qing literati class, under the influence of the philosophy of "practical learning for the world," in exploring the West, understanding the West, studying maritime affairs, and catching up urgently, also led Japan by at least ten to twenty years. Therefore, when the ironclad ships of the Beiyang Fleet sailed the oceans, Japan even produced the "fear of Dingyuan syndrome" and "fear of Zhenyuan syndrome," and children playing would do games of "sinking Dingyuan and Zhenyuan." However, this leading advantage was quickly lost in 40 years, and the outcome of the Battle of the Yalu River was determined. Therefore, when the American scholar Rhoadsman talked about this segment of history, he said: "China's entry into the transformation of modernization was about 40 years later than Japan and Russia. It was these 40 years that Japan and Russia, because of their considerable achievements in modernization construction, had already become great powers in Asia. The problem of latecomer countries in modernization is not only different from that of pioneer countries, but the later they start, the more serious the problem may be—because the policies in the initial stage of transformation are even more lacking in autonomy, and the international environment puts more direct and harsh pressure on the decision-making group than it does on Japan and Russia. This international environment makes China's internal control and coordination more complex; the outflow of financial resources also makes China's modernization economy grow more slowly." After the Battle of the Yalu River, the continuous cession of territory, indemnities, loss of sovereignty and humiliation, and the chaos of warlords after the collapse of imperial power, until the later invasion of China, undoubtedly made China's modernization process suffer repeated setbacks.

Why did China fall behind Japan and Russia and end up like this? Qian Gang uses "Sea Burial"—a historical play of a complex and arduous naval construction intertwined with the construction of the Summer Palace, a tragic and incomplete figure of Li Hongzhang who both wanted to reform and was not thorough, a series of political struggles full of misguided actions and cruel sea battles that missed the opportunity, a comparison between Li Hongzhang and Ito Hirobumi, Guangxu and Peter, the Self-Strengthening Movement and the Meiji Restoration of Japan, and a wonderful contrast between a hundred years ago and a hundred years later, etc., to give us an answer that is both academic and artistic. I think, what people read from it is certainly not just history.

In "Sea Burial," the author is adept and unrestrained between the macro and micro, history and reality, events and characters. Especially for the exquisite depiction and description of those historical details with profound implications, it is astonishing. In the tide of reportage works that are flooding in today, there are many that list examples and pile up materials, rough and shoddy, unbearable to read. I think the appearance of "Sea Burial" should be regarded as a powerful correction to this style.

"Sea Burial" weaves a nightmare from a hundred years ago and presents it to the world again, reminding China that it must never reenact the nightmare. In this sense, it is not only a warning to the world but also an excellent textbook for modern education.

### 百年恶梦——读钱钢报告文学新作《海葬》

　　百年恶梦
    ——读钱钢报告文学新作《海葬》
    苏晓康
    我虽然只是小时候看过叶楠的《甲午海战》，后来又总是在晚清或有关近代史的文字里触摸到这个巨创，但它的烙印却是极深的。今读钱钢新作《海葬》（载《解放军文艺》１９８９年１期），百年前的那场大悲剧被他一一勾沉出来，政潮起伏、洋务沉浮，海战隆隆、巨艨倾覆，帝国昏暗，海寇凶悍，仿佛都重现眼前，读之令人掩卷扼腕。
    《海葬》以其史家风格、冷峻而深邃的文化哲学眼光、纵览历史风云与捕捉意味深长的历史细节相结合的娴熟技巧，再加上一种浓烈的忧患情绪和现代军人意识，为８０年代末正处于改革阵痛之中的中国人，诉了一幕并非久远的改革悲歌。
    或许只有当我们今天摈除种种偏见、拂去历史尘埃，特别是当我们自己也在从事改革的时候，才能够以比较公正的态度承认，始之于１８７４年的海防大筹议，并由李鸿章创办洋务运动和北洋海军，的确也是一场改革，而且是在中国遭受“数千年未有之变局”的被动态势之下猝然应变的旷古未有之举！别的不论，李鸿章力排众议，置顽固派“用夷变夏”的指责于不顾，大声疾呼“变法强敌”，并苦心经营、百般筹措、四方周旋、千辛万苦购买铁甲舰，仅此两桩，足见其胆识和谋略。要知道，中国的海军直到今天还没有７３００吨级的兵舰呢！
    诚然，７０００吨级的“定远”、“镇远”两艘巨舰终于未能挽救中国。甲午一战，北洋海军覆没，丁汝昌自杀，保住了名节，李鸿章却留下了难以洗刷的骂名。百年来，国人只知贬洋务、骂李氏，却并不去研究这场悲剧的根源在哪里。
    我猜钱钢的本意，不在为李鸿章翻案，也不在于重写一部《甲午海战》。记得约三年前，碰到钱钢，我问他：最近搞什么？他说：没想好写什么，只沉浸在晚清史里面，兴味甚浓。当时我实在想不出，这“晚清史”与贴近现实的报告文学有何关系，不知他在憋什么“宝”？读罢《海葬》，才知他用心之深。
    钱钢所瞩目的近代这段历史，亦即第一次鸦片战争（１８４０年）到甲午海战（１８９４年）的５０余年，实在是决定了中国的现代化不可逆转的堕入悲剧命运的最关键的半个世纪。说得直率一点，就是因为这半个世纪的贻误，我们无可挽回地由现代化的后来者沦为落伍者，走上了一条剪不断理还乱的歧途。这当中令人苦涩的便是，我们在这一次被日本超过之后再也没能撵上它，而我们的现代化进程一再遭到它的干扰和破坏。
    要说，在１８５０年以前，当清朝中国、德川日本和沙皇俄国同时面临西方挑战时，中国当时所具有的向现代化转换的社会条件，如疆界、国力、官吏队伍以及教育程度，都远远超出日、俄。晚清士大夫阶层在“经世致用”哲学的影响下，在探索西方、了解西方、研究海事、急起直追等方面，也领先于日本至少一二十年。因此，当北洋的铁甲舰游弋大洋时，日本国内竟产生“恐定远症”“恐镇远症”，儿童玩耍时都做“打沉定远、镇远”的游戏。然而，这领先的优势，在４０年里很快丧失，甲午一战，胜败定局。因此，美国学者罗兹曼谈到这段历史时曾说：“中国迈入现代化转换大约比日、俄晚了４０年。就是这４０年，日、俄因其在现代化建设方面获得的可观成就已成为亚洲大国。现代化后起国家的问题，不仅不同于先行国家，而后起得越晚、问题就可能越严重——因为转换初期的政策就更加缺乏自主性，国际环境对决策集团的压力比起对日本和俄国来就更为直接而强硬。这种国际环境使中国的内部控制和协调更加复杂化；财源外流也使中国现代化经济的增长更为缓慢。”甲午之后的接连割地赔款、丧权辱国，以及皇权崩溃后的军阀混战、暗无天日，直到后来的侵华战争，无疑都使中国的现代化进程倍遭挫折。
    中国为什么会落后于日俄而致于今日？钱钢用《海葬》——一场备尝艰辛、错综复杂的海军建设与颐和园建设交织的“双轨运行”的历史戏，一个既想变革又不彻底的极具悲剧色彩的李鸿章形象，一幕幕充满误国之举的政治倾轧和贻误战机的残酷海战，一番李鸿章与伊藤博文、光绪与彼得、洋务运动与日本明治维新的横向比较，一种百年前与百年后的绝妙对照，等等，给了我们一个既是学术的也是艺术的回答。我想，人们从中读到的，决不仅仅是历史。
    在《海葬》中，作者在宏观与微观、历史与现实、事件与人物之间，游刃有余、汪洋恣意。尤其对于那些寓意隽永的历史细节的精彩刻划和描述，令人拍案叫绝。在如今潮水般涌来的报告文学作品之中，罗列事例、堆砌材料之作甚多，粗糙滥造，不忍卒读。《海葬》的出现，我以为应当视为对这种文风的一个有力的匡正。
    《海葬》把一个百年前的恶梦重新编织给世人看，乃是提醒中国再也不可重演恶梦。在这个意义上，它就不仅是一篇警世之作，还是一部现代化教育的极好的教科书。
