    Peng Chong, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, recently wrote a preface for the forthcoming book "Essential Reading for Enterprise Managers – Special Issue on the Enterprise Law." He emphasized that enterprise managers and supervisory departments must learn to operate and manage enterprises in accordance with the law, making contributions in the process of rectification and deepening reform.

    In the preface, Peng Chong stated that an excellent enterprise manager must not only master certain scientific, technological, and managerial knowledge but also possess a certain level of legal knowledge. Enterprise managers should establish the concept that whatever is stipulated by the Enterprise Law and other laws and regulations must be strictly followed. They should be adept at using legal means to protect the interests of the enterprise and conduct various business activities in accordance with the law.

    He further pointed out that the law is a special behavioral norm that reflects objective laws. Acting in accordance with legal provisions is not about constraining enterprises with rigid rules and regulations, nor is it about limiting the autonomy of enterprise operations. On the contrary, it grants enterprise managers genuine freedom and ensures the normal economic order of the enterprise, thereby establishing a solid foundation for the new order of socialist commodity economy.

    The preface mentioned that the Third Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Party determined the policy of rectifying the economic environment, rectifying the economic order, and deepening comprehensive reforms. In the multi-faceted comprehensive reforms, it is particularly important to conscientiously implement the Enterprise Law, deepen enterprise reforms, and truly establish a mechanism of autonomous operation, self-responsibility for profits and losses, and self-discipline for enterprises, especially large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, under the macro-control of the state.

    He concluded by writing: This book compiles the Enterprise Law and its supporting laws and regulations, as well as important speeches by Party and state leaders and relevant department heads on the serious implementation of the Enterprise Law. It also provides concise explanations of the main provisions of the Enterprise Law. It will help enterprise comrades to better learn and master the basic spirit of the Enterprise Law, and make outstanding contributions.

　　彭冲为《企业经营者必读》作序强调    
    学会依法经营管理企业
    本报讯  记者鲁牧报道：全国人大常委会副委员长彭冲，最近为即将出版的《企业经营者必读——〈企业法〉特辑》一书撰写序言强调，企业经营者以及主管部门都要学会依法经营管理企业，在治理整顿、深化改革中做出贡献。
    彭冲在《序言》中说，一个优秀的企业经营者，不仅要掌握一定的科学、技术和管理知识，而且必须具有一定的法律知识。企业经营者应树立这样一种观念：《企业法》和其他法律、法规作出规定的，就必须坚决依法去做。要善于运用法律的武器保护企业的权益，依法开展各种经营活动。
    他还指出，法律是作为客观规律一种反映的特殊行动规范。按照法律规定去做，并不是用条条框框束缚企业，更不是限制企业的经营自主权。相反，它使企业经营者获得真正的自由，并保障企业正常经济秩序，从而使社会主义商品经济新秩序建立在扎实的基础上。
    序言说，党的十三届三中全会确定了治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序、全面深化改革方针。在多方面的综合改革中，必须特别注意认真贯彻执行《企业法》，深化企业改革，使企业特别是大中型全民所有制企业真正建立起在国家宏观控制下的自主经营、自负盈亏、自我约束的机制。
    他最后写道：本书汇集了《企业法》及其配套的法律、法规，党和国家领导人及有关部门负责人关于认真实施《企业法》的重要讲话，并以精炼的文字对《企业法》的主要条文作了解说。它有助于企业界同志们更好地学习和掌握《企业法》的基本精神，以优异成绩做出自己的贡献。
