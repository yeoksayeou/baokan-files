	Taiwan authorities have decided to relax restrictions on the number of times residents can visit the mainland for family reasons, but they insist on maintaining the ban on direct trade and investment.

	According to a report from our Hong Kong bureau on February 22, Taipei news: The "Administrative Yuan Mainland Affairs Council" decided on the 21st to cancel the regulation that limits mainland visits for illness or funeral purposes to once a year. Various Taiwan newspapers reported that if Taiwanese residents' parents, spouses, or children on the mainland fall seriously ill or pass away, and they need to return to the mainland again within the same year, they will not be subject to the restriction of only one return visit per year.

	The "Mainland Affairs Council" issued a "reaffirmation" stating: The authorities tolerate and implicitly allow indirect trade between the two sides but prohibit direct trade and investment.

	Spokesperson for the "Mainland Affairs Council" Shao Yuming claimed that regarding cross-strait economic and trade issues, "those who violate the law will be dealt with according to the law."

	The "Council" also announced that if mainland compatriots who come to Taiwan for illness or funeral purposes overstay and refuse to return to the mainland, they will be deported. The Taiwan authorities set a deadline of two months, and so far, there have been no cases of overstaying and refusing to return to the mainland.

　　台湾当局决定
    放宽赴大陆探亲次数限制
    却坚持不许直接贸易投资
    本报香港２月２２日电  台北消息：台湾“行政院大陆工作会报”２１日决定，取消岛内民众前往大陆探病奔丧一年限一次的规定。台湾各报报道说，台民众在大陆的父母、配偶、子女因患重病或死亡，同年需再赴大陆探病奔丧者，可以不受一年仅返乡一次的限制。
    “大陆工作会报”作出一项“重申”曰：当局容忍默许两岸间接贸易，禁止直接贸易及投资行为。
    台湾“行政院大陆工作会报”发言人邵玉铭声称，有关两岸经贸问题，“凡违法者，将依法处置”。
    该“会报”还宣布，大陆同胞赴台探病、奔丧后，如有逾期而拒绝返回大陆者，将予以遣送出境。台当局规定期限为两个月，到目前为止，并没有逾期未返回大陆者。
