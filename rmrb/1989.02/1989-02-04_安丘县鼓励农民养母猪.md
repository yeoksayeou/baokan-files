Recently, farmers in Anqiu County who raise sows have been holding their pig-raising grain purchase cards and happily buying subsidized grain from local grain management offices. The county's pig-raising enthusiasm, which had previously declined, is beginning to rise again.

Since the winter, grain prices in the county's markets have surged, increasing the cost of raising pigs for farmers, and the price of piglets has dropped significantly. Some pig farmers have started to slaughter and castrate sows. In response, the county's Party Committee and government have decided to allocate 150,000 kilograms of subsidized grain and 1,500 tons of chemical fertilizer as subsidies and rewards. Each sow will receive a subsidy of 50 kilograms of grain and 50 kilograms of subsidized chemical fertilizer. Townships and towns will also provide a certain amount of labor service subsidies to farmers who raise sows. At the same time, relevant departments at the county, township, and town levels have universally signed sow inventory contracts with pig farmers to prevent the outflow of pigs and sows. Those who privately purchase and slaughter sows will be fined 250 yuan for each slaughtered sow, and taxes will be levied at double the rate. For sows that are normally culled, it is stipulated that they must have a certificate issued by the veterinary department, thereby eliminating the phenomenon of indiscriminate slaughter of sows. It is estimated that by this spring, the county's sow inventory will reach 30,000.

　　安丘县鼓励农民养母猪
    最近一段时间，我县饲养母猪的农民手持养猪购粮卡，高高兴兴地到当地粮管所购买平价粮食，全县一度下降的养猪热又开始回升。
    入冬以来，我县市场粮价急剧上涨，农民养猪成本增高，仔猪价格大幅度下降，一些养猪户开始宰杀和阉割母猪。对此，县委、县政府为了鼓励农民养母猪，决定拿出１５０万公斤平价粮和１５００吨化肥作为补助和奖励，每头母猪补贴５０公斤粮食，奖售平价化肥５０公斤。各乡、镇还对养母猪的农户给予一定数量的义务工补贴。同时，县、乡、镇有关部门普遍与养猪户签订了母猪存栏合同，严防生猪和母猪外流。对私自收购宰杀母猪的，每宰杀一头，罚款２５０元，并加成加倍收税。对正常淘汰的母猪，也规定必须由兽医部门出具证明，从而杜绝了滥宰杀母猪的现象。预计今年春天，全县母猪存栏数可达３万头。
