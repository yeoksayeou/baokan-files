The first meeting of the Afghan Consultative Council was indefinitely postponed due to disagreements over seat allocation.

The meeting was scheduled to take place yesterday afternoon in Rawalpindi. Out of the 526 members of the council, 420 attended, with the majority being representatives from the Afghan Seven-Party Alliance based in Pakistan. The Afghan Eight-Party Alliance, which operates from Iran, did not send any representatives, nor did the "upright Muslims" from the Kabul government attend.

The meeting lasted only two hours and did not announce a date for reconvening. However, some sources suggested that another meeting might be held tomorrow.

The postponement was due to a disagreement between the Eight-Party Alliance and the Seven-Party Alliance over the allocation of seats in the consultative council. The Eight-Party Alliance demanded 100 seats, while the Seven-Party Alliance only agreed to 60.

Earlier this month, Seven-Party Alliance Chairman Mujaddidi visited Iran and signed an agreement with the Eight-Party Alliance, agreeing to allocate 100 seats to the Eight-Party Alliance. However, upon returning to Pakistan, other leaders of the Seven-Party Alliance refused to honor the agreement Mujaddidi had signed in Iran.

Yesterday in Islamabad, Eight-Party Alliance leader Khalili stated that he and his delegation boycotted the consultative council meeting because the Seven-Party Alliance had violated the agreement he had recently signed with Mujaddidi.

After the meeting, Mujaddidi told reporters that the Seven-Party Alliance would do everything possible to ensure the Eight-Party Alliance's participation.

Last month, the Afghan Seven-Party Alliance and Eight-Party Alliance decided to establish a consultative council to govern the country after the complete withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan on February 15. The consultative council is composed of representatives from various resistance factions, guerrilla commanders, refugees, intellectuals, tribal elders, and "upright Muslims" from the Kabul government, totaling 526 members.

　　八党联盟和七党联盟在席位分配上出现分歧    
    阿富汗协商委员会会议无限期推迟
    新华社伊斯兰堡２月１１日电  阿富汗协商委员会第一次会议，由于席位分配意见分歧，宣布无限期地推迟。
    这次会议昨天下午在拉瓦尔品第举行。协商委员会５２６名成员中的４２０人出席了会议，其中绝大多数是设在巴基斯坦的阿富汗７党联盟的代表。以伊朗为基地的阿富汗８党联盟没有派代表参加会议，喀布尔政权中的“正直穆斯林”也没有出席会议。
    这次会议只进行了２个小时便告结束，也没有宣布复会的日期。但是，一些人士说，可能在明天再举行会议。
    这次会议是由于８党联盟和７党联盟在协商委员会中的席位分配问题上产生了分歧而被推迟的。８党联盟要求１００个席位，而７党联盟只答应６０个席位。
    ７党联盟主席穆贾迪迪本月早些时候访问伊朗时同８党联盟签署一项协议，同意分配给８党联盟１００个席位。
    但是，穆贾迪迪本周回到巴基斯坦后，７党联盟的其他领导人拒绝遵守他在伊朗同８党联盟签署的协议。
    ８党联盟领导人哈利利昨天在伊斯兰堡说，他和他的代表团抵制协商委员会的这次会议，因为７党联盟破坏了他同穆贾迪迪最近签署的协议。
    穆贾迪迪会后对记者说，７党联盟将尽一切努力使８党联盟参加会议。
    阿富汗７党联盟和８党联盟上个月早些时候决定成立一个协商委员会，以便在２月１５日苏联军队全部撤出阿富汗之后治理这个国家。协商委员会将由抵抗力量各党派、游击队指挥官、难民、知识分子、部落长老以及喀布尔政权中的“正直穆斯林”代表组成，成员为５２６人。
