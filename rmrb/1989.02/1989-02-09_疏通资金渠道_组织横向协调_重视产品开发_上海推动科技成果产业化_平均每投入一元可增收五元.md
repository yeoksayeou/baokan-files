Shanghai Industrial Technology Development Foundation leverages its financial and potential advantages to provide various services, achieving remarkable results in promoting the industrialization of scientific and technological achievements. They have supported and assisted 469 units in industrializing 509 projects to varying degrees, with an average return of 5 yuan for every 1 yuan invested.

Established in January 1985, the Shanghai Industrial Technology Development Foundation is one of the earliest foundations in the country and operates as a semi-official, semi-private organization. After conducting technical and economic assessments and evaluations of various types of achievements or projects, they provide assistance in the following ways:

	— Facilitating funding channels. For pioneering research achievements, high-technology projects with significant economic benefits, or through risk investment, subsidies, or providing low-interest loans through banks to facilitate funding, enabling achievements to scale up production after pilot testing. In 1986, the Foundation allocated 780,000 yuan to the Shanghai Institute of Metallurgy, Chinese Academy of Sciences, for the pilot testing of aluminum-containing easy-to-machine steel. After two years of effort, it now has the conditions for medium-scale production. At the same time, the Foundation also supported the development of four scientific and technological achievements, including electronic cochleae and glasses for the blind, and provided low-interest loans for 28 scientific and technological achievements, including BGO. For this, the Foundation, relying on its own 14 million yuan, cooperated with the banking, financial, and business sectors to raise and invest a total of 288 million yuan. Over four years, the recovery rate of the invested funds reached 98.5%.

	— Organizing horizontal coordination to enable some cross-industry, cross-departmental research cooperation projects to enter production in a timely manner. Aramid fiber is a strong, fine, and white fiber with a wide range of applications. As early as the 1970s, the Shanghai Municipal Commission of Science and Technology organized a breakthrough in technology and began small-scale production. However, due to the management system of divided jurisdictions, the process of converting achievements into commodities was divided, making it impossible to expand production. Shortly after the Foundation's establishment, it accepted a commission from relevant departments to undertake the coordination work for the pilot production of aramid fiber, improving the product's performance and output. It also organized experts to write a report on the feasibility of expanding pilot production. Now, aramid fiber has been included in the national "Seventh Five-Year Plan" key industrial test projects.

	— Establishing technology development companies to directly engage in the development and production of new technology products. The Shanghai Public Security Company undertook the task of designing and installing security devices for some hotels and banks, developing a series of door chain alarm locks, door chain alarm latch locks, electronic code locks, and electronic safes. The Shanghai Optoelectronic Technology Company gathered talents in lasers, infrared, electronic computers, and optics, and in just one year, developed and produced 9 new products. Currently, the Foundation has 32 development-type companies under its jurisdiction, accelerating the industrialization of scientific and technological achievements.

    本报上海电  上海工业技术发展基金会依靠财力与潜力优势提供多种服务，在促进科技成果产业化方面取得显著成绩。他们支持、帮助４６９个单位的５０９个项目不同程度地实现产业化，平均每投入１元钱就能增加５元的效益。
    １９８５年１月成立的上海工业技术发展基金会，是国内最早出现的基金会之一，是个半官半民的组织。他们对各类成果或项目作了技术与经济的评估和论证之后，采取如下形式给予帮助：
    ——疏通资金渠道。对于那些开创性的研究成果，技术水平高、经济效益大的技术项目，或作风险投资或进行资助或通过银行提供贴息贷款以及融通资金，使成果通过中试后扩大生产。１９８６年，基金会拨款７８万元给中科院上海冶金研究所，用于含铝易切削钢中试，经过两年努力，现已具备中规模生产条件。同时，基金会还资助了电子耳蜗、盲人眼镜等４项科技成果的开发，向ＢＧＯ等２８项科技成果提供了贴息贷款。为此，基金会依靠自有的１４００万元与银行界、金融界、企业界配合，共融通、投放了２．８８亿元。４年中，投出资金的回收率达９８．５％。
    ——组织横向协调，使一些跨行业、跨部门的科研协作项目能及时投入生产。芳砜纶是一种又白又细的强力纤维，用途很广。早在７０年代上海市科委组织攻关，已经突破了技术难关，并开始了小批量生产。但是，由于参加攻关的单位隶属于４个局、７个公司，条块分割的管理体制将成果转化为商品的过程分割开来，无法扩大生产。基金会成立不久，接受有关部门委托，承担了组织芳砜纶中试生产的协调工作，使产品性能和产量都有提高，并且组织专家写出了扩大中试生产的论证报告。现在，芳砜纶已列入国家“七五”重点工业性试验项目。
    ——建立科技开发型公司，直接从事新技术产品的开发和生产。上海公共安全公司承接了为一些宾馆、银行设计安装安全保险装置的任务，试制成系列门链报警锁、门链报警弹子门锁、电子密码锁以及电子保险箱。上海光电技术公司集中了激光、红外、电子计算机、光学等专业的人才，短短一年中就开发生产了９个新产品。目前，基金会下属共有３２家开发型公司，加速了科技成果产业化的进程。
