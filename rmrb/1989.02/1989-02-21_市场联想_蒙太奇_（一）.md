Through the "unit economy" channel, I bought two trays of frozen shrimp. Naturally, there was some joy: I could make a dish of stir-fried shrimp. In the past, it was difficult to buy large shrimp, but in recent years, they have become more abundant, which is worth celebrating. However, when I picked up the heavy block of ice, I still felt a bit uncomfortable: why add so much water when freezing shrimp? Under a layer of shrimp, there was a full inch of "pure ice." By weight, this block was about seventy to eighty percent water. Why not add less water and freeze it more beautifully? This would reduce transportation costs and make it easier to store in the refrigerator. Is the freezing technology not yet solved, or is it beneficial for water pressure and appearance? If it is the latter, today's consumers probably would not be happy to buy heavy blocks of ice.

Products are abundant, which is a kind of richness. However, some products are not the more the better. I saw in the newspaper that China's white liquor production ranks first in the world. A reader commented: "This championship is not glorious." Well said. With our country's grain supply being so inadequate, why produce so much strong white liquor? It's just that making liquor is more profitable. Can the tax law restrict this aspect?

I thought of moon cakes. The Mid-Autumn Festival has passed for three or four months, but there are still two or three boxes of moon cakes in my family's cabinet. These were given to the elderly by relatives and friends during the Mid-Autumn Festival; they couldn't consume them, so they passed them on to us. The younger generation also couldn't consume them, and now they have become as hard as stone. This situation is not unique to a few families; just look at the scene of people rushing to buy moon cakes at that time. Originally, moon cakes were meant to be eaten, but after becoming gifts, their edible function was overshadowed by their gift function. But if these gifts are not eaten or cannot be eaten, they become waste. Why waste the grain that was so hard to produce? Can the way of giving gifts be changed? It is said that in Hong Kong, people often give each other baskets of wooden (or perhaps later plastic) red eggs as gifts. Initially, this seemed laughable, but upon further thought, it might be a worthwhile improvement.

　　市场联想“蒙太奇”（一）
    丛名仁
    通过“单位经济”的渠道，买来两盘冻虾。自然有几分喜悦：可以作一道烹大虾了。过去很难买到的大虾，近几年确实多起来了，也值得高兴。可是，捧起那沉甸甸的冰坨总还有些不是滋味：干吗冷冻虾的时候要加进那么多的水？在一层虾下面，足足有一寸厚的“纯冰”。按重量算，这个坨子，水的分量占十之七八。为什么不能少加点水，冻得漂亮一点儿，既可以减少运输费用，又可以减少体积便于在冰箱里保存？是冷冻技术未解决，还是有益于水压分量、壮门面？如果是后者，那么今日的消费者恐怕也不会乐于买沉甸甸的大冰块了。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    商品多了，算是一种丰富。可有的商品不是越多越好。看见报上说，我国白酒产量居世界首位。一位读者加批道：“这个冠军并不光彩”。批得好。我国粮食这么不充裕，搞那么多烈性白酒干什么？无非是造酒盈利多。税法能否在这方面加以限制？　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    联想到月饼。中秋节已经过去三四个月了，我家的柜橱子里，还存放着两三盒月饼。那是中秋时亲戚朋友送给老人的，他们“消化”不了，转送来了，中小辈也未“消化”得了，现已变得坚硬如石了。这种情况，未必只在极少数家庭中发生，只稍看看当时蜂拥争购月饼的场面便知。本来是为了吃的月饼，变成礼品之后吃的效用反而让步给礼的效用了。但这种礼如果不吃或吃不了就形成浪费。为什么好不容易生产的粮食这样浪费掉呢？这种货这类送礼的方式方法可不可改一改呢？据说在香港人们之间送礼往往是挎着一筐木制的（也许后来有塑料的了）红鸡蛋，你送我，我送你。初闻，觉得可笑，细想，恐怕是一种值得效法的进步。
