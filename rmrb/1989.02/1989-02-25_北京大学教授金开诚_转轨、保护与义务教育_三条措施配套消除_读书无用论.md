The "reading is useless" theory is once again spreading across the nation, and this is an obvious fact. To change this situation, the following three coordinated measures should be primarily adopted:

The first measure is to transition the teaching in higher education institutions to meet the actual needs of society in cultivating talents. Simultaneously, more vocational schools should be established to ensure that students can quickly apply what they have learned. Through this approach, the majority of intellectuals should be those who have been cultivated in this manner; their remuneration should be determined by the actual role they play in their professional activities.

The second measure is to resolutely guarantee the corresponding remuneration for a portion of intellectuals. For example, teachers in primary and secondary schools, as well as researchers and workers in basic, cutting-edge, theoretical, and niche disciplines (apologies for not listing them all). These intellectuals serve the reproduction of talents and science and technology culture, and their benefits lie in the future. Therefore, it is not possible to demand that they all create material wealth immediately. To ensure that this portion of intellectuals can work with peace of mind and that their profession is attractive to future generations, the state must allocate funds to ensure that, under the premise of streamlining and optimizing personnel, this portion of intellectuals receives a remuneration that is generally acceptable.

Of course, schools and other scientific research, cultural, and medical institutions can also engage in development and revenue generation. However, this should only be achieved through reasonable division of labor, appropriate use of talents, and operation within one's capabilities, rather than assigning the task of development and revenue generation to every individual.

The third measure is to firmly implement the Compulsory Education Law, and if necessary, do not hesitate to use legal coercive measures. Without a compulsory education system, allowing the cultural quality of the nation to decline for a long time, not only will the "reading is useless" theory be impossible to eliminate, but the cultural tide will be difficult to reverse, and other beautiful social ideals will also be unattainable.

In fact, solving the problem of "reading is useless" is not very mysterious. Everyone knows some key measures, and what is needed now is to make a firm decision and implement them as soon as possible.

　　北京大学教授金开诚——
    转轨、保护与义务教育
    三条措施配套消除“读书无用论”
    “读书无用论”又一次在全国蔓延，这已是个明显的事实。为了改变这种情况，主要应采取三条相互配套的措施：
    第一条是高等学校的教学要转轨，要根据社会的实际需要来培养人才；同时多办技校和职校，使学生所学的东西很快就用得上。通过这种途径培养出来的人，应占知识分子的多数；他们所得的待遇则将由他们在职业活动中所发挥的实际作用来决定。
    第二条，下决心保证一部分知识分子相应的待遇。比如大中小学的教师，基础学科、尖端学科、理论学科以至冷门学科的研究和工作人员等等（恕不一一罗列）。这些知识分子是为人才和科技文化的再生产服务的，效益在于未来，所以不能要求他们都去立竿见影地创造物质财富。为了使这部分知识分子能够安心工作，并使他们的职业对后来者有吸引力，国家就是要拿出钱来，使这部分知识分子在人员精简、优化组合的前提下，得到大致上说得过去的待遇。
    当然，学校和其它科研、文化、医卫等机构也可以搞开发创收，但只能通过合理分工、量才使用、量力经营，而不能把开发创收的任务落实到每一个人的头上。
    第三条就是坚决贯彻《义务教育法》，必要时不排斥依法使用强制的手段。没有义务教育制，让国民的文化素质长期滑坡，不要说“读书无用论”无法消除，文化落潮难以逆转，其它一切美好的社会理想也都实现不了。
    解决“读书无用”的问题，其实没有多少奥秘，一些关键措施大家都知道，现在所需要的只是下定决心，付诸实施，越快越好。
