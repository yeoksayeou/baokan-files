The Federal Reserve raises the discount rate, New York stock market plunges

	The People's Daily, Washington, February 25 - Reporter Cang Lide: Yesterday and today, the U.S. financial market underwent dramatic changes. Following the Federal Reserve's announcement of credit tightening yesterday morning, today it raised the discount rate from 6.5% to 7%. Leading this move, Chase Manhattan Bank and other major banks across the country raised their prime lending rates by half a percentage point to 11.5%. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Wall Street fell by over 40 points in two days, causing the index to drop by 79.28 points in a week, resulting in a 4.1% loss in value.

	The direct cause of the Federal Reserve's tightening monetary policy is the sharp increase in the U.S. January consumer price index. The Federal Reserve (the central bank) is concerned that this could be a signal of continuous price increases and rising inflation. If no action is taken to stabilize prices and curb the worsening trend of inflation, the U.S. economy could face a recession.

	Since the Federal Reserve raised the discount rate by 0.5% seven months ago, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has believed that the U.S. economy is overheating. The main evidence is that the employment rate and industrial capacity utilization rate have reached their highest levels in decades, approaching the "limit." The consequences are twofold: first, wage growth pressure increases, labor costs rise, and consumer prices continue to increase; second, the prices of various raw materials and service fees continue to rise. Therefore, it is necessary to control the actual growth rate of the U.S. economy within the "healthy" range of less than 2%.

	The U.S. economic sector believes that after the Federal Reserve increases the reserve amount lent to commercial banks, it will curb the money supply and circulation in the financial market. After commercial banks raise the prime rate, the lending speed for commercial, construction, automotive, and consumer sectors will be constrained, and the overall economic growth pace will slow down.

	On the issue of interest rates, there is a disagreement between the Federal Reserve and the White House. Both President Bush and White House Chief Economic Advisor Michael Boskin believe that the severity of inflation is not sufficient to warrant raising interest rates. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady went further yesterday, directly criticizing the central bank for "overreacting to inflation."

	The media points out that the Federal Reserve's tightening policy has dampened Bush's plan to reduce the fiscal deficit. Because once the economic growth rate slows down, not only will fiscal revenue decrease, but also for every 1% increase in interest rates, the fiscal deficit's interest payments alone will increase by $4.5 billion annually over the next five years. If this situation occurs, it seems that the White House will face two choices: either increase taxes, breaking Bush's repeated pre- and post-election promises of "no new taxes," or cut budget expenditures, adversely affecting various public spending plans. Regardless of the choice, there will be a political price to pay.

### 美中央银行提高贴现率  纽约股市行情大幅下跌

　　美中央银行提高贴现率  纽约股市行情大幅下跌
    本报华盛顿２月２５日电  记者仓立德报道：昨日至今日，美国金融市场风云突变。继中央银行昨晨宣布紧缩信贷，今天将贴现率由６．５％提至７％后，以大通曼哈顿银行为首，全国各主要银行纷纷将优惠贷款利率提高半个百分点，达到１１．５％。与此同时，纽约华尔街股市道·琼斯工业股票指数两天分别下跌４０余点，使该指数一周内即下降７９．２８点，价值损失达４．１％。
    促使美国中央银行采取这一收缩银根政策的直接原因，是美国１月份消费物价指数激增，联邦储备委员会（即中央银行）担心，这是消费物价不断上涨进而推动通货膨胀率增长的信号，如果不采取行动稳定物价、制止通货膨胀恶化势头，美国经济将会衰退。
    自中央银行７个月前将贴现率提高了０．５％后，联邦储备委员会主席格林斯潘一直认为美国经济过热。主要依据是劳动就业率和工业设备开工率已达十几年来最高水平，接近“极限”。其后果一是工资增长压力加剧，劳动成本增加，促使消费物价不断上涨；二是使各种原材料价格和服务费用等不断提高，因此，有必要将目前美国经济实际增长率控制在２％以下的“健康”范围内。
    美国经济界认为，中央银行提高出借给商业银行货币的储备量后，将遏制金融市场的货币投放量和流通量。商业银行提高优惠利率后，商业、建筑业、汽车业及消费的贷款速度将受到约束，整个经济增长步伐将会放慢。
    在利率问题上，联邦储备委员会与白宫有分歧。布什总统及白宫首席经济顾问博斯金都认为通货膨胀的严重程度不足以采取提高利率的行动。财政部长布雷迪昨天更直接批评中央银行对通膨“担心过度”。
    舆论界指出，中央银行的紧缩政策给布什政府的削减财政赤字计划泼了冷水。因为经济增长速度一旦减慢，不仅财政收入会减少，而且利率每增加１％，今后５年财政赤字单付利息便每年增加４５亿美元。如果出现这种情况，看来白宫将不得不面临两种选择：要么增加税收，收回布什当选前后再三保证的“不增税”许诺；要么削减预算支出，使各项公共开支计划受到不利影响。不管采取何种选择，都是要付出一定政治代价的。
