During the second Chinese Go Name War, the reporter interviewed the deputy head coach of the national Go team, Luo Jianwen, about the current state of Chinese Go.

Reporter: Could you first talk about the situation of this Name War?

Luo Jianwen: The Chinese Go Name War, jointly organized by the Overseas Edition of the People's Daily and the Chinese Go Association, is undoubtedly the largest-scale competition of its kind in the country. Firstly, there are many participants, and they are the elite of the domestic Go scene. Additionally, this competition includes 10 young Go players who rarely have the opportunity to gain practical experience in such major competitions. In this sense, the organizers' decision is wise, as these young players are the hope of Chinese Go.

Reporter: Speaking of young Go players, I think this is also a topic of great interest to our readers. Could you introduce them?

Luo Jianwen: Currently, there is a group of young Go players in the country with quite high levels, such as Chang Hao, Liu Jing, and Luo Xihe. Of course, they are still young. But in four or five years, they will not only be able to challenge domestic high-ranking players but also pose a threat to Japanese masters. Each time Mr. Fujisawa Shuko, the honorary Go saint of Japan, visits China, he expresses his admiration for Chinese young Go players and predicts that they will usher in an era of competition between Chinese and Japanese Go. Currently, compared to Japan, our overall strength is weaker, so we also hope that this group of young players can take on the responsibility as soon as possible.

Of course, we understand that Japan and South Korea also have a group of excellent young Go players. Recently, in the Toyo Securities Cup competition in Japan, two renowned nine-dan players, Ishida Yoshio and Yamashiro Hiroshi, were defeated by a three-dan and a five-dan young player, respectively.

　　中国围棋运动面面观
    ——访国家围棋队副总教练罗建文
    在第二届中国围棋名人战期间，记者就中国围棋运动的状况采访了国家围棋队副总教练罗建文。
    记者：请您先谈谈这次名人战的情况？
    罗建文：由人民日报海外版和中国围棋协会举办的中国围棋名人战无疑是国内同类比赛中规模最大的。首先是参加比赛棋手众多，他们之中荟萃了国内棋坛上的精英。另外，这次比赛有１０名少年棋手参加，他们平时很少有机会在这样重大的比赛中得到实战锻炼。从这个意义上来讲，主办单位这样作乃是明智之举，因为这些小棋手是中国围棋运动的希望之星。
    记者：谈到少年棋手，我想这也是读者十分关心的，您是否能介绍一下。
    罗建文：目前国内有一批水平相当不错的少年棋手，如常昊、刘菁、罗洗河等。当然他们年龄尚小。但四五年之后他们不仅能对国内高段棋手、也将对日本名将形成冲击波。日本名誉棋圣藤泽秀行先生每次来华访问，都表示了对中国少年棋手的赞赏，并预言，他们将会开辟中日围棋相抗衡的时代。目前中日两国围棋相比，我们的总体力量要比日本弱，因而我们也寄希望于这批少年棋手能尽快挑起重任。
    当然，据我们了解，日本和南朝鲜亦有一批优秀的少年棋手。前不久在日本的东洋证券杯比赛中，两位享有盛誉的九段石田芳夫和山城宏就分别被一个三段和一个五段的年轻棋手击败。　　　　（上）
