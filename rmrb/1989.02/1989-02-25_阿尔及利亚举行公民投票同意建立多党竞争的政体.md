Algeria holds referendum approving the establishment of a multi-party competitive system

Our reporter Lin Jiaoming reports from Cairo on February 24: The results of Algeria's referendum show that the majority of Algerians have agreed to the new constitution, ending the single-party rule that has been in place since the country's independence in 1962.

Algeria held a referendum on the new constitutional amendment draft two days ago. 73% of the citizens agreed to freely organize political parties outside the ruling party, the National Liberation Front, and to establish a democratic system with multi-party competition.

Algeria's drafting of the new constitution is a major decision made by President Chadli Bendjedid following the political reforms initiated after the October 1988 riots.

　　阿尔及利亚举行公民投票同意建立多党竞争的政体
    本报开罗２月２４日电  记者林皎明报道：阿尔及利亚公民投票结果表明，多数阿尔及利亚人同意新宪法，结束自１９６２年独立以来一党执政的政治体制。
    阿尔及利亚两天前就新宪法修正草案举行公民投票，７３％的公民同意在执政党阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线之外自由组织政党，建立多党竞争的民主政体。
    阿尔及利亚制订新宪法是沙德利总统在去年１０月骚乱事件后进行政治改革的重大抉择。
