Some rice merchants in Hunan began transporting rice out of the province in November 1988, involving nine cities and counties including Hengyang, Zhuzhou, Leiyang, Chengzhou, and Qidong. These areas had a good harvest last year. Due to the higher rice prices in Guangdong and Guangxi compared to Hunan, many merchants took advantage of the situation and transported rice to these provinces via the Jingguang, Xianggui, and Xiangqi railways, using more than 10 train services and over 20 stations along the line. Most of these merchants had neither passenger tickets nor cargo tickets. Relying on their numbers, they forcibly entered the stations and boarded the trains, causing disorder at the stations and on the trains, and overloading the vehicles. Incidents of fights and brawls between the merchants and passengers also occurred frequently. In December last year, just within the jurisdiction of the Changsha Railway Bureau, passenger trains were delayed more than 20 times due to merchants carrying rice on board. The damage to the floor springs, windows, and public facilities in some carriages was also severe.

According to a comrade from the Transportation Management Office of the Commercial Department's Grain Transportation Bureau, last autumn, the State Council stipulated: "Rice is to be purchased by the grain department, and other departments, units, and individuals are not allowed to engage in rice trading." The Commercial Department, the Ministry of Railways, and the Ministry of Communications also issued a joint notice to implement unified management of rice transportation. A responsible comrade from the Transportation Management Office of the Commercial Department's Grain Transportation Bureau said that the relevant regulations of the State Council on grain management should be strictly enforced, and speculators who transport rice should be severely cracked down upon. It is hoped that the local government of Hunan will organize the railway, industrial and commercial, grain, and public security departments to widely publicize and strengthen management in key areas to solve this problem.

A responsible person from the Passenger Transport Management Office of the Ministry of Railways told the reporter that the problem of some people using passenger trains to transport rice should be solved by the railway in conjunction with the local government through comprehensive management. Railway workers should first set an example by strictly adhering to the relevant regulations. A deputy minister of the Ministry of Railways once instructed that train attendants are strictly prohibited from carrying rice, let alone colluding with grain merchants to sell grain. If any train attendant is found to be involved in grain smuggling, they will be severely dealt with. It is understood that the Hunan Provincial People's Government issued an emergency notice in December last year, stipulating that passengers on trains and ships should not carry more than 20 kilograms of personal items. Those carrying more than 20 kilograms should handle the cargo consignment procedures; those carrying more than 20 kilograms of rice must have a transportation permit from the grain department to handle the consignment; it is strictly forbidden to forcibly carry rice on board beyond the regulations. Unlawful elements who transport grain for profit should be dealt with according to law.

Recently, relevant personnel of the Liuzhou Railway Bureau, in cooperation with the local government, conducted inspections on the 405th and 411th trains, intercepting more than 100 rice merchants and seizing three to four ten-thousand kilograms of rice each day. The phenomenon of rice merchants carrying rice on passenger trains within Hunan has been basically eliminated.

　　调查附记
    湖南一些米贩子外运大米是从１９８８年１１月开始的，涉及衡阳、株洲、耒阳、郴州、祁东等９个市县。这些地区去年粮食丰收，由于广东、广西米价高于湖南，这就吸引了许多米贩子通过京广、湘桂、湘黔铁路１０多个车次、沿线的２０多个车站贩运大米到两广出售。这些米贩子多数既无客票也无货票，依仗人多势众，强行进站上车，造成站、车秩序混乱，车辆超载。米贩子与旅客打架斗殴的事也时有发生。去年１２月，仅长沙铁路分局辖区的客车因米贩子带米乘车，就造成２０多次列车晚点，一些车厢的底座弹簧、车窗玻璃、车内公共用具损坏也极严重。
    据商业部粮食储运局运输管理处的同志介绍，去年秋天，国务院规定：“大米由粮食部门统一收购，其他部门、单位和个人不得经营”。商业部、铁道部和交通部也发出联合通知，对大米运输实行归口管理。商业部粮食储运局运输管理处负责同志表示，应严格执行国务院有关粮食管理的规定，对贩运大米的投机倒把者应严厉打击；希望湖南地方政府组织铁路、工商、粮食、公安等部门，在重点地区广泛宣传，加强管理，解决这一问题。
    铁道部运输局客运管理处负责人对记者说，对一些人利用客车贩运大米的问题，铁路要紧紧依靠地方政府，采取综合治理的办法来解决。铁路职工首先要模范遵守有关规定。铁道部一位副部长曾批示：乘务人员一律不准捎带大米，更不准与粮贩子勾结倒卖粮食。如发现乘务人员贩粮问题，将严肃处理。据了解，湖南省人民政府去年１２月下发了紧急通知，规定凡乘坐车、船的旅客，随身携带物品重量不准超过２０公斤，超过２０公斤的，应办理货物托运手续；其中携带大米２０公斤以上的，必须凭粮食部门的准运证才能办理托运；严禁超规定强行带米上车。对以贩运粮食为目的的不法分子，要依法予以打击。
    最近，柳州铁路局有关人员与地方政府配合，在４０５次、４１１次列车上连续进行检查，每天截获米贩子１００多个，大米三四万公斤。湖南境内现已基本上杜绝了米贩子携带大米乘坐客运列车的现象。
