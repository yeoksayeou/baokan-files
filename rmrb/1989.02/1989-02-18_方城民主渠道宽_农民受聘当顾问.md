Fangcheng County in Henan Province has hired 65 farmers as advisors, broadening democratic channels and promoting farmers' participation in policymaking. Over the past year, these farmer advisors have submitted 312 suggestions to the county, of which 183 have been adopted.

The practice of hiring farmer advisors in Fangcheng County began in the winter of 1987. Each township (town) selected 3 to 5 honest and outspoken farmers for this role. The county party secretary and county magistrate issued certificates of appointment. Farmer advisors can provide feedback on the implementation of higher-level policies, offer suggestions for the work of the party and government, and supervise party and government officials through written letters, phone calls, or face-to-face meetings. This approach has enhanced the democratic and scientific nature of the county's decision-making process, increased the enthusiasm of the masses for participating in policymaking, and strengthened the relationship between the party, government, and the people.

　　方城民主渠道宽
    农民受聘当顾问
    本报郑州电  据《河南日报》报道：河南省方城县委、县政府聘请６５位农民当顾问，拓宽了民主渠道，促进了农民参政议政。一年多来，农民顾问已经向县里提合理化建议３１２条，其中有１８３条被采纳。
    方城县聘请农民当顾问始于１９８７年冬。每个乡（镇）推选了３—５名公道正派，敢讲真话的农民当此大任，县委书记和县长授权颁发证书。农民顾问可采用写信、打电话、面谈等方式，对上级政策执行情况给予反馈，对党和政府工作提出意见，对党和国家工作人员进行监督。这样既提高了县委、县政府决策的民主化科学化程度，又提高了群众参政议政的积极性，使党政群关系更加密切起来。
