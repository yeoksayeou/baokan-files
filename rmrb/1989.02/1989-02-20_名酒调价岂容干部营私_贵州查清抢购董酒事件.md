The severe disciplinary violation of some party and government officials in Guizhou Province hoarding Dongjiu wine has been thoroughly investigated by the provincial disciplinary commission and supervision bureau over several months. The case has now been cleared and approved by the Central Disciplinary Commission for closure.

The investigation revealed that a total of 3,140 cases, amounting to 62,800 bottles, of Dongjiu wine were hoarded. This hoarding activity resulted in a loss of over 310,000 yuan in state economic revenue and had a highly negative political impact. A total of 118 units were involved in this cleanup, including 68 provincial, municipal, and military party and government agencies and public institutions, which purchased 1,263 cases of wine. A total of 164 individuals were implicated, including 78 party members, 13 at the county or bureau level, 33 at the section or district level, and 118 general staff.

The Guizhou Provincial Disciplinary Commission and Supervision Bureau have decided to handle this severe disciplinary violation of hoarding Dongjiu wine strictly according to party, administrative, and legal disciplines. Those involved in serious resale activities, such as Maotian County Light Industry Bureau Director Zhao Tianxian and Guizhou Provincial Economic Commission Enterprise Service Company employee Deng Jizhi, have been ordered by relevant units to receive party and administrative disciplinary actions. For units and individuals involved in hoarding, such as the Zunyi Regional Petroleum Company Sales Department's Ran Ruixiang, they have been ordered to submit written self-criticisms and have been given criticism and education. All hoarded Dongjiu wine that has not been processed has been returned, totaling 234 cases, and handed over to the commercial department for processing. For wine that has been processed, a total of over 250,000 yuan in price differences has been paid and handed over to the finance department.
