Yan Mingfu emphasized at the National Ethnic Affairs Commission Directors' Meeting the need to cultivate minority cadres and nurture a batch of leaders.

    The People's Daily, Beijing, February 20th – Reporter Yuan Jianda reports: "Cultivating tens of thousands of minority cadres and leaders among them is a fundamental strategy for advancing the cause of national unity and progress. We must approach the task of cultivating minority cadres with a strong sense of urgency and responsibility." These words were emphasized by Yan Mingfu, a member of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, at the National Ethnic Affairs Commission Directors' Meeting.

    He revealed that the Central United Front Work Department and the State Ethnic Affairs Commission plan to compile a list of outstanding party and non-party middle and young cadres and representatives within a year among the 55 minority nationalities, and to cultivate, recommend, and promote them in a planned manner.

    Yan Mingfu demanded that everyone remain highly vigilant against the destructive activities of splittist forces and engage in resolute struggle. On major issues concerning national unity, there can be no ambiguity.

    At the meeting, Yan Mingfu also shared his views on how ethnic work departments should regulate the economic environment, rectify economic order, and deepen comprehensive reforms.

    When discussing how all relevant departments should truly start from the reality of ethnic minority areas and accelerate the development of these areas, Yan Mingfu emphasized that ethnic minority regions should strengthen intellectual investment and development, improve ethnic education, and cultivate professionals in various fields.
