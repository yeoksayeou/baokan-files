In the United States today, the trend of implementing "employee stock ownership plans" (where employees purchase their company's stocks) is on the rise. An increasing number of enterprises are adopting this management approach, viewing it as a means to both enhance labor productivity and facilitate mergers or anti-merger strategies.

According to reports, there are currently 10 million employees in the U.S., or 1/4 of the country's corporate workforce, who own stocks in their respective companies. A decade ago, this number was only 3 million. Among the enterprises that have adopted employee stock ownership plans, there are 9,800 in total, with 1,500 of these having employees who own the majority of the company's stocks. There are numerous examples of employees becoming wealthy through this means. In a printing company in Wisconsin, employees with five years of service each own stocks worth $250,000, and the annual dividends are also substantial.

Some companies that have implemented "employee stock ownership plans" claim that linking employees' gains and losses directly to the company's performance helps to boost employee productivity and the company's efficiency. Additionally, promoting employee stock ownership is a powerful "weapon" for enterprises to engage in mergers or anti-merger strategies.

Since the 1980s, the trend of corporate mergers in the U.S. has been intensifying. Some companies, in order to achieve the goal of merging with other enterprises, encourage employees to purchase stocks, thereby reducing the need for loans to fund the merger. Conversely, some companies, to defend against mergers, sell the majority of their stocks to employees, as some states' anti-merger laws stipulate that to merge with a company, one must purchase 85% of its stocks.

How does the employee stock ownership plan benefit workers? There are differing opinions within the U.S. The government has consistently supported it and provided certain tax incentives to encourage its adoption. Some critics argue that while employees may benefit from purchasing company stocks, they also make sacrifices such as reduced wages. Despite these criticisms, the trend of employee stock ownership has spread to countries like Japan, Britain, and West Germany.

### 美国职工股份制方兴未艾  一石二鸟：既可提高生产率又能进行兼并或反兼并

　　美国职工股份制方兴未艾
    一石二鸟：既可提高生产率又能进行兼并或反兼并
    本报讯  在今日美国，实行“职工股份制”（即职工购买本公司股票）的热潮方兴未艾。越来越多的企业争相采用这种经营方式，把它视为既可提高劳动生产率又能进行兼并或反兼并的手段。
    据报道，美国现在有１０００万职工，即全美１／４的公司雇员拥有所在公司的股票，而１０年前只有３００万人。就采用职工股份制的企业来说，现有９８００家，其中１５００家职工拥有的股份在其全部股份中占居多数。职工因此而发迹的不乏其例。在威斯康星州的一家印刷公司，有五年工龄的职工平均每人拥有面值２５万美元的本公司股票，其年红利也相当可观。
    一些实行“职工股份制”的公司声称，把雇员的得失与公司的成败直接挂钩，有助于提高雇员的生产积极性和公司的生产效率；同时，推行职工股份制还是企业进行兼并或反兼并的有力“武器”。
    ８０年代以来，美国的企业兼并风潮愈演愈烈。一些公司为了达到兼并别的企业的目的，便鼓励职工购买股票，这样就可少借款用于兼并。而有的公司为了抵御兼并，也把多数股份卖给职工，因为有些州的反兼并法规定，欲兼并某一企业，须买下其８５％的股份。
    职工股份制对工人利弊如何？美国国内对此有不同的议论。政府一向为之开放绿灯，并以某种减税优惠给予鼓励。一些批评者则说，职工虽然可能因买下公司股票而受益，但另一方面也作出了被迫减少工资的牺牲。尽管如此，职工股份制之风已吹到了日本、英国和西德等国。
