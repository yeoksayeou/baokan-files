Xu Jiatun, Director of the Xinhua News Agency's Hong Kong Branch, said yesterday during a meeting with former French President Giscard d'Estaing that since the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration on the Hong Kong issue, especially since China implemented its reform and opening-up policy, the relationship between Hong Kong and the mainland has entered a new stage.

Xu revealed that according to statistics from Guangdong Province, the number of workers in Guangdong serving Hong Kong's manufacturing industry has reached over 4 million. This number is double that of a year ago and is far higher than Hong Kong's labor population of approximately 2.8 million. Currently, this trend is just beginning.

During the nearly one-hour meeting, Xu, at Giscard d'Estaing's request, discussed the relationship between Hong Kong and its neighboring provinces after 1997. He said that after 1997, Hong Kong will implement "one country, two systems," and the economic relationship between the two sides will become even closer. The mainland, in implementing reform and opening-up, will use Hong Kong as a bridge for external development. Hong Kong has become an important channel for the mainland to attract foreign investment and learn from foreign experiences. In recent years, a significant portion of the foreign investment China has attracted has come from Hong Kong, and many of Hong Kong's manufacturing plants have moved to the mainland. He said that the relationship between Hong Kong and the mainland is one of mutual assistance and benefit. In the future, as Hong Kong develops, it may become an important port for the provinces south of the Yangtze River.

However, Xu denied that Shenzhen and Hong Kong will be merged after 1997. He believes that this rumor is incorrect.

When Giscard d'Estaing asked about the possibility of people from the mainland becoming capitalists after 1997, Xu said that after 1997, Hong Kong will maintain its capitalist system, which is primarily private ownership, while the mainland is primarily public ownership. It is possible for people from the mainland to become capitalists in Hong Kong. We do not worry about this issue.

　　许家屯会见法国前总统德斯坦时说    
    香港和内地关系日益发展   
    广东为港制造工业服务的工人已达四百多万
    本报香港２月１４日电  新华社香港分社社长许家屯昨天在会见法国前总统德斯坦时说，自１９８４年中英关于香港问题的联合声明签署以来，特别是中国实行改革开放政策后，香港和内地关系的发展进入了一个崭新的阶段。
    许家屯透露，据广东省的统计，该省为香港制造工业服务的工人数目已达４００多万。这个数字比一年前增加了一倍，同时，这个数字也远高于全港大约２８０万的劳动人口。目前，这种发展趋势还刚刚开始。
    在近一个小时的会见中，许家屯应德斯坦的要求谈到了１９９７年后，香港同大陆邻近省份的关系问题。他说，１９９７年后，香港将实行“一国两制”，双方在经济上的关系将会变得更加密切。内地为实行改革开放，把香港作为对外发展的桥梁，香港已成内地吸收外资、吸取外国经验的重要渠道。近几年来，中国吸收的外资，有相当多的部分来自香港，香港的许多制造业工厂已转入内地。他说，香港同内地的关系是互助互利的关系，今后随着香港的发展，它很可能成为长江以南各省的重要港口之一。
    但是，许家屯否认１９９７年后深圳和香港将划为一体。他认为这种传说是不正确的。
    当德斯坦问到１９９７年以后，从大陆来的人会不会成为资本家的问题时，许家屯说，１９９７年后，香港将保持资本主义制度，是以私有制为主体的，而内地是以公有制为主体的，内地到香港来的人变成资本家，这是可能的。我们并不担心这一问题。
