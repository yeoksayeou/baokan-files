Sleep researchers classify individuals who sleep less than 6 hours as "sleep-deficient type," while those who sleep more than 9 hours are termed "oversleeping type." After conducting psychological tests on these two types of individuals, it was found that most of the sleep-deficient type have extroverted personalities and are good at practical work. In contrast, most of the oversleeping type have introverted personalities and are adept at theoretical thinking.

Statistics show that a person typically turns over 23 to 30 times each night. The primary reason for turning over is to improve blood circulation in the compressed areas during sleep. The frequency of turning over is related to the temperature and humidity during sleep; if the temperature and humidity are too high, the frequency of turning over will increase, which can affect sleep quality.

According to scientific research, the human sleep process can be divided into four stages. The first and second stages are light sleep, while the third and fourth stages are deep sleep. Individuals with introverted personalities tend to have longer light sleep durations and shorter deep sleep durations, thus requiring relatively more sleep time. Conversely, extroverted individuals have shorter light sleep durations and spend more time in deep sleep, resulting in shorter overall sleep durations.

　　睡眠与性格
    睡眠学家将睡眠不足６小时的人称为“睡眠不足型”，而睡眠时间超过９小时的人称为“睡眠过多型”。对这两种类型的人进行心理测验后，发现大多数睡眠不足型的人性格属于外向型，善于从事实际工作；相反，大多数睡眠过多型的人的性格属于内向型，善于理论思维。
    据统计，一个人每天晚上平均要翻身２３—３０次，翻身的主要原因是，改善在睡眠中受压部位的血液流动状况。翻身的次数多少，与睡眠时温度与湿度有关，温度和湿度过高，翻身的次数就会增多。翻身次数过多会影响睡眠。
    根据科学家的研究，人的睡眠过程可分为四个阶段，第一二阶段为浅睡状态，第三四阶段为深睡状态。具有内向性格的人，浅睡时间较长，而深睡时间较短。因此睡眠时间相对来说要求长一些。相反，性格外向型的人，浅睡时间较短，大都处于深睡状态。因此，他们的睡眠时间就短得多。
