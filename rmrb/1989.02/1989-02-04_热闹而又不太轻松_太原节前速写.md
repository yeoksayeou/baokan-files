Title: Bustling but Not Completely Relaxed – A Sketch of Taiyuan Before the Spring Festival

The Spring Festival of 1989 seems to be somewhat extraordinary.

Ensuring that the people have a joyful Spring Festival has become a slogan for this year. In the display windows and counters of state-owned shops in Taiyuan, there are slogans that read, "Control prices and benefit the people." Over the past four months of economic rectification and tightening, the Spring Festival, which people care about the most, has become a benchmark for government work and national psychology.

On the eve of the New Year, the Zhao family, engineers at Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company, were watching television. The host said with a smile, "If you ask what's different about this Spring Festival compared to previous years, it's that the prices are too high. Chinese people's Spring Festival is mainly reflected in food, and precisely the prices of foodstuffs are unbearable. The government's measures to control prices are indeed popular." Their college-student son chimed in, "Controlling prices is not the fundamental solution. The idea of 'benefiting the people' is also worth discussing. Doing business means making money. If you don't make money, where's the motivation? If you give away profits, what kind of commodity economy is it?" His words were immediately met with opposition from the whole family. The debate, accompanied by the television sound and the aroma of meat wafting from the kitchen, spread through the winter night...

At the bus stop, a newlywed couple said, "We haven't really felt the impact of price increases." "Maybe we will gradually feel it," the husband said. "Then we'll just earn more money." They had bought a color TV, a refrigerator, and their new room was covered with floor tiles, spending over ten thousand yuan in total. The groom said, "My parents can feel the changes in prices the most."

More than ten days before the New Year, this city of 2 million people had already felt the "radiation" of the festival. The population density in major streets and shops increased significantly. The sales of famous cigarettes and liquor continued to rise. Long queues for purchasing goods with coupons could be seen everywhere. A large number of farmers flocked into the city to buy clothes. Occasionally, delivery trucks with the slogan "I work hard for the convenience of thousands of people" would pass by. Mayor Wan Liangshi of Taiyuan said, "Some problems cannot be solved in a short time, and some cannot be solved by administrative means. Currently, what we can do is to think more carefully and meticulously for the citizens. We need to tell the truth, be honest with the people, and let them feel at ease. China's affairs are not the responsibility of one person; we need everyone to work together." He said that during the Spring Festival, all cadres in the city's financial and commercial system would go to the counters, just like during the New Year, "to listen to the people's complaints face to face."

"Cursing" seems to be a way for some people to express their mood. "Prices" have become the medium of people's interactions. Those in line to buy things often start talking about this topic. Interestingly, those buying five roasted chickens and those buying one roasted chicken are expressing the same complaints.

Careful observers might have noticed that although the economic environment has improved somewhat after the rectification, there are still people selling scarce commodities in front of shops and starting to sell tickets and coupons; there are still gift-giving cars coming in and out of government offices; various units still distribute goods as "welfare"; and there are still frequent power outages and water shortages...

In a few days, the Chinese people will enter their traditional New Year. Due to the restriction on setting off firecrackers, the intense scene of "firecrackers ringing out the old year" may be less vivid. "Every year is hard to pass, but every year passes well." Someone wrote such a couplet.

"On the first day of the New Year, if the gas doesn't stop, it's fine."

"During the cultural performance, there shouldn't be a power outage."

A young man who went to study in the United States at the end of last year wrote in a recent letter to his friend: After stepping onto American soil, he finally understood what it means to be Chinese. He doesn't know the final situation of the domestic market supply for this Spring Festival. But he said, "We Chinese people want to live truly prosperous lives; we have to work hard for a few more years."

　　热闹而又不太轻松
　　——太原节前速写
    本报记者　阎晓明
    １９８９年春节似乎不太平凡。
    让人民高高兴兴过好年，已成今年春节的一个口号。太原国营商店的橱窗和柜台上，贴着“平抑物价，让利于民”标语。治理整顿四个月来，人们最看重的春节成了政府工作和国民心理的一柄标杆。
    临近年关的晚上，太原钢铁公司赵工程师全家正在看电视。男主人笑着说：“要说今年春节与往年有什么不同，那就是物价太贵了。中国人过年主要体现在饮食上，恰恰副食品的价格让人受不了，政府采取措施限制物价还是得人心的。”正读大学的儿子从旁插话：“平抑物价不是解决问题的根本办法。让利于民这个提法也值得探讨。经商就要赚钱，不挣钱能有什么积极性？让了利，还叫什么商品经济？”他的话骤然遭到全家的反对。争论伴随着电视音响和厨房里飘来的肉香，在冬夜里弥漫……
    公共汽车站，一对新婚小夫妻说：“对于物价我们还没有感到什么。”“也许以后慢慢会感觉到。”丈夫说：“那就多挣钱吧。”他们有了彩电、冰箱，新房还铺了地板膜，前后花掉一万多元。新郎讲：“我爸我妈最能感到物价的变化。”
    十多天前，太原这座２００万人口的城市就已感受到节日的“辐射”。主要街道和商店里，人口密度激增。名烟名酒的销售额不断上升。持券购物的长队随处可见。大量农民涌入城市购置服装。不时有贴着“辛苦我一个，方便千万人”标语的送货车从街头驶过。太原市市长万良适说：“有些问题不是一时半会儿能解决的，有些更不能靠行政手段来解决。眼下，我们能做的，就是尽量为市民想得周到些、细致些。要讲实话，向老百姓交底，让人顺气，中国的事不是哪一个人的，需要大家同舟共济。”他说，春节期间，全市财贸系统的干部都要去站柜台，像元旦时一样，“当面听听老百姓的牢骚”。
    “骂娘”似乎是一些人表述心境的方式。“物价”成了人们交往的媒介，排队买东西的人们，打开话匣子往往不离这个主题。有趣的是，一次买五只烧鸡的和买一只烧鸡的发着同样的牢骚。
    细心人或许已经注意到，虽然整顿后经济环境有所改观，但依然有人在商店前倒卖紧俏商品，并开始倒卖票证；依然有送礼的汽车在机关出出进进；各单位依然用“福利”发放物品；还有，依旧经常停电、停水……
    几天后，中国人将迈进自己传统的新年。由于限制燃放烟花爆竹，“爆竹声中一岁除”的浓烈情景可能要淡些。“年年难过年年过，年年过得还不错”。有人写了这么一幅对联。
    “大年初一下饺子时不停煤气就行了。”
    “文艺晚会时可别停电。”
    一位去年末去美国留学的青年，在最近给他朋友的信中说：踏上美国的土地后，才明白什么叫中国人。他不知道今年春节国内市场供应的最终情况。但他说，我们中国人要想过真正富裕的日子非得再苦干几年不可。
