Scientists at the Superconductivity Research Center of the University of Houston have recently succeeded in conducting four times the highest recorded current using a strip of iridium-barium-copper oxide superconducting material. This is the latest announcement by Professor Zhu Jingwu of the University of Houston. He said that the critical current they tested was over 60,000 amperes per square centimeter, marking a major breakthrough in the research towards the practical application of superconductors.

One of the key issues in the practical application of superconducting materials is the ability to conduct large currents, ideally exceeding 10,000 amperes per square centimeter.

Zhu Jingwu pointed out, "The sample can also conduct the same amount of current in a magnetic field."

He said that the next challenge is to manufacture the sample into practical wire. Once the wire can conduct the same current, it can be applied to engines, generators, magnets, or power transmission systems.

This new record was jointly achieved by Zhu Jingwu's team, including doctoral student Gao Li, visiting scholar from mainland China Sun Keyi, mechanical engineering professor Kamal Salam, and Indian doctoral student Venkatar.

From Tokyo, our reporter Yu Qing reports: So far, superconductors have conducted electricity through the movement of holes. The newly discovered superconductor conducts electricity through the movement of electrons. This breakthrough was made by a team led by Associate Professor Uchida Shinichi of the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Tokyo. The findings were first published in the January 26 issue of the British journal *Nature*.

　　美超导研究又有突破
　　日本发现新超导物质
    本报纽约２月８日电  记者刘开宸报道：美国休斯顿大学超导研究中心的科学家们最近以铱钡铜氧化物条状超导材料，成功地传导４倍于过去最高纪录的电流强度。
    这是休斯顿大学华裔教授朱经武最近宣布的。他说，他们试验通过的临界电流为每平方厘米６万安培以上，是超导体迈向应用的研究工作方面一项重大突破。
    超导材料的实用化课题之一是要能通过大电流，至少需超过每平方厘米１万安培。
    朱经武指出，“样品在磁场下，也可传导同样大的电流”。
    他说，下一步有待克服的障碍是如何将样品制成具有实用性的线材，一旦线材能够传导相同的电流，即可应用于发动机、发电机、磁铁或电力传送系统等方面。
    这项新纪录是由朱经武领导的超导研究中心博士研究生高理、中国（大陆）访问学者孙克义、机械工程教授卡马尔·萨拉姆博士、印裔研究生文卡特等人共同创造的。
    本报东京电　记者于青报道：迄今的超导体是通过空穴移动产生电流。新发现的超导体是通过电子移动产生电流。这一突破性的成果是由东京大学工学部内田慎一副教授为首的小组发现的。最初发表在１月２６日出版的英国《自然》杂志上。
