On February 15th, the first batch of over 300 commercial housing units in Beijing began accepting registrations for sale. Before the trading hall even opened, many people were already waiting outside (see left image). The public sale of commercial housing brings hope to those facing housing difficulties. However, many people are deterred by the prices: the standard selling prices for commercial housing are 1,600, 1,700, and 1,900 yuan per square meter of built-up area. At these prices, buying a house would cost between four to five hundred thousand yuan for a smaller unit and up to one to two million yuan for a larger one. An engineer commented, "With just our salaries, there's no way we can afford it. The price is just too high!"

On this day, over a thousand people came to the trading hall, with 255 people registering. Some people registered first and will decide later. Others are worried that even after registering, they might not be able to buy a house. When the topic of buying a house comes up, some people think of individual business owners. For some reason, from the introductions, individual business owners seem to be few and far between. An elderly woman inquired about the details of buying a house at the registration counter.

    北京卖新房第一天
    2月15日，北京市首批公开出售的300多套商品房开始登记。交易所门未开，早已有许多人等候（见左图）。公开出售商品房为住房困难户带来希望。但不少人望价生畏：商品房标准售价分别为每平方米建筑面积1600、1700、1900元。按此售价，买一套房子，少的要四五万元，多的要一二十万元。一位工程师说：“靠挣的一点工资是绝对买不起的。这价儿，真够呛！”这一天来交易所的有上千人，登记者255人。有人是先登了记再说。有人担心办了登记手续，而最后却买不到房。一提买房，有人就想到个体户，不知为什么，从介绍信上看，个体户很少。一位老大娘在购房登记处询问有关买房事宜。
