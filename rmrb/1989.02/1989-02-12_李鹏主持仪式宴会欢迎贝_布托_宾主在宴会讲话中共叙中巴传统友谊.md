Li Peng Hosts Ceremonial Banquet to Welcome Benazir Bhutto

Guests and Hosts Reminisce About Traditional Sino-Pakistani Friendship at Banquet

BEIJING, Feb. 11 (Xinhua) — Premier Li Peng hosted a ceremonial banquet at the Great Hall of the People this evening to welcome Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.

Benazir Bhutto arrived in Beijing this afternoon at the invitation of Premier Li Peng, beginning her official friendly visit to China.

Chinese officials attending the welcoming ceremony included Vice Premier Wu Xueqian, Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, and the head of the Chinese delegation, Minister of Textile Industry Wu Wenying.

Pakistani officials attending the ceremony included Benazir Bhutto's husband, Asif Ali Zardari, and Pakistani Foreign Minister Yaqub Khan.

After the welcoming ceremony, Li Peng met briefly with the Pakistani guests.

BEIJING, Feb. 11 (Xinhua) — Premier Li Peng hosted a grand banquet at the Great Hall of the People this evening to warmly welcome Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.

In his speech at the banquet, Li Peng said, "Shortly after you assumed the premiership, you chose to visit China first. This fully demonstrates your and your government's and people's high regard for Sino-Pakistani relations and deep affection for the Chinese people. Li Peng pointed out that for many years, Pakistan has firmly supported the just struggle of the Afghan people, provided generous humanitarian aid to three million Afghan refugees, and made unremitting efforts and important contributions to seeking a comprehensive political solution to the Afghan issue. We highly appreciate this. Like other countries in the world, China and Pakistan hope that various political forces in Afghanistan can determine their own future through peaceful negotiations without external interference, and establish as soon as possible a broad-based united government that can be accepted by all parties, so that Afghanistan's independence, peace, neutrality, and non-aligned status can be restored early."

Li Peng highly praised Pakistan's active efforts in improving and strengthening relations with neighboring countries and promoting regional cooperation.

He reiterated that in Pakistan's just cause of safeguarding national independence and sovereignty, striving for national development, and promoting world peace, the Chinese government and people will always be a reliable friend of the Pakistani people.

In her speech at the banquet, Benazir Bhutto said, "This visit fulfills our long-cherished wish to reunite with our Chinese friends. It is like returning to a hometown after many years of separation, which touches our hearts. Benazir Bhutto recalled the traditional friendship between Pakistan and China and the warm hospitality she received from Premier Zhou Enlai during her visit to China in 1972.

Benazir Bhutto said, "Pakistan firmly believes that the Indian Ocean should not become an uncontrolled stage for militarization. Major powers, as well as coastal and inland countries, must establish a system to limit the scale of militarization in this region. Balance and moderate behavior are the only way to prevent an expensive arms race."

Benazir Bhutto pointed out, "Regarding the prospect of improving Sino-Soviet relations with the gradual removal of three major obstacles, Pakistan welcomes this. We believe that the easing of tensions and the resolution of outstanding issues between these two neighboring countries will contribute to peace and stability in our region. We are also pleased to see that the prospects for Sino-Indian friendly relations have improved since the recent visit of the Indian Prime Minister to China."

Benazir Bhutto concluded, "China supports the idea of establishing a new international political order based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and Pakistan is particularly interested in this support. She pledged to do her utmost to promote the traditional friendship between Pakistan and China."

Li Peng's wife, Zhu Lin, attended the banquet. Also present were Wu Xueqian, Huang Zhen, Saifuddin Azizi, Chen Muxia, Simayi Aymeti, Luo Gan, Qian Qichen, Ding Henggao, Lin Zongtang, Wu Wenying, and other relevant officials.

Asif Ali Zardari and Pakistani Foreign Minister Yaqub Khan also attended the banquet.

    宾主在宴会讲话中共叙中巴传统友谊
    本报北京２月１１日讯  记者温宪报道：李鹏总理今晚六时在人民大会堂中央大厅主持仪式，欢迎巴基斯坦总理贝娜齐尔·布托。
    贝·布托总理是应李鹏总理邀请，于今天下午抵达北京开始对我国进行正式友好访问的。
    出席欢迎仪式的中方人士还有国务院副总理吴学谦，外交部长钱其琛，我国陪同团团长、纺织工业部部长吴文英等。
    贝·布托总理的丈夫阿西夫·阿里·扎尔达里先生和巴基斯坦外交部长雅各布·汗等巴方人士也出席了欢迎仪式。
    欢迎仪式后，李鹏礼节性地会见了巴基斯坦贵宾。
    本报北京２月１１日讯　记者温宪报道：国务院总理李鹏今晚在人民大会堂举行盛大宴会，热烈欢迎巴基斯坦总理贝娜齐尔·布托。
    李鹏总理在宴会讲话中说，阁下就任总理后不久即首先出访我国，这充分体现了阁下、贵国政府和人民对中巴关系的高度重视和对中国人民的深情厚谊。李鹏指出，多年来，巴基斯坦坚决支持阿富汗人民的正义斗争，为三百万阿富汗难民提供了慷慨的人道主义援助，并为寻求阿富汗问题的全面政治解决作出了不懈的努力和重要的贡献。对此我们表示高度赞赏。中巴两国和世界上其它国家一样，希望阿富汗各种政治力量在没有外来干涉的情况下通过和平协商决定自己的未来，尽早建立一个基础广泛、能为各方接受的联合政府，使阿富汗的独立、和平、中立和不结盟地位早日得到恢复。
    李鹏高度评价巴基斯坦在改善和加强同邻国的关系及促进区域合作方面所作的积极努力。
    他重申，在巴基斯坦维护国家独立、主权，争取国家发展和促进世界和平的正义事业中，中国政府和人民将永远是巴基斯坦人民可以信赖的朋友。
    贝·布托总理在宴会讲话时说，此次访问使我们夙愿得偿，同中国朋友重聚一堂。这犹如回到离别多年的家乡，令人为之动情。贝·布托回顾了巴中传统友谊和１９７２年她访问中国时周恩来总理对她的盛情款待。
    贝·布托说，巴基斯坦坚持认为，印度洋不应成为不加控制的军事化的舞台。大国以及沿岸和内陆国家必须制定一种制度来限制本地区军事化的规模。均势与适度行为是防止一场耗资巨大的军备竞赛的唯一出路。
    贝·布托指出，对于随着逐步消除三大障碍，中苏关系改善的前景，巴基斯坦表示欢迎。我们认为，这两个邻邦缓和紧张状态，解决彼此间悬而未决的问题将有助于我们这一地区的和平与稳定。我们还感到高兴的是，印度总理最近访问中国后，中印友好关系的前景得到了改善。
    贝·布托最后说，中国支持关于建立以和平共处五项原则为基础的国际政治新秩序的思想，巴基斯坦对这一支持尤为感兴趣。她保证将竭尽全力促进巴中两国之间的传统友谊。
    李鹏总理的夫人朱琳出席了宴会。出席宴会作陪的还有吴学谦、黄镇、赛福鼎·艾则孜、陈慕华、司马义·艾买提、罗干、钱其琛、丁衡高、林宗棠、吴文英等有关方面负责人。
