The public security organs at various levels in the Shijiazhuang region of Hebei Province have taken measures to crack down on theft and sabotage of power facilities. So far, 244 cases of theft of power facilities have been solved, 16 gangs have been apprehended, 123 criminals have been arrested, and 247,565 meters of power lines, 14 transformers, 9 electric motors, and some agricultural power facilities such as submersible pumps and diesel generators have been recovered. A total of 37 ringleaders have been dealt with according to law.

Last year, various counties and cities in the Shijiazhuang region experienced cases of theft of power facilities. Especially after the winter, theft activities became rampant, affecting winter irrigation of wheat and people's daily electricity use. To safeguard the interests of the people and ensure agricultural production, public security departments at all levels in the region have made cracking down on crimes of sabotaging power facilities a key task.

Each county and city has established over 470 patrols composed of public security, security maintenance, and militia personnel. These patrols have been set up along major roads and key areas where criminals might operate, and checkpoints have been established. At the same time, the campaign has combined direct strikes with the cleanup of channels for criminals to sell stolen goods. A thorough investigation has been conducted of all individual and joint venture scrap metal collection points and aluminum product factories and foundries in the region, leading to the solving of over 30 theft cases. This has effectively struck at the "one-stop" criminal activities of theft and selling stolen goods.

　　石家庄地区打击破坏电力设施犯罪活动
    本报讯  河北省石家庄地区各级政法机关，采取措施打击盗窃破坏电力设施的犯罪活动。目前，已破获盗窃电力设施案件２４４起，抓获团伙１６个，逮捕犯罪分子１２３名，追缴电力线２４７５６５米，变压器１４台，电动机９部及部分潜水泵、柴油发电机等农用电力设施，依法处理了37名为首的犯罪分子。
    去年，石家庄地区各县市相继发生电力设施被盗案件，特别是入冬后，盗窃活动更为猖獗，影响了小麦冬灌和人民生活用电。为维护群众利益，保证农业生产，全区各级政法公安部门，把打击破坏电力设施的犯罪活动当做一项重要工作来抓。
    各县市成立了４７０多个由公安、治保和民兵组成的巡逻队，在主要公路和犯罪分子可能涉足的重点区域巡逻设卡，同时，还把正面打击与整顿罪犯销赃渠道结合起来，普遍对全区个体、联营废旧金属收购点和铝制品厂、铸造厂进行了清查，从中查破盗窃案件３０多起，有效地打击了盗窃和销赃“一条龙”进行的犯罪活动。
