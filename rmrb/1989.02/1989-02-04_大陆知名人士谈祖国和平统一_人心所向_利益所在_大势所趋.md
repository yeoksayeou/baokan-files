The Chinese have an old saying: "Every time a festival comes around, one thinks more of one's relatives." The Spring Festival is just around the corner, and mainland people are even more nostalgic for their relatives across the strait. People from all walks of life are more concerned about the future of the Chinese nation and the reunification of the motherland. Some prominent figures in the capital, either by participating in symposiums or accepting interviews, are thinking of their relatives and old friends in Taiwan, hoping for the early reunification of the motherland.

As one of the pioneers of rocket and aerospace engineering in the world, China's renowned mechanician Qian Weichang has frequently visited the United States, Canada, Hong Kong, and Macau in recent years, making contact with and befriending many old colleagues and new friends in Taiwan. He said, "I deeply feel that our sentiments are connected. We not only have a common language in scientific endeavors, but more importantly, we have a shared desire to promote the splendid culture of the Chinese nation and achieve the reunification of the motherland." He pointed out that reunification is highly beneficial for the prosperity of both sides' economies and cultures. At the same time, the unification and revitalization of the Chinese nation will have an important impact on the international community in the 21st century.

Lin Liwen, president of the All-China Federation of Taiwan Compatriots, told reporters that in recent years, more and more people in Taiwan have been concerned about Taiwan's future and national reunification, and the forces advocating peaceful reunification are growing. They propose that cross-strait relations should "move from open visits to 'three links,' and then from national integration to state reunification." The facts show that in today's rapidly developing cross-strait relations, separatism is unpopular, and advocating "Taiwan independence" will have no future.

The veteran former high-ranking Nationalist general Hou Jingru, reflecting on the past, was deeply moved. In his youth, he was filled with patriotic thoughts and resolutely took up arms, becoming a student of the first class of the Whampoa Military Academy. Later, he served as a platoon leader, company commander, division commander, corps commander, and commander-in-chief in the Nationalist army. He emphasized that today, China is not yet unified, and Taiwan is still isolated at sea. We must regard the cause of peaceful reunification as a historical mission of the Chinese nation. In 1984, the then 70-year-old Hou Jingru and his old classmates from Whampoa in the United States, Li Moran, Song Xirui, and Cai Wenji, jointly issued the "Declaration of the Preparatory Committee for the Promotion of China's Reunification by Whampoa Alumni and Their Families," calling on Whampoa alumni at home and abroad to unite and actively participate in the movement to promote China's reunification. The now 87-year-old Hou Jingru took up the post of president of the China Council for the Promotion of Peaceful National Reunification three months ago and continues to devote himself to the cause of China's peaceful reunification.

Sun Yueqi, an old expert who has spent more than half a century in industrial and mining economic management, believes that the economies of the mainland and Taiwan are both important components of the Chinese nation's economy, each with its strengths, and there are many benefits to mutual cooperation. He said that in recent years, cross-strait economic exchanges have begun, which is a welcome phenomenon. Economic cooperation and mutual assistance between the two sides of the strait is an inevitable trend, and it will have a great promoting effect on the economic development of both sides. He believes that the Chinese nation must take the road of economic mutual assistance and complementarity to become prosperous and strong.

Sun Xiaocun, chairman of the Central Advisory Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association, believes that it is better to reunify early than late. The mainland has rich resources and a vast market, while Taiwan has relatively advanced technology and substantial funds. Why can't we share our strengths and work together? He suggests that the two sides first normalize trade exchanges. He said, "Within one country, trade exchanges, why bother to go through others, increasing costs, and letting the benefits flow out?"

Rong Yiren, an internationally renowned entrepreneur and chairman of the China International Trust and Investment Corporation, said that expanding direct trade has become an urgent demand of business and industrial circles on both sides. He hopes that business friends from Taiwan can sit down with their counterparts on the mainland as soon as possible to exchange views on matters of common interest and increase mutual understanding.

Rong Yiren finally hopes that the business communities on both sides of the strait can cooperate with each other, invest in factories, exchange technologies, develop trade, and work together to develop the economy of the Chinese nation.

"China is the country of all Chinese people. National revitalization and state reunification are matters of common concern to all Chinese people. The trend is irresistible." Program Si Yuan, president of the China Council for the Promotion of Peaceful National Reunification, said that we should work hard to promote exchanges between the people of the two sides in economics, technology, education, academia, culture, arts, sports, and other fields, to increase common understanding, and to promote the situation in the strait towards peaceful reunification.

Zhu Xuefan, chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, said that on the issue of reunification, the authorities in Taiwan still have doubts. He urged the Kuomintang authorities to inherit the will of Dr. Sun Yat-sen to reunify the motherland and revitalize China, to prioritize national interests, and to accept the suggestions of the Communist Party of China to contact and negotiate with each other as soon as possible without any preconditions.

Huang Wei, 85, a member of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, criticized the authorities in Taiwan for insisting on an anti-communist and anti-negotiation stance in his speech. He pointed out: The authorities in Taiwan attempt to maintain a long-term divided situation, which not only goes against the interests of the nation and the people, but also is not conducive to the stability and development of Taiwan.

Cai Zimin, chairman of the Standing Committee of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, called on his fellow countrymen in Taiwan to actively contribute to national reconciliation and the reunification of the motherland.

　　大陆知名人士谈祖国和平统一
　　人心所向　利益所在　大势所趋
    本报讯  据新华社记者端木来娣、李择红报道：中国有句古话：“每逢佳节倍思亲”。新春佳节转瞬将临，大陆人民更加怀念隔海相望的台湾同胞，各界人士更为关注中华民族的前途和祖国的统一。首都一些知名人士，或参加座谈会，或接受记者采访，遥思台湾亲朋故旧，冀望祖国早日统一。
    身为世界火箭、宇航工程开拓者之一的我国著名的力学家钱伟长，近几年经常到美国、加拿大、香港、澳门等地访问，接触和结识了许多在台湾的老同事和新朋友。他说，我深切地感到，我们之间的感情是相通的。我们不仅在科学事业中有共同语言，更重要的是在弘扬中华民族灿烂的文化和实现祖国统一方面有共同的意愿。他指出，统一对两岸经济、文化的繁荣都有极大好处。同时，中华民族的统一与振兴，对２１世纪的国际社会也将产生重要的影响。
    全国台联会会长林丽韫告诉记者，近年来台湾岛内关心台湾前途和国家统一的人愈来愈多，主张和平统一的力量在增长。他们提出海峡两岸关系应“由开放探亲走向‘三通’，进而由民族整合迈向国家统一”。事实表明，在两岸关系迅速发展的今天，分离主义不得人心，主张“台独”是不会有出路和前途的。
    历经沧桑的原国民党高级将领侯镜如抚今追昔，感慨万千。他青年时代抱着爱国救国思想，毅然投笔从戎，当了黄埔军校第一期学生。以后在国民党军队中任排长、连长、师长、军长、司令员等职。他强调，今天，中国尚未统一，台湾仍孤悬海外。我们要把和平统一事业作为中华民族的历史使命来干。１９８４年，年逾古稀的侯镜如和旅美的黄埔老校友李默庵、宋希濂、蔡文治联合发表了《黄埔军校同学及其家属促进中国统一筹备委员会宣言》，呼吁海内外黄埔同学团结起来，奋发参加促进中国统一运动。现已８７岁高龄的侯镜如，于三个月前又出任中国和平统一促进会会长，继续致力于中国和平统一事业。
    大半世纪都在从事工矿企业经济管理的老专家孙越崎认为，大陆经济、台湾经济，都是中华民族经济的重要组成部分，在几十年的发展中，各有所长，互相合作有许多好处。他说，近几年来，海峡两岸已经开始了经济交流，这是一个可喜的现象。海峡两岸经济上的合作和互助是必然趋势，对两岸各自经济的发展都有极大的推动作用。他认为，中华民族要富强，就必须走这条经济互助互补道路。
    中国民主建国会中央咨议委员会主任孙晓村认为，早统一要比晚统一好。大陆有丰富的资源和广阔的市场，台湾有比较先进的技术和雄厚的资金，我们为什么不能互通有无，携手共进呢？他建议两岸先实现贸易往来正常化。他说，一国之内，贸易往来，何必假手他人，增加成本，肥水外流？
    国际知名的企业家、中国国际信托投资公司董事长荣毅仁表示，扩大直接贸易已成为两岸工商企业界人士的迫切要求。他期待台湾工商界朋友能够尽早同大陆工商界同仁坐到一起来，就我们共同感兴趣的事情交换意见，增进相互了解。
    荣毅仁最后希望海峡两岸的工商界能相互合作，投资设厂，交流技术，开展贸易，共同为发展中华民族经济尽心尽力。
    “中国是所有中国人的国家，民族振兴，国家统一，是所有中国人共同关心的大事。大势所趋，谁也阻挡不住。”中国和平统一促进会会长程思远说，我们要努力促进两岸人民之间经贸、科技、教育、学术、文化、艺术、体育等各种交流，以增进共同的认识，促使海峡形势向和平统一方向迈进。
    民革中央主席朱学范说，在统一问题上，台湾当局至今仍心存疑虑。他敦促国民党当局继承孙中山先生统一祖国、振兴中华的遗愿，以民族利益为重，接受中国共产党的建议，在没有任何先决条件下，双方及早进行接触、谈判。
    现年８５岁的全国政协常委黄维在谈话中批评台湾当局坚持反共拒和的立场。他指出：台湾当局企图维持长期分裂的局面，这既有违国家民族利益，更不利于台湾的安定和发展。
    台盟中央主席团主席蔡子民呼吁台湾家乡的父老兄弟姐妹，积极为民族和解、祖国统一贡献力量。
