The People's Daily learned from the State Education Commission that in 1988, the total amount of funds raised and donated by the public for education nationwide reached 2.5 billion yuan, an increase of nearly 900 million yuan compared to 1.624 billion yuan in 1987.

A notable feature of the public's fundraising and donations for education in 1988 was that some provinces and autonomous regions, which were not very economically developed and had previously raised relatively small amounts, saw a significant increase in the amount of funds raised for education. For example, provinces and autonomous regions such as Henan, Hebei, Shaanxi, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Guangxi saw their fundraising amounts increase by several times compared to 1987, with each raising over 100 million yuan.

The funds raised were mainly used to renovate dilapidated primary and secondary school buildings and improve school conditions. For instance, the Henan Provincial Government used funds raised by the public, education surcharges, and earnings from work-study programs to renovate 2.6 million square meters of dilapidated buildings, reducing the proportion of dilapidated school buildings from 5.4% at the beginning of the year to 1.37%. Additionally, 2.4 million square meters of new school buildings were constructed, 800,000 sets of student desks and chairs were added, 2 million books and other materials were increased, and 1.5 million teaching instruments were added. In Hebei Province, a total of 1.905 million square meters of school buildings were constructed, and 64 counties (cities) eliminated dangerous school buildings at the beginning of the year. The school conditions in some counties (cities) have been significantly improved.

　　国人关心支持教育　去年集资捐资２５亿
    本报北京２月２１日讯  记者从国家教委获悉：１９８８年全国群众集资、捐资办学款达２５亿元，较１９８７年的１６．２４亿元，增加近９亿元。
    １９８８年群众集资、捐资办学的一个显著特点是，一些经济不很发达、原先集资步伐较小的省份，群众集资办学的数额有了大幅度的增加。如河南、河北、陕西、江西、安徽、广西等省、自治区１９８８年集资数较１９８７年有了成倍、成几倍的增加，集资款额都在亿元以上。
    集资所得主要用于改造中小学危房，改善学校办学条件。如河南省人民政府利用群众集资和教育费附加、勤工俭学收益，共计改造危房２６０多万平方米，使中小学危房比重由年初的５．４％下降为１．３７％。新建校舍２４０多万平方米，新添学生课桌凳８０多万套，增加图书资料２００多万册，添置教学仪器１５０多万件。河北省共修建校舍１９０．５万平方米，有６４个县（市）消灭了年初的危险校舍，部分县（市）的学校在办学条件上有了明显的改善。
