China's most advanced non-toxic high-grade polyvinyl chloride (PVC) resin production line has recently started operation at the Jinxi Chemical Plant in Liaoning Province, filling another gap in China's chemical industry.

Previously, the non-toxic high-grade PVC resin used in China's pharmaceutical and food packaging industries had to be imported. The newly operational production line, which is of 1980s international advanced level, is a key project of the country's "Seventh Five-Year Plan." The equipment achieved success on its first trial run, with all six product types meeting the required standards.

After the production line starts full operation, it will be able to produce 40,000 tons of non-toxic high-grade PVC resin annually, with an output value of 120 million yuan and a profit and tax revenue of 40 million yuan.

　　我国聚氯乙烯树脂生产线在锦西投产
    本报讯  我国目前最先进的无毒高型号聚氯乙烯树脂生产线，最近在辽宁省锦西化工总厂正式投产，从而填补了我国又一项化工产品的空白。
    过去，我国医药、食品包装等行业使用的无毒高型号聚氯乙烯树脂一直依靠进口。新投产的这套引进装置具有８０年代国际先进水平，列入国家“七五”期间重点工程。这套装置作到一次试车成功，６种型号产品的质量全部符合标准。
    这条生产线投产后，可年产无毒高型号聚氯乙烯树脂４万吨，产值１．２亿元，创利税４０００万元。
