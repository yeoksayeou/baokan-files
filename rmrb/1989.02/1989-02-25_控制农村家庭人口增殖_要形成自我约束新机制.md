	Controlling Rural Household Population Growth: Establishing a New Mechanism for Self-Restraint
	People's Daily Reporter: Ai Xiao

	Wei Jinsheng, Associate Professor at Beijing Institute of Economics. Born in 1938, graduated from Peking University's Library Science Department in 1961. Began population studies in 1980, with nearly 20 academic papers on population studies, focusing on population migration, urbanization, and population control policies.

	Reporter: Over the past decade, China's population control and economic development have progressed together, achieving remarkable results. However, on the other hand, some data show that before 1979, China's average age of first marriage for women, late marriage rate, birth rate, and natural growth rate were all more favorable for population control. What is the reason for this?

	Wei Jinsheng: You've touched on the current difficulty in population control. The 1980s, compared to the 1970s, present a completely new situation. After 1979, the rural reforms centered around the household contract responsibility system were implemented. This not only promoted rural revitalization but also objectively strengthened the mechanism for household population growth. This change has made the state's existing population control system and methods increasingly inadequate. At the same time, the impact of China's birth peak from 1962 to 1973 is also increasingly negative. Just these two challenges have significantly increased the difficulty of population control in China.

	Reporter: What changes have occurred in the household population growth mechanism in rural areas over the past decade?

	Wei Jinsheng: The household population growth mechanism is determined by the family's demand for childbearing and the conditions to meet this demand, as well as the mutual relationship between the two. Before the reforms, the rural household economy was negated, and collective distribution of living materials was implemented based on the number of people. In 1978, the national per capita income of farmers was only over 130 yuan. Under these conditions, increasing the household population and labor force would not improve the household economy in most regions, significantly weakening the household population growth mechanism. After 1979, rural economic reforms made farmers independent producers and operators. At this time, the increase in household population and labor force directly affects the household's economic income and living conditions. By 1987, the national per capita income of farmers reached over 460 yuan, an increase of 2.5 times compared to 1978. Among these, the proportion of income from household operations increased from 27% in 1978 to 83%. Thus, the previously weakened household population growth mechanism was strengthened again, seeking to increase childbearing to enhance social and economic value.

	Reporter: Some statistical data show that the recent increase in farmers' household income levels is mainly reflected in the growth of expenditure on living necessities, while the growth in expenditure on enjoyment and development resources has not changed much. For example, from 1978 to 1987, farmers' expenditure on necessary living consumables increased from 116 yuan to 398 yuan, while expenditure on enjoyment and development resources only increased from 3 yuan to 20 yuan. Does this indicate that the awareness of the need for the latter has not formed, and thus it is impossible to have changes that are conducive to suppressing the demand for childbearing?

	Wei Jinsheng: Yes. China's current state of initial development, which is somewhat developed but not sufficiently developed, is an important factor in strengthening the household population growth mechanism. Another factor you may not have noticed is that currently, Chinese farmers only need to pay about 120 yuan per year to raise a child to adulthood. This cost-effective situation allows most farming households to easily afford the upbringing of several children. Additionally, China's rural labor force has been surplus by 30% to 40% for a long time, and most older children can help take care of younger ones. This economies of scale in child-rearing also significantly reduces indirect costs.

	Reporter: You mentioned earlier that "the state's existing population control system and methods are increasingly inadequate for the new situation of the reforms." What should be done?

	Wei Jinsheng: The current difficulty in population control is due to the inadequacy of "old methods meeting new situations." China's population control reform, compared to urban and rural economic system reforms, has only just begun. Now, population control reforms must quickly take substantial steps, transitioning from single-item reforms to coordinated reforms, and from shallow reforms to deep reforms.

	Reporter: What are your specific ideas?

	Wei Jinsheng: First, establish a unified concept of population, society, economy, resources, and environment, and formulate interconnected policies and development plans. Second, starting from adjusting family childbearing needs, indirectly guiding childbearing behavior, and forming a new mechanism for self-restraint in household population growth. There are two substantial influences on changing farmers' childbearing needs: one is to reduce the social and economic value of childbearing for families; the other is to increase the cost of childbearing for families.

	Reporter: Will farmers accept such guidance?

	Wei Jinsheng: This is not only necessary but also possible. The state, through the use of various means with economic measures as the main focus, must first make labor forces of different qualities have differences in employment choices and economic income, so that children with a higher quantity but lower quality in the future lose their social and economic value. Second, make the cost of families having more children in childbearing, upbringing, especially education, much higher compared to having fewer children, even to the point where the income these children may bring in the future is not enough to compensate. Currently, under the condition that semi-self-sufficient economy still occupies a large proportion in rural areas, the cost of childbearing and upbringing is so low, and the occurrence of school dropouts among primary and secondary school students, all objectively reduce the cost of childbearing, strengthening the population growth mechanism. Economic measures are not just simple economic rewards and punishments and economic responsibility systems. The role of economic levers such as taxation, pricing, credit, wages, and financial subsidies should also be given sufficient attention. As long as they are used appropriately, they can guide the object of economic levers—the family's childbearing activities—to the target that the subject of economic levers—the state—needs, through the inducement of material interests, that is, providing favorable or unfavorable, more beneficial or less beneficial conditions under different childbearing behaviors.

	Reporter: Is this economic measure a temporary solution?

	Wei Jinsheng: The state, through the use of various means to influence and change the family's childbearing needs, and then indirectly suppress its childbearing behavior to achieve the set goal, is a fundamental way and method to control population growth. Its effect will have a long-term stable impact. However, to truly achieve this, certain internal and external conditions are needed, that is, both a highly authoritative decision-making and coordinating body and a strong functional body responsible for specific organization and implementation are required.

　　控制农村家庭人口增殖  要形成自我约束新机制
    本报记者  艾笑
    魏津生，北京经济学院副教授。１９３８年生，１９６１年毕业于北京大学图书馆系。１９８０年开始从事人口学研究工作，著有人口学学术论文近２０篇，致力于人口迁移、城市化、人口控制政策等领域的研究。
    记者：近１０年来，我国人口增长控制和经济发展结伴而行，取得了举世瞩目的成就。但另一方面，从一些资料看，１９７９年以前的五六年中，我国的女性平均初婚年龄、晚婚率、出生率和自然增长率等水平，都比现在更有利于人口增长的控制。这是什么原因？
    魏津生：你正好谈到了当前人口增长控制的难点上。８０年代与７０年代比较，出现了一个全新的情况。１９７９以后推行了家庭联产承包责任制为中心的农村改革。它既推动了农村振兴，也在客观上强化了农民家庭人口增殖的机制。这个变化，使国家原有的人口增长控制体制和手段，变得越来越不适应；与此同时，我国自１９６２至１９７３年的生育高峰造成的周期性影响，也正好在这个时期显现出越来越大的消极作用。光来自这两方面的挑战，就大大增加了我国人口增长控制的难度。
    记者：这１０年来，我国农民家庭人口增殖机制发生了哪些变化呢？
    魏津生：家庭人口增殖机制是由家庭的生育需求和满足这一需求的条件及两者之间的相互关系来决定的。改革前，农村家庭经济被否定，实行的是按人头集体分配生存资料。１９７８年时，全国农民人均收入也只有１３０多元，在这样的条件下，家庭增殖人口和劳动力，在大多数地区，实际上不会改善家庭经济状况，家庭人口增殖机制显著弱化。１９７９年以后，农村的经济改革，使农民成为独立的生产经营者。这时的家庭人口和劳动力的增殖，直接关系着家庭的经济收入和生活状况。到了１９８７年，全国农民人均收入达到４６０多元，比１９７８年提高了２．５倍。其中来自家庭经营的收入，所占比重从１９７８年的２７％上升至８３％。这样，原已弱化了的家庭人口增殖机制，又以追求多生育孩子来提高社会经济价值的形式，被重新强化起来。
    记者：一些统计资料表明，近来农民家庭收入水平的提高，还是多表现在对生存资料支出量的增长上，而对享受和发展资料支出量的增长，却没有太大的变化。如１９７８至１９８７年农民用于必需的生存资料的生活消费品支出，从１１６元增加到３９８元，用于享受和发展资料的支出，仅从３元增加到２０元。这是不是说明后者需求增长的意识没有形成，就不可能发生有利于抑制生育需求的变化？
    魏津生：是的。中国当前这种有所发展、又发展不够的初始发展状态，正是强化农民家庭人口增殖的重要因素。你没有注意到的另一个因素是，现在中国农民把一个孩子养育到成人，每年自家只分散地支付１２０元就够了。这种便宜事，多数农民家庭承担几个孩子的抚育是没有问题的。加上中国农村劳动力长期剩余３０％—４０％，并且大部分年长的孩子可以带抚年幼的孩子。这种在孩子抚养上的规模效益，也在相当程度上减少了间接费用。
    记者：你前面谈到“国家原有的人口增长控制体制和手段，越来越不适应改革的新形势”，应该怎么办呢？
    魏津生：当前人口增长控制的难点，是由于“老办法遇到新情况”带来的不适应造成的。我国人口增长控制方面的改革，比起城乡经济体制改革来，仅仅才算开始。现在，控制人口增长的改革必须抓紧时间迈出实质性步伐，从单项改革转向配套改革，从浅层改革转向深层改革。
    记者：你的具体设想呢？
    魏津生：首先，建立人口、社会、经济、资源和环境五位一体的观念，制订相互联系的政策体系和发展计划。其次，从调节家庭生育需求入手，间接引导生育行为，形成家庭人口增殖自我约束的新机制。能够改变农民家庭生育需求的实质性影响有二：一是降低家庭生育孩子的社会经济价值；二是提高家庭生育孩子的成本。
    记者：这种引导，农民能够接受吗？
    魏津生：这样做不仅必要而且可能。国家通过运用以经济手段为主的多种手段，首先必须使具有不同质量的劳动力在就业选择和经济收入上拉开差距，致使现在生育数量较多、将来质量较差的孩子失去其社会经济价值。第二，使家庭多育孩子在生育、养育，特别是教育上付出的成本，与少育孩子相比，多到那些孩子以后可能带来收入都不足以补偿。而目前，在农村半自给经济仍占很大比重的条件下，生育和养育孩子支出费用那么少，加之中小学生辍学现象的发生，都在客观上有利于降低生育孩子的成本，强化人口增殖机制。经济手段不只是单纯的经济奖惩和经济责任制。对税收、价格、信贷、工资和财政补贴等经济杠杆的作用，也应给予足够的重视。只要运用得当，就可以通过物质利益的诱导，即在不同的生育行为下，给与有利或不利、利大或利小的条件，把经济杠杆的客体——家庭的生育活动，引导到经济杠杆的主体——国家所需要的目标上来。
    记者：这种经济手段，是不是权宜之计呢？
    魏津生：国家通过运用多种手段来影响和改变家庭的生育需求，再间接地抑制其生育行为，达到既定的目的，是一种根本性的控制人口增长的方式和方法，它的效果将会长期稳定地发生作用。但要真正做到这一点，是需要一定的内部和外部条件的，即既需要一个具有高度权威性的决策和协调机构，又需要有一个具体负责组织实施的强有力的职能机构。
