	Chongqing Dye Factory Ignores Safety, Horrific Accident Shocking
	Young Female Worker Dies in Dissolving Tank

	From our reporter: At around 3 AM on January 5, a young female worker at the Chongqing Dye Factory died in a "dissolving tank" while on duty.

	The "dissolving tank" in the dyeing section of the factory has a diameter of nearly two meters and a depth of over three meters. The semi-finished dye inside is in a liquid state with strong corrosiveness. Under steam heating, the temperature exceeds 75 degrees Celsius, and there is a vertical agitator stirring inside. On the early morning of January 5, there were three regular workers and two temporary workers on duty. The young female worker, Yang Renju, died in the "dissolving tank" between 3 AM and 4 AM. Shockingly, it was not until 17 hours after the accident that the factory leadership learned of the incident. The other workers on duty with Yang Renju continued their shift as if nothing had happened, even though one person was missing. It was only when the remains of the body and non-corrosive nylon rubber clothing fragments clogged the liquid filtration equipment that the accident was discovered. The reporter saw on the spot that such a slippery place had no safety protection facilities; on this highly dangerous post, someone was even wearing high-heeled shoes to work. It is understood that it was only after the accident that the factory hastily made iron railings.

	Chongqing Municipal Labor Bureau Director Xiong Changquan was shocked when interviewed by the reporter about this incident. He said that some enterprises implementing contract management only focus on production progress and neglect safety production, and some even use distributing holiday clothing or cosmetics to replace distributing labor protection supplies, resulting in increased accident hazards. He demanded that all factories, mines, and enterprises take this as a warning and do a good job in safety production and labor protection.

　　渝染料厂忽视安全  恶性事故骇人听闻
    女青工葬身溶解锅
    本报讯  元月五日凌晨三时许，重庆染料厂一名青年女工在工作中丧生于“溶解锅”。
    该厂染料工段溶解工序的“溶解锅”口径近两米，深达三米多，锅内半成品染料呈液体状，腐蚀性极强。在蒸气冲热下，温度高达七十五摄氏度以上，并有立式搅拌机搅拌。元月五日凌晨，有三名正式工和两名临时工当班，青年女工杨仁菊于三点至四点之间丧生于“溶解锅”中。令人吃惊的是，直到事故发生的十七个小时以后，厂领导同志才知此情。与杨仁菊同班的另外几人竟然在缺一人的情况下若无其事地交接班。直到尸体残渣和不易腐蚀的腈纶橡胶衣物碎片堵塞液体过滤设施时，才发现出了亡人事故。记者在现场看到，像这样一处极易溜滑的地方竟没有安全防护设施；在这一高度危险的岗位却有人穿高跟鞋上班。据了解，直到事故发生后，厂方才匆忙赶制了铁护栏。
    重庆市劳动局长熊长泉接受记者采访时对此事件十分震惊。他说，一些实行承包经营的企业，只看重生产进度，忽视安全生产，有的甚至用发放节日服装或美容化妆品来代替发放劳保用品，致使事故隐患增多。他要求各厂矿、企事业单位以此为戒，切实做好安全生产和劳动保护工作。　　　　　（康松）
