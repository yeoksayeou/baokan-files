	Changyi County's Democratic Handling of Unqualified Party Members
	Standards for Evaluating Party Members Made Public
	People's Daily reports: How to handle unqualified party members through democratic evaluation? In the past half year, Changyi County in Shandong Province has adhered to the principle of democratic openness, handing over the "bottom line" of this work to party members and the masses, achieving good results.

	Last September, when this work was rolled out in county-level agencies, some concerns emerged: first, the complex interpersonal relationships in agencies made people worry about offending a group by handling one person; second, it was difficult to identify unqualified party members in agencies, and the boundary between qualified and unqualified was hard to grasp, leading to fears of "flipping the pancake"; third, some leading cadres were afraid that "pulling out a radish would bring up the mud."

	The county committee regarded the handling of unqualified party members as an important measure to curb corruption and build a clean government. First, it required party leaders to participate in this activity as ordinary party members, voluntarily accepting public evaluation; second, it emphasized democracy and increased transparency; third, it broke through the network of relationships, resisted the trend of intercession, and exposed intercessors. County committee secretary Zhao Fengchi personally took charge of a pilot project.

	Based on extensive investigations and research, the county committee proposed 10 types of behavior for identifying unqualified party members in agencies and drew 5 policy boundaries: distinguishing between grumbling about a policy one does not understand at the moment and irresponsibly venting dissatisfaction; distinguishing between losses caused by lack of experience in reform and exploiting reform loopholes for personal gain; distinguishing between those willing to correct mistakes and those who do not repent; distinguishing between disagreements among comrades due to work and struggles for power and benefits; distinguishing between legitimate economic income allowed by policy and illegally obtained income. This provided a "mirror" for party members to evaluate and a standard for the masses to participate in the evaluation.

	During the democratic evaluation process, they ensured that major situations were known to party members and the masses, implementing five "transparencies":

	—Transparent investigation and survey: Before the evaluation, surveys were conducted using questionnaires, discussions, visits, and dialogues to solicit opinions widely;
	—Transparent democratic evaluation: Mass representatives were invited to participate in the evaluation of outstanding and unqualified party members, and the evaluation results were honestly reported to the party congress;
	—Transparent branch appraisal opinions: Based on the self-appraisal of party members and the results of democratic evaluation, the party branch appraised the performance of each party member, and met with the individual and all party members;
	—Transparent verification of problems: For party members found to have problems in the democratic evaluation, the party organization did not easily decide or deny, but carefully verified and obtained solid evidence, including verification with the individual;
	—Transparent organizational handling: To ensure that the organizational handling could withstand public evaluation by party members and the masses, withstand the review of higher-level party committees, and withstand historical verification, the work adhered to "three publicities." First, publicize the handling standards. Second, publicize the facts. Third, publicize the discussion and handling. Allow the person being handled to defend themselves, and also allow other party members to defend them. So far, 85 unqualified party members have been handled, accounting for 1.62% of the total number of party members. Among them, 23 were persuaded to leave or expelled, 22 received disciplinary actions, and 40 were given a period to correct their mistakes. Among the handled party members, 45 were state cadres, including 18 leading cadres.

	"Handling a few people, educating a large group." Sun Ruhui, a party member and cadre in the county tax bureau, worked in administrative management. Due to alcoholism, he often made mistakes. When asked to correct his mistakes within a period, he immediately quit drinking, worked diligently from morning to night, and the masses said: "After the democratic evaluation, the drunkard became a good family man." The organizational awareness of the majority of party members was further enhanced. Various units and departments of the party organization also established their own clean government systems and measures in combination with reality, striving to improve the self-awareness of party members and cadres in maintaining integrity.

### 昌邑县民主处置机关不合格党员  评议党员　尺度公开

　　昌邑县民主处置机关不合格党员   
    评议党员　尺度公开
    本报讯  怎样通过民主评议处置机关不合格党员？山东昌邑县在近半年的实践中，坚持民主公开的原则，把开展这项工作的“底”交给党员和群众，收到良好效果。
    去年９月，这项工作刚在县直机关铺开，就出现一些思想顾虑：一是机关人际关系复杂，担心处置一人得罪一群；二是机关不合格党员的问题不易认定，合格与不合格的界限难把握，担心翻“烧饼”；三是个别领导干部，怕拔出萝卜带出泥。
    县委把处置不合格党员，作为遏制腐败行为，建设廉洁机关的重要措施来抓。首先要求党员领导干部以普通党员的身份参加这项活动，自觉接受群众公议；其次要讲民主，增强透明度；再是冲破关系网，顶住说情风，给说情者“曝光”。县委书记赵凤池还亲自抓点。
    县委在广泛调查研究的基础上，提出机关不合格党员的１０种表现，划清５条政策界限：把对某项政策一时想不通发牢骚，同不顾事实肆意宣泄不满情绪区别开；把因改革缺乏经验造成损失，同钻改革空子，以权谋私区别开；把愿意改正错误同不思悔改的区别开；把同志间因工作产生的意见分歧同争权夺利区别开；把政策允许的正当经济收入同不择手段捞取非法收入区别开。这就使党员评议有了“镜子”，群众参加评议有了尺度。
    在民主评议过程中，他们注意做到重大情况让党员群众知道，实行五个“透明”：
    ——调查摸底透明：评议前先以调查问卷、座谈、走访、对话等形式开展调查，广泛征求意见；
    ——民主评议透明：吸收群众代表参加评议优秀党员和不合格党员，评议情况如实向党员大会反馈；
    ——支部鉴定意见透明：根据党员自我鉴定和民主评议结果，党支部对每个党员平时表现做出鉴定，并同本人见面，同全体党员见面；
    ——查证核实问题透明：对民主评议出有问题的党员，党组织不轻易决定和否定，而是认真查证核实，掌握真凭实据，包括同本人核实；
    ——组织处理透明：为使组织处理经得起党员群众公议，经得起上级党委审议，经得起历史检验，工作中坚持了“三个公开”。一是公开处理标准。二是公开事实。三是公开讨论处理。允许处置对象自我申辩，也允许其他党员为其辩护。到目前为止，已处置不合格党员８５名，占党员总数的１．６２％。其中，劝退，除名２３人，党纪处分２２人，限期改正错误４０人。在被处置的党员中，国家干部４５人，其中领导干部１８人。
    “处置少数人，教育一大片”。县税务局党员干部孙汝辉做行政管理工作，因嗜酒成癖，经常误事，要他限期改正错误，马上戒了酒，工作不分份内份外，起早贪黑地干，群众说：“经过民主评议醉汉变成了理家人。”广大党员的组织观点进一步增强。各单位各部门的党组织还结合实际，分别建立了各自的廉政制度和措施，努力提高党员干部保持廉洁的自觉性。
