In the history of legislation in our country, there have been three instances where draft laws were submitted for public discussion. The first was the 1954 Constitution draft, the second was the 1982 Constitution draft, and the third was the draft of the Administrative Litigation Law published on November 10th last year. Submitting the draft of the Administrative Litigation Law for public discussion not only highlights the importance of this law but also indicates the development of our people's democracy.

New Milestone

In recent years, many ordinary people have filed complaints against officials, but very few have won their cases. Some people describe this situation as "officials suing citizens is almost always successful, but citizens suing officials have no recourse." Therefore, some legal scholars have strongly advocated for the establishment of an administrative litigation system in our country. Several laws passed by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and administrative regulations issued by the State Council have increasingly stipulated that citizens and legal entities can sue officials. In line with this process, many people's courts in our country have established administrative trial divisions and have accepted a large number of administrative litigation cases. In 1987, courts at all levels across the country accepted 5,240 first-instance administrative cases and concluded 4,677. Among the 2,225 concluded public security administrative cases, 1,476 were upheld by the public security organs, accounting for 66.3%; 203 were overturned, accounting for 9.1%. In the first eight months of 1988, courts at all levels across the country accepted 5,401 first-instance administrative cases and concluded 4,473. Among the 1,945 concluded public security administrative cases, 1,182 were upheld by the public security organs, accounting for 60.8%; 238 were overturned, accounting for 12.2%. In the 2,528 other administrative cases concluded in the first eight months of 1988, 1,061 were upheld by the administrative organs, accounting for 42%; 267 were overturned, accounting for 10.6%; and 207 were modified, accounting for 8.1%. The reason for overturning or modifying these cases is that the original administrative decisions had insufficient evidence or incorrect application of the law. Without administrative litigation, these erroneous or unfair administrative decisions would be difficult to correct!

As more and more people recognize the importance of the Administrative Litigation Law, the draft of the Administrative Litigation Law has been highly valued by all parties after its publication. Democratic parties and social organizations have held discussion meetings, legal experts have held discussion meetings, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress has convened a national discussion meeting with representatives from local people's congresses, local governments, and courts, as well as some legal experts, and the Legislative Affairs Office of the State Council has also convened a discussion meeting mainly attended by representatives from local government legal departments. Some ordinary cadres and the masses have also written letters to newspapers, actively participating in the discussion. Many comrades say that after the promulgation of the Administrative Litigation Law, if administrative organs and their personnel infringe upon the legal rights and interests of citizens and legal entities, or arbitrarily impose obligations on citizens and legal entities, citizens and legal entities can sue the government. This is a new milestone in the history of our country's democratic and legal construction.

Heated Debate on Several Issues

The issues that sparked the most heated debates during the discussion are mainly the following three:

(1) Can government regulations be used as the basis for the people's courts to adjudicate administrative cases?

Some people believe they can. The reasons are: first, the broad definition of law includes regulations; second, so far, the National People's Congress and its Standing Committee have passed only about 70 laws, and the State Council has issued only about 800 administrative regulations, with very few local regulations related to administration. Local governments mainly rely on regulations to carry out their work. In this regard, we should "consider the national conditions"; third, if regulations are not used as the basis for court judgments, the enforcement of regulations will encounter difficulties, which will affect the administration of law and administrative activities.

Others believe they cannot. The reasons are: first, the laws mentioned in the Constitution of our country include only the Constitution, laws, administrative regulations, and local regulations, but not regulations; second, the content of regulations is chaotic, with many contradictions, and some regulations have stipulated matters that should not be regulated by regulations (such as the establishment of penalties); third, if regulations are used as the basis for judgments, what is the difference in the level of effectiveness between regulations and local regulations? Why would local governments need to submit local regulations to the local people's congress for approval? Fourth, the authority of provincial and municipal governments and other local governments to formulate regulations is granted by the Constitution and the local organization law. Government regulations are normative documents for administrative organs to carry out administrative management activities, binding all citizens and organizations within their jurisdiction. Regulations not being used as the basis for court judgments does not mean they "do not count."

(2) Can the court modify the administrative decisions made by administrative organs?

Some comrades believe that the court can only uphold or overturn administrative decisions, but not modify them. The reasons are: first, if the court has the power to modify administrative decisions, it means replacing administrative discretion with judicial discretion, which is judicial interference in administrative power; second, the draft of the Administrative Litigation Law states that administrative decisions that are "unfairly light or heavy" or "obviously unfair" can be modified, but what constitutes "unfairly light or heavy"? What constitutes "obviously unfair"? It is difficult to determine an objective standard.

Another group of comrades believe that the Administrative Litigation Law should stipulate that the court has limited power to modify administrative decisions. Otherwise, the court's judicial power would be incomplete. If the court does not have the power to modify administrative decisions, it cannot effectively protect the legal rights and interests of citizens, legal entities, and non-legal entities; moreover, if the court still recognizes those obviously unfair administrative decisions after trial, it will inevitably affect the government and the court's prestige among the people.

(3) What is the legislative purpose of the Administrative Litigation Law?

Comrades from the government's legal departments and some legal scholars believe that the legislative purpose of the Administrative Litigation Law should include both protecting the legal rights and interests of citizens and legal entities and ensuring and maintaining the lawful exercise of power by administrative organs. They disagree with the wording in the draft of the Administrative Litigation Law "to promote the lawful exercise of administrative power by state administrative organs," believing that the word "promote" will put administrative organs in a passive position. Although they believe that the people's courts, through the trial of administrative litigation cases, actually play a role in judicial supervision of administrative organs, they believe that our country does not have a separation of powers, and therefore it is not appropriate to include the word "supervision" in the legislative purpose.

However, a considerable number of people disagree with the above opinions. This group of people believes that the purpose of formulating the Administrative Litigation Law is to ensure that the people's courts can correctly and timely try administrative cases, effectively protect the legal rights and interests of citizens and legal entities, and promote the lawful exercise of power by state administrative organs. An old professor even said that the main purpose of formulating the Administrative Litigation Law is to supervise administrative organs in the lawful exercise of administrative power.

No matter what, having debates is a good thing. Submitting the draft of the Administrative Litigation Law for public discussion is to hear various opinions. Now, the debate over different opinions is still ongoing. Through the debate, the legislative organs can understand which parts of the draft are appropriate, which are not, and what is missing or insufficient, thereby making the Administrative Litigation Law better. This matter shows that the construction of our country's legal system has indeed made significant progress.

　　激烈争论可以产生好法律
    ——讨论行政诉讼法草案述评
    本报记者  王礼明
    在我国立法史上，法律草案交付全民讨论的，共有三次。第一次是１９５４年宪法草案，第二次是１９８２年宪法草案，第三次就是去年１１月１０日公布的行政诉讼法草案。将行政诉讼法草案交全民讨论，既说明这个法的重要，也说明我们的人民民主发展了。
    　　　　新的里程碑
    前几年，老百姓通过上访告官的很多，但告赢的极少。有人把这种情况描述为“官告民一个准，民告官没有门”。于是，一些法学家强烈呼吁要在我国建立行政诉讼制度；全国人大常委会通过的一些法律和国务院制定的一些行政法规，也越来越多地规定了公民和法人可以告官的内容。与这个进程相适应，我国不少人民法院也建立了行政审判庭，并受理了一大批行政诉讼案件。１９８７年，全国各级法院共受理一审行政案件５２４０件，审结４６７７件。在审结的２２２５件治安行政案件中，维持公安机关裁决的１４７６件，占６６．３％；撤销２０３件，占９．１％。１９８８年１至８月，全国各级法院共受理一审行政案件５４０１件，审结４４７３件。在审结的１９４５件治安行政案件中，维持公安机关裁决的１１８２件，占６０．８％；撤销２３８件，占１２．２％。在１９８８年１至８月审结的２５２８件其他行政案件中，维持行政机关决定的１０６１件，占４２％；撤销２６７件，占１０．６％；变更２０７件，占８．１％。所以要撤销，是因为原行政处理决定主要证据不足，或适用法律错误。如果不搞行政诉讼，这些错误的或显失公正的行政处理决定，恐怕就很难得到纠正了！
    由于越来越多的人认识到行政诉讼法重要，所以，行政诉讼法草案公布以后，各方面都很重视。民主党派和社会团体开过讨论会，法律专家开过讨论会，全国人大常委会召开过有地方人大、地方政府和法院的负责同志以及一部分法律专家参加的全国性讨论会，国务院法制局也召开过主要有地方政府法制部门负责人参加的讨论会。一些普通干部和群众也向报刊写信，积极参加讨论。许多同志说，行政诉讼法颁布以后，行政机关及其工作人员如果侵犯公民、法人的合法权益，或者随意给公民、法人设定义务，公民和法人就可以告政府了。这是我国民主和法制建设史上新的里程碑。
    　　　　激烈争论的几个问题
    在讨论过程中争论比较激烈的，主要是以下三个问题：
    （一）政府规章是否可以作为人民法院审判行政案件的依据？
    有些人认为可以。理由是：第一，广义的法，也包括规章；第二，到目前为止，全国人大和全国人大常委会通过的法律只有７０多件，国务院制定的行政法规只有８００多件，地方性法规中与行政有关的很少。地方政府办事，主要依据规章。在这个问题上，“要考虑中国国情”；第三，如果不把规章作为法院判案的依据，规章的执行就会遇到困难，就会影响依法进行行政管理活动。
    也有一些人认为不可以。理由是：第一，我国宪法中所说的法，只包括宪法、法律、行政法规和地方性法规，不包括规章；第二，规章内容较乱，互相矛盾的地方不少，而且规定了一些不应当由规章规定的内容（例如设立罚则）；第三，如果把规章作为判案依据，规章与地方性法规的效力等级还有什么区别？地方政府还有什么必要提请地方人大制定地方性法规？第四，省市政府等地方政府制定规章，是宪法和地方组织法赋予的职权。政府规章是行政机关进行行政管理活动的规范性文件，对其辖区内的所有公民和组织都有拘束力。规章不作法院判案依据，不等于“不算数”。
    （二）法院能不能变更行政机关的行政处理决定？
    一部分同志认为，法院只能维持或者撤销行政处理决定，不能变更行政处理决定。理由是：第一，法院如果对行政处理决定享有变更权，就意味着是用司法自由裁量权代替行政自由裁量权，就是司法权干预行政权；第二，行政诉讼法草案说行政处理决定“畸轻畸重”、“显失公正”的可以变更，但什么样是“畸轻畸重”？什么样是“显失公正”？很难确定一个客观标准。
    另一部分同志认为，行政诉讼法应当规定法院对行政处理决定有有限的变更权。否则，法院的审判权就不完整。如果法院对行政处理决定没有变更权，就不能有效地保护公民、法人和非法人团体的合法权益；而且，法院经过审理后还认可那些显失公正的行政决定，势必会影响政府和法院在群众中的威信。
    （三）行政诉讼法的立法宗旨是什么？
    政府法制部门的同志和一些法学家认为，行政诉讼法的立法宗旨，既应包括保护公民和法人的合法权益，也应包括保障和维护行政机关依法行使职权。他们不同意行政诉讼法草案中“促使国家行政机关依法行使行政权力”的提法，认为“促使”二字，会把行政机关置于被动地位。他们虽然认为人民法院通过审理行政诉讼案件，对行政机关实际上起到了司法监督的作用，但认为我们国家不是三权分立，因而不宜在立法宗旨的表述上出现“监督”字样。
    但是，也有相当多的人不同意上面的意见。这部分人认为，制定行政诉讼法的目的，就是为了保证人民法院能够正确及时地审理行政案件，有效地保护公民和法人的合法权益，促使国家行政机关依法行使职权。有位老教授甚至说，制定行政诉讼法的主要目的就是监督行政机关依法行使行政权力。
    不管怎么说，有争论总是好事。把行政诉讼法草案交付全民讨论，就是要听取各方面的不同意见。现在，不同意见的争论还在进行。通过争论，立法机关就可以了解到，这个草案的规定哪些是合适的，哪些是不合适的，还有哪些遗漏和不足，从而把行政诉讼法修改得更好。这件事情表明，我国法制建设确是大大前进了。
