Since the 1950s, Beijing residents have made participating in and watching the New Year's Eve City Circuit Race on the morning of the third day of the Lunar New Year a traditional part of their holiday celebrations. However, the organizers of this event recently announced that due to various reasons, the city circuit race, which has a history of over 30 years, will have to be canceled.

The Beijing New Year's Eve City Circuit Race, which began in 1956, has played a positive role in enhancing the festive atmosphere and enriching cultural life. A responsible person from the Beijing Municipal Sports Commission explained that in recent years, various cultural and entertainment activities during the New Year period have increased, and people have used the holiday to visit relatives and friends, go to temple fairs, and participate in the city circuit race. The number of participants has been declining, and even administrative measures have been used to allocate quotas. On the contrary, the competition expenses have increased by about 10,000 yuan each year, from the production cost of commemorative medals for participants to the subsidy for staff to maintain safety and order, all of which have increased, making it difficult to sustain.

In recent years, Beijing's urban roads have been widened, making the city circuit race even more difficult. A single competition can affect the public transportation of dozens of routes, and the use of roads for competitions requires layer-by-layer approval, which has caused the organizing units a lot of headaches. Some veteran long-distance runners have written to the Sports Commission to express their regret at losing the opportunity to showcase their skills in the competition, but their requests can only be partially compensated in a short-distance spring long-distance running competition in late March.

Meanwhile, another traditional event in Beijing is also facing an ominous situation. With the rise of the volleyball craze following China's women's volleyball team's three consecutive championships, Beijing launched the "Revitalize China Cup" volleyball tournament for primary and secondary school students in 1985, which at the time attracted 86 small volleyball teams. This year is the fifth tournament, but only 35 teams have signed up.

It is understood that many young people are interested in volleyball, but the main reason for the decrease in teams is the difficulty in organizing. With the increasing activity of the commodity economy, the small subsidies for physical education teachers to guide extracurricular training are still not guaranteed. A middle school teacher who actively initiated this event has left teaching to start a business. Students from a middle school in Dongcheng District, without the guidance of teachers, formed a team and participated in the competition on their own. How can such a team be sustained? Even a school with the title of a traditional volleyball project has not been able to gather six decent players and has given up the competition. The men's middle school group only had four school teams.

School sports competitions, without the financial support of the education and sports departments, and unable to attract corporate sponsorship, are likely to be discontinued. However, so many young people eager to participate in sports training and competitions, who will satisfy their desire to participate in sports training and competitions, and how?

In recent years, there has been much discussion in the sports departments about the institutionalization, diversification, and high-level development of mass activities, but it is quite difficult to organize mass competitions. The form of competitions can be changed and innovated, but it still requires coordination from all aspects of society to create the necessary conditions. The problem is that even in the future when the situation of social sports becomes widespread, guiding and organizing mass sports, including mass competitions, will still be an important task and function of the sports departments.

Some grassroots sports workers and sports enthusiasts hope that the sports departments will do less talking and more solving of practical problems.

### 不该匿迹的赛事

　　不该匿迹的赛事
    本报记者  汪大昭
    从５０年代开始，北京人已把正月初三早上参加和观看春节环城赛跑，作为欢度佳节的传统“节目”。但是，这项竞赛活动的组织者日前宣布，种种原因使已有３０多年历史的春节环城赛不得不取消。
    始于１９５６年的首都春节环城赛跑，对增添节日气氛、活跃文化生活，起过良好作用。北京市体委一位负责人解释说，近几年，春节期间各种文娱活动越来越多，人们利用假日走亲访友，赶庙会，参加环城赛跑的人数有下降趋势，甚至得用行政手段摊派名额。相反，比赛经费开支却以每年一万元左右递增，从颁发给参赛者的纪念章制作费，到付给工作人员维持安全秩序的补助费，无不看涨，实在吃不消。
    这些年，北京城市街道拓宽了，环城长跑反倒更难，一次比赛要影响几十条线路的公共交通，占用道路比赛需层层审批，足让主办单位伤透脑筋。一些老“长跑”们为失去显示身手的比赛机会投书体委，但他们的要求只能在３月底一次距离不长的春季长跑比赛中寻求补偿。
    与此同时，北京市另一项传统赛事也出现了不祥之兆。伴随中国女排夺取三连冠而兴起的排球热当中，北京市于１９８５年搞起了全市中小学生振兴中华杯排球赛，当时曾吸引了８６支小排球队上阵。今年是第五届比赛了，报名的仅剩３５个队。
    据了解，青少年喜爱排球运动的不少，队伍锐减的原因主要是组织工作上的困难。
    商品经济日渐活跃，体育教师辅导课余训练的些微补助却仍无保证，曾积极发起这项赛事的一位中学教师弃教从商而去。东城区一所中学的学生在得不到教师带领和指导下，自己组队报名上场，这样的队伍如何维持得住？甚至挂着排球运动传统项目学校的牌子，居然凑不出六个像样的队员而放弃比赛，初中男子组总共才来了四个学校的球队。
    学校体育竞赛既无教育和体育部门的经费托底，又难以吸引厂商赞助，只怕非得收场不可了。但是，那么多在排球网前跃跃欲试的青少年，又该由谁、用什么办法，来满足他们参加体育锻炼和比赛的渴求呢？
    这几年，体育部门对群体活动向制度化、多样化和高水平发展的议论不少，而举办群众性竞赛活动却挺难。竞赛的形式可以变化和创新，但总还得社会各方面协调，创造必要条件。问题在于即便将来广泛形成社会办体育的局面后，指导和组织群众体育，包括群众性竞赛活动，仍然是体育部门的重要工作和职能。
    一些身处基层的体育工作者和体育爱好者希望体育部门少一点坐而论道，多解决几个实际问题。
