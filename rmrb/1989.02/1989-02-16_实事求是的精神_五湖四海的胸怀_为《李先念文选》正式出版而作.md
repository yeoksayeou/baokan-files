The Selected Works of Li Xiannian has been officially published and distributed. More than thirty years later, revisiting the important articles written by Comrade Xiannian when he was in charge of work in Hubei in the early years of the founding of the nation, we who worked directly under his leadership at that time feel particularly close to them. Under the leadership of the Central Committee and Chairman Mao, Comrade Xiannian's spirit of seeking truth from facts in guiding work and his broad-mindedness in uniting cadres, vividly reappears in our minds. His correct guidance and excellent style not only played an important role in the successful development of work in Hubei at that time, but also deeply benefited the cadres, especially the leading cadres at various levels, and had a long-term positive impact on the subsequent work in Hubei. We, the comrades who participated in the discussion of this article, eagerly want to express our feelings and insights, hoping to serve as a reference for readers when they read the Selected Works; especially hoping to benefit the comrades in Hubei, so that they can continue the spirit of carrying forward the past and opening up the future, do a better job in Hubei, and make more contributions to the great cause of "realizing the Four Modernizations and revitalizing China."

When Hubei was liberated, the question of determining the focus of work was immediately faced. In essence, this was a question of how to adhere to the thought line of seeking truth from facts, proceed from the actual situation in Hubei, and creatively implement the spirit of the Central Committee's instructions. In February 1949, the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee decided to shift the Party's work focus from the countryside to the cities. The period of surrounding the cities from the countryside had ended, and a new period of leading the countryside from the cities had begun. This was undoubtedly correct from the perspective of historical period transformation and the overall situation of the country. Specifically, how should this be implemented in Hubei at that time? Comrades who have worked with Comrade Xiannian know that he is a person with a strong sense of organization, always firmly executing the instructions of the Central Committee; but he has never simply copied and pasted, but rather insisted on investigation and study, proceeding from the actual situation of the locality, and creatively implementing and executing. During the eight years of the War of Resistance, in the E-Yu area far from the Party Central Committee, where the enemy's strength was very strong and the Kuomintang diehards frequently created "frictions," he led the New Fourth Army's Fifth Division to grow from small to large and from weak to strong, and engaged in arduous and unyielding struggles with the enemy. This was very important because he was good at correctly analyzing the complex situation at that time, creatively using the Central Committee's policies and strategic principles, and fully demonstrating the spirit and ability of independent combat. In the post-liberation Hubei, how to determine the focus of work, Comrade Xiannian also demonstrated this spirit. He firmly agreed with and executed the policy of "focusing on the countryside while also considering the cities" proposed by the Central China Bureau and approved by the Central Committee, and at the First Session of the Hubei Provincial Party Representatives Conference held in August 1949, he seriously analyzed the objective and subjective conditions of Hubei at that time, deeply expounded the necessity and importance of implementing this policy at that time. In the subsequent historical practice, it was fully proven that this policy was correct.

		Revisiting Comrade Xiannian's speech at this conference, we once again feel deeply benefited by the fact that he not only analyzed the important situation that "the feudal rule in the countryside had not changed much" in Hubei as a newly liberated area, but also deeply analyzed the important role of agriculture in supporting industry and the overall development of the national economy. He pointed out: "The cities in Hubei are economically fragile, mostly consumer-oriented and commercial-oriented. Although there are some industries in the cities, they are highly dependent on the countryside... The raw materials needed for urban industrial production and the market for product sales are mainly in the countryside. But at present, the countryside is still under the oppression of feudal forces, the peasants are poor and suffering from hunger and cold, production cannot be improved, they cannot provide more industrial raw materials, nor do they have a large purchasing power. Under such conditions, the urban economy is difficult to prosper. We must do a good job in rural work and develop the rural economy to turn the backward countryside into an advanced countryside and the backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial country." From this guiding ideology, Comrade Xiannian personally took charge of agriculture, persistently took charge of agriculture, especially in the face of the serious threat of water and drought disasters in Hubei, he vigorously promoted water conservancy construction to create necessary conditions for the stability and development of agriculture, making Hubei's agriculture not only quickly restored, but also opened up a prosperous development trend. Looking back now, Comrade Xiannian's understanding and practice of the agricultural issue still have important guiding significance to this day and even in the future. We are pleased to see that after Comrade Xiannian left Hubei in 1954, the comrades in Hubei have always adhered to the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation, making Hubei one of the important agricultural bases in the country with grain, cotton, and oil as the main products, and making due contributions to the country. The recent National Rural Work Conference held by the Party Central Committee made an important decision to further vigorously develop agriculture. We believe that Hubei, which has a good tradition in agriculture, will definitely seriously implement and carry out the decision of the Central Committee, making Hubei's agriculture shine with new splendor.

		In the period of restoring the national economy and the First Five-Year Plan, Hubei, like the rest of the country, achieved unprecedented great achievements in construction. How to correctly treat the victory is a severe test we face. As early as May 1951, at a county committee secretary meeting convened by the Provincial Party Committee, Comrade Xiannian sharply pointed out the need to "oppose unrealistic empty praise," seriously criticized the erroneous tendency of some comrades to be blindly optimistic, empty and unrealistic, and required that this erroneous tendency be solved as one of the two major issues in the ideological construction of cadres. Comrade Xiannian has always insisted on the working attitude and style of speaking the truth, doing honest work, and being an honest person. Until later, our comrades in Hubei basically maintained this good style. Unfortunately, during the "Great Leap Forward," we were also intoxicated by victory, in the atmosphere of blind optimism and impatience for success, we became feverish, set high targets, overestimated production, launched "satellites," and the wind of exaggeration prevailed. Recalling these foolish deeds and the harm they caused, we still feel painful. In September 1958, Comrade Xiannian inspected Hubei, which was at the height of our feverishness. He did not praise those exaggerated "achievements," but instead instructed the provincial committee leaders accompanying him to pour some cold water and lower the temperature, and praised a deputy secretary of a regional committee who had reflected some real situations to him. Later, under the leadership of the Central Committee, the Hubei Provincial Party Committee corrected the errors, implemented the requirement of one of the three major styles of our Party, self-criticism, and consciously and relatively early recognized, examined, and corrected the errors, making up for some of the losses. This also had Comrade Xiannian's education and help for us. Last year, when Comrade Xiannian inspected work in Hubei, he again earnestly reminded the comrades in Hubei to remember the lessons of history and required the comrades in Hubei to "resolutely and ruthlessly oppose telling lies." The Hubei Provincial Party Committee issued his speech and required all county-level cadres to study it seriously and carry it out resolutely. This practice is very necessary. We sincerely hope that the cadres in Hubei will always keep the requirement of speaking the truth, doing honest work, and being an honest person in mind.

	(2)

The responsibility of leadership is twofold: one is to come up with ideas, and the other is to use cadres. Comrade Xiannian, with the broad-mindedness of the Five Lakes and Four Seas, correctly executed the Party's cadre policy, closely united the cadres who gathered in Hubei from all directions, united the patriotic friends outside the Party and the knowledgeable intellectuals with outstanding talents around the Party, and united all possible forces, creating a good atmosphere and laying a good foundation for the construction of the cadre team in Hubei. The great significance of this matter for the work in Hubei has become more profound with the development of history. During the ten-year catastrophe of the "Cultural Revolution," the leading cadres at various levels in Hubei Province performed well and were generally united in major aspects, thus enabling Hubei Province to resist some of the destructive activities of the Lin Biao and the "Gang of Four," reducing the losses in work and production. This is a historical test of the cadre team construction in Hubei Province since Comrade Xiannian took charge of the work.

		After the liberation of Hubei, cadres came from all directions, truly from the Five Lakes and Four Seas. Just take the people who participated in the discussion of this article as an example, there are those from the Fifth Division, Hebei, Henan, Shanxi, and Shandong; there are old subordinates who have followed Comrade Xiannian on the battlefield for many years, and there are new comrades-in-arms who only got to know each other after coming to Hubei from North China, Northeast, and East China. It can be said that this is a microcosm of the cadres in Hubei at that time coming from the Five Lakes and Four Seas. Of course, our Party has rich experience in cadre issues. Five Lakes and Four Seas, appointing the best; being kind to others, treating diseases and saving people; "understanding, supporting, and friendship between the upper and lower levels of the Party Committee are more important than anything else"; not only being good at uniting comrades who agree with one's own opinions, but also being good at uniting comrades who disagree with one's own opinions to work together, etc., are all the crystallization of the experience of the whole Party. These principles and methods are not easy to truly achieve, but Comrade Xiannian has modelly executed the Party's cadre policy, practiced these principles and methods, and demonstrated his personal cohesiveness in uniting cadres.

		Comrade Xiannian treated cadres impartially, regardless of closeness or distance, truly regarded cadres as the Party's cadres, regardless of which place they came from, and sincerely affirmed and welcomed the progress and work achievements of comrades, thus being able to correctly handle the relationship between local cadres and outsiders, old cadres and new cadres, Party cadres and non-Party cadres, and unite all possible forces. He publicly announced to a group of old subordinates of the Fifth Division: "You should start from work, correctly evaluate yourself, respect the comrades from other places, and those in deputy positions should be content with being assistants." He sharply criticized those with "factional" tendencies, saying: "The Communist Party is a Marxist-Leninist party, not a faction or a small group, and should not have 'factions' or regional divisions, nor can it divide close and distant relationships by personal relationships. The promotion of cadres can only be based on the interests of the Party and the people, and it is not allowed to take the wrong path." For the old cadres who were in various leading positions, Comrade Xiannian earnestly reminded them to "throw off the burden of being a hero, get rid of the arrogance and complacency, and use the spirit of not being afraid of sacrificing their lives for the revolution to learn new knowledge and skills, and adapt to the new work requirements"; and he pointed out with deep concern: "Cultivating a large number of outstanding new cadres is a responsibility and an honor for old cadres. If done well, it is another merit for the Party." To help cadres of worker and peasant origin learn, Comrade Xiannian actively advocated that worker and peasant cadres learn culture and established worker and peasant accelerated middle schools. Many comrades who graduated from the accelerated middle schools still remember the great benefits they received from this period of study to this day. For new cadres, from the moment of liberation, Comrade Xiannian paid great attention to absorbing and cultivating a large number of them, clearly pointing out that "selecting a large number of new cadres is not only related to the completion of the current work tasks, but also related to whether socialism can be built." When Hubei was just liberated, there were fewer than 4,000 old cadres in the provincial-level organs. Within less than three months of the establishment of the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government, the Provincial Party Committee established the Hubei Revolutionary University, with Comrade Xiannian personally serving as the president, training 15,316 students, excluding 3,102 who were transferred by the Central Committee, the vast majority were assigned to work in various local, various levels of party, government, military organs, and people's organizations in the province. These comrades, after long-term revolutionary struggles and construction practices, have become the backbone of work in various places and departments in Hubei.

		Comrade Xiannian also paid special attention to the role of intellectuals. As early as the Second Session of the Provincial Party Representatives Conference in 1950, Comrade Xiannian systematically analyzed the issue of intellectuals in his summary report, clearly pointing out that intellectuals are people in the revolutionary camp, and "looking down on them is completely wrong, and is a reflection of backward peasant thinking." Later, in September 1952, he wrote important comments on a report by the Provincial United Front Department on the issue of intellectuals, more sharply and deeply pointing out: "Some of our comrades seem to think that it is not frightening enough that now 80-90% of the people in China are illiterate, and do not respect intellectuals, do not strive to, unite, and use them to change this situation. Some comrades even look down on intellectuals with narrow-minded peasant ideas and try to restrict them with various incorrect methods. This is such a wrong idea!" The broad masses of intellectuals in Hubei, including a large number of outstanding experts and professors, suffered hardships and experienced hardships in the expansion of the anti-rightist struggle, especially in the ten-year catastrophe of the "Cultural Revolution," but their sincere hearts of loyalty to the motherland and the cause of the people did not change. After the great historical turning point of the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, they immediately regained their youth, with unparalleled willpower to make up for the lost time, and many experts over fifty, even those in their sixties and seventies, still joined the Party organization with excited and joyful hearts. It can be said that this is also inseparable from the correct execution of the Party's policy on intellectuals in the early years of the founding of the nation, which gave them confidence and strength. From their personal experiences before and after liberation, they firmly believed that only the Communist Party could save China. They firmly believed that our Party would definitely correct its own mistakes, and firmly believed that the Party's correct policy on intellectuals would definitely be restored and carried forward. Our Party will not betray the precious trust of intellectuals, and under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee, we, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and intellectuals, will unite and struggle together, and will definitely welcome the spring of science and education, and welcome new victories in the entire modernization construction cause.

		What made people feel most comfortable when working with Comrade Xiannian was that he, on the premise of adhering to principles, treated people sincerely, equally, and kindly, with a heart of kindness to all. Comrade Xiannian's requirements for cadres were strict, and when criticism was needed, he would criticize, and sometimes the criticism was quite severe. However, because he was sincere, frank, emphasized facts, followed policies, viewed people comprehensively, viewed people historically, and allowed for defense and welcomed correction, even if criticized, one still felt convinced and close to the heart. This is the charm and style of Comrade Xiannian in uniting cadres. In this regard, there is an important matter that we felt deeply and had a good influence on the work in Wuhan. In early 1952, a complex case occurred in Wuhan City, and the Wuhan Municipal Party Committee was reorganized as a result. The Central Committee appointed Comrade Xiannian to concurrently serve as the First Secretary of the Wuhan Municipal Party Committee and the Mayor. At that time, many cadres in Wuhan were anxious, fearing being implicated; and at that time, there were indeed a few comrades sent to Wuhan who took the problem seriously, thinking that a batch of cadres still needed to be dealt with. In this situation, Comrade Xiannian insisted on a thorough and comprehensive understanding and analysis of the work in Wuhan in a spirit of seeking truth from facts, and on this basis, formally reported to the Central Committee, clearly affirming that the work in Wuhan had seriously implemented the Party's line, principles, and policies, thus correctly protecting and further mobilizing the enthusiasm of the cadres in Wuhan, not only stabilizing the work in Wuhan, but also promoting the work in Wuhan to develop more vigorously.

		The Selected Works of Li Xiannian is a very worthy book to learn from, and many important viewpoints and valuable experiences in the Selected Works still have practical guiding significance today. The scope of the insights we have written in this article is limited to the four or five years when Comrade Xiannian was in charge of work in Hubei in the early years of the founding of the nation, and even for this period of time, we have only written a few insights that we have felt deeply. We will continue to systematically and seriously study with the readers, especially the comrades in Hubei, and strive to gain more enlightenment from it, use it to improve our thinking, improve our style, guide our work, and make more contributions to the cause of the Party and the people.

　　实事求是的精神　五湖四海的胸怀
    ——为《李先念文选》正式出版而作
    王任重　赵辛初
    《李先念文选》正式出版发行了。三十多年后的今天，重温先念同志于建国初期主持湖北工作时的一些重要文章，对于我们这些当时在他直接领导下工作过的人来讲，倍感亲切。先念同志在中央和毛主席的领导下，指导工作的实事求是精神和团结干部的“五湖四海”胸怀，生动地重现在我们的脑海。他的正确指导和优良作风，不仅在当时对湖北工作的胜利开展起了重要作用，而且使湖北的干部首先是各级领导干部深受教益，对湖北后来的工作都产生了长远的良好影响。我们参加讨论这篇文章的同志热切地想说说我们的感受和体会，希望能对读者阅读《文选》时起点参阅作用；尤其希望能对湖北的同志有所裨益，以继往开来的精神把湖北的工作做得更好一些，为我们祖国“实现四化，振兴中华”的宏伟事业作出更多的贡献。
    　　　　（一）
    湖北一解放，就面临着确定工作重点的问题。实质上，这是一个如何坚持实事求是的思想路线，从湖北实际出发，创造性地贯彻中央指示精神的问题。１９４９年２月，党的七届二中全会确定党的工作重心由乡村移到城市。用乡村包围城市的时期已经完结，开始了由城市领导乡村的新时期。这从历史时期的转变来说，从全国的总体来说，无疑是正确的。具体到当时的湖北，应当怎样贯彻执行？同先念同志一起工作过的同志都知道，先念同志是个组织观念很强的人，从来都是坚决执行中央的指示的；但他也从来都不是简单地照转照搬，而是坚持调查研究，从本地实际情况出发，创造性地贯彻执行。八年抗战时期，他在远离党中央、敌人力量十分强大、而且还有国民党顽固派不断制造“摩擦”的鄂豫地区，领导新四军第五师由小到大、从弱到强地发展壮大起来，同敌人进行艰苦卓绝的斗争，很重要的就是因为他善于正确分析当时的复杂情况，创造性地运用中央的方针政策和战略原则，充分发挥了独立战斗的精神和才能。在解放后的湖北如何确定工作重点的问题上，先念同志同样发挥了这种精神。他坚定地赞成和执行当时华中局提出经中央批准的关于当前工作“以农村为重点同时又兼顾城市”的方针，并在１９４９年８月召开的湖北省第一次党代表会议上认真分析了湖北当时的客观和主观状况，深刻阐明了当时实行这一方针的必要性和重要意义。在后来历史实践的检验中，充分证明了这一方针的正确性。
    重温先念同志在这次会议上的讲话，使我们再次感到深受教益的是，他不仅分析了湖北作为新解放区，农村中的“封建统治并没有大的改变”这个重要情况，而且深刻地分析了农业在支持工业和整个国民经济发展中的重要基础作用。他指出：“湖北的城市在经济上是脆弱的，多是消费性与商业性的。城市虽有些工业，但对农村的依赖性很大……城市工业生产所需的原料和产品销售市场主要在农村。而现时农村仍然处在封建势力压榨下，农民穷困，饥寒交迫，生产无法提高，既不能提供较多的工业原料，又无较大的购买力，在这种状况下，城市经济是很难繁荣的。我们要把落后的农村变为先进的农村，把落后的农业国变为先进的工业国，必须搞好农村工作，发展农业经济。”从这个指导思想出发，先念同志亲自抓农业，坚持不懈地抓农业，特别是针对湖北水旱灾害威胁严重的情况大搞水利建设，努力为农业的稳定，发展创造必要的条件，使湖北农业不仅很快得到恢复，而且开创了蓬勃发展的好势头。现在看来，先念同志在农业问题上的认识和实践，到今天，乃至到今后，仍然具有重要的指导意义。使我们感到高兴的是，先念同志于１９５４年离开湖北后，湖北的同志始终坚持了以农业为基础的方针，把湖北建成了全国的以粮食、棉花、油料为主的重要农业基地之一，为国家作出了应有的较好的贡献。前些时党中央召开的全国农村工作会议作出了进一步大力发展农业的重要决策。我们相信在农业问题上具有好传统的湖北，一定能够认真贯彻落实中央的决策，使湖北的农业发出新的光彩。
    在恢复国民经济和“一五”时期，湖北同全国一样，在建设上取得了前所未有的巨大成就。如何正确地对待胜利，是我们面临的一个严峻考验。早在１９５１年５月省委召开的一次县委书记会议上，先念同志就尖锐地提出要“反对不切实际的空洞叫好”，严肃批评了有些同志盲目乐观、华而不实、空洞叫好的错误倾向，并要求把克服这种错误倾向作为干部思想建设中的两大问题之一来抓紧解决。先念同志是一贯坚持说老实话、办老实事、做老实人的工作态度和工作作风的。一直到后来我们湖北的同志基本上保持了这个好的作风。遗憾的是在“大跃进”的年代，我们也被胜利冲昏了头脑，在盲目乐观、急于求成的空气中，头脑发热，高指标，高估产，放“卫星”，浮夸成风。回忆起这些蠢事及其造成的危害，至今感到沉痛。１９５８年９月，先念同志视察湖北，正是我们头脑发热到了高潮的时候。他对那些浮报的“成绩”不仅没有赞扬，反而嘱咐陪他的省委负责同志要向各地泼点冷水降点温，还表扬了一位向他反映了一部分真实情况的地委副书记。后来，湖北省委在中央的领导下纠正错误时，实行了我们党的三大作风之一的自我批评的要求，认识错误、检查错误、纠正错误比较自觉一点，比较早一点，弥补了一部分损失。这里面也有着先念同志对我们的教育和帮助。去年，先念同志到湖北视察工作时，又谆谆告诫湖北的同志要牢记历史的教训，要求湖北的同志“坚决地、毫不留情地反对说假话”。湖北省委印发了他的讲话，要求全县干部认真学习，坚决照办。这种做法是很必要的。我们衷心希望湖北的干部，都把说老实话、办老实事、做老实人的要求永远铭记在心。
    　　　　（二）
    领导的责任，一是出主意，二是用干部。先念同志以“五湖四海”的胸怀，正确执行我们党的干部政策，把从四面八方汇合到湖北来的干部亲密地团结了起来，把党外的爱国朋友和才识卓著的知识分子团结到了党的周围，把一切可以团结的力量都团结起来，为湖北干部队伍的建设创立了一个好风气，打下了一个好基础。这件事情对湖北工作的重大意义，随着历史的发展而更加深刻地显示出来。在“文化大革命”的十年浩劫中，湖北省的各级领导干部表现是好的，在大的方面也是团结的，从而使湖北省能够抵制林彪、“四人帮”的一部分破坏活动，减少了工作与生产上的损失。这是对湖北省从先念同志主持工作开始的干部队伍建设的一个历史的检验。
    湖北解放后，干部来自四面八方，名副其实地是“五湖四海”。就拿参加讨论这篇文章的人来说，有五师的，有河北的，有河南的，有山西的，有山东的；有多年跟随先念同志在战场上出生入死的老部下，也有从华北、东北、华东南下到湖北才互相认识的新战友，基本上可以说就是当时湖北干部来自“五湖四海”的一个缩影。当然，我们党在干部问题上是有丰富经验的。五湖四海，任人唯贤；与人为善，治病救人；党委会上下左右之间的“谅解、支援和友谊，比什么都重要”；不仅要善于团结和自己意见相同的同志，而且要善于团结和自己意见不同的同志一道工作，等等，都是全党经验的结晶。这些原则和方法真正要做到，是不容易的，而先念同志模范地执行了党的干部政策，实践了这些原则和方法，并且发挥了他个人在团结干部上的凝聚力。
    先念同志对干部不分亲疏远近，都大公无私，一视同仁，真正把干部一律视为党的干部，不论哪个地方的干部，并且真诚肯定、欢迎同志的进步和工作成绩，因而能具体而正确处理好本地干部与外来干部的关系，老干部与新干部的关系，党内干部与党外干部的关系，团结一切可以团结的力量。他对一批原五师的老部下公开宣布：你们要从工作出发，正确估计自己，尊重外地来的同志，担任副职的要甘当副手。他尖锐地批评那种带有“山头”倾向的人说：“共产党是马列主义的党，不是帮派、小团体，不应该有‘山头’与地区之分，也不能以个人关系分亲疏。提拔干部只能以党和人民的利益为前提，决不允许搞歪门邪道”。对身居各级领导岗位的老干部，先念同志谆谆告诫他们要“甩掉功臣的包袱，清除骄傲自满情绪”，用过去那种为革命流血牺牲都不怕的精神来学习新知识和本领，适应新的工作要求；并语重心长地指出：“培养出大批的优秀新干部，是老干部的一种责任，也是一种光荣。做好了，就是为党再立一次功”。为了帮助工农出身的干部学习，先念同志积极倡导工农干部学文化，开办工农速成中学。许多从速成中学出来的同志，至今念念不忘这一段学习所给予他们的巨大教益。对于新干部，从一解放起，先念同志就十分注意大批吸收和培养，明确指出“大量选拔新干部，不但关系着目前工作任务的完成，而且关系着能否建设社会主义的问题”。湖北刚解放时，全省区以上机关的老干部不足４０００人。省委、省政府成立不到三个月，省委就创办了湖北革命大学，先念同志亲自兼任校长，培训学员１５３１６人，除中央调走３１０２人外，绝大部分都分配在本省各地、各级党政军机关和人民团体工作。这些同志后来经过长期革命斗争和建设实践的锻炼，大多数人都成为湖北各地、各部门工作中的骨干。
    先念同志还特别重视知识分子的作用。早在１９５０年的第二次省党代表会议上，先念同志就在总结报告中系统分析了知识分子问题，明确指出知识分子是革命阵营的人，“鄙视他们是完全错误的，是落后农民思想的反映。”后来１９５２年９月，他又对省委统战部关于知识分子问题的一个报告写了重要的批语，更加尖锐、深刻地指出：“我们有一部分同志，似乎认为现在中国百分之八九十的人是文盲还不够吓人，不尊重知识分子，不争取、团结、使用他们去改变这种状况。有的同志甚至以农民狭隘观念鄙视知识分子，企图用各种不正确的办法来限制他们，这是多么错误的思想！”湖北的广大知识分子，包括一大批才识卓著的专家、教授，在反右派斗争的扩大化中，特别是在“文革”的十年浩劫中，历尽磨难，备尝艰辛，但是他们忠于祖国、忠于人民事业的赤诚之心不改。到党的十一届三中全会这个伟大的历史转折之后，他们立即重新焕发青春，以令人难以置信的毅力为夺回失去的时间而奋力拚搏，许多年过半百甚至已到花甲、古稀之年的专家还怀着激动喜悦的心情加入了党组织。应当说，这也是与党的知识分子政策在建国初期的正确执行，给予了他们信心和力量分不开的。他们从解放前后的亲身经历中，坚信只有共产党才能救中国。坚信我们党一定能够纠正自身的错误，坚信党的正确的知识分子政策一定能够得到恢复和发扬。我们党不会辜负知识分子的这种可贵的信任，在党中央的正确领导下，我们广大工人、农民、知识分子一起团结奋斗，一定会迎来科教事业的春天，迎来整个现代化建设事业的新胜利。
    同先念同志一道工作，最使人感到心情舒畅的是先念同志在坚持原则的前提下，以诚待人，平等待人，宽厚待人，一片与人为善之心，从不整人。先念同志对干部的要求是严格的，该批评的就批评，有时候批评起来还是很厉害的。但是，由于他诚恳，坦率，重事实，讲政策，全面地看人，历史地看人，而且允许申辩，欢迎改正，所以，即使挨了批，还感到服气、贴心。这正是先念同志个人在团结干部上的魅力和风格。在这方面，还有一件使我们感受很深，对武汉市的工作产生过良好影响的重要事情。１９５２年初，武汉市发生了一个复杂案件，武汉市委因此被改组，中央任命先念同志兼任武汉市委第一书记和市长。当时，武汉市有不少干部惴惴不安，担心被株连；而当时也确有个别派到武汉市去的同志把问题看得很重，认为还要查处一批干部。在这种情况下，先念同志坚持对武汉市的工作进行实事求是的深入了解和全面分析，在这个基础上正式向中央写出报告，明确肯定武汉市的工作是认真贯彻执行了党的路线、方针、政策的，从而正确地保护并进一步调动了武汉市干部的积极性，不仅稳定了武汉市的工作，而且推动了武汉市的工作更加生机勃勃地向前发展。
    《李先念文选》是很值得学习的一部著作，文选中的许多重要观点和宝贵经验到今天仍具有现实的指导意义。我们这篇文章所写的认识体会的范围，仅仅限于建国初期先念同志主持湖北工作的四五年时间，而且就这一段时间来说，也只写了几点感受较深的体会。我们还将和读者们尤其是湖北的同志们一起，进一步系统地认真学习，努力从中获取更多的教益，用以提高我们的思想，改进我们的作风，指导我们的工作，为党和人民的事业作出更多的贡献。
