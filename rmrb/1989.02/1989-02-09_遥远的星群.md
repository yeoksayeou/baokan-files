	On a humid summer night, I slowly walked up to the rooftop, gazing at the twinkling stars in the sky. Memories of a small green island in the sea and the people on that island surged into my mind.

	Last summer, I climbed onto a small island that was isolated from the world. Among the crowd that welcomed me was an old soldier. We recognized each other upon meeting.

	Before that, I had seen him in civilian clothes, his right hand holding a chubby little boy about three or four years old. Behind him were a young male soldier and a young woman, like a grandfather taking his grandchildren out for a walk. However, the pale circle on his forehead and around his eyes, left by the brim of his cap, and his neatly buttoned shirt tucked into his pants, all told me unmistakably: this was an old soldier. They walked to an ancient temple, the young woman bent down and whispered something to the chubby boy, who obediently nodded and toddled into the temple. The young soldier tried to stop him, but the old man waved his hand to stop him. The chubby boy knelt on a cushion in front of the statue, clasped his hands together, and muttered something. The old man came into the temple, hugged him, and kissed his round little face in approval. In a family of two generations of soldiers, letting the child kneel and worship in a temple was truly baffling. I never expected that he was the chief engineer of the island's troops—my interview subject.

	The roar of the waves was like an endless aria. We strolled on a small path in the mountains, and Director Wang told me about their pioneering history and the interesting stories on the island. When I mentioned the incident in the temple, he laughed and said, "That day, my son and I were sending my daughter-in-law and grandson back to the mainland. My daughter-in-law wanted my grandson to pray to the gods to bless me and my son to retire early. I agreed because the temple does not worship gods but people—good people who were born on the island and did many good deeds for the locals. After my grandson finished praying, I could use the opportunity to tell their stories. My daughter-in-law listened for a long time without speaking. She is reasonable and has never explicitly asked us to leave the island. Even if she wanted to, it would be like today, in a roundabout way. I agreed to let my grandson pray to the gods to use the opportunity to do some work in the same roundabout way. She needs to understand me and my son; with understanding comes support. They are still young and should be happy and not follow my old path."

	"Follow your old path?"

	Director Wang seemed to realize he had said too much and stopped talking. His old partner, the political commissar of the unit, helped me solve the puzzle.

	Director Wang was one of the first graduates of a foreign language institute after the liberation of China. He followed the country's assignment, leaving his newlywed wife and giving up the superior living conditions in Shanghai, joining this special unit. His wife would get sick and vomit whenever she traveled by car or boat, so he never let her suffer and never asked her to come to the unit. They only saw each other for a month each year during his leave. After three years of marriage, they had no children. Unable to bear the loneliness, his wife divorced him. Ten years later, they met by chance, and she found that he was still single, feeling very guilty. She proposed to give her son from her second marriage to him. Her second husband was a professor who understood his wife and admired Director Wang, so he took his wife and son to Director Wang. The child brought joy to Director Wang's monotonous life. They quickly established a deep bond of both father and son and friends. After the child graduated from the island's school, which had only a few students but all levels from primary to high school, he followed Director Wang's advice to apply to a military academy. After graduation, he returned to the island. The only thing that made Director Wang uneasy was that the child had married a girl from the mainland.

	I still wanted to know why Director Wang did not remarry. He was silent for a long time before stammering, "Because I have always loved her." I was even more puzzled: "Then why did you divorce her?" He sighed deeply:

	"I loved her because I wanted her to be happy. Since I couldn't do that, why should I drag her down?" I thought for a moment: "At that time, you could have requested a transfer or to return to Shanghai, and the problem would have been solved." He told me: "Our generation, for some reason, just had this stubborn idea: we were raised by the party and the state, and should be assigned and chosen by the party and the state. We thought this way and acted this way."

	Several days of interviews, I was always moved by the noble character of this old intellectual. He insisted that I not write about him. He said that their living environment was indeed very harsh, with low living standards and slow promotions. The cadres working in this unit were all intellectuals, with graduates from the 1950s, student union chairs from the 1960s, and graduates from key national universities in the 1980s; they had men and women, old and young, some had worked for decades, and some had only been on the island for a few years, but they all silently did unknown work in this little-known place, and he was just like them, fulfilling the responsibilities of an ordinary intellectual to the country.

	A year has passed, and I have kept my promise not to write anything about the green island, about Director Wang and his comrades. However, the image of Director Wang often lingers in my mind, unforgettable.

　　遥远的星群
　　翯俜
    闷热的夏夜，我缓缓踱上楼顶，凝视缀饰在苍穹的闪烁的星斗，海上一个绿色小岛和小岛上的人们，也随之涌上我的记忆。
    去年酷夏，我攀上一座孤悬世外的小岛。迎接我的人群中有位老军人，见面，我们彼此认出来了。
    在那之前，有一次，我看见他身穿便服，右手牵着个三四岁的胖小子，身后跟着一位青年男军官和一位少妇，仿佛携儿带孙的老爷爷。但是，他前额至眉眼那一圈因为帽檐遮阳而留下的晕白，那扣得整整齐齐的衬衣以及衬衣下摆扎在裤子里的装束，都准确无误地告诉我：这是一位老军人。他们走到一座古庙前，少妇弯腰对胖小子低声说了句什么，胖小子乖乖地点了点头，跚跚跨进庙门。青年军官想拦阻，老人却摆手制止。胖小子在雕像前的蒲团上跪下，双手合十，小嘴念念有词。老人进庙来抱住他，并嘉许地亲了亲他圆嘟嘟的小脸。两代军人的家庭，竟让孩子跪神祭庙，真是匪夷所思。没想到，他竟是岛上部队的王总工程师——我的采访对象。
    涛啸像一曲不会终止的咏叹调。我们在山间小路上漫步，王总给我讲述他们的创业史，和小岛上轶闻趣事。我插话时候便提起在祠里看见的那件事。他笑了，说：“那天，我和我的儿子送儿媳和孙子回大陆，儿媳要孙子祈求神灵保佑我和我儿子早日转业。我同意了，因为庙里供奉的不是神而是人——岛上出生的为老百姓做了许多好事的好人，孙子拜完后我可以借机讲讲他们的故事。儿媳听了许久没有说话，她通情达理，从未明确提出要我们离开海岛，即使想，也是像今天这样委婉，我同意她让孙子去拜神，也是为了因势利导同样委婉地做做工作。得让她理解我和我儿子，有理解才会有支持。他们还年轻，应当幸福，不能再走我的老路。”
      “走你的老路？”
    王总似觉失言，不再说话了。他的老搭档，部队政委帮我解开了这个谜。
    王总是我国解放后第一代外语学院毕业生，他服从祖国分配，别离新婚妻子，抛舍大上海优越的生活条件，走进这支特殊部队的行列。他妻子无论坐车乘船，都会吐得昏天黑地，王总不让她遭罪，从不要她来部队。他们每年相会的时间只有王总探亲的一个月假期。结婚三年，没有生下一男半女。妻子忍不住寂寞，离了婚。十年后，他和她偶然相逢，她发现他仍旧孑然一身，十分愧疚，提议把自己和后夫生的儿子送给他。后夫是位副教授，理解妻子，更钦佩王总，便携同妻子把儿子送到王总身边。孩子给王总单调的生活增添了欢乐。他们很快建立了既如父子、又如朋友的深厚情感。孩子在绿岛那所只有几个学生但却小、初、高中班级俱全的学校毕业后，按王总的建议报考了军校；毕业后又回到海岛。唯一使王总感到不安的是孩子和大陆上一位姑娘结了婚。
    我还想知道王总为什么不再结婚。他沉默良久，方讷讷地说：“因为我一直爱着她。”我更奇怪了：“那你为什么要和她离婚呢？”他深深地叹了口气：
  “我爱她就是希望她幸福，既然我做不到这一点，为什么要拖累她呢？”我想了想：“当时你要求调走或转业回上海，问题不就解决了？”他告诉我：“我们这一代人，不知为什么，就认一个死理：我们是党和国家培养的，应当由党和国家来支配、挑选我们。我们确是这样想也是这样做的。”
    几天的采访，我一直感动于这位老知识分子崇高的思想品质。他坚决要求我不写他。他说，他们的生活环境诚然十分艰苦，住房等生活待遇很低，职务提拔十分缓慢。在这支部队工作的干部全是知识分子，他们有50年代大学毕业的高材生，有60年代毕业于某学院的学生会主席，还有80年代毕业的国家重点学院的学生；他们有男有女，有老有少，有的已经干了数十年，有的才上岛几年，但他们都默默地在这鲜为人知的地方做着鲜为人知的工作，而他也只是和这些人一样，尽着一位普通知识分子对祖国应尽的责任。
    一年过去了，我如约没有写下关于绿岛、关于王总和他的战友的任何文字，但是，王总的形象时常萦回脑际，无法忘怀。
