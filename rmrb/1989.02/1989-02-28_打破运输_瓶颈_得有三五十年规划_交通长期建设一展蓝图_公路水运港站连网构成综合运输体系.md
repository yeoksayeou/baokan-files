Transportation Long-Term Construction Blueprint Unveiled

Highways, Waterways, Ports, and Stations Form a Comprehensive Transportation System

Highways: 12 Main Lines Totaling Over 20,000 Kilometers

Waterways: Three Rivers and Two Rivers Along the Coast Form the Main Channels

Ports and Stations: Connecting Water and Land Lines to Form Transportation Hubs

BEIJING, Feb. 27 (Xinhua) -- Zhao Ziyang recently pointed out that economic construction requires long-term planning, and five-year plans are not enough. This is particularly important for transportation construction. Transportation construction requires large investments and long cycles, and many projects cannot be completed in the short term. They require a good 30-50 year long-term plan. This was stated by Minister of Communications Qian Yongchang at the national transportation work conference held today.

At the meeting, Qian Yongchang revealed the basic ideas for China's long-term plans for road and waterway construction: Starting from the "Eighth Five-Year Plan," over several five-year plans, under the guidance of the overall policy of developing a comprehensive transportation system, we will build the main framework of highways, the main channels of waterways, and the main hubs of ports and stations to meet the needs of national economic and social development.

The main framework of highways is: Focus on building 12 national highways with a total length of 20,000 to 25,000 kilometers, connecting major cities, industrial centers, transportation hubs, and international ports, gradually forming a national highway main line system that is compatible with the national economic development pattern, coordinated with other modes of transportation, and composed of expressways and first and second-class highways, which are fast and safe.

The main channels of waterways are: According to the distribution of China's productive forces and waterway resources, focus on strengthening the north-south maritime transportation main channel that runs through the economically developed regions along the southeast coast, taking the Yangtze River, Pearl River main lines and their main tributaries as the key, developing the Three Rivers and Two Rivers navigation, forming waterway main channels such as the coast, Yangtze River, Pearl River, and Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal, and with 1,000-ton waterways as the backbone and 300-500-ton waterways as the base, improving 30,000 kilometers of waterways, and building a navigation system that is directly connected to the main and branch lines, connected to the sea, and connected to land and water transportation.

The main hubs of ports and stations are: Focus on building coastal and inland river ports and highway transportation hubs connected to the main channels of waterways and the main framework of highways, forming a multifunctional internal and external radiation fan. The number of coastal port berths should reach 2,000. In central cities, focus on building passenger and cargo distribution hubs and service centers, forming a transfer and loading and unloading system with supporting facilities.

The long-term plan will be implemented in stages. The state will be mainly responsible for the planning and layout of national "three main" projects, construction coordination, and part of the investment subsidies; provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions will be mainly responsible for the construction of national "three main" projects in their respective regions, as well as the connection of regional transportation networks with "three main" projects.

State Councilor Zhou Jiahua spoke at the meeting, saying that at present, China's processing industry, raw material industry, and energy, transportation and transportation present an inverted triangle, causing many problems for our economic construction, and we should turn this inverted triangle over. Transportation construction should focus on key points, and preliminary work should be detailed. Once decided, we must have the spirit of either not doing it or doing it well. Do not drag on after a decision, taking 10 or 8 years to complete it.

### 打破运输“瓶颈”得有三五十年规划  交通长期建设一展蓝图  公路水运港站连网构成综合运输体系

　　打破运输“瓶颈”得有三五十年规划
    交通长期建设一展蓝图
    公路水运港站连网构成综合运输体系
    公路：主干线１２条计２万多公里
    水运：沿海三江两河形成主通道
　　港站：连接水陆干线建交通枢纽
    本报北京２月２７日讯　记者张国荣、曹照琴报道：赵紫阳同志最近指出，经济建设要有一个长远的部署，五年、五年搞不行。这对交通建设来说，尤为重要。交通建设投资大、周期长，许多项目不是短期内能够完成的，需要搞好三五十年的长期规划。这是交通部长钱永昌在今天召开的全国交通工作会上说的。
    会上，钱永昌披露了我国水路、公路建设长远规划的基本设想：从“八五”开始，用几个五年计划的时间，在发展以综合运输体系为主轴的交通业的总方针指导下，建设公路主骨架、水运主通道、港站主枢纽，以适应国民经济和社会发展的需要。
    公路主骨架是：重点建设１２条共２万至２．５万公里国道主干线，将全国重要城市、工业中心、交通枢纽、对外口岸连接起来，逐步形成一个与国民经济发展格局相适应，与其它运输方式相协调，由高速公路和一、二级汽车专用公路组成的快速、安全的国道主干线系统。
    水运主通道是：按照我国生产力布局和水运资源分布的特点，重点强化贯通东南沿海经济发达地区的海上南北运输主通道，以长江、珠江干线及主要支流为重点，发展三江两河航运，形成沿海、长江、珠江、京杭运河等水运主通道，并以千吨级航道为骨干，三五百吨级航道为基础，改善航道３万公里，建成干支直达、江海相通、水陆联运的航运体系。
    港站主枢纽是：重点建设与水运主通道、公路主骨架相连接的沿海、内河港口和公路交通枢纽，形成多功能的对内、对外辐射扇面。沿海港口泊位要达到２０００个。在中心城市，重点建设客货集散枢纽和服务中心，形成设施配套的中转换装系统。
    长远规划分阶段实施。国家主要负责全国性“三主”的规划布局、建设协调和部分投资补助；省、市、自治区主要负责全国性“三主”在本地区项目的施工建设，以及区域交通网与“三主”项目的衔接。
    国务委员邹家华在会上讲了话，他说，目前我国的加工工业、原材料工业和能源、交通运输呈一个倒三角形，给我们的经济建设带来不少问题，应该把这个倒三角形正过来。交通建设要抓住重点，前期工作要细。一旦确定，就要有这么一种精神，要么不搞，要搞就要搞成、搞好。不要决定后拖泥带水，１０年、８年搞不成。
