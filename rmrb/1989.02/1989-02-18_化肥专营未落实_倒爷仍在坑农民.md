Editor's Office: The state has clearly stipulated that fertilizers, pesticides, and agricultural films, and other agricultural materials should be monopolized. However, in Minquan and Lankao counties of Henan Province, most of the fertilizers, pesticides, and agricultural films are still being sold by multiple entities and individuals. The urea they sell is priced at 1,200 to 1,300 yuan per ton, while farmers cannot buy subsidized fertilizers and other agricultural materials from the agricultural materials supply companies.

Farmers here have already prepared sufficient funds to increase their investment in agricultural production. Therefore, farmers strongly appeal to the people's governments at all levels, in conjunction with the commercial, industrial and commercial, and tax departments, to quickly investigate and deal with those law-breaking "speculators" and to promptly implement the monopoly on fertilizers and other agricultural materials.

### 化肥专营未落实  倒爷仍在坑农民

　　化肥专营未落实    倒爷仍在坑农民
    编辑部：国家已明确规定对化肥、农药、农膜等农用物资实行专营。但是，在河南省民权、兰考两县，目前化肥、农药、农膜等农用物资大部分仍是多家经营和个体经营。他们售出的尿素每吨价格竟高达１２００元至１３００元，而农民在农业生产资料公司根本买不到平价化肥等农用物资。
    这里的农民早已备足了资金，用于增加对农业生产的投入。因此，农民强烈呼吁：各级人民政府会同商业、工商、税务等有关部门迅速查处那些不守法的“倒爷”，尽快对化肥等农用物资实行专营。
