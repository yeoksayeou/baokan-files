Yesterday at 9:30 PM, after just finishing watching the live broadcast of the China-Mongolia football match, the phone rang. A reader from Tianjin called with a long-distance call to ask about the match result. It turned out that the Central Television used the second channel for the broadcast, and they couldn't receive it there. Shortly after, calls came in from various places, all long-distance, all asking who won.

The level of Chinese football is not high, and participating in the World Cup qualifiers, the prospect of advancing from the group stage is not optimistic. However, there are still so many fans with such high enthusiasm, which is truly a fortunate thing for Chinese football. By the way, viewers in Beijing who can watch the live broadcast also called, saying that the commentary during the match was too verbose and inappropriate, spoiling the mood. In fact, compared to so many fans outside the capital who couldn't watch the broadcast, they are already fortunate.

The Chinese team has just made its debut in the World Cup qualifiers, and there are still many more matches ahead, which are even more important. It is said that all of them will have television broadcasts. The Chinese team should play better and better, and undoubtedly the fans who are paying attention to the matches will also increase their enthusiasm. Fans across the country are hoping that Central Television will not favor the capital or a few major cities, and also hope that the commentators will take this opportunity to improve their commentary skills, just as they hope that the football players will not let people down.

　　世界杯题外话
    本报记者  汪大昭
    昨晚９点半，刚刚看完中孟足球赛电视转播，电话铃声即起，一位读者从天津打来长途，询问比赛结果。原来中央电视台用第二套节目转播，他们那里收不到。俄顷，各地又有不少电话，都是长途，也是问谁赢了。
    中国足球水平不高，参加世界杯外围赛，小组出线的前景都不乐观，却依然有如此之多的球迷以如此之高的热情关注，实在是中国足球的幸事。顺带说一句，北京地区能够看到电视转播的观众，也有电话打来，认为球赛转播解说员絮絮不休的“评述”言多语失，太刹风景。其实，比起那么多看不到转播的外地球迷来，他们已经是身在福中了。
    世界杯外围赛中国队刚刚亮相，后面的赛事还多，也更重要，据说都有电视转播。中国队应当越踢越好，想必关注比赛的球迷们也会随之将热度升温。全国的球迷们盼着中央电视台不再偏爱首都或少数几个大城市，也希望解说员们乘此大好机会提高一下说球水平，正如他们盼着足球健儿不再让人失望。
