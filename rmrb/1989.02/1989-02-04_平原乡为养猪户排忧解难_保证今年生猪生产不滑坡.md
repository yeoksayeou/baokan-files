Editor's Note:
The letters published here send a signal that needs attention: in some places, the price of piglets has fallen, and there are signs of selling sows. If not handled properly, pig production may decline again.

Pork is related to every household's "basket of vegetables" and is closely related to people's lives. Therefore, for the problems that have emerged in pig production, our leaders at all levels and relevant departments must not be complacent. They should formulate corresponding measures based on local actual situations to protect farmers' enthusiasm for pig farming. The practices of the Anqiu County Party Committee and government in Shandong, as well as the Pingyuan Township in Changle County, to protect farmers from selling sows are indeed wise, and other places can try them.

Pingyuan Township Helps Pig Farmers Alleviate Difficulties to Ensure Pig Production Does Not Decline

In 1988, Pingyuan Township in our county produced 17,000 fattened pigs, averaging 2.8 pigs per household. After winter, due to the rise in market grain prices and the fall in piglet prices, some farmers planned to sell their sows, and others planned to sell their fattened pigs before the Spring Festival and not raise pigs next year. The main reason for this phenomenon is that farmers believe that the cost of raising pigs has increased and it is not economically viable. To address this, the Pingyuan Township Party Committee and the township government have taken the following measures for pig production in 1989:

First, encourage farmers to raise sows. The township regulations stipulate that for every sow retained, 150 kilograms of subsidized corn will be provided from the township's self-raised grain; for those that give birth to piglets before and after the Spring Festival, 100 kilograms of subsidized corn will be awarded per litter. Second, allocate feed land or feed grain. Starting from 1989, each household raising one fattened pig will be allocated one unit of feed land by the village; villages that do not allocate feed land will provide 100 kilograms of corn per pig by the end of the year. This fundamentally ensures the source of concentrated feed. Third, appropriately arrange grazing time. Local pigs have the habit of eating grass. The township plans to organize grazing for two to three months after spring, which can save about 70 kilograms of feed per pig.

The above measures have been gradually implemented. Currently, the township has 1,457 sows, which can produce more than 30,000 piglets this year. Over 1,000 mu of feed land has been allocated. The township plans to raise 29,000 pigs this year, with an average of 1.15 pigs per person, slightly more than last year.

### 平原乡为养猪户排忧解难　保证今年生猪生产不滑坡

    编者按：这里刊登的一组来信，给人们发出了一个值得注意的信号：一些地方仔猪价格下跌，宰割母猪的现象开始露头。搞得不好，生猪生产将再次出现“滑坡”。
    猪肉关系到家家户户的“菜篮子”，与人民生活息息相关。因此，对生猪生产中出现的带有苗头性的问题，我们的各级领导干部、各个有关部门切不可麻痹大意，应根据当地实际情况，制定相应的措施，保护农民的养猪积极性。山东安丘县委、县政府以及昌乐县平原乡保护农民养母猪的做法不失为明智之举，其它地方不妨一试。
　　平原乡为养猪户排忧解难　保证今年生猪生产不滑坡
    １９８８年，我县平原乡出栏肥猪１．７万头，户均２．８头。入冬后，由于市场粮价上涨，仔猪价格下跌，有的农户计划卖掉母猪，有的则计划在春节前卖出肥猪后，明年不再养猪了。出现这一现象的主要原因是，农民认为养猪成本加大，经济上不合算。为此，平原乡党委、乡政府对明年的生猪生产采取了以下措施：
    一是鼓励农民饲养母猪。乡里规定，每留１头母猪，从乡自筹粮中补助１５０公斤平价玉米；春节前后产仔猪的，每窝奖售１００公斤平价玉米。二是划分饲料地或给饲料粮。从１９８９年开始，农户每养１头肥猪，村里划给一分饲料地；不划分饲料地的村，年底每头猪给１００公斤玉米。这就从根本上保证了精饲料的来源。三是适当安排放牧时间。本地猪有吃青草的习惯。乡里准备开春后，组织牧猪两三个月，这样，每头猪约可节省饲料７０公斤。
    上述几条措施，已陆续开始落实。现在，全乡有母猪１４５７头，今年可产仔猪３万多头，饲料地已划了１０００多亩。全乡今年计划养猪２．９万头，人均１．１５头，比去年略有增加。
