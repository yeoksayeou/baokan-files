The Bhutto family, spanning two generations, has made tireless efforts to develop Sino-Pakistani relations.

Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the father of the current Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, visited China six times during his lifetime, making him one of the foreign leaders who visited China the most frequently. He once said with deep emotion: "The relationship between the People's Republic of China and Pakistan is built on a solid foundation and has withstood the test of time. The Pakistani and Chinese peoples understand each other, and we are good friends. The Pakistani people will continue, as always, to develop our friendship in the cause of world peace based on justice."

Prime Minister Bhutto had a deep friendship with Chinese leaders, especially Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Chen Yi. In February 1964, when Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Chen Yi visited Pakistan, then Foreign Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto accompanied them throughout the visit and hosted a family dinner for Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Chen Yi and their spouses, introducing his entire family to the guests. After the dinner, they took a group photo to commemorate the occasion. These precious photos are preserved in the National Archives of Pakistan.

During his various visits to China, Prime Minister Bhutto met with Chairman Mao on multiple occasions. In her recently published autobiography "Daughter of the East," Benazir Bhutto recalls: "My father often praised the Chinese revolution and its leader Mao Zedong, who led the Red Army to climb snow-capped mountains and cross grasslands, overthrowing the old society... As a personal gift, Mao Zedong gave my father a cap, which is still hanging in his dressing room." This was a cap from the Liberation era. In the collection of national leaders' photos at the Pakistani Archives, there are precious photos of Prime Minister Bhutto wearing this cap on various occasions. In May 1976, Prime Minister Bhutto made his final visit to China. Despite his advanced age and frail health, Chairman Mao still received him at Zhongnanhai, making him the last foreign leader Chairman Mao met before his passing.

On January 8, 1976, after the news of Premier Zhou's death was announced, Prime Minister Bhutto immediately issued a statement, expressing deep sorrow and high praise for Premier Zhou. The statement said: "The passing of Premier Zhou Enlai has deprived Pakistan of a reliable friend. His consistent concern for our people and his deep support for the cause of Pakistan will forever be remembered by us. The Pakistani people, together with the Chinese people, deeply mourn this great loss. During the years when Premier Zhou Enlai guided the relationship between China and Pakistan, we forged a strong friendship that has withstood the test of changing circumstances. I have no doubt that this friendship will continue to endure."

Prime Minister Bhutto's wife, Nusrat Bhutto, was also a social activist. In the 1960s and 1970s, she accompanied Prime Minister Bhutto on three visits to China.

On September 17, 1988, shortly after Nusrat Bhutto returned to Pakistan from her long treatment in London, she attended the reception held by the Chinese Consulate General in Karachi to celebrate China's National Day on September 30. The next day, Nusrat Bhutto flew from Karachi to Islamabad to attend the reception held by the Chinese Embassy in Pakistan to celebrate China's National Day.

After Benazir Bhutto, then 35, won the elections last year, the first foreign envoy she met was the Chinese ambassador. During that meeting, Benazir Bhutto informed the Chinese ambassador that the President and the Chief of the Army Staff had agreed to form a government led by the People's Party. On December 8, Benazir Bhutto met with the Chinese ambassador again at the Prime Minister's office in Rawalpindi and expressed her intention to further promote Sino-Pakistani friendship during her term. She clearly stated that after performing the Hajj in Saudi Arabia according to Islamic customs, China would be the first country she would officially visit as Prime Minister.

In the 1970s, Benazir Bhutto accompanied her father on several visits to China. The long history, brilliant culture, and friendly people of China left her with beautiful memories. She fondly recalls the scenes from that time: when visiting the Great Wall, she and her siblings ran so fast that the security personnel, fearing they might have an accident, closely followed them, while they laughed heartily...

The friendly relations between China and Pakistan have been developed through the joint efforts of the Chinese government and successive Pakistani governments, as well as the peoples of both countries. The Bhutto family has contributed significantly to this effort.

　　布托一家与中国
    任毓骏
    布托一家两代人，对发展中巴关系做过不懈的努力。
    阿里·布托总理是现任巴基斯坦总理贝·布托的父亲，他生前曾６次访问中国，是访问我国次数最多的外国领导人之一。他曾满怀深情地说：“中华人民共和国和巴基斯坦的关系是建立在稳固基础上的，经受了时间的考验。巴基斯坦人民和中国人民相互了解，我们是好朋友。巴基斯坦人民将一如既往，在建立于公正基础上的世界和平事业中，继续发展我们的友谊。”
    布托总理和中国领导人，特别是周恩来总理和陈毅副总理有着深厚的友谊。１９６４年２月，周恩来总理和陈毅副总理访问巴基斯坦时，当时身任外交部长的阿里·布托全程陪同，并设家宴款待周恩来总理和陈毅副总理夫妇，并把全家介绍给贵宾。家宴结束后，全体合影留念。这些珍贵的照片都保存在巴基斯坦国家档案馆。
    布托总理在历次访华期间，曾多次会见毛主席。贝·布托在她前不久出版的自传《东方之女》中回忆道：“我父亲经常称赞中国革命及其领导人毛泽东，是他领导红军爬雪山，过草地，推翻了旧社会……作为个人礼品，毛泽东送给我父亲的那顶帽子就挂在他的更衣室。”这是一顶解放帽。在巴基斯坦档案馆国家领导人的影集中，保存着布托总理在各种场合头戴这顶帽子的珍贵照片。１９７６年５月，布托总理最后一次访华。当时已年迈体弱的毛主席仍在中南海会见了他，这是毛主席生前会见的最后一位外国领导人。
    １９７６年１月８日周总理逝世的消息公布后，布托总理当即发表声明，沉痛悼念和高度评价周总理，声明说：“周恩来总理的逝世使巴基斯坦失去了一位可靠的朋友。他对我国人民的一贯关心以及他对巴基斯坦事业的深切支持，使他永远活在我们心中。巴基斯坦人民同中国人民一起深切哀悼他们遭受的这一巨大损失。在周恩来总理指导中国和巴基斯坦的关系的岁月里，我们两国缔结了坚强的友谊，这种友谊经受了形势变化的考验。我毫不怀疑，这种友谊将会持久地继续下去。”
    布托夫人努斯拉特·布托也是一位社会活动家。在六七十年代，她曾３次随布托总理访华。
    １９８８年９月１７日，布托夫人长期在伦敦治病回国后不久，即在９月３０日出席了中国驻卡拉奇总领事馆举行的我国国庆招待会。第二天，布托夫人又从卡拉奇乘飞机赶到伊斯兰堡，参加了中国驻巴基斯坦大使馆举行的国庆招待会。
    ３５岁的贝·布托去年大选获胜后首先会见的外国使节就是中国大使。在那次会见中，贝·布托向中国大使通报了总统和陆军参谋长已同意由人民党组阁的情况。１２月８日，贝·布托在拉瓦尔品第总理府再次接见了中国大使，并表示在她的任期内将进一步促进巴中友谊的发展。她明确说，待按照伊斯兰教规去沙特阿拉伯麦加朝圣后，中国将是她出任总理后第一个正式访问的国家。
    ７０年代，贝·布托曾随其父数次访华，中国悠久的历史，灿烂的文化，友好的人民给她留下美好的印象。她深情地回忆起当时的情景：游览长城时，她们姐妹兄弟跑得很快，以致警卫人员担心他们出意外而紧紧追随在他们后面，而他们却开怀大笑……
    中巴两国的友好关系，是在中国政府和巴基斯坦历届政府，以及两国人民的共同努力下发展起来的。这中间，有布托一家的功绩。
