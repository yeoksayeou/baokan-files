All Soviet and foreign journalists must now obtain special passes to cover special events in the Soviet Union, otherwise they will be considered to be acting illegally.

Since the Soviet Union began its policy of openness, there have been frequent mass gatherings, parades, and other activities. Police and special forces have been deployed to suppress unauthorized activities and maintain order for legal ones. Previously, journalists had the right to freely cover these types of activities.

In January of this year, the Soviet Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Internal Affairs, and the Journalists' Association jointly issued a regulation stipulating that journalists entering areas protected by the police must hold special passes issued by the Soviet Ministry of Internal Affairs.

In today's *Izvestia*, Mikhailov, the head of the news bureau of the Soviet Ministry of Internal Affairs, spoke about this new decision, stating that issuing special passes to journalists is not a restriction on democracy but is "to create better conditions for their reporting." Journalists who hold special passes will receive assistance from Soviet Ministry of Internal Affairs personnel, police, and military personnel.

　　苏联有关部门决定
    采访特殊事件须持特别证件
    新华社莫斯科２月１２日电  所有苏联和外国新闻工作者今后在苏联采访特殊事件时必须持有特别通行证，否则将被认为是违法的。
    苏联实行公开性以来，经常出现群众集会、游行及其他活动，民警和特殊部队取缔未经批准的活动，为合法的活动维持秩序。以前，新闻工作者曾有权自由采访这类活动。
    今年１月，苏联国防部、内务部、新闻工作者协会通过一项条例，规定新闻工作者进入民警设立的保护区必须持有苏联内务部发放的特别通行证。
    苏联内务部新闻局局长米哈伊洛夫在今天的《消息报》上谈到这一新决定时指出，发给新闻工作者特别通行证不是限制民主，是“为了给他们创造更好的报道条件”。凡持有特别通行证的新闻工作者将得到苏联内务部工作人员、民警和军人帮助。
