On the first day of the Spring Festival, when everyone is in high spirits, the Henan Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government convened a meeting with leaders from 17 departments under the provincial government and the city of Zhengzhou. The meeting was held to mobilize and deploy the first important task of the new year—effectively promoting clean governance in party and government agencies.

The decision to discuss clean governance on the most festive day of the traditional Chinese New Year underscores the urgency and importance of this work. Addressing over a hundred leaders who had come to the meeting instead of celebrating with their families, Provincial Party Secretary Yang Xixue and Governor Cheng Weigao extended warm New Year greetings. They then solemnly requested that the work on clean governance begin with the leading cadres at all levels, starting with the provincial-level agencies and the capital city, and focusing on departments that have the most direct contact with the public and businesses, where corruption is most likely to occur.

Governor Cheng Weigao pointed out: Currently, some functional departments are facing serious issues such as arbitrary fees, fines, and levies. Some cadres are involved in corruption, bribery, abuse of power, and malpractice. Some department leaders are either unaware of these problems due to bureaucratism, or they know about them but are afraid to tackle them, or they themselves are leading the way in these malpractices. Therefore, if clean governance is not led by the leaders, it will only be a mere formality. At today's meeting, we first set three rules for the leading cadres: First, lead by example in fighting corruption and maintaining clean governance. What is required of the agency staff, the leaders must also adhere to; second, without explicit national regulations, do not create your own rules for the benefit of the department, using power to gain advantages; third, do not shield any cases of power abuse, corruption, or bribery in your department. Investigate and handle each case thoroughly.

The Henan Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government are determined to see the clean governance work through to the end, ensuring it is effective and produces results. Currently, the focus should be on investigating and rectifying issues that have drawn strong public complaints, such as cases of soliciting and extorting bribes, arbitrary fees, fines, levies, and forced demands. At the same time, clean governance should have a long-term plan and goals, establishing a restraint mechanism within party and government agencies. The Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government have put forward clear opinions on this, including: strengthening learning to enhance the awareness of leading cadres at all levels to promote clean governance; combining clean governance with comprehensive management; all departments should formulate work rules and procedures that are conducive to public service and supervision; establish a system for public reporting and evaluation; and establish a clean governance system.

　　河南省新春第一天抓廉政
　　领导干部“约法三章”　首先从省直机关做起
    本报郑州２月６日电  记者李而亮报道：在万民喜气洋洋的大年初一，河南省委、省政府召集省直１７个部门和省会郑州市的领导同志，动员布置新春的第一项重要工作——切实抓好党政机关的廉政建设。
    之所以选择在我国传统最热闹的节日里，讨论廉政建设这样严肃的话题，河南省委、省政府旨在突出这项工作的紧迫性和重要性。面对上百名在大年初一放弃与家人欢聚前来赴会的领导干部，省委书记杨析综、省长程维高向大家热情拜年，同时郑重拜托：要求廉政建设工作首先从各级领导干部做起，从省直机关、省会城市做起，从和群众与企业直接打交道、最容易舞弊的部门做起。
    省长程维高指出：目前，对于群众反映最大的有些职能部门乱收费、乱罚款、乱摊派现象；对于一些干部贪污受贿、贪赃枉法、营私舞弊的问题，所在部门的领导干部有的是犯官僚主义不了解，有的是了解了不敢抓，有的是领导干部带头主张干。所以廉政建设不从领导抓起，只能是走过场。今天的会上，首先对领导干部“约法三章”：一是自己带头反腐败，为政清廉。要求机关工作人员做到的，自己首先要做到；二是国家没有明文规定的，不能为本部门利益自立章法，以权力换取好处；三是对本部门发生的弄权、贪污、受贿决不能袒护，要查一件处理一件。
    廉政建设工作，河南省委、省政府决心一抓到底，落到实处，抓出成效。当前，要集中查处和纠正一些群众反映强烈的问题，即有群众举报、检举受贿索贿、敲榨勒索行为的；有权单位不给好处不办事，给了好处乱办事，甚至办坏事的；乱收费、乱罚款、乱摊派、硬索强要的等等。同时，廉政建设要有长远的规划和目标，建立起党政机关中的约束机制。省委、省政府为此提出明确的意见，包括：加强学习、提高各级领导班子抓廉政建设的自觉性；廉政建设与综合治理相结合；所有部门都要根据有利于群众办事、监督制定工作规章、程序；健全群众举报、评审制度；建立廉政建设制度等。
