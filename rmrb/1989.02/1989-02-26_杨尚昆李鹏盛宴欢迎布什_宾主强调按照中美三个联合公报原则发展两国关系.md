Yang Shangkun and Li Peng Host Banquet for Bush
Guests and Hosts Emphasize Developing Sino-American Relations Based on the Three Joint Communiqués

BEIJING, Feb. 25 (Xinhua) — State President Yang Shangkun and Premier Li Peng hosted a grand banquet at the Great Hall of the People tonight to warmly welcome U.S. President George Bush.

Yang Shangkun, in his speech at the banquet, said that President Bush's visit to China soon after taking office not only shows his importance attached to the development of Sino-American relations but also reflects his appreciation for the Chinese people.

Yang Shangkun pointed out that the Chinese government has always attached great importance to Sino-American relations. We are pleased to see that in the first decade after the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the United States, exchanges and cooperation in various fields between the two countries have made remarkable progress, laying a good foundation for the development of relations between the two countries. We hope that, on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and under the guidance of the principles of the three Sino-American joint communiqués, both sides will make greater efforts to further enhance mutual understanding and trust, fully tap the potential of relations between the two countries, and continuously expand and deepen cooperation in all areas, so that Sino-American relations can achieve greater development on the basis of the first decade.

President Bush, in his speech at the banquet, said he was very happy to return to China again. Including this visit, he has visited China five times since 1975.

Bush said, "We cherish the new relationship that has been established between our two countries. Our friendship is continuing to develop, which is good, because relations between countries must be solid, not only to handle areas of common interest but also to handle areas of disagreement."

Bush pointed out, "We remain committed to the principles established in the three joint communiqués that form the basis of our relationship. We have found a constructive and non-malicious way to discuss the Taiwan issue based on the fundamental principle of 'one China.' The United States is now concerned, and will continue to be concerned, about the peaceful resolution of differences by the Chinese people themselves."

Bush concluded, "We are also pleased with the continuing expansion of relations between your country and mine. Let us continue to work together, planting trees, so that we and your descendants can enjoy the shade together."

U.S. Secretary of State James Baker, Ambassador to China James Lilley, White House Chief of Staff John Sununu, and National Security Advisor Brent Scowcroft attended the banquet at the invitation of the Chinese side.

Chinese officials attending the banquet included Li Peng's wife, Zhu Lin; Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Rong Yiren and Fei Xiaotong; Vice Premiers Tian Jiyun and Wu Xueqian; State Councilors Li Tieying, Qin Jiwei, Wang Boqian, and Song Jian; Standing Committee members of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, including Ji Pengfei and his wife Xu Hanbing, Huang Hua and his wife He Liliang, Huang Zhen and his wife Zhu Lin, and Fang Yi.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, Feb. 25 (Reporter Xin Huai Shi) — U.S. President George Bush arrived in Beijing this afternoon for a working visit to China.

This is Bush's fifth visit to China. This time, he and his wife Barbara Bush are visiting China as guests of State President Yang Shangkun and Premier Li Peng.

Vice Premier Wu Xueqian and Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhu Qizhen welcomed Bush at the airport.

Then, Bush and his entourage, accompanied by Wu Xueqian, drove to the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse.

When Bush and his wife arrived at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse, they were greeted by Premier Li Peng and his wife Zhu Lin, who warmly shook hands and exchanged greetings.

Li Peng said to Bush, "On behalf of Zhao Ziyang, Deng Xiaoping, and Yang Shangkun, I extend a warm welcome to you."

Bush said that China has undergone tremendous changes in recent years, and he is very interested in coming to China again to learn about the new situation.

U.S. Secretary of State James Baker and others also arrived in Beijing with Bush and his wife.

President Bush departed from Tokyo's Haneda Airport this noon and flew to Beijing.

　　杨尚昆李鹏盛宴欢迎布什
    宾主强调按照中美三个联合公报原则发展两国关系
    本报北京二月二十五日讯  记者张亮、丁刚报道：国家主席杨尚昆和国务院总理李鹏今晚在人民大会堂举行盛大宴会，热烈欢迎美国总统乔治·布什。
    杨尚昆在宴会讲话中说，布什总统就职后不久就来我国访问，这不仅表明他对发展中美关系的重视，而且体现了他对中国人民的赞赏。
    杨尚昆指出，中国政府历来重视中美关系。我们高兴地看到，在中美建交后的第一个十年中，两国在各个领域里的交流和合作取得了显著的进展，为两国关系的发展打下了良好的基础。我们希望，在和平共处五项原则的基础上，在中美三个联合公报原则的指导下，我们双方共同作出更大的努力，进一步增进相互了解和信任，充分挖掘两国关系中的潜力，不断扩大和深化各方面的合作，使中美关系在前十年的基础上得到更大的发展。
    布什总统在宴会讲话时说很高兴再次返回中国。包括这次访问在内，他自一九七五年以来已先后五次访华。
    布什说，我们珍惜我们两国之间已经建立的新的关系。我们的友谊在继续发展，这是好的，因为国与国之间的关系必须稳固，不但要能处理好有共同利益的领域，还要能处理好有分歧的领域。
    布什指出，我们依然信守构成我们关系的基础的三个联合公报所确定的原则。我们根据只有一个中国的基本原则，已经找到了建设性地、不带恶意地讨论台湾问题的途径。美国现在关注，今后也关注由中国人自己和平解决自己的分歧。
    布什最后说，贵国和我国之间关系的不断扩展，也使我们感到欣慰。让我们继续协作，一起栽树，这样我们和你们的后人就能够在一起乘凉了。
    美方国务卿詹姆士·贝克、驻华大使洛德、白宫办公厅主任约翰·苏努努、总统国家安全事务助理布伦特·斯考克罗夫特等应邀出席了宴会。
    中方出席宴会作陪的有李鹏总理的夫人朱琳，人大常委会副委员长荣毅仁、费孝通，国务院副总理田纪云、吴学谦，国务委员李铁映、秦基伟、王丙乾、宋健，中顾委常委姬鹏飞和夫人许寒冰、中顾委常委黄华和夫人何理良、中顾委常委黄镇和夫人朱霖，政协副主席方毅等。
    据新华社北京二月二十五日电　（记者辛怀时）美国总统乔治·布什今天下午再一次来到他所熟悉的北京，开始对中国进行工作访问。
    这是乔治·布什第五次访华。这次他和夫人巴巴拉·布什是作为国家主席杨尚昆和国务院总理李鹏的客人来中国访问的。
    国务院副总理吴学谦，外交部副部长朱启祯等到首都机场迎接。
    接着，布什一行由吴学谦陪同驱车前往钓鱼台国宾馆。
    当布什和夫人抵达他们下榻的钓鱼台国宾馆十八号楼时，迎候在那里的国务院总理李鹏和夫人朱琳走上前去，同他们热烈握手，互致问候。
    李鹏对布什说：“我代表赵紫阳、邓小平、杨尚昆对阁下的来访表示热烈欢迎。”
    布什说，中国这几年来发生了巨大的变化，他很有兴趣再次来中国了解新的情况。
    随同布什总统和夫人来访的美国国务卿詹姆士·贝克等，也同机到达北京。
