"The pollution in Baiyangdian is severe, and it has reached a point where it cannot be ignored any longer. We must make a decision to address it and not delay any further." This was stated by Song Jian, a member of the State Council and the head of the State Council's Environmental Protection Commission, during his inspection of Baiyangdian and Baoding region over the Spring Festival.

Baiyangdian, which had been dry for five years, began to hold water again in August of last year, drawing widespread attention. Currently, the lake holds approximately 500 million cubic meters of water, but one-third of the water area has been polluted to varying degrees, with the primary source of pollution being Baoding City.

On February 8th and 9th, Song Jian, along with leaders from relevant departments and bureaus of the State Council, visited Baiyangdian for an inspection. They held a discussion with leaders from Hebei Province, Baoding Region, Baoding City, and Anxin County. Song Jian stated that there is a consensus that Baoding Region, Baoding City, and Baiyangdian are closely linked ecological systems. Currently, the situation is dire, with wastewater causing significant problems and reaching a dangerous limit. The entire city of Baoding is essentially sitting on a pool of wastewater, and the situation is worsening. Immediate action must be taken to address this issue.

Song Jian emphasized that all levels of leadership must have a sense of urgency. Such severe pollution is unbearable for the tens of thousands of people in Baoding and central Hebei. The goal should be to complete the cleanup within three years, and at the latest, within five years. This decision must be made. The principle of "polluter pays" should be adhered to as the basic guideline.

Song Jian stated that all levels of government and environmental protection departments must strengthen their management of the environment and demand that enterprises do not pollute it. This is particularly important for major polluters, which must take responsibility for their own treatment. For smaller enterprises that cannot handle treatment independently, relevant departments can undertake unified treatment and charge fees based on the proportion of pollution. The pollution situation of enterprises must be monitored and supervised. Those that fail to improve over a long period should be monitored daily, and severe cases may be required to suspend operations for rectification.

When discussing environmental legislation, Song Jian pointed out that the state already has laws for environmental protection, and provinces and cities can formulate their own regulations and rules based on their specific situations. Environmental protection must be controlled from a macro perspective.

Participants in this inspection and discussion included Li Xù'ě, Yang Zhènhuái, Qǔ Gépíng, and Sòng Shūhuá.

　　宋健考察白洋淀后强调    
    “华北明珠”污染治理刻不容缓
    本报讯  “白洋淀污染严重，已到不治理不行的时候了。要下决心治理，不要再拖了。”这是春节期间国务委员、国务院环境保护委员会主任宋健在白洋淀、保定地区调查研究后说的。
    干涸５年的白洋淀去年８月蓄水以来，引起人们的普遍关注。目前，淀内存水约５亿立方米，但有１／３水域已遭受不同程度的污染，而主要污染来自保定市。
    ２月８日和９日，宋健和国务院有关部委、局的领导同志来到白洋淀调查研究，同河北省、保定地区、保定市、安新县的负责人进行了座谈。宋健说，大家的意见相当一致，保定地区、保定市和白洋淀是紧密联系在一起的生态系统。现在是污水成灾，到了相当危险的极限，整个保定市是坐在污水上，而且还在发展，必须下决心治理。
    宋健指出，各级领导应该有紧迫感，这样的污染，保定、冀中的几十万人民承受不了。要限期３年、最迟不能超过５年治理好，要下这个决心。治理的原则还是“谁污染谁治理”。这是基本的原则。
    宋健说，各级政府和环境保护部门要强化对环境的管理，理直气壮地要求企业不污染环境。特别是一些排污大户必须自行进行治理，一些小的企业不能独立治理的，有关部门可统一治理，按排污比例收费。对企业排污情况要监测、监督，长期治理不好的要天天监测，严重的可以停产整顿。
    当谈到环境立法问题时，宋健指出，国家已经有了保护环境的法律，省市还可以根据自己的情况制订法规、条例。要从宏观上对保护环境进行控制。
    参加这次调查和座谈的有李绪鄂、杨振怀、曲格平、宋叔华等。
