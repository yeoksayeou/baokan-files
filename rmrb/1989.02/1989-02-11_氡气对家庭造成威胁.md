Radon gas poses a threat to some households in Britain, according to a report in the Daily Telegraph.

Radon gas is a radioactive gas that is naturally released from rocks, particularly from granite. The presence of radon gas increases the risk of lung cancer, and it is estimated that 1,500 people in Britain die each year from lung cancer caused by radon gas.

According to a survey of 121 areas, the number of households affected by radon gas is more than double what was previously thought. The radon gas problem is mainly concentrated in Cornwall and Devon in Britain, where approximately 50,000 households exceed the safe standards for radon gas.

    新华社伦敦电  据《每日电讯报》报道，氡气对英国一些家庭造成了威胁。
    氡气是从岩石，特别是从花岗岩中，自然放出的一种放射性气体。氡气增加了得肺癌的危险，英国每年有１５００人死于氡气引起的肺癌。
    根据对１２１个地区的调查，受氡气威胁的家庭比原先认为的增加一倍多。氡气问题主要集中在英国康沃尔和德文地区，这两个地区大约有５万个家庭超过了氡气的安全标准。
