Since the summer of last year, Yugoslavia has experienced a severe drought that has lasted for several decades. There was no rain in the autumn, and there was little snow in the winter. The water levels in rivers and reservoirs have been steadily decreasing, leading to a significant reduction in electricity generation at hydroelectric power stations. River navigation and residential water supply have also been affected.

According to a report by the Yugoslav News Agency, when water resources are abundant, each hydroelectric power station in Yugoslavia can generate over 100 million kilowatt-hours of electricity per day. However, due to water scarcity, they can now only generate 25 million kilowatt-hours per day. Currently, the Djerdap hydroelectric power station's electricity generation is only one-third of its maximum capacity. Since last week, Yugoslavia has been importing 10 million kilowatt-hours of electricity per day. Montenegro and Slovenia have already started to restrict electricity use, and Bosnia and Herzegovina are also preparing to take similar measures. The power companies in the south believe that if it does not rain in the next one or two weeks, there will be an electricity supply crisis. Therefore, they have appealed to residents to conserve electricity.

The water level of the Sava River, the largest river in Yugoslavia, has been continuously decreasing. Due to the low water level, the cargo capacity of ships has significantly decreased, and some river sections are even impassable. Dock workers have been forced to take 45 days of leave.

In the coastal and karst regions of Slovenia, due to the prolonged drought, residents are facing difficulties in obtaining drinking water. The Yugoslav News Agency reported today that nearly 100,000 residents rely on water tankers for their drinking water.

Due to the prolonged lack of rain, the soil in the Vojvodina Autonomous Province, a major grain-producing area in Yugoslavia, lacks moisture, directly affecting the normal growth of winter crops.

### 秋无雨冬缺雪久旱不解  南斯拉夫水源危机造成严重困难

　　秋无雨冬缺雪久旱不解    
    南斯拉夫水源危机造成严重困难
    新华社贝尔格莱德２月１２日电  （记者徐坤明）由于长期干旱，南斯拉夫的河流和水库的水位日益下降，致使水电站的发电量显著减少，内河航运和居民饮水也发生困难。
    去年夏季以来，南斯拉夫发生了数十年未遇的旱灾，秋天无雨，冬天缺雪。
    据南通社报道，南斯拉夫各水电站在水源充足的情况下每昼夜可发电１亿多度，但现在因水源匮缺每昼夜只能发电２５００万度。目前铁门峡水电站的发电量仅相当于最大发电量的１／３。从上周起，南斯拉夫每天需进口１０００万度电。黑山和斯洛文尼亚两个共和国已开始限制用电，波斯尼亚和黑塞哥维那共和国也准备采取类似措施。南各电力公司认为，如果一两周内再不下雨，电力供应将发生危机，因此已向居民发出尽量节省用电的呼吁。
    南斯拉夫最大的河流萨瓦河的水位近来一再下降。由于水位太低，货轮的载货能力大大下降，有些河段甚至无法通航，码头工人已被迫休假４５天。
    在斯洛文尼亚共和国的沿海地区和喀斯特地区，由于久旱无雨，居民饮水发生了困难。南通社今天报道说，将近１０万居民的饮用水需靠水罐车供应。
    由于长期未下透雨，南斯拉夫产粮区伏伊伏丁那自治省的土壤缺乏水份，直接影响到越冬作物的正常生长。
