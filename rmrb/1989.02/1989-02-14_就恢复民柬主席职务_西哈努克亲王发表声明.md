Norodom Sihanouk, on February 12, released a statement in which he discussed his decision to resume the chairmanship of the Democratic Kampuchea. He said, "In the current situation, as a patriot, I have the responsibility to take the helm again, so that I can do my best to enable the Cambodian national resistance forces to regain national independence and save Cambodia."

In his statement, Sihanouk reminded the international community that over 100,000 Vietnamese immigrants have already settled in Cambodia and are "concretely making Cambodia Vietnamese." He also noted that "Vietnamese soldiers disguised as Khmer soldiers have been infiltrated into the so-called Hun Sen Cambodian army." He added that all departments, administrative organs, and both domestic and foreign policies of the Hun Sen-Heng Samrin regime are strictly controlled and directed by Vietnam.

Sihanouk urged the international community not to believe the propaganda that Vietnam will withdraw all its troops by the end of September 1989 or by 1990.

　　就恢复民柬主席职务    
    西哈努克亲王发表声明
    新华社北京２月１３日电  诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王２月１２日在这里发表的一项声明中谈到他决定恢复民主柬埔寨主席职务时说，在当前形势下，“作为一个爱国者，我有责任重新掌舵，以便尽我所能，使柬埔寨民族抵抗力量有可能重新赢得民族独立，拯救柬埔寨”。
    西哈努克亲王在声明中提醒国际社会注意：现在已有１００多万越南移民在柬埔寨定居，并且“正具体地使柬埔寨越南化”；“冒充高棉士兵的越南军人已被安插进所谓的洪森柬埔寨军队”；洪森—韩桑林政权的各个部门、行政机关及其内外政策均受越南的严格控制和指挥。
    西哈努克要求国际社会不要轻信越南将在１９８９年９月底之前或１９９０年全部撤军的宣传。
