At a time when the entire nation is striving to achieve new heights in grain production, a significant problem has emerged in the Heilongjiang Reclamation Area, a key commercial grain base in China: nearly ten thousand tractors are lacking essential spare parts, severely impacting winter maintenance.

The Heilongjiang Reclamation Area, which comprises 101 mechanized state farms, currently has 45% of its tractors and 35% of its combine harvesters operating beyond their service life. Consequently, nearly ten thousand tractors require maintenance and part replacements each winter. However, the agricultural machinery maintenance work over the past two years has frequently been disrupted due to a shortage of spare parts. Many parts are unavailable in the market and cannot be ordered from the manufacturers. According to incomplete statistics, this year alone, the 9,241 Dongfanghong 54 and 75 model tractors in the entire reclamation area that need maintenance are short of 58 types and 110,000 spare parts.

Due to the severe shortage of agricultural machinery spare parts, 850 tractors have been dismantled but cannot be reassembled. Statistics show that, as of now, only 30% of the planned tractor maintenance and 27% of the agricultural machinery maintenance tasks have been completed in the entire reclamation area. Leaders of relevant departments in the reclamation area are deeply concerned, stating: "If this situation continues, not only will it be difficult to achieve new heights in agricultural production this year, but even normal production may be at risk!"

　　黑龙江垦区冬检遇难题    
    万台拖拉机缺少零配件
    据新华社哈尔滨２月１０日电  （通讯员高淑华）在全国为粮食生产登上新台阶而积极努力之际，我国重要商品粮基地黑龙江垦区却碰到了令人忧虑的问题：目前，全垦区有近万台拖拉机因零配件短缺，冬季检修受到严重影响。
    拥有１０１个机械化国营农场的黑龙江垦区，目前已有４５％的拖拉机和３５％的联合收割机在超期服役。因此，每年冬季都有近万台拖拉机需要检修、更换零配件。然而，近２年的农机具检修工作却经常受到零配件短缺的干扰。有不少零配件在市场上买不到，到生产厂家也订不到货。据不完全统计，今年全垦区需要检修的９２４１台东方红５４和７５两种型号的拖拉机，就缺少５８个品种、１１万个零配件。
    由于农机零配件严重短缺，目前全垦区有８５０台拖拉机拆开后无法安装。据统计，到目前为止，全垦区拖拉机只完成应检修计划的３０％，农机具也只完成应检修任务的２７％。垦区有关部门的领导忧心忡忡地说：这样下去，不要说今年农业登上新台阶，连正常的生产也难保证！
