Training Senior Personnel Management Officials
Personnel Management Theory and Technology Research Class Opens in Beijing

According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, (reporter Chen Yan) Liu Ze Peng, vice minister of the Organization Department of the Communist Party of China and director of the China Senior Personnel Management Officials Training Center, said at the opening ceremony of the personnel management theory and technology research class held on the 20th that China's organizational and personnel management needs modernization and scientific advancement.

Liu Ze Peng said that as the reform deepens and construction develops, many defects and malpractices in China's organizational and personnel management system are increasingly exposed. The main issues are over-concentration of management authority, outdated and single management methods, and an incomplete management system lacking legal framework.

This research class is organized by the China Senior Personnel Management Officials Training Center. Its purpose is to effectively train a group of personnel management officials and researchers who have both practical experience and modern personnel management knowledge and skills, thereby promoting the reform of China's personnel system and the development of personnel management.

This session of the research class has 44 students, who are officials and researchers from central government agencies, central state agencies, and provincial and municipal organization and personnel departments.

The China Senior Personnel Management Officials Training Center will invite more than 20 experts and scholars from the United States, Switzerland, France, Hong Kong, and other countries and regions, as well as experts and scholars from some Chinese universities and research institutions, to teach various personnel management courses over the course of one year.

Vice Minister of the State Personnel Department Cheng Lianchang, Deputy Representative of the United Nations Development Programme Office in Beijing Bao Shitao, and a student representative each spoke at the opening ceremony. Vice Minister of the Organization Department Lv Feng and others attended the opening ceremony.
