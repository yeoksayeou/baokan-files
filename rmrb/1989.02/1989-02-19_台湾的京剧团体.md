In Taiwan, there are four privately-run Peking opera troupes.

The first is "Ya Yin Xiao Ji," led by Guo Xiao Zhuang, known as the "reformer of Taiwanese Peking opera." Guo Xiao Zhuang is a disciple of the Mei School and greatly admires the art of Zhang Jun Qiu and Du Jin Fang from the mainland. However, in their performances, they do not simply replicate the old plays from the Mei and Zhang schools. Instead, they specialize in "new-style Peking opera." Guo Xiao Zhuang believes that Peking opera must adapt to the tastes of young audiences, so both the content and form need significant improvements. Their troupe's production of "Bai She and Xu Xian" focuses on strengthening Xu Xian's role, aiming to help modern young men and women find their own reflections in the theme of "love."

The second troupe is "Dang Dai Chuan Qi." This troupe advocates for selectively adapting Western plays into Peking opera. They have already staged productions like "Desire City," based on Shakespeare's "Macbeth."

The third troupe is "Sheng Lan Tuan," founded by Ma Yu Qi, who came from the mainland. Ma Yu Qi was influenced by the famous Peking opera actor Ye Sheng Lan. Therefore, this troupe specializes in performances where the young male lead takes the main role, such as "Qi Shuang Hui" and "Liang Zhu."

The fourth is the "Jing Tu Chuan Bo Gong Si," established by Xu Zhong Fei in 1985. This company has taken a unique approach by focusing on the production of television Peking opera programs, integrating traditional stage performances with innovative television techniques. This has opened a new path for Taiwanese Peking opera. They have recently produced the television Peking opera "Hudie Meng" (Butterfly Dream).

　　台湾的京剧团体
    在台湾，有４家私人主办的京剧团。
    第一家是以有“台湾京剧革新家”之称的郭小庄为首的“雅音小集”。郭小庄是梅派青衣，十分崇尚大陆的张君秋、杜近芳艺术。但演出中又不照搬梅、张两大流派老戏，而是专演“新派京剧”。郭小庄认为，京剧一定要设法适应青年观众，所以从内容和形式都须大力改进。他们团所演的《白蛇与许仙》，致力加强许仙的戏，希望现在的男女青年，都能在“爱情”这一点上，从戏中找到自己的踪影。
    第二家是“当代传奇”剧团。该团主张有选择地将西洋戏剧改成京剧。已上演过的戏有根据莎士比亚《马克白斯》改编的《欲望城国》等。
    第三家是由来自大陆的马玉琪组建的“盛兰剧团”。马玉琪曾受过著名京剧小生叶盛兰影响。所以这个团专演小生挑大梁的戏，如《奇双会》、《梁祝》等。
    第四家是徐中菲于１９８５年创办的“精图传播公司”。这家公司独辟蹊径，专门搞京剧的电视节目制作，将舞台传统与影视创新溶为一体，为台湾京剧杀开一条新路，现又出品电视京剧《蝴蝶梦》等。
