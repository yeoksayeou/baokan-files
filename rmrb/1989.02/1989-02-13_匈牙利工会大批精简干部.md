Hungary's Trade Unions Significantly Reduce Staff

The Executive Committee of the National Council of Trade Unions of Hungary recently decided to reduce the staff of the provincial-level trade union councils by 50% and the staff of the National Council by 30%.

According to a report in the Hungarian trade union newspaper "People's Voice" on the 11th, this decision was made in the spirit of reforming the trade unions.

The National Congress of Hungarian Trade Unions held last December decided that the primary task of the Hungarian trade unions in the future is to defend and represent the interests of workers. This has made the tasks of the trade unions more explicit, thereby reducing many administrative affairs and making it possible to streamline the trade union staff.

Next, the responsibilities and independence of various levels of trade unions in Hungary, especially professional and grassroots trade unions, have significantly increased. As the central-level trade union leadership organization—the National Council of Trade Unions—gradually develops into a federation, it is no longer necessary to retain as many staff members.

After the streamlining, the National Council of Trade Unions of Hungary will have only 200 people, including 120 political cadres and 80 technical and administrative personnel.

　　匈牙利工会大批精简干部
    匈牙利工会全国理事会主席团最近决定，将州一级的工会理事会的干部精简百分之五十，全国理事会的干部精简百分之三十。
    据匈工会报纸《人民之声报》十一日报道，上述决定是本着改革工会的精神作出的。
    去年十二月召开的匈工会全国代表会议决定，今后匈工会的主要任务是捍卫和代表工人利益。这就使工会的任务更加明确，从而减少了许多行政事务，使精简工会干部成为可能。
    其次，匈各级工会、尤其是专业性工会和基层工会的责任感和独立性大大增强。作为中央一级的工会领导机构——工会全国理事会逐步朝联合会的方向发展，因而也没有必要保留更多的干部。
    精简后的匈工会全国理事会只有二百人，其中政治干部一百二十人，技术和行政人员八十人。
