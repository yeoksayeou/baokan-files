Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze arrived here this morning. He told reporters at the airport that he would discuss the Afghanistan issue and bilateral cooperation with Pakistani leaders during his visit.

The Soviet foreign minister said that all Soviet troops in Afghanistan would be withdrawn by February 15, and he would discuss with the Pakistani side how to best restore peace and stability in Afghanistan.

Shevardnadze is the highest-ranking Soviet official to visit Pakistan in more than 20 years.

Currently, the Afghan resistance forces are preparing for the first meeting of the Consultative Council, which is scheduled to be held in Pakistan on February 10. This meeting will approve the formation of an interim Afghan government to replace the Kabul regime and manage Afghanistan after the withdrawal of Soviet troops.

The Soviet Union insists that members of the ruling party in Kabul should be included in the future Afghan government.
