At noon today, someone fired a gun at a painting in the "Chinese Modern Art Exhibition" at the National Art Museum of China in Beijing. A man and a woman suspected of the crime have been detained for investigation.

A spokesperson for the Beijing Public Security Bureau said that the two young people detained are students at the Academy of Fine Arts. They admitted to creating the incident, stating that they believed the artwork was imperfect and should be "destructive art." Their actions disrupted the order of a public place, and they have been detained for investigation.

The painting that was shot, titled "Dialogue," was created by the female suspect. The artwork depicts a man and a woman talking on the phone.

After the shooting incident, the male suspect was apprehended by the crowd on the spot, and the female suspect was arrested by public security personnel at 5 PM. The spokesperson for the Beijing Public Security Bureau said that no one was injured in this incident. The public security authorities are currently investigating the case.

　　中国美术馆发生枪击展品案件
　　涉嫌的一男一女已被拘留审查
    新华社北京２月５日电  （通讯员马卫东、记者黄智敏、李志高）今天中午在北京中国美术馆有人对正在展出《中国现代艺术展》的一幅画开枪射击。涉嫌的一男一女已被拘留审查。
    北京市公安局发言人说，被拘留的这两个青年都是画院的学生。他们承认制造了这一案件，原因是他们认为这幅作品不完美，应该有“破坏性艺术”。他们的行为扰乱了公共场所的秩序，因而被拘留审查。
    这幅被射击的题为《对话》的作品的作者，就是涉嫌制造这一案件的两人中的女青年，画面是一男一女正在通电话。
    这一开枪案件发生后，男青年被群众当场抓获，女青年于下午五时被公安人员抓获。
    北京市公安局发言人说，在这一案件中无人受到伤害。公安机关正在对此案进行查处。
    这个展览是今天上午开幕的。事件发生后，展有《对话》的展厅已暂时关闭。
