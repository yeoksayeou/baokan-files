While many eyes are focused on the coastal regions, the Loess Plateau welcomed a Hong Kong businessman. The spirit of the farmer-entrepreneurs moved him, and the budding market captivated him. He spoke to the people about the attraction of Western China.

On January 12, the reporter had a chance encounter with Mr. Liu Ruijiang, Director and General Manager of the Hong Kong Community Service Center, in Xi'an. Through a lively conversation, the rich attraction of Western China was vividly described.

"I am a Hong Kong native," Mr. Liu said. "After graduating from university, I started my business, opened shops, and established factories. I became the Director and General Manager of the Hong Kong Community Service Center. I also have two unrelated jobs: member of the Hong Kong Basic Law Consultative Committee and member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

"You ask why I came to Shaanxi? It was fate. In Guangdong, Zhuhai, and Macau, I have collaborated with local people to establish enterprises. There are still many people in the mainland who want me to invest. They say their factories, workers, and equipment are all ready, but these are not important! What attracted me to this ancient cultural city is a farmer from Jingyang County in your province, a prominent figure in the reform wave, the farmer-entrepreneur Chen Yuanjie."

"The inland yellow earth of China is not inferior to the coastal regions; each has its own advantages." Liu Ruijiang patted the color television beside him and said, "Like this large item, if you assemble it and sell it abroad, Guangdong is certainly stronger than the inland regions. Just the transportation alone can earn a lot of money, that's the coastal advantage! But you all know, the transistors and triodes inside this thing are only the size of soybeans, yet they are imported in large quantities every year. The bosses who produce these small items are drooling over the large market in mainland China, but we often overlook the market advantages around us.

"One of your farmers, a leader of a thousand workers, Chen Yuanjie, and I get along very well. The 'coastal economic strategy' cannot be rushed. It's not cost-effective to seek far when you have what you need nearby. We cooperate in the electronics industry. Chen's company is a township enterprise with fewer bosses and a more flexible mechanism. This is my first investment in Shaanxi, and I chose a township enterprise; in other places in the mainland, I also chose township enterprises. I feel that state-owned large enterprises generally have the phenomenon of being 'too big.' For example, when introducing technology, they invest in a production line worth tens of millions of yuan, which is impressive and grand, but in reality, they are just processing factories. No one pays attention to or wants to do small things like electrolytic capacitors. They are not approved year after year, but they are imported in billions, which is quite ridiculous.

"I am a businessman, and from a businessman's perspective, I can't talk about grandeur and how to report to superiors. I have to talk about benefits, about investing less money to produce more profitable goods. Of course, I am not just a businessman. From a macro perspective, out of China's 1 billion people, 800 million are farmers, and township enterprises are their great creation. Seeing the potential of the West, you can say it's my personal insight; choosing to cooperate with township enterprises, you can say it's my personal interest. But more importantly, my partner and I have a common language. To put it bluntly, I am in Hong Kong, and the enterprise is in the mainland, thousands of miles apart. How can this director possibly 'know everything'? Without a common language in business philosophy, management, development, and understanding of the political situation, there won't be cooperation.

"I admire farmer-entrepreneurs. Shaanxi, you should see this as a long-closed region. The farmer-entrepreneurs here have all gone through unimaginable hardships. I won't be polite and say that if there are 300,000 to 500,000 yuan of personal property in mainland China, one can live a comfortable life for a lifetime. Chen Yuanjie could have easily made a fortune and lived a comfortable life. But I see them still struggling because these entrepreneurs have ideals that I admire. I also see many people helping them because they have ideals that many people entrust to them. This is truly a powerful force!

"The final question is whether I have confidence in the investment prospects? You all know that the external environment for township enterprises is changing, and unpredictable factors make it very difficult for enterprises to operate. Many small and medium-sized enterprises are forced to adopt short-term behaviors. However, I believe that the 1990s will be the peak of China's repayment to the world, and more joint ventures and foreign exchange-earning enterprises will be needed to contribute."

    当众多目光投向沿海的时候，黄土高原接待了一位香港客商。农民企业家的精神使他动容，广薄初萌的市场使他倾心。他向人们大谈——中国西部的吸引力
     中国西部的吸引力
     吴宝臣　南峰
    １月１２日，记者在西安与香港社团服务中心的董事、总经理刘迺强先生巧遇，一番畅谈，中国西部那浓郁的吸引力，叫他说了个有滋有味。
    “我是个香港仔”，刘先生说，“大学毕业以后‘打天下’，有了商店，有了工厂，成了香港社团服务中心的董事、总经理。还有两个与生意人无关的差事：香港基本法咨询委员会委员和全国政协委员。
    “你问我为什么来陕西？有缘呵。广东、珠海、澳门，我都和当地人合办了企业。内地还有更多的人找我投资，说他们的厂房现成、工人现成、设备也现成，可这些并不重要！吸引我来你们这座文化古城的，是贵省泾阳县一位农民，一位改革大潮中涌现出来的风云人物，农民企业家陈元洁。”
    “中国内陆的这块黄土地，并不比沿海差，各有各的优势。”刘迺强信手拍拍身边的彩色电视机说：“像这样大体积的东西，拼装一下往外卖，广东当然比内地强，光运输就能得一大笔钞票，沿海优势呀！可你们都知道的，这玩意里头的二极管、三极管，只有黄豆粒大，却年年大批进口。生产这些小玩意的老板，对中国内地这个大市场馋得咽口水，我们自己却往往忽视身边的市场优势。
    “你们一位农民，一位领导上千工人的企业家陈元洁，和我很谈得来。‘沿海经济战略’不能一窝蜂地搞。舍近求远，就不划算了。我们在电子行业方面合作，陈的公司是乡镇企业，婆婆少，机制活。我在陕西投资是头一次，找的是乡镇企业；我在国内其它地方投资，也都找的是乡镇企业。我觉得国营大企业普遍存在着“好大”的现象，比如引进，一搞就是几千万元一条生产线，体面呀，气派啦，实际上是给人家做加工厂，像电解电容那样的小玩意没人看得上，没人愿意干，总也不过关，却成１０亿计地大批进口，这就很可笑了。
    “我是个商人，从商人的观点看，就不能讲风光气派，讲怎么向上级报功，要讲效益，讲投少一点钞票，生产出赚钱不少的东西。当然，我也不完全是商人，从宏观上看，中国１０亿人里有８亿农民，乡镇企业是他们的伟大创造。能看到西部的潜力，你可以说是我个人的心得；找乡镇企业合作，你可以说是我个人的兴趣。但是，更重要的我和合作伙伴有共同语言。说句笑话，我在香港，企业在内地，相隔千里，我这个董事怎么可能‘事事都懂’？没有在经营思想、管理、开拓发展以及对政治大势上大体一致的共同语言，就不会有合作的默契。
    “我喜欢农民企业家。陕西，你们应当看到这是一个长期封闭的地域，这里的农民企业家，个个都是在难以想象的困难中摔打过的。我不客气地说，中国内地如果有３０—５０万元个人私产，一辈子也吃不完。陈元洁就完全可以弄一笔钱去过他的“小康”。但是我看到他们还在奋斗，因为他们这些企业家有让我钦佩的理想。我也看到很多人在帮助他们，因为他们身上有这很多人寄托的理想。这，真是一股很强的力量呵！
    “最后一个问题是问我对投资前景有信心吗？你们都知道的，乡镇企业外部环境多变，不可预见的因素给企业经营造成困难极大。很多中小企业被迫采取短期行为。但是我相信，９０年代是中国对世界的还贷高峰，需要更多的合资企业、创汇企业做贡献。”
