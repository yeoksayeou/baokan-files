	Organizational Appraisals Are No Joke

	For some time, I have noticed that many units, when filling out appraisal forms for employees who are being transferred out, only mention strengths and never weaknesses. At most, they add a few hopes.

	For example, some time ago, a company, in order to solve the problem of excess personnel, had the manager announce at a meeting: Anyone who wishes to leave the company will be allowed to do so. The appraisal for those leaving will be done in consultation with the individual, until they are satisfied. Based on the manager's promise, every employee who left this company became a "hardworking and dedicated" "model worker."

	Recently, a certain unit needed to transfer in an employee due to work requirements. After this employee was transferred in, their performance was completely different from the appraisal given by their original organization. A comrade who works in personnel said with regret: Nowadays, appraisals are hard to distinguish between true and false, making people worried!

	I believe that this abnormal phenomenon violates the principles of personnel management. A unit, a level of organization, when appraising an employee, should adopt a serious and responsible attitude and cannot treat it as a joke.

### 组织鉴定不是儿戏

　　组织鉴定不是儿戏
    一段时间以来，我发现不少单位在填写调出人员的鉴定表时，只讲优点，不讲缺点，最多加几点希望。
    例如，前些日子，一家公司为解决人员超编问题，经理在大会上说：凡愿调出本公司者，单位一律放行，调出鉴定与本人见面，达到满意为止。根据经理的允诺，这个公司每个调出人员，都成了“工作能力强，任劳任怨”的“先进者”。最近，某单位因工作需要调入一名职工，这个职工调入以后，表现与原组织的鉴定判若两人。一位搞人事工作的同志感慨地说：现在的鉴定真假难辨，叫人担心！
    我认为这种不正常的现象，是违背人事管理原则的。一个单位，一级组织给职工做鉴定，应当本着严肃、负责的态度，不能视同儿戏。
