Nuclear experts have clarified misconceptions about the Dayawan Nuclear Power Plant, stating that there are no active fault lines within a 20-kilometer radius of the plant. At a press conference held in Shenzhen for journalists from Shenzhen and Hong Kong on February 26, Gao Yunlong, the general manager of the Guangdong Nuclear Power Joint Venture Company, refuted recent sensational reports in Hong Kong newspapers about a "new fault line" near the Dayawan Nuclear Power Plant.

It is understood that the construction of the Dayawan Nuclear Power Plant, including design, equipment manufacturing, and on-site civil engineering, is in its peak phase. Major equipment for the nuclear island and conventional island will be completed this year. To ensure the quality and safety of the nuclear power plant's construction, the project has implemented a quality management system with planned and systematic controls. An independent quality assurance department, separate from the plant's operations and contracting, is composed of 39 Chinese and foreign experts. This department has conducted 1,065 inspections and supervisions of the quality activities related to the nuclear power plant's design, equipment manufacturing, and on-site civil engineering.

　　核电专家澄清外界误传
    大亚湾附近无断层
    本报深圳２月２６日电  记者王楚报道：“在大亚湾核电站周围２０公里以内，没有发现能动断层。”在昨天举行的深圳、香港记者新闻发布会上，广东核电合营公司总经理咎云龙否定了香港报纸最近渲染一时的在大亚湾核电站有“新断层”报道。
    据了解，大亚湾核电站工程设计、设备制造、现场土建施工均进入高峰期，核岛、常规岛主要设备今年将完成制造和组装。为保证核电站建设的质量和安全，核电站建设实施了一项有计划和有系统控制的质量管理体系，独立于核电站经营、承包工程之外的质量保证部，有中外专家３９人组成，对核电设计、设备制造、现场土建工程质量活动共进行１０６５次检查和监督。
