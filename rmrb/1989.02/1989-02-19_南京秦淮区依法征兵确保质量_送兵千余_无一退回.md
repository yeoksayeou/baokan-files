Nanjing's Qinhuai District ensures quality in legal recruitment of soldiers, sending over a thousand soldiers without a single return.

	New recruits from Qinhuai District, Nanjing, have all met the standards set by the military, with none being sent back. Between 1980 and 1987, the district sent over 1,200 new recruits to the military, all of whom were qualified. Among them, 235 have grown to become officers. Their specific practices for legal recruitment are as follows:

	(1) Changing the method of annual recruitment to strengthening daily propaganda and education. The district's military affairs department, in collaboration with propaganda and judicial departments, uses opportunities such as visiting military families, organizing militia, and registering for military service to widely propagate knowledge about the military service law, making citizens understand that serving in the military is a duty;

	(2) Treating the legal recruitment of soldiers as an important part of learning and applying the law, formulating recruitment work standards based on legal provisions;

	(3) Establishing a system of rewards and punishments for recruitment work according to the law.

　　南京秦淮区依法征兵确保质量   
    送兵千余　无一退回
    新华社南京２月１８日电  （记者揭衍珍）南京市秦淮区依法做好征兵工作，确保兵员质量。
    秦淮区是江苏省征兵工作先进单位。从１９８０至１９８７年，这个区向部队输送新兵１２００多名，质量全部合格，无一名退兵，其中２３５人在部队成长为干部。他们依法征兵的具体做法是：
    （一）变一年一度突击征兵的方式为加强日常宣传教育工作。区人武部门在宣传、司法部门的配合下，利用节假日慰问军烈属、民兵整组、兵役登记等机会，广泛宣传兵役法知识，使公民懂得依法服兵役是应尽的义务；
    （二）把依法做好征兵工作作为学法用法的一个重要内容，依据法律条文制订征兵工作规范；
    （三）依照法律建立征兵工作奖惩制度。
