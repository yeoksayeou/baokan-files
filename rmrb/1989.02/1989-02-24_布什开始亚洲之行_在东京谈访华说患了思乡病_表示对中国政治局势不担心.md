	Bush Begins Asia Tour
	In Tokyo, Talks About Visiting China, Says He Has Homesickness
	Expresses No Concern Over China's Political Situation

	People's Daily, Washington, February 22 – Correspondent Zhang Qixun reports: U.S. President Bush departed from Washington today aboard Air Force One, heading to Tokyo, beginning his first Asia tour since taking office.

	President Bush will attend the funeral of Japan's Emperor Hirohito on February 24 and then visit China for two days starting on February 25, followed by a visit to South Korea.

	En route to Tokyo, Bush made a brief stop in Alaska where he spoke about his Asia tour. He said, "The United States is a Pacific nation, and this visit will demonstrate that the United States is willing to continue being a Pacific nation." He also said, "I hope that U.S.-China relations will develop in a friendly, stable, and enduring manner. This relationship is more than just symbolic; it is the foundation of America's balanced foreign policy." U.S. officials stated that the purpose of Bush's visit is to show that the United States will continue to actively participate in Asian affairs.

	People's Daily, Tokyo, February 23 – Correspondent Yu Qing reports: U.S. President Bush held talks with Japanese Prime Minister Takeshita this afternoon. When discussing U.S.-China relations, Bush said, "This visit to China is my fifth since leaving Beijing in 1975. It feels like I have homesickness. I have no concerns about China's political situation."

	Takeshita expressed that Japan-U.S. cooperation in supporting China's open policy is very important. The progress in Sino-Soviet relations, as we discussed in Washington, is not a cause for concern.

	Regarding the Cambodian issue, Takeshita said, "For the peace and stability of Asia, it is necessary to resolve the issue politically. To this end, Japan, ASEAN countries, and the United States need to play a more active role. Japan and the United States should also closely consult with each other in the future."

	Bush said, "I share the same sentiment. During my stay in Tokyo, I will meet with relevant individuals and have discussions. We should support the position of Prince Sihanouk."

	Both sides also exchanged views on international issues of common concern.

　　布什开始亚洲之行
    在东京谈访华说患了思乡病
    表示对中国政治局势不担心
    本报华盛顿２月２２日电  记者张启昕报道：美国总统布什今天乘空军一号总统座机离开华盛顿抵达东京，开始他就任总统后对亚洲的第一次访问。
    布什总统在２月２４日参加日本裕仁天皇葬礼后，将于２５日前往中国访问两天，然后前往南朝鲜访问。
    在飞往东京途中，布什总统在阿拉斯加作暂短停留时谈到他的亚洲之行。他说：“美国是一个太平洋国家，这次访问将表明美国愿意继续是一个太平洋国家。”他还说：“希望美中关系友好、稳定和持久地向前发展。并有着比象征主义更为重要的内容，这种关系是美国外交政策平衡的基础。”美国官员称，布什访问的目的是要向人们表明，美国将继续积极参与亚洲事务。
    本报东京２月２３日电　记者于青报道：美国总统布什今天下午同日本首相竹下举行了会谈。在谈到美中关系时，布什说，我这次访问中国，是１９７５年离开北京后第五次，好像是患了思乡病。我对中国政治形势没有任何担心。
    竹下表示，日美合作，支持中国的开放政策是很重要的。中苏关系取得进展，正像我们在华盛顿会谈时所说的那样，不是令人担心的事情。
    在谈到柬埔寨问题时，竹下说，为了亚洲的和平和稳定，有必要政治解决。为此，日本、东盟各国和美国有必要发挥更积极的作用。日美之间今后也应该紧密协商。
    布什说，我也抱有同感。在东京逗留期间，我将同有关人物会晤，进行交谈。应支持西哈努克亲王的立场。
    双方还就共同关心的国际问题交换了看法。
