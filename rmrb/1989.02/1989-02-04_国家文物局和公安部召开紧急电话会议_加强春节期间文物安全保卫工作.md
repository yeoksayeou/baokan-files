The State Administration of Cultural Heritage and the Ministry of Public Security held an emergency telephone conference yesterday afternoon, requiring all cultural relics units across the country to strengthen security during the Spring Festival, ensuring that no thefts or fires occur.

The conference was chaired by Vice Minister of Public Security Yu Lei. Zhang Deqin, Director of the State Administration of Cultural Heritage, and others reported that in the first 25 days of January, Henan, Hubei, Gansu, Sichuan, and Hebei provinces experienced a total of five cases of cultural relics theft, with over 100 items stolen. The most serious case involved the theft of 0.5 square meters of Yuan Dynasty murals from Cave 465 of the Mogao Caves in Dunhuang, which has had a very negative impact both domestically and internationally.

The conference pointed out that these incidents clearly indicate that cultural relics crimes are still rampant. The situation is severe, and the task of protecting cultural relics is arduous. Cultural relics and public security departments must coordinate their efforts, taking a highly responsible attitude towards the state and the people to fulfill their duty of protecting cultural relics. The conference emphasized that during this year's Spring Festival, regardless of the effort and dedication required, we must maintain vigilance around the clock to ensure the safety of cultural relics.
