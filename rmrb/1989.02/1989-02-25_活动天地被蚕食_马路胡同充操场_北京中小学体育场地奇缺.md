No matter who does it, or for what reason, seizing the playgrounds where children exercise is unacceptable.

At a recent meeting on Beijing's sports work, Vice Mayor Zhang Baifu firmly stated that the issue of middle and primary school sports facilities being encroached upon and misappropriated cannot be taken lightly. Those that can be returned should be returned, and those that cannot be returned must be compensated for. However, some attendees at the meeting were skeptical about whether this promise could be fulfilled.

Before June 1983, 110,000 square meters of sports facilities in Beijing's middle and primary schools had been encroached upon and misappropriated. Under the intervention of the municipal government, more than 8,000 square meters were returned in less than a year, but at the same time, an additional 108,000 square meters were occupied. By 1988, the area of playgrounds was still being gradually eroded. In the urban area, 151 out of 301 primary schools conducted physical activities on streets or alleys. The entire 16,000 square meters of playground at Xian'erlu Primary School in Xuanwu District has been occupied by an external unit for construction materials, and for the past three years, all physical education classes, inter-class exercises, and extracurricular physical activities for the entire school have been suspended, leading to a noticeable decline in students' physical fitness.

It is predicted that in the next few years, Beijing's middle and primary schools will face another enrollment peak, and the contradiction of more students and fewer playgrounds will become even more pronounced.

　　活动天地被蚕食　马路胡同充操场
    北京中小学体育场地奇缺
    本报北京２月２４日讯  记者汪大昭报道：不管是什么人，也不管以什么理由，争抢孩子们锻炼身体的一块操场，于心何忍？
    记者在近日召开的北京市体育工作会议上听到，副市长张百发态度坚决地表示，中小学体育场地被挤占和挪用的问题不能含糊，能退还的要退还，难以退还的必须付出补偿。但是，一些与会者对这一许诺能否实现将信将疑。
    １９８３年６月以前，北京市中小学体育场地被挤占和挪用了１１万平方米。在市政府的干预下，不到一年的时间退还了８０００多平方米，同时又新占了１０．８万多平方米。直至１９８８年，操场面积仍被不断蚕食。城区３０１所小学中，有１５１所的体育活动在马路或胡同里进行。宣武区阡儿路小学１６００平方米的操场全部被外单位占用施工堆料，三年来，全校学生体育课、课间操和课外体育活动全部停止，学生体质明显下降。
    据预测，今后几年内，北京市中小学将再次出现入学高峰，学生越来越多、操场越来越小的矛盾会更加突出。
