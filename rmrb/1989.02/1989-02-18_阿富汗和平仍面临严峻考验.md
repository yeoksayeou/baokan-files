From the perspective of Afghanistan's domestic situation, after the Soviet troops withdraw, the process of restoring domestic peace in Afghanistan will face new and severe challenges in the coming period.

Firstly, although the Soviet Union has terminated its direct military intervention policy, its military influence has not been completely eliminated. Before the withdrawal, it airlifted a large number of military weapons and equipment to the Kabul regime; after the withdrawal, it will continue to promise military aid to the Kabul regime. The United States has also announced that it will not stop providing military weapons to the Afghan resistance forces. In this way, the two countries, the Soviet Union and the United States, will respectively support the two opposing forces in Afghanistan, which may lead to military confrontation between them, and this is what people are very concerned about.

At the same time, the various political forces in Afghanistan have fundamental differences on the core issue of power distribution in the future government. The Soviet Union and the Kabul authorities demand that the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan should have a place in the future "national reconciliation government"; while the basic stance of the resistance forces is that the People's Democratic Party should hand over power and step down. The positions of both sides are far apart. After the Soviet troops leave, the Kabul regime still has a certain military strength. The opposing forces are roughly balanced, and neither side has a clear advantage. If the current political consultations on establishing the future government break down, it may be difficult to avoid further military confrontation.

The recent movements of the various Mujahideen organizations that have bravely resisted foreign aggression have attracted the attention of the international community. Recently, I was invited to participate in the international discussion on the Afghan issue held in Tehran. The Iranian side invited the current chairman of the Seven Party Alliance based in Pakistan, Mujaddidi, and the former chairman, Rabbani, to attend. The Iranian leaders held talks separately with them and the leaders of the Eight Party Alliance based in Iran, calling for the elimination of differences and strengthening unity, and achieved some results. The Seven Party Alliance and the Eight Party Alliance have decided to set up offices in Tehran and Peshawar respectively to strengthen coordination between the two sides. However, there are differences between the two sides on how to establish a new Afghan government. The main points involve the following: whether the Sunni Seven Party Alliance and the Shiite Eight Party Alliance should form a unified leadership core; the allocation of seats in the consultative council, with the Eight Party Alliance demanding an increase in the number of seats; some Mujahideen organizations support the return of the former King Zahir Shah to play a political role, while others oppose it. Mujaddidi's call to avoid "mutual slaughter" seems to have a basis in reality.

The affairs of Afghanistan should be resolved by the Afghan people themselves. People hope that the various political forces in Afghanistan will prioritize the national and ethnic interests, through political consultations, form a united government that reflects the balance of power within Afghanistan, has broad representation, and is acceptable to all parties.

　　阿富汗和平仍面临严峻考验
    中国现代国际关系研究所研究员  李尧声
    从阿富汗国内情况来看，苏军撤出后，阿富汗恢复国内和平的进程今后一段时间，将面临新的严峻的考验。
    首先，苏联虽然终止了直接的军事干预政策，但其军事影响并未完全消除。撤军前，它向喀布尔政权突击空运了大批军事武器和装备；撤军后，它将继续承诺对喀布尔政权的军事援助。美国也宣布，不停止对阿富汗抵抗力量提供军事武器的援助。这样，苏美两国以这种形式分别支持阿富汗对抗的两派力量，很可能导致它们之间的军事对抗，这是人们非常担忧的。
    与此同时，阿富汗各派政治力量在未来政府的权力分配这个核心问题上存在原则分歧。苏联和喀布尔当局要求，阿富汗人民民主党在未来的“民族和解政府”中应有一席之地；而抵抗力量的基本主张是人民民主党交出政权下台。双方的原则立场相距甚远。苏军撤离后喀布尔政权还有一定军事实力。对立双方的力量大体平衡，任何一方都不占明显上风。如果目前围绕建立未来政权的政治磋商破裂，各方继续进行军事较量也许难于避免。
    英勇抗击外来侵略的阿各派圣战者组织近来的动向为国际社会所瞩目。最近，我应邀参加了在德黑兰召开的阿富汗问题国际讨论会。伊朗方面邀请了基地在巴基斯坦的七党联盟现任主席穆贾迪迪和前任主席拉巴尼等与会。伊朗领导人分别同他们和基地在伊朗的八党联盟领导人举行会谈，呼吁消除分歧，加强团结，取得了一些成果。七党联盟和八党联盟已决定分别在德黑兰和白沙瓦设立办事处，加强双方的协调。但双方在如何建立阿富汗新政权上却存在分歧。主要涉及以下几点：逊尼派七党联盟和什叶派八党联盟是否应成立统一的领导核心；建立协商议会的席位分配，八党联盟要求增加名额；有的圣战者组织赞成前国王查希尔回国，在政治上发挥作用，有的则反对。穆贾迪迪呼吁避免“互相残杀”，看来并非空穴来风。
    阿富汗的事情要由阿人民自己解决。人们希望，阿各派政治力量以国家民族利益为重，通过政治协商，组成一个符合阿国内力量对比、有广泛代表性的、各方都能接受的联合政府。
