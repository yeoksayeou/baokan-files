Tianjin Railway Bureau prioritizes the provision of empty cars for coal transportation from Shanxi, even at the cost of reducing its own income. From the beginning of this year to February 20th, they have provided 143,000 empty cars, exceeding the plan by 2,633 cars.

It is understood that clearing one car only brings in 20 yuan in income, while loading one car increases the income by an average of 530 yuan. Facing the nationwide coal shortage, Tianjin Railway Bureau considers the bigger picture, strengthens unloading capacity, and prioritizes the release of empty cars to support coal transportation from Shanxi.

　　天津超供空车支援晋煤外运
    本报天津２月２３日电  天津铁路分局宁可减少收入，也为晋煤外运提供空车。从今年元旦到２月２０日，已提供１４．３万多辆，超计划２６３３辆。
    据了解，排空一辆车只得２０元收入，而装一辆车则平均增加收入５３０元。面对全国煤炭告急的形势，天津分局顾全大局，加强卸车能力，优先发放空车，支援晋煤外运。　　　　　　　　（张福纯）
