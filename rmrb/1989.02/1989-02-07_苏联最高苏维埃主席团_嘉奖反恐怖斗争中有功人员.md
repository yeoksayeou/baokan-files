The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR has honored 27 individuals for their outstanding contributions in the fight against terrorism.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 5th: In the struggle against the terrorist hijacking, 27 individuals who saved 30 students have recently been honored by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR.

In early December of last year, four bandits attempted to use 30 fourth-grade students from School No. 41 in Ordzhonikidze, North Caucasus, as hostages to extort a plane to flee the country. During this anti-terrorism operation, 24-year-old teacher Yefimova remained calm and resourceful, skillfully negotiating with the bandits to ensure the safety of the children. Colonel Serebryakov of the Stavropol Krai State Security Committee demonstrated self-sacrifice by volunteering to replace a child as a hostage. With the close coordination of all relevant Soviet authorities, this three-day anti-terrorism operation concluded with the capture of all the bandits.

　　嘉奖反恐怖斗争中有功人员
    据新华社莫斯科２月５日电  在反恐怖劫持的斗争中拯救了３０名学生的２７名有功人员，最近受到苏联最高苏维埃主席团的嘉奖。
    去年１２月初，４名匪徒企图把苏联北高加索奥尔忠尼启则市第４１中学４年级的３０名学生当作人质，胁迫当局提供飞机让他们逃亡国外。在这一反恐怖斗争过程中，２４岁的班主任叶菲莫娃临危不惧，机智地同匪徒周旋，保护孩子们的安全。斯塔夫罗波尔边疆区国家安全局军官谢列梅捷夫发扬自我牺牲精神，甘愿顶替孩子充当人质。在苏联各有关方面的密切配合下，这场持续３天的反恐怖斗争终于以匪徒全部落网而结束。
