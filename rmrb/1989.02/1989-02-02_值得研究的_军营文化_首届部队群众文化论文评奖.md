Edition: 3

The "cultural fever" in the academic world has spread to the military camps, and "military camp culture" has become a new term on the lips of political work cadres in the army. The General Political Department's Cultural Department recently held the first military camp mass culture essay competition in Beijing, showcasing the good momentum of "military camp culture" advancing simultaneously in practice and theory.

The Political Department Propaganda Section of the General Logistics Base Command proposed that "military camp culture" should not be simply understood as some form of cultural entertainment activity in the military camp, or merely as some political and cultural educational function of the military camp; "military camp culture" is a set of values and behavioral norms adapted to the special lifestyle of soldiers, as well as certain military systems and organizations. The long-term peaceful environment and the rise of the commodity economy have created a strong contrast between "military camp culture" and folk culture, weakening its cohesive force. How to maintain soldiers' sense of belonging and loyalty has become a new topic in the open era. Their essay, along with four others, won the excellent essay award. Another 10 essays received essay awards.

　　值得研究的“军营文化”
    首届部队群众文化论文评奖
    本报讯  知识界的“文化热”开始蔓延到军营，“军营文化”成为挂在部队政工干部嘴边的新名词。总政文化部日前在京举办首届部队群众文化论文评奖，展示了“军营文化”从实践到理论同步推进的良好势头。
    总后基地指挥部政治部宣传处的卢江林、陈万仕提出，不能简单地把“军营文化”理解为军营的某种文化娱乐活动，或者仅仅看作军营的某种政治、文化教育功能；“军营文化”是一种与军人特殊生活方式相适应的价值观念和行为准则，以及一定的军事制度和组织。长期的和平环境和商品经济的兴起，使“军营文化”和民间文化形成强烈的反差，它的凝聚力有所弱化。如何保持军人的归属感、忠诚感，成为开放时代的新课题。他们的论文和其它４篇论文获得优秀论文奖。另有１０篇获论文奖。
