	Zhu Xuefan and others issue a warning to society:
	Prevent AIDS and STDs before they occur

	Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 17 (Reporter He Ping) During the sixth session of the Standing Committee of the Seventh National People's Congress, Vice Chairman Zhu Xuefan and others discussed the issues of AIDS and STDs, issuing a warning to society and hoping that measures will be taken promptly to prevent potential problems.

	During the group discussion on the draft of the Infectious Disease Prevention and Control Law, Vice Chairman Zhu Xuefan said that AIDS is currently one of the most significant threats to human health. According to the World Health Organization, AIDS is prevalent in 142 countries and regions, with 5 to 10 million people infected.

	He said that China cannot be complacent about this. With the increasing frequency of international exchanges, the possibility of AIDS entering the country is very high. Therefore, it is suggested to use all propaganda channels to widely publicize and popularize basic knowledge about AIDS. At the same time, strengthen the monitoring of AIDS, and conduct serum tests on incoming personnel to strictly control the epidemic.

	Commissioner Tao Dazong expressed similar concerns: if China does not take decisive measures to combat STDs early, the consequences will be unimaginable. It is suggested that special provisions be made in the Infectious Disease Prevention and Control Law.

	Commissioner He Mianfen believes that AIDS should be classified as a Category A infectious disease. She said that, globally, AIDS is more serious than cancer.

　　朱学范等向社会提出忠告    
    对艾滋病性病应防患于未然
    新华社北京２月１７日电  （记者何平）全国人大常委会副委员长朱学范等在七届全国人大常委会第六次会议上，就艾滋病和性病问题，向社会提出忠告，希望尽快采取措施，防患于未然。
    在分组审议传染病防治法草案时，朱学范副委员长说，艾滋病目前已成为对人类健康威胁最大的疾病之一。据世界卫生组织报告，全世界已有１４２个国家和地区流行艾滋病，已有５００万至１０００万人感染了艾滋病。
    他说，我国决不能对此掉以轻心，随着国际交往的不断增多，艾滋病传入的可能性极大。为此，建议利用一切宣传途径向群众广泛宣传和普及艾滋病的基本知识。同时，加强对艾滋病的监测工作，对入境人员应做血清检查，以严格控制疫情。
    陶大镛委员表示了同样的忧虑：倘若我国对性病不及早果断地采取措施，坚决取缔卖淫，后果将不堪设想。建议在传染病防治法中对此作出特殊规定。
    何浣芬委员认为，应当把艾滋病列入甲类。她说，就世界而言，艾滋病比癌症更严重。
