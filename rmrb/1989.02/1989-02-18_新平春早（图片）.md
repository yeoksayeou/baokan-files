The Yunnan Province Xinping Yi and Dai Autonomous County has introduced a new variety of wheat suitable for mountainous regions, which can be harvested around the Spring Festival. This variety, known as dryland wheat, has been promoted in over 9,400 mu of impoverished mountainous areas, with the highest yield reaching 500 kilograms per mu. The top image shows Yi farmers harvesting wheat with sickles.

The left image depicts Yi farmers reclaiming over 1,000 mu of high-yield farmland that had been occupied by sugarcane for many years, and planting early-season double-crop rice.
