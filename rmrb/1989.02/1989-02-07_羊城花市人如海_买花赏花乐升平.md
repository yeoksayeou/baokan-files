The Guangzhou flower market, which closed at 2 a.m. this morning, saw over 3 million people buying and admiring flowers over the course of three days, setting a new record for attendance.

Seven flower market sites were set up within the city, featuring peach blossoms, mandarin oranges, roses, chrysanthemums, cockscomb, peonies, gladiolus, and imported flowers such as carnations and violets, along with thousands of other varieties, creating a sea of blossoms in full bloom.

"Every year the flowers are similar, but the people are different." This year's flower market in Guangzhou was particularly bustling with both flowers and people. According to relevant departments, on the first day, over 200,000 people visited the busiest flower market. On New Year's Eve, more than 2,000 people entered the market every minute, truly a scene of the entire city flocking to the flower market to buy and admire flowers in celebration of peace.

At midnight on New Year's Eve, in the bustling Yuezhu Flower Market, a family of five generations was spotted. The elderly man, holding a bouquet of vibrant flowers, was pushed through the crowd, laughing heartily, "In this prosperous era, the flower market is thriving. I've never seen so many flowers and people before. It's just a pity that the prices of the flowers are higher than in previous years." The younger generations, carrying peach blossoms and lanterns, squeezed through the crowd, saying, "Market prices are rising, so it's natural that the flower market would follow suit. This is the law of value. Although the prices of the flowers are higher, they are still affordable, so everyone buys flowers to bring home and add to the spring colors, wishing for an even better year ahead." This reflects the healthy mindset and confidence in the future of Guangzhou people after a decade of reform and opening up.

　　羊城花市人如海　买花赏花乐升平
    本报广州６日电  记者梁兆明报道：今天凌晨２时闭幕的广州除夕花市，一连３天，买花赏花人逾３００万人次，盛况空前。
    市区内设有７个花市点，桃花、桔果，牡丹、菊花、鸡冠、芍药、剑兰，以及引进的康乃馨、紫罗兰等奇花艳卉，异国奇葩，数千上万个品种汇成花的海洋，争妍斗丽。
    “年年花相似，岁岁人不同”。今年羊城除夕花市，花多人也多。据有关部门测算：第一天在最热闹的花市点，买花赏花人就超过２０万人次，除夕之夜每分钟进入花市的超过２０００人次，真是万民空巷逛花市，买花赏花庆升平。
    除夕之夜１２时，在地处繁华闹市的越秀花市，遇上祖孙三代的５口之家。老者高举艳丽鲜花让人流推着走，乐呵呵地说：“盛世花市旺，从未见过这次那样花多人多，只可惜花的价钱比往年贵。”儿孙辈扛着桃花、吊钟在人流中边挤边说：“市场物价上升了，花市哪会例外？这是价值规律。花的价钱是贵了，还是买得起的，所以人人都买花回家添春色，祝愿明年更美好。”这是改革开放１０年广州人的健康心态和对前途的信心。
