The army is a fighting collective, not a clinic, nor a reformatory. The army needs young people who excel in morality, intelligence, and physical fitness. The recruitment for this year is about to begin, and military leaders are calling for:

The country needs fine young men

Reporter Luo Tongsong

In recent years, outstanding young people from all over the country have been sent to the army, and overall, the quality of soldiers in the People's Liberation Army has been improving year by year. However, there are still some places that have been careless, recruiting unqualified young people to serve in the army, causing many difficulties for the army.

There is "water" in the "educational level." In 1988, a certain infantry regiment received 433 new recruits who listed their educational level as "high school graduates" on their enrollment forms. The regiment asked a local high school to help test these recruits, and the result was that only 4% passed, while 37% scored 0. The anti-aircraft missile unit has complex weapons and high technical requirements. The higher authorities allocated 80 "high school graduates" to a battalion. The battalion leaders tested them with questions from the third year of junior high school, and only 7 people barely passed. They had to spend time giving these recruits remedial classes. A new soldier in a certain artillery platoon listed his educational level as "high school graduate" on his enrollment form, and the leader assigned him to the command platoon. However, he couldn't even solve "15 + 8 = ?". An army without culture is a stupid army. In today's era of rapid military technological development, whether it is the air force, navy, missile troops, communication troops, or infantry, all need soldiers with a high level of education to master the weapons and complete the missions. A reporter asked a soldier who was illiterate, "You clearly can't read or write, why did you fill in 'high school graduate' on the form?" This soldier replied nonchalantly, "In our county, everyone does this. The form is filled out by yourself, whatever you write is what it is. I can't write, so the form was filled out by my dad and my cousin."

Political quality is still worth paying attention to. A certain unit received 150 new recruits last year, and it was found that a considerable number of them had engaged in fighting, gambling, theft, and hooliganism before enlisting, among whom 14 had been detained by the public security authorities. A fugitive murderer, a criminal whose sentence had not been completed, and the leader of a gang of hooligans all managed to enter the army and wear military uniforms. Among the 46 new soldiers with bad habits in a certain regiment, half were members of the Communist Youth League. It was found that many members of the Communist Youth League were hastily recruited when they enlisted. A certain infantry company received 28 new recruits last year, of whom 25 joined the league between September and October 1987 during the recruitment period. A member of the Communist Youth League wrote an application to join the league, filled out a form expressing his intention to join, the branch discussed the matter, and the higher-level league committee approved it, all in one day.

Deaf and sick people also became soldiers. A new soldier in a certain regiment often stumbled at night. A doctor examined him and found that his left eye had a vision of 0.6 and his right eye only 0.2; a new soldier in a certain platoon went to the artillery shooting range to watch the artillery fire, and most of the new soldiers covered their ears when the first two shells were fired. One new soldier, however, was unmoved, and it turned out that he couldn't hear the outside world's sounds at all. Others had to shout loudly near his ear for him to understand a little. There were also cases of soldiers with schizophrenia and epilepsy. A certain division received 722 new recruits in 1988, of whom 200 were shorter than 1.60 meters.

There are also some strange phenomena. A new soldier in a certain unit was just 18 years old but had a 3-year-old son. Two months after enlisting, he sobbed to the leader, saying that his girlfriend had written to him, proposing to break off their relationship. He wanted to bring his child to the unit to be raised by himself and requested the leader's approval. A certain company had 7 new soldiers who became fathers last year, all around 18 years old, and none of them had a marriage certificate. A new soldier wrote to the company commander, saying that he "only came to serve in the army, not to fight," because he was an only child and was "afraid of breaking the line."

The reasons for the poor quality of soldiers in some places are: first, the government leaders and comrades in the military service agencies in those places have a weak sense of national defense and do not understand that soldiers are an important part of the army's combat effectiveness, thinking that the quality of soldiers is not important during peacetime; second, the rewards and punishments for recruitment work are not strict, and the responsible persons of units that send unqualified soldiers have not received the appropriate punishment; third, the unhealthy trend is at work. It was found that most of the unqualified soldiers sent to the army by a certain city were pushed in through connections. As soon as the recruitment task for this year was issued, some people were already thinking of ways to push their children with bad records into the army.

The army has the task of transforming local youth into soldiers and helping them grow healthily. However, the foundation of a soldier, especially in terms of physical fitness, education, and political quality, is formed before enlistment. After enlisting, they only undergo a short period of training before entering specific combat positions and undertaking specific combat tasks, handling weapons, operating artillery, and being ready to engage in life-and-death struggles with invading enemies on the battlefield to complete the missions given by the country and the people. Therefore, even if one unqualified young person is placed into this armed collective, it is an irresponsible act towards the country and the people. The recruitment work for this year is about to begin, and military leaders appeal to all relevant departments in society to prioritize the interests of the country and the people and send new soldiers who excel in morality, intelligence, and physical fitness to the army.

    卫国需要好儿郎
    本报记者　罗同松
    这些年来，全国各地将优秀青年送往部队，从总体上说，中国人民解放军的兵员质量在逐年提高。但是也有少数地方打马虎眼，征集不合格的青年当兵，给部队造成很多困难。
    “文化程度”里有“水份”。某步兵团１９８８年接收的新兵中，有４３３人在入伍登记表“文化程度”栏中填写“高中毕业”。部队请驻地一所高级中学协助，对这部分新兵进行考试，结果，及格的只有４％，有３７％的人得了“０”分。地对空导弹部队兵器复杂，技术性强。上级给一个营分配了８０名“高中毕业生”。营的领导以初中３年级课程内容出题考试，结果只有７人勉强及格。他们只好花费时间，给这部分新兵补文化课。某炮兵连有名新战士入伍登记表上填写的是“高中毕业”，领导把他分配到指挥排。结果，他连“１５＋８＝？”也算不出来。没有文化的军队是愚蠢的军队。在军事科学技术飞速发展的今天，无论空军、海军、导弹部队、通信部队或是步兵，都需要具有很高文化程度的战士，才能掌握好兵器，圆满完成任务。记者问一个文盲战士：“你明明不识字，为什么要在表格里填‘高中毕业’呢？”这位战士若无其事地说：“我们县都这样，表格由自己随便填，填什么算什么。我不会写字，那表格是我爸请我表哥填的。”
    政治素质依然值得重视。某部队去年接收１５０名新兵，经查，竟有相当一部分人入伍前有斗殴、赌博、偷盗、流氓行为，其中有１４人曾被公安机关拘留过。一个杀人在逃犯、一个刑期未满犯、一个流氓团伙主犯，竟然混进部队穿上了军装。某团有恶习的４６名新战士中，有一半是共青团员。经查，许多共青团员是在他们应征入伍时被突击发展的。某步兵营去年接收的新兵中，有２８名共青团员，其中２５名的入团时间，是１９８７年９月至１０月的征兵期间。有名共青团员写入团申请书、填入团志愿书、支部讨论意见、上级团委批准，都是在一天之内进行的。
    聋人、病人也当了兵。某部１名新战士夜间走路常摔跤。医生检查发现，这个战士左眼视力为０．６，右眼视力才０．２；某连新兵去射击场看炮兵射击，打头两发炮弹时，绝大部分新兵怕响声震耳，捂上耳朵。有一名新兵却若无其事，原来他根本听不清外界的声音。别人和他谈话，只有凑近他耳朵大声喊叫，他才听知一二。神经分裂症、癫痫病人当兵者也不乏其例。某师１９８８年接收的７２２名新兵，有２００名身高不足１．６０米。
    还有一些怪现象，某部一名新兵刚满１８岁，却有一个３周岁的儿子。入伍两个月后，他哭哭啼啼向领导报告说，他的女朋友来信了，提出要与他脱离关系，他想把孩子接来部队，由自己抚养，请求领导批准。某营有７个去年入伍的、年龄均在１８岁左右的战士，入伍不久就当了爸爸，而他们都是没领有结婚证的。有名新战士给营首长写信，说他“只来当兵，不去打仗”，因为他是独生子，“怕断了苗”。
    一些地方兵员质量差的原因，一是那里的政府领导人和兵役机关的同志国防观念淡薄，不懂得兵员是军队战斗力的重要组成部分的道理，认为和平时期兵员质量差些无关紧要；二是征兵工作奖惩不严，输送不合格兵员的单位负责人，没有受到应有的处罚；三是不正之风作怪。据查，某市送往部队的不合格兵员，绝大部分是凭关系硬塞进来的。今年征兵任务刚一下达，就有一些人在想办法把自己有劣迹的子弟塞给军队。
    军队有完成地方青年向士兵转变，并且使其健康成长的任务。但是，士兵的基础，特别是身体、文化、政治因素是在入伍前形成的。他们入伍后，只经过较短时间训练，便要进入具体战斗岗位，承担具体战斗任务，弄枪、操炮，随时准备在血与火的战场上与入侵之敌进行殊死搏斗，完成祖国和人民交给的战斗任务。因此，哪怕是往这个武装集团里安插一个不合格青年，也是对祖国和人民不负责的表现。今年征兵工作即将开始，军队将领呼吁社会各有关部门以国家和人民的利益为重，向部队输送德、智、体皆优的新战士。
