North Korea-DPRK Diplomatic Relations Downgraded to Chargé d'Affaires Level
Hungary Establishes Ambassadorial Diplomatic Relations with South Korea

Pyeongyang, February 2 (Xinhua) — According to a report by the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's Ministry of Foreign Affairs today sent a note to the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding Hungary's formal establishment of diplomatic relations with South Korea. The note stated that the DPRK has decided to downgrade its diplomatic relations with Hungary from the ambassadorial level to the chargé d'affaires level. The note requests that the Hungarian government recall its ambassador to the DPRK, and the DPRK will also recall its ambassador to Hungary.

The note stated that the Hungarian People's Republic, despite repeated advice from the DPRK, has established diplomatic relations with South Korea. The DPRK naturally has to take measures in response to Hungary's actions. The note said that the DPRK will continue to make efforts to develop friendship with the Hungarian people.

According to the report, Hungary and South Korea reached a formal agreement on January 30 to elevate their relations to the ambassadorial level. The agreement came into effect on February 1.

　　朝匈外交关系降为代办级
    匈牙利同南朝鲜建立大使级外交关系
    本报平壤２月２日电  记者徐宝康报道：据朝中社报道，朝鲜外交部今天就匈牙利正式同南朝鲜建立外交关系，照会匈牙利外交部，决定把两国外交关系从大使级降为代办级。照会要求匈牙利政府召回驻朝大使，朝鲜也将召回驻匈大使。
    照会说，匈牙利人民共和国不顾朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的多次劝告，与南朝鲜建立了外交关系。对匈牙利的这一行动，朝鲜理所当然地要采取措施。照会说，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国今后仍将为发展与匈牙利人民的友谊继续作出努力。
    据报道，匈牙利与南朝鲜已于１月３０日达成正式协议，决定将双方关系升为大使级。协议自２月１日起生效。
