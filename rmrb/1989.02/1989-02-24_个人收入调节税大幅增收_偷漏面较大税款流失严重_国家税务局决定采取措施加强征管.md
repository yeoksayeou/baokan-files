    China began levying the personal income adjustment tax in 1987, using the tax lever to regulate social distribution. In 1988, the tax collected amounted to 114.64 million yuan, an increase of 2.66 times over the previous year. In January of this year, 14.46 million yuan has already been collected, an increase of 1.2 times over the same period last year. Despite this, the current situation of tax evasion for personal income adjustment tax is still quite serious, and tax revenue loss is severe.

    Jin Xin, Director of the State Taxation Administration, recently told reporters that some high-income individuals are "making money without paying taxes." Some do not voluntarily declare their income, some deliberately evade taxes, and a few individuals, even after being discovered, still refuse to pay despite repeated reminders. This situation is particularly prominent among some enterprise contractors, private business owners, and famous actors and artists.

    Jin Xin believes that the main reasons for tax revenue loss are that the personal income adjustment tax has a dispersed and hidden tax base, citizens lack the habit of voluntarily paying taxes, and some people have a weak sense of legal and disciplinary awareness. On the other hand, the tax authorities' collection and management capabilities are insufficient, the system is not perfect, and the methods are not comprehensive, which is also a reason. To address this situation, the State Taxation Administration will take the following measures to strengthen collection and management:

    1. Strengthen tax source control and fully implement the withholding tax system. All units that pay personal taxable income should strictly fulfill their obligations and proactively withhold and remit the tax due.

    2. Conduct pilot projects for taxable income declarations, gradually improve the personal tax declaration system, improve collection and management methods, strengthen publicity, and enable taxpayers to voluntarily pay taxes according to tax laws and regulations.

    3. Based on the tax sources in various regions, the State Taxation Administration will issue personal income adjustment tax collection targets. Local tax authorities will report the income progress on a monthly basis, and the State Taxation Administration will publish the quarterly progress in newspapers. For those who intentionally evade taxes or resist taxation, they will be required to make up the tax and be penalized according to regulations.

　　个人收入调节税大幅增收  偷漏面较大税款流失严重     
    国家税务局决定采取措施加强征管
    本报北京２月２３日讯  记者王锦鹄报道：我国从１９８７年开征个人收入调节税，运用税收杠杆调节社会分配。１９８８年征收税款达１１４６４万元，比上年增长２．６６倍。今年１月份已征收１４４６万元，比去年同期增长１．２倍。尽管如此，目前偷漏个人收入调节税的面仍较大，税款流失严重。
    国家税务局局长金鑫日前对记者说，现在有些高收入者“发财不纳税”，有的不主动申报收入，有的故意逃税，个别人被查出后依旧屡催不交。这种情况在一些企业承包人、私营业主和名演员、名画家中尤为突出。
    金鑫认为，造成税款流失的主要原因是个人收入调节税税源分散、隐蔽，公民缺乏自觉纳税习惯，有些人法纪观念淡薄；另一方面，税务部门征管力量不足，制度不健全，手段不完善，也是一个原因。针对这种状况，国家税务局将采取措施加强征管：一是做好税源控制，全面推行代扣代缴制度。规定所有支付个人应税收入的单位都要严格履行义务，主动代扣代缴应纳税款；二是搞好应税收入申报试点，逐步完善个人申报纳税制度，改进征管办法，加强宣传工作，使纳税人能自觉按税法规定自行纳税；三是根据各地税源下达个人收入调节税征收指标，各地税务机关按月上报收入进度，国家税务局将按季在报纸上公布。对有意偷税、抗税的违纪者，要补缴税款，并按规定处罚。
