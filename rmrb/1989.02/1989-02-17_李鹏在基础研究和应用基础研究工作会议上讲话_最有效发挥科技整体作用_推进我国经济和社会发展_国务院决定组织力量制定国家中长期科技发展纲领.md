Li Peng Speaks at the National Conference on Basic and Applied Basic Research
Best Utilize the Comprehensive Role of Science and Technology
Advance China's Economic and Social Development
The State Council Decides to Organize the Formulation of the National Medium and Long-Term Science and Technology Development Plan

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 16 — On February 15, Premier Li Peng delivered a speech at the National Conference on Basic and Applied Basic Research. The full text is as follows:

Comrades,

The National Conference on Basic and Applied Basic Research has successfully concluded today. On behalf of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, I congratulate the success of the conference and extend warm congratulations to the scientists who won the third National Natural Science Award!

Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, under the guidance of the Party Central Committee and the State Council's policy of "Economic construction must rely on science and technology, and science and technology work must serve economic construction," the face of China's science and technology work has undergone significant changes. The reform of the science and technology system has begun to show results. Science and technology work is gradually shifting towards adapting to the development of a planned socialist commodity economy. The immense role of science and technology in economic and social development is gradually being recognized by more people, and a social trend of respecting knowledge and talent is gradually forming. Reform and opening up have promoted the development of science and technology. The successful electron-positron collision of the electron-positron collider, the launch of the meteorological satellite, the underwater launch of a carrier rocket by a submarine, and the new achievements in the transformation of low-yield fields in the Huang-Huai-Hai region, all indicate that China's science and technology have entered the ranks of the world's advanced in many fields.

Comprehensively arranging science and technology work is not only a guarantee for China's science and technology itself but also an important condition for ensuring the healthy development of the national economy. Generally speaking, China's science and technology work can be divided into three levels. First, research and development work that directly serves the strategic goal of doubling the national GDP by the end of this century. Second, high-tech research and tracking to promote the formation and development of high-tech industries. Third, basic research work. These three levels of work are mutually promoting, organically linked, and indispensable. Although we need to invest most of our scientific and technological strength in the main battlefield of serving economic construction, and broad masses of scientific and technological personnel should show their talents on this main battlefield, basic research work, which is indirect or takes a longer period to take effect, must also be properly arranged. Major research topics can be proposed from economic construction and can also be proposed from the development of disciplines. Some exploratory topics, although they may not show application value at present or in the near future, do not directly meet the needs of current production and construction, but they deepen human understanding of natural laws, have long-term guiding significance for production and social development, and we should actively support them. We must prevent a narrow understanding of facing the economy. The State Council has decided to organize the formulation of the National Medium and Long-Term Science and Technology Development Plan, striving to organically combine technological development work, applied research, and basic research, to coordinate and develop comprehensively, and to best utilize the comprehensive role of science and technology to advance China's economic and social development and to contribute to the prosperity of world science and technology.

The progress of basic research, the rise of high-tech industries, and the widespread application of natural science achievements in various fields of economic construction and social development are important aspects of a country's comprehensive national power and are increasingly becoming important factors in today's global competition. If China cannot absorb the latest scientific ideas and achievements from the world and lacks the necessary capabilities in important scientific and technological fields, it will not be able to achieve modernization and will not be able to stand among the world's nations. Therefore, while ensuring that science and technology serves the main battlefield of economic construction, we must continue to strengthen basic research work, so that it can develop sustainably and steadily, reserve technology and talent for the next century, and meet the challenges of the 21st century's world economy and technology.

In the past 40 years, China's basic research and applied basic research work have made significant progress, already possessing a number of strong research institutions, forming a relatively complete discipline system, and establishing an excellent research team. Our scientists, experts, and technicians are brave in exploration, innovative, hardworking, and dedicated to the socialist scientific cause, working tirelessly on the front line of research for decades, and have achieved many results at the international advanced level. They have won the respect and support of the whole society. In recent years, the state has gradually increased and will continue to increase the allocation of funds for the National Natural Science Foundation. We have built a number of large-scale scientific projects and facilities and established a number of key laboratories. China's scientific research work has entered a new period of development.

We must recognize that we are a developing country and are currently in a period of rectification and adjustment, with many difficulties for the country, making it difficult to significantly increase investment in scientific research in the short term. However, with the development of China's economy, we will further increase investment in scientific research. We also hope that relevant departments and localities, especially large and medium-sized enterprise groups, will, while emphasizing development work, provide necessary support for basic research.

Comrades, the Chinese nation has had a glorious chapter in the history of world science. Today, the Chinese nation should strive to catch up with the progress of world science and technology and strive to make due contributions. The policy of reform and opening up and a good international environment have provided favorable conditions for the development of our science and technology. The Party Central Committee and the State Council sincerely hope that China's scientists and science and technology workers will strive to contribute to the development of China's science and technology and the revitalization of the Chinese nation!

　　李鹏在基础研究和应用基础研究工作会议上讲话    
    最有效发挥科技整体作用    
    推进我国经济和社会发展
    国务院决定组织力量制定国家中长期科技发展纲领
    新华社北京２月１６日电　李鹏总理２月１５日在全国基础研究和应用基础研究工作会议上的讲话，全文如下：同志们：
    全国基础研究和应用基础研究工作会议今天胜利闭幕。我代表党中央和国务院祝贺会议成功，并向获得第三次国家自然科学奖的科学家们表示热烈的祝贺！
    党的十一届三中全会以来，在党中央、国务院关于“经济建设必须依靠科学技术，科学技术工作必须面向经济建设”的方针指导下，我国科技工作的面貌发生了很大的变化。科技体制改革已经初见成效。科技工作正在逐步转向适应有计划的社会主义商品经济发展的轨道。科学技术对经济和社会发展的巨大作用，已逐步被更多的人所认识，尊重知识、尊重人才的社会风尚，正逐步形成。改革、开放促进了科学技术事业的发展。正负电子对撞机电子对撞成功、气象卫星上天、潜艇水下发射运载火箭、黄淮海低产田的改造研究取得的新成就等，都标志着我国科学技术在不少领域内已经跨入世界先进的行列。
    全面安排好科学技术工作不但是保证我国科学技术本身，也是保证国民经济健康发展的重要条件。一般地讲我国科技工作可以分为三个层次。首先是直接为本世纪末国民生产总值翻两番这个战略目标服务的研究和开发工作。第二是高技术的研究与跟踪，推动高技术产业的形成和发展。第三是基础性研究工作。这三个层次的工作是相互促进的、有机联系的整体，缺一不可。我们虽然要把大部分科技力量投入到直接为经济建设服务的主战场，广大科技人员应在这个主战场上大显身手。但是，间接的或较长时期才能发生作用的基础研究工作，也必须作出必要的安排。重大的研究课题可以从经济建设中提出，也可以从学科发展中提出。有一些探索性课题，虽然一时或目前还看不出应用价值，并不直接满足当前生产建设的需要，但它使人类对于自然规律的认识大大加深一步，对于生产和社会发展具有长远的指导意义，我们应该积极地给予支持。要防止对面向经济作狭隘的理解。国务院已决定组织力量，制定国家中长期科技发展纲领，力求把技术开发工作、应用研究、基础研究有机地结合起来，统筹兼顾，协调发展，最有效地发挥科学技术的整体作用，推进我国经济、社会的发展，进而为世界科学技术的繁荣做出我们的一份贡献。
    基础性研究的进展，高技术产业的兴起，自然科学成果广泛应用于经济建设和社会发展的各个领域，这是构成一个国家综合国力的重要方面并日益成为当今世界竞争中的重要的因素。如果我们中国不能吸收世界最新科学思想和科学成就，在重要的科技领域缺乏应有的能力，就不可能实现现代化，更不可能屹立于世界民族之林。因此，我们必须在保证科学技术为经济建设主战场直接服务的同时，继续加强基础性研究工作，使之得到持续稳定的发展，为下个世纪储备技术和人才，迎接２１世纪世界经济和技术的挑战。
    近４０年来，我国的基础研究和应用基础研究工作有了很大的发展，已经拥有了一批较强的科研机构，形成了门类比较齐全的学科体系，建立了一支优秀的研究队伍。我们的科学家、专家、技术人员，勇于开拓、勇于创新，任劳任怨，埋头苦干，数十年如一日地坚持在研究工作的第一线，献身于社会主义科学事业，取得了不少具有国际先进水平的成果。赢得了全社会的尊敬和支持。最近几年，国家已经逐步增加了，并将继续增加对国家自然科学基金的拨款。我们已建成了一批大型的科学工程和装置，建设了一批重点实验室。我国的科学研究工作进入了一个新的发展时期。
    应该看到，我们是一个发展中国家，当前又处在治理整顿时期，国家还有不少困难，一时难以大幅度增加对科学研究的投入。但是，随着我国经济的发展，我们将进一步增加对科学研究的投入。我们也希望有关部门和地方，尤其是大中型企业集团，要在重视开发工作的同时对基础性研究给予必要的支持。
    同志们，我们中华民族在世界科学史上曾经有过光辉的篇章。今天，我们中华民族应该努力赶上世界科技的进步，并争取做出应有的贡献。改革、开放的政策和良好的国际环境为我们发展科技事业提供了有利的条件。党中央和国务院殷切希望中国的科学家、科技工作者，努力奋斗。为发展中国的科技和振兴中华的事业作出自己应有的贡献！
