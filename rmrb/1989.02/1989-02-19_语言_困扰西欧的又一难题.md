Language – Another Challenge for Western Europe

Many people in Western Europe are recently discussing the "Single Market" of 1992 with great enthusiasm. They hope that after several countries voluntarily remove various barriers, they will bring more benefits to themselves. They never think that apart from the political and economic issues that have been debated for many years, there is now someone raising the language issue.

Some people are worried that when the majority of the 320 million people of different nationalities still need to use bilingual dictionaries to greet each other, how can a "Single Market" be established where people can live freely? If personnel are to truly move in large numbers, will the European Community not be flooded with sign language or translators? The current situation is that the number of European Community residents who use their freedom of movement to seek employment in other countries is still not high. The reason is that language is one of the obstacles. According to statistics, among the countries of the European Community, only Luxembourg, Belgium, and Ireland have more than 3% of their total population as immigrants. Among the immigrants in Ireland, the majority hold British passports, and these people do not have language problems. However, among the foreign residents in Luxembourg and Belgium, some are so-called "European bureaucrats" who can speak two languages, while the rest are mostly poor immigrants from Italy, Spain, Portugal, and Greece. These people, who have moved to other countries for a living, mainly rely on physical labor for a living and do not care about whether the language is unfamiliar. However, the European Community has 600,000 doctors, and although their qualifications are mutually recognized by each country, due to language barriers, only about 2,000 people move each year.

The current situation of the European Community's administrative organs also shows that the language problem cannot be overlooked in the formation of the "Single Market." Currently, the European Community's administrative organs use 9 official languages, and one-third of the administrative expenses are spent on translation each year; among the officials, one out of every three is responsible for translation.

Regarding the language problem, two solutions have been considered: one is to use translation machines, and the other is to promote a common language within the community.

It is said that the European Community is developing two types of translation machines: one is a translation machine for two main languages within the European Community (such as English and French); the other is a translation machine for all languages within the European Community. However, the results are not satisfactory.

As for the determination of a common language for the European Community, the matter is more complicated than the development of translation machines. In most European Community countries, the first foreign language taught in schools is English. Therefore, English should naturally be the common language of the European Community. However, the French are very dissatisfied with this. Because when the European Community was first established, people were shaping the ideals and ideologies of the European Community according to French culture. Currently, the official community has accepted the suggestion to encourage students to master two foreign languages, which means that within the European Community, French will be on an equal footing with English. In addition, the other two languages in Western Europe, Spanish and German, are also unwilling to be left behind.

The language problem is different from tax policies and technical standards, and it cannot be solved by simple addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, or by coordination and balance. The languages of Western Europe and the cultures they represent are the greatest wealth of the community, but they are also the greatest obstacles to achieving unity. How to preserve this wealth while overcoming this obstacle has become another major challenge for people in Western Europe.

　　语言——困扰西欧的又一难题
    钟旭辉
    不少西欧人近来谈起１９９２年的“统一大市场”，往往喜形于色。他们期望，十几个国家自愿取消各种关卡后，能给自己带来更多的实惠。他们压根儿也不会想到除那些多年来争吵不休的政治、经济问题还远没有解决外，现在又有人提出了语言问题。
    有人担心，在３．２亿不同国籍的人口中的绝大多数还必须借助双语辞典才能互致问候的时候，要建立一个人们可以在其中自由自在地生活的“统一大市场”，人员要真的大规模流动起来，欧共体还不得哑语泛滥，或者译官充斥？目前的事实是，欧共体各国居民利用其迁徙自由而易地谋生的人还不太多。究其原因，语言是障碍之一。据统计，欧共体各国中，移民人数超过总人口３％的国家只有卢森堡、比利时和爱尔兰三国。爱尔兰的移民中，持英国护照者占了大多数，这些人不存在语言问题。而居住在卢森堡和比利时的外国居民中，有些是能操两种语言的所谓“欧洲官僚”，其余则多是从意大利、西班牙、葡萄牙和希腊迁移来的贫民，他们为谋生计移居他乡后，主要靠卖力气吃饭，而不在乎语言是否陌生。可是，欧共体共有６０万名博士，尽管各国都相互承认其学历，但由于语言不通，每年流动的还不足２０００人。
    欧共体行政机构目前的实际情况也说明，要组成“统一大市场”，语言问题不可小视。目前，欧共体行政机构使用９种正式语言，每年１／３的行政开支耗费在翻译上；其官员中每三人即有一人专司翻译之职。
    对于语言问题，人们想到了两种解决办法：一是借助翻译机，二是在共同体内推行一种通用语言。
    据说，欧共体正在研制和开发两种翻译机：一种是欧共体内两种主要语言（如英语和法语）的对译机；另一种是欧共体内所有语言的互译机。但效果不尽如人意。
    至于欧共体通用语的确定，事情比研制翻译机更为复杂。在大多数欧共体国家中，学校开设的第一外语是英语。因此，英语理所当然地就应是欧共体的通用语了。可法国人对此就极不满意。因为欧共体刚建立时，人们原是按照法国的文化来塑造欧共体的理想和主义的。目前，欧共体官方已接受鼓励学生精通两种外语的建议，这就意味着在欧共体内，法语要跟英语“平起平坐”了。此外，西欧另外两种语言西班牙语和德语也是不肯甘居人后的。
    语言问题不同于税收政策和技术标准，不是一番加减乘除、协调平衡就能解决的。西欧的语言及其所代表的文化是共同体最大的财富，同时也是实现统一的最大障碍。如何保留这笔财富，同时又克服这个障碍，已成为困扰西欧人的又一大难题。
