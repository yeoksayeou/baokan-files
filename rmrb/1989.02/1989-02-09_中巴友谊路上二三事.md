A few years ago in the summer, we took the opportunity of attending the founding ceremony of the Gilgit branch of the China-Pakistan Friendship Association to travel along the Karakoram Highway. Although several years have passed, the moving stories of Sino-Pakistani friendship and the beautiful scenery there are as unforgettable as ever.

After the founding ceremony of the friendship association, we, along with the leaders of the China-Pakistan Friendship Association, went to the outskirts to pay our respects at the Chinese Martyrs' Cemetery. Here lie 88 Chinese road workers who sacrificed their lives while building the Karakoram Highway. The cemetery is adjacent to the highway, well-maintained and solemn, with a beautiful and tranquil environment, lush trees, and an old local resident who guards it year-round. Every day, many Pakistanis come here to pay their respects, mourn, and express their gratitude to the martyrs who laid down their young lives to build this road of Sino-Pakistani friendship.

Driving north from Gilgit along the Karakoram Highway for about three hours through towering mountains, we reached Pasu, a small village near the famous Batura Glacier, 127 kilometers from the Khunjerab Pass on the Sino-Pakistani border. The Chinese road construction command center was once located here, and now there are still some ruins of the camp. We walked around the site with reverence, imagining the bustling scenes of construction. Not far from the glacier is a village called Ghorimiti. As we entered the village, we met a few young women who, upon seeing we were Chinese, enthusiastically greeted us in Chinese: "Hello!" "You've worked hard!" "Sino-Pakistani friendship!" These sudden words surprised us. They voluntarily explained that they had learned these phrases from the Chinese road workers in the past. Almost all the local residents can still speak a few words of Chinese, although more than a decade has passed.

We stayed overnight at the Marco Polo Hotel in the village and were warmly received by the manager, Mr. Raja. During the road construction, Mr. Raja was the village head and provided a lot of help to the Chinese workers.

Mr. Raja enthusiastically led us on a tour of the village. In a small museum, local specialties and folk artifacts were displayed. Particularly striking were a pair of large, curved sheep horns hanging on the wall, over a meter long and quite rare. The owner introduced them as Marco Polo sheep, which can weigh over 250 kilograms and resemble a small cow. It is said that in the 13th century, Marco Polo discovered this species while traveling along the Silk Road to China, and later generations named it after him.

That evening, Mr. Raja specially prepared a meal for us to share. We wished him prosperity, and he smiled, saying, "I should thank my Chinese friends; the business is brought by the road." Since the completion of the Karakoram Highway, people's lives have improved, and tourists have been coming in droves. Several hotels and restaurants have been opened in the village, and some people have even bought cars to serve tourists. Mr. Raja predicted that after the Khunjerab Pass is opened to third countries, there will definitely be more tourists passing through, so he named the hotel after the well-known Marco Polo and believed that foreign tourists would also be interested in local customs, hence the small museum.

The news of our visit quickly spread throughout the village. The next morning, a farmer brought his daughter to the hotel to see us. He warmly said, "I heard you were here, so I brought my daughter to meet you. She has grown into a young lady now, and it was the Chinese who saved her life!" The girl, Sana, stood by her father, dressed in beautiful traditional clothing, but her right sleeve was empty. Seeing people looking at her, she shyly lowered her head and smiled.

The incident happened in the winter of 1978. A critically ill girl was admitted to the Chinese road construction hospital in Pasu. She was Sana, then only seven or eight years old. She had fallen while herding sheep on the mountain and injured her arm. After being treated by a local doctor for some time, her condition did not improve. Her arm began to turn black and lose sensation, her face was pale, and she had a high fever. After examining her, the doctor regretfully scolded the parents, "Why did you come so late? You've delayed the treatment, and now the only option is to amputate the arm." The parents burst into tears and pleaded, "Please, doctor, save my daughter's arm." Several doctors re-examined her and confirmed that the wound was severely infected, and the part below the injury was completely necrotic. If surgery was not performed immediately, it would endanger her life. They patiently explained to the parents the necessity of amputation. The parents had no choice but to agree painfully to the doctor's advice. The surgery was successful, and after a few days of care, Sana's condition gradually improved. When she was discharged, she was once again a lively and lovable child. The Sana standing before us now is tall and slender, with two large, intelligent eyes. She told us she is currently studying in school.

After bidding farewell to the villagers of Ghorimiti, we arrived in Hunza and stayed with Mr. Jamal Ali. Mr. Jamal Ali is a descendant of the former Hunza princely state and a friend of the Chinese people. He said, "This is a road of friendship, a bond connecting Sino-Pakistani friendship. It has brought prosperity to our Hunza region." Before the road was built, it took seven days on horseback from Hunza to Gilgit, but now it only takes two hours. With the improvement of transportation, local specialties can be exported, and necessary living materials and production resources can be imported. The pleasant climate and beautiful scenery attract a large number of tourists, developing this remote and closed mountain area and improving the lives of the people.

On a table in the living room, there was a half-body photograph of Premier Zhou Enlai, with his personal signature. The owner was proud of this. This was given to Mr. Jamal Ali's father, Mir Jamal Khan, the prince, in 1964 when he specially went to Rawalpindi to welcome Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to Pakistan. Noticing our interest in the photograph, Mr. Jamal Ali thoughtfully said, "The people of Hunza know that Premier Zhou Enlai, as the Prime Minister of China, made great efforts to help Pakistan maintain national independence and carry out economic construction. We will forever be grateful to him! Our family treasures the photograph of Premier Zhou as a family honor."

On our way back to Islamabad, our car ran out of gasoline. We tried several gas stations but found none with fuel, so we had to seek help from a nearby road maintenance unit. A captain from the unit, seeing that we were Chinese, warmly invited us into the office, offered us tea and snacks, and ordered a soldier to fill our car with the best gasoline. When we said goodbye and offered to pay for the gasoline, he waved his hand to decline, saying, "China is our friendly neighbor, and doing this small favor for a friend, how can we accept money!" Then he spoke a few words of Chinese, albeit not very fluently, "Don't—be—rude," which made everyone laugh.

　　中巴友谊路上二三事
　　纪兆璞　李枫
    几年前的夏天，我们利用去巴基斯坦北部参加吉尔吉特巴中友协分会成立的机会，沿喀喇昆仑公路作了一次旅行。时间虽过去了几度春秋，但感人的中巴友谊事迹同那里的美丽风光一样，令人难以忘怀。
    友协分会成立大会之后，我们和巴中友协的领导成员一起，到郊区中国烈士陵园敬献了花圈，这里长眠着88位为修筑喀喇昆仑公路而牺牲的中国筑路员工。陵园紧靠着公路，整修壮严肃穆，环境优美宁静，树木苍翠，有一位当地老人长年看守。每天都有不少巴基斯坦人到这儿来表示他们的致意，悼念并感谢烈士们用自己年轻的生命铺设了这条中巴友谊之路。
    从吉尔吉特驱车沿着喀喇昆仑公路北上，在崇山峻岭之中行驶约3个小时后，到达世界著名的巴土拉冰川下的帕苏。这是一个只有几户人家的小村，离中巴边境红其拉甫山口127公里。当年中国筑路指挥部曾设在这里，如今营地里仍有一些断墙残壁。我们怀着崇敬的心情在遗址上漫步，脑际浮现出工程施工的繁忙景象。距冰川不远，有一名叫古尔米特的村庄。当我们走进村口时，遇到几位青年妇女，她们见我们是中国人，热情地用中国话打招呼：“你好！”“辛苦了！”“中巴友好！”这突然出现的话语使我们相当惊奇。她们主动表明这是过去跟中国筑路人员学的。当地居民差不多都会讲几句中国话，虽然十几年过去了，至今仍保留在记忆中。
    我们在村里的马可·波罗旅馆住了一夜，受到经理拉贾先生的热情接待。在修建公路的日子里，拉贾先生是这个村的村长，给中国员工提供了许多帮助。
    拉贾先生兴致勃勃地带领我们在村里参观。在一个小博物馆里，陈列着当地的土特产和民俗用品。特别令人注目的是墙壁上挂着一对弯曲的大羊角，足有一米多长，很罕见。主人介绍说，这是马可·波罗羊，大的有250多公斤重，酷似一头小牛。据说13世纪时，马可·波罗沿着丝绸之路去中国，途经此地第一次发现了这种羊，后人就称它为马可·波罗羊。
    晚上，拉贾先生特备饭菜，同我们共进晚餐。我们祝他生意兴隆，他笑着说：这还得感谢中国朋友，生意是公路带来的。自从喀喇昆仑公路建成后，群众的生活路子宽了，来旅游的人络绎不绝，村中开设了好几家旅馆和饮食店，有的人还置备了汽车，专为旅游者服务。拉贾先生预测，红其拉甫山口向第三国开放后，一定会有更多的旅游者经过这里，所以他把旅馆起名为外国人所知晓的马可·波罗，而且相信外国旅游者也会对当地民俗感兴趣，所以又因陋就简地办起了这个小小博物馆。拉贾先生是个有眼光的人，不出他所料，不久后红其拉甫山口开放了，他的事业无疑会有很大拓展。
    我们来访的消息很快在村里传开了。第二天清晨，一农民带着他的女儿，到旅馆来看我们，他亲热地说：“听说你们来了，我把女儿带来给你们看看，她现在已长成大姑娘了，是你们中国人救了她一条命啊！”姑娘叫萨娜，站在父亲身旁，穿着漂亮的民族服装，但右袖管却是空荡荡的，看到人们注视着她，不好意思的低头微笑。
    事情发生在1978年冬天，驻在帕苏的中国筑路医院接待了一位病情危急的小女孩。她就是萨娜，当时只有七八岁，因上山牧羊摔伤了胳臂，请土医治了一段时间，但不见好。手臂开始变黑，失去知觉，脸色苍白，发着高烧。医生检查后以惋惜的口吻责怪家长：“怎么才来看？把孩子的病耽误了，现在只有截去这条胳臂。”家长一听，眼泪滚了出来，哀求道：“求求医生想办法保住我女儿的胳臂吧。”几位医生又反复检查，证实伤口严重感染，伤处以下部分完全坏死，如果不及时施行手术将会危及生命，并耐心向家长说明要马上截肢的道理。家长无奈，只好痛苦地同意了医生的意见。手术做得很成功，经过几天的护理，萨娜气色逐渐恢复，出院时又成了一个活泼可爱的孩子。现在站在我们面前的萨娜，亭亭玉立，两只大眼睛闪烁着聪慧的光芒，她告诉我们现正在学校读书。
    告别了古尔米特村，我们来到了洪扎，在贾马尔·阿里先生家作客。贾马尔先生是前洪扎土邦王的后代，也是中国人民的朋友。他对我们说：“这是一条友好公路，是连接中巴友谊的纽带。它给我们洪扎地区带来了繁荣。”公路通车前，从洪扎到吉尔吉特骑马要走7天，如今只需要2个小时。随着交通条件的变化，当地的土特产可以外运，所需生活物资和生产资料也可源源输进，宜人的气候和美妙的风光，吸引来大批旅游者，使这个偏僻闭塞的山区得到开发，人民生活普遍得到改善。
    在会客厅的一张桌子上，陈放着周恩来总理的一张半身照片，并有周总理的亲笔签名。主人对此引以自豪。这是贾马尔·阿里先生的父亲米尔·贾马尔·汗亲王1964年2月专程到拉瓦尔品第迎接周总理访巴时得到的厚赠。贾马尔先生注意到我们对这张照片很感兴趣，若有所思地说：“我们洪扎地区人民都知道，周恩来先生作为中国总理，为帮助巴基斯坦维护民族独立和进行经济建设，作出了巨大努力。我们永远感谢他！我们全家把周总理的照片作为家族的荣誉而珍藏着。”
    在返回伊斯兰堡的途中，我们的汽车汽油告罄，跑了几个加油站均无油可加，只好求助于附近的公路养护部队。部队的一位少校见我们是中国人，便热情地请我们进办公室坐，用茶点招待，并吩咐战士给我们的汽车加足了最好的汽油。待我们告别付汽油费时，他摆手谢绝，说：“中国是我们的友好邻邦，为朋友做这点小事哪能收钱！”接着他又用不熟练的中国话说了一句：“不—要—客—气”，逗得大家都笑了。
