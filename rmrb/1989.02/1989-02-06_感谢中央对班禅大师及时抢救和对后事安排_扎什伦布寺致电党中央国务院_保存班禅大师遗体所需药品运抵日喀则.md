Tashilhunpo Monastery sends a telegram to the Party Central Committee and the State Council expressing gratitude for the timely rescue and arrangements for the late Panchen Lama. Medicines needed for preserving the late Panchen Lama's body arrive in Shigatse.

Xinhua News Agency, Shigatse, February 4th - (Xinhua News Agency reporters, Central People's Radio reporters) The Democratic Management Committee of Tashilhunpo Monastery sent a telegram to the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the State Council on February 3rd, expressing gratitude for the Party and the state's dispatch of medical experts to rescue the late Panchen Vice Chairman during his critical illness and for the arrangements made for his funeral.

The telegram stated that during the late Panchen Lama's critical illness, the Party Central Committee and the State Council dispatched central leaders and a medical expert team to Shigatse for a visit and rescue mission, bringing the warmth of the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the people of all ethnic groups nationwide, deeply touching the monks of our monastery. After the unfortunate passing of the 10th Panchen Lama, the Party Central Committee and the State Council promptly made three decisions regarding the preservation of his body, the reincarnation of the soul boy, and the allocation of funds to build a stupa and a memorial hall, which deeply resonated with the monks and laypeople of our monastery and the Tibetan people. This made us feel the wisdom and correctness of the Party's religious and ethnic policies. For this, the monks of our monastery express our highest gratitude and respect to the Party Central Committee and the State Council.

The telegram said: In this time of profound sorrow, we will turn our grief into strength, follow the teachings of the Buddha, handle the affairs of our master's funeral, and pray for the early reincarnation of the soul boy and the restoration of the world.

The telegram from the Democratic Management Committee of Tashilhunpo Monastery concluded by expressing that in the future, the monks of our monastery will definitely, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the State Council, remember the teachings of the Panchen Lama, inherit his will, love the country and religion, manage the monastery well, handle religious affairs, propagate Buddhism, and save all beings. We will continue to hold high the banner of patriotism, unity, and progress, safeguard national unity, strengthen ethnic unity, and strive for the prosperity and happiness of the Tibetan monks and laypeople.

Xinhua News Agency, Shigatse, February 4th - (Xinhua News Agency reporters, Central People's Radio reporters) More than 500 kilograms of precious medicines needed for preserving the late Panchen Lama's body were delivered to Shigatse by special vehicle last night. Today, in the morning, the medicines were handed over to the late Panchen Lama's spiritual teacher, the Jia Ya Living Buddha, and the head of the Dechen Puquang Management Bureau, Purbuchang Danzen, by Vice Chairman of the Autonomous Region Political Consultative Conference and Director of the United Front Work Department of the Communist Party of Tibet Autonomous Region, Zheng Ying, representing the Autonomous Region Party Committee and the People's Government. This is the second batch of medicines sent after the Autonomous Region Party Committee and the People's Government sent 5 kilograms of saffron to preserve the late Panchen Lama's body on January 31st. The medicines sent this time include Puguma powder, high-grade camphor, sandalwood powder, and "six kinds of good medicine powder," among other precious medicines.

Zheng Ying said while handing over the medicines that the Party Committee and the government are very concerned about the long-term preservation of the late Panchen Lama's body and will do their best to help solve any difficulties in the work.
