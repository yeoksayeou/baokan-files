For many years, the cement dust from the cement factory located in the western suburbs of our city has been flying everywhere. The nearby Jiuxi Gang Primary School has been severely affected. Whenever there is a northwest wind, the school grounds turn gray and white, and the classrooms are filled with dust. Students constantly cough, and teachers have to wash their hair and change clothes almost every day. This has seriously disrupted the school's normal teaching order and affected the health of teachers and students. The school has repeatedly reported this issue to relevant departments in the city, but the problem has not been fundamentally resolved.

　　水泥粉尘飞扬　有害师生健康
    多年来，地处我市西郊的市水泥厂粉尘四处飞扬，与这家水泥厂近邻的九圩港小学深受其害。每当刮西北风时，校园内一片灰白，教室内也到处是粉尘，学生们咳嗽声不断，教师几乎要天天洗头换衣，严重影响了学校的正常教学秩序和师生的身体健康。学校曾多次向市有关部门反映，但未能从根本上解决问题。
