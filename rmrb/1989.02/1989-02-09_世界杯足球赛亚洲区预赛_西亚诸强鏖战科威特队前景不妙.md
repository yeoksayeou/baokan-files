　　西亚诸强鏖战科威特队前景不妙
    ２月３日晚，阿拉伯联合酋长国队在阿联酋沙迦进行的１９９０年世界杯足球赛亚洲区预赛第三组第五场比赛中，以１∶０战胜科威特队。
    目前，第三组的形势对阿联酋队有利。阿联酋队３战２胜１负积４分，还剩下对巴基斯坦队的一次交锋。而科威特队已打完４场比赛，成绩为３胜１负积６分。
    巴基斯坦队３战３负，已失去出线可能。阿联酋队首战曾以５∶０大胜巴基斯坦队，如果不发生意外，阿联酋队将在与巴基斯坦队的第二次交锋中获胜，并以净胜球数多而出线。
    ２月３日，在１９９０年世界杯足球赛亚洲区第一组预选赛的两场比赛中，伊拉克队以４∶０战胜约旦队，卡塔尔队以３∶０击败阿曼队。
    这个组有４个队参加预选赛，目前各队都赛过５场。卡塔尔队３胜２平，积分最高。伊拉克队３胜１平１负积７分，以１分之差暂居第二位。约旦队（１胜１平３负）和阿曼队（２平３负）分别积３分和２分。
