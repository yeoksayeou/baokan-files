	Benazir Bhutto Prime Minister's Interview Before Her Visit to China: Strengthen Mutual Assistance and Cooperation, Develop Sino-Pakistani Friendship

	People's Daily, Islamabad, February 10 - Xinhua News Agency reporter Li Jiasheng and People's Daily reporter Ren YuJun report: Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said, "The upcoming visit to China is my first official visit as Prime Minister. The main purpose is to meet with Chinese leaders, exchange views on issues of mutual interest, and personally see the great progress China has made in recent years."

	This was said by Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in an interview with Chinese reporters in Islamabad before her visit to China. Benazir Bhutto said that frequent mutual visits between Pakistani and Chinese leaders have become a tradition and are an important factor in making the two countries models of friendly nations. The deep friendship between the two countries and their peoples has withstood the test of many years and will continue to strengthen year by year. As developing countries, Pakistan and China cooperate in many fields. To help Pakistan achieve self-reliance, China has provided generous aid, enabling Pakistan's basic industries to develop. My late father, Prime Minister Bhutto, was one of the founders of Pak-China friendship. The elected government of the People's Party will continue the policies of Prime Minister Bhutto and is willing to cooperate with China in all aspects. We hope that the traditional friendship between the two countries will be further consolidated and developed.

	When discussing the world and regional situation as well as Pakistan's foreign policy, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said that Pakistan welcomes the easing of world and regional tensions. These positive developments will further promote peace, security, and stability in Asia and the world. She said that since the summit of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation held at the end of last year, improving relations between Pakistan and India has had a good start. We hope the two countries will maintain this momentum to accelerate the process of normalizing relations. Pakistan will continue to pursue a policy of non-alignment and support for justice, developing relations with neighboring countries and countries around the world on the basis of mutual respect for sovereignty and friendly cooperation.

	Regarding the Afghan issue, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said that Pakistan has always believed that the Afghan issue can only be resolved through political means, and the prerequisite for a political solution is the withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan. After that, the Afghan people will be able to exercise their right to self-determination without external interference. The future government's system and composition are internal affairs of the Afghan people, and Pakistan fully supports the efforts of the Afghan people in this regard.

	When discussing Pakistan's domestic policies, Benazir Bhutto said that the government led by the People's Party will do its utmost to promote the process of national democratization and establish a self-reliant national economic system. The current priority is to develop the national economy, improve science and technology, culture, improve the status of women, and eliminate poverty.

	Finally, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto hopes to convey through the Chinese media her personal and the friendly Pakistani people's best wishes to the great Chinese people.

　　贝·布托总理访华前夕接受我记者采访    
    加强互助合作　发展巴中友谊
    本报伊斯兰堡２月１０日电  新华社记者李家声、本报记者任毓骏报道：巴基斯坦总理贝·布托说：“即将对中国的访问是我担任政府总理以来第一次正式出访，主要目的是会见中国领导人，就共同感兴趣的问题相互交换意见，同时亲眼看看中国近年来取得的巨大进步。”
    这是贝·布托总理在访华前夕接受中国驻伊斯兰堡记者采访时说的话。贝·布托说，巴基斯坦和中国领导人之间的频繁互访已成为惯例，也是使我们两国成为友好国家的典范的重要因素。存在于两国和人民之间的深厚友谊已经经受了多年的考验，这种友谊还将逐年加强。作为发展中国家，巴中两国在许多领域相互合作。为了帮助巴基斯坦达到自力更生的目的，中国向巴基斯坦提供了慷慨的援助，使巴基斯坦的基础工业有了发展。先父布托总理是巴中友谊的缔造者之一，人民党的民选政府将继续布托总理的政策，愿意与中国在各方面开展合作。我们希望两国之间的传统友谊得到进一步巩固和发展。
    在谈到世界和地区形势以及巴基斯坦的外交政策时，贝·布托总理表示，巴基斯坦欢迎世界和地区局势的缓和，这些积极的事态发展将进一步促进亚洲及世界的和平、安全和稳定。她说，自去年底召开的南亚区域合作联盟首脑会议以来，巴印改善关系已经有了一个良好的开端，我们希望两国保持这种势头，以便加速关系正常化的进程。巴基斯坦将继续奉行不结盟和支持正义事业的外交政策，在互相尊重主权和友好合作的基础上同邻国以及世界各国发展关系。
    关于阿富汗问题，贝·布托总理说，巴基斯坦一贯认为，阿富汗问题只有通过政治途径才能得到解决，而政治解决的前提是外国军队首先撤离阿富汗。此后，阿富汗人民将能够在没有外来干涉的情况下行使自己的民族自决权。未来政府的体制及其组成是阿富汗人民的内部事务，巴基斯坦完全支持阿富汗人民在这方面的努力。
    在谈到巴基斯坦国内政策时，贝·布托表示，她们领导的人民党政府将尽最大的努力推进国家民主化的进程，建立自力更生的民族经济体制。当前首要的任务是发展国民经济，提高科技、文化水平，改善妇女地位，消灭贫困。
    最后，贝·布托总理希望通过中国新闻媒介，向伟大的中国人民转达她本人和友好的巴基斯坦人民的良好祝愿。
