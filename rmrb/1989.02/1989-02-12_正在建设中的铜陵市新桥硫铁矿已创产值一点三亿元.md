The New Bridge Sulfur Iron Mine, currently under construction, has achieved a production value of 130 million yuan. The New Bridge Sulfur Iron Mine is a large-scale, high-sulfur deposit primarily producing sulfur with multiple associated rare metals. Its geological reserves rank second in the country. Due to the complex hydrogeological conditions, the mine was originally planned to be completed and put into operation by 1990. During this period, the state provides an annual maintenance fee of 1.7 million yuan. Instead of relying on the state, the mine has actively organized surplus personnel to engage in self-operated production. From 1983 to last year, the cumulative production value from self-operated production reached over 130 million yuan, and it also saved the state 14.5 million yuan in maintenance fees.

The New Bridge Mine's ability to contribute to the state early is also due to the support policies of the local government. The contract signed between the Tongling City Government and the mine stipulates: "Ensure the delivery, retain all surplus profits, and manage expenses autonomously." The New Bridge Mine has used these autonomous rights to address the living welfare and bonus issues of the miners relatively well, further motivating everyone's enthusiasm and enhancing cohesion.

    正在建设中的铜陵市新桥硫铁矿已创产值一点三亿元
  　新桥硫铁矿是一座以硫为主、伴生多种稀有金属的大型高硫矿床，地质储量居全国第二位。由于水文地质复杂，计划到一九九○年才建成投产。这期间，国家每年给维护费一百七十万元。这个矿不躺在国家身上，而是积极组织富余人员进行自营生产。自一九八三年到去年，除自营生产产值累计达一点三亿多元，还为国家节约维护费一千四百五十万元。
    新桥矿能为国家早作贡献，还得力于当地政府的扶持政策。铜陵市政府与这个矿签订的承包合同规定：“确保上交，超利全留，费用自主”。新桥矿运用这些自主权，比较好地解决了矿工生活福利和奖金问题，进一步调动了大家的积极性，增强了凝聚力。
