Pebble Art
Peng Shuntong

Pebbles—millions of years lying in rivers, enduring the wind and waves, quietly sleeping. Now, one by one, they are awakening, becoming treasured artworks in the hands of people. From stone to pebble art, this is truly a marvelous creation.

The designers at the Beijing Carpet Factory No. 5, including Kong Xianghua, Man Guoqing, Zhao Zhengming, and Han Shafei, are the creators of this transformation. They strive for innovation, painting exquisite pictures on each pebble:

Roaring tigers, majestic vultures; fierce-looking Zhong Kui, the poet Li Bai with his hundred poems, the free-spirited Eight Immortals, and Bodhidharma, the Zen master who meditated for ten years. The four seasons of spring, summer, autumn, and winter, lotus flowers emerging from water, autumn chrysanthemums in the mountains, and innocent village children...

Each pebble painting is ingeniously conceived and full of imagination. Painting on pebbles is not like painting on paper or cloth; instead, one must follow the shape and posture of the stone to compose the picture, and the brushwork must change with the stone's contours. The painting must blend with the stone while still revealing its natural color. Therefore, pebble art is not simply painting on stone but rather combining the characteristics of oil painting and traditional Chinese painting with the texture of the stone.

Stones come in countless shapes and forms, a testament to nature's artistry. No two stones are the same, and even if the same pattern is created by the same hand, there will still be variations, making pebble art uniquely charming.

The appeal of pebble art also lies in the fact that it does not rely on the material but rather on the clever composition to bring aesthetic enjoyment to people. Though small enough to fit in the palm of your hand, it can reveal an endless artistic world. It can serve as a paperweight, accompanying calligraphers and painters, or as wall decor in a room. It can also be cherished by collectors.

　　卵石画
    彭顺通
    鹅卵石——千百万年来躺在河川里，任凭风吹浪打，静静地沉睡着。
    如今它们一个又一个地醒来了，成为人们爱不释手的艺术品。从石头到卵石画，这真是一个绝妙的创作。
    北京市地毯五厂的设计人员孔祥华、满国强、赵争鸣、韩沙菲等，正是这点石成金的创制者。他们刻意求新，在一块块鹅卵石上绘出一幅幅令人叫绝的图画：
    呼啸生风的猛虎，威风凛凛的秃鹫；横眉立目的钟馗，斗酒诗百篇的李白，飘逸桀骜的八仙，尊号禅宗祖师面壁十年的达摩。
    春夏秋冬四季山水，出水芙蓉娇娇浴女，山野秋菊，乡村憨娃……
    这一幅幅卵石画构思巧妙，富有想象力。在鹅卵石上作画，不像在纸上或在布上，而是要依照石头的形状、态势构图，笔法要依石画的变化而变化。要使画稿和石头融为一体，同时，仍能展露石头的本色。所以卵石画不是在石头上单纯地作画，而是要融汇油画国画的特点又有石头的质感。
    石头千姿百态，这是大自然的鬼斧神工。它们没有一块是相同的，即使是一种图案，即使出自一人之手，也会有所变化，这就使得卵石画独具魅力。
    卵石画的引人之处还在于，它不以材料取胜，而是靠巧妙的构图给人们带来美的享受。它巴掌大小，却能展现无穷的艺术世界。它可以作镇纸，与书画家做伴，它可以作为壁挂装饰于室内，它还可以为收藏家们所珍爱。
