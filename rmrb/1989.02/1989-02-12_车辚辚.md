In Daqing, among the crowds of the seismic exploration teams who have been tirelessly traversing the wilderness for years, I am searching for you—

I seem to have seen you on the wall of the exhibition hall. At that time, you turned sideways and looked back, with a bundle of thick black fire lines on your shoulders, and frost flowers on your fur hat. You smiled at me with a radiant smile, and a scorching masculine aura emanated from your padded jacket. This momentary image, fixed in time, has been lingering in my heart, and I really want to hold your hand.

The first time I saw the seismic exploration team relocating, I was amazed by its grandeur: it was like a dragon spouting clouds and breathing fire, holding thunder and lightning, winding its way majestically. The giant wheels of the special-purpose vehicles made the earth tremble, as if moaning from the depths of the earth. The Daqing Petroleum Administration Bureau's Geophysical Exploration Company has 20 such seismic teams. The young drivers, like the mythical Xi He, drive the dragon chariot carrying the sun, traveling around. The caption under your photo reads: "Messenger of Light."

Daqing, which produces half of the country's annual oil output, is at its peak. As her children, you must constantly find new oil and gas structures to replenish yourselves. Thus, the exploration army, like a series of arrows, shoots out in all directions: the Sanzhao Plain, the banks of the Nenjiang River, the vast grasslands of Hulunbuir... The seismic team is a nomadic tribe, a child of nature, using highly modernized equipment to knock on the gates of the underworld. And you are just one of the three thousand oil seekers.

On the vast and flat grasslands of Hulunbuir, more than two thousand miles away from Daqing on the China-Mongolia border, you sit on the step of the air-conditioned tent car, silently smoking a cigarette made of tobacco leaves. The autumn grasslands are desolate yet colorful, with blue aster flowers blooming everywhere. Inside the small courtyard formed by various vehicles, the young people dance to the rhythm of disco. But you are already in your late fifties, with graying hair and a desolate gaze. You neither smile nor look at me, but stare silently at the distant horizon. You look at this photo, carefully wipe it with your sleeve, nod, and say, "It looks like me from back then, very much like me."

I do not know how to address you. You are not a model worker or an official, but a respected elder. For 30 years, you have been guarding the oil stove, and your youth has faded away with the rolling wheels amidst the clanging of steel. At that time, there was no disco, no air conditioning or satellite ground stations, and no high-efficiency equipment imported from the United States and France. You and your teammates slept in cow sheds and stables, ate steamed buns, and drank cornmeal gruel and wild vegetable soup. You dug mud pits on the hard frozen ground and waded through knee-deep snow to carry grain... You have suffered enough, like the chaotic and endless tire tracks left on the earth, countless to count. Now the conditions have improved, and you should retire. Moreover, your hands, afflicted with arthritis, can barely hold a knife. You hold that photo, your eyes pressed tightly against it, and your arm trembles violently. Your hands are still stained with the soybean milk you just ground for the team members. You say, "Actually, he is more like your son, a more handsome and intelligent young man, driving a car in another seismic team, playing the guitar beautifully. However, he was killed in an accident not long ago." Your tears flow like transparent tadpoles, softly calling his name; he was the same age as the young people in front of you.

Yet you still smile, in a new magazine's insert, alongside a modern woman in a bikini, a self-made businessman riding a motorcycle and prospering, and a small miracle worker who saved a factory. Your smile is reserved and steadfast, with faint down on your lips like young shoots in spring. You can see the white hot breath you exhale. Now, you drive the car he left behind, humming "Alibaba," and take your buddies back and forth on the survey lines. The grasslands are endless, hiding ferocious white bones, and wolves boldly size you up, as if sizing up a can of fragrant lunch meat. You wink at me, whistle a light tune, and step on the accelerator towards the wolf. The people on the car let out a roar, and two forms of life engage in a game. The wolf can no longer hold out and reluctantly collides with the metal. Its bones crack, turning into a decent dinner on the seismic team's table. You drink alcohol, under the soft light of the bedside lamp, reading a letter with elegant handwriting. In the morning, I find your pillow wet.

You were born in a thatched hut, and now that place has been leveled, and modern-style buildings have been erected. On the spacious streets of Saertu, many of your contemporaries are strolling with their lovers under the willow trees, adjusting their appetites in newly opened Western restaurants, and showing off on motorcycles in the surging traffic. But when you were 18, you shouldered the fire lines, guiding the sound of artificial earthquakes all the way. People often forget you, but in your dreams, neon lights always flicker. There is never a scent of men's cosmetics on you, only sunshine, soil, wild winds, rain, snow, and chlorophyll. When we meet, you shake my hand, and the first question you ask is, "What movie is playing at the cinema at home?"

You show me that letter. The writer is your newlywed wife, also a driver, but in another seismic team, 50 miles away from you. The letter says she misses you, misses you so much that she wants to sprout wings and fly to your side. The letter also says that recently she often feels nauseous and likes to eat sour things; does sour mean a boy and spicy mean a girl? She hopes you will give a good name to the future son. You lie on the warm earth, smelling the intoxicating scent of ripe wormwood. You flip through the dictionary over and over. Later, you write the most beautiful words on a kite, cut the string, and let it fly with the wind.

You tell me that yesterday, the odometer on your car showed 40,000 kilometers, meaning you have just returned after circling the earth. Your predecessor wrapped a red silk cloth around the gear shift, and you can still feel his residual body heat. He died with his body pressed against the ground, as if kissing the deep tire tracks on the earth. This was his only kiss; he had never even touched a girl's hand in his life. You shake your head and smile bitterly at the photo in my hand, frankly admitting that since you started this "geophysical" job, you have never had your photo taken, and he was the same.

So who are you? Where are you exactly? You do not answer, only smile. Your work uniform is printed with a towering drilling rig and a cluster of surging waves. You are forever young, forever happy, forever looking at the world with clear eyes. On the road back from the exploration team's triumphant return, I see group after group of young people sticking their heads out of the car windows, playfully sticking out two fingers to show off their victory. The caravan rumbles past. I think I will definitely find you among them.

　　车辚辚
    王立纯
    在大庆，在大庆长年累月奔波于荒原旷野的地震勘探队的人群中，我寻找着你——
    我在展览馆的墙上好像见过你。那时你侧身回首，肩上扛着一捆粗黑的火线，狗皮帽子凝着霜花，向我绽开一朵明媚的微笑，灼人的阳刚之气从扎杠棉袄里透射出来。这个瞬间被固定下来的形象一直在我心中萦绕，我很想握到你的手。
    头一次看见地震勘探队搬迁，我为它的恢宏大气而惊叹：那简直是一条喷云吐雾挟雷持电的巨龙，鳞爪上还带着远古洪荒的泥土和藻类，威壮地蜿蜒来去。专用异型车的巨轮使大地战栗不已，仿佛来自地层深处的呻唤。大庆石油管理局地球物理勘探公司拥有２０个这样的地震队，年轻的驭手们像神话中的羲和驾着龙骖之车载着太阳巡游。你照片下面的题字是：光明使者。
    年产石油占全国一半的大庆正处在极值线上。做为她的儿女，你必须不断找到新的油气构造补充自己。于是，勘探大军像一支支响箭射向四方：三肇平原，嫩江两岸，呼伦贝尔大草原……地震队是游动部族，大自然的骄子，它以高度现代化的精良装备叩响地宫之门。而你，只是三千找油人当中的一个。
    在坦荡如砥的呼伦贝尔大草原，距离大庆二千余里的中蒙边境上，你坐在空调宿营车的踏板上，默默抽着叶子烟。秋天的草原空寂而斑斓，到处盛开着淡蓝色的矢车菊。各式各样的车辆围成的小四合院里，青年们踏着迪斯科的旋律跳舞。而你已经年近花甲，头发灰白，目光凄清，不笑，也不看我，只是凝望着遥远的天际出神。你看着这张照片，用袖子小心拂拭了一下，点点头说，很像当年的我，很像。
    我不知该怎么称呼你。你不是劳模也不是干部什么的，只是一位受人尊敬的长者。３０年来，你一直守着燃油灶，青春年华随着车轮的辗转消逝在钢铁的铿锵声中。那时没有迪斯科，没有空调和卫星地面站，没有从美国法国引进的高效设备，你和你的队友们睡过牛棚马圈，吃窝窝头，喝苞米面糊糊野菜汤，在坚硬的冻土地上刨泥浆坑，趟着没膝深的大雪背过粮食……你吃的苦够多了，就像留在大地上凌乱而漫长的车辙，扳着指头也数不清。现在条件好了，你也该退休了，而且你患有关节炎的手常常连菜刀也拿不住。你捏住那张照片，眼睛紧贴在上面，手臂剧烈地颤抖起来，上面还沾着你用小手磨为队员们刚刚磨好的豆浆。你说，其实他更像你的儿子，那是个更帅气更聪明的小伙子，在另外一个地震队开汽车，弹得一手好吉他，然而，他在不久前的一次事故中牺牲了。你的泪水像一串串透明的小蝌蚪忽忽地游开来，一面轻轻呼唤他的名字；他和眼前这伙青年人一般大。
    而你仍然在微笑，在一本新出版的杂志插页上，和三点式摩登女郎，和骑着摩托跑买卖春风得意的“个体户”，和一个人救活一个厂的小神仙交相辉映。你的笑含蓄坚韧，嘴唇上淡淡的茸毛像春天里刚刚出土的禾苗，能看出你呼出的乳白色热气。现在，你开着他留下的那台车，嘴里哼着“阿里巴巴”，拉着你的小哥们往来于勘测线上。大草原蓑草无边，掩映着一处处狞厉的白骨，野狼大模大样地打量你，好像打量一听香喷喷的午餐肉。你向我眨眨眼睛，吹一阵轻飘飘的哨音，加大油门朝野狼冲过去。车上的人发出一片呐喊，两种生命形态展开一场游戏，野狼终于支持不住，与金属的物质极不情愿地抵碰了一下。它的筋骨坼裂了，变成一顿满不错的晚餐摆到地震队的桌子上。你喝了酒，在柔和的床头灯光下看一封字迹娟秀的信，早晨起来我发现你的枕头湿了。
    你是在干打垒里出生的，现在那地方被夷为平地，盖起一幢幢现代风格的大楼。在萨尔图宽敞的大马路上，你的许多同龄人正在柳荫下挽着情侣踱步，正在新开业的西餐馆里调理胃口，正在潮水般的车流里驾着摩托大出风头。而你１８岁的时候就扛起了火线，引导着人工地震的炮声一路响过来。人们常常遗忘你，而你的梦境里却总是闪烁霓虹灯的光彩。你的身上从没有过男士系列化妆品的气味儿，有的只是阳光、泥土、荒风、雨雪和叶绿素。见面的时候你握握我的手，问我的第一句话是，家里的电影院在演什么片子。
    你给我看了那封信。写信的人是你新婚的妻子，她和你一样，也是一名司机，不过她在另外一个地震队，和你相隔５０里。信上说，她想你，想你想得发疯，恨不能插上翅膀飞到你的身边。信上还说，最近她常感恶心，喜欢吃酸的；酸儿辣女是不是？她希望你给未来的儿子起个好名。你躺在温暄的土地上，闻着蒿草成熟醉人的气息。一遍又一遍翻着字典。后来你把最美好的字眼一古脑写在风筝上，扯断线儿，任它随风飘去。
    你对我说，昨天，你车上的里程表显示出了四万公里，也就是说，你绕行地球一圈之后刚刚归来。你的前任在档杆上包了一块红绸子，至今你还能感到他留下的体温。他死去时身子匍伏着，像在亲吻大地上深深的辙印。这也是他唯一的一次亲吻，生前他连女孩子的手都没碰过一下。你对着我手上的照片摇头苦笑了，坦率地承认，自从干上“物探”这行当就没照过像，他也一样。
    那么你是谁？你到底在哪里？你不回答，只是微笑。你的工服上印着一座巍峨的钻塔，一簇喷溅而起的浪花。你永远年轻，永远快乐，永远用清澈的眼睛看世界。在勘探队伍凯旋归来的路上，我看见一群又一群青年人从车窗里探出头来，向我调皮地伸出两个指头炫耀胜利。车队隆隆驶过。我想，我一定能在他们中间找到你。
