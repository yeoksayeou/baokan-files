Over 200 intellectuals, who have dedicated their hearts and minds to the prosperity of our country and the rejuvenation of our nation, were invited to the Central United Front Work Department today to celebrate the traditional Spring Festival.

Yang Mingfu, a member of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the head of the Central United Front Work Department, warmly welcomed the arrival of friends from various circles. He said, "To make our country and our nation stand tall among the world's nations, and to make the lives of our people more prosperous and happy, our intellectuals have a responsibility that cannot be shirked."

Representatives from the fields of education, science and technology, social sciences, medicine and health, and culture and arts expressed their hopes at the meeting that the Central United Front Work Department would pay more attention to the work, study, and life of intellectuals, and turn the department into a home for intellectuals.

Yang Mingfu, along with Vice-Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Yan Jizi, Fei Xiaotong, and Lei Jiequn, and Vice-Chairmen of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Yang Jingren, Zhou Peiyuan, and Qian Weichang, sat together with senior, middle-aged, and young intellectuals for a friendly chat.

Yang Mingfu said in his speech that intellectuals are an important force in the modernization drive of socialist construction in our country, and they are also an important force in supporting and implementing the line, principles, and policies of the Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee. Over the past ten years, the vast number of intellectuals in our country, together with the people of the whole nation, have striven hard to promote the great cause of reform and opening up, achieving victory after victory.

Yang Mingfu said that intellectual work is an important task in the united front work of the new period. One of the main functions of the Central United Front Work Department is to establish close ties with broad circles of intellectual friends, to timely reflect the opinions and voices of intellectuals, and to actively, proactively, and enthusiastically serve everyone. Our country's intellectuals have a great advantage: they have a strong sense of national pride and social responsibility. We are willing to do our best to actively serve everyone, so that the intellectual circle can better play its role in promoting the construction of socialist material and spiritual civilization; at the same time, we will also actively support the expansion of exchanges between the intellectual circle and overseas and Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan intellectuals, relying on everyone to do a good job and promote the completion of the great cause of national reunification.

Yang Mingfu hoped that in the new year, the intellectual circle would produce more outstanding talents who make outstanding contributions to the motherland, and make greater contributions to deepening reforms, developing the economy, maintaining stability and unity, and consolidating and developing the patriotic united front.

Professors Jin Kaicheng and Chen Bingzhen from Peking University, Professor Chen Zhiliang from Tsinghua University, Principal Wen Ze from Beijing No. 158 Middle School, artist Shi Yu, writer Liang Xiaosheng, Associate Professor Chen Zhangliang from Peking University, and Director Wang Liping of the Central Film Orchestra, spoke at the gathering.
