Since 1986, China's exports of mechanical and electrical products have grown rapidly for three consecutive years. According to customs statistics, the export value in 1985 was $1.68 billion, $2.48 billion in 1986, $3.854 billion in 1987, and reached $6.2 billion in 1988, which is 3.7 times that of 1985. The proportion of mechanical and electrical products in the total national export value has also increased from 6.1% in 1985 to 13%.

The volume of exports of mechanical and electrical products often reflects a country's industrial technology level and whether its foreign trade structure is reasonable. How can we maintain the good momentum of China's exports of mechanical and electrical products? On January 31, we visited Zhou Jiannan, who has extensive research on the macro-management of the mechanical and electrical industry, to discuss this issue.

Zhou Jiannan has long been engaged in the technical and management work of the machinery industry. He has served as the deputy minister of the First Ministry of Machinery Industry, deputy director of the State Import and Export Commission, and minister of the Ministry of Machinery Industry. Now, he is entrusted by the State Council to oversee the work of exporting mechanical and electrical products.

We walked through a quiet courtyard and arrived at the modest and elegant living room of Zhou Jiannan's home. He warmly received us. He introduced that last year, mechanical and electrical products not only had a rapid increase in export value, but also had significant changes in product structure, market distribution, and other aspects. The export of products with relatively high technology content grew faster, and the export to North America and Western Europe grew faster than to other markets. Companies such as Wanbao Electrical Appliances Industrial Company, Shenzhen Seagull Electronics Group, Tianjin Communication and Broadcasting Industrial Company, Dalian Shipyard, Second Automobile Manufacturing Plant, and Shenyang Third Machine Tool Plant have entered the international market, showing the export advantages of key enterprises and groups. The export of technical equipment to foreign countries, as well as processing with supplied materials, assembling with supplied parts, and processing with supplied drawings and samples, have also developed.

When talking about the reasons for the rapid growth of mechanical and electrical product exports, Zhou Jiannan summarized it in four sentences: correct decision-making, strong policies, solid measures, and organizational implementation. The State Council made a strategic decision to list mechanical and electrical products as key export commodities and to give them priority support. Relevant departments and local governments formulated a series of policies to encourage the export of mechanical and electrical products, which mobilized the enthusiasm of export production enterprises and foreign trade enterprises. The State Council established the Office for the Export of Mechanical and Electrical Products, and relevant departments and local governments also strengthened the organizational leadership of the export of mechanical and electrical products. Zhou Jiannan said that in recent years, due to the development of the new technological revolution in the world and the appreciation of some currencies, it has promoted the adjustment of the world economic structure, which has also provided opportunities for China's exports of mechanical and electrical products.

As an expert in economics, technology, and foreign trade, Zhou Jiannan has a clear understanding of the situation of China's exports of mechanical and electrical products. He believes that China's exports of mechanical and electrical products are still in the initial stage, and the current export value accounts for less than 1% of the total global exports of mechanical and electrical products; some products have poor quality, delayed delivery, and inadequate maintenance services; the policies formulated by the state to encourage the export of mechanical and electrical products have not been fully implemented, affecting the enthusiasm of export enterprises; the export system has not been streamlined, the agency system has been implemented slowly, and the integration of industry and commerce is not good; opening up the international market is also a weak link, which cannot meet the needs of expanding exports.

Expanding the export of mechanical and electrical products is necessary to promote the technological progress of the mechanical and electrical industry and even the entire industrial sector, as well as to optimize the export commodity structure, enhance foreign exchange earning capabilities, and further open up to the outside world. If the mechanical and electrical industry does not participate in international competition and face the challenges of the international market, it will not be able to compete for its rightful position in the world; if the export of mechanical and electrical products cannot develop significantly, it will affect the large-scale development of China's foreign trade. Zhou Jiannan has such an understanding of the strategic significance of expanding the export of mechanical and electrical products. He said that to persistently promote the export of mechanical and electrical products, we need to further improve our understanding of the importance of this work.

Adjusting the economic structure and reducing the scale of basic construction will reduce the domestic demand for mechanical and electrical equipment by several hundred billion yuan. Zhou Jiannan believes that this is a severe test and an opportunity for the mechanical and electrical industry. The mechanical and electrical industry should actively adjust its product structure and open up the international market. We must solidly do the basic work: strengthen the export production system and provide more high-quality and marketable products; implement policies to encourage the export of mechanical and electrical products, streamline the export system, improve the export contract system, and mobilize the enthusiasm of export enterprises.

Not long ago, Zhou Jiannan visited Western Europe to investigate the mechanical and electrical market situation and study the issue of opening up the international market. He particularly emphasized the importance of opening up the international market. Having good products is not enough; we also need sales channels and media. Only by gaining the trust of foreign users can we enter the international market. Our export enterprises must firmly establish the concept of the international market, take the needs of the international market as the starting point and the foothold of production and operation activities. We must adhere to the principle of "customer first, reputation first," act according to international customs, ensure reliable quality, suitable varieties, timely delivery, and thoughtful service. These are important non-price competition means. We must be good at using these means and cannot rely solely on low prices for sales, otherwise, it will backfire. Reputation cannot be bought with money. Once a contract is signed with a foreign party, it must be fulfilled. After-sales service is crucial for establishing a reputation. We must ensure that the equipment is delivered with personnel, and after a large batch of products is delivered, installation and technical personnel should follow closely to ensure the normal operation of the equipment.

Currently, there is a phenomenon in the international market where the same product in the same market is competitively priced by several companies, causing disorder in export orders, loss of opportunities, and even making some foreign businesses uncertain and losing confidence in marketing and agency Chinese products. How to change this situation? Zhou Jiannan proposed three measures: First, take the path of collectivization. The original foreign trade companies and the various local branches that have independent accounting and self-balancing can voluntarily form professional export groups to jointly establish a stable export main channel. Second, give full play to the advantages of various foreign trade and industrial trade companies and appropriately divide the business scope. Third, give full play to the coordinating role of the China Machinery and Electrical Products Import and Export Chamber of Commerce.

Industrial and commercial integration is a form of export that has developed rapidly in recent years. Zhou Jiannan said: We should encourage industrial and commercial integration and jointly open up the international market. Currently, there are three types of industrial and commercial relations: foreign trade enterprises investing in production enterprises to have some source bases; some industrial enterprise groups and large enterprises with foreign trade operation rights have their own foreign trade sales departments to operate their export products; through acquisition, agency, and joint venture methods, foreign trade enterprises and production enterprises form contractual relationships. Regardless of the form adopted, they should be equal and mutually beneficial, forming a long-term partnership based on mutual dependence.

In a one-and-a-half-hour conversation, the 70-year-old Zhou Jiannan remained enthusiastic throughout. Finally, he emphasized that we need a medium and long-term development plan to open up the international market in a planned and focused manner, forming a "one-stop" service for key products, key export enterprises, and key markets.

　　坚持不懈地扩大机电产品出口
　　——周建南同志谈开拓机电产品国际市场
　　弋辉　皮树义
    从１９８６年开始，我国机电产品出口连续３年以较快的速度增长。据海关统计，１９８５年出口额１６．８亿美元，１９８６年２４．８亿美元，１９８７年３８．５４亿美元，１９８８年达到６２亿美元，是１９８５年的３．７倍。机电产品出口额在全国出口总额中所占的比重，也从１９８５年的６．１％上升到１３％。
    机电产品出口的多少，往往反映了一个国家工业技术水平的高低和外贸结构是否合理。如何保持我国机电产品出口的好势头？１月３１日，我们就这个问题，访问了对机电行业宏观管理素有研究的周建南同志。
    周建南同志长期从事机械工业技术、管理工作，曾任一机部副部长、国家进出口委员会副主任、机械工业部部长。现在，他受国务院委托，抓机电产品出口工作。
    穿过幽静的小院，我们来到周建南同志家中朴素大方的会客室，他热情地接待了我们。他介绍说：去年，机电产品不仅出口额增长较快，而且产品结构、市场分布等方面也有较大变化。技术比较密集的产品出口增长较快，向北美、西欧市场的出口增长快于向其它市场的出口增长。万宝电器工业公司、深圳赛格电子集团、天津通信广播工业公司、大连造船厂、第二汽车制造厂、沈阳第三机床厂等一批大型出口生产企业的产品进入国际市场，显示出了骨干企业和集团的出口优势。以技术设备向国外投资，以及来料加工、来件装配、来图来样加工等贸易方式也有发展。
    说起机电产品出口增长较快的原因，周建南同志概括了四句话：决策正确，政策有力，措施扎实，组织落实。国务院做出了把机电产品列为重点出口商品、重点扶植的战略决策，有关部门和地方制定了一系列鼓励机电产品出口的政策，调动了出口生产企业和外贸企业的积极性。国务院成立了机电产品出口办公室，有关部门和地方也加强了机电产品出口的组织领导。周建南同志说，这几年，由于世界新技术革命的发展和一些外币升值，促使世界经济结构调整，也给我国的机电产品出口提供了机会。
    周建南作为经济技术和外贸专家，对我国机电产品出口形势有着清醒的认识。他认为，我国的机电产品出口仍然处于起步阶段，目前出口额在国际机电产品出口总额中还不到１％；一些产品质量差，交货不及时，维修服务不周到；国家制定的鼓励机电产品出口的政策，还没有完全落实，影响出口企业的积极性；出口体制尚未理顺，代理制推行得较慢，工贸结合得不好；开拓国际市场更是一个薄弱环节，不能适应扩大出口的需要。
    扩大机电产品出口是促进机电工业以至带动整个工业技术进步的需要，也是优化出口商品结构，增强创汇能力，进一步对外开放的需要。机电工业不参与国际竞争，迎接国际市场的挑战，就无法争得在世界上应有的地位；机电产品出口不能有较大的发展，就会影响我国外贸的大发展。周建南同志这样认识扩大机电产品出口的战略意义。他说，把扩大机电产品出口坚持不懈地抓下去，需要进一步提高对这项工作意义的认识。
    调整经济结构、压缩基本建设规模，国内对机电设备的需求会减少几百个亿。周建南同志认为，这对机电工业是一个严峻的考验，也是一个机会。机电工业应当积极调整产品结构，开拓国际市场。要扎扎实实做好基础工作：强化出口生产体系，多提供质量优良、适销对路的产品；落实鼓励机电产品出口的政策，理顺出口体制，完善出口承包制，以调动出口企业的积极性。
    不久前，周建南同志曾到西欧考察了机电市场情况，研究了如何开拓国际市场问题。他特别强调要重视开拓国际市场。有了好的产品，还要有一定的销售渠道和媒介，只有取得国外用户的信任，才能进入国际市场。我们的出口企业必须牢固地树立国际市场观念，以国际市场的需求为导向，把满足国际市场需求作为生产经营活动的出发点和落脚点。坚持用户第一、信誉第一，按国际惯例办事，做到质量可靠，品种对路，交货及时，服务周到。这些都是重要的非价格竞争手段。我们要善于利用这些手段，不能只靠低价推销，否则，会适得其反。信誉是用钱买不来的。对外签了合同就要履行。售后服务对树立信誉很重要。应当做到机到人到，大批产品运到后，安装、技术人员应紧紧跟上，以保证设备的正常运行。
    当前，我们在国际市场上存在着同一种产品在同一个市场上由几家公司削价竞销、打乱仗的现象，造成出口秩序混乱，肥水外流，甚至使一些外商无所适从，失去经销代理中国产品的信心。如何改变这种状况呢？周建南同志说了三条：一是走集团化道路，原来的外贸公司同已独立核算、自负盈亏的各地分支机构，可自愿组成专业出口集团，共同建立起稳定的外销主渠道。二是发挥各外贸、工贸公司的优势，适当划分经营范围。三是充分发挥机电产品进出口商会的协调作用。
    工贸结合是近几年发展较快的一种出口形式。周建南同志说：应当鼓励工贸结合，共同开拓国际市场。现在工贸关系有三种情况：外贸企业向生产企业投资，拥有一些货源基地；一些有外贸经营权的工业企业集团和大型企业，设有自己的外贸销售部门，经营本企业的出口产品；通过收购、代理、联营方式，外贸企业与生产企业形成契约关系。无论采用何种形式，都应平等互利，形成相互依赖的长期伙伴关系。
    一个半小时的谈话，７０岁的周建南同志一直兴致勃勃。最后，他强调说，要有一个中长期的发展规划，以便有计划、有重点的开拓国际市场，形成重点产品、重点出口企业、重点市场“一条龙”。
