The secret was exposed, and opposition followed. West Germany halts the implementation of the new conventional short-range missile development plan.

Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, February 8 (Reporter Dai Lvbin) The West German government spokesman, Ost, announced in Bonn today that Chancellor Kohl has decided to halt the proposed new conventional short-range missile development plan.

Ost said, considering the "positive disarmament signals issued by the Warsaw Pact since last December" and the "Vienna conventional arms control talks scheduled to begin in March," with the agreement of Defense Minister Scharping, Chancellor Kohl decided "not to continue" the technical and experimental plans for the conventional short-range missiles being developed by the MBB company.

Ost said that Kohl and Scharping agreed that if the "Vienna conventional arms control talks achieve a low-level conventional balance," the West German government would ultimately abandon the plan to develop conventional short-range missiles.

Ost said that as early as 1982, during the Schmidt administration, discussions were held on the issue of the Pershing IA missile successor system. By the end of 1988, the West German Defense Department planned to commission the West German MBB company to develop a high-precision missile with a range of no more than 500 kilometers, primarily for "destroying enemy runways in the initial stages of conflict." According to a statement by an MBB company spokesman on the 7th, so far, the development work is still in the discussion and demonstration stage, and MBB has not yet received an official commission from the Defense Department.

The West German government's plan to develop short-range missiles has been little known until recently. It was only revealed to the public by a television magazine called "Der Spiegel." After the news was exposed, it sparked opposition from the opposition Social Democratic Party and the Green Party, as well as some members of the ruling Free Democratic Party.

Observers here believe that Chancellor Kohl's decision today to halt the implementation of the development plan is a wise move. Otherwise, the West German government, which is already in a difficult position due to the possible involvement of West German companies in the Libyan "poison gas factory" incident, might become even more passive due to the issue of MBB company developing new short-range missiles.

### 秘密被曝光　反对接踵来  西德停止实施新式常规短导研制计划

　  西德停止实施新式常规短导研制计划
    新华社波恩２月８日电  （记者戴履斌）西德政府发言人奥斯特今天在波恩宣布，科尔总理决定停止实行拟议中的新式常规短导研制计划。
    奥斯特说，考虑到“去年１２月份以来华约发出了积极的裁军信号”，和“３月份即将开始的维也纳常规军备控制会议”，在取得国防部长朔尔茨的同意后，科尔总理决定“不再继续推行”由ＭＢＢ公司研制常规短导的“技术和试验计划”。
    奥斯特说，科尔和朔尔茨一致认为，如果“维也纳常规军备控制会议达成低水平上的常规均势”，西德政府将最终放弃研制常规短导的计划。
    奥斯特说，早在１９８２年施密特政府时就讨论过潘兴ＩＡ导弹后续系统问题。１９８８年底西德国防部打算委托西德ＭＢＢ公司研制一种高精度射程不超过５００公里、主要用于“冲突开始阶段摧毁敌方机场跑道”的常规导弹。据ＭＢＢ公司发言人７日宣称，到目前为止，研制工作还仅处于探讨论证阶段，ＭＢＢ尚未得到国防部的正式委托。
    西德政府这一研制短导的计划一直鲜为人知。最近才被一家名为《消息》的电视杂志披露于世。消息披露后，引起了反对党社民党和绿党以至执政党之一的自民党一些议员的反对。
    此间观察家认为，科尔总理今天做出的停止执行研制计划的决定不失为一个明智之举。否则，因西德公司可能参与利比亚“毒气工厂”事件而处境被动的西德政府，很可能再因ＭＢＢ公司研制新式短导问题而更加被动。
