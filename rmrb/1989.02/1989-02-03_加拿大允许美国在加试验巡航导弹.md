Canada Allows the United States to Test Cruise Missiles in Canada

Our correspondent Guo Wenfu reports from Ottawa: Canada's new Minister of National Defence, Bill McKnight, announced today that the Canadian government has agreed to allow the United States to test the advanced AGM-129 type cruise missile in Canada.

According to reports, this advanced cruise missile is an improved version of the AGM-86B type cruise missile that has been tested in Canada multiple times since March 1984. It has a range of 4,000 kilometers and travels at subsonic speeds. Tests conducted on U.S. soil have failed several times, with only 3 successful tests in 1987 and 1988. According to the requirements of the U.S. Congress, at least 3 more successful tests are needed before it can be put into production.

The newly formed Canadian federal government's new cabinet quickly responded positively to the U.S. request. The U.S. testing of cruise missiles on Canadian territory is conducted under the agreement signed in February 1983.

This decision by the Mulroney government immediately drew criticism from opposition parties and anti-war organization leaders. They criticized the government's decision, saying it does not help in advancing the arms reduction negotiations between the two superpowers and will drag Canada into the arms race.

　　加拿大允许美国在加试验巡航导弹
    本报渥太华２月１日电  记者郭文福报道：加拿大新任国防部长比尔·麦克奈特今天宣布，加拿大政府已经同意美国在加拿大试验先进的ＡＧＭ—１２９型巡航导弹。
    据报道，这种先进巡航导弹是１９８４年３月以来在加拿大试验多次的ＡＧＭ—８６Ｂ型巡航导弹的改进型，射程达４０００公里，速度为亚音速。在美国本土上的试验曾几度失败，１９８７年和１９８８年仅获３次成功。根据美国国会的要求，至少要再有３次试验成功方可投入生产。
    刚成立两天的加拿大联邦政府新内阁对美国方面的要求迅速作出肯定的回答。美国在加拿大领土上试验巡航导弹是根据１９８３年２月协定进行的。
    马尔罗尼新政府的这一决定立即招致反对党和反战组织负责人的抨击。他们批评政府的这一决定无助于推进两个超级大国裁减军备的谈判，会使加拿大也卷入军备竞赛。
