Central American Five Nations Summit Achieves Results
Agreement Reached on Nicaragua's Democratization and Anti-Government Armed Groups

XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, Sun Coast (El Salvador), February 14 – (Reporters Hu Tairan and Song Xinde) The heads of state of five Central American countries reached an agreement on February 14 in this city regarding the early democratization of Nicaragua and the disarmament and return of anti-government armed groups. This is an important outcome of the two-day, fourth summit of the five Central American countries, which concluded today.

According to the "Joint Statement" signed at the end of the meeting, the Nicaraguan government decided to hold early elections by February 25, 1990, to elect the President of the Republic, mayors, and members of Congress, and to allow all political parties to participate in the elections. The Nicaraguan government had originally planned to hold elections in November of the following year. To ensure the fairness of the elections, the Nicaraguan government allowed international observers to monitor the elections in Nicaragua. In addition, the Nicaraguan government also guaranteed freedom of the press and the release of all political prisoners.

The joint statement said that at the same time, the heads of state of the five Central American countries guaranteed to formulate a "comprehensive plan" within 90 days to allow the 13,000 anti-government armed forces currently stationed in Honduras to lay down their arms and return home or go to a third country.

Regarding the security agreements on the borders of Honduras-Nicaragua and Honduras-El Salvador reached by the foreign ministers of the five countries in New York recently, the statement said that the executive committee composed of the five foreign ministers would "immediately" hold technical meetings to establish appropriate and effective institutions to implement the specific measures.

The heads of state of the five countries called on any foreign government in the region and outside the region to stop providing military aid, except for humanitarian assistance, to irregular armed forces.

According to another report, the leader of the Nicaraguan anti-government armed forces held a press conference in El Salvador on February 14, expressing that they would not accept the agreement reached at the summit of the five countries.

February 14, the heads of state of the five Central American countries held their final meeting in El Salvador, reaching an agreement on jointly maintaining peace in the Central American region. (Photo courtesy of Xinhua News Agency, fax photo)
