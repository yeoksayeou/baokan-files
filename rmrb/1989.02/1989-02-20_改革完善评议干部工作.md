Democratic evaluation of leading cadres plays a positive role in improving and expanding intra-party democracy, objectively and accurately understanding and utilizing cadres, and enhancing the overall effectiveness of leading cadres and the quality of cadres.

How to further reform and improve the democratic evaluation work, so that this good form can achieve better results? Currently, in addition to further studying and improving the scientific nature of the content and quantitative and qualitative evaluation of democratic evaluation in theory, it is also necessary to seriously study and solve some problems that arise during the evaluation process.

Cadres and the masses have insufficient understanding of democratic evaluation, and their psychological endurance is still relatively fragile. Some leading cadres are afraid that their authority will be affected, and normal work will be affected, and they cannot withstand the evaluation by the masses; the masses are afraid that the evaluation will not be good, and it will be just a formality with no effect; it is better to do it less.

The depth and breadth of the evaluation are not enough. Some units' cadres and masses are not very familiar with the evaluators' situation, and some have weak political participation and consultation capabilities. Some organizational and personnel departments' investigation teams are like "joint investigation teams," and the investigators are mostly temporarily assigned, and they are not very familiar with the investigated cadres. The scope of the investigation is not wide, and the opinions of cadres and masses at different levels are not listened to much.

The degree of openness of feedback is low. Some units do not even feedback the evaluation conclusions and rectification measures to cadres and the masses.

Neglecting transformation. Once the evaluation is over, everything is fine, neglecting the implementation of rectification measures.

The above problems, to varying degrees, directly affect the effectiveness of democratic evaluation. Therefore, the following corresponding measures must be taken:

Strengthen the awareness of public supervision and democratic supervision, and create a good atmosphere of democratic supervision and public supervision. As an organizational department, it is necessary to further publicize the significance and role of implementing democratic evaluation, so that everyone can clearly understand that all cadres of the Party and the state are "public servants" of the people and must accept the supervision of the people. Implementing democratic evaluation can promote cadres to form the habit of actively accepting supervision from the masses, so that the masses can better establish the idea of being masters.

Increase the transparency of the evaluation results as much as possible. Democratic evaluation work is a mass activity, and the transparency will directly affect the effectiveness of the evaluation work. The situation of the masses voting for leading cadres, the evaluation of the advantages and disadvantages of the leading cadres by the masses, should be publicly reported. That is, not only should the leading cadres be fed back individually, but also the evaluation results should be reported to cadres and masses within the corresponding evaluation scope, and the rectification measures of the leading cadres should be reported to the masses when reporting the evaluation results to the masses.

Further improve the objectivity and reliability of evaluation information. Evaluation information mainly includes the opinions of mass evaluation and organizational investigation. The objectivity and accuracy of evaluation information directly affect the quality and effectiveness of democratic evaluation work. Therefore, first, it is necessary to reasonably arrange the evaluators. Based on the principle that leading cadres report to the job unit, during the reporting and evaluation, not only the relevant leading organs at higher levels (such as the government, the people's congress) and the subordinate leading cadres in this region and this unit should participate, but also a certain proportion of mass representatives who are familiar with the situation of the evaluated cadres and have certain political consultation capabilities should be arranged to attend the evaluation as observers. Second, the investigation team should be mainly composed of comrades from the higher-level organizational departments. Increase the breadth and depth of the investigation, and listen to the opinions of various parties as much as possible.

Focus on the "main event" after the evaluation results are reported. On the basis of reporting the results of democratic evaluation to leading cadres and the masses, it is necessary to adjust the positions of some cadres, and make efforts in the "transformation" of evaluation results. As an organizational department, first, it is necessary to implement classified guidance in measures, not only to make each leading cadre understand their strengths and weaknesses, but also to pay attention to the organic combination of evaluation with the training of cadres' positions and duties, so that democratic evaluation can truly become a "filling station" for cadres' progress. Second, it is necessary to pay attention to the feedback of the masses on democratic evaluation, grasp the situation of the leading cadres' rectification and implementation of relevant issues, and especially grasp the degree of acceptance of rectification by individual leading cadres who have been given a "yellow card" warning. Third, it is necessary to introduce a competitive mechanism and reflect the principle of survival of the fittest. Through democratic evaluation, in order to strengthen the construction of the leading cadres, it is necessary to seriously implement the principles of openness, democracy, equality, and selection of the best, to adjust the positions of unqualified leading cadres, and to make timely and appropriate adjustments to individual cadres who have been given a "yellow card" warning and have not improved after the expiration of the period; at the same time, it is necessary to let outstanding talents stand out, so as to encourage cadres to strive for progress.

　　改革完善评议干部工作
    吴淦新
    民主评议领导干部，对于完善和扩大党内民主，客观准确地了解和使用干部，提高领导班子的整体效能和干部的素质，起到了良好的积极作用。
    如何进一步改革和完善民主评议工作，使这种好形式取得更好的效果呢？目前，除了在理论上要对民主评议的内容、定性定量测评的科学性进一步研究完善外，还需认真研究解决评议过程中出现的一些问题。
    干部群众对民主评议的认识不足，心理承受能力还比较脆弱。有些领导干部怕影响自己的威信，影响正常工作的开展，经不起群众评议；群众怕评不好，走走形式没有效果；还是少搞为好。
    评议的深度和广度不够。有些单位的干部和群众对评议者的情况不甚了解，有的参政议政能力不强。有的组织人事部门的考察小组像“联合调查组”，考察人员多是临时抽调的，对被考察干部不太熟悉。考察的面不宽，听取不同层次干部群众的意见不多。
    反馈的开放程度偏低。有些单位甚至连评议结论和整改措施也不向干部和群众反馈。
    忽视转化。评议一过，万事大吉，忽视落实整改措施。
    上述问题，不同程度地直接影响民主评议的效果。为此，必须采取以下一些相应措施：
    强化公开监督、民主监督意识，造成一个良好的民主监督、公开监督的大气候。作为组织部门，要进一步宣传实行民主评议的意义、作用，使大家明确党和国家的所有干部，都是人民的“公仆”，都必须接受人民的监督。实行民主评议，促使干部养成自觉接受群众监督的习惯，从而使群众更好地树立主人翁的思想。
    尽可能地增强评议结果的透明度。民主评议工作是群众性的活动，透明度如何，将直接影响评议工作的效果。对于群众投领导干部的信任票情况，群众对领导班子的优劣评价情况，应公开通报。即不仅要向领导干部逐个反馈，还要在相应的评议范围内向干部群众通报，并在向群众通报评议结果时，通报领导班子的整改措施。
    进一步提高评价信息的客观可靠性。评价信息，主要包括群众评估和组织考察的意见。评价信息的客观性和准确度，直接影响到民主评议的工作质量和效果。为此，一要合理安排评议人员。以领导干部向任职机关述职为原则，在述职和评议时，不仅上级有关领导机关（如政府、人大）、本地区、本单位的下属领导干部要参加，还需安排一定比例的对被评议者情况比较了解、并有一定议政能力的群众代表参加旁听评议。二是考察的队伍应以上级组织部门的同志为主体。增加考察广度和深度，尽可能多听各方面的意见。
    抓好通报评议结果后的“重头戏”。在向领导干部和群众通报民主评议结果的基础上，有必要对一些干部进行职务调整，在评议成果的“转化”上狠下功夫。作为组织部门，一要在措施上实行因人而异，分类指导。不仅要使每个领导干部认识自己的长处和不足，而且还应注意把评议与干部的岗位职务培训有机地结合起来，使民主评议真正成为干部前进途中的“加油站”。二要重视群众对民主评议的信息反馈，掌握领导班子对有关问题的整改落实情况，尤其是要有重点地掌握好个别领导干部被“黄牌”警告后接受整改的程度。三要引入竞争机制，体现优胜劣汰。通过民主评议，围绕加强领导班子的建设，认真贯彻公开、民主、平等、择优的原则，对不合格的领导干部要进行职务调整，对个别已被“黄牌”警告到期仍无改进表现的干部也要果断及时地作出适当调整；同时，要让优秀人才脱颖而出，以激励干部奋发进取。
