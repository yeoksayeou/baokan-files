	Technological development and basic research complement each other
    The Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, forms a positive cycle

    According to a report from our correspondent He Huangbiao: A powerful force in the field of automation and information science research in China—the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences—is forming a new situation where basic research and application development support each other and form a positive cycle. That is, the technology and achievements formed by applied basic research support product development, while the revenue from product operations enables the institute to have the funds to support applied basic research.

    Since 1983, the Institute of Automation has gradually shifted its focus to development work, and has implemented the policy of focusing on development while paying attention to and supporting applied basic research. The institute has organized and mobilized about 80% of its technical personnel to engage in the main battlefield of national economic construction, actively undertake national key scientific and technological attack tasks, directly transform scientific and technological achievements into commodities, and establish the China Automation Technology Company to engage in development, production, and operation. At the same time, the institute has retained a small, high-level research team to track and study high technologies in the field. After several years of effort, the Institute of Automation has made significant progress in both areas. Since 1983, it has achieved 109 scientific and technological achievements, of which 32 have been awarded by the Academy and provincial and municipal governments. Among these achievements, many are applied basic achievements, such as pattern description and expression methods, control system reliability analysis and synthesis, and encouraging strategies and their applications for the ecological economic zoning of the Beijing-Tianjin region. In terms of product development, the high-resolution microcomputer graphics workstation, image processing system, and digital display developed by the Institute of Automation are all mass-produced, with an annual output value of over 10 million yuan. The annual sales volume of the China Automation Technology Company has grown from 1.5 million yuan in its early days in 1985 to 100 million yuan in 1988. The research institute's self-raised funds have reached the level of the operational funds allocated by the former Chinese Academy of Sciences.

    A significant portion of the basic research projects at the Institute of Automation are applied basic research projects with clear application backgrounds. These studies have supported or will support the development of high-tech products. When planning the development of technological products, the institute not only focuses on existing technological accumulations or mature unit technologies, organizing technical personnel to commercialize them and push them to the market, but also aims at the basic research that must be broken through for the development of second-generation and third-generation high-tech products.

    In research institutes that focus on applications, basic research is easily neglected. To address this, the institute has taken special measures to support and encourage researchers engaged in basic research. Since 1985, they have actively sought support from higher authorities, and 30 topics have successively received support from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the National Natural Science Foundation. This year, they have also established a fund within the institute to increase the investment intensity of basic research topics and support basic research topics with new ideas, new viewpoints, and new trends among postdoctoral fellows and young scientific and technological personnel.

　　技术开发与基础研究相得益彰    
    中科院自动化所形成良性循环
    本报讯  记者何黄彪报道：我国自动化和信息科学研究领域中的一支生力军——中国科学院自动化研究所正在形成基础研究与应用开发良性循环、相互支持的新局面，即应用基础研究形成的技术和成果支持了产品开发，而产品经营所取得的收益使研究所有可能腾出经费支持应用基础研究。
    １９８３年以来，自动化研究所逐步把工作重点转向开发工作，并执行在重点抓好开发工作的同时重视应用基础研究、给予积极支持与扶植的方针。所里一面组织动员８０％左右的科技人员投入国民经济建设主战场，积极承担国家重点科技攻关任务，把科技成果直接转化为商品，并创办中国自动化技术公司从事开发、生产和经营。与此同时，所内保留了一支精干的高水平的研究力量，从事本领域的高技术跟踪和研究。经过近几年的努力，自动化所在这两方面都取得了较大的发展，１９８３年以来，共取得科技成果１０９项，其中获院和省市奖励的成果３２项。这些成果中，不少是应用基础成果，如模式描述与表达方法，控制系统可靠性分析与综合，京津地区生态经济区划鼓励性对策及其应用。在产品开发方面，自动化所开发的高分辨率微机图形工作站、图像处理系统、光栅数显表等产品均批量生产，年产值已超过１０００万元。中自公司的年销售额从１９８５年初创时的１５０万元，发展到１９８８年的１亿元。研究所自筹经费收入，已达到改革前科学院拨发的事业费水平。
    自动化所的基础研究项目，很大部分属于有明确应用背景的应用基础研究项目。这些研究已为或将为高技术产品的开发提供支持。该所在规划开发技术产品时，不仅着力于原有的技术积累或成熟的单元技术，组织科技人员使之商品化，推向市场，还着眼于第二代、第三代高技术产品开发所必需突破的基础研究。
    在以应用为主的研究所中，基础研究易被忽视。为此，所里采取一些特殊措施，对从事基础研究的科研人员给予支持和鼓励。从１９８５年以来，他们积极向上级争取，已有３０个课题先后取得了中科院和国家自然科学基金会的支持。今年以来，又在所内设立基金，以提高基础研究课题投资强度，并支持博士后及青年科技人员中有新思想、新观点、新苗头的基础研究课题。
