The New First Lady of the White House

Mù Fēng

On January 20, George Bush was inaugurated as the 41st President of the United States, and his wife, Barbara, became the new First Lady of the United States—the mistress of the White House.

The 63-year-old Barbara, with her silver hair, elegant demeanor, sincere and straightforward manner, and modest attire, is seen by the American media as someone who will bring a new style to the role of First Lady. As she recently said, "After being George Bush's wife for 43 years, I can handle any job. I don't think being the First Lady will change me; I'll still be the same wife. I don't see the White House making any difference to me." She even explicitly stated that she would not be the hostess of receptions in the White House. She said, "First of all, I want to be a good wife and mother, and I have always been a good wife and mother. My husband George Bush has worked in the White House, Congress, the United Nations, the Central Intelligence Agency, and other departments, but in all these positions, I have always been the same, without changing."

Barbara was born on June 8, 1925, in New York. Her father was a publisher and the editor of McCall's magazine. She spent her happy childhood in a wealthy family and later attended Smith College, a prestigious women's college in the United States. As a teenager, Barbara was tall and graceful, with dark red hair. At 17, she met George Bush at a Christmas dance. Barbara recalled, "When he (Bush) walked into the hall, I stopped breathing... My eyes were fixed on this most handsome person." They fell in love at first sight and were married in 1945. After their marriage, they were deeply in love and lived a happy life. However, Barbara rarely involved herself in politics and seldom appeared in public. She and Bush seemed to have a very harmonious understanding: "I handle the household, and you handle your career." In the 43 years of their marriage, Barbara was a devoted wife and mother, playing the roles of a homemaker and a loving mother. During Bush's political career, they moved to 17 different cities and lived in over 30 places, as Barbara herself described it, like a ball rolling around: Texas oil fields—Capitol Hill—Senate—United Nations—Beijing—Central Intelligence Agency—White House. She and Bush have four sons and one daughter.

When asked about her future plans for life in the White House, Barbara said she had not thought of "any major plans." She only hoped that her more than ten grandchildren could often come to the White House, and she could talk with them or have meals together every day. "I will continue to manage the household and listen to the children's questions as I have done in the past." She expressed her wish to make Bush step out of the White House and mingle with ordinary people. She said, "Going out of the White House and being with the people, talking with them, is very beneficial for both of us." However, those who know Barbara well believe that after becoming the mistress of the White House, she will continue with the plan she is most interested in: "A nationwide campaign to comprehensively change the situation of illiteracy." She once said, "Every problem I am concerned about—environmental pollution, AIDS, teenage pregnancy—will be improved because the people will have higher cultural standards, be able to read, write, and understand things."

During Barbara's multiple moves with Bush, the "legendary Beijing trip" remains unforgettable and cherished. She recently told a friend, "If you ask me about the happiest time in my 43-year marriage, it would be the days we spent in Beijing. At that time, my children were all left in the United States and had grown up. Bush and I had the chance to rekindle that romantic feeling, often visiting Beijing's famous sights, which was truly very happy." "I like Beijing." From October 1974 to December 1975, George Bush served as the Chief of the U.S. Liaison Office in China, and Barbara accompanied Bush to Beijing. During those days, Barbara established an unforgettable friendship with the Chinese people. Sometimes she and Bush would ride bicycles around Beijing. The most interesting time was when the couple rode bicycles to the Chinese Foreign Ministry, leaving the guards astonished. They could hardly believe that the Chief of the U.S. Liaison Office and his wife would not ride in a special car but instead ride bicycles to visit. What did the Bush couple think? Bush said, "Why can't I only go in and out in a small car, but can't I ride a bicycle like the Chinese people and go around freely?" So, my wife Barbara and I began to ride bicycles on the streets, visit friends, and go to some Beijing offices. Not long after, our frequent bicycle rides became widely known in Beijing's diplomatic circles, and even some Beijing citizens knew that we were "the Bush couple who often ride bicycles like the Chinese people." To this day, they often take out a photo with the backdrop of Tiananmen Square, showing them riding bicycles, and reminisce about the days they spent in Beijing.

Behind a successful person in their career, there is often a supportive spouse. Barbara is George Bush's good assistant and supportive wife. She has always supported Bush's career, although she does not often appear in public. However, Washington observers all consider Barbara to be a "resolute, straightforward, and brave woman." Especially during this period when George Bush was running for the U.S. presidency, she tirelessly worked to help her husband win. Barbara's character is attractive, and now Americans know she is a reasonable and kind-hearted person, which has won her much favor. But when people ask this American First Lady what she hopes people will know about her, she straightforwardly and warmly says, "I hope people know that my heart is young and beautiful."

　　白宫新主妇
    穆风
    今年１月２０日，乔治·布什就职美国第四十一任总统，布什夫人巴巴拉就成为新任的美国“第一夫人”——白宫的女主人。
    现年６３岁的巴巴拉，满头银发，端庄典雅，待人真诚坦率，衣着朴实无华。美国舆论界认为，巴巴拉进入白宫将开创美国第一夫人的新风格。正如她最近所说：“做了乔治·布什的妻子４３年，我对什么工作都可应付得了。我不认为‘第一夫人’会把我改变，我还是往常一样的妻子。我看不到白宫对我有什么不同。”“我不会企望在白宫做宴会的女主人。我爱我的生活和我的家人。”她甚至明确表示她不会在布什白宫椭圆形办公室里进进出出。她说：“首先，我希望做个好妻子和好妈妈，而我一向也是个好妻子和好妈妈。我的丈夫乔治·布什曾在白宫、国会、联合国、中央情报局及其他部门担任工作，但在各个职位上，我一直都是这样，没有改变。”
    巴巴拉１９２５年６月８日出生于纽约，她父亲是个出版商，是《麦考尔》杂志的发行人。她在富裕的家庭中度过了幸福的童年时代，后来就读于美国颇有名望的女子学院——史密斯学院。少女时代，巴巴拉长得亭亭玉立，一头暗红色头发。她１７岁那年在一次圣诞节舞会上邂逅乔治·布什。巴巴拉回忆说：“他（布什）一走进大厅，我就停止了呼吸……我的眼睛一直盯在这位最漂亮的人身上。”他俩一见钟情，１９４５年结为伉俪。婚后他们俩柔情蜜意，生活美满。但巴巴拉很少涉足政治，也极少抛头露面，她与布什似乎有着一种十分和谐的默契：“我管家务，你搞事业。”婚后的４３年中，巴巴拉是位贤妻良母，主演着家庭主妇和慈祥母亲的角色。在布什的仕途生涯中，他们先后迁居１７个城市、在３０多个地方生活过，就像巴巴拉自己形容的那样，像一个球一样一直滚来滚去：得克萨斯油田——国会山——参议院——联合国——北京——中央情报局——白宫。她与布什生有４子１女。
    有记者问巴巴拉今后白宫的生活怎样安排？她说：她还没有想到“什么重大计划”，她只希望她的十多个儿孙能常到白宫来，每天能与他们交谈，或共同进餐。“我会像过去一样，料理家务，听听孩子们的问题。”她表示她有一个愿望，就是要使布什走出白宫，和普通人打成一片。她说：“到白宫外面走走，与人民在一起，和他们交谈，对我们俩有很大好处。”但是了解巴巴拉的人都认为，她成为白宫女主人之后仍将继续她最有兴趣的计划：“一个全面改变文盲情况的全国性运动。”她曾说过：“每个我所担心的问题——环境污染、艾滋病、女童未婚怀孕——都将因为人民提高文化，能读、能写和能领悟事情而得到改善。”
    在巴巴拉随同布什先后多次的迁移中，“传奇的北京之旅”至今使她恋恋不舍、回味无穷。她最近对朋友说：“假如问我４３年婚姻生活中最愉快的时光，那么就是派驻北京的那些日子。当时我的孩子全留在美国，他们都长大了。我与布什俩有机会重温那份神仙眷属的悠闲，经常游览北京名胜，真是非常快乐。”“我喜欢北京。”１９７４年１０月至１９７５年１２月，乔治·布什出任美国驻中国联络处主任，巴巴拉随布什来到了北京。在那些日子里，巴巴拉与中国人民结下了难忘的友谊。有时她与布什骑自行车到北京四处游逛。最有趣的一次是他们夫妇俩骑着自行车来到中国外交部，使门卫为之愕然，他们难以相信美国联络处主任夫妇竟不坐专车而骑自行车来访。而布什夫妇是怎么想的呢？布什说，为什么我只能坐小汽车出出进进，而不能像中国人那样骑自行车自由自在地到处跑跑呢？于是，我和妻子巴巴拉便开始骑自行车上街、看朋友，到北京一些机关。没过多久，我们常骑自行车外出一事就在北京外交界广为流传，就连北京一些市民也知道我和巴巴拉是“和中国人一样经常骑自行车的布什夫妇”了。迄今，他们还经常拿出一张背景是天安门的骑自行车的照片给朋友们观赏（见上图），回忆着在北京所度过的那些时日。
    一位在事业上获得成就的人，他的背后往往有一位贤内助。巴巴拉就是乔治·布什的好助手与贤内助。她一贯支持布什的事业，虽然她不经常在公众场合露面，但华盛顿的观察家们都认为巴巴拉是一位“不气馁、率直而勇敢的妇女”。尤其在这次乔治·布什竞选美国总统期间，她始终为她丈夫争取获胜而竭力奔走。巴巴拉的性格是具有吸引力的，现在美国人都知道她是一位通情达理，和蔼可亲的人，因而颇得人心。但当人们问及这位美国第一夫人希望人们了解她的什么情况时，她率直而热情地说：“但愿人们了解我的内心是年轻而美丽的。”
