Zhejiang has successfully developed two new late-rice varieties, XiuShui 620 and XiuShui 664, which can resist brown planthopper, rice blast, and white leaf blight without the use of pesticides.

According to the Jiaxing City Crop Variety Appraisal Committee, these two new varieties have excellent grain quality and high yield potential. In 1987 and 1988, regional trials showed that their average yield per mu was 3% to 10% higher than the current leading varieties. Even during the severe brown planthopper outbreaks in 1987 and 1988, these varieties remained unaffected without the application of pesticides.

Rice blast, white leaf blight, and brown planthopper are three major pests that have long plagued farmers in Zhejiang. Particularly, brown planthopper has been a significant challenge, with the only effective control measure previously being the use of insecticides. This approach not only increases agricultural costs but also risks contaminating farmlands and rice.

To address this issue, led by breeding expert Yao Haigen, the late-rice breeding team at the Jiaxing City Agricultural Science Institute began large-scale hybrid breeding experiments in the mid-1970s. By transferring the brown planthopper-resistant genes from indica rice varieties, they successfully developed the "three-resistant" late-rice varieties, which are resistant to rice blast, white leaf blight, and brown planthopper. Variety XiuShui 620 has excellent resistance to brown planthopper, with natural pest levels being only 1/10 to 1/15 of ordinary varieties. Variety XiuShui 664 has an 80% or higher resistance rate.

　　浙江育成两个晚粳新品种    
    不用农药亦可抗褐稻虱等病虫害
    本报讯  一种不用农药就能抗褐稻虱虫，抗稻瘟病、白叶枯病的“三抗”晚粳新品种——秀水６２０和秀水６６４，在浙江省嘉兴市农科所育成。
    据嘉兴市农作物品种审定小组公布的材料：这两个新品种米质优，丰产性好，经１９８７年、１９８８年区域试验，平均亩产分别比目前的当家品种增产３％到１０％。在褐稻虱大爆发的１９８７年、１９８８年两个年头，不施用农药，它们仍安然无恙。
    稻瘟病、白叶枯病、褐稻虱是困扰浙江农家的三大水稻病虫害，尤其是褐稻虱，国内外以往唯一的有效防治办法，就是采用杀虫剂，既增加农业成本，农田、稻米也容易受到一定程度的污染。
    为解决这一难题，以育种专家姚海根为主的浙江嘉兴市农科所晚粳育种组从７０年代中期开始，着手进行大规模的杂交试验。他们通过移植籼稻品种中的抗褐稻虱基因，进而培育出抗稻瘟病、白叶枯病和抗褐稻虱的“三抗”晚粳新品种。经品种鉴定和区域试验，秀水６２０具有良好的抗褐稻虱性能，自然虫量只有一般品种的１／１０到１／１５；秀水６６４抗虫效果达到８０％以上。
