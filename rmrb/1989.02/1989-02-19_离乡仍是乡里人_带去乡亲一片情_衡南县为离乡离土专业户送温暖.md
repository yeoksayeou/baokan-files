    Still Villagers Though Away from Home: Carrying the Affection of Fellow Villagers
    Hengnan County Sends Warmth to Specialized Households Who Have Left Their Hometowns

    People's Daily reports: Hengnan County, Hunan Province, places great emphasis on the education, management, and service of migrant workers and businesspeople. Over the past year, the county's Party committee and government have organized more than a hundred cadres to visit over a thousand specialized households in 13 provinces and cities, bringing with them the Party's policies and the affection of their hometown families. They held discussions to help these households improve their understanding of policies, solve practical problems, and protect their legal rights.

    In recent years, Hengnan County has actively encouraged skilled workers to leave their hometowns to work and do business. In 1988, more than 2,500 specialized households were spread across 23 provinces and cities, engaged in 36 different industries, creating a production value of 270 million yuan and paying nearly 50 million yuan in taxes to the state. In the past, once farmers left their hometowns, they would no longer care about anything, leading some specialized households to think, "Whoever has the ability makes money, whether it's legal or not." In 1987, the county received 1,574 letters from outside, of which 1,135 reflected issues of tax evasion by specialized households. To instill in them the idea of "working hard to get rich and abiding by the law to get rich" and to strengthen their sense of law and order, the county sent cadres to give targeted lectures on laws and regulations such as the "Tax Law," "Criminal Law," and "Regulations on Administrative Penalties for Public Security."

    At the same time, the county's Party committee and government stand up for the rights of those who have gone out, helping them recover economic losses.

    A construction specialized household from Jingshan Township paid income tax at the local tax bureau last year, but did not obtain a certificate when going to work outside, and the local tax bureau again levied an income tax of over 11,000 yuan. He refused to pay, resulting in the detention of over 400,000 yuan in construction funds, making it impossible for him to continue production. The county immediately sent cadres to negotiate, preventing unnecessary losses.

    The county also represents specialized households to resolve misunderstandings with local industrial and commercial administrative departments. The county has many construction specialized households in Guangxi and Yunnan. In the past, due to incomplete procedures issued by the township government, some people were suspected by the local authorities and even not given work or a place to stay. The county sent cadres to explain to the relevant local departments, taking responsibility for them and completing the procedures, allowing them to focus on production.

    For specialized households that have made mistakes, the county warmly helps them correct their errors and restart production. A specialized household from Xiangxi Township, Yang, had previously made legal and disciplinary mistakes and was about to "lie down and let the mud settle." Township cadres timely visited him, helping him summarize his experiences and lessons. Now, this specialized household not only paid off debts and became rich but also became a model specialized household for abiding by laws and regulations.

　　离乡仍是乡里人　带去乡亲一片情    
    衡南县为离乡离土专业户送温暖
    本报讯  湖南省衡南县重视对外出务工经商人员的教育、管理、服务。去年以来，县委、县政府先后组织上百名干部带着党的政策，家乡父老兄弟一片情意分赴１３个省、市、上千名专业户家里座谈，帮助他们提高政策水平，解决实际困难，维护合法权益。
    近年来，衡南县积极鼓励能工巧匠离乡离土务工经商，１９８８年，有２５００多专业户散布在全国２３个省、市３６个不同行业中务工经商，创造产值２．７亿元，上交国家税利近５００万元。过去农民离了乡，便什么都不管了，致使一些专业户产生“谁有本事谁发财，管它乱来不乱来”的思想。１９８７年，该县共收到外地来信１５７４封，其中有１１３５封反映专业户在外偷税漏税。为使他们树立“勤劳致富、守法致富”观念，增强法纪意识，该县派出干部在外地有针对性地宣讲《税法》、《刑法》、《治安管理处罚条例》等法律、法规。
    同时，县委、县政府为外出人员撑腰作主，帮助追回经济损失。
    京山乡一建筑专业户去年在本地税务所交纳了所得税，但去外地施工未开证明，当地税务部门又向其征所得税１１０００多元，他不交，结果４０余万元基建款被扣，无法生产。县里立即派干部出面交涉，挽回了不必要的损失。
    县里还代表专业户向当地工商行政管理部门解嫌释疑。该县在广西、云南的建筑专业户较多，过去由于乡政府给他们外出的手续不完整，有些人受当地怀疑，甚至不给工做，不给地方住宿，县里派干部向当地有关部门解释，为他们承担责任，并补办手续，使他们放心搞生产。
    对于“栽跟头”的专业户，县里热情帮助他们改正错误，重整旗鼓发展生产。相西乡外出专业户杨某过去违法乱纪栽了“跟头”，正当他准备“高倒塘泥任它下”时，乡干部及时找上门，帮助他总结经验教训。现在，这个专业户不但还了债致了富，还成为遵纪守法的模范专业户。
