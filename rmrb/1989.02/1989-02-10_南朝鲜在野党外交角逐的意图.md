South Korea's opposition parties are engaging in diplomatic rivalry with clear intentions.

	• Advancing diplomatic offensives to gain political capital
	• Promoting their own agendas to expand international influence
	• Criticizing government policies to counter the regime's influence

In late January and early February, the leaders of South Korea's three opposition parties—the Democratic Party's Kim Young-sam, the Republican Party's Kim Jong-pil, and the Peace Democratic Party's Kim Dae-jung—successively visited Japan, the United States, and Europe. This is the first time in South Korea's history that the leaders of three opposition parties have left Seoul for visits abroad in such a short period. This marks a new phase in the political rivalry among South Korea's opposition parties.

Due to long-term military dictatorship, South Korea's opposition parties have never gained the position they deserve. However, under the common goal of opposing the dictatorship, they have cooperated and united. In December 1987, during South Korea's first direct presidential election, both the People's Party and the Democratic Party nearly defeated the Democratic Justice Party. In the 13th National Assembly elections last April, the opposition parties controlled the National Assembly for the first time.

This time, the opposition parties' diplomatic rivalry has three main objectives. First, to advance South Korea's diplomatic offensives, expand economic cooperation, and thereby gain political capital. Kim Young-sam in Japan not only met with the leadership of the opposition Social Party but also held talks with the Liberal Democratic Party's Secretary-General and Chairman of the General Council. They discussed bilateral relations and issues in Northeast Asia. Kim Jong-pil visited the United States at the invitation of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, mainly to discuss resolving trade frictions between South Korea and the United States. Kim Dae-jung in Europe focused on exploring economic development relations between South Korea and the European Community. If their visits are successful, they will be welcomed in South Korea and gain prestige for their parties.

Second, to promote their own party's agendas and expand international influence. In the past, the three opposition parties have been busy with internal struggles and expanding their influence. After Roh Tae-woo announced the implementation of "non-partisan diplomacy" in November, the opposition parties shifted their competition to the international stage. Kim Young-sam in Japan advocated that the Democratic Party's "main goal is not radical democracy but the establishment of a stable democracy." Kim Jong-pil in the United States, however, advocated his party's sympathy for Roh Tae-woo and opposition to the "interim assessment" of Roh Tae-woo through a "vote of confidence," which aligns with U.S. intentions.

Third, to counter Roh Tae-woo's political influence. According to the plan, in mid-March, South Korea will hold a vote of confidence on Roh Tae-woo's first year in office. Kim Dae-jung and Kim Young-sam both want to use this opportunity to weaken Roh Tae-woo's internal and external influence. They both criticized Roh Tae-woo during their visits abroad.

In fact, South Korea's three opposition parties have taken a unified stance on settling the Fifth Republic's (Chun Doo-hwan's regime) corruption cases and demanding that Roh Tae-woo implement democratization measures. This will have an impact on the development of South Korea's political situation.

### 南朝鲜在野党外交角逐的意图

　　南朝鲜在野党外交角逐的意图
    新华社记者　黎能清
    ●推进外交攻势　获取政治资本
    ●宣传各自主张　扩大国际影响
    ●批评政府政策　抵消当局作用
    在１月底２月初，南朝鲜在野的民主党总裁金泳三、共和党总裁金钟泌和和平民主党总裁金大中相继出访日本、美国和欧洲。南朝鲜３个在野党领导人在短期内相继离开汉城出访，这是南朝鲜有史以来的第一次。这是南朝鲜在野党之间政治角逐的新拓展。
    南朝鲜由于长期实行军事独裁统治，在野党一直没有取得应有的地位。但在反对独裁统治这一共同目标下，他们进行了合作与团结。１９８７年１２月，南朝鲜第一次举行直接总统选举时，平民党和民主党都险些击败民正党。在去年４月的第１３届国会议员选举中，第一次出现了在野党控制国会的局面。
    这次在野党开展外交角逐有三个目的。一是推进南朝鲜的外交攻势，扩大经济合作，从而捞取政治资本。金泳三在日本不仅与在野的社会党领导人进行了会晤，还与执政的自民党干事长、总务会长举行了会谈。双方讨论了双边关系、东北亚地区问题等。金钟泌应美国参议院外交委员会的邀请访美，主要探讨解决南朝鲜和美国的贸易摩擦等问题。金大中在欧洲则侧重探索南朝鲜与西欧共同体的经济发展关系问题。如果访问获得成功，他们将会在南朝鲜内部受到欢迎，为自己的政党赢得声誉。
    二是宣传各自政党的主张，扩大国际影响。过去，３个在野党一直忙于内部争斗，发展势力。去年１１月，卢泰愚宣布实行“超党派外交”后，在野党又把竞争的场地转向国际舞台。金泳三在日本宣传说，民主党的“主要目标不是激进的民主主义，而是树立稳健的民主主义”。而金钟泌在美国却宣传自己的党同情卢泰愚，反对对卢泰愚的“中间评估”搞“信任投票”。这与美国的意愿相吻合。
    三是抵消卢泰愚的政治作用。按计划，３月中旬，南朝鲜将对卢泰愚进行执政一年来的信任投票。金大中、金泳三都想利用这个机会削弱卢泰愚的内外影响。他们在出访中都发表了批评卢泰愚的谈话。
    事实表明，南朝鲜的３个在野党在清算第５共和国（全斗焕执政时期）舞弊案和要求卢泰愚实行民主化措施问题上，采取了一致的立场。这将对南朝鲜政局的发展产生影响。
