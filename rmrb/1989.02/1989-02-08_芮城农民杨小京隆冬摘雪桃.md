	In the depths of winter, farmers along the Yellow River in Ruicheng County, Shanxi Province, are harvesting fresh peaches with a golden hue and reddish tint.

	This variety of peach resembles summer peaches in shape. Three years ago, Yang Xiaojing purchased 300 saplings of winter peach trees from a valley in Ankang County, Shaanxi Province, south of the Qinling Mountains, and began cultivating them in his courtyard and leased land. Now, 10 acres are bearing fruit, yielding over 10,000 kilograms of fresh peaches, with earnings of 200,000 yuan. This year, another 300 trees will also bear fruit.

	These winter peaches bloom in March with pale red flowers and bear fruit in April, but they grow slowly. They ripen around the time of the "Xiaoxue" (a solar term around mid-November), hence the name snow peaches. These peaches are firmer than summer peaches but have a higher sugar content. Historically, they were imperial tribute.

　　芮城农民杨小京隆冬摘雪桃
    新华社太原电  （通讯员谢项登）隆冬季节，黄河岸边的山西芮城县农民杨小京收获着黄中透红的鲜桃。
    这种鲜桃形状和夏桃相同。三年前杨小京从秦岭以南的陕西安康县的一个山沟里买回３００棵冬桃树苗，开始在自己家院和承包地里栽培。现在已有１０亩结果，摘鲜桃１万多公斤，收入２万元。今年另有３００多株可结果。
    这种冬桃３月开花，花色淡红；４月结果，但长得很慢。到“小雪”前后才成熟，又称雪桃。这种桃吃起来比夏桃硬，但含糖量却比夏桃高。过去曾是皇帝的贡品。
