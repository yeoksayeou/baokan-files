Bulgarian economist Stoimenov recently published an article in the Bulgarian weekly "Economic Life" criticizing new customs restrictions imposed by some CMEA countries that prohibit tourists from carrying a series of items out of the country. The article was reprinted by the Soviet newspaper "Pravda" yesterday.

The article points out that the new customs restrictions imposed by countries such as Bulgaria, the German Democratic Republic, Poland, and Czechoslovakia at the end of 1988 are contrary to the idea of establishing a unified market among CMEA countries proposed at the 43rd CMEA meeting. Regardless of the motives, from the perspective of developing socialist economic integration and reforming this integration mechanism, such actions are a step backward in the process of comprehensive cooperation, a retreat from the collective measures that have already been approved.

The article states that in recent years, some CMEA countries have unilaterally and without any coordination set the amount of foreign exchange that their citizens can exchange when traveling abroad. Some countries seem to deliberately direct part of the purchasing power that their residents cannot satisfy to the markets of other countries. This violates the principle of coordinated action among CMEA countries. Unfortunately, there was no such coordination when implementing the new customs regulations.

### 保经济学家发表文章　批评经互会国家间的“海关战”

    批评经互会国家间的“海关战”
    本报柏林２月２０日电  记者许宏治报道：保加利亚经济学家斯托伊梅诺夫最近在保加利亚周刊《经济生活报》上发表文章，对一些经互会国家采取的禁止旅游者携带一系列物品出境的新的海关限制措施提出不同意见。苏联《真理报》昨天转载了这篇文章。
    文章指出，保加利亚、民主德国、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克等国于１９８８年底采取的新的海关限制措施是与经互会第４３次会议提出的建立经互会国家统一市场的思想背道而驰的。不论出于何种动机，从发展社会主义经济一体化和改革这种一体化的机制的观点来看，这种行动都是在全面合作过程中的一种倒退，是从已经通过的集体措施后退。
    文章说，近年来，一些经互会国家未经任何协调地自行规定了本国公民出国旅行时可兑换的外汇数额。一些国家似乎有意识地把本国居民得不到满足的购买力的一部分引向别国市场。在这方面违反了经互会国家协调行动的原则。遗憾的是，在实行新的海关规定时也没有进行这种协调。
