The Feilong (Group) Company Spends Less and Achieves More with High Efficiency

From our reporter Jiang Xia: The Feilong (Group) Company, a large agricultural enterprise group in Hebei Province, was established just over half a year ago. With a small amount of new state investment, it has adjusted, renovated, and utilized a large number of idle fixed assets in rural areas over the past few years. By building and generating revenue simultaneously, it has achieved remarkable economic benefits with less spending and more accomplishments.

The Feilong (Group) Company in Hebei Province is a joint venture between the China Rural Trust and Investment Corporation and Hebei Province, primarily engaged in the development and operation of rural economies. From the beginning, they have focused on seeking high-efficiency investment methods that spend less and achieve more. To develop grain-saving livestock and poultry production and provide more reasonably priced meat products to society, the group implemented a broiler series project in Hebei. According to the general approach, a design scale of producing 100 million broilers per year requires state investment of as much as 93 million yuan. However, the Feilong (Group) Company, following the integrated input approach of capital, technology, talent, system, and market, used only 18 million yuan of state investment as a catalyst. Through methods such as joint ventures, contracting, leasing, and mergers, it reorganized 16 related existing enterprises in Huailai, Xiongxian, Pingshan, and the suburbs of Shijiazhuang, making 60 million yuan of previously underutilized assets generate benefits. The basic framework for a series of projects producing 130 million broilers per year has been initially formed.

The Pingshan Chicken Factory in Pingshan Town, Pingshan County, had considerable strength in equipment and technology in the past. However, due to the lack of a stable chicken source and working capital, as well as low management levels, it often operated intermittently and could not fully utilize its production capacity. After the Feilong Group's Pingshan Company invested two-thirds of the shares to operate the factory jointly, it solved the chicken source and working capital problems for the factory and participated in its management. With little expenditure, it got the factory running. Currently, it produces over 1,000 kilograms of halal roasted chicken per day, which is in high demand in the market.

In the latter half of last year, the group planned and systematically carried out the renovation, expansion, and new construction of the parent stock farm, several grandparent stock farms, feed processing plants, broiler slaughtering and cold processing, and sales systems. During the construction, it provided over 600 tons of meat products to society, increased farmers' income by over 100 million yuan, achieved a production value of 220 million yuan, and a profit of over 20 million yuan.

　　利用农村闲散固定资产　寻求高效投资方式    
    飞龙（集团）公司少花钱多办事效益高
    本报讯  记者江夏报道：成立仅半年多的河北省大型农业企业集团飞龙（集团）公司，以少量国家新投资，对农村过去多年形成的大量闲散的固定资产进行调整、改造和利用，边建设、边创收，取得了少花钱，多办事的明显经济效益。
    河北省飞龙（集团）公司是中国农村信托投资公司与河北省合资兴办的，主要从事农村经济的开发和经营活动，一开始他们就立足于探求少花钱多办事的高效益投资方式。为了发展节粮型畜禽生产，向社会提供更多价格合理的肉食品，该集团公司在河北实施肉鸡系列化工程项目。按照一般方式，年产１０００万只肉鸡的设计规模，需要国家投资高达９３００万元，而飞龙（集团）公司按照资金、技术、人才、制度、市场等要素综合配套投入的思路，仅以１８００万元的国家投资为引子，采取合股、承包、租赁、兼并等方式，重组了怀来、雄县、平山和石家庄郊区１６个有关的原有企业，使６０００多万元原有的未充分发挥效益的资产经过调整发挥了效益，年生产１３００万只肉鸡的系列工程基本框架初步形成。平山县平山镇扒鸡厂，过去虽然在设备和技术上有一定实力，但因为既无稳定鸡源，又无流动资金，管理水平很低，经常开开停停，生产能力不能正常发挥。飞龙集团平山公司以２／３股份与该厂合资经营后，为其解决鸡源和流动资金问题，并参与管理，花钱不多，就使这个厂运转起来，目前日生产１０００多公斤清真扒鸡，在市场上供不应求。
    去年下半年，这个集团公司有计划、有步骤地进行了祖代鸡场、若干父母代鸡场、饲料加工厂、肉鸡屠宰和冷藏深加工、销售系统等的改建、扩建、新建，并在建设中，向社会提供肉食品６００多吨，增加农户收入１００多万元，实现产值２２００万元、利润２００多万元。
