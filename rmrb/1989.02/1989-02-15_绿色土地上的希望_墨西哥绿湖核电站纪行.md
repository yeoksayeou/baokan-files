Hope on the Green Land: A Journey to Mexico's Laguna Verde Nuclear Power Plant
By Guo Weicheng, People's Daily Reporter

Opening a map of Mexico, even with a magnifying glass, you won't find Laguna Verde. "The water may not be deep, but it is sacred." Since Mexico's first nuclear power plant was built there, Laguna Verde has become a household name. However, I did not expect that Laguna Verde is truly nestled in a world of green. The vibrant green lake blends seamlessly with the green fields and forests. Here, nature seems to have poured out its green emotions, embracing a set of buildings that gleam brightly in the sunlight. That is the Laguna Verde Nuclear Power Plant. Thanks to an invitation from the Mexican Federal Electricity Commission, I had the opportunity to visit this nuclear power plant that Mexicans are proud of.

It was in the main plant building of the Laguna Verde Unit 1 reactor. Nearby, the breeze carried whispers from the Caribbean Sea of the Gulf of Mexico; from the dense canopy, the song of the thrushes could be heard. We put on safety helmets, passed through the security check, and the small-statured engineer Luis began to introduce the construction of the nuclear power plant. We took the elevator to the seventh floor of the reactor main plant building and then climbed two more narrow ladders. From this high vantage point, the interior of the plant was clearly visible. The nuclear reactor is placed in a circular deep pit, with a diameter of 42 meters at the mouth and a total depth of 71 meters, with 11 meters underground. To the right of the pit is the steam auxiliary machinery, and to the left is the fuel pit. A yellow crane moves back and forth, lifting the enriched uranium from the fuel pit, which is placed in long aluminum tubes, and inserting it into the reactor. Luis told us that a total of 90 tons of enriched uranium is needed. Once operational, it will consume 18 tons of uranium per year. To prevent nuclear leaks, the upper layer of the fuel pit is 10 meters deep water, and the nuclear fuel is placed 20 meters below the water in the shaft. The Laguna Verde Nuclear Power Plant uses American technology with a boiling water reactor, cooled by light water; the enormous steam power generated by the reactor drives the operation of the turbine generator, producing electricity. In addition to the completed Unit 1 reactor, the Unit 2 reactor is under construction. Each unit has a capacity of 654,000 kilowatts, and the annual electricity generation of the two reactors is 4 billion kilowatt-hours.

So far, Mexico's electricity mainly comes from oil, with some hydroelectric and geothermal power. It is expected that by the early 1990s, electricity demand will increase, while oil production and reserves will become increasingly limited. Therefore, the Mexican government, seizing the opportunity, conducted a feasibility study on the construction of nuclear power plants and began construction of the Laguna Verde Nuclear Power Plant in 1976. After more than a decade of effort, the Unit 1 reactor was completed in October 1988. This is a strategic decision to achieve energy diversification. The spokesperson for the nuclear power plant, Engineer Cosolio, said: The Laguna Verde Nuclear Power Plant, like nuclear power plants currently under construction in various countries around the world, uses modern technology and has three safety barriers to ensure absolute safety. He added that people's fear of nuclear power plants stems from the fact that some people have experienced the painful consequences of atomic bomb attacks. In fact, the nuclear fission of an atomic bomb is completely different from the fission of a reactor. The former is uncontrolled, while the latter is strictly controlled.

In discussing this control issue, we entered the Control Room 3. In the spacious control room, the control consoles arranged in a horseshoe shape have red, green, and yellow indicator lights blinking playfully, and the computer printer spits out long strips of data paper. There are three main control consoles here, controlling the turbine generator, nuclear reactor, and auxiliary systems, respectively. The main control room is also equipped with backup generators, necessary food, medicine, kitchens, and sanitary facilities, and even a gym. In the event of a hurricane, flood, or other natural disasters, control room personnel can work inside for 20 days, ensuring the safe operation of the reactor.

The supporting facilities for Unit 1 include a radiation monitoring system and a circulating water treatment plant. The reactor's water cooling system is an independent, sealed circulation system. The cooling water flows out of the reactor, is processed by the sealed system, and then flows back into the reactor for the next cooling cycle. Therefore, the nuclear power plant will not have a harmful impact on the surrounding ecology. To ensure safety, Mexico began training professional personnel while building the Laguna Verde Nuclear Power Plant. Each operator must obtain a qualification certificate before taking up their post. During our visit, a group of trained technical personnel were conducting operational experiments.

Our visit to Laguna Verde ended at the engineering and technical staff's camp. The small houses are built by the mountain and the lake, with tennis courts and children's playgrounds where laughter can be heard, making this place look like a holiday resort. The nuclear power plant's staff and their wives and children live in this camp, just 5 kilometers from the reactor. This itself helps to dispel people's doubts about the safety of Laguna Verde. The host prepared a delicious meal with fish from the lake and shrimp from the sea to treat us. A Soviet friend among the attendees asked: "Will the fish and shrimp in this lake still be edible 20 years from now?" The host smiled and said, "Please come back in 20 years to taste them again." I looked up and gazed into the distance. Under the blue sky, the lake's rippling waves sparkled; on the other side of the lake, the expansive grasslands stretched out, and cattle roamed peacefully; laughter from children echoed through the camp. On this green land, hope for building the future is being nurtured by the Mexican people.

　　绿色土地上的希望
    ——墨西哥绿湖核电站纪行
    本报记者  郭伟成
    打开墨西哥地图，那怕用放大镜也甭想找到绿湖。“水不在深，有龙则灵”，自从在那儿建起墨西哥第一座核电站，绿湖也就家喻户晓了。然而，我没想到，绿湖真的座落在绿色的世界中，那充满生机的绿色的湖面与绿色的原野和森林融汇在一起。在这儿，大自然似乎倾注了绿色的情感，拥抱着一组在阳光下显得耀眼的红色建筑物。那就是绿湖核电站了。由于墨西哥联邦电力委员会的邀请，我有机会参观了这座墨西哥人引为自豪的核电站。
    那是在绿湖一号反应堆的主厂房。近旁，微风送来墨西哥湾加勒比海的絮语；从如盖的华荫里传来鸫鸟的啭声。我们戴上安全帽，穿过安全检查门，小个子的路易斯工程师便开始介绍核电站的建设情况。搭乘电梯到达反应堆主厂房７层，又沿着窄窄的扶梯向上攀登了两层，居高临下，厂房内的情形便一目了然。核反应堆安置在圆形的深井里，井口直径４２米、井深共计７１米，其中１１米在地面以下。右侧井里是蒸汽辅机，左侧是燃料井。一架黄色的吊车来回移动，把装在长长铝管中的浓缩铀逐个从燃料井中提出，装入反应堆。路易斯告诉我们，总共需要装填９０吨浓缩铀。投入运转后，每年将消耗１８吨铀。为了防止核泄漏，燃料井的上层是１０米深的水，水下２０米的井道里才安置核燃料。绿湖核电站是采用美国技术的沸水式核电站，以轻水冷却；反应堆产生的巨大蒸汽动力推动涡轮发电机的运转，发出电能。整个绿湖核电站除了已建成的一号反应堆外，二号反应堆机组正在建设。每一组的装机容量都是６５．４万千瓦；两座反应堆的年发电量共达４０亿度。
    到目前为止，墨西哥发电能源主要是石油，还有部分水力与地热发电。预计到９０年代初，电力需求增大，而石油产量和储量将越来越有限，因此，墨西哥政府审时度势，对建设核电站进行了可行性研究后，于１９７６年动工兴建绿湖核电站。经过１０多年的努力，一号反应堆机组于１９８８年１０月竣工。这是为实现能源多样化而采取的战略性抉择。核电站发言人科索略工程师说：绿湖核电站与世界各国目前在建的核电站一样，采用了现代技术，拥有３道安全屏障，确保万无一失。他补充说，人们对核电站的恐惧是因为有部分人类遭受过原子弹袭击的惨痛经历。其实，原子弹的核裂变与反应堆的裂变是完全不同的。前者是不受控制的，后者则受到严格的控制。
    在谈论这个控制的问题中，我们进到３号控制楼。宽敞的控制室里，组合成马蹄形的控制台上，红色、绿色、黄色的指示灯调皮地眨着眼睛，电脑打印机上吐出长长的数据纸。这儿３座主控制台，分别控制着涡轮发电机、核反应堆与辅助系统。在主控制楼里还装备了备用电机，必需的食品、药物、厨房及卫生设备、甚至健身房。在发生飓风、水灾或其它自然灾害时，控制室工作人员可以在里面坚持工作２０天，确保反应堆的安全运转。
    为一号反应堆配套的还包括放射物监控系统、循环用水的处理工厂等。反应堆的水冷系统是独立、密封循环的。从反应堆里流出的冷却水经密封系统处理后仍然流入反应堆进行下一次冷却。因此，核电站将不会对周围生态产生有害影响。为了确保安全，墨西哥在建设绿湖核电站的同时就开始进行专业人员培训。每一个操作人员都要取得合格证书才能走上操作岗位。我们参观时，正有一群经过培训的技术人员在进行课题操作试验。
    我们对绿湖的访问是在工程技术人员的宿营地结束的。那一幢幢小房子依山傍湖而建，网球场、儿童游乐场上的欢笑声使这里看上去像是一个度假村，核电站的工作人员与他们的妻子儿女一起住在这个离反应堆仅５公里的营地里，这本身就有助于打消人们对绿湖安全与否的疑虑。主人用湖里的鱼、海里的虾做成美味的菜肴款待我们。同行者中一位苏联朋友问道：２０年后这湖里的鱼、虾还能吃吗？主人笑着说：“请你２０年后再来尝鲜。”我抬头放眼望去。蓝天下，湖面上粼粼碧波；湖那边舒展的草原上，牛儿在安详地徜徉；营地里，又传来孩子们的欢笑。在这绿色的土地上正孕育着墨西哥人对建设未来的希望。
