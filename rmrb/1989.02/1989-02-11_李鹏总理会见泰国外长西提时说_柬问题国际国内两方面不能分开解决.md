Premier Li Peng Meets with Thai Foreign Minister Siddhi Savetsila

	Premier Li Peng said that the Cambodian issue cannot be solved separately on the international and domestic fronts

	Beijing, February 10 (Reported by Wen Xian) — Premier Li Peng met with Thai Foreign Minister Siddhi Savetsila and his delegation this afternoon in the Zhongnanhai Purple Light Pavilion. “We haven’t seen each other for three months, right? Now, there are no problems in Sino-Thai bilateral relations. We often exchange views on the Cambodian issue because everyone is concerned about it,” Li Peng said with a smile to Siddhi.

	Li Peng pointed out that both sides believe that Prince Sihanouk should play his due role in the political settlement of the Cambodian issue. Under the leadership of Prince Sihanouk, the establishment of a temporary quadripartite coalition government is very necessary to prevent civil war in Cambodia after the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops. The international and domestic aspects of the Cambodian issue cannot be separated. Vietnam not only needs to genuinely withdraw its troops from Cambodia but also must take responsibility for the resolution of domestic issues in Cambodia. Vietnam’s attempt to continue controlling Cambodia through the Heng Samrin regime is absolutely unacceptable.

	Foreign Minister Siddhi agreed completely with Premier Li Peng’s analysis and views on the Cambodian issue. He believed that the situation of civil war in Cambodia after the victory of the Cambodian people poses a threat to Thailand’s security. Thailand hopes to see an independent, neutral, and non-aligned Cambodia. He reiterated that Thailand’s policy towards Cambodia, which has been maintained for 10 years, will not change now.

	Both sides emphasized that China, Thailand, and ASEAN countries have had good cooperation on the Cambodian issue in the past and will continue to have better cooperation in the future.

	Premier Li Peng asked Foreign Minister Siddhi to convey his greetings to Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan and welcomed Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan’s upcoming visit to China.

	Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and Thai Ambassador to China Dej Bunna were present at the meeting.

　　李鹏总理会见泰国外长西提时说    
    柬问题国际国内两方面不能分开解决
    本报北京２月１０日讯  记者温宪报道：国务院总理李鹏今天下午在中南海紫光阁会见了泰国外长西提·沙卫西拉一行。“我们有三个月没见面了吧。现在中泰双边关系不存在问题。我们双方就柬埔寨问题经常交换意见，因为大家都关心柬埔寨问题”。宾主一落座，李鹏总理就笑着对西提外长说。
    李鹏指出，我们双方都认为西哈努克亲王在政治解决柬埔寨问题上应该发挥他应有的作用。在西哈努克亲王的主持下建立一个四方临时联合政府，这对于越南撤军以后，防止在柬埔寨出现内战是非常必要的。柬埔寨问题的国际和国内两个方面不能分开解决。越南不仅要从柬埔寨真正撤军，而且它也必须对柬埔寨国内问题的解决承担责任。越南企图通过韩桑林政权继续控制柬埔寨是绝对不能接受的。
    西提外长表示完全同意李鹏总理对柬埔寨问题的分析和看法。他认为，柬埔寨人民胜利以后在柬埔寨出现内战的局面对泰国的安全是个威胁。泰国希望出现一个独立、中立和不结盟的柬埔寨。他重申泰国坚持了１０年的对柬埔寨的政策现在也决不会改变。
    双方强调，中国、泰国以及东盟国家在柬埔寨问题上过去有着很好的合作，今后，也还会有更好的合作。
    李鹏总理请西提外长转达他对差猜·春哈旺总理的问候，并欢迎差猜·春哈旺总理近期访问中国。
    中国外长钱其琛和泰国驻华大使德·汶纳等会见时在座。
