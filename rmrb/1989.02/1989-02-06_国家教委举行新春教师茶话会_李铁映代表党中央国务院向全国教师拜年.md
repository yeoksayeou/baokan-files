The State Education Commission held a spring teacher tea party today. Li Tieying, on behalf of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, extended New Year greetings to the teachers present and to all teachers across the country, and also conveyed greetings to the families of the teachers.

Before the tea party, Hu Qili, Li Tieying, Rui Xingwen, Hu Qiaomu, Yan Jici, Lei Jieqiong, Chen Xitong, Kang Keqing, and Zhou Peiyuan, along with 20 teacher representatives, had a group photo taken.

Li Tieying said in his speech that in 1989, the central government has decided to ensure educational investment during the period of economic adjustment. Despite the tight fiscal and financial situation, the budget for education will not only not be reduced but will also see a significant increase. At the same time, we must persist in developing various school-running systems and actively establish new channels for raising educational funds.

He extended New Year greetings to the teachers, saying: The hope for the revitalization of the nation lies in education, and the hope for the development of education lies in teachers. The achievements of China's education in the past are the result of the hard work of all teachers. To achieve the goals of educational development and reform in the future, we must rely on the united efforts and pioneering spirit of all teachers.

During the tea party, ten teachers, including Ren Xiaai from Beijing No. 119 Middle School, shared their experiences and insights on educational reform and offered valuable suggestions for current educational reforms.

　　国家教委举行新春教师茶话会
  　李铁映代表党中央国务院向全国教师拜年
    本报北京２月５日讯  记者魏玉凤报道：今天上午国家教委在人民大会堂安徽厅举行新春教师茶话会。国务委员、国家教委主任李铁映代表党中央和国务院给在座的教师及全国的教师拜年，向广大的教师家属问好。
    茶话会前，胡启立、李铁映、芮杏文、胡乔木、严济慈、雷洁琼、陈希同、康克清、周培源等同参加座谈会的２０名教师代表合影留念。
    李铁映在讲话中说，１９８９年，中央已经决定，在经济调整时期要确保教育的投入。在紧缩财政、金融的形势下，对教育的财政拨款不仅不压，而且有较大的增加。同时，我们要坚持发展多种办学体制，积极建立筹措教育经费的新渠道。
    他向教师们表示节日祝贺说：振兴民族的希望在教育，振兴教育的希望在教师。我国教育事业过去取得的成就凝聚着广大教师的辛勤劳动，要实现今后教育发展和改革的目标，也必须全力依靠广大教师团结奋斗、开拓前进。
    在茶话会上，北京一一九中学的任小艾等十位老师畅谈了教育改革的经验与体会，对当前教改提出了有益的建议。
