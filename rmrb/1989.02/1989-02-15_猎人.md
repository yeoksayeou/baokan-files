The Hunter
Jie Lixing

From the blue-flowered gourd of corn wine from the Phnom Penh sea
From the laughter-stained red faces by the fire pit
Wait for the fire and alcohol to warm the green vines of the wooden house
Wait for the tiger claw on the forehead to be painted in crimson
The legend comes with the pine wind passing through the valley
Accompanied by high and low howls
Stewed in the copper-mouthed pipe, flickering on and off
He takes down a hunting rifle from the fire pit and caresses it
With a burst of fire, he dispels the villagers' fear
No matter how ferocious the beast, it cannot escape the hunter's gun
No matter how fierce the hunter, he cannot escape the woman's heart
The tiger skin he sits on, the leopard tail at the end of his vision
The wild boar tusks on the wall all come back to life
And when the fire pit dims and the hunter retreats into his snores
Lead bullets fall to the ground, blooming into small flowers
In his dreams, he picks a bunch of golden flowers and inserts them into the gun barrel
Following the path of his own footsteps, trampling the plantain leaf trail
Toward the misty mountains, stretching out the legend of General Fu Bo's conquest of Xiangxi

　　猎人
    解黎晴
    从金边蓝花大海碗的苞谷酒里游来
  　从哗笑渍红脸膛的火塘边窜出来
    待火苗和酒精烤热木屋的青藤
    待额头上虎爪的写意画涂成绛紫
    传奇才和穿过谷口的松风一起
    伴着高一声低一声的呼嗥声
    焖熟在铜嘴烟锅里一灭一明
    他从火塘上取下一杆猎枪抚弄着
    用一团火射杀了山民的恐惧
    再凶猛的野兽也逃不出猎人的枪口
    再烈性的猎人也走不出女人的心
    他垫坐的虎皮他视线尽头的豹尾
    墙上那排野猪的獠牙一齐恢复了生命
    而当火塘黯淡猎人躲进自己的鼾声
    一粒粒铅弹吹落地上开出一朵朵小花
    睡梦中采一束金黄的花朵插进枪筒
    沿着他自己的脚步踩出的车前子草径
    朝着云雾山横亘伏波将军征湘西的传说延伸
