	The memorial service was held at the Lhasa Theater. The venue was solemnly arranged according to Tibetan and religious customs. The portrait of Panchen Erdeni was hung in the center of the stage. Above and behind the portrait were yellow canopies and yellow curtains, symbolizing his exalted status in Tibetan Buddhism. Below the portrait were wreaths from his parents and relatives. In front of the portrait, according to religious customs, offerings of fruits, pure water, incense, butter lamps, and Tibetan barberis flowers were placed. Evergreen trees and wintergreen were arranged on both sides and in front of the offerings.

	Wreaths from Yang Shangkun, Wan Li, Li Xiannian, Tian Jiyun, Yan Mingfu, Xi Zhongxun, Apho Aqing Jinmei, Baba La Ge Liangjie, Zhao Puxiu, and leaders from the Party, government, and military of the Tibet Autonomous Region, as well as from the Central Committee of the Communist Party, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the State Council, the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee, the State Ethnic Affairs Commission, the State Administration for Religious Affairs, the Buddhist Association of China, and the Party and government departments of the Tibet Autonomous Region, Qinghai, Gansu, Sichuan, Yunnan, Chengdu Military Region, and Tibet Military Region were placed around the venue.

	The memorial service was presided over by Baba La Ge Liangjie, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Honorary President of the Tibet Branch of the Buddhist Association of China, and Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the People's Congress of the Tibet Autonomous Region. Hu Jintao, Secretary of the Tibet Autonomous Region Party Committee, delivered a eulogy at the meeting.

	In his eulogy, Hu Jintao reviewed Panchen Erdeni's lifelong dedication to his country and religion, his contributions to national unity and socialist construction, and his illustrious achievements. Hu Jintao said that Panchen Erdeni was a great patriot deeply loved by all ethnic groups in the country. Throughout his life, he stood firm on the principles of patriotism, unity, and progress, resolutely opposed separatism and regression, and sincerely safeguarded national unity and ethnic unity. From the "fake people's congress" incident in the early days of Tibet's liberation to the disturbances and riots caused by a few separatist elements in Lhasa in September 1987, in every anti-separatist struggle, Panchen Erdeni stood firm, held high the banner of patriotism, and resolutely safeguarded national unity and ethnic unity. In 1980, Deng Xiaoping praised Panchen Erdeni as "one of the best patriots in our country" during a conversation with him.

	Hu Jintao said that Panchen Erdeni was a loyal friend of the Communist Party of China. He always supported the leadership of the Communist Party of China, worked closely with the Communist Party of China, shared weal and woe, and cooperated with it. He taught people from all walks of life and the broad masses to follow the Party's words and follow the Party, and to willingly accept the leadership of the Communist Party of China. To maintain the prestige and image of the Party, he often gave suggestions and advice to the Party Central Committee on the work of Tibet and other Tibetan areas, speaking frankly and without reservation, with high moral character and exemplary conduct, serving as a model for all ethnic groups in the region.

	Hu Jintao said that Panchen Erdeni was a famous statesman and our respected national leader. Panchen Erdeni was an outstanding representative of the Tibetan people. He cared deeply about the work in Tibet, the growth and progress of cadres from all ethnic groups, the happiness of the Tibetan people, and the development and progress of Tibetan society. For the prosperity and wealth of Tibet and the development and progress of the Tibetan nationality, he devoted his heart and soul, making tremendous contributions. The Tibetan people will forever remember this.

	Hu Jintao said that Panchen Erdeni was an outstanding leader of Tibetan Buddhism in China. As the natural successor of the Panchen Erdeni of previous incarnations, he educated the broad masses of monks to love their country and religion, and to diligently study Buddhist scriptures and inherit Tibetan Buddhism. He followed the teachings of Buddhism: to abandon evil and accumulate virtue, to practice self-control and benefit others, to purify the country and accumulate merit. He was deeply versed in Buddhism and made unremitting efforts to promote and enrich Tibetan Buddhism, earning the sincere respect and faith of the broad masses of believers.

	Hu Jintao said that the passing of Vice Chairman Panchen Erdeni Lobsang Choekyi Gyaltsen is a great loss to our country and a great loss to all ethnic groups in the country, including the Tibetan people. We, the people of all ethnic groups in the region, should turn our grief into strength, learn from and carry forward the merits and spirit of Vice Chairman Panchen, inherit his will, and strive to build a united, prosperous, and civilized socialist new Tibet, promoting the common prosperity of all ethnic groups.

	Leaders from the Tibet Autonomous Region Party Committee, the Tibet Autonomous Region Advisory Committee, the Tibet Autonomous Region Discipline Inspection Commission, the Tibet Autonomous Region People's Congress Standing Committee, the Tibet Autonomous Region People's Government, the Tibet Autonomous Region People's Political Consultative Conference, and the Tibet Military Region, as well as leaders from the Party, government, and military organs of Lhasa City, and leaders from various departments, people's organizations, and religious organizations of the Tibet Autonomous Region and Lhasa City, slowly walked to the portrait of Panchen Erdeni in the solemn music, bowing to pay their respects. Many people offered khatas to the portrait.

	Baba La Ge Liangjie and other leaders expressed their deep condolences to Panchen Erdeni's father, Yao Xi Gu Gongdain, his mother, Yao Xi Suolang Qima, and his younger brother, who came to the memorial service despite their illness.

	Outside the venue, many people also gathered to pay their respects.

    追悼会场设在拉萨剧院。按照民族、宗教仪轨布置的会场庄严肃穆，班禅大师的遗像悬挂在主席台中央，遗像上方和背后是黄色华盖和黄色天幕，象征他在藏传佛教中的崇高地位。遗像下面安放着他的父母等亲属献的花圈。遗像前按宗教仪轨摆放着供果、净水、藏香、酥油灯、藏巴卡花。供品两旁和前方摆放着冬青树和天冬草。
    杨尚昆、万里、李先念、田纪云、阎明复、习仲勋、阿沛·阿旺晋美、帕巴拉·格列朗杰、赵朴初以及西藏自治区党政军领导同志和中共中央、全国人大常委会、国务院、全国政协、中共中央统战部、国家民委、国务院宗教局、中国佛协以及西藏自治区、青海、甘肃、四川、云南党政部门、成都军区、西藏军区等送的花圈，摆放在会场周围。
    追悼会由全国政协副主席、中国佛协西藏分会名誉会长、自治区人大常委会副主任帕巴拉·格列朗杰主持。中共西藏自治区委员会书记胡锦涛在会上致悼词。
    胡锦涛在悼词中回顾了班禅大师一生爱国爱教，为祖国统一、民族团结，为祖国社会主义建设，做出的光辉业绩。胡锦涛说，班禅大师是深受全国各族人民爱戴的伟大的爱国主义者。他毕生坚持爱国、团结、进步的立场，坚决反对分裂、倒退，竭诚维护祖国统一和民族团结。从西藏解放初期发生的“伪人民会议”事件，到１９８７年９月以来少数分裂主义分子在拉萨制造的骚乱、闹事，在历次反分裂斗争中，班禅大师都立场坚定，高举爱国旗帜，坚决维护祖国统一，维护民族团结。邓小平同志１９８０年与班禅大师谈话时称大师“是我们国家一个最好的爱国者”。
    胡锦涛说，班禅大师是中国共产党的忠诚朋友。他始终如一地拥护中国共产党的领导，长期与中国共产党同舟共济、肝胆相照、荣辱与共、合作共事。他教诲各界爱国人士和广大人民群众听党的话、跟党走，自觉接受中国共产党的领导。为了维护党的威望和形象，他经常向党中央就西藏和其他藏区工作提出意见、建议，知无不言，言无不尽，高风亮节，堪为人表，是全区各族人民的楷模。
    胡锦涛说，班禅大师是我国著名的国务活动家，我们尊敬的国家领导人。班禅大师是藏族人民的优秀代表。他十分关心西藏工作，十分关心各族干部的成长和进步，十分关心藏族人民的幸福，十分关心西藏社会的发展进步，为了西藏的繁荣富裕和藏民族的发展进步，他呕心沥血，做出了巨大的贡献，西藏人民将永远铭记在心。
    胡锦涛说，班禅大师是中国藏传佛教的杰出领袖。作为历世班禅大师的当然继承人，他教育广大僧众爱国爱教，精心钻研佛经，继承藏传佛教；他遵照佛教教义：弃恶积善、自制利他、严庄国土、广积功德；他佛学精深、造诣高广，为藏传佛教的弘扬和光大做出了不懈的努力，受到了广大信教群众的真诚崇敬和信仰。
    胡锦涛说，班禅额尔德尼·确吉坚赞副委员长的逝世是我们国家的一个重大损失，是包括藏族人民在内的全国各民族人民的一个重大损失。我们全区各族人民各界人士要化悲痛为力量，学习和发扬班禅副委员长的功德和精神，继承他的遗志，为建设团结、富裕、文明的社会主义新西藏，促进各族的共同繁荣而奋斗。
    参加追悼大会的中共西藏自治区委员会、西藏自治区顾问委员会、自治区纪律检查委员会、西藏自治区人大常委会、西藏自治区人民政府、西藏自治区政协、人民解放军西藏军区负责人和拉萨市党政军领导机关负责人，西藏自治区和拉萨市各部门、人民团体、宗教组织负责人等在低回的哀乐声中缓缓走到班禅大师遗像前鞠躬致敬，许多人向大师遗像献了哈达。
