About 1,000 Cypriot football fans rioted after the Scottish football team defeated the Cyprus team 3-2, resulting in minor injuries to the referee and serious injuries to eight police officers. The field was littered with stones, cans, and even firecrackers. The police have arrested four of the rioting fans.

According to foreign media reports, on February 8th, the Scottish football team played a match in Limassol, a port city in southern Cyprus. This was a qualifying match for the 1990 World Cup in Europe. Approximately 25,000 spectators attended the game, including more than 1,200 Scottish fans who had traveled specifically for the match. With just 10 seconds left in the game, Richard Gough of the Scottish team scored a header, securing a 3-2 victory for Scotland and significantly increasing their chances of advancing in the group.

After the game, Cypriot fans rushed onto the field, starting a riot that lasted about two minutes. The East German referee, S. Kieferschein, was punched by a released mental patient as he left the field. The fans then surrounded the Scottish team's dressing room. The Scottish team quickly closed the metal door, allowing the players to escape unharmed. However, the door was pelted with stones, cans, and bottles. The police arrived and dispersed the attacking fans. Under their protection, the Scottish team safely reached the airport.

　　塞浦路斯足球队主场失利    
    当地球迷迁怒于对手裁判
    新华社北京２月９日电  大约１０００名塞浦路斯球迷在苏格兰足球队以３∶２战胜塞浦路斯队后，大闹球场，致使裁判轻微受伤，８名警察遭重创，场地里石块、罐头，甚至炮仗横飞。警方现已逮捕了４名闹事球迷。
    据外电报道，８日，苏格兰足球队在塞浦路斯南部海港城市利马索尔客场作战。这是１９９０年世界杯足球赛预赛欧洲区的一场比赛。大约２５０００名观众到场助战，其中有１２００多名专程赶来的苏格兰球迷。在离终场还剩下１０秒钟时，苏格兰队的理查德·高夫一记头球破门，使苏格兰队以３∶２获胜，并使苏格兰小组出线的希望大大增加。
    比赛结束后，塞浦路斯球迷随即冲下看台，开始了大约２分钟的骚乱，民主德国裁判西·基弗申随队退场时，遭到一名保释出院的精神病人的拳击。接着，球迷们又围攻苏格兰足球队的更衣室。苏格兰队及时关闭了金属大门，球员得以幸免于难。但大门上则吃了不少石头、罐头盒和酒瓶子。警方赶到后，驱散了围攻的球迷。在他们的护送下，苏格兰队安然抵达机场。
