Today, Wu Shaozu, the director of the State Sports Commission, addressed over 1,000 officials from the commission and its affiliated units, quoting the famous table tennis player Rong Guotuan's words, "Life is like a game of table tennis; you only have a few chances to win." He encouraged sports officials to rally their spirits and take action to prepare for the 11th Asian Games and to complete the tasks for 1989.

The State Sports Commission held a staff meeting today, during which Wu Shaozu delivered a mobilization speech on the current work. He said that the commission's work this year mainly focuses on six aspects: ① deepening sports reform; ② preparing for the Asian Games; ③ finding new ways to promote mass sports; ④ completing major domestic and international competition tasks; ⑤ holding important meetings such as the National Sports Commission Directors' Conference and the National Sports Federation Representatives' Conference; ⑥ striving to achieve a breakthrough in sports exchanges across the Taiwan Strait. Among these six tasks, the key points are sports reform and preparing for the Asian Games.

When discussing the Beijing Asian Games, Wu Shaozu said, "Although the time is tight and the tasks are heavy, we must see that holding such a large-scale Asian sports event will greatly boost the morale of the Chinese people and expand our international influence. It is also a rehearsal for our country's sports march towards Barcelona." Central leaders such as Zhao Ziyang and Li Peng have repeatedly emphasized the importance of successfully hosting the Asian Games. Wu Shaozu used an analogy, saying that we should be like a pawn crossing a river—we can only move forward, not backward. He also mentioned seven key tasks for preparing for the Asian Games and gave specific instructions to the relevant departments, including the training and management of the participating teams, the organization and scheduling of the 27 competitions, the preparation of venues and equipment, and news publicity work, among others.

Regarding China's sports reform, Wu Shaozu believes that it is necessary to reform, but it should not be done haphazardly. He hopes that more attention will be paid to the theoretical research of sports reform. He proposed that in terms of macro-control, sports reform should be more stringent, while in terms of micro-management, it should be more flexible. The specific steps should be taken steadily.

　　伍绍祖谈国家体委今年工作安排
　　确定亚运会准备工作为首要任务
    本报北京２月３日讯  记者刘小明报道：“人生能有几回搏！”今天，国家体委主任伍绍祖面对１０００多名体委机关和直属单位干部，重提乒坛名将容国团的名言，激励体育界的同志振奋精神，紧张行动起来，迎接第１１届亚运会，做好１９８９年的准备工作。
    国家体委今天召开干部大会，伍绍祖就当前工作进行动员报告。他说，今年国家体委的工作主要有６个方面：①深化体育改革；②准备亚运会；③在开展群众体育上摸出一条新路子；④完成好国内外重大比赛任务；⑤开好全国体委主任会议、全国体总代表大会等几个重要会议；⑥争取海峡两岸的体育交流取得突破。这６项工作中重点是体育改革和迎接亚运会。
    在谈到北京亚运会时，伍绍祖说，虽然时间紧迫，任务繁重，但我们要看到，开好这样一次大规模的亚洲体育盛会对振奋全国人民的精神，扩大我们的国际影响有着重要意义，同时也是我国体育进军巴塞罗那的演习。赵紫阳、李鹏等中央领导同志几次讲过，要把亚运会办好。伍绍祖打了一个比喻说，我们要像过河卒子那样，只能前进不许后退。他还提到迎接亚运会要做好的七件事，并向业务部门做出具体布置，包括参赛队伍的训练和管理，２７项竞赛的组织编排和场地器材准备，还有新闻宣传工作等。
    对于我国体育改革，伍绍祖认为，不改不行，乱改不行。他希望要重视体育改革的理论研究。他提出，体育改革在宏观上要掌握紧一些，微观上要放活，具体步骤上要稳扎稳打。
