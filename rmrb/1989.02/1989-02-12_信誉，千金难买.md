Reputation is the lifeblood of an enterprise. Good reputation brings prosperity to the business.

Enterprises with good reputations can correctly handle the relationship between their economic benefits and social benefits, prioritizing social benefits first and enterprise benefits second. Naturally, they gain the trust of society.

Currently, there are many instances where enterprises solely pursue their own economic benefits without considering social benefits. Reports indicate that before the Spring Festival, a quality inspection of 1,700-plus products in ten major cities found a mere 57% qualification rate. This means nearly half of the products have harmed the interests of consumers and users. Practices such as passing off inferior goods as superior or providing less than what is promised may yield short-term gains, but ultimately, they will tarnish the enterprise's reputation.

The value of China Global Leasing Company lies in its enterprise mission, which prioritizes social benefits. As long as it benefits the renovation of old enterprises and foreign exchange earnings, they will engage in low-profit or even no-profit ventures. Thus, their reputation continues to grow.

Can an enterprise achieve both economic and social benefits? Thin profits compared to thick profits will indeed result in some losses for the enterprise, but thin profits with high sales volume can accumulate to yield greater profits. In this way, the enterprise's economic and social benefits form a virtuous cycle, ensuring the enterprise's development. Therefore, one must not lose sight of the bigger picture for minor gains.

### 信誉，千金难买

　　信誉，千金难买
    杨泓
    信誉是企业的生命。信誉好则事业旺。
    信誉好的企业，能够正确处理本企业的经济效益和社会效益的关系，把社会效益放在第一位，企业利益放在第二位。自然，也就得到社会的信任。
    眼下，一味追求本企业的经济效益而不讲社会效益者，屡见不鲜。报载，春节前十大城市市场商品质量抽查，在１７００多种商品中，合格率只有５７％。这就是说，有近一半的商品使消费者和用户的利益受到损害。以次充好、以少充多等不良做法，固能得利一时，但终究会坏了自家招牌。
    中国环球租赁公司的可贵之处，在于企业宗旨体现了社会效益第一，只要对老企业改造和创汇有利，微利、让利都干；对特殊项目，无利保本也干。这样，他们的信誉与日俱增。
    企业的经济效益和社会效益能否两全？薄利比之厚利，当然企业会有所失，但是薄利多销，聚沙成塔，还是能赢得多利的。如是，企业的经济效益和社会效益形成良性循环，企业何愁不得发展！所以，千万不要因小失大。
