Currently, the 12 member countries of the European Community produce 110 million tons of urban waste annually. Each member country handles waste differently: Greece has only small incinerators, while Ireland and Portugal do not use incineration. West Germany and the Netherlands incinerate 30% of their urban waste, while France incinerates nearly 40%. Overall, about 3/4 of the waste in the European Community is landfilled, and 1/4 is incinerated.

The European Community's waste management is moving in two directions: first, recovering resources from waste. Some waste incinerators in the Netherlands and Italy recover heat for heating, and the waste processing plant in Liège, Belgium, uses plastic waste to produce cable reels. In Denmark, locally produced glass bottles are all recycled. Many countries use waste to make recycled paper.

Second, reducing waste as much as possible. Ireland has banned the production of pull-tab cans. Given the significant harm caused by plastic waste, the European Community encourages the reduction or elimination of plastic use, promoting the use of glass products for easier recycling. Italy and the UK plan to start using biodegradable plastics in the 1990s, and the Federal Republic of Germany has already produced plastic packaging that can be reused up to 30 times.

Since the early 1970s, the European Community has been paying attention to waste management. It issues directives or recommendations to member countries every one or two years, urging them to take effective measures as soon as possible. The European Parliament annually calls for public awareness and provides suggestions. However, the urban waste problem in the European Community is far from being completely solved. Current methods of landfilling and incineration are both unsatisfactory, especially landfilling, which seems to be creating future problems and urgently needs improvement. The Walloon region of Belgium is known as the "European Dump," and due to neighboring countries frequently dumping waste and the lack of necessary management systems, the air has been severely polluted, and groundwater sources have been affected. According to statistics from the European Community Commission, the 520 incinerators in the 12 member countries emit 28,000 tons of dust, 570 tons of lead, 144 tons of hydrochloric acid, 68 tons of mercury, and 31 tons of cadmium annually, severely polluting the ecological environment.

During a conversation with a reporter, European Parliament member Roland believed that waste management is not something that can be achieved overnight; it requires persistent effort. From the interaction, the reporter was deeply impressed. This parliament member's business cards and personal stationery are all made of recycled paper, which, though not very clean, show a strong commitment to environmental protection that is touching. He advocates for global cooperation, regardless of national boundaries, to solve this problem that may harm future generations. He strongly opposes the practice of shifting hidden dangers to others. Technology is advancing, and the Earth is becoming smaller. People today should be concerned with the worries of future generations and have the responsibility to leave a clean and beautiful world for the next generation.

　　应怀千岁忧
    本报记者  魏崴
    　　　　西欧
    目前，欧洲共同体１２个成员国每年产生的城市垃圾达１．１亿吨。各成员国处理垃圾的做法也不一样：希腊仅拥有小型焚化厂，爱尔兰和葡萄牙则不采用焚烧法。西德和荷兰的城市垃圾３０％用焚烧法，法国的这一比率近４０％。就整个欧共体而言，约３／４填埋，１／４焚化。
    欧共体的垃圾处理似循着两个方向：首先是从垃圾中回收资源。荷兰和意大利等国的一些垃圾焚化厂回收热能作取暖能源，比利时列日的垃圾处理厂用塑料废品生产电缆轴，丹麦市场上出售的本国制玻璃瓶，一律回收再用。不少国家已用垃圾造再生纸。
    其次，尽量减少弃置物。爱尔兰已禁止生产易拉罐。鉴于塑料废品危害大，欧共体鼓励不用或少用塑料，代之以玻璃制品，以利循环使用。意大利和英国决定从９０年代开始用生物分解性塑料，联邦德国已生产出可反复使用３０次的塑料包装。
    从７０年代初，欧共体就开始重视垃圾处理了。它每隔一两年，就要向成员国发出指令或建议，要成员国尽早采取有效措施。欧洲议会年年都大声疾呼，向公众陈明利害，提出建议。但是，欧共体的城市垃圾问题还远未彻底解决。目前通行的填埋法和焚烧法都不尽人意，尤其是填埋法，似养虎遗患，亟待改进。比利时瓦隆地区有“欧洲垃圾场”之称，由于邻国经常偷倒垃圾和该地缺乏必要的管理体系，结果，空气被严重污染，且已影响到地下水源。据欧共体委员会统计，１２个成员国的５２０座焚化厂每年排放尘埃２８０００吨，铅５７０吨，氯化氢１４４吨，汞６８吨，镉３１吨，严重地污染了生态环境。
    欧洲议会议员罗兰在同记者谈话时认为，垃圾处理决非是一蹴而就的事情，必须锲而不舍。在和他接触中，记者留下强烈的印象。这位议员的名片和私人信笺用的都是再生纸，虽不甚光洁，但那种倡导保护环境的用心，叫人感动。他主张不分国度，大家携起手来一道解决这个可能遗患后人的全球问题。他对转嫁隐祸于他人的做法深恶痛绝。科技在进步，地球在变小。当代人应怀千岁忧，有责任给后代留下一个清洁、美丽的世界。
