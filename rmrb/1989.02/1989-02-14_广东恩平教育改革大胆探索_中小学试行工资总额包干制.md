    Guangdong Enping Boldly Explores Education Reform
    Primary and Secondary Schools Implement Total Wage Package System

    XINHUA NEWS AGENCY — Based on the consolidation and improvement of the principal and teacher appointment system, primary and secondary schools in Enping County, Guangdong, will gradually implement the total wage package system starting from the new semester this year.

    The content of this package system is as follows: The county's financial bureau, based on the provincial standard, will determine the total number of positions for each primary and secondary school. The total wage amount will be allocated to the county's education bureau, which will remain fixed for the year and be disbursed monthly. The county education bureau, based on the enrollment plan for the year, will determine the total number of positions for teachers and staff in each primary and secondary school according to the standard number of positions. The total wage amount will be allocated to the education offices of each town and each middle school, and each town will then directly allocate it to the primary schools. Once the total wage amount is allocated to the schools, the schools will implement a fixed number of positions but not a fixed number of people. That is, based on the total number of positions determined by the county, and under the premise of ensuring the normal operation of the school, the school will determine the number of personnel and the number of teachers and staff needed according to the principles of optimizing the teacher combination and improving the quality of education. The number of full-time teachers can be reduced by up to 10% of the total number of positions.

    After implementing the total wage package system in Enping County's primary and secondary schools, the redundant personnel will be handled by each town in conjunction with the county education bureau, and reported to the county education commission for approval and proper arrangement: first, within the school system; second, within the education system through the education administrative department to another school; third, in coordination with relevant departments, transferred out of the education system and reassigned to another job.

　　广东恩平教育改革大胆探索    
    中小学试行工资总额包干制
    本报讯  广东恩平县的中小学在巩固和完善校长、教师聘任制基础上，从今年新学期开始，逐步推行工资总额包干制。
    这种包干制的内容是：县财政局根据省编标准，核定各中小学的总编制，把工资总额包给县教育局，一年一定，按月拨给。县教育局根据当年的招生计划，按定编标准核定各中小学教职工的总编制，把工资总额包给各镇教育办公室和各中学，各镇再直接包干到小学。工资总额包干到学校后，学校实行定编不定员。即根据县核定总编制数，在保证学校工作正常运转前提下，从优化教师组合、有利提高教育质量的原则出发，确定本校人员的设置及需要的教职工数量，可以超编，也可以减员，工资总额不变。专任教师的减员数要控制在总编制人数的１０％以内。
    恩平县中小学实行工资总额包干制后，裁出人员由各镇会同县教育局研究，并报县教育委员会审批，妥善安排：一是学校内部消化，当编外人员使用；二是在教育系统内调配，即通过教育行政部门调到别校；三是同有关部门协商，调离教育系统，另行分配工作。
