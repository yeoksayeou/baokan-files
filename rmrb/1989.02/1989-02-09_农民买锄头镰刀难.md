Currently, the entire country is focusing on agriculture, but the issue of farmers struggling to buy iron-made small agricultural tools has not yet received sufficient attention.

It is understood that due to a shortage of raw materials for producing hoes, sickles, plowshares, and other small agricultural tools, as well as the low profit margins, many county agricultural machinery factories that previously served agriculture have switched to other productions. In the Hancheng region of Shaanxi, the production of iron-made small agricultural tools by township enterprises last year totaled 1.54 million units, a decrease of 19.2% compared to the previous year. In Shaanxi Province, the production of small agricultural tools in some counties and cities has decreased, and the number of manufacturing factories has also been reducing year by year. In Nanzheng County, the Dajiahekan Agricultural Machinery Factory has shifted to producing aluminum alloy display racks, with the output value from agricultural tool manufacturing and maintenance accounting for only 4% of the annual total output value. In Yangxian County, the Dongjie Agricultural Machinery Factory produced 5,000 plowshares last year, a decrease of 44.5% compared to the previous year. Due to scarcity, what used to cost four or five yuan for a hoe now costs eight or nine yuan and is still hard to find. State-run tool stores rarely stock small agricultural tools, and the prices in free markets are high with limited varieties. The aforementioned problems, aside from the price increases of iron, steel, coal, and other materials, are mainly due to the lack of support from the relevant departments for agricultural machinery factories producing small agricultural tools. It is suggested that the relevant departments pay attention to agriculture starting from hoes and sickles, regularly inquire about and inspect the production and operation of iron-made small agricultural tools, and help solve the problems. Otherwise, this year's spring plowing and summer agricultural production may be affected.

### 农民买锄头镰刀难

　　农民买锄头镰刀难
    目前，全国上下抓农业，但农民买铁制小农具难的问题还未引起重视。
    据了解，由于生产锄头、镰刀、犁铧等小农具原材料缺，本大利微，一些过去为农业服务的县农机厂都纷纷转产改行了。陕西汉中地区乡镇企业去年生产的铁制小农具共１５４万件，比前年减少１９．２％。陕西省中有个县市的小农具产量下降，生产厂家也逐年减少。南郑县大河坎农机厂转产铝合金柜台货架，从事农具制造和维修的产值仅占年总产值的４％。洋县东街农机厂去年生产犁铧５０００片，比前年减少４４．５％，物以稀为贵，过去花四五元就可买一把锄头，现在八九元还难买到。小农具国营商店很少经销，自由市场价格很贵，品种单一。上述问题，除铁、钢、煤等涨价因素外，主要还是主管部门对农机厂生产小农具扶持不够。建议有关部门重视农业应从抓锄头镰刀入手，经常过问、检查铁制小农具生产经营情况，并帮助解决问题。否则，今年春耕和三夏生产将受到影响。
