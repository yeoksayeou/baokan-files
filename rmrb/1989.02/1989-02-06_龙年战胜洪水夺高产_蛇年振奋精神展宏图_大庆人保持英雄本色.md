The working class of Daqing Oilfield has, in the face of unprecedented difficulties, miraculously achieved an additional 30 million tons of crude oil production and drilled more than 200 new wells in the Year of the Dragon, and is now preparing for production in earnest to welcome the arrival of the Year of the Snake.

Last July, floods submerged more than a thousand oil wells. The oilfield faced an 8% electricity shortage, a significant gap in railway transport capacity, and a substantial increase in production material prices, with just steel, land use fees, and electricity costing the oilfield an additional 800 million yuan. Faced with the greatest challenges in the oilfield's 28-year history, the people of Daqing demonstrated their spirit of hard work and dedication. To quickly restore production of oil wells submerged in water, workers donated doors, furniture, and roof beams from their homes, swimming to deliver them to the wells, building rafts, scaffolding, and modifying oil extraction equipment. To raise funds for the production frontline, various departments voluntarily canceled the construction of 150,000 square meters of residential buildings, the municipal government halted the construction of office buildings, and the oilfield decided not to purchase cars for three years. To conserve oil, all offices started work an hour earlier in the afternoon. Each household used only one light bulb not exceeding 45 watts, and the oilfield used natural gas for power generation, while local small factories operated on a four-day work, three-day rest schedule to ensure electricity for oil production. To conserve oil, 253 large vehicles were equipped with natural gas tanks...

To utilize the remaining railway transport capacity during the holiday period to rush the loading and unloading of oilfield materials, nearly 5,000 staff and workers from the oilfield materials supply department will not take holidays this Spring Festival.

Before the holiday, the reporter traversed the new area of the oilfield. At temperatures below -30 degrees Celsius, the bitter cold wind pierced the skin, and snow covered the ground. However, the drilling rigs roared, shaking the earth, and the workers, like mud men and ice men, operated intensely on the drilling platforms, indifferent to the severe cold, inspiring respect and excitement.

　　龙年战胜洪水夺高产　蛇年振奋精神展宏图
　　大庆人保持英雄本色
    本报讯  记者武培真报道：大庆油田工人阶级在前所未有的困难面前，奇迹般地以超产３０万吨原油和超打２００多口新井为龙年写下了新的一页，又以扎扎实实的生产准备迎接蛇年春天的到来。
    去年７月，洪水吞没了上千口油井。全年缺电１／８，铁路运量缺口很大。又因生产资料涨价，仅钢材、土地占用费和电力三项便使油田增支８亿多元。面对油田２８年来的最大困难，大庆人发扬了艰苦奋斗和奉献精神，为使泡在水中的油井尽快恢复生产，职工们捐出家中的门板、家具料和盖房的檩条，泅水送到井上，编木筏、搭架子、改装采油设备。为给生产第一线筹集资金，各部门主动砍掉１５万平方米的住宅建设，市府停盖办公大楼，油田决定３年不买轿车。为节油，所有机关下午提前一小时上班。每家住户只点一盏不超过４５瓦的电灯，同时，油田用天然气发电，地方小厂停四（天）开三（天），给石油生产让电。为节油，２５３台大轿车背上了天然气包……如此等等，使油田全年生产原油５５７０万吨，超产３０万吨，打井近两千口，超打２００多口。
    为利用节日期间铁路剩余运力抢装抢卸油田物资，油田物资供应部门近５０００名干部工人今年春节不休假。
    节前，记者穿越油田新区，零下３０多度的低温，寒风刺骨，冰雪弥漫，然而钻机隆隆，震撼大地，工人们像泥人冰人一般紧张地操作在钻台上，置严寒于度外，令人钦敬感奋不已。
