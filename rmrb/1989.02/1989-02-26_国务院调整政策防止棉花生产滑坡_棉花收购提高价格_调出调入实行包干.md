The State Council has decided to adjust policies to prevent a slump in cotton production. The purchase price of cotton will be raised, and a quota system will be implemented for cotton distribution and procurement.

According to a report from Gao Baosheng at the national cotton production conference, the State Council has decided to raise the purchase price of cotton and implement a quota system for cotton distribution and procurement to boost the enthusiasm of local governments in promoting cotton production. At the beginning and end of the conference, State Councilor Chen Junsheng delivered speeches.

At the conference, which concluded on February 24, leaders from the State Council and relevant officials from 18 cotton-producing provinces and municipalities discussed the current situation of cotton production. They agreed that cotton production is a crucial pillar of the national economy and must be maintained and developed steadily. To prevent a slump in cotton production this year, it is urgent to take measures to adjust cotton policies, encouraging farmers to seize the opportunity to plant and manage cotton well, and increase cotton resources.

Chen Junsheng said that this adjustment of cotton purchase prices is mainly based on the price ratio with grains. For many years, the state has invested a lot of financial and material resources to develop cotton production. Now that the state is facing difficulties, it also needs the understanding and support of farmers. Rationalizing cotton prices is a massive systematic project with great difficulties that need to be gradually resolved.

To motivate local governments to focus on cotton production, the State Council has decided to implement a quota system for cotton distribution and procurement. This can gradually change the situation of "eating from the same big pot," benefiting both producing and consuming areas. Producing areas must guarantee the quota, with surplus cotton belonging to the province and deficit cotton not reducing the quota, only reducing local cotton use. Consuming areas must use cotton according to the plan and cannot demand more from producing areas or purchase independently. All consuming provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions must practice thrift. Areas with more textile exports should adhere to the "two ends outside" policy, importing part of the cotton through foreign trade departments.

Chen Junsheng emphasized that cotton is a planned commodity managed by the state. After adjusting the purchase price and implementing the quota system, the country must adhere to a single price and a single channel. The cotton market cannot be liberalized. Cotton prices cannot have dual tracks, and the supply and marketing cooperatives must manage them uniformly to prevent chaos such as multiple parties intervening, raising prices, hoarding, and reselling, which would disrupt the state plan.

　　国务院调整政策防止棉花生产滑坡
    棉花收购提高价格  调出调入实行包干
    本报讯  记者高保生从全国棉花生产座谈会上获悉：为了扭转我国棉花生产连年徘徊局面，鼓励广大棉农种好棉花，国务院决定提高棉花收购价格；同时，实行棉花调出、调入包干办法，以提高地方政府抓棉花的积极性。在会议开始和结束时，国务委员陈俊生讲了话。
    在２４日结束的座谈会上，国务院领导同志与来自１８个产棉省市的有关负责同志，一起讨论了当前棉花生产形势。大家认为，棉花生产是国民经济的重要支柱之一，必须保持稳定发展。为防止今年棉花生产滑坡，当务之急是进一步采取措施，调整棉花政策，鼓励农民不失时机地种足种好棉花，增加棉花资源。
    陈俊生说，这次调整棉花收购价格，主要是根据与粮食的比价关系确定的。多年来，国家为发展棉花生产付出了巨大财力、物力，现在国家有困难，也需要农民体谅和支持。理顺棉花价格，是一个巨大的系统工程，难度很大，需要逐步解决。
    为了调动地方政府抓棉花的积极性，国务院决定实行棉花调出、调入包干办法。这样，可以逐步改变“吃大锅饭”的状况，对产区、销区都有好处。产区必须保证调出，超产归省支配，减产不得少调，只能减少本省用棉。调入地方必须按计划用棉，不能找产区多要或自行采购。所有调入省区市，都要“省吃俭用”。出口纺织品较多的地方，应贯彻“两头在外”方针，通过外贸部门进口一部分棉花。
    陈俊生强调，棉花是国家管理的计划商品。收购价格调整和实行调拨包干后，全国必须坚持一个价格，一条渠道。棉花市场不能放开。棉花价格不能搞双轨，由供销社统一经营，以防出现多方插手，抬价抢购，转手倒卖等混乱现象发生，冲击国家计划。
