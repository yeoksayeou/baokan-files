The investigation results of the corruption case during the Fifth Republic (Chun Doo-hwan's administration) were announced by the South Korean police on the morning of January 31.

According to a report by the Seoul Broadcasting Station, among the 35 investigation items that were filed, the core issues regarding Chun Doo-hwan himself and "political funds" remain unresolved.

Regarding the illegal fundraising issue of the Ilhwa Group, as the think tank during Chun Doo-hwan's administration, he had requested various conglomerates to donate funds at its establishment, and these funds were used as Chun Doo-hwan's "political funds." The police announced that the donations did occur, but no evidence was found that the funds were misappropriated.

Regarding the embezzlement of "Yukyeonghoe" public funds by Chun Doo-hwan's wife, Lee Soon-ja, the police announced that the 223 billion South Korean won (approximately 300 million USD) directly handled by the Blue House, along with interest totaling 374 billion won, was all remitted except for the 2.69 billion won that Lee Soon-ja donated to a nursing home.

Regarding the issue of Chun Doo-hwan's parents' graves exceeding the regulated size, the police confirmed the guilt, but since the statute of limitations has passed, the prosecution has become invalid.

The South Korean media commented on the police's announced investigation results, stating that the police were unable to conduct a search on the political funds of the Fifth Republic and Chun Doo-hwan himself, and the core issues of the Fifth Republic remain unclear.

　　全斗焕舞弊案调查结果公布
    核心问题仍未搞清
    新华社平壤２月１日电  汉城消息：南朝鲜警方１月３１日上午公布了对第５共和国（全斗焕执政时期）舞弊案件的调查结果。
    据汉城广播电台报道，在立案的３５项调查内容中，有关全斗焕本人和“政治资金”等核心问题仍无结果。
    关于日海财团非法集资问题，作为全斗焕执政时期的智囊机构，在它成立之初，全斗焕曾要求各财团捐款，并将这些款项作为全斗焕的“政治资金”。警方宣布说，捐款确有其事，但未发现资金挪作它用。
    关于全斗焕之妻李顺子贪污“育英会”公款问题，警方宣布说，青瓦台直接经手的２２３亿南朝鲜元（７５０元约合１美元）加利息共３７４亿元，除李顺子将其中的２．６９亿元赠给了养老院外，其余部分全部上缴了。关于全斗焕父母坟地超过规定面积问题，警方确认有罪，但已超过起诉期限，起诉自然失效。
    南朝鲜舆论界对警方宣布的调查结果评论说，警方对第５共和国的政治资金和全斗焕本人没能进行搜查，第５共和国的核心问题仍未搞清楚。
