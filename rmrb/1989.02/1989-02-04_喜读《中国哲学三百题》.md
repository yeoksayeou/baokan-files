Title: Enjoying "Three Hundred Topics on Chinese Philosophy"
Author: Kang Wen
Date: 1989-02-04
Edition: 8

Shanghai Ancient Books Publishing House has distinctively published a series of "Three Hundred Topics" books, including "Three Hundred Topics on Classical Literature" and "Three Hundred Topics on Chinese Cultural History," both of which have received positive reviews from academic and literary circles. Recently, the publisher has released "Three Hundred Topics on Chinese Philosophy."

This book continues the characteristics of the "Three Hundred Topics" series: it is dense with knowledge yet explains it in a straightforward manner; it is quite systematic yet each topic stands alone; in terms of academic views, it fully absorbs previous research results, emphasizing stability, while also appropriately reflecting the personal insights and opinions of the authors; the text is written to be clear and engaging. Additionally, this book features its own unique design. Based on the characteristics of Chinese philosophy, the book is divided into five main sections: General Overview, Schools of Thought and Events, Figures and Ideas, Concepts and Propositions, and Canonical Works and Famous Essays. The General Overview section is led by prominent scholars such as Zhang Dainian, the president of the Chinese Philosophy History Society, Vice President Feng Qi, and Advisor Yan Beiming. The authors of the other sections are mostly experts in Chinese philosophy history from various universities in Shanghai. From the table of contents, it is clear that the authors of this book are relatively concentrated, with several related topics written by the same scholar. This enhances the systematic and specialized nature of the book. These experts and scholars, each of whom could write a monograph on their respective topics in terms of depth and quantity, have "lowered their standards" and collaborated to write this comprehensive book, thereby ensuring the quality of the book.

The entire book is about six to seven hundred thousand words in length, with an appropriate volume, combining the functions of a Chinese philosophy history book, a Chinese philosophy dictionary, and an introductory book on Chinese philosophy. It not only meets the needs of high school and above-level readers for self-study in Chinese philosophy but also provides knowledge and inspiration for philosophy workers, teachers, and graduate students in universities and social science academies.

　　喜读《中国哲学三百题》
　　康文
    上海古籍出版社别具一格的“三百题”系列新书，已出过《古典文学三百题》、《中国文化史三百题》等，都曾得到学术界与读书界的好评。最近，该社又推出《中国哲学三百题》。
    该书继续发扬了“三百题”的特点：既知识密集，又讲解通俗；既相当系统，又独立成篇；在学术观点上，既充分吸取以往研究成果，注意稳定性，又适当反映撰稿人的个人心得与见解；文字力求通畅，具可读性。另外，该书又有自己独特的精心设计。根据中国哲学史的特点，全书分为：总论，学派、事件，人物、思想，概念、命题，典籍、名篇等五大部分。总论部分，由中国哲学史学会会长张岱年、副会长冯契、顾问严北溟等名家打头；其余各篇的撰稿者，大多为上海各大学的中国哲学史的专家。从目录上即可看出，本书的撰写者比较集中，若干相关的条目由同一位学者撰写。这样，本书的系统性与专门性更为加强了。而这些专家学者各人所写的条目，本来从深度与数量上，都可以写成一本本专著的；而他们“放低手眼”，齐心协力，合作撰写这样一部大书，从而确保了本书的质量。
    全书六七十万字，篇幅适中，集中国哲学史、中国哲学史辞典、中国哲学入门书的功用于一体，不仅适合于高中以上程度的读者自学中国哲学的需要，就是大学和社科院的哲学工作者、教师与研究生，又何尝不能从中获得知识与启示呢？
