West German Central Bank Actively Intervenes in Foreign Exchange Market to Suppress Further Rise in Dollar-to-West German Mark Exchange Rate

New China News Agency, Bonn, February 7 (Reporter Dài Lǚbīn) Following yesterday's joint intervention in the foreign exchange market with the central banks of the United States and some Western European countries, the West German central bank, the Deutsche Bundesbank, today sold 16.7 million US dollars in the Frankfurt foreign exchange market to "balance the market" and suppress the further rise in the dollar-to-West German Mark exchange rate.

Therefore, today's dollar-to-West German Mark exchange rate in the Frankfurt foreign exchange market stabilized at 1:1.8733, a drop of more than 1 fenni from yesterday's 1:1.8853.

Over the past period, the dollar-to-West German Mark exchange rate has been continuously rising. Yesterday, the dollar-to-West German Mark exchange rate in the Frankfurt foreign exchange market rose to its highest level in four months, reaching 1:1.8853. Compared to the beginning of the year, the dollar's exchange rate has appreciated by 7%. Foreign exchange dealers believe that the rise in the dollar's exchange rate is inseparable from the following two factors. First, some people believe that the United States will inevitably raise interest rates; second, the United States announced last week that employment has improved, making people believe that the U.S. economy will maintain a "boom."

Another factor contributing to the rise in the dollar-to-West German Mark exchange rate is that the West German central bank today denied that West Germany and Japan have reached an agreement to strengthen the West German Mark. The West German central bank also denied that there is any agreement among the seven Western countries to enhance the status of the West German Mark.

　　西德中央银行大力干预外汇市场
    抑制美元对西德马克比价继续上扬
    新华社波恩2月7日电　（记者戴履斌）继昨天同美国及西欧一些国家中央银行联合干预外汇市场后，西德中央银行——德意志联邦银行今天又在法兰克福外汇市场抛售1670万美元，以“平衡市场”和抑制美元对西德马克比价继续上扬。
    因此，今天法兰克福外汇市场美元对西德马克的比价稳定在1∶1.8733的水平上，比昨天的1∶1.8853下跌1芬尼多。
    近一段时间来，美元对西德马克的比价不断上升。昨天在法兰克福外汇市场上，美元对西德马克比价曾上升到4个月以来的最高水平，达1∶1.8853。同年初相比，美元比价增值7％。外汇商认为，美元汇价上升是同以下两个因素分不开的。一、一些人认为美国必将提高利率；二、美国上周宣布就业有所改善，使人们相信美国经济将保持“景气”。
    促使美元对西德马克比价上扬的另一个因素是，西德中央银行今天否认西德同日本之间达成关于加强西德马克的协议。西德中央银行同时也否认西方七国有增强西德马克地位的有关协议。
