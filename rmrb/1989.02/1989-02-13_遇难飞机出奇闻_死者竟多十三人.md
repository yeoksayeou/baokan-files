A bizarre development has emerged from the crash of a Boeing 707 in the Azores. It has been revealed that the number of victims is not 144 but 157, meaning there are 13 additional "secret" victims.

This information was disclosed by the Italian ambassador to Portugal to the media. The identities of these 13 "extra passengers" and how they boarded the plane remain unknown. Today, *La Repubblica* described the incident as a "major mystery" in the Azores plane crash.

Over the past two days, speculation about the cause of the crash has been rampant. Journalists on the scene have been trying to gather information from investigators, but have not received satisfactory answers. *La Repubblica* reported, "The truth is unclear, and doubts are increasing."

Last night, investigators found the second black box. The first black box has already been sent to Lisbon for expert analysis. People are hoping that these two black boxes will provide answers.

The crash of the Boeing 707 has sparked a debate in Italy about the use of cheap chartered flights. Some argue that the plane's age increases the risk of accidents.

　　遇难飞机出奇闻  死者竟多十三人
    新华社罗马２月１１日电  此间今日传出的消息说，在亚速尔群岛遇难的波音７０７客机上，死者不是１４４名而是１５７名，即多出１３名“秘密死者”。
    这是意大利驻葡萄牙大使对新闻界透露的。这些“额外死者”是如何登上飞机的至今无人知晓。今天《共和国报》称，１３人“秘密登机”是亚速尔群岛飞机惨案的“一大奇闻”。
    两天来，此间舆论对飞机遇难的原因猜测颇多。赶到现场的记者想方设法从调查人员那里了解真象，但无法得到满意的答复。《共和国报》说，“真象未明，疑点增多”。
    昨晚调查人员找到了第二个黑匣子。第一个黑匣子已送到里斯本供专家研究。人们期待这两个黑匣子能提供答案。
    波音７０７遇难在意大利引起了对租用廉价飞机的辩论。有人认为飞机使用时间太长，易出危险。
