The China Acrobatics Troupe, which was once on the brink of closure due to semi-paralysis, has regained its vitality through reform. In 1988, the troupe significantly increased its performance schedule and economic income, ranking first among the 10 performing arts groups in Beijing.

The China Acrobatics Troupe was established in 1950, gathering the country's top acrobatic talents. It has performed in over 60 countries and is renowned both domestically and internationally. However, due to the "iron rice bowl," "iron chair," and "big pot of rice" system under the old regime, the enthusiasm of performers and staff gradually waned, leading to a severe decline in artistic production. Some performers did not attend work for years, the circus troupe was paralyzed, many animals fell ill or died, the practice rooms were deserted, and most performers went out to perform privately.

In November 1987, the China Acrobatics Troupe implemented reforms for performing arts groups. Lin Jian, a 38-year-old from the Department of Education at Beijing Normal University, was appointed by the Municipal Bureau of Culture as the acting director of the troupe. Lin Jian first implemented a contract system across the troupe, hiring 282 people, and made proper arrangements for the 43 who were not hired.

Previously, the troupe had two "big pots of rice" in distribution. One was that administrative staff received statutory subsidies, eating the troupe's "big pot of rice." The other was that the troupe ate the bureau's "big pot of rice," receiving statutory funds from the bureau every year. After the reform, the troupe adopted a method combining organizational arrangements with self-arranged performances and profit-sharing. It was stipulated that each person would receive a subsidy of 5 yuan per performance, with leading roles receiving an additional 2 yuan and supporting roles an additional 1 yuan, increasing with the number of performances. They also signed a contract with the Municipal Bureau of Culture for a 100-yuan business income including subsidy, thereby mobilizing the enthusiasm of all performers in the troupe. In just 1988, they performed 729 shows, double the number in 1987, with performance income reaching 1.1 million yuan, equivalent to one and a half times the total business income from 1985 to 1987.

The China Acrobatics Troupe also formulated other management measures. They emphasized that cadres should lead by example, and in October last year, deducted position allowances and bonuses from four mid-level cadres who violated regulations. The troupe stipulated that individuals going out to perform privately must obtain approval from the troupe, and the income must be shared by the troupe. Those found to have deserted their posts and performed privately would have their income confiscated and, in serious cases, be dismissed.

The fundamental purpose of performing arts group reforms is to improve artistic quality and better serve the audience. To this end, the acrobatics troupe established an information and research room, a design and creation room, and a public relations department to timely understand and study the development of domestic and international peers, adapting to the competitive situation and the needs of artistic production.

### 旧体制消磨演职员积极性  改革使中国杂技团重振雄风

　　旧体制消磨演职员积极性
　  改革使中国杂技团重振雄风
    据新华社北京２月９日电  （记者张宝瑞、王岳龙）一度处于半瘫痪、濒临摘牌危险的中国杂技团，通过改革焕发了生机。１９８８年，这个团演出场次和经济收入大大增加，跃居北京市属１０个文艺团体之首。
    中国杂技团是１９５０年集全国杂技精英组建的，曾赴６０多个国家演出，享誉中外。但由于旧体制下形成的“铁饭碗”、“铁交椅”和“大锅饭”，渐渐消磨了演职员的积极性，艺术生产严重滑坡。有些演职员几年不上班，马戏队瘫痪，动物死病甚多，练功房冷冷清清，大多数演员出外“走穴”。
    １９８７年１１月，中国杂技团实行了文艺团体的改革。北京师范大学教育系３８岁的林建应市文化局聘请担任了杂技团代理团长。林建首先在全团实行了聘任制，共聘任２８２人，对未聘任的４３人也作了妥善安排。
    过去这个团在分配上有两个“大锅饭”，一个是业务人员有法定的补贴，吃团里的“大锅饭”。另一个是团里吃局里的“大锅饭”，年年拿局里法定的经费。改革后，团里实行了组织统一安排与各队自行联系演出分成相结合的办法，规定每场每人补助５元，主演加２元、陪演加１元按演出次数递增。他们还与市文化局签订了百元业务收入含经费补贴量办法，从而调动了全团演员的积极性，仅１９８８年一年就演出７２９场，比１９８７年增加了两倍，演出收入１１０万元，相当于１９８５年至１９８７年业务收入总和的一倍半。
    中国杂技团还制订了其他管理措施。他们强调干部要以身作则，去年１０月对４名违反制度的中层干部扣发了岗位津贴和奖金。团里规定个人出外“走穴”须经团里批准，收入也要由团里提成。对擅离职守私演私分者，一经发现，轻则没收收入，重则解聘。
    文艺团体改革的根本目的是提高艺术质量，更好地为观众服务。为此，杂技团成立了信息资料研究室、设计创编室和公共关系部，及时了解、研究国内外同行的发展，以适应竞争形势和发展艺术生产的需要。
