Since November 1988, our palace has successively purchased 13,000 calendars from Beijing, Jinzhou, and other places. Without a business license and without a sales task, our palace adopts the method of issuing fake invoices and fake receipts for sales. By the time I wrote this letter, our palace had sold 5,300 calendars, all of which were purchased with cash or checks by various units.

　　有人公款买挂历  我宫乱开假发票
    一九八八年十一月以来，我宫先后从北京、锦州等地购进一万三千本挂历。在没有营业执照，没有销售任务的情况下，我宫采取开假发票、假收据的办法销售。在我写信时，我宫已卖出的五千三百本挂历，都是被一些单位用现金、支票买去的。
