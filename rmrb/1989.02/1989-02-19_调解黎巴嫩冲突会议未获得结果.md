A mediation meeting held on February 17 to resolve the conflict between the Lebanese government forces and the "Lebanese Forces" did not achieve any results.

This meeting, attended by prominent figures from the religious and political spheres in Beirut's northern suburbs, saw heated debates over two proposals. The first proposal called for the "Lebanese Forces" militia to withdraw from East Beirut, but it was opposed by their commander, Bashir Gemayel. The second proposal allowed for the joint military presence of both sides in East Beirut, but it was rejected by the government forces commander, Michel Aoun.

　　调解黎巴嫩冲突会议未获得结果
    为调解黎巴嫩政府军和“黎巴嫩力量”之间的冲突而于十七日召开的基督教会议没有取得任何结果。
    这次由宗教界和政治界知名人士参加的在贝鲁特北部召开的会议上，提出的两个建议引起激烈的争吵，第一个建议要求“黎巴嫩”民兵撤出贝鲁特东区，但遭到了它的司令盖亚盖亚的反对；第二个建议允许双方在贝鲁特东区的共同军事存在，但遭到了政府军司令奥恩的拒绝。
