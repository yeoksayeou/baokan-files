Guilin has the "First Heavenly Cave" of Qixingyan and the "Natural Art Palace" of Ludiyanyan. I have also seen a grand view of a cave—the Yiling Rock in Wuming County, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.

Driving 32 kilometers north from Nanning, you arrive at Yiling Village in Shuangqiao Township, Wuming County. This small village, though not densely populated and not particularly rich in resources, boasts the Yiling Rock, of which the locals are justifiably proud. Recently, geologists and archaeologists have examined the Yiling Rock and confirmed that the formation of this rock layer has a history of over a million years. Originally, this area was an underground riverbed. Later, due to the Earth's evolution and the uplift of the crust, a cave was formed. Rainwater seeped through the cracks in the roof of the cave, dissolving the carbonate rocks inside, and solidifying into various shapes of stalactites. Some of these are still developing and growing. The currently accessible cave tour is slightly shorter than the combined tours of Ludiyanyan and Qixingyan in Guilin, with an internal area of over 24,000 square meters, divided into three levels of corridors.

The exterior of Yiling Rock appears quite ordinary. It lacks the rugged beauty of Lushan's Jinxiu Valley or the graceful elegance of Wuyi's Yufei Peak. The cave entrance is covered with shrubs and bamboo. If it weren't for the rock wall at the top of the entrance, weathered to reveal the carved characters "Yiling Rock," I would never have imagined that this was the location of the famed "First Cave of China."

The first sight upon entering the cave is the "Two Lions Welcoming Guests." Under the colorful lights, the two lions appear lively and charming, quite endearing. The cave starts with a lion dance to welcome guests, showcasing the ancient Chinese custom of celebration, a scene not found in other cave attractions. This auspicious sight immediately gives visitors a good feeling. Following this are the graceful figures of Zhuang women, ancient banyan trees, and the mountains and rivers of the Zhuang homeland, forming the vast "Joyous Zhuang Homeland" scenic area, reflecting the rich Zhuang culture and local landscape.

Crossing the "Sky Bridge" and traversing the "Red Water Riverbank," you arrive at the "Seaside Park," the highest and largest scenic area in Yiling Rock. Among its sights, the "Underwater Wonder" is particularly impressive, resembling vast seas with surging waves.

Legend has it that during the Southern Song Dynasty's Kaixi and Jiading periods (1205–1224 AD), a Daoist named Zhou Shiqing traveled to Yiling and found this place to be a sacred land for immortals. He built a hermitage here to cultivate himself and eventually attained immortality within the rock. Later generations named Yiling "Wanxian Rock" and built a temple at the mountain peak called the Immortal Mountain Temple.

No wonder the Daoist was enchanted and forgot to return. Today, we toured 8 scenic areas and over 100 sights, feeling that the entire cave is like a long scroll of natural art depicting the Zhuang homeland and classical mythology. As we exited the lower level of the cave, the sound of the lusheng (a traditional Zhuang musical instrument) playing a farewell tune echoed within, its melody soft and tender, leaving a lasting impression.

　　伊岭岩
    黄良正
    桂林有号为“第一洞天”的七星岩、荣膺“大自然艺术宫”美称的芦笛岩，我还看到一个岩洞的大观——广西壮族自治区武鸣县的伊岭岩。
    从南宁往北行驶３２公里，就到了武鸣县双桥乡的伊岭村。这个小村庄，虽然人口不多，物产也不甚丰富，但有座伊岭岩，当地人也足以引为自豪。前不久，地质考古学家对伊岭岩做了鉴定，肯定了这座岩层的形成曾经历了一百多万年的历史。原先这里是一段地下河道，后来地球演变，地壳上升，便形成了岩洞，雨水沿着岩顶裂缝，渗入洞内，溶解洞中的炭酸盐类石块，凝结而成各种形状的钟乳石，有些现在还在发育成长，目前开放的洞内游程，比桂林的芦笛岩七星岩总和稍短一些，洞内面积有２．４万多平方米，分上中下三层甬道。
    伊岭岩外貌看去极为平常，既无庐山锦绣谷峻俏，也没有武夷玉女峰秀丽，洞口被灌木和竹子覆盖着，若不是洞口上端那块因风化而成的岩壁上凿有“伊岭岩”三字，我真不敢想象这就是被人传神了的中国岩洞之首的所在地。
    入洞第一景便是“双狮迎宾”，两只雄狮在缤纷的灯光下活灵活现，十分可爱。入洞率先以狮舞迎宾客来展示中华民族古老的欢庆习俗场面，是其他岩洞胜地所没有的，这种有吉祥含义的景点，使游人马上产生了良好的心理感觉。接着是由袅袅婷婷的壮家女群像、壮乡的参天古榕、壮乡的山河所构成的庞大的“欢乐的壮乡”景区，反映出浓郁的壮家情调和壮乡风貌。
    穿越“空中走廊”，涉跨“红水河畔”，来到“海滨公园”，这是伊岭岩最高最大的景区。其中“海底奇观”一景，气势非凡，似万里海疆，波涛汹涌。
    相传在南宋开禧、嘉定年间（公元１２０５—１２２４年），有位叫周师庆的道士云游四海来到伊岭，看中了这块成仙宝地，在此“结庵修炼”、“坐化岩中”。后人把伊岭叫做“望仙岩”，并在山顶建造了一座仙山寺。
    怪不得道士迷而忘返，今日我们游了８个景区１００多个景点，觉得全洞似乎是一幅壮乡风貌和古典神话的大自然艺术长轴画卷。从岩洞的下层出口时，洞内响起了芦笙吹奏的送客曲，旋律婉转，柔情蜜意，令人久久难忘。
