After reading Zhao Yu's reportage literature "Defeat in Seoul" (published in the December 1988 issue of "Wenhui Monthly"), one's feelings are indeed as he described: "filled with so many contradictions, so much pain!" This contradiction and pain are actually shared by those in this era who have a sense of history and responsibility. This is also the result of a long period of pain caused by the collision, transformation, and integration of traditional and modern spirits, Eastern and Western civilizations. We admire Zhao Yu's courage and strength demonstrated in "Defeat in Seoul" and his previous work "Dream of a Strong Nation." This courage and strength come from his reflection on the sports spirit of today's China. In his view, "Sports that showcase individual strength and charm can help transform and rebuild the traditional personality and shriveled personality, which is the most positive meaning of developing sports."

"Conversely, only by cultivating our personality can we truly promote sports reform, and Chinese sports can truly soar to the world" ("Defeat in Seoul"). However, in front of the Chinese sports world that is obsessed with the number of gold medals, all this seems very distant. "Defeat in Seoul" actually regards the spread of the non-sports spirit as the deep-seated reason for the Chinese Olympic team's stumble in Seoul. It best proclaims that under the guidance of the non-sports spirit in today's China, the "sports power" is just a dream that makes one shed tears.

"Defeat in Seoul" reveals the complex mindset of sports officials, athletes, coaches, and young and middle-aged sports theorists through tracking interviews after the Chinese Olympic team's return. The author's indignation is evident in a series of incidents he witnessed. Li Yaoxian's self-narration, the "endless suppression" in the hearts of athletes including Li Ning, the many unpleasant events in the reporters' camp, and the different thoughts of the State Sports Commission officials and young and middle-aged sports theorists after the competition confirm the author's insightful analysis of the current state of Chinese sports before the 24th Olympic Games. It alerts people that suppressing non-sports concepts and advocating the Olympic sports spirit is an urgent task:

	— The author begins by comparing the physical condition of Chinese and Japanese children with a large amount of data, the result of which is that "the health condition of Chinese teenagers is even worse than the results of the 1979 United Nations survey." This is actually the work of non-sports concepts, that is, the author's question: "Is the function of the Sports Commission to lead the whole nation to carry out solid and practical physical fitness activities, or is it to focus solely on improving the level of competitive sports?"

	— The defeat of the women's volleyball coach Li Yaoxian in Seoul is because he has neither power, nor emotion, nor authority, which makes it difficult for him to move forward in the "network" of the sports world. The author compares the women's volleyball team to a ship loaded with honors and responsibilities, carrying the old diseases and ailments of a thousand years. "Behind Li Yaoxian, behind the Chinese women's volleyball team, there is the burden of our culture." This is again the bitter fruit of the non-sports spirit—everything is entangled with politics.

	— The "endless suppression" oppresses a group of gymnasts led by Li Ning. He could have retired honorably after the previous Olympic Games, but now, to repay his country, he fails and is despised as the "son of gymnastics." How can such an atmosphere of victory and praise, defeat and blame, allow athletes to unfold their personalities? The utilitarianism and favoritism of judging success and failure are undoubtedly another non-sports concept.

Sports should not be alienated; sports are sports, just as art is art, literature is literature, and science is science. Any substitution or imposition can only distort the original. The spread of the non-sports spirit in China is similar to the spread of the non-art spirit. It is actually the shadow of feudal concepts and personality in contemporary China. It is time to wake up.

Several decades ago, several hundred years ago, Westerners called us "the sick man of East Asia." If we do not change the non-sports concepts or other non-art, non-literature, non-science concepts in Chinese sports and other fields, we can imagine that in the not-too-distant future, we will once again become the "sick man of East Asia" in terms of physique. This may not be an exaggeration.

### 非体育精神的剖露——评报告文学《兵败汉城》

　　非体育精神的剖露
    ——评报告文学《兵败汉城》
    王晖　南平
    读完赵瑜的报告文学《兵败汉城》（载《文汇月刊》一九八八年第十二期），心情诚如他所言：“充斥着多少矛盾，多少痛楚！”这矛盾与痛楚其实正是这个时代有历史感、责任感的人们所共有的。这也是由传统精神与现代精神、东方文明与西方文明交汇、碰撞、转换的长时期阵痛所引发。我们钦佩赵瑜在《兵败汉城》及其前作《强国梦》中表现出来的勇气和力量。这种勇气和力量来自于对今日中国体育精神的思考。在他看来，“展示个性力量、张扬个性魅力的体育本身，正有助于对传统的人格，萎缩了人格的改造和重建，这正是我们发展体育运动的最积极的含义”。
    “反过来，只有健全我们的人格，才能真正推动体育的改革，中华体育才能真正腾飞于全世界”（《兵败汉城》），而在沉迷于金牌数的中国体育界面前，这一切似乎离得很远，《兵败汉城》实际上是把非体育精神的弥漫，作为中国奥运军团汉城失蹄的深层原因。它再好不过地宣告了，在当今中国非体育精神指导下的“体育强国”不过是个令人潸然泪下的“梦”。
    《兵败汉城》通过对中国奥运军团归国后的追踪采访，真实剖露了体育界官员、运动员、教练员及中青年体育理论工作者的复杂心态，作者以耳闻目睹的一系列使他愤懑。李耀先的自述、包括李宁在内的运动员内心“无边的压抑”、记者营中诸多令人不快的事件、国家体委官员与中青年体育理论工作者在赛后的不同想法，证实了作者在二十四届奥运会前夕对中国体育现状的中肯分析。它警醒人们，抑制非体育观念、宏扬奥林匹克体育精神已是当务之急：  　——作者开篇便以大量数据将中国与日本儿童的身体素质进行了对比，其结果是“中国青少年的健康状况比起一九七九年那次联合国调查的结果，更有恶化的趋势”，这其实是非体育观念在作祟，即作者所追问的：“体委的职能，到底是领导全民族扎扎实实地开展强身健体的体育活动呢，还是单搞竞技运动水平的提高？”
    ——女排教练李耀先兵败汉城，是因为他手中既无权、又无情、也无威，这在体育界的“关系网”中必然寸步难行。作者把女排比作满载荣誉与重托的航船，它满载着千百年来的老病沉疴。“李耀先背后，中国女排背后，有着我们文化的重负。”这又是非体育精神——凡事均与政治牵挂的苦果。
    ——“无边的压抑”压抑着以李宁为首的一帮体操运动员，他本可以在上届奥运会之后光荣退役，如今为报效祖国，竟功亏一篑，被人耻为“体操亡子”，这种胜则誉，败则损的氛围，如何能使运动员舒展个性呢？以成败论英雄的实用主义、势利眼，无疑是又一种非体育观念。
    体育不能异化，体育就是体育，诚如艺术就是艺术、文学就是文学、科学就是科学一样。任何替代与强加于人，都只能使原物扭曲。非体育精神在中国的弥漫与非艺术精神的弥漫一样，它其实是封建观念与人格在当代中国留下的阴影。是该警醒的时刻了。
    几十年前、几百年前，西洋人骂我们是“东亚病夫”。如果不改变中国体育甚至其它领域中的非体育观念或其他非艺术、非文学、非科学观念，也就可以想象不远的将来，我们还将会再次沦为体质的“东亚病夫”，这也许不能算是危言耸听的。
