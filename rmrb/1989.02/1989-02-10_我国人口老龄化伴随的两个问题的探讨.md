The development of population has its own laws. From the situation in China over the past 40 years since the founding of the nation, it is clear that by the year 2000, the population structure will have entered an aged pattern, and the speed of population aging in the 21st century will accelerate. The seriousness of this problem has attracted the attention of people both at home and abroad. This article will discuss two issues that accompany population aging.

The first issue: The support of the elderly

1. The main body responsible for supporting the elderly in the 21st century will shift from the family to society.

According to relevant units, by the year 2000, the proportion of people aged 65 and above in China's total population will reach 7%. By 2040, the number of elderly people will reach its peak, approximately 260 million, accounting for 17.4% of the total population. How to support and care for such a large elderly population is a problem that must be given early attention and seriously addressed.

In China, the traditional custom is for the family to be mainly responsible for supporting and caring for the elderly. Parents raising children and children supporting their parents is a traditional Chinese virtue. This tradition should be carried forward. At the same time, as a means to solve the social problem of supporting the elderly, it should also be continuously advocated.

However, as the number of elderly people in the total population continues to increase and the proportion of young people relatively decreases, it is practically difficult for children to fully support the elderly. First, this century advocates that a young couple should have only one child, which will inevitably lead to an overlarge support ratio for the next generation. Second, with the progress of society, China's traditional large families have begun to disintegrate and will continue to do so, and the number of elderly people living separately from their children is gradually increasing. These factors determine that the support for the elderly will shift from being mainly the responsibility of children to being mainly the responsibility of society, becoming an inevitable trend.

2. Reform the system and establish a new social security system.

The fundamental solution to the problem of supporting the elderly in the 21st century lies in establishing and improving a new social security system. Currently, China's elderly care system is very incomplete and has many problems that need to be reformed. The existing system has the following problems:

1. The current retirement system does not include all members of society. Currently, only about 30% of all social laborers can enjoy retirement benefits. A considerable number of laborers, after becoming old and weak, cannot receive retirement benefits, and their lives lack security.

2. The current old-age retirement benefits are fully borne by enterprises and the state budget, with laborers themselves not contributing. Under the past "low-wage" conditions, this had to be the case. With the increase in the number of retirees, the burden is becoming heavier and heavier. In the 21st century, the number of retirees will increase rapidly, and retirement benefits will increase significantly. It will be difficult to bear the entire burden of retirement benefits for enterprises and the state.

3. The current method of raising retirement benefits also has problems. The retirement benefits of employees of state-owned and collective enterprises are borne by the enterprises, forming a situation where each enterprise supports its own elderly. Due to the different proportions of elderly retirees in the total number of employees in each enterprise, the burden on each enterprise will inevitably be uneven. New enterprises have a lighter burden, while old enterprises have a heavier burden. In some old enterprises, the number of retirees and the amount of retirement benefits each account for 50% of the total number of employees and the total wage bill.

4. Each enterprise bearing the burden of supporting the elderly is not conducive to production development and improving the living conditions of employees. Especially in old enterprises, the proportion of retirement benefits in the enterprise's income is increasing, and the proportion of production funds for expanding reproduction and technological transformation is decreasing, which is not conducive to the development of production. In the increased consumption fund, the proportion of retirement benefits is expanding, and the part used to increase the bonuses and welfare of employees in service is relatively shrinking, which is not conducive to improving the treatment of employees and will also affect the enthusiasm of employees, ultimately hindering the development of production.

In summary, the problem of supporting the elderly is already a very real issue and not a distant future problem. It must be put on the agenda, and measures must be taken from now on to gradually establish a new social security system.

The new social security system should ensure that all laborers have a secure old age and should not only guarantee one part of the people while not guaranteeing another part. Not only workers, peasants, and cadres, but also all laborers in various economic sectors should enjoy old-age insurance. Not only laborers themselves, but also family members of laborers who voluntarily participate should be able to enjoy old-age insurance.

The old-age insurance in the new social security system should adopt a pension system different from the so-called "coordinated" method. The pension for retirees should not only be borne by enterprises and the state (for state employees), but should be jointly borne by laborers themselves and their affiliated units. The current regulation of old-age insurance in the Federal Republic of Germany is 10% of the total wage (18.7% in 1983), with labor and management each providing 50%. There are some good experiences in this regard in Western countries that we can learn from.

To establish a new social security system, relevant laws must be formulated to regulate the methods of providing and managing old-age funds and the methods of use. The collection, management, and use of old-age funds must be conducted in accordance with the law. Old-age funds must be specially managed and used by labor protection agencies. To cope with the depreciation of retirement funds due to inflation, the old-age insurance department can use this money for investment and operation to make it grow, so as to ensure that employees can receive the pensions they deserve after retirement.

The second issue: The aging of the labor force

Generally speaking, the aging of the labor force is faster than the aging of the population. Since the 1970s, China's birth rate has been gradually decreasing. From over 30‰ in the 1960s to around 20‰ in the 1980s. The death rate has also decreased, with only over 6‰ in the 1970s. By the year 2000, the population will enter an aged pattern, and at the same time, the average age of the labor force will increase, and the proportion of elderly people in the labor-age population will increase. It is estimated that by 2015, people aged 45 and above in the total labor-age population will account for as high as 60%.

According to predictions, in the year 2000, the labor supply population in China will still account for 53% of the total population. By 2015, this proportion will decrease to around 40%, a decrease of 13 percentage points. It is estimated that by 2015, the total population will be 1.38 billion, and the labor supply population will be 560 million. In the future, due to the continuous decline in the birth rate in the last 30 years of this century, the labor supply population will further decrease.

Around 2015, the population born after the founding of the nation will gradually retire from the labor age, with about 20 million people each year, while the number of young laborers replacing them each year will be only over 10 million, and in some years it may be less than 10 million. The proportion of elderly people in the labor-age population will inevitably increase.

The decrease in the number of laborers and the increase in the number of elderly people in the labor-age population will first have an adverse impact on the development of the national economy, and the expansion of production and the opening of new industries will encounter the problem of a shortage of labor resources. Second, it will affect the annual replenishment of soldiers, which is not conducive to strengthening national defense construction.

In recent years, the academic community in China has had different views on the future population aging and the relative shortage of labor force that follows. One view is that in the 21st century, with the development of science and technology, labor productivity will increase, and the demand for labor in technology-intensive industries will decrease, and the problem of labor supply will not be a concern.

It cannot be denied that with the development of science and technology, some industries will be able to use technology to replace labor. However, it must also be seen that the development of science and technology will inevitably lead to the opening of new industries. New industries will inevitably have new demands for labor. From the trend of social development, the improvement of labor productivity and the progress of science and technology will always expand social demand and stimulate production, thereby opening up new industries and increasing employment. The invention of the steam engine made textile mills eliminate millions of hand-operated spinning wheels, but at the same time, it created the entire industrial age, absorbing tens of millions of laborers. Therefore, we cannot think that the improvement of productivity and the development of science and technology will not lead to a shortage of labor supply.

Facing the aging of the labor population in the 21st century, the following problems need to be studied and solved.

First, insist on and improve family planning work. The goal of family planning is not only to control population growth but also to adjust the birth rate, so that the number of laborers growing each year is relatively balanced. Controlling the time of population birth may make the number of people reaching the labor age each year not too concentrated, avoiding the situation of alternating labor employment tension and labor resource shortage.

Second, improve the quality of the labor force to make up for the shortage in quantity. By the 21st century, with the realization of the 2000-year strategic goal, the quality of the labor force will be greatly improved. In terms of physical quality, due to changes in diet structure, improvement of living environment and working conditions, reduction of working hours, and increase of labor protection, medical and health care facilities, the physique of the population will be greatly enhanced. The cultural quality of the population in the 21st century will also be greatly improved. The popularization of compulsory education, the development of vocational education, and the improvement of people's cultural and scientific knowledge and vocational skills. The development of higher education will cultivate a large number of professionals, engineers, and managerial talents who master modern advanced science and technology.

The key to improving the quality of the labor force lies in education. In order to enable various sectors and industries of the national economy in the 21st century to obtain sufficient laborers who are both talented and physically strong, efforts must be made from now on to improve the work of education. Education funds should be increased, and the education system should be reformed. In addition to reforming teaching methods, improving teaching content, and running various levels and types of schools, an open policy should be implemented to encourage and promote social capital investment in education, democratic parties' education, and private education to make up for the shortage of national education funds. The social status of teachers should be improved, and the wages of teachers should be increased to encourage more people to engage in the education industry.

Third, consider extending the working age and delaying retirement. China's current retirement system is still the one stipulated in the 1950s, with men retiring at 60 and women at 55, and those engaged in physical labor in enterprises retiring 5 years earlier. More than 30 years have passed, and the situation has changed, but the regulations have not been changed. Especially since the 1980s, the possibility of delaying the retirement age has emerged. In recent years, many experts and technical personnel have been re-hired by their original units after retirement, and a large number of retired scientific and technical personnel and skilled workers have played an important role in collective and township enterprises. On the other hand, more cadres and workers are still in good health at the age of 60, and after retirement, they have nothing to do, which makes them depressed and accelerates their physical and mental aging. The facts show that the current retirement age can be delayed. In the 21st century, the physical quality of the population will be better than it is now, and it is completely possible to delay the retirement age by five years.

Fourth, make full use of labor resources. For half a century, until now, China is still a country with almost unlimited labor supply. Due to various reasons, labor waste is serious, especially the waste of talents is shocking. This situation must be changed.

In the long run, surplus agricultural laborers should be transferred to various fields of non-agricultural industries to play a role. In recent years, several million agricultural laborers have already been transferred out. The flow has begun, and the barriers between urban and rural areas have been initially broken through. However, at present, there are still no unified opinions on some theoretical and practical problems related to labor mobility.

At present, the situation of wasting labor resources due to excessive personnel must be resolutely changed. It is estimated that the number of surplus personnel in state-owned enterprises is 15% to 20% of the total number of employees, about 20 million. At present, various places are adopting the method of "optimizing the labor combination" to implement "unemployment within the factory," from not acknowledging unemployment to acknowledging unemployment, changing hidden unemployment to open unemployment, which is a progress and helps to change the traditional concept that socialist countries have no unemployment. However, the method of reducing surplus personnel and then having the enterprise itself digest them may not be a long-term solution and cannot fundamentally solve the problem. It should be allowed for surplus personnel to enter society, forming a labor market with unemployed people in society and farmers who have entered the city but have not yet found jobs, and seeking the best combination with production resources under equal competition conditions.

　　我国人口老龄化伴随的两个问题的探讨
　　冯兰瑞
    人口的发展有它自身的规律。从我国建国４０年的情况看，２０００年人口结构进入老年型的格局已定，２１世纪人口老龄化的速度将会加快。这个问题的严重性已引起国内外人士的关注。本文只对与人口老龄化伴随的两个问题作一些探讨。
    　　　　第一个问题：老年人的赡养
    一、２１世纪老年赡养的承担主体将由家庭转向社会。
    据有关单位预测，２０００年我国６５岁以上的老人在总人口中的比重将达７％，２０４０年老人数将达到最高峰值，约２．６亿，比重为１７．４％。对这样巨大的老年人口群如何赡养和照料，是必须及早重视和认真对待的问题。
    我国的传统习惯，老年人的赡养照料主要依靠家庭，父母养育子女、子女供养老人是中国人的传统道德。这种传统应该发扬。同时，作为解决赡养老人这个社会问题的办法之一，也应该继续提倡。
    但是，随着老年人在总人口中的数量日益增大，年轻人的比重相对较小，完全由子女赡养老人事实上难以做到。首先，本世纪提倡一对年轻夫妇只生育一个子女，必然导致下一代人负担的赡养系数过大。其次，随着社会的进步，我国传统的大家庭已经开始并继续瓦解，老人同子女分居的数量逐渐增多。这些都决定对老人的赡养从子女负责为主转向以社会为主，成为一种必然趋势。
    二、改革体制，建立新的社会保障制度。
    根本解决２１世纪老年人的赡养问题，出路在于建立和健全新的社会保障制度。目前我国老年保障制度很不完备，弊病很多，必须加以改造。现行制度有如下问题：
    １、现行的离退休制度不包括全体社会成员。目前能够享受离退休待遇的人约占全体社会劳动者的３０％，相当多的劳动者，年老力衰以后不能领取离退休金，生活难有保障。
    ２、现行老年离退休金全部由企业和国家财政负担，劳动者本人不交纳。在过去实行“低薪制”条件下不得不如此。随着离退休人员增加，负担越来越重。２１世纪，退休人员迅速增加，退休金随之大幅度增加，全部由企业和国家负担将难以承受。
    ３、现行退休金的筹集办法也有问题。全民所有制和集体所有制企业职工的退休金由企业负担，形成企业各自养老。由于各个企业老年退休职工在职工总数中的比例不同，各企业的负担势必畸轻畸重。新企业负担轻，老企业负担重。有的老企业退休人员和退休金额分别占职工总数和工资总额的５０％。
    ４、企业各自负担养老对于发展生产、改善职工生活均不利。特别是老企业支付的养老金过多，企业收入中消费基金份额增加，用于扩大再生产、技术改造的生产基金份额减少，对生产发展不利。在增加了的消费基金中，养老金的比例扩大，用于增加在职职工奖金和福利的部分相对缩小，不利于改善职工待遇，也会影响职工积极性的发挥，最终也会阻碍生产的发展。
    总之，老年赡养问题，已经是一个很现实而非遥远将来的事，必须提上日程，从现在起就要采取措施，逐步建立起一种新的社会保障制度。
    新的社会保障制度应该做到全部劳动者都老有所养，不能够只保障一部分人而不保障另一部分人。不仅工人、农民、干部，而且多种经济成份中所有的劳动者都应享受老年保险；不仅劳动者本人，而且劳动者的家庭成员中自愿参加者也应能享受老年保险。
    新的社会保障制度中的老年保险应采用与所谓“统筹”办法不同的老年年金制。退休人员的养老金不应只由企业和国家（对国家工作人员）负担，应由劳动者本人及其所属单位共同负担。联邦德国老年保险金现在的规定是总工资的１０％（１９８３年是１８．７％），劳资双方各提供５０％，西方国家这方面有一些好的经验我们可以借鉴。
    为了建立新的社会保障制度，必须制定有关法律，规定老年基金的提供办法和管理办法、使用办法。老年保险基金的筹集管理和使用，必须依法办事。老年基金必须由劳动保障机构专门管理专项使用。为了对付由于通货膨胀带来的退休基金贬值，老年保险部门可以用这笔钱去投资经营，使它增殖，以保证职工退休后能够拿到应有的养老金。
    　　　　第二个问题：劳动力的老化
    一般说，劳动力老化比人口老化更快。我国自７０年代以来，出生率逐渐下降。从６０年代的３０‰以上下降到８０年代的２０‰上下。死亡率也下降，７０年代以来只有６‰多一点。２０００年人口进入老年型，与此同时，劳动力平均年龄增高，劳动年龄人口中高龄人口的比重加大。预计到２０１５年，劳动力中４５岁以上的人在总劳动年龄人口中的比重将高达６０％。
    据预测，２０００年我国劳动供给人口还占总人口的５３％。到了２０１５年，这个比例将下降到４０％左右，要下降１３个百分点。预计２０１５年总人口为１３．８亿，劳动供给人口为５．６亿。以后，由于本世纪后３０年代出生率持续下降，劳动供给人口还会进一步减少。
    ２０１５年前后，建国后出生的人口陆续退出劳动年龄，每年约２０００万，而接替的年轻劳动者每年只有１０００多万，有的年份可能不足１０００万，劳动年龄人口中高龄者的比重必然上升。
    劳动力人数减少和劳动年龄人口中高龄人增加，首先对国民经济的发展将会产生不利的影响，扩大生产和开辟新产业会遇到劳动资源短缺问题。其次会影响每年兵源的补充，不利于加强国防建设。
    前几年，国内学术界对未来人口老龄化和随之而来的劳动力相对短缺问题有不同看法。有一种意见认为，２１世纪科技发展，劳动生产率提高，技术密集型产业增多，对劳动力的需求减少，劳动供给问题不足为虑。
    不可否认，随着科学技术的发展，一些产业部门需要的劳动力可用技术替代。然而也要看到，科学技术的发展必然导致新行业的开辟。新行业对劳动力又必然产生新的需求。从社会发展的趋势看，劳动生产力的提高和科技的进步总是扩大社会需求和刺激生产，从而开辟新的行业，增加就业。蒸汽机的发明使纺纱厂排斥了千万架手摇纺车，但同时却开创了整个工业时代，吸纳了亿万劳动力。所以，我们不可以认为，生产力提高、科技发展就不会发生劳动力供给不足问题。
    面对２１世纪我国将出现的劳动人口高龄化，有以下问题需要研究解决。
    第一，坚持和改进计划生育工作。计划生育的目标不仅是控制人口增长，而且应是调节出生率，使每年成长的劳动力比较均衡。控制人口出生时间有可能使每年达到劳动年龄的人数不致过于集中，避免劳动就业紧张和劳动资源短缺交替出现的局面。
    第二，提高劳动力素质以弥补数量之不足。到２１世纪，随着２０００年战略目标的实现，劳动力素质将大为提高。身体素质方面，由于食物结构改变，生活环境、劳动条件改善，劳动时间缩短，劳动保护、医疗卫生和保健设施增加，人口体魄将大大增强。２１世纪我国人口的文化素质也会有很大的提高。中小学教育普及，职业教育发展，使人们的文化科学知识和职业技能增强。高等教育的发展，将培养造就出大批掌握现代先进科学技术的专业人员、工程师和管理人才。
    提高劳动力素质的关键在于教育。为了２１世纪国民经济各部门、各行业能够获得足够的才德兼备、体魄强健的优良的劳动者，从现在起就必须下大力改进教育工作。应增加教育经费，改革教育体制。除改革教育方法，改进教学内容，办好各级各类学校外，还要实行开放政策，提倡和鼓励社会集资办学、民主党派办学和私人办学，以弥补国家教育经费之不足。要切实提高教师的社会地位，增加教师的工资待遇，以此鼓励更多的人从事教育事业。
    第三，可考虑延长劳动年限，推迟退休。我国现行退休制度还是５０年代规定的，男性６０岁、女性５５岁退休，企业中体力劳动者各提前５年。３０多年过去，情况已经变化，规定却没有改。特别自８０年代以来，退休年龄后延的可能性已经出现。近几年，许多专家、技术人员离退休后原单位又聘回去，一大批退休科技人员和技工到集体和乡镇企业发挥了重要的作用；另一方面，更多的干部、职工６０岁身体仍很健康，退休后无所事事，情绪低沉，加速了他们身心的衰老。事实表明，现行的退休年龄可以后延。２１世纪，人口身体素质比现在要好，退休年龄后延五年是完全可能的。
    第四，充分利用劳动资源。半个世纪以来，直到现在，我国还是一个劳动力接近无限供给的国家。由于种种原因，劳动力浪费严重，特别是“人才浪费”惊人。这种状况必须改变。
    从长远看，要使多余的农业劳动者充实到非农产业各领域中去发挥作用。近几年农业劳动力已经转移出几千万。流动已经开始，城乡壁垒初步冲破。但是，目前有关劳动力流动的一些理论问题和实际问题还没有取得一致意见。
    当前要坚决改变人浮于事浪费劳动资源的状况。我国国营企业多余人员估计为职工总数的１５％——２０％，约２０００万左右，目前各地采取“优化劳动组合”办法，实行“厂内失业”，从不承认有失业到承认失业，变隐蔽失业为公开失业，是一个进步，有助于改变社会主义国家没有失业这个传统观念。但是，冗员裁减之后留在企业内由企业自己消化的办法，恐怕不是长久之计，也不能彻底解决问题。应当让多余人员走向社会，同社会上的失业人员、流入城市尚未找到工作的农民等等形成劳动市场，在平等竞争的条件下，寻求与生产资料的最佳结合。
