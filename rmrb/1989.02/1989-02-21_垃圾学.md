    Garbology, as a social issue, is becoming increasingly acute in many countries. At the same time, a new field of study—garbology—is gaining attention from scholars in an increasing number of countries. Industrialized nations have specialists and experts dedicated to the study of garbage.

    Experts believe that garbage can reflect a country's consumption level and lifestyle. Dr. Famo from the United States, after studying nearly 20 countries and thousands of garbage dumps, presented his views: Those who do not understand how to handle and utilize garbage, and regard it as waste, belong to primitive tribes, with an average income per person of less than $50. Countries with high production levels, which view garbage as a treasure and know how to utilize it, are advanced nations. They no longer see garbage as a burden but as an asset.

　　垃圾学
    垃圾作为一个社会问题，正日益尖锐地摆在各国面前。与此同时，一门新兴的学问——垃圾学正被愈来愈多国家的学者所重视，工业发达国家都有专门的博士和专家从事垃圾研究。
    专家们认为，垃圾能反映出一个国家的消费水平和生活方式。美国的法莫博士曾考察近２０个国家的上千个垃圾山，提出了自己的见解：不懂得垃圾的处理和利用，视垃圾为废物的人们属于原始民族，人平均收入低于５０美元；生产水平高、视垃圾为宝，且懂得利用，这类属先进国家，它们把垃圾不再当作负担而是资产了。
