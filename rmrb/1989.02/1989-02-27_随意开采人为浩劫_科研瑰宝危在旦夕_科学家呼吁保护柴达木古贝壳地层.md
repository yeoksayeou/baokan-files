	Random Mining Threatens Catastrophe; Scientific Treasures in Peril
	Scientists Urge Protection of Qaidam Ancient Shell Strata

	XINING, Feb. 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have called for urgent measures to stop the destruction of the ancient shell fossil strata in the Qaidam Basin, a rare natural wonder.

	In the central part of the Qaidam Basin, near the Nur River, there is a series of low hills stretching for several kilometers. One end of the hills, exposed by flood erosion, reveals a cliff that uncovers a secret: beneath a thin layer of soil lies a thick layer of fossilized shells of bivalves and gastropods, reaching a depth of over 20 meters. Experts have identified this rare natural phenomenon as the largest Quaternary biological stratum discovered so far in China's inland basins, dating back over 34,000 years. It is a valuable geological record for studying the climate changes, salt lake evolution, and future climate trends in the Qaidam Basin, as well as in other inland basins like the Tarim and Junggar.

	However, this precious biological stratum is now facing a man-made catastrophe. It is understood that nearby units and individuals are randomly mining the fossilized shells, crushing and processing them into feed additives, which are sold openly at 70 yuan per ton. Some state farms are also planning to use the fossilized shells to produce lime, and a feed company in the province is considering large-scale development and utilization of this natural calcium resource, having already conducted feasibility studies.

	The precious ancient biological stratum is in imminent danger, and some geologists and environmental scientists in Qinghai Province are extremely concerned. Zhu Juncai, Chief Engineer of the Qinghai Provincial Geological and Mineral Resources Development Service Department, told reporters, "The ancient shell strata are a scientific treasure with extremely limited reserves. If mining continues, it will be depleted in just a few years. Such a precious biological stratum is about to be destroyed, which is truly heartbreaking!"

	To preserve historical records for future research on Qaidam, scientists have appealed to relevant departments: quickly seal off the area, establish a protected zone for the ancient biological strata, and promptly organize experts to conduct on-site investigations to determine the level and scope of protection.

　　随意开采人为浩劫　科研瑰宝危在旦夕
    科学家呼吁保护柴达木古贝壳地层
    新华社西宁电  （记者王宏伟）我国科学工作者建议采取紧急措施制止对柴达木盆地古贝壳化石地层的破坏，保护这一罕见的古生物化石遗存。
    在我国柴达木盆地中部的努尔河附近，有一道绵延数公里的小丘陵，丘陵一端由于洪水冲刷而出现的一处断壁，揭开了丘陵下面的秘密：薄薄的土层下，竟有厚达２０多米的瓣鳃类和腹足类生物贝壳化石堆积层。经有关部门鉴定，这一罕见的自然奇观，是迄今为止我国内陆盆地发现的最大规模的第四纪生物地层，距今已有３４０００多年历史，它是研究柴达木盆地以及塔里木、准噶尔等内陆盆地数万年以来的气候变迁、盐湖演变乃至预测今后气候变迁趋势的宝贵地质历史资料。
    但是，这一宝贵的古生物地层正面临一场人为的浩劫。据了解，附近的一些单位和个人在这里随意开采贝壳化石，粉碎加工后作为饲料添加剂以每吨７０元的价格公开出售，一些国营农场还准备用贝壳化石烧制石灰，省内一家饲料公司也将其视为天然钙资源，准备大规模开发利用，并已进行了可行性研究。
    宝贵的古生物地层危在旦夕，青海省一些地质、环境科学工作者对此心急如焚。青海省地质矿产技术开发服务部总工程师朱俊才对记者说：“古贝壳地层堪称科研瑰宝，储量极其有限，如果任其开采，不过几年将开采殆尽。如此珍贵的生物地层，即将遭到毁灭性的破坏，实在令人痛心！”
    为了给科研部门和后人研究柴达木留下历史资料，科学工作者纷纷向有关部门发出呼吁：尽快封闭这一地区，建立古生物地层保护区，并尽快组织有关专家赴现场进行实地考查，以便确定保护等级和保护范围。
