When the chimes of the Year of the Snake rang out on the television, the soldiers at the Wulasitai Border Defense Station on the northwestern border of the motherland cheered and jumped in the snow at minus 30 degrees Celsius. This is because they were celebrating the Spring Festival with a Uyghur general.

As the firecrackers faded, the deputy political commissar of the Xinjiang Military Region, Major General Wulateyefu, cupped his hands and greeted them in the Han Chinese manner. Immediately, shouts of "Good evening, Commander!" "Good evening, comrades!" "Long live the motherland!" echoed through the mountains.

Major General Wulateyefu always likes to spend holidays with the soldiers. On the afternoon of New Year's Eve of the Year of the Dragon, as soon as he arrived at the border defense station, he climbed the 178-step observation tower to visit the soldiers on duty. On New Year's Eve, the general watched the Spring Festival Gala on CCTV with the soldiers.

Soldier Liang Yucai was very happy. He boasted everywhere that he had played poker with Major General Wulateyefu for two hours. He said he always lost, and the general always won. He crawled under the table three times, making the general laugh heartily.

　　维吾尔族将军春节在边卡
　　杜献洲
    当电视机中传来蛇年的钟声时，位于祖国西北边境线上的乌拉斯台边防站，几十名战士在零下３０℃的雪野中欢呼跳跃。因为他们同一位维吾尔族的将军过春节。
    爆竹声刚过，新疆军区副政委乌拉太也夫少将抱拳，用汉族礼节向他们拜年。顿时，一声声“首长好！”“同志们好！”“祖国好！”在群山中回荡。
    乌拉太也夫少将每逢过节，总喜欢和战士们在一起。龙年除夕下午，他一到边防站，就蹬上砌有１７８级台阶的瞭望塔，看望执勤的战士。除夕之夜来临，将军和战士们在一起观看中央电视台的春节联欢晚会节目。
    战士梁玉才十分高兴，他到处炫耀自己和乌拉太也夫少将打了两个小时扑克。他说他总是输，将军总是赢，他钻了三次桌子，惹得将军哈哈大笑。
