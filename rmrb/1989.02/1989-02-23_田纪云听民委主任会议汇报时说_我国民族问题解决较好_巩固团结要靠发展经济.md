Vice Premier Tian Jiyun, today in the afternoon, listened to the report of the National Conference of Directors of the State Commission of Nationalities in Zhongnanhai. He said that our country's ethnic issues are relatively well-solved in the world, and the Chinese nation is a united nation.

Tian Jiyun pointed out that this is because the Party Central Committee has always attached great importance to ethnic issues. Since liberation, ethnic work has always been on the agenda of the Party Central Committee and the Central Government. Our country's Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy and ethnic policies are popular, not only written on paper but also implemented in action.

Tian Jiyun said that reform and opening up have brought significant development to China's coastal regions and accelerated the development of ethnic minority regions, with people's lives generally improved. Of course, the current development speed of ethnic minority regions still lags behind that of coastal regions.

Tian Jiyun also pointed out that consolidating the unity of all ethnic peoples is most importantly to promote the economic development of ethnic minority regions. First, we must leverage the resource advantages of ethnic minority regions, enhance their own competitiveness, which is the fundamental way to promote the development of ethnic minority regions. In developing the economy of ethnic minority regions, we should advocate for "East-West cooperation," utilizing the resources of ethnic minority regions to attract funds, talents, and technologies from eastern regions, and transforming the resource advantages of ethnic minority regions into product advantages, thereby promoting the common development of the east and west. Tian Jiyun said that in the process of reform and opening up, we should vigorously develop local trade and border trade. Currently, local trade and border trade in some places like Heilongjiang, Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Tibet, and Yunnan have seen significant development. Practice has proven that this path is successful.

State Councilor Chen Junsheng also spoke.

　　田纪云听民委主任会议汇报时说
    我国民族问题解决较好  巩固团结要靠发展经济
    据新华社北京２月２２日电  （记者孙勇）国务院副总理田纪云今天下午在中南海听取全国民委主任会议汇报时说，我们国家的民族问题在世界上是解决得比较好的，中华民族是一个团结的民族。
    田纪云指出，这是由于党中央对民族问题一向十分重视，解放以来民族工作一直列入党中央和中央政府的议事日程。我们国家的民族区域自治法和民族政策是得人心的，不仅写在纸上，而且落实在行动上。
    田纪云说，改革开放使我国沿海地区有了很大发展，也加速了少数民族地区的发展，人民生活普遍有所改善。当然，目前我国少数民族地区的发展速度还赶不上沿海地区发展。
    田纪云还指出，巩固各族人民的大团结，最重要的是促进少数民族地区经济的发展。首先要发挥少数民族地区资源优势，增强自身的竞争能力，这是促进少数民族地区发展的根本出路。在发展少数民族地区经济中要提倡“东西联合”，利用少数民族地区的资源吸引东部地区的资金、人才、技术，并使少数民族地区的资源优势变成产品优势，以此促进东西部共同发展。田纪云说，在改革开放中要大力发展地方贸易和边境贸易。目前黑龙江、新疆、内蒙古、西藏、云南一些地方的地方贸易和边境贸易有很大发展。实践证明，这条路是成功的。
    国务委员陈俊生也讲了话。
