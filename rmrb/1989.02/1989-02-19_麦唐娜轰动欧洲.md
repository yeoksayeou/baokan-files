	Madonna Sways Europe
	Hong Shannan

	The tour performances of American pop star Madonna in Europe have caused a great sensation, especially in London and Frankfurt, where her concerts have left countless audiences captivated.

	The *West Berlin Morning Post* reported: "Madonna, this 29-year-old superstar, caused 340 British fans to faint during her London concert. Due to the over-excited atmosphere in the performance hall, 77,000 spectators had to use water to cool down. When Madonna took off her red outer pants during her performance, the male fans went crazy and threw their pants onto the stage. This star has a powerful voice that could be heard throughout the entire Wembley area of London. To prevent Madonna from being 'suddenly attacked' by fans, all scheduled visits and tours were canceled."

	In 1987, Madonna held 17 concerts in the United States, attracting over a million spectators. When she visited Europe, she brought along a team of 50 people, including 7 famous musicians, 6 dancers, and 3 backup singers. Before Madonna's visit to West Germany, various local newspapers published numerous advertisements and reviews, extensively promoting her. The Federal Railway Company of Germany also sold special discounted tickets for traveling by train from other cities to Frankfurt to watch the concert, resulting in the sale of 60,000 tickets. On the day of the performance, a scene similar to London's occurred. During the concert, about 30 people fainted and were carried out of the performance hall by the emergency team. The frenzied atmosphere surpassed that of any other pop star's concert in recent years.

	Madonna's earnings from her Frankfurt concert broke the record for any singer in the Federal Republic of Germany. She earned 10 million marks from a single concert, and her agent's earnings exceeded 3.5 million marks (that day, there were 60,000 spectators, and each ticket cost 45 marks). Her fame is so high, and the welcome she received was so fervent, reportedly due to her involvement in films. Her starring role in the film *Desperately Seeking Susan* was highly acclaimed in West Germany and received enthusiastic praise from the audience.

　　麦唐娜轰动欧洲
    洪善楠
    美国流行歌星麦唐娜在欧洲的旅行演出引起极大的轰动，特别是在伦敦和法兰克福的音乐会上，使无数的观众为之倾倒。
    《西柏林晨邮报》报道：“麦唐娜，这位２９岁的超级歌星，在伦敦的音乐会上，竟使英国的３４０名歌迷当场晕倒”，“由于音乐演奏场气氛过分热烈，７７０００名观众不得不用水来冲洗一下。当麦唐娜在演唱中把红色的外裤脱去时，男观众中间的歌迷们疯狂了，他们也把裤子脱下来抛到舞台上去”，“这位歌星声音宏亮，在伦敦的整个温勃雷城区都可以听到她的声音。为使麦唐娜免遭歌迷们的‘突然袭击’，原来安排的参观访问计划全部取消。”
    麦唐娜１９８７年在美国共举行过１７场音乐会，赢得观众１００多万人。她出访欧洲时携带５０人，其中著名者有７个音乐家、６个舞蹈演员、３个伴唱者。麦唐娜访问西德以前，西德各地报刊就刊登了大量广告和评介文章，广泛为其宣传。联邦德国的铁路公司还推销一种从外地坐火车到法兰克福观看音乐会的优惠票，结果使６万张入场券销售一空。在演出当天，同样出现了伦敦那样的热烈场面。在音乐会上，当场约有３０人晕倒，被急救队抬出音乐演奏场。狂热的气氛超过了近年来任何流行歌星的音乐会。
    麦唐娜在法兰克福音乐会上的收入打破了联邦德国任何歌星的纪录。她一场音乐会收入１００万马克，经纪人的收入也超过了３５万马克（当天观众６万人，每张门票４５马克）。她的知名度如此之高，引起如此狂热的欢迎，据说与她兼演电影有关。她主演的影片《苏珊》曾蜚声西德影坛，受到观众的热烈欢迎。
