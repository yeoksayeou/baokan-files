The preparation for the Shanghai–Paris World Song Contest, which was supposed to be held in June this year, has encountered difficulties. According to a report from the *China Music Newspaper*, the contest, sponsored by a French citizen of Chinese descent and organized by the Shanghai Writers' Association, is currently facing obstacles.

The contest, originally scheduled to be held in June this year in Shanghai, is a popular song creation and selection activity sponsored by a French citizen of Chinese descent and organized by the Shanghai Writers' Association. During the negotiations last year, the sponsor was willing to provide one million US dollars. Without thoroughly discussing the details and conditions, both parties hastily signed the agreement. Subsequently, through various major newspapers, the Shanghai Writers' Association began the large-scale collection and selection of songs, for which nearly 100,000 yuan had already been advanced. Recently, during the process of signing the formal contract, the sponsor's agent proposed that the performers at the award-winning song performance in June must be internationally recognized stars; otherwise, the sponsor would not provide the sponsorship. Faced with this condition, the Shanghai Writers' Association is in a difficult position. On the one hand, the high fees for multiple international superstars to perform in Shanghai would not be covered by the one million US dollars; on the other hand, foreign singers who are accustomed to composing and performing their own songs may not be willing to perform works by Chinese musicians. Even if these problems are solved, it is difficult to predict whether those singers, who are often tied up with performance contracts, will accept the invitation to come to Shanghai on time. Additionally, the stage image of those singers, who are accustomed to wild and unrestrained performances, may not be in line with Chinese national conditions, and the organizers have deep concerns about this. Therefore, the Shanghai Writers' Association had requested the sponsor's agent to discuss the matter again on January 15, but the agent did not respond to the invitation. Faced with this situation, legal experts in Shanghai believe that the agreement signed by the Shanghai Writers' Association is obviously not careful. It neither investigated the details nor proposed the basic premise of adapting to Chinese actual national conditions, and therefore lacks legal binding force.

To ensure that the Shanghai–Paris World Song Contest is held on schedule, relevant parties in Shanghai are making unremitting efforts. However, this incident itself is enough to remind those who are already engaged in, or preparing for, foreign cultural preparation activities: without fully understanding the specific conditions and requirements of the other party, one must not be blinded by greed; otherwise, one may end up with the result of "losing both the wife and the soldiers"!

　　签协议不慎重苦果难吞
    上海—巴黎世界歌赛筹备陷入困境
    本报讯  据《中国音乐报》报道：正在紧锣密鼓筹备中的上海—巴黎世界歌唱比赛目前陷入困境。
    这次原定今年６月于上海举行的比赛，系由一法籍华人赞助、上海文联具体筹办的通俗歌曲创作评选活动。在去年洽谈时，赞助者愿为此提供一百万美元。在没有深入商谈细节、条件的情况下，双方匆匆签署了协议。之后通过各大报纸，上海文联大张旗鼓地开始了歌曲的征集评选工作，为此已预支了近十万元人民币。最近在签订正式合同的过程中，赞助者代理人提出：于６月份举行的得奖歌曲演唱会上，演唱者必须是世界公认歌星，否则赞助者将不予赞助。面对这一条件，上海文联进退两难。一虑多位国际超级名星来沪演唱的高额费用，仅靠一百万美金入不敷出；二是习惯于自己作曲、自己演唱的国外歌星是否愿意演唱中国音乐家的作品。上述问题即便解决，那些被频繁的演出合同缠身的歌星能否接受邀请如约来上海也难以预料。此外对那些惯于狂歌纵姿的歌星的舞台形象，会不会有违于中国国情，主办者更深表忧虑。为此上海文联曾要求赞助者的代理人于１月１５日再次进行商洽，代理人却未能应邀面谈。面对这一情况，上海法律界人士认为：上海文联签署的协议显然是不慎重的，它既没有探究细节，又没提出必须适合中国实际国情的起码前提，因此难以具备法律的约束力。
    为了上海—巴黎世界歌唱比赛如期举行，上海有关方面正在进行不懈的努力。可是这一事情本身足以提醒那些已在进行、或准备进行涉外文化筹备活动的人士：在没有充分了解外方具体条件和要求的情况下，千万不要利令智昏，不然很可能导致“赔了夫人又折兵”的后果！
