The troubles of sanitation workers

The Huangzhou Town Environmental Sanitation Management Office in Huanggang County has 98 staff members responsible for cleaning the streets covering an area of 148,000 square meters and 286 toilets. The office spends 250,000 yuan annually, of which only 100,000 yuan is allocated by higher authorities, with the rest coming from selling manure and collecting sanitation fees. To collect these fees, they often have to visit various units multiple times. Recently, to collect sanitation fees from a single unit, they had to visit 22 times.

According to urban management requirements, sanitation workers should be allocated at a rate of 0.2% of the total urban population, and each worker should be responsible for cleaning 5,000 square meters of secondary roads. However, the current situation in Huangzhou Town is that there are half as many sanitation workers as needed, and many of them are overworked. Additionally, due to financial constraints, necessary sanitation equipment cannot be purchased. Currently, the entire town of Huangzhou has only one old water sprinkler truck and a few outdated hand-pulled tractors and mechanical dump trucks. In 1988, the office removed 26,000 tons of garbage and 14,000 tons of manure, all of which were transported out using carts and hand-pulled tractors.

In Huangzhou Town, spitting on the ground, throwing fruit peels, and dumping garbage randomly are common sights, with no regulations to control them. Several main streets had 40 fruit peel bins installed in 1987. However, these bins were either stolen or damaged, and the Environmental Sanitation Office had to retrieve them all.

Huangzhou Town is an ancient city and the location of the Huanggang Municipal Committee and Administrative Office. It is hoped that relevant departments will genuinely address the troubles of sanitation workers.

### 清洁工人的苦恼

　　清洁工人的苦恼
    黄冈县黄州镇环境卫生管理所有九十八名职工，担负着黄州十四万八千平方米面积的街道和二百八十六座厕所的清扫工作。这个所每年需开支二十五万元，除上级有一万元拨款外，其余均靠卖大粪、收取卫生费维持。为收取卫生费，他们经常讨东家，要西家。前不久，为收一个单位的卫生费，竟上门二十二次。
    按城市管理要求，清洁工人应按城区总人口的千分之二配备，二级路面每人清扫面积五千平方米。可黄州镇目前的状况是，清洁工人差一半，不少清洁工人超负荷工作。况且，由于资金紧缺，一些必要的环卫设备无法添置，偌大个黄州镇，目前只有一辆旧洒水车和几台陈旧的手扶拖拉机、机械翻斗车。一九八八年，这个所清除的二万六千吨垃圾、一万四千吨粪便，全部是靠板车和手扶拖拉机送出去的。
    在黄州镇，随地吐痰、乱扔果皮、乱倒垃圾已是司空见惯，也无章约束。几条主要街道曾于一九八七年安放了四十个果皮箱。没过多久，这些果皮箱有的被人偷走，有的已损坏，环管所只好全部收回。
    黄州镇是一座古城，又是黄冈地委、行署所在地。希望有关部门切实解决清洁工人的苦恼。
