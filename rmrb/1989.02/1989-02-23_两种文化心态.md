Title: Two Cultural Mentalities

People's cultural mentalities are diverse, but they can be broadly categorized into two types: entrepreneurial and conservative. The entrepreneurial type is characterized by dissatisfaction with the status quo, daring to surpass, and valuing creation. The conservative type is characterized by self-satisfaction, respect for ancestral rules, and emphasis on inheritance.

The European bourgeoisie, in its early stages of capital accumulation, particularly during the Renaissance, was ambitious and full of initiative. Engels, describing the era's vitality, wrote: "This was an age that needed giants, and it produced giants." These giants—the humanist advocates of individuality—were extraordinary in their thinking, passion, character, versatility, and profound learning. They shouldered the historical mission of the rising bourgeoisie and demonstrated pioneering and creative spirits in all aspects. Although they claimed to take ancient Greek and Roman cultures as models, they were not passive in their worship or simple in their inheritance; rather, they surpassed them in a comprehensive manner. Notably, this characteristic has not disappeared to this day. Look, in the 19th century, when realism reached such a glorious peak, they still carried out such large-scale rebellions and surpasses, driving out so many new artistic genres and creating so many new artistic forms, thus making the traditional river flow into the 20th century more magnificent.

Europeans also had periods of humiliation and weakness, particularly during the long and dark Middle Ages. During this period, our Chinese nation experienced prosperity from the Han to the Tang dynasties, showcasing high wisdom and creative vitality. However, perhaps fate was playing a balancing game: just as Europe rose from the stagnation of the Middle Ages, full of energy, creating modern civilization, and offering batches of "giants" to humanity, China began to falter and decline! Was it that the Chinese had exhausted their wisdom and energy? Of course not. Among the many factors that caused the modern reversal of East-West development, the difference in cultural mentalities is an important factor that cannot be ignored.

The Renaissance marked the beginning of capitalism as a new historical era, although it was still in its early stages. As a new force, it had great attacking and destructive power against the beginning of decaying feudalism. However, from the mid-Ming Dynasty onwards, Chinese feudalism, though in decline, still had a crushing advantage over the budding capitalism. Thus, in the same historical period, two societies with different trajectories produced two different results in national cultural psychology: due to the competitive nature of capitalist development, the overall competitive mechanism of society imprinted on national cultural psychology is the consciousness of creation and transcendence. The defensive Chinese feudal society, on the other hand, particularly emphasized strengthening its authoritarian tradition, emphasizing obedience and unity, and requiring traditional norms and stability. Thus, the doctrine of "Heaven does not change, and the Way does not change" and the principle of "Do not look at what is not proper, do not listen to what is not proper, do not speak what is not proper" remained the golden rules. I believe that perhaps only in China could Confucius have such honor: enduring 77 generations, each generation is revered as the "Supreme Sage" and "Teacher of the Ages"; and only in China could the people have such happiness: 2,500 years ago, human truth was exhausted by a "sage," and the brains of millions of commoners no longer need to think. No wonder idol worship, such religious fervor, is so difficult to eradicate here. Similarly, it is not surprising that we have so many things that have remained unchanged for a thousand years or are not allowed to change, such as: our wooden architectural forms and styles have remained basically unchanged for two thousand years, while European wooden architectural forms have undergone multiple distinct styles in the same period; in music, our pentatonic scale has remained largely the same for many years, while others have long expanded their heptatonic scale to 12 tones; our traditional Chinese painting and our opera are both quite old, but their changes are not obvious. For example, certain theoretical concepts, until the 1980s, our art theory textbooks still only mentioned realism and romanticism when discussing creative methods, unaware that these two creative methods could no longer encompass the new phenomena of 20th-century literature and art! Such regrettable phenomena cannot be attributed to the lack of creative thinking and competitive consciousness in our cultural mentality. The famous Chinese philosopher and scholar Yan Fu once compared the cultural mentalities of China and the West, believing that Westerners value "creation," while Chinese value "inheritance," which is indeed to the point.

Of course, human efforts to communicate with each other have not slackened, and China will not be permanently isolated from the tide of the times. Over the past century, from the Reform Movement, the May Fourth Movement to the recent decade of openness, more and more Chinese people have seen the charm of the "blue sky." The two cultural mentalities of East and West are colliding, and the two cultural mentalities of compatriots are rubbing against each other; collisions and frictions are inevitably uncomfortable. But when our grandparents were asked to cut off their queues and our grandmothers to abandon their bound feet, were they not also tearful?

　　两种文化心态
    叶廷芳
    人们的文化心态是千差万别的，但归纳起来不外乎这样两大类：创业型的和守业型的。创业型的特点是不满足现状，敢于超越，重视创造；守业型的特点是自满自足，尊重祖规，强调承袭。
    以新兴资产阶级为主体的欧洲人，在其资本积累的早期，即文艺复兴时期，是雄心勃勃，充满进取精神的。恩格斯在描绘这时期的时代朝气时写道：“这是个需要巨人，而且产生了巨人的时代。”这些巨人——那些倡扬个性的人文主义者“在思维能力、热情和性格方面，在多才多艺和学识渊博方面”都是非凡的。他们担当着上升资产阶级的历史使命，在各方面都表现出开拓精神和创造精神。他们虽然也宣称以古希腊罗马文化为典范，但事实上他们绝不是消极的膜拜和简单的继承，而是总体性的超越。值得注意的是这种特征至今仍然没有消失。你看，在十九世纪的现实主义达到如此辉煌的高峰时，他们还进行这样大规模的反叛和超越，催动出那么多的文艺流派，创造出那么多的文艺新品种，从而使传统的长河流到２０世纪更显得波澜壮阔。
    欧洲人也有过卑屈和窝囊的时期，那就是漫长而黑暗的中世纪。而这时期我们中华民族恰恰经历了从汉到唐的繁荣，显示了高度智慧和创造活力。但也许造化在有意搞“平衡”的游戏：正当欧洲从中世纪的萎顿中奋起，精力充沛地创造着现代文明，向人类奉献成批“巨人”的时候，我们中国却从此步履蹒跚，开始衰落了！是中国人智慧枯竭精力耗尽了吗？当然不是。造成近代中西发展逆反现象的诸多因素中，两种文化心态的不同是一个不可忽视的因素。
    文艺复兴运动标志着资本主义作为一个新的历史时代开始了自己的征程，虽然还只是处于起步阶段，但作为新生力量，它对于开始腐朽的封建主义势力具有很大的攻击力和杀伤力。然而明代中期以后的中国封建主义虽开始衰落，但对于资本主义萌芽仍具有压倒的优势。于是，处于相同历史时期的两种不同走向的社会，在国民的文化心理上产生了两种不同的结果：由于资本主义的发展是以竞争为特征的，社会总体上的竞争机制打在国民文化心理上的烙印是创造意识和超越意识。而处于守势的中国封建社会则特别注重强化其专制主义的传统机制，强调服从与统一，要求传统规范与稳定。于是，所谓“天不变，道亦不变”的信条，所谓“非礼勿视，非礼勿听，非礼勿言”的准则依然是金科玉律。我相信，恐怕只有中国才有孔夫子这样的荣幸：历经７７代，代代被奉为“至圣先师”、“万世师表”；也只有中国才有子民们的这种幸福：早在２５００年前，人间真理就被一位“圣人”穷尽了，亿万小民的大脑可以再也不用思考。无怪乎，偶像崇拜那样的宗教狂热在我们这里如此难以消除。同样也不奇怪，我们眼前会有那么多千年不变或不许变的东西，例如：我们的木构建筑形式风格上两千年来基本不变，而欧洲的木构建筑形式在相同时间里更新了多种互相迥异的风格；音乐中我们的五声音阶多少年来大体如故，而别人早已把他们的七声音阶扩大到１２声；我们的国画和我们的戏曲年岁都不小了，但它们的变化也不明显。再如某些理论概念，直到８０年代出版的我们的文艺理论教科书在提到创作方法的时候，仍只提现实主义和浪漫主义，殊不知这两种创作方法早已概括不了２０世纪文学艺术发展的新现象！这种种令人遗憾的现象还不能不归因于我们的文化心态缺乏一种创造性思维和竞争意识。我国著名哲学思想家和学者严复曾对中西文化心态作了比较，认为西方人重“创造”，中国人重“承袭”，可谓切中肯綮。
    当然，人类寻求互相沟通的努力并没有松懈，中国终究不可能永远隔绝于时代潮流之外。一个世纪以来，从维新运动、“五四”运动到最近开放的１０年，越来越多的中国人看到“蔚蓝色”的魁力，中西之间的两种文化心态在相撞，同胞间的两种文化心态在磨擦；相撞和磨擦难免不好受。但当年要我们的爷爷剪掉辫子，要我们的奶奶抛弃“金莲”的时候，他们不也是泪眼汪汪的吗？
