In recent years, the phenomenon of absenteeism in various adult education schools has been quite shocking. For example, in a certain evening university's economics and management major with 150 students, there are often only 30 or so attending classes. Generally speaking, the average absentee rate is more than 1/3.

However, the pass rate of these students is also surprisingly high! According to estimates from a certain evening university, out of nearly a thousand students, the average number of students who need to retake exams each semester is less than 1%.

There is no diligent study beforehand, but there is passing the exams afterward. Summarizing the reasons, there are a few key factors at play:

First, psychological warfare. Before exams, there are always eloquent individuals who appeal to the teachers' emotions and sympathy. Once the teachers' compassion is aroused, they will inevitably provide some "concessions" during review sessions and when setting exam questions.

Second, forming "exam companies." A few years ago, in a certain evening university's Chinese literature department, there was a young part-time writer who could accurately record the content of the teachers' lectures. His original notes were copied and distributed, so everyone had a copy of the "class notes" without even attending classes. When it came time to review for exams, these self-organized "companies" would divide tasks, with some compiling and copying relevant materials. For liberal arts, they could print and distribute review materials for free. For sciences, they could copy and provide reference solutions. Eventually, this led to an interesting situation: the grading teachers became suspicious of identical answers on exam papers: "Is this plagiarism?" Conversely, the students began to doubt the teachers' fairness: "I studied with XX, why is he 'excellent' and I am 'average'?"

In adult education institutions, such "exam companies" have become quite common. From this, it is clear that the effectiveness of current adult education is worth studying.

### 业余学习中的“考试公司”

　　业余学习中的“考试公司”
    近年，在各类成人学校的教室中，缺勤现象之严重，令人惊讶。某夜大学经济管理专业１５０人，经常只有３０多人在听讲。就一般而言，平均缺勤率为１／３以上。
    然而学员们的学习合格率之高，也令人惊讶！据某夜大学估算，近千名学员每学期课程平均补考人数不会超过１％。
    没有认真读书在前，却有通过考试在后，总结下来，有这样几条原因在起作用：　　
    一、打心理战。考试之前，总有能言善辩之士，对出卷教师诉之以苦，动之以情。教师的恻隐之心一生，则必会在复习辅导时，出考题时，均有所“优惠”。二、组织“考试公司”。前两年，某夜大学中文系有一位青年业余作家，能把教师上课的内容八九不离十记录下来。他的这本原始笔记本在复印机上一变二，一变三……于是大家不来上课，却都“上课笔记”人手一册。到了复习迎考时，这些自发的“公司”则分配人力，分头编写复印有关资料。文科可以把复习内容印发出来，免费分发，理科可以把解题步骤复印出来，提供参考。最后竟然出现了这种趣事：阅卷教师对答案相同的试卷产生了怀疑：“是不是抄袭的？”反过来，学生则对教师的公正性大为怀疑：我和×××一起复习，他为什么是“良”，我是“中”？
    在成人高校中，这种“考试公司”已十分普及。由此可见，目前成人教育的实效是很值得研究的。
