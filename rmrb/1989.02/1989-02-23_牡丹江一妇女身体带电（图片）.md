A woman in Mudanjiang, Heilongjiang Province, has been discovered to have an electrified body. Her name is Liu Ying, a 36-year-old official from the Haolin County government. Last February, Liu Ying suffered a fall that resulted in a brain injury. On November 16, she began to feel a sense of suffocation throughout her body. When her hand came into contact with another female patient in the same ward, there was a sudden "pop" sound, and the other patient was shocked by an electric current. Hospital electrician Dan Qingyou used a test pen to touch Liu Ying's hand, and the current was clearly detectable. From noon until 9 PM every day, the "voltage" on Liu Ying's body reaches over 100 volts. Liu Ying (pictured left) said that after "discharging" the electricity, she feels much more relaxed and comfortable.

    牡丹江一妇女身体带电
    黑龙江省牡丹江市发现了一位身体带电的妇女，她叫刘颖，是海林县政府的干部，今年36岁。去年2月，刘颖摔伤，造成脑外伤综合症。11月16日，她感到全身憋闷难受。当她的手与同病房的一位女患者接触时，只听“叭”的一声响，对方被电击了一下。医院电工单庆友拿起试电笔触及刘颖的手，电流明显。每天中午至晚上9时前，刘颖身上“电压”高达100伏以上。刘颖（图左）说，放“电”以后，她感到轻松舒服多了。
