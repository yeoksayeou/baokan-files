The New China News Agency Hong Kong Branch held a New Year reception today to welcome the in-Hong Kong members of the National People's Congress and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

The New China News Agency Hong Kong Branch held a reception today to celebrate the New Year with National People's Congress representatives and Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference members based in Hong Kong.

At the reception, New China News Agency Hong Kong Branch Director Xu Jiadun extended New Year greetings to the representatives and members. In his toast, he said that although the representatives and members are based in Hong Kong, they are deeply concerned about China's reform and opening up and the four modernizations. They have not only provided various forms of material support to the mainland but have also actively participated in politics and policy-making, offering many valuable suggestions. The patriotic spirit and practical actions of the representatives and members are always an important driving force for China's progress.

Xu Jiadun said that ensuring the stability and prosperity of Hong Kong is the fundamental starting point and ultimate goal of the Chinese government in resolving the Hong Kong issue. This unshakable policy will be specifically implemented and realized through the drafting and implementation of the Basic Law. Over the years, the representatives and members have done a lot of beneficial work for the stability and prosperity of Hong Kong. Xu Jiadun expressed his belief that the representatives and members will further leverage their influence and role, encouraging people from all walks of life in Hong Kong to actively participate in the consultation and discussion on the Basic Law. Through harmonious, coordinated, and dialogical means, a Basic Law that truly reflects the wishes of the people of Hong Kong and the people of the entire country will be smoothly drafted, contributing to the long-term stability and prosperity of Hong Kong.

Over 200 people attended the reception, including National People's Congress representatives, Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference members, Guangdong Provincial People's Congress representatives, and Political Consultative Conference members from various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions. Vice Chairman of the National Political Consultative Conference Zhao Pujin, who was passing through Hong Kong, also attended the reception.
