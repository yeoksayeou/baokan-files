The key to strengthening democracy and legal system building lies in establishing a mechanism for legal checks and balances on power.

He said, to achieve this goal, the role of the People's Congress should be fully utilized. By establishing systems such as the People's Congress openly supervising the government, the right of interrogation, the system of confidence, and the system of impeachment, the government can be made to govern openly, fairly, and justly. At the same time, organizations such as trade unions, the Communist Youth League, and the Women's Federation should reflect the demands and sentiments of the masses more, participate in supervising the government, and safeguard their own interests.

Duan Suquan believes that major decisions should undergo extensive public opinion polls and investigations, and if necessary, implement national referendums. In the People's Congress, debates should be encouraged, and under the premise of ensuring that the majority exercise their rights, the minority should have the right to express, reserve, and even insist on their own ideas and views.

He pointed out that to implement democracy and the legal system, the state should legally guarantee freedom of speech, encourage speaking the truth, and openly supervise government leaders. Newspapers and radio stations should report both agreed-upon views and differing views.

　　民主法制关键在制衡机制
    段苏权建议人大公开监督政府
    新华社北京２月２０日电  全国人大常委会委员段苏权今天在七届全国人大常委会第六次会议上作大会发言时指出，加强民主和法制建设的关键，在于建立法律对权力的制衡机制。
    他说，为达此目的，应真正发挥人民代表大会的作用，通过建立人大对政府的公开监督制度、质询制度、信任制度、弹劾制度等，促使政府为政公开、公平、公道。与此同时，工会、青年团、妇联等社会团体，应多反映群众的要求和情绪，参与监督政府，维护切身利益。
    段苏权认为，重大决策的出台，应实行广泛的民意测验和调查，必要时实行全民公决。在人大，应提倡辩论，在保证多数人行使权力的前提下，允许少数人有陈述、保留甚至坚持自己的思想和观点的权利。
    他指出，实行民主与法制，国家要依法保障舆论自由，鼓励讲真话，公开监督政府领导人。报纸、电台既要报道相同意见，也要报道不同意见。
