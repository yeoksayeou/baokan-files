The Eleventh Asian Games electronic engineering faces many challenges
The engineering command department holds a mobilization meeting in Beijing

	Beijing, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Despite the fact that there are still more than 500 days until the opening of the Eleventh Asian Games, the builders of the electronic engineering project for the Games already feel the pressure of time. At today's mobilization meeting for the construction of the electronic engineering project for the Eleventh Asian Games, the engineering command department called on all sectors to provide support in terms of financial resources, materials, and manpower. At the meeting, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications immediately expressed its commitment to fully support the Asian Games project.

	Deputy Commander of the Asian Games Electronic Engineering Command Department, Wang Shixiong, introduced the scale of the engineering design at the meeting. The electronic service system is divided into three aspects: communications, broadcasting and television, and computers. The communications project will build 11 information transmission and service systems, and establish a program-controlled telephone exchange with an initial capacity of 8,000 lines. Various types of telephones will be added to the venues, news center, and organizing committee, totaling 1,656 units. The satellite earth station will expand one television uplink line each for the Indian Ocean and Pacific satellites to ensure a 6-transmit-2-receive television system during the Asian Games. At the same time, it will also provide color and black-and-white dual-use photo fax, car phones, wireless paging, and other modern communication services. After the implementation of the computer project, a computer network consisting of medium-sized machines, small-sized machines, more than 50 high-end microcomputers, and more than 600 intelligent terminals will be established, distributed across major venues and news centers.

	Such a massive task, after a year of hard work in 1988, has made significant progress, but currently faces many difficulties. The main issues are insufficient funds and equipment, a large-scale project, and a tight timeline. They believe that 1989 is the decisive year for the project, with no room for retreat. If the entire system cannot be basically completed by the end of this year, there will be significant risks. The engineering command department mobilized all staff at the meeting to work together, seize every minute, and focus on progress and quality to ensure the project is completed on time.

　　第十一届亚运会电子工程面临诸多难题
    工程指挥部在京召开动员大会
    本报北京２月２日讯  记者黄振中报道：尽管距离第十一届亚运会开幕还有５００多天，但亚运会电子工程建设者们已感到时间紧迫。在今天召开的第十一届亚运会电子工程建设动员大会上，工程指挥部呼吁各界从财力、物力、人力等方面给予支援。会上，邮电部当即表态，尽全力支持亚运会工程。
    亚运会电子工程指挥部副总指挥王世雄在会上介绍了工程设计规模。电子服务系统分３个方面：通信、广播电视和计算机。通信工程要建成１１个信息传送及服务系统，建成一个初装容量８０００门的程控电话局。在各个场馆、新闻中心和组委会等地增加各类电话１６５６部。卫星地球站对印度洋和太平洋卫星各扩展一条电视上行线，以保证亚运会期间６发２收的电视系统。同时还要提供彩色、黑白两用相片传真、汽车电话、无线寻呼等现代化通信服务。计算机工程实施之后，将建立一个由中型机、小型机、５０余台高档微机、６００余台智能终端等各种通讯部件组成的计算机网络，分布各大赛场和新闻中心。
    这样艰巨的任务，经过去年一年的艰苦努力，虽然取得较大进展，但目前面临着不少困难。主要是资金、设备不足，工程大、时间紧迫。他们认为１９８９年是工程决战的一年，没有退路。本年内整个系统若还不能基本建成，那么就要担很大的风险。工程指挥部在会上动员全体职工团结协作，争分夺秒，狠抓进度和质量，决战决胜确保工程按期完成。
