	The Last Fallen Leaf (and one more)
	Chen Guangbin

	A page of golden yellow calendar
	Is torn off by the cold autumn wind
	Falls onto the soft grass
	Silent and speechless
	The splendid stories
	Seem to have been forgotten by the migratory birds
	It has not withered
	Even though the honeymoon is over
	The golden veins
	Weave the path of life
	Flowing with transparent memories
	It knows
	Fragrance belongs to the flowers
	Sweetness belongs to the fruits
	It does not need the favor of the seasons
	Only needs a sincere heart
	To write a love letter with the frost of autumn
	Golden, like the clouds at dusk in early spring
	Given to the black soil that once loved
	The earth will deeply treasure
	The fruits of love in its heart

	The Bird of Seasons

	A migratory bird
	In the morning with frost
	With longing and disappointment for the seasons
	Leaves with the autumn wind
	Fly away
	No need to weep for loss
	The sail of fate has risen
	On the long journey
	All worries and anxieties will be shaken off
	I understand you
	Those wings that cut through the wind and mist
	Are for pursuit, not escape
	From the withered polar regions
	No need to hesitate
	Along the unfamiliar landscape
	Seek new balance and contrast

　　最后一片落叶 （外一首）
    陈广斌
    一页金黄色日历
    被冰凉的秋风撕去
    落在松软的草地上
    默默无语
    那些绚丽的故事
    仿佛已经被候鸟忘记
    它没有枯萎
    蜜月虽然已经过去
    金黄色的叶脉
    织成生命的小路
    流动着透明的记忆
    它知道
    芬芳属于花朵
    甜蜜属于果实
    它不需要季节的眷顾
    只需要一缕忠诚的心语
    蘸着秋霜写一封情书
    金黄，如初春黄昏的云霓
    赠给曾经热恋的黑土
    大地将爱的果实
    深深地收藏在心里
    　　　　季节鸟
    一只候鸟
    在落霜的早晨
    带着对季节的眷恋与失望
    随秋风而去
    飞走吧
    不必为失落啜泣
    命运的风帆已经升起
    漫长的旅途中
    会抖掉所有的烦恼与忧虑
    我能理解你
    那双裁风剪雾的翅膀
    是为了追索而不是逃避
    从枯萎的极地出发
    不必犹豫
    沿陌生的风景线
    去寻求新的平衡与对比
