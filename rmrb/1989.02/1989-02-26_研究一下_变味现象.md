	Researching the "Flavor Change Phenomenon"

	Nowadays, people often sigh that reform measures are good in theory, but when it comes to actual implementation, they often go awry and lose their original intent.

	Take competitive contracting, for example. Introducing a competitive mechanism into contracting, and conducting bidding during the contracting process, not only makes the contracting index more reasonable, but also helps discover talents and allows those who are good at management to stand out. However, competitive contracting can also go wrong and lose its original intent. The person in charge of contracting does not choose the best candidate impartially but decides who wins the bid based on personal relationships. Some leaders of contracting units even use so-called "bidding competitions" as a legal means to push out those who do not align with their interests and select those who are more to their liking. Such incidents have occurred in various places. Today, this newspaper publishes the contracting event of Shanxi Yuncheng Chemical Fertilizer Plant as an example.

	The reason why some places' competitive contracting has gone wrong is often due to the intrusion of power and personal gain into the competitive contracting process. On the surface, it is bidding and contracting, but in reality, it is the leaders who decide. Thus, competitive contracting is not based on the contracting regulations but has become a competition of pulling strings and building relationships. Such competition not only fails to improve the enterprise but also fosters unhealthy practices. This situation is highly detrimental to the healthy promotion of the contracting responsibility system. It uses the banner of enterprise reform to tarnish the reputation of the contracting system; it artificially creates many conflicts, affecting the development of enterprise production.

	To prevent such phenomena, the most important thing is to adhere to the principles of fairness, impartiality, and transparency. First, there is fairness. All bidders should start from the same line, compete under the same rules, and fully express their management plans and achievable bids. This is how they should compete, without adding any other conditions for certain individuals.

	Judgment must be impartial. Who wins the bid should not be decided by personal feelings or the biases of certain superiors.

	Transparency is also essential. Transparency is an important condition for ensuring fairness and impartiality. Under public scrutiny, it is more difficult for some people to engage in favoritism and fraud. Therefore, we often judge the degree of fairness and impartiality by the degree of transparency.

	Fairness, impartiality, and transparency are not difficult to achieve. In Liaoning Province, Benxi City, there is a famous "King of Scrap," who gained national recognition. From July 1984 to May 1987, he contracted the Benxi City Material Recycling Company, achieving profits equivalent to the best nine years' total profit in just three years. Later, he achieved new successes and became a labor model in Liaoning Province and Benxi City. At the beginning of this year, the "King of Scrap's" contract expired. In mid-February, the city government publicly recruited a general manager for the Material Recycling Company. Unexpectedly, there was a stronger contender, and the "King of Scrap" lost in the competition. The original manager of the city's Native Products and Building Materials Company, Yin Debao, won the bid. Although many people thought that the "King of Scrap's" past merits should be considered, the city government believed that one should not practice favoritism and must adhere to the principles of fairness, transparency, and selecting the best. Whoever has the stronger ability should be the one to take the position.

	From these examples, we can see that wherever there is personal gain corrupting power, the "flavor change" phenomenon will occur. Adhering to the principles of fairness, impartiality, and especially transparency, is an important measure to prevent the "flavor change." The logic is simple: things are more likely to go bad in the dark. So, let's bring them out into the sunlight.

### 研究一下“变味现象”

　　研究一下“变味现象”
    江畅
    现在经常有人发出这样的感叹：改革措施本来是好的，可是一到实际贯彻执行的时候，往往走了样，变了味儿。
    就说竞争承包吧，把竞争机制引入承包，在承包时进行招标，这不仅可以使承包指数更为合理，而且可以发现人才，使会经营的人才脱颖而出。但是，竞争承包也可能走样，变味，主管发包的人，不是秉公择优，而且凭人情关系决定哪个中标。甚至有的主管单位的领导者，利用所谓的“招标竞争”，以合法的手段把不合自己心意的优者赶下去，把与自己气味相投的劣者选上来。各地都有这样事例发生，今天本报刊登山西运城化肥厂的承包事件，就是一例。
    一些地方的一些竞争承包之所以变味儿，最常见的是权力、私利侵入竞争承包。表面上是招标承包，实际上还是领导人说了算。这样，竞争承包不是依照承包条例的竞争，而是变成了走门子、拉关系的竞争。这样的竞争非但不能治好企业，反而助长了不正之风。这种情况对承包责任制的健康推行有极大的害处，它打着企业改革的牌子，败坏了承包制的声誉；它人为地制造了许多矛盾，影响了企业生产的发展。
    防止这类现象的发生，最重要的是必须坚持公平、公正、公开的原则。首先是公平，各个投标者都在同一起跑线上，按同样的规则竞争，各显神通，充分表达自己的治厂方案和拿出经过努力可以实现的标底，以此来竞争，不能对某些人附加其他任何条件。
    评判要公正。谁能中标，不能靠私人感情用事，更不能看某些有偏见的长官的眼色行事。
    公开，更是不可少的。公开是保证能否实现公平、公正的重要条件，在众目睽睽之下，一些人想要徇私作弊是比较困难的。因此，我们又往往可以从公开的程度判断公平、公正的程度。
    公平、公正、公开，并不是很难做到的事情。辽宁省本溪市有个“破烂王”，在全国都出了名的，他从１９８４年７月至１９８７年５月承包本溪市物资回收公司，３年获利相当之前最好年度９年的利润总和，而后又取得新成绩，成为辽宁省、本溪市的劳动模范。今年初，“破烂王”承包到期，２月中旬，市政府公开招聘物资回收公司总经理，没料到，强中还有强中手，“破烂王”在竞争中落标，原市土产建材公司经理尹德宝中标。尽管有不少人觉得应该考虑“破烂王”过去的功劳，市政府认为不能搞照顾，必须坚持公平、公开、择优的原则，谁的能力强就让谁上。
    从这些事例中，我们可以看出，凡是有私利腐蚀权力的地方，就会发生变味现象。而坚持公平、公正，特别是公开的原则，是防止变味的重要措施。道理很简单，不见阳光的地方，东西就容易发霉，那么，就把它们拿到光天化日之下来吧。
