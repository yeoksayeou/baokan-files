Health Minister Chen Minzhang emphasized that health reform must prioritize quality service.

		The People's Daily, Beijing, February 18th - At today's afternoon national teleconference, Health Minister Chen Minzhang discussed the implementation of the "Opinions on Expanding Medical and Health Services" recently approved by the State Council. He emphasized that current health reforms must adhere to the socialist direction and prioritize providing high-quality services to society.

		Chen Minzhang said: Medical and health units implementing the contract responsibility system should not simply copy corporate contract methods. The contract should not be narrowly understood as merely economic indicators. Comprehensive contract content should include administrative leadership responsibility, target management, task indicators, quota management, economic accounting, post responsibility system, the principle of more pay for more work, spiritual civilization construction, teaching, and research tasks, etc. If there is no classification guidance, excessive emphasis on economic single indicators, coupled with uncoordinated policies and lax management, it will inevitably induce and expand unreasonable economic behaviors and short-term behaviors.

		He pointed out that it is very necessary for health management departments to establish clear evaluation standards and scientific assessment indicator systems, strengthen macro-management, and create conditions for public and social supervision.

		Regarding medical personnel engaging in part-time services and secondary jobs, Chen Minzhang believes: Without organization and constraints, relying solely on spontaneity will bring some negative elements.

		He said, "The practice of the past two years shows that advocating for organized and led activities is beneficial for ensuring service quality and preventing some people from spending too much time on part-time services, affecting normal work, professional learning, and their own technical improvement."

		Regarding medical units organizing surplus personnel to engage in "supplementing the main with the secondary" and "assisting medicine with work," Chen Minzhang holds a positive attitude. He said, "This not only supplements the shortage of health funds but also helps to meet the needs of medical and health services. However, it should not be done hastily. Units without conditions should not abandon the main theme of medical and health tasks to enthusiastically develop secondary businesses. Personnel and quotas must be clearly separated. The primary task and main focus of the leaders of medical and health units should be on completing medical and health service tasks, and they must not disrupt and affect the normal order of medical work."

　　卫生部部长陈敏章强调    
    卫生改革要以优质服务为宗旨
    本报北京２月１８日讯  在今天下午召开的全国电话会议上，卫生部部长陈敏章就日前国务院批发的《关于扩大医疗卫生服务有关问题的意见》的贯彻实施提出要求，强调当前卫生改革必须坚持社会主义方向，以为社会提供优质服务为宗旨。
    陈敏章说：医疗卫生单位推行承包责任制，不能简单照搬企业承包的办法。不能把承包片面理解为只是经济指标方面的单项承包。综合承包的内容应包括行政首长负责、目标管理、任务指标、定额包干、经济核算、岗位责任制、多劳多得的分配原则、精神文明建设、教学和科研任务等。如果不实行分类指导，过分突出经济单项指标，加上政策不配套和管理不严，就必然要诱发和扩大不合理的经济行为和短期行为。
    他指出，卫生管理部门制定明确的考核标准和科学的评估指标体系，加强宏观管理和创造群众和社会监督的条件，是非常必要的。
    谈到医务人员开展业余服务和兼职问题时，陈敏章认为：如果没有组织和约束，只靠自发，就会带来一些消极的东西。
    他说：“这两年的实践表明，提倡有组织有领导地进行，既有利于提供保证监督服务的质量，又可防止有些人把过多的时间放在业余服务上，影响正常工作、业务学习和自身技术的提高。”
    对医疗单位组织富余人员搞“以副补主”、“以工助医”问题，陈敏章持赞成态度。他表示：“这既弥补了卫生经费的不足，也有利于配合医疗卫生业务需要，但不能一哄而上。没有条件的单位，不能丢了医疗卫生任务的主题去热心开发副业。人员和编制上必须明确分开，医疗卫生单位的领导的首要任务和主要精力应放在完成医疗卫生保健服务任务上，绝不能冲击和影响正常的医疗工作秩序。”
