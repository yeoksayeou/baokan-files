Title: The Return of the Manure Trucks to the City

This is a scene that the author witnessed in some county towns in Zhangjiakou, Hebei Province: As midnight approaches, the people of the county town fall asleep, but farmers from nearby villages quietly enter the city. Some drive carts, others operate small four-wheel trucks, and still others carry dual baskets. They are here to collect manure.

In Shangyi County, the author conducted a follow-up interview: In the toilet of a government office, two farmers from Nanwan Town's Vegetable Village were seen diligently collecting manure. They are father and son. The father is the village committee director. His son wields a pickaxe, breaking up the frozen manure into smaller pieces. Despite the temperature dropping to minus 30 degrees Celsius, the young man's forehead is still sweating. The elderly man, dressed in a white sheepskin coat, continuously shovels the manure chunks into a small cart.

"Grandpa, do you come to collect manure every day?"
"Without fail."
"How much do you collect each day?"
"Not much."
"Are there so many toilets in the county town?" I was somewhat surprised.
"There are many toilets, but there are even more people collecting manure." The young man took over the conversation. "Now, the toilets are all contracted out. Look," he pointed to a wooden board on the wall with nine characters written on it: "Contractor Zhang Yongfu."

"Since last winter, how much manure have you and your father collected together?"
"About 30 cubic meters."

Old Wu from the county government office told me that nearly a thousand farmers from the two townships near the county town come to collect manure.

A few years ago, due to the neglect of farming, the number of people coming to collect manure also decreased. Zhang, the deputy county magistrate of Zhuolu County, recounted an interesting and thought-provoking incident: A toilet in a certain store in the county town was previously cleaned by farmers who would invite the store's leaders for a meal. Later, the situation reversed, and the store had to pay to hire people to clean the toilet, sometimes even treating the cleaners to a few drinks. Now, it has changed again. Farmers from various townships near the county town come to collect manure, and manure has become "valuable" again!

To ensure a bumper grain harvest this year, since last winter, Zhangjiakou region's rural areas have seen a fervor for fertilizer collection. According to statistics from Shangyi and Zhuolu counties alone, over 18 million cubic meters of fertilizer have already been collected.

　　又见粪车进城
    曹斌
    这是笔者在河北省张家口地区一些县城看到的情景：每临午夜，县城的人进入梦乡，附近乡村农民却从四方悄然进城，有的赶着轱辘车，有的开着小四轮，也有的挑着双筐。他们是进城掏粪的。
    在尚义县城，笔者进行了一次追踪采访：在一个机关的厕所，只见从南?欠镇蔬菜村来的两位农民正在用力起粪。他们是父子俩。父亲是村委会主任。他的儿子挥动着镐头，把冻成一块的粪尿刨成碎块。尽管坝上的气温降到零下３０多度，但小伙子头上还冒着热气。穿着白茬羊皮袄的老汉用铁锨不停地把粪块扔进小车。
    “老大爷，您天天来掏粪吗？”
    “一天不落。”
    “每天能掏多少？”
    “掏不多。”
    “县城这么多厕所？”我有些惊奇。
    “厕所多，掏粪的人更多。”小伙子接过话茬，“现在厕所都承包了，你看。”顺着他的手指，只见厕所墙上钉了一块木板，上面写着９个字：“承包人张永富”。
    “去冬以来，您父子俩共掏了多少粪？”
    “大概有３０多立方米”。
    县政府办公室的老武告诉我，县城附近的两个乡镇有近千农民进城掏粪。
    前些年，由于种田受到冷落，进城掏粪的人也少了。涿鹿县张副县长讲了一件有趣而又引人深思的事：县城某商店有个厕所，早先为了掏粪，农民总要请商店领导吃一顿。后来翻了个，得商店掏钱雇人掏厕所，有时，还得请掏粪人喝几盅。现在又变了。县城附近各乡农民都进城掏粪，大粪又“香”起来了！
    为了夺取今年粮食丰收，去冬以来，张家口地区农村出现了一个积肥热，仅据尚义、涿鹿两县统计，就已积肥１８００多万立方米。
