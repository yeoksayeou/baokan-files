Pearl S. Buck Introduces Lao She to Curtis Brown

Dear Mr. Curtis Brown:

Mr. Shuo Sheyi (Lao She, the author of "Camel Xianzi") is looking for a new agent. Currently, Hugh Heces is his agent, but due to his heavy household responsibilities, he may reduce his workload or even give up this job. Mr. Shuo has asked us to recommend an agent for him, and I think you would be an ideal candidate. Mr. Shuo is a very quiet and somewhat shy person, and he is also not very accustomed to the living environment here.

Currently, he is translating a long novel titled "Four Generations Under One Roof." Due to the following reasons, his affairs are in a state of chaos. Perhaps it is best for me to briefly explain the crux of the matter to you.

The translator of his works, Ivan King (pen name), translated "Camel Xianzi" without consulting him. You may also know that it was selected as a "Book of the Month." However, for a considerable period, Mr. Shuo did not receive any royalties. I guess he might not have known that the book had achieved such good results, or he might not have known that the book had been published at all. Later, it was only with the help of friends that he was able to share 50% of the royalties.

Last year, Lin Yutang's second daughter, Lin Taiyi (phonetic transcription), wanted to translate one of Mr. Shuo's early novels, "Divorce," but John Day did not know that this would conflict with Mr. Shuo's publishing plans with Reynolds and Hitchcock Company, so this idea was aborted. Meanwhile, Ivan King returned to China and fell seriously ill. During his hospital recovery, he began translating "Divorce." At first, the translation seemed to be going smoothly, and he seemed to have Mr. Shuo's best interests at heart. However, later, to Mr. Shuo's great dismay, he found that Ivan King's translation deviated significantly from the original in many important aspects, and the ending was completely different from the original. In fact, he had been very dissatisfied with Ivan King's arbitrary changes when translating "Camel Xianzi." Therefore, when he discovered that Ivan King was repeating the same trick, he found it intolerable and refused to acknowledge Ivan King's work. During this period, since "Divorce" had become a pending case, Mr. Shuo, together with Miss Ada Pried, began translating another of his long novels, "Four Generations Under One Roof." You may already know that Mr. Shuo is one of the most important contemporary Chinese writers, so I suggest that he and Miss Ada Pried continue with the translation. In fact, they have made very good progress. Additionally, to help him complete this work, I also helped Mr. Shuo extend his visa. He is also not safe to return to his country, as he is a well-known democrat. If he returns, he will either be killed or at least imprisoned.

I suggest that if you can, as I hope, accept Mr. Shuo as your client, you should have a good talk with him about his affairs.

The above includes some of the main issues. After you talk with Mr. Shuo, you will learn more details.

Sincerely yours,

Pearl S. Buck

　　赛珍珠为介绍老舍致劳埃得的信件
    亲爱的劳埃得先生：
    舒舍予先生（即老舍，《骆驼祥子》的作者）正在寻找新的代理人。眼下休伊特·赫茨是他的代理，但她由于家务繁重，可能要减少委托工作量，甚至可能要放弃这一工作。舒先生请我们给他推荐一位代理人，我认为你是很理想的人选。舒先生人很文静、十分腼腆，还很不适应这里的生活环境。
    目前，他正在翻译一部长篇小说，名字叫《四世同堂》。由于下面一些原因，他的事情正处于混乱状态。或许，我最好先给你简单谈一下问题的症结所在。
    他作品的译者伊文·金（笔名），在没和他打招呼的情况下，翻译了《骆驼祥子》。你可能也知道，入选为“每月佳书”。但在相当一段时间里，舒先生没有收到任何报酬。我猜想，当时他可能不知道那本书取得了这么好的效果，甚至可能根本不知道这本书已经出版了。后来，还是在朋友们的帮助下，他才分享到５０％的版权税。
    去年，林语堂的二女儿林泰逸（译音）想翻译舒先生早期的一本小说《离婚》，因为约翰德不知道他们此举和舒先生与雷诺和希契科克公司的出版计划相冲突，结果这一设想就流产了。与此同时，伊文·金返回中国后生了一场大病，在住院恢复期间，他着手翻译了《离婚》。开始的时候，翻译工作似乎进行得还顺利，他好像也很为舒先生着想。但后来，使舒先生十分不安的是，他发现伊文·金的译文在许多重要方面大大偏离了原著，结尾则和原著完全不同。事实上，他对伊文·金在翻译《骆驼祥子》时擅自进行改动本来就十分不满。因此，当他发现伊文·金又故技重演时，他感到无法容忍这件事，并且拒绝承认伊文·金的工作。在这期间，既然《离婚》成了一起悬案，舒先生便和艾达·浦爱德小姐一起，着手翻译他的另一部长篇小说《四世同堂》。可能不用我说你也知道，舒先生是当代中国最重要的作家，所以我建议他和艾达·浦爱德小姐继续翻译下去，事实上，他们取得了很不错的进展。另外，为了让他能完成这一工作，我还帮助舒先生延长了他的签证。他现在回国也很不安全，因为他是个著名的民主人士，回去后不是被杀，至少也得被捕进监狱。
    我建议，如果你能像我所希望的那样，接受舒先生作为你的委托人的话，你们应该就他的事好好谈一谈。
    以上大致包括了一些主要问题，你和舒先生谈过之后，会详细地了解到更多的情况。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　你真诚的
