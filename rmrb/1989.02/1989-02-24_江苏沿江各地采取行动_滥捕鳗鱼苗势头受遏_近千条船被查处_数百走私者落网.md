	Jiangsu Stakeholders Along the Yangtze Take Action to Curb Illegal Eel Fry Fishing

	Nearly 1,000 Boats Seized, Hundreds of Smugglers Caught

	BEIJING, Feb. 23 — After the People's Daily exposed the rampant illegal fishing of eel fry in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River on Feb. 20, Jiangsu province has taken swift action. Various counties and cities along the river have launched operations to crack down on illegal fishing and smuggling of eel fry.

	A team led by the deputy director of the provincial fisheries bureau has arrived in Zhangjiagang City. A large fisheries law enforcement vessel entered the waters between Nantong and Jiangyin early this morning to coordinate the province-wide crackdown. Key officials from Suzhou, Wuxi, Jingjiang, and other cities and counties have rushed to the front lines along the river. According to incomplete statistics from various regions, nearly 1,000 illegal fishing boats have been seized along the river, over 3,000 fishing nets have been confiscated, and a large number of lawbreakers have been fined. A significant amount of eel fry has been seized. While operations are underway on the water, stations and docks along the river have also strengthened inspections to prevent the smuggling of eel fry. Hundreds of smugglers have been apprehended.

	The situation where tens of thousands of eel fry fishing boats crowded the river has significantly improved. The waters from Nantong Port to the Tiancheng Power Plant have been cleared, and the operation of passenger and cargo ships on the Yangtze River has returned to normal. The crackdown is still ongoing.

　　江苏沿江各地采取行动
    滥捕鳗鱼苗势头受遏
    近千条船被查处　数百走私者落网
    本报南通２月２３日电  本报２０日披露了长江下游狂捞滥捕鳗苗的消息后，在江苏引起强烈反响，沿江各县市纷纷采取行动，打击非法捕捞走私鳗苗的不法行为。
    一个由省水产局副局长带领的查禁领导小组已到达张家港市。一艘大型渔政船，今天凌晨进入南通至江阴水域，指挥全省沿江的查禁工作。苏州、无锡、靖江等市县主要负责同志已赶到沿江第一线。据各地的不完全统计，沿江各地查处的非法捕捞船已近１０００条，没收各类网具３０００多口，大批不法分子被罚款，为数可观的鳗苗被充公。在水上行动的同时，沿江各车站码头也加强了鳗苗走私检查活动，数百名走私分子被查获。
    现在，数以万计的捕鳗苗船拥塞江面上的情况大为改变，南通港至天生港发电厂水域业已疏通，长航客货轮运行趋于正常。查禁活动还在进行中。
