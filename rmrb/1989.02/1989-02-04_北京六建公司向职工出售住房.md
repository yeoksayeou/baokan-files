On the afternoon of February 3, 31 employees of the Beijing Sixth Construction Engineering Company joyfully received their red plastic-covered property ownership certificates. They were the latest group to pay in full for their own homes.

The Sixth Construction Company is one of Beijing's pilot units for housing reform. The company is selling mainly old houses currently occupied by employees. Following Beijing's housing reform principle of "starting with sales, reasonable discounts, no subsidies, no giveaways," those who pay off their housing loans within one to three years will receive discounts of 15% to 20%.

So far, 503 employees of the Sixth Construction Company have registered to buy houses. Preliminary statistics show that the company's sold houses will gradually recover funds totaling 3.77 million yuan, which will be deposited into a special account in the bank and then used to build houses for employees.

　　北京六建公司向职工出售住房
    本报讯  ２月３日下午，北京市第六建筑工程公司的３１户职工高兴地领到了大红塑料皮的房产所有证，他们是最近一次性交款买下自己住房的。
    市六建公司是北京房改试点单位之一。六建出售的房屋主要是职工现住的旧房，根据北京市房改“以卖房起步、合理优惠、不搞补助、不搞甩卖”的原则，一至三年内付清房款者，分别给予１５％—２０％的优惠。
    到目前为止六建公司已有５０３位职工登记购房。据初步统计，六建公司售出的房屋将陆续回收资金３７７万元，存入专户银行后再为职工盖房。
