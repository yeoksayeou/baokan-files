Title: Curing Amnesia

Some people say that most Chinese people suffer from amnesia. I think there is some truth to this statement, although it cannot be generalized. "Once the wound heals, the pain is forgotten" is perhaps a common human trait. However, remembering only the good times and forgetting the bad, having a poor memory but an excellent ability to forget, committing the same mistakes over and over again, and repeatedly falling into the same traps—it seems fair to say that those who do this are indeed suffering from amnesia. In fact, this problem has been around since ancient times; it is a chronic disease passed down from our ancestors. Looking back at history, we see that over the course of more than two thousand years, dynasties have repeatedly changed hands, with frequent regime changes. This doesn't this show that some people suffer from a stubborn form of amnesia that is hard to cure?

A late Tang Dynasty poet wrote a humorous poem that captures this well: "The Southern Dynasty emperors loved pleasure, guarding their lands until the end. They prepared for war but were destroyed by song and dance." This poem, though a bit crude and not quite refined, reveals a pattern: In feudal society, the founding emperors of each dynasty were often men of great talent and achievement, excelling in both civil and military affairs. They took advantage of the previous dynasty's rulers' indulgence in pleasure and enjoyment, political corruption, and public dissatisfaction, seizing the opportunity to overthrow the previous regime and take its place. If they encountered rivals, they would compete for control of the central plains, engaging in a life-or-death struggle until they eliminated all competitors and seized the throne. However, their descendants often indulged in pleasure and gradually became corrupt, repeating the mistakes of the previous dynasty's rulers and ultimately meeting the same fate. Despite the warnings of loyal ministers and historical records, such as "Remembering past events is a lesson for the future" and "The people of Qin did not have time to mourn themselves, but later generations mourned them. Later generations mourned them but did not learn from them, causing later generations to mourn later generations..." These warnings were almost never heeded, and the amnesia sufferers remained unaffected. The harsh reality is undeniable.

What about our situation today? It seems that the outlook is not very optimistic. The "Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution," a catastrophe unprecedented in history, ended only twelve years ago, but some people have already forgotten its painful lessons. It is said that some young people today do not even know who Lin Biao and Jiang Qing were, let alone what the "Gang of Four" was. It is no wonder that a Shanghai newspaper published an interview with Wang Li, openly praising his achievements.

Some people might think that the above situations are minor and not worth making a fuss about. I believe the problem is not so simple, because the seriousness of the matter lies in the fact that some people not only do not consider suffering from amnesia a shame, but even insist on "not discussing it anymore" as the correct way to deal with the "Cultural Revolution." The result is the spread of amnesia and the resurgence of the dregs of the "Cultural Revolution." If this trend continues, there is a real danger of it happening again.

Lu Xun once said: "A poor memory is beneficial to oneself but harmful to one's descendants. People can gradually free themselves from past sufferings because they can forget, but because they can forget, they often repeat the mistakes of their predecessors." (From *Lu Xun's Complete Works*, Volume 5, *Indignation*) For our own sake, for the sake of our descendants, and not to mention for the future of our country, let's treat this amnesia!

　　治治健忘症
    于浩成
    有人说，我们中国人大都犯有健忘症，我觉得这种说法似乎有些道理，虽然也还不能一概而论。“好了疮疤忘了疼”，也许是人之常情。然而只记吃不记打，记性不大而忘性却不小，自己犯过某种错误，后来又一犯再犯，老是不断重复，给这种人戴上健忘症患者的帽子恐怕不能说是冤枉了他们吧。其实，这种毛病应该说是古已有之，即祖宗遗传下来的沉疴老病。翻开历史一看，在两千多年之内封建王朝不断更替，改朝换代的事情频繁发生，这不就显示了某些人患有健忘之顽症，很难改掉、治愈的吗？晚唐一位诗人有一首打油诗说得好：“南朝天子爱风流，尽守江山不到头。总为战争收拾得，却因歌舞破除休。”这首诗虽然有点油腔滑调，难登大雅之堂，但却揭示了一个定律：在封建社会中，各个朝代的开国帝王往往是雄才大略，文治武功都有一套，乘着前朝统治者耽于淫乐享受，政治腐败，人心不满，统治动摇的机会，起兵一举推翻前朝，取而代之。如遇到竞争者，则逐鹿中原，经过一番你死我活的争夺战，最后扫平群雄，取得天下。而他的后代子孙，往往又歌舞升平，逐渐腐化堕落，重蹈前朝亡国之君的覆辙，最后身死而朝灭。尽管有忠臣的谏诤，史书的警告，如说什么“前事不忘，后事之师”。“秦人不暇自哀而后人哀之，后人哀之而不鉴之，是亦使后人复哀后人也”……等等，这些话头几乎是没有一个朝代不一再重复的，然而总是收效甚微，对那些健忘症患者几乎是“东风吹马耳”，根本不起任何作用。看来，无情的史实正是如此，这是无法否认掉的。
    那么，我们今天的情况又如何呢？看来，情况也仍然未可乐观。那场称得起是史无前例的空前浩劫——“文化大革命”结束到现在不过仅仅十二年，有些人不是早已把“文化大革命”的惨痛教训忘得一干二净了的吗？据说现在有些青少年连林彪、江青为何许人都不知道了，至于什么“王关戚”则更毫无所知，这就难怪上海一家报纸居然刊出了王力的访问记，明目张胆地为王力评功摆好了。
    有些人可能认为上述情形不过是小事一桩，值不得大惊小怪。我认为恐怕问题并不那么简单，因为问题的严重性在于有些人早就不但不以患有健忘症为耻，而且反屡屡以“不要谈了”作为正确对待“文革”的规范行为要求于人，其结果就是健忘症的蔓延，就是“文革”沉渣的浮起。照此发展下去，真有“再来一次”之虑了。
    鲁迅先生说过：“记性不佳，是有益于己而有害于子孙的。人们因为能忘却，所以自己能渐渐地脱离了受过的苦痛，也因为能忘却，所以往往照样地再犯前人的错误”。（见《鲁迅全集》五卷《愤》）为了自己，为了子孙，更不用说为了祖国的前途，治一治健忘症吧！
