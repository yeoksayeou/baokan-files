	Japanese Meteorological Agency Report Says
	Greenhouse Effect Accelerates Global Temperature Rise

	Our reporter Sun Dongmin reports from Tokyo: Climate anomalies, acid rain, and desertification are increasingly becoming global environmental issues that are drawing attention from various countries. The Japanese Meteorological Agency's Climate Issues Consultative Meeting has issued a report warning that if left unchecked, the greenhouse effect caused by carbon dioxide and other gases will result in a global average temperature increase of 1.5 to 3.5 degrees Celsius in 40 years, potentially causing sea levels to rise by more than one meter.

	The report suggests that over the past 100 years, the average global temperature has increased by 0.3 to 0.7 degrees Celsius. In the past 20 to 30 years, carbon dioxide gas has increased by 0.4% annually, freons by 5% to 10%, and methane by 1% to 2%. Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere absorb heat from the Earth's surface and oceans, raising temperatures near the surface and creating the so-called greenhouse effect.

	The report points out that due to the smaller ocean area in the Northern Hemisphere, the greenhouse effect is more pronounced. In high-latitude regions, temperatures may rise by 6 to 16 degrees Celsius, and precipitation and evaporation will also increase significantly. In the Northern Hemisphere, the mid-latitude precipitation belt will shift towards higher latitudes, accelerating snowmelt and causing inland soil to become dry. Some scholars believe that last year's drought in North America may be related to the greenhouse effect. Additionally, by the mid-21st century, due to thermal expansion of seawater and partial melting of polar ice, sea levels will rise. This will be a significant issue for low-lying countries.

	Freons are widely used in Japan. The issue of freon usage is sparking widespread debate. Globally, approximately 110,000 tons of freons are produced annually, with Japan using about 17,000 tons, more than half of which is used for cleaning semiconductor components. Freons released into the atmosphere destroy the ozone layer, which absorbs harmful ultraviolet rays (often referred to as the Earth's "spacesuit"), threatening the Earth's ecological balance. In light of this, Japan has decided to reduce freon consumption by half and production by 35% over the next 10 years through gas recovery and recycling.

### 日本气象厅研究报告说　温室效应使全球气温加快上升

　　日本气象厅研究报告说
　　温室效应使全球气温加快上升
    本报东京电　记者孙东民报道：世界范围的气候反常、酸性雨、沙漠化等地球环境问题，目前越来越受到各国重视。日本气象厅气候问题恳谈会研究报告提出警告：如果放任不管，二氧化碳等造成的温室效应，40年后全球的平均气温将上升1.5摄氏度到3.5摄氏度，甚至可能使海平面上升1米以上。
    报告认为，过去100年间地球上平均气温已上升0.3摄氏度到0.7摄氏度。最近20至30年间，二氧化碳气体每年增加0.4％、氟利昂气体增加5％至10％，甲烷气体增加1％至2％。大气中的水蒸气和碳酸气体吸收地表和海面的热量，使地表附近的温度上升，产生所谓温室效应。
    报告指出，由于北半球海洋面积小，温室效应更明显，在高纬度地区，气温可能上升6摄氏度至16摄氏度，水份的降水量和蒸发量亦显著增加。在北半球，中纬度的降水带向高纬度移，雪融加快，还造成大陆内部土壤干燥。有学者认为，去年北美出现的干旱，可能与温室效应不无关系。此外，到下个世纪中期，由于海水热膨胀，极地部分冰块融解，造成海面上升。这对处在低洼地国家来说，将不是等闲视之的问题。
    氟利昂在日本被广泛使用。有关氟利昂的使用问题正引起广泛的议论。全世界每年约生产氟利昂110万吨，其中日本的使用量约17万吨，一半以上用于清洗半导体元件。散发到大气中的氟利昂破坏能吸收有害紫外线的臭氧层（俗称地球的“宇宙服”），危及地球的生态平衡。鉴于此，日本决定今后10年，通过废气回收、循环使用，将使氟利昂的消费量减半，产量减少35％。
