On March 10, 1987, our department wired 1,650 yuan to the Heilongjiang Korean National Publishing House in Mudanjiang City from the central branch of the Bank of China in Shigatse to order a copy of "The History of the Korean War." By June of the following year, we still had not received the book. We wrote to inquire, and the publishing house replied that they had not received the payment. We checked the bank's telegraphic transfer voucher, and the receiving bank, the receiving unit, and the account number were all correct. Since then, we have gone to the bank to inquire nine times and sent multiple letters and telegrams to the publishing house. To this day, there has been no resolution. Where has this money gone?

　　这笔购书款何处寻？
    一九八七年三月十日，我科在日喀则市中心支行电汇一千六百五十元给牡丹江市黑龙江朝鲜民族出版社订购《韩国战争史》一书。去年六月，仍未收到书。我们写信询问，出版社复信说，未收到书款。我们核查了银行电汇凭证，汇入银行、收款单位、帐号等完全正确无误。此后，我们先后九次去银行查询，多次给出版社去信去电。至今仍无结果。这笔款到底哪里去了？
