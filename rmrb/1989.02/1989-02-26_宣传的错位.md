Title: Misplaced Propaganda

One Sunday, while out on the street, I happened upon Beijing's "Family Planning Propaganda Day." The streets were filled with the sound of drums and gongs, banners were everywhere, and colorful flags fluttered in the breeze. The spectacle was impressive, with a variety of new ideas and a significant investment of manpower and resources, leaving one in awe. However, I had a question: who is the target audience for this propaganda?

The answer is clear: the citizens of Beijing. The goal is to encourage everyone to support the policy of "one couple, one child." But I had another question: have these propaganda activities been misplaced?

For the policy of "one couple, one child," urban residents, especially those in major cities like Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai, are well-informed and have been practicing it for a long time. I once asked friends and classmates who work in Beijing and Shanghai and already have children: would you want another? They all responded in unison: "Even if the state gave us a thousand yuan, we wouldn't do it." Continuing to conduct family planning propaganda for these people feels redundant. In rural areas, however, the ideas of "more children, more blessings" and "the greatest disrespect is to have no offspring" still hold sway. A colleague working on family planning in the countryside mentioned that some farmers have asked him, "What is family planning?" In these areas, having three to five children is common. If this situation doesn't change, by the end of the century, even if the urban population doesn't increase, China's population will still reach 1.32 billion, with 1.025 billion of those being rural residents. This situation shows that vigorously promoting family planning in rural areas is urgently needed and important, but it is often overlooked, almost becoming a "forgotten corner" of propaganda. Not only are propaganda vehicles rarely seen, but propaganda banners and propaganda teams are also rarely encountered. I call this phenomenon "misplaced propaganda."

The reasons for this "misplacement" are likely that urban propaganda workers prefer to avoid the inconvenience of going to rural areas, especially remote mountain regions, to do educational work. They are content with doing some simple tasks like painting slogans and answering questions in the city. Additionally, the long-standing problem of formalism in propaganda work still persists, with some people preferring to create a spectacle and make a big fuss, which both satisfies higher-ups and gains them a reputation. Why not do it? Some comrades might also argue that responsibilities have been divided and assigned, "each police officer patrols their own beat." This brings us to the issue of "higher-ups" and institutional causes. Institutions are created by people and can also be changed by people. The fundamental issue is whether rural overpopulation is taken seriously.

In recent years, the phenomenon of "misplaced propaganda" has become quite common. For example, excessive logging and felling of trees mainly occurs in rural areas, but the focus of forest protection propaganda is often in the cities; the excessive hunting and killing of rare birds and animals also mostly happens in rural areas, but the focus of wildlife protection propaganda is still in the cities... These misplacements, left unaddressed for so long, have gone unnoticed, and the reasons behind them are worth pondering.

Finally, I must clarify that I am not suggesting that major cities should not carry out family planning propaganda. I am merely reminding people that propaganda work should be methodical and effective, aiming at the right targets. To improve family planning, propaganda work should go to the countryside. This is my reflection after witnessing "Family Planning Propaganda Day."

　　宣传的错位
    易运文
    星期天上街，恰逢北京市“计划生育宣传日”。大街两侧锣鼓喧天，标语琳琅，彩旗招展。其声势之壮观，花样之翻新，投入人力之多物力之众，令人叹为观止。但我却生出了一个疑问：宣传对象是谁？
    答案当然很清楚：北京市民，其目的是为了要使大家响应“一对夫妇只生一个”的号召。而我却又有了一个疑问：这些宣传活动是否办错了地方？
    对于“一对夫妇只生一个孩子”，城市居民，尤其是京津沪等大城市的居民，可谓是家喻户晓并早已实行了。我曾问过在北京、上海工作且已有小孩的朋友同学：是否还想再生一个？他们不约而同地回答：“再生一个，国家倒贴一千元都不干。”对这些人再去作计划生育宣传工作，就难免给人以“蛇足”之感。而在农村，“多子多福”、“不孝有三，无后为大”等观念还很有市场。一位在乡下做计划生育工作的同志，谈到有些农民曾睁大眼睛问他：“啥叫计划生育？”在这些地方，生三五个小孩是常事。如果这种现象不改变，到本世纪末，即使城市人口一个不增，中国也会增加到１３．２亿人，其中光农村就有１０．２５亿人。这种状况说明，在农村大张旗鼓开展计划生育宣传，已显得十分紧迫和重要，但却是一片冷清，几乎成了“被宣传遗忘的角落”。不仅宣传车很少涉足，就连宣传标语、宣传队员也绝少见面。对这种现象，我称之为“宣传的错位”。
    产生“错位”的原因，恐怕是从事宣传工作的城里人图省事，不愿到农村，尤其是偏远山区去做教育工作，满足于在城里做些刷刷标语、咨询答问之类的工作。再就是多年来形成的形式主义弊端在计划生育宣传中尚有市场，一些人喜欢造声势，大呼隆，这样既应付上面，又有了名声，何乐而不为呢？三是有的同志可能会提出已经分了片、包了干，“铁路警察，各管一段。”这就牵扯到“上头”，牵扯到体制方面的原因了。体制是人创造的，自然也可以由人来改。根本问题还是对农村超生重视不重视。
    这几年，宣传工作中的“错位”现象已见多不怪。比如，滥砍滥伐树木主要是发生在农村，但保护森林的宣传重点却往往也在城里；滥捕滥杀珍禽异兽的事也大都出在山村，宣传保护动物的重点却还是在城里……这些错位，拖之既久，竟无人指出，其间的道理，颇可玩味。
    末了要申明的是，我并不是主张大城市不要开展计划生育宣传工作，只是提醒人们注意，宣传工作要讲究方法和实效，要有的放矢，看准对象。计划生育要搞好，宣传工作要下乡。这就是我看了“计划生育宣传日”的一点感想。
