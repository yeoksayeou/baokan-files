On November 9 last year, your newspaper's fifth edition published a letter from Du Jianhua of the Luoyang Refinery in Henan, titled "The Poor Quality of Dayi Refrigerators Should Not Be Sold." On November 17, the municipal committee issued instructions to our city's refrigerator factory to take measures and handle the matter properly. The factory immediately dispatched repair personnel to the Luoyang Refinery in Henan to repair the Dayi refrigerator purchased by Comrade Du Jianhua. Du Jianhua expressed satisfaction with this. Our city's refrigerator factory also held a meeting, requiring all employees to strictly control quality and produce more high-quality products.

　　厂家接受批评修好冰箱
    去年１１月９日你报第五版刊登河南洛阳炼油厂杜建华写的《日芝冰箱质量差，不该出售》的读者来信后，１１月１７日市委批示我市冷柜厂采取措施，妥善处理。这个厂即派维修人员赴河南洛阳炼油厂，修好了杜建华同志购的日芝冰箱。对此，杜建华同志表示满意。我市冷柜厂还召开会议，要求职工严格把关，生产出更多高质量的产品。
