	Labor and Material Inputs Combined to Boost Land Productivity
	Xia County Develops 70,000 Mu of High-Yield Farmland

	XINHUA - In Shanxi Province's Xia County, efforts to increase both labor and material inputs into farmland have resulted in 70,000 mu of high-yield farmland with an average yield of over 1,000 yuan per mu. These farmlands, which account for only 12% of the total arable land, contribute to more than half of the total output value.

	The county has a total land area of 590,000 mu, with only one-third being irrigated. In the past few years, due to neglecting investments in land, the average output value per mu was only over 200 yuan. Starting in 1986, the county's Party committee and government made developing high-yield farmland a key measure for agricultural development. They encouraged farmers to increase both material and labor inputs, thereby boosting the output rate of existing land. The county has gradually established a technical promotion network consisting of county, township, village, and technical households. Over the past two years, more than 1,000 technical backbones have been trained, creating favorable conditions for developing high-yield farmland.

	Currently, the county has developed four main types of high-yield farmland: the first type is vertical planting and intercropping; the second type is protected agriculture-focused vegetable fields. The county's 10,000 mu of vegetable fields have implemented plastic film mulching, greenhouses, small arched sheds, and simple greenhouses, producing over 100 million kg of vegetables annually, with an average income of over 2,000 yuan per mu. The third type is high-yield grain fields with relay cropping. The county has 14,000 mu of farmland with a yield of over 750 kg per mu. The fourth type is economically viable forests tailored to local conditions.

　　投劳投物双管齐下　耕地产出成倍提高    
    夏县建成７万亩高效益农田
    本报讯  山西省夏县在增加对耕地物质投入的同时，注重增加劳动投入，使７万多亩农田的亩平均收益超过千元。这些农田仅占耕地总面积的１２％，产值却占一半以上。
    这个县共有土地面积５９万亩，水浇地仅有１／３。前几年，由于忽视了对土地的投入，亩产值仅２００多元。从１９８６年开始，县委、县政府把建设高效益农田作为发展农业的一项重要措施，一方面鼓励农民增加物质投入，一方面鼓励农民增加劳动投入，双管齐下，促进现有土地产出率提高。全县还逐步建立了县、乡、村和科技户组成的技术推广网络。近两年中，先后培训技术骨干１０００多人次，为建设高效益农田创造了条件。目前，这个县建成的高效益农田主要有四类：一类是立体种植间作套种田。一类是以保护地为重点的蔬菜田。全县１万亩菜地搞了地膜覆盖、大棚、小弓棚及简易温室，年产蔬菜１亿多公斤，亩收入平均２０００多元。一类是复播套种的高产粮田。全县有１．４万亩农田，亩产达７５０公斤以上。一类是因地制宜的经济林。　　（毛志远　张波峰）
