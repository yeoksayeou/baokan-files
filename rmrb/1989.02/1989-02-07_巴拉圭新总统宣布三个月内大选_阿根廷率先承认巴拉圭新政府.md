Paraguay's new president announces elections in three months
Argentina first to recognize Paraguay's new government

	New China News Agency, Beijing, February 6th - Asuncion, Paraguay: On the 5th, Paraguay's President Andres Rodriguez announced at Asuncion International Airport that Paraguay will hold national elections within the next 90 days.

	General Rodriguez made this statement after the plane carrying former President Stroessner, who had been in exile in Brazil, took off. He said, "I will act according to the constitution, and the country will hold elections within 90 days."

	This is the first time Rodriguez has explicitly stated that elections will be held since he took power in a coup on the night of February 2nd and assumed the presidency on the 3rd.

	According to Paraguay's 1968 constitution, if a president with less than two years left in their term resigns, elections must be held within three months of their resignation. Legal experts believe this regulation applies to Stroessner, who resigned after the coup. He had been in power continuously for eight terms since 1954, with his last term starting on August 15, 1988, which had not yet completed six months.

	The opposition responded cautiously to Rodriguez's announcement. Some opposition leaders believe that the time frame is too short to achieve "de-Stroessnerization," and that elections would be unfavorable for the opposition. However, they also feel that not holding elections according to the constitution would be detrimental to the country's democratization, leaving them in a difficult position.

	New China News Agency, Buenos Aires, February 4th - The Argentine government announced today that it recognizes the new government of Paraguay.

	According to official Argentine sources, Argentine Ambassador to Paraguay Raul Kihano today presented a note from the Argentine Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Paraguay's Minister of Foreign Affairs Luis Maria Agania in Asuncion. The note stated that the Argentine government appreciates Paraguay's new President Andres Rodriguez's commitment to democracy, respect for human rights, and improving relations with neighboring countries.

	On the night of February 2nd, Rodriguez led a military coup, overthrowing the Stroessner military dictatorship that had ruled Paraguay for 35 years. The next day, Rodriguez assumed the presidency of Paraguay and formed a new government consisting of seven civilians and two military officials.

	Argentina is the first Latin American country to recognize Paraguay's new government.

### 巴拉圭新总统宣布三个月内大选　阿根廷率先承认巴拉圭新政府

　　巴拉圭新总统宣布三个月内大选
　　阿根廷率先承认巴拉圭新政府
    新华社北京2月6日电  亚松森消息：巴拉圭总统安德烈斯·罗德里格斯5日在亚松森国际机场宣布，巴拉圭将在今后90天内举行大选。
    罗德里格斯将军是在流亡巴西的前总统斯特罗斯纳乘坐的飞机起飞之后发表这番谈话的。他说：“我将按宪法规定办事，国家在90天内实现选举。”
    这是罗德里格斯在本月2日夜间发动政变、3日就任总统以来第一次肯定说要实行选举。
    按巴拉圭1968年通过的宪法规定，如果任期未满2年的总统辞职，就必须在他辞职之日起3个月内举行选举。法律专家们认为，这一规定适合斯特罗斯纳的情况，他在政变后正式提出辞职，而他自1954年以来连续第8次当总统，最后一次是1988年8月15日开始的，任期还不满6个月。
    反对派对罗德里格斯的宣布反应谨慎。一些反对派领导人认为，时间仓促，难以实现“非斯特罗斯纳化”，选举对反对派不利，但如不按宪法实行选举，将不利于国家民主化，因此感到进退两难。
    新华社布宜诺斯艾利斯2月4日电　阿根廷政府今天宣布承认巴拉圭新政府。
    据阿根廷官方透露，阿根廷驻巴拉圭大使劳尔·基哈诺今天在亚松森向巴拉圭外交部长路易斯·玛丽亚·阿加尼亚转交了一份阿根廷外交部的照会。照会说，阿根廷政府赞赏巴拉圭新总统安德烈斯·罗德里格斯关于要在巴拉圭实行民主和尊重人权以及增进与邻国的关系的表示。
    罗德里格斯2月2日夜间发动军事政变，推翻了在巴拉圭实行独裁统治达35年之久的斯特罗斯纳军政权。翌日，罗德里格斯就任巴拉圭总统，并成立了由7名文人和2名军人组成的新政府。
    阿根廷是拉美第一个承认巴拉圭新政府的国家。
