Title: Why Are the Channels to the Grassroots Not Smooth?

More and more people are going to work at the grassroots level, which has become the main trend in the allocation of university graduates. Statistics show that since 1987, the number of graduates from universities nationwide who have been assigned to grassroots units has accounted for more than 80% of the total number of graduates. This year, the vast majority of graduates will still be assigned to grassroots units.

However, the allocation situation over the past two years indicates that the channels for university graduates to go to the grassroots level are not entirely smooth.

In 1987, out of the 341 graduates from colleges and universities in Hubei Province who were returned, 36% of the students were due to their unwillingness to go to the grassroots level.

At the end of last year, during the supply and demand meeting for graduates from colleges and universities in the Beijing region, although township enterprises, collective enterprises, and private institutions eager for talent opened their arms to university graduates, they were still cold-shouldered by many students. Some schools circulated the saying, "Rather have a big city household registration than a grassroots professional match."

What are the reasons for this situation?

Firstly, university students are not psychologically prepared to go to the grassroots level, and most of them are still unwilling to work there.

In the past, many university graduates were assigned to big cities, large organizations, and research institutions, which gave students the illusion that going to big cities and large organizations was natural. Therefore, when the flow of graduates in 1987 turned towards the grassroots level, they found it difficult to adapt to this reality.

Unable to go to big cities and large organizations, many students turned their attention to coastal regions and joint ventures, forming a new hotspot for employment, while those grassroots units and remote poor areas with a large demand for talent remained "forgotten corners."

A survey by the Sociology Department of Peking University showed that more than 80% of university graduates hope to go to large and medium-sized cities and coastal economic zones after graduation, while only 5% hope to go to small towns, remote areas, and rural areas; 80% hope to go to joint ventures, party and government agencies, and research institutions, while only 2.5% plan to go to collective enterprises and township enterprises.

From this survey, it can be seen that university students' employment aspirations are exactly the opposite of the employment reality.

Another reason why university students are unwilling to go to the grassroots level and remote areas is that the relevant national policies are not yet perfect.

A graduate from Renmin University of China said, "In a situation where the flow of talent has not yet formed a virtuous cycle, allocation can be described as 'once and for all.' Now, the lower the level, the more difficult it is to move personnel. If one cannot play a role at the grassroots level, one will be stuck there for life."

A student from the Law Department of Peking University also said, "The state has no substantial incentive policies for university students to go to the grassroots level and remote areas. Now, it relies only on administrative measures and ideological and political work to mobilize students. People naturally want to go to higher places, and water naturally flows to lower places, so university students all want to squeeze into big cities."

Of course, university students do not deny their own shortcomings of fearing hardship and lacking enthusiasm for practical work. Some students who entered key universities from rural or remote areas originally wanted to jump out through college, and their complaints about having to return to grassroots work are even greater.

Many places reflect that although the grassroots level and remote areas are in urgent need of talent, due to various reasons, many units are not enthusiastic about accepting university graduates. These units often have high expectations for the role of university graduates, hoping that the students assigned will quickly play a role and create benefits. If the standards are not met, they lose confidence in them. At the same time, some university graduates who have already been assigned to the grassroots level do not settle down to work. Since 1982, Beijing Heavy Machinery Factory has assigned 11 university graduates, but many of them do not settle down to work in the workshop. Now, except for one person, all of them have left. Therefore, the factory does not want to accept university graduates anymore. The head of an enterprise in Hanshan County, Anhui Province, also expressed his predicament: "The two university graduates assigned to our factory both went to study for a master's degree. They treat this place as a transit station. How can we dare to accept such students again?"

How can the channels for university graduates to go to the grassroots level be smoothed? Relevant personnel suggest that the state should formulate incentive policies for university graduates to go to the grassroots level, remote areas, and difficult industries based on the actual situation, and give preferential treatment in terms of wages, housing, professional title evaluation, and personnel mobility. Use the "interest mechanism" to replace the current "administrative orders" to attract more university graduates to go to the grassroots level and remote areas to work.

　　通向基层的渠道为何不畅
     ——大学生毕业分配观察与思考
    新华社记者  宋斌  江钱峰
    越来越多的人将去基层工作，已成为大学生毕业分配的主趋势。据统计，全国高校１９８７年以来分到基层单位的毕业生，已占毕业生总数的８０％以上。今年，绝大多数毕业生仍将分配到基层。
    然而，近两年的分配情况表明：大学毕业生流向基层的渠道并不十分畅通。
    １９８７年，湖北省高校被退回的３４１名毕业生中，有３６％的学生是因为不愿去基层而引起的。
    去年底举行的北京地区高校毕业生分配供需会上，尽管渴求人才的乡镇企业、集体企业和民办机构对大学生敞开怀抱，但还是遭到不少学生的冷落。一些学校流传着“宁要大城市户口，不要基层的专业对口”的说法。
    出现这种状况的原因何在？
    首先是大学生去基层的心理准备不足，多数人目前还不愿去基层工作。
    前些年大学生分配到大城市、大机关、科研单位的人较多，这种由于当时人才断档造成的超常毕业生流向，给大学生们一种错觉：进大城市、大机关理所当然。所以，当１９８７年毕业生流向出现多数人面向基层的大转弯时，他们便一时难以适应这一现实。
    大城市、大机关去不了，许多学生便将目光转向沿海地区、三资企业，形成了择业的新热点，而那些人才需求量大的基层单位和边远贫困地区仍是“被遗忘的角落”。
    北京大学社会学系一项调查显示：大学生毕业后希望到大中城市和沿海经济特区的占８０％以上，而希望去小城镇、边远地区和农村的仅占５％；希望到三资企业、党政机关、科研机构的占８０％，而打算去集体企业和乡镇企业的只有２．５％。
    从这项调查可以看出，大学生的择业意愿与择业现实恰好相反。
    使大学生不愿去基层和边远地区工作的还有一个原因，是目前国家的有关政策不健全。
    中国人民大学的一名毕业生说：“在人才流动尚未形成良性循环的情况下，分配可谓‘一次定终身’。现在是越往下人员越难调动，如果在基层发挥不了作用，就会一辈子困在那儿。”
    北京大学法律系一名学生也说：“国家对大学生去基层和边远地区工作并无多少实际的鼓励政策，现在仅靠行政手段和思想政治工作动员学生。人往高处走，水往低处流，大学生当然都想往大城市挤。”
    当然，大学生们也不否认自身有怕艰苦、干实际工作热情不高的缺陷。还有些从农村或边远地区考入重点大学的学生，本来就想通过考大学跳出来，对又要回基层工作抱怨情绪更大。
    许多地方反映，尽管基层和边远地区急需人才，但由于种种原因，不少单位对接收大学生态度并不积极。这些单位往往对大学生的作用期望过高，希望分来的学生很快就能发挥作用，创造效益，如达不到标准，便对他们失去信心。同时，有的已分到基层的大学生确实不安心工作。北京重型机器厂１９８２年以来分配了１１名大学生，但许多人不安心车间工作。现在这批大学生除一人外，都先后调走了。因此，这个厂便不愿再要大学生。安徽省含山县一个企业的负责人也道出苦衷：“我们厂分来的两个大学生都考研究生走了。他们把这儿当成中转站，这样的学生我们怎么敢再要？”
    到底如何才能疏通大学生流向基层的渠道？有关人士建议，国家应根据实际情况制定大学生下基层和边远地区、艰苦行业的鼓励政策，在工资、住房、职称评定、人员流动等方面给予优惠，用“利益机制”代替目前的“行政命令”，以吸引更多的大学生去基层和边远地区工作。
