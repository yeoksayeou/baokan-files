Tianjin's He Ping District has introduced a new approach to strengthen supervision by establishing integrity files for officials, which will serve as a basis for promoting and appointing officials and as a means of enhancing supervision.

Starting from last September, the district has established "integrity files" for 234 leading officials at the deputy section chief level and above in the district government and state-owned enterprises and institutions appointed by the district government. After gaining experience, the district plans to establish these files for all 3,000-plus officials in the district.

The materials collected in the "integrity files" include:

1. Content related to integrity work from the annual summaries of various units and the personal annual summaries of leading officials;
2. Situations analyzed by the district supervision bureau on a regular basis and materials obtained through investigations and research;
3. Materials and processing results from letters and visits from the public after verification;
4. Notifications and decisions from higher-level authorities;
5. Materials published in newspapers and magazines.

　　天津和平区加强监督有新招
    建立干部廉政档案
    新华社天津２月２７日电  （记者栗建昌）天津市和平区为干部建立“廉政档案”，作为提拔任用干部的依据和加强监督的手段。
    从去年９月开始，这个区已在区政府机关以及区政府任命的国营企事业单位２３４名副处级以上的领导干部中建立“廉政档案”，取得经验后将在全区３０００多名干部中全面建立。
    “廉政档案”收集的材料，一是来源于各单位年终总结和领导干部个人年终总结中有关廉政工作的内容；二是区监察局对廉政工作定期分析的情况以及开展调查研究掌握的有关材料；三是群众来信来访经调查核实的有关材料及处理结果；四是上级机关的通报、处理决定；五是报纸杂志刊登的有关材料。
