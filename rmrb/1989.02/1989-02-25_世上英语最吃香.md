	The Yugoslavian newspaper "Politika" cited materials from a British economic research institution, stating that teaching English to foreigners has become one of Britain's intangible "exports," bringing in over one billion pounds (approximately twenty billion US dollars) in revenue annually. It is estimated that currently, about one billion people in the world speak English (as a native or foreign language). Sixty percent of the world's scientists can read English, seventy percent of mail uses English addresses, and eighty percent of the information stored in computer systems is also in English. Although it has not been officially confirmed, over the past forty years, English has effectively become the main international language.

　　世上英语最吃香
    南斯拉夫《政治报》援引英国一家经济研究机构公布的材料说：向外国人教授英语，已成为英国出口的无形“商品”之一，它每年给英国带来十亿多英镑（约合二十亿美元）的收入。据估计，当今世界上约有十亿人讲英语（作为国语或外语），全世界百分之六十的科学家能够阅读英文，百分之七十的邮件用英文写地址，在电脑系统储存的信息资料中有百分之八十也是英文，虽然还没有统一确认，但近四十多年来英文实际上已成为主要的国际通用语言。　　（严正）
