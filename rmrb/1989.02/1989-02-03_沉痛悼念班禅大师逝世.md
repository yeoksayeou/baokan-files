In recent days, monks from various major monasteries, the Potala Palace, and the residence of the Panchen Lama in Lhasa, known as Xuelin Duoji Puzhang, have been holding ceremonies such as lighting lamps, chanting scriptures, and praying to mourn the passing of the Panchen Lama.

In the assembly hall of Sera Monastery, 350 monks chanted scriptures in unison to commemorate the patriotic and religious contributions of the 10th Panchen Lama, and prayed for the early reincarnation of Panchen Erdeni Qojyijab. People from various parts of Tibet have been continuously coming to Barkhor Street to burn incense, kowtow, and pray.

The living Buddha Danzen Taji of Drepung Monastery said, "We will follow the teachings of the Panchen Lama, strictly adhere to the rules, love our country and religion, and promote Buddhism."

The various mourning activities held by the major monasteries in Lhasa were organized at the request of the religious community.

On February 1, thousands of lamps were lit in the monasteries of Lhasa. Amidst the chanting of the monks, believers continuously paid their respects to the portrait of the Panchen Lama. Many believers also placed lamps in front of their home altars to mourn the passing of the Panchen Lama.

Shigatse
According to Xinhua News Agency, Shigatse, February 2 (Xinhua News Agency reporter, Central People's Radio reporter) The passing of Vice Chairman Panchen has cast a gloomy atmosphere over the towns and villages of the Shigatse region. In recent days, devout Tibetan believers have been using religious rituals and traditional customs such as turning prayer wheels, chanting scriptures, burning incense, and kowtowing to mourn their revered religious leader and great patriot, the Panchen Lama.

In the home of farmer Ciren Lobu in Shigatse Town, incense smoke fills the air day and night, and the butter lamps burn brightly. In the tall altar, there is a colorful portrait of the Panchen Lama. In front of the portrait, rows of oil lamps and incense bowls are arranged. More than a meter long incense sticks are continuously burning. The 71-year-old Ciren Lobu and his wife Zhadga sit in front of the altar, turning the prayer wheels and chanting scriptures, praying to the portrait of the Panchen Lama.

Dada, a famous carver in the Shigatse region, has seen the Panchen Lama five times since 1982. He told the reporter, "Although the master has passed away, his image and teachings are deeply engraved in my heart. I will not forget his instructions and pass on my skills to the next generation, using my actions to comfort the soul of the master."

The Panchen Lama had visited the Shigatse regional hospital twice during his lifetime, showing concern for the development of Tibetan medicine and the growth of the medical team. The hospital director Losang and secretary Dawa told the reporter, "We must remember the teachings of the master and, with all our hearts, dedicate ourselves to treating the people, thus commemorating the master."

Qinghai Provincial Political Consultative Conference Vice Chairman and Provincial Buddhist Association Vice President Gu Jiaqie (Tibetan) said, "The Panchen Lama is an outstanding religious leader who loves his country and the Communist Party. The Tibetan people will forever remember his merits."

At the invitation of the Panchen Lama, Qinghai Provincial Vice Governor Banma Danzen (Tibetan) had just returned to Xining from attending the consecration ceremony of the joint burial stupa of the Fifth to Ninth Panchen Lamas in Shigatse. He said, "Recalling the time a few days ago when we spent with the Panchen Lama in Shigatse, the master's appearance and smile are still vivid in my memory. We must follow the master's teachings and strive to work for the revitalization of the national economy and cultural education."

Qinghai Provincial Islamic Association Chairman and East Gate Mosque Management Committee Director Han Shenggui (Hui) said, "The Panchen Lama's lofty spirit of loving the Party, loving the country, and maintaining ethnic solidarity is a model for us in the religious community to learn from."

In the 1960s, Han Yingxuan (Salar), Vice Chairman of the Provincial Political Consultative Conference, served as the county magistrate of Xunhua Salar Autonomous County, the Panchen Lama's hometown. He said, "The Panchen Lama showed great respect for us Salar people. This time, for the consecration ceremony of the joint burial stupa of the Fifth to Ninth Panchen Lamas, the Panchen Lama specially sent an invitation to the Salar people of his hometown. During my stay in Shigatse, I fell ill with a cold, and the Panchen Lama, despite his busy schedule, specially came to visit me."
