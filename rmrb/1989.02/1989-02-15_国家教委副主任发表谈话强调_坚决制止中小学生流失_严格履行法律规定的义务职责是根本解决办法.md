The deputy minister of the State Education Commission, Liu Bin, recently spoke to the media about stopping dropouts among primary and secondary school students. He proposed that this year, efforts should be made to control the dropout rate among primary and secondary school students to a normal level.

In the past two years, the number of dropouts among primary and secondary school students has increased. According to statistics from 1988, 4.28 million primary school students dropped out, with a dropout rate of 3.3 percent; 2.87 million junior high school students dropped out, with a dropout rate of 6.9 percent.

Liu Bin pointed out that the severe dropout problem among primary and secondary school students will lead to a large number of new illiterates, which will greatly affect the improvement of the quality of our country's labor force and the overall quality of the nation. Effective measures must be taken to stop this trend.

He said that first, the awareness of officials at all levels and parents must be raised. At the same time, the Compulsory Education Law must be strictly implemented. Only when the government, all sectors of society, families, and schools strictly fulfill their legal obligations and responsibilities can the problem of dropouts among primary and secondary school students be solved. Liu Bin reiterated that the use of child labor must be strictly prohibited. Local authorities must immediately investigate and punish any violations of national regulations that involve hiring minors to work or engage in commerce. Relevant departments should impose legal penalties on units and individuals that hire child labor. He pointed out that education departments and primary and secondary schools must further rectify their educational ideology and significantly improve the quality of education. The number of students who are held back a grade must be strictly controlled, and it is not allowed to discriminate against or exclude students with academic deficiencies. It is even more unacceptable to deprive them of their right to education for any reason. Primary and secondary schools should reform their educational forms and content based on actual conditions, appropriately combining scientific and cultural education with labor and technical education. Local authorities should also supplement some local teaching materials. He said that local authorities must strengthen the management of school fees. The fee standards should be set by the provincial, autonomous region, and municipal governments, and schools should not set their own items and standards or arbitrarily collect fees. Liu Bin pointed out that counties and townships bear significant responsibility for solving the problem of dropouts among primary and secondary school students. Government and relevant department leaders must establish a responsibility system. If dropouts are not addressed and not reported to higher authorities, it should be considered dereliction of duty; if school principals, teachers, and relevant personnel do not take necessary measures, it is also considered dereliction of duty. He said that those who are derelict in their duties should be criticized and educated, and serious cases should be held accountable.

　　国家教委副主任发表谈话强调    
    坚决制止中小学生流失   
    严格履行法律规定的义务职责是根本解决办法
    据新华社北京二月十四日电  （记者赵卫）国家教委副主任柳斌日前就制止中小学生流失问题向新闻界发表谈话。他提出，今年争取将中小学生流失率控制到正常水平。
    近两年，中小学生流失人数有所增加。据一九八八年统计，全国小学生流失四百二十八万名，流失率为百分之三点三；初中学生流失二百八十七万名，流失率百分之六点九。
    柳斌指出，中、小学学生严重流失必导致新文盲大量产生，将极大影响我国劳动者素质和整个民族素质的提高，要采取有力措施予以制止。
    他说，首先要提高各级干部和广大家长的认识。同时要认真贯彻《义务教育法》。只有政府、社会各界、家庭和学校严格履行法律规定的义务和职责，才能解决中小学生的流失问题。柳斌重申，要严禁使用童工。各地发现违反国家规定擅自招用少儿做工、从商的，要立即查处。有关部门对招用童工的单位和责任人，应依法制裁。他指出，教育部门和中、小学校要进一步端正教学思想，大面积提高教育质量。留级生的数量要严格控制，不允许歧视、排斥品学有缺陷的学生，更不允许以任何借口剥夺他们上学的权利。中、小学在办学形式和教学内容等方面要从实际出发，进行改革，把科学文化教育与劳动技术教育适当结合起来。各地还应补充一些乡土教材。他说，各地要加强对学校收费工作的管理。收费标准由省、自治区、直辖市政府制定，各学校不得自定项目、标准，滥收费用。柳斌指出，解决中小学生流失问题，县、乡两级政府负有重大责任。政府和主管部门的有关负责人要建立责任制，对中小学生流失不处理，也不向上级报告，应视为失职行为；校长、教师及有关人员没采取必要措施也属失职行为。他说，对失职者要批评教育，严重的要追究责任。
