Leading the World in Creating Gene-Engineered Bacteria:
Yang Shengli and Wu Ruping Receive the Second Yiliada Science and Technology Award

Shanghai, January 31 (Xinhua) — The main researchers of the "Penicillin Acylase Gene-Engineered Bacteria," middle-aged scientists Yang Shengli and Wu Ruping, received the second Yiliada Science and Technology Award from Nobel laureate and renowned physicist Dr. T. D. Lee yesterday afternoon.

The Yiliada Science and Technology Award was initiated by Nobel laureate and renowned physicist Dr. T. D. Lee, and donated by Mr. Lau Wing-ling, chairman of the Yiliada Industrial Development Group Limited in Hong Kong. It is set up at the Chinese Academy of Sciences and is awarded every two years with a prize of 500,000 yuan.

The second Yiliada Science and Technology Award was presented to Yang Shengli, a researcher at the Shanghai Institute of Pharmaceutical Research, and Wu Ruping, an associate researcher. Both returned from the United States in 1982 as visiting scholars. After two years of effort, they successfully developed the Penicillin Acylase Gene-Engineered Bacteria, increasing the production of penicillin acylase by 15 to 20 times compared to previous levels. The main technical indicators are at the forefront of the world, making it the first gene-engineering project in China to complete pilot-scale production.

　　制成基因工程菌国际领先
    杨胜利吴汝平获第二届亿利达科技奖
    本报上海１月３１日电  记者萧关根报道：“青霉素酰化酶基因工程菌”的主要研制者中年科学家杨胜利和吴汝平（女），昨天下午从专程来上海的丁肇中手中接过了第二届“亿利达科技奖”奖状。
    “亿利达科技奖”是由诺贝尔奖金获得者、著名物理学家丁肇中教授倡议，香港亿利达工业发展集团有限公司董事长刘永龄先生捐赠，在中国科学院设立的一个大奖。
    自１９８６年起，每两年评选一项，奖金额为人民币５万元。
    第二届“亿利达科技奖”获得者上海药物研究所研究员杨胜利、副研究员吴汝平都是１９８２年从美国回来的访问学者。他们经过２年努力，研制成青霉素酰化酶基因工程菌，使青霉素酰化酶产量比原来提高了１５至２０倍，主要技术指标居国际领先地位，成为我国第一个完成中试的基因工程项目。
