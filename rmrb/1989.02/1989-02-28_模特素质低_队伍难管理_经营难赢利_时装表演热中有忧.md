Fashion shows have become a popular form of art in China. During this year's Spring Festival, numerous television gala events featured model performances. There are now dozens of fashion show teams across the country, a significant increase from the few that existed in the early 1980s. However, at a recent fashion model performance art seminar held in Beijing, participants, including artistic directors and managers of fashion show teams, fashion designers, theorists, dancers, and critics, expressed concerns. They pointed out that the current issues in the fashion show industry can be summarized in three phrases: low-quality models, difficult management, and unprofitable operations. These problems are closely related to the broader social environment.

The most regrettable issue is the low quality of models. Some models struggle to even walk in sync with the music, let alone understand and express the characteristics and inner emotions of various garments. This is partly due to societal biases—models are not seen as a respectable profession, and those with higher cultural backgrounds are reluctant to join. Professional models are often unemployed youth who couldn't find other opportunities. While some models have good physical appearances, it is challenging for them to acquire the necessary cultural education in music, dance, sculpture, and inner refinement. In terms of education, there are no specialized schools or textbooks, and the fragmented teaching methods fall short of meeting the demand for models in a commercial economy.

The most troublesome issue is managing the model teams. "Job-hopping" and "freelancing" are common among fashion models, and even those who are dismissed can form their own fashion show teams. This situation is detrimental to improving the overall standard of fashion shows.

Fashion modeling is a lucrative industry abroad. In China, fashion show teams operate on a self-sustaining basis but rarely make a profit. For example, the fashion show team of the China International Advertising Company relies on startup funds and sometimes struggles to cover monthly salaries, despite being one of the top teams in the country. Team members have won awards in international competitions. Apart from management issues, clothing manufacturers and society at large have not yet linked model performances with commercial activities, making it difficult for fashion show teams to survive. Enterprises do not prioritize using model performances to promote products, have limited budgets, and rarely invite performances, leading to many fashion shows being purely artistic performances. Organizers of artistic performances often provide little or no compensation to fashion show teams.

During the seminar, many participants suggested establishing model schools, forming model companies, and introducing competitive mechanisms to help China's young fashion show industry grow healthily.

This seminar was jointly organized by the magazine "March Wind" and the Taiwan-based "Nong Nong" magazine. Two guests from Taiwan, who attended the seminar, also shared some information about the fashion show industry in Taiwan.

### 模特素质低　队伍难管理　经营难赢利  时装表演热中有忧

　　模特素质低　队伍难管理　经营难赢利
    时装表演热中有忧
    本报北京２月２７日讯  记者朱碧森报道：时装表演在我国已成为一种热门艺术，今年春节期间的多台电视晚会，几乎都少不了时装模特的表演。全国时装表演队已有几十个，与８０年代初屈指可数的几个不可同日而语。但在此间举行的时装模特表演艺术研讨会上，与会的时装表演队的艺术指导和经理、服装设计师和理论家、舞蹈艺术家和评论家等不无忧虑地指出，目前时装表演中存在的问题，可以归纳为三句话：模特素质不高，队伍难以管理，经营难以赢利。这些问题与社会大环境有着密切联系。
    模特素质不高最令人遗憾。有的模特连台步都踩不到音乐的点子上，更无法理解和表达各种服装的特点与内在情感。这与社会偏见有关——未将模特看作一种高尚的职业，文化水平较高愿意跻身其中的不多，专业模特往往由无法升学的待业青年来担任。有的模特外形条件虽好，要补上音乐、舞蹈、雕塑等各种文化修养特别是内在气质的陶冶则是难事。在教育方面，没有专门的学校、专门的教材，零敲碎打的教学方法与商品经济社会对模特的大量需求相去甚远。
    最令人头疼的是模特队伍的管理。“跳槽”、“走穴”等现象在时装模特中屡见不鲜，被辞退的不合格的模特却可以自己组织起时装表演队。这种状况对提高整个时装表演水平很不利。
    时装模特在国外是很赚钱的行业。国内的时装表演队实行自负盈亏，却很少能挣钱。比如中国国际广告公司时装表演团靠拨给的开办费维持，有时连当月的工资都挣不回来，虽然该队的水平在国内是第一流的，队员曾在国际比赛中获奖。除了管理体制外，服装生产厂家以及全社会在观念上仍未将模特表演与商业活动联系起来，也使时装模特表演队伍难以生存。企业对借助模特表演宣传产品重视不够，经费有限，厂家出钱邀请的表演机会很少，因此，不少时装表演纯属艺术演出。而组织艺术性表演的单位，给时装表演队的酬劳很少甚至不给。
    研讨会上，不少人建议开办模特学校，组建模特公司，引进竞争机制等等，让我国年轻的时装模特表演事业健康成长。
    这次研讨会由《三月风》杂志和台湾《侬侬》杂志社联合举办。专程来京参加研讨会的两位台湾客人也在会上介绍了台湾时装表演业的一些情况。
