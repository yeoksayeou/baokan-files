The "Xianyang Cup" Northern Chinese Martial Arts Tournament, approved by the State Sports Commission's Martial Arts Institute, will commence on the 18th. Today, teams from Dalian and other places have passed through Beijing and are rushing to the venue day and night.

The Northern Chinese Martial Arts Tournament is a high-level competition with the distinctive characteristics of northern martial arts, which are known for their ferocity and speed. The old saying goes, "Southern fists, northern legs." Northern fighters have traditionally excelled in leg techniques, so this tournament will feature techniques such as consecutive kicks, sweeping kicks, and ground sweeps. This is a rare opportunity to study northern leg techniques.

Among the participating teams, in addition to strong contenders like the Beijing Sports Institute, there are also members of the armed police who are skilled in real combat. Therefore, top fighters from the Northwest, North China, and Northeast will showcase their superior offensive and defensive techniques on the stage. Martial arts tournaments, which allow the use of legs for kicking and wrestling, have a much broader range of attacks compared to pure boxing, and the organization of the competition must be strict. For this reason, this year it was specially stipulated that free-fighting competitions must be approved by the Martial Arts Institute before they can be held. To ensure the smooth conduct of this competition, the Xianyang Municipal Government has made full preparations. The Xianyang Real Estate Development Company and the Shaanxi Broadcasting and Television Equipment Factory, among other units, will actively serve the conference.

　　北方武术擂台赛将展现过硬腿功
    本报北京２月１５日讯  经国家体委武术院批准的“咸阳杯”中国北方武术擂台赛将于１８日打响。今天，大连等几支队伍已途经北京，日夜兼程赶赴赛场。
    中国北方武术擂台赛是一次较高水平的比赛，具有北方凶猛快速的技击特点。古语说，南拳北腿，北方选手的腿功历来高于南方，所以在本次擂台赛上会打出连环腿、扫腿、地趟等功夫，对研究北方的腿法是一次难得的机会。
    参赛的队伍中除北京体院等劲旅外还有善于实战的武警部队选手。这样，西北、华北、东北的高手在擂台上将展现出高超的攻防技术。武术擂台赛由于可用腿踢和抱摔，比起单纯拳击，攻击面要扩大几倍，比赛组织要严密。为此，今年特规定散打赛需经武术院批准方可举行。为了保证这次比赛顺利进行，咸阳市政府已作好充分准备，咸阳市房地产开发公司、陕西广播电视设备厂等单位将主动为大会服务。
