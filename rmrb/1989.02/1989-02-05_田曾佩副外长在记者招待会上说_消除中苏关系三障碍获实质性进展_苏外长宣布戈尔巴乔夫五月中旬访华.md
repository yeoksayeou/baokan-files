Vice Foreign Minister Tian Zengpei said at a press conference that substantial progress has been made in removing the three obstacles in Sino-Soviet relations. Soviet Foreign Minister announces Gorbachev's visit to China in mid-May.

BEIJING, Feb. 4 (Xinhua) -- Today in the afternoon, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze and Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Tian Zengpei held press conferences at the International Club and the Capital Airport, respectively, to comment on this round of Sino-Soviet foreign ministers' talks.

Tian Zengpei said at the press conference that Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze has concluded his official visit to China and left Beijing by plane. Over the past three days, the two foreign ministers held two rounds of talks. Chairman Deng Xiaoping and Premier Li Peng met with Shevardnadze. This visit by Shevardnadze is the first official visit by a Soviet foreign minister to China in many years. The main purpose of the visit is to prepare for the high-level meeting between the two countries and is a return visit to Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen's visit to the Soviet Union last year.

Tian Zengpei pointed out that to normalize Sino-Soviet relations, three major obstacles need to be removed. These are: the Soviet Union withdrawing its troops from Afghanistan; reducing military confrontation in the Sino-Soviet border regions, including the Soviet Union withdrawing its troops from Mongolia; and the Soviet Union urging Vietnam to withdraw its troops from Cambodia. In 1985, the Chinese side proposed that if the Soviet Union could urge Vietnam to withdraw its troops from Cambodia, a high-level meeting between China and the Soviet Union could be held. So far, substantial progress has been made in removing the three major obstacles. During Qian's visit to the Soviet Union last December, the two sides reached a preliminary agreement on holding a high-level meeting in the first half of this year. During Shevardnadze's visit, the two sides further discussed this issue. Chairman Yang Shangkun invited Chairman Gorbachev. The Soviet side accepted the invitation. The specific time of the visit is yet to be determined. The Chinese side is prepared to study the Soviet side's proposal and consult with the Soviet side to find a time that suits both parties. During the talks and meetings, both sides mentioned that the normalization of Sino-Soviet relations means that the relations between the two countries will be based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. The normalization of Sino-Soviet relations will not affect either side's relations with other countries. China continues to pursue an independent and peaceful foreign policy.

Tian Zengpei said that during Shevardnadze's visit to China, both sides spent a considerable amount of time exchanging views on the Cambodian issue, expanding the scope of understanding. Both sides agreed that the Cambodian issue should be resolved politically as soon as possible, fairly, and reasonably, and expressed their willingness to make efforts in this regard. On issues such as Vietnam withdrawing its troops from Cambodia by September this year, promoting the four-party dialogue and national reconciliation in Cambodia, both sides have similar or similar views. The Soviet Union also agreed that after Vietnam's withdrawal, the military forces of all parties in Cambodia should be frozen and possibly reduced, and there should be no foreign military forces or foreign military bases in Cambodia. For the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops, maintaining peace within Cambodia, and holding elections, international supervision is required. The United Nations should play a role in resolving the Cambodian issue. On the above issues, both sides have similar or similar views and proposals. However, on the other hand, there are also differences. For example, the Chinese side supports the establishment of a four-party interim joint government in Cambodia led by Prince Sihanouk; the Soviet side only agrees to the four-party unity in Cambodia under Sihanouk's presidency. We hope that the Soviet side will make further concrete efforts to promote a fair and reasonable resolution of the Cambodian issue. This is beneficial to Cambodia, Vietnam, and their neighboring countries, and is beneficial to the healthy development of the situation in Southeast Asia, which is also beneficial to the Soviet Union itself.

Tian Zengpei said that both sides also exchanged views on economic and trade relations, border issues, and international situations. China is willing to develop economic and trade relations with the Soviet Union on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. Specific issues will be discussed by the relevant departments of both sides. He said that this round of talks and meetings were conducted in a frank and pragmatic atmosphere. This visit is fruitful and is a step in the preparation process for the high-level meeting between China and the Soviet Union. The preparatory work for the high-level meeting between China and the Soviet Union is still ongoing.

Earlier, Shevardnadze announced at his press conference that Gorbachev will visit China in mid-May. At that time, Gorbachev "will meet with Chairman Deng Xiaoping, General Secretary Zhao Ziyang, Premier Li Peng and other leaders, which means the complete normalization of relations between the two countries." He emphasized that the normalization of Sino-Soviet relations does not harm the interests of third countries.

When talking about the Cambodian issue, he said, "Both the Soviet Union and China advocate a political solution to the Cambodian issue, and the basis is national reconciliation." He also said, "Both sides will continue to hold dialogues on the Cambodian issue. Both sides will make efforts to promote dialogue among the Khmer factions and resolve internal issues in Cambodia."

When asked about the issue of Soviet troops withdrawing from Afghanistan, Shevardnadze said that the last Soviet soldier will leave Afghanistan on February 15.

　　田曾佩副外长在记者招待会上说
　　消除中苏关系三障碍获实质性进展
　　苏外长宣布戈尔巴乔夫五月中旬访华
    本报北京２月４日讯  记者周象光、方荣萱报道：今天下午，苏联外交部长谢瓦尔德纳泽和中国外交部副部长田曾佩先后在国际俱乐部和首都机场分别举行记者招待会，就此次中苏外长会谈发表了谈话。
    田曾佩在记者招待会上说，苏联外长谢瓦尔德纳泽已经结束了对中国的正式访问，乘飞机离开北京。三天来，两国外长进行了两次会谈，邓小平主席和李鹏总理会见了谢瓦尔德纳泽。谢瓦尔德纳泽外长此次访华是多年来苏联外长对中国的第一次正式访问。访问的主要目的是为中苏高级会晤作准备，也是对钱其琛外长去年访问苏联的回访。
    田曾佩指出，为了使中苏关系正常化，需要消灭三大障碍。这就是，苏联从阿富汗撤军；在中苏边境地区减少军事对峙，包括苏联从蒙古人民共和国撤军；苏联促使越南从柬埔寨撤军。１９８５年中国方面提出，苏联如果能够促使越南从柬埔寨撤军，中苏之间就可以举行高级会晤。到目前为止，在消除三大障碍上取得了实质性的进展。在去年１２月钱外长访苏时，双方就今年上半年举行高级会晤达成了原则协议。在苏联外长此次访问期间，双方又进一步讨论了这一问题。杨尚昆主席向戈尔巴乔夫主席发出了邀请。苏方接受了邀请。访问的具体时间有待商定，中国方面准备研究苏方的建议，并同苏方进行协商，找到一个对双方都适合的时间。在会谈和会见中双方谈到，中苏关系正常化意味着两国关系将建立在和平共处五项原则的基础之上。中苏关系正常化不影响任何一方同其它国家的关系。中国继续奉行独立自主的和平外交政策。
    田曾佩说，苏联外长此次访华期间，双方用较多的时间就柬埔寨问题交换了意见，扩大了谅解的范围。双方一致认为，柬埔寨问题应该尽早、公正、合理地政治解决，并表示愿为此作出努力。在有关越南在今年９月以前从柬埔寨撤军、促进柬埔寨４方对话和民族和解等方面，双方也有相同或近似的观点。苏联也同意在越南撤军后柬埔寨各方的军队应当冻结并进行可能的削减，在柬埔寨不应该再有外国军队和外国军事基地。对于越南撤军、维持柬埔寨国内的和平以及进行大选，都要实行国际监督。在解决柬埔寨问题上应该发挥联合国的作用。在以上这些问题上，双方有相同或相似的观点和主张。但是，另一方面，也存在分歧。比如，中国方面支持在柬埔寨成立以西哈努克亲王为首的４方临时联合政府；苏联方面只同意在西哈努克主持下实现柬埔寨的４方联合。我们希望苏联方面能够进一步作出切实的努力，促进柬埔寨问题的公正、合理解决。这对柬埔寨、越南和它们的邻国都是有利的，对东南亚形势的健康发展也是有利的，这也有利于苏联本身。
    田曾佩说，双方还就经贸关系、两国边界和国际形势等问题原则地交换了意见。中国愿意在平等互利的基础上同苏联发展经贸关系。有关具体问题将由双方有关部门进行具体探讨。他说，这次会谈和会见都是在坦率和求实的气氛中进行的。这次访问是有成果的，是中苏高级会晤准备进程中的一个步骤。中苏高级会晤的准备工作还在继续进行。
    在这之前，谢瓦尔德纳泽在他举行的记者招待会上宣布：戈尔巴乔夫将于５月中旬访问中国。届时戈尔巴乔夫“将会见邓小平主席、赵紫阳总书记、李鹏总理等领导人，这就意味着实现两国关系的完全正常化”。他强调苏中关系正常化不损害第三国利益。
    在谈到柬埔寨问题时，他说，“苏中双方都主张政治解决柬埔寨问题，其基础是民族和解”。他还说，“双方将继续就柬埔寨问题进行对话。双方将努力促进高棉各派之间的对话，促进柬埔寨内部问题的解决”。
    在回答有关苏联从阿富汗撤军问题时，谢瓦尔德纳泽说，最后一名苏联士兵将在２月１５日离开阿富汗。
