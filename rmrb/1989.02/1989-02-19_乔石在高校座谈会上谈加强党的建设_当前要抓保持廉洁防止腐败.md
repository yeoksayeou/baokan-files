The State Education Commission yesterday invited some university party secretaries and presidents attending the commission's work conference to discuss issues related to party building in higher education. Qiao Shi, Li Tieying, and relevant officials from the Central Committee attended the symposium.

A responsible comrade from the State Education Commission party group and representatives from Peking University, Tsinghua University, Southeast University, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Sichuan University, and other institutions reported on their party-building work.

Qiao Shi pointed out at the meeting that the mainstream of our party is good, full of vitality and creativity, and capable of shouldering the historical mission of leading the Chinese people to build socialism with Chinese characteristics. However, we must also objectively recognize the problems within the party and cannot be complacent. It is very important to correctly assess the situation and the state of the party for us to maintain a clear mind, boost confidence, and correctly guide and carry out work.

He said that we must implement the policy of strict party governance proposed by the Thirteenth National Congress and the requirements of the Third Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee to strengthen party leadership and give full play to political advantages. We must strive to do a good job in party building. Currently, we must focus on maintaining integrity and preventing corruption as an important task. In this new historical period, since our party is tasked with leading the construction of socialist modernization, it faces the tests of governance and reform and opening up. Therefore, we must strictly govern the party, set higher and more stringent standards for party organizations at all levels and all party members, and we must not lower standards or relax requirements.

Qiao Shi also pointed out that party committees and governments at all levels must strengthen their leadership over party work and ideological and political work in universities, helping them solve the problems they face. Regardless of whether universities are implementing the principal responsibility system or still practicing the principal responsibility system under the leadership of the party committee, they must proceed from reality, seriously carry out the work of separating party and administrative functions, improve and strengthen the party's leadership over universities, and give full play to the core political role of university party organizations and the exemplary role of party members. University party organizations must strengthen their political leadership over the school trade unions and the Communist Youth League, improve their leadership methods, support their independent and autonomous activities, and give full play to their active role; they must adhere to the system of multi-party cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, properly handle relations with democratic parties in the school, supervise each other, share joys and sorrows, and work closely together.

Li Tieying presided over this symposium.

　　乔石在高校座谈会上谈加强党的建设    
    当前要抓保持廉洁防止腐败
    新华社北京２月１８日电  国家教委昨天邀集参加教委工作会议的部分高校党委书记、校长，座谈高等学校党的建设问题。乔石、李铁映及中央有关部门负责同志参加了座谈会。
    国家教委党组负责同志和北京大学、清华大学、东南大学、上海交通大学、四川大学等校的同志在会上汇报了高校党建工作情况。
    乔石在会上指出，我们党的主流是好的，是富有生机和创造力的，是能够担负起领导中国人民建设有中国特色的社会主义的历史重任的。但是，也要实事求是地看到党内存在的问题，决不能掉以轻心。正确地估计形势，估计党的状况，对于我们保持清醒的头脑，增强信心，正确指导和开展工作，都是很重要的。
    他说，要贯彻十三大提出的从严治党的方针，按照十三届三中全会提出的加强党的领导，发挥政治优势的要求，努力做好党的建设工作。当前要把保持廉洁，防止腐败作为一项重要任务来抓。在新的历史时期，由于我们党担负着领导社会主义现代化建设的艰巨任务，面临着执政和改革开放的考验，因此，必须从严治党，对各级党组织和全体共产党员提出更严格、更高的要求，决不能降低标准，放松要求。
    乔石还指出，各级党委和政府要加强对高等学校党的工作和思想政治工作的领导，帮助他们解决面临的问题。高等学校无论是在进行校长负责制试点，还是仍然实行党委领导下的校长负责制，都要从实际出发，认真搞好党政职能分开工作，改善和加强党对高等学校的领导，充分发挥高校党组织在政治上的核心作用和党员的先锋模范作用。高校党组织要加强对校工会、共青团的政治领导，改进领导方法，支持他们独立自主地开展活动，充分发挥他们的积极作用；要遵循中国共产党领导的多党合作制和政治协商制，处理好与学校民主党派的关系，互相监督，肝胆相照，荣辱与共，密切合作。
    李铁映主持了这次座谈会。
