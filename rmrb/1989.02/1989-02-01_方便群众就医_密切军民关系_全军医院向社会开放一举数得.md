In the wave of reform, military hospitals across the country have opened their doors to society. Over the past four years, they have treated a total of 550 million inpatients and outpatients from both the military and civilian sectors, amounting to 1.1 billion outpatient visits. This has significantly alleviated the difficulties civilians face in seeking medical treatment and hospitalization, thereby strengthening military-civilian relations. Meanwhile, military hospitals have seen continuous improvements in medical technology, increased scientific research achievements, and achieved good social and economic benefits.

Since military hospitals opened to society, there have been notable advancements and improvements in hospital construction, specialized technologies, military medicine, and clinical medical research. Techniques such as large-area deep burn treatment, reattachment of severed fingers, and reimplantation of severed wrists have garnered attention both domestically and internationally. The number of complex congenital heart disease cases treated surgically and the low mortality rate have reached advanced international levels. Over the past few years, the military has achieved 9,344 projects recognized with various levels of scientific and technological achievement awards.

In recent years, despite the reduction in military personnel and hospital beds, as well as the decrease in the number of hospitals and staff due to the reduction of the military by one million, military hospitals have continued to see an increase in the number of patients treated and outpatient visits. Many hospitals face challenges such as insufficient funds, personnel shortages, and prominent supply-demand contradictions. However, they persist in remaining open. In many local traffic accidents, earthquakes, natural disasters, and other emergency situations, military hospital medical teams are often the first to arrive at the scene.

　　方便群众就医　密切军民关系
    全军医院向社会开放一举数得
    本报讯  记者赖仁琼报道：全军医院在改革大潮中向社会开放，近４年来，共收治军队、地方病人５５０多万人次，门诊量达１．１亿人次，缓解了群众看病难、住院难的矛盾，密切了军民关系。与此同时，军队医院医疗技术不断提高，科研成果增多，收到良好的社会效益和经济效益。
    军队医院向社会开放后，在医院建设、专科技术、军事医学和临床医学研究方面有了较快的发展和提高。大面积深度烧伤治疗、十指断离、双腕断离再植等技术为国内外所瞩目。手术治疗复杂先天性心脏病例数之多、死亡率之低，均达到世界先进水平。几年来，全军已有９３４４个项目获得各级颁发的科技成果奖。
    近几年，在裁军百万使军队医院床位、员额、医院（所）数量减少的情况下，军队医院收治病人和门诊量则逐年增加。不少医院面临经费短缺、人员紧张、供需矛盾突出等困难，但坚持开放。在各地的交通事故、地震、自然灾害等突发性事件中，在许多时候总大多是军队医院的医疗队最先赶赴现场。
