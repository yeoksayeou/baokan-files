The depth of Cao Qun's vocal power is incredible.
Cao Qun outshines all others.
Wins the highest award at the Ballymena International Music Festival.

BEIJING, Feb. 26 (Xinhua) — Chinese male mezzo-soprano singer Cao Qun has once again achieved great honor in the UK. With a vocal power that Westerners find hard to believe and a superb performance, on the evening of the 25th, he won the "Stevenson Award," representing the highest vocal honor at this year's Ballymena International Music Festival.

The Ballymena International Music Festival, sponsored by the Queen of England, was established in 1916. Over the course of six days at the Ballymena County Music Hall, more than 100 singers from the UK, Ireland, and Italy competed in vocal, instrumental, and folk music categories. Cao Qun, a soloist from the Beijing Symphony Orchestra studying at the Royal Academy of Music in London, was the only Eastern participant in this Western singing competition.

After four rounds of competition in three categories, Cao Qun won first place in operatic singing, taking home the "Raymond Marshall Challenger Cup" and a medal. He also won first place in vocal performance technique, securing the "E. Welshman Memorial Challenger Cup" and a medal. In the oratorio singing and song interpretation categories, Cao Qun narrowly missed first place, finishing second and third by just 1 and 2 points, respectively. In the final round among the seven first-place winners (two first-place awards were given per category, and Cao Qun won first place in two categories), Cao Qun once again stunned the audience, outshining all others, and won the "Stevenson Award," representing the highest vocal honor at the music festival.

The media commented on Cao Qun's performance, saying, "It is incredible that the elegant Chinese man has such a deep and powerful Western voice." British famous musician Dennis Toucher said, Cao Qun's "singing is full of color, harmony, and stability." Local television and radio stations also reported on Cao Qun's award.

Now 30 years old, Cao Qun graduated from the Wuhan Conservatory of Music in 1983. In 1986, he won first place at the Great Grimsby International Singing Competition in the UK and was awarded a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music in the UK.

　　歌喉力度之深令人难以置信
    曹群技压群芳
    荣获巴利梅纳国际音乐节最高奖
    新华社伦敦２月２６日电  （记者李宗扬）中国男中音独唱演员曹群在英国又获殊荣。他以西方人难以置信的力度极深的歌喉和精采的表演，２５日晚在本年度巴利梅纳国际音乐节上获得代表声乐最高荣誉的“史蒂文森奖”。
    由英国女王作为赞助者的巴利梅纳国际音乐节创办于１９１６年。在北爱尔兰巴利梅纳郡音乐厅举办的为期六天的本届音乐节上，来自英国、爱尔兰和意大利的１００多位歌手参加了声乐、器乐和民间音乐等项目的比赛。正在伦敦皇家音乐学院就读的北京交响乐团独唱演员曹群作为唯一的东方人参加了这一西洋歌赛。
    经过四个项目的三轮比赛，曹群获歌剧演唱一等奖，捧走了“雷蒙德·马歇尔挑战者杯”和奖章，获声乐表现技巧一等奖，又夺得了“埃·威尔士人纪念挑战者杯”和奖章。在清唱剧演唱和歌曲诠释两个项目中，曹群分别以１分和２分之差屈居第二和第三。其后，在七名一等奖获得者的决赛中（每个项目设两个一等奖，曹群一人获两个项目的一等奖），曹群又震惊四座，压倒群雄，夺走了代表音乐节声乐最高荣誉的“史蒂文森奖”。
    报界在评论曹群的表演时说，“令人难以置信的是，典雅的中国人竟有如此力度极深的洋嗓子”。英国著名音乐家丹尼斯·汤希尔说，曹群的“演唱充满了色彩，和谐和沉稳”。此间电视台、广播电台也报道了曹群获奖的消息。
    今年３０岁的曹群是武汉音乐学院１９８３届毕业生。１９８６年，他在英国大格里姆斯比国际歌唱家比赛中获一等奖，并因此获得英国皇家音乐学院奖学金。
