The Vietnamese authorities had previously announced that they would withdraw all troops from Cambodia by September of this year. However, in recent days, Nguyen Co Thach has been flip-flopping on the issue of troop withdrawal, changing his stance repeatedly. Observe:

On February 15th, he told a Reuters reporter in Hanoi that if the second Jakarta meeting could not reach an agreement, Vietnam would not fulfill its promise to withdraw all troops from Cambodia by September.

On February 19th, before the Jakarta meeting began, he changed his tune again, saying that if an agreement could not be reached on the composition of the future Cambodian government, "Vietnam will also withdraw all its troops from Cambodia by midnight on September 30th of this year."

On the same day, after the meeting, Nguyen Co Thach retracted what he had said before the meeting and reverted to the old line that Vietnam would withdraw all its troops from Cambodia by the end of 1990.

As the Vietnamese Foreign Minister, Nguyen Co Thach's constant flip-flopping and lack of integrity are truly despicable. His shoddy performance of changing his stance repeatedly only shows that the Vietnamese authorities, despite issuing various timetables for troop withdrawal, have no intention of carrying out an unconditional withdrawal. Instead, they are trying every means possible to gain at the negotiating table what they could not achieve on the battlefield. This is obviously futile.

　　出尔反尔
    越南当局曾经宣布将在今年九月从柬埔寨撤出全部军队。但是最近几天，阮基石竟在撤军问题上出尔反尔，变来变去。请看：
    二月十五日，他在河内对法新社记者说，如果第二次雅加达会议不能达成协议，越南将不履行其今年九月从柬埔寨全部撤军的保证。
    二月十九日，在雅加达会议开幕前，他又改口说，如果不能就柬未来政府组成问题达成协议，“越南也将在今年九月三十日午夜之前从柬撤出其全部军队。”
    同日会后，阮基石又把会前说过的话吞了回去，重弹起越南要在一九九○年底才从柬全部撤军的老调。
    身为越南外长，阮基石竟如此反复无常，不讲信义，实在为人所不齿。他的这种朝三暮四的拙劣表演，只能表明越南当局尽管开出这样那样的撤军时间表，却无意实行无条件撤军，而是千方百计想在谈判桌上捞到战场上得不到的东西。这显然是徒劳的。
