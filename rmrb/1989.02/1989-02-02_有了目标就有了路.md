Life is noisy, but do not look around or pay attention to those who stand by the door and gossip.

Take big strides and walk past them confidently; dawn has risen from the riverbank—leave the idle talk to those who have nothing better to do.

	II

I picked a bunch of watery red grapes from the high trellis because I do not have the fox's complaints.

Envy me, but do not be jealous—jealousy only makes me feel proud and comforted, but it harms your health and longevity.

	III

The moon wanes and then waxes full again.

The champagne in the golden cup is about to go sour, who will drink with me?—love is a deep understanding, and also a difficult pursuit. But when I seek you, can you understand me? But that does not matter, the Earth itself is not perfectly round.

	IV

You say you dare not enter my dreams every night; similarly, I do not have the time to run to your side every day.

Time is always short for those who cherish it. Now, the rooster crows at the village corner and the dawn breaks—oh, I must hurry on my way.

	V

The river in front of the village has risen, the small bridge has been washed away, and the boat has drifted off.

But when I hear you calling from the other side, it seems as if I suddenly have wings under my arms.

With a goal, there is a path.

　　有了目标就有了路
    钟声扬
    一
    生活在喧闹，但是，请你不要左顾右盼，不要理睬那些靠着门框说三道四的人们。
    迈开大步，理直气壮地从他们的旁边走过去；黎明已从河边飘起——把闲话留给闲人去说吧。
    　　　　二
    我因为没有狐狸的牢骚，所以才从那高高的架棚上摘到了一串串水淋淋的红葡萄。
    羡慕吧，但不要嫉妒——嫉妒，只能使我感到自豪与宽慰，但却有损于你的健康与长寿。
    　　　　三
    月亮，缺了又圆。
    金杯里的香槟酒快要发酸了，谁来同我对饮呢？——爱是一种深刻的理解，也是一种艰苦的寻求。然而，我在寻求你的时候，你能够理解我吗？不过那也无妨，地球本身就不很圆。
    　　　　四
    你说，你不敢夜夜进入我的梦中；同样，我也无暇天天跑到你的身边。
    时间，对于珍惜时间的心灵永远是短暂的。此刻，村角鸡啼曙色动，——哦，我得赶紧上路了。
    　　　　五
    村前的小河涨水了，小桥冲断了，船儿漂走了。
    但是，当我听到你在对岸的召唤时，仿佛一下子就脚生风，腋长翅。
    有了目标就有了路。
