The controversy over "The Satanic Verses" continues. The author of the novel, Salman Rushdie, issued a statement last night expressing his regret for hurting the feelings of Muslims with the publication of the book.

In his statement, he said: "As the author of 'The Satanic Verses,' I am aware that Muslims around the world are distressed by the publication of my novel. I deeply regret the pain caused to the faithful followers of Islam by the publication of this book. We live in a world of diverse beliefs, and experience has seriously reminded us that we should respect the feelings of others."

The British Foreign Office is awaiting the official response from Iran to decide on the next steps. It is reported that British Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe will seek support at the European Community Foreign Ministers' meeting tomorrow.

After Rushdie's apology, the official Iranian news agency issued three reports with differing opinions, first "rejecting," then "accepting," and finally "rejecting" again.

Some writers here have jointly issued a statement supporting Rushdie, while also criticizing his apology to Muslims.

　　《撒旦的诗篇》风波未了    
    小说作者道歉　伊朗通讯社拒绝
    本报伦敦２月１９日电  记者陈特安报道：《撒旦的诗篇》作者拉什迪昨晚发表声明说，他对出版该书而伤害穆斯林的感情而深感歉意。
    他在声明中说：“作为《撒旦的诗篇》的作者，我认识到世界各地穆斯林因我的小说的出版而感到忧伤。我对该书出版后给伊斯兰教忠实信徒所造成的痛苦而深感遗憾。我们生活在一个多信仰的世界上，经验严肃地提醒我们应该尊重他人的感情”。
    英国外交部正在等待伊朗官方对此的反应，以便决定下一步行动。据报道，英国外交大臣杰弗里·豪将于明天在欧共体外长会议上寻求支持。
    伊朗官方通讯社在拉什迪道歉后，接连发表三篇意见不一的报道，先是“拒绝”，后说“接受”，最后又“拒绝”。
    此间有部分作家联名发表声明支持拉什迪，同时又批评他向穆斯林道歉的做法。
