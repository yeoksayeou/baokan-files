	After experiencing some ups and downs, China's pig farming industry has finally emerged from its trough, and fat pigs are once again filling the pens in rural areas. This is a cause for joy. However, behind this joy, there are signs of concern. Due to rising grain prices and falling piglet prices, some farmers have begun to slaughter their sows and castrate piglets that were originally intended to be sows. According to incomplete statistics, last December alone, 30 sows in my village were either slaughtered or castrated. If this trend continues, pig production will inevitably fall back into a trough. We call for the protection of sows and the protection of farmers' enthusiasm for pig farming; at the same time, we hope that farmers who have sows will overcome temporary difficulties, show mercy with their knives, and continue to raise their sows well.

　　请养猪户刀下留情
    我国的养猪事业在经历了一段波折之后，终于走出了低谷，广大农村再度肥猪满圈了。这是令人欣喜的。可是，在这欣喜的背后，却出现了令人担忧的苗头。由于粮价上涨，猪崽价格暴跌，一些农民又开始宰杀母猪，阉割原先打算留作母猪的小猪。据不完全统计，去年１２月，我村就有３０头母猪被宰杀或阉割。这样下去，生猪生产必将再度落入低谷。呼吁保护母猪，保护农民的养猪积极性；同时希望喂有母猪的农民，克服暂时困难，刀下留情，继续喂好母猪。
