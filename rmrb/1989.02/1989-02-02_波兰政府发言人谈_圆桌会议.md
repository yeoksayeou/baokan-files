	Polish Government Spokesperson Discusses the "Round Table Talks"
	The upcoming "Round Table Talks" will lead to the formation of a new parliament
	Polish Parliament Amends Property Provisions in Civil Law

	Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, January 31 - Polish government spokesperson Urban said on January 31 at a press conference that the upcoming "Round Table Talks" will lead to the formation of a new parliament.

	Urban elaborated on the official stance regarding the "Round Table Talks" scheduled to be held on February 6. He said that around the round table in the Council of Ministers' building, 56 seats will be arranged. The "Round Table Talks" are not a bilateral meeting between the authorities and part of the opposition, but a multilateral conference reflecting broad and diverse opinions. The "Round Table Talks" will also be held in groups. It is not ruled out that an agreement on parliamentary elections will be reached during the conference, and a consultation committee will be formed.

	Urban said that the "Round Table Talks" can and should lead to early parliamentary elections. The allocation of parliamentary seats will be discussed at the meeting. Before the parliamentary elections, the constitution will be amended, including the provisions related to parliamentary elections. After the new parliament is formed, whether to form a new government or reorganize the existing one will be entirely up to the new parliament.

	He said that the "Round Table Talks" will discuss the legalization of the "Solidarity" trade union. The issue of public reporting on the "Round Table Talks" will also be decided through consultations among all parties.

	Urban said that it is difficult to predict the duration of the "Round Table Talks." The government hopes that it will be as short as possible because there is no time for prolonged discussions. The government is eager to hold parliamentary elections as soon as possible.

	Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, January 31 - The amendment to the "Polish Civil Code" passed by the Polish Parliament on January 31 changes the original Article 128 of the Civil Code, which states: "Socialist state-owned property is indivisibly owned by the state," to "Socialist state-owned property is state-owned or owned by other legal entities representing the state."

	During today's parliamentary session, some deputies viewed this amendment as the first step in the reform of the socialist state-owned property system in Poland.

　　波兰政府发言人谈“圆桌会议”
    反映广泛意见的多边会议将讨论“团结工会”合法化问题将导致产生新议会
    波兰议会修改民法中所有制提法
    新华社华沙１月３１日电　波兰政府发言人乌尔班３１日在记者招待会上说，即将召开的“圆桌会议”将导致产生新的议会。
    乌尔班详细阐述了官方对即将于２月６日召开的“圆桌会议”的立场。他说，在波兰部长会议宫的圆桌周围共设５６个席位。“圆桌会议”不是当局同部分反对派的双边会晤，而是反映广泛多元化的多边会议。“圆桌会议”还将分组举行会议。不排除在会议进行期间就议会选举问题达成协议，并产生协商委员会。
    乌尔班说，“圆桌会议”能够而且应该导致提前举行议会选举。议会席位分配问题将在会上加以讨论。在议会选举之前将修改宪法，其中包括修改宪法中有关议会选举的规定。新议会产生后，是新建还是改组政府，这完全是新议会的事情。
    他说，“圆桌会议”将讨论“团结工会”合法化的问题。关于“圆桌会议”的公开报道问题，也将由各方协商决定。
    乌尔班说，很难预料“圆桌会议”日程长短，政府方面希望开得越短越好，因为没有时间进行旷日持久的讨论。政府渴望尽早举行议会大选。
    新华社华沙１月３１日电　波兰议会３１日通过的《波兰民法》修正案将原民法第１２８条：“社会主义全民（国家）所有制财产不可分割地属于国家所有制”改成了“社会主义全民（国家）所有制是国家财产所有制或代表国家的其他法人所有制”。
    在今天的议会会议上，一些议员把这一修改看作是波兰“朝着社会主义全民（国家）所有制体制改革迈出的第一步”。
