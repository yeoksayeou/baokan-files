Fujian has discovered over 6,000 cultural relics sites in the past two years, and more than 60,000 important cultural relics have been collected. These discoveries are the result of a comprehensive survey of cultural relics conducted by the cultural departments of Fujian Province across 16,884 villages in the province.

The excavation of a number of important underground cultural relics has corrected the previous misconception that Fujian has a "congenital deficiency" of underground cultural relics. These discoveries include: the human humerus fossil from the Paleolithic era found in Dongshan County, multiple fossil sites in limestone caves in Sanming and Longyan, Neolithic shell mound sites along the coast in Minhou, Yunxiao, and Xiapu, rock carvings in Hua'an, Shangzhou and Zhou heritage sites in the Jiangxi River Basin, as well as the "Chronicle of Zhu Xi," the "Genealogy of Fan Zhongyan," the bronze bell of Zheng He, the tomb of Yu Dayou, and the ancient city of Zhao Jiabao. In May 1988, a late Pleistocene human tooth fossil was discovered in Huli Cave in Shuwutai Village, Qingliu County, pushing back the known history of Fujian to 10,000 years ago. This discovery is the first significant scientific finding in Fujian's prehistoric archaeological research with a clear location and stratum.

　　福建发现文物点六千多处
　　纠正地下文物“先天不足”的说法
    新华社福州２月５日电  （记者王凡凡）据有关部门统计，福建省近两年新发现的文物点有６４５６处，征集到的重要文物标本达６万多件。
    这些新发现是福建省文化部门在全省开展文物普查的成果。这次调查的范围涉及福建省各县１６８８４个村庄。
    一批重要的地下文物的出土，纠正了以往有人认为福建地下文物“先天不足”的说法。这些发现包括：东山县旧石器时代人类肱骨遗骨，三明和龙岩地区石灰岩溶洞多处化石地点，闽侯、云霄、霞浦等沿海地区新石器时代贝丘遗址，华安等地的摩崖石刻，建溪流域的商周遗址群，以及《朱熹年谱》、《范仲淹家谱》、郑和铜钟、俞大猷墓、赵家堡古城等。１９８８年５月，在清流县沙芜台洞口村狐狸洞发现的更新世晚期人类牙齿化石，把福建历史从已知的距今七千年推进到一万年前，成为福建史前考古研究的第一次有明确地点和层位的重要科学发现。
