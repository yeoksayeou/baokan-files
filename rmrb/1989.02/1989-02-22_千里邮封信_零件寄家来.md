I purchased a Shanghai-brand washing machine from the Shanghai Washing Machine Factory in 1978. In 1986, the water wheel shaft of this washing machine broke. I visited numerous stores but couldn't find a replacement water wheel shaft of the same model. I considered writing to the factory for help, but I thought that since I had used this washing machine for nearly 9 years and the factory is so far from my county, would they take my request seriously? Last October, I still decided to try and wrote a letter to the Shanghai Washing Machine Factory. Less than a month after sending the letter, a brand-new water wheel shaft arrived from Shanghai. After replacing the water wheel shaft, the washing machine, which had been idle for two years, started working again.

　　千里邮封信  零件寄家来
    我于１９７８年买了一台上海洗衣机总厂生产的水仙牌洗衣机。１９８６年这台洗衣机的水轮轴坏了，我先后跑了不少商店，都没找到同型号的水轮轴。我想向厂里写信求援，又想这台洗衣机我使了近９年，厂家距我县又那么远，人家会当回事吗？去年１０月，我还是抱着试试看的心情，给上海洗衣机总厂写了一封信。信寄走不到一个月，一个崭新的水轮轴从上海寄来了，“休息”了两年的洗衣机换上新水轮轴后，又转动起来了。
