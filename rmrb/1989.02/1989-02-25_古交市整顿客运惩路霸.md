Your newspaper published an article on December 24th last year on the fifth page titled "Road Tyranny Rampant, Passengers Suffer," which accurately reflected the situation. The relevant departments have made the following decisions: Li Erliang, the person who assaulted others, will be administratively detained for 15 days and ordered to pay 84.70 yuan in medical expenses; Li Sanxiao, the main person responsible, will be administratively detained for 10 days and ordered to pay 72.86 yuan in medical expenses; Yang Tianchang and Zhao Haiming, who are also responsible, will be fined and receive a warning, and will be ordered to pay part of the medical expenses.

On December 28th, a joint investigation team consisting of the Municipal Transportation Bureau, Public Security Bureau, Industrial and Commercial Bureau, and Tax Bureau visited the Malan Mine Construction Engineering Department to check on the three victims, Wang Yanqing and others. Based on the investigation and verification, the team made the following decisions: confiscate the illegal income of 440 yuan from the vehicle owner and impose two fines totaling 400 yuan; order the payment of 105.60 yuan in evaded taxes and impose two fines totaling 611.20 yuan. These units will also notify the entire city about this incident and require a rectification of the city's passenger transport work.

　　古交市整顿客运惩路霸
    你报去年１２月２４日第五版刊登《路霸猖狂，乘客遭殃》的读者来信，反映的情况基本属实。有关部门已作出处理决定：对打人者李二亮给予行政拘留１５天的处分，赔偿医药费８４．７０元；对重要责任者李三小给予行政拘留１０天的处分，赔偿医药费７２．８６元；对责任者杨天昌、赵海明分别予以罚款和批评教育、赔偿部分医药费的处理。
    １２月２８日由市交通局、公安局、工商局、税务局组成的联合调查组，专程赶到马兰矿建工程处探望了王雁青等３名受害者，根据调查核实的情况重新作了处理：没收车主非法收入的４４０元，并处以两项罚款４００元；责令补交偷漏税款１０５．６０元，并处以两项罚款６１１．２０元。这几家单位还将这一事件通报全市，要求对全市客运工作进行一次整顿。
