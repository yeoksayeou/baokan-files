The microcomputer database management system CDB, developed under the leadership of Professor Zhou Longxiang of the Institute of Mathematics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, recently passed a ministerial-level technical appraisal in Beijing. This is the first high-level microcomputer data management software developed independently by our country, for which we can fully own the copyright. It is also consistent with the command system of the widely used DBAS system in China, with some expansions.

	The renowned traditional Chinese medicine expert Liu Duqiu, who has dedicated his life to the study of "injury from cold," recently published the "Dictionary of the Treatise on Cold Injury."

	The memorial service for the famous film artist Cai Chusheng was held on February 17 at the Guangzhou Film Star Hotel. Deng Yingchao inscribed the words, "Cai Chusheng is a pioneer of progressive Chinese cinema."

	The "Portraits of Famous Scientists in Chinese and Foreign History" was recently published and distributed after being reviewed by the office of the National Primary and Secondary School Textbook Review Committee.
