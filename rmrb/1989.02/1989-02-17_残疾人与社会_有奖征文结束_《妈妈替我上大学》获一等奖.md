The "Disabled People and Society" essay contest, jointly organized by the China Disabled Persons' Federation and this newspaper, has concluded, and the winning entries have been determined.

The "Disabled People and Society" essay contest began in mid-June 1988 and ended in late January of this year. A total of 50 essays were published as planned. After careful evaluation by the China Disabled Persons' Federation and this newspaper, the essay "Mother Goes to College for Me," dictated by Chu Hui and edited by Liang Yi (published on October 4, 1988), won the first prize. The second prizes went to Li Shan's "Bittersweet Life on Wheels," Qi Dezhou and Sun Xiu Pan's "Sun Shijun and His Disciples," and Wang Yousheng's "Bringing Light." The third prizes were awarded to Gong Litang's essay and Wang Manshun's photography "Artist Shi Zhenfeng Without Arms," Luo Xiao's "Burning Heart," Liu Chaocui's "Love from Across the Ocean," Shen Genjun and Liu Wei's "The Paralyzed Girl Who Loves Football," and Zhang Zhongyu and Lin Zhufen's "A Blind Couple and Their Three College-Student Sons."

This essay contest received widespread attention from all sectors of society. Over the course of half a year, the editorial department received more than 6,000 submissions, reflecting various aspects of society's concern for disabled people, as well as the disabled community's spirit of perseverance and their challenges. Due to space limitations, many high-quality essays had to be omitted. The concentrated promotion of disabled people has had a positive social impact. A new trend of understanding, respecting, caring for, and helping disabled people has been further established, and the spirit of self-respect, self-confidence, self-reliance, and self-improvement among disabled people has been further promoted. Some party and government leaders have written in to express that they will pay more attention to the work of disabled people in the future; many disabled people have written in to express that they will not be discouraged by their disabilities and will contribute to the Four Modernizations.

This essay contest was supported by the Yantai Tractor Factory, Yikang Industrial Company, and Wuhan Steel Company.

　　“残疾人与社会”有奖征文结束    
    《妈妈替我上大学》获一等奖
    本报讯  中国残疾人联合会与本报联合举办的“残疾人与社会”有奖征文活动结束，获奖名次已经评定。
    “残疾人与社会”有奖征文活动于１９８８年６月中旬开始，今年１月底结束，已按原定计划刊登稿件５０篇。经中国残联与本报认真评选，褚晖口述、梁毅整理的《妈妈替我上大学》（载１９８８年１０月４日）获一等奖；立善的《轮椅上的苦与甜》，綦德周、孙秀畔的《孙世君和他的徒弟们》，王有盛的《送光明》获二等奖；龚立堂撰文、王满顺摄影的《无臂画家师振峰》，罗霄的《滚烫的心》，刘朝粹的《来自大洋彼岸的爱》，沈根均、刘薇的《爱足球的瘫痪姑娘》，张钟玉、林珠奋的《一对盲人夫妇和三个大学生儿子》获三等奖。
    这次征文活动得到了社会各界的关注。半年中编辑部收到稿件６０００多篇，从各个侧面反映了社会对残疾人的关怀，反映了残疾人的奋发向上精神和困难。因限于篇幅，对于大量的高质量稿件只能割爱。对残疾人的集中宣传，产生了积极的社会效果。社会上理解、尊重、关心、帮助残疾人的新风尚进一步树立，残疾人自尊、自信、自强、自立的精神进一步发扬。一些党政领导人来信，表示今后要更加重视残疾人工作；许多残疾人来信，表示要身残志不残，为四化大业作出应有的贡献。
    这次征文活动，得到了邢台拖拉机厂、益康实业公司、武汉钢铁公司的支持。
