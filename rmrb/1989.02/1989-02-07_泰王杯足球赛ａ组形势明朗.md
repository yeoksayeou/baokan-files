The situation in Group B is still unclear. North Korea and Thailand B, with one win and three losses in four matches and three losses in three matches respectively, have no hope of advancing. The teams that will advance to the semi-finals will be among China, Denmark, and the Soviet Union. China and Denmark currently have two wins and one draw in three matches, while the Soviet Union has one win and two draws in three matches. The match between China and Denmark will be a decisive one for China. A win will secure a spot in the semi-finals, while a draw or loss will mean losing the chance to advance to the semi-finals.

　　泰王杯足球赛Ａ组形势明朗
    据新华社曼谷２月５日电  （记者张秋来）第２０届泰王杯足球赛小组预赛Ａ组的最后两场比赛今晚在这里举行。南朝鲜队以２∶０胜泰国Ａ队，马来西亚队以２∶１胜瑞士队。这样南朝鲜队取得四战四胜的成绩，获小组第一名，泰国Ａ队四战三胜一负获小组第二名。这两个队将参加２月８日举行的本届比赛的半决赛。
    本届比赛Ｂ组的形势还不明朗，朝鲜队和泰国Ｂ队分别由于四战一胜三负和三战三负，出线已无望外，参加半决赛的队将在中国、丹麦、苏联队之间产生。中国和丹麦队目前都是三战二胜一平，苏联队是三战一胜二平。中丹之战对中国队来说将是背水一战，胜则获半决赛权，平或负都将失去进入半决赛的资格。
