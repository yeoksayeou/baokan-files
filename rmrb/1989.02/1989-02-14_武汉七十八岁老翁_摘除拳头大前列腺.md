A 78-year-old man from Wuhan, Mr. Yu Shizhen, suffered from an enlarged prostate. Two months ago, he underwent a bladder fistula operation at a certain hospital. Due to frequent bleeding, his life was in danger. Wuhan Third Hospital performed an emergency operation on the patient, successfully removing a giant prostate weighing 350 grams, larger than an adult's fist. This is 16 to 22 times larger than a normal prostate, a rare case both domestically and internationally.
