More than 400 representatives from various ethnic groups gathered at the Jingxi Hotel this afternoon to participate in a Spring Festival gala organized jointly by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's United Front Work Department and the State Ethnic Affairs Commission.

Sima Yi·Aimaiti, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and Minister of the State Ethnic Affairs Commission, delivered the first speech. He extended New Year greetings on behalf of the State Ethnic Affairs Commission to all ethnic groups. He said that the Spring Festival is a time for reunion, and today, representatives from dozens of ethnic groups working in various sectors in the capital have gathered together to celebrate the New Year. This itself is a vivid symbol of the great unity and harmony among the various ethnic groups in our country.

He said, "Unity is strength, unity is progress, unity is victory. In the new year, under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Party and the State Council, we will work hard and strive to further develop the cause of ethnic unity and progress, creating a good social environment for rectifying the economic situation, improving economic order, and deepening comprehensive reform."

Yan Mingfu, a member of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and head of the United Front Work Department, said at the meeting that in the past year, China's ethnic minorities have made new progress and gained new experience in reform and construction. These achievements are the result of the joint efforts of people of all ethnic groups who have seriously implemented the Party's line, principles, and policies, adhered to reform and opening up, and promoted unity and progress.

Yan Mingfu pointed out that the ethnic issue is a long-term one. Maintaining national unity, consolidating ethnic equality and unity, and achieving common prosperity among all ethnic groups are major issues concerning the fate of the country. With the deepening of reform and the development of the national economy, new situations and problems have emerged in ethnic relations. In the process of development, the imbalance in economic and cultural development among different regions and ethnic groups has widened.

Yan Mingfu said that with the advancement of modernization, on the one hand, the economic and cultural ties among various ethnic groups are becoming increasingly close, and the relationship of "none can do without the other" is becoming more pronounced; on the other hand, ethnic consciousness, ethnic feelings, and ethnic pride and self-esteem are also becoming stronger. These situations indicate that during the period of reform and construction, the tasks of ethnic work are not lighter but heavier. He hoped that all ethnic minority comrades would make greater contributions in the new year to the development of China's ethnic unity and progress and to the promotion of the common prosperity of all ethnic groups.

Leaders attending the gala today included Vice Chairman of the National People's Congress Standing Committee Saifuding·Aizizi, Liao Hansheng, Fei Xiaotong, and heads of relevant departments of the Central Committee, minority representatives of the National People's Congress in Beijing, minority members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and senior comrades who have long been engaged in ethnic work, as well as prominent figures from various sectors of the minority communities.

The gala featured a performance of wonderful artistic programs by performers.

　　进一步发展民族团结进步事业
    首都各民族代表欢聚迎新春
    阎明复强调要重视新时期的民族工作
    本报北京２月２日讯  记者沈纯、袁建达报道：４００多名各族代表今天下午欢聚在这里的京西宾馆，参加由中共中央统战部和国家民委联合举办的首都各民族春节联欢会。
    全国政协副主席、国家民委主任司马义·艾买提首先致词。他代表国家民委向各民族的同志拜年。他说，春节是团圆的节日，来自首都各条战线上几十个民族的同志们今天欢聚一堂，共庆新春，这本身就是我国各民族大团圆、大团结的生动象征。
    他说，团结就是力量，团结就是进步，团结就是胜利。在新的一年里，我们要在党中央、国务院的领导下，踏实工作，努力奋斗，进一步发展民族团结进步事业，为治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序、全面深化改革创造良好的社会环境。
    中共中央书记处书记、统战部长阎明复在会上说，过去的一年，我国各少数民族在改革和建设中取得了新的进展和新的经验。这些成就的取得，是各族人民认真贯彻党的路线、方针、政策，坚持改革开放，坚持团结进步，共同努力奋斗的结果。
    阎明复指出，民族问题是长期的。维护祖国统一，巩固民族平等和民族团结，实现各民族共同繁荣，是关系国家命运的重大问题。随着改革的深化和国民经济的发展，民族关系方面出现了一些新情况和新问题。在发展中，不同地区、不同民族经济文化发展不平衡的状况有所扩大。
    阎明复说，随着现代化进程的发展，一方面，各民族之间的经济、文化联系愈来愈密切，“谁也离不开谁”的关系愈来愈发展；另一方面，民族意识、民族感情、民族自尊心和自豪感也愈来愈增强。这些情况表明，在改革和建设时期，民族工作的任务不是减轻了，而是加重了。他希望各位少数民族人士在新的一年里，为发展我国的民族团结进步事业，为促进各民族的共同繁荣作出更大的贡献。
    出席今天联欢会的领导同志还有全国人大常委会副委员长赛福鼎·艾则孜、廖汉生、费孝通以及中央有关部委的负责人，全国人大在京少数民族代表，全国政协在京少数民族委员和长期从事民族工作的老同志，少数民族各界知名人士等。
    联欢会上，文艺工作者演出了精采的文艺节目。
