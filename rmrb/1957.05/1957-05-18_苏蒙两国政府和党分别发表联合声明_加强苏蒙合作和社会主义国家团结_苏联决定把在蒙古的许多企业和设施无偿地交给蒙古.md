Xinhua News Agency, May 17th dispatch from Moscow via TASS: The joint Soviet-Mongolian statement signed in Moscow on May 15th announced that, in the spirit of the declaration of October 30th last year and in the interests of further strengthening Soviet-Mongolian cooperation, the Soviet government has decided to transfer the various enterprises of the "Mongol Petroleum" Trust, the buildings and equipment of the Ulan Bator and Sainshand airports, as well as a number of aircraft, to the Mongolian People's Republic without compensation. The two governments reached an agreement to transfer the Soviet shares in the "Sovmongolmetal" joint-stock company to the Mongolian People's Republic on preferential terms. The government of the Mongolian People's Republic will repay the value of the Soviet shares over thirty years, without interest, starting from 1962. The statement pointed out that the Soviet Union will provide economic and scientific-technical assistance in the implementation of the Mongolian People's Republic's Three-Year Plan (1958-1960). To pay for the equipment, machinery, materials, and other technical assistance supplied by the Soviet Union, the Soviet government will grant the government of the Mongolian People's Republic a loan of 200 million rubles on preferential terms.

The statement said: The foundation of Soviet-Mongolian relations is the principle of Leninism's proletarian internationalism, fraternal mutual assistance, and comprehensive cooperation. The Treaty of Friendship, Mutual Assistance, and Economic and Cultural Cooperation concluded between the two countries in 1946 has special significance for the development of the Mongolian People's Republic along the socialist path. The two governments stated that the successful development of the People's Republic of China and the fraternal relations between the Soviet Union, China, and Mongolia have created more favorable conditions for Mongolia's socialist construction and its peaceful development. The two major fraternal neighbors guarantee the peace and stability of the Mongolian People's Republic's borders.

Economic cooperation between the Soviet Union and Mongolia is developing smoothly. In the past ten years, the Soviet Union has granted Mongolia long-term loans of more than 900 million rubles on preferential terms and, at its request, has transferred Soviet property worth more than 100 million rubles to the Mongolian People's Republic without compensation. Currently, the Mongolian People's Republic is carrying out the construction of eighteen industrial, agricultural, and municipal engineering projects with the help of the Soviet Union.

Referring to the international situation, the joint statement pointed out the importance of disarmament and the cessation of nuclear weapons testing, and considered that the plan for the stationing of American atomic forces on the territory of other countries deepens the danger of atomic war.

The statement said that the government of the Mongolian People's Republic welcomes the restoration of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Japan and declared that it is ready to hold negotiations with the Japanese government on the normalization of relations between the two countries.

The statement pointed out that ignoring the legitimate right of the Mongolian People's Republic to become a member of the United Nations is incompatible with the principles of the Charter of that international organization. The two governments stated that the restoration of the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations is urgently necessary.

The statement emphasized that continuously strengthening the friendship of socialist countries has special significance in the current international situation. The results of recent talks between the governments and Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries demonstrate the further strengthening of the unbreakable unity of the entire socialist camp.

Xinhua News Agency, May 17th dispatch from TASS: A statement issued by the delegations of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, signed in Moscow on May 15th, stated that the two parties' views on all the issues involved in the talks are in complete agreement. Both sides believe that the primary task of the two parties at present is to strengthen the unity of the socialist countries and to fight for the purity of Marxist-Leninist ideology.

The statement said that the delegation of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party pointed out that the resolutions of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union have been unanimously endorsed by the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and have had a great influence on all its activities. The delegation of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union pointed out the significance of Mongolia's experience in building socialism, especially for backward and underdeveloped countries. This experience convincingly proves that Lenin's prediction has been realized in practice, that is, after the laboring people of backward countries have seized power, they can, with the assistance and support of socialist countries, skip the stage of capitalist development and victoriously realize the transition to socialism.

The delegation of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party emphasized in the statement that the Mongolian People's Republic has been able to achieve great achievements in socialist construction thanks to the comprehensive assistance and support of the Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries. Both sides noted with great satisfaction that the victory of the Chinese People's Revolution has not only greatly promoted the development of the liberation struggle of Eastern countries and the course of world history, but has also had a beneficial impact on the situation in the Mongolian People's Republic. The establishment of the People's Republic of China has created new and more favorable conditions and possibilities for the socialist construction of the Mongolian People's Republic.

The two party delegations believe that it is the most important task of the two parties to strengthen the unity of the socialist countries, to fight tirelessly for the purity of Marxist-Leninist ideology, to oppose all kinds of revisionism and bourgeois nationalism, and to further unite the Communist and Workers' Parties on the great Marxist-Leninist principles. Both sides believe that it is their sacred duty to educate their people in the spirit of loyalty to proletarian internationalism, in the spirit of respect for the sovereignty and independence of the people of all countries, large and small, and in strict adherence to complete equality in relations between countries.

    加强苏蒙合作和社会主义国家团结
    苏联决定把在蒙古的许多企业和设施无偿地交给蒙古
    据新华社17日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：5月15日在莫斯科签字的苏联和蒙古人民共和国联合声明宣布，苏联政府本着去年10月30日宣言的精神和根据进一步加强苏蒙两国的合作的利益，决定把“蒙古石油”托辣斯的各个企业、乌兰巴托和赛音沙达飞机场的建筑物和设备以及若干飞机无偿地交给蒙古人民共和国。两国政府达成协议，把苏联在“苏蒙金属”股份公司的股份以优惠条件转让给蒙古人民共和国，蒙古人民共和国政府将自1962年开始，不付利息在三十年内偿清苏联股份的价值。声明指出，在蒙古人民共和国实现三年计划（1958—1960年）方面，苏联将给予经济和科学技术援助。为支付苏联供应的设备、机器、材料和其他技术援助，苏联政府将以优惠条件给予蒙古人民共和国政府为数两亿卢布的贷款。
    声明说：苏蒙关系的基础是列宁主义无产阶级国际主义、兄弟互助和全面合作的原则。两国在1946年缔结的友好互助条约和经济文化合作协定，对蒙古人民共和国沿着社会主义道路发展具有特别的意义。两国政府声明，中华人民共和国的成功的发展和苏、中、蒙之间的兄弟关系，为蒙古的社会主义建设，为它的和平发展创造了更加有利的条件。两大兄弟邻国保障着蒙古人民共和国国境的和平和安定。
    苏蒙两国之间的经济合作正在顺利发展。在最近十年内，苏联以优惠条件给予了蒙古为数九亿卢布以上的长期贷款，并且根据请求把价值一亿卢布以上的苏联财产无偿地交给了蒙古人民共和国。目前，蒙古人民共和国在苏联的帮助下，正在进行十八个工业、农业和市政工程项目的建设。
    在谈到国际形势的时候，联合声明指出了裁军和停止试验核武器的重要性，并且认为，美国原子部队驻扎在别国领土的计划加深了原子战争的危险。
    声明说，蒙古人民共和国政府欢迎苏联和日本恢复外交关系，并且声明，它准备同日本政府就两国关系正常化问题举行谈判。
    声明指出，忽视蒙古人民共和国成为联合国会员国的合法权利，是同这一国际组织的章程的原则不相容的。两国政府声明，恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法权利是迫切必要的。
    声明强调说，不断加强社会主义各国的友谊，在目前国际局势下，具有特别的意义。最近社会主义各国政府和共产党和工人党之间举行的一些会谈的结果，表明了整个社会主义阵营牢不可破的团结的进一步加强。
    新华社17日讯　据塔斯社报道：15日在莫斯科签署的苏联共产党和蒙古人民革命党代表团声明说，两党对会谈所涉及的一切问题的看法是完全一致的。双方认为，为加强社会主义国家的团结、为了马克思列宁主义思想的纯洁性而斗争，是两党目前的首要任务。
    声明说，蒙古人民革命党代表团指出，苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的决议受到蒙古人民革命党的一致赞同，并且对它的全部活动起了很大影响。苏联共产党代表团指出了蒙古建设社会主义的经验的意义，特别是对落后和不发达国家的意义。这个经验令人信服地证明，列宁的预见在实践中实现了，这个预见就是落后国家劳动人民在掌握政权以后，依靠社会主义国家的援助和支持，能够跳过资本主义的发展阶段而胜利地实现到社会主义的过渡。
    蒙古人民革命党代表团在声明中着重指出，蒙古人民共和国之所以能够在社会主义建设方面取得巨大成就，这是同苏联、中国和其他社会主义国家的全面援助和支持分不开的。双方非常满意地指出，中国人民革命的胜利，不仅大大促进了东方国家解放斗争的发展和全世界历史的进程，同时对蒙古人民共和国的状况也起了良好的影响。中华人民共和国的建立给蒙古人民共和国的社会主义建设创造了新的、更为有利的条件和可能性。
    两党代表团认为，为加强社会主义国家的团结，为马克思列宁主义思想的纯洁性，为反对各种修正主义和资产阶级民族主义表现，为共产党和工人党在伟大的马克思列宁主义原则上进一步团结而进行不懈的斗争，是两党最重要的任务。双方认为，用忠于无产阶级国际主义的精神、用尊重大小各国人民的主权和独立的精神以及严格遵守各国关系中完全平等的精神来教育本国人民是自己的神圣职责。
