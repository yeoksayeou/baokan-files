Title: An Account of a Waiter

I am a restaurant waiter at the Qianmen Hotel in Beijing.

Last year, before graduating from junior high school, I studied the lesson "We Are the Successors." The meaning of this lesson is very profound, and the language is very vivid. When the teacher taught this lesson, he said that the socialist construction of the motherland needed many people, and hoped that students over the age of sixteen would participate in work as much as possible. That day, I asked the school to remove my name from the list of those being recommended to higher schools, and decided not to continue my education. At that time, I wholeheartedly wanted to be a textile worker, to be the second Hao Jianxiu. I thought textile workers were the most glorious.

After graduating from junior high school, I didn't find a job in a textile factory, so I signed up to take the exam to be a waiter at the Qianmen Hotel, and I was accepted.

In the old society, hotel waiters were looked down upon, just like those working in bathhouses and barbershops. This situation still has an impact today. Isn't that right? When I decided to come to work at the hotel, my aunt opposed it (my mother had passed away, and my father taught opera in a Peking Opera troupe in the Northeast, so I lived with my aunt). She said a lot of unpleasant things. She said that being a waitress was not glorious, that it was just serving people, being subservient and without prospects, and so on. Later, the neighbors persuaded her, and I also told her the little bit of reasoning I understood. As time went on, my aunt gradually changed her mind. Now, she is very good to me and often encourages me to work hard and study hard. She has realized that hospitality work is as glorious as other labor.

I have been working at the Qianmen Hotel for almost a year. How many guests have we received this year? It's hard to calculate at once. Not counting domestic guests, we have received friends from more than sixty countries, before and after. We have thought of many ways to make our Chinese and foreign guests feel comfortable. The guests respect our labor very much. Some guests have become friends with our waiters, giving us a lot of encouragement in our work and strengthening our confidence. Recently, the Soviet musician Comrade Galiyeva, who came to our country with the Soviet Kazakhstan National Kurmangazy Folk Orchestra, has become a very good friend of mine.

Over the past year, thanks to the help of leaders and comrades, I have further realized the importance of service work in socialist construction. The idea of wanting to be a textile worker wholeheartedly in the past, of wanting to be the second Hao Jianxiu, was not entirely correct. In such a big country as ours, it would be impossible for everyone to pick and choose their jobs, and refuse to do what doesn't suit them. The idea that only textile workers are glorious in the past is not right. Any labor in socialism is equally glorious. Recently, I have seen many young people participating in agricultural production in newspapers and magazines, which is certainly a very glorious thing. We humans are living treasures. People have to eat every day, so food has become the treasure of treasures. Who can say that the people who produce the treasure of treasures are not glorious?

People who produce the treasure of treasures, textile workers, and waiters are all indispensable to building socialism, and they are all glorious labor. Although I am an ordinary waiter, I have my own ideals. I am determined to strive to be a glorious member of the Communist Youth League and a Communist Party member, to work actively in my post for a lifetime, and to constantly learn from my comrades and improve my working ability. I will never be complacent because I have received several awards, and I will never allow the glorious title of waiter to be adversely affected. (Attached picture)

    一个服务员的自述
    我是北京前门饭店餐厅服务员。
    去年，高小毕业前，我曾经读过“我们是接班人”的一课。这课书的意思特别大，语句也很生动。老师在讲这一课的时候，说到祖国社会主义建设需要许多人，希望十六岁以上的同学，最好参加工作。这一天，我就向学校提出要求：把自己的名字，从保送名单中勾掉，决定不再升学。当时，我是一心一意想做一个纺织工人，想做郝建秀的第二。我认为纺织工人最光荣。
    高小毕业以后，没有找到纺织厂的工作，就报名考前门饭店服务员，被录取了。
    旧社会里，饭店服务员同浴室、理发馆等工作一样的受人看不起。这种情形，到今天也还有影响。可不是吗，当我决心来饭店工作的时候，大妈就反对（我母亲已经去世，父亲在东北的一个京剧团里教戏，所以我便住在大妈家里）。她说了一大堆不好听的话。说什么当女招待不光彩，专门伺候人，低三下四没出息等等。后来街坊们劝她，我也将所懂的一点道理说给她听。日子久了，大妈也就渐渐地转变过来了。现在，她对我很好，常常鼓励我好好工作、努力学习。她已经认识到招待工作和其它劳动是一样光荣的。
    我在前门饭店工作快一年了。这一年里，我们接待了多少宾客呢？一下子算不清。国内的不算，光国外的，前前后后就接待过六十多个国家的朋友。我们招待中外宾客，都想了许多办法，使客人们感到舒服。客人对我们的劳动是很尊重的。有的客人同我们服务员交上了朋友，给我们工作上许多鼓励，增强了我们的工作信心。最近随苏联哈萨克斯坦国立库尔曼喀则民间乐队来我国的苏联音乐家加里也娃同志，和我就成为很好的朋友了。
  一年来，由于领导和同志们的帮助，自己进一步认识了服务工作在社会主义建设中的重要意义。过去一心要当纺织工人，要当第二个郝建秀的想法，是不完全对的。我们这么大一个国家，每个人做工作都要挑一挑，不合自己胃口的就不干，那是行不通的。过去认为只有纺织工人才光荣的看法，是不对的。社会主义的任何劳动，都是同样光荣的。最近，从报纸上杂志上，看到许多青年人参加农业生产，这当然是很光荣的事。我们人，是活宝。人，每天都要吃饭，因此粮食就成了宝中宝。谁还能说生产宝中宝的人不光荣呢？
  生产宝中宝的人、纺织工人、服务员，都是建设社会主义不能缺少的，都是光荣的劳动。我虽然是一个普通的服务员，但是有自己的理想。我决心争取做一个光荣的青年团员、共产党员，在自己岗位上，积极的工作一辈子，不断地向同志们学习，提高工作能力。我决不因为受过几次奖励而自满，使光荣的服务员称号受到坏的影响。（附图片）
