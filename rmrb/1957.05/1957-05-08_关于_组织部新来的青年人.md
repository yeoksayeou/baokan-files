    On "The Young Man Newly Arrived at the Organization Department"
  　Wang Meng
    Recently, the short story I wrote, "The Young Man Newly Arrived at the Organization Department," has stirred up debate and received a lot of criticism. Most of this criticism has offered correct and beneficial opinions, educating the author. I deeply appreciate the importance of criticism and self-criticism: a work needs criticism like flowers and trees need sunshine and rain. I appreciate the Party and comrades' close concern for creative work, their strict demands, and their enthusiastic protection. I want to express my comrade-like gratitude to the seniors and friends who have helped me avoid going astray.
    When I first wrote "The Young Man Newly Arrived at the Organization Department," I had two purposes in mind: one was to write about several characters with shortcomings, exposing some negative phenomena in our work and life; the other was to raise a question: where should young people like Lin Zhen, who actively oppose bureaucracy but often get battered and bruised in "struggle," go?
    There are some aspects of the characters I wrote and their entanglements that I can feel and convey, but not clearly analyze and evaluate. When writing this short story, I held the feeling of raising some questions, while also acknowledging with shame that I failed to resolve these questions well.
    The author's subjective attitude is: in life, especially in this Hemp Mill incident, to blame Liu Shiwu's "philosophy" and support Lin Zhen's "basic spirit." However, I felt at the time that it was difficult to fully demonstrate these points in the work.
    I didn't want to write Lin Zhen as a Nastya-style hero. Life has suggested to me more than once the existence of Lin Zhen-type characters who are enthusiastically drawn to Nastya but also have considerable differences from her, Lin Zhen-style "struggles," and Lin Zhen-style setbacks. Frankly, I feel that Nastya's character seems somewhat idealized, and her victories seem somewhat easy. I even wanted to show through Lin Zhen's experience that a young intellectual who transplants the "Nastya method" to China, which has its own national characteristics, and applies it to resolving intra-Party contradictions, often will not succeed. Life's struggles are more complex than what Lin Zhen read in "Tractor Station Director and Chief Agronomist." I knew somewhat in principle that Lin Zhen was not worth emulating. When a friend, after reading the story, expressed the desire to learn from Lin Zhen, I wrote a letter to dissuade him. However, the effect the work had was a non-critical beautification, fondness, and sympathy for Lin Zhen and Zhao Huiwen. Similarly, the work did not instill a reservation or questioning about the "Nastya method" Lin Zhen understood, but instead blindly promoted it.
    How did this happen? Once a character is written on paper by the author, they become an "objective existence" that does not depend on the author's subjective will; otherwise, the character will not "come alive." When a character like Lin Zhen "comes alive" in front of the author, it is a test of the author's thinking: can one clearly, comprehensively, and appropriately understand, evaluate, and portray one's characters? Can one, through the handling of this character, promote correct, proletarian ideas?
    The author did not withstand this test. Because in the depths of the author's heart, there still existed things "in common" with Lin Zhen—they are fantasies about the "simple and transparent" nature of life, a taste for the self-admiration and fanaticism of petty-bourgeois intellectuals, a dislike of "sentimentality" but also using sentimentality to decorate one's "spiritual world," and so on—and because the author abandoned the effort to consciously evaluate their characters; therefore, contrary to the author's original intention, the author delved into the hearts of Lin and Zhao, only to experience their joys, sorrows, and angers, rendering their emotions in a flamboyant manner, complaining on their behalf... Unable to control them, the author became a prisoner of their thoughts and feelings.
    The author did not stand higher than his characters but descended (I say descended, because in work and life, the author and Lin and Zhao-style characters still have boundaries) to the same level as his characters.
    In this way, a bad influence was created.
    On the side opposed to Lin Zhen, Liu Shiwu is the main character. I focused not on how he was "bureaucratic" in his work (some descriptions are not necessarily suitable to be simply categorized under the concept of bureaucracy), but on his "that's just how it is" state of mind. Many comrades have analyzed the reasons for Liu Shiwu's formation. Besides agreeing with some of their views, I feel that the reason Liu Shiwu became Liu Shiwu is also because he became divorced from the masses and from life. When he—an intellectual-born, capable Communist Party member—had not yet received sufficient training in the struggles of the masses, had not yet established a flesh-and-blood connection with the masses, and had not yet become an outstanding member of the masses and the class, he ran "above" the masses and became a cadre who leads the masses, educates the class, and "creates" life. In fact, cadres are not only there to educate others; they also need to absorb nourishment and strength from the masses and from life. What Liu Shiwu doesn't understand is precisely this point. How could such a Liu Shiwu not experience "waning enthusiasm"?
    The occupational disease that Liu Shiwu mentioned, albeit in a distorted way, was written about in an attempt to illustrate this point. However, because I didn't think clearly enough at the time, it wasn't written clearly either. And Lin Zhen's contrast and Zhao Huiwen's foil further blurred the meaning of this passage, even giving a ridiculous impression.
    As for Liu Shiwu's work, in many places, he is correct and respectable, and I don't "detest" him at all. It is a pity that he uses his mastery of the laws of work to protect and conceal his indifference. His strengths and weaknesses are connected. Lin Zhen could not understand and analyze Liu Shiwu clearly. Lin Zhen initially respected Liu Shiwu, then became bewildered, and later wanted to oppose him in a sweeping way, but in opposing him, he lacked confidence and often fell into ideological confusion. As mentioned earlier, since the author was, in a sense, tagging along with Lin Zhen, and since the criticism of Liu Shiwu in the work was mainly through the mouths of Lin and Zhao, this criticism could not help but be somewhat vague and unconvincing.
    The entanglement between Lin Zhen and Zhao Huiwen and Liu Shiwu and Han Changxin is composed of several factors: among them, there are the not-entirely practical and endearingly idealistic fantasies of young people who are initially embarking on life. There is the serious attitude towards life of young people, the influence of Nastya, the naiveté and one-sidedness of youth, and the petty-bourgeois intellectuals' cherishing and defense of their naiveté and one-sidedness. There is the petty-bourgeois fastidiousness, self-righteousness, and detachment from the collective, unhealthy sentimentality; there is the maturity and sophistication of comrades who have done some leadership work, and the coldness and decline masked by this sophistication, a new philistinism, the complacent slackening of turning avoidable shortcomings into inevitable ones, and also the neurotic lamenting of certain unavoidable shortcomings (or even non-shortcomings)... What a complex life! What complex and different viewpoints, thoughts, and "emotional currents"! The author did not strive to rely on the ideological brilliance of Marxism-Leninism to illuminate his course, but was instead submerged in the ocean of viewpoints, thoughts, and emotional currents. When writing about all this, the author felt how chaotic and difficult to control it all was! Even, he was unable to arrange an ending for his short story...
    So many factors were written about, why not write about positive factors that are enough to inspire people and give them direction, besides some weak descriptions of the atmosphere?
    Is it because the author cannot see or does not believe in the powerful and inspiring positive forces in our lives? No.
    The author simply did not bother to think about the issue of writing about positive factors. He felt that the short story was limited in length, and everyone has their own division of labor. This one should be assigned to writing about shortcomings, about the entanglements that headache the author! As for what effect this would have, it was not considered. The author also vaguely felt that if he wrote about positive factors, because the description of positive factors would have to set off the correct, clear, and forceful analysis and criticism of various negative factors, the task would be much more difficult. The author vaguely felt his own "inability to handle it," so he bypassed the positive factors.
    When writing this short story, the author had an isolated and one-sided view of the truth of life, a kind of "superstition."
    The author excessively believed in his artistic sense. He thought that relying on this artistic sense to faithfully and boldly reproduce the various characters and contradictions in life was the best thing to do for readers. He thought that since life is richer and more vivid than theory, and since not all contradictions in life have been analyzed by Marxist classic writers and the Party Central Committee, then the author might as well not analyze them clearly either, but boldly write about the truth, write the truth out, and let the readers draw conclusions! Perhaps there is some truth to what is said here, but the author has thus derived some wrong ideas: the author thought that having the truth of life necessarily meant having the socialist spirit, but in fact, he didn't consciously pursue the socialist spirit; he thought that having realistic artistic feelings could replace the proletarian stand, viewpoint, and method, as if that was only needed when writing policy papers and not when writing short stories; he thought that reflecting life would definitely educate readers, but in fact, he didn't consciously comment on life and educate the masses. The author is firmly opposed to separating the socialist spirit from the truth of life, and opposed to the "educational significance" added to the work. But therefore, the author fell into another kind of one-sidedness, only wanting the "truth of life" and not the socialist spirit. In fact, this is precisely separating the socialist spirit from the truth of life, and isolatingly "sanctifying" the "truth of life."
    Without the consciousness of Marxism and without the ideological weapon, is it possible to reproduce the truth of life more "without restraint"? No, the painful lesson has given me a hundred no's! No writer is a cold, mirror-like reflector of the truth of life. Whether consciously or unconsciously, the writer is always judging life and revealing his loves and hates in his works. Moreover, even if the author repeatedly declares that he has no "subjective attitude," readers can still keenly feel your ideological tendencies, whether they are clear or vague. There is no such thing as the truth of life suspended in mid-air. What exists is only the "truth of life" that is understood and felt by the thoughts and emotions of a certain class or group in society. (Of course, the understanding and feeling of life also depend on personal psychological, personality, and interest-related factors.) When the conscious and powerful ideological weapon of Marxism-Leninism is disarmed, the spontaneous, hidden petty-bourgeois (or other erroneous) thoughts and emotions will play a role. This role, precisely and lamentably, damages the truth of life.
    Lenin wrote in 1915: "Man's knowledge is not a straight line (nor does it proceed along a straight line), but infinitely approximates a series of circles, approximating a spiral curve. Any fragment, piece, small section of this curve can be turned (one-sidedly turned) into an independent and complete straight line, and this straight line can lead people (if they only see the trees and not the forest) into a mire, ... (where the class interests of the ruling class will consolidate it.)" (Philosophical Notebooks, p. 365: On the Question of Dialectics)
    Isn't literary creation like this? On the tortuous path of image thinking, any fork in the road can lead you astray, leading the tendency of the entire work astray. I must study theory well, study to recognize life objectively, comprehensively, and deeply; I must overcome petty-bourgeois thoughts and emotions. Not only the "interests of the ruling class," but all non-proletarian thoughts and emotions will play a "consolidating" role in erroneous and one-sided understanding.

    关于“组织部新来的青年人”
  　王蒙
    最近一个时期，我写的小说“组织部新来的青年人”引起了争论，受到了不少批评；这些批评大多数都提出了正确的、有益的意见，教育了作者。我深深体会到批评与自我批评的重要：作品需要批评，就像花木需要阳光雨露似的；我体会到党和同志们对于创作的亲切关怀，严格要求，与热忱保护，我要向帮助自己免于走上歧路的前辈和朋友表示同志的谢意。
    最初写“组织部新来的青年人”时，想到了两个目的：一是写几个有缺点的人物，揭露我们工作、生活中的一些消极现象，一是提出一个问题，像林震这样的积极反对官僚主义却又常在“斗争”中碰得焦头烂额的青年到何处去。
    我写的几个人物和他们的纠葛，有一些地方虽然能够感受、传达，却不能清楚地分析、评价，写这篇小说时，我是抱着一种提出若干问题，同时惭愧地承认自己未能将这些问题很好地解决的心情的。
    作者的主观态度是：在生活里，特别在这一麻袋厂事件中，责备刘世吾的“哲学”，支持林震的“基本精神”，更多的，我当时觉得是难以在作品中一一论证了。
    我不想把林震写成娜斯嘉式的英雄。生活不止一次地提示给我热情向往娜斯嘉又与娜斯嘉有相当区别的林震式的人物，林震式的“斗争”，林震式的受挫。老实讲，我觉得娜斯嘉的性格似乎理想化了些，她的胜利也似乎容易了些。甚至于，我还想通过林震的经历显示一下：一个知识青年，把“娜斯嘉方式”照搬到自有其民族特点的中国，应用于解决党内矛盾，往往不会成功，生活斗争是比林震从“拖拉机站站长和总农艺师”里读到的更复杂的。从道理上，我多少知道林震是不值得效法的，当一个朋友看了小说表示要向林震学习时，我曾写信劝阻他。但是作品所引起的效果，却是对于林震以及赵慧文的无批判的美化、爱抚和同情。同样的，作品给人的不是对于林震所了解的“娜斯嘉方式”的保留、质疑，而是盲目鼓吹。
    这是怎么搞的？人物一经作者写在纸上，就成为不依作者的主观的意志为转移的“客观存在”，否则，人物就“活”不起来。当林震这样的人物“活”在作者的面前时，就是对于作者的思想的一个考验：能不能清醒地、全面地、恰如其分地理解、评价与表现自己的人物？能不能通过对于这一人物的处理，宣扬正确的、无产阶级的思想？
    作者没有经得起这一考验。由于作者的心灵深处还存在着一些与林震“相通”的东西——它们是对于生活的“单纯透明”的幻想，对于小资产阶级知识分子的孤芳自赏、与狂热心理的玩味，不喜欢“伤感”却又以伤感点缀自己的“精神世界”等等，又由于作者放弃了自觉地评价自己人物的努力；——于是，违背了作者的初衷，作者钻到林、赵的心里，一味去体验他们的喜怒哀乐，渲染地表现他们的情绪，替他们诉苦……，掌握不住他们，反而，成为他们的思想感情的俘虏。
    作者没有站得比自己的人物更高，却降得（我说降得，因为在工作、生活里作者与林、赵式的人物还是有界限的）和自己的人物一般低。
    这样，就发生了不好的影响。
    在与林震对立的一方，刘世吾是主要人物，我着重写的不是他工作中怎样“官僚主义”（有些描写也不见得宜于简单地列入官僚主义的概念之下），而是他的“就那么回事”的精神状态。形成刘世吾的原因许多同志已经作了分析，除了同意他们的一些看法以外，我觉得刘世吾所以成为刘世吾，还在于他脱离了群众、脱离了生活。当他——一个知识分子出身的、精明强干的共产党员，还没有在群众斗争中受到足够的锻炼、还没有与群众建立血肉联系，还没有成为群众中、阶级中一个优秀分子的时候，就跑到群众“上面”，变成领导群众、教育阶级、“缔造”生活的干部了。其实，干部也不是光教育人家的，他更需要从群众中、生活中吸取营养和力量，刘世吾所不懂的正是这一点。这样的刘世吾，怎么会不“热情衰退”呢？
    刘世吾不无歪曲地讲到的职业病，所以被我写到，就是试图说明这一点。但是由于当时想的不太清楚，写的也不清楚。而林震的对照，赵慧文的衬托，更使这一段描写的意思含混不清，甚至会给人一种荒唐的印象。
    至于刘世吾在工作上，不少地方是正确的、可敬的，我一点也不“憎恶”他。可惜，他运用自己对于工作规律的掌握来保护、掩盖自己的冷漠，他的优点和缺点是联系着的。林震是不可能了解和分析清楚刘世吾的，林震对刘世吾初而尊敬，继而惶惑，后来就要笼统反对了，反对当中却又没有把握，常常陷于思想混乱之中。像前面提到的，作者既然在某种意义上作了林震的尾巴，作品对于刘世吾的批判既然主要是通过林、赵的嘴巴，这种批判就不能不是有些含混的、说服力不够的。
    林震、赵慧文与刘世吾、韩常新的纠葛是被好几个因素组成的：其中有最初走向生活的青年人的不尽切合实际的、不无可爱的幻想。有青年人的认真的生活态度、娜斯嘉的影响，有青年的幼稚性、片面性和小资产阶级知识分子对自己的幼稚性、片面性的珍视和保卫，有小资产阶级的洁癖、自命清高与脱离集体，有不健康的多愁善感；有作了一些领导工作的同志的成熟、老练，有在这种老练掩护下的冷漠、衰退，有新的市侩主义，有把可以避免的缺点说成不可避免的苟且松懈，也有对于某些不可避免的缺点（甚至不是缺点）的神经质的慨叹……多么复杂的生活！多么复杂的各不相同的观点、思想与“情绪波流”！作者没有努力依靠马克思列宁主义的思想光辉照亮自己的航路，却在这观点、思想、情绪波流组成的大海中淹没了。在写到这一切的时候，作者曾经感到头绪多么纷乱，多么难以驾驭呀！甚至，他无法给自己的小说安排一个结尾呢……
    许许多多的因素都写到了，为什么不写出足以给人鼓舞，给人方向的积极因素呢，除了某些气氛的无力的描写以外？
    是不是由于作者看不见，不相信我们生活中的强大的、振奋人心的积极力量呢？否。
    作者根本没有用心想一想写出积极因素的问题，他觉得小说篇幅有限，各有分工，这一篇就分工写缺点吧，写令作者感到头痛的纠葛吧！至于这样会产生什么效果，没有考虑。作者还隐约感到，如果一写积极因素，由于通过积极因素的描写，就必须反衬出对于种种消极因素的正确的、清醒的、有力的分析和批判，那任务就会艰巨得多，作者隐约感到自己的“力不胜任”，于是就把积极因素绕开了。
    在写这一篇小说的时候，作者对于生活真实，有一种孤立的、片面的看法，有一种“迷信”。
    作者过分地相信自己的艺术感觉，他以为，靠这种艺术感觉，忠实地、大胆地再现生活当中的形形色色的人物和矛盾，就是为读者作了最好的事情。他以为，既然生活比理论更丰富，更生动，既然生活当中的一切矛盾未必都经过马克思主义经典作家和党中央的分析，那么作者就更未必分析得清楚，还是大胆地去写真实吧，把真实写出来，让读者去作结论吧，也许，话说到这里还有一些道理，但是作者却由此引伸了一些错误的想法：作者以为有了生活真实就一定有了社会主义精神，其实是不去自觉地追求社会主义精神；以为有了现实的艺术感受就可以替代无产阶级的立场、观点、方法，似乎那只是写政策论文的时候才需要，写小说的时候用不上；以为反映了生活就一定能教育读者，其实是不去自觉地评论生活，教育群众。作者是坚决反对把社会主义精神与生活真实隔裂开来的，反对作品中外加的“教育意义”的。但因此作者陷于另一种片面性中，只要“生活真实”，不要社会主义精神，其实，这也正是把社会主义精神与生活真实隔裂开，把“生活真实”孤立地“圣化”起来。
    离开了马克思主义的自觉，解除了思想武器，能够更“没有拘束”地再现出生活真实么？不，痛切的教训给了我一百个不！任何作家，都不是冷冰冰地镜子般地反映生活真实的，不管自觉与否，作家总是在作品中评判着生活、流露着爱憎，而且，即使作者一再声明自己并无“主观态度”，读者仍然可以敏锐地感到你的或鲜明、或模糊的思想倾向。半悬空中的生活真实是没有的，有的只是被社会的一定的阶级或集团的思想情绪所理解、感受的“生活真实”。（当然，对于生活的理解和感受，也还取决于个人的心理、性格、趣味方面的因素。）当自觉的、强有力的马列主义的思想武器被解除了之后，自发的、隐藏着的小资产阶级（或其他错误的）思想情绪就要起作用了，这种作用，恰恰可悲地损害了生活的真实。
    列宁在1915年写道：“人的认识不是直线（也不是沿着直线进行的），而是无限地近似于一串圆圈、近似于螺旋的曲线。这一曲线的任何一个片断、碎片、小段都能被变成（被片面地变成）独立的完整的直线，而这条直线能把人们（如果只见树木不见森林的话）引到泥坑里去，……（在那里统治阶级的阶级利益就会把它巩固起来。）”（哲学笔记365页：谈谈辩证法问题）
    文学创作不就是这样么？在形象思维的曲折道路上，任何一个岔道都可以把你引入迷途，把整个作品的倾向引入迷途。我必须好好地学习理论，学习客观地、全面地、深刻地认识生活；必须克服小资产阶级的思想情绪，不仅“统治阶级的利益”，一切非无产阶级的思想情绪，都会对错误的、片面的认识起“巩固”作用呢。
