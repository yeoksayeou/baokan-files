    Should Organize Unified Construction
    By our reporter Gu Lei
    Thinking of saving before the project starts
    In early 1954, the state decided to build many large industries in Lanzhou, including an oil refinery, a petroleum machinery equipment factory, a fertilizer factory, a rubber factory, a thermal power plant, an oil refining chemical equipment factory, a water plant, the Agan Town coal mine, and huge drainage pipelines, transmission lines, and dedicated railway lines; near Lanzhou, there were also cement plants, non-ferrous metal mines, and some other large factories.
    Because of lack of experience, the Lanzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China faced this arduous task and was initially somewhat nervous, not knowing what problems to pay attention to during the construction process. Therefore, they consulted with Soviet experts who came to Lanzhou to help with surveying and design. One Soviet expert said that the first thing to do is to focus on preparing for construction. In addition to solving the problem of construction water and electricity as soon as possible, it is necessary to comprehensively consider establishing various auxiliary enterprises that can meet construction needs, such as concrete prefabrication plants, cement mixing plants, steel processing plants, machinery repair plants, iron parts processing plants, etc. In terms of urban construction, in addition to speeding up planning, roads and bridges leading to the factory area should be built first.
    The Lanzhou Municipal Committee studied the opinions of the Soviet experts and considered the problem that there were too many construction units in the Lanzhou area. According to the projects that had been determined at that time, the construction teams might include the Ministry of Raw Fuel Industry, the Ministry of Heavy Industry, the Ministry of Construction Engineering, the Ministry of Railways, and various local state-owned construction companies. Moreover, the topography of Lanzhou is very special, sandwiched between two mountains, sixty kilometers long from east to west, and the original urban public utilities infrastructure was very weak. Under these circumstances, each construction unit would definitely put forward more demands on urban construction and would definitely set up its own auxiliary enterprises and various temporary projects. In this way, not only would the urban construction work be unable to cope, but it would also inevitably cause enormous waste. Based on this view, the Municipal Committee made a suggestion to the State Planning Commission and the relevant departments of the central government through various factories: would it be possible for many projects to be constructed by one construction unit?
    The relevant departments accepted this suggestion and decided that the Ministry of Construction Engineering would organize unified construction.
            How to unify?
    How to unify? Lanzhou's approach is:
    First, let the units with larger construction forces uniformly contract for various construction projects of all departments in one or two regions. Regardless of whether it is the construction department of various central ministries or the local construction department, they must give up the projects originally planned to be contracted in this region.
    Second, for some projects outside the urban area, because the construction force of the Lanzhou Construction Engineering General Company is insufficient, or special construction force is needed, or the construction units have already "set up camp," and the proportion of these construction units' projects in the Lanzhou area is not large, they are still constructed by their own forces. For example, the Yongdeng Cement Plant and the Agan Town Coal Mine are still constructed by various units separately.
    Third, some construction units with special characteristics are still allowed to construct independently. For example, the railway construction engineering team responsible for building dedicated lines is technically different from other construction units, and the supply of raw materials is also relatively special, so unified construction is not implemented.
    Fourth, for some provincial and municipal construction units that specialize in contracting civil buildings, because the workload is not large and their activities will not affect the construction order of the entire base, unified construction is not organized either. The method for these units is to roughly divide them into different areas to contract for civil construction tasks in one or two regions, so as to avoid one unit setting up stalls everywhere, lengthening the construction line, and causing waste in material transportation.
    Fifth, after implementing the above measures, the Municipal Committee still felt it was not thorough enough. It is now trying to eliminate various decentralized phenomena, gradually transforming from small unification to large unification, and minimizing the number of construction units.
      What are the benefits of unified construction?
    Most of the major projects and major industrial areas in the Lanzhou area have achieved unified construction. The facts of the past two years have proven that there are many benefits.
    The first benefit: it is possible to comprehensively consider the construction of the base and greatly save the construction costs of various auxiliary enterprises and temporary projects. Taking the Xigu District as an example, if all the projects here were not all constructed by the Lanzhou Engineering General Company of the Ministry of Construction Engineering, several construction units would inevitably set up their own processing auxiliary enterprises, and build their own temporary water sources, water supply, power transmission, roads, parking lots, warehouses, dedicated lines, workers' sheds, and temporary dormitories. According to the facts of many areas in the past, construction units usually calculate the production capacity of auxiliary enterprises and the construction of temporary projects based on the workload and labor required during the peak of construction. After unified construction, the cost of building auxiliary enterprises can be reduced to the minimum extent while ensuring that construction needs are met. For many temporary projects, it is also possible to consider how to use them for a long time. For example, an engineering office built a batch of temporary workers' sheds between the oil refinery, the water plant purification station, and the rubber factory. These workers' sheds can take into account the construction of three projects at the same time. If constructed by three construction units, three sets of workers' sheds would have to be built. It is precisely because the Lanzhou Construction Engineering General Company has contracted many projects that cannot be completed in three or two years, that it can consider building some permanent constructions (such as dormitories, etc.) in the base, and will not be like some construction units that have only worked for one or two years and have to demolish many processing plants and workers' sheds, which is also a great saving.
    The second benefit: centralized and flexible command, able to mobilize manpower and materials in a timely manner to complete the main and key projects in a region. Lanzhou originally had a power plant, but the power generation capacity was very small. Therefore, whether the thermal power station project can be completed as soon as possible determines whether the new factory in Lanzhou can start production smoothly after completion; at the same time, the construction base also urgently needs a new power source. Under these circumstances, in the first half of last year, the Lanzhou Construction Engineering General Company concentrated a considerable part of the construction force, technical personnel, and various materials, and mobilized the main processing auxiliary enterprises to rush the construction of the thermal power station project. If the thermal power station was constructed by another unit, it would not have the power to do so. As for the problems of material exchange, mutual assistance, and mutual support that occur in various regions of the country, they do not exist in the Xigu District. Because, unlike the construction units in other regions that are only responsible for one project, the Lanzhou Construction Engineering General Company is responsible for all projects in a region, and all the construction forces are their own. What happens is only a matter of how to schedule them. This avoids the wrangling that occurs during coordination and is of great significance for ensuring the acceleration of construction speed.
    The third benefit: after unified construction, it is possible to comprehensively arrange the construction progress of major projects in the region, allocate forces at any time, and avoid a large amount of idle work. In the past, many construction units were most afraid of the four words "construction climax," and every project inevitably has a construction climax. In order to ensure that the project is completed on time, the construction unit must organize forces to complete the tasks during the construction climax. At this time, a difficult problem arises: if the forces sufficient to cope with the construction climax are not concentrated, there is a fear that the task will not be completed by then; if the forces are concentrated, there will be idle work. According to the past practice of many construction units, most of them would rather have more people, so as not to be unable to find people when the time comes. However, the Lanzhou Construction Engineering General Company contracts for many major projects in a region, and the construction climaxes of these projects are staggered, so it can arrange the construction plan in a balanced manner, so that there will be no rush work or idle work.
    Fourth, it can better improve the material and cultural life of construction workers. The mobility of construction workers is very high. Especially when various departments construct separately, the time in one area will not be too long. After completing the task, they have to transfer to other areas. Such construction units certainly cannot build a large number of permanent welfare facilities, so it is difficult to improve the living conditions of employees to a large extent. After unified construction, construction workers work in one area for a long time, which not only avoids the hardship of moving, but also has the conditions to build permanent welfare facilities. The Lanzhou Construction Engineering General Company is building a workers' sanatorium and is also preparing to establish an outpatient department, which small or highly mobile construction units cannot do.
        What other wishes do people have?
    Some comrades I have visited have such wishes: in addition to special projects such as railways and coal mines, they hope that the relevant departments of the central government will unify the remaining construction forces as soon as possible, establish regional engineering bureaus or engineering general companies, and uniformly lead all projects in a region by a department of the central government. At the same time, in addition to equipment installation being the responsibility of Party A, this general company (or engineering bureau) should become a complete and powerful construction force with various types of work. It should have its own various auxiliary enterprises and professional construction forces such as electrical installation, pipeline installation, metal structure, and mechanized construction, which are directly led by it rather than by the professional bureau of the ministry. In this way, there is more room for maneuver, and manpower waste can be further avoided, which can save more funds than small unification. They said: "This is the general trend, and it is the road that must be taken. I hope we can take a step earlier!"
    In the process of unified construction in Lanzhou, there are several issues that deserve the attention of relevant departments and various regions.
    1. Using the idea of saving to overcome the idea of only seeking convenience is the ideological foundation for leading unified construction. Some departments do not agree with unified construction. In addition to worrying that others cannot guarantee the completion of the department's project tasks on time, there is also a thought: it is always more convenient to do the work of your own department with your own forces than to contract it out to other departments. The so-called "grain should be grown by oneself, and children should be raised by oneself," "it is better to ask oneself than to ask others." This kind of thinking must be corrected well.
    2. Although small unification is not as good as large unification, unification is always better than no unification. An active attitude should be adopted to unify as much as possible. Large unification involves a wide range and is related to the rational distribution of national construction forces and construction bases. Therefore, it takes a long time to realize large unification. Under these circumstances, we must not wait. We should make the greatest efforts to unify within a region, unifying as many projects as possible, unifying a little to reduce a little waste, and unifying a little more to reduce a little more waste.
    3. The party organization should care about the issue of unified leadership and construction. This care is not business intervention, but to fight against waste. The Lanzhou Municipal Committee attached importance to this issue and saved the country a lot of money.
    The Lanzhou area's experiment proves that unified construction must be organized in new industrial areas, and unified construction can also be organized. I hope that all regions that have not yet organized unified construction can pay full attention to this issue; I also hope that the relevant departments of the central government will further study this issue as soon as possible.

    应该组织统一施工
    本报记者　顾雷
    工程未动工，先想到节省
    1954年初，国家决定在兰州市建设许多大的工业，有炼油厂、石油机械设备厂、肥料厂、橡胶厂、热电站、炼油化工设备厂、自来水厂、阿甘镇煤矿和巨大的排水管道、输电线路、铁路专用线等；在兰州附近还有水泥厂、有色金属矿山和其他一些大工厂。
    因为没有经验，中共兰州市委面临着这个艰巨的任务，一开始精神有些紧张，不知道在建设过程中需要注意些什么问题，于是请教当时到兰州帮助勘测设计的苏联专家。有位苏联专家说，首先应该抓紧施工的准备工作。除了及早解决施工用水、用电的问题外，要全面考虑建立能够满足施工需要的各种附属企业，如混凝土预制品厂、水泥搅拌厂、钢筋加工厂、机具修理厂、铁件加工厂等等。在城市建设方面，除抓紧规划外，应该先把通往厂区的道路、桥梁先修通。
    兰州市委研究了苏联专家的意见，便考虑到兰州地区施工单位太多这个问题。按照当时已确定的工程，施工的队伍可能有原燃料工业部、原重工业部、建筑工程部、铁道部及地方国营的各个建筑公司。而兰州市的地形又很特别，被夹在两个山的中间，东西长六十公里，原有的城市公用事业基础又非常薄弱。在这种情况下，各施工单位一定会向城市建设提出更多的要求，一定会自搞一套附属企业和各种暂设工程。这样，不但使城市建设工作无法应付，也势必造成极大的浪费。基于这种看法，市委便向国家计划委员会并由各厂向中央有关部门提出了一个建议：是否可以把许多工程由一个施工单位施工呢？
    有关部门接受了这个建议，决定由中央建筑工程部组织统一施工。
            怎么统一？
    怎么统一呢？兰州市的做法是：
    第一，让施工力量较大的单位，统一承包一个或两个地区内一切部门的各项建筑工程，无论是中央各部的或地方上的施工部门，都要把原计划在这个地区承包的工程让出来。
    第二，市区以外的某些工程，由于兰州建筑工程总公司的施工力量不够，或者需要特别的施工力量，或者是建筑单位已摆开了“阵势”，而这些施工单位的工程量在兰州地区占的比重也不大，便仍然由各建筑单位自己的力量施工。如：永登水泥厂、阿甘镇煤矿，还是分散由各单位施工。
    第三，对某些特殊性的施工单位，仍然允许他们单独施工。例如负责修筑专用线的铁道建筑工程队伍，技术上不同于其他施工单位，原材料供应也比较特殊，便不实行统一施工。
    第四，对专门承包民用建筑的一些省、市营施工单位，由于工作量不大，他们的活动不会左右整个基地的建设秩序，所以也没有组织统一施工。对于这些单位的办法是，大体上给他们划分不同的范围，承包一个或两个地区的民用建筑任务，以免一个单位到处都摆摊子，拉长了施工线，造成材料运输方面的浪费。
    第五，实行了上述这些办法以后，市委还认为不彻底。现在正设法消除各种分散现象，逐渐由小统一变成大统一，尽量减少施工单位。
      统一施工有哪些好处？
    兰州地区大部分大工程、主要工业区做到了统一施工，两年来的事实证明，好处很多。
    第一个好处：可以全面考虑进行基地的建设，大大节省了各种附属企业、暂设工程的建筑费用。以西固区为例，如果这里的所有工程不是全部由建筑工程部兰州工程总公司施工，势必有好几个施工单位各搞一套加工附属企业，各建各的临时水源、输水、送电、道路、停车场、仓库、专用线、工棚及临时宿舍。根据过去不少地区的事实证明，各施工单位通常是拿工程施工高潮时的工作量和需用的人力，计算附属企业的生产能力和修建暂设工程的。统一施工以后，就可以在保证满足施工需要的条件下，把建筑附属企业的费用压缩到最低限度。对于许多暂设工程，也能够考虑如何长期利用。例如，有一个工程处在炼油厂、自来水厂净化站和橡胶厂之间修建了一批临时工棚，利用这些工棚可以同时兼顾三个工程的施工。如果由三个施工单位施工，就要盖三片工棚。正由于兰州建筑工程总公司承包了许多工程，不是三年两年可以建设完的，便可以考虑在基地里修筑一些永久性的建设（如宿舍等），不会像有些施工单位，只干了一两年，便要拆迁许多加工厂和工棚，这也是一项很大的节省。
    第二个好处：指挥集中、灵活，能够及时调动人力、物力、完成一个地区主要的、重点的工程。兰州市原有个电厂，但发电能力很小，因此电热站工程能否及早竣工，决定了兰州市新工厂建成后能否顺利开始生产；同时建筑基地也迫切需要新的电源。在这种情况下，去年上半年，兰州建筑工程总公司便集中了相当大一部分施工力量、技术人员和各种材料，动员了主要的加工附属企业，突击电热站的工程。如果电热站是由另外一个单位施工，是没有力量这样做的。至于像在全国各地区发生的串换材料、互通有无、相互支援等问题，在西固区是不存在的。因为，兰州建筑工程总公司不像其他地区的施工单位那样只对一个工程负责，他们是对一个地区所有的工程负责，全部施工力量都是自己的，所发生的只是如何调度的问题。这样便避免了配合时发生的扯皮现象，对保证加快建设速度有重要的意义。
    第三个好处：统一施工以后，能够全面地安排地区内各大工程的施工进度，随时调配力量，避免大量窝工。过去，许多施工单位最怕四个字：“施工高潮”，而每个工程又必然有个施工高潮。施工单位为了保证工程按时竣工，必须组织力量完成施工高潮期间的任务。这时，便发生了一个难题：不集中起足以应付施工高潮的力量，怕到时完不成任务；集中了力量，又要发生窝工现象。照过去许多施工单位的做法，大都是宁可人多一些，免得到时候找不到人。而兰州建筑工程总公司承包了一个地区的许多大工程，这些工程的施工高潮又是交错的，就可以均衡地安排施工计划，不致于发生抢工或窝工。
    第四，能够更好地改善建筑工人的物质文化生活。建筑工人的流动性很大。特别是各部门分散施工的时候，在一个地区的时间总不会太久，完成任务后，不得不向别的地区转移。这样的施工单位，当然不能大量建筑永久性的福利设施，因此要在较大程度上改善职工的居住条件是很困难的。统一施工后，建筑工人在一个地区工作的时间很长，不但免除了调动时奔波之苦，也有条件建设永久性的福利设施。兰州建筑工程总公司正在建筑一座职工疗养院，还准备设立门诊部，这是小的或流动性大的施工单位无法做到的。
        人们还有哪些愿望？
    我访问过的一些同志，都有这样的愿望：除了铁路、煤矿等特殊工程外，希望中央有关部门早日把其余的施工力量统一起来，成立地区性的工程局或工程总公司，统一由中央的一个部领导，总包一个地区所有的工程。同时，除了设备安装由甲方负责外，这个总公司（或工程局）应该变成一支完整的、拥有各种工种的强大的施工力量。它要有自己直接领导而不是由部的专业局领导的各种附属企业和电气安装、管道安装、金属结构、机械化施工等专业施工的力量。这样，机动的余地就大，更可以避免人力的浪费，比小统一能节省更多的资金。他们说：“这是大势所趋，是必然要走的路，但愿早走一步才好！”
    在兰州市统一施工的过程中，有几个问题值得有关部门和各地注意。
    一、用节约的思想去战胜只图方便的思想，是统一施工领导的思想基础。有些部门不赞成统一施工，除了顾虑别人无法保证按时完成本部门工程任务外，还有一种想法是：用自己的力量干自己部门的活，总比包给外部门方便。所谓“谷要自种，儿要自养”，“求人不如求己”。这种思想一定要很好地纠正。
    二、虽然小统一不如大统一，但统总比不统好，应该采取能统多少统多少的积极态度。大统一牵扯的面很广，联系到全国建筑力量和建筑基地的合理分布。因此想实现大统一，要费时很久。在这种情况下，万不能等待，应该在一个地区内尽最大的努力去统一，能统几个工程就统几个工程，统一一点少一点浪费，多统一点多减少一些浪费。
    三、党的组织要关怀统一领导施工的问题，这种关怀并不是业务上的干预，而是为了向浪费现象进行斗争。兰州市委重视了这个问题，给国家节省了很多的钱。
    兰州地区的尝试证明：在新工业区必须组织统一的施工，也能够组织统一的施工。希望所有尚未组织统一施工的地区，能够充分注意这个问题；也希望中央有关部门尽快地进一步研究这个问题。
