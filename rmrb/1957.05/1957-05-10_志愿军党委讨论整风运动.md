Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 7th: The Chinese Communist Party's Chinese People's Volunteer Army Committee recently held an expanded meeting to discuss how to study Chairman Mao's speech on the correct handling of contradictions among the people and to carry out the rectification movement. The meeting held that because the Volunteer Army is stationed abroad, contradictions among the people are not only manifested in the relationship between the Volunteer Army leaders and the masses, but also in the relationship between the Volunteer Army and the people of the motherland. In addition, some officers and soldiers of the Volunteer Army have certain great-power chauvinistic ideas. Therefore, this study is of particular importance and urgency to the Volunteer Army.

The meeting decided that in the study starting in May, democracy should be boldly promoted under leadership, and discussions should be fully launched, especially encouraging criticism from the bottom up, directing the spearhead at bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism. Leading cadres at all levels should go deep into the ranks to discover contradictions, analyze contradictions, and resolve contradictions, adopting the method of learning, examining, and improving simultaneously, in order to achieve the goal of solving problems and promoting work.

The meeting emphasized that the friendship and unity between the Volunteer Army and the Korean people is developing and strengthening day by day. In the future, the Volunteer Army officers and soldiers should also vigorously help the Korean people in their production and construction and further enhance the friendship and unity with the Korean people.

    志愿军党委讨论整风运动
    新华社平壤7日电　中共中国人民志愿军党委最近举行扩大会议，讨论如何学习毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾问题的讲话和开展整风运动。会议认为，由于志愿军驻在国外，人民内部矛盾不仅表现在志愿军领导和群众的关系上，而且也表现在志愿军和祖国人民的关系上，此外志愿军的部分官兵还存在着某些大国主义思想。因此，这一学习对志愿军说来，具有特殊的重要性和迫切性。
    会议决定，在5月份开始的学习中，要有领导地大胆发扬民主，充分展开讨论，特别要鼓励自下而上的批评，把锋芒指向官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义。各级领导干部要深入下去发现矛盾、分析矛盾和解决矛盾，采用边学习、边检查、边改进的办法，以达到解决问题、推进工作的目的。
    会议着重指出，志愿军同朝鲜人民之间的友谊团结是日益发展和巩固的，今后志愿军官兵还应大力帮助朝鲜人民的生产建设，进一步增强同朝鲜人民的友谊团结。
