Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, May 30th. Agricultural cooperatives in the disaster areas along the Huai River in Anhui Province are learning from the lessons of last year's wheat flooding and are actively preparing for early harvesting and rush harvesting of mid-season crops, determined to complete the harvest before the major flood season of the Huai River.

Last year, the flood season of the Huai River came early, and agricultural cooperatives in the low-lying areas along the river were not adequately prepared for wheat harvesting in advance, resulting in significant losses from wheat being flooded. This year, an exceptionally large amount of wheat has been planted in various areas along the Huai River, and it is growing particularly well. However, the agricultural cooperatives face difficulties in the summer harvest due to weak draft animals and a shortage of farm implements. At the same time, there is also the possibility of a major flood. In light of this situation, the Party committees at all levels in the areas along the Huai River began leading the agricultural cooperatives in making various preparations for early harvesting and rush harvesting as early as late April. The Dengta Agricultural Cooperative in Fengyang County plans to dedicate 95% of its labor force to the summer harvest, first concentrating its efforts on rush harvesting 4,000 mu of wheat in low-lying areas, and then harvesting the wheat in higher-lying areas. The Weidong Agricultural Cooperative, based on the maturity time of the wheat, is drawing over 300 laborers from teams with more late-maturing wheat and 170 laborers from the vegetable team, which has no summer harvesting tasks, to support teams with more early-maturing wheat in rush harvesting. The Yaoshan Cooperative in Huaiyuan County, facing a shortage of draft animals and farm implements, has organized over 200 laborers to transport the 1,400 mu of wheat closer to the village by carrying it on nets and shoulder poles.

In the flood discharge areas, flood storage areas, and severely waterlogged low-lying areas, the counties, districts, townships, and agricultural cooperatives have also prepared two sets of summer harvest plans, ready to proceed with rush harvesting according to the bad weather plan if the weather turns bad. In addition, rush harvesting and dredging headquarters (teams) have been established from top to bottom to lead this work. All agricultural cooperatives in the low-lying areas of Funan County have divided their labor force into several teams for flood prevention and levee protection, dredging and rush harvesting, and handling wet wheat. Each production team has prepared two kerosene lamps to facilitate overnight rush harvesting. The 25 production teams of the Lianhuai Cooperative in Angang District have each built six or more huts and prepared boats, door panels, and reed mats and other dredging tools.

### 接受去年小麦被淹的教训  安徽沿淮地区及早准备夏收

    接受去年小麦被淹的教训
    安徽沿淮地区及早准备夏收
    新华社合肥30日电　安徽省沿淮河灾区的农业社接受去年小麦被淹的教训，积极准备早收和抢收午季作物，并决心在淮河大汛之前收完。
    去年淮河汛期来得较早，沿淮洼地农业社事先收麦准备不够，许多麦子被淹，损失很大。而今年沿淮各地麦子又种得特别多，长得特别好，但是农业社的耕畜瘦弱、农具缺乏，给夏收工作带来困难。同时，还有发生特大洪水的可能。根据这种情况，沿淮地区的各级中共党委，早在4月下旬就领导农业社作了早收、抢收的各种准备工作。凤阳县灯塔农业社计划把95％的劳动力投入夏收，首先集中力量抢收四千亩低洼湾地的小麦，然后再收高地的麦子。卫东农业社根据麦子成熟期的早晚，从晚麦较多的队抽出三百多个劳动力，再从没有夏收任务的蔬菜队抽出一百七十个劳动力，支援早麦较多的队抢收。怀远县姚山社耕畜农具不够，就组织了二百多个劳动力，准备用网抬，担挑等办法，抢运靠村庄较近的一千四百亩小麦。
    在行洪区和蓄洪区以及内涝严重的洼地，各县、区、乡和农业社还作了两套夏收计划，准备天气变坏就按坏天气的计划进行抢收；并且从上到下成立了抢收打涝指挥部（队），领导这个工作。阜南县所有洼地的农业社，都把劳动力分成防汛护堤、打涝抢收、处理湿麦等几套班子。每个生产队都准备了两盏马灯，以便连夜抢收。安岗区联淮社二十五个生产队，每队都搭了六间以上的庵棚，准备下了船只、门板和箔席等打涝工具。
