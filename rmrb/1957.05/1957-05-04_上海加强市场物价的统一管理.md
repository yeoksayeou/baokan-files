Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 2nd. The Shanghai Municipal People's Committee convened a meeting on April 30th with the directors of various commercial bureaus, industrial bureaus, and heads of the handicraft and supply and marketing cooperative systems to study the strengthening of market price management. The meeting was presided over by Vice Mayors Cao Diqiu and Song Jiwen.

According to the situations presented by various departments at the meeting, since the second half of last year, Shanghai market prices, in addition to the central government's upward adjustment of prices for several commodities such as salt, pork, wool, and high-grade cigarettes, local commercial departments have also raised the prices of twenty commodities under their control, such as cured meat, toilet paper, and rice washing baskets. Commodities not controlled by commercial departments, such as self-sold products from joint ventures and handicraft cooperatives, and waste materials and local specialties on the free market, have seen even greater price increases.

The reasons for the price increases of the above commodities are very complex. Price increases in some industrial and handicraft products are due to rising raw material prices or quality difference adjustments. Most agricultural and sideline products and local specialties have seen increased selling prices due to rising prices at the place of origin. However, some commodity price increases are unreasonable. For example, some industrial departments slightly change the materials and specifications and then request to be treated as "new products" and raise prices. In the adjustment of quality differences, there is a tendency to choose the higher price rather than the lower one. In the free market, some commodities are also being sold at arbitrarily inflated prices. For example, the price of scrap iron was 130 yuan per ton in January last year, but the highest price rose to 700 yuan per ton in November last year.

Those present at the meeting unanimously agreed that in order to maintain price stability and people's livelihood, price adjustments must be strengthened and strictly controlled in the future, and every effort should be made to avoid adjustments if they are avoidable. In the future, if the cost of raw materials for industrial and handicraft products increases, efforts should be made to improve business management, and the industrial and commercial departments should jointly balance profits to avoid raising sales prices as much as possible. For agricultural and sideline products and local specialties whose prices have been raised at the place of origin, Shanghai commercial departments should strengthen contact with the place of origin and give priority to overcoming the difficulty of operating at a loss by reducing commodity circulation links and management costs, in order to stabilize sales prices. The retail prices of free markets and joint public-private stores should also be strengthened. For waste materials in the free market that have seen a large increase in prices, price negotiation methods can be implemented to ensure that industrial production obtains raw materials at stable prices.

Those present also unanimously believed that the unreasonable price increases of certain commodities in the previous period were related to the fact that various commodity prices were managed separately by various competent departments, lacking unified balancing. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a city-wide unified price management agency. The Municipal People's Committee has now decided that the Shanghai Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce will comprehensively manage the market prices of the entire Shanghai, uniformly balance and deploy price work, and adjudicate pricing issues between industry and commerce.

### 上海加强市场物价的统一管理

    上海加强市场物价的统一管理
    新华社上海2日电　上海市人民委员会在4月30日召集各商业局、各工业局的局长和手工业、供销合作社系统的负责人，开会研究加强市场物价的管理工作。会议由副市长曹荻秋、宋季文主持。
    根据各部门在会上提出的情况，上海市场物价从去年下半年以来，除中央规定的食盐、猪肉、呢绒、高级卷烟等几种商品价格上调外，地方商业部门掌握价格的商品也有咸肉、卫生纸、淘米箩等二十种商品提高了价格。不属于商业部门掌握的商品，如合营工厂和手工业合作社的自销产品和自由市场上的废旧料、小土特产等，价格上涨得更多些。
    以上商品的涨价，原因十分复杂。部分工业品和手工业品提价是由于原料价格上涨或品质差价调整。农副产品和土特产品，大多是因为产地价格上升而调高了售价。但也有部分商品价格上涨是不合理的。例如有些工业部门稍稍改变一下用料和规格，就要求作“新产品”而提高价格，在品质差价的调整中，有就高不就低的现象。在自由市场上，也有某些商品随意抬价出售的情况。如废旧铁去年1月每吨一百三十元，去年11月每吨价格最高涨到七百元。
    到会的人一致同意，为了保持物价稳定和人民生活安定，今后物价的调整必须加强管理、严格控制，凡可调可不调的应力求不调。今后工业品和手工业品原料等成本增加，应力求改善经营管理，由工业部门、商业部门共同平衡利润，尽量避免调高销售价格。凡是产地调高价格的农副产品和土特产品，上海商业部门应该同产地加强联系，尽先从减少商品流转环节和经营管理费用来克服经营赔本的困难，以稳定销售价格。对自由市场和公私合营商店的零售价格也要加强管理。自由市场上价格上涨幅度较大的废旧原料，可实行议价的办法，以保证工业生产获得价格稳定的原料。
    到会者还一致认为，前一时期某些商品价格上升有不合理的情况，同目前各种商品价格由各主管部门分散管理，缺乏统一的平衡有关，因此有必要成立一个全市统一的物价专管机构。市人民委员会现在已经决定，由上海市工商行政管理局综合管理全上海的市场物价，统一平衡和部署物价工作，裁决工商之间的作价问题。
