How Many Babies Are Born Every Minute?

    On average, 170 babies are born every minute worldwide, and 90 people pass away.

    This is according to statistics from the United Nations Statistical Office. It has compiled a "Demographic Yearbook" of more than 700 pages based on population surveys from more than 200 countries.

    It is estimated that if the population continues to grow at a rate of nearly 120,000 people per day, the current population of 2.7 billion will more than double by the end of this century.

    每分钟有多少婴孩出世？
    全世界平均每分钟有一百七十个婴孩出世，九十个人离开人间。
    这是联合国统计局统计出来的。它根据二百多个国家人口调查编纂了一本有七百多页的“人口年鉴”。
    据估计，如果按照每天增加近十二万人口的速率增长的话，到本世纪末，现有二十七亿人口将增加一倍之多。
