    Xinhua News Agency report: Nepal's "People's Daily" reported on May 22: In the Nepalese village of Chirongka, a skull said to be that of the "Abominable Snowman" (i.e., "Yeti") has been preserved for twenty-five years.
    The news said that twenty-five years ago, thirty-two Nepalese soldiers went to the border between Tibet and Nepal. One night on their march, they were attacked by this monster. Only one person survived and escaped to report to the authorities. When a large number of soldiers arrived, they found the "Snowman" asleep among the bodies of the killed soldiers, some of whom had already been eaten. The soldiers opened fire on it, and ten bullets hit it, but it did not die. The soldiers fired a second time and killed it.

    关于“雪人”的传说
    据新华社讯　尼泊尔“平民日报”5月22日报道：在尼泊尔契隆卡村落里，二十五年来一直保存着一个据说是“可恨的雪人”（即“耶提”）的头颅。
    消息说，二十五年前，有三十二个尼泊尔兵士到西藏和尼泊尔边界去。在行军中途的一天夜里，他们遭到了这个怪物的攻击，当时只有一人幸免，逃出去报告当局。当大批士兵赶到的时候，发现“雪人”正熟睡在被杀死的士兵尸体中间，有几个尸体已经被它吃掉了。士兵们向它开枪，有十发子弹击中了它，但是它并没有死。士兵们进行了第二次射击才把它杀死。
