Does the Bourgeoisie Have Negative Aspects?
Should Public Representatives be Removed?
A Debate Unfolds at a Symposium for Industrialists and Businessmen

(Reported by Our Newspaper) The joint symposium for industrialists and businessmen, co-sponsored by the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Eighth Office of the State Council, held its fourth session yesterday (May 18th). Six people spoke at the meeting.

The first speaker was Li Guowei, a standing committee member of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce. After providing two suggestions on planned production, he expressed his personal views on the balance between industrial production plans and handicraft production plans. He said: China has a large population, and developing handicraft production is essential; developing handicraft production can not only solve the employment problem for some people but also allow the country to fully utilize modern equipment to develop heavy industry.

Ma Chunlin Disagrees with Bi Mingqi's Opinion
The Bourgeoisie is Powerless Without the Leadership of the Party

The next speaker was Ma Chunlin, Deputy Secretary-General of the Shenyang Federation of Industry and Commerce, who was speaking for the second time at the symposium. He disagreed with Bi Mingqi's assessment of the Chinese national bourgeoisie. He said: Bi Mingqi believes that those engaged in illegal activities are those self-sufficient households who are not highly conscious and whose government management is not strict, not the true national bourgeoisie, and that the national bourgeoisie is being "punished for others' mistakes," which is somewhat unfair. I think this is "the pot calling the kettle black," overemphasizing the positive side of capitalists handing over their enterprises, forgetting the essential bourgeois ideology, and forgetting that large households also developed from small to large, from nothing to something. I believe that because the national bourgeoisie has a positive side, it can accept reform; and because the national bourgeoisie has a negative side, it must be reformed. This is a question of accepting reform and needing reform. The Chinese national bourgeoisie can have today, can have the ability to be a public official, and can gloriously participate in the government, thanks to the leadership of the Communist Party. We can hardly imagine what our national bourgeoisie would become if the Communist Party did not hold power. Perhaps the vast majority of us would end up like Manager Pan in "Sunrise." I think this is a matter of the laws of development, and I don't admit it's a sense of inferiority. After the public-private partnership with much fanfare, what I felt was not tears, but that wages could be paid, production was normal, labor-capital relations were improved, work was smooth, those who rode in sedan chairs still rode in sedan chairs, and even if they lost money, they could still get fixed interest. I felt that my ability was insufficient and had no grievances to express.

Although the Chinese national bourgeoisie is a relatively cultured and technically skilled class in the current stage, and is China's wealth; this is in terms of the entire class, not each of us individually. Each of us, limited by our class essence, is always up and down like a bucket in a well, worrying about gains and losses. In terms of management ability, we are moving from blind management to planned production, from direct management to regional management, from patriarchal dictatorship to democratic centralism; from a fatalistic management of great victories and great defeats to an economic accounting system. This set of planned production, regional management, economic accounting system, democratic centralism, as well as what are called assembly line operations, technical and financial measures plans, etc., are all new to us. I studied in capitalist countries and specialized in factory management. In the two years since the public-private partnership, I feel that following for one year is better than reading for ten years. I believe that our national bourgeoisie is powerless without the leadership of the Party!

Now, when we hear the positive side, we always feel comfortable, and even become arrogant; but when we hear the negative side, we always feel it is harsh, and even want to "rival each other" and "replace them." To tell you the truth, the public representatives have also suffered enough, on the one hand, they have to complete the national plan, and on the other hand, they have to unite us to do a good job in reform. The formula of achieving new unity through criticism and self-criticism based on the desire for unity is not simple to implement. The situations vary, and the degree of acceptance also varies. I think "being strict with oneself and lenient with others" requires us to conduct some self-criticism.

He said: I 100% agree with holding such a meeting, where everyone can express their opinions and argue, and distinguish between right and wrong, so that the bitterness and estrangement between the two sides can be resolved.

Finally, he said that public representatives cannot be removed, and the leadership of the Party is even more indispensable because we are powerless without the leadership of the Party.

Xu Hansan Criticizes Certain Party Members
For Not Seeing the Centripetal Force of Non-Party Members

Xu Hansan of the China Democratic National Construction Association first criticized the shortcomings in the work of the United Front Work Department. He said that in recent years, some key members have been cultivated in the democratic parties, and most of these key members are good, but many have gradually become detached from the masses, and some cannot truly represent the interests of the masses. This account should be attributed to the United Front Work Department. He believes that many Communist Party members who participate in democratic parties have poor cultivation, a sense of superiority, and cannot be criticized. Some even say that criticizing Party members is an act of opposing the Party, and opposing the Party is counter-revolutionary. Criticism is also rarely carried out among Communist Party members. The United Front Work Department has not checked and dealt with these bad situations in a timely manner, which also shows sectarianism. He believes that there is a wall between the Party and non-Party members, and it is not very equal. He cited an example, saying that on a certain matter, Luo Longji once expressed his attitude, saying that even if Premier Zhou agreed, I would not agree; later, he was criticized for being too arrogant. The Party has prestige and attraction, and non-Party members have centripetal force, but unfortunately, some Party members cannot see the centripetal force of non-Party members. When talking about the question of whether the bourgeoisie has two sides, he said that it is certain that it has two sides; however, when Xu Dixin analyzed the negative side of the bourgeoisie, he ignored the need to make specific analyses of specific situations. The ideology that has been formed by the industrial and commercial sectors for a long time cannot be solved with a quick solution; if the analysis is not specific, it will not be persuasive and will not solve other people's problems. Finally, he said that in the future, in addition to organizing them to conduct theoretical studies, the education of industrialists and businessmen should also organize them to do some practical life investigation work, so that more contact with practice will be beneficial to improving understanding.

Song Lianfu said:
Negativity Exists Not Only in the Bourgeoisie, But Also in the Working Class

Song Lianfu, Deputy Secretary-General of the Hubei Federation of Industry and Commerce, cited five examples of small vendors committing suicide due to financial difficulties and suggested that the government actively arrange the lives of small vendors. The working hours of some small and medium-sized enterprise employees in Hubei Province are too long, and he suggested that the government stipulate a rotational rest system.

Regarding the two-sidedness of industrialists and businessmen, he believes that as a class, negativity is not unique to industrialists and businessmen, but also exists in the working class. Because most of the industrialists and businessmen in China are of working people's origin, they are also trying to make a living in the society where the big fish eats the small fish. Therefore, the two-sidedness is not unique to industrialists and businessmen, but should be something that everyone has. He said that some people say that the United Front Work Department unites those above but not those below, and unites the big but not the small, which is reasonable. Those who are arranged better are all upper-level figures. In our area, some counties arrange some industrialists and businessmen to engage in cultural, educational, and health work. Is it because financial and economic work is important and they are unwilling to assign it to industrialists and businessmen? This is also a manifestation of sectarianism. Finally, he suggested that the nature of the Federation of Industry and Commerce should be widely publicized, and the heads of relevant departments of the Central Committee should often go down to the grassroots level. It is best to organize inspection groups to go to provinces, towns, and remote areas to take a look and learn more. He also suggested setting up more United Front Work Departments in some counties and equipping them with more United Front cadres.

Jing Shuping Disagrees with Withdrawing Public Representatives

Jing Shuping, Deputy Secretary-General of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, said: Some people have suggested that in order to give full play to the enthusiasm of private personnel, only work relations and not class relations should be mentioned in joint ventures. Others have suggested that the responsibilities of private personnel should be increased in joint ventures and that public representatives should not be needed. I disagree with this view. Class relations are objectively existent. At present, a considerable portion of private personnel in joint ventures still receive fixed interest and high salaries. Without class relations, we would not be able to obtain these. The current issue is not whether to acknowledge the existence of class relations, but how to handle them. Now that there are public representatives, they bear more responsibilities, and private personnel feel that they have the position but not the power. However, it is worth considering whether private personnel can truly take on all the work if public representatives actually withdraw. Everyone knows that when public representatives come, workers welcome them with gongs and drums, and workers feel that they have become masters, and production has changed. Without public representatives going to the factory, private personnel cannot play this role. Moreover, the public representatives represent the state and consider the interests of all parties when handling problems, which also eases the relationship between private personnel and all parties. This is also something that private personnel cannot replace. In addition, democratic management of socialist enterprises, following the mass line, etc., are all unfamiliar to us, and public representatives are stronger than us, and we have learned a lot from them. All of the above shows that the role of the public representative system cannot be denied. As for some public representatives who have not played such a role and have a poor relationship with private personnel, that is because they have not fulfilled their responsibilities and have problems with their personal ideology and work style, which should be criticized. If they do not accept it, the government can be requested to replace them, but the system of public representatives cannot be abolished. However, it can also be piloted in a small number of enterprises with good conditions, such as sound trade union organizations, Party organizations, democratic management committees, politically progressive and professionally proficient private personnel, to gain experience.

He said that the Communist Party is a very good Party, but it has also done many stupid things, that is, the practice of taking everything over. For example, after the Hunan representative reflected the high tide, a small number of small vendors committed suicide due to financial difficulties. The financial difficulties of small vendors did not start today, so why did they not commit suicide earlier, but only after the high tide? This is because of the shortcomings in our work, failing to take them all over (in fact, our country is so poor that it is impossible to take them all over), and not giving them a way out for free operation, which made them feel unable to live. He said that to solve the problem of the financial difficulties of small vendors, it is not enough to rely solely on asking the government for money, but it is necessary to give full play to social forces and give them an appropriate way out for free operation. Don't call spontaneous factories "underground factories"; calling them "underground factories" means that they are illegal, but what they do is needed by the people, so why not let them do it? The government should manage, but not too strictly. Don't be afraid of them taking the capitalist road. As long as various measures are taken, they can be guided onto the correct path. He also raised some opinions on the issue of the welfare benefits of industrialists and businessmen.

Finally, he said that some people criticize the United Front Work Department for uniting those above but not those below. I don't think it's a matter of the size of the United Front, because Minister Li Weihan cannot shake hands with all industrialists and businessmen one by one. But it is a question of how to implement the United Front policy. It is wrong for some public representatives not to attend meetings. The local CPPCC meetings are of a United Front nature, but they have not played a good role either. These all affect the implementation of the United Front policy. Regarding the system of people's congresses, he suggested that some specialized committees be established outside the Standing Committee to solve various specialized problems. Representatives to the People's Congresses should bear more responsibilities as people's representatives, and hold fewer other positions, and not just speak and raise their hands to pass resolutions at meetings, and then go out for inspections once a year.

Su Xianqin said:
Private Personnel Have Negative Factors
Withdrawing Public Representatives is Not Conducive to Production

Su Xianqin, Secretary-General of the Wuhan Federation of Industry and Commerce, first expressed his gratitude to the Party in his speech. He said that under the education of the Party, his several enterprises have successively entered into joint ventures in recent years, and he is now also serving as the manager of a professional company, and he feels honored and excited. Then, he expressed his personal views on the issues of whether there are class relations in public-private relations and whether public representatives should be withdrawn from joint ventures. He said that many people have mentioned such issues recently, and many people have put forward different views; my view is that our private personnel have not yet undergone a thorough transformation. If private enterprises are said to be the maiden's family, and joint ventures are the in-law's family, then the relationship with the maiden's family is gradually becoming distant, and the relationship with the in-law's family is becoming closer. But this does not mean that there is no distance between the public and private parties. At present, class relations exist, and this class relation is not artificial, but objectively existent. Private personnel must understand their own class limitations at all times and in all places in order to better approach the public. Denying class relations is ignoring objective existence, which is like a blind man riding a blind horse, which is dangerous. In estimating the public-private cooperation relationship in Wuhan, he said: In several large factories in Wuhan, private personnel have positions and powers. Of course, there are also problems; the existence of some problems is determined by whether private personnel dare to take bold responsibility, whether they have a deep understanding of policies, whether their work is in-depth, and whether they understand the management methods of socialist enterprises. Without these, even if you have the power, it will not work. He also said that after the joint venture, the positive factors of private personnel have increased, but the negative factors still exist. There are contradictions between the public and private parties, which is also inevitable. Denying the existence of contradictions is not realistic and is not conducive to solving problems. Finally, he declared that he disagreed with withdrawing public representatives from joint ventures. He said that private personnel are limited by class nature and have insufficient experience, and withdrawing public representatives is not conducive to production. There is much work that private personnel cannot replace.

The symposium will have a day off on the 19th (Sunday) and will continue on the 20th.

### 资产阶级有没有消极性？  公方代表要不要撤除？  工商界座谈会上展开争论

专栏：

    资产阶级有没有消极性？
    公方代表要不要撤除？
    工商界座谈会上展开争论
    本报讯　中共中央统战部和国务院第八办公室联合召开的工商界座谈会，于昨日（18日）举行了第四次座谈。会上有六个人发了言。
    第一个发言的是全国工商联常务委员李国伟。他对计划生产提供了两点建议后，又对工业生产计划和手工业生产计划的平衡问题发表了个人的看法。他说：我国人口众多，发展手工业生产是十分必要的；发展手工业生产，不仅可以解决部分人的劳动就业问题，而且也可以使国家充分利用现代化的设备，来发展重工业。
    马春霖不同意毕鸣岐的意见
    资产阶级离开党的领导是无能为力的
    接着发言的是沈阳市工商联副秘书长马春霖，这是他参加座谈会的第二次发言。他不同意毕鸣岐对中国民族资产阶级估价的提法。他说：毕鸣岐认为当前有不法行为的，是那些觉悟不高、政府管理不严的自负盈亏户，不是真正民族资产阶级，民族资产阶级“代人受过”未免有些委屈。我认为这是 “五十步笑百步”，过分强调资本家交出企业的积极一面，忘掉了资产阶级思想本质，忘掉了大户也是从小到大从无到有发展起来的。我认为因为民族资产阶级有积极一面，所以才能接受改造；又因为民族资产阶级有消极一面，所以就必须改造。这是一个接受改造和必须改造的问题。中国民族资产阶级能有今天，能有本事作为一个公职人员，能光荣的参加政权，要感谢的是共产党的领导。我们很难想像，如果不是共产党掌握政权，我们民族资产阶级会变成什么样子。也许我们之中绝大多数会走到“日出”里潘经理的下场。我认为这是发展规律问题，我不承认是自卑感。敲锣打鼓公私合营以后，我感到的不是掉泪，而是工资开得出去了，生产正常了，劳资关系改善了，工作顺利了，坐轿子的还坐轿子，甚至赔了钱还可以拿定息，我倒是觉着能力不够，毫无苦水可吐。
    虽然中国民族资产阶级，在现阶段是个比较有文化有技术的阶级，是中国的财富；但这是就整个阶级来说的，不是说我们每一个人。我们每个人，限于阶级本质，吊桶老是七上八下，患得患失。就经营能力来说，我们是由盲目经营走向计划生产，是由直线管理走向区域管理，是由家长式独裁走向民主集中；是由大胜大败宿命式的经营走向经济核算制。这一套计划生产、区域管理、经济核算制、民主集中制，以及什么流水作业、技术财务措施计划等等，对我们都是新的。我在资本主义国家留过学，还专攻过工厂管理这一门课程。公私合营二年来，我感到真是追随一年，胜读十年书。我认为我们民族资产阶级离开党的领导是无能为力的！
    现在我们听到积极一面，总觉着舒服，甚至就自高自大起来；而听到消极一面，老觉着刺耳，甚至要“分庭抗礼”“取而代之”。说句良心话，公方也够苦的，一方面要完成国家计划，一方面要团结我们做好改造工作。从团结愿望出发经过批评和自我批评达到新的团结，这个公式执行起来并不简单，有的情况不同，有的接受的程度也有所不同。我认为“躬自厚而薄责于人，我们有必要进行一下自我批评”。
    他说：我百分之百赞成开这样一个会，大家有鸣有争，是就是是，非就是非，双方苦闷隔阂是可以解除的。
    最后他说，公方代表是撤不得的，党的领导更是不可缺的。因为我们离开党的领导是无能为力的。
    许汉三批评某些党员
    看不到党外人士的向心力
    民主建国会许汉三首先批评了统战部工作中的缺点。他说，几年来，民主党派中是培养了一些骨干分子，这些骨干分子多数人是好的，但也有不少的人逐渐地脱离了群众，还有些人不能真正代表群众的利益。这个账应该算在统战部的身上。他认为：不少参加民主党派的共产党员，修养差，有优越感，批评不得，竟有人说，批评了党员就是反党的行为，反党就是反革命，在共产党员之间，也很少开展批评。这些不好的情况，统战部检查处理得不及时，也说明了有宗派主义。他认为：党与非党之间，有墙，而且也不大平等。他举例说：在某一件事情上，罗隆基曾表示态度说这件事即使周总理答应，我也不肯答应；后来竟有人批评他太骄傲了。党有威信，有吸引力，党外人士有向心力，可惜一些党员对党外人士的向心力却看不到。他在谈到资产阶级有没有两面性的问题时说，有两面性是肯定的；不过，许涤新在分析资产阶级消极一面的时候，忽略了对具体情况作具体的分析，工商界长期间形成的思想，企图用速成的办法来解决，这是行不通的；如果分析不具体，说服力不大，解决不了别人的问题。最后他说：今后对工商业者的教育，除了组织他们进行理论学习外，还应该多组织他们做一些实际生活的考察工作，多接触实际，对提高认识是有好处的。
    宋莲甫说：
    消极性不仅资产阶级有，工人阶级也有
    湖北工商联副秘书长宋莲甫举了五个小商小贩因生活困难而自杀的例子，建议政府要积极安排小商小贩的生活。湖北省一些中小企业职工工作时间过长，他建议政府规定轮流休息制度。
    关于工商业者的两面性问题，他认为：作为阶级的消极性，不是工商业者独有的，工人阶级也有。因为中国工商业者大多数是劳动人民出身，他们在大鱼吃小鱼的社会里也是为了生活。因此，两面性不是工商业者独有的，要有大家都有。他说：有人说统战部统上不统下，统大不统小，是有道理的。被安排较好的都是上层人物。我们那里有的县把有的工商业者安排去搞文教卫生，是不是因为财经工作重要，不愿分给工商业者呢？这也是宗派主义的表现。最后，他建议对于工商联的性质要扩大宣传，中央有关部门的首长要经常下去，最好组织视察组，到省、镇以及偏僻的地方去看一看，多了解了解。他还建议多在一些县设立统战部，多配备一些统战干部。
    经叔平不同意撤出公方代表
    全国工商联副秘书长经叔平说：有人提出，为了发挥私方人员的积极性，是否在合营企业中只提工作关系，不提阶级关系。还有人提出，是否在合营企业中加重私方人员的责任，不要公方代表。我不同意这种提法。阶级关系是客观存在，目前合营企业中还有相当一部分私方人员拿定息，拿高薪，没有阶级关系，我们就得不到这些。当前不是承认阶级关系存在不存在的问题，而是如何处理的问题。现在有公方代表，他们多负了一些责任，私方就感到有职无权。可是，公方代表当真退出去，私方人员是否就能把全部工作担负起来，是值得考虑的。大家都知道，公方来了，工人敲锣打鼓欢迎，工人感到自己当了主人，生产起了变化。没有公方代表下厂，私方人员是起不了这种作用的。而且公方代表国家，处理问题考虑几方面的利益，使私方人员和各方面的关系也缓和了。这也是私方人员不能代替的。另外，社会主义企业的民主管理，走群众路线等等，对我们这些人来说，都是陌生的，公方代表要比我们强，我们向他们学到了不少东西。以上这些，都说明公方代表制度的作用是不能抹杀的。至于部分公方代表没有起到这样的作用，和私方人员关系搞得不好，那是由于他们没有尽到自己的责任，个人思想作风上的问题，应该提出批评，如不接受，可以要求政府撤换他，但不能取消公方代表的制度。不过，也可以在少数有条件的企业，如工会组织、党组织、民主管理委员会较健全、私方人员政治上较进步、业务较熟练的企业里试点，摸摸经验。
    他说，共产党是个很好的党，但是也做了很多蠢事，那就是全部包下来的做法。比如湖南代表反映高潮后，有少数小商小贩因生活所迫自杀了。小商小贩生活困难不是在今天，他们所以早不自杀，高潮以后才自杀，是由于我们工作中的缺点，没能把他们全部包下来（事实上，我们国家这么穷，也不可能把他们全部包下来），又没有给他们自由经营的出路，因此才使他们感到无法生活下去。他说，要解决小商小贩生活困难的问题，不是光依靠伸手向政府要钱，而是要发挥社会力量，要给他们适当自由经营的出路，不要把自发工厂叫“地下工厂”；叫“地下工厂”就意味着不合法，而他们做的事是人民需要的，为什么不让他们做呢？政府要管，但不要管得太死。不要怕他们走资本主义道路。只要采取各种办法，是可以引导他们走正确道路的。关于工商业者的福利待遇问题，他也提出了一些意见。
    最后，他说，有人批评统战部统上不统下。我认为不是统战面大小的问题，因为李维汉部长不能和所有的工商业者都一一握手。而是统战政策如何贯彻的问题。有些公方代表开会不参加是不对的。各地政协会议是统战性质的，但也没有很好发挥作用。这些都影响统战政策的贯彻。关于人民代表大会制度问题，他建议在常委外再成立一些专门性质的委员会，解决各类专门问题。人民代表大会代表应多负一些人民代表的责任，少兼一些其他职务，不要只是开会发言，举手通过，每年出去视察一次就完了。
    苏先勤说：
    私方人员存在消极因素
    撤出公方代表对生产不利
    武汉市工商联秘书长苏先勤在发言中首先对党表示感谢，他说：在党的教育下，几年来，我的几个企业先后合营了，现在我还担任一个专业公司的经理，感到光荣兴奋。接着他对公私关系中有无阶级关系以及公方代表要不要撤出合营企业的问题，发表了个人的见解。他说：近来有不少人提到过这样的问题，有很多人提出了不同的看法；我的看法是我们私方人员还没有经过脱胎换骨的改造。如果把私营企业说成是娘家，合营企业是婆家的话，现在娘家的关系是渐远了，和婆家的关系是亲近了。但这并不是说公私双方就没有距离。目前阶级关系是存在的，这种阶级关系不是人为的，而是客观存在。私方人员，要随时随地了解自己的阶级局限性，这样才能更好地接近公方。否认阶级关系，就是无视客观存在，这是盲人骑瞎马，是危险的。他在估计武汉市的公私共事关系时说：武汉市的几个大厂子，私方人员是有职有权的。当然也不是没有问题；有些问题的存在，是由于私方人员是否敢大胆负责，对政策领会是否深刻，工作是否深入，对社会主义企业管理方法是否了解等条件决定的。不这样，即使有权也不行。他又说：私方人员在合营以后，积极因素增加了，但消极因素还是存在的。公私双方有矛盾，这也是必然的，否认矛盾的存在，不现实，对解决问题不利。最后他申明，不同意从合营企业中撤出公方代表。他说：私方人员受阶级性的限制，经验也不足，撤出公方代表，对生产是不利的。有许多工作，私方人员是不可能代替的。
    座谈会在19日（星期日）休息一天，20日继续举行。
