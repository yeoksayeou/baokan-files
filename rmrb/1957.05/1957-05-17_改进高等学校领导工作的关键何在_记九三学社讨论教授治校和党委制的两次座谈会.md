Where Lies the Key to Improving Leadership in Higher Education?
--A Record of Two Symposiums Held by the Jiusan Society to Discuss Professor-led Governance and the Party Committee System

Recently, with the exposure of various contradictions in institutions of higher learning, how to improve the leadership in these institutions has become a matter of concern for all parties. In order to gain a clearer understanding of this issue, the Standing Committee of the Jiusan Society Central Committee invited some of its members working in institutions of higher learning and scientific research to hold two symposiums on May 10th and 15th. Many scholars and experts attending the meeting expressed many active and beneficial opinions, focusing on the question of whether it is better to implement a Party committee system or professor-led governance in institutions of higher learning.

Different Views on Professor-led Governance

According to Comrade Huang Ziqing, professor of the Chemistry Department of Peking University, and Comrade Lou Bangyan, Deputy Director of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Justice, Tsinghua University and Peking University both practiced professor-led governance before liberation. At that time, Tsinghua University was composed of a professors' association consisting of associate professors and above, which then elected nine people to form a council. All major issues related to the university's work, such as the hiring or firing of professors, the selection of students to study abroad, the addition or reduction of departments, and the allocation of funds, were discussed and decided by the council; only issues that it could not resolve were submitted to the professors' association for discussion and decision. Professor Huang Ziqing believes that this approach has many benefits, the most important of which is the ability to fairly evaluate professors' academic achievements, ensure professors have stable employment, and reduce personnel infighting and rivalry. Therefore, he suggested that while continuing to maintain the Party committee system, a professor-led governance approach should be adopted in institutions of higher learning. In the future, all major issues related to teaching and academics should be managed by the professors' association, while the Party committee should mainly be responsible for political and ideological work.

Pan Shu, former President of Nanjing University and Director of the Institute of Psychology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, basically agreed with Professor Huang Ziqing's views. He believes that professors should be informed of and consulted on major issues related to teaching and academics. However, in the past, professors were unaware of and unable to know about many things. If professor-led governance can be implemented in the future, this situation can be changed, which will help overcome bureaucracy in the university's leadership work, further promote democracy in institutions of higher learning, and supervise the work of the Party committee.

Lou Bangyan, Deputy Director, and Meng Zhaoying, Director of the Radio Department of Tsinghua University, and others believe that an analytical and critical attitude should be adopted towards professor-led governance, and the past practices should not be mechanically copied. Lou Bangyan believes that professor-led governance at Tsinghua was essentially rule by elders and oligarchy; the so-called stability only stabilized this part of the people. He said: It is entirely certain that sectarianism existed at Tsinghua under professor-led governance. With very few exceptions, it was very difficult for someone who was not a student who had studied in the United States to enter Tsinghua. In 1939, when he returned from studying abroad, his teacher Zhang Xiruo was the director of the political science department at Tsinghua and wanted him to teach at Tsinghua; while his other teacher Qian Duansheng was the director of the political science department at Peking University and wanted him to teach at Peking University. Although Peking University gave him a monthly salary of 320 yuan at the time, while Tsinghua only offered 280 yuan, he still chose Tsinghua instead of Peking University because he was influenced by the "Tsinghua spirit." He believes that this kind of sectarianism should never be revived in today's institutions of higher learning. At the same time, he does not advocate copying Peking University's professor-led governance, because at that time (referring to after 1946), professor-led governance at Peking University was mainly to fight against Hu Shi and to carry out a democratic movement among professors; while in today's institutions of higher learning, the Communist Party is not the target of everyone's struggle. Therefore, he believes that although professor-led governance has its good points, its shortcomings should not be denied; whether to propose professor-led governance today and what its content should be requires careful consideration.

Several professors expressed their agreement with Lou Bangyan's above opinions in their speeches. Meng Zhaoying said: Professor-led governance at Tsinghua was almost like the U.S. Congress, very democratic in form, but actually controlled by a few people. Zhou Binglin, a professor at Peking University (member of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, specially invited to the meeting), reflected that young people have a great aversion to professor-led governance, believing it to be a rule by feudal bosses. Jin Xiwu, a professor in the Mechanical Manufacturing Department of Tsinghua University, in addition to agreeing that the professor-led governance of the past was bourgeois democracy, also believes that it was the inevitable product of academic education divorced from reality.

Is it a Problem of the System or of Ideological Style?

In analyzing and criticizing the shortcomings in the leadership of institutions of higher learning, it can almost be said that the opinions at the symposium were consistent. That is, the reason why there are many shortcomings in the current leadership work of institutions of higher learning is not mainly because the Party committee system is bad, but because there are many problems with the ideological style of Party members, and their concentrated manifestations are bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism.

Many professors analyzed the situation of Party members at the meeting. They believe that Party members working in institutions of higher learning are generally of good quality and work actively and diligently; however, there are also many relatively serious shortcomings. These are mainly: First, they are generally still relatively young and lack rich social work experience and school management experience, so their methods of dealing with people and things are relatively simple, their consideration of issues is not thorough and comprehensive enough, and it is inevitable that shortcomings and mistakes occur. Second, precisely because they are generally still relatively young, their academic achievements are relatively shallow, and some are even completely ignorant of teaching and academics. In this way, they cannot combine the Party's policies and guidelines well with teaching and academic work, and they cannot come up with better ideas and methods in this regard. Third, it can almost be said that in the past few years, a completely negative attitude has been adopted towards veteran teachers, believing that what they have learned is capitalist and outdated. In fact, veteran teachers have academic achievements, and many have rich experience in running schools.

Many professors believe that in the past few years, the phenomenon of emphasizing politics over professional work has been very serious in institutions of higher learning; it is of course right to emphasize politics, but it is wrong to neglect professional work. Because institutions of higher learning are teaching and academic research institutions, neglecting professional work will make it impossible to cultivate qualified talents and improve China's academic level. Moreover, the so-called emphasis on politics is also considered to mean that only Party members, Youth League members, and young talents are reliable, and veteran teachers seem to be ideologically backward and historically complicated people who cannot be trusted politically. Over time, not only has a high wall been built between Party members and senior intellectuals, but also the prestige of veteran teachers in the school has been reduced. This cannot but affect the enthusiasm of veteran teachers.

Several professors mentioned that in the past, the school Party committee managed too many things, and there was a phenomenon of separation of Party and government. They believe that it is inappropriate to move the enterprise Party committee system to institutions of higher learning, where the Party committee leads and supervises the school's work. On issues related to teaching and academics, more opinions from veteran teachers should be heard.

How to Improve Leadership Work

Since the occurrence of many shortcomings in institutions of higher learning today is not mainly because the Party committee system is bad, but because there are problems with the ideological style of Party organizations and Party members, and among them, the lack of democratic style is the main problem, most people do not advocate professor-led governance. There are mainly the following reasons: First, Wei Jiangong, a professor in the Chinese Department of Peking University, and others believe that the situation in institutions of higher learning today is very different from the past, and political and ideological education work occupies a very important position. It is impossible to run the school well by relying solely on professor-led governance. Second, Zhou Peiyuan, Vice President of Peking University, believes that the task of institutions of higher learning today is to train talents for the country, and they must obey the needs of the country. Therefore, although the opinions of professors should be sought on issues related to the school's work guidelines and tasks, the final decision must be made by the state. Returning to the professor-led governance of the past would be very difficult. Third, Zhou Binglin, a professor at Peking University, and others believe that professors occupy a very important position in teaching and academic research in institutions of higher learning; but from the perspective of the quantity of teaching work, young lecturers and teaching assistants account for a larger proportion. Therefore, from the perspective of doing a good job in current teaching work or training cadres, their opinions should not be ignored. Fourth, in today's situation, six-fifths of the problems are not guaranteed, and if professor-led governance is implemented again, there will be even less guarantee; moreover, many veteran teachers only like to teach and do not like to get involved in administrative work.

Based on the above reasons, most people believe that it is better to propose democratic school management, and there are two opinions on the specific practices. One opinion is to expand the current school affairs committee, with the main members being professors and associate professors, while also absorbing lecturers, teaching assistants, and staff to participate. All major issues related to school affairs should be discussed and decided by it, and then suggestions should be made to the school's administrative authorities for adoption and implementation. Another opinion basically agrees with the above approach, but advocates that the school affairs committee should become the highest decision-making body, and the decisions it passes must be implemented by the president. On the appointment of school affairs committee members, some believe that since the school is not a state power organ, only people with prestige and mass base should be appointed by the president. Others believe that not only school affairs committee members, but also department heads and teaching and research section chiefs can be produced by election.

Li Changzhi, a professor in the Chinese Department of Beijing Normal University, believes that a professors' association can also be established at the same time. Because expanding the school affairs committee is certainly one of the ways to promote democracy; however, since only a few professors participate in the school affairs committee, the opinions of professors will not be fully reflected. Moreover, since the school can have a student union, it can of course also have a professors' association. With a professors' association, not only can professors' opinions on running the school be fully reflected, but also the status of professors will be improved, and the problem of professors being respected will also be solved. He said: The purpose of his suggestion is not to replace the Party committee system with professor-led governance, but to help the Party committee better implement policies, promote democracy, and overcome bureaucracy.

    改进高等学校领导工作的关键何在
    ——记九三学社讨论教授治校和党委制的两次座谈会
    近来，随着高等学校中各类矛盾的被揭露，怎样改进高等学校的领导工作，已经成为各方面关心的问题。为了求得对这个问题有一个比较明确的认识，九三学社中央常务委员会邀请在高等学校和科学研究等机关工作的部分社员，在5月10日和15日举行了两次座谈会。到会的许多学者专家，围绕着是在高等学校中实行党委制好，还是实行教授治校好这个问题，发表了许多积极的有益的意见。
    对教授治校的不同看法
    据北京大学化学系教授黄子卿和北京市司法局副局长楼邦彦等同志谈，解放以前的清华大学和北京大学都实行教授治校。当时的清华大学，是由副教授以上的人组成教授会，再由教授会推选九人组成评议会。凡是有关学校工作中的重大问题，例如聘请或辞退教授、选派出国留学生、增添或减少系科以及经费的支配等，都由评议会讨论并作出决定；只有它不能解决的问题，才提交教授会讨论和决定。黄子卿教授认为，这种作法有许多好处，其中最重要的是能够对教授在学术上的成就有个公平的估价，保证教授有一个安定的工作，减少人事上的互相倾轧和排挤。因此，他建议在继续保持党委制的情况下，在高等学校中采取教授治校的办法。今后凡是有关教学和学术上的重大问题，都应当由教授会来管，党委则主要负责政治思想工作。
    前南京大学校长、科学院心理研究所所长潘菽，基本上同意黄子卿教授的意见。他认为，有关教学和学术上的重大问题，都应当让教授知道并且听取他们的意见。但是过去有许多事情，教授们都不知道、也不可能知道。今后如能实行教授治校，就可以改变这种情况，并且有助于克服学校领导工作中的官僚主义，进一步在高等学校中发扬民主，对党委的工作起一种监督作用。
    楼邦彦副局长和清华大学无线电系主任孟昭英等，认为对教授治校应采取分析批判的态度，不应机械地搬用过去的作法。楼邦彦认为：清华的教授治校实质上是元老治校和寡头政治；所谓安定也只是安定了这一部分人。他说：当时清华在教授治校下的宗派主义是完全可以肯定的，除了极少数的例外，一个人如果不是留美学生，要想进清华是很困难的。1939年他从国外留学归来，当时他的老师张奚若任清华政治系主任，要他到清华任教；而他的另一位老师钱端升在北大当政治系主任，要他到北大任教。虽然当时北大给他的月薪是三百二十元，而清华只有二百八十元；但是他还是选择了清华而没有到北大，就是因为受了“清华精神”的影响。他认为，这种宗派主义决不应当在今天的高等学校中复活。同时他也不主张搬用北大的教授治校，因为当时（指1946年以后）北大的教授治校，主要是为了同胡适作斗争，为了进行教授的民主运动；而在今天的高等学校中，共产党并不是大家的斗争对象。因此他认为，教授治校虽然有好的地方，但也不应否认它有不好的地方；今天是否要提教授治校以及它的内容如何，都需要慎重地加以考虑。
    对于楼邦彦的上述意见，好几位教授在发言中都表示赞同。孟昭英说：清华的教授治校和美国的国会差不多，形式很民主，实际是少数人把持校政。北大教授周炳琳（民革中央委员，特邀参加会议）反映说：一提起教授治校，年青人的反感很大，认为是封建把头的统治。清华机械制造系教授金希武，除同意过去的教授治校是资产阶级民主外，还认为它是脱离实际的学院教育的必然产物。
    是制度不好还是思想作风问题
    在对高等学校领导工作中的缺点进行分析批判上，几乎可以说，座谈会上的意见是一致的。这就是当前高等学校领导工作中所以存在着许多缺点，主要不是党委制这个制度不好，而是党员的思想作风有许多问题，它们的集中表现就是官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义。
    许多位教授在会上分析了党员的情况。他们认为，在高等学校工作的党员一般是品质优良的，工作是积极努力的；但是也存在着许多比较严重的缺点。这主要是：第一，他们一般都还比较年轻，缺乏丰富的社会工作经验和办学经验，因而对人对事的方法比较简单，考虑问题不够周密和全面，难免不发生缺点和错误。第二，也正是由于他们一般都还比较年轻，因而在学术上的造就就比较浅薄，甚至在教学和学术方面完全是门外汉。这样，他们就不可能把党的政策方针和教学学术工作很好地结合起来，在这方面拿出比较好的主意和办法。第三，几乎可以说，过去几年对老教师采取了一概否定的态度，认为他们学的是资本主义的东西，已经过时了。其实，老教师在学术上是有造就的，在办学上许多人是有丰富经验的。
    许多教授认为，过去几年，高等学校中重政治轻业务的现象很严重；重政治当然是应该的，但是轻业务就不对了。因为高等学校是教学和学术研究机关，轻业务就不可能培养出合格的人材，就不可能提高我国的学术水平。而且所谓重政治，又认为只有党团员和青年人才可靠，老教师似乎都是思想落后、历史复杂的人，不能在政治上加以信任。这样久而久之，就不仅在党员与高级知识分子之间筑起了一道高墙，而且老教师在学校中的威望降低了。这不能不影响老教师的积极性。
    好几位教授都提到，过去学校党委管的事情多了一些，有党政不分的现象。他们认为，把企业党委制的一套搬到高等学校中来，由党委来领导和监督学校工作是不适当的，在有关教学和学术问题上，应当多听听老教师的意见。
    怎样改进领导工作
    既然今天高等学校中许多缺点的发生，主要不是因为党委制不好，而是党组织和党员的思想作风有问题，其中又主要是民主作风不够，因此多数人不主张教授治校。这主要有以下几方面的理由：第一，北大中文系教授魏建功等认为，今天高等学校的情况同过去有很大不同，政治思想教育工作占有很重要的地位，单纯依靠教授治校，不可能把学校办好。第二，北大副校长周培源认为，今天高等学校的任务是为国家培养人材，必须服从国家的需要。因此有关学校工作的方针任务问题，固然应当征求教授的意见，但最后还是要由国家来决定。回到过去的教授治校有很大困难。第三，北大教授周炳琳等认为，在高等学校的教学和学术研究上，教授占有很重要的地位；但从教学工作的数量方面看，年青的讲师助教占的比重更大。因此，不论从搞好当前的教学工作，或者培养干部的角度出发，都不应当忽视他们的意见。第四，在今天的情况下，六分之五的问题已经没有保证，如果再实行教授治校，就更没有保证；而且有许多老教师只喜欢教书，不喜欢过问行政工作。
    基于上述几方面的理由，多数人认为提民主办校比较好，而在具体的作法上又有两种意见。一种意见是主张把现在的校务委员会加以扩大，主要成员是教授、副教授，同时也吸收讲师、助教和职工参加。凡是有关校务的重大问题，都由它讨论并作出决定，再建议学校行政当局采纳执行。另一种意见基本同意上述的作法，但是主张校务委员会应成为最高决策机关，它通过的决定，校长必须执行。在校务委员的产生上，有人认为，由于学校不是政权机关，只应由校长聘请有威望有群众基础的人担任。有人则认为，不仅校务委员，就是系主任和教研室主任，都可用选举办法产生。
    北京师范大学中文系教授李长之认为，也可以同时建立教授会。因为扩大校务委员会，固然是发扬民主的方法之一；但是由于参加校务委员会的教授只是少数，教授的意见就不会得到充分的反映。同时学校既可以有学生会，当然也可以有教授会。有了教授会，不但可以充分反映教授对办学的意见，而且教授的地位提高了，教授被尊重的问题也解决了。他说：他建议这样作的目的，不是用教授治校来代替党委制，而是为了帮助党委更好地贯彻执行政策，发扬民主，克服官僚主义。
