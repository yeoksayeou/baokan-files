The Chaozhou opera from Guangdong province has come to Beijing to perform two plays adapted from local Chaozhou stories, "Chen San Wu Niang" and "Su Liu Niang." According to the original legends, the plotlines are almost the same type, and somewhat similar to "The Butterfly Lovers." However, the playwrights handled "Chen San Wu Niang" in a way that differs from "The Butterfly Lovers," and "Su Liu Niang" differs from "Chen San Wu Niang." Similar themes, different styles, enrich our country's opera stage art, concretely proving the correctness of Chairman Mao's policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new."

The reason Chao opera made the social masses look at it with new eyes was because "Chen San Wu Niang" was performed in Guangzhou in the spring of 1955. At the same time, the Minnan Liyuan Opera also came to Guangzhou to perform the same play that won an award at the East China performance. "You don't have to be an expert to know good merchandise, but you're afraid of comparing goods." After comparison, Chao opera is still excellent. Recently, the troupe rushed to compile and rehearse "Su Liu Niang" in order to report to Beijing. To be honest, on the morning of the dress rehearsal, I wasn't very interested in it, because the story wasn't far from "The Butterfly Lovers" and "Chen San Wu Niang." There was even another legend about a scholar named Wu who was tied up and thrown into the river by the clan leader for falling in love with a woman. Therefore, there is a kind of fish in Chaozhou that always swims close together, and this fish is called "Bai?" Although Su Liu Niang's lover is surnamed Guo, not Wu, the story is similar. So, it is not easy to handle it without being generalized or formulaic. The unexpected success of "Su Liu Niang" is due to this. Chao opera has overcome this difficulty, making people feel fresh and lovable. At least, I admire these two playwrights. Although the script is still rough and not as detailed as "Chen San Wu Niang," it is forgivable because it has not been processed many times.

The story of "Su Liu Niang" was originally a tragedy. The writers boldly treated it as a comedy or tragicomedy, which doesn't seem forced and the plot structure is quite complete and reasonable. Of course, it cannot be entirely attributed to the writers; it has a lot to do with the director and actors. In other words, without a good director and good actors, this play would not be easy to succeed. Director Lu Yinci is an old artist who is familiar with the performance methods of classical opera. Although he didn't have enough time to design carefully, he still grasped the characteristics of opera performance art and achieved considerable success. As for the actors, several of them are particularly worth mentioning: Su Liu Niang is the main character, but the role is not as much as the maid Tao Hua. Some people think this is a shortcoming of the script, but I don't see it that way. The established rule that the main character must have more lines can still be changed, as long as it's handled well. Now there are only two scenes specifically depicting Su Liu Niang, but if the actor can perform these two scenes well, that's enough. The young actress Yao Xuanqiu's performance in the boudoir scene is remarkable, and she expresses the inner activities very clearly. Whether a weak young lady from a landlord family can strengthen her character under the powerful oppression of the clan leader depends on one key point: whether her cousin Guo Jichun has changed his mind and engaged in another marriage. If there is no other engagement, Liu Niang will naturally strengthen herself and resist the power of the clan leader; otherwise, she will commit suicide. But suicide is not the same as not fighting at all. In that society, such suicide is a powerful protest against the feudal system. Throwing oneself into the river and being tied up and drowned are completely different. Being tied up and drowned can only illustrate the sin of the clan system; being forced to commit suicide, however, is an accusation against the clan system. The writers adopted the latter, which I think is good. Yao Xuanqiu's performance of her mood in this specific situation has also achieved something, but it is not prominent enough to highlight this meaning. Yao Xuanqiu's singing and acting style do not seem immature because of her young age. She still has certain skills, which is related to her simple nature and her willingness to learn from old artists. This is why she has become a rising star in Chao opera.

The maid Tao Hua has many scenes, and she is active on stage from beginning to end, reversing the dangerous situation and turning the tragedy into a comedy. She has wisdom, but it is not innate or premeditated. Her wisdom lies in being able to grasp the weaknesses of Liu Niang's parents and guide them according to the situation, striking the opponent's vital points with every move. Such a character is lovable and real. Because of this, this important task was actually undertaken by a young girl who had never played a leading role before. Chen Fukui unexpectedly completed the task, and even excelled at it, which made me feel that "young people are to be feared!" She is lively and playful in ordinary times (first scene), and calm and collected in emergencies. It can be said that she is just right, but her understanding of the third scene is not deep enough, and the layers are not distinct enough, but it is already difficult for her.

However, the reason why this play became a comedy does not entirely depend on the plot structure. Without a good "po dan" (old female role) and a good "chou sheng" (clown role), it would become a not-so-clever and lovable play. In Guangdong, Chao opera is the only one with the conditions. Hong Miao, who has 41 years of stage experience as a "po dan," often carefully observes old women from all walks of life and accumulates decades of experience, so she can absorb the source of creating characters from life and select the most characteristic movements and expressions to shape the image. The old wet nurse is played by him, and the appearance is similar, which is not surprising. The simple and kind character is expressed vividly through language and refined and clear movements. This is not something that actors without skills can do. The "chou sheng" Cai Kunjin, who plays Yang Ziliang, is also like this. He completely uses the acting style of the "chou sheng" in classical opera, without being either too enthusiastic or too indifferent, and he matches well with the "po dan." With these two characters, the comedy style of this play is highlighted. Guo Shimei, who plays the clan leader, Chen Shaoqing, who plays the mother, and Chen Shuihe, who plays the ferryman, can all express appropriate identities, giving the whole play a complete feeling.

Finally, I would like to mention two things that are fresh in the writing: one is that the play raises an issue that has not been written about in general operas—exposing the sins of the clan system in feudal society. This was typical in Chaozhou in the past, and probably the same in other places. As far as I have seen, very few plays touch on this issue. Even if "Su Liu Niang" is not the first time to raise it head-on, it is very fresh; the second is the ending of this play, which is unexpected, like the "lingering charm" of "The Peach Blossom Fan," truly leaving a lingering charm. Based on these two points alone, it also breaks through the formulaic nature of current opera scripts, which I think is commendable! At the same time, the whole play inherits the tradition of the ancient singing and acting style of Chao opera. The setting is simple and beautiful, and it can appropriately show the scenery of Chaozhou, which can give the audience a fresh experience.

### 潮剧的“苏六娘”

    潮剧的“苏六娘”	　董每戡
    广东潮州戏到京演出，带来了两个取材于潮州本地故事的戏“陈三五娘”和“苏六娘”，按原来传说的故事情节，几乎是同类型的，而且也有点像“梁祝姻缘”，但是被编剧家处理起来，“陈三五娘”既不同于“梁祝姻缘”；“苏六娘”又不同于“陈三五娘”，类似的题材，不同的风格，丰富了我国的戏曲舞台艺术，具体地证明了毛主席“百花齐放，推陈出新”方针的正确。
    潮剧使社会群众以另眼相看的，是因为在1955年春天在广州演出了“陈三五娘”，同时闽南梨园戏也来广州演出其在华东会演得奖的同一剧目，“不怕不识货，只怕货比货”，一比之下，潮剧仍是优秀的。最近该团因为要晋京汇报，赶编赶排了“苏六娘”。老实说，在彩排那天的上午，我对它是没有多大兴趣的，因为故事原来跟“梁祝姻缘”和“陈三五娘”的距离不远；甚至于还有另一个传说，一个姓吴的秀才因和一女的相恋被族长捆起来沉江。所以潮州有一种鱼总是前后不离地在游，这种鱼名就叫“白?”。苏六娘的爱人虽姓郭，并不姓吴，故事却是相像的，那末处理起来，不一般化公式化就很不易了， “苏六娘”的出人意外就因乎此。潮剧突破了这种困难，令人感到新鲜可爱，至少，我是佩服这两位编剧者的，虽说剧本还显得粗疏，不及“陈三五娘”那么细致，那是因为未经多次加工之故，可以原谅的。
   “苏六娘”故事原是个悲剧，编者大胆地把它作一个喜剧或悲喜剧来处理，令人看起来并不勉强，情节结构相当完整，而且入情入理。当然不能完全归功于编者，跟导演和演员的关系很大；也就是说，倘使没有好导演和好演员，这个戏是不易成功的。导演卢吟词是位老艺人，熟谙古典戏曲的演出方法，虽然因时间短促未能精心设计，还是抓到了戏曲表演艺术的特点，有了相当的成就。演员呢，在这个戏中有几位是特别值得提出来谈的：苏六娘是主要人物，戏还不如丫环桃花多，有人认为这是剧本的缺点，我不是这样看的。主要人物戏一定多些的成法还是可以变更的。只要处理得好。现在具体写苏六娘的只两场戏，但演员如果能演好这两场戏，也就够了。青年演员姚璇秋演闺房一场是可观的，内心活动表达得很清楚，一个性格比较软弱的地主家庭的小姐，在族长的强大的权势压迫之下，能不能把性格变坚强起来，就只系在一个关键上，那就是表兄郭继春有没有变心另订婚姻一点，倘使没有另订一回事，六娘自然会坚强起来反抗族长的权势；否则，就是自杀，而自杀不等于毫无斗争性，在那个社会里，这样的自杀倒正是对封建制度有力的抗议，自投江流和被捆沉江是完全不一样的，被捆沉江只能说明族长制的罪恶；被迫自杀却是向族长制提出了控诉，编者采取了后者，我以为是好的。姚璇秋表演在这特定情况下的心情也有所成就，不过还不够突出这种意义罢了。姚璇秋的唱腔做派并不因年龄幼稚而幼稚，还是有一定工力的，这跟她的秉性纯朴，虚心向老艺人学习有关，这样，她才成为潮剧的后起之秀。
    丫环桃花的戏很多，自始至终在台上活跃，扭转危局，把悲剧变为喜剧的就是她，她有智慧，但不是先天的，胸有成竹的，她的智慧就是能抓住六娘父母的弱点，因势利导，拳来脚往，击中对方要害，这样的人物是可喜爱的，也是真实的。就因为如此，这个重任居然由一个在这以前还不曾演过重头戏的小姑娘来担负，陈馥奎又出人意外地完成了任务，而且还胜任愉快，那就使我不能不感到“后生可畏”了！平常的时候她活泼顽皮（第一场），紧急的时候沉着，可说恰到好处，只第三场的体会还不够深，层次不够鲜明，但已很难为她了。
    然而这个戏之所以成为喜剧，不全赖情节结构，假使没有好婆旦和好丑生，就变成了不太聪明可喜的戏。在广东来说，潮剧是唯一有条件的，有四十一年舞台生活经验的婆旦洪妙，经常细心地观察各阶层的老妇，积数十年的体会，所以能从生活中吸取创造人物性格的源泉，选取最特征的动作表情来塑造形象，老乳媪由他饰演，外形像，不希奇；纯朴、善良的性格只凭语言和洗练明确的动作表现得淋漓尽致，这不是没有工力的演员所能办到的。饰杨子良的丑生蔡坤锦也如此，完全用古典戏曲中丑生的做派表演，不瘟不火，和婆旦配搭起来分两相称。有了这两个脚色，这个戏的喜剧风格就突出了。其他演族长的郭石梅，演母亲的陈少卿，演渡伯的陈水和，都能表演出适当的身分，整个戏予人以完整的感觉。
    最后，我还要提两点在编剧上是新鲜的东西：一是在剧中提出了一般戏曲中未写过的问题——揭露封建社会族长制的罪恶，这在过去潮州是典型的，在其他地方恐也一样。据我所看到的戏中很少触到这个问题。“苏六娘”即使不是第一次正面提出，也是很新鲜的；二是这个戏的结尾，出乎意外，像“桃花扇”的“余韵”一样真是余韵悠悠。就凭这两点，也突破了目前戏曲剧本的公式化，我认为是值得推许的！同时，整个戏继承了潮剧的古老唱腔做派的传统，装置简单而美丽，又能恰当地把潮州风光显现出来，可以一新观众的耳目。
