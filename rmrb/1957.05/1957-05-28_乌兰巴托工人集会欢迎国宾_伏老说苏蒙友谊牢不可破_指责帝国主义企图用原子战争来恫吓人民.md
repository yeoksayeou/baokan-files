Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, 27th. Chairman Voroshilov met with more than six thousand Mongolian workers at the Mongolian Industrial United Factory today and addressed them.

When Mongolian state leaders Sambu and Tsedenbal accompanied Voroshilov to the factory square, filled with colorful flags and red banners, the workers cheered in unison.

On the newly built podium, Chairman Voroshilov smiled and took the lead in applauding when he heard the female worker Dashi Tseren, who delivered the welcoming speech, say that the workers were actively working to complete the first half of the year's production plan half a month ahead of schedule to welcome Voroshilov's visit. After she finished speaking, Voroshilov cordially shook hands with her.

Voroshilov told the workers that they were very happy to meet Mongolian workers at the first factory that cultivated the Mongolian working class. Mongolia had no industry or working class before the victory of the revolution, but now the young industry is developing day by day, and the Mongolian people are using the theory of Marxism-Leninism to develop the originally backward country. The Soviet people congratulate the Mongolian people on their achievements.

Voroshilov said that they were deeply moved by the warm reception from the Mongolian working people when they arrived in this beautiful capital yesterday. At this time, the crowd shouted slogans "Long live Mongolian-Soviet friendship" and "Long live Chairman Voroshilov," followed by cheers.

Voroshilov became excited, and his voice became even louder. He said that the friendship between the Soviet and Mongolian people was written in blood in the struggle against the enemy. The enemy is afraid of our achievements because we have strength. Imperialists slander the Soviet Union for launching a war. The Soviet people once waged war to overthrow the Tsar and capitalism, so that the people could gain independence. You are the same, your people are wise, like this factory, which is now produced by your experts and workers.

In his speech, Voroshilov condemned the imperialists' attempt to intimidate the people with atomic warfare. He said that we peace-loving people must unite and work hard to protect the happy life of the people and smash the enemy's war conspiracies.

Damba, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, spoke on behalf of the Mongolian workers, saying that the Soviet Union helped Mongolia build and helped train Mongolian workers and experts. The workers all call Soviet experts "Big Brother" and "Teacher," which fully expresses Lenin-style class love. He represented the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and the workers in wishing Voroshilov a long life.

While Damba was speaking, Voroshilov gave a dove to a Mongolian elementary school student named Babu Dorji, who was wearing a red scarf, and told him that this was a peace dove and that he should take good care of it.

Afterwards, two workers from the factory presented Voroshilov with a Hada, a silver bowl, and fresh milk. Voroshilov drank the fresh milk and thanked the workers.

Voroshilov visited every workshop in the factory. Wherever he went, the workers cheered for him. The workers gave him a small suitcase they had made. Voroshilov said humorously, "We have increased your burden." This sentence caused a burst of laughter.

Afterwards, Voroshilov visited the Central Museum and took photos with representatives from various Mongolian provinces who came to welcome him in front of the museum.

This morning, Sambu, Chairman of the Presidium of the Great People's Hural of Mongolia, paid a return visit to Voroshilov.

    乌兰巴托工人集会欢迎国宾
    伏老说苏蒙友谊牢不可破
    指责帝国主义企图用原子战争来恫吓人民
    新华社乌兰巴托27日电　伏罗希洛夫主席今天在蒙古工业联合工厂同六千多名蒙古工人见面，并且向工人们讲了话。
    当蒙古国家领导人桑布和泽登巴尔等陪着伏罗希洛夫来到满布彩旗和红布标语的工厂广场的时候，工人们齐声欢呼。
    伏罗希洛夫主席在新搭的讲台上听到致欢迎词的女工达西策布说到工人们为了欢迎伏罗希洛夫的访问，正在为提前半个月完成上半年生产计划而积极劳动的时候，他微笑着带头鼓起掌来。等她讲完话后，伏罗希洛夫亲切地同她握手。
    伏罗希洛夫向工人们说，他们来到培养蒙古工人阶级的第一个工厂会见了蒙古工人，感到很高兴。蒙古在革命胜利前没有工业，也没有工人阶级，现在年轻的工业正一天比一天发展，蒙古人民运用马克思列宁主义的理论，使原来落后的国家向前发展。苏联人民祝贺蒙古人民所取得的成就。
    伏罗希洛夫说，他们昨天来到这个美丽的首都，蒙古劳动人民的热情接待使他们深受感动。这时，全场喊起了“蒙苏友谊万岁”和“伏罗希洛夫主席万岁”的口号，接着是一片欢呼声。
    伏罗希洛夫激动起来，他的嗓音越发洪亮了。他说，苏蒙两国人民的友谊是在对敌斗争中用鲜血写成的，敌人害怕我们的成绩，因为我们有力量。帝国主义诬蔑苏联要发动战争，苏联人民曾经为推翻沙皇和资本主义而进行过战争，使人民得到了独立。你们也是一样，你们的人民是有智慧的，像这个工厂，现在就是由你们的专家和工人进行生产的。
    伏罗希洛夫在讲话中斥责了帝国主义企图用原子战争来恫吓人民。他说，我们爱好和平的人民，要团结起来努力劳动，保卫人民的幸福生活，粉碎敌人的战争阴谋。
    蒙古人民革命党中央委员会第一书记达姆巴代表蒙古工人讲话说，苏联帮助蒙古建设，帮助培养了蒙古的工人和专家，工人们都称呼苏联专家为“大哥”、“老师”，这充分表达了列宁式的阶级友爱。他代表蒙古人民革命党和工人祝伏罗希洛夫长寿。
    伏罗希洛夫在达姆巴讲话的时候，把一只鸽子送给一个带红领巾的蒙古小学生巴布道尔吉，并且告诉他说，这是和平鸽，你要好好把它养大。
    随后，工厂的两个工人向伏罗希洛夫献哈达、银碗和鲜奶。伏罗希洛夫把鲜奶喝完，并且向工人致谢。
    伏罗希洛夫参观了这个工厂的每一个车间。他走到那里，那里的工人就向他欢呼。工人们把自己做的一只小皮箱送给他。伏罗希洛夫有风趣地说：“我们增加了你们的负担了”。这句话引起了一阵欢笑。
    随后，伏罗希洛夫又到中央博物馆参观，并且同来欢迎他的蒙古各省代表等在博物馆门前照了像。
    今天上午，蒙古大人民呼拉尔主席团主席桑布回拜了伏罗希洛夫。
