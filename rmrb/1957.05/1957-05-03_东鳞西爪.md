    In the Ketemilik oil-bearing structure of the Qaidam Basin, a medium-depth well gushed a large amount of crude oil during drilling on April 29. This is the first good news from the Qinghai Petroleum Exploration Bureau's drilling work this year.
    This oil-bearing structure is located in the central part of the Mangai structural area. In the past, many geologists believed that the Tertiary strata here were thickly deposited and the oil layers were relatively deep. However, this well only drilled a little over thirty-eight meters before gushing crude oil. According to tests, 73% of pure oil can be distilled from the initially gushing crude oil, which contains more impurities. According to a geologist, there must be shallow oil layers in this structure.

    The first batch of 817 bolts of printed Tussah silk from the Liaoning Tussah Silk Company has been shipped out to supply markets in Tianjin, Wuhan, Xuzhou, Qingdao, Jinan, and other places. Tussah silk has special properties, and China has never printed on it before. After learning and researching, the Liaoning Tussah Silk Company finally succeeded in trial printing. This year, the company will produce nearly ten thousand bolts of printed Tussah silk, with more than sixty patterns and designs, to supply the domestic market and prepare for export.
    Because Tussah silk itself has a special luster, the printed colored patterns appear particularly bright. Women use it to make summer clothes, which are both beautiful and cool. According to tests, the color fastness reaches level three or above, and it does not fade even when washed with soapy water.
    Hegang
    In the northernmost Hegang Coal Mine of our country, another pair of fully mechanized new inclined shafts—Continental No. 2 inclined shafts—were officially handed over for production. The quality of the entire project is excellent.
    This pair of inclined shafts was designed by Chinese engineers and technicians. Its degree of mechanization and in-shaft equipment are similar to those of the New No. 1 Mine, which has already been built. The designed output is equivalent to one-third of the New No. 1 Mine, but the construction cost is only one-sixth of the New No. 1 Mine.
    Zhengzhou
    The state-owned Zhengzhou No. 4 Cotton Textile Factory, with 85,000 spindles and 3,700 automatic looms, officially went into production on the 1st.
    According to its production capacity, the cloth woven by this factory each year is enough for more than 20 million people to make a new outfit each. It possesses high-speed warping machines and reed pullers, recently produced by China's textile machinery factories, and is currently the most well-equipped textile factory in our country.
    Mianyang
    China's first semi-automated filature factory has been built in Mianyang and began partial production on the 29th.
    The Mianyang Filature Factory has five workshops: cocoon selection and peeling, cocoon cooking, silk reeling, waste silk recovery, and sorting and inspection of waste. The silk reeling machines consist of thirty sets, and all equipment is made in Japan, with an annual silk output of 2,400 metric tons.
    Sichuan's silk production ranks second in the country. The existing five silk spinning factories, silk reeling factories, and silk factories are still semi-handicraft in nature. The completion of this factory marks the beginning of the technological transformation of Sichuan Province's silk reeling industry in the future. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    柴达木
    柴达木盆地开特米里克储油构造上的一口中深井，4月29日在钻井过程中喷出了大量原油。这是青海石油勘探局今年钻探工作中传出的首次捷报。
    这个储油构造在茫崖构造区的中部。过去很多地质专家都认为这里的第三纪地层沉积厚，油层比较深。但是，这口井只钻到三十八公尺多一点就喷出了原油。据化验，从初喷出的含杂质较多的原油中能馏分出73％的纯油。据一位地质师说，这个构造上肯定有浅油层存在。
    安东
    我国第一批八百十七匹印花柞蚕丝绸从辽宁柞蚕丝绸公司运出，供应天津、武汉、徐州、青岛、济南等地市场销售。柞蚕丝绸性能特殊，我国一向没有印过花。辽宁柞蚕丝绸公司经过学习、研究，终于试印成功。这个公司今年将生产近万匹印花柞蚕丝绸，共有六十多种花纹图案，除供应国内市场外，并准备出口。
    柞蚕丝绸由于本身有一种特殊光色，印上彩色花纹图案，显得格外鲜艳。妇女们用来缝制夏服，既美丽，又凉爽。据鉴定证明，颜色牢度达三级以上，肥皂水擦洗也不掉色。
    鹤岗
    我国最北部的鹤岗煤矿，一日又有一对全部机械化的新型斜井——大陆二号斜井正式移交生产。全部工程质量优良。
    这对斜井是由我国工程技术人员设计的，它同早已建成的新一矿的机械化程度和井内设备相差不多，设计产量相等于新一矿的三分之一，但建设费用只有新一矿的六分之一。
    郑州
    拥有八万五千枚纱锭和三千七百台自动布机的国营郑州第四棉纺织厂，1日正式投入生产。
    按照生产能力，这个厂每年织成的布够两千多万人各做一身新衣。它拥有我国纺织机械厂新近出产的高速整经机和穿筘用的拨头器等，是当前我国设备最完善的一个纺织厂。
    绵阳
    我国第一座半自动化的缫丝厂已经在绵阳建成，29日开始局部生产。
    绵阳缫丝厂共有选剥、煮茧、缫丝、扬返和整理检验屑物等五个车间，缫丝机器有三十组，全部设备都是日本制造，能年产丝二千四百公担。
    四川蚕丝产量占全国第二位，现有的五个丝纺厂、制丝厂和丝绸厂，生产仍然属于半手工业性质。这个厂的建成，是今后四川省缫丝工业技术改造的开端。（据新华社讯）
