    Visiting Chairman Groza
    By our correspondent Ding Man
    On my desk, a book with a picture of the Huabiao columns of Tiananmen in Beijing on its cover catches my attention. The title of the book is "In the Country of 600 Million People," and the author is none other than Dr. Petru Groza, Chairman of the Presidium of the Grand National Assembly of the Romanian People's Republic, well-known to the Chinese people. After Chairman Groza's visit to China in 1954, he took time out of his busy schedule to write this book. I heard that he did not even interrupt his writing while he was ill. This book, which is 340 pages long, was published in August 1956 and was immediately praised by readers. Readers can understand the new China from political, economic, cultural, and life aspects through Chairman Groza's impressions and feelings about his visit to China, and feel the author's love for China between the lines.
    For a long time, I have been looking forward to meeting Chairman Groza, the author of "In the Country of 600 Million People." Some time ago, Chairman Groza was unwell. Recently, I heard that he had recovered his health, so my wish came true.
    One day, in a spacious and simple office, Chairman Groza received me. He had silver hair and was full of energy. On a conference table opposite his desk was a photo of him and Chairman Mao Zedong together. Throughout the reception, the old man's kindness and humor made me feel completely at ease. I first inquired about Chairman Groza's health. He first said to the reporter: "I especially thank the Chinese friends for their concern for me. When I was lying in bed, my secretary and doctor conveyed the concern of ordinary Chinese citizens and leading comrades headed by Chairman Mao Zedong for me." He said that this concern greatly encouraged him and prompted his body to recover and continue to work for the happiness of the Romanian people.
    Talking about Sino-Romanian friendship, he said very modestly: "The friendship between us is the friendship between the great Chinese people and the small Romanian people." He said that our friendship has roots. In order to defend ourselves and build a new happy life together, we are uniting more and more closely. Continuing to deepen our friendship is important not only to us, but to the whole world. Our connection is not only material, but also spiritual. He emphasized: "The connection of the heart" can only be achieved through mutual understanding, and "people who understand each other can love each other." When he talked about this, one of his female secretaries sitting next to him said to the reporter: "The Chairman often says this sentence."
    Chairman Groza continued: "In this regard, our cultural ties play a very important role." He pointed out that both China and Romania have ancient cultural traditions and have made considerable contributions to mankind. He said: No force can stop us from respecting and loving each other.
    Chairman Groza was very happy that Romania could help the Chinese people in oil production. At the same time, he was also happy that scholars, writers, and art groups from the two countries could feel like they were at home when they visited each other.
    When I told Chairman Groza that he had made great contributions to promoting Sino-Romanian friendship, he said very modestly that he had only done a little bit to satisfy the Romanian people's desire to know more about the Chinese people. He talked about his trip to China, and he said: "I went to your great country with some experience, because our people's democratic system was established earlier than China's. But I certainly came back as a primary school student. I learned a lot in your country. I feel that I have a responsibility to spread what I have seen as widely as possible in our country."
    Chairman Groza also talked about the issue of strengthening unity between socialist countries. He said that the enemy is preparing for war, and socialist countries should build a truly invincible fortress, which will guarantee the progress of mankind.
    Chairman Groza talked and laughed, appearing relaxed and happy. You couldn't tell that he had just recovered from a serious illness. Our conversation had unknowingly lasted for an hour and a half, which had long exceeded the time allowed by the doctor. When the reporter bid farewell to Chairman Groza, he asked the reporter to convey his respect to the Chinese people and the leading comrades headed by Chairman Mao Zedong.
    After bidding farewell to Chairman Groza, I rested for a while in his secretary's office. Afterwards, Chairman Groza went home to rest, and the secretary invited me to visit the Chairman's office. The furnishings of the office deepened the kind impression that the old man left in my heart. I saw that on his rectangular desk, in addition to an interesting brown goose quill pen and office supplies, a small and exquisite coal car model filled with coal, which was given to him by the coal miners of the Jiu River Valley in Romania, was placed on one corner of the desk; under the glass panel on the other end, there were three photos placed side by side: one of him and his wife and children, one of him and a group of farmers, and one of him next to a memorial statue of a national hero in ancient times who opposed the Roman invasion. On the platforms erected in the two corners of the room were placed models of the airplanes manufactured by Voia and Vlăicu, the earliest two Romanian aircraft manufacturers in 1906 and 1912. On the front wall of the office hung Romania's gilded national emblem, on the right hung a giant statue of Comrade Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, and on the front hung two moving oil paintings by Romanian classical painters.
    The secretary said: "Everything in the office is the Chairman's favorite and most interested in." (Attached picture)

    访格罗查主席
    	本报记者　丁曼
    在我的书桌上，一本封面上印有北京天安门华表的书吸引着我的注意。书名是“在六亿人民的国家”，作者就是中国人民所熟知的罗马尼亚人民共和国大国民议会主席团主席彼·格罗查博士。1954年格罗查主席访问中国回来后，就在百忙中抽出时间来写了这本书，听说他在生病期间也没有中断过写作。这本厚达三百四十页的书在1956年8月问世以后，立刻得到了读者的赞赏。读者可以通过格罗查主席写下的访华观感和印象，从政治、经济、文化、生活各方面认识新的中国，并在字里行间感到作者对于中国的热爱。
    很久以来，我就期望着能见见“在六亿人民的国家”的作者格罗查主席。前些时候，格罗查主席身体欠安。最近听说他已恢复健康，于是我的愿望实现了。
    一天，在一间宽敞而简朴的办公室里，格罗查主席接见了我。他头发银白，神采奕奕。在他的办公桌对面的一张会客桌上，放着他和毛泽东主席合摄的照片。在整个接见期间，格老的平易可亲和富有风趣，使我一点也不觉得拘束。我首先问候了格罗查主席的健康。他首先对记者说：“我特别感谢中国朋友对我的关心。当我躺在病床上的时候，我的秘书和医生转达了普通中国公民和以毛泽东主席为首的领导同志对我的关怀。”他说，这种关怀使他感到莫大的鼓舞，促使他的身体恢复健康，为罗马尼亚人民的幸福继续工作。
    谈到中罗友谊，他十分谦虚地说：“我们之间的友谊是伟大的中国人民和小的罗马尼亚人民之间的友谊。”他说，我们的友谊是有根源的，为了保卫我们自己，为了共同建设新的幸福生活，我们日益紧密地团结起来。继续加深我们的友谊，不仅对我们，对全世界都是重要的。我们的联系不仅有物质方面的，而且也包括精神方面的。他强调指出：“心灵”的联系是通过互相了解才能达到的，“互相了解的人才能互爱。”他谈到这里的时候，坐在旁边的他的一位女秘书向记者说：“主席经常讲这句话。”
    格罗查主席继续说：“在这方面，我们的文化联系就起很大的作用。”他指出中国和罗马尼亚两个国家都有古老的文化传统，对人类作了相当大的贡献。他说：没有任何力量能够阻挡我们互相尊重，互相敬爱。
    格罗查主席对于罗马尼亚能够在石油生产方面帮助中国人民，感到很高兴。同时，两国的学者、作家、艺术团体在互相访问时能够感到像在自己家里一样，这也使他高兴。
    当我向格罗查主席说他在促进中罗友谊上有很大贡献的时候，他十分谦虚地表示，他不过做了一点点事情，来满足罗马尼亚人民想要更多地了解中国人民的愿望。他谈到了他的中国之行，他说：“我是带着一些经验到你们伟大的国家里去的，因为我们的人民民主制度比中国建立得早一些。但我肯定地是作为一个小学生回来了，我在你们的国家里，学了很多东西。我感到自己有责任把我所看到的在我国尽量广泛地传播。”
    格罗查主席还谈到了社会主义国家之间应当加强团结的问题。他说，敌人正在准备战争，社会主义国家之间应当建立起一个真正不可征服的堡垒，这个堡垒将会保证人类的进步。
    格罗查主席边谈边笑，显得轻松愉快，一点也看不出他是刚生过大病。我们的谈话不知不觉已经过了一个半小时。早已超过了医生许可的时间了。记者在向格罗查主席告别的时候，他要记者转达他对中国人民和以毛泽东主席为首的领导同志的敬意。
    同格罗查主席告别后，我在他的秘书室里休息了片刻。随后，格罗查主席回家休息，秘书同志又邀我参观了主席的办公室。办公室的陈设更加深了这位老人在我心中留下的亲切的印象。我看到，在他的长方形办公桌上，除去放着一支令人感到兴趣的褐色鹅翎笔和办公用具以外，桌子的一角还放着罗马尼亚纪乌河谷煤炭工人送给他的一个小巧精致的满载煤炭的煤车模型；另一头的玻璃板下，并排放着他和他的妻子及儿女们、他和一群农民们以及他在一个古代反对罗马人入侵的民族英雄的纪念像旁照的三张像片。在两个屋角竖立的台子上，放着1906年和1912年罗马尼亚最早的两位飞机制造家沃雅和弗拉丘制造的飞机模型。办公室正面墙壁上挂着罗马尼亚的镀金的国徽，右面挂着乔治乌—德治同志的巨像，正前面挂着罗马尼亚古典画家的两幅动人的油画。
    秘书同志说：“办公室里的这一切，都是主席最喜爱、最感兴趣的。”（附图片）
