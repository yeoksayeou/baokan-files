Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 3rd. Leaders at all levels in Anhui Province are actively participating in labor production, with good results.

    In the Bengbu Special Zone, forty-three CPC county secretaries have already participated in labor production. Whenever Gong Xianrong, the county secretary of Si County, returns from inspecting work in the countryside, he carries a full manure basket on his back. When the members of the Red Star Agricultural Cooperative see this, they say: "Since Secretary Gong is carrying a manure basket, we must greatly increase our manure accumulation work." In less than ten days, the entire cooperative accumulated more than 1.8 million catties of fertilizer. Xue Zhaoben, the county secretary of Dangshan County, personally carried urine fertilizer to the Longhai Agricultural Cooperative for wheat topdressing. Under his influence, cadres of the Dangshan County direct organs also participated in the labor of delivering fertilizer. Now, they are delivering more than 5,000 catties of urine fertilizer to agricultural cooperatives near the county seat every day. Xu Shengbang, the county secretary and county head of Suixi County, often saw that animal manure in front of and behind many houses in the villages was not being collected. Although he had mobilized the peasants to collect manure more than once, the peasants' habit of not accumulating fertilizer could not be changed for a while. Later, he thought: "The Party often teaches us to integrate with the masses and change our leadership style. Now, we should first set an example and get to work, and use our own actions to influence and motivate the masses." So, starting in January of this year, he took the lead in carrying a manure basket and picking up manure. Subsequently, deputy county secretaries, the Minister of Propaganda, and the Minister of Finance and Trade, and other leading cadres also carried manure baskets to collect manure. Many district and township cadres and peasants were very moved and said that they would do the same. Ma Weicong, the captain of the first production team of the Unity First Agricultural Cooperative, now gets up to pick up manure every day as soon as the east turns white. The production team he leads has accumulated 145,000 catties of fertilizer in more than twenty days, which is more than 40,000 catties more than the entire winter last year. Wang Shihao, the county head of Yuexi County, often helps peasants carry sand and deliver fertilizer during spring plowing, and is warmly praised. In February of this year, when he was leading the rectification work in the Baisha Agricultural Cooperative, he spent a certain amount of time every day helping the members carry sand, without interruption for twenty days. Recently, he also led the cadres of the County People's Committee to formulate a plan to regularly deliver fertilizer to nearby agricultural cooperatives. According to this plan, the human and animal manure and garbage of the County People's Committee organs this year, in addition to leaving a small part for the organs' own production use, will be mostly given to nearby agricultural cooperatives free of charge. On April 4th and 14th, Wang Shihao led the cadres of the County People's Committee to deliver the first and second batches of more than 350 loads of human and animal manure to the Five-Star Agricultural Cooperative. Yu Baohe, the director of the Five-Star Agricultural Cooperative, and Chen Binglan, the production team leader, expressed their heartfelt gratitude to Wang Shihao and said: We must consolidate the results of the rectification, run the cooperative well, and achieve this year's agricultural production plan. Originally, some cadres disliked manure as being dirty and were unwilling to carry it. Seeing County Head Wang personally carrying manure to the agricultural cooperative load by load, they consciously criticized this erroneous idea.

    Responsible cadres of the CPC Anhui Provincial Committee and the Anhui Provincial People's Committee also use their spare time and opportunities to work in the countryside to participate in labor production. The first secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, Zeng Xisheng, and the governor, Huang Yan, and others have participated in building pig pens, reclaiming wasteland to grow vegetables and other crops. In early April, to prevent frost damage, Vice Governor Wang Guangyu and the peasants of Fengtai County smoked seedlings together to prevent frost damage. When Zhang Shirong, the Minister of the Rural Work Department of the Provincial Party Committee, went to Chaoxian County to help with work, he watered crops with the peasants to prevent drought. Zheng Rui, the Deputy Secretary-General of the Provincial Party Committee, also helped the peasants of the Nangang Agricultural Cooperative in the suburbs of Hefei City to build water conservancy projects.

    以身作则干起来！
    安徽各级领导干部带头参加生产
    据新华社合肥3日电  安徽省各级领导干部纷纷参加劳动生产，影响很好。
    蚌埠专区已经有四十三名中共县委书记参加了劳动生产。泗县县委书记龚显荣每次下乡检查工作回来，都背着满粪箕子的粪。红星农业社的社员们看见了，都说：龚政委都背起了粪箕子，我们的积粪工作要大干起来。不到十天的时间，全社就积肥一百八十多万斤。砀山县委书记薛兆本亲自把尿肥挑着送给陇海农业社，进行小麦追肥。在他的影响下，砀山县直属机关干部也都参加了送肥的劳动，现在每天挑送给县城附近农业社的尿肥有五千多斤。濉溪县委书记、濉溪县县长徐圣邦经常看见很多庄上屋前屋后的牲畜粪没有人拾，虽然不只一次动员农民拾粪，可是农民不积肥的习惯一时总改变不过来。后来他想：“党经常教导我们要同群众打成一片，改变领导作风。现在应该首先以身作则地干起来，以自己的行动来影响和带动群众。”于是从今年1月份起，他就带头背着粪箕拾起粪来了。接着，县委副书记、宣传部副部长和财贸部长等领导干部也都背起了粪箕子拾粪。很多区、乡干部和农民都很感动，表示也要这样做。团结第一农业社第一生产队队长马维从，现在每天东方刚发白就起来拾粪。他领导的生产队在二十多天里积肥十四万五千多斤，比去年整个一冬还多积了四万多斤。岳西县县长王诗豪在春耕生产中经常帮助农民挑沙和送粪，受到热烈的赞扬。今年2月，他在白沙农业社领导整社工作时，每天抽出一定时间帮助社员挑沙，二十天中一天也没有间断。最近，他又领导县人民委员会的干部，订了一个经常给附近农业社送粪的计划。按照这个计划，县人民委员会机关今年的人畜粪和垃圾，除留下小部分供机关生产使用外，大部分都要无偿地送给附近的农业社。4月4日和14日两天，王诗豪带领县人民委员会的干部，把第一、二批三百五十多担人畜粪送到五星农业社。五星农业社社长余保和、生产队长陈炳兰怀着十分感激的心情，向王诗豪表示：一定要巩固整社的成果，把社办好，实现今年的农业生产计划。原来有些干部嫌大粪脏，不愿挑大粪，看到王县长亲自把大粪一担一担往农业社里挑，都自觉地批判了这种错误思想。
    中共安徽省委员会和安徽省人民委员会的负责干部也利用业余时间和下乡工作的机会，参加劳动生产。省委第一书记曾希圣和省长黄岩等人都参加砌圈养猪、开荒种植蔬菜和其他农作。4月上旬防霜防冻，副省长王光宇和凤台县的农民一起向青苗田里熏烟防冻。省委农村工作部部长张世荣到巢县帮助工作时，和农民一起车水防旱。省委副秘书长郑锐也帮助合肥市郊区南岗农业社的农民兴修水利。
