    New Highway on a 4,000-Meter High Mountain
    By our reporter Li Ce

    In the Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Sichuan Province is investing in the construction of a highway from Dong'e Luo to Batang. The route starts from Dong'e Luo, crosses the turbulent Yalong River, climbs the Daliang Mountains, then passes through dense primeval forests to Litang. Litang is 4,100 meters above sea level and is the highest city in our country. The route passes through the vast natural grassland area of the Litang plateau, then goes west, crosses the Jianziwan Mountain, which is 4,400 meters above sea level, and begins to descend until it reaches Batang on the east bank of the Jinsha River. The entire line is 400 kilometers long, half of which winds through high mountain areas above 4,000 meters. This year, it is planned to build from Dong'e Luo to Litang, a total of 199 kilometers.

    The Dongba Highway is actually the southern route of the future Kangzang Highway. Currently, a highway is being built eastward from Zogongzong in Tibet. It is expected that around 1958, it will pass through Ningjing County, cross the Jinsha River, and meet the Dongba Highway in Batang. This is a more economical and reasonable route from the mainland to Tibet.

    In the Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, high mountains are separated by deep valleys, and deep valleys are separated by high mountains. The towering mountains, deep valleys, and rapid currents, arranged vertically from north to south in undulating waves, are the most typical mountainous area in our country. Transportation between the east and west is particularly difficult, relying on inherent transportation tools: cattle hide rafts, bamboo rope bridges, and ferries on turbulent rivers; yaks and mules in mountainous areas. Local people have this legend: "If two people driving yaks meet on a rugged path, they cannot give way, nor can they turn around. Then, after the two people discuss it, they see whose yak is cheaper and sell it to the other person. Then push the cow into the deep valley to make way." Regardless of the truth of this legend, it reflects the general situation of local transportation difficulties. The climate is also not conducive to transportation. There is a saying: "In the first, second, and third months, the mountains are covered by snow; in the fourth, fifth, and sixth months, the mud is over your feet; the seventh, eighth, and ninth months are good for walking; in the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth months, you learn to crawl like a dog." Inconvenient transportation hinders the smooth flow of materials, and the economic and cultural development of the Tibetan people is also limited to a certain extent. After the Dongba Highway is completed, it will become the main transportation artery in the central part of the Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, which will inevitably further promote changes in the lives of the Tibetan people in this area.

    Last July, survey personnel set off to survey the route in uninhabited areas. The climate in the high mountain area changes unpredictably from morning to night. People describe the local climate as "wearing fur coats in the morning and gauze in the afternoon; holding a stove and eating watermelon." In winter, there is a vast expanse of snow. If you don't wear colored glasses and stay in the wild for a long time, you will become colorblind. After half a year of effort, they selected a more economical and reasonable route and rushed to the front of the construction site. This year, they will advance westward from Litang to complete the survey of the entire line.

    Zhang Jiasheng, chief engineer of the Sichuan Provincial Highway Construction Engineering Bureau, said that the amount of earth and stone work on the entire line is not large, but this highway is being built in remote areas, and materials and supplies must be moved there from the mainland. Coupled with the relatively bad climatic conditions, the engineering task is arduous. During this year's dry season, the bridge piers of the Yalong River Bridge must be built out of the water, otherwise it will affect the progress of the entire project. The bridge construction team arrived at the construction site in mid-February and began construction. The river surface of the Yalong River is only 80 meters wide here, but the river water is surging, and the flow rate is seven meters per second. It is not possible to cross the river by ferry, and it is also difficult to build a bridge. In the late Qing Dynasty, the executioner Zhao Erfeng also wanted to build a bridge here. He asked the French to build only a steel cable bridge on the river. Less than two years later, a mutiny occurred and the bridge was destroyed. Last year, only two steel bars remained in front of the Dong'an River Estuary Government. He said that Zhao Erfeng built the bridge to rule the Tibetan people, and we are building the bridge to support the various constructions of the Tibetan people, and we will definitely build it faster and better than in the past.

    According to the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy, they determined that the standard of this highway should be Grade 6, and adopted the method of phased construction and reverse section construction, that is, build a section and use a section. In this way, the investment is small, the effect is great, it does not affect the initial transportation task, and it will be easy to carry out reconstruction and improve the standard in the future.

### 四千公尺高山上的新公路

    四千公尺高山上的新公路
    本报记者　李策
    在甘孜藏族自治州，四川省正投资修建一条从东俄洛到巴塘的公路。线路从东俄洛起，跨过湍急的雅砻江，爬上大凉山脉，然后穿过密层层的原始森林，走到理塘。理塘拔海四千一百公尺，是我国第一座最高的城市。线路走过广阔的理塘高地天然草原地带，再往西走，翻越四千四百公尺的尖子湾大山，开始走向下坡，直到金沙江东岸的巴塘。全线长四百公里，其中有一半的线路盘旋在四千公尺以上的高山地带。今年计划从东俄洛修到理塘，共一百九十九公里。
    东巴公路实际上就是未来的康藏公路的南路。现在，从西藏境内的左贡宗正向东修建一条公路，预计在1958年前后，就可以经过宁静县，跨过金沙江，在巴塘同东巴公路相会。这是一条从内地到西藏比较经济合理的路线。
    在甘孜藏族自治州，高山夹着深谷，深谷又夹着高山。崇山峻岭，深谷急流，南北纵列，波浪起伏，是我国最典型的山区。东、西之间交通往来特别困难，利用着固有的交通工具：在湍急的河流上是牛皮筏，竹索桥，摆渡；山区是牦牛，骡马。当地人民有这样的传说：“有两个赶牦牛的人，在崎岖的羊肠小道上碰见了，不能让路，不能调头，那末，两个人商量以后，看哪个人的牦牛价钱便宜，卖给对方。然后把牛推到深谷里，让出路来。”不管这种传说的真实程度有多大，它毕竟反映了当地交通困难的概况。气候也不利于交通运输，有句歌谣是：“正二三，雪封山；四五六，泥没脚；七八九，正好走；十冬腊，学狗爬。”交通不便，就妨碍了物资畅流，藏族人民的经济、文化的发展也受到了一定的限制。东巴公路修通以后，就成了甘孜藏族自治州中部的主要交通干线，它必然会进一步促进这一带藏族人民生活面貌的变化。
    去年7月，勘查人员就出发了，在荒无人烟的地区勘查线路。高山地区早晚的气候变化无常。人们形容当地的气候是“早穿皮袍，午穿纱；怀抱火炉，吃西瓜”。冬季是白茫茫的积雪，不带有色眼镜，在野外呆久了，就会变成色盲。他们经过半年的努力，选择出来一条比较经济合理的线路，并且赶到了施工的前边，今年从理塘向西前进，完成全线的勘查任务。
    四川省公路建筑工程局总工程师张家声同志说，全线土石方数量并不大，但是这条公路是在边远地区修建的，物资、给养都要从内地搬到那里，加上气候条件比较坏，因此工程任务就艰巨了。在今年枯水期，要把雅砻江大桥的桥墩修出水面，否则就会影响全线工程进度。筑桥工程队在2月中旬到达工地，开始施工。雅砻江的江面，在这里仅宽八十公尺，但是江水汹涌奔腾，每秒钟流速是七公尺。汽车过江用渡船是不行的，修桥也比较困难。清朝末年，刽子手赵尔丰也想在此修一座桥，他请法国人仅在江面上修了一条钢索桥，不到两年，发生兵变，把桥炸毁。去年仅剩下两根钢条摆在东岸河口区政府门前。他说赵尔丰修桥，是为了统治西藏人民，我们修桥是支援西藏人民的各项建设，一定比过去修的更快，更好。
    他们根据增产节约的精神，确定这条公路标准为六级，采取分期修建、翻段施工的办法，就是修一段，用一段。这样，投资少，效果大，不影响初期的运输任务，将来再实行改建，提高标准也是容易的。（附图片）
