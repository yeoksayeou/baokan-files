Ethnic Work Cadres in Beijing Hold Symposium
Opposing Great Han Chauvinist Tendencies

Editor's Note: Recently, the editorial department of this newspaper invited ethnic work cadres from various places who came to Beijing for meetings to hold a symposium on the topic of "How to Overcome Great Han Chauvinist Tendencies." Now, we have organized the minutes of the symposium by issue and published them here. The issues raised at the meeting are not definitive conclusions, and further discussions can be continued if there are different opinions.

The Main Problems in Current Domestic Ethnic Relations

What are the main problems in current domestic ethnic relations?

Regarding this question, the understanding of the comrades present at the meeting was not entirely consistent. Some believe that the main problem in the current ethnic relations is the de facto inequality that exists between all ethnic groups, especially between the Han and minority ethnic groups. The reason is that the socialist transformation has been basically completed in most parts of the country, and the class foundation of ethnic oppression has been basically eliminated, and about 90% of the concentrated minority ethnic groups have implemented regional autonomy; however, the de facto inequality between ethnic groups in economic and cultural aspects, which has been left over by history, still exists, and it cannot be completely eliminated in a short period of time. If the Han people do not vigorously help the minority ethnic groups solve this problem, it will be detrimental to ethnic unity. Therefore, this issue should be given top priority in the future.

There is also an opinion that the main problem at present is that the autonomous rights of minority ethnic groups have not been fully realized, which is the focus of the relationship between the Han and minority ethnic groups. To enhance ethnic unity, the autonomous rights of ethnic autonomous areas must be fully realized. Some believe that this statement is not accurate enough. In fact, this is just a major manifestation of the political inequality left over by history that has not been completely eliminated.

Another opinion is that the main problem in current ethnic relations is the estrangement between the minority ethnic groups and the Han people, and Great Han chauvinism is the main danger in current ethnic relations. Therefore, it is necessary to resolutely oppose Great Han chauvinist tendencies. Local nationalism tendencies also exist and should also be prevented and overcome; however, this must be carried out on the basis of focusing on overcoming Great Han chauvinism. There is no disagreement on this point.

An important manifestation of Great Han chauvinism at present is that the autonomous rights of minority ethnic groups have not been fully realized, and some autonomous organs are more in name than in fact, or even exist in name only. The most prominent is the issue of the autonomous rights of ethnic autonomous prefectures. Some higher-level state organs have not strictly distinguished between autonomous prefectures and general special districts. When they issue notices, they often do not go through the autonomous prefecture, but directly issue them to the county. The issues of financial power, military power, and the powers of minority ethnic cadres in autonomous prefectures have not been resolved for a long time. The Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture in Guangxi Province and the Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Prefecture in Guangdong Province both had this problem to varying degrees in the past. Another important manifestation is that the customs, habits, and beliefs of minority ethnic groups have not been given due respect. For example, last year, when a prospecting team was drilling for coal reserves in the Huzhu Tu Autonomous County of Qinghai Province, they destroyed a "naobao" without consulting the local Tu people in advance. This "naobao" was considered a "sacred mountain" by the local Tu people. The minority ethnic groups in the mountainous areas of Hainan Island generally "rely on the mountains to eat the mountains," but in some places, when mountains were closed for afforestation, new ways of life were not found for them in advance, which made their lives difficult for a time. In some places where there are scattered minority ethnic groups, the phenomenon that their customs and habits are not respected is even more serious due to the small number of minority ethnic groups. For example, the Han people in the inland have insufficient respect for the customs and habits of the scattered Hui people. These situations have damaged ethnic unity and affected work to a certain extent.

Has Great Han Chauvinist Thought Grown?

During the symposium, everyone reflected that the manifestations of Great Han chauvinism have increased in the past two years. However, does this indicate that Great Han chauvinist thought has grown? There are not entirely the same views. Some believe that thoughts and manifestations cannot be viewed in isolation. The increase in the manifestations of Great Han chauvinism is a direct exposure of the growth of Great Han chauvinist thought. Some comrades also believe that the manifestations of Great Han chauvinism can be said to have increased, but they do not agree with saying without analysis that Great Han chauvinist thought has also grown. The reason is that socialist transformation has made the contact between the Han people in the inland and the scattered minority ethnic groups more and more frequent. For example, 96% of the Hui farmers in Shandong Province have joined agricultural cooperatives, of which more than 90% have joined ethnic joint cooperatives. The large-scale construction in minority ethnic areas has also made some concentrated minority ethnic groups unprecedentedly increase their contact with the Han people. For example, there are now about 70,000 people in the Qaidam Basin of Qinghai Province, most of whom are Han people transferred from the inland to engage in construction. Most of them do not understand the customs and habits of minority ethnic groups and are not familiar with ethnic policies, so ethnic disputes and misunderstandings are inevitable. Secondly, in the past two years, the ideological tendencies of Great Han chauvinism have been gradually overcome in many places and among many Han cadres. This is first reflected in the achievements of ethnic work. Taking the work of training minority ethnic cadres as an example, at the beginning of liberation, there were about 10,000 minority ethnic cadres in the country, and now it has increased to more than 220,000. If you add the staff in primary and secondary schools and township-level organs, the total number is nearly 340,000. On the other hand, once shortcomings in work are discovered, they are immediately corrected. For example, in Guizhou Province, in the agricultural cooperation movement, some Han cadres, because they did not understand the customs and habits of the Miao people, and did not listen to the opinions of the minority ethnic groups well in advance, allowed some Miao people to include "Malangpo" and "old cows" into agricultural cooperatives. Last year, after they discovered this problem in the inspection of the implementation of ethnic policies, many places have now taken remedial measures. Obviously, these examples do not indicate that Great Han chauvinist thought has grown anew. Therefore, these comrades believe that: in fact, Great Han chauvinist thought has only grown anew among some Han cadres in some areas. These Han cadres often only saw the achievements of their past work, thinking that all of this was the result of the Han people helping the minority ethnic groups, and generated a sense of pride and superiority. In their work, they mechanically applied the experience of the Han areas and did not seriously listen to the opinions of the minority ethnic groups. Although the shortcomings in ethnic work in the past were not all generated under the domination of this kind of thinking, this is an important source of shortcomings and errors. Therefore, if we want to overcome the shortcomings in ethnic work in the future, we must start by opposing Great Han chauvinist thought.

The Source of Great Han Chauvinist Thought

What is the source of Great Han chauvinist thought? Some comrades said that Great Han chauvinist thought is a reflection of the ideology of the landlords and the bourgeoisie. However, it is necessary to distinguish between those who are conscious and those who are unconscious. Otherwise, arbitrarily labeling people will hurt the enthusiasm of many Han cadres. Because in fact, conscious Great Han chauvinism, such as openly discriminating against and oppressing minority ethnic groups, and thinking that it is justified, is extremely rare at present; most of them are making mistakes without even knowing it. However, even if one makes serious mistakes unconsciously, it should still be regarded as a tendency of Great Han chauvinism. Han cadres working in minority ethnic areas should always fully consider the characteristics of minority ethnic groups; failing to consider thoroughly is itself a manifestation of Great Han chauvinism. Some comrades believe that this statement will give the impression that all manifestations of Great Han chauvinist thought are reflections of the ideology of the landlords and the bourgeoisie. This statement is inappropriate and does not serve to protect the enthusiasm of Han cadres. They believe that it is better to attribute Great Han chauvinist thought to two sources: one is the historical class root - the ideology of the landlords and the bourgeoisie; the other is the root of understanding - subjectivism (empiricism and dogmatism). This can not only distinguish the nature and root of the error, but also protect the enthusiasm of the majority of Han cadres.

How to Overcome Great Han Chauvinist Tendencies

When it comes to how to overcome the tendency of Great Han chauvinism, everyone has almost no differences, only some additions to each other.

Their first opinion is: in the future, the implementation of ethnic policies should be checked frequently. The national ethnic policy implementation checks that began in 1953 and April 1956 both played a significant role in correcting shortcomings in ethnic work. However, the time between them was too long, and some problems were not discovered earlier and corrected more promptly.

The second opinion is that publicity for ethnic work must be strengthened in the future. A general feeling is that there has been too little publicity for ethnic work in the past; especially the role played by various ethnic groups in history and in the country's various constructions has been even less publicized. This is very detrimental to overcoming the sense of superiority of the major ethnic group and the sense of inferiority of the minority ethnic groups, and to strengthening understanding between the ethnic groups. For example, in the past, many newspapers and magazines rarely mentioned that Mu Xiangxiong, China's swimming star, was a Hui. Those who paid attention to this aspect of publicity have all received good results. For example, some students at the Beijing Hui Nationality College were unwilling to wear their school badges on the street before 1953 due to a sense of ethnic inferiority; later, this school achieved many successes in sports, and the newspapers publicized them, and the students naturally took out their school badges.

    来北京的民族工作干部座谈
    反对大汉族主义倾向
    编者按　最近，本报编辑部邀请来京开会的各地民族工作干部，以“如何克服大汉族主义倾向”为题，举行了一次座谈会。现在，我们把座谈会的纪录按问题整理出来，发表在这里。会上提出的问题，都不是定论，如果有不同意见，可以继续讨论。
    当前国内民族关系上的主要问题
    当前国内民族关系上的主要问题是什么？
    对这个问题，到会同志的认识并不是完全一致的，有人认为，当前民族关系中的主要问题，是各民族间，特别是汉族与各少数民族间存在着的事实上的不平等。理由是：全国绝大部分地区，已经基本上完成社会主义改造，作为民族压迫的阶级基础，已经基本上消除了，并且90％左右的聚居少数民族已经实行了区域自治；但是历史上遗留下来的各民族间在经济和文化等方面的事实上的不平等，却仍然存在，并且不是短时期可以完全消除的。如果汉族不大力帮助各少数民族解决这个问题，就不利于民族团结。因此，今后应该把这个问题提到首要地位。
    也有这样一种意见，认为当前的主要问题，是少数民族的自治权利没有能够充分实现，这正是汉民族与各少数民族之间关系问题的焦点。要想增强民族团结，就必须充分实现各民族自治地方的自治权利。有人认为这种提法不够确切，事实上，这只是历史上遗留下来的政治上的不平等未能完全消除的一个主要表现。
    再一种意见，认为当前民族关系上的主要问题，是各少数民族与汉族间的隔阂，而大汉族主义思想又是当前民族关系中的主要危险。因此，必须坚决反对大汉族主义倾向。地方民族主义倾向虽然也存在，也应当注意防止和克服；但是，这必须在着重克服大汉族主义的基础上去进行。对于这一点，大家是没有异议的。
    大汉族主义在目前的一个重要的表现，是少数民族的自治权利没有充分实现，有些自治机关名多实少，甚至有名无实。其中最突出的是民族自治州的自治权利问题。有些上级国家机关一直没有把自治州同一般的专署严格地区分开来，他们下达通知时，常常不经过自治州，而直接下达到县。自治州的财权、军权、少数民族干部的职权等等问题，都长期没有得到解决。广西省桂西僮族自治州和广东省海南黎族苗族自治州，过去都程度不同地存在着这个问题。另一个重要表现，是少数民族的风俗、习惯和信仰没有受到应有的尊重。比如，一个勘查队，去年在青海省互助土族自治县钻探煤藏量的时候，事先没有征询当地土族人民的意见，毁坏了一个“脑包”，而这个“脑包”，是被当地的土族人民认为“神山”的。海南岛山区的少数民族，一般都是“靠山吃山”的，但是有些地方在封山育林的时候，却没有事先为他们寻找新的生活出路，使他们的生活一度遭受困难。在某些有少数民族散居的地方，由于少数民族人数很少，他们的风俗、习惯不被尊重的现象，也就更加严重。比如内地的汉民，对散居回族人民的风俗习惯就有不够尊重的现象。这些情况，都在一定程度上损害了民族团结，影响了工作。
    大汉族主义思想是不是滋长了
    座谈中大家反映，近两年来，大汉族主义的表现是增多了。但是，这是否表明大汉族主义思想有所滋长呢？却有着不完全相同的看法。有人认为，思想和表现，是不能割裂开来看的，大汉族主义的表现的增多，就是大汉族主义思想有所滋长的直接暴露。也有的同志认为，大汉族主义的表现，可以说是增多了，但是不同意毫无分析地说大汉族主义的思想也有滋长。理由是：社会主义改造使内地的汉族和散居的少数民族之间的接触，越来越频繁了。比如，山东省的回族农民，已经有96％参加了农业社，其中，90％以上的人参加的是民族联合社。在少数民族区进行的大规模的建设，也使得某些聚居的少数民族空前地增多了同汉族之间的接触。如青海省的柴达木盆地，现在约有七万人，其中绝大部分是从内地调去从事建设的汉族人。他们多半不懂得少数民族的风俗习惯，不熟悉民族政策，也就难免发生一些民族间的纠纷和误会。其次，近两年来，大汉族主义的思想倾向在很多地方、很多汉族干部中，一直是在逐步地克服着。这首先表现在民族工作的成绩上。以培养少数民族干部的工作为例，解放初期，全国各少数民族干部共约一万多人，现在已经增加到二十二万多人，如果加上中小学校和乡级等机关中的工作人员，总数已近三十四万人。另一方面，有些工作中的缺点，只要一被发现，就立刻着手纠正。比如，贵州省在农业合作化运动中，有些汉族干部由于不懂得苗族人民的风俗习惯，事先又没有很好地听取少数民族的意见，而让一些苗族人民把“马郎坡”、“养老牛”等都入了农业社。去年，他们在检查民族政策的执行情况中发现这个问题后，现在很多地方已经采取了补救措施。显然，这些事例都不表明大汉族主义的思想有了新的滋长。因此，这些同志认为：事实上，只是在某些地区的某些汉族干部当中大汉族主义思想有了新的滋长。这些汉族干部，往往只是看到了过去工作中的成绩，以为这全是汉族帮助少数民族的结果，产生了骄傲情绪和优越感，在工作中便生搬硬套汉族地区的经验，不认真听取少数民族的意见。过去在民族工作上的缺点，虽然不是全部在这种思想支配下产生的，但这却是缺点和错误的一个重要来源。因此，今后要想克服民族工作中的缺点，还必须从反对大汉族主义思想入手。
    大汉族主义思想的来源
    大汉族主义思想的来源是什么？有些同志说，大汉族主义思想是地主、资产阶级思想的反映。不过，应该区分那些是自觉的，那些是不自觉的。不然，随便扣帽子，就会伤害很多汉族干部的积极性。因为事实上，自觉的大汉族主义，例如对少数民族公开地歧视、压迫，并认为是理所当然的思想，当前是极少极少的；绝大部分都是犯了错误还不自知。但是，不自觉地犯了严重错误，同样应该被看作是大汉族主义的倾向。汉族干部在少数民族地区工作，就应该随时随地充分考虑到少数民族的特点；考虑不周，本身就是一种大汉族主义的表现。有些同志，认为这种提法会给人一种印象：所有的大汉族主义思想的表现，都是地主、资产阶级思想的反映。这种说法是不妥当的，起不到保护汉族干部积极性的作用。他们认为，不如把大汉族主义思想归结为两个来源：一是历史的阶级根源——地主、资产阶级思想；一是认识的根源——主观主义（经验主义和教条主义）。这样既能分清错误的性质和根源，又能保护大多数汉族干部的积极性。
    如何克服大汉族主义倾向
    谈到如何克服大汉族主义的倾向，大家几乎没有任何分歧，只是彼此作了一些补充。
    他们的第一个意见是：今后应该经常进行民族政策执行情况的检查。1953年和1956年4月份开始的全国民族政策执行情况的检查，都曾经对纠正民族工作中的缺点起了很大的作用。但是，中间隔的时间太长了，有些问题没有更早地发现，更及时地予以纠正。
    第二个意见，今后必须加强民族工作的宣传，大家一个总的感觉是，过去对民族工作的宣传太少了；尤其是各民族在历史上，在祖国的各项建设中所起的作用，宣传得就更少了。这对于克服大民族的优越感和少数民族的自卑感，加强各民族间的了解，是很不利的。比如，过去很多报刊杂志，对于我国的游泳健将穆祥雄，就很少提到他是回族。而注意了这方面的宣传的，全收到了良好的效果。例如北京回民学院的一部分学生，在1953年以前，由于民族自卑感，走到街上连校徽都不愿意带；后来，这个学校在体育运动方面取得了很多成绩，报纸上做了宣传，学生们就很自然地把校徽带出来了。
