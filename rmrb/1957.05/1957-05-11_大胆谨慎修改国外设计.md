    Boldly and Cautiously Revise Foreign Designs

    (Our Dispatch) The Chengdu Thermal Power Plant Construction Engineering Office, proceeding from China's actual conditions and adhering to the principle of "less spending, more results," boldly and cautiously revised foreign designs, saving two million yuan in construction investment while still maintaining the project's scale and quality and ensuring timely heat and power supply.

    The design revision work was carried out under the direct leadership of the Ministry of Electric Power Industry's working group. After the working group arrived in Chengdu in early April, the Chengdu Electric Power Bureau organized three technical teams to study the design drawings. The results of the study showed that the foreign designs were advanced and the technology was first-rate; however, for China's current situation, some items in the design seemed to have excessively high standards. The various technical teams boldly put forward revision suggestions targeting these areas. Important suggestions included: reducing one elevator in the main plant building; replacing seamless steel pipes with cast iron pipes for the main plant's downspouts and ash flushing pipes; replacing asbestos with foamed concrete for the thermal pipeline's insulation layer; replacing steel frame structures with concrete structures for the coal conveying trestle; reducing the scale of the repair shop and lowering the mechanization standard of the water intake pump house... and over thirty other items. The Ministry of Electric Power Industry's working group compiled these opinions and convened more than 20 engineering and technical personnel from construction, design, construction, and installation to study them together. The technical personnel of the construction unit put forward their requirements for savings and revision suggestions at the meeting, while the technical personnel of the design, construction, and installation units focused on analyzing the impact of the revision suggestions on project quality and the possibility of technical conditions from their respective work perspectives. After repeated discussions and heated debates, everyone's opinions were finally unified.

    大胆谨慎修改国外设计
    本报讯　成都热电厂建厂工程处从我国的实际情况出发，根据“少花钱，多办事”的原则，大胆而又谨慎地修改国外设计，节约了建设投资二百万元，依然能保持工程的规模和质量，如期供热发电。
    修改设计的工作，是在电力工业部的工作组直接领导下进行的。工作组在4月上旬到达成都后，成都电业局即组织了三个技术小组，分别研究设计图纸。研究结果表明：国外的设计是先进的，技术是头等的；只是对我国目前的情况来说，设计中有部分项目似嫌标准过高。各个技术小组针对这些地方大胆地提出了修改意见。其中重要的有：将主厂房的电梯减少一台；主厂房的落水管和冲灰管原设计用无缝钢管，现改为铸铁管；热力管的绝热层原设计用石棉，现改为泡沫混凝土；输煤栈桥原设计用钢架结构，现改为混凝土结构；缩小修配车间的规模和降低进水泵房的机械化标准……等三十余项。电力工业部工作组把这些意见汇集起来，约集了建设、设计、施工、安装等方面的工程技术人员二十余人共同研究。建设单位的技术人员在会上提出了他们的节约要求和修改意见，设计、施工、安装等单位的技术人员，则从他们各自的工作角度，着重地分析了修改意见对工程质量的影响和技术条件的可能性。经过反复讨论和热烈争辩，最后才把大家的意见一致起来。
