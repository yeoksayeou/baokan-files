    This newspaper reports: Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier He Long watched the friendly match between the Thai Red and Yellow Basketball Team and China's "August 1st" Team at the Beijing Gymnasium on the evening of the 5th. After the match, they met with all the athletes, shook hands with them one by one, and took a picture together.

    Last night's game was the third game for the Thai Red and Yellow Basketball Team since arriving in Beijing. They played more actively than in the previous two games, and their screen passes were very successful, earning warm applause from the audience. However, due to their slower speed, they were unable to prevent the "August 1st" team's courageous fast breaks, and ultimately lost with a score of 45 to 137 (the score at halftime was 19 to 61).

    泰国红黄篮球队昨晚输给“八一”队
    本报讯　周恩来总理、贺龙副总理，5日晚在北京体育馆观看了泰国红黄篮球队与我国“八一”队的友谊比赛，在比赛完毕后，接见了全体运动员，和运动员一一握手，并在一起照了像。
    昨晚的比赛是泰国红黄篮球队来北京后的第三场比赛，打得比前两场活跃得多，掩护传球很成功，博得观众的热烈鼓掌。但终因速度较慢无法阻止“八一”队的勇猛快攻，最后以四十五比一百三十七失败（上半场是十九比六十一）。
