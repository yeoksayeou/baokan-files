Proposed Epitaph for a McCarthyist
    Here lies Senator Joseph McCarthy.
    He was born later than Hitler, but died earlier than Franco.
    He was born in the United States,
    But this United States is not the same as the United States of Lincoln and Jefferson.
    To eliminate democracy, freedom, and communism was his lifelong goal,
    He made outstanding contributions to the "fascistization" of the United States.
    His name has become synonymous with "fascism,"
    The "ism" he founded has become a synonym for reaction, sin, and ignorance.
    He came from a gambling den in Wisconsin,
    Spending his youth beside the roulette wheel;
    Because of his fanatical anti-communism, he was appreciated by the big bosses,
    And he suddenly climbed onto a seat in the Senate.
    More than ten years of his career as a senator proved his extraordinary genius,
    The Congressional Record of the United States Congress is filled with his anecdotes.
    He burned Mark Twain's novels,
    And banned Whitman's poems;
    He silenced Paul Robeson,
    And forbade Chaplin from acting in the United States;
    He imprisoned many American Communist leaders,
    And sent the Rosenbergs to the electric chair.
    He could spot a communist female teacher at a glance,
    Just because she wore a red coat in the park on May 1st.
    He "exposed" that ninety percent of the officials in the U.S. State Department were dangerous elements,
    Even Dulles was suspicious.……………
    He hated the "Reds" to the core,
    But he liked to drink fresh red blood;
    He hated "Negroes" to the core,
    But his heart was darker than the skin of black people.
    He usually liked to tear up the "U.S. Constitution" for fun,
    And loved to use the original manuscript of the "Declaration of Independence" as toilet paper.
    McCarthy died without closing his eyes,
    Because he could only live for forty-nine years,
    While the "communism" he hated most
    Is showing boundless vitality all over the world.

    拟麦卡锡的墓志铭	池北偶
    这里长眠着参议员约瑟夫·麦卡锡。
    他比希特勒晚生，比佛朗哥早死。
    他出生于美国，
    但是这个美国和林肯、杰斐逊的美国不一码事。
    消灭民主、自由和共产党是他的终生目标，
    对于“法西斯主义”在美国发扬，他有卓著功绩。
    他的名字已经与“法西斯”同义，
    他创立的“主义”成为反动、罪恶、愚昧的代名词。 
    他出身于威斯康星州的一个赌窟，
    在轮盘的旁边渡过年轻的日子；
    由于他反共的狂热得到大老板的赏识，
    一下子就爬上参议院里的交椅。
    十多年的议员生涯证实了他非凡的天才，
    美国国会的议事录记满了他的轶事。
    他烧过马克·吐温的小说，
    查禁过惠特曼的诗；
    他封闭过保罗·罗伯逊的嘴巴，
    不准卓别林在美国演戏；
    他把许多美国共产党领袖关进监狱，
    把罗森堡夫妇送上了电椅。
    他能够一眼识破一个女教员是共产党，
    只凭她5月1日在公园披着一件红色的外衣。
    他“揭穿”过美国国务院中的官员百分之九十是危险分子，
    连杜勒斯也形迹可疑。……………
    他恨透了“红党”，
    但却嗜好喝鲜红的血液；
    他恨透了“黑鬼”，
    但他的心比黑人的皮肤还要黑。
    他日常喜欢拿“美国宪法”撕着取乐，
    爱用“独立宣言”的原稿当手纸。
    麦卡锡断气的时候没有瞑目，
    因为他只能活四十九个年头，
    而他所最痛恶的“共产主义”
    却正在全世界呈现无限生机。
