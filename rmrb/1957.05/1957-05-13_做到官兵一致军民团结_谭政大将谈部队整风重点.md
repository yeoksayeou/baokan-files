Xinhua News Agency, 12th: General Tan Zheng, Director of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, received all the representatives of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers "May Day" observation delegation this morning and gave a report on correctly handling contradictions among the people and the issue of rectification in the army.

General Tan Zheng said that a rectification movement will soon be launched universally throughout the army. The main purpose of the rectification is to oppose bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism, using the method of gentle breeze and mild rain, and resolving internal contradictions within the army through criticism and self-criticism.

General Tan Zheng pointed out that the internal contradictions in the army are mainly in two aspects: the relationship between officers and soldiers, and the relationship between the military and the people. Regarding the relationship between officers and soldiers, judging from the democratic inspections carried out from last winter to this spring, most units have maintained the fine tradition of unity between officers and soldiers, and the relationship is good. In a small number of units, the relationship between officers and soldiers is not good, and in some units, it is neither good nor bad. Many of the problems that have occurred in those units that are not good are caused by shortcomings in leadership. In leadership work, some of our cadres are not good at using persuasion and education methods to manage the troops and often adopt simple and crude methods to deal with ideological problems. Some cadres have also been infected with Kuomintang styles, disguised physical punishment of soldiers and insulted the personality of soldiers. Some companies take a discriminatory and打击attitude towards backward soldiers, using methods for resolving contradictions between ourselves and the enemy to resolve contradictions among the people. This is all wrong.

General Tan Zheng said that the relationship between the army and the people is generally good. However, there are also some contradictions. For example, in military training, some troops only emphasize military needs and do not take care of the production of farmers, and arbitrarily trample on seedlings during exercises; some troops live in civilian houses for a long time, do not take good care of the houses, and do not take care of the difficulties of the landlords; and some troops have too many officers looking for partners in one place, which also causes dissatisfaction among the people. It is recommended that officers pay attention to the following three points when dating: do not look for partners in schools; do not use money or material things as a means of dating; and do not break up other people's marriages. Married officers should educate their wives to participate in labor and maintain a thrifty style in life.

General Tan Zheng said that there are, of course, many other internal contradictions in our army, such as between superiors and subordinates, between workers and peasants and intellectuals, between party members and non-party members, and between individuals and collectives. He hoped that after returning to their units, everyone would offer more opinions to the leadership during the rectification, turning all negative factors into positive ones, and turning positive ones into even more positive ones.

    做到官兵一致军民团结
    谭政大将谈部队整风重点
    新华社12日讯　中国人民解放军总政治部主任谭政大将，今天上午接见了中国人民解放军和中国人民志愿军“五一”节观礼代表团全体代表，并且作了关于正确处理人民内部矛盾和军队整风问题的报告。
    谭政大将说，全军就要普遍展开整风运动了。整风主要是反对官僚主义、宗派主义、主观主义，采用和风细雨的办法，经过批评和自我批评，解决军队内部矛盾。
    谭政大将指出，军队内部矛盾基本是两个方面：官兵之间和军民之间的问题。关于官兵之间的问题，从去冬今春民主检查的情况来看，从根本上说，多数部队保持了官兵一致的优良传统，关系是好的。少数部队官兵关系不好，部分单位不好不坏。那些不好的单位所发生的一些问题，许多是由于领导上的缺点造成的。在领导工作中，我们有些干部还不善于采用说服教育的办法管理部队，对待思想问题，常常采取了简单、生硬的办法。一部分干部还沾染了国民党作风，变相地体罚战士和侮辱战士的人格。有些连队对落后的战士采取歧视、打击的态度，用解决敌我矛盾的办法解决人民内部矛盾。这都是不对的。
    谭政大将说，军队和人民的关系，总的方面是好的。但是也有些矛盾。如军事训练中，有些部队只强调军事需要，不照顾农民的生产，演习时随意踏青苗；有些部队长期住民房，对房屋爱护不够，对房东的困难照顾不够；还有些部队军官们在一个地方找对象过多，也引起人民不满。建议军官在谈恋爱时，应注意遵守以下三点，即不在学校找对象；不用金钱、物质作为进行恋爱的手段；不破坏别人的婚约。结了婚的军官，要教育自己的妻子参加劳动，并在生活上保持俭朴作风。
    谭政大将说，我们部队内部矛盾，当然其它还有很多，如上下级之间，工农分子和知识分子之间，党和非党，个人和集体之间等等。他希望大家回到部队后，在整风中多多对领导上提意见，把一切消极因素变为积极的，积极的变为更加积极。
