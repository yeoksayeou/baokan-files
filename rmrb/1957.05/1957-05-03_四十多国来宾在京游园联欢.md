    四十多国来宾在京游园联欢
    据新华社2日讯  北京市市长彭真为招待来我国参加庆祝五一国际劳动节观礼的外宾，今天在中山公园举行了盛大的游园会。
    这个古代皇帝祭祀的地方，今天成了来自五大洲四十多个国家的客人们欢聚的场所。
    游园会在九时开始。彭真市长在游园开始时向来自四十多个国家的客人表示欢迎和感谢。他说，今天在座的客人，虽然有不同的政治信仰、宗教信仰，但是我们都有发展各国人民友谊和维护和平的愿望。最后他高呼世界和平万岁。
    彭真讲话以后，公园里立刻乐声四起。
    二十多个专业文艺团体在公园内八个地方为客人们表演音乐、舞蹈、杂技、京戏、皮影戏、木偶戏。戏剧家田汉陪着几位日本戏剧家到西北树林看皮影戏，可巧又碰上了瑞典的舞蹈评论家，他们一起观赏了一出“盗仙草”，客人们热烈鼓掌祝贺皮影艺人的精彩演出。
    在习礼亭旁演出的木偶戏，吸引了愈来愈多的客人。比利时的三位经济学家还特意到后台向剧团团长致谢。泰国艺术团的团员和法国工会代表团的代表都同游园的群众一起跳舞。保加利亚军事代表团第一副团长布奇瓦洛夫中将加入了舞圈，他一面笑着一面和一个中国女学生跳邀请舞。
    在西树林里，一群大学生邀请印度尼西亚工会代表们一起跳舞。他们未跳舞就亲热地交谈起来了。
    彭真市长在中山堂和许多游园的客人们进行了亲切的交谈。希腊工会民主阵线总书记西莫斯·哈基狄米特里欧送给彭真市长一只酒壶，希腊工会代表们还带来了雅典市长的一封信，彭真市长请希腊工会代表问候雅典市长。泰国十六工会组织代表团团长乃巴实·堪本集说：“我们带来了泰国工人阶级和人民对中国工人阶级和人民的深切怀念。”彭真市长说，“请你们把中国工人阶级和人民的友谊带回去。”
    游园会一直进行到深夜。
