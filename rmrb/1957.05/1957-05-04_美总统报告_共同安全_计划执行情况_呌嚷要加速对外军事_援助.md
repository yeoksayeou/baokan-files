Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: US President Eisenhower submitted a report to Congress on April 30th regarding the implementation of the "Mutual Security Program" for the second half of 1956, emphasizing that the United States should accelerate military "aid" to its "allies."

The report stated that the US Congress allocated $3.8 billion for the "Mutual Security Program" for the 1957 fiscal year, starting in July of last year. The US government plans to use $2 billion for direct military "aid" and $1.75 billion for indirect military "aid." The report said that in the second half of 1956, the United States had already provided $570 million worth of military supplies to other countries, more than half of which were aircraft and related equipment, nearly one-third were weapons and ammunition for ground forces, and the remainder were naval supplies.

40% of these military supplies were shipped to Europe, and 33% were shipped to the Far East.

In total, the United States has provided nearly $14.8 billion in military "aid" to other countries since it began implementing the "Mutual Security Program" in 1950.

The report stated that the majority of the "aid" provided by the United States in the Far East region is given to South Korea, South Vietnam, Taiwan, and countries participating in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. In the second half of 1956, approximately two-thirds (approximately $420 million) of all so-called "defense support" indirect military "aid" appropriations were given to South Korea, South Vietnam, and Taiwan.

When discussing "economic aid," the report stated that approximately 75% of the new non-military programs will be implemented in some newly developed countries in Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. These countries include Indonesia, Burma, India, Laos, etc.

On the same day, the US International Cooperation Administration announced that the United States had signed loan agreements with Ceylon and Libya, providing each country with a loan of $2.5 million.

US Ambassador to Indonesia, Allison, announced on May 1st that the US International Cooperation Administration had loaned $15 million to Indonesia.

    美总统报告“共同安全”计划执行情况
    呌嚷要加速对外军事“援助”
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：美国总统艾森豪威尔4月30日向国会提出了1956年下半年的“共同安全计划”的执行情况报告，强调美国要加速向它的“盟国”进行军事“援助”。
    报告说，美国国会在从去年7月开始的1957财政年度里拨出三十八亿美元作为“共同安全计划”之用。美国政府计划以二十亿美元作为直接的军事“援助”，以十七亿五千万美元作为间接的军事“援助”。报告说，在1956年下半年，美国已经向其他国家提供了五亿七千万美元的军用品，其中一半以上是飞机和有关设备，差不多三分之一是地面部队的武器弹药，其余部分是海军用品。
    这些军事物资运给欧洲的占40％，运给远东的占33％。
    总计美国自1950年开始执行“共同安全计划”以来已经向其他国家提供了几乎达一百四十八亿美元的军事“援助”。
    报告说，美国在远东地区进行的“援助”大部分是给予南朝鲜、南越、台湾和参加东南亚条约组织的国家的。在1956年下半年，在全部所谓“防御支持”的间接军事“援助”拨款中，就有约三分之二（约四亿二千万美元）是给予南朝鲜、南越和台湾的。
    在谈到“经济援助”的时候，报告说，在新的非军事计划中，大约有75％将在亚洲、中东和非洲的一些新近发展的国家实施。这些国家包括印度尼西亚、缅甸、印度、老挝等。
    同一天，美国国际合作署宣布美国已经分别同锡兰和利比亚签订了贷款协定，给这两个国家各二百五十万美元贷款。
    美国驻印度尼西亚大使艾利逊在5月1日宣布，美国国际合作署已经贷款一千五百万美元给印度尼西亚。
