Comprehensive report from our newspaper: The Middle East News Agency, citing numerous prominent figures recently traveling from Amman to Beirut, reported on the 6th that Jordanian authorities intend to dissolve Parliament and request Deputy Prime Minister Rifai to form a new cabinet to replace the current Ibrahim Hashem cabinet. The Middle East News Agency also said that these people also stated that general elections will not be held, the constitution will be suspended, and the country will be governed under martial law. Other sources believe that the current cabinet will be reorganized to include members trusted by the royal court and imperialists.

At the same time, the Middle East News Agency reported from Damascus on the 6th that the curfew in Jordan has been extended by two hours, starting from 9:00 PM to 6:00 AM the next morning. The Middle East News Agency continued, citing Amman sources, that Jordanian public security authorities are continuing to conduct large-scale arrests of nationalists. To date, approximately 3,000 citizens have been arrested, including many refugees from Amman's Al-Hussein camp.

Jordanian King Hussein has reassigned all but four members of his palace staff to other positions.

Reports indicate that these staff members were reassigned because the King believes they are all members of the Arab Ba'ath Socialist Party. Among those retained is Court Chief Talhouni. Furthermore, Agence France-Presse reported from Beirut on the 7th that Hussein has taken a series of drastic measures to restrict the activities of Egyptian expatriates in Jordan. These measures include the closure of the Coptic College in Amman, as well as the confiscation and burning of newspapers, books, and periodicals sent from Egypt. The Coptic College in Amman is directly under the jurisdiction of the Egyptian Ministry of Education, and Jordanian authorities accuse the college's teachers of inciting students to participate in political demonstrations. These teachers will be deported to Egypt.

Hussein's actions do not seem to have reassured Western countries, and their newspapers are concerned about whether pro-Western forces in Jordan can maintain control of the situation in the long term. New York's "Daily Mirror" pointed out on the 5th that Jordanian King Hussein "appears to have taken control of the situation," but "the forces at work in the Middle East and the undercurrents of hatred are too strong, and are only temporarily subdued." The United States has given Jordan "unlimited assistance," but whether Hussein can "successfully lead Jordan on the right path, only the future will tell."

The Associated Press, in a commentary from Beirut, believes that although Hussein has achieved a "sensational victory," he has not gained "greater prestige" as a result. In the eyes of many Arabs, Hussein should be "condemned for American interference in Jordan's internal affairs."

According to Damascus sources, Jordan has effectively accepted the Eisenhower Doctrine. However, fearing domestic opposition, Jordanian authorities may not publicly announce this at present. Neutral diplomats in Damascus said: "Some nationalist leaders who have fled to neighboring countries have obtained a wire recording of secret negotiations between Hussein and the US Ambassador to Jordan, as well as Court Chief Talhouni, regarding Jordan's acceptance of the Eisenhower Doctrine. The recording shows that the United States is prepared to support Hussein in the event of a rebellion in Jordan and provide Jordan with sufficient financial assistance."

### 约旦当局准备再向右倾  打算解散议会组织更亲西方内阁

    约旦当局准备再向右倾
    打算解散议会组织更亲西方内阁
    本报综合报道　据中东通讯社6日援引许多最近从安曼到贝鲁特的著名人物的话说，约旦当局打算解散议会，并且要求副首相里法伊组织新内阁以代替现在的易卜拉欣·哈希姆内阁。中东通讯社又说，这些人还说，大选将不举行，宪法将停止生效，而国家将根据戒严令来统治。另外有一些人士认为，现任内阁将改组以吸收为宫廷和帝国主义分子所信任的成员参加。
    同时，中东通讯社6日从大马士革报道，约旦的宵禁已经延长两小时，从晚上九点开始到第二天早上6点。中东通讯社接着说，据安曼消息，约旦公安当局继续进行大规模逮捕民族主义者，到现在为止，已有三千左右的公民被捕，其中包括安曼的艾尔·侯赛因营的许多难民。
    约旦国王侯赛因已经把宫廷中的工作人员除了四名以外全部调任他职。
    消息说，把这些工作人员调职是因为国王认为他们都是阿拉伯复兴社会党的党员。在留任的人员中包括宫廷总管塔尔霍尼在内。另据法新社贝鲁特7日消息说，侯赛因已经采取了一系列的剧烈措施，来限制约旦境内埃及侨民的活动。这些措施中包括关闭安曼的哥普特学院，以及没收和烧毁从埃及送去的报纸、书籍和期刊等。安曼的哥普特学院是直接受埃及教育部管辖的，约旦当局指责这个学院的教员怂恿学生们参加政治示威，这些教员将被驱逐到埃及去。
    侯赛因这些行动，似乎还不能使西方国家安心，它们的报刊担心约旦亲西方势力能否长期控制住局势。纽约的“每日镜报”5日指出，约旦国王侯赛因“似乎已经控制住了局势”，但是“在中东起作用的力量和仇恨的潜流过于强大，目前只不过是暂时没有抬头而已”。美国已经给与约旦“一种不可限量的帮助”，然而侯赛因是否能够“成功地领导约旦向正确的道路前进，只有将来才能知道”。
    美联社从贝鲁特发出的评论认为，侯赛因虽然获得“哄动一时的胜利”，但是并未因此获得“更高的声望”。在许多阿拉伯人看来，侯赛因应该为“美国对约旦内政的干涉而受到谴责”。
    另据大马士革消息说，约旦实际上已经接受了艾森豪威尔主义。在目前因为害怕国内反对，约旦当局可能不会公开宣布这件事。大马士革中立的外交人士说：“一些逃至邻国的民族主义领袖已经获得了侯赛因和美国驻约旦大使以及宫庭总管塔尔霍尼之间关于约旦接受艾森豪威尔主义的秘密谈判的钢丝录音。录音表明，美国准备在一旦约旦国内发生叛乱时支持侯赛因，并给约旦足够的财政援助”。
