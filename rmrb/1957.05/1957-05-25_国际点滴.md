　　Casey was originally a good student, and recently had been practicing shooting in a group sponsored by the New York Police Department. It is said that this group is specifically training some young children to act as police assistants to deal with juvenile delinquents.

　　Espionage Rampant in British Universities

　　Labour Party member of the British House of Lords, Lord Chorley, revealed the situation of espionage activities in British universities on May 22nd in the House of Lords. He accused security officials of frequently going to universities in recent years to ask teachers to report on students. Chorley said that many of his acquaintances at the University of London had told him that they had been advised not only to monitor students, but also to monitor their colleagues. This aroused dissatisfaction among university teachers. (Xinhua News Agency)
