Party and Mass Cadres Should Not Receive Awards

The current reward system implemented in some enterprises is quite chaotic, with many unreasonable aspects. This isn't surprising, as our experience and knowledge in managing enterprises are still insufficient. However, it's regrettable that some comrades, despite knowing the rewards are unreasonable, accept the bonuses with peace of mind. Some believe they are entitled to a share anyway, and not only do they fail to actively suggest improvements to the unreasonable rewards, but they even find many reasons to defend them when others raise concerns.

For example, some enterprises simultaneously implement several types of awards, such as plan completion awards, competition awards, as well as savings awards, quality awards, safety awards, and so on. On the surface, the purposes of these bonuses seem different, but in reality, they often overlap and are wasteful. As a result, some comrades receive bonuses that often exceed their wages, even by several times. This is obviously abnormal and unreasonable. However, since the factory has this regulation, these comrades feel they have no reason to refuse and enjoy the benefits complacently.

In the view of some comrades, it seems that not rewarding Party and mass cadres means not implementing the principle of "to each according to their work" for them. This opinion is clearly untenable. In our country, the principle of "to each according to their work" is mainly reflected in wages. While rewards are also part of wages, their greater significance lies in encouraging advanced individuals. We must not think that without rewards, there is no "to each according to their work." Perhaps some will retort: the nature of government organs and enterprises is different, and they cannot be compared. In fact, the state's wage policy has already taken into account the characteristics of enterprises, stipulating that the wages of enterprise cadres are slightly higher than those of government organ cadres. If we further emphasize their special status, it may not be beneficial to strengthening the work of government organs and promoting unity between cadres in state organs and enterprise Party and mass cadres.

Another point these comrades emphasize is that completing tasks in enterprises is not solely the result of the efforts of direct production workers; non-production personnel also put in effort. This principle is generally correct, because people's thoughts dominate all their actions, and without good ideological work, no work can achieve results. However, we cannot draw such a conclusion absolutely. Because real life is complex, we often see situations where some enterprises complete their plans well for a time, but Party and mass work does not necessarily improve. Conversely, some enterprises do a good job in Party and mass work, but may not always be able to complete their tasks. This contradictory phenomenon shows that the effectiveness of ideological work is often not as quick as that of workers' production, where products can be seen even after a minute or two. Ideological work is long-term and arduous; the work done here and now may not take effect until there and then. It is not very beneficial to work to simply believe that good Party and mass work is done when an enterprise has completed it's task.

However, it must be said that even if Party and mass work plays a significant role in completing production tasks at the time, there is nothing to feel wronged about not receiving awards. Because, on the one hand, Party and mass cadres are the organizers and educators of the masses, and the demands on them should be higher than those on the masses; they cannot lower themselves to the level of the average masses. On the other hand, Party and mass work is about working with people, educating the masses, and improving the masses. This is the Party's basic requirement for our work, and we should do it conscientiously, even without rewards. Of course, this does not mean that we do not care about the quality of Party and mass cadres' work. Party and mass cadres should also be frequently encouraged and rewarded, but their rewards should be based on the quality of their specific work, rather than simply determined by the completion of the plan.

The third point these comrades emphasize is that Party and mass cadres are generally promoted from among the workers. If they do not receive awards, no one will be willing to become full-time cadres, which will make it difficult to promote worker cadres. Regarding this point, I would just like to tell a story: In the Soviet Union, a factory's chief engineer was elected as the chairman of the trade union, and his salary was greatly reduced. A Chinese comrade asked him, "After you were elected as the chairman of the trade union, your salary was reduced so much, do you have any complaints?" The engineer said, "I feel honored, because everyone trusts me and elected me as the chairman of the trade union." This chief engineer is worth learning from. Enterprise Party and mass cadres are generally elected by the masses. Being trusted by the masses is an unparalleled honor. If one does not cherish this honor and is concerned with material interests, the masses understand. Not to mention that he is unwilling to be a full-time cadre, even if he is willing, the masses will not want him to be.

From what has been said above, it seems that there is nothing unreasonable about Party and mass cadres not receiving completion plan awards. On the contrary, I think there are at least the following two benefits:

First, it can strengthen the supervisory role of Party and mass organizations over enterprises. As some comrades have said, the quality of enterprise work largely depends on the extent of the political work of Party and mass organizations. One of the important tasks in this is how to exert the supervisory role of Party and mass organizations. However, it is a pity that the supervision of enterprise production work by some enterprise Party and mass organizations in the past has not been satisfactory, and some have even colluded with administrative departments to engage in corruption and fraud to obtain bonuses. It cannot be denied that this is related to Party and mass cadres receiving completion plan awards.

Second, it can strengthen the connection between Party and mass organizations and the masses. The actions of Party and mass cadres can directly affect the masses. Therefore, the conscientious and diligent work and simple living of Party and mass cadres sets a living example for the masses. This not only makes it easier for them to approach and connect with the masses, but also makes it easier for them to persuade and educate the masses.

    党群干部不可得奖
    目前有些企业里实行的奖励比较乱，有不少不合理的地方，这是不奇怪的，因为我们管理企业的经验和知识还不足。但是，遗憾得很，我们有些同志明明知道奖励不合理，拿了奖金却心安理得；有的认为横竖有自己的一份，对不合理的奖励不但不主动提出改进意见，甚至人家提出了意见的时候，自己还找出许多理由来辩护。
    如有的企业同时实行好几种奖，有完成计划奖、竞赛奖，又有节约奖、质量奖、安全奖，等等，表面看起来，这些奖金的目的都不一样，但实际上却往往重复浪费，有些同志因此得到的奖金往往超过工资，甚至超过几倍。这显然是不正常，不合理的。但是，既然是厂里有这个规定，这些同志也就无可非议，怡然自得了。
    在某些同志看来，好像党群干部不得奖，对这些人来说就没有贯彻“按劳取酬”的原则。这个意见显然是站不住脚的。在我们的国家里，贯彻“按劳取酬”的原则主要表现在工资上，奖励虽然也是工资的一部分，但是更多的意义是鼓励先进。我们决不能认为没有奖励就没有“按劳取酬”。或许有人会反驳：机关和企业的性质不一样，不能比。实际上，国家的工资政策上已经注意到了企业的特点，规定企业干部的工资稍高于机关干部的工资。如果再强调其特殊，这对加强机关工作，搞好国家机关干部和企业党群干部的团结，不一定有好处。
    这些同志另外强调的一点是：企业里完成了任务，不仅仅是直接生产工人的力量，非生产人员也花了力量。这个道理，从一般原则上说是正确的；因为人的思想是主宰人的一切行动的，思想工作没有做好，任何工作是不可能取得成绩的。但是不能绝对地得出这样的结论。因为实际生活是复杂的，我们往往可以看到这样的情况：有些企业一时计划完成得好，但党群工作并不一定做得有起色，相反地，有些企业的党群工作做得很有成绩，有时也不一定能完成任务。这种矛盾的现象说明思想工作的见效，往往不像工人生产那样快，甚至在一两分钟后就可以看到产品。思想工作是长期的艰巨的，说不定此时此地做的工作，要到彼时彼地才生效。如果仅仅认为企业完成任务好，党群工作就做好了，这种乐观情绪对工作并不十分有利。
    话还得说回来，即算是党群工作对当时完成生产任务有重大的作用，不得奖也没有什么可委曲的。因为，一方面，党群干部是群众的组织者、教育者，对他们的要求就应该比群众高，不能把自己降低到一般群众的水平；另方面，党群工作就是做人的工作，教育群众，提高群众，这是党对我们工作的基本要求，不奖励，也应该兢兢业业把它做好。当然这并不是说对党群干部工作的好坏不关心了。党群干部也应该经常得到鼓励和奖励，不过他们的奖励，应该根据他们具体工作的好坏来决定，而不应该单纯由完成计划的情况来决定。
    这些同志强调的第三点是：党群干部一般都是从工人中提拔的，如果不得奖，谁都不愿意当脱产干部，这对提拔工人干部有困难。对这一点，我只想讲一个故事：苏联有一个工厂的总工程师当选为工会主席，工资降低了很多。我们中国有位同志问他：“你当选工会主席后，工资降低了这么多，有意见吗？”这位工程师说：“我感觉光荣，因为大家信任我，选我当工会主席。”这位总工程师是值得我们学习的。企业党群干部一般都是群众选举出来的。为群众所信任，这是无尚的光荣。如果自己不珍惜这个光荣，而斤斤计较物质利益，群众是明白的，莫说他不愿意当脱产干部，即使他愿意当，群众也不会要他当。
    从上面所说的这些看来，党群干部不得完成计划奖，并没有什么不合理，相反，我觉得至少有以下两点好处：
    第一，可以加强党群组织对企业的监督作用。正如某些同志所说的，企业工作的好坏，很大程度上决定党群组织政治工作的程度，这中间重要工作之一就是如何发挥党群组织的监督作用。然而可惜的是：我们过去某些企业党群组织对企业生产工作的监督做得并不能令人满意，甚至有的和行政串通舞弊，骗取奖金。这总不能否认同党群干部得完成计划奖是无关的。
    第二，可以加强党群组织和群众的联系。党群干部的一举一动都能直接影响群众，因此，党群干部兢兢业业的工作，艰苦朴素，就是为群众树立一个活的榜样，这不但便于自己接近群众、联系群众，也便于自己说服群众、教育群众。　　　力争
