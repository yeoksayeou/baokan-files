Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, May 17th: Former French Prime Minister Edgar Faure said upon arriving here on the 16th that he supports France recognizing China. He was passing through here on his way to China for a private visit at the invitation of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs.

When reporters asked him to explain the purpose of his trip, he said that he believes "statesmen who manage national affairs must themselves be interested in world affairs, and must spend some time living in various different countries."

He continued, "Since I am primarily an economist, I am particularly interested in the economic aspects of the Chinese experience."

When reporters asked him if he would discuss trade issues with China, Faure said that he had no such mission, but expected to have "private talks with certain individuals." He then said that although the government knew about his trip, it was "a private visit."

Regarding the issue of nuclear explosions, Faure said that he supported stopping "military atomic bomb tests." He supported disarmament and effective supervision of nuclear weapons.

He said that Eisenhower's doctrine regarding the Middle East "was motivated by a desire to seek peace in the region." He added, "However, only time will tell how this doctrine will work."

When reporters asked about the embargo issue and the Algerian issue, he made no comment.

Faure, accompanied by his wife, will stay in Hong Kong for several days before going to Beijing.

    法国前总理富尔在香港答记者问
    主张法国承认中国
    新华社香港17日电　法国前总理富尔在16日到达这里时说，他赞成法国承认中国。他是应中国人民外交学会的邀请去中国进行私人访问时途经这里的。
    在记者要求他解释此行目的时，他说，他认为“管理国事的政治家必须自己对世界事务发生兴趣，而且，要在各种不同的国家内过一段生活”。
    他接着说：“由于我主要是一位经济学家，我特别对中国经验的经济方面感到兴趣。”
    在记者问到他是否要同中国讨论贸易问题时，富尔说，他没有这样的使命，但是，预料要同“某些人士进行私人会谈”。他接着说，虽然政府知道他这次旅行，然而，这是“一次私人访问”。
    关于核爆炸问题，富尔说，他赞成停止“军用原子弹试验”。他赞成裁军和有效地监督核武器。
    他说，艾森豪威尔关于中东的主义“动机是希望求得这一地区的和平”。他又说：“但是，这个主义的作用如何，只有时间才能证明。”
    在记者问到禁运问题和阿尔及利亚问题时，他没有发表意见。
    富尔在他的夫人陪同下，将在香港停留数天，然后去北京。
