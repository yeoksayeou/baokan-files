Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 3rd. Corresponding Academician of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Obruchev, recently discussed the question of whether the mysterious humanoid creature, the "Yeti," exists in the rocks and snow of the Himalayas, with a reporter from the "Moscow Evening News." He said that, in general, based on fairly reliable accounts from local residents and footprints in the snow, it can be inferred that a humanoid creature, more closely related to humans than gorillas and chimpanzees, but more primitive than the most primitive people of the Stone Age, apparently inhabits the Himalayas at altitudes of four thousand to five thousand five hundred meters. Of course, to know the true face of these animals and their stage of development, it would only be possible if one of these mysterious creatures was captured.

Obruchev is presiding over the translation of a British expedition report published in 1954 and records on the search for the "Yeti." These two books will be published in Moscow. The question of whether the "Yeti" exists has long attracted the attention of many countries. Not long ago, the Leningrad House of Scientists also organized a discussion on this issue.

Obruchev said: Local residents have talked to European travelers about the "Yeti" of the Himalayas a long time ago. At the end of the last century, a British expedition provided the first relatively accurate materials on traces of this creature. In the subsequent sixty years, explorers have found its footprints in the snow more than once. Travelers measured the size of these footprints and took photos, but European travelers only saw the "Yeti" once, in 1925, and from a very far distance.

From January to May 1954, a specialized British expedition went to the Himalayas again to search for the "Yeti." The expedition consisted of four zoologists and one anthropologist. They found human footprints in the snow more than once. Sometimes they even found fresh footprints, and the investigators tried to follow the footprints to find the unknown mysterious animal. But without success.

However, these footprints also provided some possibilities for studying the habits of these animals and determining where they live. By questioning local residents, members of the British expedition collected many new and reliable testimonies about encounters with the "Yeti."

Aside from all the fictional elements in the story of the "Yeti," the following conclusions can be drawn: this animal mostly walks on its feet, sometimes (for example, when jumping over cracks in glaciers) it also uses all four limbs. The different sizes of the footprints are obviously due to the different body sizes of males, females, and young. The "Yeti" often walk alone or in groups, but no more than four "Yeti" are together.

From some reports, it is likely that the explorers encountered bears, but some are undoubtedly humanoid "Yeti." According to records, his height is like a teenager or even an adult; except for the face, the whole body is covered with brown or gray hair; he lives on the upper edge of the forest and between the perennial snow, where the footprints of the "Yeti" can be seen most clearly; they eat the roots of plants, grass, wild fruits, insects, and small mammals. The fresh footprints of the "Yeti" are very interesting, with a length from twenty-five centimeters to thirty centimeters. The soles of the feet are much wider than those of humans; the big toe and the second toe are very thick and clearly different from the other toes. This footprint has both human and monkey characteristics, and is very similar to the footprints of Neanderthals (primitive people of the Stone Age) found in a cave in Italy in 1952, but even more primitive than them.

In 1954, the expedition saw two scalps with hair taken from the head of a "Yeti" in a temple in the Himalayas. These two scalps have great scientific value. These are two conical leather hoods about nineteen centimeters high, covered with long, fiery red hair mixed with dark brown. They have been kept there for more than three hundred years. Monks who dress up as "Yeti" during religious ceremonies wear them on their heads.

These two scalps are considered sacred objects, so members of the British expedition were unable to take them away. They could only take a few hairs as specimens. Some scientists believe that these two scalps were actually peeled from the heads of huge humanoid creatures and that the shape of the skull can be determined according to these scalps. Other scientists believe that these scalps were taken from the shoulders of some unknown animal and then made into conical shapes.

Is it possible that similar animals exist within the Soviet Union, for example, in the Pamir high mountain region? This question has aroused great interest. It is undeniable that if this "Yeti" exists, then it is possible for it to migrate northwest from its main distribution area – the Himalayas. The Pamir people's descriptions of seeing hairy wild people are noteworthy, but there is still no definite material to definitively resolve this issue. Explorers and travelers going to the high mountain regions of Soviet Central Asia must pay attention to studying all suspicious footprints they encounter and try to collect reliable materials about the Pamir "wild people."

    雪人之谜
    新华社莫斯科3日电　苏联科学院通讯院士奥勃鲁恰夫最近对“莫斯科晚报”记者谈到喜马拉雅山是否存在岩石和冰天雪地中的神秘类人动物“雪人”的问题。他说，一般说来，根据当地居民相当可靠的叙述和雪上的足迹看来，可以推断，在喜马拉雅山四千公尺到五千五百公尺高度的地方显然居住着一种比大猩猩和黑猩猩更接近人类的类人动物，但是它比石器时代的最原始的人还要原始。当然，要知道这种动物的实在面目和它们的发展程度，只有在捉到一个这种神秘生物的时候才有可能。
    奥勃鲁恰夫正在主持一个英国考察团在1954年发表的考察报告和关于寻找“雪人”的记载的翻译工作。这两本书将在莫斯科出版。关于“雪人”是否存在的问题很久以来就引起了很多国家的注意。不久以前，列宁格勒科学家之家还就这个问题组织了讨论。
    奥勃鲁恰夫说：当地居民很久以前就向欧洲旅行家们谈过喜马拉雅山的“雪人”。上世纪末有一个英国的考察团提供了关于这种生物漂迹的第一批比较确切的材料。此后六十年中，探险家们不止一次在雪上发现它的足迹，旅行者测量了这种足迹的大小并且拍下了照片，但是欧洲的旅行家只看到过一次“雪人”，这是在1925年，而且是在很远的距离之外。
    1954年1月至5月，有一个专门的英国考察团曾再度到喜马拉雅山去寻找“雪人”。这个考察团有四位动物学家和一位人类学家。他们不止一次在雪上发现了人的足迹。有时还发现刚刚走过的足迹，考察者企图按着足迹找到那无人知晓的神秘动物。但是没有成功。
    但是，就是这些足迹也多少提供了研究这种动物的习性和确定他们居住的地方的可能。英国考察团团员用询问当地居民的方法收集了关于碰见“雪人”的许多新的可靠证明。
    撇开关于“雪人”故事中一切虚构的成分，可以得出如下结论：这个动物大部分用脚行走，有时候（例如在跳越冰河上的裂缝的时候）也用四肢，足迹的大小不同显然是由于雌雄和幼仔的身体大小不同而来的。“雪人”常常单独或者成群行走，但是在一起的“雪人”不超过四个。
    从一部分报道看来，探险家们碰上的很可能是熊，但是有一部分却毫无疑问是属于类人的“雪人”。根据记载，他的身材像一个少年或者甚至像一个成人；除了脸部以外，全身长着褐色或灰色的毛；住在森林的上部边缘与经年的积雪之间，这里，“雪人”的足迹可以看得最清楚；他们吃的是植物的根、青草、野果、昆虫和小的哺乳动物。“雪人”的新鲜的足迹很有意思，它的长度从二十五公分到三十公分。脚掌比人要宽得多；大脚趾和第二个脚趾很厚，同其他脚趾显然不同。这个足迹兼有人和猴子的特点，极像1952年在意大利的石穴中发现的内安得塔尔人（石器时代的原始人）的足迹，但是比他们还要原始。
    1954年考察团在喜马拉雅山的一个庙里面看见了两块从“雪人”头上取下来的带发头皮。这两块头皮有很大的科学价值。这是两个大约有十九公分高的圆锥形皮头罩，上面长满了火红色杂着暗褐色的长毛。它们已经在那里保存了三百多年。在举行宗教仪式的时候装扮“雪人”的僧侣就把它们戴在头上。
    这两块头皮被认为是圣物，因此英国考察团团员未能把它带走。只能拿走了几根头发作为标本。有一些科学家认为，这两块头皮是真正从巨大的类人物头上剥下来的，并且可以按照这些头皮来测定头颅的形状。另外一些科学家认为这些头皮是从某种不知名的动物肩上取下来，再把它们做成圆锥形的。
    苏联境内，例如在帕米尔高山地区，是否可能有这类动物？这个问题引起很大的兴趣。不可否认，这种“雪人”如果存在的话，那么从它主要的散布区——喜马拉雅山移到西北方是可能的。帕米尔人关于看见毛蓬蓬的野人的叙述是值得注意的，但是肯定地解决这个问题的确切材料至今还没有。到苏联中亚细亚高山地区去的探险家和旅行家必须注意研究他们所遇见的一切可疑足迹，并且尽力收集有关帕米尔“野人”的确实材料。
