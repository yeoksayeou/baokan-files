Xinhua News Agency, May 22nd: The Third National Congress of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League continued its plenary session on the afternoon of the 22nd. Lu Dingyi, alternate member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, gave a report at today's meeting.

In his report, Lu Dingyi first analyzed the current situation. He pointed out that the socialist revolution has achieved a decisive victory in our country, but because the consolidation of agricultural cooperativization in our country will still take several years, the bourgeoisie will still exist for a period of time, and bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideology will continue to exist seriously for a long time. Our understanding of the laws of socialist construction is still somewhat blind. At the same time, there is still imperialism, so our victory has not been completely consolidated.

Lu Dingyi said that the socialist revolution is the most profound revolution, which will ultimately and forever eliminate the system of exploitation of man by man. This change in the social system will surely be reflected in people's minds and cause changes in their thinking. Our guiding principles and methods for ideological work should be determined according to this situation. Lu Dingyi pointed out that the transformation of bourgeois elements and intellectuals is possible, because many of them are patriotic and can support socialism. To transform them is to make the majority of them support socialism, and over a long period of time, to gradually have more Marxists among the intellectuals than there are now. Lu Dingyi then said that the Communist Party must transform itself and learn to correctly handle contradictions among the people. The method is rectification, allowing non-Party members to express their criticisms freely; it is to oppose bureaucracy, subjectivism, and sectarianism, and to participate in physical labor. In the course of rectification, we must learn to master the laws of socialist construction in a relatively short period of time; learn to unite the majority of people to improve our work and strengthen the leadership of the Party.

Lu Dingyi congratulated the delegates on the Youth League's change of name to the Communist Youth League, and encouraged the Youth League members to be determined to be communists for life. He said that to be a communist, one must serve the people wholeheartedly and serve the people with the Marxist-Leninist viewpoint, position, and method. Lu Dingyi said that the development of socialist society is not smooth sailing. He hoped that the youth will be able to withstand the tests of political and ideological storms, withstand the tests of difficulties, stand firm in the position of communists in the storms, and become new people with complete knowledge who combine mental and physical labor. Finally, Lu Dingyi, as an old member of the Communist Youth League, hoped that the Youth League members would work hard, study Marxism-Leninism and dialectical materialism, conquer scientific fortresses, and continue to participate in the great cause of socialist construction under the leadership of the Party.

In today's speeches and written statements, four delegates criticized the work of the League and the Central Committee of the League. Lu Hengjun, Deputy Secretary of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Youth League, criticized the Central Committee of the League for lacking the spirit of soliciting criticism, and the speeches of various departments did not mention the contradictions in the current work, and some departments lacked the spirit of self-criticism. Zhang Jianwu, Deputy Secretary of the Liu'an Prefectural Committee of the Youth League in Anhui Province, criticized the Central Committee of the League for not listening to the voices from below, not caring enough about and supporting the lower levels, and not being able to help the lower levels solve practical problems in a timely manner. He asked the responsible cadres of the Central Committee of the League to go deep into the grassroots and rural areas, listen to the opinions and demands of the lower levels, and help the lower levels set an example and solve practical problems. Wu Liangpu, Secretary of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Youth League, pointed out in a written statement that the Central Committee of the Youth League and the Provincial Committees of the League rarely convened meetings in the past; collective leadership was unsound; the higher-level leading organs rarely listened humbly to the opinions of the lower levels, cared for the lower-level cadres, and lacked a realistic attitude towards the problems of the lower levels, with too much criticism and accusations. In his written statement, he pointed out that it is necessary to vigorously promote the work style of maintaining close ties with the masses, maintaining close ties with reality, and being down-to-earth. In a joint statement, Zhang Ruilin, Tong Bingheng, Yu Decai, Chen Changzhi, and Xu Rongzheng, delegates from Shaanxi, criticized the Central Committee of the League for lacking specific investigation and research and specific leadership on the work of the League in secondary vocational schools, forming a package of general leadership methods. They demanded that the leadership of the League's work in secondary vocational schools be strengthened.

Yang Haibo, Minister of the Youth Workers Department of the Central Committee of the Youth League, spoke about the need to strengthen the work for new workers and educate new workers to become conscious and skilled laborers. He pointed out that strengthening the work for new workers is also an important aspect of correctly handling contradictions within the working class. Therefore, actively assisting the Party in cultivating the younger generation of the Chinese working class is a regular and important political task of the Youth League organizations at all levels. Yang Haibo said that to strengthen the political and ideological education of new workers, class education and labor education should be the core, so that they can fully understand the glorious revolutionary history of the Chinese working class and the great responsibility in the cause of socialist construction, thereby overcoming non-working-class ideological consciousness. In particular, it is necessary to conduct education on treating labor for them, help them establish a solid concept of labor, and cherish the idea of their own profession; establish a sense of honor and pride in being a worker. Yang Haibo also proposed that it is necessary to help and care for the new workers' studies, educate young workers to learn from the old workers, respect the old workers, and educate the old workers to cherish and care for the new workers like treating their children and brothers. At the same time, the Youth League should also earnestly care about the lives of the new workers, so that they can develop physically and mentally healthily.

    陆定一在青年团代表大会上勉励青年团员
    在风浪里站稳共产主义者立场
    新华社22日讯　中国新民主主义青年团第三次全国代表大会22日下午继续举行全体会议。中共中央政治局候补委员陆定一在今天的大会上作了报告。
    陆定一在他报告中首先分析了目前的形势，他指出社会主义革命已经在我国取得了决定性的胜利，但是由于我国的农业合作化的巩固还需要有几年的时间，资产阶级还将存在一个时期，资产阶级、小资产阶级思想还会长期地严重地存在，我们对社会主义建设的发展规律的认识还带有一定的盲目性，同时，还有帝国主义的存在，因此我们的胜利还没有完全巩固。
    陆定一说，社会主义革命是一次最深刻的革命，它最后地、永远地消灭人对人的剥削制度。这个社会制度上的变革，一定会反映到人们的思想上，引起人们思想上的变化。我们的思想工作的方针和办法，就要根据这样的形势来决定。陆定一指出，资产阶级分子和知识分子的改造是可能的，因为他们中间有很多人是爱国的，是可以赞成社会主义的，对他们进行改造就是要使他们之中大多数人赞成社会主义，并在很长的时间内，使知识分子中间逐渐有比现在更多的人成为马克思主义者。陆定一接着说，共产党要自己改造自己，要学会正确处理人民内部矛盾。方法就是整风，让党外人士畅所欲言地提出批评；就是反对官僚主义、主观主义和宗派主义和参加体力劳动。我们要在整风中间，在比较短的时间内学会掌握社会主义建设的发展规律；学会团结大多数人，来改进我们的工作，加强党的领导。
    陆定一向代表们祝贺团改名为共产主义青年团，勉励青年团员要立志终身作一个共产主义者。他说，作一个共产主义者，就要全心全意地为人民服务，以马克思列宁主义的观点、立场、方法来为人民服务。陆定一说，社会主义社会的发展并不是风平浪静的，他希望青年们要经得起政治上、思想上的风浪的考验，经得起困难的考验，在风浪里站稳共产主义者的立场，要作一个脑力劳动和体力劳动相结合的有完全知识的新人。陆定一最后以一个老共青团员的身份，希望青年团员艰苦地劳动，学习马克思列宁主义和辩证唯物主义，攻破科学堡垒，在党的领导下，继续参加伟大的社会主义建设事业。
    在今天的大会发言和书面发言中，有四位代表对团的工作和团中央提出批评。青年团江苏省委副书记陆亨俊批评团中央缺乏征求批评的精神，各部门的发言也没有谈到当前工作中的矛盾，有些部门缺乏自我批评的精神。青年团安徽省六安地工委副书记张建吾批评了团中央听取下边呼声、关心与支持下面不够，不能及时地帮助下边解决实际问题。他要求团中央负责干部深入基层和农村，倾听下边的意见和要求，帮助下边做出样子和解决实际问题。青年团黑龙江省委书记吴亮璞在书面发言中指出，过去团中央委员会和团的省委员会很少召开；集体领导不健全；上级领导机关很少虚心倾听下面的意见，体贴下级干部，对下边的问题缺少实事求是的态度，批评指责过多。他在书面发言中指出，要大力提倡联系群众、联系实际、踏踏实实的工作作风。陕西代表张瑞霖、佟秉衡、余德才、陈长之、徐荣铮的联合发言中，批评团中央对中等专业学校团的工作，缺乏具体的调查研究和具体的领导，形成一揽子的一般领导方法。他们要求加强对中等专业学校团的工作的领导。
    青年团中央青工部部长杨海波的发言，谈到要加强对新工人的工作，教育新工人成为有觉悟有技术的劳动者。他指出，加强对新工人的工作，也是正确处理工人阶级内部矛盾的一个重要方面。因此，积极地协助党培养好中国工人阶级的年轻一代，是各级青年团组织的一项经常的重要的政治任务。杨海波说，要加强对新工人的政治思想教育，应当以阶级教育和劳动教育为中心，使他们充分了解中国工人阶级光荣的革命历史和在社会主义建设事业中的伟大责任，从而克服非工人阶级的思想意识。特别要向他们进行对待劳动的教育，帮助他们树立巩固的劳动观念，热爱自己的专业的思想；树立起作一个工人的荣誉感和自豪感。杨海波还提出，要帮助和关心新工人的学习，教育青年工人向老工人学习，尊重老工人，教育老工人像对待子女和兄弟那样爱护和关怀新工人。同时，青年团也要切实关心新工人的生活，使他们能够身心健康地发展起来。
