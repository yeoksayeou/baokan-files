Is it Better for Workers' Families to Return Home to Engage in Production?
    Li Guangfa Wang Rongjiang

Currently, farmers everywhere are responding to the Party's call: striving for a bumper harvest in agriculture. However, a portion of the labor potential has not been utilized, and that is the large number of laborers who are blindly flowing into the cities, including the families of workers who are entering the cities. According to statistics from Dongliubao Village, Xiliubao Township, Jiahe County, Hebei Province, due to the large-scale blind influx of labor into the cities, the labor force in 1957 was reduced by half compared to 1956, which greatly affected agricultural production. Some people, as long as someone in their family works in the city, always want to move to the city to escape agricultural labor. Some young women, when dating city workers, make the condition: after marriage, she will no longer participate in agricultural production and must live in the city with her husband. Some people put forward the slogan: "Rather suffer from cold and hunger outside than do farm work at home!" There is a woman named Song Lanying in this village, whose husband works in the Suxian Iron Production Cooperative in Anhui Province, earning a monthly salary of thirty-seven yuan. She left her seventy-year-old father in the countryside and moved to the city. Before leaving, she killed several chickens at home and ate all the wheat. Someone asked her:
    "After you leave, you haven't left anything at home, what will you do with the elderly?"
    "Isn't that easy? Doesn't the commune now have 'Five Guarantees'? The commune will take care of his life!" she replied with a straight face.
    "After going to the city, relying solely on your husband's salary, I'm afraid it won't be enough."
      "It's easy, after getting there, the superiors will take care of it." She replied even more bluntly.
    There is also a female Communist Party member in this village named Wang Huirong, who used to be the deputy director of the agricultural cooperative. Her husband works in an iron factory in Jinan City. Disregarding the villagers' attempts to persuade her to stay, she went to her husband's place last June. After arriving in the city, she used up all of her husband's salary, and later needed help from her third younger brother. It can be seen that the blind migration of workers' families to the city is not beneficial to the lives of workers' families. It is hoped that worker comrades will mobilize their families to return to their hometowns to participate in agricultural production as much as possible. This is beneficial to striving for a bumper harvest in agriculture. Of course, I am not advocating separating couples; I am just saying that we can think of other ways to solve this problem that would be more appropriate. For example, during the agricultural slack season between winter and spring, you can also bring your wife to live with you for a month or two; when the busy farming season comes, let her go back to participate in agricultural production again. Wouldn't this be beneficial to both yourself and the country?

    职工家属还是回家乡生产好
    李广发　王荣江
    现在各地农民都在响应党的号召：为争取农业大丰收而努力。但是，还有一部分劳动潜力没有利用起来，这就是盲目流入城市的大批劳动力，其中也包括进入城市的职工家属。据河北交河县西流堡乡东流堡村的统计，由于劳动力大批盲目流入城市，1957年劳动力比1956年减少了一半，使农业生产受到很大影响。有些人只要家里有人在城市工作，就总想移入城市，以便脱离农业劳动。有些青年妇女在同城市工人谈恋爱的时候，就提出条件：婚后她不能再参加农业生产，一定要跟丈夫住到城里去。有人提出口号：“宁肯在外受冻挨饿，也不在家干庄稼活！”这个村里有个妇女叫宋兰英，她的爱人在安徽省宿县铁业生产合作社工作，每月工资收入三十七元。她把七十来岁的老父亲留在农村，自己搬到城市里去了。临走前她把家里的几只鸡杀了，把小麦也吃光了。有人问她：
    “你走后，家里什么也没留下，撇下这大年纪的老人怎么办？”
    “那还不好办吗？社里现在不是有‘五保’吗？他的生活由社来包呗！”她理直气壮地回答。
    “进城去以后，光靠你丈夫挣的钱，恐怕也不够的呀。”
      “好说，到那里以后，自有上级照顾。”她回答得更干脆。
    这个村里还有女共产党员王会荣，过去曾任农业社副主任。她的丈夫在济南市一个铁工厂工作。她也不顾乡里的人们的挽留，在去年6月到她丈夫那里去了。到城市以后，把丈夫挣的工资用净了，后来还需要她三弟帮助她。可见职工家属盲目迁到城市来住，对于职工家庭的生活也是没有好处的。希望工人同志们动员自己的家属尽可能地回乡参加农业生产。这对于争取农业大丰收是有好处的。当然，我不是提倡把夫妇隔离开；我只是说，可以想些别的办法来解决这个问题，会更妥善些，比方，在冬春之间的农闲季节，也可以把自己的妻子接来住上一两个月；等农忙期间再让她回去参加农业生产，这样对自己对国家不是都有好处吗？
