    Serving a Lifetime
    Jin Shoushen
    In Beijing's service industry, there are many veteran workers who not only serve wholeheartedly but also truly "serve a lifetime." There are too many people in the service industry who have served a lifetime. Today, let's talk about the catering industry—the old waiters in restaurants.
    A restaurant waiter is one of the three major components of a restaurant. That is to say, a restaurant must have a dining area, a cashier, and a kitchen; a restaurant cannot be opened without one of these. The dining area refers to the waiters. The dining area, of course, must have "runners." The runners are also called "salesmen." Generally speaking, these are all titles for catering service personnel. None of these titles is inferior to the word "cadre"! Without the "salesman," can the food be sold? Can the runner be slow and indifferent? Therefore, the word "run" fully praises the past virtues of the waiter. In the past, the dining area was also a separate profession, called "the diligence profession." Adding the word "diligence" to the industry is such a nice term! The old veterans of the diligence profession have two mottoes: "Three diligences eat widely, three drifts are worthless!" These two mottoes have prompted the old waiters to have a sense of responsibility for serving customers wholeheartedly.
    In Beijing's catering industry, there are quite a few waiters who have served for more than 50 years, even more who have served for more than 40 years, and countless who have served for more than 30 years. Why have they served for so many years? Why do they serve so well? First of all, let's talk about their service attitude and service skills. From the time they were apprentices, the masters told them: you must treat the customers as important, regardless of whether they are well-dressed or eat a lot; you must treat them equally and kindly; when a customer comes in, you must "settle" them in a seat; it is a disgrace to the "diligence profession" if a customer comes in and no one pays attention to them, and they leave after looking around; you must be able to "hold" the customer, and not let the customer call here and there… In short, there are too many practical skills that waiters should learn. I asked Gao Wenyu, who has been serving at the Shaboju restaurant for thirty or forty years: "How can you settle and hold the customers?" He said: "First of all, you always have to think that customers come to eat to eat well and comfortably, not to find trouble. What's the point of entering the door and no one paying attention to them, and the waiters all have cold faces and closed mouths! Therefore, when a customer enters the door, the waiter must first greet them and find them a seat. This does not mean that the waiter is 'lowly,' but it is precisely the waiter's responsibility." He also said: "To hold the customer, you must be diligent in three ways: feet, mouth, and eyes. Run around a bit, ask more, and look more. If you see that a table is about to run out of rice, you should ask: Would you like some more rice? If you see that a table has finished eating, you should ask: Do you want anything else? How much is it in total? You can pay at the counter! You can't let the table on the east side call out: Comrade, more rice! The table on the west side calls out: Comrade, check, please!"
    Old waiters can not only serve customers, but also plan for them, making customers feel that the waiter is like a family member. For example, when customers order dishes, sometimes they don't know the size of the portions, and sometimes they order too much. Waiters should not only sell more for the cashier, but it is necessary to remind the customer: "How many of you are eating?" "One person." "One person can't eat all of that!" After the waiter's reminder, maybe the customer will reduce some dishes, and the customer will eat comfortably, and there will be no waste of dishes. Liu Rui, who used to work at "Xilaishun," and Wang Bin, who used to work at "Liangyixuan" (both are now serving at the Grain Store Hui Muslim Restaurant), Liu Rui has been a waiter for nearly 50 years, and Wang Bin has been a waiter for nearly 40 years. They have always been planning for customers. Liu Rui and Wang Bin often say: "We have to make sure that the customers are full, not that they don't have enough to eat, and not that they leave leftovers." I asked: "What if the customers don't have enough to eat?" "If they don't have enough to eat, they can order more! How can a runner be afraid of trouble!"
    Old waiters can not only plan for customers, but also take care of them carefully. There is one thing I can't forget. Of course, it is also about the old waiters. In the past, there was a truly old waiter at Shaboju, named Hong Jixiang. He entered Shaboju at the age of sixteen and worked as a runner for seventy-two years, dying in Shaboju at the age of eighty-eight. I remember one year, it was the hottest noon in summer, and I ran to Shaboju for lunch, running with sweat all over my head. I shouted as soon as I entered the door: "Uncle Hong, please give me a bottle of soda, iced!" "You? Don't drink soda! You're running with such a heat on, if you drink cold soda and then eat boiled pork, aren't you asking for trouble?" Saying that, he handed over a palm-leaf fan, "You fan yourself first, I'll make you a pot of strong tea." More than twenty years have passed, and the enthusiasm of old man Hong seems to be still in front of me.
    If a waiter does a good job, just like a master chef with good cooking skills, he will not be forgotten. Hong Jixiang, mentioned above, is an example. In addition, like old Luan of Tongheguan who died many years ago, like Li Mazi of Tongheju, like old Gao of Duyichu, like Weng Si of Guoqiang Western Restaurant, these old waiters who have served for a lifetime, although many years have passed, and some have even died, when they are mentioned, people can clearly say what advantages someone has.
    There is a saying in Beijing: "Eating in a restaurant depends on the waiter." The importance of the waiter is evident. In fact, opening a restaurant also depends on the waiter's good attitude. The knowledge of a waiter is very profound.

### 服务一辈子

    服务一辈子	金受申
    北京服务行业里面有许多老前辈，他们不但全心全意地服务，而且确实做到了“服务一辈子”。服务行业里做到服务一辈子的人太多了，现在我们单谈一谈饮食业——饭馆的老服务员吧。
    饭馆服务员，是一个饭馆组成的三大成员之一，也就是说一个饭馆必须有堂、柜、灶三方面，缺了一个就开不成饭馆。堂指的就是服务员，堂口嘛，当然要有“跑堂儿的”，跑堂儿的又叫“过卖”，总起来说，就都是饮食业服务员的称号。这些称号，哪一个也不比干部两个字低！过卖，不经过他，菜饭能卖出去吗？跑堂儿的，服务员慢条斯理地、带答不理地像话吗？所以“跑”字是充分地把过去服务员的美德表扬出来了。过去，堂口的也自成一行，叫做“勤行”，行业加个“勤”字，是多么好听的名词！勤行老前辈们，有两句格言：“三勤吃的宽，三飘不值钱！”这两句格言，就促使老服务员们，有了实心实意为顾客服务的责任感。
    北京饮食业中的服务员，服务五十年以上的还不少，四十年以上的更多，三十年以上的简直数不过来了。他们为什么服务了这么多年？为什么服务得这么好？首先要从他们服务态度、服务技术上说，他们从学徒起，师傅就告诉了：必须把座儿（顾客）当个座儿，不要看人穿的好坏、不要看人吃的多少，要一律平等、和蔼地对待；座儿进来，必须“安住”座儿，座儿进来没人搭理，瞧瞧又走出去的，这是“勤行”的耻辱；必须“压得住”座儿，不能让客人这儿也叫，那儿也叫……多了，服务员应该学的实际学问太多了。我问在沙锅居服务了三、四十年的高文玉：“你们怎么就能安住座儿、压得住座儿呢？”他说：“首先心里老想着，客人来吃饭，是为了吃好、吃得舒服，不是找堵心来了，进门没人理，服务员一个个都冷着脸子、闭着嘴，这像什么话！所以，客人进门，服务员必须先打招呼，替客人找好了座位，这不表明服务员‘低下’，这正是服务员的责任。”他又说： “要想压得住座儿，必须三勤：脚勤、嘴勤、眼睛勤，勤跑着点儿，多问问，多瞧瞧，瞧见哪桌米饭快吃光了，就要问一声：给您续点饭哪？瞧儿哪桌已然吃完了，就要问一声：您不找补什么了？一共几角几分，您柜上会吧！不能让东边这桌叫：同志，添饭！西边那桌叫：同志，算账！”。
    老服务员不但能给客人服务，还能替客人打算，让客人觉得这服务员简直像一家人似的，比如：客人要菜，有时候不知道菜码的大小，有时候要的菜太多。服务员不能只为柜上多卖钱，是有必要提醒客人一声的：“您几位吃呀？”“一个人。”“一位吃不了吧！”客人在服务员提醒之下，也许就减下一些菜肴，客人吃的也舒服，也不至于剩下菜肴，白白的浪费。原来在“西来顺”的服务员刘瑞，“两益轩”的服务员王斌（现在都在粮食店回民食堂服务），刘瑞做服务员快五十年了，王斌做服务员快四十年了，他们一贯就是给客人打算的。刘瑞、王斌常说：“我们得让客人吃饱了，不能吃不够，不能吃剩下。”我问：“客人吃不够怎么办？”“不够吃的再找补呀！当跑堂儿的有怕麻烦的！”
    老服务员不但能替客人打算，还能细心地照顾客人。有一件我不能忘的事，在这里说，当然也是关于老服务员的事了。从前，沙锅居有一个可以说是真老的服务员，名字叫洪吉祥，他从十六岁进沙锅居，整整干了七十二年跑堂儿的，八十八岁死在了沙锅居。记得有一年，正是夏天最热的一个中午，我跑到沙锅居吃午饭去了，跑得满头大汗的，进门就喊：“洪大爷，您给来一瓶汽水，要冰镇的！”“你呀？你别喝汽水啦！跑得一心心火，一喝凉汽水，回头再吃白肉，这不是找麻烦吗？”说着，他递过一把蒲葵扇来，“你先扇着，我给你沏壶酽茶去。”二十多年了，洪老头的这种热情，仿佛还在眼前似的。
    服务员工作做好了，也和烹调技术好的大师傅一样，是不会被人忘掉的。上面说的洪吉祥，就是一个例子。此外，像死去多年的同和馆老栾，像同和居的李麻子，像都一处的老高，像国强西餐馆的翁四，这些服务了一辈子的老服务员，虽然隔了多少年，虽然有的还已然死掉，可是一提起来，人们还清清楚楚地说得出某人有某某优点。
    北京有句语汇：“吃饭馆吃过卖”，服务员的重要性可知。实际开饭馆也靠着服务员的态度好，服务员这门学问可深了。
