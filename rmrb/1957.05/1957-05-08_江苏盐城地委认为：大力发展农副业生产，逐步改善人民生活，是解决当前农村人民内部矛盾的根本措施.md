The Yancheng Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Jiangsu Province believes that vigorously developing agricultural and sideline production and gradually improving the people's lives are the fundamental measures to resolve current internal contradictions among the rural people.

    (Reported by this newspaper) From April 16th to 24th, the Yancheng Prefectural Committee of the CPC convened an enlarged meeting attended by county party secretaries and farm party committee secretaries, analyzed the current internal contradictions among the rural people, and proposed specific measures to resolve these contradictions.

    After studying Chairman Mao's speech at the Supreme State Conference and related documents, the comrades present conducted informal talks and discussions in connection with their ideological understanding. Everyone believed that the contradictions are specifically manifested in the following issues: the people's essential daily necessities (such as grain, fuel grass, cooking oil, etc.) still cannot meet the people's demands for improved living standards; a certain distance exists between the state plan and the management independence of agricultural cooperatives; the work level of grassroots cadres is still not adapted to the management requirements of agricultural cooperatives; and many problems in the arrangement of collective sideline occupations and cooperative members' household sideline occupations, as well as in sideline occupations, handicrafts, commerce, and transportation, have not been properly resolved. In addition, many ideological and practical problems exist in worker-peasant relations, urban-rural relations, and students' enrollment and employment. The more serious bureaucratic and subjectivist work styles existing in the leadership organs at all levels have also greatly affected the Party's connection with the people.

    The meeting further discussed specific measures to correctly resolve internal contradictions among the rural people. Everyone believed that vigorously developing agricultural and sideline production and gradually improving people's lives are the fundamental measures to resolve current internal contradictions among the rural people. It is necessary to adopt various methods to ensure the completion of this year's total grain task of 2.3 billion jin for the entire prefecture, and strive to achieve an annual output of 2.6 billion jin of grain within two or three years to achieve self-sufficiency in grain. To complete the grain production task and increase people's income, it is necessary to conscientiously implement the principle of maintaining the management independence of agricultural cooperatives under the guidance of the state plan. It is necessary to continuously improve the management of agricultural cooperatives, implement the policy of running cooperatives democratically, mobilize the production enthusiasm of cooperative members, and consolidate agricultural cooperatives. Some solutions were also put forward for other contradictions. Regarding overcoming bureaucracy, it was proposed that county committees should spend one-third of their time delving into rural areas, schools, and towns to strengthen special investigations; earnestly handle people's letters and visits; regularly convene special meetings on propaganda work to specifically analyze the ideological trends of people from all walks of life; and rural party branches should truly take up the task of ideological education.

    江苏盐城地委认为：大力发展农副业生产，逐步改善人民生活，是解决当前农村人民内部矛盾的根本措施
    本报讯　中共盐城地委于4月16日到24日，召开了有县委书记、农场党委书记参加的扩大会议，分析了当前农村中人民内部的矛盾，并提出了解决矛盾的具体措施。
    到会同志学习了毛主席在最高国务会议上的讲话和有关文件后，联系思想认识进行了漫谈和讨论。大家认为矛盾具体表现在下面一些问题上：人民生活主要必需品（如粮食、烧草、食油等）尚不能满足人民改善生活的要求；国家计划与农业社的经营独立性存在一定的距离；基层干部的工作水平还与农业社的经营管理要求不相适应；在集体副业和社员家庭副业的安排上以及副业与手工业、商业、运输业等方面也都存在不少问题未妥善解决。此外，在工农关系和城乡关系上、学生的升学和就业上，也存在着许多思想问题和实际问题。各级领导机关中存在的较严重的官僚主义、主观主义思想作风，也在很大程度上影响了党和人民群众的联系。
    会议还进一步讨论了正确地解决农村人民内部矛盾的具体措施。大家认为：大力发展农、副业生产，逐步改善人民生活是解决当前农村人民内部矛盾的根本措施，必须采取各种办法保证完成今年全专区二十三亿斤粮食任务，并争取在两三年内年产量达到二十六亿斤粮食，做到粮食自给；为了完成粮食生产任务，增加人民收入，必须认真贯彻在国家计划指导下，保持农业社经营独立性的原则；不断改进农业社的经营管理，贯彻民主办社方针，调动社员生产积极性，巩固农业社。对其他各种矛盾，也提出了一些解决的措施。关于克服官僚主义，提出县委要有三分之一的时间深入农村、学校、城镇，加强专题调查；认真处理人民来信、来访；定期召开宣传工作专门会议，具体分析各阶层人民思想动向；农村党支部要真正抓起思想教育工作。
