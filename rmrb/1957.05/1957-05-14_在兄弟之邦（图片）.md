    In Fraternal Countries
    Starting in May, Czechoslovakia began using a new, exceptionally beautiful gold coin to replace the original paper currency. To select the best design, a competition was held. The judging committee considered 107 different sketches submitted by artists and sculptors. After a rigorous and comprehensive selection process, the design by young female architect Maria Uchytilová-Kučová was finally chosen.
    The top picture shows the author's design, and the bottom picture shows the Czechoslovakian national emblem.
    The Polish "Buszczynski" Seed Company is the largest seed company in Poland, with over seventy years of history. The seeds supplied by this company have won awards at numerous expos and exhibitions held in Poland and abroad. It now specializes in sugar beet seeds.
   The "Buszczynski" Seed Company's output almost meets two-thirds of the national demand for seeds. In addition, the company exports seeds to countries such as Italy, Austria, Yugoslavia, and Hungary.
    Sheep farming plays an important role in Albania's economy. Sheep are a major part of Albania's livestock industry, providing the country with all the wool it needs. Mutton accounts for 40% of all meat consumption and sheep milk production accounts for about 36% of all milk production. Albania's sheep population per capita exceeds that of many countries, averaging 1,224 sheep per thousand people in 1955. In February of this year, the Albanian Labor Party Central Committee drafted a plan to develop and improve sheep farming, stipulating that by 1960, there would be 550,000 head of fine-wool sheep, accounting for 30% of the total sheep population. A series of measures have been and are being taken to accomplish this task. This year, 500 artificial insemination stations will be established, and currently 1,800 cadres are undergoing specialized training.
    This year, the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has invested over 322 million won (Korean currency) in building new commercial networks. These funds will be used to establish many state-owned stores and rural supply and marketing cooperative stores in cities, worker districts, and vast rural areas. The total area of newly built stores will be over 148,700 square meters. In Pyongyang, the area of state-owned stores newly built this year is over 22,000 square meters, eight times the area built last year.
    On April 27, Bulgaria's first iron-smelting blast furnace (see left picture) went into production. It is one of two blast furnaces built at the "Lenin" Metallurgical Plant and can smelt approximately 120,000 tons of pig iron annually. When the second blast furnace is completed, Bulgaria's annual pig iron production will reach 255,000 tons.
