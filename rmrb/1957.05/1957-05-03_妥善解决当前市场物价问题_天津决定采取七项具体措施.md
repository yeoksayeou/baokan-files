Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, May 2nd: The recent expanded meeting of the Tianjin Municipal People's Committee held a detailed discussion on the current market price situation in Tianjin.

Tianjin Vice Mayor Song Jingyi analyzed the current market price situation in Tianjin at the meeting. He said that China's prices have been stable for several years, and maintaining price stability will remain a long-term policy in the future. At present, the prices of the most basic necessities for people's lives, such as grain, cloth, and coal, have not changed. The commodities whose prices have risen recently are mainly non-staple foods. Because the spring cold lasted longer and the season was delayed, Tianjin experienced a heavy snow on April 8th and another frost on the 11th, resulting in a smaller supply of many non-staple foods compared to the same period last year. According to historical patterns, non-staple foods always have seasonal price differences, and it is inevitable that this year's price differences are larger than in previous years. If the factors of price increases for these seasonal commodities are removed, then the price adjustments of other small portions of commodities have a very small proportion in people's lives. Some of these commodities have seen price increases because the state has raised purchase prices to stimulate agricultural and sideline production, such as live pigs and sesame. Bamboo, rattan, mats, umbrellas and other handicrafts also had low purchase prices in the past, which affected production. Now, reasonable adjustments have been made in the producing areas, and the selling prices have also been increased accordingly. The price adjustments of a small number of industrial products and handicrafts are mainly due to insufficient raw material supply and increased costs. Song Jingyi said that the price adjustments of a small portion of commodities on the market are not appropriate, which is due to the government's still having shortcomings in the management of the market and prices.

After discussing the above situation, the Tianjin Municipal People's Committee's expanded meeting decided to continue to strengthen price management and properly resolve the current market price issues, and proposed seven specific measures: First, under the leadership of the Municipal People's Committee, relevant departments will be organized to inspect and handle the increased commodity prices, and unreasonable prices will be returned to their original prices or adjusted to reasonable price levels; it is necessary to strengthen the management of commodity retail prices, and price adjustments must be reported to the Municipal People's Committee for approval; the Industrial and Commercial Bureau is responsible for strengthening the management of small vendors and peddlers, mobilizing farmers who have automatically flowed into Tianjin to return to their hometowns, and gradually banning unlicensed stalls; stop the illegal phenomenon of price gouging; vigorously develop non-staple food bases to basically solve the supply of non-staple foods; relevant commercial departments should take different measures for different commodities to actively organize sources of goods and increase supply; at the same time, study and improve the methods of mastering the sources of goods and distributing consumption of some commodities. The Municipal People's Committee decided to conduct a publicity and education campaign for all employees, cadres, and citizens by system in the near future to explain the current market price situation and the measures taken by the government, and gradually mobilize all citizens to supervise retail businesses.

    妥善解决当前市场物价问题
    天津决定采取七项具体措施
    据新华社天津2日电  最近举行的天津市人民委员会扩大会议对目前天津市场的物价情况作了详细讨论。
    天津市副市长宋景毅在会上对当前天津市场物价情况作了分析。他说，几年来我国的物价一直是稳定的，而且稳定物价仍是今后长期的方针。就目前来说，粮食、布匹、煤炭等人民生活中最基本的必需物资的价格都没有变动。最近价格有所上升的部分商品主要是一些副食品。因为今年春寒延长季节推迟，4月8日天津还下了一场大雪，11日又来了一次霜冻，使得许多副食品的上市量比去年同季减少。根据历年规律，副食品都是有季节差价的，今年差价较往年大些也是必然的，如果把这些季节性商品价格上升的因素减除，那么其他少部分商品价格的调整，在人民生活中所占的比重就是极小的了。这些商品中一部分是由于国家为了刺激农副业生产而提高收购价格的，如生猪、芝麻等。竹藤、凉席、雨伞等手工业品过去也因为产地收购价格偏低，影响生产，现在产地已作了合理调整，出售价格也相应提高了一些。还有少数工业品和手工业品价格的调整，主要是由于一些原料供应不足，成本提高了。宋景毅说，目前市场上也有少部分商品的调价不够恰当，这是由于政府对市场和物价的管理工作仍有缺陷。
    天津市人民委员会扩大会议根据上述情况讨论后，确定继续加强物价管理工作，妥善解决当前市场物价问题，并提出了七项具体措施：首先在市人民委员会领导下，组织有关部门检查处理上调的商品价格，不合理的要调回原价和调至合理价格水平；要加强商品零售价格的管理工作，调价时要报市人民委员会批准；责成工商局加强小商小贩的管理工作，动员自动流入天津的农民还乡，逐步取缔无照经营的摊商；制止抬价违法现象；大力发展副食品基地，以基本解决副食品的供应问题；各有关商业部门应分别不同商品，采取不同措施，积极组织货源，增加供应；同时还要研究改进部分商品的货源掌握和消费分配的方法。市人民委员会确定在最近就按系统向全体职工、干部和市民进行一次宣传教育，向他们说明当前市场物价的情况和政府采取的措施，并逐步发动全体市民对零售商业进行监督。
