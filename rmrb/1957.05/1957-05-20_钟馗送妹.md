Zhong Kui Sends His Sister

Recently, the Ministry of Culture lifted the ban on more than twenty previously prohibited dramas, including "The Big Coffin Split," "Capturing Wang Kui Alive," "The Complete Zhong Kui," and the Sichuan opera "Zhong Kui Sends His Sister." This has greatly piqued my interest, especially the Zhong Kui plays, and I wonder how they are done and why they were banned. I suppose it's due to superstition, as it's all ghost stories, not just one scene with ghosts. I don't know if these plays are related to the novel "Zhong Kui Catches Ghosts," but if they are, then it's a continuous stream of ghost tales. No wonder it caused such a stir during the enlightenment era, being considered such a big deal.

As for "Zhong Kui Sends His Sister," that's probably just a section with comedic elements, right? Zhong Kui, with his wild hair and terrifying appearance, supposedly has a beautiful sister. This pairing is excellent, just like Su Dongpo having a sister Su Xiaomei, providing excellent material for stories. It has indeed appeared in paintings; I saw it in "Illustrious Paintings of Celebrities at Sea," specifically painted by Qian Hui'an, a recluse of Qingxi. I remember the little sister sitting in a carriage, pushed by a ghost, with Zhong Kui wearing a floral crown and carrying a sword, riding a donkey behind, and a ghost carrying luggage. There was no sequel after this, but there is a sequel in a joke, supposedly about what happened after the little sister got married. On Zhong Kui's birthday, his sister sent a ghost to carry a gift, one end of the pole carrying wine and the other end carrying a ghost tied up in a bundle. Attached was a letter that read:

　　A jar of wine, a ghost,
　　Sent to my brother to mince and roast.
　　If brother thinks the gift is small,
　　Include the one carrying the pole, that's two in all.

After reading the letter, Zhong Kui ordered both ghosts to be sent to the kitchen. The tied-up ghost said to the one carrying the pole, "I'm done for. Why did you have to carry this burden!" This joke appears in a Ming Dynasty book, deliberately created to mock people, but it also shows that Zhong Kui already had a sister.

The Chinese people's wisdom is admirable in using mythology to create comedies. "Havoc in Heaven" uses the Jade Emperor and Lao Tzu to accompany a monkey, and "The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl" uses the Queen Mother of the West to accompany a pair of cattle-herding lovers. The only religious drama, "Mulian Saves His Mother," is drawn out and becomes humorous, with only the final scene remaining important. The Chinese people are optimistic and bright, using superstition as material but transforming it into excellent dramas. After watching, they completely forget about the superstition and treat it as a game. Dongpo once asked someone to tell a ghost story, but they replied that there was nothing to say. He said, "Let's just make something up." This is the wonder of telling ghost stories, which is also the charm of ghosts appearing in plays. I suspect that ghosts appearing in Chinese plays often have this intention: the ghost doesn't show the ghost's scariness, and the god doesn't show the god's awesomeness. This is a characteristic of Chinese plays.

    钟馗送妹	启明
    近时文化部将从前所禁止的戏剧二十几种开禁，其中有“大劈棺”，“活捉王魁”等，还有“全部钟馗”，以及川剧“钟馗送妹”在内。这事很引起我的兴趣，特别是钟馗的戏，不知道是怎么做法，什么地方犯禁。我想这大概是迷信，因为全部鬼话，不但是一场出鬼而已。不知道这戏与小说“钟馗捉鬼传”有无相干，若是有的则全本鬼话连篇，难怪在启蒙时代要大惊小怪，认为是了不得了。
    至于钟馗送妹，那大概是其中的一段落，带着喜剧色彩的吧？须发磔张，状貌可怕的钟馗，据说有一个俊俏的妹子，这配搭得很好，正如苏东坡之有苏小妹，有很好的文章可做。在绘画上确曾有过，看见“海上名人画稿”，内中曾经有过，记得是清溪樵子钱慧安所绘，小妹坐在车内，一鬼推着，钟馗花冠带剑，骑驴跟在后面，鬼挑着行李。这以后别无下文，但在笑话里另有后文，大约是在小妹出嫁后的事了。钟馗生日，妹差一鬼挑担送礼，一头是酒，一头是一个鬼捆做一团。外附一封信云：
      酒一坛，鬼一个，
      送与哥哥做点剁。
      哥哥若嫌礼物少，
      连挑担的是两个。
    馗阅信毕，便命将两个鬼都送厨房。捆着的鬼对挑担的说道，“我是没有法子。你何苦挑这个担子！”这个笑话见于明朝人的书里，是故意编了来挖苦人的，但也可见钟馗已有妹子存在了。
    利用神话来编喜剧，中国人民的智慧是很可佩服的。“闹天宫”之用玉皇大帝，太上老君来陪衬一个毛猴，“天河配”之用西王母来陪衬一对牛女（耕织的男女），都是很大的对比。唯一的宗教剧“目连救母”，拉得很长，都滑稽化了，要紧的只剩得一场做收束。中国人是乐天明朗的民族，利用迷信做材料，却转变成很好的戏剧，看过去豁然都忘了，不让它留着，只当作游戏看去。昔东坡叫人说鬼，答说没得可说，他说“姑妄言之”。这是说鬼，也就是戏中出鬼的妙处。我疑心中国戏上出鬼，多是此意，鬼不显出鬼的可怕，神也不见神的可畏，这是中国的戏的特点。
