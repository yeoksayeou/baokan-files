    What are the contradictions in handicraft cooperatives? How to solve them?
    Beijing Municipal Member Representative Conference launched a discussion
    (Our newspaper dispatch) What are the main contradictions existing in the current handicraft production cooperatives? How to solve them? This was the central issue discussed at the second first member representative conference of Beijing Handicraft Production Cooperatives from April 23rd to 27th.
    The representatives believed that the main contradictions in Beijing's handicrafts are between production and raw materials, between production and consumption, between members and leaders, and between the individual interests and collective interests of members.
    Regarding the contradiction of insufficient raw materials in production, the representatives believed that the characteristics of handicrafts could be brought into play in increasing production and practicing economy, and that solutions could be found by utilizing waste materials and actively expanding repair and refurbishment businesses. For example, if the Dongjiao Metal Machinery Cooperative utilizes the iron filings turned down by lathes and planers for production, it can save 70 tons of good materials a year and increase production by 15,000 tool hammer heads. If the sewing industry actively develops dismantling, repairing, and renovating businesses this year, producing 400,000 fewer cotton-padded clothes can save more than 60,000 bolts of new cloth and 400,000 jin of cotton, and can solve the production problems of 1,000 people for three months.
    Poor product quality, few varieties, and poor service quality are the main contradictions between current handicraft cooperatives and the vast number of consumers. The emergence of this contradiction is due, on the one hand, to the fact that the production capacity of handicrafts cannot keep up with the development of social needs, and on the other hand, it is also caused by many artificial shortcomings. Many cooperatives have unsound product quality systems and implement piece-rate wages, resulting in shoddy workmanship and the pursuit of quantity when products are in short supply and repair businesses are busy. For example, in the sewing industry, shirts processed for department stores are supposed to have seven stitches per inch, but only four or five stitches are sewn. Some bicycle and clock repair cooperatives do not guarantee the quality of repairs. A wooden shoe last cooperative made a batch of shoe lasts that did not meet specifications, and refused to rework them when people brought them back. Some cooperatives rebrand old products as "new products" to deceive customers. Therefore, the representatives believed that business management should be actively improved and the ideas and practices that harm the interests of consumers should be quickly eradicated.
    The contradiction between leaders and the masses is mainly reflected in the work style of the leadership. The representatives cited many examples at the meeting to illustrate that the bureaucratic work style of some cadres at all levels of the organization is quite serious. Representatives from the construction cooperative said that a request was written last year, and traveled within the general cooperative for more than a month, and the final answer was "You solve it yourselves." A representative from the First Filigree Cooperative said that they hadn't seen any cadres from the office since their cooperative moved to the Qianmen district for several months. The director of a grassroots cooperative never goes to the workshop. Once, he went there by chance, and the members sarcastically said to him: "Director, you've come to the wrong door." This bureaucratic style has caused difficulties in many work links, dragged many problems unresolved, and further deepened many contradictions. The representatives believed that democratic life must be improved in the future, and leading cadres must establish a work style of relying on the masses and consulting with the masses in all matters.
    When studying the contradiction between individual and collective interests within the cooperatives, the representatives proposed that the tendency of neglecting accumulation and simply relying on reducing accumulation to increase the income of members must be corrected. One representative cited the Seventh Hat Cooperative as an example, saying that the cooperative initially reduced accumulation to increase income, with each person's income increasing by only 2% on average. Later, they improved the labor organization and improved production efficiency, and the average income of members increased by 23%, and accumulation was not affected. The representatives also proposed that in resolving the income problem of members, on the one hand, the bureaucratic style of disregarding the hardships of members should be corrected, and on the other hand, the collectivist education should be strengthened for some members who disregard the existing conditions and blindly emphasize individual interests, and the problem should be solved ideologically.

    手工业社有哪些矛盾？怎样解决？
    北京市社员代表大会展开讨论
    本报讯　目前，手工业生产合作社存在着哪些主要矛盾？如何解决？这是4月23日到27日，北京市手工业生产合作社第二届第一次社员代表大会讨论的中心问题。
    代表们认为当前北京市手工业中主要的矛盾，是生产和原料之间、生产和消费之间、社员和领导之间，以及社员个人利益和集体利益之间的矛盾。
    对于生产中原料不足的矛盾，代表们认为可以在增产节约中发挥手工业的特点，从多方利用废料碎料、以及采取积极扩展修理翻新业务等办法来解决。例如：东郊金属机械社如果利用车床、刨床旋下的铁屑生产，一年便可以节约七十吨好料，可以增产一万五千个工具锤头。缝纫业今年如果积极开展拆修翻新业务，少制作四十万件棉衣，就能少用六万多匹新布和四十万斤棉花，并且可以解决一千人三个月的生产问题。
    产品质量差、品种不多、服务质量不高，这是当前手工业合作社和广大消费者之间的主要矛盾。这个矛盾的产生，一方面是由于手工业的生产能力赶不上社会需要的发展，另一方面也是由许多人为的缺点造成的。不少社的产品质量制度不健全，又实行计件工资，在产品供不应求、修理业务繁忙的时候，就产生了粗制滥造、追求数量的现象。例如缝纫业，百货公司加工的衬衣，规定一吋缝七针，结果只缝了四针或五针。有些自行车和钟表修理社，不保证修理质量。木楦社给人家做的一批鞋楦不合规格，人家拿回来也不给返修。有些社把旧产品改头换面，名之曰“新产品”，以欺骗顾客。因此，代表们认为，应该积极改进经营管理，迅速铲除损害消费者利益的思想和作风。
    领导和群众的矛盾，主要表现在领导人员的工作作风上面。代表们在会上举出许多事例，说明各级组织某些干部的官僚主义作风相当严重。修建社代表说，去年写了一个请示，在总社内部旅行了一个多月，最后的回答是“你们自己解决吧”。第一花丝社代表说，他们社转到前门区以后，好几个月都没有见到办事处的干部。有个基层社的主任从来不下车间，有次偶然去了，社员讽刺他说：“主任你走错门了吧。”这种官僚主义的作风造成了许多工作环节上的困难，使许多问题拖而不决，使许多矛盾更为加深。代表们认为，今后必须健全民主生活，领导干部要树立依靠群众、遇事和群众商量的作风。
    在研究处理社内个人利益和集体利益的矛盾时，代表们提出必须纠正忽视积累和单纯依靠减少积累增加社员收入的偏向。有一个代表以第七制帽社为例说，这个社最初以减少积累来增加收入，每人平均只增加收入2％，后来改善了劳动组织，提高了生产效率，社员的平均收入增加了23％，积累也不受影响。代表们还提出，在解决社员收入问题上，一方面要纠正不顾社员疾苦的官僚主义作风，另一方面，对一些不顾现有条件、一味强调个人利益的社员，应该加强集体主义教育，从思想上解决问题。
