    At the Party Leadership Group Meeting of the Ministry of Culture

    The Key to Solving Problems

    How should we understand the significance of the rectification campaign for our work? This question was raised at the beginning of the joint meeting of the Party Leadership Group and the Party Committee of the Ministry of Culture held on the morning of the 4th. Some people said: In the work of the cultural departments, the contradiction between the people's demands for culture and the cultural departments' supply of culture is concentratedly reflected. The key to resolving this contradiction is how to correctly organize the forces on the cultural front, give full play to the enthusiasm of all parties, and serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers. There are many contradictions in all aspects of the cultural departments. Errors on the subjective side have sharpened these contradictions. For a long time, the leadership of the Ministry of Culture has been trying to find the key to solving these contradictions but without success, so that many problems cannot be solved in a timely manner, there are many opinions from all parties, and the leadership is also very distressed. Now, the central government's instructions on the rectification campaign have helped us find the key to solving the problem, which is to overcome dogmatism, sectarianism, and bureaucratism in leadership, and learn to correctly handle contradictions among the people.

    Leading Personnel of the Ministry Must Take the First Step

    In this rectification campaign, should the leading cadres of the ministry take the first step, or should everyone advance at the same pace? This was the second question discussed at the meeting. Everyone believed that the success or failure of the rectification campaign depends on the quality of the rectification of the leading cadres of the ministry. Therefore, it is necessary to ensure that the leading cadres are properly rectified. When talking about specific arrangements, some people advocated carrying it out in two batches: the leading cadres first, and then the general cadres and institutions and enterprises. Some people said that this would not work: in some units, the masses actively demanded to start the rectification campaign, and some prominent problems in some units needed to be solved urgently. It is not allowed to separate the leading cadres from the general cadres and the units affiliated to the ministry. It should be started together, but different requirements can be put forward. After discussion, it was unanimously agreed that the leading cadres of the ministry must take the lead. This depends on the high degree of self-consciousness of the leading cadres. At the beginning, it is best to conduct four rectification study sessions per week. At the same time, the work should be properly arranged, the urgent problems must be solved, and others can be temporarily put aside. In addition, it is necessary to give play to the enthusiasm of the lower-level leadership, and let them block what they can block.

    Should it be Divided into Stages?

    When discussing the steps of the rectification campaign, some people initially advocated dividing it into three stages: the first stage is to carefully study the documents (taking one month); the second stage is to check work, check thoughts and work style, and solve problems (taking two months); the third stage is to summarize experience and consolidate achievements (taking one month). Once discussed, it was found that this was not practical. Documents cannot be studied behind closed doors for so long, and summaries cannot be made so quickly. In particular, the main leading cadres of the ministry, after rectifying themselves, went to lead the rectification campaign; in the process of leading the rectification campaign, they heard other people's opinions and made further reflections, until the end of the rectification campaign, it should be regarded as the process of the main leading cadres of the ministry rectifying their own thinking and work style. In this process, many practical problems must be solved. In short, this spirit should be implemented from beginning to end: combining theory with practice, learning, listening, rectifying, and reforming at the same time.

    What Should Be Grasped Tightly and What Should Be Relaxed?

    To achieve both rectification and work without hindrance, it is necessary to grasp the main work and reduce some work that can be reduced. But which should be reduced and which cannot be reduced? The meeting determined the following principle: the main business, and the business directly related to the masses cannot be reduced. For example, the tour performances of various theaters and troupes should not be reduced or stopped, otherwise, the original contradictions will be deepened. Some administrative work can be appropriately reduced. Some meetings can be postponed or cancelled, and some reports can be issued less frequently or not at all. Specific projects are arranged by each bureau, department, and various institutions and enterprises.

    在文化部的党组会上
    刘甲
    解决问题的关键
    怎样认识整风对我们工作的意义？4日上午举行的中共文化部党组和中共文化部党委联席会一开始就谈到了这个问题。有人说：在文化部门的工作中，集中地反映了人民对文化的要求同文化部门对文化供应之间的矛盾。解决这个矛盾的关键，是如何正确地组织文化战线上的力量，充分发挥各方面的积极性，来为工农兵服务。文化部门的各个环节上，有许多矛盾。主观方面的错误，使这些矛盾尖锐起来。长久以来文化部的领导上设法找寻解决这些矛盾的关键而不可得，以致许多问题不能及时解决，各方面的意见满多，领导上也很苦闷。现在，中央关于整风的指示帮助我们找到了解决问题的关键，这就是克服领导上的教条主义、宗派主义和官僚主义，学会正确地处理人民内部矛盾。
    部的领导人员必须先走一步
    这次整风，是部的领导干部先走一步呢，还是上下齐头并进呢？这是会上讨论的第二个问题。大家认为：部的领导干部整得好坏，是整风成败的关键。因此必须保证领导干部整好。谈到怎样具体安排，有人主张分成两批进行，领导干部先进行，然后一般干部和事业企业单位再进行。有人说这样不行：有些单位，群众积极要求开始整风，有些单位的一些突出问题急需解决，不容许把领导干部和一般干部以及部的所属单位截然分开，应该一齐开始，但可以提出不同的要求。经过讨论，一致认为部的领导干部必须抢先一步。这要靠领导干部的高度自觉，在开始时，每周最好进行四次整风学习。同时，工作要适当安排一下，急需要解决的问题必须解决，其他可暂时放一下。另外，要发挥下层领导的积极性，它们能挡住的就挡一下。
    要不要分阶段
    在讨论整风步骤的时候，开始有人主张分为三个阶段：第一阶段精读文件（用一个月时间）；第二阶段检查工作，检查思想、作风，解决问题（用二个月时间）；第三阶段总结经验，巩固成果（用一个月）。一经讨论，便发现这并不切合实际。文件既不能关起门来读那样久，总结也不能作得那样快。特别是部的主要领导干部，整了自己，又去领导整风；在领导整风的过程中，又听到了别人的意见，作进一步的反省，直到整风结束，都应当看作是部的主要领导干部整顿自己的思想作风的过程。在这当中，许多实际问题是要加以解决的。总之，从头到尾都应当贯彻这种精神：理论联系实际，边学、边听、边整、边改。
    应该抓紧的和应该放松的
    要作到整风、工作两不误，必须抓住主要工作，减少一些可以减少的工作。但是哪些应该减少，哪些不能减少呢？会上确定了这样一个原则：主要的业务，与群众直接有关的业务不能减少。比如关于各剧院、剧团的巡回演出就不应减少或停止，否则，就会越加加深原有的矛盾。而一些行政工作可以适当减少。有的会可以不开，可以缓开，有的报表可以不发，可以少发。具体的项目由各局、司和各事业企业单位去安排。
