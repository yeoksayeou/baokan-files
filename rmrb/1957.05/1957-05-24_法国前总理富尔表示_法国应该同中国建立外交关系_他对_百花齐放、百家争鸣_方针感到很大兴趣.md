Xinhua News Agency, May 23rd — Former French Prime Minister Edgar Faure said in Beijing tonight that France should establish diplomatic relations with China.

Tonight, Zhang Xiruo, President of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, held a banquet at the Beijing Hotel to welcome Faure and his wife. At the banquet, Faure said that when he was Prime Minister, he tried his best to develop Franco-Chinese relations, primarily economic and cultural relations. However, he said, "Frankly speaking, this is only part of the diplomatic relations we want to establish, and we should also establish comprehensive relations." However, he said that he did not propose recognizing China and establishing diplomatic relations when he was Prime Minister.

Faure said that at the 1955 Geneva Conference, he believed that the issue of New China's seat in the United Nations should be resolved in a comprehensive manner. Now, he is still willing to do his best and contribute in this regard.

Faure said that they were very happy to visit China, a revolutionary country. France also underwent an important revolution—the world's first anti-feudal revolution. The revolutionary descendants of France view the Chinese revolution with fraternal feelings.

Faure said that he was very interested in China's ongoing "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" movement and would study it. He said: "Revolution is a constantly developing cause. Under the initiative of Chairman Mao Zedong, you are creating a new revolution through 'Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend.'"

He believes that different economic structures cannot prevent understanding and exchanges between countries. He also believes that each country can draw on the successful experiences of other countries. To achieve this, he said, "First of all, we must safeguard peace."

Zhang Xiruo spoke at the beginning of the banquet. He said that the Chinese people have great respect and deep friendship for the French people. China and France have had a long period of exchanges. He asked the guests to feel at home in China.

He said: "We are very happy to see that Sino-French relations are constantly improving, and exchanges between the two countries are constantly improving. What makes us even happier is that during Mr. Faure's tenure as Prime Minister, exchanges and relations between the two countries have increased even more."

He said that Faure had repeatedly mentioned that the government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legal government of the Chinese people and that China should be restored to its seat in the United Nations. He expressed his admiration and gratitude for this.

He expressed his belief that Faure's visit to China would further enhance the friendship between China and France.

Among those present at the banquet tonight were Chen Shutong, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Zhang Bojun, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Vice Presidents of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, and well-known figures from all walks of life in Beijing.

    法国前总理富尔表示
    法国应该同中国建立外交关系
    他对“百花齐放、百家争鸣”方针感到很大兴趣
    新华社23日讯　法国前总理富尔今晚在北京说，法国应该同中国建立外交关系。
    今晚，中国人民外交学会会长张奚若在北京饭店举行了宴会，欢迎富尔和他的夫人。富尔在宴会上说，在他担任总理的时候，他曾经尽力发展法中两国关系，首先是经济和文化关系。但是，他说：“坦率地说，这只是我们要建立的外交关系的一部分，我们还应建立起全面关系。”但是，他说，他在任总理时未提出承认中国和建立外交关系。
    富尔说，他在1955年日内瓦会议上曾认为新中国在联合国的席位问题应在总的方面予以解决。现在，他仍愿在这方面尽他的力量，作出贡献。
    富尔说，他们能到中国这个革命的国家来访问，感到很高兴。法国也进行过一次重要革命——世界上第一次的反封建主义革命。法国的革命子孙，是以兄弟般的心情来看待中国的革命的。
    富尔说，他对中国正在进行的“百花齐放、百家争鸣”运动感到很大兴趣，并且要研究它。他说：“革命是不断发展的事业，你们在毛泽东主席的倡议下通过‘百花齐放、百家争鸣’创造新的革命。”
    他认为，经济结构的不同，并不能阻止国与国间的了解和往来。他还认为，每个国家都可以利用其他国家成功的经验。要做到这点，他说：“首先要把和平保卫起来。”
    张奚若在宴会开始时讲话。他说，中国人民对法国人民有崇高的敬意和深厚的友情。中国同法国有相当长时期的交往。他请客人在中国如像在家中。
    他说：“我们很高兴地看到，中法两国关系有不断的改进，两国来往有不断的改进。更使我们高兴的是，在富尔先生任总理期间，两国来往和关系有更大的增进。”
    他说，富尔曾多次提到中华人民共和国政府是中国人民唯一的合法政府，并且认为应该恢复中国在联合国的席位。对此，他表示钦佩和感谢。
    他表示相信，富尔来中国访问，会更加增进中法两国的友谊。
    出席今晚宴会的，有全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长陈叔通，政协全国委员会副主席章伯钧，中国人民外交学会副会长和北京各界著名人士。
