Xinhua News Agency, May 27th - The first representative conference of advanced ordnance workers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army opened in Beijing today.

　　Six hundred and thirty-one representatives of advanced ordnance workers attended the conference. Among them were representatives of a certain company who had paid attention to the maintenance and upkeep of weapons and had not had an accident in five years; representatives of a certain repair shop who diligently traveled to more than a dozen islands to repair weapons for the troops and had not allowed a damaged weapon to leave the position in two years; Chen Jibin, an assistant of a certain unit who actively studied technology and successfully trial-produced a warning radar training machine, making a significant contribution to the troops' completion of training tasks; assistant Chen Shuqi, who proposed and personally designed a combined gasoline generator and electric welding machine, each of which can save the country 13,500 yuan; and Bao Jingzhi, a first-class technical expert who relied on the masses, worked hard to study, and improved and created more than 700 large and small tools, ensuring the completion of artillery and ammunition test tasks.

　　Marshal Ye Jianying, Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council, General Chen Geng, Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and General Gan Siqi, Deputy Director of the General Political Department, attended the opening ceremony this morning.

　　General Wang Shusheng, Vice Minister of National Defense and Minister of the General Ordnance Department, delivered the opening speech at the meeting. He said that the purpose of this meeting is to commend and reward advanced ordnance workers and advanced units, exchange and promote advanced experience, better bring into play mass wisdom, mobilize all positive forces, and further strengthen the building of ordnance work.

　　General Wang Shusheng said that ordnance work had made achievements in the past, but there were also many shortcomings and errors, mainly due to our bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism. He hoped that the representatives would use the spirit of rectification in this meeting to strictly criticize the leadership of the Ordnance Department to help the leadership rectify.

　　At the meeting, Marshal Ye Jianying gave important instructions on correctly understanding the position and role of ordnance work and implementing the principle of building the army diligently and thriftily in ordnance work.

　　He said that the urgent task of the ordnance departments and ordnance cadres is to vigorously attach importance to the march towards science and technology so that ordnance work can adapt to the needs of the modernization of our army.

　　Marshal Ye Jianying said that our army has proposed building the army diligently and thriftily, which is an action slogan for implementing the Central Committee's instructions on carrying out the movement to increase production and practice economy, and it is also a regular political task of our army. The ordnance departments control a large amount of materials and funds and have great potential for savings. If they carefully calculate everywhere on the premise of ensuring quality, it is possible to make great achievements in savings.

　　This afternoon, Major General Feng Yongshun, Deputy Minister of the General Ordnance Department, made a report to the conference on behalf of the Party Committee of the General Ordnance Department, "Striving to Further Strengthen the Building of Ordnance Work."

　　The meeting will continue.

    新华社27日讯　中国人民解放军首届军械先进工作者代表会议今天在北京开幕。
    六百三十一名先进军械工作者代表出席了这次会议。其中有注意维护、保养武器，五年来从未发生事故的某连代表；有辛勤地往返在十多个岛屿上为部队修理武器，两年中没有使损坏的武器离开阵地的某修械所代表；有积极钻研技术，试制成功警戒雷达训练机，对部队完成训练任务贡献重大的某部助理员陈吉斌；有倡议并亲手设计组合汽油发电机、电焊机，每台可为国家节约资金一万三千五百元的助理员陈书岐；有依靠群众，刻苦钻研，改进和创造了大小工具七百多件，保证完成火炮和弹药试验任务的一级技术能手包静芝。

    王树声大将说，过去军械工作是有成绩的，但也存在着不少缺点和错误，这主要是由于我们的官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义造成的。他希望代表们在这次会议上以整风精神，对军械部的领导进行严格的批评，以帮助领导整风。
    会上，叶剑英元帅就正确认识军械工作的地位、作用和在军械工作中贯彻勤俭建军方针作了重要指示。
    他说，军械部门、军械干部刻不容缓的任务就是要大力重视向科学技术进军，使军械工作适应我军现代化建设的需要。
