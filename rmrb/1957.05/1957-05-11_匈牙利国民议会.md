		Hungarian National Assembly
		The Hungarian National Assembly is the highest organ of state power and the sole legislative body of the Hungarian People's Republic. Deputies are nominated by electoral districts, and citizens who have reached the age of eighteen elect them through direct, universal, and equal suffrage by secret ballot. The current National Assembly (elected in June 1953) has a total of 453 deputies. According to the Constitution, the National Assembly is re-elected every four years, but its term may be extended to a certain period as decided by the National Assembly.
		The functions and powers of the National Assembly are: to approve the state budget and the national economic plan, to elect the Presidium and the Council of Ministers of the People's Republic, to decide on declarations of war and peace, and to exercise the power of amnesty. The Assembly has legislative power, and every bill becomes law if it is approved by a majority of the deputies present. However, amendments to the Constitution require the approval of more than two-thirds of all deputies.
		The National Assembly holds at least two regular sessions each year, but meetings shall also be convened upon the written request of more than one-third of the deputies or the decision of the Presidium of the Hungarian People's Republic.
		The Presidium of the Hungarian People's Republic is elected from among the deputies at the first meeting of each National Assembly. It is composed of one chairman, two vice-chairmen, one secretary, and seventeen members. The Presidium of the Hungarian People's Republic is a permanent body of the National Assembly, responsible to and reports its work to the National Assembly. It exercises the functions and powers of the Assembly during recesses of the National Assembly, but has no power to amend the Constitution. The main functions and powers of the Presidium are: to decide on the election of the National Assembly, to convene the National Assembly, to submit bills, to have the power to hold national referendums on important state issues, to represent the Hungarian People's Republic in concluding and ratifying international treaties, to appoint and accept diplomatic representatives, to appoint state public servants in statutory leading positions and senior commanders of the armed forces, to recommend candidates for members of the Council of Ministers to the National Assembly, and to exercise the power of remission of sentences, etc.
		Since the events of last October, in order to further strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, reduce state expenditures, and improve economic management, the Presidium of the Hungarian People's Republic has promulgated a series of decrees, among which the important ones are: the decree on requiring permission to hold parades and assemblies, the decree on organizing workers' committees in factories and enterprises, the decree on the implementation of military justice throughout the country, and the decree determining the regulations for armed protection of factories, as well as the decree on streamlining government agencies and the decree on national land issues, etc.

    匈牙利国民议会
    匈牙利国民议会是匈牙利人民共和国的最高国家权力机关和唯一的立法机关。议员由各选区提出候选人名单，由年满十八岁的公民按照直接、普遍、平等的原则以不记名投票方式选出。本届国民议会（1953年6月选出）议员共有四百五十三名。根据宪法规定，国民议会每四年改选一次，但经国民议会决定得延长其任期至一定的期限。
    国民议会的职权是：批准国家预算和国民经济计划，选举人民共和国主席团和部长会议，决定宣战与媾和，行使大赦权。议会有立法权，每一法案如经国民议会出席议员过半数投票赞成即成为法律。但宪法的修改须经全体议员三分之二以上的赞成。
    国民议会每年至少举行常会两次，但如有三分之一以上议员的书面要求或匈牙利人民共和国主席团决定亦应召集会议。
    匈牙利人民共和国主席团是在每届国民议会第一次会议上从议员中选出的，由主席一人、副主席二人、秘书一人和委员十七人组成。匈牙利人民共和国主席团是国民议会的常设机构，对国民议会负责并向其报告工作。在国民议会休会期间执行议会的职权，但无权修改宪法。主席团的主要职权是：决定国民议会的选举、召集国民议会、提出法案、有权就国家重要问题举行全民公决、代表匈牙利人民共和国缔结和批准国际条约、任命和接受外交代表、任命法定领导职位的国家公务人员和武装力量的高级指挥人员、向国民议会推荐部长会议委员的人选，行使免罪减刑权等。
    自从去年十月事件后，为了进一步加强无产阶级专政，减少国家的开支，改善经济管理，匈牙利人民共和国主席团颁布了一系列的法令，其中重要的有：关于举行游行和集会需要得到许可的法令、关于工厂企业中组织工人委员会的法令、关于全国实行军法审判的法令和确定武装保卫工厂条例的法令、以及精简政府机构的法令和全国土地问题的法令等。
