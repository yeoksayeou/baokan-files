Wuhan, May 16 (From our newspaper) "We need equal treatment, mutual trust, like a family." This was the opinion raised by many non-Party members at a forum convened by the Wuhan Municipal Party Committee on the 15th.

At this forum, attended by the First Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, everyone requested further close relations between the Party and non-Party members. The traditional painter Zhang Zhaoming said, "After the Party strengthened its work with intellectuals, it cared for us in life, but no one cared about our political thoughts for a long time." The writer Li Rui said, "Sometimes we can see the leaders of the Municipal Party Committee at meetings, but it is limited to shaking hands and exchanging pleasantries, without any contact of ideas."

At the meeting, everyone criticized the abnormal relationship between the Party and the masses in their own units. Han Opera actor Wu Tianbao talked about a former Party branch secretary in the Han Opera Troupe who, because some people had opinions about him, wrote in the work plan: "Some cadres look down on the Party," equating himself with the Party, which caused a lot of people to have opinions. Li Rui also talked about some Party member writers who hold leading positions who have not created for more than ten years, write very few articles on literary and artistic theory, are busy with meetings all day long, do not study well, make slow progress, and are not modest in handling problems. Opera director Bao Zhaoshou reflected that the leading cadres of the theater would often say that people were "backward." He himself wore the hat of backwardness for several years, but after becoming a People's Representative this year, he became not backward in one morning. Professor Cheng Qianfan also gave an example criticizing the Wuhan University Party organization for designating a certain person as an advanced worker in order to cultivate his prestige as a Party member, and exaggerating his deeds, which instead made this person even less prestigious among the masses.

When talking about the implementation of the "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" policy in Wuhan's literary and art circles, Zhang Zhaoming talked about the art exhibition held last year, in which many painters who had put down their brushes for many years picked them up again and painted with great excitement, but what was the attitude of the provincial and municipal leaders? He said: "When awarding prizes, we invited the directors of the provincial and municipal cultural bureaus to participate. If the director was busy, the secretary could attend, or even send a general cadre, but no one from the two cultural bureaus came, so we had to close quietly." Cheng Qianfan also mentioned that he organized literary and artistic lectures in the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, and some people came from twenty miles away in the suburbs to listen, and the masses were very enthusiastic. However, the speakers invited were all non-Party members, and Party member cadres could not be invited.

Everyone also criticized the editors of magazines and publishing houses and individual Party member cadres for not respecting other people's labor.

### 平等相待　互相信任  武汉文艺界要求进一步密切党群关系

    平等相待　互相信任
    武汉文艺界要求进一步密切党群关系
    本报武汉16日电“要平等相待，互相信任，像一家人一样。”这是在中共武汉市委15日邀集的文艺界座谈会上，许多党外人士提的意见。
    在这个有市委第一书记参加的座谈会上，大家都要求进一步密切党与非党的关系。国画家张肇铭说：“党加强对知识分子的工作后，生活上关怀了，但政治思想上还是长期无人过问。”作家李蕤说：“有时开会也能见到市委领导同志，但仅限于握手道寒暖，不接触思想。”
    会上，大家对本单位党群关系不正常的问题提出了批评。汉剧演员吴天保谈到汉剧团以前有个支部书记，因为有人对他有意见，他就在工作计划上写上一条：“有些干部看不起党。”把他个人说成是党，闹的很多人有意见。李蕤也谈到有的担任领导职务的党员作家十多年不创作，文艺理论文章写的很少，成天忙于开会，学习也不好，进步很慢，在处理问题上还不谦虚。歌剧导演鲍昭寿反映剧院领导干部动辄就说人“落后”，他自己就戴了好几年落后的帽子，但今年当上人民代表后，一个早晨就变得不落后了。教授程千帆还举例批评武汉大学党组织为了培养某个入党对象的威信，指定选他为先进工作者，并将其事迹夸大，反而使这个人在群众中更没有威信。
    在谈到武汉文艺界贯彻“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针时，张肇铭谈到去年举办美术展览，很多搁笔多年的画家都重新提笔画了，很兴奋，但省、市领导的态度怎样呢？他说：“评奖时，我们请省、市文化局长参加，局长有事秘书也可以，甚至派个一般干部来也行，但两个文化局都没人来，只好悄悄收场。”程千帆也谈到他在中苏友协组织文艺讲座，有的人从郊区二十里外赶来听讲，群众很热情。但请来讲演的人都是党外人士，党员干部却请不来。
    大家对杂志、出版社编辑部和个别党员干部不尊重别人的劳动，也提出了批评。
