Abandoning "Mediocre Person Politics"
            Bu Wuji

    Seeing some recent events, I suddenly understood a principle, which is what Lu Xiangxian of the Tang Dynasty said: "The world is inherently without problems, but mediocre people trouble themselves." Indeed, some of our comrades, I don't know why, are busy all day long, doing things that are quite unnecessary. They are unwilling to let go of anything, they have to grasp it, and grasp it tightly.
    For example, comrades in a certain county issued an order to top all the cotton in the county on the same day. As a result, the cadres of the districts, townships, and agricultural cooperatives were kept busy, and they hurried to carry out a lot of mobilization and organizational work. As a result, many fields of cotton were topped even though they hadn't reached the time for topping.
    Such examples are not isolated. If we examine some of the things we have done, aren't they quite unnecessary! Take personnel work, for example, a part of it is also quite unnecessary.
    We created a bureaucratic institution ourselves, transferred batches of cadres, and then transferred many other people to do personnel work. We ourselves have to talk to them and hold meetings with them frequently, help them write reports, read reports, circulate reports, and so on. As a result, we are so busy that we can't cope, and so many cadres are all trapped in daily "official business" and can't get away. We comfort ourselves and everyone else, saying that we are doing work to serve the people, saying that these are indispensable "political" tasks. I think, if we must call these "politics," then it can only be called mediocre person politics. Generally speaking, all political activities that rely on subjective wishes, pursue superficial beauty, covet greatness and quick success, and lack practical results can be said to be "mediocre person politics" in essence. Besides letting those truly hopeless mediocre people indulge themselves, what use is this mediocre person politics?
    Now, some comrades are just shouting slogans about strengthening ideological and political work. They seem to be getting busier and busier every day, and they are stepping up meetings, talks, writing reports, and so on, sometimes even out of breath. These comrades actually don't understand what ideological and political work is, what the most urgent demands of the masses are. These comrades should be allowed to calm down and first think of a way to thoroughly oppose this set of mediocre person politics, so that they can become true political workers.
    However, it is not easy to be a true political worker after all, and many people often become mediocre people without realizing it. And there seem to be quite a few mediocre people in front of us, and some of them even have the power to issue orders. In this way, "mediocre person politics" cannot but be formed in some places. If they further develop this set of "mediocre person politics," the result will be like a quack doctor treating a disease, which will make things a complete mess.
    Lu Fangweng wrote in a poem: "Quack doctors control life, vulgar people discuss articles." This is a penetrating and pertinent warning. Think about it, if a patient encounters a quack doctor who prescribes medicine randomly and treats them randomly, a minor illness becomes a major illness, and a major illness leads to death. Isn't this life lost at the hands of the quack doctor? If a good article falls into the hands of a vulgar person, who thinks he knows everything, nitpicks, and adds arbitrary revisions, isn't it a pity? However, when a quack doctor is responsible for treating your illness, your life is in his hands; when a vulgar person becomes an editor, your article has to be arbitrarily discussed and selected by him.
    I myself have been sick and have been an editor, and I have some feelings about both. Saying a few heartfelt words is not alarmist. I hope that our comrades will think deeply and carefully about things, and never draft plans randomly, like quack doctors who prescribe medicine randomly, so as not to kill people; for all problems that you are not sure about, it is best not to make arbitrary decisions.
    However, someone will be very unhappy and ask: Isn't this abandoning leadership and letting things drift? Answer: It seems so, but it is not. Saying that it seems so, because our leadership is to boldly let go, let go, and let go again; since we let go so much, the original set of leadership methods may have to be changed, that is to say, in a sense, some degree of laissez-faire should be allowed. Saying that it is not actually, because there is still leadership in principle and direction after all, and it must not become a state of anarchy. And our people have received revolutionary education over the years, and we can also believe that they will not be too bad. Since this is the case, then there is nothing to be afraid of. Those who are afraid of trouble every day and shout "can't let go" every day are really worrying themselves and fussing for nothing.

    废弃“庸人政治”
            卜旡忌
    看到最近发生的一些事情，我突然领悟了一个道理，这就是唐朝的陆象先所谓“天下本无事，庸人自扰之。”的确，我们有的同志，不知道为什么，天天忙忙碌碌，做出一些大可不必做的事情。他们不管对什么都不肯放手，都要抓，而且抓得死死地。
    比如，某县的同志下过一道命令，叫把全县的棉花都在同一天打尖。于是，忙坏了区乡和农业合作社的干部，赶紧进行许多动员和组织的工作。结果有许多田里的棉花，没有到打尖的时候，也硬给打了尖。
    像这样的例子并不是个别的。我们查看一下自己做过的有些事情，何尝不是大可不必做的哩！就说人事工作吧，其中有一部分也是大可不必做的。
    我们自己搞了一个官僚主义的机构，调来一批又一批的干部，然后又调了另外的许多人来做人事工作，自己还要经常同他们谈话、开会，帮助他们写报告、看报告、批转报告，等等。结果使自己忙得不可开交，也使这么一大批干部全都陷在日常“公事”中不得解脱。我们自己还安慰自己，也安慰大家，说我们做的都是为人民服务的工作，说这些都是必不可少的“政治”工作。我想，假若一定要把这些都说成是“政治”的话，那末，这只能说是庸人政治。大概地说，凡是凭着主观愿望，追求表面好看，贪大喜功，缺乏实际效果的政治活动，在实质上都可以说是“庸人政治”。这种庸人政治除了让那些真正没出息的庸人自我陶醉以外，到底有什么用处呢？
    现在又有一些同志光在空喊要加强思想政治工作，他们显得一天天更加忙起来了，又在加紧开会、谈话、写报告，等等，有时连气都喘不过来。这些同志实际上可以说还不懂得什么是思想政治工作，什么是群众最迫切的要求。应该让这些同志冷静一下，先要想个办法，把这一套庸人政治彻底地反对掉，使自己成为真正的政治工作者。
    可是，要做一个真正的政治工作者毕竟是很不容易的，有许多人却往往不知不觉地就变成了庸人。而我们眼前的庸人似乎还不少，他们有的还有权发号施令。这样，就不能不在某些地方形成了“庸人政治”。他们如果进一步发展这一套“庸人政治”，其结果将如庸医治病一样，会把事情弄得一塌胡涂。
    陆放翁在一首诗里写道：“庸医司性命，俗子议文章。”这是切中要害的警句。想想看，病人碰到了庸医，乱开药方，乱治一阵，小病变成大病，大病则呜呼哀哉，这条性命不是丧在庸医之手吗？一篇好文章落在俗子手里，他自以为无所不通，吹毛求疵，滥加斧削，岂不可惜？但是，当着庸医负责治你的病的时候，你的性命就掌握在他的手里；当着俗子做了编辑的时候，你的文章也不得不由他随便议论和取舍了。
    我自己也患过病，也当过编辑，各种感受都有一些，说几句由衷之言，并非危言耸听。但愿我们的同志遇事深思熟虑，千万不要乱拟方案，像庸医那样乱开药方，以免害死了人；对于自己没有把握的一切问题，还是不滥作主张为好。
    然而，有人会很不高兴地责问：这不是放弃领导和放任自流吗？回答：似乎是，其实不是。说它似乎是，因为我们的领导是要大胆地放手、放手、再放手；既然如此放手，原来的一套领导方法恐怕就得改，也就是说，在某种意义上应该允许某种程度的放任。说它其实不是，因为在原则和方针上毕竟还有领导，决不能变成无政府状态。而我们的人民群众这些年来受了革命的教育，也可以相信他们不会差到那里去的。既然如此，就什么也不可怕了。那些天天怕出乱子，天天喊叫“放不得”的人，真是庸人自扰，瞎操心了。
