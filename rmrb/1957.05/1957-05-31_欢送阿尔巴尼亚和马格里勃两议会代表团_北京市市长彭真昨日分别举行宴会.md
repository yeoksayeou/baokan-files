Xinhua News Agency, May 30th—Beijing Mayor Peng Zhen held a banquet this evening to bid farewell to the People's Assembly Delegation from the People's Republic of Albania.

The delegation has been visiting various parts of China for nearly a month and will return home on the 1st.

At the banquet, Peng Zhen thanked the delegation for bringing the deep friendship of the Albanian people to the Chinese people. He said, "Although the imperialists are unhappy with our friendship and afraid of our unity, in fact, the unity of socialist countries will continue to be consolidated and developed, and the unity of socialist countries with all other peace-loving countries and people will continue to be strengthened. The cause of human progress and the cause of peace will continue to advance."

Peng Zhen asked the delegation to convey the friendship of the Chinese people to the Albanian people and the respect and greetings of the people of Beijing to the people of Tirana.

The head of the delegation, Rita Marko, Chairman of the People's Assembly of the People's Republic of Albania, said in his reply: "During our visit to China, we personally saw the laboring people of all strata full of confidence in their future and the cause of socialist construction. At the same time, we also saw the Chinese people's sympathy and friendship towards the Albanian people and the people of all countries, and their unremitting efforts for the cause of peace. We are pleased that in our contact with people from all walks of life, they humbly solicit our opinions and ask us to criticize various tasks. We will definitely convey everything we have seen in China to the Albanian people." He finally proposed a toast to the great achievements made by the Chinese people, to the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Albanian people, and to the health of Mayor Peng Zhen, Chairman Liu Shaoqi, Chairman Mao Zedong, and other leading comrades.

Delegation member and writer Qini Sako excitedly recited his poem "Common Road," created during his stay in China, which praised the friendship between Albania and China.

Albanian Ambassador to China, Balili, and his wife were invited to attend the banquet.

Those present at this evening's banquet included Li Jishen, Shen Junru, and Chen Shutong, Vice-Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress; Li Xiannian, Vice-Premier of the State Council; Zhang Bojun, Vice-Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference; Lu Dingyi, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress; Luo Shigao, China's Ambassador to Albania; Xu Yixin, former Ambassador to Albania; and responsible persons of the Beijing Municipal People's Committee.

Xinhua News Agency, May 30th—Beijing Mayor Peng Zhen held a banquet this noon to bid farewell to the Visiting Delegation of the National Consultative Assembly of the Maghreb (Morocco), who are about to leave Beijing and return to their country.

At the meeting, Peng Zhen said that the struggle of the Maghreb people for independence had greatly encouraged the Chinese people. Africa is far from China, but their fates are the same, that is, they have both suffered from imperialist enslavement, so their friendship is deep.

The head of the delegation, Haji Muhammad Buamrani, said that although we are far apart, we are spiritually united. Therefore, in the early part of the twentieth century, the struggle of the Asian and African people can be victorious.

Zhang Xiruo, Vice Mayor of Beijing and President of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, Bao Erhan, Vice President and Director of the China Islamic Association, Ke Hua, Director of the West Asia and Africa Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and others attended the banquet.
