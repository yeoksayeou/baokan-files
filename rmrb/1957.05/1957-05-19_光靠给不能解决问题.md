Giving Alone Cannot Solve Problems
          By our reporter Chen Ji
    The housing problem has always been a difficult one to solve at the First Automobile Works. Over the past few years, newly built and rented dormitories have reached more than 400,000 square meters, but they still cannot meet the needs of the employees. After the factory went into production, about 2,200 employees applied for family dormitories. These employees who needed housing mainly fell into the following categories: (1) Employees transferred from other places wanted to bring their families, requiring dormitories. Among the 2,200 employees, this was the case for more than 1,500 households. (2) Young employees wanted to get married and needed separate dormitories. (3) Some employees needed more housing because of the increase in family members. (4) Some engineers and technicians felt that their housing was too crowded and wanted more space. (5) Employees living in the city or in dormitories converted from temporary construction projects felt it was inconvenient to commute or disliked the dilapidated houses, requesting to move into standard dormitories near the factory area. The factory leadership did not conduct specific analyses or serious reviews to determine whether these requests were reasonable and feasible. At one point, the number of people requesting housing reached as high as five or six thousand. At that time, some leaders were extremely nervous, believing that they would not be able to explain things to the masses if they did not build tens of thousands of square meters of new dormitories; they even thought that problems would arise if the employees' demands were not met. One leader said, "If we don't build new dormitories, we will be making a mistake."
    Recently, the Party Committee of the First Automobile Works, in accordance with the spirit of "spending less money and accomplishing more" as instructed by the central government, investigated the housing shortage, organized a special committee, adjusted some unreasonable housing arrangements, renovated dilapidated houses, and repaired some temporary construction projects that had not been utilized in the past into dormitories, solving the housing needs of more than 1,100 employees. The housing problem has begun to ease, and the office of the property management department is much quieter. The number of people who came to make a scene and demand housing has begun to decrease. The clamor of phone calls questioning "Why don't you give me a house?" has also gradually disappeared.
    However, to completely solve the housing problem of the First Automobile Works, much work still needs to be done. In particular, it is necessary to strengthen ideological education for employees and help them correctly view the housing problem. Many employees are still complaining: "I initially thought that the automobile factory was large in scale and had many houses, and that each family could live in a suite, with heating, gas stoves, and separate toilets and kitchens. Who would have thought that we are still living in old bungalows?" Some employees transferred from the south also feel: Who in the automobile factory can be without a family dormitory? They brought their parents, wives, children, and even their brothers-in-law and mothers-in-law to live with them. Some employees whose families live in rural areas want their parents to abandon agricultural production, sell their livestock, and move in with them. Many employees whose families live in neighboring cities and counties are still planning to bring their families. A few workers who have houses in Changchun are preparing to give up their houses and ask the factory to allocate houses to them. The long-standing debate over "standard dormitories versus non-standard dormitories" has not yet stopped. Standard dormitories are all near the factory area, with beautiful rooms, heating, gas stoves, and separate toilets and kitchens. Everyone is vying for these standard dormitories. One female worker was very annoyed that she was not assigned a standard dormitory. One day at work, she threw her child onto the desk of the workshop director and said angrily, "If you don't give me a standard dormitory, and my child freezes, are you responsible?" Worker Zhang Jinsheng was unable to move into a standard dormitory and told the chairman of the labor union, "If you don't give me a standard dormitory, I won't go to work." He indeed did not go to work for one day. A small number of workers do not listen to reasonable arrangements, privately occupy standard dormitories, and still think they are very clever.
    These examples show that many employees do not correctly understand the housing difficulties and overestimate their personal needs. This is because the political and ideological education work in the automobile factory is not yet thorough, failing to make the masses correctly understand the relationship between the individual and the country, and between immediate needs and long-term interests. At the same time, when solving the factory's housing problem, it has not been clarified whether it is possible to allow all employees with families to live in family dormitories for a considerable period of time. For a large factory like the First Automobile Works, with more than 18,000 employees, it is both impossible and unreasonable to bring all the family members to the factory. Many employees' families live in the northeast region or in neighboring cities and counties, so why must they move into the factory? Although some employees' families live in the south, they want to bring their entire family, even their relatives. Is that necessary? In the old society, who could live in several rooms and bring all their family members, including brothers-in-law and mothers-in-law? Only landlords, bureaucrats, and capitalists. Now that the people are in charge, our country is still very poor and does not have a lot of money to build a large number of new dormitories. It is impossible for employees to bring all their family members with them.
    In addition, the more than 200,000 square meters of standard dormitories that have already been built at the First Automobile Works are too good and exceed the current standard of living. These dormitories with excessively high standards and waste of funds should no longer be built. The vast majority of factories in our country do not have such good dormitories, and urban residents and the vast number of peasants live in old bungalows and simple thatched or earthen houses. Why are there still employees at the First Automobile Works vying to live in these standard dormitories, and even hoping to build more of these standard dormitories? On the one hand, it is because the factory lacks political and ideological education for these employees. On the other hand, it is because the rent for standard dormitories is low and the conditions are good, which is much more cost-effective than living in non-standard dormitories.
    To solve the housing problem, leaders also need to truly overcome bureaucratic work styles and share weal and woe with the masses. At present, a small number of leaders in the automobile factory still live in too many houses and have not consciously given up their surplus dormitories. The masses are dissatisfied with this situation. They say, "Some leading cadres educate us to be diligent and thrifty all day long, but they themselves are not diligent and thrifty." Wen Hengde, the director of the Property Management Office and a labor model, said it well: "If you are a leader and you have too much housing, and you want to persuade the masses to want less housing, can you persuade them?"

    光靠给不能解决问题
          本报记者　陈迹
    房子问题一直是第一汽车厂很难解决的问题。几年来，新建和租用的宿舍已达四十几万平方公尺，但是仍然不能满足职工的要求。工厂投入生产以后，大约有两千二百多户职工申请要家属宿舍。这些要房子的职工，大体有这样几种情况：（一）从外地调来的职工要把家属接来，要宿舍。在两千二百多户职工中，这种情况就有一千五百多户。（二）青年职工要结婚，要单独的宿舍。（三）有些职工因为人口增多，要添房子。（四）有些工程师和技术员觉得房子挤，要增加房子。（五）住在市内或者住在由暂设工程改成的宿舍里的职工，觉得上下班不方便，或者嫌房子破旧，要求搬进厂区附近的标准宿舍。这些要求是不是合理，是不是能够办到，过去工厂领导上没有具体的分析，也没有认真的审查。有个时期，要房子的人竟多达五、六千人。当时，有些领导人员紧张得不得了，认为不新建十几万平方公尺的宿舍，不好向群众交代；甚至认为如果不满足职工的要求，就会出乱子。有个领导人说：“不盖新宿舍，我们就要犯错误。”
    最近，第一汽车厂党委会根据中央指示的“少花钱，多办事”的精神，调查了缺房的情况，组织了专门的委员会，调整了一些不合理的住房，整修了破烂的房屋，一些过去未能利用的暂设工程也补修成宿舍，解决了一千一百多户职工要的房屋。房子问题已经开始缓和下来，房产管理处的办公室清静得多了。跑来大吵大闹硬要房子的人，开始减少。打电话责问“为什么不给我房子”的嘈杂声，也渐渐消失。
    但是，要完全解决第一汽车厂的房子问题，还需要做不少工作。特别是要加强对职工的思想教育，帮助职工正确地看待房子问题。现在不少职工还在抱怨：“我起先以为汽车厂规模大，房子多，每户人家都能住上一套间，有暖气，有煤气炉，又有单独的厕所和厨房。谁想到如今还住着旧平房呢？”有些从南方调来的职工还觉得：在汽车厂那个人能没有家属宿舍？他们把父母妻儿以至小舅子丈母娘都接来同住。一些家住在农村的职工要他们的父母放弃农业生产，卖掉牲畜，迁来同住。不少家在邻近市、县的职工，还在打算接家属来。个别在长春有房子住的工人，准备把自己住房让出去，要求工厂分给房子。长期存在的所谓“标准宿舍与非标准宿舍”的争论，还未停止。标准宿舍都在厂区附近，房间漂亮，都有暖气、煤气炉和单独的厕所、厨房。大家争着要这种标准宿舍。有个女工没分到标准宿舍，很恼火，有一天上班，竟把自己的孩子向车间主任的办公桌上一扔，气冲冲地说：“不给我标准宿舍，我的孩子冻坏了，你负责吗？”工人张金生没能住进标准宿舍，找工会主席说：“不给标准宿舍，我就不上班。”他果真有一天没有上班。少数工人不听从合理的调配，私自霸占标准宿舍，还觉得自己很有办法。
    这些例子说明不少职工还没有正确了解住房的困难，过高地考虑个人的需要。这是因为汽车厂的政治思想教育工作还不深入，没有使得群众正确理解个人与国家、眼前需要与长远利益之间的关系。同时，在解决工厂住房问题的时候，还没有搞清楚这样一个重要的问题，就是在一个相当长的时期内，能不能让所有有家属的职工都能住上家属宿舍？像第一汽车厂这样大的工厂，有一万八千多职工，要想都把家属接来工厂，是既不可能，又不合理的。不少职工家庭住在东北境内，或者住在邻近市、县，为什么一定要搬进工厂呢？有些职工家庭虽然居住在南方，但是却想把全家都接来，甚至把亲戚也接来，难道又是必要的么？在旧社会里，哪些人能住上几间房子，把全家老少以至小舅子丈母娘都带在身边呢？不外是些地主、官僚和资本家。现在虽然是人民当了家，但是，我们的国家还很穷，没有很多的钱来修大量的新宿舍，不可能让职工都把家属带到身边。
    此外，第一汽车厂已经建成的二十几万平方公尺的标准宿舍，是太好了，是超过目前生活水平的。这种标准过高、浪费资金的宿舍，不能再建设了。我国绝大多数工厂都还没有这样好的宿舍，城市居民和广大农民住的都是古旧平房和简陋的草房、土房。第一汽车厂为什么还有职工争着要住这种标准宿舍，甚至还希望再新建这种标准宿舍呢？这一方面是因为工厂对于这些职工缺少政治思想教育，另方面是因为标准宿舍房租较低，条件又好，比住非标准宿舍合算得多。
    要解决房子问题，还需要领导人员真正克服官僚主义作风，和群众同甘共苦。现在汽车厂少数领导人员住的房子还过多，还没有自觉地把多余的宿舍让出来。群众对这种状况是不满意的。他们说：“有些领导干部整天教育我们要艰苦朴素，但是他们自己却不艰苦朴素。”房产管理处劳动模范温恒德处长说得好：“你是领导人，你住房太多，又想说服群众少要房子，你说服得了吗？”
