Big Truths in Small Matters
Chongwen District, Beijing, Gains Universally Meaningful Experience in Handling a Minor Dispute

Editor's Note: The dispute in the Chongwen District Seventh Metal Products Production Cooperative is a very small one. However, the principles they used to correctly handle this dispute apply to all large industrial enterprises, large agricultural cooperatives, large institutions, and schools.

Our correspondent Lü Jianzhong reports: On April 1st, the deputy director and Party branch secretary of the Chongwen District Seventh Metal Products Production Cooperative in Beijing hurried to the Industrial Department of the District Committee, saying that the twenty-eight members of the pickaxe team were angry, had left the workshop, and refused to work. This was caused by the cooperative's rigid announcement of new production quotas.

Only Distinguishing Between Right and Wrong of the Masses
Without Distinguishing Between Right and Wrong of the Leadership

Since the comrades of the Chongwen District Committee conveyed and studied Chairman Mao's report on the correct handling of contradictions among the people from top to bottom, they have taken a series of measures to expand democratic life and overcome bureaucratic ideologies and work styles. However, when encountering specific problems, how to implement the spirit of Chairman Mao's report to handle them was still a new lesson for them. Therefore, at the beginning, they did not find the correct approach, but came up with some wrong ideas that did not trust or rely on the masses. Some comrades in the Industrial Department of the District Committee suggested, "Go back and hold a members' meeting first, give a speech, and let the members of the pickaxe team admit their mistakes and resume work immediately." The deputy director and branch secretary of the Seventh Metal Products Production Cooperative felt that if they immediately convened a meeting of members, it would give them the wrong impression: as if the leading cadres were begging them, and the problem would be even more difficult to solve. The responsible comrade of the Industrial Department even supported this erroneous view. In the end, it was decided to temporarily ignore them and first try to understand their thinking from behind the scenes, or first organize them to visit other cooperatives to enlighten them and slowly realize their mistakes. These various ideas obviously made one mistake: only distinguishing between the right and wrong of the masses, without distinguishing between the right and wrong of the leadership; that is, only seeing the mistakes of the masses, wanting the masses to admit their mistakes, without seeing the mistakes of the leaders themselves, let alone admitting their own mistakes to the masses. So, did the leadership have any responsibility? Were the demands of the masses reasonable? Let's look at the facts. This cooperative's pickaxe team had five people per furnace, and the quota was to make fifteen pickaxes per day, but the actual output averaged 23.7. The cooperative's leadership, without consulting the members, rigidly increased the quota to twenty, so the members, in a fit of anger, all left the workshop. Not to mention that the cadres did not do ideological and political work and the leadership style was undemocratic. Even in the revision of the quota itself, the vital interests of the members were obviously ignored. Increasing the quota to twenty was not considered high from the existing actual output. However, in the past, the members had worked desperately to break the quota, the intensity of labor was very high, and the cooperative did not provide sick leave compensation when they got sick. In addition, the basic wage was 2.4 yuan per person per day, but in the past, the cooperative only paid 2.3 yuan. The cadres did not see the concerns and dissatisfaction that these unreasonable phenomena brought to the members, and naturally did not understand the reasons why the members were unwilling to increase the production quota. Even when the members waited anxiously for two days and took the initiative to consult with the cadres about resuming work, the cadres coldly replied, "Go back and think about it carefully."

The Key Lies in Daring to Admit Mistakes

After Comrade Lü Lianying, the secretary of the District Committee, learned about this incident, she convened a meeting of the cadres handling the incident on the afternoon of April 3rd and criticized their approach. And in connection with this specific event, she studied Chairman Mao's report and the central instructions, and everyone realized that they were verbally opposed to bureaucracy, but were bound by bureaucratic thinking when encountering specific problems, and verbally said that this was a contradiction among the people, but adopted an approach that was opposed to the masses. So, they went back that day and examined the leadership's mistakes to the members. At the same time, they also pointed out to the members that after cooperativization, the nature of the enterprise had changed, and the masses were the masters of the cooperative. Strikes and cessation of production were detrimental to the country and to the members themselves. Therefore, they should immediately resume work and discuss and resolve the quota issue together. The members happily resumed work.

The Masses Demonstrated an Attitude of Ownership

The handling of this incident educated and improved the cadres, and also educated and improved the masses. When the cadres first distinguished between right and wrong and examined the leadership's mistakes to the masses, the masses did not excessively blame the leaders, but sincerely offered suggestions to the leaders for improving their work. After resolving the members' sick leave compensation and appropriately improving working conditions, the members immediately agreed to increase the quota to twenty. At the same time, they also regretted that it was wrong to adopt the method of strikes. Therefore, they expressed their attitude of ownership in the same thing that happened immediately afterwards: the new quota had just been set, and the higher-ups changed it to equipping the pickaxe team with another kind of rougher raw material. This raw material was time-consuming and labor-intensive, and the quota needed to be appropriately reduced. In the past, this change of quota would inevitably involve bargaining and a lot of trouble, but this time, the cadres sincerely consulted with the members, and the members realistically proposed to change the quota to eighteen, and this quota number was exactly what the cadres had originally planned to propose.

Big Truths in Small Matters

This attitude of the members deeply moved branch secretary Lin Benhou. In the past, none of the members of the pickaxe team were willing to tell him the truth. He was troubled in his heart, but could not find the reason. Now he felt how much harm his past practice of only knowing how to lecture the members and the view that "the masses are backward, and they must be suppressed" had brought to the work and to the relationship between the leaders and the masses! The handling of this incident made him understand an important point in correctly handling contradictions among the people, which is to trust the masses and rely on the masses, that is, to be among the masses, and not to stand above the masses and be opposed to the masses.

This cooperative in Chongwen District is a very small enterprise, and this dispute is a very small dispute. However, the principles of correctly handling this kind of dispute apply to all large industrial enterprises, large agricultural cooperatives, large institutions, and schools.

Similar events had happened more than once in Chongwen District after the realization of the socialist transformation of handicrafts, and in the past, they were not handled properly. This time, after the District Committee studied the issue of correctly handling contradictions among the people, it found the correct method. The comrades of the District Committee recognized the importance of ideological and political work, but they were worried that they did not have teaching materials and lacked methods. But in fact, this difficulty is not difficult to overcome. Not to mention anything else, summarizing what you have learned and done and teaching it to Party members and the masses is not also the most practical and vivid ideological and political teaching material?

    小问题里面有大道理
    北京市崇文区处理一件小纠纷，取得了有普遍意义的经验
    编者按：崇文区第七金属品生产合作社的纠纷，是一场很小的纠纷。但是他们正确处理这种纠纷的原则，却适用于一切大的工业企业、大的农业社，大的机关和学校。本报记者　吕建中报道　4月1日，北京市崇文区第七金属品生产合作社的副主任和党支部书记匆匆来到区委会工业部，说，洋镐组的二十八个社员生了气，离开了车间，不干活了。这是社里硬性公布了新的生产定额而引起的。
    只分清群众的是非
    没有分清领导的是非
    崇文区委会的同志们自从从上到下传达学习了毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的报告以后，采取了一系列的措施，扩大民主生活，克服官僚主义思想作风；但是在碰到具体问题的时候，怎样贯彻毛主席报告的精神来处理，这对他们还是新的一课。因此一开始他们没有找到正确的处理方法，却想出了一些不相信群众、不依靠群众的错主意。区委工业部有的同志主张，回去先开个社员会，讲一讲话，让洋镐组的社员承认错误，立刻复工。第七金属品生产合作社的副主任和支部书记觉得，如果现在马上去召集社员开会，会给他们造成一个错觉：好像领导干部去向他们求情了，问题反而更不好解决。工业部的负责同志竟支持了这个错误观点。最后决定暂时不理他们，而先从背后去摸思想情况，或者先组织他们到别的社去参观，使他们得到启发，慢慢地认识错误。这种种想法显然犯了一个毛病：只分清群众的是非，没有分清领导上的是非；也就是说，只看到群众的错误，要群众承认错误，没有看到领导者自己的错误，更不向群众承认自己的错误。那么，究竟领导上有没有责任呢？群众的要求合理不合理呢？我们看一看事实吧。这个社洋镐组每盘炉五个人，定额是每天做洋镐十五个，实际产量却平均达到了23.7个。社的领导上没有同社员商量，就硬把定额提高到二十个，于是社员们一气，都离开了车间。干部不做思想政治工作，领导作风不民主，这且不说。就是在修改定额本身，也显然忽视了社员的切身利益。定额提高到二十个，这从已有的实际产量来看并不算高。但是，社员们过去为了突破定额，拚命地干，劳动强度很高，生了病社里也没有病假补助。另外，每人每天基本工资是二元四角，过去社里却按二元三角发给。干部看不见这些不合理的现象给社员带来的顾虑和不满，也自然就不了解社员不愿意提高生产定额的原因了。甚至当社员们焦急地等了两天，主动和干部商量复工的时候，干部仍然冷冷地回答说：“您们回去好好想想再说吧。”
    关键在于勇于承认错误
    区委书记吕连英同志知道这件事情以后，便在4月3日下午召集处理这个事件的干部开会，对他们这种处理方法提出了批评。并且又结合这个具体事件，学习了毛主席的报告和中央的指示，大家这才觉察到自己口说反对官僚主义，而碰到具体问题却被官僚主义思想所缚，口说这是人民内部矛盾，而采用的却是与群众相对立的处理方法。于是当天回去便向社员们检讨了领导上的错处。同时还向社员指出，合作化以后，企业的性质变了，群众是合作社的主人了，罢工，停止生产，对国家不利，对社员自己也不利。因此应该立即复工，大家共同来讨论和解决定额问题，社员们欣然复工了。
    群众表现了主人翁态度
    对这个事件的处理，教育提高了干部，也教育提高了群众。当干部首先自己分清是非，向群众检查了领导错误的时候，群众并没有过多地去责备领导，而是诚恳地向领导提出改进工作的意见。在解决了社员病假补助，适当地改善劳动条件以后，社员们立刻就同意把定额提高到二十个。同时也悔悟自己采用罢工办法是不应该的。因此，他们就在紧接着发生的同一件事情上来表示自己的主人翁态度：新定额刚刚定下来，上边又改变为配备给洋镐组另一种较粗糙的原料，这种原料费工费时，定额也就需要适当降低。要是在过去，这种改变定额少不了又要讨价还价，费一番周折，而这次，干部诚心诚意地和社员商量，社员也实事求是地提出把定额改为十八个，而这个定额数字正是干部原来准备提出的。
    小问题里面的大道理
    社员这种态度使支部书记林本厚深深受到感动。过去洋镐组的社员没有一人肯对他说真心话，他内心苦恼，却找不出原因来；现在他才感到自己过去那种光知道向社员训话的做法和“群众落后，不压不行”的观点，对工作，对领导和群众的关系带来多大危害！对这个事件的处理使他懂得了正确处理人民内部矛盾的重要一条，就是要相信群众，依靠群众，就是要置身于群众之中，而不要站在群众之上，和群众对立起来。
    崇文区这个合作社是一个很小的企业，这一场纠纷是一场很小的纠纷。但是正确处理这种纠纷的原则，却适用于一切大的工业企业、大的农业社、大的机关和学校。
    类似这样的事件，崇文区手工业实现社会主义改造后曾发生过不止一次，过去都处理得不够妥当。这次区委学习了正确处理人民内部矛盾问题以后，才找到正确的办法。区委的同志认识了思想政治工作的重要，不过他们在发愁没有教材，缺少办法。但是实际上这个困难是不难克服的。别的且不说，把自己这些学过和做过的事总结起来，教给党员和群众，不也就是一种最实际最生动的思想政治教材吗？
