Xinhua News Agency, May 13th: Mayor of Beijing Peng Zhen held a banquet this afternoon to bid farewell to the entire Romanian Grand National Assembly and Bucharest City People's Council delegation led by Constantin Pârvulescu. The delegation has completed a half-month friendly visit to various parts of China and will leave Beijing tomorrow morning to return home.

Mayor Peng Zhen delivered a speech at the banquet, expressing his gratitude on behalf of the people of Beijing and the entire Chinese people for the delegation's visit to China. He said that the envoys of the Romanian people have brought the brotherly friendship of the Romanian people to the Chinese people. He also said that Romania is a fraternal country in the socialist family headed by the Soviet Union, and the great achievements of the Romanian people not only strengthen the power of the entire socialist camp, but also make a significant contribution to maintaining world peace and developing the cause of human progress. Mayor Peng Zhen also mentioned that during his visit to Romania, he saw that in a factory of 9,000 people, there were only six full-time Party workers and only eight full-time trade union cadres. He said that the Romanian comrades' way of running enterprises is worth learning from. He also expressed gratitude to the Romanian government and people for the technical equipment assistance Romania has provided to China's construction efforts.

Chairman Pârvulescu said at the banquet: Tomorrow morning, our delegation will leave China, but the sights and experiences we have had here will remain in our minds forever. After returning home, we will introduce to our people the achievements of the new Chinese people in socialist construction, and the determination and enthusiasm of the Chinese people to strive for victory in their own cause and for the victory of peace. Chairman Pârvulescu said, I want to emphasize once again that the mutual visits of our two countries' parliamentary delegations fully demonstrate that this is a very good opportunity to enhance mutual understanding. Through this kind of visit, we can exchange experiences in peaceful construction and strengthen the friendship between the Chinese and Romanian people within the camp of peace and socialism. He also said that such mutual visits by parliamentary delegations should be promoted with all countries, regardless of their social and national systems.

Those present at the banquet included Li Jishen, Shen Junru, and Chen Shutong, Vice-Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress; Xi Zhongxun, Secretary-General of the State Council; members of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress in Beijing; and responsible persons of the Beijing Municipal People's Committee.

Xinhua News Agency, May 13th: Peng Zhen, Vice-Chairman and Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, today afternoon held a discussion with Constantin Pârvulescu, Chairman of the Romanian Grand National Assembly, and A. Hîncu, Secretary of the Presidium, on issues related to the work of the parliaments of China and Romania.

Chairman Constantin Pârvulescu introduced the past work of the Romanian Grand National Assembly, the work of the Presidium of the Grand National Assembly, the new decisions recently made by the Grand National Assembly on improving parliamentary work, and the contact between deputies and voters.

Vice-Chairman Peng Zhen introduced China's state system and the work of the National People's Congress.

When talking about the convening of the National People's Congress meetings, Peng Zhen focused on introducing the consultation work before, during, and after the meetings. He said that this can more fully promote democracy, so that everyone has the opportunity to fully express their opinions. Therefore, it is easier to reach a consensus during the discussions at the congress.

Peng Zhen also mentioned that when the National People's Congress decides on certain major measures, it first submits them to the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference for discussion. He said that there, we can often hear some beneficial criticisms and suggestions that are not easily heard within the Party and the government.

Peng Zhen introduced to the guests that recently we are preparing to study strengthening the supervision of the government's work by the National People's Congress, and plan to take some necessary measures, such as establishing institutions to supervise the government's work, setting up supervisory bodies in local people's congresses at all levels, etc., to combat bureaucracy.

The guests expressed interest in some of the measures taken by the Chinese parliament.

A. Hîncu also asked about the inspection system for people's representatives and CPPCC members. Peng Zhen said that this is an effective measure we have taken to supervise the government, combat bureaucracy, and strengthen ties with the masses and with reality.

During the talks, both the hosts and guests believed that the recent mutual visits of the parliamentary delegations of China and Romania have led to a further understanding of each other's parliamentary work and are conducive to mutual learning and exchange of experiences.

Also participating in the discussion were Zhang Su, Wu Xinyu, and Zhang Youyu.
