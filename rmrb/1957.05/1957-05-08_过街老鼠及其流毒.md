A Rat Running Across the Street and Its Pernicious Influence
    Liu Zhongping

    The "Red Flag" newspaper reported on April 22nd that the U.S. Embassy in Japan investigated the economic income and expenditure of organizations such as the Japanese Communist Party, the Japan-China Friendship Association, the Japan-Soviet Friendship Association, and the Japan Peace Committee. It published the results to journalists, saying that last year Japan's "red-related operating expenses" amounted to 7.2 billion yen.
    This news was mentioned by Fujii, Director-General of the Public Security Investigation Agency of Japan, in his speech at the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee on the 19th. He also openly stated that investigating mass organizations related to the Communist Party is legal, and that he would also investigate the actions of Communist Party members of the Diet. He based this on an Associated Press news item published in the English-language newspaper "Japan Times" on February 28: "The Communist Party spent 20 million U.S. dollars on propaganda in Japan last year." This was announced in Tokyo by a U.S. Embassy spokesperson to thirty-three American newspaper and radio reporters on a Far East trip. At the same time, many "experts" in charge of politics, economy, military affairs, and intelligence also spoke, but they were unwilling to reveal their names.
    It cannot be said that these "experts," who, like masked robbers in medieval Europe, are unwilling to reveal their names, are speaking irresponsibly. Their words were obviously issued for a purpose, to be heard by Japanese officials. The speech by the Director-General of the Public Security Investigation Agency, as one of the responsible officials of the Japanese government, at the Foreign Affairs Committee proves that their words have had an effect.
    However, their words are a complete fabrication. The First Secretary of the Japanese Communist Party, Nosaka, issued a statement the same day, pointing out: "The information disseminated by the U.S. Embassy is completely unfounded and completely fabricated. The Japanese Communist Party's funding is certainly not as large as stated. Moreover, the details of expenditures have been reported one by one according to the 'Political Funds Control Law.' This kind of rumor-mongering propaganda is the same trick as McCarthyism, which drove Canadian Ambassador Norman to the point of suicide."
    Yes, although McCarthy himself has died, his evil wind still exists and has blown to Japan. Investigating the financial situation of the Japanese Communist Party and other Japanese people's organizations is undoubtedly a prelude to undermining Japan's democratic forces. During the rule of "His Majesty MacArthur," the American occupation authorities once ordered a "purge" of the Japanese Communist Party, followed by a series of attacks on Japan's democratic forces. But that was in 1950, when the Americans had power in their hands during the occupation, while now it is 1957, five years after Japan's "independence." A few days ago, "His Majesty MacArthur's" nephew, the newly appointed U.S. Ambassador to Japan, MacArthur II, hypocritically said that a "new era" in Japan-U.S. relations was "beginning," and that the relationship between the two countries was "a completely peaceful and equal partnership." The U.S. Embassy makes no secret of its investigative and probing activities in Japan, and makes no secret of its blatant interference in Japan's internal affairs. If this does not show that MacArthur II's sweet talk is only intended to deceive fools, then it shows that the U.S. Embassy still considers itself the headquarters of "His Majesty MacArthur."
    America's McCarthyite "persecution maniacs," after the Norman incident, have once again become rats running across the street, condemned by public opinion in various countries, including Japan. In the eyes of McCarthyites, maintaining peace, hoping for Japan-China friendship, and demanding Japan-Soviet amity should be "investigated," which is not surprising. What is strange is the attitude of Japanese officials. Even if the Japanese government only wants to maintain a semblance of "independence," it should express some objection to the U.S. Embassy's blatant interference in internal affairs, an unauthorized intrusion. However, from February 28 to the present, we have not heard the Japanese government raise any objections, although it did express some attitude towards the Toru incident. On the contrary, the role played by Fujii, Director-General of the Public Security Investigation Agency, at the Foreign Affairs Committee is entirely that of a "partner" of the rat running across the street. Please see the following dialogue:
    Okada Haruo (Socialist Party member of the Diet): It is very incomprehensible that foreign agencies are investigating the funding of legal organizations in Japan. Does the Public Security Investigation Agency believe that it is legally justifiable to investigate organizations other than the Communist Party?
    Fujii: Those suspected of being affiliated with the Communist Party will be investigated. (Note: The Japanese Anti-Subversive Activities Law stipulates that "necessary regulatory measures shall be taken against groups that engage in violent subversive activities through group activities," and stipulates that this law "shall not be arbitrarily expanded in interpretation." The Japanese Communist Party is a legal party engaged in legal activities, and according to this law, it is also not authorized to arbitrarily investigate the Japanese Communist Party.)
    Okada: It is illegal to make arbitrary judgments and conduct investigations.
    Fujii: The investigation is being conducted as an aspect of investigating the activities of the Communist Party. If there are Communist Party members in it, it is an organization affiliated with the Communist Party.
    Okada: Then, if there are Communist Party members in the trade union and Communist Party members in the Diet, are they all organizations affiliated with the Communist Party?
    Fujii: The Diet is not. Communist Party members in the Diet can be investigated for their actions depending on the circumstances, but the Diet will not be investigated. (Note: The Japanese Constitution stipulates that "freedom of thought and conscience shall not be violated." Arbitrarily investigating the activities of members of the Diet is a serious violation of the rights of members of the Diet.) Tanaka Otonosuke (Socialist Party member of the Diet): I am also a director of the Japan-China Friendship Association, as is Mr. Yamaguchi Kikuichirō of the Liberal Democratic Party. The Friendship Association is a non-partisan organization. On what legal basis are you investigating its funding as an aspect of Communist Party activities?
    Fujii: According to the Anti-Subversive Activities Law.
    Tanaka: Which part of the Japan-China Friendship Association's activities violates the Anti-Subversive Activities Law?
    Fujii: The relations between the Japan-China Friendship Association and the Soviet Union and China are also recorded in public materials. The investigation is based on this. (Okada: What do you mean by "public materials"?) The newspapers of the Chinese Communist Party have it. (Okada: The newspapers of the Chinese Communist Party also publish information about the Kishi Cabinet!) The economic income of the Japan-China Friendship Association and the Japan-Soviet Friendship Association is also published in public materials. These materials will be further investigated to determine the extent to which Communist Party activities have infiltrated. The Japan-China Friendship Association itself is not being investigated as an object of the Anti-Subversive Activities Law. If what I said earlier made you hear it that way, then I retract my original statement. (Okada: Didn't you just say it was an organization affiliated with the Communist Party? Didn't you say it was definitely like that?)
    I really want to see what kind of face Fujii has when making such a reply. Unfortunately, this Japanese newspaper did not publish a photo or any description. Regarding the persecution activities of McCarthyism, even the American "New York Post" said: "We should become more cautious and intelligent about their messianic activities, which rely on memories, gossip, and maliciously slanderous documents pieced together from truth and falsehood." Under these circumstances, in Japan, where the vast majority of the people unanimously demand peace and hope for Japan-China friendship, it is really difficult not to fall into an extremely embarrassing situation when one insists on being the tail of a rat running across the street!

    过街老鼠及其流毒
    刘仲平
    4月22日“赤旗报”载：美国驻日本大使馆曾调查日本共产党、日中友好协会、日苏亲善协会、日本和平委员会等团体的经济收支情况，并将调查结果公布给新闻记者，说去年日本的“赤化工作费”花了七十二亿日元。
    这个消息是日本公安调查厅长官藤井在19日众议院外交委员会上的发言中提到的。他还公然说：调查同共产党有关的群众团体是合法的，并且要调查共产党国会议员的行动。他所根据的是日本出版的一家英文报纸“日本时报”2月28日登载的美联社的一条消息：“共产党去年在日本用于宣传的费用达二千万美元”。这是美国大使馆发言人在东京向远东旅行中的三十三名美国报刊、广播记者发表的。同时，发言的还有许多主管政治、经济、军事、情报的“专家”，但他们都不愿意透露名字。
    不能说这些像欧洲中世纪的复面强盗似的不愿意透露名字的“专家”，说话是不负责任的。他们的话显然是有所为而发，是说给日本官员听的。作为日本政府负责官员之一的公安调查厅长官在外交委员会上的发言，证明他们的话是收到了效果的。
    然而他们的话却是漫天大谎。日共第一书记野坂当天即发表谈话，指出：“美国大使馆流布的情报，完全是无中生有，完全是捏造。日本共产党的经费，当然没有所说的那样大的数目。而且开支内容根据‘政治资金管理法’已一一呈报。这种造谣宣传，同麦卡锡主义迫使加拿大诺曼大使走头无路而终于自杀的伎俩是出于一途的。”
    是的，麦卡锡人虽一命呜呼，而邪风犹存，而且刮到日本来了。调查日共和其它日本人民团体的经费情况，无疑地是企图摧残日本民主力量的先声。在“麦帅陛下”统治期间，美国占领当局曾经下令“整肃”过日共，接着便展开了一系列对于日本民主力量的进攻。但那是1950年，是美国人大权在握的占领时候，而现在则是1957年，是日本“独立”了五年之后。前些日子，“麦帅陛下”的侄子，新任驻日大使的麦克阿瑟第二还伪善地说过：日美关系的“新时期正在开始”，两国关系是“一种完全的和平等的伙伴关系”。美国大使馆毫不掩饰它在日本的调查、刺探活动，毫不隐讳它对日本内政的露骨干涉，这如果不是说明麦克阿瑟第二的甜言蜜语只是想骗骗傻瓜，那就是说明美国大使馆今天仍然自居为“麦帅陛下”的总部。
    美国的麦卡锡“迫害狂”，在诺曼事件之后，重新成了过街老鼠，受到世界各国舆论，包括日本舆论的谴责。在麦卡锡分子看来，维护和平，希望日中友好，要求日苏亲善，就应该受到“调查”，这原不足怪。奇怪的是日本官员的态度。日本政府那怕只是为了维护一下“自主”的体面，对美国大使馆的这种无权插手而硬插进一只手来的极其露骨的干涉内政行为，似乎也应有所表示，但从2月28日到现在，我们却没有听到日本政府提出什么异议，虽然对于都留事件它倒多少表示了一下态度。相反的，公安调查厅长官藤井在外交委员会上扮演的角色，却完全是过街老鼠的“伙伴”的角色。请看下面的对话：
    冈田春夫（社会党议员）：外国机关调查日本的合法团体的经费，这是非常不可理解的。公安调查厅是否认为对于共产党以外的团体进行调查在法律上是说得通的呢？
    藤井：有共产党外围嫌疑的，就加以调查。（按：日本的防止破坏活动法规定“对以团体活动进行暴力破坏活动的团体，采取必要的管制措施”，并规定对于这个法律“不得任意加以扩大解释”。日共是进行合法活动的合法政党，根据这个法律，对于日共也是无权随意加以调查的。）
    冈田：你随便加以判断，进行调查是违法的。
    藤井：调查是作为调查共产党活动的一个方面来进行的。其中有共产党员，就是共产党外围团体。
    冈田：那末，工会里有共产党员，国会里也有共产党员，都是共产党外围团体吗？
    藤井：国会不是。国会里的共产党员，根据情况，可以调查他的行动，但不调查国会。（按：日本宪法规定：“不得侵犯思想和良心的自由”。随意调查议员的活动是对议员权利的严重侵犯。）田中织之助（社会党议员）：我也是日中友好协会的理事，自由民主党的山口喜久一郎先生也是。友协是超党派的组织，把它作为共产党活动的一个方面，调查其经费，是根据什么法律？
    藤井：根据防止破坏活动法。
    田中：日中友好协会的活动，哪一部分触犯了防止破坏活动法？
    藤井：日中友好协会和苏联、中共的关系，公开资料上也有记载。就根据这个进行调查。（冈田：“公开资料”指的是什么？）中共的报纸上就有。（冈田：中共的报纸上也登有岸内阁的事情呀！）日中友协、日苏亲善协会的经济收入，有的也发表在公开资料上，将进一步调查这些资料，查明共产党的活动究竟渗透到什么程度。并不是把日中友好协会本身当作防止破坏活动法的对象加以调查。如果方才说的，使你们听成那样，那末我取消原话。（冈田：方才你不说是共产党外围团体吗？不是说肯定是这样的吗？）
    真想看看进行这种答辩的藤井是一副什么嘴脸。可惜这张日本报纸上没有刊登照片，也没有作任何描写。关于麦卡锡主义的迫害活动，连美国本国的“纽约邮报”都说：对于他们“依靠回忆、闲话和恶意中伤拼凑起来的、真假混杂的文件所作的救世活动，应该变得小心一些和聪明一些了”。在这种情况下，在绝大部分人民一致要求和平，希望日中友好的日本，硬要作过街老鼠的尾巴，而想不使自己陷于极其难堪的境地，岂不难乎其为人哉！
