To Prevent Theft and Concealment, Achieve Quick Harvesting
Lixian County Promotes the "Four Guarantees" Method in Summer Harvest

    (Report from the Hebei Daily): According to the Hebei Daily, three members of the Chinese Communist Party Lixian County Committee and three members of the district committee, through summarizing the experiences and lessons of last year's summer harvest, explored a "Four Guarantees" method of group contracting for harvesting, threshing, labor, and output in six agricultural cooperatives, including Jingqiu, Zhengnanzhuang, and Zhangzhuang. This involves contracting a certain amount of wheat fields to groups for harvesting and threshing, based on work processes and contracted output (the team's contracted output), with rewards for exceeding the target and compensation for falling short. After discussion and座谈among cooperative cadres and members, it was unanimously agreed that this method has the following four advantages: 1. It can prevent and reduce theft, embezzlement, and concealment of output; 2. Command is flexible, there is no wasted time, and harvesting and threshing are quick; 3. Cooperative members have a strong sense of responsibility, management is good, and harvesting and threshing are clean; 4. Everything is clear and clean, cooperative members are happy, and cadres are relieved. Of the 104 production teams in these six cooperatives, 57 decided to adopt it.
    By May 16th, out of the 1,648 production teams in the county, 916 had already implemented this method, and the remaining teams were in the process of implementing it.

    防止盗窃隐瞒　做到快打快收
    蠡县在夏收中推行“四包”办法
    本报讯　据河北日报报道：中共河北蠡县县委的三个委员和三个区委委员，4月下旬分别在荆丘、正南庄、张庄等六个农业社，通过总结去年夏收的经验教训，摸索到了一条小组包收、包打、包工、包产的“四包”办法。就是把一定数量的麦田按照工序和包产产量（队的包产产量）分别包给小组收打，超产奖励，减产赔偿。这个办法，通过社干部、社员讨论和大家座谈，一致认为它有以下四个优点：一、能防止和减少偷窃、贪污和隐瞒产量；二、指挥灵便，不窝工，收打快；三、社员责任心强，管理的好，收打的净；四、清楚干净，社员痛快，干部省心。这六个社共一百零四个生产队，就有五十七个生产队决定采用。
    到5月16日，全县一千六百四十八个生产队，已有九百一十六个生产队推行了这个办法，其余队也正在推行。
