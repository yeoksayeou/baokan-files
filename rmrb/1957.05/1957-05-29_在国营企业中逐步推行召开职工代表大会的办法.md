    Method of Gradually Promoting the Convening of Workers' Representative Congresses in State-Owned Enterprises
    Today, this newspaper publishes the report of the Second Industrial Department of the CPC Shenyang Municipal Committee on the pilot work of convening workers' representative congresses in five state-owned factories. This report, together with the preliminary experiences gained in other pilot areas during this period, can illustrate that, under the correct leadership of the Party, the gradual promotion of the workers' representative congress system in state-owned industrial and transportation enterprises is a good way to expand internal democracy, resolve internal contradictions, and promote production. It is also a good way to help the Party, administrative, and trade union organizations in state-owned enterprises overcome bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism. We believe that, after gaining relatively mature experience in pilot projects, Party committees and people's committees in various regions can formulate plans and promote this method in batches based on the specific conditions of local state-owned industrial and transportation enterprises.
    As everyone knows, wholeheartedly relying on the working masses to run enterprises well has always been the working principle of our Party in state-owned enterprises. In the early days of national liberation, when many former bureaucratic capital enterprises were transformed into state-owned enterprises under the ownership of the whole people, workers' representative conferences were established in the enterprises as a form of organization to absorb the broad masses of workers to participate in the management of the enterprises. This form of organization played a significant role in carrying out democratic reform and production reform in enterprises, and in restoring and developing production. However, later on, especially since the implementation of the "one-chief system" in many state-owned industrial and transportation enterprises in 1953, the workers' representative conferences became meetings where enterprise leaders simply assigned tasks and the working masses made pledges. Enterprise leaders rarely engaged in self-criticism at such meetings, and even less attention was paid to mobilizing the masses to carry out criticism from below. This was obviously inappropriate. Last September, after the Eighth National Congress of the Party decided to implement the system of factory director responsibility under the collective leadership of the Party committee and the leadership method of the mass line in state-owned enterprises, various regions, on the one hand, implemented the system of factory director responsibility under the leadership of the Party committee in state-owned enterprises, and on the other hand, also began to tentatively change the original workers' representative conferences, presided over by the trade union, into workers' representative congresses in a small number of state-owned industrial and transportation enterprises, appropriately expanding their powers and gradually making them a system. This experiment is of great significance for expanding democratic management in state-owned enterprises and implementing the working method of the mass line.
    What kind of institution should the workers' representative congress be? The experience of various pilot areas shows that the workers' representative congress should be an institution for workers in state-owned enterprises to participate in enterprise management and to supervise the administrative leadership of the enterprise. The workers' representative congress adopts a system of permanent representatives. The representatives are directly elected by the working masses, are responsible to the workers who elected them, and the working masses have the right to remove unqualified representatives at any time. The workers' representative congress has the right to listen to and discuss the factory director's work report, review and discuss the enterprise's production plan, financial plan, technical plan, labor and wage plan, and important measures to achieve these plans, periodically check the implementation of the plan, and make suggestions. The workers' representative congress also has the right to review and discuss the enterprise's bonus fund, welfare expenses, medical expenses, labor protection appropriations, trade union funds, and other expenses related to the life and welfare of the workers; without violating the instructions and orders of higher authorities, it can make resolutions on the above-mentioned scope and submit them to the enterprise's administrative department or other relevant parties for implementation. Since state-owned enterprises are enterprises owned by the whole people, rather than enterprises collectively owned by the enterprise's workers, the administrative leaders of the enterprise should, of course, be appointed by the state management organs representing the interests of the whole people, rather than elected by the workers' representative congress. However, if the administrative leaders of the enterprise are unqualified, the workers' representative congress not only has the right to criticize them, but also can, when necessary, suggest to the higher management organs that they be removed from their posts. The workers' representative congress also has the right to make suggestions to higher authorities when it has different opinions on the decisions of higher management organs. However, if the higher management organs, after research, still insist on the original decision, then it must be implemented. All of these are in line with the unshakable basic principle of democratic centralism, that is, centralization on the basis of democracy and democracy under the guidance of centralization.
    Another important experience of the pilot project is that the workers' representative congress established in state-owned industrial and transportation enterprises and the trade union member representative congress should be a single organization. It does not need and should not abandon the trade union and "start a new stove." The trade union committee must not only be responsible for preparing and convening the workers' representative congress, but also be responsible for supervising the administrative leadership's implementation of the workers' representative congress's resolutions on production and administrative work during the recess of the workers' representative congress. At the next workers' representative congress, the trade union committee will report on the implementation of the supervision resolutions. This will strengthen and fully develop the role of the trade union organization. If the workers' representative congress and the trade union member representative congress are divided into two sets of institutions, not only will the number of representative congresses increase, wasting the time and energy of the workers, but also the overlapping of institutions will inevitably lead to many repetitions of content and unclear responsibilities when holding meetings and handling affairs after the meetings, thus inevitably reducing work efficiency and weakening the role of the trade union organization.
    To enable the workers' representative congress system in state-owned enterprises to be established and promoted in a healthy manner, the correct leadership of the enterprise's Party committee plays a decisive role. According to the experience of various pilot areas, the enterprise's Party committee must correctly handle the relationship between the overall and long-term interests of the people of the whole country and the partial and temporary interests of the workers in the unit on every specific issue; it must correctly regulate the relationship between the administrative leadership of the enterprise and the trade union organization and the working masses. The Party committee should not make rigid decisions on the topics of the workers' representative congress in advance, so that the meeting can freely express the will of the working masses; however, the Party committee must have clear guidelines for the major issues discussed in the meeting, and strengthen the ideological leadership of the meeting through the active activities of Party members, and strive to prevent the meeting from making wrong and unenforceable decisions. At the workers' representative congress, even if the opinions of the workers' representatives are wrong, they should be allowed to express them freely, and no rules and regulations should be set to restrict the democratic rights of the masses. Of course, it is necessary to persuade those who hold wrong opinions, but it must be noted that the enthusiasm of the working masses should never be hindered. When the workers' representatives correctly criticize the bureaucratic errors of the administrative leadership at the meeting, the Party committee should not only not defend them, but should also enthusiastically support this beneficial criticism and rely on the strength of the masses to overcome the bureaucratic shortcomings in the administrative leadership. The Party committee should also lead the enterprise's administrative department to actively implement the resolutions of the workers' representative congress.
    No matter how much the degree of democracy in factory management is expanded, in our country, the command of enterprise production management must be the full responsibility of the administrative leader. Therefore, the Party committee needs to strengthen political and ideological work among the workers, so that the workers' representative congress and the trade union committee must not hinder the factory director's responsibility system in the administrative affairs of the enterprise in their work. The Party committee and the trade union need to educate all workers to abide by the enterprise's rules and regulations and labor discipline, and to obey the orders and commands of the administrative leaders. Only in this way can we achieve the goal of mobilizing all positive factors in the enterprise to do a good job in production and comprehensively and over-fulfill the state plan.
    From the recent preliminary summary of the pilot work of convening workers' representative congresses in various places, we believe that some of the above views can be put forward. Although the preliminary experience of convening workers' representative congresses is generally successful and feasible, it is obviously not yet mature. We hope that the Party committees and people's committees in various regions will instruct the industrial and transportation enterprise departments under their jurisdiction to continue to summarize the experience of the pilot implementation of the workers' representative congress method, so as to make this experience more perfect and promote it in batches in state-owned enterprises in various places.

### 在国营企业中逐步推行召开职工代表大会的办法

    在国营企业中逐步推行召开职工代表大会的办法
    本报今天发表了中共沈阳市委第二工业部关于在五个国营工厂中召开职工代表大会的试点工作的报告。这个报告和这个时期其他各地在试点工作中所取得的初步经验可以说明：在党的正确领导下，在国营工业交通企业中逐步推行职工代表大会制，是扩大企业内部民主、解决企业内部矛盾、推进生产的一种好方式，也是帮助国营企业中的党、行政和工会组织克服官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义的一种好方式。我们认为，各地党委和人民委员会，在试点取得比较成熟的经验以后，可以根据当地国营工业交通企业的具体情况，订出计划，分批地推行这个办法。
    大家知道，全心全意地依靠职工群众办好企业，从来是我们党在国营企业中工作的方针。在全国解放之初，当许多原来的官僚资本企业被改变为全民所有制的国营企业以后，就在企业中建立了职工代表会议，作为吸收广大职工群众参加企业的管理工作的一种组织形式。这种组织形式，对于进行企业的民主改革和生产改革，对于恢复和发展生产，起了重大的作用。但是在后来，特别是从1953年在许多国营工业交通企业中推行“一长制”以来，职工代表会议就变成单纯地由企业领导者布置任务、职工群众提出保证的会议了，企业领导者很少在这样的会议上进行自我批评，更不注意发动群众开展自下而上的批评。这显然是不适当的。去年9月，党的八次大会决定要在国营企业中贯彻执行党委集体领导下的厂长负责制和群众路线的领导方法以后，各地一方面在国营企业中执行党委领导下的厂长负责制，另一方面也开始在少数国营工业交通企业中，将原有的由工会主持的职工代表会议试改为职工代表大会，适当扩大权限，并使之逐步成为一种制度。这种试验对于扩大国营企业中的民主管理，贯彻执行群众路线的工作方法，是有重要意义的。
    职工代表大会应该是一个甚么性质的机构呢？各地进行试点工作的经验表明，职工代表大会应该是国营企业的职工参加企业管理和对企业行政领导进行群众监督的机构。职工代表大会采取常任代表制，代表由职工群众直接选举，代表向选举他们的职工负责，职工群众有权随时撤换不称职的代表。职工代表大会有权听取和讨论厂长的工作报告，审查和讨论企业的生产计划、财务计划、技术计划、劳动工资计划和实现这些计划的重要措施，定期地检查计划执行情况，并且提出建议。职工代表大会还有权审查和讨论企业奖励基金、福利费、医药费、劳动保护拨款、工会经费以及其他有关职工生活福利的经费开支；在不违反上级机关的指示、命令的条件下，可以就上述范围作出决议，交企业行政部门或者其他有关方面执行。国营企业既然是全民所有的企业，而不是企业职工集体所有的企业，所以企业的行政领导人员，当然应该由代表全民利益的国家管理机关任命，而不由职工代表大会选举。但是，如果企业的行政领导人员不称职，职工代表大会不仅有权给予批评，还可以在必要的时候，建议上级管理机关撤销他的职务。职工代表大会对上级管理机关的决定有不同意见的时候，也有权向上级机关提出建议。但是如果上级管理机关经过研究仍旧坚持原来的决定，那就必须贯彻执行。这些，都是符合于在民主基础上的集中和在集中指导下的民主，即民主集中制这个不可动摇的基本原则的。
    试点的另一个重要经验是，在国营工业交通企业中建立的职工代表大会，同工会会员代表大会应该是一套组织，它不需要也不应该抛开工会而“另起炉灶”。工会委员会不仅要负责准备和召开职工代表大会，而且在职工代表大会休会期间，要负责监督行政领导上对职工代表大会有关生产行政工作决议的执行。在下届职工代表大会上，工会委员会要作监督决议执行情况的报告。这样，就可以加强和充分发挥工会组织的作用。如果把职工代表大会同工会会员代表大会分作两套机构，不仅代表大会次数加多，浪费职工的时间和精力，而且机构重叠，开起会来和在会后办起事来也免不了有许多内容重复和职责不清的地方，因而免不了减低工作效率，削弱工会组织的作用。
    要使国营企业中的职工代表大会制度能够健康地建立和推行起来，企业党委的正确领导起着决定的作用。根据各地试点的经验，企业党委必须在每一个具体问题上，正确地处理全国人民的整体利益和长远利益同本单位职工群众的局部利益和暂时利益的关系；必须正确地调节企业行政领导同工会组织和职工群众的关系。对于职工代表大会的议题，党委不要事先作出硬性的决定，好让会议能够无拘束地表现职工群众的意志；但是，对于会议中讨论的重大问题，党委又要有明确的方针，并且通过党员的积极活动，加强对会议的思想领导，力求使会议不致作出错误的不能执行的决定。在职工代表大会上，职工代表的意见即使是错误的，也应该允许自由发表，而不要定出种种清规戒律，限制群众的民主权利。对于错误的意见，当然需要进行说服，但是必须注意，绝不要妨碍了职工群众的积极性。在职工代表在会议上正确地批评行政领导的官僚主义错误的时候，党委不仅不应该去作辩护，而且应该热情地支持这种有益的批评，依靠群众的力量去克服行政领导上的官僚主义缺点。党委还要领导企业行政方面积极执行职工代表大会的决议。
    无论工厂管理的民主程度怎样扩大，在我们的国家内，企业生产管理的指挥，都必须由行政领导者负完全责任。所以党委需要加强在职工中的政治思想工作，使职工代表大会和工会委员会在他们的工作中，务必不要妨害厂长在企业行政上的负责制。党委和工会都需要教育全体职工遵守企业的规章和劳动纪律，服从行政领导者的命令和指挥。这样，才能达到调动企业中的一切积极因素去搞好生产，全面地超额地完成国家计划的目的。
    从各地最近关于召开职工代表大会的试点工作的初步总结中，我们以为，可以提出以上的一些看法。关于召开职工代表大会的初步经验，虽然一般是成功的和可行的，但是还显然没有成熟。我们希望各地党委和人民委员会责成所属的工业交通企业部门，继续将试行职工代表大会办法的经验总结出来，以便使这种经验更加完善，并在各地国营企业中分批推广。
