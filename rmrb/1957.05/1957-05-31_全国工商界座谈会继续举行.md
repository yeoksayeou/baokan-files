The National Industrial and Commercial Circles Symposium continued yesterday with its twelfth session, convened by the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee. Speakers at the session included Liu Yongye, Vice Chairman of the Fujian Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce; Dong Shaochen, Standing Committee Member of the Tianjin Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce (Manager of Tianjin Paper Mill); Che Chongyuan, Secretary-General of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association (Deputy Manager of Tianjin Paint and Pigment Company); Zhang Yuanshan, Standing Committee Member of the China Democratic National Construction Association; Chen Shuceng, Director of the Business Committee of Shanghai Cotton Textile Industry Company; Lu Yannan, Standing Committee Member of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce (Vice Chairman of the Guangxi Federation of Industry and Commerce); and Yao Weijun, Member of the Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association.

Liu Yongye suggested in his speech that the government should greatly liberalize the operations of small merchants and peddlers to allow for free competition. He believes that China has a large population with diverse needs for goods, and small merchants and peddlers have their own conditions for existence. If small merchants and peddlers are greatly liberalized, it will not only facilitate the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas and meet the needs of the people, but also increase employment opportunities. He said: The current free market is very chaotic, not because it is being controlled too rigidly, but because it is not being managed at all. If they are managed well, they will play a significant role.

Dong Shaochen said: I do not advocate the complete withdrawal of public representatives. He also said: I propose selecting a few pilot points for a one-year experiment, and then fully implementing the practice after it matures.

In his speech, Dong Shaochen gave a more detailed explanation on the issue of withdrawing public representatives: He said that since the People's Daily published my proposal on public representatives under the title "Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce Standing Committee Member Dong Shaochen Suggests Withdrawing Public Representatives from Joint Ventures," some people said that I wanted to usurp the leadership of the working class, that I wanted to rebel, and that I was too bold. Later, some people helped me explain that the title was somewhat different from my original intention, and some people blamed me for not admitting what I had said. Therefore, I felt somewhat heavy-hearted. I originally wanted to clarify, but some people advised me not to, in order to play a leading role in "speaking out and airing views."

He said that when the reporter from Ta Kung Pao interviewed me, I had no systematic preparation and just casually expressed my views on this issue. Our capitalists have received education from the Party for seven years. After the joint ventures, although we were assigned work, as state public servants, we always felt that we had nothing to do; judging by our own abilities, we were not incapable. This reflects the depressed mood of private personnel who have positions without power. I think that to make private personnel self-reliant laborers, we cannot just rely on empty words and lessons. We must allow private personnel to be tempered in the practice of enterprise management. Therefore, I suggest that under the leadership and support of the enterprise Party branch, the national plan and specific businesses should be handed over to capable private personnel, and the public representatives should be assigned to more important jobs (later, Xinhua News Agency broadcasted that the public representatives should be withdrawn). This is of positive significance to private personnel. I do not advocate withdrawing all public representatives indiscriminately, which would be harmful. I only said to select a few pilot points for a one-year experiment, and then fully implement the practice after it matures. I think this has several benefits: first, private personnel can have the opportunity to learn socialist management techniques and become laborers in the true sense of the word; second, it can streamline the organization, and public representatives can focus on Party work; third, the Party leadership can grasp the overall situation and strengthen the relationship between private personnel and the Party organization, so as to improve production.

After Dong Shaochen's speech, Che Chongyuan added a point of view. He said: On the question of "whether or not public representatives should be withdrawn," some industrialists and businessmen in Tianjin agree and some disagree. I personally think that in the individual joint venture stage, it was necessary to send public representatives. However, after the entire industry was jointly operated, the situation is different. Generally, specialized companies have been established, and small enterprises have become workshops. It is worth considering whether it is necessary to send public representatives at every level. However, a complete withdrawal is inconceivable, because class relations still exist, and workers' perceptions of private personnel cannot be changed overnight.

Zhang Yuanshan said: "Achievements are the main thing, and shortcomings are individual," which is easy to become a shield for bureaucracy.

Zhang Yuanshan said: The Party calls on non-Party members to help the Party rectify its work, and we feel it is our duty to do so. I have worked in the Counselor's Office of the State Council for five years. The Counselor's Office has moved several times, and the further it moves, the more difficult I feel it is to get closer to the Party. Now the three major isms have developed to a dangerous degree. Many opinions are not dealt with in a timely manner, and the problems are accumulating. The wall between the Party and the masses is getting thicker and the ditch is getting deeper. Some issues have been decided by the higher authorities, but they are kept secret when they reach the lower levels, and they cannot be implemented. He said: There are too many things that are kept secret now, even the daily schedule of some sanatoriums is kept secret. He suggested that the government should narrow the scope of secrecy so that more people can know more about the country.

He said: After liberation, in official documents, we often see the phrase: "Achievements are the main thing, and shortcomings are individual." This phrase easily numbs everyone's awareness of shortcomings and becomes a shield for bureaucracy. Everyone should be vigilant about small shortcomings, because small ones will develop into large ones, and individual ones will develop into universal ones. He finally hoped that the Party would strengthen education for Party members, and that both public and private personnel would study together and receive the same education, so that their ideological understanding would be consistent.

Chen Shuceng raised the opinions of capitalist agents on remuneration.

In his speech, Chen Shuceng reflected the opinions of capitalist agents in the Shanghai cotton textile industry on remuneration, which he believes is one of the internal contradictions in the cotton textile industry. He said that the interim regulations on joint state-private enterprises have clear provisions on the remuneration of capitalist agents, which shows that remuneration is a legitimate benefit (though not necessarily a reasonable benefit) that capitalist agents should receive. Capitalist agents have been raising the issue of remuneration for more than a year, but the leaders of the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce have been dragging their feet, seemingly preparing to drag it out for three to seven years, turning this legitimate benefit into an illegitimate one. He believes that the government's handling of this issue is flawed; last year they said that there was no need to talk about remuneration, and this year they said that private parties could negotiate on their own, which is a real puzzle. This situation reflects the lack of common language between the capitalist agents and the leadership of the cotton textile industry association.

Next, he criticized Qian Jiaju's speech. He said that from the perspective of capitalist agents, Qian Jiaju's speech is very different from the thoughts and feelings of our capitalist agents. He disagreed with Qian Jiaju's saying that queuing to buy things would breed some nostalgia for capitalism in their minds; on the contrary, if they are dissatisfied with queuing, it is only a yearning for socialism, which is a manifestation of initiative. He also believes that Qian Jiaju's description of transformation as transcendence is incorrect. He said that most of us industrialists and businessmen are afraid of having our tendons pulled out and our skin peeled off, and we also do not feel comfortable with transcendence. If we say that the working class is a saintly class and the bourgeoisie is a mortal class, then I am afraid that many bourgeois will give up transformation, and many workers will betray their class.

Next, he reflected the dissatisfaction of some agents in Shanghai: saying that we agents are acting for too many things. We act for business management, act for exploiting workers, act for the five vices, act for receiving education, act for big bosses to get through, act for… But those in the leadership of industrial and commercial groups (i.e., agents representing the capitalist agents) represent but do not act, and act but do not represent. Finally, he demanded to have their own representatives in organizations such as the Federation of Industry and Commerce and the China Democratic National Construction Association.

Lu Yannan hopes to change the term "capitalist."

In his speech, Lu Yannan mainly talked about the relationship between public and private. He said: Now some Party members and members of the Communist Youth League still look at private personnel with old eyes and do not trust them. In one factory, when the higher authorities have something to notify and call a meeting, if the factory director is not there, they let the secretary go; if the secretary is not there, they let the Party branch secretary go; if the Party branch secretary is not there, they let the chairman of the trade union go; if none of them are there, they would rather be absent than let a private person go. In some factories, if Party members and non-Party members make mistakes, the methods of education are also different: one is internal education, and the other is a meeting for criticism, and even a circular is issued. He said: We are capitalists, but we feel uncomfortable when someone calls us "capitalists," "Mr.," or "boss." We feel very excited when we hear someone call us "comrades." He hopes that the society can change the way they are addressed, and he hopes that newspapers can also be lenient, and not call them capitalists all the time.

He said: Removing walls and filling ditches requires the joint efforts of both the public and private sectors. From the perspective of private personnel, we must eliminate the three evils, namely, negativity, complacency, and inferiority. Since we are state public servants, we must act like masters of our own affairs, face our own shortcomings squarely, learn with humility, not be afraid of being rejected, take the initiative to strive for public leadership, and actively play the role of "wealth." From the Party's side, we must strengthen the education of Party members and League members on the united front policy, let them make friends with non-Party members, speak their minds, the public side must boldly trust private personnel, and treat private personnel with sincerity; in enterprises, the democratic management committee must be established quickly, and the "Eighth Office" and the Federation of Industry and Commerce must participate in drafting the charter in order to reflect various opinions.

Finally, he pointed out that their provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce does not have a Party member secretary-general, and they encounter many difficulties in their work, and requested the United Front Work Department to send them a Party member secretary-general or a Party member director of the office.

In her speech, Yao Weijun mainly reflected on the situation of the families of industrialists and business people and female industrialists and business people. She believes that the families of industrialists and business people and female industrialists and business people have played a great role in socialist transformation. Many of them have received learning opportunities and their thinking has improved, and some of them have gradually been assigned work. However, there are still many problems. For example, some cannot participate in learning and social activities because of too much housework or the lack of support from male industrialists and business people; some key members do not have time to do housework because of too many social activities, and their spouses also get angry. She suggested that relevant parties should educate male industrialists and business people. She also reflected the difficulties in life for some families of small and medium-sized industrialists and business people, and suggested that the government should give them appropriate care. She also reflected the difficulties and discrimination encountered by women in the promotion of contraception, and called on the government to promote it in many ways and protect the health of women and children in accordance with the Constitution.

    全国工商界座谈会继续举行
    本报讯　中共中央统战部召开的工商界座谈会，昨天举行第十二次座谈。会上发言的有福建省工商联副主任委员刘永叶、天津市工商联常委（天津造纸公司经理）董少臣、中国民主建国会天津市委员会秘书长（天津油漆颜料公司副经理）车重远、中国民主建国会常委章元善、上海棉纺工业公司业务委员会主任委员陈述曾、全国工商联常委（广西工商联副主委）卢燕南、中国民主建国会中央委员姚维钧。
    刘永叶在发言中，建议政府让小商小贩大大开放，来进行自由竞争。他认为中国人口多，需要的商品花色品种也多，小商小贩有它存在的条件。如果能让小商小贩大大开放，一方面可以沟通城乡物资交流，满足人民需要，一方面又增加一个劳动就业的场所。他说：现在自由市场很混乱，不是由于管得太死，而是没有管；只要把他们很好地管起来，他们是会起很大作用的。
    董少臣说：我不主张完全撤出公方代表。他又说：我主张选择几个点以一年为期进行试验，成熟后再全面推行。
    董少臣在发言中对于撤出公方代表问题做了比较详细的说明：他说，自从人民日报以“天津工商联常委董少臣建议撤出合营企业公方代表”为题登出我对公方代表的主张以后，有人说我想纂夺工人阶级的领导权，说我要造反，说胆子太大了。后来有人帮我做了解释，说明这个标题和我的原意有些出入，有人又责怪我说了话不承认。因此，思想上有些沉重，本想申明一下，也有人劝我不要申明，为了“鸣、放”起个带头作用。
    他说，本来大公报记者访问的时候，我并没有系统的准备，就随便说了对这个问题的看法。我们资本家接受党的教育已经七年了。合营后，虽然安排了工作，但作为国家公职人员，总觉得无事可做；衡量自己的能力，又不是干不了。这反映了私方人员有职无权的苦闷心情。我想，要使私方人员成为自食其力的劳动者，不能只靠空洞的语言教训一番，必须让私方人员在企业管理的实践中去锻炼才有可能。因此，我建议在企业党支部领导和支持下，把国家计划、具体业务交给具有才能的私方人员负责，让公方代表放到更重要的工作岗位（后来新华社播出来是撤出公方代表），这对私方人员是有积极意义的。我不主张不加区别地把公方代表完全撤出，那样做是有害的，我只是说选择几个点以一年为期进行试验，成熟后，再全面推行。我认为这样做有几个好处：第一、私方人员可以有条件学会社会主义管理技术，成为名副其实的劳动人民；第二、可以精简机构，公方代表可专做党的工作；第三、党的领导可以掌握全面情况，可以密切私方与党组织的关系，把生产搞得更好。
    董少臣发言后，车重远又补充了一点意见。他说：关于“公方代表要不要撤出”的问题，天津市的工商业者有的同意，有的反对。我个人认为在个别合营阶段，公方代表是非派不可的，但是全行业合营以后，情况不同了，一般都成立了专业公司，小的企业变成了车间，层层都派公方代表是否必要，值得考虑。不过全部撤出，是不堪设想的，因为阶级关系还存在，工人对私方人员的观感还不能一下子改变过来。
    章元善说：“成绩是主要的，缺点是个别的”，这句话容易成为官僚主义的护身符。
    章元善说：党号召党外人士帮助党整风，我们感到义不容辞。我曾在国务院参事室工作了五年，参事室搬了几次家，愈搬愈远，我也感到愈想靠近党愈困难。现在三大主义已经发展到危险的程度，很多意见反映上去得不到及时处理，问题愈积愈多，党与群众之间的墙也就愈厚、沟也就愈深。有些问题，上面已经作出决定，到了下面又被保密起来，没能贯彻。他说：现在保密的事情太多，甚至有的疗养所的作息时间都保密。他建议政府把保密范围缩小，让更多的人知道国家更多的事情。
    他说：解放后，在公文里常常会看到这样的话：“成绩是主要的，缺点是个别的”。这句话容易麻痹大家对缺点的认识，做了官僚主义的护身符。大家要对小的缺点提高警惕，因为小的会发展成大的，个别的也会发展成普遍的。他最后希望党对党员加强教育，希望公方和私方一齐学习，同时受同样教育，以便思想认识一致。
    陈述曾提出了资方代理人对酬劳金的意见。
    陈述曾发言中反映了上海棉纺业资方代理人对酬劳金的意见，他认为这个问题是棉纺业内部矛盾之一。他说，在公私合营企业暂行条例中资方代理人的酬劳金有着明确的规定，这说明酬劳金是资方代理人应得的合法利益（当然不一定是合理的利益）。资方代理人提出酬劳金问题已经一年多了，而上海工商联的领导人物一拖再拖，似乎准备拖过三年七年，把这个合法利益变为不合法。他认为政府对这个问题的处理是有缺点的；去年说，酬劳金不必谈了，今年又说，可以由私方自己协商，真是一个哑谜。这个情况，反映了资方代理人同棉纺业同业公会的领导层之间是缺少共同语言的。
    接着，他对千家驹的发言提出了批评。他说，从资方代理人的角度来看，千家驹的发言跟我们资方代理人的思想感情有着很大的距离。他不同意千家驹所说排队买东西会在思想上滋生一些留恋资本主义的情绪；相反，如果对排队有所不满，只是对社会主义的向往，是积极性的表现。他认为千家驹把脱胎换骨说成超凡入圣也不对，他说，我们绝大部分工商业者对于抽筋剥皮固然害怕，而对于超凡入圣也不感觉舒服，如果说工人阶级是圣人阶级，资产阶级是凡人阶级，那恐怕有许多资产阶级要放弃改造，工人阶级也有许多要背叛自己的阶级。
    接着，他反映上海一些代理人的不满情绪：说我们代理人代理得太多了。我们代理经营管理，代理剥削工人，代理五毒，代理受教育，代理大老板过关，代理……而那些在工商界团体领导层里的人物（即代理资方的代理人）却是代而不表，表而不代。最后他要求在工商联、民建等组织中有自己的代表席位。
    卢燕南希望改变对“资本家”的称呼。
    卢燕南在发言中，主要谈的是公私关系。他谈到：现在有些党团员仍以旧眼光看待私方人员，对他们不信任。有个厂，上级有事通知开会，厂长不在，让秘书去；秘书不在，让党支书去；党支书不在，让工会主席去；都不在，宁可缺席，也不让私方人员去。有的厂，党与非党人士犯了错误，教育方式也不同，一是内部教育，一是开会批评，甚至发通报。他说：我们是资本家，但是有人叫我们“资本家”、“先生”或“老板”，心里总有些不舒服，听到有人称“同志”，心里就很兴奋，他希望社会上能改变对他们的称呼，希望报馆也能笔下留情，不要左一个资本家，右一个资本家。
    他说：拆墙、填沟，要公私双方一齐来搞。从私方人员来说要除三害，即消极性、自满情绪和自卑感。我们即是国家的公职人员，就要拿出当家作主的样子，正视自己的缺点，虚心学习，不怕碰钉子，主动争取公方领导，积极发挥“财富”作用。从党这方面来说，要加强对党团员的统战政策教育，让他们和党外人士交朋友，说知心话，公方要大胆信任私方人员，要与私方人员真诚相见；在企业里，要把民主管理委员会很快建立起来，草拟章程时，要有八办和工商联参加，以便反映多方面的意见。
    最后，他提出：他们省工商联没有党员秘书长，工作中遇到很多困难，要求统战部给他们派个党员秘书长或党员办公室主任。
    姚维钧发言中，主要反映工商界家属和女工商业者的情况，她认为工商界家属和女工商业者在社会主义改造中起了很大作用，他们之中不少人得到了学习机会，思想有了提高，其中有些人也逐渐得到了安排。但是还存在很多问题。如有的因为家务事多、或男工商业者不支持，不能参加学习和社会活动；有些骨干分子因社会活动太多，家务劳动没时间搞，爱人也发脾气。她建议有关方面要对男工商业者进行教育。她还反映了一些中小户工商业者家属生活困难情况，建议政府对他们给予适当照顾。她又反映了妇女在节育宣传中所遇到的困难和歧视，要求政府要多方面宣传，并按宪法规定保护妇女儿童的健康。
