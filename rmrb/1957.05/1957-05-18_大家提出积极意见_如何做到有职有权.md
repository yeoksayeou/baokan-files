Offering Active Suggestions
How to Ensure Responsibility Matches Authority

How can we ensure that non-Party bureau directors and deputy directors have both position and power? Everyone has put forward many positive suggestions for improvement: It is requested that the Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal People's Committee leadership truly value this, that the Party groups of each bureau support it, and that Party members be educated to change their attitudes of disrespecting non-Party leaders. Non-Party bureau directors and deputy directors should not have a "guest" mentality and should strengthen their sense of responsibility.

One, from now on, the Party's leadership should be strengthened, but this leadership should focus on matters, not on individuals, and all staff members, whether Party members or not, should be treated equally.

Two, there should be extensive contact. The Municipal Party Committee should open its doors and listen to the opinions of the masses. In addition to contacting Party members, they should also contact non-Party staff. This requires leading comrades to put down the airs of leaders, and to ask and talk more with non-Party staff. By doing so, non-Party staff whose work was not good before will also have to work harder.

Three, a set of operating procedures should be formulated, and regular bureau meetings should be established to avoid the Party substituting for the government.

Four, it is hoped that Party and non-Party staff will strengthen contact through regular forums or individual visits. The symposium convened by the Municipal Party Committee this time is very good and should be continued.

At the meeting, criticisms were also raised about the emphasis on politics over professional skills in the use of cadres, the promotion of more Party members, and the promotion of fewer non-Party comrades. Everyone agreed that emphasizing politics is correct, but neglecting professional ability and simply emphasizing Party membership and seniority is not. As long as a cadre is both virtuous and talented, whether a Party member or not, promotion should be equal. Everyone also suggested that those who were wrongly struggled against in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries should be resolved in the rectification campaign.

The symposium will continue on the 20th.

    大家提出积极意见
    如何做到有职有权
    如何做到非党局长、副局长有职有权呢？大家提出了许多积极的改进意见：要求市委、市人民委员会领导上要真正重视，各局党组支持，教育党内同志改变不尊重非党负责人的态度。非党局长、副局长不要有作客思想，要加强责任感。
    一，从现在起，要加强党的领导，但这种领导要对事不对人，对于非党工作人员，要一视同仁。
    二，要进行广泛的接触，市委要开大门，倾听群众意见。除了和党员接触外，还要接触非党工作人员，这需要领导同志放下领导人的面孔，对非党工作人员要多问多谈，这样做，原来工作不好的非党工作人员，也不能不加油了。
    三，要制定一套办事制度，建立正常的局务会议，不要以党代政。
    四，希望经常采取座谈会或个别访问的形式，加强党与非党工作人员的联系。这次市委召开的这种座谈会很好，要继续保持。
    会上对使用干部重政治轻业务，提拔党员多，提拔非党同志少，也提出了批评。大家认为重政治是对的，但忽视业务能力，单纯地重党员、重资格是不对的。只要是德才兼备的干部，不管是党员还是非党员，提拔应该也是一视同仁的。大家对在肃反中被错斗争的人，也提出了要在整风中加以解决。
    座谈会将在20日继续举行。
