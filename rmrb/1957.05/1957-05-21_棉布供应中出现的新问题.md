	New Problems Arising in Cotton Cloth Supply
	Since the second round of cloth coupons were allowed to be used at half-value, some abnormal phenomena have appeared in cotton cloth markets in various places.

	First, the number of people applying for temporary cloth use has increased. For example, in Harbin City, requests for cloth for weddings, births, and deaths have suddenly increased recently. In Nangang District of the city, there were 51 applications for birth cloth on April 15th, which increased to 109 on April 22nd; in Daoli District, 6,000 to 7,000 feet of cloth were requested for weddings in one day on April 24th, and more than a dozen households applied for death cloth before the person had even died. In Luojiang District of Chongqing City, two cadres who had children eight months ago are now also applying for supplementary birth cloth. Jiangsu Province has discovered that temporary cloth use certificates issued previously are now being used to buy cloth. Generally, very little is actually bought, and most people request that the remaining amount be returned as previous cloth coupons. For example, in Lihua Cloth Store in Nanjing City, out of 184 feet of temporary cloth certificates collected, 106 feet of cloth coupons were found.

	Second, cases of buying and selling cloth coupons have been discovered. In Huangpi, Xiaogan, and other counties in Hubei Province, some people are buying cloth coupons for three cents per foot and selling them in Hanyang County for three cents per foot. In Dongchang District of Shanghai City, an agricultural commune member from Nanhui County was peddling thirty-seven whole sheets of Jiangsu Province cloth coupons, totaling 1,036 feet, for two and a half cents per foot.

	Third, some people are altering and fraudulently using cloth coupons. In Wuhan City, cases have been discovered where people are adding red or blue "military use" stamps to the second round of cloth coupons in an attempt to use them without discount. In Xi'an City, a cadre used a numbering machine to change the usage year on a 1955 discarded cloth coupon to 1957 to fraudulently use it; in Shenyang City, some people are using later Shandong cloth coupons, which are similar in color, to pass them off as earlier Liaoning cloth coupons.

	The above situations deserve the attention of cotton cloth supply departments in various places. At the same time, it is necessary to widely educate the masses about saving cloth.

### 棉布供应中出现的新问题

    棉布供应中出现的新问题
    第二期布票对折使用后，各地棉布市场出现了一些不正常的现象。
    首先是申请临时用布的人增加。如哈尔滨市最近请求结婚、生育、死亡用布突然增多，该市南岗区4月15日申请生育用布的有五十一份，22日已增至一百零九份；道里区24日一天申请结婚用布就达六、七千尺，有十几户没等人死就要申请死亡用布。重庆市罗江区有两个干部已生孩子八个月，现在也来补充申请生育用布。江苏省发现以前发出的临时用布证，最近都拿出买布，一般是实买很少，多要求将下余数量找回前期布票，如南京市丽华布店收回一百八十四尺临时布证中，就找出布票一百零六尺。
    其次是发现有买卖布票的情况。湖北省黄陂、孝感等县有人以每丈三分收购布票，贩到汉阳县即提价至三角出售。上海市东昌区有南汇县的一个农业社员，持江苏省的整张布票三十七张，计一千零三十六尺，每尺索价二分五厘兜售。
    第三，有人将布票涂改冒用。武汉市最近陆续发现有将第二期布票加盖红色、蓝色的“军用”二字，企图不打折扣使用。西安市有一个干部在一张1955年废布票上用号码机将使用年限改为1957年冒用；沈阳市有人将颜色近似的山东后期布票冒顶辽宁前期布票使用。
    以上情况值得引起各地棉布供应部门的注意，同时要对群众广泛地进行节约用布的教育。
