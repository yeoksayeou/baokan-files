Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 13th: According to Vietnam News Agency on May 13th: Prince Souphanouvong, leader of the Lao Fighting Forces, welcomed the statement made by Vice-King Phetsarath in Vientiane to the press regarding the issue of Lao unification in a recent statement.

Prince Souphanouvong quoted Phetsarath as saying: "For the sake of the country's interests, Laos must adopt a clear policy, advocating genuine neutrality and implementing the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence." Phetsarath also said, "We are one nation," "There are neither boundaries nor prohibitions, because we are inside one country."

Souphanouvong said that Phetsarath's words fully conformed to the legitimate aspirations of all Lao people.

The statement by the leader of the Lao Fighting Forces was published in the recent issue of "New Laos Newspaper." The statement said that the Lao Fighting Forces are willing to work with Phetsarath to "consolidate the unity within the royal family, religion, and the people in order to safeguard the royal family and religion and support the Kingdom's government in implementing a policy of peaceful neutrality and all agreements signed by both sides."

In his statement, Prince Souphanouvong also accused certain forces, who unsuccessfully obstructed the signing of an agreement between the Lao Fighting Forces and the Kingdom's government, of now stubbornly obstructing the implementation of the agreement stipulating the establishment of a unified national government. Therefore, they have made the situation in Laos more difficult and complex.

Souphanouvong emphasized that Laos is a peace-loving country that longs for territorial unification and complete independence. Therefore, the Lao people are united and resolutely fighting against any interference from any side.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 13th: Vientiane dispatch, Lao Crown Prince Savang Vatthana said in the name of the royal family at the opening of the National Assembly on the 11th that Laos will never accept a solution that divides the country.

The Lao National Assembly, which formally reconvened on the 11th, will begin debating the issue of the Lao Fighting Forces this week.

Prime Minister Phouma said on the 11th that his government had done everything possible to reach an agreement with the Lao Fighting Forces. He said that now the issue must be decided by the parliament.

In response to certain criticisms and demands, Phouma said, "The principle I adhere to is: never subordinate the real interests of the country to the resolution of minor issues, never act rashly, and seek conciliation and trust." He believes that this price is not high in order to end fratricide, for the reconciliation of all Lao people and the reunification of the motherland. Phouma concluded by saying that, in any case, a solution should be sought within the framework of the constitution.

    苏发努冯斥阻挠老挝统一的势力
    表示愿同副国王共同努力维护国家利益和中立政策
    老挝国民议会将讨论国内统一问题
    新华社河内13日电　据越南通讯社13日讯：寮国战斗部队领袖苏发努冯亲王在最近发表的一项声明中，对于副国王佩差拉在万象向报界发表的关于老挝统一问题的谈话表示欢迎。
    苏发努冯亲王援引佩差拉的话说：“为了国家的利益，老挝必须采取一项明确的政策，倡导真正的中立和执行和平共处的五项原则。”佩差拉又说，“我们是一个民族”，“既没有疆界也没有禁令，因为我们在一个国家里面”。
    苏发努冯说，佩差拉的这些话完全符合全体老挝人民的正当愿望。
    寮国战斗部队领袖的声明是在最近一期“新老挝报”上发表的。这项声明说，寮国战斗部队愿意和佩差拉共同努力，来“巩固王室、宗教和人民内部的团结以便保障王室与宗教和支持王国政府执行和平中立政策和双方所签订的一切协议”。
    苏发努冯亲王在他的声明中还指责阻挠寮国战斗部队和王国政府签订协议而没有得逞的某些势力现在顽固地阻挠实现规定要建立一个全国统一的政府的协议。因此，他们使老挝的局势更加困难和复杂。
    苏发努冯强调指出，老挝是一个爱好和平的国家，这个国家渴望着领土统一和完全的独立。因此老挝人民团结一致，同任何方面的任何干涉进行坚决的斗争。
    新华社河内13日电　万象消息，老挝王储萨旺·瓦达纳11日在国民议会开幕的时候以王室名义说，老挝决不接受使国家分裂的办法。
    从11日正式复会的老挝国民议会将在本星期内开始关于寮国战斗部队问题的辩论。
    富马首相在11日说，他的政府已经尽一切力量与寮国战斗部队达成协议。他说，现在这个问题要由议会来作出决定了。
    富马在回答某些批评和要求的时候说，我遵奉的原则是：绝不使国家的真实利益从属于细小问题的解决，决不仓促从事，并且要寻求缓和和信任。他认为，为了结束同胞自相残杀，为了所有老挝人的和好和祖国重新统一，这种代价是不算高的。富马最后说，不管怎样，应该在宪法范围内寻求解决方法。
