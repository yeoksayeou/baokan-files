Agricultural Cooperatives Should Proactively Publicize Their Accounts

    Currently, many leading cadres of cooperatives are able to consult with the masses on matters and pay attention to participating in production, but they fail to publicize financial revenues and expenditures on time, thus preventing cooperative members from effectively supervising the internal financial work. Among the three major aspects of democratic management of cooperatives, the timely publicizing of financial revenues and expenditures is still a weak link in many cooperatives.

    Is it not a pressing demand of the broad masses of cooperative members to have financial revenues and expenditures publicized on time? No, quite the contrary, their demand is very pressing. It should be recognized that, in many cooperatives, the internal contradictions regarding financial matters are quite acute. There are examples in Songjiang County, Jiangsu Province: When the staff members sent by the county leadership to the grassroots units first arrived in the townships, the first demand the cooperative members made of them was: Quickly help our cooperative clarify the accounts! The facts fully prove that in cooperatives that do not publicize their accounts on time or have chaotic financial work, many cooperative members are full of doubts, complain about the cadres, and are not at ease in production; and because everyone is afraid of suffering losses in the future, they rush to ask the cooperative cadres for advances and loans, regardless of whether they are truly needed. In cooperatives with sound financial systems and timely publicized accounts, the situation is different: cooperative members trust the cadres, are at ease in production, and few people ask for advances or loans. As some cooperative members say: As long as we know that the cooperative's accounts are clear, we are not willing to take the cooperative's money to spend it piecemeal. It is better to leave the money in the cooperative and have it distributed in bulk in the future for important uses.

    It is only natural that cooperative members are so concerned about the cooperative's financial revenues and expenditures and so eagerly demand to fully exercise their right to decide and supervise financial matters. Because they know that whether the cooperative's accounts are clear, whether the money is used properly, and whether there is any corruption or embezzlement—all of these are closely related to the vital interests of each cooperative member. However, many leading cadres of cooperatives and leading comrades in counties and districts still lack sufficient understanding of the contradiction between the leadership and the masses on this major economic issue, and therefore have not taken a proactive attitude to improve the financial management of cooperatives, ensure timely publicizing of financial revenues and expenditures, and allow the broad masses of cooperative members to truly exercise their right to supervision.

    Can all cooperatives universally publicize their financial expenditures on time at present? Some comrades lack confidence in this matter. For example, some comrades believe that the working ability of accountants in general cooperatives is currently very low, making it difficult to publicize accounts on time. Of course, the low working ability of accountants is indeed a difficulty; however, this cannot be the main reason for not publicizing accounts on time. In fact, the accountants in those cooperatives that have already managed to publicize their accounts on time do not necessarily have very strong working abilities. The reason they are able to do this is because the leading cadres of the cooperatives highly respect the cooperative members' democratic rights in supervising finances, and because they have actively taken some effective measures to improve the efficiency and quality of accounting work.

    To improve the efficiency and quality of accounting work, it is first necessary to find ways to reduce the burden on accounting staff. Currently, financial management in many cooperatives is excessively centralized, with complicated accounts and a large amount of original statistics all weighing on the cooperative's one or two accountants. This prevents them from completing the tasks of bookkeeping and periodic settlement in a timely manner. Recently, some cooperatives have begun to pay attention to changing this situation by delegating part of the management authority, including financial work, to the production teams. Certain specific matters of financial management can be decided and directly handled by the production teams. In this way, various statistical, bookkeeping, and cashier work within each production team can also be undertaken by the production team's work point recorder, reducing the workload of the cooperative's accountants in this area. Xinghua Agricultural Cooperative in Tonglu County, Zhejiang Province, is a large cooperative formed by the merger of four small cooperatives, with 753 member households. In the past, the cooperative director, accountant, and cashier had to deal with advances and loans every day, busy with approving slips and paying money. Since January of this year, this cooperative has delegated the power to approve members' advances and loans to each production team. The cooperative only controls the overall proportion of advances and loans in each team. Members' advances and loans within the production team must be decided through democratic discussion among the members. This measure, combined with other improvements, has enabled the cooperative to change its passive and chaotic state in financial work. For several months, it has been able to publicize various accounts to the members on a monthly basis, which the members are satisfied with.

    Some cooperatives have not rationally used the strength of their accounting staff, often instructing them to do many miscellaneous tasks, preventing them from concentrating on accounting work and improving their skills more quickly. For example, in some cooperatives, writing summaries, writing reports, issuing certificates, sending notices, etc., are all done by accounting staff. This is obviously unreasonable. Efforts should be made to free the accounting staff from these affairs and allow them to focus on doing a good job in accounting. This is one of the conditions for ensuring timely publicizing of accounts.

    Of course, from the perspective of accounting work itself, it should be improved as much as possible. It is understood that in many places, the agricultural cooperative accounting guidance organizations that were organized one or two years ago have long ceased to be active or are rarely active. On the one hand, business guidance from above has weakened; on the other hand, the leading cadres of general cooperatives often do not pay attention to conducting regular and specific leadership over financial work. This is one of the important reasons why the financial systems of many cooperatives are unsound and the accounts are unclear. This is not right. Recently, rural work comrades in many places have felt that the accounting procedures of cooperatives are too cumbersome and the accounts are too complicated (for example, some cooperatives use more than 100 account books a year), hindering the improvement of accounting work efficiency. Therefore, they are conducting trials to simplify accounts and accounting procedures. This work requires relevant parties to conduct careful research and patient guidance.

    There are still a considerable number of cooperatives that cannot publicize their financial revenues and expenditures on time because people always remember not to establish new accounts until the old accounts are cleared. As a result, over time, the new accounts are not cleared and become old accounts. In the future, it will be even more difficult to thoroughly deal with the old and new accounts mixed together. Although, to the best of our ability, we should seize the time to clear the old accounts and clearly and reasonably determine the property relationship between last year and this year, and the creditor-debtor relationship between the cooperative, the teams, and individuals that occurred in the past, and then publicize the accounts on time in the future on this basis, that would be the best thing to do. However, if this is not possible in the short term due to busy production work and other reasons, then we should not passively wait and let things drift, but should explain the actual situation to the members and first publicize the financial revenues and expenditures for this year on time, ensuring that the members can effectively supervise the financial revenues and expenditures in the future. This is a positive and proactive attitude.

    Currently, the summer harvest pre-distribution is about to begin, and the leading organs and rural work comrades in various places have the responsibility to help the cooperatives to publicize their financial revenues and expenditures on time. As long as we rely on the effective supervision of the cooperative members, we can certainly manage the finances of the cooperatives better, thereby strengthening the unity between the leading cadres and the masses within the cooperatives, and working together to strive for a bumper harvest in agriculture this year.

    农业社要主动公布账目
    现在有许多合作社的领导干部能够做到遇事同群众商量了，也注意参加生产了，可就是财政收支不能按时公开，因此社员群众也就无法对社内财务工作进行有效的监督。在民主办社的三个主要事项中，按时公开财政收支这一点，目前在许多合作社中还是一个薄弱的环节。
    难道广大社员对于按时公开财政收支的要求不迫切吗？不是，恰恰相反，他们的要求是十分迫切的。应该看到，在许多合作社里，目前在财务问题上，表现出的合作社内部矛盾是相当尖锐的。江苏省松江县就有这样的例子：县领导机关派到基层单位的工作人员刚到乡里的时候，社员们向他们提出的第一个要求就是：快帮助我们社把账目搞清楚吧！事实完全证明，凡是不按时公布账目或者财务工作混乱的合作社，许多社员就满腹疑虑，埋怨干部，不安心生产；而且因为大家都怕将来吃亏，就不管是否真正需要，争先恐后地向社干部要求预支、借支。而在那些财务制度较健全、账目也能及时公布的合作社里，则是另一种情况：社员信任干部，安心生产，要求预支、借支的人也很少。正如有些社员们所说的：只要让我们知道社里的账目是清清楚楚的，我们也不愿意把社里的钱要出来零花掉，钱留在社里将来整批分到手里好派大用场。
    社员们这样关心社里的财政收支，这样迫切地要求在财务上充分行使自己的决定权和监督权，本来是很自然的事情。因为他们知道，社里的各项账目是否清楚明白，钱用得是否得当，其中有没有贪污舞弊的现象——这些都同每个社员有着切身的利害关系。可是，现在有许多合作社的领导干部以及县区领导同志，对于在这个重大经济问题上存在着的领导和群众之间的矛盾还缺乏足够的认识，因而没有用积极、主动的态度改进合作社的财务管理，保证按时公开财政收支，让广大社员真正行使监督权。
    目前是否所有的合作社都能够普遍做到按时公布财政开支呢？在这个问题上，有些同志是信心不足的。例如，有些同志认为，现在一般合作社的会计人员的工作能力很低，要按时公布账目就很难办到。当然，会计人员的工作能力低这确是一个困难；但是，这并不能成为不按时公布账目的主要理由。事实上，那些已经做到按时公布账目的合作社，它们的会计人员的工作能力也并不是很强的，它们所以能够做到这点，是因为合作社的领导干部十分尊重社员在监督财务上的民主权利，是因为他们积极采取了一些有效措施来提高会计工作的效率和质量。
    要提高会计工作的效率和质量，首先需要设法减轻会计人员的负担。目前许多合作社的财务管理过分集中，庞杂的账目和大量的原始统计，都压在合作社的一两个会计人员身上。这就妨碍他们及时完成记账和定期结算的任务。最近有些合作社已经开始注意改变这种情况，把包括财务工作在内的部分管理权划给生产队。财务管理上的某些具体事项可以由生产队决定和直接处理。这样，各个生产队内各种统计、记账、出纳工作，也可以由生产队的记工员担负起来，减少社里的会计人员在这方面的工作量。浙江省桐庐县星华农业社，是由四个小社合并起来的、拥有七百五十三户社员的大社。过去，社主任、会计、出纳天天要应付预支、借支的事，忙于批条子、付钞票。从今年1月起，这个社把批准社员预支、借支的权力交给各个生产队。社里只控制各队预支、借支的总的比例。生产队内社员的预支、借支都要经过社员们民主讨论决定。这个措施再加上其他方面的改进，使得这个合作社改变了财务工作上的被动、忙乱状态，几个月来已能按月向社员们公布各项账目，社员们感到满意。
    有些合作社没有合理地使用会计人员的力量，经常吩咐他们去做很多杂事，使得他们不能集中精力做会计工作，更快地提高业务。比如有些合作社，写总结，写报告，开证明，送通知等等，都要找会计人员去做。这显然是不合理的。应该想办法使会计人员从这些事务中摆脱出来，全力搞好会计工作。这是保证按时公布账目的条件之一。
    当然，从会计工作本身来说，也要尽可能地加以改进。据了解，在不少地方，在一两年前组织起来的农业社会计辅导组织，已经好久停止活动或很少活动了。一方面，来自上面的业务辅导削弱了，另方面，一般合作社的领导干部又多不注意对于财务工作进行经常、具体的领导，这是许多合作社财务制度不健全、账目不清楚的重要原因之一。这是不应该的。最近许多地方的农村工作同志都感觉到合作社的会计手续太繁多，账目太复杂（如有的社一年要用一百多本账），妨碍会计工作效率的提高。因此，他们正在进行简化账目和会计手续的尝试。这项工作需要有关方面进行认真的研究和耐心的辅导。
    还有相当多的合作社的财政收支不能按时公开，是因为人们总记住老账没清理完，就不要建立新账。结果时间一久，新账不加清理，积压起来也变成了旧账。将来旧账新账混在一起，要彻底处理就更加困难。虽然，在力所能及的情况下，应该抓紧把旧账清理好，把去年和今年的财产关系，把社、队、个人之间过去发生的债权和债务关系都明确而合理地确定下来，在这个基础上今后按时公布账目，这是再好不过的事。但是，如果因为生产工作繁忙和其他种种原因，在短期内不可能这样做的话，那也不应该消极等待，放任自流，而应该向社员讲清楚实际情况，首先把今年的财政收支按时公开出来，保证社员能够对今后的财政收支进行有效的监督。这才是积极、主动的态度。
    目前，夏收预分就要进行了，各地领导机关和农村工作同志有责任帮助合作社做到按时公布财政收支。只要依靠社员群众的有效监督，一定可以把合作社的财务管理得更好，从而加强合作社内领导干部和群众之间的团结，一致努力争取今年的农业大丰收。
