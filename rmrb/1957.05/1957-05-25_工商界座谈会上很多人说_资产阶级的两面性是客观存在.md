Reported by this newspaper: The United Front Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China convened the eighth forum for industry and commerce on yesterday (24th). Thirteen people spoke at the meeting (one was a written statement), and a discussion was carried out on the issues of the two-sidedness of the bourgeoisie, the fixed interest rate period, and whether or not to remove public representatives. The forum will continue today.

Li Shidao believes: Public representatives can help private personnel to give play to their enthusiasm

The first speaker was Li Shidao, Deputy Director of the Changsha Municipal Industrial and Commercial Transformation Guidance Office. He said: I believe that having public representatives in joint ventures will not only not hinder the private personnel from giving play to their enthusiasm, but also help them to give play to their enthusiasm. The reason is that a person's enthusiasm should be based on ideological awareness. Public representatives have a higher level of political and ideological awareness than private personnel, and they see problems more comprehensively than private personnel, which can help private personnel improve their ideological awareness and correctly handle problems in their work and life. In addition, there are not only public-private relations and public-private contradictions in enterprises, but also contradictions between private individuals and between employees and private individuals, and the latter are often not resolved by private personnel.

He said that of course, some public representatives have shortcomings, such as distrusting private personnel, not allowing private personnel to make suggestions, and not supporting rationalization proposals made by private personnel. However, not all public representatives are like this, and some issues need to be analyzed specifically. For example, some private personnel believe that if the public representative does not adopt their opinions, regardless of whether their opinions are correct or not, it is distrust, which is not right. Therefore, he believes that the system of public representatives should not be abolished because of a few bad public representatives.

Regarding how to improve the relationship between public and private cooperation, he believes that the first is to strengthen the ideological education of both parties, and the second is to establish some necessary systems to clarify the division of labor between the two parties and enable private personnel to have positions and powers. He also suggested that the relevant parties conduct a comprehensive inspection of the public-private relations of joint ventures in conjunction with this rectification campaign.

Gao Zhensheng advocates abolishing the titles of "public side" and "private side"

Gao Zhensheng, Deputy Secretary-General of the Hebei Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce, expressed his disagreement with withdrawing public representatives; the suggestion of "fixed interest for twenty years" proposed by Li Kangnian was opposed not only by young industrialists and businessmen, but also by middle-aged and elderly industrialists and businessmen; the two-sidedness of the bourgeoisie is an objective reality, and it is wrong to say that the working class also has two-sidedness.

He believes that there are class relations in joint ventures, but both the public and private sides are appointed by the government and are under the leadership of the Party to jointly take responsibility for production. Those who are factory directors are called factory directors, and those who are deputy factory directors are called deputy factory directors. Do not distinguish between "public side" and "private side." Because there is the Federation of Industry and Commerce and the board of directors to represent the interests of industry and commerce. He believes that changing this title can reduce or narrow the distance between the public and private sectors, strengthen the private personnel's sense of responsibility for the enterprise, and better exert their enthusiasm.

Yan Esheng criticizes some party member cadres for not understanding the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision"

Yan Esheng, a member of the Shanghai Central Committee of the China National Democratic Construction Association, first pointed out that although the Party has long put forward the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision," there are still many people in democratic parties who doubt this policy. They do not believe that they can coexist for a long time, let alone that they can supervise each other. The reason is that on the one hand, some members of democratic parties themselves have a sense of inferiority. On the other hand, there is insufficient publicity below. To this day, there are still party member cadres at the level of professional company managers in Shanghai who do not know which democratic parties exist in our country. He suggested that the Party put the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" in Party lessons to educate party members.

He said that the issue in democratic parties and people's organizations is not whether or not there are Communist Party members, but how to place the position of party members. He believes that democratic parties and people's organizations are different from enterprises. In enterprises, party members represent the Party to lead the enterprise. In democratic parties and people's organizations, Communist Party members should play a bridging role between the Party and the democratic parties. In the past, some departments did not have enough understanding of this relationship and handled it improperly. For example, when issuing general administrative documents and instructions, they only issued them to individual Communist Party members and not to the unit where the party member was located, which was inappropriate.

He also criticized the phenomenon that public representatives do not pay attention to business learning.

Qian Jiaju's speech

My Views on the Two-Sidedness of the Bourgeoisie and the Redemption Policy

First of all, I want to state that I am not speaking here on behalf of the Industry and Commerce Administration Bureau, but in a private capacity.

There are shortcomings in the transformation of wholesalers, tax policies, and profit distribution. Party member cadres have serious "rather left than right" thinking.

In the past few years, the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce has achieved great results, but there are also shortcomings. Because the peaceful transformation of capitalism is a new creation in our country, with no classic works to rely on and no advanced experience from the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries for reference, mistakes are inevitable, but achievements are the main thing. This achievement has been recognized by the world and by the industry and commerce sector in our country.

Today, I don't want to talk about the achievements, I just want to talk about the shortcomings. For example, as for the transformation of wholesalers, in today's view, there are shortcomings in the work. If it were done better, it would be more beneficial to us. Secondly, the tax policies of the tax authorities have played a certain role in utilization, restriction and transformation, but the income tax is not realistic enough. According to regulations, income tax can only be collected when there is income, and the maximum tax rate cannot exceed 34%; in fact, due to the elimination of unreasonable expenses, taxes are often levied even when there is no income, and the difference between the tax bureau's surplus and the book surplus is very large. The selection of typical cases is done by choosing those who are well off instead of those who are not. The situation of collecting taxes on virtual profits and killing the chicken to get the egg is by no means an isolated phenomenon. For example, in the implementation of profit distribution, many enterprises have not implemented Article 25 of the Interim Regulations on Private Enterprises and the principle of "four horses dividing the fat." Many working cadres often regard policies and measures as objective laws, replacing objectivity with subjectivity. Small industrialists and businessmen are treated in the same way as large industrialists and businessmen. Some people are clearly working people, but they are forcibly given the label of the bourgeoisie. For employees, cadres, staff members and young students from bourgeois backgrounds who want to contribute shares, regardless of whether they are voluntary, whether they have indeed made progress, or whether their source of income does not rely on dividends, all are not accepted except for Communist Party members (only recently has the door been slightly opened, and individuals can be accepted). This is not a realistic approach. When cadres implement policies, they have the thought of "rather left than right." They believe that if they are left, it will only cause deviations, and if they are right, they will lose their position. Even industrial and commercial administrative cadres know that they are biased to the left, but they dare not say it. This is a very serious ideological problem. I won’t talk too much about such things today because it is not a review of policy.

What I want to talk about today is the issue of whether the Chinese national bourgeoisie has two-sidedness, whether the relationship between public-private cooperation is also a class relationship, and how the redemption policy should be understood.

The bourgeoisie is in the process of being eliminated, and bourgeois ideology can never be eliminated before the class is eliminated.

First, regarding the issue of whether the two-sidedness of the bourgeoisie exists and how it should be interpreted. First of all, we should ask whether the bourgeoisie has been completely eliminated today. I believe that the Eighth National Congress document says that the bourgeoisie is "in the process of being eliminated" does not mean that it has been eliminated. To think that it has been eliminated is not in accordance with the facts. The fact is that the state still pays more than 100 million yuan in fixed interest every year, and the state has various arrangements and care for the life and political aspects of bourgeois elements. There are still contradictions and problems between public and private, and between workers and private owners. These are objective facts that are not the product of anyone's subjective will. Now that the national bourgeoisie exists objectively, is it possible for the ideological consciousness of the bourgeoisie to be eliminated before the class is eliminated? This is impossible. Where there is a material basis, there is a superstructure. Where there is a class, there is class consciousness. Moreover, even if bourgeois elements are transformed into self-reliant laborers, it does not mean that the residual thoughts of the bourgeoisie no longer exist, because ideology lags behind reality, which is the general rule. It is precisely because of this that we emphasize the long-term nature and necessity of ideological transformation. Two-sidedness is in line with the dual identity of industrialists and businessmen (before there was a dual identity, there was already two-sidedness, but the content of the two-sidedness was different. During the period of the New Democratic Revolution, the positive side did not include socialist factors. During the period of the socialist revolution, it included socialist factors. After the entire industry was integrated, the socialist factors greatly increased.) After the entire industry was integrated, on the one hand, the capitalists handed over the means of production to the state, and they have basically become state workers and state cadres. In this sense, they are already working people; but on the other hand, they are still different from ordinary working people. They receive fixed interest and have various kinds of care in their lives (such as high salaries that are not reduced, and wages of 50%-70% during sick leave, etc.), so they still retain their bourgeois status. This is a special situation in the transitional period and is an objective fact. On the one hand, they are laborers, and on the other hand, they are capitalists. This is their social status. They have the ideology of the working class and the ideology of the bourgeoisie. These two ideologies are constantly fighting, and the ideology of the working class is constantly overcoming the ideology of the bourgeoisie. This is their ideological state. This duality is the root of two-sidedness. It should be admitted that the working-class side is developing and expanding, and the bourgeois side is constantly shrinking until it disappears, eventually becoming one-sided. This is its development trend. But it does not mean that there is no two-sidedness now. Chairman Mao said that if we do not admit two-sidedness, it is a metaphysical viewpoint, and if this metaphysical viewpoint wins, then the learning task is gone... This does not conform to the wishes of the vast majority of industrialists and businessmen. What is the so-called metaphysical viewpoint? In the final analysis, it is still the socialist side and the capitalist side.

It is not realistic for capitalists to say that they do not miss capitalism.

The so-called capitalist side refers to capitalist ideology, work style, work methods, etc. When we say that they still miss capitalism, we are referring to their ideological situation, not that they still want to take the capitalist road. It is fundamentally impossible to take the capitalist road, and they understand this. Now, does the national bourgeoisie not miss capitalism at all? I am not an industrialist or businessman and cannot answer on their behalf. I am an intellectual from a petty-bourgeois background who studied Marxism-Leninism before liberation, but now sometimes when I see people queuing up to buy things, the quality of products is reduced, or other shortcomings in real life, I can't help but think that as long as you have money, you can get anything you want in capitalist society. Although this thought is fleeting, and although I know it is wrong, it still comes out from time to time. It can be seen that missing capitalism is like "seeing a good hunting ground and being eager to try," which is not an unimaginable thing. Industrialists and businessmen come from capitalist society and are accustomed to the old ways. It seems unrealistic to say that after the entire industry is integrated, they will undergo a complete transformation and not miss capitalism. A friend said: "Complete transformation" is a bad phrase because it easily makes people think of the next sentence, which is "drawing tendons and peeling skin"; Comrade Sun Xiaocun said: Why isn't the next sentence "transcending the ordinary and entering the sacred"? Isn't this a very good sentence? I believe that if the understanding of this sentence refers to destroying capitalism and establishing socialism, then there is nothing wrong with it and it should be done. What's wrong with this approach?

Comrade Bi Mingqi said: "It is not a simple matter for the national bourgeoisie to hand over their enterprises. Many party member comrades cannot appreciate this ideological struggle and change in ideology." Indeed, the national bourgeoisie handed over their enterprises after a difficult ideological struggle. This is evidence that they have accepted transformation. It is precisely because of this that we cannot imagine that after giving up, especially when encountering some difficulties in work, they no longer have the feeling of missing the past, the so-called "small monarch before joint venture, minister of a big country after joint venture, and people of a destroyed country after merger," isn't this an expression of this feeling? At the same time, we cannot agree that the national bourgeoisie gives up the means of production without any nostalgia and is more glorious than the workers who have nothing. This view is incorrect.

Li Kangnian's advocacy of a 20-year fixed interest rate is a manifestation of negativity.

The so-called negative side refers to the capitalist side, and its manifestations are various and the degree varies from person to person. But as a class, it definitely exists. Just taking Li Kangnian's advocacy of a 20-year fixed interest rate as an example, isn't this a manifestation of negativity? Naturally, only a small number of people in the industrial and commercial community agree with Li Kangnian's proposal, which also proves that the negative side does not occupy the main position today, but it cannot be said that this idea is only Li Kangnian's idea. A 20-year fixed interest rate includes not only the idea of wanting to eat exploitation for a lifetime, but also a misunderstanding of the redemption policy, which I will talk about later when I talk about the redemption policy. In addition to this, for example, they are not convinced by the leadership of the working class, etc. The manifestations of negativity are various and the degree to which they exist in each person in the industrial and commercial community is also different, but in general, from a large amount of observation, and from the national bourgeoisie as a class, it still exists (although it is gradually shrinking, which requires continued education). This is an objective fact. The question is, since this objective fact exists, is it good to admit it or not? Is it beneficial to transformation to admit it, or is it beneficial to transformation not to admit it? I think it is still good to admit it, which not only conforms to the spirit of seeking truth from facts, but is also beneficial to transformation. Not admitting it is like avoiding medical treatment, as Chairman Mao pointed out, this does not conform to the wishes of the vast majority of the industrial and commercial community.

The two-sidedness of the bourgeoisie and the conservatism and backwardness of some workers are different in nature; conservative and backward workers never miss capitalism.

Some people say that the bourgeoisie has two sides, and doesn't the working class also have the two sides of progress, advancement, backwardness and conservatism? Are they the same thing? They are not the same thing. The two-sidedness of the bourgeoisie comes from the unique class nature of the bourgeoisie and the ideological consciousness of this class, that is, they are not accustomed to many new things in socialism, and they still have resistance, and they still miss the old days when they could arbitrarily run enterprises and live a wealthy life of exploitation... In short, it comes from the capitalist system. Does the working class have a backward side? Definitely yes, especially in recent years, the ranks of the working class have grown increasingly large, and many farmers have flowed into the cities and become industrial workers, and the conservatism, selfishness, petty greed, and failure to abide by labor discipline that farmers have also brought into the working class; at the same time, they are also affected by the ideological corrosion of the bourgeoisie. But in any case, the conservative side of the working class will never be nostalgia for capitalism, and will never want to work for the boss again. Therefore, the backward and conservative side of the working class and the negativity of the bourgeoisie are different in nature. The working class also needs education and transformation, but it is definitely not a matter of "destroying capitalism."

People who feel that there is no need to learn from the working class are, at heart, unconvinced by the leadership of the working class.

Some people ask, what should the national bourgeoisie learn from the working class? It seems to say that the working class has a lot of shortcomings, such as not cherishing public property, not abiding by labor discipline, selfishness... Do we still have to learn from it? Some people also say that it is completely agreed that the American bourgeoisie should learn from the Soviet working class; but I can't figure out why the Chinese national bourgeoisie should learn from the Chinese working class. This actually implies a problem of being unconvinced by the leadership of the working class. What should the bourgeoisie learn from the working class? I think they should learn the working class's excellent qualities of selflessness, collectivism, discipline, and revolution. They should learn their self-reliant work habits and socialist management methods... In a word, learn socialism. Learning from the working class is learning the working class's position, viewpoint, method, and socialist management methods. These are not abstract but concrete things. Some people cite some shortcomings of workers in certain enterprises and believe that Chinese workers are not worth learning from. Obviously, this is a one-sided view that replaces the whole with the part. Why not cite some examples of the excellent and noble qualities of the Chinese working class to learn from (there are also many such examples)? For some of the shortcomings shown by some workers, we should conduct education. Standing on the position of industrialists and businessmen, we should educate each other in accordance with the principle of "unity-criticism-unity," rather than saying: "Look, the workers also have these shortcomings. You want us to learn from the working class. Do you also want us to learn these shortcomings?" To analyze such a question in depth, isn't it a manifestation of being unconvinced by the leadership of the working class!

There is a wall between labor and capital, and the capitalist side should bear a great responsibility. If the capitalist side thinks about what they did before liberation, they will be calm and peaceful.

Second, is the public-private relationship also a class relationship? This is also a question of objective facts. If it exists, we cannot deny that it does not exist. Subjectively denying existence does not mean that it does not exist objectively. If there is no class relationship, then there is no such thing as a public-private or worker-private relationship. Some of the public-private problems reflected in this forum would also become pointless. Since this fact exists, is it good to admit it or not? I think it is good to admit it. Admitting the existence of contradictions is the only way to solve them. Denying the existence of contradictions will not solve them. At present, some workers do not have a sufficient understanding of the redemption policy and adopt incorrect attitudes towards private personnel. This is a matter of education, and it cannot be solved by denying class relations. It should be admitted that there was a wall between labor and capital in the past. After the integration of the entire industry, this wall has shrunk and is in the process of being dismantled, but it has not been completely dismantled. Industrialists and businessmen should realize that the capitalist side should bear a great responsibility for building this wall. Today, the capitalist side wants to tear down the wall, but the workers have not torn it down or have not completely torn it down. This is also very natural, and the private side should be patient. We cannot imagine that a century of grievances can be resolved at once. Can we deny that capitalists did not exploit and oppress workers in the past? Didn't they beat and scold workers? Let's not talk about whether there were confrontational problems after liberation. At least we can't insist that there were no confrontational problems before liberation! Labor and capital have long been enemies, and it will definitely not be possible to become good comrades overnight. We industrialists and businessmen must have the greatest patience and not be afraid of being rebuffed, and change the views of employees and the masses on national capitalists through work and life. Isn't this what we should do? There are indeed some unfair things that worker comrades have towards the private sector. On the one hand, we must strengthen education for employees, but if industrialists and businessmen think about what they did before liberation from their own perspective, they will be more calm and peaceful.

The bourgeoisie's means of production should have been confiscated; the redemption policy was adopted to make capitalists feel at ease to transform and work at ease, not for the state to pay off the capitalists' debts.

Third, there is the issue of the redemption policy. Li Kangnian suggested that the redemption should take 20 years to be enough, which is a complete misunderstanding of the meaning of the redemption policy. The redemption policy embodies the Party and the state's policy of peacefully transforming capitalist industry and commerce, which is a creative development of Marxism-Leninism, not a revision of Marxism-Leninism. To build socialism, it is necessary to eliminate the capitalist ownership of the means of production. This is the basic principle of Marxism-Leninism; the Soviet Union adopted the policy of confiscation, but our country has different historical conditions, so we adopted the policy of redemption. Although the methods are different, the goal is the same. In the eyes of Marxists-Leninists, the capitalists' means of production are obtained through exploitation and are the accumulation of past surplus value (referring to the entire bourgeoisie, not individual people. Individual members may have accumulated them through labor, but after a few years, the original investment has long been recovered). We want to carry out socialist revolution, so we must eliminate capitalist ownership. It should have been confiscated, and in principle it could have been confiscated, but due to the historical conditions of our country's national bourgeoisie, we did not adopt confiscation but adopted redemption. It should be recognized that these means of production do not inherently belong to capitalists, but were created by the working class and plundered by the bourgeoisie, and now they have been returned to their original owners. The Constitution guarantees the capitalist ownership of capitalists, but it also stipulates that it must be changed to ownership by the whole people through state capitalism. This proves that in the people's China, the capitalist ownership of the means of production is not sacred and inviolable. The state pays fixed interest, and the purpose of this is to enable capitalists to transform and work with peace of mind. In this sense, fixed interest has its positive significance. However, some friends in the industrial and commercial community have misinterpreted the meaning of redemption. In their view, redemption is a debt owed by the state to the capitalists, which the state pays off in installments. Since redemption is to be redeemed to the end, otherwise it is better to simply say it is confiscation. Li Kangnian proposed 20 years, and some people also said, "We take fixed interest because the Communist Party wants to give it to us to maintain the government's face and for international influence." These ideas are completely wrong. The error lies in viewing the redemption as a debt owed by the state to the capitalists, which must be repaid; taking fixed interest is a matter of course and is a glorious thing. This idea is not conducive to transformation because they have forgotten the fundamental truth that exploitation is shameful and have negated what they have learned in the past.

Secondly, when should the redemption be calculated from? I think it should be calculated from 1949. The Regulations on Private Enterprises were redemption (although some enterprises did not implement it), and "four horses dividing the fat" was also redemption, and fixed interest was also redemption. From the Regulations on Private Enterprises to seven years of fixed interest (1949-1962), there are a total of 14 years. During these 14 years, the redemption money recovered by the enterprise was either more, or just right, or less. There are only these three situations. If we calculate each enterprise one by one, it will be very difficult. The redemption should also include high salaries, the salaries of directors, etc. In general, after 14 years, the redemption of the means of production is almost the same. The government said that after seven years, it can still drag its tail, which is also said from a political point of view (not calculating the details, calculating the details is unreasonable and impossible), which refers to some capitalists who still have difficulties in life, and they can drag their tail. The purpose of this is also to make him feel at ease to transform without worrying about life. Industrialists and businessmen should realize that redemption is an arrangement made by the state to transform them, not a debt owed to them that must be repaid. Naturally, this arrangement is not only for the benefit of the bourgeoisie, but also for the benefit of the working class and the entire country. If you think that the state owes them, and that the seven years of fixed interest is that the state has taken 65% of the oil and taken advantage, this not only does not conform to the facts (redemption should be calculated from 1949), but for industrialists and businessmen, it is also equivalent to learning in vain, and this is not destroying capitalism but establishing capitalism.

Bureaucracy is serious in the leadership of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, and I hope to rectify it properly.

Finally, I would like to make a suggestion on the work of the Federation of Industry and Commerce. The Federation of Industry and Commerce has done a lot of work in the past few years, such as reflecting the opinions of industrialists and businessmen, representing their legitimate interests, uniting and educating capitalists, accepting transformation, organizing learning, and participating in various patriotic movements, which has played a certain role in promoting the transformation work, which is good. But on the other hand, it must also be admitted that they are very insufficient in representing the legitimate interests of industrialists and businessmen, especially in representing the interests of small and medium-sized industrialists and businessmen. The leaders at the upper levels are divorced from the masses, and they dare not say what they want to say, and they dare not argue. Of course, there are subjective and objective reasons for this, and we cannot blame the Federation of Industry and Commerce entirely, but the fact that the Federation of Industry and Commerce has not been able to truly represent the legitimate interests of industrialists and businessmen, and the phenomenon that the leaders are high above and divorced from the masses is quite serious. At the same time, there are also individual party member cadres in the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce who seriously oppress the masses and violate laws and regulations, which has never been seriously dealt with. The cadres who violated laws and regulations have also been promoted, and rewards and punishments for party and non-party cadres are unclear, and right and wrong are not distinguished. These all prove that the bureaucracy in the leadership of the Federation of Industry and Commerce is quite serious. I hope that this rectification campaign will seriously deal with it.

I hope that the industrial and commercial community will break through their concerns and try their best to criticize the shortcomings in the past transformation work.

In the past, the industrial and commercial community had many concerns and did not dare to express their opinions publicly. Through this debate, everyone has said what is on their minds, which is a good phenomenon. I hope that friends in the industrial and commercial community will break through their concerns and continue to speak freely, and try their best to raise opinions on the shortcomings in the past transformation work. To truly achieve debate, we must launch debate, launch criticism and self-criticism, and distinguish right from wrong. Some opinions seem to be fighting for the legitimate interests of the bourgeoisie, such as denying two-sidedness and advocating a 20-year fixed interest rate, but in essence, they are not conducive to transformation and must be criticized, so that it is conducive to transformation and beneficial to the industrial and commercial community.

Wang Jinbiao said: 90% of young industrialists and businessmen in Tianjin disagree with extending the fixed interest. He also said: Public representatives cannot be withdrawn, and there will be more contradictions if they are withdrawn.

The fifth speaker was Wang Jinbiao, Deputy Chief of the Production Planning Section of the Tianjin No. 4 Mechanical Industry Company. He focused on reflecting the opinions and requirements of young industrialists and businessmen in Tianjin. He said: 90% of young industrialists and businessmen in Tianjin (including myself) disagree with Li Kangnian's proposal to extend the fixed interest for 20 years. They are very angry and unwilling to wear the hat for another 13 years.

He said that the young industrialists and businessmen of small and medium-sized households in Tianjin are very eager to give up the fixed interest because, in the past few years since liberation, they have realized the shamefulness of exploitation under the education of the Party; after the integration of the entire industry, most of them have been well arranged and their lives have been guaranteed; they know that they will live in socialist society for a long time and are unwilling to be capitalists and discriminated against. However, not only has no one supported their sincere request, but some people have also said that they are falsely active, want to take advantage of loopholes, and enjoy labor insurance. Some people are therefore dissatisfied with the government and have a pessimistic and disappointed mood. He hopes that the government will seriously consider their request and formulate a standard for who can take off their hats so that they have a direction to work towards.

He said that public representatives cannot be withdrawn. It is terrible to withdraw them. Although there are contradictions if they are not withdrawn, there will be more contradictions after they are withdrawn. Private personnel will have no way to deal with it and will be more depressed. He believes that the abnormal public-private relationship can be resolved as long as both parties take a positive attitude.

Finally, he criticized the current situation in joint ventures where public representatives spend too much time going out to meetings and have no time to grasp production.

The speech of Xiao Xinyi, Deputy Director of the Beijing Industrial and Commercial Research Office, mainly reflects the working relationship between the Federation of Industry and Commerce and the China National Democratic Construction Association. He believes that the current division of labor between the Federation of Industry and Commerce and the China National Democratic Construction Association is unclear, and there is duplication of work content, resulting in mutual competition for people, work, and time, and the forces of both sides are mutually offset; and the backbone members of the China National Democratic Construction Association are often pulled away by the Federation of Industry and Commerce, and the work is in a state of no one in charge, so that the cadres are not at ease with the work of the China National Democratic Construction Association. He asked the United Front Work Department to help them solve these problems. Jin Bintong said:

Democratic party cadres are in a state of being in nobody's charge and not being like anything.

Jin Bintong, Deputy Secretary-General of the Wuhan China National Democratic Construction Association, talked about his understanding of the redemption policy. He said: The capitalist's means of production are exploited from the workers, so it is natural for the workers to take back the means of production from the capitalists. It is obviously inappropriate for some people to understand redemption as an equal or unequal transaction.

He also criticized the United Front Work Department for not caring about or valuing the cadres of democratic parties, which puts the cadres of democratic parties in a state of being in nobody's charge and not being like anything. He also reflected that the work of some directors or deputy directors of the trade association has not been properly arranged. Tan Zhiqing said: The two-sidedness of the bourgeoisie exists,

But the positive side is the main one.

Tan Zhiqing, Deputy Secretary-General of the China National Democratic Construction Association, said that the two-sidedness of the bourgeoisie still exists, and the positive side is the main one, while the negative side is the secondary one. The specific manifestations of negativity: wavering, weakness, fear of criticism, watching the wind, being concerned about gains and losses, strong individualism, nostalgia for luxurious life, hope for a 20-year fixed interest, etc. However, we have made great progress in the past few years. For example, the attendance rate of learning has reached more than 90%, advanced elements and advanced figures are increasing day by day, and some people participate in labor competitions with workers and are more patriotic. In the situation where the large-scale class struggle in the country has basically ended, the main task at present is to develop production rather than class struggle. However, people's thinking is often bound by old theoretical viewpoints, and they are accustomed to observing today's problems with past viewpoints and methods, which is not conducive to socialism.

Talking about further strengthening the transformation of the private sector, he believes that in addition to using enterprises as the base, we should strengthen the work of the Federation of Industry and Commerce in this regard. Wang Xianzhen said: It is dangerous to pick melons before they are ripe.

Wang Xianzhen, Deputy Secretary-General of the Fujian Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce, said that the bourgeoisie has a very long history, and it is not so simple to transform them into workers in a few years.

Many people say that now is the time for the melons to ripen, so why not pick them? 80-90% of people can be picked first, and 10-20% of people can be slower. He believes that this way of looking at the problem is not comprehensive. Whether a melon is ripe or not cannot only depend on the color, but also on whether the taste is fragrant and sweet, and people will want it if it is good. Some people say, "If you don't pick it when it's ripe, it will rot." I think it is dangerous to pick melons before they are ripe. He believes that public representatives should not be withdrawn, which is not conducive to production, but some specific problems need to be solved. Whether it is worthwhile to send a public representative to every small enterprise is also worth considering. Yao Mingding said: The bourgeoisie should not overestimate their progress.

Yao Mingding, Director of the Hangzhou Municipal Industrial and Commercial Transformation Guidance Office, focused on expressing his views on the current issue of evaluating the progressiveness of the bourgeoisie. He said that the bourgeoisie is currently transitioning to laborers, but they have not completely gotten rid of the status of exploiters and still maintain a fairly complete capitalist ideological system. Specifically, it is manifested in the following four aspects: 1. They yearn for socialism, but they also miss capitalism; 2. They admit that the bourgeoisie must be eliminated, but when it comes to their own problems, they have regrets; they hope to take off their hats, but they are afraid of ideological transformation; 3. They express their willingness to accept the leadership of the working class and also have the desire to obtain the glorious title of the working class, but they look down on the working class and public representatives; 4. They have technology and require others to respect them, but they are unwilling to give full play to their role. He said that after the high tide, the bourgeoisie has made certain progress, but it should not be overestimated. Overestimating will paralyze themselves and cause them to lose their way, which is not good for work or transformation.

The eleventh speaker was Hui Wujiang, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Industrial and Commercial Research Office of the China National Democratic Construction Association. He believes that it is too early to withdraw the public representatives now, and the conditions are not yet ripe. Dai Desong criticizes the Changsha Municipal Party Committee United Front Work Department for discriminating against the Federation of Industry and Commerce.

He believes that the system of public representatives should not be denied because the public representatives have shortcomings.

Dai Desong, Deputy Secretary-General of the Changsha Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce, said that the Federation of Industry and Commerce is a joint organization of industrialists and businessmen. In the past seven years, the Federation of Industry and Commerce has played a certain role in the socialist transformation work, but many units believe that the Federation of Industry and Commerce has no role and is an organization that is dispensable, and they arbitrarily issue orders to the Federation of Industry and Commerce. The United Front Work Department of the Changsha Municipal Party Committee had an education plan for a certain period of time, which was never issued to the Federation of Industry and Commerce. We cannot see the documents on transformation measures and have to follow the newspapers. If the newspapers do not publish them, we have no way to deal with them. We raised opinions to the United Front Work Department, and the United Front Work Department said: In the future, we will definitely let you see the documents like private personnel, which means that the Federation of Industry and Commerce is treated like private personnel. The United Front Work Department has an incorrect view of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, let alone other organs. Some universities believe that the Federation of Industry and Commerce is a capitalist organization and do not allow cadres of the Federation of Industry and Commerce to apply for exams. He believes that the implementation of the United Front policy should be carefully examined in this rectification campaign.

Then he said that the issue of public representatives is not whether or not they are needed, but how to

    工商界座谈会上很多人说
    资产阶级的两面性是客观存在
    本报讯　中共中央统战部召开的工商界座谈会于昨日（24日）举行第八次座谈。会上有十三个人发言（其中一个是书面发言），对资产阶级两面性、定息年限和撤不撤公方代表等问题展开讨论。座谈会今天继续进行。
    李师道认为：有公方代表能帮助私方人员发挥积极性
    第一个发言的是长沙市工商改造辅导处副处长李师道。他说：我认为合营企业有公方代表，不但不会阻碍私方人员发挥积极性，而且还能帮助私方人员发挥积极性，原因是一个人的积极性要以思想觉悟为基础，公方代表政治思想水平比私方人员高，看问题比私方人员全面，可以帮助私方人员提高思想觉悟，和正确地处理工作中生活中的问题。另外，企业中不只是公私关系、公私矛盾，私私之间、职工与私方之间也存在矛盾，而后者常常不是私方人员可以解决的。
    他说，当然，有的公方代表是有缺点的，如对私方人员不信任，不让私方人员提意见，对私方人员提的合理化建议不支持等等。但不是所有公方代表全都这样，而且有些问题也要具体分析。如有的私方人员不管自己提的意见正确不正确，只要公方代表不采纳，就认为是不信任，这就不对了。因此，他认为不能因为个别公方代表不好，就要求取消公方代表制度。
    对于如何搞好公私共事关系，他认为首先要加强双方思想教育，其次是建立一些必要的制度，使双方分工明确，使私方人员有职有权。他还建议有关方面结合这次整风，对合营企业公私关系进行一次普遍检查。
    高振声主张取消“公方”“私方”的称呼
    河北省工商联副秘书长高振声表示不同意撤出公方代表；李康年提出的“定息二十年”的建议，不但青年工商业者反对，中年和老年工商业者也反对；资产阶级两面性是客观存在，说工人阶级也有两面性是错误的。
    他认为合营企业有阶级关系，但是，公私双方都是政府任命的，都在党的领导下，共同对生产负责，是厂长的就称厂长，是副厂长的就称副厂长。不要分“公方”“私方”了。因为代表工商界利益的，有工商联，还有董事会。他认为改变这种称呼，可以减少或者缩小公私之间的距离，可以加强私方人员对企业的责任心，也能更好地发挥他们的积极性。
    严谔声批评有些党员干部不了解“长期共存、互相监督”的政策
    上海民建中央委员严谔声首先提出：虽然党早已提出了“长期共存、互相监督”的政策，但目前尚有不少民主党派的人士对这个政策有怀疑，他们不相信能够长期共存，更不相信能够互相监督。原因是一方面有些民主党派人士本身有自卑感。另一方面是下边宣传不够。上海至今还有专业公司经理一级的党员干部不知道我国目前有哪些民主党派。他建议党把“长期共存、互相监督”的政策放在党课中对党员进行教育。
    他说，在民主党派和人民团体中不是要不要共产党员的问题，而是党员的地位如何摆法的问题。他认为民主党派，人民团体不同于企业，在企业中党员是代表党去领导企业。在民主党派和人民团体中，共产党员应该在党与民主党派之间起桥梁作用。过去有些部门对这种关系认识不够，处理不妥当，如有的在发一般行政文件指示时，只发给共产党员个人，而不发给那个党员所在的单位，这样做法是不恰当的。
    他还对公方代表不重视业务学习的现象提出了批评。
    千家驹的发言
    我对资产阶级两面性和赎买政策的看法
    首先声明，我今天不是代表工商行政管理局，而是以私人资格在这里发言的。
    对批发商的改造、税收政策、盈余的分配等工作都有缺点。党员干部有严重的“宁左毋右”思想。
    过去几年，对资本主义工商业的改造工作，是取得了伟大的成绩，但也存在着缺点。由于对资本主义的和平改造是我国新的创造，既无经典著作可以依据，苏联和其他兄弟国家也无先进经验可供参考，错误难免，但成绩是主要的。这种成绩已为全世界所公认，也为我国工商界所承认。
    今天，我不谈成绩，只想谈谈缺点。举例来说，如对批发商的改造，在今天看来，在工作上是有缺点的，如果做得好一些，对我们更有好处。其次，税务机关的税收政策，在利用限制改造中，起了一定的作用，但是，所得税是不够实事求是的。所得税按规定说，有所得才能收税，而且最高税率不能超过34％；事实上，由于剔除不合理开支，往往没有所得也征了税，而且税局盈余与账面盈余相差很大，选典型、选胖子、不选瘦子，虚盈实税，杀鸡求卵的情况，决不是个别的现象。又例如，在执行盈余分配上，许多企业未按私营企业暂行条例二十五条，以及四马分肥的原则执行。许多工作干部往往把政策措施当成客观事物的规律，以主观代替客观。对小工商业者与对待大工商业者，一律看待，有些明明是劳动人民，强加以资产阶级的帽子。对职工、资产阶级出身的干部、职员及青年学生的献股，不问其是否出于自愿，是否本人确实进步，生活来源确不依靠股金，除共产党员外，一律均不接受（最近才稍稍开了一点门，个别的可以接受），这不是实事求是的办法。干部在执行政策时，有“宁左毋右”的思想，他们认为左了不过发生偏差，右了丧失立场，甚至工商行政干部明知偏左，也不敢说。这是相当严重的思想问题。诸如此类等，今天不是检查政策，可以不多谈。
    我今天想谈的，是关于中国民族资产阶级有无两面性，公私共事关系是否同时又是阶级关系，赎买政策应如何理解等几个问题。
    资产阶级正处在消灭过程中，资产阶级思想绝不可能先阶级消灭而消灭。
    其一，关于资产阶级两面性是否存在以及两面性应作怎样解释的问题。首先应问资产阶级今天是否已经完全消灭。我认为八大文件中说，资产阶级“处在消灭过程之中”不等于说已经消灭，如认为已经消灭是不符合事实的。事实是，国家每年还要付出一亿多元的定息，国家对资产阶级分子有生活上和政治上的各种安排和照顾，公私、工私之间还有矛盾，还存在着问题。这些都是客观存在的事实，非任何人主观的产物。现在民族资产阶级客观存在，则资产阶级的思想意识是否可能先阶级消灭而消灭呢？这是不可能的，有物质基础就有上层建筑，有阶级存在就有阶级意识。而且即使资产阶级分子改造成为自食其力的劳动者后，也不等于说资产阶级的残余思想不再存在了，因为思想落后于实际，这是一般的规律。正因为如此，我们才强调思想改造的长期性和必要性。两面性是与工商业者的两重身份相适应的，（在未有两重身份前，也已有两面性，但两面性的内容不同。在新民主主义革命时期，积极一面并不包含社会主义的因素。在社会主义革命时期，它就包括社会主义因素了。当全行业合营后，社会主义因素大大增加了。）全行业合营后，一方面资本家把生产资料交给国家，基本上他已成为国家工作人员，是国家干部，就这一意义说，他已经是一个劳动人民了；但另一方面，他与一般的劳动人民还有所不同，他拿定息，还有生活上的种种照顾（如高薪不减，病假期工资发50％—70％等等，因而还保留资产阶级的身份，这是过渡时期的特殊情况，是客观存在的事实。一方面是劳动者，同时又是资本家，这是他们的社会地位。有工人阶级思想，又有资产阶级思想，这两种思想不断斗争，工人阶级思想不断克服资产阶级思想，这是他们的思想状态。这种两重性是两面性的根源。应该承认：工人阶级的一面正在发展扩大，资产阶级的一面不断缩小以至消灭，最后成为一面性，这是它的发展趋势。但不等于说：现在已没有两面性了。毛主席说，如不承认两面性，是形而上学观点，这种形而上学观点如果胜利，则学习任务没有了……这是不符合绝大多数工商界的愿望的。所谓形而上学观点即唯心主义观点。两面性是什么？归根结底，仍为社会主义一面与资本主义一面。
    资本家说不留恋资本主义，是不符实际的。
    所谓资本主义一面，即指资本主义的思想意识，工作作风、工作方法等等。我们指他们还留恋资本主义是指思想情况，不是指他们还要走资本主义道路。走资本主义道路是根本不可能的了，这一点他们是明白的。现在民族资产阶级是否一点也不留恋资本主义呢？我不是工商业者，不能代表他们来答复。我是小资产阶级出身的知识分子，解放前即学习马列主义，但现在有时看到排队买东西，产品质量降低，或其他种种现实生活中的缺点，也不免想到只要有钱，在资本主义社会想要什么有什么。这种想法虽一瞬即逝，虽明知其为错误，但不时要冒出来，可见留恋资本主义，犹如“见猎心喜”，不是什么不可想像的事。工商业者从资本主义社会出身，习惯于老的一套，说全行业合营后，即脱胎换骨，不留恋资本主义，似乎是不符实际的。有朋友说：“脱胎换骨”这句话要不得，易使人想到下句就是“抽筋剥皮”；孙晓村同志说：为什么下句话不是“超凡入圣”呢？这不是很好一句话吗？我认为，对这句话的理解如果是指破资本主义、立社会主义来说，并没有错，应该如此。这样提法有什么不好呢？
    毕鸣岐同志说：“民族资产阶级把自己的企业交出来，不是简单的问题，这种思想斗争，思想变化的情况，是很多党员同志体会不到的。”的确，民族资产阶级交出企业是经过艰苦的思想斗争，这是他们接受改造的明证，也正因为如此，我们不能设想放弃之后，特别是当遇到一些工作上的困难时，不再存有不堪回首话当年的留恋之感，所谓“合营前小国之君，合营后大国之臣，合并后亡国之民”，不是这种心情的表现吗？同时，我们更不能同意认为民族资产阶级放弃生产资料而毫无留恋，比那赤手空拳的工人更加光荣。这种看法是不正确的。
    李康年主张定息二十年，就是消极性的表现。
    所谓消极一面，即指资本主义一面，它的表现形式是各种各样的，而且各人的程度是不平衡的。但作为一个阶级来说，肯定是存在的。仅就李康年主张定息二十年这一点来说，不就是消极性的一种表现吗？自然，同意李康年的主张的，在工商界中占很少数，这也证明消极性一面今天已不占主要的地位，但不能说这种思想仅是李康年一个人的主张。定息二十年，除了想吃剥削饭吃一辈子的思想以外，同时还包括一个对赎买政策认识错误的问题，这我在后面谈赎买政策时还要谈到。除此以外，例如对于工人阶级领导不服气等等。消极性表现形式有各种各样的不同，而且工商界各人存在的程度也不同，但总的观察，从大量观察，从民族资产阶级作为一个阶级来观察，总还是存在的，（虽然它正在逐步缩小之中，这还需要继续教育），这是客观存在的事实。问题在于既有此客观事实存在，是承认好，还是不承认好。承认有利于改造，还是不承认有利于改造？我认为还是承认好，这不仅符合实事求是的精神，而且有利于改造。不承认等于讳疾忌医，正如毛主席所指出的，这是不符合绝大多数工商界的愿望的。
    资产阶级的两面性和某些工人的保守落后有本质的不同；保守落后的工人决不留恋资本主义。
    有人说，资产阶级有两面性，工人阶级中不也有进步、先进与落后保守的两面性吗，是否一回事呢？不是一回事。资产阶级的两面性是来自资产阶级所特有的阶级本质和这个阶级的思想意识，即对社会主义许多新鲜事物还不习惯，还有抵触情绪，还留恋旧时对企业可以专断专行，过着富裕的剥削生活……等等，总之，来自资本主义的一套。工人阶级有没有落后一面呢？肯定是有的，特别是近几年来工人阶级的队伍日益庞大，不少农民流入城市变成产业工人，农民所具有的保守性，自私自利，爱占小便宜，不遵守劳动纪律等等也带入工人阶级中；同时他们还受资产阶级的思想腐蚀的影响。但无论如何，工人阶级的保守一面决不会是留恋资本主义，决不会是再想替老板做工。所以工人阶级的落后保守一面和资产阶级的消极性性质是有不同的，工人阶级也需教育，也需改造，但决不是“破资本主义”的问题。
    觉得不需要向工人阶级学习的人，骨子里是对工人阶级的领导不服气。
    有人提出，民族资产阶级向工人阶级学习什么？好像说工人阶级缺点多得很，如不爱惜公物，不遵守劳动纪律，自私自利……难道我们还要向它学习吗？又有人说，要说美国资产阶级向苏联工人阶级学习完全同意；可是要中国民族资产阶级向中国工人阶级学习，我却想不通。这里面其实就意味着一个对工人阶级领导不服气的问题。资产阶级向工人阶级学习什么，我认为应该学习工人阶级大公无私、集体主义，纪律性，革命性的优良品质，应该学习他们自食其力的劳动习惯，应该学习社会主义的经营管理方法……总之一句话，学习社会主义。学习工人阶级就是学习工人阶级的立场、观点、方法以及社会主义的经营管理方法。这些都不是抽象的而是具体的东西。有人举出某些企业工人某些缺点，认为中国工人是不值得学习的。显然这是以局部代替全部的片面性观点。为什么不举出一些中国工人阶级的优良高贵品质做例证来学习呢（这种例证也是很多的）？对于某些工人所表现的缺点，我们应该进行教育，站在工商业者立场，就应该本着“团结——批评——团结”的原则相互教育，而不是说：“你看，工人群众也有这些缺点，你要我们向工人阶级学习，难道这些缺点也要向他们学习吗？”这样提出问题，如深入一层去分析，不正是对工人阶级领导不服气的一种表现吗！
    劳资之间有墙，资方应负很大责任。资方把解放以前所作所为想一想，就会心平气和了。
      二、公私关系是否同时又是阶级关系问题？这也是一个客观事实问题，事实存在，不能否定它不存在，主观否定存在也不等于客观不存在。如不存在阶级关系，那就根本不存在公私、工私关系问题了。这次座谈会所反映的一些公私问题也变成无的放矢了。既有此事实存在，承认好还是不承认好？我认为承认好，承认矛盾存在才能解决矛盾；否认矛盾存在，更不能解决矛盾。目前有些工人对赎买政策认识不足，对私方人员采取不正确态度，这是一个教育问题，不是否认阶级关系即可解决。应该承认：劳资双方过去有墙，全行业合营后，这道墙已缩小，正在拆除过程中，但还没有完全拆掉。工商业者应该认识，这道墙所以筑成，资方应负很大责任。今天资方想拆墙，而工人还没有拆，或没有完全拆，这也是很自然的，私方应有耐性。不能设想，百年冤仇一旦可以解开的。我们能否认资本家过去没有剥削过、压迫过工人吗？没有打骂过工人吗？且不说解放后是否对抗性问题，至少不能硬说解放前也不是对抗性的吧！劳资双方长期以来是死对头，今天要变成好同志，这决不是一朝一夕所能做到的。我们工商业者必须有最大的耐性，不怕碰钉子，从工作和生活上去改变职工群众对民族资本家的观感，这难道不是应该的吗？工人同志对私方确有些不大公平的地方，这一方面要加强对职工的教育，但工商业者如把解放前所作所为设身处地想一想，也就会心平气和一些了。
    资产阶级的生产资料本应没收；采取赎买政策是为了使资本家安心改造，安心工作，不是国家还资本家的债。
    第三、是关于赎买政策问题。李康年提议赎买应有二十年才够本，这根本不了解赎买政策的意义。赎买政策体现党和国家和平改造资本主义工商业的方针，这是马列主义创造性的发展，不是修正马列主义。要建设社会主义，必须消灭生产资料的资本主义所有制，这是马列主义的基本原理；苏联采取没收政策，我国历史条件不同，采取赎买政策，方式不同，目标则一。在马列主义者看来，资本家生产资料是剥削所得，为过去剩余价值的积累（指整个资产阶级说，非指个别人说，个别分子可能是劳动积累来的，但经过若干年后，亦早已收回原投资了）。我们要搞社会主义革命，就必须消灭资本主义所有制。本应没收，照理亦可没收，但由于我国民族资产阶级历史条件，我们不采取没收而采取赎买。应该认识，这些生产资料不是天生属于资本家的，而是工人阶级所创造被资产阶级所掠夺去的，现在是物归原主。宪法上保障资本家所有制，但又规定要经过国家资本主义改变为全民所有制，这证明在人民中国，生产资料资本主义所有制并非神圣不可侵犯。国家付给定息，其目的在使资本家可以安心改造，安心工作，就这一点说，定息有其积极的意义。但是现在有些工商界朋友却曲解了赎买的意义，在他们看来，赎买是国家欠了资本家一笔债，由国家分期还清，既然赎买就要赎买到底，否则不如干脆说是没收。李康年提议二十年，还有的说“我们拿定息是共产党要给我们的，是维持政府的面子，为了国际影响。”这些思想都是完全错误的。其错误在于把赎买视为国家欠了资本家一笔债，非还不可；拿定息是理所当然，是光荣的事。这种想法是不利于改造的。因为他们把剥削可耻的根本道理都忘记了，把自己过去学习过的东西也否定掉了。
    其次，赎买从什么时候算起，我认为应从1949年算起，私营企业条例是赎买（虽然有些企业未贯彻），四马分肥也是赎买，定息也是赎买。从私营企业条例到定息七年（1949—1962年）共十四年，这十四年中，企业收回的赎金，有的超过，有的刚好，有的不到，不外这三种情况。如果一个个企业来算，是很困难的。赎买还应把高薪、董事领的干薪等等计算在内。总的来说，经过了十四年，生产资料赎买大体上差不多。政府说七年之后还可以拖个尾巴，这也是从政治上说（不是算细账，算细账不合理，也不可能），即指某些资本家如生活还有困难，可以拖个尾巴，其目的也在于使他安心改造，不必忧虑生活。工商业者应该认识赎买是国家对他们进行改造的一种安排，而不是欠了他们一笔债，非还不可。自然，这种安排也不仅为着资产阶级的利益，同时也为着工人阶级和整个国家的利益。如认为国家欠了他们，定息七年是国家揩了65％的油，占了便宜，这不仅不符合事实（赎买应自1949年算起），而且对工商业者来说，也等于白白学习，这不是破资本主义而是立资本主义了。
    工商联领导上官僚主义严重，希望好好整顿。
    最后，我想对工商联工作提一点意见。工商联过去几年做了不少工作，如反映工商业者的意见，代表他们的合法利益，团结教育资本家，接受改造，组织学习及参加各种爱国运动等等，对改造工作起了一定推动作用，这是好的。但另一方面，也不能不承认他们在代表工商业者的合法利益上，特别在代表中小工商业者的利益上是非常不够的。上层领导人物脱离群众，有话不敢说，不敢争，这当然也有主观和客观两方面的原因，不能全责备工商联，但工商联没有能真正代表工商业的合法利益讲话，领导高高在上，脱离群众的现象是相当严重的。同时在全国工商联机关内还有个别党员干部有严重欺压群众，违法乱纪的行为，从未认真处理，违法乱纪的干部还提了级，对党与非党干部赏罚不明，是非不分。这些都证明工商联领导上的官僚主义是相当严重的，希望通过这次整风，严肃处理。
    希望工商界打破顾虑，尽量批评过去改造工作中的缺点。
    过去工商界顾虑重重，不敢公开表示意见，通过这次争鸣，大家把心里话说出来了，这是好现象，希望工商界朋友打破顾虑，继续鸣放，尽量对过去改造工作中的缺点提出意见。要真正做到争鸣，就要展开争论，展开批评与自我批评，分清是非。有些意见，貌似为资产阶级争合法利益，如否认两面性和主张定息二十年，实质是对改造不利，必须加以批评，这样才对改造有利，对工商界有利。
    王金标说：天津青年工商业者90％不同意延长定息。他还说：公方代表撤不得，撤了矛盾更多
    第五个发言的是天津市第四机械工业公司生产计划科副科长王金标。他着重反映了天津青年工商业者的意见和要求。他说：天津青年工商业者有90％（包括我自己）不同意李康年提出的延长定息二十年的意见。他们非常愤怒，不愿意多扣十三年的帽子。
    他说：天津中小户青年工商业者对放弃定息的要求很迫切，原因是解放几年来，他们在党的教育下，认识到剥削的可耻；全行业合营后，他们中绝大部分都得到了很好的安排，生活有了保证；他们知道自己要在社会主义社会生活的时间是很长的，不愿当资本家被人歧视。但是，他们这种诚恳的要求不但没有人支持，还有人说他们是假积极，想钻空子，享受劳保。有人因此对政府不满，产生悲观失望情绪。他希望政府认真考虑一下他们的要求，制定一个标准，什么样的才可以摘掉帽子，以便使他们有努力的方向。
    他说：公方代表撤不得，撤出去是可怕的，不撤虽然有矛盾，但撤出以后矛盾会更多，私方人员会更没有办法，更加苦闷。他认为公私关系不正常，只要双方都采取积极态度是可以解决的。
    最后，他对目前合营企业公方代表出去开会时间过多，无暇掌握生产等问题提了批评。
    北京市工商研究处副处长萧心一的发言，主要是反映工商联与民建会的工作关系问题。他认为目前工商联与民建会的分工不明确，工作内容有重复，造成互相抢人、抢工作、抢时间，双方力量相互抵消；而民建会的骨干分子由于常常被工商联拉走，工作处于无人负责状态，以致使干部不安心民建会的工作。他要求统战部帮助他们解决这些问题。金斌统说：
    民主党派干部处于四不管三不像状态
    武汉市民建副秘书长金斌统谈了自己对于赎买政策的认识。他说：资本家的生产资料是从工人身上剥削来的，因此，工人要把生产资料从资本家手中取回是理所当然的。有人把赎买当作等价或不等价的买卖来理解，显然是不适当的。
    他还批评了统战部不关心不重视民主党派的干部，使民主党派干部处于四不管三不像状态。他还反映某些同业公会的主任委员或副主任委员工作没有得到适当安排。谭志清说：资产阶级的两面性是存在的，
          但积极性是主要的
    民主建国会副秘书长谭志清说：目前资产阶级两面性还是存在的，积极一面是主要的，消极一面是次要的。消极的具体表现：动摇、软弱、怕批评，看风使舵，患得患失，个人主义浓厚，留恋豪华生活，希望定息二十年，等等。但是，几年来我们的进步还是很大的，例如学习出勤率到达90％以上，先进分子先进人物日益增加，有些人同工人一起参加劳动竞赛，更加热爱祖国等等都是积极的表现。在国内大规模的阶级斗争基本结束的形势下，当前的主要任务是发展生产而不是阶级斗争，可是，人们的思想常常被旧的理论观点所束缚，习惯于用过去的观点和方法来观察今天的问题，这是对社会主义不利的。
    谈到进一步加强对私改造问题，他认为除了以企业为基点外，应加强对工商联在这方面的工作。王贤镇说：瓜没熟先摘有危险
    福建省工商联副秘书长王贤镇说：资产阶级过去那段历史很长，想要在几年的时间内改造得和工人一样，没有那么简单。
    很多人都说现在已到了瓜熟蒂落的时候了，为什么还不摘？百分之八、九十的人可以先摘，百分之十到二十的人可以慢一些。他认为这样看问题不全面。瓜熟不熟不能只看颜色，还要看味道是香是甜，好了人家才会要。有人说“熟了不摘就要烂了”。我认为，如果没熟先摘有危险。他认为公方代表不应撤出，这对生产不利，但是有些具体问题需要解决。是否每一个小企业都派一个公方代表也值得考虑。姚铭鼎说：资产阶级不要把自己的进步估计过高
    杭州市工商改造辅导处处长姚铭鼎着重对目前资产阶级进步性的估价问题发表了自己的看法。他说，目前资产阶级正在向劳动者过渡，但还没有完全摆脱剥削者的地位，还保持着相当完整的资本主义思想体系。具体表现在以下四个方面：一、向往社会主义，但又留恋资本主义；二、承认资产阶级必须消灭，但联系到切身问题时，又有惋惜情绪；希望摘帽子，又怕思想改造；三、表示愿意接受工人阶级领导，也有取得工人阶级光荣称号的愿望，但又看不起工人阶级和公方代表；四、有技术，要求别人尊重自己，但又不愿充分发挥自己的作用。他说：高潮以后，资产阶级有一定的进步，但不能估计过高，过高了会麻痹自己，会使自己迷失方向，对工作对改造没有好处。
    第十一个发言的是民建会江苏省工商研究处处长惠无疆。他认为现在撤出公方代表未免太早了，条件还不成熟。戴德嵩批评长沙市委统战部歧视工商联
    他认为不能因为公方代表有缺点就否定公方代表制度
    长沙市工商联副秘书长戴德嵩说：工商联是工商业者的联合组织，七年来工商联在社会主义改造工作中起了一定作用，但是许多单位认为工商联没什么作用，是个可有可无的组织，对工商联任意发号施令。长沙市委统战部在一定时期有一个教育计划，从来不发给工商联。我们看不到改造措施的文件，只好照报纸办事，报纸没登，我们就没有办法。向统战部提出意见，统战部说：今后一定让你们和私方人员一样看到文件，这就是说把工商联和私方人员一样看待。统战部对工商联都有不正确的看法，别的机关更不用说了。有的高等学校认为工商联是资本家组织，不准工商联干部投考。他认为：这次整风应该好好检查统战方针执行情况。
    接着他说：公方代表不是要不要的问题，而是如何发挥作用的问题。公方代表在企业里的作用很大，不少私方代表进步很快，这是和公方代表的领导分不开的。今天有人主张撤出公方代表，只是仅仅从他们本身具体条件出发，认为有公方代表在，公私关系就搞不好。他认为这不能作为取消公方代表的依据。有些公方代表是有缺点的，如不明确本身的任务，一来就乱抓、又抓得死，好像什么事非他不行。较多的公方代表没有帮助私方进行改造，私方人员有问题总是交私方代表去处理。现在许多企业形成公方代表管职工，私方代表管私方人员。但是这都不能否定公方代表制度。丘庆铭不同意工商联内部有阶级关系
    全国工商联丘庆铭作了书面发言。他认为，公私双方在合营企业内基本上是社会主义的同志共事关系，但其中仍包含着一定的阶级关系。
    但是这与私营企业内的阶级关系不同，同高潮前采取“四马分肥”办法的合营企业内的阶级关系也不同。不承认合营企业内部仍有阶级关系是不符合实际的；但不去进一步观察目前企业内部的阶级关系变化，也不利于工作。
    他反对定息二十年的主张。他还说，目前有一部分人不考虑人的改造，只是设法从速摘掉帽子，这是不对的。他认为关键在人的改造。因为即使阶级消灭，如果人还没改造过来，阶级矛盾还会存在。
    因此他建议有关部门帮助公方代表进一步加强统战工作；而工商业者也要进一步靠拢党，主动搞好公私共事关系。
    他又说：我不同意工商联内部有阶级关系存在的说法，更不同意认为工商联既有工人阶级，也有资产阶级和小资产阶级，把社会经济成份与社会阶级混淆起来，把问题复杂化的看法。工商联是各类工商业者联合组成的人民团体，它没有谁剥削谁的关系，也没有劳资之间的关系，只有领导和被领导的关系。但是它内部还是有矛盾的。它代表工商业者的合法利益，同时，它也反对违法行为。如果认为工商联内部阶级关系是客观存在，调解阶级关系是工商联的特殊任务，就会使工商联的性质任务发生根本变化。
