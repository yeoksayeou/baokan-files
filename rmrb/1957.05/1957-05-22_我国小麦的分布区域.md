    Distribution Areas of Wheat in China
    China's wheat-producing areas can be roughly divided into the Northern Winter Wheat Area, the Southern Winter Wheat Area, and the Spring Wheat Area.

    The Northern Winter Wheat Area includes the area south of the Great Wall, east of the Liupan Mountains, and north of the Qinling Mountains, Tongbai Mountains, and Huai River, where winter wheat is grown. The Northern Winter Wheat Area is China's main wheat-producing area, accounting for approximately 66% of the country's total wheat acreage (based on 1955 statistics, the same below) and approximately 63% of the total wheat production.

    The Southern Winter Wheat Area includes the area south of the Qinling Mountains, Tongbai Mountains, and Huai River, and east of the Zheduo Mountains, where winter wheat is grown. This wheat area accounts for approximately 22% of the country's total wheat acreage and approximately 22% of the total wheat production.

    The Spring Wheat Area includes the area north of the Great Wall and west of the Liupan Mountains and Zheduo Mountains, where spring wheat is grown. The spring wheat area accounts for approximately 11% of the country's total wheat acreage and more than 13% of the total wheat production.

    北方冬小麦区包括长城以南，六盘山以东，秦岭、桐柏山和淮河以北的种植冬小麦的地区。北方冬小麦区是我国小麦的主要产区，面积约占全国麦田总面积的66％（根据1955年统计，下同），产量约占小麦总产量的63％。
    南方冬小麦区包括秦岭、桐柏山、淮河以南，折多山以东的种冬麦的地区。这个麦区的面积约占全国麦田总面积的22％，产量约占小麦总产量的22％。
    春小麦区包括长城以北，六盘山、折多山以西的种植春小麦的地区。春小麦的面积约占全国麦田总面积的11％多，产量约占小麦总产量的13％以上。
