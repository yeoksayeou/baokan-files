    Revising the Constitution of Independent Malaya
    Malaya Begins Negotiations with Britain
    (Comprehensive report from our newspaper) Xinhua News Agency reported: Secret negotiations between Britain and the Federation of Malaya on the final revision of the Malayan constitution began in London on the 13th.
    When the Chief Minister of the Federation of Malaya, Rahman, arrived in London on the 10th, he said that the purpose of his delegation was to complete the constitution for Malaya, which is scheduled to gain independence on August 31. He said that the outstanding issue was mainly the issue of single citizenship.
    A committee chaired by Lord Reid of Britain has drafted a report on proposed recommendations for the Malayan constitution as a basis for negotiations. However, it is understood that the Government of the Federation of Malaya does not agree with a British proposal that British subjects in Malaya retain "British nationality" or "Commonwealth nationality" after obtaining the nationality of the Federation of Malaya.
    In addition, although Malaya has agreed to remain in the Commonwealth after independence, it is unwilling to accept the Queen of England as its head of state.

    修订独立后的马来亚宪法
    马来亚同英国开始谈判
    本报综合报道　据新华社消息：为最后修订马来亚宪法而举行的英国和马来亚联合邦之间的秘密谈判，13日在伦敦开始举行。
    马来亚联合邦首席部长拉赫曼10日到达伦敦时说，他的代表团的目的是要为订于8月31日获得独立的马来亚完成宪法。他说，悬而未决的问题主要是单一国籍问题。
    由英国的里德勋爵担任主席的委员会已经拟出了关于马来亚宪法建议的报告，作为谈判的基础。但是，据了解，马来亚联合邦政府不同意英国的一项建议，即在马来亚的英国臣民在取得马来亚联合邦国籍以后还保留“英国国籍”或“英联邦籍”。
    此外，马来亚虽然同意在独立后将仍旧留在英联邦内，但是它不愿接受英国女王作为它的元首。
