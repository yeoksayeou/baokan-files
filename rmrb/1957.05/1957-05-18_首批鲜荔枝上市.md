    First Batch of Fresh Lychees on the Market

    (Our Newspaper) This morning, the Beijing Municipal Dry and Fresh Fruit Management Office, in order to meet market needs in a timely manner, dispatched the first batch of fresh lychees, fifty crates totaling over three thousand pounds, from Guangzhou by express delivery on the 13th. They will be available in Beijing markets for consumers to enjoy soon. According to the purchasing agent, this year's lychee harvest is abundant. The Management Office has signed a contract with the Guangdong Provincial Dry and Fresh Fruit Commercial Department for 940,000 pounds of lychees, an increase of 470% compared to the same period in 1956. To ensure the lychees are brightly colored, fragrant, and delicious, and to reduce spoilage, before loading, the freshly picked lychees are first pre-cooled in cold storage (this process blows out the heat contained within the baskets and the lychees themselves) before being loaded into refrigerated trucks.

    首批鲜荔枝上市
    本报讯　北京市干鲜果经营处，为了及时供应市场需要，于13日用快件由广州发出第一批鲜荔枝五十件约三千多斤，即日便可登市与北京消费者见面。据采购员谈：今年荔枝丰产，经营处已与广东省干鲜果商业处签订了九十四万斤的荔枝合同，较1956年同期增加470％。为使荔枝色艳、香甜可口，并降低损耗，在装车前还采取了把采摘下来的新鲜荔枝先放入冷藏库预冷（这样做，可把筐内及荔枝本身所含热度吹出）再装冷车的办法。
