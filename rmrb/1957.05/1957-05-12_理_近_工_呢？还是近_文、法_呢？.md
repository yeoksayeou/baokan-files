Is "Science" Closer to "Engineering" or to "Liberal Arts and Law"?
            Hua Luogeng
    Please allow me to ask a bold question:
   Are "Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry" closer to "Literature, History, Philosophy, etc."? Or are they closer to "Machinery, Electrical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Metallurgy, Water Conservancy, etc."?
    I think an engineering college seems inseparable from "mathematics, physics, and chemistry," while "literature, history, philosophy..." seem far removed from "mathematics, physics, and chemistry."
    However, our comprehensive universities are basically "liberal arts, science, and law" combined, while engineering colleges only have mathematics and physics teaching and research groups. This has caused, or will cause: difficulties in further study for the comrades working in the mathematics and physics teaching and research groups of engineering colleges, a feeling of being a guest, or the thought of not being content with their positions. On the other hand, comrades engaged in theoretical (or basic) science lack the stimulation and encouragement of practical problems, thus leading to a tendency to belittle practice and to engage in theory for the sake of theory.
    I subjectively believe that: higher education should have universities that integrate science and engineering, and should also have "liberal arts," "law," "agriculture," "medicine," teacher training and other specialized engineering colleges. "Liberal arts" and "science" integration does not seem to make much sense. Perhaps some people will say that the above view is too "untraditional"! Systems that disagree with my views can be found in the Soviet Union and many Western countries. Yes! But I can only see that the reason they are like this is for historical reasons, not for reasons that are necessarily dictated by the nature of science.
    Of course, I am also well aware that my knowledge is narrow and I understand very little outside of my specialty. Therefore, the above views may be a limited perspective, please forgive my boldness, but I hope to throw out a brick to attract jade, and welcome criticism and suggestions.

### “理”近“工”呢？还是近“文、法”呢？

    “理”近“工”呢？还是近“文、法”呢？
            华罗庚
    请允许我提一个大胆的问题：
   “数学、物理、化学”和“文学、历史、哲学等”接近呢？还是和“机械、电机、土木、冶金、水利等”接近呢？
    我想一个工学院似乎是离不开“数理化”的，而“文史哲……”确似乎和“数理化”离得远些。
    但我们的综合大学却基本可以说是“文理法”综合的大学，而工学院却仅有数学物理的教研组。这造成了或将造成：工学院的数学物理教研组的工作同志进修困难，作客思想，或不安于位的思想，另一方面从事理论（或称基础）科学的工作同志缺少了实际问题的刺戟和鼓励，因而导致出轻视实际及为理论而理论的倾向。
    我主观地以为：高等教育应当有理工综合的大学，同时也应当有“文”、“法”、“农”、“医”、师范及其他专门性质的工学院等，“文”“理”综合似乎是没有什么多大道理。也许有人说以上的看法太不“传统”了！苏联和很多西方国家中都可以找出和我的看法不一致的制度。是的！但我只能看到他们之所以如此是历史上的理由，而不是依科学性质势必如此的理由。
    当然我也深知，我的知识是窄狭的，除我专长以外懂得极少。因此以上的看法可能是一孔之见，请恕我大胆，但希望抛出砖去引得玉来，欢迎批评和指教。
