How Can One "Jump the Gun" Like This?
Why do some industrial departments distribute market-scarce goods as employee benefits within the enterprise? By Tian Lifu

    To alleviate the contradiction between supply and demand of goods and to increase the supply of commodities, the state has adopted many significant measures since the beginning of this year to meet the growing needs of the people for daily consumer goods as much as possible. Under these circumstances, production units should, in principle, do their best to provide more goods to the market and work with other departments to ease the tension in the market supply. But in fact, many production units do not hand over all the goods they produce to the commercial departments to supply the market. It is said that these production units have a "jump the gun" practice of selling a large part of their products to their internal employees at low prices as a kind of welfare.
    Woolen fabric is a commodity in short supply throughout the country, but Renli Woolen Mill, a joint state-private enterprise, and Tianjin Woolen Mill, both producing woolen fabric in Tianjin, disregarded the contract signed with industry and commerce and the joint notification issued at the end of 1956 by the Supply and Marketing Bureau of the Ministry of Textile Industry, the General Export Corporation of Sundries, and the China National Textile Products Corporation regarding the quantity of wool textiles to be supplied in the first quarter of 1957. They insisted on not allocating woolen fabric trial products, remnants, and even over-produced portions to the commercial departments to replenish the market supply. Instead, they distributed them internally for employees to wear or sold them on the market themselves as employee benefits. Renli Woolen Mill once proposed to handle 6,924 meters of woolen fabric on its own, including 3,990 meters of over-produced worsted first-grade products and 2,934 meters of trial new products and remnants. If calculated based on the sales quota allocated to the whole country by the China National Textile Products Corporation in 1957, this quantity would account for 42.6% of Tianjin's average monthly sales volume. According to Hebei Province's sales plan, it would be enough for one and a half months of sales. It is understood that before the Spring Festival this year, the two factories also sold more than 4,400 meters of various woolen fabrics, including all kinds of fine and coarse wool fabrics such as serge, gabardine, navy cloth, and striped flannel of two centimeters or more or even entire rolls, to the garment processing companies and garment stores such as Zhentai, Qingji, Xin Tianjin, and Dasheng without handing them over to the commercial departments. Although the commercial departments have repeatedly consulted with the industrial departments and have successively reported to the relevant higher-level authorities for assistance in solving the problem, the problem has not been solved until now due to the industrial departments' insistence on not handing them over, so that the 1957 industry and commerce purchase and sales contract cannot be signed, affecting the market supply work.
    The phenomenon of various industrial companies in Shanghai using products as employee benefits is also very common. For example, on February 13, the Enamelware Industrial Company sold first-grade washbasins and tea trays, substandard small washbasins, tea trays, spittoons, and covered cups, etc., valued at more than 5,500 yuan, to company employees at 40% below the retail price as welfare; the Rubber Tire Industrial Company sold 1,800 pairs of Warrior convex-concave sneakers, King Kong youth shoes, and women's strap rubber shoes returned from abroad at 10% off the factory price to internal employees, which was 3,500 yuan lower than the market price; hot water bottles were in short supply, but Yonghe Factory, which produced hot water bottles, also sold more than 2,000 defective hot water bottles to internal and related units as welfare in December last year and January this year after obtaining the approval of the superior company. Industrial companies or factories that produce thermos bottles, soap, scented soap, aluminum ware, glassware, etc., also have cases of selling products to internal employees at low prices.
    People can't help but ask, what is the production purpose of the above-mentioned production units? Would they say they don't understand this question? They would disagree a hundred times. So why, when the supply of goods is tight, don't they hand over the limited materials to the commercial departments to supply the market, meet the needs of the people, and increase the state's accumulation? The reasons given by the Tianjin woolen fabric production units for using woolen fabric as employee benefits are: a few thousand meters is not a large quantity and has little impact on the market; employee benefits in industry have become a common practice and are not easy to abolish; the garment industrial company lacks raw materials, and the industry can supply directly without going through commercial channels; remnants, regardless of size, are priced as first-grade whole rolls, and the commercial sector does not agree, etc. Obviously, if they truly valued meeting the needs of the people, then everyone knows that "scarcity makes goods precious," and even a little of the scarce commodity is good; secondly, direct supply from industry to the garment industrial company not only violates the principle of division of labor between industry and commerce, but also is not conducive to regulating the supply of the market, and there are already regulations on this matter; regarding the pricing of remnants, higher authorities stipulated that "it can be determined according to the principle that commercial profits are lower than industrial profits," and the commercial department has already made pricing suggestions based on this, and it is generally higher than in other regions. Even if there are still differences of opinion, they should be resolved through consultation as soon as possible, and the market supply should not be affected as a result. As for saying that employee benefits in industry have become a common practice and are not easy to abolish, it is necessary to clarify whether the leaders underestimated the political awareness of the employees and subjectively believed that it was not easy to abolish? Or is it that after a period of political and ideological education, the employees are backward and do not accept the cancellation? If it is the latter, people cannot help but wonder: in the past few years, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the vast majority of people in all walks of life have raised their awareness. Why can't you persuade the employees in your unit to abandon the "special" employee benefits in order to meet the needs of the broad masses of the people?
    In today's China, when commodity production cannot yet meet the needs of the people, any enterprise department's practice of "special" treatment for its own employees is divorced from the masses of the people, will affect the state's accumulation, and increase the contradiction between supply and demand of goods. Therefore, changing this practice as soon as possible is of very important practical significance.

    岂可如此“捷足先登”
    一些工业部门为什么把市场上缺乏的商品作为职工福利在企业内部进行分配？	田力夫
    国家为了缩小商品供求之间的矛盾，增加商品供应力量，今年以来采取了许多重大措施，以求尽可能地满足人民群众对日用消费品日益增长的需要。在这种情况下，照理生产单位应该尽其所能为市场提供更多的商品，跟其他部门共同努力来缓和市场供应的紧张局面。但事实相反，有不少生产单位并没有把生产出来的商品全部交给商业部门供应市场，据说是这些生产单位有个“捷足先登”的惯例，要把很大一部分产品低价卖给内部职工，作为一种福利。
    呢绒是全国供应不足的商品，而天津两个生产呢绒的公私合营仁立毛织厂和天津毛织厂都不顾工商签订的合同规定，和1956年底中央纺织工业部供销总局、杂品出口总公司、中国纺织品总公司联合下达的关于1957年一季度毛纺织品供应数量的通知中的规定，坚持不把呢绒试制品、零料，甚至超产的部分拨交给商业部门，充实市场的供应力量，而作为职工福利自行分穿或自行在市场上销售。仁立毛织厂即曾提出自行处理的呢绒达六千九百二十四公尺，其中超产的精纺正品三千九百九十公尺，试制新品及零料二千九百三十四公尺，这个数量若以中国纺织品总公司1957年分配给全国的销售指标来计算，要占天津市每月平均销售量的42.6％，若按河北省的销售计划，则够销一个半月。据了解，这两个厂在今年春节前，未交给商业部门而自行卖给所属服装加工公司及振太、庆记、新天津、大生等服装门市部的各种呢绒亦达四千四百余公尺，其中包括二公分以上以至整匹的哔叽、华达呢、海军呢、条花呢等各种精粗纺呢绒。商业部门虽曾再三与工业部门协商，并先后报请上级有关机关要求协助解决，但终因工业部门坚持不拨交，使问题至今不能解决，以至1957年工商包销合同也不能签订，影响对市场的供应工作。
    上海各工业公司把产品作职工福利之用的现象也极普遍。如搪瓷工业公司于2月13日将等级品面盆及茶盘、残次小面盆、茶盘、痰盂、盖杯等计价五千五百余元，低于零售价40％卖给公司职工作福利；橡胶轮胎工业公司将出国退回的回力凹凸球鞋、金刚青年鞋、女带胶鞋共一千八百双，以出厂价九折卖给内部职工，较市场价格要低三千五百元；热水袋货源不足，但生产热水袋的永和厂却在去年12月及今年1月将二千多只次品热水袋，在征得上级公司同意后也卖给内部和有关单位的职工作了福利。其余像生产热水瓶、肥皂、香皂、铝器、玻璃器皿等的工业公司或工厂，也都有把产品低价卖给内部职工的情况。
    人们不禁要问，上述这些生产单位的生产目的究竟是什么？说他们不懂得这个问题吗？他们会提出一百个不同意。那么为什么在商品供应紧张的情况下，不把有限的物资交给商业部门供应市场，满足人民群众的需要，增加国家的积累呢？天津呢绒生产单位把呢绒作为职工福利的理由是：几千公尺数量不多，对市场影响不大；工业职工福利已成惯例，不易取消；服装工业公司原料不足，工业可以不通过商业环节直接供应；零料不论大小统按正品整匹作价，商业不同意等四条。显然，如果他们对满足人民需要是真正重视的话，那么谁都知道，“货缺为贵”，紧张商品有一点也是好的；其次，工业直接供应服装工业公司不仅不符合工商分工的原则，同时，也不利于调剂供应市场，这事早有规定；零料作价问题，上级规定“可根据商业利润低于工业利润的原则确定”，商业部门据此早就提出作价意见，且较其他地区一般为高，即便还有分歧意见，也应及早协商解决，不应该使市场供应因此受到影响。至于说工业职工福利已成惯例，不易取消，这倒要弄清楚，是领导上低估了职工群众的政治觉悟，而主观认为不易取消呢？抑或是经过一番政治思想教育工作之后，由于职工落后而不接受取消呢？如果是后者，人们不免要怀疑：几年来各阶层人民在共产党和人民政府的领导下，绝大多数人民都提高了觉悟，为什么在你们那个单位就不能说服职工，为了满足广大人民的需要，而放弃“特殊”的职工福利呢？
    在今天我国商品生产还不能满足人民需要的情况下，任何企业部门对本单位职工搞“特殊化”待遇的做法，都是脱离人民群众的，都会影响国家积累，增加商品供求之间的矛盾。因此，及早改变这种做法，已具有非常重要的现实意义了。
