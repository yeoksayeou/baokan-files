    Revolutionary Vegetable
    Zhang Yongmei

    "This vegetable saved twenty-six lives of us, and it has contributed to the revolution, so I gave it a name, called Revolutionary Vegetable." – Words of an old guerilla fighter from Hainan Island.

    I “No rice, no soup!” [Note] The little bird sings on the tree. No rice, no soup, the guerrilla team is trapped in the mountains. Walking through every mountain rock, like Shennong tasting all kinds of herbs. Shennong gathered herbs, carrying dry food in his pocket. The guerrillas come back from battle, smelling the fragrance of rice in their dreams. “No rice, no soup!” The little bird sings on the tree.

    II “No rice, no soup!” The little bird falls to the ground. Pecking at a wild vegetable, flapping its wings. No rice, no soup, the guerrillas walk in the mountains. Having tasted all kinds of bitter herbs, they come to the wild vegetable. Pick a wild vegetable and taste it, chewing for quite a while. He is like an eagle, flying to the guerrilla captain. The captain eats the wild vegetable, as if he has won a battle: the earth is the logistics, revolutionary vegetable! Is military food!

    III “No rice, no soup!”
  The little bird spreads its wings and flies.
  A clap of spring thunder,
  The guerrilla team fights back to their hometown.
  In the sound of toasting for victory,
  There is a little bird singing:
  “No rice, no soup!
  No rice, no soup!”…
  [Note] The homonym of a bird’s call in Hainan Island.

    革命菜
    张永枚
    “这种菜救了我们二十六条人命，对革命有功，于是我就给他取了个名字，叫革命菜。”　——一个海南岛老游击战士的话
    一“无米无汤”！〔注〕小鸟唱在树上。无米无汤，游击队困在山上。走遍每一座山岩，像神农氏把百草尝。神农氏采草药，口袋里带着干粮。游击队员们战斗回来，梦中嗅到米饭香。“无米无汤！”小鸟唱在树上。
    二“无米无汤！”小鸟跌落地上。啄着一株野菜，拍着两只翅膀。无米无汤，游击队员走在山上。尝尽百种苦草，来到野菜旁。采一株野菜尝尝，嚼了好些时光。他像一只飞鹰，飞向游击队长。队长吃下野菜，好像打了胜仗：大地是后勤，革命菜！是军粮！
    三“无米无汤！”
  小鸟展翅飞翔。
  一声春雷，
  游击队打回家乡。
  在胜利碰杯的响声中，
  有小鸟在歌唱：
  “无米无汤！
  无米无汤！”……〔注〕海南岛一种鸟的叫声的谐音。
