Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 20th. After visiting China and Indonesia, Chairman Voroshilov arrived in Hanoi, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, today. He is visiting Vietnam at the invitation of Chairman Ho Chi Minh.

Chairman Ho Chi Minh and other party and government leaders such as Phan Kế Toại, Võ Nguyên Giáp, Tôn Đức Thắng, and Trường Chinh were at the airport to welcome him.

At 9:40 AM, when Voroshilov's plane landed at Gia Lam Airport, the crowd of more than 7,000 people who came to welcome him burst into thunderous cheers. Chairman Ho Chi Minh waved his sun hat frequently at the aircraft window.

After the plane came to a stop, Voroshilov appeared at the cabin door. He first saluted the cheering crowd, and then briskly walked down the steps. The 35-day foreign visit did not bring any fatigue to the 76-year-old Voroshilov. He quickly grabbed the hand of Ho Chi Minh, who came to greet him, and embraced and kissed him tightly. Chairman Ho then shook hands with Rashidov, Yelyutin, Fedin, and others who came with Voroshilov.

After inspecting the guard of honor, Ho Chi Minh took Voroshilov's arm and led him to meet with Vietnamese party and government leaders, foreign envoys, and representatives from all walks of life in the capital who came to welcome him at the airport. Then they walked onto the airport rostrum.

Chairman Ho Chi Minh first expressed a warm welcome to Voroshilov on behalf of the Vietnamese people, the government, and the Labor Party. He said that the Vietnamese people correctly followed the glorious path of the Soviet people, thus achieving the success of the August Revolution of 1945 and the victory of the War of Resistance, and achieved the independence and freedom of North Vietnam. Since the restoration of peace in Indochina, the Soviet Union, China, and other brotherly countries have generously assisted the Vietnamese people in restoring the economy and developing culture. The Vietnamese people are extremely grateful to the Soviet people, the government, and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

Ho Chi Minh continued by saying that the Vietnamese people deeply love the representative of the great Soviet people—Chairman Voroshilov, who has struggled for the party, for the class, for the Soviet people, and for the bright future of mankind throughout his life. Voroshilov's visit to Vietnam will further develop and consolidate the brotherly friendship between the people of Vietnam and the Soviet Union, which will further promote the cause of defending peace in Southeast Asia and the world.

In his speech, Voroshilov thanked Chairman Ho Chi Minh for the invitation and the warm reception from all sectors of Vietnamese society.

He said that he was very excited to see that the friendship between the Soviet and Vietnamese people is developing day by day. In the struggle for peace, democracy, and socialism, the people of the two countries are advancing side by side, closely united, helping and supporting each other.

He said that the foreign policies of the Soviet and Vietnamese countries are aimed at easing international tensions, preventing anyone from launching a new war, and striving for common tranquility so that all countries can coexist peacefully. The people of the two countries advocate disarmament and oppose the use of atomic and hydrogen weapons.

Finally, Voroshilov, on behalf of the Soviet people, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and himself, extended the best congratulations to the heroic Vietnamese people, the fraternal Vietnamese Labor Party, and the Vietnamese Fatherland Front.

Subsequently, Voroshilov, accompanied by Ho Chi Minh, got into a black convertible car and left the airport for the city. Along the way, 150,000 people lined the streets and cheered. This was the most grand reception the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has ever given to a foreign guest.

Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, May 20th. Chairman Voroshilov left Kunming by special plane this morning to visit the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

Chairman Voroshilov arrived at Kunming Airport by car at 8:40 AM. When shaking hands and saying goodbye to the people who came to see him off, he repeatedly thanked the party and government leaders of Yunnan Province for their hospitality. He said, "We ate very well here and slept very well. When we return home, I will definitely gain weight."

Chairman Voroshilov also acceded to the request of the Soviet experts working in Kunming and took a group photo with them at the airport.

When Chairman Voroshilov waved goodbye to the people seeing him off at the cabin door, he asked Xie Fuzhi, the First Secretary of the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, to convey his gratitude to the comrades, and said: "I hope all comrades will work hard and study hard. We will do many good things for mankind."
