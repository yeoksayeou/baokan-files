Xiao Cuihua Says: "I Want to Perform!"
The Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture Ignores Her
(Our Newspaper News) Xiao Cuihua (Yu Lianquan) told our reporter yesterday: "I want to perform!"

Yesterday evening, Xiao Cuihua called the editorial department of this newspaper and asked a reporter to visit her home. She told me: "These past few days, my family has been reading the newspapers to me, and I understand everything. The Party is calling for 'a hundred schools of thought to contend,' which means that we artists should speak our minds completely to help the Party rectify its work style. Please publish my thoughts in the newspaper as well: I want to perform! I know that the audience has missed me very much these past few years; I miss them even more and long to meet them on stage; what I want even more is to pass on my art to the second generation!"

Xiao Cuihua is a famous Peking Opera performing artist, on par with the Four Great Dan Actresses, and has a unique artistic style. She is a Hua Dan (female comic role) performer. Not long after liberation, foot-binding (qiaogong) was abolished, and some of her plays could no longer be performed. Later, the Ministry of Culture's banned plays and the rigid rules in the reform of opera forced her to leave the stage. She said: "For an actor, not being allowed to perform is more painful than death. I started performing on stage at the age of nine and have lived on stage for more than forty years; these five years of being confined at home have been extremely painful."

Xiao Cuihua said: "I have wanted to perform for a long time. Last December, on a very cold day, I went to the Bureau of Culture myself to request to see the director. I didn't see the director, not even a section chief. A comrade Yuan received me and said that the section chief was in a meeting and that she would definitely convey my request to the leadership. After waiting for a few days without any news, I asked Shiwen (her son) to go again. Dealing with the Bureau of Culture is as difficult as seeing 'Du' in 'Fifteen Strings of Cash'! Shiwen went twice and made wasted trips. The third time, he saw a comrade Liu, who replied: 'Make a list!' Isn't this clearly trying to shut me up? Now everyone has joined an organization, where am I going to make a list? Besides, it is precisely because of this difficulty that I want to ask the Bureau of Culture for help."

"But I didn't give up. I believe that Chairman Mao's call for 'let a hundred flowers bloom' will definitely be realized. I placed my hopes on comrade Yuan. If she really reported it upwards, the director would grasp the Party's policy and help me. Not long ago, I met Deputy Director Zhang Menggeng. When he saw me, he said that he had wanted to visit me for a long time but had not had the time. I thought he was going to bring up the matter. However, after saying polite words, he didn't say anything else and didn't mention the matter at all.

"It's been almost half a year, and the Bureau of Culture has ignored my request."

Xiao Cuihua believes that if the Bureau of Culture could help her form a troupe or help her join a troupe with a comparable artistic level to perform together, she could immediately perform the following plays: "Ma Siyuan," "Sitting in the Tower and Killing Xi," "Capturing the Third Son Alive," "Yanmen Pass," "Battle of Wancheng," "Red Plum Pavilion," "Cuiping Mountain," "Picking the Curtain to Tailor Clothes," "Plum and Jade Match," "Flower Field Wrong," "Marriage of Fortune," "Mu Guiying," "Rouge Trial," "A Bolt of Cloth," "Forging Steel Knives," "Hitting Cherries," and other large and small plays, about fifty or sixty in total.

She believes that "Butterfly Dream" can also be performed. She said that this play was ruined during the period of enemy and puppet rule, when it was sung by several Dan actresses along with "Spinning Cotton," adding erotic elements. At that time, it was called "Splitting Cotton." She said: "I am willing to have this play meet the leaders and the audience on stage. Please let everyone judge whether it is selling eroticism or art."

### 筱翠花说：“我要唱戏！”  北京市文化局竟置之不理

    筱翠花说：“我要唱戏！”
    北京市文化局竟置之不理
    本报讯　筱翠花（于连泉）昨天对本报记者说：“我要唱戏！”
    昨天晚上，筱翠花打电话到本报编辑部，约记者到他家里去。他对我说：“这几天，家里人给我念报，我心里全明白了。党号召‘百家争鸣’，就是要我们艺人把心里话全说出来，帮助党整好风。请你把我的心里话也在报上登一登吧：我要唱戏！我知道这几年观众很想念我；我更想念他们，渴望在舞台上同观众见面；我更想的是，要把自己的艺术传授给第二代！”
    筱翠花是著名的京剧表演艺术家，与四大名旦齐名，在艺术上独树一帜。他是花旦。解放不久，废止跷工，他的一部分戏随之不能演出；以后，文化部的禁戏和戏曲改革工作中的清规戒律，逼得他离开了舞台。他说：“一个演员，不让他演戏，比死还痛苦。从九岁登台起，在舞台上生活了四十多年；这五年闭门在家，心情实在是苦痛之至。”
    筱翠花说：“我早就想唱戏了。去年12月，一个大冷天，我自个儿跑到文化局去求见局长。没见着局长，连科长也没有见着。一位袁同志接见我，说科长在开会，她一定把我的请求转达给领导上。等了几天，没信息，就叫世文（他的儿子）再去。到文化局办事，跟‘十五贯’里‘见都’一样的难啊！世文去了二次，跑白趟。第三次，见了一位刘同志，回说：‘造册子来！’这不明明是堵我的嘴么？现在人都入了组织，我那去造册子。再说，我正为这困难，才要请求文化局帮助。”
   “我可没死心。我相信，毛主席号召‘百花齐放’，一定会办到。我把希望放在袁同志身上。她要真往上反映了，局长会掌握党的政策，会帮助我。前不久，遇见了张梦庚副局长。他见了我，说，他早就要来看我，一直没空。我想，他要往下说了。可是，说完客气话就没词儿了，压根儿没提那事。
   “快半年了，文化局对我的请求置之不理。”
    筱翠花认为，如果文化局能帮助他组班，或帮他搭入一个艺术水平相当的剧团合作演出，他立即可以演出的戏，有“马思远”“坐楼杀惜”“活捉三郎”“雁门关”“战宛城”“红梅阁”“翠屏山”“挑帘裁衣”“梅玉配”“花田错”“得意缘”“穆桂英”“胭脂判”“一匹布”“打钢刀”“打樱桃”等大小有五六十出。
    他认为“蝴蝶梦”也可以演出。他说这出戏，是敌伪统治时期，被几个旦角演员和“纺棉花”一起唱，加入了色情成分，唱毁了的。那时人称“劈纺”。他说：“我愿意将这出戏，在台上与首长、观众见面。请大家评评，是卖弄色情呢，还是艺术。”
