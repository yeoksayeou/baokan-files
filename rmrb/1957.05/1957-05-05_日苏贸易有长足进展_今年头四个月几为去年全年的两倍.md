Xinhua News Agency, 4th. According to Kyodo News Agency reports, Japan's trade volume with the Soviet Union from January to April this year has almost doubled the total trade volume of last year.

From January to March this year, Japan has already signed contracts with the Soviet Union to import chromium ore, timber, and coal worth a total of $8.29 million. This amount is 1.5 times the total trade volume of $5.5 million between the two countries in 1956.

Kyodo News Agency quoted well-informed sources as saying that Japan is expected to export two herring processing ships worth about $7.2 million and ball bearings worth about $400,000. At the same time, Japanese trading companies are constantly receiving inquiries from the Soviet side about purchasing various Japanese machines. Kyodo News Agency said that the Japanese business community is becoming "increasingly interested" in trade with the Soviet Union.

Japan's trade with the Soviet Union is still subject to embargo restrictions, and Japan's trade volume with the Soviet Union currently accounts for only a small proportion of Japan's total exports.

    日苏贸易有长足进展
    今年头四个月几为去年全年的两倍
    新华社4日讯　据共同社报道，日本同苏联在从今年1月到4月期间的贸易额几乎增加为去年全年贸易额的两倍。
    从今年1月到3月，日本已经同苏联订立了从苏联进口价值共达八百二十九万美元的铬砂、木材、煤的合同。这个数额等于1956年两国贸易总额五百五十万美元的一点五倍。
    共同社引消息灵通人士的话说，预料日本将出口价值约为七百二十万美元的两艘青鱼加工船和价值约为四十万美元的滚珠轴承。同时，日本贸易公司还不断接到苏联方面关于购买日本各种机械的询问。共同社说，日本经济界对同苏联贸易“愈来愈感兴趣”。
    日本对苏联的贸易还受着禁运的限制，现在日本对苏联的贸易额在日本出口总额中还只占很小的比重。
