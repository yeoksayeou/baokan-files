Xinhua News Agency, 26th -- The General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army convened a symposium of non-Party senior intellectuals from the Beijing military system from the 22nd to the 25th to solicit their opinions on leadership. Twenty-six people, including engineers, research office directors, professors, and attending physicians, spoke at the symposium.

    At the symposium, many people mentioned that Party member cadres in the army still had distrust, disrespect, and even discrimination and exclusion towards non-Party intellectuals. Some people pointed out that intellectuals are not satisfied with material care but require more concern for their political and technical progress and to feel the warmth of the revolutionary family. Only in this way can “a scholar die for one who understands him.”

    The fact that non-Party intellectuals holding certain leadership positions have the title but no real power was also a common reflection at the symposium. Some people advocated in their speeches that the Party committee should rely on professors (not lecturers or teaching assistants) to run schools, rely on scientists to conduct scientific research, and rely on doctors to run hospitals. Engineers should have the power to make decisions on technical matters.

    Many people criticized the bureaucracy, subjectivism, and sectarianism of the Party organizations and leading cadres in their respective units.

    Bao Wenwei, the director of the French Department of a certain cadre school, said that the leading cadres of the school used the methods of running a middle school to run a university, emphasizing teaching methods and not understanding that middle schools mainly transmit knowledge, while universities should emphasize research. He also talked about the generalization of political work, such as awarding teachers every year based on the number of "five-point" scores obtained by students, which affected the unity among teachers.

    Lü Baowei, the director of a certain research office, criticized the practice of placing a Party member in every leadership position, regardless of whether they were qualified or not. He said that in the minds of many Party members, the masses cannot criticize any of the Party's measures, all levels of Party organizations, or even all Party members, which has created a bad atmosphere of praising merits and being obsequious.

    Senior intellectuals engaged in various different professions also raised some pressing issues that needed to be resolved.

    Engineers generally reflected that there were too many crash tasks and serious waste. Zhuang Zhenwei, an engineer of the Railway Corps, said that the tasks accepted by the Railway Corps were always sudden and often changed. Because there was no time to make adequate construction preparations, construction was often carried out while designing, the quality of technical documents was low, and rework was often carried out, resulting in huge waste of manpower and materials. Lin Naixun, chief engineer of the Air Force Construction Department, also said that the leaders often issued tasks urgently. For example, for a certain 80,000-square-meter building, they were required to draw up two comparative plans overnight, so they could only do a hasty job. Wu Tingyi, an engineer of the Naval Engineering Department, also talked about the fact that his unit did not carry out engineering construction according to regular engineering procedures, often rushing and doing crash work, resulting in poor quality, many accidents, and serious waste.

    Ye Huifang, deputy director of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the 301 Hospital, focused on the unlimited assignment of tasks by the leading organs, making medical personnel busy and often working overtime, which affected the quality of work and physical health. She said that public medical care caused a lot of waste. Those who did not need to be hospitalized were hospitalized, and those who recovered from illness did not leave the hospital (especially family members and nannies of military personnel). Patients asked for aureomycin, streptomycin, and so on. She also said that hospitals in the army system had strong departmentalism, each doing its own thing, with uneven workloads, and suggested unified allocation and use.

    Some people pointed out that the central task of research institutions should be scientific research, and all political movements and political studies should be to strengthen scientific research, but past scientific research work was often interrupted by other work. Many people believe that the current similar research institutions are too scattered and suggest concentrating manpower and material resources. Some people also raised opinions on the excessive proportion of administrative cadres in research institutions, too many non-business activities, and the need to pay attention to the collection of scientific data.

    At the end of the symposium, General Gan Siqi, deputy director of the General Political Department, thanked everyone for speaking from the heart to help the army rectify and said that he would seriously study these opinions. What should be done and can be done will be done quickly and well, and what should be done but cannot be done temporarily or cannot be done completely will also be explained to everyone. He hoped that the people present would cooperate with the army leaders and fully contribute their talents.

    讲出心里话帮助军队整风
    总政治部邀军队系统党外高级知识分子座谈
    新华社26日讯　中国人民解放军总政治部22日到25日召开北京军事系统党外高级知识分子座谈会，征求他们对领导的意见。先后在座谈会上发言的，有工程师、研究室主任、教授、主治大夫等二十六人。
    在座谈会上，许多人提到军队中党员干部对非党知识分子还存在不信任、不尊重以至歧视排斥的现象。有些人提出，知识分子并不满足于生活上的照顾，而是要求更多地关心他们在政治上、技术上的进步，并使他们感到革命大家庭的温暖，唯有如此才能使“士为知己者死”。
    担任一定领导职务的非党知识分子有职无权，也是座谈会上比较普遍的反映。有些人在发言中主张，党委要依靠教授（不是依靠讲师、助教）办学校，依靠科学家办科学研究，依靠医生办医院，工程师应有决定技术问题之权。
    许多人对所在单位党组织和领导干部的官僚主义、主观主义、宗派主义作风提出了批评。
    某干部学校法文系主任鲍文蔚说，学校的领导干部搬用办中等学校的方法来办高等学校，强调教学法，不了解中学主要是传授知识，大学就要强调研究。他还谈到政治工作一般化，如每年根据学生得五分多少来对教员进行评奖，影响了教员之间的团结。
    某研究室主任吕保维，批评各级领导岗位不管称职与否都要放上一个党员的做法。他说，在许多党员的心目中，群众对党的一切措施、各级党组织以至所有党员，都是不能批评的，以致造成一种歌功颂德、唯唯诺诺的不良风气。
    从事各种不同专业的高级知识分子们，还分别提出了一些迫切需要解决的问题。
    工程师们普遍反映突击任务太多，浪费现象严重。铁道兵工程师庄振维说，铁道兵所接受的任务每次都很突然，而且时常变更。由于没有时间作充分的施工准备工作，经常是边设计边施工，技术文件质量低，常常返工，造成人力物力的巨大浪费。空军修建部主任工程师林乃熏也说到领导上下达任务常常急如星火，如某处八万平方公尺的建筑物要求在一夜之间画出两个比较方案来，这样就只能草率应差。海军工程部的工程师吴廷瑮也谈到所在单位不按正规工程程序进行工程建设，经常忙乱突击，造成质量坏、事故多、浪费现象严重的后果。
    三○一医院妇产科副主任叶惠方在发言中着重谈到了领导机关无限制地摊派任务，使医务人员忙乱不堪，时常加班加点，影响工作质量和身体健康。她说，公费医疗造成很大浪费，不需要住院的也住院，病好了不出院（尤其是军队家属和保姆），病人开口就要金霉素、链霉素等。她还说到军队系统的医院有浓厚的本位主义，各搞一套，忙闲不均，建议统一调配使用。
    有些人提出研究机构的中心工作应该是科学研究，一切政治运动和政治学习都应当是为了加强科学研究，而过去的科学研究工作常常被其它工作打断。许多人认为目前同类的研究机构设置太分散，建议集中人力物力。有些人还对研究机构中行政干部所占比重太大、非业务活动太多以及应重视收集科学资料等问题提出了意见。
    在座谈会结束时，总政治部副主任甘泗淇上将感谢大家为了帮助军队整风讲了许多心里话，并表示将认真研究这些意见，应该办又可能办的很快办好，应该办而暂时办不到或不能完全办到的也要向大家作交代。他希望到会的人同军队领导同志合作，把自己的才能充分贡献出来。
