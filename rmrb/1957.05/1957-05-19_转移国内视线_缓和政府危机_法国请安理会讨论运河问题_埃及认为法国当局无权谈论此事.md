Xinhua News Agency Comprehensive Report: The French Mollet cabinet formally requested the United Nations Security Council on the 16th to discuss the Suez Canal issue on the 20th. The United Nations Security Council has, at France's request, scheduled a meeting for May 20th. A French Foreign Ministry spokesperson said on May 17th that France's purpose was not to condemn Egypt, but to have Egypt engage in new negotiations with the Suez Canal user nations. People close to the government said that as soon as this negotiation begins, France may change its attitude of resisting the canal.

Egyptian government spokesperson Hatem commented on this news on May 17th, saying that the French government has no right to discuss the Suez Canal issue, because by invading Egypt, it has openly violated the 1888 Constantinople Convention and the United Nations Charter. Hatem said, "It is no longer a secret that France is raising this issue mainly because of its domestic decline, due to party disputes, and because of the shaky position of its government."

Before requesting the Security Council to discuss the Suez Canal issue, Mollet announced on the 15th that France "cannot accept" Egypt's conditions and once submitted his resignation to President Coty, but quickly withdrew it. These actions came after the National Assembly's Finance Committee passed a motion on the 15th by a vote of thirty-seven to seven, refusing to immediately review the government's proposed tax increase bill. It is well known that in order to solve the financial crisis caused by the Algerian war and the Suez Canal adventure, the government has proposed to the National Assembly to levy 150 billion francs in new taxes and cut 250 billion francs in expenses, and has asked the parliament to hold its thirty-fourth vote of confidence in the government on this proposal.

Parisian public opinion has pointed out that Mollet's sudden hard-line stance on the Suez Canal issue is to divert domestic attention in order to support his government through the crisis.

    转移国内视线　缓和政府危机
    法国请安理会讨论运河问题
    埃及认为法国当局无权谈论此事
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：法国摩勒内阁在16日正式要求联合国安全理事会在20日讨论苏伊士运河问题。联合国安全理事会已经根据法国的要求，将于5月20日举行会议。法国外交部发言人5月17日说，法国的目的不是为了使埃及受到谴责，而是为了要埃及同苏伊士运河使用国进行新的谈判。接近政府的人士说，只要这个谈判一开始，法国就可能改变它抵制运河的态度。
    埃及政府发言人哈特姆5月17日评论这个消息说，法国政府没有权利谈论苏伊士运河问题，因为由于侵略埃及，它已经公开违反了1888年的君士坦丁堡公约和联合国宪章。哈特姆说，“这已不再是秘密，法国之所以提出这个问题主要是由于它国内的衰落，由于党派的纠纷，并且由于它的政府的摇摇欲坠的地位。”
    在向安全理事会要求讨论苏伊士运河问题之前，摩勒在15日宣布法国“不能接受”埃及条件以后一度向戈蒂总统提出辞呈，但是很快就又收回了。这些行动是在国民议会财政委员会15日以三十七票对七票通过拒绝立即审查政府提出的增税法案。大家知道，为了解救阿尔及利亚战争和苏伊士运河冒险所引起的财政危机，政府已经向国民议会提出征收一千五百亿法郎新税和削减二千五百亿法郎开支的建议，并且要求议会就这个提案对政府进行第三十四次信任投票。
    巴黎舆论界纷纷指出，摩勒在苏伊士运河问题上突然摆出强硬姿态是为了转移国内视线，以支撑他的政府渡过危机。
