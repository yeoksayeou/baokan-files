    Treasure Hunt Under the Tower of London
    Seeking Buried Treasure from 300 Years Ago
    Digging Up 17th Century Rubbish
    (Xinhua News Agency dispatch)
    These past two days, a group of people have been busily digging in the earth under the famous Tower of London. They are excavating for treasure, said to be worth 100,000 pounds, buried in a secret vault 300 years ago. Thus, London has become a treasure hunting site, a noteworthy event for the British Empire, which has always enjoyed hunting for treasure in other countries.
    According to legend, during the reign of Cromwell in 17th century England, Baxted, the warden of the Tower of London, seized a large amount of treasure from Royalist prisoners. When Cromwell's regime failed and the monarchy was restored in England, Baxted buried the treasure underground and fled abroad alone. He was soon arrested and executed. The whereabouts of this treasure has remained a mystery ever since. Many people, including King Charles II of England, have tried to find the treasure, but without success.
    Recently, a group of archaeologists employed by the British Ministry of Works used mine detectors to probe the area and found signs of metal underground near the Bell Tower, so they began digging. But so far, they have only dug up some broken bones. According to experts, this is 17th century rubbish.
    Another archaeological team is also excavating near the Tower of London at the same time. Their purpose is to excavate the earthen embankment and wooden palisade in the southwest of the Tower of London from the 11th century.

    伦敦塔下探宝忙
    欲寻三百年前埋藏的财宝
    挖出十七世纪留下的垃圾
    这两天，在伦敦著名的伦敦塔下，一群人在忙忙碌碌地挖掘着土地。他们是在挖掘据说三百年前埋藏在一座秘密地窖中的价值十万英镑的财宝。这样，伦敦已经成为探宝的场所，这是一向喜欢到别国去探宝的大英帝国的一件引人注目的事件。
    根据传说，在十七世纪英国克伦威尔当政的时候，伦敦塔的主管人巴克斯特德从保皇党的犯人那里收刮了大批财宝。当克伦威尔政权失败，君主政体重新在英国恢复的时候，巴克斯特德就把这些财宝埋藏在地下，只身逃亡国外。不久他就被捕处决。这批财宝埋藏在何处，一直是一个谜。有许多人，包括英国国王查理二世在内，曾经试图找寻这批宝藏，但是都没有成功。
    最近，英国工务部聘用的一批考古学家用地雷探测器去探测，发现在钟楼附近地下有金属迹象，于是就开始挖掘。但是到现在为止，他们只挖出了一些碎骨头。据专家说，这是十七世纪的垃圾。
    另一个考古队也同时在伦敦塔附近进行挖掘工作。他们的目的是发掘十一世纪时伦敦塔西南部的土堤和木栅。
