    Some Views and Opinions on the Establishment of the Zhuang Autonomous Region
    Li Weihan

    I would like to offer some views and opinions on the establishment of the Zhuang Autonomous Region. These views and opinions have been mentioned in past discussions and consultations within and outside the Party in Guangxi Province and are now synthesized for further discussion and consultation.

    I. Starting with the Policy of Ethnic Regional Autonomy

    To facilitate the explanation, let's start with a few issues concerning the implementation of the policy of ethnic regional autonomy.

    (1) Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the People's Government has actively promoted the policy of ethnic regional autonomy advocated by the Chinese Communist Party throughout the country. Currently, there are two officially established autonomous regions, thirty autonomous prefectures, and fifty autonomous counties. Thirty-one ethnic minorities have established autonomous areas, with a total population of approximately 22 million, accounting for about 90% of the concentrated minority population in the country that meets the conditions for establishing autonomous areas. The People's Government continues to promote the policy of ethnic regional autonomy, ensuring that minority areas with the conditions for establishing autonomous areas are built into autonomous areas.

    Ethnic regional autonomy is a right that ethnic minorities should enjoy. That is to say, each ethnic minority should have the right to manage its own local affairs. Historically, due to ethnic oppression, the right of ethnic minorities to manage their own affairs was deprived. Implementing ethnic regional autonomy is to return this right to the ethnic minority people. This is a historical task that our people's democratic revolution must accomplish in domestic ethnic relations. Due to the different development conditions of each ethnic minority, it is impossible to establish autonomous areas in a short period. However, this great historical task is nearing completion.

    Ethnic regional autonomy is a major symbol of ethnic equality under our people's democratic system. After the abolition of ethnic oppression, the main content of ethnic equality in politics is that each ethnic minority is the master of its own affairs in the local affairs of its autonomous region. Some people believe that ethnic oppression has been abolished, and all ethnic groups are already equal, so there is no longer a need to implement ethnic regional autonomy. This view is incorrect.

    Ethnic regional autonomy is one of the main symbols of the democratization of our national political life. It enables every ethnic minority to willingly form an ethnic family with the Han and other ethnic minorities, and it is the political foundation for the voluntary union of all ethnic groups into a unified country. Helping ethnic minorities implement regional autonomy can further promote their patriotism.

    Therefore, we often say that ethnic regional autonomy is the basic policy for solving our country's ethnic problems, and it is the key to solving this problem.

    Seven years of experience have proven that the policy of ethnic regional autonomy has been universally and enthusiastically welcomed by ethnic minorities. The democratic reforms and socialist transformations of most ethnic minorities have been completed one after another, and some construction work has been carried out. Their social landscape has fundamentally changed, and their economic and cultural lives have also improved to some extent.

    (2) The autonomous organs at all levels of ethnic autonomous areas have a dual nature: On the one hand, they are local state power organs (people's congresses of autonomous areas) and local state administrative organs. This aspect is their generality, the same as ordinary local state power organs and local state administrative organs. This aspect of the nature of the autonomous organs of ethnic autonomous areas is easy for us to understand and be familiar with. However, there is also its special aspect: It is also a state power organ and a state administrative organ of an ethnic autonomous area, enjoying the autonomous powers granted by the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, which is different from ordinary local state power organs and local state administrative organs. Some Han cadres do not understand or are not familiar with this latter aspect of the nature of the autonomous organs of ethnic autonomous areas. Therefore, it is easy to be overlooked, and in fact, it is often overlooked. Some ethnic minority comrades criticize that the autonomous rights of the autonomous prefectures and autonomous counties in their areas do not match the reality, with more in name than in substance. This is indeed the case and should be changed. The autonomous organs at all levels of autonomous areas should have the right to arrange the local affairs within their autonomous areas, including political life, economic life, and cultural life, according to the characteristics of the local ethnic group and the wishes of the people, without contradicting the Constitution, current political direction of the country, and the unified leadership of the Central People's Government. The implementation of the financial rights of autonomous areas has not been properly resolved, which has affected the realization of various autonomous rights. This is an important shortcoming in our work, which is related to our lack of experience. The drafting of relevant measures for the implementation of this autonomous right is underway, and we should resolve this issue as quickly as possible. Implementation measures also need to be formulated for other aspects of autonomous rights. According to the provision that "the autonomous organs of autonomous regions, autonomous prefectures, and autonomous counties may, in light of the political, economic, and cultural characteristics of the local ethnic groups, formulate autonomous regulations and separate regulations, and submit them to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for approval" (Article 70 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China), the autonomous organs at all levels of autonomous areas, in addition to formulating autonomous regulations, may also formulate separate regulations suitable to the local conditions. They may also formulate supplementary measures or even modified measures suitable to the characteristics of the local ethnic groups for the specific implementation of the state's laws, decrees, resolutions, and orders. In the past, some ethnic areas did this regarding the implementation of the Marriage Law. However, since the promulgation of the Constitution, few autonomous prefectures and autonomous counties have exercised this right. This requires the guidance and support of higher-level state organs for the autonomous organs of autonomous areas to exercise this right. The unified leadership of relevant higher-level state organs over autonomous areas should fully take into account the characteristics of the autonomous areas of each ethnic group, and "should fully guarantee the autonomous organs of each autonomous region, autonomous prefecture, and autonomous county to exercise their right of autonomy" (Article 72 of the Constitution). If the higher-level state organs "unify" the ethnic characteristics and autonomous rights when exercising unified leadership, that is inappropriate and wrong.

    (3) The ethnicization of the organs of autonomous areas is an important component of the policy of ethnic regional autonomy. It is an important condition for realizing the ethnic group's own control and for the autonomous organs and other organs to closely connect with the people. The content of the ethnicization of organs of autonomous areas, in addition to the organizational form of the organs, mainly has two aspects: one is the use of ethnic languages, and the other is the appointment of ethnic cadres.

    Let's first talk about the issue of ethnicization of cadres.

    Over the past seven years, the number of ethnic minority cadres nationwide has increased from more than 10,000 in the first year after liberation to more than 200,000. Each ethnic autonomous area has made great achievements in promoting ethnic cadres and realizing the ethnicization of organs. In the future, we must continue to adhere to the policy of actively cultivating and appropriately promoting ethnic cadres. According to the experience of the past few years, the ethnicization of organs must be combined with the specific conditions of each ethnic autonomous area. The degree, speed, and steps must be suitable for the actual needs and possibilities of each autonomous area in order to be resolved well. The speed and steps of promoting ethnic cadres should mainly be determined by the growth of ethnic cadres. Generally speaking, the policy should be firm, and the steps should be steady. A firm policy means actively cultivating ethnic cadres and helping them grow in all aspects. Steady steps mean promoting cadres with conditions and avoiding "forcing growth." Of course, this does not mean that cadres who should be promoted should not be promoted. Some places, in the process of gradually implementing the ethnicization of cadres, first focus on the arrangement of the former type of organs for organs that are closer to the people and general office organs, county-level organs and prefectural-level organs, autonomous organs and party committee organs; between general cadres and leading cadres, they first focus on the arrangement of leading cadres. This experience can be used for reference. As for the degree of ethnicization of organs, it should mainly be determined by the ethnic relations in each autonomous area. It is not appropriate to generally and mechanically stipulate proportions. The issue here is to consider the population situation, historical situation, and political rights of each ethnic group in the territory. Under the condition of ensuring that the ethnic group implementing regional autonomy can fully exercise its right of autonomy, Han and other ethnic minority cadres should occupy an appropriate and necessary proportion. In some autonomous areas, the Han population accounts for the majority of the population in the territory. In this case, the degree of ethnicization of organs should not be too high, that is, it should not be much higher than the proportion of the ethnic group in the total population of the region. If it is too high, it will affect ethnic unity and the development of the entire autonomous area. In individual autonomous areas with special circumstances, if the Han population is particularly large and the political influence is also very large, the degree of ethnicization of cadres should be based on reality and pay more attention to the needs of ethnic unity and the development of the entire autonomous area. It should not be too high.

    Han cadres, especially Communist Party members among Han cadres, have a major responsibility for helping with the ethnicization of cadres. Han cadres should respect the right of ethnic autonomy and help ethnic cadres grow. They must not be dictatorial, take over everything, impose their will on others, or issue orders. Experience has proven that wherever this is done, the ethnic cadres there can grow healthily; otherwise, the promotion of ethnic cadres will inevitably become a mere formality.

    (4) On the issue of using ethnic languages. The Constitution stipulates that "the autonomous organs of autonomous regions, autonomous prefectures, and autonomous counties use one or more languages and scripts commonly used by local ethnic groups when performing their duties" (Article 71). This provision must be implemented so that the autonomous organs can closely approach and contact the people of the local ethnic groups and facilitate serving them well. Han cadres working in ethnic minority areas and Han cadres working in the autonomous organs and other organs of ethnic autonomous areas should generally also learn the languages and scripts commonly used by local ethnic groups in order to closely contact ethnic minority cadres and local people and serve them. For some ethnic minorities who have independent languages but no script, creating a script is a very important basic construction for them, especially after the country enters a socialist society. If an ethnic group only has language and no script, their cultural development will be greatly and irrevocably limited; conversely, once they have a script representing their ethnic language, it is possible to eliminate illiteracy, develop culture, and absorb advanced and beneficial things from fraternal ethnic groups to enrich their own culture. According to a Zhuang comrade, the Zhuang people welcome Zhuang script more enthusiastically than autonomy. This is understandable.

    Ethnic minorities, especially their cadres and intellectuals, also need to learn Chinese. There are two important reasons for this. The Han nationality accounts for more than 93% of the national population, and the population using Chinese (including ethnic minorities who use Chinese) accounts for more than 95% of the national population. With the development of socialist economy and culture, the scope of use of Chinese will inevitably continue to expand and increasingly become a tool commonly used by all ethnic groups in our country. Learning it will be more conducive to communication and exchanges among ethnic groups, as well as to employment, further education, and scientific research for ethnic minorities. Furthermore, as mentioned above, if ethnic minorities master Chinese, it will be easier to absorb all the beneficial things from Chinese culture to enrich and develop their own culture and quickly improve their cultural level. Of course, this does not mean that Chinese enjoys any special status in our country, so learning Chinese can be regarded as an obligation of ethnic minorities or that they can be forced to learn.

    (5) There is another issue that needs to be noted and considered, which is the construction plan of autonomous areas. I believe that each autonomous area, including autonomous counties, can and needs to formulate its own long-term plan including all aspects based on the state's plan and development direction, combined with the needs and practical possibilities of the local and ethnic groups, and then compile annual plans according to the long-term plan and gradually implement them. As the country is about to enter the second five-year plan period, and most ethnic minorities have basically completed socialist transformation, the need and possibility of formulating construction plans with autonomous areas as units have generally been met. The situation in ethnic minority areas is more complex, and there are many special problems and needs. In order to facilitate solving these problems and appropriately meeting the requirements of ethnic minorities, and to improve the enthusiasm of ethnic minority people to participate in the construction of the motherland, it is necessary for autonomous areas to formulate plans. The higher-level party committees and governments that lead autonomous areas have a necessary to regard helping autonomous areas formulate plans as an important task and provide them with full support from all aspects as much as possible so that they can implement plans and complete plans. However, do not interfere and take over everything. Construction matters for ethnic minorities should be guided for them to arrange themselves. If they do it right, they can learn experience, and if they do it wrong, they can also learn lessons from it. Taking over everything, although completely out of the motivation to help ethnic minorities, often has bad results.

    (6) Let's talk about criticizing Han chauvinism and local nationalism. Han chauvinism exists, and currently, there are mainly three manifestations: one is neglecting the work of ethnic minorities and not caring about the needs of ethnic minorities; the second is disregarding ethnic characteristics and autonomous rights and requiring ethnic areas to follow the rules and regulations of Han areas; the third is being dictatorial, taking over everything, or imposing their will on others and issuing orders in relations with ethnic minority cadres. Local nationalism also exists. It has its generality and its particularity in different ethnic groups, and it needs to be analyzed specifically. At present, the main manifestations of local nationalism among ethnic minorities are: taking a passive attitude or even opposing the elimination of ethnic barriers and the strengthening of ethnic unity; opposing progress and being conservative and backward. Local nationalism in individual ethnic areas is particularly serious and has a tendency of separatism. Reactionary elements in the upper class have used it to do many bad things.

    Han chauvinism is the main danger trend at present.

    Han chauvinism has its long-term historical roots and is not easy to eliminate. The advantage of the Han nationality in terms of population ratio and political, economic, and cultural aspects makes it easier to breed Han chauvinism from within. Han chauvinism often stimulates local nationalism. Wherever there is a certain form of Han chauvinism, there will often be a certain form of local nationalism that goes hand in hand with it. Therefore, generally speaking, we should first and foremost criticize Han chauvinism. Han cadres should set an example in opposing and correcting Han chauvinism to influence ethnic minority cadres to oppose and correct local nationalism in their own ethnic groups.

    However, whether criticizing Han chauvinism or criticizing local nationalism, it should be done after specific and correct analysis. It is necessary to distinguish between right and wrong and importance and lightness, and not take a simple negation method; we must also find out the reasons for it (there are historical reasons and realistic reasons, subjective reasons and objective reasons, etc.), point out the ways to correct it, and educate and help people to correct it. We must not simply criticize it negatively. In particular, we must be realistic and fair, and not indiscriminately attribute everything to Han chauvinism or local nationalism. In that way, not only will they not be criticized, but everyone will be confused, nervous, and timid. For example, respect for the customs and habits of ethnic minorities must be respected. This is a policy and a law. However, can we conclude from this that we should help ethnic minorities to consolidate those harmful components in their customs and habits? We cannot. On the contrary, we also have the responsibility to conduct appropriate propaganda work with them to help them gradually recognize those harmful components and voluntarily reform them. A certain autonomous area once adopted an administrative order to prohibit a certain custom of ethnic minorities that consumed a lot of people's property. This was certainly wrong and should be criticized. However, when the criticism was carried out later, a simple negation method was adopted, simply accusing it of disrespecting the customs and habits of ethnic minorities. Since then, no one dared to talk about helping ethnic minorities improve their customs and habits. For example, ethnic minority cadres should be able to represent the interests and feelings of their own people. If they cannot act as this representative, they will lose contact with their own people and their trust in their own people; at the same time, ethnic minority cadres should correctly, not blindly, represent the interests and feelings of their own people, and strive not to commit local nationalism errors. It is not easy to do the latter. This is not something that can be done simply by saying it. It takes experience and time to learn. Some ethnic minority cadres said that they did not dare to fully and freely reflect the opinions of their own people because they were afraid of being labeled with local nationalism. I believe that on this issue, our requirements for ethnic cadres, especially newly grown ethnic cadres, should first be to let them fully reflect and represent the requirements, wishes, and feelings of their own people, and then help them conduct appropriate analysis and draw correct conclusions. Many Han cadres are afraid of the hat of Han chauvinism, and many ethnic cadres are afraid of the hat of local nationalism. The main reason is the lack of specific analysis. Some ethnic minorities with larger populations also have a tendency of great-ethnic chauvinism in their relations with other ethnic minorities with smaller populations, which also needs to be specifically analyzed.

    II. Two Plans for Establishing the Zhuang Autonomous Region

    The Zhuang ethnic group is the most populous ethnic minority in our country and has a relatively high level of development. The Zhuang people living in Guangxi have a population of about 6.5 million. In December 1952, the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region was established with the areas of Yishan, Baise, and Yongning prefectures, totaling 42 counties; after the promulgation of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, it was reorganized into an autonomous prefecture in 1956.

    Over the past few years, this ethnic autonomous area has achieved due success in many aspects.

    However, judging from the implementation of ethnic regional autonomy nationwide, Mongolia and Uyghur have already established autonomous regions, Tibet has already established an autonomous region preparatory committee, and the Hui nationality is also preparing to establish an autonomous region. The Zhuang nationality must establish a provincial-level autonomous area in order to be compatible with their status in the motherland's family. It is entirely understandable that the Zhuang nationality is not satisfied with the current situation.

    According to the proposal of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Guangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China began to deliberate and discuss the establishment of the Zhuang Autonomous Region within and outside the Party in October last year. In late December, the Third Plenary Session of the Guangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference also took this issue as the main agenda and conducted discussions.

    For the establishment of the Zhuang Autonomous Region, several plans were originally envisioned, among which the main ones are: One plan is to rebuild the entire Guangxi Province into the Zhuang Autonomous Region, which everyone calls the "merger plan." The other plan is to divide Guangxi into two parts, that is, retain the establishment of Guangxi Province, which governs the eastern region of Guangxi Province, roughly including Guilin, Pingle, and Rongxian prefectures and Wuzhou and Guilin cities; another is to delineate the western ethnic minority areas of Guangxi Province, which are mainly inhabited by Zhuang people, to establish the Zhuang Autonomous Region, which governs the areas roughly including Yishan, Baise, and Yongning prefectures and Nanning and Liuzhou cities. Everyone calls this latter plan the "division plan." The vast majority of the enlarged meeting of the Guangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Third Plenary Session of the Guangxi Provincial Committee of the People's Political Consultative Conference, after discussion, agreed with the merger plan (that is, the plan to rebuild the entire Guangxi Province into the Zhuang Autonomous Region) and agreed to name it "Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region." Both plans have their reasons and can be considered. The merger plan involves more complex ethnic relations and class relations, and it seems more difficult to implement; the division plan involves simpler relations, and it seems easier to implement. If only considering that it will be easier for the Zhuang nationality to exercise autonomy in the future, it can be said that the division plan is simpler and easier to implement; if considering the long-term interests of the common development of all ethnic groups in Guangxi, it can be seen that the merger plan has more advantages and is more suitable.

    Both plans are related to the Miao, Yao, Dong, and other ethnic minorities, and their opinions must be seriously solicited. However, from the comparison of the two plans, the most and greatest concern is Han and Zhuang ethnic groups. Therefore, the most involved in the discussion is various situations and problems related to Han and Zhuang ethnic groups. Now, we can talk about some of the more important issues and views that have been discussed.

    (1) The Han people are more than the Zhuang people. This is an important reason for advocating the division plan. The Han people in Guangxi are more than the Zhuang people (the total population of the province is 17,590,000, of which Han people are 10,270,000, accounting for 58.4% of the total population, and Zhuang people are 6,496,400, accounting for 36.9% of the total population), about one and a half Han people to one Zhuang people, which is not a lot. The proportion of Han people in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is even larger, about five Han people to one Mongolian. There are also many autonomous prefectures and autonomous counties in our country where the proportion of Han people is much larger than that of ethnic minorities.

    Some ethnic minorities in our country now live in areas with poor natural conditions. They may not have lived in these places or just lived in these places long ago. Most of them were gradually squeezed into those areas by other ethnic groups, mainly the Han ethnic group, over thousands of years. This fact created by long-term history cannot and should not be restored to its original state today. However, since our country has become a large family of ethnic equality, friendship, mutual assistance, and cooperation, the Han ethnic group, which is in an advantageous position, should try as much as possible to help this part of the ethnic minority people change their isolated, closed, and difficult to develop situation. One of the methods of helping is to appropriately divide a part of the Han people's gathering area into the autonomous areas established by this part of the ethnic minorities according to the local historical and realistic situation, referring to the original administrative divisions, so that it becomes a whole, reducing some restrictions and increasing some favorable conditions for the development of these ethnic minorities; at the same time, respecting the ethnic equality rights of the Han people, and not hindering the development of their political, economic, and cultural lives. The merger plan for the establishment of the Zhuang Autonomous Region, although not completely the same as the above-mentioned situation, is the same in the principle of mutual assistance and common development among ethnic groups. Adopting the merger plan for the establishment of the Zhuang Autonomous Region and implementing it well will definitely have a good impact on the national scope.

    The population of Guangxi Province is not large compared with other provinces in our country. If divided into two units, the population on both sides will be even smaller. If the population ratio and land area are combined for investigation, the reason for the merger plan seems even more sufficient. According to preliminary calculations, the Zhuang people's gathering area accounts for about 60% of the province's area, the Han people's gathering area accounts for about 30%, and the other ethnic minorities' gathering area accounts for about 10%. The area of the Han and Zhuang people's gathering areas is in the opposite contrast with their population ratio. If Guangxi is divided into two units, the map of Guangxi Province will only account for 30% of the existing area, which seems particularly small. Conversely, if the population and land area of both parties are combined, it is just right. Guangxi has developed to this day and has become a whole. From the perspective of water and land transportation and economic development prospects, it is obvious that unity is beneficial and separation is detrimental.

    (2) Historically, Guangxi has been a province since the Yuan Dynasty, with a history of more than 600 years; if calculated from the time when the Lingnan Road was divided into two roads in the Tang Dynasty, it has a history of more than 1,000 years. Some people have investigated that the Han people began to enter Guangxi from the Qin Dynasty, which is calculated to have a history of more than 2,000 years. However, we must not forget: the Han people entered Guangxi later. We must not forget: the history of Guangxi was created by the common labor of the Han, Zhuang, Miao, Yao, Dong, and other ethnic groups in Guangxi, and Guangxi should not be said to be just the history of the Han people. Don't forget: the revolutionary history of Guangxi Han, Zhuang, and other ethnic people fighting together in the past century. The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Movement was launched by the Han and Zhuang people of Guangxi. During the subsequent democratic revolution and socialist revolution, the Han, Zhuang, and other ethnic people of Guangxi insisted on revolutionary struggle together. In the revolutionary struggle, the Han and Zhuang ethnic groups were in an advanced position, united and cooperated with each other, regardless of each other. Historically, we can think that "common labor creation and common revolutionary struggle" are the common traditions of all ethnic groups in Guangxi. Uniting is conducive to carrying forward this common fine tradition. The merger plan has a long historical foundation.

    The merger plan is more in line with the direction of ethnic unity and cooperation. When the Han nationality was the ruling ethnic group in history, and a large number of Han people moved to ethnic minority areas, the Han nationality never suggested to the Zhuang nationality that they should separate and implement autonomy; now that ethnic relations are equal, and no one rules anyone, when the Han nationality needs to help the Zhuang nationality implement regional autonomy, the Han nationality said that they want to separate the family. Is that okay? An agricultural cooperative director asked rightly, "To take the socialist road, we farmers all organize cooperatives. Why does our Guangxi this big cooperative have to separate the family?" Another overseas Chinese relative said, "If they are separated, family members living abroad will definitely suspect that there is discord in the country." Our country's socialist system has basically been established, and the socialist system is the foundation for all ethnic people in our country to further form a solid and unbreakable unity. We believe that as long as we explain it to the people, they will definitely agree to adopt the merger plan and maintain the situation of the Guangxi ethnic family on a new basis.

    (3) From the perspective of socialist construction, especially from the overall situation of Guangxi's industrial construction, separation is unfavorable. For agricultural production, the Han people's gathering area is a better area, but from the perspective of the development prospects of industry and mining, it will not be as good as the conditions in the Zhuang people's area. Guangxi's industrial resources, according to existing data, are mainly distributed in the western Zhuang and other ethnic minority areas; while the Han people have a larger population and higher cultural and technical levels. This requires the Han, Zhuang, and other ethnic groups to be united in a local administrative unit and each use their strengths to jointly build socialism. Guangxi's situation is also a microcosm of the whole country. The total number of ethnic minorities in the country is currently less than 40 million, but the land area they live in accounts for five-thirds of the total area of the country. The Han area has a large population, and the ethnic minority area has a vast territory and abundant resources, which is just right for close cooperation and mutual assistance to build the motherland into a strong socialist industrialized country.

    Some people believe that if the merger plan is adopted, in order to help the construction of ethnic minority areas, a part of the income in the eastern area will inevitably be used in the western area, so the Han people will have opinions; if the division plan is adopted, the central government can directly provide financial assistance to the western area. According to the responsible comrades of the Provincial People's Committee, Guangxi's financial income in the western region has increased year by year in the past few years, and the production potential is large. In the future, this potential will continue to be exploited, and financial income will increase rapidly, so that it will not cause a long-term problem of supplementing the west with the east. I believe that in a certain period, it is completely appropriate and necessary to take out a little material and financial resources from the economically and production-developed Han area to help the ethnic minority areas. Moreover, as far as Guangxi is concerned, both the Han and Zhuang ethnic groups have the responsibility and obligation to help the Miao, Yao, Dong, and other fraternal ethnic groups in the territory economically and financially. We must not ignore this. Of course, the central government should appropriately resolve the financial rights of the entire Zhuang Autonomous Region.

    At present, the financial income of ethnic minority areas nationwide is generally less. In this case, the central government needs to allocate a part of the funds from the state's total income (mainly the income of the Han area) for use in ethnic minority areas. In order for all ethnic groups to transition to socialism and gradually eliminate the de facto inequality between ethnic groups, it is necessary for the Han nationality to provide assistance to ethnic minorities. The Han people should regard helping ethnic minorities develop their economy and culture as their glorious obligation. This also has the significance of "repaying debts" to ethnic minorities, because the Han nationality has been in the ruling ethnic group for a long time in history and owes debts to ethnic minorities. Of course, this debt should be mainly borne by the ruling class of the Han ancestors.

    (4) From the perspective of the development level of the Han and Zhuang ethnic groups, it should be said that they are not very different but quite close. The Han and Zhuang people are both hardworking and brave people and have a common history of revolutionary struggle. They all have a considerable degree of socialist consciousness and are now jointly building socialism. The Communist Party organization established by the advanced elements of all ethnic groups in Guangxi has always been unified, and its history can be traced back to the first domestic revolutionary war period. In the long revolutionary struggle, both the Han and Zhuang ethnic groups have trained a group of communist backbones, and they have also retained some old cadres who have experienced several revolutionary periods. The Zhuang ethnic group is only due to not having its own script. From the perspective of the cultural level of the entire ethnic group, it is lower than that of the Han ethnic group. However, many Zhuang cadres have mastered Chinese.

    Some people are worried that if the merger plan is adopted, the development of culture and education of the Han people will be restricted. This will not happen. Implementing ethnic regional autonomy must develop the economy and culture of all ethnic groups in the autonomous region. The ethnic groups with a higher level of cultural development must continue to improve. It is not right to reduce or stop the development of the higher. It is not feasible in fact. Ethnic groups with a lower level of development must learn from ethnic groups with a higher level of development and catch up with ethnic groups with a higher level of development. Ethnic groups with a higher level of development should pay attention to helping and respecting ethnic groups with a lower level of development and should not discriminate against them.

    Some people are also worried that if the merger plan is adopted and Guangxi is rebuilt into the Zhuang Autonomous Region, the Han people in Guangxi will have to learn the language and script of the Zhuang people, and the Han people will not accept it. This is an overestimation. Article 71 of the Constitution stipulates that "the autonomous organs of autonomous regions, autonomous prefectures, and autonomous counties use one or more languages and scripts commonly used by local ethnic groups when performing their duties." According to this provision and according to the experience of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, if the merger plan is adopted, the languages that should be used in the autonomous region should be Zhuang and Chinese. The formal official documents of the autonomous organs of the autonomous region must use both Zhuang and Chinese, and the newspapers of the autonomous organs of the autonomous region must also be printed in both Zhuang and Chinese. As for the Han area and the printed materials specially for Han people to read, they can of course be printed in Chinese alone. Printed materials specially for Zhuang people to read can also be printed in Zhuang alone. Whether the Han people learn the language and script of the Zhuang people depends on the need and willingness. Han cadres working in ethnic minority areas need to learn the language and script of the local ethnic minorities in order to facilitate close contact with the local people.

    (5) From the above comparison, the division plan is also reasonable and can be considered; but it is not as good as the merger plan, which has more advantages and more sufficient reasons. Therefore, I advocate adopting the merger plan.

    If the merger plan is adopted, there is also a name issue. As mentioned earlier, in the past discussions, the vast majority of people agreed with the merger plan and agreed to use the name "Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region." However, a few people agreed with the merger plan but did not agree with the name "Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region"; some advocated calling it "Guangxi Autonomous Region," some advocated calling it "Guangxi Province Autonomous Region," some advocated calling it "Guangxi Ethnic Autonomous Region," some advocated calling it "Southern Guangdong Autonomous Region," and some advocated calling it "Guangxi Zhuang and Han Autonomous Region." In general, they disagree with putting the word "Zhuang" on the name of the autonomous region. I believe that if the dispute over the name does not involve the substantive issue of Zhuang autonomy, then it should be admitted that "Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region" is a name that matches the reality; conversely, if the name dispute actually involves the substantive issue, then it is better to go back to the substantive issue for discussion. The substantive issue here refers to: first, should the Zhuang nationality establish an autonomous region? Second, should the entire province be merged to establish it, or should it be established separately? Since the Zhuang nationality is implementing regional autonomy, the name cannot but indicate the name of the ethnic group implementing regional autonomy. If the Zhuang nationality does not need to establish an autonomous region, then there is of course no name issue; if the division plan is adopted, there is no issue of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. In our country, the name of an autonomous area is generally composed of three parts: the name of the region, the name of the ethnic group, and the administrative status (region, prefecture, county). If the name of the ethnic group is not indicated, it is impossible to know which ethnic group is implementing autonomy; if the administrative status is not indicated, it is impossible to know which level of autonomous area it is. Is it okay not to include the name of the region? In the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, the name of the region is generally not included. In our country, according to historical and realistic circumstances, the name of the region is included. One is because the place name is what people are used to calling it, the history is very long, and the local people have feelings for it, which should be taken care of. The second is that there are many ethnic minorities in our country who live scattered in several provinces. This situation is also historically formed; in the case of large dispersion and small concentration, it is difficult to distinguish the autonomous areas established separately in several different regions if the place name is not added. Therefore, according to the situation and experience in our country, among the various names mentioned in the past discussions, "Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region" is a common, reasonable, and justifiable name.

    Some people believe that "Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region" and "Tibet Autonomous Region" are the names of regions rather than the names of ethnic groups and are used as reasons for advocating the name "Guangxi Province Autonomous Region" or "Guangxi Autonomous Region." I believe this view is one-sided. Because "Inner Mongolia" and "Tibet" simultaneously represent the names of ethnic groups and the names of regions. If you want to use the example in the name, isn't it very suitable to defend the name "Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region" with the name of "Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region"?

    It should be admitted that in the issue of rebuilding Guangxi into the Zhuang Autonomous Region, the ethnic feelings of the more than 10 million Han people in Guangxi is a problem that needs to be paid attention to. The situation in Guangxi is different from that in Inner Mongolia. Although there are many Han people in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the time they have lived there is not as long as the time the Han people in Guangxi have lived in Guangxi, and their influence there is not as great as the Han people in Guangxi. All ethnic groups have ethnic feelings. If they are not ethnic nihilists, they cannot deny the existence of ethnic feelings. Therefore, when we study the issue of establishing the Zhuang Autonomous Region, we advocate repeated discussions and consultations, listening to the opinions and reflections of all ethnic groups, especially emphasizing the need to pay attention to the opinions and reflections of the more than 10 million Han people in Guangxi. This is in order to appropriately take care of ethnic feelings, especially the feelings of the Han nationality. There is no doubt that all ethnic groups should recognize and respect each other's ethnic feelings. However, people's ethnic feelings are not abstract and cannot all be the same. Ethnic feelings, first, they differ from each other due to different ethnic groups; second, in a society with classes, within

    关于建立僮族自治区问题的一些看法和意见
    李维汉
    我现在就建立僮族自治区问题提供一些看法和意见。这些看法和意见，是以往在广西省党内外讨论和协商中提到过的，现在加以综合，提供大家进行进一步讨论和协商的参考。
    一、从民族区域自治政策谈起
    为了便于说明问题，先从推行民族区域自治政策的几个问题谈起。
    （一）中华人民共和国成立以来，人民政府在全国范围内积极推行了中国共产党所主张的民族区域自治政策，现在，正式建立的民族自治地方，已经有两个自治区，三十个自治州，五十个自治县。建立了自治地方的已经有三十一个少数民族，共约二千二百多万人口，占全国有条件建立自治地方的、聚居的少数民族人口的90％左右。人民政府还在继续推行民族区域自治政策，使有条件建立自治地方的少数民族聚居区都建成自治地方。
    民族区域自治是少数民族应当享有的权利。这就是说，各少数民族应当有权管理本民族的地方性的事务。历史上，由于民族压迫，少数民族自己管理自己的权利被剥夺了；实行民族区域自治，就是要把这种权利交还给少数民族人民。这是我国人民民主革命在国内民族关系上必须完成的历史任务。由于各少数民族的发展情况不同，不可能在一个短时间内都把自治地方建立起来，但是，现在这个伟大的历史任务快要全部完成了。
    民族区域自治是我国人民民主制度下民族平等的主要标志。民族压迫制度废除以后，民族平等在政治上的主要内容，就是各少数民族对于本民族自治地方的地方性的事务实行当家作主。有人认为民族压迫已经废除，各民族已经平等了，就不再需要实行民族区域自治，这种看法是不对的。
    民族区域自治是我们国家政治生活民主化的主要标志之一，它使每一个少数民族愿意同汉族和其他少数民族结成民族大家庭，是各民族自愿联合成为一个统一国家的政治基础。帮助各少数民族实行区域自治，便能更加发扬他们的爱国主义精神。
    所以我们经常说，民族区域自治是解决我国民族问题的基本政策，是解决这个问题的钥匙。
    七年来的经验证明，民族区域自治政策受到了各少数民族普遍的和热诚的欢迎。大部分少数民族的民主改革和社会主义改造已经先后完成，并且进行了某些建设工作，他们的社会面貌根本改变了，他们的经济生活和文化生活也多少有一些改善。
    （二）各级民族自治地方的自治机关具有两重性质：一方面，它是一级地方国家权力机关（自治地方人民代表大会）和地方国家行政机关；这方面是它的一般性，与普通的地方国家权力机关和地方国家行政机关相同。民族自治地方自治机关的这个方面的性质，是我们大家容易了解和熟习的。但是，还有它的特殊性一方面，它又是一级民族自治地方的国家权力机关和国家行政机关，享有中华人民共和国宪法赋予的自治权力，与普通的地方国家权力机关和地方国家行政机关不同。对于民族自治地方自治机关的这后一方面的性质，还有一些汉族干部不大了解，不大熟习；因此容易被忽略，事实上常常有被忽略了的情形。有一些少数民族负责同志批评他们那里的自治州、自治县的自治权利名实不相符，名多实少。确实是有这种情形的，应当切实加以改变。应当使各级自治地方的自治机关对于本自治地方内部的地方性事务，包括政治生活、经济生活和文化生活在内，都有权根据当地民族的特点和人民群众的意愿，在不抵触宪法、不违背国家当前政治方向和中央人民政府统一领导的范围内加以安排。自治地方财政权利的实施还没有适当解决，影响了各项自治权利的实现，这是我们工作中的一个重要缺点，这同我们缺乏经验有关。现在有关这项自治权利实施办法的起草正在进行，我们应当尽可能迅速地解决这个问题。对其他方面的自治权利，也需要规定一些实施办法。根据“自治区、自治州、自治县的自治机关可以依照当地民族的政治、经济和文化的特点，制定自治条例和单行条例，报请全国人民代表大会常务委员会批准”的规定（中华人民共和国宪法第七十条），各级自治地方自治机关除制定自治条例外，还可以制定适合于本地方情况的单行法规；也可以对国家的法律、法令、决议、命令的具体实施制定适合当地民族特点的补充办法以至变通办法。过去，某些民族地区对于婚姻法的实施就是这样做的。但是，宪法颁布以后，各自治州、自治县很少运用这项权利。这需要上级国家机关指导和支持自治地方自治机关来实行这项权利。有关的上级国家机关对自治地方的统一领导，应当充分照顾各民族自治地方的特点，“应当充分保障各自治区、自治州、自治县的自治机关行使自治权”（宪法第七十二条）。如果上级国家机关在实行统一领导的时候，把民族特点和自治权利也“统”掉了，那是不应当的，是错误的。（三）自治地方机关民族化是民族区域自治政策的重要组成部分，是实现本民族当家作主和使自治机关和其他机关密切联系人民的重要条件。自治地方机关民族化的内容，除了机关组织形式外，主要有两个方面：一是使用民族语文，一是任用民族干部。
    先谈谈干部民族化问题。
    七年以来，全国的少数民族干部已经从解放后第一年的一万多人增加到二十万人以上。各民族自治地方在提拔民族干部和实现机关干部民族化方面，已经做出了很大的成绩。今后还要坚持积极培养和适当提拔民族干部的方针。根据几年来的经验，机关干部民族化，必须同各民族自治地方的具体情况相结合，在程度上、速度上和步骤上都要适合于每个自治地方的实际需要和可能，才能解决得好。关于提拔民族干部的速度和步骤，主要应当决定于本民族干部成长的情况。总的说来，方针应当坚定，步骤应当稳重。方针坚定，就是要积极地培养民族干部，从各方面帮助他们成长起来。步骤稳重，就是要有条件地提拔，不要“拔苗助长”。当然，这并不是说应当提拔的干部也不提拔。有些地方在逐步实行干部民族化的过程中，对于比较接近人民群众的机关和一般办公机关，县一级机关和专区一级机关，自治机关和党委机关，先着重前一类机关的安排；在一般干部和领导干部之间，又先着重领导干部的安排。这方面的经验是可以供参考的。至于机关干部民族化的程度，主要应当决定于每个自治地方民族关系的情况，不宜一般地、机械地规定比例。这里的问题是要考虑到境内各民族的人口情况、历史情况和他们的政治权利，在确实保障实行区域自治的民族能够充分行使自治权利的条件下，要使汉族和其他少数民族的干部占有适当的必要的比例。某些自治地方，汉族占境内人口的多数，在这种情况下，机关干部民族化的程度就不宜太高，即不宜比本民族在本区人口总数中所占比例高得太多；太高了，会影响民族团结和整个自治地方的发展。个别情况特殊的自治地方，如果汉族人口特多，政治影响又很大，干部民族化的程度就更要从实际出发，更要注意民族团结和整个自治地方发展的需要，不要偏高。
    汉族干部特别汉族干部中的共产党员，对于帮助干部民族化有重大责任。汉族干部应当很好地尊重民族自治权利，很好地帮助民族干部的成长，决不可独断专行，包办代替，强加于人。经验证明，凡是这样作了的地方，那里的民族干部就能够健康地成长起来；反之，民族干部的提拔就不免流于形式主义。
    （四）关于使用民族语文的问题。宪法规定“自治区、自治州、自治县的自治机关在执行职务的时候，使用当地民族通用的一种或几种语言文字”（第七十一条）。必须实行这个规定，自治机关才能够密切接近和联系当地民族的人民群众，便利于很好地为他们服务。在少数民族地区工作的汉族干部，在民族自治地方自治机关和其他机关工作的汉族干部，一般也应当学会当地民族通用的语言文字，以便密切同少数民族干部和当地人民群众的联系，为他们服务。对于一些有独立语言而无文字的少数民族说来，创造文字是他们一项很重要的基本建设，在国家进入社会主义社会以后，这尤为迫切。一个民族只有语言而无文字，他们的文化发展就要受到很大的不可打破的限制；反之，一旦有了代表本民族语言的文字，就有可能消灭文盲，发展文化，就有可能从兄弟民族方面吸取先进的有益的东西来丰富自己的文化。据一个僮族同志告诉我，僮人群众欢迎僮文比欢迎自治还要热烈，这是可以理解的。
    少数民族人民，首先是他们的干部和知识分子，还需要学习汉语汉文。这有两点重要理由。汉族占全国人口的93％以上，使用汉语汉文的人口（包括通用汉语汉文的少数民族在内）占全国人口95％以上，随着社会主义经济和文化的发展，汉语汉文的使用范围势必继续扩大，而日益成为我国各民族共同使用的工具，学会了它，就更有利于各民族间的交际往来，也有利于少数民族就业、升学以及进行科学研究等等。再则，如同上面说过的，少数民族人民如果掌握了汉语汉文，就更便利于从汉族文化里面吸取一切有益的东西来丰富和发展本民族的文化，更快地提高本民族的文化水平。当然，这决不是说汉语汉文在我国享有什么特权地位，因而可以把学习汉语汉文当作少数民族的义务，可以强迫他们学习。
    （五）还有一个问题，需要加以注意和考虑，这就是自治地方的建设计划问题。我以为各个自治地方包括自治县在内，可以而且需要根据国家的计划和发展方向，结合本地方本民族的需要和实际可能，制定自己的包括各个方面的远景规划，然后依照远景规划，编造年度计划，逐步加以实现。在国家建设即将进入第二个五年计划时期，大多数少数民族已经基本上完成了社会主义改造以后，以自治地方为单位制定建设规划的需要和可能，一般已经具备了。少数民族地区的情况比较复杂，存在着许多特殊的问题和特殊的需要，为了便于解决这些问题和适当地满足少数民族的要求，提高少数民族人民参加建设祖国的积极性，由自治地方制定规划是很必要的。领导自治地方的上级党委和政府，已有必要把帮助自治地方制定规划作为一项重要工作，并且尽可能地从各方面给他们以充分支援，使能实行规划，完成计划。但是，却不要去事事干涉和包办。对少数民族的建设事宜，应当指导他们自己去安排，做对了，他们可以学到经验，做错了，他们也可以从中取得教训。采取包办的方式，虽是完全出于帮助少数民族的动机，结果也常常是不好的。
    （六）再谈谈批判大汉族主义和地方民族主义的问题。大汉族主义是有的，目前主要有三种表现：一是忽视少数民族工作，不关心少数民族的需要；二是无视民族特点和自治权利，要民族地区按照汉族地区的章程办事；三是在同少数民族干部的关系上独断专行，包办代替，或者强加于人、命令行事。地方民族主义也是有的，在不同的民族中，有它的一般性，又有它的特殊性，更需要作具体的分析。目前少数民族中地方民族主义的主要表现是：对消除民族间的隔阂和加强民族间的团结，抱消极态度甚至反对态度；反对进步，保守落后。个别民族地区的地方民族主义特别严重，带有分离主义倾向，上层反动分子利用它作了许多坏事。
    大汉族主义是当前主要的危险倾向。
    大汉族主义有它的长期的历史根源，很不易消除。汉族在人口比重上和在政治、经济、文化上的优势，更易于从本民族内部滋长出大民族沙文主义。大汉族主义常常给地方民族主义以刺激。什么地方存在有某种形式的大汉族主义，往往那里就会存在有同它形影相随的一定形式的地方民族主义。所以，一般地说，我们应当首先和着重地批判大汉族主义。汉族干部应当在反对和纠正大汉族主义方面作出榜样，以影响少数民族干部去反对和纠正他们本民族中的地方民族主义。
    但是，无论批判大汉族主义或者批判地方民族主义，都应当经过具体的正确的分析。要区别开是非轻重，不可采取简单否定的办法；还要找出它的原因来（有历史原因和现实原因，主观原因和客观原因等等），指出改正的办法，教育和帮助人们改正，不可只是消极地批评。特别要实事求是，公平合理，不可以不分青红皂白，什么都归结为大汉族主义或者地方民族主义，那样，不仅批判不掉它们，反而使大家弄得很糊涂，很紧张，束手束脚，胆怯怕事。例如，对少数民族的风俗习惯必须尊重，这是政策，又是法律。但是，可不可以从此得出结论，说我们要帮助少数民族去巩固他们的风俗习惯中那些对本民族有害的成分呢？不可以的。相反，我们还有责任向他们进行适当的宣传工作，帮助他们逐渐地认识到那些有害的成分，自愿地加以改革。某一自治地方，曾经对少数民族的某一种消耗人民财产很大的风习采取行政命令禁止的办法，这当然是不对的，应当批判的。但是，后来进行批判的时候，又采取了简单否定的办法，简单指责为不尊重少数民族的风俗习惯。自那以后，谁也不敢谈论帮助少数民族改良风俗习惯了。又如，少数民族干部是应当能够代表本民族人民的利益和感情的，如果他们不能充当这种代表，就会失去同本民族人民的联系和在本民族人民中的信任；同时，少数民族干部又应当正确地而不是盲目地代表本民族的利益和感情，要力求不犯地方民族主义错误。要做到这后一点很不容易。这不是讲得出就做得到的事情，需要有经验和学习的时间。有一些少数民族干部表示他们不敢充分自由地反映本民族人民的意见，他们害怕这样做了会被扣上地方民族主义的帽子。我以为在这个问题上，我们对于民族干部特别是新成长起来的民族干部的要求，应当首先是让他们充分地反映和代表本民族人民的要求、意愿和感情，然后帮助他们进行适当的分析，得出正确的结论。许多汉族干部怕大汉族主义帽子，许多民族干部怕地方民族主义帽子，主要原因在于缺乏具体的分析。若干人口较多的少数民族在同其他人口较少的少数民族的关系上，也存在有大民族主义倾向，也要进行具体的分析。
    二、建立僮族自治区的两个方案
    僮族是我国少数民族中人口最多的一个民族，发展水平也比较高。居住在广西的僮族，约有人口六百五十万。1952年12月，曾经以宜山、百色、邕宁三个专区共四十二个县的地区，建成桂西僮族自治区；中华人民共和国宪法颁布以后，在1956年改制为自治州。
    几年来，这个民族自治地方的工作在许多方面取得了应有的成绩。
    但是，从全国民族区域自治实施的情况来看，蒙古、维吾尔族都已经建立自治区，西藏已经建立了自治区筹备委员会，回族也准备建立自治区，僮族必须建立一个省一级的自治地方，才能同他们在祖国大家庭中的地位相适应。僮族对现在的情况不满意，是完全可以理解的。
    根据中共中央的倡议，中共广西省委在去年10月开始在党内外酝酿讨论建立僮族自治区的问题。12月下旬，中国人民政治协商会议广西省委员会第三次全体会议，也把这个问题作为主要议程，进行了讨论。
    对于建立僮族自治区，原来设想了好几个方案，其中主要的有两个：一个方案是把广西全省改建为僮族自治区，大家把这称为“合的方案”。另一个方案是把广西划分为两个部分，即保留广西省的建制，管辖现在广西省的东部地区，大体上包括桂林、平乐、容县三个专区和梧州、桂林两个市；另把现在广西省西部僮人为主的少数民族聚居地区划出来建立僮族自治区，管辖的区域大体上包括宜山、百色、邕宁三个专区和南宁、柳州两个市。大家把这后一个方案称为“分的方案”。中共广西省委扩大会议和人民政协广西省委员会第三次全体会议的绝大多数，在经过讨论之后，都赞同合的方案（即把广西全省改建为僮族自治区的方案），并且赞同定名为“广西僮族自治区”。两个方案各有理由，都可以考虑。合的方案涉及的民族关系和阶级关系比较复杂，看起来，比较困难实行；分的方案涉及的关系较为简单，看起来，比较容易实行。如果只是从僮族将来便于行使自治权一点来考虑，可以说分的方案较为简便易行；如果从广西各民族共同向前发展的长远利益来考虑，那就可以看出来，合的方案好处更多，更为适宜。
    两个方案都关涉到苗族、瑶族、侗族和其他少数民族，都必须认真地征求他们的意见。但是，从两个方案的比较来说，关涉最广最大的却是汉、僮两族，所以在讨论中涉及最多的，是同汉族和僮族有关的各种情况和问题。现在，我们可以来谈谈已经讨论到的一些比较重要的问题和看法。
    （一）汉人比僮人多，是主张分的方案的一个重要理由。广西汉族是比僮族人多（全省总人口一千七百五十九万，其中汉人一千零二十七万，占总人口的58.4％，僮族六百四十九万六千四百，占总人口的36.9％），大约一个半汉人比一个僮人，还不算很多。内蒙古自治区汉人占的比重更大，大约五个汉人比一个蒙古人。我国还有不少的自治州、自治县，那里汉人占的比例要比少数民族大得多。
    我国有一部分少数民族人民现在居住在自然条件较差的地区，他们很早以前并不一定是居住在这些地方或者不只是居住在这些地方的，大都是几千年间，其他民族主要是汉族逐渐把他们挤到那种地区里。长期历史造成的这种事实，今天不可能也不应当再恢复原状。但是，我们国家既然成为各民族平等、友好、互助、合作的大家庭，居于优势的汉族就应当尽可能地设法帮助这一部分少数民族人民改变他们所处的孤立的、闭塞的和一时很难有所发展的状态。帮助的方法之一，就是依据当地的历史和现实情况，参照原来行政区划，适当地划一部分汉族聚居的地区到这一部分少数民族所建立的自治地方，使它成为一个整体，为这些少数民族的发展减少一些限制，增加一些有利条件；同时，尊重汉族人民的民族平等权利，不妨碍他们的政治、经济、文化生活的发展。建立僮族自治区采取合的方案，虽然和上述这类情况不完全相同，但是各民族间互相帮助共同发展的道理则是一样的。在建立僮族自治区问题采取合的方案，并把它实行好，一定会在全国范围内产生良好的影响。
    广西省人口和我国其他各省比较起来就不算多，分为两个单位，两边的人口就更加减少了。如果把人口比例和土地面积结合起来加以考察，就显得合的方案理由更为充分。据初步计算，僮族聚居地区约占全省面积60％，汉族聚居地区约占30％，其他少数民族聚居地区约占10％。汉、僮两族聚居地区的面积同他们的人口比例恰成相反的对照。如果把广西分为两个单位，作为广西省的版图，就只占现有面积的30％，就显得特别小。反之，如果把双方的人口和土地面积结合起来，就正是门当户对。广西发展到今天，已经成为一个整体。从水陆交通、经济发展前途等方面看，显然是统一有利，分开不利。
    （二）从历史上看，广西自元代建省以来已有六百多年的历史；如果从唐代划岭南道为东西两道的时候算起，就有一千多年的历史。有人考查过，汉人从秦朝开始进入广西，算起来已有两千多年的历史。但是，我们决不可以忘记：汉人是后来进入广西的。决不可以忘记：广西的历史是广西境内汉、僮、苗、瑶、侗等各族人民共同劳动创造出来的，不应当把广西说成只是汉人的历史。更不要忘记：近百年来广西汉、僮和其他民族人民共同奋斗过来的革命历史。太平天国运动是广西汉、僮两族人民发动的，在以后民主革命时期和社会主义革命时期，广西汉、僮两族人民和其他少数民族人民都在一起坚持革命斗争。在革命斗争中，汉、僮两族都处于先进地位，互相团结合作，不分彼此。从历史上看，我们可以认为“共同劳动创造，共同革命斗争”，是广西各民族共同的传统。合起来，有利于发扬这个共同的优良传统。合的方案有其悠久的历史基础。
    合的方案更符合于民族团结合作的方向。当历史上汉族是统治民族，汉族人民大量移居到少数民族地区的时代，汉族从来没有向僮族提出过建议，让他们分出去实行自治；现在民族关系平等，谁也不统治谁了，正需要汉族帮助僮族实行区域自治的时候，汉族却说要分家，好吗？一位农业合作社主任问得对，他说：“要走社会主义，我们农民都组织合作社，为什么我们广西这个大合作社倒要分家呢？”还有一位侨眷说：“如果分开来，侨居国外的家人一定怀疑国内闹不和。”我国的社会主义制度已经基本上建立起来了，而社会主义制度正是我国各民族人民进一步结成牢固不可破的团结的基础。我们相信，只要向人民讲明白，他们一定会赞同采取合的方案，在新的基础上保持广西民族大家庭的局面。
    （三）从社会主义建设，特别是从广西工业建设的全局着想，分开是不利的。汉族聚居地区，对农业生产说来，是条件较好的地区，但是从工矿业的发展前途说，就会不如僮族地区的条件好。广西的工业资源，据现有资料，主要分布在西部僮族和其他少数民族地区；而汉族的人口较多，文化、技术水平较高。这正需要汉族、僮族和其他各民族联合在一个地方行政单位内，各施所长来共同建设社会主义。广西的这种情况，也正是全国的缩影。全国少数民族人口总数目前不到四千万，他们居住的土地面积却占全国总面积的五分之三。汉族地区人口众多，少数民族地区地大物博，正好彼此亲密合作，互相帮助，把祖国建成一个强大的社会主义工业化的国家。
    有人认为，如果采用合的方案，为了帮助少数民族地区进行建设，势必把东部地区的一部分收入用到西部地区，这样，汉人会有意见；如果采用分的方案，就可以由中央直接对西部地区进行财政帮助。据省人民委员会的负责同志告诉我，几年来广西西部地区的财政收入逐年有增长，生产潜力又大，今后这种潜力将不断被发掘出来，财政收入会迅速增长，不致造成长期地以东补西的问题。我认为，在一定时期内，从经济和生产比较发达的汉族地区拿出一点物力和财力来帮助少数民族地区，是完全应当的，必须这样做的。而且就广西而论，不论是汉族和僮族，都还有责任和义务在经济上和财力上帮助境内苗、瑶、侗等等兄弟民族。我们切不可忽略了这一点。当然，对于整个僮族自治区的财政权利，中央应当予以适当解决。
    目前，全国少数民族地区的财政收入一般是比较少些。在这种情况下，中央需要从国家的总收入中（主要是汉族地区的收入）拨出一部分经费，用在少数民族地区。为了各民族都能过渡到社会主义，并且逐步消除各民族间的事实上的不平等，汉族对少数民族提供帮助是必要的。汉族人民应当把帮助少数民族发展经济、文化看做自己的光荣的义务。这对汉族来说，还带有向少数民族“还债”的意义，因为汉族在历史上长期处于统治民族的地位，对少数民族是负了债的。当然，这种负债，要由汉族祖先的统治阶级负主要责任。
    （四）从汉、僮两族发展水平上看，应当说不是相差很远而是相当接近的。汉、僮两族人民都是劳动勇敢的人民，并且有共同的革命斗争的历史，都有相当程度的社会主义觉悟，现在共同建设着社会主义。由广西各民族中的先进分子建立起来的共产党组织，历来就是统一的，它的历史可以追溯到第一次国内革命战争时期。在长期革命斗争过程中，汉、僮民族都锻炼出一批共产主义的骨干，并且都还保留了一些经历过几个革命时期的老干部。僮族只是由于没有自己的文字，就全民族的文化水平说，比汉族的文化水平要低一些，但是，已有许多僮族干部掌握了汉语、汉文。
    有人担心如果采用合的方案，汉人文化、教育的发展会受到限制。这是不会的。实行民族区域自治，一定要发展自治区内各民族的经济和文化，原来文化水平发展较高的民族还要继续提高，把较高的降低或者停止发展是不对的，而且在事实上也行不通。发展水平较低的民族要向发展水平较高的民族学习，要赶上发展水平较高的民族；发展水平较高的民族要注意帮助和尊重发展水平较低的民族，不可歧视他们。
    还有人担心，如果采用合的方案，把广西改建为僮族自治区以后，便会要广西汉族都学习僮族的语言文字，汉人是不会接受的。这是一种过虑。宪法第七十一条规定：“自治区、自治州、自治县的自治机关在执行职务的时候，使用当地民族通用的一种或者几种语言文字。”依照这个规定，并且按照内蒙古自治区的经验，如果采用合的方案，在自治区内通用的文字应当是僮文和汉文两种，自治区自治机关的正式公文是要使用僮、汉两种文字，自治区自治机关的报纸也用僮、汉两种文字印行。至于汉人地区和专为汉人阅读的印刷品，当然可以单独用汉文印行。专为僮人阅读的印刷品，同样可以单独用僮文印行。汉人学习不学习僮族语言文字，要根据需要和自愿。在少数民族地区工作的汉族干部，有需要学会当地少数民族的语言文字，以便于密切同当地人民群众的联系。
    （五）从以上的比较来看，分的方案也是有理由的，是可以考虑的；但是不如采用合的方案好处更多，道理更充足。因此，我主张采用合的方案。
    如果采用合的方案，还有一个名称问题。前面说过，在以往的讨论中，绝大多数人赞同合的方案，并赞同采用“广西僮族自治区”这个名称。但是也有少数人赞成合的方案，却不赞同“广西僮族自治区”这个名称；有的主张叫“广西自治区”，有的主张叫“广西省自治区”，有的主张叫“广西各族自治区”，有的主张叫“南粤自治区”，也有的主张叫“广西僮、汉自治区”的。总起来说，是不同意在自治区的名称上冠上“僮族”二字。我认为，如果关于名称的争论不涉及僮族自治的实质问题，那么，应当承认“广西僮族自治区”是一个名实相符的称呼；反之，如果名称的争论实际上涉及到实质问题，那么，还是回到实质问题来讨论的好。这里所说的实质问题，指的是：第一、僮族要不要成立自治区？第二、全省合起来成立，还是分开来成立？既然是僮族实行区域自治，在名称上就不能不标明实行区域自治的民族的名称。如果僮族不需要成立自治区，当然不发生名称问题；如果采用分的方案也不发生广西僮族自治区的问题。在我们国家内，自治地方的名称，一般是由地区名称、民族名称和行政地位（区、州、县）三个部分组成的。不标明民族名称，就无法知道是那一个民族在实行自治；不标明行政地位，就无法知道是那一级自治地方。不包括地区名称可不可以呢？在苏联和其他社会主义国家，一般是不包括地区名称的。在我国，根据历史和现实的情况，包括了地区名称。一则因为地名是人们叫惯了的，历史很长，当地人民对它有感情，应当照顾。二则我国有许多少数民族分散居住在若干省份内，这种情况也是历史形成的；在大分散、小聚居的情况下，分别在若干不同地区成立的自治地方，如果不加上地名，就不好辨别。所以，根据我国的情况和经验，在以往讨论中所提到的各种名称里面，“广西僮族自治区”是一个通常的、合理的、站得住脚的名称。
    有人认为“内蒙古自治区”和“西藏自治区”都是地区的名称而不是民族的名称，并用来作为主张采用“广西省自治区”或者“广西自治区”名称的理由。我认为这个看法是片面的。因为，“内蒙古”和“西藏”是同时代表民族名称和地区名称的。要在名称上援例的话，拿“新疆维吾尔自治区”的名称来辩护“广西僮族自治区”的名称，不是很适合么？
    应当承认，在把广西改建为僮族自治区的问题上，广西一千多万汉族人民的民族感情是一个
  需要重视的问题。广西的情况和内蒙古不同，内蒙古自治区内汉人虽然多，但是他们居住在那里的时间不及广西汉人居住在广西的时间长，他们在当地的影响也不像广西汉人在广西那样大。各民族都有民族感情，如果不是民族虚无主义者，就不能否认民族感情的存在。所以在我们研究建立僮族自治区问题的时候，主张反复讨论协商，听取各民族各方面的意见和反映，特别强调要注意到广西一千多万汉族人民的意见和反映。这就是为了要适当地照顾民族感情，特别是汉民族的感情。毫无疑义，各民族对于彼此的民族感情，应当互相承认，互相尊重。但是，人们的民族感情不是抽象的，不可能都是一个样子的。民族感情，第一、它因民族不同而互相区别；第二、在有阶级的社会里，在同一民族内部，它带上不同的社会阶级色彩，因阶级不同而有所不同。单纯按民族感情办事是不行的，要把民族感情放在理智指导之下，加以分析并加以适当处理。应当用民族平等合作大家庭的思想，用社会主义的思想，来指导民族感情，使它不致于成为民族主义。汉族，由于人口众多，政治、经济、文化都比较先进，历史上长期占统治地位，今天更应当主动地去了解和照顾少数民族的心理感情。全国如此，在广西也是如此。汉人在谈到僮族自治的时候，不管是实质问题还是名称问题，不仅要看到汉人的民族感情，还要更多地想到僮人的民族感情。
    至于僮族的族名问题，有人提出现用的“僮”字读音不确切，意思也不大好，应当改一下。我认为这个意见是值得考虑的。“僮族”在僮语中应当叫什么，可以完全由僮族自己做决定。现在所用的汉文“僮”字，可以适当地改换另一个汉字。曾经有人提出可以把“僮”字换为强壮的“壮”字，这个建议可以供参考。
    三、应当妥善处理的几个问题
    如果采用合的方案，以下几个问题要作妥善处理。
    （一）要使僮族实现名实相符的自治。他们根据宪法应当享有的自治权利必须受到充分的尊重。属于僮族内部的事务，应当由僮族人民根据本民族地区的特点，按照自己的意愿当家作主。在僮族地区和在自治机关工作的汉族干部要认真地帮助僮族人民当家作主，不可以包办代替。
    （二）在处理自治区内各民族（包括汉族、僮族、苗族、瑶族、侗族和其他少数民族）间的关系方面，要采取“互相尊重、各得其所、互相帮助、共同发展”的方针。各民族应当互不干涉各民族内部事务，互不强加于人。对于僮族以外的其他少数民族，都要按照民族平等和民族区域自治政策作适当安排。应当建立自治地方而还没有建立的，要逐步建立起来。全区性的事务或者涉及到两个以上民族的事务，要由有关方面先行协商，协商好了再作处理和安排。在自治区制定单行法规或者安排全区工作的时候，应当注意当地各民族人民的意见，事前充分协商。
    （三）从广西各民族的比例关系来说，自治区的自治机关同时带有联合政府的性质。自治区自治机关，要根据广西民族关系的具体情况，使汉族、僮族和其他少数民族的干部都占有相当的必要的地位。
    自治区人民代表大会代表的产生，可以按照现行选举法的规定，以人口为基础，适当照顾各少数民族。因为各民族人民包括汉族人民的选举权利都应当受到尊重，不这样是不合理的。由于汉人在人口中所占的比例大，汉人代表的比重势必也大一些。这样，代表大会在它的工作中就要很好地按照民族区域自治政策来办事，汉族代表要特别注意照顾僮族和其他少数民族的要求和意见。在处理议案和进行选举的时候，都要预先经过充分协商；属于各民族内部的事务，更要尊重各本民族的意见。
    在自治区人民委员会的委员中和正职厅、局长以上的职务中，僮族人员应当占到多大的比例，是一个值得慎重处理的问题。根据广西各民族人口的比例、各民族干部的情况以及有关的历史情况，僮族人员在这些职务中所占的比例，可以相当于50％左右；为了更加有利于民族团结，可以考虑稍低于50％。自治机关中其他工作人员的民族成分，以不规定比例为宜，但是必须注意培养和适当安排僮族干部，以及其他少数民族干部。
    自治区党委和人民团体的领导机关，也要使僮族人员逐步占有适当的比重。
    广西各民族间的人口比例关系，是一个客观存在，而且是长期历史所形成的客观存在，不可能不在广西政治生活上反映出来，并且发生一定的影响。在处理有关的问题上，例如在处理上述各项人事安排的问题上能够适当地顾到这一点，是符合于民族平等原则的，是符合于人民民主原则的，因此是必要的、合理的、有利于民族团结的。
    （四）在居住有少数汉族人口的僮族聚居地区，应当注意使汉族人民在当地人民代表大会和人民委员会有相当的代表名额，并注意提拔汉族干部参加工作。在居住有少数僮族人口的汉族聚居地区，应当注意使僮族人民在当地人民代表大会和人民委员会有相当的代表名额，并注意提拔僮族干部参加工作。在居住有苗、瑶、侗和其他少数民族的汉族和僮族聚居地区，应当特别注意使他们在当地人民代表大会和人民委员会有相当的代表，并注意提拔他们的干部。
    （五）要在自治区国家机关和其他方面，保持统一战线的现有规模；将来随着各方面事业的发展，还可以适当地扩大统一战线的规模。
    （六）对于在自治区工作的汉族干部（包括广西籍和其他省籍的）的作用和成绩要有足够的估计，要继续保持和发扬他们的积极性。对于他们的培养、提拔，要继续按照党和国家的干部政策办事。
    （七）可以考虑在将来的自治区自治条例中，就自治区内民族关系的各项重要问题作出原则性的规定，以便共同遵守。
    （八）要做好充分的准备工作。建立广西僮族自治区，不仅是全广西人民的一件大事，也是全国人民的一件大事，必须做到既能实现名实相符的僮族自治，又能保证巩固各方面的团结特别是汉、僮民族间的团结。这就需要在各方面进行充分的和反复的协商，在全省人民中进行广泛的宣传，在各民族的干部特别在汉、僮两族的干部中做好充分的思想准备，在领导机关并要做好各种必要的实际准备，不要等到临时赶忙。准备时间可以放长些，自治区可以等到1957年省人民代表大会改选的时候成立。争取做到水到渠成，果子熟了再摘，为往后的发展建立良好的开端和基础。
    以上，就是我要说的关于建立僮族自治区问题的一些看法和意见。
