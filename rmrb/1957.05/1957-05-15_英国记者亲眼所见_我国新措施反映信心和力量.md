Xinhua News Agency, 14th dispatch from London: The "Sunday Times" of the 12th published a dispatch from Hong Kong by Richard Hughes, who recently visited China. The dispatch stated that a series of new measures recently implemented by the Chinese government, such as opposing bureaucracy, implementing thrift, establishing free markets, and acknowledging temporary material shortages, "are all being done with determination and truly reflect the power and confidence, rather than weakness and panic, of those in power."

Hughes pointed out that the claims made by American and Chiang Kai-shek newspapers that China is "on the verge of collapse" and facing a "crisis" based on these new measures are "dangerous nonsense."

He said, "China's domestic industrial and material achievements are obvious and undeniable facts." He cited his own observations in Shanghai three months ago as an example, saying, "He, like any visitor, had the opportunity to stand on the roof of the Jinjiang Hotel and see a vast expanse of chimneys, and the suburbs of this six-million-person city under construction with many new power stations and factories - heavy industry to the west, and textile and light industry to the east, and the bright red roofs of newly built houses replacing the old thatched huts."

Hughes said, "Ignoring or denying their achievements is dangerous foolishness." At the same time, he believed in the dispatch that these achievements were a "threat" to Western interests.

    英国记者亲眼所见
    我国新措施反映信心和力量
    新华社14日讯　伦敦消息：12日的“星期日泰晤士报”刊载了最近访问过中国的里查德·休斯从香港发出的一篇通讯，通讯里说，中国政府最近执行的一系列的新措施，如反对官僚主义，实施节约，建立自由市场以及承认物资的暂时的缺乏，“这一切做得都很坚决，确实地反映了当权者的力量和信心，而不是软弱和惊慌。”
    休斯指出，美国和蒋介石报纸根据这些新措施叫喊中国国内“濒临崩溃的边缘”和面临“危机”，这种说法是“一派危险的胡话”。
    他说，“中国国内工业上和物质上的成就是明显的、不容置疑的事实。”他举出他自己在三个月前在上海所看到的情况为例，他说，“他和任何访问者一样，曾有机会站在锦江饭店的楼顶上看到成片的烟囱，看到这六百万人口都市的郊区正在建设着许多新的发电站和工厂——西边是重工业，东边是纺织工业和轻工业，看到新建房屋的鲜红的屋顶代替了陈旧的茅棚。”
    休斯说，“无视或者否认他们的成就是一种危险的愚蠢”。同时他在通讯里认为这些成就是对西方利益的“威胁”。
