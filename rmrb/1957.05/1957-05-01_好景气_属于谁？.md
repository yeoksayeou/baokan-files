	To Whom Does "Good Times" Belong?
	Pei Da
	Recently, a saying has been popular in Japan: "The best economic times since the reign of Emperor Jimmu," meaning that the current Japanese economy has reached an unprecedented level of prosperity. There is some truth to this statement. In the sixty years from Meiji 30 (1897) – when Japan's industrial revolution was basically completed – to the present day, Japanese industrial production has developed by leaps and bounds. In the meantime, the Japanese economy has experienced several periods of recession and prosperity, and today's "good times" are a fact.
	At present, the average index of Japanese industrial and mining production has reached 240% of the pre-war level (with 1934 to 1936 as 100). The development of production has made Japanese monopoly capital very rich. According to a survey by the Nikkei Economic Journal, the profit of 261 companies in the second half of 1955 was 64.2 billion yen, with a profit rate of 39.4%; the profit in the first half of 1956 reached 79.9 billion yen, and the profit rate rose to 43.5%. The shipbuilding industry, which is doing the best business, had a net profit of 2.3 billion yen in the first half of 1956, and the profit rate was almost 100%.
	The "best economic times since the reign of Emperor Jimmu" is actually just a "congratulations on getting rich" greeting from Japanese monopoly capitalists. But the Japanese workers who create wealth have another story to tell. "Japan News Weekly" published a conversation with a single worker, who said: "The food is poor, my stomach is empty, and I often feel dizzy when I work. I sleep until the sun is high on Sundays in order to save on one meal!"
	The development of Japanese industrial production is quite famous internationally. Japan's shipbuilding volume has surpassed that of the United Kingdom, ranking first in the world. However, the low wages of Japanese workers are also surprisingly low among industrialized countries. Even Japanese monopoly capitalists do not deny this. Last spring, the "Japan Federation of Employers' Associations" published a pamphlet entitled "Wage Issues," which stated that, with American workers' wages at 100, Canada was 85%, Britain 52, West Germany 41, France 36, and Japan 29. In reality, the ratio of Japanese workers' wages is clearly exaggerated. According to a survey by the Statistics Bureau of the Japanese Prime Minister's Office in March last year, the average wage of Japanese workers was 12,900 yen, which is actually only equivalent to 10% of the average wage of American industrial workers.
	In recent years, Japanese monopoly capital has done everything possible to promote the "productivity improvement movement" in order to extract more profits from workers, which has led to a rapid increase in labor productivity. With 1951 as 100, by October 1956, the labor productivity of the steel industry was 175%; the coal industry was 151, the electric power industry 233, the shipbuilding industry 182, and the textile industry 183. However, the wage level of workers has stagnated. With 1951 as 100, 1952 was 109.1%, 1953 was 104.8, 1954 was 110.1, 1955 was 106.5, and 1956 showed a downward trend. In the first nine months of that year, it did not reach 100 for six months.
	The result of the monopoly capital's implementation of the lowest wage policy is the inevitable poverty of the workers' lives. This is reflected in the following three aspects: First, there are many people in debt. For example, 66% of coal miners are in debt, 65% of Fuji Iron & Steel workers are in debt, and 90% of Nagasaki port workers are in debt. Second, more and more workers' families are working or engaged in sideline production. In Japanese cities, 45% of families have family members working, and 20% of families are engaged in sideline production. Often late at night, many workers' families can still hear the sound of cheaply rented machines. Third, the proportion of food expenses in wages is increasing.
	Among the 17.2 million workers in Japan, 6.16 million earn less than 8,000 yen a month. Their lives are very difficult; not to mention those with families, even single workers are struggling. In February last year, the Japan National Machinery Workers' Union published a survey report entitled: "This is the Content of an 8,000 Yen Life." A single young worker in his twenties spends 4,000 yen per month on food, 1,500 yen on clothing, 500 yen on health care, 1,000 yen on cultural and recreational activities, and 1,000 yen on other expenses, totaling 8,000 yen. This young man must live in his own home, and if he doesn't have a home, rent and electricity bills become a problem.
	Japan's total labor force is 42 million, of which approximately 12.67 million are unemployed or underemployed. Including their families, it is estimated that approximately 30% of the Japanese population is in a state of poverty. As a result, groups of homeless people roam the streets in big cities. During the day, they scavenge for scraps by garbage dumps, and at night they take shelter under walls or bridges. Near Ueno Park in Tokyo, there are as many as five or six hundred people living on the streets. Among them are men, women, old people, and children, even nursing babies. According to an official survey at the beginning of last year, among these people, two out of every hundred are university graduates and six are vocational school graduates.
	Since the beginning of this year, Japan's industrial and mining production has continued to grow. According to the Japanese national budget, the projected level of industrial and mining production this year is 255.5% of the pre-war level, an increase of 12.5% over the previous year. However, monopoly capitalists do not want to raise workers' wages, and when workers demand a pay increase, the government sends out police to suppress them.
	In capitalist countries, workers are the stepping stones of "good times." According to calculations by Japanese economists, workers at the Mitsui Coal Mine work eight hours a day, of which only two hours and forty-eight minutes are for themselves, and the other five hours and twelve minutes of labor are used to produce profits for the capitalists.

### “好景气”属于谁？

    “好景气”属于谁？
    裴达
    近来，在日本流行着“神武以来的好景气”的说法，意思是说当前日本经济达到了有史以来的繁荣。这种说法确有一面道理。从明治三十年（1897）——日本产业革命基本完成，到今天的六十年间，日本工业生产有了飞跃的发展。在这中间，日本经济曾有几次萧条和繁荣，而今天的“好景气”却是事实。
    目前，日本工矿业生产平均指数，已经达到战前水平（以1934到1936年为一百）的240％。生产的发展，使日本垄断资本发了大财。据日本经济新闻社的调查：1955年下半期，二百六十一个公司的利润额是六百四十二亿日元，利润率为39.4％；1956年上半期的利润额达到七百九十九亿日元，利润率上升到43.5％。生意最好的造船工业，1956年上半期的纯利润是二十三亿日元，利润率几乎达到100％。
    “神武以来的好景气”其实只是日本垄断资本家“恭喜发财”的吉利诺。而创造财富的日本工人却有另外的说法。“日本新闻周报”上登载着一个单身工人的谈话，他是这样说的：“伙食粗劣，肚子空，干起活来常发昏。星期天睡到日当头，为的是节约一顿伙食钱！
    日本工业生产的发展，在国际上是颇为有名的。日本造船量超过了英国，跃居世界第一位。但是，日本工人工资之低，在工业发达的国家里也是出奇的。这连日本垄断资本家也不否认。去年春天“日本经营者团体联盟”发表的小册子“工资问题”上统计，以美国工人工资为一百，加拿大为85％，英国五十二，西德四十一，法国三十六，日本二十九。从实际情况来看，日本工人工资的比数显然是被夸大了。据日本总理府统计局去年3月的调查，日本工人的平均工资是一万二千九百日元，实际上只相当于美国产业工人平均工资的10％。
    近几年来，日本垄断资本为从工人身上榨取更多的利润，千方百计地推行“提高生产率运动”，使劳动生产率迅速上升。以1951年为一百，到1956年10月，钢铁工业劳动生产率为175％；煤炭工业一百五十一，电力工业二百三十三，造船工业一百八十二，纺织工业一百八十三。但是，工人工资水平却呈现停滞状态。以1951年为一百，1952年为109.1％，1953年一百零四点八，1954年一百一十点一，1955年一百零六点五，1956年有下降的趋势，这一年的前九个月之中，有六个月没有达到一百。
    垄断资本实行最低工资政策的结果，工人生活贫困就是必然的了。这表现在以下三个方面：第一，负债的人多。如在煤矿工人中负债的人有66％，富士制铁厂有65％，在长崎港搬运工人中负债的达到90％。第二，工人家属作工或从事副业生产的越来越多。在日本都市中，45％的家庭有家属作工，有20％的家庭进行副业生产。往往在深夜里，许多工人家庭还响着廉价租来的机器声。第三，在工资中伙食费所占的比重越来越大。
    在日本一千七百二十万工人中，每月拿工资八千日元以下的有六百一十六万人。他们的生活是很苦的；有家属的不用说，单身工人也很拮据。去年2月，日本全国机械工会发表了一个调查报告，题目是：“这是八千元的生活内容”。一个二十岁左右的单身青年工人，每月伙食费四千元，被服费一千五百元，保健卫生费五百元，文化娱乐费一千元，其他一千元，共八千元。这个青年要住在自己的家里，如果没有家，房租和电灯电费就成了问题。
    日本全国有劳动力的人口是四千二百万，其中失业和半失业的约有一千二百六十七万。连他们的家属在内，据估计在日本国民中，约有30％的人陷于贫困状态。因而在大都市里，成群无家可归的人流浪街头。白天，他们在垃圾堆边拾破烂，夜晚就在墙根或桥洞里栖身。在东京上野公园附近，露宿街头的就有五、六百人之多。其中，男女老少都有，甚至还有吃奶的孩子。据去年年初的官方调查，这些人里边，每一百人就有两个大学毕业生和六个专科毕业的学生。
    今年以来，日本工矿生产继续增长。根据日本国家预算，预计今年工矿生产水平为战前的255.5％，比前一年度增加12.5％。但是，垄断资本家却不想提高工人的工资，等到工人提出增薪要求时，政府就出动警察加以压制。
    在资本主义国家里，工人是“好景气”的垫脚石。据日本经济学家的计算，三井煤矿工人每天工作八小时，其中只有二小时四十八分钟为自己工作，其它五小时十二分钟的劳动都是为资本家生产利润。
