Collective Farms Across the Soviet Union Launch Competition to Strive for One Quintal of Meat and Four Quintals of Milk per Hectare

    (Our dispatch) In early April, at a conference of agricultural workers in the central black soil regions of the Soviet Union, the speech by Comrade Andreyeva, chairman of the "Communist International" Collective Farm in Michurinsk District, Tambov Oblast, attracted nationwide attention in the Soviet Union. This was because she, on behalf of all members of the farm she led, proposed the socialist competition task of obtaining one hundred quintals of meat and four hundred quintals of milk from every hundred hectares of agricultural land. The specific tasks were: to obtain sixty quintals of meat from every hundred hectares of agricultural land in 1957, one hundred and ten quintals in 1958, and one hundred and seventy quintals in 1960! Such large numbers were unprecedented in the Soviet Union!

    Approximately three years ago, it was considered good if 20-30 quintals of meat could be obtained per 100 hectares of agricultural land. Therefore, the production tasks of the "Communist International" Collective Farm aroused excitement and enthusiasm among farmers throughout the Soviet Union, as it was a major challenge. As a result, many collective farms responded to this challenge and also put forward tasks comparable to those of the "Communist International" Collective Farm.

    On April 23, all farmers in the Chadyr-Lunga District of the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic jointly proposed the task of vigorously increasing meat and milk production. They stated that in order to better welcome the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, they would mobilize all potential to increase the output of livestock products. The competition task they undertook was: this year, the district should produce at least sixty quintals of meat per hundred hectares of land on average, but what is particularly noteworthy is that several advanced collective farms will produce one hundred quintals of meat this year. This is a figure that the entire Soviet people are proud of. This event is of great significance for supporting Andreyeva's initiative and further expanding the competition. Comrade Khrushchev, First Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee, personally sent a letter on behalf of the CPSU Central Committee to the responsible comrades of the Party, government, and Communist Youth League in the Chadyr-Lunga District, as well as to the chairmen of various collective farms and some advanced agricultural workers, congratulating them. Comrade Khrushchev said: "If all collective farms and state farms follow your example and make full use of their potential to expand the production of meat and milk, then the Soviet state will not only be able to fully meet domestic needs for livestock products within one or two years, but will also be able to allocate large amounts of meat and oil for reserves and export." Comrade Khrushchev also said that he believed the initiative of the Chadyr-Lunga District would be echoed by agricultural workers in other regions with similar potential.

    As Comrade Khrushchev predicted, agricultural workers in various regions responded to this initiative of advanced agricultural producers in Russia and Moldavia. The newspapers of April 27 published the news that all collective farms in the Vinnytsia Oblast of Ukraine responded to this challenge. Many collective farms have also undertaken the task of producing one hundred quintals of meat and four hundred quintals of milk per hundred hectares of agricultural land this year. Two collective farms in Cherkasy Oblast led by Heroes of Socialist Labor also participated in this competition, undertaking similar tasks. Comrade Khrushchev, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, wrote congratulatory letters to the two of them and some leading comrades in Vinnytsia Oblast, encouraging them to work hard to complete the tasks they had proposed.

    This competition to strive to maximize the production of meat and milk on every hundred hectares of agricultural land is continuing to expand. This will promote the rapid development of Soviet livestock farming.

### 争取从每公顷地生产一公担肉四公担牛奶  苏联各地集体农庄展开竞赛

    争取从每公顷地生产一公担肉四公担牛奶
    苏联各地集体农庄展开竞赛
    本报讯　4月初，在苏联中央黑土地带各州的农业工作者会议上，唐波夫州米丘林区“共产国际”集体农庄主席安德列耶娃的发言，引起了苏联全国的注意。因为她代表她所领导的农庄的全体庄员，提出要从每一百公顷农业用地获得一百公担肉和四百公担牛奶的社会主义竞赛任务。具体的任务是：1957年从每一百公顷农业用地上要获得六十公担肉，1958年一百一十公担，1960年则为一百七十公担！这样大的数字，在苏联还是创举！
    大约三年前，每百公顷农业用地如果能获得二、三十公担肉就不算少了。因此，“共产国际”农庄的生产任务，引起了全苏农民的激动和热情，这是一个很大的挑战。于是许多农庄响应了这个挑战，也纷纷提出和“共产国际”农庄不相上下的任务。
    4月23日，苏联摩尔达维亚共和国查对尔—隆格区的全区农民一道提出了大力提高肉、奶产量的任务。他们表示，为了更好地迎接十月革命四十周年，要动员一切潜力提高饲畜品的产量。他们承担的竞赛任务是：今年，全区平均在每一百公顷土地上要至少生产六十公担肉，但其中特别值得注意的是，几个先进农庄今年就要生产一百公担肉类。这是全苏人民引为骄傲的数字。这件事对于支持安德列耶娃的创举从而进一步展开竞赛有很重要的意义，苏共中央第一书记赫鲁晓夫同志特代表苏共中央亲自致函查对尔—隆格区的党、政、团的负责同志，以及各农庄主席和一些农业先进工作者们，向他们致贺。赫鲁晓夫同志说：“如果所有的集体农庄和国营农场都效法你们的榜样，充分利用自己的潜力来扩大肉类和牛奶的生产，那么，苏维埃国家在一两年之中就不仅能完全满足国内对饲畜业产品的需要，而且还能拨出大量的肉和油做为储备和出口之用。”赫鲁晓夫同志还说，他相信查对尔—隆格区的倡议一定会受到拥有同样潜力的其他各地农业劳动者的响应。
    正如赫鲁晓夫同志所预料，各地农业工作者纷纷响应了俄罗斯和摩尔达维亚农业先进生产者的这个倡议。4月27日的报纸上，就刊出了乌克兰温尼茨州全部集体农庄响应这个挑战的消息。其中许多集体农庄也都承担了每一百公顷农业用地在今年即生产一百公担肉和四百公担牛奶的任务。切尔卡斯州的两个由社会主义劳动英雄领导的农庄也参加了这个竞赛，承担了类似的任务。赫鲁晓夫同志代表苏联共产党中央给他们二人和温尼茨州的一些领导同志们都写去了贺信，勉励他们努力完成自己提出的任务。
    这项争取在每一百公顷农业用地上尽量提高肉和奶的产量的竞赛，还在继续扩大。这将促使苏联饲畜业的突飞猛进。
