Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 6th - The newly published "Party Life," issue eight's editorial, states that in reforming the management of the national economy, it is necessary to prevent localism, and at the same time, it is imperative to establish leadership methods that rely on the masses.

The editorial, titled "The Party Spirit of Economic Workers," writes that without the existence of many ministries, the obstacles of departmentalism will be eliminated, but it should not be forgotten that localism does not only originate in the ministries, but also has roots in many links, especially in various enterprises. Therefore, the possibility of localism occurring must be taken into account. When the leadership of industry and construction is not placed locally, a tendency towards self-sufficiency may emerge within the economic region, that is, an attempt to establish an isolated economy within the region. This tendency may manifest itself in attempts to develop the region's raw material base (even if it is uneconomical); and in attempts to organize the production of various equipment and auxiliary materials within the region.

The editorial believes that local leaders should care about the development of their region, but they must put the overall interests of the people and the country first, and should manage the national economy at any time in accordance with the unified national plan, starting from the overall tasks of the country.

The editorial says that the Party not only improves the organizational form of the economy, but also improves the methods of economic leadership. An important manifestation of the Party spirit in economic work is being good at relying on the masses. Not relying on Party, trade union, and Communist Youth League organizations, and not attracting the broad masses of workers to manage production, is not true Bolshevik leadership. There are still some economic leaders who attempt to adopt purely administrative methods, using one-man management as an excuse. However, one-man management does not exclude, but rather promotes, the need to consider and reflect the opinions of the collective in leadership. If the enterprise leadership does not rely on the factory public, bureaucratic leadership methods will inevitably arise.

The magazine points out that Soviet economic leaders must not only be strict with their subordinates, but also be strict with themselves; they must not only require others to work well, but also require themselves to become models of loving labor, caring for others, and being humble; they should not forget that what is entrusted to them is not only socialist production, but also the people in production. If the factory director only demands a high degree of labor discipline and intense work from the workers, but does not care about the working conditions, living conditions, and welfare of the workers, then his Party spirit in work is not sufficient. A true Soviet economic worker should not separate people from production; his demands are strict, but he is also very concerned about the needs of the working masses.

### 在改组国民经济管理中  善于依靠群众　防止本位主义  苏联“党的生活”论经济工作人员的党性

    在改组国民经济管理中
    善于依靠群众　防止本位主义
    ·苏联“党的生活”论经济工作人员的党性·
    新华社莫斯科6日电　苏联新出版的“党的生活”第八期的社论说，在改组国民经济管理中，必须防止地方主义，同时必须建立依靠群众的领导方法。
    这篇社论的题目是“经济工作人员的党性”。它写道，没有许多部存在，本位主义的障碍就会消除，但是不应该忘记本位主义不只是起源于部里，而且在许多环节，特别是在各个企业里都有根源。因此，必须估计到发生地方主义的可能性。当工业和建设的领导不放到地方上的时候，在经济区内可能出现自给自足的倾向，就是企图在本区内建立孤立的经济。这种倾向可能表现在企图发展本区的原料基地上（尽管这样做是不合算的）；表现在企图在本区组织各种装备和辅助材料的生产上。
    社论认为地方领导人员应该关心本区的发展，但是要把人民和国家的整个利益放在前面，应当从国家的总任务出发，随时按照统一的国家计划来管理国民经济。
    社论说，党不仅改进经济的组织形式，并且也改进经济的领导方法。党性在经济工作中的一种重要表现就是善于依靠群众。不依靠党、工会和青年团组织，不吸引广大劳动群众来管理生产，就不是真正的布尔什维克的领导。我们还有一些企图采用纯行政方式的经济领导者，他们用一长制来作借口。但是一长制并不排斥、而是提倡在领导中必须要估计和反映集体的意见。如果企业领导不依靠工厂公众的话，必然要产生官僚主义领导方法。
    这家杂志指出，苏维埃经济领导人员不仅要对下属要求严格，而且要对自己要求严格；不仅要求别人很好工作，而且要求自己成为爱劳动、关心别人和谦虚的模范；不应忘记交托给他的不仅只有社会主义的生产，而且还有在生产中的人。如果厂长仅要求工人有高度劳动纪律、紧张工作，却不关心劳动的条件、工人居住条件和福利情况，那末，他在工作中党性是不够的。真正的苏维埃经济工作人员不应当把人和生产分开，他的要求是严格的，但是他对劳动群众的要求也是十分关心的。
