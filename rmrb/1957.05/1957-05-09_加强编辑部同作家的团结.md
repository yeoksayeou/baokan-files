I hope that editors will approach manuscripts with more of a socialist, comradely attitude and less of a mercantile or "jianghu" spirit.
Wang Meng

Regarding the revisions made by the "People's Literature" editorial department to "The Young Man Who Arrived at the Organization Department," aside from some minor changes in wording, I believe the primary consideration was to make the work's meaning more explicit. For instance, the editors felt that the relationship between Lin Zhen and Zhao Huiwen was "unclear." Originally, I intended to portray the subtle confusion and rapid self-restraint in their emotional interactions. However, the editor added phrases like Zhao Huiwen's "eyes of sympathy and encouragement," "beautiful, fair fingers," "flushed face," and a lengthy descriptive ending, which "clarified" it into a tragic love story. Similarly, Lin Zhen biting his lower lip after receiving criticism was also "unclear," so the editor added "anger and distress," which certainly made the meaning more explicit than the original. Furthermore, the original manuscript stated, "At first glance, the district committee cadres appeared casual and relaxed." The editor removed "At first glance" and added "mental state," thus turning it into "the district committee cadres' mental state was casual and relaxed"...

Why were there so many "unclear" elements in the original manuscript? On the one hand, it was due to a lack of experience in artistic expression, resulting in some ambiguous and verbose writing. These parts were improved by the editor's deletions, making the work more concise and complete. On the other hand, it reflected some of the author's ideological ambiguities and contradictions. The revisions in this area, which made the unhealthy emotions in the work more "explicit," were somewhat inappropriate.

Why didn't I voice my concerns promptly? Aside from my own unclear thinking, there were other reasons: First, "People's Literature" provided significant encouragement and assistance to my writing, so I overlooked minor dissatisfactions. Second, when "People's Literature" published my "Little Bean" two years ago, they deleted more than one-third of it. I raised objections at the time, but the editors only analyzed the errors in my opinions without engaging in any self-criticism. As a novice writer, I didn't dare argue with some established editors.

Over the past few years, I have keenly felt that editorial departments wield the greatest initiative in handling works, while the rights of authors, especially those with less "reputation," are not guaranteed.

Example one: Several newspapers and periodicals contacted a young author to select and publish chapters from a novel. The responsible person of a newspaper showed the greatest enthusiasm and made several preferential promises (truly preferential!). The young author, trusting the editor's promises, submitted the manuscript. Once the editorial department received the manuscript, their attitude "changed dramatically," and all the conditions were overturned. First, they praised, then rejected, delayed, and deceived, which was truly disheartening for the author.

Example two: A publication received an article from an unknown person criticizing a work published in that periodical. The publication didn't want to publish it but also didn't want to outright reject it, fearing the author would submit it elsewhere, which would harm the publication. So, they adopted delaying tactics. When the author inquired, they claimed it would be published immediately, even vividly telling the author it was "being typeset," "illustrations were being drawn," and "it would be published in the next issue along with XXX's article"... Telling the truth is a civic virtue today, but in my limited experience of dealing with some editors, I could compile a special collection of editors' lies as a warning for young authors in their dealings with the world.

Example three: Some publications simultaneously commission several authors to write on the same topic, then select the best for publication. This naturally benefits quality improvement and is unobjectionable. However, they don't explain this situation when commissioning, showing the same enthusiasm and dedication to each person, overwhelming them with praise so they feel obliged to write, resulting in wasted effort. Once the manuscript reaches the editors, their tone changes.

I deeply feel that for some newspapers and periodicals, you are proactive before submitting the manuscript, but once it's in their hands, you are at their mercy. However, which author can only write manuscripts without submitting them to maintain initiative? So, overall, the author has no initiative.

I hope that editors will approach manuscripts with more of a socialist, comradely attitude and less of a mercantile or "jianghu" spirit. I hope that editors will treat authors equally and strive to overcome the phenomenon of either the big store bullying the customer or the customer bullying the big store.

"The author is responsible for the text" does not mean that the editorial department has no responsibility. Publications run by literary organizations should be a garden of diverse flowers, not just one flower.
Guo Xiaochuan

I have not worked as a literary editor, so I can only offer some immature opinions: 1. The relationship between the editorial department and writers is one of the key issues in implementing the "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" policy. In literary work, "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" means that writers' works are "bloomed" and "contended" through the work of the editorial department in publications (newspapers, books). There is now an abnormal relationship between the editorial department and writers. This is mainly because the editorial department still has an outdated working style and methods that cannot adapt to the new situation, as well as elements of sectarianism and dogmatism. Naturally, the editors are very hardworking, and the editorial department's work has many difficulties. The editors also have opinions and complaints. These difficulties should also be made known to society and writers to seek solutions; opinions should also be put forward; and complaints can also be voiced. But errors are still errors, and shortcomings are still shortcomings, and must be worked hard to overcome.

2. This meeting discussed the general issues in the relationship between the editorial department and writers, as well as a special issue - the "People's Literature" editorial department's modification of Comrade Wang Meng's novel. There are three situations regarding the modification of this novel: First, some places were modified well; second, most of them could be modified or not; third, some places were modified badly, that is, the original work's shortcomings were highlighted. But I think the main aspect is that the modification made the original shortcomings more prominent. The more serious problems are: First, some important modifications were made without the author's consent, some of which were important deletions, and even more inappropriate were some important additions; second, when Comrade Wang Meng's novel was criticized, and some of the criticisms happened to criticize the modified parts, the "People's Literature" editorial department was not able to come out and explain the modification situation and take responsibility for its errors. The above two points, especially the latter point, are the main errors of the "People's Literature" editorial department. Of course, "People's Literature" has achievements in its work. For example, it has indeed published many influential and well-received works in society, and it has also helped many young writers. The writing style of "People's Literature" is also relatively good; however, the "People's Literature" editorial department also has errors. The error of modifying Comrade Wang Meng's novel is only one aspect of it. Related to this, the "People's Literature" editorial department has not done enough in uniting writers. And this is related to the working style of the Writers Association.

3. I also want to talk about several policy issues of publications: First, I think that when writers publish articles in publications, they are of course "responsible for the text," but this does not mean that the publication itself is not responsible. However, an article is only a part of the publication. Judging the publication's policy based on whether the publication of an article is appropriate or not is not very reasonable. It is inappropriate to do a self-criticism for publishing an article. Critics can criticize a publication's policy, writing style, etc., but it is best to look at more and see the entire publication's attitude. Otherwise, it cannot be considered well-founded to criticize the whole by only grasping one point. And this kind of criticism in the past has indeed made the editorial department shrink back, fearing to make mistakes. I think the prevalence of the style of modifying articles cannot be said to have nothing to do with this. Second, some comrades in the editorial department asked: Is our publication today a single flower? Or is it a garden? Meaning, can today's publication only publish works of one genre and reject other genres? I think that publications run by literary organizations today can only be a garden of diverse flowers (and should also have their own characteristics), not a single flower; considering the existing traditions of the publications, the composition of the editors, and the fact that they are run by literary organizations, if the unique style and characteristics of each publication are overemphasized (to the extent that they are regarded as "a single flower"), it will limit "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend". Third, I think Comrade Mao Dun is right that publications must be responsible to both readers and writers. Neither should be neglected, nor should they be opposed to each other. If you only talk about being responsible to readers and do not work to unite writers, there will also be abuses.

Editorial staff are unsung heroes in the cultural cause. Handling manuscripts should neither be left to laissez-faire nor be crude and arbitrary.
Xiao Qian

Editorial work is a behind-the-scenes job, that is, it is hard work and indispensable. Editorial staff are unsung heroes in our cultural cause. Not only must he be able to endure hard work, but also worthy of sympathy is that he must also bear grievances. Comrade Wei Junyi has already talked about the joys and sorrows of editing in great detail. If I continue to talk about it, I am afraid that this will become an editor's complaint meeting. I want to talk about another aspect. The editor objectively holds the gate between the author and the reader. Once a work is sent to the editor, he controls the fate of that work. At this moment, even experienced editors are facing serious tests.

First of all, there is the language problem. Chinese grammar has not yet been standardized, the country is large, there are many dialects, and it is rare for authors and editors to be from the same small town by chance. Different regions have different language habits.

More fragile than language is the character image in literary works. How many years does it take for a fox in Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio to cultivate to become an immortal, and how many days does a character have to cultivate in the writer's mind to take shape. But in the editor's mind, it is at most a few days - often a few hours (the time spent in the drawer cannot be counted).

I know that there is a photo retouching technique in photo studios in Beijing. If the background of a photo is not good, or the picture is too crowded, they can "blur" it. This is probably equivalent to the deletion in the middle of the editing work. After the photos are developed, the photo studio can also use a fine brush to trace them - generally not tracing the facial features, for fear of losing the appearance. As far as literary works are concerned, the "facial features" are first of all the spiritual outlook of the characters. Photo studios never add anything to the photos for customers. The reason is that it is difficult to match it properly.

When the "People's Literature" editorial department revised Comrade Wang Meng's "The Young Man Who Arrived at the Organization Department," they did some "blurring" and "tracing." Whether this work is done appropriately or not, it is within the scope of the editorial department's work, and no one can guarantee that it is done appropriately. From the perspective of the photo studio's rules, I think the editorial department's revision also exceeds the general scope. The editor traced the facial features of the characters in the work, changed the ears, or, in other words, added a dimple that was not very beautiful.

I don't quite agree with Comrade Kejia's opinion that the manuscripts of old writers should not be revised, because it is not good for the readers and may not be good for the old writers. If his so-called old writers include those old writers who have not written for a long time, my experience is: old writers certainly do not want their articles to be published with a completely different appearance, but before publishing, he is more eager to hear some objective opinions than young people, especially the opinions of those who understand the policy better than him, are in touch with reality, and are familiar with the literary and artistic circles. He does not want to make mistakes and encounter setbacks as soon as he starts writing. Therefore, unless a rule is set at the same time, saying that old writers can be exempt from criticism if they write wrong (this is of course impossible), otherwise, it is equivalent to increasing the chances for old writers to make mistakes and be criticized. If that is the case, many people will have to declare in their manuscripts in the future, "Please don't mistakenly list me as an old writer, otherwise it will be too disadvantageous."

Therefore, if "People's Literature" wants to correct the deviation by emphasizing "responsibility for the text," I am worried that this can only solve part of the problem. To use a commercial analogy, the writer is the manufacturer, and the publication is the department store. Everyone requires diversification of goods, but if a thermos is bought back from the department store and it explodes at home and injures the child, the manufacturer of the thermos will be criticized, and the department store probably cannot say that since you require diversification, I will no longer be responsible. Helping authors improve the quality of their works as the first reader - a clear-headed, careful, and experienced reader - is the editor's duty.

I think the problem we are facing is definitely not whether we should revise, but how to revise: is it a hard revision, or a revision in consultation with the author? Is it the editor who revises, or inspires the author to revise? Only by discussing in this direction can we have a positive effect on future editing work. I think "People's Literature" has the responsibility and the right to point out the shortcomings in Comrade Wang Meng's work, consult with him, and help him revise.

In order to be seriously responsible to the author and avoid seriously affecting the future of talented young writers due to our negligence in the future, I think there are two lessons contained here: First, our editing work does not end with the publication of the work, just as the department store cannot end with selling things. Publications have a responsibility to pay attention to the reactions of the articles they publish outside, especially when this reaction has national significance and has even attracted the attention of the Party Central Committee and the international community. Second, if the article that has been extensively revised by us has been criticized by more than one party, the editorial department needs to check the original manuscript in time. If it is indeed responsible for a part of it, it is best to take the initiative to stand up, either share the responsibility that should be shared, or defend the reasons for the revision. Such "responsibility for the text" will be more scientific and more practical.

Regarding revision, I think the best policy is to put forward outline opinions for the author to refer to and revise himself. The second best policy is to have the editorial department revise it with a pencil (the pencil indicates that there is room for discussion) and send it to the author for consideration. If he agrees, he is asked to trace it with a pen; a serious author is likely to neither trace it as it is, nor stick to the original work, but absorb the opinions of the reviser and start all over again - in fact, that is the exchange of ideas between the author and the editor. Revising without the author's consent is always the worst policy.

Finally, I very much agree with Comrade Mao Dun's "opening remarks": the editor must be responsible to both the reader and the author. This determines that he cannot let the manuscripts go their own way, nor can he be crude and arbitrary.

Only by extensively uniting writers can we change the face of the publication and run it well.
Liu Baiyu

Our discussion of the relationship between the editorial department and writers is to raise this contradiction, examine our shortcomings, and solve them appropriately, in order to achieve the goal of improving the publication. Since it is a contradiction, the problem may come from two aspects, but today we mainly talk from the perspective of the publication's editorial department.

Editors and writers, and readers, have different requirements. But editors and writers are jointly responsible for the readers, so their relationship should be close. Of course, editing work is hard and meritorious. But now many publications have not only abnormal relations with writers, but even estrangement, which is very bad.

This time, taking the "People's Literature" editorial department's revision of "The Young Man Who Arrived at the Organization Department" as an example to study the issue of manuscript revision is beneficial. However, I don't think this can be simply or extremely solved by saying "must revise" or "must not revise." The question is how to revise. Since editors and writers have a joint responsibility to the readers, then why can't it be revised if it is beneficial to the readers and also beneficial to the author? I don't think it is not to revise, but it must obtain the author's consent. It is best to ask the writer to revise it himself. In case the manuscript is issued too quickly, the editorial department should only polish the text and correct obvious errors, and should not revise the content and style of the work. The serious fault of the revision of Comrade Wang Meng's novel lies here. Why was such a revision made? Being busy, working overnight, and rushing to issue the manuscript are all objective reasons, but the editors were overly confident and complacent due to the gratitude of the revised manuscript, and subjectivism grew, which cannot be said to be an important reason. In order to truly summarize the experience and lessons, I think it is necessary to trace from the subjective ideology. For example, some people say: the revision of the manuscript is to ensure the high level and good quality of the publication. Of course, a certain revision does have this good effect, and this intention should be said to be good, but I suspect that we do not start from the actual level of Chinese creation, gradually improve through publication, encouragement, criticism, and help, but use a large number of revisions, can we steadily maintain the quality of our literature?

From this issue, I also think of the issue of publications extensively uniting writers and publishing works of various styles and writers. Regarding this, some people are also afraid: extensive unity will reduce quality. After careful consideration, this is also likely to be a manifestation of subjectivism. May I ask: is it to keep the publication's path narrower and narrower, and more and more people are unwilling to provide manuscripts, or is it to extensively unite writers, encourage various experiments, and gradually improve with the gradual development of the overall creative level in order to maintain the quality of the publication? "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" is precisely to broadly promote and develop literary competition and advance, and to push the quality of our literary and artistic level to a peak from the competition and advance. Some publications treat writers, pitting old writers against new writers, emphasizing this and belittling that, or emphasizing that and belittling this, in essence, these are all not conducive to extensive unity and letting a hundred flowers bloom. The reason why I talk about these is to find our subjectivism and sectarianism from the depths of our thoughts, find the ideological roots, and correct them, so that we can truly change our work. I am not saying that we can ignore the quality of the publication, but I do not agree to use the words to ensure quality to ignore some writers and not respect the labor of writers. Of course, these shortcomings are not only the shortcomings of the publication's editorial department, but also the problems in the work of the Writers Association. I heard that the "People's Literature" editorial department learned a lesson from the incident of revising Comrade Wang Meng's work and is preparing to make a big change in July. I fully agree with this. For this purpose, we should correct past improper handling, and should take the initiative to explain our shortcomings to the writers who have been estranged, and must invite them to write for the publication. We must recognize that only by extensively uniting writers can we change the face of the publication and run it well.

The editorial department always hopes that there will be more Marxism in the publication, but does not implement the Party's policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend." Such Marxism is probably dogmatism and sectarianism.
Yan Wenjing

The editorial department and writers are interdependent, but also contradictory. To properly solve this problem, we should first ask the editorial department, as many people have said, the editors hold the power of life and death over articles. In fact, this is also the case.

What to ask the editorial department? In a word, ask to respect the writers' labor. Disrespect for the writers' labor is manifested in many aspects. For example: inappropriate rejection of manuscripts, crude deletion and modification of manuscripts, good articles not being emphasized, rigid assignment of topics, etc. are all.

There may be many reasons for the problem. The most important reason is that some of our comrades have not understood the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend."

People who work as editors probably have this kind of mentality, always hoping that there will be more Marxism in the publications they run; if they run literary publications, they also hope that the published works will have higher artistic levels. Of course, hoping to have more Marxism and higher artistic levels in the publication cannot be said to be wrong. But hoping for more Marxism and not implementing the Party's policy, not "blooming" and "contending" in the publication, and opposing Marxism to the Party's policy, such Marxism is probably actually dogmatism and sectarianism. Wanting to improve the level of the publication, but not launching free competition and free discussion, this is actually impossible.

I think it is very possible to doubt whether the "high level" in our minds is high or low, right or wrong. The "high level" we are talking about often cannot avoid being subjective. We often confuse personal preferences, personal genres in art with the objective standards of art, so we often only promote one or two kinds of flowers, while excluding and obliterating many other flowers. If the submitted manuscripts do not meet our own standard, or are not the flowers in our minds, then we will operate on them.

We think that the motive is very good, but the effect is very bad. Tender buds cannot withstand the surgery of moving hoes, and stout trees cannot withstand the repeated processing of axes and saws. No matter how you process it, lilacs cannot be enlarged into peonies, and chrysanthemums cannot be turned into water lilies. In order to increase the aroma of tea, fresh flowers can be baked into dried flowers, but the life of the flowers is gone.

Of course, I am not saying that we cannot revise manuscripts from now on. But this is a work that should be treated very carefully. The editorial comrades should also carefully study and see which aspects of the various manuscripts should be revised in the future and which aspects should not be revised. I think the modification of wrong characters, wrong words, and wrong punctuation marks should be done, and I think it is also possible to modify grammar that is not smooth and logic that has problems. But this problem is much more complicated. Because some problems that we see as grammar or logic problems are actually style problems. I think that the author's style and writing style should not be changed in any way. It seems that articles that are verbose and repetitive should be helped to be sorted out, but this should also be done very carefully. At one meeting, Comrade Wu Zuxiang said that Dostoevsky's articles also looked verbose, and if you wanted to change his articles to be as concise as Tolstoy's articles, he would not be Dostoevsky. I agree with Comrade Wu Zuxiang's opinion.

I think the ideological content of the article should not be revised. The editors of the publication should try their best to understand the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," and let more flowers bloom, but this does not mean that the editors should not distinguish between the submitted manuscripts, and the editorial department has no choice of submitted manuscripts. No publication can publish all submitted manuscripts. If the editorial department really disagrees with the ideological content of certain manuscripts, I think it is better to reject the manuscript than to arbitrarily change the ideological content of other people's articles. Changing the ideological content of other people's articles is actually writing articles for others. This practice is more rude than arbitrarily rejecting manuscripts, and it is not good even if the reviser works harder. If an article is wrongly rejected by one publication, it may still be published in another publication. From a national perspective, this flower is finally "bloomed." But if an article is changed beyond recognition by one publication, although it is published in that publication, that flower is actually destroyed.

The editorial department should be responsible for the overall picture of the publication in a certain period, and does not necessarily bear specific responsibility for each work, and should appropriately promote "responsibility for the text."
Ge Luo

The relationship between "People's Literature" and the writers is not good enough. We have heard some writers' reflections on "People's Literature." Among them, the more common opinions are that the publication's style is "bossy" and a bit "unapproachable"; they feel that the publication's editorial department is not enthusiastic and friendly enough to them. After in-depth examination, we have realized that: to do a good job in uniting writers in the future, the main key lies in overcoming our ideological subjectivism, narrowness, and simple and rigid working attitude and lack of humility, etc., that is, changing our "bossy" style.

In the past, our contact with writers was not enough, and the work of organizing manuscripts was not very active, especially the contact with old writers was not enough and not common enough. We did not conduct regular and active manuscript soliciting activities among old writers. Of course, there are also some objective reasons for this. For example, the editorial department has few people and the work is heavy (there are more than 10 million words of submitted manuscripts every month), and we often feel that the manpower is not enough; most of the comrades who are engaged in editing work are young comrades, and they are not used to contacting old writers, but the most basic reason is still that we have not paid attention to this aspect of work.

Improperly handling some writers' submitted manuscripts is also one of the main reasons that we have estrangement with some writers. Because we have subjectivism and narrowness in our thoughts, many manuscripts that could have been used were considered unusable by us. Some works did not have major problems in ideological content, but we also thought that there were problems in ideological content. There were also some works that were rejected simply because the expression techniques and artistic style did not suit our aesthetic taste... When we did this, we often acted out of a kind of "good intention," thinking that we were responsible to the readers and also to the author. In the rejection letters written to the writers, we sometimes wrote like this: "In order to protect you, we think it is better not to publish this work..." The writers could only laugh or cry when they received such letters.

The fact that Wang Meng's novel was wrongly modified was by no means accidental, and this error was by no means an error of Comrade Qin Zhaoyang alone. It reflects a serious problem that exists in our work. Originally, our editorial department had stipulated the following policy for modifying manuscripts: for manuscripts that can not be modified, try not to modify them as much as possible; when modifications are necessary, suggestions should be made as much as possible for the author to modify himself; except for textual modifications, after the manuscripts are modified by us, we should try our best to show them to the author before publication, or modify them after obtaining the author's consent. Although these methods cannot be said to have not been implemented at all, they were not implemented very seriously and very thoroughly in actual work. Especially when the publication is urgent and the manuscripts are still very lacking, we often forget this policy, so we cause some shortcomings and errors. Sometimes the works published after modification will also get some good reflections from the authors, which will further increase our complacency. And we do not face up to the shortcomings or errors produced in this modification, and sometimes we have even been criticized by the authors, but it has not aroused our vigilance. Over time, this careless, rash, and sometimes even rude attitude towards manuscripts has gradually formed a very bad style in our editing work. The event of modifying Wang Meng's novel has provided us with a serious lesson.

Finally, I would like to offer a few personal opinions on future work:

1. Literary publications originally have two tasks: on the one hand, uniting the vast number of professional writers, and on the other hand, discovering talented new authors from the submitted manuscripts, giving them necessary help, and transporting fresh blood for the literary team. "People's Literature" often neglected one or the other in the past, which damaged the work. We must pay attention to both aspects in the future.

2. The writer and the publication that selected this work are of course responsible for this work after the writer publishes the work in the publication. However, according to the past situation, the responsibility shared by the publication seems to be too heavy, so it is somewhat unreasonable (such as when an error is found in the content of a work, the author makes a self-criticism, and the publication also makes a self-criticism). I think that the editorial department should be responsible for the publication's appearance in a certain period, and does not necessarily bear specific responsibility for each work. In order to facilitate the implementation of the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," we should appropriately promote and publicize "responsibility for the text."

3. Because the language and words, ideological content, character images, and artistic style of literary works are difficult to completely separate, I advocate that editors should not make so-called "textual" modifications (such as deletions, compressions, etc.) to the works except for typos and obviously incomprehensible sentences. If you want to change it, you must consult with the author.

In the future, "Translation" should translate and publish works of various genres and styles from countries around the world.
Chen Bingyi

The issue of the "People's Literature" editorial department revising Wang Meng's original novel manuscript also has a significant lesson for the "Translation" editorial department, because the "Translation" editorial department also helps translators revise manuscripts, and there are also problems and errors in the manuscript revision work.

In order to minimize possible oversights and errors in the original manuscript, and also to prevent the editorial department from revising the original manuscript incorrectly or badly, we have established a set of editing work system for proofreading, processing, arranging, and finalizing the manuscript, and also stipulate that the revision of the original manuscript must be done by giving opinions to the translator and asking the translator to revise it himself or by obtaining their consent before the editorial department modifies it. The editorial department spends a lot of effort in helping translators proofread and revise the original manuscript, but there are still often deviations and errors in the proofreading process. Some translations are correct, but the editorial department changes them incorrectly; and some translations can be translated in this way or that way. It is originally a problem of the translator's own translation method or translation style, but the editorial department must modify them into their own translation method and writing style. Even if the translation is not changed incorrectly in this way, it is still incorrect to force the translator to accept the editorial department's own translation method and writing style. More seriously, sometimes the original better and stylish translation is changed badly. When revising the prefaces and postscripts written by the translators, the editorial department sometimes forces the translators to be consistent with the editorial department in terms of views and even writing methods, and inappropriately modifies the translators' views to what the editorial department requires.

In order to respect the author and avoid changing the manuscripts incorrectly, some comrades at the meeting advocated using the method of implementing "responsibility for the text." Some comrades in our editorial department also proposed this suggestion. From the perspective of "Translation" 's work, this is probably not the way to do it. Generally speaking, the "responsibility for the text" should basically be "borne by" the author. The quality of the translation depends mainly on the translator. The editorial department's help in proofreading and revision should only play a role in adding icing on the cake. But there are indeed some manuscripts that are translated relatively poorly and are published only after the editorial department or another invited proofreader makes major revisions. This practice was originally not worth learning from, but in order to meet the needs of the layout, the editorial department often has to reluctantly do it. It is estimated that this situation will still be unavoidable in the future. Even the translations of old translators with cultivation, so-called wise men have a thousand thoughts, but they may miss one thing, it is inevitable that there will be oversights, and most of them also hope that the editorial department will give opinions on their original manuscripts. Therefore, avoiding changing the manuscripts incorrectly is only the negative side. The more important positive side is how the editorial department can cooperate closely and friendly with the translators and work together to revise the manuscripts better.

In recent years, there has been a stereotyped, dull translation style that only pursues "faithfulness" to the original work on the surface and haggling over the "smoothness" of Chinese grammar. There are of course many reasons for the popularity of this translation style, but it is probably not completely unrelated to the shortcomings and problems in the editorial department's work. In the future, the editorial department should boldly allow, and even consciously support, various creative literary translation art attempts, and should also promote more truly capable artistic translations that convey the spirit of the original work, have style and personality, and are beautiful.

Editorial work has shortcomings, and editorial staff also have troubles. I hope that readers will not think that the articles in the publication all represent the opinions of the editorial department.
Wei Junyi

People who are editors have been often blamed in the past few years, and are often reviewing themselves. Stop, and I will still have to review myself. But I also want to ask: why do we people like to make mistakes so often? Everyone knows our mistakes. Our troubles, it seems, can also be asked to be understood by others. I want to tell these bitterness first, and then make a review.

First, the question of whether the responsibility for the text is borne by oneself or borne by the editorial department on behalf. It should be borne by oneself. But the social perception in the past was not the case. If there was a problem with an article published in the publication, it would be blamed on the editorial department. Even when criticizing an article with errors, the author's name was not mentioned at all, but only that it was published in a certain publication. This is especially true when criticizing articles written by little-known authors. This cannot but form the habit of editors scrutinizing every word when reviewing manuscripts, and wanting to change it if there is a slight problem, as if treating their own articles, because they have to take responsibility for him, and if there is a problem, it is the editorial department's responsibility.

Second, in addition to being correct and having a high level, it must also meet the requirements of the readers. The more mass-based the publication, the more this point cannot be ignored. When encountering questions that are universal in the vast number of readers, this point is even more prominent, and the editorial department is prone to be demanding on the article, wanting to make it suitable for everyone's needs.

Third, it is impossible to publish all submitted manuscripts. The comrades who receive the rejected manuscripts are always not very satisfied. Young comrades always criticize the editorial department for being authoritative, while old writers criticize them for not uniting old writers. In the selection of manuscripts, it is difficult to say that there is absolute certainty. The editor's own literary ideas, artistic tastes, and appreciation abilities... all have an impact on the selection of manuscripts. Due to these many reasons, we have indeed made many mistakes. But the critics always raise the issue to the editor's political qualities, as if everyone who is an editor has no integrity, worships authority, and is snobbish..., which makes the editors feel even more wronged. In addition, there are those who scold the editors for publishing their own articles in the publication. In fact, it is extremely difficult to get new articles to review, and the editors often take up the responsibility in desperation.

Fourth, the difficulty of modifying manuscripts. Whether to modify or not is a big problem. Young submitters all require modification and publication, which is of course impossible to do. The editorial department always wants to select some that have a modification foundation and modify them for use. It is not good to return it to the person for modification, so they often modify it for them. It is easy to have problems with such modification, and if they are not modified, the opportunities for these submissions to be published will be reduced. This is also a difficult problem.

These things are what make us often feel troubled. Of course, this cannot eliminate our mistakes. We have made many mistakes, and "Literary Study" has also made mistakes in modifying manuscripts. For the sake of prudence, the editorial department sent some articles to many comrades to circulate, and if everyone disagreed with one of the arguments, the executive editor would definitely ask the author to modify it in order to "respect the collective leadership." Later, we ourselves knew that this practice was completely wrong. First of all, the editorial department's views are not necessarily correct, and the editorial department does not necessarily have a completely accurate estimate of the readers' situation. Even if this is really the case, it is only good for readers to publish some articles with different tastes and different opinions. Our young readers read too many articles with the same taste and the same intention, so that many people simply do not know that there are

    加强编辑部同作家的团结
    最近中国作家协会召开北京文学期刊编辑工作座谈会，一部分发言记录的摘要已经登载在昨天本报，其余部分分别登在今天的第七版、第八版和明天的第七版上。
    希望编辑同志处理稿子时，多几分社会主义的同志态度，少几分商人气，江湖气。
    王蒙
    “人民文学”编辑部对于“组织部新来的青年人”的修改，除了文字细节上的一些更
  动以外，我觉得主要是从这么一个考虑出发的：使作品的意思更明确些。譬如突出使编辑同志认为“不明确”的是林震与赵慧文的关系，我原来是想写作两个人交往过程中的感情的轻微的困惑与迅速的自制，经编者加上赵慧文的“同情和鼓励的眼睛”，“白白的好看的手指”，“映红了的脸儿”和结尾时的大段描写，就“明确”成为悲剧式的爱情了。再如林震受了批评咬住下嘴唇，这本来也不明确，编者加上“气愤和苦恼”几个字，当然也比原意明确了些。再如原稿说“一眼看去，区委会的干部是随意而松懈的”，编者去掉“一眼看去”四个字，加上“精神状态”四个字，就变成区委干部们的精神状态是随意而松懈的了……
    原稿为什么有许多“不明确”呢？一方面，是由于艺术表现方面的缺少经验，有一些含混、啰嗦的文字。这些经编者删改以后，作品更精练、完整些。一方面，却是反映了作者思想上的一些模糊、矛盾的。这方面的修改，使作品的不健康情绪更加“明确”了，是有某些不恰当的地方的。
    我为什么没有及时提出意见呢？除了因为自己思想也不明确外，还有下面的原因：一是“人民文学”对我的写作给了很大鼓励和帮助，小有不满，也就算了。再有前年“人民文学”发表我的“小豆儿”时，删掉了三分之一以上，我当时曾经提出过意见，后来编辑同志和我谈了谈，只是分析我的意见的错误，却没有进行什么自我批评，于是作为一个初学写作者，我也就不大敢和一些有成就的编辑同志争了。
    几年来，我痛切地感到对作品的处理问题上，编辑部握有最大的主动，而作者特别是一些“名声”不响的作者的权益是得不到保障的。
    例子之一，有几个报刊联系要选登某青年作者的一个长篇的若干章节，这时某报纸负责人表现了最大的积极性，并提出了若干优惠条件（真是优惠极了！），该青年作者轻信了编辑部的允诺，编辑部稿子一经到手，态度“焕然一新”，所有的条件一概推翻，先是捧、然后是推、拖、哄，实在叫作者寒心。
    例子之二，某刊物收到了一个无名人氏写的文章，这文章是批评刊登在该刊物上的某篇作品的。刊物不愿意发，但又不愿说不发，怕作者把文章转寄他处，登出来对刊物本身有损，于是也采取了拖延战术，当作者催问时声称立即刊出，甚至活灵活现地告诉作者“正在排印”，“正在画插图”，“等到下一期和×××的文章一齐发”……。不说谎，是今天的公民道德，但是在我些许的和某些编辑打交道的经验中，就可以把编辑说的谎话辑成专集，以为青年作者处世立身之戒。
    例子之三，有的刊物同时以一个题目约几个作者写文章，然后择优而用，这自然有利于提高质量，无可厚非；但他们在约稿时并不说明这种情况，对每个人都是同样地热情、专一，连捧带泡，使得一些人不好意思不写。结果浪费自己的劳动。稿子一到了编者的手，编辑同志说话的语气也就变了。
    我深深感到，对于某些报刊说来稿子给编辑部以前，你是主动的，稿子给了他，你就只有任人摆布的份儿，但是，哪个作者能为了保持主动地位而只写稿不投稿呢，所以总的来说，作者就没有什么主动了。
    希望编辑同志处理稿子时多几分社会主义的同志态度，少几分商人气，江湖气。希望编者对作者平等看待，尽力克服店大压客或客大压店的现象。
    “文责自负”并不等于编辑部就不负责任。现在的文学团体主办的刊物只能是一个百花齐放花园，而不能是一朵花。
    郭小川
    我没有做文学编辑工作，只能提一些不成熟的意见：一、编辑部和作家之间的关系问题，是贯彻“百花齐放、百家争鸣”方针的关键问题之一。“百花齐放、百家争鸣”在文学工作上就是作家的作品通过编辑部的工作在刊物（报纸、书籍）上“放”和“鸣”。现在编辑部和作家之间有一种不正常的关系，这主要就是编辑部还有一套过时的工作作风和工作方法，不能适应新的形势，还有宗派主义、教条主义的东西。自然，编辑同志是很辛苦的，编辑部的工作也有不少困难，编辑同志也有意见，有牢骚；这种困难也是应当让社会上、让作家们知道，以便谋求解决；意见也是应当提的；牢骚也是可以发的。但是错误还是错误，缺点还是缺点，必须努力克服。
    二、这次会议讨论到编辑部和作家之间的关系中的一般问题，也讨论了一个特殊问题——“人民文学”编辑部修改王蒙同志小说的问题。对这篇小说的修改有三种情况：一，有些地方修改好了；二，大多数都是可改可不改的；三，有些地方是改坏了，即突出了原作的缺点。但，我认为，主要的方面，是改得使原来的缺点更突出了。更严重的问题是：一，未经作者的同意就做了一些重要的修改，其中，有些是重要的删节，更不应当的是作了一些重要的添加；二，在王蒙同志小说受到批评的时候，而且有些批评正好批评到被修改了的地方，“人民文学”编辑部没有能够出来说明这个修改的情况，承担它的错误。以上两点，特别后一点，是“人民文学”编辑部的主要错误。当然，“人民文学”的工作是有成绩的。比如，它确实登了不少在社会上有影响的，得到好评的作品，它也帮助过不少的青年作家，“人民文学”的文风也是比较好的；但是，“人民文学”编辑部也有错误。修改王蒙同志小说的错误，只是其中的一端，与这个相联系，“人民文学”编辑部对于团结作家作得非常不够。而这又是与作家协会的工作作风相联系的。
    三，我还想谈到刊物的几个方针性的问题：第一，我觉得，作家在刊物上发表文章，当然是“文责自负”，但这也不是说刊物本身就不负责任。不过，一篇文章只是刊物的一个局部，从刊登一篇文章的是否适当就断定刊物的方针如何如何，这是没有多少道理的。为了登载一篇文章就做检讨，这是不合适的。批评者可以批评一个刊物的方针、文风等等，但最好还是多看看，看到整个刊物的态度，否则只抓住一点就批评全面，不能算是持之有据的。而过去的这种批评，确曾使编辑部缩手缩脚，唯恐犯错误。我看，修改文章之风之所以盛行，与这不能说没有关系。第二，有的编辑部同志提出：今天我们的刊物是一朵花呢？还是一个花园？意思是说今天的刊物可不可以只登一个流派的作品、而拒绝别种的作品？我认为，现在文学团体主办的刊物只能是一个百花齐放花园，（也应当各有特色）而不能是一朵花；考虑到现有刊物的传统、编辑的成分和由文学团体主办的这些情况，如果过分地强调各个刊物的独特风格和特色（以致当成是“一朵花”），就会限制了“百花齐放、百家争鸣”。第三，我觉得，茅盾同志说得对，刊物又要为读者负责、又要为作家负责。两者不可偏废，也不能对立起来，如果只说对读者负责，不去作团结作者的工作，那也会发生流弊的。
    编辑工作人员是文化事业中的无名英雄。理处稿件既不能放任自流，也不能粗暴武断。
    萧乾
    编辑工作是一种后台工作，也就是说，是辛苦的，而又必不可少的。编辑人员是我们文化事业中的无名英雄。他不但得任劳，更值得人们同情的是，他还得任怨。关于编辑的甘苦，韦君宜同志谈得已经淋漓尽致了，如果我再谈下去，怕把这个变成为一个编辑的诉苦会。我想谈谈另外一方面。编辑客观上是在把着作者与读者之间的那道关口，一部作品一旦送到编辑手里，他就掌握了那部作品的命运。这当儿，即使饱有经验的编辑，也都面临严重的考验。
    首先就发生了语言问题。中国语法还没规范化，国家地方大，方言多，作者与编辑难得碰巧是小同乡。地区不同，语言习惯就有差别。
    比语言更脆嫩的，是文学作品里的人物形象。聊斋里的狐狸要苦修多少年才能成仙，一个人物在作家脑子里也得苦修多少日子才能成形。可是它在编辑的脑子里最多也不过几天——常常是几个小时（停留在抽屉里的时间不能计算在内）。
    我知道北京的照像馆里有一种修相的技术。一张照片的背景不大好，或是画面太挤，他们可以把它“虚”掉。这大概就相当于编辑工作中间的删节。像片洗好了以后，照像馆还可以用一枝细毛笔描一描——一般是不大描五官的，怕走了相。就文学作品来说，“五官”首先就是人物的精神面貌。照相馆从来也不替顾客在相片上加点什么。原因是很难配得恰当。
    “人民文学”编辑部在修改王蒙同志的“组织部新来的青年人”的时候做了一些“虚”和“描”的工作，这种工作不论做得恰当不恰当，都是编辑部分内的工作，而且谁也不能保险做得都恰当。从照相馆的行规来说，我觉得编辑部的修改也有超出一般范围的地方，编辑替作品人物描了五官，换了耳朵，或者说，添了个不算顶美的酒涡。
    我不大同意克家同志说的，老作家的稿子不要改的意见，因为那样做对读者不利，对老作家也未必好。如果他所谓的老作家包括那些久不动笔的老作家的话，我的体会是：老作家固然不希望他的文章登出来面目全非，但是在发表以前，他比年青人更急于听到一些客观的意见，尤其是那些比他了解政策，接触现实，熟悉文艺界情况的人们的意见。他并不希望一动笔就犯错误，就遭遇挫折。因此，除非同时定下一条规矩，说老作家写错了可以免予批评（这当然不可能），否则，就等于增加老作家犯错误、受批评的机会。要是那样，许多人以后写稿一定得声明，千万别把我错列入老作家，否则就太吃亏了。
  因此，今后“人民文学”要用强调“文责自责”来纠偏，我担心这只能解决一部分问题。打个商业的比方，作家是制造者，刊物是百货公司，大家要求货品多样化，但是如果从百货商店买回一个热水瓶，到家就爆炸了，伤了孩子，制造热水瓶的要挨批评，百货公司大约也不能说，你们既然要求多样化，我就不再负责。以第一个读者——头脑清新、细心在行的读者身份，帮助作者提高作品质量是编辑的天职。
    我想我们面对的问题绝对不是应不应该改，而是怎样去改：是硬改呢，还是跟作者商量着改。是编者动手改呢，还是启发作者去改。只有朝这个方向讨论，才能对今后的编辑工作起积极的作用。我认为“人民文学”有责任也有权利指出王蒙同志作品中的缺点，和他商量，帮助他修改。
    为了认真地对作者负责，避免今后由于我们的疏忽而严重地影响有才能的青年作家的前途，我认为这里还包含着两个教训：一，我们的编辑工作并不是以发表完作品为终结，正如百货公司不能以卖完了事。刊物有责任重视它所登的文章在外间起的反应，尤其这个反应已经具有全国意义，甚至引起了党中央和国际上的注意。第二，如果经过我们大举修改的文章受到了不止一方的批评，编辑部有必要及时地查对一下原稿，如果确实负有一部分责任，最好就主动地挺身而出，或者分担应分担的责任，或者根据修改的理由，进行辩护。这样的“文责自负”会更科学、更切实一些。
    关于修改，我想上策还是提出轮廓性的意见供作者参考，由本人去改。中策是由编辑部用铅笔改（铅笔表示有商量的余地），送作者去斟酌，同意的，就请他用钢笔描上；一个认真的作者很可能既不照描，也不固执于原作，而是吸收了修改人的意见，另起炉灶——事实上，那就是作者与编辑之间的思想交流。不征得作者同意就改，反正是个下策。
    最后，我非常同意茅盾同志在“开场白”里说的：编辑既要对读者负责，又得对作者负责。这就注定了：他对稿件既不能放任自流，也不能粗暴武断。
    只有广泛团结作家，才能改变刊物面貌，把刊物办好。
    刘白羽
    我们讨论编辑部与作家的关系，就是提出这个矛盾，检查我们的缺点，并加以恰当地解决，以达到改进刊物的目的。即然是矛盾，问题可能来自两个方面，但今天我们主要从刊物编辑部方面来谈。
    编辑与作家，与读者，是各有不同的要求的。但编辑与作家，在为了读者这一点上是共同负责的，因此彼此关系应当是密切的。当然，编辑工作是艰辛的，是有功绩的。但现在有不少刊物与作家关系，不仅不正常，甚至发生隔阂，这就非常不好。
    这次，以“人民文学”编辑部修改“组织部新来的青年人”为例，来研究有关稿件修改的问题，是有益处的。但，我觉得这不能简单化、极端化地用一个“一定改”或“一定不改”来解决。问题是怎样改。既然编辑与作家对读者负有共同责任，那末，改，如果对读者有利，对作者也有利，为什么不能改呢？我认为不是不改，但必须取得本人同意，最好请作家自己改，万一发稿过急，编辑部最好也只润色文字，修正显然的错误，而不要对作品的内容、风格进行修改。对王蒙同志小说修改的严重毛病就在这里。为什么作了这样修改呢？忙，连夜工作，急于发稿，这些客观原因都是实情，但编辑者由于曾经受到被改稿人的感谢，因而主观上过分自信自满，滋长了主观主义，却不能说不是重要原因。要真正总结出经验教训，我以为从主观思想上追索一下是必要的。比方有人说：修改稿子是为了保证刊物高的水平，好的质量，当然，一定的修改确实是有这种好作用的，这种用意应该说是好的，不过，我怀疑，我们不从中国目前创作实际水平出发，经过发表、鼓励、批评、帮助，逐步提高，而用大量删改的人为方法，能够稳固地保持我们文学的什么质量。
    由这问题，我还联想到刊物广泛团结作家，发表各种不同风格、作家作品的问题。关于这，也有人怕：广泛团结就要降低质量。认真思索一下，这恐也只能是主观主义的一种表现。请问：是使刊物的路子愈走愈窄，愈来愈多的人不愿供给稿件，就保持了刊物的质量呢？还是广泛团结作家，鼓舞各种试验，随着整个创作水平的逐步发展，而逐步提高，才能保持了刊物的质量呢？“百花齐放，百家争鸣”就正是广阔地推动、发展文学竞赛前进，从竞赛前进中来把我们文学艺术水平质量推向高峰。有的刊物对待作家时，把老作家与新作家对立，重此轻彼，或重彼轻此，实质上，这都是不利于广泛团结，百花齐放的。我所以谈到这些，是为了从我们思想深处找一找我们主观主义、宗派主义，找着思想根源，加以纠正，才能真正改变我们工作。我不是说可以不注意刊物的质量，而是不赞成以保证质量这话，来忽视一些作家，来不尊重作家劳动。当然这些缺点不仅是刊物编辑部的缺点，也是作家协会工作中的问题。我听说“人民文学”编辑部从修改王蒙同志作品事件中吸取教训，正准备在7月间来一个大改变，我是举双手赞成的。为了这个目的，就应当纠正过去处理不当的事，应当主动向已发生隔阂的作家说清我们的缺点，并一定约请他们为刊物写稿。我们必须认清只有广泛团结作家，才能改变刊物面貌，把刊物办好。
    编辑部总希望刊物上马克思主义多一些，却又不执行党的“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针。这样的马克思主义，恐怕就是教条主义和宗派主义。
    严文井
    编辑部和作家是相依为命，但又互相矛盾的。要妥善地解决这个问题，首先应当要求编辑部，很多人不是说过吗，编辑们掌握了文章的生杀大权。事实上，也是这样。
    向编辑部要求一些什么呢？一句话，要求尊重作家的劳动。对作家劳动的不尊重表现在许多方面。例如：不恰当地退稿，粗暴地删改稿件，好文章没有被强调，生硬地命题作文，等等都是。
    毛病产生的原因可能很多。最重要的一个原因，是我们一些同志没有体会“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针。
    做编辑工作的人大概都有这样一种心理，总希望自己办的刊物上马克思主义多一些；如果办的是文艺刊物，还希望发表的作品艺术水平高一些。当然，希望做到刊物上马克思主义多一些，艺术水平高一些，这想法不能说是错的。但是希望马克思主义多，而又不执行党的方针，刊物上不“放”不“鸣”，把马克思主义和党的方针对立起来，这样的马克思主义恐怕实际就是教条主义和宗派主义。想提高刊物的水平，而又不展开自由竞赛，自由讨论，这实际是做不到的。
    我觉得很可以怀疑一下我们心目中的“高水平”，到底是高还是低，是对还是错。我们所说的“高水平”常常免不了主观。我们常常把个人的爱好，个人在艺术上流派性同艺术的客观标准混淆起来了，因此常常只提倡一两种花，而排斥、抹杀了其他许多花。来稿如果不合乎我们自己定的那个标准，不是我们心目中的花，于是就来动手术。
    自己以为动机很好，效果却很糟。嫩芽固然经不起动锄头的手术，粗壮的大树也受不了斧锯的一再加工。任你如何加工，丁香还是不能放大成为牡丹，菊花还是不能变成睡莲。为了增加茶叶的香气，鲜花倒可以烘焙成为干花，但是花的生命已经没有了。
    当然，我这不是说从此不能改稿了。但是这是一个应该非常慎重对待的工作。编辑同志们还应该仔细研究一下，看今后对各种各样的来稿哪些方面该改，哪些方面不该改。对错字别字和错标点符号的修改，我以为是应该的，对语法不通，逻辑成问题，我以为也可以改。但是这个问题就复杂多了。因为有些我们看来是语法或逻辑的问题实际是风格的问题。对于作者的风格和文体，我以为无论如何是不应该去改的。文章啰嗦重复，似乎是应该帮助整理一下，但这也要很慎重。有一次会上，吴组缃同志说，陀斯妥也夫斯基文章看起来也很啰嗦，如果你要把他的文章改成像托尔斯太的文章一样简洁，他就不成其为陀斯妥也夫斯基了。我是同意吴组缃同志的意见的。
    对文章的思想内容，我以为不应该进行修改。刊物的编辑应当极力体会“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针，让更多的花放出来，但这决不是说编辑就不应该鉴别来稿，编辑部对来稿就没有取舍了。任何刊物都不能做到来稿一律照登的。编辑部对于某些稿子的思想内容实在不同意，我以为宁可退稿也比任意改变别人文章的思想内容好一些。改变别人文章的思想内容实际是代人作文。这种作法比任意退稿还粗暴，改稿人再辛苦一些也是不好的。文章被一个刊物退错了，还有可能在别的刊物上刊登出来，从全国范围看来，这一朵花最后还是“放”了。但是一篇文章被一个刊物改得面目全非，虽然在那刊物上登了出来，那一朵花实际上却被消灭了。
    编辑部应对一定时期刊物的全貌负责，不一定对每篇作品都担负具体责任，应适当地提倡“文责自负”。
    葛洛
    “人民文学”同作家们的关系是不够好的。我们听到一些作家对“人民文学”的反映，其中比较带普遍性的意见，是感到刊物的作风“老大”，有些“高不可攀”；感到刊物编辑部对他们不热情、不亲切。经过深入的检查，我们已经认识到：今后要把团结作家的工作作好，主要关键在于克服我们思想上的主观性、狭隘性以及工作态度的简单生硬不够虚心等等，也就是改变我们的“老大”作风。
    过去我们和作家们的接触很不够，组织稿件的工作很不活跃，特别是和老作家的接触不够多和不够普遍，没有经常地、积极地在老作家中间进行约稿的活动。当然，这也是有些客观原因的，比如：编辑部人手不多而工作繁重（每月都有千万字以上的来稿），经常感到人力不够支配；担任编辑工作的多是年轻同志，不习惯和老作家接触，但是，最基本的原因，仍在于我们没有把这方面的工作重视起来。
    我们对有些作家的来稿处理不当，又是使我们和某些作家发生隔阂的一个最主要的原因。由于我们思想上有着主观性和狭隘性，有不少本来是可用的稿件，都被我们认为不可用。有些作品在思想内容方面本来没有重大的毛病，却也被我们认为思想内容上有毛病。还有一些作品仅仅是因为表现手法、艺术风格不适合我们的欣赏趣味，因而也被退掉了。……我们这样做时，常常是出于一种“好心”，自以为是对读者负责，同时也是对作者负责。在写给作家的退稿信中，我们有时就这样写：“为着对你的爱护，我们觉得这篇作品还是不发表为好……”。作家接到这样的信件，只能是啼笑皆非的。
    对王蒙的小说作了错误的修改，这件事决不是偶然发生的，这个错误也决不是秦兆阳同志一个人的错误，它反映出在我们的工作上存在着的一个严重问题。本来，我们编辑部对于修改稿件曾经规定有这样的方针，即：对于可以不修改的稿件尽可能不修改，必须修改时尽可能提意见请作者自己修改，除了文字上的修改以外，经我们修改的稿件尽可能在发表前给作者看过，或者在取得作者的同意后再修改。这些办法虽不能说完全没有执行，但在实际工作中却执行得很不认真和很不彻底。特别当发稿急迫而稿件还很欠缺的情况下，往往就忘记了这个方针，因而就造成一些缺点和错误。经修改后发表的作品有时也会得到作者的一些好的反映，这就更加助长了我们的自满情绪。而在这种修改中所产生的缺点或错误，我们却不去正视，有时甚至已经受到作者的指责，却也没有引起我们的警惕。久而久之，这种对待稿件的不慎重、轻率、有时甚至是粗暴的态度，逐渐形成我们编辑工作上的一种极不好的作风。修改王蒙小说的事件给我们提供了一个严重的教训。
    最后，对今后的工作，提出几点我个人的意见：
    一、文学刊物本来负有两重的任务，一方面是团结广大的专业作家，一方面是从来稿中发现有才能的新作者，给以必要的帮助，为文学队伍输送新生力量。“人民文学”过去往往顾此失彼，使工作受到损失。今后必须注意到两方面。
    二、作家在刊物上发表了作品，作家和选用这篇作品的刊物对这篇作品当然都负有责任。但是，照过去的情况，刊物所分担的责任似乎太重，因而有些不合理（如一篇作品发现内容有错误时，作者作检讨，刊物也要作检讨）。我认为，编辑部应对一定时期的刊物面貌负责，不一定对每篇作品都担负具体责任。为着有利于“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针的贯彻，应该适当地提倡和宣传“文责自负”。
    三、因为文学作品的语言文字和思想内容、人物形象，以及艺术风格都是很难完全分开的，所以，我主张除了错别字和显然不通的句子以外，编辑对作品不要作所谓“文字上”的修改（如删节、压缩等等）。要改，必须和作者商量。
    “译文”今后应译载世界各国各种流派和风格的作品。
    陈冰夷
    “人民文学”编辑部修改王蒙小说原稿的问题，对于“译文”编辑部也有重大的教训意义，因为“译文”编辑部也帮助译作者修改稿子，在改稿工作中也存在着问题，也犯过错误。
    为了尽量减少原稿中可能有的疏忽和差错，同时也为了防止编辑部把原稿改错或者改坏，我们建立了一套校订加工整理定稿的编辑工作制度，而且规定修改原稿必须采取向译作者提意见的方式，请译作者自己修改或者取得他们同意后由编辑部修改。在帮助译作者校改原稿的工作上，编辑部花的力量是相当大的，但是在校改过程中还常常出偏差犯错误，有些译文本来是正确的，编辑部却把它改错了；也有些译文，可以这样译，也可以那样译，本来不过是译者本人的翻译方法或者译文风格的问题，编辑部却一定要把它们修改成自己的译法和文体，这样即使没有把译文改错，但是强制译者接受编辑部自己的译法和文体，也是不正确的，更严重的是，有时候原来比较好的有风格的译文被改坏了。在修改译者写的前言后记的时候，编辑部有时候强求译者在看法上，甚至在写法上同编辑部一致，不恰当地把译者的看法修改成编辑部所要求的那样。
    为了尊重作者和避免改错稿子，会上有的同志主张用实行“文责自负”的办法。我们编辑部也有同志提出这样的建议，从“译文”的工作来看，这样做恐怕也不是办法。一般说来，“文责”基本上是应该由作者“自负”的，译稿好坏，主要靠译者，编辑部帮助校改，照理只能起锦上添花的作用。但是也确实有些稿子，译得比较差，是由编辑部或者另外约请校订者作了较大的修改之后才发表的。这种做法原是不足为训的，可是为了应付版面的需要，编辑部常常不得不勉为其难。估计这种情况今后还是免不了会有。就是有修养的老翻译家的译作，所谓智者千虑，挂一漏万，也难免有疏忽不到之处，而且他们自己也大多希望编辑部对他们的原稿提意见。所以避免把稿子改错，还只是消极的一面，更重要的积极的一面是，在于编辑部如何同译作者亲密无间地友好合作，共同努力把稿子修改得更好。
    近年来有一种千篇一律、枯燥乏味的翻译文体，仅仅在字面上追求“忠实”于原著和斤斤较量中文语法的“通顺”。这种翻译文体之所以流行，原因当然很多，但是恐怕同编辑部工作中的缺点和问题也不能说完全没有关系。今后编辑部应该大胆放手地容许、甚至有意识地支持各种各样富有创造性的文学翻译艺术的尝试，而且要更多地提倡真正能够传达原著精神的、有风格有个性的、优美的艺术翻译。
    编辑工作有缺点，编辑人员也有苦恼，希望读者不要认为刊物上的文章都代表编辑部的意见。
    韦君宜
    当编辑的人这几年经常受人责备，经常都在检讨，停一下我还要检讨的。但是我也想：为什么我们这些人会这样经常喜欢犯错误呢？我们的错处，知道的人尽有。我们的苦恼，似乎也可以要求旁人了解了解。我想先把这些苦诉一诉，然后再作检讨。
    第一个，文责究竟是自负还是由编辑部代负的问题。应当是自负。但过去社会观感却不然，刊物上登出什么文章出了毛病，就怪编辑部。甚至在批评某篇有错误的文章时，根本不提作者名字，只提是在某某刊物上登出的。在对于不大知名的作者写的文章作批评时，尤其是如此。这样就不能不形成编辑在审稿时字斟句酌，遇到点不大对处就想改，好像对待自己的文章一样，因为要代他负责，出了岔子是编辑部的呀。
    第二个，除去要正确，要水平高，还得符合读者要求。群众性越大的刊物这一点越不能不管。遇到回答在广大读者中有普遍性的问题时，这一点就更突出，编辑部就易对文章苛求，想把它弄得适合大家的需要。
    第三个，不可能把一切来稿都发表。收到退稿的同志总不大满意。青年同志总批评编辑部是权威思想，老作家则批评为不团结老作家。在选稿上，确难说有绝对把握。编辑本人的文艺思想、艺术趣味、欣赏能力……对选稿都有影响，由于这许多原因我们确是犯错误不少。但批评的人则总是把问题提到编辑的政治品质上去，仿佛当编辑的人人都是毫无持操，崇拜权威，势利眼……，更使编辑觉得委屈。此外还有因刊物上发表了编辑自己的文章，也责骂编辑的。而事实上一些新作品的评论文章极难约到，编辑常是在不得已的情况下承乏。
    第四个，改稿的困难。到底改不改，是个大问题，青年投稿者都要求修改刊用，这当然不可能办到。编辑部就总想从中选一些有修改基础的，改一改来用。退给本人改改不好，常常就代他改了。这样一改，易出毛病，要不改，这些投稿能刊用的机会就会减少。这也是为难的问题。
    这些事情，是使我们常觉得苦恼的。当然，不能因为这就消除了我们的错误。我们错误不少，“文艺学习”在改稿上也犯过错误。为慎重起见，编辑部把某些文章送交好多同志去传阅，如果大家对其中一个论点不同意，执行的编辑为了“尊重集体领导”，就一定要求作者修改。这种做法，后来我们自己也知道是完全错误的。首先，编辑部的看法并不见得就正确，编辑部也不见得对读者情况有完全准确的估计。即使真是如此，登出一些口味不同意见不同的文章对读者也是只有好处的。我们的年轻读者读同一口味同一意图的文章实在太多了，致使许多人简直不大知道世上还有别种文章，使他们目光狭窄，思想停滞，丧失了判别力。在约稿上我们也有个流行的办法，即“命题而且命意”。觉得最近有什么该谈的问题了，就去找作者。方式好些的是供给材料，引导他往这面想，方式差的简直代他设计，要他达到编辑部的要求。往往你觉得某一倾向应当反对，而作者并未感到如此，或者并无很深感触，一定要他写，焉能写好？
    要克服以上缺点是有困难的，当编辑的人还会有些思想不能完全搞通，我们也要克服。同时，我们也希望社会上一些看法能够改变。读者常认为刊物上的文章都代表编辑部的意见，有些作者也习惯于这样写作，这是要逐渐改变的。
    “包办代替”式的修改难免不把编者的主观意图强加于作者。

    “北京文艺”是地方性的刊物，广大读者要求它带有北京的地方色彩和北京味，要求多反映首都的生活。为此我们应当广泛地团结好北京的作家和作者们，但是做得相当不够。在开初阶段，由于我们比较硬性规定了：每期刊登一定分量的反映北京的和北京工人作品，作为首要的任务，当稿源不充足时，便往往采取了“改”稿的办法来弥补。有时，为了字数，也不得不改。对于那些有丰富的生活基础而艺术性较差的稿件，就不忍割爱了，但是原封不动，又用不出去，于是我们便亲自动手改用了。这样做，绝大多数是征求过作者同意的，对于培养和辅导群众作者，也起到一定的作用。但是，由于我们在改稿方面，还存在着主观主义单纯任务观点和粗枝大叶的作风，我们也犯过错误和闹过笑话：比如我们收到过一篇小说，是以松花江做背景的，为了要加上北京地方色彩，于是没征求作者同意，一开始把场景由东北改到北京了：“在北京一个机械厂里，有个女检查员……”，可是改来改去，并没“坚持”到底，末尾一段，仍旧保留着：“秋天的风，刮的真紧，吹着松花江的水……”，一直到付排、付型，我们都没检查出这一自相矛盾处，刊物印出来以后，读者纷纷来信提出质问。
    又比如对于青年们的来稿，编辑部给以慎审适当的修改，也未尝不可。但是有时，一篇稿子在初看时，就边看边改，甚至是信笔一挥。
    有时，则采用了包办代替式的修改，给原作加上许多所没有的东西，弄得面目全非，虽然在事前征求过作者同意，作品刊出后，作者也来信申谢过（我们知道，有些“同意”和“申谢”都是出于勉强的心情），可是后来越想越觉得不对头。因为这种包办代替式的修改难免不把编者主观的东西，强加给作者，对于青年作者，是会有不良的副作用的：第一，是助长了青年作者的依赖心理；另一种情况是：某一篇作品，本来还只是个半成品，没达到在刊物发表的水平，只是经过编辑部人为的“加工”而发表了，等到别的刊物看到他发表了作品，也来向他拉稿，甚或把他当成作家看待。
    除以上有待克服的缺点外，在处理某些有争论的稿件上，我们还存在着“缺乏独立思考”和缩手缩脚的毛病。比如“傻子”这篇小说，是在1955年“北京文艺”创刊号刊登的，当初编辑部是肯定它的。后来收到一篇署名星火的批评文章，我们认为批评有过火和不恰当的地方，久没发表，及至负责同志提出了对“傻子”的批评，指出了其中有自然主义的倾向，我们才慌手慌脚地把星火同志的文章发表出来，认为可以免得检讨了。后来，有些读者来信，对星火同志的文章，提出意见：认为这种批评是粗暴的，我们又赶忙组织了一篇文章批评星火同志。这当中，就难看到编辑的主见是什么，编辑部的“底”在哪里？所以使然，主要是编辑部怕挨批评，怕犯错误，实际上，这样缩手缩脚、摇摆不定的做法本身，就是错误的，是不利于“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的。
    编辑部应该清除主观主义思想、宗派情绪和老爷作风。

    编辑部原是作家和读者之间的桥梁。以我们编辑部说，这种桥梁作用已在逐渐消失。原因是这几年来，我们滋长了一种自满情绪，作家给不给刊物写稿，读者喜爱不喜爱这份刊物，已经满不在乎，这样，编辑部既不了解作家，也不了解读者，选择稿件以至组织稿件，常常出于个人爱好。
    “新观察”编辑部和作家的关系是很不密切的。编辑部过去有片面的群众观点，强调登载一般业余写作者的来稿，这自然是需要的，但过分地强调了这一方面，无形中疏远了作家。结果刊物的质量受到严重影响。
    为什么这样做呢？
    这是由于编辑部对作家有过不正确的看法，觉得他们（特别是大作家）不易接近，不好说话，对他们的稿件难于处理。业余写作者则相反，可以出题目写文章，可以随便退稿，可以任意删改他们的稿件。其实这是一种权威思想。
    实际上我们编辑部对作家、其他方面的专家以及画家等有时也很傲慢。有的作家主动寄来的稿件和画，或是约请他们写的画的，不经过慎重的考虑退回了。有的三四千字的文章，不得作者同意删成一千字发表。有读者对某篇文章指出错误，不和原作者商量，刊登来信，等到原作者提出不同意见，却又不再刊登了。有时对作家的稿件提出不合适的要求请他修改，有的作家的稿件，长时间积压，最后失去时效……。
    这种严重的不负责的现象，对业余作者也时有发生，甚至有遗失作者原稿和照片底片的。
    诸如此类的严重问题，急需改正，只有编辑部清除了主观主义思想、宗派情绪和老爷作风，才能把刊物办好。
    自然，在另一方面编辑部也有困难和苦衷，如水平低，知识不丰富，来稿多，读者要求高，编辑工作不受重视等等，但这些都不能算作主要问题。重要的是如何进一步和作家团结起来办好刊物，以利于贯彻“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针。
