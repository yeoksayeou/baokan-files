    Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, May 28th: The Presidium of the Great People's Hural, the Council of Ministers, and the Central Committee of the People's Revolutionary Party of Mongolia held a grand banquet on the evening of May 27th to welcome Chairman Voroshilov.
    Accompanied by Sambu and others, Voroshilov arrived at the brightly lit hall of the Government Building and was warmly welcomed by Mongolian state leaders and foreign envoys attending the banquet.
    Voroshilov said at the banquet that we were very excited when we were about to visit your country, and we were even more excited after receiving a grand send-off in Beijing. Upon arriving here, we felt like we were seeing our relatives. The friendship between the Mongolian and Soviet people has been established since the first day of the Mongolian revolution. Here, we must mention Lenin's words that backward countries can transition to the socialist system by bypassing capitalism with the help of the proletariat of advanced countries. This sentence has already been realized in Mongolia. The Mongolian people actively participate in the cause of peace and strive to strengthen unity with the Soviet Union, China, and other people's democratic countries. We are happy for the achievements made by the Mongolian people.
    Sambu, on behalf of the Mongolian people, once again warmly welcomed Voroshilov. He said that Voroshilov, a faithful student of Lenin and an outstanding activist of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, will further consolidate our friendship based on the equality of large and small countries and proletarian internationalism by visiting Mongolia. Sambu pointed out that the success of the Mongolian-Soviet talks shows how much the Communist Party and government of the Soviet Union care about the Mongolian people. He said that with the help of the Soviet Union, China, and other fraternal countries, the Mongolian people will achieve greater achievements.
    After the banquet, Voroshilov went to the National Theater to watch a song and dance performance.
    Before attending the banquet, Voroshilov also went to the Zaisan Memorial on the outskirts of Ulaanbaatar to lay a wreath at the Soviet Army Martyrs Monument.

    蒙古领导人欢宴伏老
    宾主畅谈蒙苏友谊
    新华社乌兰巴托28日电　蒙古大人民呼拉尔主席团、部长会议和人民革命党中央委员会，5月27日晚上举行盛大宴会欢迎伏罗希洛夫主席。
    伏罗希洛夫在桑布等陪同下来到政府大厦灯光辉煌的大厅，受到出席宴会的蒙古国家领导人和外国使节的热烈欢迎。
    伏罗希洛夫在宴会上讲话说，我们要来你们国家访问时，心里很激动，加上在北京受到盛大的欢送，就更加激动了。到达这里，我们像见到了亲人。从蒙古革命胜利的第一天起，蒙苏人民就建立了友谊。我们在这里不能不提起列宁所说的落后国家受到先进国家无产阶级的帮助，就可以越过资本主义过渡到社会主义制度的话，这句话已经在蒙古实现。蒙古人民积极地参加和平事业，并且努力加强同苏联、中国及其它人民民主国家的团结。我们为蒙古人民取得的成就感到高兴。
    桑布代表蒙古人民又一次热烈地欢迎伏罗希洛夫。他说，列宁忠实的学生、苏联共产党杰出的活动家伏罗希洛夫到蒙古来访问，将更加巩固大小国家平等和在无产阶级国际主义基础上建立起来的我们的友谊。桑布指出，蒙苏会谈的成功，说明苏联共产党和政府对蒙古人民是如何的关心。他说，在苏联、中国和其它兄弟国家帮助下，蒙古人民将获得更大的成就。
    宴会结束以后，伏罗希洛夫到国家剧院观看了歌舞表演。
    在出席宴会以前，伏罗希洛夫还到乌兰巴托市郊的寨桑山头向苏军烈士纪念塔献了花圈。
