Several Issues to Note When Entrusting Foreign Countries to Design Water Conservancy Projects: Excerpts from a Speech by Committee Member Wang Huzhen

The Sanmenxia Project on the Yellow River is the first water conservancy project in our country entrusted to a foreign country for design. It is said that our country plans to entrust more water conservancy projects with hydropower stations to foreign countries for design in the future, in order to absorb foreign strengths and strengthen our country's water conservancy science. Therefore, I believe it is necessary to present five issues that must be noted based on the experience gained from entrusting the Sanmenxia project to a foreign country for design.

First, projects that can be designed domestically should not be entrusted to foreign countries. Several high dams, large-scale spillway gates, and a number of hydroelectric power stations completed in our country in recent years have been able to combine the actual conditions of our country at the time and local conditions in engineering design, and select suitable materials and structures. Thus, they have been able to complete the construction mission with relatively little investment. In terms of construction, they have been able to utilize a portion of machinery and manpower in an organic coordination, enabling the projects to be completed rapidly in a short period. In the practical work of the past six or seven years, we have cultivated a large group of design talents, who are full of confidence to design larger-scale water conservancy projects for our country. Therefore, I suggest that before planning to entrust water conservancy projects to foreign countries for design in the future, we should first understand the domestic design capabilities. Only when it is indeed a design that the country does not have the capacity to undertake should it be entrusted to foreign countries.

Second, if possible, experts should be invited to China for design. There is no doubt that modestly absorbing foreign strengths, digesting them, and using them to improve our country's technical and scientific level in water conservancy engineering is the direction our country should strive for at present. However, the so-called absorption of foreign strengths mainly requires our technical personnel to learn foreign skills. In this way, after a few years, we will have the ability to work independently, without needing to ask masters for help everywhere.

Of course, some people will say that when designing abroad, our country can send a large number of technical personnel to participate, wouldn't that be the same as learning skills? In fact, in reality, the number of people sent will not be very large. Taking Sanmenxia as an example, only two people were sent, and it is easy to understand that the learning scope is not broad. If experts were invited to China, several foreign experts could lead the entire design of the Sanmenxia project. Using the master-apprentice method, I don't know how many design talents can be created for our country. In the future, if possible, inviting experts to China to teach would be more beneficial than entrusting design to foreign countries.

Third, before entrusting design to foreign countries, it is necessary to understand the foreign technology. The growth of a country's technology and science is inseparable from its environmental conditions and historical traditions. Even within a country, each design institution has its own strengths and weaknesses. Therefore, before entrusting foreign countries to design water conservancy projects, it is necessary to find out whether this design institution is suitable for the project proposed by our country.

The methods used to shorten construction time and reduce costs in the water conservancy projects that our country has already completed cannot be found in similar design experience abroad, and their design experience is often not applicable to our country. Taking the Sanmenxia project as an example, it has many characteristics. Only by applying the experience extracted from our country's existing engineering practice can we achieve the goal of being good, fast, and economical.

Fourth, before entrusting design to foreign countries, it is necessary to do a good job in planning. All water conservancy projects will not be built on uninhabited land, and will inevitably cause some social problems that conflict with the interests of the people; it cannot be separated from the ground and become a castle in the air, and many problems involving hydrology, topography, geology, and other natural aspects will inevitably occur. The water conservancy planning that needs to be done before design is to seek a dialectical unity of the existing contradictions between society and nature.

Although a technical and economic report on controlling the Yellow River flood and developing Yellow River water conservancy was done before the design of the Sanmenxia project, it was too broad in content to be used as a basis for individual projects. During the entrustment of the design, various departments separately proposed flood control standards, the time limit for the effectiveness of soil and water conservation work, the area of irrigated cultivated land, and the power requirements of the Sanmen area. These conditions made it impossible for the high water level of the reservoir to exceed the regulations of the technical and economic report, which caused new contradictions. It is well known that the water level is determined by the design conditions. Without an overall plan to unify the contradictions, and with scattered and one-sided design conditions, a chaotic result will inevitably be created.

In the future, entrusting foreign countries to design water conservancy projects (in fact, the same is true for domestic design) must take Sanmenxia as a lesson from the past and do a good job in engineering planning in advance.

Fifth, domestic parallel design must be carried out during foreign design. In order to improve our country's scientific and technological level, it is necessary to organize technical personnel to carry out parallel design domestically while the design is being done abroad.

During the design of a project, many new scientific problems that have not been solved can certainly be encountered. In the pioneering Sanmenxia project, the number of such problems is even greater. In order to solve these problems, foreign countries have mobilized many scientific research institutions and universities to conduct research and experiments. The important scientific reports have reached more than ten, and the huge amount of labor spent can be imagined. However, as far as our country is concerned, we only ask others to work for us. We do nothing ourselves, and as a result, we gain nothing. In the future, if our country needs to entrust foreign countries to design water conservancy projects, we must simultaneously organize forces domestically to carry out parallel design. All experiments, research, analysis, and calculations must be done using our own strength. This will not only enable our country's design capabilities to be improved, but also facilitate mutual comparison when reviewing foreign designs.

The above five points are my opinions on how to correctly handle the entrustment of foreign countries to design water conservancy projects in the future. I hope that the relevant departments will pay attention to them.

    委托国外设计水利工程必须注意的几个问题
    汪胡桢委员发言摘要
    黄河三门峡工程是我国第一个委托国外设计的水利工程。据说我国今后还打算把更多的附有水力发电站的水利工程委托国外去设计，以期吸收外国的长处来壮大我国的水利科学。故我认为有必要就三门峡工程委托外国设计所得的经验提出五个必须注意的问题。
    第一、国内能够设计的不应委托国外。我国在最近这几年里建设完成的几个高坝，大型泄水闸，和若干水利发电站，在工程设计上都能结合我国当时的和当地的实际情况，选择合适的材料和结构，故能以比较少的投资来完成建设的使命。在施工上大都能利用一部分的机械和人力作有机的配合，使工程能在短时期里迅速完成。在这六、七年里的实践工作中，我们已经培养出一大群设计人材，他们满怀信心要为我国设计规模更大的水利工程。因此我建议今后打算把水利工程委托国外设计以前应先把国内设计力量摸一个底，倘确是国内没有能力担任的设计才应当委托国外去做。
    第二、如属可能应邀请专家来华设计。毫无疑问，虚心地吸收外国的长处加以消化，用来提高我国在水利工程上的技术科学水平是我国当前应当努力的方向。但所谓吸收外国的长处主要是要求我国的技术人员学会外国的本领。这样，几年以后，我们才有本领来独立工作，不需要处处要师傅来帮助。
    当然有人会说在国外进行设计时，我国可以派遣大批的技术人员去参加，不是一样可以学到本领么？其实在事实上派去的人数不会很多的。以三门峡而论，派去的只有二人，学习面不广是可以意会得到的。倘邀请专家来华，三门峡工程能有外国专家数人已可领导全部设计。用师傅带徒弟的方式真不知可为我国造就多少设计人才。今后如属可能邀请专家来华教导当比委托国外设计为有益。
    第三、委托国外设计须先摸清外国技术的底。一个国家技术科学的成长离不开它的环境情况和历史传统。就是一国里边，各个设计机构也各有擅长的薄弱的部门。所以委托国外设计水利工程以前，必须摸清这个设计机构是不是适宜于我国提出的工程。
    我国已经完成的水利工程用什么方法来缩短施工时间，用什么方法来减省费用，在国外就找不到同类的设计经验，而他们的设计经验对于我国也常常用不上去。以三门峡工程为例，它的特点很多，只有应用从我国现有的工程实践中提炼出来的经验，才可达到既好且快又省的目标。
    第四、委托国外设计须先做好规划。一切水利工程都不会建设在荒无人烟的土地上，就必然要引起多少和人民利益相冲突的社会问题；它也不能脱离地面而成为空中的楼阁，必然要发生许多牵涉水文、地形、地质等自然界的问题。在设计以前要做的水利规划就是要把存在着的社会和自然界矛盾求得辩证的统一。
    三门峡工程在设计前虽然做过根治黄河水患开发黄河水利的技术经济报告，但因内容过于广泛，不可能作为个别工程的依据。在委托设计时才由各部门分别提出防洪标准，水土保持工作发生成效的年限，灌溉耕地的面积，三门地区的电力要求等。由于这些条件使得水库的高水位不能不超过技术经济报告的规定，这就引起了新的矛盾。殊不知水位是设计条件所决定的，没有统一矛盾的总体规划，而分散的片面的提设计条件，势必造成紊乱的结果。
    今后委托国外设计水利工程（其实在国内设计也是如此的）必须以三门峡为前车之鉴，在事前做好工程的规划。
    第五、在国外设计时国内须进行平行设计。为了提高我国的科学技术水平，在国外设计的同时在国内组织技术人员进行平行设计是必要的。
    一个工程在设计的时候，一定可以遇到许多科学上没有解决过的新问题。在拓荒性质的三门峡工程，这种问题为数更多。为了解决这种问题，国外曾动员不少科学研究机构和高等院校进行研究和试验，重要的科学报告就达到十余种之多，所费的劳动量的巨大也可以想见的。但就我国而言，则只叫别人为我们劳动。自己既一无所事，结果也一无所得。今后我国倘有委托国外设计水利工程的必要，必须同时在国内组织力量，进行平行设计。一切试验、研究、分析、计算，必须用自己力量同样搞一套。这不但使我国设计能力能够提高，也可在审核国外设计时获得互相校对的便利。
    以上五点为我对于今后如何正确处理有关委托国外设计水利工程的意见，希望有关方面加以注意。
