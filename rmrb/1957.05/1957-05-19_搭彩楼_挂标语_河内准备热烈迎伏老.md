    Building Decorated Arches, Hanging Banners
    Hanoi Prepares a Warm Welcome for Voroshilov
    Xinhua News Agency Report: According to a Xinhua News Agency dispatch, the Presidential Palace of Vietnam issued a communique on the 18th stating that Marshal Voroshilov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, is scheduled to arrive in Hanoi on the morning of May 20, 1957.
    The Vietnamese capital is currently preparing to receive Soviet Head of State Chairman Voroshilov, who is about to visit Vietnam, in the most solemn and enthusiastic manner.
    Along the route from Gia Lam Airport in the suburbs to the Presidential Palace, decorated arches are being built, and preparations are underway to hang the national flags of Vietnam and the Soviet Union, as well as large banners. Almost all districts, organizations, factories, and schools have established special welcome committees to actively prepare for the welcome.
    On May 15, the Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front issued a communique stating that Chairman Voroshilov's visit to Vietnam will not only further strengthen the close friendship between the Vietnamese and Soviet peoples, but will also further consolidate the solidarity between the peoples of socialist countries and the firm forces of world peace and democracy.
    In recent days, Hanoi newspapers have continuously published lengthy articles and photos introducing the Soviet Union and the life of Voroshilov, including a photo of Ho Chi Minh with Voroshilov taken during Ho's visit to the Soviet Union in 1954. In the past few days, Hanoi has held several report meetings introducing the achievements of Soviet construction and the friendly relations between Vietnam and the Soviet Union. Each meeting has been attended by thousands of people.

    搭彩楼　挂标语
    河内准备热烈迎伏老
    本报综合报道　据新华社消息：越南主席府18日发表公报说：苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席伏罗希洛夫元帅定1957年5月20日上午抵达河内。
    目前越南首都正在准备最隆重和最热烈地接待即将到越南访问的苏联元首伏罗希洛夫主席。
    从郊外的嘉林机场到主席府的沿路上，正在修搭彩楼和准备悬挂越苏两国国旗和大幅标语。各区、各机关、工厂、学校几乎都成立了专门的欢迎委员会来积极准备欢迎。
    越南祖国战线中央委员会5月15日发表公报说，伏罗希洛夫主席访问越南，不仅进一步加强越苏人民之间的亲密友谊，并且进一步地巩固社会主义国家人民之间的团结和世界和平民主的坚定力量。
    河内各报连日来不断以大量篇幅刊登介绍苏联、介绍伏罗希洛夫生平的文章和照片，其中有胡志明在1954年访问苏联的时候同伏罗希洛夫合拍的像片。河内几天来已经举行多次报告会，介绍苏联建设成就和越苏友好关系。每次都有上千的人参加。
