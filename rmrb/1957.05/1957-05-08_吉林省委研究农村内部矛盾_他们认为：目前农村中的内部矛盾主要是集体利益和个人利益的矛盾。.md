    Jilin Provincial Party Committee Studies Internal Rural Contradictions
    They Believe the Main Internal Contradictions in Rural Areas are Currently Those Between Collective and Individual Interests.
    (This newspaper dispatch) The Jilin Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, after recently studying Chairman Mao's speech at the Supreme State Conference, specifically analyzed the current internal contradictions among the people in the rural areas of Jilin Province and studied specific measures to correctly handle these contradictions.
    Everyone believes that the current internal contradictions in rural areas are mainly contradictions between collective and individual interests. Specific manifestations are as follows:
    First, contradictions between the state, cooperatives, and members. For example, after the realization of agricultural cooperation last year, the needs of the state were simply emphasized, the independent management of agricultural cooperatives was ignored, and the principle of adapting to local conditions was not earnestly implemented; some agricultural cooperatives overemphasized unified management and multiple high-yield crops, ignoring the production of coarse grains necessary for the daily life of farmers, and restricting the working hours and household sideline occupations of members too rigidly. This year, after emphasizing the principle of adapting to local conditions, some places have neglected the planting area of economic crops such as soybeans and sugar beets needed by the state.
    Second, contradictions between members. Such as the contradiction between rich middle peasants and poor peasants, the contradiction between poor villages and rich villages, the contradiction between ethnic minority members and Han members, and so on.
    Third, contradictions between cooperative cadres and members. For example, during the rectification of agricultural cooperatives, these cooperative cadres reflected that their remuneration was low, which caused them to consider changing jobs; however, members had strong opinions about cooperative cadres not participating in productive labor, thinking that "black hands earn money, white hands spend it." In particular, some cooperative cadres have undemocratic work styles, the democratic system of agricultural cooperatives is unsound, and the voices and difficulties of members cannot be resolved in a timely manner, causing dissatisfaction among members. On the member side, there is an overemphasis on democratic freedom, making it difficult for cadres to carry out their work.
    In addition, contradictions have also occurred between cooperatives, such as disputes over grasslands, pastures, sideline conditions, and water sources.
    In order to correctly handle the internal contradictions among the people in rural areas, the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has put forward four specific measures. First, overcome the bureaucratic work style of rural leaders, earnestly implement the policy of running cooperatives democratically, strengthen the ties between cadres and members, and improve the democratic management system of agricultural cooperatives. Second, party organizations at all levels must strengthen education on the consistency of collective and individual interests and democratic centralism for members, publicize the party's various policies and guidelines, and improve members' political and ideological awareness. Third, do everything possible to strive for a bumper harvest in agricultural production this year, strive to complete and overfulfill the province's task of producing six million tons of grain this year, and do a good job in distribution on the basis of increased production. Fourth, in order to adjust the relationship between the state, cooperatives, and members politically and economically, we must earnestly implement and inspect the party's various policies in rural areas.

    吉林省委研究农村内部矛盾
    他们认为：目前农村中的内部矛盾主要是集体利益和个人利益的矛盾。
    本报讯　中共吉林省委最近在学习了毛主席在最高国务会议上的讲话以后，具体分析了吉林省当前农村人民内部的矛盾，并且研究了正确处理这些矛盾的具体措施。
    大家认为：目前农村中的内部矛盾主要是集体利益和个人利益的矛盾。具体表现如下：
    第一，国家、合作社和社员之间的矛盾。如去年实现农业合作化以后，曾经单纯强调了国家的需要，忽视了农业社的经营独立性，没有认真贯彻因地制宜的原则；有些农业社过分强调了统一经营和多种高产作物，忽视了农民日常生活所必需的杂粮生产，对社员的劳动时间、家庭副业也限制得过死。今年，强调因地制宜的原则以后，有些地方却又忽视了国家所需要的大豆、甜菜等经济作物播种面积。
    第二，社员之间的矛盾。如富裕中农与贫农之间的矛盾，穷屯与富屯之间的矛盾，少数民族社员与汉族社员之间的矛盾等等。
    第三，社干部和社员之间的矛盾。如在整顿农业社时，这些社干部反映报酬少，产生了换肩思想；但是，社干部不参加生产劳动，社员们很有意见，认为是：“黑手挣钱，白手花”。特别是有些社干部作风不民主，农业社的民主制度不健全，社员们的呼声和困难不能得到及时解决，引起社员的不满。在社员方面，则过分强调民主自由，使干部难于进行工作。
    此外，社与社之间，也发生过争草原、争牧场、争副业条件、争水源的矛盾。
    为了正确处理农村人民内部的矛盾，中共吉林省委提出了四项具体措施。首先要克服农村领导的官僚主义作风，切实贯彻民主办社的方针，密切干部与社员的联系，健全农业社的民主管理制度。第二，各级党的组织，要加强对社员的集体利益与个人利益一致性的教育和民主集中制的教育，宣传党的各种方针政策，提高社员的政治思想觉悟。第三，想尽一切办法争取今年农业生产的大丰收，争取完成和超额完成全省今年生产六百万吨粮食的任务，并且在增产的基础上，做好分配工作。第四，为了从政治、经济上调整国家、合作社、社员之间的关系，要认真执行和检查党在农村的各项政策。
