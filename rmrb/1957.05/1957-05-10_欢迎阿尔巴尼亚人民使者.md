Welcome Envoys of the Albanian People

    The Albanian People's Assembly delegation, headed by Comrade Marko, arrived in Beijing yesterday to begin a friendly visit to our country. This friendly visit by the delegation will help strengthen mutual understanding and friendly cooperation between the Chinese and Albanian people. Our people will welcome the guests from the Adriatic coast as if they were our own brothers, and take this opportunity to once again express our deep friendship for the Albanian people.
    Geographically speaking, Albania is one of the most distant brother countries from us. However, as early as the Second World War, the Chinese people recognized the Albanian people in the common struggle against fascist aggression, and were inspired by their heroic and tenacious spirit of resistance. After the people of both countries achieved revolutionary victories, a bridge of friendship began to be built between our two countries, located at the two ends of Eurasia. This bridge is not an ordinary bridge, but is built with our common guiding ideology, common goals of struggle, and our profound friendship like that of brothers.
    In recent years, the friendly relations between the Chinese and Albanian people have developed rapidly and become increasingly close. Today, our two countries are conducting fraternal friendly cooperation in political, economic, and cultural fields. The relations between our two countries fully embody the principles of equality, mutual benefit and mutual respect, and embody the proletarian internationalist spirit of unity, cooperation and mutual support. We have common views and a common language on issues related to socialist construction and many major international issues. In recent years, our two countries have sent many delegations and individual representatives to each other, and have introduced each other to the situation and experience of socialist construction in our two countries. Some of our Party and government leaders have visited Albania. In January of this year, the delegation of the National People's Congress of our country paid a friendly visit to Albania and was warmly welcomed and received by the Albanian people. We have also received many distinguished Albanian guests, including Albanian state leaders such as Comrades Hoxha and Shehu, on our own soil. All of these have effectively enhanced the friendship and cooperation between the people of our two countries. The Albanian People's Assembly delegation's visit to our country will undoubtedly make new contributions in this regard. It brings the brotherly friendship of the Albanian people to the Chinese people, and will also bring back the care and friendship of our people to the fraternal Albanian people after the visit.
    May is a beautiful season when flowers are in full bloom in our country; our social and political life is developing vigorously. The Chinese people feel particularly happy and excited to receive the distinguished Albanian guests at such a time. Their friendly visit to our country will not only further strengthen the unbreakable brotherly friendship between the people of our two countries, but also provide an opportunity to exchange experiences in socialist construction between our two peoples. We warmly welcome the criticisms and opinions of the Albanian comrades who have achieved great success and much experience in socialist construction. We believe that this exchange of views is also one of the ways to enhance understanding and cooperation between socialist countries.
    We sincerely wish the envoys of the Albanian people a complete success in this visit; and wish the brotherly friendship between the Chinese and Albanian people to be constantly consolidated and developed.

    欢迎阿尔巴尼亚人民使者
    以马尔科同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚人民议会代表团，已于昨天抵达北京，开始对我国进行友好访问。代表团的这次友好访问，将有助于加强中阿两国人民的相互了解和友好合作。我国人民将像欢迎亲兄弟那样来欢迎从亚得里亚海畔远道前来的嘉宾，并且乘此机会再一次表示对阿尔巴尼亚人民的深情厚谊。
    从地理上来说，阿尔巴尼亚是距离我们最遥远的兄弟国家之一。但是，早在第二次世界大战期间，中国人民就已在反对法西斯侵略的共同斗争中认识了阿尔巴尼亚人民，并从他们英勇顽强的抗敌精神中得到了鼓舞。在两国人民都取得了革命胜利以后，地处欧亚两端的我们两国之间，就开始架设起友谊的桥梁。这座桥梁不是普通的桥梁，而是用我们共同的指导思想，共同的奋斗目标，用我们情同手足的深厚友谊建立起来的。
    这几年来，中阿两国人民的友好关系已获得了迅速的发展，并且越来越密切了。今天无论在政治、经济或文化方面，我们两国都进行着兄弟般的友好合作。我们两国的关系充分地体现了平等互利和相互尊重的原则，体现了团结合作和相互支持的无产阶级国际主义精神。在有关社会主义建设的问题和许多重大的国际问题上，我们有着共同的见解和共同的语言。这几年来，我们两国曾经相互派遣了许多代表团和个别代表性人物，相互介绍了两国社会主义建设的情况和经验。我国的一些党政领导人员曾经访问了阿尔巴尼亚。今年1月，我全国人民代表大会代表团到阿尔巴尼亚进行友好访问，受到阿尔巴尼亚人民热情的欢迎和接待。我们也曾经在自己的国土上接待过包括阿尔巴尼亚国家领导人霍查、谢胡等同志在内的许多阿尔巴尼亚贵宾。所有这些，都有效地增进了我们两国人民的友谊和合作。阿尔巴尼亚人民议会代表团这次来访问我国，无疑在这方面也将作出新的贡献。它带来了阿尔巴尼亚全国人民对中国人民的兄弟友谊，也将在访问以后带去我国人民对阿尔巴尼亚兄弟人民的关怀和情谊。
    5月，在我国正是百花盛开的美好的季节；我国社会政治生活正在生动活泼地向前发展着。中国人民在这样的时候接待阿尔巴尼亚贵宾们，特别感到愉快和兴奋。他们这次来我国进行友好访问，不仅将进一步加强我们两国人民的牢不可破的兄弟友谊，而且可以乘此机会交流我们两国人民社会主义建设的经验。我们十分欢迎曾经在社会主义建设中获得巨大成就和许多经验的阿尔巴尼亚同志的批评和意见。我们相信，这种意见的交换，也是增进社会主义国家之间的了解和合作的方式之一。
    我们谨祝阿尔巴尼亚人民的使者在这次访问中获得完满的成功；祝中阿两国人民的兄弟友谊不断巩固和发展。
