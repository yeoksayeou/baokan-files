    Xinhua News Agency, May 25th: Paris dispatch: French troops in Algeria continue to fight the Algerian National Liberation Army. Algerian guerrillas have also intensified their activities in recent days, attacking French troops in the Tablat area. In the fighting, twenty-five French soldiers and fifteen guerrillas were killed. The guerrillas also carried out a series of attacks on French military facilities and transportation lines.
    Moulay Merbah, Secretary-General of the "Algerian National Movement Party" (one of the organizations participating in the Algerian people's national liberation struggle), which passed through Rome, said at a press conference for Italian and foreign journalists on the 23rd that although the United Nations General Assembly had already adopted a proposal for a peaceful resolution of the Algerian question three months ago, the war is still going on in Algeria, and hundreds of peaceful residents are being sacrificed daily under the bullets of French soldiers. By the beginning of this year, the number of people sacrificed under repression in Algeria has reached 300,000.
    Xinhua News Agency, May 25th: Washington dispatch: The ambassadors of eleven Arab countries to the United States jointly requested on May 24th that the United States stop all economic and military aid to France, because this aid has been used by France to pursue colonial policies.
    The ambassadors of these eleven countries are the ambassadors of Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Tunisia, Morocco, Iraq, Sudan, Saudi Arabia, and Libya, as well as the chargés d'affaires of Jordan and Yemen. They made this request during a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Dulles.

    阿尔及利亚人民继续战斗
    阿拉伯国家要求美国停止对法援助
    据新华社25日讯　巴黎消息：阿尔及利亚境内的法军继续和阿尔及利亚民族解放军战斗。阿尔及利亚的游击队最近几天也加强了活动，他们在塔布拉区袭击法国军队。在战斗中有二十五名法军和十五名游击队员被打死。游击队还对法军的军事设施和交通线进行了一连串的袭击。
    路经罗马的“阿尔及利亚民族运动党”（参加阿尔及利亚人民民族解放斗争的组织之一）的总书记穆莱·默巴23日在为意大利和外国记者举行的记者招待会上说，尽管在三个月前联合国大会已经通过了和平解决阿尔及利亚问题的建议，但是战争仍然在阿尔及利亚进行，每天都有成百的和平居民在法国兵的子弹下牺牲。到今年年初为止，在阿尔及利亚牺牲于镇压之下的人数已经达到三十万人。
    据新华社25日讯　华盛顿消息：十一个阿拉伯国家的驻美使节5月24日联合要求美国停止对法国的一切经济和军事援助，因为这些援助一直被法国用来推行殖民政策。
    这十一个国家的使节是埃及、叙利亚、黎巴嫩、突尼斯、摩洛哥、伊拉克、苏丹、沙特阿拉伯和利比亚的大使以及约旦和也门的代办。他们在同美国国务卿杜勒斯会谈时提出了这个要求。
