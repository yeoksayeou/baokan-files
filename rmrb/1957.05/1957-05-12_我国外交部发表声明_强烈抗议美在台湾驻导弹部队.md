Chinese Foreign Ministry Statement
May 11, 1957

On May 7, 1957, the United States announced that it would station US Air Force units equipped with missiles in Taiwan, Chinese territory. On May 8, US military personnel invading Taiwan announced that the advance troops of the missile units had arrived in Taiwan. This is another serious provocative act by the US government in its policy of persistently pursuing aggression against China and intensifying tensions in the Far East. The Chinese government and the Chinese people express great indignation at this and lodge a strong protest.

People all over the world are demanding the easing of international tensions and the realization of the principle of peaceful coexistence in international relations. For a long time, the US occupation of Taiwan has created tension in the Taiwan area. The Chinese government has always advocated easing and eliminating tensions in the Taiwan area through peaceful negotiations, and has made many efforts to this end. Taiwan is Chinese territory, and the liberation of Taiwan is China's internal affair. On this internal affair, the Chinese government has repeatedly called for striving for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan.

However, the US government has not only refused to conduct serious negotiations on the issue of tension in the Taiwan area, but has also intensified its control over Taiwan in every possible way, deliberately obstructing and undermining the Chinese people's own solution to the internal problem of liberating Taiwan. The provocative act of the United States in stationing missile units in Taiwan not only exposes the aggressive and bellicose nature of the US policy of setting up missiles in various parts of the world in order to create tension, but also clearly shows the conspiracy to completely turn Taiwan into a US dominion and atomic war base.

The Chinese government solemnly declares that the Chinese people's determination to liberate their territory of Taiwan is unshakable, and the United States must bear full responsibility for its aggressive acts.

    我国外交部发表声明
    强烈抗议美在台湾驻导弹部队
    新华社11日讯　中华人民共和国外交部声明
                        1957年5月11日
    1957年5月7日，美国宣布将在中国的领土台湾驻扎装备导弹的美国空军部队。5月8日，美国侵台军事人员宣布，导弹部队的先头部队已经开到台湾。这是美国政府一意推行侵略中国、加剧远东紧张局势的政策中的又一项严重的挑衅行为。中国政府和中国人民对此表示极大的愤慨，并且提出强烈的抗议。
    全世界人民都要求和缓国际紧张局势，在国际关系中实现和平共处的原则。长时期以来，美国侵占台湾，已经造成了台湾地区的紧张局势。中国政府一直主张通过和平谈判和缓和消除台湾地区的紧张局势，并且为此作了多次的努力。台湾是中国的领土，解放台湾是中国的内政。在这一内政问题上，中国政府也一再提出了争取和平解放台湾的号召。
    但是，美国政府却不仅拒绝对台湾地区紧张局势的问题进行认真的谈判，而且还百般加紧它对台湾的控制，蓄意阻挠和破坏中国人自己解决解放台湾的内政问题。美国在台湾驻扎导弹部队的挑衅行为，不仅揭露了美国在世界各地设置导弹以便制造紧张局势的政策的侵略和好战的本质，而且也更加清楚地显示出把台湾完全变为美国属地和原子战争基地的阴谋。
    中国政府庄严地宣告：中国人民解放自己的领土台湾的决心是不可动摇的，美国必须对它的侵略行为担负完全的责任。
