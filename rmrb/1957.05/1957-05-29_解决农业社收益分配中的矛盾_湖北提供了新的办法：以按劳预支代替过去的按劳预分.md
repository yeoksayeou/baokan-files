Solving Contradictions in Income Distribution in Agricultural Cooperatives
Hubei Provides a New Method: Replacing Past Labor-Based Pre-Distribution with Labor-Based Advances

(Our Wuhan Dispatch, May 28th, by our reporter Gu Weijin) With the summer harvest approaching, this reporter asked the responsible person of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China for their opinion on the question of "How to resolve the contradictions in the distribution of cooperatives." He said that a new method has been found to solve the contradictions in the distribution of cooperatives – starting from this summer harvest, labor-based advances will replace the past labor-based pre-distribution.

Labor-Based Pre-Distribution Cannot Adapt to the Number of Harvests
Cadres Are Too Busy and Members Are Still Not Satisfied

Next, this responsible person talked about the past distribution situation: Before the advanced stage of cooperation, there were two harvests each year, summer and autumn. After the advanced stage of cooperation, with the changes in the farming system, there were several harvests a year (harvesting summer crops, early rice, middle rice, late rice, late autumn crops, etc.). Under this new situation, a new distribution method should be adopted. However, last year the old distribution method was still adopted – one pre-distribution for the summer harvest and one pre-distribution for the autumn harvest, which caused some problems: The number of harvests was very frequent, but there were only two pre-distributions. Many specific problems needed to be solved centrally, so it was necessary to estimate production more than a month before the harvest (especially for the autumn harvest pre-distribution, some cooperatives had not even sown their late autumn crops, yet they were estimating production) and formulate pre-distribution plans. As a result, production was estimated too early and was very inaccurate. Pre-distribution plans generally needed to be changed six or seven times, and in some cases, more than ten times. Because the pre-distribution plans changed too much, it took from April to June to formulate the summer harvest pre-distribution plan last year, and from July to December to formulate the autumn harvest pre-distribution plan. After the farming system changed, cadres were particularly busy with production work, but formulating pre-distribution plans took up most of the cadres' time, and many people felt too busy, which affected production work to varying degrees. Because the reported work points could not be realized due to too many changes in the pre-distribution plans, overspending was caused, which aroused the members' doubts about the policy of remuneration according to labor, and they complained that the plans made by the cadres were not effective, calling the plans "reversals of verdicts."

The responsible person of the Provincial Party Committee said that the method of labor-based pre-distribution adopted last year brought many contradictions to the cooperatives. But why was this method adopted? This is related to the development of the work at that time. First of all, last year was the first year of cooperation, and the masses did not understand the policy of remuneration according to labor well enough. Estimating production and formulating pre-distribution plans in advance could enable the masses to understand the policy of remuneration according to labor and actively invest in production. Secondly, cadres lacked experience in distribution at that time.

Cadres Go Deep into the Lower Levels and Consult with the Masses
The Method of Labor-Based Advances Is Very Simple

The responsible person of the Provincial Party Committee said that after studying Chairman Mao's instructions on correctly handling contradictions among the people this year, the Party committees at all levels paid attention to the contradictions that occurred in the distribution last year. They went deep into the grassroots, summed up the experiences and lessons of distribution last year, and listened to the opinions of the masses on this year's distribution. The masses generally put forward a request: This year's distribution should be simple and reasonable. They and the masses studied how to achieve this request, and first analyzed the current situation: Through last year's distribution, the members have already understood the policy of remuneration according to labor; the system of contracting work to groups or individuals has basically become normal; the financial work has been properly cleared and made public; and the harvest volume of each crop accounts for a small proportion of the total crop harvest volume for the year. Based on these conditions, everyone unanimously agreed that if this year's distribution is to be simple and reasonable, the labor-based pre-distribution should be abolished and labor-based advances should be implemented – one advance for each harvest, and settlement at the end of the year. The method of labor-based advances is: convene a meeting of members' representatives to discuss and formulate a labor-based advance plan – because it is an advance in nature, some issues do not need to be as detailed as the pre-distribution. It is only necessary to simply determine a few principles such as estimated production figures, retention and distribution ratios, labor work points participating in the advance, time, and grain ration standards. In this way, the formulation of the advance plan can be shortened from the past seven or eight days to three or four days; the estimated production time is changed from more than a month before the harvest to seven or eight days before the harvest; at the same time, a two-advance method is adopted (the first advance is a part, and the second is settled according to the actual amount received). In this way, the estimated production is more accurate, and the advance plan can be formulated roughly once without rework.

Replacing Labor-Based Pre-Distribution with Labor-Based Advances
Also Requires Several Important Measures

This method is obviously simpler than the previous method of labor-based pre-distribution. However, it can only solve some of the contradictions in distribution. To comprehensively solve the contradictions, it is necessary to make the distribution reasonable, and correctly handle the relationship between the cooperative, the members, and the state, which requires several important measures: 1. Determine the retention and distribution ratio. According to the central instructions, 30%-40% of the cooperative's total annual income will be retained, and the remaining 60%-70% will be distributed to the members, striving to increase the income of about 90% of the members. Under this requirement, various regions appropriately determine the retention and distribution ratio for the summer harvest according to production and needs (among which, production funds, public grain, unified purchase, and public welfare funds must be fully retained); 2. Adhere to the principle of distribution according to labor, more work more gain; 3. While adhering to the principle of distribution according to labor, comprehensively arrange for some members who lack labor and cannot earn enough grain rations; for members who have money to buy grain (such as workers' dependents, cadres' dependents, and members with good household sideline income, etc.), mobilize them to buy grain with their own money; for households with five guarantees and poor households due to natural disasters, provide care from the cooperative's public welfare fund and social relief funds; for poor households with large families and insufficient labor, provide appropriate increase in advance work points, and help reasonably arrange jobs and develop household sideline production, etc.; 4. Clear the accounts and reasonably resolve the contradictions between overspending households and those who should enter; 5. Check the implementation of contracting work to groups or individuals and appropriately resolve existing problems, clear the work point accounts, and reasonably balance the work points between teams; 6. Appropriately resolve policy legacy issues (such as scattered mountain forests and fruit trees, returning them to private individuals, and reasonably adjusting the unfair valuation of plows).

The responsible person said that this method of labor-based advances has been tested in eight representative cooperatives in six counties including Xiaogan, Huangpi, Xishui, Echeng, and Xiangyang, and has been unanimously supported by cadres and the masses.

    解决农业社收益分配中的矛盾
    湖北提供了新的办法：以按劳预支代替过去的按劳预分
    本报武汉28日电　本报记者古维进报道：夏收即将到来，记者以“如何解决合作社分配中的矛盾问题”为题，请中共湖北省委负责人发表意见。他说，解决合作社分配中的矛盾问题，已经找到一个新的办法——从今年夏收开始，以按劳预支代替过去的按劳预分。
    按劳预分不能适应收获次数
    干部忙不过来社员还不满意
    接着，这位负责人谈到过去的分配情形：高级合作化以前，每年夏、秋收获两次，高级合作化以后，随着耕作制度的改变，一年收获数次（收夏收作物、早稻、中稻、晚稻、晚秋等），从夏收以后，平均一个月收获一次。在这个新的情况下，应该采取一种新的分配办法。但是，去年还是采取过去的分配办法——夏收预分一次，秋收预分一次，这就发生了一些问题：收获次数很频繁，预分却只有两次，许多具体问题需要集中解决，不得不在收获以前一个多月进行估产（特别是秋收预分，有些社的晚秋作物还没有下种，就进行估产），制订预分方案。结果估产过早，很不准确，预分方案一般需要变动六、七次，多的达十次以上。由于预分方案变动太多，去年夏收制订预分方案时，从4月搞到6月，秋收制订预分方案时，从7月搞到12月。耕作制度改变以后，干部的生产工作特别繁忙，但制订预分方案却占去干部大半年的时间，许多人都感到忙不过来，使生产工作受到不同程度的影响。由于预分方案变动太多，预报工分不能实现，造成超支，引起社员对按劳取酬政策的怀疑，埋怨干部订的方案不顶事，把方案叫作“翻案”。
    省委负责人说，去年采取按劳预分的办法，给合作社带来许多矛盾。但是，为什么要采取这种办法呢？这和当时工作发展有关系。首先，去年是合作化第一年，群众对于按劳取酬政策不够了解，提前估产制订预分方案，可以使群众了解按劳取酬政策，积极投入生产；其次，当时干部还缺乏分配经验。
    干部深入下层和群众商量
    按劳预支的办法十分简便
    省委负责人说，今年各级党委学习毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的指示后，对于去年分配发生的矛盾问题引起重视。他们深入基层，总结去年分配的经验教训，倾听群众对于今年分配的意见。群众普遍提出一个要求：今年分配，既要简单，又要合理。他们和群众研究怎样实现这个要求，首先分析当前情况：社员经过去年的分配，对于按劳取酬政策已经了解；包工包产基本走上正常状态；财务工作做了适当清理和公开；每次作物收获量占全年作物收获量比例不大。根据这些条件，大家一致认为，今年分配要想做到简单、合理，应该废除按劳预分，实行按劳预支——收获一次，按劳预支一次，年终结账。按劳预支的办法是：召开社员代表大会，讨论制订按劳预支方案——由于是预支性质，所以有些问题不必像预分搞得那样细致，只要简单确定估产数字、扣留和分配比例、参加预支的劳动工分、时间和预支口粮标准等几个原则就成。这样制订预支方案，可以由过去七、八天缩短为三、四天；估产时间则由过去距离收获前一个多月进行改为距离收获前七、八天进行；同时，采取两次预支办法（第一次预支一部分，第二次按实收多少结账）。这样估产比较准确，预支方案大体一次可以制订成，不必返工。
    以按劳预支代替按劳预分
    还需要采取几项重要措施
    这个办法，显然比过去按劳预分的办法简便。但是，它只能解决分配中的部分矛盾问题。要想全面解决矛盾问题，必须做到分配合理，正确地处理社与社员、国家三者的关系，这就需要采取几项重要措施：一、确定扣留和分配比例。根据中央指示，将社的全年总收入扣留30％—40％，其余60％—70％分给社员，争取90％左右社员增加收入。在这个要求下，各地根据生产和需要，适当确定夏收的扣留和分配比例（其中生产资金、公粮、统购、公益金等必须留足）；二、坚持按劳取酬，多劳多得的分配原则；三、在坚持按劳取酬的原则下，全面安排部分缺乏劳力分不回口粮的社员；对有钱买粮的社员（如工属、干属和家庭副业收入较好的社员等），动员他们自己拿钱买粮；对五保户和天灾人祸的困难户，从社的公益金和社会救济款加以照顾；对家大口阔、劳力不足的困难户，给予适当增加预支一段工分，和帮助合理安排活路、开展家庭副业生产等；四、清理账目，合理解决超支户和应进户的矛盾；五、检查包工包产执行情形和适当解决存在的问题，清理工分账目，合理平衡队与队的工分；六、适当解决政策遗留问题（如零星的山林、果木，归还私人，合理调整耕牛折价不公等）。
    负责人说，这个按劳预支的办法，已经在孝感、黄陂、浠水、鄂城、襄阳等六个县的八个有代表性的合作社试验，受到了干部和群众的一致拥护。
