Thatched Houses in the New Industrial Zone

    In the new industrial zone in the northeast suburbs of Chengdu, interspersed among the clusters of tall buildings composed of red bricks and yellow tiles, are some newly built thatched houses. Some of these thatched houses are factory canteens and dormitories, while others are department stores, grain stores, clothing stores, restaurants, photo studios, barber shops, bicycle repair shops, as well as service enterprises such as banks, post and telecommunications offices, and Xinhua bookstores... There is also a "Shahe Cinema" completely built with bamboo and wheat straw.

    Compared with the magnificent modern factories around them, these thatched houses seem a bit out of place. However, people living in the thatched houses told reporters that there are many advantages to building such houses. First, they use local materials, with bamboo and wheat straw replacing scarce building materials such as bricks, tiles, and wood. Second, they are quick to build; a cinema can be built in just thirty days, starting this month and being ready for use next month. Third, they are cheap to build. The thatched houses used for shops cost just over ten yuan per square meter, and the entire investment can be recovered with one year's rent. The cost of the cinema is almost only one-twentieth of the cost of a normal cinema, totaling only more than 8,000 yuan. Because of the small investment and low cost, the tickets for this cinema are also one-third lower than those in the city.

    Although the cost of these thatched houses is low, it does not have a significant impact on their usability. The business hall of the department store is very spacious, capable of receiving more than 300 customers at the same time. The double-eaved roof is fitted with two rows of large glass windows, providing ample light. Customers do not need to turn on the lights even when shopping on cloudy days. The advantage of the thatched roof of the cinema is that it does not conduct heat, keeping it warm in winter and cool in summer, and it does not echo, so the sound effect is clear throughout the venue, whether in the front or back rows. Of course, the appearance of this cinema is not as beautiful as cinemas built with ordinary bricks, tiles, and cement; however, the workers who come to watch movies do not care about these things. They say, "We come to watch movies, not to look at the cinema."

### 新工业区的草房

    新工业区的草房
    在成都东北郊的新工业区里，由一幢幢红砖黄瓦高大楼房所组成的建筑群之间，星罗棋布地夹杂着一些新盖的草房。这些草房有的是工厂的食堂和宿舍，有的是百货商店、粮食店、服装店、菜饭馆、照像馆、理发店、自行车修理店，以及银行、邮电所、新华书店……等类服务性的企业。还有一家“沙河电影院”，也完全是用竹料和麦草盖成的。
    和周围那些宏伟的现代化的厂房对照起来，这类草房似乎有点儿不相称。但是，住在草房里的人对记者说，修建这类草房的好处很多。首先是就地取材，竹料和麦草代替了供应紧张的砖瓦木材等建筑材料。其次是修建快，一座电影院只要三十来天，这个月开工下个月就可以使用。再次是造价廉。商店用的草房每平方公尺不过十元多点，一年的房租就可以收回全部投资。电影院的造价差不多只相当于普通影院造价的二十分之一，总共只花了八千多元。由于投资少，成本低，这座电影院的门票也比城内的电影院要低三分之一。
    这些草房的造价尽管低廉，但对适用并没有太大的影响。百货商店的营业厅很宽敞，可以同时接待三百多个顾客。重檐式的屋顶安了两排宽大的玻璃窗，光线充足。顾客们即使在阴天来选购货物也不用开灯。电影院草屋顶的好处是不传热，冬暖夏凉，又不回声，全场不论前排或后排，声机的音响效果都很清楚。当然，这座电影院的外表是没有一般砖瓦水泥修造的电影院那样漂亮；可是来看电影的工人却不计较这些。他们说：“我们是来看电影的，不是来看电影院。”
