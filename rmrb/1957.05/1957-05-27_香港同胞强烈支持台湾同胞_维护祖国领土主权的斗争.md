Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, May 26th. The Hong Kong "Wen Wei Po" today published the talks of several Hong Kong compatriots in support of Taiwan compatriots.

    Chen Pishi, chairman of the Hong Kong Chinese Innovation Association, said that the anti-American demonstrations by Taiwan compatriots are a struggle to safeguard our country's territorial sovereignty. They will surely receive the strongest support from all patriotic compatriots. I hope that the compatriots in Taiwan will continue their struggle, just like Dr. Sun Yat-sen and our fathers and brothers resisted the imperialist struggle in those years.
    Chen Junbao, a well-known figure in Hong Kong's cultural circles, said that the demonstrations and resistance of Taiwan compatriots under the iron heel of the invaders, on the one hand, showed that the various atrocities of the American invaders in Taiwan have made Taiwan compatriots intolerable; on the other hand, it shows that Taiwan compatriots are increasingly recognizing the ugly face of the American invaders. The force resisting American occupation has become greater and greater. Chen Junbao said that American soldiers killed Chinese people on Chinese territory and got away with it. This is something that every Chinese person feels angry about. This patriotic and anti-aggression struggle of Taiwan compatriots will surely receive the strong support of all Chinese people.
    Huang Jian, standing director of the Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, said that the incident of American soldiers shooting and killing Chinese Liu Ziran shows that the American army is running rampant in Taiwan. The day the US military does not leave Taiwan, the suffering Taiwan compatriots' resentment of the US military will inevitably increase.

    香港同胞强烈支持台湾同胞
    维护祖国领土主权的斗争
    新华社香港26日电　香港“文汇报”今天发表了几位香港同胞声援台湾同胞的谈话。
    香港华人革新协会主席陈丕士说，台湾同胞反美示威是维护我国领土主权的斗争。他们必将受到所有爱国同胞的最强烈支持。我希望在台湾的同胞们继续他们的斗争，就如孙中山先生和我们的父兄当年反抗帝国主义的斗争那样。
    香港文化界知名人士陈君葆说，处在侵略者铁蹄下的台湾同胞的示威反抗，一方面说明了美国侵略者在台湾的种种暴行，已经使台湾同胞忍无可忍；另一方面说明了台湾同胞愈来愈认清了美国侵略者的狰狞面目。反抗美国侵占的力量已愈来愈大。陈君葆说，美国兵在中国领土上杀了中国人而竟然逍遥法外，这是每一个中国人都感到愤恨的事。台湾同胞这种爱国反侵略斗争，必定受到所有中国人民强烈的支持。
    香港中华总商会常务会董黄坚说，美国兵枪杀中国人刘自然事件，说明了美军在台湾横行霸道。美军一天不离开台湾，受罪的台湾同胞对美军的愤恨也必然增加。
