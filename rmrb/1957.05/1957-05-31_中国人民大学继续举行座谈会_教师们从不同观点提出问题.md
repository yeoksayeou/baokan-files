The People's University of China Continues to Hold Symposia
Teachers Raise Questions from Different Perspectives

(Our Newspaper News) Since the beginning of the rectification campaign at the People's University of China, the school's Party committee has invited teachers from across the university to hold many symposia, and teachers have offered many criticisms and suggestions to the school's Party organization.

Yang Chengzuo Says that Leaders at All Levels of the People's University Should Have Clearly Defined Responsibilities

Yang Chengzuo, a professor in the Department of Finance, said: My experience is that to run a school well, we should establish the spirit of the socialist legal system. In everyone's speeches, they talked about the phenomena of our school's large organization, many personnel, low efficiency, and irresponsibility. I think the issue of "having the position and the power" for leaders at all levels of our school is very important (this is not referring to non-Party members but to Party member cadres). The reporting system is very popular in our school, pushing responsibility upwards, which results in having the position but not the power. I taught in old universities for many years, and I think old universities have their merits. In old universities, the scope of responsibilities of the president, provost, and department head were clearly stipulated, and their responsibilities, powers, etc., were all clear. If you couldn't fulfill your responsibilities, you couldn't blame the president (or school president). This is a matter of the legal system. Our school leaders have made mistakes in the manner of a handicraft industry. For example, someone mentioned yesterday that a teacher was ordered by the president to stop teaching. Why wasn't this issue resolved within the department, and instead the president had to intervene? I think the contract system leadership method used in the land reform can still be adopted.

Zhou Zuoren Says that the People's University Needs to Overcome Sectarianism

Zhou Zuoren, a professor in the Department of Finance, said: Teachers who originally worked at the People's University looked down on teachers transferred from other schools, believing that their level of Marxism-Leninism and their professional skills were not as good as those of the teachers at the People's University.

One comrade reported that Shang Yue, the director of the Chinese History Teaching and Research Office, believed that comrades transferred from Shanxi University were all bourgeois scholars. This comrade was very willing to teach, but two or three years have passed, and the school has never allowed him to teach. This is a manifestation of sectarianism. During the restructuring of departments in 1953, some people said that the People's University only wanted students from Shanxi University of Finance and Economics but did not want their teachers. I think this may have been based on convenience, fearing trouble. When a principal reported student grades, he said: The reason for the decline in grades is the result of the merger with the University of Finance and Economics. The situation may be factual, but it is problematic to say it that way. This also reflects sectarianism. If the president has this kind of sentiment, then it is not surprising that those below also have it.

In terms of academics, the leadership attaches importance to the four major theory teaching and research offices, but are the levels of the four theoretical teaching and research offices really that high? I don't think they are higher than the levels of the professional teaching and research offices. I attended night university for four years, and many teachers taught quite well, but I was very dissatisfied with the philosophy class. The content of philosophy is very rich, but the teachers often feel that there is plenty of time but nothing to talk about. Even when connecting to reality, it is often far-fetched.

Ge Peiqi Believes That the Relationship Between the Party and the Masses Today is a World Apart Compared to Before Liberation. Party Members Play the Role of Undercover Police Monitoring the Masses. He said: "Even Without the Leadership of the Communist Party, People Will Not Sell Out Their Country."

Ge Peiqi, a lecturer in the Physical Chemistry Teaching and Research Office of the Department of Industrial Economics, said: I think the relationship between the Party and the masses today is a world apart compared to before liberation. It's like this in schools, and it's like this among the common people. The common people call tofu made from soybean cake "Japanese mixed noodles." The unified purchase and sales system has been messed up, so the supply of goods is tight. The "suppression of counter-revolutionaries" movement has been messed up. The Party has made mistakes, and leaders should voluntarily request punishment. Pork is in short supply, and the common people can't afford it. Some people say that this is because the standard of living has improved. Who are the people whose standard of living has improved? It's the Party members and cadres who used to wear torn shoes but now ride in small cars and wear woolen uniforms. To be honest, the reason why the supply of goods is tight is because those who implement the Party's policies have made mistakes. For example, where did the pork go? It wasn't eaten up by the common people, but rather because deviations occurred in the implementation of the unified purchase and sales policy of grain, and the common people were unwilling to raise pigs.

When the Communist Party entered the city in 1949, the common people welcomed them with "baskets of food and pots of drink" like "welcoming the royal army." Today, the common people treat the Communist Party with "respecting ghosts and gods and keeping them at a distance." The common people have always been like this. There are many such examples in Chinese history. When the rulers have not yet obtained ruling power, the common people always welcome them, but once they obtain ruling power and disregard the interests of the people, the people will oppose them. For example, in 1945, when the Anti-Japanese War was won, the common people, who had been oppressed by the Japanese for eight years, also welcomed the Kuomintang. Later, the Kuomintang officials engaged in the "five sons ascending to the throne," and the people opposed them. The situation is different now. The common people have a lot of opinions about the Communist Party. If the Communist Party is not aware, it is also very dangerous.

In the past, when doing underground work in school, we used a set of methods such as contacting progressives and winning over neutrals, but today we use Party members to lead. So, judging the achievements of Party members is based on how many reports they make. The more reports they make, the better the Party member. Party members play the role of undercover police monitoring the masses. This cannot be blamed on the Party members because the Party organization asks them to gather intelligence, so the responsibility lies with the Party organization, as this is the task given by the organization.

The Communist Party is half-hearted towards me, and I am also half-hearted towards you. China is China of 600 million people, including counter-revolutionaries, not the China of the Communist Party. It is good for Party members to have a sense of ownership, but you cannot think that "I am the state," which is not allowed. You should not exclude others just because you are the owner, and you cannot only think that Party members are reliable while others are suspicious, especially for non-Party members who like to complain. The Communist Party can take a look, don't be arrogant, and don't distrust us intellectuals. If you do well, that's fine; if you don't do well, the masses can overthrow you, kill the Communists, and overthrow you. You can't say that they don't love the country, because the Communists don't serve the people. If the Communist Party falls, China will not fall. Because even without the leadership of the Communist Party, people will not sell out their country.

Pang Jingren Says, I Think to Run a University Well, We Should First Let Professors Teach More Classes

Pang Jingren, a professor in the Department of Journalism, said: I think the People's University has shortcomings and also has achievements. Dogmatism is an important shortcoming. But since liberation, the People's University has trained a large number of cadres when there was a shortage of talent, which is a great achievement. But today, as the highest institution of learning, the People's University must have academic standards. If it doesn't have sufficient academic standards, it is a university that is not worthy of the name. Our leaders have not fully paid attention to this in the past. Our school leaders want to run a socialist university, but their style is that of a handicraft industry. They don't see far enough, they don't see comprehensively enough, and they don't look at it from an academic perspective. I think to run a university well, we should first let professors teach more classes. Our Marxism-Leninism night university should also let professors teach a little. If only young teachers are there reciting dogmas, often repeating a sentence two or three times, won't people get tired of listening?

Our school leaders should quickly push non-Party professors to transform towards becoming red professors. We are willing to quickly and completely transform into red professors, and we especially ask for a force that can transform us.

Qu Xuewen Says That the Cadres Trained by the People's University Have Done a Lot of Work

Qu Xuewen, a faculty member in the Department of Journalism, said: The school's implementation of the spirit of rectification while correcting shortcomings is poor. Why is everyone not confident? That's the reason. If it can't be changed, it should be explained clearly. The leadership should have a bold and decisive spirit.

I disagree with Professor Xu Mengxiong's speech at the senior group meeting. He believes that the People's University is a big nest of dogmatism. The cadres trained by the People's University have done a lot of work, and this is a blow to them. Dogmatism is serious and should be changed, but that kind of statement is not right. If the People's University is a big nest of dogmatism, it should be closed down, and the students should protest.

### 中国人民大学继续举行座谈会  教师们从不同观点提出问题

    中国人民大学继续举行座谈会
    教师们从不同观点提出问题
    本报讯　中国人民大学开始整风以来，学校党委已经邀请全校教师分别举行了许多次座谈会，教师们给学校党组织提出许多批评和意见。
    杨承祚说，人民大学各级领导应职责分明
    财政系教授杨承祚说：我的体会是：要办好学校，应树立社会主义法制精神。大家发言中谈到我校机构庞大，人员多，效率低，不负责等现象。我认为我校各层领导“有职有权”问题很重要（这不是指党外人士而是指党员干部），我校很流行汇报制度，把责任往上推，结果就形成有职无权了。我在旧大学教过多年书，我觉得旧大学有可取之处，旧大学中，院长、教务长、系主任的职责范围都有明文规定，职责、权限等都清清楚楚，你的责任尽不到，不能埋怨院（校）长，这就是法制的问题。我校领导上多少犯了手工业方式的错误，如：昨天发言中有人谈到，一位教员被校长命令停课了，这个问题为什么不在系里解决，而要校长来过问呢？我认为土改中的包干制领导方式，还是可以采纳的。
    周作仁说，人民大学要克服宗派主义
    财政系教授周作仁说：原来的人民大学教师看不起从别的学校里调来的教师，认为他们马列主义水平和业务水平都不如人民大学的教师。
    有一个同志反映，中国历史教研室主任尚钺同志，认为从山西大学转来的同志都是资产阶级学者。这个同志很愿意教课，但两三年过去了，学校一直不让他讲课，这是宗派主义表现。1953年院系调整时，有人说人民大学只要山西财经学院的学生，但是不要他们的教员。我想这可能是从办事出发，怕麻烦。有一个校长报告学生成绩时说：成绩所以下降是由于财经学院合并来的结果。情况可能是事实，但这样讲是有问题的。这也反映了宗派主义情绪。校长要有这种情绪，那么下边也有是不足为奇的。
    领导上在学术方面重视四大理论教研室，但是否四门理论教研室的水平很高呢？我觉得并不比业务教研室水平高。我在夜大学听了四年课，很多教师讲得倒不坏，但是我对哲学课很不满意。哲学的内容本来是很丰富的，但是，教员常常感到时间多，没东西可讲。即使联系实际，往往也是牵强附会。
    葛佩琦认为：今天党群关系与解放前相比，差了十万八千里。党员起了监视群众的便衣警察的作用。他说：“不要共产党领导，人家也不会卖国”。
    工业经济系物理化学教研室讲师葛佩琦说：我认为今天党群关系与解放前相比，差了十万八千里。学校是这样，老百姓也是这样，老百姓把豆饼做的豆腐叫做日本的混合面。统购统销搞糟了，所以物资供应紧张，“肃反”运动搞糟了，党犯了错误，领导人应该自请处分。猪肉紧张，老百姓吃不上，有人说这是生活水平提高；生活水平提高的是哪些人呢？过去穿破鞋，现在坐小卧车穿呢子制服的党员和干部。说良心话，物资供应之所以紧张，这是由于执行党的政策的人犯了错误，例如，猪肉哪里去了呢？不是被老百姓吃光了，而是因为执行粮食统购统销政策发生了偏差，老百姓不肯养猪所造成的。
    1949年共产党进城时，老百姓都是“箪食壶浆”“以迎王师”来欢迎。今天老百姓对共产党是“敬鬼神而远之”。老百姓几时也是这样，中国历史上好多这样的例子，当统治者没得到统治地位的时候，老百姓总是欢迎他们的，但他们一旦得到了统治地位，而不顾人民利益时，人民就要反对他们。例如，1945年抗战胜利时，受了日本人压迫了八年的老百姓也欢迎过国民党，后来国民党的大员搞“五子登科”，人民就反对他们。现在的情况不同了，老百姓对共产党的意见很多了。共产党若不自觉也是很危险的。
    过去在学校做地下工作时，是用联系进步、争取中立等一套方式，而今天是用党员来领导，所以看党员的成绩就是看汇报多少，汇报的多，就是好党员，党员起了监视群众的便衣警察的作用。这事不能怪党员，因为党组织叫他们作情报，所以责任在党组织，因这是组织给的任务。
    共产党对我三心二意，我对你也三心二意。中国是六亿人民的中国，包括反革命在内，不是共产党的中国。党员有主人翁的态度是好的，但是，你们认为“朕即国家”是不容许的。你们不应因自己是主人翁而排斥别人，不能只有党员是可靠的，而别人都是可疑的，特别是对爱发牢骚的党外人士，共产党可以看看，不要自高自大，不要不相信我们知识分子。搞得好，可以；不好，群众可以打倒你们，杀共产党人，推翻你们，这不能说不爱国，因为共产党人不为人民服务。共产党亡了，中国不会亡。因为，不要共产党领导，人家也不会卖国。
    庞景仁说，我认为办好大学，首先应让教授多上课
    新闻系教授庞景仁说：我认为人民大学有缺点也有成绩，教条主义就是一个重要缺点。但是解放以来，人民大学在青黄不接时培养出大批的干部，这是很大的成绩。可是到今天，人民大学作为最高学府来说，就要有学术水平，不够学术水平，就是名不副实的大学。我们的领导，过去没有充分注意这一点。我们学校的领导，心里想办社会主义的大学，但是作风是手工业式的。看得不够远，不够全面，没有从学术方面来看。我认为办好大学，首先应该让教授多上课。我们的马列主义夜大学，也应该让教授来教一教，光是年轻的教师在那里背教条，一句话往往念两三遍，叫人听得腻不腻？
    我们学校的领导，应当赶快推动一下党外的教授往红色的教授方面变。我们愿意很快完全变为红色的教授，特别要求给我们一种变的力量。
    曲学文说，人民大学培养出来的干部做了很多工作
    新闻系教员曲学文说：学校贯彻边整边改的精神差，大家为什么信心不高？就是这个原因。不能改要讲清道理，领导上应有大刀阔斧的精神。
    我不同意许孟雄教授在高级组会上的发言。他认为人大是教条主义大蜂窝。人民大学培养出来的干部作了很多工作，这样对他们是个打击。教条主义是严重的，应该改，但那种说法不对。如果人大是大蜂窝应该关门，学生要提出抗议。
