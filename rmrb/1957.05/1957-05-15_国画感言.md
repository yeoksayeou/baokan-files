    Reflections on Traditional Chinese Painting	Wang Shensheng
    Since liberation, our Party and Chairman Mao have shown meticulous care for traditional Chinese painters. We can only express our heartfelt gratitude and repay them with practical actions.
    I am in my sixties this year. In the long dark years of the past, I diligently studied the national style of flower-and-bird painting. I believe I spent half my life's time and energy, and I watched as the traditional art of Chinese painting grew cold, with no chance of resurgence or hope. I felt extremely uneasy.
    Unexpectedly, in the seven years since liberation, our great motherland has seen a brand-new look. All aspects are developing rapidly, advancing by leaps and bounds. Our international standing is rising day by day, and the lives of people across the country are becoming increasingly prosperous. Everyone is contributing their wisdom and strength to move towards socialism.
    Last year, after the Party Central Committee put forward the wise call for "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," the world of traditional Chinese painting became even more active. The long-awaited Beijing Chinese Painting Academy has opened today. This makes us, the traditional Chinese painting workers, ecstatic, so happy that we cannot speak. Everyone is greatly encouraged!
    I think that traditional Chinese painting has received such strong support and care from the government, so that the excellent traditional national painting heritage can be inherited and promoted. Our purpose is to introduce the creative experiences and insights of older painters to young people, and to consciously and unreservedly impart all our knowledge of traditional Chinese painting to the next generation, so that traditional Chinese painting can be carried forward and developed! This is achievable and we can be confident of it. At the same time, we must unite and overcome difficulties, enrich our knowledge, and unleash our individual potential and collective wisdom to advance towards science. We must deeply study Marxism-Leninism, the literary and artistic policies indicated by Mao Zedong, and the advanced theories of the Soviet Union.
    Of course, traditional Chinese painting is not without its shortcomings, which need to be gradually improved. Comrade Zhou Yang said at a meeting of the Artists Association: "But do not rush to integrate Chinese and Western painting methods in terms of expressive techniques, and do not arbitrarily change what has been formed over thousands of years. Avoid losing the excellent parts of the tradition through a rash attitude. The real reform of traditional Chinese painting must develop on the basis of the original tradition and must be achieved through the artistic practice of Chinese painters themselves. Only in this way can we create new Chinese paintings with Chinese style and Chinese characteristics."
    We have a clear understanding of the direction of traditional Chinese painting. We will take advantage of these remaining years to consciously and wholeheartedly serve the cause of traditional Chinese painting; to serve the people and socialism with our art!
    Finally, I firmly believe that under the correct leadership of the government and with the supervision and assistance of all parties, the Beijing Chinese Painting Academy will certainly be well-run and will cultivate a large number of outstanding young traditional Chinese painters.

    国画感言	汪慎生
    自从解放以来，我们党和毛主席关心国画家真是无微不至的。我们只有衷心的感激并以实际的表现来答谢。
    我今年六十多岁了，过去生活在漫长的黑夜里，是一直刻苦钻研民族形式的花鸟画，我认为自己用了半生的时光和精力，眼看国画传统艺术冰冷下去，没有翻身的日子和希望，真感到万分不安。
    想不到解放后七年多的时光，我们伟大的祖国出现了崭新的面貌，各方面都是一日千里的不断的飞速发展。在国际上的地位一天比一天提高，而且全国人民的生活日益富裕，大家都为走向社会主义而贡献自己的智慧和力量。
    去年党中央提出了“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的英明号召之后，国画界也更活跃，酝酿已久的北京中国画院，今天开幕了。使我们国画工作者，兴奋欲狂，高兴得说不出话来，每个人都倍加欢欣鼓舞！
    我想国画得到政府这样大力的支持和爱护，要使优良传统的民族绘画遗产继承发扬。我们的目的是把老画家们创作的经验与心得介绍给青年人，要自觉的毫无保留的尽量将所有国画知识传授给下一代，从而使国画发扬光大！这是可以做得到，可以自信的。同时，我们要团结一致克服困难，我们要丰富自己的知识，发挥个人潜在的力量和集体的智慧向科学进军，要深入学习马列主义、毛泽东所指示的文艺方针，和苏联先进的理论。
    当然，国画不是没有缺点，这需要逐步的改进。周扬同志在美协的一次会议上说：“但是不要急于在表现方法上溶合中西画法，不要把几千年所形成的东西随意改变，避免传统的优良部分在轻率态度下丧失。国画的真正改革必须在传统原有基础上发展，必须通过国画家本身的艺术实践。只有这样，才能创作出具有中国气派和中国作风的新国画。”
    我们对国画的方向有了明确的认识，我们趁这余年自觉的全心全意的为国画事业服务；以我们的艺术为人民服务，为社会主义服务！
    最后我深信：北京国画院在政府的正确领导下，在各方面的督促与帮助下，一定能够办好，并培养出大量的优秀的青年国画家。
