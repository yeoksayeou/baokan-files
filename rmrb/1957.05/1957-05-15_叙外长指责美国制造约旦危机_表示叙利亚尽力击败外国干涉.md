Xinhua News Agency, May 14th, Paris dispatch: Syrian Foreign Minister Bitar, in an interview with a reporter from the weekly "Le Nouvel Observateur," pointed out that the Jordan incident was a "reflection of the United States' interference in Arab affairs and exertion of pressure."

Bitar's interview was published in the May 3rd issue of the weekly. He said that from the pronouncements of American leaders, and from the threatening actions of its fleet, it has been proven that this crisis was indeed man-made.

He said that at the time, there was no real internal conflict between the King of Jordan and the previous government, because that government accommodated representatives of various parties, and its purely national program did not touch the interests of the royal family and reactionaries in the slightest. That government pursued a policy of active neutrality supported by the Arab people, which merely expressed the principles of national liberation.

Bitar said: "However, this attitude made the United States very unhappy. It used the so-called communist danger as a cover, supported the most reactionary factions such as the Muslim Brotherhood and the Bedouin tribes, and did its utmost to strike at progressive movements, frustrate the neutral policy, and establish a pro-American regime, thereby undermining Jordan's independence and freedom."

Bitar said that before Eisenhower announced his plan, people in the Middle East had thought that American policy was essentially different from British policy. Later, people thought that the two policies differed only in method. However, when the United States decided to take action, people discovered that there was no difference even in method, "that is to say, supporting internal reactionary tendencies and creating divisions among Arab countries."

Bitar said: "Syria believes that the Jordan incident is a direct reflection of what people hope will happen within Syria. Syria even believes that foreign interference is primarily aimed at Syria. Therefore, Syria is closely watching the development of the situation and doing its utmost to defeat this conspiracy."

Bitar said that the danger of American policy lies in its attempt to force people to choose between the East and the West. Today, the struggle between Arab countries and imperialism is precisely on this issue. He said that if the United States does not change its attitude, the result will be to exacerbate tensions in the Middle East, and make Arab countries even more hostile to Western policies. At that time, it will be impossible to create conditions for lasting peace in the region.

### 叙外长指责美国制造约旦危机  表示叙利亚尽力击败外国干涉

    叙外长指责美国制造约旦危机
    表示叙利亚尽力击败外国干涉
    新华社14日讯　巴黎消息：叙利亚外交部长比塔尔在对“法兰西观察家”周刊记者发表谈话时指出，约旦事件是美国“干涉阿拉伯事务和施加压力的反映”。
    比塔尔的谈话刊载在这家周刊5月3日出版的一期上。他说，从美国领袖的言论中，从它的舰队的威胁性的行动中，已经证明这个危机确实是人工制造的。
    他说，当时在约旦国王和前届政府之间并没有真正的内部冲突，因为那个政府容纳了各个政党的代表，它的纯粹民族性质的纲领丝毫不触及王室的利益和反动人士的利益。那个政府奉行阿拉伯人民所支持的积极中立政策，只不过是表达了民族解放的原则。
    比塔尔说：“然而，这种态度使得美国很不高兴，就用所谓共产主义危险作为掩盖，支持着穆斯林兄弟会和贝都印部落之类最反动的派系，竭力打击进步运动，挫折中立政策，建立亲美政权，从而损害约旦的独立和自由。”
    比塔尔说，在艾森豪威尔没有公布他的计划的时候，中东的人们本来还以为美国的政策在本质上不同于英国的政策。后来，人们以为，这两种政策只在方法上有所区别。然而等到美国决定进入行动的时候，人们就发现了就连方法上也丝毫没有区别，“那就是说，支持内部反动倾向和制造阿拉伯国家之间的分化”。
    比塔尔说：“叙利亚认为，约旦事件就是人们希望叙利亚境内也发生的事件的直接反映，叙利亚甚至认为，外国干涉首先针对的就是叙利亚，因此，叙利亚密切地注视着事态的发展，并且竭尽努力来击败这一阴谋。”
    比塔尔说，美国政策的危险，就在于它要强迫人在东方和西方之间进行抉择。今天，阿拉伯各国和帝国主义之间正是在这个问题上进行斗争的。他说，假如美国不改变态度，结果就会使中东紧张局势加剧，而阿拉伯各国更加敌视西方政策。那时，将不可能为这个地区的持久和平创造条件。
