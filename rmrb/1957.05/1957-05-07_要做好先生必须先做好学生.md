To Be a Good Teacher, One Must First Be a Good Student
Li Ou, Associate Professor of Tsinghua University
The author discusses the issue of university teachers interacting with workers and peasants and engaging in self-education.

    Chairman Mao's recent two speeches have once again clarified the direction and tasks for intellectuals. My understanding is: intellectuals are required to be humble primary school students who learn from the workers and peasants, to continue cultivating working-class sentiments, to have more common language with workers and peasants, and to thoroughly transform the non-working-class thinking of intellectuals. At the same time, intellectuals are also required to be diligent and conscientious good teachers of the people, educating the people and propagating Marxism to the people through their work in literature, education, science, and art.
    Facts have proven that intellectuals benefit the most from direct contact with workers and peasants. In the past, many intellectuals who participated in land reform unanimously believed that it was their first vivid lesson in ideological transformation. A few days ago, several newly returned professors visited Anshan Iron and Steel in Northeast China and other places. After seeing the selfless labor of the workers, they also talked about how it enhanced their ideological motivation. Therefore, in the future, it is very necessary to organize intellectuals to go to the countryside and factories according to the situation, and some to settle down in rural areas and factories for a period.
    However, university teachers have certain teaching and scientific research tasks, so it is impossible to send them to the countryside and factories in large numbers for a long time. I believe that to improve the ideological level of teachers, we must make full use of the existing environment and combine it with regular work.
    Taking teachers in higher industrial schools as an example, they can use production internships and scientific research work to have more contact with workers and learn from workers. Every year, teachers in higher industrial schools have two or three months to lead students to factories and mines for internships. In the past, many professors and lecturers returned from internships with improved ideological awareness. Many comrades are proud of sharing hardships with workers. However, according to my understanding, some comrades do not take the initiative to approach workers, or the time is too short to have in-depth conversations with workers. In this regard, I suggest that teachers take the initiative to approach workers during production internships. In addition, give teachers a week or two to visit and delve into the lives of workers. It is also suggested that the scope of participation in production internships be expanded, and some basic course teachers and political course teachers should be included according to conditions. Some scientific research topics in higher industrial schools are in cooperation with factories and mines. If conditions permit, these research tasks can also be carried out in factories and mines, discussing more with workers, and becoming familiar and close to workers, so that they can exchange feelings and consolidate the view of intellectuals serving workers and peasants.
    University teachers who want to be teachers of the people must first comprehensively care for and educate the students in school. In the past, some teachers only believed that their responsibility was to guide students' professional learning, and regarded the ideological education of students as the responsibility of the Party, the Youth League, and political course teachers. This understanding is not comprehensive enough; it should also be the common responsibility of all teachers, because teachers influence students to a large extent. Especially at present, there are some incorrect understandings among some students. For example, some students are willing to be experts but do not care about politics; they overemphasize theory and despise production practice, etc. Teachers should influence students in these aspects by "setting an example." Tsinghua University Vice President Liu Xianzhou and Professor Zhang Guangdou had discussions with some students in light of some problems existing among the students, which was of great help to the students. More importantly, teachers have also improved themselves from the work of educating students.
    In universities, teachers can also be teachers to each other. They can receive mutual education through collective activities. For example, it is still necessary for teachers to appropriately participate in some social work inside and outside the school. At present, some teachers have incorrect views on participating in social work. Especially after the slogan of marching toward science was put forward, they one-sidedly understood the spirit of this slogan and did not pay enough attention to overall work. They believe that doing social work is not promising and wastes time. In fact, in today's era of great social change, all classes have different reflections on this change. By doing some social work, studying, analyzing, and solving certain ideological problems, one not only educates others but also educates oneself. Of course, teaching or scientific research work should not be seriously affected by doing social work.
    In my opinion, the ideological transformation of intellectuals should be more proactive and accelerated in the future. Intellectuals should not only invest in the current construction upsurge, but also be very vigilant not to return to the old path of intellectuals "not hearing anything outside the window, only focusing on reading the books of sages." To be a good teacher of the people, one must first be a good student of the people, that is, one must face the workers and peasants and face reality more. The spring blossom season for intellectuals is largely nurtured by their own humility and enthusiasm.

### 要做好先生必须先做好学生

    要做好先生必须先做好学生
    清华大学副教授　李欧
    作者在这里谈到了高等学校教师接触工农和自我教育的问题
    毛主席最近的两次讲话，对知识分子，再一次明确了方向和任务。我的体会是：要求知识分子做一个虚心向工农群众学习的小学生，要继续培养工人阶级感情，要和工农有更多的共同语言，彻底改造知识分子的非工人阶级思想。同时又要求知识分子，做一个人民的勤勤恳恳的好先生，通过所从事的文学、教育、科学、艺术等工作来教育人民，向人民宣传马克思主义。
    事实证明，知识分子和工农直接接触，得益最多。过去有不少参加过土地改革的知识分子，都不约而同的认为那是自己思想改造的第一堂生动的大课。前些日子，几位新回国的教授参观东北鞍钢等地，看到工人的忘我劳动以后，也谈到它增强了自己的思想动力。因此今后根据情况，组织知识分子下乡下厂，有些到农村工厂安家立户一个时期都是很有必要的。
    但是高等学校的教师有一定的教学和科学研究任务，因此不可能大批的长期的下乡下厂。我认为提高教师的思想水平，就要尽量利用现有环境，结合经常工作来进行。
    以高等工业学校的教师为例，就可以利用生产实习和科学研究工作，多和工人接触，向工人学习。每年高等工业学校教师，都有两三个月的时间，领导学生到厂矿进行实习。过去有许多教授、讲师实习回来，思想觉悟有所提高。许多同志都以和工人共甘苦为荣。但是据我了解，也有的同志不主动和工人接近，或时间匆促，不可能和工人深谈。在这方面，我建议生产实习中教师要主动接近工人，另外给教师一两个星期时间参观和深入工人生活，并且建议将参加生产实习的范围扩大，根据条件吸收一些基础课教师及政治课教师参加。高等工业学校有些科学研究题目是和厂矿合作的。这些研究工作，如果有条件，也可以拿到厂矿去作，和工人多商量，和工人熟悉亲密起来，彼此就可以交流感情，巩固知识分子为工农服务的观点。
    高等学校的教师要做人民的先生，首先要全面关心和教育在校的学生。过去有些教师只认为自己的职责是指导学生的业务学习，而将对学生的思想教育工作理解为是党、团组织和政治课教师的事。这样了解，是不够全面的；它也应该是全体教师的共同责任，因为教师在很大程度上影响着学生。尤其是目前，在部分学生中有一些不正确的认识。譬如有些学生愿意做专家但不关心政治；过分强调理论而轻视生产实践等。教师在这些方面就要“以身作则”的来影响学生。清华大学刘仙洲副校长和张光斗教授，结合学生中存在的一些问题，和部分学生进行过座谈，对学生帮助就很大。更重要的是教师从教育学生工作中，也提高了自己。
    在高等学校里，教师之间，还可以互为先生。通过集体活动，互受教育。譬如教师适当的参加一些校内校外的社会工作仍是必要的。目前有些教师对参加社会工作有不正确的看法。尤其是向科学进军口号提出来以后，片面理解这口号的精神，对全面工作关心不够。认为做社会工作没有出息，浪费时间，其实在今天社会大变动时期，各个阶级对待这一变动都有不同的反映，而通过作一些社会工作，研究分析并解决某些思想问题，不但教育了别人，而且教育了自己。当然，也不能因为做社会工作而严重影响教学或科学研究工作。
    依我看来，今后知识分子思想改造工作，更要主动，加紧。知识分子不但要投入目前建设的高潮中，同时也要十分警惕不要回到以前知识分子“两耳不闻窗外事，一心只读圣贤书”的老路上去。要做人民的好先生，必须先做人民的好学生，也就必须多面向工农群众，面向实际。知识分子的春暖花开时节，很大程度上是靠自己的虚心热情所孕育出来的。
