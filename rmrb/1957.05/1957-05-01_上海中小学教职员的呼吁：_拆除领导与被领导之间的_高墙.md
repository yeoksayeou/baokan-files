Appeals from Shanghai Primary and Secondary School Teachers and Staff:
Dismantle the "High Wall" Between Leaders and the Led

    (Our dispatch) Shanghai – “Let us primary and secondary school teachers and staff also speak! We need such a meeting too much.” Liu Fei, a teacher at the Shanghai Second Normal School, said in an exceptionally excited tone at the symposium convened by the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee on April 26, attended by figures from primary and secondary schools and the sports sector. Chairman Mao's speech deeply moved the hearts of Shanghai's primary and secondary school teachers and staff. Liu Fei said that yesterday evening, many teachers came to me, asking me to bring their opinions to this meeting. Everyone wants to "放" (let go) and "鸣" (speak out), everyone wants to pour out their hearts. The schools have not yet discussed this speech, and some people are afraid that Chairman Mao's words will not be implemented at the grassroots level, so we ask the Municipal Party Committee for support. Comrade Ke Qingshi immediately replied to him: "The Municipal Party Committee supports you, be bold and 放 (let go)!"

    Nearly twenty primary and secondary school principals and teachers attended this symposium with great enthusiasm. Those who spoke pointed out that in primary and secondary schools, there is still a high wall separating leaders and the led. Some school principals never speak a single word individually to teachers, except to lecture them at large meetings. Some teachers said painfully, "If I could just say a few words to the principal, my problem could be solved, but I don't have the opportunity." The distance between Party members and the masses is also very far. Liu Fei said: "Some Party members were classmates a year ago, and they were very close to the teachers then. A year later, after taking on leadership positions, they put on airs of being Party members and ignored people." In the relationship between Party member principals and non-Party member principals, Party member principals often do not appear humble enough, and some are even overbearing, taking a crude attitude toward teachers. Jiang Xiangqing, Vice Principal of Shanghai Sports School, believes that this is the situation in their school.

    The Shanghai Education Bureau's past high-and-mighty bureaucratic work style has been criticized by many people. Many teachers are afraid to go to the Education Bureau, especially to the Personnel Office. The Personnel Office either lectures or transfers staff, so some people say, "Hearing the Personnel Office call, one can't help but feel alarmed and frightened." Yu Ruonan, a teacher at Jiannan Middle School, said angrily: "In recent years, not to mention that the Director or Division Chiefs of the Education Bureau have never met with us once, even the staff members rarely deal with us." Precisely because the Education Bureau has long been out of touch with the masses, it tends to listen to only one side, often only learning about the situation in schools from a few school leaders, which cannot but be one-sided. Everyone demands that this situation be changed quickly.

    Some people refuted the erroneous notion that primary and secondary school teachers are not qualified to participate in "百家争鸣" (the Hundred Schools of Thought Contend) because of their low level. Xu Fu, Principal of Shanghai Girls' High School, believes that middle school teachers are intellectuals, they need to speak out (鸣), and they can speak out (鸣). For example, there are many problems worth discussing regarding middle school textbooks, from quality to quantity, which requires contention (争鸣).

    The sports figures who attended the meeting also spoke enthusiastically. Their speeches focused on pointing out that the ideas of championship-ism and individual heroism have developed among sports personnel, which is inseparable from the leadership style of the sports work leadership, which emphasizes technology, seeks quick success and great achievements, and neglects ideological work.

### 上海中小学教职员的呼吁：  拆除领导与被领导之间的“高墙”

    上海中小学教职员的呼吁：
    拆除领导与被领导之间的“高墙”
    本报讯  “让我们中小学教职员也来讲讲吧！我们太需要这样的会议了。”上海第二师范学校教员刘非在4月26日上海市委召集的中小学和体育界人士座谈会上，用异常激动的语调这样说。毛主席的讲话深深地激动了上海中小学教职员的心。刘非说，昨天晚上，有许多教员来找我，要我把意见带到这个会上来，大家要放，要鸣，大家要把心中的话都掏出来。现在学校中还没有讨论这个讲话，有些人怕毛主席的话贯彻不到基层去，因此我们要求市委支持。柯庆施同志立即回答他：“市委支持你们，你们大胆地放吧！”
    近二十位的中小学校长和教职员怀着热烈的心情参加了这次座谈会。发言的人都指出，在中小学中，领导和被领导之间还隔着一道高墙。有的学校的校长除了在大会上向教职员训话外，从来没有和教职员个别说一句话。有些教员痛苦地说，“只要和校长说几句话，就能解决我的问题，可是我没有机会。”党员和群众距离也很远。刘非说：“有些党员一年前还是同学，那时他们对老师很亲近，一年后担任了领导工作，就摆出党员架子不理人了。”在党员校长和非党员校长共事关系中，党员校长往往表示不够虚心，有的甚至盛气凌人，对教员采取粗暴的态度。上海体育学校副校长蒋湘青认为他们学校中就是这种情形。
    市教育局过去高高在上的官僚主义作风受到了不少人的批评。许多教员都怕到教育局去，特别怕到教育局人事室去。人事室找职员不是训话就是调职，因此有人说“听得人事室一声唤，不由人心惊胆怕”。建南中学教员余若南气愤地说：“这几年来，不要说教育局局长、处长没有和我们见过一次面，就是科员和我们打交道的也不多。”正因为教育局长期不接近群众，因此偏听偏信，往往只从学校少数负责人那里来了解学校的情况，不能不是片面的。大家要求迅速改变这种情况。
    有人发言中驳斥那种认为中小学教员水平低不能参加“百家争鸣”的错误说法。上海女中校长徐甫认为中学教员是知识分子，他们需要鸣，也可以鸣。譬如说，中学教材从质量到数量就有许多问题值得讨论，这就需要争鸣。
    到会的体育界人士发言也很踊跃。发言中着重指出目前体育人员中锦标主义和个人英雄主义思想有了发展，这是和体育工作领导上重技术、好大喜功、看轻思想工作的领导作风分不开的。
