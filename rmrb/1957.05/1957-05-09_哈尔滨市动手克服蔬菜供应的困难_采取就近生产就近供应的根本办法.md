Harbin Takes Action to Overcome Difficulties in Vegetable Supply
    Adopts the Fundamental Method of Local Production and Local Supply

    (Our Dispatch) "Local production, local supply" is the fundamental solution to urban vegetable supply. The historical situation of vegetable supply in Harbin and the experience of veteran farmers prove that this method is feasible even in northern regions with cold climates and short growing seasons.

    In the past, Harbin could produce thirty to forty kinds of vegetables in summer and autumn. After the autumn harvest, vegetables could be stored until late spring of the following year, when new vegetables would come on the market. Therefore, there was no shortage of vegetable supply in the past. However, in recent years, with the development of urban construction, the shortage of vegetable supply has become increasingly serious. The city's population was 1.05 million in 1953 and increased to 1.45 million in 1956. During this period, although the planting area and total output of vegetables in the suburbs increased somewhat, they were not keeping pace with the growth of the population and the improvement of people's living standards. In particular, the planting area of autumn vegetables for consumption in winter and spring has not only not increased, but has decreased a lot. The area planted with Chinese cabbage and radish alone decreased from 7,100 hectares in 1954 to 4,500 hectares in 1956. Therefore, it was necessary to transfer large quantities of vegetables from remote areas in winter and spring. Last year, vegetables transferred from other places accounted for 28% of the city's total annual supply, costing 1.65 million yuan, accounting for more than 80% of the local vegetable company's total expenditure. As a result, the company lost more than 300,000 yuan, accounting for more than half of its total funds. However, the vegetable supply situation did not ease, and prices rose sharply, seriously affecting the lives of citizens.

    There are many reasons for the tight vegetable supply situation in Harbin, such as the excessive and rapid growth of the urban population, the expansion of capital construction in the suburbs, and the excessive occupation of vegetable land. However, the main reason is the lack of a clear policy for operating vegetables. The city's vegetable supply mainly relies on transfers from other places, rather than actively guiding and supporting local production. Some measures even affected local production, such as setting seasonal price differences too small, or even the same price throughout the year. As a result, farmers and consumers no longer store vegetables. Vegetables are concentrated on the market during the harvest season, causing "cheap vegetables hurting farmers," which dampened the enthusiasm of agricultural cooperatives and farmers to grow vegetables.

    In order to completely improve the vegetable supply situation, the Harbin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Municipal People's Committee recently decided to put vegetable production in the primary position of suburban production, requiring that common vegetables be self-sufficient this year, and strive to be self-sufficient in fine vegetables such as cucumbers and tomatoes in winter and spring in about three years. Based on the citizens' vegetable consumption level and adding a safety factor of 40%-50% for disaster prevention, this year's vegetable planting area has been expanded to 26,000 hectares, an increase of more than 4,000 hectares compared with 1956. Since vegetables cannot grow for at least six months each year, agricultural cooperatives, farmers, and collective catering units and citizens with conditions are also prepared to store winter vegetables as much as possible. Including the storage of the vegetable company, it is preliminarily planned that during the half year of this winter and next spring, the city can eat an average of 0.613 catties of vegetables per person per day (only 0.343 catties per person were eaten last spring).

    This year, the city's vegetable planting area has been greatly expanded, and the relevant departments of the city have decided to vigorously support vegetable farmers in various aspects, such as providing technical guidance, signing pre-purchase contracts, and helping to overcome difficulties in seeds, fertilizers, timber, and funds. According to calculations, the required loans, together with the deposit for pre-purchasing autumn vegetables, are only equivalent to one-half of the expenses and losses incurred by transferring vegetables from other places last year. At the same time, reasonable seasonal purchase and sale prices are negotiated with all parties.

    哈尔滨市动手克服蔬菜供应的困难
    采取就近生产就近供应的根本办法
    本报讯　“就近生产，就近供应”，这是城市蔬菜供应的根本办法。哈尔滨市蔬菜供应的历史情况和老农的经验，证明这个办法就在气候寒冷、农作物生长期短的北方地区也可以行得通。
    过去，哈尔滨市在夏、秋两季可以生产三、四十种蔬菜，秋菜收获后，可以保存到来年的春末，接上新菜上市。所以过去并没有发生蔬菜供应紧张的问题。但是，近几年随着城市建设的开展，蔬菜供应不足的情况越来越严重。这个城市的人口1953年为一百零五万，1956年增加到一百四十五万。这期间，郊区蔬菜的种植面积和总产量虽有所增加，但与人口的增长及人民生活改善的速度比较是不相适应的。特别是供作冬、春两季消费的秋菜种植面积不但没有增加，反而下降了很多，仅大白菜和大萝卜两种即由1954年的七千一百公顷，减少为1956年的四千五百公顷。因此冬春两季不得不从远地大量调来蔬菜。去年从外地调进的蔬菜，占全市全年供应量的28％；所花费用一百六十五万元，占当地蔬菜公司全部开支80％以上，并因此赔了三十多万元，占全部资金一半多。而蔬菜供应并没有缓和下来，价格涨得很凶，严重地影响了市民的生活。
    造成哈尔滨市蔬菜供应情况紧张的原因固然很多，如城市人口增长过多过快，市郊基本建设的扩大，占用菜地过多等，但主要是经营蔬菜的方针不明确。这个城市的蔬菜的货源主要是依靠外地调进解决，而不是积极指导和扶助当地生产。甚至所采取的某些措施还影响了当地的生产，如季节差价定的过小，甚或常年一个价。结果，农民和消费者都不再贮藏蔬菜。蔬菜在收获季节集中上市，造成“菜贱伤农”，挫伤了农业社和农民种菜的积极性。
    为了彻底改善蔬菜供应的情况，中共哈尔滨市委和市人民委员会最近作出决定，把蔬菜生产放在郊区生产的首要地位，要求大路菜在今年内做到自产自足，冬、春季的黄瓜、西红柿等细菜争取大约在三年内自给。根据市民的吃菜水平并加上40％—50％的预防灾害的安全系数，把今年的蔬菜种植面积扩大为二万六千公顷，比1956年增加了四千多公顷。由于当地每年至少有六个多月不能生长蔬菜，还准备组织农业社、农民和有条件的集体伙食单位和市民尽量储存冬菜。连蔬菜公司储存的在内，初步计划今冬明春的半年中，全市每人每天平均可以吃到0.613斤菜（去年春季每人只吃到0.343斤）。
    今年全市蔬菜的种植面积扩大很多，市的有关部门决定从各方面大力扶助菜农，如给予技术指导，签订预购合同，帮助克服种子、肥料、木材、资金等困难。经计算，所需贷款连同预购秋菜的订金，只相当去年由外地调运蔬菜所花费用和赔损款的二分之一。同时，还同各方面协商制订合理的季节购销价格。
