Should Bourgeois Elements Continue to Be Reformed?
National Federation of Industry and Commerce Symposium Continues

(Our Newspaper) This newspaper reports that the National Federation of Industry and Commerce Symposium held its sixth session yesterday (21st), and all members of the symposium on industry and commerce reform guidance work convened by the Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association also participated in this symposium. The meeting was chaired by Li Weihan, Minister of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee. At noon, the United Front Work Department held a reception.

The meeting will continue today.

Wu Xianji said:
	The revolution has penetrated into the revolution of the capitalist's mind,
	The Federation of Industry and Commerce needs the Party's care and help even more

He also said: Some people have a particularly strong affection for capitalism. It cannot be assumed that after the means of production are handed over, all problems will be solved.

Wu Xianji, Deputy Secretary-General of the Nanjing Federation of Industry and Commerce, criticized at the meeting that the United Front Work Department and the Eighth Office, etc., did not provide new assistance to the Federation of Industry and Commerce based on the new situation after the high tide. He said that the revolution before the high tide was a revolution of the means of production, and at that time the United Front Work Department gave great help to the Federation of Industry and Commerce in terms of policies and ideology. After the high tide, the revolution has penetrated into the minds of every capitalist, and it is now a revolution of the capitalist's mind. At this time, the Federation of Industry and Commerce needs the Party's care and help even more.

Since the second half of last year, the work of the industrial and commercial circles has been arranged, and the levels have also been evaluated. It stands to reason that they should be more at ease with their work. But the fact is not so. Some people are always in a bad mood. When they are together, they always like to talk about their proud things in the past; when they talk about opinions on the public side, they are very interested; when they talk about the ideological transformation of private personnel, there are a lot of objective reasons; they talk strangely behind their backs, and some even quarrel in the office. He specifically stated that there were no quarrels in our Federation of Industry and Commerce before the high tide, but today, when we want to exert our independent role, we are quarreling instead. This shows that some people have a particularly strong affection for capitalism. It cannot be assumed that after the means of production are handed over, all problems will be solved.

Wu Xianji said: Gao Zhensheng, Secretary-General of the Hebei Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce, said, "There is no need to mention class stand if there is a common goal." I disagree with this statement. I also disagree with Bi Mingqi, Director of the Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce, who believes that the transformation of the national bourgeoisie has achieved complete victory today. Many people mentioned class relations at this meeting, and there are many opinions. Why pay so much attention to this issue? Why are you so afraid of hearing the words "bourgeoisie"? Secretary-General Gao saw that the Party members went to the meeting and thought that the "gap" was built by the leadership. Why think like this? This reflects the issue of trust in the Party. Bi Mingqi said: Handing over enterprises is not simple, it is after ideological struggle. This is right, it touches our hearts, but we should add another sentence, that is: "It is also painful to dig out the essence of bourgeois thought today." Otherwise, why do some people say "you communists, we industrial and commercial circles" at every turn, and draw a line between "you" and "us"? Who drew this gap?

Then he said that bourgeois elements have a lot of individualism, and the old ideas have not been dug out. Some work after the high tide could have been done better, but it was not done, and a lot of strength was eliminated. This also shows that ideological transformation is not easy. It also shows that the Party's care and help is even more needed.

Speaking of this, he deeply felt that after the Party member secretary-general of the Nanjing Federation of Industry and Commerce left, there was disunity within the Federation of Industry and Commerce. He said that this incident made me realize the role of the Party member secretary-general. Before the unity of the industrial and commercial circles is further strengthened and the ideology is further improved, the Party member secretary-general should not be transferred from the Federation of Industry and Commerce.

Li Yueqing said:
	If the public-private relationship is not handled well, the public side is the main aspect of the contradiction

Li Yueqing, Deputy Manager of the Shanghai Printing and Dyeing Industry Company, spoke next. He believed that the basic reason why the enthusiasm of industrialists and businessmen cannot be fully utilized is in the relationship between the public and private sectors. Some people still look at the new relationship with old eyes and deal with new problems with old methods. He said that some Party members have a fixed view of industrialists and businessmen, believing that industrialists and businessmen are just profit-seeking, full of capitalist ideas, and will spread poison at any time to corrode cadres. They are indifferent to socialism and irresponsible to the enterprise. Due to this narrow class prejudice, it is reflected in the actual work as distrust of private personnel. He cited many examples, such as some private personnel who are very active in their work and do not go home until very late every day, but what they get is not encouragement, but suspicion of ulterior motives; some public factory directors have already sent the list to the higher authorities for review when arranging the responsible personnel of the departments, before consulting with the private factory director, which is actually equivalent to false consultation. In a hotel area in Shanghai, every cadre has a key to the office, but the private personnel do not. Some public personnel not only distrust private personnel, but also discriminate against them.

He said: Because some people have a fixed view of private personnel, they do not praise them when they should be praised, and they do not criticize them when they should be criticized. In a factory in Shanghai, a private person gambles until late at night every day, goes to work very late in the morning, and leaves before get off work. Sometimes he even pulls workers to gamble together, but the public factory director does not criticize him.

He also mentioned that some Party member cadres have many shortcomings in their ideological style, such as employing people by favoritism, speaking without principles, being divorced from the masses, and taking the lead in not observing labor discipline, which all affect the progress of the work and the relationship between the public and private sectors.

Finally, he said: Of course, if the relationship between the public and private sectors is not handled well, private personnel also have shortcomings, but the public side is the main aspect of the contradiction. Therefore, we should especially strengthen the education of Party member cadres. Party member cadres should strengthen theoretical study and not always look at the new relationship with old eyes and deal with new problems with old methods.

Wu Bingjun said:
	There are class relations and working relations in joint ventures
		Currently, the focus should be on improving working relations

Wu Bingjun, Deputy Secretary-General of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce, said: At present, there are two relationships between the public and private sectors in joint ventures, namely class relations and working relations. No one denies this. However, which relationship is the main one at present should be clarified. I think the focus should be on improving the cooperative working relationship, that is, focusing on the working relationship; through the working relationship, we should implement the Party's policy of unity and education and resolve class relations.

He said: The reason why the relationship between the public and private sectors in joint ventures is not good and the enthusiasm of private personnel cannot be fully utilized is because the dual relationship has not been clarified. He also cited some examples to illustrate this point.

Li Hanhu said:
	Private personnel have four concerns about participating in the increase production and practice economy movement

Li Hanhu, Deputy Director of the Industrial and Commercial Reform Guidance Office of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association, introduced the situation of private personnel in Chongqing participating in the increase production and practice economy movement and making rationalization proposals. He said that because the public personnel did not support the enthusiasm of the private personnel enough, it considerably affected the enthusiasm of the private personnel. At present, there are four concerns among private personnel in Chongqing. First, they are afraid that the leaders will not trust them and will not support them. Second, they are afraid that the workers will misunderstand them and say that saving is cutting corners. Third, they are afraid of losing face if they fail. Fourth, they are afraid that they will not be able to bear the responsibility if they succeed. But the most important thing is to fear that the leaders will not trust them and will not support them.

Secondly, he also talked about the distribution of the gains from increasing production and practicing economy.

Min Zi said:
	Some industrialists and businessmen study theory in order to get some terms to deal with the public and scare the workers

He also believes that for a considerable period of time, there was a lot of praise for industrialists and businessmen, and necessary criticism was reduced, so some people became complacent.

Min Zi, Deputy Secretary-General of the Hangzhou Federation of Industry and Commerce, said that some industrialists and businessmen study theory not to transform their own thinking, but to get some theoretical terms and engage in a set of political capital to deal with the public and scare the workers. Therefore, they are dogmatic in their learning methods. The characteristics of their way of looking at problems are: grasping the phenomenon and denying the essence, grasping the individual and denying the whole. Some people emphasize the special circumstances of China and adopt a negative attitude towards universal experience.

He felt that at present, a considerable number of people in the industrial and commercial circles have the idea of "learning to the top." He said that an industrialist and businessman in Hangzhou once said: Now the contradictions between industrialists and businessmen and the working class are transforming and infiltrating each other. Bourgeois elements have socialist ideas, and these ideas are the same as the ideas of the working class. There are also capitalist ideas among the working class, and they are the same as the ideas of capitalists. This means that you have me in your thoughts, and I also have you in my thoughts. Some people request that fixed interest be paid once every seven years, so that they can get rid of their hats, that is, they do not need to be reformed anymore. Some people also believe that the bourgeoisie has technology and is the wealth of socialism. They also have a set of theories, and it seems that they are stronger than the public and stronger than the workers in all aspects. They do not need to be reformed; joint ventures can be hung with state-owned signs, and public representatives can be withdrawn. In the future, do not mention class relations and duality anymore. Here, it reflects that capitalists have something substantial that has not been taken out. Therefore, how to improve the theoretical study of industrialists and businessmen is still a current issue. Unfortunately, the Hangzhou Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Department manages the study of industrialists and businessmen very little, and the leaders of professional companies do not pay enough attention to the regular study of industrialists and businessmen.

At present, some leaders in the industrial and commercial circles are high above and divorced from the masses. In the leadership, it seems that "spring sleep does not awaken dawn," but in the masses, it is "everywhere you hear birds singing." The industrial and commercial circles should be responsible for this situation, and the Party and the government have also relaxed ideological leadership. Since the high tide, we have focused more on personnel arrangements and less on ideological education. There has been more encouragement and less necessary criticism. For a considerable period of time, all we have heard is praise, so some industrialists and businessmen have become complacent. If this continues, it will not benefit either the public or the private sectors.

### 资产阶级分子要不要继续改造？  全国工商界座谈会继续举行

    资产阶级分子要不要继续改造？
    全国工商界座谈会继续举行
    本报讯　全国工商界座谈会于昨日（21日）举行第六次座谈，民建中央召开的工商改造辅导工作座谈会的全部人员也参加了这个座谈会。会议由中共中央统战部部长李维汉主持。中午，统战部举行了招待会。
    会议将在今天继续进行。吴咸吉说：
    革命已深入到革资本家脑子的命，
    工商联就更需要党的关怀和帮助
    他还说：有些人对资本主义感情特别浓厚。不能设想，生产资料交出以后，就什么问题都没有了。
    南京市工商联副秘书长吴咸吉在会上发言，他对统战部、八办等部门没有根据高潮后新的情况给工商联以新的帮助提出了批评。他说，高潮以前的革命是革生产资料的命，当时统战部在政策思想上曾给工商联很大的帮助。高潮以后，革命已深入到每个资本家的脑子里去了，已是革资本家脑子的命了。这时，工商联就更需要党的关怀和帮助。
    从去年下半年起，工商界的工作都安排了，级别也评了。照理说应该更加安心工作了。但事实却并不如此，有些人总在闹情绪，在一起的时候，总爱谈过去自己得意的事情；拉起对公方的意见，就津津有味；拉起对私方人员的思想改造，就客观原因一大堆；背后说怪话，有的人甚至在办公室里吵架。他特别声明说：在高潮以前我们工商联是没有吵架的，而今天要自己发挥独立作用的时候，反而吵架了。这说明有些人对资本主义感情特别浓厚。不能设想，生产资料交出以后，就什么问题都没有了。
    吴咸吉说：河北省工商联秘书长高振声说“有共同的目的就不必再提什么阶级立场了”，我不同意这种说法。天津市工商联主任委员毕鸣岐认为今天对民族资产阶级的改造已经取得了完全的胜利的说法，我也不能同意。这次会上很多人提到阶级关系，意见就很多。为什么这样注意这个问题呢？为什么又这样怕听资产阶级这几个字呢？高秘书长看到党员们去开会就认为“鸿沟”是领导上建起来的，为什么这样想呢？这反映了对党的信任问题。毕鸣岐说：交出企业不是简单的，是经过思想斗争的，这话是对的，说到我们心里去了，但还应加上一句，这就是：“今天要挖出资产阶级思想本质，也是痛苦的。”否则，为什么有些人动不动就说“你们共产党，我们工商界”，在“你们”“我们”之间要划一条沟呢？这沟又是谁划的呢？
    接着他说，资产阶级分子个人主义的东西很多，旧的思想没有挖出来，高潮后有些工作，本来可以做得更好，但没有做到，很多力量对消了。这也说明思想改造是不容易的。也说明更需要党的关怀和帮助。
    谈到这里，他深深感到南京工商联党员秘书长离开以后，工商联内部出现了不团结的现象。他说，这件事，使我体会到党员秘书长的作用，在工商界的团结没有进一步加强和思想没有进一步提高以前，不应该把党员秘书长调离工商联。李樾卿说：
    公私关系没搞好，公方是矛盾的主要方面
    接着发言的是上海市印染工业公司副理李樾卿，他认为工商业者的积极性所以不能充分发挥，基本原因是在公私关系上。有些人仍以老眼光看待新关系，以老办法处理新问题。他说，有些党员对工商业者的看法是定了型的，认为工商业者就是唯利是图，满脑子的资本主义思想，随时都会散布毒素腐蚀干部，对社会主义是冷淡的，对企业是不负责任的。由于这种狭隘的阶级成见，反映在实际工作中，就是对私方人员不信任。他举了很多例子，如有的私方人员工作很积极，每天都很晚才回家，但是得到的不是鼓励，而是被怀疑为别有用意；有的公方厂长在安排科室负责人员时，已经将名单送给上级审查，才同私方厂长协商，实际上等于假协商。上海有个旅馆区，办公室的钥匙每个干部都有一把，就是私方人员没有。有些公方人员不但对私方人员不信任，而且还歧视。
    他说：由于有些人对私方人员的看法是定了型的，因此对私方人员该表扬的不表扬，该批评的也不批评。上海有个厂有个私方人员每天赌博到深夜，早晨很晚才上班，不到下班时间就走，有时还拉着工人一块去赌博，但是公方厂长也不批评他。
    他还提到，有些党员干部思想作风上存在很多缺点，如用人唯亲，说话无原则，脱离群众，带头不遵守劳动纪律等等，都影响工作的进行，影响公私关系。
    最后他说：当然，公私关系没搞好，私方人员也有缺点，但是公方是矛盾的主要方面。因此，应该特别加强对党员干部的教育。党员干部应加强理论学习，不要总用老眼光来看待新关系，用老办法来处理新问题。吴秉钧说：
    合营企业中有阶级关系和工作关系
          目前应以搞好工作关系为主
    北京市工商联合会副秘书长吴秉钧说：现在公私双方在合营企业中有两重关系，即阶级关系和工作关系，这是没有人否认的。但是，目前哪个关系是主要的，应明确。我认为目前应以搞好合作共事关系为主，即以工作关系为主；通过工作关系，贯彻党的团结教育方针，解决阶级关系。
    他说：目前合营企业中公私双方的关系所以搞不好，私方人员积极性不能充分发挥，就是由于没有搞清楚这双重关系的缘故。他并举了一些例子来说明这个问题。李汉湖说：
      私方人员参加增产节约有四种顾虑
    民建重庆市委工商改造辅导处副处长李汉湖介绍了重庆市私方人员参加增产节约运动和提合理化建议的情况。他说，由于公方人员对私方人员的积极性支持不够，相当地影响了私方人员的积极性。目前重庆私方人员存在着四种顾虑。一、怕领导不信任，不支持。二、怕职工们误会，把节约说成是偷工减料。三、怕搞不成丢面子。四、怕搞成了自己负不起责任。但最主要的是怕领导不信任不支持。
    其次，他还谈了增产节约所得的分配问题。闵子说：
      有些工商业者学习理论的目的是为了弄些名词对付公方吓唬工人
    他还认为：在相当长时间内，对工商业者是一片赞扬声，必要的批评少了，于是有些人就飘飘然起来了。
    杭州工商联副秘书长闵子说，有些工商业者学习理论的目的不是为了改造自己的思想，而是为了弄一些理论名词，搞一套政治资本，去对付公方、吓唬工人。因此，他们在学习方法上是教条主义的。他们看问题的特点是：抓住现象、否认本质，抓住个别、否认全部。有些人强调中国的特殊情况，对于普遍的经验采取了否定的态度。
    他感到目前工商界有相当一部分人有“学习到顶”的思想。他说，杭州有个工商业者曾经说过这样的话：现在工商业者与工人阶级的矛盾正在互相转化、互相渗透中，资产阶级分子有社会主义思想，这种思想和工人阶级的思想一样，在工人阶级当中也有资本主义思想，并且和资本家的思想一样，这就是说你的思想中有我，我的思想中也有你。有人要求定息七年一次发放，这样可以摘掉帽子，也就是说不要再改造了。还有一些人认为资产阶级有技术，是社会主义的财富，在理论上也有一套，似乎各方面都比公方强，比工人强，不要改造了；公私合营企业可以挂上国营的牌子了，公方代表可以撤走了，今后不要再提什么阶级关系和两面性了。这里，反映了资本家有一种实质的东西没有拿出来。因此，工商业者的理论学习如何提高仍是当前的问题。可惜，杭州市委宣传部对工商业者学习却管得很少，而专业公司领导方面对工商业者经常性的学习也不够重视。
    目前，工商界有些领导人员高高在上，脱离群众。在领导方面仿佛是“春眠不觉晓”，在群众方面却是“处处闻啼鸟”。这种情况，工商界要负责任，而党与政府放松了思想领导也有关系。高潮以来，对人事安排抓多了，对思想教育抓少了，鼓励多了一些，而必要的批评却少了一些。在相当长的时间内听到的是一片赞扬声，于是有些工商业者就飘飘然起来了。长此下去，对公对私都无好处。
