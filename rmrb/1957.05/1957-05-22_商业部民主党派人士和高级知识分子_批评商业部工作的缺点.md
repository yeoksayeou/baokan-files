This newspaper invited representatives of various democratic parties in the Ministry of Commerce and a group of senior intellectuals to a symposium on the 18th. Those who participated in the symposium were Li Guifeng (alternate member of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang [RCCK], member of the RCCK branch of the Ministry of Commerce), Geng Mingyun (RCCK group leader), Ma Zhengping (chairman of the RCCK branch), Jiang Anxiang (RCCK branch committee member), Xiong Huisan (member of the China Democratic League branch), Liu Ruirao (member of the China National Democratic Construction Association branch), and engineers Zhu Yunpeng, Tao Dingcheng, Li Jin, Fang Caizheng, Wang Shouchang, Jia Zungeng, and Fang Zhipu, a total of thirteen people. Li Guifeng said:

    Democratic parties are not valued within the organization. How can the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" be implemented?

    Li Guifeng said at the symposium that the CCP Committee of the Ministry of Commerce does not value the work of the democratic parties, and individual leaders of the Ministry of Commerce also look down on the democratic parties. Meetings in the organization only include the Party, government, labor union, and the Communist Youth League, and rarely mention the democratic parties.
      The policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" should not be limited to a few symposiums held by the United Front Work Department, but should be implemented in every corner. The CCP leads the study, the administrative leaders lead the work, and there is still a lack of specific methods for how the democratic parties can play a role.

    The Ministry of Commerce leads its subordinates not based on real ability, but by suppressing them with its authority. The accounting system has been revised several times, without understanding the actual situation before the revisions, and without listening to the opinions raised by subordinates. Only the person in charge makes the decision. People are blocked by a simple sentence: "The Ministry decided," or "The regulations stipulate." Subordinates call the regulations "the Bible," and the people who draft the regulations "saints."

    The anti-rightist movement was correct, but some people disagree with their conclusions. Now, in conjunction with Party rectification, the issues should be clarified. Zhu Yunpeng said:

    The Ministry of Commerce does not trust engineering and technical personnel

    Zhu Yunpeng said: The Ministry of Commerce only uses our engineering and technical personnel, lacking trust and support. Vice Minister Wang Xingrang once said at a meeting that after we determine the plan and policy, you just follow it. At that time, someone suggested: "We engineers are responsible for national construction, not hired to play number games." Vice Minister Wang Xingrang immediately said that he had misspoke. This shows the leadership's attitude towards us. Liu Ruirao said:

    The Ministry of Commerce's policies and guidelines are constantly changing

    Liu Ruirao said: The Ministry of Commerce's policies and guidelines are constantly changing, with frequent and rapid shifts, and little debate. For example, the organizational structure sometimes extends downwards and sometimes contracts. Another example is the issue of selling on credit in 1956 and the issue of expanding the variety of commodities. These were all decided by the leaders of the Ministry without any debate among everyone. Decisions are made too hastily, leading to many problems. The business bureaus of the Ministry of Commerce change three times a year. Now, it looks like a business bureau, but it doesn't quite seem like one. So they say, "This organization is a special organizational form!" There are no clear regulations about what each bureau does. When something comes up, everyone passes the buck, and often a document cannot be transferred out for a month or two.

    In the past seven years, the Ministry of Commerce has done a lot of work, but it has not done basic construction work, and is accustomed to patching things up and engaging in piecemeal buying and selling. Wang Shouchang said:

    Business cannot be done using the method of launching movements

    Wang Shouchang said: It is not feasible to use the method of launching movements to do business. We often shout when there are slightly too many goods, and then shout again when there are slightly not enough goods. This kind of movement almost has a cycle of one year. In fact, the leadership's understanding of what constitutes overstocking and what constitutes stockouts is not consistent. In 1954 and 1955, the chemical company overstocked over 160 million yuan worth of dyes alone. But recently, the Ministry has said that it does not count as overstocking. Of course, according to today's situation, it is not overstocked. But that was three years ago, and there have been no imports of dyes in the past two years. Fang Zhipu said:

    Leading cadres do not study their business and only complain about difficulties

    Fang Zhipu said: In the past, the hardware and machinery company mainly managed production materials. In the winter of 1954, the leadership proposed to switch to managing civilian hardware materials. The quantity of civilian hardware in China is small, and the variety is also small. If it is all converted to civilian use, there is nothing to manage. Why switch? It is only based on the theory that "production materials are withdrawn from the commodity circulation field." Subordinate cadres are ideologically confused about this decision, which directly affects the progress of the business.

    The management of scientific instruments is complex and highly technical, so the company leaders are afraid of it. At the same time, because the amount of money sold is small and the work is trivial, the company leaders decided in 1954 not to manage it. In the same year, after Premier Zhou put forward the call to march towards science, instruments could not be bought on the market, which caused great dissatisfaction among people in society. After that, the leaders felt that it was not possible not to manage it, but how to manage it well? It has not been resolved. In the past, we proposed the establishment of a specialized instrument company, but the Ministry of Commerce disagreed. Can the one-sided emphasis on complexity and too much technicality be used as an excuse for not studying the business? Tao Dingcheng said:

    The design and installation company should merge with the Petroleum Exploration and Design Institute

    Tao Dingcheng said: The Ministry of Commerce has a temporary view of the petroleum company, and an even more temporary view of the design and installation company. Since its establishment, the task has expanded tenfold, but the number of design personnel has not increased.

    In the first five-year plan, we did not make a plan, but only relied on the subjective imagination of a few leaders to determine the task. Therefore, two-thirds of our design time is spent on rework.

    The Petroleum Industry Department's Exploration and Design Institute has sufficient manpower, but no work, so it has to solicit business from us. The masses on both sides are willing to merge, but the commercial departments insist that the design and installation company must be taken over together with the petroleum company, otherwise they will not let us go. The Ministry of Commerce is treating us as bargaining chips.

    Engineer Jia Zungeng said: As soon as we mentioned the opinion of merging, the leaders said that we had a contempt for commerce. However, the contempt for commerce comes from the leaders. When the State Council allocates construction materials, because we are in the Ministry of Commerce, we are placed at the back, regardless of whether our project is important. Fang Caizheng said:

    The flower of "scientific use of oil materials" must be released

    Fang Caizheng said: I am engaged in the technology of using oil materials. However, for this work, I am the only one, with no experts above and no assistants below. I have no position, authority, or responsibility, and I am placed in a corner of the business office, like an information desk. This has been the way I have been treated for seven years. The Party has proposed marching towards science, and we proactively sent the plan to march towards science to the Ministry, but nothing was heard. Some people said that the plan may have become a "let-go" plan. Now that a hundred flowers are blooming, the flower of scientific use of oil materials must also be released. Geng Mingyun said:

    The Ministry of Commerce has a particularly deep sense of hierarchy

    Geng Mingyun said: The cadres promoted last year were all Party members and members of the Communist Youth League. Non-CCP members have rarely been promoted since the grading in 1952. The Finance and Accounting Bureau one-sidedly interprets "virtue" as meaning that as long as you are a Party member or member of the Communist Youth League, you have virtue, and other people have no virtue.

    The Ministry of Commerce has a very strong bureaucratic style and a particularly deep sense of hierarchy. Even what kind of chair a cadre of what level sits on is stipulated. The privileged thinking of Party members is also very obvious. For example, Office Director Huo Weisheng joked about marriage and divorce. When the masses said something, it was considered intentionally undermining the prestige of the leadership, attacking the Party, and dissatisfied with the Party. As a result, the Personnel Department even asked the masses to examine themselves. Xiong Huisan said:

    The integration of the Party and the government is not good

    Xiong Huisan said: Why does the Ministry of Commerce have bureaucracy, sectarianism, and dogmatism? Why do policies and guidelines sometimes lean left and sometimes lean right? The main reason is that the integration of the Party and the government is not good. A matter is always studied and decided by the Party organization and then handed over to the business unit for implementation. The promotion of cadres is also studied and decided within the Party. Within the organization, it should be changed in terms of the system. The Party should be concerned with ideological education issues, and the administration should manage business work. Democratic parties should be involved in the study of business policies and guidelines. Major policies and measures should be discussed by all cadres in the Ministry.

    Ma Zhengping and Jiang Anxiang hoped in their speeches that the CCP Committee of the Ministry of Commerce would further invite the masses to participate in symposiums and criticize the shortcomings and errors in the work.

    商业部民主党派人士和高级知识分子
    批评商业部工作的缺点
    本报讯　本报于18日邀请商业部各民主党派的代表和一部分高级知识分子举行座谈会，参加座谈的有李贵凤（民革北京市候补委员、商业部民革支部委员）、耿明允（民革小组长）、马正平（民革支部主任委员）、姜安祥（民革支委）、熊惠三（民盟支委）、刘瑞尧（民建支委）和工程师朱云鹏、陶定诚、李进、方才政、王绶昌、贾遵庚、方治朴等十三人。李贵凤说：
    民主党派在机关内部不被重视，如何贯彻“长期共存、互相监督”的方针？
    李贵凤在座谈会上说：中共商业部党委对民主党派的工作不重视，商业部的个别领导人也有轻视民主党派的。机关开会只是党、政、工、团，很少提到民主党派。
      “长期共存、互相监督”的方针不是统战部开几个座谈会就算，而应贯彻到各个角落。学习由中共党领导，工作由行政领导，民主党派如何发挥作用还缺乏具体方法。
    商业部对下面领导，不是凭真本事，而是以帽子压人。几次修改会计制度，改前不了解实际情况，下面提的意见也不听，只由主管人决定。只以一句话“部里决定”、“制度规定”来挡人。下级叫制度为“圣经”，拟制度的人为“圣人”。
    肃反运动是正确的，但有些人对自己结论不同意。现在应该结合整党，把问题搞清楚。朱云鹏说：
    商业部不信任工程技术人员
    朱云鹏说：商业部对我们工程技术人员只有使用，缺乏信任和支持。王兴让副部长在一次会议上曾说过，我们把计划方针确定以后，你们就照作。当时有人提出：“我们工程师是要对国家建设负责的，不是被雇佣来作数字游戏的”。王兴让副部长才马上说他说错了话。由此可见领导上对我们是什么态度。刘瑞尧说：
    商业部政策方针摇摆不定
    刘瑞尧说：商业部政策方针摇摆不定，变化多而快，鸣得少。例如组织机构一会下伸，一会收缩。又如1956年赊销问题，扩大商品经营品种问题，都是部的领导决定的，没经过大家争鸣。决定问题太草率，带来问题很多。商业部业务局一年变三次。现在看起来，好像是业务局，又不像业务局。所以他们说“这机构是特殊的组织形式！”哪个局干什么，没有明确规定。事情一来，大家踢皮球，往往一个公文，一两个月都转不出去。
    七年来商业部作了很多工作，但是不作带基本性建设的工作，习惯于修修补补，零买零卖。王绶昌说：
    不能用搞运动的方法搞业务
    王绶昌说：用搞运动的方法搞业务是不行的。我们常常是商品稍一多，就喊；商品稍一不够，又喊。这种运动，几乎一年一个周期。其实什么叫积压，什么叫脱销，领导上的认识也不一致。1954和1955年，光染料一项，化工公司就积压了价值一亿六千多万元。但是最近部里研究又说那不算积压。如果根据今天情况说当然不积压。但是那是三年前的事，而且近两年来都没有进口染料。方治朴说：
    领导干部不钻研业务，一味叫困难
    方治朴说：五金机械公司过去主要经营生产资料，1954年冬，领导上提出要转向民用五金器材的经营。中国民用五金数量少，种类也少，如全部转民用，就没什么可经营的了。为什么要转？只是根据“生产资料退出商品流通领域”这一条理论。下面干部对这个决定思想模糊，直接影响到业务的进行。
    经营科学仪器复杂、技术性高，公司领导上因此害怕；同时因卖钱额较小，工作琐碎，公司领导上在1954年决定不经营。同年，周总理提出向科学进军后，市场上买不到仪器，引起社会人士很大不满。此后，领导上感觉到不经营不行，但如何经营才好？却没解决。过去我们曾提出成立专门的仪器公司，商业部不同意。片面强调复杂、技术性太强，就可以作为不钻研业务的借口吗？陶定诚说：
    设计安装公司应该和
    石油勘查设计院合并
    陶定诚说：商业部对石油公司是临时观点，对设计安装公司更是临时观点。从成立到现在，任务扩大了十倍，设计人员未增加。
    第一个五年计划，我们没有作规划，只凭几个领导人主观想像决定任务。因此我们的设计一年中有三分之二的时间在返工。
    石油工业部勘查设计院有充分人力，但无工作，只好向我们兜揽生意。双方群众都愿意合并，商业部门坚持设计安装公司必须同石油公司一起接过去才行，否则不放我们走。商业部把我们当成交易的资本了。
    贾遵庚工程师说：我们一提合并的意见，领导上就说我们是轻商思想。但是，轻商思想是从领导上来的。国务院分配建设器材，因为我们在商业部，就把我们排到后面，不管我们工程是否重要。方才政说：
    “油料使用科学”这朵花一定要放出来
    方才政说：我是搞油料使用技术的。可是这个工作，就我一个人，上无专家，下无助手，职、权、责全没有，就把我摆在业务处的一个角落上，好比询问处一样，有事就来问问。七年来，一直是这样对待我。党提出了向科学进军，我们主动地把向科学进军的方案送到部里，不见下闻。有人说，方案可能成了“放”案。现在百花齐放，油料使用科学这朵花，也一定要把它放出来。耿明允说：
    商业部等级观念特别深
    耿明允说：去年提拔的干部都是党团员。非中共党员群众从1952年评级以后很少提拔。财会局把
  “德”片面理解为只要党团员就是有德，其他的人就没有德。
    商业部旧官僚习气很浓厚，等级观念特别深，连那级干部坐什么椅子都有规定。党员的特权思想，也是非常明显的。例如处长霍维胜拿结婚、离婚开玩笑，群众一说，就是有意破坏领导威信，向党进攻，对党不满。结果人事处还要群众检讨。 熊惠三说：
    党政合一不好
    熊惠三说：商业部为什么会有官僚主义、宗派主义、教条主义？为什么方针政策忽左忽右？主要由于党政合一不好。一件事情，总是由党组织研究决定，交业务单位执行。对提拔干部，也是党内研究决定。在机关内部，应从制度上改变。党过问思想教育问题，行政上管业务工作。研究业务方针政策时，应吸收民主党派参加。重大政策措施，应由部内所有的干部讨论。
    马正平和姜安祥在发言中希望商业部党委进一步邀请群众座谈，批评工作中的缺点和错误。
