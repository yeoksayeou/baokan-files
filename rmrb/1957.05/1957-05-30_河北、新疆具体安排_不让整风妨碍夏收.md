Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 28th: Hebei Province has entered the busy season of agricultural production. In order to ensure the timely completion of tasks such as the summer harvest and summer planting, the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has decided to postpone the rectification and inspection.

If there are no special disasters, the total output of summer harvest crops and late-maturing crops in Hebei Province this year is expected to reach about 10 billion jin, accounting for more than half of the total annual grain production plan. Therefore, the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has decided that the rectification and inspection of the prefectural, county-level, and relevant provincial departments (such as agriculture and water conservancy departments) can be appropriately postponed to around July and August. After the postponement of rectification and inspection, the prefectural, county-level, and relevant provincial departments should dispatch a large number of cadres to go deep into the countryside, guide work with the spirit of rectification, and do a good job in agricultural production. At the same time, during the busy farming season, various local organs, troops, and schools should try their best to provide support to enhance the unity between the Party and the masses.

The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China pointed out that although the rectification and inspection are postponed, all localities must, in their actual work, discover problems, find the key to the main contradictions, and propose solutions, so as to enrich the content of rectification with practical work and lay the foundation for rectification and inspection and improvement of the Party's ideological style.

This newspaper reports: In order to prevent closed-door rectification from affecting current agricultural production, after the closing of the enlarged meeting of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China, Comrade Wang Enmao instructed the autonomous prefectural governors, commissioners, and prefectural party secretaries who attended the meeting to consider the specific local circumstances when arranging rectification work upon their return. If the situation does not permit, rectification can be postponed to ensure a good harvest this year.

Since the beginning of spring, the climate in various parts of Xinjiang has been cold and warm alternately, changing unpredictably. In May, there were two heavy snowfalls around Urumqi. Due to the alternating cold and heat, the ground temperature was low, affecting the emergence of cotton seedlings. In the production and construction corps, the emergence of cotton seedlings in farms located north of the Tianshan Mountains accounts for about 10% of the sown area; in farms located south of the Tianshan Mountains, only 30% to 50% of the seedlings have emerged. Currently, winter wheat in southern Xinjiang is flowering and filling, and winter wheat in northern Xinjiang is heading, and preparations for pre-irrigation should be carried out in a timely manner. Due to the fact that during the distribution and rectification of agricultural cooperatives last winter and this spring, some problems were left unresolved in a timely manner, there are many contradictions between cooperative members and cooperative cadres.

Under these circumstances, if various localities concentrate too many leading cadres and carry out rectification behind closed doors, it will inevitably bring new difficulties to the agricultural cooperatives, inevitably deepen the contradictions between cooperative members and leading cadres, and affect this year's agricultural production.

### 河北、新疆具体安排  不让整风妨碍夏收

    河北、新疆具体安排
    不让整风妨碍夏收
    新华社保定28日电　河北省农业生产的繁忙季节已经到来，为保证及时地完成夏收夏种等任务，中共河北省委决定推迟整风检查。
    河北省今年的夏收作物和下茬晚熟作物如果没有特殊灾害，总产量约可达到一百亿斤左右，占全年粮食计划总产量的半数以上。因此中共河北省委决定，凡有夏收夏种任务的专区、县两级和省级有关部门（如农业、水利部门等）的整风检查，可以适当地推迟到7、8月前后进行，在整风检查推迟以后，专区、县级和省有关部门应该抽调大批干部深入农村，以整风精神指导工作，搞好农业生产。同时，各地机关、部队、学校，在农忙的紧张阶段，应该尽力设法支援，以增强党和群众之间的团结。
    中共河北省委指出：虽然整风检查推迟，各地必须在实际工作中，做到发现问题，找出主要矛盾的关键所在，提出解决办法，以工作实践来充实整风内容，为整风检查、改进党的思想作风打下基础。
    本报讯　为了防止关门整风影响当前农业生产，在中共新疆维吾尔自治区委员会扩大会议闭幕之后，王恩茂同志叮嘱参加会议的自治州州长、专员和地委书记回去布置整风工作时，要看当地具体情况；如果情况不允许，可以将整风推迟一步，以保证今年农业丰收。
    入春以来，新疆各地气候乍寒乍暖，变化无常，5月里，乌鲁木齐一带还下过两场大雪。由于时冷时热，地温较低，影响了棉花的出苗。生产建设兵团分布在天山以北的农场，棉花出苗约占播种面积10％左右；分布在天山以南的农场也只有30％到50％出苗。目前，南疆的冬麦正在扬花灌浆，北疆的冬麦正在吐穗，预分的准备工作应抓紧时机进行。由于去年冬季和今年春季，许多农业社在分配和整社当中，遗留了若干问题没有及时地解决，社员和社干部之间有着许多矛盾。
    在这种情况下，如果各地过多地集中领导干部，关起门来整风，势必给农业社带来新的困难，势必加深社员和领导干部之间的矛盾，影响今年的农业生产。
