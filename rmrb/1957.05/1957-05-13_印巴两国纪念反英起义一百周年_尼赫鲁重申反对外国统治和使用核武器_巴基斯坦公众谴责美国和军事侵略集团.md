Xinhua News Agency Comprehensive Report: According to Xinhua News Agency, the people of India and Pakistan began commemorating the centenary of the anti-British uprising on the 10th.

On May 10, 1857, an uprising against British rulers broke out in Meerut, a town near Delhi, and then spread to other parts of the India-Pakistan subcontinent. In this uprising, Muslims and Hindus fought together for freedom and independence, and many sacrificed their lives.

The major Indian political parties, the Congress Party, the Communist Party, and the People's Socialist Party, held conferences, demonstrations, and other commemorative activities in Delhi.

Prime Minister Nehru delivered a speech at a conference held by the Congress Party. He said that India would never accept foreign rule, nor would it succumb to superior military power, even if it had to wage a struggle for freedom with sticks, stones, and fists. Nehru also said that unless India is economically independent, it can never be independent; therefore, India must establish heavy industry.

Nehru once again expressed his opposition to the use of atomic and thermonuclear weapons. He said that the world today must choose between hydrogen bombs and peaceful coexistence. Nehru also condemned the British policy of "divide and rule." He said that the British separated Hindus and Muslims, making them hostile to each other. This was the secret of the British conquest of India.

The Communist Party of India organized another grand rally in Gandhi Square. People sang songs praising the glorious deeds of ordinary Indians resisting the British army and recited patriotic poems.

Members of the People's Socialist Party, wearing red hats, held another rally in front of the Red Fort. They demanded that the statues of the British imperialists of that time be removed from Delhi.

Mass parades and mass meetings were also held in all important riot centers and locations in India. In Meerut, where the first riot was ignited, demonstrations and public gatherings were held, and fireworks were set off in the evening.

Parades were held in major cities in Pakistan on the 10th, and people also prayed in mosques for the martyred heroes.

Mian Iftikharuddin, leader of the Pakistan National Party, said at a mass rally in Karachi that it was a mockery of history that the Baghdad Pact Council meeting was being held in Pakistan just as the entire country was commemorating the centenary of the 1857 uprising.

Iftikharuddin said that it is the responsibility of the Pakistani people today to oppose the world's largest imperialist country, the United States, which is trying to rule weak countries through economic and military aid.

Another National Party leader, Wu Mu Saeed, encouraged people to take an oath on this day to fight against imperialism all over the world.

The Pakistan National Party conference, which opened in Karachi on May 9, passed a resolution demanding that the Pakistani government abandon its current "submissive diplomacy" and pursue an independent policy of non-alignment. The resolution opposed Pakistan's participation in military alliances and "imperialist and colonialist blocs."

Staff of the Karachi Civil Liberties Committee have been on a hunger strike in front of the Presidential Palace since the 7th in support of public demands that Pakistan withdraw from the Baghdad Pact and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

Eight people have already participated in the hunger strike. They demanded the cancellation of the Baghdad Pact Council meeting to be held in Karachi from June 3 to 5. In a statement, they said, "We swear that the Baghdad Pact meeting to be held in Pakistan can only be held on our corpses. We commemorate the centenary of the anti-British uprising of 1857 by participating in the hunger strike."

    印巴两国纪念反英起义一百周年
    尼赫鲁重申反对外国统治和使用核武器  巴基斯坦公众谴责美国和军事侵略集团
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：印度和巴基斯坦两国人民从10日开始纪念反英大起义一百周年。
    1857年5月10日，反对英国统治者的起义在德里附近的一个市镇密拉特爆发，然后蔓延到印度—巴基斯坦次大陆的其他地方。在这次起义中，穆斯林同印度教徒一起为争取自由和独立进行了斗争，许多人献出了生命。
    印度主要政党国大党、共产党和人民社会党在德里举行了大会、示威游行和其他纪念活动。
    尼赫鲁总理在国大党举行的一次大会上发表了演说。他说，印度决不接受外国的统治，也决不在优势的军事力量下屈服，即使必须用棍子、石块和拳头进行争取自由的斗争也在所不惜。尼赫鲁又说，只要印度在经济上不能独立，它就永远不能独立，因此，印度得建立重工业。
    尼赫鲁又一次表示反对使用原子武器和热核武器。他说，世界今天将在氢弹和和平共处之间作一选择。尼赫鲁还谴责英国人“分而治之”的政策。他说，英国人把印度教徒和穆斯林分开，使他们互相敌对。这是英国人能够征服印度的秘诀。
    印度共产党在甘地广场组织了另一个盛大集会。人们歌唱了赞扬普通印度人反抗英国军队的光荣事迹的歌曲，并且朗诵了爱国诗。
    带红帽的人民社会党党员们另外在红堡前面举行集会。他们要求把当时的英帝国主义者的雕像从德里拆掉。
    印度所有重要的暴动中心和地点也都举行了群众游行和群众大会。在燃起第一个暴动火花的密拉特，举行了示威游行和公众大会，晚间还燃放了焰火。
    巴基斯坦各重要城市在10日举行游行，人们还在清真寺里为殉难烈士祈祷。
    巴基斯坦国民党领袖米安·伊夫蒂卡鲁丁在卡拉奇的一个群众集会上说，正当巴基斯坦全国纪念1857年起义一百周年的时候，巴格达条约理事会会议在巴基斯坦举行，这简直是对历史的嘲笑。
    伊夫蒂卡鲁丁说，今天反对世界上最大的帝国主义国家美国是巴基斯坦人民的责任，美国力图通过经济和军事援助统治弱国。
    另一个国民党领袖吴·穆·赛义德鼓励人们在这一天立誓对全世界的帝国主义进行斗争。
    5月9日在卡拉奇开幕的巴基斯坦国民党会议通过了一项决议，要求巴基斯坦政府放弃它目前的“屈从外交”、奉行一种不参加集团的独立政策。决议反对巴基斯坦参加军事联盟和“帝国主义及殖民主义集团”。
    卡拉奇公民自由委员会的工作人员为了支持公众提出的巴基斯坦应该退出巴格达条约和东南亚条约组织的要求，从7日起在总统府门前实行绝食。
    参加绝食的已经有八个人。他们要求取消将自6月3日到5日在卡拉奇举行的巴格达条约理事会会议。他们在一篇声明中说，“我们发誓，即将在巴基斯坦举行的巴格达条约会议只能在我们的尸体上召开，我们以参加绝食来纪念1857年反英大起义一百周年”。
