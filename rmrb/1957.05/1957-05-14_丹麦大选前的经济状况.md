The Danish general election will be held on May 14. Since the Social Democratic Party of Denmark formed a cabinet in October 1953, it has experienced two cabinet crises due to the foreign exchange crisis in the past three years. The second largest party in Denmark, the Farmer's Party and the Conservative Party, have criticized the Social Democratic Party for failing to fulfill its promises to increase production, improve the economy, reform the tax system, and stabilize foreign exchange.

Denmark is a highly developed capitalist agricultural and industrial country, but it is economically very dependent on the United States, Britain, and especially Britain. This is because Britain has huge investments in Denmark, and it is also the main sales market for Danish agricultural and livestock products.

Denmark's agriculture is quite developed and is known for its high yields, especially livestock products, such as butter, bacon, and eggs, most of which are exported. Industry is also mainly food processing and canning, followed by chemical, construction, shipbuilding, and agricultural machinery industries. Because the steel, non-metallic raw materials, and fuels needed in industry all depend on foreign imports, and mainly rely on exporting agricultural and livestock products to earn foreign exchange to purchase industrial equipment and raw materials, Denmark's industrial base is very unstable. The value of foreign trade imports and exports accounts for two-thirds of the national income, so whether the balance of foreign trade has a great impact on the Danish economy.

In 1956, especially in the second half of the year, due to the decline in industrial and agricultural production and the reduction in exports, the trade deficit for the whole year reached more than 1.4 billion kroner. The situation continued to deteriorate in January and February of this year, with a deficit of 458.6 million kroner, more than double that of the same period in 1956. The foreign exchange deficit increased rapidly, and the deficit in mid-April increased from 23.2 million kroner at the beginning of the year to 36.5 million kroner. Therefore, various political parties have criticized the Social Democratic government for being unable to cope with Denmark's economic difficulties.

According to 1953 statistics, the average value of foreign trade per capita in Denmark was 430 US dollars, ranking first among major capitalist countries such as the United States, Britain, and West Germany. At present, Denmark's foreign trade deficit has increased sharply, mainly due to the following reasons:

First, the export market for agricultural and livestock products has shrunk, and the export volume has decreased.

The export of agricultural and livestock products accounts for 60% of Denmark's total exports. Since the beginning of 1956, exports have encountered serious difficulties in shrinking markets. In the past, 54% of Denmark's agricultural and livestock products were exported, of which exports to the United Kingdom accounted for 50% of the total export value of agricultural and livestock products. However, since 1954, the United Kingdom's imports of Danish agricultural and livestock products have begun to decline, because the United Kingdom's domestic production of agricultural and livestock products has increased, and import restrictions have been adopted. At the same time, due to the Imperial Preference system, agricultural and livestock products from New Zealand and Australia are given priority for import into the United Kingdom, which makes Danish agricultural and livestock products squeezed in the British market.

Denmark's second largest customer is West Germany. In recent years, domestic consumption in West Germany has increased, but due to the dumping of agricultural products by the United States in West Germany, and the competition between Dutch eggs and cheese in West Germany and Denmark, the West German government has adopted methods to encourage domestic agricultural production, which has led to an increase in agricultural production. Therefore, the market for Danish agricultural and livestock products in West Germany is also threatened.

Second, unequal "liberalization" scope and tariff barriers.

Denmark is a member of the European Payments Union, and implements so-called "liberalization" of imports. According to 1956 statistics, the "liberalization" percentage of various materials imported by Denmark from the Union region was 85%. In the past, in order to protect its textile industry, Denmark implemented a certain restriction system on textile imports. From March 1957, the import of textiles was also forced to "liberalize."

The "liberalization" percentage of US dollar zone material imports also reached 55%. Due to "liberalization" and low tariffs, a large number of foreign industrial and agricultural products are imported, while Denmark's agricultural and livestock product exports are faced with tariff barriers everywhere.

Third, the imbalance of import and export prices.

Taking 1935 as 100 for the import and export price index, export prices fell by 41 from November 1955 to 1956, while import prices rose by 12 during the same period. Especially after the Suez Canal was blocked last year, Denmark's imported solid and liquid fuels rose by 30%-40%. Denmark's imported fuels accounted for 20% of the total import value in 1956. Of the 1.4 billion kroner in foreign trade deficit in 1956, 300 million kroner were due to the increase in import prices, of which fuel price increases accounted for 250 million kroner.

The export prices of Denmark's main agricultural and livestock products have plummeted due to the shrinking capacity of Western markets for Danish products. At present, egg prices fell to the lowest level after the war in early March, down 25% from 1956, pork fell 23%, and butter fell 28%. The decline in livestock product prices has also led to a decline in grain prices. It is estimated that if the current price level is maintained, Denmark's agricultural income will be reduced by 700 million kroner in 1957, which is equivalent to more than 10% of the total agricultural output value and more than 25% of farmers' income.

The above factors have deteriorated Denmark's foreign trade situation.

Due to the bumper harvest of feed in 1956, the number of live pigs increased, and the pork production in 1957 is estimated to increase by 10%. Also, due to the warm climate last winter, egg production will also increase by 10%. Therefore, people from all walks of life in Denmark are deeply afraid that the agricultural crisis of the 1930s will come again. Because the general election is imminent, large agricultural capitalists are vigorously publicizing the current agricultural crisis in order to attack the Social Democratic Party government, and at the same time, they are demanding: lower wages and reduce production costs; improve product quality and enhance competitiveness; tighten agricultural production and kill 15%-20% of the sows; implement krone devaluation, etc. The Social Democratic Party government has not formally accepted the demands of agricultural capitalists for fear of losing votes, and emphasizes the rise of Danish industrial exports in recent years, advocating attracting foreign capital and vigorously developing Danish export industries. Denmark has been developing export industries since the war, and the proportion of industrial products in exports has been increasing, but because the only industrial products with strong competitiveness in Denmark are ships and hardware, it is still difficult to expand the market.

    丹麦大选前的经济状况
            普凡
    丹麦将在5月14日进行大选。丹麦社会民主党自1953年10月组阁后，三年来，由于外汇危机曾连续发生过两次阁潮。丹麦第二大党农民党和保守党等，曾纷纷攻击社会民主党没有实现增加生产、改善经济、改革税制和稳定外汇的诺言。
    丹麦是一个资本主义高度发展的农工业国家，但是在经济上对美、英，特别是英国的依附性很大。这是由于英国在丹麦有巨额投资，它又是丹麦农畜产品的主要销售市场。
    丹麦的农业相当发达，素以高产量著称，尤其是畜产品最为丰富，其中如牛油、腌肉、鸡蛋等，大部分供出口。工业也主要是食品加工业、罐头工业，其次是化学、建筑、造船、农业机械等工业。由于工业中所需要的钢铁、非金属原料及燃料都依赖国外输入，而且主要是依靠输出农畜产品赚取外汇，购买工业设备和原料，所以丹麦的工业基础很不稳固。对外贸易进出口值占国民收入的三分之二，因此，对外贸易的平衡与否对丹麦经济影响很大。
    在1956年，特别是下半年，由于工农业生产下降，出口减少，全年贸易逆差达到十四亿克朗以上。今年1、2月份情况继续恶化，逆差额达四万五千八百六十万克朗，超过1956年同期的两倍多。外汇赤字迅速增加，4月中的赤字已由年初的二万三千二百万克朗增为三万六千五百万克朗。因此，各政党纷纷攻击社会民主党政府无法应付丹麦的经济困难。
    根据1953年统计，对外贸易按人口平均值，丹麦为四百三十美元，和美、英、西德等主要资本主义国家比较，丹麦居第一位。目前丹麦对外贸易入超剧增，主要的有以下几个原因：
    一、农畜产品的出口市场缩小，出口量下降。
    农畜产品的出口占丹麦总出口的60％。从1956年初以来，出口遇到了市场缩小的严重困难。过去丹麦农畜产品的54％供出口，其中输往英国的，占农畜产品总出口值的50％。但从1954年起，英国进口丹麦的农畜产品开始下降，原因是英国国内的农畜产品生产增加了，而且采取了限制进口的政策。同时，由于帝国特惠制，新西兰和澳大利亚等国的农畜产品优先输入英国，使得丹麦的农畜产品在英国市场上受到排挤。
    丹麦的第二大主顾是西德，近年来西德国内的消费是增加了，但由于美国在西德倾销农产品，荷兰的鸡蛋和乳酪也在西德和丹麦竞争，西德政府又采取了鼓励本国农业生产的办法，使农产有了增加。因此，丹麦农畜产品在西德的市场也受到威胁。
    二、不平等的“自由化”范围和关税壁垒。
    丹麦是欧洲支付同盟的成员国，进口实行所谓“自由化”。按1956年的统计，丹麦从该联盟地区进口各项物资的“自由化”百分比为八十五。以前丹麦为保护其纺织业，对纺织品进口实行一定限制制度，从1957年3月开始，纺织品的进口也被迫“自由化”了。
    美元区物资进口“自由化”的百分比也达55％。由于“自由化”和低关税，结果外国的工农业品大量入口，而丹麦的农畜产品出口却处处遭到关税壁垒的障碍。
    三、进出口的价格不平衡。
    进出口的价格指数以1935年为一百计，出口价格从1955年11月到1956年下落了四十一，而同时期的进口价格则上升了十二。尤以去年苏伊士运河阻塞后，丹麦进口的固体和液体燃料上涨30％—40％。丹麦输入的燃料在1956年占总进口值的20％。从1956年对外贸易入超十四亿克朗中，有三亿克朗是由于进口货价格的上涨所致，其中燃料涨价占二亿五千万克朗。
    而丹麦主要农畜产品的出口价格则因西方市场对丹麦产品的容量缩小而惨跌。目前，鸡蛋价格在3月初下落到战后最低水平，较1956年下跌25％，猪肉下跌23％，牛油下跌28％。由于畜产品跌价引起了谷物也跌价。据估计如维持目前价格水平，1957年丹麦农产品的收入将减少七亿克朗，约合农产总值的10％以上，为农民收入的25％以上。
    以上这些因素，使丹麦对外贸易的情况恶化。
    1956年由于饲料丰收，活猪数目增加，1957年的猪肉产量估计可增10％。又因去冬气候温暖，鸡蛋也将增产10％。因此，丹麦各界人士深惧三十年代的农业危机会又要到来。由于大选在即，大农业资本家大肆渲染目前的农业危机，以打击社会民主党政府，同时纷纷要求：压低工资，降低生产成本；提高产品质量，增强竞争能力；紧缩农业生产，杀掉15％—20％的母猪；实行克朗贬值等等。社会民主党政府由于恐怕失去选票，尚未正式接受农业资本家的要求，而强调近年来丹麦工业出口的上升，主张吸收外国资本，大力发展丹麦的出口工业。丹麦在战后一直在发展出口工业，工业品在出口中所占比重不断增加，但是由于在丹麦竞争力较强的工业品，只有船只、五金用具，要扩大市场仍有不小困难。
