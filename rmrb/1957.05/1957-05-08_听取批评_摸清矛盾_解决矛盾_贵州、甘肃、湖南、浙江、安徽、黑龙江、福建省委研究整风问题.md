    Listening to Criticism, Ascertaining Contradictions, Resolving Contradictions
    Provincial Party Committees of Guizhou, Gansu, Hunan, Zhejiang, Anhui, Heilongjiang, and Fujian Study Rectification Issues
    (By our reporter) The provincial committees of the Chinese Communist Party in Guizhou, Gansu, Hunan, Zhejiang, Anhui, Heilongjiang, and other provinces have recently convened standing committee meetings or expanded standing committee meetings to study the issue of carrying out rectification movements in their respective provinces. The Fujian Provincial Committee also convened a meeting of the first secretaries of the district (city) and county party committees in Xiamen, Jinjiang, Longxi, and Longyan, and decided to immediately begin rectification movements in party organizations at the county level and above in these areas.
    The Guizhou Provincial Committee believes that in the rectification, the primary task is to earnestly help leading cadres overcome bureaucracy and expand democracy; it requires leading cadres to go deep into reality at the beginning of the rectification, understand the situation at lower levels, and help cadres improve their ideology and work style. In addition, it will invite non-party figures and workers, farmers, and student masses to hold forums at any time to solicit opinions.
    The Gansu Provincial Committee believes that the rectification process should be transformed into a process of transforming thinking and improving work efficiency. It has decided that from now until mid-June, leading comrades of the party and non-party members from seven work departments, including industry and transportation, agriculture and forestry, finance and trade, culture and education, propaganda, and political and legal affairs, and ethnic united front, will hold various forums to listen to criticism, ascertain the various contradictions existing in the work of each system, and correctly analyze and resolve these contradictions through rectification.
    The rectification study of the party organizations directly under the Hunan Provincial government is gradually unfolding. Some units have initially examined errors of bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism in their past work; however, some units lack enthusiasm for study, and the leading personnel of some units are busy with meetings and going to the countryside, which has weakened the leadership of the rectification study. Measures are now being taken to correct these shortcomings. Each unit will also hold forums or employee representative meetings in the near future to promote democracy and begin to resolve some of the initially revealed problems.
    The Heilongjiang Provincial Committee has initially proposed the issues that should be focused on checking and resolving in the rectification: In terms of opposing bureaucracy, it will focus on checking the lack of deep penetration of leadership into the grassroots, detachment from the masses, and insufficient democratic style; in terms of opposing sectarianism, it will focus on checking the lack of attention to and violation of the united front policy, lack of attention to the work of democratic parties, Great Han chauvinist tendencies in ethnic work, and the inability to cooperate and work with non-party members in the work of institutions and joint state-private enterprises; in terms of opposing subjectivism, it will focus on checking the subjective one-sidedness and dogmatic thinking in ideological methods.
    When studying the rectification movement, all provinces have studied the issue of leading cadres participating in production labor, believing that the participation of leading personnel in production labor is closely related to getting rid of bureaucratic work style. The Zhejiang Provincial Committee believes that the participation of leading personnel in physical labor is of great significance and has many benefits. First, it strengthens the relationship between the Party and the masses; second, it exercises and transforms oneself, cultivates labor concepts and labor habits; third, it changes the social atmosphere, changes the erroneous thinking of "those who labor with their minds govern others, and those who labor with their strength are governed by others," and makes the majority of cadres and masses value labor and establish the idea that labor is glorious. Now, leading organs are calling on the people and young students to participate in physical labor every day, and it is not convincing if they do not participate in physical labor themselves. Therefore, it is required that leaders at all levels take the lead and immediately participate in physical labor.

### 听取批评　摸清矛盾　解决矛盾  贵州、甘肃、湖南、浙江、安徽、黑龙江、福建省委研究整风问题

    听取批评　摸清矛盾　解决矛盾
    贵州、甘肃、湖南、浙江、安徽、黑龙江、福建省委研究整风问题
    本报讯　贵州、甘肃、湖南、浙江、安徽、黑龙江等省的中共省委，在最近都召开了常委会或常委扩大会，研究在本省开展整风运动的问题。福建省委并召开了厦门、晋江、龙溪和龙岩等地区地（市）、县委第一书记会议，决定在这些地区的县以上机关党组织中立即开始整风运动。
    贵州省委认为在整风中首先要认真帮助领导干部切实克服官僚主义，扩大民主；要求领导干部在整风开始的同时就要深入实际，了解下情，帮助干部改进思想和工作作风。此外，还将随时邀请党外人士以及工人、农民、学生群众座谈，征求意见。
    甘肃省委认为应该把整风过程变成为改造思想提高工作效率的过程，决定从现在起到下月中旬止，由工业交通、农林、财贸、文教、宣传、政法、民族统战等七个方面工作部门党内外负责同志，分别召开各种座谈会，听取批评，摸清各系统工作中存在的各种矛盾，通过整风，正确地分析和解决这些矛盾。
    湖南省直属机关党组织的整风学习正在逐步开展，有的单位已初步检查了过去工作中的官僚主义、宗派主义、主观主义等错误；但是有的单位学习劲头不大，有的单位领导人员忙于开会和下乡工作，减弱了对整风学习的领导，现在，正在采取措施纠正这些缺点。各单位还将分别在最近召开座谈会或职工代表会，发扬民主，着手解决一些初步揭露出来的问题。
    黑龙江省委已经初步提出在整风中要着重检查和解决的问题：在反对官僚主义方面，将着重检查领导不深入基层、脱离群众、民主作风不够等；在反对宗派主义方面，将着重检查不重视和违反统战政策、不重视民主党派工作、民族工作中的大汉族主义倾向、机关和公私合营企业工作中不善于和非党人士合作共事等；在反对主观主义方面，则将着重检查思想方法上的主观片面性和教条主义思想。
    各省在研究整风运动时，都研究了领导干部参加生产劳动的问题，认为领导人员参加生产劳动和摆脱官僚主义作风有密切关系。浙江省委认为：领导人员参加体力劳动，意义很大，好处很多。一是密切了党和群众的关系，二是锻炼自己，改造自己，培养劳动观念和劳动习惯，三是转变社会风气，转变“劳心者治人，劳力者治于人”的错误思想，使广大干部和群众重视劳动，树立劳动光荣的思想。现在，领导机关天天在号召人民、号召青年学生参加体力劳动，自己不去参加体力劳动是不能令人信服的。因此，要求各级领导人员以身作则，立即参加体力劳动。
