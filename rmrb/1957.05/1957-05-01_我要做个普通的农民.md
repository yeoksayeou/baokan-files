    I Want to Be an Ordinary Farmer
    Liu Xi
    It was one morning last July when my uncle saw me off from the village with a smile. He said, "Child, you must study hard. You're the first in the family to enter high school..." Every time I receive a letter from home, my uncle's words burn in my heart. I thought, I must make the villagers proud, and never be a farmer toiling all day long again. I was afraid that the hoe would wear out my hands, that sweat and soil would bury my youth, afraid of people pointing fingers and gossiping coldly behind my back:
  "After studying for more than ten years, he's still a useless farmer..." But when the aroma of golden millet rice wafts into my nostrils, I think of my father sweating in the fields. When I put on a new dress made of cotton cloth, I seem to see the old cotton-growing neighbor. Ah! Are my ancestors of low character? Can children look down on their hardworking fathers? I ask myself – in the quiet of the night, the shameful "contempt for farmers" gnaws at my heart! I savor my uncle's words again, and they don't mean for me to be someone detached from production, but to take back the culture that the working people have lost and return it to the countryside. I am willing to grab manure by the handful, to apply it to the fields so that they can bear thousands of fruits. I am willing to use the hand that holds the pen to grip the hoe, so that gold can be dug out from under the hoe. Dew is the best drink for seedlings, and it is also the nectar that makes my emotions healthy. The scorching sun, ah, it gives its heat to the crops to its heart's content, and also makes my sweat generously dedicated to the roots of the seedlings. I want to grow tens of millions of kilograms of grain with my own hands to supply the citizens, students, army, and workers... If someone asks me my first choice, I proudly say: I want to be an ordinary farmer.

    我要做个普通的农民
    刘玺那是去年七月的一个早晨，大伯笑着送我出村，他说：“孩子，你可要好好念啊，祖辈你头一个进了高中的大门……”每当我接到家乡的来信，大伯的那句话烧灼我的心。我想，我可得给乡亲们争口气，再不做终日劳累的农民。我怕锄杠磨坏了手，怕汗珠和泥土埋没青春，怕人们手指脊背冷水般议论：
  “念十几年书还是个没出息的农民……”但当那金黄的小米饭香气喷鼻，我想起田野里正落汗的父亲，当我穿上一件棉布裁成的新衣，我仿佛看见隔壁的种棉老人。啊！难道我的祖先人品低贱？难道儿女能瞧不起勤劳的父亲？我问自己——在静静的夜晚，可耻的“轻视农民”咬破了我的心！我再细嚼大伯那句话，也不是叫我做脱离生产的人，是让我把劳动人民失去的文化，重新取回它交给农村。我愿意一把一把地去抓粪，施到地里能结出千样果实，我愿意用正拿笔的手去握锄杠，锄头下能锄出来万两黄金。露水是禾苗最好的饮料，也是使我情感健康的甘霖，烈日啊，它把热力尽情送给作物，也使我的汗珠慷慨地献给苗根。我要亲手种出千万斤粮食，供应市民、学生、军队、工人……假如有人问我头一个志愿，我骄傲地说：我要做个普通的农民。
