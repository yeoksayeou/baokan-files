Poem from Jinmen Island
——Notes on the words of a KMT soldier who swam back to the mainland
Feng Weigang

In that impoverished era
I grazed cattle for the landlord by the Songhua River
The quiet river water reflected my face
Although my face was sallow, it still had the look of a child

In that war-torn era
I suffered serious injuries by the Yangtze River
The quiet river water reflected my face
Although my face was bloody, it still had the vigor of youth

Now, alas! I stay on Jinmen Island, bound by barbed wire
Every day I come to the beach to build bunkers
The quiet sea water reflects my face
Wrinkles line my face, and the beard under my nose is like a mountain
Grass…

Dream
I lie in the damp bunker
Every night I cannot fall asleep
Either my mother comes to my side
Or I jump into the tumbling ocean
The waves rush me north
My tense heart pressed against the waves
I hear gunshots behind me
Hot bullets pierce my chest…
My blood! Dyes the sea red
My body sinks to the bottom of the sea
The surging waves suddenly calm
Gleaming bayonets force me back again…
The failed dream! Always leaves me in a cold sweat
The terrible night always makes my tears run dry
I hope that multiple failures will leave me with experience
So that I can be safe on the night of the real crossing…

Recollection
Whenever I see the smoke rising from Xiaodeng Island
I cannot help but think of my kind mother
Whenever I carry an American gun to my post
Fiery past events burn in my chest…

Nine years ago, on a stormy night
The Latin team came to my village
Mother, in order to escort me away
An American bullet pierced her left hand
Mother bled profusely
I shed tears
In the rain of abuse and beatings
I lost my hometown, lost my mother…

Since then, I carried an American gun on my shoulder
Walking with heavy steps, listening to the insults of the officers
I passed through countless valleys
And finished walking the connected mainland
Now I am imprisoned on an island
Still holding this gun in my hand
Do they still want to make my mother lose her right hand?
Do they still want to see my mother's blood flow?

    来自金门岛的诗
    ——记一个泅水逃回大陆的蒋军士兵的话
    冯维刚脸在那贫穷的年代里我在松花江边给地主放牛静静的江水印出我的脸脸儿虽然枯黄，但它仍有孩子的模样在那战火纷飞的年代里我在扬子江边负了重伤静静的江水印出我的脸脸上虽有鲜血，但它仍有青年的气色现在呵！我呆在铁丝网捆绑的金门岛每天来到海边修筑地堡静静的海水印出我的脸脸上皱纹道连道，鼻下胡子如山
    草……
    梦我躺在潮湿的地堡里每夜每夜都不能入睡不是母亲来到我的身旁就是我跳进翻滚的海洋海浪把我驰向北方紧张的心儿贴着海浪猛听得身后连声枪响火辣的子弹穿进胸膛……我的血呀！染红了海水我的身子沉下海底汹涌澎湃的海浪猛然平息寒光闪闪的刺刀又把我逼回……失败的梦呀！总留我一头冷汗可怕的夜晚，总使我眼泪流干但愿多次失败，留给我经验真正渡海的晚上才能安全……
              忆每当我看到小登岛的炊烟升起不由地就想起慈祥的母亲每当我背着美国枪去上岗烈火般往事就烧着我的胸膛……
    九年前一个狂风暴雨的晚上
    拉丁队来到我乡
    母亲为了护送我逃走
    左手穿进一颗美国弹头
    母亲流着热血
    我流着热泪
    就在恶骂毒打的雨夜里
    失去了故乡，失去了母亲……
    从此我肩上掮了一支美国枪
    迈着沉重的步伐，听着长官的辱骂
    经过了无数的河谷
    走完了连心的大陆现在我被囚在监狱的岛上手中还拿着这支枪难道还想再使母亲失去右手难道还想再看到母亲的血流……
