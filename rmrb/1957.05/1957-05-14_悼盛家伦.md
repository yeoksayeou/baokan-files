    In Memoriam of Sheng Jialun
    Dear Jialun!
    We were unable to keep you, and we will never hear your eloquent voice again.
    For a long time, you covered your illness with a smile, answered others' lack of understanding with silence, and drowned your loneliness with books; you tried your best to satisfy friends who sought knowledge, because that was also your greatest joy.
    But can you die without regret? When your painstaking cultivation began to bear fruit, when you were just about to offer flowers, but you took the flowers with you!
          Dai Hao, Yu Feng, Wu Xiling, Tang Yu, Ge Yihong (Zhang Zhengyu's sketch) (with picture)

    悼盛家伦
    亲爱的家伦！
    我们没有能够留住你，再也听不见你雄辩的声音。
    长久以来，你用微笑遮盖着疾病，用沉默回答别人的不了解，用书籍淹没了孤独；你尽力使寻求知识的朋友得到满足，因为那也是你最大的欢乐。
    但是你能死无遗憾吗？当你那一点一滴的耕耘开始收获的时候，当你正准备献出花朵，而你却又带着花朵去了！
