Xinhua News Agency, May 22nd -- According to TASS reports: The Dzerzhinsky Metallurgical Plant in Dneprodzerzhinsk has, for the first time in the world, used vacuum equipment to remove harmful gases emitted during the Bessemer steelmaking process. As everyone knows, newly smelted steel mostly contains harmful gases. Among them, nitrogen can make steel brittle, while hydrogen can cause internal cracks in the steel. In order to eliminate these harmful gases, a group of experts at the Dzerzhinsky plant, under the leadership of Samarin, a corresponding academician of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, created a vacuum device with a vacuum degree of 0.15 atmospheres. After the molten steel is sent into it, the gas contained inside is continuously discharged, and the molten steel appears to boil. A single vacuum operation takes ten minutes, and each time it can process twenty-two tons of molten steel. After this process is completed, the steel with harmful gases removed can begin to be cast into ingots.

After the nitrogen and hydrogen are removed, the toughness of the steel is doubled compared to before, and the waste products caused by internal cracks are reduced by half. At the same time as removing harmful gases, non-metallic impurities are also removed, thus improving the quality of the steel.

    利用真空装置排除有害气体
    苏联一冶金厂首创提高钢质量方法
    新华社22日讯　据塔斯社报道：第聂伯罗捷尔任斯克的捷尔任斯基冶金工厂在世界上第一次利用真空装置排除贝氏炼钢时发出的有害气体。大家知道，初炼出的钢中大都含有有害的煤气。其中，氮会使钢变脆，而氢会使钢内部起裂纹。为了排除这些有害的气体，捷尔任斯基工厂的一批专家在苏联科学院通讯院士萨马林的领导下，创造了一种真空程度达到○·一五大气压的真空装置。出炉的钢水在送到里面去以后，内部所含的煤气就不断排出，这时钢水看来好像沸腾起来一样。进行一次真空作业工序需要十分钟，每次可以加工二十二吨钢水。这一道工序完成后，排除了有害气体的钢就可以开始铸锭。
    在排除了氮和氢以后，钢的韧性比原先提高了一倍，因内部裂纹而造成的废品减少了一半。在排除有害气体的同时，非金属的杂质也附带被排除出去，这样钢的质量也提高了。
