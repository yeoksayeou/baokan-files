Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 29th: Trường Chinh, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party, said yesterday afternoon at the Vietnam National Agricultural Labor Model and Work Exchange Team Cadre Conference that rural areas after land reform should take the road of mutual aid and cooperation.

He said that in rural areas after land reform, there will be two completely opposite development paths—namely, the capitalist road and the socialist road. The capitalist road will lead working farmers back to poverty. The Party must lead the peasants to advance together with the Party, taking the road of mutual aid and cooperation, which is the road to free and happy socialism.

The Vietnam National Agricultural Labor Model and Work Exchange Team Cadre Conference, which began on May 21, lasted a total of eight days. At yesterday's closing ceremony, a call to all farmers in the North was adopted, calling on farmers to work hard to launch a competition to realize the 1957 national plan.

President Ho Chi Minh addressed the conference the day before the closing ceremony.

Trường Chinh also stated at the meeting that Vietnam will continue to carry out land reform in mountainous areas in the future in order to completely overthrow Vietnam's feudal land ownership system.

Trường Chinh said that although land reform has been basically completed in nearly four thousand villages in the plains and midstream areas of the Red River in northern Vietnam, it has not yet been carried out in more than one thousand villages in mountainous areas. He pointed out that the methods of carrying out land reform in the mountainous areas inhabited by ethnic minorities will be different from those in the plains, and should be more suitable for the situation of ethnic minorities.

    长征在越南农业劳模大会上说
    越南农村要走互助合作的道路
    新华社河内29日电　越南劳动党中央政治局委员长征昨天下午在越南全国农业劳动模范和变工组干部大会上说，土地改革以后的农村应当走互助合作的道路。
    他说，土地改革以后的农村中将有两条完全相反的发展道路——即资本主义道路和社会主义道路。资本主义道路会把劳动农民重新带到贫困的境地。党要领导农民同党一起前进，走互助合作的道路，这条路是自由幸福的社会主义的道路。
    从5月21日开始的越南全国农业劳动模范和变工组干部大会一共开了八天。在昨天的闭幕会上通过了给全北方农民的号召书，号召农民努力展开竞赛，实现1957年国家计划。
    胡志明主席在大会闭幕的前一天，向大会讲了话。
    长征在会上还表示越南今后还要在山区进行土地改革，以便彻底推翻越南的封建土地所有制。
    长征说，土地改革虽然已经在越南北方的平原和红河中游地区的近四千个乡基本完成了，但是山区的一千多个乡还没有进行。他指出，在少数民族聚居的山区进行土地改革的方式将和平原地区有所不同，要更适合于少数民族的情况。
