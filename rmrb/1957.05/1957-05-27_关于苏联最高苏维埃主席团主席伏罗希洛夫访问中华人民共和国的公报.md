Xinhua News Agency, May 26th: Communiqué on the Visit of Kliment Voroshilov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, to the People's Republic of China.

At the invitation of Mao Zedong, Chairman of the People's Republic of China, Kliment Voroshilov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, paid a friendly visit to China from April 15 to May 6 and from May 24 to 26, 1957.

Accompanying Chairman Voroshilov on his visit were Rashidov, Deputy Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR and Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic; Yelyutin, Minister of Higher Education of the USSR; Fedrin, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the USSR; and Yudin, Soviet Ambassador to the People's Republic of China.

Chairman Voroshilov and his entourage visited Beijing, Anshan, Shenyang, Tianjin, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Guangzhou, Wuhan, and Kunming in China, and toured many enterprises and agricultural cooperatives. The Soviet guests also visited Chinese scientific institutions, schools, historical sites, and cultural attractions.

During their visit to China, the Soviet guests were warmly welcomed by the Chinese people. The meetings between the Soviet guests and the Chinese people strongly demonstrated the friendship between China and the Soviet Union, which the people of both countries consider one of their greatest achievements.

In these days, the world has once again witnessed the rock-solid unity and profound friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union. This unity and friendship are a favorable factor for our two countries in building socialism and communism, an important contribution to strengthening the unity of socialist countries, and a reliable guarantee for world peace and the cause of human progress.

During their visit to China, Chairman Voroshilov and his entourage met and held friendly talks with leaders of the CPC Central Committee and the Chinese government, as well as with staff members of provincial and municipal Party and government organs, workers, farmers, representatives of democratic parties, youth, and intellectuals.

They met and had cordial and heartfelt talks with Comrades Mao Zedong, Zhu De, Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Soong Ching Ling, Chen Yun, Deng Xiaoping, Peng Zhen, and other Chinese political and social activists. The talks touched upon various issues concerning relations between the two countries and the international situation. The meetings and talks were conducted in an atmosphere of cordiality and full mutual understanding.

These talks were based on a firm desire to further strengthen the fraternal friendly cooperation between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union and the unity of socialist countries.

The Soviet representatives witnessed the unity of the Chinese people, the Communist Party, and the government in China, and are convinced that the Chinese Communist Party enjoys high prestige and reputation among the people and is good at finding ways and methods of building socialism that are in line with China's specific practical conditions.

They had the opportunity to gain a general understanding of the development of China's industry, agriculture, culture, and education, as well as the profound socialist transformations that have been achieved in the era of the people's power.

Chairman Voroshilov's visit to China has made a great contribution not only to further strengthening and developing the friendly relations between the 800 million people of China and the Soviet Union but also to strengthening the cause of world peace.

Chairman Voroshilov invited Chairman Mao Zedong to visit the Soviet Union at a time he deemed appropriate. Chairman Mao Zedong gladly accepted this invitation. May 26, 1957
