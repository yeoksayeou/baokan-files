At Peking University's "Historical Issues Lecture Series"
	Egyptian Archaeologist Lectures on "Egyptology"

(Our dispatch) On the afternoon of May 20th, the History Department of Peking University held the fifth lecture in its History Issues Lecture Series. The lecture, on Egyptology, was given by the renowned Egyptian archaeologist, Mr. Aimer. Although the rectification movement is currently in full swing, the audience turnout was still very enthusiastic, with many senior scholars in attendance. Mr. Long Yun also attended the lecture with great interest.

Professor Aimer stated that Egyptology encompasses a wide range of disciplines, including Egyptian history, archaeology, ancient languages and writing, literature, art, and law. Just like Sinology, it should become an important component of world scholarship.

Next, Professor Aimer briefly introduced the development of Egyptology from the time Napoleon dispatched the first archaeological team to Egypt in 1798 to the present. He said that Egypt, like China, had suffered damage to its traditional culture in the past due to the oppression of colonialism and imperialism, but this era has now passed.

Professor Aimer then spoke about the purpose and methods of archaeological excavation. He believes that archaeological excavation in Egypt has three main purposes: (1) to verify Egypt's own history; (2) to investigate the history of various countries in West Asia that were influenced by Egypt in ancient times; and (3) to investigate the relationship between Egyptian culture and modern European civilization. He also suggested that archaeological excavations in China should also aim at these three points: Chinese history, the history of China's neighboring countries, and Sino-Western relations.

In the third part of Professor Aimer's lecture, he first explained the simple process of ancient Egyptian history. He believes that Egyptian history from 3300 BC to 332 BC was an active period, a period when the Egyptians managed themselves. From 332 BC, when Macedonian Alexander conquered Egypt, until 1952, was a passive period, a period under foreign rule. However, from 1952 onwards, Egyptian history has once again embarked on an active period. Professor Aimer then introduced the achievements of ancient Egypt in art, literature, law, science, and other fields, using rich and vivid examples to comprehensively depict the glorious contributions of ancient Egypt to human culture.

At the end of the lecture, Professor Aimer answered questions from the audience and expressed his views on the periodization of Chinese history, which aroused great interest among the audience. Professor Aimer also said that cultural exchanges between China and Egypt have been hampered in the past due to certain human factors. He believes that under the leadership of the two governments, this exchange will be greatly strengthened in the future.

    在北大“历史问题讲座”上
    埃及考古学家主讲“埃及学”
    本报讯　5月20日下午，北大历史系举办的历史问题讲座第五讲，由埃及著名考古学家艾米尔讲演了埃及学。虽然在热烈整风运动中，到会听众仍十分踊跃，并且有很多老先生参加，龙云先生也以很大的兴趣参加了听讲。
    艾米尔教授说：埃及学包括埃及的历史、考古及古代语言文字、文学艺术及法律等广泛的各方面的学问，它正如汉学一样，应该成为世界学术的一个重要组成部分。
    其次，艾米尔教授简单介绍了自1798年拿破仑派遣第一个考古队到埃及起直到现在的埃及学的发展经过。他说，埃及也正如中国一样，过去由于殖民主义和帝国主义的压迫，在研究自己的传统文化上受到了损害，但是现在这个时代已经过去了。
    艾米尔教授然后讲了考古发掘的目的和方法。他认为，在埃及的考古发掘，有着三个主要的目的：（一）考证埃及自己的历史；（二）考查古代时受埃及影响的西亚各国的历史；（三）考查埃及文化和近代欧洲文明的关系。他并且建议中国的考古发掘，也应以这三点——中国的历史，中国近邻诸国的历史，中西关系——为目的。
    在艾米尔教授的第三部分讲演中，首先说明了古代埃及历史的简单过程。他认为埃及的历史由公元前三三零零年到公元前三三二年，是主动（积极）时期，这是埃及人自己管理自己的时期。由公元前三三二年马其顿亚历山大征服埃及起直到公元1952年，是被动（消极）时期，是受外国人统治的时期。但从1952年起，埃及的历史又走上了主动时期。艾米尔教授在下面并且介绍了古埃及的艺术、文学、法律、科学等各方面的成就。用丰富生动的例子，全面地描绘了古代埃及对人类文化的光辉贡献。
    在讲演的最后，艾米尔教授又回答了听众所提出的问题，对中国的历史分期问题表示了自己的看法，引起听众很大的兴趣。艾米尔教授还说，中埃两国的文化交流，过去由于一些人为的原因，受到了阻碍，他相信今后在两国政府的领导下这种交流会大大地加强起来。
