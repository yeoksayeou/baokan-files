Comrades,

Discussing and adopting the Constitution of the Chinese Communist Youth League is an important item on the agenda of this conference. The new Constitution (Draft) submitted to the conference for discussion is based on the current Constitution, drawing on the experience of the League's construction over the past few years, and formulated in accordance with the new tasks and new requirements put forward by the new situation. Before being submitted to the conference, this draft was distributed to League committees at the county level and above and some grassroots League organizations for discussion, and it absorbed many good opinions put forward by comrades from various regions. Now, entrusted by the Second Central Committee of the League, I will make the following explanation of the Constitution (Draft) of the Chinese Communist Youth League.

(I)

The general program part of the new Constitution (Draft) has been significantly expanded in content and has undergone some important revisions compared to the current Constitution.

The first important difference between the new Constitution (Draft) and the current Constitution is the change in the name of the League, that is, changing the China New Democratic Youth League to the Chinese Communist Youth League. As everyone knows, the situation and tasks we are now facing are not only fundamentally different from those at the beginning of the League's establishment in 1949, but have also undergone tremendous changes compared to the time of the League's Second National Congress. In 1949, when our Youth League began to be established, the Chinese people, under the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party, were waging the final decisive battle against the Kuomintang reactionaries. The People's Republic of China had not yet been founded. At that time, the task stipulated in the League Constitution was "to fight for the complete overthrow of the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism in China, for the construction of an independent, peaceful, democratic, prosperous, and unified People's Republic of China, and for the complete victory of the New Democracy." At that time, it was in line with the struggle tasks and the level of awareness of the broad masses of young people to name our League the China New Democratic Youth League. By the time of the League's Second National Congress in 1953, China's democratic reforms had been completed, and the Party had put forward the tasks of socialist transformation and socialist construction to the people of the whole country. Due to the changes in the situation, the League Constitution was revised, stipulating that the task of the Youth League was "to strive for the gradual realization of national industrialization and the gradual transition to a socialist society." Now, we can proudly say that the youth of our country, together with the people of our country, have achieved a decisive victory in the socialist revolution. The most progressive social system in human history—the socialist system—has been established in our country. In just eight years, the youth of our country, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, have undergone the training of two revolutionary struggles, and their mental outlook has undergone significant changes, and their socialist consciousness has been greatly improved. The youth of our country are working diligently to build our great motherland into a socialist industrial power, and regard further realization of communism as their lofty ideal. The China New Democratic Youth League has completed its historical mission. Obviously, under such circumstances, it is no longer appropriate to continue to call our League the China New Democratic Youth League. We should change the name of the League to the Chinese Communist Youth League in accordance with the ardent wishes of the broad masses of League members and young people.

The change of the League's name marks that the Chinese youth movement has entered a new historical period. As Comrade Deng Xiaoping said on behalf of the Party Central Committee when giving instructions to the conference, it "not only brings great glory to all League members, but also places more arduous tasks on the shoulders of Chinese youth." The Party and the people have higher demands on the Youth League than in the past. Our future goal is, as stipulated in the new Constitution (Draft), to "strive for the building of socialism and the realization of communism in the future"; and "labor, learning, and unity" are our slogans. These are fully reflected in the new Constitution (Draft). The new Constitution (Draft) clearly stipulates that the Youth League "is a school for learning communism," and particularly emphasizes that the Youth League should educate young people with the spirit of communism, help them continuously improve their ideological awareness, inherit and carry forward the revolutionary traditions of the people of our country, and make the younger generation of our country builders of socialism who love the motherland, are loyal to the people, are knowledgeable, abide by discipline, are physically strong, are diligent, brave, and vigorous, and are not afraid of any difficulties; it emphasizes that the Youth League should carry out labor education among the broad masses of young people, educate young people to love labor, respect working people, actively participate in industrial and agricultural production and various construction undertakings, and strive to learn labor skills and cultural and scientific knowledge for building the motherland, and oppose the erroneous view of despising labor, especially physical labor; it emphasizes strengthening friendship and unity with young people of all nationalities across the country, being good at cooperating closely with various youth organizations, learning from each other, and making progress together, and always being vigilant and overcoming the sectarian tendency of arrogance, complacency, and detachment from the masses; it emphasizes adhering to the mass line in all work and carrying out independent activities that are beneficial to socialist construction and promote the healthy growth of young people. All of the above have been elaborated in detail in the work report made by Comrade Hu Yaobang to the conference on behalf of the Second Central Committee, so I will not make more explanations here.

The current League Constitution states that the Youth League is the Party's assistant and reserve force, while the new Constitution (Draft) only states that the Youth League is the Party's assistant. This is because the role of assistant actually includes the role of reserve force. The so-called role of assistant refers to the fact that the Youth League must support the Party's program and become an active propagandist and executor of the Party's policies and resolutions in all aspects of our country's socialist construction; it refers to the fact that the Youth League must give the Party strong assistance in the struggle to develop production, improve work, and expose and eliminate shortcomings and errors in work; it refers to the fact that the Youth League must assist the Party in educating young people with the spirit of communism, uniting the broad masses of young people more closely around the Party, so that the younger generation of our country can better become successors to the revolutionary cause led by our Party, and so that some League members and young people can gradually reach the level of awareness of Party members and be admitted into the Party ranks. Because of these reasons, and also in order to avoid the misunderstanding that all League members must join the Party by writing that the League is the Party's reserve force—while in fact, it is impossible for all Youth League members to join the Party—the new Constitution (Draft) no longer states that the League is the Party's reserve force.

(II)

The new Constitution (Draft) has made many important revisions and supplements to the chapter on League members.

First, in the article on who can join the League, the mention of young workers, young peasants, young soldiers, educated youth, and other working youth in the current League Constitution has been deleted, and it is clearly stipulated that only working youth can join the Chinese Communist Youth League. This is because, due to the great victory of socialist transformation, the class relations in our country have undergone fundamental changes, and now almost all young people in our country have participated in labor or are studying in schools preparing to participate in labor. Moreover, in the past few years, when we have developed League members, there have been no different requirements for the admission procedures of the above-mentioned types of youth. At the same time, such a statement can more significantly show that League members and young people striving to join the League must firmly draw a line between labor and exploitation ideologically, and the Communist Youth League cannot allow exploiters or people with exploitative behavior to participate in its ranks.

The new Constitution (Draft) changes the minimum age for receiving young people into the League from fourteen to fifteen years old. This is because, in terms of the age, requirements, interests, and hobbies of fourteen-year-old teenagers, the activities and educational methods of the Young Pioneers are more suitable for them. Moreover, since the establishment of the League, there have been very few facts of fourteen-year-old teenagers joining the Youth League.

Second, the new Constitution (Draft) cancels the provision in which Communist Party members and Chinese Young Pioneers troop committee are the introducers when youths join the League. This is mainly because League organizations have been widely established throughout the country. Wherever there are Party organizations and Young Pioneers organizations, there are also League organizations. The introducer for youths joining the League can now be completely served by League members. Of course, it must be pointed out that the past regulations played a positive and important role in developing the League's organization and building the League's ranks. In the early days of the League's establishment, many places did not have Youth League organizations, and the development of League members relied primarily on Party organizations sending some Party members to carry it out. As for the Young Pioneers organization, as a result of its many efforts among the broad masses of teenagers, it has created or increased favorable conditions for the development of the Youth League's organization. However, experience has shown that it is not appropriate for the Young Pioneers organization to serve as the introducer for members to join the League.

Third, the new Constitution (Draft) stipulates: "League members who reach the age of twenty-five and have not been elected to the League's leading organs or have not held specialized positions within the League will no longer retain their League membership; if they request to continue to stay in the League, they can retain their League membership until the age of twenty-eight." This regulation differs from the current League Constitution in that: 1. "League members who reach the age of twenty-five and have not been elected to the League's leading organs or have not held specialized positions within the League will no longer retain their League membership"; while the past only stipulated: "League members over the age of twenty-five who wish to withdraw from the League may declare their withdrawal to the branch committee." 2. Over-age League members "can retain their League membership until the age of twenty-eight if they request to continue to stay in the League"; while in the past there was no upper age limit. Why is such a change being made? This is because the Youth League is an organization with age limits. If over-age League members all stay in the League for a long time, then after a few years, the Youth League may become not a youth organization, or not entirely a youth organization. At the same time, all activities and education of the League organization are mainly aimed at the youth masses and are carried out according to the characteristics of the youth, but for over-age League members, when they enter adulthood, their requirements, interests, and hobbies will gradually differ from those of young people, so the League's activities will not be very suitable for their requirements. According to the materials mastered by the Organization Department of the League Central Committee, there are currently about 2.8 million over-age League members across the country, of which about one million are over the age of twenty-eight. This is a very large number, and in the future, there will be even more over-age League members each year than in the past. These over-age League members have generally made considerable progress in their ideology, politics, and work ability through the League's training and education, and they have made many achievements in various tasks inside and outside the League. In the future, they will play a greater active role in social and national life. When they leave the Youth League organization, the League organization should point out their progress and achievements in the League organization, humbly listen to their criticisms and suggestions, put forward hopes for their future, and patiently help them dispel some ideological concerns. At the same time, because they have a deep affection for the League organization and are more familiar with the work of the League, even after they leave the League, the League organization should always pay attention to maintaining contact with them; if they are still willing to participate in some activities of the League, participate in League meetings, listen to reports held by the League, etc., the League organization should welcome them and meet their requirements as much as possible. Some comrades asked whether all League members over the age of twenty-eight should immediately leave the League organization after the new Constitution (Draft) is promulgated. No, it should not be understood that way. The correct approach should be to first convey and explain the regulations on over-age League members universally and deeply within the League, so that all over-age League members and general League members can have a correct understanding of it, so that over-age League members can truly agree with this regulation ideologically after full consideration, and must not act simply, act hastily, and hurt their feelings for the League organization. Some comrades also suggested that a Communist Youth League commemorative certificate should be issued to over-age League members when they leave the League. We believe that this opinion is important and suggest that the Third Central Committee give it serious consideration.

In addition, the new Constitution (Draft) no longer makes separate provisions on their rights in League life in the article on over-age League members. What does this mean? This means that League members over the age of twenty-five, before leaving the League organization, regardless of whether they have been elected to the League's leading organs, still, like general League members, not only have to fulfill the obligations that League members should fulfill, but also enjoy the rights that League members should enjoy, and not only have the right to be elected, but also have the right to vote and the right to express opinions. This is more reasonable than the provisions of the current League Constitution, and it is beneficial to fully exert the enthusiasm of over-age League members.

Fourth, the new Constitution (Draft) stipulates that "League members will no longer retain their League membership after being admitted into the Party and becoming full Party members, if they do not hold leadership positions or specialized positions in the League." This is mainly because these League members can receive more complete education in the Party than in the League after joining the Party; they are already living the organizational life of the Party, and continuing to live the organizational life of the League will become an unnecessary repetition. As for League members who have been accepted as probationary Party members, if they still wish to retain their League membership during the probationary period, the League organization may allow them to retain it.

Fifth, the new Constitution (Draft) cancels the provisions on punishments for League organizations and cancels the disciplinary action of admonition for League members. This is because: 1. Punishments for organizations can be completely replaced by punishments for League members and League cadres. 2. Criticism and education of League members who have made minor mistakes is actually a kind of admonition, and it is inappropriate to regard admonition as a punishment for League members.

Although the new Constitution (Draft) stipulates the articles on punishments, we should understand that punishment is not our goal, but only a means of educating League members who have made mistakes, which is adopted when it is unavoidable. Young people are in a period of growth, and it is impossible for them not to make mistakes. Moreover, in general, they make mistakes mostly due to insufficient knowledge, lack of experience, and ideological deviations. Therefore, the correct attitude towards League members who have made mistakes should be to help them correct their mistakes seriously and conscientiously, and to protect their enthusiasm for the revolutionary cause from being damaged; as long as they can recognize and are willing to correct their mistakes, they should not be easily punished. Even for those comrades whose mistakes are serious and should be punished, attention should be paid to fully listening to their opinions and protecting their legitimate right to defend themselves when giving punishment. Doing so can not only avoid mistakes in punishment, but also enable the punished comrades to receive more education. For comrades who have already been punished, attention should also be paid to helping them and giving them necessary encouragement after the punishment, and welcoming every progress they make, even if it is a small progress.

(III)

Democratic centralism is the basic organizational principle of the League. Democracy and centralism are inseparable, but for the Youth League, more emphasis should be placed on developing democracy. This is because the Youth League is a mass organization of young people, and the masters of the Youth League organization are all Youth League members. Only by fully developing democracy can we better give play to the enthusiasm and creativity of each League member and enhance their sense of responsibility as masters in the League's life. Only by fully developing democracy can we better concentrate the wisdom of the masses, make the work of the League's leading organs more in line with the actual situation, fully reflect the requirements and wishes of the broad masses of young people, and better closely link the upper and lower levels, and closely link the League organization with the broad masses of League members and young people. At the same time, only by fully developing democracy can we better achieve the goal of educating League members and gradually cultivate their ability to think independently and their democratic style in democratic life.

It should be said that most of our League organizations pay attention to developing democracy within the League, and our democratic life within the League is generally normal. However, this does not mean that there are no problems in our democratic life within the League. We still have many shortcomings in this regard, and phenomena that violate democracy and undermine democratic principles are not very individual. First of all, there are many shortcomings in the leadership of the League Central Committee. The Third National Congress of the League was delayed by one year, and the plenary sessions of the Central Committee were also held less frequently. During this period, although the League Central Committee also held many working meetings to discuss and study many important issues in the League's work, these meetings could not replace the role of the plenary sessions of the Central Committee after all. The collective leadership of the Standing Committee of the League Central Committee is also unsound. There is a lack of due attention and serious research on some opinions and requirements from below, and the decisions on some issues still appear hasty and lack full deliberation and discussion. The requirements for some things also seem too rigid, and the different situations in various places have not been fully taken into account. It should be said that similar situations exist to varying degrees in many League organizations below the provincial and municipal levels. Many League county and district committees often cannot hold meetings for a long time. On the one hand, this is due to some objective difficulties, but subjectively, insufficient attention to strengthening the collective leadership of the League is still a very important reason. In addition, some League organizations only require League members to fulfill their obligations and do not pay much attention to guaranteeing the democratic rights of League members and lower-level organizations. They do not pay much attention to fully developing democracy in elections; they lack serious handling of appeals, criticisms, and suggestions from below. There are also individual League leading cadres who rudely adopt methods of suppression and retaliation against those who hold different opinions from themselves or who criticize the leadership. Obviously, these attitudes and practices are very wrong and must be given sufficient vigilance and overcome seriously.

In response to the above situation and based on the experience of the League's construction in the past few years, the new Constitution (Draft) has added the following provisions on expanding democracy within the League:

First, it stipulates that League members "may reserve or submit their own opinions to the League's leading organs if they disagree with the League's resolutions, in addition to unconditionally implementing them." It stipulates that League members have the right to "participate in the meetings of the League's organization to pass resolutions on their own punishment and may defend themselves."

Second, it stipulates that "organizations at all levels must fully develop democracy, effectively guarantee the democratic rights of League members, enable them to freely and effectively discuss the work of the League and various issues in the League's organization, and fully exert their enthusiasm and creativity"; "leading organs at all levels should often listen to and seriously handle the opinions of lower-level organizations and League members"; "organizations at all levels must often use the method of criticism and self-criticism to expose and eliminate shortcomings and errors in work. It is necessary to encourage criticism from below, especially to encourage League members and young people to make frank criticisms and suggestions to the League's leading organs and staff; oppose any act of suppressing criticism."

Third, it expands the powers of the National Congress, stipulating that the National Congress not only has the right to discuss major issues within the League, but also has the right to remove the duties of one-seventh of the total number of Central Committee members and alternate Central Committee members, and has the right to elect one-seventh of the total number of alternate Central Committee members.

Fourth, it stipulates that "the plenary sessions of the committees of provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the Central Government, and autonomous prefectures shall be held at least twice a year. The plenary sessions of the committees of counties, autonomous counties, and cities shall be held at least three times a year."

Fifth, it stipulates that "League organizations at all levels implement a system that combines collective leadership with individual responsibility."

It is certain that these provisions will bring great benefits to guaranteeing the democratic rights of League members and lower-level League organizations, strengthening the League's collective leadership, and improving and developing democratic life within the League. At the same time, it will also be conducive to strengthening centralism within the League. Our Youth League is a fighting force of advanced youth. We emphasize democracy precisely in order to more effectively achieve unity in politics and organization, thereby strengthening the League's combat effectiveness.

During the discussion of the Constitution (Draft), some comrades asked, since we want to expand democracy within the League, why should we change the National Congress from being held once every three years to once every four years? Some comrades asked why we do not implement a permanent system for representatives of all levels of Congress within the League?

We believe that changing the convening of the National Congress from once every three years to once every four years is to make it possible to connect it in time with the Congress of provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the Central Government, and autonomous prefectures, which is held once every two years. This not only facilitates the work of electing representatives to attend the National Congress, but also provides many conveniences for the arrangement of work between the Central and local levels. At the same time, since the powers of the National Congress have been expanded, as long as we can strive to hold a National Congress every year or so in the future, then, on the whole, democracy within the League will not be harmed by extending the time for convening the National Congress by one year.

As for the permanent system, it is indeed a very important measure to expand democracy within the Party for our Party. But for our Youth League, there are different situations, because the cadres of the Youth League flow faster, and also because the Youth League is an organization with age limits, it is difficult to require all or most of the representatives of the National Congress to be able to be re-elected for four years. In this way, if many representatives have been transferred from the work of the Youth League or have left the League organization due to "over-age" in the middle of the four years, then is the so-called permanent system not "nominal"? For the same reason, the permanent system is not very suitable for local congresses at all levels. Some comrades asked why it is stipulated that the National Congress has the right to remove some Central Committee members and alternate Central Committee members and elect some alternate Central Committee members? We believe that doing so, in addition to strengthening the supervision of the work of the League Central Committee and each Central Committee member by the entire League, is also because some of the League Central Committee members are often transferred from the work of the Youth League in the middle of the four-year term, and other comrades have to be elected to fill the vacancies.

Comrades, what I want to explain about the new Constitution (Draft) is these things. Everyone can see very clearly that, compared with the current League Constitution, it does not involve a change in the fundamental nature of the League, that is, it does not change that the Youth League is a mass organization of advanced youth under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and is the Party's assistant; it does not change that it is a school that educates youth with communist ideology; it does not change that the League's organization is built on the principle of democratic centralism. However, it does have some major revisions of a principled nature. These changes require us to raise the construction of the League to a higher level in order to better adapt to the requirements of the Party and the people, adapt to the requirements of the youth, and better exert its vanguard role and assault role among the broad masses of young people and in socialist construction.

We believe that with the kind leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, with the support and help of the older generation and all aspects of society, and with the work guidelines, tasks, and League Constitution formulated by this conference, relying on the efforts of the entire League, and through more arduous, deeper, and more detailed work, in the future, we will surely build the League's ranks better, better unite the youth of all nationalities in our country around the Party, make contributions to the motherland, and make greater contributions to socialist construction and the most noble cause of mankind—the cause of communism.

Comrades, as I conclude my report, I propose that our conference adopt the League Constitution (Draft) submitted to the conference for discussion as the Constitution of the Chinese Communist Youth League.

    关于中国共产主义青年团章程（草案）的报告
                                罗毅同志们：
    讨论和通过中国共产主义青年团的章程，是我们这次大会的一个重要议程。提交大会讨论的新的团章（草案），是以现行团章为基础、吸取了几年来团的建设的经验、根据新的形势所提出来的新的任务和新的要求而拟定的。这个草案在提交大会之前，曾经发给全国县级以上团委和部分团的基层组织进行了讨论，并且吸收了各地同志所提出的许多好的意见。现在，我受第二届团中央委员会的委托，对中国共产主义青年团章程（草案）作以下说明。	（一）
    新的团章（草案）总则部分，比起现行团章在内容上有了不少的扩充和一些重要的修改。
    新的团章（草案）和现行团章第一个重要的区别，就是团的名称的改变，即把中国新民主主义青年团改为中国共产主义青年团。正像大家所了解的，我们现在所面临的形势和任务，不仅和1949年开始建团的时候有了根本的不同，而且也和团的第二次全国代表大会的时候有了巨大的变化。1949年当我们青年团开始建立的时候，我国人民正在伟大的中国共产党的领导下，同国民党反动派进行着最后的决战，中华人民共和国还没有成立，当时，团章上规定的青年团的任务是“为彻底推翻帝国主义、封建主义与官僚资本主义在中国的统治，为独立、和平、民主、富强、统一的中华人民民主共和国的建设与新民主主义的彻底胜利而奋斗”。那时，把我们团的名称定为中国新民主主义青年团，是合乎当时的斗争任务和广大青年的觉悟水平的。到1953年举行团的第二次全国代表大会的时候，我国民主改革已经完成，党向全国人民提出了社会主义改造和社会主义建设的任务。由于形势的变化，修改了团章，规定青年团的任务是 “为逐步实现国家工业化和逐步过渡到社会主义社会而奋斗”。现在，我们可以自豪地说：我国青年和我国人民一道，已经取得了社会主义革命的决定性的胜利。人类历史上最进步的社会制度——社会主义制度在我国已经建立起来了。在短短的八年中，我国青年在中国共产党的领导下，经过了两次革命斗争的锻炼，精神面貌已经有了显著的变化，社会主义觉悟大大地提高了。我国青年正在为把我们伟大的祖国建设成为一个社会主义的工业强国而辛勤地劳动着，并且把进一步实现共产主义当作自己的崇高的理想。中国新民主主义青年团已经完成了自己的历史任务。很显然，在这种情况下，再把我们团的名称继续叫作中国新民主主义青年团，已经不合适了。我们应当根据广大团员和青年的热烈愿望，把团的名称改为中国共产主义青年团。
    改变团的名称，标志着中国青年运动已经进入一个新的历史时期。正如邓小平同志代表党中央向大会作指示时所说的那样，它“不只是给全体青年团员带来了巨大的光荣，而且，也在中国青年的肩上放上了更为繁重的任务”，党和人民对于青年团的要求比过去是更高了。今后我们的奋斗目标，就是新的团章（草案）所规定的，要为“建成社会主义和在将来实现共产主义而奋斗”；而“劳动、学习、团结”就是我们的行动口号。这些都在新的团章（草案）中有了充分的反映。新的团章（草案）明确地规定了青年团“是学习共产主义的学校”，特别强调了青年团要以共产主义精神教育青年，帮助他们不断地提高思想觉悟，继承和发扬我国人民的革命传统，使我国青年一代成为热爱祖国、忠于人民、有知识、守纪律、体魄健壮、勤劳勇敢、朝气蓬勃、不怕任何困难的社会主义的建设者；强调了青年团要在广大青年中进行劳动教育，教育青年热爱劳动，尊重劳动人民，积极参加工业、农业的生产和各项建设事业，努力学习建设祖国的劳动技能和文化、科学知识，反对轻视劳动特别是轻视体力劳动的错误观点；强调了要加强同全国各民族青年的友爱和团结，要善于同各个青年组织密切合作，互相学习，共同进步，经常警惕和克服骄傲自满、脱离群众的宗派主义倾向；强调了要在一切工作中坚持群众路线，开展有益于社会主义建设和促进青年健康成长的独立活动。以上这些，在胡耀邦同志代表二届中央委员会向大会所作的工作报告中已经有了详细的阐述，我在这里就不再作更多的说明了。
    在现行团章里写着青年团是党的助手和后备军，而新的团章（草案）则只写着青年团是党的助手。这是因为，助手作用实际上也包括了后备军的作用。所谓助手作用，指的是，青年团要拥护党的纲领，在我们国家社会主义建设的各个方面都要成为党的政策和决议的积极宣传者和执行者；指的是，在发展生产、改进工作、揭露和消除工作中的缺点和错误的斗争中，青年团要给党以有力的帮助；指的是，青年团要协助党以共产主义精神教育青年，把广大青年更紧密地团结在党的周围，使我国青年一代能够更好地成为我们党所领导的革命事业的接班人，并且使一部分团员和青年能够逐步地达到党员的觉悟水平，被接收到党的队伍中去。由于这些，同时也为了避免写上团是党的后备军，有可能被误解为所有的团员都要加入党，而事实上，青年团员要全部入党是不可能的，所以在新的团章（草案）中就没有再写上团是党的后备军了。	（二）
    新的团章（草案）对于团员的一章有了不少重要的修改和补充。
    第一，在什么人可以入团的条文中，删去了现行团章中关于青年工人、青年农民、青年军人、知识青年及其他劳动青年的提法，明确地规定只有劳动青年才能加入中国共产主义青年团。这是因为，由于社会主义改造的伟大胜利，我国的阶级关系已经发生根本变化，现在我国青年几乎全部已经参加劳动或者正在学校中学习准备参加劳动。而且，过去几年，我们在发展团员的时候，对于上述几种青年的入团手续，事实上并没有什么不同的要求。同时，这样的提法可以更显著地表明团员和争取入团的青年必须从思想上坚决地划清劳动和剥削之间的界限，共产主义青年团不能容许剥削分子或者有剥削行为的人参加自己的队伍。
    新的团章（草案）把接收青年入团的最低年龄由十四周岁改为十五周岁。这是因为，就十四周岁少年的年龄、要求、兴趣和爱好来说，少先队的活动内容和教育方法，对他们是比较更适合些。而且，建团以来，十四周岁的少年加入青年团的事实上也是很少的。
    第二，新的团章（草案）取消了中国共产党党员和中国少年先锋队中队委员会作青年入团的介绍人的规定。这主要是由于在全国范围内已经普遍建立了团的组织，凡是有党组织和少先队组织的地方，也都有了团的组织，青年入团的介绍人已经完全可以由团员来担任。当然，必须指出，过去那样的规定，对于发展团的组织、建设团的队伍是起过积极的、重要的作用的。在建团初期，许多地方还没有青年团的组织，发展团员首先就是依靠党组织派了一些党员去进行的。至于说到少先队组织，由于它在广大少年中进行了许多工作的结果，它为青年团的组织的发展创造了或者说增加了有利的条件。但是，经验证明，如果由少先队组织做队员入团的介绍人，并不是适宜的。
    第三，新的团章（草案）规定：“团员年满二十五周岁，没有被选入团的领导机关，或者没有担任团内的专门职务，就不再保留团籍；如果他们要求继续留在团内，可以保留团籍到二十八周岁。”这个规定比起现行团章来，它的不同之点是：⒈“团员年满二十五周岁，没有被选入团的领导机关，或者没有担任团内的专门职务，就不再保留团籍”；而过去只规定：“超过二十五周岁的团员，凡愿退团者，得向支部委员会声明退团。”⒉超龄团员“如果他们要求继续留在团内，可以保留团籍到二十八周岁”；而过去则没有最高年龄的限制。为什么要作出这样的改变呢？这是因为，青年团是一个有年龄限制的组织，如果超龄团员都长期留在团内，那末若干年以后，青年团就可能变成不是一个青年组织，或者不完全是一个青年组织了。同时，团组织的一切活动、教育主要是面向青年群众，是按照青年的特点进行的，而就超龄团员来说，当他进入成年时期，他的要求、兴趣和爱好就会逐渐地和青年人有所不同，这样，团的活动也就会不大适合于他的要求了。根据团中央组织部所掌握的材料，目前全国已经有超龄团员二百八十万左右，其中超过二十八周岁的约有一百万人。这是一个很不小的数字，而且今后每年超龄的团员比过去还会有更多的增加。这些超龄团员经过团的培养教育，在思想上、政治上和工作能力上一般的都有了不少提高，他们在团内外各项工作中都做出了不少成绩。今后他们在社会上和国家生活中还将会发生更大的积极作用。当他们离开青年团组织的时候，团的组织应该指出他们在团组织内的进步和成绩，虚心听取他们的批评和建议，提出对他们今后的希望，并且耐心地帮助他们解除思想上的一些顾虑。同时，由于他们对团的组织已经有了很深的感情，对团的工作比较熟悉，
    因此即使在他们离开团以后，团的组织还应该经常注意保持和他们的联系；如果他们还愿意参加团的一些活动，参加团的会议，听团举办的报告等，团的组织都应该欢迎他们，尽可能地满足他们的要求。有的同志问，新的团章（草案）公布以后，是不是所有超过二十八周岁的团员都要立即离开团的组织呢？不是的，不能够作这样的理解。正确的做法应该是，把对超龄团员的规定先在团内作普遍的、深入的传达解释，使所有的超龄团员和一般团员都能够对它有一个正确的了解，使超龄团员同志经过充分考虑，真正从思想上赞同这个规定，而决不可简单从事，操之过急，伤害他们对团组织的感情。也有的同志提出，在超龄团员离开团的时候发给他们共产主义青年团纪念证。我们认为这个意见是重要的，建议三届中央委员会予以认真考虑。
    另外，新的团章（草案）在有关超龄团员的条文中，没有再就他们在团内生活中的权利作出单独的规定。这意味着什么呢？这意味着，超过二十五周岁的团员，在没有离开团的组织以前，不管有没有被选入团的领导机关，仍然和一般团员一样，不仅要履行团员应尽的义务，同时享有团员应享有的权利，不仅有被选举权，而且有选举权和表决权。这比起现行团章的规定要更合理些，对于充分发挥超龄团员的积极性，是有好处的。
    第四，新的团章（草案）规定了“团员在被接收入党并且转为正式党员以后，如果没有在团内担任领导工作和专门职务，就不再保留团籍。”这主要是因为，这些团员在入了党以后，在党内可以受到比团内更为充分的教育；他们已经在过着党的组织生活，再继续过团的组织生活，就会变成一种不大必要的重复了。至于被接收为预备党员的团员，如果他们在预备期间，还愿意保留团籍，团的组织可以允许他们保留。
    第五，新的团章（草案）取消了对于团组织的处分的规定，取消了对团员的劝告处分。这是因为，⒈对于组织的处分完全可以由对于团员和团的干部的处分来代替。⒉对于犯有轻微错误的团员的批评教育，实际上就是一种劝告，把劝告当作对团员的一种处分是不适当的。
    新的团章（草案）虽然规定了关于处分的条文，但是我们应该了解，处分并不是我们的目的，而只是在不得已时才采用的，对于犯错误的团员进行教育的一种手段。青年人正处在成长时期，要他们不犯错误是不可能的。而且在一般的情况下，他们犯错误也多是由于知识不足、缺乏经验，由于认识上的偏差所引起的。因此，对于犯有错误的团员的正确态度应该是，既要严肃认真地帮助他们纠正错误，又要保护他们对革命事业的积极性不受伤害；只要他们能够认识和愿意改正错误，就不应该轻易地处分他们。即使对那些错误情节严重，应该给予处分的同志，在给予处分的时候，也要注意充分听取他们的意见，保障他们为自己申辩的正当权利。这样做不仅可以避免在处分中发生错误，而且可以使受处分的同志得到更多的教育。对于已经受了处分的同志，在处分之后，也要经常注意帮助他们，给他们以必要的鼓励，欢迎他们的每一个进步，即使是微小的进步也应该欢迎。（三）
    民主集中制是团的基本的组织原则。民主和集中是不可分割的，但是，对青年团来说，应该更多地强调发扬民主。这是因为，青年团是青年的群众组织，青年团组织的主人是全体青年团员，只有充分地发扬民主，才能更好地发挥每一个团员的积极性和创造性，提高他们在团的生活中的主人翁的责任感。只有充分发扬民主，才能更好地集中群众的智慧，使团的领导机关的工作更加符合实际情况，才能够充分地反映广大青年的要求和愿望，才能够更好地密切上下级的联系，密切团的组织同广大团员和青年群众的联系。同时也只有充分发扬民主，才能够更好地达到教育团员的目的，并且使他们在民主生活中逐渐养成遇事能够独立思考的能力和民主的作风。
    应该说，我们大多数团的组织是注意发扬团内民主的，我们团内的民主生活一般是正常的。但是，这并不是说，我们团内的民主生活已经没有什么问题了，我们在这方面还有许多缺点，违反民主、破坏民主原则的现象也并不是很个别的。首先在团中央的领导上就存在许多缺点。团的第三次全国代表大会迟开了一年，中央委员会的全体会议也开得少了。在这个期间，虽然团中央也曾召开过许多次工作会议，讨论和研究了团的工作中不少重要的问题，但是，这些会议毕竟不能代替中央委员会全体会议的作用。团中央常委会的集体领导也是不健全的。对于来自下面的一些意见和要求缺乏应有的重视和认真的研究，有些问题的决定还显得草率，缺乏充分的酝酿、讨论。对于有些事情的要求也显得过死，没有充分照顾到各个地方的不同情况。应该说，类似的情况在省、市以下不少团的组织中也是程度不同地存在着的。有不少团的县委和区委，常常长时间开不起会来，这固然一方面是由于客观上存在一些困难，但是主观上对加强团的集体领导注意不够，也还是一个很重要的原因。另外，还有些团的组织，只要求团员尽义务，而不大重视保障团员和下级组织的民主权利，选举中不大注意充分发扬民主；对来自下面的申诉、批评和建议，也缺乏认真的处理。也还有个别团的领导干部，对于持有和自己不同意见或者是对领导上提出批评的人，粗暴地采取压制和打击报复的办法。很显然，这些态度和作法都是很错误的，必须引起足够的警惕和认真地加以克服。
    针对以上情况并且根据几年来团的建设的经验，新的团章（草案）就扩大团内民主增加了下列的一些规定：
    第一，规定了团员“对于团的决议如果有不同意的地方，除了无条件地执行以外，可以保留或者向团的领导机关提出自己的意见”。规定了团员有权“参加团的组织通过对自己的处分决议的会议，并且可以申辩”。
    第二，规定了“各级组织必须充分发扬民主，切实保障团员的民主权利，使他们能够自由、切实地讨论团的工作和团组织中的各种问题，充分发挥他们的积极性和创造性”；“各级领导机关应当经常听取和认真处理下级组织和团员的意见”；“各级组织必须经常用批评和自我批评的方法来揭露和消除工作中的缺点和错误。要鼓励自下而上的批评，特别是鼓励团员和青年对团的领导机关和工作人员提出坦率的批评和建议；反对任何压制批评的行为。”
    第三，扩大了全国代表会议的权力，规定全国代表会议不仅有权讨论团内重大问题，而且还有权免除占总数七分之一的中央委员和候补中央委员的职务，并且有权补选占总数七分之一的候补中央委员。
    第四，规定了“省、自治区、直辖市、自治州委员会的全体会议每年至少召开两次。县、自治县、市委员会的全体会议每年至少召开三次”。
    第五，规定了“团的各级组织实行集体领导和个人负责相结合的制度”。
    可以肯定，这些规定对于保障团员和下级团组织的民主权利，加强团的集体领导，健全和发展团内民主生活，必将带来很大的好处。同时它也将会有利于团内集中的加强。我们青年团是一支先进青年的战斗队伍，我们强调民主，也正是为了更有效地达到政治上、组织上的一致，从而加强团的战斗力。
    在团章（草案）讨论过程中，有些同志提出，既然要扩大团内民主，为什么还要将全国代表大会由三年召开一次改为四年召开一次呢？有些同志提出为什么不在团内实行各级代表大会代表的常任制呢？
    我们认为，把全国代表大会的召开由每三年一次改为四年一次，是为了使它可以和每二年召开一次的省、自治区、直辖市、自治州代表大会在时间上衔接起来，这样，不仅便利于选举出席全国代表大会代表的工作，而且对中央和地方上下之间工作的安排上，也有许多方便。同时，由于扩大了全国代表会议的权力，只要我们今后能够努力做到一年左右召开一次全国代表会议，那末，就总的情况来说，团内民主并不会因为把召开全国代表大会的时间延长一年而受到损害。
    至于说到常任制，这对我们的党来说，它确实是扩大党内民主的一个很重要的措施。但是对于我们青年团来说，却有不同的情况，因为青年团的干部流动较快，同时也因为青年团是有年龄限制的组织，要求全国代表大会的代表能够全部或者大多数都能连任四年是很困难的。这样，如果在四年中间，有许多代表都已调离青年团的工作，或者由于“超龄”而离开了团的组织，那么所谓常任制不就是“有名无实”了吗？基于同样的理由，常任制对于地方各级代表大会来说，也是不很适宜的。有些同志提出，为什么要规定全国代表会议有权免除部分中央委员和候补中央委员的职务和补选部分候补中央委员呢？我们认为，这样做，除了可以加强全团对于团中央委员会的工作和每个中央委员的监督以外，还由于团的中央委员在四年任期中间也常常免不了有些人调离青年团的工作，而不能不另选别的同志来递补。
    同志们，关于新的团章（草案），我要说明的就是这些。大家可以看得很清楚，它和现行团章比较起来，并没有涉及到团的根本性质的改变，就是说没有改变青年团是中国共产党领导下的先进青年的群众组织，是党的助手；没有改变它是以共产主义思想教育青年的学校；没有改变团的组织是按民主集中制的原则建立起来的。但是，它确有一些重大的带有原则性的修改。这些改变要求我们把团的建设提到一个更高的水平，以便更好地适应党和人民的要求，适应青年的要求，更好地发挥它在广大青年群众中和社会主义建设中的先锋作用和突击作用。
    我们相信，有着中国共产党和毛主席的亲切领导，有着长一辈和社会上各方面的支持和帮助，有了这次大会所制定的工作方针、任务和团的章程，依靠全团努力，经过更艰苦、更深入、更细致的工作，今后，我们将一定会把团的队伍建设得更好，把我国各民族的青年更好地团结在党的周围，为祖国立功，为社会主义建设和人类最崇高的事业——共产主义事业，作出更大的贡献。
    同志们，在结束我的报告的时候，我建议我们的大会通过提交大会讨论的团章（草案）作为中国共产主义青年团的章程。
