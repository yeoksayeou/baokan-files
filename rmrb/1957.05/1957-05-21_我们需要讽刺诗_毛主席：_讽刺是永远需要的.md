We Need Satirical Poetry
——Chairman Mao: "Satire is always needed"
Zang Kejia

In the few years since liberation, the output of satirical poetry has become less and less, and truly excellent works are rare. The vast readership is clamoring for satirical poetry, anxious about its poor harvest.

Satirical poetry is a sharp weapon. Poets use it to express their dissatisfaction with politics and society, hoping to arouse resonance and attention, and achieve the effect of criticism and education. Starting with the "Book of Songs," many poets throughout the ages have written satirical poems. Du Fu and Bai Juyi's collections contain many such works, mostly famous pieces, loved by readers and passed down to this day. The latter even highlighted "admonitory poems" as a category, considering them to be his main works. These poems are the poets' expressions of injustice against wars of aggression, the extravagance of emperors, and unreasonable social phenomena. These poems are deeply moving. Although the times are far apart, we are still moved when we read them today, what is called resonating across centuries. The main reason for such an effect is that the poet feels deeply and is indignant about the phenomena he satirizes. "Anger creates poets," this famous saying is very accurate.

The purpose of poets writing these satirical poems is to expose some events that poets consider unfair, so as to attract the attention of those in power and thus achieve improvement. These poems are not meant to negate the political system at the time; on the contrary, they are meant to better maintain it. Satirizing the bad is in order to make "those who hear it sufficient to take warning."

In the brief history of new poetry since the May Fourth Movement, satirical poetry has also written a glorious page. From 1941 until the national liberation, satirical poetry became the mainstream of new poetry, and every poet wrote a large number of satirical poems. This was the result of the times. If he was truly a poet placed in the Chiang-controlled area, he would definitely write satirical poems. Among such works, "Ma Fanto's Mountain Song" exerted the power of a weapon and had a greater impact. At that time, some folk songs and folk rhymes also truthfully reflected social phenomena and did their best in satire. For example:

	"With gold (gold bars) there is reason, with no currency (‘legal tender’) there is no law." In just eight characters, the social situation under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang is exposed completely, spicy and thought-provoking.

These satirical poems satirizing the Chiang regime are actually not only satire, but also exposure. Its purpose is not to maintain that system but to overthrow it, which is different from the intention of ancient poets writing satirical poems.

After the national liberation, satirical poetry seemed to have lost its opponent, and many poets sheathed their swords. Satirical poetry decreased, and odes increased. It is not that poets do not know that imperialism is still eyeing us covetously, eager to wipe our country off the face of the earth; it is not that they do not know that there are still many things in our society that hinder progress that need to be exposed and criticized, but why don't poets stand up and give play to the patriotic enthusiasm of hating evil like an enemy?

Chairman Mao said: "Satire is always needed" ("Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art"). The difficulty for poets lies first in the standard and measure.

Today, to write satirical poetry, we must first have a clear distinction between ourselves and the enemy.

	"Criticism is needed for the shortcomings of the people,... but it must be based on the standpoint of the people...". I don’t need to say much about the enemy. Regarding the contradictions within the people, we must "speak with full enthusiasm for protecting and educating the people" (ibid.). These few words are truly to the point. In his report to the Nineteenth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Malenkov used "fire" to describe satire, needing it to burn away all dirty things. Chairman Mao used "full enthusiasm." The wording is different, but the meaning is the same. If a poet who loves the socialist motherland, loves the people's cause, has high political enthusiasm, a strong sense of responsibility, and a strong sense of justice, then the question of measure will not be a problem. Weren't the political satirical poems written by Mayakovsky satirical enough? But he was out of sincere love for the Soviet socialist motherland. He did not allow the slightest damage to it. His poems are like fire, wanting to burn away bureaucracy and all obstacles on the road to progress.

The same throat can sing odes and also spit out fiery satirical verses. One positive and one negative, the purpose is only one. Satirizing the bad is so that it does not harm the good. Satirical poetry is not something that is thought up, but something that jumps out of uncontrollable anger. Insipidness cannot become satirical poetry, and playful wording is only superficial. A poet of low character will not be able to open his mouth about bad things, and a person who cannot live frugally will not be aroused by indignation at the phenomenon of waste.

Truly standing firm, loving the socialist motherland like loving one's own mother, even the slightest thing that is unfavorable to her will arouse resentment out of love, sensitively, truthfully and boldly standing up. If a poet can do this, then he will write moving satirical poems. With a firm stand, clear love and hate, the question of measure should not be a problem. If it is really for curing the disease, what does it matter if the medicine tastes a little bitter?

    我们需要讽刺诗
    ——毛主席：“讽刺是永远需要的”
    臧克家
    解放后这几年来，讽刺诗的产量越来越少，真正优秀的作品，也不多见。广大读者吵着要讽刺诗，为它的歉收焦心。
    讽刺诗是尖锐的武器，诗人们用它抒发自己对政治、社会的不满，希望引起共鸣和注意，收到批评教育的效果。从“诗经”开始，历代不少诗人都写过讽刺性的诗篇。杜甫、白居易的集子里这类作品，多系名篇，为读者热爱，传诵至今。后者且以“讽谕诗”标举成类，认为它是自己的主要作品。这些诗，就是诗人们反对侵略战争，反对帝王奢淫，对社会不合理现象所作的不平之鸣。这些诗，深切动人，时代相去已远，然而今天读了，我们还是为之激动，所谓旷百世而相感。所以有这样的效果，主要是由于诗人对他所讽刺的现象感受深刻，愤懑不平。“愤怒造成诗人”，这句名言十分确切。
    诗人们写这些讽刺诗，目的在揭露一些诗人认为不平的事件，以便引起当道的注意，因而得到改善。这些诗，不是为了否定当时的政治制度，相反的，而是为了更好的维护它。讽刺了坏的，是为了使“闻之者足以戒”。
    在“五四”以来新诗的简短历史上，讽刺诗也写下了光辉的一页。1941年以后一直到全国解放之前，讽刺诗成为新诗的主流，每一个诗人都写了大量的讽刺诗。这是时代使然，置身蒋管区，如果他真是一个诗人，就一定会写讽刺诗。此类作品中“马凡陀的山歌”发挥了武器的力量，发生了较大的影响。那时候，有一些民歌、民谣，也真实地反映了社会现象，尽了讽刺的能事。例如：
      “有条（金条）有理，无法（“法币”）无天。”仅只八个大字，把国民党反动统治下的社会情况，暴露无余，辛辣耐人寻味。
    讽刺蒋政权的这些讽刺诗，实际上不仅是讽刺，而是暴露，它的目的，不在维护那个制度而是要推倒它，这一点和古代诗人们写讽刺诗的用意是不同的。
    全国解放了，讽刺诗好似失掉了作战的对手，许多诗人，刀入鞘了。讽刺诗少了，颂歌多了。诗人们也并不是不知道帝国主义还是在虎视眈眈地窥伺我们，恨不得从地球上把我们的国家抹掉；并不是不知道，我们的社会上还存在着许多妨碍进步的东西需要揭发，批评，可是，诗人们为什么不挺身而出发挥嫉恶如仇的爱国主义的热情呢？
    毛主席说过：“讽刺是永远需要的”（“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”）。诗人们为难之处，首先在标准和分寸上。
    今天写讽刺诗，首先要敌我界限分明。
      “对于人民的缺点，是需要批评的，……但必须是站在人民的立场上……”。对敌人，我不须多说了，对人民内部的矛盾，则必须“用保护人民、教育人民的满腔热情来说话”（同上）。这几句话真是一针见血。马林科夫在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会上的报告里，用“火”形容讽刺，需要它去烧掉一切肮脏东西，毛主席用了“满腔热情”，字句不一样，而意义却相同。如果一个热爱社会主义祖国，热爱人民事业，政治热情高，责任心重，正义感强的诗人，那么，分寸问题就会不成问题。马雅可夫斯基写的那些政治讽刺诗，讽刺得难道不够厉害？但他是出于热爱苏联社会主义祖国的赤诚，他不允许对它有丝毫的损害。他的诗句真像火，要把官僚主义和一切前进道路上的障碍物烧掉。
    同样一个喉咙，唱颂歌，同时也可以吐出火焰般的讽刺诗句，一正一反，目的只是一个。讽刺了坏的，是为了不使它损伤好的。讽刺诗，不是想出来的，而是从抑制不住的愤怒里跳出来的。不痛不痒不能成为讽刺诗，字句俏皮也仅是皮毛。一个品质不高的诗人，对于坏事情他张不开口，一个不能艰苦自奉的人，浪费现象就不会激起他的愤激情感。
    真正站稳了立场，爱社会主义祖国像爱自己的母亲，对于她不利的一切东西，即使很细微，也会激起从热爱出发的愤恨之情，敏感地、真实而大胆地挺身而出。一个诗人如果能够如此，那么，他会写出动人的讽刺诗。立场坚定，爱憎分明，分寸问题应该不成问题。真是为了治病，即使药味苦些那有什么关系？
