Located in the southeastern corner of Eastern Europe is the Romanian Republic,
	Rich in resources and fertile land,
	People are simple, kind, harmonious, and happy.
	Known worldwide as the granary of Europe,
	Oil is everywhere, containing essential talents,
	Moreover, there is a superior new system,
	Shining brightly like the rising sun.
To understand a country, one must observe the beauty of its people,
	Polite and courteous, many are gentlemen,
	Various ethnic groups live together,
	Loving and caring for each other as one.
Having endured more than a thousand years of hardship,
	Forging and striving, their will is even stronger,
	A mere eight or nine years since liberation,
	Breaking through historical precedents, their achievements are unparalleled.
Industry is advancing rapidly by leaps and bounds,
	Agriculture and animal husbandry are thriving, forming a land and sea of abundance,
	Clothing and food are abundant, with a high standard of living,
	Life in this paradise is truly delightful!
The scenery in the suburban gardens is beautiful,
	Roads are built amidst the green foliage,
	Rural architecture is innovative,
	Ten thousand forms and shapes compete for ingenuity.
I came to visit during the end of the year,
	Unaware that there are difficulties on the road,
	In the midst of heartfelt handshakes and laughter,
	Ice and snow melt into a spring that spreads endlessly.
China and Romania, though ten thousand miles apart, are truly close,
	Moreover, friendship is as strong as glue,
	Gathering together to get drunk on grape wine,
	This evening's grand gathering is unforgettable!

    访问罗马尼亚除夕欢宴席上喜赋长歌一章
    李济深罗马尼亚共和国，地处东欧南角落，物资富有地肥腴，人情朴厚和且乐。欧洲粮仓世擅名，石油遍地藏菁英，复有优越新制度，赫如旭日放光明。觇国须觇民质美，彬彬礼让多君子，民族多种杂居处，相亲相爱如一体。中经忧患千余年，锻炼奋斗志弥坚，解放区区八九载，突破史例功无前。工业駸駸日百里，农牧蕃滋成陆海，衣食丰盈水准高，乐园生活真可喜！郊外园林风景好，万绿丛中辟驰道，农村建筑意匠新，万态千形竞斗巧。我来观光值岁阑，不知世有行路难，倾衿握手欢笑里，冰雪化作春漫漫。中罗万里真咫尺，况复友好如胶漆，一堂共醉葡萄觞，盛会难忘是此夕！
