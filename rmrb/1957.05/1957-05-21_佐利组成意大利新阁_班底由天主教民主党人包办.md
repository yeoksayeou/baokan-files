    Zoli Forms New Italian Cabinet
    Dominated by Christian Democratic Party Members
    (Comprehensive report from this newspaper) Xinhua News Agency: After failing to reorganize the so-called "center-left" government jointly formed by the Christian Democratic Party, the Social Democratic Party, the Republican Party, and the Liberal Party, Adone Zoli, a senator of the Christian Democratic Party, formed a minority government on the 19th composed entirely of ministers from the Christian Democratic Party.
    According to Agence France-Presse, observers expressed doubts about the governing ability of this new government. Because the Christian Democratic Party only occupies 40% of the seats in parliament. Furthermore, Zoli's team is itself the product of factional infighting within the Christian Democratic Party: Zoli, who serves as Prime Minister and Minister of Budget, is center-left within the party. Giuseppe Bera, who serves as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs, is a well-known right-wing leader. And Guido Gonella, who serves as Minister of Justice, is a representative of the so-called left wing. Gonella had sought the position of Deputy Prime Minister without success, and later decided that he would also be responsible for "constitutional coordination," which barely held the team together.
    Zoli is 69 years old and is the chairman of the National Committee of the Italian Christian Democratic Party.
    During World War II, he was sentenced to death by Mussolini but fortunately survived.
    In previous Italian governments, he has successively served as Minister of Finance, Minister of Budget, and Minister of Justice, among other positions.
    It is announced that the main goal of the Zoli cabinet is to maintain the political situation in Italy, pending the general election in eleven months. In terms of foreign policy, this government guarantees strong support for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Western European Union. The new government will request a vote of confidence from both houses of parliament before the end of the month.
    During the government crisis, both the Italian Communist Party and the Socialist Party expressed their opposition to forming a one-party government by the Christian Democratic Party, as this would only make the political situation in Italy more chaotic. After the formation of the new Zoli cabinet, Italian Communist Party General Secretary Togliatti announced that the Communist Party will fight to the end against the Christian Democratic Party's attempt to act arbitrarily in Italy's political, economic, and social life.

### 佐利组成意大利新阁  班底由天主教民主党人包办

    佐利组成意大利新阁
    班底由天主教民主党人包办
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：在试图重新组织由天主教民主党、社会民主党、共和党和自由党联合起来的所谓“中间派”政府失败以后，天主教民主党上议院议员阿多内·佐利19日组成了完全由天主教民主党人担任部长的少数派政府。
    据法新社报道，观察家们对这个新政府的执政能力表示怀疑。因为，天主教民主党在议会中只占40％的议席，而且，佐利的班子本身就是天主教民主党内部派系斗争的产物：任总理兼预算部长的佐利在党内是中间偏左派，任副总理兼外交部长的朱塞佩·贝拉是有名的右翼领袖，而任司法部长的基多·戈内拉却是所谓左派的代表。戈内拉曾经争取副总理的职位而没有成功，后来决定由他兼负“协调宪法”的责任，才勉强把班子搭起来。
    佐利现年六十九岁，是意大利天主教民主党全国委员会主席。
    第二次世界大战期间，他曾被墨索里尼判过死刑，幸而保全了性命。
    在意大利历届政府中，他曾先后担任过财政部长、预算部长和司法部长等职务。
    据宣布，佐利内阁的主要目的在于维持意大利的政治局面，以待十一个月以后举行大选。在外交政策方面，这个政府保证大力支持北大西洋公约组织和西欧联盟。新政府将在月底以前要求议会两院举行信任投票。
    在政府危机期间，意大利共产党和社会党都曾经表示反对组织天主教民主党一党政府，因为这只会使意大利的政治局势更加混乱。在佐利新阁组成后，意大利共产党总书记陶里亚蒂宣布，共产党将同天主教党力图在意大利政治、经济和社会生活方面专断独行的行径斗争到底。
