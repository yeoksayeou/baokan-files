    Actively Develop Subsidiary Food Production Near Cities and Industrial and Mining Areas
    The inability to meet the needs of the broad masses of people for subsidiary foods is an important problem in China's current economic life. In cities and industrial and mining areas, this problem is even more prominent. There are varying degrees of supply shortages for subsidiary foods such as vegetables, meat, milk, fruit, and eggs. Many of these subsidiary foods are needed by people every day. According to surveys in some areas, the consumption of subsidiary foods in large and medium-sized cities and industrial and mining areas accounts for about 20% of residents' purchasing power. In food expenses, it generally accounts for about 40% to 60%. However, this spring, the vegetable supply in many cities and industrial and mining areas was only 50% to 60% of normal needs, and in some individual cities, it did not even reach 50%. The pork supply is particularly insufficient. To solve this problem, large quantities of vegetables had to be transferred from other places during the winter and spring seasons, which caused great losses to the country. From January to April this year, 310 million jin of vegetables were transferred from Shandong, Hebei, Henan, Guangdong and other places to Beijing, Shanghai, Hankou, and cities in Northeast China. If the loss rate is calculated at one-tenth, the country will lose 31 million jin, worth 580,000 yuan. Transportation requires about 10,000 railway cars, as well as a large amount of packaging and cold-proof equipment.
    The fundamental key to solving this contradiction is to vigorously develop the production of subsidiary foods near cities and industrial and mining areas. This is because: First, most subsidiary foods are fresh commodities, perishable and easily damaged, and not suitable for long-distance transportation. The broad masses of people need them every day, in large quantities and many varieties. Therefore, it is most economical and convenient to produce and supply them locally. Second, the production of subsidiary foods in the vast rural areas generally has a large degree of self-sufficiency, and the amount of commodities is not large. In addition, the consumption level of subsidiary foods for farmers will also gradually increase, so it is difficult to rapidly increase the commodity volume of subsidiary foods in rural areas. Third, with the development of national construction, cities and industrial and mining areas are expanding and increasing day by day. The trend of development is to gradually make all provinces (regions) in China become areas with industry. This will make those areas that used to be able to transfer out large quantities of subsidiary foods unable to transfer out, or reduce the transfer, because they have to supply local needs. In order to avoid falling into more and more difficulties, cities and industrial and mining areas must vigorously develop subsidiary food production nearby, establish and cultivate subsidiary food production and supply bases, so as to produce enough self-sufficient vegetables, milk, and a certain degree of self-sufficient meat, poultry, and eggs.
    Developing the production of subsidiary foods near cities and industrial and mining areas not only plays a decisive role in alleviating the insufficient supply of subsidiary foods in cities and industrial and mining areas, but also plays a certain role in increasing the income of farmers in these areas and alleviating the supply of subsidiary foods (such as pork) in rural areas. This reasoning is also very obvious. Therefore, the suggestions made at the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China regarding the second Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy pointed out: "Near cities and industrial and mining areas, increasing the production of vegetables and other subsidiary foods to supply the needs of cities and industrial and mining areas should be taken as an important task." It is hoped that all large and medium-sized cities and industrial and mining areas will follow this spirit, and, based on local conditions and needs, specifically plan the production of subsidiary foods near cities and industrial and mining areas, and actively organize the implementation of these plans.
    The focus of developing the production of subsidiary foods in cities and industrial and mining areas is to increase the production of vegetables and live pigs. This is because these two items are the subsidiary foods that people in cities and industrial and mining areas need in the largest quantities, and the supply of which is also the most prominently unable to meet needs. Of course, while developing the production of vegetables and live pigs, it is also necessary to actively develop the production of cattle, sheep, dairy cows, poultry, and fruits.
    The main reason for the insufficient vegetable supply in many cities and industrial and mining areas is that the area planted with vegetables was not appropriately increased as a backup force when arranging the vegetable planting area. The population of some cities has increased significantly, while the increase in the area planted with vegetables is small, which is not commensurate. In some cities, basic construction occupies too much cultivated vegetable land. Although some new vegetable land has been added, the yield is far less than that of the old vegetable land, and the fertilizers, labor, and investment required are also more than those of the old vegetable land, so producers are unwilling to actively develop new vegetable land. Based on this situation, when arranging the vegetable planting area, it is necessary to appropriately plant more according to different seasons and different varieties, combined with the local degree of natural disasters such as drought, flood, frost, and freezing, as a backup force to ensure normal supply in case of disaster and reduced production. When formulating urban construction plans, all localities should pay attention to not occupying too much cultivated vegetable land, and should plan to develop new vegetable land, especially paying attention to maintaining a certain area of cultivated vegetable land. Cultivated vegetable land that has been designated as basic construction land but has not yet been constructed should be used as much as possible for planting vegetables. In some areas, vegetable producers lack fertilizer, pesticides, and seeds; some are afraid that market prices will fall if they plant too much; and some are afraid that opening up new vegetable land will affect grain self-sufficiency, so they are unwilling to actively open up new vegetable land. These problems require the close combination and mutual cooperation of party and government leading organs and relevant departments in all localities to effectively solve them. In order to ensure the interests of producers and eliminate producers' concerns about incurring losses due to planting too much, large and medium-sized cities and industrial and mining areas can separately stipulate minimum purchase prices according to the principle of ensuring that producers do not lose money. As long as the vegetables are planted by producers in accordance with the national plan, rather than blindly planted by themselves, state-owned units must purchase and dispose of them at the current minimum purchase price when the peak season exceeds market demand and prices are too low. Grain departments must guarantee the grain supply for those who cannot achieve grain self-sufficiency due to opening up new vegetable land as required by the national plan.
    As long as the problems hindering vegetable production are effectively solved in this way, as long as the problems in the production of various subsidiary foods are effectively solved, the production of subsidiary foods can be rapidly developed.

### 积极发展城市和工矿区附近的副食品生产

    积极发展城市和工矿区附近的副食品生产
    副食品不能满足广大人民的需要，是我国目前经济生活中的一个重要问题。在城市和工矿区，这个问题更为突出。蔬菜、肉类、乳类、水果、蛋等副食品，都有不同程度的供不应求现象。这些副食品，有许多是人民天天需要的。根据若干地区调查，大、中城市和工矿区副食品的消费，占居民购买力的20％左右。在伙食费中，一般约占40％到60％。但是今年春天，许多城市和工矿区的蔬菜供应量仅及正常需要量的50％到60％，有个别的城市甚至还达不到50％。猪肉供应尤其不足。为解决这一问题，冬春二季不得不从外地调入大量蔬菜，这就给国家造成很大的损失。今年1月到4月由山东、河北、河南、广东等地调到北京、上海、汉口及东北各城市的蔬菜达三亿一千万斤，损耗率按十分之一计算，国家就要损失三千一百万斤，值五十八万元。运输约需一万多个车皮，并需大量的包装、防寒设备。
    解决这一矛盾的基本关键，是大力发展城市和工矿区附近的副食品生产。这是因为：第一、副食品大都是活鲜商品，易腐易伤，不宜长途运输，而广大人民又天天需要，数量很大，品种很多，所以只有就近生产，就近供应，才最为经济，方便。第二、广大农村的副食品生产一般带有很大的自给性，商品量不大。加以农民的副食品消费水平也要逐渐提高，所以农村副食品的商品量就很难有迅速的增加。第三、随着国家建设事业的发展，城市、工矿区日益扩大和增加，发展的趋势是使我国所有各省（区）都逐渐成为拥有工业的区域，这就会使那些过去能够大量调出副食品的地区也因为要供给本地需要而不能调出，或者减少调出。为了避免陷入越来越多的困难，城市和工矿区就必须在附近大力发展副食品生产、建立和培养副食品生产和供应基地，以便出产足够自给的蔬菜、牛奶和一定程度自给的肉类、禽类和蛋类。
    发展城市和工矿区附近的副食品生产，不仅对于缓和城市和工矿区的副食品供应不足的形势有着决定性的作用，而且对于增加这些地区农民的收入，缓和农村副食品（如猪肉）供应，都有一定的作用。这种道理也是很明显的。因此党的第八次全国代表大会关于发展国民经济的第二个五年计划的建议指出：“城市附近和工矿区附近应该把增产蔬菜等各种副食品供应城市和工矿区的需要作为重要任务。”希望各大、中城市和工矿区本此精神，根据当地的条件和需要，对城市和工矿区附近的副食品生产具体加以规划，并积极组织这些计划的实现。
    发展城市和工矿区的副食品生产的重点，在于增加蔬菜和生猪生产。因为这两项是城市、工矿区人民需要数量最大，而且也是供应不能满足需要比较突出的副食品。当然，在发展蔬菜和生猪生产的同时，也要积极发展牛、羊、乳牛、家禽和水果等生产。
    许多城市和工矿区的蔬菜供应不足，主要原因是在安排蔬菜种植面积时，没有适当地多种一些，作为后备力量。有的城市人口增加较多，而蔬菜种植面积的增加较小，不相适应。有的城市附近因基本建设占用熟菜地过多，虽然补充了一些新菜地，但产量远不如旧菜地高，而且需要的肥料、劳力和投资也比旧菜地多，所以生产者不愿积极开辟新菜地。根据这种情况，在安排蔬菜种植面积时，就要根据不同季节、不同品种，结合当地可能发生旱、涝、霜、冻等自然灾害的程度，适当地多种一些，作为后备力量，保证万一受灾减产时仍能正常供应。各地在制定城市建设规划时，注意不要过多占用熟菜地，并且有计划地发展新菜地，特别要注意保持一定面积的熟菜地。已经划为基本建设用地但尚未施工的熟菜地，要尽量利用种植蔬菜。有的地区蔬菜生产者缺肥料，缺农药，缺种籽，有的怕种多了市场价格下降，也有的怕开辟了新菜地影响粮食自给，因而不愿积极开辟新菜地。这些问题，都需要各地党政领导机关及有关部门紧密结合，互相协作，切实加以解决。为了确保生产者的利益，并消除生产者怕种多了发生亏累的顾虑，各大、中城市和工矿区可以根据保证生产者不赔的原则，分别规定最低收购价格。只要是生产者按照国家计划种植的蔬菜，而不是自己盲目种植的，当旺季超过市场需要、价格过低时，国营单位必须按现定最低收购价格进行收购处理。凡是因按照国家计划要求开辟新菜地而致粮食不能自给的，粮食部门必须保证粮食供应。
    只要这样切实地解决阻碍蔬菜生产的问题，只要切实解决各种副食品生产中的问题，副食品生产就可以迅速发展。
