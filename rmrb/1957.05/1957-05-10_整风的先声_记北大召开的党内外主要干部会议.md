    Overture to Rectification
    ——A Record of the Meeting of Key Party and Non-Party Cadres at Peking University
    Our Reporter
    Peking University held a meeting of key Party and non-Party cadres on the 6th, 7th, and 9th, to examine the school's leadership work in accordance with the spirit of Chairman Mao's report on the correct handling of contradictions among the people. At these three days of meetings, professors sharply criticized sectarianism, bureaucratism, and dogmatism in the school's leadership work. They also raised many opinions about the leadership work of the Ministry of Higher Education.

    Who to Rely on to Run the School

    The abnormal relationship between the Party and the masses is a widespread phenomenon in schools today. This is primarily manifested in the question of who to rely on to run the school, that is, how to correctly treat senior intellectuals. Professor Fu Ying, a colloid chemist, said that over the years, people of middle age and older have become almost demoralized and are in a useless position. Especially after the Three-Anti Campaign, people felt even more that "the old are old and their words are light." Some people think that older people's minds are full of old ideas, and their words are not worth listening to. In the past six years, the school authorities have not consulted us on the school's policies and major plans. All work is often implemented from top to bottom by the Ministry of Higher Education, which inevitably leads to many problems. If we listened to the opinions of the old professors and utilized their decades of teaching experience, there would be many benefits. He said that the issue of senior intellectuals is simple in some ways and complex in others. They do not ask you to be particularly polite or to give them special treatment, but only that you do not treat them as outsiders and that you value their knowledge. After the Intellectuals Conference, the leadership only paid attention to giving professors raises and promotions, giving them front-row seats at the theater, and letting them cut in line when getting haircuts and buying things, but did not pay attention to bringing their enthusiasm into play in their work. This did not touch the core of intellectuals' concerns.

    Professor Yang Renbian said that since 1952, we have proposed relying on activists to run the school well. But have these activists played a bridging role, or have they further alienated the leadership from the masses? This is doubtful. Dividing everyone into three categories—active, middle-of-the-road, and backward—will only have bad consequences. Some activists are good at understanding the leadership's intentions, but are actually intellectual lazybones. And those so-called backward people are not valued, and they just muddle through their days. He believes that this divide must be filled, and we must rely on the broad masses of intellectuals and value their experience to run the school well.

    Whether intellectuals need to transform their thinking is a matter of differing opinions at the meeting. Professor Fu Ying said that he was most averse to the words "ideological remolding." As soon as he heard these words, he immediately thought of labor reform at the Qinghe Farm. Bourgeois ideology is naturally bad, but it is not entirely undesirable. It is only when it is completely undesirable that it needs to be transformed. Professor Feng Youlan and Professor Cui Zhilan suggested in their speeches that ideological remolding was needed. Professor Cui Zhilan said that in the face of the new situation, all 600 million people need to be transformed. The problem is that in the past, some Party members considered themselves to be transformers, believing that their own thinking was completely correct and specializing in transforming others. This aroused resentment. Party members and non-Party members should transform themselves together.

    Ignoring the Loyal Advice of Non-Party Comrades

    The abnormal relationship between the Party and the masses is also manifested in the sectarian sentiments of some Party members. Professor Cui Zhilan said that sectarianism is very prominent among some Party members. Before the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries Campaign, I made a suggestion about Vice-President Jiang Longji's report being too long. During the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries Campaign, I was criticized by Party members and Youth League members for not respecting the leadership. On another occasion, Party members and Youth League members in the department discussed advancing towards science and invited me to participate. At the meeting, I said that advancing towards science is not an easy task, and one must work hard oneself. If one does not work hard oneself and treats the teacher as a dictionary, this is probably a form of exploitation. Some Party members are most afraid of talking about exploitation. Because I said this, I was severely criticized by a Party member comrade at a department-wide meeting. Some young comrades have no major shortcomings as working comrades, but as Party members, they are arrogant and domineering. This will only alienate straightforward and upright people from the Party and bring them closer to a group of people who sing praises. The Party Committee should bear the responsibility of "the father is at fault for not teaching."

    The School is Institutionalized and Bureaucratized

    Using administrative orders to lead scientific research is a manifestation of bureaucratism. Professor Wang Tieya said that we are now seeing the school become institutionalized and bureaucratized. When people enter Peking University, they can see many teaching buildings, and it seems that the academic atmosphere is very strong. But as long as you stay in the school for a day or two and observe carefully, you will find that there is an office in each building, and every day it is noisy with administrative, financial, housing, and other issues. The so-called leadership is nothing more than planning, meetings, conveying, and arranging. As a result, administration overrides everything, and the academic atmosphere declines. Administrative-ism is the root of bureaucratism. It is very easy to lead teaching and scientific research with administrative methods, but it cannot solve the problems. Currently, administrative-ism has become a trend. People do not measure a professor's knowledge and ability by their academic status, but by what director or what head they are, and even the ridiculous statement "Professor so-and-so has been promoted to department head" has appeared in the newspapers. He advocated eliminating the bureaucratic style and promoting the academic style. Professor Tang Peisong also criticized the thin academic atmosphere of the school. He said that apart from the recent historical lectures and the one time that President Ma Yinchu publicly spoke about population issues, he has not seen any university-wide academic reports at Peking University.

    Professor Yang Renbian said that one manifestation of bureaucratism is the low work efficiency. The History Department had to call the Personnel Department ten times and go in person three times to add a librarian before the problem was solved. Professor Wang Zhongmin criticized the school leaders for not going deep into the lower levels and being high above. As a department head, he had only talked to Vice-President Jiang and the Party Committee Secretary once from 1952 to 1957. Because there is no communication between the upper and lower levels, problems often occur in the work.

    Not Believing in Chinese Experts

    Everyone also expressed their deep disgust for the prevalence of dogmatism in teaching. Professor Yang Renbian said that since the teaching reform, we have made many mistakes. First, we severed the Chinese tradition and mechanically copied foreign things. We only believed in foreign experts and did not believe in Chinese experts. Second, we were eager for quick results and tried to help seedlings grow by pulling them up. For example, one-sidedly emphasizing that cadre training should be good, fast, and economical has caused great difficulties for teaching work. Third, we learned from the Soviet experience without combining it with the Chinese situation. For example, there is a course in world history in Soviet universities, but China only has the conditions to teach Western history. I suggested that the world history course be renamed Western history, but this was opposed by dogmatism.

    Professor Feng Youlan agreed with Professor Yang Renbian's opinion, saying that the leadership's trust in Chinese experts was a little lacking and always tended to underestimate them. The China Modern Thought History Outline, which was produced by the Peking University China Philosophy History Teaching and Research Office the year before last, was wanted by outside schools, but the leadership was afraid that there would be mistakes and did not allow it to be taken out. Later, Mr. Tao Dayong, the editor of New Construction, took it to New Construction after a struggle, and it was welcomed by readers. Now the outline has been published by the bookstore and has been circulated to Japan, and a university in Japan has even held a special meeting to discuss this outline. Looking at this outline today, there are still many problems, mainly dogmatism, but the reason why the leadership did not allow it to be published at that time was not because it was considered too dogmatic, but because it was considered not dogmatic enough.

    A total of fifteen teachers spoke at the meeting. In addition to the above-mentioned issues, Professor Sun Guohua criticized the Ministry of Higher Education for not paying attention to the psychology profession, Professor Cao Jinghua made suggestions to the Ministry of Higher Education on issues such as the assignment of graduates from Russian language schools, and Professor Huang Kun mentioned strengthening the political and ideological work of teachers. In addition, several professors also talked about the issue of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend. The meeting held by Peking University this time has not yet ended. Judging from the problems exposed at the meeting, this meeting has become the overture to the rectification movement at Peking University.

    整风的先声
    ——记北大召开的党内外主要干部会议
    本报记者
    北京大学在6日、7日、9日举行党内外主要干部会议，根据毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的报告的精神，检查学校的领导工作。这三天会上，教授们对学校领导工作中的宗派主义、官僚主义和教条主义，提出了尖锐的批评。也对高教部的领导工作提出了不少意见。
    依靠谁来办学校
    党群关系不够正常，是目前学校中普遍存在的现象。这首先表现在依靠谁来办学校的问题上，也就是怎样正确的对待高级知识分子的问题。胶体化学家傅鹰教授说，这些年来，中年以上的人差不多都消沉起来，处于无用的地位。特别是三反以后，更使人感到“人老言轻”。有些人认为年纪老的人满脑袋旧思想，他们的话不值得一听。六年来学校当局没有找过我们讨论学校的方针大计，一切工作往往由高教部从上往下的贯彻，这难免要发生很多问题。如果听听老教授的意见，利用他们几十年的教学经验，就会有很多好处。他说高级知识分子问题说简单也简单，说复杂也复杂。他们不要求你对他们特别客气，或特别优待，只要求不把他们当作外人，重视他们的知识。知识分子会议后，领导上只注意对教授加级加薪，看戏坐前排，理发买东西不排队，而不注意在工作中发挥他们的积极性，这是没有摸对知识分子的脾气。
    杨人楩教授说，1952年以来，我们提出依靠积极分子来办好学校。但是这些积极分子到底是起了桥梁作用呢，还是使领导和群众更疏远呢？值得怀疑。将所有的人分为积极、中间、落后三类，只会发生不好的后果。有些积极分子，善于体会领导的意图，实际上是思想上的懒汉。而所谓落后的人，不受重视，也只好悠悠岁月。他认为必须将这条鸿沟填平，依靠广大的知识分子，重视他们的经验来办好学校。
    知识分子要不要改造思想，在会上是有不同的意见的。傅鹰教授说他对“思想改造”这几个字最反感。一听到这几个字，就联想到清河农场的劳动改造。资产阶级思想自然是不好，但不完全是要不得，完全要不得才要改造。冯友兰教授和崔芝兰教授在发言中，提出需要思想改造。崔芝兰教授说，在新形势面前，六亿人民大家都需要改造。问题是过去有些党员以改造者自居。认为自己的思想完全正确，而专门来改造别人，这样使人引起反感。党员和非党员应该一起改造。
    不听非党同志的忠告
    党群关系不正常，还表现在某些党员的宗派主义情绪上。崔芝兰教授说，在某些党员中，宗派主义非常突出。在肃反前，我对江隆基副校长的作报告时间太长提出意见，在肃反时就受到党团员的批评，说我不尊重领导。又有一次系内党团员讨论向科学进军，请我参加。在会上我说向科学进军不是一件容易的事，要自己下苦功。如果自己不努力，把老师当成字典，这恐怕是一种剥削思想。某些党员最忌讳说剥削思想。我因为说了这一句话，在一次系的大会上受到一个党员同志声色俱厉的批评。有些年青同志作为一个工作同志来讲没有多大的缺点，作为一个党员来讲架子就大了，盛气凌人。这样做只会使直言无讳的正派的人和党疏远了，另外亲近一批歌功颂德的人。党委会应该负“养不教、父之过”的责任。
    学校机关化、衙门化
    以行政命令的方法来领导科学研究，是官僚主义的一种表现。王铁崖教授说，我们现在是学校机关化、衙门化。人们一进北京大学，可以看到好多的教学大楼，好像学术空气很浓。但是只要在学校内耽上一、二天，深入观察一下，就会发现每个楼内都有一个办公室，每天吵吵闹闹的，都是行政、经费、房屋等问题。所谓领导，也无非就是计划、会议、传达、布置。结果行政压倒一切，学术空气下降。行政主义是官僚主义的根源。用行政方法来领导教学和科学研究，是很省事的，但不能解决问题。目前行政主义已经形成一种风气，人们不是以学术地位来衡量一个教授的学识才能，而是以什么主任什么长来表示一个人的学识才能，甚至在报上也出现了“某某教授升为系主任”的可笑提法。他主张要肃清官风，提倡学风。汤佩松教授也批评了学校学术空气稀薄。他说，北京大学除了最近开办的历史讲座和马寅初校长公开讲过一次人口问题外，就没有看到全校性的学术报告了。
    杨人楩教授说，官僚主义的一个表现是工作效率不高，历史系为了增加一个资料员，给人事处打过十次电话，亲自去过三次，才解决问题。王重民教授批评学校领导不深入下层，高高在上。他作为一个系主任，从1952年到1957年只和江副校长和党委书记交谈过一次。由于上下不通气，工作中时常发生一些问题。
    不相信中国专家
    对教学工作中的教条主义流行，大家也表示深恶痛绝。杨人楩教授说，自从教学改革以来，我们犯了好多错误。第一是割断中国的传统，生搬外国的东西。只相信外国的专家，不相信中国的专家。第二是求效心切，揠苗助长。例如片面的强调培养干部要又好又快又省，结果给教学工作造成很大的困难。第三是学习苏联经验，没有和中国情况结合。例如苏联大学中有一门世界史，而中国只有教西洋史的条件，我建议将世界史的课程改称西洋史，就遭到教条主义的反对。
    冯友兰教授同意杨人楩教授的意见，说领导上对中国专家的信任差一点，总是往低的方面估计。前年北大中国哲学史教研室搞了一个中国近代思想史提纲，外边的学校想要，领导上怕有错误，不许往外拿。后来新建设编者陶大镛先生经过一番斗争，拿去在新建设发表了，受到读者欢迎。现在提纲已由书店出版，并一直传到日本，日本一个大学还专门开会讨论这一提纲。这个提纲今天看来问题还不少，主要是教条主义，而那时领导上所以不让发表，倒不是嫌有教条主义，而是嫌教条主义不够。
    在会上发言的共有十五位教师。除了上述问题外，孙国华教授对高教部不重视心理学专业提出批评，曹靖华教授对俄语学校毕业生分配等问题向高教部作了建议，黄昆教授提到了加强对教师的政治思想工作等问题。此外好几位教授还谈到了百家争鸣的问题。北大这次举行的会议还未结束，从会上揭发的问题来看，这次会议成了北大整风运动的先声。
