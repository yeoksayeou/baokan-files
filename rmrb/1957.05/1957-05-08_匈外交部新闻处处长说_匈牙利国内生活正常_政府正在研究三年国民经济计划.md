Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, 7th. Gyaros Laszlo, Head of the Information Department of the Hungarian Foreign Ministry, said at a press conference on the afternoon of the 6th that the upcoming National Assembly meeting will discuss revising certain chapters of the constitution and supplementing members of parliament and government agencies.

Gyaros answered some questions raised by reporters at the meeting.

When talking about the domestic situation in Hungary, Gyaros emphasized that life in Hungary has returned to normal. The large-scale celebrations of May Day reflected the healthy mood of the working masses. Now, the activities of the counter-revolution have gone underground. Some counter-revolutionaries are still distributing reactionary leaflets through the post office, and leaflets and pamphlets hostile to the people's democratic system continue to be sent to Hungary.

When talking about Hungary's economic situation, Gyaros said that the government is studying a three-year national economic plan. The 1957 plan has been formulated and is being successfully implemented. One of the main goals of this plan is to overcome the difficulties and make up for the damage caused to Hungary's national economy by the counter-revolutionary rebellion. Gyaros pointed out the invaluable assistance of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, which gave Hungary 300 million U.S. dollars in goods, raw materials and free foreign exchange.

The head of the information department also said that industrial production is now recovering smoothly. The total industrial income in January last year was 3,601 million forints, and in January this year it was 2,213 million forints; it was 2,986 million forints in February last year, and 2,909 million forints in February this year.

Regarding the Hungarian refugee issue, he said that about 20,000 refugees have returned home. If the Western authorities do not obstruct them, the number of people returning home will increase significantly.

    匈外交部新闻处处长说
    匈牙利国内生活正常
    政府正在研究三年国民经济计划
    据新华社布达佩斯7日电　匈牙利外交部新闻处处长吉亚罗什·拉斯洛6日下午在记者招待会上说，最近即将举行的国民议会会议将讨论修改宪法的某些章节、补充议会议员和政府机构成员等问题。
    吉亚罗什在会上回答了记者们提出的一些问题。
    在谈到匈牙利国内情况的时候，吉亚罗什强调指出，匈牙利国内的生活已经正常化了。庆祝“五一”节的大规模活动反映了劳动群众健康的情绪。现在，反革命的活动已经转入地下，有些反革命分子还通过邮局传递反动传单，也有敌视人民民主制度的传单和小册子不断被送到匈牙利来。
    吉亚罗什讲到匈牙利的经济情况时说，政府正在研究三年国民经济计划。1957年的计划已经制定出来，并且正在顺利地实现着。这个计划的主要目标之一是克服困难和弥补反革命叛乱给匈牙利国民经济造成的损害。吉亚罗什指出了苏联和人民民主国家的不可估价的援助，它们给了匈牙利三亿美元的货物、原料和自由外汇。
    这位新闻处长又说，工业生产现在正在顺利恢复中。去年1月份工业总收入为三十六亿零一百万福林，今年1月为二十二亿一千三百万福林；去年2月份为二十九亿八千六百万福林，今年2月份为二十九亿零九百万福林。
    关于匈牙利难民问题，他说，大约有两万难民已经回国。如果西方国家当局不加阻挠，回国的人数还会大大增加。
