	On "New Officials Don't Care About the Affairs of Their Predecessors"
	Zhao Baolin

    In order to strengthen grassroots work, various places have transferred some office cadres to the countryside, and many have taken up fixed positions in agricultural cooperatives. However, it has recently been discovered that some cadres sent down have drawn a circle for their activities—"I'll take care of new things, but not old things." In the Unity Agricultural Cooperative of Dadezhuang Township, Wei County, Hebei Province, last year's final accounts have not yet been completed, and the comrade who was sent down to serve as the director of the cooperative has refused to take care of it on the grounds that "this is the old business of the previous 'official'." What is the result of doing this? The result is that the masses are dissatisfied with the cooperative, and their enthusiasm for production is diminished.

    Generally, cadres sent down will feel that there are more problems in agricultural cooperatives and that they are more complex. There are new problems, and there are old problems; some problems are unfamiliar to them, and not something that one person can solve quickly. However, they should not avoid these problems, but should enthusiastically study and help solve them. Some matters left over from the past that the cooperative needs to resolve and that the members are concerned about should be taken up and managed well. Of course, in specific solutions, it may be necessary to find some of the parties involved to participate and assist, which may be more troublesome. However, simply ignoring it because it is troublesome is a style of being detached from the masses and detached from reality.

    If you don't take care of the past, you can't take care of the present. The problems of agricultural cooperatives are intertwined and mutually influential. The members' worries are born on the final accounts. They don't understand how this new collective matter was managed last year, whether there are any unclear things inside. They are not at ease. Therefore, it is difficult to concentrate on production wholeheartedly. How can the new "official" mobilize everyone to engage in production wholeheartedly while isolating and discarding the worries that exist in their hearts? Is going to the countryside really for the sake of being an "official"?

    谈“新任官不管前任事”	　　赵保林
    为了加强基层工作，各地都把一些机关干部调到农村去了，许多人并且在农业社中担任了固定职务。可是最近发现有个别放下去的干部，给自己的活动划定了个圈圈——“新事我管，旧事我不管”。河北省蔚县大德庄乡团结农业社里，去年的决算至今还没做出，放下来担任社主任的同志就以“这是前任‘官’的旧事”为理由而不管。这样作的结果是什么呢？是群众对社不满，生产情绪消沉。
    一般派下去的干部，都会感到农业社里的问题比较多，也比较复杂。有新的问题，也有旧的问题；有的问题是自己不熟悉的，也不是一个人可以很快就能解决的。但是，决不该回避这些问题，而应该热情地去研究和帮助解决这些问题。有些过去遗留的事情既然也是社里需要解决，而又为社员所关心的，就应该抓起来管好。当然，在具体解决的时候，也许需要找一些当事人共同参加协助，办起来可能会比较麻烦。但是，仅仅因为麻烦而不管，也就是一种脱离群众脱离实际的作风。
    不管过去的事情，也就不能管好现在的事情。农业社的问题都是相互交错相互影响的。社员们的疙瘩生在决算账目上，他们不了解去年这个新的大家务究竟管的怎么样，里边有没有不清楚的事情，他们不放心，因此，很难一心一意安心生产。新“官”又怎么能孤立的动员大家一心从事生产，而把存在心上的疙瘩丢掉呢？难道到农村去工作真是为了做“官”吗？
