    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 14th: The United States State Department submitted a note to the Japanese government on the 13th, rejecting Japan's demand to cancel the U.S. nuclear explosion test to be held in Nevada. The note emphasized that the U.S. wants to strengthen its so-called atomic "deterrent force," and stubbornly insisted that the Nevada test would not cause harmful atomic radiation effects.
    The United States Atomic Energy Commission invited observers and journalists from forty-seven countries on the 10th to visit this test, which is scheduled to be held this month. The invited countries are mainly member states of organizations such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, the Baghdad Pact, and the Inter-American Defense Board, as well as Japan, South Korea, South Vietnam, and Kuomintang elements from Taiwan.

    美国拒绝日本的合理要求
    硬要在内华达州试验核爆炸
    据新华社14日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务院13日向日本政府提出照会，拒绝了日本提出的关于取消美国将在内华达州举行的核爆炸试验的要求。照会强调美国要加强它的所谓原子“遏制力量”，并且硬说内华达州的试验不会造成有害的原子放射影响。
    美国政府原子能委员会10日邀请四十七个国家派观察员和记者参观定于本月内举行的这次试验。被邀请的国家主要是北大西洋公约、东南亚条约、巴格达条约和泛美防务委员会等组织的成员国，此外还有日本、南朝鲜、南越和台湾国民党分子。
