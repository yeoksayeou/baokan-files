    Telegram of Congratulations from the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress
    To the People's Committee of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region:
    On the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the establishment of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, we extend our warm congratulations to you, and through you, to the people of all ethnic groups in the Autonomous Region.
    In the past ten years, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has not only victoriously completed the democratic reforms, but has also achieved great accomplishments in the cause of socialist transformation and socialist construction, thereby fundamentally changing the face of Inner Mongolia. We firmly believe that the people of all ethnic groups in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region will further strengthen their unity and achieve even greater accomplishments in the great cause of building the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and jointly building the great socialist motherland.
    Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, April 27, 1957
