    Jiangsu Engineers, Including Yan Deye, Voice Sharp Criticism: Some Leading Organs Take the Lead in Undermining the Principle of Thrift

    (Our report) Nanjing, May 24 - At a forum held by the Jiangsu Provincial People's Committee with engineers, engineers sharply criticized some leading organs for undermining the state's principles of thrift in urban construction.

    Yan Deye, an engineer at the Urban Construction Department, said: "Urban construction must ensure quality and be thrifty. However, the extent to which construction costs should be reduced is a problem. The phenomenon of 'gusts of wind' in urban construction is very serious. I don't know where the 'big roof' wind came from, so everywhere there are big roofs. Now, the call is to reduce construction standards, so there is a general call to build bungalows and thatched sheds. The central government stipulates that the construction cost is 60 yuan per cubic meter, the province stipulates 50 yuan, and the city only 40 yuan. How can the quality of the project be guaranteed with such layer-by-layer deduction of construction costs?"

    Engineer Yan Deye continued: "If you ask why many systems in urban construction are not implemented firmly and thoroughly, I think it is because the central and provincial leading organs first 'take the lead' in undermining the system. The central government calls for saving steel, but the central system units in Nanjing are the first to waste steel in large quantities. Buildings that do not need steel are forced to be designed to use steel. When we raised objections, they would put big labels on us, saying 'the ministry approved it'. A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army wanted to build a director's room, but at the same time specified that it should be designed like an opera house. The nature of an opera house and a director's room are different, and the materials used are naturally different. When we raised objections, they said, 'The Navy Department decided that there is wood if you want wood, and steel if you want steel.'" The Nanjing City decided to build a reservoir outside the Central Gate, and the mayor also said: "It doesn't matter if you spend more money, and it doesn't matter if you use more steel." The regulations on reducing construction costs seem to be unopposed, but when we build ordinary dormitories for the relevant departments and bureaus in the province, it is not okay without flush toilets, and they get angry and say, "Why build such a broken house!"

    Leading organs, with the "privilege" of controlling raw materials, casually undermine national policies, causing great waste. The province decided to build an open-air stage in Xuanwu Lake that can accommodate 20,000 people. It is said that it was used to welcome a foreign song and dance troupe to Nanjing, so the city arranged it as an urgent political task. Under this circumstance, this stage only needs to be a temporary building, and it is also very unsafe to build a stage that can accommodate 20,000 people in Xuanwu Lake with water on both sides, because there is only one exit. However, the leadership did not agree, and now it is building something that seems like a permanent building and also like a temporary building, which is neither fish nor fowl. Recently, I heard that the song and dance troupe may not come, which is really a waste of money and manpower. I don’t know which leading cadre in Nanjing City had a whim and decided to build a square on Rehe Road. Without consulting the Construction Department in advance, many private houses were demolished. Later, it was found that the foundation was not good, but the "smart" leading comrade said: "The houses have been demolished. It is bad for the political impact if the square is not built," so it must be built.

    Engineer Yun Xin'an said: "Now, in urban construction, the Party Committee leads the technology. As long as the Party Committee decides, the opinions of the urban construction department are not taken into account at all. Some time ago, I went to Changshu City and heard that they were preparing to open a new road and build a large bridge, so they had to demolish more than 100 private houses. We felt it was unnecessary and repeatedly sent people to persuade and mobilize, explaining the advantages and disadvantages, but 'local enthusiasm was very high', and they also said that the private houses had been mobilized and arranged, and the Municipal Party Committee had already approved it. The Party Committee approved it, and the construction department could not object at all. I think, now the province is delegating powers, and the power of basic construction should also be delegated. After the power is delegated, we can't manage it anymore. I hope the leadership will carefully study how much power is appropriate to delegate, otherwise the consequences will be unimaginable." Engineer Cui Zongyi said: "Now the leadership is determined to delegate the power of basic construction, which is good, but as far as I know: in the past, the county only had the power to decide on basic construction worth 10,000 yuan, but after the power of basic construction is delegated, the county Party Committee can decide on funds of three or five million. Suddenly, it has increased hundreds of times. The following is not prepared and lacks experience. I am afraid that this will not be good."

    Engineer Tang Changhao of the Urban Construction Department said: "Now, the phenomenon of many basic construction construction units automatically modifying drawings is very common, which makes our designers laugh and cry. The wards we designed for the Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine were originally stipulated to be painted white, but now they are all painted black. Some people also say: This is a national feature (most of the houses in the countryside have black walls facing outwards). It is very unsuitable to use a dark house as a ward. The buildings of the Forestry Institute have also been changed beyond recognition, and the two completely different architectural styles of Chinese and Western have been mixed on one building. It is really amazing."

### 江苏省严德业等工程师提出尖锐批评  有些领导机关带头破坏节约原则

    江苏省严德业等工程师提出尖锐批评
    有些领导机关带头破坏节约原则
    本报讯　5月24日，在江苏省人民委员会召开的工程师座谈会上，工程师们对有些领导机关破坏国家城市建设节约原则提出了尖锐的批评。
    城市建设厅工程师严德业说：城市建筑一方面要保证质量，一方面要节约，可是建筑造价要降低到什么程度是个问题。城市建设工作中一阵风的现象十分严重，不知什么地方吹来了大屋顶之风，于是处处都是大屋顶，现在提出降低建筑标准，就普遍号召造平房、茅棚。中央规定建筑造价是：每立方公尺六十元，省里规定五十元，市里只有四十元，这样层层克扣建筑造价，如何保证工程质量呢？
    严德业工程师接着说：如果要问，城市建设中的许多制度为什么贯彻得不坚决、不彻底？我觉得这是因为中央和省的领导机关首先“带头”破坏了制度。中央号召节约钢材，可是中央系统在南京的单位首先在大量浪费钢材。不必要用钢材的建筑也硬逼着我们设计成使用钢材。我们提出意见时，他们就用大帽子扣，说“部里批准了”。解放军某部要建筑一个导演室，同时却又指明要设计得像歌剧院一样。歌剧院和导演室性质不同，使用材料自然也不同，当我们提出意见时，他们却说：“是海军部决定的，要木料有木料，要钢材有钢材”。南京市决定在中央门外建造一个水库，市长也说：“多用点钱不在乎，多用点钢不要紧”。降低建筑造价的规定好像是没有人反对的，可是我们替省里有关厅、局建造普通宿舍时，没有抽水马桶就不行，还发脾气说：“为什么要造这样的破房子！”
    领导机关有了掌握原材料的“特权”，就随便破坏国家政策，造成很大的浪费。省里决定在玄武湖造一个能容纳两万人的露天舞台，据说是为了迎接一个外国歌舞团来宁演出时用，所以市里当一个紧急的政治任务布置下来。按照这种情况，这个舞台只要建一个临时性建筑就行了，而且在二面有水的玄武湖内造一个能容纳二万人的舞台也是很不安全的，因为出口只有一个，可是领导上不答应，现在是建了一个好像永久性建筑也像临时性建筑的东西，弄得非牛非马。最近听说，这个歌舞团不一定来了，真是劳民伤财。南京市不知那位领导干部心血来潮，决定在热河路造一个广场，事先没有和建设厅商量，就拆了许多民房，后来发现基础不行，可是“聪明”的领导同志却说：“房子已拆掉了，不修建广场，政治影响不好”，还是要建。
    工程师恽新安说：现在城市建设中是党委领导技术，只要党委决定了，城市建设部门的意见根本不放在眼里。前些时候我到常熟市去，听说他们准备要新开一条马路，修一座大桥，因此必须拆掉一百多间民房。我们觉得没有必要，再三派人去说服动员，说明利弊，可是“地方积极性很高”，还说民房都动员安排好了，而且市委已经批准了。党委批准了，建设部门根本不能反对。我想，现在省里正在下放职权，基本建设权也要下放，职权下放之后，我们更管不到了，希望领导上好好研究一下放多少权比较合适，不然后果不可设想。崔宗彝工程师说：现在领导决心下放基本建设职权，这是好的，但是据我知道：过去县里只有决定一万元的基本建设权，而基建权下放之后，县委可以决定三、五百万的资金，忽然一下子增加了几百倍，下面没有准备，缺乏经验，这样做恐怕不会有好处的。
    城市建设厅工程师汤昌镐说：现在许多基本建设施工单位自动修改图纸的现象很普遍，弄得我们设计人员哭笑不得。我们替省中医院设计的病房，本来规定是白色粉刷，现在全部粉刷成黑色，有人还说：这是民族特色（农村中的民房朝外的墙大多是黑色的），漆黑一团的房子当病房是十分不适合的。林学院的房子也被改得不三不四，竟把中、西二种完全不同的建筑风格混在一幢建筑物上，真是无奇不有。
