    Random Notes on Watching "Ten O'Clock on National Day"
    Qin Zhen
    I watched the film "Ten O'Clock on National Day" with my niece, Youhua. She's a clever Young Pioneer, and watching movies with her has its benefits: she reacts to almost every plot point in the film, and her reactions often spark my interest in further reflection on the film.
    As soon as the film started, it quickly captivated her. She watched intently, only occasionally telling me what she liked or disliked, or asking questions. When the film showed the detectives Gu Qun and Xiao Yu discussing and concluding that there must be some intrinsic connection between the letter thrown by the spy and the car accident, she said to me with a triumphant, somewhat insightful expression, using a literary term she had just learned: "Uncle, does this depiction show that they are very experienced?" I grunted in agreement, but then added, "It also shows that the spies are too inexperienced!" She smiled, obviously not understanding what I meant.
    The spies were indeed too inexperienced. What necessity was there for them to connect throwing the letter, sabotaging the car, stealing the watch, preparing for the explosion, and so on, all within a short period of time? If stealing the watch was necessary for installing the time bomb, then throwing the letter, etc., could have been done at other times, without having to expose traces of their actions in all aspects at the same time. But the spies did just that, which makes one feel that what is depicted in the film doesn't seem like the real actions of cunning, vicious spies, but rather some unreal plots and clues fabricated by the author to smoothly solve the "Double Bell Horseshoe Watch" case later. These false plots precisely negate the idea that Youhua put forward earlier: because the spies are too incompetent, and the clues are obtained too easily, it fails to profoundly show the detectives' resourcefulness, and it also fails to fully reflect the complexity and difficulty of detective work.
    The last scene of the film appeared: on the morning of National Day, the square was full of people. In Zhang Dali's home, not far from the square, appeared the horseshoe watch that had been stolen by the spy. People knew that the spy had installed a highly explosive device inside the watch, which would explode at ten o'clock; but the detectives, however, were still interrogating the spy He Zhanbiao, asking him: "Where is that horseshoe watch now?"
    When Youhua saw this, she was really anxious. She squeezed my hand tightly, constantly stomping her feet and saying, "Hurry up! Hurry up!" She hoped that the detective uncle would hurry up and take away the watch with the bomb! When the little friend Yuanyuan became anxious and wanted to turn the watch faster, she cried out anxiously, "Don't! Don't!" ...
    The author has quite successfully used the technique of film montage here, winding the "spring" in the audience's heart tighter and tighter. He intersperses the scenes of interrogating the spy with the scenes in the square, and repeatedly uses close-up shots to emphasize the "bomb-laden" horseshoe watch, as if saying to the audience: "Please pay attention to this watch!" "The spy hasn't said anything yet!" ... In this way, the audience, like Youhua, is firmly gripped. However, to be honest, I wasn't nervous at the time. I just didn't want to disappoint Youhua, so I didn't say things like "Don't worry, it's okay!" Although, I'm not smarter than her (just have a little more life experience), but I knew that the explosives in the watch had already been taken out. Since the detective Gu Qun had already known that this watch had been stolen by the spy, then even the dumbest detective would have carefully examined the watch that was returned from the spy's hands! So, what was I anxious about!
    Using techniques to create suspense and tension in the audience's mind is possible in any good work. However, techniques should also be based on real plots. If the technique deviates from the real plot, then it is not a real artistic technique, but rather a bit of mystification.
    The film ended, and we returned home. Suddenly, Youhua said to me again, "Uncle, why were those aunties in the movie laughing, making noise, and singing in the car like that?"
    No wonder she asked such a question. The scene of those girls and the driver Ping Xiaohai laughing and making noise really couldn't explain anything. Of course, it is possible to intersperse some love scenes in a film, or even use love descriptions as the main theme. The problem is how to describe it. Is this kind of interspersion necessary or unnecessary? Is it an organic part of the film or an external, rigid branch? I can't see how much good the girls' laughter and noise in "Ten O'Clock on National Day" does to the film. This interspersion has little intrinsic connection with the entire plot, and it has little influence on the character development of the film's protagonists; and that interspersion is so long, laughing, making noise, and singing for a long time, it really makes people clueless. The dances in the "Garden Tour" scene also have similar shortcomings.
    It was time to sleep, and Youhua brought her diary for me to read. It was all about the movie, written with great enthusiasm, and it even infected me, reminding me that the film still has many merits, such as the camera work being relatively clean, and the rhythm being relatively lively, etc.

    看“国庆十点钟”散记
    秦榛
    影片“国庆十点钟”，我是和侄女儿幼华一起看的。她是个机灵的少先队员，和她在一起看电影有个好处：她几乎对影片中每个情节都有反应，而她的反应也常常引起我对影片进一步思考的兴趣。
    影片一开映，很快就吸引住了她。她专心地看着，只是不时地向我说一说她喜欢哪或是不喜欢哪，或是提出些疑问。当影片中侦察员顾群与小余经过商讨，认为特务扔的信与汽车事故之间一定有着某种内在的联系的时候，她便得意地、若有发现地用刚学来的文学术语对我说：“叔，这里的描写，是不是表现他们很有经验？”我不在意地嗯了一声表示同意，但接着我又补充了一句：“这同时也表现出特务太没有经验了！”她听了，笑了一笑，显然并没有了解我的意思。
    特务的确是太没有经验了，他们有什么必要把扔信、破坏汽车、偷表、准备爆炸等等事情连接起来在一个短时间内进行呢？要是说偷表是为了安装定时炸弹而不得不偷的话，那么扔信等等就满可以放在其他时间去进行，没有必要同时在各方面都暴露出行动的痕迹。但是特务们却这样做了，因此就使人感到影片中所描写的，好像并不是狡猾、狠毒的特务的真实行动，而是作者为了以后顺利地破获“双铃马蹄表”案件，而虚拟出的一些不真实的情节和线索。这些虚假的情节正好否定了幼华在前面所提出的那个想法：因为特务太无能了，线索的获得太容易了，因此不能深刻地表现出侦察员们的机智，同时也不能充分地反映出侦察工作的复杂和艰苦。
    影片最后一个情节出现了：国庆日的上午，广场上站满了人。在离广场不远的张大力的家里，出现了那个曾经被特务偷去过的马蹄表。人们知道，特务在这表里面装上了烈性炸药，在十点钟的时候就要爆炸的；但是侦察员呢，却还在审讯特务何占彪，问他：“那个马蹄表，现在在哪儿？”
    幼华看到这里，真是急得要命，她紧捏着我的手，不断地顿着脚说：“快来吧！快来吧！”她希望侦察员叔叔赶快来把那只装有炸药的表拿走！到小朋友圆圆因为心急要把表拨快一点的时候，她便急得叫了起来：“?！别拨，别拨！”……
    作者在这里是相当成功地运用了电影蒙太奇的技巧，一把一把地上紧了观众心里的“弦”的。他把审讯特务的场面和广场上的场面交叉起来，并且三番五次地用特写镜头来强调那只“装有炸药”的马蹄表，似乎在对观众说：“请注意这只表！”“特务还没有说出来！”……这样，就把观众，比如幼华，牢牢地抓往了。不过，说实在话，我当时却并不紧张，我只是因为不愿意使幼华扫兴，才没有对她说“别急，不要紧的！”之类的话。虽然，我并不比她聪明一些（只是比她多一点生活经验而已），但是，我却知道表里面的炸药早就拿出去了。因为侦察员顾群既然早就知道这只表曾经被特务偷去过，那么，即使是最笨的侦察员，对那从特务手中送回来的表，也会作一番详细的检查的！那么，我还着急干什么呢！
    运用技巧，在观众心里造成紧张的悬念，这是在任何好的作品中都可能有的。不过技巧也应该有真实的情节为基础，若果技巧脱离了真实的情节，那就不是真正的艺术技巧，而是有点故弄玄虚。
    影片结束了，回到家里。突然，幼华又对我说：“叔，电影里的那几个阿姨在汽车里又笑又闹又唱，她们干嘛那样呢？”
    难怪她发出这样的疑问，那几个姑娘和司机平小海笑闹的场面，的确是不能说明什么问题的。当然，一部影片中穿插一些爱情场面，甚至以爱情描写为主干，那都是可以的。问题在于如何描写它。这种穿插是必要的呢，还是不必要的？是影片的一个有机的部分呢，还是外加的生硬的枝节？我就看不出
  “国庆十点钟”中姑娘们的笑闹对影片有多大好处。这个穿插与整个剧情是没有多大内在联系的，对影片主人公们的性格发展也是没有多大影响的；而那个穿插又是那么的长，笑呀，闹呀，唱了半天，实在使人不知所云。“游园”那一场中的那些舞蹈，也是有类似的缺点。
    要睡觉了，幼华把她的日记送来给我看。写的都是关于电影的事，写得很热情，甚至感染了我，使我回忆起影片还是有不少可取之处的，譬如镜头比较干净，节奏也比较明快等等。
