Beijing, May 13th (Our Dispatch) "The spring breeze has not yet reached Jianmen Pass," this is the criticism leveled at Sichuan for its current failure to fully open up avenues for public discourse. After Chairman Mao's report was widely conveyed within democratic parties, government organs, schools, and enterprises, and although study sessions were organized and the provincial and municipal Party committees held some discussion meetings to solicit opinions from various sectors, the multiple concerns between leaders and those being led are hindering the development of "letting go" and "contending." Li Zixiang, vice chairman of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK), said: There hasn't been a genuine "letting go" yet. There exists a state of knowing but not speaking, or not speaking fully. Discussions have failed to clearly delineate the boundaries between contradictions with the enemy and contradictions among the people, resulting in reluctance to speak, or speaking superficially, for fear of being labeled as having problems with one's stance or history. He said that the United Front Work Department of the Provincial Party Committee held a symposium on the 10th, attended by thirty or forty people, but the meeting only lasted half a day, and many people who wanted to speak did not have the time, except for a few. This is far behind what's happening in Beijing. Regarding the reasons for insufficient "letting go," Pan Dakui, chairman of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, said: From the perspective of leaders in some units, there is an underestimation of the progress made by intellectuals in recent years, with fears of releasing demons and monsters, poisonous weeds and harmful flowers, and things getting out of control. When a League member wrote an article in a school calling for the elimination of outdated rules and regulations, the Party committee criticized him indiscriminately. He hoped that when "letting go," leading personnel should not casually pour cold water on the masses. Liu Xingyuan, chairman of the Sichuan Provincial Work Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, said: Everyone still has concerns when speaking. To enable everyone to speak freely, help the Party rectify its work style, and improve the relationship between the Party and democratic parties, it is necessary to strengthen the education of Party members in these units on the United Front policy and give full play to the role of democratic parties. Lu Junxiong, a professor at the Chengdu Institute of Physical Education, said: Outdated rules and regulations prevent everyone from speaking freely. Before the "letting go" at this institute, the leadership announced that only correct and appropriate opinions were allowed, to prevent bad elements from taking advantage of the situation. They also drafted regulations for rewards and punishments for faculty and staff, which aroused widespread dissatisfaction among teachers and students. She said that a professor hoped that Sichuan would not just release a few trumpet flowers to herald good news, but would also open up a garden with a riot of colors.

    “春风未渡剑门关”
    四川党外人士批评省内尚未大开言路
    本报成都13日电“春风未渡剑门关”，这是人们对四川当前未充分开放言路的批评。毛主席报告在民主党派、机关、学校、企业普遍传达后，虽然组织了学习，省、市委也开了些座谈会，开始征求各方面意见，但是领导者和被领导者之间的重重顾虑，障碍着放和鸣的开展。民革四川省委副主任委员李紫翔说：现在没有放起来，存在着知有所不言、言有所不尽的状态。讨论中由于没有认真划清敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾的界限，因此不敢谈，轻描淡写地谈，怕谈错了，说是立场、历史有问题。他说，省委统战部10日开过一次座谈会，出席会议的有三、四十人，但时间只有半天，除几个人外很多人想讲话也没有时间。跟北京比较相差很远。对于放不够的原因，民盟四川省委主任委员潘大逵说：从某些单位的领导方面看，因对知识分子几年来的进步估计不足，怕放出牛鬼蛇神，臭花毒草，不可收拾。有个盟员在学校里刚写了要求消除清规戒律的文章，党委就不加区别加以指责。他希望放的时候领导人员不要随便给群众泼冷水。农工民主党四川省工委主任委员刘星垣说：大家现在讲话仍有顾虑，要使大家能畅所欲言，帮助党整风，搞好党与民主党派之间的关系，就应加强对这些单位中的党员进行统战政策教育，发挥民主党派的作用。成都市体育学院教授卢君雄说：清规戒律使大家不能畅所欲言。这个学院在未放之前，领导上就宣布只准提正确的适当的意见，防止坏分子钻空子，同时还拟定了教职员工奖惩条例，引起师生普遍不满。她说，有位教授希望四川不要只放几朵喇叭花，吹个喜临门，也要开个万紫千红。
