Then, it was significantly revised by adopting the opinions of comrades and representatives from various places. During the Congress, individual textual revisions were made based on the opinions of the representatives.

    The Congress conducted the election of the Central Committee of the China Communist Youth League by secret ballot. The list of candidates for the new Central Committee included 149 full members and 63 alternate members. This list was initially proposed by the Presidium of the Congress and various delegations after repeated deliberations and consultations, and then based on the results of the preliminary election. Of the 1,493 delegates attending this Congress, 1,481 participated in today's election.

    Executive Chairman Luo Yi announced the election results at the meeting. He said that a total of 1,481 delegates participated in the election today, and 1,481 ballots were issued and collected. All 149 full members and 63 alternate members on the candidate list were elected with more than half of the votes. After the election results were announced, there was enthusiastic applause throughout the venue.

    Lu Zhao, Deputy Secretary-General of the Congress, announced at the meeting that, as of today, the Congress had received more than 4,000 congratulatory letters from more than 4,000 units and 120,000 people, as well as 25 congratulatory telegrams and 124 congratulatory gifts.

    At today's meeting, 25 more representatives delivered written speeches. Up to this point, a total of 124 representatives had made oral and written speeches at the Congress. In their speeches, they focused on the issue of how the Youth League should conduct ideological education among the vast number of young people in the current new situation, the issue of labor education for young people, how to correctly handle the people's internal contradictions related to young people, and the issue of the construction of the Youth League's grassroots organizations, and extensively exchanged work experiences of the League. In their speeches, in the spirit of promoting democracy, they put forward many criticisms and suggestions for improvement on the work of the Central Committee of the Youth League.
