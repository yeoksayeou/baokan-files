Jiangsu Provincial Education Director Says:
    If Children Fail to Get Into School, They Will Be Helped to Participate in Production
    Wu Tianshi, the director of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education, has two children, Wu Yunpu and Wu Yunhong, who are current graduating students from the junior middle school of Nanjing No. 9 Middle School and the senior high school of Nanjing Normal College Affiliated Middle School. Wu Tianshi said: "Now, I have arranged their future paths. If they fail to get into school, I will help them participate in labor production or self-study." Wu Yunpu said to his father: "The People's Daily editorial 'On the Issue of Middle and Primary School Graduates Participating in Agricultural Production' mentioned the question of learning from 'fools' or learning from 'clever people.' I am very willing to be a 'fool,' and I have already written this belief in my composition book."

    江苏省教育厅长说
    如果孩子考不上学校  就帮助他们参加生产
    江苏省教育厅长吴天石的孩子吴允朴和吴允弘，现在是南京市第九中学初中部和南京师范学院附中高中的应届毕业生。吴天石说：“现在，我已为他们安排好出路，如果考不上学校，就帮助他们参加劳动生产，或者自学。”吴允朴向他的爸爸说：“人民日报‘关于中小学毕业生参加农业生产问题’的社论，曾提到学‘傻子’还是学‘聪明人’的问题，我很乐意做‘傻子’，我已经把这个信念写在我的作文簿上。”
