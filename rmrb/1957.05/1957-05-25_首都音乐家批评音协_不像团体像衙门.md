    Capital Musicians Criticize the Musicians Association
    More Like a Government Office Than an Organization

    (Our Newspaper) News: At a forum convened yesterday by the Chinese Musicians Association, musicians, singers, and conductors from the capital generally reflected that the Musicians Association did not seem like a mass organization, but rather like a government office.

    At the meeting, Lou Qian'gui first stated: The Musicians Association does not seem like a mass organization of musicians themselves, but more like a small government office of the Ministry of Culture; matters that the Ministry of Culture is not comfortable discussing are often spoken by the Musicians Association. Everyone felt that the members of the council were mostly administrative leaders who were very busy and did not have time to care, naturally making it a bureaucratic institution. Pan Yingfeng said: The work of the Musicians Association is detached from the masses, with only a few directors holding meetings, having little connection with 90% of music workers. Everyone felt that there were different levels among members; first were the directors, then the composers, and then others. Wang Fangliang said: After the Music Week last year, although the closed-doorism and sectarianism of the Musicians Association had some improvements, and some new members were developed, it still only emphasized composing and theoretical activities, and rarely cared about other aspects. Situ Huacheng also said: "I am not clear about the obligations and rights of a member. After joining, I only received some movie tickets, viewing tickets, and a copy of 'Music Newsletter'; in addition, I want to do some work for the Musicians Association, but I don't know who to contact, I don't even recognize people." Some people felt that sectarianism was still quite serious in the Musicians Association's work of recruiting members. Pan Yingfeng pointed out that some very young comrades who had just sung a few good songs were members of the Musicians Association; while people who had been engaged in music work for ten or twenty years were rejected. Fang Songfu felt that the sectarianism of the Musicians Association was also manifested in the disunity of leading cadres, especially the criticism of He Luting after Music Week, which was not an artistic discussion, but close to a personal attack.

    Attendees at the forum also expressed dissatisfaction with the publishing work led by the Musicians Association. They reflected that almost no one subscribed to "People's Music." Situ Huacheng said: "People's Music" is too boring and does not help the business of the actors. Jin Zhengping believes that "People's Music" seems to only publish two kinds of articles, one is absolutely correct, and the other is absolutely wrong. They believe that actors have the deepest understanding of the quality of works, and music publishers should approach and understand the situation of actors more, so as to avoid some books being printed a lot and piled up there unsold.

    Situ Zhiwen also criticized the Musicians Association for doing very little popularization work in recent years and hoped that the Musicians Association could organize members to do more guidance work in the future to promote the development of the music industry.

### 首都音乐家批评音协  不像团体像衙门

    首都音乐家批评音协
    不像团体像衙门
    本报讯　首都的演奏家、歌唱家、指挥家在中国音乐家协会昨天邀集的座谈会上，普遍反映音协不像是群众团体，却像个衙门。
    在会上，楼乾贵首先认为：音协不像是音乐家自己的群众性的组织，倒像是文化部的小衙门；文化部不好讲的话，常常由音协来讲。大家觉得理事会的成员大多是行政领导干部，工作很忙，没有时间来关心，自然成了一个官僚主义的机构。潘英锋说：音协的工作脱离群众，只是少数理事在开开会，同90％的音乐工作者没有多大关系。大家感到会员有等级之分；首先是理事，其次是作曲家，然后才是其他的人。王方亮说：去年音乐周以后，音协的关门主义、宗派主义虽有了若干改进，发展了一些新会员，但仍然只重视作曲和理论活动，对其他方面很少关心。司徒华城也说：“我对会员的义务和权利就不明确。入了会以后，只收到一些电影票、观摩票和一份音乐通讯；此外，想为音协做些工作，却不知道找谁，连人也不认得。”有的人感到音协在吸收会员的工作上，宗派主义仍是相当严重的。潘英锋指出，有些很年轻的同志刚唱出几首好歌，就是音协的会员；而一、二十年从事音乐工作的人倒被拒在门外。方崧甫觉得音协的宗派主义还表现在领导干部不团结上，特别是音乐周以后对贺绿汀的批评，不是艺术上的探讨，近乎人身攻击。
    出席座谈会的人，对音协领导的出版工作也表示不满。他们反映，差不多都没有订“人民音乐”，司徒华城说：“人民音乐”太枯燥，对演员的业务也没有帮助。金正平认为“人民音乐”好像只登二种文章，一种是绝对正确的，一种是绝对错误的。他们认为作品的好坏，演员的感受最深，音乐出版社应该多和演员接近、了解情况，免得有的书印了许多堆在那里卖不出去。
    司徒志文还批评音协这几年来对普及工作做得很少，希望音协今后能够组织会员多做些辅导工作，来推动音乐事业的发展。
