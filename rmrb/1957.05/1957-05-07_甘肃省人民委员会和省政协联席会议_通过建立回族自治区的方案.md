Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, May 5th. The Gansu Provincial People's Committee and the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) held a joint meeting from the 2nd to the 3rd of May, discussing and approving the plan proposed by the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), based on the CPC Central Committee's initiative, to establish a Hui Autonomous Region in the northeastern part of Gansu Province.

One hundred and forty-two people attended the meeting, including members of the Gansu Provincial People's Committee, members of the Gansu Provincial Committee of the CPPCC, and other relevant individuals. Governor Deng Baoshan chaired the meeting.

After hearing the plan presented by Meng Dingjun, Director of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Gansu Provincial Committee, on behalf of the Provincial Party Committee, proposing the establishment of the Hui Autonomous Region with the Yinchuan Special District, the two Hui Autonomous Prefectures of Wuzhong and Guyuan, and the Jingyuan Hui Autonomous County and Longde County, the meeting held discussions. All speakers agreed with the initiative of the CPC Central Committee and the plan proposed by the Gansu Provincial Party Committee. Finally, the meeting unanimously approved the plan and will promptly report it to the State Council.

This plan was derived from several plans proposed by various parties after repeated consultation and research. According to this plan, the autonomous region will include nineteen counties and cities, with a population of approximately 1.6 million, of which the Hui people account for more than one-third. The area of the autonomous region is approximately 75,000 square kilometers.

The meeting considered that although this plan has shortcomings, it is relatively realistic and feasible. The areas included in this plan are contiguous, and the Hui population is relatively concentrated and accounts for a considerable proportion of the total population in the region, which will be more convenient for exercising the right to autonomy after the establishment of the autonomous region. At the same time, the development conditions in terms of economy and culture in the autonomous region are also very good.

This meeting was convened after the Hui and Han people, both inside and outside the Party in Gansu Province, had conducted multiple and thorough consultations and deliberations on the issue of establishing a Hui Autonomous Region. Prior to this, based on the initiative of the CPC Central Committee, the Gansu Provincial Party Committee successively invited more than 1,700 Hui and Han people to conduct symposiums and discussions, extensively listening to opinions from all sides. The Provincial Party Committee also conducted multiple special studies. On April 29th, the Gansu Provincial Committee of the CPPCC also held a special meeting to discuss this issue.

Wang Feng, Deputy Minister of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee and Deputy Director of the State Nationalities Affairs Commission, participated in the meeting and delivered a speech on the establishment of the Hui Autonomous Region and the ethnic relations in Gansu Province before and after liberation. In his speech, he also answered some relevant questions raised by the Hui and Han people.

Zhang Zhongliang, First Secretary of the CPC Gansu Provincial Committee, said in his speech that the national Hui population is more than 3.5 million, and Gansu has more than 1.1 million, accounting for about one-third. Although the residential characteristics of the Hui population in Gansu Province are the same as those of the whole country, with large dispersion and small concentration, the Hui population in the Yinchuan Special District, the two Hui Autonomous Prefectures of Wuzhong and Guyuan, is relatively concentrated, and it is appropriate to choose this area to establish an autonomous region. He said that after social reform in this area, ethnic relations have been established on the basis of socialism. In rural areas, thousands of ethnic joint cooperatives and single-ethnic cooperatives have emerged. Some industrial enterprises have been established, and Yinchuan, Wuzhong, and Guyuan all have a number of small factories and mines. Hui cadres have also grown up. This shows that the conditions for establishing a Hui Autonomous Region are ripe. Some people mentioned that since social reform has been basically completed and a relationship of unity and friendship has been established between ethnic groups, there is no need to establish an autonomous region. Zhang Zhongliang said that the establishment of a Hui Autonomous Region not only embodies the Party's policy of ethnic regional autonomy, but also helps to mobilize the enthusiasm of the Hui people in Gansu Province and the Hui people across the country; and also helps to mobilize the enthusiasm of all ethnic minorities in the country. This measure will have a very profound political impact domestically.

Zhang Zhongliang proposed to strengthen publicity work before the establishment of the autonomous region. During publicity, the account of ethnic killings between the Hui and Han people should be attributed to the reactionary rulers, pointing out that ethnic killings were the result of incitement by reactionary rule. At the same time, it is necessary to explain that the people of all ethnic groups in our country jointly created the great motherland in a considerable historical period, and the people of all ethnic groups have made beneficial contributions in the development of the motherland's economy and culture and in the successive revolutionary struggles; and to point out the benefits of mutual learning and common prosperity among ethnic groups. In addition, publicity should recognize the differences between ethnic groups. There are differences in ethnic customs, lifestyles, psychological states, and employment patterns. Recognizing these differences will enable us to take care of these differences and make ethnic unity even better.

Governor Deng Baoshan spoke at the end, expressing complete agreement with the plan proposed by the Provincial Party Committee. He called for strengthening publicity and education work for the Hui and Han people, and asked all attendees to conduct this publicity widely and actively. (Picture attached)

### 甘肃省人民委员会和省政协联席会议  通过建立回族自治区的方案

    甘肃省人民委员会和省政协联席会议
    通过建立回族自治区的方案
    新华社兰州5日电　甘肃省人民委员会、政协甘肃省委员会2日到3日举行联席会议，讨论通过了中共甘肃省委员会根据中共中央的倡议提出的在甘肃省东北部地区建立回族自治区的方案。
    出席这次会议的有甘肃省人民委员会委员、政协甘肃省委员会委员和其他有关人士一百四十二人。会议由邓宝珊省长主持。
    会议在听了中共甘肃省委员会统一战线工作部部长蒙定军代表省委提出的以银川专区、吴忠、固原两个回族自治州和泾源回族自治县、隆德县建立回族自治区的方案以后，进行了讨论。所有发言的人都同意中共中央的倡议和甘肃省委提出的方案，最后会议一致通过了这个方案，并将迅速呈报国务院。
    这个方案是经过反复协商研究，从各方面提出的几个方案中选择得出的。按照这个方案，自治区将包括十九个县、市；人口约有一百六十多万，其中回族占三分之一以上；自治区的面积约为七万五千多平方公里。
    会议认为，这个方案虽然有缺点，但比较现实易行。这个方案所包括的地区互相毗连，回族人口比较集中并在全区人口中占有相当比例，这在自治区成立后在行使自治权利方面比较便利。同时，自治区在经济文化方面的发展条件也是很好的。
    这次会议是在甘肃省党内外回、汉族人士就建立回族自治区问题进行了多次充分的协商酝酿以后召开的。在这以前，甘肃省委根据中共中央的倡议，先后邀请一千七百多位回、汉族人士进行座谈讨论，广泛听取各方面的意见，省委并进行过多次专门研究。4月29日，政协甘肃省委员会也开会专门讨论了这个问题。
    中共中央统一战线工作部副部长、中央民族事务委员会副主任汪锋参加了这次会议，并且就建立回族自治区和甘肃省解放前后的民族关系问题作了发言。他在发言中还分别解答了回、汉族人士提出的一些有关问题。
    中共甘肃省委员会第一书记张仲良在会上发言说，全国回族人口三百五十多万，甘肃有一百一十多万，约占三分之一。甘肃省回族人口居住特点虽然和全国一样，是大分散、小集中，但银川专区、吴忠、固原两回族自治州回族人口比较集中，选择这一地区成立自治区是适宜的。他说，这一地区经过社会改革以后，民族关系已经建立在社会主义的基础上。在农村中出现了数以千计的民族联合社和单一民族社。建立了一些工业企业，银川、吴忠、固原都有了一批小型厂矿。回族干部也成长起来了。这说明建立回族自治区的条件成熟了。有人提到既然社会改革已经基本完成，民族间已经建立了团结友爱关系，就不必再成立自治区。张仲良说，建立回族自治区不仅是体现了党的民族区域自治政策，而且有利于调动甘肃省回族人民和全国回族人民的积极性；而且有利于调动全国所有少数民族的积极性。这一措施将在国内造成很深刻的政治影响。
    张仲良提出在自治区成立前要加强宣传工作，在宣传时要把回、汉族人民之间的民族仇杀这一笔账划到反动统治者的身上，指明民族仇杀是反动统治挑拨离间的结果。同时要阐明我国各民族人民在相当长的历史时期中共同缔造了伟大的祖国，各族人民在发展祖国的经济、文化方面在历次的革命斗争中都作了有益的贡献；指明各民族间取长补短，共同繁荣的好处。此外，应在宣传时承认民族之间有差别性，民族间的风俗习惯、生活方式、心理状态、就业方式等是有差别的。承认这些差别，就能照顾这些差别，使民族团结做得更好。
    邓宝珊省长最后发言，表示完全同意省委提出的方案。他要求对回、汉族人民加强宣传教育工作，要求所有到会的人士广泛地、积极地进行这一宣传。（附图片）
