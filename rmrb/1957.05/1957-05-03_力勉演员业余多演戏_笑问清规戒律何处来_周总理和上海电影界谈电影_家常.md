Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 2nd. Premier Zhou Enlai cordially discussed movies "like family matters" with more than sixty film workers in Shanghai on the evening of April 28th. Premier Zhou was very concerned about film work. He said to everyone, "It's a pity that my Premier's job doesn't have an A/B system like actors' performances. Otherwise, I would personally like to do odd jobs for you." The Premier was familiar with many people in the film industry. When he saw Gu Yelu, he smiled and said to him, "You are still so young!"

During the four hours of lively and enthusiastic conversation, everyone spoke freely and raised many issues currently in film work. Premier Zhou's witty remarks made everyone excited and full of confidence.

Talking about film production, Premier Zhou said: There are indeed many outdated rules and regulations. For example, many Chinese newsreels are filmed very rigidly. The Premier's activities in the films are either speeches or handshakes. He smiled and said to everyone, "This question should be asked of you. No one has ordered that this is not good to film, or that is not good to film. Why is it limited to filming speeches and handshakes? Why are there so many outdated rules and regulations?"

Film director Zheng Junli talked about how the film industry should not only continue to add new actors, but also tap the potential of existing actors. Older actors can also play younger roles through superb acting skills and makeup. If the potential of existing actors is not tapped, new ones will also be "backlogged." The Premier applauded in agreement and cited famous foreign actors to illustrate that this view was correct. Someone mentioned that adding gauze in front of the camera used to make older actors look younger, but after liberation this method was also abandoned, saying it was a bourgeois technique. The Premier found this very laughable. He believed that some good methods from before liberation should be used more and should not be abandoned. The Premier was very concerned about the actors' performances and said that theatrical performances in Beijing were more active than in Shanghai. He very much approved of film actors performing more in theatrical plays in their spare time and hoped that relevant departments would help them solve the problem of performance theaters as soon as possible. Factory director Chen Liting talked about the current need to cultivate some young actors and technicians. When the Premier heard him say that the young cadres being trained are now called "technical assistants," he said: It is not necessary to add any titles to cultivate young people, otherwise it will foster complacency among young people and there will be no benefits. Many of our artists were apprentices when they were young and suffered a lot before they developed their skills. The Premier very much agreed with the method of cultivating young people by taking on apprentices. Finally, the Premier encouraged the personnel of the Shanghai Film Studio to work hard, communicate with each other, support each other, and compete with each other after the split of the factory. Premier Zhou carefully recorded the questions and opinions raised by everyone and prepared to take them to Beijing for further study.

Premier Zhou's conversation has been widely circulated in the Shanghai film industry, making everyone feel excited and encouraged.

    力勉演员业余多演戏  笑问清规戒律何处来
    周总理和上海电影界谈电影“家常”
    新华社上海2日电  周总理在4月28日晚上和上海六十多位电影工作者亲切地谈电影“家常”。周总理十分关怀电影工作，他向大家说：“可惜我的总理工作不像演员演戏有AB制，不然的话，我愿亲自给你们打打杂。”总理对电影界的许多人都很熟悉，当他看到顾也鲁时，笑着对他说：“你还这么年轻！”
    在四小时活泼、热烈的交谈中，大家畅所欲言，提出了目前电影工作中的许多问题。周总理饶有风趣的发言使大家兴致勃勃，信心倍增。
    谈到电影的摄制工作，周总理说：清规戒律的确很多，譬如中国许多新闻纪录片拍摄得很呆板，影片中总理的活动不是讲演就是握手。他笑着对大家说：“这问题应该问问你们，谁也没有下命令说这不好拍，那不好拍，为什么只限于拍讲演、握手呢？为什么要有这许多清规戒律呢？”
    电影导演郑君里谈到电影界除了要继续补充新演员外，还应发挥现在演员的潜力，年纪比较大的演员也可以通过精湛的演技和化装，来表演年轻角色，如果现有演员的潜力不加发挥，新的进来也会“积压”。总理听了鼓掌表示赞成，并且还举了国外著名演员来说明这种见解是正确的。有人提到从前在镜头前加纱可以使年龄较大的演员显得年轻，可是解放后这个办法也被废弃不用，说这是资产阶级手法。总理听了觉得很可笑，他认为解放前一些好的办法应多加运用，不应废弃。总理很关心演员的演出，说北京话剧演出比上海活跃，他很赞成电影演员在业余多演话剧，希望有关部门及早帮助他们解决演出剧场问题。陈鲤庭厂长谈到目前需要培养一些青年演员和技师，当总理听他说现在把培养的青年干部称做“技术助理”时说：培养青年人不一定要加什么头衔，不然就会滋长年轻人的自满，没有什么好处，我们的许多艺术家小时候都是当学徒，吃了不少苦才把本事练出来的。总理很赞成用带徒弟的方法培养年轻人。总理最后勉励上海电影制片公司的人员，分厂后，努力工作、互通声气、互相支援、互相竞赛。周总理并把大家提出的问题和意见仔细地记录下来，准备带到北京去加以研究。
    周总理这次的谈话，已在上海电影界广泛流传开来。使大家感到兴奋和鼓舞。
