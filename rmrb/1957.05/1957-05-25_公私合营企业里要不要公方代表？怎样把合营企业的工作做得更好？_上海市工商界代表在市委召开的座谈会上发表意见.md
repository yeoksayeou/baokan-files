Should There Be Public Representatives in Joint Public-Private Enterprises?
    How to Improve the Work of Joint Ventures?
    Representatives of Shanghai's Industrial and Commercial Circles Expressed Their Opinions at a Symposium Held by the Municipal Party Committee
    (Our Newspaper Shanghai, May 24th, Reporter Xi Ping) Should there be public representatives in joint public-private enterprises? How can the work of joint public-private enterprises be further improved on the existing basis? Representatives of Shanghai's industrial and commercial circles expressed their opinions at a symposium held by the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China yesterday afternoon.

    Zhu Hongyi said: Leadership from public representatives is unimaginable. The public and private parties should respect each other.

    Many representatives disagreed with the idea of withdrawing public representatives from joint public-private enterprises. Zhu Hongyi, private manager of Zhonghe Paper Mill, said humorously at the meeting: "I am a capitalist. When I first arrived in Shanghai, I was penniless. It's not like I didn't have any skill when I became a capitalist in Shanghai, a place filled with temptation. Before the joint venture, I tried to stimulate workers' enthusiasm for labor and improve the labor productivity of the enterprise by using methods such as bonuses and excess bonuses. I tried everything, but I could not achieve my goal. However, after the enterprise became a joint venture, as soon as the public representative arrived at the factory and mobilized the masses of workers to engage in production, the output quickly increased from 200 tons of paper per month in the past to 300 tons." He also said: Although the enterprise is now a joint venture, it is not yet a completely socialist enterprise, and the enterprise and people still need to undergo profound transformation. These tasks are unimaginable without the leadership of public representatives. Zhu Hongyi also said: At present, the salaries of private personnel are generally higher, and they also have fixed interest; although the income of employees has greatly improved compared with before liberation, due to limited national financial and material resources, it is impossible to provide very good material welfare. This often creates internal contradictions in the enterprise. This contradiction must also rely on public representatives to adjust. He said: I think that most public representatives work hard for the enterprise after arriving at the factory; the shortcoming is that they do not give enough play to and utilize the talents of the private party. Public representatives manage everything, but people don't know everything, which is like "pushing a mill with a stone mortar on your head." He suggested that both the public and private parties in joint public-private enterprises should love the enterprise, respect each other, and have responsibilities and rights.

    Sun Ding said: Higher authorities should help public representatives improve their political level; private personnel should cultivate the feeling of "laying down the butcher knife and becoming a Buddha on the spot."

    Sun Ding, deputy manager of Shanghai Rotating Electrical Machinery Company, also expressed his views on this issue. He said: The public factory director definitely cannot be withdrawn, but the higher leading organs must help the public representatives improve their political level. Many public representatives in Shanghai were sent down after the upsurge of joint public-private ventures. Many of them were activists in previous movements after liberation. They have rich experience in class struggle and are often accustomed to treating the private personnel in the current enterprise in the same way they treated capitalists in the past; these comrades often hold multiple positions and have no time to study. They cannot see the new changes in class relations, so they fall behind the new situation and hinder the development of socialist transformation. Therefore, political and ideological education must be strengthened for these comrades. He also said: At present, some private personnel have a very serious sense of inferiority. I think private personnel should cultivate the feeling of "laying down the butcher knife and becoming a Buddha on the spot" and not learn to be "Wu Dalang," thinking that they are inferior to others everywhere. He said: Most of the private personnel are working enthusiastically, and I hope the government and the Party will not treat them as outsiders.

    Liu Jingji and Chen Mingshan believe that private personnel can be allowed to take charge under certain conditions.

    Liu Jingji, deputy director of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association, said: I cannot agree with the statement made by some representatives of industrial and commercial circles in Tianjin that public representatives should be withdrawn. However, individual enterprises with conditions, such as private personnel who are virtuous and talented, a sound internal democratic management committee, strong Party committee leadership, and business work under the unified planning of professional companies, can also allow private personnel to exercise their abilities. In this way, from a positive perspective, a group of public representatives can be drawn to more important positions, and a group of cadres can be trained for the country at the same time.

    Chen Mingshan, deputy manager of Shanghai Pharmaceutical Company, said: Enterprise joint ventures and public representatives going to factories are indeed of great benefit to enterprise transformation. However, after a period of enterprise joint ventures, private personnel who can rely on the masses of workers and have the ability to manage the enterprise can also be allowed to take charge.

    How to accelerate the self-transformation of private personnel is another focus of everyone's discussion. Many people believe that in the past few years since liberation, especially in the past year, most private personnel in Shanghai have made great progress. They enthusiastically asked to participate in the socialist labor competition within the enterprise, and some even asked to give up fixed interest, remove their labels, and join the trade union, but they often did not receive support from relevant departments.

    Liu Nianzhi hopes that Communists should get along with private personnel in a way that is in line with general human feelings. The calculation of the seniority of private personnel should not start after the enterprise is jointly operated.

    Liu Nianzhi, manager of Zhanghua Woolen Mill, said: The most important thing for people is trust. Bourgeois elements are also people. He hopes that Communists should get along with private personnel in a way that is in line with general human feelings. He also said that when Zhanghua Factory launched a socialist competition last year, many private personnel actively participated, but later, during the evaluation, private personnel were asked to evaluate themselves, and the Party and the trade union did not actively lead. This could not but frustrate the enthusiasm of private personnel. He also said: At present, the seniority of private personnel is calculated from the time when the enterprise is jointly operated. Some private personnel take sick leave or participate in social activities, and the enterprise deducts their salaries in accordance with the regulations. I think this is inappropriate, and I suggest that this issue be re-examined and considered.

    Tao Minzhi and Cheng Guohua respectively requested that the Youth League and the trade union not close their doors to young industrialists and businessmen and wholesalers participating in state-owned companies.

    Young industrialist and businessman Tao Minzhi said: At present, the Youth League organization still keeps the door tightly closed to young industrialists and businessmen. She requested that the League organization absorb young industrialists and businessmen who already meet the requirements for joining the League. She believes that this is of great benefit to encouraging young industrialists and businessmen to accept transformation.

    Cheng Guohua, deputy manager of the Fourth Store of Shanghai Chemical Raw Materials Company, said: Wholesalers were very happy when they accepted transformation. They were determined to go to state-owned companies and were willing to have lower wages and a harder life. These people have been participating in state-owned companies for two years, and they asked to join the trade union, but the door of the trade union was closed, saying that they were bourgeois. In fact, they have no funds to speak of, which is like "wearing a hat with bare arms." He believes that joining the trade union is good for their self-transformation.

    Rong Yiren proposed: Can some fixed-interest small shops be turned into distribution and consignment stores? Can small factories be turned into cooperative factories?

    Rong Yiren, deputy director of the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce, also raised opinions on the problems existing in the work of transforming wholesalers. He suggested: In the evaluation of grades and salaries, attention should be paid to these people's business experience, and administrative subsidy standards should be appropriately considered. He said: The Federation of Industry and Commerce should also consider giving appropriate subsidies to those with difficulties in life.

    Some people also raised suggestions and opinions on the transformation of small households and small owners. Rong Yiren proposed: Can some fixed-interest small shops be turned into distribution and consignment stores? He said: In the past, these small shops were not separated from their homes. Today, once they separate their families, the problem of life cannot be solved, and the country cannot take over. It is better to let them engage in distribution and consignment. As for small factories, can they be turned into cooperative factories so as to give play to the flexibility of small factories and avoid too many restrictions that affect the development of potential?

    Zhang Shanzhang, a standing committee member of the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce, raised opinions on the multiple leadership and busy work of district stores. He said that the busy work of district stores can be summarized in sixteen characters: "heavy tasks, diverse opinions, attacked from above and below, and embarrassed on both sides." He suggested drawing on the experience of private enterprises in setting up general stores and branch stores, and using the method of large enterprises leading small enterprises to replace the current district stores.

    Zhang Aiguo, deputy manager of Shanghai Vegetable Company, said on behalf of the peddlers: Since the peddlers were organized last year, the relevant departments have not paid enough attention to them, and they have not done a good job of consolidation. At present, many people have withdrawn from the group. He requested that all parties can give more support and care to the work of peddlers.

    Ke Qingshi said: The problems reflected at the meeting will be transferred to relevant departments for classified research and resolution.

    Ke Qingshi, First Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, made a final speech. He pointed out that since the upsurge of socialist transformation, the overall situation of Shanghai's industrial and commercial circles has been progressive; at the same time, he encouraged everyone not to carry the burden of progress because of this, and to continue to carry out self-transformation. He promised to transfer the problems reflected at the meeting to relevant departments for classified research and resolution.

    公私合营企业里要不要公方代表？
    怎样把合营企业的工作做得更好？
    上海市工商界代表在市委召开的座谈会上发表意见
    本报上海24日电　本报记者习平报道：在公私合营企业里要不要公方代表？如何在现有的基础上进一步做好公私合营企业的工作？上海市工商界代表昨天下午在中共上海市委召开的座谈会上发抒了自己的意见。
    朱鸿仪说：没有公方代表领导是不能想像的。公私双方应互相尊重。
    许多代表不同意从公私合营企业里撤出公方代表的这种意见。中和造纸厂私方经理朱鸿仪在会上很有风趣地说：“我是一个资本家，刚到上海的时候，一身清风，在十里洋场的上海混成一个资本家，不能算没有本事。企业合营前，我曾想用奖金、超额奖金等办法刺激工人劳动积极性，来提高企业的劳动生产率。我想尽办法，都没有能达到目的。但是，企业合营后，公方代表一到厂，发动工人群众搞生产，产量很快就从过去每月产纸二百吨，提高到三百吨。”他又说：企业虽然合营了，但还不是完全的社会主义企业，企业和人还要进行深刻的改造。这些工作，没有公方代表来领导，是不能想像的。朱鸿仪还说：现在私方人员的薪金一般较高，而且还有定息；职工的收入虽比解放前有了很大提高，但限于国家财力物力，在物质福利方面还不可能很好。这往往造成了企业内部矛盾。这种矛盾也得依靠公方代表来调整。他说：我认为绝大部分公方代表到厂后，都是辛辛苦苦为企业工作；缺点是他们发挥和利用私方才能不够。公方代表样样都管，人不是样样都会的，这好比“顶着石臼推磨”。他建议在公私合营企业里公私双方都要热爱企业，相互尊重，有职有权。
    孙鼎说：上级要帮助公方代表提高政治水平；私方人员要培养“放下屠刀，立地成佛”的感情。
    上海旋转电机公司副经理孙鼎也就这个问题发表了意见。他说：公方厂长肯定不能撤，但上级领导机关要帮助公方代表提高政治水平。上海许多公方代表都是公私合营高潮以后派下去的，他们之中不少的人是解放后历次运动中的积极分子，他们有丰富的阶级斗争经验，往往习惯用过去对待资本家的方法来对待现在企业内的私方人员；而这些同志常常身兼数职，没有学习时间，他们看不到阶级关系的新变化，以致落在新形势的后面，阻碍了社会主义改造工作的发展。因此，对这些同志要加强政治思想教育。他还说：目前有些私方人员自卑感很严重，我认为私方人员应该培养“放下屠刀，立地成佛”的感情，不要学做“武大郎”，认为到处低人一头。他说：私方人员中绝大部分都是热情工作的，希望政府和党不要把他们当作局外人看。
    刘靖基、陈铭珊认为：在一定条件下可放手让私方人员负责。
    中国民主建国会上海市委会副主任刘靖基说：我不能同意天津市某些工商界代表提出的撤退公方代表的说法。但是，个别有条件的企业，例如私方人员本身德才兼备，企业内部民主管理委员会健全，党委领导强，业务工作在专业公司统一规划下，也可以放手让私方人员来锻炼。这样，从积极方面来说，可以抽出一批公方代表到更重要的工作位置上去，同时也为国家培养了一批干部。
    上海制药公司副经理陈铭珊说：企业合营，公方代表下厂，对企业改造确有很大好处。但企业合营一个时期后，也可以让能够依靠工人群众、具有管理企业才能的私方人员负责。
    如何加速私方人员的自我改造，是大家座谈中的另一个中心。许多人认为，解放几年来，特别是最近一年来，上海绝大部分私方人员都有很大的进步，他们热情地要求参加企业内部的社会主义劳动竞赛，还有的人要求放弃定息、摘掉帽子、参加工会，但往往得不到有关部门的支持。
    刘念智希望共产党人同私方人员相处时要合乎一般人情。计算私方人员工龄不该从企业合营以后算起。
    章华毛纺厂经理刘念智说：对人最重要的是信任。资产阶级分子也是人，他希望共产党人在同私方人员相处的时候要合乎一般人情。他还说去年章华厂开展社会主义竞赛时，许多私方人员积极参加了，但后来评选时，却让私方人员自己评选，党和工会都不积极领导，这就不能不挫折了私方人员的积极性。他还说：现在计算私方人员工龄都是从企业合营以后算起，有些私方人员因病请假或参加社会活动，企业按照规定就扣除薪金，我认为这是不妥当的，建议对这个问题加以重新研究考虑。
    陶敏之、程国华分别要求青年团和工会对青年工商业者和参加国营公司的批发商不要关门。
    青年工商业者陶敏之说：目前青年团组织对青年工商业者还是大门紧闭。她要求团组织吸收已经具备入团条件的青年工商业者参加。她认为这对鼓励青年工商业者接受改造，大有好处。
    上海化工原料公司第四商店副经理程国华说：批发商在接受改造时都很高兴，他们决心去国营公司，愿意自己工资低些、生活清苦些。这些人参加国营公司已有二年了，他们要求入工会，但是工会的门关着，说他们是资产阶级。其实，他们均无资金可言，这好比“赤膊戴帽子”。他认为，加入工会对他们的自我改造是有好处的。
    荣毅仁提出：某些定息的小商店可否退一步改为经销代销店？小型工厂可否改为合作工厂？
    上海市工商联副主任委员荣毅仁也对改造批发商的工作中存在的问题提出意见。他建议：在评级评薪上应重视这些人的业务经验，适当考虑行政补助标准。他表示：对生活有困难的，工商联同时也要考虑给以适当补助。
    对于小户和小业主的改造等问题，也有人提出了建议和意见。荣毅仁提出：某些定息的小商店可否退一步改为经销代销？他说：过去这些小商店都是家店不分的，今天一旦分家，生活问题不能解决，国家也不能包下来，还不如让他们搞经销代销。至于小型工厂，可否改为合作工厂，以便发挥小厂的灵活性，免得限制太死而影响潜力的发挥。
    上海市工商联常务委员张善章就区店的多头领导、工作忙乱提出意见。他说，区店的忙乱可用“任务重重，意见纷纷，上下夹攻，左右为难”十六个字来概括。他建议吸取私营企业设总店分店的经验，用以大带小的方式，来代替目前的区店。
    上海蔬菜公司副经理张爱国代表摊贩说：摊贩自去年组织起来以后，有关部门对他们不够重视，也没有做巩固工作。目前有不少人退组。他要求各方面能多多支持和关怀摊贩工作。
    柯庆施说：会上反映的问题，将转给有关部门分门别类研究解决。
    中共上海市委第一书记柯庆施最后发言。他指出社会主义改造高潮以来，上海工商界总的情况是进步的；同时勉励大家不要因此背上进步包袱，要继续进行自我改造。对会上反映的问题，他答应将转给有关部门，把问题分门别类研究和解决。
