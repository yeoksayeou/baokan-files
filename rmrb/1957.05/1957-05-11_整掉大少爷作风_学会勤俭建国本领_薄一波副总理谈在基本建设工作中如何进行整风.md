(From our correspondent Ji Xichen and Li Ce in Chengdu on the 10th) Vice Premier Bo Yibo, based on his and Vice Premier Li Fuchun's recent inspection of basic construction in Xi'an, Chengdu, and other places, gave a report on the 9th at a conference of Party members and non-Party cadres in Sichuan Province and Chengdu City, entitled "How to Conduct Rectification in Basic Construction Work." He called on all cadres, especially those working on the economic front, to learn the skills of building the country through thrift and hard work and to overcome bureaucracy and subjectivism in basic construction work. Bo Yibo said: Thrift and hard work in building the country is a very important component of the Party Central Committee's general policy for resolving contradictions among the people. If this issue is not handled well, it will expand contradictions among the people and affect the country's construction.

Construction Achievements Are Huge
But Much Money Has Been Wasted
If We Learn the Skills, We Can Save About 25% of Investment

He said: In the past few years, our country's achievements in basic construction have been huge and primary. Everywhere in the motherland, there is a thriving scene of construction, which is encouraging. However, while achieving success, we have also made many mistakes, spent a lot of money unjustly, and wasted a lot of funds. If we learn the skills of basic construction and do a good job in surveying, design, and construction, we can save about 25% of investment. How can we achieve more with less money? The key lies in summarizing the experience of basic construction through this rectification and implementing the policy of hard work and thrift in building the country.

The Enemy of Building the Country through Thrift and Hard Work
Young Master Mentality Can Be Seen Everywhere

He said: A large population, poverty, and backward economic technology are the realities we face. Because we lacked a full understanding of this reality in the past, many deviations and errors have occurred in basic construction, such as being divorced from reality, divorced from the masses, and one-sidedly pursuing the largest scale, modernization, and excessively high construction standards. From the construction sites, one cannot see that we are a poor country, but everywhere one sees the young master mentality of not cherishing national assets. This mentality is specifically manifested in:

Excessive Construction Scale

(1) The construction scale is too large, and it is one-sidedly believed that the larger the better. Newly designed and built coal mines are all intended to have a scale of 600,000 or 900,000 tons per year, and cotton mills are intended to have hundreds of thousands of spindles. Facts have proved that large scale is not necessarily economical. For example, the cost of coal for coal mines under the central competent authorities is twelve yuan per ton, while that for provincial-owned mines is only nine yuan, and that for special and county-owned mines is only five yuan. Building a few modern large factories, such as the 156 projects, as the backbone of industrial construction is entirely necessary. However, not all construction can be modernized, specialized, and mechanized. Excessive mechanization not only costs too much but also squeezes out handicrafts; excessive specialization limits the diversity of products. The tendency to pursue large-scale modernization also exists universally in civil buildings such as office buildings, guesthouses, employee dormitories, schools, cinemas, theaters, and hotels.

Excessive Land Use for Construction

(2) Excessive land use for basic construction. There is a wasteful phenomenon of "more requisitioned but less used, early requisition but late use, requisitioned but not used" in requisitioning land from farmers, which affects agricultural production and causes farmers' dissatisfaction. In urban planning, long-term plans are often turned into current construction plans. Some construction projects are now unsuitable due to excessively high standards, and they will not be suitable in the future either. For example, some factories have excessively large auxiliary building areas, and the factory building itself only accounts for about 25% of the land area. Some factories also leave unnecessary room for development, and some factories also set up "alert zones" and "soil loosening footprint inspection zones" around them. This practice is not only unnecessary for general factories, but also unnecessary for defense factories.

Excessively High Construction Standards

(3) Some factories have excessively high construction standards, with factory buildings that are too high and too large, and sparsely installed machinery. There are too many non-production buildings and too many employee family residences, which encourages a large influx of employee families into the cities, increasing the urban burden. At the same time, employee dormitories and office buildings have excessively high standards, generally far exceeding the living conditions of local citizens and farmers, which is seriously divorced from the masses. Some field geological exploration units, etc., also have too many temporary buildings, which are too expensive and cannot be fully utilized, resulting in great waste and causing farmers' dissatisfaction. He said: In the past few years, about 60 million square meters of dormitories, office buildings, and other buildings have been built across the country, with an average cost of about 60 yuan per square meter. If 30% of them are converted into simple houses, each square meter will only cost 20 yuan. This item alone can save the country 720 million yuan.

One-Sided Pursuit of Automation and All-Around Capability

(4) One-sidedly pursuing mechanization, automation, and all-around capability without taking into account the characteristics of our country with a large population, which has affected social labor employment, while social labor employment is a very serious problem in our country. At the same time, the one-sided pursuit of new equipment has increased the country's foreign exchange expenditure. Because of the pursuit of all-around capability, each factory has its own set of equipment, which has also led to waste. For example, there are four state-owned factories in Chengdu, each with its own machine repair and carpentry workshops, and these tasks can be completely undertaken by local factories and handicrafts. Chongqing and Chengdu already have surplus mechanical processing capacity, but some units have spent a lot of money to build repair and assembly plants. In this way, the mutual support and cooperation between factories and departments are actually canceled, wasting a large amount of national funds.

Too Many Dormitories Built, Families Flood into Cities

(5) Some units have inappropriately built too many and too large construction bases and built many dormitories, children's schools, hospitals, and other buildings. A large number of employee families have flooded into the cities, resulting in a sharp increase in the urban population, and urban public utilities and service industries have also increased a lot of investment as a result. In addition, on the issue of labor wages, the unified allocation of labor and the uniformity of wage standards were overemphasized in the past. There are also many unreasonable phenomena in increasing fixed workers, technical schools, and welfare bonuses.

Deeply Carry Out the Rectification Movement to Eliminate This Bad Style

The above shortcomings are generally present in basic construction units throughout the country. The reasons for these shortcomings are mainly due to a lack of experience and the bureaucracy, subjectivism, and dogmatism that still exist in our work. Now, we must eliminate this young master mentality through this rectification movement. This style is the enemy of building the country through thrift and hard work and the enemy of realizing industrialization. In order to implement the policy of thrift and hard work in basic construction, in addition to deeply carrying out the rectification movement, he said, the following measures must be taken in the future:

(1) Formulate a correct technical policy. Except for a few necessary factories that must use automated and mechanized equipment, general factories must combine mechanization, semi-mechanization, and manual operation.

(2) Lower the standards of basic construction. Urban civil buildings should be the same as those of residents, and rural work units should be the same as those of farmers.

(3) Rely mainly on self-reliance and supplement with foreign aid. Try to design and manufacture equipment ourselves, and try to use domestically produced equipment to reduce foreign exchange expenditure.

(4) Combine large enterprises with small and medium-sized enterprises, and focus on small and medium-sized enterprises. Small coal, iron, and even non-ferrous metals and most light industries should be handed over to local management.

(5) Rationally organize production specialization and collaboration, so that specialization and collaboration are combined. Factories of the same type should try to share equipment such as machine repair, carpentry, and testing.

(6) Use old cities to build new factories. Small cities that only build one or two factories will generally no longer engage in urban planning like in the past.

(7) The construction of new industrial zones should be combined with local industry, agriculture, and handicrafts to support and cooperate with each other, and oppose mutual exclusion and restraint.

(8) Employee housing should mainly solve the problem of collective dormitories. Family housing should be built as little as possible or not at all. In order to facilitate employee visits to relatives, consideration can be given to establishing a vacation system.

(9) The allocation of labor and wage standards are uniformly controlled by the local government to give play to local initiative and appropriately reduce various enterprise funds.

(10) Rectify the existing construction bases and stop the practice of blindly expanding construction bases.

Vice Premier Bo Yibo finally said: The above are just some preliminary views we have during this inspection, and some issues need to be further investigated and studied.

    整掉大少爷作风　学会勤俭建国本领
    薄一波副总理谈在基本建设工作中如何进行整风
    本报成都10日电　本报记者纪希晨、李策报道：薄一波副总理根据他和李富春副总理最近在西安、成都等地视察基本建设情况，9日在四川省和成都市党内外干部大会上，以“在基本建设工作中如何进行整风”为题作了报告。他号召全体干部，特别是经济战线上工作的同志，学会勤俭建国的本领，克服基本建设工作中的官僚主义和主观主义。薄一波说：勤俭建国是党中央提出关于解决人民内部矛盾总方针中的非常重要的一个组成部分。这个问题处理得不好，就会扩大人民内部的矛盾，影响国家的建设。
    建设成绩虽然巨大
    冤枉钱也花了很多
    如果学会本领，可能节约投资25％左右
    他说：几年来我们国家基本建设的成绩是巨大的、主要的，在祖国的大地上，到处都呈现着建设的蓬勃景象，令人鼓舞。但是在取得成绩的同时，也犯了不少错误，花了很多冤枉钱，浪费了很多资金。如果我们学会了基本建设的本领，把勘测、设计、施工工作做好，就可能节约投资的25％左右。怎样才能做到少花钱多办事呢？关键在于通过这次整风，总结基本建设的经验，贯彻艰苦奋斗、勤俭建国的方针。
    勤俭建国的敌人
     大少爷作风到处可见
    他说：人口多、贫穷、经济技术落后，是我们面对着的实际情况，由于我们过去对于这个实际情况缺乏充分的认识，因此，在基本建设中就出现了不少偏差和错误，如脱离实际，脱离群众，片面地追求最大规模，追求现代化和过高的建设标准。从建筑工地上看不出我们是贫穷的国家，而到处却看到不爱护国家资财的大少爷作风。这种作风具体表现在：
    建筑规模过大
    （1）建筑规模过大，片面地认为越大越好。新设计新建煤井都是想搞年产六十万、九十万吨规模的，纱厂要搞几十万纱锭的。事实证明规模大不一定经济。例如，煤的成本，中央主管部门所属煤矿，每吨煤的成本是十二元，省属的只有九元，专、县所属的只要五元。建设少数现代化的大厂，如一百五十六项企业，作为工业建设的骨干，是完全必要的。但是不能一切建设都搞现代化、专业化、机械化。过高的机械化不但成本太高，而且要挤掉手工业；过度的专业化，限制了产品的多样性。追求大规模现代化的倾向，在办公大楼、招待所、职工宿舍、学校、电影院、剧院、旅馆等民用建筑方面也普遍存在着。
    建设用地过多
    （2）基本建设用地过多。征用农民土地存在着“多征少用、早征迟用、征而不用”的浪费现象，影响农业增产，引起农民不满。在城市规划方面也往往把远景规划变成现在的建设计划。有些建设项目由于标准过高，现在不适用，将来也不适用。例如有些工厂辅助建筑面积过大，厂房本身的建筑仅占用地面积的25％左右。有些工厂还留下了不必要的发展余地，有的工厂四周还设立了“警戒地带”和“松土足迹检查地带”。这种做法，不但一般工厂没有必要，就是国防工厂也是不必要的。
    建筑标准过高
    （3）有些工厂建筑标准过高，厂房过高过大，机器安装稀稀拉拉。非生产建筑过多，职工家属住宅过多，因此鼓励了职工家属大批流入城市，增加城市负担。同时职工宿舍、办公楼标准过高，一般的都大大超过当地市民农民的居住条件，严重地脱离了群众。有些野外地质勘查等单位，临时建筑房屋也过多，造价过高，不能充分利用，造成很大浪费，也引起农民不满。他说：全国几年来大约盖了六千万平方公尺的宿舍、办公楼等建筑，每平方公尺平均造价是六十元左右，如果把其中30％改为简易房屋，每平方公尺只要二十元。单是这一项就可以替国家节省七亿二千万元。
     片面追求自动化全能化
    （4）片面地追求机械化、自动化和全能化，没有照顾我国有广大人力的特点，因此影响了社会劳动就业，而社会劳动就业却是我国非常严重的问题。同时，由于片面追求新设备，增加了国家的外汇开支。由于追求全能化，每个工厂各搞一套，也形成了浪费的现象。例如成都有四个国营工厂，每个厂都有自己的机修木工车间，而他们的这些任务完全可以由当地工厂和手工业担负起来。重庆和成都的机械加工能力本来就有余，可是有的单位却花了很多钱去建设修配厂。这样，就实际取消了工厂和部门之间的相互支援，相互协作，浪费了国家大量资金。
    宿舍修建过多，家属涌进城市
    （5）有些单位不适当地建设过多过大的建筑基地，修建了许多宿舍、子弟学校、医院等建筑，职工家属大批涌进城市，以致城市人口激增，城市公用事业和服务性行业也因之增加了很多投资。另外，在劳动工资问题上，过去片面强调劳动力统一调配，过分地强调了工资标准的统一。在增加固定工人、技工学校和福利奖金等方面，也有很多不合理的现象。
    深入开展整风运动把这种坏作风整掉
  以上这些缺点在全国各地基本建设单位都普遍存在着。产生这些缺点的原因，主要是由于经验不足和我们在工作中还存在着的官僚主义、主观主义和教条主义所造成的。现在，我们要通过这次整风运动，整掉这种大少爷作风。这种作风是勤俭建国的敌人，是实现工业化的敌人。为了在基本建设方面贯彻勤俭建国的方针，除了深入开展整风运动以外，他说，今后必须采取以下措施：
    （1）规定正确的技术政策。除了少数必要的工厂必须用自动化机械化的设备外，一般工厂都要把机械化，半机械化和手工操作结合起来。
    （2）降低基本建设标准，城市的民用建筑要同居民看齐，野外工作单位的民用建筑要同农民看齐。
    （3）自力更生为主，争取外援为辅。尽量自己设计，自己制造设备，尽量采用本国出产的设备，以减少外汇开支。
    （4）大型企业与中小型企业相结合，而以中小型企业为主。小型的煤、铁，甚至有色金属及大部分轻工业都应交给地方上经营。
    （5）合理组织生产专业化和协作，使专业和协作相结合。同类的工厂要尽量共同使用机修、木工和化验等设备。
    （6）利用旧城市建设新工厂。只建设一两个厂子的小城市，一般都不再搞像过去那样的城市规划。
    （7）新工业区的建设要和当地的工业、农业和手工业相结合，相互支援、协作，反对互相排斥、牵制。
    （8）职工住宅主要是解决集体宿舍。家属住宅应尽量少建或不建。为了便于职工探亲，可以考虑建立休假制度。
    （9）劳动力调配和工资标准，统一由地方掌握，发挥地方主动性，并适当降低企业各种基金。
    （10）整顿现有的建筑基地，停止盲目扩大建筑基地的作法。
    薄一波副总理最后说：以上这些仅是我们在这次视察中的一些初步看法，有些问题还需要作进一步检查和研究。
