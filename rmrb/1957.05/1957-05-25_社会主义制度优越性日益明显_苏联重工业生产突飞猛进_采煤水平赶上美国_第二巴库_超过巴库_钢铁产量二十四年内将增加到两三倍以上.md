Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 24th - The fourth issue of the "Young Communist" magazine this year points out that the Soviet Union's coal mining level has now caught up with that of the United States, the world's largest coal producer.

    An article in the magazine says that, according to the state plan, coal mining enterprises in the Soviet Union and its constituent republics will mine a total of 446.2 million tons of coal this year. In addition, local coal mining enterprises across the country will also produce a large amount of coal. In terms of coal mining level, the Soviet Union has caught up with the United States.

    According to statistics published by the United States and the United Nations, the United States produced approximately 450 million tons of coal in 1955 (approximately 30% of the world's total production). Last year, there was a slight increase, reaching over 470 million tons. However, since the beginning of this year, the United States' coal production has decreased significantly, while the Soviet Union's coal production increased by almost 10 million tons in the first quarter alone.

    Catching up with the United States in terms of absolute coal production is an important step for the Soviet Union in achieving its main economic task (catching up with and surpassing advanced capitalist countries in per capita output).

Xinhua News Agency, 23rd - TASS reports: At present, the oil region known as the Soviet Union's "Second Baku" (between the Urals and the Volga River) produces more than 70% of the Soviet Union's total oil production. Last year, this proportion was 58.3%.

    The "Second Baku" oil region includes the Tatar and Bashkir Autonomous Republics, as well as the Kuibyshev, Saratov, and Stalingrad Oblasts, covering a total area of approximately one million square kilometers. Bashkir was the first region in this oil-producing area to begin oil extraction. Twenty-five years ago, an exploration team led by the outstanding Russian geologist Blokhin drilled the republic's first oil well in the village of Ishimbay. Since then, Bashkir has produced a total of over 100 million tons of oil.

    In the Tatar Autonomous Republic, oil extraction in 1956 had already reached the level of the world-famous Baku oil field, which is also the oldest in Soviet history. Now, it has become the region with the highest oil production in the Soviet Union.

    During the new Five-Year Plan, the oil industry in the "Second Baku" will develop at an even faster rate. Oil extraction in the Tatar Autonomous Republic will increase 3.3 times, in the Kuibyshev Oblast by 2.5 times, and in the Bashkir Autonomous Republic by almost 2 times.

    The oil pipelines being laid will transport the oil from the Second Baku to Siberia, the Far East, and central regions of the Soviet Union. The Tuimazy-Omsk section has already been completed and has begun transporting oil to Siberia's first new oil refinery, the Omsk refinery.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 24th - While the coal mining level has already caught up with the United States, the Soviet Union is striving to catch up with this most advanced capitalist country in terms of absolute steel production in a very short period.

    According to the estimate of Academician Bardin of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, in the next twenty-four years, the Soviet Union's annual steel production should increase by more than two and a half to three times, and annual pig iron production should increase by more than 2.7 to 3.3 times.

    This famous Soviet scientist said at the Soviet Supreme Soviet meeting, which opened in the middle of this month, that in the forty years since the establishment of the Soviet regime, the Soviet Union's steel production had increased twelve times compared to 1913 before the October Revolution. If we exclude the period of national economic recovery before 1924 and the later period of economic development interruption caused by the Great Patriotic War, the Soviet Union actually increased its steel production to its current level in just twenty years and jumped from fifth place in world steel production before World War I to second place.

    Academician Bardin pointed out that the United States currently produces approximately 100 million tons of steel annually. In order to catch up with and surpass the level of steel industry production in the United States in the shortest historical period, Bardin believes that the Soviet Union's annual steel production should increase to 125 million to 150 million tons, and pig iron production should increase to 100 million to 120 million tons during the period from 1957 to 1980.

    Judging from the speed of development of the Soviet steel industry, it is achievable for the Soviet Union to catch up with and even surpass the level of steel production in the United States in a short period. In the twenty-six years before 1956, the Soviet Union's steel production increased by an average of 9% per year, while the United States only increased by an average of 2.4%. In 1956, the Soviet Union's steel production increased by 3.3 million tons, while the United States' steel production increased by only 4.1 million tons, even though its production base was more than twice as large as that of the Soviet Union.

    社会主义制度优越性日益明显
    苏联重工业生产突飞猛进
    采煤水平赶上美国  “第二巴库”超过巴库
    钢铁产量二十四年内将增加到两三倍以上
    新华社莫斯科24日电　今年第四期“青年共产党人”杂志指出，苏联采煤水平现在已经赶上了全世界产煤量最高的美国。
    这家杂志的一篇文章说，根据国家计划，今年苏联全联盟和加盟共和国的采煤工业企业总共将开采四亿四千六百二十万吨煤。此外，全国各地的地方采煤工业企业还将生产大量的煤。按照采煤水平，苏联已经赶上了美国。
    据美国和联合国方面发表的统计材料，1955年美国大约生产了四亿五千万吨煤（约占世界总产量的30％），去年稍有增加，大约达到四亿七千万吨以上。可是，今年以来，美国的煤产量却下降了不少，而苏联的煤产量单在第一季度就差不多增加了一千万吨。
    从煤的绝对产量上赶上美国的水平，这是苏联在实现它的主要经济任务（在按人口平均计算产量上赶上和超过先进资本主义国家）方面的一个重要步骤。
    据新华社23日讯　据塔斯社报道：目前，号称苏联“第二巴库”的石油区（在乌拉尔和伏尔加河之间）所出产的石油已经占全苏联石油总产量70％以上。去年这个比重是58.3％。
    “第二巴库”石油区包括鞑靼和巴什基尔自治共和国以及古比雪夫、萨拉托夫和斯大林格勒州，总面积约有一百万平方公里。巴什基尔是这个产油区中最先开采石油的地区。二十五年以前，以优秀的俄罗斯地质学家布洛欣为首的一个勘探队在伊希姆巴伊村开凿了共和国的第一口油井。从那个时候到现在，巴什基尔总共已经出产了一亿吨以上的石油。
    在鞑靼自治共和国，石油开采量在1956年已经达到了世界著名的、同时也是苏联历史最久的巴库油田的水平，而现在，它已经成为苏联出产石油最多的地区。
    在新五年计划期间，“第二巴库”的石油工业将以更快的速度发展。鞑靼自治共和国的石油开采量将增加到三点三倍，古比雪夫州将增加到二倍半，巴什基尔自治共和国将差不多增加到两倍。
    正在铺设的输油管将把第二巴库的石油输往西伯利亚、远东和苏联中部等地区。图伊马兹—鄂木斯克一段已经建成，并且开始向西伯利亚新建的第一个炼油厂——鄂木斯克炼油厂输油。
    新华社莫斯科24日电　在采煤水平已经赶上美国的同时，苏联正在努力争取在很短的时期内在钢铁绝对产量上也赶上这个最先进的资本主义国家。
    根据苏联科学院院士巴尔金的估计，在今后二十四年间，苏联钢的年产量应当增加为两倍半到三倍以上，生铁年产量应当增加为二点七倍到三点三倍以上。
    这位著名的苏联科学家在本月中旬开幕的苏联最高苏维埃会议上发言时曾经说，在苏维埃政权建立后的四十年间，苏联的钢产量已经增加为十月革命前1913年的十二倍。如果把1924年以前的国民经济恢复时期和后来由于伟大卫国战争而引起的经济发展的中断时期除外，苏联实际上是在短短二十年期间把钢产量提高到目前的水平的，并且由第一次世界大战前占世界钢产量的第五位跃居第二位。
    巴尔金院士指出，目前，美国每年生产的钢约在一亿吨左右。为了要在最短的历史期间赶上和超过美国的钢铁工业生产水平，巴尔金认为，在1957年至1980年期间，苏联的钢年产量应该增加到一亿二千五百万吨到一亿五千万吨，生铁年产量应该增加到一亿吨到一亿二千万吨。
    根据苏联钢铁工业发展的速度看来，苏联要在短时期内赶上甚至超过美国的钢铁生产水平，是可以达到的。在1956年以前的二十六年期间，苏联钢产量每年平均增长9％，而美国平均只增长2.4％。1956年，苏联钢产量增加了三百三十万吨，而美国增产的钢也不过只有四百一十多万吨，尽管它的生产基数要比苏联大一倍以上。
