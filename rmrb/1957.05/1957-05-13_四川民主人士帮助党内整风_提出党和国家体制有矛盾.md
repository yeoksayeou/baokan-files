Sichuan Democratic Personages Help the Party Rectification
Point Out Contradictions Between Party and State Systems

(Our Chengdu Dispatch) At a symposium convened by the United Front Work Department of the Sichuan Provincial Committee on the 10th, democratic personages from various democratic parties and non-party figures in Sichuan spoke freely and offered many criticisms and opinions to the Party to help carry out the rectification movement in Sichuan.

Pan Daikui, Chairman of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, pointed out that there is still a wall between the Party and non-Party members. This is caused by the sense of superiority of some Communist Party members. Some people, after joining the Party, become estranged from their non-Party friends because they think that being the same as before lacks the mettle of a Communist Party member.

Huang Xianzhang, Vice Chairman of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association, said that if the Communist Party members' sectarianism is not eliminated, it will greatly affect the unity and enthusiasm of non-Party figures. Regarding the issue of public-private cooperation, he said that in joint ventures, on the one hand, public-private cooperation is an equal relationship, and on the other hand, it is a class relationship, and must obey the leadership of the public side. This is a contradiction. How to correctly handle the contradiction between these two relationships so that the class relationship does not hinder the enthusiasm of the private sector personnel is a problem worthy of attention.

Liu Xingyuan, Chairman of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, said that after the principle of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision was put forward, the relationship between the Party and the democratic parties has indeed improved, but there is still a distance. He believes that this distance cannot be entirely attributed to the work style of Communist Party members; there are also some issues with the national system that are worth studying. He said that in administrative departments, Communist Party members have specific instructions from the Party and grasp policies more accurately, while non-Party members, even if they are in charge, cannot read them. When Party and non-Party leaders meet to study work, differences of opinion often arise because of this. This not only easily creates estrangement, but also causes non-Party members to have the title without the power; this is a contradiction between the Party and the state system.

Li Zixiang, Zhong Tigan, and others, Vice Chairmen of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, also spoke on how to create conditions to eliminate the concerns of non-Party members, so that they can boldly put forward their opinions, which would be beneficial to the progress of the rectification movement.

    四川民主人士帮助党内整风
    提出党和国家体制有矛盾
    本报成都讯　在10日四川省委统战部召开的座谈会上，四川各民主党派和无党派民主人士，畅所欲言，对党提出许多批评和意见，以帮助四川整风运动开展。
    民盟四川省委主任委员潘大逵首先指出，党与非党之间，仍有一道墙。这是某些共产党员优越感造成的。有些人入党以后，就和党外朋友生疏起来，这是因为他们认为再和以前一样，就缺乏共产党员气魄。
    民建四川省委副主任委员黄宪章说，共产党员宗派主义不消除，很影响团结和党外人士积极性。对公私共事问题，他说在合营企业中，一方面公私共事是平等关系，另方面是阶级关系，必须服从公方领导，这是矛盾。如何正确处理这两种关系的矛盾，使阶级关系不妨碍私方人员积极性的发挥，是值得重视的问题。
    农工民主党四川省委主任委员刘星垣说，长期共存、互相监督方针提出后，党与民主党派关系确实有了改进，但也存在距离。他认为这种距离不能完全归咎于共产党员的作风，国家的体制也有些值得研究的问题。他说，在行政部门共产党员因有党的具体指示，掌握政策准确一些，而党外人士那怕是负责人，也不能阅读。党内外负责人在一起开会研究工作的时候，就常因此出现分歧意见。这就不仅容易造成隔阂，而且造成党外人士有职无权，这是党和国家体制之间的矛盾。
    民革四川省委副主任委员李紫翔、钟体乾等还就如何创造条件，消除党外人士顾虑，使他们大胆提意见，以利于整风运动的进行等问题，作了发言。
