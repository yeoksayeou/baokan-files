    Lathe for Manufacturing Watches
    The small, precision lathe for manufacturing watches, which had previously relied on imports, has recently been successfully trial-produced by the Tianjin Second Tool and Agricultural Machinery Production Cooperative. This lathe can turn, mill, and grind various parts for wristwatches and pocket watches.
