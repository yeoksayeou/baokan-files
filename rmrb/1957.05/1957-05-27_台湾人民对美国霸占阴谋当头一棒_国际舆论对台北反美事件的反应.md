Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The anti-American struggle that erupted in Taipei has drawn the attention of various countries' public opinion, which believes that this is a head-on blow to the American attempt to occupy Taiwan for a long time.

Rogov published an article in Moscow's "Izvestia" on the 26th, saying that the anti-American demonstration in Taipei strongly struck a blow to the myth that the residents of Taiwan support the rule of the US-Chiang clique.

The author wrote that the mass movement of the people of Taipei against the American occupiers once again proves that the forces actively striving for the liberation of Taiwan, which has belonged to China since ancient times, are growing stronger. It proves that the policies of those who expect to use cannons and aircraft carriers to stop the irreversible historical process have gone bankrupt.

Vietnam's "People's Daily" said on the 26th, "This is a major blow to US imperialism."

The hatred of the Chinese people of Taiwan towards US imperialism is deeply rooted, mainly because the US imperialists have occupied Taiwan as a colony and treated the local people as slaves.

The commentary said that the fearless struggle of the Chinese people of Taiwan will have a strong impact on the movements against US imperialism and its lackeys in South Vietnam, South Korea and other places.

Cairo's "People's Daily" published an editorial on the 25th, saying that the large-scale anti-American demonstration by the Taiwanese people taught imperialism an unforgettable lesson. "This sudden outbreak is the result of the accumulation of hatred caused by the attempt to separate a part of the Chinese people from the motherland and turn Taiwan into an American base in the Far East."

Japanese newspapers continue to express sympathy for the large-scale anti-American demonstrations in Taipei.

The three major Japanese newspapers—"Mainichi Shimbun," "Asahi Shimbun," and "Yomiuri Shimbun"—published articles in their columns again on the 26th, supporting the dissatisfaction of the Chinese people of Taiwan with the killing of people by American soldiers.

Philippine Ambassador to the United States Romulo said in a conversation with reporters on the 25th that there is still a threat of anti-American incidents like the one in Taipei happening again, "unless Asians are given jurisdiction over criminal cases in their territories." He pointed out that the issue of court jurisdiction has not been resolved with the United States in the Philippines either.

London newspapers published reports on the Taipei incident with banner headlines. The focus of the reports was: The United States gave the Chiang Kai-shek group in Taiwan so much assistance, but the result was not pleasant.

The "News Chronicle" commented on the 25th: This is just a part of the entire anti-American sentiment in Asia. The "Daily Telegraph" commented on the 25th: "This violent anti-American riot in Taiwan is a bolt from the blue for the American public and officials. Taiwan's existence relies entirely on American support and assistance, but what it has received in return is not gratitude but hostility." The newspaper said: "Younger Chinese people hate the Americans there, treating them as enemies, while the older generation is angry that the Americans have destroyed Chinese traditions." "The Times" believes that this incident is not accidental. It said: The anti-American tide has been brewing for "quite some time" and is about to erupt.

    台湾人民对美国霸占阴谋当头一棒
    国际舆论对台北反美事件的反应
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：台北爆发的反美斗争，引起各国舆论的注意，认为这是台湾人民对美国企图长期霸占台湾的当头一棒。
    罗果夫26日在莫斯科“消息报”上发表文章说，在台北所爆发的反美示威事件，强有力地打击了所谓台湾居民支持美蒋统治的这种神话。
    作者写道，台北人民反对美国占领者的群众运动再一次证明，积极争取解放自古以来就属于中国的台湾的力量日益壮大。它证明，那些指望用大炮和航空母舰来制止不能改变的历史进程的人们的政策破产了。
    越南“人民报”26日说，“这是对美帝国主义的一个重大打击”。
    台湾的中国人民对美帝国主义的憎恨情绪是根深蒂固的，主要的原因在于美帝国主义者把台湾当作殖民地加以占领，并且把当地人民当作奴隶。
    评论说，台湾中国人民这一无畏的斗争将对南越、南朝鲜和其他地方的反对美帝国主义及其仆从的运动产生强有力的影响。
    开罗“人民报”25日发表社论说，台湾人民的反美大示威给帝国主义上了难忘的一课。“这个突然的爆发是由于使中国人民的一部分同祖国分离开来并且把台湾变成美国的远东基地这种企图所造成的仇恨的感情郁积的结果。”
    日本报纸继续表示同情台北的反美大示威。
    日本三大报纸——“每日新闻”、“朝日新闻”和“读卖新闻”26日又在专栏发表文章，支持台湾中国人民对美士兵杀人案的不满情绪。
    菲律宾驻美大使罗慕洛25日在一次对记者谈话中说，还有再发生台北那样的反美事件的威胁，“除非让亚洲人拥有处理他们领土上的犯罪案件的司法权”。他指出，在菲律宾也没有同美国解决法院裁判权的问题。
    伦敦各报以通栏大标题刊登了台北事件的报道。报道的重点是：美国给台湾蒋介石集团那么大量的援助，结果并不美妙。
      “新闻纪事报”25日评论说：这不过是亚洲整个反美情绪的一部分。“每日电讯报”25日评论说：“台湾的这次猛烈的反美暴动对美国的公众和官员们是个晴天霹雳。台湾的存在完全靠美国的支持和援助，但是换来的不是感激却是敌意。”这家报纸说：“年纪较轻的中国人讨厌美国人在那里，把他们视若仇敌，而老一辈的人气的是美国人破坏了中国的传统。”“泰晤士报”认为这次事件不是偶然的。它说：反美怒潮在“相当时期以来”一直在酝酿着要爆发。
