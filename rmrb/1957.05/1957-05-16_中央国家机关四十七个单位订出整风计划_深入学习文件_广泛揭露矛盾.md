Xinhua News Agency, May 15th: A Xinhua reporter learned from the Central State Organs Committee of the Communist Party of China that, as of yesterday, forty-seven of the sixty-three units of central state organs had formulated plans for the rectification movement, and the leading Party comrades of thirty-nine units had already made mobilization reports on the rectification to all Party members and non-Party cadres. Currently, many units are both deeply studying the rectification documents and holding various symposiums with Party members and non-Party members, boldly promoting democracy, and encouraging criticism to understand the situation and expose contradictions.

The rectification plans that have been formulated by the forty-seven units show that: a minority of units have been able to formulate plans that, according to the spirit of the CPC Central Committee's instructions and in light of the specific circumstances of the unit, specifically propose the main contradictions to be resolved; a majority of units have formulated plans in which the issues to be addressed are stated more generally, because the main contradictions existing in the unit have not been clearly identified; and a minority of units, despite repeated study, have a very limited understanding of the situation, and thus have formulated rectification plans that are overly general. Many units are prepared to further understand the situation and identify contradictions in the future, so that the focus of rectification will gradually become clear.

In formulating rectification plans, many units have encountered the following question: should the rectification movement first solve the major national policy issues related to the work of the department, or should it first solve the main contradictions in the ideological work style of the leading organs? Some people believe that the former must be solved first, because this is the key issue of the rectification movement in the central state organs. However, more people believe that this cannot be mechanically prescribed. Although the former issue is key, it is impossible to solve the major national policy issues if the shortcomings in the ideological work style of the leading organs are not overcome. Therefore, which issue to solve first in the rectification should be decided by each organ according to the specific circumstances. Whichever issue urgently needs to be resolved should be addressed first.

Many units believe that the rectification movement is a Marxist-Leninist ideological education movement. Therefore, it is necessary to deeply study the rectification documents, especially at the beginning of the movement, to eliminate concerns and enhance confidence. However, the study of rectification documents should not be conducted mechanically and in isolation. While studying the documents, it is necessary to pay attention to linking theory with practice, especially to boldly promote democracy, encourage criticism, and allow the broad masses of Party members and non-Party cadres to boldly "contend" and "bloom" to expose various contradictions.

Recently, many units such as the Academy of Sciences, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, the Ministry of Electric Power, and the Ministry of Urban Services have been holding various symposiums with Party members and non-Party members, including scientists, democratic personages, and engineering and technical personnel, in a planned manner while studying the documents, and extensively soliciting opinions. In units where responsible Party cadres can boldly encourage criticism, the broad masses of non-Party personages can speak freely and enthusiastically help the Communist Party carry out rectification. More than twenty engineering and technical personnel from the Ministry of Electric Power spoke freely about Party-masses relations at a symposium, raising many issues worthy of the Communist Party's attention and reflection. Non-Party personages from the People's Bank of China made sharp criticisms of Party members, which greatly surprised many Party members, who felt that the problem was serious and very helpful to the rectification movement. At present, there are still individual unit leaders who dare not boldly promote democracy and encourage criticism, and do not proceed from reality, do not follow the mass line, and only a few leaders close their doors to explore the main contradictions, requiring the masses to study the documents in isolation, not allowing them to link theory with practice and expose contradictions. As a result, the masses have many opinions, and the main contradictions have not been found. Some comrades believe that inviting non-Party personages to participate in symposiums and criticize the shortcomings of the Party is an important method for non-Party personages to help the Communist Party in rectification. Such meetings can be held not only at the ministerial level, but also at the division and bureau levels and below. In addition, the opinions of non-Party personages can also be solicited through three- or five-person conversations with non-Party friends, individual heart-to-heart talks, and visits.

    中央国家机关四十七个单位订出整风计划
    深入学习文件　广泛揭露矛盾
    新华社15日讯　新华社记者从中国共产党中央国家机关委员会获悉：到昨天为止，中央国家机关六十三个单位中，已有四十七个单位制定出了整风运动的规划，三十九个单位的党组负责同志已经向全体党员和党外干部作了整风动员报告。目前许多单位一面深入学习整风文件，一面正召开党内外各种座谈会，放手发扬民主，鼓励批评，以摸清情况，揭发矛盾。
    已经制定出来的四十七个单位的整风规划表明：能根据中共中央指示精神，结合本单位具体情况，在规划中比较具体地提出了要着重解决的主要矛盾的单位，占少数；由于对本单位存在的主要矛盾摸得还不够清楚，规划中关于要着重解决的问题提得比较一般的单位，占多数；虽经多次研究，但对情况了解还很不深不透，因而把整风规划订得过分笼统的单位，也占少数。许多单位都准备在今后进一步摸清情况，找矛盾，使得整风重点逐渐明确。
    在制定整风规划中，不少单位碰到这样的问题：整风运动先解决本部门工作中有关全国性的大政方针问题呢，还是先解决领导机关内部的思想作风方面的主要矛盾呢？有人认为必须首先解决前一个问题，因为这是中央国家机关整风运动的关键性问题。但是更多的人认为不能这样机械规定，虽然前一个问题是带有关键性的，但是领导机关内部的思想作风上的缺点不克服，也是不可能解决全国性的大政方针问题的。因此，整风首先解决那个问题，应由各机关根据具体情况决定，那个问题急需解决，就从那个问题入手。
    许多单位都认为：整风运动是马克思列宁主义的思想教育运动，因此在运动中，特别是运动开始时，深入学习整风文件，以消除顾虑，增强信心，是必要的。但学习整风文件不能机械地孤立地进行。在学习文件的同时，必须注意联系实际，特别是必须放手发扬民主，鼓励批评，让广大党内外干部大胆地“鸣”、“放”揭发各种矛盾。
    最近期间，科学院、邮电部、电力部、城市服务部等许多单位，都在学习文件的同时，有计划地召开了有科学家、民主人士和工程技术人员等参加的党内外各种座谈会，广泛征求意见。凡是党员负责干部能放手鼓励批评的单位，广大党外人士大都能畅所欲言，积极而又热诚的帮助共产党进行整风。电力部二十多个工程技术人员，在座谈会上畅谈党、群关系，提出了许多值得共产党重视和深思的问题。中国人民银行的党外人士向党员提出了尖锐的批评，使许多党员大吃一惊，感到问题严重，对整风运动很有帮助。目前还有个别单位的领导同志，不敢放手发扬民主、鼓励批评，不从实际出发，不走群众路线，只由少数领导人关起门来摸索主要矛盾，要群众孤立地学习文件，不让联系实际、揭露矛盾，结果，群众意见很多，主要矛盾也没有找出来。有些同志认为，邀请党外人士参加座谈会，批评党的缺点，是党外人士帮助共产党整风的重要方法。这种会议，不仅部一级可以召开，司局一级和司局以下各单位都可召开。另外，还可以用同党外朋友三五交谈、个别谈心和访问的办法来征求党外人士的意见。
