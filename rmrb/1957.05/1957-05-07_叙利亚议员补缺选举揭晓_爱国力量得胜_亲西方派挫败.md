Syrian By-Elections Revealed
	Patriotic Forces Triumph, Pro-Western Faction Defeated

	(Dispatch from our newspaper) Damascus News: The results of the Syrian parliamentary by-elections have been announced. Candidates supporting the current government's policies defeated their right-wing opponents, who were backed by Western countries, increasing the number of patriotic forces in the parliament by three seats.

	In the Damascus constituency, Riyad Malqi, a member of the Arab Ba'ath Socialist Party and a candidate of the patriotic "National Front," defeated Sibai, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood and a candidate of the right-wing United Front, to be elected as a member of the Syrian Parliament. Malqi received 20,929 votes, while Sibai received 18,457 votes.

	In the Homs and Suwayda constituencies, the left-wing candidates Kalalib and Asali also won victories.

	Elections in the Druze Mountains have also concluded. It is said that because elections there are more of a competition within tribes, they are not as closely related to party struggles.

	It is reported that the "National Front" candidate Malqi's election platform was to fully support Egypt and strongly condemn the "Eisenhower Doctrine," while the right-wing candidate Sibai focused his campaign on attacking communism, although he also had to express opposition to the "Eisenhower Doctrine" to please voters.

	Riyad Malqi is a young Syrian lawyer, 32 years old. He is the younger brother of Adnan Malqi, the former Deputy Chief of Staff of the Syrian Army. Adnan Malqi was a leader of the patriotic officers in the Syrian army who resolutely opposed joining foreign military treaties. He enjoyed great prestige in the army and among the people. In April 1955, he was assassinated by members of the National Socialist Party instigated by imperialists. The Arab Ba'ath Socialist Party, to which Malqi belongs, has always opposed imperialist aggressive blocs, opposed the Baghdad Pact, and advocated a policy of active neutrality, Arab unity, and alliance with Egypt.

	An Associated Press dispatch on May 5 admitted that the results of the Syrian parliamentary by-elections were a "bitter defeat for the right wing." In reality, it is another setback for Western countries in Syria.

	Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 6th May - According to Beirut Radio, the Syrian Foreign Minister, Mr. Bitar, stated in Damascus on May 4th that the Syrian government is investigating the purpose of the Turkish army's deployment on the Syrian border.

	Bitar told Arab newspaper reporters stationed in Damascus, "Information received from qualified sources indicates that land and sea exercises are underway." He said that the Syrian government has inquired about the purpose of the Turkish army's deployment through its plenipotentiary minister stationed in Ankara.

    叙利亚议员补缺选举揭晓
    爱国力量得胜　亲西方派挫败
    本报讯　大马士革消息：叙利亚议员补缺选举已经揭晓，支持现政府政策的候选人，击败了西方国家所支持的右派对手，从而使爱国力量在国会中增加了三席。
    在大马士革选区，阿拉伯复兴社会党党员、爱国的“民族阵线”候选人里阿德·马尔基击败了穆斯林兄弟会成员、右翼联合阵线的候选人西巴伊而当选为叙利亚国会议员。马尔基获得了二万零九百二十九票；西巴伊获得了一万八千四百五十七票。
    在霍姆斯和苏韦达两个选区，左翼候选人卡拉利布和阿萨利也都获得胜利。
    德鲁士山区的选举也已结束，据说由于这里的选举是部落内部的竞争，同党派斗争关系不大。
    据报道，“民族阵线”候选人马尔基的竞选纲领是全力支持埃及，全力谴责“艾森豪威尔主义”，而右派候选人西巴伊在竞选中则集中攻击共产主义，虽然他为了讨好选民也不得不表示反对“艾森豪威尔主义”。
    里阿德·马尔基是叙利亚的一位青年律师，现年三十二岁。他是叙利亚前陆军副参谋长阿德南·马尔基的弟弟。阿德南·马尔基是叙利亚军队中坚决反对参加外国军事条约的爱国军官们的领袖，在军队和人民中享有很大的威望，1955年4月被帝国主义者主使的国家社会党分子刺死。马尔基所隶属的阿拉伯复兴社会党，一向反对帝国主义侵略集团，反对巴格达条约，主张实行积极中立、阿拉伯团结和同埃及联盟的政策。
    美联社在5月5日的电讯中承认，叙利亚议员补缺选举的结果，是“右派的一个惨痛的失败”。实际上，也是西方国家在叙利亚的又一次挫折。
    新华社开罗6日电　据贝鲁特电台广播，叙利亚外交部长比塔尔5月4日在大马士革说，叙利亚政府正在调查土耳其军队在叙利亚边境集结的目的何在。
    比塔尔告诉驻大马士革的阿拉伯报纸记者说：“从有资格的人士那里得到的情报表明，陆上和海上的演习正在进行。”他说：叙利亚政府已经通过它驻在安卡拉的全权公使探询土耳其军队集结的目的。
