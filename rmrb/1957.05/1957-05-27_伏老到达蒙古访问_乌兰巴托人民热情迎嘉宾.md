Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, May 26th: Comrade Voroshilov arrived in Ulaanbaatar by plane this afternoon for a friendly visit at the invitation of Comrade Sambu, Chairman of the Presidium of the Great People's Hural of Mongolia. Approximately 50,000 working people of the Mongolian capital welcomed the Soviet head of state with the most solemn ceremonies and warm enthusiasm.

This morning, although snowflakes were fluttering in Ulaanbaatar, the working people of Ulaanbaatar City, dressed in new clothes and carrying red flags and flowers, went to the road leading to the airport early in the morning with fiery hearts to greet the distinguished guest. They stood on both sides of the approximately ten-li road from Ulaanbaatar City to the "Mongolian-Soviet Friendship" archway.

When Voroshilov's special plane landed, Sambu and party and government leaders such as Tsedenbal and Damba went to the plane to greet Voroshilov. Voroshilov, with a radiant face, stepped off the plane and embraced and kissed Sambu and Tsedenbal.

Voroshilov, accompanied by Sambu, reviewed the honor guard. As Voroshilov walked towards the welcoming crowd, bursts of cheers and applause erupted from the crowd. Children, young women, and the elderly excitedly stepped out of the crowd one by one and presented flowers to Voroshilov.

Sambu delivered a welcoming speech on behalf of the Mongolian government, the People's Revolutionary Party, and the Mongolian people, saying that the Mongolian people felt great joy today in receiving Comrade Voroshilov, an outstanding activist of the older generation of the Soviet party and state.

He said that under the influence of the October Revolution and with the help of the Soviet Union, the Mongolian people achieved the victory of the People's Revolution. Mongolia has made great achievements in economic and cultural construction over the past thirty-six years. This is inseparable from the Soviet Union's selfless and fraternal assistance. The recent talks between the Mongolian and Soviet governments and parties have contributed to strengthening the friendship between the two countries and strengthening the unity of the socialist camp. He said that Voroshilov's presence will further consolidate the long-tested friendship between the Mongolian and Soviet people.

Then, Voroshilov spoke, saying that coming to Mongolia was like coming to the home of an old friend. While the Soviet people congratulated the success of the Soviet-Mongolian talks, he once again expressed his personal congratulations. He said that the friendship between the Soviet Union and Mongolia, built up over thirty-six years of sharing weal and woe, will be further consolidated and developed.

Subsequently, Voroshilov, accompanied by Sambu and others, traveled by car from the airport to the guesthouse. There were welcoming crowds along the way. Herdsmen who had ridden horses from the countryside waved to Voroshilov to pay their respects. Workers and students cheered Voroshilov. They sang songs welcoming Voroshilov.

Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, May 26th: Chairman Voroshilov visited Comrade Sambu, Chairman of the Presidium of the Great People's Hural of the Mongolian People's Republic, at the Mongolian Government Building at 6:00 PM today.

Present on the Soviet side were Rashidov, Yelyutin, Fedin, and Soviet Ambassador to Mongolia, Pissarev. Present on the Mongolian side were Tsedenbal, Damba, Shirindib, Surenjav, Damdin, Dugersuren, and other party and government leaders.

Afterwards, Sambu invited Chairman Voroshilov to dinner.

On the same afternoon, Voroshilov laid a wreath at the mausoleum of Sukhe-Bator and Choibalsan.

In the evening, Tsedenbal and Damba paid a visit to Voroshilov.

    伏老到达蒙古访问
    乌兰巴托人民热情迎嘉宾
    据新华社乌兰巴托26日电　伏罗希洛夫主席今天下午坐飞机到达乌兰巴托。他是应蒙古大人民呼拉尔主席团主席桑布的邀请到蒙古作友好访问的。蒙古首都约五万劳动人民以最隆重的礼节热情地欢迎苏联元首。
    今天上午乌兰巴托虽然飘着雪花，但是乌兰巴托市的劳动人民一清早就穿上新衣，拿着红旗和鲜花，带着一颗颗火热的心，到通往飞机场的马路上迎候贵宾。他们伫立在从乌兰巴托市到“蒙苏友谊”牌楼的长约十里的马路两旁。
    伏罗希洛夫乘坐的专机着陆的时候，桑布和泽登巴尔、达姆巴等党政负责人到飞机前迎接伏罗希洛夫。伏罗希洛夫满面红光，走下飞机和桑布、泽登巴尔拥抱、亲吻。
    伏罗希洛夫由桑布陪同检阅了仪仗队。当伏罗希洛夫走向欢迎的人群的时候，人群里爆发出一阵阵的欢呼声和鼓掌声。孩子们、年青的妇女们和老人们一个个从人群中兴奋地走出来，把鲜花献给伏罗希洛夫。
    桑布代表蒙古政府、人民革命党和蒙古人民致欢迎词说，蒙古人民今天接待苏联党和国家的老一辈的杰出的活动家伏罗希洛夫主席感到极大的喜悦。
    他说，蒙古人民在十月革命的影响下和苏联的帮助下取得了人民革命的胜利。三十六年来蒙古在经济及文化建设方面获得了很大成就。这是和苏联大公无私的兄弟般帮助分不开的。不久前蒙苏两国政府和党的会谈对加强两国友谊和加强社会主义阵营的团结作出了贡献。他说，伏罗希洛夫的光临将更加巩固蒙苏两国人民久经考验的友谊。
    接着伏罗希洛夫讲话说，他们到蒙古来就像到老朋友家一样。在苏联人民祝贺苏蒙会谈成功的同时，他再一次表示他个人的祝贺。他说，苏蒙两国在三十六年中同甘共苦建立起来的友谊将更加巩固和发展。
    随后，伏罗希洛夫在桑布等陪同下乘汽车从飞机场到迎宾馆。沿途都有欢迎的人群。从乡下骑马赶来的牧民们向伏罗希洛夫挥手致敬。工人们、学生们向伏罗希洛夫欢呼。他们高唱欢迎伏罗希洛夫的歌曲。
    新华社乌兰巴托26日电　伏罗希洛夫主席今天下午六时到蒙古政府大厦拜会蒙古人民共和国大人民呼拉尔主席团主席桑布。
    苏联方面在场的有拉希多夫、叶留金、费德林和苏联驻蒙古大使皮萨列夫。蒙古方面在场的有泽登巴尔、达姆巴、锡林迪布、苏伦扎布、达姆丁、杜格苏伦及其他党政负责人。
    随后，桑布邀请伏罗希洛夫主席共进晚餐。
    同日下午，伏罗希洛夫到苏赫—巴托尔和乔巴山陵墓献了花圈。
    晚上，泽登巴尔、达姆巴拜会了伏罗希洛夫。
