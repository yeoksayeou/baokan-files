Xinhua News Agency Report:

    The All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Democratic Women’s Federation, and the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League of China are each deploying rectification movements. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the Women's Federation have initially drafted rectification plans and determined the focus of rectification.

    The Party Group of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, in discussing the rectification issue, believed that the All-China Federation of Trade Unions should focus on examining whether the Trade Union has played its due role in correctly handling contradictions among the people during the rectification movement? What further role should it play? The meeting requested that each department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions should first study the situation and identify the main problems before inspecting the work. The meeting determined that the rectification of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions should first be conducted among leading cadres at the level of deputy ministers and deputy chairmen of directly affiliated industrial unions and above. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions has already issued notices requesting leading cadres in charge of inspection work to return promptly to participate in the rectification. Currently, cadres of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions are studying Chairman Mao's two reports and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's instructions on the rectification movement, and have raised many questions. Lai Ruoyu, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, will give a report to cadres, mobilizing them to actively participate in the rectification movement.

    The Party Group of the All-China Women's Federation also held a meeting to discuss the rectification issue. The meeting believed that the All-China Women's Federation should focus on examining the problems of detachment from the masses and detachment from reality in the Women's Federation's leadership work during the rectification movement. Specific inspection content includes: problems existing in the Women's Federation's work in uniting women of all ethnic groups and all classes, caring for women, implementing the mass line, promoting democracy, and giving play to collective leadership. The Party Group of the Women's Federation requested that this inspection achieve the goal of improving thought and improving work. The meeting requested that the Women's Federation also study the reflection of contradictions among the people in the women's masses and in the Women's Federation organs during the rectification movement, as well as the issue of how to correctly handle contradictions. The meeting believed that the Women's Federation would convene the Third National Women's Congress in June this year. Therefore, it requested that the Women's Federation combine the work of rectification with the work of preparing for the convening of the Women's Congress during the rectification movement, so as to achieve "rectifying, doing, and correcting simultaneously." The Party Group of the Women's Federation will also hold a meeting to determine the specific plan for rectification.

    The Central Committee of the Communist Youth League is currently leading cadres in studying documents of the rectification movement and will convene a Party Congress to further mobilize and launch the rectification movement. The Central Committee of the Communist Youth League is also busy convening the Third National Congress of the Communist Youth League on the 15th. They plan to carry out the rectification movement in depth and systematically inspect work after the congress.

    总工会和妇联确定整风重点
    团中央党委将开党代表大会进行整风动员
    新华社讯　中华全国总工会、中华全国民主妇女联合会和中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会三个团体分别布置整风运动。全国总工会和妇联已初步拟定整风计划，确定了整风重点。
    全国总工会党组在讨论整风问题时认为，总工会在整风运动中应该着重检查工会在正确地处理人民内部矛盾问题上是否已起了应有的作用？还应进一步起什么样的作用？会议要求总工会各部门在检查工作前，要先研究情况，找出主要问题。会议确定，总工会的整风先在副部长和各直属产业工会副主席以上的领导干部中进行。总工会已通知下去检查工作的领导干部迅速回来参加整风。目前，总工会干部正在学习毛主席的两次报告和中共中央关于整风运动的指示，并已提出许多问题。总工会主席赖若愚将要向干部作报告，动员干部积极参加整风运动。
    全国妇联党组也开会讨论了整风问题。会议认为，全国妇联在整风运动中应该着重检查妇联领导工作上脱离群众、脱离实际的问题。具体检查内容是：妇联在团结各民族各阶层妇女、关心妇女群众、贯彻群众路线、发扬民主和发挥集体领导作用等方面所存在的问题。妇联党组要求通过这次检查，达到提高思想和改进工作的目的。会议要求妇联在整风运动中还要研究人民内部矛盾在妇女群众和妇联机关中的反映情况以及如何正确处理矛盾的问题。会议认为，今年妇联在6月份要召开第三次全国妇女代表大会。因此要求妇联在整风运动中要把整风和准备召开妇女代表大会的工作结合进行，做到“边整、边做、边改”。妇联党组还要开一次会议，确定整风的具体计划。
    青年团中央党委会正在领导干部学习整风运动文件，并将召开党代表大会，进一步动员展开整风运动。青年团中央还忙于在15日召开青年团第三次全国代表大会，他们计划在大会结束后再深入开展整风运动，系统检查工作。
