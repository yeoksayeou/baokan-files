    Academic Debate Must Be Linked to China's Reality
    Chen Da
    I wholeheartedly support the "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom" policy.
    First, I believe that "debate" must have a common direction. By direction, I mean the goal of our efforts. Our country is moving towards socialism, so all the work of our intellectuals, including teaching and research, should be carried out in the service of socialist construction. "Debate" must also revolve around issues related to all aspects of socialist construction, in order to serve socialism. By developing debate, so that truth becomes clearer through argument, all positive factors conducive to socialist construction can be encouraged and brought into full play as much as possible; and negative factors unfavorable to socialist construction can be reduced accordingly, or transformed into positive factors.
    Second, regarding the teaching work of social sciences, our debate should revolve around the issue of linking theory with practice. University courses generally focus on theory. Since the slogan of "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom" was put forward, all kinds of theories can be freely discussed, but they should also be linked to practice as much as possible. Social sciences in old China had many shortcomings, especially in the following two aspects: 1. Theory was divorced from practice; 2. Insufficient attention was paid to the facts of our own country. Thirty-five years ago, when I started teaching at Tsinghua University, I not only used foreign textbooks to teach foreign theories, but also cited foreign examples to prove the theories I was teaching. I gradually discovered that many theories were inconsistent with the facts and were not applicable to China. For example, when I talked about population issues, I noticed John Rae's theory. He pointed out that the land in the Hawaiian Islands was fertile, and food also increased greatly, but the population did not increase accordingly, mainly because the residents there did not like to have many children and grandchildren. Therefore, it strongly refuted Malthus' population theory. Furthermore, when I started teaching the history of the labor movement, the late Director of the International Labor Office, Thomas, happened to visit our country. He said that in the history of the French labor movement, printing workers often occupied a leading position; but I knew that the labor movement in Beijing had different experiences: at that time, the workers of the Danhua Match Factory repeatedly led other workers in launching a firm and unyielding heroic struggle to promote the movement to ban white phosphorus matches. Recalling these examples made me more clearly see the importance of linking theory with practice. Soon after I started teaching, I began to collect facts, especially facts about China's population and about Chinese workers. Due to the limitations of manpower and financial resources, my efforts were insignificant.
    The situation since liberation has been much better than before liberation, mainly due to the leadership of the Party and the People's Government. Teachers of social sciences in universities have gradually paid attention to the connection between theory and practice in their teaching. For example, during vacations, teachers and students often go to factories or rural areas to conduct field investigations to closely coordinate with theoretical teaching in the classroom. But it is not enough, and there are many problems. It is worth our study.
    Third, in the field of social sciences, because some very important surveys have not yet been conducted, and some basic facts are still lacking. Therefore, on some major issues concerning the national economy and the people's livelihood, everyone can only rely on subjective opinions to conduct empty debates. Since the 1953 national census, our country has not yet established a nationwide personnel registration system, so that reliable facts cannot be obtained regarding the population dynamics of the whole country. This registration system should at least include four items: birth, death, marriage, and migration. It should be established universally in towns and villages across the country. Relevant data should be collected seriously and continuously, and published regularly, for use by the state in making policy decisions and for academic research. Furthermore, in the process of gradually improving the lives of the people across the country on the basis of increasing production, a rational wage system must be established and improved. To solve this problem, we must conduct the following large-scale surveys, namely surveys on retail prices, household livelihoods, and living expenses. Because of the lack of these surveys, some people have to quote classics and make irrelevant empty discussions; some people still rely on scattered figures, patching them together to make unreliable estimates.展开争论是得不到于国家于人民有利的结果的。

### 学术争鸣必须联系我国实际

    学术争鸣必须联系我国实际
    陈达
    我衷心拥护“百家争鸣”的政策。
    第一，我认为“争鸣”要有一个共同的方向。所谓方向，是指努力的目标。我们国家正向社会主义迈进着，所以我们知识分子的各种工作，包括教学与研究，都应向着社会主义建设来进行。“争鸣”也必须围绕着有关社会主义建设各个方面的问题来展开，以便为社会主义服务。由于展开了争论，使真理愈辩愈明，则一切有利于社会主义建设的积极因素可以尽量得到鼓励与发挥；而不利于社会主义建设的消极因素可以相应地减少，或转化为积极因素。
    第二，关于社会科学的教学工作，我们的争论应该围绕着理论与实际联系这一问题。高等学校的课程，一般是注重理论的。自“百家争鸣”的口号提出来以后，各种的理论都可以自由地讨论了，但亦应尽可能地联系到实际。旧中国的社会科学是有许多缺点的，特别是关于下列两层：1，理论脱离实际；2，不注重本国的事实。三十五年以前，当我在清华大学开始授课时，我不但采用外国文教科书，讲授外国的理论，并援引外国的事例来证明我所讲授的理论。我逐渐地发现有许多理论是与事实不符的，是不适用于中国的。例如，当我讲人口问题时，我注意到约翰雷的学说。他指出夏威夷群岛的土地肥沃，食品也有大量的增加，但人口并不跟着增加，主要是因为该处的居民并不是喜欢多子多孙的。因此，有力地反驳了马尔萨斯的人口理论。又如，当我开始讲授工人运动史时，适值国际劳工局已故局长多玛来我国访问，他说，在法国工人运动史上，印刷工人常常是占着领导地位的；但我知道北京的工运有不同的经验：在那时，丹华火柴厂的工人屡次领导其他工人，对宣传禁止白磷火柴的运动，展开了坚强不屈的英勇斗争。我回想起这些例子，使我更清楚地看出理论联系实际的重要性。在我进行教学工作不久以后，我就着手事实的搜集，特别是关于中国人口及关于中国工人的事实。因限于人力与财力，我的努力是微不足道的。
    解放以来的情形比解放以前好多了，主要是由于党与人民政府的领导，高等学校里社会科学的教师们，已在讲授工作中逐渐注重理论与实际的联系了。如在假期内，教师与学生往往到工厂或农村去进行实地调查，来密切配合课堂的理论讲授。但是做得还不够，存在问题是很多的。值得我们研究。
    第三，在社会科学的领域内，由于有些很重要的调查尚未举行，有些基本事实尚付阙如。因此，关于国计民生的有些重大问题，大家还只好凭主观意见，进行空泛的争论。自1953年全国人口普查以来，我国尚未建立全国性的人事登记制度，以致对于全国的人口动态得不到可靠的事实。这种登记制度，至少应有出生、死亡、婚姻及迁徙四个项目，应在全国的市镇及乡村普遍地建立起来。并认真地连续搜集有关资料，按时发表，借供国家决定政策措施及学术研究之用。又如，在提高生产的基础上，逐步改善全国人民生活的过程中，必须建立与健全合理的工资制度。为解决这个问题，我们必须举行下列的大规模调查，即关于零售物价、家庭生计，及生活费的调查。因为缺乏这些调查，所以有些人只好引经据典作不着边际的空洞讨论；有些人还是依赖零星的数字，七拼八凑，作出不可靠的估计。在这种不务实际的基础上展开争论，是得不到于国家于人民有利的结果的。
