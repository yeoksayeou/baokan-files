Xinhua News Agency, May 18th: Chairman Liu Shaoqi met this afternoon with the delegation from the Lanka Sama Samaja Party of Ceylon, headed by N.M. Perera.

The Ceylonese Ambassador to China, Perera, was also present at the meeting.

The host and guests had a long conversation.

Chairman Liu Shaoqi extended a warm welcome to the guests. He said: Our two countries should cooperate in a friendly manner. "We are both free from foreign control and interference, and we can come and go freely and make friends freely."

N.M. Perera said: We have a common goal that unites us, which is to drive out imperialism. But, he said, "More importantly, China is already a fortress in Asia that can repel any aggression."

Liu Shaoqi said: "China is a large country, but not yet a strong one." He said that China is still very backward in economic and cultural terms. N.M. Perera then said: "But many Asian countries look up to China." He believes that China and India should be two countries that protect Asian countries from further aggression. Liu Shaoqi said: Asian and African countries should unite, rely on and help each other, and jointly oppose war, oppose imperialism, and oppose colonialism.

During the conversation, everyone agreed that Orientals should prevent imperialism from raising its head again in Asia. N.M. Perera said: American imperialism accepts many lessons from Britain and France, and its aggression is more cunning. Liu Shaoqi said: The United States is also stronger. Therefore, we must all unite and concentrate a lot of strength to fight against it.

That is to say, there must be a policy of unity domestically, and a policy of unity internationally.

The guests also mentioned that the economies of many Asian countries are developing in the same direction, so economic cooperation should be carried out. The host expressed the same view. Both sides stated that China and Ceylon conduct trade in accordance with the principles of equality and mutual benefit. The guests believed that China is very generous in trade, especially in selling rice to Ceylon. Liu Shaoqi said: "You are the same to us. When the imperialists did not sell rubber to us, you sold it to us. This is mutual help in times of difficulty." He said that it is possible to test who is a friend in times of difficulty.

N.M. Perera talked about the Ceylonese government's policy of active neutrality. This leader of the opposition in the House said that we support the government's foreign policy. Liu Shaoqi expressed his admiration and welcome for Ceylon's foreign policy.

The guests said that China has made great achievements in a short period of time, and they want to study and learn from China's experience. Liu Shaoqi asked the guests to look at both the good and bad aspects of China. He said: "We have many shortcomings and mistakes, and bureaucracy is very serious."

Liu Shaoqi pointed out that there is bureaucracy in capitalist societies, and there will also be bureaucracy in socialist societies. The question is how to deal with this bureaucracy. We are firmly opposed to it. But these struggles must be carried out appropriately and not go too far.

Liu Shaoqi said: Now meetings are being held in factories, rural areas, schools and government offices all over the country to criticize shortcomings and mistakes. There are millions of such meetings, and the spearhead of criticism is mainly directed at the leaders.

During the conversation, delegation member Robert Gunewardene talked about his recent visits to the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia.

The host and guests exchanged views on the parliamentary situations in China and Ceylon.

N.M. Perera presented gifts to Liu Shaoqi and expressed the respect and friendship of the people of Ceylon and the Lanka Sama Samaja Party to the Chinese people. Liu Shaoqi expressed his gratitude.

Also present at the meeting were Vice-Chairmen Li Jishen, Shen Junru, Chen Shutong, and Zhang Xiruo, Luo Longji, Qiao Guanhua, Qu Wu, Yu Xinqing, Wu Maosun, and Zhang Canming.

    刘委员长在接见锡兰新平等社会党代表团时说
    亚非各国要团结起来共同反对战争
    纳·马·佩雷拉说：中国已是亚洲的可以击退任何侵略的堡垒
    新华社18日讯　刘少奇委员长今天下午接见了以纳·马·佩雷拉为首的锡兰新平等社会党代表团。
    接见的时候，锡兰驻中国大使佩雷拉也在座。
    宾主进行了长时间的畅谈。
    刘少奇委员长向客人表示热烈欢迎。他说：我们两国应该友好合作。“我们都已不受外国人的控制和干涉，我们可以自由来往，自由交朋友了。”
    纳·马·佩雷拉说：我们有过共同的目标使我们联系起来，这就是把帝国主义驱逐出去。但是，他说：“更重要的是，中国已是亚洲的可以击退任何侵略的堡垒。”
    刘少奇说：“中国是大国，但是还不是强国。”他说，中国在经济和文化方面还很落后。纳·马·佩雷拉接着说：“可是亚洲很多国家都仰望着中国。”他认为，中国同印度应该是两个保卫亚洲国家不再遭受侵略的国家。刘少奇表示：亚非各国应该团结起来，互相依靠和援助，共同反对战争、反对帝国主义、反对殖民主义。
    谈话中大家都认为东方人应该防止帝国主义在亚洲重新抬头。纳·马·佩雷拉说：美帝国主义接受英国和法国的许多教训，它的侵略更狡猾。刘少奇说：美国也更强大。因此我们大家要联合起来，集中很多力量才能同它进行斗争。
    这就是说，在国内要有团结政策，在国际上也要有团结政策。
    客人们还谈到，亚洲许多国家的经济是朝着一个方向发展的，因此应该进行经济合作。主人表示持有同样的看法。宾主都表示中锡两国是遵循平等互利的原则进行贸易往来。客人认为中国在贸易中很慷慨，特别是卖大米给锡兰。刘少奇说：“你们对我们也是一样，当帝国主义不卖橡胶给我们的时候，你们卖给了我们。这是困难时的相互帮助。”他说，困难时是可以考验出谁是朋友的。
    纳·马·佩雷拉谈到锡兰政府奉行积极中立的外交政策。这位众院反对派领袖说，我们是拥护政府的外交政策的。刘少奇对锡兰这一外交政策表示钦佩和欢迎。
    客人们表示，中国在短短时间内取得了很大成就，他们要研究和学习中国的经验。刘少奇请客人在中国好的方面和坏的方面都要看。他说：“我们的缺点和错误很多，官僚主义很厉害。”
    刘少奇指出，在资本主义社会有官僚主义，在社会主义社会也会有官僚主义。问题是如何对待这官僚主义。我们是坚决反对它的。但是进行这些斗争要适当，不能过火。
    刘少奇说：现在在我们全国各地的工厂、农村、学校和机关都在开会批评缺点和错误，这种会有上百万个，而且批评的矛头主要是指向领导者。
    在谈话的时候，代表团团员罗伯特·古涅瓦德尼谈了他最近访问苏联和捷克斯洛伐克的观感。
    宾主交谈了中锡两国的议会情况。
    纳·马·佩雷拉向刘少奇赠送了礼品，并且表达了锡兰人民和锡兰新平等社会党向中国人民的敬意和友谊。刘少奇表示感谢。
    接见的时候，李济深、沈钧儒、陈叔通副委员长和张奚若、罗隆基、乔冠华、屈武、余心清、吴茂荪、张灿明也在座。
