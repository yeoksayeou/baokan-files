A Comprehensive Review by Our Newspaper Reporter: Recently, with the exception of a few units, the rectification leading groups of various ministries and commissions of the central state organs have invited non-Party cadres to seminars to help the Party with rectification. According to incomplete statistics, as of May 24, 55 units have held 118 symposiums, with more than 3,540 participants. The opinions of non-Party figures have greatly promoted the rectification movement and aroused great attention within the Party. Many leading Party cadres, after hearing criticism from outside the Party, felt that it was indeed impossible not to carry out rectification. Many practices that everyone had become accustomed to had a very negative impact on Party-masses relations. This proves that the bureaucratic, subjectivist, and sectarian errors within the Party are indeed very serious and must be rectified.

Judging from the current situation, the central state organs should more boldly allow everyone to speak their minds freely. The Party Committee of the Central State Organs also requires all units to come up with concrete measures to broaden avenues for speech and continue to implement the policy of "blooming and contending." In the previous stage, generally speaking, there was not enough "blooming." Most units' rectification leading groups resolutely implemented the policy of "blooming" and adopted many measures to listen to non-Party opinions. Non-Party figures also put forward many valuable opinions and sharp criticisms to the Party, but they did not finish what they wanted to say. According to the responsible comrades of the Party groups of the Ministry of Electric Power and the Ministry of Construction Engineering, which "bloomed" relatively well, non-Party comrades had only spoken about half of their thoughts. Moreover, the leading groups at the division and bureau levels of most units have not yet taken measures to solicit the opinions of non-Party comrades. Some units, although they held symposiums, the non-Party figures were not very enthusiastic in their speeches at the meetings and did not speak from the heart. This is mostly because the leading groups of these units have not fully realized the benefits of non-Party comrades' criticism for rectification, and they are still hesitant to let go and carry out criticism. They are afraid that too many opinions will cause chaos and hinder unity, or that the organization of the symposiums is not well done. There are also a few units that did not pay enough attention to the rectification movement in the previous period or were not determined enough and had many concerns. The leading groups were slow to act or even did not move until recently. The situation in these units has only changed in the last few days. Obviously, in these units, "blooming" has only just begun.

In the previous stage, most units were still studying documents within the Party. Although some units also exposed contradictions in connection with reality, they mainly focused on understanding the spirit of the documents. Only a few units also boldly carried out criticism within the Party at the same time. Most Party cadres now urgently want to speak and are unwilling to continue studying documents behind closed doors. This reflects the enthusiasm of Party comrades for the rectification movement. The stage of studying documents has been going on for quite some time, and documents should be repeatedly studied throughout the entire rectification process. Now, the leading groups of various units should pay attention to simultaneously listening to criticisms from non-Party comrades and boldly mobilizing Party members to actively carry out criticism and expose contradictions, so that the criticisms from inside and outside the Party can be appropriately combined to make the rectification movement more in-depth and more surging.

To boldly promote democracy, the leading groups need to take various measures to broaden avenues for speech based on the specific situation of their units. Judging from the situation in the previous stage, symposiums are a good form of promoting democracy. The Ministry of Electric Power held larger symposiums at the ministry level, and the bureaus and divisions held small symposiums at the same time; the Personnel Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Trade is preparing to hold symposiums on ten specific issues. These methods are all very good. However, some units seem to be holding symposiums just to meet the quota. They do not prepare well before the meeting, the main responsible Party cadres do not come forward to preside over the meeting, or too many people attend the meeting, often seventy or eighty people, or many responsible Party cadres go, but there are not many non-Party figures, making the comrades who attend the meeting feel inconvenient to speak. Some responsible cadres, seeing that non-Party figures do not speak much, feel that there are probably not many problems in their units, and even openly express this to non-Party figures. This approach not only fails to open up avenues for speech but also blocks them. In addition to symposiums, there are many other ways to listen to opinions. The leading groups should be good at arranging various opportunities for everyone to express their opinions, so that symposiums, individual talks, wall newspapers, blackboards... can all become forums for everyone to express their opinions, so that everyone can have the opportunity to express their opinions in the places they are willing to. A bureau of the Ministry of Electric Power held a symposium for senior intellectuals. Many people at the meeting were hesitant to speak, so they immediately changed their approach and had individual talks with these comrades. Some people did not speak much at the meeting, but individual talks lasted for a whole day or half a day. Some engineers from some ministries said that to listen to opinions, it is best to have heart-to-heart talks at home, so the leaders had heart-to-heart talks with them. These approaches are all worth promoting.

To boldly promote democracy does not mean giving up leadership. Giving up leadership will lead to deviations. Some units hold symposiums for non-Party figures, and the responsible Party cadres do not come forward to preside over the meeting, but ask the responsible non-Party cadres to preside over the meeting. As a result, everyone did not put forward much criticism to the Party, but sharply criticized the non-Party leading cadres, which is obviously very inappropriate. At present, some responsible Party cadres in individual units are busy with work or other reasons and have not spared a certain amount of energy to actively participate in the rectification. The leading groups should correct this phenomenon. After the masses are greatly mobilized, it is also possible that there will be a phenomenon of only focusing on rectification and neglecting work. These all require the Party to strengthen its leadership.

Recently, some ministries and commissions have conscientiously implemented the principle of checking and improving at the same time, which is the most effective measure to eliminate concerns and encourage everyone to carry out criticism. The rectification office of the State Planning Commission has established several groups to collect information separately and study issues such as personnel, administration, living welfare, confidentiality, documentation, and meeting system, and solve them immediately if they can be solved. Individual leading Party cadres in the State Planning Commission and the Ministry of Textile Industry have a bad style of work, and the masses have many opinions. In the past, everyone raised many opinions, but there was no significant improvement. At the beginning of this movement, they put down their airs and studied with the masses, listened to the opinions of the masses, and made self-criticisms to the masses. In all units that do this, the morale of the masses is very high, and concerns are naturally broken.

    中央国家机关党委会要求各单位
    放手发扬民主　多想办法广开言路
    各单位已开118次党外人士座谈会对整风起了极大推动作用
    本报记者综合述评　最近以来，中央国家机关除个别单位外，各部、委的整风领导小组都邀请非党干部座谈，帮助党整风。据不完全统计，截至5月24日，已有五十五个单位召开座谈会一百一十八次，参加人数有三千五百四十多人次。非党人士的意见，对整风运动起了极大的推动作用，在党内引起了极大的注意。许多党员领导干部听到党外的批评后，感到不整风的确不得了，许多大家习以为常的作法，在党群关系上起了很大的消极作用，这证明党内的官僚主义、主观主义和宗派主义错误的确非常严重，不整不成。
    就目前情况看，中央国家机关还应该更加放手地让大家畅所欲言。中央国家机关党委也要求各单位拿出具体措施，广开言路，继续贯彻大“放”大“鸣”的方针。前一阶段，一般说，还是“放”得不够。多数单位整风领导小组坚决执行了“放”的方针，采取了很多措施听取党外意见，非党人士也对党提出了许多宝贵的意见和尖锐的批评，但是，他们的话并没有讲完。据“放”得较好的电力部和建筑工程部的党组负责同志估计，非党同志的话也不过才讲了一半左右。而且，大多数单位司、局一级的领导小组，还没有采取措施征求非党同志的意见。有些单位，虽然召开了座谈会，但是非党人士在会上的发言很不踊跃，没有推心置腹地讲出自己的心里话。这大多是因为这些单位的领导小组还没有充分体会到非党同志的批评对于整风的好处，对于放手开展批评还有顾虑，他们怕意见多了会乱会妨害团结等等，或者是座谈会的组织工作作得不好。还有少数单位前一时期对整风运动不够重视或者决心不大顾虑很多，领导小组行动迟缓甚至迟迟不动，直到最近几天，这些单位的情况才有所改变。显然地，在这些单位，“放”才不过是刚刚开始。
    前一阶段，多数单位党内还在学习文件，虽然有些单位也联系实际揭露矛盾，但还是以领会文件精神为主。只有少数单位党内也同时放手开展批评。大多数单位的党员干部现在迫切要求发言，而不愿意再继续关门学习文件。这反映了党内同志对整风运动的热情。学习文件的阶段已经不短，而且在整个整风过程中都还应该反复精读文件。现在，各单位的领导小组应该注意在继续听取党外同志的批评的同时，也应放手发动党员群众，积极开展批评揭露矛盾，使党内外的批评适当地结合起来，使整风运动更加深入更加高涨。
    放手发扬民主，需要领导小组根据本单位的具体情况，采取各种措施广开言路。就前一阶段的情况看座谈会是发扬民主的一种好形式。电力部部一级召开较大型的座谈会，局司一级同时召开小型座谈会；对外贸易部人事局正在准备召开十种专门问题的座谈会。这些作法都是很好的。可是也有些单位召开座谈会似乎只是为了赶任务，会前不做很好准备，主要的党员负责干部不出面主持会议、或者参加会议人数过多，动辄七八十人，或者是党员负责干部去了很多，而非党人士不多，使参加会议的同志感到不便发言。而有些负责干部看到党外人士发言不多，就觉得本单位的问题大概不多，甚至公开向党外人士这样表示。这种作法不但不能开放言路反而会堵塞言路。除了座谈会，还可以有很多听取意见的办法。领导小组要善于为大家安排各种发表意见的机会、要使座谈会、个别谈心、墙报、黑板报……都成为大家发表意见的讲坛，使大家都能有机会在自己所愿意的场合发表意见。电力部的一个局召开了高级知识分子座谈会，会上很多人发言有顾虑，他们就立即改变办法，和这些同志个别谈心。有些人在会上不多发言，可是个别谈话一谈就是一天、半天。有些部的工程师表示，要听取意见，最好在家里促膝谈心，领导者就和他们一起谈心。这种作法都是值得提倡的。
    放手发扬民主不等于放弃领导，放弃领导就会发生偏差。有些单位召开非党人士座谈会，党员负责干部不出面主持，而请非党负责干部主持会议，结果，大家对党没有提出多少批评，却尖锐地批评了非党领导干部，这显然是很不恰当的。目前，个别单位的一些党员负责干部都忙于工作或其他原因，没有分出一定的力量来积极参加整风。领导小组应该纠正这种现象。当群众大发动以后，也很可能出现只顾整风而放松工作的现象，这些，都需要党加强领导。
    最近，有些部、会认真地贯彻了边检查边改进的原则，这是消除顾虑，鼓舞大家开展批评的最有效的措施。国家计划委员会整风办公室已经成立了几个小组，分头搜集情况，研究人事、行政、生活福利、机要、文书、保密、会议制度等问题，能够解决的就立即解决。国家计划委员会、纺织工业部都有个别党员领导干部作风不好，群众意见很多，过去大家提了很多意见，都没有显著改进。这次运动一开始，他们就放下架子，和群众一起学习，听取群众意见，向群众作检讨。凡是这样做的单位，群众的情绪都很高涨，顾虑自然也就打破了。
