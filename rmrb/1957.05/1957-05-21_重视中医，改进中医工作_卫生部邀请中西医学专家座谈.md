Emphasize Traditional Chinese Medicine, Improve TCM Work
Ministry of Health Invites Experts in Both Chinese and Western Medicine for Discussion

(Our Newspaper) The Ministry of Health, to solicit opinions on TCM work from various parties, invited seventeen experts in both Chinese and Western medicine for a discussion yesterday.

The experts in both Chinese and Western medicine who participated in the discussion unanimously agreed that since the criticism of He Cheng and Wang Bin's erroneous practices of discriminating against and excluding TCM, TCM work has greatly improved. However, because the health departments have not truly valued TCM work ideologically, many problems still exist.

TCM experts believe that the Ministry of Health's work on TCM remains superficial and based on subjective wishes, without properly studying and implementing TCM policies. Wang Boyue of the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine said that in recent years, health departments have absorbed tens of thousands of TCM practitioners, but the Ministry of Health is unaware whether these practitioners have been properly placed. He said that TCM currently lacks its own organization, a national publication, and even a place to debate and reflect ideological viewpoints is hard to find. There are few senior TCM leaders in TCM institutions. The Ministry of Health has not convened a TCM conference to date, reportedly because the Ministry fears that the conference would not solve problems, so it is better not to hold it. In fact, listening to everyone's voices could solve some problems. Dong Demao of the Beijing TCM Association said that the Ministry of Health rarely consults widely with TCM practitioners on TCM work, and when it does consult, it is often after the fact. Western medicine doctors learning TCM is an extremely important task, but few full-time cadres are assigned to teach TCM courses, resulting in low teaching quality. The Ministry of Health rarely actively addresses these issues. Xu Hengzhi of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Hospital said that the Ministry of Health's reluctance to intervene in the issues of TCM apprenticeship in Beijing indicates that the Ministry of Health does not value TCM work enough.

TCM experts criticized the Ministry of Health for not effectively leading the work of the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Wang Boyue said that comrades at the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine come from all directions, and everyone wants to contribute their own insights. However, for the past two years, no one has been clear about the Academy's direction and tasks, leading some experienced veteran TCM experts to merely treat senior cadres every day. Many TCM experts share the same opinion.

TCM experts suggested that the Ministry of Health should currently do everything possible to support TCM, train a large number of middle-aged TCM practitioners, and allow them to accept and inherit the experience of the older generation of TCM practitioners, to avoid severing the bridge. TCM experts also suggested compiling unified TCM textbooks and emphasized the importance of TCM practitioners learning modern medicine.

Western medicine experts generally believe that in launching the process of Western medicine doctors learning TCM, the Ministry of Health only emphasized Western medicine doctors learning TCM, without proposing that TCM practitioners should also learn Western medicine; relaxed ideological and political education for TCM practitioners; only emphasized promoting the scientific aspects of TCM, while criticizing the unscientific aspects insufficiently; and moreover, there were problems in leadership style, resulting in poor unity between Chinese and Western medicine. Jin Baoshan of Beijing Medical College said that for scientific methods in TCM, we should advocate and learn; for less scientific or even unscientific methods, it is better not to promote them. In the past, the Ministry of Health used political campaigns to launch Western medicine research, while also emphasizing Western medicine doctors learning TCM, but not allowing Western medicine doctors to ask questions. Long Bojian of the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine said that prohibiting debate between Chinese and Western medicine is unreasonable. Bi Dehua of Beijing Medical College said that currently only Western medicine doctors learning TCM is emphasized, but anyone with medical science knowledge believes that TCM has shortcomings and should be accepted with a critical attitude.

Fan Zhengding of Jiaodaokou Hospital said that the unity between Chinese and Western medicine is better than before, but it is still superficially united but divided at heart, sleeping in the same bed but dreaming different dreams. Western medicine doctors are afraid to speak to TCM practitioners, fearing being labeled with a "hat." Xu Zhengwen of Beijing Children's Hospital said that due to insufficient ideological and political education for TCM practitioners by the leadership, many of them are not at ease with TCM research work, look down on each other, do not seriously discuss and summarize experience, and cannot debate effectively, which also prevents them from improving quickly.

Everyone in their speeches also criticized the Ministry of Health's leadership for not effectively studying the situation, and for failing to properly resolve a series of issues such as the establishment of research institutions and the determination of learning methods. Xu Zhengwen said that the Ministry of Health's establishment of TCM colleges and other TCM institutions seemed to be only to rush to complete the tasks assigned by the central government, without being able to conduct practical and thorough consideration.

    重视中医，改进中医工作
    卫生部邀请中西医学专家座谈
    本报讯　卫生部为听取各方面对中医工作的意见，在昨日邀请了十七位中西医学专家举行座谈。
    参加座谈的中西医学专家一致认为：自从批判了贺诚、王斌歧视和排斥中医的错误做法以后，中医工作有了很大的改进，但是由于卫生部门还没有从思想上真正重视中医工作，因此，还存在许多问题。
    中医专家们认为卫生部对中医工作仍停留在表面上和主观愿望上，没有很好地研究贯彻中医政策。中医研究院王伯岳说，几年来，卫生部门吸收了几万中医工作，但这些中医是否安排得当，卫生部不得而知。他说，现在中医没有自己的组织，没有一份全国性的刊物，连争鸣和反映思想情况的地方都很难找。在中医机构里少有中医的高级负责人。到现在卫生部没有召开过中医会议，据说是卫生部怕开这个会不解决问题，不如不开，其实听听大家的呼声也是可以解决一些问题的。北京中医学会董德懋说，卫生部很少广泛地同中医商量中医工作，商量的时候，也多半是已成事实。西医学中医本是极重要的工作，但很少设专职干部教授中医课，以致教学质量不高，但卫生部门很少主动解决这些问题。中医学院的教学问题很少征求更多中医的意见。中苏友谊医院徐衡之说，卫生部不敢过问北京中医传习授徒中的问题，正说明卫生部对中医工作重视不够。
    中医专家们对卫生部没有很好地领导中医研究院工作提出了批评。王伯岳说，中医研究院的同志来自四面八方，每个人都想贡献自己的一得，但是，两年来，谁也不清楚研究院的方针、任务是什么，以致一些有丰富经验的老中医专家，每天只是给高级干部看病。许多中医专家也有同样的意见。
    中医专家们建议卫生部目前应尽一切可能扶持中医，大量培养中年中医，让他们接受和继承老一辈中医的经验，不要断了桥。中医专家还建议编写统一的中医教材和强调了中医学习现代医学的重要性。
    西医专家普遍认为卫生部在发动西医学习中医的过程中，只强调了西医学习中医，没有提出中医也要学习西医；放松了对中医的思想政治教育；只强调发扬中医方面科学的东西，而对其中不科学的东西批判不够；而且，在领导方式上存在问题，致使中西医不能团结得很好。北京医学院金宝善说，对中医科学的方法，我们应该提倡，应该学习；对于不太科学甚至是不科学的方法，还是不提为好。过去卫生部以搞政治运动的方式来发动西医研究，同时还强调西医学中医，但不准西医发问。中医研究院龙伯坚说，不准中西医争鸣，这是不合理的。北京医学院毕德华说，目前只强调西医学中医，但凡是有医学科学知识的人，都认为中医是有缺点的，应当用批判的态度去接受。
    交道口医院范正定说，中西医团结比以前好，但是仍然是貌合神离，同床异梦。西医不敢对中医讲话，怕戴“帽子”。北京儿童医院徐政闻说，由于领导上对中医的思想政治教育不够，他们有不少人不安心于中医研究工作，互相瞧不起，不认真讨论研究和总结经验，不能很好争鸣起来，这也使他们提高不快。
    大家在发言中，也批评卫生部领导上没有很好研究情况，对于研究机构的建立以及学习方法的决定等一系列问题，未能得到很好的解决。徐政闻说，卫生部成立中医学院等中医机构，似乎是为了赶中央所交给的任务，没有能进行切实的周到的考虑。
