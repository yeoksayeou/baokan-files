Xinhua News Agency, 28th - The All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, the All-China Youth Federation, the All-China Students' Federation, and the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, and other people's organizations' leaders today issued written statements, unanimously supporting the patriotic anti-American struggle of the Taiwanese people.

	The All-China Federation of Trade Unions representative in the conversation, on behalf of the national workers, expressed respect to the Taiwanese compatriots struggling against the American aggressors. He pointed out that although American imperialism has occupied China's territory of Taiwan with its military power, the people of Taiwan will not be conquered. They will follow the path taken by the people of the mainland and drive the American aggressors out of Taiwan, just as they drove the American aggressors out of the mainland.

	The All-China Democratic Women's Federation representative said that the Liu Ziran murder case was just one of the countless crimes committed by the American military in Taiwan, including the killing of our compatriots and the raping of our women. But the sisters of Taiwan have a patriotic tradition and cannot tolerate the oppression of American imperialism for long. The heroic struggle carried out by the Taiwanese compatriots this time is proof of that. The representative also said, "Taiwanese compatriots! Sisters! We will join all our compatriots on the mainland to support you with all our strength, drive American imperialism out of Taiwan, and allow the Taiwanese compatriots to return to the embrace of the motherland as soon as possible."

	The All-China Youth Federation representative pointed out in his speech that the American aggressors have long occupied China's territory of Taiwan, causing the Taiwanese compatriots to live in dire straits. Now they are recklessly declaring the American soldier who killed a Chinese compatriot innocent. This is a great contempt and provocation to the Taiwanese people, and thus to the entire Chinese people. Every Chinese person with blood in their veins cannot tolerate such willful atrocities by the American aggressors. The patriotic anti-American demonstrations of the Taiwanese compatriots are just, and the Taiwanese youth stand at the forefront of the struggle, fully demonstrating the heroic spirit of the Chinese sons and daughters. We, the youth on the mainland, resolutely support the just struggle of the Taiwanese compatriots and youth, and express our highest respect to them.

	The All-China Students' Federation representative said that the Shen Chong rape case by an American soldier in 1946 aroused the anger of the people across the country and set off a massive "Anti-Atrocity Movement" among students nationwide. At that time, the American imperialists and Chiang Kai-shek tried everything possible to suppress the patriotic movement of the Chinese people, but they suffered a shameful defeat and were finally driven out of the Chinese mainland. Now, the case of Reynolds shooting and killing Liu Ziran has triggered the outbreak of anti-American sentiment among the Taiwanese people. The slogan "Yankees go home!" has swept Taiwan. We believe that with the unity and heroic struggle of the Taiwanese people and the entire Chinese people, the American aggressors will once again suffer a shameful defeat, and Taiwan will surely return to the embrace of the motherland!

	The All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese representative pointed out that the patriotic anti-American struggle of the Taiwanese compatriots not only demonstrates the Chinese people's unparalleled hatred for the American aggressors, but also makes a direct contribution to the upsurge of the global movement against colonialism and American aggression and expansion. Not only do we overseas Chinese and the 600 million people on the mainland express our firm support, but it is also supported by all peace-loving people with a sense of justice in the world. He also said that driving the brutal American aggressors out of Taiwan is the desire of the eight million Taiwanese compatriots and the unwavering will of the entire Chinese people. Peaceful liberation of Taiwan and the realization of the great unity of the motherland is the sacred task of the Chinese people. We must fight to the end!

    全国一致声援台湾同胞反美斗争
    各人民团体号召把反美爱国斗争坚决进行到底
    新华社28日讯　中华全国总工会、中华全国民主妇女联合会、中华全国民主青年联合会、中华全国学生联合会和中华全国归国华侨联合会等人民团体负责人今天分别发表书面谈话，一致声援台湾人民的爱国反美斗争。
    中华全国总工会负责人在谈话中代表全国工人向为反对美国侵略者而斗争的台湾同胞表示敬意。并指出，美国帝国主义虽然用它的军事力量占领了我国的领土台湾，但是，台湾的人民是不会被征服的，他们将沿着祖国大陆人民走过的道路，像把美国侵略者赶出大陆去一样把美国侵略者赶出台湾去。
    中华全国民主妇女联合会负责人说，美军杀害刘自然的事件，只是美军在台湾所犯无数次杀害我国同胞、强奸我国妇女的罪行中的一件。但是台湾同胞姊妹是有爱国传统的，是不能长期忍受美帝国主义的压迫的，这次台湾同胞所进行的英勇斗争就是一个证明。负责人又说，台湾同胞们！姊妹们！我们将和大陆上所有同胞一起，以一切力量来支援你们，把美帝国主义赶出台湾去，使台湾同胞早日回到祖国的怀抱。
    中华全国民主青年联合会负责人在发言中指出，美国侵略者长期霸占我国领土台湾，使台湾同胞生活在水深火热之中，现在又肆无忌惮地宣判杀害中国同胞的美国军人无罪，这是对台湾人民也就是对全中国人民极大的藐视和挑衅。每一个有血性的中国人，决不能容忍美国侵略者这种恣意的暴行。台湾同胞的爱国反美大示威是正义的，台湾青年在这次事件中站在斗争的最前列，充分表现了中华儿女的英雄气概。我们在大陆上的青年，坚决支持台湾同胞和青年的正义斗争，并向他们表示最崇高的敬意。
    中华全国学生联合会负责人说，1946年美军强奸北大学生沈崇事件激起了全国人民的愤怒，在全国学生中掀起了声势浩大的“抗暴运动”。当时美帝国主义者和蒋介石想尽一切办法来镇压中国人民的爱国运动，但是他们遭到了可耻的失败，最后被赶出了中国大陆。现在雷诺枪杀刘自然案件，引起了台湾人民反美情绪的爆发，“美军滚出去！”的口号已经席卷台湾。我们相信，在台湾人民和全中国人民团结一致、英勇斗争下，美国侵略者一定要再一次地遭到可耻的失败，台湾一定要回到祖国的怀抱！
    中华全国归国华侨联合会负责人指出，台湾同胞的爱国反美斗争，不仅表现了中国人民对美国侵略者无比的愤恨，同时对全世界反对殖民主义、反对美国侵略扩张运动的高涨，也是直接的贡献。不但我们华侨和大陆上六万万人民表示坚决支持，而且受到世界各国有正义感的爱好和平的人民的支持。并说，把残暴的美国侵略者赶出台湾，是八百万台湾同胞的愿望，也是全中国人民不可动摇的意志。和平解放台湾，实现伟大祖国的统一，是中国人民的神圣任务。我们一定要斗争到底！
