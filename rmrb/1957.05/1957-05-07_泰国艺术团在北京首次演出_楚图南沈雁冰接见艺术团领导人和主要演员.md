Xinhua News Agency, 6th: The Thai Art Troupe gave its first performance in China tonight at the Tianqiao Theater in Beijing, to the applause and cheers of over a thousand spectators. ?Suvat Voradilok, head of the art troupe, said that although the people of China and Thailand have a long history of cultural ties, sending such a strong art troupe to visit China is a first in the history of the two countries.

A grand opening ceremony was held before the performance. Yang Hansheng and ?Suvat Voradilok both spoke at the opening ceremony. Yang Hansheng believes that the Thai Art Troupe's visit to China is a great event in the history of cultural exchange between China and Thailand.

Chu Tunan, President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, and Shen Yanbing, Minister of Culture, met with the leaders and principal performers of the art troupe during the intermission.

Thai artists comprehensively introduced diverse Thai arts to the Beijing audience tonight - classical dance, folk music, mime, singing, martial arts, etc. The performance of traditional Thai instruments - the bamboo xylophone and the Angklung - was a great success. Thai songs sung by the queen of song, Pinsi Gongchusi, and "The Sun Rises on the Grassland" sung in Chinese by the king of song, Nai Suthep, were warmly welcomed. They both sang them again at the request of the audience.

Thai film queen Suphan Buranaphim女士 and dancer Pink女士 performed the classical court dance "Lochana Chooses a Husband."

The main performer of the rough and thrilling Thai sword dance, the young martial artist Nai Mongkol Chanthanawupa, has fifteen years of martial arts experience.

The last and most popular program was the chorus "China and Thailand are One Family." As soon as the singing started, two Thai artists walked onto the stage holding the national flags of Thailand and China high. At this moment, singing and applause from the stage and below competed, becoming louder and louder. At the end of the singing, the audience all stood up, and Chu Tunan, Shen Yanbing, Mei Lanfang and others went on stage to shake hands with the Thai artists. Chinese literary and art workers presented flowers to all the Thai artists. Then the Thai artists cheered "Friendship" and "Long live" in Thai and Chinese, and the sounds resounded as one.
