The author points out: The erroneous ideas in the articles by Chen Yi and Chen Qitong are representative; literary and artistic workers and scientists should muster their courage to remove the obstacles on the road.

Last summer, as soon as the Party Central Committee put forward the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," the broad masses of literary and art circles and science circles across the country immediately responded with thunderous applause—a sound that truly came from the bottom of everyone's heart.

However, this wise and timely cultural policy was not welcomed by everyone with open arms. For some leading comrades, it was not to their taste. They were suspicious in their hearts, or simply did not agree, of course they would not say it straightforwardly in public. Their idea was that the implementation of this policy would be beneficial to those literary and artistic workers and scientists, but what good would it do for the Party? (They separated the interests of the Party from the broad masses of intellectual laborers like this!) In their work, it would also bring them a lot of trouble. The simple command-style approach would no longer work, and the idea of ​​being the only one who is right had to be changed. In many places, there would have to be consultations, reasoning, and free competition. This was not only troublesome, but simply too difficult! What was wrong with the old ways? Why ask for trouble! Why seek suffering!

Some leading comrades were even more worried. They thought that in this way, it would be like breaching the Yellow River's dikes, and the turbid and rushing river water would immediately flood and cause disaster! The revolutionary achievements that had been painstakingly obtained over the years would be destroyed in this way! How sad! ...

Due to the existence of such ideas, they naturally would not do their best to promote the Party Central Committee's effective policy to promote the prosperity of literature and art and science. They adopted a cold or dismissive attitude towards it. Even if the masses put forward sincere requests, they might as well just "ignore" them.

This situation may not be very common, but it will not just be isolated cases. We know that some universities did not conduct more serious publicity work or strive to take effective measures to promote the timely realization of this policy in the six months after Minister Lu Dingyi's report was published. On the contrary, in some respects, some responsible comrades showed an attitude contrary to the spirit of this policy, unwilling to let the masses express their opinions, and made arbitrary decisions on issues on which the broad masses had different opinions.

We also know that some newspaper and magazine editors still arbitrarily reject manuscripts that do not conform to their own opinions. They have many very narrow frameworks for the content and style of articles. If your work does not fit into it, then you deserve to be unlucky!

Examples cannot be exhausted. In short, although the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" was put forward by the Party Central Committee, and the broad intellectual circles also expressed their heartfelt support, its implementation was not so smooth. At least, in some departments, it seemed like the moon in the water, visible but unattainable. The erroneous ideas in the articles by Comrades Chen Yi and Chen Qitong are now known to everyone. But that is by no means the private property of just those few comrades. Behind them there is a large "mass." Some of the opinions of these "masses" are even more intense than those of the few of them, but they have not been published publicly in the "People's Daily" or "Study" magazine.

Precisely because of this, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao had to repeatedly explain this policy, which is related to the entire country's cultural life, to arouse further attention from all cadres and intellectuals. Chairman Mao spoke about this issue at several important meetings. He thought deeply and spoke earnestly. He not only accurately explained the far-reaching significance of this policy, but also pertinently criticized those "left" or right erroneous opinions. After directly or indirectly hearing Chairman Mao's speech, thousands upon thousands of literary and artistic workers and scientists felt more deeply than ever what a wise and outstanding leadership we have in our country! They felt how this leadership was paying attention to the dynamics of the people's material and spiritual lives at every moment! How they cared about the feelings and fate of the broad masses of intellectuals at every moment! They were all determined to further transform themselves in order to better serve the motherland. Many of them had tears of gratitude and joy in their eyes while making their resolutions.

In the past month or two, we have also seen obvious changes in the leadership work of some agencies. The leading comrades in those agencies usually ignored the opinions of the masses, and even ignored the existence of the masses. However, after the Supreme State Council, especially after the Party Central Committee's Propaganda Work Conference, this situation changed rapidly. They listened to the criticisms and suggestions of the masses. Even very small problems were noted and dealt with. Naturally, this is just a beginning, the bud of a flower that is about to bloom. However, it shows the importance that those leading comrades attach to the Party Central Committee's policies, and it also shows their sense of responsibility for the healthy development of the people's cause. This attitude of daring to improve is worthy of praise.

However, regrettably, we still see other situations. Some leading comrades in some agencies did not have any active response to Chairman Mao's repeated and earnest speeches. Their self-made fear psychology is still quite strong. It is said that some responsible comrades even admitted that the current "blooming and contending" has reached the proper extent, and the problem in the future lies only in how to deal with the aftermath. This estimate of the status quo is different from Chairman Mao's estimate and from the estimate of most of us. Therefore, of course, in practice they will never do things that are in line with Chairman Mao's instructions. At present, in some places, we can still clearly see the practice of replacing the opinions of the broad masses with the opinions of individuals or a small number of people that are not reliable.

If we use a Tang Dynasty poem to describe the current situation in academic and cultural circles, it may be said that "the sun rises in the east while it rains in the west."

This reminds me of the speeches of some insightful comrades at a meeting discussing Chairman Mao's speech not long ago. They said that Chairman Mao had said everything that could be said about the principles of "blooming and contending." The problem lies in the implementation of the responsible comrades below in their actual work in the future! When they spoke, their faces were pleasant, but they had a bit of melancholy in their expressions.

Of course, judging from the overall situation of our country, this policy is bound to be implemented sooner or later! We don't need to doubt this. However, we cannot be unconditionally optimistic either. Because, as mentioned earlier, are there not still people who are not interested in the propositions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, even today? And these comrades are often sitting in leadership chairs. It is no wonder that some people have a trace of shadow mixed in with their bright hope.

The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao are committed to this policy. They will also use all their strength to create conditions for "blooming and contending" in literary and art circles and science circles. And countless wise responsible comrades inside and outside the Party will inevitably work towards this direction. This is something we can completely believe in and rely on most.

However, to implement this cultural policy of the Party, we also need the joint efforts of many parties. The literary and artistic workers and scientists involved naturally have their due responsibilities. And persisting in the struggle for truth is a very important point in their responsibilities. Although the earth has returned to spring, sometimes it is inevitable that there will be a cold snap or a little snow. To thoroughly implement the Party Central Committee's policy, resistance will still be encountered in some places. When encountering this situation, literary and artistic workers and scientists must, in accordance with the Party's instructions, muster their moral courage and unremittingly strive for its realization! We must remove those obstacles lying in the road so that true literature and art and science can move forward smoothly! Chairman Mao, at the Party Central Committee's Propaganda Work Conference, earnestly encouraged everyone to have the heart of a person with lofty ideals, and should not be afraid of anything in order to do a good job in the country's affairs. He also cited the heroic example of scholar Zhang Taiyan in the old democratic revolution era. Like many other speeches by Chairman Mao, this passage is also very rich in theoretical significance and practical value.

Without great courage, it is not easy to produce great and true art and science—this is the truth that history has taught us. This is the case from the perspective of creation and research itself, and it is also the case from the perspective of striving for conditions conducive to creation and research.

In our new society, although there are still some forces that are hostile to the truth, the era in which the upholders of the truth became tragic protagonists is over! Zhang Taiyan of our time will undoubtedly be happy.

The lighthouse of the wisdom of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao will always illuminate our way forward through the waves!

    破浪前进
    锺敬文
    作者指出：陈沂、陈其通文章中的错误思想，是有代表性的；文艺家科学家要鼓起勇气，除去路上的障碍物。
    去年夏天，党中央一提出“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，全国文艺界、科学界的广大人士马上就回报以雷响的鼓掌声——真正从各人心坎发出的声音。
    可是，这个明智的、适时的文化方针，并不是什么人都高举双手欢迎的。对于某些领导同志，它就不怎样适合胃口。他们心里怀疑，或者干脆不赞成，当然他们不会在公开的地方直率地说出来。他们的想头是，这种方针实行起来，对于那些文艺家、科学家是会有好处的，可是对于党有啥好处呢？（他们是这样把党和广大知识劳动者的利益截然分开的！）在工作上，还要给他们带来许多麻烦。简单命令的作法不行了，唯我独尊的想法要改变了。在许多地方，要商量，要讲道理，要自由竞赛。这不但麻烦，简直是太困难了！老一套有什么不好？何必自讨麻烦！何必自寻苦吃！
    有的领导同志忧虑更大。他们想，这样一来，就像决了黄河的堤防，那混浊奔腾的河水即刻会泛滥成灾！多年来辛苦得到的革命成果，就要这样被摧毁了！多可伤心！……
    由于这类思想的存在，他们自然不会尽力去推行党中央促使文艺、科学繁荣的有效方针。他们对它采取冷淡或抹煞态度。即使群众提出诚恳的要求，他们也不妨用“不理”了之。
    这种情形，不一定很普遍，可是，也不会只是个别的。我们知道，有些高等学校，在陆定一部长的报告发表后半年中，就没有作过比较认真的宣传工作，没有努力采取有效的措施去促进这个方针的及时实现。反之，在某些方面，有的负责同志倒表现了跟这个方针的精神相背的态度，不愿意群众表示意见，对于那些广大群众有不同意见的问题，作了专断的决定。
    我们又知道，有些报刊的编辑人，仍然随意排斥那些不合自己成见的稿件。他们对于文章的内容和体裁等，有许多非常狭窄的框子。你的作品如果镶不进去，就算你活该倒霉了！
    事例不能尽举。总之“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，虽然由党中央提出了，广大的知识界也表示了衷心的拥护，可是，在实行上并不是那样一帆风顺的。至少，在某些部门，它好像水里的月亮，看得见，捞不上。陈沂、陈其通诸同志文章中的那些错误思想，现在大家都知道了。但是那决不只是他们几位同志所专有的私产。他们的背后是有着广大“群众”的。这些“群众”里有些人的意见，比他们几位的还要激烈得多，不过没有在“人民日报”或“学习”杂志上公刊出来罢了。
    正因为这样，党中央和毛主席对于这个关系着整个国家文化生活的方针，不能不反复加以阐明，去唤起全体干部和知识分子的进一步的注意。毛主席在几个重要的会议上都讲到这个问题。他思深虑远，语重心长。他不但精确地说明了这个方针的深远意义，也中肯地批评了那些“左”或右的错误意见。千千万万的文艺家、科学家，在直接或间接听了毛主席的讲话之后，都更一次深刻地感到我们国家有着一个怎样智慧高迈的首脑部！感到这个首脑部怎样在每一个时刻里注视着人民物质和精神生活的动静！怎样在每一个时刻里关心着广大知识分子的心情和命运！他们都决心要进一步改造自己，以便更好地为祖国服务。其中有不少人在下决心的同时，眼里还噙着感激的、欣喜的眼泪。
    一两个月以来，我们也看到某些机关的领导工作有了明显的变化。在那些机关里的领导同志，平常忽视群众的意见，甚至于忽视了群众的存在。但是，在最高国务会议以后，特别是在党中央宣传工作会议以后，这种情形有了急遽的改变。他们倾听群众的批评和建议。即使是很细小的问题，也加以注意和处理。自然，这还不过是一个开始，是一朵将要盛开的花的蓓蕾。可是，它显示了那些领导同志对于党中央政策的重视，同时也就表明了他们对于人民事业健旺的责任感。这种勇于迁善的态度是值得表扬的。
    可是，遗憾的，我们还看到另外一些情形。有些机关里的领导同志，对于毛主席一再苦口婆心的讲话，没有什么积极反应。他们自造的恐惧心理还相当坚固。据说，有的负责同志，竟承认目前“齐放、争鸣”已经达到应有程度了，今后的问题只在于怎样善后。这种对现状的估计，是跟毛主席的估计，跟我们大多数人的估计不同的。因此，当然他们在实际上决不会作出符合毛主席指示的事情来。目前，在有些地方，我们还分明可以看到那种以个人或少数人并不可靠的意见去代替广大群众意见的作法。
    近日学术界、文化界的情形，如果借一句唐人诗句来形容它，也许可以说是“东边日出西边雨”。
    这使我想起不久之前，在讨论毛主席讲话的一次会上，某些富有见识的同志的发言。他们说，关于“齐放、争鸣”的道理，毛主席说得再好没有了。问题在于往后下面负责同志在实际工作上的贯彻！说话的时候，他们的脸色虽然是愉快的，可是多少带着一点忧郁的表情。
    当然，从我们国家的整个形势看来，这个方针迟早是必然要贯彻的！我们不用怀疑这点。可是，也不能够无条件地乐观。因为像前面所提到的，不是直到今天，还有人对党中央和毛主席的主张不感觉兴趣么？而这些同志又往往是坐在领导的交椅上的。这就难怪有些人在明朗的希望中要夹着一丝阴影了。
    党中央和毛主席是坚持这个方针的。他们也将用一切力量为文艺界、科学界创造“齐放、争鸣”的条件。而党内外无数明智的负责同志也必然要朝着这个方向去努力。这是我们完全可以相信的，也是最足依赖的。
    但是，要贯彻这个党的文化方针，还需要多方面的共同尽力。当事人的文艺家、科学家自然有他们应尽的责任。而坚持为真理而斗争，就是他们所负责任中很重要的一点。大地虽然已经回春，有时还不免来一阵阴寒或小雪。要彻底执行党中央的方针，在某些地方是还会遇到阻力的。碰到这种情况，文艺家、科学家们就必须根据党的指示，鼓起道德的勇气，不屈不挠地争取它的实现！一定要除去那些横在路上的障碍物，使真正的文艺、科学能够顺利地前进！毛主席在党中央宣传工作会议上的讲话，谆谆勉励大家，要有仁人志士之心，为了搞好国家的事情，不应该害怕什么。他还举出了在旧民主主义革命时代的学者章太炎的英雄榜样。像毛主席别的许多发言一样，这段话也是非常富于理论意义和实践价值的。
    没有大勇，就不容易产生伟大、真实的艺术和科学——这是历史所教导我们的真理。从创作和研究本身上说是这样，从争取有利于创作、研究的条件上说，也是这样。
    在我们的新社会里，尽管暂时还存在着某些跟真理敌对的力量，但是那些使真理的坚持者成为悲剧主人翁的时代已经过去了！我们时代的章太炎，无疑将是幸福的。
    党中央和毛主席的智慧的灯塔，永远照耀着我们乘风破浪前进！
