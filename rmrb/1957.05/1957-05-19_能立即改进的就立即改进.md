Improve What Can Be Immediately Improved
            People's Daily Commentator

    The Peking University Party Committee invited heads of various democratic parties within the university to a forum on the afternoon of the 17th. At the meeting, Jiang Longji, the person in charge of the university's Party Committee, responded to the criticisms and opinions raised by everyone since the rectification campaign. In the spirit of rectifying and improving work simultaneously, he announced that a decision had been made to apologize at the same meeting to several professors who had been wrongly struggled against in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries campaign, and to restore their reputations. He also expressed that opinions that could be immediately improved would be resolved immediately.

    At a forum hosted by the Party Group and Party Committee of the Ministry of Chemical Industry to invite comrades from democratic parties in the ministry, Peng Tao, the responsible comrade of the Ministry of Chemical Industry's Party Group, also expressed to everyone that anything that could be immediately improved would be immediately improved. For example, comrades from the China Democratic League criticized that the Communist Party organization had not created conditions for the activities of democratic parties. At the end of the meeting, Vice Minister Liang Yingyong stated that the administrative department would immediately study ways to provide support. Some comrades criticized that the ministry's introduction letters were all printed with the words "Party Member" and "League Member." If the comrade going out was not a Party or League member, they would cross it out and add the words "Masses." This practice made non-Party comrades very unhappy. On the 16th, the Ministry of Chemical Industry canceled this type of introduction letter.

    This approach is very good. Currently, many leading organs and universities are holding various forums to listen to the opinions of non-Party comrades and lower-level units. A large number of criticisms and suggestions have been placed before leaders at all levels. How should these opinions be treated? The vast majority of these opinions are correct and should be adopted. Of course, some of these issues are more complex and cannot be resolved immediately, or cannot be fully resolved immediately. Such issues naturally need to be gradually resolved after careful study. However, some issues are very obvious, the situation is not complicated, and it is not difficult to resolve them. It is best to resolve such issues immediately, like Peking University and the Ministry of Chemical Industry have done. Judging from the opinions that have already been put forward by various parties, there are quite a few such issues. For example, publicly apologizing to those comrades who have been wronged in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries campaign but have not been publicly apologized to, not showing non-Party comrades documents that they should see, not allowing non-Party comrades to participate in meetings that they should participate in, not asking for instructions or reporting to non-Party comrades on matters that should be requested or reported, etc. These should all be immediately accepted and immediately improved.

    Aren't there some comrades both inside and outside the Party who are afraid that the rectification movement will not solve problems? Improving what can be improved immediately and solving what can be solved immediately is the most effective way to eliminate concerns. Failing to address problems that can be resolved immediately will inevitably dampen the enthusiasm of some comrades and make people doubt the leaders' determination to correct shortcomings. If leaders express their intention to eliminate bureaucracy, call on everyone to expose and criticize bureaucratic phenomena, while at the same time watching certain obvious bureaucratic phenomena that can be immediately corrected continue to exist, it is conceivable that this situation will not be conducive to the progress of the rectification movement.

    能立即改进的就立即改进
            本报评论员
    北京大学党委会17日下午邀请校内各民主党派负责人等座谈，会上，该校党委负责人江隆基，对整风以来大家提出的批评和意见分别作了解答。他本着一面整风一面改进工作的精神，他宣布，对在肃反运动中曾经被错斗的几个教授，决定在同样的会议上向他们道歉，恢复他们的名誉。对于一些可以马上改进的意见，他也表示马上解决。
    化学工业部党组和党委在邀请部里民主党派的同志座谈会上，化工部党组负责同志彭涛也向大家表示，凡是可以立即改进的事情就立即改进。如民盟的同志批评共产党组织没有替民主党派的活动创设条件，在会议结束的时候，副部长梁膺庸就表示行政方面将立即研究办法给予支持。有的同志批评部里的介绍信都印好了“党员”“团员”的字样，如果外出的同志不是党团员，就划掉另加“群众”二字。这种作法使非党同志很不愉快。16日，化工部就取消了这种介绍信。
    这种作法很好。现在，许多领导机关和高等学校都在举行各种座谈会听取党外同志以及下级单位的意见。大量的批评和建议摆在了各级领导者的面前。应该怎样对待这些意见呢？这些意见绝大部分是正确的，应该被采纳的。当然，其中有些问题比较复杂，不是马上能够解决的，或者不是马上能够完全解决的。对于这类问题自然需要经过仔细研究以后逐步解决。但是，有些问题是非非常明显，情况也不复杂，解决起来并不困难，像这样的问题最好是像北京大学和化工部这样立即予以解决。就目前各方面已经提出的意见看，像这样的问题是不少的，比如应该向那些在肃反运动中受到委曲的同志当众道歉的而没有当众道歉，应该看的文件不给非党同志看，应该参加的会议不让非党同志参加，该向非党同志请示报告的事情不请示报告，等等，这些都是应该马上接受批评马上改进的。
    不是党内外都有一些同志害怕整风运动不解决问题吗？能改进的立即改进、能解决的立即解决，这就是消除顾虑的最有效的办法。能够立即解决的问题不立即着手解决，难免会挫伤一些同志的积极性，会使人怀疑领导者改正缺点的决心。如果领导者一边表示要消除官僚主义现象，号召大家揭发批判官僚主义现象，一边却眼看着某些明显的可以立即纠正的官僚主义现象继续存在，可以设想这种情况是不会有利于整风运动的进行的。
