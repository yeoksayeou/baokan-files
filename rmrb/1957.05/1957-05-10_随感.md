    Random Thoughts

    Shaoxing folk song: "Adults' mistakes are talked about and let go, children's mistakes are punished with a spanking." Here, "adults" and "children," in the family, refer to elders and juniors; in society, they refer to officials on the bench and the common people below.
    This is naturally a portrayal of an undemocratic era. What about a democratic era? Should we reverse it and turn it into "children's mistakes are talked about and let go, adults' mistakes are punished with a spanking"? Children are ignorant and unknowing, inevitably saying strange things and uttering absurdities. Ignorance is not a crime, so why not be lenient? Adults are virtuous and respected, and should not speak nonsense. If they knowingly commit offenses, they should be dealt with severely. Therefore, it's not unreasonable that children who have been spanked enough suddenly demand to reverse and change things; even if it's close to being extreme, well, children have narrow horizons and small minds, so please be understanding.
    However, wouldn't the best way be to spare everyone, regardless of age, a spanking for saying the wrong thing? To say that the reason buttocks are covered with thick flesh is precisely for the purpose of receiving every single blow is a sad joke.

    绍兴歌谣：“大人话错话话过，小人话错打屁股”。这里的大人小人，在家庭里，指长辈晚辈；在社会上，指堂上的官吏阶下的百姓。
    这自然是不民主时代的写照。民主时代怎样呢？反其道而行之，变成“小人话错话话过，大人话错打屁股”吗？小人无知无识，难免说怪话，发谬论，不知不罪，何妨从宽；大人德高望重，不该胡言乱语，明知故犯，理合从严。所以，挨打挨够了的小人忽然要求这么反一反、变一变，未始没有道理；就算近乎过激，小人眼界小、器量小么，也是只好请予鉴谅的。
    然而，最好的办法，还是人不论大小，话错了一概免打屁股吧？说什么天生屁股之所以长着厚厚的肉，正是为了一五一十地挨打，那是可哀的笑话。
