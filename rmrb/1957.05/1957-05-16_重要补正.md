Important Correction

In the ninth paragraph of the transcript of Khrushchev's interview with the editor-in-chief of "The New York Times," after "However, if I said that the United Nations currently," it should read: "is an important tool in solving international problems, then I would be violating my conscience. He said that if the situation continues in which the United Nations is dominated by the United States, and the United States dictates to those countries that receive its charity, then this organization will essentially cease to be an international organization and become a branch of the United States.

Khrushchev also added that the Soviet Union is ready at any time to exchange views with other countries on issues such as disarmament, the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons, and the banning of nuclear weapons testing. We are ready at any time to negotiate on these issues and to reach reasonable agreements.

Catledge also asked Khrushchev if he really believed that the United States and its allies were planning to invade the Soviet Union? Is it correct to understand that the policies of the Soviet Communist Party and the government are to encourage people from all walks of life in the Soviet Union and other countries to interact freely with each other? Does he think the Soviet Union's censorship of foreign reporters is incorrect?

Khrushchev replied that, in his opinion, the fact that the United States and its allies are planning to invade the Soviet Union is beyond doubt. If a country does not intend to start a war, then it will not expand its armaments, but will seek reconciliation with others. Of course, the American people do not want war; they want peace and friendship between all peoples. But, unfortunately, they have almost no influence on American policy.

Khrushchev believes that Catledge's understanding of the Soviet Union's policy of encouraging free exchange between people of all countries is very correct. He said that the Soviet Union hopes to do so. As for the issue of censorship of foreign reporters, he said that the Soviet Union only implements censorship when dealing with defamatory news. Soviet officials suppress and do not publish incorrect and false news, which is beneficial to society.

    赫鲁晓夫答“纽约时报”总编辑问一稿第九段，“但是，如果我说联合国目前”之后应为“在解决国际问题方面是一个重要的工具，那我就违背了自己的良心。他说，如果在联合国这个组织里由美国支配一切，由美国对那些获得美国施舍的国家发号施令的局面继续存在下去的话，这个组织实质上就不成其为国际组织，而是美国的一个分部了。
    赫鲁晓夫还补充说，苏联准备随时同其他国家就裁减军备、禁止原子武器和氢武器、禁止试验核武器等问题交换意见。我们随时准备就这些问题进行谈判，准备达成合理的协议。
    卡特勒奇还问赫鲁晓夫，他是否真的认为美国和它的盟国正在打算侵略苏联？苏联共产党和政府的政策是鼓励苏联和其他国家的各界人士自由地互相往来，这样理解对吗？他是否认为苏联对外国记者实行的新闻检查制度是不正确的？
    赫鲁晓夫回答说，在我看来，美国和它的盟国正在打算侵略苏联，这倒是无可置疑的事实。如果一个国家不打算发动战争，那么它就不会去扩充军备，而是去寻求同别人的和解。当然，美国人民的确不希望战争，他们要求和平和各国人民友好。但是，遗憾的是，他们对于美国政策几乎毫无影响。
    赫鲁晓夫认为卡特勒奇对苏联鼓励各国人民之间自由交往的政策理解得很正确。他说，苏联希望这样做。至于对外国记者实行新闻检查制度的问题，他说，苏联只有在对待诽谤性的消息的时候才实行新闻检查，苏联的主管人员压住不正确的假消息，不发表它们，这对社会是有益的。”
