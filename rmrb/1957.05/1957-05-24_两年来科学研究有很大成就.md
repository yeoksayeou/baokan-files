Xinhua News Agency, May 23rd, reporter Yu Huiyin reports: A scientific army composed of scientific workers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, universities, and industrial departments has conducted many research projects with academic value and significance for national economic and cultural development in the past two years.

In basic theoretical research, achievements with a high academic level have been made in mathematics, such as the research on characteristic classes and cobordism classes in topology, and the theory of multivariate complex functions on typical domains; in mechanics, the research on anisotropic elastic bodies; in physics, the research on metal internal friction and the mechanical properties of metals, and heavy mesons and hyperons in cosmic rays; in biology, the research on electrophysiology of the central nervous system, muscle proteins, succinate dehydrogenase, and the mechanisms of differentiation and development in individual development, as well as some research in chemistry, geology, paleontology, paleoanthropology, meteorology, and other fields.

Some emerging disciplines and experimental techniques in natural sciences are being vigorously established in our country. In order to peacefully utilize atomic energy, our country is vigorously developing research in nuclear physics and radiochemistry, establishing various necessary experimental equipment, and training a group of experimental and theoretical cadres. The heavy water atomic reactor with a power of 7,000 kilowatts and the particle cyclotron capable of generating 25 million electron volts, which the Soviet Union is helping our country build, will be basically completed this year. Advanced research methods using radioactive isotopes have begun to be promoted and used in our country's geology, petroleum, power, metallurgy, health, and scientific research institutions.

The purification and single-crystal pulling of semiconductor germanium have both achieved good results, and germanium electronic materials have been trial-produced, laying a preliminary foundation for semiconductor technology. In terms of automation, a comprehensive remote control, signal, and measurement equipment suitable for power systems has been researched, trial-produced, and installed in the power systems of Beijing and Northeast China. An automatic adjustment device, the "Universal Corrector," has been researched and designed, and this equipment is being tested and operated at the Guanting Hydropower Station. New technologies such as fast universal electronic computers and electronics are also being actively prepared for establishment.

The ore dressing and smelting problems of the iron ore in the Baotou new iron and steel industrial base have been initially solved through the research of scientists. The research results confirm that fluorine-containing iron ore in Baotou can be smelted into very good pig iron. The ore dressing experiments for iron and copper in the ore of the Daye Iron Mine have also been partially completed. Metallurgists, in combination with the characteristics of our country's resources, have launched research to establish our own alloy steel system, and have initially produced high-strength boron-molybdenum alloy structural steel and carburizing-grade boron steel; combined with the research on improving the quality of steel ingots, the distribution law of hydrogen in steel has been proposed; the oxygen blowing test of electric furnace carbon steel has been successful, improving productivity. In the petroleum industry, scientists have evaluated and identified the crude oil from Karamay, Yanchang, Yongping, Yumen, and other places, and proposed a scientific basis for crude oil processing. The research results on the aromatic hydrocarbons in natural petroleum and synthetic petroleum are of considerable significance for the establishment of our country's new petroleum refining industry. In coordination with the production of antibiotics, microbiologists, medicinal chemists, and organic chemists have respectively launched research on the collection and selection of new antibiotics, the chemical structure of chlortetracycline and streptomycin, the metabolic physiology of chlortetracycline bacteria, and improved the synthesis method of chloramphenicol. These works of scientists directly support the country's industrial production and basic construction.

In coordination with agriculture, forestry, and health, the research work done by scientists on the prediction and control of cotton aphids and locusts, the prevention and control of potato late blight, self-generating nitrogen-fixing bacteria and phosphate bacteria fertilizers, the breeding of castor silkworms, the prevention and control of shipworms, the preservation of railway sleepers, and the mildew prevention of electrical insulators all have practical value.

Scientists have also organized a large force to conduct surveys and research on the natural resources and natural conditions of the motherland. They have conducted investigations and research on the natural zoning of China, comprehensively sorted out the historical data of earthquakes in China, proposed a plan for the regional division of earthquakes in China, and vigorously launched research on the regional geology of the Qilian Mountains and the petroleum geology of the Qaidam Basin. The soil and water conservation in the middle reaches of the Yellow River and the soil survey in the lower reaches of the Yellow River may be completed within this year. The soil survey in the Yangtze River basin and the comprehensive exploration of Heilongjiang and Xinjiang have already begun. The investigation and research on tropical and subtropical biological resources have also achieved some results.

Philosophers and social scientists have conducted meaningful research and discussions on important issues such as the struggle between idealism and materialism in the history of Chinese philosophy, the acceptance of Chinese philosophical heritage, the nature of the current contradictions between the working class and the bourgeoisie in our country, the basic economic laws of the transition period, the contradiction between the superstructure and the base, and commodity production and the law of value. They have also started systematic data collection work, and in coordination with relevant departments, have conducted investigations and research on the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, agricultural production cooperatives, individual handicrafts, and handicraft production cooperatives, and compiled investigation reports and data. Materials on the history of modern Chinese industry, the history of modern agriculture, and the history of handicrafts have been successively compiled. In order to realize the standardization of modern Chinese, linguists have extensively launched investigations and research on Chinese phonetics, grammar, vocabulary, rhetoric, dialects, and the history of Chinese. They have also conducted large-scale investigations and research on the languages of ethnic minorities, helped ethnic minorities formulate or revise writing systems, and completed twenty writing schemes for sixteen ethnic minorities. Archaeological workers have carried out excavations of ancient cities and tombs in the ancient cultural centers of Xi'an and Luoyang; conducted archaeological surveys in the Sanmenxia and Liujiaxia areas, and discovered more than 400 ancient cultural sites; and systematically sorted out the materials on oracle bone inscriptions and bronzes.
