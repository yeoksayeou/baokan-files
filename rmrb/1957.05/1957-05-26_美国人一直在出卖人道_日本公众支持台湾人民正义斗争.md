Xinhua News Agency, May 25th dispatch from Tokyo: Japanese newspapers and people from all walks of life sympathize with and support the anti-American struggle of the people in Taipei.

    "Asahi Shimbun" published an editorial saying that the U.S. Army deliberately offended public anger, causing the demonstrations in Taipei. The United States should take it as a "good lesson."

    "Yomiuri Shimbun" said: "Americans have been betraying humanity. Americans seem to have two kinds of humanity, one for their own people and the other for foreigners." The newspaper said: "A U.S. military court declared an American soldier who killed a Chinese person not guilty. Then, if Girard were handed over to the Americans for trial, he might also receive the same lenient judgment." It said that not only the public, but even the Chiang Kai-shek group were dissatisfied with the acquittal of Reynolds, the murderer who killed Liu Ziran.

    "Tokyo Shimbun" pointed out that Americans must calmly think about why the people of Taipei are standing on the side of the victim's wife. It said: "The United States should abide by the obligations it has already undertaken to Japan in the Girard case. It is unwise to anger the Japanese because of this kind of incident."

    U.S. soldier Girard shot and killed a Japanese woman for no reason in January of this year. The Japan-U.S. Joint Committee decided on May 16th that Japan would try the criminal. However, U.S. Secretary of Defense Wilson ordered the U.S. military authorities the next day not to hand Girard over to Japan.

    A Japanese government spokesman said today that he hopes the U.S. Department of Defense can learn a lesson from the demonstrations in Taipei when estimating Japanese nationalism. They pointed out that the Girard case contains more factors that would anger Japanese public opinion than the Reynolds case. These government officials also pointed out that the Girard case was a deliberate murder case. If the United States slightly offends the Japanese public, the Taipei demonstrations may spread to Japan.

    美国人一直在出卖人道
    日本公众支持台湾人民正义斗争
    新华社25日讯　东京消息：日本报纸和各界人士同情和支持台北人民的反美斗争。
      “朝日新闻”发表社论说，美国陆军是故意触犯众怒，引起了台北的示威。美国应该把它作为一个“很好的教训”。
      “读卖新闻”说：“美国人一直在出卖人道。美国人似乎有两种人道，一种对待本国人，另一种是对待外国人的。”这家报纸说：“美国军事法庭宣告打死一个中国人的一名美国兵无罪。那末，如果把哲腊德交由美国人审判，他也可能得到同样宽大的判决。”它说，对于宣判杀死刘自然的凶手雷诺无罪，不仅是公众，就连蒋介石集团也感到不满。
      “东京新闻”指出，美国人必须冷静地想一想，为什么台北人民都站在被害者妻子方面。它说：“美国应该遵守在哲腊德案件方面已经向日本承担了的义务。因为这种事件而激怒日本人是不明智的”。
    美国兵哲腊德在今年一月无故枪杀了一个日本妇女。日美联合委员会曾经在5月16日决定由日本审判这个罪犯。但美国国防部长威尔逊却在第二天命令美军当局不把哲腊德交给日本。
    日本政府发言人今天表示，希望美国国防部在估计日本民族主义的时候，能从台北发生的示威中吸取教训。他们指出，哲腊德案件比雷诺案件包含着更多的会激怒日本舆论的因素。这些政府官员们并且指出，哲腊德案件是蓄意谋害案件。美国稍一触怒日本公众，台北的示威就可能波及日本。
