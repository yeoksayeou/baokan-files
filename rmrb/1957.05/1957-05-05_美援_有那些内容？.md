    What does "U.S. Aid" include?
    Recently, some readers have requested that we explain the term "U.S. Aid." Here is a brief explanation:
    U.S. Aid is an important tool used by the U.S. government after the war to realize its aggressive foreign policy and goes hand in hand with its "policy of strength." The initial application of U.S. Aid was the so-called "Truman Doctrine," which helped the reactionary governments of Greece and Turkey suppress democratic movements, while also extending American influence into these two countries. From 1948, the U.S. government implemented the Marshall Plan to export surplus goods to Europe. This plan helped the United States establish control over Western European countries, pulling them onto the American "Cold War" track. In 1950, the Point Four Program was implemented with the aim of carrying out economic aggression against underdeveloped regions. During the Korean War, in order to accelerate the implementation of global expansion and war preparation policies, the United States passed the "Mutual Security Act" in October 1951, merging several foreign aid bills into the "Mutual Security Program," becoming a single program to support American military aggression.
    The aid projects stipulated in the "Mutual Security Act" mainly include the following:
    1. Military Aid
    This is a type of aid that simply supplies weapons, military materials, and labor services. The recipient countries are all countries or regions that have military agreements with the United States, such as NATO countries, SEATO countries, Iran, Pakistan, etc. The Chiang Kai-shek Group in Taiwan, the Syngman Rhee Group in South Korea, and the Ngo Dinh Diem Group in South Vietnam are the main targets of this type of aid, the purpose of which is to drive these reactionary groups to continue to be enemies with the liberated people of their own countries and maintain a situation that is conducive to American expansion.
    Since the implementation of the "Mutual Security Act," military aid has accounted for the majority of U.S. foreign aid. The U.S. military aid appropriation for the 1957 fiscal year was two billion U.S. dollars, accounting for more than half of the total foreign aid appropriation of 3.8 billion U.S. dollars for that year. For the 1958 fiscal year, President Eisenhower requested a foreign aid appropriation of 4.4 billion U.S. dollars, of which 2.5 billion U.S. dollars belonged to military aid.
    Countries that accept military aid must use far more funds than the "aid" they receive to expand their military and act as a link in the U.S. global war preparation system.
    2. Economic Aid
    Including the following four types:
    (1) Defense Support: This is a type of aid that provides non-military materials and labor services to countries that have military agreements with the United States. This aid must be used in areas related to "defense," so it is actually a form of indirect military aid. The appropriation for defense support this fiscal year is 1.16 billion U.S. dollars, accounting for nearly two-thirds of the total economic aid appropriation. This item, combined with direct military aid, accounts for nine-tenths of the total foreign aid.
    (2) Technical Assistance: This is a type of aid that the U.S. government provides to certain countries through bilateral agreements, the United Nations, or the Organization of American States, including educators, technicians, and public health experts, etc. The purpose of this aid is to pave the way for later infiltration. The amount of money used for this aid this fiscal year is 150 million U.S. dollars.
    (3) Development Assistance: This is a type of aid that aims to gradually achieve control over underdeveloped countries through the medium of helping them develop. Currently, this aid is about 250 million U.S. dollars per year. The above two types of aid are very limited in amount.
    (4) President's Special Fund: This is a fund of 100 million U.S. dollars that is given to the U.S. President for special purposes. Eisenhower once used this fund to carry out destructive activities against socialist countries.
    In addition, there is a permanent fund specifically used to carry out subversive activities against socialist countries. The amount first approved by Congress in the 1951 fiscal year was 100 million U.S. dollars. It has been gradually increased since then.
    The United States attaches many conditions when implementing foreign aid and crudely interferes in the domestic and foreign affairs of recipient countries, causing dissatisfaction in many countries. Therefore, the U.S. State Department is changing to adopt some more roundabout methods and is expanding the scope of aid from followers of the U.S. Cold War policy to peaceful and neutral countries. Earlier this month, Dulles, at a special committee of the Senate studying foreign aid, requested a change in the current method of discussing appropriations annually, and instead implement a long-term plan with 750 million U.S. dollars per year as an economic development fund for Asia and Africa. This new trend in U.S. foreign aid policy shows that the United States is preparing to implement a "long-term strategy" in the Asia-Africa region, attempting to lure neutral countries into the net.

### “美援”有那些内容？

    “美援”有那些内容？
    最近有些读者要求我们对“美援”这个字眼作一些说明，现简答如下：
    美援是战后美国政府用以实现它的侵略外交政策的一个重要手段，是同它的“实力政策”相辅而行的。美援的最初运用就是所谓“杜鲁门主义”，帮助希腊和土耳其反动政府镇压了民主运动，同时也就把美国的势力伸进了这两个国家。从1948年起，美国政府实行了向欧洲输出剩余物资的马歇尔计划。这个计划帮助了美国建立对西欧国家的控制，把它们拉上美国“冷战”的轨道。1950年又实行了目的是对落后地区进行经济侵略的第四点计划。在侵略朝鲜战争期间，美国为了加紧推行全球性扩张和备战政策，在1951年10月通过“共同安全法”，把几种援外法案都并入“共同安全计划”，成为一个支持美国军事侵略的单一计划。
    “共同安全法”规定的援助项目主要包括以下几种：
    一、军事援助
    这是单纯供应武器、军用物资和劳务的一种援助。受援国都是同美国订有军事协定的国家或地区，像北大西洋集团国家、东南亚条约组织国家、伊朗、巴基斯坦等等。台湾蒋介石集团、南朝鲜李承晚集团和南越吴庭艳集团是这种援助的主要对象，目的是驱使这些反动集团，继续同他们本国解放了的人民为敌，维持一种有利于美国进行扩张的形势。
    自从实施“共同安全法”以来，军事援助在美国对外援助中占了主要部分。1957财政年度美国军事援助拨款是二十亿美元，占该年援外拨款总额三十八亿美元的一半以上。1958财政年度艾森豪威尔总统要求的援外拨款额是四十四亿美元，其中有二十五亿美元属于军事援助。
    接受军事援助的国家，必须用比所接受的“援助”大得多的资金来扩充军备，充当美国全球备战体系中的一个环节。
    二、经济援助
    包括以下四种：
    （1）防御支持：这是向同美国订有军事协定的国家提供非军事物资和劳务的一种援助。这种援助必须用在同“防务”有关的方面，因此实际上是一种间接的军事援助。防御支持拨款在本财政年度是十一亿六千万美元，几占经济援助拨款总额的三分之二。这一项和直接军事援助合计，占全部援外数目的十分之九。
    （2）技术援助：这是美国政府通过双边协定、联合国组织或美洲国家组织向某些国家提供教育工作者、技术人员和公共卫生专家等等的一种援助。这种援助的目的是为后来的渗入开辟道路。本财政年度用于此项援助的款额是一亿五千万美元。
    （3）开发援助：这是以帮助不发达国家进行开发为媒介而逐步达到控制这些国家的目的的一种援助。目前这项援助每年约为二亿五千万美元。以上两项援助数目都非常有限。
    （4）总统特别基金：这是交给美国总统支配，供特殊用途的一笔一亿美元的基金。艾森豪威尔曾经动用这笔基金对社会主义国家进行破坏性的活动。
    此外还有一笔专门用于对社会主义国家进行颠覆活动的常设基金。1951财政年度国会第一次通过的数目是一亿美元。以后又陆续有所增加。
    美国在实行对外援助时，附有很多条件，并对受援国的内政外交进行粗暴的干涉，引起许多国家的不满。因此美国国务院正在改行采取一些比较迂回的办法，并把援助范围从美国冷战政策追随者扩大到和平中立国家。本月初，杜勒斯在参院的一个研究外援特别委员会上要求改变目前逐年讨论拨款的办法，而实行一项每年以七亿五千万美元作为亚洲和非洲经济发展基金的长期计划。美国外援政策上的这种新动向，说明美国准备在亚非地区推行一种“放长线、钓大鱼”的办法，企图使中立国家上钩。（振亚）
