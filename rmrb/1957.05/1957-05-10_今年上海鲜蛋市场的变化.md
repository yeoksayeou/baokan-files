    Changes in Shanghai's Fresh Egg Market This Year
    In Shanghai, the months of March and April in the lunar calendar have historically been the peak season for fresh egg supply. However, this year the situation is different. The average daily supply of fresh eggs to state-owned companies and free markets is only about 140,000 jin. Last year at this time, the Municipal Food Company alone procured more than 200,000 jin of fresh eggs to Shanghai every day.
    Due to the limited supply, the price of fresh eggs in the Shanghai market has not fallen. The current retail price of eggs at state-owned companies is 6 jiao per jin. The egg prices in the free markets are similar. Last year, within a month and five days, from March 5th to April 10th, the state-owned companies adjusted the egg price four times in a row, reaching the lowest level on April 10th, with a retail price of 5 jiao and 2 fen per jin.
    According to recent inquiries made by relevant state-owned commercial departments in Shanghai to the producing areas, the main reason for the reduced supply of fresh eggs this year is that the weather has remained cold since the beginning of spring, resulting in fewer eggs laid by hens.
    Personnel from the Shanghai commercial departments also analyze that even during the peak season for fresh egg supply this year, prices will not fall too much. On the one hand, local storage has been widely implemented in the producing areas this year. At the same time, after the opening of free markets, the number of chickens raised by farmers has increased, and there are also more hatcheries in the producing areas. The Yangzhou area of Jiangsu Province alone will retain 2 million jin of seed eggs this year. On the other hand, Shanghai has also prepared a large number of egg storage jars and some cold storage warehouses in advance, and has begun to process salted eggs and frozen eggs in large quantities. Therefore, the phenomenon of excessive fresh egg supply and sharp price drops as happened last year will not occur.

### 今年上海鲜蛋市场的变化

    今年上海鲜蛋市场的变化
    在上海，历年农历3、4月份是鲜蛋上市量最多的季节。但是今年出现了不同的情况，国营公司和自由市场的鲜蛋到货量，平均每天只有十四万斤左右。而去年这时候，仅市食品公司采购的鲜蛋，每天就有二十多万斤运到上海。
    由于到货不多，上海市场上鲜蛋的价格没有跌下来，现在国营公司的鸡蛋零售牌价是每斤六角。自由市场的蛋价也相仿。而去年在3月5日到4月10日的一个月零五天内，国营公司的鸡蛋牌价一连调整了四次，到4月10日已达到最低水平，每斤零售价格是五角二分。
    据上海有关国营商业部门最近向产区了解，今年鲜蛋来货减少的主要原因是入春以来，气候仍然较冷，母鸡产蛋少。
    上海商业部门的人员还分析，今年即使在鲜蛋上市最旺的季节，价格也不会下降太多。一方面今年产区普遍实行了就地储藏，同时开放自由市场后，农民养鸡数量增加，产区孵房也有增多，仅江苏扬州专区今年就将留种蛋二百万斤。另方面，上海也提前准备了大批储蛋缸和一些冷风仓库，并已开始大量加工咸蛋和冰蛋。因此不会发生像去年那样鲜蛋上市数量过多，价格急骤下跌的现象。
