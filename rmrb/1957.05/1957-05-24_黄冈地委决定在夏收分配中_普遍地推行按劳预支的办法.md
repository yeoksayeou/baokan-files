According to a report in the Hubei Daily: The Huanggang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Hubei Province, at its joint conference of county party secretaries held from the 2nd to the 8th of this month, decided to universally implement the method of advance payment based on labor in this year's summer harvest distribution, to replace the previous method of advance distribution for the summer harvest.

The meeting held that agricultural cooperatives have gained experience in implementing the policy of remuneration based on labor over the past year, and contracting work and output to the group has basically gotten on track. In addition, the previous financial disclosure and clearing of accounts have created favorable conditions for the widespread promotion of the advance payment system based on labor this year. The fundamental requirement of the masses for summer harvest distribution is simplicity and rationality. For example, in the summer harvest distribution last year, Qinlao No. 1 Cooperative in Dadu Township, Xinzhou County, had to divide everything at once, but due to inaccurate yield estimation, the plan was changed four times, and in the end, it all fell apart. Because many members' reported work points were not realized, it resulted in a large amount of overspending. Therefore, the members urgently demanded a simple and reasonable method this year. Pilot experiences have also proven that replacing the previous method of advance distribution for the summer harvest with advance payment based on labor can achieve this goal.

The basic approach this year is: two advance payments, one settlement. First, cooperatives that have not done a good job in financial affairs should continue to clear their finances and disclose their finances. Second, yield estimation should not be too high, learning from the lesson of "biting off more than one can chew" last year. Third, check the contracting of work and output to the group, clear work points, and adjust the phenomenon of being too lenient or too strict. Finally, on this basis, draw up a general plan with a clear understanding. In the advance payment, the relationship between the three (state, collective, individual) must still be properly resolved, and generally, sufficient production funds should be reserved. All of this must be democratically discussed and decided by the members' representative meeting.

The meeting held that correctly implementing the principle of remuneration based on labor is essentially consistent with implementing the class line. Therefore, it is necessary to oppose egalitarianism—taking care of all households in difficulty—and also to oppose failing to help genuine households in difficulty solve their problems. It is necessary to understand the situation clearly and take measures such as arranging labor, developing household sideline production, credit cooperative loans, or mutual borrowing to solve the problems of households in difficulty. Special households in difficulty should be subsidized by the public welfare fund. Overspending households from last year will not be included in this year's accounts and will be repaid by each household in installments. In principle, overspending this year should be repaid in full, and the cooperative (or grain store) should handle the food grain through a revolving method.

    黄冈地委决定在夏收分配中
    普遍地推行按劳预支的办法
    本报讯　据湖北日报报道：中共湖北省黄冈地委在本月2日至8日召开的县委书记联席会议，决定在今年夏收分配中，普遍推行按劳预支的办法，以代替过去夏收预分的办法。
    会议认为，一年来农业社执行按劳取酬政策，都有了经验，包工包产基本上了路，加上前段财政公开，清理了账目，都为今年普遍推广按劳预支制度创造了有利条件。当前群众对夏收分配的根本要求是简单、合理。如新洲县大渡乡勤劳一社在去年夏收分配中，因为要一次分断，却由于估产不准，变动了四次方案，最后一风吹了。由于许多社员预报工分未实现，以致造成了大量超支。因此，社员们在今年迫切要求换简单合理的办法。试点的经验也证明，用按劳预支代替过去的夏收预分办法是可以达到这个目的的。
    今年的基本作法是：两次预支，一次结算。首先财务没搞好的社，继续清理财务，公开财政；第二，估产不要偏高，接受去年“打肿脸充胖子”的教训；第三，检查包工包产，清理工分，调整偏松偏紧的现象；最后，在此基础上订个大体方案，心中有底。预支中仍然必须解决好三者关系，一般应留足生产资金。这一切都必须通过社员代表会民主讨论决定。
    会议认为，正确地执行按劳取酬原则，实质上是和贯彻阶级政策一致的。因此，必须反对平均主义思想——把一切困难户都包下来，又要反对不帮助真正的困难户解决问题。必须摸清底子，采取安排劳动、发展家庭副业、信用社贷款或互借等办法解决困难户问题，特殊困难户由公益金补助。对去年的超支户，不算在今年账内，由各户自报分期偿还；今年的超支原则上应还清，口粮采取由社（或粮店）周转办法处理。
