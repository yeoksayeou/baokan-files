Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 10th: U.S. President Eisenhower's special envoy Richards, who returned to Washington on the 8th, said in a radio address on the evening of the 9th that he had visited fifteen countries during his trip to the Middle East. To those countries that, in his view, "particularly needed assistance" to strengthen their military forces, he had promised to provide "certain military aid, such as guns, tanks, and things of that nature." In addition, he had also promised "certain economic aid" to some countries.

Richards did not name the countries that accepted this "aid" or the total amount of "aid." However, Washington officials said the total was approximately $115 million.

Richards said that among the governments he had visited, there was "some disappointment" with the amount of "aid" he was able to promise.

Richards said that he did not visit three countries: one because it did not issue him a firm invitation, the second because its government did not demonstrate "genuine sincerity in conducting frank and sincere discussions," and the third because providing U.S. "aid" in other ways would be "better." It is said that the first two were Syria and Egypt, and the third refers to Jordan.

The "Christian Science Monitor," in commenting on the results of Richards' trip to the Middle East, pointed out that "he was far from completely successful in persuading Middle Eastern countries to believe that the Eisenhower Doctrine is the best thing for them. Egypt, Syria, and Jordan did not even invite the President's special envoy to their capitals; and in the countries where he was invited, he did not receive a truly warm welcome. For example, Yemen and Afghanistan were both clearly unwilling to sign communiques identifying international communism as the enemy."

    艾森豪威尔主义滞销
    理查兹回美后声调低沉
    新华社10日讯华盛顿消息：在8日回到华盛顿的美国总统特使理查兹9日晚上发表广播演说时说，他这次中东之行访问了十五个国家，对于那些在他看来“特别需要援助”来加强它们的军事力量的国家，他已经答应给予“某些军事援助，如枪炮、坦克和诸如此类的东西”。此外，他对一些国家也已经答应给予“某些经济援助”。
    理查兹没有说出接受这些“援助”的国家的名字和“援助”的总数。但是华盛顿官员说，总数大约是一亿一千五百万美元。
    理查兹说，在他所访问过的那些政府中间，对于他所能答应下来的“援助”数额“有某种失望情绪”。
    理查兹说，他没有访问三个国家：一个国家是因为没有向他发出坚决的邀请，第二个国家是因为它的政府没有表现出“进行坦率和诚恳商谈的真正诚意”，第三个国家是因为用其他的方式来提供美国的“援助”要“好一些”。据说，前两个是叙利亚、埃及，第三个是指约旦。
   “基督教科学箴言报”在评论理查兹中东之行的结果时指出，“在说服中东国家，使它们相信艾森豪威尔主义对它们是最好的东西这一点上，他远没有得到完全的成功。埃及、叙利亚和约旦甚至没有邀请这位总统特使到它们的首都去；而在他接到邀请的国家里，他并没有真正受到热烈的欢迎。例如也门和阿富汗都明显地不愿意在指明国际共产主义为敌人的公报上签字。”
