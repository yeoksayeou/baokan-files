The Party Committee of the Central Direct Organs held an enlarged meeting yesterday afternoon. The heads of Party organizations of various ministries, commissions, and bureaus first reported on the progress of the rectification movement in their respective units. Most units have already discussed or formulated specific plans for the rectification movement within their units, and some units are in the process of discussing them. Some units have established leading groups, with the heads of the units serving as the leaders of the leading groups, and the heads of Party organizations participating in the leading groups. Some ministries have also established separate leading groups based on the actual situation of their respective branches. Some units have discussed the issue of leading cadres of the organs participating in physical labor.

The meeting suggested that ministries, commissions, and bureaus should formulate specific plans for the rectification movement as soon as possible, based on the actual conditions of their respective units. The general steps can be: first, on the basis of studying Chairman Mao's two reports, allocate a period of time to study the Central Committee's instructions on the rectification movement and the relevant editorials in the People's Daily, in order to correctly understand and grasp the spirit of the instructions and smoothly carry out the rectification movement.

The meeting discussed the key points and methods of the rectification movement as instructed by the Central Committee. It was believed that the rectification movement should first focus on inspecting, summarizing, and improving the implementation of the correct handling of contradictions among the people, that is, focusing on inspecting, summarizing, and improving how the ministries, commissions, and bureaus implement the principles and policies related to the work of various departments as stipulated by the Party Central Committee. Therefore, each unit must, based on its specific circumstances, classify the various problems found, such as the implementation of policies and guidelines and internal contradictions within the organs, according to their priority and importance, and gradually study, solve, and improve them. Some problems, especially some minor problems in ideological style, if they have already been resolved or corrected, can be omitted to avoid getting bogged down in minor problems from the beginning, losing sight of the bigger picture, or delaying time by arguing about minor issues. The meeting considered it feasible to adopt various methods, boldly encourage criticism to eliminate concerns, and realistically analyze specific situations to focus on inspecting and solving major problems existing in the work.

The meeting analyzed unhealthy ideas in some new units that believed "there is no wind to rectify," and in individual units, some people mistakenly believed that the rectification was "exclusively for leading cadres."

The meeting finally decided that during the rectification movement, theoretical study in the organs would be temporarily suspended; the time for rectification study and inspection and summarization work would be tentatively set at two and a half days per week. The meeting hoped that at the Sixth (this newspaper mistakenly printed "Second") Congress of the Central Direct Organs to be held this month, responsible comrades from relevant ministries would attend the congress and report on the Party's various principles and policies.

    中央直属机关研究整风重点
    着重检查政策执行情况
    本报讯　中共中央直属机关委员会在昨日下午举行扩大会议，各部、委、局的党组织负责人首先汇报了各单位关于开展整风运动的情况。多数单位已经讨论或制订了本单位整风运动的具体计划，一部分单位正在进行讨论。有些单位已经成立了领导小组，单位负责人是领导小组的小组长，党组织负责人参加了领导小组。有些部还依据所属各支部的实际情况，又分别成立了领导小组。有些单位讨论了机关领导干部参加体力劳动的问题。
    会议建议各部、委、局根据各单位的实际情况，尽速制订整风运动的具体计划。大体的步骤，可以先在学习毛主席的两个报告的基础上，划出一段时间，学习中共中央关于整风运动的指示和人民日报有关的社论，以便正确理解和掌握指示的精神，顺利地开展整风运动。
    会议讨论了中共中央指示的整风重点和方法等问题。认为这次整风运动，首先应当着重检查、总结和改进贯彻正确处理人民内部矛盾问题，也就是着重检查、总结和改进各部、委、局如何贯彻执行党中央所规定的有关各部门工作的方针和政策。因此，各单位必须根据本单位的具体情况，将检查到的各类问题，如执行政策方针和机关内部矛盾等问题，分别主次轻重，逐步研究，逐步解决，逐步改进。有些问题、特别是思想作风上的一些次要问题，如果已经解决或改正，则可不再提出，以避免一开始就纠缠在次要问题上、因小失大，或因争论次要问题而拖延时间。会议认为，采取多种方式方法，放手鼓励批评，以消除顾虑，并且实事求是地分析具体情况，有重点地检查和解决工作中存在的重大问题，这种作法是可行的。
    会议对于个别新的单位有人认为“无风可整”，以及个别单位有人误认为“专整领导干部”等等不健康的思想作了分析。
    会议最后决定：在整风运动中暂时停止机关的理论学习；整风学习和检查总结工作的时间，暂定每周两个半天。会议希望在本月召开的中共中央直属机关第六次（2日本报误排为“第二次”）代表大会上，请有关各部的负责同志出席大会，分别报告党的各项方针政策。
