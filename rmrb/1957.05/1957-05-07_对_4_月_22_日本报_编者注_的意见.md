    Opinions on the "Editor's Note" of this newspaper on April 22nd
    Professor Yang Zhijiu from Nankai University sent a letter expressing disagreement with the note added by the newspaper's editor on April 22nd after Mr. Lei Haizong's speech. We are now publishing his opinions for everyone to discuss.  —Editor
   Editor,
    After reading Mr. Lei Haizong's speech and the editor's note on the third page of the People's Daily on April 22nd, I couldn't help but have many things to say. Although my theoretical and professional level is very shallow, I still want to muster the courage to write out my feelings and ask your newspaper for guidance.
    In the editor's note on the seventh page of the April 21st issue, you already expressed disagreement with Mr. Lei's views, which gave me the impression that Mr. Lei must have made a principle error. However, after reading Mr. Lei's speech and the editor's note on the 22nd, I felt that your newspaper's criticism of Mr. Lei was not the same as Mr. Lei's original intention.
    Mr. Lei said: "After 1895, Lenin and Stalin had new ideas on individual issues, but they mainly talked about current revolutionary issues. In terms of understanding and organizing the experience of thousands of years of human history and establishing new social sciences, they basically remained at the level of 1895." We should calmly think about these words. What it refers to is obviously not that Marxism did not develop at all after 1895. On the issue of revolution, Lenin, Stalin, the Chinese Communist Party, and Chairman Mao have all developed a lot, "these are all well-known," can we think that Mr. Lei does not know this? Since Mr. Lei knows these "well-known" facts, and still says that Marxism is still at the level of 1895, we should think that Mr. Lei must have something else in mind. In fact, in his short speech, Mr. Lei has already said that it is about world history. Mr. Lei is a historian, and it is not an exaggeration to say that there has been no development in historical science (especially ancient history) after 1895. Mr. Lei raised this point precisely to remind us to pay attention to mastering materials and using rich materials to supplement and develop the historical science pioneered by Marx and Engels, and not to think that Marx and Engels have thoroughly studied historical science, and that their principles and conclusions can replace the research of historical science. This is of positive significance for opposing dogmatism and advocating independent thinking and hard work. This is undoubtedly more beneficial advice than simply applying the individual principles and conclusions of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin to Chinese history (there are many examples of this). Mr. Lei's letter on the 28th explained this more clearly, but we can also see it from his speech on the 22nd.
    Of course, Mr. Lei's speech may make people think that the stagnation of historical science after 1895 is the stagnation of Marxism, which has the fault of "generalizing from one instance." This is certainly not Mr. Lei's intention, and we should not "misinterpret the meaning because of the words." Assuming it is really generalizing from one instance, then of course it should be discussed and criticized. But that is definitely not the focus of Mr. Lei's talk. We should affirm his main points.
    Perhaps I do not have a sufficient understanding of the spiritual essence of the "Editor's Note," so I cannot agree with the editor's words. It should be admitted that under the leadership of the Party, after several years of study, the general public has a preliminary understanding of Marxism, and will not be negatively affected by someone saying that Marxism has not developed; although the understanding of the development of Marxism is not deep, there is still general common sense. In this case, I cannot understand the meaning of the editor's note even more. So all these words of mine may be misunderstandings, and I hope to be corrected.

    对4月22日本报“编者注”的意见
    南开大学教授杨志玖先生来信，对本报编者4月22日在雷海宗先生发言后面所加的注表示不同意。我们现在把他的意见发表出来供大家讨论。　——编者
   编辑同志：
    读了4月22日人民日报第三版雷海宗先生的发言和编者注，我不禁有许多话要说。虽然我的理论和业务水平都很浅薄，我仍要鼓起勇气来写出我的感想，向贵报请教。
    在4月21日第七版的编者按下，你们已提出对雷先生的看法不能同意，这就给我一个印象：雷先生一定犯了原则性的错误了。但看了22日雷先生的发言和编者注，觉得贵报对雷先生的批评和雷先生的原意并不相同。
    雷先生说：“1895年以后，列宁斯大林在个别问题上有新的提法，但他们主要谈当前革命问题。从了解整理几千年来人类历史经验，建立新的社会科学来说，基本上停留在1895年。”这几句话我们要平心静气的想一下，它所指的显然不是说1895年以后马克思主义没有任何发展。在关于革命问题上，列宁、斯大林、中国共产党和毛主席都发展了很多，“这些都是人所共知的”，我们能想到雷先生不知道吗？既然雷先生知道这些“人所共知”的事实，而仍说马克思主义还停留在1895年，我们应该想到：雷先生一定是另有所指。事实上，在简短的发言里，雷先生已说出是关于世界史方面的问题。雷先生是学历史的，在历史科学方面（特别是古代史方面）说1895年以后没有什么发展并不是过甚其辞。雷先生提出这点来，正是要我们注意掌握资料，用丰富的资料来补充发展马恩所创始的历史科学，而不要以为马克思、恩格斯已经把历史科学研究透了，用他们的原理和结论就可以代替历史科学的研究。这对于反对教条主义，提倡独立思考和刻苦钻研方面，是有积极意义的。这比起硬把马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的个别原理和结论来套在中国历史上的作法（这种例证是很多的）无疑是更有益的诤言。28日雷先生的来信中对这点说的更清楚些，但我们从22日的发言里也可以看出。
    当然，雷先生的发言，也许使人觉得1895年后历史科学的停止发展就是马克思主义的停止发展，有
  “以一概全”的毛病。这当然不是雷先生的本意，我们不应“以辞害意”。假定真是以一概全，那当然应该讨论和批评。但那决不是雷先生谈话的重点。我们应该肯定他的主要的地方。
    也许我对于“编者注”的精神实质体会不够，所以我对于编者的话不能同意。应该承认，在党的领导下，经过几年来的学习，一般人对马克思主义已有初步认识，不会因为有人说马克思主义没有发展而受到什么坏的影响；对于马克思主义的发展情况，理解虽不深刻，但一般常识还是有的。这一来，我更不能体会编者注的意思了。所以我这些话可能全是误解，希望得到指正。
