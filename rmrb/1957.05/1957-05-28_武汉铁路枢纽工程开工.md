Wuhan Railway Hub Project Begins Construction

    (Our dispatch) The Wuhan Railway Hub Project began construction in mid-May.

    This project is being constructed to connect the Beijing-Hankou, Guangdong-Hankou, and Wuhan-Daye Railways after the completion of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge. The project will involve the construction of more than thirty bridges and culverts, the reconstruction and new construction of fourteen stations, and dedicated lines connecting factories and mines in the Wuhan area. It is expected that after the completion of the Yangtze River Bridge in October of this year, passenger trains traveling north and south will be able to pass over the Yangtze River via the newly built lines. The railway hub project is expected to be completed in May of next year. (Geng Weihai)
