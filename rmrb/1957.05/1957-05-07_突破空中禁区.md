    Breaking Through the Aerial Forbidden Zone
    More than a dozen Soviet experts and Chinese railway surveyors, who are selecting the route for the Qinghai-Tibet Railway, have already experienced 400 flying hours over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, which has always been designated as an "aerial forbidden zone"; and they risked their lives to take photos of the terrain of tens of thousands of square kilometers of the route. Now, survey and design personnel can sit indoors and select an ideal route that is both convenient and relatively simple to construct from the terrain photos that have been taken.
    The climate on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is unpredictable. In the area around the Tanggula Mountains, the peaks are rugged and precipitous, rising more than 6,000 meters above sea level. The convection of warm and cold air from the north and south often stirs up high-speed winds with speeds of up to 20 to 30 meters per second. The aircraft is shaken and unstable by the impact of this turbulent acute airflow. Sometimes the fuselage suddenly drops three or four hundred meters, and then rises six or seven hundred meters. Not long ago, Chinese aviation personnel opened up this route with unparalleled courage and resourcefulness; now, surveying personnel from both the Soviet Union and China are crisscrossing several routes here to carry out aerial photography and radio altimetry.

    突破空中禁区
    正在为青藏铁路选线的十几位苏联专家和中国的铁路勘测人员，已经在一向被划作“空中禁区”的青藏高原上空经历了四百个飞行小时；并且冒着生命危险，拍摄了几万平方公里线路地形的照片。现在，勘测设计人员就可以坐在室内从已经摄得的地形照片上，选择一条既便捷、施工又比较简单的理想线路。
    青藏高原气候变化无常。在唐古拉山区的周围，峰峦嶙峭，拔海六千多公尺。南北暖冷空气的对流，时常在这里激起一股股每秒速率高达二、三十公尺的高速风。飞机被这种汹涌的急性气流冲击得摇摆不定，有时机身突然会下降三、四百公尺，接着又上升六、七百公尺。不久前我国航空人员以无比的英勇和机智开辟了这条航线；现在苏中两国的航测人员又在这里来回地穿出好几条航线，进行空中摄影和无线电测高。
