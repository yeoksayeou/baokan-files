　　Leaving School, Heading to the Farm
　　Soviet Middle School Graduates Participate in Agricultural Labor

　　(Our report) Moscow, May 13th—A class of tenth-grade students from Chita City's No. 24 Middle School in the Soviet Union recently decided to work on state farms or collective farms after graduation. The Communist Youth League organization supported their patriotic initiative and helped them choose their future work locations. The students have now accepted an invitation from a state farm named "Pre-Argun" located east of Lake Baikal and decided to work on this farm after receiving their graduation certificates. This farm, newly established three years ago in the wilderness, urgently needs the knowledge and strength of young people. The farm director personally visited the school to introduce the farm's situation to the students.

    离开学堂　走向农场
    苏联一班中学毕业生参加农业劳动
    本报讯　苏联赤塔市第二十四中学十年级学生，最近决定在毕业后全体到国营农场或集体农庄去工作。共青团的组织支持了他们这个爱国的倡议，并帮助他们选择了未来的工作地点。现在，学生们已经接受了贝加尔湖以东一个名叫“普列阿尔贡”国营农场的邀请，决定在接到毕业证书后就到这个农场去工作。这是三年前在荒原上新建立起来的一个农场，非常需要青年们的知识和力量，农场场长曾亲自到学校来向学生们介绍了这个农场的情况。
