Listen to the Opinions and Demands of Youth League Cadres Regarding the Leadership of Party Committees
    This Newspaper Invites Some Delegates Attending the Third National Congress of the Youth League to Discuss Issues Concerning Party-League Relations

    (Our Dispatch) The editorial department of this newspaper invited some delegates attending the Third National Congress of the Youth League to a symposium on Party-League relations on May 14th.

    Twenty-two responsible cadres of the League from provincial, regional, and county levels attended the meeting. Many delegates believed that the achievements of Party committees at all levels in leading the work of the Youth League in recent years have been fundamental. However, they also pointed out that Party committees at all levels still have many shortcomings in leading the work of the Youth League, and these shortcomings are mainly reflected in the following aspects.

    Does the Party Committee Care About This “Assistant”?

    This is a question raised by the delegates to some Party committees. Many delegates said that many county-level Party committees do not understand the nature, tasks, and role of the Youth League, do not understand the characteristics of youth work, and even do not care about the work of the Youth League at all. The delegate from Shandong Province said that in their area, many Party county committees have not discussed the work of the League for a long time. For example, after the central government issued instructions on strengthening the work of the Youth League in October 1953, many county committees did not study or implement them. After the provincial congress of the Youth League, the provincial Party committee approved and forwarded the report of this congress, but out of the fifteen counties in the Laiyang area, only four county Party committees discussed this report, and the other counties did not. Now, most of the secretaries of the League county committees are not members of the Party county committees, and they are not allowed to attend meetings of the Party county committees, making it difficult for them to understand the intentions of the Party committee in a timely manner, and it is also difficult to arrange their work according to the intentions of the Party committee. The delegate from Zhejiang said that the county Party committees not only do not consider the characteristics of the Youth League but even restrict the independent activities of the Youth League in many ways. For example, when streamlining meetings, they first streamline the meetings of the Youth League, regardless of whether they should be held or not. If the Party committee does not approve them, they cannot be held. There is a strange phenomenon in some areas: Party members who actively do League work are not encouraged by the Party organization but are often criticized by the Party organization. The League county committee of Lecheng County in Guangdong Province is more proactive in its work, and the county Party committee said that they were "acting smart." A probationary Party member in the Huzhou Silk Factory in Zhejiang Province serves as the secretary of a League branch. Once, the secretary of the Party branch said to him: "Your work is very good, but you care too much about the work of the League!" This probationary Party member was later worried about whether he would not be able to become a full member because he did too much League work. The delegate from Shanghai said that in some enterprises in Shanghai, some comrades who are enthusiastic about League work are often labeled with hats such as "seeking independence," "departmentalism," and "vanguardism."

    A few responsible Party cadres even believe that the Youth League organization is dispensable. The secretary of the CCP Jia County Committee in Henan Province said to the secretary of the League county committee in person: "The Youth League can exist or not."

    “Called Upon When Needed, Dismissed When No Longer Needed”

    The delegates used these two sentences to summarize the leadership style of some Party committees towards the Youth League. This leadership style is inseparable from the above-mentioned misunderstandings of the Youth League. Many delegates said that there are not many cases where the Youth League is completely unnecessary. The general situation is that they are only used, not educated; only criticized, not helped. They grab you when they need you, and leave you aside when they don't. League cadres in rural areas and cooperatives feel very distressed, and they compare themselves to "short-term workers" without regular work. The delegate from Zhejiang estimated that about 70% to 80% of the League cadres in rural areas and cooperatives are not at ease with their work. There are various reasons for the emergence of this kind of thinking, and the fact that the work of the League does not receive the attention, support, and help of the Party organization is also one of the important reasons. Many delegates said that in rural areas and cooperatives, the work of the Youth League is always considered last.

    The Party committee's excessive criticism and accusations of the work of the Youth League also affect the work enthusiasm of the League cadres. Some delegates said that in the past, the Party committee attached great importance to young people and saw many advantages of young people, but now some things have changed. Some responsible cadres of the Party committee like to pick on young people's faults and believe that young people have many shortcomings and are difficult to manage without analysis. Therefore, they do not trust or support the activities of young people. The delegate from Shandong cited an example: Last autumn, Haiyang County was preparing to carry out the work of storing green fodder. The county Party committee initially agreed, saying that each cooperative could build a cellar to store fodder, but then said that it was enough for each township to have one; finally, it was completely overturned, saying that it would not be done at all, and even the stored fodder was dug up. What was the reason? It was that they did not believe that the Youth League members could do a good job in storing green fodder. In fact, the Laiyang area stored more than 30 million jin of corn stalks last year, and only more than 20,000 jin were damaged. The views on youth agricultural production teams are also somewhat one-sided, criticizing only the shortcomings and not seeing the achievements. Last year, the Youth League of Jia County, Henan Province, wanted to carry out the work of corn pollination, but the Party county committee opposed it and criticized the Youth League for "seeking independence."

    “Dismantling the Machine and Using the Parts”

    Grasping League cadres but not League organizations; arbitrarily transferring League cadres and assigning League cadres to do other work. This situation has been more serious and common since last autumn. Some delegates compared this practice to "dismantling the machine and using the parts." As a result, many League organizations have fallen into a state of paralysis and cannot carry out work, and some League organizations have become dead in name only. The delegate from Jiangxi said that after November last year, there were 178 League cadres in the seventeen counties of the Nanchang area. After the transfer last year, only 32 League cadres were left (including those who were sick and women cadres on maternity leave). Later, the League cadres of some counties were completely transferred, such as Tonggu County and Yifeng County, where no one was in the League county committee office, so they had to close the door. Some people transferred their League relations to the organization department of the Party county committee, and the reception work was handled by the Women's Federation. This phenomenon also exists in other provinces.

    Frequent transfers of League cadres have seriously affected the development of League work. Now many Party committees often transfer the backbone members of the League and replace them with some "newcomers," resulting in a great weakening of the League's work in many areas. In Pixiang County, Jiangxi Province, almost all of the League's grassroots cadres were replaced in one year and eight months.

    Hopes and Demands

    The delegates present raised the following demands and hopes to Party committees at all levels:

    First, the shortcomings of League cadres are low quality, youth, and lack of experience. The current situation is developing rapidly, and the work of the League cannot keep up. Therefore, it is hoped that Party committees at all levels can provide more specific guidance to the work of the League. It is best for the Party committee to discuss the work of the Youth League regularly, rather than pushing the responsibility to a responsible comrade who is in charge of the work of the League.

    Second, it is hoped that the responsible comrades of the Party committee will often contact the League cadres, talk to them, and listen to the voices of the League cadres. This is a great encouragement to the League cadres. In the past, the responsible comrades of the Party committee and the League cadres only met at meetings, and there was very little contact in ideology and life.

    Third, it is hoped that when the higher-level Party committee trains grassroots Party member cadres, it can explain to them the nature, tasks, and role of the Youth League, so that they can have some understanding of the work of the Youth League and arouse their attention.

    Fourth, some delegates suggested that the management, deployment, and use of League cadres should preferably be jointly responsible by the Party committee at the same level and the League committee at the higher level, changing the current situation where some Party committees transfer the responsible cadres of the League committee at the same level without consulting the League committee at the higher level.

    Fifth, the current funding for League organizations is too small, and sometimes it is difficult to even hold meetings. Some places do not have money to print League membership application forms, which has a certain impact on the work of the League. It is hoped that some necessary funding can be increased for League organizations.

    In addition to these demands, some delegates also hoped that the Party Central Committee could have the opportunity to listen to the opinions of League cadres on Party committees at all levels, and they hoped that the Party Central Committee could also hold such a symposium. Some delegates hoped that the Party Central Committee could check the implementation of the instructions issued to Party committees at all levels in 1953 on strengthening the work of the Youth League in the near future, and issue a supplementary instruction based on the current new situation, which would have a great promoting effect on further improving the Party's leadership over the League.

    听一听青年团干部对党委领导的意见和要求
    本报邀请参加青年团第三次全国代表大会部分代表座谈党团关系问题
    本报讯　本报编辑部在5月14日邀请参加青年团第三次全国代表大会的部分代表座谈党团关系问题。
    到会的有省委、地委、县委级团的负责干部共二十二人。许多代表认为几年来，各级党委领导青年团工作的成绩是基本的。但他们同时指出，各级党委对青年团工作领导方面缺点还不少，这些缺点比较集中地表现在以下几个方面。
    管不管这个“助手”？
    这是代表们对一些党委提出的一个问题。许多代表说，许多县级党委不了解青年团的性质、任务和作用，不了解青年工作的特点，甚至根本不关心青年团的工作。山东省代表说，在他们那里，许多党的县委长期不讨论团的工作。譬如，1953年10月中央发出关于加强青年团工作的指示后，不少县委就不研究，不执行。青年团省代表大会后，省的党委批转了这个大会的报告，可是莱阳地区十五个县，只有四个县的党委讨论了这个报告，其他各县都没有讨论。现在大部分团县委书记不是党的县委会的委员，而党的县委会开会时也没有让他们列席，这样就很难及时了解党委的意图，也很难根据党委的意图来布置自己的工作。浙江代表说，县的党委不但不考虑青年团的特点，甚至多方面限制青年团的独立活动。譬如精简会议，首先就精简青年团的会议，不管应开不应开，党委不批准他们就不能开。有些地区有一种奇怪的现象：积极作团的工作的党员不是受到党组织的鼓励，而是常受到党组织的批评。广东乐昌县团县委工作比较主动，县的党委就说他们“自作聪明”。浙江湖州丝厂一个预备党员担任团分支书记，有一次党支部书记对他说：“你的工作很好，只是对团的工作太关心了！”这个预备党员以后就担心是否会因为多做了团的工作而不能转正。上海代表说，上海有些企业中，一些热心团的工作的同志常被扣上“闹独立性”“本位主义”“先锋主义”等帽子。
    少数党委负责干部甚至认为青年团组织可有可无。中共河南获嘉县县委书记对团县委书记当面就这样说：“青年团有没有都可以。”
    “呼之即来，挥之即去”
    代表们用这两句话概括有些党委对青年团的领导方式，这种领导方式和上面一些对青年团的错误认识是分不开的。许多代表说，完全不要青年团，这种情况还不多，一般的情况是只使用，不教育；只批评，不帮助。要用你时抓一把，不用你时就搁在一边。乡、社中的团干部感到很苦闷，他们比喻自己是“打短工的”，没有经常工作。浙江代表估计，乡社团干部中约有70％到80％不安心工作。这种思想的产生有各种原因，而团的工作得不到党组织的重视、支持和帮助也是重要原因之一。许多代表说，在乡、社中，青年团的工作总是放在最后来考虑。
    党委对青年团工作批评和指责过多，也影响团干部的工作积极性。有的代表说，过去有一个时期，党委很重视青年，看到青年的优点多，但目前有些变了，有些党委负责干部好挑青年毛病，不加分析地认为青年缺点多，不好管，因而对青年的活动不信任，不支持。山东代表举了一个例子：去秋海阳县准备开展青储饲料工作，县党委开始同意，说每个社可以搞一个地窖来作储藏饲料用，但接着又说每个乡搞一个够了；最后则又根本推翻，说不搞了，甚至连已经储好的饲料也给挖掉了。什么理由呢？就是不相信青年团员能把青储饲料的工作搞好，实际上莱阳专区去年储藏玉米秆子三千多万斤，坏了的只有二万多斤。对青年农业生产队的看法也有些片面，只批评缺点，而不看到成绩。河南获嘉县青年团去年想开展搞玉米授粉工作，党县委反对，并且批评青年团“闹独立性”。
    “拆机器，用零件”
    抓团干部，不抓团组织；任意调动团干部，抽调团干部去做别的工作。这种情况去年秋天以来比较严重而普遍。有些代表比喻这种做法叫作“拆机器，用零件”，这样做的结果使得不少团组织陷于瘫痪的境地，不能开展工作，有的团组织被弄得名存实亡。江西代表说，去年11月份后，南昌专区十七个县，原有团干部一百七十八名，去年抽调后，只剩下团干部三十二人（包括有病的、妇女干部产假的），后来竟把有些县的团干部全部抽完了，如铜鼓县、宜丰县团委机关没有人，只好把大门关上。有人转团的关系，到党县委组织部去转，收发工作则由妇联代办。这种现象其他省也有。
    团干部调动频繁，严重地影响了团的工作的开展。现在不少党委经常把团的骨干分子调走，用一些“生手”来代替，结果就使许多地区的团的工作大大削弱。江西萍乡县在一年另八个月时间内，团的基层干部几乎是全部换了一班人马。
    希望和要求
    到会的代表对各级党委提出了下列要求和希望：
    一、团干部的缺点是质量低，年青，缺乏经验。目前形势发展快，团的工作跟不上，因此希望各级党委能够对团的工作多作具体指导，党委最好定期讨论青年团的工作，而不要把责任推给一个专管团的工作的负责同志。
    二、希望党委负责同志经常和团干部接触，谈谈心，听听团干部的呼声，这对团干部是莫大的鼓励。过去党委负责同志和团干部只在会议上见面，思想上、生活上接触是很少的。
    三、希望上级党委在训练基层党员干部时能够向他们讲解一下青年团的性质、任务和作用，使他们对青年团工作有所认识，引起重视。
    四、有些代表提出，关于团干部的管理、调配和使用问题，最好能由同级党委和上级团委共同负责，改变目前有些党委不与上级团委商量就随便调走同级团委的负责干部的情况。
    五、团组织目前经费过少，有时开会都感到困难，有的地方印刷入团志愿书都没有钱，这对团的工作有一定影响，希望能够给团组织增加一些必要的经费。
    除这些要求外，有些代表还希望党中央能够有机会听取团干部对各级党委的意见，他们希望党中央也能够举行这样一个座谈会。有的代表希望党中央在最近能够检查一次1953年发的关于加强青年团工作给各级党委的指示的执行情况，并且根据目前的新形势，再发一个补充指示，这样对进一步改善党对团的领导会产生极大的推动作用。
