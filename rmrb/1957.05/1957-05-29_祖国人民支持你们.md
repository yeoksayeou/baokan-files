    The People of the Motherland Support You
  　Xie Nanguang
    To protest against the U.S. military authorities stationed in Taiwan for releasing an American soldier who murdered the Chinese man Liu Ziran, tens of thousands of Taipei citizens destroyed the U.S. Embassy. I feel extremely excited and admire the heroic actions and righteous spirit of the people of Taiwan. The actions of the Taiwanese people will be supported by the 600 million people of the motherland. Now the United States is conscripting more than 200,000 young people in Taiwan into Chiang Kai-shek's army, intending to use the blood of our Taiwanese compatriots to invade our motherland. I believe that one day the young people of Taiwan will use the enemy's planes and artillery to crush the enemy's conspiracy to invade Taiwan. The actions of the Taiwan compatriots now are the beginning of the anti-imperialist and anti-American struggle. I hope that the Taiwan compatriots will persevere. You are not isolated. Not only are the 600 million people of the motherland supporting you, but also the more than one billion people around the world who love peace and oppose colonialism are supporting you. We hope that the Taiwan compatriots will develop from the Liu Ziran incident to the struggle against the United States and against imperialism, and to the struggle to drive out U.S. imperialism and liberate Taiwan. No matter how great the pressure from the United States is, as long as the eight million Taiwan compatriots are closely united with the 600 million people of the motherland, we will certainly be able to complete the task of resisting the United States, opposing imperialism, and peacefully liberating Taiwan. I hope that the Taiwan compatriots will continue their efforts. The people of the motherland are unanimously supporting your sacred struggle.

    祖国人民支持你们
  　谢南光
    为了抗议驻台湾美军当局释放一个杀死中国人刘自然的凶手美国士兵，台北市民万多人捣毁了美国大使馆，对于台湾人民的这种英勇行动和见义勇为的精神，我感到万分兴奋和钦佩。台湾人民的行动将得到祖国六亿人民的支持。现在美国在台湾征用二十多万青年到蒋介石的军队里面去，想利用我们台湾同胞的鲜血来侵略我们的祖国。我相信台湾青年总有一天会利用敌人的飞机大炮来粉碎敌人侵略台湾的阴谋。现在台湾同胞的行动就是反帝抗美斗争的开端。我希望台湾同胞们坚持下去。你们不是孤立的，不但六亿的祖国人民在支持你们，全世界爱好和平和反殖民主义的十多亿人民都在支持你们。我们希望台湾同胞从刘自然事件发展到抗美反帝的斗争，发展到赶走美帝国主义解放台湾的斗争。不管美国的压力有多大，只要八百万台湾同胞同祖国六亿人民紧紧团结在一起，我们一定能够完成抗美反帝和平解放台湾的任务。希望台湾同胞们再接再厉，祖国人民一致在支持着你们的神圣的斗争。
