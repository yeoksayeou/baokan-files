All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce Voices Support for Taiwan Compatriots' Anti-American Struggle

    This newspaper reports that the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce spokesperson issued a statement on the 29th, voicing support for the anti-American patriotic struggle of Taiwan compatriots. The spokesperson said: From the tragic killing of Liu Ziran in this incident, one can imagine how rampant the American aggressors' atrocities of disregarding human life and bullying our compatriots have become during their eight years of occupying Taiwan. Now, Taiwan compatriots have been aroused to an anti-American upsurge to resist the American aggressors' arbitrary killing of Chinese people, which is a heroic manifestation of the patriotic tradition of the Taiwan people. He represents the national industrialists and businessmen to express his utmost sympathy and full support for the just struggle of the Taiwan people.
    The spokesperson finally called on all peace-loving countries and people in the world to unite together, vigorously support the just struggle of the Taiwanese people and other countries and nations ravaged by the U.S. military, completely eliminate colonialism, and defend human dignity and lasting world peace.

    全国工商联声援台湾同胞反美斗争
    本报讯　全国工商联负责人于29日发表谈话，声援台湾同胞的反美爱国斗争。负责人说：从这次刘自然惨遭杀害的事件中，可以想见美国侵略者在霸占台湾的八年中，草菅人命、鱼肉我国同胞的暴行是越来越猖狂了。现在台湾同胞为反抗美国侵略者任意杀害中国人民而激起了反美高潮，这是台湾人民爱国主义传统的英勇表现。他代表全国工商业者对台湾人民的正义斗争表示万分的同情和全力的支持。
    负责人最后呼吁全世界爱好和平的国家和人民，一致团结起来，大力支持我国台湾人民和其他被美军蹂躏的国家和民族的正义斗争，彻底消灭殖民主义，保卫人类的尊严和世界的持久和平。
