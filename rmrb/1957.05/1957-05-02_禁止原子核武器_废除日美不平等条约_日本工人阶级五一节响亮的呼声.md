Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 1st: Three million eight hundred thousand working people in Japan held May Day rallies in approximately eight hundred locations across the country today, marking the largest May Day celebrations in Japanese history. Through these rallies, the Japanese working class is pushing the movement to prohibit nuclear weapons, abolish the unequal U.S.-Japan treaty, and demand wage increases to a new climax.

	Of particular note was the "Central Rally" held at Meiji Jingu Outer Garden in Tokyo, attended by 500,000 people. This rally was jointly organized by various labor unions in Japan, symbolizing the unity of the Japanese working class.

	The rally officially began at 10:00 AM. Representatives from labor unions, political parties, and mass organizations spoke at the rally.

	Suzuki Mosaburo, Chairman of the Japan Socialist Party, said in his address that the Soviet Union and China are celebrating May Day with hope, but Japan is celebrating May Day under the "world domination" policy of the United States and the reactionary power of the Japanese ruling class. Suzuki emphasized the necessity of establishing normal relations between Japan and China. He said that the recent goodwill delegation of the Japan Socialist Party to China achieved great results. Suzuki also demanded the abolition of the unequal U.S.-Japan treaty, so that Japan could break away from U.S. control and achieve independence; the prohibition of nuclear weapons, with the U.S., Britain, and the Soviet Union concluding an international disarmament agreement; and the establishment of a minimum wage system to stabilize workers' lives.

	Nosaka Sanzo, First Secretary of the Japanese Communist Party, called on the working people at the rally to strengthen unity and advance, abolish the unequal U.S.-Japan treaty, and strive for complete independence. He said that all American soldiers are ordered to stay in their bases today and are not allowed to go out. This shows that our working class can achieve something as long as we are united. If we remain united, the Americans will have to get out.

	Subsequently, the rally passed a number of resolutions amidst applause. The resolution on striving for world peace and complete independence for Japan pointed out that the Japanese working class must launch a struggle, carry out a national movement to abolish unequal treaties, stop atomic and hydrogen bombs, and further completely prohibit nuclear weapons and reduce armaments. At the same time, it is necessary to expand the united front, defend the peaceful constitution, oppose military bases, and oppose various reactionary laws. The resolution said that such a struggle, if it does not take the working class as its core, does not go deep into the people, and does not have international solidarity, cannot be victorious. The resolution expressed its determination to develop this struggle with the united and unified strength of the working class around the world.

	The rally declaration was read at the meeting, strongly demanding that the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and workers and public opinion around the world prohibit atomic and hydrogen bombs. The declaration called on Japanese workers to unite, defend their lives and rights, freedom and peace. The declaration said, we guarantee that all labor unions will unite together as they are today.

	After the meeting, the masses marched in five routes. For the first time in this year's May Day parade, members of small and medium-sized labor unions and workers' families appeared.

    禁止原子核武器  废除日美不平等条约
    日本工人阶级五一节响亮的呼声
    据新华社1日讯  东京消息：日本三百八十万劳动人民今天在全国约八百个地方举行日本历史上规模最大的“五一”节集会。日本工人阶级通过这些大会把禁止原子核武器、废除日美不平等条约和要求增加工资的运动推向新的高潮。
    最引人注意的是在东京明治神宫外苑举行的有五十万人参加的“中央大会”。这个大会是由日本各派工会联合组织的，它象征着日本工人阶级的团结。
    大会在十时正式开始。工会、政党和群众团体的代表在大会上讲话。
    日本社会党委员长铃木茂三郎在致词中说，苏联和中国是在充满希望中庆祝“五一”节，但是，日本是在美国的“统治世界”的政策和日本统治阶级的反动权利之下庆祝“五一”节。铃木强调日本同中国建立正常关系的必要性。他说，最近访问中国的日本社会党亲善使节团获得了巨大的成果。铃木并且要求废除日美不平等条约，使日本摆脱美国的控制而取得独立；禁止核武器，美、英、苏三国缔结国际裁军协定；建立最低工资制，使工人生活稳定。
    日本共产党第一书记野坂参三在大会上号召劳动人民加强团结和前进，废除日美不平等条约和争取完全独立。他说，所有的美国兵今天都奉命留在他们的基地里，不许外出。这就说明我们工人阶级只要团结起来就能够有所作为。如果我们保持团结，美国人就得滚回去。
    接着，大会在鼓掌声中通过了一些决议。关于争取世界和平和日本完全独立的决议指出，日本工人阶级必须展开斗争，开展废除不平等条约国民运动，阻止原子弹和氢弹，进而完全禁止核武器和裁减军备。同时，必须扩大统一战线，保卫和平宪法，反对军事基地，反对各种反动法律。决议说，这种斗争，如果不是以工人阶级为核心，不深入人民，没有国际团结，是不能胜利的。决议表示决心以全世界工人阶级的团结和统一的力量来发展这种斗争。
    在会上宣读了大会宣言，宣言向美、英、苏三国以及全世界工人和舆论强烈要求禁止原子弹和氢弹。宣言号召日本工人团结起来，保卫生活和权利、自由和和平。宣言说，我们保证所有的工会像今天一样地团结在一起。
    会后，群众分五路游行。在今年的“五一”节游行队伍中第一次出现了中小工会的会员和工人家属。
