    After the Cancellation of Beijing's Free Vegetable Market:
    Long Queues and Public Grievances

    Since Beijing cancelled the free vegetable markets on May 6th, the phenomenon of consumers queuing to buy vegetables has become even more common because the vegetable company's retail business is insufficient to meet demand.

    At the Xicaochang Market in the Qianmen District on May 8th, there were only two vegetable carts from the joint operation team, and both the variety and quantity were inadequate. By a little after 7:00 a.m., the vegetables were almost sold out, but there were still twenty or thirty people in line waiting to buy; the vegetable stores and stalls at Dongsi Pai Lou and Xisi Pai Lou also had long queues. The masses felt inconvenienced and had many complaints. A citizen in the Xisi District said, "The state's unified management of vegetables has indeed lowered the price somewhat, but we can't get scallions anymore." One citizen went to the Xuanwu District People's Committee and questioned, "What am I supposed to do if you manage things so that I can't buy vegetables all day?"

    After the unified management of vegetables by the vegetable company, the vegetables are noticeably not as fresh as they were in the original free markets. Some people have reported that although the prices of vegetables from the vegetable company are lower, the quality is poor, so relatively speaking, they are not cheaper.

    Due to the insufficient supply of vegetables, especially the lack of scallions and chives, some farmers and peddlers have been found to be smuggling scallions and other items from other places into the city for sale, at prices even higher than those of the original free markets. A joint operation vegetable group outside Chaoyangmen purchased 4,000 jin of scallions directly from Tongxian because the quantity supplied by the state-owned company was too small, and the income from selling vegetables was not enough to maintain their livelihood. ·Wang Ling·

    北京市蔬菜自由市场取消后
    排队排得长　群众有怨言
    北京市从5月6日取消蔬菜自由市场以后，由于菜蔬公司零售业务不敷需要，消费者排队买菜的现象更加普遍了。
    前门区西草厂市场，5月8日仅有联营组的两个菜车，品种、数量都嫌不足，早晨七点多钟，菜就快卖完了，但还排有二三十人的队伍等着买；东四牌楼、西四牌楼的菜店和菜摊也都有长长的队伍，群众感到不方便，颇有怨言。西四区的一个市民说：“国家统一经营蔬菜，价钱确实降低了一些，但是吃不到小葱了。”有一位市民到宣武区人民委员会质问：“你们管的叫我一天买不到菜，怎么办？”
    蔬菜统一由菜蔬公司经营以后，已显著不如原来自由市场上的新鲜。有人反映，菜蔬公司的菜价钱虽然低些，但质量不好，相对地说，并不便宜。
    由于蔬菜货源不足，小葱、韭菜等特别缺乏，已发现有些农民和小贩从外地私运小葱等潜入市内出售，价格较原来的自由市场还高；朝阳门外一个联营蔬菜小组由于国营公司供应数量太少，卖菜所得不足维持生活，因此直接向通县购进小葱四千斤。　·王令·
