Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, 18th - The Hungarian Council of Ministers recently approved the 1957 National Economic Development Plan.

The plan states that the formulation of the 1957 national economic plan has been greatly affected by the loss of 20 billion forints (Hungarian currency) caused by the counter-revolutionary events last year. This year, Hungary obtained goods loans of 874 million rubles and free foreign exchange of 264 million rubles from the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries. Thanks to the production achievements in the first quarter of this year, especially the achievements in the coal mining industry, other industries have the conditions for development. However, the national economy has not yet returned to equilibrium, and the task for this fiscal year is to lay a solid foundation for future development.

The plan states that, in terms of industry, this year's planned industrial production will be mainly affected by power and raw materials. According to the plan, this year, it will produce 20.5 million tons of coal, 5.3 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, 860,000 tons of cement, 770,000 tons of steel, and 632,000 tons of petroleum. The entire industrial production this year will increase by 2.4% compared to the actual production last year (but will be 11.2% lower than last year's planned production target), of which light industry will increase by 9%, and heavy industry will be reduced by 4%. Labor productivity will reach the level before October of last year before the fourth quarter of this year.

In agriculture, this year's planting plan has been changed. Compared with last year, the grain planting area has been reduced by 480,000 holds (each hold is equivalent to 8.5 mu), and the sugar beet planting area has been reduced by 55,000 holds, while the planting area of ​​feed crops, especially corn, has been greatly increased.

This year's national income will increase by 0.5% to 1% compared to last year, but will be 9% less than the 1956 plan. Residents' purchasing power will increase by 13.8% compared to last year, and actual wages will increase by about 15%. Due to the large increase in total consumption, the total amount of reserves will be greatly reduced. The investment in 1957 is 8.2 billion forints, which is 36% less than last year's plan. Due to the reduction in investment, large-scale changes in the structure of enterprises that were originally planned to start this year will not be allowed.

The plan calls for strict economy, further increase in the total amount of commodities to ensure the balance between supply and demand, and it is necessary to develop foreign trade and strive for profitability. (Attached picture)
    Hungarian industrial production is gradually normalizing, and trade relations between many large factories and Asian and African countries have also been restored. This is the second tugboat built by the Hungarian "Obuda" shipyard for Syria undergoing sea trials on the Danube.

    为今后发展打下巩固基础
    匈牙利确定今年经济计划
    新华社布达佩斯18日电　匈牙利部长会议最近通过了1957年发展国民经济计划。
    计划说，由于去年反革命事件造成了二百亿福林（匈币）的损失，1957年国民经济计划的制定受到了很大影响。今年匈牙利从苏联和人民民主国家获得了八亿七千四百万卢布的货物贷款和二亿六千四百万卢布的自由外汇。由于今年第一季度的生产成就，特别是由于煤矿工业的生产成就使其他工业有了发展的条件。但是现在国民经济还没有恢复平衡，今年财政年度的任务是，为今后发展打下巩固的基础。
    计划说，在工业方面，今年计划的工业生产主要要受动力和原料的影响。根据计划，今年将生产二千零五十万吨煤，五十三亿度电，八十六万吨水泥，七十七万吨钢和六十三万二千吨石油。今年整个工业生产将比去年实际生产增长2.4％（但比去年计划生产指标降低了11.2％），其中轻工业将增长9％，重工业则缩减4％。劳动生产率在今年第四季度以前将达到去年10月以前的水平。
    在农业方面，今年改变了播种计划。同去年相比，谷物播种面积减少了四十八万霍尔特（每霍尔特合八点五市亩），甜菜播种面积减少了五万五千霍尔特，而饲料作物，特别是玉蜀黍的播种面积大大增加了。
    今年国民收入将比去年提高0.5％到1％，而比1956年计划要减少9％。居民购买力将比去年提高13.8％，实际工资约提高15％。由于消费总值的大大增加，储备总额将大大缩减。1957年的投资为八十二亿福林，比去年计划少36％。由于投资减少就不允许大规模进行本来要在今年开始的改变企业结构的工作。
    计划要求实行严格的节约，要进一步增加商品总额，以保证供求之间的平衡，并且必须发展对外贸易和争取盈利。（附图片）
    匈牙利工业生产逐渐正常，许多大工厂和亚非国家的贸易关系也恢复了。这是匈牙利“峨布达”造船厂为叙利亚造的第二艘拖船正在多瑙河上试航。
