Xinhua News Agency, 9th -- The Party Group and Party Committee of the Ministry of Public Security held a joint meeting this afternoon to discuss and determine the rectification plan of the Ministry of Public Security.

The meeting believed that this rectification has a particularly important significance for public security departments. This is because public security organs are one of the tools of the people's democratic dictatorship. Its task is to protect the interests of the people, punish enemies according to law, and maintain close contact with the masses in its work. If a public security organ or a public security officer fails to clearly distinguish between contradictions between the enemy and ourselves and contradictions among the people, and handles them improperly, serious errors may occur. The current reality is that many public security cadres still lack sufficient understanding of the fundamental changes that have taken place in China's political situation, so they often continue to follow outdated or erroneous views and methods in their work. At the same time, a small number of public security cadres have become arrogant because of their achievements in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. Ideologically, they cannot distinguish between contradictions among the people and contradictions between the enemy and ourselves. This requires public security cadres to catch up with the needs of the situation through this rectification, to strictly distinguish and correctly handle contradictions among the people and contradictions between the enemy and ourselves, and to further improve public security work in the new situation of social upheaval.

The rectification plan adopted by the meeting determined the issues that should be focused on and resolved in the rectification. The first issue is to strictly distinguish and correctly handle contradictions among the people and contradictions between the enemy and ourselves. Inspect and prevent the confusion of contradictions among the people with contradictions between the enemy and ourselves, and the use of methods for resolving contradictions between the enemy and ourselves to deal with issues among the people. In addition, the tendency to treat contradictions between the enemy and ourselves as contradictions among the people must also be inspected and corrected. Through this inspection, summarize the experience of strictly distinguishing and correctly handling contradictions among the people and contradictions between the enemy and ourselves.

The second is to examine the relationship between public security organs and the people. Examine the problems existing in the attitude of public security organs towards the people and their service to the people. Through this inspection, the goal is to completely eliminate the privileged thinking of some public security personnel, continue to overcome and prevent mystification and special privileges, and further rely on the masses and maintain close ties with the masses. The plan determines that the implementation of the united front policy by public security organs should also be examined in this rectification. The meeting criticized the erroneous view held by some public security cadres that public security work does not require attention to the united front and does not accept supervision from democratic parties. The meeting believed that public security organs, like other state organs, should accept the supervision of democratic parties and fight against the enemy with them. In practical work, it is necessary to unite all forces that can be united to consolidate the new socialist order.

The rectification plan of the Ministry of Public Security also determined that it is necessary to examine whether public security organs strictly abide by the rule of law in their work: the relationship between superiors and subordinates within the public security system, between leaders and those led within the Ministry of Public Security, and between the Party and the masses, as well as the implementation of the policy of building the country through diligence and thrift.

The meeting requested that "learning, rectification, and correction should be carried out simultaneously" in the rectification movement. In particular, the new situations and new problems that have already been discovered in the handling of contradictions among the people and contradictions between the enemy and ourselves, as well as other aspects of work, must be promptly studied and resolved.

    公安部确定整风计划
    遵守法制防止特殊化
    执行统战政策接受监督
    新华社9日讯　公安部党组和党委会今天下午举行联席会议，讨论并确定了公安部的整风计划。
    会议认为，这次整风对公安部门有着特殊重要的意义。这是因为，公安机关是人民民主专政的工具之一，它的任务是保护人民利益，依法惩办敌人，并且在工作中同人民群众有着十分密切的联系。如果有一个公安机关，有一个公安人员，对于敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾区别不清，处理不当，就可能发生严重的错误。而当前的实际情况是，许多公安干部对我国政治形势已发生了根本变化这一问题还缺乏足够的认识，因此在工作上往往仍然因袭已经过时的、或者是错误的观点和方法。同时，还有少数公安干部因为在肃反斗争中有成绩而骄傲起来。他们在思想上分不清人民内部矛盾和敌我矛盾。这样就要求公安干部通过这次整风，迅速赶上形势的需要，做到严格地区别和正确地处理人民内部矛盾和敌我矛盾，在社会大变动时期的新形势下，进一步做好公安工作。
    会议通过的整风计划，确定了在整风中应当着重检查和解决的问题。第一个问题是要严格地区别和正确地处理人民内部矛盾和敌我矛盾。检查和防止把人民内部矛盾同敌我矛盾混淆起来，用解决敌我矛盾的方法去处理人民内部问题。另外，对于把敌我矛盾当成人民内部问题来处理的偏向，也要进行检查和纠正。通过这项检查，总结出严格地区别和正确地处理人民内部矛盾和敌我矛盾的经验。
    第二要检查公安机关和人民群众的关系。检查公安机关在对待人民群众的态度和为人民服务等方面所存在的问题。通过这项检查，要达到彻底地扫除某些公安人员中的特权思想，继续克服和防止神秘化、特殊化，进一步依靠群众和密切联系群众的目的。计划确定在这次整风中还要检查公安机关执行统一战线政策的情况。会议在讨论这个问题时批判了有些公安干部认为公安工作可以不讲统一战线，不接受民主党派监督的错误看法。会议认为，公安机关应当和其他国家机关一样，接受民主党派的监督，和他们一起同敌人进行斗争。并要在实际工作中，团结一切可能团结的力量，巩固社会主义的新秩序。
    公安部整风计划中还确定要检查公安机关在工作上是否严格遵守法制的问题：公安系统内上级同下级之间、公安部内领导者同被领导者之间和党同群众之间的关系，以及贯彻勤俭建国的方针的情况。
    会议要求在整风运动中要做到“边学、边整、边改”。特别是对于目前公安机关在处理人民内部矛盾和敌我矛盾中已经发现的问题，以及其他各项业务工作中已经发生的新情况和新问题，必须及时研究和解决。
