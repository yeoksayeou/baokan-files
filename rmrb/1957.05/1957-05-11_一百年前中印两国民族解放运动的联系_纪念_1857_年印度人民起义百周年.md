    The Connection Between the National Liberation Movements of China and India a Century Ago
    ——Commemorating the Centenary of the Indian People's Uprising of 1857——

    May 10, 1957, marked the centenary of the Indian people's great anti-British uprising. This nationwide national liberation struggle dealt a heavy blow to British colonial rule in India, inspired the people of colonial and semi-colonial Asian countries to fight for freedom and independence, and wrote a glorious page in the history of Asian people's anti-colonialism.
    The Indian people's great uprising a century ago was not an isolated event. It occurred in an era of general upsurge in the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal movements of Asian countries, and these movements were interconnected in many ways. Taking China as an example, the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Revolution and the Second Opium War were almost parallel to the Indian uprising in terms of time. Although due to historical limitations, it was impossible for the Chinese and Indian people to establish direct cooperative relations at that time, the struggles of the Chinese and Indian people objectively played a positive role in coordinating with each other because the British aggressors were the common enemy of the two peoples. As we commemorate the centenary of the Indian people's uprising, we are reminded of the scene where the Chinese and Indian people supported each other and jointly contained the enemy in their respective national liberation struggles.
    The close connection between the national liberation struggles of the Chinese and Indian people in the mid-19th century can be clearly traced in the Second Opium War. As early as the early stages of this war, the Chinese people had already begun to receive support from the Indian people. At the beginning of 1857, after the British aggressors, who had provoked the war, were defeated by the heroic resistance of the Guangdong people, their Minister to China, Bowring, and Commander of the Far East Fleet, Seymour, repeatedly asked the Governor-General of India, Canning, for assistance, requesting him to "send five thousand men and a limited artillery force to Hong Kong as soon as possible" (Blue Book: "Elgin's Mission to China and Japan Documents," page 8). In the eyes of the British, India had always been an important base for their aggression against China. The British army that ravaged China during the First Opium War was mostly transferred from India. However, the British aggressors did not expect that India in 1857 was different from India in 1840. The consistent extreme and cruel colonial policy implemented by the British in India had ignited the flames of hatred on the vast Indian land. In the spring of 1857, conscious Indian soldiers held many small-scale anti-British riots in succession, foreshadowing the coming of a great storm of people's revolution. In this situation, the situation of the British authorities in India was obviously not much better than that of the British aggressors in China, and it was completely a vain illusion to transfer troops from India to fight China. Bowring and others' letters of request for help to Canning resulted in nothing, and were silently buried in the archives.
    In March of the same year, in order to get rid of its embarrassing situation in China, the British government decided to gather reinforcements from the mainland and Mauritius, and appointed Lord Elgin as the plenipotentiary envoy to conduct large-scale armed extortion in China. However, unexpectedly, this aggressive plan was powerfully sabotaged by the Indian people. Just as the British "expeditionary force" was being transferred eastward, the heroic Indian people launched the signal of the anti-British uprising from Meerut on May 10, Delhi was quickly occupied by the insurgents, and British colonial rule faced an unprecedented crisis of destruction. Not long ago, Bowring had asked Canning for help, but this time it was Canning's turn to ask Elgin for help. On June 3, Elgin passed through Singapore and immediately received an urgent official letter from Canning from India, recounting the situation of the Indian uprising as a raging fire, and imploring Elgin to immediately transfer the forces "expeditioning" to China to Calcutta in order to maintain the precarious rule of the British in the Bengal area. The "Blue Book" clearly records that although Elgin was eager to complete the mission of invading China, he had no choice but to accept Canning's request. In this way, the Indian people, with their resolute actions to fight for freedom and independence, dragged down the British aggressor army that was "expeditioning" to China, and once again powerfully cooperated with the Chinese people's anti-aggression war. Elgin had originally planned to immediately lead the "expeditionary force" to North China to force the Qing central government to sign new unequal treaties with force. However, due to the Indian uprising, this aggressive mission was forced to be delayed for a year before it had the opportunity to be carried out.
    For the Indian people, China's anti-aggression war also had a positive role in jointly containing the enemy. After the outbreak of the Indian uprising, the British attempted to concentrate all the forces in the Far East to suppress the Indian people first, and then turn around to deal with China; however, due to the Chinese people's uncompromising struggle against the aggressors, the British plan was never realized. In order to protect their own bandit interests, they had to continue to keep a considerable number of naval and army forces in China.
    In June 1857, the flames of the Indian uprising had spread to all parts of the Ganges River basin. The British rulers were panic-stricken and frightened. Canning repeatedly appealed to Elgin (who was in Hong Kong at this time) for more military assistance. However, despite this, Elgin, who was unable to take care of himself, could not draw much force from the Chinese battlefield. As he said in his report to Foreign Secretary Clarendon on July 29 of the same year: "In order to satisfy Lord Canning's request to the best of my ability, I made a special survey of the forces under my control. My conclusion is that... if we reduce a considerable amount of our navy here, we will take a great risk, because the British in the trading ports rely on the navy for protection, and our exchanges with Guangzhou also rely on the navy" ("Elgin's Mission to China and Japan Documents," page 26). In the end, Elgin adopted a wonderfully indescribable method of "spiritual support" for Canning. He only took two warships to Calcutta. According to his own explanation, this would be enough to encourage the morale of the British Indian army, because his appearance would make people think that "a large support army really came from China" ("Elgin's Mission to China and Japan Documents," page 26). The British aggressors were really stretched thin and exposed their poverty under the joint blows of the Chinese and Indian people.
    The Chinese people were warmly sympathetic to the heroic struggle of their Indian brothers. Every victory of the Indian people in their struggle for independence was an inspiring encouragement to the Chinese people. Although there were no self-run newspapers and periodicals reflecting social opinions in China at that time, it is not difficult for us to know the attitude of the broad masses of the Chinese people towards the Indian uprising from the fragmentary words recorded by the ruling class. Xue Fucheng's "Book of the Guangzhou Uprising of the Hanyang Ye Xiang" records: "The Guangdong people looked upon the British with extreme hatred, and spread rumors among themselves, or said that India, a British affiliated country, had rebelled, and the British army was defeated and lost its leaders..." It vaguely reveals the situation in which the people of Guangdong spread the news of the Indian uprising. At that time, Hua Tingjie, the magistrate of Nanhai County in Guangdong, wrote a book "The Whole Story of Touching the Fence" based on his personal experience, which gave a more detailed account of how the people of Guangdong welcomed the Indian uprising: "At that time, there were people who came from the petticoat road of Hong Kong,... or went to hear that its affiliated country, Bengal, was rebelling, and their army was defeated. After one or two months, it was also said that their army was defeated in Bengal, ambushed, and their entire army was wiped out, and a grand marshal was killed, or a consort was killed, and the chiefs were worried and helpless. The rumors spread around, and everyone said the same thing. When I asked Ye Xiang, he also said that the investigations from various places were consistent. Occasionally, I saw letters from merchants from Hong Kong, which were roughly the same, so the people were all very happy." Although the actual situation of the Indian uprising involved in this record is not entirely accurate (which was unavoidable at that time), it fully shows the deep concern of the Guangdong people for this uprising. At that time, Guangdong Province was at the forefront of the anti-aggression war, and it was geographically closer to India, and Hong Kong was even closer. Therefore, it is natural that the people of Guangdong learned about the news of the Indian uprising earliest and reacted most sensitively. Their sympathy and concern for the Indian uprising shows that the Chinese people had begun to realize the common interests of the oppressed nations in the anti-aggression struggle from the facts.
    The connection between the national liberation struggles of the Chinese and Indian people in the mid-19th century is also clearly reflected in the later history of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Revolution. This great struggle, which opened the prelude to the modern Chinese anti-imperialist and anti-feudal democratic revolution, was opposed by the British aggressors from the very beginning. The Indian uprising of 1857 was brutally suppressed by the British colonialists due to the betrayal of the feudal lords, and the Second Opium War also ended in China's defeat the following year. After this, the British aggressors openly opposed the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom and began to drive Indian soldiers to China to help the Qing government suppress the uprising people. From this sinful collusion of "using Asians to kill Asians," we more clearly realize the interconnection of the success or failure of the Chinese and Indian people's revolutions.
    However, the British aggressors forced Indian soldiers to participate in the suppression of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, which is only one aspect of the problem. We must also see the other side of the problem: The Indian soldiers who were directly or indirectly baptized by the storm of the great uprising of 1857-1859 could not make the British aggressors satisfied. When the British threw thousands of Indian soldiers (such as the 5th Bombay Infantry Regiment, the 22nd Punjab Infantry Regiment, etc.) into the battlefield against the Taiping Army one after another, although these soldiers were subjected to the high pressure and strict control of the British military authorities, some of the advanced among them took the initiative or volunteered to join the Taiping Army after being captured and educated by the Taiping Army, became comrades-in-arms of the Chinese revolutionary people, and turned their guns to counterattack all foreign interventionist forces, including the British army, together with the Taiping Army. This is a glorious page in the history of Sino-Indian relations, marking the budding of direct cooperation between the Chinese and Indian people against colonialism.
    According to the materials we have, the traces of Indians in the Taiping Army were first found in a record of Zeng Guofan, the deadly enemy of the Taiping Army. In a letter replying to Hu Linyi, he wrote: "I heard that the false Loyal King surrounded Yushan, and in fact, he brought several black barbarians with him" ("Zeng Wenzheng Gong Shudu," page 66. See the third volume of the World Book Company edition of the complete works). The event referred to here, where Li Xiucheng, the Loyal King of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, led troops to besiege Yushan, Jiangxi, took place in early 1861. The so-called "black barbarians" in the quotation are Indians, because the Qing ruling class usually called them "black barbarians," "black foreigners," or "black soldiers of Tianzhu." As everyone knows, when the Loyal King督军 attacked Shanghai in August 1860, the British aggressors forced Indian soldiers to fight against the Taiping Army. These few Indian fighters in the Loyal King's army most likely came from the British army stationed in Shanghai.
    Soon after, in the years when the Taiping Army launched the most severe struggle against foreign interventionist forces (1862-1863), on the Jiangzhe battlefield where such struggles were carried out most tragically, more and more conscious Indians joined the ranks of the Taiping Army and fought side by side with the Chinese people against foreign aggressors. The following are a few documented examples.
    On February 19, 1863, in a battle in Shaoxing, Zhejiang, there were "fifty or sixty black foreigners" cooperating with the Taiping Army to attack the city, and on the spot they killed the French officer Dartiffo, who was helping the Qing army ("Li Wenzhong Gong Zougao," Volume 3, pages 5-6).
    In the battle of Taicang, Jiangsu on May 2 of the same year, the Taiping Army who died included "three Indian native soldiers fighting side by side with the Taiping Army, who originally belonged to the 5th Bombay Native Infantry Regiment" (Wilson: "The Ever Victorious Army," page 152).
    In a battle on October 7 of the same year on Shili Changjie between Hangzhou and Yuhang, the Qing army and the French forces jointly claimed to have "killed many 'bandits' and shot dead a black barbarian among the 'bandits'" ("Zuo Wenxiang Gong Zougao" Initial Compilation, Volume 11, page 5).
    In addition to this, other records of Indians in the Taiping Army can also be found. For example, a British man who called himself Lingli wrote in a book that he and an "Indian partner" went from Shanghai to Suzhou in October 1863 to serve in the Taiping Army (Lingli: "Taiping Heavenly Kingdom," Volume 2, pages 632-636). In another place in the same book, it is also mentioned that at the beginning of 1865, an "East Indian of British affiliation" went to Zhangzhou with Bai Qiwenz et al. to join the Taiping Army in Fujian (page 800). Another example is Yao Ji's book "Xiao Cang Sang Ji," which records that on August 11, 1863, Indian soldiers in the Taiping Army were captured near Songjiang.
    These Indians who served in the Taiping Army were the pioneers who opened up the road to friendship between the Chinese and Indian people a century ago, and laid the initial foundation for the common opposition of the two peoples to colonialism. In their battles alongside the Chinese revolutionaries, they embodied the common interests of the two peoples in striving for national liberation. They were worthy of being the direct successors of the heroes of the 1857 uprising and the promoters of the immortal spirit of these heroes. As we remember the great Indian uprising, we also pay deep respect to these Indians who participated in the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Revolution.
    The precious history of mutual care and support between the Chinese and Indian people in the national liberation movement a century ago proves that the anti-colonialist interests of the two peoples have been consistent since a long time ago, and their destinies are closely related. Now, a century has passed, and the forces of imperialism have been expelled from the territory of our two countries, and the two peoples have won their respective independence. Today, under the common goal of safeguarding world peace and preventing imperialism from launching new wars, the Chinese and Indian people are guided by the Five Principles, carrying out more extensive and closer cooperation, and marching forward on the smooth road of friendship.

    一百年前中印两国民族解放运动的联系
    ——纪念1857年印度人民起义百周年——
                余绳武　张振鹍
    1957年5月10日，是印度人民反英大起义一百周年纪念日。这次全民性的民族解放斗争沉重地打击了英国在印度的殖民统治，鼓舞了殖民地、半殖民地亚洲各国人民争取自由独立的斗志，在亚洲人民反殖民主义历史上写下了光辉的一页。
    一百年前的印度人民大起义并不是孤立的事件，它发生在亚洲各国人民反帝国主义、反封建主义运动普遍高涨的年代，这些运动彼此间存在着多方面的联系。以中国来说，太平天国革命和第二次鸦片战争在时间上几乎都是同印度起义平行的；虽然由于历史条件的限制，中印人民当时还不可能建立直接的合作关系，但是因为英国侵略者是两国人民的共同敌人，所以无论中国或印度人民的斗争，客观上都发挥了互相配合的积极作用。我们纪念印度人民起义一百周年，使我们回忆起中印两国人民当年在各自的民族解放斗争中相互支援、共同牵制敌人的情景。
    十九世纪中叶中印两国人民解放斗争的密切联系，可以在第二次鸦片战争过程中找到清楚的线索。早在这次战争的初期，中国人民就已开始得到印度人民的声援。1857年初，当挑起战火的英国侵略者在广东人民英勇抗击下遭到挫败以后，他们的驻华公使包令和远东舰队司令西马糜各里曾一再向印度总督坎宁求援，要求他“尽可能地立即派遣五千人和一支有限的炮队到香港来”（蓝皮书：“额尔金出使中日文件”，页八）。在英国人的心目中，印度向来是他们侵略中国的重要基地，第一次鸦片战争期间蹂躏中国的英军，绝大部分就是从印度调来的。但是英国侵略者没有料到：1857年的印度已经不同于1840年，英国在印度所实行的一贯的极端残酷的殖民政策，已经在广大的印度土地上燃起仇恨的火焰。1857年春天，觉悟的印度士兵连续举行许多次小规模的反英暴动，预示着人民革命大风暴的即将到来。在这种情况下，印度英国当局的处境显然并不比在中国的英国侵略者顺利多少，从印度调兵打中国完全是虚妄的幻想。包令等给坎宁的求援信结果是石沉大海，在档案柜中无声无息地埋葬了。
    同年3月，英国政府为摆脱它在中国的狼狈处境，决定远从本土及毛里求斯岛等地调集援兵，并任命额尔金勋爵充当全权特使，到中国来进行大规模武装勒索。但是出乎侵略者意料之外，这个侵略计划又遭到印度人民的有力破坏。正当英国“远征军”源源东调的时候，英勇的印度人民在5月10日从米勒特城发出了反英大起义的信号，德里很快被起义者攻占，英国的殖民统治面临着空前未有的复灭危机。不久以前包令还曾向坎宁乞援，这次却轮到坎宁向额尔金求救了。6月3日额尔金途经新加坡，他立即收到坎宁从印度寄发的一封火急公文，历述印度起义如火燎原的形势，并恳求额尔金把“远征”中国的兵力立刻调往加尔各答，借以维持英国在孟加拉一带摇摇欲坠的统治秩序。“蓝皮书”中清清楚楚地记载着：尽管额尔金急于完成侵略中国的使命，结果却不得不接受坎宁的请求。这样，印度人民用争取自由独立的坚决行动，拖住了“远征”中国的英国侵略军，再一次有力地配合了中国人民的反侵略战争。额尔金原定立即率领“远征军”前往华北，用武力逼迫清朝中央政府签订新的不平等条约。然而由于印度起义，这项侵略任务竟被迫延迟到一年以后才有机会执行。
    对印度人民来说，中国的反侵略战争同样具有共同牵制敌人的积极作用。在印度起义爆发后，英国人曾企图集中在远东的全部兵力先把印度人民镇压下去，再转头对付中国；但是由于中国人民对侵略者展开不妥协的斗争，竟使英国人这一打算始终未能实现，他们为了保护自己的强盗利益，不得不把相当数量的海陆军继续留在中国。
  1857年6月间，印度起义的火焰已蔓延到恒河流域各地，英国统治者草木皆兵，惊惶失措，坎宁接连向额尔金（这时他在香港）告急，要求给予更多的军事援助。然而尽管如此，自顾不暇的额尔金却无法从中国战场抽出多少兵力。正如他在同年7月29日给外交大臣克拉兰登的报告中所说：“为了尽最大能力去满足坎宁勋爵的请求，我特把属我支配的兵力调查了一下。我所得到的结论是，……如果把我们这里的海军减少相当数量，那就要冒很大的危险，因为各通商口岸的英人都赖海军保护，我们同广州之间的往来也依靠海军维持”（“额尔金出使中日文件”，页二六）。最后额尔金对坎宁采取了一种妙不可言的“精神支援”方法，他仅仅带着两只兵船到加尔各答跑了一趟。据他自己解释，这样一来就足以鼓励印度英军的士气，因为他的出现会使人认为“真的从中国来了一大支援军”（“额尔金出使中日文件”，页二六）。英国侵略者在中印两国人民共同打击下真是捉襟见肘，穷相毕露了。
    中国人民对于印度弟兄的英勇斗争抱着热烈的同情，印度人民在独立斗争中的每个胜利，对中国人民都是振奋人心的鼓舞力量。虽然当时中国还没有自办的反映社会舆论的报刊，但从统治阶级记载的片言只字中，我们还是不难知道广大中国人民对印度起义的态度。薛福成“书汉阳叶相广州之变”一文记载：“粤民疾视英人，互播流言，或称英属国印度已叛，英兵败绩，连丧其渠……”。其中隐约透露广东人民把印度起义消息奔走相告的情况。当时广东南海知县华廷杰根据亲身经历所写的“触藩始末”一书，对广东人民如何欢迎印度起义有较详细的记述：“时有自香港裙带路来者，……或去闻伊属国孟加拉作叛，彼军战败。逾一二月又云，彼军在孟加拉大败，中埋伏，复其全军，亡一大帅，或谓亡一驸马，诸酋忧惶无措云云。展转传言，众口如一。质之叶相亦云各处探报相符。偶见客商自香港来信，大略亦同，于是人心俱大喜”。这段记载所涉及的印度起义实况虽不尽准确（这在当时是难免的），但充分表明了广东人民对这次起义的深切关怀。当时广东省处在反侵略战争的前线，而且地理上距印度较近，香港更近在咫尺，因此广东人民对印度起义的消息获悉最早，反映最敏锐，这是很自然的。他们对印度起义的同情和关心，说明中国人民已从事实中开始认识到被压迫民族在反侵略斗争中的共同利害关系。
    十九世纪中叶中印两国民族解放斗争的联系，在太平天国革命后期历史中也获得清楚的反映。这个揭开了近代中国反帝国主义反封建主义民主革命序幕的伟大斗争，从开始便遭到英国侵略者的敌视。1857年的印度起义因封建主的叛变而遭到英国殖民者残酷镇压，第二次鸦片战争也在第二年以中国的失败而告结束。在此以后，英国侵略者更公开同太平天国为敌，开始驱使印度士兵到中国来帮助清政府镇压起义人民。从这一“以亚洲人杀亚洲人”的罪恶勾当中，我们愈加清楚地认识到中印两国人民革命成败的相互关连。
    但是，英国侵略者强迫印度士兵参与对太平天国的镇压，这只是问题的一个方面。我们还必须看到问题的另一面：直接间接受到1857—1859年大起义风暴的洗礼的印度士兵，并不可能使英国侵略者称心如意。当英国把千百印度士兵（如孟买士兵第五步兵团、旁遮普士兵第二十二步兵团等）先后投到反太平军的战场上时，尽管这些士兵遭受着英军当局的高压和严密控制，他们之中的若干先进者却主动地或在被俘并受到太平军的教育后志愿地参加了太平军，成了中国革命人民的战友，倒转枪口同太平军一起反击包括英军在内的一切外国干涉军。这是中印关系史上的光辉一页，它标志着中印人民反对殖民主义的直接合作的萌芽。
    就我们所掌握的材料看来，太平军中印度人的踪迹最早见于太平军死敌曾国藩的一段记载。他在一封复胡林翼的信中写道：“闻伪忠王围玉山，实挟有黑夷数人同行”（“曾文正公书牍”，页六六。见世界书局版全集第三册）。这里所指太平天国忠王李秀成统兵围攻江西玉山的事，时间是在1861年初。引文中的所谓“黑夷”就是印度人，因为当时清统治阶级通常把他们称为“黑夷”、“黑洋人”或“天竺国黑兵”。大家知道，当1860年8月忠王督军进攻上海时，英国侵略者曾强迫印度士兵对太平军作战。忠王军队中这几个印度战士，很可能来自侵驻上海的英方军队。
    此后不久，在太平军同外国干涉军展开最严酷的斗争的年代里（1862—1863年），在那种斗争进行得最惨烈的江浙战场上，越来越多的觉悟的印度人投入了太平军的营垒，同中国人民并肩进行抗击外国侵略者的斗争。下面是几个见诸记载的实例。
    1863年2月19日，在浙江绍兴的一次战斗中，有“黑洋人五六十名”同太平军协力攻城，并当场击毙了帮助清军的法国军官达耳第福（“李文忠公奏稿”，卷三，页五—六）。
    同年5月2日江苏太仓一战，在殉难的太平军中包括有“同太平军并肩作战的印度土兵三名，他们原先是属于孟买土兵第五步兵团的”（威尔逊：“常胜军”，页一五二）。
    同年10月7日在杭州同余杭之间十里长街的一次战斗中，清军同法国势力的联合自称“毙‘贼’多名，并枪毙‘贼’中黑夷一名”（“左文襄公奏稿”初编，卷十一，页五）。
    除此以外，还可以找到关于太平军中印度人的其他记载，例如有一个自称为呤唎的英国人，在一部著作中曾记述他与一位“印度伙伴”在1863年10月间从上海去苏州投效太平军的情况（呤唎：“太平天国”，第二册，页六三二—六三六）。在同书的另一处，还说到1865年初曾有一个“英属东印度人”随白齐文等潜往漳州，打算加入福建的太平军（页八○○）。又如姚济的“小沧桑记”一书记载，1863年8月11日，曾有太平军中的印度人在松江附近被俘。
    这些投效太平军的印度人是一百年前开拓中印人民友谊道路的先驱，奠立了两国人民共同反对殖民主义的初基。在他们同中国革命者并肩进行的战斗中，体现着两国人民争取民族解放的共同利益，他们不愧为1857年起义的英雄们的直接继承者，是这些英雄们的不朽精神的发扬者。在追念印度大起义的时候，我们对这些参加了太平天国革命的印度人也寄予深深的敬意。
    百年以前中印人民在民族解放运动中相互关怀、相互支援的珍贵历史，证明两国人民反殖民主义的利益很早就是一致的，他们的命运是血肉相关的。现在，一世纪过去了，帝国主义的势力已从我们两国的国土上被驱逐出去，两国人民已经争得了各自的独立。今天，在保卫世界和平、制止帝国主义发动新战争的共同目标下，中国人民和印度人民正以五项原则为指南，进行着更广泛、更密切的合作，在平坦的友谊道路上迈步前进。
