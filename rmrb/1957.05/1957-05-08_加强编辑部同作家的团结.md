Strengthen the Unity Between Editorial Department and Writers

The Secretariat of the Chinese Writers Association held a symposium on the work of editors of Beijing literary periodicals on April 30th and May 6th to discuss how to improve the relationship between the editorial departments of literary publications and writers. It also discussed the revision of Wang Meng's novel "The Young Man Who Arrived at the Organization Department" by the "People's Literature" editorial department. It was unanimously agreed that seriously treating the creative labor of writers and broadly uniting more writers is a key issue in implementing the "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" policy in the literary field. Starting today, we will successively publish the records of this symposium, as well as Wang Meng's article "On 'The Young Man Who Arrived at the Organization Department'" and an article on the "People's Literature" editorial department's revision of the novel's original manuscript.

Editorial departments must rely mainly on writers to run publications well; editorial departments serve writers; editorial departments must be modest, meticulous, and respect the labor of writers.
茅盾 [Mao Dun]

Today is the second symposium on editorial work (for a report on the first symposium, see this newspaper on April 22nd—Editor). Today we will discuss the relationship between writers and editorial departments, that is, strengthening the unity between editorial departments and writers.

Writers and the editorial departments of publications are two main components of a common undertaking. Editorial departments must rely mainly on writers to run publications well; editorial departments serve writers; editorial departments must be modest, meticulous, and respect the labor of writers. In this way, the unity between editorial departments and writers can be strengthened.

The editorial departments of various publications can work hard and strive to do their work well. As a writer, I express my great respect for the hard work of the editorial comrades. However, it must also be admitted that there are contradictions between editorial departments and writers, and there are many contradictions. Dogmatism, sectarianism, and bureaucratism in editorial work are the main causes of contradictions.

Writers have raised many sharp criticisms of editorial work, the two most prominent issues being the selection and modification of manuscripts. Editorial departments must be responsible to both the author and the reader. Therefore, editorial departments must select and modify submissions. Regarding the selection of manuscripts, the work needs to be done well by firmly implementing the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend." I believe that, apart from works of low quality (including formulaic and conceptualized works), and dogmatic theories and critical articles that "kill with one blow," all should be "released" and allowed to "contend." Regarding the modification of manuscripts, the issue is more complex and needs to be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. Some say "not a single word or sentence should be changed," others say "it can be changed." In my opinion, the editorial department can only change typos and obviously incomprehensible sentences, but should not lightly modify the content of the original work. Modifications to the content, even if only one or two sentences, should be subject to the original author's consent. For example, the modification of "The Young Man Who Arrived at the Organization Department," which affected the characters of the original work without the consent of the original author, Comrade Wang Meng, was wrong.

Today's symposium hopes that comrades from the editorial departments will thoroughly express their opinions on the experiences (successful and unsuccessful) and problems in their work, in order to improve the work and enable writers and editorial departments to unite better and run publications well together. Now, I invite the comrades to speak.

Old writers rarely publish articles because they still lack sufficient care and encouragement, and their enthusiasm for creation cannot be boosted.
臧克家 [Zang Kejia]

Good relations between the editorial department and writers are the main condition for running a publication well. However, the relationship between many of our magazines and writers is not very good, and in some cases, it is very bad. Based on what I have heard in relevant meetings, what friends have revealed in conversations, and my own personal feelings, writers are generally dissatisfied with our publication editorial departments for the following reasons:

First, there is insufficient respect for the creative labor of writers. This is most prominent in the modification of writers' manuscripts (especially those of older writers). An old writer who teaches at a university wrote an eight-thousand-word article discussing classical masterpieces, which was published by our editorial department after being cut down to two thousand words. The author angrily exclaimed at a conference: "How can I write articles in the future!" An old poet had a short poem published in our publication, but after it was published, he found that his most satisfying sentence had been changed, making him laugh and cry, and he wrote a letter of protest. Generally, young editors change articles by older writers, removing a "的" [de, a structural particle] and adding a "了" [le, a particle indicating a completed action], thinking they are making it more "grammatical" and smoother, but in reality, they are destroying the style of a writer.

Then there are the issues of soliciting manuscripts, transferring manuscripts, and rejecting manuscripts. Many writers have expressed great dissatisfaction with our publications in these three areas. Some say, "Your solicitation of manuscripts is seasonal. 'March 8th' requires articles about women; 'June 1st' is 'Children's Literature'... Every festival arrives with a bustling crowd at your door, but once the season is over, the entrance is deserted." Some say: "You always come up with 'topics' and ask us to write articles, which puts us in a passive position. I don't want you to 'solicit manuscripts' like this; I prefer to write my own稿and submit it, which is more proactive." Our publication editorial department certainly has this kind of phenomenon when soliciting manuscripts. Some publications go out to solicit articles for a certain commemoration or purpose, explain their intentions, and then offer "a few suggestions" for "reference," which in reality is asking the writer to "fill in" according to this framework. Publications originally plan to use three articles, but fearing that they may not be able to secure all of them, they solicit twice as many manuscripts. Once all the manuscripts are in hand, they take the initiative to choose and select, keeping what they consider good and transferring the others elsewhere, sometimes with the author's consent (do you think they can be happy?), and sometimes without seeking their opinion, transferring them to other publications for publication. The author is in a passive position, their self-esteem is damaged, and their dissatisfaction is conceivable.

I think that our publication editorial department is only concerned with its own convenience and is unwilling to consider the author's perspective. When soliciting manuscripts, they urge and urge, but when the manuscript is not used, they delay the return or casually dispose of it (transfer it elsewhere), which are all ways of offending writers.

Our publication editorial department always hopes to make writers' submissions more "correct" according to its own views. As a result, many articles are published in a very different form from the original (Wang Meng's novel is just one typical example), not only is the author's style damaged, but the writer's thoughts and opinions cannot be truly expressed. Our publication has always been half-closed, with a big attitude, disrespecting or not respecting older writers enough. They are critical of their manuscripts and offer little encouragement and care. There are many older writers who have not had articles published in the seven or eight years since liberation. Are they really unwilling or unable to write? Without the power of encouragement, the enthusiasm for creation cannot be boosted.

The above problems are all old problems, but they have been discussed again and again without being well resolved. After the policy of "Let a hundred schools of thought contend" was proposed, the responsibility of our publication's editorial department has become even greater, and we must unite with writers to run the publication well.

How to improve the relationship between the publication editorial department and writers?

I think we should befriend writers and understand their creative situation. In the past, soliciting manuscripts mostly relied on "official letters," and editorial comrades would also run around to some extent. However, the editor-in-chief, deputy editor-in-chief, and editorial board members mostly sat in the office. I think this situation should be changed. The key leaders of the publication should set aside some time to talk with writers (especially with older writers and writers who have not written for a long time) to understand their creative plans, which is beneficial to both writers and publications.

Adopt the "responsibility for the text rests with the author" method for the manuscripts of older writers, and never make changes (except for typos). This is a maxim, but in the past, it was only posted on the right side for viewing.

Contact writers of various schools of thought, mobilize writers who have not written for many years, encourage them to write, and publish their works in their original form. Make them feel that our publication is not sectarian but is a garden for writers themselves. Once this atmosphere is created, some writers who have concerns will dare to truly express themselves.

When soliciting manuscripts, do not give writers "topics" and ask them to write articles according to the editorial department's "suggestions." Let writers write what they want to write, and write in their own way.

For manuscripts that are too low in quality and really cannot be used, it is best to return them in a timely manner, without hesitating or delaying. There are not many listed articles above, if they are implemented in earnest, the relationship between our publication and the writers will be good. Our publication will also be more vibrant and truly become a large garden of "Let a hundred schools of thought contend."

We should fully respect the author's labor and should not make careless or harmful modifications to the original manuscript.
秦兆阳 [Qin Zhaoyang]

The editorial departments of literary publications and writers originally have a mutually dependent relationship, but there are also mutually contradictory situations. If the relationship between the editorial department and some writers is not good, the editorial department is often more responsible, because this often reflects some shortcomings in the work of the editorial department. And the shortcomings in editorial work are more often manifested in the handling of submissions. Either rejecting manuscripts that should not be rejected, or accumulating manuscripts for too long, or the way of rejecting manuscripts is too simple and blunt, or after rejecting manuscripts, there is no further work to unite them, especially showing insufficient respect for older writers. In addition to this, the modification of manuscripts is also often one of the main reasons why writers have opinions.

I personally have all the above shortcomings in my work. But because of time constraints, I only want to talk about some situations, shortcomings, and errors in the problem of modifying manuscripts in my long-term editorial work, as my personal lessons and for everyone's reference.

From the founding of "People's Literature" in 1949 to the end of 1952, I worked in "People's Literature." At first, I was not willing to modify manuscripts, but soon I started to modify them. During this period of nearly three and a half years, most of the novels, essays, and features published in "People's Literature" were modified by me to varying degrees. Why did I modify the manuscripts? Looking back, there are the following reasons:

First, at that time, the policy of "People's Literature" was to publish exemplary works, guiding theories, and establish a good writing style. Originally, a relatively large publication like this should represent the level of literary creation in our country, and it should be required to be higher. However, what was the actual situation? Due to the early days of liberation, there were fewer manuscripts from older writers, and fewer excellent new writers also appeared, so there were many submissions, but very few were usable, and the publication was often in danger of not being published. At that time, because we had few people, we were busy reading and returning manuscripts, especially because we did not have the experience and habit of organizing manuscripts (basically the style of running publications in the base area era); therefore, we had to mainly rely on submissions to solve the problem. And the absolute majority of submissions were works by amateur authors, which were immature in all aspects. Therefore, for those manuscripts that had a certain foundation but had shortcomings, we would give opinions and send them back to the authors for modification, but in the end, the editors often had to modify them. And in many cases, waiting to send them to the editor-in-chief for review and publication, it was too late to send them back to the author for modification, so we had to do it ourselves (otherwise the publication would not be published).

Second, during this period of three and a half years, "People's Literature" was criticized by newspapers and magazines many times for publishing some works with shortcomings and errors, and made public self-criticisms many times. In addition, there were often accusations from above, below, and from all sides, which formed an extremely unfavorable situation for the publication. The more unfavorable the situation, the higher the enthusiasm for "restoring influence" in the work. Therefore, for those manuscripts that could be used but had shortcomings in content, if the publication time was tight, we would help him make up for it, delete and change it, so that the publication would make fewer mistakes; for those works with a better foundation but not complete, we would modify it to make it more complete and better - to improve the quality of the publication (of course, the view of "quality" inevitably has subjective prejudice).

Third, I personally did not want some works with incomprehensible words, chaotic punctuation, and messy and procrastinating content to appear in such a publication. And many young authors and amateur authors are most likely to make these mistakes (at that time, I did not modify the manuscripts of older writers). In addition, I personally also had the enthusiasm to help young writers publish their works. But I ignored the negative effects on the other hand.

Was it hard to modify the manuscripts like this? It cannot be said that it was not hard. I stayed up several nights, endured dizziness, and aggravated my stomach problems. Were there any achievements? Of course, there were also achievements. The publication was finally published on time, the publication was cleaner in terms of words, and the good works of some new authors were welcomed. Were there any shortcomings? Yes, many. It is inevitable that there were inappropriate modifications, showing insufficient respect for the author, forming an unnatural situation in which the published works did not match the original state, making individual authors develop the habit of not paying attention to the processing of words and artistic processing in writing, etc. But at that time, I did not consider these shortcomings, but thought that I had done work and felt at ease. Even some comrades and leaders around me regarded my working method as an advantage. Therefore, I did not learn a lesson from this period of work.

From January 1956, I worked in "People's Literature" again. I found that in the three years that I had been away, the practice of modifying manuscripts had been continuing. Some of the original situations still existed, such as: the objective environment's requirements for the quality and writing level of the publication; fewer usable submissions and fewer good works (although the manuscript organization activities were greatly strengthened compared to the past, but because the publication's size increased and there were more literary publications in the country, it was still impossible to store a month's manuscripts, and sometimes there was still a danger of not being able to compile them); the manuscripts of new authors still accounted for the majority; fearing that the works had content errors; always hoping that the published articles would be more concise; and so on. We also paid attention to letting the authors modify themselves as much as possible, or obtaining the author's consent before making modifications, for example, finding the author or inviting the author to the editorial department to talk about opinions; if the road was far, the editorial department would pay for the author's travel expenses to live in the editorial department for modification; if the time was too short, we would obtain the author's consent by long-distance telephone before making modifications. However, due to the above-mentioned reasons, we still inevitably had to modify it ourselves, and sometimes told the author after the modification, and sometimes did not tell.

Before the opening of the youth author conference at the beginning of last year, I had raised the issue of manuscript modification at a meeting of the Writers Association, and I usually talked to some leading comrades about the burden that manuscript modification added to the work, but perhaps because I did not raise it from the perspective of respecting the author's labor and other adverse consequences, it did not attract attention. Later, due to being busy, rushing time, my own low level, especially the lack of due understanding of the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," I did not re-seriously consider the issue of manuscript modification. In addition to the increasingly formed confidence and complacency in modifying manuscripts, I finally made a mistake in the issue of modifying manuscripts.

This mistake is prominently manifested in the modification of Comrade Wang Meng's "The Young Man Who Arrived at the Organization Department." Because this work has caused a lot of controversy, I must briefly explain the modification process and the main shortcomings and errors in the modification.

We received this manuscript in mid-June. After reading it, the comrades in the novel group put forward some opinions and handed it to me. After reading it, I talked to the comrades in the group about some opinions. Later, the novel group invited Comrade Wang Meng to talk once. After returning, he made major modifications and re-sent it. On July 17th, the last batch of manuscripts for the August issue was to be published the next day, and it happened that an author temporarily withdrew a 40,000-word manuscript that was to be published, so it was decided to publish Comrade Wang Meng's manuscript. So I rushed to modify it overnight. Due to rushing time, especially due to my own low ideological level, the lack of understanding of the shortcomings of the novel, and the failure to understand the author's intention in some descriptions (even the problems that I had seen in the first draft were ignored this time), I made some inappropriate modifications - mainly the modification of the ending: First, at the end of the original work, Lin Zhen had some awareness, thinking that it was impossible to rely on personal strength in such an environment full of contradictions and struggles, this paragraph was deleted; second, the original work did not clearly distinguish whether the district committee secretary was good or bad, and the ending pointed out that he had sent a correspondent to find Lin Zhen three times (Zhao Huiwen had said earlier that the district committee secretary was a "respectable comrade"), because these sentences were deleted, the district committee secretary may give people the impression of a bureaucrat. This obviously damaged the image of Lin Zhen and the district committee secretary, as well as the author's original intention, thus aggravating the shortcomings of the work. In addition, at that time, considering that Lin Zhen showed a vague feeling for Zhao Huiwen and was rejected, the author and Lin Zhen did not express anything about it, and Lin Zhen's heart was not fluctuating at all, which was somewhat unreasonable (even seeming a little frivolous), so a small paragraph was added. Regardless of whether such an idea was right or wrong at the time, it was inappropriate to replace the author to make such modifications. Moreover, because the previous two more important contents were deleted, the spiritual mood of the ending changed, damaging the original work.

After the novel was published, the editorial department received a letter from Comrade Wang Meng, putting forward technical opinions on the modification and misprinting of individual words and sentences. The novel group did not give this letter to me to read, but sent it to the secretary group, preparing to publish a correction in the publication. Later, due to the negligence of the secretary group, this letter was lost and was never published. I never knew about this.

All these situations were mostly clarified after the problem was discovered, checking the original manuscript, and recalling the process at that time with the comrades of the editorial department.

After the novel caused discussion, because I did not remember deleting the above-mentioned important plot and other modifications; and, as mentioned earlier, I was very confident in the manuscripts I modified; and, in addition, I was busy with work, and I did not read many critical articles; I had not thought of checking the original manuscript. In the later stage of the novel's discussion, once, Comrade Wang Meng came to me to talk about other things, and mentioned that he had some opinions on the modification of the ending of the novel (he was very polite at the time and did not point out the specific content). Due to the above reasons, I was still confident that I had modified it correctly (actually I only remembered the paragraph that I had added at the back), and I simply explained it to him without causing due attention.

This shows that in my long-term work of modifying manuscripts, I unknowingly developed a serious style of disrespecting writers and a proud and complacent mood. This is a major mistake. This mistake is manifested in the fact that, on the one hand, the original manuscript was roughly and harmfully modified, on the other hand, Comrade Wang Meng was not told after the modification, and on the other hand, this problem was not promptly faced after the novel caused discussion, and this problem was not discovered, and a public statement was not made to share Comrade Wang Meng's responsibility.

The mistake of modifying Comrade Wang Meng's manuscript is just a prominent mistake. As for the shortcomings and errors in modifying the manuscripts of other comrades, as well as other problems in work, there are of course many, which will not be discussed here.

I think that the problem of modifying manuscripts probably exists in all editorial departments. I propose that we implement "responsibility for the text rests with the author" for manuscripts in the future. Except for asking the author to modify it himself, the editor will not make any modifications. I think that only in this way can we fully respect the author's labor and conform to the spirit of the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend."

    加强编辑部同作家的团结
    4月30日、5月6日中国作家协会书记处召开了北京文学期刊编辑工作座谈会，讨论怎样改进文学刊物编辑部和作家之间的关系问题，并且讨论了“人民文学”编辑部对王蒙的小说“组织部新来的青年人”原稿的修改问题，一致认为严肃对待作家的创作劳动，广泛地团结更多的作家，是在文学领域内贯彻“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针的关键性的问题。从今天起，我们陆续发表这次座谈会的纪录，以及王蒙“关于‘组织部新来的青年人’”一文和“人民文学”编辑部修改小说原稿的情况一文。
    编辑部要办好刊物，主要是依靠作家；编辑部是为作家服务的，编辑部要虚心，细心，要尊重作家的劳动。
    茅盾
    今天是第二次的编辑工作座谈会（关于第一次座谈会的报道见4月22日本报——编者）。今天要讨论作家和编辑部的关系问题，亦就是编辑部和作家之间加强团结的问题。
    作家和刊物的编辑部是共同事业的两个主要组成部分。编辑部要办好刊物，主要是要依靠作家；编辑部是为作家服务的，编辑部要虚心，细心，要尊重作家的劳动。这样，才能够加强编辑部和作家之间的团结。
    各刊物编辑部都能任劳任怨，努力想把工作做好。作为一个作家，我对于编辑部同志们的辛勤劳动，表示极大的敬意。但是，也应当承认，编辑部和作家们有矛盾，而且有很多矛盾。编辑工作上的教条主义、宗派主义和官僚主义，就是造成矛盾的主要原因。
    作家们对于编辑工作提出了不少尖锐的批评，其中最为突出的两个问题是：稿件的取舍和稿件的修改，编辑部既要对作者负责，也要对读者负责。因此，编辑部对于来稿不能不选择和修改。对于稿件的取舍，需要在坚决贯彻“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针中把工作做好，我以为，除了水平低的作品（公式化、概念化的作品也算在内），教条主义的“一棍子打死”的理论和批评文章而外都应当给它“放”出来，“鸣”起来。对于稿件的修改，问题比较复杂，需要看具体情况，分别处理。有人说“一定不能改动一字一句”，有人说“可以改”；在我看来，编辑部可以改的，只能是别字和显然不通的文句，而不可以轻率修改的，是原作的内容。内容的修改，即使只是一句两句，也应当征求原作者的同意。例如，对于“组织部新来的青年人”的修改，牵动到原作的人物形象而没有征求原作者王蒙同志的同意，是不对的。
    今天的座谈会，就希望各编辑部的同志们就工作中的经验（成功的经验和失败的经验）和问题，透彻地发表意见，以便改进工作，使得作家和编辑部更好地团结起来，共同把刊物办好。现在就请同志们发言。
    老作家很少发表文章，是因为对他们还缺乏足够的关心和鼓励，创作的劲头就鼓不起来。
    臧克家
    编辑部和作家搞好关系，这是办好刊物的主要条件，可是，我们的许多杂志和作家的关系都没有搞得很好，有的甚而搞得很不好。凭我个人在有关会议上听到的、朋友之间交谈时透露出来的，以及个人的一些感受，综合起来，作家对我们刊物编辑部不满意，大概由以下几点原因构成：
    首先是对作家的创作劳动不够尊重。在修改作家稿子（特别是老作家）这一点上表现得最突出。有一位在大学里教书的老作家，写了一篇八千字的谈古典名著的文章，被我们编辑部删削得剩了两千字登了出来，作者在一个会议上气愤地大叫道：“以后叫人家怎么写文章！”一位老诗人，在我们的刊物上发表了一首小诗，发表出来之后，他认为最得意的句子却变了样，弄得他啼笑皆非，写信提抗议。一般年轻的编辑同志，给老作家改文章，去一个“的”字，添一个“了”字，自以为更合“文法”些，更通顺些，实际上是把一个作家的风格破坏了。
    再就是拉稿、转稿、退稿问题，许多作家对我们刊物的这三方面，表示很大的不满。有的说“你们拉稿是有季节性的，‘三八’是要有关妇女的；‘六一’是‘儿童文学’……；每个节令到来的时候，真是门庭若市，热闹非常，而季节一过则门前冷落车马稀了。”有的说：“你们老是出了‘题目’，叫我们做文章，我们处处被动。我不希望你们这样来‘拉稿’，倒喜欢自己写了稿子投了去，那样主动些。”我们刊物编辑部拉稿，确有这种现象。有的刊物，为了一个什么纪念、什么目的出去约文章，把来意说明，然后提出“几点意见”供“参考”，实际上就是叫作家照这样的框子去“填”。刊物本来预计用三篇文章，怕约的文章不一定全有把握，便加倍约稿，一旦稿子全数到手，则主动在我，七选八择，把自己认为好的留下，其他的转给他处，有的经过作者同意（你想他能痛快吗？），有的并没有征求意见，便转给别处发表了。作者处于被动地位，自尊心受到损害，心里的不满，可想而知了。
    我觉得，我们刊物编辑部，只为自己便利不大肯替作者设想，拉稿时，三请五催，稿子不用时，迟迟不退，或随便置处（转别处），这都是开罪作家之处。
    我们刊物编辑部对作家来稿，总希望按自己的看法把它弄得更“正确”些。结果，许多文章刊出来的样子和原稿已大不相同（王蒙的小说不过是典型例子之一），不但作者的风格受到损害，作家的思想、见解也不能真正的表达出来。我们的刊物，过去一直是半掩着门，派头大，对老作家不尊重，或不够尊重。对他们的稿子挑剔多，鼓舞和关心少。有不少老作家，解放后这七八年来，还没见到过他们发表文章。难道他们真的不想写、不能写了？没有鼓舞催生的力量，创作的劲头就鼓不起来。
    上面这些问题，都是老问题，但这些问题，谈了又谈，一直没有得到很好的解决。“百家争鸣、百花齐放”的方针提出以后，我们刊物的编辑部，责任更加重了，更要好好团结作家把刊物办好。
    怎样搞好刊物编辑部和作家的关系？
    我觉得，应该和作家交朋友，了解他们的创作情况。过去拉稿子，多半凭“公函”，编辑同志也各处跑跑。而主编、副主编、编委，大半坐在办公室里。我认为这种情况应该改变一下。刊物的重要负责人，应该腾出一部分时间去和作家们谈谈（特别对一般老作家和久不提笔的作家），了解一下他们的创作计划，这对作家和刊物都有好处。
    对老作家的稿子，采取“文责自负”的办法，决不改动（笔误除外）。这是一句箴言，但过去只是贴在座右备看。
    联系各种流派的作家，发动多年不动笔的作家，鼓舞他们写，按照他们作品的原样刊登出来。使他们感觉到我们的刊物不是宗派的，而是作家们自己的园地。这样的风气一开，某些有顾虑的作家，才敢才会真实地表现自家。
    约稿，不要给作家出“题目”，叫人家按编辑部的“几点意见”作文章。让作家写自己愿意写的，按照自己的方式去写。
    对于水平太低，实在不能用的稿子，顶好能及时退还，不要半推半就，迁延时间。上面列举的条文并不多，如果切实的办到了，我们刊物和作家的关系会弄得好的。我们的刊物也会办得更有生气，真正成为“百家争鸣、百花齐放”的大花园。
    应当充分地尊重作者的劳动，不应对作品原稿作粗率的、有害的修改。
    秦兆阳
    文学刊物的编辑部和作家本来是有着相互依靠的关系，但也有着相互矛盾的情况。编辑部跟某些作家的关系搞得不好，常常是编辑部应该负更多的责任，因为这常常是反映了编辑部工作上有些缺点。而编辑工作上的缺点，更多地是表现在对于来稿的处理上。或者是退了不应该退的稿子，或者是把稿件积压得时间太长，或者是退稿时方式过于简单生硬，或者是退稿以后没有再去作一些善后的团结工作，尤其是对于老作家表现了不够尊重。除此以外，对于稿件的修改，也常常是作家们有意见的重要原因之一。
    所有上述这些缺点，我个人在工作中都是有的。但因为时间关系，我只想就我个人在长期的编辑工作当中，在修改稿子的问题上，谈一些情况、缺点和错误，以作为我个人的教训，并供大家参考。
    在1949年“人民文学”创刊以来，到1952年底，我在“人民文学”工作。刚开始时我并不愿意修改稿子，但不久就开始修改了。在这将近三年半的期间中，“人民文学”上所发表的小说、散文、特写，大部分都经我作了或多或少的修改。我为什么要修改稿子呢？回想起来，有以下的一些原因：
    第一，当时“人民文学”的方针是，发表示范性的作品，指导性的理论，并且要树立良好的文风。本来，像这样一个比较大的刊物，它应该代表我国文学创作的水平，对它要求得高一些是应该的。但是，实际情况怎么样呢？由于是解放初期，老作家的稿子比较少，较优秀的新作家也出现得不多，所以来稿很多，可用的很少，刊物经常有出不来的危险。当时我们因为人手少，看稿退稿忙，尤其是没有进行组稿活动的经验和习惯（基本上是根据地时代办刊物的作风）；因此只好主要依靠来稿来解决问题。而来稿的绝对多数都是业余作者的作品，在各方面都是不成熟的。于是，对那些有一定基础，但有缺点的稿子，就提意见寄回请作者修改，但最后常常还是要由编者来给他修改。而不少的情况是，等着送主编审阅和发稿，寄回作者修改已来不及，就自己动手来帮他修改了（否则刊物就出不来）。
    第二，在这三年半的期间中，“人民文学”因为发表了一些有缺点有错误的作品，多次受到报刊的批评，多次作了公开的检讨。再加上经常来自上面下面和左右前后的责备，就形成了对于刊物的极其不利的形势。形势愈不利，工作上“挽回影响”的劲头反而愈高。于是，对那些可以用但内容上有缺点的稿子，如果发稿时间紧迫，就帮他弥补、删改，使刊物少出错误；对那些基础较好但不完整的作品，就把它修改得完整一些好一些——以提高刊物的质量（对“质量”的看法，当然免不了有主观偏见的成分）。
    第三，自己主观上也不愿意在这样的刊物上出现一些文字不通、标点错乱、内容杂乱拖沓的作品。而不少青年作者和业余作者又最容易犯这些毛病（当时对老作家的稿子我是不修改的）。此外，自己主观上也有着帮助青年作家发表作品的热情。但是却忽略了另外一方面的不好的效果。
    像这样去修改稿子辛苦不辛苦呢？不能说不辛苦。熬了若干个夜，忍受着头晕，加重了胃病。有没有成绩呢？当然也不无成绩。刊物总算按期出版了，刊物在文字上比较干净了，一些新作者的好作品受到欢迎了。有没有缺点呢？有，很多。难免有不妥当的修改，对作者表现了不够尊重，形成了发表出来的作品和原来的状态不相符合的不自然的情况，使得个别作者养成了在写作上不注意文字加工和艺术加工的习惯，等等。但是当时我并没有考虑到这些缺点，反倒以为自己作了工作而心安理得。甚至，我周围的一些同志和领导上也把我的这种工作方式看成是优点。因此，我并没有从这一时期的工作中接受到教训。
    从1956年1月开始，我又在“人民文学”工作了。我发现，在我离开了的这三年中，改稿的作法一直在继续着。原来过去的某些情况仍然存在，例如：客观环境对于刊物的质量和文字水平的要求；来稿可用者少，好作品更少（虽然组稿活动比过去大大加强了，但因刊物篇幅增多了，全国文学刊物多了，所以仍然不能做到存下一个月的稿子，有时仍有编不出来的危险）；新作者的稿子仍占多数；怕作品有内容上的错误；总希望发表出去的文章精练一些；等等。我们也注意到尽可能让作者自己修改，或取得作者同意后再进行修改，例如，找作者去或请作者到编辑部来面谈意见；路远者由编辑部出旅费请作者来住在编辑部修改；如时间来不及，则通长途电话取得作者同意后再行修改。但是，由于上述的种种原因，仍然免不了要自己动手替作者修改，改了后有的告诉了作者，有的就没有告诉。
    去年年初开青年作者会议之前，我曾在作家协会的一次会议上提出过改稿问题，平常也跟一些领导同志谈到过修改稿子给工作所增加的负担，但也许是因为没有从尊重作家的劳动的角度及其他不良后果去提，因而没有引起注意。以后，由于忙，赶时间，自己的水平低，特别是对“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针缺乏应有的认识，对改稿问题未重新作认真的考虑。再加上日益形成的对于修改稿子的自信心和自满情绪，于是，终于在改稿的问题上出了毛病。
    这毛病突出地表现在对于王蒙同志的“组织部新来的青年人”的修改上。由于这篇作品曾经引起了较大的争论，所以我必须把修改的过程和修改中主要的缺点和错误简略地说明一下。
    我们是6月中旬收到这篇稿子的。小说组里看了后，提了些意见，交给我。我看过后对组里的同志谈了些意见，以后小说组请王蒙同志来谈了一次，回去以后他作了较大的修改，又重新寄来。7月17日，第二天就要发8月号的最后一批稿子了，恰巧有一位作者临时抽走了一篇待发的四万字的稿子，就决定发王蒙同志的这篇。于是连夜赶着修改。由于赶时间，特别是由于自己思想水平低，对于小说的缺点缺乏认识，对于作者某些描写的用意没有领会（甚至连在第一次稿上看出了的问题这次也忽略了），就作了一些不妥当的修改——主要是结尾处的修改：第一是原作结尾时林震多少有些觉悟，想到在这样充满了矛盾斗争的环境里凭个人的力量是不行的，这段文字被删去了；第二是原作并未明确区委书记是好是坏，结尾处曾点出他派通讯员找过林震三次（在前面赵慧文曾说过区委书记是个“可尊敬的同志”），由于把这几句话删去了，区委书记就可能给人以官僚主义者的印象了。这显然是对林震和区委书记的形象，以及对作者的原意有所损害，因而加重了作品的缺点。另外，当时由于考虑到林震对赵慧文表现了朦胧的感情而被拒绝以后，作者和林震对此都无表示，林震心里竟是无所波动，未免显得不合理（甚至会显得他有些轻佻），所以就给加了一小段。不管当时这样的想法对不对，代替作者来作这样的修改总是不妥当的。而且，由于删去了前面那两条较为重要的内容，就使得结尾处的精神情调起了变化，对原作有了损害。
    小说发表以后，编辑部曾收到王蒙同志的来信，对其中个别字句的修改和误排提出了技术性的意见，小说组没有把这信交给我看，就送秘书组，准备在刊物上登一更正，后来由于秘书组工作上的疏忽，这封信丢了，终于没有登出更正来，这事我一直不知道。
    所有这些情形，大都是在问题发现以后，查对原稿，并与编辑部的同志们共同回忆当时的过程，才弄清楚了的。
    在小说引起了讨论以后，我因为并不记得删掉了上述那样重要的情节及其他某些修改；并且，像前面所说的，对自己所修改的稿子非常自信；再加上工作忙，有很多批评文章我都没有看；就一直没有想到要去查对一下原稿。在小说讨论的后期，有一次，王蒙同志来找我谈别的事情，顺便提到他对小说结尾处的修改有点意见（当时他很客气，并未指出具体内容），由于上述原因，我还自信自己改得对（实际上我只记得后边给加添的那一段），对他简单解释了一下，并没有引起应有的注意。
    这说明了我在长期的改稿工作中，不知不觉地养成了一种严重的不尊重作家的作风和骄傲自满的情绪。这是一个重大的错误，这错误一方面表现在对原稿作了粗率的、有害的修改，一方面表现在改过以后未告诉王蒙同志，再一方面表现在小说引起讨论以后没有及时地正视这一问题，发现这一问题，作出公开的声明，以分担王蒙同志的责任。
    修改王蒙同志的稿子的错误，不过是一个突出的错误，至于修改其他同志的稿子的缺点和错误，以及工作中其他方面的问题，当然还很多，这里不谈。
    我想，各个编辑部恐怕都存在着修改稿子的问题。我提议我们以后对稿件实行“文责自负”，除请作者自己修改外，编者一律不作修改。我以为只有这样才能充分地尊重作者的劳动，才符合于“百花齐放、百家争鸣”方针的精神。
