Taming Rivers, Transforming Oceans, Developing Grasslands
The Soviet People's Grand Plans for Conquering Nature

    This newspaper reports that many of the large rivers in the Soviet Union flow into the Arctic Ocean, discharging vast amounts of water there. If these rivers could be made to flow in reverse, changing their direction from north to south, it would greatly benefit electricity production and the irrigation of arid lands. Soviet engineers are now formulating a plan to reverse the flow of the Pechora and Vychegda rivers, diverting them into the Kama and Volga rivers. Once this plan is realized, the hydroelectric power stations on the Kama and Volga rivers will be able to produce approximately 10 billion more kilowatt-hours of electricity without adding equipment.

    The plan involves constructing high dams and reservoirs on the Pechora and Vychegda rivers to block the northward flow of water, and building a large hydraulic hub with a reservoir on the Kama River. Then, canals will be used to connect the reservoirs on these three rivers, so that the water intercepted from the Pechora and Vychegda rivers will flow into the Kama River through the canals. The design work for these construction projects is expected to be completed by the end of 1960, and construction is scheduled to begin in the next Five-Year Plan.

    In addition to increasing electricity generation, the southward flow of these two rivers will also stabilize the water level of the Caspian Sea. This is also of great significance for the development of the Soviet national economy.

    The Caspian Sea is the world's largest inland sea, possessing extremely rich resources. Before the Great Patriotic War of the Soviet Union, its fish production accounted for 40% of the entire Soviet Union, and its oil resources were also very abundant. However, the water level of the Caspian Sea is now decreasing, and it is becoming shallower, especially noticeably in the last two decades. From 1929 to 1956, its water level dropped by 2.5 meters, and the sea surface area shrank by a total of 35,000 square kilometers. In some places, the water surface is already 30 kilometers away from the former coastline. The shallowing situation is more severe in the fish-rich northern part. Under these circumstances, the fish production of the Caspian Sea has decreased by one-half, causing the national economy to suffer at least 500 million rubles in losses each year. In addition, it has also caused difficulties for shipping and losses to the oil industry.

    Why is the Caspian Sea becoming shallower? The Caspian Sea has no connection to the ocean, and its water volume is closely related to the amount of water flowing into it from various rivers. According to scholars, the main reason for the Caspian Sea becoming shallower is the gradual warming of the climate in the past one or two hundred years.

    We cannot just watch the Caspian Sea gradually become shallower and allow it to bring huge losses to the national economy. Therefore, adjusting the water level of the Caspian Sea is an urgent issue. Soviet scientists are now actively discussing what methods to use to maintain a certain water level for the Caspian Sea. Two plans have already been proposed. One plan is to reverse the flow of the northern rivers of the Soviet Union, first diverting the Pechora and Vychegda rivers southward, so that the water from these two rivers flows into the Volga River, thereby increasing the amount of water flowing into the Caspian Sea. However, this method will not produce results quickly. The other plan is to build a large dam across the Caspian Sea in the northern part, raising the water level of the northern part, which is the most economically important part, to the level of 1930. Two navigation canals will be built on the dam. This method is more economical and can also produce results more quickly. Currently, the Soviet scientific community is conducting further and more meticulous research on this issue.

    In Soviet Central Asia, straddling the Uzbek and Kazakh republics, lies a barren wasteland known as the Hungry Steppe. Last year, the Soviet government decided to reclaim 300,000 hectares of land on the Hungry Steppe between 1956 and 1962, turning the wasteland into cotton fields. Once all 300,000 hectares are developed, they will be able to produce at least 300,000 tons of seed cotton each year.

    Now, thousands of Soviet youths have come to the steppe to participate in development work. The construction of roads, high-voltage transmission lines, residences, public buildings, etc., is proceeding intensively. More than 36,000 square meters of housing have been built. A new city with a population of more than 100,000 is being built in the southern part of the steppe, and it will be the administrative center of the Hungry Steppe. Excavator repair factories, concrete and reinforced concrete component factories, brick factories, etc., have all started construction. More than 50 kilometers of roads have already been built. Although the decision to develop the steppe was announced only a little more than seven months ago.

    The scale and speed of the water conservancy and irrigation projects on the Hungry Steppe are unprecedented in Soviet history. From 1956 to 1962, the total length of the irrigation canal network built here will be 7,000 kilometers. At that time, the Hungry Steppe, which has been ravaged by the scorching sun and dry winds for centuries, will be transformed into the largest cotton field in the Soviet Union. (Image attached)

### 驯服河水　改造海洋　开发草原  苏维埃人征服大自然的雄伟计划

    驯服河水　改造海洋　开发草原
    苏维埃人征服大自然的雄伟计划
    本报讯　苏联有许多大河是注入北冰洋的，它们把大量的水抛到北冰洋去。如果能使这些河流的水倒流，使它们改为从北向南流，就可以大大有利于电力生产和对干旱土地进行引水和灌溉工作。现在苏联的工程师们正在制定一项计划，要使彼乔拉河和维切格达河的水倒流过来，注入卡马河和伏尔加河。这个计划实现后，将使卡马河和伏尔加河上的水电站可以多生产约一百亿度电力，而不必增加设备。
    计划要在彼乔拉河和维切格达河上建筑高水坝和水库，截断北去的河水，在卡马河上要建筑一个带有水库的大水力枢纽。然后用运河把这三条河上的水库连接起来，这样，彼乔拉河和维切格达河被截住的河水就通过运河流到卡马河里来了。这些建筑工程预计在1960年底完成全部设计工作，在下一个五年计划中就要开始建筑了。
    这两条河流的水南流以后，除了可以用来增加发电量以外，还可以使里海的水位稳定。这对苏联国民经济的发展，也有重大的意义。
    里海是世界上最大的内海，它拥有极丰富的资源。在苏联伟大卫国战争以前，它的鱼产量占全苏联40％，石油资源也是非常丰富的。但是，现在里海的水却越来越少，它变得越来越浅了，近二十多年来特别显著。自从1929年到1956年，它的水位降低了二公尺半，海面的面积共缩小了三万五千平方公里，有几个地方，水面距从前的海岸已有三十公里远了。盛产鱼类的北部变浅的情况较厉害。在这种情况下，里海的鱼产量减少了二分之一，国民经济因此每年要至少遭受五亿卢布的损失。此外，也给航运造成困难，也使石油工业受到损失。
    里海为什么会变浅呢？里海同大洋没有联系，它的水量同各河流注入里海的水量多少有最密切的关系。根据学者们的意见，里海变浅的主要原因，是近一二百年来气候逐渐温暖的原故。
    不能这样看着里海逐渐浅下去，不能眼看着它给国民经济带来巨大损失。因此，调整里海的水面问题，就是个迫切问题了。现在苏联科学家们正在积极讨论用什么方法使里海保持一定水位的问题。现在已提出了两个方案。一个方案是使苏联北部河流倒流，首先是使彼乔拉河和维切格达河转向南流，使这两条河的水注入伏尔加河，从而使注入里海的水量增加。不过这个方法不是很快就能见到效果的。另一个方案是用一个大堤把里海在靠北部的地方拦腰截断，把北部的水位，也就是经济意义上最重要的部分的水位，提高到1930年时的水平。大堤上修建两条通航运河。这个方法比较经济一些，也可以较快地看到效果。目前苏联科学界正在就这个问题做进一步的更缜密的研究。
    在苏联的中亚细亚，地跨乌兹别克和哈萨克共和国的地方，有一片不毛的荒原，这就是饥饿草原。去年，苏联政府决定在1956年到1962年间在饥饿草原上开垦三十万公顷土地，把荒原变成棉田。这三十万公顷全部开发后，每年至少能生产三十多万吨籽棉。
    现在，成千的苏联青年已经来到草原参加开发工作。公路、高压输电线、住宅、公共建筑物等的建筑工作，都在紧张地进行中。已建起了三万六千多平方公尺住宅。一座将有十万多人口的新城市已在草原南部兴建，它将是饥饿草原的行政中心。挖掘机修配厂、混凝土钢筋构件厂、造砖厂等都已动工修建。公路已建成了五十多公里。虽然，开发草原的决定自公布至今也才不过七个多月。
    饥饿草原上展开的水利灌溉工程，其规模和速度都是苏联历史上空前的。从1956年到1962年，这里所建成的灌溉渠网总共将有七千公里长。那时，这多少世纪来被烈日和干风蹂躏的饥饿草原，将变成苏联最大的棉田。（附图片）
