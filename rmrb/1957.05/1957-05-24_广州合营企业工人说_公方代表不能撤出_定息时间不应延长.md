Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, May 23rd: The Guangzhou Federation of Trade Unions convened a meeting of workers from some public-private joint ventures on the 21st to discuss the question of whether public representatives should be withdrawn from public-private joint ventures.

　　Liang Zuren, a worker at the Nanfang Jinbi (Golden Pen) Factory, said: Public representatives are representatives of the state in transforming public-private joint ventures. Although public representatives have some shortcomings, it should first be affirmed that the role of public representatives in public-private joint ventures is primary. Our factory was formed by the merger of two private golden pen factories. Before the joint venture, one often suffered losses, and the other often borrowed money to make ends meet due to insufficient capital turnover; after the joint venture, it was also difficult at first, and it looked like it was going to lose money, but with the cooperation of the public representatives and the workers, not only did it not lose money, but it also had a surplus. Therefore, I believe that public-private joint ventures should not only have public representatives, but also strengthen the leading role of the state-owned economy in joint ventures through public representatives.

　　Guo Yu, a representative of the grassroots trade union in the Zhong District catering industry, disagreed with the statement that public representatives do not understand technology. He said: Public representatives are somewhat inferior to capitalists in terms of production technology, but public representatives have a very important technology—the technology of doing mass work. To do a good job, it is necessary to mobilize the masses. Capitalists used to exploit workers, and even now many of them still do not understand the suffering of workers. How can they mobilize the masses of workers? Public representatives are different. Most of them are workers and cadres with prestige. Workers are willing to tell them the truth and are happy to accept their leadership. He went on to say: Some people say that without public representatives in public-private joint ventures, the enthusiasm of capitalists can be better brought into play. I can present facts to show that it only brings into play the enthusiasm of capitalists that is harmful to the national economy and the people's livelihood. For example, in this industry in our district, there have been more than 40 cases of capitalists abusing or withdrawing funds, and these things have all happened in smaller stores without public representatives; "three stoppages" - stoppage of work, stoppage of wages, and stoppage of meals - have also occurred in stores without public representatives.

　　Wu Zhiqin, a female worker at the Wu Yuxing Cloth Factory, said: After the joint venture, under the leadership of the public representatives, our factory not only has good production, but also has greatly improved worker welfare. Before the joint venture, workers paid for their own medical treatment when they got sick, and the capitalists only gave one or five yuan. They didn’t care if they died of illness, and even made sarcastic remarks. Now we all enjoy labor insurance benefits and can receive free medical care when we are sick.

　　Wu Zhiqin also addressed the opinion that fixed interest should be extended to 20 years, saying: I think that seven years of fixed interest is already very long, and the state has taken good care of the capitalists. Take the five private individuals in our factory as an example. Not only do they have fixed interest, but they are also employed as factory directors, section chiefs, workshop directors, and other positions, and some have even arranged jobs for their family members. She said excitedly: There is no socialism if there is exploitation. Extending fixed interest to 20 years is dragging socialism back. This is unwillingness to transform oneself and unwillingness to give up the life of a capitalist.

　　Liang Zuren, a worker at the Nanfang Jinbi Factory, compared the opinion of extending fixed interest for 20 years to the Cantonese saying "a man's heart is never satisfied, like a snake trying to swallow an elephant." He said: Some people have proposed extending the fixed interest because the redemption must be complete, but they have not taken into account the figures for "four horses divide the wealth" and profit sharing before the joint venture, which is unacceptable.

　　He Changquan, a worker at the Quanxin Knitting Factory, said: Extending the fixed interest delays socialism. At that time, we workers will question the state and the Party: Why are we still being exploited by capitalists? We workers will never agree to this request!

### 广州合营企业工人说  公方代表不能撤出  定息时间不应延长

    广州合营企业工人说
    公方代表不能撤出
    定息时间不应延长
    据新华社广州23日电　广州市工会联合会21日召集部分公私合营企业的工人开会，座谈公私合营企业内是否应该撤出公方代表的问题。
    南方金笔厂工人梁祖任说：公方代表是代表国家改造公私合营企业的代表。公方代表虽然有些缺点，但是首先应该肯定公方代表在公私合营企业中起的作用是主要的。我们这家工厂是由两家私营金笔厂合并成的。合营以前，一家时常亏损，一家常常因为资金周转不开，借债过日子；合营以后，初时也很困难，看看要亏本了，但在公方代表和工人合作下不仅没有亏本，而且还有盈余。因此，我认为公私合营企业不但应有公方代表，而且还要通过公方代表加强国营经济对合营企业的领导作用。
    中区饮食业基层工会代表郭煜不同意说公方代表不懂技术的说法。他说：公方代表在生产技术方面是比资本家差些，但公方代表有一套非常重要的技术——搞群众工作的技术。要做好工作必须发动群众。资方人员过去是剥削工人的，到现在他们中不少人还是很不了解工人疾苦，他们怎样能够发动工人群众呢？公方代表就不同了，他们大多数是有威信的工人干部，工人愿意给他们讲真心话，也乐于接受他们的领导。他接着说：有人说公私合营企业里没有公方代表可以更发挥资方人员的积极性，我可以拿出事实说，只是更发挥了资方人员有害于国计民生的积极性。如我们这个区的这个行业里，就发生资方人员滥用或抽走资金的事有四十多宗，这些事都发生在没有公方代表的较小的商店里；“三停”——停工、停发薪水、停止伙食的事也发生在没有公方代表的商店里。
    吴裕兴布厂女工吴志勤说：合营以后在公方代表领导下，我们厂不仅生产搞得好，而且工人福利也有很大改善。合营前工人有了病自己出钱，资本家只给个一元、五角的，病死了也不管，还要说风凉话。现在我们都享受了劳保待遇，有病可以公费医疗。
    吴志勤又针对有人提出定息要延长至二十年的意见说：我认为定息七年已经很长了，国家对资本家是够照顾的了。就拿我们厂的五个私方人员来说，不仅有定息，而且都让他们担任了厂长、股长、车间主任等职位，有些连家属也安排了工作。她很激动地说：有剥削就不成为社会主义，延长定息到二十年是拖社会主义的后腿，这是不愿改造自己、不愿放弃资本家生活。
    南方金笔厂工人梁祖任把延长定息二十年的意见比喻为广东口语“人心不足蛇吞象”。他说：有人提出延长定息的理由是赎买要到底，但是却没有把合营前的“四马分肥”和分红等数字算进去，这是讲不过去的。
    全新针织厂工人何长全说：延长定息就是延迟了社会主义。那时我们工人会向国家和党质问：为什么还让资本家剥削我们？我们工人绝不答应这个要求！
