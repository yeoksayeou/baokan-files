What Do Social Scientists Want?
    ——Notes from the Philosophy and Social Sciences Department Meeting
    By Our Staff Reporter

    What do social scientists want? At the two-day meeting of the Philosophy and Social Sciences Department Committee, the reporter found some answers from the scholars' speeches. These answers are now recorded below for readers who are concerned about the development of social sciences.

      They Need Time

      "Scientists do not fight for power, nor do they have the problem of holding a position without authority; they do not fight for money, nor do they have the problem of extending the fixed interest period; what they want to fight for is time," said historian Jian Bozan, representing the common demand of social scientists.

    Scientists are very troubled by the current situation of excessive social activities. Economist Shen Zhiyuan said that he spent most of his time on social activities last year. Social activities took up almost nine and a half months, plus other administrative work, so he basically had no time for research last year. Many scholars have pointed out that scientists are now being pulled to meetings by various parties. Each unit thinks they only invited them once, but the number of times adds up when all units are combined. To cope with this difficult situation, economist Ma Yinchu said that he came up with a way to ask for leave and go away. Last year, he went to Hangzhou to hide for three months. But this is not a solution to the problem.

    At this meeting, the department members put forward a proposal requesting the academy to take concrete measures to ensure that department members and other senior researchers have sufficient time for scientific research. Many scholars believe that ensuring research time is a social issue, and in addition to the Academy of Sciences paying attention to it, it must also attract the attention of relevant departments.

      Importance of Data Work

    To conduct scientific research, there must be sufficient data. In social sciences, this problem is particularly prominent.

    Many scholars mentioned that there is a large amount of data currently that no one is sorting out and is in a dangerous state. Soviet expert Serdyuchenko said that in the archives of the Liaoning Library, there are 2.3 million files from the Tang and Ming-Qing dynasties and 20,000 files related to Sino-Soviet friendship, piled up there with no one to sort them out. In the Dalian Mantetsu Library, there are tens of thousands of pieces of data on the Japanese invasion of China, which are also unmanaged and can be taken away at will. Linguist Luo Changpei also mentioned that there are a large number of archives in the Forbidden City that have not been well processed. In addition to archival data, many "living data" have not been valued. Historian Du Guoxiang said that in Guangzhou, there are many people who participated in the Sino-French War, the Hong Kong-Guangdong Strike, and the Guangzhou Commune who are still alive. They personally experienced these historical events. If they are not quickly asked to recount the situation at that time and record it, it will cause irreparable losses.

    To sort out the data, it is necessary to organize a group of people. Scholars have pointed out that there is currently a bad trend, which is to regard the work of sorting out data and editing reference books as second-rate work, which is disdained by learned scholars. In this case, whoever is asked to do the work of editing and sorting out data is unwilling to do it. Historian Jian Bozan suggested increasing the treatment of editors and treating them the same as researchers. In addition to valuing data work, scholars also proposed organizing the strength of the Literature and History Museum and unemployed intellectuals to undertake this work.

    Historians feel that there is too much data and no one to sort it out. Economists feel that there is no data. Economist Wu Chengxi said that due to confidentiality reasons, a lot of data is not available to the general public, which has led to the current situation where economists have to "escape reality" or study foreign economies. He believes that the current confidentiality system was established during the past period of acute class struggle. Now that the domestic class struggle has basically ended, it can be considered for revision. In fact, many of our foreign trade statistics are confidential in China, but they are published in foreign economic journals. Speaking of this, he mentioned that the current archival system of many economic institutions is chaotic, many archives are not classified, some institutions do not have dedicated personnel in charge, and there is no date on the archives, so even if they are made public, they cannot be used. He suggested strengthening the management of archival data.

        Improve Publishing

    Many scholars are very dissatisfied with the current publishing system. Du Guoxiang said that the current right to publish books is in the hands of a few people who do not understand scholarship. They blindly pursue profits and are unwilling to publish truly academic works. Historian Lü Zhenyu said that the comrades in the publishing house do not trust the author's level very much and are too responsible, often arbitrarily revising the original manuscript. The publication date of his "History of Chinese Political Thought" was delayed for a long time due to the revision of the preface. And the revision was very bad. For example, Chairman Mao's words were mistakenly changed to his own words.

    Linguist Ding Shengshu criticized the phenomenon of "emphasizing science and neglecting humanities" in publishing work. He said that the Institute of Linguistics has a manuscript of a dialect survey, which was sent to the Science Press and it took a year to produce the proof. This book should have been published last year, but it was squeezed out by natural science books.

    Guarantee Minimum Working Conditions

    To conduct scientific research, certain material conditions are needed. Scientists have a lot of opinions on the allocation of funds and housing in the Academy of Sciences.

    Economist Shen Zhiyuan mentioned the financial difficulties of the Shanghai Economic Research Institute. When the Economic Research Institute was first established, there was no start-up fund, and the money to buy a table had to be reimbursed to the Shanghai Office of the Academy of Sciences. The current equipment cannot be compared with the other six natural science research institutes in Shanghai. Now we sit on hard benches in the office, and there is no place to rest. The dormitory is far from the office, and it takes three hours to go back and forth on the road. He criticized the Shanghai Office's idea of treating the Economic Research Institute as an extra burden, and believed that it should be treated equally with natural sciences and help them financially.

    Historian Hou Wailu vividly and humorously described the difficult material conditions of the Second Institute of Historical Research. He said that to establish a research institute, there must be minimum material conditions. Currently, the space in the Second Institute is not enough, and even the director's office is not available. The Scientific Planning Commission knew about the difficulty of housing in the Academy of Sciences and gave the Department of Philosophy and Social Sciences 8,000 square meters of capital construction funds. However, the Administration Bureau only takes care of the basic construction of the natural science departments, not the philosophy and social sciences department, so they have to manage it themselves. These two days, we are planning to build an office building in the old Ninth Master's Mansion. The municipal government sent a young girl, saying that the old Ninth Master's Mansion is an ancient cultural relic and is not allowed to be demolished and built. In fact, the old Ninth Master's Mansion is only a few hundred years old and is not an ancient cultural relic at all. Finally, he and Comrade Yin Da went to Vice Mayor Zhang Youyu to resolve the issue.

    Maintain an Appropriate Ratio Between Natural Sciences and Social Sciences

    How to maintain an appropriate ratio between the development of natural sciences and social sciences is a contradiction in the current scientific undertaking. Many social scientists have mentioned that there is currently a phenomenon of "emphasizing science and neglecting humanities."

    Scholars believe that the Academy of Sciences' leadership's idea of "emphasizing science and neglecting humanities" is reflected in many aspects. This is not only reflected in the allocation of funds, but also in the documents, which contain ideas that undervalue social sciences. Hou Wailu said that the report of the Academy of Sciences said that in the future, the development of research institutions will adopt the policy of "strengthening key areas and providing corresponding consideration," listing social sciences as being taken care of. He said that the term "take care of" is very unpleasant, only sick people need to be taken care of. Shen Zhiyuan continued, someone mentioned the issue of emphasizing science and neglecting humanities during the propaganda meeting, and Chairman Mao said at that time that the humanities should be given appropriate satisfaction, and he did not say the word "take care of". They all believed that this represented a "emphasizing science and neglecting humanities" ideology on the part of the leadership.

    Science should be valued, which everyone agrees with. Professor Jian Bozan said that China's industry is backward, and science should be valued not only today, but also a hundred years from now. But one cannot neglect the humanities just because one values science. He criticized the phenomenon of grading science in some places. He said that in some places, science is divided into grades: first mathematics, second physics, third biology, fourth chemistry, fifth geography and geology…and finally social sciences. But science can only be classified, not graded. His words were agreed upon by the scholars present.

    In order to correctly resolve the contradiction between science and the humanities, some scholars have suggested stipulating a certain ratio in terms of funding allocation, etc. Some scholars advocate separating the research work of social sciences and natural sciences for leadership, because the specific situations of the two are different. They suggested that the Department of Philosophy and Social Sciences should have greater independence.

    社会科学家们要求些什么？
    ——哲学、社会科学学部会议旁听记
    本报记者
    社会科学家们要求些什么呢？在两天的哲学社会科学学部委员会上，记者从学者们的发言中，找到了一些答案。现在将这些答案记录在下边，供关心社会科学发展的读者们参考吧。
      他们需要时间
      “科学家们一不争权，不发生有职无权的问题；二不争钱，不发生延长定息时间的问题；他们所要争的，就是时间，”历史学家翦伯赞的这一句话，代表了社会科学家的共同要求。
    科学家们对于目前社会活动过多的情况，感到非常头痛。经济学家沈志远说，他去年大部分时间都花到社会活动上去了。社会活动时间差不多占去了九个半月，再加上其他的行政工作，去年基本上没有时间进行研究。好多学者都提出，现在各方面都要拉科学家去开会，每个单位都认为自己只请了一次，各单位加起来次数就多了。为了应付这种难受的局面，经济学家马寅初说，他就想了一个请假外出的办法，去年他到杭州去躲了三个月。可是这总不是一个解决问题的办法。
    在这次会议上，学部委员们就提出了一个提案，请院部采取具体措施，以保证学部委员以及其他高级研究人员有充分进行科学研究的时间。不少学者认为，要保证研究时间，是一个社会性的问题，除了由科学院注意外，还必须引起有关部门的注意。
      重视资料工作
    要进行科学研究，必须要有充分的资料。在社会科学方面，这个问题尤其突出。
    好多位学者提到目前有大量的资料，没有人整理，处在危险的状态中。苏联专家谢尔久琴科说，在辽宁图书馆档案室里，有二百三十万件唐代和明清时代的档案和两万件有关中苏友谊的档案，堆在那里没有人整理。在大连满铁图书馆，有关于日本侵略中国的资料几万件，也无人管理，任人随意拿去。语言学家罗常培也提到故宫有大批档案没有很好处理。除了档案资料外，还有许多“活资料”没有被重视。历史学家杜国庠说，在广州有不少参加过中法战争、省港罢工、广州公社的人，现在还健在。他们亲身经历这些历史事件，如果不赶快请他们叙说当时的情况，纪录下来，将会造成不可弥补的损失。
    要整理资料就需要组织一批人力，学者们提出目前有一种不好的风气，就是把整理资料和编辑工具书的工作，看作二等的工作，是博学之士所不屑为的。在这种情况下，要谁去做编辑和整理资料的工作，谁就不愿干。历史学家翦伯赞建议提高编辑人员的待遇，将他们和研究人员一样看待。除了重视资料工作外，学者们又提出组织文史馆和失业知识分子的力量，来担负这一工作。
    历史学家感到资料太多，无人整理。经济学家则感到没有资料。经济学家吴承禧说，由于保密关系，好多资料一般人看不到，这就造成了目前经济学家只好“逃避现实”，或者研究外国经济。他认为目前的保密制度，还是过去阶级斗争尖锐时期所订的。目前国内阶级斗争基本结束，可以考虑修订。事实上我们有好多国外贸易的统计数字在国内是保密的，而在国外的经济刊物上都发表了。谈到这里，他提到目前好多经济机关档案制度混乱，好多档案没有分类，有些机关没有专人负责，档案上也没有年月日，这样即使公开了也无法利用，他建议加强档案资料的管理工作。
        改善出版事业
    好多学者对目前的出版制度很不满意。杜国庠说，目前的出书权掌握在几个不懂学问的人的手里，他们盲目的追求利润，对真正学术著作不愿意出版。历史学家吕振羽说，出版社的同志不大信任著者水平，又过于负责，往往随便修改原稿。他写的“中国政治思想史”就是为了序言的修改问题，将出版日期拖了好长时期。而且改得很不好。例如：将毛主席的话错改成他自己的话。
    语言学家丁声树批评了出版工作中的“重理轻文”现象。他说语言研究所有一部方言调查的稿子，送给科学出版社，过了一年才排出样来。这部书原来应该在去年就出版，结果被自然科学的书籍挤掉了。
    保证最低限度的工作条件
    要进行科学研究，需要一定的物质条件，科学家们对科学院的经费和房屋分配等很有意见。
    经济学家沈志远提到上海经济研究所经费困难的情况。经济研究所初成立，没有开办费，买一张桌子的钱都要到科学院上海办事处去报销。目前的设备和上海其他六个自然科学研究所不能比。现在办公室坐的是硬板凳，也没有休息的地方。宿舍离办公室很远，路上来回要花三小时。他批评了上海办事处把经济研究所当作额外负担的思想，认为应该和自然科学一视同仁，在经费上帮助他们。
    历史学家侯外庐生动风趣地描述了历史研究第二所物质条件的困难。他说要成立一个研究所，必须有起码的物质条件。目前第二所的地方不够，连所长的办公地方都没有。科学规划委员会知道科学院房子的困难，给了社会科学学部八千平方米的基建费。可是管理局只管自然科学几个学部的基本建设，不管社会科学学部的基本建设，只好自己来管。这两日正要计划在老九爷府修建办公楼，市政府派来一个年轻的女孩子，说老九爷府是古文物，不准拆建。事实上老九爷府不过几百年历史，根本不是古文物。最后他和尹达同志去找了张友渔副市长，才算解决。
    自然科学和社会科学要保持适当的比例
    自然科学和社会科学的发展怎样保持适当的比例，是目前科学事业中的一个矛盾。好多社会科学家都提到目前有“重理轻文”的现象。
    学者们认为，科学院领导上“重理轻文”的思想是表现在多方面的。这不仅表现在经费的分配上，而且还表现在文件上，都有轻视社会科学的思想。侯外庐说，科学院的报告说，今后对研究机构的发展将采取“重点加强、相应照顾”的方针，将社会科学列在被照顾之列。他说照顾这名词很难听，只有病了的人才叫人照顾。沈志远接着说，宣传会议时有人提到重理轻文的问题，毛主席当时说对文科要有适当的满足，也没有说照顾两字。他们都认为这就是代表了领导上的一种“重理轻文”的思想。
    理科应该重视，这是大家同意的。翦伯赞教授说，我国工业落后，理科不但今天应该重视，就是过了一百年也应该重视。可是不能因为重视理科就轻视文科。他批评了某些地方将科学分等的现象。他说现在有些地方将科学分了等级：一数学，二物理，三生物，四化学，五地理地质…………最后才是社会科学。可是科学只能分类不能分等。他的话得到了在座学者的赞同。
    为了正确地解决理科和文科的矛盾，有的学者建议在经费分配等方面，规定一定的比例。有的学者主张将社会科学和自然科学的研究工作分开领导，因为两者的具体情况不一样。他们建议使哲学、社会科学学部带有更大的独立性。
