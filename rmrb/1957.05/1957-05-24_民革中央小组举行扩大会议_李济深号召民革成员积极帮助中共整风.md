    Central Committee Group of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee Holds Enlarged Meeting
    Li Jishen Calls on KMT Revolutionary Committee Members to Actively Help the CCP in Rectification

    (Our newspaper's dispatch) On the morning of the 22nd, the Central Committee Group of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang held an enlarged meeting to study how to assist the Communist Party in its rectification campaign. More than 40 people, including the Chairman, Vice-Chairmen, Standing Committee members, and Central Committee members in Beijing, attended the meeting, which was presided over by Chairman Li Jishen.

    Chairman Li Jishen said at the beginning of the forum: The Chinese Communist Party has already begun its rectification movement. The CCP Central Committee has repeatedly called on non-Party members to offer criticism on united front work and all aspects of the Communist Party, and to actively help the Communist Party in its rectification. The KMT Revolutionary Committee is a long-term cooperative partner in the team dedicated to the cause of socialism under the leadership of the CCP, and we should actively help the CCP promote rectification through the united front approach.

    Chen Shaoxian believes that it is not good for some people to have the idea of breaking away from the leadership of the Communist Party in expressing their opinions.

    Chen Shaoxian said in his speech that "letting go" and "contending" are happening in various places, and some are doing it well, while others are not. Today, helping the Communist Party with rectification should be done in the spirit of cherishing the Party and under the leadership of the Party. From the newspapers, some people have the idea of breaking away from the leadership of the Communist Party in their expressions, which he believes is not good. He said, do not regard the entire Communist Party as sectarian, otherwise there will be no long-term coexistence. The leadership of the Party is good, and the poor work style of Party committees and Party groups is another matter. He said that incorrect thoughts and statements should not be published in newspapers. He believes that while boldly "letting go" and "contending," it is also necessary to prevent anti-Party tendencies. He believes that the speech by Ding Guitang, Deputy Director of the General Administration of Customs, published on the fourth page of the People's Daily on May 17, represents the general situation of the KMT Revolutionary Committee members.

    Su Congzhou said: The reflection of the situation should be truthful, and don't take a venting attitude when making suggestions

    Su Congzhou said that, judging from the situation in the Ministry of Railways, the wall between the Party and non-Party members seems to exist, but not seriously, like a glass wall. He analyzed the reasons for the general so-called walls and ditches, saying that they come from two aspects. From the perspective of Party members, they are dizzy with victory. In the past, in the cruel revolutionary struggle, it was not easy to trust others, and after victory, they looked down on others. From the perspective of non-Party members, it is out of a sense of inferiority, feeling that they are inferior to the Communist Party in everything; some people cannot withstand storms, and after being rectified once, they are like startled birds, usually seeking no merit, but seeking no demerit; some people also have a sense of pride. He said, how to tear down the walls now? He believes that non-Party members must first muster the courage to boldly contend and let go, without any worries; second, to help the Communist Party with rectification, they must take a sincere and serious attitude, in the spirit of gentle breeze and fine rain, and use the formula of unity—criticism—unity, and the reflection of the situation must be truthful. As for the "new ditch," he believes that to avoid adding new ditches, when making suggestions to Party members, do not take a venting attitude, and do not kill with one blow. To help others, one must also improve oneself.

    Liu Fei said in his speech that the KMT Revolutionary Committee is one of the assistants in leading the Party's rectification, and KMT Revolutionary Committee members cannot stand idly by. At the same time, he believes that bureaucratism, sectarianism, and subjectivism undeniably exist within the KMT Revolutionary Committee as well. "Are we that good?" Therefore, he said that KMT Revolutionary Committee members should also strengthen their own ideological transformation, and during the Communist Party's rectification, combine it with their own thoughts, "look in their own mirrors," and transform and improve themselves through rectification.

    Ning Wu said in his speech that the general Party members and cadres do not understand the changes in the objective situation well enough, and their understanding is still at the level of the anti-rebellion period. It is right for Communist Party members to have class stand and class hatred. In the past, there was class struggle, so there was naturally sectarianism. Most members of democratic parties come from the petty bourgeoisie and the bourgeoisie, and the Communist Party members' views are also correct. In the past, Party members were too vigilant against non-Party members. But now, the domestic class struggle has basically ended, the situation has changed, and the Communist Party members' understanding should catch up. He said that to help the leading Party with rectification, the main issue at present is to establish revolutionary feelings between Party members and non-Party members, and gradually establish class friendship. He said that in the past, the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee addressed him as "Mr." in their letters, but now they call him comrade, which he finds very kind. He also believes that only by establishing revolutionary feelings can one have the strength to participate in rectification. Revolutionary feelings should not be a state of complete harmony, with nodding and bowing when meeting, but members of democratic parties tend to show this more. He mentioned that Party committees at all levels, especially provincial and municipal Party committees, are very tired from their work, and their bureaucratism is also hard-working bureaucratism.

    Why did Long Yun's "mood become depressed" after participating in the United Front Work Department meeting? Because he believes that the people who spoke "did not make it step by step, but step by step."

    Long Yun believes that rectification is about finding past mistakes. He said, why rectify the Communist Party's style? This is related to the issue of having a position without power. The Communist Party is the ruling party, and those with positions and power make more mistakes. He even believes that the mistakes of the democratic parties are also related to the Communist Party. Rectifying the Communist Party's style is reasonable. He said that after returning from this trip, he was greatly encouraged by seeing the speeches of Ma Yinchu, Zhang Xiruo, Zhang Naiqi, and others in the newspapers. However, after participating in the forum held by the United Front Work Department of the CCP Central Committee on the 21st, his mood became depressed because the people who spoke had reservations, had concerns, and said a lot of compromising words. He believes that if this continues, it will cool down, "not making it step by step, but step by step," and will not be of much help to the CCP. He believes that having concerns is understandable. He said that in the past few major movements, the Communist Party rectified people, and now is the Communist Party testing everyone's thoughts for future rectification? He said that the time is different now! He believes that Communist Party members make mistakes, not just one or two, everyone knows, and the Communist Party must find a way to change. The Communist Party is the ruling party, how could it go back on its word and play such a big joke, letting everyone expose their thoughts and then rectify them.

    Weng Wenhao said that the most important thing at present is to encourage KMT Revolutionary Committee members to boldly "let go" and "contend" and help the Communist Party with rectification. He said, we are working under a common goal, jointly building socialism, we must eliminate concerns, and we must raise and criticize the shortcomings of the Communist Party. He believes that not raising them is not patriotism. He said that the Communist Party will not retaliate, and believing that they will retaliate is distrusting the leadership of the Communist Party. He also said, "Our ideological transformation cannot be said to be completely successful, it can only be said to have achieved considerable success."

    Liu Zhongrong, Li Jue, Zhou Binglin, Zhang Zhen, Qin Yizhi, Chen Shaokuan, Wu Xinda and others also spoke at the meeting.

    民革中央小组举行扩大会议
    李济深号召民革成员积极帮助中共整风
    本报讯　22日上午，中国国民党革命委员会中央小组举行扩大会议，研究如何帮助共产党整风。到主席、副主席、常务委员、在京中央委员四十多人，会议由李济深主席主持。
    李济深主席在座谈会开始时说：中国共产党已经开始整风运动。中共中央一再号召党外人士对统战工作以至共产党一切方面提出批评，积极帮助共产党整风。民革是在中共领导下，致力于社会主义事业队伍中的长期合作共事者，我们对于中共通过统一战线的方式推动整风，自应积极帮助。
    有些人在发表意见中有摆脱共产党领导的想法，陈劭先认为这是不好的。
    陈劭先发言说，现在各地都在“放”“鸣”，有的放的好，有的放的不好。今天帮助共产党整风，应当本着爱护党的精神，在党的领导下进行。从报纸上看，有些人在发表的意见中，有摆脱共产党的领导的想法，他认为这是不好的。他说，不要把整个共产党都看成是宗派主义的，那样就谈不到长期共存了。党的领导是好的，党委、党组作风不好，是另一个问题。他说，不正确的思想言论，报纸不应当发表。他认为一方面要大胆“鸣”“放”，一方面也要防止反党倾向。他认为5月17日人民日报第四版刊登的海关总署副署长丁贵堂的发言，代表了民革成员的一般情况。
    苏从周说：反映情况要真实，提意见时不要采取出气态度
    苏从周说，他从铁道部的情况看，党与非党之间的墙似有似无，情况不严重，像一道玻璃墙。他分析一般所谓墙、沟发生的原因时说，这来自两方面。从党员方面说，是胜利冲昏头脑，过去在残酷的革命斗争中，不容易相信别人，胜利以后，又瞧不起别人。从非党人士方面说，是出于自卑感，觉得处处不如共产党；有些人经不起暴风雨，挨过一次整，就像惊弓之鸟，平时不求有功，但求无过；有人也有骄傲情绪。他说，现在怎样拆墙呢？他认为党外人士第一要拿出勇气来，大胆鸣放，不要有顾虑；第二，帮助共产党整风，要本着诚恳严肃的态度，和风细雨的精神，团结—批评—团结的公式，反映情况要真实。至于“新沟”，他认为，要想不增加新沟，向党员提意见的时候，不要采取出气的态度，一棍子打死。要帮助别人，也要提高自己。
    刘斐在发言中谈到，领导党整风，民革是助手之一，民革成员不能袖手旁观。他同时认为，官僚主义、宗派主义、主观主义，不可否认地在民革内部也存在着，“我们就那么好”？因此他说，民革成员也应该加强自己的思想改造，在共产党整风期间，结合自己的思想，“照自己的镜子”，通过整风，改造和提高自己。
    宁武发言说，一般党员干部对客观形势的变化还不够理解，认识还停留在肃反时期的水平上。共产党员有阶级立场、阶级仇恨，是对的。过去有阶级斗争，自然有宗派。民主党派成员多出身小资产阶级、资产阶级，共产党员的看法，也是对的。过去，党员对党外人士防范太严。可是现在，国内阶级斗争基本结束了，情况变了，共产党员的认识应该赶上来。他说，帮助领导党整风，当前主要的问题是要党内外建立革命感情，逐渐建立阶级友爱。他说，过去辽宁省委给他的信件称他是“先生”，现在称同志，他觉得很亲切。他还认为，建立了革命感情，参加整风，才能有力量。革命感情，也不应该是一团和气，见面点头哈腰，而民主党派成员这方面的表现多一点。他谈到，各级党委，特别是省委、市委，他们工作很累，有官僚主义也是辛辛苦苦的官僚主义。
    龙云参加统战部会议后为什么“情绪反而低落了”呢？因为他认为发言的人提意见“没有作到步步紧，而是步步松了”。
    龙云认为整风就是找过去的错误。他说为什么整共产党的风？这联系到有职无权的问题。共产党是执政党，有职有权的人错误就多。他甚至认为，民主党派的错误，也和共产党有关。整共产党的风，有道理。他说，他这次出发回来，在报纸上看到马寅初、张奚若、章乃器等人的发言，受到很大鼓舞。但自己参加了21日中共中央统战部召开的座谈会以后，情绪反而低落了，因为发言的人有保留，有顾虑，折中的话很多。他认为这样下去会冷下来，“没有作到步步紧，而是步步松”，对中共帮助力量不大了。他认为，有顾虑可以理解。他说，过去几个大运动，都是共产党整人，现在是不是共产党测验大家的思想，以便以后整人？他说，现在时机不同了！他认为，共产党员犯错误，不是一个两个，大家都知道，共产党要想办法改变。共产党是执政党，怎会出尔反尔，开这样大的玩笑，让大家把思想暴露出来，然后再整。
    翁文灏说，目前最主要的是要鼓励民革成员大胆“鸣”“放”，帮助共产党整风。他说，我们是在共同目标下工作，共同建设社会主义，要取消顾虑，对共产党的缺点，要提，要批评。他认为，不提就是不爱国。他说，共产党不会报复的，认为会报复是不信任共产党的领导。他还说，“我们的思想改造并不能说完全成功，只能说有相当成就”。
    在会议上发言的，还有刘仲容、李觉、周炳琳、张轸、覃异之、陈绍宽、吴信达等人。
