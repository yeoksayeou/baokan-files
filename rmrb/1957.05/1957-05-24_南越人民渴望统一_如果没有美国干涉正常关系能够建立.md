Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 23rd May: The leader of the British Labour Party delegation, Harold Davies, said in Hanoi that the people of South Vietnam universally hoped for North-South reunification, and even some ministers and government personnel in the Southern regime hoped for this.

The British Labour Party MP, who had visited Saigon for four days with two other Labour Party MPs before returning to Hanoi, said that he had not met anyone in the South who regarded the 17th parallel as a long-term boundary. However, Ngo Dinh Diem made the issue difficult. He said that Ngo Dinh Diem's argument that the American border extended to the 17th parallel in Vietnam was "not only unreasonable and stupid, but also very dangerous for Southeast Asia."

Harold Davies, who led the British Labour Party delegation, had been visiting Vietnam for more than twenty days. He made these remarks at a press conference yesterday before leaving Hanoi. He also said that some people in the Southern regime were willing to negotiate with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Normal relations between the North and South could be established without US interference.

He pointed out that most of the US aid to South Vietnam was used to build up the military and did little to improve the lives of the people. Another member of the delegation, William Warbey, said that Ngo Dinh Diem was unwilling to reunify, and if Vietnam was unified, Ngo Dinh Diem's system would come to an end.

    南越人民渴望统一
    如果没有美国干涉正常关系能够建立
    据新华社河内23日电　英国工党议员代表团团长哈罗德·戴维斯在河内说，越南南方的人民普遍希望南北统一，甚至南方政权中有些部长和政府人员也这样希望。
    这位曾经同其他两位工党议员前往西贡访问了四天回到河内的英国工党议员说，他在南方没有遇见一个人把十七度线看作是长期的分界线。但是，吴庭艳使这个问题陷于困难。他说，吴庭艳的关于美国边界延伸到越南十七度线的论调，“不但是毫无道理和愚蠢的，而且对东南亚来说是很危险的。”
    哈罗德·戴维斯率领英国工党议员代表团已经在越南访问了二十多天。他昨天在离开河内前的一次记者招待会上说了这番话。他还说，南方政权中有些人是愿意同越南民主共和国谈判的。如果没有美国的干涉，南北的正常关系是能够建立起来的。
    他指出，美国对南越的援助大部分用在建立军队，对于改善人民生活没有什么帮助。代表团的另一个议员威廉·华贝说，吴庭艳是不愿意统一的，如果越南得到统一的话，吴庭艳的制度将要结束。
