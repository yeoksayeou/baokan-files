Preventing disease first and foremost is a fundamental principle of socialist health work; only in a socialist country can this principle be implemented.

Our country's health work, following the principle of prevention first, has already made tremendous achievements: several diseases that most seriously endanger people's health, such as cholera, smallpox, and human plague, have been basically eliminated or brought under control, and the incidence of other infectious diseases has also decreased to varying degrees. Recently, various regions have also actively carried out prevention and treatment of schistosomiasis, malaria, kala-azar, etc.; investigations and research have also been conducted on certain endemic diseases and occupational diseases in factories and mines. Through several years of work, the health departments have summarized an experience: to fully implement the principle of prevention first, health work must be combined with mass movements.

However, at present, the principle of prevention first has not been fully and deeply implemented in our country's health undertakings; educating and organizing the masses to carry out health prevention work has not been done universally and in a timely manner. Last winter, measles was prevalent in various regions, and scarlet fever occurred in individual regions; since the beginning of spring this year, influenza has occurred in many regions, and even cerebrospinal meningitis has occurred in some regions, all of which are the result of inadequate prevention work.

Of course, under the current conditions, due to the limitations of the level of medical science development, it is not yet possible to provide more effective methods to completely stop and eliminate these diseases. However, on the basis of the improved living standards of the people and the great achievements made in the people's health cause, as long as we earnestly strive to implement the principle of prevention first and combining health work with mass movements in all aspects, it is entirely possible to effectively control certain diseases, reduce their spread and prevalence, and greatly reduce the incidence rate. For example, after the patriotic health movement was launched throughout the country in 1956, the incidence of various infectious diseases in many cities decreased. The incidence of various infectious diseases in Nanjing decreased by 37.67% compared with 1955, the incidence of malaria in Fuzhou decreased by 60% compared with 1956, and the incidence of typhoid fever decreased by 67%. Also, the Tianjin Heavy Machinery Plant once experienced an outbreak of influenza, and more than 130 employees became ill in just over ten days; the neighboring wool textile factory, during the same period, promptly took preventive measures, immediately isolating patients upon discovery, and carrying out publicity of preventive knowledge to employees, and influenza did not spread there. This shows that mobilizing the masses to do a good job in prevention is the fundamental way to prevent diseases.

Preventing diseases and fighting against diseases is a constant, arduous, and complex task. Especially in our country, with a large population, relatively backward economy and culture, and the unhygienic habits and backward hygienic scientific knowledge left over from the old society are still very common. To do a good job in preventing diseases, the health departments cannot be satisfied with general appeals and publicity, but must go deep into the masses to do extremely meticulous organizational work and propaganda and education work. This requires carrying out the patriotic health movement more widely and deeply, taking appropriate forms to organize the activists who have emerged in the movement, giving them regular health education, making them the basic force that constantly promotes the patriotic health movement, going deep into every corner of the masses' lives and production, carrying out practical health propaganda and organizational work, and constantly promoting the masses to learn health knowledge, participate in health activities, gradually change unhygienic habits, and develop good hygienic habits. Basic-level medical institutions should formulate practical and feasible systems and methods to closely combine treatment and prevention work. Health and epidemic prevention institutions must strengthen the investigation and research of diseases and play a technical guidance role in health and epidemic prevention throughout the entire health and medical network. To achieve these goals, the key issue is that the health departments must strengthen the leadership of health and epidemic prevention institutions, medical institutions, and the patriotic health movement.

In recent years, the Red Cross Society of China has developed members, established grassroots organizations, and trained Red Cross health workers in many cities, established health stations, and has done a lot of work in uniting health activists and mobilizing the masses to deeply carry out the patriotic health movement, assisting basic-level health and medical institutions in carrying out health publicity, epidemic prevention, first aid, and guidance on environmental hygiene, family care, etc. Experience has proved that it is a suitable organizational form for combining health work with mass movements. It can serve as a link between the health department and the masses and as an assistant in carrying out mass health movements. The health department should pay attention to this mass organization and make full use of their strength. In order to expand the mass ranks of health prevention work, the Red Cross Society should, in the future, systematically absorb the activists in the health movement as members, give them regular health knowledge and education on mutual assistance, friendship, revolutionary humanitarianism of saving lives and helping the wounded, and take on the work of mobilizing and organizing the masses in the patriotic health movement, and more and better assist health and medical institutions, deeply carry out health publicity, carry out activities such as eliminating pests and diseases, reporting epidemics, family care, and first aid for accidental injuries.

In order to fully implement the principle of prevention first and strengthen the force to fight against diseases, party organizations and government departments at all levels should regularly pay attention to and check the health work in their areas. Health departments at all levels should make appropriate arrangements for the work of health and epidemic prevention, medical prevention institutions, and mass health organizations, closely link their work, and give play to all positive factors. All people's organizations should regularly educate their members to pay attention to hygiene. The broad masses of the people, in order to protect their own health and strengthen the strength of socialist construction, should all take action and do a good job in health prevention work.

### 用群众力量预防疾病

    用群众力量预防疾病
    预防为主，是社会主义保健事业的基本方针；也只有在社会主义国家里，这个方针才能得到贯彻。
    我国卫生工作遵循着预防为主的方针，已经做出了巨大的成绩：几种危害人民健康最严重的疾病，如霍乱、天花、人间鼠疫基本上已经消灭了，或者被控制住了，其他传染病发病率也有不同程度的降低。近来各地对血吸虫病、疟疾、黑热病等也积极进行了防治；对某些地方病、厂矿企业的职业病也进行了调查研究工作。经过几年来的工作，卫生部门总结了一条经验：全面贯彻预防为主方针，必须把卫生工作和群众运动相结合。
    但是，目前在我国卫生事业中，对预防为主的方针贯彻得还不够全面、不够深入；教育和组织群众开展卫生预防工作，还做得不普遍、不及时。去年冬天，各地流行麻疹，个别地区发生猩红热；今年开春以来，不少地区发生流行性感冒，有的地区还发生脑脊髓膜炎，这都是预防工作做得不够好的结果。
    当然，在现在的条件下，由于医学科学发展水平的限制，还不能提供更有效的办法，来把这些疾病完全加以制止和消灭。但是，在人民生活已有改善，人民卫生事业已取得很大成绩的基础上，只要我们认真努力从各个方面贯彻预防为主和卫生工作与群众运动相结合的方针，有效地控制某些疾病，减少它的传布和流行，并且大大地降低发病率，是完全可能的。如1956年全国各地开展爱国卫生运动以后，许多城市的各种传染病发病率下降了。南京市各种传染病发病率比1955年下降了37.67％，福州市疟疾发病率比1956年下降了60％，伤寒发病率下降了67％。又，天津重型机器厂，有一次发生流行性感冒，在十多天里，就有一百三十多个职工患病；邻近的毛纺织厂在同一时期内，及时地采取了预防措施，发现病人即时隔离，并向职工进行了预防知识的宣传，流行性感冒就没有在那里流行起来。这说明发动群众做好预防工作，是预防疾病的根本办法。
    预防疾病，同疾病作斗争，是经常的、艰巨的、复杂的工作。特别是我国人口众多，经济文化还比较落后，旧社会遗留下来的不卫生习惯和卫生科学知识落后的现象还很普遍，要搞好预防疾病的工作，卫生部门就不能满足于一般化的号召和宣传，而要深入到群众中去做极细致的组织工作和宣传教育工作。这就要更加广泛和深入地开展爱国卫生运动，采取适当形式把运动中涌现出来的积极分子组织起来，给以经常的卫生教育，使他们成为经常推动爱国卫生运动的基本力量，深入到群众生活和生产的各个角落，进行切合实际的卫生宣传和组织工作，经常地推动群众学习卫生知识，参加卫生活动，逐渐改变不卫生的习惯，培养良好的卫生习惯。基层医疗机构应当制定切实可行的制度和办法，将治疗和预防工作密切结合起来。卫生防疫机构必须加强对疾病的调查研究，在整个卫生医疗网中发挥卫生防疫的技术指导作用。要达到这些目的，关键问题在于卫生部门要加强对卫生防疫机构、医疗机构以及对爱国卫生运动的领导。
    几年来，我国的红十字会在许多城市发展会员，建立基层组织和训练红十字卫生员，建立卫生站，对于团结卫生积极分子和发动群众深入开展爱国卫生运动，协助基层卫生医疗机构开展卫生宣传、防疫、急救和指导环境卫生、家庭护理等等方面，做了不少的工作。经验证明，它是把卫生工作同群众运动相结合的一种适宜的组织形式。它可以作为卫生部门联系群众的纽带和开展群众卫生运动的助手。卫生部门应当重视这一群众性的组织并充分运用他们的力量。为了扩大卫生预防工作的群众队伍，红十字会今后应该有步骤地把卫生运动中的积极分子吸收为会员，给以经常的卫生知识和互助友爱、救死扶伤的革命人道主义的教育，在爱国卫生运动中担负发动和组织群众的工作，更多地更好地协助卫生医疗机构，深入开展卫生宣传，进行除害灭病、疫情报告、家庭护理和意外伤害的急救等等活动。
    为了全面贯彻预防为主的方针，加强同疾病作斗争的力量，各级党组织、政府部门应该经常注意和检查本地区的卫生工作。各级卫生部门应该对卫生防疫、医疗预防机构和群众卫生组织的工作，进行恰当的安排，密切它们之间的工作联系，发挥一切积极因素。各人民团体应该经常教育自己的成员讲究卫生。广大的人民群众为了保护自己的健康，加强社会主义建设力量，应该人人动手，做好卫生预防工作。
