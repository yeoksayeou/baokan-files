This newspaper Changsha, May 12th (Reporter Huang Yubai): The Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, at a telephone conference of prefectural and municipal party committee secretaries held on May 10th, instructed all localities to correctly recognize and handle the most pressing and prominent contradictions among the people in the current rural areas, continue to do a good job in pre-autumn production, further implement democratic cooperative management, and strive for a bumper agricultural harvest.

Currently, counties throughout Hunan Province are holding conferences with the participation of party and non-party cadres and intellectuals to study and discuss how to correctly handle the problem of contradictions among the people. The Provincial Party Committee pointed out that this will be the beginning of a great transformation in promoting rural work throughout the province and achieving new accomplishments. Therefore, how to correctly recognize the new situation and new problems pointed out in Chairman Mao's report, and thereby learn to use new viewpoints and new working methods to handle problems, especially after realizing that current contradictions among the people have been largely and centrally manifested, how exactly to grasp the most prominent, pressing, and concrete contradictions among them, and give them correct treatment, is a problem that must be emphatically resolved at county meetings.

The Provincial Party Committee pointed out: At present, the work of rice transplanting has been or is about to be completed throughout the province, and many agricultural cooperatives have developed diversified operations better than last year. This year's spring plowing and production campaign has already achieved considerable results. However, it must be seen that, in terms of rice production, only a foundation has been laid. There is still much work to be done to strive for a bumper rice harvest. Cooperatives that have done a better job in diversified operations are only off to a good start, and most agricultural cooperatives still do not pay enough attention to diversified operations. All crops that should be sown in this season and sideline production that should be started must be seized and sown and carried out in season. Otherwise, losses will be caused. In addition, agricultural cooperatives throughout the province still have many problems in summarizing the previous stage of production and arranging future work. These problems are centrally manifested as contradictions between the cooperative and its members, and between members. Therefore, doing a good job in current production, further implementing democratic cooperative management, and striving for a bumper harvest this year are the problems that the broad masses of the people in rural areas urgently demand to be solved, and are also the most prominent contradictions among the people in rural areas. Neglecting this aspect will alienate the vast majority of the peasant masses and deepen the contradictions among the people in rural areas.

The Provincial Party Committee believes that at the current conferences being held in various counties, rural work cadres must focus on studying and discussing this issue. It is required that after the meetings, all agricultural cooperatives must spend ten days to half a month to seriously discuss and revise this year's production plan, settle and publicize the accounts since the beginning of this year's spring plowing production, rationally determine the labor subsidies for cooperative cadres, and earnestly do a good job in the pre-distribution of spring and summer harvest crops, and commend and encourage the advantages of cooperative cadres and members in the previous stage of production, and overcome shortcomings in their work. At the same time, all localities are required to actively expand the democratic life within the cooperatives, establish a system of timely public disclosure of financial income and expenditure, and cultivate the habit of cadres consulting with the masses on handling affairs and participating in and leading production. The central link in doing the above work well is to fully mobilize the masses and conscientiously hold members' representative meetings.

The Provincial Party Committee finally pointed out that this effort to carry out democratic cooperative management and strive for a bumper harvest is a cooperative rectification adapted to the current situation, an important step in implementing the central government's instructions on correctly handling contradictions among the people, improving the leadership of the cooperatives, and grasping pre-autumn production. Therefore, county party committees and township general branches must study and improve leadership methods in practice, and all departments related to rural work should continue to vigorously support the peasants in striving for a bumper harvest under the leadership of the party committee.

    湖南省委要求全省抓紧当前农村最突出的矛盾
    搞好秋前生产　坚持民主办社　争取大丰收
    本报长沙12日电　本报记者黄驭白报道：中共湖南省委在5月10日召开的地市委书记电话会议上，指示各地必须正确认识和处理当前农村人民内部最迫切最突出的矛盾问题，继续搞好秋前生产，进一步贯彻民主办社，争取农业大丰收。
    目前，湖南全省各县正在召开有党内外干部和知识分子参加的大会，学习讨论如何正确处理人民内部矛盾问题。省委指出，这将是促进全省农村工作伟大的转变和取得新的成就的开始。因此，如何正确认识毛主席报告中所指出的新形势、新问题，从而学会用新的观点、新的工作方法来处理问题，特别是在认识到当前人民内部矛盾已经大量地集中表现出来以后，究竟如何抓住其中最突出最迫切而具体的矛盾，予以正确的处理，是各县会议上必须着重解决的问题。
    省委指出：现在全省插秧工作已经或即将结束，许多农业社的多种经营比去年开展得好，今年的春耕生产运动已经取得不小成绩。但是必须看到，目前在稻谷生产上仅仅打下基础，要争取稻谷丰收，还有许多工作要做。多种经营开展较好的社，也只是有个好的开端，大部分农业社对多种经营仍然注意得不够。一切在这个季节里应当播种的作物和应当动手的副业生产，都必须抓紧季节播种和进行。否则，便将造成损失。另外，全省各地农业社在总结前段生产和安排今后工作上还有不少问题，这些问题集中表现为社与社员、社员与社员之间的矛盾。因此，搞好当前生产，进一步贯彻民主办社，争取今年大丰收，便是当前农村广大人民迫切要求解决的问题，也是农村人民内部最突出的矛盾。忽视这方面，便会脱离最大多数的农民群众，使农村人民内部矛盾加深起来。
    省委认为，在目前各县正在召开的大会上，农村工作干部必须着重研究和讨论这个问题。要求会议结束后，所有农业社都必须用十天至半个月的时间，认真讨论和修订今年生产计划，结清和公布今年春耕生产以来的账目，合理地确定社干部的劳动补贴，切实做好春收夏收作物的预分工作，表扬和鼓励社干部、社员在前段生产中的优点，克服工作中的缺点。同时，要求各地农业社积极扩大社内民主生活，建立按时公开财政收支的制度，养成干部经常和群众商量办事和参加生产领导生产的习惯。做好以上工作的中心环节，就是要充分发动群众，认真开好社员代表大会。
    省委最后指出，这次开展民主办社、争取丰收，就是适应目前情况的一次整社，就是贯彻和执行中央关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的指示，改进社的领导，抓好秋前生产的重要步骤。因此县委和乡总支，必须在实践中研究改进领导方法，所有和农村工作有关的部门，应当在党委领导下，继续大力支援农民争取丰收。
