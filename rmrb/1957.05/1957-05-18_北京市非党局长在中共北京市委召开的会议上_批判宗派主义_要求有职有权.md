Beijing News: From the afternoon of May 14th to 17th, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China invited non-Party bureau directors and deputy directors from government and other departments to a forum to solicit their opinions for the Municipal Committee and the Municipal People's Committee. Liu Ren, Second Secretary of the Municipal Committee, Secretaries Zheng Tianxiang and Chen Peng, and Deputy Mayors Zhang Youyu, Feng Jiping, and Jia Tingsan attended the meeting.

The following individuals spoke at the meeting: Li Yi, Deputy Director of the Handicraft Industry Bureau; Wang Mingzhi, Director of the Road Engineering Bureau; Zhang Jincheng, Director of the Foreign Trade Bureau; Jiao Juyin, Deputy Director of the Beijing People's Art Theatre; Yan Jingqing, Director of the Public Health Bureau; Lou Bangyan, Deputy Director of the Justice Bureau; Li Boqiu, Director of the Second Commercial Bureau; Chen Mingshao, Director of the Water Supply and Sewerage Engineering Bureau; Mo Yichang, Deputy Director of the Transportation Bureau; Deng Jixing, Deputy Director of the Civil Affairs Bureau; Sui Jingren, Deputy Director of the Second Local Industry Bureau; Chen Mingde, Deputy Director of the Urban Services Bureau; Weng Dujian, Director of the Education Bureau; Pu Jiexu, Director of the Grain Bureau; Liu Zhenfu, Deputy Director of the Water Supply and Sewerage Engineering Bureau; Wang Tongqi, Deputy Director of the Education Bureau; Guan Shixiong, Deputy Director of the Workers' and Peasants' Spare-time Education Bureau; Zhong Sen, Deputy Director of the Construction Engineering Bureau; Sun Chengpei, Deputy Director of the Culture Bureau; Liang Sicheng, Deputy Director of the Urban Planning Commission; and Fan Chongwu, Deputy Director of the Third Local Industry Bureau.

In their speeches, they focused on sharply criticizing sectarianism, bureaucracy, and subjectivism, which caused a sense of superiority among Party members, a lack of importance attached to non-Party cadres, and a divide between the Party and non-Party masses, resulting in non-Party individuals holding positions as bureau directors and deputy directors with responsibilities but without real power. Many also put forward many constructive suggestions in their speeches. Jiao Juyin said:

	Consulting with Non-Party Leaders
	Is Nothing More Than a Formality

The participants cited many facts to illustrate the problem of non-Party bureau directors and deputy directors holding positions without real power; some bureaus were basically normal, while others were seriously affected. Jiao Juyin said: "At the Beijing People's Art Theatre, I am in charge of professional work. When some issues are brought up for discussion, the Party group has actually already made a decision. The so-called discussion is just a formality. I didn't even know when the theatre added actors. For example, Shu Xiuwen came to our theatre, and I only found out after she arrived. It is sometimes very painful to do work like this without being trusted, and I want to resign and go teach."

Mo Yichang said: "As Deputy Director of the Transportation Bureau, in form, I only have the position, but in reality, the power is very problematic because the Party leadership does not value us. I don't dare to talk about some problems I feel in my work. For example, I am responsible for the transformation of private enterprises. The Party group held a meeting to study this issue, but I didn't know about it, and I wasn't even told about it afterward. How can I do my job well? No matter how enthusiastic I am, I can't bring my initiative into play. I have been distressed and feel that the Party has put me in this position but won't let me participate in relevant work." Deng Jixing said:

	If You Offer Opinions, the Party Member Bureau Director Won't Listen.
	Wouldn't You Just Be Asking For Trouble?

Deng Jixing said: "I have been in Beijing for nine years. I was transferred from Xinmin Daily to Beijing Daily as a consultant, but I actually had nothing to do for a long time; I wasn't even allowed to know how many copies the newspaper circulated. Later, I was transferred to the Civil Affairs Bureau as Deputy Director, and I often only found out about many things in the bureau after they were published in the newspaper. I was not allowed to attend meetings related to my assigned work, such as when I was to handle the transfer of the reformatories to the Education Bureau; I was not notified of the administrative meeting, and I was only told about it after the decision was made. There were many problems with family nurseries. Beijing Daily once forwarded readers' opinions, and I signed them to be investigated and dealt with, but Director Ma suppressed them and did not allow relevant comrades to deal with them, nor did he consult with me. Is this called respect? The central Ministry of Internal Affairs once stipulated that the food expenses for each person per month in temporary shelters should be 7.5 yuan, but we insisted on changing it to 5.2 yuan against this regulation. I raised objections, but the Party member director didn't listen. Over time, I stopped saying some things; because in practice, what I said didn't count, only what the Party member director said counted. Wouldn't I just be asking for trouble if I said more? Once, I met a nursery director named Chen on the street, and I asked him how many children he had now and what the situation was like. He smiled and said that I had been transferred long ago. I was very embarrassed at the time, feeling both amused and annoyed. People thought I was crazy, a truly bureaucratic deputy director, who didn't even know that the cadres in charge of her work had been transferred. But she knew my difficulties! The Party member director didn't even consult with me when transferring a nursery director. The Party's cadre work should not be the responsibility of non-Party bureau directors, but they should inquire about the cadres in charge of their professional work. In short, sectarianism is very strong in the bureau when deciding on personnel matters. I am kept in the dark, so I naturally regard the personnel section as a forbidden area." Finally, she described herself: "In the old society, I was never a lady or a miss; in these years in the new society, I seem to have become an exploiter who doesn't work for a living."

In practice, why is it that the powers of some non-Party bureau directors and deputy directors have not been fully respected? Everyone made further analysis; comprehensively, there are generally several reasons:

	The City's Leading Comrades Do Not Value Non-Party Bureau Directors

First, the city's leading comrades do not pay enough attention to, respect, and trust the work of non-Party bureau directors and deputy directors, and rarely take the initiative to talk to non-Party bureau directors and deputy directors to understand the situation and give instructions on work. Li Yi said: "Deputy Mayor Jia Tingsan is in charge of the Handicraft Industry Bureau, but he does not consult with us based on the division of labor within our bureau leadership, to find the person who should be consulted, but instead, only talks to the Party member director when there is something to discuss." Jiao Juyin said: "When we rehearsed the play 'Test', the script was sent to the Minister of Propaganda of the Municipal Party Committee in advance, and we invited the Minister to guide the rehearsal, but the Minister of Propaganda had opinions and did not talk to me, the Deputy Director and General Director, but only talked to the Party member Director, about where to change and where to move. This sentiment seems to have also affected the masses, and when people in the theatre give us opinions, they also carry a sectarian sentiment. Before Cao Yu joined the Party, the masses always said that the two Party member directors could implement the Party's literary and artistic policies. As soon as Comrade Cao Yu joined the Party, the tone of the people who gave opinions changed, and as a result, it became that I alone could not implement the Party's literary and artistic policies." Chen Mingde said: "The Party member Deputy Mayor who leads us has never looked for me. Whenever I see some Party and government leaders in the city, I always take the initiative to shake hands and nod to them, but the other party does not show enthusiasm."

	Failure to Separate Party and Government

Second, the failure to separate the Party and the government often results in the Party substituting for the government. Everyone feels that in administrative departments, when dealing with work, they are accustomed to understanding the situation and researching and deploying work from the Party system, putting non-Party bureau directors or deputy directors aside, lacking an attitude of cooperation and working together. Everyone believes that it is necessary for the Party to discuss and study internally first, but if, after the Party group has made a decision on a task, it does not hold an administrative meeting to fully research it, or does not take individual forms to sincerely consult with non-Party responsible cadres and listen to their opinions, then that is wrong. This not only fails to bring into play the enthusiasm of non-Party comrades, but also makes it impossible to achieve having position and power. In the past, the Party groups of various bureaus have not paid enough attention to these aspects. Someone described it at the meeting: "We non-Party members hold positions as bureau directors and deputy directors, and our senses are dull. We work as if we are suspended in the air, without support or leadership."

	Some Party Member Cadres Are Rude and Do Not Respect Non-Party Responsible Cadres

Third, the Party lacks education on lower-level Party members obeying higher-level non-Party leaders and respecting the authority of non-Party responsible persons. Therefore, some Party members always believe that non-Party bureau directors and deputy directors are there for united front work and are placed in certain responsible positions as "decorations." They one-sidedly believe that these leaders neither understand the situation nor can solve any problems, and in practice, they show disrespect to their non-Party superiors. In some bureaus, instructions from Party member directors are regarded as sacred edicts, while if a non-Party director or deputy director asks someone to do something, it either takes three months to complete or is simply ignored and not taken seriously. Some Party members even take a rude attitude towards non-Party responsible persons. Lou Bangyan said: "When I was teaching at the University of Political Science and Law, I once disagreed with a Party member Dean of Academic Affairs and pointed out to him that it was not that there were no conditions for scientific research at the University of Political Science and Law. As soon as I finished speaking, a Party member comrade jumped on the table and, with a scolding attitude, said that I should not raise an opinion contrary to the Dean of Academic Affairs, that it would not be bad to teach well, what conditions are there for scientific research, I don't understand the situation, this opinion is not wanted. Is this to convince people with reason?" Many people at the meeting criticized such a sense of superiority and arrogant and unreasonable disregard for others among certain Party members. Guan Shixiong said: "In our country, it is definitely unshakeable that the Communist Party is the leader. But it does not mean that every Communist Party member is the leader of non-Party members, forever managing you."

    北京市非党局长在中共北京市委召开的会议上
    批判宗派主义　要求有职有权
    本报讯　中共北京市委于5月14日到17日的下午，邀请了政府和其他部门的非党局长、副局长座谈会，请他们给市委、市人民委员会提意见。市委第二书记刘仁，书记郑天翔、陈鹏，副市长张友渔、冯基平、贾庭三都出席会议。
    先后在会上发言的有：手工业管理局副局长李毅，道路工程局局长王明之，对外贸易局局长张锦城，北京人民艺术剧院副院长焦菊隐，公共卫生局局长严镜清，司法局副局长楼邦彦，第二商业局局长李伯球，上下水道工程局局长陈明绍，交通运输局副局长莫艺昌，民政局副局长邓季惺，第二地方工业局副局长隋经仁，城市服务局副局长陈铭德，教育局局长翁独健，粮食局局长浦洁修，上下水道工程局副局长刘珍甫，教育局副局长汪通祺，工农业余教育局副局长关世雄，建筑工程局副局长钟森，文化局副局长孙承佩，都市规划委员会副主任梁思成，第三地方工业局副局长范崇武。
    在发言中大家着重就非党人士担任局长、副局长有职、有责、无权，党员有优越感，不重视党外干部，造成党与非党群众之间隔阂的宗派主义，官僚主义，主观主义进行了较尖锐的批评。不少人在发言中，还提出了许多积极的建议。焦菊隐说：
    同非党负责人商量
    不过是一个形式
    会上大家列举了许多事实，说明了非党局长、副局长存在着有职无权的问题；有的局基本上是正常的，有的局表现很严重。焦菊隐说：在北京人民艺术剧院，我分工管业务，有些问题提出来商量的时候，实际上党组已经决定了。所谓商量，不过是一个形式。院里增加了演员，我还不知道。如舒绣文到我们院来，人已经来了我才知道。在不被信任的情况下这样来干工作，有时我很痛苦，想辞职去教书去。
    莫艺昌说：我担任交通运输局副局长，从形式上说，只是有这个职务，权是很有问题的，因为党的领导不重视我们。感到工作中有些问题，也不敢谈，比如我分工主管对私改造工作，党组开会研究这个问题，我也不知道，事后也不告诉我，这叫我怎么做好工作。我有再大的热情，也无法发挥出积极性。我苦恼过，感到党把我摆在这个岗位上，但又不让我参与有关工作。邓季惺说：
    提意见党员局长不听
    再说岂不是自找无趣
    邓季惺说：“我来北京九年了，我由新民报调北京日报当顾问，实际上好久没有事情可做；连报纸发行多少也不让知道，后来还是从黑板报上知道的。以后调到民政局任副局长，对局内好多事情也往往是报纸上发表了才知道。自己分工主管的工作会议不让参加，如要我经办把教养院交给教育局的事，开行政会议不通知我，决定了才告诉我。关于家庭托儿站的问题很多，北京日报曾经转来读者的意见，我签发要调查处理，结果马局长压起来不让有关同志去处理，也不和我商量，这叫做尊重吗。中央内务部曾经规定过临时收容所，每人每月伙食费七元五角，我们不按此规定硬要改为五元二角，我提出意见，党员局长也不听。久而久之，有些话我就不说了；因为在实际工作中，我说的不算，党员局长说的才算数，我要再说不是自讨没趣吗。有一次在街上碰到一个姓陈的托儿所所长，我问他现在有多少孩子，情况怎么样？他笑着说我早就调开了。当时我很窘，啼笑皆非，人家以为我神经病，这位副局长真官僚，连自己管的工作，干部已调动了还不知道。可是她那知道我的苦衷啊！党员局长连调动一个托儿所的所长也不和我商量。党的干部工作，非党局长应该不管，但对自己主管的业务工作方面的干部，应该过问。总之局里在决定人事问题时，宗派情绪很浓。对我保密，我也就自然地视人事科为禁地。最后她形容自己说：“在旧社会里，我没有当过太太、小姐，这几年在新社会里我反而好像成了个不劳而食的剥削者了。”
    在实际工作中，有些非党局长、副局长的职权为什么没有得到充分尊重呢？大家作了进一步分析；综合起来大体上有这样几种原因：
    市的领导同志不重视非党员局长
    一、市的领导同志对非党局长、副局长的工作不够重视、尊重和信任，很少主动找非党局长、副局长谈话，了解情况，指示工作。李毅说：“贾庭三副市长分工管手工业管理局，他不是根据我们局的领导分工，该找谁就找谁，而有事就找党员局长谈。”焦菊隐说：“我们排演话剧‘考验’，事先剧本送给市委宣传部长看，排演时请部长来指导，可是宣传部长有意见不和我这个副院长兼总导演来谈，而只和党员院长说，那里要改，那里要动。这种情绪好像也影响了群众，院内人给我们提意见时，也带有宗派情绪。曹禺入党以前，群众提意见总是说两个党员院长能贯彻执行党的文艺方针，曹禺同志一入党，提意见的人讲话口吻就变了，结果就成了我一个人不能贯彻执行党的文艺方针了。”陈铭德说：“领导我们的党员副市长从来未找过我，见到市内一些党政负责同志，每次总是我主动地找他们握手、点头，但对方也不表示热情相待。”
    党政不分
    二、党政不分，往往以党代政。大家感到在行政部门里，对待工作，习惯从党的系统了解情况，研究布置工作，把非党局长或副局长放在一边，缺乏同他们合作共事的态度。大家认为党内先讨论研究是必要的，但对一项工作，党组做了决定以后，不再开行政会议充分研究，或者不采取个别形式找非党负责干部真诚商量，听取意见，那是不对的。这样不仅不能发挥非党同志的积极性，更不可能做到有职有权了。对这些方面，过去各局的党组注意得很不够。有人在会上形容说：“我们非党人士担任局长、副局长，上下是耳目不灵，做工作像悬在空中，得不到支持和领导。”
    有些党员干部蛮横无理不尊重非党负责干部
    三、党对党员科长和一般党员，缺乏下级服从上级，尊重党外负责人的职权教育。因此，在一些党员中总认为非党局长、副局长是为了统战而来的，放在一定的负责岗位上是“摆饰”。他们片面地认为这些领导人既不了解情况，也不能解决什么问题，在实际工作中表现对非党员上级不尊重。在有些局里，党员局长交代一件工作，视为圣旨，非党员局长或副局长要下面办一件工作，不是拖上三个月，就是根本不理，不当一回事。甚至有些党员对非党负责人采取粗暴的态度。楼邦彦说：“我在政法学院教书的时候，有一次我不同意党员教务长一个意见，向他提出在政法学院并不是没有条件进行科学研究。话刚落音，一个党员同志跳到桌子上，以谩骂的态度，说我不应提出和教务长相反的意见，教好书就不坏了，还有什么条件进行科学研究，不了解情况，这个意见要不得。这是以理服人吗？”对某些这种党员的优越感和蛮横无理目中无人的态度，不少人在会上提出了批评。关世雄说：“在我们国家里，以共产党为领导，这是肯定不移的。但不等于每一个共产党员都是党外人士的领导者，永远管你们的。”
