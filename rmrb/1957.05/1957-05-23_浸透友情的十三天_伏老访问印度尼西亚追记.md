    Thirteen Days Immersed in Friendship
    —A Record of Comrade Voroshilov’s Visit to Indonesia
　　Xie Lingfeng
    Comrade Voroshilov and his entourage have already left Jakarta for three days, but the dozens of bright Indonesian and Soviet flags erected in front of the Presidential Palace are still fluttering in the blue sky and green trees. At night, the huge portraits of Comrade Voroshilov and President Sukarno on the main thoroughfares are still shining brightly under the mercury lamps. And the main topic of conversation with Indonesian friends these past two days has still been the unprecedented grand welcome for Comrade Voroshilov. Like a family after a delightful celebration, the Indonesian people seem to want to keep this joyful atmosphere for as long as possible.
    I, along with dozens of Indonesian and other international journalists, followed the Soviet dignitaries to visit many places, which made me understand the feelings of the Indonesian people even better. The Indonesian people treated the Soviet guests as the most distinguished guests and the most intimate friends. From Jakarta to Bandung, Yogyakarta, Solo, Bali, Surabaya, and Medan, President Sukarno personally accompanied Comrade Voroshilov; the responsible military and government officials in various places greeted them ten miles outside the city with the most solemn etiquette to welcome the state guests.
    Every place the Soviet guests passed through and visited was filled with a jubilant festive atmosphere. Schools and government offices were closed, and countless Indonesian and Soviet flags formed a sea of flags. Hillsides, treetops, and buildings were filled with welcoming crowds, and cheering masses often crowded Comrade Voroshilov and President Sukarno's cars so much that they could not move forward; fragrant flower petals rained down on the dignitaries, covering the roads.
    A mass rally held in a city to welcome Comrade Voroshilov was often attended by one hundred thousand or hundreds of thousands of people, almost half or most of the city's population. Many people came from nearby towns and counties, and trains and buses added extra services specifically for people coming from afar. According to government orders, if it was for welcoming Comrade Voroshilov, tickets could be discounted by half or free. In order to catch a glimpse of Comrade Voroshilov's demeanor, many people turned out with their entire families; many people stayed up all night, put on new clothes, carried their children on their shoulders, and rushed into the city to wait on the roads that Comrade Voroshilov would pass. This was an unprecedented phenomenon in Indonesia's reception of foreign guests.
    The amiable and approachable attitude of Comrade Voroshilov and the Soviet guests made the emotions between hosts and guests even more warm and harmonious.
    At a mass rally in Medan, both Comrade Voroshilov and President Sukarno gave speeches. When they were about to leave the venue, the masses affectionately and earnestly requested from the stage: "Don't leave, stay with us a little longer!" The two heads of state stayed. President Sukarno, in order to let the masses see more of the dignitaries, invited all the Soviet guests who came with Comrade Voroshilov onto the stage one by one and introduced them to everyone. When he introduced Comrade Voroshilov's son, Comrade Voroshilov specially struck a fatherly pose, reaching out and twisting the ear of the burly young Voroshilov, and the entire audience burst into cheerful laughter and cheers.
    This harmonious atmosphere, like that of close friends and relatives, has always filled the space between Comrade Voroshilov and the Indonesian people. Comrade Voroshilov, with a ruddy complexion and a head of silver hair, looked even more kind and gentle as he talked and laughed. Comrade Voroshilov often talked cordially with the Indonesian people, sang with the young people, and allowed the Indonesian people to be with him without restraint, like being with an ordinary old uncle. Therefore, some Indonesians called Comrade Voroshilov "Moro Silo." The meaning of these two Indonesian words is: "Sit cross-legged and talk cordially." Two Indonesian peasant women, one in her eighties and one in her nineties, held Comrade Voroshilov's hand and called this seventy-six-year-old marshal and chairman "my young brother," urging him to take care of his health.
    It is easy to understand why the Indonesian people warmly welcome Comrade Voroshilov. Because they know that the Soviet Union is their true friend. The Soviet Union firmly supports the Indonesian people's opposition to colonialism, supports the Indonesian people's struggle for independence, and makes outstanding contributions to defending world peace, which the Indonesian people deeply love and respect.
    President Sukarno's speech at the Indonesian-Soviet Friendship Conference in Jakarta aptly expressed the feelings of the Indonesian people. Sukarno said: "Indonesian mothers hold their children by the roadside, even shouting 'Long live Comrade Voroshilov' in the rain, why? This is not only for peace, but also for the love of independence, because in our struggle for independence, the Soviet Union has always stood by our side and supported us. Some claim to be friends of Indonesia, but they carry out subversion in our country; some say they are friends of Indonesia, but they refuse to return West Irian to us." Sukarno said that if they do not recognize the aspirations of our nation, they are not our true friends; even if they give us U.S. dollars pouring down like Niagara Falls, we will not be satisfied.
    Sukarno repeatedly pointed out in several speeches that although the systems of Indonesia and the Soviet Union are different, they can coexist peacefully and become good friends. He hopes that the friendship between Indonesia and the Soviet Union will be consolidated and developed to last forever. Comrade Voroshilov repeatedly expressed his agreement with Sukarno's views.
    Of course, imperialism is afraid and hostile to the development of this friendly relationship between the Soviet Union and Indonesia. During Comrade Voroshilov's visit, they constantly attempted to disrupt and create unpleasant incidents. The illegal armed "Islamic Army" they supported planned to attack Comrade Voroshilov on his way to Bandung and conspired to sabotage some of the welcome activities in certain places. Personnel from the U.S. Embassy's military attaché office even personally went out late at night to steal the Soviet and Indonesian flags that Jakarta officials had hung up to welcome Comrade Voroshilov. But the Indonesian government and army are vigilant, and the eyes of the Indonesian people are discerning. Saboteurs were often monitored and reported before they could succeed. And the bandits who attempted armed attacks were completely annihilated by the government's army two days before Comrade Voroshilov went to Bandung. Although the Americans who stole the flags fled quickly, three Indonesian youths chased after him closely, finally catching him and sending him to the police station. The U.S. Ambassador to Indonesia had to apologize and admit his mistake, losing all face.
    Now, Comrade Voroshilov has happily and successfully completed his friendly visit to Indonesia. In these short thirteen days, the understanding and friendship between the leaders and peoples of Indonesia and the Soviet Union have been further enhanced. Comrade Voroshilov said in his farewell speech when he left Jakarta: "The friendship between the people of the Soviet Union and Indonesia will become an unbreakable friendship!" At this time, the tens of thousands of Indonesian people who came to bid farewell to the dignitaries immediately burst out with a resounding answer: "Yes, unbreakable!" And Sukarno's reply was: "The Indonesian people's heart of brotherly friendship towards the Soviet people is forever unchangeable!" This accurately expresses the deep friendship between the Indonesian and Soviet peoples, and is also a resounding answer to imperialism.

### 浸透友情的十三天——伏老访问印度尼西亚追记

    浸透友情的十三天
    ——伏老访问印度尼西亚追记
  　谢林风
    伏老和他的随行人员离开雅加达已经三天了，但是竖立在总统府前的几十面鲜艳的印度尼西亚和苏联的国旗，仍旧在蓝天绿树间飘扬。夜里，通衢大道上的伏老和苏加诺的巨幅画像，还是被水银灯照耀得神采奕奕。而这两天同印度尼西亚朋友见面谈天的主要话题，也还是欢迎伏老的空前盛况。像一个家庭做过一场惬意的喜事一样，印度尼西亚人民似乎尽量想把这种欢乐的气氛保持得长久一些。
    我和几十个印度尼西亚以及其他国家的记者跟随苏联贵宾访问了许多地方，因此也使我更加了解印度尼西亚人民的这种心情。印度尼西亚人民把苏联贵宾当做最尊贵的客人、最贴心的朋友来接待。从雅加达到万隆、日惹、梭罗、巴里、泗水和棉兰，苏加诺总统一直亲自陪着伏老；各地方的军政负责官员，都是郊迎十里，以最隆重的礼节来欢迎国宾。
    苏联客人路过和访问的各个地方，都是一派欢腾的节日气象。学校、机关都放假，数不清的印度尼西亚和苏联的国旗，织成一片旗海。山坡、树梢、楼房都站满了欢迎的人群，欢呼着的群众常常把伏老和苏加诺的汽车挤得无法前进；芬芳的花瓣，像雨点一般洒向贵宾，铺满了道路。
    一个城市举行一个欢迎伏老的群众大会，往往就是十万或是几十万人，几乎等于这个城市人口的一半或者大半。许多人是从临近的各乡各县来的，火车、公共汽车专为远地来的人加开班次。根据政府的命令，如果为了欢迎伏老，车票可以打对折或者免费。为了一睹伏老的丰采，很多人是全家出动；许多人整夜不睡，换上新衣，把孩子背在肩上赶进城去，守候在伏老必经的路上。这是印度尼西亚在接待外国客人中从来没有过的现象。
    伏老和苏联客人的和蔼可亲的态度，使主客之间的情绪更为热烈融洽。
    在棉兰的一次群众大会上，伏老和苏加诺都讲过了话。他们要离开会场时，群众却留恋地在台下恳切地要求：“别走，和我们在一起多耽一会儿吧！”两位元首就留下来了。苏加诺总统为了让群众多看看贵宾，于是把所有随伏老来的苏联客人都请上讲台，一一介绍给大家认识。当他介绍到伏老的儿子时，伏老特别摆出做父亲的神气，伸手扭住了魁伟的小伏罗希洛夫的耳朵，全场群众都愉快地大笑和欢呼起来。
    这种融洽的像至亲友好一样的气氛，一直充满在伏老和印度尼西亚人民中间。伏老满面红光，衬着一头银发，谈笑风生，更加显得慈祥温厚了。伏老常常亲切地同印度尼西亚人民谈话，同青年人一起唱歌，使印度尼西亚人民毫无拘束地同他在一起，像同一个普通的老伯伯一样。所以有些印度尼西亚人就把伏老的名字叫成“Moro Silo”。这两个印度尼西亚字的含义是：“盘膝而坐，亲切交谈”。有两个印度尼西亚的农妇，一个八十多岁，一个九十岁了，她们拉住伏老的手，就把这位七十六岁高龄的元帅和主席叫做“我的年青的兄弟”，叮嘱他当心身体。
    印度尼西亚人民这样热烈欢迎伏老，是很容易理解的。因为他们知道苏联是他们真正的朋友。苏联坚决支持印度尼西亚人民反对殖民主义，支持印度尼西亚人民争取独立的斗争，并对保卫世界和平有着出色的贡献，这是印度尼西亚人民非常喜爱和尊重的。
    苏加诺总统在雅加达的印度尼西亚和苏联友好大会上的讲话，非常恰当地表达了印度尼西亚人民的这种心情。苏加诺说：“印度尼西亚的母亲抱着孩子在路旁、甚至在大雨中高呼‘伏老万岁’，为什么？这不仅是为了和平，而且是为了热爱独立，因为在我们争取独立的斗争中，苏联一直站在我们一边，支持我们。有人自称他们是印度尼西亚的朋友，但他们却在我国进行颠复活动；有人说他们是印度尼西亚的朋友，却不肯把西伊里安交还我们”。苏加诺说，如果不承认我们民族的愿望，就不是我们真正的朋友；即使给我们像尼加拉瓜瀑布一样倾泻的美元，我们也不会满足。
    苏加诺几次演讲中一再指出，印度尼西亚和苏联两国的制度虽然不同，但是可以和平共处，而且可以成为好朋友。他希望印度尼西亚和苏联两国之间的友谊得到巩固和发展，以至永远。伏老对苏加诺的看法，也一再表示同意。
    当然，帝国主义是害怕和敌视苏联同印度尼西亚之间的这种友好关系的发展的。在伏老访问期间，他们一直企图进行扰乱和制造不愉快事件。他们所扶植的非法武装“伊斯兰教军”，曾筹划在伏老去万隆途中进行袭击，并阴谋破坏某些地方的欢迎活动。美国大使馆武官处的人员，竟亲自出马半夜偷掉雅加达官方为欢迎伏老而挂起来的苏联和印度尼西亚国旗。但印度尼西亚的政府和军队是警觉的，印度尼西亚人民的眼睛是雪亮的，破坏分子往往在还没成事的时候就被监视了和被检举了。而企图武装袭击的匪徒，也在伏老去万隆的前二天，就被政府的军队所全部歼灭了。偷旗的美国人逃得虽快，但三个印度尼西亚青年却在他背后紧紧追赶，终于把他捉送警察局，美国驻印度尼西亚大使不得不道歉认错，丢尽了面子。
    现在，伏老已经愉快和顺利地完成了对印度尼西亚的友好访问。在这短短的十三天里，印度尼西亚和苏联两国领袖和人民之间的了解和友谊，都得到了进一步的增长。伏老在离开雅加达时的告别词中说：“苏联和印度尼西亚两国人民的友谊，将成为牢不可破的友谊！”这时，成千成万送别贵宾的印度尼西亚人民立刻迸发响彻云霄的回答：“是的，牢不可破！”而苏加诺的答复是：“印度尼西亚人民对苏联人民的兄弟般的友好的心，是永远不可改变的！”这准确地表达了印度尼西亚和苏联人民之间的深厚的友谊，也是给帝国主义的一个响亮的回答。
