Xinhua News Agency, Changsha Telegram: The Hunan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently held a provincial education work conference, focusing on studying the arrangements for further education and employment of primary and secondary school graduates, as well as political and ideological education.

The conference decided to conduct patient and meticulous career education and labor education for graduating students in a more concentrated manner, encouraging students to earnestly prepare for both further education and participation in labor production. At the same time, it was decided that the Party committees at all levels would be responsible for organizing forces to carry out several large-scale publicity campaigns in cities and rural areas throughout the province in the form of reports and discussions, explaining the rationale to students, parents, and people from all walks of life, and striving to make it known to every household in the cities. It is required to form correct public opinion through this publicity campaign.

The conference requested that under the leadership of the local Party committees, county committees, and municipal committees of the Chinese Communist Party, relevant departments should form middle school graduate further education and employment guidance groups, immediately begin to conduct thorough investigations and assessments of students, plan and guide self-study and tutoring for students who have not been admitted, and conduct employment surveys in the handicraft and service industries in cities and towns to have a clear understanding, so as to mobilize students who have not been admitted to participate in production and self-study in a planned way.

The conference believes that running remedial classes and schools for graduates of senior primary schools in cities has initially gained experience, and currently more than 10,000 students (including some junior high school graduates) are participating in remedial studies. Eighteen counties and cities throughout the province have established self-study guidance committees, and have been equipped with thirty-three full-time cadres, and have established many self-study groups. This year, these self-study remedial classes should be appropriately expanded.

    湖南对中小学毕业生进行前途教育和劳动教育
    鼓励学生做好升学和参加生产两种打算
    据新华社长沙电　中共湖南省委员会最近召开全省教育工作会议，着重研究了中小学毕业生的升学就业安排和政治思想教育问题。
    会议决定比较集中地对毕业学生进行耐心细致的前途教育和劳动教育，鼓励学生切实做好升学和参加劳动生产的两种打算。同时决定由中共各级党委负责组织力量，采取报告、座谈等方式，在全省城市和农村集中开展几次大张旗鼓的宣传工作，向学生家长和社会人士讲清道理，在城市要求做到家喻户晓。要求通过这次宣传形成正确的社会舆论。
    会议要求在中共各地委、县委、市委领导下，由有关部门组成中学毕业生升学就业指导小组，立即开始在学生中进行摸底排队，筹划指导未考取的学生自学补习事宜，并在城市集镇的手工业和服务性行业中进行就业调查，做到心中有数，以便有计划地动员未录取的学生参加生产、参加自学。
    会议认为在城市举办高小毕业生补习班和补习学校已初步取得经验，目前就有一万多学生（包括一部分初中毕业生）参加补习。全省已有十八个县、市成立了自学指导委员会，并配备了三十三名专职干部，成立了许多自学小组。今年应适当扩大这些自学补习班。
