Xinhua News Agency, Belgrade, May 25th. Yugoslav President Tito, in a conversation with the director and editor-in-chief of "Politika" on May 24th, said that from the correct perspective, it is impossible for Yugoslavia not to maintain good relations with its closest and bordering Eastern countries. Tito said that not maintaining good relations with them is also inconsistent with our principle of cooperating on an equal footing with every country that wants and is able to cooperate with us. Therefore, it is necessary for Yugoslavia to maintain good relations with Eastern countries as well, even though there are some minor differences of an ideological nature between us.

Tito emphasized that he firmly believes that there is no reason for conflict between Yugoslavia and Eastern countries, nor for a further sharpening of relations between them. He said that therefore, the leaders of Yugoslavia have decided to take the initiative in this regard and show that they do not want this conflict to intensify. He added: "We are prepared to cooperate on every issue where cooperation is possible without abandoning our principled stance."

Tito then said that he believes that the wishes of the Yugoslav leaders will be met with a response from the Soviet leaders. He said that as long as everyone continues to discuss various issues without getting angry when our opinions differ, then things will be easier. Tito said that in this respect, I am more optimistic than I was during the recent Socialist Alliance plenary session, because our point of view has already yielded results.

The director of "Politika" asked Tito what he thought of the comments made by some Western newspapers regarding the upcoming visit of Yugoslav State Secretary for National Defense Gošnjak to the Soviet Union. Tito replied that the impact of ill-intentioned comments is temporary, and one day they will stop.

Tito said that Yugoslavia's reception of various military personnel from the United States, Britain, France, and other countries is in line with Yugoslavia's foreign policy and its view of coexisting and cooperating with all countries. He asked, then why shouldn't our military leaders go to the Soviet Union if they are invited by the Soviet Union and if they can see how much progress the Soviet Union has made?

Tito continued that he had received invitations to visit Indonesia, Lebanon, Syria, Pakistan, Cambodia, Ceylon, and Thailand, and that he would probably visit some of these countries this winter. Tito pointed out that during the visit, he would try to visit Nehru and Nasser as well, and perhaps also visit Burma.

When talking about the basic content of Yugoslavia's long-term economic development plan, Tito said that the plan envisages gradually eliminating the trade deficit within a few years. He said that we are now more determined than before that our future investment policy should be based on our potential, so we should not build any large-scale new factories now, although we need these factories, but we should produce more things for broad consumption and export.

Tito stressed that the agricultural issue is the most important issue now. He said that this problem has been vigorously addressed and valuable results have been achieved, because farmers now have to take the path of solving this problem, especially the path of cooperatives and large farms. Cooperation between individual producers and collective producers in the countryside is developing. Tito emphasized that therefore, the sown area we have completed this year is larger than in any year since the end of the war.

    铁托对“政治报”社长说
    必须同苏联和东欧国家友好
    南斯拉夫将同一切国家共处和合作
    新华社贝尔格莱德25日电　据南斯拉夫通讯社报道，南斯拉夫总统铁托5月24日同“政治报”社长兼总编辑进行谈话时说，从正确的角度来看，南斯拉夫不同它的最接近的和同它接壤的东方国家保持良好关系是不可能的。铁托说，不同它们保持良好关系也是不符合我们同每一个希望和我们合作而且又可能合作的国家在平等的基础上进行合作的原则的。因此，南斯拉夫有必要也和东方国家保持良好的关系，虽然我们之间存在着某些属于意识形态性质的不大的分歧。
    铁托强调说，他深信，南斯拉夫和东方国家有冲突以及它们之间的关系进一步尖锐化是没有道理的。他说，因此，南斯拉夫的领导人决定在这方面采取主动并且表明他们并不希望这种冲突尖锐化。他又说：“我们准备在不放弃我们的原则立场的情况下在每一个可能合作的问题上进行合作。”
    铁托然后说，他相信南斯拉夫领导人的愿望会得到苏联领导人的反应。他说，只要在我们的意见不一致的时候，大家仍然不带火气地讨论各种问题，那末事情就好办。铁托说，在这一方面，我比我在最近社会主义联盟全体会议期间更加乐观，因为我们的这个观点已经取得结果。
      “政治报”社长问铁托对于某些西方报纸就南斯拉夫国防国务秘书长戈什尼亚克即将访问苏联一事发表的评论抱有什么看法，铁托回答说，不怀好意的评论的影响是短暂的，有一天它们会停止的。
    铁托说，南斯拉夫接待美国、英国、法国和其他国家的各种军事人员，这是符合南斯拉夫的外交政策，符合南斯拉夫对于同一切国家共处和合作的看法的。他问，那末，如果我们的军事领导人被苏联邀请，如果他们能够去看看苏联取得了多大进展，他们为什么不可以去苏联呢？
    铁托接着说，他已经接到访问印度尼西亚、黎巴嫩、叙利亚、巴基斯坦、柬埔寨、锡兰和泰国的邀请，他大概可能在今年冬季访问其中的一些国家。铁托指出，在访问期间，无论如何他要设法也拜访一下尼赫鲁和纳赛尔，或许还要访问缅甸。
    铁托在谈到南斯拉夫经济发展远景计划的基本内容时说，这项计划预定在几年的时间内逐步消除对外贸易的逆差。他说，现在我们比以前更坚决地认为，我们今后的投资政策应该以我们的潜力为基础，因此我们现在不要建设任何大规模的新工厂，虽然我们需要这些工厂，但是我们要生产更多的东西供广大的消费和出口之用。
    铁托着重指出，农业问题是现在最重要的问题。他说，这个问题已经在大力设法解决，并且已经取得可贵的结果，因为农民们现在也不得不走解决这个问题的道路，特别是合作社和大型农场的道路。乡村的个体生产者和集体生产者之间的合作正在发展。铁托着重指出，因此，我们今年所完成的播种地区要比大战结束以后任何一年都大。
