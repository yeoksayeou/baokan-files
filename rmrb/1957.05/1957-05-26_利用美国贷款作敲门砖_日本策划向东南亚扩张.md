Xinhua News Agency, May 25th, Tokyo dispatch: According to the "Nihon Keizai Shimbun", in preparation for Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi's visit to the United States, the Japanese Foreign Ministry and the Ministry of International Trade and Industry have initially drafted a plan to request loans from the United States International Cooperation Administration (ICA) as funds for developing Southeast Asia.

According to this plan, Japan hopes to obtain approximately $4 billion in US loans over the next five years. Japan will use these funds to develop mines and provide industrial equipment in Southeast Asia, and purchase agricultural products such as rice and cotton, as well as aquatic products from Southeast Asia.

The newspaper said that the Japanese government considered that if the United States directly provided funds for the development of Southeast Asia, it would be difficult for the national sentiments of Southeast Asian countries to accept. Therefore, Japan would come forward in place of the United States, combining Japanese technology with American capital, to invigorate trade in the Southeast Asian region and expand Japanese exports.

It is reported that the Japanese government is conducting preliminary probes with the United States based on this plan, and plans to hold further discussions with the United States when Nobusuke Kishi visits Washington.

    利用美国贷款作敲门砖
    日本策划向东南亚扩张
    新华社25日讯　东京消息：据“日本经济新闻”报道，为了给岸信介首相访问美国作准备，日本外务省和通商产业省已经初步拟订向美国国际合作署要求贷款作为开发东南亚资金的方案。
    根据这个方案，日本希望在今后五年内取得美国贷款约四十亿美元。日本利用这笔资金开发东南亚的矿山和提供工业设备，并且向东南亚购买大米、棉花等农产品和水产品。
    这家报纸说，日本政府考虑到如果美国出面提供开发东南亚的资金，很难为东南亚各国的民族感情所接受。因此，由日本代替美国出面，通过日本技术和美国资本的结合，来活跃东南亚地区的贸易，扩大日本的输出。
    据报道，日本政府正在根据这个方案向美国作初步试探，并且计划在岸信介访问华盛顿的时候，和美国作进一步的商谈。
