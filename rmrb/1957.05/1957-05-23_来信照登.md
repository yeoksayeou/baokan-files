Letters to the Editor

The record of my speech at the symposium of responsible persons from democratic parties in the Ministry of Foreign Trade, published on page 4 of the People's Daily on the 17th, contains several points that differ significantly from my actual speech, thus making my speech very inconsistent with the actual situation:

1.  When talking about the faster promotion of cadres in the personnel department, the example I gave was that the cadres of the "Foreign Cadre Division of the Personnel Bureau" were all first-class staff members, with no ordinary staff members. The record mistakenly states "Personnel Bureau."

2.  When talking about the issue of cadre promotion, I said: "Some companies have many general cadres who have not been promoted in four years since 1952." But the record mistakenly states: "Many companies' general cadres... haven't been promoted in four years."

3.  When talking about the issue of incompetent leading Party member cadres, I said: "Some Party member division chiefs are basically incompetent." But the record mistakenly states: "Promoted Party members are incompetent."

4.  When talking about the authority of non-Party member cadres, I said: "Members of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang (民革) branch in the Ministry of Foreign Trade who hold leadership positions (they hold positions of deputy division chief and section chief) have power and authority. However, some people say this is because the division chief knows nothing." The record mistakenly states: "Here, non-Party cadres have power and authority, which is because the division chief knows nothing."

The title of my speech and the relevant content published on page 3 of the People's Daily on the 19th regarding the symposium of industrialists and businessmen are significantly different from what I originally said. I said:

"In the study, medium and small industrialists and businessmen have two kinds of views and reactions to the two-sidedness: ① They believe that the negative side is not unique to industrialists and businessmen. Some workers and Party members are even more serious in seeking enjoyment and fame and fortune than they are. ② They believe that they are from laboring people, and in the old society, it was a society where the big fish eat the small fish, a society where people exploit people. In order to survive, they had to engage in exploitative activities, otherwise, they would be eaten. This is mainly due to the influence of the big bourgeoisie.

Because they have the above two views, they do not admit that they have two-sidedness, and believe that if there is any, everyone has it.

I think their first point of view does not recognize two-sidedness from the ideological system. The second point still has some reason. But in the current situation, the facts of speculation and seeking fame and fortune still exist. I think two-sidedness is still objectively existing."

The newspaper presented the views of medium and small industrialists and businessmen that I reflected as my opinions, which is not in accordance with the facts.

The excerpt of my speech published on page 3 of the People's Daily on the 19th in the article "The Party Group of the Ministry of Finance Invites People from Democratic Parties to a Symposium," in which the sentence "Many Party members are just eating by virtue of their Party membership" is very different from the original meaning, and should be changed to: "On the issue of promotion, some people believe that talent should be used on the basis of virtue. If only virtue is emphasized and not talent, it will easily make Party member cadres think that they can eat by virtue of their Party status, while neglecting the improvement of their own professional ability."

In addition, the "炉" (Lu) in the name Yue Lu signed should be changed to "爌" (Kuang). Please correct it accordingly.

    人民日报17日第四版所载我在对外贸易部民主党派负责人座谈会上的发言记录，其中有几点与我的发言有较大的出入，因而就使我的发言与实际情况很不符合：
    1、在谈到人事部门工作干部提拔得更快时，我举的例子是“人事局国外干部处”的干部都是一等科员，没有普通科员；记录误为“人事局”了。
    2、在谈到干部提拔问题的时候，我说的是：“有些公司有很多的一般干部，1952年以来四年没有提过级”。但记录误为“很多公司的一般干部，……四年没提过级”。
    3、在谈到党员领导干部不称职的问题时，我说的是：“有的党员处长，基本上是不称职的”。但记录误为：“提拔的党员，是不称职的。”
    4、在谈到非党员干部职权问题的时候，我说的是：“担任领导职务的民革对外贸易部支部的成员（他们担任副处长和科长的职务）是有职有权的。但是也有的人说，这是由于处长什么都不会。”记录误为：“在我们这里，非党干部是有职有权的，这是由于处长什么都不会”。　　　　　　　　　姚日澄
    人民日报19日第三版所载我在工商界座谈会上的发言，其标题和标题内容有关的内容，都同我所说的原意有很大出入。我是这样说的：
    “中、小工商业者在学习中，对两面性的看法、反映有两种情况：①他们认为消极一面不是工商业者所独有。工人、党员图享受、争名利有的比他们还严重些。②他们认为自己是劳动人民出身，在旧社会是大鱼吃小鱼、是人剥削人的社会。自己为了生存，不得不从事剥削生活，否则就会被人吃掉。这主要是受大资产阶级影响所致。
    他们由于有以上两点看法，所以不承认他们有两面性，认为要有就是大家都有。
    我认为他们第一点的看法，是没有从思想体系上来认识两面性。第二点还有几分理由。但在目前情况下，投机取巧、贪名图利的事实还存在。我认为两面性还是客观存在的。”
    报上把我的反映中、小工商业者的看法，说成是我的意见，这是不符合事实的。　　　　　　　　　　　宋莲甫
      人民日报19日第三版所载“财政部党组邀请民主党派人士座谈”一文摘登了我的一段发言，其中“有很多党员就凭着党员名义吃饭”一句与原意出入很大，应改为：“在提拔问题上，有的人认为应该是在德的基础上量才而用，如果只重德，不重才，就容易使党员干部认为可以凭党的资格吃饭，而忽视自己业务能力的提高。”
    另，署名岳炉的“炉”应改为“爌”，请一并更正。
