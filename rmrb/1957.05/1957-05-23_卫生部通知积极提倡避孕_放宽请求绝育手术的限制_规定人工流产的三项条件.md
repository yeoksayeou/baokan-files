Xinhua News Agency, May 18th -- The Ministry of Health issued a notice on artificial abortion and sterilization surgery on May 15th.

The notice begins by stating: To carry out family planning work, contraception should be actively promoted, contraceptive knowledge should be disseminated, contraceptive techniques should be strengthened, contraceptive supplies and medicines should be universally provided, and research on contraception should be carried out. Doing a good job in contraception is an active and effective method for achieving planned births and is also a method acceptable to the masses. This work should be listed as one of the important tasks of health services.

The notice then states: Since the previous notices issued by the Ministry of Health on artificial abortion and sterilization surgery came into effect, various localities have reported that the regulations were too specific, the procedures were too cumbersome, and there were difficulties in implementation; it is now decided to abolish them.

The notice re-stipulates the regulations on sterilization surgery and artificial abortion: 1. Sterilization surgery: Sterilization surgery includes ligation of the vas deferens in men or the fallopian tubes in women. If a couple requests sterilization from a doctor, and the doctor finds no contraindications for surgery, the surgery can be performed. However, since the surgery will result in permanent infertility, the applicants should be solemnly informed before the surgery. It should also be explained that the surgery will not affect sexual function. Vasectomy is simple and does not require hospitalization; it should also be explained that within one month after the surgery, residual sperm in the seminal vesicles has not yet been discharged, and contraception is still required. 2. Artificial abortion: If a woman is unwilling to continue pregnancy due to some difficulty, in order to prevent the health hazards caused by private abortions, surgery may be considered, but the following conditions must be met for requesting artificial abortion: First, the pregnancy must be within three months according to a doctor's diagnosis; second, the pregnant woman must have no contraindications for surgery according to a doctor's diagnosis; and third, artificial abortion surgery must not have been performed within twelve months. Artificial abortion surgery is harmful to women's health. If contraception is not used after the surgery, pregnancy will continue, and the purpose of family planning cannot be achieved. The public should be informed of this. Applicants should be patiently explained to and reasoned with, especially for primiparous women, who are more vulnerable to harm, and should be persuaded as much as possible to avoid surgery. Women undergoing surgery must be effectively guided in contraception to avoid repeated pregnancies.

The notice requires that local health departments and medical institutions should establish contraception guidance clinics and improve their technical level so that the public can receive good medical services. Follow-up should be conducted for contraception and sterilization surgery, and statistics and analysis should be carried out to summarize experience.

The notice concludes by stating: In the process of promoting family planning, protection of pregnant women, lying-in women, and infants must be strengthened, and the state's policy of protecting mothers and children must be conscientiously implemented.

    卫生部通知积极提倡避孕
    放宽请求绝育手术的限制
    规定人工流产的三项条件
    新华社18日讯　卫生部5月15日发出了关于人工流产及绝育手术的通知。
    通知首先说：开展节育工作应积极提倡避孕，宣传避孕知识，加强指导避孕技术，做到普遍供应避孕用具药品，和开展有关避孕的研究工作。做好避孕工作对实现有计划地生育，是积极的有效的方法，也是群众可以接受的方法。这一项工作，应列为卫生业务重要工作之一。
    通知接着说：过去卫生部发布的关于人工流产及绝育手术通知施行以来，各地反映规定太具体、手续较繁，在执行中有困难；现在决定废止。
    通知对绝育手术和人工流产重新作了规定：一、绝育手术：绝育手术包括结扎男子输精管或妇女输卵管，凡夫妇有绝育要求向医师申请的，医师检查无手术禁忌症，即可进行手术。但是手术后即永不生育，应该在手术前郑重向申请者说明。手术后不影响性机能，也应说明。结扎输精管手术简便，毋须住院；在手术后一个月内，精囊内残存精子尚未排尽，仍须使用避孕方法，也应说明。二、人工流产手术：妇女由于某种困难不愿继续妊娠，为了防止私自堕胎造成对健康的危害，可以考虑允许进行手术，但要求施行人工流产手术的，必须具备下列条件：一、经医师诊断孕期在三个月之内；二、经医师诊断孕妇没有手术禁忌症；三、十二个月内没有做过人工流产手术。人工流产手术对妇女健康有害，手术后若不采用避孕，仍会继续怀孕，并不能达到计划生育的目的，应对社会群众进行宣传。对申请者应耐心解释，讲清道理，尤其对初孕妇危害更多，应尽量说服，避免手术。对进行手术的妇女必须切实指导避孕，以免反复受孕。
    通知要求各地卫生部门医疗机构应开展避孕指导门诊，并应提高技术水平，使群众得到良好的医疗服务。对进行避孕和绝育手术等，应进行随访，做好统计分析，总结经验。
    通知最后说：在推行节育工作过程中，对孕产妇和婴幼儿必须加强保护，认真贯彻执行国家保护母亲儿童的政策。
