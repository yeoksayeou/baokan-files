    Reported in this newspaper: The Party Group of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the Chinese Communist Party recently invited members of various democratic parties and non-party individuals in the agency to a forum.
    At the meeting, some people mentioned that it was difficult for non-Party cadres to work and that they could not fully exert their initiative, the key being that they had positions without power. Wang Yuting, Deputy Director of the General Office, felt it was difficult to lead the Party member section chiefs under him, saying he was "less capable" than before. Zhang Huayun, a Party member section chief, did not ask for instructions or report to him when doing things, but instead went to another Party member deputy director for instructions. The notice for the May Day holiday was approved by him for Wang Lin, the document section chief, to handle, but Wang Lin did not implement it. Instead, he wrote a note saying, "Deputy Director Wang, please withdraw your order."
    At the meeting, many people focused on sharply criticizing the subjectivism, bureaucratism, and sectarianism of some Party members. Non-Party cadres were busy with business plans until the early hours of the morning, but two Party member specialists did not work, closed their doors to engage in creative writing, and refused to attend when invited to participate in planning. If a non-Party member engaged in creative writing, they would be said to be doing it for fame and fortune, but if a Party member engaged in creative writing, it would be said that they were doing more work for the Party. Some pointed out that Party members Yang Ming and Han Qing received salaries but did not work, engaging in a "silent strike."

    华侨事务委员会党外人士尖锐批评一些党员的作风
    本报讯　中共华侨事务委员会党组近日邀请本机关各民主党派成员及党外人士举行座谈。
    会上有人谈到，非党干部工作困难，不能充分发挥积极作用，关键在于有职无权。办公厅副主任王雨亭对所属的党员科长感到很难领导，说自己比以前“低能”了，党员科长张华云作事不向他请示报告，而向另一党员副主任去请示。五一放假的通知他批给文书科长王琳办，王琳不执行，反写了一张条子，叫“王副主任收回成命”。
    会上，不少人集中对一些党员的主观主义、官僚主义和宗派主义提出了尖锐的批评。非党干部忙业务计划忙到三更半夜，可是两个党员专员不干工作，关门搞创作，请他们来参加作计划都不来。非党员如果搞创作，就被说成是为名为利，可是党员搞创作就说为党多作工作。有人指出党员杨明、韩青领薪不工作，“静坐罢工”。
