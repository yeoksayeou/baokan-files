    Stagnation of the U.S. Economy in the First Quarter of This Year
    Zhang Zhenya
    At the end of last year, the American economic community was worried that the U.S. economy would experience a recession in the middle of this year. However, the economic phenomena in the U.S. in the first quarter of this year indicate that signs of economic stagnation appeared earlier than they expected.
    The Alarm Bell of the New York Stock Market
    The New York stock market, which is most sensitive to U.S. economic activity, sounded the alarm first. According to the monthly price average index of 50 of the most representative stocks compiled by "The New York Times," the decline in stock prices in the first quarter of this year broke the record for the decline in stocks in the first quarter since 1926. After the big drop in prices on February 5th and 11th, the trading volume of the New York stock market in March remained at the lowest level since February 1954, with the daily trading volume never exceeding two million shares. Regarding this situation, the financial columnist of "The New York Times" made a vivid analogy: "Spring has arrived according to the calendar. But it is too inconspicuous on Wall Street... The (stock) market in recent weeks has become more and more like a car with good brakes but no engine. Although it did not slide down the hillside, it also could not climb up the mountain."
    The decline in various industrial stocks on the New York stock market reflects an economic fact: the recession in the U.S. consumer goods industry has begun to affect the U.S. means of production industries.
    Originally, the decline in the New York stock market had already begun in April 1956. Industrial stocks were able to decline less last year because the stock prices of departments such as electrical equipment, steel, and heavy machinery manufacturing rose last year due to the investment boom in enterprises. However, by January of this year, the stock prices of these industrial enterprises also began to fall, which caused the big drop in prices in the entire stock market in February. Therefore, the decline in stock prices in the first quarter of this year was not the result of any accidental factors, but rather reflected the instability of the U.S. economy.
    The Pressure of Overproduction
    In the first quarter of this year, the United States experienced phenomena such as difficulties in sales for enterprises, wholesalers and retailers trying their best to reduce inventories, many industrial sectors reducing production, and a sharp increase in the number of company bankruptcies. The main reason for this phenomenon is that social consumption is far behind the expansion of productivity.
    In 1956, U.S. companies' large investments in new factories and equipment caused last year's boom. But the result was a blind expansion of production; coupled with rapid inflation, this made the contradiction between production and consumption that already existed in the U.S. economy even more acute, forming new pressure of overproduction. At present, not only durable consumer goods enterprises are overproducing, but also some non-durable consumer goods and industrial raw material departments that are not directly related to consumers are feeling the pressure in this regard. According to "The New York Times," wholesalers and retailers reduced their purchases due to sales difficulties, forcing manufacturers to cut their production as well. In February, many important departments of the U.S. daily necessities industry were therefore operating at under capacity. Production indices for items like textiles and clothing, rubber and leather products, radios and televisions, and various household items were all lower than in February of last year. Many textile factories had to switch to a five-day work week from March onwards due to excessive inventory, and other textile factories were also laying off workers or reducing daily working hours. Manufacturers of televisions and household appliances had already slowed down production in order to clear out inventory.
    Although automobile dealers have tried every means to promote new products, accumulated inventory still reached 729,000 vehicles at the end of February (the highest accumulated number since June of last year). According to recent figures released by the automotive industry, automobile sales in the first quarter of this year were 25,000 vehicles less than in the same period last year. Therefore, the automotive industry's original plan to reduce production by 4.6% in the second quarter has had to be further revised to reduce production by 1.11%.
    The housing construction, which had already begun to decline last year, is even more sluggish. The annual rate of new housing construction starts in February fell to 910,000 units, which is the lowest point since May 1949. Compared to 1.5 million units in January 1955, it has fallen by nearly 40%. It has also fallen by 18% compared to 1.1 million units in 1956. In March, it further fell to 880,000 units. This is not because the demand for housing has decreased, but because buyers cannot afford it. According to "The New York Times," it is estimated that at least 100,000 to 300,000 families in need of housing are currently excluded from the market due to the high cost of housing.
    The automotive industry and the construction industry are the steel industry's largest customers. Their production cuts cannot but affect the steel industry. The U.S. steel industry just started a three-year expansion plan last year, preparing to increase the annual output of steel production equipment capacity by 15 million tons, but in fact, this March, it produced more than 300,000 tons of steel less than in the same period last year. The largest U.S. steel company—U.S. Steel Corporation—announced in March that it had shut down one of its blast furnaces and three open-hearth furnaces. Some small steel companies also shut down some of their open-hearth furnaces. According to officially published materials, despite the fact that industries such as petroleum, chemicals, non-electrical machinery manufacturing, and papermaking increased production in the first quarter, the total U.S. industrial production index in the first quarter of this year still decreased slightly compared to December of last year.
    In this situation, the increase in the number of company bankruptcies has rapidly intensified. According to "The New York Times," the number of company bankruptcies in the U.S. in March increased by about 20% compared to the same period last year.
    Due to the poor economic situation, capitalists have become wary of corporate investment this year. In 1956, U.S. corporate investment increased by 22% compared to 1955. "Business Week" had predicted that it would increase by another 11% this year. However, the Department of Commerce and the Securities and Exchange Commission have recently revised this estimated figure to 6.5%. Capitalists' lack of confidence in the prospects of enterprises is an important sign of economic instability.
    Two Factors Maintaining Economic Activity
    Of course, these symptoms alone are not enough to confirm that the U.S. economy will begin a new crisis, or that it will not recover and rise again within this year. There are two important factors that need to be estimated here: First, the consumption of the entire U.S. society is still maintained at a relatively high level, and continues to increase. Consumer spending in the first quarter increased by $4.1 billion at an annual rate compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Since the total number of employed people increased again in March, this aspect of expenditure will also further increase. Moreover, the current contraction of the market is also partly related to the U.S. government's tight monetary policy. In the event of further economic fluctuations, the U.S. fiscal authorities can also use the method of loosening monetary policy to stimulate market purchasing power. Second, huge government spending is still an important factor in maintaining U.S. economic activity. The U.S. government still has a certain amount of leeway in this regard.
    In view of the sluggishness of corporate capital investment, housing construction, and the durable consumer goods industry this year, the U.S. government is preparing to use government spending to give the U.S. economy a shot in the arm. "U.S. News & World Report" magazine has already publicized that if enterprises spend $12 billion less on factory equipment and raw materials this year, a crisis will not occur. This is because the federal government will increase its expenditure by $4.6 billion this year, and state and local governments will also increase their expenditure by $2.5 to $3 billion as usual. This can make up for two-thirds of the above-mentioned gap. In addition, after an economic recession occurs, the government will also drastically increase its spending.
    However, the basic laws of capitalist economic development are ultimately decisive. Years of enterprise investment fever have greatly expanded productivity. Although social consumption has increased, the demand of society with purchasing power is far behind the increase in production. Some basic industries have experienced overproduction, and the intervals of production development are becoming more and more frequent. These all reflect the increasing sharpness of the contradiction between production and consumption. The government's policy is nothing more than stimulating the activity of capital investment and creating some false purchasing power for the market. It can only temporarily affect the development of contradictions, and its role is limited. Exceeding the limit will instead promote a crisis. U.S. Treasury Secretary Humphrey said: "When the economy is on a downward slope, the government can certainly increase some of its expenditures, but this emergency expenditure must be kept within reasonable limits and not shake people's trust in the government's responsibility." The problem is that both increasing government spending continuously to maintain market demand and keeping this spending within reasonable limits, from the situation of the past few years, is becoming an increasingly difficult thing to do.

### 今年第一季度美国经济的停滞

    今年第一季度美国经济的停滞
    张振亚
    去年年底美国经济界就担心今年年中美国的经济会发生衰退。但是今年第一季度美国的经济现象表明，经济停滞迹象出现得比他们预期的为早。
    纽约股票市场的警钟
    对美国经济活动最敏感的纽约股票市场首先响起了警钟。根据“纽约时报”所编的五十种最具有代表性的股票的每月价格平均指数计算，今年第一季度股票价格的下落幅度打破了1926年以来股票在第一季度下落的纪录。在今年2月5日和11日的大跌价以后，纽约股票市场的交易额在3月份一直停留于1954年2月以来的最低数字，每日的交易额从未超过二百万股。关于这种情况，“纽约时报”的金融专栏作者曾经作了一个生动的比喻：“春天按照日历的时刻来到了。但是在华尔街却太不明显……（股票）市场在最近几周中越来越像一辆有好的刹车可是没有引擎的汽车。它虽没有从山坡上滑下来，但也爬不上山去”。
    纽约股票市场上各种工业股票的下跌情况反映了一个经济事实：美国消费品工业的不景气已经开始影响到美国生产资料工业部门。
    原来纽约股票市场的跌风从1956年4月起就已开始。工业股票去年能够下跌幅度不大，是因为电气设备、钢铁和重型机器制造这些部门的股票价格在去年企业投资景气下有所上升。但是到今年1月，这类工业企业股票价格也开始下跌，于是引起了整个股票市场2月份的大跌价。因此今年第一季度股票价格的下跌不是什么偶发因素的结果，而是反映了美国经济的不稳定。
    生产过剩的压力
    今年第一季度，美国出现了企业售货困难、批发和零售商竭力减少存货、许多工业部门缩减生产、公司倒闭数字急剧上升等现象。所以发生这种现象，主要原因是社会消费远赶不上生产力的扩大。
    1956年美国企业对新工厂和设备的大量投资，造成了去年的景气。但结果却盲目地扩大了生产；再加上急剧的通货膨胀，就使得美国经济中早就存在的生产和消费之间的矛盾更加尖锐起来，形成了新的生产过剩的压力。目前不仅耐用消费品企业生产过剩，而且一些非耐用消费品和同消费者不直接发生关系的工业原料部门也感受到这方面的压力。据“纽约时报”报道，批发商和零售商因销售困难而减少进货，迫使制造商也不得不削减他们的生产。2月份美国许多日用品工业的重要部门因此开工不足。像纺织品和衣服、橡胶和皮革制品、收音机和电视机、以及各种家庭用品的生产指数都比去年2月为低。很多纺织厂因存货过多不得不从3月起改为每周五天工作制，其他一些纺织厂也在裁减工人或减少每天工作时间。电视机和家庭用具制造商早已放慢生产，以便撤清存货。
    汽车商虽然想尽办法推销新产品，但是2月底积压存货仍然达到七十二万九千辆（去年6月以来的最高积压数字）。根据最近汽车业发表的数字，今年第一季的汽车销售量比去年同期少二万五千辆。因此汽车业原订在第二季减产4.6％的计划，已不得不进一步改为减产1.11％。
    去年就已经开始下降的住房建筑，情况更加疲塌。2月份新住房建筑的动工年率数字跌到九十一万所，即降到1949年5月以来的最低点。同1955年1月的一百五十万所相比，下跌近40％。比1956年的一百一十万所也下跌了18％。3月份更下跌到八十八万所。这不是因为房屋需求已少，而是因为购买者买不起。据“纽约时报”估计，目前至少有十万到三十万个需要房屋的家庭因房屋造价昂贵而被排出市场之外。
    汽车业和建筑业是钢铁工业的最大主顾。它们的减产不能不影响到钢铁业。美国钢铁工业在去年刚刚开始了一个三年扩充计划，准备把钢铁生产设备能力的年产量增加一千五百万吨，可是实际上，今年3月却比去年同期减产三十多万吨钢。美国最大的钢铁企业——美国钢铁公司在三月份已宣布关掉了它的一个高炉和三个平炉。一些小钢铁公司也关掉它们的一部分平炉。据官方发表的材料，尽管石油、化学、非电力机器制造和造纸等工业在第一季度的生产有所增加，今年第一季美国工业生产总指数仍然比去年12月下降了一点。
    在这种情况下，公司倒闭数字的增加就迅速加剧起来。据“纽约时报”透露，3月份美国公司倒闭数字比去年同期增加了约20％。
    由于经济状况不佳，资本家对今年企业投资已有了戒心。1956年美国的企业投资比1955年增加了22％。“商业周刊”曾预测今年将再提高11％。但是最近商务部和证券交易委员会已把这个估计数字修改为6.5％。资本家对于企业前景信心不足，是经济不稳定的一个重要迹象。
    两个维持经济活动的因素
    当然，仅是上述这些症候还不能够肯定美国的经济就会开始一次新的危机，或者说在今年以内不会再恢复上升。这里有两个需要估计的重要因素：一，美国整个社会的消费仍然维持在相当高的水平，而且续有增加。第一季度消费者支出的年率比去年第四季增加了四十一亿美元。由于3月份总的就业人数又有增加，这方面的支出也还会进一步增大。而且，目前市场的收缩，部分也同美国政府实行的紧缩银根政策有关。在经济进一步波动的情况下，美国财政当局还可以用放松银根的办法，刺激市场购买力。二，巨额的政府开支仍然是维持美国经济活动的重要因素。美国政府在这方面仍然有一定的回旋余地。
    鉴于今年企业资本投资、房屋建筑和耐用消费品工业的不振，美国政府正在准备运用政府开支来为美国经济打强心针。“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志已经宣传说，如果今年各企业在工厂设备和购进原料上少花一百二十亿美元，也不会出现危机。因为联邦政府今年将增加四十六亿美元的支出，州和地方政府也照例要增加二十五到三十亿美元的支出。这就可以弥补上述缺口的三分之二。此外，在经济衰退出现以后，政府还会使它的花费急剧增加。
    但是，资本主义经济发展的基本规律终究是决定性的。几年来的企业投资热，已经使得生产力大为扩充。社会消费虽有增长，但社会有支付能力的需求远赶不上生产的增加。一些基本工业已出现生产过剩，而且生产发展的间歇愈来愈频繁。这些都反映了生产和消费两者之间的矛盾的日趋尖锐。政府的政策不外是刺激资本投资的活动和为市场造成某种虚假的购买力。它只能暂时影响矛盾的发展，其作用是有限度的，超过限度，反而会促进危机。美国财政部长汉弗来就说过：“在经济走下坡的时候，政府当然可以增加它的某些开支，但是这种应急性的支出必须保持于合理限度之内，并使其不致动摇人们对政府责任的信任。”问题在于，既要以不断增加政府支出来维持市场需求，又要使这种支出保持在合理限度之内，这从过去几年的情况看来，却是一件愈来愈不容易的事情。
