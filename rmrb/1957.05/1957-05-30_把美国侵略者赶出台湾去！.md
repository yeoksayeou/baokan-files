Drive the American Aggressors Out of Taiwan!
Xie Xuehong, Chairman of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League

American imperialism is the mortal enemy of the Chinese people. The crime of American imperialism attempting to invade Taiwan has a history of one hundred years. In 1867, the U.S. Navy, under the pretext of American sailors being killed, launched an armed attack on Taiwan, but was defeated by the Chinese people at that time. During the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, the United States was an accomplice of the Japanese aggressors and actively encouraged Japan to seize Taiwan, causing Taiwan to fall as a colony of Japanese imperialism for half a century, making the people of Taiwan live a tragic life of colonial slavery for a long time. After the end of World War II in 1945, the people of Taiwan thanked the Soviet people and the Soviet Red Army for defeating Japanese imperialism and helping the Chinese people recover their territory of Taiwan, making it possible for the people of Taiwan to return to the warm embrace of their motherland.

However, from this time on, American imperialism began to invade Taiwan through the Chiang Kai-shek Group, building air and naval bases in Taiwan, and gradually controlling Taiwan's political, economic, and military aspects. The wealth that the Chinese people had seized from the Japanese invaders was gradually plundered by the American invaders. Under the barbarous plunder and cruel exploitation of American imperialism, the life of the people of Taiwan was even more miserable than during the Japanese rule.

On February 28, 1947, the people of Taiwan, in order to oppose the aggression of American imperialism and the traitorous crimes of the Chiang Kai-shek Group, launched a heroic struggle on a province-wide scale, and once defeated the local regime of Chiang Kai-shek, but were temporarily defeated by the barbarous suppression of the United States and Chiang Kai-shek. In this heroic "February 28th" Uprising, about 30,000 people of Taiwan were slaughtered by the enemy.

In 1949, when the people of Taiwan celebrated the victory of the revolution in the motherland and joyfully prepared to return to the embrace of the motherland to build a free and happy socialist society together with the people of the whole country, the U.S. government actually shielded the Chiang Kai-shek Group in Taiwan as a counter-revolutionary base, and in June 1950, when the United States launched the war of aggression against Korea, it actually ordered the U.S. Navy and Air Force to invade and occupy Taiwan by force.

Since then, for the past seven years, the American aggressors have directly or instructed the Chiang Kai-shek Group to continuously create tension in the Taiwan Strait, undermine peace in the Far East, and take all despicable means to conspire to undermine China's construction and overthrow the people's democratic regime of the People's Republic of China.

For several years, the American aggressors have been creating conspiracies such as "United Nations trusteeship of Taiwan," "neutralization of Taiwan," "independent state of Taiwan," and "two Chinas," attempting to occupy Taiwan forever. In December 1954, it even signed a so-called "mutual defense treaty" with the Chiang Kai-shek Group, attempting to legalize its armed invasion of Taiwan and attempting to use Taiwan as a base to expand its aggression against China and prepare for a new war.

Taiwan under the aggression of American imperialism has become a living hell of darkness. The suffering of the people is indescribable and unbelievable. Among the eight million residents, there are one million poor people who cannot maintain the most basic life. They rely on begging or picking up moldy food in the garbage to fill their hunger in order to avoid death. Because they cannot live, many people auction off their beloved children, many people commit suicide or their whole family commits suicide, many people go crazy, and many people starve to death.

The thousands of American soldiers who occupy Taiwan are even more rampant and commit all kinds of evil, further causing the people of Taiwan to have no guarantee of life or property. Barbarous American soldiers arbitrarily beat, kill, and rape women everywhere, constantly threatening the lives of the people of Taiwan. In Taichung, a woman named Chen Lina was raped by an American soldier and committed suicide by taking poison in grief and indignation. American military vehicles rampage everywhere, and the number of traffic accidents is almost the highest record in the world. In the first half of 1956 alone, more than 1,500 people were killed or injured in traffic accidents in Taiwan. American soldiers also extort and rob people of their property and rape women in cities and villages. They are simply beastly robbers, and their crimes are endless.

Ignoring the appeals of peace-loving people all over the world to stop nuclear and thermonuclear weapon tests and ban nuclear and thermonuclear weapons, the U.S. government announced at the beginning of this month that it would station American air force units equipped with missiles in Taiwan, which is Chinese territory. This is a serious provocative act by the U.S. government to further invade China and intensify the tense situation in the Far East. The people of Taiwan, like the people of the whole country, feel extremely indignant about this.

Just when the people of the whole province of Taiwan were indignant at the countless crimes of the American aggressors and felt that they could no longer tolerate it, the incident of American soldiers shooting and killing Liu Ziran occurred again in March, and the American military court actually declared the murderer not guilty. At this time, the people of Taipei City broke out in a patriotic anti-American demonstration. Angry thousands of people destroyed the "American Embassy" and the United States Information Service in Taiwan, and launched a struggle against all American aggressor organizations in Taiwan. The people of the entire province of Taiwan immediately united to launch an anti-American struggle.

We believe that this anti-American demonstration by the people of Taiwan is patriotic, just, and necessary. In the face of the barbaric provocations of the barbaric American aggressors, it is righteous and reasonable for the people of Taiwan to unite to resist. When the patriotic anti-American struggle of the people of Taiwan broke out, the Chiang Kai-shek Group in Taiwan not only did not support the people's struggle and demand punishment for the murderer, but instead apologized to the United States and begged for mercy under the pressure of the American aggressors, showing no national integrity. Afterwards, they arrested the patriotic people who participated in the anti-American struggle. The people of Taiwan disagree with and will never allow such a slavish attitude and anti-people behavior of the Chiang Kai-shek Group. We believe that all patriots in Taiwan should unite and drive the barbaric American aggressors out of Taiwan. Tell the American aggressors that you kill Chinese people on Chinese territory and demand compensation from the Chinese people. That is reversing right and wrong. You will only get out of Taiwan, and the Chinese people will give up!

Taiwan is an inseparable part of the sacred territory of the People's Republic of China, and the people of Taiwan are a part of the Chinese nation. The Chinese people resolutely oppose the American aggression against Taiwan, Chinese territory. The Chinese people must liberate Taiwan. This is the firm will of the 600 million Chinese people, and it is also the unanimous and ardent desire of the people of Taiwan Province who are currently in suffering. The historical fact that Taiwan is Chinese territory is undeniable, and the will of the entire Chinese people to liberate Taiwan is unshakable.

The people of Taiwan have a revolutionary tradition of opposing imperialist aggression and have a glorious history of decades of anti-aggression struggle against imperialism. The people of Taiwan are determined to unite with the people of the whole country to fight together to drive the American aggressors out of Taiwan and to realize the peaceful reunification of the great motherland—the liberation of Taiwan.

The people of the world, especially the Soviet people, have expressed their cordial condolences and warm support for this patriotic anti-American struggle of the people of Taiwan, which makes us feel extremely excited and encouraged. As a Chinese person who grew up in Taiwan, I am willing to express my heartfelt respect and gratitude to the people of the world, especially the Soviet people, on behalf of all the people of Taiwan.

This patriotic anti-American struggle of the people of Taiwan is a part of the worldwide struggle against American aggression and expansion. We fully believe that with the enthusiastic support and solidarity of the people of the whole country and the peace-loving people of the world, the anti-American struggle of the people of Taiwan will surely achieve a great victory, and Taiwan will surely be liberated.

    把美国侵略者赶出台湾去！
    台湾民主自治同盟主席　谢雪红
    美帝国主义是中国人民的死敌。美帝国主义企图侵占台湾的罪行已经有一百年的历史。1867年美国海军就曾经借口美国水手被害武装进攻台湾，但被当时中国人民所打败。1894—1895年中日战争时，美国是日本侵略者的帮凶，并且积极鼓励日本夺取台湾，造成台湾沦陷为日本帝国主义殖民地达半个世纪，使台湾人民长期过着殖民地奴隶的悲惨生活。1945年第二次大战结束后，台湾人民感谢苏联人民和苏联红军击败了日本帝国主义，帮助中国人民收回了自己的领土台湾，使台湾人民有可能重新回到自己祖国的温暖怀抱。
    可是从这时起，美国帝国主义就通过蒋介石集团开始侵略台湾，在台湾建设空军、海军基地，逐步对台湾的政治、经济和军事各方面加以控制，中国人民从日本侵略者手里夺回来的财富又逐渐被美国侵略者掠夺了。台湾人民在美帝国主义野蛮掠夺和残酷剥削下，生活比日本统治时期更加凄惨了。
    1947年2月28日，台湾人民为反对美帝国主义的侵略和蒋介石集团的卖国罪行，曾经掀起了全省规模的英勇斗争，曾经击溃了蒋介石的地方政权，可是遭到美国和蒋介石的野蛮镇压而暂时失败了。台湾人民在这次英勇的“二·二八”起义中被敌人屠杀了三万人左右。
    1949年，当台湾人民庆祝祖国的革命胜利，欢欣鼓舞地准备回到祖国怀抱同全国人民一起建设自由、幸福的社会主义社会的时候，美国政府竟包庇蒋介石集团在台湾作为反革命基地，而且在1950年6月美国发动侵朝战争的同时，它竟命令美国海、空军武装侵占了台湾。
    从此七年来，美国侵略者直接或指使蒋介石集团在台湾海峡不断制造紧张局势，破坏远东和平，并采取一切卑鄙的手段，阴谋破坏中国的建设，推翻中华人民共和国的人民民主政权。
    美国侵略者几年来一直制造“联合国托管台湾”“台湾中立化”
  “台湾独立国”“两个中国”等等阴谋，企图永远侵占台湾。1954年12月，竟又同蒋介石集团签订了所谓“共同防御条约”，企图使它武装侵略台湾的行为合法化，并企图以台湾为基地扩大对中国的侵略和准备新的战争。
    在美帝国主义侵略下的台湾已成为一座暗无天日的活地狱。人民的痛苦是无法形容的，令人难于相信的。在八百万居民中已经无法维持最起码生活的贫民就有一百万人，他们依靠讨饭或者在垃圾中捡些霉腐的食物充饥才能免于死亡。因为不能生活，许多人拍卖自己亲爱的儿女，许多人自杀或全家自杀，许多人发疯了，许多人饿死了。
    几千个侵占台湾的美军士兵更是横行霸道，无恶不作，更加造成台湾人民的生命、财产的毫无保障。野蛮的美国兵到处随便打人、杀人、奸淫妇女，随时都威胁着台湾人民的生命。在台中一个名叫陈丽娜的妇人遭到美国兵的强奸，心情悲愤而服毒自杀了。美军车辆到处横冲直撞，车祸之多几乎是世界的最高纪录。仅仅1956年上半年在台湾因车祸死伤者就有一千五百多人。美国兵又在城市乡村敲诈、抢劫人民财物，强奸妇女，简直是兽性的强盗，他们的罪行是说不完的。
    美国政府不顾全世界爱好和平人民的呼吁的停止原子核和热核爆炸试验、禁止原子核和热核武器，竟在本月初宣布要在中国的领土台湾驻扎装备导弹的美国空军部队，这是美国政府进一步侵略中国，加剧远东紧张局势的一项严重挑衅行为，台湾人民同全国人民一样地对此感到极大的愤慨。
    就在全台湾省人民愤慨美国侵略者的无数罪行，觉得无法再容忍下去的时候，于3月间又再发生了美国兵枪杀刘自然的事件，而且美国军事法庭竟宣布这个凶犯无罪。这时台北市人民爆发了爱国反美大示威，愤怒的千万群众捣毁了在台湾的“美国大使馆”和美国新闻处，并向美国侵略者所有在台湾的机关展开了斗争，全台湾省人民立即都团结起来展开了反美斗争。
    我们认为台湾人民这次反美大示威是爱国的，正当的，必要的，对待野蛮的美国侵略者的野蛮挑衅，台湾人民团结起来进行反抗是正义的、合理的。在台湾的蒋介石集团当台湾人民爱国反美斗争爆发后，不但没有支持人民的斗争，要求惩罚杀人凶手，反而在美国侵略者的压力之下向美国道歉求饶，表现毫无民族气节，之后又大肆逮捕参加反美斗争的爱国人民。对于蒋介石集团这种奴颜婢膝的态度和反人民的行为，台湾人民是不同意的，也决不容许的。我们认为在台湾的一切爱国人士都应该团结起来，把野蛮的美国侵略者从台湾赶出去。告诉美国侵略者，你们在中国的领土上杀死中国人，又要中国人赔偿，那是颠倒是非的，你们只有滚出台湾去，中国人民才能罢休！
    台湾是中华人民共和国神圣领土的一部分，台湾人民就是中国民族的一部分。中国人民坚决反对美国侵略中国领土台湾，中国人民一定要解放台湾，这是六万万中国人民坚定的意志，也是目前在苦难中的台湾省人民的一致热烈的愿望。台湾是中国的领土的历史事实是不可否认的，全中国人民解放台湾的意志是不可动摇的。
    台湾人民有着反对帝国主义侵略的革命传统，并且有着几十年同帝国主义进行反侵略斗争的光荣历史，台湾人民坚决要同全国人民一道，为把美国侵略者赶出台湾去，为实现和平统一伟大祖国——解放台湾而共同奋斗。
    全世界人民，特别是苏联人民对这次台湾人民的爱国反美斗争表示亲切的慰问和热烈的声援，使我们感到万分的兴奋和鼓舞，作为一个在台湾生长的中国人民的我，愿意代表全体台湾人民向全世界人民，特别是苏联人民表示衷心的敬意和感谢。
    台湾人民这次的爱国反美斗争，是全世界反对美国侵略扩张的斗争的一部分，我们完全相信，有着全国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民热烈支持和声援，台湾人民的反美斗争是必定会得到伟大的胜利的，台湾是必定要解放的。
              1957年5月29日
