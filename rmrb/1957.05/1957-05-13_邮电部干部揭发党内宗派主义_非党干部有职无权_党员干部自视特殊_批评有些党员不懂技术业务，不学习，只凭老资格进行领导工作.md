Postal and Telecommunications Ministry Cadre Exposes Party Factionalism
Non-Party Cadres Have Title Without Authority, Party Cadres See Themselves as Special
Criticizes Some Party Members for Not Understanding Technical Skills, Not Studying, and Leading Work Based Only on Seniority

(Our Newspaper's Report) In order to absorb opinions from outside the Party and smoothly carry out the rectification movement, the Party Group of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, according to the instructions of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, began at the end of last month to adopt small-scale symposiums, individual heart-to-heart talks, and other methods to examine and expose the problems existing in the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications' cooperative relationships. During the inspection, many non-Party cadres were in high spirits. Some people, based on their personal experiences, stated: "I still have a title and authority," and "In some places, the relationship between the Party and the masses is basically normal." At the same time, more people frankly and sharply criticized the factionalist ideology and work style of the Party organizations and some Party members in the postal and telecommunications departments.

Is it the Minister Leading the Section Chief?
Or the Section Chief Leading the Minister?

The key problem is that non-Party cadres in responsible positions cannot actively and conscientiously play their due role because they have title and responsibility but no authority. Some people believe that the specific manifestations of the non-Party minister's lack of power in the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications are that many ministerial meetings are just formalities, there is no distinction between Party and government, the Party Group replaces the work of the administration, and some issues that do not need to be discussed at Party Group meetings are also discussed at Party Group meetings. There are many things that could be made known to the non-Party minister in advance, but the non-Party minister does not know, while the Party member department and bureau directors know. Therefore, some ministerial meetings, the Party member department and bureau directors are not interested in attending and only send secretaries. Someone said: Party member responsible cadres do not respect Minister Zhu Xuefan enough. Some issues are not decided by the non-Party minister but by the Party member section chief. For example, regarding the establishment of an education section, Minister Zhu had already approved it, but the communist party member Deputy Section Chief of the Labor and Wage Department disagreed, and as a result, it was not established; another example is that during the "Three-Anti" campaign, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications decided to expel a cadre, Minister Zhu did not agree, but the communist party member Deputy Director of the Supervision Office insisted on expulsion, and in the end, the expulsion went through. Whose authority is greater? Who leads whom? Someone said: Some issues are signed by the Party member Vice Minister first and then handed to Minister Zhu; someone said: Once, Minister Zhu made a summary report at a bureau director meeting, reading from a script. After reading, he added his personal opinions. Why wasn't his opinion included in the general summary report? Someone said: Non-Party bureau directors do not dare to boldly handle problems, they have to see the attitude of the Party member bureau directors, and only dare to act after the Party member bureau directors nod. Someone said: A non-Party first deputy director of the Postal Administration approved an official document, even had it printed, but the Party member second deputy director wanted to withdraw it, and some issues were not even discussed with him before being re-approved. Someone else said: Party member general cadres also do not respect non-Party leading cadres enough, believing that they cannot solve problems, so they rarely ask them for instructions or report to them. More people generally stated the fact that when the opinions of Party members and non-Party members differ, regardless of who is right, the opinion of the Party member prevails. Even if the opinions are the same, the effect is different after they are expressed. A chief engineer believes that the non-Party cadres' guest mentality is brought about by the Party members. He criticized the Party member leading cadres' use of him as "summoned when needed, dismissed when not." He gave an example: When I am asked to go to a meeting, I don't know where I'm going or what I'm going to do beforehand. Sometimes they don't let us speak when we get there, so how can we establish a sense of ownership?

The situation of non-Party leading cadres having title and responsibility but no authority has caused losses to the work. Someone gave the following example: The Hangzhou Telecommunications Bureau proposed a rationalization suggestion to trial-produce a small switchboard. At that time, two non-Party deputy directors and one non-Party deputy section chief of the Long-Distance Telecommunications Administration decided to improve and upgrade the rationalization suggestion from Hangzhou and trial-use it at the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau. However, a Party member section chief disagreed and rudely said it was "innovation for the sake of innovation." Later, this Party member section chief led a work group out to develop a set of their own. After returning to the ministry, they spent more than 300,000 yuan to set up ten switchboards and send them to various bureaus for use, but some could not be used, and even those that could be used did not work well.

Contact with the Party's Policies is Warm
Contact with Party Members is Cold

Some people believe that the general situation in the cooperation between the Party and non-Party members in the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications is: a polite relationship, not a sincere relationship, peaceful coexistence, mutual respect as guests, not face-to-face, heart-to-heart. This makes many non-Party people feel that "contact with the Party's policies is warm, and contact with Party members is cold." Someone gave the following example: Non-Party members can argue heatedly with other non-Party members when they have different opinions in their work. However, when discussing work with Party members, even if there are different opinions, there is no argument; Party and non-Party cadres only have a working relationship. Once out of the office, Party members go with Party members, and non-Party members go with non-Party members; Non-Party cadres and Party cadres have lived in the same courtyard for five or six years without any interaction; Some non-Party comrades turn around and leave when they meet Party comrades on the road. Why is this situation formed? Some people have made an analysis, they said: Non-Party members are worried about making friends with Party members, they are afraid of saying the wrong thing, bringing up politics, and being punished in the future. Others gave examples from the anti-rightist campaign: A non-Party comrade usually likes to say strange things and has no other problems, but he was criticized during the anti-rightist campaign, saying that his strange talk was dissatisfaction with the Party, dissatisfaction with the Party meant standing on the side of the counter-revolution, standing on the side of the counter-revolution meant hoping for Chiang Kai-shek to return, which meant being a counter-revolutionary. So who would dare to associate with Party members? When talking about this issue, many people also criticized some Party members' ideological work style of being "full of arrogance" and "overbearing." Therefore, they believe that this is also the reason why non-Party cadres dare not approach Party members. Someone said: Although the words "Communist Party member" are not written on the faces of Party members, you can tell that some people are Party members at first glance, because they are neither section chiefs nor office directors, but they can scold people casually; someone said: Whoever ignores people becomes a Party member. A worker was overbearing and had a bad temper, and people said he was a Party member.

In addition, some people criticized some Party members' seniority mentality, believing that these people do not understand technology, do not understand business, have low cultural levels, do not study hard, and have poor political studies. In the future, they can only rely on history and seniority to lead.

Unfair Treatment, Party Members are Special

Non-Party members and Party members cannot enjoy equal treatment in issues such as evaluation of grades and salaries, arrangements for use, and welfare. Party members are special everywhere. This is also one of the central issues exposed by everyone. Someone said: Party members get more salary adjustments, non-Party cadres don't get adjusted even once in five or six years; Party members and non-Party members do the same work, but Party members get higher salaries; Someone said: Party members are promoted quickly, non-Party members are not. During several reorganizations, Party member section and office directors who were transferred down became deputy bureau directors, while non-Party section and office directors who were transferred down became deputy section chiefs. Ordinary cadres who were transferred down, if they were Party members, became deputy section chiefs, and if they were not Party members, they remained ordinary cadres. Someone else said: Even housing problems are different, non-Party members' housing problems, no matter how crowded or small the house is, are never resolved, while Party members' housing problems are easily solved; someone else said: The wife of a Party member requested a job transfer and was transferred in less than a week, but a member of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang has requested to resolve his wife's job problem countless times, but it has not been resolved. In fact, it is not that it cannot be resolved, mainly because he is not a communist party member. The masses believe that although these are small issues, they also reflect the factionalist sentiments of some Party leaders.

### 邮电部干部揭发党内宗派主义  非党干部有职无权　党员干部自视特殊  批评有些党员不懂技术业务，不学习，只凭老资格进行领导工作

    邮电部干部揭发党内宗派主义
    非党干部有职无权　党员干部自视特殊
    批评有些党员不懂技术业务，不学习，只凭老资格进行领导工作
    本报讯　为吸取党外意见，顺利地开展整风运动，中共邮电部党组根据中共中央统战部的指示，从上月下旬开始，采取小型座谈、个别谈心等方式，检查揭发了邮电部合作共事关系上存在的问题。在检查中，许多非党干部情绪十分高涨，有些人从他们的切身体验出发，提出：“自己还是有职有权的”，“有些地方党群关系基本上是正常的”。同时，更多的人坦率地、尖锐地批评了邮电部门党组织及某些党员的宗派主义思想作风。
    部长领导处长？
    还是处长领导部长？
    非党干部在负责岗位上不能积极、认真负责地发挥应有的作用，关键问题是有职有责而无权。有人认为：邮电部非党部长权不够的具体表现是许多部务会议流于形式，党政不分，党组代替行政的工作，有些不需要在党组会议上讨论的问题，也在党组会议上讨论。有许多可以事先让党外部长知道的事情，非党部长不知道，而党员司、局长都知道了。因此，有些部务会议，党员司、局长都没有兴趣参加，只派秘书参加。有人说：党员负责干部对朱学范部长尊重不够，有些问题，非党部长说了不算，党员处长说了算，如关于成立教育科的问题，朱部长已经批准了，但是，劳动工资处共产党员的副处长不同意，结果就没有成立；再如“三反”时，邮电部决定开除一个干部，朱部长不同意，而监察室共产党员副主任坚持要开除，结果还是开除了。究竟是谁的职权大呢？谁领导谁呢？有人说：有些问题是先经过党员副部长签字，然后再交给朱部长；有人说：有一次，朱部长在局长会议上作总结报告，是念的稿子，念完以后，又补充了他个人的意见，为什么大会总结报告没有包括他的意见呢？有人说：非党局长不敢大胆处理问题，要看党员局长的态度，党员局长点头了才敢去作。有人说：邮政总局有一位非党第一副局长批了公文，甚至已经打印了，党员第二副局长要抽回来，有些又不和他讨论，就重新审批。还有人说：党员一般干部对非党领导干部也不够尊重，认为他们不能解决问题，所以很少向他们请示报告。更多的人概括地说明了这样一个事实：党员与非党员的意见有不同时，不管谁的对，要以党员的为主，有些意见虽然是一致的，但是，说出来以后，效果却不一样。还有一位主任工程师认为：非党干部的作客思想是党员招来的，他批评党员领导干部对他的使用是“招之即来，挥之即去”。他举例说：要我随同出去开会，事先都不知道往那里去，去了干什么，也不知道。有时去了不让我们发言，这叫我们怎么树立主人翁思想呢？
    非党领导干部这种有职有责而无权的情况，已使工作受到了损失。有人举了这样的例子：杭州电信局合理化建议试制小交换机，当时长途电信总局二位非党副局长和一位非党副处长决定要把杭州的合理化建议提高、改进以后，在北京电信局试用，但是有一位党员处长不同意，并粗暴地说这是“标新立异”。后来这一位党员处长自己带了工作组出去搞了一套，回部后又花了三十多万元设置了十个交换机发到各局使用，结果有的不能用，有的即使能用，效果也不好。
  和党的政策接触是温暖的
    和党员接触是冷淡的
    有人认为：邮电部党与非党合作共事中，普遍的情况是：客客气气的关系，不是诚诚恳恳的关系，和平共处，相敬如宾，不是面对面，心对心。使许多党外人士感到：“和党的政策接触是温暖的，和党员接触是冷淡的。”有人举出这样的例子：在工作中非党员与非党员有不同意见，可以争得面红耳赤。但是，和党员研究工作时，即使有不同意见，也没有争论；党与非党干部只有工作上的关系，一走出办公室，党员与党员一道，非党员与非党员一道；非党干部与党员干部同住在一个院子里五、六年，不相往来；有些非党同志在路上碰到党员同志，拐弯就走了。为什么会形成这种状况呢？有人做了分析，他们说：非党员和党员交朋友有顾虑，他们怕说错了，提到政治上来，将来被收拾。还有人举了肃反中的例子：有一个非党同志平日爱说怪话，并没有其他问题，但在肃反中被斗争，说他说怪话就是对党不满，对党不满就是站在反革命方面，站在反革命方面，就是希望蒋介石回来，就是反革命，这样还有谁敢和党员来往呢？在谈到这个问题时，许多人还批评了有些党员“骄气十足”“盛气迫人”的思想作风，因此他们认为这也是非党干部不敢接近党员的原因。有人说：党员的脸上虽然没有写上“共产党员”的字样，但是，有的党员你一看就知道他是党员，因为他既不是处长，也不是科长，他可以随便训斥人；有人说：谁不理人了，谁就成了党员了。有一个工友盛气凌人，脾气很大，人家都说他是党员。
    另外，还有人批评了有些党员的老资格思想，他们认为这些人一不懂技术，二不懂业务，三文化不高，四不钻研，五政治学习差，将来他们只好靠历史、资格来领导。
    待遇不公，党员特殊
    在评级评薪、安排使用、生活福利等等问题上，非党员与党员不能享受同等待遇，党员处处特殊。这也是大家揭发的中心问题之一。有人说：调整工资党员调整得多，非党干部五、六年也不调整一次；党员与非党员作同样的工作，党员的工资就高些；有人说：党员提拔起来快，非党员就不然，几次整编，党员处、科长调到下面去就是副局长，而非党处、科长调下去就是副科长，一般干部调下去，是党员就当副科长，不是党员就仍然是个一般干部。还有人说：甚至住房问题也有区别，非党员的房子不管如何挤，如何小，总是不得解决，党员的房子很容易解决；再有人说：一个党员的爱人要求调动工作，不到一个星期就调来了，可是一个民革成员要求解决他爱人的工作问题，不知提过多少次意见，也不得解决。事实上，并不是不能解决，主要因为他不是共产党员。群众认为：这些虽然是小问题，但也表现了某些党的领导上的宗派主义情绪。
