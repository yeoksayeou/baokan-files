Xinhua News Agency, Manila, 20th: According to Felemon Cloma, a person in charge of a Philippine merchant ship, on the 18th, American troops have occupied at least three islands in the Nansha Islands in the South China Sea. Felemon Cloma returned on the 18th from an "inspection trip" to the Nansha Islands. He said he was surprised to find American troops stationed there.

The brother of this Philippine captain, Tomas Cloma, had, without authorization, sent a prospecting team to the Nansha Islands, which belong to China, in March 1956, named the islands "Freedomland," and demanded that they be incorporated into Philippine territory.

Xinhua News Agency, 21st: According to a report from the Kuomintang Central News Agency in Taipei, Liu Hetu, a rear admiral and military spokesperson for the Taiwan Kuomintang, admitted on the 20th that the Americans' intrusion into the Nansha Islands in the South China Sea had been agreed to in advance by the Chiang Kai-shek group.
