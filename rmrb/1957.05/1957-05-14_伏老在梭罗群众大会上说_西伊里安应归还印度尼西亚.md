Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, May 13th: Chairman Voroshilov said at a mass rally in Solo this morning: "It is only right to return West Irian to Indonesia." He added that West Irian cannot be separated from Indonesia. These words were met with enthusiastic applause and cheers from hundreds of thousands of listeners. President Sukarno stood up and shook hands with Voroshilov to express his gratitude for the support of the Soviet leader.

Voroshilov said: "The Soviet people do not want war, but hope for lasting peace." He said that there are many countries in the world, including Indonesia and the Soviet Union, that advocate the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence as the basis for handling their mutual relations. Voroshilov added that if all countries agree to these principles, peace can be maintained.

Referring to the common ground in the foreign policies of the two countries, Voroshilov pointed out that both Indonesia and the Soviet Union condemned the aggression against Egypt. He also said that the restoration of the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations cannot be delayed any longer.

President Sukarno called the mass rally held in Solo, Central Java, this morning a "friendly mass rally." Sukarno said that all ordinary people around the world want peace. He also said that those who say that the Soviet Union and China want war are lying.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, May 13th: Chairman Voroshilov, accompanied by President Sukarno, visited Solo from Yogyakarta on the afternoon of the 12th.

Voroshilov has been in good spirits. When he visited the Borobudur Pagoda near Yogyakarta yesterday morning, he refused to ride in the sedan chair prepared for him and walked up to the top of the dozens of meters high pagoda. Voroshilov praised the more than one thousand year old monument. He said that the Indonesian people were able to build such a great project so early, and now they should be able to create even greater projects related to people's lives.

Voroshilov went to Solo with President Sukarno and was warmly welcomed by the masses along the way. In Magelang, Voroshilov, according to local customs, walked barefoot into the former residence of the national hero Diponegoro. Diponegoro was the leader of the uprising against Dutch imperialism in 1825.

In Salatiga, President Sukarno and Voroshilov gave short speeches to the 20,000 people who welcomed them. Sukarno reiterated that because the Indonesian and Soviet people have common ideals, the Indonesian people love Chairman Voroshilov. He said that the vast majority of people in the world oppose imperialism and colonialism, and as long as the people are united, they can defeat them.

Voroshilov expressed his gratitude to the masses who warmly welcomed him. He said that he agreed with what President Sukarno said. As long as the people are united, they will certainly be able to change the world, achieve a happy future for mankind, and eliminate the evil of war.

    伏老在梭罗群众大会上说
    西伊里安应归还印度尼西亚
    据新华社雅加达13日电　伏罗希洛夫主席今天上午在梭罗群众大会上说：“把西伊里安交还给印度尼西亚是理所应当的”。他又说，西伊里安是不能从印度尼西亚分割开的。这些话引起了数十万听众热烈的鼓掌欢呼。苏加诺总统站起来同伏罗希洛夫握手，表示感谢这位苏联领导人的支持。
    伏罗希洛夫说：“苏联人民不要战争，而希望持久和平。”他说，世界上有许多国家，包括印度尼西亚和苏联在内，是赞成以和平共处五项原则作为处理它们相互关系的基础的。伏罗希洛夫又说，如果所有国家都同意这些原则的话，和平是可能保持的。
    伏罗希洛夫在谈到两国外交政策的共同点时指出，印度尼西亚和苏联都谴责了对埃及的侵略。他又说，恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利这件事不能再拖延了。
    苏加诺总统把今天上午在中爪哇梭罗举行的群众大会称为“友好群众大会”。苏加诺说，全世界所有的普通老百姓都要和平。他又说，那些说苏联和中国要战争的人们是在撒谎。
    据新华社雅加达13日电　伏罗希洛夫主席在苏加诺总统陪同下，12日下午从日惹到梭罗访问。
    伏老精神一直很健旺，昨天上午他参观日惹附近的“婆罗浮屠”佛塔的时候，拒绝乘坐给他准备的肩轿，健步走上几十公尺高的佛塔顶层。伏老对这个一千多年的古迹赞不绝口。他说，这么早印度尼西亚人民就能够建造这样伟大的工程，现在应当能够创造更大的、同人民生活有关的工程。
    伏老同苏加诺总统一道到梭罗去，在路上受到了群众的热烈欢迎。在马吉冷，伏老按照当地习俗，赤脚走进民族英雄迪波内果罗的故居参观。迪波内果罗是1825年反对荷兰帝国主义起义的领导者。
    在沙拉笛加，苏加诺总统和伏老向欢迎他们的两万人民发表了简短演说。苏加诺再次指出，因为印度尼西亚和苏联两国人民有着共同的理想，所以印度尼西亚人民热爱伏罗希洛夫主席。他说，世界上绝大多数人民都反对帝国主义和殖民主义，只要人民团结一致就能够打败它们。
    伏老向热烈欢迎他的群众表示感谢。他说，他同意苏加诺总统所说的话。只要人民团结一致，就一定能够改变世界，达到人类幸福的将来和消灭罪恶的战争。
