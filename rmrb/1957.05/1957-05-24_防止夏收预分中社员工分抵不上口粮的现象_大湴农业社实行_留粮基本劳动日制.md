    To Prevent the Phenomenon of Commune Members' Work Points Not Covering Their Grain Rations in the Summer Harvest Pre-Distribution
    Da Bian Agricultural Cooperative Implements a "Basic Grain-Securing Workday System"
    (Our News) According to a Guangxi Daily report: The Da Bian Agricultural Cooperative in Cenxi County, Guangxi, in order to prevent the phenomenon of commune members' work points not being enough to cover their entitled grain rations during the summer harvest pre-distribution, has implemented a "Basic Grain-Securing Workday System" since early February.
    Last year, 63% of the cooperative members' households had work points that were insufficient to cover their entitled grain rations, and they needed to be given some money by the cooperative to get enough grain. One of the main reasons for this phenomenon was the cadres' lack of experience in running the cooperative, and their failure to pay attention to balancing work attendance early on, which resulted in some commune members not working enough and not earning enough grain. This year, the cooperative management committee has learned from this lesson and adopted the "Basic Grain-Securing Workday System." The method is: based on the cooperative's agricultural and sideline production plan for this year, calculate the value of each workday in the first half of the year, and at the same time, according to the current grain retention standard, calculate the amount of grain that each person should receive in the summer harvest pre-distribution this year, and calculate the number of workdays each person must work by the time of the summer harvest pre-distribution in order to obtain this grain. Based on this, the cooperative systematically schedules work for the members, so that under the premise of obeying the cooperative's production plan and labor plan, they first complete the "Basic Grain-Securing Workday" that they should complete.
    After the implementation of the "Basic Grain-Securing Workday System," the production enthusiasm of the commune members has been improved.

    防止夏收预分中社员工分抵不上口粮的现象
    大湴农业社实行“留粮基本劳动日制”
    本报讯　据广西日报报道：广西岑溪县大湴农业社，为了防止在夏收预分时发生社员的工分抵不上应得口粮的现象，从2月上旬以来实行了“留粮基本劳动日制”。
    这个社在去年有63％的社员户工分抵不上应得的口粮，需要补一些钱给社才能分足口粮。产生这种现象的主要原因之一，是干部缺乏办社经验，没有及早注意平衡出工，致使一部分社员出工太少而换不回口粮。今年，社管委会接受了这一教训，采取了“留粮基本劳动日制”的办法。作法是：根据社里今年的农业和副业生产计划，算出上半年的每个劳动日值，同时按照现在的留粮标准算出今年夏收预分每人应得的口粮数，算出获得这些口粮每人到夏收预分为止必须出工的劳动日数。根据这些，社里有计划地给社员排工，使他们在服从社的生产计划和劳动规划的前提下，首先完成他们应该完成的“留粮基本劳动日”。
    实行“留粮基本劳动日制”以后，社员们的生产积极性提高了。
