What Contradictions Exist in the Peking Opera World?
This Newspaper and the Ministry of Culture Invited Some Peking Opera Actors to a Symposium Yesterday
Ye Sheng-lan and Others Exposed the Serious Sectarianism of the China Peking Opera Theater

This Newspaper reports: What contradictions currently exist in the Peking Opera world? What serious consequences have bureaucratism, sectarianism, and dogmatism caused in the Peking Opera world? At a symposium jointly convened yesterday afternoon by this newspaper and the Ministry of Culture, some Peking Opera actors made revelations.

Mei Lanfang, the Director, Has the Title but No Power

Ye Sheng-lan, Ye Sheng-zhang, and Du Jin-fang exposed the bureaucratism and sectarianism of the China Peking Opera Theater at the symposium.

Ye Sheng-lan said: Mr. Mei Lanfang is the director, and the whole world knows this. However, he has the title but no power. I feel that Mr. Mei has not received the respect he deserves and has not been able to display his true abilities. To give a small example, Mr. Mei opposed turning Liu Lihua in “San Cha Kou” into a “pretty boy,” but it was changed anyway.

Ye Sheng-lan said: The theater's Art Committee is practically non-existent. The Art Committee has not discussed artistic issues. As far as I remember, only three meetings have been held since the theater was established. I am a member of the Art Committee and am very willing to express my opinions and views, but I have no opportunity. After the old rules and regulations were criticized, Comrade Ma Shao-bo said at an Art Committee meeting that in the past many operas were not performed, and you heads of troupes are also responsible. Why didn't you propose good operas? The implication was that we should make self-criticisms.

Ye Sheng-lan also spoke about his own troubles as a "troupe leader": he has the title, the responsibility, but no power, and he is responsible for self-criticisms. The troupe leader should be informed of artistic issues, but the leading artistic cadres of the theater do not communicate with us. For example, regarding the issue of scenery, there is debate about whether to use three-dimensional or impressionistic scenery. The scenery of Hua Mulan's home in the first scene of "Mulan Joins the Army" looks like the Grand View Garden, and the loom is too big and too realistic. According to the traditional Peking Opera performance method, Mulan uses simple props to weave, facing the front of the stage; now a large "realistic" loom is used, and Mulan faces the upper stage, singing while turning sideways to make expressions to the audience. This creates difficulties for the actors. I raised my opinions at the meeting. As a result, I received an "urgent" document from Jiang Li of the art design team, which placed many labels on me and questioned me, saying: The performance of this opera has already been summarized and praised, why do you disagree?

Outside, the Repertoire is Greatly Opened Up
But Things are Desolate in the Peking Opera Theater

Ye Sheng-zhang said: Since the opening up of the repertoire, things outside are booming, but what about us? There are many old rules and regulations. We have dug for new material, but very little. Because some cadres say that the Peking Opera Theater is a national theater and must be cautious. Therefore, operas like "Si Lang Visits His Mother" and "Huang Tianba" are imprisoned in the Peking Opera Theater. He once raised different opinions regarding the handling of "San Cha Kou" and wrote an article, but there was no response within the theater. He said: "Is it about co-existence of the old and the new, or what? I don't know." Du Jin-fang advocated that during the rectification campaign, the leadership should dispel the artists' concerns and encourage everyone to explore traditional repertoire, but now everyone is still a bit reserved.

Hand Over Artistic Creation to the Artists

Ye Sheng-lan said: The China Peking Opera Theater's leadership uses administrative orders to replace artistic leadership, which has caused great losses to the Peking Opera cause. The negative consequences are reflected in: opera reform does not rely on veteran artists, operas are crudely changed, and the repertoire is impoverished.

Ye Sheng-lan said that in artistic creation, the naturalistic style is becoming more and more serious. Before the repertoire meeting, so-called "realism" was required. If you drink tea, you must have real tea; if you fight, you must really fight. Many beautiful artistic images and scenes in "Yan Yang Lou" were cancelled because the leading artistic cadres misunderstood. Forcibly applying Stanislavski's method, even for a simple question like "Where do you come from?" one has to wait a long time for an answer. (Ye Sheng-lan made a young male character's expression of contemplating a problem and then recited:) "Just came back from a meeting at the People's Daily!" This is called reciting "subtext." The music has also been changed to the point where people don't understand it. The tune of "Xiao Fang Niu" was originally so beautiful, but it has been changed to sound like "Liu Hai Chopping Firewood." Some dances have been changed to resemble ballet. He advocated that artistic creation should be delegated to the artists.

Large Organization, Actors Wasting Time

Ye Sheng-lan said: Even if there is a repertoire, there is no one to perform it. Because the organization is large and inefficient! The three troupes have a total of 452 people. There are 178 actors, and many are wasting time. There are a lot of painted-face roles, and if East China wants them, they are not given. There is no interaction between the troupes. I once said that it is like a game of chess that has reached a stalemate. It looks lively, but no piece can move. It would be great if Yuan Shihai and Du Jin-fang could co-star in "Farewell My Concubine," but it's impossible because they are not in the same troupe. I used to often sing "Heroes' Gathering," but I can't sing it anymore. Our troupe has Lu Su, but no Kong Ming. Sometimes, it is difficult to borrow a huqin from another troupe. Folk professional troupes are merging, but we are dividing. I really don't understand why. If the three troupes were merged into two, everyone could learn from each other's strengths, and the male, female, painted-face, and clown roles could be well-matched, and there would also be more appeal. Without changing the organization, more and better traditional repertoires cannot be developed! Ye Sheng-zhang also said: We have a few too many people in the Peking Opera Theater: many actors, but also few. What does this mean? It means that there are few actors who "eat grass" and many who "take a stroll." He believes that the current situation of actors wasting time should be resolved uniformly by the Ministry of Culture.

Why Do Actors Also Have to Sit in the Office for Eight Hours?

Ye Sheng-lan, Ye Sheng-zhang, and Du Jin-fang raised objections to the theater implementing an eight-hour work system like other government agencies. They asked: Is this in line with the laws of artistic leadership? Every actor, regardless of whether they have a play to rehearse or not, has to be there every day, just chatting all day. With so many people and so much to do, it is impossible to have independent thought for artistic creation. Ye Sheng-lan said: Young actors like to go to work in the morning, but we who are around forty years old can't get up. In the past, we used to perform for forty days straight, and Mr. Ma Lianliang is still in good spirits even after performing for a month or so, but the health of the actors in our theater is not very good, and there are many sick people. We should consider whether this is related to the eight-hour work system. (Du Jin-fang interjected: "I am the most disobedient. In previous years, when I was learning from Mr. Wang Yaoqing, I often couldn't get to work on time because I wanted to learn opera. Before Mr. Wang passed away, I even rushed to copy three operas." Xia Yan said: "You copied the right ones!" Liu Zhiming said: "I thought this problem had been resolved in 1953, how come it's still an eight-hour work system now!")

The Disparity in Treatment Between State-Owned and Private Theaters is Huge
We Hope That the Cultural Departments Will Coordinate and Take Everything into Account

The symposium also discussed the contradictions between private professional troupes and state-owned troupes. Xi Xiaobo and Wu Suqiu both believe that many actors in private professional troupes cannot work with peace of mind and always envy state-owned troupes. Because the staff of state-owned troupes have fixed incomes, fixed locations to rehearse, study, and research their work; good theaters and good costumes to perform in; and the programs they perform are rehearsed for a long time and with the help of experts, which guarantees quality. What about private professional troupes? None of these conditions exist. However, the audience spends money to buy tickets and always hopes to see good operas. They won't forgive us just because we are not state-owned and have poor economic conditions. Because there is no fixed location, political, cultural, and professional studies cannot be carried out in private professional troupes. In particular, labor insurance is a very important and urgent problem to be solved. Xi Xiaobo said: "Among the private professional troupes in Beijing, our Fourth Troupe is still in a relatively good situation; when an actor is sick, they only receive a maximum of one yuan a day for care. Please think about it, when a person is sick, they have to see a doctor and take medicine, and their parents, wife, and children still have to eat, how can they survive? But the actors in state-owned troupes still receive their salaries when they are sick, and the government pays for their medical expenses. We are all actors, why is our treatment so different?" He believes that there are a total of forty or so private professional troupes in Beijing, including Peking Opera, Ping Opera, and Quyi, and some of them are in a much worse situation than they are. One troupe has dozens of people, plus their families, which is more than a hundred people. The government cannot ignore this problem. Liang Yiming also hopes that the cultural authorities can make unified arrangements and take everything into account regarding the problems of insufficient manpower and low quality in private professional troupes.

Peking Opera Actors Have No Successors, Hard Work and Traditional Practices Are Interrupted

When talking about training new actors, the actors all expressed concern about the lack of successors and spoke with regret about how many young actors and students today do not respect veteran artists and teachers, and are not self-respecting. Xu Lan-yuan and An Shu-yuan both believe that in the past, teachers were extremely strict with their students. As the saying goes, "Spare the rod, spoil the child." Now, every actor who is even slightly famous has grown up being beaten. Beating is of course not good, but being strict is good. Students all know how to study hard and practice diligently, and they are all grateful to their teachers after they grow up. Now, beating is no longer allowed, and students are not very obedient, and they are not willing to study hard and practice diligently. Sun Sheng-wen said: Some young actors don't think much of their teachers and call themselves disciples of the Mei School, the Ma School, or the Tan School, etc., but they learn to be neither fish nor fowl. It is okay to want to learn a certain school's operas, but you can't simply imitate the superficial aspects. You must lay a good foundation yourself and then use your heart to understand. But they never appreciate the teachers' painstaking efforts to pass on their entire art. They are also unwilling to play supporting roles during performances. In fact, a good supporting role is more important than a secondary leading role. Lei Xi-fu said sadly and passionately: "Now, teachers have to teach students with a smile on their faces. Sometimes, I even want to go to the parents to cry and ask for help. We people in our sixties have never experienced this before!" Because students do not respect their teachers, some teachers no longer teach seriously. Some young actors and students are half-baked and only grasp the Stanislavski system, thinking that the old artists' stuff "can be put in the Palace Museum."

Everyone hopes to cultivate some outstanding actors as soon as possible, but the growth of actors takes time. It is rare for students to be good roles immediately after graduation. Generally, they have to go through long-term stage practice. Now, young actors, especially students of opera schools, have very few opportunities to perform. There is also a slogan among students of "no outstanding individuals allowed." If you perform a few scenes, I have to perform a few scenes too. If someone performs a few more scenes, everyone glares at them, making everyone who performs feel insecure. Ye Sheng-lan put forward a good suggestion: In the past, students in opera schools performed during the day because theaters were usually empty during the day and easy to rent. This method can also be used now, so that students can gain more stage experience during their school years, and performing during the day will not interfere with their classes the next day.

Du Jin-fang also specifically talked about how young actresses' marriages can affect their stage careers. Actors need to be slender, but once they get married and have children, they become fatter and less agile on stage. She believes that it is good to promote late marriage and contraception now, which is especially suitable for actresses. She feels that actresses should marry late or even not marry, and devote their whole bodies and minds to art, but this can only be done by artists who love art more than their own lives.

Tian Han, Chairman of the Chinese Dramatists Association, also emphasized at the meeting that actors should love art. He said: "People with artistic conscience have to pay the price and make many personal sacrifices for art. But now, young people lack this kind of love."

Little Practice, Many Subjects
Dogmatism Affects Opera Teaching

Zhao Tong-shan (Fu Rong-cao) exposed the dogmatism within the China Opera School. He said: Four walls, big, small, high, and short, hindered the development of teaching work. In the past, Peking Opera actors always performed frequently and met with the audience frequently. This not only made the audience familiar with the actors, but also increased the actors' stage experience. The China Opera School, however, emphasized everything for teaching and limited the students' performance activities. He believes that if a student learns an opera well but does not perform it for a long time and has no opportunity to practice, it will not be consolidated.

The course arrangement of the China Opera School is also often disconnected. For example, the Peking Opera Department has its own head and students, and the Music Department also has its own head and students; but each learns their own thing and does not interfere with each other. When it comes to performing, when the people in the Music Department play the gongs and drums for the actors in the Peking Opera Department, the two sides do not match up.

Ye Sheng-zhang also believes that the school's courses are too numerous, and some courses that are not closely related to opera, such as algebra, can be reduced, because too many of these courses will reduce the number of professional courses. He said: "My child has been attending opera school for four or five years, and recently I tried his legs and found that he is still not very good."

Ye Sheng-zhang also advocates that students should have more opportunities to perform. He said that now some students are looking for teachers everywhere to learn opera, but although they learn a lot, they quickly forget it. "A thousand studies are not as good as one practice." It is not enough to just learn without performing.

Encouraged by the "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" Policy
Xiao Cui-hua is About to Return to the Stage

Yu Lian-quan (Xiao Cui-hua) did not attend the symposium due to illness. His son, Yu Shi-wen, relayed his opinions. Xiao Cui-hua is a flower actress. In the past few years, when old rules and regulations were popular, his operas became fewer and fewer. He has been away from the stage for five years. Recently, encouraged by the Party's thought of "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend," he yearns to return to the stage and perform for the audience. He will soon perform an opera that was banned in the past, "Ma Si-yuan."

### 京剧界有些什么矛盾？  本报和文化部昨天邀请一些京剧演员座谈  叶盛兰等揭发中国京剧院宗派主义严重

    京剧界有些什么矛盾？
    本报和文化部昨天邀请一些京剧演员座谈
    叶盛兰等揭发中国京剧院宗派主义严重
    本报讯　京剧界现在有些什么矛盾？官僚主义、宗派主义、教条主义在京剧界造成了哪些严重恶果？在本报和文化部昨天下午共同邀集的座谈会上，一部分京剧演员作了揭发。
    梅兰芳院长有职无权
    叶盛兰、叶盛章和杜近芳在座谈会上揭发了中国京剧院的官僚主义和宗派主义。
    叶盛兰说：梅兰芳先生是院长，全世界都知道这件事。可是他有职无权。我觉得梅先生没有得到应有的尊重，没有拿出真正的本领来。举个小例子，“三岔口”的刘利华，梅先生反对改成小白脸，结果还是照样改。
    叶盛兰说：院的艺委会等于虚设。艺委会上没有研究过艺术问题。就我所记得的，建院以来，只开过三次会。我是艺委会的成员，很愿意把自己的见解、看法谈出来，但是没有机会。清规戒律受到批判以后，马少波同志在一次艺委会上，说过去很多戏不唱，你们做团长的也有责任，你们有好戏为什么不提呢？意思是要我们检讨。
    叶盛兰也谈了他自己作为一个“团长”的苦恼：有职、有责，就是没权，检讨倒有份。艺术上的问题应该让团长来知道，可是，院的领导艺术的负责同志，不跟我们通气。比如关于布景问题，到底用立体，还是用写意的，有争论。“木兰从军”的第一场戏，花木兰家里的布景像是大观园，织布机太大，太真实。按京剧传统表演方法，木兰织布用简单的道具，脸冲前台；现在是用了一个很大的“真实的”织布机，木兰脸朝上场面，一面唱，一面还要侧过身子向观众作表情。演员有困难。开会研究的时候，我提出了意见。结果收到了美术组长江里同志的一份“急件”，扣了好多帽子，还责问说：这个戏演出处已有总结，给予表扬，你为什么不同意？
    外面剧目大开放
    京剧院里冷清清
    叶盛章说：从剧目开放以来，外面搞得轰轰烈烈，我们呢？清规戒律很多。挖也挖了，但很少。因为有的干部说京剧院是国家剧院，要慎重。所以“四郎探母”、“黄天霸”这些戏在京剧院就坐监狱了。他曾经对于“三岔口”的处理提出不同的意见，写了文章，但院内没有反应；他说：“到底是新旧并存，还是怎么样呢？我不知道。”杜近芳主张在整风期间，领导上要解除艺人的顾虑，让大家多多发掘传统剧目，现在大家还有点保留。
    把艺术创作交给艺人
    叶盛兰说：中国京剧院领导上用行政命令代替艺术领导，使得京剧事业造成了很大的损失。它的恶果表现在：戏曲改革不依靠老艺人，粗暴的改戏，剧目贫乏。
    叶盛兰说在艺术创造上，自然主义作风愈来愈严重。剧目会议以前，要求所谓“真实感”，喝茶，得有真茶；打，得真打。“艳阳楼”被取消了好多好看的艺术形象和画面，是领导艺术的干部领会错了的缘故。硬搬斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基，一句很简单的问话：“你从那里来？”也要等半天回答，（叶盛兰作了一个小生思考问题的眼神，又念道：）“刚从人民日报开会回来！”这叫念“潜台词”。音乐也改得令人不懂了。“小放牛”的调儿原来多好听，改得像“刘海砍樵”。有些舞蹈改得像芭蕾舞。他主张，把艺术创作的事儿，下放给艺人。
    机构庞大，演员窝工
    叶盛兰说：有了剧目，也无人演。因为机构庞大，机构不灵！三个团，共有四百五十二人。演员一百七十八人，窝工的很多。花脸一大堆，华东要，不给。团与团之间却不相往来，我曾说过，好像一盘下成僵局的棋，看了挺热闹，车马炮将士相一个子儿也不能动。“霸王别姬”让袁世海、杜近芳合演多好，不行，不在一个团；我从前常唱的 “群英会”也不能唱了，我们团里有鲁肃，没有孔明。有时候，这个团向那个团借把胡琴都困难。民间职业剧团在合，我们却在分，我真不明白这是为什么。如果三个团拼成二个团，大家可以取长补短，生旦净丑可以调配得齐全，也可以有号召力。不改变机构，更多更好的传统剧目是挖不出来的！叶盛章也说：我们京剧院的人有点多：演员多，但也少，这是什么意思呢？就是吃草的演员少，溜弯的多。他认为这种演员窝工的现状，应由文化部来统一解决。
    演员为什么也要坐
    八小时的办公室？
    叶盛兰、叶盛章和杜近芳对剧院同其他机关一样地实行八小时上班制提出意见。他们问：这是否合乎领导艺术的规律？每个演员，不管有戏排还是没有戏，每天都要顶在那里，没事就聊大天。人杂事繁，根本不可能为艺术创造进行独立思考。叶盛兰说：青年演员爱早晨上班，我们这些四十左右的人就起不来。从前，我们一唱四十天，马连良先生现在连唱个把月精神也很好，可是我们院里演员健康情况很不好，病号很多，应当考虑一下是不是同这种八小时的上班制有关。（杜近芳插言说：“我是最不听话的。前些年，我向王瑶卿先生学习时，老不能按时上班，想去学戏。在王先生临终前，我还赶去抄了三出戏。”夏衍说：“你抄对了！”刘芝明说：“我以为这个问题在1953年已经解决了，怎么到现在还是八小时上班制！”）
    国营民营之间待遇悬殊
    希望文化部门统筹兼顾
    座谈会上也谈到了民间职业剧团和国营剧团之间的矛盾。奚啸伯和吴素秋都认为：民间职业剧团有很多演员不能够安心工作，心里总是羡慕国营剧团。因为国营剧团的工作人员有固定的收入，有固定的团址排戏、学习、研究业务；有好剧院、好戏箱演戏；演出的节目又是经过较长时间的排练和专家的帮助，能够保证质量。民间职业剧团呢？这些条件都没有。可是观众花钱买票，总希望看好戏，他不会因为我们不是国营，经济条件差就原谅我们。因为没有固定的团址，民间职业剧团的政治、文化、业务学习都无法进行。特别是劳动保险，这是一个非常重要、急待解决的问题。奚啸伯说：“在北京市的民间职业剧团中，我们四团还是情况比较好的；一个演员病了，每天顶多才拿到一元的照顾费。请大家想想，一个人生了病要看病吃药，家里的父母妻子儿女照样要吃饭，怎么过下去呢？而国营剧团的演员生病照样拿薪，上医院公家出钱，我们同样是演员，为什么我们的待遇这样不同？”他认为北京市京剧、评剧、曲艺等一共四十几个民间职业剧团，有的比他们的情况还要坏得多。一个团几十个人，加上家属就是百多人，这个问题政府不能不管。梁益鸣也希望文化主管部门对于民间职业剧团人力不足、质量不高的问题，能够统一安排、统筹兼顾。
    京剧演员后继无人勤学苦练传统中断
    谈到培养新演员的时候，演员们都担忧后继乏人，以痛惜的口吻谈到现在许多青年演员、学生不太尊重老艺人、老师，而又不太自爱。徐兰沅和安舒元都认为：从前老师傅教学生极严厉，所谓不打不成材，现在稍有名气的演员哪一个不是挨打才成长的。打当然不好，但严格是好的，学生都知道勤学苦练，成长后没有不感激师傅的。现在不兴打了，学生也不大听话了，不肯勤学苦练了。孙盛文说：有些青年演员眼里不大瞧得起师傅，各以梅派、马派、谭派等自居，学得三不像。愿学哪派戏是可以的，但不能单纯模仿学皮相，必须自己下苦功夫打好基础，然后用心体会才行。但他们总不体会老师们一片苦心地要把混身艺术传授下来。演出时又不大愿意演配角，其实好配角比次主角还重要。雷喜福沉痛而激昂地说：“现在做老师要满脸陪笑地去教学生，有时恨不得到家长那里去哭一场，请求帮助，这，我们六十多岁的人了，从前没经历过！”由于学生不尊重老师，有的老师也就不再认真地去教了。有些青年演员、学生一知半解，只抓住斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基体系，认为老艺人的玩意“可以放到故宫博物院去了”。
    大家都希望赶快培养出一些优秀的演员来，但演员的成长是有过程的，学生一毕业出来就是好角色的情形是个别的，一般总要经过长期的舞台锻炼才行。现在青年演员特别是戏曲学校学生演戏的机会很少。学生之间还有“不准拔尖”的口号，你演几场我也要演几场，有人多演了几场，大家都瞪眼珠，使演者人人自危。叶盛兰提出了一个很好的建议：从前科班学生都在白天演出，因为戏场子白天大都有空容易租到。现在也可采用此法，使学生在学校时期就能多得些舞台实践经验，而且白天演出，也不妨害他们次日上课。
    杜近芳还特别谈到青年女演员的结婚会影响舞台生涯。演员的身材要求苗条些，一结婚生了孩子，身材粗了，上得台去也就不灵活了。她认为现在提倡晚婚和节育很好，特别适合于女演员。她觉得女演员最好晚结婚甚至不结婚，把全身心投进艺术里去，但这要热爱艺术超过热爱生命的艺人才能办到。
    中国戏剧家协会主席田汉在会上也强调了演员应该热爱艺术。他说：“有艺术良心的人，为了艺术，就得付出代价，作很多个人的牺牲。可是现在青年人都很缺乏这种热爱。”
    实践少　课目多
    教条主义影响戏曲教学
    赵桐珊（芙蓉草）揭发了中国戏曲学校内部的教条主义。他说：大、小、高、矮四堵墙，阻碍了教学工作的开展。过去京剧演员总是经常演出，经常和观众见面的。这样不但使观众熟悉了演员，演员也增加了舞台经验。中国戏曲学校却强调一切为了教学，限制了学员的演出活动。他认为，一个学生如果学好了一出戏，长久不演，没有实践的机会，就不会得到巩固。
    中国戏曲学校的课目的配合也常常脱节。譬如京剧科有自己的科长和学生，音乐科也有自己的科长和学生；但是各学各的，互不相干。等到演出的时候，音乐科的人为京剧科的演员打锣鼓时，两边配不拢来。
    叶盛章也认为学校的课目太繁多了，有些和戏曲不太接近的课程如代数等可以减去一些，因为这些课目太多，就会使业务课减少。他说：“我的孩子上戏曲学校上了四、五年，最近我试试他的腿，发觉他还很不行。”
    叶盛章也主张学生应该有更多的演出的机会。他说，现在有些学生四处找老师学戏，可是学得虽多很快也就忘了。“千学不如一练”，光学不演还是不行的。
    在“鸣”“放”方针鼓舞下
    筱翠花即将重登舞台
    于连泉（筱翠花）因病没有出席座谈会。他的儿子于世文转述了他的意见。筱翠花是花旦，前几年，清规戒律风行一时，他的戏愈来愈少。他离开舞台生活已有五年。最近受了党的“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的思想的鼓舞，渴望能重新登台献艺，同观众见面。日内他将要演出一部从前遭禁的戏“马思远”。
