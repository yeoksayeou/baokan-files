Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 14th: Vientiane dispatch: Prince Souphanouvong, leader of the Lao Fighting Units, told Agence France-Presse reporters on the 13th that American interference is an obstacle to the reunification of Laos.

Souphanouvong believes that if the agreements already signed in past negotiations can be implemented, then the difficulties arising in the negotiations can be overcome more easily. The implementation of the agreements will guarantee and prove that we can solve the problems regardless of American interference.

Souphanouvong already accompanied Vice-King Phetsarath by plane to Sam Neua on the 13th, to visit the assembly areas of the Lao Fighting Units.

Before his departure, Souphanouvong told Agence France-Presse reporters that neutrality in foreign affairs and the rights and freedoms of democracy internally are two fundamental principles of cooperation between the two sides. He said, "On this point, the Royal Government agrees with our views. But between these principles and the implementation of these principles, there is an obstacle, and that is American interference." Souphanouvong said that the United States often uses financial aid as a means to force the Royal Government to conform to American policies.

Souphanouvong pointed out that the Lao Fighting Units have not proposed that the Royal Government accept Chinese economic aid as a prerequisite for cooperation. He said, "We believe that aid from a non-Western country would be a guarantee of neutrality and independence for the Kingdom, because such aid could free us from the shackles of the United States." He added that Laos has no reason not to maintain friendly relations with China, just as it does with all of Laos's neighbors.

    苏发努冯陪同副国王往桑怒访问
    斥责美国阻挠老挝重新统一
    据新华社河内14日电　万象消息：寮国战斗部队领袖苏发努冯亲王13日对法新社记者说，美国的干涉是老挝重新统一的一个障碍。
    苏发努冯认为，如果过去在谈判中已经签订的协定能够开始实行，那么谈判中产生的困难就可以比较容易克服。协定的执行将保证和证明我们能够不顾美国干涉解决问题。
    苏发努冯已经在13日陪同副国王佩差拉乘飞机前往桑怒，访问寮国战斗部队集结区。
    苏发努冯动身前对法新社记者说，对外方面的中立和内部方面的民主的权利和自由，是双方合作的两个根本原则。他说，在这一点上，王国政府同我们的意见是一致的。但是在这些原则和这些原则的执行之间存在着一个障碍，那就是美国的干涉。苏发努冯说，美国经常用财政援助作为手段来迫使王国政府附和美国政策。
    苏发努冯指出，寮国战斗部队并没有提出过要王国政府接受中国经济援助作为合作的先决条件。他说：“我们认为一个非西方国家的援助对王国来说将是中立和独立的保证，因为这种援助可以使我们摆脱美国的束缚。”他又说，老挝没有任何理由不同中国保持像对老挝所有的邻国一样的友好关系。
