    Only Recognize Official Documents, Not People
    Shen Tongheng
    The counter-revolutionary element Li Wanming, consistently engaged in deception, smoothly infiltrated many organizations, and was finally exposed and the case solved. Zhang Shunyou, a Shanxi farmer who was wrongly accused, endured hardship and tirelessly visited many organizations, and finally clarified the truth and his "reversal" was achieved. These two events illustrate the same truth: any false appearance will eventually be revealed, and the truth will come to light.
    However, the fact that Li Wanming infiltrated many organizations before being exposed, and that Zhang Shunyou visited many organizations before achieving redress, also raises another issue that deserves our vigilance: today, our "Kuang Zhongs" are still too few, while characters like the excessively rigid seem to be quite numerous.
    The old society's bureaucratic malpractice of "officials protecting officials" will not exist openly today. However, being averse to mass opinions, being too lazy to investigate facts, and placing blind faith in official documents have always been considered by bureaucrats as a convenient and time-saving working method, and they seem reluctant to change it for the time being.
    The Li Wanming incident and the Zhang Shunyou incident are long past. The sensational Kun Opera "Fifteen Strings of Cash" has also gradually faded from the audience's memory. I wonder what the bureaucrats' working methods are like these days? I am deeply concerned! (Attached picture)
    -- Don't bother, our cadres have complete files, isn't the situation already perfectly clear!
    In the May 19th column, the article "Different Standpoints" omitted the original attached cartoon during layout and mistakenly included the illustration of another short article, "Everyone Has Their Own Preferences," and omitted the original title and description of the picture (the original title was "Little Wang's and Old Wang's Melons," they each thought that only their own melon "is truly a melon"). We hereby correct this. – Editor

    只认公文不认人
    沈同衡
    反革命分子李万铭，一贯撞骗，顺利地混过了许多机关，而终于被揭发，破了案。受冤枉的山西农民张顺有，历尽艰辛，不屈地走访了许多机关，而终于弄清是非，“平”了“反”。这两件事说明了同一个道理：任何假象，最后总归要水落石出，而真相大白。
    然而，李万铭混过了许多机关才被破案，张顺有走访了许多机关才得平反，这里也还有另一个问题值得我们警惕，就是：今天我们的况钟毕竟仍嫌太少，而过于执那样的人物倒似乎还相当多。
    “官官相护”这种旧社会的衙门恶习，今天是不会公开存在的了，不过，厌烦群众意见，懒得调查事实，和偏信公文材料，却一直是官僚主义者们奉为简便省事的一种工作方法，而且一时好像还舍不得改掉。
    李万铭事件、张顺有事件，都早已过去。哄动一时的昆剧“十五贯”，也已渐渐在观众的印象中淡去。不知官僚主义者的工作方法，近况如何？至以为念！（附图片）
    ——甭麻烦啦，咱们干部材料齐全，情况不早都一清二楚了吗！
    5月19日本栏“立场不同”一文，编排时遗漏了原附的漫画，而误将另一短文“各有所好”的插画排入，并遗漏了该画的原题和说明（原题是“小王和老王的瓜”，他们各自以为只有自己的瓜“才真正是个瓜”）。特此补正。　　　——编者
