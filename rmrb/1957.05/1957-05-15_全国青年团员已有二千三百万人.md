Xinhua News Agency report:

    On the eve of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League's renaming as the Chinese Communist Youth League, its membership has grown from 190,000 in early 1949 to the current 23 million, accounting for 19.17% of the total youth population nationwide. The 920,000 Youth League branches across the country have become a powerful assistant to the Party in various tasks.
    Currently, there are 2.28 million Youth League members on the industrial front, 13.67 million on the agricultural front, 680,000 in commerce, 3.6 million in culture and education, 970,000 in state organs and people's organizations, and 1.8 million in the military and other fields. On various fronts, they are generally able to closely unite the youth masses and actively participate in various construction endeavors.
    The Youth League organization has developed rapidly along with various social reforms and socialist transformation movements. Young people have been greatly tempered and raised their awareness in these movements. When the First National Congress of the Youth League was convened in 1949, there were only 190,000 League members nationwide. After various democratic revolution movements such as the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and land reform, the number of people joining the Youth League greatly increased. By the time of the Second National Congress of the Youth League in 1953, the number of League members had increased to 9.9 million. Since the nationwide socialist transformation entered a high tide in 1955, the Youth League organization has continued to grow, and the number of League members nationwide has now increased by 13.1 million compared to 1953.
    The Youth League's grassroots organizations are distributed throughout the country. In 1953, there were only 380,000 grassroots Youth League organizations nationwide, and now the number has increased by nearly one and a half times. In 1953, about 10% of the counties nationwide had not yet established Youth League leadership organizations at the county level, and about 30% of the townships and villages in rural areas had not yet established League branches. Currently, all counties across the country have League leading organs, and League branches have been generally established in the vast rural villages and agricultural production cooperatives. More than 35,000 Youth League branches have also been established in commerce, handicrafts and other enterprises.
    Currently, 600,000 young people from minority nationalities have joined the Youth League organization, distributed among 45 minority nationalities. In 1953, Youth League organizations were established only in individual areas that had undergone democratic reforms in border and minority nationality areas. Now, League organizations have been established in the vast majority of minority nationality areas. The number of League members in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has increased more than six times compared to 1953. After Tibet began building the League among Tibetan youth on May 4, 1956, there are now 2,761 League members throughout Tibet. In 1955, the border areas of Yunnan Province developed 4,480 minority nationality League members and established 277 new League branches. In the autonomous prefectures and pastoral areas of Wu Zhong Hui, Gannan Tibetan, and Guyuan Hui in Gansu Province, the number of minority nationality League members has grown to account for more than 10% of the total number of young people.
    After undergoing various revolutionary struggles, a large number of young women actively participated in the Youth League organization. Currently, there are 6.6 million female League members nationwide, more than double the number in 1953.
    In recent years, Youth League organizations in various localities have paid close attention to carrying out communist ideological education among the vast number of League members, raising their ideological awareness. Since the founding of the League in 1949, a large number of outstanding League members have joined the Communist Party of China. By the end of 1956, 2.8 million Youth League members nationwide had joined the Party.

    全国青年团员已有二千三百万人
    新华社讯　在中国新民主主义青年团改名为中国共产主义青年团的前夕，它的成员已经从1949年初的十九万人发展到目前的二千三百万人，占全国青年总数的19.17％。全国各地的九十二万个团支部，已经成为党在各项工作中的有力助手。
    目前在工业战线上有二百二十八万名青年团员，在农业战线上有一千三百六十七万名青年团员，商业方面有六十八万名团员，文化教育方面的团员有三百六十万名，国家机关和人民团体中的团员有九十七万名，部队及其他方面的团员有一百八十万名。他们在各个战线上，大都能够密切团结青年群众，积极地参加各项建设事业。
    青年团组织是随着各项社会改革和社会主义改造运动迅速发展起来的。青年们在这些运动中受到了很大的锻炼，提高了觉悟。在1949年召开青年团第一次全国代表大会的时候，全国只有十九万团员。经过“三反”、“五反”、镇压反革命、土地改革等各项民主革命运动，参加青年团的人数大大增多。到1953年召开青年团第二次全国代表大会时，团员的人数增加到九百九十万名。从1955年全国社会主义改造进入高潮以来，青年团的组织继续壮大，现在全国团员数目比1953年增加了一千三百一十万名。
    青年团的基层组织分布在全国各地。1953年全国只有三十八万个青年团的基层组织，现在增加了将近一倍半。1953年全国还有10％左右的县没有建立青年团县一级的领导机构，农村还有30％左右的乡、村没有建立团的支部。目前全国各县都有了团的领导机关，农村中广大的乡村和农业生产合作社都普遍建立了团的支部。在商业、手工业及其他企业中，也已经建立了三万五千多个青年团支部。
    现在全国已有六十万名少数民族青年加入了青年团的组织，他们分布在四十五个少数民族中。1953年的时候，在边疆及少数民族地区只是在个别进行过民主改革的地区建立青年团组织，现在绝大多数少数民族地区都建立了团的组织。新疆维吾尔自治区团员人数比1953年增加了六倍多。西藏地区在1956年5月4日开始在藏族青年中建团以后，现在全西藏地区已经有二千七百六十一名团员。云南省边疆地区在1955年发展了少数民族团员四千四百八十名，新建了团支部二百七十七个。甘肃省吴忠回族、甘南藏族、固原回族等自治州及牧区的少数民族团员，已发展到占青年总数的10％以上。
    广大青年妇女经过各种革命斗争的锻炼，积极参加了青年团组织。目前全国青年团员中有六百六十万名女团员，比1953年增加了二倍多。
    几年来，各地青年团组织密切注意对广大团员进行共产主义思想教育，提高了团员的思想觉悟。从1949年建团以来，有大批优秀团员加入了中国共产党。到1956年底，全国已经有二百八十万青年团员入党。
