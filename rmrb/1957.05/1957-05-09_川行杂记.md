Random Notes from a Trip to Sichuan

(Continued from yesterday)

The Demands of People in Mountainous Areas

Sichuan has more than fifty counties that are mountainous, with a population of nearly ten million. Since liberation, the sales of medicinal materials, animal products, and other local specialties have been brisk, and prices have risen, while the prices of industrial products have been declining year by year. This has had a significant impact on improving the lives of people in mountainous areas and promoting production development in these regions.

However, the people in mountainous areas still face a major difficulty that urgently needs to be addressed: transportation. Unless the transportation situation in mountainous areas is further improved, it will be difficult for the people there to better develop production and continue to improve their lives.

Take the Dazhou Special District as an example. The northern part of this district is mostly high mountains and steep ridges, and transportation is extremely inconvenient. Locals describe the roads there as "snakes retreating, ghosts worrying" to describe how difficult they are to traverse. Especially in winter, some roads freeze over and become as slippery as if coated with wax, and careless people can fall to their deaths off cliffs. Local transportation relies entirely on human backs, and many crops and local specialties cannot be transported out. Tongjiang County currently has more than 100 million jin of grain that is difficult to move out; relying on human backs, it would take six years to transport it all. There are many examples of production being affected by the backlog of goods. For example, in Junlian County, because live pigs could not be transported out in 1954, prices fell, and the number of pigs raised in 1955 decreased by 13%. As for lower-value local specialties such as timber, bamboo, chestnuts, walnuts, ginkgo, rosin... and some medicinal materials, the phenomenon of goods being abandoned is even more widespread. Therefore, some cadres in mountainous areas say that they would rather the state use the money for price increases of certain products from mountainous areas to improve transportation; some people in mountainous areas also say that if the government wants to build roads, they would rather contribute voluntary labor.

However, mountainous areas are sparsely populated and road construction requires particularly large investments. Solving the transportation problem in mountainous areas cannot be achieved in the short term. Therefore, while making every effort to build roads, we should not neglect to solve some problems that can be solved at present, and help the people in mountainous areas develop production and improve their lives as quickly as possible. This is entirely possible. For example, many material circulation routes in mountainous areas currently do not conform to the economic interests of the local people. For example, in the northern Sichuan mountainous areas, many local specialties used to flow to southern Shaanxi or be exported to Hubei via the Han River, but now they have to be transported to Chengdu or Chongqing. This reduces the income of the local people and increases the burden on transportation capacity. The transportation routes within the province, special districts, and counties also have similar situations, which need to be studied and adjusted. Last year, the Grain Department of Dazhou Special District opened 114 cross-boundary transportation routes. The result of implementing cross-boundary grain transportation into warehouses in 336 villages in Qu County alone saved the state more than 35,000 yuan in transportation costs and reduced the burden of many transportation laborers. This experience is well worth emulating by other departments and other regions.

Due to the difficulty of transportation, sparse population, and different climate conditions compared to the plains, the planning of production in mountainous areas should pay attention to their characteristics. Moreover, mountainous areas have many local specialties such as medicinal materials, animal products, tung seeds, tea, etc., which are urgently needed both domestically and abroad. If attention is paid to developing them, it will not only benefit the country but also increase the income of people in mountainous areas relatively quickly. At the Sichuan Provincial Agricultural Exhibition, we saw a material: Xianfeng Agricultural Cooperative in Baoxing County (high mountain area), after becoming an advanced cooperative, utilized its advantageous conditions, and in addition to striving to increase grain production (grain production increased by 23% in 1956), it also paid attention to developing diversified operations, planting 5,000 pepper trees, 2,000 castor bean plants, raising more than 100 sheep, raising 25 barrels of bees, planting 30,000 trees, and actively organizing pig raising, medicinal herb digging, and lime burning and other sideline production. In 1956, the total output value of agricultural and sideline industries increased by 47% compared to the previous year. This typical example seems to be the direction of production development in mountainous areas in the future.

New Situations Facing the Catering and Service Industries

In Sichuan, for more than a month, from Chengdu and Chongqing to various county towns and market towns, we have seen an unprecedented prosperity in the catering and service industries. Moreover, it seems that the current state of the catering and service industries is somewhat incompatible with the new situation of improved living standards for urban and rural people and the rapid development of industrial, mining, and transportation enterprises. From the perspective of the catering industry, whether it is state-owned, joint state-private, cooperative canteens, or decentralized cooperative groups, almost everywhere there are no empty seats, and some canteens often sell out their food very early.

In a situation of crowded customers and demand exceeding supply, many catering businesses cut corners to obtain exorbitant profits. According to a survey in Luzhou City, 18 out of 27 catering businesses reduced quality and quantity; 20 out of 35 dessert businesses reduced quality and quantity; most reduced the quantity by 30% to 40%, and a few even reduced it by 60% to 70%. Even some small family shops can earn a net profit of more than 200 yuan per month.

Hotels are even more of a nightmare for travelers. Some of our comrades arrived in Neijiang County town at 12 o'clock at night. They and dozens of other people who got off the train together went to look for hotels, but they could not find a place to stay after running all over the city. All the hotels were full, and the dining halls, bathrooms, and doorways of the larger hotels were full of people lying or sitting. According to Chengdu City statistics, there are 453 hotels in the city, with 7,912 beds. However, a survey on January 10 showed that the city's hotels accommodated 18,283 people, which was extremely crowded.

Bathhouses, barber shops, photo studios, etc., are also very crowded in many places, and the quality of service has also declined.

To improve the state of the catering and service industries, it will certainly involve difficult and complex issues such as national investment, the supply of grain and non-staple foods, the blind influx of farmers into cities, and the excessive growth of the urban population. However, we have also seen some places create some methods that are beneficial to solving this problem. For example, the Dazhu County People's Committee organized demobilized soldiers and the families of revolutionary martyrs to use their demobilization pay and preferential treatment fees to establish a fairly large-scale "Revolutionary Martyr and Military Dependents Restaurant and Hotel," which not only facilitated the food and lodging of travelers but also properly arranged the lives and work of demobilized soldiers and the families of revolutionary martyrs. In Chongqing and Yibin, we also saw two large hotels (with bathrooms and restaurants), which were said to have been established by organizing wholesale merchants to transfer their investment. I think that it is possible for various places to emulate this way of organizing scattered social funds to solve the investment problem of the catering and service industries.

We learned that many government agencies and organizations have long occupied hotels. For example, in Chengdu, government agencies and organizations occupy 21 large hotels as guest houses and family dormitories, with beds roughly equivalent to one-fifth of the current operating beds; the utilization rate of various units' guest houses is extremely low. The hotels occupied by government agencies and organizations should be returned for business use.

In terms of food supply, many places mix 20% to 30% sweet potatoes into rice, extending the food supply time. Bai Township in Yibin mixes 40% to 60% sweet potatoes into noodles, steamed buns, and wonton skins, and uses sweet potatoes to make vermicelli, which is very popular among farmers. In some places, after the day's quota of food is sold out, travelers with grain coupons are still supplied to ensure the needs of travelers.

Although these experiences and situations are still very sporadic, they have given us a lot of inspiration and confidence in improving the current situation of the catering and service industries.

Now, the State Council has established the Ministry of Urban Services, and various places should also quickly establish specialized management agencies for the catering and service industries or further assign relevant departments to concurrently manage them, to systematically strengthen leadership in this area.

    川行杂记
    方白天
    （续昨）
    山区人民的要求
    四川有五十多个县是山区，人口近一千万。解放以来，药材、畜产和其它土特产品畅销、价格上涨，而工业品价格逐年下降，这对改善山区人民生活、促进山区生产发展有着不小的作用。
    但是，山区人民还有一个重大的困难迫切需要解决，这就是交通运输问题。山区的交通运输情况不进一步改进，山区人民就不能更好地发展生产，生活也难继续提高。
    拿达县专区来说，这个专区的北部，多是崇山峻岭，交通异常不便，当地人以“蛇倒退，鬼见愁”来形容那里道路的难走。尤其是冬天，有些路冻了，就像涂了一层油蜡一样，不小心就会跌死崖下。当地的运输，完全靠人背，许多农作物和土特产品运不出来。现在通江县就有一亿多斤粮食难以调出，靠人背，要六年的时间才能运完。由于积压物资而影响生产的例子很多。如筠连县1954年因生猪运不出，价格下降，1955年养猪头数就减少了13％。至于价值较低的土特产如木材、竹子、栗子、核桃、白果、松香……及一些药材等，货弃于地的现象更是普遍。因此，有些山区干部说，宁愿国家把对山区某些产品提价的钱用来改善交通运输情况；有些山区人民也说，如果政府要修筑道路，他们宁愿出义务工。
    但是山区地广人稀，修路所需投资特别大，要解决山区的交通运输问题不是短时期内能够实现的，因此在尽力修筑道路的同时，还应该不放松解决一些现时能够解决的问题，尽可能快地帮助山区人民发展生产和改善生活。这是完全可能做到的。例如：目前山区有许多物资流转路线不符合当地人民的经济利益。像川北山区，原来许多土特产品是流往陕南或经汉水输出湖北的，而现在则要往成都或重庆调运。这样，就减少了当地人民的收入，并增加许多运输力的负担。省内、专区内、县内的运输路线，也同样有这种情况，都需要加以研究调整。达县专区粮食部门曾在去年开辟了一百一十四条跨界运输路线，仅渠县三百三十六个村子实行破界运粮入库的结果，就节省了国家运费三万五千多元，并减少了许多运输劳力的负担。这个经验很值得其它部门和其它地区仿行。
    由于山区运输困难、人口稀少以及气候等条件和平原不同，对山区生产的规划应注意它们的特点。而且，山区有许多土特产如药材、畜产品及桐籽、茶叶等等，国内国外都迫切需要，如果注意加以发展，既有利于国家，又能比较快地增加山区人民的收入。我们在四川省农业展览会上看到一个材料：宝兴县先锋农业社（高山地区）在转为高级社后，利用了优越的条件，除努力增产粮食（1956年粮食增产23％）外，并注意开展多种经营，种了五千株花椒树、两千株蓖麻，养羊一百多只，养蜂二十五桶，造林三万株，又积极组织了养猪、挖药及烧石灰等副业生产，1956年农副业总产值比上年增加了47％。这个典型，似乎应该成为今后山区生产发展的方向。
    饮食和服务业面临的新情况
    在四川的一个多月中，我们从成都、重庆到各个县城和集镇，看到饮食业和服务业的盛况是空前的。而且，看来当前饮食、服务业的现状，已经和城乡人民生活改善、工矿交通事业迅速发展的新形势有些不相适应了。从饮食业来讲，无论公营、公私合营、合作食堂或分散经营的合作小组，几乎到处是席无虚座，而且有些食堂往往很早就把饭食卖完了。
    在顾客拥挤、供不应求的情况下，不少饮食业户就偷工减料获取暴利，据沪州市调查，饮食业二十七户中有十八户降质降量；甜食业三十五户中有二十户降质降量；大部分比定量降低30％到40％，少数的竟降低60％到70％。连有些家庭小铺每月也能获纯利二百余元。
    旅店更是行人的畏途。我们有几个同志于夜间十二时到达内江县城，他们同一起下火车的几十个人一块去找旅馆，结果跑遍全城也没有找到住处。旅店是家家客满，较大旅馆的饭堂、浴室和门洞里都躺满或坐满人。另据成都市统计，全市共有旅店四百五十三家，床位七千九百一十二张。但1月10日调查，全市旅店却容纳了一万八千二百八十三人，拥挤不堪。
    澡塘、理发馆、照像馆等，许多地方也是非常拥挤的，而且服务质量也下降了。
    要改进饮食业和服务业的状况，当然就会牵涉到国家的投资、粮食和副食品的供应、农民盲目进城以及城市人口增长过快等等困难而复杂的问题。但是，我们也看到有些地方创造出一些办法，对解决这个问题是有利的。例如，大竹县人民委员会组织转业军人和军烈属拿出退役金和优抚费，建立了一个规模相当大的“烈军属餐旅社”，既便利了往来行人的食宿，又妥善安排了转业军人和烈军属的生活和工作问题。在重庆和宜宾，我们也看到有两个很大的旅馆（带浴室、餐厅），据说是组织批发商转业投资建立的。像这样组织社会零散资金来解决饮食、服务业的投资问题，我想各地是可以仿行的。
    我们了解到，不少机关团体长期占用旅馆。如成都市机关团体占用了二十一个大旅馆作为招待所及家属宿舍，其床位约等于现在营业床位的五分之一；各单位的招待所利用率极低。应该把机关团体所占用的旅馆退回作为营业之用。
    在饭食供应方面，有许多地方在米饭里掺20％到30％的红苕，延长了饭食的供应时间。宜宾柏镇在面条、馍馍、抄手皮里掺40％到60％的红苕和用红苕做粉条，很受农民欢迎。有的地方，在当天定量的饭食卖完以后，对有粮票的旅客照常供应，保证往来行人的需要。
    这些经验和情况，虽然还很零星，但对我们改进饮食业和服务业的现状，却给了不少的启发和信心。
    现在，国务院已经成立了城市服务部，各地也应迅速建立饮食、服务业的专管机构或进一步责成有关部门兼管，以有系统地来加强对这方面工作的领导。　（完）
