Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 22nd - Our reporter Gu Weijin reports: Hubei Province's more than 30 million mu of summer harvest crops are expected to have a comprehensive bumper harvest this year. The province's 2.3 million mu of rapeseed has an average yield of approximately 75 jin per mu, an increase of 110% compared to last year. Last year, the Provincial People's Committee raised the purchase price of oil crops by 40%, which increased farmers' enthusiasm for production. The rapeseed planting area in various places expanded, and improved rapeseed varieties were promoted and cultivated, finally achieving a great harvest.

The province's 17 million mu of wheat is expected to increase the average yield per mu from 112 jin last year to about 125 jin. The 7.2 million mu of barley has an average yield of 120 jin per mu, an increase of more than 40% compared to last year. Broad beans, peas, potatoes, and minor grains will also have a substantial increase in production compared to last year. The increase in production of various coarse grains can play a significant role in solving the difficulties of grain-deficient households in rural areas and resolving the problem of pig feed. The province's total summer grain output is expected to be 3,736 million jin, an increase of more than 11% compared to last year. Timely sowing, close planting, promotion of improved varieties, and sufficient fertilization last year are the main reasons for this year's summer grain harvest.

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 19th - The harvest of Fujian Province's more than 5 million mu of spring harvest crops has basically ended. According to preliminary statistics from the Provincial Bureau of Statistics, the province's production of wheat, broad beans, peas, potatoes, and rapeseed has increased compared to last year. The production of barley and sweet potatoes has decreased compared to last year due to the reduction in planting area. The province's total spring harvest grain crop output is approximately 616 million jin, equivalent to 97.6% of last year's unprecedented bumper harvest level. The total output of oil crops (rapeseed) has increased by 8.2% compared to last year.

    湖北夏收作物全面丰收有望
    福建春收粮食作物比去年略减，油菜籽产量比去年增加
    本报汉口22日电　本报记者古维进报道：今年湖北省三千多万亩夏收作物可望全面丰收。全省二百三十万亩油菜，平均单位面积产量约七十五斤，比去年增产110％，去年省人民委员会提高油料作物收购价格40％，提高了农民的生产积极性，各地油菜播种面积扩大了，并且推广了油菜良种，加工培育，终于得到了大丰收。
    全省一千七百万亩小麦，预计平均单位面积产量可由去年的每亩一百一十二斤，增至一百二十五斤左右；七百二十万亩大麦平均每亩产量一百二十斤，比去年增产40％以上，蚕豆、豌豆、洋芋、小杂粮都要比去年大量增产。各种杂粮的增产，对于解决农村缺粮户的困难和解决养猪饲料问题可以起很大作用。全省夏收粮食总产量预计为三十七亿三千六百万斤，比去年增产11％以上。去年适时播种、密植、推广良种、施足肥料等，是今年夏季粮食丰收的主要原因。
    新华社福州19日电　福建省五百多万亩春收作物的收获工作已经基本结束。据省统计局的初步统计：全省小麦、蚕豆、豌豆、马铃薯和油菜籽的产量都比去年增加，大麦和甘薯因种植面积缩小而产量比去年有所减少。全省春收粮食作物总产量约达六亿一千六百多万斤，相当于去年空前丰收水平的97.6％，油料作物（油菜籽）总产量比去年增加8.2％。
