Blindly Bringing Family Members into the City Causes Many Problems
    Zhong Changshou Huang Yiqing Shen Genyun
    In the past year, more and more staff members of organs and enterprises in Shaodong County, Hunan Province, have been bringing their family members to the city. According to preliminary understanding, 1,083 family members have moved in with 2,280 staff members of county organs and enterprises, accounting for 47.5% of the total number of staff members. For example, the industrial and transportation system has a total of 465 staff members, and 448 family members have moved in, accounting for 96.3% of the total number of staff members. The number of family members in the postal and telecommunications bureau exceeds the total number of employees: the bureau has a total of 45 employees, but 79 family members have moved in. Most of the family members who have moved to the city are young and strong women. Among them are Party members, League members, cooperative cadres, and activists.

    After these people left production and came to the city, they wandered around and idled their days away, which not only affected agricultural production but also created a negative impact among the masses. For example, the wife of a comrade in the county transportation section hired someone to carry water after moving in, and she rode her bicycle around idly every day. The wife of a comrade in the county Party committee office moved in even though her home was only two miles away from the county seat. The wife of a comrade in the agriculture bureau was the deputy director of the Luojia elementary agricultural cooperative, the director of the township women's federation, and a Communist Party member. Now, she has no other work to do besides cooking and taking care of her children. Xu Zhuo, a staff member of the supply and marketing cooperative, brought his wife, mother-in-law, sister-in-law, and sister-in-law to tear rags for the supply and marketing cooperative, earning six jiao for every 100 jin torn. Nearby residents complained: "The good and big ones are given to the family members to tear, and they can earn a yuan or so a day, while we only earn three or four jiao. The family members of cadres dress well and eat well. The more family members of cadres come, the worse our lives become." The Tangxia Qiao Coal Mine currently has ten family members, all of whom are young women without children. They rarely do anything besides playing poker. Huang Huifang, the wife of a comrade in the pharmaceutical company, used to be the deputy director of an agricultural cooperative and worked actively. But now? She doesn't even go to meetings called by the neighborhood committee.

    Some staff members do not go to work on time after bringing their family members, which affects their work. Some do not distinguish between public and private matters in their lives, which has a very bad impact. Xie Ren, the president of the court, lives with his wife and two children in the office (sometimes even his mother-in-law comes). The whole family sits in the office all day long, warming themselves by the fire and chatting about family matters, which makes comrades feel uncomfortable. It is sometimes difficult to contact him for work. His wife is somewhat fond of petty gains, sometimes burning public firewood and using public water, which makes all the comrades in the court dissatisfied. Zeng Yintian, a bailiff in the court, saw that others were bringing their families, so he also wanted to bring his wife to live in the office. He said, "If the leaders can live here, so can I." The wives of Yin Yuhua, the deputy director of the public security bureau, and others also live in the office. Some people privately commented, "The director's wife lives in the office without paying rent, but we have to pay rent outside!" After many people brought their family members to the city, their demands in life also increased. For example, Luo Shucai of the food and sundry company earns more than 29 yuan a month. He brought his wife and sister-in-law, and his wife dresses very luxuriously. He has no money to spend, so he asks for subsidies everywhere. Zhang Ziliang, the personnel section chief of the tax bureau, and his wife have a monthly income of 115 yuan. They have two children, but now they have brought their mother-in-law, sister-in-law, and two younger brothers (one brother is 23 years old). They spend money without saving, and the couple each made a leather robe costing more than 40 yuan. He often asks the finance and trade department, the personnel section, and the leaders of his bureau for subsidies, saying, "If you don't subsidize me when I have difficulties, do you want me to sleep in a grass nest? I earn 70 yuan a month, which I earned with a gun." Yan Jiachen of the department store has two children, but his monthly salary is 29 yuan. From September of last year to now, he has received two subsidies totaling 40 yuan, and he still owes more than 40 yuan. Zhao Zi of the grain bureau wrote several letters to the leaders of the bureau asking for subsidies. The leaders believed that his family of four had a monthly income of 50 yuan and had no special difficulties, so he should not be subsidized. He became dissatisfied with the leaders. The wife of Yue Jin, the deputy director of the Tangxia Qiao Coal Mine, and the wife of a section chief quarreled over subsidies, saying, "I said you shouldn't be subsidized, and you said I shouldn't be subsidized," which had a very bad impact on the masses.

    The ideological awareness of some people has also begun to deteriorate. Chen Liren of the public security bureau did not send money home after bringing his wife, and his father even went to the public security bureau to complain. A few people violated state laws and embezzled and stole because they did not have enough money to meet their wives' demands. For example, Hou Aiqing of the timber company earns more than 30 yuan a month. His wife was a labor force at home, but after moving here, she wanted to eat well and dress well (she has already borrowed three or four zhang of cloth coupons). In order to satisfy her desire for enjoyment, Hou embezzled 370 yuan of public funds. Dai Rongrui of the grain bureau embezzled more than 800 jin of rice and more than 200 jin of rice. Zhao Congzhen's wife from the Qunli Coal Mine often wanted to eat eggs, and when she didn't have enough money, she stole many meal tickets from the general affairs section.

    The number of family members of staff members is increasing day by day. What is the reason? We believe that the main reasons are: First, organs and enterprises excessively emphasize welfare and build too many family dormitories, which fosters a bad habit of relying on the public for everything. Some people's family members did not originally plan to move in, but when they heard that the government had built houses specifically for them, they also moved in "with the crowd." For example, eight of the 23 family members of the postal and telecommunications bureau moved in this way. Second, the family members of staff members are not content with agricultural production and have the wrong ideas of "a wife is honored by her husband's success" and greed for ease and comfort. Everyone wants to go to the city to "enjoy happiness."

    From the above situation, the blind influx of family members of staff members into the city has a very bad impact, whether from the perspective of agricultural production or from the perspective of the relationship between the Party and the masses. From the perspective of personal economic burden, it is also unfavorable. We suggest that staff members, including leaders, who have brought their family members to the city, mobilize their family members to return to rural production as much as possible, based on the actual situation and possibilities, as long as their family members have the conditions to return to rural production. In the future, leadership organs at all levels must properly review the matter of staff members bringing their family members and stop the blind influx of family members into the city.

    盲目接家属进城害处多
    钟长寿　黄亦清　申根云
    近一年来，湖南省邵东县机关、企业工作人员接家属的愈来愈多。据初步了解，县机关、企业的二千二百八十名工作人员已迁来家属一千零八十三人，占工作人员总数的47.5％。如工业交通系统共有四百六十五名工作人员，已迁来家属四百四十八人，占工作人员总数96.3％。邮电局家属则超过了职工总数：全局共有职工四十五人，但家属就迁来七十九人。迁来城镇的家属多数是年轻力壮的妇女。她们当中有党员、团员、社干部和积极分子。
    这些人脱离生产来到城镇以后，东游西荡，逍遥度日，既影响了农业生产，又在群众中造成了不良影响。如县交通科的一个同志的爱人迁来以后，连水都雇人挑，她每天骑自行车闲跑。县委办公室的一位同志的家离县城只有两里路，他也把爱人迁来了。农业局的一位同志的爱人，是罗家初级农业社副主任、乡妇联主任、共产党员，现在每天除了煮饭、抱小孩，就没别的工作了。供销合作社的工作人员许斫，把爱人、岳母、姨妹、嫂子都接来，让她们给供销社扯烂布，每扯一百斤得六角钱。附近的居民们不满地说：“好的大的归家属扯了，她们一天能得块把钱，我们不过三四角钱，干部家属穿得好，吃得好，干部家属来的越多，我们的生活越差了。”棠下乔煤矿现有十户家属，都是没子女的年轻妇女，她们除了打扑克，很少做事情。药材公司的一个同志的爱人黄惠方，原是农业社副主任，工作积极，现在呢？居民会喊她开会都不去了。
    有些工作人员接来家属以后，不按时上下班，影响了工作。有的在生活上公私不分，影响很坏，法院院长谢仁，爱人和两个小孩都住在机关里（有时连岳母也来了），全家整天坐在办公室烤火，谈家常，同志们感到不方便，要去联系工作有时也不好。他的爱人有些爱小利，有时烧公家的柴，爱用公家的水，全院同志纷纷不满。法院有个法警曾银田看到别人都接家眷，也要把爱人接来放机关住，他说：“领导上住得，我也住得。”公安局副局长尹玉华等的爱人也在机关里住，有人私下议论说：“局长爱人在机关住，不要房租，我们在外面住却要房租！”许多人把家属接到城镇以后，生活上的要求也多了。如食品杂货公司的罗树材，每月收入二十九元多，他把爱人和姨妹都接来了，爱人穿的很阔气，他没有钱花，就到处要求补助。税务局人事股长张子良，夫妇每月有一百一十五元的收入，他们有两个小孩，现在把岳母、姨妹和两个弟弟（一个弟弟二十三岁）都接来了，花钱又不节省，两口子各办起四十多块钱一件的皮袍子。他经常向财贸部、人事科和本局领导同志要求补助。并说：“我有困难不补助，要我睡草窝不成，我七十块钱一个月，是枪杆子打出来的。”百货公司颜家臣的爱人，带来了两个小孩，可是他每月工资是二十九元，从去年9月到现在，他已经得到两次补助，共四十元，现在还欠债四十多元。粮食局赵资写了几封信给局的领导同志，要求补助，领导同志认为他家四口人，每月有五十元的收入，又没有什么特殊困难，不应补助，他就对领导同志不满起来。棠下乔煤矿的副矿长岳仅的爱人同一位股长的爱人因补助吵架，我说你不应该补助，你说我不应该补助，这样对群众影响极坏。
    有些人的思想意识也开始变坏了。公安局的陈立仁接来爱人以后不寄钱回家，父亲还闹到公安局。有少数人因钱少不能满足爱人要求，竟违犯国家法律，贪污盗窃。如木材公司的侯爱卿，每月工资三十多元，爱人在家是劳动力，迁来这里后，要吃好的，穿好的（已经借了三、四丈布票），侯为了满足她的享受欲望，贪污了公款三百七十元。粮食局的戴荣瑞，贪污了八百多斤米、二百多斤稻谷。群力煤矿的赵从珍的爱人经常要吃鸡蛋，自己的钱不够，他就偷了总务股的很多饭票。
    工作人员家属来的一天一天多了，究竟是什么原因呢？我们认为主要原因是：第一，各机关、企业过分强调福利，过多地新建家属宿舍，助长了一种事事依赖公家的坏风气。有些人的家属原先并不打算迁来住的，但听说政府专门为他们修好房子，也就“随大流”迁来了。如邮电局的二十三户家属中，就有八户是这样迁来的。第二，工作人员的家属不安心农业生产，有着“夫荣妻贵”、贪图安逸的错误思想，大家都要进城镇“享福”。
    从以上情况来看，工作人员家属盲目流入城市，不论从农业生产上看，或者从党与群众的关系上看，都有很坏的影响，而从个人的经济负担来说，也是不利的。我们建议接家属到城镇的工作人员，包括领导人员在内，根据实际情况和可能，凡是家属有条件回到农村生产的，尽可能动员回家生产。各级领导机关今后对于工作人员接家属的事，必须适当审查，制止家属盲目流入城市。
