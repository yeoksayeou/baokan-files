Xinhua News Agency, 9th dispatch: The Party Group of the Ministry of Supervision of the Communist Party of China recently held three consecutive meetings to discuss the key issues of rectification in the supervisory departments.

The Party Group of the Ministry of Supervision believes that, because the supervisory organs mainly struggle against various errors and shortcomings, this rectification should focus on examining the problems existing in the implementation of the "unity—criticism—unity" and "learning from past mistakes to avoid future ones, curing the sickness to save the patient" policies; examining the situations where the supervisory departments' inspection work lacks investigation and research and a spirit of seeking truth from facts, resulting in the determination of impractical inspection items, superficial inspection work, incomplete views, and inappropriate conclusions, and thus uncoordinated relationships with relevant departments; examining the situation where the efficiency of handling citizens' reports and accusations does not meet the urgent demands of the people, and some cases are not handled in a timely manner, or are not thoroughly investigated and seriously dealt with, causing dissatisfaction among the people; examining the shortcomings existing in guiding the work of lower-level supervisory organs and the problems existing between leaders and those being led within the supervisory organs, and between party members and non-party members. During the examination, specific issues must be used to grasp the key points and conduct in-depth research and analysis.

The Party Group of the Ministry of Supervision pointed out that, through this rectification, it is also necessary to further study and resolve issues related to the tasks, scope of authority, methods, and systems of the supervisory organs, as well as the organizational division of labor and work systems within the Ministry of Supervision.

    贯彻执行惩前毖后治病救人方针
    监察部党组讨论整风重点
    据新华社9日讯　中共监察部党组在最近连续召开三次会议，讨论监察部门的整风重点问题。
    监察部党组认为，由于监察机关主要是和各种错误和缺点作斗争，这一次整风要着重检查贯彻执行“团结—批评—团结”和“惩前毖后，治病救人”的方针中存在的问题；检查监察部门在检查工作中由于缺乏调查研究和实事求是的精神，确定检查项目不切合实际、检查工作不深入、看问题不全面、结论不恰当，因而同有关部门的关系不协调的情况；检查处理公民检举控诉案件的效率和人民群众的迫切要求不相适应，有些案件处理得不及时或检查得不彻底、处理得不严肃，引起人民群众不满的情况；检查指导下级监察机关工作中存在的缺点和监察机关内部领导和被领导之间、党员和非党群众之间存在的问题。在检查时，必须通过具体问题，抓住重点，进行深入的研究分析。
    监察部党组指出，通过这一次整风，还要进一步研究和解决监察机关工作的任务、职权范围、作法和体制问题，以及监察部内的组织分工和工作制度问题。
