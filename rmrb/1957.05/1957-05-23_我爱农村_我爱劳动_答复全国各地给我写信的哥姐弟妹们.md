I Love the Countryside, I Love Labor
    ——A Reply to Brothers, Sisters, and Younger Siblings Across the Country Who Wrote to Me
    Editor's Note: Comrade He Qinglian, a feeder at the Quantang Agricultural Cooperative in Xiangtan County, Hunan Province, wrote to this newspaper saying: "Since returning from the National Agricultural Model Workers Representative Conference in Beijing, I have been constantly receiving many letters. The majority of the letter writers are young students, rural cadres, People's Liberation Army soldiers, and members of agricultural cooperatives. These letters come from all parts of the motherland. This is a great encouragement to me. I really want to reply to each letter; but there are so many letters, I can't find the time to answer them one by one. Therefore, I have written this reply letter to send to you and requested it to be published in the newspaper." What is published here is her reply letter.

Dear brothers, sisters, and younger siblings! Comrades!

Since returning from Beijing, I have been constantly receiving your letters. First of all, let me thank you for your care and help.

Each of your letters brings me infinite warmth and gives me great strength. The younger brothers and sisters studying at school say: "Study for the motherland and go to the most needed place in the motherland – the countryside." Comrades working in the countryside say: "Make up your mind to work in the countryside for a lifetime." The older brothers and sisters of the agricultural cooperative believe that the agricultural cooperative is the road to happiness. You say well: "Cherish the agricultural cooperative as you cherish your own life." The soldiers also expressed their determination to resolutely defend the socialist cause. How loud your words are, how firm your determination is, how much you love life and the countryside, how can I not be encouraged!

Indeed, the countryside is beautiful. I am a girl who grew up in the countryside. I love the countryside, especially the countryside after collectivization, I love my home – the agricultural cooperative, I love the enthusiastic working members, I love the continuous fields, I even love to hear the grunting of the piglets. Because I have found happiness here; there is even greater happiness hidden here, waiting for us to develop. There is a great attraction here attracting me. Although my hand is broken, I am not pessimistic, I am not in pain. Because I can still work, I can still create happiness here. Younger siblings who are willing to come to the countryside, come! This place needs educated youth, this place needs culture, let's build a happy countryside together! I welcome you! Comrades working in the countryside, we still have some difficulties ahead, we ask for your help, we are eager to make progress. If it weren't for the agricultural cooperative, how could a woman like me, who has lost her husband, have such happiness? Let us work together to make the agricultural cooperative even better!

I returned to the cooperative on March 13th. That day, as soon as I arrived at the cooperative, I saw the members actively turning the fields and soaking the paddies, determined to strive for a bumper harvest this year. They warmly welcomed me, vying to ask how Chairman Mao was doing, and asking how the cooperative would be run this year. They also said to me kindly: "Qinglian, work hard, and make even greater achievements next year!" I was very happy, I was so excited that I almost shed tears. The cooperative also held a welcome meeting for me, with a particularly large number of members attending, and people from neighboring cooperatives also rushed over. At the meeting, I told them that Chairman Mao was very kind and healthy, and told them that the Party Central Committee asked me to do a good job in agricultural production, grow more grain, engage in more sideline occupations, and raise more and fatter pigs. The members were very happy to hear this and were full of energy. They said: "We must have a bumper harvest this year and send good news to Chairman Mao in the autumn." The feeders in our pigsty are determined to raise pigs well and strive to become models.

I feel that I have not done anything for the people. Even if I have made a little achievement, it has been achieved under the cultivation of the Party and the cooperative and with the help of the members. I have nothing to be praised for.

I just want to:

Dedicate my heart to the agricultural cooperative and to socialism.

I am still young, I am not disabled, I can do more work, I want to do more work.

I want to raise pigs well, so that sows have more piglets and piglets grow fat. I am not familiar with pig raising, I want to learn more and strive to become a pig raising expert.

Comrades! Let us join hands and advance bravely on the road of building socialism! I wish you eternal victory!

    我爱农村　我爱劳动
    ——答复全国各地给我写信的哥姐弟妹们
    编者按　湖南省湘潭县泉塘农业社饲养员贺庆莲同志给本报来信说：“从北京参加全国农业劳模代表会议回来以后，不断收到很多来信。写信的人大多数是青年学生、农村干部、解放军战士和农业社社员。这些信件，来自祖国的各个地方。这对我来说是很大的鼓舞。我很想回信；但来信很多，我找不出时间来一一答复。因此，写了这一封复信，寄给你们，要求在报上发表。”这里发表的就是她的复信。亲爱的哥姐弟妹们！同志们！
    从北京回来后，不断接到你们的来信，首先，让我谢谢你们对我的关怀和帮助。
    你们的每一封信，都为我带来了无限的温暖，也给我很大的力量。在学校学习的弟弟妹妹们说：“为祖国而学习，到祖国最需要的地方——农村去。”在农村工作的同志们说：“下定决心，要在农村干一辈子。”农业社的哥哥姐姐们认为农业社是通向幸福的大道，你们说得好：“要像爱护自己的生命一样爱护农业社。”战士们也表示他的决心，坚决保卫社会主义事业。你们的语言是多么的响亮，你们的决心是多么的坚定，你们热爱生活，热爱农村，叫我怎能不受到鼓舞呢！
    的确，农村是美丽的。我是一个生长在农村中的姑娘。我爱农村，特别是爱合作化后的农村，我爱我的家——农业社，我爱热情劳动的社员们，我爱连片的田地，我甚至爱听小猪呱呱唧唧的叫声。因为从这里我得到了幸福；这里还蕴藏着更大的幸福，待我们去开发。这里有很大的吸引力吸引着我。虽然我的手断了，但我不悲观，我不痛苦。因为我还能劳动，我还能在这里创造幸福。愿意到农村来的弟妹们，你们来吧！这里正需要知识青年，这里需要文化，一道来建设幸福的农村吧！我欢迎你们！在农村工作的同志们，我们面前还有些困难，要求你们帮助，我们是急于要进步的。像我一个死了丈夫的妇女，要不是有了农业社，怎会有这样的幸福呢？我们共同来把农业社办得更好吧！
    3月13日我回到了社里。那天，一到社，看到社员们在积极地翻田、沤凼，他们决心争取今年的大丰收，他们热情地欢迎我，争着问毛主席好，问今年社里要如何办。还慈祥地对我说：“庆莲，好好的干吧，明年还要做出更大的成绩啊！”我很高兴，我真激动得要流泪，社里还为我开了个欢迎大会，社员到的特别多，邻社的人也赶来了，在会上我告诉他们毛主席很慈祥，很健康，告诉他们党中央要求我搞好农业生产多打粮，多搞副业，猪要喂得多，长得肥。社员们听到都很欢喜，劲头很足。他们说：“今年一定要来一个大丰收，到秋后给毛主席捎个喜讯。”我们猪舍的饲养员，决心养好猪，争取当模范。
    我觉得我没有为人民做什么，即使有一点儿成绩，也是在党和社的培养下，社员帮助下所取得的，我没有值得人夸奖的地方。
    我只想：
    把我这颗心献给农业社，献给社会主义。
    我还年青，我不是残废者，我能做更多的工作，我要做更多的工作。
    我要把猪养好，使母猪产仔多，小猪长得胖。我对养猪并不熟悉，我要更多地学习，争取做一个养猪能手。
    同志们！携起手来，在建设社会主义的道路上，勇敢地前进吧！祝你们永远胜利！
