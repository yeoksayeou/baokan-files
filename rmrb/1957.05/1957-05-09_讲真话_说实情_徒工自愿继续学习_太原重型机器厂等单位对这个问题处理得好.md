	Telling the Truth, Speaking Facts: Apprentices Voluntarily Continue Learning – Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant and Other Units Handle This Issue Well
	(Our Dispatch) The Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant, Qingdao Sifang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Plant, and Beijing First Machine Tool Plant have recently properly resolved the issue of apprentice workers postponing their worker assessment and upgrade, stabilizing the learning mood of the apprentice workers.
	These three factories recruited many apprentice workers last year. At that time, the leaders of each factory, in accordance with the regulations of the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry, announced to the apprentice workers that they would be trained to become third-grade technical workers within one year. The Sifang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Plant also announced that those with excellent performance and who passed the worker assessment could graduate ahead of schedule. Therefore, the apprentice workers actively strived to graduate on schedule or ahead of schedule, and many even planned their living expenses after graduation. However, in March of this year, just as the apprentice workers were anxiously waiting for the worker assessment and upgrade, the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry issued another instruction saying that due to the adjustment of the scale and speed of national construction this year, there was already a surplus of existing workers, and the apprentice workers would not graduate for the time being this year. After receiving the instructions, some factories did not know how to explain to the apprentice workers, fearing that a poor explanation would provoke unanimous opposition from the apprentice workers. Therefore, when the apprentice workers inquired about why the worker assessment and upgrade were not on schedule, they used reasons such as "busy with production tasks, no time" to prevaricate. Some factories simply copied the superior's instructions onto the blackboard newspaper, causing great dissatisfaction among the apprentice workers.
	After studying Chairman Mao's speech on the correct handling of contradictions among the people, the leaders of each factory realized that this was a matter of contradictions among the people and that they must tell everyone the truth. Therefore, they explained to the apprentices: The state's training of technical workers is based on production needs. This year's production tasks do not actually require so many technical workers. If all apprentices are forcibly converted into formal workers, the state will have to spend a lot more differential wages. Apprentice workers should subordinate personal interests to national interests. Each factory also explained to the apprentice workers: It is, in fact, impossible to train someone who does not understand technology at all into a third-grade technical worker within one year. Last year's regulation by the higher authorities was relatively subjective. At the same time, a young person should concentrate on mastering knowledge and technology during their apprenticeship and should not haggle over treatment and grades.
	While conducting persuasive education, each factory also properly handled the reasonable demands and difficulties raised by the apprentice workers. For example, the Sifang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Plant signed an agreement with apprentice workers who had been transferred to transportation workers, giving them priority when the need for production workers increased in the future; the trade union would provide appropriate relief to those with real family difficulties.
	After this work, the vast majority of apprentice workers expressed satisfaction with the temporary postponement of the upgrade examination. They said, if the country has difficulties, why didn't you tell us the truth earlier? If you had said it earlier, we would have understood earlier. An apprentice worker named Wang Yaotang from the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant said: "I started by thinking about money, not thinking about whether I could do it. My master is still a third-grade worker, and his skills are much higher than mine!"

### 讲真话　说实情　徒工自愿继续学习  太原重型机器厂等单位对这个问题处理得好

    讲真话　说实情　徒工自愿继续学习
    太原重型机器厂等单位对这个问题处理得好
    本报讯　太原重型机器厂、青岛四方机车车辆制造厂和北京第一机床厂，最近妥善解决了学徒工暂缓考工升级的问题，稳定了学徒工的学习情绪。
    这三个厂去年都招收了很多学徒工，当时各厂的领导人员曾按照第一机械工业部的规定，向学徒工宣布：要在一年之内把他们培养成三级技术工人。四方机车车辆制造厂还宣布：成绩优良经考工合格的，还可以提前出徒。因此，学徒工积极争取如期或提前出徒，有不少都人甚至连出徒后的生活开支计划也想好了。但是，今年3月，正当学徒工焦急地等待考工升级的时候，第一机械工业部又来指示说，由于今年国家的建设规模和速度有了调整，原有的工人已经有长余，学徒工今年暂时不出徒了。接到指示以后，有的厂不知道怎样向学徒工进行解释，怕解释不好会引起学徒工一致反对。于是，当学徒工询问为什么不按期考工升级的时候，就以“生产任务忙，没时间”等理由来推托应付。有的厂则把上级的指示简单地转抄在黑板报上，引起学徒工很大的不满。
    各厂的领导人员学习了毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的讲话以后，认识到这是人民内部的矛盾问题，必须把真实情况告诉大家。于是，便对徒工们说明：国家培养技术工人是根据生产需要，今年生产任务实际上用不了那么多的技术工人，如果硬把所有徒工都转为正式工人，国家就要多支出很多差额工资，学徒工应该以个人利益服从国家利益。各厂还向学徒工说明：在一年内要把一个根本不懂技术的人培养成为三级技术工人，事实上也不可能，去年上级作这个规定是比较主观的；同时，一个青年在学徒时期，应该集中精力掌握知识和技术，不应该斤斤计较待遇和级别。
    在进行说服教育的同时，各厂对学徒工提出的合理要求和困难，也作了妥善的处理。例如四方机车车辆制造厂同已转为运杂工的徒工签订协议书，将来需要增加生产工人时，优先吸收他们；对家庭生活确有困难的人，工会将给以适当救济。
    经过了这一番工作，绝大部分徒工对暂不升级考试都表示满意。他们说，既然国家有困难，为什么不早把真情实况告诉我们呢？如果早说了，我们也就早想通了。太原重型机器厂一个叫王耀堂的徒工说：“我开始考虑的是钱，没考虑能不能干。我的师傅还是三级工，他的技术可比我高得多了！”
