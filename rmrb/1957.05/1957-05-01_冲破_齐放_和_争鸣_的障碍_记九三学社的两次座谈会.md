Breaking Through the Obstacles of "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom" and "Letting a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend"
    -- A Record of Two Symposia Held by the Jiusan Society
    This reporter

    On April 27th and 29th, the Science, Education, and Culture Work Committee of the Central Committee and the Beijing Branch of the Jiusan Society convened two symposia with some of its members in Beijing to discuss how to further implement the policy of "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Letting a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend." Xu Deheng, Chairman of the Jiusan Society, hoped that the scholars and experts present would speak freely, discuss their personal understanding and experience of studying Chairman Mao's recent two speeches in light of the situation in their respective units, and boldly expose the various obstacles currently existing in the implementation of "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Letting a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend," so as to mobilize forces from all sides to break through them.

    Many of the well-known scholars and experts present believed that Chairman Mao's re-emphasis of the policies of "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Letting a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" and "Long-Term Coexistence, Mutual Supervision" at the Supreme State Conference has aroused widespread attention among intellectuals, cadres, and the masses both inside and outside the Party. Many people have already dared to stand up and boldly contend. However, there are still many obstacles in the implementation of these policies of the Party Central Committee, and the biggest obstacles come from dogmatism, sectarianism, and bureaucracy within the Party and leadership organs.

    Many speeches at the meeting focused on criticizing the dogmatism in higher education. Xue Yu, Director of the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association and Head of the Department of Pharmacy at Beijing Medical College, said that the blind application of Soviet experience in medical education over the past few years has hindered the further development of Chinese medicine. The medical courses that take six years to complete in the Soviet Union must be completed in five years in our country, so many basic science courses have only one year of study time in total. Students trained in this way have a poor foundation in theoretical science and can only work as technicians, making it impossible for them to engage in medical science research and push forward the development of medicine in our country. He had strong opinions about the lack of attention to the study of traditional Chinese medicine in pharmaceutical education. He said: Traditional Chinese medicine is unique to our country, but the health department only focuses on training pharmacy personnel and not on training chemical synthesis personnel, on the grounds that there is no such course in Soviet pharmaceutical education. In the research and creation of new drugs, there are many things in countries such as Britain, the United States, and West Germany that are worth learning from, but we have learned very little. He had raised these issues to Comrade He Cheng more than ten times during his tenure as Deputy Minister of Health, but they were not taken seriously, or even completely ignored.

    You Guoen, professor of the Chinese Department of Peking University, and others exposed the dogmatism in university curriculum reform and teaching work from the aspects of literature and language. Professor You Guoen said: It is right to teach "oral folk creation" first and then literary history in the literature departments of Soviet universities, which is in line with the situation in the Soviet Union. But in our country, it should not be like this, because ancient oral folk creation in our country already has written forms. However, the educational leadership department is unwilling to consider the opinions of experts and insists on mechanically applying Soviet experience, which makes our work very chaotic. Dogmatic habits are also very serious in the treatment of classical literary heritage. As long as the content of a teacher's lecture does not conform to the taste of dogmatists, they will issue unreasonable criticisms or even accusations. For example, I think that Han Fu was greatly influenced by Xun Qing. When I lectured on literary history, I lectured on Xun Qing and Han Fu together. Some people criticized this as formalism and went around to find out the situation, making the atmosphere very tense. It was not until someone wrote an article saying that Soviet literary history was also taught in this way that the dogmatists were silent.

    Many speakers also believed that the editorial departments of newspapers and publishing houses currently have quite serious dogmatism, which has a great impact on "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom" and "Letting a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend." Yuan Hanqing, Acting Director of the Scientific and Technological Information Institute, said that for a period of time he did not like to read "Study" magazine because the dogmatic habits were too heavy and he gained almost nothing from reading it. Li Zuyin, Counselor of the State Council, said that although there are good articles in "Political Science and Law Research" and "Political Science and Law Semi-Monthly," the dogmatism is also full, which is disgusting. You Guoen said: Many editorial departments ask people to write articles, not only "assigning the topic" but also "assigning the meaning"; sometimes even if the manuscript is written according to the "assigned meaning," the editorial department refuses to accept it for publication. Qi Gong, professor of Beijing Normal University, compared this practice of "assigning the topic" and "assigning the meaning" to holding a child's clay figure mold or ordering dishes to eat. The editorial department only wants things that fit the mold and taste.

    In terms of criticism of the sectarian style of the Ministry of Health, in addition to Xue Yu and others speaking at the meeting, Jin Baoshan, director of the Department of Public Health of Beijing Medical College, sent a written statement and attached a letter from a health worker. Xue Yu believed that the personnel arrangements of the Ministry of Health were not appropriate, and that the vast majority of directors and bureau chiefs were Party members. There were also problems with the use of welfare subsidies for organs. It was more difficult for non-Party members to apply for subsidies, while a Party member bureau chief received a subsidy of 600 yuan at a time. Xue Yu also talked about this matter at the meeting: Last September, Poland held a pharmaceutical conference and sent a letter inviting the Chinese pharmaceutical community to send representatives to participate. The Ministry of Health not only did not notify the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association of this matter, but also did not consult with the Pharmaceutical Association and sent three representatives, one of whom was not even a member of the Pharmaceutical Association.

    In his written statement, Jin Baoshan said that although the relationship between Party and non-Party members in health and medical institutions at all levels from the central to the local levels has improved significantly in recent years, there are still quite a few problems in terms of business, working methods, and even personnel arrangements between Party and non-Party members. He said: The country has been liberated for seven or eight years, and more intellectuals, professional workers, and scientific workers should participate in the leadership of practical work, which will inevitably make practical work better. The letter he attached was written by a health worker working in the frontier. The letter said: After graduating from the Department of Public Health of the university, he was assigned to work at a frontier epidemic prevention station. The superior asked him to engage in occupational health and equipped him with two epidemic prevention officers as assistants. But when the leadership announced the establishment of the occupational health section, the section chief was not him, but one of his assistants, because this person was a member of the Communist Youth League and he was a member of the masses. But in reality, the business work of the section was entirely done by him, even the summary plan was his responsibility.

    The scholars and experts present cited many facts to show that the bureaucracy and irresponsibility in higher education are also very serious. Wei Jianguo, professor of the Chinese Department of Peking University, said: Now we are running schools using the methods of running factories, rural areas, and the army. When a method is put forward, it must be implemented without discussion. Zhou Zumo, professor of the Chinese Department of Peking University, said: The Ministry of Higher Education once issued a Soviet teaching plan for reference. I asked the comrades of the Ministry of Higher Education what year it was, and they replied that they didn't know. He also criticized the school leaders for not going deep into their work and for lacking a unified plan and arrangement. Teachers were often notified temporarily to open new courses, and teachers had to burn the midnight oil to write lecture notes. He himself was like this. Since liberation, he has opened new courses every year. One year, he got arthritis from writing lecture notes in the winter night.

    At the symposium, scholars and experts also expressed their views on how to "let bloom" well and "contend" well. Jin Baoshan believes that in the field of medicine, there is still a lack of basic conditions for contention. Since liberation, the achievements in health care have been great and unprecedented; but there are very few creative inventions in medical science and experts who can stand on their own. Therefore, medical scientists should bury themselves in hard work and not rush to contend. Zhu Hongfu, Deputy Director of the Institute of Entomology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said that it is still the beginning of contention, with more discussion on policies and methods and less content of contention. If Lysenko and Morgan were born in China, there would be a big contention. He believes that contention should have content and should not be confined to a room. It should be proved correct through practice or experimentation. Li Jinxi, professor of Beijing Normal University, also believes that contention should not only be reasonable but also have substance. Therefore, scientists must strive to march toward science. Many people mentioned that the "five-sixths" problem has not been guaranteed and hope that relevant departments can solve it. This is one aspect. On the other hand, some people believe that whether contention can be carried out well in the future depends on the leadership of the Party. Ning Jiafeng said: If only non-Party members contend and Party members do not contend, it will not be able to contend. He hopes that Party members will dispel their worries and contend both internally and externally, from top to bottom!

    冲破“齐放”和“争鸣”的障碍
    ——记九三学社的两次座谈会
    本报记者
    4月27日和29日，九三学社中央和北京市分社的科学文教工作委员会，召集在京的部分社员举行了两次座谈会，讨论如何进一步贯彻“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针。九三学社主席许德珩，希望到会的学者专家们畅所欲言，结合自己所在单位的情况，谈谈个人学习毛主席最近两次讲话的心得和体会；同时大胆地揭露当前在贯彻“百花齐放，百家争鸣”上的种种障碍，以便动员各方面的力量来冲破它们。
    到会的许多位著名的学者专家认为，毛主席在最高国务会议上再一次提出“百花齐放，百家争鸣”、“长期共存、互相监督”的方针以后，已经引起了党内外知识分子、干部和群众的普遍重视，许多人已经敢于起来大胆地争鸣。但是，在贯彻执行党中央的这些方针上，仍然存在着许许多多的障碍，而其中最大的障碍是来自党内和领导机关的教条主义、宗派主义和官僚主义。
    会上的许多发言，集中地批评了高等教育工作中的教条主义。中国药学会理事长、北京医学院药学系主任薛愚说：由于几年来在医学教育中生搬硬套苏联的经验，妨害了中国医学的进一步发展。在苏联六年学完的医学课程，在我国五年就要学完，因而许多门基础科学课程统共只有一年的学习时间。这样培养出来的学生，由于理论科学的基础差，只能作技术员，不可能很好地从事医学科学的研究工作，把我国的医学向前推进一步。他对于药学教育中不重视中药的研究很有意见。他说：中药是我国特有的东西，可是卫生部门只重视培养配药人材，而不重视培养化学合成人材，理由是苏联的药学教育中没有这一门课。在新药的研究创制方面，英、美和西德等国有许多东西值得我们学习，但是我们却学习得很少。对于这些问题，在贺诚同志担任卫生部副部长的期间，他曾经十多次地提出意见，但是都没有受到重视，甚至根本置之不理。
    北京大学中文系教授游国恩等，从文学和语文等方面，揭露了大学课程改革和教学工作中的教条主义。游国恩教授说：在苏联的大学文学系里，先讲“人民口头创作”，再讲文学史是对的，符合苏联的情况。但是在我国就不应当这样，因为我国古代的人民口头创作已经有了文字的东西；可是教育领导部门却不愿意考虑专家的意见，硬要机械搬用苏联的经验，结果使得我们的工作很忙乱。在对待古典文学遗产方面，教条主义的习气也很严重。只要教师讲课的内容有一点不符合教条主义者的胃口，他们就发出无理的批评以至指责。例如，我认为汉赋受荀卿的影响很大，在讲文学史时，就把荀卿和汉赋一起讲，有人就批评这是形式主义，并且到处了解情况，弄得很紧张。直到有人写了一篇文章，说是苏联的文学史也是这样讲的，教条主义者才闭口无言。
    许多发言的人还认为：目前报刊和出版社的编辑部存在着相当严重的教条主义，这对于“齐放”和“争鸣”有很大的影响。科学情报研究所代所长袁翰青说：有一个时期他很不爱看学习杂志，因为教条主义习气太重，看了几无所得。国务院参事李祖荫说：“政法研究”和“政法半月刊”中，虽然不无好文章，但教条主义也表现得十足，令人生厌。游国恩说：许多编辑部请人写稿，不但“命题”，而且“命意”；有时甚至照着“命意”写出来的稿子，编辑部也不肯接受出版。北京师范大学教授启功把这种既“命题”又“命意”的作法，比作是拿着小孩扣泥人的模子，或者是叫菜吃饭，凡是合乎模子和口味的东西，编辑部才要。
    在对卫生部的宗派主义作风的批评方面，除了薛愚等人在会上作了发言以外，北京医学院公共卫生系主任金宝善送来了书面发言，并且附来了一个卫生工作人员给他的一封信。薛愚认为卫生部的人事安排不够妥当，司局长以上的绝大多数是党员。机关福利补助费的使用也有问题，不是党员请求补助费比较困难，而一个党员局长，一次就得到六百元的补助费。薛愚还在会上谈了这样一件事：去年9月，波兰举行药学代表大会，来信邀请我国药学界派代表参加。卫生部不但没有把此事通知中国药学会，而且不同药学会商量，就派出了三个代表，其中有一个人还不是药学会会员。
    金宝善在书面发言中表示，在从中央到地方的各级卫生医疗机构中，虽然几年来党与非党的关系有了显著的改进；但是党与非党在业务上、工作方法上以至人事安排上，都还有相当多的问题。他说：全国解放已经七、八年了，应当有更多的知识分子、专业工作者和科学工作者参与实际工作的领导，这样必然会把实际工作作得更好些。他附来的那封信，是一个在边疆工作的卫生工作者写的。信中说：他在大学的公共卫生系毕业以后，被分配到一个边疆防疫站工作，上级要他搞劳动卫生，给他配备了两个防疫员当助手。但是当领导上宣布成立劳动卫生股时，股长不是他，而是他的一个助手，因为这个人是团员，他是群众。可是实际上股里的业务工作完全由他来作，甚至连总结计划也是他的事。
    到会的学者专家们举出许多事实，说明高等教育工作中的官僚主义和无人负责的现象也是很严重的。北京大学中文系教授魏建功说：现在是用办工厂、农村和军队的办法来办学校，拿出一个办法来，就得贯彻，没有商量。北大中文系教授周祖谟说：高等教育部曾经发下来一个苏联教学计划供参考，我问高教部的同志是那一年的，他们答复说不知道。他还批评了学校领导人的工作作风不深入，工作缺乏统一的计划和安排，往往临时通知教师开新课，教师只好开夜车赶写讲义。他自己就是这样，从解放以后，年年开新课，有一年因为冬夜赶写讲义，得了关节炎。
    在座谈会上，学者专家们还对怎样才能放得好和鸣得好发表了意见。金宝善认为：在医学领域内，目前还缺乏争鸣的基本条件。解放以后，卫生事业上的成就是很大的，史无前例的；但是在医学科学的创造发明和能够独树一帜的专家是极少的。因此医学科学工作者应当埋头苦干，不必急于争鸣。中国科学院昆虫研究所副所长朱弘复说：现在还是鸣之初，谈方针方法多，鸣的内容较少。如果李森科和摩尔根生长在中国，就会有大鸣。他认为鸣要有内容，不能仅仅关在屋子里鸣，要通过实践或实验来证明鸣的正确。北京师范大学教授黎锦熙也认为，鸣不仅要言之成理，而且要言之有物。所以科学家们都要努力向科学进军。许多人都谈到“六分之五”的问题还是没有保证，希望有关部门能够加以解决。这是一方面。另一方面，也有人认为今后能不能鸣得好，关键在于党的领导。宁嘉风说：如果只有党外人士鸣，党员都不鸣，是鸣不起来的。他希望党员解除顾虑，内外上下都鸣起来！
