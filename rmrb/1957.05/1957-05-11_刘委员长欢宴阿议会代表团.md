Xinhua News Agency, 10th -- Chairman Liu Shaoqi held a banquet tonight to welcome the Albanian People's Republic People's Assembly Delegation.

    Chairman Liu Shaoqi said at the banquet: The industrious, brave, and intelligent Albanian people, under the leadership of the Albanian Labor Party, are united and have overcome foreign invaders with unwavering will, and have overcome various difficulties, transforming Albania from a backward agricultural country into a socialist industrial-agricultural country. We extend our warm congratulations to you, and through you, to the Albanian people with admiration and great joy. The various achievements of the Albanian people in socialist construction are an inseparable part of the entire achievements of the socialist camp. The Chinese people are very happy and gratified to have such a strong socialist country on the Adriatic coast.

    Chairman Liu Shaoqi said: We have already established extensive cooperation in political, economic, and cultural fields between our two countries. Recently, friendly exchanges between our two countries have become increasingly frequent. The common ideas of Marxism-Leninism, the great goal of building socialism and communism, and the just struggle to safeguard world peace closely link the people of China and Albania.

    Chairman Liu Shaoqi said: We sincerely welcome you to visit more places, see more things, and give us criticisms and corrections on the errors and shortcomings in our work at any time during your visits and contacts.

    The head of the delegation, Chairman of the Albanian People's Assembly, Marko, then spoke. He said: Your cordial hospitality and the many words of praise about our country you have spoken here reflect the love of the Chinese people for the Albanian people.

    Chairman Marko said that under the leadership of the heroic Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people are making great contributions to the world communist movement and safeguarding world peace and security. He said: We are extremely happy and proud of the achievements made by the Chinese people.

    Chairman Marko said that the friendship between Albania and China, along with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries—from the Pacific Ocean to the Adriatic Sea—is the most reliable guarantee of our bright future. No force can destroy the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, because this friendship is deeply rooted in the victorious ideology of Marxism-Leninism.

    Albanian Ambassador to China, Balili, and his wife were invited to attend the banquet.

    Also present at the banquet were Vice-Chairmen Li Jishen, Shen Junru, Peng Zhen, and Chen Shutong, Vice-Premier Li Xiannian, Secretary-General Xi Zhongxun, Vice-Chairmen of the National Committee of the CPPCC Zhang Bojun and Bao Erhan, Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs Ji Pengfei, members of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the Supreme People's Court, the Supreme People's Procuratorate, heads of various people's organizations and the Beijing Municipal People's Committee, and people from all walks of life who have visited Albania.
