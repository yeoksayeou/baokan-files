    The Advertising Tactics of Madison Avenue 　Feng Zhidan
    Anyone who has been to the United States probably knows about Madison Avenue in New York. This is the center of all the bizarre commercial advertising in the United States. Being in that red and green world of fantastic neon advertisements can be dizzying. American advertising designers use all sorts of strange and bizarre methods every day to carry out large-scale deception of consumers.
    Some skilled American diplomatic brokers, like Dulles and his ilk, are quite adept at the Madison Avenue tricks. They often use this set of advertising techniques in international diplomatic affairs. Mr. Richards, the special envoy of the U.S. President who recently visited the Middle East, naturally copied the deception of Madison Avenue. Starting from March 12, he spent nearly two months wandering around the Middle East, advertising the "Eisenhower Doctrine" everywhere, portraying this "Doctrine" as the United States wanting to "cooperate with Middle Eastern countries to safeguard their independence" and "help" Middle Eastern countries achieve "peace." Mr. Richards also peddled the doctrine door-to-door in various Middle Eastern countries, forcing his way in regardless of whether people wanted his goods or not. No wonder the "New York Herald Tribune" of April 25 also said: "Because people in the Middle East are not very familiar with the Madison Avenue approach, many people in these places are a bit confused by the strange sight of our new roving ambassador peddling the Eisenhower Doctrine like a new brand of soap powder"!
    However, the people of the Middle East are not "confused" about Mr. Richards' advertising tactics; they are very clear about what kind of stuff the "Eisenhower Doctrine" is. While Mr. Richards, the salesman, was advertising the "Eisenhower Doctrine" in the Middle East, the United States announced its participation in the military committee of the Baghdad Pact, announced "aid" to Israel, and sent oil tankers to invade the territorial waters of Arab countries - the Straits of Tiran and the Gulf of Aqaba. These actions by the United States, which have caused dissatisfaction and protests in almost all Arab countries, are enough to prove that Mr. Richards' advertising tactics cannot "confuse" the people of the Middle East.
    Especially in the recent Jordanian incident, Colonel Swinehart, the military attaché of the U.S. Embassy in Amman, and Admiral Brown, the commander of the U.S. Sixth Fleet, showed their prowess. These American "diplomats" never want to play the roundabout games of Madison Avenue; they are good at organizing subversion plots and flexing their muscles. Swinehart despicably planned the political crisis in Jordan, while Brown ordered his Sixth Fleet to sail to the eastern Mediterranean, pointing its guns at the Jordanian people and coercing Jordan to submit to the will of the United States. Even the American press believes that the American intervention in Jordan has surpassed the entire history of the "Pax Britannica," and is more than the "nineteenth century practice of often sending one or two warships flying the British flag to suppress" the national independence movements of various countries.
    Regarding the actual "content" of the "Eisenhower Doctrine," a dispatch from Washington by the United Press on May 11 has already made it clear enough. It said that the Sixth Fleet's intervention in Jordan was only the "first step" of the "Eisenhower Doctrine," and "what to do next"? The United Press stated: "It is generally believed that since the United States has taken the first step, it will involuntarily (?) assume all the obligations of the Middle East." These "obligations" are: "The United States will assume the military obligations that Britain and France have abandoned," "The American flag will fly on the Mediterranean, Red Sea, and Indian Ocean sea like the British flag," and the United States will "fill the power vacuum in the Middle East"….
    Former U.S. Senator Wheeler once said, "If necessary, I can prove with the help of advertising that viper meat tastes the best and patricide is the highest morality." Another well-known American figure, Warner, a celebrity in the American publishing industry, also said this: "Advertising must make people believe that roosters can lay eggs and chicks are hatched by white rabbits." Let's not discuss whether anyone in the United States really believes in advertisements like "patricide is the highest morality" and "roosters can lay eggs," because this is the "moral standard" of the American way of life. However, it can be said with certainty that this time Mr. Richards went to the Middle East, wanting to portray the "Eisenhower Doctrine" as an advertising trick for the "independence" and "peace" of Middle Eastern countries, but it was exposed by the aggressive actions of the United States in Jordan and the Middle East. In any case, it is impossible to imagine that the people of the Middle East would believe that Colonel Swinehart is their "friend," and that the Sixth Fleet's intervention in Jordan is to "safeguard" the "independence" and "peace" of the Middle Eastern countries!
    Therefore, even though this American salesman is very proficient in the advertising tactics of Madison Avenue, he is ultimately doomed to failure. One cannot say that Mr. Richards' activities in the Middle East to promote the "Eisenhower Doctrine" were not energetic, nor can one say that he was not cunning enough. He was clever enough. When he took the advertisement to the Middle East, he first went to Lebanon, which the United States praised as a "sensible country," and then to those member countries of the Baghdad Pact that had already been hooked. The target of Mr. Richards' promotion of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" was obviously not these "hooked fish." Even if Mr. Richards did not go to these countries, they would have been supporting the "Eisenhower Doctrine" long ago. Mr. Richards' attempt to go to these countries was to use the "welcome" of those countries to boost his own momentum and increase his own propaganda "capital." But the facts proved that this "capital" was minimal. Mr. Richards did not get any results in Afghanistan, Yemen, and Sudan. Although he had repeatedly shamelessly expressed his desire to obtain "invitations" from Egypt, Syria, and Jordan, the result could not but make him "disappointed." Finally, he even sat on the Ethiopian plateau, 3,000 meters above sea level, boredly watching the Middle Eastern situation, waiting for good luck to arrive. However, Mr. Richards did not have good luck, and the "invitations" he longed for never arrived. Just as he was in an embarrassing situation, the master of the White House hurriedly called him back.
    Now, Mr. Richards, the salesman of the "Eisenhower Doctrine," has returned to Washington. Although his advertising tactics have failed in the Middle East, he is now using his advertising tactics in Washington. However, in Washington, he is advertising his "meritorious promotion" and greatly bragging about his "achievements." As for his failure to go to Egypt, Syria, and Jordan, he did not say that it was because he was afraid of arousing the strong anti-American colonialist sentiments of the people of these countries; he only lightly told reporters that this was not because his advertising tactics were not good, but because he was recalled to Washington and "did not have time to prepare to visit these countries"….

    麦迪逊大街的广告术	　冯之丹
    到过美国的人，大概都知道纽约有条麦迪逊大街。这里是全美国光怪陆离的商业广告的中心。置身在那红红绿绿的奇幻的霓虹广告世界里，简直能使人头晕目眩。美国广告设计者的各式各样离奇怪诞的手法每天向消费者进行着大规模的欺骗。
    对于麦迪逊大街的那一套把戏，美国一些熟练的外交掮客们如杜勒斯之流是颇为拿手的。他们在国际外交事务中是经常耍弄这一套广告术的。不久以前访问中东地区的美国总统特使理查兹先生，自然也抄袭了麦迪逊大街的骗术。从3月12日起，他在中东逛了将近两个月，到处为“艾森豪威尔主义”大做广告，把这个“主义”说成是美国要“和中东各国合作来维护它们的独立”，“帮助”中东国家获得“和平”。理查兹先生并且在中东各国沿门兜售，不管别人要不要他的货色，硬闯上门去。难怪4月25日的“纽约先驱论坛报”也这么说：“由于在中东，人们不太了解麦迪逊大街的那套做法，这些地方的许多人对我们这位新任巡回大使像兜售一种新牌皂片那样兜售艾森豪威尔主义的奇特景象，都感到有点迷惑不解”了！
    然而，中东人民对于理查兹的广告术并不是“迷惑不解”的，他们很清楚“艾森豪威尔主义”究竟是什么样的货色。就在理查兹这个推销员在中东为“艾森豪威尔主义”大做广告的时候，美国宣布了参加巴格达条约集团的军事委员会，宣布了对以色列的“援助”，并且派遣油船侵犯了阿拉伯国家的领水——蒂朗海峡和亚喀巴湾。美国的这些行动，几乎引起了所有的阿拉伯国家的不满和抗议，就足以证明理查兹的广告术并不能使中东人民“迷惑不解”。
    特别是在这次约旦事件中，逞能的是美国驻安曼使馆的武官史维尼上校，是美国第六舰队司令布朗。这些美国的“外交官”从来不想耍弄麦迪逊大街的那一套转弯抹角的玩艺儿，他们擅长的是组织颠复阴谋和耀武扬威。史维尼卑鄙地策划了约旦的政治危机，而布朗则命令他的第六舰队驶向东地中海，把大炮对准了约旦人民，威迫约旦屈从美国的意旨。连美国报刊都认为，美国干涉约旦的活动超过了“不列颠统治下的和平”的全部历史，较之“十九世纪常常以派遣一两艘飘扬着英国国旗的战舰去镇压”各国民族独立运动的行径是有过之无不及的。
    关于“艾森豪威尔主义”的实际“内容”，合众社5月11日从华盛顿发出的电讯已经说得够露骨的了。它说第六舰队干涉约旦的事件仅仅是“艾森豪威尔主义”的“第一个步骤”，而“下一步怎么办”？合众社说道：“人们一致认为，美国既然已经走了第一步，它就会不自主（？）地承担中东的全部义务”。这些“义务”就是：“由美国承担英国和法国已经放弃了的军事义务”，“美国国旗像英国国旗那样在地中海、红海和印度洋海面上飘扬”，由美国“填补中东的实力真空”……。
    美国前参议员韦勒曾经说过，“如果需要，我可以在广告宣传的帮助下证明蝮蛇的肉味最美，杀父的行为是最高的道德。”另一个美国的知名之士，美国出版界的名流华纳也这样说：“广告宣传一定得使人们相信，雄鸡可以生蛋，小鸡是小白兔孵出来的”。我们姑且勿论在美国是不是有人真正相信“杀父的行为是最高的道德”和“雄鸡可以生蛋”之类的广告，因为这是美国生活方式的“道德标准”。但是，可以肯定地说，这次理查兹到中东，想把“艾森豪威尔主义”说成是为了中东国家“独立”与“和平”的广告骗术，却被美国在约旦和中东地区的侵略行径所揭穿了。无论如何也不能够设想，中东人民会相信史维尼上校是他们的“朋友”，第六舰队的干涉约旦是为了“维护”中东各国的“独立”与“和平”！
    因此，尽管美国的这位推销员十分精通麦迪逊大街的广告术，而最后仍然不能免于失败的命运。人们不能说理查兹在中东推销“艾森豪威尔主义”的活动是不卖力气的，也不能说他不够奸诈。他是够机灵的了。当他带了广告到中东的时候，首先到被美国誉为“懂事的国家”的黎巴嫩，然后又到那些早就上了钩的巴格达条约集团成员国去。理查兹推销“艾森豪威尔主义”的对象，显然不是这些“上钩的鱼儿”。理查兹即使不到这些国家去，它们早就在为“艾森豪威尔主义”捧场了。理查兹到这些国家去的企图，是想借那些国家的“欢迎”来壮壮自己的声势，增加自己的宣传“资本”。可是事实证明，这些“资本”是微乎其微的。理查兹在阿富汗、也门和苏丹没有得到任何结果。虽然他也曾几次三番地厚着脸皮表示要得到埃及、叙利亚和约旦的“请帖”，而结果也不能不使他“失望”。最后，他甚至坐在埃塞俄比亚拔海三千公尺的高原上无聊地观望中东风色，以待好运气的到来。然而理查兹并没有交到好运，他所渴望的“请帖”一直没有到手。正在他陷于狼狈尴尬处境的时候，白宫的主人便匆匆地把他召回去了。
    现在，“艾森豪威尔主义”的推销员理查兹回到了华盛顿。虽然他的广告术在中东已经失灵；但他到了华盛顿却又在施展他的广告术了。不过在华盛顿，他是为自己的“推销有功”而做广告，他为自己的“成就”大大吹嘘了一番。至于他未能到埃及、叙利亚和约旦去，他可不说是由于害怕激起这些国家人民反对美国殖民主义的强烈的情绪；他只是向新闻记者们轻轻地说，这不是由于他的广告术不好，而是因为他被召回华盛顿，“没有时间准备访问这些国家”了……。
