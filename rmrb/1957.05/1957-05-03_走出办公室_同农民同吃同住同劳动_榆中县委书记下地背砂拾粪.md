Leaving the Office: Sharing Food, Lodging, and Labor with Farmers
Yuzhong County Party Secretary Carries Sand and Collects Manure in the Fields

(Our dispatch) Fifty-one county and township cadres stationed at the Xianfeng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yuzhong County, Gansu Province, along with cooperative cadres – from the County Party Secretary and County Party Committee members to cooperative cadres who are relieved of production duties – have left their offices and moved to live with farmers in various production teams, sharing their food and labor. Currently, they have purchased 35 sand-carrying baskets, 10 manure-collecting forks, and 5 hoes and shovels. They have already carried over 1,700 baskets of sand, delivered manure to 75 mu of land, swept 1,300 baskets of dirt from the roads, and plowed and prepared 11 mu of land. Many cadres are learning production techniques by taking farmers as their teachers. At present, most of these cadres have learned production skills such as carrying sand, dumping sand, driving carts, hauling manure, plowing, and preparing land. Ming Xingcai, the County Party Secretary stationed in the cooperative, gets up before dawn every day and goes to the fields with the cooperative members to carry sand. Li Guosheng, the Party Branch Secretary of the cooperative (and a member of the County Party Committee), carries more than 130 baskets of sand a day (cooperative members receive ten work points for carrying sixty baskets). Now, these fifty-one cadres walk with manure baskets on their shoulders and manure-collecting forks in their hands. In the past, when meetings were held in the township, the courtyard would be full of bicycles. Now, these bicycles have been replaced by manure baskets and forks. A spirit of "competing in hardship, competing in thorough work, and competing in connecting with the masses" is taking shape here.

In the process of working with cooperative members, cadres have discovered many problems within the cooperative. Ming Xingcai, in participating in production, discovered eleven problems in two mornings and solved them with the cooperative members. The 17th and 18th production teams found that the cooperative members were not enthusiastic about carrying sand. After understanding that this was because the quota for carrying sand had not been confirmed, the cooperative members' enthusiasm immediately rose, and they put forward many reasonable suggestions for drought resistance and moisture conservation. In a few days, each cadre discovered three to five problems of varying sizes and helped the cooperative members solve them one by one.

The down-to-earth work style of the cadres going to the countryside greatly moved and educated some township and cooperative cadres who were unwilling to endure hardship and delve into their work. The original thirty-two cadres of Xianfeng Cooperative who were unwilling to engage in production also voluntarily took off their uniforms, put on farmers' clothes, and went to the fields to produce. One morning after a snowfall, Comrade Ming Xingcai and several cadres swept dirt on a 700-meter-long section of road. After being discovered by the cooperative members, one person told another, and soon forty or fifty cooperative members came with shovels and brooms. In just one and a half hours, more than 300 baskets of road dirt were swept. Under the influence of cadres participating in production, the labor attendance rate of the entire cooperative has increased from the original 60% to 90%, changing the original phenomenon of "not going to the fields until it is bright, and not producing until the team is complete."

The result of cadres sharing food, lodging, and labor with farmers has greatly changed the relationship between cadres and the masses. Now, cadres and the masses are as close as family members. Cooperative members are also very concerned about the cadres in the process of labor. Ding Renchang, a seventy-year-old cooperative member, said to cadres Bai Zhiyong and Ding Zhanjia: "You are people who use your brains, so walk slowly when carrying sand, and be careful not to tire yourselves out."

### 走出办公室  同农民同吃同住同劳动  榆中县委书记下地背砂拾粪

    走出办公室  同农民同吃同住同劳动
    榆中县委书记下地背砂拾粪
    本报讯  甘肃省榆中县三角城乡先锋农业生产合作社的五十一名县乡驻社干部和社的干部，上自县委书记、县委委员，下至社的脱产干部已经走出办公室，搬在各生产队和农民住在一起，同吃同劳动。目前他们已买回背砂背斗三十五个，拾粪杈子十把，镢头、铁锨五张，并已背砂一千七百多背斗，送粪七十五亩，扫道土一千三百背斗，翻槎整地十一亩。许多干部拜农民为师，学习生产技术。目前这些干部大都学会了背砂、倒砂、赶车、拉粪、翻槎、整地等生产知识。驻社县委书记明星才天不亮就起床，和社员一块下地背砂。社的党总支书记李国胜（县委委员）一天背砂一百三十多背斗（社员背六十背斗就记十分工）。现在这五十一名干部走路肩上都背着粪筐，拿着拾粪杈子。以往每当乡上开会时，院子里就停满了自行车，现在这些自行车都被粪筐和杈子代替了。“比艰苦、比工作深入、比联系群众”的风气正在这里形成。
    干部和社员同劳动的过程中，发现了社内存在着的许多问题。明星才参加生产中，两个早晨就发现了十一个问题并和社员研究解决了。十七、十八两个生产队，在背砂时发现社员情绪不高，经过了解原来是因为背砂的定额没有肯定下来，经解决后，社员情绪顿时高涨，并提出了许多抗旱保墒的合理化建议。在几天时间中，每个干部都发现了三、五个大小不同的问题，并帮助社员一一作了解决。
    下乡干部不畏艰苦的作风，大大感动和教育了当地有些不愿艰苦、深入工作的乡社干部。先锋社原来三十二名不愿从事生产的干部，也自动脱下制服，穿起农民衣服下地生产了。在一个雪后的早晨，明星才同志和几个干部，在长达七百公尺的一段马路上扫土，被社员发现后，一个传一个，一会儿拿锨带帚的社员就来了四五十人，仅一个半钟头时间，扫路土三百多背斗。在干部参加生产的影响下，全社劳动出勤率由原来60％提高到90％，改变了原来“天不大亮不去下地，班子不齐不生产”的现象。
    干部和农民同吃同住同劳动的结果，大大改变了干部跟群众的关系，现在干部群众亲如家人。在劳动过程中社员还很关切干部，七十岁的老社员丁仁昌向干部白质永、丁占甲同志说：“你们是费脑子的人，背上砂要慢慢走，小心累坏身体。”
