　　　　Don't Randomly Attach Labels
　　Recently, a deputy director of the Zhejiang Provincial Bureau of Culture, at a meeting of several hundred cadres in the provincial cultural bureau system, conveyed Chairman Mao's speech at the propaganda conference, publicly declaring that a comrade's speech at the literary and art symposium a few days ago was "poisonous weed." What did that comrade say? He merely criticized an amateur Party cadre for pretending to understand and using administrative orders in leading literary and artistic work. How could this speech suddenly be labeled as "poisonous weed"? Let's look at the deputy director's judgment: "Saying that an amateur cannot lead a professional means opposing the leadership of the Party. This kind of thinking is of course a poisonous weed, a boil."
　　We do not know the details of the comrade's speech that he criticized, nor the specific circumstances he listed. The issue of amateurs leading professionals can also be specifically analyzed and studied. However, everyone present was taken aback by this sudden judgment. If criticizing the leadership turns into "poisonous weed," who would be willing to speak boldly and criticize frankly? Not to mention those non-Party friends who are kindly helping us with rectification.

    不要随便插标签
    最近，浙江省文化局一位副局长，在省文化局系统几百个干部的大会上，传达毛主席在宣传会议上的讲话时，公然宣判前几天文艺界座谈会上某同志的发言是“毒草”。那个同志说了些什么呢？他只是批评了一个外行党员干部在领导文艺工作中不懂装懂和行政命令的作风。这个发言怎么一下子被插上“毒草”标签的呢？请看副局长的论断：“说外行不能领导内行就意味着反对党的领导。这种思想当然是毒草、是脓包。”
    他所批评的那位同志发言的详情、所列举的具体情况，我们都不得而知。外行领导内行的问题，也还可以具体分析研究。但是，所有在场的人，听了这个突如其来的判断，却都不免大吃一惊。如果一批评领导，就变成了“毒草”，那还会有谁愿意大胆说话、坦率批评？就更不用说党外那些好心地帮助我们整风的朋友们了。
