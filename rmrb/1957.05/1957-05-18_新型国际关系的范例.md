Having read the joint statement of the talks between the governments and parties of the Soviet Union and Mongolia, and looking back at the thirty-six years of friendly relations between the two countries, we see a clear example of genuinely equal and mutually beneficial relations between large and small countries in the world. This new type of relationship between countries can only be established on the basis of the principles of proletarian internationalism.

The friendship between the Soviet and Mongolian peoples was established in the most difficult days, forged in blood by the two peoples in their repeated struggles against the common enemy, the imperialist aggressors. At the beginning of the 20th century, under the oppression of foreign invaders and domestic feudal forces, Mongolia was in an extremely backward state, with poverty and hunger looming over the entire country. In order to get rid of this miserable backwardness, the Mongolian people, under the leadership of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, rose up and carried out a heroic struggle under the brilliant light of the October Revolution, and achieved victory. The victory of the Mongolian revolution was inseparable from the assistance and support of the Soviet people. The Mongolian revolutionary leader Choibalsan said: "At that time, the young Soviet Republic was in the difficult years of civil war, destruction, and famine, but it still extended a fraternal hand of assistance to the suffering Mongolian people." Similarly, the victory of the Mongolian People's Revolution was a strong support for the young Soviet Union. In the Second World War, the heroic Mongolian People's Army fought side by side with the Soviet Red Army, contributing to the victory of the anti-fascist war.

The joint statement of the two governments pointed out that the foundation of Soviet-Mongolian relations is the Leninist principle of proletarian internationalism, fraternal mutual assistance, and comprehensive cooperation. This fraternal friendship has stood the test of time. In 1921, the Soviet Union and Mongolia signed the first equal treaty in Moscow - the agreement on friendly relations between the two countries. Lenin pointed out: "Backward countries can, with the help of the proletariat of the most advanced countries, pass over the stage of capitalist development to the Soviet system, and after a certain stage of development, to communism." This theory is of inestimable significance for the revolution and socialist construction of the Mongolian people. For thirty-six years, under the light of Lenin's theory, the Mongolian people have traveled a road that other countries must go through for many centuries. With the direct assistance of the Soviet Union, the Mongolian people have carried out tremendous construction work, fundamentally changing their original backwardness. Animal husbandry, which is the economic foundation of Mongolia, has been greatly developed. By December last year, 22% of herding households across the country had joined livestock cooperatives, and they have begun to mechanize labor. In order to transform the past nomadic lifestyle into a settled one, the government of the Mongolian People's Republic is working hard to develop agriculture in order to establish a solid feed base. Before the revolution, there was no industry in the country. Now, the proportion of industrial production accounts for about half of the total output value of the national economy, and it has become the leading sector of the socialist component of the national economy.

Economic relations between the Soviet Union and Mongolia have been developing smoothly. The selfless and comprehensive assistance of the Soviet people plays an important role in the socialist construction of the Mongolian people. According to the joint statement issued by the two governments, in order to continue to help the Mongolian people move towards socialism, the Soviet Union has decided to further provide the Mongolian people with various technical and economic assistance, and will provide Mongolia with a preferential loan of 200 million rubles. This assistance is of great significance for the Mongolian people to complete the "Three-Year Plan" from 1958 to 1960.

During the talks, the Soviet and Mongolian sides reached a consensus on important issues in the current international situation. In the joint statement, the two governments emphasized the importance of disarmament and cessation of nuclear weapons tests. The two countries fully support the struggle of the people of the Middle East for national independence, and support the efforts of the German Democratic Republic, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to unify their motherlands. The government of the Mongolian People's Republic welcomes the restoration of normal diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Japan, and is willing to hold negotiations with Japan on the restoration of normal relations. The joint statement also pointed out that the legitimate right of the Mongolian People's Republic to become a member of the United Nations should not be ignored, and the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations should be restored. These propositions all demonstrate the sincere desire of the Soviet Union and Mongolia to jointly safeguard world peace.

Under the current international situation, strengthening the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is the primary task of the people of all socialist countries. Recently, the frequent exchanges and a series of talks between the government and party delegations of socialist countries have further strengthened the unity between socialist countries. This friendly meeting between the governments and parties of the Soviet Union and Mongolia has made new contributions to strengthening the unity of the entire socialist camp.

The Chinese people congratulate our two fraternal neighbors on the achievements made in the talks, and hope that the fraternal friendship between the peoples of the Soviet Union, Mongolia, and China, and the friendly unity of all countries in the socialist camp will continue to develop and be consolidated.

### 新型国际关系的范例

    新型国际关系的范例
    读了苏联和蒙古两国政府和党的会谈声明，再回顾三十六年来苏蒙两国之间的友谊关系，我们看到了世界上大国和小国之间存在着真正平等和互助关系的一个鲜明范例，这种新型的国与国之间的关系，只有在无产阶级国际主义原则的基础上才能建立起来。
    苏蒙两国人民的友谊，是在最困难的日子里建立起来的，是两国人民在反对共同敌人帝国主义侵略者的多次斗争中用鲜血结成的。二十世纪初期，在外国侵略者和国内封建势力的压迫下，蒙古处在极为落后的状态中，贫困、饥饿笼罩着整个蒙古。蒙古人民为了摆脱这种悲惨的落后状态，在十月革命的光辉照耀下，在蒙古人民革命党的领导下，奋起进行了英勇的斗争，并且取得了胜利。蒙古革命的胜利，是和苏联人民的援助和支持分不开的。蒙古人民的革命领袖乔巴山说过：“当时年轻的苏维埃共和国正处在国内战争、破坏和饥饿的艰苦年代，但仍向备受苦难的蒙古人民伸出了兄弟般的援助的手”。同样，蒙古人民革命胜利，对于年轻的苏维埃也是一个有力的支持。在第二次世界大战中，英勇的蒙古人民军队和苏联红军并肩作战，对于争取反法西斯战争的胜利作出了贡献。
    两国政府的联合声明指出，苏蒙两国关系的基础是列宁主义的无产阶级国际主义、兄弟互助和全面合作的原则。这种兄弟友谊，是经住了时间的考验的。1921年苏蒙两国在莫斯科签订了第一个平等条约——关于两国之间友好关系的协定。列宁曾指出：“落后的国家得到最先进的国家中无产阶级的帮助，便能够越过资本主义的发展阶段过渡到苏维埃制度，并经过一定的发展阶段过渡到共产主义。”这一理论，对于蒙古人民的革命和社会主义的建设具有难以估量的巨大意义。三十六年来，蒙古人民在列宁的理论的光芒照耀下，走过了别的国家必须经历许多世纪才能走完的道路。蒙古人民在苏联的直接帮助下，进行了巨大的建设工作，从根本上改变了原来的落后面貌。作为蒙古经济基础的畜牧业，已经有了很大的发展，到去年12月，全国22％的牧户加入了畜牧合作社，他们已经开始使劳动机械化。为了使过去的游牧方式转变为定牧方式，蒙古人民共和国政府努力发展农业，以便建立巩固的饲料基地。革命前，全国没有任何工业，现在，工业生产的比重，已经占国民经济总产值的一半左右，它已经变成了国民经济中社会主义成分的主导部门。
    苏蒙两国经济关系一直在顺利发展。苏联人民大公无私和全面的援助，在蒙古人民的社会主义建设中起着重要的作用。根据两国政府所发表的联合声明，苏联为了继续帮助蒙古人民向社会主义迈进，决定进一步给蒙古人民各种技术和经济援助，将给予蒙古两亿卢布的优惠贷款，这些援助对于蒙古人民完成从1958年到1960年的“三年计划”具有重要的意义。
    苏蒙双方在会谈中，对于目前国际局势的重要问题取得了一致的意见。两国政府在联合声明中，着重指出裁军和停止试验核子武器的重要性。两国完全支持中近东各国人民的民族独立而进行的斗争，支持德意志民主共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、越南民主共和国为祖国统一所作的努力。蒙古人民共和国政府欢迎苏日两国恢复正常的外交关系，并且愿意与日本就恢复正常关系举行谈判。联合声明中并且指出不应忽视蒙古人民共和国成为联合国会员的合法权利，应该恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法权利。这些主张都表明了苏蒙两国共同维护世界和平事业的真诚愿望。
    在目前国际形势下，加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，是社会主义各国人民的首要任务。最近期间，社会主义各国政府和党的代表团的频繁往来和一系列的会谈，已使社会主义国家之间的团结获得了进一步的加强，这次苏蒙两国政府和党的友好会谈，在加强整个社会主义阵营的团结方面又作出了新的贡献。
    中国人民对于我们的两个兄弟邻邦的会谈所取得的成就表示祝贺，愿苏蒙中三国人民的兄弟友谊和社会主义阵营各国的友好团结日益发展和巩固。
