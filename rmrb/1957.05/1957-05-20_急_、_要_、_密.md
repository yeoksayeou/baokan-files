    "Urgent," "Important," "Confidential"
        Zou Difan
    His cabinet is filled with "Urgent," "Important," "Confidential,"
    Shaking his head and sighing:
    "Oh, so many things can't do without you!"
    One hand approves "Agreed," "Submit," "Agreed,"
    The other hand holds the telephone receiver,
    Reflexively reciting: "Let's talk about it later, consider, consider."
    He also leaves one ear to listen to reports,
    The secretary sits beside him like a loudspeaker.
    And cadres fill the hallway outside his door,
    Waiting for the "Urgent," "Important," "Confidential" from his cabinet.
    What's not "Urgent" is pressed into "Top Urgent,"
    "Urgent documents" passed down become "Top Top Urgent,"
    Cross, cross, plus cross,
    A whip to the fast horse that is his pen.
    Even documents that aren't "Confidential" are buried in the safe,
    "Oh, this batch of cadres can't be trusted!"
    So many "Important matters" are waiting for him to handle,
    "Oh, these young cadres probably lack the ability!"
    At the criticism meeting, he laughs generously:
    "Ah yo, I don't have three heads and six arms, how can I manage it all?
    What, I am a bureaucrat?
    If so, then it's a hardworking bureaucracy,
    My work is a bit passive, reactive, overwhelming,
    Losing the watermelon, picking up sesame seeds."
    The masses can no longer suppress their anger:
    "Bureaucrat, stop performing your solo act,
    You are already 'being' but not 'moving,' 'responding' but not 'paying' attention,
    You treat public affairs as your private life,
    Closing the door and not letting us take the lead.
    You are digging out our eyes, breaking our arms,
    Not letting everyone contribute their strength to socialism!"

    “急”、“要”、“密”
        邹荻帆
    他的柜子里装满了“急”、“要”、“密”，
    摇头晃脑地嘘一口气：
    “哦，这么多事都离不开你！”
    一只手批着“同意”、“上报”、“同意”，
    一只手拿着电话筒，
    条件反射地念着：“再说吧，考虑，考虑。”
    还留一只耳朵听汇报，
    秘书坐在旁边像放话匣子。
    还有满楼干部候在房门外，
    等待着柜子里的“急”、“要”、“密”。
    不“急”的压得成“特急”，
    “急件”交下去“特特急”，
    十字、十字、加十字
    快马加鞭笔一只。
    不“密”的公文也埋在保险柜里，
    “噢，这一批干部怕靠不住！”
    好多“要件”都等他来处理，
    “噢，这些小干部怕没能力！”
    批评会上他落落大方发笑语：
    “啊哟，我不是三头六臂，教我怎么办得及。
    什么，我是官僚主义？
    要是嘛，也是辛辛苦苦的官僚主义，
    我的工作是有点被动、应付、招架不住，
    丢了西瓜，拣了芝麻米。”
    群众再也忍不下怒火：
    “官僚主义者，别演你的单口相声戏，
    你已经是‘被’而不‘动’‘应’而不‘付’，
    你把公事当做私生活，
    关门不让我们拿主意。
    你是在挖我们的眼睛，折我们的膀子，
    不让大家给社会主义出力气！”
