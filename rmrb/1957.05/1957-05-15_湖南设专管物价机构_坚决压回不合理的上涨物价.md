    Hunan Establishes Special Price Control Agency
    Resolutely Push Back Unreasonable Price Increases

    Since this spring, prices in various parts of Hunan have risen slightly. In Changsha City, an inspection of 88,000 kinds of commodities revealed that from January to March, over 5,400 had their prices adjusted, with 65% increasing and 35% decreasing. If calculated using the retail price index of 140 commodities across ten categories in the three cities of Changsha, Zhuzhou, and Hengyang, the average increase in March of this year compared to December of last year is 0.7%. Looking at the category index, grains, many industrial products, and daily necessities have remained stable, while tobacco, alcohol, and tea have even decreased by 0.4%.

    After the unified increase in prices of agricultural and sideline products such as pork and oils, it has greatly stimulated rural production. For example, the number of live pigs in rural Hunan has increased from 6 million at the end of last year to over 6.7 million, and agricultural and sideline production and diversified operations have become universally more active. Therefore, increasing these prices is reasonable.

    However, some production or business units, in their one-sided pursuit of profits, took the opportunity to unilaterally raise the prices of some commodities that should not have been raised, or the increases were excessive. Secondly, the free market prices lacked necessary management, leading to arbitrary price increases.

    What commodities have had unreasonable price increases? Mainly vegetables, non-staple foods, some handicrafts, and daily household sundries. For example, pork increased by 6.25% per catty compared to the original price, while cured meat increased by 21% compared to the original price, and lard increased by 35.14%. Another category is handicrafts. After the price adjustment of tung oil, each hundred umbrellas required only four yuan and five jiao more of tung oil as raw material, but the actual selling price increased by sixteen yuan and five jiao. The price increases of some household sundries are also unreasonable, such as children's cradles which increased by 13.28%, while cloth shoes increased by 9.68%. There are about two hundred kinds of commodities with such unreasonable increases.

    In order to implement the central government's policy of stabilizing prices and correctly implementing price policies, the Hunan Provincial People's Committee has decided to establish a special price control agency to comprehensively and uniformly manage price work, and has proposed five specific measures. The prices of some commodities that should not have been raised or have been raised excessively will be resolutely pushed back down. ·Luo Houren·

    湖南设专管物价机构
    坚决压回不合理的上涨物价
    今春以来，湖南各地物价稍有上升。长沙市检查八万八千多种商品中，从1月至3月有五千四百多种调整了价格，其中65％调高，35％调低。如以长沙、株洲、衡阳三个市十类共一百四十种商品的零售价格指数计算，则今年3月比去年12月平均要上升0.7％；从分类指数看，粮食，许多工业品和日用品一直稳定，烟、酒、茶类还下降了0.4％。
    猪肉、油脂类等农副产品，统一调高价格后，对刺激农村生产起了很大作用，如湖南农村生猪已由去年底的六百万头增加到六百七十多万头，农副业生产和多种经营普遍活跃起来了。因此调高这些价格是合理的。
    但是，某些生产或经营单位因为片面追求利润，乘机把一些不应该提价的商品也擅自提了价，或者是上升的幅度过大。其次是自由市场物价缺乏必要管理，随意抬价。
    提价不合理的是些什么商品呢？主要是蔬菜、副食品、部分手工业品和日常家庭杂用品。如猪肉每斤比原来价格提高6.25％，而腊肉却比原价提高21％，猪油提高了35.14％。另一类是手工业品，如桐油调价后，以桐油作原料的雨伞，每百把雨伞需要的桐油只提高四元五角，而实际售价却提高了十六元五角。有些家用杂品价格上涨也不合理，如小孩睡的摇篮涨了13.28％，布鞋却提了9.68％。像这样不合理上涨的商品，大约在二百种左右。
    为了贯彻中央稳定物价的方针和正确执行价格政策，湖南省人民委员会决定设立专管物价的机构，把物价工作全面统一管理起来，并提出了五项具体措施。对一些不应调高或调高幅度偏大的商品价格，将坚决压回。　·罗厚仁·
