    Train Announcer
    Liu Qian
    People can only hear your kind voice, and never ask about your appearance. You, the eyes of the train, beloved announcer, even poets easily forget you. The train travels towards plains and scattered cities, through steep cliffs and deep tunnels. The announcer, whether day or night, is a reliable clock for thousands of passengers. When we are on a long journey of thousands of miles, or eagerly anticipating the arrival of loved ones, the announcer seems to comfort us: "Be patient! It's only a few minutes, just relax!" She organizes current events and songs from all directions; she also tells us about famous scenic spots and historical sites so wonderfully; telling the stories of the heroes of Lüliang, Taihang Mountain, and Niangzi Pass... Twilight quietly slips past outside the train, the carriage is filled with laughter. She tells children to pay attention to hygiene and develop good habits. She helps you find relatives, taking care of you so thoughtfully when getting on and off the train. In the middle of the night, the announcer has to reluctantly wake you up, she whispers, "It's time, comrade, you should get off the train!" Regardless of whether the train is melted by the scorching heat under the blazing sun; no matter how the severe cold outside the window carries snowflakes flying; familiar with newly built cities and farms, familiar with newly built bridges; accustomed to hearing the croaking of frogs at midnight countless times, accustomed to the howling of the north wind. During the day, she accurately calculates the time for us; at night, she examines the mountains, terrain, and reports to us. The train announcer is a good friend on the journey. She works hard, how can we forget them!

    列车广播员
    柳倩人们只能听见你亲切的声音，从来不曾问起过你的面貌，你，列车的眼睛，敬爱的广播员，诗人笔下也容易将你忘掉。列车驶向平原和分散的城市，穿过嶮峻的山崖和幽深的隧道，广播员不论在白天或晚上，她是千万旅客们可靠的钟表。当我们疾行万里的征途，或是切盼到达的地方亲人来到，广播员好像安慰我们说：忍耐些吧！不过才几点几刻，你要稍安勿躁！她从四面八方组织来时事和歌唱；还为我们讲说名胜古迹讲得那么美妙；讲吕梁英雄，讲太行山，娘子关的故事……黄昏从列车外悄悄溜过，车厢里充满欢笑。她告诉孩子们爱卫生，要养成良好习惯，她替你找寻亲人，上车下车照应那么周到。半夜广播员不能不忍心惊醒你，她小声说：“是时候哪，同志，你该下车了！”不管列车在暴日下被盛暑包熔；不论窗外的严寒挟着雪花飞飘；熟悉新建的城市、农庄，熟悉新修的大桥；听惯多少次午夜蛙鸣，听惯北风的吹啸。白天她准确的替我们计算着时刻；黑夜她审识山峦、地形，给我们报道。列车的广播员是旅途中的好朋友，她辛勤的劳动，我们又怎能将她们忘掉！
