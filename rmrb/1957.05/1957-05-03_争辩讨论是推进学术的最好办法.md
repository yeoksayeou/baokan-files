Implementing the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom can advance scholarship. Experience proves that truth develops: it often progresses from vague to clear, from not quite correct to completely correct. The process of "arriving" is a process of development, which must include debate and discussion. Otherwise, one must admit that truth does not develop, but that the first discovery is equal to the final confirmation. The first discovery being equal to the final confirmation is not common. Even if it were common, enrichment, refinement, concretion, and making it convincing still require debate and discussion. Only debate and discussion are the best ways to clarify the truth and advance scholarship. Secondly, implementing the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom can strengthen unity. It is very difficult to make people believe in some principles without allowing them to speak. Even if people believe, they often agree outwardly but disagree inwardly, complying in public but opposing in private. Compliant in public but opposing in private is most detrimental to unity. Letting people speak and going through debate and discussion inevitably leads to victory and defeat. Those who are defeated may be unconvinced in their hearts but agree verbally, outwardly opposing but inwardly complying. However, outward opposition and inward compliance are not far from unity. Furthermore, implementing the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom can consolidate confidence in Marxism. Everyone is often afraid that Marxism will be adversely affected in the debate. In fact, Marxism itself stood up in debate; especially in China, it simply stood up under the high pressure of reactionary rule. If it can stand up under high pressure, how can it fall down in the free atmosphere of letting a hundred flowers bloom? Finally, implementing the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom can greatly invigorate the cultural, educational, and academic circles. This point has epoch-making importance.

However, implementing this policy also requires some effort. We are used to feudal life, and the atmosphere of debate has never been very strong. Even in advanced capitalist countries, such as Britain, the habit of free debate and discussion has only been cultivated within the small circle of the bourgeoisie for more than two hundred years. We want to surpass capitalism, so that the atmosphere of free debate and discussion permeates the whole country, rather than being limited to a small circle of a certain class, so that the spirit of loving the truth is active everywhere in all aspects. This is not an easy task. What to do? The leadership should call for more action and properly handle certain specific issues in the past. This is a powerful method. People in the cultural, educational, and academic circles should take action themselves, establish confidence, and break down concerns. This is a powerful method. People who preside over the editing and reviewing of newspapers, magazines, and books should take some measures, which is an even more powerful method. What measures should be taken? First, when you see an article with a judgmental title, such as criticizing someone's idealism, criticizing someone's metaphysical viewpoint, criticizing someone's bourgeois theory, etc., it is best to ask the original author to revise it. Because the reasoning has not been explained, and the ink lawsuit has not been fought, the main text of the judgment has come out, which will naturally prevent people from fighting the ink lawsuit. As for the added words in the article, you can ask the original author to reduce them. For example, the reasoning has been explained, and everyone can understand it; but to add some words after the clear reasoning: This is simply a reactionary bourgeois ideology, and so on. Such added words do not increase the persuasiveness of the reasoning, but only make people disgusted. Second, do not welcome idealism; welcoming idealism will prevent the debate from unfolding. If I run a newspaper and write an editorial on the first day saying that we also welcome idealism. I think this is very ineffective. Because readers are easily misunderstood by this, thinking that the people in the newspaper are self-proclaimed standard materialists, so they also welcome idealism. Otherwise, it is still difficult to avoid having idealistic places, so why welcome idealism to the outside? Moreover, the meaning of welcome is also extremely vague. Welcome idealists to expose their thoughts and then encircle and suppress them? Then none of the idealists will come. Welcome idealism itself to prevail in society, which violates your own wishes. Therefore, I suggest not to welcome idealism. If you don't welcome idealism, what do you welcome? The answer is to welcome the raising of questions, debate and discussion, and hope to obtain the truth. Third, seeing that adjectives such as "idealistic" and "materialistic" are used too much in articles. Truth cannot be piled up by adjectives, but is the result of thorough reasoning. If the reasoning is thorough, even without adjectives such as "dialectical materialism" or "Marxist," it may be completely in line with Marxism. So I often think that if you have to use adjectives, it is best to reduce some or change them slightly. For example, I want to change the three words "idealistic" to the three words "wrong." Because what is idealistic is certainly wrong, but what is wrong is not necessarily idealistic. It is quite difficult to be an editor, and there is no uniform method to promote letting a hundred flowers bloom. What I have said does not require much capital and it does not hurt to try.

    争辩讨论是推进学术的最好办法
    周谷城
    贯彻百家争鸣的方针，可以推进学术。经验证明，真理是发展的：常从模糊到清楚，从不甚正确到十分正确。“到”的过程，即是发展过程，必包括争辩讨论。否则便须承认真理不是发展的，而是第一次发见就等于最后的确定。第一次发见就等于最后的确定，这究竟不多。就算多吧，而充实、丰富、具体化、使人信服，仍须争辩讨论。唯有争辩讨论，是阐明真理、推进学术的最好办法。其次贯彻百家争鸣的方针，可以加强团结。一些道理，不让人讲，而要人信，是很不容易的。人们就是信了，常常口服心不服，阳奉阴违。阳奉阴违，最不利于团结。让人讲了，经过争辩讨论，免不了有个胜败。败了的可能心服口不服，阳违阴奉。然而阳违阴奉，离团结却不远了。再其次贯彻百家争鸣的方针，可以巩固对马克思主义的信心。大家常怕马克思主义在争鸣中受到不利的影响。其实马克思主义自身就是在争鸣中站起来的；在中国尤其特别，简直是在反动统治高压之下站起来的。在高压之下且能站起来，难道在百家争鸣的自由气氛中，反而会倒下去吗？最后，贯彻百家争鸣的方针，可以使文化、教育、学术界大大活跃起来。这一点有划时代的重要性。
    但贯彻这一方针，也要花些气力。我们过惯了封建生活，争鸣的气氛向来不甚浓厚。就是在资本主义先进国，例如英国，自由争辩讨论的习惯，单是在资产阶级的那个小圈子里，也经过两百余年的培养。我们要越过资本主义，使自由争辩讨论的气氛弥漫于全国，而不是限于某一个阶级的小圈子里，使各方面热爱真理的精神到处活跃，这颇不是一件容易的事。怎么办呢？领导方面多多号召，并把过去某些具体问题妥善处理，这是有力的办法；文化、教育、学术界人士自己动起来，树立信心，打破顾虑，这是有力的办法；主持报章、杂志、书籍编审的人采取一些措施，更是有力的办法。采取哪些措施呢？第一，看见文章上装了一个判决式的题目，如批判某人的唯心思想，批判某人的形而上学观点，批判某人的资产阶级理论，等等，最好送请原作者改一改。因为道理还没有讲，笔墨官司还没有打，判决书的主文就出来了，这自然会阻止人家打笔墨官司。至于文章中的加添语，可以请原作者减少些。例如道理已经讲明了，人人都看得懂；而要在已明之理的后面加添些话曰：这简直是反动的资产阶级思想，等等。这样的加添语，并不增加道理的说服力，而只令人生厌。第二，不要欢迎唯心主义；欢迎唯心主义，反使争鸣展不开。假如我办一种报纸，第一天作一篇社论曰，我们也欢迎唯心主义。我想这是很无效的。因为读者对此容易误解，认为报馆里的人自封为标准的唯物主义者，所以也欢迎唯心主义。否则自己还难免有唯心的地方，为什么要向外欢迎唯心主义呢？而且欢迎之义也极不明确。欢迎唯心主义者暴露思想然后加以围剿？则唯心主义者一个都不会来。欢迎唯心主义本身在社会上流行，则又违反了自己的愿望。因此我建议不要欢迎唯心主义。不欢迎唯心主义，欢迎什么呢？曰，欢迎提出问题，加以争辩讨论，希望获得真理。第三，见到文章中的形容词如“唯心的”、“唯物的”等等用得太多了。真理不是形容词所能堆砌成的，而是说理透彻的结果。道理说得透彻，虽无“辩证唯物主义的”、“马克思主义的”等等形容词，亦可能完全合乎马克思主义。所以我常想，万一要用形容词，最好减少一些或稍稍变动一下。例如“唯心的”三字我便想改用“错误的”三字。因为唯心的固然一定是错误的，但错误的不一定是唯心的也。当编辑颇为难，推动百家争鸣，方法也不一律，我所讲的，并不需花多少本钱，无妨试试。
