    Leading Comrades Serve Concurrently as Propagandists
    Hungarian Party Leaders Maintain Close Ties with the Masses

    The working style of Hungarian leading comrades in going deep into the lives of the masses has brought about new changes in the relationship between leaders and the masses. Now, Hungarian leading comrades all concurrently serve as Party workers – propagandists. Within half a year, they have each given several reports to the masses. For example, State Minister Marosan has given more than forty public speeches throughout the country, and each time he has been warmly welcomed by the masses. On "May Day," Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government Premier Kadar, State Minister Marosan, Foreign Minister Horvath, and other comrades led the parade into the square. A few days ago, State Minister Marosan took a walk alone to the front of the Chinese Embassy and even had a conversation with the guard. On "May Day," Foreign Minister Horvath and the staff of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, after the meeting, took an open cargo truck together to a restaurant for a get-together.

    领导同志兼任宣传员
    匈牙利党的负责人密切联系群众
    匈牙利的领导同志深入群众生活的作风，使领导和群众之间的关系起了新的变化。现在匈牙利的领导同志都兼任党的工作——宣传员，他们在半年内都已分别给群众作了几次报告。如国务部长马罗山同志在全国作过四十多次公开讲演，而且每次都得到群众的热烈欢迎。“五一”节那天，匈牙利工农革命政府总理卡达尔、国务部长马罗山、外交部长霍瓦特等同志都带领游行队伍进入广场。前几天国务部长马罗山独自散步到中国大使馆的门前，和守卫的警察还交谈了一次。在“五一”节的那天，外交部长霍瓦特和外交部的工作人员在散会后，一同坐上敞篷的载货卡车到一家餐厅去联欢。
