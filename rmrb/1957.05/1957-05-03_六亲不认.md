    "Disowning One's Relatives"
    Zang Kejia

    Longtime friends who haven't seen each other for a while, upon meeting again, it's hard to tell if they're happy or complaining. They always offer a meaningful smile, followed by the saying:
    "You've really become someone who 'disowns their relatives'."

    Close friends of many years, besides occasionally exchanging greetings from afar at meetings, it's common not to see each other for years. Living in the same city, yet "never visiting each other until death," and being "worlds apart" is no exaggeration.

    Why have friends become like the stars "Shen" and "Shang," never appearing together? Is it because, under the dark and reactionary rule of the past, everyone "helped each other in difficulty," and friends easily gathered together to open their hearts and express their feelings freely? Is it that today's situation is so different that this is no longer needed? I don't think so. Everyone feels that something is lacking in their lives, like flowers lacking dew. Life is tense, and also dry. After work, during illness, on beautiful spring days, in the wind and rain, how much we need a close friend to talk to our hearts' content. To talk about personal feelings, to talk about work plans, to talk about the past and the future... But, friends are in the heart, not in front of the eyes.

    "Work is too busy, there's no time, and no such leisurely mood." Yes, we are busy enough. Busy with work, busy with meetings, busy listening to reports, busy making self-criticisms... Truly everyone is busy to the point of being "delighted" in it. However, busyness is not the only wall that can keep friends apart for a long time.

    I feel that the flowers of friendship mostly fail to bloom due to the climate.

    In the old society, we talked about "personal relationships," while in the new society, we talk about "comrade relationships." Originally, "comrade" should include affectionate feelings, but in reality, it is not entirely so, or even not at all. It's as if "comrade relationship" is just a cold working relationship, while only friends can open their hearts to each other and pour out their enthusiasm. Therefore, some people who receive letters from friends, seeing only their name at the top with two dots below, or terms of brotherhood, feel warmth and secretly rejoice. If they are addressed as "comrade," they feel it's too generic, and a wave of coldness washes over them.

    In the early days of national liberation, most intellectuals still sought out relatives and friends, enthusiastically and sincerely interacting, pouring out their innermost thoughts to their friends. There were complaints of individualism; there was liberalism; maybe even reactionary thoughts. At that time, everyone loved to speak, loved to express themselves nakedly. In some movements over the past few years, this kind of "heart-to-heart talk" between friends ended up in "materials," or even led to grasping at shadows and relentlessly pursuing the "hidden meanings" within. As a result, many intellectuals "only speak three-tenths of what they know" to others. Just after the "Suppression of Counter-revolutionaries Movement," I heard many people say in unison, "From now on, except for necessary contact on working relationships, we will sever all contact!" These words were very resolute, but also very painful!

    Humans are emotional animals. What is life without friendship, like falling into a big hole? Some say, "Party members don't talk about emotions." Party members should abide by Party principles and not be swayed by personal feelings, but can "Party spirit" become something that clashes with "emotions"? Those who say this are, of course, somewhat biased in generalizing from a few, but it is also an undeniable fact: some Party members are as cold as ice, respectable but not lovable. Using such an attitude to make friends with non-Party members is like using an ice pop to try and elicit enthusiasm.

    Now the situation has changed. Although it is "suddenly warm, then cold again," spring is ultimately arriving in our hearts. "Letting a hundred flowers bloom" should not only be on paper, but also on our lips. Even if we release complaints, release liberalism, it's better than being confined in our hearts. The thawing spring breeze has arrived, let the flowers of friendship bloom.

### “六亲不认”

    “六亲不认”
    臧克家
    要好的朋友许久会不到面，乍见之下，不知是高兴还是抱怨，总是意味深长地微笑一下，跟着是这么一句：
    “真是‘六亲不认’了”。
    多年相交的知心朋友，除了偶尔在会场上远远地打个招呼，经年不见是常事。共同住在一个城市里，而“老死不相往来”，“咫尺天涯”，语不虚妄。
    为什么朋友成了“参”“商”？是不是在过去黑暗反动的统治下，大家“相濡以沫”，朋友之间，容易聚在一起披肝沥胆，慷慨抒怀，而今天情势已经大不同，就不需要这样了呢？我看不是的。人人觉得生活里缺乏一种东西，好似花儿缺乏露水。生活得紧张，也生活得干燥。在工作之余，在病痛之中，在春秋佳日，在风晨雨夕，多么需要有个知心朋友来开怀畅谈呵。谈一谈个人的情怀，谈一谈工作计划，谈一谈过去和未来……。可是，朋友在心上，不在眼前。
    “工作太忙了，没有时间，也没有那种闲情逸致了”。是，忙是够忙的了。工作忙，开会忙，听报告忙，作检讨忙……真是人人忙得个“不亦乐乎”。可是，忙不是惟一的墙可以把朋友长久地隔开。
    我觉得，友谊的花朵，多半是由于气候的关系，开不出来。
    在旧社会里讲“交情”，在新社会里讲“同志关系”。本来“同志”就应当包括相亲相爱的情谊，但是实际上却并不完全如此，甚或完全不如此。好似“同志关系”只是冷冰冰的工作关系，而朋友才可以彼此揭开心胸，倾泄热情。所以有人接到朋友的信，看到上款只写自己的名字下边缀上两点或称兄道弟，便认为亲切而心中暗喜，如果被称为“同志”，便觉得一般化，一阵冷淡感觉掠过心头。
    在全国解放初期，一般知识分子，还是寻亲问友，热情率真地相互交谈，把心底事倾倒在朋友面前。这里边有个人主义的牢骚；有自由主义；说不定还有反动思想。那时候，大家爱说，爱赤裸裸地表现自己。几年来在一些运动里，友朋间的这种“倾谈”有的上了“材料”，甚或望风捕影，穷追其中的“微言大意”。于是，许多知识分子“逢人只说三分话”了。在“肃反运动”刚过去时，我听到许许多多人异口同声地说“今后除了工作关系上的必要接触，断绝一切往还！”这话说得很决绝，但也很沉痛！
    人是感情动物，生活里除去友情，不像陷了个大窟窿？有人说：“党员是不讲感情的。”党员办事应该遵守党的原则，不徇私情，但是“党性”可能成为和“感情”牴牾的一种东西吗？说这话的人，当然是未免以少数概括全体的偏颇，这可也是不容否认的事实：有些党员冷若冰霜，可敬而不可爱。用这样态度去向党外交朋友，等于要用冰棒去敲出热情。
    现在的情况变了。虽然是“乍暖还寒”，但春意毕竟是来在了心上。“百花”不仅要放在纸面上，也要放在口头上。即使放出牢骚，放出自由主义，总比禁锢在心头好些。解冻的春风吹来了，友谊的花朵，开放吧。
