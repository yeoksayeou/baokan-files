Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, 28th. Hong Kong newspapers continued to comment on the anti-American demonstrations by the people of Taiwan on the 27th and 28th.

　　The "Hong Kong Commercial Daily" commented on the 27th, saying, "Liu Ziran died in vain, and we don't hear the Taipei authorities protesting the shooting of their own officials." On the contrary, Washington is launching an inquisitorial force against the Taipei authorities, aggressively pressing them. The commentary said, "Chinese people have Chinese personality, and the condescending attitude of the Washington authorities is intolerable and unacceptable to the compatriots in Taiwan!"

　　"Inside Story Observation Post" said on the same day that the American military "acquitted the murderer, but the Chinese masses who protested and demonstrated are guilty." The newspaper accused "the United States of using force to pressure the victim to apologize to it" as "exposing its ugliness to the world."

　　The "Hong Kong Commercial Daily" published another commentary on the 28th analyzing the reasons for such strong anti-American sentiment in Taiwan under the rule of the Kuomintang, saying that "the Chinese compatriots in Taiwan have obviously had enough of the pain of living under someone else's roof." The commentary pointed out that more and more people inside Taiwan are responding to the peaceful liberation of Taiwan, "because only this path can free Taiwan from American control and save the compatriots in Taiwan from American bullying."

    台湾当局不敢提出抗议　美国政府大兴问罪之师
    港报纸继续评论台湾反美事件
    新华社香港28日电　香港报纸27、28两日继续评论台湾人民反美示威事件。
      “香港商报”27日评论说：“刘自然白白地死了，我们听不到台北当局为他们自己的官员被枪杀而发出抗议”，反而是华盛顿向台北当局大兴问罪之师，咄咄逼人。评论说，“中国人有中国人的人格，华盛顿当局的颐指气使，台湾同胞无论如何不可忍受，也不能忍受！”
      “内幕观察报”同一天说，美军“杀人者判无罪，而中国群众抗议示威者却有罪”。这家报纸指责“美国用强力压迫被害者向他道歉”为“暴露其丑态于世界之前。”
      “香港商报”28日再次发表评论分析在国民党统治下的台湾有如此强烈的反美情绪的原因，是“台湾的中国同胞显然已经受够了寄人篱下的痛苦滋味”。评论指出，台湾内部很多人对和平解放台湾发生了越来越多的响应，“因为只有这条路才可能使台湾脱离美国人的控制，才可能使台湾同胞免于美国人的欺凌”。
