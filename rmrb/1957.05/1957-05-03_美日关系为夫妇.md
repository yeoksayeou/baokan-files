    "U.S.-Japan Relationship as Husband and Wife"
    Liu Zhongping
    After the war, a book appeared in Japan called "Japan's Chastity." This was a blood-and-tear-stained diary of Japanese girls who had lost their virginity to American soldiers. The violation of "Japan's Chastity" once became a symbol of occupied Japan.
    After the signing of the one-sided Treaty of San Francisco, it is said that the United States believed Japan was no longer occupied. Although U.S. military bases were still scattered throughout Japan, and American soldiers still strutted under the cherry trees, their name had changed from "occupation forces" to "garrison troops." Naturally, the symbolic way of describing U.S.-Japan relations should also change accordingly. What should it change to? MacArthur II, the newly appointed U.S. Ambassador to Japan, had a good analogy, saying that "the U.S.-Japan relationship is like husband and wife"!
    From being violated to being married, this must be seen as an improvement in status. But it seems this "marriage" is not consensual; it's more like the Yellow Robe Monster forcibly marrying Baihua Xiu in "Journey to the West," with a strong sense of "bullying and occupation." Not to mention the increasingly loud calls from the Japanese people to revise the unequal U.S.-Japan treaty and for "American devils to go home," even the Japanese conservative government recently said it wanted to "adjust U.S.-Japan relations," didn't it?
    Originally, in a society like the United States, if you were to lift the curtain on the husband-wife relationship, you would see that the man is the private owner, and the woman is merely the man's property. And this "husband" who came uninvited from the other side of the Pacific seems to have learned the spirit of the "husband's rights" of the ancient Japanese samurai, in addition to being a private owner. That is: the husband can arbitrarily beat and scold his wife, control her property, and interfere with her freedom; while the wife can only be respectful and dutiful, serving him diligently, but has no right to question her husband's actions.
    Interfering in internal affairs, demanding constitutional revisions, questioning military spending, delineating bases, restricting trade, etc., the United States takes whatever it wants from Japan, demanding obedience in everything. But when Japan asks the United States to open its domestic market to it and cooperate with its reparations plan for Southeast Asia to carry out Asian economic activities, the U.S. response is: American economic policy does not need to be directed by others. This is a good example of the "U.S.-Japan relationship as husband and wife."
    As for the U.S. military in Japan, using the superiority of the conqueror to oppress everything, treating the Japanese as worthless, and arbitrarily humiliating and injuring them, there is even more to say. In the incident of the U.S. military killing a Japanese farmer's wife in Sōmagahara, the U.S. authorities still refuse to hand the murderer over to the Japanese judicial authorities for processing. There are too many such things to list, here are a few randomly selected news items:
    △ On the evening of February 26, U.S. soldiers Rice and Walsh from the Itazuke base beat up Yuriko Hayashi, a waitress at the Kagetsu Hotel in Fukuoka City. On the same evening, Rice also beat up a worker, Kunihiro Akita, who died the next day from a fractured skull.
    △ In Hokkaido, U.S. military police from the U.S. military camp outside Sapporo, without a search warrant issued by the garrison commander, broke into the collective dormitory of female servants inside the camp twice in a row on February 27 and 28, searching each room and confiscating items.
    Japanese women working in U.S. military stores accused the U.S. military authorities of conducting intrusive and brutal body searches against them, violating their human rights. They specifically accused these searches of being conducted by forcibly stripping them naked and in very cold weather. The Japanese Ministry of Justice believes that such searches violate Japanese law, but a spokesman for the U.S. military authorities described these insulting body searches as "routine," saying that according to the U.S.-Japan "Administrative Agreement," Japanese women working in U.S. military institutions are subject to U.S. military regulations. This can also be considered a good example of the "U.S.-Japan relationship as husband and wife." From the perspective of "private ownership" and "husband's rights," isn't beating and scolding one's wife a very common thing?
    Naturally, since the "relationship is like husband and wife," there must also be a commonality of interests. U.S. "special procurement" orders are one example. There are still many people interested in "special procurement" orders, especially some in the Japanese ruling class who believe that if Japan wants to rise again, it must borrow the arm of the United States. However, with the development of the Japanese economy, more and more people in the Japanese ruling class hope to get rid of U.S. control and dependence on the United States. Because obtaining "special procurement" orders is not without conditions, the United States not only keeps prices very low and inspections very strict, and may suddenly terminate them at any time, but also the arrogant attitude of the other party when dealing with them is unbearable.
    The fact that the "U.S.-Japan relationship as husband and wife" is not consensual has been described above. As the saying goes, "Cold snaps crack the wall, ice covers the house, dewdrop couples don't last long." This relationship will not be long-lasting. Because not only are the Japanese people unwilling to be in this humiliating position, but the Japanese ruling class has also recently gradually expressed that they are unwilling to be in a situation of being at the beck and call of others for a long time.

### “美日关系为夫妇”

    “美日关系为夫妇”
    刘仲平
    战后，日本出现过一本书，书名叫作“日本的贞操”。这是失身于美国大兵的日本少女的血泪斑斑的手记。“日本的贞操”被蹂躏了，这曾经成为占领下的日本的象征。
    旧金山片面和约缔结以后，据说，美国认为日本已经不再是被占领的了。虽然美军基地还遍布日本，美国大兵依然趾高气扬地徘徊于樱花树下，不过名字已从“占领军”改为“驻军”了。自然，原来那种关于美日关系的象征性说法，也应该相应地有所改变。改变成什么呢？不久以前到任的美国驻日大使麦克阿瑟第二有个好比喻，他说“美日关系如夫妇”！
    从被蹂躏到结为夫妇，这不能不说是地位上的一种提高。但看来这“婚姻”并非两相情愿，倒有些像“西游记”里所写的黄袍怪硬娶百花羞，很有“倚强霸占”的味道。且不说日本老百姓要求修改日美不平等条约，要求“美国鬼子滚回去”的呼声日益响亮，就连日本保守党政府最近不是也说要“调整日美关系”了吗？
    本来，在美国那样的社会里，揭开夫妇关系的帷幕，你就会看到：其实男人是私有主，女人不过是男人的所有物。而从太平洋彼岸不招自来的这位“郎君”，在日本除了作为私有主之外，似乎把日本古武士的“夫权”精神也学了去。这就是：丈夫对于妻子可以任意打骂，支配她的财物，干涉她的自由；而妻子却只能唯恭唯礼，尽扶侍之劳，而无权过问丈夫的行动。
    干涉内政，要求修改宪法，过问军费，圈划基地，限制贸易等等，美国对于日本予取予求，处处要她听话；可是日本要求美国对她开放美国国内市场，并配合她对东南亚的赔偿计划进行亚洲经济活动，美国表示的态度却是：美国经济政策，无须他人指挥。这是“美日关系如夫妇”的一个好例子。
    至于美军在日本，以征服者的优越感威压一切，视日本人如草芥，随意加以凌辱、伤害之类的事情，那就更不要说了。相马原美军枪杀日本农妇事件，美军当局至今还不肯把凶手交给日本司法机关处理。这类事情多得举不胜举，随手摘录几条消息看：
    △2月26日晚上，板付基地的美国兵莱思和瓦尔希殴伤了福冈市花月酒店的女招待林百合子。莱思在同一天晚上又打伤了工友秋田国广，秋田因头盖骨破裂，在第二天死亡。
    △在北海道，札幌郊外美军兵营的美国宪兵，没有驻军司令官签发的搜查证，在2月27日和28日两天接连两次闯入兵营内的女仆集体宿舍，搜查各个房间并且没收物品。
    在美国随军商店中工作的日本妇女控诉美军当局曾经对她们进行搜查身体的侵犯人权的粗暴行为。她们特别指责这种搜查是被强迫脱光衣服并且在很冷的天气中进行的。日本法务省认为这种搜查违犯了日本法律，但是，美军当局的发言人却把这种侮辱人身的搜查说成是“例行”的，说根据美日“行政协定”，在美军机构工作的日本妇女受美国军事条例的管制。这也可以算是“美日关系如夫妇”的好例子。从“私有主”和“夫权”的观点看来，打骂老婆，还不是极平常的事吗？
    自然，既然“关系如夫妇”，也不能没有利益共通的一面。美国的“特需”订货就是一个例子。对“特需”订货感兴趣的人，目前还是大有人在的，特别是日本统治阶级中有那末一些人，认为日本如要东山再起，必须借美国的一臂之力。但是，随着日本经济的发展，在日本统治阶层中希望摆脱美国的控制，摆脱对于美国的依赖的人也越来越多了。因为取得“特需”订货并不是无条件的，美国不仅压价很低，验收很严，说不定什么时候就会突然中止，而且打交道的时候，对方那种盛气凌人的样子，是使人难于忍受的。
    “美日关系如夫妇”之并非两相情愿，已如上述。俗话说：“冷子打墙冰盖房，露水夫妻不久长”，这关系，是不会绵长久远的。因为不仅日本老百姓早就不愿意处于这种屈辱的地位，就是日本的统治阶级近来也渐渐表示不甘长期处于俯仰随人的境况了。（附图片）
