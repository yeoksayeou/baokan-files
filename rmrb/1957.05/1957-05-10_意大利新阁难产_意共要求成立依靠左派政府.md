Xinhua News Agency, Rome, May 9th: The formation of a new Italian cabinet has run into difficulties. President Gronchi suspended consultations with political leaders on the evening of the 8th and decided to resume these efforts next week.

In the past two days, Gronchi has met with the speakers of both houses of parliament and the leaders of the parliamentary groups of various political parties.

Senate Speaker Mezzogora said after his meeting with the President that he believed the current government crisis would not be resolved in the short term.

Communist Party parliamentary group chairman Togliatti issued a statement after his conversation with the President, saying that the Communist Party parliamentary group believes that to escape the current crisis, it is necessary to change the political direction to absorb the masses of working people into the leadership of the country. This requires eliminating the alliance of centrists, ending discrimination against left-wing parties, and establishing a government that, based on the position of the Christian Democratic Party, relies on left-wing parties and refuses to cooperate with the Liberals.

Togliatti also pointed out in "National Evening News" that the movement of agricultural laborers against the Segni government's attempt to abolish the principle of land use contracts was an important factor in the government's downfall, and the Social Democratic Party's withdrawal from the government was merely the fuse for the crisis. Therefore, it is necessary to change the policy direction and basic program.

The Socialist Party parliamentary group also demanded the complete abolition of the outdated measures of the centrist government and called for the establishment of a government that can solve the country's social problems, fully realize the constitution, and defend peace.

    意大利新阁难产
    意共要求成立依靠左派政府
    新华社9日讯　罗马消息：意大利新内阁难产。总统格隆基8日晚上暂停同政界领袖的协商，决定到下星期再进行这种努力。
    格隆基在过去两天中接见了议会上下两院的议长和各政党议会党团的领袖。
    上议院议长梅查戈拉在同总统会谈以后说：他认为这次政府危机不会在短时期内获得解决。
    共产党议会党团主席陶里亚蒂在同总统谈话以后发表声明说：共产党议会党团认为，要摆脱当前的危机就必须改变政治方针，以便吸收劳动人民群众参加国家的领导。这就必须消灭中间派分子的联盟，停止对左翼政党的歧视，而建立一个从天主教民主党的立场出发、依靠左派政党并且拒绝同自由党人合作的政府。
    陶里亚蒂还在“国家晚报”上指出：农业劳动者反对塞尼政府企图废除土地使用契约原则的运动是促使政府垮台的一个重要因素，而社会民主党的退出政府不过是危机爆发的导火线而已。因此，必须改变政策方针和基本纲领。
    社会党议会党团也要求彻底取消中间派分子政府的过时措施，要求建立能解决国家的社会问题、完全实现宪法和保卫和平的政府。
