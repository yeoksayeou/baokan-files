Beijing Agricultural University Exposes Shortcomings in Party Work
Few Party Members Self-Criticize and They are Detached from the Masses

(Our Newspaper) News - Sixty-seven professors, associate professors, and heads of various democratic parties at Beijing Agricultural University, at a symposium held last night by the Chinese Communist Party Beijing Agricultural University Committee, raised many sharp criticisms of bureaucraticism and sectarianism in the school's party-masses relations and administrative leadership. At the start of the symposium, Shi Ping, Party Secretary and Vice-President, hoped everyone would speak freely and help the school's Party organization do a good job in rectification. He said: The key to rectification work lies in the exposure of shortcomings and errors; the more profound the exposure, the better the rectification will be. Then everyone spoke. Wu Ting, professor of the Department of Soil Chemistry, said: "Criticism and self-criticism," "close ties with the masses," and "say all you know and say it without reservation" and other classic slogans have become dogmas in this school. She said: I rarely see Party members at the Agricultural University making public criticisms and self-criticisms among the masses. Party members rarely talk to me, and even when they do, it rarely exceeds twenty words. And the answer I get after talking is often four words, such as "dissatisfied with the Party," "individualistic departure"...etc. This practice of labeling is hard to convince people. After labeling, they report to the Party organization. I suspect that Party members may say less and know more to the organization, and say it without reservation. Our Party has high prestige, and some Party members are therefore proud. They look down on the masses. How can they achieve close ties with the masses? She said: The wall between party-masses relations at our Agricultural University is as thick as Fuxingmen. If Party members can publicly criticize and self-criticize among the masses, this wall can be torn down. Professor Wu Ting spoke of the sense of ownership, saying that I could not have a sense of ownership before liberation, and after liberation, because I have position without power, my sense of ownership is also very little. My instructions to teaching assistants on teaching work must be approved by Party members before the teaching assistants can implement my opinions, which I find objectionable.

Speaking of having position without power, Professor Yu Da-fu also said with emotion that I have traveled many places and seen many people who do things without using their brains. They just do what others tell them to do, without thinking at all. The phenomenon of having position without power creates a guest mentality, which is a great loss to work. Our goals are all the same, which is socialism and communism. If everyone puts the national interest first, bureaucracy and sectarianism can be overcome. Wang Huanru, Associate Professor of the Department of Plant Pathology, said: Our Agricultural University not only has a wall between the Party and the masses, but also a wall between the masses and the masses. To improve Party-masses relations, the masses should move closer to the Party, and Party members should also reach out to the masses. In my seven years at the Agricultural University, only one Party member has talked to me. It can be seen from this that the Party's mass work is not universal and not in-depth.

Professors also had many opinions on the Agricultural University's leadership's arrogance, complacency, bureaucracy, and detachment from the masses. Wu Zhongxian, professor of the Department of Animal Husbandry, pointed out: The tendency of the Agricultural University's leadership to be detached from the masses is quite serious. He said that to run the school well, we must rely on the masses, especially some old professors who have many opinions on how to run the school well, and they also have the power to complete the tasks, but the school leadership has never held a symposium to solicit their opinions. Xue Peiyuan, an old professor of the Department of Soil Chemistry, said that because I am old, the leadership regards me as waste and has not given me teaching tasks for a long time. No one supports the topics I propose for scientific research. Developing farmland irrigation is the key to increasing agricultural production in North China, and my suggestion to establish a farmland irrigation department at the Agricultural University has not been implemented.

At the meeting, Zhang Jinren, Principal Assistant and head of the Democratic League, criticized the Agricultural University's Party organization for not giving enough play to the role of the democratic parties. Professor Cao Xiguang listed many facts to illustrate that Ying Lian-geng, director of the Department of Agricultural Economics (head of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party), had sectarianism in handling problems. Professor Wu Zhongxian criticized the Agricultural University for having more bureaucratic style and less academic atmosphere. Professors also made sharp criticisms of the great style of individual leaders.

Nine people spoke at yesterday's meeting, and the meeting will continue today.

    北京农业大学揭发党的工作的缺点
    党员很少自我批评又脱离群众
    本报讯　北京农业大学六十七位教授、副教授和各民主党派负责人，在昨晚中共北京农业大学委员会召开的座谈会上，就该校党群关系和行政领导方面的官僚主义、宗派主义，提出许多尖锐的批评意见。座谈会开始，党委书记副校长施平希望大家畅所欲言，帮助该校党组织作好整风工作。他说：整风工作的关键在于对缺点和错误的揭发，揭露越深刻，风就能整得更好。接着由大家发言。土化系教授吴亭说：“批评自我批评”、“密切联系群众”、“知无不言言无不尽”等经典口号，在这个学校变成了教条。她说：我很少看到农业大学党员在群众中作公开的批评和自我批评。党员很少和我谈过话，就是谈话每次也很少超过二十个字。而谈过话后对我的回答却常常是四个字，如“对党不满”、“个人出发”……等等，这种扣帽子的做法很难说服人。扣帽子之后就是向党组织汇报，我怀疑党员向组织汇报可能做到知无不言、言无不尽，并且是知少言多。我们党威信很高，有些党员也因此而骄傲了，他们瞧不起群众，如何能做到密切联系群众？她说：我们农业大学隔离党群关系之间的墙有复兴门那么厚，党员要能在群众中公开作批评自我批评，这堵墙就能拆掉。吴亭教授谈到主人翁思想时说，我在解放前不可能有主人翁思想，解放后因为有职无权，我的主人翁思想也很少。我指示助教教学工作的意见，助教执行我的意见时，必须经过党员同意，我有反感。
    谈到有职无权，俞大绂教授也感慨系之的说，我走了很多地方，看见很多人都是不用脑筋办事。别人要他怎么办他就怎么办，根本不动脑筋。有职无权的现象使人产生了作客思想，这对工作是很大的损失。我们大家的目标都是一致的，这就是社会主义和共产主义，如果大家都把国家利益放在第一位，官僚主义和宗派主义就能克服掉。植病系副教授王焕如说：我们农大不仅有党群之间的墙，也有群众和群众之间的墙，党群关系要搞好，群众应向党靠拢，党员也向群众伸出手来。我在农大七年，只有一个党员同我谈过话，党的群众工作不普遍不深入于此可见。
    教授们对农业大学领导方面骄傲自满、官僚主义和脱离群众的作风意见也很大。畜牧系吴仲贤教授指出：农大领导方面脱离群众的倾向相当严重。他说，办好学校必须依靠群众，特别是一部分老教授，他们对怎样办好学校有很多的意见，他们也有力量来完成任务，可是学校领导方面从来没有开一次座谈会来征求他们的意见。土化系薛培元老教授说，我因为上了年纪，领导上就把我看作废物，长期不给我教学任务；我提出科学研究的题目也没人支持。发展农田水利是华北地区增加农业生产的关键，我建议农大建立农田水利系也没有着落。
    会上，民主同盟负责人张进仁校长助理，批评了农大党组织发挥民主党派的作用不够。曹锡光教授列举了许多事实来说明农业经济系主任（农工民主党负责人）应廉耕在处理问题上有宗派主义情绪。吴仲贤教授批评了农大衙门作风多学术风气少。教授们对个别领导人好大作风也提出了尖锐批评。
    昨天在会上发言的有九人，会议将在今日继续进行。
