Xinhua News Agency, 14th Dispatch. According to TASS, the Mongolian Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Bada, held a reception in Moscow on May 13th to mark the visit of the Government Delegation of the Mongolian People's Republic to the Soviet Union.

    Soviet Communist Party and government leaders were invited to attend the reception.

    Mongolian Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Tsedenbal, delivered a speech at the reception, saying that our talks with the leaders of the Soviet Communist Party and government were conducted in a spirit of full understanding, sincerity, and the traditional friendship between our two peoples, and in full compliance with Lenin's principles of socialist internationalism.

    Tsedenbal said that the sincere fraternal friendship and mutual assistance relations between the countries of the socialist camp, headed by the Soviet Union, exist and are constantly strengthening. In this situation, any act of aggression against any one of these countries will provoke the just opposition and retaliatory measures of the entire socialist camp. As long as the friendship between the people of the socialist camp is strong, we will not fear enemies at home or abroad.

    Damba， First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and member of the Presidium, followed with a speech. He said that during the two countries' talks, we deeply felt the sincere willingness of the Soviet leaders to fully and comprehensively help us improve the material welfare of our people and enable our country to rapidly develop on the road of socialist construction.

    Damba said that at present, when international reactionaries are trying to undermine the solidarity of the socialist camp countries, our party believes that its primary responsibility is to further strengthen friendship and cooperation with the Soviet Union and all socialist countries. Our party firmly supports the struggle of the Soviet Communist Party and the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries to strive for the purity of Marxist-Leninist thought and for the unity of all democratic forces in the face of the increasing threat of a new war.

    Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Bulganin, also spoke. He said that the friendship between our two countries and our two peoples began from the earliest days of Soviet Russia's founding. This friendship has withstood the test of time. In the most difficult days of our two countries' lives, we have always been friends and have always helped each other.

    Bulganin said that at present, the talks between the government delegations of the Soviet Union and Mongolia are being conducted in a very sincere and warm atmosphere. The talks show that the two sides have completely identical views on issues related to Soviet-Mongolian relations, on cooperation between countries of the socialist camp, and on the assessment of the international situation and our foreign policy measures.

    Bulganin finally expressed that the visit of the Mongolian comrades to the Soviet Union and the joint talks between the two sides will help further develop and consolidate the fraternal relations and all-round cooperation between the two countries.

    苏蒙友谊经住了时间考验
    两国政府首脑同声强调加强合作
    蒙古驻苏大使举行的招待会中充满手足之情
    新华社14日讯　据塔斯社消息，蒙古驻苏联大使巴达为蒙古人民共和国政府代表团的访问苏联，5月13日在莫斯科举行了招待会。
    苏联共产党和政府领导人应邀出席了招待会。
    蒙古部长会议主席泽登巴尔在招待会上致词说，我们这次同苏联共产党和政府领导人的会谈是本着充分谅解，本着真诚和我们两国人民传统友谊的精神进行的，是在完全符合列宁的社会主义国际主义原则的情况下进行的。
    泽登巴尔说，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国之间真诚的兄弟友谊和相互帮助的关系存在着并且日益加强。在这种情况下，对这些国家中某一个国家采取任何侵略行动都将引起整个社会主义阵营的正当反对和报复性的措施。只要社会主义阵营各国人民的友谊健在，我们就不怕内外的敌人。
    蒙古人民革命党中央委员会第一书记、大人民呼拉尔主席团委员达姆巴接着讲话。他说，在两国会谈过程中，我们深深感到苏联领导人真诚愿意尽力和全面地帮助我们改善人民的物质福利，使我国在社会主义建设道路上迅速发展。
    达姆巴说，目前，当国际反动派力图破坏社会主义阵营国家的团结一致的时候，我们党认为自己首要的责任就是进一步加强同苏联和各社会主义国家的友谊和合作。我们党坚决支持苏联共产党和各国共产党和工人党在新战争威胁日益加强的面前争取马克思列宁主义思想上的纯洁和争取一切民主力量团结一致的斗争。
    苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁也讲了话。他说，我们两国和我们两国人民之间的友谊，从苏维埃俄罗斯成立的最初日子起就已开始了。这个友谊经住了时间的考验。在我们两国生活中最困难的日子里，我们一直是朋友，一直彼此帮助。
    布尔加宁说，目前，苏联和蒙古两国政府代表团的会谈是在非常真挚、热烈的情况下进行的。会谈表明：在苏蒙两国的关系问题上、在社会主义阵营国家合作问题上，以及在对国际局势和我们的外交政策措施的估计上，双方的观点是完全一致的。
    布尔加宁最后表示，蒙古同志们的访问苏联和双方的共同会谈，有助于进一步发展和巩固两国间的兄弟关系和全面合作。
