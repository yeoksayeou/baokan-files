    Why Beijing Cancelled the Free Vegetable Market
    Editor's Note: Regarding the cancellation of the free vegetable market in Beijing, the editorial department of this newspaper has invited responsible comrades from the Beijing Municipal People's Committee to write an article, which will be published soon. We plan to organize a discussion on this issue, and contributions with your opinions are welcome.
    The People's Daily's report on May 8, 1957, regarding "Beijing's Cancellation of the Free Vegetable Market" is difficult for us to understand. In the past, precisely targeting the operating characteristics of fresh vegetables, the measure of opening free markets was adopted, which promoted increased supply, reduced links, improved quality, and increased variety. The newspapers have already published a lot about these benefits.
    Now, Beijing has cancelled the free vegetable market and continues to have the vegetable company handle unified purchasing. Is this approach more beneficial to producers and consumers than opening free markets? Is it necessary for other cities to also cancel them? If free vegetable markets can be cancelled, is it also necessary to cancel free markets for other commodities? These are issues of close concern to everyone, especially commercial workers, and it is also a new issue in opening up free markets. We hope that the responsible comrades of Beijing can provide a public response in the newspaper.

    北京为啥取消蔬菜自由市场
    编者按　关于北京市取消蔬菜自由市场的问题，本报编辑部已经约请北京市人民委员会负责同志写文章，不久即可发表。关于这个问题，本报准备组织讨论，大家如有什么意见，欢迎来稿。
    人民日报在1957年5月8日刊载关于“北京市取消蔬菜自由市场”的报道，使我们很难理解。过去正是针对着鲜蔬菜等的经营特点，采取了开放自由市场的措施，促使上市量增加了，环节减少了，质量提高了，花色品种增多了，这些好处报纸上已经登载很多。
    现在，北京市取消了蔬菜自由市场，仍然由菜蔬公司统一收购。这种做法是否比开放自由市场对生产者和消费者更为有利呢？其他城市是否也有取消的必要呢？蔬菜可以取消自由市场，其他商品是否也有必要取消自由市场呢？这些都是大家密切关心的问题，特别是商业工作者所关心的一个问题，这也是开放自由市场中的一个新问题。希望北京市的负责同志能在报纸上作公开答复。	　江苏省服务厅工作人员　程翼云
