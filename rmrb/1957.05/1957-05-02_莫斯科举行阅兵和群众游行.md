Xinhua News Agency, May 1st: TASS reports: Today, a military parade and mass rally celebrating International Workers' Day were held on Red Square in Moscow.

    Early in the morning, troops were lined up on Red Square and nearby streets, ready to be reviewed. The stands were full of people, including foreign guests who were invited to watch the parade and representatives from all walks of life in the Soviet Union. Standing on the Lenin-Stalin Mausoleum were the leaders of the Soviet Communist Party and government, as well as Soviet marshals and generals of the army and navy.

    At ten o'clock in the morning, the parade ceremony began. Soviet Minister of Defense, Marshal of the Soviet Union Zhukov, reviewed the troops, with Marshal of the Soviet Union Moskalenko serving as the commander of the parade.

    After reviewing the troops in an open-top car, Zhukov ascended the mausoleum and delivered a speech to all the troops, the masses, and the guests who were being reviewed. He said: The Soviet Union is a fervent advocate of peace and friendship between all countries. We oppose the Cold War policy and military blocs. The Soviet people are united with the people of other socialist countries like brothers to counter the aggressive conspiracies of the imperialist bloc. They consider it their responsibility to continuously improve the combat effectiveness of the forces participating in the Warsaw Pact joint forces.

    Marshal Zhukov said that the Soviet people can fully trust their armed forces. Our troops have noble moral and fighting qualities, and possess various modern weapons sufficient to annihilate any aggressor.

    After Zhukov finished his speech, the troops began to march past the reviewing stand in formation. Leading the way were students from the Frunze Military Academy and other military academies, followed by troops from various military branches. The people on Red Square and throughout Moscow enthusiastically watched the air force review.

    The mass rally began after the military parade. As usual, a team of flag bearers led the way, followed closely by Moscow's elementary school students. An army of athletes marched to the reviewing stand and suddenly changed formation to form the words "Lenin."

    The red flags held by the teams from the twelve districts of Moscow surged into Red Square like giant tongues of fire. They held high the portraits of Lenin and the leaders of the Soviet Party and government, and cheered "Long live the Soviet Communist Party!" and "Long live the Soviet government!". Countless banners and slogans reported on production achievements.

    Red Square was a sea of vibrant colors, with countless spring flowers here and golden waves of wheat there.

    A group of young people appeared, holding banners with images of peace doves and other emblems of the World Festival of Youth and Students. The youth held up countless large characters written in the languages of many nations: "Peace." Many banners bore slogans such as: "Strive for disarmament!" "Strive for easing international tensions!" "Stop testing atomic and hydrogen bombs!"

    The marchers shouted "Long live the great Chinese people!" and "Long live the people of all people's democratic countries!", and shouted slogans expressing greetings to the people of other countries.

    莫斯科举行阅兵和群众游行
    新华社1日讯  据塔斯社报道：今天，莫斯科红场上举行了庆祝“五一”节的阅兵和群众游行。
    一清早，红场上和附近的大街上就排列着准备接受检阅的部队。观礼台上站满了人，他们是应邀前来观礼的外国来宾和苏联各界的代表。站在列宁—斯大林陵墓上的是苏联共产党和政府的领导人，以及苏联元帅和陆海军的将军们。
    上午十时，阅兵的仪式开始。苏联国防部长、苏联元帅朱可夫检阅了部队，由苏联元帅莫斯卡连科任阅兵指挥官。
    朱可夫在坐着敞篷汽车检阅了部队以后，登上陵台，向全体接受检阅的部队、群众和来宾发表演说。他说：苏联是和平和各国人民之间的友谊的热烈拥护者。我们反对冷战政策，反对军事集团。苏联人民同社会主义阵营其他国家的人民兄弟般地团结在一起，以对付帝国主义集团的侵略阴谋。他们认为自己的责任是不断提高加入华沙条约联合力量的军队的战斗力。
    朱可夫元帅说，苏联人民可以完全信赖自己的武装部队，我们的部队有崇高的道义和战斗品质，并且拥有各种现代化武器足以歼灭任何侵略者。
    朱可夫演说完毕，军队开始以分列式通过检阅台前面。走在最前面的是伏龙芝军事学院及其他军事学院的学员，接着是各兵种的队伍。在红场上的和整个莫斯科的人一起兴致勃勃地看了空军检阅。
    群众游行在阅兵结束后开始。走在最前面的照例是一队旗手，后面紧跟着莫斯科的小学生。一支体育大军走到检阅台前面，忽地改变了队形，组成了“列宁”的字样。
    莫斯科十二个区的队伍所举的红旗像巨大的火舌一样地卷入了红场。他们高举着列宁和苏联党和政府的领导人们的像，欢呼苏联共产党和苏联政府万岁。无数的横幅和标语上报告着生产成绩。
    红场上真是万紫千红，这里是无数朵的春花，那里又是一片金黄色的麦浪。
    一群青年举着画有和平鸽和世界青年与学生联欢节的其他徽记的横幅出现了。青年们举着无数用世界许多民族的文字写成的大字：“和平”。在许多横幅上写着这样的口号：争取裁军！争取缓和国际紧张局势！停止试验原子弹和氢弹！
    游行者高呼伟大的中国人民、各人民民主国家的人民万岁，高呼向其他各国的人民致敬的口号。
