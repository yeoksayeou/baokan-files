    Stand Higher, See Further
  　Shi Lin
    In just two months, more than ten thousand graduating students from higher and secondary vocational schools across the country will be taking up work positions as socialist construction cadres. At this important moment on the eve of stepping into life, students are all considering how to make greater contributions to the country, and at the same time, planning for their own futures. The example of 145 graduating students from the Beijing Agricultural Mechanization Institute volunteering to go to Mishan to support land reclamation represents the fearless spirit of our era's youth; "Go wherever the organization directs," "Go to the frontier! Go to the arduous places! Go where the motherland needs you most!" have become the battle cries of the students; graduating students from the Beijing Petroleum Institute have issued heroic and bold statements: "Break through the Qilian Mountains, carve through the vast Gobi!" These are the voices of our era's youth.
    However, there are also some students who are not moved by these voices of the times. They think too much about personal interests and too little about the interests of the country and how they can contribute to the country. Some students divide future jobs into grades: scientific research is first-class, being a teaching assistant is second-class, going to industrial and mining enterprises is third-class, and being a middle school teacher is fourth-class... therefore, they only want to do "first-class" work and are unwilling to do other things; some students openly state that they want to work in large cities and are unwilling to go to the frontier and rural areas, reasoning that "large cities have bright electric lights, smooth roads, and rich cultural life, while life in the frontier and rural areas is hard, culture is lacking, and it is difficult to find a love interest"; some are willing to go to the frontier, but have other ideas: "The salary is high there, and promotions are fast"; a student at a certain university in Xi'an even demanded this specifically: "The place I volunteer to go to is with Xi'an as the center, and Xianyang, Sanyuan, and Lintong as the radius. I won't go beyond this circle." As for those who disregard the needs of the country and make various demands under the pretext of "taking care of the family," "serving parents," or "not being accustomed to life in other places," they are not unique cases.
    I dare not rashly put the "hat" of individualism on these students, because based on each person's specific situation, it seems they all have some "reasons," but these plans and ideas cannot be said to be a very healthy emotion, and it is really incompatible with the honorary title of socialist university student, let alone a Communist Party member or Communist Youth League member. Even if we consider it from the perspective of personal future, these plans and ideas are too short-sighted and too vulgar! Frontier, rural areas, and small cities are naturally more difficult to live in than large cities, and going to those places to work will naturally encounter many difficulties (in fact, any job has difficulties), but who is willing to sit back and enjoy the fruits of others' labor, cherish that peaceful and comfortable life, and avoid hardships and difficulties if they are a youth with ambition, aspiration, ideals, and a willingness to truly do something for socialism? The future must be fought for through hardship and difficulty. In the future, the frontiers, rural areas, and every corner of the motherland will be filled with socialist flowers. If we can participate in this pioneering work with our own hands and be determined to work there for a lifetime, we will surely personally enjoy the fruits of our hard work in the future. Wouldn't that be the greatest happiness and the most beautiful future in life! Some students who only consider problems in life, looking forward and backward, and being afraid of everything, should quickly abandon those many short-sighted and vulgar "burdens." If the country wants to assign you to the frontier, rural areas, and all arduous places, then bravely stride forward on this glorious journey! Bearing hardship before enjoying comfort, not avoiding difficulties, and not being afraid of "suffering losses" is the most far-sighted plan for personal future. It is okay to consider personal future, but you should stand higher and see further. Here, Confucius's words "Ascending Mount Dongshan makes Lu seem small, ascending Mount Tai makes the whole world seem small" are applicable.

    站得高些，看得远些
  　石林
    再过两个月，全国即将有十多万高等和中等专业学校的毕业同学以社会主义建设干部的身份走上工作岗位了。在临到走向生活前夕这个重要的时刻，同学们都正在考虑如何为国家作出更大的贡献，同时也在为自己的前途而打算。北京农业机械化学院的一百四十五位毕业同学志愿前往密山支援垦荒的事例，代表了我们时代青年不怕艰苦不畏困难的风姿；“组织指向那里就到那里”，“到边疆去！到艰苦的地方去！到祖国最需要的地方去！”成了同学们的战斗口号；北京石油学院的毕业同学发出了英雄豪迈的语言：“打通祁连山，凿穿大戈壁！”这些都是我们时代青年的声音。
    但是，也有一部分同学并没有为这些时代的声音所激动。他们在个人利益的问题上想得太多，而对国家的利益和自己如何对国家有贡献的问题则考虑得太少。有的同学把未来的工作分成等级：科学研究是一等，作助教是二等，到工矿企业是三等，当中学教员是四等……因而只愿干“一等”工作，不愿意作其它事情；有的同学公开表示，要在大城市工作，不愿意到边疆和农村，理由是“大城市电灯明亮，马路平坦，文化生活丰富，边疆和农村生活苦，文化贫乏，找不到恋爱对象”；有的愿意到边疆，却有另外的想头：“那里薪金高，提拔快”；西安市某个高等学校有位同学甚至要求得这样具体：“我志愿到的地方，是以西安为圆心，以咸阳、三原、临潼为半径，出了这个圈子我就不去。”至于丢开国家的需要不管，以“照顾家庭”、“侍奉父母”、“过不惯外地生活”为辞而提出各种要求的，也不是绝无仅有。
    我不敢贸然以个人主义的“帽子”加在这些同学的头上，因为从每个人的具体情况出发，似乎他们都多少有点“理由”，但是这些打算和想法，不能不说是一种很不健康的情绪，它实在和社会主义大学生这个荣誉的称号不相称，至于共产党员和青年团员那就更不用说了。我们即使从个人前途来考虑，这些打算和想法，也未免太短视、太庸俗了！边疆、农村和小城市，比起大城市来，生活上自然要艰苦一些，到那些地方去工作自然会遇着许多困难（其实任何工作都是有困难的），但是一个有志向、有抱负、有理想、愿意真正为社会主义作一番事业的青年，谁愿意坐享其成，眷恋那种平静舒适的生活而逃避艰苦和困难？前途是要从艰难困苦当中奋斗出来的。将来的边疆、农村，祖国的每一个角落，都要开满社会主义的鲜花，如果我们能够以自己的双手去参加这个披荆斩棘的工作，并且下定决心在那里去干一辈子，将来必定会亲自享受到自己辛勤劳动的成果，那岂不是人生最大的幸福和最美好的前途！一些只在生活上考虑问题，瞻前顾后、畏首畏尾的同学们，应该迅速抛下那许多短视而庸俗的“包袱”，如果国家要分配你到边疆、农村和一切艰苦的地方，你就勇敢地迈开脚步踏上这个光荣的征程吧！吃苦在前，享福在后，不避困难，不怕“吃亏”，这是对个人前途最长远的打算。考虑个人前途是可以的，但是应该站得高些，看得远些，在这里用得着孔子说的“登东山而小鲁，登泰山而小天下”这两句话。
