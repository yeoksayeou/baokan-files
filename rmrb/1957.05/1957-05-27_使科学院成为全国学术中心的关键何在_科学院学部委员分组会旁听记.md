The key to making the Academy of Sciences a national academic center

-- Notes from observing a group meeting of academicians of the Academy of Sciences
By our reporter

The Academy of Sciences should lead the work of its affiliated research units well, becoming a "center of scientific research"; at the same time, the Academy of Sciences should also face the whole country, becoming the Academy of Sciences for scientists nationwide, and becoming an academic center for leading science nationwide. The key to achieving this lies in how to give play to the role of the academic divisions. On the 24th, 25th, and 26th, the second plenary meeting of the Academic Divisions of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Biology Division, focused on discussing this issue. The Earth Sciences Division, the Technological Sciences Division, and the Physics, Mathematics, and Chemistry Division also touched upon this issue.

What is the nature and task of the academic divisions? What does the Academy of Sciences rely on to lead academics? Dai Fanglan, an expert in applied mycology, said that such basic questions were previously unclear among the academicians and the leaders of the Academy of Sciences. As a result, the academic divisions did not play a good role, and even had conflicts with the administrative departments of the Academy, instead of receiving their cooperation. Li Xun, a metallurgist, also felt that the establishment of the academic divisions seemed to increase the internal contradictions of the Academy of Sciences. Dai Fanglan cited examples to illustrate this phenomenon. For example, the application of the Institute of Applied Mycology to build a greenhouse in Zhongguancun, in the western suburbs of Beijing, was "approved" one moment and then denied the next, all depending on the relevant bureau in the Academy. The academic divisions could not manage it at all. He said that the research plan formulated by the research institute under the leadership of the academic divisions could also be overturned by a bureau in the Academy. Chen Shixiang, an entomologist, also cited similar examples encountered by the Institute of Entomology. The academicians expressed doubt whether the main body of the Academy of Sciences was formed by several academic divisions. Wei Xi, deputy director of the Dalian Biological Products Institute, said: "The Academy of Sciences seems to be just the Academy of Sciences at No. 3 Wenjin Street (meaning only composed of various bureaus). I hope this is just a transitional situation and hope to change this situation." Luo Zongluo, a plant physiologist, said, "The academic divisions seem to have become a kind of decoration for the Academy of Sciences."

The academic divisions are composed of more than 230 academicians, but how much role has each academician played? The academicians raised this question. Wang Zhixi said at the group meeting of the Technological Sciences Division, "It is doubtful how much role the forty-odd academicians of the Technological Sciences Division have played in leading scientific research." Huang Ziqing, a professor at Peking University, pointed out at the group meeting of the Physics, Mathematics, and Chemistry Division that one of the reasons why the academicians had not played a good role was that the academicians were still unclear about their responsibilities. He felt from his own experience that "the academicians are somewhat like rubber stamps. Using people as rubber stamps will not bring out their initiative." Feng Depei, a physiologist, said: "Each academician does not know where he is standing now." It was unanimously affirmed by the academicians that the academicians should play a greater and more active role than in the past. The question is how to play this role? In addition to clarifying the tasks of the academic divisions and the academicians, several academicians proposed that the academicians must first have their own academic work. Feng Depei said: "If the academicians set an example in academics and are respected by the national scientific community, they can play a leading role in national academics." Luo Zongluo also believed that if the academicians have no academic work, it is impossible to talk about academic leadership, let alone leadership of young people. Some people at the meeting also made suggestions on how the academicians should work specifically. Bing Zhi, a zoologist, proposed that the academicians could follow the example of people's representatives, inspect various places, accept the opinions of scientists, and submit them to the academic divisions. He said: "As long as the tasks are clarified, the academicians will have a lot of work to do in a year, and they can play a role in promoting science throughout the country." Zhang Zhaoqian, a tropical plant scientist, also made the same suggestion. He also believed that academicians scattered in various places can participate in local scientific institutions in order to understand and help local scientific work, and at the same time implement some of the matters decided in the central government to the local level, and organize local forces to work together to complete the overall scientific plan.

The academicians specifically considered the current status of the academic divisions. Currently, the academic divisions are under the leadership of the president of the Academy of Sciences and under the leadership of the Academy Affairs Committee of the Academy of Sciences. Many people believe that this situation is abnormal. Tang Peisong, a plant physiologist, said: "The academic divisions should not be led by the Academy Affairs Committee, because the academic divisions are academic institutions." Si Xingjian, a paleontologist, also raised the same opinion at the group meeting of the Earth Sciences Division. Sheng Tongsheng, deputy director of the Preparatory Committee of the Northwest Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, analyzed that if the Academy of Sciences is duty-bound to become an academic center for leading science throughout the country, it must rely on scientists across the country, and first of all rely on and trust the academic divisions. The academic divisions should be the highest leading organization of the Academy of Sciences, and the president and the Academy Affairs Committee are the executors of the decisions of the academic divisions, and should be led and supervised by the academic divisions. Therefore, Dai Songen, an agronomist, suggested that it is necessary to "upgrade" the academic divisions from their current position. Several scientists agreed with this view. If the academic divisions really play a role, it can not only unite scientists to become an academic center for leading science throughout the country, but also assume the task of the State Council's Science Planning Commission. Sheng Tongsheng said: "Last year, the drafting of the scientific twelve-year long-term plan by the Science Planning Commission was actually the strength of the academic divisions plus some relevant scientists, but with a few more responsible persons such as the secretary-general of the Science Planning Commission. If the administrative leadership of the Academy of Sciences is not strong enough, it can bring some of the leaders of the Science Planning Commission to the Academy of Sciences to participate in the work, without setting up another empty institution." He also said: "The establishment of the Science Planning Commission seems to indicate that the country does not trust scientists enough. As long as they are given power and confidence is cultivated, the academic divisions can shoulder the tasks of the Science Planning Commission."

On the 26th, the academicians of the Biology Division once again had a heated discussion on how the Academy of Sciences can form an academic center for leading science throughout the country through the academic divisions. They put forward a preliminary program, namely, "The Academy of Sciences is a center of scientific research, and at the same time, through the activities of the academic divisions, it becomes a center of academic leadership"; "The academic divisions are the power institutions of the Academy of Sciences' academic leadership, on a par with the Academy Affairs Committee, with division of labor and close cooperation, to overcome the past phenomenon of disconnection between administration and the work of the academic divisions." There was debate about this program. One view was that this should be done, so that the academic divisions can truly become an academic center for leading science, and the Academy of Sciences can truly face the whole country. Another view was: "Center," "leadership," and so on, are formed by relying on the practical academic work of the Academy of Sciences and the academic divisions, and should not be "self-proclaimed" in this way. Another view was that it is unrealistic to separate academics and administration so clearly. It can be considered to create a leading organization above the academic divisions and the Academy Affairs Committee, similar to the Presidium of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, which can take care of academic leadership and ensure that the administration provides timely guarantees in terms of material and human resources. Another view was: The Academy of Sciences and the academic divisions should not add too much responsibility, and should not talk too much about "leadership," "center," etc. They should spend more energy considering what China currently lacks in academics, what should be done, and how to do it, etc.

    使科学院成为全国学术中心的关键何在
    ——科学院学部委员分组会旁听记
    本报记者
    科学院应该领导好所属研究单位的工作，成为“科学研究的中心”；同时，科学院也应该面向全国，成为全国科学家的科学院，成为领导全国科学的学术中心。要做到这一点，关键在于如何发挥学部的作用。24日、25日和26日，在中国科学院学部委员会第二次全体会议生物学部的分组会上，集中地讨论了这个问题，地学部、技术科学学部和物理学数学化学学部的分组会上，也谈到这个问题。
    学部的性质、任务是什么？科学院依靠什么来领导学术？应用真菌学家戴芳澜说，这样的基本问题，以往在学部委员中、在科学院的领导人中，都是不明确的。以致学部没有很好地发挥作用，甚至在进行工作中同院里的事务部门各局发生了矛盾，而不是得到各事务部门的配合。金属学家李熏也感到，学部的成立似乎反而增多了科学院的内部矛盾。戴芳澜举出例子说明这种现象。如应用真菌研究所要在北京西郊中关村建立温室的事，一会“批准”，一会又否定，都只取决于院里的有关局，学部竟然管不了。他说，研究所在学部领导下拟定了研究计划，院里的一个局也会给推翻的。昆虫学家陈世骧，也举出了昆虫研究所遇到的类似的事例。科学院的主体是不是由几个学部形成的，学部委员们表示怀疑。大连生物制品所副所长魏曦说：“科学院似乎只是文津街三号的科学院（意即仅由各局所组成）。希望这只是一种过渡情况，并且希望改变这种情况。”植物生理学家罗宗洛说，“学部似乎已经成了科学院的一种装饰品。”
    学部是由二百三十多位学部委员组成的，每一位学部委员又发挥了多大的作用呢？学部委员们提出这个问题。王之玺在技术科学学部的分组会上说，“即如技术科学学部的四十多位学部委员，对领导科学研究发挥了多大作用，就值得怀疑。”北京大学教授黄子卿在物理学数学化学学部的分组会上提出，学部委员之所以没有很好发挥作用，原因之一是学部委员到现在还不明确自己的责任。他从自己的经验中感到，“学部委员有些像橡皮图章的作用。把人当橡皮图章使用，是不会发挥他的积极作用的”。生理学家冯德培说：“每个学部委员不知道自己现在是站在什么地方。”学部委员应该发挥比过去更大的积极作用，这是学部委员们一致肯定的。问题在于如何发挥？除了明确学部和学部委员的任务以外，好几位学部委员提出，首先要学部委员有自己的学术工作。冯德培说：“如果学部委员在学术上做出榜样，得到全国科学界的尊敬，就可以对全国的学术起领导作用。”罗宗洛也认为，如果学部委员没有学术工作，是谈不上学术领导的，对年轻人的领导也谈不上。学部委员如何具体工作，会上也有人提出了建议。动物学家秉志提出，学部委员可以仿照人民代表的办法，到各地视察，接受科学家们的意见，提交学部。他说：“只要把任务明确起来，学部委员一年会有许多工作可以做的，而且可以起推动全国科学的作用的。”热带植物学家张肇骞也提出同样的意见。他还认为，分散在各地的学部委员，可以参加当地的科学机构，以便了解和帮助地方上的科学工作，同时把在中央决定的一些事项贯彻到地方上去，组织地方上的力量共同为完成总的科学规划而努力。
    学部委员们具体考虑到学部目前所处的地位。现在学部是在院长的领导之下，是在科学院的院务委员会领导之下，许多人认为这种情况是不正常的。植物生理学家汤佩松说：“学部不应该受院务委员会的领导，因为学部是学术机构。”古生物学家斯行健在地学部的分组会上，也提出了同样的意见。中国科学院西北分院筹备委员会副主任盛彤笙分析，科学院要义不容辞地成为领导全国科学的学术中心，就必须依靠全国的科学家，而首先要依靠学部、相信学部。学部应该是科学院的最高领导组织，而院长、院务委员会是学部决议的执行者，应该受学部的领导、监督。所以农学家戴松恩建议：学部有必要从现在的地位“提升一级”。好几位科学家都同意这个意见。如果学部真正起了作用，它不仅可以团结科学家成为领导全国科学的学术中心，而且可以负起国务院科学规划委员会的任务。盛彤笙说：“去年科学规划委员会的拟定科学十二年远景规划，实际还是学部的力量再加上一些有关的科学家，只不过多了科学规划委员会的秘书长等几位负责人而已。如果科学院的行政领导力量不够，尽可以把科学规划委员会的一些领导人调来科学院参加工作，不必另设一个空机构。”他还说：“科学规划委员会的建立，似乎是表示国家对科学家还不够信任。只要赋予权力，培养信心，学部可以担负起科学规划委员会的任务的。”
    26日，生物学部的学部委员们再一次就科学院如何通过学部形成领导全国科学的学术中心，热烈地进行了讨论。他们提出了初步纲领，即“科学院是科学研究的中心，同时通过学部的活动，成为学术领导的中心”；“学部是科学院的学术领导的权力机构，与院务委员会平列，分工而密切合作，克服过去行政与学部工作脱节的现象”。对这个纲领，大家有争论。一种意见认为：这样做是应该的，可以使学部真正成为领导科学的学术中心，可以使科学院能真正面向全国。另一种意见认为：“中心”、“领导”等等，是依靠科学院、学部的切实的学术工作形成的，不应该是这样“自封”的。还有一种意见认为：这样把学术和行政截然分开是不现实的，可以考虑在学部和院务委员会之上再产生一领导机构，类似苏联科学院的主席团，既能照顾学术领导，又能使行政在物质、人力等条件上及时提供保证。再一种意见是：科学院、学部不要把责任加得太大，不要太多地谈论“领导”、“中心”等等，应该把精力多用点去考虑我国目前在学术上缺少什么，应该努力什么，如何努力，等等。
