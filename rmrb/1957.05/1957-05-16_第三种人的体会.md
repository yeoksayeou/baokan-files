Title: The Experiences of a Third Kind of Person

I have already said that there are people who fear democracy, and there are people who fear the lack of democracy. But in reality, there is a third kind of person who fears both democracy and the lack of democracy; they fear both sides.

I myself am someone who has experienced both sides of this fear, and I know the ins and outs of it well.

I am a Communist Party member, and I have also been an "eighth-rank official," wielding power in a small circle. At that time, I mainly feared democracy, often shouting, "Too much democracy, not enough centralism." The reasons for this fear: first, for the Party and the country; second, a bit for simplicity and avoiding trouble; and third, because I knew my foundation was weak and my imposing facade had to be maintained, fearing that the democracy of the masses would squeeze me out. The arrogance of the ruler combined with the timidity of the small property owner, outwardly stern but inwardly weak, led me to use the power at hand to suppress democracy. However, it ultimately led to my own downfall.

But at that time and afterwards, I also suffered from the lack of democracy of certain people, and sometimes I was a little afraid of them. But in the end, I didn't think there was anything to be afraid of, for the reasons stated in the article "Don't Be Afraid of the Lack of Democracy."

I think I am not the only one who embodies such a contradiction of fearing both democracy and the lack of democracy.

Some dogmatists use their own dogmas to scare others, and are in turn scared by the dogmas of others; some sectarianists exclude this and exclude that, and are in turn excluded by other sectarianists; some bureaucrats are themselves arrogant and domineering, and are in turn subjected to the arrogance of other bureaucrats; in the relationship between Party members and non-Party members, Party members have their faults, but also have their difficulties; the masses are wronged, but seem to be somewhat unforgiving...

Contradictions are so complex and intricate. Precisely because they are so complex and intricate, in the vast majority of cases, although there are differences in weight and importance, there are still some elements of right and wrong within them. Therefore, contradictions are non-antagonistic, and as long as everyone lays things out, they can always distinguish between right and wrong, achieve unity, and there is no need to be afraid.

However, there are still many people today who talk about fear, fearing this and fearing that. What is the root cause of this?

I have done some preliminary investigation and research, and the situation seems very complex, but generally speaking, it is a matter of not grasping the bottom line.

Those who fear democracy have not yet grasped the bottom line, have not grasped the essence of Chairman Mao's speeches, and have not grasped the laws of socialist social development.

Those who fear the lack of democracy, however, have various situations: some have not yet grasped the bottom line of Chairman Mao's speeches; some have grasped this bottom line, but have not yet grasped their own bottom line, not knowing whether they are fragrant flowers or poisonous weeds, fearing that they are indeed poisonous weeds, so it is better not to let them bloom. This is not fear, but their conscience, their shortcomings, only they have not adopted the method of letting others help them to feel out their bottom line; some people have already grasped the bottom line, and their open talk of "fear" shows that they are no longer afraid; there are also some people who have grasped the bottom line of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, but have not yet grasped the bottom line of some people who have repeatedly displayed a correct face despite theoretical reversals, so they are only afraid of speaking to these people, but only fear causing trouble for these people, and not other fears.

I think these situations are not strange, but a law-governed process. A person wading in the water always cautiously tests the water step by step at first, and only after definitely feeling the depth of the bottom will they be completely relieved to go into the water.

Now the key issue lies with those who fear democracy. If they gradually make people feel, not only in words but also in actions, that they are truly not afraid of democracy, then the fear of those who fear the lack of democracy will naturally disappear quickly.

More than a month ago, I heard from several friends that a certain person in charge hastily convened a forum, asking them to boldly offer opinions on bureaucracy, but they said they needed to prepare, and had nothing to say for the moment. So, the person in charge concluded, "There is no need to prepare to express these opinions. What is prepared must be false. You are still afraid, and fear is wrong." After the meeting, the attendees were unhappy, because as a result of the forum, they were criticized again for being "false" and "wrong."

In my opinion, those who were unhappy were a bit narrow-minded, but the one who drew the conclusion was also a bit impatient. This is another contradiction that arises in resolving contradictions.

    第三种人的体会	弗先
    我已经说过有一种怕民主的人，有一种怕不民主的人，但实际上，还有第三种人，他既怕民主、又怕不民主；两面怕。
    我自己就是两面怕的过来人，深知其中的底细的。
    我是共产党员，而且做过“八品文官”，在小小的范围里当过权。那时候，我主要的是怕民主，常常大喊“民主有余，集中不足”。这怕的原因：第一，也是为党为国；第二，也有点图简单怕麻烦；第三，则是自己知道基础薄弱而大架子是要维持的，怕群众的民主来挤。统治者的骄横和小私有者的怯懦结合起来，色厉而内荏，就利用在手的权力对民主实行压。然而，终于是自己的垮台。
    但就在那时和以后，我也吃过某些人的不民主的苦头，有时也很有点怕他们，但到底也觉得没有什么可怕，道理就是如“不要怕不民主”一文中所说的。
    像我这样怕民主和怕不民主的矛盾集于一身的人，我想不会是独一无二的。
    某些教条主义者，以自己的教条吓唬别人，而又为别人的教条所吓唬；某些宗派主义者，自己排这排那，而又为别的宗派主义者所排；某些官僚主义者自己盛气凌人，而又为别的官僚主义者的盛气所凌；在党员同非党员的关系中，党员有不是，但又有苦衷；群众受委屈，但似乎也有些不谅人的地方……
    矛盾就是这样错综复杂的。正因为这样错综复杂，所以在绝大多数的场合，尽管有重轻主次之分，但另有几分是非在里面，所以，矛盾是非对抗性的，所以，只要大家摊开来，总可以分清是非，达到团结，用不到怕的。
    然而，现在还有很多人讲怕，怕这怕那。这原因到底在哪里呢？
    我初步作了一些调查研究，情况似乎很复杂，但总的说来是摸底不摸底的问题。
    那些怕民主的，是还没有摸底，没有摸到毛主席的讲话的实质，没有摸到社会主义社会发展的规律。
    那些怕不民主的，却有种种情形：有的，也还是没有摸到毛主席的讲话的底；有的摸到这底了，却还没有摸到自己的底，不知道自己到底是香花或毒草，恐怕自己确实是毒草，所以还是不放的好，这倒不是怕，乃是他们的良心，他们的缺点，只是没有采取让人家帮助摸一摸的办法；有的人，是已经摸了底的，他们公开谈出“怕”来，就说明他们已经不怕；也有的人，党中央和毛主席的底是摸清的了，但是，对有些理论几经反复而一直摆出正确面孔的人的底还没有摸到，所以他们只是怕对这些人讲话，但也只是怕惹这些人的麻烦，倒不是其他的怕。
    我看，这些情况并不奇怪，是一个合规律的过程。一个涉水的人，开初总是一步一步小心谨慎地探脚，确定地摸到了水底的深浅，然后才会完全放心大胆下水的。
    现在问题的关键，是在那些怕民主的人的方面，他们倘若逐渐地不但以言语而且以行动使人觉得他们真正不怕民主了，那么，怕不民主的人的怕，自然会很快消失了。
    一个多月以前听几位朋友说，有一个负责人，仓卒召集他们座谈，要他们对官僚主义大胆提意见，但他们说是要准备准备，一时都没有话讲。于是，那负责人作结论说：“讲这些意见是用不到准备的，准备出来的一定是假话。你们还是怕，而怕是错误的。”到会的人散了以后都不高兴，因为座谈的结果，又挨了“假”和“错误”的批评。
    我看，不高兴者未免有点儿量窄，但那作结论者也未免有点儿性急。这是在解决矛盾中发生的又一个矛盾。
