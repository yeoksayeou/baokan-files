Democratic Parties' Representatives at the Ministry of Communications Hold a Forum
Criticize Bureaucracy and Subjectivism

    This newspaper reports that the Communist Party Committee of the Ministry of Communications held a forum on the afternoons of May 16th, 17th, and 22nd, inviting forty-six representatives from democratic parties within the ministry to listen to their opinions on the work of the Party and the ministry.
    Qiu Kehui, alternate member of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League and head of the Ministry of Communications branch, said that bureaucracy in the Ministry of Communications is quite serious, mainly manifested in the absence of principles, vision, and planning, resulting in a busy and chaotic existence. The organization is large and overlapping, with unclear divisions of labor and an excess of deputies, secretaries, and dispatchers. Taking the Highway Bureau as an example, this bureau has seven directors and deputy directors, five chief engineers, and more than thirty section chiefs, overseen by a full-time deputy minister and a ministerial assistant. The Ministry of Communications has formulated a large number of regulations in recent years, many of which are copied from the Soviet Union and are inconsistent with the actual situation; even when regulations exist, they are not followed. Wang Bingnan, a member of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, said that the Ministry of Communications leadership pays too little attention to work systems, and the organizational structure changes frequently, almost every year for the past seven years. Insufficient consideration is given when adjusting the structure; for example, the responsibilities of the Inspection Section of the Commerce Bureau are unclear, and when asked, the director himself does not know.
    Wu Changyu, a member of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, said that some work in the Ministry of Communications is carried out solely based on subjective wishes. For example, the draft "Water Transport Technology Transformation Plan" only considers the needs of transportation tasks and stipulates that by 1960, comprehensive and large-scale transformations must be carried out on all aspects of technical tools and equipment for water transport. Among these, there is no guarantee that the provision to "basically eliminate high-temperature operations before 1960" can be achieved. Qian Boxin, a member of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, said that the construction of the coal wharf at Yuxikou Port only considered the discharge capacity of Yuxikou Port, without considering the intake capacity of Shanghai Port. Once the amount of coal transported from Yuxikou Port to Shanghai increases, the barge capacity of Shanghai Port will be insufficient.
    Yang Yitang, member of the Central Executive Bureau of the China Democratic League and head of the Ministry of Communications branch, said that the Ministry of Communications also exhibits sectarianism towards non-Party cadres. He said that he came to the ministry in 1949 as the deputy director of the General Office, but in these eight years, not a single Party deputy minister has talked to him about his work. Qiu Kehui said that as long as someone is a Party member, they can become the head of a technical section even if they don't understand the technology, and those who have not attended university can become the director of a research institute. This is sectarianism. Chen Xuxian, a member of the China Democratic League, said that some leaders only "lead" without "guiding." The so-called "leading" means merely reviewing documents and stamping them, because they do not understand the business and cannot "guide," and their political theory is also poor, so they cannot "guide." Chen Xuxian also said: Communist Party members are like drums, able to talk a lot, like drumming, sounding loudly, but once punctured, it turns out there is only an empty shell.
    The forum will continue.

### 交通部民主党派代表座谈  对官僚主义主观主义提出批评

    交通部民主党派代表座谈
    对官僚主义主观主义提出批评
    本报讯　中共交通部机关党委，于5月16、17、 22日三天的下午，邀请部内四十六位民主党派代表座谈，听取他们对党和机关工作的意见。
    民主同盟中央候补委员、交通部支部负责人丘克辉说，交通部的官僚主义相当严重，主要表现在无方针，无远见，无规划，忙忙乱乱过日子，机构庞大重叠，分工不明，副职多、秘书多、收发多。以公路总局为例，这个局有七个正副局长，五位总工程师，三十多位处长，上有专职副部长和部长助理。交通部几年来订了一大堆制度，很多都是照抄苏联的，跟实际情况不一致；有了制度，也没有照制度办事。国民党革命委员会成员王炳南说，交通部领导对工作制度上的考虑少，机构变动大，七年来几乎每年都有变动，调整机构时考虑不够，例如商务局检查科职掌不明，问局长，局长也不知道。
    国民党革命委员会成员吴昌遇说，交通部有些工作只凭主观愿望来办。如“水上运输技术改造方案”草案中，只是根据运输任务的需要，规定在1960年以前，对水上运输各个方面的技术工具和设备都要进行全面的大规模的改造。其中如“在1960年以前基本消灭高温作业”这一条就没有把握做到。农工民主党成员钱伯辛说，裕溪口港煤码头的建设只考虑了裕溪口港的吐出量，而没有考虑上海港的吞进量，一旦裕溪口港运上海的煤增加了，上海港的驳船运力就不够用。
    民主同盟中央执行局委员、交通部总支负责人杨逸棠说，交通部对非党干部也有宗派主义。他说，他从1949年到部，职位是办公厅副主任，但这八年来从没有一个党员副部长找他谈过工作。丘克辉说，只要是党员，不懂技术的可以做技术处长，没有念过大学的，可以做研究院长，这就是宗派主义。民主同盟盟员陈煦安说，有些领导是领而不导。所谓领就是批批公文盖盖章，因为不懂业务就无法“导”，政治理论也很差，也无法“导”。陈煦安还说：共产党员像个鼓，能讲一大套，好像敲鼓一样，咚咚响，但是一经戳破，原来只有一个空架子。
    座谈会仍将继续举行。
