Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 18th: Seoul dispatch: American rats brought to South Korea by ships transporting American surplus goods are multiplying in large numbers in South Korea, causing increasing harm.

It is estimated that there are now sixty million American rats in South Korea, equivalent to three times the population of South Korea. If each rat eats one *dou* of grain a year, these American rats will consume six million *shi* (one *shi* is approximately 150 kilograms) of grain annually.

According to a report by the Korean Central News Agency, a South Korean agriculturalist said, concerning the harm caused by these rats, that they are large in size and have a strong reproductive capacity, with a male and female pair capable of breeding more than two million offspring in two years. Now, these American rats are found throughout South Korea, acting as carriers of germs and harming crops.

    美国鼠祸害南朝鲜
    新华社平壤18日电汉城消息：由运送美国剩余物资的船只带到南朝鲜来的美国老鼠在南朝鲜大量繁殖，为害日甚。
    据估计，现在南朝鲜有六千万只美国老鼠，相当于南朝鲜人口的三倍。如果按一只老鼠一年吃一斗粮食计算，这些美国老鼠每年就要消耗六百万石（一石约等于一百五十公斤）粮食。
    据朝鲜中央通讯社报道，一个南朝鲜农业学家谈这种老鼠的害处说，它的身体大，繁殖力强，雌雄一对两年内能繁殖二百多万只。现在这种美国老鼠遍布南朝鲜各地，充当病菌的媒介，并且危害农作物。
