Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, May 27th: Taiwan newspapers reported that students in central and southern Taiwan have been holding various anti-American patriotic rallies for days.

Students at Tunghai University in Taichung, a Christian school receiving subsidies from the United States, held a mass rally on the evening of the 24th. During his speech, President Tseng Yueh-nung shed tears when discussing the case of the American soldier killing a Chinese person. On the 25th, all students of Tunghai University refused to attend a gathering held by an American professor, expressing their protest against American aggression.

On the evening of the 24th, students of Taichung Agricultural College also held a mass rally to protest the American verdict of not guilty for the murderer Reynolds, and passed six resolutions, including organizing a demonstration. On the morning of the 25th, students of Taichung Agricultural College gathered again to discuss specific steps for the demonstration and protest to the United States. After the meeting, the students of the Agricultural College were subjected to all sorts of threats and intimidation by Chiang Kai-shek's agents.

Students from many schools in Keelung City also held meetings on the 24th to discuss the "Reynolds Incident." Keelung's "People's Daily" said on the 25th that students in Keelung were preparing to issue a joint statement and were considering taking practical actions to protest against the United States.

More than 1,000 students and professors from the College of Law of National Taiwan University held a rally in the auditorium of National Taiwan University on the 24th to protest against the killing by American soldiers. Many law professors spoke at the meeting, denouncing the barbarous behavior of the United States. A group of students from National Taiwan University issued an open letter of protest, which stated: "We are a group of descendants of the Yellow Emperor, young people with blood and righteousness. We absolutely do not believe that when our compatriots are killed by foreigners, and we allow them to dramatically pronounce the murderer innocent in their own courts, we should remain silent. We are filled with grief and extreme indignation."

Newspaper reports said that on the 24th, many students in Taipei City went on strike to participate in the patriotic anti-American demonstrations. Thousands of angry students, shouting slogans such as "Drive out the American aggressors" and "Avenge our murdered compatriots," joined the patriotic anti-American demonstrations. Ignoring the threat of suppression by the Chiang Kai-shek group, which dispatched a large number of military police, they bravely joined the ranks of Taipei citizens who stormed and smashed the American "Embassy." Students from Chenggong High School automatically gathered at the school early in the morning of the 24th, but the school gate was closed before they could leave. Nevertheless, 54 student representatives broke through the school gate. When these students arrived at the American "Embassy" in a line, holding a sign that read "Is it permissible to kill without penalty?", they were warmly welcomed by the demonstrators. These students hung a sign reading "Protest against the American military's disregard for human rights" on the roof of the American "Embassy." Other demonstrators then hung a white cloth banner with the words "A life for a life" under this sign.

Taiwan newspapers said that many overseas Chinese students in Taiwan actively participated in the major demonstration on the 24th. When attacking the United States Information Service, a group of overseas Chinese students standing at the forefront of the demonstrators shouted: "We suffer imperialist oppression abroad, and today we still have to suffer American oppression. We cannot tolerate this!" These overseas Chinese students were the first to throw stones at the windows of the United States Information Service, tearing down the signboard and the Stars and Stripes. Then, along with other demonstrators, they rushed in and smashed this position of American cultural aggression against Taiwan.

The Taiwan "New Life Daily" said on the 26th that because students are still carrying out anti-American patriotic activities, the Chiang Kai-shek group has issued an order to all schools, instructing school authorities to "stop students from participating in mass activities" and to try to "persuade students to concentrate on their studies and not be agitated by the Liu Ziran case."

    台湾各地学生举行反美爱国集会
    据新华社香港27日电　台湾报纸报道，台湾中部和南部学生连日举行各种反美爱国集会。
    接受美国方面补助的基督教学校台中东海大学学生，24日晚举行了一个群众大会，校长曾约农在演讲中谈到美军杀人案时，流出了眼泪。25日，东海大学全体学生拒绝出席美国教授所举办的一个集会，表示对美国侵略的抗议。
    24日晚上，台中农学院学生也举行群众集会，抗议美国判决杀人犯雷诺无罪，并且通过了组织示威游行等六项决定。25日上午，台中农学院学生又再度集会商讨示威游行和向美国抗议的具体步骤，会后，农学院的学生受到蒋介石集团特务的百般威胁和恐吓。
    基隆市许多学校的学生，24日也分别集会讨论“雷诺事件”，基隆“民众日报”25日说，基隆的学生准备发表联合声明，并且酝酿采取实际行动向美国抗议。
    台湾大学法学院的学生和教授一千多人，24日在台大大礼堂举行抗议美军杀人的集会，许多法学教授都在会上发言斥责美国的野蛮行为。台湾大学一群学生发表了一封公开的抗议信，信上说：“我们是一群黄帝的子孙，是有血气，有正义的青年。我们绝对不相信，当我们的同胞被外国人杀害，而又听由他们自己以戏剧性的法庭宣判凶手无罪的时候，我们不应该讲话。我们满腹沉痛，万分愤慨。
    报纸消息说，24日台北市许多学生都自动罢课参加反美爱国大示威。成千上万愤怒的学生，高呼着“赶走美国侵略者”、“为被害同胞报仇”等口号，投入反美爱国大示威中。他们不顾蒋介石集团派出大批军警镇压的威胁，奋身投入台北市民捣毁美国“大使馆”的行列。成功中学的学生24日清早就在学校自动集合，但在出发前校门被关闭，结果仍有五十四个学生代表冲出校门，当这批学生举着“杀人无罪吗？”的标语列队到达美国“大使馆”时，受到示威群众热烈鼓掌欢迎。这些学生把一面“抗议美军藐视人权”的标语牌挂在美国“大使馆”的天台上，其他的示威群众又在这纸牌下面挂上一幅写着“杀人偿命”四字的白布标语。
    台湾报纸说，在台湾的许多华侨学生都积极参加24日的大示威，攻打美国新闻处的时候，一批站在示威群众最前列的华侨学生高呼：“我们在国外受帝国的气，今天还要受美国的气，这种气不能忍受！”这些华侨学生首先用石块掷击美国新闻处的门窗玻璃，并且把美国新闻处的招牌和星条旗扯下，接着就和其他示威群众一齐冲进去，把这座美国对台湾进行文化侵略的阵地打烂。
    26日的台湾“新生报”说，由于学生还在进行着反美爱国活动，蒋介石集团已经通令各学校，要学校当局“制止学生参加群众活动”，并且要他们设法“劝导学生安心上课，不要为刘自然案件激动”。
