Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, May 3rd: Li Jinglin, Secretary of the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and concurrently Secretary of the Huining County Committee, led cadres from Huining County to help agricultural cooperatives draw water to irrigate farmland in preparation for planting autumn crops.

In order to plant autumn crops on time, Huining County must currently vigorously irrigate autumn fields, harrow planted valleys, repair small ridges, and build field banks. The Chengguan District Agricultural Cooperative in the county seat was unable to attend to watering the fields because of a shortage of labor and livestock while still having to plough the fields. After learning about this situation, Li Jinglin immediately led twenty or so cadres, along with two head of livestock, to draw water for the Zhuangzi team of the Chengguan Cooperative to irrigate the land. On April 21, a total of 101 people and 12 head of livestock were dispatched from the County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the County People's Committee, the County Supply and Marketing Cooperative, the Bureau of Commerce, the Trading Company, and Xinhua Bookstore. With the help of the cadres, the Chengguan Cooperative irrigated 169 mu of autumn fields in six days.

Currently, cadres from various agencies in Huining County are continuing to help agricultural cooperatives with labor.

    甘肃省委书记给农业社浇地
    新华社兰州3日电　中共甘肃省委员会书记兼会宁县委书记李景林，带领会宁县干部帮助农业社提水浇地，准备种秋田。
    为了按时种秋田，会宁县目前必须大力浇秋田、耱种谷地、整修小畦和培地埂等。县城关区农业合作社，因劳力少，牲口缺，顾了犁地顾不上浇田。李景林了解了这些情况以后，马上带领二十来个干部，拉牲畜两头，给城关社庄子队提水浇地。4月21日，中共县委员会、县人民委员会、县供销社、商业局、贸易公司、新华书店等就一共出动了一百零一人和牲口十二头。在干部的帮助下，城关社用六天时间就浇了秋田一百六十九亩。
    目前，会宁县各机关的干部仍在继续帮助农业社劳动。
