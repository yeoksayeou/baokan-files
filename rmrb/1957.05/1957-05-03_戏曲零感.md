    Random Thoughts on Opera
    Xu Gan

    National Opera Festival Postponed
    One of the decisions from the repertoire work conference: The National Opera Festival, originally planned for next year, will not be held; it is uncertain whether it will be held the year after.

    This decision may disappoint some local art leaders and some troupes, and I, as an opera fan, am also a little disappointed, but the decision is correct. Because, in many places, some troupes with relatively good conditions are preoccupied with participating in the National Opera Festival, constantly refining two, three, or even just one play, neglecting others.

    Focusing on refinement and striving for perfection is very necessary, and the sincerity of believing that Beijing audiences don't like half-ripe fruit is also appreciated. However, for the sake of letting a hundred flowers bloom, continuing to explore, organize, and create new plays is equally important and cannot be neglected; the main purpose of improvement is to guide popularization, not to amaze Beijing audiences, especially since the broader audience locally cannot always eat a few rotten apples!

    50,000 Operas
    It is said that 50,000 traditional operas have already been discovered.

    Skeptics and pragmatists will find this not entirely reliable, because there may be duplicate reports from several troupes of the same opera, there must be different names for the same content, and there must be complete scripts and selected excerpts listed together. These factors can make the number 50,000 more realistic. But we cannot ignore that there are still a large number that have not been discovered. The abundance of China's dramatic heritage, I think, can be listed as one of the "world's best."

    Quantity is the foundation of quality; the more old branches, the better, if you want to see new flowers bloom on old branches. This is truly exciting. But it also makes people panic, like entering a treasure mountain in a fairy tale, where the old immortal asks you to carry as much as you can, and you don't know what to carry. Fortunately, the gate to this treasure mountain will not suddenly close. First preserve what is genuine, then organize, perform, and refine in batches.

    What I am thinking is, can we organize some forces to start writing while organizing, and then compile a large "Opera Story" collection? Without requiring it to be as exquisite as Charles and Mary Lamb's "Tales from Shakespeare," writing it concisely and succinctly, making it convenient for opera experts to research and for organizers to choose and refine, would be very meaningful.

    戏曲零感
    徐淦
    全国会演延期
    剧目工作会议决定之一：原拟在明年举行的全国戏曲会演，不举行了；后年是否举行，也不一定。
    这个决定，也许使好些地方上的艺术领导者和好些剧团感到有一点扫兴，我这个戏迷也有一点失望，但决定得很对。因为，不少地方，确有一些条件比较优越的剧团，念念不忘于参加全国会演，老在那里把三两个以至一个戏加工了又加工，不及其它。
    重点加工、精益求精是十分需要的，认为北京的观众不爱吃半生不熟的果子这点诚意也可感。不过，为了百花齐放，继续发掘、整理，和编排新戏，也同样要紧，不能偏废；提高的目的主要在指导普及，不在到北京来一鸣惊人，何况当地更广大的观众，不能老吃几只烂熟的苹果啊！
    剧目五万个
    已经发掘出来的传统剧目，据说有五万个。
    怀疑成癖的人和实事求是的人都会觉得不完全可靠，因为当中可能有同一剧种的几个剧团复报的，一定有名异实同的，也一定有整本与散折并列的。这些因素都可以使五万这个数字削减得更实在些。但是也不能疏忽，还有大批不曾发掘出来的。我国的戏剧遗产之多，我看是可以列入“世界之最”了。
    数量是质量的基础，欲见新花发故枝，故枝越多越好，真教人兴奋。但也不免教人发慌，就像进了童话中的宝山，老仙翁请你尽量地搬，不知搬什么好。好在这座宝山的洞门，不会忽然紧闭，先存其真，再分批整理、演出、加工吧。
    我想到的是，整理的同时，能不能分头组织一些力量动手写，然后集中汇编出一大部“戏曲故事”来。不要求写到像两位兰姆的“莎氏乐府本事”那么精美，写得简明扼要，便于戏曲专家的研究和整理加工者的抉择，就满有意义了。
