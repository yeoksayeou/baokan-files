Xinhua News Agency, May 25th: The United States Information Service in Saigon issued a statement on May 24th, publicly announcing its intention to establish a weather station on the Nansha Islands of China. Recently, news has spread that the U.S. military has already occupied some islands in the Nansha Islands.

The United States Information Service said that since February of this year, the United States has been "considering" establishing an American weather station in the Nansha Islands.

According to Agence France-Presse, "American sources" in Saigon revealed that the United States, the Chiang Kai-shek Group, and South Vietnam may have reached an agreement on the "issue of ownership" of China's Xisha Islands during Ngo Dinh Diem's visit to the United States. "If" the Xisha Islands are recognized as belonging to China, the "joint defense treaty" between the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek Group could be applied to "defend" these islands.

The U.S.'s illegal conspiracy to occupy China's Nansha Islands is also being carried out with the "consent" of the Chiang Kai-shek Group.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, May 25th: Leaders of democratic parties and people's organizations in Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City angrily denounced the aggressive act of the U.S. military occupying three islands in China's Nansha Islands.

Earlier, a person in charge of a Philippine merchant ship discovered that the U.S. military had occupied at least three islands in the Nansha Islands. Later, Liu Hoto, a military spokesman for the Kuomintang in Taiwan, admitted that the U.S. military's occupation of these islands had been approved in advance by the Chiang Kai-shek Group.

Lin Qiangyun, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, said, "I, on behalf of all workers in Guangdong Province, protest to the American aggressors!"

Chen Rutang, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, Guo Qiaoran, Vice Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, and Chen Qiu'an, Vice Chairman of the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, all stated that the 600 million Chinese people have the strength to defend the sacred territory and sovereignty of the motherland, and the U.S. military must immediately get out of the Nansha Islands.

Lin Donghai, the person in charge of the preparatory committee of the Guangzhou Municipal Branch of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, also pointed out that the U.S. imperialists illegally occupied Taiwan and are now occupying several islands in the Nansha Islands. These series of aggressive acts are provocations against our country and the people of Asia. He added that the Chiang Kai-shek Group's agreement to the U.S. military's occupation of the Nansha Islands is a traitorous act of leading wolves into the house and recognizing thieves as fathers. The people of Taiwan will never agree to this, and the people of the whole country will never agree to this.

Zhou Wanru, Director of the Guangdong Provincial Democratic Women's Federation, the person in charge of the Guangzhou Municipal Democratic Youth Federation, and Yi Meihou, Director of the Guangdong Provincial Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, all stated that the U.S. military must immediately withdraw from the Nansha Islands and withdraw from Taiwan. They said that the Chinese people will recover the Nansha Islands from the aggressors with the determination to liberate Taiwan.

    抗议美军侵占我国南沙群岛
    新华社25日讯　在西贡的美国新闻处5月24日发表声明，公然宣布要在中国领土南沙群岛上建立气象台。最近已经有消息传出，美国军队已经侵占了南沙群岛的一些岛屿。
    美国新闻处说，从今年2月起，美国就在“考虑”在南沙群岛上设立一个美国气象台。
    据法新社报道，西贡的“美国人士”透露，美国、蒋介石集团和南越三方面在吴庭艳访问美国期间，可能已经就中国的西沙群岛“属谁的问题”达成了协议。“假如”承认西沙群岛属于中国，就可能应用美国和蒋介石集团的“共同防御条约”来“保卫”这些岛屿。
    美国非法侵占中国南沙群岛的阴谋也是通过蒋介石集团的“同意”来进行的。
    新华社广州25日电　广东省、广州市民主党派组织和人民团体的负责人，愤怒斥责美国军队占领我国南沙群岛三个岛屿的侵略行为。
    早些时候，一个菲律宾商船负责人发现美国军队侵占了南沙群岛的至少三个岛屿。后来台湾国民党军事发言人柳鹤图承认，美国军队侵占这些岛屿曾经事先得到蒋介石集团的同意。
    广东省工会联合会主席林锵云说，“我代表广东省全体工人向美国侵略者提出抗议！”
    中国国民党革命委员会广东省委员会主任委员陈汝棠，中国民主同盟广东省委员会副主任委员郭翘然，中国民主促进会广州市委员会副主任委员陈秋安都表示，中国六亿人民有力量保卫祖国神圣的领土和主权，美国军队必须立即从南沙群岛滚出去。
    台湾民主自治同盟广州市支部筹备委员会负责人林东海也指出，美帝国主义者非法进占台湾，现在又侵占了南沙群岛几个岛屿，这一连串的侵略行为都是对我国和亚洲人民的挑衅。他又说：蒋介石集团同意美国军队侵占南沙群岛，是引狼入室认贼作父的卖国行为，台湾人民绝不答应，全国人民绝不答应。
    广东省民主妇女联合会主任周婉如，广州市民主青年联合会负责人，广东省归国华侨联合会主任蚁美厚，都表示美国军队必须立即撤出南沙群岛，撤出台湾。他们说，中国人民将以解放台湾的决心，从侵略者手中收复南沙群岛。
