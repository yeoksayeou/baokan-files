    Lanzhou is Advancing
    (Our report) The Lanzhou Oil Refinery, Lanzhou Petroleum Machinery Plant, Lanzhou Refining and Chemical Equipment Plant, Lanzhou Thermal Power Plant, and Lanzhou Water Plant, which constitute the industrial backbone of Lanzhou, are being built at an accelerated pace. These projects are all designed with the help of the Soviet Union. Most of the oil tanks at the Lanzhou Oil Refinery have been installed, and the main structure of the desalination and dehydration unit has been completed. Workers are continuing to install machinery for the thermal cracking and atmospheric and vacuum distillation units, and laying the process pipelines, which are as dense as spider webs, within the plant area. Several important projects at the Lanzhou Fertilizer Plant—the granulation tower, synthesis workshop, and comprehensive evaporation section—have started construction one after another. At the water plant site, workers have blasted and repaired a 300-meter-long pre-sedimentation basin and a 100-meter-diameter sedimentation basin on the hard rock layer. The main stonework has been completed, and slope reinforcement and slag removal are continuing. This plant will be able to start partial water supply this year. The Lanzhou Thermal Power Plant has installed one generator and one boiler, and cables to other factories are being erected. Once the overhead line project is completed, it can partially transmit electricity.
    After these large-scale factories in Lanzhou are put into production one after another, they will not only supply the people of Gansu with many daily necessities, but more importantly, they will be able to provide many means of production to all parts of the country.

    兰州在前进
    本报讯  构成兰州工业骨干的兰州炼油厂、兰州石油机械厂、兰州炼油化工设备厂、兰州热电站、兰州自来水厂等工程，正加紧建设中。这些工程都是由苏联帮助设计的。兰州炼油厂大部分油罐已装置好，脱盐脱水装置主体工程已经完工。工人们正在继续进行热裂化、常减压二个装置的机器安装工作，和厂区内密如蛛网的工艺管线敷设工作。兰州肥料厂几项重要工程——造粒塔、合成车间、综合蒸发工段等已先后开工。在自来水厂厂地上，工人们在坚硬的岩层上炸修的长达三百公尺的预沉池和直径一百公尺的沉淀池，主要石方工程已经结束，边坡加固和石渣清除在继续进行。这个厂今年将能够开始部分供水。兰州热电站已安装好一机一炉，通向别的工厂的电缆正在架设，一候架线工程完成，即可部分送电。
    兰州这些大型工厂先后投入生产后，不仅可以供应甘肃人民很多生活用品，更重要是能向全国各地提供很多生产资料。
