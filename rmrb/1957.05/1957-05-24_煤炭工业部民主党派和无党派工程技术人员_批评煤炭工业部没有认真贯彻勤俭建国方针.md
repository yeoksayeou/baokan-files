(Reported by this newspaper) The Party Group of the Ministry of Coal Industry invited members of democratic parties and non-party engineer technicians of the Ministry of Coal Industry to a discussion meeting on the 21st and 22nd. Thirteen people spoke at the meeting. They criticized the shortcomings of the Ministry of Coal Industry in implementing the policy of building the country through thrift and hard work, as well as bureaucracy.

Guan Rongshu said: The Ministry of Coal Industry is like a "nouveau riche," spending money casually without any concern.

Engineer Yang Lisheng said: In the past, the Ministry of Coal Industry had the idea of ​​being greedy for more and seeking great things, only paying attention to the construction of large mines, and neglecting small mines. In 1952, it also closed many small coal kilns, which made the contradiction of supply falling short of demand for coal even more acute. He believes that we should proceed from China's specific conditions, build more small mines, and restore old mines to alleviate the current and future tight coal supply. He said, I very much agree with the opinions of Soviet experts that more small open-pit coal mines should be opened. With an investment of only hundreds of thousands of yuan, a small machine, a few vehicles, and dozens of people, coal can be produced in a year and a half. More coal should be mined if possible, and less coal should be mined if necessary, and then leave when it is done.

Engineer Guan Rongshu described the Ministry of Coal Industry as a "nouveau riche," spending money casually without any concern, and indifferent to production, costs, and efficiency. He said: When building coal preparation plants, they always go for a scale of 1.5 million tons or 2 million tons, completely ignoring the fact that our country is large and has a low level of technology. Non-productive buildings are too large: in the past, three ministries used a three-story building, but now one ministry uses a five-story building; what the higher levels do, the lower levels follow, and the situation in the mining bureaus is similar. In the basic construction teams, non-production personnel account for 39%, which is a great waste.

Yang Lisheng said: Research strength should be dispersed first and then concentrated

Engineer Yang Lisheng criticized the Coal Research Institute. He said that at present, with the low technical level of coal mines and the lack of talent, it is not in line with China's actual situation to concentrate many experienced engineers and technicians from all over the country to carry out academic research. In particular, the Research Institute sends a group of inexperienced college graduates to the grassroots level to do experiments, but because they cannot see what the problem is, there is no way to experiment. Therefore, he advocated "dispersion first, then concentration," that is, sending existing engineers, technicians, and college students to the mines, determining different topics according to the specific conditions of each mine, and combining with practice for research. This is beneficial to solving the problems currently encountered in coal mine construction and production.

Mai Fengchu said: Mutual protection between higher and lower levels promotes bureaucracy

Mai Fengchu, deputy director of the China Democratic League Coal Ministry branch and engineer, said: There is serious sectarianism and bureaucracy in the leadership of the Datong Mining Bureau, which is the root cause of their failure to complete their tasks. Minister Chen Yu once personally went to inspect, but when he found problems, he did not conduct public criticism, but quietly replaced a few cadres. Why not conduct public criticism? This is because many problems involve the ministry, so in fact they are protecting each other, which objectively promotes bureaucracy.

Chen Yingliang said: Not following the mass line, putting the opinions of the masses aside

Engineers Chen Yingliang and Tang Zizhen criticized the Ministry of Coal Industry for not seriously implementing the mass line. Chen Yingliang took the formulation of safety regulations as an example, saying that from the trial implementation in 1951 to 1953, tens of thousands of opinions were solicited, and many on-site engineers were gathered to study, but the ministry put these people's opinions aside, copied many foreign clauses, and issued them by order of the minister. As a result, some clauses were not practical and self-contradictory, and there were many opinions from below and inconsistent understanding. The explanations given by the various deputy ministers, assistant ministers, and directors of the ministry were also extremely inconsistent, causing ideological confusion among the on-site executors.

Tang Zizhen said: The responsibility of the leadership lies in relying on the masses, trusting the masses, and solving the problems raised by the lower levels in a timely manner. However, when the lower levels raise problems, the ministry often only answers "no way" on the phone. He said that the power of the masses is infinite, but it must be concentrated by the leadership.

    煤炭工业部民主党派和无党派工程技术人员
    批评煤炭工业部没有认真贯彻勤俭建国方针
    本报讯　煤炭工业部党组于21、22日邀请煤炭工业部民主党派会员和无党派工程技术人员座谈。会上发言的有十三人。他们对煤炭工业部在贯彻勤俭建国方针上的缺点以及官僚主义等提出了批评。
    关荣枢说：煤炭部像个“暴发户”，随便花钱不心痛
    杨力生工程师说：过去煤炭工业部有贪多图大的思想，只注意建设大井，忽视小井，1952年还封闭了许多小煤窑，结果使煤炭供不应求的矛盾更加尖锐起来。他认为应该从中国具体情况出发，多建一些小井，恢复旧有矿井，以缓和目前和今后煤炭供应紧张的情况。他说，我很同意苏联专家的意见，多开一些小露天煤矿，只要投资几十万元，一部小机器，几辆车，几十个人，用一年半载的时间就可出煤，煤多多搞，煤少少搞，搞完了就走。
    关荣枢工程师形容煤炭工业部像个“暴发户”，随便花钱不心痛，对生产、成本、效率漠然。他说：搞选煤厂，一搞就是一百五十万吨、两百万吨规模的，全不想想我们国家大、技术水平落后的情况。非生产性建筑过大：过去三个部用一座三层大楼，现在一个部用一座五层大楼；上行下效，矿务局的情况也差不多。在基本建设施工队伍中，非生产人员所占比例达到39％，浪费很大。
    杨力生说：研究力量应先分散后集中
    杨力生工程师对煤炭研究院提出了批评。他说，目前在煤矿的技术水平低，人才缺乏的情况下，集中全国许多有经验的工程技术人员进行学院式的研究，是不符合中国实际情况的。特别是研究院派一批没有经验的大学毕业生到下边去做实验，因为他们看不出什么问题，所以也没有办法实验。因此，他主张“先分散，后集中”，即把现有工程技术人员和大学生派到矿上去，根据每个矿的具体情况确定不同的题目，结合实际进行研究。这对解决当前煤矿建设和生产遇到的问题是有好处的。
    麦凤初说：上下互相包庇，助长官僚主义
    民盟煤炭部支委会副主任委员、工程师麦凤初说：大同矿务局领导上存在着严重的宗派主义和官僚主义，这是他们没有完成任务的根本原因。陈郁部长曾经亲自去检查，但发现了问题却没有进行公开的批评，只是不声不响地撤换了少数干部。为什么不进行公开批评呢？这是因为有很多问题牵连到部里，所以，实际上是互相包庇，客观上助长了官僚主义。
    陈英亮说：不走群众路线，把群众的意见放在一边
    陈英亮和汤子珍工程师对煤炭工业部没有认真贯彻群众路线提出了批评。陈英亮以制定保安规程为例，说从1951年试行到1953年，共征求数万条意见，并集中许多现场工程师研究，但是，部里却把这些人的意见放在一边，抄了许多国外的条文，以部长的命令下达。结果，有些条文不切合实际，自相矛盾，下边意见很大，理解也不一致，部里各副部长、部长助理和司局长说的解释也极不一致，造成现场执行人员的思想混乱。
    汤子珍说：领导的责任在于依靠群众，信任群众，及时解决下边提出的问题。可是当下面提出问题的时候，部里往往在电话只回答“没办法”三个字。他说，群众的力量是无穷的，但要依靠领导去集中。
