Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 15th: A Soviet-Mongolian People's Friendship Rally was held in the Grand Kremlin Palace today. Tsedenbal, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Mongolian People's Republic, and Bulganin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, spoke at the rally.

Tsedenbal pointed out in his speech that the Mongolian people owe the fruits of their freedom and national independence, as well as all the achievements they have made in consolidating national independence and ensuring the socialist development of the Mongolian People's Republic, to the Soviet people's generous and selfless brotherly assistance.

Tsedenbal emphasized that no force can separate the Mongolian people from the only correct path pointed out by Lenin.

Tsedenbal then spoke about the necessity of constantly strengthening the solidarity of socialist countries. He said that this is of particular significance in the current international situation, and it is the law of the present era—the era of the destruction of capitalism and the victory of communism.

Tsedenbal finally pointed out that this visit and the talks are of great significance for further strengthening the friendship between the Soviet and Mongolian peoples, for further rapidly developing the economy and culture of the Mongolian People's Republic, and for helping to strengthen the cause of the great socialist camp.

In his speech, Bulganin said that the government delegations of the Soviet Union and Mongolia discussed some of the most important issues in the current international situation during the talks, and both sides' assessment of the current situation was completely consistent.

Bulganin spoke about the Soviet Union's efforts to ease international tensions. He pointed out that the Soviet Union had recently written to the governments of many European countries, and he went on to say that although the replies received from some Western European countries were not the appropriate response to the issues raised by the Soviet Union, and these replies in many ways did not conform to the interests of peace-loving people, we believe that life itself will push the governments of Western European countries onto the path of realistic policies.

Speaking about the situation in the Middle East, Bulganin said that the Dulles-Eisenhower Doctrine is now the main source of instability in the region. The Soviet Union's only concern in the Middle East and all other parts of the world is to safeguard and strengthen peace and to ensure that all nations have the right to decide their own destiny.

When talking about the issue of disarmament and the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons, Bulganin said that the continuous testing of nuclear weapons naturally causes increasing anxiety and concern among the people of all countries. National parliaments, especially the parliaments of the United States and Britain, can make a great contribution to resolving the most important issues of the present.

Bulganin pointed out that personal contact between national leaders is of great significance and has brought benefits in the past. Now that some signs of easing international tensions have reappeared, this creates a favorable environment for resuming such contact. The leaders of Eastern and Western countries have things to talk about, and of course, such meetings must be properly prepared.

Bulganin stated that the Soviet Union has always supported the right of the Mongolian People's Republic to enjoy its legitimate status in the United Nations. The government of the Mongolian People's Republic pursues an independent foreign policy of friendly cooperation with all nations and constantly makes its own contributions to strengthening peace in the Far East and the world.

Bulganin said that the Mongolian government delegation gave a positive evaluation of the restoration of normal relations between the Soviet Union and Japan, and also hoped for the normalization of Mongolian-Japanese relations. The Soviet Union fully supports this desire of the government of the Mongolian People's Republic, believing that this will greatly help to establish an atmosphere of mutual trust in the Far East.

    莫斯科举行苏蒙人民友好大会
    泽登巴尔说蒙苏会谈有助于加强社会主义阵营事业
    布尔加宁赞扬蒙古在加强远东和平方面作出的贡献
    据新华社15日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科15日讯：今天在大克里姆林宫举行了苏蒙人民友好大会。蒙古人民共和国部长会议主席泽登巴尔和苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁在会上讲了话。
    泽登巴尔的讲话指出，蒙古人民把自己所获得的自由和民族独立的成果，以及在巩固国家独立和保证蒙古人民共和国向社会主义发展的事业中所获得的一切成就，归功于苏联人民的慷慨无私的兄弟援助。
    泽登巴尔强调指出，任何力量都不能使蒙古人民脱离列宁所指出的唯一正确的道路。
    泽登巴尔接着谈到了经常加强社会主义国家团结一致的必要性。他说，这在目前国际局势中具有特殊的意义，这是现时代——资本主义毁灭和共产主义胜利的时代——的规律。
    泽登巴尔最后指出，这次访问和会谈对于进一步加强苏蒙两国人民的友谊，对于进一步迅速发展蒙古人民共和国的经济和文化，有着巨大的意义，并且有助于加强伟大社会主义阵营的事业。布尔加宁在讲话中说，苏蒙两国政府代表团在会谈中讨论了当前国际局势中一些最重要的问题，双方对当前局势的估计是完全一致的。
    布尔加宁谈到了苏联在缓和国际紧张局势方面所作的努力。他指出，苏联最近曾经写信给许多欧洲国家的政府，他接着说，虽然我们所接到的某些西欧国家的答复不是对苏联所提问题的应有的反应，这些答复在许多方面不符合爱好和平人民的利益，然而我们认为，生活本身将推动西欧各国政府走上现实政策的道路。
    在谈到中近东局势的时候，布尔加宁说，杜勒斯—艾森豪威尔主义现在是这一地区的局势动荡不安的主要根源。苏联在中近东和世界其他一切地区所唯一关心的是维护和加强和平，使各国人民有自己决定自己命运的权利。
    布尔加宁在谈到裁军和禁止原子武器、氢武器的问题时说，不断进行核武器试验自然地引起各国人民越来越大的不安和忧虑。各国议会，首先是美英两国议会，可以在解决目前最重要的问题方面作出巨大贡献。
    布尔加宁指出，国家领导人的个人接触有着巨大的意义，这种接触过去曾经带来了好处。现在国际紧张局势又出现了某些缓和的征象，这为恢复这种接触创造了良好的环境。东西方国家的领导人是有事情可以谈的，当然，这种会见必须是经过适当准备的。
    布尔加宁表示，苏联一向支持蒙古人民共和国在联合国中享有合法地位的权利。蒙古人民共和国政府奉行着各国人民友好合作的独立外交政策，在加强远东和世界和平方面不断地作出自己的贡献。
    布尔加宁说，蒙古政府代表团对于苏联和日本恢复正常关系作了肯定的评价，并且也希望蒙日关系正常化。苏联完全支持蒙古人民共和国政府的这种愿望，认为这将大大有助于在远东建立互相信任的气氛。
