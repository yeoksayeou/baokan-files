    Three Kinds of Rubber Plants Discovered in Fujian
    Fujian Province has recently discovered a variety of rubber plants with excellent rubber content. A vine rubber was found in the tropical forest of Nanxing Township, Minnan. This plant clings to or wraps around tall trees of thirty to forty meters in height, with about four to six hundred plants per hectare. The extracted rubber can be used as raw material for high-grade rubber products. A kind of tree locally called the Ningli tree was found in the miscellaneous woods of barren hills and remnants in Yunxiao County. Each tree can be tapped for six to ten kilograms of rubber, which can be used as raw material for hard rubber products. A kind of tree locally called "Planting Tree" or "? Rubber Sticky" tree was found in Taining and other places in northern Fujian. After scraping off the outer cork layer, it is crushed in a stone mortar, immersed in a stream and washed to obtain a very sticky gelatinous substance. Sparrows flying in the sky and rats crawling on the ground will be stuck firmly and will never escape if they touch it. (Song Gui)

    衢州兴建肥料厂
    一座年产七万吨石灰氮肥的化学肥料工厂，将在浙江省衢州地区兴建。第一期工程可在今年动工。
    包头建立大热电站
    包头市新兴工业区正在建设一座规模巨大的高温高压热电站。它投入生产后，包头市的发电能力将比现在增大四倍多。它还可以输送出大量高压蒸气，供给附近工厂的需要。
    福建发现三种橡胶植物
    福建省最近又发现了多种含胶质量优异的橡胶植物。在闽南南靖县和溪乡的热带林里发现一种藤本橡胶。这种植物攀附或缠在三、四十公尺高大的乔木上，每公顷约有四百至六百二十几株，提炼出的橡胶可供高级胶制品原料用。在云霄县荒山残林的杂木林中，发现的一种土名叫柠栵树，每株可割胶六至十斤，可做硬质胶品原料。在闽北泰宁等地发现一种土名叫“植树”或“?胶粘”树，将皮刮去外部木栓质然后放入石臼中捣碎，浸在溪流中冲洗即得粘性极强的胶质，天上飞的麻雀，地下爬的老鼠只要碰上愈粘愈牢、永难逃脱。（宋桂）
