Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhou Zemin reports: The General Political Department Propaganda Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army recently convened nearly forty military writers, musicians, artists, literary and art workers, and cultural work leaders in Beijing for a symposium to discuss how to further implement the "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" policy in the military.

The Whole Army Has Not Yet "Bloomed" and "Contended" Extensively
Many of those present believed that after the "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" policy was put forward, although some felt like they were in a garden full of spring colors, the general situation was that various restrictions and obstacles still existed in tangible and intangible ways, and the whole army had not yet "bloomed" and "contended" extensively.

Some people believe that the attitude of the leadership in military cultural work towards implementing the "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" policy is not firm enough, and the words and deeds of some cultural work leaders even violate the spirit of the Central Committee's policy. Zhang Wenyuan, leader of the editorial group of the People's Liberation Army Literature and Art Publishing House, said that in the early stages of the introduction of this policy, I felt that the door was not open and there was full of vigilance. At one symposium, some people put forward some opinions that were inconsistent with the leadership, and certain cultural department leaders immediately stood up to speak, telling everyone not to casually contend, saying that contention was to eliminate idealism, and that communists could not promote idealism, etc. Later, when various places had begun to contend, some cultural department leaders paid special attention to those one-sided materials, and at the meeting mobilized everyone to say that there were many rightist things outside now, and everyone should pick up their pens and join the battle. This kind of "leftist" anti-rightist action is actually a dogmatic and one-sided view. Writer Du Feng said that it was strange that after the Central Committee's policy was conveyed, individual leading comrades in the cultural department openly declared at the meeting: "The military is not allowed to let a hundred schools of thought contend!" Some also said that the military "is only allowed to release fragrant flowers, not poisonous weeds!" What is the reason? There was no follow-up. I believe that not only should it be allowed, but it should be resolutely, quickly, and thoroughly implemented. Only through "contention" and "blooming" can fragrant flowers and poisonous weeds be distinguished. Dogmatism, which was regarded as a fragrant flower in the past, was only seen through after contention, and it turned out to be a poisonous weed. Writer Wei Wei believes that who is hindering "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend"? It is a part of the "leftist" ideological sentiment within the Party.

The Dogmatism and Sectarian Sentiments of the Leadership
Restricting Creation to a Narrow Circle

Writers exposed the dogmatism and sectarian sentiments in the leadership of creation from the aspects of guiding ideology of creation and editing and publishing. Many people believe that some of the policies and slogans put forward in the past regarding literary and art work, although they had a positive effect in a certain period, also had the shortcomings of being relatively mechanical and absolute. One of its manifestations is that in guiding creation, it requires depicting major themes, combining current tasks, and creating heroic images. Although the proposal of these issues did play a positive role in opposing formulistic creation such as "backward to transformation," due to the one-sidedness and simplification of the wording, major themes and the diversification of themes, modern themes and historical themes, heroic figures and backward figures were placed in an opposing position invisibly, ignoring the contradictions and conflicts in life and the characteristics of literature and art, restricting creation to a narrow circle. This has bound the writers' thinking, making them afraid to face the reality of life, afraid to boldly expose and criticize the backward phenomena and backward figures in life, afraid to write about contradictions, conflicts, and shortcomings, and even beautifying and embellishing life, creating conditions for formularization and conceptualization. Wei Wei said that there is no contradiction between the theory of broad themes and the direction of workers, peasants, and soldiers, or between major themes and love affairs and family matters. In fact, literary and artistic works throughout history have not only had major themes, but also written about love affairs and family matters. Writer Zhou Jiefu said that the past practice of the cultural department leadership putting forward the idea that it must help writers clarify the theme idea like directing a battle to help clarify the main attack direction, and then collect materials for writing, violates the laws of creation. In fact, the theme of a work is conceived in life. The practice of clarifying the theme first and then going to life is precisely related to formularization and conceptualization.

Writer Yu Ji criticized the practice that all works written about the army must be reviewed by the military before they can be published, and that some comrades in the editing department crudely delete and modify a lot without consulting the writer, even tens of thousands of words. Some people also criticized that some reviewers often do not base their judgment on how life itself is, but on how life should be, instructing the author not to write that way, but to write this way. Writer Han Xiliang also suggested that the editorial department of the People's Liberation Army Literature and Art Series should not hold the gate, saying that all books related to the military should be published by me. There should be competition to break the monopoly.

Dogmatic Literary and Art Criticism
Hindered the Prosperity of Creation

The influence of dogmatic literary and art criticism is also very far-reaching. Chen Feiqin of the "People's Liberation Army Literature and Art" editorial department criticized this issue. He said that what is more serious for us is dogmatic criticism, which is criticism that is divorced from reality and simply uses theories from books to explain literary and artistic issues. For example, Bai Ren's "Target Straight Ahead," because it reflected the feeling of pride in one's merits after victory, the critic added the label of anti-proletarian leadership. In Hu Ke's script, he wrote about a commander giving up family happiness to resist US aggression and aid Korea. The critic said that this is a noble moral quality that ordinary soldiers have, and the work's depiction of the commander in this way lowers the excellent qualities of our military commanders and fighters. Lu Yi, editor of "People's Liberation Army Literature and Art," believes that comrades engaged in commentary leadership work only proceed abstractly from the perspective of political work when writing commentaries, and do not proceed from reality. They believe that everything in the army is right, good, and correct, saying that writing about backward people is because of the author's own dark side. Some people said that if this is the case, the army can only be a model, with only the front and rear rows, and no distinction between advanced and backward. Lu Yi said that subjective conjecture and dogmatism in criticism work are the most harmful to authors and hinder the prosperity of creation.

Simple and Rigid Leadership Methods, Overly Imperious Commands and Interference

At the meeting, many people's speeches also believed that although the leaders at all levels of the military are concerned about literary and art work, the leadership methods are relatively simple and rigid, and there is too much imperious command and interference, which cannot be led according to the characteristics of literature and art. Composer Xiao He said that literary and art work is complex, and if it is not led according to its characteristics, it will hinder its "blooming." For example, it is very good to emphasize the national style for the band of the cultural troupe. But it should not fail to absorb foreign things, and overemphasizing the national style has made some people who have been playing the violin for seven or eight years put down the violin, which is too simplistic. For example, the cultural troupe is reorganized every year, with few people and many things. The Navy Cultural Troupe performed more than 300 shows last year and wanted to rest and go down to life, but the leadership did not agree. Without organizational guarantees, they cannot get study and improvement, and good flowers cannot bloom. He hopes that the leadership can absorb comrades from the cultural troupe to study the reorganization issues together.

We Must Love Flowers and Plant Flowers, Not Pull Them Out

The lack of attention to art work is a common feeling of painters Ai Yan and Liu Lun. Since 1949, the military has reorganized more than 400 art workers. At present, there are no art personnel establishments in the military, and some people have to hang the name of an assistant of the military court to engage in art work. Liu Lun said that I am a university lecturer, and I came to the army with the purpose of transforming myself. I have been groping for the past five or six years and have gradually felt the emotions of soldiers, which is not easy. The leadership should cherish us very much, love flowers and plant flowers, and not pull them out. It is necessary to solve the establishment of painters, organize the publication of painters' works, and ensure the prosperity of military art creation.

Leadership Must Be Conducted According to the Characteristics of Literature and Art

Chen Yi believes that two problems must be solved in military cultural work: first, leaders at all levels of the military must treat literary and art work as image thinking work; second, leadership must be conducted according to the characteristics of literature and art.

Chen Yi said, I believe that in recent years, military creation has been prosperous. The leadership has supported and supported creation. But there are shortcomings in our work, such as in the guiding ideology of creation, advocating writing about new heroic figures, ignoring the expression of contradictions and conflicts in life in literary and artistic works; in the construction of cultural troupes, some have lost sight of the other, that is, they have taken care of song and dance, but lost sight of drama, especially opera.

This meeting has been going on intermittently for three and a half days, and will also be divided into group discussions. People at the meeting spoke more actively.

### 部队中不能开展百家争鸣吗？  部队文艺工作者批评部队文化部门领导上的教条主义

    部队中不能开展百家争鸣吗？
    部队文艺工作者批评部队文化部门领导上的教条主义
    本报讯　新华社记者周泽民报道：中国人民解放军总政治部宣传部最近召集在北京的近四十位部队作家、音乐、美术、文艺工作者和文化工作领导人员等，举行座谈会，讨论在部队中如何进一步贯彻“百花齐放、百家争鸣”方针的问题。
    全军还没有大“放”大“鸣”
    到会的许多人都认为，在“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针提出以后，有人虽有满园春色之感，但总的情况是有形无形地还存在着种种束缚和障碍，全军还没有大“放”、大“鸣”起来。
    有人认为部队文化工作领导上对贯彻“百花齐放、百家争鸣”方针的态度，不够坚决，有些文化工作领导者的言行，甚至和中央的这一方针的精神相违背。解放军文艺社编辑组长张文苑说，在这个方针提出的初期，我感到是门户未开，戒心十足。在一次座谈会上，有人提出了些和领导上不一致的意见，某些文化部门领导者就马上起来讲话，要大家不要随便争鸣，说争鸣是为了消除唯心主义，共产党员总不能宣传唯心主义啦等等。后来，当各地已开始争鸣起来，某些文化部门领导者又特别注视那些偏向性的材料，并且在会议上动员大家说，现在外面右的东西很多，大家应该拿起笔来，投入战斗。这种以“左”反右的行动，实际上，是一种教条主义的片面的看法。作家杜烽说，奇怪的是，在中央这一方针传达后，文化部门竟然有个别领导同志，在会议上公然宣称：“部队里不准百家争鸣！”也有人说，部队里“只准放香花、不准放毒草！”理由何在？没有下文。我认为，不但应该准，而且应该坚决、迅速、彻底地把这方针贯彻下去。只有经过“鸣”和“放”，才能鉴别香花和毒草。教条主义在过去被当作香花的，只是在争鸣之后，才被看破，原来是一棵毒草。作家魏巍认为，究竟谁在阻碍“百花齐放、百家争鸣”呢？那就是党内一部分“左”倾思想情绪。
    领导的教条主义和宗派情绪
    把创作限制在狭小圈子里
    作家们从创作的指导思想和编审出版等方面，揭露了创作领导上的教条主义和宗派情绪。许多人认为，过去提出的关于文艺工作的一些方针、口号，尽管在一定时期，有过它的积极作用，但也存在着比较机械和绝对的缺点。它的表现之一，是在指导创作上，要求描写重大题材，结合当前任务，创造英雄形象。这些问题的提出，虽然在反对“落后到转变”等公式主义创作上，确曾起过一些积极作用。但是，由于提法上的片面性和简单化，无形中把重大题材和题材的多样化、现代题材和历史题材，英雄人物和落后人物，摆在对立的地位，忽视了生活中的矛盾、冲突和文艺的特征，把创作限制在一个狭小的圈子里。这就束缚了作家的思想，使他们不敢面对生活的真实，不敢大胆揭露和抨击生活中的落后现象和落后人物，不敢写矛盾、冲突和缺点，甚至美化和粉饰生活，为公式化、概念化造成条件。魏巍说，题材广泛论与工农兵方向，重大题材与儿女情、家务事，并没有什么矛盾。事实上，历来的文艺作品，并不是光有重大题材，而不写儿女情、家务事的。作家周洁夫说，过去文化部门领导上提出，必须像指挥打仗帮助搞清主攻方向一样，帮助作家明确主题思想，然后再去收集材料写作的作法，是违反创作规律的。事实上，作品主题是在生活中孕育起来的。先明确主题再去生活的作法，恰恰和公式化、概念化有一定的关系。
    作家虞棘对凡写军队的作品必须经部队审查后才能发表的作法，对编辑部门某些同志不跟作家商量便粗暴地大删大改，甚至一改就是几万字，提出了批评。也有人批评了某些审稿者往往不是以生活本身如何作依据，而是以生活应该如何作依据，责成作者不要那样写，应该这样写。作家韩希梁还建议解放军文艺丛书编辑部不要把住关口，说凡是有关军队的书由我出。应该竞争，打破垄断。
    教条主义的文艺批评
    阻碍了创作的繁荣
    教条主义的文艺批评的影响也是很深远的。“解放军文艺”编辑部陈斐琴对这个问题提出了批评。他说，我们较为严重的是教条主义的批评，是脱离实际、简单地用书本上的理论来解释文艺问题的批评。如白刃的“目标正前方”，因为反映了胜利后的居功骄傲情绪，批评家就给加上反无产阶级领导的帽子。胡可在剧本中写了一个指挥员放弃家庭幸福去抗美援朝。批评家就说，这是一个普通战士都有的崇高道德品质，作品这样描写指挥员，降低了我军指战员的优秀品质。“解放军文艺”编辑鲁一认为，搞评论领导工作的同志，在写评论时，只是抽象地从政治工作角度出发，不从实际出发。他们认为部队什么都是对的，好的，正确的，说写落后的人是因为作者本身的阴暗面。有人说，如此说来，部队就只能是一个模型，只有排头排尾之分，而无先进落后区别了。鲁一说，批评工作中的主观臆断，教条主义，是最伤害作者而阻碍创作的繁荣的。
    领导方法简单生硬压服式的命令干涉过多
    会上，许多人的发言还认为，部队各级领导对文艺工作尽管是关怀的，但是，领导方法比较简单、生硬，我说你听压服式的命令干涉过多，不能按照文艺特点进行领导。作曲家晓河说，文艺工作是复杂的，如果不按其特性进行领导，那就会妨碍它“放”。比如关于文工团的乐队，强调民族风格很好。但也不应该不吸取外国的东西，过分强调民族风格，使一些拉了七、八年小提琴的人，放下小提琴，这就太简单化了。又如文工团年年整编，人少事繁。海军文工团去年演出了三百多场，希望休整一下，下去生活一下，领导也不同意。没有组织保证，也得不到学习提高，是放不出好花来的。他希望领导上能吸收文工团同志一起，研究整编问题。
    要爱花种花不要拔花
    美术工作的不被重视，是画家艾炎和刘仑共同的感觉。1949年以来，部队整编掉了四百多个美术工作者，目前部队里没有美工人员的编制，有人只好挂个军事法院助理员的名，从事美术工作。刘仑说，我是一个大学讲师，抱着改造自己的目的来到部队。我五、六年来多少摸索到点兵的感情，很不容易。领导上应该很好地珍惜我们，要爱花、种花，不要拔掉花。要解决画家的编制、组织画家作品的出版，保证军事美术创作的繁荣。
    必须按文艺特点进行领导
    陈沂认为在部队文化工作上，必须解决两个问题，一是军队各级领导必须把文艺工作作为形象思维的工作对待；一是必须按文艺特点进行领导。
    陈沂说，我认为，这些年来，部队创作是繁荣的。领导对创作是扶植、支持的。但在我们工作中是有缺点的，如在创作指导思想上，提倡写新英雄人物，忽略了文艺作品表现生活中的矛盾、冲突；在文工团建设上，有些顾此失彼，即顾了歌舞，失了话剧，特别是歌剧。
    这个会议已经断续开了三天半，还将分组进行专题讨论。会上人们发言比较踊跃。
