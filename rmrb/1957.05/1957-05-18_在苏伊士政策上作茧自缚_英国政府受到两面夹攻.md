Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The British Labour Party, the opposition party, has sharply criticized the government's entire Suez policy, which began with a "mad war" and ended with a capitulation. Labour leader Gaitskell stated in the House of Commons on the 15th that the Conservative government allowed British ships to pass through the Suez Canal because it had no other choice but to admit defeat and swallow its pride. Gaitskell put forward an impeachment motion accusing the government's policy of causing losses to Britain.

Gaitskell called for negotiations with the Soviet Union to help resolve the Middle East issue. He believed that the US's attempt to "split other Arab countries from Egypt" could not solve the "fundamental problems" of the Middle East.

Some "imperialist" Conservative MPs expressed great dissatisfaction with the government's agreement to use the canal. They condemned it as "surrender".

The British House of Commons voted on the evening of the 16th on the Labour Party's impeachment motion against the government's Suez policy. The motion was defeated by 308 votes to 259. However, sixteen Conservative MPs abstained from voting. This reduced the government's majority from the usual sixty or so to forty-nine. This was the smallest majority that Macmillan has received since becoming Prime Minister. Before and during the voting process, Conservative supervisors made tremendous efforts to ensure the government's majority. It is said that they even mobilized some Conservative MPs to come from hospitals to vote.

Viscount Hinchingbrooke, the leader of the eight MPs who openly defected to become independent Conservatives, delivered an angry speech. Referring to the "Suez disaster," he said that "the consequences of the military action were very bad" and that the subsequent diplomacy was a "complete failure."

Bevan, summing up the debate for the Labour Party, said that the government's action of waging war against Egypt in the face of Bulganin's warning was a "criminal, reckless, and extremely stupid act." He said that Eden's resignation could not "wash away" the "sins" of the current government. Addressing the government ministers, he said, "If they have any sense of shame, they will resign and make way."

Macmillan, in his final speech in the debate, had to admit, "It would be foolish to deny that we suffered a setback." But he also said, "It would be equally foolish to exaggerate this point, especially at home and abroad."

The London press widely speculated that Lloyd might soon resign as Foreign Secretary as another scapegoat for the Suez adventure.

### 在苏伊士政策上作茧自缚  英国政府受到两面夹攻

    在苏伊士政策上作茧自缚
    英国政府受到两面夹攻
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：英国反对党工党对政府以发动“疯狂战争”开始而以屈膝投降告终的整个苏伊士政策提出了尖锐的批评。工党领袖盖次克尔15日在下院说：保守党政府允许英国的船只通过苏伊士运河，是因为除知难而退和忍气吞声之外别无办法。盖次克尔提出了一项弹劾案，指责政府的政策使英国遭到了损失。
    盖次克尔要求同苏联谈判，以便协助解决中东问题。他认为，美国“竭力使其他阿拉伯国家同埃及分裂”的作法绝不能解决中东的“基本问题”。
    一些“帝国派”的保守党议员对政府同意使用运河表示了很大的不满。他们谴责这是“投降”。
    英国下院16日晚间就工党反对政府的苏伊士政策弹劾案进行表决，弹劾案以三百零八票对二百五十九票被击败。但是，有十六名保守党议员在表决中弃权。这使得政府的多数票从通常大约六十票下降到了四十九票。这是麦克米伦出任首相以来所得到的最少的一次多数票。在投票以前和投票进行的过程中，保守党的督导员作了巨大的努力来保证政府多数。据说，他们甚至动员了某些保守党议员从医院里出来投票。
    公开叛变而成为独立保守党人的八个议员的领袖欣琴布鲁克子爵发表了愤怒演说。他在谈到“苏伊士灾难”的时候说，“军事行动的后果非常之坏”，而随后的外交又 “完全失败”。
    比万在为工党总结这次辩论时说，政府在面临着布尔加宁的警告的情况下同埃及进行战争的行动是 “犯罪的、轻率的、极为愚蠢的行为”。他说，艾登的辞职并不能“洗掉”现任政府的“罪过”。他针对政府大臣们说，“如果他们还有任何羞耻之心那么他们就会辞职，让位。”
    麦克米伦在辩论最后发言中也不得不承认，“如果否认我们遭到挫折，那是愚蠢。”但是他又说，“在国内尤其是在国外，要夸大这一点也同样是愚蠢的。”
    伦敦的报界盛传，劳埃德不久可能要辞掉外交大臣的职务，作为苏伊士冒险的另外一头替罪羊。
