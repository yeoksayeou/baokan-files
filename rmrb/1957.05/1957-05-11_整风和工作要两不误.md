Rectification and Work Must Not Be Neglected
          By a Commentator of this Newspaper

    The main targets of this rectification campaign are the leading cadres of the various departments and regions. These cadres are very busy with their work, and they are often required to solve many problems in the work of the Party and the state. If rectification is not carried out because of the need to solve these problems, then the problems themselves cannot be correctly solved. If work is affected because of the rectification, it may expand the original contradictions. Therefore, the Central Committee, in its instructions on rectification, put forward the principle of not neglecting either work or rectification.

    At present, some institutions are not handling this issue properly, and there are situations where they only focus on rectification and neglect work. The Party Committee of the state organs stipulates two or three afternoons per week, but some organs stipulate three days or five afternoons per week for study. Using so much time for rectification will in fact affect work. In some organs, work completely stops during study time. The phone is not answered, and there is no key cadre on duty in the entire organ. As a result, if the higher authorities have something to ask, if the same level has something to discuss, or if the lower level has something to request instructions on, they all have to wait for another day. What does it mean to affect work because of rectification? This is one such situation.

    This phenomenon should be prevented. Since we want to ensure that neither work nor rectification is neglected, we cannot demand that the rectification movement be completed in a very short period of time. We must lengthen the duration of the rectification movement, which will benefit both work and rectification. At the same time, during the time allotted for rectification study, each department must have responsible cadres on duty to ensure that work is not interrupted under any circumstances.

    整风和工作要两不误
          本报评论员
    这次整风的主要对象是各个部门、各个地区党的主要干部，这些干部的工作都很忙，党和国家工作中有很多问题经常要他们解决。如果因为解决这些问题而不进行整风，那这些问题本身也就不能得到正确的解决；如果因为整风而影响了工作，那就可能使原有的矛盾扩大。所以，中央在关于整风的指示当中，提出了工作、整风两不误的原则。
    现在，有些机关对这个问题的处理并不恰当，只顾整风，不顾工作的情形是存在的。国家机关党委规定每周两三个下午，但是有的机关规定每周学习三天，或者学习五个下午。用这么多的时间来整风，事实上是要影响工作的。有的机关每到学习时间，工作完全停顿下来，电话也不接，整个机关没有一个主要干部值班。结果，上级有什么事询问，同级有什么事商量，下级有什么事请示，一律要等待来日。什么叫做因为整风影响了工作呢？这就是其中的一种情形。
    这种现象应当防止。既然要工作、整风两不误，就不能要求在很短很短的时间当中结束整风运动，就必须把整风运动的时间放长一些，这对工作、对整风都有好处。同时，在进行整风学习的时间内，各部门一定要有负责干部值班，保证在任何情况下，不致使工作中断。
