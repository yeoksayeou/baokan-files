This policy needs to exist for a long time
Pan Shu

Regarding the question of letting go or tightening up, there is no doubt that Chairman Mao's instruction to let go and not be afraid is completely correct. The current "Hundred Flowers Blooming" is just budding, and the current "Hundred Schools of Thought Contending" has just started drumming; there is absolutely no reason to tighten up yet.

But will it be that after several years, there will be enough or too much letting go and we need to tighten up a bit? I don't think so, because contradictions among the people will exist for a long time, and people should be allowed to express their opinions.

Why can we boldly implement this policy without any fear? Precisely because we have grasped Marxism-Leninism or can use Marxism-Leninism, this invincible weapon. Marxism-Leninism is not afraid to fight against different opinions or wrong opinions, and will only grow stronger in such struggles.

Is the policy of "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" a laissez-faire approach? It is not. The implementation of the policy of "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" is an important way to build socialism. Building socialism requires the leadership of Marxism-Leninism. Therefore, the implementation of the policy of "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" also requires the leadership of Marxism-Leninism. In fact, the proposal of this policy itself is a brilliant manifestation of Marxism-Leninism playing a role in China's socialist construction.

How does Marxism-Leninism lead the implementation of the policy of "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend"? The method of leadership is not to set a few precepts, formulate a few frameworks, or establish several standards for the implementation of this policy. That would become tightening up instead of letting go. The method of leadership is to actively and unreservedly participate in the "blooming" and "contending." Chairman Mao said that there are actually only two schools: Marxism-Leninism and non-Marxism-Leninism. According to this meaning, the hundred flowers can also be broadly divided into two types: the Marxism-Leninism type and the non-Marxism-Leninism type. Here, Marxism-Leninism can and should treat itself equally with other thoughts. Only in this way can Marxism-Leninism play the best leading role in "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend."

What will be the effect of "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend"? The effect must be: the correct things become more correct, and the incorrect things will also transform in the correct direction.

As a matter within the people, isn't it precisely what we should do to transform the bad into the good and the incorrect into the correct? Therefore, "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" is also an educational process for the people themselves, and it is the best educational process.

The policy of "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" has been put forward for almost a year now, but the effect is not yet obvious. I think this is because both letting go and contending must go through a certain process, and not because there are any obstacles. The blooming of a hundred flowers is not like blowing soap bubbles; one blow produces several. The contending of a hundred schools is not like speaking off the cuff; opening one's mouth spews out thousands of words. So, the delayed blooming and the delayed contending may not be a bad thing. Blowing soap bubbles and speaking off the cuff are not welcomed by everyone. But we should also see whether the branches of the hundred flowers are budding after the call for "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" and whether the minds of the hundred schools are becoming active. If not, or not enough, then there is a problem. If there is such a problem, we must find a solution. I think the main obstacles to the implementation of the policy of "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" may be that everyone's understanding of this policy is insufficient or incorrect. Especially if people in leadership positions have insufficient or incorrect understanding of this policy, or even oppose it, that is most harmful. Furthermore, the implementation of this policy must also have certain material conditions. This is also something we should pay attention to.

I also have a view. Taking the contending of a hundred schools as an example, I don't think an opinion must be published in a journal to be considered contending. Writing this opinion down for people to see or speaking it out for people to hear is also contending. For example, if an editor returns a manuscript to the author with his own opinion, it cannot be said to be suppressing contention. If the editor's rejection opinion is correct and not rude, that is also a kind of contention. If a person demands that everything he writes be printed in black and white, and does not allow the editor to participate in the opinion, then that is only allowing himself to contend and not allowing others to contend.

### 这个方针需要长期存在

    这个方针需要长期存在
    潘菽
    关于放还是收的问题，毫无疑问，毛主席的要放不要怕的指示，是完全正确的。现在的“百花齐放”是含苞刚吐，现在的“百家争鸣”是刚打起锣鼓，决没有就要收的道理。
    但是否若干年以后就会放得够了或者有余了而要收一下了呢？我认为这也不会，因为人民内部的矛盾是会长期存在的，人有意见也是应该让他说出来的。
    为什么我们可以把这个方针放手地予以贯彻执行而不必有什么害怕呢？那正是因为我们掌握了马克思列宁主义或者可以运用马克思列宁主义这个战无不胜的武器。马克思列宁主义决不怕跟不同的意见或者错误的意见作斗争而只会在这种斗争中壮大起来。
    “百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针是否是一种放任自流的办法呢？那也不是。“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针的贯彻执行，是建设社会主义的一种重要的办法。建设社会主义需要马克思列宁主义的思想作领导。因此，“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针的贯彻执行也需要马克思列宁主义的思想作领导。其实，这个方针本身的提出就是马克思列宁主义在中国的社会主义建设中发挥作用的一个光辉的体现。
    马克思列宁主义怎样领导“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针的贯彻执行呢？领导的方法并不是给这个方针的执行订下几条戒律，制定几个框子或者立出几种标准。这样就要变成收而不是放了。领导的方法是积极地，无顾虑地参加到“齐放”和“争鸣”中间去。毛主席说，百家其实只有两家，即马克思列宁主义一家和非马克思列宁主义一家。照这个意思，百花也可以大别地分作两种花，即马克思列宁主义的一种和非马克思列宁主义的一种。在这里，马克思列宁主义完全可以并且应该把自己和别的思想平等看待。只有这样，马克思列宁主义才能在“百花齐放、百家争鸣”中发挥最好的领导作用。
    “百花齐放、百家争鸣”的效果会是什么呢？效果一定是：正确的东西变得更加正确了，不正确的东西也会向正确的方面转化。
    作为人民内部的问题来看，使不好的向好的转化，使不正确的向正确的转化，这不正是我们应该做的事情吗？所以“百花齐放、百家争鸣”也就是对人民自己的一种教育过程，并且是最好的教育过程。
    现在“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针提出来已快一年了，但效果还不显。我认为这就是因为放和鸣都必须经过一定的过程，而并不是因为存在什么障碍。百花的放不像吹肥皂泡，一吹就是好几个。百家的鸣也不是信口开河，张张嘴就是千言万言。所以迟迟地放出来和迟迟地鸣起来未必不是好事。吹肥皂泡和信口开河总不是大家所欢迎的。但我们也应该看看“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的号召出来以后百花的枝头是否在孕育着苞蕾，百家的头脑是否在活跃起来。假如不或者不够，那就有问题。假如有这样的问题，就必须想办法。我觉得对“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针的贯彻执行可能有的主要妨碍是大家对这个方针的认识不够或者理解不正确。尤其是在领导地位的人假如对这个方针认识不够或者理解不正确或者根本反对，那是最有害的。再，这个方针的贯彻执行也必须有一定的物质条件。这也是我们应该予以注意的。
    我还有一种看法。以百家争鸣来说，我认为一种意见不一定要在刊物上发表出来才算是鸣。把这个意见写了出来给人看或者讲了出来给人听也就是鸣了。例如一个编者把一篇稿子附上自己的意见退回给作者，不能说是压制争鸣。假如编者的退稿意见是正确的，不是粗暴的，那也是一种争鸣。一个人假如要求自己写的什么东西都要印成白纸黑字，不许编者参加意见，那就是只许自己鸣不许别人鸣了。
