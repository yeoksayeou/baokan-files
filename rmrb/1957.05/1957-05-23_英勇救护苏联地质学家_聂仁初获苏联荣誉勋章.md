    Heroic Rescue of Soviet Geologist
    Nie Renchu Awarded Soviet Order of Honor
    (Our Moscow dispatch, 22nd) Moscow newspapers today all published on the front page the decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, issued on May 18, awarding the "Order of Honor" to Nie Renchu (transliteration), a citizen of the People's Republic of China. Nie Renchu, a guide of a certain Sino-Soviet joint geological exploration team in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, is respected by the Soviet people for his courageous actions on the banks of the Ertix River. This young man and several Chinese comrades escorted the suddenly ill Soviet geologist Stepanova to the airport in order to catch a plane to send her to Urumqi for treatment. However, when the car arrived at the Ertix River late at night, they found that the ferry was docked on the opposite bank. The river was wide, and the sound of the water was deafening, so people on the opposite bank could not hear the shouts from this side. The situation was extremely urgent, and every minute of delay would bring danger to the patient. Nie Renchu could not swim, but he climbed across the river-spanning ferry cable to the opposite bank. When he climbed to the center of the river, his body and the swaying cable were submerged in the rushing river, and his hands were also pierced by the barbed wire, but he still bravely climbed over and brought the ferry over. As a result, the patient was sent to the plane in time. "Pravda" wrote: Nie Renchu's actions are a vivid manifestation of the fraternal friendship cultivated by the Chinese and Soviet people in their joint labor.

    英勇救护苏联地质学家
    聂仁初获苏联荣誉勋章
    本报莫斯科22日电　莫斯科各报今天都在第一版刊载了苏联最高苏维埃主席团在5月18日颁布的给中华人民共和国公民聂仁初（译音）以“荣誉勋章”的指令。新疆维吾尔自治区某中苏混合地质勘探队的向导聂仁初在额尔齐斯河边的勇敢行为受到苏联人民的尊敬。这位青年和几位中国同志曾经护送突然患病的苏联地质学家斯捷潘诺娃到飞机场去，要赶上飞机，把她送到乌鲁木齐治疗。可是当汽车在深夜赶到额尔齐斯河边时，发现渡船停在对岸。河面很宽，水声澎澎，对岸人听不见这岸的呼喊。形势十分紧急，每分钟的耽搁都会给病人带来危险。聂仁初不会游泳，他抱着横过河面的摆渡铁索爬过对岸去。当爬到河中心的时候，他的身体连摇幌的铁索沉没在湍急的河流里，他的手也被铁丝刺伤了，但他还是勇敢地爬过去，把渡船弄过来。病人因此被及时地送上飞机。“真理报”写道：聂仁初的这种行为是中苏两国人民在共同的劳动中所锻炼出来的兄弟友谊的鲜明表现。
