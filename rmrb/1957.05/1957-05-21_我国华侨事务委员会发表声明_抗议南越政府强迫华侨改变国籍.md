Xinhua News Agency, 20th. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the People's Republic of China issued a statement regarding the South Vietnamese government's forcing of Overseas Chinese to change their nationality. The full text is as follows:

	In the past year, the South Vietnamese government has created a series of incidents that infringe upon the legitimate rights and interests of Overseas Chinese and force them to abandon their nationality. On August 21, 1956, the South Vietnamese government promulgated a nationality law that discriminated against Overseas Chinese, unilaterally stipulating that all Overseas Chinese born in Vietnam should be regarded as South Vietnamese citizens, and unreasonably included all Overseas Chinese born in Vietnam before the promulgation of this law within the effective scope of the law. Subsequently, the South Vietnamese government took various measures to impose restrictions and pressure on Overseas Chinese from economic and cultural aspects, forcing them to renounce their nationality and join South Vietnamese nationality. On April 17, 1957, the South Vietnamese government even announced that all residence permits it had issued in the past confirming the foreign status of Overseas Chinese born in Vietnam were null and void, and coerced them to return these residence permits before May 9, otherwise they "will be regarded as being in an illegal status." Now the South Vietnamese government is stepping up its efforts to force Overseas Chinese to go through the procedures for changing their nationality. This persecution of Overseas Chinese by the South Vietnamese government, in violation of international practice, has aroused extreme indignation and unease among our Overseas Chinese in South Vietnam, and many of them have been forced to leave South Vietnam.

	The Government of the People's Republic of China has stated on many occasions that it is willing to, in the spirit of friendly consultation and in accordance with the principles of international law, jointly resolve the nationality issue of Overseas Chinese with relevant countries. It is clear that the issue of the nationality of Overseas Chinese in South Vietnam can only be resolved reasonably through consultations between the countries concerned, based on respect for the wishes of the Overseas Chinese themselves. However, the South Vietnamese government's current practice of forcing Overseas Chinese to change their nationality not only blatantly violates the legitimate rights of Overseas Chinese in South Vietnam, but also seriously violates the principles of international law. We cannot but express our strong condemnation and lodge a serious protest against this.

	The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the People's Republic of Chinanow solemnly declares: The South Vietnamese government's regulations concerning the change of nationality of Overseas Chinese in South Vietnam are unreasonable and unilateral. The South Vietnamese government should immediately revoke these measures that violate human rights and international law. The South Vietnamese government should bear full responsibility for all the consequences arising from such unreasonable measures.

    我国华侨事务委员会发表声明
    抗议南越政府强迫华侨改变国籍
    新华社20日讯　中华人民共和国华侨事务委员会就南越政府强迫华侨改变国籍事件发表声明。全文如下：
    一年来，南越政府制造了一系列侵害华侨正当权益、强迫华侨放弃自己国籍的事件。1956年8月21日南越政府颁布了一项歧视华侨的国籍法令，单独规定凡是在越南出生的华侨都要作为南越国民，并且毫无道理地把在这个法令颁布以前在越南出生的华侨一概包括在这个法令的有效范围之内。接着，南越政府又采取种种措施从经济、文化等方面对华侨施加限制和压力，迫使他们放弃自己国籍，加入南越国籍。1957年4月17日南越政府竟把它过去所发的确认在越南出生华侨的外侨身分的居留证宣布一律作废，并且胁迫他们必须在5月9日前将这项居留证缴回，逾期“将被视为处于不合法地位”。现在南越政府正在加紧强制华侨办理改变国籍的手续。南越政府这种违反国际惯例的迫害华侨的行为，已经引起了我南越华侨的极端愤慨和不安，他们当中有许多人已经被迫离开了南越。
    中华人民共和国政府曾经多次表示愿意本着友好协商的精神，根据国际法的原则，同有关国家共同解决华侨的国籍问题。很显然，关于在南越的华侨国籍问题也只有在尊重华侨本人志愿的基础上经过有关国家的协商，才能求得合理的解决。而南越政府目前所采取的强迫华侨改变国籍的做法，不仅粗暴地侵犯了南越华侨的正当权利，而且还严重地违反了国际法的原则。对此，我们不得不表示强烈的谴责，并且提出严重的抗议。
    中华人民共和国华侨事务委员会现特郑重声明：南越政府有关改变南越华侨国籍的规定是无理的、片面的，南越政府应该立即撤销这种侵犯人权和违反国际法的措施，凡由这种无理措施而引起的一切后果，应该由南越政府负全部责任。
