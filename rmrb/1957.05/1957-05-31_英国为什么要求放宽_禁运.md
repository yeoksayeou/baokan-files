Why Does Britain Demand the Relaxation of the "Embargo"?
	Yang Zhanlin

	Recently, British public opinion has expressed increasing dissatisfaction with the United States' continued coercion of Britain to implement the "embargo." The "Times" wrote in a commentary: "The United States' policy towards China is a matter for the United States, but the United States' insistence that its allies must maintain an embargo on trade with China is not just a matter for the United States."

	On March 29, one hundred and ten members of parliament submitted a motion to the House of Commons calling for an end to the trade "embargo" on China, endorsing the recent demands made by the Federation of British Industries and industrial and commercial organizations to the government to expand trade with China.

	In this situation, the British government had to make some representation. British government officials repeatedly stated in the House of Commons in response to questions from members of parliament that Britain was determined to seek a relaxation of the "embargo" on China, and if it could not reach an agreement with the United States, Britain would take action on its own. Currently, Britain and the United States are in a deadlock in discussions on the "embargo" at a conference in Paris.

	Britain's demand for a relaxation of the trade "embargo" on China is inseparable from Britain's own vital interests. Since the war, Britain's foreign trade has been in an unfavorable position. The situation improved slightly last year, and the trade deficit was reduced. However, after the Suez War, it deteriorated again. The trade deficit in January this year reached 100.38 million pounds, an increase of 29.4 million pounds compared with the same period last year, almost equal to the total deficit for the three months of October, November and December last year. The trade deficit was only reduced in February due to reduced imports, but it still reached 31.7 million pounds. The trade surplus increased again to 49 million pounds in March.

	Due to the British government's policy of restricting domestic consumption to increase exports, Britain's exports did increase last year. However, this increase still lagged behind the growth of world trade. The total export value of the capitalist world increased by 13.7% in 1956 compared with 1955, of which Japan increased by 25.3%, West Germany increased by 20.4%, Italy increased by 18%, the United States increased by 17.3%, and Britain only increased by 9.8%. The output of manufactured goods, which occupies a major position in British exports, accounted for 22% of the capitalist world market in 1951, but fell to 19% in 1956.

	The deterioration of foreign trade has greatly increased Britain's economic difficulties. Gold and dollar reserves have shrunk, debts have increased, and the position of the pound sterling in the international market is volatile.

	There are many reasons for the sluggishness of Britain's trade, one of the important factors being its subservience to the US "embargo" policy. The United States insisted on the "embargo" in the original hope of hindering the economic development of the socialist camp countries, but the facts of the past few years have proved that the socialist world market has not only not been damaged, but has become more consolidated and developed. However, the capitalist countries that implement the "embargo" have suffered varying degrees of sales difficulties, and economic difficulties have been caused by sales difficulties. Britain is one of the countries that has suffered the most.

	Britain and the socialist camp countries originally had traditional trade relations. In 1937, the trade volume between Britain and the Soviet Union reached 2.5 billion rubles, or more than 220 million pounds. The trade volume between Britain and China also reached more than 200 million US dollars. These trade relations have been destroyed by artificial trade barriers, which cannot but seriously hit Britain's trade.

	The "embargo" also hit the economies of other countries in the sterling area. For example, Malaya, which mainly exports rubber, had a considerable trade surplus in 1950 and 1951, accumulating a lot of foreign exchange for the sterling area. However, since 1952, due to Malaya's adherence to the US "embargo" policy, and the United States took the opportunity to lower prices, Malaya has changed from a trade surplus to a trade deficit. This has not only caused great difficulties to the Malayan economy, but also deepened the difficulties of the entire sterling area.

	Britain, which originally could import many commodities from socialist countries at fair and reasonable prices, now has to turn to the United States, and the United States takes the opportunity to strengthen its exports to Britain and the entire sterling area market in order to promote its economic expansion policy. At the same time, the United States also uses tariff policies, "Buy American Act", "anti-dumping law" and other means to restrict British goods from being exported to the United States. The result of this one-sided trade is that Britain has a huge trade deficit in its trade with the United States every year, and the deficit is increasing.

	In the entire capitalist world market and in the sterling area market, Britain is also constantly subjected to strong排挤 from the United States and the West German and Japanese monopoly organizations that it has supported, and Britain's trade crisis is becoming more and more profound. Since the failure of the Anglo-French invasion of Egypt, West Germany and Japan have taken the opportunity to consolidate their positions in the Middle East and Southeast Asian markets respectively. The United States has taken advantage of the opportunity that the Anglo-French forces have been severely hit in the Middle East and has put forward the so-called "Eisenhower Doctrine" to openly seek to replace Britain's position. Facing this terrible situation, Britain has to seek countermeasures to save its position in the capitalist world market and alleviate its economic difficulties.

	In recent years, Britain has tried many ways to improve its foreign trade, such as opening commodity markets centered on London and expanding trade within the Commonwealth. At the same time, the British government has warned British industrialists and businessmen more than once to do everything possible to resist competition from the United States, West Germany, and Japan, but they have not achieved the desired results.

	Recently, Britain has placed its hopes on the Western European market again. The planned European "free trade area" is to serve this purpose. However, Britain's plan has great contradictions with the Western European countries participating in the "Common Market." The plan proposed by Britain is to require countries participating in the "free trade area" to gradually reduce tariffs and trade quota systems to expand trade, which is the same as the content of the "Common Market" plan; however, in addition to requiring mutual reduction of tariffs, the "Common Market" countries also require that each member state must stipulate a unified external tariff. If Britain agrees to this, it is equivalent to dismantling the "Imperial Preference System." Therefore, Britain proposed that the member states of the "free trade area" do not have to have a unified external tariff, and each participating country can retain its own external tariff. At the same time, the "Common Market" plan includes agricultural products. If this is also applied to the "free trade area," it will affect the competition between some Commonwealth countries and the French and Belgian colonies in Africa in providing agricultural products to Europe. Therefore, Britain's "free trade area" plan only includes industrial products, excluding food, food products, feed, tobacco, etc. Britain wants to both maintain and expand its position in the Western European market and is unwilling to give up the "Imperial Preference System."

	The issue of the "Common Market" and the "free trade area" also contains the struggle between Britain and West Germany for leadership in Western Europe. If Britain retreats on the issue of the European "free trade area," it will hand over the Western European market to West Germany. If it advances, it will also open its domestic market to its most fierce competitor. Britain has tasted enough of the sharp competition from West Germany in recent years. Under the aggressive situation of West Germany, Britain's prospects in the Western European market cannot be optimistic.

	Now, many bourgeois people in Britain have seen that it is questionable whether the "free trade area" can be formed according to Britain's calculations, and whether it can develop according to Britain's purpose even if it is formed. Therefore, they have proposed that the most realistic way to expand Britain's foreign trade at present is to relax and end the "embargo" and develop trade with socialist countries.

	The capacity of the socialist world market is expanding day by day with the continuous upsurge of the economies of the countries that make up this market. The Soviet Union has stated that it is willing to purchase 800 million to 1 billion pounds of goods from Britain in the next five years. As for China, the British business community itself estimates that the potential for importing British goods is at least between 60 million and 75 million pounds. In the past one or two years, the trade of Western European countries with China has been increasing. Although these countries' current exports to China are not large, their growth rate is very fast. Compared with these countries, Britain is moving very slowly and its trade volume is also very small. The "Daily Express" wrote on April 9: "Britain must strive for more exports: China provides a valuable market in things like mining machinery and tractors. Other countries are seizing this market. Britain must now join in, or it will fall behind." This reflects the anxiety of the British bourgeoisie.

	This is the main reason why Britain has been particularly actively seeking to relax the "embargo" recently.

    英国为什么要求放宽“禁运”
    杨湛林
    最近一个时期，英国舆论对美国继续强迫英国执行“禁运”表示了越来越大的不满。“泰晤士报”在一篇评论中写道：“美国对中国的政策是美国的事，但是，美国坚持它的盟国必须保持对中国贸易的禁运却并不是仅仅美国的事。”
    3月29日，一百一十名议员向下院提出一项动议，要求结束对中国的贸易“禁运”，赞同英国工业联合会和工商业组织最近向政府提出的扩大对华贸易的要求。
    在这种情况下，英国政府也不得不有所表示。英国政府负责官员在下院答复议员责问时一再表示，英国决心要求得放宽对中国的“禁运”，如果不能同美国取得协议，英国将自己采取行动。目前，英国同美国正在巴黎的讨论“禁运”的会议上争持不下。
    英国要求放宽对中国的贸易“禁运”，这是同英国的切身利益分不开的。战后以来，英国的对外贸易一直处于不利地位。去年的情况略有好转，逆差有了减少。但苏伊士战争以后，又趋恶化，今年1月份的贸易逆差达一亿零三百八十万英镑，比去年同期增加了二千九百四十万英镑，几乎等于去年10、11、12三个月逆差的总和。2月份只是由于削减了进口，才减少了逆差，但也达到三千一百七十万英镑。3月份的入超又增加到四千九百万英镑。
    由于英国政府采取限制国内消费来增加出口的政策，去年英国的出口是增加了。但是这种增加仍然落后于世界贸易额的增长。去年资本主义世界的出口总值比1955年增加了13.7％，其中日本增加了25.3％，西德增加20.4％，意大利增加18％，美国增加17.3％，而英国只增加9.8％。在英国出口中占主要地位的制成品输出，1951年占资本主义世界市场的22％，而1956年降为19％。
    对外贸易的恶化，大大增加了英国的经济困难。黄金美元储备缩减，债务增加，英镑在国际市场上的地位动荡不定。
    造成英国贸易情况不振的原因很多，其中一个重要因素是屈从美国的“禁运”政策。美国硬搞“禁运”，原想借以阻挠社会主义阵营国家经济的发展，但是几年来的事实证明，社会主义世界市场不但未受损害，反而更加巩固、更加发展了。而执行“禁运”的各资本主义国家，却遭受了不同程度的销售困难，并因销售困难而引起了经济困难。英国是受害最大的国家之一。
    英国和社会主义阵营国家原来有着传统的贸易关系。1937年，英苏两国的贸易额曾达到二十五亿卢布，即二亿二千多万英镑。英国同中国的贸易额，也曾达到二亿多美元。这些贸易关系被人为的贸易壁垒所破坏，不能不严重地打击了英国的贸易。
      “禁运”还打击了英镑区其他国家的经济。例如以输出橡胶为主的马来亚，在1950年和1951年，都有相当大的出超，为英镑区积储了不少外汇。但自1952年以后，由于马来亚奉行了美国的“禁运”政策，美国又乘机压价，马来亚遂由出超一变而为入超。这不但给马来亚经济造成了极大的困难，而且也加深了整个英镑区的困难。
    英国原来可以从社会主义国家以公平合理的价格输入的许多商品，现在不得不转而依赖于美国，而美国也就乘机加强对英国和整个英镑区市场的输出，以推行它的经济扩张政策。与此同时，美国又运用关税政策、“买美国货法”、“反倾销法”等手段，限制英国商品对美国的输出。这种片面贸易的结果，使英国在对美贸易中每年都有巨大入超，逆差日益扩大。
    在整个资本主义世界市场上以及在英镑区市场上，英国也不断受到美国及其一手扶植起来的西德、日本垄断组织的有力排挤，而英国的贸易危机也就越来越深刻。自英法侵埃战争失败后，西德和日本乘机分别巩固了它们在中东和东南亚市场上的地位。美国更利用英法势力在中东受到沉重打击的机会，搬出了所谓“艾森豪威尔主义”，明目张胆地谋取英国的地位而代之。面对着这一可怕的情况，英国不得不寻求对策，以挽救它在资本主义世界市场上的地位，缓和它的经济困难。
    近年来，英国为了改善它的对外贸易是曾经想过许多办法的，如开放以伦敦为中心的商品市场、扩张英联邦内部贸易等。同时，英国政府也曾不止一次地向英国工商业者提出警告，要他们尽一切力量抵御来自美国、西德、日本的竞争，但都没有得到预期的效果。
    最近以来，英国又把希望寄托在西欧市场上，拟议中的欧洲“自由贸易区”，就是为这一目的服务的。但英国的打算同参加“共同市场”的西欧各国有很大矛盾。英国所提的计划，是要求参加“自由贸易区”各国相互间逐步减低关税和贸易限额制度以扩大贸易，这是和“共同市场”计划的内容相同的；但是“共同市场”各国除要求相互减低关税外，还要求各成员国必须规定一致的对外关税。英国如果同意这一点，那就等于拆了“帝国特惠制”的台。因此，英国提出：“自由贸易区”各成员国不必有一个一致的对外关税，各参加国可各自保留自己的对外关税。同时，“共同市场”计划中包括农产品在内。如果让这一点也适用于“自由贸易区”，就会影响到一些英联邦国家同法比等国在非洲的殖民地在向欧洲提供农产品方面进行的竞争。因此，英国的“自由贸易区”计划只包括工业品，而把粮食、粮食制品、饲料、烟草等除外。英国是既想保持和扩大自己在西欧市场上的地位，又不愿放弃“帝国特惠制”。
    在“共同市场”和“自由贸易区”的问题上，还包含着英国和西德争夺西欧领导权的斗争。英国在欧洲“自由贸易区”问题上，退固然会把西欧市场拱手让给西德，进也会把它自己的国内市场开放给它的最凶猛的竞争者。英国原想利用“自由贸易区”计划来维持它在西欧市场上的地位，但结果却会招来一场新的极其剧烈的市场争夺战。西德竞争的锋芒，几年来英国是尝够了的。在西德咄咄逼人的形势下，英国在西欧市场上的前景不能乐观。
    现在，英国许多资产阶级人士已经看出，“自由贸易区”能否按照英国的算盘组成，组成了又能否按英国的目的发展，都是有问题的。因此，他们纷纷提出，目前把英国对外贸易扩大一步的一条最现实的道路，就是放宽和结束“禁运”，发展同社会主义国家的贸易。
    社会主义世界市场的容量，随着组成这一市场的各个国家的经济的不断高涨，正在日益扩大着。苏联曾经表示过，愿意在今后五年内向英国购买八亿至十亿英镑的货物。至于中国，英国工商界自己估计，目前输入英国商品的潜力至少在六千万至七千五百万英镑之间。近一两年来，西欧国家对中国的贸易已经在增加了。这些国家目前对中国的出口虽然还不算大，但增长速度很快。比起这些国家来，英国是走得很慢的，贸易额也很小。“每日快报”在4月9日写道：“英国必须争取更多的出口：中国在矿业机械和拖拉机等类东西方面提供了一个宝贵的市场。别的国家正在夺取这个市场。英国现在必须参加进去，否则就要落后了。”这反映了英国资产阶级的焦虑心情。
    英国最近特别积极谋求放宽“禁运”，其主要原因就在这里。
