Comrade Voroshilov Strolls Through Zhongnanhai
    Li Yueran
    
    4:50 PM on April 16th.

    The South Sea in front of Qin Zheng Hall was as still as water in a bowl. The weeping willows along the shore did not move, and a small group of ducks roamed the sea.

    Chairman Voroshilov walked down the steps and began to stroll. He held a cane in his right hand, but not to help him walk, but to serve as a pointer for the guide. This chrysanthemum-yellow cane was about thirty years old, and it had been polished by its owner's hand. The cane pointed east for a moment and west for a moment.

    Forty or fifty steps to the right of the main entrance of Qin Zheng Hall, there is a pavilion with the words "Jiexiu Pavilion" written on it. After understanding the meaning of the words, Comrade Voroshilov said to the people behind him: Why don't you young and handsome people go to the pavilion? Let's go! Although I am not handsome, I still want to go up with you. The old man took the hands of two comrades next to him and walked up to Jiexiu Pavilion.

    The quiet lake, the weeping willows by the sea, the telescope fish in the water, and the ancient pines and Qing residences on Yingtai Island had been waiting impatiently for a long time. A wild duck on the water, as if a representative elected by them, suddenly flew off the water and called out a few times, which indeed made Comrade Voroshilov stroll over. The old man faced the South Sea, pushed his dark gray hat up, and shook his head constantly from side to side. It's so beautiful, the air is so good! The South Sea finally heard Comrade Voroshilov's praise. Why didn't Peter and Nadya come for a walk together! The expression on Comrade Voroshilov's face when he said this made it easy for people to realize that he was regretting for his son and daughter-in-law, because they had gone out and could not enjoy the beautiful scenery with him at this moment.

    After carefully looking at Yingtai Island again, Comrade Voroshilov stood sideways, turned his head to everyone and said: Sixty years ago, Empress Dowager Cixi imprisoned her son here. I was sixteen or seventeen years old that year. If I had known about this at that time, I could have come to help Guangxu, and maybe I would have let that old woman taste a bit of my power. Everyone laughed at what he said. A Soviet comrade accompanying him said to Comrade Voroshilov: Kliment Yefremovich! Did you see those ducks? I heard that you can't hit them. Comrade Voroshilov replied humorously: Of course you can't hit them, they are sacred ducks left by the emperors of the past. Aren't you afraid that God will blame you!

    The strolling people came to a small courtyard in laughter and conversation. The plum blossoms blooming inside exuded an attractive fragrance, but they were worried that the distinguished guests would pass by without appreciating its delicate flowers. Comrade Voroshilov walked gently to the plum blossoms and took a deep breath. His smiling face made it easy for people to think of the joy in the old man's heart. Comrade Voroshilov looked around and said to everyone: The plum blossoms in this courtyard are particularly fragrant!

    The "Quiet Valley" rockery also welcomed guests today. The unique characteristics here aroused Comrade Voroshilov's great interest. The old man walked along the path to the top of the mountain and found a stone. He called everyone together and said: Look, this stone looks like an old woman. This is the nose, this is the mouth. The old man pointed with his cane, and then said, She is suffering so much from being pressed here. She is complaining to us about the cruelty of the past emperors.

    During the walk, Comrade Voroshilov saw a red bungalow. An accompanying comrade came forward to suggest not going in, as it was a soldiers' dormitory, but before he could finish speaking, the old man had already waved to the soldiers to greet them.

    The soldiers who were resting, playing ball, playing the piano, and singing, suddenly saw Chairman Voroshilov coming. They could not restrain the joy and excitement from their hearts. They cheered, they jumped up. Comrade Voroshilov waved his hands and greeted the soldiers. He said several times in his mouth, why don't you come and see the lives of the soldiers. Comrade Voroshilov began to ask if the local leader was there. A captain rushed over. Comrade Voroshilov immediately stood at attention to the captain, as if a young soldier was reporting to a superior officer, and then said: Soviet Marshal Voroshilov has come to visit your dormitory, may I come in? The young captain was stunned and replied after a while with the words "We welcome you." Comrade Voroshilov said affectionately as if he had seen his old soldiers and come to his own company: Come, young men, let's talk together. Comrade Voroshilov asked the captain to walk in front, and he followed. A long bungalow. As soon as he entered the house, the old man first looked around and then asked the soldiers how many people lived there. The answer was eight people. The old man counted the beds one by one and said to himself that there were eight. He also asked if it was crowded, and the answer was no. Comrade Voroshilov measured the distance between the beds with his cane and said to himself again, there is half a meter, it is not crowded. He asked Comrade Voroshilov where the stove was installed in winter, where the chimney went out, whether they changed their clothes often, and how they ate. The answers of the soldiers and their eyes full of youthful joy reassured the old man about the lives of the soldiers. The old man said, you are living well, you must work hard, everyone must be solid...

    Comrade Voroshilov decided to walk around the South Sea, so the old man strode forward along the coast. At this time, his cane seemed a bit superfluous. The old man walked very fast, and the young people behind him had to speed up, otherwise they would really be left behind. Someone advised him to walk slower, the old man glanced at him and smiled, and quickened his pace instead.

    Dormitories in Zhongnanhai are rarely visited for walks in peacetime. Today, Chairman Voroshilov's footprints were also left on this land. There was a children's car in front of the dormitory, with four or five five- or six-year-old children sitting in it, ready to be sent to the nursery. Several people were standing around the car. At this time, Comrade Voroshilov seemed to have made a new discovery and said loudly to everyone, look, the masses are here. The old man rushed forward a few steps and picked up two of the children, and the ones in the car also climbed out. Two little girls were a little shy and dodged, but the old Comrade Voroshilov, who was old and respected, could also make these two little girls laugh. Although the old man could not speak Chinese, his kind eyes, amiable face, and especially his love for children, made these children really not want to leave this Soviet old grandpa. Comrade Voroshilov managed to get his hands out of the crowd of children. He touched his pocket and realized that he had not brought a piece of candy when he came out. The old man did not know what to do for a while, and said two sentences, I am sorry for you, children, I will definitely make up for my mistake next time, I will definitely bring candy to you... At this time, the children's mothers, nannies, and people of all ages in the dormitory came out. The workers in the boiler room and the cooks in the restaurant had long forgotten the coal ash on their faces and the oil on their hands, and they all rushed over to see Comrade Voroshilov. Laughter and applause were connected. Right here, one or twenty lively and lovely children and Comrade Voroshilov, one of the leaders of the Soviet people, were captured in the photographer's lens. At twenty minutes to seven, Comrade Voroshilov reluctantly broke up with the children and said to their mothers: I wish you all happiness, you must educate your children well, they are our future, I wish the children grow up quickly and become adults, so as to benefit mankind, goodbye, comrades.

    Comrade Voroshilov stayed in the house for a short while, then came out and walked hand in hand with Vice Chairman Zhu De towards Huai Ren Tang to attend Chairman Mao's banquet.

    伏老漫步中南海
    李越然
    4月16日下午，差十分六点。
    勤政殿前面的南海平静的像碗里的水，沿海边的垂柳一动不动，一小群鸭子在海中漫游。
    伏罗希洛夫主席走下台阶，开始散步了。他右手拿着手杖，但不是用来帮助走路，而是要它起一些解说员指棍的作用。这根菊黄色的手杖三十来岁了，它已经被主人的手抚摸的发光了。手杖一会儿指向东，一会儿指向西。
    勤政殿正门右侧四五十步的地方有一凉亭，上面写着“结秀亭”，伏老了解了字意后，对后面的几个人说：你们这些年轻貌秀的人怎么不到亭子里去呢？走！我虽然不秀，可是也要同你们一起上去，老人家拉起旁边两位同志的手走上结秀亭了。
    静静的湖水，海边的垂柳，水里的望天鱼，瀛台上的古松清舍早已等急了，水上的一只野鸭好像它们推举的代表，突然飞开水面叫了几声，果然使伏老漫步地走过去了。老人家面向南海，把深灰色的礼帽向上推了推，头不断地向两边摇摆。美极了，空气真好啊！南海终于听到了伏老的夸奖。怎么彼得和娜佳不一起来散步呢！伏老说这句话时的神情，很容易使人体会到他是在替儿子和儿媳妇惋惜，因为他们出去了，此刻不能同他一起共赏美景。
    伏老又仔细地看了看瀛台之后，斜身站着，把头转向大家说：六十年前就在这儿，那慈禧太后把儿子关起来了，那年我已经十六、七岁了，如果当时我知道此事，也可以来帮一帮光绪，也许会叫那老婆子尝到点厉害。大家都被说笑了。一位同陪的苏联同志对伏老说：克利门特·叶弗列莫维奇！你看到了那些鸭子吗？听说不可以打。伏老幽默地回答说：当然不能打，那是过去皇帝留下的神鸭，怎么敢打，你也不怕上帝怪罪！
    散步的人们在谈笑中来到了一个小院面前，里面盛开着的梅花发出引人的香味，可是又担心贵宾们越门而过不去欣赏它那娇艳的花朵。伏老脚步轻轻地，走到梅花前深深地吸了一口气，他那微笑的面容不难使人想到老人家心中的愉快。伏老四下望了望，对大家说：这院里的梅花分外地香啊！
    “静谷”假山今天也迎接了客人。这里的别致特色引起了伏老的很大兴趣。老人家沿着小路往山顶上走，发现了一块石头，他把大家都叫到一起说：你们看这块石头活像个老太婆，这是鼻子，这是嘴，老人家用手杖指着，接着又说，她被压在这多难受啊，她在向我们控诉过去皇帝的残酷。
    散步中，伏老看到了一座红色平房，一位陪同的同志前来建议不要进去了，里面是战士宿舍，可是话还未说完，老人家已经向战士们招手问候了。
    正在休息的战士们打球、拉琴、歌唱，突然看到伏罗希洛夫主席来了，他们无法抑制出自内心的喜悦和兴奋，他们欢呼，他们跳起来了。伏老挥动双手，向战士们问好，他嘴里连说了几次，为什么不来看看战士的生活呢。伏老开始问此地首长在不在。一位上尉急忙赶过来，伏老立刻像一个年轻的士兵向上级军官作报告似的，对准上尉作立正姿势，随即说道：苏联元帅伏罗希洛夫前来参观你们的宿舍，可以进去吗？这位年轻的上尉呆住了，停了一会儿才答复出这么几个字“我们欢迎你”。伏老像见到了自己过去的老战士，像来到了自己的连队亲切地说道：来来，小伙子们，咱们一块儿谈谈。伏老请上尉走在前，自己跟着。一间长条平房。一进屋老人家先四周看了看，随即问战士们几个人住，回答是八个人。老人家把床铺一一地数了一遍，对自己说是八个。他又问挤不挤，回答是不挤。伏老用手杖量了量床间的距离，又对自己说，有半公尺，是不挤。冬天火炉安在那儿，烟筒从什么地方出去，是否常换衣服，吃饭怎样都给伏老问到了，看样子战士们的回答和他们的充满青春喜悦的目光，使老人家对战士的生活放心了。老人说，你们生活得很好，要好好工作，每个人都要结结实实的……。
    伏老决定绕南海走一圈，于是老人家迈开健壮的步伐沿海边走下去，这时他的手杖倒显得有些多余了。老人家走得挺快，跟在后面的青年人不得不加油，否则真得给丢下。有人劝他走慢些，老人家瞅他笑了笑，脚步反而加快了。
    中南海里的宿舍在平时很少有人来散步，今天在这块土地上也留下了伏罗希洛夫主席的足迹。宿舍门前有一辆儿童车，里面坐着四、五个准备送托儿所去的五、六岁的小孩，车周围还站着好几个。这时伏老好像得到了新发现，高声地对大家说，你们看，人民群众在这儿哪，老人家几步抢上去把孩子抱起两个来，车里的也都爬出来了。有两个小姑娘有点眼生，躲躲闪闪的，可是年高德劭的伏老也可以叫这两个小姑娘笑起来。虽然老人家不能讲中文，但是他那慈祥的目光，和蔼可亲的面孔，尤其是他那热爱儿童的心灵，使这些孩子们实在不想离开这位苏联老爷爷了。伏老好容易从孩子群中把手脱出来，一摸兜才发觉出来的时候一块糖也没有带，老人家这一时不知如何是好，连说了两句，我对不起你们，孩子们，下次一定弥补错误，一定带糖来给你们……。这时孩子们的妈妈、保姆，宿舍内的大大小小都出来，锅炉房的工人，餐厅的厨师早忘了他们脸上的煤灰和手上的油，也都赶过来见伏老。欢笑声，鼓掌声连成一片。就在这，一、二十个活泼可爱的孩子同苏联人民的领导者之一伏罗希洛夫主席一起被摄入摄影师的镜头了。差二十分七点了，伏老难舍地同孩子们分了手，并向他们的妈妈说：祝大家幸福，你们要好好教育儿女，他们是我们的未来，祝孩子们快快长大成人，好为人类造福，再见，同志们。
    伏老进屋稍停片刻，出来同朱德副主席手挽手地漫步走向怀仁堂参加毛主席的宴会去了。
