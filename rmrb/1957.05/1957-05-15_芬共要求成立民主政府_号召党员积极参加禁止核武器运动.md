Xinhua News Agency, Helsinki, May 14th: According to TASS, the Central Committee of the Finnish Communist Party held a plenary session on May 11th and 12th. The plenary session discussed issues such as the domestic situation, the draft of the new party program, and preparations for the upcoming 11th Party Congress.

The plenary session adopted a statement from the Central Committee. The statement pointed out that, due to the serious situation caused by the domestic government crisis, the Coalition Party and its associates are still attempting to establish a reactionary government and implement policies that violate the interests of the working people and the entire people.

The Central Committee called for resisting such attempts by reactionary groups, and declared that what is needed now is a government that relies on the support of workers, small landholders, and other advanced sections of the people, with the participation of democratic elements.

The plenary session also passed a resolution on the issue of stopping atomic and hydrogen weapon tests, calling on party members to actively participate in the movement to ban the testing and use of nuclear weapons.
