    Rectification While Improving
    Central Academy of Arts and Crafts Now Under the Leadership of the Ministry of Culture

    Xinhua News Agency, 22nd—Based on the demands recently raised by teachers and students of the Central Academy of Arts and Crafts during the rectification campaign, the State Council has now agreed to place the Central Academy of Arts and Crafts under the leadership of the Ministry of Culture.

    The teachers and students of the Central Academy of Arts and Crafts warmly support this measure of "rectification while improving." Currently, the students are busily preparing for exams, and the teachers are also studying and preparing to propose a draft plan for arts and crafts teaching work.

    In the past, the Ministry of Culture did not assume the responsibility of leading this higher art academy; the academy was actually led by the Central Handicraft Bureau. According to the teachers and students of the academy, the Central Handicraft Bureau had many bureaucratic problems in leading the academy's work and neglected the characteristics of higher art education. The teachers and students of the school unanimously requested that the Ministry of Culture lead the academy and improve the teaching work.

    边整风　边改进
    中央工艺美术学院已归文化部领导
    新华社22日讯　根据中央工艺美术学院师生最近在整风中提出的要求，国务院目前已经同意将中央工艺美术学院交文化部领导。
    中央工艺美术学院的师生热烈拥护这一“边整风，边改进”的措施。目前学生们正紧张地准备考试，教师们也在研究和准备提出有关工艺美术教学工作的规划草案。
    文化部过去没有担负起领导这所高等艺术学院的责任，这个学院过去实际上是由中央手工业管理局领导的。据这个学院的师生反映，中央手工业管理局在领导学院的工作中，存在许多官僚主义，忽视了高等艺术教育的特点。这个学校的师生们一致要求由文化部领导这个学院，并改进教学工作。
