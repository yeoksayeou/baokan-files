Speak Out What's on Your Mind
    --The People's Bank of China Party Committee Listens to Criticism from Non-Party Cadres	Lin Hong
    Recently, the Chinese Communist Party Committee of the People's Bank of China (hereinafter referred to as the Bank Party Committee) convened its third Party Representative Congress, with the main agenda being to examine the cooperative working relationship between Party members and non-Party members in the institution. The meeting invited some members of democratic parties and non-party individuals in the institution to participate. During and before this period, it also listened to the opinions of various democratic parties and non-party individuals through joint party meetings and group discussions. In addition to being excited about the Bank Party Committee inviting them to participate in Party meetings and listening to their opinions, the democratic parties and non-party individuals raised many sharp criticisms of the Bank Party Committee's shortcomings and errors in implementing the Party's united front policy.

    Zhu Shaowen said:
    Intellectuals are suppressed, their innermost feelings are like a pool of stagnant water.

    In speeches at the congress and in group discussions, some members of democratic parties and non-party individuals talked about the feelings and experiences of non-Party intellectuals in recent years. Zhu Shaowen, Deputy Director of the People's Bank of China Branch of the China National Democratic Construction Association, believed that intellectuals have been hurt and suppressed in recent years, and their innermost feelings are like a pool of stagnant water; they want to speak but lack the strength, and they want to release their feelings but lack the courage. He said: Now there are also people among the masses who are not afraid of retaliation. Their uneasy and angry feelings can no longer be suppressed, and they are willing to speak and release their feelings; but they always feel that it is better to do less than more, and fear that speaking out will not solve the problem. He also said: Past experience has made the masses develop a mentality of daring to be angry but not daring to speak out, feeling that their lives are only so-so, and it is good enough to have a bowl of rice to eat, let alone other extravagant hopes. He believes that this ideological tendency is not individual, but rather a manifestation of a considerable number of people emotionally and deeply distancing themselves from the Party. He said: This should not be blamed on the backwardness of the masses; it should be the responsibility of the Party organizations and Party members in the institution. I think the main problem is sectarianism, underestimating non-Party cadres, treating them as rulers, as meritorious officials, and even a few Party members treating them as conquerors, regarding non-Party cadres as mere servants to be summoned and ordered about. Li Weicheng, a member of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang and Deputy Director of the Design and Research Committee, also believes that the relationship between Party members and non-Party members is not equal, but rather a relationship of "I am the master, you are the slave." He said: The Three-Anti Movement made intellectuals dizzy and unable to speak again; after the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries, our feelings were "wanting to cry but not daring to weep, smiling but not happy."

    Zhu Shaowen said in his speech that the reason why non-Party cadres dare to be angry but not dare to speak out is that, on the one hand, Party members hold the attitude of "laugh or scold as you like, I will still be a good official," and speaking out will not have any effect. On the other hand, even worse, the masses are afraid of being baited and retaliated against. He said: In past movements, the leadership always instructed to absolutely prohibit retaliation; but afterwards, there were always people who retaliated against those who made suggestions, labeling them with hats such as "impure motives," "individualism," "attacking the leadership," and even "anti-Party and anti-revolutionary," causing them a lot of trouble. He cited the example of a Party member director in the Foreign Business Bureau who, whenever the masses gave him suggestions, he would consider it "the rise of evil spirits," "unhealthy," and so on, and retaliate against those who made suggestions. Zheng Bobin, Deputy Director of the Financial Research Institute, also had the same view, believing that the Bank Party Committee's inspection of united front work this time should "listen to their words and observe their actions." Zheng Bobin said: Don't treat us as thieves to guard against all the time.

    Many non-Party cadres believe that the sectarianism within the People's Bank of China Party is very serious. As long as someone is a Party member, it seems that everything is good, and Party members are responsible for everything; as long as someone is a non-Party cadre, it seems that everything is not good, and they are very distrustful of them. Someone criticized Party members, saying: In the past, you treated female employees in the institution as vases; today, you treat veteran personnel as flowerpots. Zheng Bobin said: In the past, during the period of white terror, Party members often interacted with us and explained current affairs to me; now the relationship between the Party and non-Party members is not as good as before, and the relationship between individuals and the Party has become distant. Is it that we have become more backward than before? I hope the Party can be open and honest and treat us as our own people, instead of treating us as thieves to guard against all the time; otherwise, even if there are no problems, many problems will arise.

    The masses respect Party members who have contributed to the revolution from the bottom of their hearts; however, many Party members are complacent and look down on non-Party individuals, and even some Party members who do not hold high positions put on airs. Zhu Shaowen said: Some ordinary Party members who do confidential work often ask non-Party section-level cadres to correct unclear wording on documents, while they sit aside reading newspapers and smoking, and sometimes even rudely scold them.

    Hoping to truly play a role, unwilling to sit and eat.

    Having accumulated considerable knowledge and experience in years of study and work, and being willing to contribute them to the country and the people, but having no place to exert their strength, this is the most distressing thing for non-Party senior intellectuals. Some of them have not been able to fully utilize their strengths due to improper work arrangements. According to Zhu Shaowen, the Foreign Business Bureau asks people who are not familiar with trade business to engage in trade-related work, and people who are familiar with trade business to engage in non-trade-related work. Li Dazhang originally held a very important position in the local area; but since being transferred to the head office in 1953, he has been doing "clean-up" work. Chen Mingyi, Director of the Public-Private Joint Banking Business Department, believes that the personnel arrangements during the major merger of public-private joint banks in 1952 were a "misguided matchmaker," with many people being improperly arranged, and people with many years of banking experience being asked to count banknotes and sort vouchers. A doctor who specialized in economic issues was also assigned to do this type of work, and later he was asked to switch to teaching English. Song Leyan, a teacher at the Foreign Exchange Training Class, said: My work arrangement has always been inappropriate. I am familiar with foreign exchange and banking business, but I am not allowed to engage in this area of work.

    Although the work of many other people is basically appropriately arranged, they cannot play a good role because the organization does not dare to use them boldly, and they are not given the necessary conditions to do their work well. Zheng Bobin said: Now that we are building socialism, we are willing to share weal and woe with Party members, but you only ask us to eat and read, and we feel very distressed. Zheng Bobin was originally the Deputy Principal of the Bank Cadre School. He said: We strive to link teaching with practice, but we cannot see documents and materials and do not know what the head office is doing. We are not as good as the teachers at Renmin University, because they are Party members and can attend branch bank director meetings and go to various departments and bureaus to collect materials, but we cannot. Some people criticize us for teaching dogmatism, but how can we not be dogmatic? Lin Fengbao is a foreign exchange expert with more than 30 years of experience who is familiar with the situation in foreign markets, but he has not been allowed to do the work he is most familiar with in recent years. He said with great emotion: Children cannot learn to walk without falling a few times; I am not a child, but you are afraid that something will happen to me. Time waits for no one, and the first five-year plan is almost over, and I cannot withstand a few more five-year plans! Wu Qingyou, a famous translator and Director of the Bank Expert Studio, and other comrades also expressed the same sigh. Non-Party Cadres Criticize the Cadre Policy: Some Party Members Lack Both Virtue and Talent but Hold Important Positions

    The bank's cadre policy has serious sectarian tendencies, which is also one of the issues sharply criticized by many non-Party individuals. They believe that there are two standards for measuring cadres: one is virtue, and the other is talent. However, some Party members lack both virtue and talent, but they hold important positions and do not do their work well. A Party member has a bad work style, a low level of education, and poor working ability, but he is still asked to be a section chief. According to some non-Party comrades, the situation of incompetent Party member leading cadres in the Foreign Business Bureau is quite serious. The masses have many opinions about a certain Party member director, believing that he has only been able to handle retail business after being in the city for seven or eight years. Some rules and regulations related to business in this department have not yet been formulated, and Party member leaders should be fully responsible for this.

    Some people say that Party member leading cadres are laymen in business, but if they trust experts or can go deep into the grassroots to listen to opinions, things will be much easier. However, many Party members are arrogant and self-righteous, pretend to know what they do not know, and their work style is not in-depth. When making plans and summaries, they often rely on reports from Party members; and they often delay in processing the things sent to them from below. Song Leyan reflected that he taught at the Foreign Exchange Training Class, but the teaching summary was made by the principal and students together, without his participation.

    Sectarianism is also manifested in the cultivation and promotion of cadres. Some non-Party comrades believe that Party members were promoted faster in the past. For example, all the cadres promoted by the Industrial Credit Bureau last year were Party members, but a non-Party person who had been a section chief for a long time and was also an advanced worker was not promoted. The Party must know people and be good at employing them, and Party members must be modest.

    Many non-Party comrades said in their speeches that they hoped that the Party would understand the characteristics of intellectuals, help them with ideological transformation, and also give full play to their strengths. At the same time, they also hoped that Party members could overcome their pride and humbly learn from the strengths of non-Party comrades, so that everyone can exchange ideas and improve together. Zheng Bobin and Hu Xiongding both said that the vast majority of senior intellectuals are patriotic, and they have all gone through certain hardships to achieve academic achievements. Therefore, the Party should boldly trust and use them, and not make them stand on the sidelines of national construction. Hu Xiongding believes that intellectuals are living wealth, and if they are not used for a long time, they will degenerate and die. Lin Fengbao also said: Now some people who study economic issues go to the Qing Palace to look up materials on the market, prices, and currency during the late Qing Dynasty, the early Republic of China, and even the period of the Northern Warlords, but we are living materials, why don't you come to us? In my business knowledge and work experience, 90% of things may be outdated, but the remaining 10% is also worth learning, right? If you don't learn, you are the ones who suffer. Don't look down on us too much. I am willing to contribute my knowledge and experience as soon as possible!

    Party members were shocked.
    Feeling the seriousness of the problem.

    Many Party members were shocked by these criticisms from non-Party comrades. They originally thought that although there were problems with the bank's united front work, it was not so serious. Therefore, some Party groups initially did not conduct in-depth and thorough inspections of cooperative working relationships, and even felt that there was nothing to inspect. After non-Party comrades made criticisms at large and small meetings, many Party members woke up from their dreams and felt that internal contradictions among the people were also very sharp in the institution. Therefore, they generally adopted an attitude of warm welcome and humble listening to the criticisms and suggestions of non-Party comrades, believing that the speeches of non-Party comrades had great positive significance, added a new atmosphere to the Party Representative Congress, and were very helpful in promoting rectification within the Party. Some people said that this was a wake-up call for our Party; others said that participating in this Party Representative Congress was like attending a short-term training class. Some people also conducted self-examination in connection with their ideology. Zhu Ping said that he had never thought of letting non-Party comrades serve in the leadership of the group in the past. Zhao Rongxuan said: There is indeed a serious sense of pride within our Party. The criticisms of non-Party comrades this time reminded Party members that they must work hard to improve themselves in order to adapt to the needs of the new situation.

    However, judging from the reflections inside and outside the Party, there are still some Party members, especially some Party members above the level of directors and bureau chiefs, who have not fully woken up from their dreams. Their speeches have not yet jumped out of the circle of formulaic and conceptual language, and they have not exposed many problems or dug deep into their thoughts. Even the speeches of individual Party member directors and bureau chiefs gave the impression that they were boasting about their achievements. Many comrades inside and outside the Party were dissatisfied with this situation. Some non-Party comrades criticized these Party members for not knowing the true face of Mount Lu because they were on the mountain. Some non-Party comrades believed that this was because Party members and non-Party members were in different positions and had different feelings. What was not a big problem in the eyes of Party members might be a big problem in the eyes of non-Party comrades.

    These opinions from inside and outside the Party were promptly reported to the bank's Party group and Party committee. They believed that this inspection was only a beginning, and the internal inspection was not in-depth and thorough, and there were still many opinions outside the Party that had not been expressed. Therefore, they decided to continue to inspect the relationship between the Party and non-Party members in the rectification movement. On the one hand, they would criticize and correct erroneous thoughts and emotions within the Party through persuasive education, and on the other hand, they would continue to widely solicit opinions from non-Party individuals.

    把憋在心里的话讲出来
    ——人民银行党委听取非党干部的批评	林洪
    最近时期，中共人民银行委员会（以下简称银行党委），以检查机关中党员与非党员的合作共事关系为主要议题，召开了第三次党员代表大会。会议邀请了机关中部分民主党派和无党派的同志参加，同时在这期间和这以前，还通过党派联席会议和小组座谈等方式，听取了各民主党派和无党派同志的意见。各民主党派和无党派的同志，除了对银行党委吸收他们参加党的会议，听取他们的意见感到兴奋以外，对银行党委在贯彻执行党的统战政策中的缺点和错误提出了许多尖锐的批评。
    朱绍文说：
    知识分子受到压抑，心情深处像一潭积水
    在大会发言和小组座谈中，一些民主党派和无党派的同志，都谈到这几年来非党知识分子的心情和感受。民建会人民银行支部副主任委员朱绍文认为，这几年来知识分子受到了损伤和压抑，他们的心情深处已经像是一潭积水，欲鸣无力，欲放无胆了。他说：现在群众中也有不怕报复的人，他们不平和愤怒的心情已经抑制不住，愿意鸣和放；但又总觉得多一事不如少一事，怕说了不解决问题。他又说：过去的经验，已经使群众产生了一种敢怒而不敢言的心理，觉得自己的一生也不过如此，能有一碗饭吃就好了，还谈什么其他的侈望呢？他认为，这种思想倾向不是个别的，而是相当多数的，是在感情上和内心深处离开了党的表现。他说：这不应该责怪群众落后，应该由机关党组织和党员负责。我以为主要毛病在于宗派主义，轻视非党干部，以统治者，以功臣，甚至有少数党员以征服者自居，把非党干部当做单纯的呼来唤去的仆役。民革成员、设计研究委员会副主任委员李维城也认为，党员与非党员不是平等的关系，而是吾为主尔为奴的关系。他说：三反运动把知识分子打得头昏眼花，再不敢讲话；肃反以后，我们的心情是欲哭不哀，虽笑不乐。
    朱绍文在发言中谈到，非党干部所以敢怒而不敢言，一方面是因为党员抱着“笑骂由你，好官我自为之”的态度，说了也不起什么作用。另一方面更有甚者，是群众害怕钓鱼报复。他说：在过去的运动中，领导上总是交代绝对禁止报复；但是以后就是有人对提意见的人进行报复，给他们扣上“动机不纯”、“个人主义”、“打击领导”甚至“反党反革命”的帽子，反而惹了一身麻烦。他举出国外业务局的一位党员处长就是这样，凡是有群众给他提意见，他就认为是“邪气上升”、“不健康”等等，对提意见的人进行报复。金融研究所副所长郑伯彬也有同样的看法，他认为对银行党委这次检查统战工作，应当“听其言而观其行”。郑伯彬说：不要整天把我们当贼来防
    好些非党的干部都认为，人民银行党内的宗派主义作风很严重，只要是党员，似乎就一切都好，事事都要党员负责；只要是非党干部，似乎就一切都不好，对他们很不信任。有人批评党员说：过去把机关中的女职员当花瓶，今天你们把旧人员当花盆。郑伯彬说：过去在白色恐怖的时期，党员经常同我们往来，给我讲解时事问题；现在党和非党的关系反不如从前，个人和党的关系疏远了。这是不是我们反而比过去落后了呢？我希望党能开诚布公，把我们当自己人看待，不要一天到晚把我们当贼来防；否则即使没有问题，也会发生许多问题。
    对革命有过贡献的党员，群众是从内心里尊敬的；但是有许多党员却居功自傲，看不起非党人士，甚至一些职位并不高的党员的架子也很大。朱绍文说：有些作机密工作的一般党员，说是文件上写得不清楚，常常把非党的科级干部叫去自己改，而他们却坐在一旁看报抽烟，有时甚至粗暴地加以斥责。
    希望真正发挥作用不愿坐着吃饭
    在多年的学习和工作中积累了相当丰富的知识和经验，也愿意把它们贡献给国家和人民，但是有力量无处使，这是非党的高级知识分子最感苦恼的事。这中间有些人是因为工作安排不当，没有能够充分发挥他们的所长。据朱绍文反映，国外业务局叫一些不熟悉贸易业务的人去搞贸易方面的工作，熟悉贸易业务的人去搞非贸易方面的工作。李大璋原在地方上担任的工作很重要；但自1953年调到总行后，一直作些“擦屁股”的工作。公私合营银行业务处处长陈鸣一认为，1952年公私合营银行大合并时，人员的安排是“乔太守乱点鸳鸯谱”，许多人安排的不恰当，有多年银行工作经验的人叫去点钞票和整理传票。有个专门研究经济问题的博士，也被分配作这类工作，以后又叫他改行教英文。外汇训练班教员宋乐岩说：我的工作安排一直不适当，我熟悉外汇和银行业务，但是不让我搞这方面的工作。
    还有许多人的工作虽然基本上安排适当，但是因为组织上不敢大胆地使用，没有给予他们作好工作的必要条件，也不能很好地发挥作用。郑伯彬说：现在建设社会主义，我们愿意同党员共患难，但是你们只叫我们吃饭、看书，我们很感苦闷。郑伯彬原是银行干部学校副校长，他说：我们在教学上努力联系实际，但是看不到文件和材料，不知道总行在作什么工作。我们还不如人民大学的教员，因为他们是党员，就可以列席分行行长会议，可以到各司、局收集材料，而我们反而不可以。有人批评我们教书是教条主义，可是我们怎样能够不教条主义？林凤苞是有三十多年经验的外汇专家，熟悉国外市场的情况，可是，这些年来没有让他作他最熟悉的工作。他很感慨地说：小孩子不摔几回跤，就学不会走路；我不是小孩子，可是你们却深怕我出事。时不我待，第一个五年计划都快要结束，我再经不起几个五年计划了！著名的翻译家、银行专家工作室主任吴青友等同志，也发出了同样的感叹。非党干部批评干部政策有些党员无德才却居要职
    银行的干部政策有严重的宗派主义情绪，这也是许多党外人士尖锐批评的问题之一。他们认为，衡量干部的标准有两个：一个是德，一个是才。但是有些党员既无德，又无才，却身居要职，做不好工作。有个党员的作风恶劣，文化程度很低，工作能力差，但仍然叫他作科长。据一些非党的同志反映，国外业务局党员领导干部不称职的情况相当严重。群众对某党员处长的意见很多，认为他入城七、八年，业务上还只是能应付门市。这个处有些有关业务方面的规章制度，至今还没有订出来，完全应当由党员领导人负责。
    有人说，党员领导干部在业务上是外行，但是如果他们信任专门家，或者能够深入下层听取意见，事情也好办得多。可是许多党员高傲自大，不懂装懂，工作作风极不深入。他们做计划作总结，常常是根据党员的汇报；对于下面送给他们的东西，也多是拖延不作处理。宋乐岩反映，他在外汇训练班教书，可是教学总结，却由校长和学员一起作，不让他参加。
    宗派主义还表现在干部的培养提拔上。有些非党同志认为，过去提拔干部，党员提拔得快。例如，去年工业信贷局提拔的都是党员，而有个当了好久科长、又是先进工作者的非党人士，却没有得到提拔。党要知人善任，党员要虚怀若谷
    许多非党同志在发言中，都希望党要了解知识分子的特点，既要帮助他们进行思想改造，也要充分发挥他们的长处。同时也希望党员能够克服骄傲情绪，虚心地学习非党同志的长处，大家互通有无，才能共同提高。郑伯彬和胡雄定都说，高级知识分子绝大多数是爱国的，他们在学术上有所成就，都经过一定的甘苦。因此党要大胆地信任和使用他们，不要使他们站在国家建设旁观者的立场。胡雄定认为知识分子是活的财富，如果长期不使用，他们是会退化和死亡的。林凤苞也说：现在有些研究经济问题的人，专门到清宫里查清末民初以至北洋军阀时代的市场、物价和货币的材料，而我们都是活的材料，为什么不来找我们呢？在我的业务知识和工作经验中，可能有90％的东西都过时了，但剩下来的10％的东西，也值得学习吧？你们不学习，是你们自己吃亏。不要把我们看得太低了。我愿意赶快把我的知识和经验贡献出来！
    党员大吃一惊
    感到问题严重
    对于非党同志的这些批评，许多党员都感到大吃一惊。他们原来认为，银行的统战工作虽有问题，但还不至于这样严重。因此，有些党小组最初对合作共事关系检查得不深不透，甚至觉得没有什么可检查的。等到非党同志在大会小会上提出批评以后，许多党员才从睡梦中惊醒过来，感到人民内部矛盾在机关里也很尖锐。所以对于非党同志的批评和建议，他们一般都抱着热烈欢迎和虚心听取的态度，认为非党同志的发言有很大的积极意义，给党员代表大会增添了新的气氛，对推动党内的整风很有帮助。有人说，这是给我们党敲起了警钟；有人说，参加这次党员代表大会，是等于上了一次短期训练班。有人还联系思想进行了检查。朱平说，他过去考虑组的领导时，从来也没有想到让非党同志担任。赵荣轩说：我们党内确实存在着严重的骄傲情绪，这次非党同志对我们的批评，提醒党员必须努力提高自己，才能适应新的形势的需要。
    但是从党内外的反映来看，还有一些党员、特别是一些司局长以上的党员，还没有完全从睡梦中惊醒过来，他们的发言还没有跳出公式化、概念化的圈子，问题揭发得不多，思想挖得不深。甚至个别党员司局长的发言，给人的印象是在那里表功。对于这种情况，党内和党外的许多同志都不满意。有些党外同志，批评这些党员是身在庐山不知庐山真面目。有些党外同志则认为，这是由于党员和非党员所处的地位不同，感受也不同，在党员看来不是大问题的，在非党同志看来就可能是大问题。
    党内和党外的这些意见，都及时地反映到银行党组和党委那里。它们认为，这次检查只是一个开始，党内检查得不深不透，党外也还有许多意见没有说出来。因此它们决定在整风运动中，将要继续检查党与非党的关系问题，一方面通过说服教育的方法，批判纠正党内的错误思想和情绪，同时还要继续广泛地征求党外人士的意见。
