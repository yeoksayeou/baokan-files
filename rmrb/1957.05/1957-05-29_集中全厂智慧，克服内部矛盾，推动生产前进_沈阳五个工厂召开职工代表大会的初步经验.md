    Concentrating the Wisdom of the Entire Factory, Overcoming Internal Contradictions, and Promoting Production Progress
    Preliminary Experiences from Five Factories in Shenyang in Convening Employee Representative Assemblies
    The Second Industrial Department of the CPC Shenyang Municipal Committee
    In order to implement the principle of democratic centralism in the management of industrial enterprises, attract all employees to actively participate in enterprise management, further promote their sense of ownership, and strengthen supervision of the administration, in mid-January of this year, we decided to conduct pilot work in expanding democracy in enterprise management and convening employee representative assemblies in five units in Shenyang City: the Transformer Factory, the Mining Machinery Factory, the Fan Factory, the High-Voltage Switch Factory, and the Pneumatic Tool Factory. The employee representative assemblies of the above five factories have been held one after another. We now summarize the situation of the convening of employee representative assemblies in these five pilot factories and our opinions as follows:
    The Nature, Tasks, and Specific Forms of Employee Representative Assemblies
    The practice of several factories has proven that the employee representative assembly should be the main form of promoting democracy and attracting the masses of employees to participate in management throughout the factory. It can more completely embody the principle of democratic centralism in enterprise management, can unite the centralized command of enterprise administrative leadership with the will and requirements of the masses of employees, can concentrate the wisdom of all factory employees, and can overcome and prevent the tendencies of bureaucracy, subjectivism, and detachment from the masses in enterprise management, thereby powerfully promoting the factory's production work. There have been various different views on the nature, tasks, and specific forms of the all-factory employee representative assembly, but after preliminary practice, everyone's views have become more consistent and agreed to the following principles:
    First, the employee representative assembly is a supervisory body for all factory employees to participate in enterprise management and has the power to supervise. Its main task is to ensure that the Party's and the state's guidelines, policies, laws, instructions, and plans can be correctly implemented in light of the actual situation of the enterprise, and to rationally unify the requirements of the leadership and the requirements of the masses. In this way, the employee representative assembly can not only demonstrate the role of the employee masses as masters but also will not hinder the centralized leadership of the state and higher-level economic organs. If the employee representative assembly becomes the highest authority of the entire factory, it will cause many problems, such as the relationship between the employee representative assembly and the leadership of the enterprise Party committee, as well as the relationship with higher-level management organs. The employees of these five factories did not make such a request either. If the employee representative assembly is only a consultative body, it is easy to become weak and difficult to play its supervisory role, and employees do not welcome this form.
    Second, in the spirit of ensuring the correct implementation of the state's guidelines, policies, laws, instructions, and plans, the employee representative assembly has the right to listen to and review the work reports of the factory director, relevant administrative personnel, and the trade union committee; has the right to discuss and review major economic work issues of the enterprise in production, finance, technology, planning, and other aspects; has the right to discuss and decide on the enterprise's bonus fund, welfare expenses, medical expenses, labor protection appropriations, trade union expenses, and other expense methods; has the right to reward and commend outstanding staff and departments of the enterprise; and can criticize and suggest disciplinary action to administrative departments for leaders who fail to implement the resolutions of the employee representative assembly without reason or commit serious bureaucratic errors, and can also make suggestions to higher-level leading organs to remove the factory director. In fact, these five pilot factories have not encountered the problem of suggesting the removal of the factory director.
    Since the employee representative assembly is not the highest authority of the enterprise, administrative leading cadres are not elected. We believe that it is not necessary to stipulate the election of administrative leading cadres. Because doing so, on the one hand, will increase many unnecessary troubles and even cause confusion, and on the other hand, it is easy to become a formality. From cadres to the masses, no one has made such a request.
    Third, when discussing and reviewing the above work and issues, the employee representative assembly has the right to make resolutions. The content and scope of such resolutions can include all the work discussed and reviewed by the employee representative assembly, but cannot conflict with the principles and instructions stipulated by the state leading organs and higher-level economic departments. Such resolutions are binding on enterprise leaders and all employees, and must be resolutely implemented.
    Fourth, the employee representative assembly is convened by the trade union committee under the leadership of the Party. During the meeting, the meeting is presided over by the presidium temporarily elected, and during the adjournment, the trade union committee is responsible for supervising the implementation of the assembly's resolutions. At the next assembly, the trade union committee will make a work report on the implementation of the resolutions. Therefore, there is no need to set up a special standing body for the employee representative assembly (such as a management committee, etc.). This can strengthen and fully play the role of the trade union organization and avoid overlapping institutions. From the pilot situation of the five factories, this is appropriate. Everyone has a concern that the work tasks during the convening and adjournment of the employee representative assembly are heavy, and whether the trade union organization can be competent for this responsibility. The preliminary experience of these five factories proves that this problem can be solved. Because: (1) In the process of preparing, convening, and implementing the resolutions of the assembly, the handling of some major issues is carried out under the unified leadership of the Party committee. Under the unified leadership of the Party committee, the Party, the administration, the trade union, and the Communist Youth League all share certain tasks, especially the administration and the trade union, which undertake more specific work tasks, so that the problem can be solved. (2) The so-called supervision of the trade union committee refers to the supervision of the entire trade union organization (including the various committees and groups of the trade union), which is much more powerful than a dedicated institution. (3) In the past, the role of trade union organizations in factories and enterprises was not fully发挥, and the situation of detachment from the masses in trade union work was relatively serious. But this situation can be improved. If we strengthen the allocation of leading cadres to the trade union organization, improve the democratic life of the trade union, and strengthen the Party's leadership over trade union work, this problem can be solved. The views and practices of not trying to strengthen the trade union, distrusting the trade union, and weakening the role of the trade union organization are inappropriate. (4) During the adjournment of the employee representative assembly, temporary committees and inspection teams can also be formed to check and study a certain issue to promote the implementation of the resolutions, and representatives of the employee representative assembly can be organized to carry out activities, such as organizing inspection groups to check and supervise a certain department or unit to improve its work and implement the assembly's resolutions.
    Fifth, the employee representative assembly should be held once a quarter or at least once every six months, and the representatives are permanent, elected once a year. Representatives are elected by production and work units such as workshops, work sections, and offices. Each electoral unit can replace and supplement its representatives at any time as needed.
    Sixth, the factory director is responsible to the higher level and also responsible to the employee representative assembly. When implementing the Party's guidelines, policies, higher-level instructions, and the resolutions of the employee representative assembly, and directing production and administrative work, the factory director has the right to issue orders and instructions that all employees must resolutely implement. The situation in these five factories proves that after fully promoting democracy, the centralized command of the administration can be more powerful, but it is still necessary to emphasize the centralized command power of the factory director to prevent the occurrence of weakening unified command.
    Seventh, regarding the relationship between the employee representative assembly and the trade union member representative assembly, our opinion is that it is more beneficial than harmful to combine the two into one. There are many shortcomings in maintaining two sets. If there are too many representative assemblies, they will be held repeatedly, and some contents cannot be strictly separated (such as production, technology, financial work, and cultural, life, and welfare, etc.).
    Eighth, in order to make up for the shortcomings of the all-factory employee representative assembly, it is also necessary to hold the all-employee assemblies of workshops and offices (individual workshops with excessively large scale and too many workers can convene the employee representative meetings of the workshops). The meeting period can generally be stipulated to be held once a month. The duties and tasks of the all-employee assembly of workshops and offices are mainly to ensure the implementation of the instructions and orders of higher-level organs and the factory director, as well as the resolutions of the all-factory employee representative assembly, and to discuss and review the production, technology, and financial planning and management work of the workshop.
    With the all-factory employee representative assembly, plus the employee assemblies of workshops and offices, we can more fully and powerfully organize the masses of employees to participate in the management of the enterprise and implement a very powerful mass supervision of the enterprise's production management work.
    How to Hold the Employee Representative Assembly Well?
    First, doing a good job in preparing for the convening of the employee representative assembly is the prerequisite for holding the employee representative assembly well. The key to doing a good job in preparing is to grasp the following links:
    1. Correctly determine the central topic of the employee representative assembly. The central topic of the employee representative assembly must be a central issue in the current production work of the entire factory, or a pressing and major issue that is of concern to all employees. After correctly determining the central topic, the leading ideology can be unified, and actions can be consistent.
    These five pilot factories all take the in-depth development of the movement to increase production and practice thrift to ensure the completion of the state plan as the central topic of the employee representative assembly, because this is precisely the most pressing problem that each factory needs to solve at present. In addition, there are many specific measures and some special topics around this central topic.
    The central topic, main progress, and other principled issues of the employee representative assembly are all decided by the Party committee through collective discussion, and then prepared by the Party, government, trade union, Communist Youth League, and other organizations under the unified leadership of the Party.
    2. Conscientiously do a good job in ideological preparation work among all employees. The most basic content of ideological preparation work is to carry out education on democratic centralism and the Party's mass line, education on the working class's sense of ownership, education on selecting good representatives, and education on welcoming the employee representative assembly by in-depth development of the movement to increase production and practice thrift and by doing practical actions in doing a good job. Among leading cadres at all levels, education on checking work, improving work, and improving leadership style was also carried out. Through this kind of publicity and education, all cadres and all employees have a correct understanding of convening the employee representative assembly and actively welcome and participate in the employee representative assembly. This kind of publicity and education should be carried out repeatedly and in depth. The vast majority of workers expressed excitement and enthusiasm about participating in enterprise management, but there are also different ideological obstacles among employees. On the one hand, some old workers are very moved by participating in enterprise management, but on the other hand, they are worried that young workers are not easy to lead. Some apprentices said: "Regardless of whether democratic management is democratic or not, I just want to learn technology quickly." Some people have a skeptical attitude and say: "Isn't it still up to your leaders to decide!" There are also individual workers who have extremely democratic emotions. One worker violated labor discipline, did not accept the criticism of the cadres, and said: "Democratic management is coming. See you at the employee assembly!" Many technicians have good understanding, but there are also a few people who have a skeptical attitude. Cadres are generally also active, especially the leading cadres at the factory level, and the vast majority are actively treating the convening of the employee representative assembly. However, some management cadres are afraid of being criticized, afraid that things will not be easy to handle in the future, and afraid of mass supervision. Those cadres who have more serious bureaucratic work style and are detached from the masses express nervousness. Each factory conducted ideological education in light of these different ideological understandings and different objects, and improved the ideological understanding of cadres and the broad masses of employees.
    3. Select good representatives of the employee representative assembly. It is best not to stipulate the specific conditions for being a representative when selecting representatives to avoid restricting the masses. In order to select good representatives, from the situation of the five pilot factories, attention should be paid to grasping the following principles: First, the representatives should have broadness and mass character, and should try to take care of all aspects; Second, there should be a certain control over Party members and cadres to avoid turning the employee representative assembly into a Party member meeting and a cadre meeting (Party members should generally be controlled at about one-third); Third, elections should fully promote democracy, and leaders should not nominate in advance. Taking the work section or group as a unit, according to a certain proportion of the number of people, the masses should first put forward a list of candidates. After the masses repeatedly deliberate and determine the list of candidates for the entire workshop or office unit, the election should be conducted by secret ballot at the all-employee assembly of the workshop and office (it can also be elected by work section group as a unit); Fourth, in the process of deliberating and determining candidates and electing representatives, attention should be paid to guiding the masses to appropriately criticize the candidates.
    This time, the election of representatives in several pilot factories was very serious, and it was a profound education for both the masses and the cadres. The masses did not vote for cadres with serious bureaucratic problems (such as some workshop directors and trade union branch chairmen). In some units, too many Party members were elected. The branch mobilized Party members to let the masses be representatives. On the one hand, the masses were very moved by the Party branch's approach, and on the other hand, they said: "We don't care about Party members or not. I'll vote for whoever can represent us!" The masses generally expressed satisfaction with this election of representatives, believing that "this is true democracy." The elected representatives also felt honored, and the cadres did not think that being a representative was a burden.
    4. Draft the provisional charter of the employee representative assembly. The five pilot factories have all collectively discussed and drafted the provisional charter of the employee representative assembly through the Party committee, and after repeated discussions and revisions by all the representatives of the employee representative assembly, it was finally unanimously adopted. A provisional charter is very necessary. It can institutionalize the employee representative assembly, have rules to follow, and is also a concrete education for all employees. It doesn't matter if the provisional charter is immature and imperfect, it can be revised later, and in the future, when the state has unified regulations, it will be implemented according to the state regulations.
    5. The factory leaders should prepare the assembly report. This report reflects the main items of the central topic of the assembly. This report must be made on the basis of in-depth inspection of work and in-depth analysis and research on current work problems. Not only should there be an inspection and analysis of the past and current work situation, but also a clear direction and requirements must be put forward for future work, and there must be practical and feasible specific measures as a guarantee. The work reports of the five factories were all prepared in this spirit. One factory director said: "In the past, the reports I made at the trade union member representative assembly were just perfunctory, and the report was over when it was finished. This time it is different. What I say must be done!" This is the actual situation.
    The factory director must make a main report at the employee representative assembly, because the factory director is the unified commander of the factory's administrative management. The main report of the assembly should be conveyed to all representatives and all employees before the meeting, and everyone should discuss and deliberate first to prepare opinions and submit proposals. Doing so can also promote current work. Around the main report, various special topic speeches should also be organized in advance. The determination of the special topic speech mainly depends on the needs of the central topic. The special topic speech should be interspersed with the representative speech.
    6. Do a good job in handling proposals in a timely manner. At the employee representative assemblies of these factories, the masses submitted many proposals, as many as 1,500 and as few as 550, generally more than 1,000. Many of these proposals are rationalization proposals, and mainly related to doing a good job in production work, and only a small part related to life and welfare. For example, the Mining Machinery Factory submitted a total of 1,158 proposals, which were sorted out and summarized into 437 proposals, including 115 on planning and technical management, 89 on life and welfare, 30 on wages and rewards, 34 on personnel, 27 on training and education, 42 on labor protection, 51 on each workshop, and 49 on leaders at all levels. Most of these proposals are practical and feasible. For example, among these 437 proposals, 167 should be resolved immediately, 216 belong to gradual improvement and resolution, and only 54 cannot be implemented and need to be explained. Mass proposals must be handled seriously, and each one must be carefully explained. The masses are very concerned about the handling of proposals.
    The above are the six important links in doing a good job in preparing for the convening of the employee representative assembly. These tasks are carried out in an interspersed manner. The process of carrying out these tasks is also the process of carrying out ideological education work to the masses and promoting the current production work.
    Second, after doing a good job in preparing for the assembly, we will shift to concentrating our efforts to hold the employee representative assembly well. This is a tense and decisive stage. From the situation of the five factories, in order to hold the assembly well, we must focus on the following issues:
    1. Strengthen the Party's ideological leadership of the assembly. Before the convening of the assembly and during the assembly, we must first grasp the ideological trends through the activities of the Party organization and Party members so that we can have a clear understanding. Second, we must make a calm analysis of the situations and problems that may occur or have already occurred, and take measures in a timely manner. For example, if a leading cadre has many problems in work style and the masses have great opinions, we must work with him to make him ideologically prepared to actively examine himself and humbly listen to the opinions of the masses. Third, we can also convene a preparatory meeting for the representatives to explain the basic spirit of the assembly, explain that the purpose of the assembly is to start from doing a good job, strengthening unity, affirming achievements, exposing problems, thinking of ways, and improving work. This can guide the healthy development of the assembly. However, this kind of guidance must not be simple and rigid, and must not restrict everyone's speech.
    2. Give full play to the role of the assembly presidium to strengthen the specific leadership of the assembly. The presidium should divide the work to preside over the meeting, study and revise the charter and assembly resolutions according to the opinions discussed by the representatives, answer questions, and divide the work to study other relevant special topics.
    The Party committee should not directly lead the assembly, and there is no need to establish a Party group in the presidium. Party member leading cadres should play a role in the presidium. When it is inconvenient to immediately decide on major issues in the assembly, the Party committee can be convened temporarily to discuss, and after the Party committee discusses and decides, it will be brought to the presidium for discussion, or finally discussed and decided by the representative assembly. This can not only ensure the Party's leadership of the assembly but also give full play to the role of the presidium.
    This time, the presidium of the employee representative assembly of the five pilot factories was very serious and responsible for the leadership of the assembly. If there were different opinions, they would argue. The past phenomenon of "going on stage at the meeting and going off stage after the meeting," which was just a formality and a show, did not occur in the pilot work.
    3. In the speeches at the assembly, attention should be paid to fully promoting democracy, dispelling all worries, enabling everyone to speak freely, carrying out criticism and self-criticism in the attitude of being masters, and advocating friendly debates on different opinions to distinguish right from wrong and achieve the purpose of concentrating mass wisdom. Whether this can be done is the key to the success or failure of the assembly.
    The five factories all paid attention to this issue, so the representatives rushed to speak, filled with the atmosphere of being masters of the house, criticism and self-criticism. Many people not only put forward criticisms and suggestions on the work of others but also examined the shortcomings of themselves or their units. Many representatives not only put forward sharp criticisms of the shortcomings of the current work and the bureaucratic work style of the leaders but also put forward many constructive opinions on the improvement of future work. The masses were very satisfied, and many representatives said with emotion: "This is an unprecedented new atmosphere!" "We have said what we want to say, and we are in a good mood!" Some representatives returned to the workshop, and the workers immediately surrounded him and asked, "Is the meeting going well? Have all the opinions been expressed?" The masses are very concerned about the opinions they put forward.
    From the actual situation of the five factories, most of the speeches of the masses at the assembly are correct or basically correct; the opinions that are more one-sided or have excessive demands and are not realistic are very few. Most of the correct or basically correct opinions have been adopted, and some one-sided or unrealistic opinions have been explained truthfully. The masses are also relatively satisfied with this. Some said: "This assembly is not like the past, where right and wrong are not distinguished, and there are no results; correct opinions have been supported, and leaders have also explained incorrect opinions, which has improved understanding."
    4. Conscientiously do a good job in the resolutions of the assembly. The actual situation of the five factories shows that doing a good job in the resolutions of the assembly is the focus of all representatives' attention, and the masses are very concerned about whether the resolutions of the assembly can solve the problems and whether they can incorporate the issues they care most about into the resolutions. Through the resolutions of the assembly, the central topic of the assembly, the proposals, and the speeches of the assembly are all concentrated, which is a concrete manifestation of concentrating the wisdom of the leaders and the wisdom of the masses, and is also a concrete sign of whether the assembly can solve the problems and what problems it can solve. If the resolutions of the assembly are done well, it can unify the ideological understanding and future practical actions of all representatives and all employees.
    Regarding the issue of doing a good job in the resolutions of the assembly, there are a few points that need attention:
      1. The resolutions of the assembly should mainly reflect the requirements of the central topic of the assembly. Around the requirements of the central topic, the content of the resolutions can be broader. Such resolutions are beneficial to running the factory enterprises well and will not cause harm.
      2. The resolutions should reflect relatively important issues. For all the problems that are stipulated to be solved in the resolutions, not only should there be a clear direction, but also specific requirements, measures, responsible persons, and completion time, so that they can be checked. The parties involved in the implementation of the resolutions are often afraid that the resolutions are too strict and too specific, but the masses require that they be strict and specific to prevent opportunities for "loopholes." Therefore, there are often long arguments, and it does not stop until it becomes specific.
      3. The problems that need to be solved that are written in the resolutions of the assembly must be practical and feasible. Therefore, attention should be paid to fully deliberating and studying the resolutions, not only paying attention to the opinions of ordinary representatives but also paying attention to the opinions of the departments that implement the resolutions. It is much more reliable to formally pass them after reaching a consensus.
    How to Implement the Resolutions of the Employee Representative Assembly?
    After the employee representative assembly is adjourned, we must seize the time to organize the implementation of the assembly's resolutions. The resolutions of this employee representative assembly of several pilot factories are generally centered on deepening the movement to increase production and practice thrift, establishing the atmosphere of running enterprises diligently and thriftily, doing everything possible to ensure the completion of the state plan, striving to improve work, improve work style, and overcome bureaucracy. Whether the resolutions of the assembly can be quickly implemented throughout the factory is the issue that all representatives and all employees are most concerned about. The implementation of the resolutions is not only the task of the enterprise management department but also the task of all employees. Regarding how to organize the implementation of the assembly's resolutions, from the current situation, the following points are worth noting:
    1. After the assembly is adjourned, the Party committee should immediately discuss how to ensure the implementation of the resolutions within the entire factory and formulate a plan for implementing the resolutions.
    2. The leading organizations of all aspects of the factory must act in unison and actively implement the resolutions of the assembly. The Party committee should promote the Party's branches, mobilize all Party members to ensure the implementation of the resolutions, and actively overcome the ideological obstacles of cadres and Party members, and overcome the phenomena of bureaucracy and detachment from the masses in work style with practical actions. Administrative leaders must effectively promote the work of various administrative departments through strong ideological, organizational, and business leadership, and study and adopt specific measures to implement the resolutions. This is the decisive link in ensuring the implementation of the resolutions. Because the administrative leading department bears great responsibility for the implementation of the resolutions. On the one hand, the trade union should strengthen contact with the representatives, strengthen contact with the research and inspection groups entrusted by the assembly, and guide their activities; on the other hand, it should ensure the implementation of the assembly's resolutions through the trade union organization, through the activities of various work committees and activists of the trade union, and through organizing socialist competitions. The Communist Youth League should ensure the implementation of the resolutions by educating the members and organizing the activities of the members and youth.
      3. Taking the implementation of the assembly's resolutions as the central requirement, and on the basis of fully preparing the work, and in light of the situation of the unit, convene the employee assemblies of each workshop and office to convey and implement them. Make it known to everyone among all employees, and mobilize all employees to actively act in the attitude of being masters of the house, so that the implementation of the resolutions can have a broad and solid mass base.
      4. Give full play to the role of the employee representative assembly. A good form of giving play to the role of the representatives of the employee representative assembly is to organize representative inspection groups. Organizing representative inspections is an effective method for the masses to supervise the implementation of the resolutions. Under the unified leadership of the Party committee, the Transformer Factory specifically formed representative inspection groups with different business natures under the specific responsibility of the trade union to check and supervise the implementation of the resolutions. First, determine the purpose, requirements, and methods of the inspection. Then, carry out inspection activities: listen to the report of the inspected unit on the implementation of the resolutions; convene small-scale discussions and conduct individual conversations with the masses to understand and listen to the opinions of the masses and find out the existing problems; report the inspection results at a certain meeting of the inspected unit, affirm the achievements and point out the problems truthfully, and make suggestions.
    The inspection activities of the representative group have a great effect and a good effect. It not only promoted the implementation of the resolutions but also improved the ideological understanding of the employees. For example, the inspection of the casting workshop, general affairs welfare, and sanitation units of the Transformer Factory is a good example. The inspection group found in the casting workshop that the original resolution required the scrap rate of castings in the workshop to be stabilized below 7%, but in fact, it has been reduced to 2.56% since February, which is a very good achievement. Based on the problems found in the inspection, the inspection group also suggested that the casting workshop improve the methods for implementing the process of cast iron, strengthen the control of furnace front tests and the research on sand mold tests, which will play a certain role in improving the quality of the casting workshop. When inspecting the general affairs welfare and sanitation departments, it was found that these units have greatly improved their work after implementing the resolutions, such as setting up a boiling water station, building toilets, establishing a mass food management committee, improving the sanitation and service attitude of the canteen, and the food has also changed from cold to hot, and so on. Therefore, the general affairs department felt that it has changed from being dissatisfied by the masses to being supported by the masses. The head of the general affairs section said: "The inspection group has promoted our work. The inspection group can objectively understand our work achievements and difficulties. In the future, the work will be better carried out. At the same time, it has also educated and inspired us to quickly overcome the bureaucratic work style." The representatives who participated in the inspection also felt that it was a great honor to participate in the inspection, and inspecting others also educated themselves, and it was also a help to their work.

    集中全厂智慧，克服内部矛盾，推动生产前进
    沈阳五个工厂召开职工代表大会的初步经验
    中共沈阳市委第二工业部
    为了在工业企业管理工作中贯彻执行民主集中制的原则，吸引全体职工积极参加企业管理，进一步发扬他们的主人翁责任感，加强对行政的监督，今年1月中旬，我们确定了在沈阳市的变压器厂、矿山机器厂、扇风机厂、高压开关厂和风动工具厂等五个单位进行了扩大企业管理方面的民主、召开职工代表大会的试点工作。上述五个厂的职工代表大会均已先后开过。现在将这五个试点厂召开职工代表大会的情况和我们的意见综述如下：
    职工代表大会的性质、任务和具体形式
    几个厂的实践证明，职工代表大会应当是在全厂范围内发扬民主，吸引职工群众参加管理的主要形式。它能够比较完善地体现企业管理上的民主集中制的原则，能够把企业行政领导的集中指挥和职工群众的意志和要求统一起来，能够集中全厂职工的智慧，能够克服与防止企业管理工作中的官僚主义、主观主义和脱离群众的倾向，从而强有力地推动全厂的生产工作。关于全厂职工代表大会的性质，任务和具体形式等问题，曾经有过各种不同的看法，但经过初步实践以后，大家的看法便趋于一致，同意了下列一些原则：
    第一、职工代表大会是全厂职工参加企业管理和有权力的监督机关。它的任务主要是保证党和国家的方针、政策、法令、指示、计划能够结合本企业的实际情况正确地贯彻执行，并把领导的要求和群众的要求合理地统一起来。这样，职工代表大会既能表现出职工群众主人翁的作用，也不会妨碍国家和上级经济机关的集中领导。如果职工代表大会成为全厂的最高权力机关，则会引起很多问题，如职工代表大会与企业党委领导的关系以及与上级管理机关的关系等等。这五个厂的职工们也并没有提出这种要求。如果职工代表大会仅仅是谘询机关，则易陷于软弱无力，很难发挥它的监督作用，职工也不欢迎这种形式。
    第二、职工代表大会在保证国家的方针、政策、法令、指示、计划正确贯彻执行的精神下，有权听取和审查厂长、有关行政负责人员和工会委员会的工作报告；有权讨论和审查本企业的生产、财务、技术、计划以及其他方面的重大的经济工作问题，有权讨论和决定企业奖励基金、福利费、医药费、劳动保护拨款、工会经费及其他的经费开支办法；有权奖励与表扬本企业优秀的工作人员和部门；对无故不执行职工代表大会决议和犯有严重官僚主义错误的领导人员可以提出批评和建议行政部门给以处分，并且可以向上级领导机关提出撤换厂长的建议。实际上这五个试点厂都没有遇到建议撤换厂长的问题。
    由于职工代表大会不是企业最高权力机关，所以对行政领导干部不进行选举。我们认为没有必要规定选举行政领导干部。因为这样做，一方面会增加很多不必要的麻烦，甚至造成混乱，另一方面也容易流于形式。从干部到群众都没有提出这种要求。
    第三、职工代表大会在讨论和审查上述工作和问题的时候，有权作出决议。这种决议的内容和范围，可以包括职工代表大会所讨论审查的各项工作，但不能与国家领导机关和上级经济部门所规定的原则和指示相抵触。这种决议对企业领导者和全体职工都有约束力，都必须坚决贯彻执行。
    第四、职工代表大会在党的领导下由工会委员会负责召集，在开会期间由临时选出的主席团主持会议，在闭会期间由工会委员会负责监督大会决议的贯彻执行，在下届大会上，由工会委员会作监督决议贯彻执行情况的工作报告。因之，不再设立职工代表大会的专门的常设机构（如管理委员会等），这样，可以加强和充分发挥工会组织的作用，并且避免机构重叠。从五个厂试点的情况看来，这样做是适当的。大家有一个顾虑，就是认为在召开职工代表大会和闭会期间的工作任务都是繁重的，工会组织是否能够胜任这个责任。这五个厂的初步经验证明，这个问题是可以解决的。因为：（一）在大会的准备、召开和决议的贯彻执行过程中，对于一些重大问题的处理，都是在党委的统一领导下进行的。在党委的统一领导下，党、行政、工会、团都分工担负一定的任务，尤其是行政和工会分别担负着更多的具体工作任务，这样就能够解决问题。（二）所谓工会委员会的监督，是指整个工会组织（包括工会的各种委员会和小组）的监督，这比一个专设机构的力量要大得多。（三）工厂企业中工会组织的作用过去没有充分发挥，在工会工作中脱离群众的情况较为严重。但这种情况是可以改进的，如果加强对工会组织的领导干部的配备，健全工会的民主生活，加强党对工会工作的领导，这一问题就可以解决。那种不设法加强工会，不信任工会和削弱工会组织作用的观点和作法是不妥当的。（四）在职工代表大会闭会期间，为了检查和研究某一个问题，还可以组成临时的委员会和检查组，以推动决议的贯彻执行，可以组织职工代表大会的代表进行活动，如组织视察组，以检查督促某一部门、单位改进工作，贯彻执行大会决议。
    第五、职工代表大会一季或至少半年开会一次，代表为常任制，一年选一次。代表由车间、工段、科室等生产、工作单位选出，各选举单位根据需要可以随时撤换和增补本单位的代表。
    第六、厂长对上级负责，同时对职工代表大会负责。厂长在贯彻执行党的方针、政策、上级指示和职工代表大会决议，指挥生产行政工作的时候，有权发布命令和指示全体职工必须坚决贯彻执行。这五个厂的情况证明，在充分发扬民主以后，行政的集中指挥就能更加有力，但是把厂长的集中指挥权力强调一下还是必要的，以防止削弱统一指挥现象的发生。
    第七、关于职工代表大会与工会会员代表大会的关系问题，我们的意见是两者合而为一利多弊少。保持两套的缺点很多，如果代表大会太多，开起来重复，有些内容又不能严格分开（如生产、技术、财务工作及文化、生活福利等）。
    第八、为了弥补全厂职工代表大会的不足，还要开好车间、科室的全体职工大会（个别规模过大、工人过多的车间可以召开车间的职工代表会议）。会期一般可以规定一个月召开一次。车间、科室全体职工大会的职务、任务，主要是保证上级机关和厂长的指示命令以及全厂职工代表大会决议的贯彻执行，讨论审查本车间的生产、技术、财务计划管理工作等问题。
    有了全厂的职工代表大会，再加上车间、科室的职工大会，就能更加充分有力地组织职工群众参加企业的管理工作，对企业的生产管理工作实行十分有力的群众性的监督。
    怎样开好职工代表大会？
    第一、做好召开职工代表大会的准备工作，是开好职工代表大会的前提。做好准备工作主要是要抓住以下几个环节：
    一、正确地确定职工代表大会的中心议题。职工代表大会的中心议题必须是当前全厂生产工作中的一个中心问题，或是一个迫切的重大的并为全体职工所关切的问题。在正确地确定了中心议题之后，领导思想就能统一起来，行动一致起来。
    这五个试点厂都是以深入开展增产节约运动保证完成国家计划为职工代表大会的中心议题，因为这正是各厂目前要解决的一个最迫切的问题。另外，围绕着这个中心议题还有很多具体措施和一些专题。
    职工代表大会的中心议题、主要进程和其他一些带有原则性的问题，都是经党委集体讨论决定，然后在党的统一领导下由党、政、工、团等组织分工进行准备的。
    二、认真在全体职工中做好思想准备工作。思想准备工作的最基本的内容就是通过广泛宣传职工代表大会的性质、职责、任务等，来进行民主集中制和党的群众路线的教育，进行工人阶级主人翁的教育，进行选好代表的教育，进行以深入开展增产节约运动和以做好工作的实际行动来迎接职工代表大会的教育。在各级领导干部中，还进行了检查工作，改进工作，改进领导作风的教育。通过这种宣传教育，使全体干部和全体职工对召开职工代表大会具有正确的认识，并以积极的行动来迎接和参加职工代表大会。这种宣传教育要反复深入进行。绝大多数工人对参加企业管理都表示兴奋和积极，但在职工中也存在着不同的思想障碍。有些老工人一方面对参加企业管理很受感动，一方面又顾虑到青年工人不好领导。有些徒工表示：“不管民主管理不民主管理，我就是赶快学好技术”。有些人抱着怀疑的态度说：“还不是你们领导说了算！”还有个别工人有极端民主的情绪，有一个工人违犯了劳动纪律，不接受干部的批评，并且说：“要民主管理了。职工大会上再见！”技术人员有很多人认识是好的，但也有少数人抱着怀疑的态度。干部一般也是积极的，特别是厂一级的领导干部，绝大多数都积极对待职工代表大会的召开。但也有一部分管理干部怕受批评，怕今后事情不好办，怕群众监督。那些官僚主义作风脱离群众比较严重的干部则表示情绪紧张。各厂针对这些不同的思想认识和不同的对象，进行了思想教育，提高了干部和广大职工的思想认识。
    三、选好职工代表大会的代表。在选代表时最好不要规定当代表的具体条件，以免群众受拘束。为了选好代表，从五个试点厂的情况来看，应该注意掌握以下几个原则：第一、代表要具有广泛性和群众性，要尽量照顾到各个方面；第二、对党员和干部要有一定的控制，避免把职工代表大会变成党员会和干部会（党员一般以控制在三分之一左右为宜）；第三、选举要充分发扬民主，领导事先不提名，以工段或小组为单位，按照一定的人数比例，先由群众提出候选名单，经过群众再三酝酿确定全车间或科室单位的候选名单后，在车间和科室的全体职工大会上以无记名投票进行选举（也可以按工段小组为单位进行选举）；第四、在酝酿确定候选人和选举代表的过程中，要注意引导群众对候选人适当地开展批评。
    这次几个试点厂对代表的选举都十分认真，无论对群众和干部都是一次深刻的教育。群众对官僚主义毛病严重的干部（如有的车间主任、工会支会主席等）一票也不投。有的单位党员选上的多了，支部动员党员要让给群众当代表，群众一面对党支部这种做法很感动，一面又说：“我们不管党员不党员，谁能代表我们我就选谁！”群众对这次代表的选举普遍表示满意，认为
  “这才真民主”，被选上的代表也觉得光荣，干部也不认为当代表是负担了。
    四、拟订职工代表大会的暂行章程。五个试点厂都经过党委集体讨论拟定了职工代表大会的暂行章程，并且经过职工代表大会全体代表的反复讨论、修改，最后一致通过。有一个暂行章程是十分必要的，它可以使职工代表大会制度化，有章可循，对全体职工也是一个具体的教育。暂行章程不成熟不完善也不要紧，以后还可以修改，将来国家有了统一规定再按国家规定执行。
    五、厂的领导者要准备好大会报告。这个报告体现大会中心议题的主要项目。这一报告必须是在深入检查工作和对当前工作问题进行深刻分析研究的基础上作出的。不但要对过去和目前的工作情况有检查，有分析，对今后的工作也必须提出明确的方向和要求，并且要有切实可行的具体措施作保证。五个厂的工作报告都是本着这种精神准备的。有一个厂长说：“过去我在工会会员代表大会上作的报告是随便应付一下，报告完了就完了，这次就不同了，说了就得做！”这是实际情况。
    在职工代表大会上厂长一定要做主要报告，因为厂长是工厂行政管理的统一指挥者。大会的主要报告最好在会前就传达给全体代表和全体职工，先让大家讨论酝酿，以便准备意见，提出提案。这样做也可以推动当前工作。围绕着主要报告，还应事先组织各种专题发言。专题发言的确定主要是看中心议题的需要。专题发言要和代表发言穿插起来进行。
    六、及时做好提案工作。这几个厂的职工代表大会，群众提案都很多，多的达一千五百多条，少的也有五百五十多条，一般都在千条以上。这些提案很多都是合理化建议，而且主要是有关搞好生产工作的，属于生活福利的只占一小部分。如矿山机器厂共提了一千一百五十八条，经过整理归纳为四百三十七条，其中有关计划、技术管理的一百一十五条，生活福利的八十九条，工资奖励的三十条，人事方面的三十四条，培养教育的二十七条，劳动保护的四十二条，对各车间的五十一条，对各级领导的四十九条。这些提案绝大部分都是切实可行的。如在这四百三十七条提案中，应该立即解决的有一百六十七条，属于逐步改进解决的有二百一十六条，只有五十四条是不能执行，需要解释的。对群众提案必须严肃处理，条条认真交代。群众对提案的处理是十分关切的。
    上面就是做好召开职工代表大会准备工作的六个重要环节。这些工作是互相穿插进行的。进行这些工作的过程，同时就是向群众进行思想教育工作和推动当前生产工作的过程。
    第二、做好大会的准备工作之后，就转到集中力量开好职工代表大会。这是紧张的、决定性的阶段。从五个厂的情况来看，为了开好大会，就要着重注意下面几个问题：
    一、要加强党对大会的思想领导。在召开大会之前及在大会进行的过程中，首先要通过党组织和党员的活动，掌握住思想动向，以便心中有数。其次，对可能出现或者已经出现的情况和问题，要作冷静的分析，并且适时地采取措施。如有的领导干部在作风上毛病多，群众意见大，就要对他进行工作，让他有思想准备，主动检查自己，虚心听取群众意见。再其次，还可以召集代表开预备会，说明大会的基本精神，说明大会的目的是从搞好工作、加强团结出发，要肯定成绩、揭发问题、想出办法、改进工作。这样可以引导大会健康地发展。但这种引导绝不能简单生硬，不能使大家的发言受到拘束。
    二、要充分发挥大会主席团的作用，以加强大会的具体领导。主席团要分工主持会议，根据代表讨论的意见研究修改简章与大会决议，解答问题，分工研究其他有关专题等。
    党委不要直接出面领导大会，也不必在主席团中成立党组，党员领导干部要在主席团中起作用。对大会中的重大问题不便立即决定时，可以临时召开党委会讨论，在党委会讨论决定后，再拿到主席团讨论，或最后经过代表大会讨论决定。这样既能保证党对大会的领导，又能充分发挥主席团的作用。
    这次五个试点厂职工代表大会的主席团，对于大会的领导都很认真负责，有不同意见就争论。过去的那种“开会上台，散会下台”，只是走形式、摆样子的现象，在试点工作中没有发生。
    三、在大会发言中要注意做到充分发扬民主，打消一切顾虑，使大家能够畅所欲言，以主人翁的姿态开展批评和自我批评，提倡善意的对于不同意见的争论，以辨明是非，达到集中群众智慧的目的。是否能够做到这一点，是大会成败的关键。
    五个工厂都注意了这个问题，因而代表都争先发言，充满了当家做主，批评与自我批评的气氛。有不少人不但对别人的工作提出了批评和建议，对自己或本单位的缺点也进行了检查。很多代表不仅对当前工作的缺点和领导的官僚主义作风提出了尖锐的批评，而且对今后工作的改进也提出了很多建设性的意见。群众感到非常满意，很多代表感动地说：“这是前所未有的新风气！”“我们要说的话都说出来了，思想愉快了！”有的代表回到车间，工人立刻把他包围起来，问“会开的好不好？意见都讲了吗？”群众非常关心自己提出的意见。
    从五个厂的实际情况来看，群众在大会上的发言，绝大部分都是正确的或者基本上正确的；比较片面，或者要求过高不切合实际的意见是极少数。对于正确或基本上正确的意见，绝大多数都被采纳了，对于某些片面或者不符合实际的意见，已实事求是地进行了解释说明。群众对这一点也比较满意，有的说：“这次大会不像过去那样是非不分，没有结果；正确的意见得到了支持，不正确的意见领导上也作了解释，提高了认识。”
    四、切实做好大会的决议。五个厂的实际情况表明，做好大会决议是全体代表专心致意的焦点，群众十分关心大会决议是否能够解决问题，是否能够把自己最关心的问题纳入到决议中去。通过大会决议，把大会的中心议题、提案和大会发言都集中起来，这是把领导的智慧和群众的智慧集中起来的具体表现，也是大会是否能够解决问题和解决那些问题的具体标志。大会的决议做得好，就能统一全体代表、全体职工的思想认识和今后的实际行动。
    关于做好大会决议问题，有这样几点需要注意：
      1、大会决议主要应该体现大会中心议题的要求，围绕着中心议题的要求，决议的内容可以广泛一些。这样的决议对办好工厂企业有利，不会带来损害。
      2、决议所体现的应该是比较重大的问题。凡是决议上规定要解决的问题，不但要有明确的方向，而且要有具体要求，有措施，有负责人，有完成时间，这样就可以检查。执行决议的当事人，往往怕决议规定得太严格、太具体，但是群众则要求规定得严格、具体，不给“钻空子”的机会。因此，常争论很长时间，不达到具体化不止。
      3、写在大会决议上要加以解决的问题，一定要切实可行。因此，对于决议要注意充分酝酿和研究，不但要重视一般代表的意见，也要重视执行决议部门的意见。这样取得一致意见之后再正式通过，就可靠得多了。
    如何贯彻执行职工代表大会决议？
    在职工代表大会闭幕后，就要抓紧组织大会决议的贯彻执行。这次几个试点厂职工代表大会的决议，一般都是以深入开展增产节约运动，树立勤俭办企业的风气，想尽一切办法保证完成国家计划，努力改进工作、改进作风、克服官僚主义为中心内容。大会决议能否迅速在全厂贯彻执行是全体代表和全体职工最关心的问题。决议的贯彻执行，不单是企业管理部门的任务，也是全体职工的任务。关于如何组织大会决议的贯彻，从目前的情况看来，下列几点是值得注意的：
    一、在大会闭幕后，党委应该立即讨论如何在全厂范围内保证决议的贯彻执行，并且要制定出贯彻执行决议的规划。
    二、厂的各方面的领导组织要一致行动起来，积极贯彻执行大会决议。党委应该推动党的支部，动员全体党员保证决议的贯彻执行，积极克服干部、党员的思想障碍，以实际行动克服工作作风上的官僚主义和脱离群众的现象。行政领导者要切实地通过强有力的思想、组织和业务的领导，把各个行政部门的工作推动起来，研究和采取贯彻执行决议的具体措施。这是保证决议贯彻执行的具有决定性的环节。因为行政领导部门对决议的贯彻执行担负着极大的责任。工会一方面要加强与代表的联系，加强与各个受大会委托的研究与检查组的联系，并且指导他们的活动；另一方面要通过工会组织，通过工会各种工作委员会和积极分子的活动，通过组织社会主义竞赛，来保证大会决议的贯彻执行。团委应该通过对团员的教育和组织团员与青年的活动，保证决议的贯彻执行。
      三、以贯彻大会决议为中心要求，在充分做好准备工作的基础上，结合本单位的情况，召开各车间、科室的职工大会进行传达贯彻。在全体职工中作到人人皆知，发动全体职工都以主人翁的态度积极行动起来，这样才能使决议的贯彻执行有广泛坚实的群众基础。
      四、要充分发挥职工代表大会的作用。发挥职工代表大会代表作用的一个很好的形式就是组织代表视察小组。组织代表视察是发挥群众监督决议贯彻执行的有效方法。变压器厂在党委统一领导下，由工会具体负责组成了不同业务性质的代表视察小组，检查并监督决议的贯彻执行。首先要确定视察的目的，要求和方法。然后就展开视察活动：听取被视察单位贯彻执行决议情况的报告；召集小型座谈和深入群众进行个别谈话了解，听取群众意见，发现存在的问题；把视察结果在被视察单位的一定会议上作报告，实事求是地肯定成绩和指出问题，并且提出建议。
    代表小组的视察活动，作用很大，效果很好。不仅推动了决议的贯彻执行，也提高了职工的思想认识。如变压器厂对铸造车间、总务福利、卫生等单位的视察就是一个很好的例子。视察小组在铸造车间发现原来决议要求该车间铸件废品率要稳定在7％以下，而从2月份以来实际已降低到2.56％，成绩很好。视察小组根据视察中发现的问题，还建议铸造车间把铸铁贯彻执行工艺的办法健全起来，加强炉前试验控制与砂型试验研究等，这对铸造车间改进质量将起一定作用。在视察总务福利、卫生部门时，发现这些单位在贯彻执行决议后工作有很大改进，如设立开水站，修建厕所，成立群众性伙食管理委员会，改进了食堂卫生和服务态度，饭菜也由凉变热了，等等。因此，总务部门感到由群众不满意变到群众拥护了。总务科长说：“视察小组推动了我们的工作，视察小组能客观地了解我们的工作成绩和困难，今后工作更好开展了。同时也教育和启发了我们迅速克服官僚主义作风。”参加视察的代表也都感到参加视察很光荣，视察人家也教育了自己，对自己的工作也是个帮助。
