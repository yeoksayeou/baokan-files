Xinhua News Agency, 19th: Extraordinary cold is assailing the long night of the Antarctic region, but the scientific research personnel from various countries stationed in Antarctica have not relaxed their observation and research work for a moment.

    The Soviet Vostok Station meteorological station has long used radiosondes to measure atmospheric conditions. Recently, the observation station sent out a notable piece of news: On May 9th, Vostok Station recorded a new cold record: a temperature of minus 70.1 degrees Celsius, more than two degrees lower than the world's cold record to date (sixty-five years ago, Verkhoyansk in Yakutia, Siberia, recorded a minimum temperature of minus 68 degrees Celsius). According to Tauber, the leader of the Vostok Station meteorological station, it is predicted that by August, the coldest month in Antarctica, Vostok Station may encounter a severe cold of minus 80 degrees Celsius.

    In such a harsh climate, aircraft can no longer land at Vostok Station, so researchers at the scientific station must be supplied by air drop. A Soviet plane recently flew over Antarctica for seven hours carrying supplies, scientific research personnel and instruments, not only completing the air drop mission, but also discovering a strange phenomenon: At 360 meters above Vostok Station, they measured an air temperature of minus 37 degrees Celsius, a difference of more than 30 degrees Celsius from the station's temperature.

    Soviet scientists are in frequent contact and cooperation with their foreign counterparts. Currently, they are working with Carter, the American representative and meteorologist at Vostok Station, to draw up a general map that can analyze the atmosphere and predict the climate. Members of the Soviet expedition also exchanged data on ionospheric research with members of the French and Australian expeditions. Soviet scientists at Vostok Station often have radio conversations with scientists at the French research station in Antarctica on issues related to Antarctic exploration.

    Not long ago, a high-grade manganese mine was discovered near an American scientific outpost on the Antarctic coast. This type of manganese ore is rare in the world. American geologist Mesang said that the manganese ore found in Antarctica itself may not have commercial value, but it shows that the region is worth exploring.

    The British Royal Society has recently sent an expedition to Antarctica to establish a permanent base and will cooperate with the British expedition led by Fuchs, which is already in Antarctica, to complete the feat of traversing Antarctica.

    Recently, interesting news has been circulating in the New Zealand expedition at the Scott Base in Antarctica: Dr. Marsh of this expedition made a long-distance call to relatives near Shrewsbury in the United Kingdom, and the call was of good quality. The distance of the phone call is said to be more than 16,000 miles, making it the longest long-distance phone call in the world to date.

### 各国科学家探索南极奥秘在零下七十度中坚持工作

    各国科学家探索南极奥秘在零下七十度中坚持工作
    新华社19日讯　异常的严寒正在侵袭漫漫长夜的南极地区，坚守南极的各国科学考察人员一刻也没有放松他们的观测和考察工作。
    苏联和平村气象台长期以来一直用无线电探空仪测量大气情况。最近，观测站传出了一个引人注意的消息：5月9日，东方一号科学站记录了一个寒冷的新纪录：气温达摄氏零下七十点一度，比到目前为止的世界寒冷纪录还要低两度多（六十五年前在西伯利亚雅库季亚的维尔霍扬斯克曾经纪录过摄氏零下六十八度的最低气温）。据和平村气象台领导人塔乌别尔预测，到南极大陆最冷的8月份的时候，东方一号科学站还可能要遇到摄氏零下八十度的严寒。
    在这样酷寒的气候中，飞机已经不能在东方一号科学站降落，因此必须用空投办法接济科学站的研究人员。和平村的一架飞机最近载着物资、科学研究人员和仪器在南极的上空飞行了七个小时，不但完成了空投的任务，研究人员还发现了一个奇怪的现象：他们在东方一号科学站上空三百六十公尺的地方测量空气的温度是摄氏零下三十七度，和科学站的温度相差达摄氏三十度以上。
    苏联的科学家们正在同外国同行们进行频繁的接触和合作。目前，他们正在和美国在和平村的代表、气象学家卡特拉特一道绘制可以分析大气和预测气候的概要图。苏联考察队的队员还和法国、澳大利亚考察队的队员交换了有关电离层研究的资料。和平村的苏联科学家同法国在南极的考察站的科学家之间，还常常就有关南极考察的一些问题进行无线电谈话。
    不久前，建立在南极海岸边的一个美国科学前哨站附近发现了一处高级锰矿。这种锰矿在世界还很少见。美国地质学家梅桑说，在南极发现的锰矿本身可能没有商业上的价值，但是却表明这个地区是很值得勘探的。
    英国皇家学会最近已经派出一个探险队到南极去建立一个永久性的基地，并且将要和已经在南极的英国福克斯率领的考察队合作，完成横越南极的壮举。
    最近在南极斯科特基地的新西兰考察队里，流传着一件很有趣的新闻，这个考察队的医生马尔希和远在英国施留斯柏雷附近的亲戚通了长途电话，通话情况良好。电话传递的路程约达一万六千多英里。据说，这是到目前为止的世界上路程最长的长途电话。
