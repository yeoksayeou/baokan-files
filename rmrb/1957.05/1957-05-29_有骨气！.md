    Backbone!
    Zhang Yanhua, General Store of International Bookstore
    Brave and respectable Taiwanese brothers, when I read the news published in the People's Daily entitled "Anti-American Demonstrations Erupt in Taipei," my heart was so stirred that I could not remain calm for a moment. Your indignant act of smashing the American embassy, unable to bear the unreasonable tyranny of the US military authorities stationed in Taiwan, was truly satisfying! What you did showed backbone, you vented the anger of the Taiwan compatriots who have been humiliated, and you are worthy of being good sons and daughters of the motherland! All the Chinese people will extend their deep condolences and concern to you!
    Taiwan is an inseparable part of China's territory, but the Chiang Kai-shek clique condones American bandits running rampant and lawlessly in Taiwan. The deep grievances of Zang Da Erzi have not been redressed, the incident of Shen Chong being defiled by American soldiers is still fresh in our minds, and American bandits have again brutally harmed our kind Taiwanese compatriot - Liu Ziran; while the murderer Reynolds is still at large. New hatred has been added to the old grievances, and this blood debt will be repaid by the American bandits with blood sooner or later!
    Wait, brothers in Taiwan, the final victory will always belong to the people who fight for freedom! The invaders will sooner or later be driven out of the historical stage of mankind! Let the Taiwan compatriots and the people of the motherland work together to liberate Taiwan!

    有骨气！
    国际书店总店　张延华
    勇敢可敬的台湾弟兄们，当我读到人民日报刊登的题为“台北爆发反美大示威”的消息时，我的内心激动得一刻也不能安静。你们为抗议驻台湾美军当局的无理跋扈，忍无可忍地捣毁美国大使馆的激愤举动，是痛快淋漓的！你们做的有骨气，你们为受屈辱的台湾同胞出了气，你们不愧是祖国人民的好儿女！全中国人民都会向你们致以深切的慰问和关怀！
    台湾是中国的不可分割的领土，但是蒋介石集团却纵容美国强盗在台湾横行霸道，无法无天。臧大二子的深冤未伸，沈崇被美国兵污辱的事件还记忆犹新，美国强盗又在台湾惨害了我们善良的台湾同胞——刘自然；而杀人的凶犯雷诺却逍遥法外。在旧恨中又添了新仇，这笔血债迟早要美国强盗用血来偿还！
    等着吧，台湾的弟兄们，最后胜利是永远属于为争取自由而斗争的人民！侵略者迟早会被驱出人类的历史舞台！让台湾同胞和祖国人民一道协力为解放台湾而努力！
