Kunming, May 23 (By our reporter) - Yesterday afternoon, the United Front Work Department of the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China invited 28 heads of local organizations of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, China Democratic League, China National Democratic Construction Association, China Association for Promoting Democracy, and the Jiusan Society to hold a symposium on the relationship between the Party and intellectuals.

Du Fen, vice chairman of the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, said: "When I went to Beijing, I felt that the scientific workers there were very enthusiastic. The central leaders were very busy, but they still often talked with them. But in Yunnan, the doors are heavily guarded! In terms of party-masses relations, non-Party members have positions but no power. In the past, at Yunnan University, I played four roles at meetings: announcing the start of the meeting, inviting everyone to speak, inviting the Party committee to summarize, and announcing the end of the meeting. Now, at Kunming Hospital, I proactively requested to participate in the Party committee meetings, so that I have a general idea of what's going on in my mind first, which makes things easier."

Cun Shusheng, chairman of the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, said that the distance between Party members and non-Party members is greater at lower levels. Why is this phenomenon occurring? I think the times are being misunderstood. In the early days of liberation, we engaged in class struggle. People from the old society all had problems with their positions, and giving them power would not benefit the people. But now we are engaged in socialist construction. We have been studying Premier Zhou's report on the intellectuals issue and the Party's policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" enthusiastically, but it seems that the Party is not paying as much attention to it.

Qin Zan, convener of the Kunming Municipal Preparatory Committee of the Jiusan Society, said: "The Party's senior cadres attach importance to the policy of 'long-term coexistence and mutual supervision,' but middle and primary-level cadres are a problem. For example, the Jiusan Society sent people to Gejiu to work three times, but some people still didn't understand what the Jiusan Society does. Someone asked, 'Are you a senior cooperative or a primary cooperative?' They treated us as an agricultural cooperative. I think Party members should at least understand a few democratic parties in China. It is often said that intellectuals don't care about politics, but if Party members don't even know this basic political knowledge, they can be considered out of touch with politics. In addition, some engineering and technical personnel are currently asking, 'Are we senior intellectuals?' In factories and mines, if an accident occurs, the political history of the engineering and technical personnel is investigated; if there are achievements, they are attributed to others. Currently, the engineering and technical field seems to be further away from the Party than the cultural and educational field."

Gong Zizhi, chairman of the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, said that there are currently "three mutuals" between the Party and non-Party democratic figures: mutual non-interference, mutual respect, and mutual silence. How to tear down the walls and fill the gaps is the responsibility of both sides, and Communist Party members should be more proactive. Most intellectuals have made progress, and the role of intellectuals should be re-evaluated. My understanding of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" is to not treat each other as outsiders. In the past, there was more or less a phenomenon of "red first, then expert" or "red is more important than expert," which is the lingering influence of class struggle. In the future, I wonder if the Party can emphasize both "red and expert" for intellectuals, and then require non-Party intellectuals to "advance in both red and expert."

Qin Shuzhen, convener of the Kunming Preparatory Work Group of the China Association for Promoting Democracy and principal of the Teachers College Affiliated Middle School, said that in schools, everything is "Party, Youth League, Trade Union, Administration," and democratic parties "play no role." But when there is a problem, it's always, "What are you democratic parties doing?" In administrative work, I have a position but no power. Sometimes, some work is not done through administration, and the Party directly assigns it to the Youth League.

Yang Ming, vice chairman of the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League and deputy director of the Provincial Department of Culture, analyzed the root causes of sectarianism within the Party: (1) Historically, there is still a mentality of being in a state of war, wartime systems, and peasant consciousness; (2) There are too many new Party members who have not been trained enough, and many come from the countryside and the army, and they do not understand the work of intellectuals; (3) Because it is the ruling party, some people have developed a sense of political superiority. Because of the above reasons, it is manifested in schools as a simple political viewpoint, personnel cadres not understanding the business, and using the "Revolutionary University" method to grasp cadre materials, and not seeing the enthusiasm of living people today.

    云南各民主党派地方组织负责人在省委统战部召开的座谈会上
    批评党对知识分子的宗派主义情绪
    本报昆明23日电　昨日下午，中共云南省委统战部邀请民革、民盟、民建、民主促进会、九三学社地方组织的负责人共二十八人，就党与知识分子的关系问题举行座谈。
    民盟省委副主任委员杜棻说：我到北京，感到那里的科学工作者劲头很足，中央的领导同志很忙，还经常和他们谈谈，而云南，门禁森严！在党群关系上，党外人士有职无权。从前在云大，开会时我起四点作用：宣布开会，请大家发言，请党委总结，宣布散会。现在在昆明医院，我主动要求参加党委会议，于是什么事心里先有个底，就好办多了。
    民盟省委主任委员寸树声说，党与非党人士的距离，越是下级，距离越大。为什么造成这样的现象？我认为是把时代搞错了。解放初期搞阶级斗争，旧社会来的人，立场都有问题，有权了对人民没有好处，但是现在是搞社会主义建设，周总理关于知识分子问题的报告，以及党的“长期共存、互相监督”的政策，我们学习得热火朝天，而党内似乎不那么重视。
    九三学社昆明市筹委会召集人秦瓒说：党的高级干部对“长期共存、互相监督”的政策是重视的，但中级和初级干部就成问题了。如九三学社三次派人去个旧工作，还是有人不了解九三学社是干什么的。有人问：“你们是高级社还是初级社？”把我们当成农业社了。我认为党员至少对中国有几个民主党派要了解一下。常说知识分子不问政治，但是党员连这点政治常识都不知道，也可算是脱离政治了。此外，目前工程技术人员中有人问：“我们是不是高级知识分子？”在工矿中，出了事故，就追究工程技术人员的政治历史，有了成绩，是别人的。当前，工程技术界似乎比起文化教育界距离党更远。
    民革省委会主委龚自知说，目前党与非党民主人士有“三相”现象：相安无事，相敬如宾，相对无言。如何推倒隔墙，填平鸿沟，双方都有责任，共产党员要更主动。现在知识分子大多进步了，要从新估计知识分子的作用。我体会“长期共存、互相监督”，就是不见外。过去，或多或少有“先红后专”，“红重于专”的现象，这是阶级斗争遗留的影响。今后，我想党对知识分子是否可以“红专并重”，然后要求非党知识分子“红专并进”。
    民主促进会昆明筹备工作组召集人、师院附中校长秦淑贞说，在学校中，什么事都是“党、团、工会、行政”，民主党派“不起作用”。但一有问题，就是你们民主党派如何如何。在行政工作中，我有职无权。有时有的工作不通过行政，党就直接布置给青年团去干了。
    民盟省委会副主任委员、省文化局副局长杨明分析党内产生宗派主义的根源是：（1）从历史上看，现在还存有战争状态的心理，战时的制度，农民意识；（2）新党员太多，锻炼不够，且很多从农村、军队来，对知识分子工作不理解；（3）因是执政党，有的人滋长了政治上的优越感。有上述原因，因此表现在学校中就是单纯政治观点，人事干部不懂业务，以“革大”的办法掌握干部材料，对现在活的人的热情看不见。
