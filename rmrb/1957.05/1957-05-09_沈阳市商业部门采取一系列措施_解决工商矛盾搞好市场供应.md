Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 6th - How to resolve industrial and commercial contradictions, support each other, and jointly improve market commodity supply? The experience of Shenyang City Department Store in establishing mutually beneficial and cooperative relationships with local industry and handicrafts provides a good example.

In recent years, the relationship between the Shenyang City Department Store and local industry and handicrafts departments has been very abnormal. When organizing local industrial and handicraft processing work, the City Department Store, due to a one-sided economic accounting mentality, set processing fees too low. When processing products, it only considered seasonal needs, without making year-round arrangements. It demanded a lot during the peak season and little during the off-season, preventing processing departments from achieving balanced production throughout the year. In the allocation of raw materials and acceptance work, there were also complicated procedures and unreasonable systems. This seriously affected the enthusiasm of industrial departments to produce, and many production units were unwilling to process for the City Department Store. Many handicrafts flowed to other places. For example, in the second quarter of last year, the leather shoes flowing from Shenyang to other places accounted for 16% of the total output, and in the third quarter it increased to 22%. Commercial departments encountered many difficulties in organizing sources of goods, and stock-outs often occurred in the market during the peak season.

In the second half of last year, huge changes took place in the market's commodity sales, and the sales volume of many commodities increased. The leaders of the City Department Store and grassroots stores deeply realized that it was necessary to seriously solve industrial and commercial contradictions and work together to ensure market supply. After specific research, they believed that arranging some commodities for year-round production in advance to maintain balanced industrial production was the primary key to improving industrial and commercial relations. Therefore, starting from the fourth quarter of last year, the City Department Store adopted a series of measures to adjust industrial and commercial relations, such as arranging processing tasks in advance, adjusting processing fees, simplifying the system of allocating raw materials and accepting finished products, and helping industry solve raw material difficulties.

At the same time, the City Department Store, based on the principle of reasonable distribution of profits between industry and commerce, adjusted the processing fees for certain products. This made the profits obtained by industry and commerce more reasonable.

In the work of improving industrial and commercial relations, the seventeen stores under the City Department Store also frequently held "production and sales symposiums" to exchange opinions with processing departments. According to the opinions raised by the processing departments, the stores now allocate raw materials and accept finished products in one place at a time. The procedures have been reduced from the original twenty-six to five. Joint venture companies, Beishi and Second Store have also signed contact contracts with industrial departments, implementing a "finished product packaging signing system." The industrial departments are responsible for inspecting the products, packaging them, and sending them to the stores. The stores no longer inspect them, and the industrial departments are responsible for repair and replacement if there are any problems.

    沈阳市商业部门采取一系列措施
    解决工商矛盾搞好市场供应
    据新华社沈阳6日电　怎样解决工商矛盾、互相支援、共同搞好市场商品供应？沈阳市百货公司和地方工业、手工业建立互助合作关系的经过提供了一个良好的范例。
    几年来，沈阳市百货公司和地方工业、手工业部门的关系一直很不正常。市百货公司在组织地方工业、手工业加工工作中，由于片面的经济核算思想，加工费订得过低；加工产品时又只顾当季需要，不做常年安排，旺季要的多，淡季要的少，使加工部门不能常年均衡生产。在拨付原料和验收工作中，也存在手续繁多和制度不合理的现象。这样就严重地影响了工业部门生产积极性，许多生产单位都不愿为市百货公司加工，许多手工业品流往外地。如去年第二季度从沈阳流往外地的皮鞋占总产量的16％，三季度便增加到22％。商业部门组织货源遇到不少困难，旺季市场也往往发生脱销的现象。
    去年下半年，市场上的商品销售情况发生了巨大变化，许多商品销售量增加。市百货公司和基层商店的领导深刻认识到必须认真解决工商矛盾，共同努力保证市场物资供应。他们经过具体研究后认为，提前安排一些常年生产的商品以保持工业均衡生产，是搞好工商关系的首要关键。于是从去年第四季度开始，市百货公司便采取了提前安排加工任务、调整加工费、简化拨付原料和成品验收制度、帮助工业解决原材料困难等一系列调整工商关系的措施。
    同时，市百货公司从工商合理分配利润的原则出发，调整了某些产品的加工费。这样就使工商所得利润趋于合理。
    在改进工商关系的工作中，市百货公司所属的十七个商店还经常通过召开“产销座谈会”的形式，同加工部门互相交换意见。根据加工部门提的意见，现在各商店已做到一次一地拨付原料，一次一地验收成品。手续已由原来的二十六道改为五道。联营公司、北市和第二商店等还和工业部门签订联系合同，实行“成品包装签收制”，产品由工业部门负责验收后，包装好送往商店，商店不再验收，如有毛病工业部门保修保换。
