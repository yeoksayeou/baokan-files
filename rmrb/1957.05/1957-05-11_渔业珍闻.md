　　Fishery Anecdotes

　　A Large Yellow Croaker Weighing One Hundred and Twenty-Five Jin
　　The Huangmen Fishery Cooperative in Yuhuan County, Zhejiang, caught a large yellow croaker in the Pishan Fishing Grounds on the afternoon of the 29th of last month. It was five *chi* (Chinese feet, a unit of measure roughly equivalent to a foot) long and weighed one hundred and twenty-five *jin* (Chinese pounds, a unit of measure roughly equivalent to a pound). The scales on the fish were as big as silver dollars. According to veteran fishermen, they have never heard of such a large yellow croaker. (Wang Gang)

　　Large Lobster and Large Hawksbill Turtle
　　The Huaping Fishery Production Cooperative in Yuhuan County, Zhejiang, recently caught a large lobster measuring one *chi* and two *cun* (Chinese inches, where 10 *cun* = 1 *chi*) long and weighing three *jin* in Pishan Yang; and salvaged a large hawksbill turtle weighing more than one hundred and fifty *jin* with thirty-six purplish-red scales on its body.

　　Catching a Seal in the Bohai Bay
　　A seal, three *chi* long, weighing more than fifty *jin*, covered in grey fur with black spots, was recently caught in the Bohai Bay by members of the Xinghua Fishery Cooperative in Jiajiabao, Huanghua County, Hebei. The seal was very fat. After being caught, it was kept in a wooden trough. Whenever people touched it, it would bare its teeth and roar. The seal is an amphibious animal. When placed on the beach, it would leisurely roll around in the sun, which was very cute. The seal's appetite was not large, and just over two *jin* of fish a day was enough.

    渔业珍闻
  一百二十五斤重的大黄鱼
    浙江玉环县的黄门渔业社，于上月29日下午在披山渔场捕到了一条身长五市尺、体重一百二十五斤的大黄鱼。鱼身上的鳞，像银洋一样大。据老渔民反映，从来也没有听说过有这样大的黄鱼。（王刚）
    大龙虾和大玳瑁
    浙江玉环县花坪渔业生产合作社，最近在披山洋捕到一只身长一尺二寸、重三斤的大龙虾；在海上捞获一只重一百五十多斤、身上有三十六片紫红色鳞甲的大玳瑁。
    渤海湾里擒海豹
    一只身长三尺，体重五十多斤的，满身灰毛，夹有黑色斑点的海豹，不久以前被河北黄骅县贾家堡兴华渔业社的社员们在渤海湾里捕到了。这只海豹很肥胖，捉住以后，养在一个木槽里，人们一触动它，它就张牙舞爪地咆哮起来。海豹是水陆两栖的动物，把它放在海滩上，它就悠然自得地在太阳底下打滚，很是可爱。这只海豹的食量并不大，每天有二斤多鱼就够吃了。
