    Atomic Threats Cannot Prevent the Liberation of Taiwan
    By our commentator
    The United States and the Chiang Kai-shek clique have decided to station a U.S. atomic weapons unit equipped with missiles in Taiwan. This decision once again exposes the United States' long-term ambition to occupy China's territory Taiwan and turn it into an atomic base for American aggression.

    The United States' attempt to occupy Taiwan for a long time and use the Taiwan issue to create tension in Asia has long been known to everyone. The United States has repeatedly obstructed and delayed the Sino-U.S. ambassadorial talks in Geneva, refusing to reach an agreement on easing the tension in the Taiwan region, which shows that it has no intention of abandoning its policy of interfering in China's internal affairs and refuses to withdraw its armed forces in the Taiwan region. Nevertheless, in order to peacefully resolve international disputes, the Chinese side is still patiently continuing negotiations with the United States.

    On the other hand, the Chinese people have made great efforts to peacefully liberate Taiwan. This effort by the Chinese people has had a profound impact within the Chiang Kai-shek clique, and the possibility of peacefully liberating Taiwan is constantly increasing. This situation has made the American aggressive clique very uneasy, so it has intensified its control over the Chiang Kai-shek clique in all aspects, and actively supported and supported the resolute pro-American elements in this clique to prevent the realization of peaceful liberation of Taiwan. And this practice of the United States can only make the anti-American sentiment of the people in Taiwan even higher, and at the same time promote the contradictions within the Chiang Kai-shek clique to become more acute. Therefore, the United States stationed atomic weapons troops in Taiwan, of course, to use the so-called "policy of strength" to prevent the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan, and in a more realistic sense, it is to use the display of so-called "strength" to suppress the anti-American sentiment of the people in Taiwan, to support those in the Chiang Kai-shek clique who oppose negotiating with the Chinese people and advocate following the United States on a dead end, and to obstruct the peaceful liberation of Taiwan. At the same time, the United States' transformation of Taiwan into its atomic weapons base is not only a threat to China, but also a threat to peace in Asia and the world. Therefore, it will undoubtedly be opposed and condemned by peace-loving people in Asia and around the world.

    The United States' stationing of atomic weapons troops in Taiwan cannot shake the determination of the entire Chinese people to liberate Taiwan in the slightest. In today's world, when people all over the world are increasingly strongly opposed to the use of atomic weapons and nuclear weapons, and when the United States has lost its monopoly on atomic weapons and nuclear weapons, anyone who dares to use atomic weapons is announcing the arrival of his own demise. For the Chinese people, the United States' transformation of Taiwan into its atomic base only highlights the increasing pain and disaster of our compatriots in Taiwan, which will make us more determined to work hard to liberate Taiwan and save our compatriots from American enslavement.

    原子威胁不能阻止台湾的解放
    本报评论员
    美国和蒋介石集团已经决定让一支拥有导弹的美国原子武器部队驻扎在台湾。这个决定又一次暴露了美国长期侵占中国领土台湾、把台湾变成美国进行侵略的原子基地的野心。
    美国企图长期侵占台湾，利用台湾问题在亚洲制造紧张局势，这早就是大家都知道的事情。美国在日内瓦中美两国大使级会谈中百般阻挠拖延，不肯就和缓台湾地区紧张局势的问题达成协议，就说明它无意放弃它的干涉中国内政的政策，不肯撤退它在台湾地区的武装力量。虽然如此，为了和平解决国际争端，中国方面仍然在耐心地继续同美国进行谈判。
    另一方面，中国人民为和平解放台湾作了很大的努力。中国人民的这种努力，在蒋介石集团内部引起了深刻的影响，使和平解放台湾的可能性不断增长。这种情况使美国侵略集团非常不安，因而加紧了对蒋介石集团的各方面的控制，并且积极扶植和支持这个集团中的坚决亲美的分子，来防止和平解放台湾的实现。而美国的这种做法，只能使台湾人民的反美情绪更加高涨，同时也促进了蒋介石集团内部的矛盾更加尖锐。因此，美国在台湾驻扎原子武器部队，固然是为了用所谓“实力政策”来阻挠中国人民解放台湾，而在更现实的意义上，却是要用显示所谓“实力”来镇压台湾人民的反美情绪，给蒋介石集团中那些反对同中国人民谈判、主张跟着美国走上死路一条的人撑腰，阻挠台湾的和平解放。同时，美国把台湾变成它的原子武器基地，这不仅是对中国的威胁，而且，也是对亚洲和世界和平的威胁。因而无疑将受到亚洲和世界各国爱好和平的人民的反对和谴责。
    美国在台湾驻扎原子武器部队，并不能丝毫动摇全体中国人民解放台湾的决心。在全世界人民日益强烈反对使用原子武器和核武器的今天，在美国已经丧失原子武器和核武器的垄断权的今天，谁要是胆敢使用原子武器，他就是在宣告自己灭亡的到来。对于中国人民来说，美国把台湾变成它的原子基地，只是着重说明了台湾同胞们的痛苦和灾难在日益加深，而这将使我们更加坚决地为解放台湾、从美国奴役下拯救我们的同胞而努力。
