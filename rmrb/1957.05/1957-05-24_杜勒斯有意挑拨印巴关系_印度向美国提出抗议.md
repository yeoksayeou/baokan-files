Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 23rd: Indian Deputy Minister of External Affairs, Mrs. Lakshmi Menon, said during question time in the People's House on the 22nd that the Indian government has lodged a protest with the United States government regarding US Secretary of State Dulles' statement that Kashmir was annexed by India.

Mrs. Lakshmi Menon formally stated that Dulles' statement was "inconsistent with the facts" and caused the Indian government "distress and anguish".

Dulles made this statement to the press in New York in April this year, when UN Security Council Representative Jarring was conducting negotiations in India and Pakistan. Indian public opinion believes that Dulles's motive for making such a statement was to intensify tensions between India and Pakistan and make the Kashmir issue more difficult to resolve.

Prior to this, the United States Information Service had hung a new map in its library in Delhi with the inscription: "India continues to occupy Kashmir." The "Blitz" weekly reported the news about this map, and four days later the US Information Service removed the map. At the time, a spokesman for the US Embassy in Delhi evasively said that the map "does not represent the policy of the US government." However, Dulles subsequently issued the aforementioned statement regarding Kashmir, which demonstrated the US attitude.

### 杜勒斯有意挑拨印巴关系  印度向美国提出抗议

    杜勒斯有意挑拨印巴关系
    印度向美国提出抗议
    新华社新德里23日电　印度外交部副部长拉克希米·梅农夫人22日在人民院的质询时间内说，印度政府已经就美国国务卿杜勒斯所说的克什米尔是被印度兼并的谈话向美国政府提出了抗议。
    拉克希米·梅农夫人正式声明，杜勒斯的这种谈话是“不符合事实”的，并且使印度政府感到“痛心和苦恼”。
    杜勒斯今年4月在纽约向报界发表了这种谈话，那时正是联合国安全理事会代表雅林在印度和巴基斯坦进行谈判的时候。印度舆论认为，杜勒斯发表这种谈话的动机是加剧印度和巴基斯坦之间的紧张关系，并且使克什米尔问题更难解决。
    在这以前，美国新闻处在德里的图书馆里曾经挂过一幅新地图，上面写着：“印度继续占领着克什米尔”。“闪电”周报报道了关于这幅地图的消息，四天以后，美国新闻处撤除了这幅地图。当时，美国驻德里大使馆的发言人遮掩说，这幅地图“并不代表美国政府的政策”。但是，杜勒斯随后就发表了表明美国态度的前述关于克什米尔的谈话。
