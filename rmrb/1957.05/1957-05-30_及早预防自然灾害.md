    Preventing Natural Disasters Early

    To achieve a great agricultural harvest in 1957, all regions must make early preparations for preventing natural disasters. Given the current heavy tasks of rectification and other work, Party and government leading organs at all levels should make proper arrangements to ensure that the work of preventing natural disasters is well done.
    According to forecasts from the Central Meteorological Research Institute, the climate will be relatively complex during this summer and autumn, and disasters such as floods, droughts, and typhoons may still occur in some areas. Moreover, the time when floods rise has been earlier in recent years than in the past, and there is still a possibility that it will be earlier this year. In fact, since late April, some areas in the Huai River basin have already experienced waterlogging, flash floods, and hailstorms. Guangdong Province has also experienced three heavy rains in a row, causing flash floods in Haifeng, Lufeng, Zengcheng and other counties. Jiangxi, Fujian, Hubei and other provinces have also had flash floods. In Zhejiang Province, Huangyan, Wenling, Quzhou and other fourteen counties have experienced several consecutive rainstorms and hailstorms. At the same time, drought has occurred in some areas of Liaoning, Guizhou and other provinces. This should arouse our high vigilance. We must make careful plans and complete all preparations before the arrival of disasters. However, some cadres and masses currently have a fluke mentality. They think, "Last year was a year of heavy disasters, so there won't be any particularly large disasters this year, right?" This idea is very harmful.
    Under normal circumstances, natural disasters can be prevented and rescued. Especially after agricultural cooperativization, agricultural cooperatives have concentrated manpower and materials, providing excellent conditions for preventing and rescuing natural disasters. Last year, China suffered even greater floods than in 1954, but many agricultural cooperatives in disaster areas not only preserved their harvests but also increased production. For example, the Nanwangzhuang Village Agricultural Cooperative in Anping County, Hebei Province, experienced unprecedented floods last year, but its corn production increased by 267% compared to 1955. The Jinxing Agricultural Forestry and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative in Xigou Village, Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, suffered continuous disasters such as hailstorms, rainstorms, and flash floods, but its total production value increased by 16.8% compared to 1955. The Patriotic Agricultural Cooperative in Ju County, Shandong Province, despite continuous rain, waterlogging, typhoons, and insect pests, still exceeded its original plan by 4.48 jin per mu. The San Shan Agricultural Cooperative in Zhenhai, Zhejiang Province, was attacked by a powerful typhoon of magnitude twelve and sea tides, but the total income of the cooperative increased by 29.8% compared to 1955. There are many such examples in various places. However, there are also some agricultural cooperatives whose disasters could have been prevented and rescued, but suffered severe production cuts. Why is it that under the same conditions, some increased production while others suffered severe production cuts? The key issue is that the former cooperatives' manpower and material preparations, as well as post-disaster rescue and remedial work, were well organized, enabling them to fight disasters in a timely and orderly manner. The latter cooperatives, on the other hand, lacked careful organization and ideological preparation beforehand, and when disaster struck, they were caught off guard, naturally suffering serious losses.
    Pre-disaster preparation and organizational work include many aspects. In areas prone to floods, the solidity of dikes and embankments should be generally inspected before the rainy season, and any unsound parts should be repaired immediately. The preparation of flood control and drainage equipment should be checked to avoid temporary shortages. In areas prone to drought, small-scale water conservancy projects built in the past, especially last winter and this spring, should be inspected and repaired; various waterwheels, treadmills, pumps, and other water-drawing tools should be added and repaired to ensure that they can truly play their role in fighting drought. In areas prone to typhoons, attention should be paid to listening to weather forecasts, strengthening protection against tides and floods, protecting crops, protecting houses, livestock, and large farm implements, and mobilizing cooperative members living in dangerous houses to move in time. Various disasters often occur simultaneously or consecutively in one area, so when preventing drought, do not neglect flood prevention; and when preventing floods, do not neglect drought prevention. After making preventive preparations, prepare for rescue. It is necessary to rescue people, livestock, and property, as well as various crops. Agricultural cooperatives should rationally arrange labor in advance according to the needs of rescue, prepare rescue tools, equip cadres and Party and Youth League backbone members, divide responsibilities, and assign areas of responsibility to ensure rapid rescue when necessary. Prevention and rescue work should be carried out with redoubled efforts, fighting repeatedly against disasters with the tenacious spirit of "three immersions and four plantings" and "five waterloggings and five drainages."
    In prevention and rescue, attention should be paid to strengthening the socialist and collectivist education of cooperative members. Before cooperativization, farmers fought over water sources and blocked drainage for prevention and rescue. "They often quarrelled, and the crops suffered." This phenomenon no longer exists after cooperativization. Now, everyone is trying to save the cooperative's crops, and "enemies have become relatives." This is the main aspect. However, there are also some new problems. Some cooperative members only care about their own property in disaster prevention and rescue, neglecting public property; or they think that "the cooperative is large and there are many people, and no matter how much the loss or gain is, it won't amount to much on themselves," so they do not actively participate in prevention and rescue. Sometimes contradictions also arise between cooperatives in drainage and irrigation. There is even a phenomenon of "using neighbors as moats" in some areas. Therefore, agricultural cooperatives must instill the idea of "protecting the cooperative as protecting the home" and promote the spirit of unity and mutual assistance in prevention and rescue. Cooperatives and teams should establish the idea of ​​mutual consideration and mutual support. It is wrong to think that after cooperativization, the conflicts of interest between individual farmers have been resolved, and there are no conflicts between cooperatives and teams, so ideological leadership can be relaxed.
    Another important aspect of disaster prevention and famine preparation is thrift and savings. Gaining a certain amount of savings from practicing thrift not only reduces the difficulty of surviving famine after a disaster but also enhances the material strength of disaster prevention. In recent years, the atmosphere of thrift in many disaster-stricken rural areas has become relatively thin. Some people in disaster areas have also developed a psychology of simply relying on agricultural cooperatives and the state. They say: "Work when the bell rings, and look for the cooperative director when there is nothing to eat." They do not plan to be frugal and live within their means. Once a disaster occurs, they rely on state relief. Therefore, cadres must lead by example and motivate the masses to save in various ways. In the past, the vast rural areas of our country had the habit of storing grain to prepare for famine. During the Anti-Japanese War, Yan'an also advocated "cultivating three and saving one," calling on everyone to store grain. Article 7 of the National Agricultural Development Program states: "All agricultural production cooperatives are required, in addition to the grain they consume themselves and the grain that guarantees the needs of the state, to save surplus grain sufficient for one year, one and a half years, or two years of consumption within twelve years, starting from 1956, according to local conditions, for use in times of emergency." This year, places with bumper harvests of summer and autumn crops should begin to seriously study this issue, or conduct typical pilot projects, calling on agricultural cooperatives with the conditions to start storing grain in addition to guaranteeing the needs of the state and their own consumption.
    Governments at all levels should also be fully prepared for relief work in the event of a disaster. At the beginning of a disaster, emergency relief should be handled in the spirit of solving the practical difficulties of disaster victims and saving money for the country. Last year, some places did not understand the actual situation and blindly allocated funds downward, investing too much and causing serious waste. Zhang Ai, a disaster victim in Jingyuan Township, Changtai County, Fujian Province, reported that he lost one qian of gold, 180 yuan in RMB, and 30 silver dollars in the flood, and the government compensated him in full. Zheng Laoqiu, a disaster victim in Xidong Township, reported that he only lost 897 yuan in the flood, but the government provided 1,000 yuan in relief. These caused very bad influences. When the masses saw the government taking care of and compensating for disasters in this way, they did not want to engage in production for self-help. In the future, if disasters occur, attention must be paid to preventing this tendency in providing relief.
    Party and government leading organs at all levels and the vast number of rural cadres should pay sufficient attention to the work of preventing natural disasters and help agricultural cooperatives plan and prepare early. It is necessary to recognize that this is very directly related to striving for a great agricultural harvest this year and consolidating agricultural cooperatives. All rural work comrades should stand with the masses in the struggle to prevent disasters and work together to overcome all disasters.

### 及早预防自然灾害

    及早预防自然灾害
    为实现1957年的农业大丰收，各地必须及早做好预防自然灾害的工作。在目前整风等任务比较繁重的情形下，各地党政领导机关应该妥善安排，务必做好预防自然灾害的工作。
    今年夏秋期间，据中央气象研究所预测，气候的变化是比较复杂的，水、旱、台风等灾害在部分地区仍有发生的可能。而且，这几年洪水涨发的时间都比过去提早，今年仍有提早的可能。事实上，从4月下旬以来，淮河流域部分地区已经发生了内涝、山洪和冰雹等灾害，广东省也连降了三次大雨，以致海丰、陆丰、增城等县山洪暴发。江西、福建、湖北等省也有山洪。浙江省的黄岩、温岭、衢县等十四个县连续发生几次暴风雨和冰雹灾害。同时，辽宁、贵州等省的部分地区则发生了干旱现象。这就应该引起我们的高度警惕，我们要周密计划，把各项准备工作完成在灾害到来之前。可是，目前在部分干部和群众中却存在着一种侥幸的想法。他们以为“去年是个重灾年，今年不会再有特大灾害了吧？”这种想法是非常有害的。
    在一般情况下，自然灾害是可以预防，也可以抢救的。特别是农业合作化以后，农业社集中了人力和物资，给预防和抢救自然灾害提供了很好的条件。去年我国遭受了比1954年更大的水灾，可是受灾地区有很多的农业社不但保住了收成，而且还增产了。比如河北省安平县南王庄村农业社，去年遭遇了史无前例的洪水，玉米的产量却比1955年增产达267％。山西省平顺县西沟村金星农林牧生产合作社，连续遭受冰雹、暴雨、山洪等灾害，生产总值反比1955年增加了16.8％。山东省莒县爱国农业社，虽然连续遭受雨涝、台风和虫灾，每亩产量还是超过了原订计划4.48斤。浙江省镇海三山农业社，在十二级强大台风和海潮的袭击下，全社总收入却比1955年增加了29.8％。这种事例在各地都很多。但是，也有一部分农业社所受的灾害本来可以预防，也可以抢救，却遭到了严重的减产。为什么在同样的条件下，有的增产，有的严重减产呢？问题的关键在于：前一种社的人力、物力准备和灾后抢救、补救的工作，都组织得很好，能够适时地有秩序地同灾害进行战斗。而后一种社，事先缺乏周密的组织和思想准备，一旦遇灾，仓惶应战，自然就难免遭受严重损失了。
    灾前的准备工作和组织工作，包括许多方面。容易闹水灾的地区，要在雨季到来之前，普遍检查堤防圩垸的坚实程度，不坚实的立即修补；检查防汛、排涝器材的准备，以免临时供应不上。容易闹旱灾的地区，要把过去特别是去冬今春兴修的小型水利工程加以检查和修整；增添和修补各种水车、筒车、抽水机及其他汲水工具，使它们真正能够发挥抗旱效能。容易遭受台风的地区，要注意收听气象预报，加强防潮、防汛，保护农作物，保护房屋、牲畜、大农具，动员居住在危险房屋内的社员及时迁移。各种灾害往往在一个地区同时或者接连发生，因此在防旱的时候，不要忽视防水；在防水的时候，也不要忽视防旱。作了预防的准备，还要作抢救的准备。既要抢救人、牲畜和财物，又要抢救各种农作物。农业社应当根据抢救的需要，事先合理安排劳动力，准备抢救工具，配备干部和党团骨干，分工负责，划片包干，以便必要时迅速抢救。预防和抢救工作要再接再厉，以“三淹四种”“五涝五排”的顽强精神，反复地和灾害进行斗争。
    在预防和抢救中，要注意加强对社员的社会主义和集体主义教育。在合作化以前，农民为了预防和抢救，争用水源、阻止排涝。“经常吵架，苦了庄稼”。合作化以后这种现象不存在了。现在大家为了抢救社里的庄稼，“冤家也变成了亲家”。这是主要的方面。但是，新的问题也有一些。有的社员在防灾和抢救中，只顾自己的财产，不顾公共的财产；或者认为“社大人多，无论损失或收益，摊到自己身上都没有多少”，所以不积极参加预防和抢救。社与社之间，在排水、灌溉上有时也发生矛盾。个别地区还有“以邻为壑”的现象。因此，农业社在预防和抢救中必须使所有的社员树立起“保社如保家”的思想，发扬团结互助的精神。社与社、队与队之间应该树立彼此兼顾、互相支援的思想。认为合作化以后个体农户之间的利害矛盾解决了，社与社、队与队之间没有矛盾了，因而可以放松思想领导的想法是错误的。
    防灾备荒的另一个重要方面是节约和储蓄。从厉行节约中得到一定的储蓄，不但在灾后可以减少渡荒的困难，而且也可以增强预防灾害的物质力量。近年来，许多灾区农村的节约空气比较稀薄了。有些灾区的群众也增长了单纯依赖农业社、依赖国家的心理。他们说：“做事听钟响，没吃找社长。”不作省吃俭用、细水长流的打算。一旦遭灾，就依赖国家救济。因此干部必须以身作则，带动群众，从多方面节约。我国广大农村过去就有储粮备荒的习惯。在抗日时期的延安，也曾提倡过“耕三余一”，号召大家储粮。全国农业发展纲要第七条说：“要求一切农业生产合作社，除了自己食用的和保证国家需要的粮食以外，从1956年开始，在十二年内，按照各地情况，分别储蓄足够一年、一年半或者两年食用的余粮，以备紧急时候的需要。”今年夏、秋作物丰收的地方，应当开始认真研究这一问题，或作典型试办，号召有条件的农业社，在保证满足国家需要和自己食用的粮食以外，开始储备粮食。
    对于遇灾时的救济工作，各级政府也应当有充分的准备。在发生灾情之初，应当本着既能解决灾民实际困难，又能为国家节约用款的精神，办理急救。去年有些地方没有了解实际情况，就盲目向下拨款，投放过多，造成严重浪费。福建省长泰县京元乡灾民张矮自报在水灾中丢了金子一钱，人民币一百八十元，银元三十块，政府都如数赔偿了。溪东乡灾民郑老秋自报在水灾中只损失八百九十七元，政府却救济了一千元。这些造成了很不好的影响。群众看到政府这样包灾、赔灾，就不想生产自救了。今后如果遇有灾害，在进行救济中，必须注意防止这种偏向。
    各级党政领导机关和广大农村干部，对于预防自然灾害的工作应当有足够的重视，帮助农业社及早筹划和准备。要认识这对争取今年农业大丰收和巩固农业社有非常直接的关系。所有的农村工作同志，都应当在预防灾害的斗争中，和群众站在一起，共同努力战胜一切灾害。
