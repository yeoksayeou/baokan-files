    "May Day" in Budapest
    By Our Correspondent Hu Jibang
    Before "May Day," Budapest already felt like early summer. People were preparing to wear summer clothes for the holiday. On the morning of "May Day," however, it suddenly drizzled, and the temperature dropped. But the worsening weather did not affect people's enthusiasm to participate in the rally. Two hours before the meeting, the crowds, with their families, began to converge on the assembly square. The area near Heroes' Square quickly became a vast sea of people.
    This year, participation in "May Day" was based on the principle of voluntarism; whoever wanted to come could come, and whoever didn't want to come didn't have to. Moreover, there was only a meeting and no parade. Today's great scene of two or three hundred thousand people gathered together could not help but surprise every participant. Who could calculate the exact number today? This question caused an interesting debate among the leading comrades on the reviewing stand. Some said that at least 250,000 to 300,000 people came today, and others said, no, at least 350,000 to 400,000 people. Finally, someone suggested a calculation method: count how many pairs of shoes there are and divide it by two to get the most accurate number.
    The counter-revolutionary rebellion of last October first happened on this square. How long ago was it that such a great scene of victory appeared on this square again, which cannot but convince people of the power of truth and the superiority of socialism.
    Today is the first review of the power of the Hungarian people who defeated the counter-revolution. Workers at the Csepel factory told me that this year's "May Day" is not as magnificent as last year. In the past, before the festival arrived, their factory had workshops specifically in charge of arranging "May Day" models and charts. This year's "May Day" was made by the participants using their own feelings to create "May" flower trees and simple banners. Most importantly, everyone came here with a fervent heart.
    This year, there are not many decorations in the team, and no photos or charts can be seen, but it is filled with a special atmosphere, a particularly sincere emotion, like a family reunited after a disaster. People feel that this home is warmer and more lovable, and they are full of confidence in it.
    The worker also mentioned that the counter-revolutionaries overturned the quota labor competitions in the factory last year. Now, Csepel's enterprises have generally restored these competitions and are currently undertaking a glorious task: to set an example and promote the efficiency of national workers.
    Farmers who came from Zala County specifically to participate in the meeting said that the people in their village trust the government and are active in production, which is reflected in the fact that they have invested a lot in the land this year. He believes that there will be a good harvest nationwide this year.
    A young and simple female president of the Fifth District Court, Szamosne, was squeezed out by reactionary elements during the October events and was deprived of her most beloved profession. She only returned to her original post three months ago. Speaking of this, she couldn't help but feel sad and shed tears. She said that now she understands even more how she should consolidate the cause of the proletarian dictatorship in her own trial work.
    Today, the most noticeable on the square is the team of more than 10,000 members of the Communist Youth League wearing light blue shirts. They have just received the red flag awarded by the Party, and they are still reviewing with excitement what Comrade Marosan said in Republic Square. Comrade Marosan, on behalf of the Party, told the young people: Now your happiness was bought with blood and struggle by your predecessors, and you should protect it well. During the October events, the enemy tried to take away your happiness. In Republic Square, many loyal young Communist Party members sacrificed themselves. The trees in the square are still weeping, and the mottled walls still bear the bloodstains of the martyrs. Don't forget that if the counter-revolutionaries had succeeded, the happiness of your worker and peasant children would have been lost long ago, and the doors of the school would no longer be open to you. You must hold this red flag high and keep it forever in your hearts. Comrade Marosan's words greatly motivated the fighting spirit of every young person.
    The Communist Youth League is a new political force, inheriting the tradition of 1919, and was only announced on March 21 this year, the anniversary of the Soviet Republic (before the incident, there was only a general youth alliance). It has only been more than a month since then, and it has grown to 40,000 members. The Party's ranks have also grown stronger, and there are now 300,000 members. The Communist Youth League will become the Party's assistant, and its members are mainly young workers. At present, some young students in Hungary are still ideologically confused. Therefore, the Communist Youth League has a very important responsibility for the ideological education of young intellectuals.
    Marosan's speech and Kadar's report at the meeting lasted an hour and a half. The report summarized the struggles of the past six months and finally called on all the people to work hard to increase production and overcome economic difficulties.
    It rained briefly during the meeting, but the masses stood the test, and they stood until the end of the report, which shows that the freely assembled masses are also a disciplined team. They came in orderly and left in orderly. The workers' pickets, this new force, received their first "May Day" review today.
    Some entertainment programs were arranged in the park in the afternoon. The spontaneous songs in the beer shops were even more lively. Restaurants and cafes were crowded everywhere. The Liberty Statue on Gellért Hill and the Fisherman's Bastion were brilliantly lit. Budapest—this pearl on the Danube River—radiated a more beautiful light than usual on this festive night.

### “五一”在布达佩斯

    “五一”在布达佩斯
    本报记者　胡济邦
    “五一”节前，布达佩斯已像初夏。人们都准备在节日着上夏季服装。“五一”节早晨，忽然细雨蒙蒙，气温下降。可是，天气的恶化并没有影响人们参加大会的积极性，在开会前两小时，带着全家老小的群众队伍，便开始向大会的广场集中，英雄广场附近很快就变成了一片浩大的人海。
    今年参加“五一”节是根据自愿原则，谁愿意来就来，不愿意来就不来；而且只开会不游行。今天聚集着二三十万人的这个伟大场面，不能不令每个参加者都感到惊喜。谁能计算出今天的确实数字？这个问题在检阅台的领导同志中间曾引起有趣的争论。有人说今天至少有二十五万人到三十万人，有人说，不，至少有三十五万到四十万人。最后有人提出一个计算的办法，数一数有多少只皮鞋再用二除它，就会得出最正确的数字。
    去年10月的反革命暴乱就是在这个广场上首先发生的。曾几何时，这个广场上又出现了如此伟大的胜利场面，这不能不令人信服真理的力量和社会主义的优越性。
    今天是战胜反革命的匈牙利人民力量的第一次检阅。切佩尔工厂的工人告诉我，今年“五一”表面比不上去年富丽堂皇。在过去，他们的工厂在节日未到前，很早就有专管布置“五一”的车间设计模型和图表。今年“五一”是由参加者用自己的感情做成“五月”的花树，制成了简朴的锦旗，最重要的是每人都带着一颗赤热的心来到这里。
    今年在队伍中没有多少装璜，看不到一张像片和图表，但是洋溢一种特殊的气氛，一种特别真挚的情感，好像在遭难后又得到团聚的一个家庭，人们都感到这个家是更加温暖可爱，对它充满了信心。
    这个工人又谈到去年反革命把工厂中的定额劳动竞赛都打倒了，现在切佩尔的企业已把这些普遍恢复起来，目前正担负着一项光荣的任务，要做出榜样，推动全国工人提高生产的效率。
    从佐洛村特意赶来参加大会的农民说，他们村里人都信任政府，生产积极，这表现在今年对土地都投下了很多本。他相信今年全国会有一次好的收成。
    一位第五区法院的年轻朴素的女院长沙莫什妮，十月事件时，受了反动分子的排挤，被夺去了她最热爱的职业。三个月前，她才回到原来的工作岗位。谈到这里，她禁不住心酸流泪。她说，现在她更懂得在自己的审判工作中应如何来巩固无产阶级专政的事业。
    今天广场上最惹人注意的是那些穿着一色浅蓝衬衫的一万多名共产主义青年团的队伍，他们刚接受了党所授予的红旗，他们还带着激动的情绪在温习马罗山同志在共和国广场所讲过的话。马罗山同志代表党告诉青年们说：现在你们的幸福是先辈用鲜血和斗争换来的，你们应该很好地保卫它。在十月事件中，敌人企图夺走你们的幸福，在共和国广场上，有不少忠诚的青年共产党员牺牲了。广场上的树木还在流泪，斑剥的墙垣还留着烈士们的血迹。你们别忘记，如果反革命得逞的话，你们工农子弟的幸福早已就丧失了，学校的大门不会再为你们打开。你们要把这面红旗高高举起，让它永远保存在你们的心灵中。马罗山同志的这番话大大地鼓动了每个青年的战斗情绪。
    共产主义青年团是一支新的政治力量，它继承1919年的传统，在今年3月21日苏维埃共和国纪念日才宣布成立（事件以前只有一般的青年联盟）。到现在只有一个多月，已发展到四万团员。党的队伍也壮大了，现在已有三十万党员。共产主义青年团将成为党的助手，他们之中主要是劳动青年。现在，在匈牙利还有一部分青年学生思想混乱，因此，共产主义青年团对知识青年思想教育的责任十分重大。
    会上马罗山的讲话和卡达尔的报告达一个半小时。报告对半年来的斗争作了一次总结，最后号召全体人民为提高生产、克服经济困难而努力。
    开会中间下了一阵小雨，群众还是经得起考验，他们一直站着听到报告的结束，这说明自由集合的群众同时又是有纪律的队伍。他们有秩序地进来，又有秩序地退出。工人纠察队，这支新生的力量，今天受到了第一个“五一”节的检阅。
    下午公园中布置了一些娱乐节目。啤酒店中的自发的歌声更为热闹。餐厅和咖啡馆到处满座。格列尔山的自由神像下和鱼人堡的周围灯光辉煌。布达佩斯——这颗多瑙河上的明珠，在节日之夜，放射出了比往日更加美丽的光芒。
