Xinhua News Agency dispatch: According to Xinhua News Agency, Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko and Soviet Defense Minister Zhukov arrived in Budapest on the 27th. They came here to discuss and sign an agreement with the Hungarian government on the legal status of Soviet troops temporarily stationed in Hungary.

    On the same day, representatives of the Soviet and Hungarian governments signed an agreement in Budapest regarding the legal status of Soviet troops temporarily stationed in Hungary.

    The agreement pointed out that, in view of the existence of the aggressive North Atlantic bloc, the revival of West German militarism, and the threat posed to the security of socialist countries by the large number of troops and numerous military bases stationed by the United States and other members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization near these countries, it is appropriate and in accordance with international agreements for Soviet troops to be temporarily stationed in Hungary for the joint defense against possible aggression.

    The agreement stipulates that the temporary stationing of Soviet troops in Hungary shall in no way infringe upon Hungary's national sovereignty, nor shall it lead to interference by Soviet troops in Hungary's internal affairs.

    The number and location of Soviet troops temporarily stationed in Hungary will be determined in accordance with a special agreement between the Soviet and Hungarian governments. Within Hungary, any movement of Soviet troops outside their designated locations must be approved by the Hungarian government authorities each time.

    The agreement stipulates that Soviet troops stationed in Hungary, personnel within the Soviet military establishment, and their family members must respect and abide by Hungarian laws and regulations.

    The provisions in the agreement regarding jurisdiction stipulate that, as a general rule, Hungarian law applies to cases of crimes or offenses committed in Hungary by personnel within the Soviet military establishment or their family members. These cases will be handled by Hungarian courts, procuratorates, and other competent Hungarian authorities with the power to prosecute crimes and offenses. Criminal cases involving Soviet military personnel will be investigated by the Hungarian military procuratorate and handled by the Hungarian military judicial authorities.

    苏匈两国签订协定
    苏军暂驻匈牙利防御侵略
    本报综合报道　据新华社消息：苏联外交部长葛罗米柯和苏联国防部长朱可夫27日到达布达佩斯。他们来到这里是为了同匈牙利政府商谈签订有关暂时驻扎匈牙利境内的苏联军队的法律地位的协定。
    当日，苏联和匈牙利两国政府代表在布达佩斯签订了一项关于暂时驻扎在匈牙利的苏联军队的法律地位的协定。
    协定指出，鉴于侵略性的北大西洋集团的存在、西德军国主义的复活以及美国和北大西洋公约其他成员国在社会主义国家附近驻扎大批军队和保持许多军事基地威胁着这些国家的安全，在这种情况下，苏军暂时驻扎在匈牙利境内对于共同防御可能发生的侵略是适宜的，并且是符合国际协定的。
    协定规定，苏联军队在匈牙利的暂时驻扎决不能触犯匈牙利国家的主权，决不能导致苏联军队干涉匈牙利的内政。
    暂时留驻匈牙利境内的苏联军队的人数及驻扎地点，将根据苏匈两国间的特别协定确定。在匈牙利境内，苏联军队在驻扎地点以外的调动，每次都要取得匈牙利政府当局的同意。
    协定规定，驻扎匈牙利境内的苏联军队、苏联军队编制以内的人员和这些人员的家属，必须尊重和遵守匈牙利的法令。
    协定中有关裁判权问题的条款规定，作为一般规则，匈牙利法律适用于处理苏军编制以内的人员或他们的家属在匈牙利境内的犯罪或过失案件，这些案件由匈牙利法院、检察院和有权起诉罪行和过失的其他匈牙利主管机关处理。苏军军人犯罪案件由匈牙利军事检察院调查，并由匈牙利军法机关受理。
