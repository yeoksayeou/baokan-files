    Came Happily, Left Happily
    Over Ten Thousand Temporary Workers from Wuhan Iron and Steel Return to Their Hometowns for Production
    (Our newspaper, Wuhan, 11th dispatch) More than 10,000 temporary workers who came to work for the Water Supply and Drainage Company of Wuhan Iron and Steel this year have returned to their hometowns for production happily. Some said before leaving, "Whenever the construction site needs us in the future, we will come immediately. When we are not needed, we will return to our hometowns for production."
    The temporary workers of this company are all farmers from neighboring counties. These large numbers of temporary workers often enter and leave the site according to the needs of the project, with great mobility. The leaders of this company, based on this characteristic, pay great attention to doing political work well. Before each temporary worker enters the site, the company sends people to explain to them that after arriving at the construction site, they will be digging ditches, digging trenches, carrying soil, living in sheds, sleeping on common bunks, and that the food will cost more than in the countryside but may not be better, and that income will depend on more labor, etc., so that each temporary worker is mentally prepared. After entering the site, the company also organizes specialists to study and explain the contents of the contract with them, explaining the labor, living, and wage systems of the construction site, so that everyone understands that these systems and disciplines are to ensure the quality and progress of national construction, and thus consciously abide by them. During construction, company leaders go deep into the construction site, listen to the opinions of temporary workers, and help them arrange work and life. Not long ago, temporary workers from Xinzhou County reported that the agricultural cooperatives in the same area charged them different work point values, and both the cooperatives and the farmers had opinions. The company took the initiative to send people to study the matter with the Xinzhou County People's Committee, and a more reasonable and unified method was determined, which satisfied both parties.
    When the contract period expires and there are no new tasks, the company informs the temporary workers in advance to prepare to leave the site, explaining the reasons for leaving to everyone and soliciting their opinions. Then, the company is responsible for settling their accounts, helping them organize, and purchasing train and boat tickets for their return home. Award banners and rewards are also given to some good working collectives and individuals.
    When carrying out this work, the company pays great attention to close cooperation with local governments. Both parties send people to be responsible for this work. Before the temporary workers leave the site, the company informs the local government and asks them to prepare arrangements in advance so that each temporary worker has work immediately after returning to his hometown. At the same time, both parties also frequently study some problems among the temporary workers. At the beginning of this year, some temporary workers reported that there were too few recreational activities on the construction site, and some agricultural cooperatives did not take enough care of them. The company and relevant local governments invited some temporary workers to hold a forum to jointly study solutions, so that the work was improved and the opinions of the temporary workers were eliminated.

### 来也高兴　去也高兴  武钢一万多临时工回乡生产

    来也高兴　去也高兴
    武钢一万多临时工回乡生产
    本报武汉11日电　今年来武钢工地供排水公司工作的一万多临时工人，已经愉快地回乡生产了。有的人临走时说：“今后工地什么时候需要我们，我们马上就来，什么时候不需要了，我们就回乡生产。”
    这个公司的临时工人都是来自邻近各县的农民。这大量的临时工人往往根据工程需要，时而进场，时而退场，流动性很大。这个公司的领导人员根据这个特点，非常注意作好政治工作。每次临时工进场以前，公司就派专人向他们说明到工地后做的是挖沟、挖槽、挑土，住的是工棚，睡的是通铺，伙食比农村花钱多但还不见得好，收入要靠多劳动等等，使每个临时工有思想准备。进入现场后，公司又组织专人同他们研究和解释合同内容，说明工地的劳动、生活和工资制度，使大家了解这些制度和纪律都是为了保证国家建设的质量和进度，从而自觉遵守。在施工中，公司领导人深入工地，倾听临时工的意见，帮助他们安排工作和生活。不久前，新洲县来的临时工反映，同一个地方的农业社向他们收的工分高低不一样，社和农民都有意见。公司便主动派人和新洲县人民委员会研究，定出了比较合理的统一办法，使双方都满意。
    合同限期满了，没有新任务，公司就事先通知临时工准备退场，把退场的原因向大家讲清楚，并征求他们的意见。然后，公司又负责地给他们结清账目，帮助他们组织起来，购买回乡的车船票。对一些工作好的集体和个人，还发给奖旗和奖励。
    这个公司在进行这个工作时，很注意和当地政府密切配合。双方都派专人负责这个工作。临时工将退场前，公司就通知当地政府，请他们事先准备安排，使每个临时工回乡后马上就有工作。同时，双方还经常研究临时工中的一些问题。今年年初，有的临时工反映工地文娱生活太少，有的农业社对他们照顾不够。公司又和有关的当地政府邀请一些临时工开座谈会，共同研究办法，使工作有了改进，临时工的意见得到消除。（陈牧）
