Xinhua News Agency, May 27th. According to Agence France-Presse (AFP) Taipei, Chiang Kai-shek clique’s "Foreign" Minister Yeh Kung-chao said at a press conference that began at 4:00 PM today, that the Kuomintang authorities "deeply regret and consider inappropriate" the anti-American incident that occurred on May 24th. Yeh Kung-chao said that police arrested more than 30 demonstrators inside and outside the American "Embassy," arrested 16 demonstrators at or near the United States Information Service, and later arrested about 20 more people. Yeh Kung-chao also denied the obvious facts, trying his best to deny that this demonstration was an expression of the accumulated anti-American sentiment of the Taiwanese residents. Instead, he described it as merely a reaction to "a specific matter" (referring to the Reynolds case). He also said that he hoped this incident would not damage relations with the United States.

Yeh Kung-chao said that he personally believes that the U.S. military's trial of the Reynolds premeditated murder case "is unsatisfactory," but this "Foreign" Minister actually believes that the Reynolds murder case should be tried by a U.S. military court, and even said, "I have no right to criticize the verdict." He said that he had asked the U.S. "Embassy" to study whether it was possible to review or retry the case, but had not yet received any formal reply.

Yeh Kung-chao said that negotiations are currently underway with the United States regarding the status of U.S. armed forces stationed in Taiwan under the 1954 U.S.-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty." He said that until a new agreement is signed, these U.S. armed forces currently enjoy "diplomatic privileges" in Taiwan on a temporary basis.

However, Yeh Kung-chao also said that this negotiation does not affect the status of the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group personnel stationed in Taiwan, because according to the agreement signed between the U.S. and Chiang in 1951, the personnel of the U.S. Military Advisory Group enjoy "diplomatic privileges." Therefore, Yeh Kung-chao actually believes that the murderer Reynolds, who killed Chinese people, "should be tried by a U.S. military court."

    蒋介石集团“外交”部长叶公超厚颜无耻
    竟承认在台美军人员享有“外交特权”
    新华社27日讯　据法新社台北消息，蒋介石集团“外交”部长叶公超在今天下午四时开始的记者招待会上说，国民党当局对5月24日发生的反美事件“深表遗憾并深以为不当”。叶公超说，警察在美国“大使馆”内外逮捕了三十多名示威群众，在美国新闻处或附近逮捕了十六名示威群众，后来又逮捕了约二十人。叶公超还抹杀有目共睹的事实，极力否认这次示威是台湾居民积累起来的反美情绪的表露。而把它说成只是对“对一个具体的事情”（指雷诺案件）的反应。并且说，他希望这次事件不至于损害与美国的关系。
    叶公超说，他个人认为，美国军方对雷诺有意杀人案的审判“是不能令人满意的”，可是，这个“外交”部长竟认为雷诺杀人案应该由美国军事法庭审判，竟说“我没有权利对判决提出责难”。他说，他曾经要求美国“大使馆”研究一下是否有可能检查或重新审判这个案件，但是还没有接到任何正式的回答。
    叶公超说，目前正就根据1954年签订的美蒋“共同防御条约”而在台湾驻扎的美国武装部队的地位问题，同美国进行谈判。他说，在新的协定签订以前，这些美国武装部队目前在台湾享有的“外交特权”是临时的。
    但是，叶公超又说这一谈判并不影响美国驻台湾军事援助顾问团人员的地位，因为根据美蒋之间在1951年签订的协定，美军顾问团人员是享有“外交特权”的。因此，叶公超竟认为杀害中国人的凶手雷诺“是要由美国军事法庭审判的”。
