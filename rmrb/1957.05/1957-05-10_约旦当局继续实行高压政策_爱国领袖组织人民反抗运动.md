Xinhua News Agency, Amman, 9th dispatch: Jordanian authorities continue to arrest patriots and ban youth organizations.

The report said that those arrested included members of the National Socialist Party and the Arab Ba'ath Socialist Party. Dr. Khadim, director of Ramallah Radio Station, was also arrested. Youth clubs and sports clubs in Jerusalem, Jericho and other places were closed.

The report said that Jordanian military governor Tuqan issued an order threatening to severely punish those who refuse to cooperate with the new government. The Nablus Municipal Council was dissolved for refusing to issue a statement supporting the new government's policies. About 50 Jordanian civil servants were dismissed on the 8th because they refused to work for the new government.

According to a report in the Egyptian "People's Daily" on the 8th, Jordanian nationalist leaders who have gone underground are organizing a secret people's resistance movement, preparing to fight against reactionary and imperialist forces. According to the newspaper, despite the arrest of hundreds of people, the leadership organization of the Jordanian nationalists has not been affected.

According to the Indian Press Trust, there are unconfirmed reports in Damascus that someone recently attempted to assassinate Jordanian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Rifai at the Jordanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but failed. Someone also sent Rifai a package of explosives, which was seized by the police.

The United States is preparing to directly support Jordanian finances. Nelson, the representative of the US Fourth Point Program in Jordan, revealed in Amman that he expects $4 million of the US's $10 million emergency grant to Jordan to be paid directly to the Jordanian treasury.
