Shaanxi Democratic Figures Present Opinions to Provincial Party Committee at Symposium, Requesting Strengthened United Front Work and Closer Party-Masses Relations

(Our newspaper, Xi'an, 18th dispatch) On the 17th, the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party invited representatives from the provincial-level democratic parties and non-party democratic figures in Shaanxi to attend a symposium. A total of nine people spoke at the meeting, raising many opinions on the united front work, the relationship between party and non-party members, and the leadership issues of the Provincial Party Committee. Zhang Desheng, the First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, responded to the opinions that could be answered immediately, and also proposed that some issues that were not clear at the moment would be addressed during this rectification campaign. Zhang Desheng also encouraged everyone to boldly criticize the work of the Party and help the Party carry out the rectification.

Han Zhao'e, Chairman of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, said: I feel that the united front work in Shaanxi Province is tight at the top and loose at the bottom. The province attaches importance to it, but the counties are worse; the Provincial Party Committee attaches importance to it, but the administrative departments are worse. For example, the Provincial People's Committee only sees administrative relationships and does not see united front relationships.

There are also many problems in the relationship between Party and non-Party members. Some people say: Party members are "a crane standing among chickens!" They are "cold in their actions and hum in their speech." Individual party members even stir up trouble and cause misunderstandings. For example, a department head was old and requested a sedan car instead of a jeep because it was inconvenient. I said that there are many elderly people and the solution should be considered comprehensively. As a result, someone told the department head what I said, and he said, "Everyone agrees, except Han," which made me and the department head unhappy.

In addition, there is sectarianism in the Party organizations within the government agencies. Some Party member cadres are promoted every year, and some are even promoted two levels in one year, and some have even been promoted three or even five levels in a few years. It does not matter whether they are qualified. If "talent is not enough to manage affairs, and virtue is not enough to convince the public," then the higher they are promoted, the worse it will be. Some Party members in government agencies do not study their work, but their "desire to command" is very strong.

Sun Weiruo, Chairman of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, said: The united front work is tight at the top and loose at the bottom. Some people at the lower level do not even know the nature of the democratic parties. I hope to strengthen the education of the united front work in the future.

Hou Zonglian, Chairman of the Xi'an Branch of the Jiusan Society, said: I think there is a sectarian tendency in schools. For example, when our Xi'an Medical College sent teachers to study in the Soviet Union, I emphasized that teachers with progressive thinking, strong professional ability, and good health should be sent. However, the school did not do this, but only sent Party members. When I inquired about this matter, the vice president said that it was approved by the Xi'an Municipal Party Committee. However, Northwest University and Xi'an Institute of Architectural Engineering have sent members of the China Democratic League to study in the Soviet Union, which shows that our school has a sectarian tendency.

Li Zijian, Vice Chairman of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, expressed his views on the role of democratic parties in schools. He said: The China Democratic League has indeed done a lot of work in schools, especially in universities, in recent years, and has had a significant impact. For example, it has made remarkable achievements at Northwest Agricultural College. The reason is that the Party organization there attaches great importance to it and also requires the China Democratic League to achieve results. But some schools are not so.

Han Wangchen, Chairman of the Xi'an Municipal Branch of the China Democratic National Construction Association, said: In the work of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, there are also many problems in the relationship between the Party and non-Party members. The Party and non-Party members in the Shaanxi Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce have not established a relationship, and the words of non-Party members do not count. In joint state-private enterprises, there is also discrimination against private personnel. For example, a public representative of the Xi'an Dahua Printing Factory announced to the private personnel at a meeting that now that the rectification campaign is about to begin, each of you should first write an autobiography and hand it in. Li Zenghua, from a certain joint state-private shop in Chang'an County, wanted to talk about his study experience at a meeting after returning from a study class, but the public representative announced that now Manager Li will make a self-criticism to everyone about his past mistakes. This left Li himself and the employees at a loss.

Li Xiangsheng, Chairman of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, said: In terms of organizational development, democratic parties have encountered many difficulties. Some Party organizations still do not care enough about and trust the democratic parties. For example, some grassroots organizations of the China Association for Promoting Democracy can generally take the initiative to strive for the leadership of the Party, but they often do not receive specific help. Therefore, some members of some grassroots organizations are dissatisfied.

Cheng Bairen, Vice Chairman of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, directly criticized the First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, saying: Secretary Zhang Desheng encouraged me to offer my opinions, so I will offer a few opinions to Secretary Zhang. I think Secretary Zhang is kind, humble, and good at approaching people, and has made great achievements in leading the work of Shaanxi Province in recent years. However, this does not mean that there are no shortcomings. I feel that Secretary Zhang's first shortcoming is that his thinking is not sharp enough and his actions are a bit slow. Second, Secretary Zhang lacks bold, creative, and diverse spirits in his leadership methods, and has the shortcomings of being too general. Third, I hope that Secretary Zhang will be determined to jump out of the circle of affairs and concentrate on studying some major issues.

Yuan Ruoyu, Vice Chairman of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, talked about the reasons for the formation of a wall between the Party and the masses in his speech. He believes that in the past series of movements, Party members and some members of the Communist Youth League were in charge of leading and transforming people's thinking, and some people took it upon themselves to be transformers, while others were seen as being transformed. Therefore, some non-Party comrades have been wronged in the movement, and some have also developed the idea of "protecting themselves by being wise," thus creating a wall and a gap between the Party and the masses. This wall should be torn down by leading comrades.

Zhang Bosheng, Vice Chairman of the Xi'an Branch of the Jiusan Society, said: There are also many internal contradictions in our universities. There is a situation of blindly copying and applying advanced experiences. For example, a certain experience was promoted in the university, where all thirty-six hours of classes per week were moved to the morning. This was originally a temporary measure taken by the Soviet Union during the war, but the Ministry of Higher Education did not figure it out and promoted it as an advanced experience.

Secondly, on the issue of democratic parties, it is suggested that full-time cadres should be set up for democratic parties. If there are few democratic parties, each democratic party can jointly equip a cadre, which can strengthen the connection with the Party and also strengthen the connection between democratic parties.

### 陕西民主人士在座谈会上向省委提出意见  要求加强统战工作　密切党群关系

    陕西民主人士在座谈会上向省委提出意见
    要求加强统战工作　密切党群关系
    本报西安18日电　17日，中共陕西省委会邀请陕西省级各民主党派和无党派民主人士举行座谈。在会议上发言的共有九人，他们对统战工作、党与非党的关系以及省委领导上的问题等，提了很多意见。对于这些意见中能够答复的，省委第一书记张德生都随时作了答复，有些一时弄不清楚的问题，也提出一定在这次整风中进行处理。张德生并请大家大胆对党的工作提出批评，帮助党进行整风。
    民盟省委员会主任委员韩兆鹗说：我感到陕西省的统战工作是上紧下松，省上重视，县上就差一些；省委重视，而行政部门就差一些。如省人民委员会，只能看到行政关系，看不到统战关系。
    党和非党的关系也有很多问题，有人说：党员是“鹤立鸡群！”是“举动冷冰冰，说话哼哼哼。”个别党员甚至还挑拨是非，弄的互相有意见。如有一个厅长年纪大，提出坐吉普车不方便，要换卧车；我说年纪老的人很多，要解决应该通盘考虑。结果就有人把我说的话告诉了这个厅长，他还说：“大家都同意了，就是韩不同意”，弄得我和这个厅长之间很不愉快。
    另外，机关党有宗派主义。有些党员干部年年升级，还有一年连升两级的，几年间，有的连升三级，甚或连升五级。至于是否称职就不管了。如果“才不足以理事，德不足以服众”，那就会越升得高越坏。有些党员在机关里不钻研业务，但是“指挥欲”很强。
    民革省委员会主任委员孙蔚如说：统战工作是上紧下松，下边有些人员连民主党派的性质都不知道。希望以后加强统战工作的教育。
    九三学社西安分社主任委员候宗濂说：我认为学校里有宗派主义倾向。比如我们西安医学院派教师到苏联留学，我强调派思想进步、业务能力强、身体健康的教师去。但是学校并没有这样办，而只是派了党员去。我查问这件事情的时候，副院长说这是西安市委批准的。但是，西北大学和西安建筑工程学院都派有民盟盟员教师去留苏，可见我们学校是有宗派主义倾向的。
    民盟省委员会副主任委员李子健就民主党派在学校的作用发表了意见。他说：民盟这几年在学校，特别是在高等学校，确是作了很多工作，发生了不小的作用。比如在西北农学院就做出了显著的成绩。其原因，主要是那里的党组织很重视，也要求民盟组织做出成绩来。但有些学校便不尽如此。
    民建西安市分会主任委员韩望尘说：在工商联合会的工作中，党和非党关系问题也很多。陕西省工商联合会中党和非党人士没有建立起感情，非党人士说了话不算数。在公私合营企业中，也存在着歧视私方人员的现象。如西安大华印刷厂有个公方代表在会上对私方人员宣布，现在要整风了，你们每人先写一份自传交上来。长安县某公私合营商店李增华在讲习班学习回来，要在会上讲一下学习心得，但是公方代表却宣布说，现在让李经理向大家检讨他过去的错误。弄得李本人和职工们都莫名其妙。
    民进省委员会主任委员李祥生说：在发展组织方面，民主党派遇到不少困难。有些党组织对民主党派的关怀和信任还很不够。如民进有些基层组织一般都能主动争取党的领导，但是常常都得不到具体帮助。因此一些基层组织的成员感到不满意。
    民盟省副主任委员成柏仁当面对省委第一书记提出批评，他说：张德生书记鼓励我提意见，我就对张书记提几点意见。我认为张书记为人和蔼、谦虚，善于接近人，几年来领导陕西省的工作有很大的成绩。但是，这不等于没有缺点。我感到张书记的第一个缺点是思想不够锐敏，行动有些迟缓。第二，张书记在领导方法上，缺少大胆的、创造性的和多式多样的精神，有一般化的缺点。第三，我希望张书记要下决心跳出事务圈子，集中精力研究一些重大问题。
    民盟省委员会副主任委员袁若愚在发言中谈到党群之间形成墙的原因。他认为，在过去一系列的运动中，党员和部分团员作领导和改造思想的工作，有些人就自命为改造者，而把另一些人却看成是被改造者。因此，有些非党同志在运动中受了委屈，也有些人产生了“明哲保身”的思想，因而党和群众之间产生了墙和沟。这个墙应该由领导同志去拆。
    九三学社西安分社副主任委员张伯声说：在我们高等学校里也有很多内部矛盾。在推广先进经验时，有死搬硬套的情况。比如大学里曾推广一种经验，一星期三十六个钟头的课全挪在上午的时间。这本来是苏联在战争时期的一个临时措施，但是高教部未弄清楚，就当作先进经验来推广。
    其次在民主党派的问题上，建议能设民主党派的专职干部，如果民主党派少，各民主党派可以合起来配备一个干部，这样可以加强和党的联系，也可以加强民主党派之间的联系。
