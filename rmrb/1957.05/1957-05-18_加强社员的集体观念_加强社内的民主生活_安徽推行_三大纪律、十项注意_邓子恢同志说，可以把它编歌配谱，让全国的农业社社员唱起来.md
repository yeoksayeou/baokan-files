Xinhua News Agency, 15th -- The "Three Main Rules of Discipline and Ten Points for Attention" implemented by most agricultural cooperatives in Anhui Province are worth recommending to agricultural cooperatives nationwide. It should be set to music like the "Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention" song sung by the Eighth Route Army in the past, so that agricultural cooperative members across the country can sing it. This was pointed out today by Deng Zihui, Minister of the Rural Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, after hearing a report from Anhui Province.

The Rural Work Department of the CPC Central Committee is holding a symposium on the summer harvest distribution issues of agricultural cooperatives this year. The symposium is attended by the heads of rural work departments from eleven provinces and cities in major wheat-producing areas, including Henan, Shandong, Hebei, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Anhui, Hubei, and Jiangsu. Today, Ma Jian, director of the Rural Work Department of the CPC Anhui Provincial Committee, reported at the meeting that after the major rectification of agricultural cooperatives in Anhui Province last winter and this spring, the level of operation and management has generally improved. The experience of veteran peasants has been valued in production, and after the widespread transformation of agricultural cooperatives, there are more middle-aged and older farmers among the cooperative cadres. Moreover, most cooperatives have also hired experienced veteran peasants to form technical advisory committees. In Lu'an County, 70% of agricultural cooperatives have established technical advisory committees. This has greatly increased the enthusiasm of veteran peasants for caring about agricultural cooperatives and guiding production, and has put forward many rationalization proposals. After this year’s cooperative rectification, the general requirement made by veteran peasants in various cooperatives is that the operation, management, and production labor of agricultural cooperatives should have written disciplines that everyone abides by.

Based on this requirement and the content of the disciplines proposed or already implemented by agricultural cooperatives in various places, the Rural Work Department of the CPC Anhui Provincial Committee synthesized and proposed the "Three Main Rules of Discipline and Ten Points for Attention," which was agreed upon and adopted by agricultural cooperatives in various places. Its contents are: Three Main Rules of Discipline: 1. Obey commands in production and labor; 2. Cherish public property; 3. Implement everyone's resolutions. Ten Points for Attention: 1. Discuss matters when they arise, and everyone offers suggestions; 2. Settle accounts diligently and publicize them regularly; 3. Plan conscientiously and everyone implements it; 4. Record work reasonably and distribute fairly; 5. Study diligently and improve technology; 6. Work actively in production, and examine the work; 7. Do not be lazy or opportunistic, and run the cooperative diligently and frugally; 8. Respect the elderly and care for the young; 9. Both men and women labor, and equal pay for equal work; 10. Have good relations between cadres and the masses, and the whole cooperative is united and firm.

Deng Zihui said: This is a very good creation. Agricultural cooperatives need such a "Three Main Rules of Discipline and Ten Points for Attention" regulation. It can educate cooperative members, strengthen their collective ideology and democratic life, making agricultural cooperatives more consolidated and production more orderly. The content can be made more substantial and practical according to the specific circumstances of various places. It is best to compose it into ballads using local popular tunes to make it deeply rooted in the masses.

    加强社员的集体观念　加强社内的民主生活
    安徽推行“三大纪律、十项注意”
    邓子恢同志说，可以把它编歌配谱，让全国的农业社社员唱起来
    新华社15日讯　安徽省大多数农业社所执行的“三大纪律、十项注意”值得向全国的农业社推荐，应该像过去八路军所唱的“三大纪律、八项注意”歌一样谱成歌子，让全国的农业社社员唱起来。这是今天中共中央农村工作部部长邓子恢在听到安徽省的汇报后指出的。
    中共中央农村工作部正在座谈今年农业社的夏收分配问题。参加座谈的有包括河南、山东、河北、山西、陕西、安徽、湖北、江苏等主要产麦区的十一个省市的农村工作部负责人。今天，中共安徽省农村工作部处长马健在会上汇报说：安徽省的农业社经过去冬今春的大整顿之后，经营管理水平普遍提高了一步。生产中老农的经验受到重视，农业社普遍进行改造后，社干部中壮年老年农民多了，而且大多数社还聘请经验丰富的老农成立了技术顾问委员会。六安县的农业社成立有技术顾问委员会的就占70％。这就大大提高了老农关心农业社和指导生产的积极性，提出了不少的合理化建议。农业社的经营管理、生产劳动，需要有一个大家都遵守成文的纪律，便是今年整社后各社老农普遍提出的要求。
    中共安徽省农村工作部根据这个要求和各地农业社提出的或已实行的纪律内容，综合起来提出了“三大纪律、十项注意”，得到了各地农业社的同意和采用。它的内容是：三大纪律：一、劳动生产听指挥；二、公共财产要爱护；三、大家决议要执行。十项注意：一、遇事要商量，大家出主张；二、账目要勤结，公布要经常；三、计划要认真，大家都执行；四、记工要合理，分配要公道；五、学习要认真，技术提得高；六、生产积极干，作活要考较；七、不偷懒，不讨巧，勤俭办社好；八、尊重老年人，爱护青年人；九、男女都劳动，同工要同酬；十、干群关系好，全社团结牢。
    邓子恢说：这是一个很好的创造。农业社需要有这样一个“三大纪律、十项注意”的规定。它可以教育社员，加强社员的集体观念和民主生活，使农业社更巩固，生产更有秩序。内容可以根据各地具体情况订得更充实和切实一些。最好用当地流行的调子编成歌谣，使之深入群众中去。
