    The Historical Significance of the Indian People's Uprising a Century Ago
    Peng Shuzhi
    Today marks the centenary of the Indian people's anti-British uprising of 1857.
    In this uprising, the Indian people fully demonstrated their heroic spirit of resistance against the colonialists. This uprising holds an important position both in the history of the Indian people's national liberation struggle and in the history of Asian countries' struggle for independence and against colonialism.
    From the 1850s, the movement of the Indian people against British colonial rule grew rapidly. By 1857, in every corner of India, one could sense the hatred towards the colonialists. Secret organizations were working diligently in various places. At the beginning of 1857, there were already several uprisings among the better-organized and armed Indian soldiers. On May 10, 1857, an anti-British struggle broke out among Indian soldiers in Meerut (near Delhi), and the rebel army immediately marched towards Delhi, the ancient capital of India. With the cooperation of Indian soldiers, citizens, and suburban farmers in Delhi, the Meerut rebels entered Delhi on May 11. Within a few days, the rebel regime of Delhi was established. In June of the same year, the Indian people's anti-British uprising rapidly spread to the Ganges River basin and other areas. The British colonialists were panicked by the storm of the uprising. They had to hurriedly divert troops from the invasion war against China to deal with the Indian rebels. The British colonialists who were carrying out an invasion war in Iran also hastily signed a peace treaty and turned to suppress the Indian uprising. In addition, they also transferred superior forces from Madras, Bombay, and Punjab to attack the rebels from all sides.
    The main centers of the uprising were Delhi and Lucknow. In the defense battles of Delhi and Lucknow, the rebels wrote magnificent and moving stories. Punjab was one of the bases for the British colonialists to suppress the uprising, and they sent a large number of troops from here to besiege Delhi. Starting in June 1857, the Delhi rebels fought a defensive war for more than three months. In September, they had to abandon Delhi due to overwhelming odds.
    The fall of Delhi was a heavy blow to the rebels, but the frontal battles with the British colonial punitive forces were still fiercely underway. Lucknow became the center of the uprising. The British concentrated their elite troops to attack this heroic city, and the battle continued for half a year. Due to the betrayal of the feudal lords in Lucknow, which restricted the initiative of the rebel army and suppressed the command talent of the national hero Maulvi Ahmadullah Shah, the British army finally captured the city in March 1858.
    However, the fall of Lucknow did not mean the end of the uprising. The anti-British struggle in central India did not subside. In Jhansi, the national hero Lakshmi Bai and Tantia Tope fought stubbornly. The struggle here continued until June 1858. Lakshmi Bai died heroically on the battlefield.
    Until then, the British colonialists had only captured the big cities. In the vast countryside and on the transportation lines, guerrillas launched attacks everywhere. There were still 120,000 rebels. The heroic Maulvi Ahmadullah Shah and Tantia Tope led the guerrillas, fighting in the central India area. Especially Tantia Tope, who had extraordinary military talent, launched a long-term guerrilla war in a large area of central India. However, the main weakness of the uprising was its failure to develop this movement into a thorough anti-feudal struggle. The betrayal of the feudal lords was an important reason for the eventual failure of the uprising. Maulvi Ahmadullah Shah and Tantia Tope were successively betrayed by feudal lords and gloriously sacrificed. In April 1859, Tantia Tope refused trial and calmly faced execution. The uprising ended.
    In modern Indian history, there have been many instances of heroic resistance against colonial invaders, such as the Mysore Wars led by Tipu Sultan, the anti-British struggle of the Marathas, and especially the Sikhs of Punjab, who had resolutely struck at the aggressive acts of the British colonialists. The uprising of the Santhal tribes residing in the Rajmahal hills of Bengal and Bihar in 1855-1856 also greatly shocked the British colonialists. However, in the hundred years since the Battle of Plassey in 1757, these struggles were separate from each other, and they never formed a scale as large as the uprising of 1857-1859. Therefore, historians call this event the "Great Uprising" of the Indian people.
    The purpose of this uprising was to overthrow British colonial rule. The participants in the uprising included not only peasants, handicraftsmen, urban residents, and soldiers, but also feudal lords, landlords, and merchants; not only Brahmins of the high castes, but also Shudras of the lower castes. Hindus and Muslims also forgot their past grievances and rose up against the common enemy. The women of India also joined the ranks against colonialism like the men.
    The uprising severely hit the British colonial rule in India, causing great losses to its financial and military power. Shortly after the Delhi uprising, Marx commented on this event: "If the traditional center of the Indian Empire was undoubtedly occupied by the rebels for a month, this event has had the most powerful yeast effect, completely disintegrated the Bengal army, and expanded the army's uprising and escape from Calcutta northward to Punjab, westward to Rajputana, shaking British authority from one end of India to the other."
    The people's great uprising of 1857-1859 left a terrible memory for the British colonialists, who felt the power of the Indian people for the first time. Many colonialists' writings mention this. At the same time, the uprising also brought profound influences to the Indian people. The glorious battles in the national uprising of 1857-1859, and the heroic deeds of the leaders and fighters of the uprising, have been passed down from generation to generation. Jawaharlal Nehru also said in "The Discovery of India" when talking about the uprising of 1857-1859: "...this event also has another aspect that deeply penetrates the hearts of the Indian people, especially in my own province, in towns and villages, this event is still being remembered.
    The British colonialists' fear of the impact of the uprising is also reflected in the fact that they were afraid of people writing a true history of the uprising. British bourgeois historians have written many distorted and false histories of the uprising. Many histories of the uprising were written by officers who participated in the suppression of the uprising at that time. When the book "The Indian War of Independence of 1857" written by the Indian nationalist Savarkar in 1909 was published, it was immediately banned by the British authorities, and the author was arrested and imprisoned. At that time, the world-famous writer Gorky expressed his protest against this matter. It was not until 1947 that this book was able to meet the Indian people.
    This uprising occupies an important position in the history of the people's movements in Asian countries in the mid-nineteenth century. In the mid-nineteenth century, due to the intensification of Western colonialists' aggression and exploitation, many uprisings were set off in Asian countries. The uprising of the Indian people is undoubtedly a common reflection of the Asian peoples' opposition to colonial aggression, especially British colonial aggression. Marx once pointed out this characteristic of the uprising: "The uprising of the Anglo-Indian army is inseparable from the universal hatred of the great Asian nations for British authority. The uprising of the Bengal army is undoubtedly closely related to the wars in Persia and China." We know that the Asian people have followed a common historical path and suffered common pain. When the British sailors pointed their cannons at the ancient castles of China in the Opium War, the British colonial invasion army was also marching towards the northwestern edge of India. In order to strive for national independence and oppose colonial enslavement, the Asian people also experienced a common long and arduous struggle. While the vigorous Taiping Heavenly Kingdom revolutionary movement was unfolding in China, this great uprising was also set off in India. Due to the outbreak of the Indian people's uprising, the British colonialists' invasion plans to other Asian countries (primarily China and Iran) were disrupted, thereby also supporting the struggles of these countries.
    The situation was like this: The British colonialists were then planning to take advantage of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom movement in China to launch another war of aggression. The British fleet had carried out frantic sweeping fire on the people of Guangzhou. In Britain, the Barry Milton government dissolved the parliament that did not approve of the war against China, and under the fervent chauvinistic sentiments, carried out a new election, and the forces supporting the British government prevailed. The war of aggression against China had been decided, and the British government sent an invading army to China. At the same time, the British colonialists took advantage of Iran's war against Afghanistan to launch an invasion war against Iran. In early 1857, British invading troops invaded areas near Persia. The colonialists were confident that their plans for aggression and plunder were about to be achieved, but the development of things was unfavorable to them. The storm of the Indian people's uprising made the colonialists a little sober. They understood: Losing India would bring terrible consequences to the British Empire. Therefore, the expansion plans of the fanatical colonialists had to be put away. They quickly transferred the troops stationed in Iran and en route to China to suppress the uprising in India. Thus, the war of aggression against China had to be delayed for nearly a year, and the plan to invade Iran was completely bankrupt. It can be said that the Indian people's uprising gave a very powerful blow to the British dream of expanding territory and launching colonial aggression wars.
    However, due to various conditions, the Asian peoples' struggle against colonialism could not be consciously united for a long time. This Indian uprising only supported the struggles of other Asian countries objectively. This also reflects the common laws and inevitable trends of the Asian countries' struggle against colonialism. Uniting to carry out a common anti-colonialist struggle is an inevitable result of historical development. The historical experience of the Indian people's uprising clearly shows this. Marx not only saw the close connection between the Asian anti-colonialist struggles from this, but also saw the connection between the proletariat of capitalist countries and the colonial people against the common enemy. In a letter to Engels on January 14, 1858, Marx wrote: India "is valuable to Britain, and now it is our best ally."
    Now, history has turned a new page. A new Asia has been born. The wave of anti-colonialist struggle has not only swept across the Asian continent, but has also penetrated into Africa and Latin America and all oppressed nations. The anti-colonialist struggle has received the sympathy and support of all honest people in the world. The current new situation is not easily obtained. It has gone through a long and arduous struggle process. The Indian people have achieved today's independence after experiencing countless struggles after the great uprising of 1857-1859. The Chinese people have the same feelings as the Indian people, and the Chinese people love the heroic struggle history of the Indian people as much as they love their own history. The glorious tradition of the Indian people's great uprising of 1857-1859 will always encourage the Indian people and all oppressed people to fight against colonialism and for national independence.

    一百年前印度人民起义的历史意义
    彭树智
    今天是1857年印度人民反英起义的一百周年。
    1857年5月10日，开始了印度人民的反英大起义。印度人民在这次起义中，充分表现了反抗殖民者的英勇精神。这次起义，无论在印度人民的民族解放斗争史上，无论在亚洲各国争取独立、反对殖民主义的斗争史上，都占有重要的地位。
    从十九世纪五十年代开始，印度人民反抗英国殖民统治的运动迅速增长。到了1857年，在印度各个角落都可以感到对于殖民者的仇恨情绪。秘密组织紧张地在各地进行工作。1857年初，在较有组织和手执武器的印籍士兵中，已经有了好多次的发动。1857年5月10日，在米勒特（德里附近）的印籍士兵中，爆发了反英斗争，紧接着起义军便向印度古都德里挺进。在德里的印籍士兵、市民和郊区农民的配合下，米勒特的起义军于5月11日进入德里。不几天就建立起了德里的起义政权。同年6月印度人民反英起义的行动便迅速地扩展到恒河流域以及其他地区。英国殖民者在起义的暴风雨面前，吓得手忙脚乱。他们不得不慌忙地把当时派到中国进行侵略战争的军队中途调回来对付印度的起义者。在伊朗进行侵略战争的英国殖民者，也匆匆地签订了和约，转过来镇压印度的起义。此外，他们又从马德拉斯、孟买和旁遮普抽调了优势的兵力，由各方面向起义者进行攻击。
    起义的主要中心是德里和勒克瑙。在德里和勒克瑙的保卫战中，起义者写下了可歌可泣的事迹。旁遮普是英国殖民者镇压起义的基地之一，他们从这里派出了大批军队来包围德里。1857年6月开始，德里的起义者进行了三个多月的保卫战之后，在9月间，终以力量过于悬殊，不得不放弃德里。
    德里的陷落，给起义者一个很沉重的打击，但和英国殖民者的讨伐军的正面战斗，还在激烈地进行。勒克瑙成了起义的中心。英国集中了最精锐的部队来进攻这个英雄的城市，战斗一直继续了半年的时间。由于勒克瑙封建主的背叛行为，限制了起义军的积极性，压制了民族英雄毛列维·阿赫穆德·沙的指挥才能，使得英军终于在1858年3月间，攻下了这座城市。
    但是，勒克瑙的陷落，并不意味着起义的结束。在中部印度的反英斗争并未平息。在詹西，民族英雄拉克什米·巴依和唐提亚·都庇进行着顽强的战斗。这里的斗争一直继续到1858年6月。拉克什米·巴依在战场上英勇牺牲了。
    直到这时为止，英国殖民者只是夺取了大城市，在广大的乡村和交通线上，游击队到处展开进攻。起义者还有十二万人。英勇的毛列维·阿赫穆德·沙和唐提亚·都庇领导了游击队，转战在中印度一带。特别是唐提亚·都庇，他具有非凡的军事才能，他在中印度很大地区内，展开了长期的游击战争。但是，起义的主要弱点是没有把这一运动发展为彻底的反封建斗争。封建主的叛变是起义终于失败的重要原因。毛列维·阿赫穆德·沙和唐提亚·都庇先后被封建主出卖而光荣牺牲。1859年4月唐提亚·都庇拒绝审判，从容就义。起义结束了。
    在印度近代史上，曾经出现许多次英勇抗击殖民侵略者的事件，其中如迭普·苏丹所领导的迈索尔战争，如马拉特人的反英斗争，特别是旁遮普的塞克人，曾经给英国殖民者的侵略行为以坚决的打击。1855—1856年，居住在孟加拉和比哈尔拉志摩哈山区的桑答尔部族起义，也曾使英国殖民者大为震惊。然而，从1757 年普拉西战役以后的一百年间，这些斗争都是互相分离的，它们从来没有形成一个像1857—1859年起义这样大的规模。所以历史家把这次事件称作印度人民的“大起义”。
    这次起义的目的是要推翻英国殖民统治。起义的参加者不仅有农民、手工业者、城市居民和士兵，而且也有封建主、地主和商人；不仅有高级种姓的婆罗门，而且有低级种姓的首陀罗。印度教徒和回教徒也忘记了往日的嫌隙，起来反对共同的敌人。印度的妇女也和男子一样，参加到反对殖民主义的行列中来。
    起义严重地打击了英国殖民者在印度的统治，使它的财政和军事力量受到很大损失。在德里起义后不久，马克思在评论这件事时说过：“如果印度帝国的传统中心被起义者无可置疑地占领一月之久这件事发生了最有力的酵母作用，完全分解了孟加拉的军队，把军队的起义和逃亡从加尔各答向北扩张到旁遮普地方，向西到拉吉普他那地方，从印度的一头到另一头动摇了不列颠的威权”。
    1857—1859年的人民大起义，给英国殖民者留下了可怕的记忆，他们第一次感到了印度人民的力量。在许多殖民者的著作中都谈到了这一点。同时，起义也给印度人民带来了深远的影响，关于1857—1859年民族大起义中的光荣战役，关于起义的领袖和战士们的英雄事迹，一代一代的流传下来。贾瓦哈拉尔·尼赫鲁在“印度的发现”中谈到1857—1859年的起义时也说：“……这件事还有着另外深入印度人心的一面情景，尤其是在我自己的省份中，在市镇和农村中这件事还始终在被人记忆着。
    英国殖民者惧怕起义的影响，也表现在他们害怕人们写出关于起义的真实历史的事实上。英国资产阶级历史学家，关于起义写了许多歪曲而虚伪的历史。许多起义史都是当时参加镇压起义的军官写成的。当印度的民族主义者萨瓦尔卡尔在1909年写的“1857年印度的独立战争”一书出版时，立即被英国当局禁止，并把作者逮捕入狱。当时世界著名作家高尔基曾对此事表示过抗议。直到1947年这本书才得以和印度人民见面。
    这次起义在十九世纪中叶亚洲各国人民运动的历史上占有重要的地位。在十九世纪中叶，由于西方殖民者侵略和剥削的加强，在亚洲各国中掀起了许多次起义。印度人民的起义，无疑是亚洲各国人民反对殖民侵略、首先是反对英国殖民侵略的一种共同的反映。马克思曾经指出了起义的这一特点：“英印军队的起义是和伟大的亚洲各民族所表现的对于英国威权的普遍仇恨分不开的，孟加拉军队的起义无疑地是与波斯和中国的战争密切相联系的。”我们知道，亚洲人民走过共同的历史道路，遭受过共同的痛苦。当鸦片战争中，英国的水兵把炮口朝向中国古老的城堡时，英国的殖民侵略军也正向印度西北的边缘地区进军。为了争取民族独立和反对殖民奴役，亚洲各国人民也经历过共同的长期而艰巨的斗争。在中国展开蓬蓬勃勃的太平天国革命运动时，印度也掀起了这次伟大的起义。由于印度人民起义的爆发，打乱了英国殖民者向亚洲其他国家（首先是中国和伊朗）的侵略计划，从而也支援了这些国家的斗争。
    情况是这样的：英国殖民者当时正想利用中国太平天国运动的机会，发动又一次侵略战争。英国舰队曾向广州的人民进行了疯狂的扫射。在英国，巴里米尔顿政府解散了不赞成对中国作战的国会，在狂热的沙文主义的情绪下进行了新的选举，拥护英国政府的势力占了上风。发动侵略中国的战争已经决定了，英国政府向中国派出了侵略军队。同时，英国殖民者又利用伊朗对阿富汗进行战争的机会，也发动了侵略伊朗的战争。1857年初，英国侵略军队侵入波斯附近的地区。殖民者满以为他们的侵略和掠夺计划就要达到目的，但是事情的发展对他们是不利的。印度人民起义的暴风雨，使殖民者的头脑有些清醒了。他们懂得：失掉了印度将会给英帝国带来何等可怕的结果。于是，狂热的殖民者的扩张计划不得不收起来。他们赶快调回驻在伊朗和开往中国的军队，来镇压印度的起义。于是，侵略中国的战争不得不拖延了将近一年，而侵略伊朗的计划则全部破产。可以说，印度的人民起义给英国扩张领土和发动殖民侵略战争的迷梦以非常有力量的打击。
    但是，由于种种条件，亚洲各国人民的反对殖民主义斗争在很长一个时期内，还不能自觉的联合起来。这次印度的起义，只是在客观上支援了亚洲其他国家的斗争。这也反映了亚洲各国反对殖民主义斗争的共同规律和必然趋势。联合起来进行共同的反殖民主义斗争乃是历史发展不可避免的结果。印度人民起义的历史经验非常清楚地显示了这一点。马克思不仅从此看出亚洲反殖民主义斗争的密切联系，而且也从此看出了资本主义国家的无产阶级与殖民地人民反对共同敌人的联系。1858年1月14日马克思给恩格斯的信中写道：印度“对英国是有价值的，现在是我们最好的同盟者”。
    现在，历史已经翻开了新的一页。新的亚洲已经诞生了。反殖民主义斗争的浪潮不仅席卷了亚洲大陆，而且已经深入到非洲和拉丁美洲及一切被压迫民族当中。反殖民主义斗争已经得到了全世界正直人士的同情和支援。目前这种新形势不是轻易得来的，它是经过了长期的艰苦斗争过程。印度人民正是在1857—1859年的大起义以后，经历了无数的斗争，才取得了今天的独立。中国人民和印度人民有着同样的心情，中国人民也像热爱自己历史一样去热爱印度人民的英勇斗争史。1857—1859年印度人民大起义的光荣传统，将永远鼓舞着印度人民以及一切被压迫人民为反对殖民主义、为争取民族独立而斗争。（附图片）
