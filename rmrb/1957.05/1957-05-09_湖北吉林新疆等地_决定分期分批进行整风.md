　　Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, reported: The Secretariat of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China believes that it will take about two years to carry out rectification in the province in stages and batches. The Secretariat requested that all departments directly under the provincial government disseminate Chairman Mao's two reports to every cadre before the 6th and begin rectification studies. At present, the countryside is in the busy farming season, followed by flood prevention. It was decided that the rectification movement would begin after the autumn harvest, and file study would be carried out first.

　　When leading cadres are undergoing rectification, they should convene meetings of representatives of organs and meetings of professional representatives to listen to opinions from grassroots units and the masses in the organs. For grassroots cadres in rural areas and factories, the Secretariat also emphasized the need to teach them how to correctly handle contradictions among the people. The Secretariat also decided to establish a leading group headed by Wang Renzhong, the first secretary, to lead the rectification throughout the province.

　　The Secretariat also studied the issue of cadres participating in physical labor. At present, more than 90% of rural cadres in the province have participated in production. For cadres from provincial and prefectural committees who have not yet gone to the countryside, the Secretariat instructed relevant personnel to quickly organize them, establish contact with fixed agricultural cooperatives and factories, and immediately participate in the upcoming wheat harvest and factory work.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Jilin, reported: On the 4th, the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China formed a rectification leading group headed by Wu De, the first secretary. The Provincial Committee held an enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee to discuss the central government's instructions on rectification. The meeting particularly pointed out that the rectification movement requires strong leadership, and that party members, especially leading cadres, need to improve their understanding and actively connect with the masses on the basis of continuing to study relevant documents in depth. To this end, the meeting required cadres to immediately go to the grassroots level, listen to the opinions of party members and non-party members, participate in physical labor, and advocate the method of each rural work cadre of leading organs at all levels choosing an agricultural cooperative and establishing long-term contact with the cooperative. The meeting also studied the steps and methods of rectification.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, reported: The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has begun rectification from top to bottom.

　　On the 5th, the Standing Committee of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China held a detailed discussion and deployment on carrying out the rectification movement throughout the entire autonomous region.

　　In order to lay a good foundation for the universal start of rectification in the region, the Standing Committee decided to postpone the end of the ongoing enlarged meeting of the Party Committee, and responsible cadres from various places should continue to study in depth, improve their understanding, criticize their thinking, and review their work. The meeting also pointed out that the ethnic relations in the autonomous region are an important aspect of the people's internal relations, and the implementation of ethnic policies should be reviewed in conjunction with the rectification period. During the rectification, Han cadres and minority cadres will basically be together to help each other and enhance unity. In addition, a group led by Wang Enmao, the first secretary, and Saifuddin, the secretary, was formed to lead the rectification.

    本报武汉电　中共湖北省委书记处会议认为，全省分期分批进行整风，约需二年时间。书记处要求省直属机关在6日以前将毛主席的两个报告传达到每个干部，开始进行整风学习。目前农村正是农忙时节，接着又将防汛，整风运动决定在秋后开始，现在先学习文件。
    领导干部在整风时，要召开机关代表会和专业代表会，听取基层和机关群众的意见。对农村和工厂的基层干部，书记处还强调要教给他们学会怎样正确处理人民内部矛盾。书记处还决定成立以第一书记王任重为首的领导小组，领导全省整风。
    对于干部参加体力劳动的问题，书记处也作了研究。现在全省已有90％以上的农村干部参加了生产。对省委、地委机关尚未下乡的干部，书记处责成有关人员迅速加以组织，同固定的农业社和工厂取得联系，立即参加即将开始的麦收工作和工厂的工作。
