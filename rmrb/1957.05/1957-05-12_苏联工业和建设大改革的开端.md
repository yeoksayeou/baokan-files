    The Beginning of the Great Reform of Soviet Industry and Construction
              By our reporter Li He
    The Fourth Session of the Seventh Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union passed the law on improving the organization of industrial and construction management, completing its historical task. This meeting was held immediately after a month of nationwide discussion, and it was in fact a summary of the nationwide discussion. Precisely because the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union had given more consideration to the reform of economic management, and precisely because more than 40 million workers participated in this nationwide discussion (more than 2 million people made comments), the problem was clearly presented and the situation was ripe. Therefore, at this Supreme Soviet meeting, such complex economic management issues could be successfully decided in four days.
    Thirty-two representatives spoke at this Supreme Soviet meeting. Like the tens of thousands of people who participated in the nationwide discussion, they unanimously agreed to establish economic regions, set up national economic committees in the economic regions, and shift the center of gravity of industrial and construction management to them. They believe that taking this path can thoroughly overcome departmentalism derived from the leadership principle of specialized ministries, can widely realize the specialization and collaboration of industrial enterprises, and can enable leaders to go deep into the lower levels, get close to production, and concretely help enterprises.
    There was no dispute regarding giving play to the independence and initiative of local areas. However, both the rapporteur and speakers emphasized that while enhancing the role of local areas, it is necessary to prevent the emergence of localism. Local organizations must put issues of all-Soviet significance first, must first pay attention to the development of industrial sectors related to the entire Soviet Union, and must be concerned about expanding economic ties with other regions. Bikov, a high-speed cutting worker from Moscow, criticized the phenomenon of localism that had already been felt in his speech. The hydraulic lathes used in his factory are supplied by the Kharkov "Hydraulic Transmission Machine" factory. This specialized factory recently received instructions from local leaders to step up the supply to its own future economic region, regardless of the needs of other regions for hydraulic machines.
    The representatives debated more on whether certain industrial ministries of the Soviet Union and the republics should be abolished or retained. People finally agreed to retain certain industrial ministries and hand over the enterprises under their jurisdiction to the National Economic Committee for management. In this way, on the one hand, it can ensure centralized supervision of important industrial sectors such as the defense industry; on the other hand, it will not hinder the role of the National Economic Committee.
    From the nationwide discussion and the Supreme Soviet meeting, it is not difficult to see that just as the retention of certain industrial ministries does not restrict the independence and initiative of local areas and the masses, the establishment of 92 economic regions throughout the Soviet Union is not to cancel but to strengthen democratic centralism. Because after the center of gravity of economic management shifts to the local level, national planning, finance, statistics, etc. will still be centralized, and a new atmosphere will inevitably emerge at that time, that is, a unified, centralized, and planned leadership will be well combined with the broad initiative and creativity of local areas and the masses.
    The law on improving the economic management system has been passed, and the great reform of Soviet industry and construction has begun. In the past three years, the Soviet Party and government have made great achievements in further developing agriculture. One of the most important reasons is the improvement of agricultural leadership, making the leadership close to production. Now the same is being done in industry and construction. Soviet agriculture used to have great shortcomings, while the industrial situation has always been very good. Therefore, this major reform will undoubtedly open up huge prospects for the development of productive forces. Comrade Khrushchev said when he met with Chinese journalists a few days ago: This reorganization is to greatly increase production on the basis of the original industry, and there will be a climax of equipping Soviet industrial enterprises with the latest technology.
    An intense reorganization will take place in May and June. This is the beginning of the great reform of Soviet industry and construction. (May 10)

    苏联工业和建设大改革的开端
              本报记者　李何
    苏联最高苏维埃第四届第七次会议通过了改进管理工业和建设的组织工作的法律，完成了自己的历史任务。这次会议紧接着一个月的全民讨论之后举行，它事实上是全民讨论的总结。正因为苏共中央和苏联部长会议对于经济管理的改组问题作过较多的考虑，正因为有四千多万劳动者参加了这次全民讨论（二百多万人提出了意见），问题摆得很清楚，事情已经成熟，所以在这次最高苏维埃会议上能够以四天时间顺利地决定了那么复杂的经济管理问题。
    在这次最高苏维埃会议上有三十二位代表发言。正如参加全民讨论的成千成万人们，他们一致赞成建立经济区，在经济区里设置国民经济委员会，把工业和建设的管理重心移交给它们。他们认为：走这条道路，可以彻底地克服从专业部领导原则派生的本位主义，可以广泛地实现工业企业的专业化和协作，可以使领导深入下层接近生产和具体地帮助企业。
    在发挥地方的独立性和积极性方面，人们是没有争论的。不过报告人和发言人都强调：在提高地方的作用的同时，要防止地方主义的产生，地方机构必须把具有全苏意义的问题放在第一位，必须首先注意发展关系全苏的工业部门，必须关心扩大和其他地方的经济联系。莫斯科高速切削工人贝科夫在发言中批评了已经感觉到的地方主义的现象。他的工厂所用的液压车床，是由哈尔科夫“液压传动机”工厂供应的。这个专业化的工厂最近竟从地方的领导者得到指示，不管其他地区对液压机的需要，而去加紧供应自己的未来经济区。
    对于全苏和共和国的某些工业部应该撤销或者保留，代表们争论比较多。人们最后同意保留某些工业部而把它们所辖的企业都交国民经济委员会管理。这样一方面可以保证对于像国防工业等等重要的工业部门的集中监督；另一方面可以不妨碍国民经济委员会的作用。
    从全民讨论和最高苏维埃会议上不难看出：正如某些工业部的保留，并不限制地方和群众的独立性和积极性一样，在全苏联设立九十二个经济区，并不是取消而是加强民主集中制。因为在经济管理重心移到地方以后，全国计划、财政、统计等等仍然是集中的，到时势必出现一种新的气象，那就是，统一的、集中的、有计划的领导与地方和群众的广泛的积极性和创造性很好地结合起来。
    改进经济管理制度的法律通过了，苏联工业和建设的大改革开始了。最近三年来苏联党和政府在进一步发展农业方面取得了巨大的成就，最重要的原因之一是改进了农业的领导，使领导接近生产。现在工业和建设方面也这样做。苏联农业以往有很大缺点，而工业情况一直很好。因此这次大改革，无疑地将为生产力的发展打开巨大的远景。赫鲁晓夫同志日前接见中国新闻工作者的时候说：这次改组就是要在原有的工业基础上大大提高生产，将会有一个以最新技术装备苏联工业企业的高潮出现。
    一场紧张的改组工作将在5、6月中进行。这是苏联工业和建设大改革的开端。（5月10日）
