Baoji, May 17th (from this newspaper) – What are the experiences of medium-sized new industrial cities in carrying out urban construction work in accordance with the principle of diligence and thrift in nation-building? The new urban planning schemes of Baoji and Xingping provide good experience.

Baoji and Xingping are both emerging industrial cities, and will respectively build about five to ten new factories, with the population developing to more than one hundred thousand and two hundred thousand. The original urban planning schemes of these two places mechanically transported some foreign and large-city standards and quotas, with shortcomings such as excessive scale, excessive land occupation, excessively high standards, and excessive eagerness for novelty. Recently, the urban construction departments of Shaanxi Province and the working group of the Urban Design Institute of the Ministry of Urban Construction jointly revised the urban planning schemes of these two places. On the basis of the state's appropriate tightening of the industrial construction scale in the two places, the new scheme, according to the local economic situation and the people's living standards, reduced the planning and construction standards and quotas in the spirit of making do with whatever is available and building the country diligently and thriftily. The new scheme saves the state about 200 million yuan in total urban construction investment for the two places compared with the old scheme.

In the original urban planning schemes of these two places, the per capita living area was calculated according to nine square meters, and with the population scale being too large, the city scale was unduly expanded, increasing urban construction costs. In order to provide a large amount of urban land, Baoji City needed to carry out large-scale flood control projects and projects to lower the groundwater level in conjunction with the management of the Wei River. Xingping County also felt that there was insufficient urban land. However, this living area index is not compatible with China's current economic level and is far from the living standards of the local people. The current living area of residents in Baoji City is only 2.7 square meters per person. The new schemes in both places have reduced the living area quota, only requiring a gradual small increase in the living standard. The building density of houses has been increased appropriately, taking into account fire prevention and hygiene requirements. The land area for roads, public buildings, and greening has also been appropriately compressed. As a result, the per capita living area has been reduced a lot, the problem of insufficient urban land has been solved, and a large amount of land has been saved. Comparing the old and new schemes, the two places saved urban land by 15,000 mu and more than 12,000 mu respectively.

The original schemes in both places required the construction of a large number of expensive mixed-structure three-story buildings. However, many local residents now live in adobe bungalows or even cave dwellings, and many shops in Xingping County also use brick-column adobe wall structures for their two-story buildings. The new schemes in both places have reduced the proportion of three-story buildings to 10% and 15% respectively. These buildings will be constructed with mixed structures or brick-wood structures; the rest will be brick-column adobe bungalows and brick-column adobe wall or earth-wood structure two-story buildings. This not only saves the state a lot of money, but also ensures that the new buildings are not too far from the living standards of local residents.

After the building standards of houses are lowered, sanitary and welfare facilities can also be simplified. General residential areas in both places will use wells instead of tap water; a small number of three-story buildings will be connected to tap water pipes in combination with industrial water use. The amount of sewage will also be reduced accordingly, and sewage treatment can be simplified. Baoji and Xingping will no longer build large sewage treatment plants and will reduce the construction of drainage pipes.

In the new schemes of both places, it is proposed to make full use of the buildings and public facilities in the old city, and the old city will no longer be renovated. As a result, Baoji can demolish 70,000 square meters less of residential buildings; Xingping can demolish 17,000 square meters less of residential buildings.

In the new scheme of Baoji City, it is also decided to construct in phases and sections according to the terrain. In the near future, several independent residential areas will be built near the factories first, without forcing them to be connected into one piece.

The person in charge of the Urban Construction Bureau of Shaanxi Province told reporters: In the future, many medium-sized new industrial cities will appear in construction. These cities should start from reality, make do with whatever is available, and build diligently and thriftily. In this regard, the new urban planning schemes of Baoji and Xingping can be used for other regions to study and refer to.

    宝鸡兴平降低城市建设标准
    节省资金两亿元，减少用地近三万亩
    本报西安17日电　中等规模的新工业城市怎样根据勤俭建国的方针进行城市建设工作？宝鸡、兴平的新城市规划方案提供了良好的经验。
    宝鸡、兴平都是新兴工业城市，将分别新建五个到十个左右的工厂，人口将发展到十几万、二十几万。这两地原来的城市规划方案，机械地搬运了一些国外和大城市的标准、定额，存在着规模过大、占地过多、标准过高、求新过急的缺点。最近，陕西省城市建设部门和城市建设部城市设计院的工作组一起，将这两地的城市规划方案作了修改。在国家适当紧缩两地工业建设规模的基础上，新方案根据当地的经济情况和人民生活水平，按照因陋就简、勤俭建国的精神，降低了规划、建设的标准、定额。两地城市建设总投资，新方案比旧方案为国家节约资金约两亿元。
    这两个地方原来的城市规划方案中，每人居住面积都按照九平方公尺计算，加以人口规模偏大，便不适当地扩大了城市的规模，增加了城市建设费用。宝鸡市为了提供大量的城市用地，需要结合治理渭河，进行大规模的防洪工程和降低地下水的工程。兴平县也感觉城市用地不足。但是，这个居住面积指标同我国当前的经济水平不相适应，同当地人民生活水平也距离很远。宝鸡市居民现在的居住面积，每人仅是二点七平方公尺。两地新方案中都降低了居住面积定额，只要求将居住水平逐步作少量提高。房屋建筑密度都在适当照顾防火、卫生要求的条件下作了提高。道路、公共建筑、绿化等用地面积也适当压缩。每人生活居住用地面积因此都减少很多，城市用地不足的问题因而迎刃而解，而且节约了大量土地。新旧方案对比，两地节约城市用地分别达一万五千亩和一万二千多亩。
    两地原方案中都要修建大量造价昂贵的混合结构的三层楼房。但是当地居民现在许多都住土坯平房甚至窑洞，兴平县城不少商店的二层楼房也采用砖柱土坯墙结构。两地新方案中分别把三层建筑的比例降低为10％和15％，这些建筑将采用混合结构或砖木结构；其余都修建砖柱土坯平房和砖柱土坯墙或土木结构的二层建筑。这样既为国家节约大量资金，又使新建房屋不至距离当地居民生活水平太远。
    房屋建筑标准降低以后，卫生福利设施也可以因陋就简。两地一般居住区都将用水井，不用自来水；少数三层楼房分别结合工业生产用水安装自来水管。污水量也相应减少，污水处理可以简化。宝鸡、兴平都不再修建大的污水处理厂，并将少修排水管道。
    旧城的建筑物和公共设施，两地新方案中都提出要尽量加以利用，旧城不再进行改建。宝鸡因此可少拆七万平方公尺的住宅；兴平可少拆居住建筑一万七千多平方公尺。
    宝鸡市新方案中，还决定根据地形分期分片建设，近期内先在靠近工厂的地方修建若干独立的住宅区，不强求连成一片。
    陕西省城市建设局负责人对记者说：今后建设中将出现许多中等规模的新工业城市。这些城市更应该从现实出发，因陋就简，勤俭建设。在这方面，宝鸡、兴平的新城市规划方案可供其他地区研究参考。
