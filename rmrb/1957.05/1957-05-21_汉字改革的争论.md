    The Debate on Chinese Character Reform
    (Our dispatch) The Chinese Writing Reform Committee invited some members of the academic community on the 16th and 20th to discuss the issue of writing reform. Vice Chairman Hu Yuzhi said that both the Chinese character simplification plan and the Pinyin plan have been discussed by the CPPCC, but it is still not enough to solicit opinions from various parties. Writing reform is a major event and requires soliciting opinions from various parties.
    Whether or not to reform Chinese characters? This question sparked a debate. Tao Kun of the Compilation Committee of the Academy of Sciences said, "I don't understand the basic principles of writing reform, so I don't agree with writing reform. There are many documents on writing reform, but I can't find any facts in them to prove that the difficulty in recognizing Chinese characters is a reason for reform. Difficulty in writing is also not a problem. Having difficulty with typing requires reform, which is a technical problem and cannot be considered a reason. We can't find any reason to say that hieroglyphs are backward. I am not against writing reform, but I don't know the reason for reform, so I don't agree with writing reform. If writing is merely a tool for recording language, then we can do without writing, and all books and periodicals can be done with audio tapes. Chinese characters have many advantages, such as 'photosynthesis.' As the name suggests, it is clear at a glance. If Pinyin writing directly uses foreign words, those outside the field will not understand."
    Chemist Yuan Hanqing and others disagreed with Tao Kun's opinion. They believe that Chinese characters are a backward form of writing with a very low usage rate, and the reform of Chinese characters is a necessary result of the development of Chinese characters. Language is constantly developing, and writing is also developing along with it. The same is true of Chinese characters. For thousands of years, Chinese characters have made brilliant contributions to the scientific and cultural development of our country, and they are still continuing to contribute their strength now and in the future. However, now, in the great socialist construction, on our road to science and culture, Chinese characters have brought us many difficulties, so we must carry out Chinese character reform. Chinese character reform is not about reforming the language; language cannot be reformed by artificial means. From the perspective of meeting the needs of our great socialist society, Chinese characters must be reformed. Professor Jian Bozan, a historian, said, "From my personal interest, writing reform is a bit inconvenient for me, but I can't think that way. For the benefit of the broad masses of the people, I am in favor of phonetic writing." He said that writing is a product of history, and reform is a process of historical development. Now that we have grasped the laws of historical development, it is entirely possible to artificially accelerate the process of writing reform, but it is not an easy thing, and it needs to be discussed carefully. Don't rush it, take it slowly. Ma Xueliang, director of the Chinese Language Department of the Central University for Nationalities, said that according to the feedback I have collected from ethnic minorities, all ethnic minorities support the direction of Chinese language towards phonetic writing. However, the Chinese Pinyin scheme has shortcomings and does not take into account the convenience of learning for ethnic minorities. They also have difficulty using this scheme to create their own national writing. Many experts and scholars who support Chinese Pinyin writing said that the direction of Chinese towards Pinyin has great significance for popularizing culture. They also suggested that the Chinese scheme should be published and implemented on a trial basis as soon as possible, and opinions from the masses should be widely absorbed to revise it.
    Philologist Tang Lan said that he is in favor of writing reform and also in favor of phonetic writing. But he believes that Chinese characters should not be reformed using foreign writing systems, but should be reformed from Chinese characters themselves, developed according to the laws of Chinese character development, and new writing should not be created to replace them. Writing reform needs to be done slowly, and it should not be rushed. It may be a good idea to delay the time by twenty or thirty years.
    The symposium will continue to be held after this session.

    汉字改革的争论
    本报讯　中国文字改革委员会在16、20两日，邀请一部分学术界人士座谈文字改革问题。胡愈之副主任说，汉字简化方案和拼音方案都经过政协讨论，但是多方面征求意见仍然是不够的。文字改革是一件大事，需要征求多方面的意见。
    汉字要不要改革？这个问题引起了争论。科学院编译委员会陶坤说，我对文字改革的基本原则不了解，因此我不同意文字改革。文字改革的文献很多，但从里面找不出什么事实能证明汉字难认是改革的理由。难写也不是问题。打字不好打就要改革，这是技术问题，也不能算作理由。我们找不出任何理由说明象形文字是落后的。我并不反对文字改革，但是我不知道改革的理由，所以我不同意文字改革。如果文字仅仅作为是记录语言的工具，那么，我们可以不要文字，所有书刊都用录音带好了。汉字有许多优点，如“光合作用”，顾名思义，一看就明白，如果拼音文字直接用外来语，隔行人就不明白。
    化学家袁翰青等都不同意陶坤的意见。他们认为汉字是一种落后的文字，使用率很低，汉字必须改革，是汉字发展的必然结果。语言是不断向前发展的，文字也是跟着不断向前发展的。汉字也是如此。几千年来，汉字对我国的科学和文化发展有着光辉的贡献，而且，现在、将来还是在继续贡献它的力量。但是，现在在伟大的社会主义建设中，在我们向科学和文化进军的道路上，汉字给我们带来了不少的困难，所以我们要进行汉字改革。汉字改革并非是改革语言，语言是不能用人为的方法来改革的。从适应我们伟大的社会主义社会建设的需要来说，汉字必须要改革。历史学家翦伯赞教授说，从我个人利益来说，文字改革与我有些不方便，但是我不能这样去想。为了广大人民的利益，我赞成拼音文字。他说，文字是历史的产物，改革是历史发展的过程。现在，我们掌握了历史发展规律，人为地加速文字改革的过程，是完全可能的事情，但不是容易的事情，需要好好地讨论，不要快，慢慢地来。中央民族学院语文系主任马学良说，根据我在少数民族中收集到的反映，所有少数民族都拥护汉语走拼音文字方向。但是汉语拼音方案有缺点，没有照顾到少数民族学习的方便。他们利用这个方案来创造本民族的文字也有困难。许多赞成汉语拼音文字的专家学者说，汉语走拼音方向对普及文化方面具有重大的意义。他们并提出汉语方案应及早公布试行，广泛吸收群众意见来修正。
    文字学家唐兰说，他赞成文字改革，也赞成拼音文字。但他认为不应该用外国文字系统来改汉字，应从汉字本身来改革，按照汉字发展的规律来发展，不能创造新的文字来代替。文字改革需要慢慢地来，不能操之过急，不妨把时间拖长二十年或三十年。
    座谈以后将继续举行。
