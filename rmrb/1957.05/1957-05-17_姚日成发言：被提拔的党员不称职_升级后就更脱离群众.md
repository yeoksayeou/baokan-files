Yao Richeng's Speech:
    Promoted Party Members are Incompetent; After Promotion, They Become Even More Detached From the Masses

    Very Incompetent Party Members Are Also Promoted
        Those in Personnel Departments Are Promoted Even Faster

    In many companies, the promoted section chiefs are overwhelmingly Party members. In our company, none of the section chiefs promoted last year were non-Party members.

    Those who are sent to study are also Party and League members. There was a Party member who was promoted from clerk to staff member in 1955 and then promoted to chief staff member in 1956. Because he was incompetent and the masses had complaints, he was sent to study.

    When promoting and cultivating people, you also have to see if they have the qualifications. Here, it's: clearly those who are very不行 (not good/incompetent), but they have to be promoted.

    Among the cadres sent abroad, except for the technical personnel, almost none are non-Party members. Even the drivers sent abroad have to be Party members.

    Last year, when preparing to send someone to the Soviet Union to inspect our work there, it was originally decided to send a non-Party member with the section chief, but the Personnel Bureau disagreed. Those working in the personnel departments are promoted quickly. Everyone in the Personnel Bureau is a first-class staff member; there are no ordinary staff members. So, everyone says they are "the first to enjoy the moonlight by being near the water."

    There are also problems in the use of cadres. Those who know foreign languages are assigned to administrative work. The Foreign Trade Institute wants to hold foreign language classes; why not use the people here who already have a foundation in foreign languages? To alleviate the current urgency, why not appropriately adjust their work?

    An administration section employee who knows foreign languages and has studied engineering is assigned to manage the service personnel (civil servants). On the cadre registration form, they fill in their expertise, but their work isn't adjusted. Is it that the Party doesn't trust them?

    Leading Cadres Live Special Lives; Section Chiefs Have "Special Tables" for Meals

    In the ministry, there are contradictions between superiors and subordinates and between leaders and the masses. Leading cadres live special lives and are detached from the masses. Bureau-level cadres live in high-grade dormitories, eat in small-灶 (small kitchen/special) canteens, go home by car, and only come into contact with section chiefs and staff members, with no opportunity to get close to the masses.

    The company is basically the same. The north building of the import building is reserved for cadres above the section chief level. Some north-facing rooms are clearly empty, but non-section chief level cadres who want to get married and need a room can't even borrow them for a few days. The grain and oil export company's cafeteria has a separate small room for section chiefs to eat in. Later, the small room was moved to other uses, and a table was set aside in the area where the masses eat as a "section chief special table." The masses are very dissatisfied with this and demand the cancellation of this "special table," but they are criticized for "egalitarianism."

    In the use of furniture, it's also stipulated what level of cadre uses what. Even if the section chief doesn't want a wardrobe, it has to be given. People below the level of first-class staff member are not given bookshelves, even if they have books, while others use bookshelves to display bowls.

    In terms of welfare benefits, they try to take care of the leaders in various ways. It's said that the leading cadres suffered in the past and have meager savings. I don't think that's the case now. The really struggling comrades asked for a subsidy of six yuan during the Spring Festival last year, but they only agreed to give five yuan, which made this comrade unhappy even after receiving the subsidy. It is said that some elementary school students are saying to each other, "My dad is a section chief, your dad is a staff member," using this to brag to each other.

    Some people say that Communist Party members are "enduring hardship first, enjoying benefits later." Because they suffered in the past, they should enjoy the benefits now.

    On the issue of wages, the treatment between the ministry and the company is also unfair. Staff members at levels 17 and 18 are very common in the ministry. In the company, there are very few staff members at level 19.

    Many of the company's ordinary cadres have not been promoted in the four years since their grades were set in 1952. However, those who were section chiefs at the time have been promoted by at least two grades by last year. Is it that section chiefs progress quickly and non-section chiefs progress slowly? The upgrading of section chiefs is done in shifts. This year it's these few, next year it's those few, and the year after that it's those few. Therefore, a section chief is promoted by at least two grades in four years.

    We keep raising opinions, but they are never changed, which is a soft resistance to criticism. Sometimes, leaders don't let people speak freely and then draw conclusions or label them.

    People in the Foreign Trade Ministry's reception department say that their wages are high, but other benefits are very low. It's reasonable for them to ask for more political help, but it's inappropriate to label them all as "egalitarians." We often say that it's okay to give opinions to the manager because there are many people, and he can't remember who gave the opinion. However, it's not okay to give opinions to the section chief. The section chief knows it's you who gave the opinion, and when the issue of raising salaries and grades is discussed later, he will say you're naughty, and you won't be able to get a raise.

    Party Member Section Chiefs Know Nothing; Staff Members Are "Officeless But Powerful"

    The promoted Party members are incompetent (not only do they not understand the business, but they also don't even have "principled leadership"), they just say whatever the manager says. Anyway, they look for the bureau chief for major issues and the section chief or staff member for minor issues. So, some people say: It's best to be a section chief. But some Party member section chiefs don't feel distressed because they are incompetent; instead, they feel it doesn't matter. They also don't feel interested in studying the business. Even if some section chiefs attend study sessions, their exam scores are not good because they are nonchalant.

    Here, non-Party cadres have office and power. This is because the section chief knows nothing. A staff member said: I am "officeless but powerful." I make decisions on some issues and hand them over to the section chief. The section chief says: "Are there any problems? If there are no problems, I'll sign." As long as I say there are no problems, that's fine. Isn't this "officeless but powerful"?

    Finally, I hope that in the future, when the company holds joint meetings of the Party, government, labor union, and League, people from the democratic parties will also be allowed to participate. Because these meetings are generally aimed at mobilizing the masses to do something, and absorbing the leaders of the democratic parties to attend the meetings will only benefit the mobilization of the masses and will not cause any harm.

### 姚日成发言：被提拔的党员不称职  升级后就更脱离群众

    姚日成发言：
    被提拔的党员不称职  升级后就更脱离群众
    很不行的党员也被提拔
    在人事部门的提得更快
    很多公司提拔的处长，绝大部分是党员。在我们公司去年提升的几个处长中，没有一个非党员。
    去学习的，也都是党团员。有一个党员，1955年由办事员提成科员，1956年又提升为主任科员。由于不称职，群众有意见，就把他送去学习。
    提拔、培养的对象，也要看他是否具备了条件。我们这里是：明明很不行的，却非要提。
    出国干部中，除技术人员外，几乎没有一个非党员。甚至派司机出国也要是党员。
    去年准备到苏联检查我们在那里的工作，原来决定由一个非党员随处长去，可是人事局不同意。在人事部门工作的，提升得快。人事局的都是一等科员，没有普通科员。所以大家说他们是“近水楼台先得月”。
    在使用干部上也有问题。会外文的，被分配去搞行政工作。外贸学院要举办外文班；我们这里原有有外文基础的人为什么却不用？为救当前之急，为什么不适当调整他们的工作？
    行政处一个懂外文的学工的人，却被分配去管服务员（公务员）。在干部登记表上要填自己的专长，他们也都填上了；但是，就不调他们的工作。是不是党不信任他们呢？
    领导干部生活特殊  处长吃饭设有“专席”
    在部里，上下级间、领导与群众间有矛盾。领导干部生活特殊，脱离群众。司局长干部住的是高级宿舍，吃饭上小灶食堂，回家小汽车一坐，上班接触的是处长、科长，根本没有同群众接近的机会。
    公司里基本上也是如此。进口大楼的北屋，竟规定留给处长以上的干部住。有些北屋明明空着，非处长一级的干部要结婚没有房，想暂借几天也不行。粮油出口公司的食堂，单有一间小屋给处长吃饭。后来小屋被移作他用，又在群众吃饭的地方辟出一桌为“处长专席”。群众对此很不满，要求取消这个“专席”，还被批评是“平均主义”。
    使用家具上，也规定什么级的干部用什么。处长不要衣橱也得给。一等科员以下的人，虽然有书也不给书架，另一些人却拿书架摆碗。
    在生活福利上，想花样照顾领导。据说是领导干部过去苦，家底薄。我认为现在并不是这样。真正困难的同志，去年过年的时候，要求补助六元，结果只答应给五元，使这位同志得了补助还不高兴。据说现在一些小学生在学校里也说“我爸爸是处长，你爸爸是科长”，以此互相炫耀。
    有人说，共产党员是“吃苦在先，得利在后”。因为过去吃了苦，现在该得利了。
    在工资问题上，部里与公司之间的待遇也不公平。部里十七、八级的科员很普遍。公司里，十九级的科员都很少。
    很多公司的一般干部，从1952年定级后，四年来没提过级。但是，当时是科长的，到去年最少提了两级。是不是科长就进步快，非科长就进步慢呢？科长升级是轮班，今年是这几位，明年是那几位，后年又是这几位；因此，一个科长四年最少提两级。
    意见老提，可就老不改，这是软性的抗拒批评。有时候领导不让人畅所欲言就作结论或扣帽子。
    外贸部交际处的人说，他们的工资待遇是高的，其他待遇却很低。他们要求政治上多帮助是合理的，一律给他们扣上“平均主义”的帽子就不合适。我们常说，给经理提意见还可以，因为人多，是谁提的意见他记不清。但是，给处长提意见就不行，处长知道是你提的，以后讨论提薪提级问题的时候，他说你调皮，你就不能提级。
    党员当处长什么都不会办事员倒是“无职有权”
    提拔的党员，是不称职的（不但业务不懂，甚至“原则领导”也不行），只是经理怎么说，他就怎么说。反正大事找局长，小事找科长、科员。所以有人说：处长最好作。但是有些党员处长并不因为自己不行而感到苦恼，反而觉得无所谓。他们对钻研业务也不感觉兴趣。有些处长即使参加学习，考试成绩也不好，因为他们吊儿郎当。
    在我们这里，非党干部是有职有权的，这是由于处长什么都不会。有一个办事员说：我是“无职有权”，有些问题我决定了交给处长，处长说：“有没有问题？没问题我就签字。”只要我说声没有问题就行。这不是“无职有权”吗？
    最后，我希望以后公司里召开党政工团联席会的时候，也让民主党派的人参加。因为这些会，一般都是要动员群众作什么，吸收民主党派的负责人去开会，对发动群众只有好处，没有坏处。
