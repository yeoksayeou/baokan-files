Editor's Note: Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in "On Contradiction": "If there are multiple contradictions in any process, one of them must be the principal one, playing a leading and decisive role, while the others are secondary and subordinate. Therefore, when studying any process, especially a complex process involving more than two contradictions, we must do our utmost to find its principal contradiction. Once we grasp this principal contradiction, all problems will be readily solved." Judging from the current situation in various localities, there are indeed multiple contradictions among the people in rural areas, and many leading cadres have recognized this point. However, not every place has yet identified and grasped which of these is the current principal contradiction. If we only recognize that there are many contradictions without grasping the principal one among them, it will be difficult to find the most effective method for resolving the contradictions. Therefore, we hope that everyone will strengthen their research and展开discussion on this issue during the rectification study; we must not only identify all specific contradictions in rural areas but also further analyze them, understand the relationships between the various specific contradictions, and grasp the principal contradiction among them.

Hubei Provincial Party Committee Holds County Party Secretary Joint Conference

Discussing Internal People's Contradictions in Rural Areas

Unanimously Believes: Many Current Internal People's Disputes are Inseparable from Bureaucracy in Leadership

(This newspaper report) The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently convened a joint conference of county party secretaries to convey and discuss Chairman Mao's report to the Supreme State Council. During the discussion, everyone focused on the current realities in rural areas and raised many noteworthy issues.

The conference focused on exploring the causes of internal people's contradictions in rural areas and the attitudes that leaders at all levels should adopt towards internal contradictions. Based on the situations presented by everyone and through the analysis of specific events, it was unanimously agreed that many disputes among the people are inseparable from bureaucracy in leadership. To resolve internal people's contradictions promptly, it is necessary to adhere to the struggle against bureaucracy, subjectivism, and sectarianism, according to the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the rectification movement. Leaders must go deeper, strengthen the ties between cadres and the masses, and strive to prevent problems from accumulating.

From the many cases presented by the county party secretaries during the discussion, the main contradictions within agricultural cooperatives are the masses' dissatisfaction with the undemocratic leadership of the agricultural cooperatives, the lack of transparency in financial matters, and the unreasonable distribution. For example, recently, more than 20 members of Laowu Township in Xiaogan County went to the prefectural committee to complain that the cooperative cadres' accounts were not public, suspecting the cooperative cadres of corruption, and clamoring to withdraw from the cooperative. After the prefectural committee sent people to investigate, the cooperative's accounts were only off by a few dozen yuan, and the general cadres were not corrupt. The problem was that the accounts had never been publicized since the establishment of the cooperative, which caused dissatisfaction and suspicion among the masses. In Qunyun Fourth Cooperative in Huanba Township, Tianmen County, due to the unreasonable assessment of winter-sown crops when the large cooperative was merged last year, the cooperative members repeatedly reported this to the township and cooperative leaders. The township cadres not only ignored it but also falsely accused the masses of being manipulated by bad elements and threatened to investigate and punish them severely, thus angering the masses and leading to collective work slowdown. After the person in charge of the county party committee conducted an in-depth investigation and clarified the reasons, the problem was quickly resolved through explanation.

Many county party secretaries believe that the political education of well-to-do middle peasants is a relatively difficult task in the current rural areas. These people have the most complaints within the cooperative, and because they often spread dissatisfaction, they will inevitably affect some ideologically backward middle and poor peasant members. In the past, most of the township and cooperative cadres adopted intimidating and repressive measures towards well-to-do middle peasants, such as saying "You want to engage in capitalism and sabotage cooperation," attempting to suppress them by "labeling" them, rather than starting from strengthening political and ideological work.

Everyone believes that the tendency of cooperative cadres to be divorced from production and the masses also arouses the masses' resentment. In agricultural cooperatives where cadres wander around and do not work for a long time, the relationship between cadres and the masses is relatively tense. Poor relations between local cadres and demobilized soldiers also often cause disputes in rural areas.

If not handled properly, folk superstitious activities and religious issues can also easily cause mass disputes. There was a temple in front of the People's Committee of Zhongxiang County, and many people came to burn incense and worship gods every day. It was difficult to stop it for a while. One cadre secretly overturned the "Buddha" at night, and the next day the masses made a big scene in front of the County People's Committee until the County People's Committee sent someone to persuade them and restored the mud Buddha before it was over. When an agricultural cooperative in Wangdian Township, Xiaogan County, was building cooperative houses, the cooperative director suggested demolishing a ancestral hall. The masses begged not to demolish it, but he refused to listen and insisted on demolishing it, which angered the masses. Similar incidents have also occurred in Mulan Mountain in Huangpi County, Sanxian Cave in Chongyang County, and other temples and places where monks and witches gather. Some cadres have privileged ideas and occupy public construction, which provokes opposition from the masses. For example, Lichuan County is a mountain city with a shortage of drinking water, and the entire city drinks water from one well. Last winter, when the drought caused the water level to drop, the county magistrate and a minister ordered that this well be used only for drinking water for the organs and water for rice processing plants, and that the citizens should all go to the Qingjiang River two or three miles outside the city to fetch water. People were very dissatisfied with this, and some sneaked into the well at night to steal water, often clashing with the police. Later, the secretary of the county party committee discovered this and rescinded the "ban."

Disputes also often occur between state-run breeding farms and fishery cooperatives, between fishery cooperatives and agricultural cooperatives, and between state-run livestock farms, forest farms, tea farms, and small mines in mountainous areas and the local masses. The use of some farmland in the suburbs for urban construction also conflicts with the interests of farmers, and if not handled properly, disputes can easily arise.

Everyone believes that cadres being high above the masses and divorced from the masses has deepened the contradictions between the people and their leaders. The most prominent of these is the large size of local organs (prefectures and counties), with most cadres bringing their families into the city, which not only creates an overstaffed leadership organ and a severe housing shortage within the organ but also reduces the labor force in rural areas. According to the secretary of the Xishui County Party Committee, some of the local intellectuals (mostly from landlord families) who participated in work after liberation have now become ministers, section chiefs, and staff members. Not only have they brought their spouses to the organ, but some have even brought their "old father," "old mother," and "mother-in-law" to live in the organ. The bureaucratic style of cadres in higher-level leading organs bringing their families, showing off, and flaunting their power in front of the masses gradually infects the district and township cadres, who "follow suit." Some township cadres in Yangxin County, even though they live only a few miles from home, also bring their wives to live in the township People's Committee. Some female township heads, after giving birth to children, insist on bringing their children to the township People's Committee and hiring nannies, even though there are people at home to take care of the children, showing that they are different from others, which also arouses the masses' dissatisfaction. These styles have recently changed somewhat, but the problem has not been completely resolved. (Qu Yifan)

### 湖北省委召开县委书记联席会议  探讨农村中的人民内部矛盾  一致认为：当前人民内部许多纠纷是同领导上的官僚主义分不开的

    编者按　毛泽东同志在“矛盾论”中指出：“任何过程如果有多数矛盾存在的话，其中必定有一种是主要的，起着领导的、决定的作用，其他则处于次要和服从的地位。因此，研究任何过程，如果是存在着两个以上矛盾的复杂过程的话，就要用全力找出它的主要矛盾。捉住了这个主要矛盾，一切问题就迎刃而解了。”从目前各地的情况看来，农村人民内部是有多数矛盾存在的，许多领导干部已经认识到了这一点；但是，究竟其中哪个是当地目前的主要矛盾，并不是每个地方都已经把它找出来，把它捉住了。如果只认识到有很多矛盾，而不把握住其中的主要矛盾，也就很难找到解决矛盾的最有效的方法。因此，希望大家在整风学习中对这个问题加强研究，展开讨论；既要把农村中各项具体矛盾都找出来，也要进一步加以分析，了解各项具体矛盾之间的关系，抓住其中的主要矛盾。
    湖北省委召开县委书记联席会议
    探讨农村中的人民内部矛盾
    一致认为：当前人民内部许多纠纷是同领导上的官僚主义分不开的
    本报讯　中共湖北省委最近召开县委书记联席会议，传达并讨论了毛主席在最高国务会议上的报告。在讨论过程中，大家着重地联系当前农村的实际情况，提出了许多值得注意的问题。
    会议着重探讨了农村中的人民内部矛盾的起因，以及各级领导对待内部矛盾应抱什么态度。根据大家摆出的情况，通过对具体事件的分析，一致认为人民内部的许多纠纷是同领导上的官僚主义分不开的。要及时地解决人民内部矛盾问题，必须根据中共中央关于整风运动的指示，坚持反对官僚主义、主观主义和宗派主义的斗争；领导更要深入，加强干部与群众的联系，力求不使问题成堆。
    从讨论中各县委书记提出的许多事例来看，农业社内部所存在的矛盾，主要是群众对农业社领导不民主、财务不公开、分配不合理很不满意。如孝感县老屋乡最近有二十多个社员跑到地委告状，控诉社干部账目不公开，怀疑社干部有贪污行为，纷纷闹着退社；经地委派员检查，这个社的账目只差二十几元钱，一般干部没有贪污，问题出在建社后从未公布账目，引起群众的不满和猜疑。天门县浣坝乡群运四社，由于去年并大社时的冬播作物评产不合理，社员几次向乡、社领导反映，乡干部不仅不予理睬，反而诬指群众受坏分子操纵，并要加以追查严办，因而激怒了群众，集体怠工，后经县委负责人深入了解，查明原因，经过解释，问题很快就处理了。
    许多县委书记认为，当前农村中比较难办的是对富裕中农的政治教育工作。这些人在社内怨言最多，而且由于他们经常散布不满情绪，必然会影响到一些思想落后的中、贫农社员。过去，乡、社干部大多数对待富裕中农是采取威吓、压制的手段，如说“你想搞资本主义、破坏合作化”等等，企图用“扣帽子”的办法把他们镇压住；而不善于从加强政治思想工作着手。
    大家认为：社干部脱离生产、脱离群众之风，也引起群众的反感。社干部东游西逛、长期不出工的农业社里，干部和群众的关系就比较紧张。地方干部和转业军人相处不好，也往往引起农村里的纠纷。
    对待民间的迷信活动和宗教问题，如果处理不妥当，也容易引起群众性的纠纷。锺祥县人民委员会门口有一座庙，每天有很多人来烧香敬神，一时难于制止，一个干部在夜晚偷着把“菩萨”给掀了，第二天群众就在县人民委员会门前大闹起来，直到县人民委员会派人出来劝解，又给把泥菩萨恢复才完事。孝感县王店乡一个农业社盖社屋，社主任出主意要拆掉一栋祠堂，群众央求不让拆也不听，坚持要拆，群众就火了。在黄陂县的木兰山、崇阳县的三仙洞以及其他庙宇、僧巫聚居之地也曾发生过类似的事件。有些干部有特权思想，霸占公用建设，招致群众反对。如利川县城是一座吃水困难的山城，全城的人都吃一口井里的水。去冬天旱水浅，城里吃水发生困难，县长便和一个部长下令，这口井只准机关吃水和加工米厂用水，叫市民一律到离城外二、三里地的清江挑水吃，并派民警看井。群众对此很不满意，有的夜间到井里偷水，常与民警发生冲突。后来，县委书记发觉，才撤销了这个“禁令”。
    在国营养殖场和渔业社之间，渔业社和农业社之间，山区的国营畜牧场、林场、茶场以及小矿山等，与当地群众之间，也常发生纠纷。城市建设使用郊区的一部分农田，与农民的利益也有矛盾，处理得不好也容易发生纠纷。
    大家认为，干部高高在上，脱离群众，加深了人民群众与领导者之间的矛盾。其中最突出的是地方机关（专区、县）机构庞大，大多数干部都要带家眷进城，不仅造成了领导机关人浮于事、机关内部大闹房荒，并且减少了农村的劳动力。据浠水县委书记说，解放后参加工作的本地知识分子（大多出身地主家庭），现在有的当上了部长、科长、干事后，不仅把爱人接到机关来，有些人甚至把“老太爷”、“老太太”和“丈母娘”也接到机关里住。上级领导机关的干部带家眷、讲排场、在群众面前逞威风的官僚主义作风，逐渐感染着区、乡干部“上行下效”地跟着学样子。阳新县有的乡干部离家只几里路，也把老婆接到乡人民委员会来住。有些女乡长生了孩子，本来家中有人照顾小孩，但她们却偏把小孩带到乡人民委员会，另请保姆，显得自己与众不同，这也引起了群众的不满。这些作风最近已经有所转变，但问题还没有彻底解决。　（曲一凡）
