Why Go to Extremes
	Shan Bai

Not long ago, the supplement of the Tianjin Daily published two articles that attracted attention. The articles were short, but they contained more than a dozen typos and misspelled words. It turned out that the editorial department had been criticized for rejecting a writer's manuscript in the past (believed to be hindering the implementation of the "Hundred Flowers" policy), so they simply published the article as it was, even retaining the typos. The editorial department only put the corrected characters in square brackets after these misspelled words, such as: ? [妨] obstructing production, not [莫] clearly [名] understanding, becoming more [愈] and more [愈] intense, etc.

When editors were criticized by writers for revising manuscripts, some editors had said sarcastically, "Then let's have an exhibition of original manuscripts and see what the original manuscripts really look like." The above practice may be said to be similar to opening an exhibition of original manuscripts. On the editor's side, the anger is vented, but it must be said that it has gone to another extreme, which is probably not good for the work and for strengthening the unity between editors and writers. Besides, are articles to be published in this way in the future? Obviously, it won't work. Recently, the Tianjin Daily received letters from readers expressing dissatisfaction with this practice, and the editorial department agreed.

This is a very individual case, but it reflects a kind of thinking that has emerged in the editorial and publishing work recently. It is entirely correct to say that newspapers and periodicals are one of the keys to implementing the "Hundred Flowers Blooming, Hundred Schools of Thought Contending" policy. However, it seems unfair if writers attribute the past shortcomings in this regard to the editors. We won't settle this account here. The question is, can we, in the future, "publish manuscripts as they are," "publish them in their original form," and "not change a single word," as some comrades advocate? Or, as some other comrades advocate, "only make textual polishing," "only correct typos," with no room for discussion? If the latter proposal is followed, readers will certainly not learn more things like "more and more intense" from newspapers and periodicals, but are the purpose and policy of our newspapers and periodicals only to teach people not to misspell words? According to the former proposal, it is of course even more problematic. As one writer put it well, our editorial department cannot become a mailing room: receiving whatever is sent, publishing whatever is received, recording everything, and the author is responsible for the content (of course, the author is responsible for writing the article, but that does not mean that the editorial department of the publication can be irresponsible). I don't know if such newspapers and periodicals exist in the world, let alone whether such newspapers and periodicals should be promoted by a country guided by Marxism-Leninism. Editorial departments must be careful and serious in handling manuscripts, eliminate personal preferences and prejudices, and respect the labor of writers. Editorial departments can only suggest to the author and make certain modifications with the author's consent if they have opinions on the manuscript. All of this is correct, but our newspapers and periodicals cannot but be responsible to the vast number of readers. Our newspapers and periodicals cannot but work for our overall goal of building a socialist society. Like all our country's work, our newspapers and periodicals are part of the socialist cause under the leadership of the Communist Party.

There are errors in editorial work, swaying "left" and right, both being attacked by bourgeois ideology and being bound by "left" dogmatism. Some editors have low levels, lack of experience, arrogant attitudes, sectarian sentiments, simple and crude methods, and some mechanical problems in implementing the instructions of their superiors. They should be reasonably criticized by writers, and editorial work should be improved, including certain working systems. Those who are incompetent should be replaced. However, the nature of our newspapers and periodicals must be firmly affirmed. They are newspapers and periodicals that serve the people under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism. Our newspaper and periodical editorial departments should first of all have the right to select manuscripts, and should not publish everything as it is. There are dogmatic problems in some of our work, but this is not a fundamental problem in the direction and line, so there is no need to make any fundamental changes. Turning away from the dead end of dogmatism does not mean going to another extreme, which is dangerous.

    何必走极端
    山柏
    不久以前天津日报副刊登了两篇文章，引起了人的注意。文章不长，却有十多处的笔误和别字。原来，编辑部因为过去退了一位作家的稿，受到了批评（认为阻碍了百家争鸣方针的贯彻），于是干脆把文章按原样登出，连错别字也保留。编辑部只在这些错字的后面，打上方括弧，括弧里注上改正了的字，例如：?〔妨〕碍生产，没〔莫〕明〔名〕其妙，尤〔愈〕演尤〔愈〕烈等等。
    当编辑受到作家关于改稿的指责时，有些编辑曾经说过一句气话，“那末让我们来开个原稿展览会吧，看一看那些原稿的真面目。”上面这个做法，也许可以说是类乎开原稿展览会了。在编辑方面，气是出了，但不能不说是走了另一极端，对于工作，对于加强编辑同作家之间的团结，恐怕没有好处。再说，难道以后就照这个办法来发表文章？显然是做不通的。最近天津日报接到了读者对于这种做法表示不满的信，编辑部表示了同意。
    这是一件极个别的例，却反映了近来编辑出版工作中出现的一种思想。说报刊出版物是贯彻百花齐放、百家争鸣方针的关键之一，是完全正确的。可是作家如果把过去这一方面的缺点都归之于编辑，看来也未必公允。这笔账且不在这里算。问题在今后，是不是今后能够像有的同志所主张的那样，“来稿照登”，“按原样登”，“一字不改”呢？或者，像另一些同志所主张的那样，“只作文字润饰”，“只改错别字”，此外毫无商量余地呢？照后一种主张办，读者固然不至于从报刊上多学会一些“尤演尤烈”之类，但是我们的报刊的目的和方针难道只是教人不写别字？按照前一种主张，当然更成问题。有位作家说得好，我们的编辑部总不能成为收发室：收到什么，发表什么，有闻必录，文责自负（写文章当然作者要负责，但不等于说刊物编辑部可以不负责）。这样的报刊不知道世上有没有，更不要说这样的报刊是不是一个以马克思列宁主义为思想指导的国家所应该加以提倡的报刊。编辑部处理稿件必须慎重严肃，必须排除个人好恶偏见，必须尊重作家的劳动，编辑部对稿子有意见，只能向作者建议并且经过作者同意作某些修改，这些都是对的，但是我们的报刊不能不对广大读者负责。我们的报刊不能不为我们的总的目的建设社会主义社会而工作。正像我们国家的一切工作一样，我们的报刊是共产党领导下的社会主义事业的一个部分。
    编辑工作是有错误，“左”右摇摆，既受到资产阶级思想的侵袭，又受到“左”的教条主义的束缚。有的编辑人员水平低，经验差，态度骄傲，有宗派情绪，方法简单粗暴，执行上级指示有些机械等毛病，应该受到作家们的合理的指责，编辑工作应该改进，包括某些工作制度在内，不能胜任的人员应该换掉。但是，应该坚决肯定我们的报刊的性质，它是在马克思列宁主义思想指导下为人民服务的报刊。我们的报刊编辑部首先应该有选择稿件之权，不应该什么都照登。我们的一些工作中有教条主义的毛病，但是，这不是方向路线上发生了根本性质的问题，因此不是要作什么根本性质的改变。从教条主义的死胡同扭转头来，不等于说要去走另一极端，这是危险的。
