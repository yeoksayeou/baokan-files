Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, May 17th. Vice Premiers of the State Council Li Fuchun and Bo Yibo spoke at a cadre meeting in Chongqing attended by more than 4,000 people on the afternoon of the 16th, discussing some of the issues they saw during their inspection of industrial and mining enterprises and urban construction in Xi'an, Chengdu, Chongqing, and other places.

Li Fuchun focused on the issues of implementing the important policy of "building the country through thrift and hard work" in various regions. Li Fuchun said that, according to what he saw along the way, the dominant impression in various places was one of vigorous construction, and the majority of cadres were working hard and living plainly; this is the main aspect. However, on the other hand, he also felt that the implementation of the "building the country through thrift and hard work" policy was insufficient in various regions. There are ten specific policy issues in capital construction:

First, the issue of technology policy. Li Fuchun said that, undoubtedly, it is necessary to adopt the latest technology in some important aspects and in scientific research, but we cannot demand that all factories and mines adopt modern technology. The current blind pursuit of mechanization and automation is worth studying. For example, in mine construction, everyone wants to build large vertical shafts. This is possible in a few locations with good geological conditions, but it is not necessary to adopt a relatively high level of technology everywhere. Currently, there are three different types of coal mines managed by the central government, provinces, and counties. The standards for central government-managed mines are the highest, with an average investment of 20 yuan per ton. Large vertical shafts with a capacity of 900,000 to 1.5 million tons average 40 yuan. The provincial-managed mines, such as in the Sichuan region, average 9 yuan per ton, while the county-managed mines average only 5 yuan. The central government-managed mines cost twice to four times as much as the local mines. If we lower the design standards and the level of mechanization a little, we can save a lot of investment and achieve faster results. Power plants are also pursuing large-scale construction, wanting 100,000 or hundreds of thousands of kilowatts, which will take five or six years to complete. However, our production level is not yet able to produce such large equipment, so we have to import it. Such a technology policy is unfavorable to us. Our technology policy should be based on the overall planning for 600 million people and our economic level. First, we should consider whether these equipment can be produced domestically, and only then consider modernization and mechanization. Our current approach is the opposite. Some factories are modernized even when it is not necessary, resulting in waste.

Second, the issue of the scale of capital construction. Currently, there is a general pursuit of large scale; it seems that only large scale counts as socialist scale. We need some modern and large backbone projects, but we cannot demand that everything be large. The scale should be determined based on resources, people's needs, and technical equipment conditions. Central and local general enterprises should mainly be medium and small-sized, with a few large ones combined with medium and small ones.

Large enterprises have new technologies, fine divisions of labor, and specialized products. From the perspective of a single enterprise, labor productivity is higher, and costs are lower. However, from the national perspective, if they are not combined with resources, sales channels, and small and medium-sized enterprises, then it is not economical, but wasteful. There is also a tendency to seek large scale in school construction. Some universities are as large as 8,000 to 10,000 people, which is rare in the world; some middle schools are large enough to accommodate 1,000 to 2,000 people. If we spread them out and run schools that can accommodate 500 to 600 people, so that students can attend school nearby without boarding, and more people can study, wouldn't that be good? The same goes for department stores. Everyone wants to build four or five stories, which are crowded on Sundays; if we spread them out and build smaller ones, people will not have to queue, and public transportation will not be crowded. Especially service industries, they should be evenly distributed to facilitate the people. The new industrial area in Xi'an is in the east and west suburbs, while the grand theaters and large stores are in the city, resulting in no one watching the shows in the grand theaters and no theaters for those who want to watch shows in the suburbs, which is unreasonable.

Third, the issue of construction standards. In general, the construction standards for both production and non-production buildings in factories and mines are too high and too large. We should advocate simplicity and frugality, spending less money to get more done. The office space of the Chengdu Cutting Tool Factory consists of several thatched houses, costing only eight yuan per square meter, and can be used for eight to ten years, which is worth promoting. Currently, housing is being built with three or four floors, costing 60 yuan per square meter. This standard should be lowered. Chongqing builds mud-brick houses with bamboo frames, costing only 15 yuan per square meter. More of these houses should be built. When building employee dormitories in cities, we should align with the living standards of urban residents; in mines, we should align with the living conditions of farmers. In this way, workers and peasants can integrate, and it will also suit the living habits of workers and their families.

Fourth, the issue of urban planning. The planning of emerging industrial cities such as Taiyuan, Xi'an, Lanzhou, and Luoyang is too large, not only modern but also at socialist standards. Some cities have a long-term plan for a living area of nine square meters per person; plus green space, the average reaches 76 square meters per person; it is estimated that Chongqing has an average of only two square meters per person, which is the best. If new industrial cities start from the current reality, the sewers and roads can all be shortened.

Fifth, the issue of land requisition. Due to the blind pursuit of high standards and large scale, generally too much land is requisitioned. Some factories have intervals of 400 to 600 meters, and workers walk one or two kilometers to and from work. The phenomenon of requisitioning too much and using too little, requisitioning early and using late, and requisitioning without using at all exists in factories, schools, and hospitals. The Xi'an Telecommunications Engineering Institute alone designed 72 lighted stadiums, which we crossed out from the design drawings with a stroke of a pen.

Sixth, the issue of self-reliance and striving for foreign aid. If we can lower the scale and standards a bit, many of our factories and mines can design themselves. We should strive for self-reliance as much as possible. Except for a few large enterprises and precision machines that are helped by the Soviet Union and fraternal countries, the equipment for general newly built factories and mines should strive to be supplied by ourselves by 70% to 80%, so that we can reduce investment and foreign exchange.

Seventh, the issue of specialization and collaboration. Both aspects must be combined. In recent years, we have paid attention to specialization and neglected collaboration. Many auxiliary workshops in factories do not need to be built. Currently, the waste caused by duplication is very large. Scientific experiments, affiliated workshops, etc., can all be arranged by local authorities in a unified manner.

Eighth, the issue of light industry construction. The construction of light industry must be combined with existing industry, agriculture, handicrafts, and people's needs for overall planning. In the future, light industries such as food and papermaking should be arranged by local authorities in a unified manner. Handicrafts should not blindly emphasize mechanization. They have thousands of years of tradition, can accommodate a lot of labor, can produce many special products, and can meet a large part of the needs of farmers. In the future, the direction of handicraft development should be based on the needs of the people. Handicraft cooperatives should not implement industry monopolies, which hinder individual handicraftsmen.

Ninth, the issue of construction bases and employee housing. Currently, there are too many construction bases, fixing the workers in place. Construction workers are inherently mobile, and they originally have their own homes. Building construction bases cannot adapt to the characteristics of worker mobility, and the arrival of workers' families also increases the urban population. Now everyone is bringing their families to the city. We must take some measures to encourage workers' families not to enter the city. It is better to implement a vacation system and allow workers to go home to visit relatives, otherwise, the dormitory problem will never be solved.

Tenth, the issue of labor and wage policies. Many issues in this area are worth studying. The unified allocation of labor and unified enrollment have caused a nationwide population migration, increasing the tension in transportation and service industries; is it better to consider recruiting, training, and allocating locally?

The apprentice system is unreasonable, and the rapid promotion has increased the contradiction between new and old workers. This system should be changed. Temporary workers must sign contracts, one month is one month, and three months is three months. In terms of wages, the main thing is that the wages of some urban jobs should be linked to the labor income of farmers, so as not to stimulate farmers to enter the city.

In addition, there are many types of welfare and bonus systems, and there are many issues worth studying.

Li Fuchun finally said that the above are just preliminary opinions, for everyone to study, debate, and refer to during the rectification campaign.

Vice Premier Bo Yibo then supplemented Vice Premier Li's speech, pointing out the three major ideological obstacles to the insufficient implementation of the "building the country through thrift and hard work" policy: First, talking about enjoyment, some people unconsciously make trouble over issues such as reputation, status, wages, and rewards; second, blind arrogance; and third, the airs of young masters. He believes that the basic key to implementing the "building the country through thrift and hard work" policy at present lies in overcoming subjectivism and sectarianism that are divorced from China's reality.

    基本建设的十个政策问题
    李富春、薄一波在重庆谈勤俭建国方针
    新华社重庆17日电　国务院副总理李富春、薄一波16日下午在重庆四千多人参加的干部大会上，分别谈了他们这次在西安、成都、重庆等地视察工矿企业和城市建设中所看到的一些问题。
    李富春着重谈了各地在贯彻“勤俭建国”这一重要方针中的问题。李富春说，根据沿途所见，各地大量的是蓬勃的建设气象，大多数的干部是艰苦朴素的，这是主要的一面；但是另方面，还感到各地贯彻“勤俭建国”的方针不够，在基本建设方面存在下面十个方面的具体政策问题：
    第一，技术政策问题。李富春说，没有问题，我们在某些重要方面，在科学研究方面，采取最新技术是必要的，但不能要求一切厂矿企业都要现代化的技术。目前盲目追求机械化、自动化是值得研究的。例如矿井建设，都要建大型竖井，少数地质条件好的可以，但并不是都要采用比较高的技术水平。现在有中央、省和县管的三种不同的煤矿，中央管的标准最高，每吨投资额平均二十元，大型的九十万吨到一百五十万吨的竖井平均四十元；省管的如四川地区，平均每吨投资额九元，县管的平均只有五元。中央管的比地方管的高一倍到四倍。如把设计标准和机械化程度降低一点，就可以节省大量投资，收效更快。发电站也追求建大型的，要十万、几十万瓩的，要五、六年才能建成，而我们的生产水平还不能生产这样的大型设备，这就只好进口，这样的技术政策对我们是不利的。我们的技术政策应从六亿人口统筹安排和经济水平出发。首先，考虑这些设备本国能不能生产，其次才是现代化、机械化。我们目前的做法却和此相反。有的工厂用不着现代化的也现代化，反而造成浪费。
    第二，基本建设的规模问题。目前一般追求大；似乎大才算社会主义规模。我们需要若干现代的、大的骨干项目，但不能一切都要大，要根据资源、人民需要、技术设备条件来决定规模。中央和地方一般企业应以中小型为主，少数大的要同中小的结合起来。
    大型企业有新技术，分工细，产品专一，从一个企业来说，劳动生产率较高，成本低一些；但从全国来说，如果不和资源、销路、中小企业相结合，那就不是经济，而是浪费了。学校建设也有求大的偏向。有的大学大到八千到一万人，这在世界上都是少有的；有的中学大到能容纳一两千人；如果分散一些办，能容纳五、六百人的学校，使学生能就近就学，不用寄宿，能多一些人读书，这不好吗？百货商店也是一样，要盖四、五层，星期日拥挤不通；如果分散盖小一些的，人民就不必排队，公共交通也不会拥挤了。特别是服务行业，要分布均匀，便利人民。西安新工业区在东西郊，而大戏院、大商店却在城里，造成大戏院有戏无人看，郊区要看戏的却没有，这是不合理的。
    第三，建筑标准问题。一般厂矿生产和非生产建筑标准都偏高偏大。要提倡因陋就简，少花钱多办事。成都刃具厂的办公用房是几幢草屋，每平方公尺只花八元，可用八年到十年，值得提倡。现在住房都是盖三、四层楼，每平方公尺六十元，这种标准应当降低；重庆盖竹泥巴墙房屋，只要十五元一平方公尺，应多盖这样的房屋。在城市盖职工宿舍，应向城市居民看齐；矿山应向农民的居住条件看齐。这样，工农才能打成一片，而且也适合工人和他们家属居住的习惯。
    第四，城市规划问题。太原、西安、兰州、洛阳等新兴工业城市规划都过大，不但现代化，而且是社会主义的标准。有的城市远景规划居住面积每人九平方公尺；加上绿化面积，每人平均达七十六平方公尺；估计重庆每人平均只有两平方公尺，这最好不过了。新工业城市如果从目前实际出发，上下水道、马路等都可缩短。
    第五，土地征用问题。由于盲目求高求大，一般征用土地都过多。有些工厂间隔距离远到四百到六百公尺，工人上下班走一、二公里。多征少用，早征迟用和征而不用的现象，工厂、学校、医院都有。西安电讯工程学院单是设计修建的灯亮球场就有七十二个，我们把它从设计图纸上一笔勾销了。
    第六，自力更生和力争外援问题。如果能把规模和标准降低一些，我们许多厂矿自己就可以设计。我们应尽可能地自力更生，除了少数大型企业和精密机器由苏联和兄弟国家帮助外，一般新建厂矿的设备应争取自己供应70％——80％，这样就可以减少投资和外汇。
    第七，专业化和协作问题，两方面都必须结合。这几年我们注意了专业化，忽略了协作。有许多厂辅助车间可以不盖，目前因重复而造成的浪费很大。关于科学实验、附属车间等都可以由地方统筹安排。
    第八，轻工业建设问题。轻工业建设必须跟现有工业、农业、手工业和人民需要结合起来统筹安排。今后轻工业如食品、造纸等，都要以地方为主统筹安排。手工业不要盲目强调机械化，它有几千年传统，可以容纳很多劳动力，可以生产很多特种产品，能满足农民很大部分的需要。今后手工业发展方向应根据人民需要来发展。手工业合作社不可实行行业垄断，妨碍个体手工业者。
    第九，建筑基地和职工住宅问题。目前搞建筑基地太多，把工人都固定起来。建筑工人本来带一定流动性，他们本来有自己的家的。搞建筑基地不能适应工人流动的特点，而且工人家属搬来，也使城市人口增加了。现在什么人都把家属带到城来。我们要采取一些办法，鼓励工人家属不进城，宁可实行休假制，允许工人回家探亲，不然宿舍问题永远解决不了。
    第十，劳动工资政策问题。这方面很多问题都值得研究。劳动力统一调配、统一招生造成全国人口大迁移，增加交通、服务性行业的紧张；是否考虑以就地招收、培养和调配为好。
    学徒制度不合理，升级太快增加了新老工人的矛盾，这一制度应当改变。临时工人必须订合同，一个月就是一个月，三个月就是三个月。工资方面，主要是城市有些工种的工资要跟农民的劳动收入相衔接，不要刺激农民进城。
    此外，福利和奖金制度，名目繁多，有不少问题值得研究。
    李富春最后说，以上只是初步意见，供大家研究、争鸣和在整风中参考。
    薄一波副总理接着对李副总理的讲话作了补充，指出“勤俭建国”方针贯彻不够的三大思想障碍：一是讲享受，有的人不自觉地闹名誉、地位和工资、奖励等问题；二是盲目骄傲情绪；三是大少爷派头。他认为目前贯彻“勤俭建国”方针的基本关键，是在于克服脱离中国实际的主观主义和宗派主义。
