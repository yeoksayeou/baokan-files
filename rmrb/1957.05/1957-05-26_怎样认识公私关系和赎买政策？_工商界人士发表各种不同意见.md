How to Understand the Relationship Between Public and Private Sectors and the Redemption Policy?
People from Industry and Commerce Express Various Opinions

(Reported by this newspaper) The United Front Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China held its ninth symposium for people from industry and commerce yesterday (the 25th). Ma Xinquan, Huang Zukang, Huang Yanpei, Wen Shaohe, Xu Chonglin, Xiang De, Wu Jiasun, Sun Fuling and eight others spoke at the meeting. In addition, Wang Dafu, Li Zhongyi, and Chen Binghuang submitted written opinions.

Huang Yanpei's Speech:

Helping the Communist Party Get Vaccinated

Huang Yanpei, Chairman of the China Democratic National Construction Association, said: We have just returned from inspections in Shanghai, Wuxi, and Nanjing. During this time of "letting a hundred flowers bloom," I should also "bloom" a bit. However, my "bloom" mainly involves "blooming what others are blooming."

"Blooming" is integrated with the Party's rectification movement. Before presenting my opinions to the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee and the Eighth Office of the State Council, let me first share my views on the rectification movement.

In 1945, I went from Chongqing to Yan'an and met Chairman Mao Zedong. Before I left, he asked for my opinions on what I had seen and heard in Yan'an. I replied: It's very good now. I thought, adding "now" after "very good" should stimulate him somewhat. Because what I have personally witnessed is that any undertaking, in its initial stages, endures immense hardships and difficulties, seeking life from the brink of death. Later, as the environment improves, it becomes arrogant, lazy, and disunited, ultimately leading to failure and extinction. I hoped to find a new path to break free from this cyclical pattern. Chairman Mao replied: We have already found a new path, which is democracy. Only by allowing the people to supervise the government and everyone taking responsibility can we prevent the evolution you described. This Party rectification movement, with its approach, feels truly necessary after I've had some contact with it in various places. Our group met Comrade Sheng Pihua on the train returning from Nanjing. During our conversation, he said: "The Party's rectification is like getting vaccinated." This sentence is brilliant! The more I think about it, the more it makes sense. We young people have all been vaccinated, and the elderly may have had smallpox. Why is my hand bent and unable to straighten? It's because the smallpox virus wasn't fully released. I have tasted the bitterness of not getting vaccinated! A person should get vaccinated in a timely manner after birth. Helping the Party rectify is like helping a loved one get vaccinated. If there's a virus inside without vaccination, the result will surely be a "flurry of smallpox" all over the body. In recent years, I have fully supported the Party's policies and guidelines. However, regarding some deviations that have occurred during implementation, I have often unceremoniously acted as a "frank friend" to offer the Party my opinions. During my inspections in Shanghai, Wuxi, and Nanjing, I deeply realized the tremendous achievements made by the Party and the government in their work, which must be acknowledged. However, I also discovered many shortcomings and problems. Now, let me address two issues that our comrades in industry and commerce are most concerned about.

Good public-private relations will certainly lead to good production; poor public-private relations make it difficult to hope for good production.

First, what our comrades in industry and commerce are currently most concerned about is how to improve the "relationship between public and private parties."

Generally speaking, the current "relationship between public and private parties" is normal. During our inspection, we adopted the method of "drilling into mines," looking at four factories in Shanghai and one in Nanjing. Some of these factories are doing particularly well. For example, in Shanghai, we visited representative factories such as the Aurora Iron Works, Shanghai Machine Tool Standard Parts Factory, Meiguang Weaving Factory, and Huacheng Electrical Factory. The public-private relations in these four factories are relatively good. Therefore, they have achieved better results in production. In Nanjing, we also visited the Datong Bed Sheet Factory. In terms of "public-private cooperation" among joint public-private enterprises in Nanjing, this factory can be considered outstandingly good. Due to the good relationship between the "public" and "private" parties, the level of production has also increased rapidly. The total output value in 1956 increased by 44.9% compared to 1955. Quality has also improved significantly. As far as we know, the Datong Bed Sheet Factory has improved its "public-private cooperation" in the following ways: 1. The responsibilities of the public and private parties are clearly defined. With certain responsibilities, the private party can proactively exert initiative. 2. Emphasis is placed on the education of private personnel, as well as on the education of Party members and worker cadres regarding the united front policy and the redemption policy. 3. The role of the Minjian (Democratic National Construction Association) branch and Minjian members is fully utilized, organizing private personnel to participate in socialist labor competitions, truly using the enterprise as a base for transforming private personnel.

These three methods can certainly be adopted by other factories as well. Some factories are not doing well because the methods they have adopted are the opposite of the above. For example, 1. The division of labor is unclear, and private personnel do not have certain responsibilities and authority. Discriminatory attitudes are adopted towards private personnel. 2. Education is conducted unilaterally only for private personnel, while Party cadres or staff and workers receive little education. Only one side is managed, while the other is ignored, thus undermining the relationship between the two parties. 3. The organizational role of the Minjian is not valued, and the importance of cultivating key members among private personnel to take the lead in accepting socialist transformation is not understood. Among these three shortcomings, the most serious is the first, namely, the discriminatory measures taken against the private party.

I see a pattern here that seems to be a rule: in enterprises, if the public-private relationship is good, production will certainly be good, unless there are special factors. Conversely, if the public-private relationship is not good, it is difficult to hope for good production.

It is necessary to correct the public's discrimination against the private; democratic parties should be jointly responsible for personnel issues.

During this inspection, I found that many joint ventures discriminated against private personnel. Some discriminatory methods were even absurd. For example, in Nanjing, one factory went to sweep the martyrs' tombs this year during Qingming Festival. After the sweeping was completed, when the head of the trade union was about to report on the life and deeds of the martyrs, he asked the private personnel to leave, which aroused great resentment among the private personnel. In Wuxi, during this year's Spring Festival, the private factory director of Xie Xin Woolen Mill was on duty and went to inspect the workshop. The head of the factory's security section actually asked the factory director to show his work permit before allowing him to enter the workshop, but did not make this request to the public deputy factory director. It can be seen how serious the discrimination of the security section's staff against the private party has become. I have also encountered such things. I worked in the Ministry of Light Industry for five years, and the relationship was very good. When the minister always wanted to do some minister's affairs, I was in charge of eighty or ninety factories, and I wanted to copy a list of the bureau chiefs and factory directors and hang it in the office. The secretary said that the Party general branch did not agree. Later, two young Party member comrades said that it could not be hung up because it had to be kept confidential. I said that the State Council would also announce the list, so what was the secret? Soon, I saw a list clearly posted in the office of a Party member director. After explaining the needs of the work, the list of bureau chiefs and factory directors was finally hung up in my office. Of course, they were all very young, and they were all loyal to the Party. It is difficult to blame them because they were not educated enough, so their thinking was biased. In addition, the same is true for the personnel system. At present, many private personnel in joint ventures, whether they are factory directors or deputy factory directors, can hardly intervene in the personnel appointment in the factory. This greatly makes the personnel appointment and cadre assessment of joint ventures one-sided, which is very bad. Generally, private personnel do not dare to speak, fearing retaliation, because the personnel power is solely in the hands of the Party. If you offend the Party, after a while, the person in charge of personnel only needs to transfer you lightly to a position that you are unwilling to be in, leaving you with no way out. Last year, I received a letter from the people requesting a job transfer. The letter was well-written, and I forwarded it to the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education. The department forwarded it layer by layer without thinking, and as a result, the unit where he was located transferred him to sweep the floor. (Now this problem has been solved, and he has gone to the countryside to be a teacher.) - The Party and the government must quickly and effectively correct these discriminatory measures taken against private personnel. I suggest that these personnel agencies can be jointly responsible by a committee composed of the Party, the administration, the trade union, and the democratic parties. I saw in the newspaper that Minister Li Weihan advocated that the Party should not monopolize the personnel issues within the Federation of Industry and Commerce. This is a very good idea that can be promoted.

Consider "removing hats" for the middle and lower levels in advance.

Second, another issue that we should be greatly concerned about at present is the issue of the livelihood and welfare of the middle and lower levels of industry and commerce. We must admit that the lives of some comrades in industry and commerce are indeed very difficult. They wear the hat of "capitalist," but their lives are quite hard. Some people's fixed interest is as little as a few yuan or a few jiao, but they are therefore unable to enjoy "labor insurance." Although they are also willing to actively participate in labor competitions, they still have concerns, fearing that if they get sick, their wages will be reduced, so they cannot fully exert their initiative. I believe that for these "private personnel" who are already substantially relying on wage labor to maintain their lives, and who also have a positive performance at work and have had significant changes in their thinking, the government should consider their "hat removal" in advance. I would like to solemnly suggest this to the government.

The long-decided method of sick leave wages has not been announced for a long time, which fully demonstrates the bureaucratic style of the "Eighth Office."

As for the issue of sick leave wages for private personnel, as far as I know, Comrade Jia Tuofu made a decision on this issue for comrades in industry and commerce as early as March of this year. However, when I inspected Shanghai, Wuxi, and Nanjing, especially in Nanjing, it was already the end of May, and comrades in industry and commerce were still generally troubled by this problem that had been solved long ago. After our investigation, we learned that although Comrade Jia Tuofu had made a decision long ago, the Eighth Office of the State Council did not promptly issue this decision in an official document, nor did it publish this decision in the newspaper, which caused widespread confusion in the industry and commerce community. I hope that in the future, all orders and notices from various departments related to people's lives will be published in full in the newspaper. The notice on contraception promoted by the Ministry of Health, which was recently published in the People's Daily, was only published in summary, so we did not have the opportunity to see the full text. It would be great if it could be published in full. On this issue, I believe that the Eighth Office of the State Council fully demonstrated its lack of concern for the suffering of people in industry and commerce, being aloof and completely bureaucratic. I believe that the Party and the government really need to change this style in the future and pay close attention to the lives of the middle and lower levels of industry and commerce.

Based on the above, we can see that the current socialist transformation of private industrial and commercial enterprises is still full of problems. Because these problems have not been completely resolved, how to further encourage industry and commerce to exert their initiative and contribute their talents has been hindered to a greater or lesser extent. As far as I know, the vast majority of people in industry and commerce are very eager to make progress. If the Party and the government can effectively improve all the shortcomings in their work, overcome their bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism in this rectification movement, then I believe that the enthusiasm of our comrades in industry and commerce can certainly be further enhanced!

But we must understand that the reason why we want to do this is, as we said at the beginning, to inoculate the Communist Party with "vaccination." The analogy of vaccination is very correct. If there are no toxins in its body, the vaccination will not work. Isn't this what Chairman Mao said, "Correct mistakes if you have them, and be on guard against them if you don't"! Our purpose is positive, in order to better enable the Party to lead us all to build our motherland into a great socialist country as soon as possible.

I personally believe that although many Party members currently have problems with bureaucracy in their work style, sectarianism in their organization, and subjectivism in their thinking, the Party's overall direction, line, and policies are completely correct. Just look at this rectification movement! Such a widespread "blooming" and "contending," comrades! Regardless of ancient or modern times, at home or abroad, can we find that space, that time, like the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mao Zedong, in today's China, not only allows everyone to "bloom" and "contend," but also requires everyone to "bloom" and "contend"! In this respect, one cannot but think it is great! I am very opposed to some people's views: saying that someone is good is almost all right and no wrong; when it is turned over, it is all wrong and no right.

The ability of China's private industry and commerce to accept socialist transformation is a great contribution of the Chinese Communist Party and a new development of Marxism in China. In this great Party rectification movement, our comrades in industry and commerce have no reason to relax their own transformation while helping the Party to carry out rectification.

I want to talk about vaccination again. Everyone needs to be vaccinated, without exception. And it must be vaccinated every year or two, until there is no reaction, that is, "Be on guard against it if you don't." I think everyone who has grown up from infancy understands this! Why is it that when Party members are being rectified, we don't transform ourselves? On the contrary, precisely because we want to help the Party rectify and overcome bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism, we should more humbly learn from the spirit of the Party's rectification movement, recognize the limitations brought about by our own class nature, and further strive in the direction of "destroying capitalism and establishing socialism."

In the past, our Democratic National Construction Association did not do enough work in representing the legitimate interests of industry and commerce and in helping the Party to transform capitalist industry and commerce. We must be frank about this. In the future, we must work hard. On this point, we also hope that the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee will not relax its leadership. If our Democratic National Construction Association has errors in thought or organization, the Party should still "not give way" to correct our shortcomings and errors. If we implement "mutual supervision," we have criticized the Party, I supervise you, why don't you supervise me? I believe that only in this way can it be called true "long-term coexistence" and "mutual supervision."

Comrades! Everyone needs to be vaccinated. The Communist Party is getting vaccinated. Don't forget to get vaccinated yourself.

Ma Xinquan believes:

The bourgeoisie handing over enterprises, external factors play a leading role

Ma Xinquan, Secretary-General of the Heilongjiang Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce, expressed his opinion on the question of whether the national bourgeoisie has two sides. He said: Some people think that we should no longer mention the two sides and class relations, nor should we draw class boundaries. They believe that the national bourgeoisie has only common ground with the working class in terms of standpoints and views, and no differences, so there is no question of seeking common ground while reserving differences. They believe that the national bourgeoisie is also the master of the country, and can share the world with the working class, be on an equal footing, and go hand in hand. I disagree with this statement. I think this statement is essentially that the leadership of the working class is not needed, which is dangerous for the progress of industry and commerce. There are also some people who take handing over enterprises as capital to bargain with the Party and boast to others. Of course, it is a sign of progress for the bourgeoisie to hand over enterprises, but they cannot be proud of it. The national bourgeoisie is not born a socialist, but due to the influence of domestic and international factors and a series of arrangements and transformation measures by the government, a general trend has been created in society, and people's hearts are turning towards it, so they handed over enterprises. I think external factors played a leading role. Some people say that they handed over enterprises "willingly," but it is more accurate to say that they were "not too reluctant."

He believes that the bourgeoisie still has two sides, but after the whole industry is jointly operated, the progressive side of the bourgeoisie becomes the main aspect, and the negative aspects are also different from before. It is impossible not to recognize this. Now some people are not wholeheartedly serving socialism, but are half-hearted, and even have resistance to socialism. Some people think that the enterprise is no longer their own, so they have a slack attitude. Some say: "The factory director, the factory director, lies in bed, borrows salary for half a month, and pays salary at the end of the month." Some people think that after the joint operation, there are three unfreedoms: first, freedom to spend money; second, freedom to go to work and leave work on time; third, freedom to operate. There are also some people who steal and sell materials, make false accounts, issue false invoices, and privately collect payments, etc. Although these people are in the minority, they are after all from our industry and commerce community and are related to our class nature. Therefore, it is also wrong to think that there is no difference from the working class.

Minister Li raised the question of whether the Party member deputy secretary-general of the Federation of Industry and Commerce is necessary. My opinion is yes, we cannot withdraw them, and it is not conducive to the work if they are withdrawn. In many cities and counties, there are some problems with the Party member secretary-general or secretary. For example, they do not respect the powers of the chairman enough, and there are some phenomena of monopolization and substitution. Some Party member secretary-generals of the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce make decisions and act alone. For example, they want to hire several part-time deputy secretary-generals from the industry and commerce community at the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce Member Representative Conference. Such important personnel issues are not discussed with the chairman beforehand. It was not until he proposed the list at the preparatory meeting of the presidium of the conference that the chairman and vice-chairmen knew about it. There are also Party member secretary-generals of the County Federation of Industry and Commerce who hold meetings of industrialists and businessmen without going through the chairman in advance. When the meeting is held, they write a report material and temporarily ask the chairman to read it out. As a result, the chairman is unwilling to be a messenger, so he does not read it. This monopolizing and substituting style still exists in a few municipal and county federations of industry and commerce. I think that the Party member secretary-general should handle the affairs of the association well under the leadership of the chairman and vice-chairmen in accordance with the regulations of the articles of association of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, respect the powers of the chairman and vice-chairmen, and earnestly give play to the collective leadership role of the committee. It should be admitted that the non-Party secretary-general has his irreplaceable role, and the Party member secretary-general also has the irreplaceable role of the non-Party secretary-general. So the Party member secretary-general cannot be withdrawn.

Huang Zukang said:

When merging factories and shops, it is necessary to consider the characteristics of overseas Chinese investment

Huang Zukang, former deputy manager of Shanghai Xianshi Company and member of the Democratic National Construction Association, said that he is a returned overseas Chinese. Overseas Chinese have always loved the motherland. Because they were oppressed by imperialism in foreign countries in the past, they remitted the money they earned in hard work back to run businesses or buy houses, hoping to return to the motherland to live and work in peace and contentment as soon as possible. Therefore, the annual overseas Chinese remittances have always been considerable. Recently, a Shanghai Overseas Chinese Investment Company was established. Although it has not been long, the amount of overseas Chinese remittances that have been remitted back is already considerable and has made a certain contribution to the construction of the motherland.

This is a good thing. However, on the one hand, we are striving for overseas Chinese investment, and on the other hand, after the joint operation, we have merged the enterprises invested by overseas Chinese before liberation, which is not conducive to striving for overseas Chinese investment. I will give two examples to illustrate: One example: There is a China Underwear Company on Nanjing Road in Shanghai, which was invested by overseas Chinese more than 20 years ago. After the joint operation, the relevant leading company merged this company into the North Station District, and even removed the brand name. This company has two managers, one in Honolulu and one in Shanghai. If the manager in Shanghai tells the manager abroad about this matter, it may arouse the concerns of overseas Chinese about investing in China.

Another example: The Xianshi Toothpaste Factory, which has a history of more than 30 years, has a total of three factories, one in Hong Kong, one in Guangzhou, and one in Shanghai. Its products are sold to Southeast Asia, Singapore, and other places. However, after the joint operation, the Xianshi Toothpaste Factory was merged, the factory name was also cancelled, and Xianshi toothpaste was no longer produced.

He said that he is not opposed to merging factories and shops, but he hopes that when merging, it is necessary to consider the views of overseas Chinese and not arouse their concerns about investment. I suggest that the government consider this issue carefully and take care of the characteristics of overseas Chinese investment.

Xu Chonglin said:

The phenomenon of non-Party people having positions but no power is widespread

Xu Chonglin, Director of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Democratic National Construction Association, said: In government agencies, enterprises, and schools, the phenomenon of non-Party people having positions but no power is quite common. I am a member of the Chongqing Municipal People's Committee. Because I do not understand the overall situation, it is difficult to speak at meetings. Each meeting lasts for half a day, and there are many issues to be discussed. These meetings are actually just formalities. Some things are done and then ratified at the meeting. Sometimes Party member committee members do not come to the meeting because the Party group has already decided on the issues to be discussed at the meeting, so it does not matter if they do not come. When I was the Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, I asked the personnel section to report on the anti-rightist situation, but they did not report it. I convened a meeting on the safety of the cable car and decided on some safety measures, but they have not been implemented to this day. If I were a Party member, it might have been done. I believe that from "design" to "construction," from "director" to "rehearsal," democratic parties should participate, so that non-Party people can do a good job. When Premier Zhou made a report in Chongqing, the capitalist people's committee members could not hear it. Party member cadres in the Chongqing Public Utilities Bureau have sectarianism and privileged thinking, and Party members are always given priority for promotion and upgrades, while non-Party cadres are difficult to be promoted. Feng Kexi, a non-Party cadre in the Public Utilities Bureau, is highly skilled and capable, but he has been the chief of the planning section for several years. I am a member of the Municipal Urban Construction Committee, and the chairman and vice-chairmen are Party members. This committee has never held a meeting. I have made several suggestions but they have not been held, which shows that the opinions of non-Party cadres are not valued.

He said that the phenomenon of non-Party people having positions but no power is inseparable from the fact that the Party and the government are not separated, the Party replaces the government, and many Party members' thinking lags behind the development of the situation, and they cannot see the progress of non-Party people. The Party and the government are not separated, from the central government to the local governments. I doubt whether it is appropriate for the CPC Central Committee and the State Council to jointly issue instructions. Some work in Chongqing is also jointly issued instructions by the Party and the government. This practice of the Party replacing the government will give people the illusion that instructions issued by the administration alone are not important work.

He criticized the Chongqing Municipal United Front Work Department for not providing enough staffing, support, and assistance to the cadres of the Democratic National Construction Association. He also believes that the United Front Work Department only unites the top and not the bottom, unites men but not women, has a narrow scope of contact, does not fully understand the situation, and sometimes the arrangements for people are not appropriate, and sometimes the problems reported are like a stone sinking into the sea, and there is no follow-up.

He said that the phenomenon of private personnel in Chongqing's joint ventures having positions but no power is also very serious. The public representative treats private personnel with "insufficient trust, insufficient support, improper use, insufficient care, and unclear division of labor; private personnel cannot put out the fire (that is, they cannot make decisions), and the public personnel have the final say." He said that the vast majority of private personnel are willing to continue to accept transformation and participate in the increase production and practice economy movement, but some people's rationalization proposals are not supported, some people cannot participate in meetings convened by higher authorities, and they cannot see documents related to their work. Some public representatives and branch secretaries manage too many things, so that private personnel have nothing to do and have no prestige among the masses. Some public representatives and Party member cadres have serious sectarianism and bureaucracy; their democratic style is poor, and when they consult, they have a real idea and pretend to discuss, putting on a face of a reformer, which makes people fearful; their work style is rude, they overemphasize class relations, and they listen to only one side; they are overly critical of the shortcomings and mistakes of private personnel, but they do not examine their own mistakes. Public representatives do not treat the family members of private personnel who participate in production equally. For example, Yu Kunyu's wife, a member of the Democratic National Construction Association, overfulfilled her task in the Mingya Machinery Factory, but she was not praised. Someone suggested that the public representative said: "We must stand firm, it is better not to praise her."

He believes that there is indeed a wall and a ditch between Party members and non-Party members, and now is the time to demolish the wall and fill the ditch. He suggested: 1. In the future, personnel should be employed according to the standards of both ability and integrity, regardless of party affiliation or class background, and they should be boldly used. The same requirements should be put forward for Party and non-Party cadres, and those who are not competent should be replaced. 2. The Party and the government should not be separated, and the Party should not replace the government. 3. In joint ventures, a public-private co-work system should be established to trust and support private personnel. 4. Clear methods should be established for the issues of small and medium-sized households giving up fixed interest and joining the trade union, as well as issues such as wage and welfare benefits, seniority, sick leave wages, and capital agents, so that everyone can get what they deserve and mobilize all positive factors. 5. Education on the united front policy inside and outside the Party should be strengthened, the role of democratic parties should be publicized, and Party members and non-Party members should make friends. 6. Some systems, such as the confidentiality system and the meeting system, should be changed accordingly according to the new situation. He very much agrees with the opinion of the Anhui Provincial Party Committee in the rectification plan that when government agencies, organizations, and enterprises discuss policies and guidelines, relevant personnel from democratic parties should be invited to participate.

Xiang De believes:

As long as the fixed interest exists, class relations exist, and no method can hide it

Xiang De, Director of the Hunan Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce, first introduced what the industrialists and businessmen in Hunan have been discussing recently and what reasons are hindering the display of the enthusiasm of the industry and commerce community.

The main reason hindering the enthusiasm of industrialists and businessmen is the Party's sectarianism.

He said that the main reason hindering the enthusiasm of industrialists and businessmen is the Party's sectarianism. It is manifested in the promotion of cadres, Party members who do not understand the business are promoted quickly, while non-Party cadres cannot be promoted; Party members have privileged thinking, do not abide by the system, the evaluation of awards is unfair, they are unwilling to accept criticism, Party members who make mistakes are not publicly punished; Party members do not trust others, do not consult with non-Party members when encountering things, and do not value the progress of non-Party members; Party members and non-Party members do not interact with each other, speak according to the person, and treat them differently, and so on. He said: The reason why these shortcomings occur is often inseparable from the shortcomings of the leading party and government organs at the higher level. For example, in January this year, the Xiangtan Municipal People's Committee convened a meeting of financial and economic cadres above the deputy level to deploy the work for the first quarter. The public side of the Handicraft Cooperative Federation marked on the notice that the private deputy director should attend, but after the private deputy director arrived at the venue, someone asked him to withdraw from the venue. In the relationship between public and private co-work, class relations are emphasized, private parties are not trusted and supported, so that private parties have positions but no power. For example, some small business owners have difficult lives, especially when the private party in joint ventures dies, the family members have no means of support, and this has not been resolved. There are no regulations for sick leave wages. Some people have asked to have their hats removed, but this has not been taken seriously.

Speaking of the contradictions in the industry and commerce community, he said: I think the contradictions in the industry and commerce community are the same as the general contradictions among the people, but they also have their unique contradictions, that is, class contradictions. This contradiction is mainly manifested in the relationship between public and private co-work and the fixed interest issue.

First, the contradiction between public and private relations has been concentrated on the question of whether public representatives are needed.

As long as the fixed interest exists, the private party exists; as long as the private party exists, the enterprise is a joint venture.

Some people say: The current joint public-private enterprises are actually no longer joint public-private enterprises. Because the rights of person, property, and operation no longer belong to the private party, the profits and losses are not related to the private party, and there is only a little fixed interest. To call it a joint public-private venture again is dogmatism.

My opinion is different. I think that although the three rights of the private party are gone, and the size of the enterprise's profit is also less related to the private party, this is only a change in the quantity of the private, not a change in the quality. As long as there is a little "private" quantity existing, there is still a "private" quality existing, and it cannot be said that it is not a joint public-private venture. What is this little "private"? It is the fixed interest obtained by the private party. The fixed interest is based on the fixed shares of the private party in the enterprise's means of production. If it is said that there is fixed interest but no private party, then who is taking the fixed interest? Since there is a private party, and it is said that it is not a joint public-private venture, then who is cooperating with whom?

As long as the fixed interest exists, classes exist; whoever takes the fixed interest is a bourgeois element.

Some people say that the private party has handed over the enterprise and has no means of exploitation, so there is no class relationship and no need for transformation.

I think it cannot be said that way. First of all, it is necessary to clarify that the existence of a class is conditional. What is the condition? That is, the bourgeoisie still takes fixed interest. Fixed interest is an income of an exploitative nature. Therefore, as long as fixed interest exists, classes exist. From the perspective of specific people, whoever has exploitative income is a bourgeois element, even if his job position is not in the original enterprise, or even in a joint venture, but in a state-owned enterprise, in an administrative-natured bureau, or in a government-natured people's committee. In a word, whether a class exists or not, whether someone is a bourgeois element or not, cannot be divided by whether it is a joint public-private venture or whether they work in a joint public-private enterprise, but by whether or not there is exploitative income, and how much. It is impossible to convince people if this point is not recognized.

Giving up the fixed interest, the joint venture becomes a state-owned enterprise, and ideological transformation is still needed.

Secondly, regarding the issue of transformation, especially ideological transformation. The ideological transformation of bourgeois elements is to change capitalist ideas and establish socialist ideas. Ideological issues cannot be measured by changes in class structure, foundation, and work. Even if the fixed interest is given up, there is no exploitation, and the joint venture becomes a state-owned enterprise, ideological transformation is still needed. Therefore, I believe that the ideological transformation of the bourgeoisie is a thorough and long-term task. "Long live" the democratic parties and the Federation of Industry and Commerce is because there is this transformation task. To say "long live" is not to flatter you, to make you happy, nor is it to win you over insincerely, but to make higher demands and greater tasks of you. That is to say, the road ahead is still long, don't be in a hurry to get off the horse, and continue to work hard. That is to say, the cause of socialism and communism is a common cause, and everyone is required to be jointly responsible and take long-term responsibility to continue doing it.

Since it is a joint venture, there must be public representatives; to solve all the contradictions in the enterprise, a democratic management committee must be established.

Some people say that in order to give play to the enthusiasm of private personnel and make the enterprise better, the public representatives should be withdrawn.

I also disagree with this opinion. Since the enterprise is a joint public-private venture, there must be public representatives (but attention must be paid to giving play to the enthusiasm of the private party to make the enterprise better). Joint ventures not only have the public party and the private party, but also workers. Withdrawing the public representatives will not only resolve the public-private contradiction, but it cannot solve the contradiction between the leadership and the workers. Therefore, from the perspective of joint ventures, I think a management committee should be established as a leading organization. Its members include representatives sent by the government, that is, the current public party, workers, cadres, and the private party. The director or chairman is appointed by the public representative because he represents public ownership, that is, the interests of all the people. The committee has a set of systems, and operates according to the system. Some people say, will this weaken the leadership of the Party and the public representatives? Will it relax the transformation of the private party? I don't think so. On the contrary, it will strengthen it.

Leadership is not "I have the final say"; true leadership is to mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses and implement the policies of the state and the Party.

There are three views on leadership: one says that so-called leadership is to manage everything, and it does not count unless I nod; another says that whoever proposes an opinion and view on a certain matter is monopolizing, is a leadership indication, is a real idea and a false discussion (of course, this is indeed the case); one says that consulting with the masses about things, accepting other people's opinions, and changing one's own opinions is giving up leadership. This is to view the issue of leadership from the perspective of pragmatism, dogmatism, and sectarianism.

I believe that true leadership is to promote democracy, mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses, implement the policies of the Party and the state, and complete the plan. Therefore, leadership is not only not afraid of the masses, but on the contrary, it must look for the masses. The democratic management committee is the best organization to overcome bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism. The thinking of private personnel can only be transformed well through the collective leadership of the democratic management committee, division of labor and responsibility, and the specific work with positions, powers, and responsibilities, and repeated exercises through criticism and self-criticism and a number of experiences and lessons.

Some people are embarrassed to take fixed interest in front of the exploited, so they came up with a plan to escape, suggesting that the fixed interest be turned into a certificate of

    怎样认识公私关系和赎买政策？
    工商界人士发表各种不同意见
    本报讯　中共中央统战部召开的工商界座谈会于昨日（25日）举行第九次座谈。麻新泉、黄祖康、黄炎培、温少鹤、徐崇林、向德、吴家荪、孙孚凌等八人在会上发了言。另外还有王达夫、李忠义、陈炳煌三人提出了书面意见。黄炎培发言：
    帮助共产党种牛痘
    中国民主建国会主任委员黄炎培说：我们才从上海、无锡、南京视察归来，正在“百家争鸣”的时候，我也应该“鸣”一下，可是我的“鸣”，主要是“鸣人之所鸣”。
      “鸣”是和党内整风运动结合起来的。我向中共中央统战部和国务院第八办公室提出意见以前，先说一下我对整风运动的看法。
    我在1945年从重庆到延安，见了毛泽东主席，临走的时候，他曾经向我征求对延安所见所闻的意见。我答：现在很好，我想，“很好”之上又加个“现在”，对方应该有所刺激的。因为我所亲眼看到的，任何事业，初办时吃尽艰难困苦，从万死中求得一生，后来环境好转了，骄傲了，懒惰了，不团结了，最后是失败了消灭了。我希望找出一条新路，跳出这周期性的支配。毛主席答：我们已经找到了一条新路，就是民主。只有让人民来监督政府，人人起来负责，才不致于像你所说的演变。这次党内整风运动，这样做法，我到几处地方接触一下，感觉真是必要。我们小组从南京回来，恰好在车上碰到盛丕华同志。闲谈中间，他说：“党的整风，等于种牛痘”。这句话妙极了，越想越有道理。我们年轻的都种过牛痘，年老的也许种过土痘。我的手为什么曲而不伸呢，就因为土痘的毒没有很好发泄。我尝过不种牛痘的苦！一个人生下来应该及时种牛痘。帮助党整风，等于帮助亲爱的人种牛痘，有痘毒在内而不种，结果一定是浑身满面“天花乱坠”。这几年来，我对党的政策、方针是完全拥护的。但在执行过程中所发生的一些偏差，我是常常毫不客气地以“诤友”自居，来对党提意见。这次我到上海、无锡、南京三个地方视察，深切体会到党和政府在工作中所取得的巨大成就，无论如何要承认。但是，同时也发现了不少缺点和毛病。现在且就我们工商界同志所最关心的两个问题，拿出来说一说。
    公私关系搞得好，生产一定搞得好，公私关系搞不好，很难希望生产搞好。
    第一、我们工商界同志目前最关心的，就是怎样搞好“公私共事关系”的问题。
    就目前的“公私共事关系”来说，一般还是正常的。我们这次视察，采用开矿下钻的办法，在上海看了四个厂，在南京看了一个厂。其中有些工厂搞得特别好。例如我们在上海曾经参观过有代表性的震旦铁工厂、上海机床标准零件厂、美光织造厂和华成电气厂。这四个厂的公私关系都比较好。因此，在生产上也都有较好的成绩。在南京，我们也曾经去参观过一个大同被单厂。这个厂在南京的公私合营企业中，就“公私共事关系”来说，可以认为比较突出地良好。由于“公”“私”关系好，生产水平因此也很迅速地提高。1956年总产值比1955年增长了44.9％。质量也有显著的进步。就我们所知，大同被单厂搞好“公私共事关系”的方法，有这么几点：一、公、私双方的职责划分得很清楚，私方有了一定的职责，就可以主动地发挥积极性；二、重视对私方人员的教育工作，同时也重视对党员对职工干部进行统战政策与赎买政策的教育；三、能充分发挥民建支部和民建会员的作用，组织私方人员参加社会主义劳动竞赛，真正做到以企业为基地来对私方人员进行改造。
    这三种办法，别的工厂当然也是可以做到的。有些工厂搞得不好，因为所采取的办法和上述方法相反。例如一、分工不明确，私方人员没有一定的职责权限，对私方人员采取歧视的态度；二、只片面地对私方人员进行教育，而对党内干部或职员群众很少进行教育，管了一面，丢了另一面，双方的关系因此就搞不好；三、不重视发挥民建的组织作用，不懂得在私方人员中培养骨干分子带头接受社会主义改造的重要性。而在这三种缺点中，最严重的乃是第一点，即对私方采取歧视的办法。
    我在这上边看出一条似乎可以认为规律的，就是在企业中间，凡公私关系搞得好的，如没有特种因素，生产一定搞得好；而相反地，如公私关系搞不好，很难希望生产搞好。
    必须纠正公方对私方的歧视；人事问题民主党派要共同负责。
    我在这次视察中，发现不少合营企业是对私方人员存在着歧视的。其中有些歧视的办法甚至到了荒谬的程度。例如在南京就有一个厂，今年清明去祭扫烈士墓的时候，到了祭扫完毕，工会的负责人要报告烈士的生平事迹的时候，就要求私方人员走开，因此引起了私方人员很大的反感。无锡有一个协新毛织厂，今年春节，私方正厂长值班，到车间去巡查，厂内保卫科长竟然要求厂长拿出工作证才许进车间，而对公方副厂长就没有提这种要求。可见这个厂保卫科的工作人员对于私方的歧视已经到了何等严重的程度。这样的事情，我也碰到过。我在轻工业部工作五年，关系搞得很好。当部长总想做些部长的事，我管八九十个厂，我想把局长、厂长的名单抄一份在办公室挂出来。秘书说，党总支不同意。后来，有两位青年党员同志说不能挂，要保密。我说政务院还要公布名单呢，这有什么保密。不久，我在一位党员司长办公室看见一个名单清清楚楚挂出来了。经过说明工作需要，我的办公室里才挂上了局、厂长的名单。当然，他们都很年轻，他们都尽忠于党，很难责怪他们，因为教育不够，所以思想偏到一方面去了。另外，对于人事制度也是如此。目前有好多公私合营厂的私方人员，不论是正厂长也好，副厂长也好，差不多对于厂内的人事任用，都完全不能过问。这就大大地使合营厂的人事任用、干部考核带着片面性，这是很不好的。一般私方人员不敢说话，怕打击报复，原因就为人事大权由党方单独掌握，如果得罪了党，隔了一时，掌握人事的只须轻轻地把你一调，调到你所万不愿意的职位上，使你一点没得办法。去年，我接到一封人民来信，要求调动工作。信写得文理通顺，我把他的信转到江苏省教育厅，该厅不加思索层层下转，结果，他所在的单位竟因此把他调去扫地。（现在这个问题已经解决了，他已经到农村当教员去了。）——以上这些对私方人员所采取的歧视办法，党和政府必须迅速有效地加以纠正。我建议这些人事机构可以由党、行政、工会、民主党派合组委员会来共同负责。我从报纸上看到李维汉部长主张对工商联内部人事问题不应由党包办。这是非常好的主张，可以推广开去。
    提前考虑给中下层“摘帽子”。
    第二、眼前我们值得大大关心的又一问题，是工商界中下层的生活福利问题。我们必须承认：目前有些工商界同志们的生活的确是很困难的。他们顶了一个“资本家”的帽子，可是生活却相当艰苦。有些人的定息少到只有几元钱、几角钱，可是他们却因此就不能享受“劳保”。他们虽然也愿意积极参加劳动竞赛，可是由于有顾虑，还怕一旦病倒的时候，反而要减扣工资，所以总不能充分发挥积极性。我认为，对于这些已经在实质上是依靠工资劳动维持生活，而同时在工作上又有积极表现，在思想上已有显著转变的“私方人员”，政府应当提前考虑他们的“摘帽子”问题。这点愿向政府郑重建议。
    早就决定的病假工资办法迟迟不公布，充分表现了“八办”的官僚主义作风。
    至于私方人员的病假工资问题，就我所知，贾拓夫同志老早在今年3月间对工商界同志作了决定。可是我这次在上海、无锡、南京，特别是在南京视察时，已是5月中旬的末了，工商界同志们却普遍地还在为这个早已解决了的问题苦恼。我们查问的结果，才知道贾拓夫同志虽然早作了决定，可是国务院第八办公室却并没有趁早把这个决定用公文下达，也没有把这个决定在报纸上公布，以致引起了工商界的普遍混乱。希望以后各部门的所有和人民生活有关的命令、通知，最好全文在报上公布。最近人民日报上登载的卫生部提倡避孕的通知，仅仅作了摘要发表，我们就没有机会看到全文，如果能全文刊登就好了。在这一问题上，我认为国务院第八办公室实在是充分地表现出不关心工商界人士的疾苦，高高在上，十足官僚主义的作风。我认为今后党和政府实在有改变这种作风，切实注意关心工商界中下层生活的必要。
    根据以上种种，我们可以看出，在目前私营工商业社会主义改造过程中，还充满着问题。由于这些问题还没有能够完全得到解决，所以在如何使工商界进一步发挥积极性、贡献自己的才能这一点上，就或多或少地受到了阻碍。就我所知，眼前绝大部分工商界人士要求进步都是很迫切的。如果党和政府能够在这次整风运动中切实地改进了所有工作上的缺点，克服了它的官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义，那么，我相信工商界同志们的积极性一定还能够得到更大的发挥！
    但我们必须明白：我们所以要这样做，正是像我们在开头所说的那样，是为了给共产党种“牛痘”。种牛痘这一个譬方，是很正确的。如果它身体中间没有毒素，种下去的牛痘不会出的。这还不是毛主席说的“有则改之，无则加勉”么！我们的目的是积极的，是为了要能够更好地让党领导我们大家早日把我们的祖国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家。
    我个人相信：眼前虽然有很多党员在作风上有官僚主义、组织上有宗派主义、思想上有主观主义的毛病，但从整个党的方针、路线、政策来说，是完全正确的。就看这一次整风运动吧！这样广泛地让大家“鸣”“放”，同志们！不问古今中外，还能找出那个空间，那个时间，像中国共产党毛泽东主席在今天的中国，不但允许大家“鸣”“放”，而且要求大家“鸣”啊！“放”啊！就这一点来说，不能不认为伟大吧！我很反对某些人看法：说人家好，简直有百是而无一非；到翻过来的时候，又是有百非而无一是。
    中国的私营工商业能够接受社会主义改造这一点，是中国共产党的伟大贡献，是马克思主义在中国的新的发展。我们工商界同志们在这次伟大的党的整风运动中，完全没有理由在帮助党进行整风的同时，放松对于自己的改造。
    我还要谈种牛痘。牛痘是人人要种的，没有例外的。而且隔了一年二年还要种，直要种到没有反应，就是“无则加勉”为止。我想从婴儿长大起来的人，没有不懂的吧！怎么党员被整风，我们不要自我改造呢！相反地正因为我们要帮助党整风，克服官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义，我们就更应该虚心地向党的整风运动的精神学习，认识我们自己的阶级本质所带来的局限性，进一步地在“破资本主义、立社会主义”的方向上努力。
    我们民建会过去在代表工商界的合法利益上，以及帮助党进行资本主义工商业的改造问题上，都没有把工作做得十分足够，这些我们要坦白的。今后，我们必须好好地努力，在这一点上，也希望中央统战部不要放松领导。我们民建会如果在思想上、在组织上有错误，党还是应该“当仁不让”地纠正我们的缺点和错误。如果实行“互相监督”，我们在批评党了，我监督你，为什么你不监督我呢？我认为：只有这样做，才能叫做真正的“长期共存”“互相监督”。
    同志们！牛痘人人要种的。共产党在种牛痘了。千万莫忘记自己种牛痘。麻新泉认为：
    资产阶级交出企业，外因起主导作用
    黑龙江省工商联秘书长麻新泉就民族资产阶级到底有没有两面性的问题发表了意见。他说：有人认为不要再提两面性和阶级关系了，也不要再划什么阶级界限了，他们认为民族资产阶级的立场观点和工人阶级只有共同之处，没有差异之分，因而也就没有什么求同存异的问题了，认为民族资产阶级同是国家主人，可以和工人阶级共分天下，平分秋色，并驾齐驱了。我不同意这种说法，我认为这种说法，实质上就是不需要工人阶级领导，这对工商界的进步是危险的。还有的人以交出了企业作为资本，来向党讨价还价，夸耀于人。当然资产阶级能交出企业是一种进步的表现，但不能因此就骄傲起来。民族资产阶级并非天生就是社会主义者，而是由于国内国际的影响和政府一系列的安排改造措施，在社会上造成大势所趋人心所向，才把企业交出来的。我认为是外因起了主导作用。有人说“甘心情愿”把企业交出来，倒不如说“不太勉强”更为确切。
    他认为资产阶级还有两面性，只不过在全行业合营之后，资产阶级的进步一面成为主要方面，而消极方面也与以前有所不同罢了。不承认这一点是不行的。现在有些人不是全心全意为社会主义服务，而是三心二意，甚至对社会主义还有抵触情绪。有人认为企业不是自己的了，就产生了松劲情绪。有的说：“厂长厂长，床上一躺，半月借薪，月末开饷”。有些人认为合营后有三不自由：一，花钱不自由；二，按时上下班，人身不自由；三，经营不自由。还有些人盗卖物资，造假账、开假发票，私收账款等等。尽管这些人是少数，但毕竟是出在我们工商界，又和我们的阶级本质相联系，因此，认为和工人阶级没有差异之分也是错误的。
    李部长提出工商联党员副秘书长要不要的问题，我的意见是要，不能撤走，若撤走对工作不利。在不少市县中，党员秘书长或秘书是存在一些问题的。如对主委的职权尊重不够，有些包办代替的现象。有的市工商联党员秘书长单独作主行事，像要在市联会员代表大会上聘请几位工商界兼职的副秘书长，这样有关人事的重要问题，事前不和主委协商，直到他在大会主席团的准备会上提出名单时，主副委们才知道。也有的县工商联党员秘书长，开工商业者会议，事前不通过主委，到开会时写个报告材料，临时叫主委念一下，结果主委不愿意当传话筒，就没给念。这种包办代替的作风，在少数市县工商联中还存在着。我认为党员秘书长应当很好地按照工商业联合会的章程规定，在正副主任委员的领导下处理会务，尊重主副委的职权，并且认真地发挥委员会的集体领导作用。应该承认，非党秘书长有他不可代替的作用，党员秘书长也有非党秘书长所不可代替的作用。所以党员秘书长撤不得。黄祖康说：
    并厂并店，要考虑华侨投资的特点
    上海前先施公司副经理、民建委员黄祖康说，我是一个归国华侨。华侨历来就是热爱祖国的，由于过去在国外受到帝国主义的压迫，把在艰苦工作中所挣来的钱，汇回来办实业或买房子，希望能够早一天回到祖国安居乐业。因此，每年的侨汇一直是很可观的，最近上海成立一个华侨投资公司，虽然时间不久，但汇回来的侨汇数已经不少，对祖国的建设有一定贡献。
    这是一件好事。但是我们一方面争取华侨投资，另一方面在合营后，又把解放前华侨投资的企业并掉了，这对争取华侨投资是不利的。我举两个例子说明：一个例子：上海南京路有一家中国内衣公司，是二十多年前华侨投资的，合营后，有关领导公司把这家公司并到北站区，连牌号也去掉了。这个公司有两个经理，一个在檀香山，一个在上海。如果在上海的经理将这件事情告诉国外的经理，那末就可能引起华侨对于向国内投资的顾虑。
    另一个例子：有三十多年历史的先施牙膏厂，共有三个厂，一个在香港，一个在广州，一个在上海，产品远销南洋、新加坡等地。但在合营以后，把先施牙膏厂并掉了，厂名也取消了，先施牙膏也不生产了。
    他说，我并不反对并厂并店，只是希望在合并的时候，要考虑到华侨的观感，不要引起他们对投资的顾虑。我建议政府很好地考虑这个问题，照顾华侨投资的特点。徐崇林说：
    非党人士有职无权是普遍现象
    民主建国会重庆市委员会主任委员徐崇林说：在机关、企业、学校中，非党人士有职无权现象相当普遍。我是重庆市人民委员会委员，由于不了解全面情况，开会时很难发言。每次开会半天，讨论问题很多，这些会实际上是走过场。有些事情，做完了才在会上追认。有时党员委员不来开会，因为会上要讨论的问题党组早决定了，不来也没关系。我当公用局局长，要人事科汇报肃反情况，他们不汇报。我召开过一次关于缆车安全问题的会议，决定了一些安全措施，至今也未办。要是我是党员，可能就办了。我认为，从“设计”到“施工”，从“编导”到“彩排”，民主党派都应参加，这样非党人士才能搞好工作。周总理在重庆作报告，资本家的人民委员就听不到。重庆公用局党员干部有宗派主义，有特权思想，提拔升级都是党员占先，非党干部很难得到提拔。公用局非党干部冯克熙，水平高，有能力，干了好几年还是个计划科长。我是市城市建设委员会的委员，正副主任是党员。这个委员会从未开过会，我提了几次意见也不开，可见对非党干部的意见不重视。
    他说：非党人士有职无权的现象，跟党政不分、以党代政、以及很多党员思想落后于形势的发展，看不到党外人士的进步是分不开的。党政不分，从中央到地方都有。我怀疑中共中央和国务院联合发指示是否恰当。重庆市有些工作也是党政联合发指示。这种以党代政的做法，会给人以错觉，好像行政单独发的指示，就不是重要的工作。
    他批评重庆市统战部对民建会干部的配备、支持、协助不够。他还认为统战部统上不统下，统男不统女，接触面狭，了解情况不全面，对人的安排有时就不够妥当，有时反映问题犹如石沉大海，没有下文。
    他说，重庆市合营企业中私方人员有职无权的现象也很严重。公方代表对私方人员是“信任不足，支持不力，使用不当，关怀不够，分工不明；私方人员关不倒火（即做不了主），公方人员点头作数。”他说绝大部分私方人员是愿意继续接受改造和参加增产节约运动的，但有的人提出的合理化建议得不到支持，有的人不能参加上级召开的会议，看不到与自己业务有关的文件。有的公方代表和支部书记管的事太多，使私方人员无事可做，在群众中毫无威信。有的公方代表、党员干部的宗派主义、官僚主义严重；民主作风差，协商时，真主意，假商量，摆出一副改造者的面孔，使人望而生畏；作风粗暴，过分强调阶级关系，偏听偏信；对私方人员缺点错误过分挑剔，但自己有错误不检讨。公方代表对私方人员家属参加生产，没有一视同仁。如民建会会员于坤裕的爱人在明亚机器厂超额完成任务，没受到表扬，有人提意见，公方代表说：“要站稳立场，还是不表扬好。”
    他认为党与非党人员之间确实有墙有沟，现在是拆墙填沟的时候了。他建议：一、今后用人要根据德才的标准，不分党派、阶级成分，大胆使用，对党与非党干部提出同样要求，不称职的都要撤换。二、不要党政不分，不要以党代政。三、在合营企业中，订出公私共事制度，信任和支持私方人员。四、对中、小户放弃定息、加入工会问题，以及工资福利待遇问题、工龄问题、病假工资问题、资方代理人问题等，都要有明确的办法，才能各得其所，调动一切积极因素。五、要加强党内外的统战政策教育，宣传民主党派的作用，党员与非党员要交朋友。六、有些制度，如保密制度、会议制度等，要根据新形势作相应改变。他很同意安徽省委在整风计划中规定的机关、团体、企业讨论政策方针的时候，请民主党派有关人员参加的意见。向德认为：
    定息存在，阶级关系就存在，用任何方法也掩盖不了
    湖南省工商联主任委员向德在发言中首先介绍了湖南工商业者最近讨论什么事情什么原因阻碍了工商界的积极性的发挥的问题。
    阻碍工商业者发挥积极性的主要原因是党的宗派主义。
    他说，阻碍工商业者发挥积极性的主要原因是党的宗派主义。它表现在提拔干部上，党员不懂业务也提拔得很快，而非党干部却得不到提升；党员有特权思想，不遵守制度，评奖不公，不愿接受批评，党员犯了错误，不公开处分；党员对别人不信任，遇事不同非党员商量，不重视非党员进步；党员与非党员互不往来，看人说话，分别对待，等等。他说：这些缺点所以发生，往往跟上级党政领导机关的缺点是分不开的。比如今年1月湘潭市人民委员会召集副职以上财经干部会议，布置一季度工作的时候，手工联社公方在通知上批明要私方副主任去参加，可是私方副主任到会场以后，有人就要他退出会场。在公私共事关系上，强调阶级关系，不信任和支持私方，以致私方有职无权。又如有些小企业主生活困难，特别是在合营企业中的私方死后，家属生活无着，也没有得到解决。病假工资没有规定。有人要求摘掉帽子也没有被重视。
    讲到工商界中的矛盾问题的时候，他说：我认为工商界中的矛盾跟一般人民内部的矛盾一样，但又有它独特的矛盾，即阶级矛盾。这一矛盾主要表现在公私共事关系上和定息问题上。
    第一，公私关系的矛盾，已集中表现在要不要公方代表的问题上。
    定息存在，私方就存在；私方存在，企业就是合营性质的。
    有人说：现在的公私合营企业，实际上已经不是公私合营企业了。因为人权、财权、经营权已不属私方，盈亏与私方无关，只有一点定息，再把它叫做公私合营，就是教条主义。
    我的看法不同。我认为虽然私方的三权没有了，企业利润的大小同私方的关系也少了，但这只是私的量的变化，还不是质的变化，只要有一点“私”的量存在，就仍有“私”的质存在，就不能说不是公私合营了。这一点“私”是什么呢？就是私方所得的定息。定息是根据私方在企业生产资料的定股来的。如果说有定息而没有私方，那末定息又是谁拿去了呢？既有私方又说不是公私合营，那末是谁同谁合营呢？
    定息存在，阶级就存在；谁拿定息，谁就是资产阶级分子。
    有人说，私方交出了企业，没有剥削工具了，因而也就没有阶级关系存在，也不需要改造了。
    我认为不能这样说。首先，要弄清阶级的存在是有条件的。条件是什么？就是资产阶级还拿定息，定息是剥削性质的收入，因此，有定息存在就有阶级存在。从具体的人来说，谁有剥削收入，谁就是资产阶级分子，那怕他的工作岗位不在原企业，甚至不在合营企业，而在国营企业，在行政性质的局，在政权性质的人民委员会。一句话，阶级存不存在，谁是不是资产阶级分子，不能以是不是公私合营，是不是在公私合营企业中工作来划分，而是以剥削收入的有无和多少来划分，不承认这一点就不能说服人。
    放弃了定息，合营企业变成了国营企业，思想还需要改造。
    其次，关于改造问题，特别是思想改造问题。资产阶级分子的思想改造，就是改掉资本主义思想，树立社会主义思想。思想问题，不能以阶级结构、基础及工作的变化来衡量。即使放弃了定息，没有了剥削，合营企业变成了国营企业，思想改造还是需要的。因此，我认为资产阶级的思想改造，是脱胎换骨的、长期的工作。民主党派、工商联“万岁”，就是因为有这一个改造任务。提“万岁”，不是奉承你，使你开心，也不是笼络你的假心肠，而是向你提出更高的要求和更大任务。就是说，前面的路还长着啦，不要急于下马，还要加油干。就是说，社会主义共产主义的事业是共同的事业，要求大家共同负责，长期负责干下去。
    既是合营性质，就要有公方代表；要解决企业里所有的矛盾，还要成立民主管理委员会。
    有人说，要发挥私方人员的积极性，把企业搞得更好，就要撤出公方代表。
    我也不同意这个意见。企业既然是公私合营性质，就要有公方代表（但必须注意要发挥私方的积极性，使企业搞得好）。合营企业不仅有公方，有私方，还有工人，撤出了公方代表，即使解决了公私矛盾，但是还不能解决领导和工人的矛盾。所以，从合营企业要求来看，我认为要成立一个管理委员会作为领导机构。它的成员有政府派来的代表，即现在的公方，有工人，有干部和私方。主任或主席由公方代表当，因为他是代表公有制的，即代表全民利益的。委员会有一套制度，照制度办事。有人说这样会不会削弱党和公方代表的领导呢？会不会放松对私方的改造呢？我看都不会的，相反的会加强。
    领导，不是“我说了算”；真正的领导是发动群众的积极性，贯彻国家和党的政策。
    对领导问题，有三种看法：一说，所谓领导就是事事都管，而且非我点头就不算；一说，谁对某一件事提出一个意见和看法，即是包办，即是领导示意，即是真主意假商量（当然也确有如此的）；一说，有事和群众商量，接受了别人的意见，改变了自己的意见，就是放弃领导。这是从事务主义、教条主义、宗派主义的观点来看领导问题。
    我以为，真正的领导，就是发扬民主，发动群众的积极性，贯彻党和国家的政策和完成计划。所以，领导不仅不怕群众，相反的要找群众。民主管理委员会正是克服官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义的最好的组织。私方人员的思想，只有通过民主管理委员会的集体领导，分工负责，通过有职有权有责的具体工作，经过批评和自我批评和若干经验教训的反复锻炼，才能改造好。
    有人不好意思在被剥削者面前拿定息，就想出了金蝉脱壳之计，建议把定息变成存单或公债。
    第二，李康年提出定息二十年，还有人提出发赎买存单或公债券，由银行发款。长沙工商界讨论了这个问题，有的同意二十年，多数不同意，但绝大多数认为用存单方式由银行发款为好。
    我的看法恰好相反，李康年提出要定息二十年，他有自由，但不能用存单方式或公债方式，也不能由银行付款。为什么？我认为：大家都承认赎买政策是对的，但每每在口头上承诺了，转一个弯又想不承认了。
    赎买就是承认生产资料、资本，实际是工人阶级的，工人阶级不愿强行拿回去，而愿意出钱给我们，所以叫赎买。
    工人阶级的东西为什么到了我们手里呢？是我们剥削来的。剥削是不光荣的，可耻的。这点大家同意，但是有些人可能说定息不是剥削，湖南就有人这样说。这种说法当然站不住。人家只要问一句话：“定息既不是劳动收入，那么，不是剥削又是什么呢？”回答不出。有些人不好意思在被剥削者面前去拿定息，于是就想变一变，穿上另一件外衣，如存单、公债等等，像其他存款的人一样到银行去拿。
    私方人员的病假工资比工人的还高；工商界是否想到这个规定也是赎买政策呢？
    李康年提出定息二十年，他有这个自由。国家现在还没有法律说定息几年，那就可长可短，各人可有发表意见、提出要求的自由。我看这是各人对赎买政策的看法和觉悟不同的问题。何以说对赎买问题看法还各有不同呢？可以举例说明：私方人员的病假工资，国务院规定按困难情况、病假长短，定为50％到70％，不管非会员，不管工龄。这件事在长沙就伤了脑筋。叫私方病假工资少，是我们；现在说伤脑筋也是我们。问题在哪里？问题在于，长沙工人实行劳保条例的有四万多人。病假工资，是会员的六月以内领60％到100％，六月以上领40％到60％，都要算工龄，非会员对折。只实行劳保合同的有五万多人是会员的，病假工资为40％到80％，不算工龄，非会员对折。此外还有无劳保合同的约二万人。以实行劳保合同的工人中的非会员来讲，病假工资只有20％到40％。就是说，最高只有40％，抵不上私方的最低数50％。实行劳保条例的非会员，只有30％到50％，最高数等于私方最低数。难道非会员的工人还抵不上资本家?？同在一个厂工作，彼此相处，待遇不同，请问如何处得下去？市人委和统战部、工会和我们商量，国务院这个规定不执行是不行的；要执行，又要看到这样做会使阶级关系更不好，工人对私方人员的观感更不好，从资产阶级着想，政治上是很不利的。我们商量好久，结果只有一条赎买政策大道理来向工人说服。难道除了这一条，还可以说出其他理由?？在私方人员是不是想到病假工资这个规定也是赎买政策呢？打不打收条呢？假如这个座谈会里还有工人，就不能只由我们讲话。难道他们就不怕病了无人理?？当然也可以说：“他们的病假工资也加上好了”，问题在于企业支持不了。现在还有不少企业连劳保合同都不能执行，如长沙建中织布厂，会员连30％病假工资也没有。所以说，要统筹兼顾，适当安排。不然矛盾会更加尖锐。
    又要拿定息，又说“阶级关系不存在，你莫喊我做私方”，这不能服人。
    末了，对定息问题，我不反对别人要二十年；但要求别人不反对其他的人不要；要求政府大公无私，一视同仁，要的就发，要放弃的就接受。这样，大中户就各得其所了。如果要了，又说“阶级关系不存在，你莫喊我做私方，不能以阶级成份看人”，那是不足以服人的。这里我还要说明两点：一、定息是剥削性质的，因此它是阶级关系和鉴别谁是资产阶级分子的标志；二、定息是根据企业资金定股来的，因此，要列作企业经济核算的支出，要在企业里发，不能作存单，不是公债，不能由银行付款，那样做会模糊事实和是非。
    以上两个问题实际上是一个问题，一个根子。就是说，定息是根据私营工商业者在企业的资本来核算息金的，因此，它既是剥削，又不能和金蝉脱壳一样脱离开企业。也因此，还是有私方的存在，有公方的必要；有阶级存在，有改造的必要。但全行业公私合营实行定息制度后，与过去的公私合营不同了。在新情况下要有新的观点，新的方法，才能把企业搞得更好。
