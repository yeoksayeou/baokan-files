    Conscientiously Receive People's Visits, Ease Internal Contradictions
    The General Office of the CCP Central Committee and the General Office of the State Council Convene Cadres of Relevant Departments to Study This Issue
    (Our Newspaper) News: On the afternoon of the 11th, the General Office of the CCP Central Committee and the General Office of the State Council convened cadres from central-level Party and government organs, mass organizations, and relevant organs in Beijing to jointly study and resolve problems existing in the work of receiving people's visits. At the meeting, Yang Shangkun, Director of the General Office of the CCP Central Committee, and Xi Zhongxun, Secretary-General of the State Council, successively gave reports on the current status of the work of receiving people's visits by central-level organs, the problems that exist, and the solutions to the problems. The meeting also announced the "Scope of Receiving People's Visits (Draft)" by the Central Ministry of Internal Affairs and nineteen other departments, and "Provisional Measures for Several Specific Issues in Handling People's Visits."
    Prior to this meeting, the General Office of the CCP Central Committee and the General Office of the State Council heard from various central-level organs that many problems urgently needed to be resolved in the work of receiving visitors in the recent period, and had conducted investigations with their respective subordinate units and relevant units at the Beijing municipal level.
    According to the investigation, more than fifty central-level organs currently have the task of receiving people's visits. There are about three hundred cadres doing this work, and they are generally diligent, conscientious, and responsible in their work. At least half of the issues they deal with are resolved relatively completely and in a timely manner. However, with the development of the situation, some new situations and problems have also emerged. This is prominently manifested in the following aspects: First, the number of visitors has greatly increased. Taking the Ministry of Internal Affairs and twenty other units as an example, the number of visitors received in 1956 was 42,000, and this increased to 22,400 in the first quarter of this year. This includes multiple cases of collective visits, which were relatively rare in the past. And these phenomena are expected to increase in the future. Second, judging from the demands raised by the visitors, according to statistics from the General Office of the CCP Central Committee, the most common are requests for assistance in resolving employment and livelihood difficulties, accounting for about 55% to 60% of the total, and most other issues are also related to occupation and livelihood. Only less than 5% of the people are troublemakers or mentally ill. Furthermore, judging from the specific issues raised by the visiting masses, a large part of them reflect the contradictions between the work style, system, and institutions of Party and government organs and cadres, and the demands of the people. This is an important sign of the reduction of domestic class struggle and the prominence of internal contradictions among the people. However, the leaders of many organs and many comrades who directly receive the visiting masses do not have sufficient understanding of this issue, and there are many serious problems in the way of working, methods, systems, and the scope of accepted issues. For example, the leaders of some organs rarely pay attention to this work. Also, due to improper methods or mutual shirking of responsibility, the visitors have increased their dissatisfaction with the Party and the government, and some bad elements have taken advantage of loopholes due to multiple departments handling the same issues. To this end, the General Office of the CCP Central Committee and the General Office of the State Council immediately contacted the relevant departments, exchanged views on the scope of receiving people's visits by various organs, as well as the handling of employment issues of visiting masses, and drafted provisional measures in March, convened the heads of relevant organs on March 29 for preliminary discussion, and formally announced and implemented them on a trial basis at the meeting on the 11th.
    When analyzing the current situation of receiving people's visits, Comrade Yang Shangkun said that it is a legitimate way for the people to exercise their democratic rights to visit the Party and government leading organs and put forward their opinions and demands. For the leading organs, it is a barometer. Through it, we can know what the most acute problems are, strengthen our ties with the masses, help us discover and correct mistakes, and give us more opportunities to explain the policies of the Party and the government to the masses. Doing this work well can ease some internal contradictions among the people. And at present, it is also helpful to our rectification movement. Finally, he put forward the following requirements to the comrades who are doing the work of receiving visitors: First, be propagandists of the Party and government policies; second, be a bridge between the Party and the masses, with a serious, simple, modest, and sincere style, and learn to convince people with reason; third, frequently report situations and raise issues to higher-level leading organs; fourth, help change the bureaucratic work style in the organs.
    Comrade Xi Zhongxun said in his speech that many of our past shortcomings in the work of receiving visitors were caused by not caring about the suffering of the masses. This is a reflection of the changes in the lives and environment of our cadres after liberation, which have also caused changes in their thinking. Therefore, in this rectification movement, this work should be taken as one of the important contents of inspection. And he requires cadres above the level of Director-General (Department) to spend at least half a day each month personally talking to the visiting masses. He said that this will help change our leadership style. Therefore, he expressed that he would try and learn immediately. In his speech, he also specifically mentioned the issue of caring for the learning and rest of the cadres who receive visitors. He said that in order to ensure the realization of these conditions, even when streamlining institutions, some cadres can be considered to be added in this area.
    In their speeches, Comrade Yang Shangkun and Comrade Xi Zhongxun both mentioned that in the future, when various organs handle visits in a centralized manner, they should still proceed from the overall situation and have the spirit of being responsible to the end.
    The meeting also decided that in the future, each central unit should have a vice-minister responsible for leading the work of receiving visits.
    A total of more than fifty units and nine hundred people attended the meeting.

### 认真接待人民来访　缓和人民内部矛盾  中共中央办公厅和国务院秘书厅召集有关机关干部研究这个问题

    认真接待人民来访　缓和人民内部矛盾
    中共中央办公厅和国务院秘书厅召集有关机关干部研究这个问题
    本报讯　中共中央办公厅、国务院秘书厅于11日下午，召集中央级各党政机关、群众团体，以及北京市有关机关的干部，共同研究解决在接待人民来访工作中存在的问题。会上，中共中央办公厅主任杨尚昆、国务院秘书长习仲勋，先后就目前各中央级机关接待人民来访工作的状况、存在的问题，以及解决问题的办法等，作了报告。会上还公布了“中央内务部等十九个部门关于接待人民来访的范围（草案）”和关于“处理人民来访工作中几个具体问题的暂行办法”。
    在这次会议以前，中共中央办公厅和国务院秘书厅，听到各中央级机关普遍反映，最近一个时期，在接待来访的工作中有许多问题急待解决，曾经分别向所属各单位，以及北京市级有关单位作了调查。
    据调查，目前，有五十多个中央级机关有接待人民来访的工作。作此项工作的干部约有三百多人，他们在工作中一般都是勤勤恳恳、负责认真的。他们接谈的问题，至少有一半以上，得到比较完满而及时的解决。但是，随着形势的发展，也出现了一些新的情况和问题。这突出地表现在如下几个方面：首先，来访的人数大大地增多了。以内务部等二十一个单位为例，1956年接待的来访群众是四万二千人次，今年第一季度即增至二万二千四百人次。其中包括了多起过去较为少见的集体来访。而这些现象，估计在今后还要增多。其次，从来访者提出的要求看，据中共中央办公厅统计，以要求帮助解决就业和生活中的困难的为最多，约占总数的55％至60％以上，其他方面的问题，也多半与职业和生活问题有关。其中只有5％以下的人是属于无理取闹或系精神病患者。再从来访群众提出的具体问题看，其中很大一部分，反映了党政机关和干部的作风、制度、机构，同人民群众的要求之间的矛盾。这是国内阶级斗争减少和人民内部矛盾突出起来的重要标志。但是，很多机关的领导人和不少直接接待来访群众的同志，对这个问题没有足够的认识，而在工作的方式方法、制度、受理问题的范围等方面，都存在着很多严重问题。比如，有些机关的领导人，很少过问此项工作。再比如，由于方式方法的失当，或是由于互相推诿，使得来访者增加了对党和政府的不满，也有的由于多方受理，而使少数坏分子钻了空子。为此，中共中央办公厅和国务院秘书厅，当即与各有关部门联系，在3月间就各机关接待人民来访的范围、以及来访群众就业问题的归口、处理办法等交换了意见，草拟了暂行办法，于3月29日召集各有关机关的负责人，作了初步讨论，而在11日的会上正式公布试行。
    杨尚昆同志在分析当前接待人民来访工作的状况时说，人民群众访问党和政府的领导机关，提出自己的意见和要求，是运用自己的民主权利的正当手段。这对领导机关来说，它是一个寒暑表。通过它可以知道当前最尖锐的问题是什么，可以加强我们同群众的联系，可以帮助我们发现和纠正错误，可以使我们有更多的机会向群众解释党和政府的政策。作好这个工作，就可以缓和一部分人民内部矛盾。而在当前，对于我们的整风运动，也是有帮助的。最后，他向作来访工作的同志提出了如下几个要求：一、要成为党和政府政策的宣传人；二、要作党和群众之间的桥梁，作风要认真、朴素、虚心、诚恳，要学会以理服人；三、要经常向上级领导机关反映情况，提出问题；四、要帮助改变机关中的官僚主义作风。
    习仲勋同志在发言中说，我们过去在来访工作中的一些缺点，多半是由于不关心群众的疾苦造成的。这正是解放后我们干部的生活、环境的变化，在思想上也引起了变化的反映。因此，在这次整风中，应该把这项工作作为检查的重要内容之一。并且要求司局（处）长以上的干部，今后在一个月内，至少拿出半天的时间，亲自与来访的群众接谈。他说，这有助于改变我们的领导作风。因此，他表示自己马上就要试一试、学一学。他在发言中还特别提到了关心接待来访干部在学习、休息等方面的问题。他说，为了保证实现这些条件，虽然是在精简机构的时候，也可以考虑在这方面增加一些干部。
    杨尚昆同志和习仲勋同志在发言中，都曾提到，各机关在今后归口处理来访的情况下，仍要从全面出发，要有负责到底的精神。
    会上还确定，今后中央各单位，都要有一位副部长负责领导来访工作。
    出席此次会议的，共五十多个单位，九百人。
