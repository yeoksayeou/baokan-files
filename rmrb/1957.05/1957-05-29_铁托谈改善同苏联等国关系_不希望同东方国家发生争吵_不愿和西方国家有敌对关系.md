Xinhua News Agency, May 28th: According to a report by the Yugoslav News Agency, President Tito stated on the 27th that Yugoslavia hopes to cooperate with all countries and hopes to see an end to the arms race. He also said, "We are improving Yugoslavia's relations with the Soviet Union and other Eastern countries, and are focusing on the common ground that unites our countries."

Tito made these remarks during a speech at the ceremony for the start of electricity generation by the first generator of a hydroelectric power station in western Macedonia. He emphasized that coexistence is indispensable for the survival of mankind. He believes that not only should war be prohibited, but atomic and hydrogen weapons must also be banned.

Speaking about the normalization of relations between Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries, Tito traced the improvement of past relations and the changes after the Hungarian event. He believes that disagreements on the Hungarian event should not affect friendly relations. He expressed a heartfelt welcome to the current attitude taken by the leaders of certain Eastern countries, especially the Soviet Union, towards Yugoslavia. He said, "We have many things in common. They are building socialism in their own way, and we are building socialism in our own way. We will wholeheartedly and gladly adopt what we consider positive and useful in their methods. Conversely, we will always be happy to showcase what they consider good in our methods." He also said that it is their business which path they take. Our business should be to rejoice if they succeed, just as the reverse should also be true. Tito emphasized that we have no reason to quarrel, but should increasingly seek those factors that unite us, and make every effort to gradually eliminate the factors that separate us.

Speaking about Yugoslavia's relations with Western countries, Tito said that these countries have a capitalist system, which is a different system from our socialism. However, throughout the post-war period, up to the present day, we have not encountered any particular difficulties from that side that threaten our socialist system. We have good relations with the United States, Britain, France, and other Western countries, so why can't we continue in this direction? Tito also emphasized that Yugoslavia does not want hostile relations with the West, nor does it want to quarrel with the East. He said that the West should not object to Yugoslavia's desire to have good relations with the East, because we are united by the same goal – the development of socialism.

    铁托谈改善同苏联等国关系
    不希望同东方国家发生争吵
    不愿和西方国家有敌对关系
    据新华社28日讯　据南斯拉夫通讯社报道，铁托总统27日表示，南斯拉夫希望同一切国家合作，希望看到结束军备竞赛。他还说，我们正在改善南斯拉夫同苏联和其他东方国家的关系，正在着眼于使我们各国结合在一起的共同的东西。
    铁托是在马其顿西部一个水电站第一部发电机开始发电的典礼上发表演说时谈到这些问题的。他强调指出，共处对于人类的生存来说是不可缺少的。他认为，不仅要禁止战争，并且还必须禁止原子武器和氢武器。
    在谈到南斯拉夫同苏联和东欧国家关系的正常化问题时，铁托追溯了过去彼此间关系的改善和匈牙利事件以后的变化。他认为，对匈牙利事件看法上的不一致不应当影响相互间的友好关系。他表示衷心欢迎某些东方国家、特别是苏联的领导人目前对南斯拉夫所采取的态度。他说，我们有许多共同的东西。他们在用他们自己的方法建设社会主义，我们在用我们自己的方法建设社会主义。对于他们的方法中我们认为是积极、可用的东西，我们就衷心和高兴地采纳。反过来，我们将始终很高兴展示出我们方法中他们认为好的东西。他还说，他们将走哪一条道路是他们的事情。我们的事情应该是，如果它们成功了，那就为之高兴，正像反过来也应该如此一样。铁托强调说，我们没有理由争吵，而应当越来越多地寻求使我们联系在一起的那些因素，并且尽一切努力逐步消除使我们分离的因素。
    铁托在谈到南斯拉夫同西方国家的关系时说，这些国家有着一个资本主义制度，这是一种同我们的社会主义不同的制度。但是，整个战后期间，一直到今天，我们并没有遭到那方面威胁我们社会主义制度的任何特殊的困难。我们同美国、英国、法国以及其他西方国家有良好的关系，我们为什么不能够循着这个方向继续下去呢？铁托还着重表示，南斯拉夫不希望同西方有敌对关系，它也不希望同东方发生争吵。他说，西方不应该因为南斯拉夫希望同东方有良好关系而反对，因为我们是被同样的目的——发展社会主义——联结在一起的。
