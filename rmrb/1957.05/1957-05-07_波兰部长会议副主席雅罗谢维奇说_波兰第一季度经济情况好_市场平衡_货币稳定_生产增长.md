Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 6th - Polish Deputy Prime Minister Jaroszewicz recently told a reporter from the "Warsaw Life Daily" that Poland's economic achievements in the first four months of this year are satisfactory.

He believes that the most important positive phenomena in Poland's economic situation during this period are: maintaining market balance and complete stability in currency issuance; a considerable increase in the production of both food grains and industrial goods; and resolving market difficulties through the development of domestic production and the utilization of economic reserves.

The Deputy Prime Minister pointed out that the overall industrial production in the first quarter significantly exceeded the set targets, although the building materials, chemical fertilizer, and agricultural machinery industries did not fulfill their planned tasks. In rural areas, some farmers did not fulfill their delivery quotas. The increase in the purchase of agricultural products and their sales in cities is linked to the state's substantial increase in food purchase prices. Government expenditures for over-planned production in industry have also increased. The government is determined to do everything possible to maintain the stability of basic consumer goods prices.

Speaking about the economic development prospects for the second quarter, Jaroszewicz said that the production results for the first month of the second quarter are exciting. However, wages and rural incomes in this quarter will increase by approximately 2 billion zlotys compared to the first quarter, and the government must pay attention to maintaining market stability. Jaroszewicz expressed hope that workers will continue to over fulfill production tasks and that farmers will improve their quota deliveries to prevent price increases. He said, "We also hope to increase imported goods, but it must be emphasized: economic prosperity depends on our own efforts."

Regarding prices, Jaroszewicz pointed out that the prices of basic consumer goods have not changed. The government's decision to raise the prices of certain imported goods is not only due to comprehensive economic considerations but also to prevent speculation.

Regarding the issue of foreign investment in Poland, Jaroszewicz mentioned Poland's economic cooperation with East Germany and Czechoslovakia. He also mentioned that Poland has accepted the proposals from Britain, France, and Sweden regarding loans for the electrification of Polish railways and the construction of power stations. Poland will be able to fully repay the cost of railway electrification (including interest) within five years using the coal saved in this way.

    波兰部长会议副主席雅罗谢维奇说
    波兰第一季度经济情况好
    市场平衡　货币稳定　生产增长
    新华社华沙6日电　波兰部长会议副主席雅罗谢维奇最近对“华沙生活报”的记者说，波兰今年头四个月在经济方面获得的成绩是令人满意的。
    他认为，在这一期间的波兰经济状况中，最重要的好现象是：维持了市场的平衡和货币发行的完全稳定；商品粮食和工业品的生产都有相当大量的增长；通过发展国内生产和利用经济中的后备力量解决了市场上的困难。
    这位部长会议副主席指出，第一季度的工业生产总的来说显著地超额完成了任务，虽然建筑材料、化学肥料和农业机器工业没有完成计划的任务。在农村方面，一部分农民没有完成交售定额。农产品的收购量和在城市中的销售量的增加，是同国家大量增加了购买食品的价格联系着的。政府为工业中的超计划生产而付出的款项也增加了。政府决心尽一切可能来保持基本消费品价格的稳定。
    雅罗谢维奇在谈到第二季度的经济发展前景时说，第二季度头一个月的生产成绩是令人兴奋的。但是这一季度的工资和农村收入还要比第一季度增加约二十亿兹罗提，政府必须注意保持市场的稳定。雅罗谢维奇表示希望工人继续超额完成生产任务和改善农民的定额交售，以防止物价上涨。他说，我们也希望增加进口商品，但是必须强调：要依靠自己的努力来繁荣经济。
    关于物价的情况，雅罗谢维奇指出，基本消费品的价格没有变动。政府决定提高某些进口货物的价格不仅是由于全面的经济考虑，也是为了防止投机。
    关于外国在波兰投资的问题，雅罗谢维奇谈到了波兰同民主德国和捷克斯洛伐克的经济合作。他还谈到，波兰已经接受了英国、法国、瑞典所提出的关于对波兰铁路电气化和建设发电站给予贷款的建议。铁路电气化的费用（包括利息在内），波兰能够在五年内用这样节省下来的煤来全部加以偿还。
