Can't One Farm After Reading Books?
Xie Xingyao

The People's Daily editorial on April 8th, "On the Issue of Middle and High School Graduates Participating in Agricultural Production," mentioned that many students still have incorrect ideas and resist going to the countryside to farm. They are unwilling to be manual laborers, especially farmers, believing that being a farmer is "shameful" and "unpromising," etc. In short, they look down on farmers and are unwilling to participate in agricultural production. This shows that our labor education is still very poor, and young people do not have a correct understanding of labor.

I believe that this idea of ​​despising farmers and being unwilling to go to the countryside to farm is not a traditional Chinese thought. Because Chinese society has never looked down on farmers; it has always regarded farmers as symbols of loyalty and honesty; it has always regarded agricultural production as the foundation of the country; therefore, agriculture is called the "fundamental occupation." As for the so-called "all other professions are lowly, only studying is superior" in the feudal era, that referred to the imperial examination era, where reading could lead to officialdom and transformation into the ruling class. In the social hierarchy, scholars were ranked first, farmers second, and artisans and merchants third and fourth, known as the "four classes of people."

For two thousand years, social customs, habits, and language have reflected the importance of farmers. In the past, people generally regarded "passing on family traditions through farming and reading" as the standard for good people, "men farming and women weaving" as the model for working families, and praised someone for knowing hardship by saying they "came from the fields." Because we have long been an agricultural country, except for a very small number of ruling classes and exploiting classes, the vast majority of people need to cultivate the land and work hard. During the Han Dynasty, there was an election subject called "filial piety and diligent farming," and Emperor Wen of Han even issued an edict encouraging it, saying, "Diligent farming is the foundation of life." Originally, farming was the foundation of life at that time, so some people, even after becoming officials, would say they were "returning to farming" when they retired; soldiers who left the army were called "disbanding their armor and returning to the fields"; some intellectuals who did not climb up the ladder to get an official position and became writers were said to be "plowing with their pens," and their production tool, the inkstone, was called "inkstone field," meaning they were declaring that they were replacing the agricultural production they should be doing with mental labor.

In Chinese history, those who did not engage in agricultural production were most despised. Confucius, who was called a sage and a top-level intellectual, was satirized. When he was taking a group of disciples everywhere to find an official position, Zilu fell behind and didn't catch up, so he ran to ask an old man hoeing the ground: Have you seen my teacher? The old man said: You "don't move your limbs and don't know the five grains," how would I know who your teacher is? This old man made a sharp criticism of Confucius and his disciples for not going to the fields to work.

On the other hand, participating in agricultural labor was considered a glorious thing. Zhuge Liang is well known. In his "Chu Shi Biao" (Memorial on Dispatching the Army), he said that he was originally a commoner, "personally tilling the land in Nanyang," and planned to spend his life in a thatched cottage in the countryside. Whether he personally went to the fields to work while "sleeping soundly in Longzhong," covering his head and sleeping all day long, we have no way of proving. But he specifically mentioned this point to show that he was a member of the farmer ranks, and in his consciousness, at least, it can be said that he considered "personally tilling" as a glory in his life.

Also, Yan Yuan (Xizhai) and Li Gong (Shugu) were great thinkers and patriotic educators in the early Qing Dynasty, later known as the Yan-Li School. But they both personally went to the fields to produce, which is precisely their greatness. After the age of twenty, Yan Yuan personally "tilled the fields and irrigated the gardens, tempered himself through hard work," and lived a very difficult life; Li Gong, from the age of twenty-two, "farmed the land but it wasn't enough to support his parents," so he also "studied medicine and sold medicine." They farmed on the one hand and lectured on the other. In historical records, there are quite a few such figures.

All of these show that in our historical tradition, participating in agricultural production was considered glorious. Of course, our new society is essentially different from the past. Loving labor is a necessary quality for building a socialist society, not just to solve the problem of graduates who cannot go on to higher education. As for saying there is "no future," we know that participating in agricultural production means participating in socialist construction, and there are also opportunities to develop personal talents. Because in socialist society, personal honor is inseparable from labor contributions. Whoever labors well, society gives them honor. Young people should inherit the excellent tradition of valuing agricultural labor in our history and strive to be heroes on the farm.

    读了书就不能耕田吗？
    谢兴尧
    4月8日人民日报社论：“关于中小学毕业生参加农业生产问题”，中间谈到有不少的学生还存在着错误思想，对于下乡种地，在情绪上有抵触。他们不愿作体力劳动者，尤其不愿作农民，认为作了农民是“丢人”，“没出息”等等。总而言之是看不起农民，不愿意参加农业生产。这说明我们平日所进行的劳动教育还很差，青年人对于劳动，还没有正确的认识。
    我认为这种轻视农民、不愿下乡种地的思想，并不是咱们中国传统的思想。因为中国社会向来是不轻视农民的；向来是把农民当作忠厚朴实的象征的；向来是把农业生产看作是国之根本的；所以把农业称为“本业”。至于封建时代的所谓“万般皆下品，唯有读书高”，那是指科举时代而言，读了书便有机会作官，可以转变为统治阶级。在社会阶层中，它（士）算是第一位、农是第二位、工商是第三第四，叫作“四民”。
    两千年来，在社会风俗、习惯和语言中，都反映了重视农民的思想。从前一般人把“耕读传家”作为善良人士的标准，把“男耕女织”看成是劳动家庭的典范，称赞某一个人知道艰难困苦，常常说他“来自田间”。因为我们长远以来是以农立国，除了极少数的统治阶级、剥削阶级以外，绝大多数人都需要种地耕田、辛勤劳动。汉朝的选举科目，有“孝弟力田”一项，汉文帝还特别下诏鼓励说：“力田为生之本”。本来，在当时务农才是生活的基础，所以有些人虽然作了官，到他告老辞职的时候，还说是“归耕”；军人离开了军队，则称为“解甲归田”；一些知识分子没有爬上去得到一官半职，作了文字生涯的人，则说是“笔耕”，把他的生产工具墨盘，叫作“砚田”，意思就是声明他以脑力劳动代替他应该做的农业生产。
    在中国历史上，又最鄙视不事农业生产的人，被称为圣人、最高的高级知识分子孔老夫子，便被讽刺过。当他带着一群弟子到处去找官做的时候，子路落在后面没有赶上，跑去问一个锄地的老丈：你看见我的老师没有？老丈说：你们“四体不勤，五谷不分”，知道谁是你的老师？这个老丈对于没有下地劳动的孔子师徒，提出了尖锐的批评。
    另一方面，是以参加农业劳动为光荣的事情。诸葛亮是大家所知道的，在他的“出师表”中，说他自己本是一个布衣平民，“躬耕于南阳”，并且打算在乡下的茅庐中过一辈子。他“高卧隆中”，成天捂着脑袋睡大觉，是不是亲自下地劳动，我们无从证明。但是他特别提出这一点来，表示他是农民队伍中的一分子，在他的意识中，至少可以说：他认为“躬耕”是他生活上的光荣。
    还有颜元（习斋）和李塨（恕谷），是清朝初期伟大的思想家和爱国的教育家，后来称为颜李学派。但他们都亲自下地生产，这正是他们的伟大处。颜元在二十岁以后，亲身“耕田灌园，劳苦淬砺”，生活十分艰苦；李塨自二十二岁起，以“力田不足养亲”，又“习医卖药”。他们一方面耕田，一方面讲学，在历史记载中，这种人物还不少。
    这些，都说明了在我们历史传统上，是以参加农业生产为光荣的。当然，我们现在的新社会与过去有着本质上的不同，热爱劳动是建设社会主义社会所必须具备的品质，不是单纯为解决不能升学的毕业生的问题。至于说“没有前途”，我们知道参加农业生产，就是参加社会主义建设，同样有发展个人才能的机会。因为在社会主义社会，个人的荣誉和他的劳动贡献是分不开的，谁的劳动好，社会就给谁荣誉。青年人应该继承我们历史上重视农业劳动的优秀传统，同时争取作一个农场上的英雄。
