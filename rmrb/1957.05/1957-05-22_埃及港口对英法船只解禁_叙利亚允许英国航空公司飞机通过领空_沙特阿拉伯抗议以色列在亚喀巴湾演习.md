    埃及港口对英法船只解禁

    沙特阿拉伯抗议以色列在亚喀巴湾演习
    新华社开罗21日电　埃及的苏伊士运河当局5月20日撤销了一切对英、法两国船只的惩罚性措施。
    埃及允许英法船只今后可以进入埃及港口，卸下运往埃及的或准备转运到其它国家的货物。埃及还将允许英法船只装运埃及的出口货物。
    埃及对英法船只惩罚性的措施，是从去年11月英法对埃及发动侵略战争之后开始实行的。
    同时据报道，美国军舰决定从5月22日起恢复通行苏伊士运河。从去年11月以来，美国军舰一直停止通过苏伊士运河。
    新华社21日讯　伦敦消息：英国海外航空公司发言人5月17日说，叙利亚政府已经允许英国海外航空公司恢复通过叙利亚领空的航线。
    在英法进攻埃及以后，叙利亚政府就在去年10月30日宣布关闭叙利亚的所有机场，并且也禁止外国飞机飞过叙利亚领空。
    据新华社开罗21日电　中东通讯社报道，沙特阿拉伯已经就以色列在亚喀巴湾中举行海军演习向联合国安全理事会提出抗议。沙特阿拉伯驻埃及大使馆已经把抗议照会的抄件全文送交埃及外交部。
    照会说，以色列海军部队最近在亚喀巴湾进行的演习是挑衅行为，目的是企图得到自由通过沙特阿拉伯领水内的亚喀巴湾的权利。
