    Don't Be Afraid of Being Besieged, Don't Be Afraid of Being Attacked
    Industrialists and Businessmen Should Fully Unleash and Voice Their Opinions
    Heads of Industry and Commerce Federations in Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai Hold Discussions

    (Our Newspaper’s Report) The All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce invited chairmen, vice-chairmen, and committee members from industry and commerce federations in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and other places yesterday to discuss how to correctly handle contradictions among the people. After Chen Shutong, chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, explained the topics and requirements for the discussion, Yan Shaoqing, Chen Zuying, Liu Ruijiu, Li Jingyang, Song Xinquan, Rong Yiren, Hu Ziang, Guo Dihuo, Zhang Naiqi, Sun Fuling and others spoke at the meeting. They unanimously agreed that the Federation of Industry and Commerce should work hard to eliminate the concerns of industrialists and businessmen and encourage them to be bold in unleashing and voicing their opinions.

    Chen Zuying said: Private personnel are like new daughters-in-law, unable to figure out the temperaments of their mothers-in-law and husbands, and dare not unleash or voice opinions.

    Speakers believed that after Chairman Mao's speech at the Supreme State Conference was disseminated in various places, industrialists and businessmen were very excited, and many wanted to unleash and voice their opinions; however, there were still many concerns. Yan Shaoqing, a member of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce, said: In the past, the industrial and commercial sector was in an icy and snowy situation, and even if there were flowers, they could not bloom. Although the situation has changed somewhat now, many people are still trembling and taking a wait-and-see attitude because they are afraid of being attacked by enterprise leaders. Chen Zuying from the Tianjin industrial and commercial sector compared the private personnel after the full industry amalgamation to newly married daughters-in-law because they could not figure out the temperaments of the "mothers-in-law" and "husbands" (referring to public representatives), so they dared not unleash or voice their opinions. Liu Ruijiu, a member of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce, believed that because many private personnel felt that their fate was in the hands of the public representatives, they were afraid of damaging the relationship, which would be detrimental to them, and even lead to retaliation. Even though they clearly had opinions on many things, they dared not express them. Li Jingyang from the Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce and Song Xinquan, a member of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce, and others said: There are many contradictions in the industrial and commercial sector, and some people have already been unleashing and voicing their opinions. For example, many people have opinions on the wage and benefit issues of small industrial and commercial households, as well as the issue of sick leave wages, and they have repeatedly reported these issues to the Federation of Industry and Commerce and administrative leading organs; however, not only have many problems not been resolved, but people who raise opinions have been labeled with big hats such as being ideologically backward and stubborn. Therefore, in order for the industrial and commercial sector to truly unleash and voice their opinions, on the one hand, the China Democratic National Construction Association and the Federation of Industry and Commerce must make great efforts to dispel the concerns of industrialists and businessmen, and should not, as in the past, often list those who dare to raise opinions and reflect problems in the "ideological problems" column, and should not rush to criticize wrong ideas. In this regard, the China Democratic National Construction Association and the Federation of Industry and Commerce should ideally make organizational guarantees so that industrialists and businessmen can get rid of the feeling of being besieged or retaliated against. On the other hand, industrialists and businessmen should also feel that they are not being asked to unleash and voice their opinions for the sake of unleashing and voicing; as long as the problems they expose and reflect are reasonable and can be solved, such as some problems related to wages, benefits, and living welfare, they should be solved in a timely manner; otherwise, if they are still just paying lip service and only talking about general principles, the industrial and commercial sector will not be able to unleash and voice their opinions.

    Hu Ziang said: We should advocate unleashing as much as possible and not rush to criticize; otherwise, it will dampen enthusiasm.

    Some people at the meeting also mentioned that many industrialists and businessmen still have an unclear understanding of the "unleashing" and "voicing" policy. Rong Yiren, vice-chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, said: To what extent should unleashing be done, and what is the relationship between unleashing and收 (contraction/tightening up), is not very clear to every industrialist and businessman. Some people are afraid of being dealt with in the future if they unleash too much. He believes that only by unleashing can there be收; and the purpose of 收 is also to improve thinking and unify understanding through the formula of "unity-criticism-unity," not to deal with anyone. Therefore, we should unleash as much as possible, especially the Federation of Industry and Commerce should unleash first. Hu Ziang, vice-chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, and Liu Ruijiu, a member of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce, both mentioned that some industrialists and businessmen have the idea of ​​being outside the "blooming and contending" principle, thinking that this is only a matter for the cultural, educational, and scientific circles, and has nothing to do with the industrial and commercial sector. They believe that this idea is wrong. Hu Ziang advocated that we should advocate unleashing as much as possible and not rush to criticize; otherwise, it will dampen enthusiasm.

    Rong Yiren and Guo Dihuo, a member of the Standing Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, both talked about the issue of remuneration for capitalist agents, believing that there are many difficulties if the government does not manage this issue and it is left to private personnel to negotiate and resolve themselves. Rong Yiren said: The government has a responsibility to assist in resolving all issues related to contradictions among the people.

    Yan Shaoqing said: The Federation of Industry and Commerce has not well represented the legitimate interests of the industrial and commercial sector and has become a "police station" of the government.

    Many industrialists and businessmen present criticized the past leadership of the Federation of Industry and Commerce (including the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce). Yan Shaoqing, a member of the Standing Committee of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce, believes that the Federation of Industry and Commerce has not been able to become a real industrial and commercial organization, has not well represented their legitimate interests, and has not fully reflected their opinions and requirements, but has become a "police station" of the government. The speeches of many leaders in the industrial and commercial sector are often very stable and copied from the reports of leaders; and they often talk about big principles and educate from the positive side. Song Xinquan from the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce said: A leader of the Federation of Industry and Commerce once talked to industrialists and businessmen about the issue of sick leave wages, and talked about many big principles. Someone handed him a note from the audience. The note was written by a private employee who only earns 70 yuan a month. He and his wife both suffer from serious illnesses and need rest and treatment. According to regulations, he can only get 30% of his sick leave wages, and he has great difficulties in life; due to economic difficulties and in order to take care of the elderly, his daughter who was studying at university had to drop out. This private employee asked the speaker: How is your sick leave wage problem solved? The speaker could not answer because he enjoyed the same treatment as the workers and did not have such a problem at all.

    Liu Ruijiu said: There is no voice from the industrial and commercial sector in the "Industry and Commerce Monthly," and it is mostly formulaic preaching.

    Liu Ruijiu said: Although the "Industry and Commerce Monthly" is a publication of the industrial and commercial sector, many industrialists and businessmen do not like to read it because there is no voice from the industrial and commercial sector in it, and it is mostly formulaic preaching. Many people mentioned in their speeches that due to the existence of these shortcomings, the Federation of Industry and Commerce and its many leaders have become seriously divorced from the masses, and their work has greatly lagged behind the development of the objective situation. Therefore, in order for the industrial and commercial sector to dare to rise up and contend, the leaders of the industrial and commercial sector should first break through their concerns and speak out what is in their hearts on behalf of the industrial and commercial sector.

    Zhang Naiqi said: Industrialists and businessmen should actively participate in the contention, and never falsely report "military intelligence" or conceal "medical conditions."

    Zhang Naiqi, vice-chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, talked about the ideological transformation of the industrial and commercial sector at the meeting. He believes that for industrialists and businessmen to transform their ideology well, the most important condition is that they must be loyal, honest, and realistic, believe in the Communist Party's policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," and "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision," actively participate in the contention, and say everything in their hearts, and never falsely report "military intelligence" or conceal "medical conditions"; otherwise, it will not only be wrong but will also delay the timing and hinder the transformation. He said: As far as I know, many people in the industrial and commercial sector have falsely reported "military intelligence" in the past. Some people have reported it lightly, but most have reported it heavily. This is because they have not realized that loyalty and honesty are one of the important essences of the working class. He encouraged industrialists and businessmen, saying: When voicing opinions, be bold; when unleashing, be thorough; doing so will not only not aggravate the contradiction between the bourgeoisie and the working class, but also ease the contradiction between the two classes. Therefore, when making suggestions, do not beat around the bush or be polite; do not be afraid of being labeled with "hats"; do not be afraid of retaliation. In the future, the China Democratic National Construction Association and the Federation of Industry and Commerce should truthfully reflect the situation of the industrial and commercial sector, and provide a full guarantee that those who dare to unleash and voice their opinions will not be retaliated against. He also said: It is excessive to demand that right and wrong be clarified all at once. However, we have confidence that in our people's country, right and wrong will be clear, and will become clearer and clearer in the future.

    Many people said: There is a high wall between the public and private sectors, mainly because public personnel do not trust them.

    Many people who spoke at the meeting also analyzed the various types of contradictions in the industrial and commercial sector, including contradictions between the public and private sectors, contradictions between private sectors, and contradictions within the Federation of Industry and Commerce. All these contradictions should be exposed through "blooming and contending" and, in accordance with the formula of "unity-criticism-unity," should be resolved as reasonably as possible. When talking about the contradictions between the public and private sectors, they believed that one of the main reasons why there is a high wall between the public and private personnel is that many public representatives and workers still look at private personnel with old eyes, do not trust them politically, and even dare not approach them in life, still holding a respectful but distant attitude. Sun Fuling, vice-chairman of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce, said: Daoxiangchun Food Store is an old joint venture store. The manager of the store, Xu Jinqing, has been engaged in food and local product work for many years; and the store also has a party branch and trade union organization, but the higher authorities still do not trust him enough and sent a comrade who is not familiar with local food products to be the public representative, which has only increased many troubles. He believes that similar joint venture enterprises should trust private personnel and boldly use them. Li Jingyang from the Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce said: Many public representatives do not respect the authority of private personnel enough, they cannot see the documents they should see, and they are not consulted on opinions that should be solicited. The rationalization proposals put forward by private personnel are also rarely supported and adopted. These have affected the enthusiasm of private personnel, who are afraid of raising more opinions and managing more work, and being labeled with a hat of usurping leadership, so they are also respectful but distant from public personnel. He also mentioned: At present, many workers in joint venture enterprises do not have a deep understanding of the redemption policy, thinking that with fixed interest, private personnel are still exploiting them; in the past, you were pressing down on us, and today you are still doing well, and they are very unconvinced. Therefore, a decision is often easier for public personnel to implement, and when private personnel come forward, they are pushed back.

### 不要怕被围剿　不要怕被打击  工商业者要大放大鸣  北京、天津、上海工商联负责人举行座谈

    不要怕被围剿　不要怕被打击
    工商业者要大放大鸣
    北京、天津、上海工商联负责人举行座谈
    本报讯　中华全国工商业联合会，于昨天邀请北京、天津、上海等地工商联的主任委员、副主任委员和委员等，座谈如何正确处理人民内部矛盾。中华全国工商业联合会主任委员陈叔通说明座谈会的议题和要求以后，在会上发言的有阎少青、陈祖瀛、刘瑞九、李景阳、宋鑫泉、荣毅仁、胡子昂、郭棣活、章乃器、孙孚凌等人。他们一致认为，工商联应当努力消除工商业者的顾虑，鼓励他们大胆地放，大胆地鸣。
    陈祖瀛说：私方人员好比新媳妇，摸不透婆婆和丈夫的脾气，不敢放，不敢鸣。
    发言的人认为，毛主席在最高国务会议上的讲话在各地传达以后，工商业者都非常兴奋，许多人都想放一放，鸣一鸣；但是也还有许多顾虑。北京市工商联委员阎少青说：过去工商界处在冰天雪地之下，有花也放不出来。现在的情况虽然有所改变，但许多人还是战战兢兢的，抱着观望的态度，因为他们怕受到企业领导人的打击。天津市工商界的陈祖瀛，把全行业合营后的私方人员比作刚嫁过门的新媳妇，因为摸不清、也摸不透婆婆和丈夫（指公方代表）的脾气，所以不敢放，不敢鸣。北京市工商联委员刘瑞九认为，由于许多私方人员觉得自己的命运掌握在公方手中，害怕搞坏了关系对自己不利，甚至遭到打击报复，虽然明明对许多事情有意见也不敢提。天津市工商联李景阳和北京市工商联委员宋鑫泉等都说：工商界中的矛盾是很多的，而且早就有人在那里放，在那里鸣。例如，对工商业小户的工资待遇问题、病假工资问题等，很多人都有意见，曾经三番五次地反映到工商联和行政领导机关；可是不但许多问题没有得到解决，反而给提意见的人扣上思想落后、顽固等大帽子。因此，为要使工商界真正鸣起来、放起来，一方面是民建会和工商联要大力解除工商业者的顾虑，不要像过去常常把敢于提意见和反映问题的人列入“有思想问题”的一栏，并且不要急于对错误的思想进行批判。在这方面，民建会和工商联最好能够作出组织上的保证，使工商业者去掉怕被围剿、怕被打击报复的感觉。另一方面，还应使工商业者感觉到，不是要他们为放而放，为鸣而鸣，只要揭发反映的问题是合理的、能够解决的，例如有关工资待遇和生活福利上的一些问题，就应该及时地加以解决；否则，如果仍然是空口说白话，只讲大原则大道理，工商界也是鸣不起来、放不起来的。
    胡子昂说：应该提倡尽量放，不要急于批判；否则就会打击积极性。
    会上还有人提到，目前还有许多工商业者，对“放”和“鸣”的方针认识不清。全国工商联副主任委员荣毅仁说：放应放到什么程度，放和收的关系怎样，还不是每个工商业者都很明确的，有人害怕放了将来挨整。他认为，只有放，才有收；而收的目的，也是通过“团结——批评——团结”的公式，来提高思想，统一认识，不是为了整谁。所以应当大放特放，尤其是工商联应当首先放。全国工商联副主任委员胡子昂和北京市工商联委员刘瑞九都提到，有些工商业者有置身于齐放和争鸣之外的思想，以为这只是文教科学界的事，没有工商界的份。他们认为，这种想法是不对的。胡子昂主张，当前应该提倡尽量放，不要急于批判；否则，就会打击了积极性。
    荣毅仁和全国工商联常委郭棣活，都谈到资方代理人的酬劳金问题，认为这个问题政府不管，由私方人员自己协商解决，有许多困难。荣毅仁说：凡是有关人民内部矛盾的问题，政府都有责任协助解决。
    阎少青说：工商联没有很好代表工商界的合法利益，变成政府的“派出所”。
    到会的许多工商界人士，批评了工商联（包括全国工商联）过去的领导工作。北京市工商联常委阎少青认为：工商联没有能够成为名实相符的工商界自己的组织，没有很好地代表他们的合法利益，充分地反映他们的意见和要求，而是变成了政府的“派出所”。许多工商界领导人的讲话，常常是四平八稳的，从首长的报告抄来的；而且是讲大道理的时候多，从正面进行教育的时候多。北京市工商联的宋鑫泉说：有个工商联的领导人，有次向工商业者讲病假工资问题，谈了许多大道理，台下有人给他递了一个条子。这个条子是一个每月只拿七十元工资的私方人员写的，他和他的妻子都患有严重的疾病，需要休息和治疗。按规定，他只能拿到30％的病假工资，生活上的困难很大；因为经济困难和为了侍候老人，他的在大学读书的女儿不得不中途退学。这个私方人员问报告人说：你的病假工资问题是怎样解决的？报告人无法回答，因为他和职工享受一样的待遇，根本不发生这样的问题。
    刘瑞九说：工商月刊里没有工商界的声音，多是公式化的说教。
    刘瑞九说：工商月刊虽然是工商界自己的刊物，但是许多工商业者都不爱看，因为里面没有工商界的声音，多是公式化的说教。许多人在发言中都提到，由于这些缺点的存在，已经使工商联和它的许多领导人严重地脱离了群众，它们的工作大大地落后于客观形势的发展。因此，为要使工商界敢于起来争鸣，工商界的领导人应当首先打破顾虑，代表工商界说出他们心里的话。
    章乃器说：工商业者应积极参加争鸣，决不要谎报“军情”和隐瞒“病情”。
    全国工商联副主任委员章乃器，在会上谈到工商界的思想改造。他认为，工商业者为要把自己的思想改造好，最重要的条件就是必须忠诚老实、实事求是，相信共产党的“百花齐放、百家争鸣”、“长期共存、互相监督”的方针，积极地参加争鸣，把心里的话都讲出来，决不要谎报“军情”和隐瞒“病情”；否则就不仅是错误的，而且会延误时机，妨害改造。他说：据我了解，过去工商界有不少人谎报“军情”，把“军情”报得轻的人固然有，但多数是报重了。这是没有认识到忠诚老实是工人阶级的重要本质之一。他鼓励工商业者说：鸣就要大胆地鸣，放就要彻底地放；这样作，不但不会加剧资产阶级和工人阶级的矛盾，而且能够缓和这两个阶级之间的矛盾。因此，提意见不要转弯抹角，不要客客气气；不要怕戴“帽子”；不要怕打击报复。今后，民建会和工商联，要把工商界的情况不折不扣地反映上来，并且要给予敢放敢鸣的人不会受到打击报复的完全保证。他还说：要求一时就把是非弄清是过分的。但是，我们有信心，在我们人民的国家里，是非一定会明的，而且愈往后会愈明。
    许多人说：公私双方之间有一道高墙，主要原因是公方人员不信任他们。
    在会上发言的许多人，还一一地分析了工商界中间的各类矛盾，其中有公私之间矛盾，也有私私之间的矛盾，还有工商联内部的矛盾。所有这些矛盾，都应当通过齐放和争鸣暴露出来，并且本着“团结——批评——团结”的公式，尽可能求得合理的解决。在谈到公私矛 盾时，他们认为公私双方人员之间所以有一道高墙，主要原因之一是许多公方代表和职工仍然用旧眼光来看私方人员，在政治上不信任他们，甚至在生活上也不敢和他们接近，还是抱着一种敬而远之的态度。北京市工商联副主任委员孙孚凌说：稻香春食品店是个老合营商店，该店经理许晋卿多年从事食品土产工作；而且该店又有党支部和工会的组织，可是上级还是对他不够相信，派了一个对土产食品外行的同志去作公方代表，结果反而增加了许多麻烦。他认为，类似这样的合营企业，就应该相信私方人员，大胆地使用他们。天津市工商联的李景阳说：许多公方代表对私方人员的职权不够尊重，应该看的文件看不到，应该征求意见的不征求意见。私方人员提出的合理化建议，也很少得到支持和采纳。这些，都影响了私方人员的积极性，他们怕多提了意见和多管了工作，给扣上个篡夺领导权的帽子，因而对公方人员也是敬而远之。他还提到：目前许多合营企业的职工对赎买政策的认识还不深刻，以为有定息存在，私方人员就是还在剥削他们；过去是你们压在我们头上，今天还是你们吃得开，心里很不服气。因此，一个决定，往往公方人员容易往下贯彻，私方人员出面就给碰了回来。
