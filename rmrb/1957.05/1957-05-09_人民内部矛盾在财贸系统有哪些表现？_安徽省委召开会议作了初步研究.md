Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 6th: What are the manifestations of contradictions among the people within the financial and trade system? How to resolve them? The Anhui Provincial Party Committee conducted a preliminary study on this issue at a meeting of financial and trade department heads from various prefectural and municipal Party committees, held from April 25th to May 2nd.

According to the situation in Anhui, the meeting believed that contradictions among the people in the financial and trade system are manifested as follows: the possible quantity, variety, and assortment of goods supplied cannot meet the people's growing needs; the relationship between industrial and commercial sectors is not very coordinated, and profit distribution is not appropriate enough; some unreasonable phenomena still exist in the purchase prices of certain agricultural and sideline products, as well as in the pricing of goods in areas bordering provinces, free market prices, and state-set prices; some problems also exist within commercial departments in terms of goods allocation, plan alignment, and between leaders and those being led. In addition to objective reasons, the emergence of these contradictions is mainly due to the serious bureaucratic work style within the financial and trade departments. For example, regarding the supply of goods, some commodities are in short supply, and the fundamental reason is that the growth rate of production cannot keep up with the needs of consumption. If the actual situation is explained clearly and specifically, it can gain the understanding of the people, and the contradictions can be reduced. In terms of agricultural product procurement, the phenomena of purchasing in offices and suppressing prices at each level are still relatively serious, leading to dissatisfaction among the people.

The meeting believed that persuasion and education, criticism and self-criticism, and free debate should be adopted to correctly handle these contradictions. The specific methods are: first, strengthen publicity and explanation work, clearly explain to the people why some commodities are in short supply, require everyone to combine immediate interests with long-term interests, and help the country overcome difficulties in material supply; second, improve supply work, change the bureaucratic work style of commercial departments, and make reasonable adjustments in business hours and labor organization to facilitate the masses; third, adopt methods such as exchanging information and disclosing costs to strengthen the relationship between commercial and industrial sectors; fourth, for the purchase of bulk agricultural products, implement the method of in-depth procurement in agricultural cooperatives, and invite representatives of agricultural cooperatives to participate in grading and evaluation to correct the phenomena of giving prices that are too high or too low in procurement; fifth, strengthen ties with neighboring provinces, consult on matters, communicate with each other, and resolve the problem of large price differences in neighboring areas; sixth, carry out criticism and self-criticism, and fully promote democracy. In addition, the meeting also required heads of various trade units to personally work at counters for a certain period of time to receive and sell goods, thereby strengthening the relationship between leaders and the masses.

    人民内部矛盾在财贸系统有哪些表现？
    安徽省委召开会议作了初步研究
    据新华社合肥6日电　人民内部矛盾在财经贸易系统有哪些表现？怎样解决？中共安徽省委在4月25日到5月2日召开的地市委财贸部长会议上，作了初步的研究。
    根据安徽的情况，会议认为，人民内部矛盾在财贸系统表现为：物资的可能供应数量、花色、品种不能满足人民日益增长的需要；工业部门和商业部门关系不很协调，利润分配不够恰当；有些农副产品的收购价格以及省与省之间的接壤地区商品作价、自由市场价格与国家牌价等方面，还存在着一些不合理的现象；商业部门内部的货源分配和计划衔接以及领导与被领导之间，也都存在一些问题。这些矛盾的产生，除了客观原因以外，主要是财贸部门存在着严重的官僚主义作风。比如，在物资供应方面，有些商品供不应求，根本原因是生产的增长速度赶不上消费的需要，如果把实际情况具体地讲清楚，是能够取得人民群众的谅解的，矛盾是可以缩小的。在农产品采购方面，坐在机关收购和压级压价的现象还比较严重，以致引起人民群众的不满。
    会议认为，应该采取说服教育的方法，批评与自我批评的方法，自由争辩的方法，正确地处理这些矛盾。具体的作法：首先加强宣传解释工作，向人民群众说清楚部分商品为什么供不应求，要求大家把眼前利益和长远利益结合起来，帮助国家克服物资供应上的困难；其次，改进供应工作，改变商业部门机关化的作风，在营业时间和劳动力组织方面，必须进行合理的调整，以便利群众；第三，采取交流情况，公开成本等办法，密切商业和工业部门的关系；第四，对大宗农产品的收购，要实行深入农业社收购的办法，并且邀请农业社代表参加评级评价，纠正收购中给价偏高偏低的现象；第五，密切与邻省的联系，要遇事协商，互通声气，解决毗邻地区物价悬殊的问题；第六，开展批评与自我批评，充分发扬民主。另外，会议还要求各贸易单位负责人必须以一定时间亲自上柜台收货、卖货，从而密切领导与群众之间的关系。
