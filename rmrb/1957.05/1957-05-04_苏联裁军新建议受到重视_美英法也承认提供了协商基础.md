Xinhua News Agency, 2nd dispatch. The United States, Britain, and France are studying the new proposals on disarmament put forward by the Soviet representative to the Disarmament Subcommittee on April 30th. The meeting of this committee has adjourned and will reconvene on the 6th.

President Eisenhower has instructed the State Department to conduct a "detailed study" of this proposal. State Department spokesman White said on the 1st that the United States will "carefully study" the proposal before the American representative attending the committee meeting makes a detailed response.

It is said that the Soviet Union's new proposal to allow "aerial inspection" over part of Soviet territory has attracted great attention from American人士 (ren shi - people/figures). American disarmament delegation人士 (ren shi - people/figures) in London stated that the Soviet proposal is unacceptable, but it may be the "first step" to reaching an agreement between countries. Some authorities in Washington believe that the Soviet proposal "may have room for further consultation."

London also stated that it is carefully studying the Soviet proposal. Sources say that although the British government does not seem likely to accept the Soviet proposal in its current form, it believes it could provide ground for useful discussions and does not rule out the possibility of reaching some agreements in the end.

French representative to the Disarmament Subcommittee, Moch, commented on the Soviet proposal, saying that it showed the Soviet Union had made concessions on certain disarmament issues and that the Soviet Union was willing to continue negotiations. But he insisted that the area proposed by the Soviet proposal for aerial inspection was "not enough" and that the entire proposal still had "major shortcomings."

    苏联裁军新建议受到重视
    美英法也承认提供了协商基础
    新华社2日讯　美、英、法三国正在研究苏联代表4月30日在裁军小组委员会上提出的关于裁军问题的新建议。这个委员会会议已经休会，要到6日再度复会。
    美国总统艾森豪威尔训令国务院对这个建议进行“详细的研究”。国务院发言人怀特1日说，美国将“好好地研究”这个建议，然后再由出席这个委员会会议的美国代表提出详细的答复。
    据说，苏联的这个同意在苏联一部分领土上进行“空中视察”的新建议引起了美国人士很大注意。在伦敦的美国裁军代表团人士表示，苏联的建议是不可能接受的，但它可能是使得各国获得协议的“第一个步骤”。华盛顿一些权威人士认为，苏联的建议“可能有进一步协商的余地”。
    伦敦方面也表示正在对苏联的建议进行仔细的研究。有消息说，英国政府虽然看来不会接受目前形式的苏联建议，但是认为有可能提供进行有益的讨论的园地，并且不排斥最后达成某些协议的可能性。
    法国出席裁军小组委员会的代表莫克在评论苏联的建议时说，这个建议表明苏联在裁军的某些问题上作了让步，并且表明苏联愿意继续进行谈判。但是他又硬说，苏联建议提出的关于空中视察的地区是“不够”的，整个建议还有“重大的缺点”。
