Should there be Public Representatives in Joint Ventures? Should there be a Party Member Secretary-General in the Federation of Industry and Commerce?
Speeches by Business Leaders at the Ninth Symposium Held by the United Front Work Department
Wen Shaohe suggested implementing collective administrative leadership under the leadership of the public side.

Wen Shaohe, Acting Chairman of the Chongqing Federation of Industry and Commerce, reflected at the meeting the opinions of the Chongqing business community on issues such as public-private partnership, ideological remolding, fixed interest rates, and joining trade unions. He also put forward the following suggestions:
　　(1) Under the leadership of the public side, establish a collective administrative leadership for the enterprise and implement an administrative responsibility system. The policy direction of the enterprise should be led by the public side, and the administrative heads of both the public and private sides should each be responsible for their administrative duties, ensuring that they have positions, powers, and responsibilities.
　　(2) Regarding the request of small and medium-sized industrial and commercial owners to waive fixed interest, it should be resolved individually when conditions are ripe, and the public side of the joint venture should be responsible for handling it. Private-side agents should also be allowed to join the trade union if they meet the requirements.

Finally, he requested that the Federation of Industry and Commerce continue to help industrialists and businessmen carry out ideological remolding, continue to represent their legitimate interests, care about their work, study, and life, reflect their opinions and demands, and help solve difficulties in work and life.
Wu Jiasun believes: The public representative system cannot be abolished now, but it can be abolished in the future.

Wu Jiasun, Director of the Suzhou Municipal Private Industry and Commerce Transformation Counseling Office, expressed his views on whether a public representative system is needed in public-private joint ventures.

He believes that private personnel currently have great enthusiasm for socialist transformation and also possess production technology and management skills. They generally want to run the enterprise well. However, it cannot be said that they are completely free from the bourgeois standpoint, viewpoints, and ways of thinking. Many private personnel, because their salaries are fixed, adopt a policy of self-preservation, feeling that it is better to do nothing than to make a mistake, and they do not seek merit but only seek to avoid demerit. Some people occasionally show doubt and wavering attitudes towards the socialist cause. In this state of mind, they cannot assume the leading responsibility for dual transformation.

Joint ventures must use socialist principles as the fundamental guideline for transforming enterprises and leading the masses, and private personnel lack this ability even more.

From the current objective conditions, the public representative system has been supported by the entire working class. After the joint venture, workers warmly welcomed public representatives to the factory, and their enthusiasm for production was unprecedentedly high. Today, to abolish the public representative system, this aspect must be considered.

At the same time, although the contradictions between classes have been basically resolved, this does not mean that they have been completely resolved. The impression of the long-term cruel exploitation by the bourgeoisie on the working class is still very deep. Although the working class is selfless and focuses on the long-term interests of socialism, not bearing old grudges, class feelings cannot be quickly transformed immediately. In this aspect, private personnel still need to make active efforts to shorten the distance between the two sides through work. We cannot forget that before the joint venture, the main contradiction in the enterprise was labor-capital disputes. Today, the labor-capital relationship is relatively good and peaceful, on the one hand, because the ownership of the means of production has changed, and on the other hand, because there are public representatives in the enterprise, which makes the public-private relationship cover up the labor-capital relationship. Can we imagine that abolishing the public representative system will guarantee that there will be no contradictions between labor and private sides? Wouldn't it be more troublesome to ask the government to arbitrate and ask public representatives to return to the factory when contradictions occur?

From the above situation, it is unfavorable to abolish the public representative system at present for production, enterprise transformation, and the transformation of private personnel. The public representative system is conducive to dual transformation. The current problem lies in improving the ideological level and ability of public representatives on the one hand, and in giving play to the collective leadership of the enterprise, both giving play to the leading role of public representatives in the enterprise and giving play to the socialist enthusiasm of private personnel. Therefore, studying the collective leadership system in enterprises is a very specific and practical issue, that is, studying how to improve the democratic management committee and strengthen supervision.

It is impossible to withdraw public representatives now, so can it be done in the future? That is, can private personnel be allowed to fully assume the leadership responsibility of the enterprise in the future? I think it is possible, otherwise, it would be equivalent to saying that peaceful transformation is impossible. If it is impossible to withdraw public representatives in the future, it means that there is a problem with the implementation of the policy, that is, private personnel have not been ideologically transformed well. To what extent should private personnel be transformed to be considered good? I think it should have the following three conditions: First, have unlimited and firm confidence in socialism, and when the socialist cause encounters difficulties, not only not wavering, but also assisting the Party to overcome difficulties, which means that in terms of ideological consciousness, there is only a positive side to socialism, and no negative side. Second, have a common ideology and common language with the working class, that is, there is only a comrade relationship in the enterprise, and no class relationship. Third, have the ability to lead the masses of workers and staff according to socialist principles.

He said: Proposing the abolition of the public representative system is not simply a negative manifestation.

Wu Jiasun said: Why do some industrialists and businessmen, even activists, propose to abolish the public representative system now? I think this is precisely a reflection of the abnormal public-private relationship in the current joint ventures. (Such as insufficient trust and care for the private side, etc.) The specific manifestations are as follows:

The proposal of these people to abolish the public representative system itself has positive factors, that is, it shows that they dare to assume the responsibility of production and operation in the enterprise. Failing to see this point will lead to mistakes in handling this issue. Some economists who study problems behind closed doors cannot understand the difficulties of private personnel, and therefore think that it is the growth of negativity, or the frivolity, exaggeration, and rejection of socialism of private personnel, etc. Therefore, on the premise of affirming that the public representative system cannot be abolished at present, it is necessary to meet the reasonable demands of private personnel to have positions and powers, so as to facilitate dual transformation.

Finally, he suggested: First, all public personnel must trust the private side, give the private side positions and powers, eliminate all artificial obstacles, and fully provide work conditions to transform the private side through work practice. Today, pointing out that there are two relationships in public-private joint ventures is not to preserve the two relationships forever, but to eliminate the two relationships more quickly. In order to promote and supervise the public and private sides to implement the policy of dual transformation based on enterprises, it is recommended that the city and county establish a public-private relationship inspection committee or a public-private joint venture business improvement committee, led by the Party, absorbing representatives from both the public and private sides, as well as the Democratic National Construction Association, to be responsible for coordinating public-private relationships, inspecting the implementation of the enterprise's united front policy, mobilizing all positive factors of private personnel, and promoting transformation work. Second, provide appropriate care for private personnel in terms of life and welfare. It is hoped that the limit of 2,000 yuan will be appropriately raised to 5,000 yuan in terms of medical treatment for illness and sick leave wages.

Sun Fuling, Deputy Secretary-General of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, suggested that, without violating policies, when there are differences of opinion between the public and private sides, regardless of whether the factory director is from the public or private side, the opinion of the factory director should be followed.

He believes that Li Kangnian's suggestion of a fixed interest rate for twenty years is impossible to implement and should not be implemented.

Wang Dafu believes that the saying "ideological transformation has reached the top" is not in line with reality.

Wang Dafu of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce said in a written statement that since the overall public-private joint venture, the enthusiasm of the national bourgeoisie has continued to grow, and the negativity has continued to decrease, but the negative side still exists. The negative side is no longer illegal economic activities using the means of production, but mainly manifests in not being convinced of the leadership of the working class, worrying about gains and losses, only seeing themselves as "wealth," not seeing their own shortcomings, being arrogant and complacent, and relaxing transformation; some people are not satisfied with a fixed interest rate of seven years and want to extend it to twenty years; they do not have enough understanding of the superiority of socialist management methods, but are accustomed to the capitalist set; they compete for fame and gain, and they are not united in private. All these negativities, although gradually reduced under the constant education of the Party and the government, still arise from the nature of the national bourgeoisie. Therefore, denying negativity and thinking that the idea of "transformation to the top" is not in line with the facts. Even if classes are eliminated in the future, the remnants of bourgeois ideology will still exist for a long time, and ideological transformation must still be carried out under the leadership of the Party and the government.

Li Zhongyi issued a written opinion:
Opposing the argument that "the Federation of Industry and Commerce does not need a Party member Secretary-General"

Li Zhongyi, Director of the Organization Department of the Sichuan Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce, said in a written statement: The Party member Secretary-General or Deputy Secretary-General of the Federation of Industry and Commerce is elected or appointed by the Executive Committee. Party membership is his personal political identity, and his position is given to him by the Federation of Industry and Commerce, not by the Communist Party. His opinions and suggestions in the Federation of Industry and Commerce can only represent his personal opinions, not the opinions of the Communist Party. He should accept the leadership of the Chairman and Vice-Chairmen and abide by the regulations of the Federation of Industry and Commerce. Therefore, I believe that the Party member Secretary-General or Deputy Secretary-General should be in the position of staff in the Federation of Industry and Commerce, the same as other staff.

It is undeniable that some Party member Secretary-Generals seriously suffer from bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism, thinking of themselves as imperial envoys sent by the Communist Party to the Federation of Industry and Commerce, arrogant and complacent, dictatorial, and supreme in the Federation of Industry and Commerce. However, it should be pointed out that this is a shortcoming, and the Federation of Industry and Commerce should adopt criticism and education methods as it does for other staff, rather than adopting the "no need" method.

The shortcomings of Party member Secretary-Generals that are currently reflected: one is that they have not handled the relationship with the Chairman, Vice-Chairmen, and non-Party member Secretary-Generals well, that is, they have not done a good job in unity work; the other is that they take over and replace others in their work. I think that both sides are responsible for relationship problems. Generally speaking, if the relationship is not handled well, the Party member Secretary-General should bear more responsibility, but we should not therefore advocate "no Party member Secretary-General." Otherwise, assuming someone asks, "Among the staff or non-Party member Secretary-Generals of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, there are also those who have not handled the relationship well, and it has not been advocated 'no need.' Why is it advocated 'no need' if the Party member Secretary-General has not handled the relationship well?" As for taking over and replacing others, of course it is a shortcoming, but this is a shortcoming in doing work. Socialist transformation is a new work, and there is no mature experience, and shortcomings are inevitable in the work. Moreover, these shortcomings exist only in a few people, and some have already been corrected.

Therefore, I do not agree with the advocacy of some people that "the Federation of Industry and Commerce does not need a Party member Secretary-General."

He also cited several examples to show that Party member Secretary-Generals are welcome at the grassroots level.

In the fifteen counties of the Mianyang Special Zone in Sichuan, the secretaries of the Federations of Industry and Commerce are all Party members and Youth League members. Most of them have good relationships with the Chairman and Vice-Chairmen, and only one county is not so good. The Party member Secretary-Generals of the Chongqing and Yibin City Federations of Industry and Commerce also have very good relationships with the Chairman, Vice-Chairmen, and non-Party member Secretary-Generals. When the Party member Secretary-General of the Chongqing City Federation of Industry and Commerce was transferred away, the Chairman, Vice-Chairmen, and non-Party member Secretary-Generals all unanimously tried to retain him. There are also Party members who serve as Deputy Secretary-Generals in the Sichuan Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce. Over the past four years, he has had a good relationship with the Chairman, Vice-Chairmen, and non-Party member Secretary-Generals, respecting the opinions of the Chairman and Vice-Chairmen and respecting the powers of the non-Party member Secretary-Generals. Everything is handled through consultation. When the United Front Work Department asks the Federation of Industry and Commerce to study and arrange work, it also looks for the Chairman, Vice-Chairmen, and Secretary-General, and does not directly look for the Party member Secretary-General and bypass this level of leadership. Therefore, the relationship is good and the work is smooth.

Chen Binghuang, a private owner of Xing Noodle Restaurant on Zhoushan Road, Tilanqiao District, Shanghai, reflected in a written opinion that some small households have financial difficulties because they voluntarily reduced their salaries before the joint venture to overcome the difficulties of the enterprise, but their wages were not restored after the joint venture, and the fixed interest was also small. He requested the government to help solve the problem.

    合营企业里要不要公方代表？工商联里要不要党员秘书长？
    工商界在统战部召开的第九次座谈会上的发言
    温少鹤建议在公方领导下，实行行政集体领导
    重庆市工商联代理主任委员温少鹤在会上反映了重庆工商界对公私共事关系、思想改造、定息及加入工会等问题的意见。他并提出了下列几点建议：
      （一）在公方领导下，建立企业行政的集体领导，实行行政负责制。企业的政策方针由公方领导，公私双方的行政负责人按行政职务各负其责，做到有职、有权、有责。
      （二）中小户工商业者要求放弃定息的问题，只要条件成熟，应当个别的加以解决，并应责成合营企业的公方负责办理。资方代理人只要条件具备，也应该让他加入工会。
    最后，他要求工商联继续帮助工商业者进行思想改造，继续代表工商业者的合法利益，关心他们的工作、学习和生活，反映他们的意见和要求，帮助解决工作中生活中的困难。吴家荪认为：公方代表制度现在不能取消将来可以取消
    苏州市民建工商改造辅导处长吴家荪对在公私合营企业中是否需要公方代表制度的问题，发表了自己的看法。
    他认为，当前私方人员对社会主义改造，有很大的积极性，本身还有生产技术和经营管理的才能，一般都想搞好企业。但是还不能说他们已经完全没有资产阶级立场、观点、思想方法。有不少私方人员由于薪水已定，明哲保身，觉得多一事不如少一事，不求有功但求无过。有些人对社会主义事业，偶然还会出现怀疑和动摇态度。在这个思想状况下，他们是不能担负双重改造的领导责任的。
    合营企业要以社会主义原则作为改造企业、领导群众的根本方针，私方人员更缺乏这种能力。
    从当前客观条件来看，公方代表制度已受到全体工人阶级的拥护。合营后，工人热烈欢迎公方代表下厂，生产积极性空前提高，今天要取消公方代表制度，必须考虑这一方面情况。
    同时当前阶级之间的矛盾，虽然已经基本解决，但不等于说完全解决，工人对资产阶级长期以来所进行的残酷剥削的印象还很深。虽然工人阶级大公无私，从社会主义长远利益着眼，不念旧恶，但是阶级感情，不是马上就可以迅速转变的。在这一方面，还需要私方人员主动努力，通过工作积极缩短双方距离。我们不能忘记在合营前，企业中的主要矛盾就是劳资纠纷，今天所以劳资关系较好，相安无事，一方面固然由于生产资料所有制改变了，另一方面，也由于企业中有了公方代表，使公私关系掩盖了劳资关系。我们能否设想，取消了公方代表制度，就能保证劳私之间不会发生矛盾？发生矛盾的时候，再请政府仲裁，再请公方代表回厂，不是更麻烦？
    从以上情况来看，目前取消公方代表制度，对生产、对企业改造、对私方人员的改造都是不利的。公方代表制度是有利于双重改造的。现在的问题在于一方面提高公方代表的思想水平和能力，一方面在于发挥企业的集体领导，既发挥公方代表在企业中的领导作用，又能发挥私方人员社会主义积极性。因此，研究企业中集体领导制度倒是一个非常具体而切合实际的问题，也就是研究如何健全民主管理委员会，加强监督。
    现在不能撤出公方代表，那末将来是否可以呢？也就是将来是否可以让私方人员全部担当企业的领导责任呢？我认为是可以的，否则，就等于说和平改造不可能。如果将来不可能撤公方代表，那是执行政策有问题，即没有把私方人员思想改造好。私方人员改造到什么样程度才算好呢？我认为要具备以下三个条件：一、对社会主义有无限的坚定信心，在社会主义事业遇到困难的时候，不仅不动摇，而且协助党克服困难，这也就是在思想意识方面，对社会主义只有积极的一面，而没有消极的一面。二、与工人阶级有共同的思想、共同的语言，就是在企业里只有一种同志关系，没有阶级关系。三、具备按社会主义原则领导职工群众的能力。
    他说：提出取消公方代表制度，不单纯是消极性的表现
    吴家荪说：有些工商业者，甚至是积极分子，为什么提出现在取消公方代表制度呢？我认为这正是目前合营企业中公私关系不正常的反映。（如对私方信任不足，关心不够等）具体表现如下：
    这些人提出取消公方代表制度，本身就带有积极因素，即表示他们敢于担当企业中的生产经营责任。看不到这一点，在处理这个问题的时候，就会犯错误。有些关起门来研究问题的经济学家，是不能体会私方人员的苦衷的，因而认为是消极性的滋长，或者是私方人员的轻狂、夸大和不要社会主义等等。因此，在肯定当前不能取消公方代表制度的前提下，必须满足私方人员要求有职有权的合理要求，这样才有利于双重改造。
    最后，他建议：一、所有公方人员必须信任私方，让私方有职有权，消除一切人为障碍，充分给以工作上的条件，通过工作实践改造私方。今天指出公私合营企业中存在两重关系，为的不是要永远保存两重关系，而是更快消除两重关系。为了推动和督促公私双方贯彻以企业为基地进行双重改造的方针，建议市、县成立公私关系检查委员会，或者公私合营企业业务改进委员会，以党为领导，吸收公私双方代表以及民建会一起，负责协调公私关系，检查企业统战方针执行的情况，调动私方人员的一切积极因素，推动改造工作。二、在生活、福利等方面，对私方人员进行适当照顾。希望在疾病医疗、病假工资等方面适当由二千元的界限提高到五千元。
    全国工商联副秘书长孙孚凌建议，在不违背政策的原则下，公私双方意见有分歧时，不管正厂长是公方还是私方，都应听从正厂长的意见。
    他认为李康年提出定息二十年的建议是不可能实行，也不应该实行的。
    王达夫认为“思想改造到顶”的说法不符实际
    中华全国工商业联合会王达夫在书面发言中说，全行业公私合营以来，民族资产阶级的积极性不断增长，消极性不断减少，但消极一面仍然存在。消极的一面，已经不是利用生产资料在经济方面的不法活动，而主要是表现对工人阶级的领导不服气，患得患失，只看到自己是“财富”，看不到自己的缺点，骄傲自满，放松改造；有些人对定息七年还不满足，想要延长到二十年；对社会主义经营管理方法的优越性认识不足，而习惯于资本主义的一套；争名夺利，私私不团结。所有这些消极性，虽然在党和政府的不断教育之下，逐步减少，但仍然是从民族资产阶级的本性所产生的，因此，否认消极性，认为“改造到顶”的思想，是不符合事实的。即使将来阶级消灭了，资产阶级思想残余还会长期存在，还必须在党和政府的领导下进行思想改造。
    李忠义发表书面意见：
    反对“工商联不要党员秘书长”的主张
    四川省工商联组织部长李忠义在书面发言中说：工商联的党员秘书长或副秘书长，是由执行委员会选举或聘任的，党员是他个人的政治身份，他的职务是工商联给他的，不是共产党给他的，他在工商联的主张、建议，只能代表他个人的意见，不是代表共产党的意见，他应当接受主任委员和副主任委员的领导，遵守工商联的制度。因此，我认为党员秘书长或副秘书长在工商联应当是居于工作人员的地位，同其他工作人员是一样的。
    不可否认，有的党员秘书长严重地存在着官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义，自以为是共产党派到工商联来的钦差大臣，骄傲自满，独断专行，在工商联至高无上。但应当指出这是缺点，工商联应同对其他工作人员一样，采取批评教育的方式，而不应采取“不要”的办法。
    现在反映的党员秘书长的缺点：一种是没有把同主副委、非党员秘书长关系搞好，即是没有做好团结工作；一种是在工作中包办代替。我认为，凡是关系问题，两方面都有责任。一般来说，关系没有搞好，党员秘书长负的责任应当多些，但是，不能因此就主张“不要党员秘书长”了。否则，假定有人问，“工商联的工作人员或非党员秘书长中，也有把关系没有搞好的，未见主张‘不要’，党员秘书长没有把关系搞好，为什么就主张‘不要’呢？”至于包办代替，当然是缺点，但这是在做工作中的缺点。社会主义改造是新的工作，没有成熟的经验，在工作中难免不发生缺点。何况存在这些缺点的只是少数人，而且有的已改正了呢。
    因此，我不同意有人所主张的“工商联不要党员秘书长”。
    他还举了几个事例，说明党员秘书长在下面是受欢迎的。
    四川绵阳专区十五个县，工商联的秘书都是党员、团员，大多数同主副委的关系都搞得好，不大好的只有一个县。重庆市、宜宾市工商联的党员秘书长同主副委、非党员秘书长关系也搞得很好，重庆市工商联的党员秘书长调走时，主副委、非党员秘书长都曾一致挽留。四川省工商联也有党员任副秘书长的，四年来，他同主副委、非党员秘书长之间关系很好，尊重主副委的意见，尊重非党员秘书长的职权，一切事情协商办理，统战部找工商联研究、布置工作，也是找主副委同秘书长，并不直接找党员秘书长而迈过主副委这一层领导，因而，关系既搞得好，工作也很顺利。
    上海提篮桥区舟山路有兴面馆的私方陈炳煌在书面意见中，反映有些小户生活困难，原因是合营前，为了克服企业困难自动减了薪，合营后工薪没有恢复，定息又少。他要求政府帮助解决。
