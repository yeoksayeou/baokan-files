    Guangxi Export of Live Monkeys
    In the first quarter of this year, Guangxi transported and sold more than 1,000 golden monkeys to the Soviet Union. These monkeys are mainly exported as medical experimental products (using golden monkeys in the Soviet Union to experiment with treating polio has been very effective). In addition, some live monkeys from Guangxi are transported and sold to Hong Kong and Macau, but mostly for consumption.
    Vast mountainous areas and forests in southern China are rich in monkeys. Most of them belong to the Macaque family, such as the golden monkey (also known as the Rhesus monkey), the bear monkey (or black monkey, Assam macaque), the red-faced monkey, and the short-tailed monkey, which are widely distributed. The golden monkey has the highest yield.
    In some areas, monkeys have become a major agricultural pest, and farmers hate them.
    In the past, monkey prices were very low, and catching monkeys interfered with work, so farmers had little interest in catching them. Now, the government has opened up sales channels for monkeys (export), which not only solves the "monkey disaster" in agriculture, but also earns foreign exchange for the country by exporting live monkeys. For example, exporting fourteen golden monkeys can be exchanged for six tons of fertilizer; exporting one hundred and sixty-five monkeys can be exchanged for a six-ton truck. Many countries are currently asking China to supply live monkeys.
    It is understood that there is great potential in the quantity and variety of live monkeys that China can export. For example, currently the export of live monkeys is almost concentrated in Guangxi Province alone, and the varieties are limited to golden monkeys and bear monkeys. However, Fujian, Sichuan, Yunnan, Hubei and other mountainous areas also produce monkeys. It is hoped that farmers in these areas will vigorously catch monkeys and strive to exchange them for more industrial construction equipment. ·Yú Duòfū·

    广西活猴出口
    今年第一季度，广西运销苏联的金丝猴有一千多头，这些猴主要是作为医疗试验品出口（在苏联利用金丝猴试验医治小儿麻痹症很有成效）；此外，广西活猴还有一部分运销香港、澳门，但多供食用。
    我国南方广大山区和森林地带都盛产猴子。其中多属弥猴科，如金丝猴（又名恒河猴），熊猴（或黑猴、阿萨密猴），红面猴和短尾猴分布较广。产量则以金丝猴最多。
    猴子在某些地区已成为农业生产的主要害兽，农民恨之入骨。
    过去，猴价很低，捕猴误工，以致农民捕捉的兴趣不大。现在，政府打开了猴子销路（出口），不仅解决了农业上的“猴灾”，而且出口活猴还可为国家换回外汇。例如：出口十四只金丝猴，可换六吨肥田粉；出口一百六十五只猴可换一部载重六吨的汽车。目前已有许多国家要求我国供应活猴。
    据了解，我国活猴可能出口的数量和品种有很大的潜力。譬如，目前活猴出口几乎集中广西一省，品种也仅限于金丝猴和熊猴两种。而福建、四川、云南、湖北山区等地都产猴子。希望这些地区的农民大力捕猴，争取换回更多的工业建设器材。　　　　　·于舵夫·
