Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, May 23rd: Zhejiang Province Governor Sha Wenhan yesterday invited non-Party members of the Provincial People's Committee to a discussion on how to fully utilize the role of the Provincial People's Congress and the Provincial People's Committee.

　　Committee member Tang Xunze suggested at the meeting the establishment of a standing committee of the Provincial People's Congress, to represent the Provincial People's Congress during the adjournment of the congress to support and supervise the Provincial People's Committee, so that the government's work can be more comprehensive and correct.

　　Committee member Wu Shanmin advocated changing the current method of inspection by people's representatives. He said that many grassroots cadres and the masses have great concerns when reporting situations, and often have two different sets of words for what they report to leading cadres and what they say in private. Therefore, inspections carried out with great fanfare like the current ones may not necessarily obtain the true situation.

　　Many committee members mentioned in their speeches that, apart from attending the monthly meetings of the Provincial People's Committee, they have almost nothing else to do. Because they rarely gather to understand the actual work, and only receive notification the day before the meeting, even the attached documents cannot be studied in time, making it very difficult to offer opinions.

　　Committee member Jiang Zhenzhong believes that the reason why the Provincial People's Congress representatives and Provincial People's Committee members cannot fully play their role at present is mainly because they are not given enough importance in various aspects. They have a sense of responsibility, but often have no way to fulfill it. Jiang Zhenzhong said that to solve this problem, on the one hand, it is necessary to frequently publicize the role of people's representatives and government committee members to the masses, and all departments have the responsibility to reflect situations and answer questions to them. On the other hand, they should also be given the power to dare to criticize the government's work, and at the same time, they should be provided with the necessary information to understand various tasks.

    如何充分发挥省人民代表大会和人民委员会的作用
    浙江省人民委员会非党委员举行座谈
    新华社杭州23日电　浙江省省长沙文汉昨天邀请省人民委员会委员中的非党人士座谈怎样充分发挥省人民代表大会和省人民委员会的作用。
    唐巽泽委员在会上建议成立省级人民代表大会的常务委员会，在大会闭幕期间代表省人民代表大会支持省人民委员会并进行监督，使政府工作能更加全面和正确。
    吴山民委员主张改变目前人民代表的视察办法。他说，不少基层干部和群众反映情况有很大顾虑，对领导干部汇报的和平时谈的往往是两套。因此，像现在这样大张旗鼓地下去视察不一定能得到真实情况。
    不少委员在发言中提到，这几年除了参加每月一次的省人民委员会会议以外，几乎无事可做。由于平时很少集会了解实际工作，开会前一天才接到通知，连附发的文件也来不及研究，实在很难提意见。
    姜震中委员认为，省人民代表大会代表和省人民委员会委员目前所以不能充分发挥作用，主要是由于各个方面对他们还不够重视。他们有责任感，但往往无从尽责。姜震中说，要解决这个问题，一方面要经常向群众宣传人民代表和政府委员的作用，各个部门有责任向他们反映情况回答问题，另一方面还要给他们以权力，使他们敢于对政府的各项工作提出批评，同时还要供给他们以了解各项工作必需的资料。
