It is not factual to say "farmers live a hard life" in general; emphasizing that rural cadres are "a mess" is not fair enough.
Jia Yibin
    I have recently inspected six agricultural cooperatives, some of which belong to the suburban areas of Shanghai, and most of which are in other provinces and regions. I would like to make a brief report to the conference on the situation and problems I have seen for discussion and reference.
    Of the six cooperatives I have seen, three are doing well, two are average, and one is poor (this one is a grain-deficient cooperative that has suffered severe natural disasters).
    Looking at a newly established cooperative that is doing well, with a total of 240 households, 200 households increased their income last year compared to before the cooperative, accounting for about 83.3%; about the same as before were 22 households, accounting for 9.2%; and 18 households had reduced income, accounting for 7.5% (mainly due to more land and a shortage of labor). At the end of the year's distribution, in addition to retaining seeds, rations, and other four retentions, some of the strongest laborers received 200 yuan, and generally received more than 100 yuan. A poor peasant named Jia Yongyou, who used to rely on relief for a long time, has undergone a great change since joining the cooperative, and also received more than 100 yuan, so happy that he almost jumped up. He said: He had never seen a five-yuan bill in his life, and this time he not only saw it but also got it. Last year, during the Spring Festival, more than half of the people in this cooperative made new clothes, and each person could buy three and a half jin of pork. Therefore, some farmers happily sang: "Chairman Mao leads the cooperativization, no longer eating sweet potato flour all year round; don't be afraid of eating, drinking, and wearing, work hard to produce and support industrialization." Others said: "Land reform turned us over, cooperativization rooted us in wealth." This is a cooperative that is doing well. The average cooperatives generally have food to eat, clothes to keep warm, and their lives have been improved to some extent, and most of them have implemented "five guarantees," and the widowed, orphaned, and lonely have been taken care of. What about the disaster-stricken cooperative? It is indeed much more difficult than those few cooperatives, and many rely on relief to survive. However, the farmers also understand the benefits of cooperativization in resisting natural disasters, and basically no phenomena such as fleeing famine, begging, or theft have occurred. Some farmers said with emotion: "If it weren't for the cooperative, half of the cattle would have died and half would have been sold, and half of the people would have fled." The general reflection is: "With cooperativization, we are not afraid of anything." Based on the above facts, some people say in general that "farmers live a hard life." In my opinion, the lives of farmers, generally speaking, are not only better than before liberation and after land reform, but also better than before cooperativization.
    I saw that only one household in these six cooperatives had ever made trouble about withdrawing from the cooperative. This household had a lower income than before and had requested to withdraw from the cooperative and work independently for some time, but then asked to rejoin the cooperative on its own. The saying that farmers are clamoring to withdraw from the cooperative is not consistent with the facts I have seen.
    I have also interviewed members of these cooperatives individually, especially the well-to-do middle peasants. I asked them if they joined the cooperative voluntarily at the beginning? They all said they were voluntary. One person's willingness is not enough; the whole family must agree. A well-to-do middle peasant said to me: I applied three times before I was approved. Therefore, some people say that farmers' participation in the cooperative is completely forced by cadres. In my opinion, this may be some individual phenomenon, not the mainstream of this cooperativization.
    Here, I would also like to talk about the work of rural cadres. The vast majority of them work diligently and conscientiously. Some participate in labor during the day and have meetings at night. Although their cultural level is lower, they are all striving to learn the management of cooperatives. Their prestige among the masses is generally still high. However, some people one-sidedly emphasize the deviations of the cadres, believing that the cadres are "a mess." This is not consistent with the facts and is not fair enough.
    As for whether the few cooperatives I have seen are completely consolidated and have no problems? No, I can't say that. There are still the following main problems: First, the issue of running cooperatives thriftily. Some members have better incomes and think that after joining the cooperative, they don't have to worry about food and clothing, so they pay attention to eating and drinking, and dressing; some want to build new houses on a large scale; and some even prepare clothes for very young children to get married, which requires strengthening education on running cooperatives thriftily. The second is the issue of running cooperatives democratically. Some cadres still have a lower cultural level, their work style is also relatively rigid, and they simplify the handling of problems, and members have some opinions, which also needs to be gradually resolved through this party rectification. Third, the management of cooperatives is a very meticulous and complex task. We still lack experience, so that the scoring is sometimes wrong, the calculation is also slow, and the accounts cannot be published in a timely manner, which also makes members have opinions about the cooperative cadres, which requires mobilizing intellectuals to go to the countryside to participate in cooperative work. Finally, I would also like to talk about a specific issue, which is also the most prominent issue at present, that is, the general feeling of fertilizer shortage. If this problem is not solved, it will not only be difficult to increase agricultural production, but also cause disunity within the cooperative, such as some people using more fertilizer on their private plots. This also requires our cities to find more ways to support. I firmly believe that the victorious Chinese people will be able to solve these problems victoriously under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. What I have seen is very superficial and not comprehensive enough. Please criticize and correct me at the conference.

### 笼统地说“农民生活苦”不合事实  强调农村干部“一团糟”不够公平

    笼统地说“农民生活苦”不合事实
    强调农村干部“一团糟”不够公平
    贾亦斌
    我最近视察了六个农业合作社，其中一部分属于上海市郊区；大部分是在其他省区。兹将我所看到的情况和问题向大会作一简要的报告，以供讨论的参考。
    从我所看到的六个合作社中，三个合作社是办得较好的，二个是一般的，一个是较差的（这一个社是缺粮社，是受过严重自然灾害的）。
    从一个办得较好的新建一社来看，计共有二百四十户，去年比合作化以前增加收入的计有二百户，约占83.3％；和从前差不多的计有二十二户，占9.2％；收入减少的计有十八户，占7.5％（这主要是田地较多，劳动力缺少的）。到年终分配的时候，除留种子、留口粮等四留以外，有的劳动力最强的户分到了二百元，一般分到一百多元。有一个贫农贾永有，过去长期是靠救济过日子的，自参加合作社以后情况大变了，也分到了一百多元，高兴得几乎跳起来了。他说：一生没有见到过五块钱的票子，这次不仅看到而且拿到了。去年过年的时候，这个社有一大半以上的人都做了新衣裳，每人还可以购买三斤半猪肉。所以有的农民高兴的唱着：“毛主席领导合作化，再不常年吃粉渣；吃喝穿戴全不怕，努力生产支援工业化。”还有说：“土改翻了身，合作化扎富根。”这是办得好的合作社。一般的社一般地已有饭可吃，有衣可以御寒，生活已有所改善，并且大都实行了“五保”，鳏寡孤独得到了照顾。还有那一个受灾的合作社情况怎样呢？它的确是比那几个合作社艰苦得多，很多是靠救济过日子。但农民也懂得合作化以后对于抵抗自然灾害的好处，基本上做到没有发生逃荒、要饭、盗窃等现象，有的农民感动地说：“要不是合作社，牛得死一半，卖一半，人得逃荒走一半。”普遍反映：“有了合作化，什么都不怕。”根据以上事实，有些人笼统地说“农民生活苦”，依我看，农民生活一般来说，不仅比解放以前和土改之后好，而且比合作化以前也要好些。
    我看到这六个合作社中只有一户曾闹过退社的，这一户是收入较前减少，曾要求退社而单干一些时自己又请求重新加入了社。有些人说农民纷纷要求退社的说法，是不符合我所看到的事实的。
    我也个别访问过这几个社里的社员，特别是其中的富裕中农，我问他们当初入社是否出于自愿？他们都说是自愿的。一个人自愿还不行，还得全家同意。一个富裕中农对我说：我要求三次，才得到批准。所以有人说，农民参加合作社是完全被干部强迫的，依我看，这可能是某些个别的现象，不是这次合作化的主流。
    这里我还想谈谈农村干部的工作情况，他们绝大多数人是勤勤恳恳地工作的，有的白天参加劳动，夜里还要开会，文化虽然低些，还都在努力学习合作社里的经营管理。在群众中的威信，一般也还是高的。有些人却片面强调干部的偏差，认为干部“一团糟”，这是不符合事实的，也是不够公平的。
    至于说我所看到的那几个合作社是否已经完全巩固，没有什么问题呢？不，不能那样说，它还存在以下几个主要问题：第一是勤俭办社的问题，有些社员收入较好，以为加入合作社以后衣食不愁了，就有些讲吃喝，讲穿着；有的想大兴土木造新房子；还有个别的把很小的孩子结婚的衣服都准备起来，这就需要加强勤俭办社的教育。第二是民主办社的问题，还有些干部文化水平较低，工作作风也较生硬，处理问题简单化，社员是有些意见的，这也需要通过这次全党整风来逐步解决。第三，合作社经营管理是一个很细致复杂的工作，我们还缺乏经验，以致记分有时弄错，计算也较迟慢，公布帐目不能及时，这也使社员对社干有意见，这就需要动员知识分子下乡参加合作社工作。最后还想谈一个具体问题，也是目前最突出的问题，就是普遍感到肥料的缺乏。这个问题不解决，不仅不易使农业增产，而且社内会产生不团结的现象，如有些人把肥料多用在自留地上去。这也需要我们城市多多设法支援的。我坚决相信胜利的中国人民，一定能在中国共产党和毛主席领导下，胜利地解决这些问题的，所见非常肤浅，也很不全面，请大会批评指正。
