Unreasonable Bonuses of All Kinds

The discussion of whether enterprise leaders should receive bonuses is certainly important; but an even more worthwhile question to explore is how enterprise leaders implement the reward policy.

"Lazy Bonus"

Last year, the state-owned Dongshan Coal Mine in Shanxi Province implemented a new coal mining method in some back mining working faces. Because the workers were not skilled, they had been unable to complete the production tasks. At this time, the key to the problem lay in helping the workers to improve their skills and in organizing the cooperation between the three shifts. However, the leading cadres did not start from here, but hastily established a cycle award. The cycle award was ineffective, so it was changed to a reward as long as the task was completed. As a result, one shift occasionally completed the task and received a bonus, but when the output of the three shifts was added together, it still did not meet the planned requirements.

For problems that should have been solved with concrete measures, enterprise leaders were unwilling to put in the effort and instead resorted to establishing various rewards, which proved ineffective despite the use of bonuses. Many of the numerous rewards in factories are created in this way.

"Emotion Bonus"

In the early days of liberation, the Qinghua workshop of the Jinsheng Textile Factory in Taiyuan City often caught fire due to impurities in the raw cotton that were sent into the machines. An accident-free award was established, stipulating that if there were no accidents for half a year, workers could receive bonuses accounting for 15% of the total wages of all workers in the workshop. This bonus played a significant role. However, in the previous year and the year before last, due to the increased sense of responsibility of the workers and the fact that farmers delivered raw cotton with very few impurities, accidents had been basically eliminated. At this time, factory leaders still did not abolish this reward, arguing that abolishing it would affect the workers' enthusiasm. Thus, this accident-free bonus, which was designed to cater to the workers' emotions, has been preserved until now.

"One-Sided Bonus"

This kind of bonus was also born in the Jinsheng Textile Factory. The sock weaving section of this factory has a reward for saving needles. Everyone actively saves needles, and they are unwilling to replace broken needles with new ones, resulting in the weaving of some broken socks with holes, but the bonuses are still received as usual. There are similar situations in the dyeing and bleaching section. The amount of dyes and bleaching powder used is reduced compared with the national regulations, but the quality of the products declines, yet the savings bonuses are still issued.

"Savings Bonus"

The Xinjiang Textile Factory in Shanxi Province has a regulation: all those who save leather roller flowers will be given a savings bonus according to 2% of the worker's wages. Once, the amount of fine yarn leather roller flowers used was 3.75 pounds lower than the quota. At the then price, these three pounds of leather roller flowers were only worth 2.8 yuan. However, the bonus totaled 64.69 yuan, which was dozens of times greater than the value of the savings!

In August last year, forty winemakers at the Taiyuan Winery saved grain worth 1,042 yuan, but received a bonus of 1,040 yuan. It turned out that the workers' technical level had improved, and the state-stipulated grain consumption had been revised. However, the bonus was still calculated according to the old quota, resulting in almost all the money saved being issued as a bonus.

Duplicated Bonuses

In some factories and mines, the labor competition award, the team economic accounting award, and the raw material saving award contain a common requirement: to save raw materials and reduce costs. If a certain production unit reduces costs, the money saved for the country may only be one figure, but it can receive three kinds of bonuses. The tunneling second team of the Dongshan Coal Mine received this kind of duplicated bonus of more than 400 yuan last December, accounting for more than 61% of the team's total piece-rate wages. A factory laboratory, because the staff sometimes made mistakes in the experiment or in the record, the laboratory director decided to establish a bonus to stimulate everyone to prevent errors. This leader said without shame: Our factory has reward measures for all kinds of work, but we are the only ones who do not. Are everyone willing to work actively?

Where is the Problem?

What is the root cause of these unreasonable bonuses?

Many enterprise leaders think that bonuses can solve all problems, and that is the crux of the problem. Under the guidance of this wrong idea, although a lot of money is spent, the result is not only that the old problems are not solved, but also a series of new problems are caused. The situation that some employees are unwilling to work actively without bonuses has occurred, and unhealthy tendencies have also developed.

Helping enterprise leaders understand the purpose of rewards, and then adopting or discarding previous reward methods and formulating new reward systems according to this purpose, and conducting in-depth ideological work in conjunction with rewards, is the way out to solve the bonus problem.

Prevent Two Deviations

Recently, some enterprises have blindly negated everything without analysis, and have also cancelled some necessary reward systems. For example, a coal mine cancelled the pit wood saving award, and a factory in Beijing stopped all eleven reward systems in the factory. I think this practice is inappropriate.

I believe that in rectifying the reward wage system, we must not only oppose the blind establishment of numerous reward systems, but also prevent the blind cancellation of some indispensable rewards. We must not overemphasize the role of material encouragement, and therefore relax political and ideological education; nor can we think that with political and ideological work, we can do without material encouragement. I believe that the establishment or cancellation of any reward system, as long as it deviates from the requirements of increasing production and practicing economy and improving quality, and deviates from the needs of production, is wrong.

At present, there are indeed many problems with the reward wage system of enterprises, but it must be comprehensively analyzed and studied. Some that have practical effects on increasing production and practicing economy must be preserved and adhered to; some that have a role in increasing production and practicing economy, but the system itself has shortcomings, such as lagging reward indicators or the lack of connection between reward indicators and award conditions, and the unreasonable stipulation of reward rates, should be actively improved; those that have no practical significance for increasing production and practicing economy should be gradually cancelled; at the same time, in enterprises where there are few or no reward systems at all, it can also be considered to establish reward systems that meet the needs of production and have economic effects within the scope of the wage plan approved by the state according to the requirements of increasing production and practicing economy. Whether establishing or improving any reward system, it must be repeatedly explained to the employees. In particular, cancelling a reward system should be more cautious, and should be fully deliberated among the masses to obtain their support. Chen Zhengming

### 企业里哪些奖金不合理？  怎样对待不合理的奖金？

    企业里哪些奖金不合理？  怎样对待不合理的奖金？
    不合理奖金种种
    讨论企业领导干部应不应该得奖，固然十分重要；但更值得探讨的问题，却是企业领导干部怎样执行奖励政策。
   “偷　懒　奖”
    去年，山西省地方国营东山煤矿在部分回采工作面实行新采煤法。由于工人不熟练，一直完不成生产任务。这时，问题的关键在于帮助工人提高技术，组织好三班之间的配合。可是领导干部不从这里下手，而是急急忙忙地建立循环奖。循环奖无效，又改成只要完成任务就得奖。结果偶尔一个班完成了任务，发了奖金，但是把三个班的产量加起来，还是达不到计划要求。
    这种本来应该采取具体措施才能解决的问题，企业领导干部却不肯花费心思，而动不动就建立这样那样的奖励，结果用了奖金仍然无效。许多工厂里名目繁多的奖励中，有一部分正是这样产生的。
   “情　绪　奖”
    解放初期，太原市晋生纺织厂清花车间由于原棉里有杂质，送到机器里，常常引起火灾，曾建立了一种无事故奖，规定如果半年无事故，工人可得占全车间工人工资总额15％的奖金。这种奖金曾起了很大的作用。但是，到了前年和去年，由于工人的责任心提高了，农民交售的原棉也很少有杂质了，事故已基本消灭。这时，工厂领导人员仍然不取消这种奖励，理由是取消了会影响工人的积极性。于是，这种为了照顾工人情绪的无事故奖金，一直还保存到现在。
   “片面奖”
    这种奖也诞生在晋生纺织厂。这个厂的织袜工段有一种节约用针奖励。大家积极地节约用针，针坏了也不肯换新的，结果织出一些有窟窿的破袜子，奖金还是照领。在漂染工段也有类似情形。染料和漂白粉用量比国家规定用量减少了，产品质量却下降了，可是节约奖金照发。
    “节约奖”
    山西省新绛纺织厂有一条规定：凡是节约了皮辊花，即按照工人工资的2％发给节约奖金。一次，细纱皮辊花用量比定额降低了三点七五磅，按当时的价格，这三磅多皮辊花只值二元八角。可是，奖金一共发了六十四元六角九分，比节约价值大了数十倍！
    去年8月，太原酒厂四十名酒工节约了价值一千零四十二元的粮食，却得了一千零四十元奖金。原来工人的技术水平提高了，国家规定的粮食消耗量已经修改了，奖金却仍然按旧定额计算，结果把节约的钱几乎都发了奖。
    重复奖
    在某些厂矿里，劳动竞赛奖、班组经济核算奖、节约原材料奖等三种奖励，包含一个共同的要求：节约原材料降低成本。如果某个生产单位降低了成本，为国家节约的钱虽然只有一个数字，却可以领到三种奖金。东山煤矿掘进二队在去年12月得了这种重复的奖金四百多元，占这个队计件工资总额的61％以上。有一个工厂的试验室，因为工作人员有时试验错了或是纪录错了，试验室主任就决定建立一种奖金来刺激大家防止错误。这位领导人员毫不害羞地说：我们厂无论什么工种都有奖励办法，惟独我们没有，大家肯积极工作吗？
    问题在哪里？
    产生这些不合理奖金的根本原因在哪里呢？
    不少企业领导干部以为有了奖金就可以解决一切问题，这就是问题的症结所在。在这种错误思想的指导下，虽然费了大量金钱，但结果不仅没有解决老问题，反而惹出了一系列的新问题，有的职工没有奖金便不肯积极劳动的情形发生了，不良倾向也发展了。
    帮助企业领导干部认识奖励的目的，然后根据这个目的来取舍以往的奖励办法，制订新的奖励制度，并且结合奖励进行深入的思想工作，这就是解决奖金问题的出路。
                  顾页
    要防止两种偏向
    最近，有些企业不加分析地盲目否定一切，把一些必要的奖励制度也取消了。例如，有一个煤矿把节约坑木奖取消了，北京有一个厂把全厂十一种奖励制度全部停止了。我认为这种做法是不恰当的。
    我认为，在整顿奖励工资制度的时候，既要反对盲目建立名目繁多的奖励制度，也要防止盲目取消必不可少的一些奖励。既不能过分强调物质鼓励的作用，因而放松了政治思想教育工作；也不能认为有了政治思想工作，就可以不要物质鼓励了。我认为，任何奖励制度的建立或取消，只要离开了增产节约，提高质量的要求，离开了生产需要，都是不对的。
    目前企业的奖励工资制度确实存在不少问题，但是必须全面地分析研究，有些对增产节约有实际效果的，必须保存和坚持；有些对增产节约虽然有作用，但制度本身存在缺点，如奖励指标落后或奖励指标与得奖条件互不联系，奖励率规定得不合理等，应该积极地改进；对于增产节约没有实际意义的，应该逐步取消；同时，在很少有和根本没有奖励制度的企业中，还可以考虑根据增产节约的要求，在国家批准的工资计划范围内，建立符合生产需要而且有经济效果的奖励制度。无论建立和改进任何一种奖励制度，都必须反复地向职工交代清楚。特别是取消一种奖励制度更要慎重，要在群众中充分酝酿，取得群众的支持。　陈正明
