Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, May 21st - According to a report by the Polish Press Agency on the 20th, the Ninth Plenary Session of the Polish United Workers' Party Central Committee passed a resolution on the Party's responsibility for the deviations of the former Ministry of Public Security agencies from 1949 to 1955.

The resolution stated that the committee established by the Eighth Plenary Session to investigate this issue found that former Politburo member Berman and former Politburo member and former Minister of Public Security Radkiewicz did not fulfill their Party responsibilities in supervising and leading the work of public security agencies at the time.

The Central Committee decided to expel both of them from the Central Committee, expel them from the Party, and remove them from the government. They can reapply for Party membership after three years.

The Central Committee believes that the organizational measures taken against former Deputy Minister of Public Security Mitkowski when he was expelled from the Central Committee were insufficient. Therefore, it decided to expel him from the Party.

    关于党对前公安部的偏差应负责任的决议
    新华社华沙21日电　据波兰通讯社20日报道，波兰统一工人党九中全会通过了一项关于党对前公安部各机构从1949年到1955年间的偏差应负的责任的决议。
    决议说，八中全会成立的调查这个问题的委员会查明，前政治局委员贝尔曼和前政治局委员、前公安部长拉德凯维奇当时在监督和领导公安机构的工作方面没有履行他们所负的党的责任。
    中央委员会决定把他们两人开除出中央委员会，开除出党，并且革出政府。三年后，他们可以重新申请入党。
    中央委员会认为，以前在前公安部副部长米特科夫斯基被开除出中央委员会的时候，对他所采取的组织上措施是不够的，因此，决定把他开除出党。
