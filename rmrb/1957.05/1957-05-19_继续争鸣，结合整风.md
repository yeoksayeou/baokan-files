Continue Contention, Combine with Rectification

Recently, discussions have been widely held across the country regarding Chairman Mao's speech at the Supreme State Conference on the correct handling of contradictions among the people. Individuals from various democratic parties and figures in science, culture, art, education, and other fields have continuously held symposiums. People speaking at various meetings have been enthusiastic, boldly exposing many contradictions in their regions and departments, and offering sharp criticisms of the central and local leading organs, cadres, and party members. This is an active and direct help to our Party's rectification movement. This will undoubtedly have a significant impact on our country's socialist construction.

The experiences in Beijing, Shanghai, and other places have shown that only by exposing the various contradictions among the people can our Party's rectification movement proceed more smoothly. At the same time, only by carrying out a rectification movement within the Party can we better handle contradictions among the people. That is to say, we must allow all parties to continue to contend and combine it with rectification; that is, to combine the rectification movement with the correct handling of contradictions among the people, and earnestly realize what the Party Central Committee's instructions on the rectification movement say: "Take the correct handling of contradictions among the people as the theme of the current rectification." And for this purpose, we must first fully expose the various contradictions among the people. This requires letting all kinds of different opinions from all aspects be expressed, so that everyone can speak frankly and sincerely. This is the true realization of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," while also helping our Party's rectification movement.

In these days, the criticisms of our Party and state work by non-Party members, no matter how sharp, are basically sincere, and the vast majority of opinions are correct and beneficial. As long as the leading organs and leading comrades of various departments and localities are good at accepting all useful criticisms, seriously study the opinions put forward by all parties, and earnestly correct the shortcomings and errors in their work, they will certainly be able to achieve the goal of filling and dismantling the deep ditches and high walls between the Party and non-Party members, strengthening the unity among the people, and greatly improving their work. Recently, some places have begun to do so, and good results have already occurred.

However, there are still some comrades who are not quite clear about the Party's conducting rectification while "contending" with non-Party members, and about non-Party members helping us in rectification. When they hear various opinions being expressed freely and boldly, and some opinions are directed at themselves, they feel uneasy in their minds, feel that they are in imminent danger of collapse, and believe that this "puts the leadership in a passive position." We might as well calmly think about whether this phenomenon is good or bad. Being "passive" is naturally not good; but is it better to be a little passive now to avoid being greatly passive in the future? Is it better to continue to let go boldly and let everyone express themselves freely and boldly, or is it better to be restrained—restraining both oneself and everyone else? We are in favor of the former. Contradictions already exist, and not resolving them will only deepen them; covering them up cannot cover them up, just as paper cannot contain fire.

In fact, the main contradictions exposed by non-Party members at present are basically consistent with the problems that our Party's rectification movement wants to solve. How should these problems be solved? This cannot be solved by closing the door and relying solely on our Party members to come up with solutions. This requires the joint efforts of non-Party members and ourselves. We should not adopt the method of closed-door rectification, but should adopt the method of open-door rectification, humbly and earnestly listening to the opinions of non-Party members. Recently, it is precisely because of the free and bold expression of non-Party members that we have become more aware of the bureaucratic, sectarian, and subjectivist errors committed by many leading organs and leading personnel in their work. Some of them are shocking. This will of course only be beneficial to our rectification and improvement of work, and will not be harmful.

From the perspective of the masses, continuing contention and combining it with rectification will further improve their understanding of the Communist Party and Marxism. Now, people are criticizing errors and shortcomings in their work, and criticizing subjectivism, especially dogmatism. People's understanding of the Communist Party and Marxism is constantly improving. Here, we should fully believe in the discernment of the masses, and should not underestimate it. In the long years before the Chinese people's revolution achieved nationwide victory, Marxism was only a spark. However, from the first day it was transmitted to China, it gained more and more masses day by day. Despite its enemies repeatedly declaring it illegal, a scourge, it still took root and developed. Progressive people broke through persecution and even risked their lives to approach the Communist Party and Marxism. This proves that the people have always been in pursuit of truth. Our task is precisely to help the masses distinguish between truth and falsehood, beauty and ugliness, and good and evil; and to let the true, the good, and the beautiful triumph over the false, the evil, and the ugly.

Through this contention and rectification, we want to make the ideological outlook inside and outside the Party completely new. Our country's Marxist ideology will develop healthily in the combat training, and socialist, national new science and new culture will gradually form on this basis. This is in line with the development law of the ideological part of the superstructure. The emergence and development of Marxism prove that, on the one hand, it absorbs a large amount of nourishment from the treasure house of human civilization, forming a new ideological system and revolutionary theory, and then returns to guide practice; on the other hand, it constantly struggles with all erroneous and even reactionary ideas. Its history of development is a history of struggle. The infinite vitality of Marxism lies precisely in the fact that it is never stagnant. It will not only not fall in the face of hostile ideas, but will only grow stronger.

We hope that in the process of continuing contention and combining it with rectification, the opinions inside and outside the Party can be further communicated, so that they can confide in each other and be close to each other. The leaders of various localities, departments, and units should continue to encourage people to contend boldly, cooperate with our Party's rectification, expose and correct shortcomings and errors in their work at any time, and handle contradictions among the people at any time.

### 继续争鸣，结合整风

    继续争鸣，结合整风
    近来全国各地普遍讨论了毛主席在最高国务会议上关于正确地处理人民内部矛盾问题的讲话，各民主党派人士和科学、文化、艺术、教育等各界人士连续举行了座谈会。在各种会议上发言的人们都很踊跃，大胆地揭露了本地区、本部门的许多矛盾，对中央和地方的领导机关、干部、党员提出了许多尖锐的批评。这对于我们党的整风运动是一个积极的直接的帮助。这对于我国的社会主义建设事业无疑地将发生重大的影响。
    北京、上海等地已有的经验表明，只有把人民内部的各种矛盾揭露出来，才能够使我们党的整风运动进行得更加顺利；同时，也只有在党内开展整风运动，才能更好地处理人民内部的矛盾。这就是说，我们要让各方面继续争鸣，结合整风；就是把整风运动和正确地处理人民内部的矛盾问题互相结合，认真地实现党中央关于整风运动的指示中所说的“把正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题作为当前整风的主题。”而为了这个目的，我们首先要充分地揭露人民内部的各种矛盾，这就应该让各个方面人们的各种不同的意见都讲出来，大家推心置腹，畅所欲言。这样才算真正地实现了“百家争鸣”，同时帮助了我们党的整风运动。
    在这些日子里，党外人士对于我们的党和国家工作的批评，不管如何尖锐，基本上是诚恳的，绝大多数意见是正确的、有益处的。只要各部门、各地方的领导机关和领导同志，善于接受一切有益的批评，认真研究各方面所提的意见，切实纠正工作中的缺点和错误，就一定可以达到填平和拆除党内外之间的深沟高墙、加强人民内部的团结和大大改进工作的目的。近来，有的地方开始这样做了，已经发生良好的效果。
    但是，也还有一些同志对于党在党外“争鸣”的同时进行整风，并且要党外人士帮助我们整风，思想上还有点搞不通。他们听到各种意见大放大鸣，并且有的意见是针对着自己的，于是在思想上就放不开，觉得岌岌不可终日，认为这样就“使领导陷于被动”了。我们不妨冷静地想一想，这种现象，究竟是好还是不好？“被动”，自然不妙；可是，还是现在小被动以免将来大被动好些呢？是继续大胆放手，让大家大放大鸣好些呢？还是束手束脚——既束住自己也束住大家——好些呢？我们是赞成前者的。矛盾既已存在，不解决，只会加深；掩盖是掩盖不了的，正如纸包不住火一样。
    其实，目前党外人士揭露的主要的矛盾问题，同我们党的整风运动所要解决的问题，基本上是一致的。这些问题如何解决呢？这决不是关起门来，仅仅依靠我们党内同志自己想出办法就能够解决的。这是要依靠党外人士和我们共同努力才能解决的。我们不应该采取关门整风的办法，而要采取开门整风的办法，虚心地认真地倾听党外人士的意见。近来正是由于党外人士大放大鸣的结果，才使我们更加认识了许多领导机关和领导人员在工作中所犯的官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义的错误。其中有的是令人触目惊心的。这对于我们的整风和改进工作当然只会有好处，而不会有坏处。
    从群众方面来说，继续争鸣、结合整风也将进一步提高他们对共产党和马克思主义的认识水平。现在，人们都在批评工作中的错误和缺点，批判主观主义特别是教条主义。人们对于共产党和马克思主义的认识正在不断地提高。在这里，我们应该充分地相信群众的鉴别力，不能把群众的鉴别力估计得太低了。在中国人民革命取得全国性胜利以前的漫长年代里，马克思主义还只是星星之火。然而从它传到中国的第一天起，就一天比一天掌握了更多的群众。尽管它的敌人屡次宣布它为非法，为洪水猛兽，但它还是生根而且发展了。进步的群众冲破迫害甚至冒着生命危险，要接近共产党，接近马克思主义。这就可以证明，人民群众从来就是追求真理的。我们的任务，正是要去帮助群众辨别真伪、美丑和善恶；并且要让真的东西、善的东西、美的东西战胜假的东西、恶的东西、丑的东西。
    经过这一次争鸣和整风，我们要使党内外的思想面貌焕然一新。我国的马克思主义思想将在战斗的锻炼中健康地发展，社会主义的、民族的新科学、新文化将在这个基础上逐渐形成。这是符合于社会上层建筑的意识形态部分的发展规律的。马克思主义的产生和发展证明：它一方面从人类文明的宝库中大量地不断地吸收养料，构成了新的思想体系和革命学说，再回过来指导实际；另一方面又不断地同一切错误的以至反动的思想作斗争。它的发展的历史，就是一部斗争的历史。马克思主义的无限生命力，正是在于它从来不是停滞的。它不仅不会在敌对的思想面前倒下，而且只会更加茁壮地成长。
    我们希望在继续争鸣、结合整风的过程中，党内外的意见能够进一步沟通，彼此推心置腹，亲密无间。各地方、各部门、各单位的领导，应该继续鼓励人们大胆地争鸣，配合我们党内的整风，随时揭发和改正工作中的缺点和错误，随时处理人民内部的矛盾问题。
