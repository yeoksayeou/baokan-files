Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, May 14th: The CCP Fujian Provincial Committee is vigorously implementing the Central Committee's instructions on launching a rectification movement by adopting the method of concentrating county party committee first secretaries in batches for study. As of the 11th, more than 200 leading cadres, including first secretaries and propaganda ministers of all counties (cities) in the province, have received a week of intensive study and training. The first batch of county party committee first secretaries and propaganda ministers from Jinjiang, Longxi, and Longyan regions, totaling more than 140 people, have returned to their respective areas to formulate rectification movement plans under the personal guidance of the county party committee first secretaries. They are also vigorously conducting propaganda and education among the people on the correct handling of contradictions among the people.

From late March to mid-April, the CCP Fujian Provincial Committee successively convened meetings of prefectural and municipal party secretaries and a provincial propaganda work conference to convey and discuss Chairman Mao's report on the correct handling of contradictions among the people. However, responsible cadres in various counties were preoccupied with current production and generally delayed or inadequately carried out the study, discussion, and dissemination of this report. After discovering this phenomenon, the CCP Fujian Provincial Committee adopted this method of centralized study, with Provincial Party Committee First Secretary Ye Fei and others giving study reports and answering their questions.

    中共福建省委大力开展整风运动
    分批集中县委第一书记进行学习
    据新华社福州14日电　中共福建省委采用分批集中县委第一书记学习的办法，来大力贯彻中央关于开展整风运动的指示。到11日止，全省各县（市）第一书记和宣传部长等负责干部两百多人，已先后受过一个星期的集中学习训练。第一批集中学习的晋江、龙溪和龙岩等地区的县委第一书记、宣传部长等一百四十多人已经回到各地，由县委第一书记亲自动手，订出各县整风运动规划，并且向人民群众大力进行正确处理人民内部矛盾的宣传教育。
    中共福建省委从3月下旬起到4月中旬止，曾先后召开地、市委书记会议和全省宣传工作会议，传达和讨论毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的报告。但是各县负责干部忙于当前生产，对于这个报告的学习讨论和传达工作，大都迟迟未能开展或开展不够有力。中共福建省委发现了这种现象以后，就采取这种集中学习的方式，由省委第一书记叶飞等向他们作学习报告和解答他们提出的问题。
