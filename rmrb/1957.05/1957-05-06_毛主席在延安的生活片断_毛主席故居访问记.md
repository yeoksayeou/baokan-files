Like everyone else, I was eager to know the stories of Chairman Mao's life during the Yan'an era. However, when I came to visit Chairman Mao's former residence, I felt a sense of unease. Whether it was due to reverence, admiration, or excitement, I suddenly became silent and serious. I walked into "Yan Garden," greedily gazing at every plant and tree within the garden. What an ordinary and simple garden! Our great leader led the Chinese people's liberation cause here.

Within the garden, several old tile-roofed houses are hidden deep in the shade of the trees, and a small stream meanders through the groves. These days, the peach and plum blossoms have faded, and the pear blossoms and lilac flowers are in full bloom. The lush and large flower spikes, like strings of fluffy snowballs, hang on the branches, quietly emitting a faint fragrance. According to the comrades who manage Yan Garden, these fruit trees produce thirty to forty dan of fruit every year. When the Party Central Committee lived here, the cadres had no allowances, and life was very difficult. Every year when the fruit ripened, Chairman Mao personally asked people to distribute the fruit to everyone.

I crossed the small stream, climbed up the hillside behind, and entered another small courtyard. This is where Chairman Mao used to live. Opposite, five cave dwellings are neatly arranged, and the painted doors and windows still retain their original colors. White gauze is nailed to the window lattices, and the roses, peach blossoms, and lilac flowers in front of the cave are blooming as luxuriantly as they used to. The courtyard is swept clean, and the doors and windows are quietly ajar. In Chairman Mao's office cave dwelling, a simple wooden table is placed in front of the window, as well as an old armchair with a backrest. Opposite, there are two sofas and a clothes rack. There is not a speck of dust on these utensils, and everything is fresh and simple.

The comrade who guided me through the visit pointed to the armchair with a backrest in front of the window and said: This is the chair that Chairman Mao sat on in Yan'an in 1937. At that time, the Party Central Committee had just arrived in Yan'an, and Chairman Mao lived in the cave dwelling of the masses. An old peasant, Wu Hanzhang, gave the chair from his home to Chairman Mao to use. The following year, the Central Secretariat moved to Yangjialing to live, and Chairman Mao returned the chair to Wu Hanzhang before leaving. In 1947, when Hu Zongnan's bandit army invaded Yan'an, Wu Hanzhang fought with the enemy for this chair. He had always treasured this chair as a family heirloom for twenty years, and only last autumn did he send it to the Yan'an Revolutionary Memorial Hall. Then, he said: Most of the utensils used by the responsible comrades of the Party Central Committee were destroyed by the Hu bandits. Most of these items on display now are relics from the former Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region government agencies, but from these utensils we can still see the difficult life of the Yan'an agencies in the past.

At that time, Chairman Mao's clothing and food were very frugal. Most of the clothes he wore were made of coarse cloth woven by local people. He wore a gray cotton-padded coat for three years. He was reluctant to throw away a pair of thick woolen socks knitted for him by someone else, even after they were worn out, and he kept mending them to wear them again. Chairman Mao ate two meals a day, each with only two dishes, mainly cabbage, potatoes, and tomatoes, with a little pork. The cook, Huang Yucheng, felt that Chairman Mao's food was too simple and asked to increase the food allowance, but Chairman Mao did not allow it and personally checked the food bills at the end of each month to ensure that they did not exceed the standard. So Huang Yucheng used his brains and tried his best to make the food better under the limited conditions. One day, Chairman Mao talked to him and asked with a smile: "Today's dishes are very well made, what's going on? Has my food allowance been exceeded?" Huang Yucheng said, "No." Then he explained how he had come up with a solution. Chairman Mao listened and nodded repeatedly, saying: "Very good, this food standard is stipulated by the Supply Department, and we must all abide by it. Now, our lives are in difficult times, the food money is less, but the dishes must be made better, what should we do? We need you to study it carefully…." I stood in front of the window, listening quietly to the manager's narration. At this time, the sun cast the shadows of the trees outside the window onto the window gauze, and the bees were buzzing busily in the flowers. I was immersed in deep imagination, as if I had personally seen Chairman Mao's work and life scenes in those years.

When I came out of Chairman Mao's courtyard, Xie Dengzhen and Shi Zaicheng, two old farmers from Zaoyuan Village, came. They had spoken with Chairman Mao many times, and I asked them to tell me some stories about Chairman Mao and the local people's relationship. They readily agreed and led me to wander through the woods at the foot of the mountain. We walked through the tree-lined path and came to the front of the former Central Secretariat Sanatorium, where we saw an open space surrounded by many flowers and trees. Shi Zaicheng said: "This used to be the open-air dance floor of the Secretariat. In those years, the yangko teams brought by the peasants to pay New Year's greetings to Chairman Mao performed on this ground." At that time, Chairman Mao and the responsible comrades of the Central Committee sat on the chairs next to them, and the masses and cadres formed a circle around them. As soon as the gongs and drums sounded, the yangko team members shyly began to sing. Chairman Mao was amused by the shy movements of several little girls and laughed from time to time. Xie Dengzhen said: Chairman Mao was very concerned about the production and life of the masses. In August 1944, a hailstorm hit Zaoyuan Township, and many autumn crops were destroyed, causing great unease among the masses. At that time, Chairman Mao sent a section chief from a department of the Party Central Committee to investigate the disaster. Subsequently, he distributed two shi of wheat that the peasants had previously cultivated for him as seeds to the masses. The following year, these wheat grew very well and achieved a great harvest. Usually, when farmers in Zaoyuan Village got sick, Chairman Mao asked the Central Medical Clinic to treat them for free. At the same time, he also asked the female cadres of the Secretariat to teach the women in the village how to spin thread. (At that time, the Party Central Committee advocated that government cadres engage in amateur labor production, and many cadres learned to spin thread.) A spinning competition was also held. The woman Shi Xiuying spun the best, and the Secretariat awarded her a spinning wheel. In the first month of 1943, Chairman Mao celebrated the birthdays of twenty-four elderly people in Zaoyuan Village, invited them to dinner, and Comrade Kang Sheng spoke on behalf of Chairman Mao at the meeting, and also gave each person a towel and a bar of soap.

When we walked to the small auditorium in the garden, Shi Zaicheng said: "In the past, Chairman Mao invited the people of this village to dinner here every Spring Festival." At that time, a square table was placed at this door, and Chairman Mao stood next to it to shake hands with and greet everyone who came. The head of each family came in new clothes. They brought gifts such as soft cakes, fried dough, yellow wine, and sesame candy to Chairman Mao, which were piled high on a table. Before the meal, Chairman Mao talked cordially with the masses, and many children surrounded him. Sometimes, the staff of the township ran over and glared at the children to scare them away. The children hurriedly grabbed Chairman Mao's clothes and hid behind him. Chairman Mao stood up to protect them, and the children looked at him with innocent smiles.

During the meal, more than a dozen tables were arranged in the auditorium. After the masses took their seats, each table had a leader accompanying them. At the beginning, Chairman Mao toasted everyone and said: "You are all my old neighbors, don't be polite. In a few days, I will go to your homes to see you…." Speaking of this, Shi Zaicheng laughed and said: "Originally, our village's sanitation work was not done well. Since Chairman Mao said this, every household has paid special attention. Every morning, we ask the women to sweep the floor clean and tidy up the tables and chairs, just afraid that Chairman Mao will suddenly come, and the cave is not clean, and we will be slow to him. From that year on, the sanitation work in our village has improved."

When I said goodbye to Xie Dengzhen and Shi Zaicheng, they said earnestly: "We still don't know when we will see Chairman Mao again, the people of Yan'an often think of him!"

    毛主席在延安的生活片断
    ——毛主席故居访问记
  　新华社记者　王永
    像其他人一样，我急切地想知道毛主席在延安时代的生活故事。可是，当我来访问毛主席的故居时，我的心里却产生了一种侷促不安的感觉。不知是由于虔敬、仰慕，还是由于兴奋、激动，我忽然变得沉默而严肃。我走进“延园”，贪婪地注视着园内的一草一木。一座多么平凡朴素的园林啊！我们的伟大领袖，就在这里领导了中国人民的解放事业。
    园内，几幢古老的瓦房，隐藏在林荫深处，一条小溪穿过树丛蜿蜒流去。这几天，桃李花谢了，梨花和丁香花开得正旺，那些又繁又大的花穗，像一串一串茸茸的雪球挂在枝头，静静地散着幽香。据管理延园的同志说，这些果树每年要结三、四十担水果。党中央住在这里时，干部没有津贴费，生活很艰苦；每年水果成熟了，毛主席亲自叫人把水果分给大家吃。
    我跨过小溪，爬上后边的山坡，进入另一个小院落，这就是毛主席过去的住处。对面整齐地排列着五孔窑洞，油漆过的门窗依然保留着从前的颜色，窗棂上钉上了白色窗纱，窑前的玫瑰、桃花和丁香花，开得和过去一样的繁茂。院子里打扫得干干净净，门窗悄悄地虚掩着。毛主席办公的窑洞里，窗前放着一张简陋的木桌，还有一只破旧的靠背圈椅，对面摆着两个沙发和一个衣架。这些器具上没有一点灰尘，一切都很清新、朴素。
    引导我参观的同志，指着窗前靠背圈椅说：这是1937年毛主席在延安时坐过的椅子。那时，党中央初到延安，毛主席就住在群众的窑洞里，农民吴汉章老汉把自己家里的椅子送给毛主席用。第二年，中央书记处搬到杨家岭去住，临走时毛主席又把这把椅子还给了吴老汉。1947年胡宗南匪军侵占延安时，吴老汉为了这把椅子曾和敌人进行过斗争。他一直把这把椅子当作传家宝似的保存了二十年，到去年秋季才把它送给了延安革命纪念馆。接着，他说：原来党中央负责同志使用过的器具，大都被胡匪破坏了。现在陈列的这些，多半是原陕甘宁边区政府各机关的遗物，但从这些器具上我们仍然可以看出过去延安机关的艰苦生活。
    当时，毛主席就在这个窗前办公。他的桌子上经常堆放着些书籍和报纸，还有一盏戴着罩子的美孚油灯。据说，毛主席最习惯在夜间办公，但他又很注意节省灯油。他写东西时，把灯头扭大，不写时就把灯头扭得很小。他经常工作到深夜，当远近村庄的人们都完全睡熟了的时候，他仍然在暗淡的灯光下，慢慢地踱着步子，思考国内外的种种问题。甚至到第二天清早，当别人已经起床时，还看见他的窗户有淡淡的灯光……。
    在那时候，毛主席穿衣吃饭都很俭朴，他穿的衣服也多半是用当地人织的粗布缝的。他有一件灰棉袄曾穿了三年，别人替他打的一双粗毛线袜子，已经穿破了，他还不愿意丢掉，仍然补了再穿。毛主席每天吃两顿饭，每顿只有两个菜，主要是白菜、洋芋和西红柿，还有一点点猪肉。炊事员黄玉成觉得毛主席的伙食太简单，曾要求增加伙食费，但毛主席不允许，并且每到月底，他要亲自检查伙食账，不准超过标准。于是黄玉成就开动了脑筋，尽量在仅有条件下把饭做得更好些。有一天，毛主席找他谈话，笑着问他：“今天的菜做得很好，是怎么回事？我的伙食没有超过吗？”黄玉成说“没有”。接着又把他如何想办法的事讲了一遍。毛主席听了连连点头说：“很好，这伙食标准是供给部规定下来的，我们大家都要遵守。现在，我们的生活正在困难的时候，伙食钱是少了些，菜却要做得好些，这怎么办呢？就要靠你们好好研究研究……。”我站在窗前，静听管理同志的讲述。这时，太阳把窗外的树影印上了窗纱，蜜蜂在花丛中嗡嗡??地闹；我沉浸在深远的想像中，仿佛亲眼看到毛主席当年工作和生活的情景。
    当我从毛主席的院落里走出来时，枣园村农民谢登珍和史再成老汉来了。他们曾经和毛主席谈过多次话，我请他们讲些关于毛主席和当地群众关系的故事。他们欣然地应允了，并且领着我到山下边的树林里去转。我们穿过林荫路，走到原中央书记处休养所前面，看到一块坪地周围栽着许多花木。史再成说：“这是过去书记处的露天舞场，那几年，农民给毛主席拜年带来的秧歌队，就在这个场子上演出。”那时，毛主席和中央负责同志坐在旁边的椅子上，群众和干部在他们的面前围成一个圈子。锣鼓一响，秧歌队员们就忸忸怩怩地演唱起来，毛主席被几个小姑娘羞涩的动作，逗得不时发笑。谢登珍说：毛主席非常关心群众的生产和生活，1944年8月，枣园乡下了一场冰雹，许多秋庄稼都被打毁了，群众的情绪很不安。当时，毛主席派党中央某部的一个科长去调查灾情。随后，就把过去农民替他代耕生产的两石麦子，发给群众做种籽。第二年，这些麦子长得很好，获得了一次大丰收。平时枣园村农民得了病，毛主席就让中央医务所给他们免费治疗。同时，还让书记处的女干部教给本村妇女纺线。（当时党中央提倡机关干部业余劳动生产，许多干部都学会纺线）还举行了一次纺线比赛，妇女史秀英纺得最好，书记处奖给她一架纺线车子。1943年正月，毛主席给枣园村的二十四个老人贺寿，请他们吃饭，康生同志代表毛主席在会上讲了话，还送给每人一条毛巾和一块肥皂。
    当我们走到园子中的小礼堂时，史再成说：“过去，每年春节，毛主席就在这里请本村群众吃饭。”那时，在这个门口放着一张方桌，毛主席站在旁边和每个来人握手接待。每家的家长都穿着新衣服来了。他们给毛主席带来软糕、油馍、黄酒、麻糖等礼物，满满地堆了一桌。吃饭以前，毛主席亲切地和群众谈话，许多小孩子围在他的身旁。有时，乡上的工作人员跑过来，瞪着眼睛吓唬小孩们走开；娃娃们急忙拉着毛主席的衣襟，往他的身后乱藏，毛主席站起来保护他们，娃娃们望着他憨溜溜地笑了。
    吃饭时，礼堂内排着十几张桌子，群众入席后，每桌都有一位首长作陪。开始，毛主席给大家敬酒，并且说：“你们都是我的老邻居，不要讲客气。过两天，我还要到你们家里去看看呢……。”说到这里，史再成笑了，他说：“本来我们这个村子的卫生工作作得不好，自从毛主席说了这话以后，我们家家户户就特别注意。每天清早就叫妇女们把地扫干净，把桌椅板凳都收拾好，就怕毛主席忽然来了，窑里不干净，慢待了他老人家。从这一年起，我们村子的卫生工作就好起来了。”
    当我向谢登珍、史再成告别时，他们恳切地说：“我们还不知道什么时候才能再见到毛主席，延安人民时常惦念着他！”（附图片）
