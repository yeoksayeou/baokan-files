Xinhua News Agency, 18th — The Third National Congress of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League held a plenary meeting on the afternoon of the 18th. The delegates listened to the report on the Constitution (Draft) of the Communist Youth League of China.

In his report to the congress entrusted by the Second Central Committee of the Youth League, Luo Yi pointed out that the new League Constitution (Draft) was drafted on the basis of the current League Constitution, drawing on the experience of the League's construction in the past few years, and based on the new tasks and new requirements proposed by the new situation. He said that this Constitution (Draft), compared with the current League Constitution, does not involve changes in the fundamental nature of the League. However, there are some significant and principled amendments, which require us to raise the League's construction to a higher level in order to better meet the requirements of the Party and the people, meet the requirements of the youth, and better exert its pioneering and shock force role among the broad masses of young people and in socialist construction.

The congress then warmly welcomed the youth representatives from Indonesia, Hungary, Italy, and France to deliver speeches.

Ten representatives spoke at today's meeting. Gao Tianhui, the representative of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, spoke first, reporting to the congress on the work of the Youth League in the People's Liberation Army. Peng Xucheng, the representative of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, introduced the achievements of this corps in production and construction in the northwest frontier of the motherland to the congress. Xuekang Tubdain Nyima, Secretary of the Youth League Tibet Working Committee, introduced the patriotic unity and progress of the youth of all ethnic groups in Tibet to the congress. Ma Chenglun, a youth representative from Shanghai, introduced at the congress how he transformed from a "street hooligan" into a model worker.

In the middle of the meeting, one hundred and thirty Young Pioneers sounded their bugles and beat their bronze drums to come to the meeting place, bringing with them the respect of 280,000 Young Pioneers in the city to congratulate the big brothers and sisters present.
