Starting from the Ideological Basis of "Walls" and "Trenches"
　　Zhang Naiqi

    I. What is the ideological basis of "walls" and "trenches"?

    Many people have said that there is "a wall" and "a trench" between the Party and non-Party members. Now I would like to talk about what the ideological basis of "walls" and "trenches" really is. I think, first of all, this ideological basis, as mentioned in Party documents and by others, is of course that the Party has achieved great victories in leading the revolution and construction, and has been supported not only by the people of the whole country, but also praised by fair-minded people all over the world. This is a very good thing, but it has side effects: many non-Party members have a sense of inferiority towards Party members; some Party members have complacency and arrogance. Secondly, I want to talk about dogmatism again. "The History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) Short Course" records Stalin's oath when mourning Lenin, which begins by saying: "We Communists are people with special character. We are made of special material." Due to the influence of this sentence, many non-Party members may look at Party members with special eyes, and some Party members who are not well-cultivated inevitably regard themselves as special. In this way, this sentence naturally becomes an ideological basis for "walls" and "trenches."

    I have not yet found out what objective need Stalin had to say this sentence at that time; judging from the text alone, this sentence is unscientific and carries a mystical color. The statement that Communists are made of special material will immediately be understood as: Communists are born to be made of Communist material. I have also heard another explanation: "made of special material" refers to the education of revolutionary theory and the training of the organization. But some people disagree, believing that these are only the processing of the material, not the material itself. I think that although both explanations can be established, as a sentence with the nature of a political slogan, it should not have two possible explanations; it must be clear enough to enable the masses to understand it correctly by intuition.

    It must be stated that the Chinese Communist Party's education of its members has nothing in common with the above-mentioned sentence. Chairman Mao's teaching to Party members is to be modest and prudent, and to oppose arrogance and complacency. The old Party Constitution opposed Party members being conceited and arrogant, and required Party members to be determined to learn from the people. The "Eight Requirements for Communist Party Members" clearly stipulates that "Party members are servants of the people, not 'masters' of the people." The "Eighth National Congress" documents have stricter requirements for Party members, and the explanations are more detailed and specific. Because of this, most of the Party members we see are simple and modest. Despite the fact that the rectification movement has exposed many mistakes and shortcomings committed by Party members and Party organizations, and more mistakes and shortcomings will be exposed in the future, this is completely understandable. In addition to the reasons that everyone is prone to make mistakes and shortcomings, and that leaders and the masses see problems from different angles, there is also a very noteworthy point: more than 12 million Party members. As long as 1% of Party members make serious mistakes, the absolute number is more than 120,000 people. So many people making mistakes in leadership positions will cause huge damage to the country and the people; and the exposure of these many facts will of course be a hot topic in the national newspapers for a long time.

    However, despite the fact that the CCP's education of Party members is a completely different set, it does not mean that the statement that Communist Party members are made of special material does not play a role in our country. Because "The History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) Short Course" was studied nationwide, and dogmatism was very popular both inside and outside the Party. It is difficult to imagine that this statement would not have a fairly serious dogmatic effect.

    The facts are already very clear. For example, the established policies and policies of the Party and the government are not secret, but should be widely publicized so that everyone knows them. Like us senior cadres, we have participated in countless important meetings in the past eight years and participated in the formulation of policies and policies; what the Party expects of us is to grasp the policies and policies and help the Party and the government to publicize them to the broad masses of the people. However, there are still some non-Party comrades who believe that they cannot grasp the policies and policies, and that only Party leaders can grasp the policies and policies. After eight years, it is still the same, which cannot be said to be a clear proof of inferiority, right? At the same time, many Party leaders also believe that only Party members can grasp the policies and policies, and non-Party members cannot. Is this arrogance and complacency, regarding oneself as special? Is this a form of sectarianism? Of course, it is entirely possible that the understanding of policies and policies is not enough and inaccurate. However, as long as non-Party members do not feel inferior, and Party members do not regard themselves as special, the shortcomings of being insufficient and inaccurate can be completely compensated through comradely assistance.

    Secondly, regarding the mastery of Marxism-Leninism, there is also a meaning of "only one shop, no branch." There is no doubt that the Party is the authority of revolutionary theory, which no one can deny. But this does not mean that the Party has a "monopoly" on revolutionary theory; it is by no means as some people think that only Party members can be Marxists-Leninists, and non-Party members cannot achieve results in the study of revolutionary theory. Under the control of this wrong idea, the theoretical study promoted by the Party has become a promotion of dogmatism in many occasions. Non-Party members study revolutionary theory with a sense of inferiority, and of course there can be no creativity; if they do not study theory creatively, of course, they can only study dogmatically. Some Party members appear in the position of "theoretical masters," disregarding everyone else, and of course they are prone to become dogmatists.

    Therefore, I feel that in the work of "demolishing walls" and "filling trenches," in addition to doing many other things, it is necessary to criticize the dogma that Communist Party members are made of special material. If the Party checks on great-power chauvinism and Han chauvinism, and also checks on great-party chauvinism, the situation may be very serious. Of course, at the same time, democratic parties should also check their bourgeois political party thinking of not accepting leadership.

    II. Between Party organizations and administrative systems

    The situation of "the Party replacing the government" does exist; it is less at the central level and more at the lower levels. I have this idea: many Party members do not have enough understanding of the role of state organs, and do not fully realize that state organs are the Party's weapon for carrying out revolution and building socialism. Therefore, not only are state administrative organs not sufficiently used, but state power organs are also not sufficiently valued—the situation that people's congresses below the county level are not held normally and are not substantial exists seriously.

    I agree with Vice Chairman Guo Moruo's speech at the Third Session of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference: the Party's leadership is like the nervous system, and the leadership of scientific research, the leadership of literature and art, and the leadership of administration are like the respiratory system, the digestive system, the circulatory system, etc.; the Party's leadership is implemented in all systems, but it cannot replace the role of each system (the memory is like this, there may be discrepancies).

    I have another analogy: the Party organization is like the director of a play, and other state organs are like actors, artistic and technical personnel, and management personnel. Directors generally do not have to go on stage themselves, and should not replace artistic and technical personnel and management personnel. In this way, the Party organization can make its mind clearer, its leadership more comprehensive, and more proactive. Taking people causing trouble as an example, if the administration is allowed to handle it first, and the Party organization provides guidance and support, and only comes out to explain and explain when it is absolutely necessary, the matter can be handled better. If you personally come out from the beginning, it is good if you handle it well, but if you handle it badly, it will become rigid.

    Analogies can never be completely accurate. However, in any case, strengthening the Party's political and policy ideological leadership on the basis of a clear division of labor and giving full play to the enthusiasm of each system is obviously conducive to doing the country's work better.

    III. Criticism of the United Front Work Department

    The United Front Work Department certainly has great achievements, but it also has serious shortcomings. The formation of shortcomings is inseparable from the wrong view that there are no contradictions within the people. There are originally many rights and wrongs between bourgeois elements and petty-bourgeois elements, and sectarianism originally existed. The United Front Work Department should be aware of this. The method adopted by the United Front Work Department is to emphasize the centralized aspect and relax the democratic aspect; to support a certain faction and suppress other dissenting elements or factions, without insisting on explaining the truth and distinguishing right from wrong. Therefore, it has helped to foster some dictatorial style and patriarchal style. Naturally, it has also helped to foster sectarian activities. Moreover, due to the bureaucratism of some Party members and some non-Party members treating Party members as "superiors," it sometimes seems that the United Front Work Department is participating in sectarian activities. In fact, today, it is unlikely to engage in sectarian activities in democratic parties without taking up the banner of the United Front Work Department implicitly or explicitly.

    The United Front Work Department often adopts a simplified method of identifying people, without a deep understanding of the complexity of non-Party members' personalities, and without fully recognizing that the hypocrisy and fame-seeking ideas left over from the old society still exist seriously in some people. In addition, the circle is drawn small, and it is inevitable to listen to only one side; those who run errands diligently are considered to be approaching the Party, otherwise, even if they are loyal and hardworking, and strive to implement the Party's policies and policies, they will inevitably be placed in the ranks of dissidents. Some people say that there is a vulgar style of "getting paid according to work" and a sectarianism of "awarding favors to relatives" in the political work of democratic parties. Even if this criticism is not entirely in line with reality, it is worth the United Front Work Department's examination. Probably, the work of the United Front Work Department is too busy, and being too busy can also lead to bureaucratism. Those who are yes-men, echo others, are easy to deal with, and are good at helping to suppress dissenting opinions are considered to be active and loyal; those who like to make suggestions and insist on their own opinions always feel troublesome and are regarded as "making independence." This is why the Party has repeatedly called for opposing personal worship and opposing unprincipled flattery, but personal worship and unprincipled flattery still exist; the Party has repeatedly demanded to hear different opinions, but different opinions are always difficult to give full play to. What we often see is a harmonious atmosphere, but once it breaks out, it often turns into a war of words that is difficult to clean up. If the United Front Work Department can expand the circle in the future and go deep into the organs and lower levels of the democratic parties (there are many dark corners there), and pay more attention to distinguishing between true and false and distinguishing right from wrong, I think it will be of great help to improving the work of the democratic parties. It is good to change from managing too much directly in the past to managing less and investigating more; it is not appropriate to manage less and not investigate.

    It is inevitable that non-Party members' criticisms of the Party's work are one-sided and superficial, and are only for reference.

### 从“墙”和“沟”的思想基础说起

    从“墙”和“沟”的思想基础说起	　章乃器
    一、“墙”和“沟”的思想基础是什么？
    已经有不少人说过，党与非党之间有“一道墙”、“一条沟”。我现在想来谈一谈“墙”和“沟”的思想基础究竟是什么。我想，首先，这个思想基础，如同党的文件和其他各位所说的，当然是党领导革命和建设取得了伟大的胜利，不但受到了全国人民的拥护，而且也受到了全世界公正人士的赞扬。这是很好的事情，但发生了副作用：不少非党人士对党员有自卑感；某些党员则有骄傲自满情绪。其次，我又要说到教条主义了。“联共党史”记载了斯大林在哀悼列宁时候的誓词，一开头就说：“我们共产党员是具有特种性格的人。我们是由特殊材料制成的。”由于这一句话的影响，可能有不少非党人士便以特殊的眼光看待党员，某些修养不够的党员，也就不免以特殊自居了。这样，这一句话自然也就成为“墙”和“沟”的一种思想基础了。
    我还没有找寻出来斯大林当时说这句话有什么客观的需要；单从文字看来，这句话是不科学的，是带着神秘主义的色彩的。共产党员是特殊材料制成的说法马上就会被理解为：共产党员一生出来就是做共产党员的材料。我也听到过另一种解释：“特殊材料制成”指的是革命理论的教育和组织的锻炼。但有人不同意，认为这些都只是对材料的加工而不是材料的本身。我想，尽管说两种解释都可以成立，作为一种带政治口号性质的句子，也是不应该有可此可彼的两种解释的；它是必须明确到足以使群众单凭直觉就可以正确理解的。
    必须说明，中国共产党对党员的教育同上述的句子是毫无共同之处的。毛主席对党员的教导是谦虚谨慎，反对骄傲自满。旧党章是反对党员自高自大，要求党员决心向人民群众学习。“共产党员的八个条件”更明白规定“党员是人民的勤务员，不是人民的‘老爷’”。“八大”文件对党员的要求更严格了，说明得也更为详尽而具体。正因为如此，所以，我们所看到的党员，绝大多数是朴素的、谦虚的。尽管进行整风运动以来已经揭发了许许多多的党员和党组织所犯的错误和缺点，而且今后还会揭发更多的错误和缺点，这是完全可以理解的。除了每个人都难免有错误和缺点，以至领导和群众看问题的角度不同这一些理由以外，还有很值得注意的一点：一千二百多万党员。只要有1％的党员犯严重的错误，绝对数字就是十二万多人。这么多人在领导地位上犯错误，对国家和人民就会造成巨大的损害；而这许多事实的揭发，当然可以在全国报纸上热闹得很长一个时期。
    但是，尽管中共对党员的教育是截然不同的另一套，也并不意味着共产党员是特殊材料制成的这一种说法就不在我国起作用。因为， “联共党史”曾经在全国展开学习，而教条主义是在党内党外都很流行的。说这种说法不会起到相当严重的教条主义的作用，是难以设想的。
    事实也已经很明白。例如，党和政府的既定方针、政策，不但不是秘密，而且应该是大肆宣传，做到家喻户晓的。像我们这些高级干部，八年来参加了无数次的重要会议，参加了方针、政策的制定；党所期望于我们的，正是掌握方针、政策，帮助党和政府向广大人民群众展开宣传。但是，竟还有些非党同志，认为自己不可能掌握方针、政策，只有党员领导同志才能掌握方针、政策。八年了，仍然是这一套，这不能不说是自卑感的明证吧？同时，也有不少党员领导同志，以为只有党员才能掌握方针、政策，非党人士是不行的。这是否骄傲自满，以特殊自居呢？这是不是宗派主义的一种形式呢？当然，体会方针、政策不够，掌握不准，是完全可能的。但，只要非党人士不自卑，党员不以特殊自居，通过同志式的帮助，不够、不准的缺点是完全可以弥补的。
    其次，关于马克思列宁主义的掌握，也有“只此一家，别无分店”的意味。毫无疑义，党是革命理论的权威，这是没有人能够否认的。但这绝不等于党对革命理论的“垄断”；绝不是如某些人所想的那样，只有党员可能是马克思列宁主义者，而非党人士就不可能在革命理论学习中取得成绩。在这种错误思想的支配之下，就使得党所推动的理论学习在许多场合变成了教条主义的推广。非党人士带着自卑感学习革命理论，当然就不可能有什么创造性；不是创造性地学习理论，当然，就只能是教条主义地学习了。某些党员以“理论大师”的地位出场，旁若无人，当然也容易变成教条主义者。
    因此，我觉得，在“拆墙”、“填沟”的工作中，除了要做好其他许许多多的工作以外，批判共产党员是特殊材料制成的这一条教条是必要的。如果党在检查大国主义和大汉族主义之外也检查一下大党主义，情况可能是很严重的。当然，在这同时，民主党派也应该检查自己的不接受领导的资产阶级政党思想。
    二、党组织与行政系统之间
   “以党代政”的情况，的确是存在的；中央较少，愈到下层愈多。我有这样的想法：不少党员对国家机构的作用还没有足够的认识，没有充分认识到国家机构是党进行革命和建设社会主义的武器。因此，不但国家行政机构没有被足够地运用，国家权力机构也没有被足够地重视——县以下的人民代表大会开会不正常和不充实的情况是严重存在着的。
    我同意郭沫若副主席在二届三次政协全国委员会的发言：党的领导有如神经系统，科学研究领导、文艺领导、行政领导有如呼吸系统、消化系统、循环系统等等；党的领导贯彻到各个系统，但不能代替各个系统的作用（记忆如此，可能有出入）。
    我还有另一种比喻：党组织有如戏剧的编导，其他国家机构有如演员、艺术技术人员和管理人员。编导一般不必自己上前台，更不应代替艺术技术人员和管理人员。这样，党组织可以使自己的头脑更加清醒，领导更加全面，而且更加主动。以人民闹事为例，如果先让行政负责处理，党组织加以指导和支持，只有在十分必要的时候才出来作解释和说明，事情就可以处理得更好一些。如果一开始就亲自出马，处理得好固然没有什么，处理不好就闹僵了。
    比喻总不可能完全确切的。但，无论如何，在明确分工的基础上加强党的政治和政策思想领导，充分发挥各个系统的积极性，显然是有利于把国家工作做得更好的。
    三、对统战部的批评
    统战部工作当然有很大的成绩，但也有严重的缺点。缺点的形成，是同不承认人民内部有矛盾的错误看法分不开的。资产阶级分子和小资产阶级分子之间，是非本来是很多的，宗派本来也是存在的。这一点，统战部应该是知道的。统战部处理的方法，是强调集中的一面，放松了民主的一面；扶植某一个派别，压服其他意见不同的分子或派别，而没有坚持讲清道理、明辨是非。因而曾经助长了一些独裁作风和家长作风。自然也就助长了宗派活动。更由于某些党员的官僚主义和某些非党人士以“上司”对待党员，看起来有时似乎统战部在参加宗派活动。实际上，今天在民主党派中进行宗派活动，如果不是若隐若显地拿起统战部的幌子，是不大可能的。
    统战部对人的鉴别往往采取简单化的方式，没有深刻认识到非党人士性格的十分复杂，也没有充分认识到旧社会遗留的虚伪作风和名位思想仍然在某些人物中严重地存在着。加上划圈子而圈子不大，多少不免偏听偏信；奔走殷勤的便算是靠拢党，否则即使忠心耿耿，埋头苦干，为贯彻党的方针、政策而努力，也难免被置于异己分子之列。有人说，民主党派存在着政治工作也适用“按劳取酬”的庸俗作风和“论亲行赏”的宗派主义。这种批评即使不完全符合实际，也值得统战部的检查。大概，统战部的工作太忙了，太忙也会发生官僚主义。唯唯诺诺，随声附和，容易对待的，以至善于帮同压服不同意见的，便算积极，便算忠实；欢喜提意见，而又坚持自己的主张的，总不免感到麻烦，便作为“闹独立性”。这就是为什么党一再提出反对个人崇拜，提出不要有无原则的捧场，而个人崇拜和无原则的捧场仍然存在；党再三要求听到不同的意见，而不同的意见总难充分发挥。我们经常看到的是一团和气，但一旦爆发起来也往往变成舌剑唇枪，难以收拾。统战部今后如能放大圈子，深入民主党派的机关和下层，（那里面有不少阴暗的角落）对分清真假、明辨是非上多多注意，我想对于改进民主党派的工作是有很大帮助的。由过去直接管得太多而改变为少管一些、多查一些，这是好的；少管而又不查，那就不大恰当了。
    非党人士批评党的工作，总难免是片面的、表面的，只供参考。
