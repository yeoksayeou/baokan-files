    Congratulations
      Shen Yanbing
    In my personal capacity (as a member of the literary and art circles, a Chinese painting enthusiast), I would like to congratulate the Beijing Chinese Painting Academy.
    The establishment of the Chinese Painting Academy is the result of Chinese painters striving for self-improvement and producing works to serve the people, and it is the result of the struggle against dogmatism and sectarianism.
    In this matter, the Ministry of Culture (1) lacked foresight and was unable to take the initiative; (2) it procrastinated and remained indecisive as the struggle gradually intensified, only resolving to support the reasonable demands of the Chinese painters at the last minute.
    I hope that the Chinese Painting Academy will always maintain this tradition, strengthen unity, and learn from each other's strengths. I hope that the Chinese Painting Academy will not develop a "native dogmatism" after rejecting foreign dogmatism, but will instead embrace "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," and open a new page in the history of Chinese painting.
    I hope that the Chinese Painting Academy will surpass the achievements of all previous painting academies in Chinese history and become an academic institution for the research, creation, and cultivation of the next generation of Chinese painting, carrying on the past and opening up the future. I hope that all members of the Chinese Painting Academy will fight against the tendency towards bureaucratization.
    The main body of the Chinese Painting Academy is the painters, not a small number of administrative staff. If in the future, phenomena similar to those occurring in universities, such as department secretaries directing department heads, administrative interference in artistic creation, research, teaching, etc., also occur here, I, as a writer, am willing to wield my pen and use satire as a weapon to support everyone.
    At the same time, I am also willing to use satire as a weapon to fight against social opinions, such as the demand that socialist ideology be used to educate the people even in flower and bird paintings!
    I hope that calligraphy, the sister art of Chinese painting, will be revitalized and flourish, despite its precarious state.
    I wish all comrades of the Chinese Painting Academy good health. I wish the Chinese Painting Academy, under the leadership of Director Ye and all members of the Academy Affairs Committee, increasing prosperity and development!

    祝辞
      沈雁冰
    谨以个人资格（文艺界一分子，中国画爱好者），向北京中国画院祝贺。
    中国画院的成立是中国画家们自强不息，拿出货色为人民服务的结果，是和教条主义宗派主义斗争的结果。
    文化部，在这件事上，（一）缺乏远见，不能主动；（二）在斗争逐渐尖锐时又得过且过，拖延不决，直到最后五分钟方始决心支持中国画家们的合理主张。
    祝中国画院永远保持这个传统，加强团结，学习众长。希望中国画院不会反掉了洋教条以后又生出土教条来，而是“百花齐放、百家争鸣”，为中国画史开辟新的一页。
    祝中国画院超越中国历史上所有一切画院的成就。成为继往开来的中国画的研究、创作和培养后一代的学术机构，希望中国画院的所有成员和可能发生的“衙门化”的倾向作斗争。
    中国画院的主体是画家，而不是少数的行政人员。如果将来也发生了像大学里发生的系秘书指挥系主任、行政干涉艺术创作、研究、教学等等，我以作家身份，愿奋秃笔，用杂文这武器，为各位后盾。
    同时，我也愿意以杂文为武器，同社会上的议论，——例如要求花卉翎毛也用社会主义思想教育人民等等作斗争！
    祝国画的姊妹艺术——书法，在不绝如缕的情况下，恢复青春，发扬光大起来。
    祝中国画院全体同志们的健康。祝中国画院在叶院长和全体院务委员领导之下，日益繁荣发展！
