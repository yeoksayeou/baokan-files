    Weather Station
    (and another poem)
     Fu Chou

    In this vast wilderness valley there is a weather station,
    A Tibetan girl is capturing wind and snow, observing clouds.
    On the mountain, agricultural cooperative members gaze here daily,
    Seeking news of the storm's tracks, asking when the sun will come?
    The cooperative members love this weather station,
    Even more than they worship temples.
    The cooperative members say: This girl is competing with the fairies,
    Seeing who has the ability to manage the world above!

                    1957.4.19 Late at night, Chengdu

    On Partridge Mountain, more than four thousand meters above sea level, [Note]
    Lights burn every night;
    Terrifying gales scream at the mountain peak;
    Rotting trees in the forest are split into sections,
    What's strange is there is a light that never goes out!
    It's really as mysterious and charming as the magic lamp in a fairy tale,
    In fact, it is merely a lamp in a road maintenance crew's dwelling.
    It is as brave and tenacious as the road maintenance workers,
    No violence can ever steal this light!
      1957.4.19 Late at night, Chengdu
    [Note] Partridge Mountain is on the Chengdu-Aba highway.

    气象台
    （外一首）
     傅仇在这莽莽的野谷里有一座气象台，一位藏族姑娘在捕捉风雪，观察云彩。山上，农业社社员天天向这儿眺望，探听风暴的踪迹，询问太阳几时来？社员们喜爱这座气象台，比对庙宇还更崇拜。社员说：这姑娘在和仙女比赛，看她们谁有本领来管理天上的世界！
                    1957.4.19深夜，成都
    灯光在拔海四千多公尺的鹧鸪山上，〔注〕夜夜有恐怖的狂风在山头呐喊；森林中腐朽的树木被劈成几段，奇怪的是有一盏长夜不灭的灯光！这真像童话中的神灯一样神秘迷人，其实，它只不过是道班房的灯火一盏它和养路工人的性格一样勇敢顽强，任何暴力总是偷不走这盏灯光！
      1957.4.19深夜，成都
    〔注〕鹧鸪山，在成（都）阿（坝）公路上。
