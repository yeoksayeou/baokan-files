Xinhua News Agency, May 3rd Dispatch from Bonn: The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Council's Bonn meeting opened on May 2nd. Britain's decision to reduce its armed forces was criticized during the first day of the meeting.

This "Foreign Ministers' Meeting" of the NATO Council, attended by the foreign ministers of NATO member states, was convened after the Soviet Union sent notes to several NATO member states warning of the dangers of deploying nuclear weapons, and following Britain's recent decision to cut its armed forces. It is reported that these two issues dominated the discussions on the first day of the meeting.

West German Chancellor Adenauer delivered a speech at the opening ceremony, in which he vehemently argued for the existence of a so-called "potential Soviet threat," and expressed his rejection of any proposals to establish a neutral zone in Western Europe or to neutralize Germany. After the opening ceremony, the meeting went into closed session. According to Western news agencies, Dulles "boosted the morale" of other countries at the meeting, urging them not to "weaken their defense" under Soviet warnings, but to continue strengthening NATO's military position.

He also expressed concern that Britain's reduction of its armed forces might trigger a "chain reaction among NATO member states."

Dulles assured the allies that the United States intends to fully implement its "defense plan" proposed to the Council meeting last December. He said that the United States would not follow Britain's example of reducing its armed forces, although the United States, like Britain, would rely more on the "deterrent force" of nuclear weapons.

When discussing the Middle East issue, Dulles attempted to downplay the unease caused by the Suez Canal issue in Western European countries.

Reports say that the foreign ministers of West Germany, France, Norway, and the Netherlands expressed dissatisfaction with Britain's decision at the meeting. West German Foreign Minister Brentano, whose country is rebuilding its army, said that Britain had no right to take "unilateral action" to reduce its armed forces. He said that we cannot afford NATO countries to reduce their conventional forces stationed in West Germany.

French Foreign Minister Pineau believed that the West could not rely solely on nuclear weapons. He said, "A balance must be maintained between nuclear weapons and conventional weapons."

Reuters reported that one of the arguments put forward by the foreign ministers who criticized Britain's decision was that it would create an "imbalance" within NATO: "Britain will simply rely on the deterrent power of nuclear weapons in the future, leaving the task of providing manpower and cannon fodder to the armies of Western European countries."

    北大西洋集团波恩会议开幕
    杜勒斯鼓吹加强侵略政策
    各成员国对英国裁军决定吠影吠声
    据新华社3日讯　波恩消息：北大西洋公约组织理事会波恩会议在5月2日开幕。英国削减军队的决定在第一天会议上受到了指责。
    这次由北大西洋集团各国外交部长出席的理事会“外交会议”，是在苏联向北大西洋集团若干成员国发出警告它们配备核武器的危险的照会和英国最近决定削减军队之后召开的。据报道，这两个问题在第一天会议的讨论中占着主要地位。
    西德总理阿登纳在开幕式上致词，他竭力说存在着所谓“苏联的潜在威胁”，他表示拒绝关于建立西欧中立区和使德国中立化的任何建议。在开幕式后，就进入秘密会议。据西方通讯社报道，杜勒斯在会上给其他国家“打气”，要它们不要在苏联警告下“削弱防御”，而必须继续加强北大西洋集团的军事地位。
    他又表示担心英国削减军队的做法可能在北大西洋集团“成员国之间引起链锁反应”。
    杜勒斯向盟国保证，美国打算充分实行它在去年12月向理事会会议提出的“防御计划”。他说，美国不效法英国那样削减军队，虽然美国像英国一样将更多地依靠核武器的“威慑力量”。
    杜勒斯在谈到中东问题时力图冲淡苏伊士运河问题在西欧国家所引起的不安。
    消息说，西德、法国、挪威和荷兰等国的外交部长在会上纷纷对英国的决定表示不满。正在重建军队的西德的外交部长勃伦塔诺说，英国没有权利采取“片面行动”来裁减它的军队。他说，我们经不起北大西洋公约组织国家削减它们驻在西德的常规军队。
    法国外交部长比诺认为西方不能单依靠核武器。他说，“必须保持核武器和传统武器间的平衡”。
    路透社报道，指责英国决定的外交部长们提出的一个论据是：这样会造成北大西洋公约组织的“不平衡”：“英国今后将单纯地依靠核武器的威慑力量，而把提供人力和炮灰的事留给西欧各国军队”。
