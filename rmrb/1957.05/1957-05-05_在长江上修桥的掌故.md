Anecdotes about Building Bridges over the Yangtze River

In 974 AD, Emperor Taizu of the Song Dynasty, Zhao Kuangyin, wanted to attack the Later Tang Dynasty (also known as the Southern Tang Dynasty). He used the plan of the Jinshi Ma Ruoshui and sent people to build a pontoon bridge at Caishiji in Dangtu County, Anhui Province. In three days, the bridge was built, and the army crossed the bridge as if walking on flat ground. Li Houzhu (Li Yu), who was indulging in a life of "wine and women," thought it was "nonsense" when he heard that the Song army was building a pontoon bridge, believing that the Yangtze River was an insurmountable barrier and that building a bridge was impossible. When the Song army directly attacked Jinling, Li Houzhu had to "hurriedly bid farewell to the temple" and live the life of a prisoner. This was the first Yangtze River bridge, dating back 983 years.

In December 1852, the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom peasant revolutionary army advanced into the three towns of Wuhan, and on the 22nd, troops were dispatched to both sides of Wuchang and Hanyang to "camp along the river." In order to connect the two banks, on the night of the 24th, ships were connected on the river to form two pontoon bridges. On the 29th, the Taiping army crossed the Han River, occupied Hankou, and built another pontoon bridge in the Qiaokou area to connect to the opposite bank. In this way, the Taiping army in the three towns of Wuhan was united as a whole, which effectively strengthened the offensive. On January 16 of the following year, the Taiping army officially built a larger pontoon bridge from Qingchuan Pavilion in Hanyang directly to the Jiang'an of Hanyangmen in Wuchang. This large pontoon bridge was made of huge cables tied horizontally with large timbers, covered with plank barriers. Contemporary records say that on the bridge, "people and horses came and went, walking as if on a flat road." This was the second large bridge on the Yangtze River, dating back 104 years.

In 1913, graduates of the Bridge Department of Peking University, with full enthusiasm, surveyed the bridge site and made some designs with the support of the famous engineer Zhan Tianyou. Later, some engineering personnel conducted three more surveys, wanting to build a modern bridge. However, under the reactionary rule, their wishes could not be realized.

    在长江上修桥的掌故
    公元974年宋太祖赵匡胤想进攻后唐（也叫南唐），用进士懋若水的计策，派人在今安徽当涂县的采石矶搭浮桥。三天功夫，就把桥搭起来了，军队从桥上走过，如履平地。整天沉湎在“灯红酒绿”的生活里的李后主（煜），听人说宋军在搭浮桥，还以为是“胡闹”，认为长江天堑，无法搭桥。等到宋军直捣金陵，李后主只好“仓皇辞庙”，去过俘虏生活。这是第一座长江大桥，距今已有九百八十三年了。
    1852年12月，太平天国农民革命军进兵武汉三镇，22日分拨武昌、汉阳两岸，“夹江为营”。为了沟通两岸的联系，24日夜间用船只在江上联结成两座浮桥；29日太平军渡过汉水，占领汉口，又在礄口一带搭一道浮桥通向对岸。这样，武汉三镇的太平军就联成一体，有力地加强了攻势。次年1月16日，太平军正式从汉阳晴川阁搭一座更大的浮桥直达武昌汉阳门江岸，这座大浮桥是用巨缆横缚大木，上复板障。当时的记载上说：桥上“人马往来，履若坦途”。这是长江上的第二座大桥，距今已有一百零四年。
    1913年北京大学桥梁系毕业生怀着满腔热情，在著名工程师詹天佑支持下，测量过桥址，作过一部分设计；以后有些工程人员，又作过三次勘测，想建一座现代桥梁。但是，在反动的统治下，他们的愿望没法实现。　　　　（郑重）
