    Promoting International Friendship and Defending World Peace
    Chinese and Japanese Youth Join Hands
    Dear Editor of the People's Daily:
    We have long hoped to correspond with Chinese friends and consider it the happiest thing.
      Since World War II, Japan has been an isolated country in the East, but we, the younger generation, sincerely want to restore friendly relations with all countries in the world. To achieve this goal, we are willing to make every effort. In order to establish friendly relations with young people from all over the world, Japan has established the Youth International Liaison Council to conduct international friendly correspondence activities through this organization. We would like to establish friendship with your people through mutual correspondence, exchanging books, pictures, drawings, stamps, etc. Many young people in Japan are willing to learn from China in all aspects. We look forward to hearing from Chinese friends.
                  Hamada Morio, 3328 Miyoshicho, Tsuchiura City, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan
        Tsuzuki Tokuo, 3rd District, Onikubo, Uwa Town, Higashiuwa County, Ehime Prefecture, Shikoku, Japan
    Dear Editor of the People's Daily:
    I am writing this letter to you out of a sincere desire to deepen the friendship between us and your people with the pen.
    Your country's neighbor, Japan, is the first country in the world to be bombed by atomic bombs, sacrificing hundreds of thousands of people. Therefore, we Japanese deeply feel that there is nothing more precious in the world than peace and friendship.
    I think we should correspond with each other regardless of nationality, strengthen friendship, and make beneficial contributions to defending world peace. Chinese friends: Let us use the hands of friendship to build strong steel cables to stop war and defend world peace!
    I sincerely hope that Japan and China will restore diplomatic relations as soon as possible. I look forward to hearing from Chinese friends.
        Hanagata Kanji, 1586 Nishiku, Higashicho, Shikishima Town, Nakakoma County, Yamanashi Prefecture, Japan
    Dear Japanese young friends:
    I am an eighteen-year-old youth working in a supply and marketing cooperative. I was very happy to see your letter to Chinese youth in the People's Daily. Your letter exposed the dangers of atomic bombs, which made me involuntarily shed tears of sympathy for your – the Japanese youth friends and the Japanese working people – encounters.
      Japanese youth are witty, brave, and energetic patriots. Whenever we hear about your heroic struggles against imperialism, we are unforgettable and deeply moved. There are many things about Japanese youth that are worth learning from. We are willing to be friends with Japanese youth and strengthen communication.
    Finally, let us work together to oppose the use of atomic weapons to kill mankind, to defend world peace, and to strengthen the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people!
                  Ma Zhishan, Supply and Marketing Cooperative, Xiaying District, Ji County, Hebei Province, China
    Dear Japanese friend – Mr. Yoshida Katsuhisa:
    I was very happy to read your letter in the People's Daily. I regard it as a great honor for Chinese and Japanese youth to make friends.
    Japan is the first country in the world to suffer from atomic bomb disasters. The United States dropped atomic bombs on Japan, causing irreparable losses and sacrifices to the Japanese people. I would like to use this letter, in addition to making friends with you, to further unite the youth of China and Japan to fight to prevent war and defend world peace.
    I am a young teacher who just graduated from school last year and is now teaching mathematics at the Harbin Forestry Institute. If you also become a teacher after graduation, then we are soldiers on the education front. I am currently learning Japanese. There are many young teachers in our school. In response to the government's call to "march towards science," we are working and studying hard. The library of our school has various books, including many Japanese books, which provide us with great convenience in understanding Japan.
    Long live the friendship between Chinese and Japanese youth!
        Jin Shunbo, Forest Industry School Attached to Northeast Forestry Institute, Harbin, China

    促进国际友谊保卫世界和平
    中日两国青年手拉手亲爱的人民日报总编辑先生：
    我们很早就盼望能和中国朋友通信，把它看成是最快乐的事情。
      日本自第二次世界大战以后，在东方是一个孤立的国家，但是我们年轻的一代，衷心地想与世界上各个国家恢复友好关系。为了
  达到这个目的，我们愿尽一切努力。为了和世界各国青年建立友好关系，日本已经成立了青少年国际连络协议会，通过这个组织，进
  行国际友好通信活动。我们想通过互相通信，交换书籍、画片、图画、邮票等，来和贵国人民建立友情。日本有许多青年人愿意向中
  国各方面进行学习。期待着中国朋友的来信。
                  日本茨城县土浦市三好町三三二八　浜田守男
        日本四国爱媛县东宇和郡宇和町大字鬼洼三区　都筑德雄亲爱的人民日报总编辑先生：
    我给你写这封信，是出于这样一个衷心愿望：用笔来加深我们和贵国人民的友情。
    你们国家的近邻——日本，是世界上第一个遭受原子弹轰炸、牺牲了几十万人的国家。所以，我们日本人深深感到在世界上没有比和平和友谊更贵重的东西了。
    我觉得我们应该不分国籍互相通信，加强友谊，为保卫世界和平做出有益贡献。中国朋友们：让我们用友谊之手结起坚固的钢索来阻止战争，保卫世界和平！
    我衷心期望中日两国早日恢复邦交。期待着中国朋友的来信。
        日本山梨县中巨摩郡敷岛町东町西区一五八六　花形莞司亲爱的日本青年朋友们：
    我是十八岁的青年，在供销合作社里工作。我从人民日报上看到了你们给中国青年的来信，十分高兴。你们的信揭露了原子弹的危害，使我情不自禁的为你们——日本的青少年朋友们和日本的劳动人民——的遭遇落下了同情的眼泪。
      日本青年是机智、勇敢、生气勃勃的爱国主义者，每当我们听到你们反对帝国主义的英勇斗争事迹时，我们久久难忘而且深受感动。日本青年有许多地方值得我们学习，我们愿意和日本青年做朋友，加强通信联系。
    最后，让我们共同为反对使用原子武器杀害人类、为保卫世界和平和加强中日两国人民的友好而奋斗！
                  中国河北省蓟县下营区供销合作社　马志山日本亲友——吉田胜久先生：
    我在人民日报上读到你的来信，非常高兴。我把中日两国青年交朋友的事，看成是极大的荣幸。
    日本是世界上第一个遭受原子弹灾害的国家。由于美国在日本投下了原子弹，使日本人民受到了不可弥补的损失和牺牲。我想通过这封信，除了和你交朋友以外，更希望中日两国青年进一步紧密地团结起来，为防止战争、保卫世界和平而斗争。
    我是去年刚从学校毕业、现在哈尔滨森林工业学院教数学的一个青年教师。你毕业后，如果也当教师的话，那么我们就是教育战线的战士了。我现在正在学习日文。我们学校有很多青年教师，我们为响应政府的“向科学进军”的号召，努力的工作和学习着。我们学校的图书馆里有各种各样的书籍，也有许多日文书籍，对我们了解日本有很大便利。
    中日两国青年友好万岁！
        中国哈尔滨市东北林学院附设森林工业学校　金顺伯
