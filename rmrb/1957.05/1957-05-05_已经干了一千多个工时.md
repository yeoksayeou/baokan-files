Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 4th - Ning Xuegen, the Chinese Communist Party Committee Secretary of Sichuan's Qianghua Iron Factory, Liu Junsheng, the Supervisory Committee Secretary, and Liu Yongfu, the Deputy Factory Director, spend half a day in the office and the other half leading department cadres down the mines and into the workshops to participate in labor. From the beginning of April until now, they have worked over a thousand work hours.

Ning Xuegen went down to the Madianzi Coal Mine to transport coal, loading each coal cart with over 800 catties. Liu Junsheng spent a week continuously transporting coal underground for eight hours each day. After handling his daily administrative work, Liu Yongfu always took four or five hours to pick coal and load kilns with the coal and coke workers, studying with the workers how to shorten the coking time. Some department cadres have also signed apprenticeship contracts with veteran workers, determined to quickly master the operating techniques.

The practice of leading cadres directly participating in production labor has strengthened the relationship between leaders and the led, and between management and production personnel, and many problems in production have been solved in a a timely manner. For example, after the blast furnace workshop completely switched to using sintered ore, the supply of coking coal was insufficient. Deputy Factory Director Yang Shaoqing and Workshop Director Yang Jieshan listened to the workers' opinions and, together with the workers, successfully tested three operational methods to ensure the coking needs of the blast furnace. The original daily coal output of the Madianzi Coal Mine was only 40 tons. After the cadres went down to the mine, they helped the workers solve key production problems, increasing the output to about 100 tons.

    已经干了一千多个工时
    新华社成都4日电　四川省强华铁厂中共党委书记宁薛根、监委书记刘俊生和副厂长刘永福，每天半天办公，半天带领科室干部下井、下车间参加劳动。从4月初到现在，他们已经劳动了一千多个工时。
    宁薛根到马店子煤矿井下运煤，每辆煤车装八百斤以上。刘俊生有一个星期连续每天在井下运煤八小时。刘永福每天处理完日常行政工作以后，总要抽出四、五小时和煤焦工人一起挑煤、装窑，和工人研究如何缩短焦化时间。有的科室干部还和老师傅订立了师徒合同，下决心要迅速掌握操作技术。
    领导人员带领干部直接参加生产劳动的作法，密切了厂里领导和被领导、管理人员和生产人员的关系，生产中许多问题及时得到了解决。例如高炉车间全部改用为烧结矿以后，焦煤供应不足，副厂长杨绍清、车间主任杨介山听了工人的意见，和工人一道试验成功了三种操作经验，保证了高炉用焦需要。马店子煤矿原来每天的采煤量才四十吨，干部下井以后，帮助工人解决了生产上的关键问题，将产量提高到一百吨左右。
