Kunming dispatch from our newspaper on the 19th: At 6:50 PM, Chairman Voroshilov's special plane pierced through a few low-lying white clouds and appeared over Kunming. At this time, the golden sunlight shone on the cheering crowds at the airport, and flocks of larks flew and sang overhead, welcoming the distinguished guest of the Chinese people, Chairman Voroshilov. Voroshilov took off his white straw hat and saluted the welcomers at the cabin door. After getting off the plane, he shook hands with Ji Pengfei, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Liu Minghui, Acting Governor of Yunnan Province, Xie Fuzhi, First Secretary of the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and others who had flown in from Beijing to welcome him.

Wherever Voroshilov went, hands reached out to present flowers. When he walked in front of the ranks of the Yunnan Nationalities Institute, composed of fifty-two ethnic groups, he stopped. Voroshilov affectionately stroked the shoulder of a Dai girl offering flowers and said in Chinese, "Hello, thank you."

At 7:15 PM, Voroshilov boarded the car to go to Kunming city. When boarding, Voroshilov shook hands with the driver to express his gratitude. Voroshilov will depart tomorrow to visit the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

    昆明人民腾欢迎伏老
    本报昆明19日电　下午六时五十分，伏老的专机穿过了几朵低矮的白云，出现在昆明上空。这时，金色的阳光照射着机场上欢腾的人群，成群的百灵鸟在上空飞鸣着，和人群一起迎接中国人民的贵宾伏罗希洛夫主席。伏老摘下了白色的草帽，在机舱口向欢迎者答礼。下飞机后，他同从北京专程飞来迎接的外交部副部长姬鹏飞、云南省代省长刘明辉、中共云南省委第一书记谢富治等一一握手。
    伏老走到那里，那里就伸出了手，送上鲜花。当他走到由五十二个民族组成的云南民族学院的行列前的时候，他停住了。伏老亲切地抚摸着一个献花的傣族姑娘的肩膀，用中国话说：“你好，谢谢你。”
    七点十五分，伏老登车去昆明市区，登车时，伏老和司机握手表示感谢。伏老将于明日启程赴越南民主共和国访问。
