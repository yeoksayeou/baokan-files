Comprehensive report by our newspaper:

French Prime Minister Mollet said at a cabinet meeting on the 15th that France had been abandoned by its closest allies on the Suez Canal issue, thus finding itself isolated on the world stage. After the cabinet meeting, Mollet announced that the French government had decided to submit the Suez Canal issue to the United Nations Security Council. He said that France considers Egypt's current conditions for passage through the canal "unacceptable," and that France will "continue to boycott the canal" until the Security Council makes a decision.

On the same day, France formally lodged a "protest" with the United Nations in New York regarding the decision of the Suez Canal Users Association to cease boycotting the canal.

A spokesman for the Central Committee of the French Shipowners' Association said on the 15th that French shipowners had requested the government to hold an emergency consultation with them so that the government could understand the huge losses to French economic interests caused by its continued boycott of the Suez Canal.

This decision was made at an emergency meeting of the committee on the evening of the 14th.

The Shipowners' Association spokesman also said that this was not the first time the committee had warned the government of the damage to the French economy caused by solely using the longer and more expensive Cape of Good Hope route. He said, "Every day brings new and huge consumption of (French) foreign exchange."

    摩勒抱怨英国向埃及低头
    宣布法国继续抵制运河
    船主协会要求政府不要死撑自讨苦吃
    本报综合报道　法国总理摩勒15日在内阁会议上说：在苏伊士运河问题上，法国被它最亲密的盟友抛弃了，因而在世界舞台上陷于孤立。摩勒在内阁会议后宣布，法国政府决定把苏伊士运河问题提交联合国安全理事会。他说，法国认为埃及目前关于通行运河的条件是“不能接受的”，在安全理事会作出决定以前，法国将“继续抵制运河”。
    同一天，法国就苏伊士运河使用国协会决定停止抵制运河的作法在纽约向联合国正式提出“抗议”。
    法国船主协会中央委员会的发言人15日说，法国船主们已经要求政府为他们举行一次紧急的意见听取会，以便让政府明白由于它继续抵制苏伊士运河而给法国经济利益造成多么巨大的损失。
    这个决定是委员会在14日晚上的一次紧急会议上作出的。
    船主协会发言人还说，委员会并不是第一次警告政府由于单独使用更长的和费用更大的好望角航线而使法国经济受到损害。他说，“每过一天就给（法国）外汇带来新的巨大的消耗”。
