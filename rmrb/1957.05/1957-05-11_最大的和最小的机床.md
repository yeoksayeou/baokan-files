　　As far as we know, the Soviet Union has a largest 1594-type vertical lathe, which weighs 1,400 tons, is 35 meters long and wide, and is as high as two stories. It can process objects with a diameter of 23 meters. The Soviet Union also has a smallest C-945 type bench lathe, which weighs only a little over seven kilograms. Placed on a table, it is about the size of a cigarette and can process objects as small as half a millimeter.

    最大的和最小的机床
    据我们所知，苏联有一座最大的一五九四型立式车床，它的重量有一千四百吨，长、宽有三十五公尺，有两层楼那么高，它可以加工直径二十三公尺的物件。苏联还有一座最小的C—九四五型台式车床，全身重量只有七公斤多，放在桌子上跟一条卷烟那么大，它可以加工半个米厘那么小的物件。
