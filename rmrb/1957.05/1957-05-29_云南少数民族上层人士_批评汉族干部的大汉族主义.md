Yunnan's Ethnic Minority Upper-Class Representatives
Criticize Han Cadres' Han Chauvinism

(Reported by our Kunming correspondent) Recently, people from all walks of life in Yunnan Province have been deeply studying Chairman Mao's report, exposing the contradictions among the people from various perspectives.

Some upper-class representatives of ethnic minorities have exposed the tendency of Han chauvinism in ethnic minority areas. Some said that the Party has always attached great importance to the training of ethnic minority cadres, but it is still far from meeting the current needs of the work. For example, there are very few ethnic minority cadres in courts, supervision departments, and armed forces. Some said that ethnic minority cadres generally feel caught in the middle. On the one hand, some Han cadres belittle the role of ethnic minority cadres, take everything into their own hands, and do not consult with ethnic minority cadres when things happen; on the other hand, ethnic minority masses are also dissatisfied with their own ethnic cadres, believing that they cannot represent the interests of their own ethnic group and only act as translators or guides for Han cadres.

Miao representative Wang Hongdao said: "The People's Government has done a lot of work in the past few years, and the achievements are extremely great. Government agencies at all levels are appropriately equipped with ethnic minority cadres. However, there is still room for improvement in this regard. For example, some ethnic minority cadres have positions but no power and feel mentally depressed; some cadres' actual difficulties cannot be resolved for a long time, and they are unwilling to continue working; still others have weak work abilities and low cultural levels, make mistakes in their work or fail to complete the tasks assigned by their superiors, are criticized, hurt their self-esteem, and want to return home to engage in agricultural production. Li Fupeng said: "There are still a small number of outside cadres who still retain remnants of Han chauvinism, act like veterans, believe that ethnic minority cadres are inferior to themselves, and even dislike and discriminate against them, fail to take care of their customs in life, and fail to consider their difficulties in work. Some Han cadres say that ethnic minority cadres have low levels, no culture, and are stupid, believing that promoting ethnic minority cadres to leadership positions is giving them too much credit, and they do not respect the powers of ethnic minority cadres, causing ethnic minority cadres to be very distressed and unwilling to work in government agencies, preferring to go to the countryside to run errands.

Many people believe that whether a Party member truly serves ethnic minorities wholeheartedly should first be tested by his attitude towards ethnic minority cadres.

### 云南少数民族上层人士  批评汉族干部的大汉族主义

    云南少数民族上层人士
    批评汉族干部的大汉族主义
    本报昆明讯　最近期间云南省各方面人士深入学习毛主席的报告，从各个不同的角度揭露出人民内部的矛盾。
    部分少数民族上层人士揭露了少数民族地区存在着的大汉族主义倾向。有的说，党对培养民族干部一向是很重视的，但距离目前的工作需要还差得远。如法院、监察、武装部队中少数民族干部就很少。有的说现在少数民族干部中普遍有一种两头受气的感觉。一方面，某些汉族干部轻视少数民族干部的作用，包办代替，遇事不同少数民族干部商量；另一方面，少数民族群众也对本民族的干部不满意，认为他们不能代表本民族的利益，只是起了汉族干部的翻译或引路的作用。
    苗族人士王弘道说：“几年来人民政府做了不少工作，成绩是极大的。各级政府机关都适当地配备了少数民族干部。可是在这方面还有需要改进的地方。例如有的少数民族干部有职无权，思想苦闷；有的干部实际困难长时间得不到解决而不愿意继续工作；还有的是工作能力弱，文化水平低，在工作中发生错误或是不能完成上级交给的任务，受到批评，伤了自尊心，想回家搞农业生产。李福鹏说：“还有少量的外来干部尚存在着大汉族主义的思想残余，摆老资格，认为少数民族干部不如自己，甚至厌恶、歧视他们，在生活上不照顾他们的习惯，在工作上不体贴他们的困难。有的汉族干部说民族干部水平低，无文化，脑子笨，认为提拔少数民族干部担任领导工作是抬得太高了，不尊重少数民族干部的职权，致使少数民族干部很苦恼，不愿在机关工作，愿意下乡跑腿。
    很多人认为党员是否真正全心全意为少数民族服务，首先要考验他对少数民族干部持什么态度。
