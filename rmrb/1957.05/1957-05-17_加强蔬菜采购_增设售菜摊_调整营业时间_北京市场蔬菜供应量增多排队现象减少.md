    Strengthening Vegetable Procurement, Increasing Sales Stalls, Adjusting Business Hours
    Beijing Market Vegetable Supply Increases, Queuing Phenomenon Decreases

    Since Beijing implemented unified purchasing of vegetables, it has adopted a series of measures that have increased market supply and reduced queuing.

    After the city implemented unified vegetable purchasing on May 6th, although vegetable prices fell and the market tended to stabilize, some problems also arose. For example, the number of vegetable sellers was insufficient, causing people to wait in line for too long; chives and scallions were not supplied, and the allocation of other vegetables was not balanced enough (the main streets and free markets were basically able to supply them, but the new districts and some small alleys were not adequately taken care of). Therefore, some citizens reported that buying vegetables was somewhat inconvenient.

    After discovering the above problems, the Beijing Market Management Committee took the following measures:

    First, strengthen purchasing and control sources of goods. In addition to maintaining close contact with agricultural cooperatives in the suburbs of the city and promptly purchasing vegetables, it also sent more cadres to various places for purchasing. From the 12th to the 14th, 420,000 jin of cucumbers, garlic sprouts, and white radishes were transported from Shanghai, Henan, and other places. From the 6th to the 15th, the Chaoyangmen vegetable station purchased 300,000 jin of various vegetables. Yesterday, the Dongdan vegetable station purchased more than 10,000 jin of scallions from Tongxian and Shunyi counties in Hebei Province. The city's average daily import from other places increased by about 10% compared to before management.

    Second, while increasing the supply to free markets and the retail management office adding vegetable stalls, the vegetable company also added more than 100 mobile vegetable carts to general streets and small alleys (one of which was sent to the market), and is preparing to transfer some personnel from related industries to further strengthen this aspect of the business.

    Third, in order to solve the problem of insufficient vegetable varieties, it is currently purchasing insufficient varieties such as scallions and chives from other places, while increasing the supply of bean sprouts, sprouted beans, tofu and other soy products.

    Fourth, in order to reduce commodity circulation links, the Dongdan District Vegetable Joint Operations Group directly linked up with suburban agricultural cooperatives a few days ago. Now the agricultural cooperatives are directly delivering vegetables to the Joint Operations Group, increasing the freshness of the vegetables. Some units have also adjusted their business hours, opening earlier, reducing the waiting time for people to buy vegetables.

    After taking the above measures, the supply of vegetables in the Beijing market has increased, and the phenomenon of queuing to buy vegetables has also decreased. ·Liu Shicheng·

    加强蔬菜采购　增设售菜摊　调整营业时间
    北京市场蔬菜供应量增多排队现象减少
    北京市自从对蔬菜实行统一收购以后，接着又采取了一系列的措施，使市场供应量有了增加，排队现象亦有所减少。
    这个市在5月6日实行蔬菜统一收购后，虽然蔬菜价格下落、市场趋向稳定，但也发生了一些问题。如售菜的人数不足，使群众排队等候时间过长；韭菜、小葱等供应不上，其他蔬菜在调拨上也不够平衡（对主要街道及自由市场基本能供应的上，但对新建区及某些小胡同则照顾不够）。因此，有的市民反映买菜有些不方便。
    北京市场管理委员会发现以上问题后，曾经采取了如下几项措施：
    一，加强收购，掌握货源。除了和本市郊区各农业社取得密切联系并及时收购蔬菜外，还增派干部多人到各地进行采购。从12日到14日的三天中，已由上海、河南等地运到黄瓜、蒜苗、白萝卜等四十二万斤；6日到15日，朝阳门菜站采购到各种蔬菜三十万斤；东单菜站昨由河北省的通县、顺义购到小葱一万多斤。全市每天平均较管理前外埠进货增加10％左右。
    二，对自由市场增加供应量、由零售管理处增设售菜摊的同时，菜蔬公司还对一般的街道和小胡同增加了一百多辆流动售菜车（内有一部派到市场去了），并准备抽调一部分有关行业人员进一步加强这方面的业务。
    三，为解决蔬菜品种不足的问题，目前正在外地采购小葱、韭菜等不足品种，同时增加了豆芽菜、芽豆、豆腐等豆制食品的供应量。
    四，为了减少商品周转环节，东单区蔬菜联营组于前几天与郊区农业社直接挂勾，现在农业社已直接给联营组送菜，增加了蔬菜的新鲜程度；有的单位还调整了营业时间，提前开门，减少了群众等待购菜的时间。
    采取以上措施后，北京市的市场蔬菜供应量已经有了增加，排队买菜的现象亦有减少。·刘世成·
