Beijing Higher Education Leaders Offer Criticism and Suggestions to the Ministry of Higher Education at a Symposium

    (Our Newspaper Dispatch) The Ministry of Higher Education invited presidents and deans of some universities in Beijing to a symposium yesterday afternoon, asking them to offer criticisms and opinions on the work of the Ministry of Higher Education to help the Party organization of the Ministry of Higher Education rectify its work style.

    At the meeting, Yang Xiufeng, Minister of Higher Education, asked everyone to offer opinions to the leaders of the Ministry of Higher Education without any reservations, especially to the responsible comrades of the Party members. He earnestly said that the Ministry of Higher Education must not rectify its work style behind closed doors this time, but must rely on everyone's criticism and rely on various universities to help us rectify our work style. At the same time, the Ministry of Higher Education should rectify its work style while solving problems.

    Qian Duansheng, President of Beijing University of Political Science and Law, said, "I basically agree with Professor Qian Weichang's opinion on the training objectives of higher industrial schools. After a college student receives four or five years of higher education, what kind of person does the state train them into? The ministry should humbly study this issue and absorb more opinions from veteran professors. Due to the different nature of various majors, the methods of professors are also different. Some professors enable students to lay a solid foundation in school so that they can work independently as soon as they leave school. Others allow students to learn certain things in school and then train them in their jobs. Which of these different methods is better should be carefully studied.

    Regarding Professor Fei Xiaotong's mention of restoring the Department of Political Science and the Department of Sociology in universities, I think some courses in these two departments can be placed in certain majors, and it is not necessary to establish separate departments. It is not good to set up too many departments. Regarding the issue of textbooks, I think we should let go, publish books boldly, and reduce the difficulties for teachers and students in teaching.

    I also suggest that the bureaucratic style of school institutions should be diluted, and it is not good for schools to call themselves chiefs.

    Some people hold too many concurrent positions, which makes it difficult to do their work well. I alone hold fourteen positions, some of which are nominal, which can easily lead to detachment from the masses and foster a bureaucratic work style.

    President Qian Duansheng also expressed his opinions on the arrangement of school work and relying on non-Party school leaders.

    Zhou Peiyuan, Vice President of Peking University, said, "I will not talk about achievements here, but only about shortcomings. What are the shortcomings in the work of the Ministry of Higher Education in leading universities to carry out teaching reforms in recent years? I think we have had a lot of goal-oriented blindness in recent years. We are very clear about the overall goal of learning from the Soviet Union to carry out teaching reforms, and it is definitely correct. But how to achieve this goal, how to follow the path of learning from the Soviet Union in teaching reforms? I think this issue is not very clear to both the Ministry of Higher Education and the universities, and the most blind is this point. A large set of things learned from the Soviet Union, such as teaching plans and teaching syllabuses, have been sent to the schools. Although many teachers support learning from the Soviet Union, many professors have some opinions because the specific guidelines and steps in business are not clear. I think that in learning from the Soviet Union to carry out teaching reforms, the Ministry of Higher Education does not rely enough on veteran teachers, and does not pay enough attention to the research of teaching business. Therefore, the situation of veteran teachers "hearts toward the academy" has arisen. Of course, the good conditions and equipment of the Academy of Sciences are also a reason for creating "hearts toward the academy." And when universities want to carry out scientific research work, veteran professors become treasures, but the banner has already been planted in the Academy of Sciences. Therefore, I say that the Ministry of Higher Education, as the leader of teaching reform work, lacks foresight."

    Qian Weichang, Vice President of Tsinghua University, said, "I think there are laws in doing anything. If you can't even figure out the laws, you can't do things well. In recent years, the Ministry of Higher Education has not been able to figure out the laws of how to run a school well. How can a school be run well, and how can it not be run well; what is good, and what is not good, the ministry is not very clear. I think if the ministry could pay attention to this issue earlier, it could still figure out some laws, at least it could know how a school should be run under what conditions. Although the ministry also pays attention to exchanging experience in this area, it often requires us to come up with experience in two or three months. How can experience be produced in two or three months? The school has no choice but to report whatever experience the higher authorities want. In fact, the experience of this school is not necessarily suitable for that school, because the conditions of each school are different. The ministry always wants to unify an experience in the whole country. This kind of forced unification sometimes causes problems.

    Training teachers is a delicate and long-term task that cannot be treated simply, but the ministry has done this relatively simply. Every year, a large number of teaching assistants come to each school, but in fact, some of these teaching assistants are of very low quality and are not suitable for being teachers. I think that to train teachers, we should send the best people to train, not a mix of good and bad. If we want to do a good job in higher education, we must adhere to this. I remember that I raised this issue in 1952, and I also calculated an account, asking the leaders to study the issue of the source of teachers in higher education, but it did not attract attention. What they cared about was the issue of quantity. From a college student to a teacher who can work independently, this requires a long and arduous process of effort. At present, there are many in-service teachers, but no one has checked how well they have studied. I think that if you want to run a school well, you must rely on experienced teachers in the school. If the source of teachers cannot be guaranteed, the school cannot be run well.

    I think the ministry does not deeply understand the difficulty of running a school and establishing a laboratory. For example, it does not pay enough attention to relying on veteran teachers to run the school well. Teachers in the school are often transferred. Some teachers are transferred to the Academy of Sciences to engage in scientific research work, and some teachers do not know when they will be transferred. As a result, it creates "hearts toward the academy" and they are not at ease working in universities. Some research institutions that were originally very good have collapsed because people have been transferred away."

    At the meeting, Zhang Xiti, Vice President of Beijing Institute of Geological Exploration, Liu Yilun, Assistant President of Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, and Shi Ping, Vice President of Beijing Agricultural University, offered criticisms and suggestions on the leadership style of the Ministry of Higher Education, as well as on the training and improvement of teachers, the development of scientific research work, and the guarantee of the task and conditions for training talents.

### 北京高等学校负责人在座谈会上  向高等教育部提出批评和建议

    北京高等学校负责人在座谈会上
    向高等教育部提出批评和建议
    本报讯　高等教育部在昨天下午邀请了北京部分高等学校校院长举行座谈会，请大家针对高等教育部的工作提出批评和意见，帮助高等教育部党组织进行整风。
    会上，高等教育部杨秀峰部长要求大家毫无顾虑地给高等教育部的领导提意见，特别是对党员负责同志提意见。他恳切地说，高等教育部这次绝不能关起门来整风，一定要大家来批评，要依靠各高等学校帮助我们进行整风。同时，高等教育部要边整风，边解决问题。
    北京政法学院院长钱端升说，我基本上是同意钱伟长教授关于高等工业学校培养目标的意见的。一个大学生受了四五年的高等教育，国家究竟把他们培养成怎样的人？这个问题部里应该虚心地研究一下，多吸取老教授的意见。由于各种专业性质不同，教授的方法也是不同的，有的教授是使学生在学校里就打下坚固基础，一出学校，就能独立工作。有的则是让学生在学校学到一定的东西，将来到工作岗位上锻炼。这种不同的方法究竟哪种好应很好研究。
    关于费孝通教授提到在大学中，要恢复政治系和社会系的问题，我认为这两个系有些课可以放在一定的专业里，倒不一定要另成立系，摊子摆多了并不好。对于教科书问题，我认为要放手，大胆出书，减少教师、学生在教学中的困难。
    我还建议学校的机关化作风要冲淡些，学校也称什么首长不好。
    有些人兼职过多，反而工作做不好，我一人就兼了十四职，有些工作是挂名的，很容易造成脱离群众，养成官僚主义作风。
    对于学校工作的安排，依靠非党员的学校负责人等问题，钱端升院长也发表了意见。
    北京大学副校长周培源说，我这里不说成绩，光谈缺点。这几年高等教育部领导高等学校进行教学改革工作，缺点究竟在哪里？我认为这几年我们是有目标的盲目性很大。学习苏联进行教学改革，这总目标我们很清楚，也是肯定正确的。但是如何达到这目标，教学改革中学习苏联的这条路如何走？我觉得这问题高等教育部和高等学校都不太清楚，而最感盲目的就是这点。一大套学习苏联的东西如教学计划、教学大纲等都发到学校里去了，许多教师虽然都拥护学习苏联，但因为在业务上的具体方针步骤不明确，使许多教授都有些意见。我认为在学习苏联进行教学改革中，高等教育部依靠老教师不够，对教学业务的研究重视也不够。因此产生了老教师“人心向院”的情况。当然，科学院条件好、设备好，也是造成“人心向院”的一个原因。而等到高等学校要开展科学研究工作了，老教授才成了宝贝，但旗帜都已插到科学院中去了。因此，我说，作为领导教学改革工作的高等教育部，是缺乏预见性的。
    清华大学副校长钱伟长说，我认为办什么事都有规律，如果连规律还摸不透，事情是办不好的。几年来，高等教育部对怎样办好学校的规律是摸得不够的。一个学校怎样才能办好，怎样就办不好；什么叫好，什么叫不好，部里是不太清楚的。我认为如果部里能及早注意这个问题，还是可以摸出些规律的，至少可以知道什么条件下的学校应怎么办才好。部里虽然也注意交流这方面的经验，但常常是要我们两三个月内就搞出经验，经验怎么可能在两三个月内就搞出来呢？学校没办法，只好上面要什么经验，就汇报什么，其实这个学校的经验不一定适合那个学校，因为各校的条件不一样。部里总想把一个经验在全国统一，这种强求统一有时会出问题。
    培养教师是个细致、长期的工作，不能简单对待，但是部里在这方面是做得比较简单的。每年各校要来一大批助教，其实其中有些助教的质量很低，是不适合做教师的。我认为，要培养师资，就应送质量最好的人来培养，不能好坏搭配，要想把高等教育搞好，不坚持这一条是不行的。记得我在1952年就提过这个问题，并且还算了个账，要求领导上研究高等教育的师资来源问题，但并未引起重视，他们关心的却是数量问题。从一个大学生到一个能独当一面工作的教师，这中间要经过一个长期艰苦的努力过程。目前进修教师很多，但是他们进修得怎样，也没人检查过。我认为，要想把一个学校办好，就要切实依靠校内有经验的教师，如果教师的来源得不到保证，学校是办不好的。
    我认为部里对办一个学校、成立一个实验室的艰难性是体会不深的。例如对依靠老教师办好学校重视不够，学校里的教师常被调动，有些教师调到科学院从事科学研究工作，有些教师也不知道哪天会调走，结果就造成“人心向院”，不安心于高等学校工作。有些本来很好的研究机构由于人调走了而垮台。
    会上，北京地质勘探学院副院长张席禔、北京邮电学院院长助理刘宜伦和北京农业大学副校长施平等，针对高等教育部的领导作风以及对师资的培养提高工作、开展科学研究工作和保证培养人才的任务和条件等，提出了批评和建议。
