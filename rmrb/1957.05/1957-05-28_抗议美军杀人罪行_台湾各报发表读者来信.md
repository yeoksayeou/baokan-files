Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, 27th - Taiwan newspapers on the 24th published many readers' letters, angrily denouncing the crimes of American soldiers arbitrarily killing Chinese people in Taiwan.

    A letter to the editor published in Taichung's "Min Sheng Daily" said: "Reynolds kills Chinese people with impunity. How sad is this for us Chinese to hear! Sun Yat-sen struggled all his life to abolish unequal treaties and seek national freedom and equality... But now there is an unequal treaty that allows Chinese people to be killed, without trial, and left to be slaughtered by others!" The letter said: "The American advisory group's verdict is our utter shame and humiliation."
    A reader of Taipei's "Minzu Evening News" asked: "Are those who kill our Chinese people still 'friends'? I advise those pro-foreign bigwigs to wake up from the 'Reynolds incident'."
    A reader's letter in Keelung's "Minzhong Daily" angrily said: "With such a loss of human rights and sovereignty, and such bloody facts before our eyes, can we still endure it? Can we remain silent?"
    Many Taiwan newspapers have also criticized the American military for arbitrarily killing Chinese people. Taipei's "United Daily News" published an editorial entitled "Protesting the American Military's Disregard for Human Rights," accusing the American military authorities of shielding the murderer Reynolds. Hualien's "Geng Sheng Bao" said in its "Daily Talk" column: This incident has made every Chinese person in Taiwan feel spiritually distressed and threatened in their lives.

    抗议美军杀人罪行
    台湾各报发表读者来信
    新华社香港27日电　台湾各地报纸24日刊载了许多读者来信，愤怒控诉美军在台湾任意杀害中国人的罪行。
    台中“民生日报”登载的读者来信中，有一封说：“雷诺杀中国人无罪，我们中国人听来是多么可悲！孙中山毕生奋斗，是为废除不平等条约，而求民族之自由平等……。现在却来了一种使中国人被杀，无法审判，而听任别人宰割的不平等条约！”信上说：“美国顾问团之判决乃我们的奇耻大辱。”
    台北“民族晚报”一个读者问道：“杀我们中国人的，还算‘朋友’吗？我奉劝那些媚外的大人先生们，应该从‘雷诺事件’觉醒。”
    基隆“民众日报”的读者来信愤怒地说：“像这样丧失人权和主权，血淋淋的事实摆在眼前，我们再能忍耐吗？我们能再缄默吗？”
    台湾许多报纸也纷纷抨击美军任意杀害中国人。台北“联合报”以“抗议美军蔑视人权”为题发表社论，指责美军当局包庇杀人凶手雷诺。花莲“更生报”在“日日谈”栏里说：这一事件已使台湾每一个中国人精神感到沉痛，生命感到威胁。
