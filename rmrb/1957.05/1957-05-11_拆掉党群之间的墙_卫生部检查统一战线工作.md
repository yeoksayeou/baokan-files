    Tearing Down the Wall Between the Party and the Masses
    —Ministry of Health Inspects United Front Work
    Special contribution to this newspaper, Xinhua News Agency reporter Lü Xinchu reports: Many departments say there is a wall between the Party and the masses. What do these walls look like? Now let's take a look at the walls of the Ministry of Health!

      Insufficient Respect for the Authority of Non-Party Cadres
    The masses reflect: The Ministry of Health does not respect the authority of non-Party cadres enough and has not given full play to their roles. It is often heard that Minister Li Dequan does not understand the overall situation. Is it that the Party group reflects the situation to Minister Li too little? When discussing health work in 1956, only Party secretaries and directors of local health departments were called to a meeting, and non-Party directors and deputy directors within the ministry did not even receive the documents. Non-Party comrades in the Maternal and Child Health Department said that Director Yang Chongrui had the title but no real power. For example, her opinions were not valued during ranking and salary evaluations. Some people say that letting the masses discuss is just "for show." When the Cadre Department assigned a cadre to the Maternal and Child Health Department, Director Yang wanted to see the file, but a comrade from the Cadre Department said: "He is a Party member, you cannot see it."

    Promoting Cadres: Party Members First, Then Non-Party Members
    Some comrades say that the Ministry of Health's cadre policy is not to promote or trust non-Party members, and that their deployment is inappropriate. All cadres promoted to the level of section chief or above last year were Party members; the Ministry of Health promotes Party members first, then non-Party members. Some non-Party comrades were originally section chiefs, but after the restructuring, when the section was changed to a division, the original Party member deputy section chiefs were all promoted to deputy division chiefs, while the original non-Party section chiefs were not promoted. When something happens in the Medical and Preventive Department, the leaders consult Party member cadres, making non-Party cadres feel constrained. They dare not handle work themselves and must seek out Party members. Non-Party cadres in the Maternal and Child Health Department said that the work of Party members should be compared with that of non-Party cadres to see who does better. Some leaders in the Education Department often bypass non-Party section chiefs when dealing with work issues and directly grab Party member staff, rendering the section chief ineffective. When a Party member section chief goes on a business trip, the work of the section is not assigned to the non-Party section chief, but to a Party member staff member.
    Non-Party comrades in the Maternal and Child Health Department reflect that Party members do not understand the masses and provide no help. Their progress in recent years has come from reading newspapers and magazines and watching movies. Non-Party comrades in the Epidemic Prevention Department said that they do not get the opportunity to participate in professional learning. The year before last, they requested to participate in a lecture on sports and health supervision and submitted a request to the leadership, but it was not approved; however, a Party member who had just arrived at the Ministry of Health was told to attend the lecture.

        Party Member Responsible Cadres Not Concerned Enough About the Vital Interests of the Masses
    Some comrades accuse some Party member responsible cadres in the Ministry of Health of not being concerned enough about the vital interests of the masses, of not being able to set an example, and of not being able to share the joys and sorrows of the masses. At the end of the year, several thousand yuan of welfare funds were accumulated, supposedly because they were managed too strictly. Later, it was decided to provide subsidies to those in need, but in reality, most of the welfare funds were used on Party member section and division level cadres. Some people say that although everyone is supposed to get a share of the welfare funds, it is the veteran cadres and Party members who get more; some cadres in the Salary and Welfare Section and the Administrative Office think only of taking care of senior cadres and Party members. Distributing welfare funds cannot be like sending charcoal in the snow, but is rather like adding flowers to the brocade. The main Party member cadres of one unit all received subsidies, one of whom saved the subsidy to buy a watch, and another who already had savings in the bank also received a subsidy. It is also easier for Party members to get housing, while it is very difficult for non-Party staff to get housing.

        Old Party Members Are Self-Complacent and Arrogant, New Party Members Are Arrogant Even Without Merit
    Non-Party cadres in the General Office said this: Some Party members have privileged thinking. They are more often back-to-back with non-Party cadres, less often face-to-face, and especially rarely heart-to-heart. Party members are very polite to democratic personages. Some people were very active and humble before joining the Party, but once they joined the Party, they completely changed. Old Party members are self-complacent and arrogant, and new Party members are arrogant even without merit. Some people say that not seeing Party members feels like three autumns have passed; seeing Party members is like treating guests with respect, speechless, like unity, but with a gap in between. One non-Party comrade said that you can smell who is a Party member as soon as you enter the office. Some non-Party comrades said: "We have sincere words to say to the Party, but Party members do not tell us sincere words."

            In-depth Inspection to Strengthen Party-Masses Relations
    According to the instructions of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, the Party organization of the Ministry of Health has comprehensively launched a movement to inspect the united front work of the Ministry of Health since April 28th. Members of the Jiusan Society, members of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang, non-Party members, and Communist Party members were mobilized to hold multiple symposiums, which are called back-to-back inspections. The above materials were all revealed by Party and non-Party comrades at these symposiums. The back-to-back inspection has now ended. In the future, face-to-face inspections will be conducted to further solicit opinions from the masses; and to solve problems, clarify right and wrong, unify understanding, improve ideological level, and educate Party members to unite closely with non-Party masses and do a good job together. The Party organization of the Ministry of Health called on Party member responsible personnel to express their attitude and guarantee that they will not retaliate against those who offer opinions; at the same time, it called on the masses to eliminate all concerns and put forward opinions in a positive manner; some Party members with very prominent shortcomings should conduct realistic self-criticism, and some opinions raised by the masses that deviate greatly from the facts can be appropriately explained, but should not be "refuted" or "counterattacked."

    拆掉党群之间的墙
    ——卫生部检查统一战线工作
    本报特约稿　新华社记者吕新初报道：好些部门说党群之间有一道墙。这些墙是怎么个样子的？现在让我们来看看卫生部的墙吧！
      不够尊重非党干部的职权
    群众反映：卫生部对非党干部的职权不够尊重，没有很好发挥他们的作用。常听说李德全部长不了解全面情况，是不是党组向李部长反映情况太少了。1956年讨论卫生工作只召集各地的党员卫生厅局长开会，而部内非党司局长文件也领不到。妇幼司的非党同志说杨崇瑞司长有职无权，例如评级评薪时，她的意见不被重视。有人说，让群众讨论是“摆样子”。干部司分配一个干部到妇幼司来，杨司长要看档案，干部司一个同志说：“他是党员，你不能看。”
    提拔干部是先党内后党外
    有的同志说，卫生部在干部政策上，对非党员不提拔，不信任，使用安排不当。去年提拔的科处级以上的干部全都是党员；卫生部提拔干部是先党内后党外。有些非党同志原来都是科长，机构改变，科改为处以后，原来的党员副科长都提拔为副处长，而原来非党的科长反没有提升。医疗预防司的领导上有事便找党员干部，弄得非党干部束手束脚，有工作自己不敢处理，而要找党员。妇幼卫生司的非党干部说，党员的工作要和非党干部比一比，谁做得好。教育司有的领导人有工作问题常常不经过非党科长，而直接去抓党员科员，使科长不起作用。有位党员科长出差，科里工作不交给非党科长负责，却交给党员科员负责。
    妇幼司的非党同志反映，党员对群众不了解，什么帮助也没有，这几年来的进步是自己读报章杂志和看电影得到的。防疫司的非党同志说，业务学习得不到机会参加，前年要求参加体育卫生监督讲座，向领导提出要求，没有得到批准；而新来卫生部的党员，就叫她去听课。
        党员负责干部对群众切身利益不够关心
    有些同志指责卫生部有些党员负责干部对群众的切身利益关心很不够，不能以身作则，不能同群众共甘苦。年终积余了几千元福利金，据说是掌握过严了，后来就决定谁困难补给谁，而实际上大部分福利金都使用在党员科处级干部身上。有人说，福利金虽说人人有份，但也只是老干部和党员拿的比较多；工资福利科和行政处有的干部整个脑子都为照顾高级干部和党员着想，发福利金不能成为雪里送炭，却是锦上添花。有一个单位的主要党员干部都拿到补助金，其中有一人把补助费积存起来买手表，另外一人在银行中本来有存款，也拿了补助金。党员要房子也容易解决，而非党工作人员要房子则很难办到。
        老党员居功自傲，新党员无功也傲
    办公厅的非党干部这样说：有些党员有特权思想，他们和非党干部背靠背的时候多，面对面的时候少，尤其是心对心的时候少。党员对民主人士很客气。有的人没有入党的时候很积极、谦虚，但一旦入党，就完全变了样。老党员居功自傲，新党员无功也傲。有人说见不到党员如隔三秋，见到党员相敬如宾，相对无言，像是团结，但其中有隔膜。有个非党同志说，一进办公室，就可以嗅得出谁是党员。有的非党同志说：“我们有真心话向党讲，但是党员不同我们讲真心话。”
            深入检查，密切党群关系
    卫生部的党组织根据中共中央统一战线工作部的指示，从4月28日起全面开展了检查卫生部统一战线工作的运动，发动九三学社社员、国民党革命委员会会员、无党派人士以及共产党员分别举行了多次座谈会，即称为背靠背的检查。上述这些材料，都是党外党内同志在这些座谈会上揭发出来的。现在已结束了背靠背的检查，今后还要进行面对面的检查，进一步正面听取群众意见；并作到解决问题，澄清是非，统一认识，提高思想水平，教育党员同非党群众亲密团结，共同做好工作。卫生部党组织号召党员负责人员要表明态度，保证对提意见的人不报复；同时号召群众消除一切顾虑，正面提出意见；有些党员缺点很突出的，应实事求是地进行检讨，对群众提出的有些与事实出入很大的意见，可作适当说明，但不要“反驳”和“反击”。
