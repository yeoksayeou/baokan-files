    "Thank you very much, doctor! Your medicine has been very beneficial to me."
    "But, I haven't treated you! I think this is the first time I've seen you."
    "However, you treated my uncle, and I inherited his property, and in that property there are many of your medicines!"
            (Selected and translated by Zhang Guangqi)

    “非常感谢，大夫！您的药对我很有益处。”
    “可是，我没有给你医过病呀！我大概还是第一次看见您。”
    “但是，您给我叔父看过病，而我继承了他的财产，在这笔财产中有很多您的药啊！”
            （张光启选译）
