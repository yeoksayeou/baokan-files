Traveling in the Desert

The Baotou-Lanzhou Railway is approximately one thousand kilometers long and is a major artery connecting North and Northwest China. Construction on the southern section of this railway began in the autumn of 1955, and the northern and southern sections are expected to be fully connected by June 1958. Currently, the desert subgrade construction of the Zhongwei section of the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway has commenced. Tens of thousands of railway construction workers are working arduously in the vast desert, braving the erratic climate and the violent winds carrying sand and gravel. The left picture shows a camel team organized by the masses transporting stones to the construction site.

    在沙漠中行进
    包兰铁路全长约一千公里，是沟通我国华北和西北的大动脉。这条铁路的南段在1955年秋季开始施工，1958年6月南北两段可全线接轨。现在包兰铁路的中卫段沙漠路基已开始施工。数万名筑路大军不顾冷热无常的气候和飞沙走石的巨风，在茫茫的沙漠中艰苦工作。左图是群众组织的骆驼队正在往工地上运送石子。　（新华社记者　张杰摄）　右图是筑路工人在施工线上设置的用芨芨草制成的防沙栅栏。（田力摄）
