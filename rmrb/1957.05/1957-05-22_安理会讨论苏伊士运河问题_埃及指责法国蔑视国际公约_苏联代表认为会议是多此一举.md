Xinhua News Agency, May 21st, New York: The United Nations Security Council held a meeting on May 20th to discuss the Suez Canal issue. This meeting was convened at the request of the French representative.

    Soviet Representative Sobolev stated at the beginning of the meeting that there was no need for the Council to hold a meeting at this time, because the Egyptian government had already resolved the canal issue in accordance with the six principles adopted by the Council. Re-raising this issue now would only increase the complexity of the Middle East situation.

    French Foreign Minister Pineau insisted in his speech that Egypt's declaration was "unilateral" and that it did not conform to the six principles adopted by the Security Council. France believes that new discussions should be held to find a solution that complies with the six principles. Consultations on this issue could be conducted "in a format that we can discuss among ourselves."

    British Representative Dixon supported Pineau's opinion. He said that Britain would continue to seek an agreement with the Egyptian government through consultations.

    Egyptian Representative Loutfi expressed surprise at France's bringing the Suez Canal issue to the Security Council. He said that all members of the Council had already had the opportunity to express their views on the Egyptian declaration. This declaration reaffirmed Egypt's determination to respect the letter and spirit of the 1888 Convention of Constantinople and the rights and obligations stipulated in that convention. Egypt considers this declaration to be an international document, including obligations. If France believes that the Security Council's meeting last October was fruitless, then France itself is responsible, because the aggression against Egypt interrupted that meeting.

    Soviet Representative Sobolev pointed out in a second speech that France's desire to reopen the debate on the Suez Canal issue was an attempt to impose conditions on the navigation of the Suez Canal that were incompatible with Egypt's sovereignty. He said that the management of the canal was satisfactory to the user countries, and in his view, Egypt's declaration provided all necessary guarantees for the future. He only hoped that the management of other waterways such as the Panama Canal could be as satisfactory as the Suez Canal is today.

    Representatives from Cuba, Australia, and the Philippines also spoke at the meeting.

    The Council's next meeting will be held on May 21st.

    安理会讨论苏伊士运河问题
    埃及指责法国蔑视国际公约
    苏联代表认为会议是多此一举
    据新华社21日讯　纽约消息：联合国安全理事会5月20日举行会议，讨论苏伊士运河问题。这个会议是应法国代表的请求而举行的。
    苏联代表索波列夫在会议开始时发言指出，理事会目前并没有必要举行会议，因为埃及政府已经按照理事会通过的六项原则来解决运河问题，目前再次把这个问题提出来只会增加中东局势的复杂程度。
    法国外交部长比诺在发言中硬说埃及的宣言是“单方面”的，它不符合安全理事会通过的六项原则。法国认为应该举行新的讨论，设法找到符合六项原则的解决办法。关于这个问题的磋商可以“采取我们能够在我们之间讨论的形式”来进行。
    英国代表狄克逊支持比诺意见。他说，英国将继续谋求同埃及政府磋商协议。
    埃及代表卢特菲对法国把苏伊士运河问题提到安全理事会表示惊讶。他说，理事会所有成员国都已经有了机会表示它们对于埃及宣言的意见。这个宣言重申了埃及决定要尊重1888年君士坦丁堡公约的文字和精神以及这个公约规定的权利和义务。埃及认为这个宣言是一个包括义务在内的国际文件。如果法国认为安全理事会去年10月的会议毫无结果，那么法国自己要负责任，因为打断这次会议的是对埃及的侵略。
    苏联代表索波列夫在再次发言时指出，法国要重新就苏伊士运河问题展开辩论，是想在苏伊士运河航行问题上强加一些同埃及的主权不相容的条件。他说，运河的管理是令使用国满意的，在他看来，埃及的宣言对将来提供了一切必要的保证。他只希望巴拿马运河等其它水道的管理工作能够像今天的苏伊士运河一样令人满意。
    在会上发言的还有古巴、澳大利亚和菲律宾的代表。
    理事会下次会议在5月21日举行。
