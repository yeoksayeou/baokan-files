Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 20th: According to a Colombo dispatch from the Indian newspaper Trust of India: Indian Prime Minister Nehru and Ceylon Prime Minister Bandaranaike today issued a “sincere and urgent appeal demanding an immediate halt to such test explosions until atomic and thermonuclear test explosions are completely abolished."

The two Prime Ministers, in a joint statement issued in Colombo, said that such a cessation would not only help ease international tensions, but would also prompt effective consideration of the issue of disarmament.

The statement said that the two Prime Ministers were “concerned about the harmful and unpredictable radioactive effects on mankind caused by the continued explosion of atomic and thermonuclear weapons by the Soviet Union, the United States and the United Kingdom for testing purposes.” They expressed regret that the major powers concerned had not decided to stop their “dangerous actions” in this regard.

The statement said, “They reaffirm their adherence to the Five Principles of International Relations, namely, Panchsheel, as embodied and developed by the Bandung Conference. They are convinced that if these principles are followed in the spirit in which they were intended, it would be possible to build cooperation, understanding and friendship between nations (many of which have ideological and other differences). This attitude will also ease world tensions and help avoid the serious conflicts that threaten the world today.”

The two Prime Ministers were comforted and satisfied by the normal navigation of the Suez Canal. However, they were "deeply concerned about the situation in certain parts of the Middle East." The statement said, "The problems in this region can only be resolved by allowing the people of the countries in this region to freely determine their own destiny according to their wishes. Forcibly establishing diplomatic power will only perpetuate tensions and exacerbate these problems."

The statement said that the two Prime Ministers recognized the importance of the United Nations as an instrument for world peace. In order to play an effective role, the United Nations must have full representation representing the world family. The United Nations' failure to recognize the People's Republic of China not only violates the basic principles of the Charter, but also undermines the role of the United Nations."

The two Prime Ministers congratulated the people of Ghana on their independence and looked forward to the independence of the people of Malaya.

The two Prime Ministers believed that the area of freedom would expand, and that countries still under colonial rule would soon gain their freedom. They strongly opposed all aggression and attempts to reimpose “any form of colonialism or imperialism” on the people.

    印锡两国总理发出紧急呼吁
    要求立即停止核武器试验
    重申忠于万隆会议原则　主张联合国接纳中国
    据新华社新德里20日电　据印度报业托辣斯科伦坡消息：印度总理尼赫鲁和锡兰总理班达拉奈克今天发出“恳切的和紧急的呼吁，要求在原子核和热核试验爆炸完全取消以前立即停止这种试验爆炸”。
    两国总理在科伦坡发表的联合声明中说，这样的停止不但会有助于缓和国际紧张局势，而且会促使对裁军问题进行有效的考虑。
    声明说，两国总理“关心到苏联、美国和联合王国为试验目的继续爆炸原子核和热核武器而对人类造成的有害的和无法预测的放射作用影响的当前直接后果”。他们对有关的大国还没有决定停止它们在这方面的“危险行动”表示遗憾。
    声明说，“他们重申他们忠实于关于国际关系的五项原则，即为万隆会议通过的原则所体现并且发挥的潘查希拉。他们确信，如果按着这些原则的精神办事，那就会有可能建立各国之间的合作、谅解和友谊，（这些国家当中的许多国家有着意识形态的和其他的分歧。）这种态度也将缓和世界紧张局势，并且有助于避免在今天威胁着世界的严重的冲突。”
    两国总理对于苏伊士运河正常通航感到安慰和满意。但是他们对于“西亚某些地方的情况深感忧虑。”声明说，“这个地区的问题只有通过让这个地区的国家的人民根据他们的愿望自由解决他们自己命运的办法才能解决。要是强行建立外交界的权力就只会使紧张局势不断存在下去，使这些问题尖锐化。”
    声明说，两国总理承认联合国作为争取世界和平的工具的重要性。为了发挥有效的作用，联合国必须具有代表世界大家庭的充分代表性。联合国没有承认中华人民共和国不仅违反宪章的基本原则，并且还损害了联合国的作用。”
    两国总理祝贺加纳人民获得独立，并且期望马来亚人民也获得独立。
    两国总理相信，自由地区将会扩大，并且仍然处于殖民统治之下的国家不久将获得他们的自由。他们强烈地反对一切侵略和把“任何形式的殖民主义或帝国主义”重新强加于人民的企图。
