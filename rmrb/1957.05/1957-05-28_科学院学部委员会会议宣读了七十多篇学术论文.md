    In the past four days, scientists from the Academy of Sciences, universities, and industrial departments have presented over seventy academic papers at the Second Plenary Meeting of the Academic Committee of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The authors of the papers include internationally renowned senior scientists such as Ye Zhubei, Zhang Xiangtong, Yang Zhongjian, Feng Youlan, Pei Wenzhong, Chen Jiangu, and Hua Luogeng, as well as young people in their twenties. Many are also scientists who have returned from countries such as the United States, Britain, and the Netherlands in recent years.
    Wang Fangming, a teacher in the Philosophy Department of Renmin University of China, in his paper "On the Inherent Nature and Proper Status of Classical Formal Logic," answered a question that had arisen in philosophical and logical circles: Is classical logic in line with or in violation of Marxism-Leninism? What role does it play in the practical lives of people who take dialectical materialism as their worldview? The paper stated that classical formal logic is the science that studies the logical forms of quantitative aspects of linguistic thinking. People seize on the point that "thinking reflects existence" to deny logical form, believing that this is thinking detached from existence. In fact, this is just a one-sidedly severing of the Marxist view of thinking, and is just using metaphysical materialism to oppose the dialectical materialist study of thinking, evading the responsibility of conducting a scientific analysis of the scientific fact of logical form in accordance with dialectical materialism. Metaphysical materialism is a more cunning enemy of materialist dialectics. Of course, exaggerating and distorting logical form, and thinking that it is a fabrication of people's will, is an idealistic point of view. The paper believes that classical formal logic is like mathematics which studies the quantity of objective things. It is a concrete science that studies the quantitative aspects of thinking; its theoretical foundation can be idealistic or materialistic, and it can be metaphysical or dialectical. We must provide it with a dialectical materialist theoretical foundation; classical formal logic is an independent science, it cannot become philosophy, and once it becomes philosophy, it is metaphysics, and it cannot be mixed with inductive logic. Mixing them together will harm both sides. Language is developing, and the logical phenomena of language must also be developing, and classical formal logic will develop with the development of linguistic thinking.
    Metallurgical and chemical expert Ye Zhubei's "New Concepts in Blast Furnace Ironmaking" theoretically explains the superiority of using steam injection and high-pressure furnace top combined operation methods from the new perspectives of blast furnace heat balance and fluid mechanics. According to Ye Zhubei's estimation, the adoption of this combined operation method can increase blast furnace productivity by about one time. Scientists have given high praise to this paper, especially scientists in industrial departments.
    Chen Zongji, a soil mechanics expert who returned from the Netherlands in 1955, reported on "Some New Views on Soil Mechanics," analyzed the experimental methods of soil mechanics, and pointed out that if a thorough and in-depth understanding of the mechanical behavior of soil is required, the general methods of testing soil mechanics currently used in China are not suitable, and these methods cannot solve China's unique problems, such as the loess problem, and the subsidence of factory foundations in Northwest industrial construction. Chen Zongji introduced some soil mechanics testing principles based on modern rheological viewpoints, and he believes that only by using the latest research methods can some problems in China's unique soil mechanics be solved.
    Zhang Xiangtong, a physiologist who returned from the United States half a year ago, presented a paper on the cyclical circuit between the cerebral cortex and the thalamus. His exploratory research on this issue, which is not yet fully understood in the international physiological community, not only has important significance for the interpretation of brain waves, but also involves the view of the entire neurology. Based on the results of his experimental research using electrophysiological methods, Zhang Xiangtong put forward a new view: the central nervous system must be regarded as a complex composed of countless neuron chains, with close interrelationships between various parts, just like the most complex automated electronic instrument, in which signals generated in one part will be transmitted to another part along various lines, and at the same time can return to the original location along the feedback line to achieve the effect of strengthening and inhibiting, and finally complete a task. He believes that in the past, physiologists, pharmacologists, and neurologists often liked to divide the central nervous system into upper and lower stages, thinking that a certain function, a certain lesion, or the effect of a certain drug belonged to the cerebral cortex stage or the thalamus stage. This concept is not very correct. Domestic and foreign biologists attending the meeting were very interested in this paper. Many people basically agreed with Zhang Xiangtong's views, and at the same time raised many questions, which Zhang Xiangtong answered.
    Atomic nuclear physicist Zhang Wenyu reported on his research on V° particles through observation and calculation in his paper "Using a Double-Plate Cloud Chamber to Study the Production and Decay of V° Particles." Aerodynamicist Guo Yonghuai's paper "Problems in Modern High-Speed Aerodynamics" introduced the formation and performance of shock waves, the principle and use of a new type of experimental instrument used to generate shock waves—the shock tube, and some physical problems in high-speed airflow. When aircraft, rockets, and other flying bodies fly too fast, shock waves with high pressure and high temperature are generated at the front end. The appearance of shock waves brings some adverse effects to the flying body. However, in recent years, due to the rapid development of high-speed aerodynamics, the destructive power of shock waves has been used to study the changes in air between two thousand and ten thousand degrees absolute temperature.
    Mathematician Wu Wenjun reported on the "Realization Problem in Euclidean Space," including the part of his research that won the 1956 Science Award, as well as the results he continued to research after the award. Mathematician Hua Luogeng reported on "Some Results on Additive Prime Number Theory." Hua Luogeng has conducted many years of research on additive prime number theory, and this paper introduces his recent research in this area. Young mathematicians Gu Chaohao, Wang Yuan, Feng Kang, and Xia Daoxing respectively presented their papers on generalized differential geometry, analytical number theory, generalized function theory, and univalent function theory.
    In addition, many papers were presented in history, economics, linguistics, chemistry, and earth sciences.
    Scientists Meng Zhaoying, Wu Zhonghua, and Zhang Zuomei, who recently visited the Soviet Union, respectively introduced the latest scientific and technological developments in the Soviet Union in the fields of radio electronics, gas turbines, automation and remote control technology, and titanium metallurgy at the meeting of the Department of Technical Sciences.

    科学院学部委员会会议宣读了七十多篇学术论文
    本报特约新华社稿　最近四天来，科学院、高等学校和产业部门的科学家在中国科学院学部委员会第二次全体会议上宣读了七十多篇学术论文。论文的作者，有蜚声国际的叶渚沛、张香桐、杨锺健、冯友兰、裴文中、陈建功、华罗庚等老一辈的科学家，也有二十多岁的年轻人。还有许多是近年从美国、英国、荷兰等国归来的科学家。
    中国人民大学哲学系教师王方名的论文“论古典形式逻辑的固有性质和应有地位”，回答了哲学界和逻辑学界产生的一个问题：古典逻辑是合乎还是违反马克思列宁主义？它对于以辩证唯物主义作为世界观的人民生活实践，有何作用？论文说，古典形式逻辑是研究语言思维的量的方面的逻辑形式的科学。人们抓住“思维反映存在”这一点否认逻辑形式，认为这是思维脱离存在，其实这刚好是片面割裂马克思主义的思维观，刚好是用唯物主义的形而上学反对辩证唯物主义对思维的研究，逃避了对逻辑形式这一科学事实进行合于辩证唯物主义的科学分析的责任，唯物主义的形而上学是唯物辩证法的更巧妙的敌人。当然夸大并歪曲逻辑形式，认为它是人们意志的臆造，这是唯心主义的观点。论文认为古典形式逻辑就像数学之研究客观事物的量一样，它是研究思维的量的方面的具体科学；它的理论基础既可以是唯心的或唯物的，又可能是形而上学的或辩证法的，我们必须为它提供辩证唯物主义的理论基础；古典形式逻辑是一门独立科学、它不可以成为哲学，一成为哲学就是形而上学，它又不可以同归纳逻辑搅拌在一起，搅在一起就损害了双方；语言是发展的，语言的逻辑现象也必然是发展的，古典形式逻辑将随着语言思维的发展而发展。
    冶金化工专家叶渚沛的“高炉炼铁新观念”，从高炉热能平衡和流体力学的新观点，从理论上阐明了用蒸气喷射和高压炉顶联合操作法的优越性。据叶渚沛的估计，采用这个联合操作法，可使高炉生产率提高约一倍。科学家们对这篇论文的评价很高，特别是产业部门的科学家。
    1955年从荷兰回国的土壤力学家陈宗基报告的“关于土力学的若干新观点”，对土壤力学的试验方法作了分析，并且指出，如果要对土壤的力学行为进行彻底深入的了解，现在国内应用的一般检验土力的方法是不适用的，这些方法不能解决中国特有的问题：如黄土问题、西北工业建设中的厂房地基下陷等问题。陈宗基介绍了一些基于现代流变学观点的土力试验原则，他认为只有采用最新的研究方法，才能解决中国特有土壤力学方面的一些问题。
    半年前从美国归来的生理学家张香桐提出了一篇关于大脑皮质和丘脑间的循回线路的论文。他对这项国际生理学界尚不十分明了的问题所作的探索性研究，不仅对脑电波的解释有着重要的意义，而且涉及对整个神经学的看法。张香桐根据他用电生理学的方法实验研究的结果，提出了一个新的见解：必须把中央神经系统看成为一个由无数神经原连锁构成的一个综体，各个部分之间都有密切的相互关系，正同一架最复杂的自动化电子仪器一样，其中某一部分发生的信号会沿着各种线路传达到另一部分，同时又能沿着反哺线路，返回原处，以达到加强和抑制的作用，最后完成一个任务。他认为，过去生理学家、药物学家、神经病学家往往喜欢把中央神经系统划分为上下几个阶段，认为某种机能，某种病变，或某种药物的作用是属于大脑皮质阶段的或是丘脑阶段的，这个概念是不十分正确的。到会的国内外生物学家们对这篇论文兴趣很大。许多人基本上同意张香桐的见解，同时提出了许多疑问，张香桐作了解答。
    原子核物理学家张文裕在他的论文“用双板云箱来研究V°粒子之产生和衰变”中，报告了他通过观测和计算、对V°这种基本粒子所作的研究。空气动力学家郭永怀的论文
  “现代高速空气动力学中的问题”，介绍了冲击波的形成和性能、用以产生冲击波的新式试验仪器——冲击波管的原理和用途，高速气流里的一些物理问题。飞机、火箭等飞体在飞行得太快时，在前端便产生了压力很大的冲击波和很高的温度，冲击波的出现给飞体带来一些不利的影响。但是，近几年来由于高速空气动力学的迅速发展，冲击波的破坏性被利用来研究空气在两千到一万度绝对温度间的变化。
    数学家吴文俊就“在欧氏空间中的实现问题”作了报告，内容包括他的这项研究中获得1956年度科学奖金的部分，以及在评奖以后他继续研究得到的成果。数学家华罗庚报告了“关于堆垒素数论的一些结果”。华罗庚对堆垒素数论进行过多年的研究，这篇论文介绍了他近年来在这方面所作的研究。青年数学家谷超豪、王元、冯康、夏道行等，分别在广义微分几何、解析数论、广义函数论和单叶函数论方面宣读了他们的论文。
    此外，历史学、经济学、语言学、化学、地学等学科都提出了不少论文。
    不久前访问苏联回来的科学家孟昭英、吴仲华、张作梅等在技术科学部的会议上分别介绍了苏联发展无线电电子学、燃气轮、自动化及远距离控制技术、钛冶金等最新科学技术的近况。
