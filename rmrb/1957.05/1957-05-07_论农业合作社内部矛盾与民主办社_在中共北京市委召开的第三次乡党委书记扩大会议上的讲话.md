On Internal Contradictions and Democratic Management of Agricultural Cooperatives
    —Speech at the Third Enlarged Conference of Township Party Committee Secretaries Convened by the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China
    Deng Zihui, Minister of the Rural Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
    Editor's Note: From April 16th to 21st, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China convened an enlarged conference of township Party committee secretaries to examine and summarize the great achievements and newly emerging problems in the first year after the completion of the socialist transformation of agriculture in the suburbs, and based on the Party Central Committee's notice on three matters of democratic management of cooperatives, the spirit of the directives of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on doing a good job in spring plowing and striving for a bumper agricultural harvest in 1957, focused on discussing important issues such as democratic management of cooperatives. During the conference, Deng Zihui, Minister of the Rural Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, attended and gave a speech, focusing on analyzing six relatively prominent contradictions in the current rural areas, and pointed out that vigorously implementing the policy of democratic management of cooperatives is the most fundamental way to solve these contradictions. What follows is the full text of Comrade Deng Zihui's speech.
    I fully agree with the Municipal Committee's assessment of the achievements of the work in the Beijing suburbs last year. In the high tide of agricultural cooperation and the subsequent development of the high tide of agricultural production, the suburbs of Beijing played a leading role in the country. The achievements of rural work last year were huge and primary, and this must be affirmed. We cannot lower our estimate of the achievements because there are some shortcomings in our work. However, on the other hand, we must admit that our work still had shortcomings during the high tide. Although many of these shortcomings were unavoidable, we must humbly examine them and analyze their causes, and be determined to overcome them. We cannot cover up our shortcomings with our achievements, as this will not benefit our future work, but will be harmful. We must estimate our achievements, criticize our shortcomings, and improve our work based on a realistic attitude. This is my view and suggestion on the work in the Beijing suburbs last year, for the reference of comrades.
    Now I would like to take this opportunity to talk to you about the following issues:
    I. Internal Contradictions of Agricultural Cooperatives and Solutions
    In the past, the class contradiction between landlords and peasants existed in China's rural areas for a long time. This contradiction has been resolved through the victory of the Liberation War and the completion of land reform. After the land reform, new contradictions arose in the rural areas, that is, the contradiction between individual farmers taking the capitalist road or the socialist road. After several years of struggle and hard work, agricultural cooperation was basically realized throughout the country last year, and Chinese farmers definitely embarked on the socialist road, thus basically resolving the contradiction between the two roads. So are there still contradictions now? There are contradictions. The new contradiction now is the contradiction within the people, as Chairman Mao said. According to the experience of rectifying cooperatives in various provinces, this kind of contradiction can be summarized into the following six types in terms of agricultural cooperatives:
    First, the contradiction between the state and the cooperative. This contradiction may be encountered in the formulation of agricultural production plans, the implementation of unified purchase and sale of agricultural products, the determination of prices for agricultural and industrial products, the deployment of agricultural product processing industries, and the determination of tax rates and collection methods for agricultural and sideline industries. The policy for resolving these contradictions was laid down in principle in the "Instructions on Strengthening the Production Leadership and Organizational Construction of Agricultural Production Cooperatives" issued by the Party Central Committee and the State Council on September 12 last year, which has made principled provisions on some issues in this regard. Over the past year, various localities have been implementing these principles and have created many ways to solve specific problems. However, these contradictions have not been completely resolved, and we need to take further specific measures to implement the Central Committee's instructions in order to ease and even resolve these contradictions, and further consolidate the worker-peasant alliance economically.
    Second, the contradiction between the cooperative and its members, which is also the contradiction between the collective interests and individual interests of the members. In terms of product distribution, this is reflected in "less deduction and more distribution" or "more deduction and less distribution." During the summer harvest distribution last year, the Central Committee instructed all localities to adhere to the principle of "less deduction and more distribution," and instructed that 60%-70% of the total income of the cooperative should be given to the members, striving for increased income for 90% of the members. Now it seems that this is the correct policy for resolving the contradiction between the cooperative and its members, and this policy must continue to be implemented in the future. Of course, some cooperatives with bumper harvests last year mechanically implemented this policy, even failing to retain what should have been retained and deduct what should have been deducted, which affected this year's production. This kind of mechanical practice should be avoided.
    Another manifestation of the contradiction between the cooperative and its members is whether sideline production should be completely concentrated by the cooperative or distributed by the members. The Central Committee's instruction is: "Everything that is conducive to decentralized management should be encouraged and helped by the members' families to manage on their own as much as possible, except for those that must be collectively managed by the cooperative." This instruction corrected the bias of concentrating all sideline production in the cooperative and restricting members from engaging in sideline occupations, which is an important measure to resolve the contradiction between the cooperative and its members. However, in the implementation, some areas once generated the tendency to assign sideline production that should not be managed by individuals to individual management, thus increasing this contradiction. This bias must also be corrected. Recently, Jiangsu Province has established three principles for dividing the scope of collective and individual management of sideline industries: (1) Large-scale operations are managed by the cooperative, and small-scale operations are managed by the team or members; (2) Highly profitable operations are managed by the cooperative, and less profitable operations are managed by the team or members; (3) Critical sideline industries (such as raising boars and sows) are managed by the cooperative, and non-critical ones are managed by the team or members. These methods can be used as a reference for various localities.
    Third, the contradiction between the cooperative and the production team, which is one that urgently needs to be resolved at present. Generally speaking, last year, cooperatives in various localities over-concentrated power in the hands of the cooperative management committee. They managed production plans, technical measures, labor quotas, and financial work in excessive detail and too rigidly. The production teams had no power to maneuver, so they could not adapt to the time and local conditions, and thus could not give full play to the enthusiasm of the production teams and all members. This phenomenon of excessive concentration of power and excessive management must be overcome in a timely manner. The "appropriate division of power between the cooperative and the team" and the implementation of the "unified management and decentralized management" system currently created in various localities are the main ways to resolve this contradiction.
    Fourth, the contradiction between cooperative members, which is mainly reflected in the contradiction between middle peasants and poor peasants. For example, the valuation of livestock, carts, forests, and fruit trees when they joined the cooperative was too low, and the payments could not be returned on schedule. These problems caused dissatisfaction among the upper-middle peasants, but improper handling would also lead to dissatisfaction among the poor peasants. Upper-middle peasants are working people, basic masses, and our targets for unity. The contradiction between poor and middle peasants is one of the internal contradictions of the people. At present, in handling such problems, we should conduct persuasive education work on both sides on the basis of consolidating the advantages of poor peasants, and make necessary and appropriate concessions to upper-middle peasants economically, so as not to infringe on the interests of upper-middle peasants. For example, if the valuation of livestock and carts joining the cooperative was too low according to the current price, it should be appropriately adjusted; livestock and carts that members pull on foot can be assigned to the original owners for transportation after joining the cooperative, and appropriate consideration should be given in terms of work points. The discounted amount should be returned on schedule. If it is impossible to repay the loan for a long time, the "principal-guaranteed and fixed-interest" method can be adopted. Because the valuation of fruit trees and forests joining the cooperative is difficult to be accurate, and the cooperative cannot repay the loan, it is most appropriate to change it to a proportional dividend system. This will not only reduce a lot of trouble, but also avoid the danger of indiscriminate felling of trees. Some cooperatives in Guangdong Province have assigned orchards to the original owners to operate at their own expense, and the cooperative only extracts a certain proportion of the annual output value as public accumulation fund and public welfare fund. This method can also be used as a reference for various localities. In these specific issues, the situation in the Beijing suburbs has its own characteristics, and the solutions may be different from other places, so there is no need to copy them. However, we should pay attention to studying this issue, and strive to resolve the contradiction between poor and middle peasants, and achieve the goal of unity between poor and middle peasants.
    Another manifestation of the contradiction between members is the contradiction between strong and weak labor, high and low skills, those engaged in agricultural labor and non-agricultural labor (such as handicrafts, small vendors, etc.), overspending households and deposit households. This mainly requires appropriate arrangements for members with weak labor, non-agricultural labor, and overspending households in the annual work plan. We must use their strengths and enable them to get what they want and increase their income. Those with high skills should be given appropriate consideration in terms of work points. The five-guarantee households and households in difficulty should be taken care of from the public welfare fund. There is a principle here, that is, the distribution principle of the cooperative is basically based on work, but appropriate care should be given to those without labor, weak labor, and households in difficulty based on the principle of mutual assistance and mutual benefit.
    Fifth, the contradiction between production teams, mainly the contradiction between poor villages and rich villages (that is, poor teams and rich teams). The so-called rich villages and rich teams refer to those with better land, higher yields, or more fruit trees and forests. This is the result of better natural conditions and years of hard work by farmers, rather than exploitation. Some cooperatives have not given proper consideration to rich villages and distributed income equally throughout the cooperative, resulting in losses for the members of rich villages and rich teams, causing their dissatisfaction and even causing antagonism between villages and teams, aggravating this contradiction, which is not right. The way to deal with this contradiction is to give appropriate consideration in the contracted output, so that they do not suffer losses or suffer little losses, so as to facilitate unity. Poor villages and poor teams should be helped in production to gradually increase their output and catch up with rich villages and rich teams within a certain period of time.
    Sixth, the contradiction between cadres and the masses. Most of our grassroots cadres are good in nature, and they are in contact with the broad masses of farmers. However, many cadres generally lack democratic style, do not consult with members when encountering problems, do not ask veteran farmers for advice, and the members' representative assembly is not held on schedule. The cooperative cadres only unilaterally so-called responsible to the higher authorities and listen to the higher authorities, and do not know how to be responsible to the masses and listen to the opinions of the masses, often opposing the two, and do not follow the mass line. Some cooperative cadres also have serious coercive and commanding behavior, do not participate in production themselves, subsidize too many work points, do not make the accounts public, and even have corruption and embezzlement. Of course, this causes dissatisfaction among the members and the masses, and the problem is even more serious in cooperatives with reduced production. The accumulation of this dissatisfaction leads to the opposition between the members and the cadres, and even leads to phenomena such as withdrawal from the cooperative and quarrels. Obviously, if this contradiction is not properly resolved, it will dissipate the established advantage of the poor peasants and make the cooperative unconsolidated. The measures stipulated in the notice on three matters of democratic management of cooperatives issued by the Central Committee in March this year are timely and effective remedies for resolving this contradiction. The recent transfer of cadres, participation of cooperative cadres in production, respect for veteran farmers, and public announcement of accounts are the basic reasons for the recent new atmosphere in rural areas and the gradual normalization of the relationship between cadres and the masses.
    In addition, there are contradictions between agricultural cooperatives and supply and marketing cooperatives and credit cooperatives, especially contradictions between agricultural cooperatives and handicraft cooperatives. Although the Central Committee's instructions last year put forward the policy of taking into account both urban and rural areas and making overall arrangements, and stipulated the principle of division of labor between agricultural cooperatives and handicraft cooperatives, these contradictions have not been well resolved and need to be studied in the future and further work to resolve these contradictions.
    II. On Democratic Management of Cooperatives
    From the above six contradictions, it can be seen that after the elimination of classes in our country's rural areas, new contradictions have emerged after the resolution of old contradictions. The existence of contradictions within the people is in line with objective facts and the laws of social development. If these contradictions can be discovered in a timely manner and resolved rationally, we will be able to unite the broad masses of farmers, further develop productive forces, consolidate the cooperative, and give full play to the superiority of the cooperative system. However, if we cover up or ignore these contradictions and talk emptily about the superiority of the cooperative system, then these contradictions will still exist and develop. As a result, we will become divorced from the masses, stifle the enthusiasm of the masses, hinder or even reverse the development of productive forces, affect the consolidation of the cooperative, and ultimately make the superiority of the cooperative system unable to be exerted or even be offset. This is also the inevitable law of the development of objective things. Therefore, our task is to discover these contradictions in a timely manner and resolve these contradictions in a timely manner. We must analyze the root causes of these contradictions and study solutions. We must analyze which contradictions are major, which are minor, which are the most prominent, which contradictions have been resolved, which are being resolved, and which have not yet found a solution; and then take effective measures to gradually resolve these contradictions. Of course, after one contradiction is resolved, new contradictions will emerge. We must continuously improve our work and resolve contradictions. Only in this way can we develop production, consolidate the cooperative, consolidate our unity with the peasants, and further give full play to the superiority of the cooperative system.
    How do we resolve these internal contradictions of the people? We must implement the policies instructed by Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, that is, we must mobilize the masses, distinguish right from wrong, persist in what is right, and correct what is wrong through criticism and education, starting from unity, to achieve new unity. In a word, we must conscientiously implement the policy of democratic management of cooperatives.
    What does democratic management of cooperatives mean? It means taking the people as the masters, and in agricultural cooperatives, it means taking the peasants as the masters, and it means implementing the mass line leadership method. The cooperative leads agricultural production, and doing a good job in agricultural production can run the cooperative well and consolidate the cooperative. So, who can do a good job in agricultural production? Can we rely only on a few cooperative cadres without relying on the broad masses of members? Can we rely only on the guidance of the higher authorities without relying on the enthusiasm and creativity of the peasants? In terms of technical measures, can we rely only on the guidance of technicians without summarizing and promoting the practical experience of the peasants? Of course not. To do a good job in agricultural production, close cooperation is needed on both sides, that is, both members and cadres are needed, both the enthusiasm of members and the correct guidance of the higher authorities are needed, and both the practical experience of peasants and the scientific knowledge of technicians are needed. However, which of these two aspects is the most important? Obviously, the enthusiasm, creativity, and practical experience of the broad masses of peasant members are the most important. So, are cadres, technicians, and higher-level instructions unimportant? No, we cannot look at the problem in such an antagonistic way, but we must combine the two, which is the mass line leadership method that combines leadership and the masses, concentration and democracy, theory and practice. As everyone knows, the reason why our Party has won the victory in the Chinese revolution and achieved success in all aspects of work is that there is a fundamental line, which is the mass line. The Central Committee has long pointed out that "the task of the leaders is to come up with ideas and use cadres." Who should come up with ideas? Chairman Mao also clearly instructed long ago: "Concentrate the opinions of the masses (scattered and unsystematic opinions) (after research, transform them into concentrated and systematic opinions), and then go to the masses to publicize and explain them, transform them into the opinions of the masses, so that the masses persist in them, see them in action, and test whether these opinions are correct in the actions of the masses. Then concentrate them from the masses again, and then persist in them to the masses. So infinitely cycle, once more correct, more vivid, and richer than the last." This is Chairman Mao's clearest and most specific instruction on the mass line leadership method. From this, it can be seen that the ideas of the leaders are not imagined by the leading cadres sitting at home based on their own subjective imagination, but rely on cadres going deep into the masses, consulting with the masses, listening to the opinions of the masses, collecting the opinions of the masses of all aspects and strata, analyzing, comparing, taking, and summarizing them into more comprehensive opinions, and then becoming the opinions of the masses through the representative assembly, and then leading the masses to persist in them through the cadres. Such ideas are not the ideas of individuals, but the collective ideas of the masses, not relying solely on the wisdom of individuals, but on the collective wisdom of the broad masses. The power and knowledge of individuals are always limited, while the power and knowledge of the masses are endless. A leader, even if he has any great talent, is only one person. If he does not combine with the masses, then the ideas will not be good and things will not be done well. However, if this leader can combine with the masses and rely on the collective power and collective wisdom of the broad masses, then the ideas must be more in line with the actual situation, and things can be done better. Even if the ideas are biased and things are not done well, the masses will not complain about the leaders. Combining leadership with the masses and following the mass line is the fundamental line of the Party in leading all work. Agricultural cooperatives lead farmers to do a good job in agricultural production, and they should rely more on farmers and follow the mass line. Whether it is production plans, technical measures, grouping and team formation, contracting work and output, labor quotas, absorbing investment, product distribution, etc., cooperative cadres should consult with members and ask veteran farmers for advice, and then make decisions through the management committee and the representative assembly, and rely on members to implement them. Of course, state plans and higher-level instructions should be implemented, but when implementing them, they should also be adapted to local conditions and make flexible adjustments based on the specific circumstances and possible conditions at the time, and should not be blindly implemented. Technicians understand general agricultural science knowledge, and this knowledge is very valuable, but it should be affirmed that technicians do not have as much practical knowledge as farmers. The general scientific knowledge that technicians have learned in textbooks may not fully conform to the specific circumstances of each place. Therefore, the responsibility of technicians is not to prescribe rigid procedures to guide farmers to implement them, but to humbly learn from local experienced veteran farmers and horticulturists, consult with local farmers, study the original experience of various places, summarize and improve them, and then promote them locally. Generally speaking, advanced experience from outside should be promoted after key or multi-point trials. That is to say, in technical measures, we must also implement the mass line of coming from the masses and going to the masses, which is called combining theory and practice. Any technician who does this will help agricultural production and be welcomed by farmers, and the technician himself will easily improve; otherwise, it will be counterproductive. In short, to resolve internal contradictions of cooperatives, run cooperatives well, and do a good job in agricultural production, we must realize democratic management of cooperatives and follow the mass line. The masses are the source of all power, cadres are the bridge connecting the Party and the masses, the masses are the masters, and cadres are the orderlies who serve the people. Cadres must stand among the masses, not above the masses. I hope all comrades deeply understand these few words.
    So, how can we implement democratic management of cooperatives and follow the mass line? I think the main links are to open up the thinking of cadres and let go of mobilizing the masses. In summarizing the work of the past year, according to the Central Committee's notice in April, we should conduct education on democratic management of cooperatives and the mass line to the broad masses of cadres. On the other hand, we should also launch practical democratic life for the masses at appropriate times after full preparation. Meet their urgent democratic requirements, so that they can speak freely and express various opinions without any worries; and then guide them to understand how to correctly exercise their democratic rights, and cultivate their democratic habits. And through democratic education and practice, cultivate the mass viewpoint of cooperative cadres, cultivate their democratic spirit and democratic style of caring about the lives of members and the masses everywhere, consulting with the masses when encountering problems, and treating people equally. In particular, cadres must personally go to the fields to participate in production, work with the masses, share weal and woe, and make their lives mass-oriented, not special.
    Cultivating the democratic spirit and democratic style of cadres and meeting the urgent democratic requirements of the masses are prerequisites for realizing democratic management of cooperatives. But is that enough? No, we must also establish the democratic system of the cooperative on this basis. There are many kinds of democratic systems, but the most important systems should be the following:
    First, hold members' representative assemblies well. The members' assembly is the highest authority of the cooperative and should be held on schedule. However, since our agricultural cooperatives realized advancedization last year, they have generally been large in scale, with small ones having hundreds of households and large ones having hundreds or thousands of households. Take a small cooperative with hundreds of households, with an average of two members per household, a members' assembly would have more than one or two hundred people. Such a members' mass assembly can only be used for propaganda and education and dissemination of resolutions, but cannot be relied upon to study problems and solve problems. Therefore, a members' representative assembly system must be established, with the representative assembly as the highest authority of the cooperative. All major issues must be submitted to the representative assembly for discussion and approval. The management committee only implements the resolutions of the representative assembly and cannot exceed the authority stipulated in the cooperative charter. This is the most basic democratic system of the cooperative. The production team is the basic production unit of the cooperative. If the team is large and the number of members attending the meeting is too large, a representative meeting system should also be established. In order to facilitate the representatives to fully express their opinions and discuss issues, the number of representatives should not be too large. Generally, the number of representatives of a cooperative should be appropriate at two or thirty to three or forty, and the number of representatives of a team should be appropriate at about ten, not exceeding twenty. Too many representatives are like holding a mass meeting, which is difficult to promote democracy and speak fully. The composition of representatives should be broad, with representatives of poor and lower-middle peasants, representatives of upper-middle peasants, representatives of young adults and women, and representatives of the elderly, so that they can represent the opinions of all levels and aspects. How should the list of representative candidates be proposed? According to the experience of various places, it is better to first deliberate among the members of each team and propose it jointly by a certain number of members. Efforts should be made to avoid the nomination method of the branch. The branch nomination should be carried out by party members in the masses with member qualifications, and proposed according to the prescribed number of people and procedures. The meeting time of the representative assembly should not be too long, so it is not appropriate to discuss too many issues. It is best to discuss one issue at a time. At the meeting, representatives should be allowed to fully express their opinions. Positive, negative, supportive, and opposed opinions should be expressed, and they can be expressed once or several times. Do not mechanically stipulate the rules of procedure.
    Second, regularly hold symposiums for veteran farmers and professional symposiums, and hire experienced veteran farmers and horticulturists as consultants. This should be used as a supplementary system to the representative assembly. Veteran farmers have been farming all their lives and have rich experience. Giving full play to and using the experience of veteran farmers and horticulturists is an important condition for doing a good job in agricultural production, and it is also an important method for strengthening internal unity and reducing internal contradictions.
    Third, implement the system of "unified management and decentralized management," which is the system of "decentralizing power and dividing power between cooperatives and teams" currently implemented in various localities. This is a new creation in various localities, and it is the best way to resolve the most prominent contradictions within the current cooperative (the contradiction between the cooperative and the team, the contradiction between the team and the team, and the contradiction between the cooperative and the members). It can also be said to be a new system of the cooperative. The "three guarantees" system and the "two indicators" "overproduction bonus" system implemented by some cooperatives in the Beijing suburbs are examples of this new system. The so-called "three guarantees" are guarantees of work, guarantees of output, and guarantees of cost (this cost does not include work points, but only includes seeds, fertilizers, agricultural tool repairs, pesticides, and treatment of livestock, which can also be called "guarantees of expenditure"). The so-called "two indicators" are that the planned indicator is higher than the normal actual output, and the guaranteed output indicator is lower than the normal actual output. The guaranteed output indicator of some cooperatives in the Beijing suburbs is equivalent to the "three fixed indicators," that is, 15%-20% lower than the normal actual output. This kind of guaranteed output indicator is appropriate. Some places also stipulate that the guaranteed output indicator will remain unchanged for three years. The so-called "overproduction bonus" is that when the actual output of the team exceeds the guaranteed output indicator, a certain percentage will be returned to the team for distribution as a reward. In the Beijing suburbs, it is divided into two-eight (20% for the cooperative and 80% for the team). In Henan and Jiangsu, it is divided into three-seven (in some places, labor days are awarded according to the proportion of overproduction, which is actually about 70% of the overproduction awarded to the team). This is a very good system. Due to the implementation of the "three guarantees" system, the production team must have certain powers. For example, although the production plan, technical measures, labor quotas, and expenditure limits are uniformly stipulated by the cooperative, the team must have a certain degree of flexibility in order to adapt to local conditions and adapt to the time. This is also very reasonable. Without this flexibility, it is difficult for the team to implement the "three guarantees." In addition to the appropriate decentralization of management power, the scope of sideline business should also be appropriately divided between the cooperative and the team. Of course, do not turn the teams into independent accounting units by increasing the power of the teams. Some cooperatives are too large in scale, and there are large teams between the cooperative and the team. Allowing large teams to establish their own financial systems, operate independently, and assume their own profits and losses, and become economic accounting units, actually becomes a branch of the cooperative. This is necessary and appropriate for large cooperatives. However, for most small and medium-sized cooperatives, it is unnecessary and inappropriate to let each team be responsible for its own profits and losses. It is best to convert overproduction bonuses into labor days for rewards (the model charter has this provision), and it is also possible to allow a portion of the grain to be divided as overproduction rewards when necessary. However, attention should be paid not to cause teams within the same cooperative to receive different remuneration for the same labor days, so as to cause disunity between teams. In short, "decentralizing power and dividing power between cooperatives and teams" is a new creation, a new system in the management of cooperatives, and a key system in the democratic management of cooperatives. According to the initial experience of various localities, the implementation of this system has the following benefits:
    (1) It can greatly give play to the enthusiasm and creativity of all members, because this overproduction bonus can enable members to get dividends and increase their income. In the past, there were also overproduction bonus methods in various places, but because the overproduction indicator and the planned indicator were the same indicator and were set very high, the members saw that it was difficult for their team to overproduce and that there was no bonus to divide, so of course their enthusiasm was much lower. Although after the increase in production, the members' income would increase after the cooperative's unified distribution, some members thought this way: there are hundreds of members in the entire cooperative, even if the production increases, it will only be divided into a few hundredths of one to myself, how much can I divide? With this in mind, the enthusiasm of the members will not be high, which is very natural. Now the guaranteed output indicator is lower than the normal actual output, and 70-80% of the overproduction is awarded to the team for distribution. The members see that there is output to overproduce, there is bonus to divide, and the team only has dozens of households. After calculating, the amount divided to themselves is not small, so of course their enthusiasm will be greatly improved, which is also very natural. Recently, wherever this has been done, a new atmosphere has emerged in various places, and the members are very enthusiastic about production, which is clear evidence. Some comrades doubt whether lowering the guaranteed output indicator and dividing overproduction will affect the public accumulation of the cooperative. In fact, it has no impact, because agricultural cooperatives are different from factories and state-owned farms. Factories and farms implement the wage system, and workers have a certain salary every month. If the contracted output is implemented and the contracted output indicator is set too low, the workers will get a share in addition to the fixed salary. From the workers' point of view, it is an increase in extra income, and from the state's point of view, it is a decrease in profit income. Therefore, the contracted output indicator of factories and farms cannot be set too low, which is very correct. However, cooperatives are different from factories and farms. Cooperatives implement the labor day system, not the wage system. In the past, production teams had no output to overproduce and no bonus to divide. The income of members was all derived from the contracted output portion of the cooperative. Now, the cooperative and the team share the income, and the members get income from two places: one is from the contracted output portion of the cooperative, and the other is from the overproduction bonus of the team. If the team is to get more overproduction rewards, the remuneration from the contracted output portion must be relatively reduced. The remuneration of the contracted output portion is not fixed, and the overproduction portion is not all obtained by the members, so the public accumulation of the cooperative will still not be reduced. On the contrary, due to the increased enthusiasm of the members and the increased output, the cooperative can also get 20-30% of the overproduction, so the public accumulation of the cooperative can sometimes increase relatively. Therefore, the concern that sharing the overproduction bonus will reduce public accumulation is unnecessary.
    (2) Problems can be discovered and solved in a timely manner in production management. Some cooperatives in Jiangsu implement the method of "contracting output to the team, contracting work to the group, and contracting field odds and ends to the household," while Henan implements "groups divide plots, households divide blocks, large jobs are done by everyone, and small jobs are done by themselves." This is a clear graded division of labor responsibility system, which unifies the two responsibility systems of output and labor quality. With this graded management, everyone has responsibility and power, which will make it easy to discover all problems that are not conducive to production and easy to solve. Last year, some cooperatives abandoned entire plots of land and did not know it, and the grain that was harvested rotted in the field and no one cared about it. This was the evil result of the cooperative's over-concentration of power and the lower levels having no responsibility or power.
    (3) It can reduce the clericalism, subjectivism, and bureaucratism of cooperative cadres. After decentralization of power, the functions and powers of cooperative teams are clearly divided. Matters that should be managed by the cooperative are requested from the cooperative, and matters that are managed by the team are handled by the team themselves, without bothering the cooperative cadres. In this way, the affairs of the cooperative cadres can be greatly reduced, and problems can be dealt with more timely and reasonably, and the mass line leadership method can be implemented. Cooperative cadres can also take more time to inspect the teams and can also take time to participate in production, thereby avoiding the problems of sitting in the office all day, being divorced from reality, and being divorced from the masses. At the same time, this can also reduce the number of full-time cadres in the cooperative, reduce work point subsidies, thereby increasing the income of members, and strengthen the close ties between cadres and the masses.
    (4) It can solve the contradiction between poor villages and rich villages and between poor teams and rich teams. For rich villages and rich teams that originally had better land, higher yields, and more fruit trees, appropriate consideration can be given to the guaranteed output indicator, so that they do not suffer too much loss. On this basis, and then with persuasive education, their resentment can be easily eliminated. Some people say that this is an excessive concession to the upper-middle peasants, and this statement is incorrect. I said above that the higher income of rich villages and rich teams is not derived from exploitation, so how can we say that all the members of rich villages and rich teams are upper-middle peasants? And how can we say that this is an excessive concession to the upper-middle peasants?
    Fourth, the establishment of a financial disclosure system is also an important system in the democratic management of cooperatives. In this regard, Jiangsu Province has recently made a new creation: on the one hand, checking accounts from the bottom up, that is, members elect representatives to check the team's accounts, and the team sends representatives to check the cooperative's accounts; on the other hand, checking accounts from the top down, that is, accounting counselors from various districts and townships convene accountants from each cooperative under their jurisdiction to bring their account books for mutual review. Combining these two account checking systems, and separating the cashier and the accountant from managing money and accounts, can reduce or even eliminate accounting chaos and corruption and embezzlement. These experiences can be used as a reference for various localities.
    III. On the Feeding and Management of Draft Animals
    For a considerable period of time, livestock will still be the main power of agricultural production in our country, and at the same time, they are also the source of fertilizers and livestock products. Therefore, developing animal husbandry, especially developing draft animals, is an extremely important issue in our agricultural production. Agriculture and animal husbandry are an inseparable whole that depends on each other and supports each other. They must be given equal importance and cannot be neglected. It is worth noting that the livestock in some provinces are very weak and die very seriously, and in many places, there is a phenomenon of people pulling plows. The Beijing suburbs may be better, but it is said that the weakness of livestock is also quite common. If this phenomenon is not changed, it may be a prelude to death. Therefore, we should also pay close attention to this issue and find a solution. Why is there a phenomenon of livestock dying and being weak? There are many reasons, such as insufficient feed, poor management, excessive use, the impact of disasters, and low prices for cowhide and beef, and old cows cannot be slaughtered. However, according to the situation in several provinces recently, the main reason for the weakness and death of livestock is still the over-concentration of feeding and management. For example, in the three provinces of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan, most of the livestock are managed centrally and fed in the same trough, and the weakness and death of livestock are more common. In the provinces south of the Yangtze River, such as Hunan, Hubei, Guangdong, and Fujian, most of the livestock are fed by members in a decentralized manner, and there is no death or very little death, and they have increased a lot. In Henan Province, 28 counties in Luoyang and Xinyang prefectures have more livestock fed in a decentralized manner, and there are fewer deaths, while other prefectures with centralized feeding have more deaths. What does this show? It shows that whether centralized feeding or decentralized feeding is a factor that plays a major role in whether livestock are weak and die. Why does centralized feeding increase the weakness and death of livestock? The reason is very simple. Livestock have different sizes, different physical strengths, good and bad tempers, and different speeds of eating grass. Decentralized feeding has nothing to do with each other, while centralized feeding makes it easy for the strong to bully the weak, the big to bully the small, and the fast eaters to eat their fill, while the slow eaters go hungry. In addition, some enclosures are too small, and many livestock are crowded together, fighting each other, resting insufficiently, and epidemics spread, which causes livestock to become weak and injured. In order to compete for work points, the members desperately use livestock

    论农业合作社内部矛盾与民主办社
    ——在中共北京市委召开的第三次乡党委书记扩大会议上的讲话
    中共中央农村工作部部长　邓子恢
    编者按　中共北京市委在4月16日到21日召开了乡党委书记扩大会议，检查和总结了郊区完成农业社会主义改造以后第一年的巨大成绩和新出现的问题，并根据党中央关于民主办社三个事项的通知、中共中央和国务院关于做好春耕工作争取1957年农业大丰收的指示等文件的精神，着重讨论了民主办社等重要问题。会议期间，中共中央农村工作部部长邓子恢曾到会讲话，着重分析了当前农村方面六种比较突出的矛盾，并指出大力贯彻执行民主办社方针是解决这些矛盾的最根本的方法。这里发表的是邓子恢同志这次讲话的全文。
    我完全同意市委关于京郊去年工作成绩的估计。在农业合作化高潮以及随后发展起来的农业生产高潮当中，北京郊区对全国都起了带头作用。去年农村工作的成绩是巨大的、是主要的，这一点必须肯定，不能因为工作中有一些缺点便降低对成绩的估计。但是，另一方面，必须承认在高潮当中我们的工作还有缺点，尽管这些缺点很多是难以避免的，我们也必须虚心地加以检查，并分析其原因，决心加以克服。不能因为成绩是主要的，便以此来掩盖自己的缺点，这样对我们今后工作并无好处，反而有害。我们必须本着实事求是的态度来估计成绩，批判缺点，改进工作。这便是我对京郊去年工作的看法和建议，提供同志们参考。
    现在我想乘此机会对同志们谈谈以下几个问题：
    一、农业合作社的内部矛盾和解决办法
    我国农村过去长期存在着地主和农民的阶级矛盾，这个矛盾经过了解放战争胜利和土地改革完成，已经解决了。土改之后，农村中又发生了新矛盾，这就是个体农民走向资本主义还是走向社会主义的矛盾。经过了几年来的斗争和艰苦工作，去年在全国范围内基本上实现了农业合作化，中国农民肯定地走上社会主义道路，从而基本上解决了这个两条道路的矛盾。那么现在还有没有矛盾呢？矛盾是有的，现在的新矛盾就是毛主席所说的人民内部的矛盾。根据各省整社的经验看来，这种矛盾表现在农业合作社方面的，可以综合为以下六种矛盾：
    第一，是国家和合作社的矛盾。在制订农业生产计划，实行农产品统购统销，规定农产品和工业品的价格，布置农产品加工业，以及规定农、副业的税率和征收办法等方面，都可能接触到这种矛盾。解决这些矛盾的方针，去年9月12日党中央与国务院颁布的“关于加强农业生产合作社的生产领导和组织建设的指示”，已经就这方面的若干问题作了原则的规定。一年来各地都在执行这些原则，并且创造许多解决具体问题的办法。但这些矛盾还未完全解决，我们还要进一步采取具体措施，贯彻执行中央指示，来缓和以至解决这些矛盾，从经济上进一步地巩固工农联盟。
    第二，是合作社与社员的矛盾，也是社员集体利益与个人利益的矛盾。这表现在产品分配问题上就是“少扣多分”、还是“多扣少分”。去年夏收分配时，中央指示要各地坚持“少扣多分”的原则，并指示要将社的总收入的60％—70％给社员，争取90％的社员增加收入。现在看来这是解决社与社员矛盾的正确方针，今后仍须贯彻执行这个方针。当然去年也有些丰收社机械执行这个方针，甚至该留的没有留，该扣的没有扣，影响到今年的生产，这种机械作法应该避免。
    社与社员矛盾在另一方面的表现，是副业生产由社完全集中经营还是由社员分散经营。中央指示的方针是：“必须集体经营的，可以由社统一经营外，一切利于分散经营的，应该尽可能鼓励和帮助社员家庭各自经营”。这个指示纠正了把副业生产一律集中到社，限制社员搞副业的偏向，这是解决社与社员矛盾的重要措施。但在执行中，某些地区曾一度产生把不应归个人经营的副业生产，也划归个人经营，因而就增加了这种矛盾。这一偏向也必须纠正。最近江苏省关于划分集体和个人经营副业的范围定了三条原则：（一）规模大的归社经营，规模小的归队或社员经营；（二）利特别大的归社经营，利较小的归队或社员经营；（三）关键性的副业（如养公猪、母猪等）归社经营；非关键性的归队或社员经营。这些办法可供各地参考。
    第三，是社与队的矛盾，这是目前最迫切需要解决的一个矛盾。一般说来，去年各地合作社都把权力过分集中到社管理委员会手里，无论生产计划、技术措施、劳动定额、财务工作等都管得过细过死，生产队无权机动，因此不能因时因地制宜，从而也就不能发挥生产队和所有社员的积极性。这种权力过分集中、管得过细过死的现象必须及时克服。目前各地创造的“社、队适当分权”，实行“统一经营、分级管理”制度，就是解决这种矛盾的主要办法。
    第四，是社员与社员之间的矛盾，这主要表现在中农与贫农的矛盾。譬如牲口、大车、林木、果树，入社作价偏低，价款不能按期归还等，这些问题引起上中农不满，但如果处理不当又会招致贫农不满。上中农是劳动人民，是基本群众，是我们的团结对象，贫、中农矛盾是人民内部矛盾之一，目前处理这种问题，应该在巩固贫农优势的基础上，对双方进行说服教育工作，并在经济上对上中农作必要的、适当的让步，做到不侵犯上中农的利益。譬如牲口、大车入社作价，如果按当时价格计算评得太低者应适当调整；社员拉脚的牲口大车，入社后可交由原主负责运输，在工分上给以适当照顾。所折价款应当按期归还，无力归还者应补付利息；长期不可能还款者可采取“保本定息”办法。果树林木入社因为作价很难准确，社又无法还款，以改为比例分红制最为适宜，这样，既减少许多麻烦，又可以避免乱砍林木的危险，广东有些地区的社对个别有特殊技术的果农，将果园交原主经营，由他自负盈亏，社只抽他年产值一定比例的公积金公益金，这种办法也可供各地参考。在这些具体问题上，京郊的情况有自己的特点，解决办法可能与别地不同，不必苟同。但应该注意研究这个问题，务求解决贫中农矛盾，达到贫中农团结的目的。
    社员与社员之间矛盾的另一表现是劳力强和劳力弱，技术高和技术低，从事农业劳动和非农业劳动（如手工业、小商贩等），超支户和存款户之间的矛盾。这主要要从全年工作安排中，对劳力弱非农业劳动的社员和超支户作适当安排，要用其所长，使之各得其所，都能增加收入。技术高者在工分上应适当照顾。对五保户及困难户则应从公益金中予以照顾。这里有一个原则，就是合作社的分配原则基本上是按劳取酬，但对无劳力、劳力弱及困难户应根据互助互济原则，予以适当照顾。
    第五，是队与队，主要是穷村与富村（也就是穷队与富队）之间的矛盾。所谓富村富队是指土地比较好，产量比较高，或者果树林木比较多，这是由于自然条件较好及农民多年劳动的结果，而不是剥削所得。有些社对富村没有适当照顾，全社拉平分配，结果使富村富队社员吃亏，引起他们不满，甚至引起村与村、队与队的对立，加剧了这种矛盾，这是不应该的。处理这种矛盾的办法可在包产中适当予以照顾，使他们不吃亏，或者吃亏不大，来缓和这种矛盾，以利团结。对穷村穷队则应从生产上予以帮助，使之逐渐提高产量，在一定期间赶上富村富队。
    第六，是干部与群众的矛盾。我们的基层干部绝大部分本质上是好的，他们与广大农民群众是有联系的，但是也有不少干部比较普遍地缺乏民主作风，遇事不与社员商量，不向老农请教，社员代表大会也没有按期召开。社干部只片面地所谓对上级负责听上级的话，不知道对群众负责听群众的意见，往往把两者对立起来，不走群众路线。有些社干部还有严重的强迫命令行为，自己不参加生产，补贴工分过多，账目不公开，甚至还有贪污舞弊情况。这样当然就造成了社员群众对干部不满，减产的合作社问题就更严重，这种不满情绪积累起来，就造成社员与干部对立，甚至闹退社吵架等现象。显然，这种矛盾如不很好解决，就会使已经建立起来的贫农优势为之涣散，造成合作社的不巩固，今年3月间中央发布的民主办社三个事项通知中所规定的办法，正是解决这个矛盾的及时良剂。近来干部下放，社干部参加生产，老农被尊重，账目公布，这就是最近时期农村出现新气象和干部与群众关系逐渐正常化的基本原因。
    此外还有农业合作社与供销社、信用社的矛盾，特别是农业社与手工业合作社的矛盾，去年中央指示虽然提出了城乡兼顾、统筹安排的方针，并规定农业社与手工业社分工的原则，但这些矛盾还未很好解决，需要今后加以研究，进一步做好工作来解决这些矛盾。
    二、关于民主办社
    从上面所谈六种矛盾，可以看出我国农村在阶级消灭之后，在旧的矛盾解决之后，又出现了新的矛盾。人民内部存在着矛盾，这是符合客观事实和社会发展规律的。这些矛盾如能够及时发现，加以合理解决，我们就能够团结住广大农民，就能够进一步发展生产力，就能够巩固合作社，就能充分发挥合作制的优越性。但是我们如果掩盖或者忽视这些矛盾，而空谈合作制的优越性，那么这些矛盾就仍然要存在而且发展下去，其结果就会使我们脱离群众，就会窒息群众的积极性，就会阻碍生产力的发展甚至倒退，就会影响合作社的巩固，最后就会使合作制的优越性不能发挥，甚至被抵消了，这也是客观事物发展的必然规律。因此我们的任务就是要及时发现这些矛盾，及时解决这些矛盾。要分析这些矛盾产生的根源，研究解决办法。要分析哪些矛盾是主要的，哪些是次要的，哪些最突出，哪些矛盾已经解决，哪些正在解决，哪些尚未找到解决的办法；然后再采取有效措施来逐步解决这些矛盾。当然，某一个矛盾解决了，又会出现新的矛盾，我们必须不断地改进工作，解决矛盾。只有这样，我们才能发展生产，巩固合作社，巩固与农民的团结，从而进一步发挥合作制的优越性。
    我们怎样解决这些人民内部矛盾呢？就是要贯彻执行毛主席和党中央所指示的方针，就是要发动群众，分清是非，是的对的坚持下去，非的不对的，则从团结出发，经过批评教育，加以纠正，达到新的团结。一句话，就是要认真贯彻民主办社的方针。
    所谓民主办社，这是什么意思呢？就是要以人民为主人，在农业合作社就是要以农民为主人，就是要贯彻群众路线的领导方法。合作社是领导农业生产的，搞好农业生产才能办好社、巩固社。那么，靠谁搞好农业生产呢？是不是可以只靠少数社干部，而不依靠广大社员呢？是不是可以只靠上级指导，而不依靠农民的积极性和创造性呢？在技术措施上是不是可以只靠技术员的指导，而不去总结和推广农民的实践经验呢？当然这样是不行的。要搞好农业生产需要两方面亲密合作，既要靠社员又要靠干部，既要有社员的积极性又要有上级的正确指导，既要靠农民的实践经验又要靠技术员的科学知识。但是，这两方面究竟哪一方面是主要的？显然，广大农民社员的积极性创造性和他们的实践经验是主要的。那么是不是干部、技术员和上级指示，就无足轻重了呢？不，不能这样对立地看问题，而是要把两者结合起来，这就是领导与群众相结合、集中与民主相结合、理论与实践相结合的群众路线的领导方法。大家知道，我们党领导中国革命之所以取得胜利、领导各方面工作之所以取得成绩，其中有一条根本路线，就是群众路线。中央早已指出，“领导者的任务在于出主意，用干部”。主意靠谁出呢？毛主席也早已明确指示：“将群众的意见（分散的无系统的意见）集中起来（经过研究，化为集中的系统的意见），又到群众中去作宣传解释，化为群众的意见，使群众坚持下去，见之于行动，并在群众行动中考验这些意见是否正确。然后再从群众中集中起来，再到群众中坚持下去。如此无限循环，一次比一次更正确、更生动、更丰富。”这就是毛主席对群众路线的领导方法的最明确最具体的指示。从此可见领导者的主意，并不是靠领导干部坐在家里凭自己的主观想像想出来的，而是要靠干部深入群众，与群众商量，听取群众的意见，把各方面各阶层群众的意见收集起来，加以分析、对比、去取、总结合成为比较全面的意见，以后通过代表大会成为群众的意见，再通过干部领导群众坚持下去。这样的主意就不是个人的主意，而是群众集体的主意，不是光靠个人的智慧而是靠广大群众集体的智慧。个人的力量个人的知识总是有限的，而群众的力量和知识则是无穷无尽的。一个领导者即使有什么了不起的才能也只是一个人，如果不与群众结合，那主意就一定出不好，事情也一定办不好，但是这个领导者如果能够与群众结合起来，依靠广大群众的集体力量和集体智慧，那主意就一定要比较符合于实际情况，事情就一定可以办得好一些，即使主意出了偏差，事情没有办好，群众也不会埋怨领导。领导与群众相结合、走群众路线，这就是党领导一切工作的根本路线。农业合作社是领导农民搞好农业生产的，更应该依靠农民，走群众路线，无论生产计划、技术措施、分组分队、包工包产、劳动定额、吸收投资、产品分配等，社干部都应该与社员商量，向老农请教，而后通过管委会、代表会作出决定，并依靠社员去执行。固然国家计划和上级指示是应该执行的，但在执行时也要根据当时当地的具体情况和可能条件，因地制宜、机动调整，而不能盲目执行。技术员懂得一般农业科学知识，这种知识是很宝贵的，但应该肯定技术员的实际知识没有农民多，技术员在课本上所学到的一般科学知识，不一定完全符合于每一个地方的具体情况，因此技术员的责任并不是规定死板的规程去指导农民执行，而是要虚心向当地有经验的老农老圃学习，和当地农民商量，研究各地的原有经验，加以总结提高，而后就地推广，外来的先进经验，一般都应该经过重点试验或多点试验而后推广。这就是说在技术措施上，也要贯彻从群众中来、到群众中去的群众路线，这就叫做理论与实践相结合。凡是这样做的技术员对农业生产就有帮助，就受到农民欢迎，技术员本身也容易提高，否则就会适得其反。总而言之，要解决合作社内部矛盾，办好合作社，搞好农业生产，就要实现民主办社、走群众路线。群众是一切力量的源泉，干部是党与群众联系的桥梁，群众是主人，干部是为人民服务的勤务员，干部要站在群众之中，不要站在群众之上，这几句话望所有同志深刻体会。
    那么，如何才能贯彻民主办社，走群众路线呢？我认为主要的环节是打通干部思想、放手发动群众。要在总结去年工作中，根据中央4月间的通知，向广大干部进行民主办社和群众路线的教育。另一方面，也应该在适当的时机，经过充分的准备，让群众展开实际的民主生活。满足他们迫切的民主要求，使他们畅所欲言，毫无顾虑地提出各种意见；然后引导他们懂得如何正确地行使他们的民主权利，培养他们的民主习惯。并通过民主的教育和实践，来培养社干部的群众观点，培养他们处处关心社员群众生活，遇事与群众商量、平等待人的民主精神和民主作风。特别要干部亲自下地参加生产，与群众一起劳动，同甘共苦，生活要群众化，不要特殊化。
    培养干部的民主精神和民主作风，满足群众迫切的民主要求，这是实现民主办社的先决条件。但光这样够不够呢？不够，还必须在这个基础上建立起合作社的民主制度，民主制度是多种多样的，但最主要的制度应该是下面几种：
    第一，是开好社员代表大会。社员大会是合作社的最高权力机关，应该按期召开。但我们的农业合作社自从去年实现高级化以后，一般规模都比较大，小的百把几十户，大的几百户千把户。就拿百把户的小社来说，平均每户两个社员，开起社员大会来就是一百多二百人，这样的社员群众大会，只能作为宣传教育和传布决议之用，而不能靠它来研究问题解决问题，因此必须建立社员代表大会制度，以代表大会作为社的最高权力机关。一切重大问题都要提交代表大会讨论通过，管理委员会只是执行代表大会的决议，不能超越社章所规定的权限，这是合作社最基本的民主制度。生产队是合作社的基本生产单位，如果队比较大，开队员会议人数过多，也应该建立代表会议制度。为了便于代表们能够充分发表意见，讨论问题，代表人数也不宜过多，一般社的代表人数以二三十人至三四十人为适宜，队的代表人数以十人左右、不超过二十人较为适宜。代表人数过多，就等于开群众会一样，难于发扬民主、充分发言。代表的成份应该具有广泛性，既要有贫农下中农代表，也要有上中农代表，既要有青壮年和妇女代表，也要有老年人代表，使他们能够代表各阶层各方面的意见。代表候选人的名单，如何提出，据各地经验，以先从各队社员中酝酿，由一定数量的社员联名提出为好，应力求避免支部提名的方式。支部提名应通过党员以社员资格在群众中活动，按规定人数和手续提出。代表会召开时间不能过长，因此讨论问题不宜太多，最好一次会议讨论一个问题。开会时要让代表们充分发表意见，正面的反面的、赞成的反对的都要讲，讲一次讲几次都可以，不要机械规定议事程序。
    第二，是定期召开老农座谈会、专业座谈会，聘请有经验的老农老圃当顾问，这应该作为代表大会的补充制度。老农一辈子种地，经验丰富，充分发挥和利用老农老圃的经验是搞好农业生产的重要条件，也是加强社内团结、减少内部矛盾的重要方法。
    第三，是实行“统一经营、分级管理”的制度，就是目前各地所实行的“权力下放、社队分权”的制度。这是目前各地的新创造，是解决目前合作社内部最突出矛盾（社与队矛盾、队与队矛盾、社与社员矛盾）的最好办法，也可以说是合作社的新体制。京郊有些社实行的“三包制”和“两个指标”“超产提奖”制，正是这种新体制的范例。所谓“三包”就是包工、包产、包成本（这个成本不包括工分，只包括种子、肥料、农具修理、农药、耕畜治疗等，也可以叫做“包开支”）。所谓“两个指标”就是计划指标高于常年实际产量，包产指标低于常年实际产量。京郊有些社的包产指标相当于“三定指标”，即比常年实际产量低15％—20％，这种包产指标是适当的。有些地方还规定包产指标三年不变。所谓“超产提奖”，就是队的实际产量超过包产指标时，以一定成数归队分红，作为奖励，京郊是二八分成（二成归社八成归队），河南、江苏是三七分成（有的地方是按照超产的比例奖劳动日，实际上也是以超产部分的七成左右奖给队）。这是很好的制度。由于实行“三包制”，生产队就要有一定权限，例如生产计划、技术措施、劳动定额、开支限额等虽然由社统一规定，但队要有一定机动权，以便于因地制宜，因时制宜，这也是很合理的。没有这种机动权，队就不好实行“三包”了。除管理权力适当下放外，在副业经营范围上，社队也应该适当划分。当然，增加队的权力，不要把各队变成独立的经济核算单位。有的合作社规模过大，在社和队当中设有大队，允许大队建立自己的财政系统，独立经营，自负盈亏，成为经济核算的单位，实际上变成分社，这就大社来说，这样做是必要和适当的。但是就多数中小社来说，让各个队都自负盈亏，就是不必要和不适当的。超产提成，最好是折成劳动日来奖励（示范章程有这个规定），在必要的时候也可以允许超产奖励分一部分粮食。但要注意不要使同一个社内队与队之间，相同的劳动日得到不同的报酬，以致引起队与队的不团结。总之，“权力下放，社队分权”是一种新创造，是合作社管理上的新体制，是民主办社中的一项关键性的制度。根据各地初步经验，实行这种制度有以下几种好处：
    （一）可以大大发挥全体社员的积极性和创造性，因为这种超产提成可以使队员得到分红，增加收入。过去各地也有超产提成办法，但因为超产指标和计划指标是一个指标，定得又很高，社员看到本队超产困难，看到无成可分，当然积极性就要差得多。虽然增产之后经过社统一分配，社员收入同样会增加，但有些社员这样想：全社几百个社员，即使增产了，分到自己名下也不过几百分之一，哪能分多少呢？这样一想，社员积极性就不会高起来，这是很自然的。现在包产指标低于常年实产量，超产部分又提奖七八成归队分配，社员看到有产可超，有成可提，队又只有几十户，算一算分到自己名下数量不少，这样他的积极性当然就要大大提高，这也是很自然的。最近各地凡是这样做的社就产生了新气象，社员生产劲头很大，就是明证。有些同志怀疑降低包产指标，超产分成，是不是会影响社的公共积累。实际上并无影响，因为农业合作社与工厂和国营农场不同，工厂、农场实行工资制，职工每月有一定工资。如果实行包产，又把包产指标定低了，工人除了固定工资以外又得到分成，从工人方面说是增加了额外收入，从国家方面说就要减少利润收入。所以工厂、农场的包产指标不能定得过低，这是很对的。但合作社则与工厂、农场不同，合作社是实行劳动日制，而不是实行工资制。过去生产队无产可超、无成可提，社员收入是全部取之于社的包产部分。现在社队分成，社员就从两个地方得到收入：一是取之于社的包产部分，一是取之于队的超产提成。如果要让队里多得超产奖励，从包产部分所得的报酬就要相对减少。包产部分的报酬并不是固定的，而且超产部分也不是全部归社员所得，因此社的公共积累仍然不会减少。相反，由于社员劳动积极性提高，产量增加了，社从超产中还可分得二三成，这样社的公共积累有时还可以相对增加。所以怕分成提奖会减少公共积累的疑虑是不必要的。
    （二）可以在生产管理上及时发现问题，解决问题。江苏有些社实行“产包到队，工包到组，田间零活包到户”的办法，河南则是“组分片，户分块，大活大家做，小活自己干”，这是一种明确的按级分工负责制，是使产量和劳动质量两个责任制统一起来的做法。这样分级管理，大家有责有权，将使一切不利于生产的问题都容易被发现，也容易得到解决。去年有些社把整片土地抛荒了还不知道，粮食收起来放在场里霉烂了也无人过问，这就是由于社的权力过分集中，下级无责无权所产生的恶果。
    （三）可以减少社干部的事务主义、主观主义和官僚主义。权力下放之后，社队职权明确划分，该由社管的事向社请示，由队管的事队敢于自行处理，不再向社干部找麻烦，这样社干部的事务就可以减少很多，问题处理也可以比较及时比较合理，群众路线的领导方法也就可以贯彻。社干部也就可以多抽出时间到队里去视察，并可以抽出时间参加生产，从而避免天天坐在办公室里脱离实际，脱离群众的毛病。同时这样也就可以减少社的脱产干部，减少工分补贴，从而增加社员收入，加强干部与群众的密切联系。
    （四）可以解决穷村富村、穷队富队之间的矛盾。对富村富队原来土地比较好，产量比较高，果树比较多的，可以在包产指标上适当加以照顾，使之不致吃亏太大。在这个基础上再加以说服教育，他们的抵触情绪，就容易消除下来。有些人说这是过分迁就上中农的作法，这种说法是不对的。我上面说过，富村富队收入比较大并不是剥削所得，怎么能说所有富村富队的社员都是上中农呢？又怎么能说这是过分迁就上中农呢？
    第四，建立财务公开制度也是民主办社中一个重要制度。在这方面江苏省最近有一个新创造：一方面从下而上地查帐，即队员选代表查队的帐，队派代表查社的帐；另一方面，是从上而下地查帐，即由各区乡会计辅导员分片召集所属各社的会计员将帐簿带来，互相审查。把这两种查账制度结合起来，再加上出纳员和会计员彼此分开管钱管账，就可以减少以至消灭会计混乱和贪污舞弊的现象。这些经验可供各地参考。
    三、关于耕畜的饲养管理问题
    在相当长的时期内，牲畜仍然是我国农业生产的主要动力，同时又是肥料和畜产品的来源，因此发展畜牧业，特别是发展耕畜是我们农业生产上一个极端重要的问题。农业和畜牧业是互相依存互相支援的不可分割的整体，必须并重、不可偏废。值得注意的是目前有些省份牲口瘦弱死亡很严重，不少地方出现人拉犁现象。北京郊区可能好一些，但据说牲口瘦弱也是相当普遍的。这种现象如不改变，也可能是造成死亡的前奏，因此也应十分注意这个问题，并找到解决办法。为什么牲口发生死亡瘦弱的现象？原因是多方面的，如草料不足，管理不善，使役过度，灾情影响，牛皮、牛肉价格太低，废牛不能宰杀等等。但据最近几个省份情况看来，牲口瘦弱死亡的主要原因还在于饲养管理过分集中。如河北、山东、河南三省多是集中管理、合槽喂养，牲口瘦弱死亡就较多，长江以南各省如湖南、湖北、广东、福建等省多是由社员分散喂养，牲口就没有死亡或很少死，而且增殖了不少。在河南省内洛阳和信阳等专区有二十八个县牲口多分散饲养，死亡就较少，其他专区集中饲养的死亡就较多。这说明什么呢？说明集中饲养还是分散饲养，是对牲口瘦弱死亡与否起重大作用的因素。为什么集中饲养会增加牲口的瘦弱死亡呢？道理很简单，牲口个子有高低，体力有强弱，脾气有好坏，吃草有快慢，分散饲养彼此无关，集中饲养则容易强欺弱，大欺小，吃快的吃饱了，吃慢的饿肚子，加上有些圈栏太小，许多牲口挤在一起，彼此打架，休息不足，瘟疫传染，便造成牲口瘦弱死伤；社员为了争工分，又拼命使用牲口，这样“食少事烦”，当然就要促成牲口的大批死亡。为改变这种情况，中央已于最近发了紧急指示，要各地立即注意，改变集中饲养，将牲口交给社员分散饲养，最好分给原主饲养，并归他使用，建立饲养使用合一制，如湖北省的五定制度（定草料、定膘、定活、定工分、定繁殖），这是挽救牲口瘦弱死亡的最有效办法。
    我们来研究一下，这种分散饲养有什么好处呢？我认为好处有六：
    （一）可以避免牲口打架，便于不同习性的牲口吃得饱，睡得足。
    （二）可以不用全劳力来当饲养员，而便于利用老人、小孩和半劳力看管牲口，并使他们得到一定收入。
    （三）可以利用群众原有圈栏，减少合作社重盖大圈栏，增加基本建设开支。
    （四）牲口分散到户后，饲养户可以分头设法收集一些草料，以减少合作社统筹草料的困难。
    （五）如采用饲养使用合一制，饲养户为了长期使用牲口多得工分，必然更加爱护牲口，而减少牲口的瘦弱死亡。
    （六）可以避免或者减少牲口瘟疫的传染，增加牲口的繁殖率。
    从以上六大好处，可以看出分散饲养是目前避免牲口瘦弱死亡的根本办法，特别是耕牛应该如此。骡马原则上也应该分散饲养，有些地方为了使用方便，可以按一套农具所需的马匹（如二三匹或五六匹）分到一户或两户负责饲养（河南叫做分犋喂养、养用合一制），而过分集中饲养，只从便于使用出发，而不从便于保护和繁殖牲口出发，这种想法和作法总是不对的。
    有些同志认为牲口已经集中饲养，现在又重新分散，是不是一种倒退现象，是不是违反社会主义的集体主义原则，这种说法是完全错误的。社会主义制度主要表现为生产资料的集体所有制，而不是个体所有制，至于生产的经营管理是高度集中还是适当分散，就要根据各种生产对象和当时当地的具体情况来决定，原则是要看如何有利于生产。现在各地牲口管理的经验，是集中不利而分散有利，那为什么一定要集中而不能分散呢？如果因集中饲养致使牲口大批死亡，我们还坚持集中不变，那么牲口大批死亡之后，用人拉犁来耕地，影响到农业生产，这种无条件集中的社会主义制度是哪里也不会有的，即使有也显示不了什么优越性。现在我们有一些同志确实有一种机械观点，只能集中不能分散，只能大不能小，只能高不能低，以为这样就是社会主义，其实这是一种不从实际情况出发，不按实际情况办事的最有害的教条主义、主观主义观点，这种有害的观点必须加以严厉批判，使之改变过来。
    四、关于肥料问题
    大家知道，发展农业生产的主要条件，第一是水，第二是肥，这两个条件又是互相联系着的，要有水，下肥才有用，如果没有水利设备，遇到旱灾或者水灾，再多肥料也不能希望增产。北方农民缺乏积肥习惯，与水利条件太差是有关系的，所以合作社要争取农业增产，应该用大力来逐步解决水利问题。但在水利问题解决的同时必须解决肥料问题。今年京郊减少了二千万斤豆饼，这对增产是有影响的，但国家没有这么多豆饼供应。由于我国工业落后，短时期内又不可能大量供应化肥。那么解决肥料的出路何在呢？我想出路只有一条，就是自力更生，就是要下决心，充分使用人畜粪尿，这是目前解决肥料来源最实际而又是最可靠的办法。就全国来说，我们有六亿人口，近一亿头猪，八千多万头大牲畜。此外还有几亿只鸡、鸭、鹅、兔、羊、狗等，这些粪肥如果能很好地收集起来，再加上绿肥、杂肥、化肥，该是多么大的肥源？就北京来说，全市有四百万人，至少有三百万人的粪尿可以收集起来，养猪三十万头，还有其他大小牲畜，而全郊区只有地二百万亩，作为二年三熟，播种面积也不过三百万亩，有这么多的人畜粪肥，这不是可以解决很大问题吗？我认为每个人的肚子就是一个小型化肥工厂，每一头牲口的肚子也是一个小型化肥工厂。这些小型化肥工厂天天在制造肥料。据科学家说人畜粪尿是有机肥，可以培养土壤，化学肥料是无机肥，它不能改良土壤，久了还可能破坏土壤。因此收集人畜粪尿便成为我们解决肥料的主要出路，这是求诸己而不求诸人的最简便最可靠的出路。现在的问题就在于我们重视不重视，下决心不下决心。有人说南方农民有积肥习惯，北方农民无此习惯，因此要做到这点是几乎不可能。这种看法是不对的。在个体经济时代要做到这点确是很难的，但在合作化以后，社会条件改变了，这个可能性也就随之提高。张郭庄社用定价收购人尿，结果很快就收集到几万斤，这个事实证明在合作化条件下要收集人畜粪尿，是完全可以做到的。望各位同志好好与各社干部研究一下，定出收购人畜粪尿的办法（要按质论价，按斤计算），并按月给予一部分现款。如能够每个社都这样做，肥料问题就很快可以解决。
    为了收集粪肥，便要大量发展养猪。目前毛猪收购价格已经提高，农民养猪有利可图，再加上提高猪粪收购价格则得利更大。为了解决养猪饲料问题，中央已通知各社自留地可以超过每人平均土地数的5％，某些地区可以达到10％。因此目前大量养猪的条件已比以前好得多了。现在主要的问题除了解决猪源、防治猪瘟之外，还必须改变毛猪统购办法。南方不少地方农村已由“包购包销”办法改为“只购不销”办法——城市服务部门只对城市工矿负供应肉食之责，而对农村则由农业社自养自宰，国家只收购其多余部分，采购任务商定后几年内增产不增购。这个办法很受农民欢迎，你们可以找某些社试行一下，有效后再全面推广。这对发展养猪在目前可以说是一个主要关键。
