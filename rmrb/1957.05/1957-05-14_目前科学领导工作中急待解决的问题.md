Problems Urgently Requiring Resolution in Current Scientific Leadership Work
        Shi Luji, Associate Research Fellow, Institute of Experimental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences

    Currently, one problem urgently requiring resolution in leadership work is the regularization of scientific research.
    Regarding the Party's leadership over science, my views and those of some scientific workers who have recently returned to China are largely the same. We believe that the Party must be the leader of science, and leading science is one of the Party's important tasks; because the Party is the guide leading us towards a communist society. In the one or two years since our return to China, many of the Party's measures in scientific policy, planning, and organizational work, such as the Hundred Schools of Thought, the Twelve-Year Plan, etc., have proven that the Party can assume the responsibility of a scientific leader and is a powerful leader. We believe that the Party can and will definitely lead science well.

    We believe that there should be a division of labor between scientific leaders and scientific workers. In our understanding, the work of leaders should be comprehensive, such as policies and planning for scientific research, coordination and weighting with other departments, organization of scientific workers, and creating conditions for the development of science, helping scientific workers establish correct Marxist-Leninist thought, etc.; it should not be leadership of many work details, such as research methods, techniques, and the expenditure of daily research funds. In natural science, we believe that leaders do not need to express their attitude on debates over certain theories and doctrines. If there are two or more schools of thought that can truly be called such for the explanation of the same phenomenon, this is enough to show that the current data or facts are insufficient and cannot determine right and wrong. Such disputes should be resolved by scientific workers themselves, and decisions should not be made using political methods. Otherwise, it will be detrimental to the progress of science. In this regard, the Party should strictly implement the policy of letting a hundred schools of thought contend.

    As far as the current situation is concerned, we believe that one problem urgently requiring resolution is the regularization of scientific research. The following problems currently exist:

    (1) Time cannot yet be reasonably guaranteed. There are various reasons for this. For example, there is too much planning work and too little time to implement the plans, there are still many part-time jobs, and the time for meetings and social activities cannot be strictly limited to within one-sixth.

    (2) The cooperation between Party members and professional personnel is not good enough, often causing great losses in manpower, materials, and time. For example, some scientific work is continuous. In some units, the comrades leading the study often transfer personnel to listen to reports without consulting professional personnel, causing some experiments that are in progress to be interrupted, resulting in the failure of some experiments, causing great losses. Regarding this specific matter, we believe that ideological education is important, and the reason why ideological education is important is because it can enable everyone to build socialism better, rather than disregarding everything and "ideological education for the sake of ideological education." The means to achieve a certain goal should not be used to hinder the achievement of that goal. Why can't some reports be distributed to various units in stages using more tape recordings, for example, broadcasts of the same report are available on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays, allowing staff to choose a suitable time to listen.

    Also, in universities and research institutions, during vacations, all instruments and laboratories are sealed for safety, power and water are cut off, and even access is prohibited. Although this guarantees safety, many research projects that cannot be interrupted have to be stopped and started from scratch. Some professors who are busy at ordinary times and can only do some research work during vacations have no choice but to give up. This approach is also a loss to the country. We believe that safety is important, and safety is to ensure that work can proceed smoothly. However, a passive attitude should not be adopted towards safety work, but rather an active attitude should be adopted, using strengthening security organizations, etc., to ensure safety, rather than simply sealing the doors.

    (3) A regular research administrative system has not yet been established, and the administrative powers of various levels have not been properly divided. Therefore, matters, no matter how big or small, are reflected upwards at all levels, waiting for leaders to solve them, which delays the time. As a result, some work is stopped midway waiting for resolution, resulting in low work efficiency and failure to complete plans on schedule. This approach also forces leaders to be buried in trivial matters day and night, without sufficient time to consider major issues, resulting in fluctuating upper-level plans, which in turn increases the specific work of lower-level cadres, cyclically causing leaders to be buried even deeper in trivial matters. The relationship between administrative personnel and professional personnel is also unclear. In some units, scientific workers, apart from knowing that the director or department head is busy attending meetings all day, do not know what the director or department head is doing. It often creates a situation where scientific workers do not understand the overall situation of the institute or department, have a feeling of being in this institute (or department) but not like a member of this institute (or department), and cannot work with peace of mind.

    Without a good, regular administrative system, it also creates an irresponsible attitude among cadres at all levels.

    (4) The "iron rice bowl" within research institutions still needs to be improved. Socialism should guarantee an "iron rice bowl" for everyone who is willing to work for the construction of socialism. Our Party is doing just that now. But what should be done with some people who are not suitable for holding this kind of "iron rice bowl" but are suitable for holding another kind of "iron rice bowl"? Also, the vast majority of young people are very hardworking and eager to make progress, but there are also a very small number of "socialist young masters and young ladies" who disdain to do this kind of thing, think that kind of work is meaningless, but they don't have many things they can really do. If the first persuasion is ineffective, the second persuasion leads to emotional problems, and the third persuasion leads to a request for a job transfer. Is ideological education alone enough to solve this kind of thing now? Is there still a need for a little "material basis for ideological education"? There is no arrangement for such problems now. Because these kinds of things are not resolved, they often cause confusion and unrest in some units.

    (5) Communication between the Party and senior researchers is not enough. We listened to Chairman Mao, Premier Zhou, and the Party Central Committee's reports on policies that penetrated our hearts, but most of us feel that within their units, there is still a sense of being unable to communicate upwards and downwards.

    (6) The research material supply system is not yet reasonable, which affects the progress of scientific work and the backlog of materials. For example, the supply of many materials, whether from abroad or domestically, often cannot arrive on time. Many small items cannot be bought anywhere; many domestically produced items are also ordered from abroad; many items that can be produced domestically are forced to be ordered from abroad because there are no factories that can undertake the manufacturing; many precision instruments from abroad are often damaged or have parts lost during domestic transportation, etc. Also, some production units have set too rigid regulations, such as setting the number of units ordering too large, so some research units are forced to purchase quantities far exceeding their needs, causing backlogs and freezing the unit's funds. In severe cases, some are forced to buy one to two tons in order to buy one or two kilograms of items.

    In addition to the above, there are some other problems that need not be listed further. In short, we hope that leaders can widely understand the situation and resolve these problems as soon as possible to facilitate the progress of scientific work.

    Regarding the relationship between leaders and those being led, there are still some gaps. We believe this is due to: (1) Scientific workers and Party members have not yet been able to get along with each other like ordinary friends. Currently, the phenomenon of Party members and scientific workers respecting each other from a distance is still quite common. We eagerly hope that everyone can work hard to break this gap, so that the ideological level of scientific workers can be truly improved, and the scientific level of Party members can also be improved. (2) Some Party members believe that the Party's leadership means that the actual work of scientific research must be led by Party members. We believe this is unnecessary. On the contrary, the Party directly leading actual scientific work through scientists (Party members or non-Party members) can more effectively complete the scientific research tasks assigned by the Party under today's limited manpower and material resources conditions.

    目前科学领导工作中急待解决的问题
        中国科学院实验生物研究所副研究员　施履吉
    目前领导工作急待解决的一个问题是科学研究的正规化
    关于党对科学的领导，我和一些刚回国不久的科学工作者的看法是大同小异的。我们认为党必须是科学的领导者，领导科学是党的重要任务之一；因为党是领导我们走向共产主义社会的指导者。在我们回国后的一二年中，党在科学政策、规划和组织工作上的许多措施，如百家争鸣、十二年规划等，都证明了党已能负起科学领导者的责任，而且是有力的领导者。我们相信党可以而且一定能把科学领导得很好。
    我们认为在科学领导者与科学工作者之间应该有个分工。领导者的工作照我们的理解应该是全面性的，如科学研究的政策、规划，和其他各部门间的配合和比重，科学工作者的组织，以及为发展科学创造条件，帮助科学工作者树立正确的马列主义思想等；而不应该是对许多工作上细节的领导，如研究的方法、技术、和日常研究经费的开支等。在自然科学中若干学说和理论的争论，我们认为领导者不必表明态度。对同一现象的解释，如果有两个或两个以上真能称为学派存在时，这正足以说明目前的资料或事实还不足，还不能确定是非。这种争论应该让科学工作者自己去求得解决，而不应用政治方法做出决定。否则，是有害于科学的进展的。在这方面，党应该严格执行百家争鸣的政策。
    就目前而论，我们认为急待解决的一个问题，就是科学研究的正规化。目前存在着以下的几个问题：
    （一）时间还不能合理的保证。这有种种原因。例如计划工作多而实行计划的时间少，兼职兼差的事情还很多，开会和社会活动等的时间还不能严格限制在六分之一以内等。
    （二）党和业务人员配合得不够好，往往造成人力、物力和时间上的极大损失。例如某些科学工作是有连续性的，在有些单位内，领导学习的同志常常不同业务人员商量，就把人员调去听报告，以致将某些正在进行的实验中途停顿，致使有些实验前功尽弃，造成极大的损失。就这件具体事情而论，我们认为思想教育是重要的，思想教育之所以重要是为了它能使大家把社会主义建设得更好，而不是不顾一切地“为了思想教育而思想教育”。不应拿了达到某一目的的手段来妨碍了达到这个目的。某些报告为什么不能多用些录音带分给各单位分期播送，例如在星期一、三、五、六这些时间里，都有同一报告的播送，可让工作人员选择适宜时间去听。
    还有，在高等学校和研究机关内，一到假期为了安全将所有的仪器和实验室加上封条，停电停水，甚至禁止出入。这样做安全是保证了，可是许多不能中断的研究工作只得停止，以后再从头做起。有些教授因平时忙而只能在假期内做些研究工作的，也只好不做了。这种做法对国家也是一种损失。我们认为，安全是重要的，安全是为了保证工作能顺利进行。但对安全工作不能采取消极态度，而应该采取积极态度，用加强保安组织等来保证安全，而不是封门大吉。
    （三）正规的研究行政制度还没有建立，各级行政职权没有好好划分。因此，事无大小层层向上反映，等待领导解决，而延误了时刻。结果使有些工作中途停止等待解决，以致工作效率低，计划不能按期完成。这种做法，也迫使领导者日夜埋于琐碎事情之中，没有充分时间来考虑重大问题，造成上层计划的摇摆不定，复又增加了下层干部的具体工作，周而复始地又令领导者更深一层地埋于琐碎事情之中。行政人员与业务人员的关系也不明确。在有些单位内，科学工作者除知所长或系主任终日忙于开会以外，不知所长或系主任所作何事。常造成科学工作者对全所或全系情况的不了解，有在这一所内（或系内）而又不像在这一所内（或系内）一分子的感觉，不能安心工作。
    没有好的正规的行政制度，也造成各级干部对事情的不负责的态度。
    （四）研究机构内的“铁饭碗”还需要改良。社会主义是应该保证每个愿意为建设社会主义而工作的人有个“铁饭碗”的。我们的党现在就是这样做。但有些不合于拿这一种“铁饭碗”而合于拿另一种“铁饭碗”的人，应该怎样办？还有，青年人极大部分都很努力上进的，但是也有极少数的“社会主义的大少爷和大小姐”，嫌这种事不屑做，那样工作无意义，然而他们真能做的事又不多。初次劝解无效，再次劝解闹情绪，第三次劝解他就请求调工作。现在的问题仅仅是思想教育就能解决这类的事情呢？是否还需要有一点“思想教育的物质基础”？关于这类问题，现在还没有一个安排。因为这类事情不得解决，常引起某些单位的混乱和不安。
    （五）党和高级研究人员之间互通声息还不够。我们听了毛主席、周总理以及党中央有关政策的报告透彻心腑，可是我们之中的大部分人认为在他们的单位中仍有上不能通，下不能达之感。
    （六）研究的物资供应制度尚没有合理，影响到科学工作的进展和物资的积压。如许多器材的供应，不管是国外或国内的，常不能按期到货。许多小件东西无处可买；许多国内出品的也向国外去定；许多国内能生产的，因为无厂可以承担制造被迫向国外定购；许多国外来的精密仪器在国内运输中常受损坏或遗失零件等等。还有有些生产单位定的规章太刻板，如定购的单位数量过大，因而有些研究单位被迫购买远远超过所需的数量，造成积压和本单位的资金冻结。在严重的情况下，有的为了购买一、二公斤的东西，被迫购买一吨到两吨。
    除以上所说的以外，还有一些问题也不必多举了。总之，我们希望领导者能广泛地了解情况，早日解决这些问题，以利科学工作的进行。
    在领导者与被领导者的关系上，还存在一些隔阂。我们相信这是由于：（1）科学工作者与党员还没有能互相像普通朋友一样的相处。目前党员和科学工作者，互相敬而远之的现象还相当普遍。我们急切地希望大家能努力打破这种隔阂，这样科学工作者的思想水平才能真正得到提高，党员的科学水平也才能得到改进。（2）有些党员认为党的领导就是在科学研究的实际工作中必须由党员来领导。我们认为这是不必要的。相反的，党通过科学家（党员或非党员）来直接领导实际科学工作，在今天有限的人力物力境况下，更能有效地完成党所交给的科学研究任务。
