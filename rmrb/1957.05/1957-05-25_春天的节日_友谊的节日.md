    Spring Festival, Festival of Friendship
    Lashidov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Uzbek Republic
    In these bright spring days, we are traveling in China with Comrade Voroshilov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. New life has awakened nature. At the foot of the mountains near Beijing, violets are blooming everywhere. The trees in Anshan and Shenyang are bursting with tender leaves. The entire city of Shanghai is covered in lush greenery. Beautiful maple trees stretch out their branches gracefully.
    The colorful azaleas are pleasing to the eye. Light pink peach blossoms cover the green countryside of Hangzhou. Majestic banana trees solemnly welcome the arrival of spring. Spring has arrived, and with every step, in every drop of warm and refreshing rain, in the joyful songs of birds, and in the smiles of children, one can breathe the fresh air of spring.
    People's China is blooming with the flowers of spring. Flowers are blooming in cities and villages, in high mountains and plains. From the Gobi Desert to the Yellow Sea, from the Himalayas to the Pacific Ocean, life is thriving.
    We are deeply convinced of this because we have visited factories and agricultural production cooperatives, and talked with workers, experts, farmers, and intellectuals.
    Under the wise leadership of the Communist Party, the working people of People's China are valiantly and selflessly changing their land, making it even more beautiful.
    In these spring days, I am reminded of the magnificent Yangtze River. For generations, people dreamed of connecting the two banks with a bridge. Many foreign engineers had tried to solve this complex problem, but the deep and watery Yangtze River did not acknowledge the efforts of these experts, and the people's dream remained unfulfilled. Only the great and selfless friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people provided a solution, effectively studying the capricious riverbed and formulating a bold plan for a magnificent structure.
    The visits to various enterprises in Shenyang left us with indelible impressions. Shenyang is the administrative center of Liaoning Province, China's largest metallurgical, machinery manufacturing, chemical, textile, and food industrial region.
    We walked through the huge, clean workshops of the First Machine Tool Factory with great pleasure and pride. During the Japanese occupation, this was just a small repair shop. In a short period, the Chinese working people transformed it into a first-class factory, equipped with highly productive, state-of-the-art mechanized production processes, producing more than twenty types of metal-cutting lathes.
    However, the most remarkable thing is the people in the factory who are creating this great enterprise, namely, the six thousand workers and experts. Working alongside Chinese comrades in the factory are dozens of Soviet engineers, who generously impart their experience and knowledge. People here speak with warmth and affection about the Soviet friends who have dedicated their energy to the development of industry in fraternal China.
    Not far from Shenyang, the Anshan Iron and Steel Company is the pride of the Chinese people. Many people work here, and open-hearth furnaces smelt the steel that the Chinese national economy craves day and night.
    New things have taken root in the Chinese countryside. In a short period, 96% of farmers have joined production cooperatives. The cooperatives are successfully developing new land, expanding crop production, and significantly increasing their income.
    We visited the "October" Cooperative in Zhejiang Province, not far from Hangzhou. We walked up a picturesque valley, with peach blossoms blooming all over the hillsides, and in a clean, well-equipped, and poetically named village of "Meijiawu," tea farmers warmly welcomed us. The tea gardens were buzzing with the intense work of picking tea. The nimble hands of the tea pickers flashed quickly, filling basket after basket.
    In the office of the cooperative's management, everyone drank tea brewed with freshly picked, fragrant green tea while engaging in heartfelt conversation. The members told us how they work together with one heart and one mind. People saw firsthand the superiority of the new over the old. In the past two years, they have reclaimed sixty-two mu of new land, forty mu for tea gardens and twenty-two mu for orchards.
    In 1950, each mu yielded forty kilograms of tea, and in 1956, it reached seventy-six kilograms. The members are determined to fulfill their socialist pledge this year, with an average yield of eighty-five kilograms of tea per mu. Compared to 1950, the cooperative's income has increased nearly fivefold.
    When you talk with these simple and modest workers, you become convinced that they will definitely achieve their goals, and that they wholeheartedly believe in the Communist Party's policy—the policy of transforming the nation's agriculture.
    The cordial speech of Comrade Peng Zhen, Chairman of the Beijing Municipal People's Committee, at the mass rally of 100,000 people welcoming the Soviet people's representatives, deeply moved us. He said, "The flowers of Sino-Soviet friendship are blooming on the vast land of our two countries. Long live the great unity of the socialist family headed by the Soviet Union!"
    In response to these words of welcome, Comrade Voroshilov said, "We are excited and moved by the warm, sincere, and enthusiastic welcome we have received from the Chinese people during our friendly visit to fraternal China. We regard this as a vivid expression of the Chinese people's love and respect for the Soviet people."
    The two great words "friendship" are noble and powerful. They arouse the beautiful emotions in people's hearts and strengthen their spiritual power. Life and work are pleasant when you feel that there is a reliable friend by your side who is always the same in labor, struggle, and joy. The friendship between the people of our two brotherly countries is eternal and is constantly expanding and deepening in common hard work and in the struggle for common great goals.
    All members of our socialist family, from young children to white-haired elders, cherish this friendship and move forward towards the common goal of happiness. There are often various misfortunes in life, and there are often storms. However, the strength of the sacred fraternal friendship between the Soviet and Chinese people surpasses the turbulent rivers and the giant waves in the ocean. Hundreds of millions of ordinary people around the world place their hopes on this friendship.
    Sino-Soviet friendship strengthens the forces of peace-loving people in all countries a hundredfold.
    Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council said at the reception welcoming the representatives of the Soviet Union and more than forty other countries who came to Beijing: Noble friendship makes the spring here warmer and makes this great festival more glorious….
    Let the flowers of Sino-Soviet friendship bloom even more luxuriantly!
    May this friendship, which inspires all the people of the Soviet Union and China, last for ten thousand years, and may this friendship last forever for the most beautiful things in the world, for the spring of all mankind!

### 春天的节日　友谊的节日

    春天的节日　友谊的节日
    乌兹别克共和国最高苏维埃主席团主席　拉希多夫
    在春光明媚的日子里，我们随同苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席伏罗希洛夫同志在中国旅行。新生活唤醒了大自然。在北京附近的山脚下，紫罗兰遍地盛开。鞍山和沈阳的树木嫩叶齐放。整个上海都覆盖在一片翠绿之中。美丽的枫树落落大方地伸展出枝叶。
    五色缤纷的杜鹃花悦人心目。淡粉色的桃花布满了杭州的绿色郊野。雄伟的芭蕉隆重地欢迎春天的到来。春来了，在每一步中，在每一滴温暖清心的雨点里，在群鸟愉快的歌声中，在孩子们的微笑里，都能呼吸到春天新鲜的气息。
    人民中国开遍了春之花朵。城市和乡村、高山和平原百花齐放。从戈壁到黄海，从喜马拉雅山到太平洋，生活欣欣向荣。
    对这一点我们深信不疑，因为我们访问了工厂和农业生产合作社，同工人、专家、农民和知识分子谈过话。
    人民中国的劳动者在共产党的英明领导下，英勇地、忘我地改变着自己的土地，使它更加美丽。
    在这春天的日子里，我记起了雄伟的长江。人们祖祖辈辈幻想用一座桥联结起两岸。许多外国工程师都曾着手解决这个复杂的问题，可是深而多水的长江却不承认这些专家的努力，而人民的幻想也终成泡影。只有中苏两国人民伟大无私的友谊提供了办法，从而有效地研究了逞性的河床，制订了一个宏伟建筑的大胆的方案。
    在沈阳各企业的访问给我们留下了不可磨灭的印象。沈阳是中国最大的冶金、机器制造、化学、纺织和食品工业区——辽宁省的行政中心。
    我们怀着十分愉快和自豪的心情走过了第一机床厂的巨大整洁的车间。日本占领的时候，这里只不过是一个不大的修理厂。在很短期间，中国劳动人民就把它变成了头等的工厂，它拥有生产效能很高的、最新的生产过程机械化的设备，出产二十多种金属切削车床。
    可是，最了不起的还是工厂里的创造伟大事业的人们，就是六千工人和专家。在工厂里，同中国同志并肩工作的有数十个苏联工程师，他们慷慨地传授自己的经验和知识。这里的人们怀着温暖、爱戴的心情谈论那些把自己的精力献给兄弟中国发展工业事业的苏联朋友们。
    离开沈阳不远的鞍山钢铁公司是中国人民的骄傲。很多人在这里劳动，平炉日日夜夜炼着中国国民经济所渴望的钢。
    新事物在中国农村里生了根。在很短期间，96％的农民都加入了生产合作社。合作社正在顺利地开发新土地，扩大农作物生产，大量增加自己的收入。
    我们访问了离杭州市不远的浙江省“十月”合作社。我们沿着美丽如画的山谷向上走，桃花开遍山坡，在一个清洁、设施完善、名称富有诗意的“梅家坞”村里，茶农热情地欢迎了我们。茶园里正进行着紧张的采茶工作。采茶人敏捷的双手迅速地闪动着，装满了一筐又一筐。
    在合作社管理处的屋子里，大家一面喝着用新摘下来的气味芬芳的绿茶泡的茶，一面倾心交谈。社员告诉我们，他们怎样同心协力地工作。人们亲眼看到了新对旧的优越性。最近两年来，他们开垦了六十二亩新土地，四十亩做茶园，二十二亩当果园。
    1950年每亩采茶四十公斤，1956年达到七十六公斤。社员们今年决心要完成自己提出的社会主义保证，每亩平均要采八十五公斤茶。同1950年比较，合作社的收入增加了将近五倍。
    当你同这些质朴谦逊的劳动者谈话的时候，你会确信他们一定会达到自己的目的，他们全心全意地相信共产党的政策——改造全国农业的政策。
    北京市人民委员会主席彭真同志在欢迎苏联人民代表的十万人的群众大会上的亲切讲话，深深地感动了我们，他说：“中苏友谊的花朵，开遍在我们两国广阔的土地上。以苏联为首的社会主义大家庭的伟大团结万岁！”
    伏罗希洛夫同志在答谢这些欢迎的话时说道：“我们在兄弟中国的友好访问受到中国人民的亲切真挚的热烈欢迎，使我们兴奋和感动。我们认为这是中国人民对苏联人民的爱戴和尊敬的鲜明的表现。”
      “友谊”这两个伟大的字崇高而有力。它唤起人们心灵深处的美好情感，增强人们的精神力量。当你感到身旁有一个在劳动、斗争和欢乐中永远如一的可靠朋友的时候，生活和工作是愉快的。我们两个兄弟国家人民的友谊是永恒的，并且在共同的顽强劳动中，在为共同的伟大目标的奋斗中不断地扩大和加深。
    我们社会主义大家庭所有的成员，从年幼儿童到白发老人都十分珍重地带着这个友谊向共同的幸福目标前进。生活中时常有各种不幸，时常有暴风骤雨。但是，苏中人民神圣的兄弟友谊的力量却胜过波涛滚滚的河流，胜过大洋中的巨浪。全世界数亿的普通人都把自己的期望寄托在这个友谊上。
    中苏友谊使各国爱好和平的人民的力量增强百倍。
    国务院总理周恩来同志在欢迎苏联和其他来到北京的四十多个国家的代表时说道：崇高的友谊使我们这里的春天更加温暖，使这个伟大的节日更加光辉……。
    让苏中人民友谊的花朵开得更加茂盛吧！
    祝这个鼓舞着苏中全体人民的友谊千秋万载，愿这个友谊为了全世界最美好的东西，为了全人类的春天而永世长存！
