Street Talk

A Strange Ear

	The bureau chief went to the factory today
	To inspect the conservation situation.
	The workers made suggestions,
	Asking him to tell the factory director.
	The bureau chief felt it strange:
	“The factory director is right here,
	Asking me to relay the suggestion,
	What's the reasoning behind this?”
	The worker smiled and shook his head:
		“The factory director has strange ears,
	A phone call from above,
	And he's flustered and in a panic;
	The workers' thousands of words,
	Are like a gentle breeze passing by.”
						(Guangzhou Xiafu)

Treating Production as "Punishment"

	We have some junior and senior high school graduates here who are unwilling to participate in labor production, saying, "I haven't made any mistakes, why are you calling me back to my hometown?" It turns out that they saw some agencies in the special districts and counties expelling those cadres, teachers, workers, and agricultural cooperative directors who had made mistakes from their original units, and calling them home to participate in agricultural production, which was considered a serious punishment. Doing this makes it no wonder that young people say strange things.

Comparing Fathers

	In a primary school for children of cadres, every Saturday afternoon, many cars come to pick up the children of the leaders to go home. Among these children, the following argument arose: "Your jeep is not as good as my sedan!" "Your Chevrolet is not as good as my Victory brand!" "Your Victory is not as good as my ZIM!"
	This "comparison" is not limited to cars, but further extends to comparing their "fathers": "Your father is a regimental-level cadre, my father is a division-level!" "What does a division-level cadre count for, my father is an army-level!"
	If "division-level" is already nothing in the eyes of these children, then what do ordinary people count for?
	This is an old problem, but I think it should still be brought up.

At the Bus Station

	Whenever I wait in the long line at the bus station on weekends to go home, I always see cars carrying children speeding past. Sometimes the children stick their heads out of the window, looking at the long line of people waiting for the bus and laughing, revealing a contemptuous and proud expression. It's as if they're saying, "Look how comfortable I am, you still have to squeeze onto the bus!"
	I am not jealous of the children riding in cars, but I am worried that after getting used to riding in cars, they may forget the words "love labor, endure hardship" that the teachers teach in school.
	(Ye Hong, No. 27 Wanshou Road, Beijing)

Hard to See the President

	Some of our classmates have never seen the president. Some people say: "It's harder for us to see the president than it is for Beijingers to see Chairman Mao. Beijingers can see Chairman Mao at least twice a year in Tiananmen Square, but we have been at school for a year or two and still don't know what the president looks like." The president is often out attending meetings, and when he comes back, he is still attending meetings, or he hides in the office building.
	The Party Secretary, on the other hand, has given reports to the students, and everyone knows what he looks like. However, one thing caused everyone to discuss it for a long time. Not long ago, the Party Secretary criticized the students' dormitories for being unclean in his report. The Secretary specifically stated that he had seen it with his own eyes. That's right, in 1954, he went to the student dormitory once. He was telling the truth, but he didn't think about how much time had passed in the three years since then, and that most of the students had only enrolled after 1954!

    街谈巷议
    奇怪的耳朵
    局长今天下厂，
    检查节约情况。
    工人提了建议，
    请他转告厂长。
    局长觉得稀奇：
    “厂长就在这里，
    建议要我来转，
    这是什么道理？”
    工人微笑摇头：
      “厂长有怪耳朵，
    上级一个电话，
    忙得手慌脚乱；
    工人千言万语，
    都像微风吹过。”
                      （广州侠夫）
    把生产当做“处分”
    我们这里有一些初中和高小毕业生，不愿意参加劳动生产，说：“没犯错误，干吗叫我回乡？”原来他们看见有些专区和县里的机关，把那些犯了错误的干部、教师、工人、农业社长都从原来的单位开除，叫他们回家参加农业生产，这就算严重的处分了。这样做，就难怪少年们说怪话了。
        （江苏泗阳张启球、苏野）
    比爸爸
    在一个干部子弟小学里，每到星期六下午，就有很多小汽车来接首长们的孩子回家。在这些孩子里发生了这样的争论：“你的吉普车不如我的小卧车好！”“你的雪佛兰不如我的胜利牌！”“你的胜利还不如我的吉姆哩！”
    这种“比”并不只限于汽车，而进一步比起自己的“爸爸”来了：“你爸爸是团级干部，我爸爸是师级！”“师级干部算得什么，我爸爸是军级！”
      “师级”在这些孩子的眼里已经算不得什么了，那么普通的老百姓又算得了什么呢？
    这是个老问题了，可是，我觉得还应该提出来。
            （北京钢铁学院一学生）
    汽车站上
    每当周末我在汽车站长长的行列里等车回家的时候，总看到一辆辆载着孩子的小汽车风驰电掣地驶过。有时孩子从窗口探出头来，看着这长长的等车的行列发笑，流露出一种鄙视而又骄傲的神情。好像在说，“你看我多舒服，你们还要挤汽车呢！”
    我并不是嫉妒孩子们坐小汽车，而是耽心坐惯了汽车后，也许就会把学校里老师讲的“要热爱劳动，吃苦耐劳”，这一类的话忘光了。
    （北京万寿路二十七号叶鸿）
    院长难见
    我们有些同学从来没见过院长。有人说：“我们见院长比北京人见毛主席还难，北京人一年至少能在天安门看到两次毛主席，我们到学校一两年了，还不知道院长什么样。”院长常常出去开会，回来也是开会，要不就躲在办公楼上。
    党委书记呢，给同学作过报告，大家知道他的模样。可是有一件事，却让大家议论了半天，不久以前，党委书记在报告中批评同学的宿舍不清洁，书记特别表明他是亲眼见过的。这不错，在1954年，他到学生宿舍去过一次。他说的是实话，可是他没想想，时间已经过了三年，这中间会有多大变化啊，而且大半学生都是1954年以后才入学的哩！
          （安徽师范学院牟止鸣）
