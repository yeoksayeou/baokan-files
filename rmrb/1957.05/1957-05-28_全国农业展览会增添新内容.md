The added content explains that although China's agricultural production achievements have been great in recent years, it still lags behind many countries and needs to continue to make great efforts.
Xinhua News Agency - The content of the National Agricultural Exhibition has been further enriched. According to the staff of the exhibition, since the opening of the exhibition on February 20, the content of the exhibits has been continuously added and replaced; there have been particularly many additions in the past few days. The newly added content explains that although China's agricultural production has made great progress in recent years, some of it has not yet reached the level before the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the unit area yield of major grains is not high internationally, so it is necessary to continue to make great efforts.
	On either side of a large national map in the Crop One Pavilion, it can be seen that the number of counties (cities) that reached the grain production increase targets of the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) for 1967 in 1956 has increased from thirteen at the opening of the exhibition to nineteen.
	Several newly added charts in the Crop One Pavilion introduce the production of rice, wheat, soybeans, and miscellaneous grains in various countries around the world. The chart showing the rice production of the world's major rice-producing countries explains that China's annual rice production ranks first in the world, but its average yield per mu ranks only fifth in the world—only more than 470 jin, while the average yield per mu in Spain, Italy, Egypt, Japan, and other countries is more than 640 jin, with Spain's average yield reaching 788 jin. The chart showing the wheat production level of the world's major wheat-producing countries explains that the unit area yield of wheat in sixteen countries in the world is higher than that of China, and the unit area yield in Denmark, which has the highest unit area yield, averages 529 jin per mu, which is more than four times that of China. China's soybeans are world-renowned, but a chart shows that China's unit area yield of soybeans is still very low, and the United States, Canada, Japan, and Indonesia are all higher than China; in 1956, China's average yield of soybeans was 114 jin per mu, while the United States was 205 jin. Another chart shows that the country with the highest unit area yield of corn in the world is Canada—an average of 448 jin per mu in 1954, while China only had 176 jin.
	In the Crop Two Pavilion, the glass cotton cabinets representing China's annual cotton production have increased from the original five to nine. The original five cotton cabinets represented the total cotton production in five years: 1936 (the year with the highest cotton production before liberation), 1949, 1952, 1955, and 1956; now, the total production in four years, 1950, 1951, 1953, and 1954, has been added. The original five cotton cabinets, except for the one in 1936, were all taller than the previous one, indicating that China's total cotton production seemed to be increasing year by year after liberation; but the actual situation was not like this. The current cotton cabinets show that the one in 1953 was lower than the one in 1952, and the one in 1954 was lower than the one in 1953, and only in 1955 did it rise again and exceed the one in 1952; this shows that, because China cannot completely conquer natural disasters and there are still shortcomings in its work, cotton production is not smooth sailing and increasing year by year. The chart on China's tea production has also been replaced. The original chart only stated that production had increased significantly after liberation, but did not state to what extent the increase was; the current chart shows that although China's tea production has increased year by year after liberation, it had not recovered to the 1936 level until 1956. In addition, a newly added chart tells people that in 1955, China's average cotton yield was only 35 jin per mu, while the Soviet Union had 83 jin, Egypt had 67 jin, and the United States had 62 jin.
	The staff of the exhibition said that these charts tell us that since liberation, although China's agricultural production has made great progress and many units with high yields per unit area have emerged in various places, we are still far behind many countries in terms of agricultural production technology, equipment, and farming systems from a national perspective.

### 全国农业展览会增添新内容

    全国农业展览会增添新内容
    增加的内容说明：几年来我国农业生产成绩虽大，但还落后于许多国家，需要继续作很大努力。
    新华社讯　全国农业展览会展览的内容又有了新的充实。据展览会的工作人员说，展览会从2月20日开幕以来，展品内容就不断增添、更换；最近几天增添得特别多。新增加的内容说明，几年来我国农业生产虽然有很大的发展，但有的还没有达到抗日战争以前的水平，主要粮食的单位面积产量在国际上也不高，还须继续作很大的努力。
    在农作物一馆的一幅全国大地图两旁，可以看到：1956年达到全国农业发展纲要（草案）1967年粮食增产指标的县（市），已经由展览会开幕时的十三个变成十九个了。
    农作物一馆新增的几幅图表，介绍了世界各国水稻、小麦、大豆和杂粮等粮食作物的生产情况。世界主要产稻国水稻生产情况的图表说明，中国的水稻年产量占世界第一，但是每亩平均产量却占世界第五位——只有四百七十多斤，而西班牙、意大利、埃及、日本等国每亩平均产量都在六百四十斤以上，其中西班牙的平均产量达七百八十八斤。世界主要产麦国小麦生产水平的图表说明，世界上有十六个国家的小麦单位面积产量比中国高，单位面积产量最高的丹麦平均每亩产小麦五百二十九斤，相当于中国的四倍多。中国的大豆是名闻世界的，但是一幅图表说明，中国大豆的单位面积产量还很低，美国、加拿大、日本、印度尼西亚都比中国高；1956年中国大豆每亩平均产量是一百一十四斤，美国是二百零五斤。另一幅图表说明，世界上玉蜀黍单位面积产量最多的国家是加拿大——1954年每亩平均四百四十八斤，而中国只有一百七十六斤。
    在农作物二馆，表示我国棉花年产量的玻璃棉橱，已经由原来的五个变成了九个。原来的五个棉橱，表示着1936年（解放前棉花产量最高年份）、1949年、1952年、1955年和1956年等五个年头的棉花总产量；现在增加了1950、1951、1953年和1954年等四个年头的总产量。原来的五个棉橱，除1936年那个以外，一个比一个高，说明解放后我国的棉花总产量似乎是逐年上升的；但实际情况不是这样。现在的棉橱是1953年的比1952年低，1954年的比1953年低，1955年才又高起来超过了1952年；这说明，由于我国还不能完全征服自然灾害，工作中还有缺点，棉花生产并不是一帆风顺、逐年增产的。关于我国茶叶产量的图表也更换了，原来的图表只说明解放后产量有了显著提高，但没说明提高到什么程度；现在的图表使人们看到，解放后我国的茶叶产量虽然逐年增加，但是一直到1956年还没有恢复到1936年的水平。另外新增的一幅图表告诉人们：1955年中国的棉花产量每亩平均只有三十五斤，而苏联却有八十三斤，埃及有六十七斤，美国有六十二斤。
    展览会的工作人员说，这些图表告诉我们：解放以来，虽然我国的农业生产有了很大发展，各地也出现了许多单位面积高额丰产；但是从全国范围来讲，我们在农业生产技术、设备和耕作制度等方面还远远落后于许多国家。
