    John Bull Unwilling to Yield

    British Ambassador to the United States, Caccia, emphasized at the 350th anniversary celebration of Jamestown in the United States that "don't disregard Britain," and exclaimed that Britain is "determined never to admit defeat, never, never, never!" Not long ago, former British Prime Minister and 82-year-old Conservative Party veteran Winston Churchill also broke his recent silence, advocating that Britain should "continue to shoulder the world's leadership responsibilities." Churchill cried out that Britain "must catch up where it lags behind and continue to lead where it is already ahead."

    What is it that is driving this ousted British Prime Minister, who has also emerged from his secluded manor, to shout so loudly? In a word, it is the need to boost the morale of the hapless British ruling group, which has been disheartened by a series of setbacks. An article in the "Daily Telegraph," an important mouthpiece of the Conservative Party, can illustrate this point. In an editorial entitled "Striving to Regain Leadership," the newspaper said in a spirit of enduring hardship for future revenge that Churchill's words "are not just a nostalgic reminiscence of the motherland, he calls for perseverance, to resolutely recover from the blows received from both friend and foe in recent times." It continued: "These blows are serious, especially in the Middle East, and following these blows, there has been a period of playing a secondary role." After bitter reflection, British gentlemen are particularly resentful of their American "ally."

    This is indeed not surprising. Since the "Suez Crisis" occurred, followed by the failure of the invasion of Egypt, the American "ally" took the opportunity to seize the dominant position in the colonialist camp in the Middle East and put forward the "Eisenhower Doctrine," penetrating deeper and deeper into the original British colonial strongholds. American newspapers have also published comments ridiculing Britain: "John Bull must tightly hold onto Uncle Sam's coattails," "Now, Britain must rely on the United States to maintain its world position." All this is, of course, extremely unsatisfactory for the British lords who once dominated the world. Recently, news of the establishment of an "American-West German axis" has made them even more uneasy. Caccia's explicit warning as ambassador was clearly directed at Washington.

    Although today's John Bull has lost the prestige of the past, he is still not so easily willing to admit defeat to Uncle Sam. Recently, British military spending has been decided to be reduced, and overseas troops will also be withdrawn. This is to strengthen economic strength and concentrate efforts to enable Britain to also have "a considerable nuclear deterrent force." Regarding Europe, Britain has also put forward a so-called "grand plan" to counter the American-West German axis plan. British Foreign Office officials have said: "Realizing this plan is now one of the fundamental goals of British foreign policy." It is worth noting that the London "Times," which often reflects the British government's views, advocated in its editorial on April 30 that Britain should pay close attention to South America and include it in its expansion map. It seems that John Bull even wants to stick its horns into Uncle Sam's backyard.

    约翰牛不甘屈服
    英国驻美大使卡西亚日前在美国杰姆斯城三百五十周年纪念会上发表演说时强调“不要不把英国放在眼里”，并嚷道：英国“决心决不承认失败，决不，决不，决不！”不久前，前英国首相、八十二岁的保守党元老丘吉尔也打破近年来的沉默，鼓吹英国要“继续担负起世界的领导责任”。丘吉尔呼号说：英国“必须在落后的地方迎头赶上，必须在领先的地方继续跑在前面”。
    是什么东西推动着这位下台了的英国首相、也从退居的庄园中跑出来，这样大声竭呼的呢？一句话，这就是需要给那个被一连串挫折镇得灰溜溜的倒霉的英国统治集团打气。保守党的重要喉舌“每日电讯报”的一篇文章可以说明这一点。这家报纸在一篇题为“争取恢复领导地位”的社论中，以一种卧薪尝胆的精神说：丘吉尔的话“不光是一种令人怀念祖国的事情，他号召要坚持下去，坚决从最近时期所受到的敌友双方的打击中恢复过来”。它继续说：“这些打击是严重的，特别是在中东，并且继这些打击之后，又出现了一段充当次要角色的时期”。痛定思痛，英国绅士特别对他的美国“盟友”满腹怨气。
    这也的确难怪。自从“苏伊士问题”发生，接着又是侵埃战争失败，美国“盟友”趁机夺取了中东地区殖民主义阵营的支配地位，并且抬出“艾森豪威尔主义”，节节深入原先英国的殖民阵地。美国报刊还纷纷发表议论，奚落英国：“约翰牛必须紧紧地扯住山姆大叔的衣服下摆”，“现在，英国必须依靠美国才能维持自己的世界地位”。这一切对于曾经横行一世的英国爵士们说来，当然是极不称心的。近来，又传出关于建立“美国—西德轴心”的消息，更使得他们坐卧不安。卡西亚以大使身份所作的那样露骨的警告，显然是对华盛顿而发的。
    今日的约翰牛固然已经失尽了当年的威风，毕竟还不那么轻易就在山姆大叔面前甘拜下风。最近，英国军费已决定削减，海外驻军也要收缩。这是为了加强经济实力，并集中力量使英国也能“有一份可观的核威慑力量”。关于欧洲，英国还提出了一个所谓“宏大的计划”，以同美国—西德轴心计划相抗衡。英国外交部人士曾说：“实现这个计划，现在已经是英国外交政策的根本目标之一”。值得注意的是，经常反映英国政府意见的伦敦“泰晤士报”，在4月30日的社论中，鼓吹英国应该密切注意南美洲，把它列入扩张的版图。看来约翰牛甚至还想把它的头角，伸进山姆大叔的后院哩。
