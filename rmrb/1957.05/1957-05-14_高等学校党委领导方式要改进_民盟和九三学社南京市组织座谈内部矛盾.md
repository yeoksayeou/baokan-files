Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 13th: The Nanjing Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League and the Nanjing Branch Committee of the Jiu San Society convened a symposium on the morning of the 12th with more than 20 League and Society members holding administrative leadership positions in Nanjing's universities and scientific research institutions to discuss the issue of internal contradictions among the people existing in various universities and scientific research institutions.

    Regarding the issue of Party leadership, Chen Heqin, president of Nanjing Normal College, believed that, based on the experience of the Chinese revolution, the Party's leadership is definite, but the question is how to lead and to solicit the opinions of non-Party figures more. He mentioned that after liberation, he believed that the Party led everything, so everything had to be subordinate to the Party; he was the chairman, but he did not have to use his brain, and the Party member vice chairman was fully responsible for everything. In 1954, the president responsibility system was proposed, but he could not fully grasp the school's policies; the Party committee always discussed it first and then submitted it to the school affairs meeting for discussion and implementation. Laymen discussing the affairs of experts, asking people to implement it, I can only repeat it. He believes that there are three types of leadership: the first is fighting alone, the second is neither commanding nor obeying; and the third is strategic planning, winning decisive battles from a thousand miles away. He said: the first type is a leadership style that is divorced from the masses, and things will naturally not go well; the second type is laymen forcing their way into the affairs of experts, and the result is often complaining about everything; the third type of leadership is the best. The school Party committee grasps the general principles and policies, but when discussing school affairs, non-Party professors can be invited to participate and their opinions should be respected. In this way, experts and laymen will work together, which not only embodies the Party's leadership, but also gives play to the initiative of professors running the school. He believes that this kind of strategic leadership is more practical and can give play to all aspects.

    Qian Zhonghan, Vice President of Nanjing Institute of Technology, said: The problem is that the Party Secretary cannot solve the problems. In the past, the Party Committee forced some things on people and did not want people to use their brains. The president is often away attending meetings, and today the school's leadership is essentially "clerical politics." Saying that the president is acting arbitrarily, there is no "intention" at all, mainly a state of paralysis. Qian Zhonghan believes that the so-called Party committee governing the school is not mentioned in the Soviet Union or elsewhere. Our country does not have such regulations either. When the Party committees of some universities are discussing issues, they do not solicit or respect the opinions of non-Party members, and in fact the Party committee decides everything. He believes that it is wrong for the Party committee to decide everything in the school. Implementing national policies in universities also embodies the Party's leadership.

    Chen Minzhi, Chairman of the Nanjing Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, believes that sectarianism and dogmatism are very serious in universities. Sectarianism is manifested in the mystification of the personnel system, and policies are not made known to non-Party members. He believes that some Communist Party members do not see the progress of non-Party members. The Party Committee is the core, but it must: (1) make the Party's policies known to everyone; (2) give democratic parties positions and power, and the leadership style must be changed; (3) rely on veteran teachers to enable them to exert more light and heat; (4) everyone must struggle to strive to make the Party better play its role.

    Li Fangxun, Vice President of Nanjing University, believes that the school Party Committee is different from the factory Party Committee, and the Party's leadership style in universities should be improved, that is, the school Party Committee should listen more to the opinions of non-Party experts. In the past, this aspect was not done enough. When selecting students to study abroad, it seems that as long as they are politically pure, their academic success is guaranteed, and the opinions of teachers and department heads are not solicited, which often leads to losses. This approach is actually "strategic planning, rejecting people's opinions from a thousand miles away." Li Fangxun believes that the root cause of the above situation is that old intellectuals are considered worthless, and some Party members do not have a sufficient understanding of the difficulty of science. The Party's foundation in science and culture is too poor, and the main way to remedy the shortcomings in science is to rely on the masses. Fan Cunzhong, a professor at Nanjing University, said: The evaluation of intellectuals in the school is simplistic; when they are said to be useful, they are praised very highly, and when they are said to be useless, everything is negated. Gao Juefu, Vice President of Nanjing Normal College, believes that the personnel department controls the lifeline of scientific workers, but how much does the personnel department know about the academic community? Now, the number of people in the school can also be said to be too many or too few, because those who are wanted are not retained, and those who are retained are not needed.

### 高等学校党委领导方式要改进  民盟和九三学社南京市组织座谈内部矛盾

    高等学校党委领导方式要改进
    民盟和九三学社南京市组织座谈内部矛盾
    新华社南京13日电　中国民主同盟南京市委员会、九三学社南京分社委员会，12日上午召集在南京市各高等学校和科学研究机关担任行政领导工作的盟员、社员二十多人，座谈各高等学校、科学研究机关中存在的人民内部矛盾问题。
    关于党的领导问题，南京师范学院院长陈鹤琴认为，根据中国革命的经验，党的领导是肯定的，问题是如何来领导，要多征求党外人士的意见。他谈到自己在解放以后认为党领导一切，所以一切只有服从党；自己是主任委员，但不要动脑筋，一切由党员副主任负全责。1954年提院长负责制，但学校中的政策，我无法全面掌握；总是党委讨论后，再提交校务会讨论执行。外行讨论内行的事，要人家执行，我只能照唱。我认为领导有三种：第一种是单枪匹马，第二种是，既不能令，又不受命；第三种是运筹帷幄，决胜于千里之外。他说：第一种是离开了群众的领导方式，事情自然搞不好；第二种是外行硬干内行事，结果往往怨天尤人；第三种领导方式最好。学校党委掌握方针政策，但讨论学校事务时，可邀请非党教授参加，尊重他们的意见，这样，内行和外行打成一片，既体现了党的领导，也发挥了教授治校的积极性。他认为这种运筹帷幄式的领导，比较最切合实际，能够发挥各方面的力量。
    南京工学院副院长钱钟韩说：问题是党委书记不能解决问题。过去党委有些事是硬灌，不要人家动脑筋。院长经常在外开会，今日学校领导实质是“科员政治”，说院长一意孤行，根本没有什么“意”，主要是瘫痪状态。钱钟韩认为，所谓党委治校，不论在苏联或在其他地方，都没有这样说法。我们国家也没有这样的规定。有些高等学校的党委在讨论问题的时候，不征求与不尊重非党人士的意见，实际是党委决定一切。他认为党委决定学校一切，是不对的。在高等学校执行了国家政策，也就是体现了党的领导。
    民盟南京市委会主委陈敏之认为，高等学校宗派主义、教条主义很严重。宗派主义表现为人事制度神秘化，政策不使党外人士了解。他认为党外人士的进步，有些共产党员看不到。党委是核心，但必须：（1）要让党的政策和大家见面；（2）民主党派要有职、有权，领导作风必须改变；（3）必须依靠老教师，使他们发挥更多的光和热；（4）大家要斗争，争取使党更好地发挥自己的作用。
    南京大学副校长李方训认为，学校党委和工厂党委不同，目前高等学校的党的领导方式应改进，那就是学校党委多听听非党专家的话。过去，这方面是做得不够的。选派留学生，好像只要政治纯洁，就保证他学术上成功，也不征求教师和系主任的意见，结果往往带来损失。这样做法，实际上是“运筹帷幄，拒人意见于千里之外”。李方训认为产生上述情形的根源，是认为旧知识分子一无可取，有的党员同志对科学的艰巨性认识不足。党在科学文化的基础上太差了，如何补救在科学上的缺陷，主要是要依靠群众。南大教授范存忠说：学校里对知识分子的估价是简单化；说他有用时便提的很高，说他无用时即否定一切。南京师范学院副院长高觉敷认为，人事部门掌握了科学工作者的命脉，但人事部门究竟知道多少学术界的情况。现在，学校里人数也可以说是也多也少，因为要的不留，留的不需要。
