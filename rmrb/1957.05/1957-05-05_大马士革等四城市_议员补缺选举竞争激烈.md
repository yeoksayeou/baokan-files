Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, May 4th: By-elections for deputies were held today in the Syrian cities of Damascus, Homs, Suweida, and Mount Druze. These by-elections are to fill the seats of the four deputies who were sentenced in February for plotting to overthrow the government.

Due to the recent events in Jordan, these by-elections have attracted widespread attention. Officials in Washington have made it clear that they hope the events in Jordan will be repeated in Syria. Joseph R. Landrey, chief Middle East correspondent for the United Press, reported from Damascus on May 3rd: "This election will test the hopes of right-wing elements to seize power and lead Syria down the anti-communist path taken by Jordan."

The election campaign has been very intense. Both sides have stated their opposition to the Eisenhower Doctrine and imperialism. However, Landrey pointed out: "Left-wing elements have clearly stated that the United States and the Eisenhower Doctrine are imperialism. The right-wing elements have so far avoided specifying who they are referring to when they speak of imperialists."

In Damascus, the competition is between Ri'ad Malqi, brother of Adnan Malqi, the former Syrian Army Chief of Staff who was assassinated by imperialists in 1955, and Mustafa Siba'i, leader of the Muslim Brotherhood. Campaign slogans in the streets say: "Malqi is an enemy of the Eisenhower Doctrine and imperialism," and "Elect Dr. Siba'i to eliminate those who do not believe in religion."

On the eve of the election, Western news agencies continuously "predicted" that violence might break out and that the election might be rigged. However, Landrey admitted that there were no signs of rigging as of May 3rd.

The Syrian government has already lifted martial law in the areas where the by-elections are being held in order to provide a free atmosphere for the election. President Kuwatly ordered on May 3rd that no demonstrations be held in these four cities during the election period.

### 大马士革等四城市  议员补缺选举竞争激烈

    大马士革等四城市
    议员补缺选举竞争激烈
    新华社4日讯　大马士革消息：叙利亚的大马士革、霍姆斯、苏韦达和德鲁士山城四个城市今天举行议员补缺选举。这次补缺选举是要填补今年2月间由于阴谋推翻政府而被判刑的四名议员的席位。
    由于最近的约旦事件，这次补缺选举受到普遍的注意。华盛顿的官员们已经明白表示希望约旦事件在叙利亚重演。合众社驻中东首席记者兰德雷3日从大马士革报道说：“这次竞选将考验右翼分子对于取得政权和使叙利亚走约旦所采取的反共道路的希望。”
    竞选运动十分激烈。双方都表示自己反对艾森豪威尔主义和帝国主义。但是，兰德雷指出：“左翼分子指明美国和艾森豪威尔主义是帝国主义。右翼分子到现在为止一直避免说明他们所说的帝国主义者是何所指。”
    在大马士革，竞争在1955年被帝国主义者暗杀的叙利亚前陆军参谋长阿德南·马尔基的兄弟里阿德·马尔基和穆斯林兄弟会的领袖穆斯塔法·西巴伊之间进行。街头的竞选标语说：“马尔基是艾森豪威尔主义和帝国主义的敌人”，“选举西巴伊博士来消灭不信宗教的人”。
    西方通讯社在选举前夕不断地“预测”选举可能爆发暴力事件和选举可能被操纵。但是兰德雷承认，到3日为止还看不到被操纵的迹象。
    叙利亚政府早已在举行补缺选举的地方取消了戒严令，以便为选举提供自由的气氛。库阿特利总统3日下令禁止这四个城市在选举期间举行任何示威。
