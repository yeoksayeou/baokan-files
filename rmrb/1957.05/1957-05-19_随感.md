    In the past few days, some new terms related to rectification have appeared in the newspapers. One is called "contradiction queueing." Everything is about queueing, and dealing with internal contradictions among the people is also being put in a queue. This term is indeed vivid. Judging from its original meaning, it must be to list all the contradictions in the unit, classify them according to their nature, and prioritize them, so that when resolving them, there is a sense of importance and urgency.

    But because the term is very new, misunderstandings are inevitable. I heard someone say, "Alas! I don't know which rank our contradictions are in. I don't know when it will be our turn to expose and solve them!"

    Although it is a misunderstanding, it reveals a message: contradictions are widespread, and in some places, they have accumulated a lot. Seeing the leaders putting on an air of "there is no bad habit here, no need to worry," with faces as stern as "Mount Tai stone dare to be," people are a little anxious.

    There is another new term called "closed-door rectification." There doesn't seem to be any misunderstanding about this, but there seems to be another interpretation. One is that it violates the instruction of "rectification and work should not be delayed," and the other is the meaning of "idlers go back to work."

    The latter is mostly unnecessary worry. It is said to be unnecessary because the rectification instructions also stipulate: non-Party members are welcome to participate.

    But any worry has a basis in life. To say nothing else, just look at very ordinary housework, and there is this situation: which child is accustomed to bullying people, and the neighbors complain to the parents, some parents like to use the method of closed-door discipline, and when the child opens the door, he still bullies people. — This makes people suspect that his parents will listen to one side of the story behind the door, and out of affection, give a few painless and irrelevant scoldings and be done with it.

    All metaphors are difficult to be appropriate; the more inappropriate this metaphor is, the better.

    这几天的报上，出现了好些有关整风的新词。有一个叫作“矛盾排队”。什么都讲排队，处理人民内部矛盾也来排排队，这个词着实形象化。审其原意，谅必是把本单位所有的矛盾，罗列出来，按其性质，分个先后，以便解决的时候，也好有个轻重缓急之分。
    但因为词儿极新，难免产生误解，我就听见有人说：“唉！咱们这儿的矛盾不知排在哪一档上，还不知要等到哪天才轮着来揭发解决呢？”
    虽然是误解，却也透露了一个消息：矛盾是普遍存在的，有些地方还积累得不少，看看领导者却摆出一副“此地无歪风、不劳多费心”的神气，把面孔板得像“泰山石敢当”一样，人们就很有点儿着急。
    还有一个新词，叫做“关门整风”。这倒不见有什么误解，但似乎原有别解。一种是违背了“整风和工作两不误”的指示之谓，一种是“闲人回开”的意思。
    后一种大抵属于多余的担心，说它多余，因为整风指示也已规定：欢迎非党员参加。
    但任何担心，总有生活的根据。别的不说，单看极普通的家务事，就有这种情形：哪个孩子惯于欺负人，街坊向家长申诉，有些家长爱用关门训子法，等到孩子开门出来，仍旧欺负人。——这就令人怀疑他的家长在门内会不会听了一面之词，舐犊情深，不痛不痒地训了几句完事。
    凡有比喻，都难恰当；这个比喻，越不恰当越好。
