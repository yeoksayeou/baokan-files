Xinhua News Agency, May 12th - According to TASS, May 11th: Soviet Ambassador to Japan, Tevosian, delivered a memorandum to Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi on May 9th. In the memorandum, the Soviet government suggested that the Soviet and Japanese governments jointly appeal to the governments of the United States and the United Kingdom to conclude an agreement on the immediate prohibition of testing atomic and hydrogen weapons, or even to conclude an agreement on the cessation of such tests for a specified period. The Soviet government also expressed its readiness to study any other joint steps aimed at effectively stopping the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons.

The memorandum described the recent exchange of views between the Soviet and Japanese governments on the issue of banning atomic and hydrogen weapon tests. The memorandum stated that on March 9th, the Japanese Embassy in Moscow handed the Soviet Foreign Ministry a note from the Japanese government. The note pointed out that the Soviet Union's nuclear weapon tests had not been preceded by prior notification, and the Japanese government requested in the note that the Soviet government cease testing any type of nuclear weapon in the future.

In its reply to Japan on March 29th, the Soviet government stated that the Soviet Union consistently advocated the complete prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons, advocated the elimination of these weapons from the arsenals of all countries, and was prepared to immediately abandon testing atomic and hydrogen weapons when other major powers undertook the obligation to stop testing atomic and hydrogen weapons. In order to stop the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons as quickly as possible, the Soviet government also proposed to the United Nations that this issue be resolved separately from the overall disarmament plan.

Since the Western countries possessing atomic and hydrogen weapons have not expressed their readiness to accept the above-mentioned Soviet proposal, the Soviet government proposed the conclusion of an agreement on the cessation of testing such weapons for a specified period as the first step towards a complete ban on testing atomic and hydrogen weapons. However, this proposal of the Soviet government has not yet received the support of Western countries. This attitude of the Western countries towards the Soviet proposal has forced the Soviet Union to pay necessary attention to the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons in order to consolidate its own security.

On April 20th, Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Suemitsu Kadowaki, again raised this issue in a conversation with Khrushchev. In the conversation, Khrushchev advocated that the Soviet Union and Japan jointly propose to the United States and the United Kingdom the issue of banning atomic and hydrogen weapons and stopping the testing of such weapons. Kadowaki declared that the Soviet Union and Japan had the same goal in the struggle to ban atomic and hydrogen weapons and to stop the testing of such weapons.

The memorandum said that the Soviet government, taking into account the importance of this issue and giving a fair assessment of the Japanese government's position, had put forward the above-mentioned proposal.

    苏联建议日苏联合向美英呼吁  缔结关于立即禁止核武器协定
    新华社12日讯　据塔斯社11日讯：苏联驻日本大使捷沃西安5月9日向日本首相岸信介递交了一份备忘录，苏联政府在备忘录中建议以苏联政府和日本政府的名义，联合向美英两国政府呼吁缔结关于立即禁止试验原子武器和氢武器的协定，或者那怕是缔结关于在规定的期限内停止这种试验的协定。苏联政府还表示准备研究任何其他目的在于有效地停止试验原子武器和氢武器的共同步骤。
    这项备忘录叙述了苏日两国政府最近就禁止试验原子武器和氢武器问题交换意见的情况。备忘录说，3月9日，日本驻莫斯科大使馆曾经交给苏联外交部一份日本政府的照会。照会指出，苏联试验核武器没有经过预先通知，日本政府在照会中要求苏联政府以后停止试验任何种类的核武器。
    苏联政府在3月29日复照日本，声明苏联一贯主张完全禁止原子武器和氢武器，主张在各国军备中取缔这些武器，并且准备在其他大国一担当起停止试验原子武器和氢武器这种义务的时候，就立即放弃试验原子武器和氢武器。为了最快地停止试验原子武器和氢武器，苏联政府还向联合国提出把这个问题与总的裁军计划分开来加以单独解决的建议。
    由于拥有原子武器和氢武器的西方国家，不表示准备接受上述的苏联建议，苏联政府提出缔结关于在规定的期限内停止试验这类武器的协定作为完全禁止试验原子武器和氢武器的第一步。但是苏联政府的这个建议直到现在还没有获得西方国家的支持。西方国家对苏联建议的这种态度，使得苏联为了巩固自己的安全，不得不对试验原子武器和氢武器给予必要的注意。
    4月20日，日本驻苏联大使门胁季光在同赫鲁晓夫的谈话中又提到这个问题。赫鲁晓夫在谈话中主张苏联和日本向美英两国共同提出关于禁止原子武器和氢武器以及停止这种武器试验的问题。门胁季光声言苏联和日本在争取禁止原子武器和氢武器以及停止这种武器的试验的斗争中目的是一致的。
    备忘录说，苏联政府考虑到这个问题的重要性，对日本政府的立场予以公正的评价，提出了上述建议。
