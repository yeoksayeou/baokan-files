Xinhua News Agency dispatch. It is reported that Nowair, the former Jordanian Army Chief of Staff who took refuge in Syria, telegraphed Saudi Arabian King Saud from Damascus, urging him to stop involving his troops in the conspiracy in Jordan to avoid Muslim bloodshed. Nowair said: "What is happening in Jordan now is by no means an internal problem, but a conspiracy aimed at using your name and your army." He said: "I can assure you that what is happening in Jordan is a dirty colonialist conspiracy aimed at expanding the Baghdad Pact against Saudi Arabia and its king, in order to drag Jordan into it." Nowair said, "Your Majesty's name and army are being used as tools of this conspiracy." He said that "Your army, originally sent to Jordan to defend the country from Zionist aggression, was once welcomed by the Jordanian people, but now, in the eyes of the people, it is considered to be serving the purposes of individuals and colonialists. ... The anger of the Jordanian people may erupt at any moment."

Beirut dispatch: US Sixth Fleet Marines landed in Beirut, the capital of Lebanon, on the morning of April 30. Six US transport ships carrying more than 1,800 officers and men of the US Marine Corps Second Battalion entered the port of Beirut at 9:00 a.m. on April 30 and held a landing ceremony. Jones, the political officer of the transport ship "Mount McKinley," said, "We are ready to open the way into trouble areas if necessary." At the same time, the other fifty warships of the Sixth Fleet held so-called air defense exercises outside the port of Beirut, only one hundred miles from Beirut. The commander of the fleet, Brown, said in a conversation that the fleet was prepared, as usual, for "big wars, small wars, or medium-sized wars." He said threateningly, "We can whisper, and we can roar."

At the same time, Turkey is also making trouble. The "New York Times" of April 30 published a dispatch from its Ankara reporter saying, "In the past two days, Turkish troops have been heavily concentrated on the Syrian border." The news said: "The elite 5th Armored Brigade of the Turkish Second Army Corps stationed outside Ankara has moved to the Syrian border." The Ankara military headquarters refused to comment on the matter, but sources revealed that "people with close ties to the government" said that Turkey was doing this to support the pro-Western Jordanian government and to force Syria to "restrain" itself in the changing situation in Jordan.

    诺瓦尔呼吁沙特国王
    不要卷入约旦阴谋
    美国陆战队已在贝鲁特登陆
    本报综合报道  据新华社消息，避难到叙利亚的约旦前陆军参谋长诺瓦尔从大马士革打电报给沙特阿拉伯国王沙特，呼吁他制止把他的军队卷入在约旦的阴谋中，以避免穆斯林的流血。诺瓦尔说：“约旦现在发生的事情绝不是一个内部问题，而是一个目的在于利用你的名义和你的军队的阴谋。”他说：“我可以向你保证，正在约旦发生的事情是一个肮脏的殖民主义阴谋，其目的在于扩大针对着沙特阿拉伯和它的国王的巴格达条约，以便把约旦卷进去。”诺瓦尔说，“陛下的名字和军队正在被利用来作为这个阴谋的工具。”他说，原来派遣到约旦去保卫这个国家使它免受犹太复国主义侵害的“你的军队曾经是受约旦人民欢迎的，现在，在人民眼中，它已经被认为是为个人和殖民者的目的服务的了。……约旦人民的愤怒随时随刻都可能爆发。”
    贝鲁特消息：美国第六舰队的海军陆战队4月30日上午在黎巴嫩首都贝鲁特登陆。六艘美国运输舰载着美国海军陆战队第二营的一千八百多名官兵在4月30日上午九时进入贝鲁特港后，就举行了上岸仪式。“麦金雷山号”运输舰的政务官琼斯说，“我们已经准备好在必要时打开道路，进入出了乱子的地区”。与此同时，第六舰队的其它五十艘军舰在贝鲁特港外举行了所谓防空演习，它们离开贝鲁特只有一百英里。这个舰队的司令布朗在一次谈话中说，这支舰队像通常一样，准备进行“大战、小战或者不大不小的战争”。他带着威胁的语调说，“我们能够低声细语，我们也能高声大吼”。
    同时，土耳其也在蠢蠢欲动，4月30日的“纽约时报”登载了它驻安卡拉的记者发回的一条消息说，“在前两天里，土耳其的军队在叙利亚边境大量集中”。这条消息说：“驻扎在安卡拉外面的土耳其第二军团的精锐的第五装甲旅已经开往叙利亚边境”，安卡拉的军事司令部拒绝谈论这个问题，不过消息透露“与政府有密切关系的人士”的话说，土耳其这样做是为了支持亲西方的约旦政府，并且压迫叙利亚在约旦局势变动中“克制”自己。
