Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 3rd May: This morning, Gao Feng, First Secretary of the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Secretaries Chen Sigong and Zhang Guosheng, Qinghai Province Vice Governors Sun Junyi and Xue Keming, the leaders of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Qinghai Gao Langting, Sun Guang, Zhong Shengyi and a division commander and political commissar, together with more than 400 party member leading cadres, cadres, and soldiers, went to Xiaoxia Township in the eastern suburbs of Xining to join the peasants' production drought resistance team to help them dig and repair channels.
    The channel body of this canal is in the middle of the hillside, and the mountain is quite steep. It takes a lot of effort to climb up because there is a lot of earth dug out. However, these leading cadres climbed up with other cadres and soldiers and worked for five hours.
    These leading cadres, while working happily, talked about the vivid scenes of the great production movement in the anti-Japanese base areas from 1939 to 1942, and also challenged and teased each other.
    When the provincial party secretaries spoke to reporters, they said: We must follow the instructions of the Party Central Committee in the future, and stipulate that leading cadres should take some time to participate in physical labor and persist in it. The army leaders also expressed that they would carry forward the fine traditions of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and in addition to taking some time to participate in labor, they would also mobilize all officers and soldiers to engage in production activities such as growing vegetables, and help the masses in production during the busy farming season, develop a habit of loving labor, and further improve the relationship between the army and the people.
    In the afternoon, all the party, government, and military leading cadres formed three groups and held close talks with the peasants and township cadres on the construction site.

    青海负责干部参加抗旱队伍
    新华社西宁3日电　今日上午，中共青海省委员会第一书记高峰，书记陈思恭、张国声，青海省副省长孙君一、薛克明，中国人民解放军驻青海部队首长高朗亭、孙光、锺生镒和某师师长、政治委员等党员负责干部和干部、战士共四百多人，前往西宁市东郊小峡乡参加农民的生产抗旱队伍，帮助他们挖修渠道。
    这条渠道的渠身在半山腰中，山势相当陡，挖出的土又很多，爬上去要费很大力气。但是，这些领导干部们和其他干部、战士一道爬了上去，劳动了五个小时。
    这些领导干部们一面愉快地劳动，一面谈论着1939年到1942年抗日根据地大生产运动时的生动情景，还互相挑战和取笑。
    省委书记们在对记者谈话时说：我们今后一定要遵照党中央的指示，把领导干部抽出一定时间参加体力劳动订成制度并坚持下去。部队首长们也表示，要发扬中国人民解放军的优良传统，除自己抽出一定时间参加劳动外，还要发动全体官兵从事种菜等生产活动和在农忙时节帮助群众生产，养成热爱劳动的习惯，进一步改善军民关系。
    下午，全体党政军负责干部组成三个小组，分别和工地上的农民和乡干部进行了亲密的交谈。
