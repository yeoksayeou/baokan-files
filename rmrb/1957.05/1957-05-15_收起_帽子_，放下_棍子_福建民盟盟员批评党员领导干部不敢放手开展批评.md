Put Away the "Hats," Put Down the "Sticks"
Fujian Democratic League Members Criticize Party Member Leaders for Not Daring to Let Go and Carry Out Criticism

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 14th. Xinhua News Agency reporters Xiao Huang and Lin Jiahuan reported: The Fujian Provincial Committee and Fuzhou Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League jointly held a symposium on the 12th, criticizing the current situation in Fujian Province where some Communist Party member leaders are still unable to let go and launch criticism, describing this situation as "half-opening the door to the wind." They believe that to fully open the door, Communist Party member leaders must put down their "official airs" and listen to criticism with humility and sincerity.

Many League members working in universities said at the symposium that some Party member leaders in universities, and even political counselors in departments, actually accused older professors of being "backward elements" to their faces. Some leaders like people who flatter them in person, but dislike those who dare to offer opinions to their faces. They even believe that criticizing Party member leaders is "dissatisfaction with the Party," which makes many people afraid and unwilling to offer opinions anymore.

At the symposium, everyone believed that it was very wise and timely for the Central Committee of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao to propose carrying out the rectification movement at this time. However, they said, there are currently concerns about the rectification movement on both sides. Communist Party member leaders are afraid of being "rectified," so some are perfunctory when conveying Chairman Mao's instructions on correctly handling contradictions among the people, or emphasize "improving understanding before connecting with reality," and are hesitant to "let go"; democratic personages are afraid that Party members will still not change after they offer opinions, and may even be retaliated against in the future. At the same time, they are also afraid that some opinions may not be correct and will be "grasped by the pigtails" or even "hit with sticks." They are most afraid that "Beijing dialect" will become "local dialect" when it is transmitted to the local level (meaning that when the central instructions are implemented at the local grassroots level, there will be deviations). They said that now we should put away the "hats," put down the "sticks," seek truth from facts, and truly act in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions.

The League members said in the symposium that only by being open and honest, respecting each other, can estrangement be eliminated and unity be strengthened.

### 收起“帽子”，放下“棍子”  福建民盟盟员批评党员领导干部不敢放手开展批评

    收起“帽子”，放下“棍子”
    福建民盟盟员批评党员领导干部不敢放手开展批评
    新华社福州14日电　新华社记者肖璜、林嘉煌报道：中国民主同盟福建省委员会和福州市委员会12日联合举行了一个座谈会，对福建省目前一些共产党员领导干部还不能放手发动批评的状况提出批评，形容这种状况是“迎风户半开”。他们认为，要把门户大开，就要共产党员领导干部放下“官架子”，虚心诚恳地听取批评。
    许多在高等学校工作的盟员在座谈会上说，高等学校中的某些党员领导干部，甚至系的政治辅导员，竟当面指责年老教授为“落后分子”。某些领导者喜欢当面恭维的人，而不喜欢敢于当面提意见的人。甚至认为对党员领导干部提出批评就是“对党不满”，因而使不少人不敢和不愿再提出意见。
    座谈会上大家认为，共产党中央和毛主席在目前提出开展整风运动是非常英明的、适时的。但是，他们说，目前对整风运动两方面都有顾虑。共产党员领导干部怕挨“整”，因此有的在传达毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的指示时，草草了事，或者强调“提高认识再联系实际”，迟迟不敢“放”；民主人士怕提了意见后党员仍旧不改，甚至将来遭到报复。同时他们也怕有些意见提得不一定正确，会反过来被抓“辫子”，甚至挨“棍子”。他们最怕“北京话”传到地方就变成了“本地话”（意即中央指示贯彻到地方基层执行时就有偏差）。他们说，现在应该收起“帽子”，放下“棍子”，实事求是，真正按照毛主席的指示办事。
    盟员们在座谈中说，只有开诚布公，互相尊重，隔阂才能消除，团结才会加强。
