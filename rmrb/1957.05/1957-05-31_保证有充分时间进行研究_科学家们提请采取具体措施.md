    Guarantee Sufficient Time for Research
    Scientists Propose Concrete Measures
    This newspaper reports that at the Second Plenary Session of the Academic Divisions of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Qian Jiaju and twenty-six other scientists submitted a proposal requesting the Academy to take concrete measures to ensure that academicians and other senior researchers have sufficient time for scientific research.
    The proposal suggests that the Academy consult with relevant departments and adopt appropriate measures to establish necessary systems to ensure that each academician and other senior researchers have sufficient time to engage in research work. The proposed methods are as follows:
    I. Consult with the United Front Work Department and other relevant parties to effectively reduce scientists' social and political activities. The specific methods are: (1) Each People's Representative or CPPCC member, whether national or local, should hold at most one position in total; (2) Reception work for foreign guests should be limited to one aspect for each person, and the past practice of concentrating this work on a few people should be resolutely changed. Scientists should be sent to meet foreign guests at train stations and airports as little as possible; (3) Unnecessary gatherings for scientists should be minimized. Some major reports (such as mobilization rallies to arrange a certain campaign, or report-back meetings of People's Congress and CPPCC meetings) can be replaced with written documents, which should be distributed instead of holding large meetings; (4) Regular social activity gatherings should be strictly scheduled on a fixed date each week; (5) For temporary gatherings, the content of the meeting should be clearly stated in the notice. Scientists who feel it is not absolutely necessary to participate, or who have already participated in meetings of a similar nature, may not participate; (6) The time for meetings and major reports should be strictly limited. Meetings should generally be limited to a maximum of three hours, and major reports to a maximum of two hours. For reports that are content-poor, full of empty talk, or recite documents, the audience has the freedom to leave at any time; (7) For older scientists over the age of sixty, it is best to relieve them of all administrative duties and allow them to use their only ten or twenty years to write down what they know.
    II. Effectively guarantee fixed research time each year, and reduce or relieve the burden of administrative duties (including academic administrative duties). The methods are as follows: (1) Each academician or other senior researcher holding administrative positions should have at least six months of continuous research time each year, or three months of continuous research time in the first and second half of the year respectively. During this period, they should be allowed not to participate in any other social or political activities (they can ask relevant parties for leave); (2) Administrative positions in scientific research institutions, universities, or state organs should adopt a system of rotational responsibility among the principal and deputy heads to ensure that they can concentrate on research work during their fixed research time each year; (3) A system of sabbatical leave for one year after five years of work should be established; (4) For academicians teaching in universities, they should be avoided from bearing too many or too heavy teaching tasks and supervising graduate students, to ensure that they have the necessary research time.
    III. After the above methods are decided upon through consultation with all relevant parties, they should be submitted to the State Council for approval and corresponding regulations should be formulated and notified to all relevant departments nationwide for implementation.
    The Plenary Session of the Academic Divisions of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has agreed to submit this proposal to the State Council for research and handling.

    保证有充分时间进行研究
    科学家们提请采取具体措施
    本报讯　在中国科学院学部委员会第二次全体会议上，千家驹等二十七位科学家提出了一项请院部采取具体措施以保证学部委员及其他高级研究人员有充分时间进行科学研究的提案。
    这项提案建议院部与有关部门协商，采取适当措施，建立必要的制度，以保证每一学部委员及其他高级研究人员均有充分时间从事研究工作。提案提出的办法如下：
    一、与统战部及其他有关方面协商，切实减少科学家的社会政治活动，其具体办法是：（1）人民代表或政协委员，不论全国的或地方的，每人总共至多担任一职；（2）外宾招待工作，每人以一个方面的对象为限，应坚决改变过去将此项工作集中于少数人的情况，赴车站、飞机场迎送外宾，应尽量减少派科学家前去；（3）对于科学家，应尽量减少他们不必要的集会，有些大报告（如布置某项运动的动员大会，人代、政协会议的传达报告会等）可用书面文件代替者，即分发文件，而不必举行大会；（4）经常性社会活动的集会，应严格规定在每周的一定日期举行；（5）临时性的集会，在通知上应写明会议内容，科学家认为没有十分必要参加的，或已参加过类似性质会议的，可以不参加；（6）开会及做大报告时间应予严格限制，开会一般最多以三小时为限，做大报告以二小时为限；那种内容贫乏、空话连篇或背诵文件的报告，听众有随时退席的自由；（7）对于年在六十以上的老科学家，最好解除其一切行政职务，让他们利用自己仅有的十年二十年写出他们所知道的东西。
    二、切实保证每年固定的研究时间，并减轻或解除行政职务（包括学术性的行政职务在内）的负担，其办法如下：（1）每一学部委员或其他担任行政职务的高级研究人员，每年至少应有六个月连续研究的时间或上下半年各有三个月连续研究的时间，在此期间，他们应被允许不参加其他任何社会政治活动（可向有关方面请假）；（2）科学研究机关、高等学校或国家机关的行政职务，在正副主管人员间，应采取轮流负责制，以保证在每年的固定研究时间内专心从事研究工作；（3）应该建立工作五年休假进修一年的制度；（4）对在高等学校担任教学的学部委员，应避免使他们负担过多过重的教学任务和指导研究生的任务，以保证他们有必要的研究时间。
    三、以上办法，经与各有关方面协议决定后，应提请国务院批准并制订相应条例，通知全国各有关部门施行。
    中国科学院学部委员会全体会议已同意将这项提案送请国务院研究办理。
