Creating New Experiences in Party-Masses Relations
    ——Mr. Qian Duansheng, President of Beijing University of Political Science and Law, Talks About Rectification——

    Recently, the reporter visited Mr. Qian Duansheng, President of Beijing University of Political Science and Law, and asked him about his thoughts on the rectification movement.

                      Joy and Fear

    “Joy and fear” is Mr. Qian's summary of his feelings. Through the ongoing rectification movement, Mr. Qian foresaw the emergence of a better, new relationship between the Party and non-Party members. He said: "The sixteen-character slogan proposed by Chairman Mao, 'Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend,' 'Long-term coexistence, mutual supervision,' reflects the current social situation in our country, a practical need; especially the latter eight characters, it is possible for us to change from spontaneously to more consciously creating a new experience of our own for the relationship between the Party and non-Party members during the period of socialist construction. From this perspective, rectification is very necessary." This is the aspect that makes Mr. Qian feel happy. What he fears is that "from the proposal of the General Line to the current rectification, everyone feels more and more that their responsibilities are heavier, and their burdens are heavier, especially after the rectification, it can be expected that the activities of party members will be more organized, and the activities of non-Party democratic figures in state organs and society will also increase and become richer, thus worrying that they will not be able to keep up with the inevitably increased tasks." Therefore, Mr. Qian believes that "in addition to strictly demanding the Communist Party, democratic parties and non-Party figures should also spend more effort and think of more ways to strengthen themselves under the leadership of the Communist Party."

          In the Past, Old Professors and Old Judicial Personnel Were Not Respected Enough

    The topic then turned to some problems in Mr. Qian's own administrative law work. He believes that "Legislation is an urgent task at present. Courts and procuratorate departments need to have laws to follow. Currently, there are conditions to do it, but it is being done too slowly and not boldly and freely enough." In terms of judicial work – he said, the quality of case handling is a key issue. In 1954, the quality of case handling improved rapidly, but it was still not commensurate with social progress. To improve the quality of case handling, the first thing to do is to improve the legal knowledge and professional level of the relevant staff, but at present, due to the small educational force and the insufficient number of higher political and legal departments, attention should be paid to cultivating qualified teachers, increasing departments and correspondence courses. He believes that "at present, research work that is not very relevant to teaching should be placed in a secondary position, and don't engage in research for the sake of research, reversing priorities." In addition, "quick and effective methods should be adopted to compile legal textbooks so that the majority of teachers have more time to teach."
    Regarding the shortcomings in the relationship between the Party and non-Party members in the political and legal departments, Mr. Qian believes that: one is that some Party member cadres do not consult enough with non-Party members when something happens, and the other is that there is a lack of necessary trust and respect for old judicial personnel and old professors. He gave two examples. One is about insufficient consultation, for example, the legislative work mentioned above - Mr. Qian said that if opinions from all parties can be widely solicited, it may be done faster. I also serve as the deputy director of the Legislative Affairs Committee of the National People's Congress. Because I am not a full-time position, I am less involved. The responsible comrades of the Party have indeed worked hard and done many specific tasks, but they have not consulted well on issues such as working methods and principles. I only learned from another cadre whether the draft of the general principles of the criminal law was recently proposed. The other is about the lack of trust in old teachers. When Professor Lou Bangyan was at Beijing University of Political Science and Law, Mr. Qian proposed that he serve as the deputy director of a teaching and research section, but it took three times to resolve it. "Therefore, the lack of trust and respect for old political and legal cadres and old professors," he said, "is due to the past emphasis on the strong class struggle nature of the law, and special attention to the political conditions of political and legal cadres, which is of course correct, but it also often makes participation in the Party or League the boundary for measuring whether a person is politically progressive. Such a line easily makes people in the political and legal departments become a single color. In 1954, some graduates of Beijing University of Political Science and Law who were not Party or League members were not assigned to work in political and legal departments, or those who could have been considered as judges were made clerks. It has been better since 1955, and the number of non-Party members in the judicial departments has increased, and some non-Party members have served as directors of the judicial bureaus." However, there are still few non-Party members among the senior cadres of the courts and procuratorates, so some should be appropriately increased. He said, "There are benefits to doing this. One is that there are always some people who do not join the Party. Since there are, they should be given appropriate consideration, otherwise it will limit their enthusiasm; the other is to consolidate the emotions of young people studying political science and law, so as to avoid them feeling that there is no hope for the future."

                Relying Only on Party Members, Not Teachers

    Mr. Qian then talked about higher education. He said: "In the past few years, we have learned a lot from the Soviet Union, but we have also produced shortcomings such as insufficient integration with China's reality and insufficient consultation with old teachers. In schools, we only rely on Party members, not enough on teachers. The Ministry of Higher Education, on certain issues, such as the adjustment of departments, teaching reform, professional settings, teaching workload, etc., comes up with a set of things first, and pushes it down from above. Even if it is handed down for discussion, there can only be minor modifications. Therefore, from top to bottom, without relying on the majority of teachers and without combining with reality, it is a basic problem in higher education. In this way, non-Party teachers are also prone to have opinions about the leadership."

    Mr. Qian believes that the implementation of the Party committee system in schools easily makes the leadership of the school run two sets of institutions: one is the Party committee, and the other is institutions such as the school affairs committee, which inevitably makes several Party member responsible comrades do many repetitive tasks and waste a lot of time. Therefore, he believes that: "Schools can do without the leadership of the Party committee, but be led by the school affairs committee, which saves a lot of trouble. The leading comrades of the Party in the school must assume the political and ideological leadership of Party members and non-Party members, so not having the Party committee system does not mean that the Party does not lead."

        Adopt Flexible Ways to Ensure That Both Rectification and Education Work Are Not Affected

    Mr. Qian also believes that the idea of having a central task in schools is not good, which may hinder regular work. He said: "The central task of the school is education work, which is constantly being carried out. We can only use other central tasks to strengthen education work, and we cannot use other central tasks to put education work in a secondary position. If education work is squeezed out by other work, the school will not be a school." How to ensure that both rectification and education work are not affected in schools, Mr. Qian believes, is a problem that should be solved. He said: "The organs can ensure that both are not affected, but it is not possible to come up with ordinary statements in schools. The regular work of the school cannot be disrupted. Of course, rectification must also be carried out. Therefore, we can consider adopting more flexible ways to ensure that both are not affected."

    The reporter wanted to inquire about the relationship between the Party and the masses at Beijing University of Political Science and Law. Perhaps it was out of love and virtue, Mr. Qian did not talk much about it. However, the reporter has also heard people say that the building where the old professors of Beijing University of Political Science and Law used to live was called "isolated island." At a recent forum at the University of Political Science and Law, a professor said humorously: "After I came to the University of Political Science and Law, I felt that it was not like a school. Some people said it was like a political power organ, but I don't think it is. It is more like a military organ. Recently, some people said that Peking University is like a yamen. I think it would be nice if our school could be like a yamen like Peking University." This shows that Beijing University of Political Science and Law is not calm and uneventful. In this school, the wind has finally blown, but I don't know if it can ripple a pool of spring water, which depends on how the Party in the school acts.　　　Ye Mai

    为党群关系创造新经验
    ——北京政法学院院长钱端升先生谈整风——
    最近记者走访了北京政法学院院长钱端升先生，请他谈谈对整风运动的感想。
                      一喜一惧
    “一则以喜，一则以惧”，这是钱先生对他的感想的总结语。透过正在开展的整风运动，钱先生瞻望到了更好的新的党与非党关系的出现。他说：“毛主席提出的‘百花齐放，百家争鸣’、‘长期共存，互相监督’这十六个字的口号，反映了我国当前社会的一种局面，一种实际需要；特别是后面八个字，有可能使我们由自发变为更自觉地来为社会主义建设时期的党与非党的关系，创造出一种新的我们自己的经验。从这方面讲，整风是十分需要的”。这是钱先生感到喜欢的一面。惧的是，“从总路线的提出到目前的整风为止，愈来愈感到大家的责任重了，负担重了，尤其是经过整风，可以预期到党员的活动会更有组织些，非党的民主人士在国家机关和社会上的活动也将有增加而更丰富了，因而耽心自己跟不上必然增加的任务”。所以，钱先生认为，“除严格要求共产党之外，民主党派和非党人士，也应在共产党领导之下，多花一些力量，多想一些办法，加强自己”。
          过去对老教授和老司法人员尊重不够
    话题接着转到了钱先生的本行政法工作中的一些问题。他认为：“立法是当前的一件紧要工作，法院和检察部门都需要有法可依，目前也有条件来搞，可是现在搞的嫌慢些，不够大胆和放手。”在司法工作方面——他说，办案质量是一个关键性问题，1954年办案质量有较快的提高，但同社会进步相比还是不相称的。而要提高办案质量，首先要提高有关工作人员的法律知识和业务水平，但目前由于教育力量太小，高等政法院系还不够多，所以目前应注意培养合乎规格的教师，增设院系和函授班。他认为：“目前应把与教学不大相关的研究工作放在次要地位，不要为研究而研究，轻重倒置”。此外“应采取快而有效的方法把法律教科书编写出来，使广大教师有更多时间来教课”。
    政法部门党与非党关系上存在的缺点，钱先生认为：一是有些党员干部遇事同党外人士商量不够，一是对于老的司法人员和老教授缺乏必要的信任和尊重。他举出了两个例子。一个是关于商量不够的，譬如，上面提到的立法工作——钱先生说，如果能广泛征求各方面的意见，就可能搞的快些。我兼任全国人民代表大会法案委员会副主任委员，因不是专职就过问的较少，党员负责同志的确辛辛苦苦地作了许多具体工作，但在工作方法和原则等问题上也没有很好商量，连刑法总则草案最近是否提出一事，我还是从另外一个干部口中知道的。再一个是关于对老教师不大信任的，楼邦彦教授在北京政法学院时，钱先生曾提出让他担任一个教研室的副主任，但前后说了三次才得到解决。“所以对老的政法干部和老教授信任和尊重不够，”他说：“则是由于过去强调法律的阶级性斗争性强，对于政法干部特别注重政治条件，这当然是对的，但也往往因此而把参加党团与否，作为衡量一个人政治上是否进步的界限。这样一条线，容易使政法部门的人变成清一色。1954年北京政法学院的毕业生，有些不是党团员的就没有分配到政法部门工作，或本来可以考虑当审判员的让他们当了书记员。1955年以后比较好些，司法部门中的非党人员增多了，并由一些非党人士担任司法厅局长的职务”。但法院和检察院的高级干部中还很少有非党人士，因此应适当地增加一些。他说，“这样做是有好处的，一则不参加党的人总是有的，既然有，就应当给他们以适当的估计，不然就会限制他们的积极性；一则也可巩固学习政法专业的青年人的情绪，免得他们有前途无望之感”。
                只依靠党员，不依靠教师
    钱先生接着谈到了高等教育工作。他说：“这几年来，我们学习苏联有很大的成就，但也产生了和中国实际结合不够，和老教师商量不够的缺点。在学校中只是依靠党员，而依靠教师不够。高教部在某些问题上，如院系调整、教学改革、专业设置、教学工作量等，都是自己先拿出一套东西，从上往下贯，即使交下边讨论，也只能有小小的修改，所以，自上而下，不依靠广大教师，不结合实际，是高等教育工作中的一个基本的毛病。这样一来，非党的教师也容易对领导有意见”。
    钱先生认为学校中实行党委制，易使学校的领导搞两套：一边是党委会，一边是校务委员会一类机构，势必使几个党员负责同志多做许多重复的工作，浪费很多时间。因此他认为：“学校可以不要党委领导，而由校务委员会领导，这样省事得多。学校党的领导同志总得对党员和非党人士担负起政治思想领导，所以不要党委制并不是说党不领导了”。
        采取灵活方式保证整风和教育工作两不误
    钱先生还认为，在学校中有中心工作的提法不好，可能妨碍经常工作。他说：“学校的中心工作就是教育工作，这是经常在进行的，只能拿别的中心工作来加强教育工作，不能拿别的中心工作来把教育工作放在次要地位。要是教育工作被旁的工作挤了，学校就不成其为学校了”。在学校中如何保证整风和教育工作两不误，钱先生认为是一个应该解决的问题。他说：“机关可以保证两不误，而在学校拿出普通的提法就不行，学校的经常工作不能打乱，当然整风也得搞，因此可考虑采取一些更灵活的方式来保证两不误。”
    记者想探询一下北京政法学院的党群关系如何，大概是出于爱人以德之故吧，钱先生没有多谈。但是，记者也曾听人说过，过去北京政法学院老教授们住的一座楼，被称为“孤岛”。在最近政法学院的座谈会上，一个教授幽默地说：“我到政法学院来后，觉得不像一个学校，有人说像一个政权机关，我看也不像，倒更像一个军事机关。最近有人说北大像一个衙门，我看我们学校能像北大那样一个衙门也不错。”这就说明北京政法学院并不是平静无事的。在这个学校里，风毕竟是刮起来了，但不知能否吹皱一池春水，这就要看学校的党如何行动了。　　　叶迈
