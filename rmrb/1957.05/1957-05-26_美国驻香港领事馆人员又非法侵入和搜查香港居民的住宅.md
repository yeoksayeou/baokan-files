Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, May 25th: The Hong Kong "Wen Wei Po" reported today that personnel from the U.S. Consulate in Hong Kong have recently violated human rights again by illegally invading and searching the homes of Hong Kong residents.

On May 13th, the U.S. Consulate in Hong Kong sent an investigator and a translator to break into No. 5, Luli Street, Causeway Bay, Hong Kong, and illegally searched the home of Wu Shuzhi, a Hong Kong businessman. This businessman has lived in Hong Kong for decades and is an honorary advisor to a Hong Kong organization.

According to Wu Shuzhi's family, after the two U.S. Consulate personnel entered Wu Shuzhi's home that day, they interrogated everyone extensively, and then searched the house, including Wu Shuzhi's suitcases and cabinets, and finally prepared to take away some of Wu Shuzhi's documents. The interrogation and search lasted for three hours.

Wu Shuzhi then called the Hong Kong British Police Station to report the illegal search by the U.S. Consulate. The Hong Kong British police authorities sent people to question the two U.S. Consulate personnel.

The "Wen Wei Po" reporter inquired about this incident with the Commissioner of Police of Hong Kong, who confirmed that the police had indeed received a report of the aforementioned incident and learned that the Hong Kong British police authorities were investigating and handling the matter.

The newspaper reported that many residences and business firms in Hong Kong have been harassed by U.S. Consulate personnel illegally entering houses to search and forcibly inspect accounts. In January of last year, U.S. Consulate personnel forcibly entered South China Middle School in Hong Kong, interrogated and searched a female student named Lin Kangyi, and followed the female student for many days. The female student's parents later lodged a strong protest with the U.S. Consulate in Hong Kong.

    美国驻香港领事馆人员又非法侵入和搜查香港居民的住宅
    新华社香港25日电　香港“文汇报”今天报道，美国驻香港领事馆人员最近又侵犯人权，非法侵入和搜查香港居民的住宅。
    5月13日，美国驻香港领事馆派了一个调查员和一个翻译，闯入香港铜锣湾琉璃街五号，非法搜查香港商人伍述之的住宅。这个商人已经在香港居住了几十年，是香港一个社团的名誉顾问。
    据伍述之的家人说，当日这两个美国领事馆人员进入伍述之的住宅以后，就对各人进行多方盘问，接着又在屋内进行搜查，搜查范围包括伍述之的皮箧和箱柜，最后并准备将伍述之的一些文件带走。这次盘问和搜查时间长达三小时之久。
    伍述之随后即将美国领事馆的非法搜查事打电话给香港英国警署。香港英国警察当局派人将这两个美国领事馆人员带去问话。
      “文汇报”记者曾就这一事件向香港英国警务处长提出询问，证实警方确实接获上述事件的报告，并获悉香港英国警察当局正在对这件事进行调查和处理。
    报纸报道说，香港许多住宅和商行都曾经受过美国领事馆人员非法入屋搜查和强迫检查账目的骚扰。去年1月间，美国领事馆人员就曾经强入香港南华中学，盘问和搜查一个叫林康怡的女学生，并且连续跟踪这个女学生多天，这个女学生的家长事后曾向美国驻香港领事馆提出强硬抗议。
