Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 6th: The leading cadres of the state-owned Tianjin Dagu Chemical Plant put down their airs and went to the workshops to understand the workers' difficulties and demands, and to help the workers solve problems. This re-stimulated the enthusiasm of the workers who had been suppressed for a long time, and the production outlook was completely renewed.

The factory's main product, "666" pesticide, accounts for 70% of the factory's output value, but the "666" workshop is the weakest link in the factory. After studying the "Eighth National Congress" documents in February of this year, the factory's leading cadres resolved to change their leadership style. Li Fuyuan, the secretary of the Party general branch, Yan Fuying, the deputy director of the factory, and Zhu Huimin, the chairman of the trade union, put on their work clothes and went into the workshop to personally experience the actual situation and find out where the problems lay. When they first arrived at the workshop, they saw that the workshop was filled with toxic chlorine and hydrochloric acid fumes, and the workers were all wearing gas masks to work. The workers were very uncomfortable working in this environment. They compared it to this: when entering the factory, they had ten portions of energy, but after arriving at the workshop, only five portions were left, and after wearing a mask, they had not even one portion of energy. Therefore, many workers looked forward to getting off work as soon as they started their shifts. Although the workers had raised many opinions about this situation in the past, the leadership had always emphasized that the equipment was not good and did not actively try to solve the problem. The workers were very dissatisfied when they saw that the opinions they had raised were ignored by the leadership. Many workers were unwilling to raise any more opinions, only complaining behind their backs; some people held the attitude of working eight hours, finishing and leaving, and not meddling in other people's business. After these leading cadres discovered the above situation while getting along with the workers, they sincerely examined their bureaucratic work style of not caring about the workers' hardships; the workers also examined their shortcomings of simply blaming the leadership, not caring about production, and not cherishing state property. After finding out the reasons, the three leading cadres took turns working day and night shifts in the workshop, participated in the workers' production meetings, and worked with the workers to study and solve problems such as production equipment and labor conditions. Li Fuyuan, the secretary of the general branch, first proposed the slogan "Take off the masks and work happily," which motivated all the workers to spend only one day plugging all the air leaks in the workshop. Subsequently, the leadership took four more measures and proposed thirteen topics, mobilizing the workers to grab topics and find key points, and many problems that had not been solved in the past were solved in a timely manner.

The spirit of these leading cadres in going deep into the masses deeply moved the workers. The workers' once suppressed enthusiasm reappeared, and their labor enthusiasm was unprecedentedly high. Some workers who used to work with the attitude of coming to work and leaving work have now become advanced producers in the workshop. Since February, this workshop has overfulfilled its production plan for three consecutive months, and the consumption of the main raw material benzene has decreased month by month. In January, each ton of "666" powder required 354 kilograms of benzene, and in April it dropped to 307 kilograms; liquid chlorine dropped from 760 kilograms to 744 kilograms.

### 下车间才知工人疾苦

    下车间才知工人疾苦
    据新华社天津6日电　国营天津大沽化工厂的领导干部放下架子，到车间去体会工人的困难和要求，帮助工人解决问题，使工人长期被抑压的积极性重新激发起来，生产面貌为之一新。
    这个厂的主要产品“六六六”农药占全厂产值70％，但“六六六”车间是全厂最薄弱的环节。今年2月份，工厂领导干部学习了“八大”文件以后，决心改变领导作风。党总支书记李复元、副厂长严福英和工会主席朱惠民三人穿起工作服走进车间，亲身体会实际情况，寻找问题所在。他们刚到车间的时候，就看到车间到处弥漫着有毒性的氯气和盐酸味，工人都戴着防毒面具干活。工人在这种环境下工作很不舒服。他们比喻：进了厂有十分劲，到车间剩下五分，戴上面具连一分劲也没有了。因此，许多工人上了班就盼下班。这种情况虽然过去工人曾经提过不少意见，但是领导上一直强调设备不好，不积极设法加以解决。工人们看到自己所提的意见领导上置之不理，很不满意。很多工人不愿意再提意见，只在背地里发牢骚；有的人抱着上班八小时，干完就走，少管闲事的态度。当这些领导干部在和工人相处中发现了上述情况以后，就诚恳地向工人检查了不关心工人疾苦的官僚主义作风；工人也检查了单纯埋怨领导、不关心生产、不爱惜国家财产的缺点。找出原因以后，三个领导干部又分工昼夜在车间值班，参加工人的生产会议，和工人一起研究解决生产设备和劳动条件等问题。总支书记李复元首先提出“摘掉面具、愉快工作”的口号，带动了全体工人只用一天的时间就把车间里漏气冒气的漏洞都堵塞了。随后领导上又采取了四项措施，提出十三个课题，发动工人抢课题找关键，很多过去没有解决的问题都及时得到了解决。
    领导干部这种深入群众的精神，深深地感动了工人们。工人们一度被压抑的积极性又重新出现了，劳动热情空前高涨。有些过去抱着上班来、下班走的态度工作的工人，现在已经成了车间的先进生产者。从2月份以来，这个车间连续三个月都超额完成了产量计划，主要原料苯的消耗逐月下降，1月份每吨“六六六”粉需苯三百五十四公斤，4月份降到三百○七公斤多；液氯从七百六十公斤降到七百四十四公斤多。
