British Forced to Announce Use of Suez Canal
Israel and France Conspire to Dispatch Ships to Provoke in the Canal

(Comprehensive report from this newspaper) According to Western news agencies: British Prime Minister Macmillan announced in the House of Commons on the 13th that "British ships can now pass through the canal. Canal tolls and other fees will be paid in pounds."

Macmillan also revealed that negotiations would soon be held in "a neutral city" on the issue of the more than 100 million pounds of Egyptian funds frozen by Britain. However, he added that lifting or relaxing the various restrictions on these funds would "depend on a satisfactory arrangement to resolve all financial claims against Egypt." People believe that Macmillan's words are an implication that Britain will extort compensation for its properties in Egypt.

Macmillan's announcement caused shock among Conservative MPs. Eight prominent Conservative MPs, including Sir Victor Raikes and Viscount Hinchingbrooke, have decided to withdraw from the parliamentary party in protest against "surrender to Nasser."

British shipowners welcomed the decision to resume use of the canal. The chairman of the Shipping Federation, Simon, said that the government had made satisfactory arrangements for paying canal tolls.

On the same evening, a spokesman for the Egyptian Ministry of Finance and Economy announced that the British government had, from the 13th, lifted all restrictions on Egypt's future transactions with other countries in pounds sterling.

The official spokesman announced that British and Egyptian representatives had held talks in Switzerland last week to discuss the settlement of tolls paid by British ships using the canal and certain issues relating to Egypt's sterling balances.

The spokesman said that with the consent of the Egyptian Exchange Control Authority, canal tolls paid by British and other countries' ships could be deposited in a new pound sterling account.

The spokesman said that the British government had agreed that it would not infringe on Egypt's freedom to use this account, regardless of the circumstances. At the same time, the British government also promised to unfreeze from Egypt's frozen sterling funds the amount required to repay transactions made by Egypt in pounds sterling before Britain froze these funds on July 27, 1956.

The U.S. State Department declined to comment on Britain's decision. A statement issued by the State Department on the 13th said that it did not object to U.S. shipowners paying tolls to Egypt and using the canal "under protest." The statement reiterated the U.S. policy on the canal as stated on April 26: "Egypt's declaration does not fully comply with the six requirements of the Security Council; a final judgment on the management system proposed by Egypt cannot be made until it has been tried; the question of whether canal users can establish confidence depends on the actual implementation of Egypt's declaration." The State Department spokesman also said that the United States would continue to freeze Egyptian funds "just in case."

Commenting on the resumption of the use of the Suez Canal by Britain and some other shipping countries, a spokesman for the Israeli Foreign Ministry said that Israel would, at "the appropriate time," dispatch ships to attempt to pass through the canal "without restriction." If Israeli ships are prevented from passing through the Suez Canal, Israel will consider this an "act of war." He also said that Israel and France are in "close consultation" on the trial voyage issue.

At present, the French authorities still maintain their original attitude of not using the canal. French shipping companies need to rely on the government to obtain foreign exchange for paying canal tolls, and therefore have to comply with the government's instructions.

### 强权终于向正义低头  英国被迫宣布使用苏伊士运河  以法两国共谋派遣船只闯进运河挑衅

    强权终于向正义低头
    英国被迫宣布使用苏伊士运河
    以法两国共谋派遣船只闯进运河挑衅
    本报综合报道　据西方通讯社消息：英国首相麦克米伦13日在下院宣布，“英国船只现在可以通过运河。运河通行费和其他费用将用英镑支付”。
    麦克米伦并且透露，不久将在“一个中立的城市”就英国所冻结的一亿多镑埃及款项问题进行谈判。但是，他又说，要撤消或者放宽这笔款项的各种限制，必须“取决于解决对埃及的一切财政要求的圆满安排”。人们认为麦克米伦的这些话是暗示英国将勒索它在埃及的财产的赔偿。
    麦克米伦的宣布在保守党议员中引起震动。八个著名的保守党议员，其中包括维克托、瑞克斯爵士和欣琴布鲁克子爵，已经决定退出议会党团，以抗议“向纳赛尔投降”。
    英国船主欢迎恢复使用运河的决定，海运协会主席西蒙说，政府做出了令人满意的支付运河通行费的安排。
    同一天晚上，埃及财政经济部发言人宣布，英国政府从13日起取消了对埃及将来用英镑同其它国家进行交易的所有限制。
    这位官方发言人宣布，英国和埃及代表上星期曾经在瑞士进行会谈，讨论了关于使用运河的英国船只所交付的通行费的结账问题和埃及英镑结余的某些问题。
    发言人说，在得到埃及汇业管制局的同意之后，英国和其它国家的船只交付的运河通行费都可以存入一个新的英镑账户中。
    这位发言人说，英国政府已经同意，它将不侵犯埃及使用这个账户的自由，不管情况如何。同时，英国政府还答应从埃及的被冻结的英镑款项中，把埃及在英国1956年7月27日冻结这批款项以前用英镑进行的交易所必需偿付的数目解冻。
    美国国务院拒绝评论英国的决定。国务院13日发表的一项声明说，不反对美国船主在“提出抗议的情况下”向埃及交纳通行费和使用运河。声明重申了4月26日美国表明的对运河的政策：即“埃及的声明不完全符合安全理事会的六项要求；对埃及所提出的管理制度在试行以前还不能作出最后的判断；运河使用国是否能树立信心的问题要以埃及的声明实际实行的情况而定。”国务院的发言人还说：美国将继续冻结埃及的资金，“以防万一”。
    以色列外交部发言人在评论英国和其他一些海运国家恢复使用苏伊士运河时表示，以色列将在“适当的时候”派遣船只尝试“不受拘束地”通过运河。如果以色列船只被阻止通过苏伊士运河，以色列将认为这是“战争行动”。他又说，以色列同法国正在就试航问题作 “密切的磋商”。
    目前，法国当局仍保持原有的不通过运河的态度。法国轮船公司需要依靠政府来取得交付通过运河费用的外汇，因而不得不遵从政府的指示。
