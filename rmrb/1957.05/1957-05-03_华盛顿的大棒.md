    Washington's Big Stick
    Recently, the U.S. government suddenly became interested in holding military exercises in the Panama Canal Zone! According to Agence France-Presse, from April 25th, the United States concentrated 15,000 army and marine corps personnel, dispatched 200 aircraft and 34 warships in this small area, and held "the largest ever" military exercise in the region, lasting three days. Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, Radford, also personally attended the exercise.
    Why did the U.S. government make such a show of force and hold military exercises in the Panama Canal Zone? According to the Americans themselves, the purpose was "to demonstrate in an indisputable way" that the United States would never let the Panama Canal fall into the hands of the "enemy"!
    The Panama Canal has always been under the occupation of the U.S. military, and the U.S. government also admits that there is currently no indication that the canal's navigation is threatened. So, who is the "enemy" being referred to? And to whom is the U.S. military power "demonstrating"?
    An Agence France-Presse dispatch from Washington provides some clues. According to this news agency, the U.S. government hopes that this exercise will cause the Panamanian government to adopt a more "realistic" attitude towards the Canal Zone. So that's the reason. Indeed, since Egypt nationalized the Suez Canal Company and imperialist intervention repeatedly failed, Panamanian public opinion has been clamoring for Panama to also take action and recover the canal area from the United States, which has occupied the Panama Canal for many years. Recently, Panamanian President de la Guardia has also repeatedly declared Panama's sovereignty over the canal. This has obviously angered those in Washington who have inherited the tradition of old Roosevelt. They decided to wield the "big stick." Washington's strategists even came up with the idea of "inviting" the Panamanian president to attend and observe this demonstrative exercise. This is truly vicious.
    It seems that the logic of these strategists is that Panama is weaker than Egypt, and the United States is stronger than Britain and France. As long as a little pressure is applied, wouldn't tiny Panama be as silent as a cicada in winter? Is the reality really so satisfactory? Not necessarily. According to the British "Daily Express," "anti-American sentiment in Panama has developed to a dangerous level." Although Panama is small, can we imagine that its people will forever tolerate a foreign country cutting their country in half, occupying their territory, and taking Panama's canal as its own? Moreover, the Panamanian people's struggle to defend their sovereignty over the canal is not isolated. Recently, legal experts from various Latin American countries jointly issued a statement, supporting the demands of the Panamanian people from a legal point of view. The authority of their statement should at least make that lawyer who started his career at Cromwell &事务所, have to rack his brains even more when defending the "legitimacy" of the United States' permanent occupation of the Panama Canal Zone. What is really important is that this struggle has only just begun.

    华盛顿的大棒
    最近，美国政府忽然对在巴拿马运河区举行军事演习发生兴趣了！据法新社报道，从4月25日起，美国在这块弹丸之地，集中了一万五千名陆军和海军陆战队，出动了二百架飞机和三十四艘军舰，在这个地区举行了“有史以来规模最大的一次”军事演习，演习历时三天。美国参谋长联席会议主席雷德福还亲自到场观看演习。
    美国政府为什么要兴师动众，在巴拿马运河区举行军事演习呢？根据美国人自己的说法，目的“在于以无庸争论的方式表现出”，美国决不让巴拿马运河落到“敌人”的手里！
    巴拿马运河始终在美国军队占领下，美国政府也承认，目前并没有任何迹象足以表明这条运河通航受到威胁，那么，所指的“敌人”是谁？美国的军事力量又是“表现”给谁看的呢？
    法新社的一条华盛顿电讯给人提供了一些线索。据这家通讯社说，美国政府希望通过这次演习，会使巴拿马政府对运河区采取更多的“现实主义”态度。原来如此。的确，自从埃及将苏伊士运河公司收归国有而帝国主义的干涉一再失败之后，巴拿马公众舆论纷纷要求巴拿马也采取行动，从强占了巴拿马运河多年的美国手中，收回运河地区。最近巴拿马总统德拉古阿迪亚也屡次声明巴拿马对运河的主权。这显然触恼了华盛顿那些继承了老罗斯福传统的人们。他们就决定要挥舞一下“大棒”。华盛顿的战略家们甚至还想得出来，把巴拿马总统“邀请”到场，参观这场示威性演习。这也真够穷凶极恶了。
    看来，这些战略家的逻辑是，巴拿马比埃及还要弱小，美国比英法则来得强大，只要略施颜色，小小的巴拿马岂有不噤若寒蝉之理。事实果真这样如意么？未必。据英国“每日快报”报道，在巴拿马“反美情绪已经发展到危险程度”。巴拿马虽小，我们能够设想它的人民会永远容忍一个外国把他们国家拦腰截断，霸占他们的领土，据巴拿马的运河为己有吗？何况，巴拿马人民维护运河主权的斗争并不孤立。最近拉丁美洲各国法律专家共同发表声明，从法律观点支持了巴拿马人民的要求。他们的声明的权威性，至少也要使得那位从克伦威尔事务所起家的讼师，在为美国永久据有巴拿马运河地区的“合法性”辩护时，得更为挖空心思。真正重要的是：这一场斗争只不过刚开始。
