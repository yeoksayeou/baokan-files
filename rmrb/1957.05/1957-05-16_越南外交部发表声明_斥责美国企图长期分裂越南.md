Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 15th: The spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement saying that the joint communique signed by Eisenhower and Ngo Dinh Diem in Washington on May 11th "once again proves the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism and the Southern regime to permanently divide Vietnam, turn South Vietnam into a U.S. military base, and prepare to provoke a new war."

The statement, prominently published in Hanoi newspapers today, pointed out that in order to conceal this conspiracy and divert public opinion, the United States and Ngo Dinh Diem, in the joint communique, instead slandered North Vietnam for increasing its military strength.

The statement believes that the so-called argument in the joint communique that South Vietnam must deal with subversive activities is nothing more than an excuse to cover up the fascist policies of terror they are implementing against former resistance personnel, against patriots who advocate peace and unification, and who support the Geneva Accords.

The statement said, "In order to deceive public opinion and alleviate the anger of the Vietnamese people, the joint communique was forced to talk about the issue of unifying Vietnam by peaceful means."

The Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs emphasized in the statement that the conspiracies and actions of the United States and Ngo Dinh Diem violate the Geneva Accords and the United Nations Charter, violate the Vietnamese people's desire for peaceful unification, and threaten the cause of consolidating peace in Southeast Asia and the world.

The statement reiterated the need to ensure that the Geneva Accords are respected and strictly implemented in order to consolidate peace and realize the unification of Vietnam.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 15th: According to the Vietnam News Agency: Major General Phan Trong Tue, Chief Representative of the Delegation of the High Command of the Vietnam People's Army to the Vietnam Central Joint Ceasefire Committee, wrote to Ambassador Cowl, Chairman of the International Commission for Vietnam, on May 10th, requesting the South Vietnamese authorities to respect and implement the Geneva Accords, especially the provisions of Article 14(c), to cease acts of terror and retaliation, and to guarantee democratic freedoms to individuals or groups who participated in the resistance war and advocate peaceful reunification.

Major General Phan Trong Tue pointed out that the South Vietnamese authorities are now conspiring to abolish the legal effect of Article 14(c) of the Geneva Accords, which stipulates the prohibition of persecution of former resistance personnel, in order to freely continue suppressing, terrorizing, and retaliating against former resistance personnel. Major General Phan Trong Tue requested that the views of the Vietnam People's Army be reported to the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference.

    越南外交部发表声明
    斥责美国企图长期分裂越南
    新华社河内15日电　越南民主共和国外交部发言人发表声明说，艾森豪威尔和吴庭艳5月11日在华盛顿签订的联合公报“再一次证明美帝国主义和南方政权企图长期分裂越南，变越南南方为美国军事基地，准备挑起新战争的阴谋”。
    河内报纸今天显著刊登的这个声明指出，为了掩饰这种阴谋和转移舆论的视线，美国和吴庭艳在联合公报中反而诬蔑越南北方在增加军事力量。
    声明认为，联合公报中的所谓越南南方必须对付颠复活动的论调，只不过是为了掩盖他们对前抗战人员，对赞成和平和统一，赞成日内瓦协议的爱国者所实行的法西斯恐怖政策的借口而已。
    声明说，“为了要欺骗舆论，缓和越南人民的愤怒，所以联合公报被迫谈到以和平的方法来统一越南问题”。
    越南外交部在声明中强调，美国和吴庭艳的阴谋和行动，违反日内瓦协议和联合国宪章，违反越南人民和平统一的愿望，威胁东南亚和世界人民巩固和平的事业。
    声明重申必须使日内瓦协议得到尊重和严正实施，以巩固和平和实现越南的统一。
    新华社河内15日电　据越南通讯社讯：越南中央联合停战委员会越南人民军总司令部代表团首席代表潘重慧少将5月10日写信给越南国际委员会主席高尔大使，要求南越当局尊重和执行日内瓦协定，特别是第十四条丙款的规定，停止恐怖和报复的行动。保证参加抗战和赞成和平统一的个人或团体的民主自由。
    潘重慧少将指出，南越当局现在正在阴谋取消规定禁止迫害前抗战人员的日内瓦协定第十四条丙款的法律作用，以便放手继续对前抗战人员进行镇压和恐怖的活动和报复。潘重慧少将要求把越南人民军的意见报告给日内瓦会议两位主席。
