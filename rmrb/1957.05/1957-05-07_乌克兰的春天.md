Ukraine's Spring
By the Editorial Board of "Soviet Ukraine Newspaper," Fulangchuk

Spring. The birch trees awaken from their winter sleep, their branches filled with fresh and sweet sap. Since ancient times, birch sap has been a beloved drink of the residents of the lush forests of Ukraine. In the spring, one can see hundreds of containers hanging on the trees in the birch forests, with the cool liquid flowing into these containers through specially made tubes.

"The earth is breathing."

The period of collecting birch sap has always coincided with the start of spring fieldwork. In the spring sunshine, the land rises with a hazy blue smoke, evaporating moisture. "The earth is breathing," experienced collective farmers say, and they hurry to the fields. Every minute is precious at this time. Missing the opportunity to harrow the autumn-plowed land will result in the loss of valuable moisture, forcing them to sow seeds in dry soil.

Ukraine is a republic with significant differences in natural conditions and climate. Its southernmost region is the Crimean Peninsula, where even many subtropical plants can grow well. A little further north, along the Black Sea coast, stretches the vast southern Ukrainian steppe, the main base for producing wheat, corn, sunflowers, vegetables, southern hemp, and other crops. Further north is the forest-steppe zone, a region for growing sugar beets. The Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic accounts for 75% of the total sugar beet production in the Soviet Union. Further north, all the way to the borders of Poland and Belarus, lies the vast forest zone of Ukraine. Here, flax, potatoes, fodder lupine, vegetables, and other crops grow very well. The western regions, located on the southeastern slopes of the Carpathian Mountains, have a temperate climate with abundant rainfall throughout the year. Agriculture here is intensive, with sugar beets and spring-sown crops dominating the crop rotation system of the collective farms, while autumn-sown crops have lower yields. This frontier region has abundant orchards. Every year, several thousand carloads of fresh and dried fruits are shipped from here to all parts of the country.

The republic's geographical environment determines the diversity of its agricultural production. In this respect, Soviet Ukraine is somewhat similar to China. Although the farmers of Podolia have never seen hills, they, like the farmers of Northeast China, successfully grow tomatoes, cucumbers, corn, cabbage, raise pigs, chickens and ducks. Incidentally, the famous Peking duck is also very popular in our country.

Last year, Ukraine did not have much snow, and the weather was not very cold. The snow that fell quickly melted, and the soil did not absorb enough moisture. In the southern regions, when it warmed up in early February, the snow disappeared completely. The soil began to dry out rapidly. Collective farms and state farms in Odessa, Kherson, Crimea, and other southern regions had already begun fieldwork in the second half of February. For Crimea, this was more or less normal, but for the steppe regions, it was somewhat too early. However, there was no time to consider. Experienced agronomists, citing data from many years, concluded that there was no danger in sowing early in February. Crops such as oats, barley, and sunflowers can be sown in February, and they can withstand even temporary cold spells. Thus, southern Ukraine began sowing early spring crops in February.

Tractor drivers await the signal.

In the spring season, one cannot help but recall scenes of preparing for battle. In the tractor team's field camps, the sowing units are "on standby." Heavy tractors have undergone many careful inspections, and various implements – cultivators, seeders, harrows, plows – are ready. Tractors are filled with fuel, and seeders are filled with seeds. Tractor drivers and seeder operators are waiting for the signal.

Imagine this scene. A person on a bicycle or horseback rides along the dusty roads of spring towards the machinery operators' quarters. Everyone in the quarters, who has been living in a state of readiness these days, runs from the rooms to the yard, impatiently waiting. The person who arrived informs them which field is ready to be cultivated. Everyone immediately takes action. Agronomists, field team leaders, and machinery team leaders mobilize the sowing units according to a pre-arranged plan. The tractors begin to roar, the implements clatter, and the sowing units move to the fields. The other units stay behind to wait for their shifts. But at this time, the waiting time is not calculated in days and nights, but in hours. By the next morning, the tractor team's quarters will be left only with the statistician, the cook, and the fuel truck. The rest come here only to sleep for a few hours.

From the start of spring work, the tractors work day and night. During the day, they sow seeds, and at night, they prepare the land for sowing, which is to harrow the autumn-plowed land and carry out spring plowing. Collective farms in Crimea began sowing early crops on February 16 and completed all the work by February 19. The tractors freed from sowing were all transferred to plow fallow land.

Since industry has provided the countryside with powerful agricultural technical equipment, spring sowing of early crops is no longer a complex problem for the collective farms and state farms of Ukraine. This work is usually completed in three or four days. But spring also brings many other complex and troublesome problems, and the success of the year depends on correctly solving these problems.

Last year's dry autumn and erratic winter were unfavorable for the growth of autumn-sown crops. And Ukraine is the most important base for the production of winter wheat in the Soviet Union. True, Ukraine now has a strong competitor – the virgin lands. Last year, the virgin lands of Kazakhstan alone gave the state ten billion poods of wheat, which is amazing! All Soviet people are very happy about this. The collective farmers and machinery operators of Ukraine are also rejoicing at this achievement. But they are very clear that Ukrainian wheat is not superfluous for the motherland's granary, and they have pledged that this year's wheat yield will be no less than one hundred poods per hectare.

The struggle for a bumper wheat harvest not only began in the autumn, but this struggle continues throughout the winter, especially in the spring. As early as February, thousands of agricultural airplanes appeared over the wheat fields. They spread mineral fertilizers on the unfrozen soil.

Corn is a promising crop.

In Ukraine, corn ranks second only to wheat as a grain crop. Although corn has been grown in Ukraine for a long time, the workers of the republic have only been convinced that it is a promising crop in the last two or three years. In the past, the area sown with corn was small, and it was a secondary crop. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union later pointed out that it was wrong to treat corn in this way. Comrade Khrushchev himself came to Ukraine several times. Comrade Khrushchev led the republic's party organization here many years ago. He is very familiar with our famous corn growers, who harvest 500 to 600 poods of corn grain and 1,200 to 1,500 poods of green stalks per hectare each year. Comrade Khrushchev finally convinced the comrades in Ukraine of the benefits of corn. In two years, the area sown with corn has increased almost nine times. This year, the republic will sow 5.7 million hectares of corn.

Now there is no need to publicize the benefits of growing corn. The following indicators have already done this job well: in 1954 (the year when corn began large-scale production), the annual milk yield per cow in the republic was 1,218 kilograms; the following year, it increased by 217 kilograms, and in 1956, when corn had become the main feed, it increased by another 749 kilograms. In two years, the republic's milk production has increased by more than half, and this year it will double.

Increasing crop yields, that is our virgin land, is the most important potential for the further upsurge of the republic's agriculture.

A gift to the October Revolution.

This spring in Ukraine is very different from previous years. This is a spring commemorating the 40th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution. To celebrate the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, a socialist competition has been launched throughout the country. The agricultural workers of Ukraine are fighting to increase the yields of various crops, to double meat production, and to increase milk production by one and a half times. Each collective farm, state farm, and agricultural machinery station has formulated specific plans. The main focus of these plans is to utilize the existing potential. There is a great deal of this potential. We believe that corn is one of them. By adopting one measure, namely sowing hybrid seeds, the yield will increase by 25%-30%. This year, a specially cultivated hybrid corn seed will be sown in the entire area. For this purpose, the republic has established thousands of specialized breeding farms for improving seeds last year. Recently, the entire corn soil will be planted with this hybrid seed. Ukraine is becoming the base for the production of hybrid seeds nationwide.

Our collective farmers often say: "We need more, better, and more economical products." The 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union put forward important tasks for rural workers: to double agricultural labor productivity by the end of the Sixth Five-Year Plan. This means that each unit of labor must produce twice as much as we produce now.

The spring of 1957 is a promising spring for the workers of Soviet Ukraine. The workers of Ukraine are successfully implementing the grand Sixth Five-Year Plan, and are making great contributions to strengthening the economic strength of their motherland, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and to consolidating the cause of world peace.

    乌克兰的春天
    “苏维埃乌克兰报”编委　弗朗楚克
    春天，白桦树从冬眠中苏醒过来，枝干满藏着清新而香甜的液汁。自古以来白桦树汁就是林木茂盛的乌克兰的居民热爱的饮料。在春天，可以在白桦树林里看到几百个挂在树上的容器，清凉的液汁经过特制的管子流注到这些容器里。
    “土地呼吸了”
    采集白桦树汁的时期一向也正是在春季田间工作开始的时候。土地在春天的阳光下升起蒸发着水气的灰蓝色烟雾。“土地呼吸了”，有经验的集体农民都这样说，并且赶紧下地。这时候每一分钟都是宝贵的。错过耙松秋耕地的时机，就会失掉十分宝贵的水分，也就不得不把种子撒在干燥的土壤里。
    乌克兰是一个自然条件和气候差异很大的共和国。它的最南部地区是克里米亚半岛。这里连许多亚热带的植物都能很适宜地生长。稍微往北一点，沿着黑海海岸伸展着广阔的乌克兰南部草原，这是生产小麦、玉蜀黍、向日葵、蔬菜、南方大麻以及其他作物的主要基地。再往北，是森林草原地带，种植甜菜的地区。乌克兰苏维埃社会主义共和国的甜菜产量占全苏联产量的75％。再往北直到波兰和白俄罗斯的边界，那是乌克兰森林地带一望无际的大森林。这里亚麻、马铃薯、饲料羽扇豆、蔬菜等作物都生长得很好。西部各州位于喀尔巴阡山的东南麓，气候温和，全年雨量丰富。这里的农业是精耕细作的，甜菜和春种作物在集体农庄轮种制中占优势，而秋种作物产量不高。这个边疆区有丰盛的果园。每年从这里向全国各地运出好几千车皮鲜果和干果。
    共和国的这种地理环境决定着它的农业生产的多样性。苏维埃乌克兰在这方面有点像中国。波多利耶的农民虽然从来没有见过山岗，但是他们也和中国东北的农民一样成功地栽种西红柿、黄瓜、玉蜀黍、白菜，饲养猪和鸡、鸭。这里顺便提一下，著名的北京鸭在我们国内也很时兴。
    去年乌克兰下雪不多，天气不太寒冷。降下的雪很快就融化了，土壤没有吸收到充足的水分。在南部地区，当2月初暖的时候，雪就完全消失了。土壤开始迅速地干化。敖德萨、赫尔松、克里米亚和其他南部各州的集体农庄和国营农场，还在2月下半月就已经开始田间工作了。对于克里米亚，这或多或少还是正常的现象，对于草原各州就有些为时过早了。但是，考虑的时间是没有的。有经验的农艺师们引证了好多年的资料，得出结论：在2月提前播种并没有危险。像燕麦、大麦、向日葵这样一些作物可以在2月播种，即使天气暂时转寒，它们也经受得起。这样，乌克兰南方在2月里就已开始播种早春作物。
    拖拉机手等待着信号
    在春天这个季节里，不能不令人回想起准备战斗动作的情景。在拖拉机队的野营里，播种机组正在“待命出动”。重型拖拉机业已经过许多次仔细的检查，各种联挂农具——耘土机、播种机、耙、犁也都准备停当。拖拉机都灌满了油，播种机装满了种子。拖拉机手和播种机手正在等候信号。
    请想像一下这样的图景。一位骑自行车的或骑马的人沿着春天的尘土飞扬的道路向机械操使者营舍驰去。营舍里所有的人在这些天内都是过着行军状态的生活，这时从房间里跑到院子中，急不可耐地等候着。跑来的人通知他们哪一块地已经可以开始耕作。所有的人立刻行动起来。农艺师、田间农作队长和机械队长，按早已编制好的计划，调动播种机组。拖拉机开始轰鸣，联挂农具轧轧作响，于是播种机组开到地里去了。其他的机组留下等候轮班工作。但是这时候等待的时间已经不是按昼夜而是按小时来计算了。赶到次日清晨，拖拉机队营舍里就将仅仅剩下统计员、女厨师和运油车，其余的人上这里来不过是为了睡几个小时的觉而已。
    从春季工作开始起，拖拉机就昼夜不停地进行工作。白天它们播种，夜间准备播种的地，也就是耙松秋耕地，进行春耕。克里米亚的集体农庄在2月16日开始播种早期作物，2月19日就全部完成。从播种工作中解脱出来的拖拉机被全部调去翻耕休耕地。
    自从工业给农村提供了强大的农业技术设备以来，早期作物的春播工作对于乌克兰的集体农庄和国营农场就不再是一个复杂的问题了。这项工作照例是在三、四天内就完成了。但是春天也带来了其他许多复杂的劳神的问题，一年的成就还有赖于正确地解决这些问题。
    去年的干旱的秋季和变化无常的冬季，对于秋播作物的成长是不利的。而乌克兰是苏联的冬小麦生产的最重要的基地。诚然，乌克兰现在有了一个强大的对手——生荒地。去年光是哈萨克斯坦的生荒地就给了国家十亿普特小麦，真了不起啊！全苏联人都为这件事非常高兴。乌克兰的集体农民和机械操使者也都为这样的成就而欢欣鼓舞。但是他们非常清楚，乌克兰的小麦对于祖国的粮仓并不是多余的，他们已经提出保证，今年的小麦产量将不低于每公顷一百普特。
    争取小麦丰收的斗争，不仅在秋天就已开始，而且这一斗争在整个冬天，特别是在春天仍在继续着。还在2月份，数千架农业飞机就已出现在麦田的上空。它们在尚未解冻的土壤上撒下矿物肥料。
    玉蜀黍是有希望的作物
    在乌克兰玉蜀黍仅次于小麦，占粮食作物的第二位。乌克兰种植玉蜀黍虽已由来很久，但是共和国的劳动者确信它是大有希望的作物，无论如何还只是两三年前的事。从前玉蜀黍的播种面积不大，并且是次要作物。苏联共产党中央委员会后来指出了用这样的态度来对待玉蜀黍是错误的。赫鲁晓夫同志曾亲自来过乌克兰几次。赫鲁晓夫同志好多年前曾在这里领导共和国的党组织。他很熟悉我们著名的玉蜀黍种植能手，他们每公顷土地每年收获五百至六百普特玉蜀黍粒和一千二百至一千五百普特青茎。赫鲁晓夫同志终于使乌克兰的同志们信服了玉蜀黍的好处。两年来，玉蜀黍的播种面积几乎增加了九倍。在今年，共和国将播种玉蜀黍五百七十万公顷。
    现在已经无须再宣传种植玉蜀黍的好处了。下列一些指标已经很好地完成了这个任务：1954年（玉蜀黍开始大规模生产的一年）共和国每头母牛每年挤奶量为一千二百一十八公斤；第二年增加了二百一十七公斤，而在1956年，当时玉蜀黍已成为主要的饲料，又增加了七百四十九公斤。两年来共和国牛奶的生产已提高了半倍多，而今年将会提高一倍。
    提高农作物产量，这就是我们的生荒地，是共和国农业进一步高涨的最重要的潜力。
    向十月革命节献礼
    今年春天在乌克兰和往年大不相同。这是一个纪念伟大十月社会主义革命四十周年的春天。为了庆祝十月革命四十周年，全国开展了社会主义竞赛。乌克兰的农业劳动者正在为提高各种作物的收获量、为肉类生产扩大一倍和牛奶生产增加一倍半而进行着斗争。每个集体农庄、国营农场、农业机器站都拟定了具体计划。这些计划中主要的是利用现有的潜力。这种潜力是非常之多的。我们觉得，像玉蜀黍就是其中之一。只要采用一种措施，即播种杂交种子，收获量就会提高25％—30％。今年在全部面积上将播种一种特别培育的玉蜀黍的杂交种子。为此还在去年共和国就建立了数以千计的专门改良种子的育种农场。最近，全部玉蜀黍的土壤上都将种植这种杂交种子。乌克兰正在变为全国杂交种子生产的基地。
    我们的集体农庄庄员们常常说：“我们需要又多、又好、又省的产品。”苏联共产党第二十次代表大会向乡村劳动者提出了重要的任务：到第六个五年计划结束时农业的劳动生产率将提高一倍。这就意味着，每个劳动单位的产品必须比我们现在所生产的多一倍。
    1957年的春天对于苏维埃乌克兰的劳动者来说，是一个大有前途的春天。乌克兰的劳动者正在顺利地实现着宏伟的第六个五年计划，正在对加强自己的祖国——苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟的经济实力，对巩固世界和平的事业作出巨大的贡献。
