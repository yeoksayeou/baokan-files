Speak From The Heart
Democratic figures and senior intellectuals in the Ministry of Forestry and the Meteorological Bureau criticize Party leaders

    This newspaper reports: On the 23rd, the Party Group of the Ministry of Forestry invited democratic figures within the ministry, as well as those who previously worked in the Ministry of Forestry and now work in the Ministry of Forest Industry, to a forum. Those attending the meeting included Huang Fanxiao, Cheng Chongde, Fu Yaomei, Chen Jusheng, Yi Weiqing, Tan Zhaoxiong, and Meng Xiaxiong, members of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang; Yuan Yisheng, Ji Renwei, Liu Hongqian, Zhong Shuwen, and Han Shoutang, members of the China Democratic League; Zhang Chubao, Li Yuhua, Tu Guanghan, Wang Yu, Du Pengling, Liu Jiasheng, and Lin Gang, members of the Jiusan Society; and non-party democratic figures Zhang Boying, Li Tongqi, Han Linfeng, Liu Junsan, Gao Xianbin, Yu Gancheng, and Huang Yang.
    Zhang Chubao believed that the Ministry of Forestry should focus on opposing sectarianism. He said: When the Ministry of Forestry was first established, the relationship between the Party and the masses was relatively good. As the work progressed, the number of Party members increased, the system became stricter, and it seemed that non-Party members were becoming less and less trusted. All those sent to the Soviet Union for internships by the Survey and Design Bureau were Party members and members of the Communist Youth League, but some of them were of very poor quality, and they didn't gain much after returning, wasting a lot of money. There were also differences in living standards. Non-Party section chiefs still lived in old dormitories in the city, while the families of Party division chiefs and section chiefs hadn't even arrived yet, but rooms were being reserved for them in the new dormitories. The situation was even worse for ordinary staff. Once, a regular cadre talked to the housing manager about housing problems, and immediately asked what level he was. When he replied that he was at level 20, the housing manager said: Come back in five years. He also pointed out that some senior cadres did not pay attention to united front work. When he was the Deputy Director of the Forestry Management Department, a Party Director scolded him fiercely at a meeting, saying: You have to look at official documents first, are you the Director? Are you a Communist Party member? He said: All these things made me feel negative.
    Huang Fanxiao said: The phenomenon of the Party substituting for the government exists in the Ministry of Forestry. In the past, major issues such as guidelines and policies were rarely discussed at administrative meetings. For example, eucalyptus trees are not a suitable species for afforestation on barren hills, but they were planted on a large scale in South China without research, and the results were not good. There are many trees that grow faster than it, so why plant it?
    Li Yuhua said: The leadership of the Ministry of Forestry is characterized by hard-working bureaucracy. They are busy, but the problems are not solved, and the guidelines are also wavering. There is a lot of logging, but very little replanting. Hundreds of management offices have been set up, but the conditions are not adequate. The average survival rate of afforestation is only 40% to 60%, resulting in great losses. Ji Renwei also believed that afforestation work lacked planning and only focused on afforestation on barren hills, neglecting replanting. If this continues, in a few decades, we will end up with nothing: barren hills with trees but no forests, and the expansion of logging in state-owned forest areas, creating large areas of wasteland. Therefore, we must overcome bureaucracy, listen to the opinions of the masses, and determine the work guidelines.
    Liu Jiasheng, Cheng Chongde, Han Linfeng, Li Tongqi, Du Pengling, and others also spoke at the meeting.
    Hui Zhongquan, Deputy Secretary of the Party Group of the Ministry of Forestry, concluded by saying: Everyone's opinions are very good, and I hope everyone will speak more enthusiastically at the next meeting.

    This newspaper reports: The Party Group of the Central Meteorological Bureau held forums for high and middle-level technical personnel from the bureau and its directly affiliated institutions in Beijing on May 10, 11, and 23. Those attending the meeting included Tu Changwang, Director of the Bureau, Lu Wu, Deputy Director, Ye Guixin, Deputy Principal of Beijing Meteorological School, and Gu Junxi, Zhu Hezhou, Feng Xiuzhao, Wang Pengfei, Wang Xianzhao, Qin Shanyuan, Zhang Hansong, Tan Ding, Zhai Yuzong, Kang Wenxu, Gao Guiting, Wu Jiepu, Zhang Zhiqi, and others. At the meeting, everyone frankly and sharply criticized the bureau's leadership and the sectarianism and bureaucratic work styles of certain Party members.
    Tu Changwang said: Many engineering and technical personnel have problems, especially ideological problems or opinions about the leadership. They are unwilling to talk to Party members, but are willing to talk to non-Party members, which shows that there is a gap between the Party and the masses. Wang Pengfei said: Sometimes I want to talk to Party members to solve my ideological problems, but after talking, not only are the problems not solved, but the Party members take it as briefing material. Often, talking will result in being labeled as having a problematic stance. Therefore, I usually treat Party members with respect, speak very cautiously, and act very carefully, for fear of being "selected" as a "target" in future movements. Zhu Hezhou said: When I was the Deputy Director of the Weather Department, every day when I went to and from work, a clerk would come up to me to look at my briefcase. This person was very stupid. Even if you are monitoring me, you have to be more subtle. I don't care about prestige, but how can I work with this kind of behavior? What does the clerk think I am? I think there are two situations: one, capturing and using me as a "prisoner," and two, treating me as a special agent. Work still has to be done. Tu Changwang said: The reason for this situation is that there is an incomplete understanding of engineering and technical personnel, an underestimation of their technical role, and a lack of trust. In particular, certain Party leaders often prefer to listen to the opinions of laymen rather than the opinions of technical personnel, which is very regrettable. They believe that this situation seriously affects the role of engineers and senior technical personnel.
    Feng Xiuzhao pointed out that the Meteorological Bureau placed too much emphasis on politics and neglected technology when selecting students and interns to study abroad. As a result, the quality of those sent was low, while people with considerable skills and practical work experience were not sent. This will not only affect the rapid improvement of future work, but also cost the country more money. Gu Junxi said: When sending working groups abroad, experts should have been selected, but "old" cadres who did not understand meteorology were sent. The same is true for promoting cadres. Zhu Hezhou mentioned that there are two observers with more than ten years of experience in the data group of the Shenyang Station, but they are led by a young girl who is only seventeen or eighteen years old because she is a member of the Communist Youth League. This is not based on work needs, but affects the work.
    Tan Ding said: There are two department directors in the Beijing Meteorological School who do not understand meteorology, but they occupy the position simply because they are Party members.
    During the forum, everyone put forward opinions on how to use the existing engineering strength. They believe that in the context of the rapid development of meteorological services and the shortage of technical personnel, how to correctly use engineering and technical personnel is worth studying.
    Wang Xianzhao pointed out: The biggest crisis facing technical personnel at present is that they are taking the road of "insiders becoming outsiders, and outsiders becoming ignoramuses." They are usually burdened with administrative affairs, working themselves into a daze, and have no time to read foreign magazines and books, let alone pay attention to the dynamics of domestic meteorological science. Over time, they forget everything they know, and no new knowledge comes in. This is because administrative cadres do not study or delve into things, but indulge in the "administrative leadership" method of signing and issuing documents. Wang Pengfei also pointed out that the direction of using technical cadres is not clear, and the personnel department often promotes technical cadres whom they think are good to administrative work, which is not right.

    把心里的话说出来
    林业部、气象局民主人士和高级知识分子对党员领导干部提出批评
    本报讯　23日，中共林业部党组邀请部内以及过去曾在林业部工作、现在在森林工业部工作的民主人士举行座谈会。出席这次会议的有民革成员黄范孝、程崇德、傅耀楣、陈举升、易维清、谭兆雄、孟夏雄；民盟成员袁易生、纪仁伟、刘鸿谦、锺舒文、韩寿堂；九三学社成员张楚宝、李毓华、涂光涵、汪愚、杜鹏凌、刘家声、林刚以及无党派民主人士张伯英、李桐琦、韩麟凤、刘俊三、高宪斌、于干城、黄扬等。
    张楚宝认为林业部应当着重反对宗派主义。他说：林业部初成立时，党群关系还较好。随着工作的进展，党员人数增多了，制度也严格了，对非党人员也好像越来越不信任了。调查设计局派去苏联实习的都是党员和团员，但有些人程度很差，回来后收获不大，浪费了很多钱。生活待遇上也有差别，非党科长还住在城里旧宿舍里，党员处长科长家属还没有来，就在新宿舍里留了房子。一般人员更差，有一次一位普通干部找管房的人谈住房问题，开口就问是哪一级，回答是二十级，管房人说：你过五年再来。他还指出某些较高级干部也不注意统战工作。在林业经营司时他是副司长，一位党员正司长在一次会议上声色俱厉地对他说：公文你要先看，你是正司长？你是共产党员吗？他说：这些都使我情绪消极。
    黄范孝说：林业部以党代政的现象是存在的，过去有关方针政策等重大问题很少在行政会议上讨论。例如桉树并不是荒山造林的树种，但没经研究便在华南大规模种植，结果不好。比它生长快的树很多，为什么要种它？
    李毓华说：林业部领导上是辛辛苦苦的官僚主义，忙来忙去问题没有解决，方针也摇摆不定。林木采伐的多，但迹地更新的很少。经营所一搞就是几百个，但条件不够。造林成活率平均只有40％到60％，损失很大。纪仁伟也认为造林工作计划性很差，只顾荒山造林，忽视迹地更新。像这样，几十年后，便会两头落空：荒山有树无林，国有林区采伐扩大，造成大面积荒地。因此，必须克服官僚主义，倾听群众意见，确定工作方针。
    在会上发言的还有刘家声、程崇德、韩麟凤、李桐琦、杜鹏凌等人。
    林业部党组副书记惠中权最后说：大家所提意见很好，希望大家在下次会议更加踊跃地发言。
    本报讯　中央气象局党组在5月10日、11日和23日分别召开了局及在京直属机构的高、中级技术人员座谈会。参加会议的有涂长望局长，卢鋈副局长，北京气象学校叶桂馨副校长和顾钧禧、朱和周、冯秀藻、王鹏飞、王宪钊、秦善元、张汉松、谭丁、翟裕宗、康文驌、高桂庭、吴介甫、张之琦等人。会上，大家坦率地、尖锐地批评了局的领导工作及某些党员同志的宗派主义和官僚主义的思想作风。
    涂长望说：工程技术人员有很多问题，特别是思想问题或对领导上的意见，不愿与党员谈，而愿与非党人员谈，这说明党与群众间是有一道鸿沟的。王鹏飞说：有时想找党员谈谈，解决自己的思想问题，但谈了以后，不仅问题没解决，反被党员拿去作汇报材料。往往一谈就会被扣上个立场有问题的帽子。因而平时遇到党员就恭恭敬敬，讲话很拘束，行动很谨慎，唯恐以后在运动中被“选”为“对象”。朱和周说：我在天气处当副处长时，每天上下班，总有一个科员到我面前看我的皮包，这个人很笨，你就是监视我，也得讲究些方法。我是不考虑威信的，但这种作法，如何叫我工作呢？科员还以为我是什么人？我想这样做有两个情况：一、抓住俘虏干事，二、把我当特务，工作还要做。涂长望说：产生这种情况的原因，是对工程技术人员了解不全面，对他们的技术作用估计不足，信任不够。特别对某些党员领导干部，往往喜欢听外行人的话，而不听技术人员的意见，十分感慨。他们认为这种情况严重地影响工程师与高级技术人员作用的发挥。
    冯秀藻提出气象局在选派留学生、实习生时，太偏重于政治，而忽视了技术，结果派去的人质量低，而有相当水平和实际工作经验的人却没有去，这不仅会影响今后工作不能很快地提高，同时给国家花了更多的钱。顾钧禧说：派工作组出国时，本应选派专家去，却派去了不懂气象的“老”干部。在提拔干部上也同样如此，朱和周提到沈阳台资料组有两个有十多年工作经验的观测员，但领导他们的却仅是一个十七、八岁的小姑娘，因为她是一个青年团员。这不是由工作出发，而是影响了工作。
    谭丁说：北京气象学校有两个科主任，不懂气象，就因为是党员，便占着茅坑不拉屎。
    座谈会中大家对如何使用现有的工程师力量提出了意见。他们认为在气象业务迅速发展，技术力量不足的情况下，如何正确使用工程技术人员是值得研究的。
    王宪钊提出：目前技术人员的最大危机是正在走着“内行变外行、外行变白丁”的道路。平时行政事务堆得一身，忙得昏头昏脑，不要说看些外国的杂志书籍，连本国气象科学动态也无暇过问，长期以来肚子里的忘光了，新的东西没有进来。这是由于行政干部不学不钻，而沉溺于签字发文的“行政领导”方式上。王鹏飞还指出：对技术干部使用上，方向不明确，人事部门常常将一些他认为好的技术干部提到行政工作上来，这是不对的。
