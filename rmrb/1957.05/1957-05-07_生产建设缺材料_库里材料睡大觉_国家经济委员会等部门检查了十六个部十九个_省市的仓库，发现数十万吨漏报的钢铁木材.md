Lack of materials for production and construction while materials sleep in warehouses.

The State Economic Commission and other departments inspected warehouses in sixteen ministries and nineteen provinces and cities, discovering hundreds of thousands of tons of unreported steel and timber.

(Report from our newspaper) The State Economic Commission, the Ministry of Supervision, and the State Statistical Bureau jointly inspected stored materials and uncovered many unreported materials. According to key sample statistics from sixteen ministries in central industry, transportation, and capital construction, and nineteen provinces and cities, including Liaoning and Beijing, a total of over 112,600 tons of underreported steel, over 244,000 cubic meters of timber, over 22,900 tons of pig iron, and over 23,000 tons of cement were discovered.

Among the units sampled, the vast majority had underreported inventory. According to statistics from 1,211 units, the average underreported steel accounted for 12.86% of the original reported amount. According to statistics from 699 units, the average underreported timber was 22.52%. According to statistics from 444 units, the average underreported pig iron was 25.64% less than the original reported amount. Anshan Iron and Steel Company alone underreported more than 8,000 tons of steel product inventory. Chongqing Iron and Steel Company actually had more than 23,000 tons of pig iron but only reported 10,000 tons. When the inspection team went to the Shenyang Power Machinery Plant, the person in charge of the plant "guaranteed" that the figures reported after their general survey were accurate. However, the result was that they also found more than 300 tons of underreported steel. This situation of underreporting inventory exists not only in grassroots enterprises but also in many industrial ministries and administrations at the central level. The reasons for these errors, underreporting, and unclear inventory are mainly that many units have a low level of materials management, and leaders pay attention only to ensuring supply and not enough attention to materials management; a few units have departmentalism and deliberately conceal information. These shortcomings and errors must be quickly corrected.

The results of the inspection show that the artificial tension created by many units in 1956 as a result of not reporting material supplies was one of the reasons why certain materials were in short supply. Many units have seriously exceeded their reserve quotas for raw materials. The national steel material inventory increased quarter by quarter. At the end of 1956, the steel inventory of the Ministry of Construction Engineering was more than double that of the beginning of last year. If calculated based on the average actual consumption of the ministry in 1956, it could be used for more than seven months, exceeding the planned reserve by more than two times. Some enterprises have had to rely on loans to survive because their materials have greatly exceeded their reserve quotas. Many units request larger quantities than they need, underreport their inventories, and grab materials everywhere. It is particularly noteworthy that some units still have not learned this lesson. At the beginning of this year, the Taiyuan Engineering Bureau already had a large backlog of steel, cement, and other materials, but in the first quarter of this year, it applied for more than 11,000 tons of steel, equivalent to 38% of the bureau's actual consumption for the entire last year.

The inspection also revealed that there are some unreasonable phenomena in the current material reserves, such as too many reserve links and levels, and many materials are stored in a dispersed manner, making it difficult to play their due role. Many departments have unsound reserve quotas and lack unified regulations. Some reserve quotas are too large, and some similar enterprises in similar regions have raw material reserve quotas that differ by three or four times. Some departments and enterprise leaders believe that in the case of tight material supply, it is necessary to increase enterprise reserves to ensure supply, so there is a tendency to blindly expand reserve quotas and increase reserves.

Some materials, especially steel, are too much in some places and too little in others, and there is an uneven surplus and shortage, which is also a prominent problem in the current material inventory. In addition to the fact that there are many changes in plans and shortcomings in the material balance and distribution work, there are also contradictions between the production and supply of steel varieties and specifications and actual needs. Many units have a large backlog of materials on the one hand that they cannot use, but on the other hand, they do not have what they need, so they have to use large materials for small purposes, use high-quality materials for inferior purposes, or process and modify them, causing serious waste. Due to the limitations of raw materials, equipment, and technical level, the contradiction between material supply and demand cannot be completely resolved in the short term; however, some material-using units are ignorant of the situation, and some production units simply pursue output value and fail to strictly follow the plan and adapt to needs to produce, which deepens this contradiction.

After this inspection, some departments and enterprises have further clarified their inventories, and some units have begun to take various measures to tap the potential of surplus inventory materials. However, a few departments and enterprises still do not pay attention to this issue.

    生产建设缺材料　库里材料睡大觉
    国家经济委员会等部门检查了十六个部十九个
    省市的仓库，发现数十万吨漏报的钢铁木材
    本报讯　国家经济委员会、监察部和国家统计局联合检查库存物资，查出了许多漏报的材料。据中央工业、交通、基本建设方面的十六个部和辽宁、北京等十九个省市重点抽查统计，共发现少报钢材十一万二千六百多吨，木材二十四万四千多立方公尺，生铁二万二千九百多吨，水泥二万三千多吨。
    在被抽查的单位中，绝大部分单位都有少报库存的现象。根据一千二百十一个单位统计，平均少报的钢材占原报告数的12.86％；据六百九十九个单位的统计，平均少报木材22.52％；据四百四十四个单位统计，生铁平均比原报告数少报25.64％。鞍山钢铁公司一个单位就少报了钢材商品库存八千多吨。重庆钢铁公司实际上有生铁二万三千多吨，只上报了一万吨。沈阳市动力机械厂当检查组去检查时，该厂负责人“保证”他们普查上报的数字没有问题。但是，结果也查出来少报钢材三百多吨。这种少报库存的情况，不仅在基层企业有，而且中央许多工业部和管理局也有。发生这种差错、少报、家底不清现象的原因，主要是很多单位材料管理工作的水平低，领导人员只注意了保证供应的一面，对材料管理工作重视不够；少数单位有本位主义思想，有意打埋伏。这些缺点和错误是须要迅速纠正的。
    检查的结果说明，1956年某些材料供不应求，人为紧张也是原因之一。许多单位原材料超过储备定额的情况很严重。全国钢材的材料库存逐季上升。建筑工程部1956年年底的钢材库存比去年年初增加了一倍多，如果以该部1956年平均实际消费量计算，可以用七个多月，超过计划储备量两倍以上。有的企业由于物资大量超过储备定额，不得不靠借贷度日。许多单位多提申请量，少报库存物资，到处乱抓材料。特别值得注意的是，有些单位到今天仍然没有吸取这个教训。太原工程局今年年初钢材、水泥等材料已经大量积压，可是今年第一季度又申请钢材一万一千多吨，相当于该局去年全年实际消费量的38％。
    检查中还反映，目前在材料的储备上存在着一些不合理的现象，如储备环节、层次过多，许多物资被到处分散储存，难于发挥应有的作用。许多部门的储备定额不健全，缺乏统一的规定。有的储备定额偏大，有的同类企业，同在相近地区，但原材料的储备定额相差三、四倍。有些部门和企业领导人认为在材料供应紧张的情况下，必须增加企业储备才能保证供应，因此有盲目扩大储备定额、增加储备的倾向。
    有些材料，尤其是钢材此多彼少、余缺不均，也是当前材料库存中一个突出的问题。这除了计划变动多，材料的平衡分配工作有缺点以外，钢材品种规格的生产、供应和实际需要还有矛盾。许多单位一方面材料大量积压，用不上，另一方面需要用的却没有，以致不得不大材小用、优材劣用，或者加工改制，造成严重浪费。由于原料、设备和技术水平等条件的限制，材料供需之间的矛盾，不是短期内能够完全解决的；但是，有些用材单位心中无数，有些生产单位单纯追求产值，未能严格按照计划和适应需要去生产，就更加深了这个矛盾。
    经过这次检查，有些部门和企业已进一步摸清了家底，有的单位已开始采取各种措施，挖掘多余库存物资的潜力。可是，也有少数部门和企业仍然没有重视这个问题。
