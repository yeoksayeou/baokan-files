·City Services Department Rectification Dynamics·
    Listening to the Opinions of Democratic Parties
    (Our report) This newspaper reports that on the afternoon of May 14th, the Party Committee of the City Services Department invited representatives from various democratic parties in the department to a discussion. Twelve representatives from organizations such as the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK), China National Democratic Construction Association (CNDCA), and China Democratic League (CDL) attended. The discussion focused on the relationship between members of the democratic parties and the CCP Party Committee, as well as the role of members of the democratic parties in the work of the department.
    He Yigeng said: The number of members of democratic parties in the department is small. To play a role, it is necessary to solve the development problems of democratic parties. Some political activities, such as listening to reports, should give consideration to members of the democratic parties. Liu Jiaying (female) said: There are only seven members of the RCCK in the City Services Department. Because they are too scattered, no organization has been established so far. I hope the Party Committee can help our organization carry out activities. Ma Ke said: The CDL only has two members, and it cannot coordinate with various aspects of work. Wu Yuchen said: Many cadres in the department do not sufficiently recognize the role of democratic parties, and there is a phenomenon of "respecting but staying away." I think the Party Committee does not pay enough attention to us either. Wang Yi said: I feel that the relationship between the Communist Party and the democratic parties is mutually polite. We examine each other at meetings, and then nothing happens afterwards. Shen Ping said: With so few members of democratic parties, how can we play a role? I am not clear about this. In the future, I should take the initiative to contact the Party Committee, but the Party Committee should also seek our opinions and exchange information with each other.
    At the end of the discussion, Yang Yichen, Minister of the City Services Department, spoke on behalf of the Party Committee. He said: In the past, the City Services Department's Party Committee did not pay enough attention to the question of how to give play to the role of democratic party organizations. In conjunction with this rectification, please offer more opinions from all aspects. As for the problems of democratic party organizations in the work of the department, everyone should study them together, and as long as they can be solved, we should try to solve them gradually. Correcting the Phenomenon of Rectification Impeding Work
    (Our report) This newspaper reports that the Party Group of the City Services Department held a meeting on the evening of May 13th to study the rectification learning situation of the department last week. The meeting believed that the Rectification Office had the shortcoming of being too hasty in leading rectification learning. For example, the regulation that four and a half hours should be devoted to learning every afternoon would inevitably hinder work and violate the principle put forward by the Central Government that rectification and work should not be neglected. Furthermore, the requirement to study documents for the first three days and expose thoughts for the next three days is not feasible in practice because the time is too short and there is not enough time for ideological preparation.
    In order to correct the above shortcomings, the Party Group decided: In the first month, focus on studying documents, organizing discussions, correcting the understanding of Party members, and widely listening to the opinions of non-Party masses. Study time: No more than three afternoons per week. The Party Group emphasized: Party member cadres at the bureau and department level and above should talk to each other, eliminate concerns, and this will be conducive to the normal progress of the rectification movement.

    ·城市服务部整风动态·
    听取各民主党派的意见
    本报讯　14日下午，中共城市服务部机关党委邀请本机关各民主党派人员座谈，出席的有民革、民建、民盟等组织的代表十二人。发言内容集中在各民主党派成员与中共党委的关系以及各民主党派成员在机关工作中的作用问题上。
    贺益耕说：各民主党派的成员在机关里人数很少，要想发挥作用，一定要解决民主党派的发展问题。有些政治活动像听报告等，应给各民主党派成员以照顾。刘甲樱（女）说：民革在城市服务部的成员只有七人，因为太分散，至今还未成立组织。我希望机关党委能帮助我们的组织进行活动。马克说：民盟只有两个盟员，同各方面工作配合不上。吴玉忱说：机关里不少干部对民主党派的作用认识不够，有“敬而远之”的现象。我认为机关党委对我们重视也不够。王毅说：我感到共产党和民主党派的关系是互相客气。开会时彼此检查检查，会后就没事了。沈平说：民主党派成员少，怎样才能发挥作用？我是不明确的。今后我应当主动和机关党委连系，但党委也要找我们交换意见，互相通气。
    座谈会结束的时候，城市服务部部长杨一辰代表机关党委发了言，他说：过去城市服务部的党委对如何发挥民主党派组织作用等问题注意是不够的。结合这次整风，请大家从各方面多提意见。至于民主党派组织在机关工作中的问题，大家应该互相研究，只要是可能解决的，都要设法逐步解决。纠正整风妨碍工作的现象
    本报讯　城市服务部机关党组13日晚开会，研究上周机关整风学习情况。会议认为整风办公室在领导整风学习中有要求过急的缺点。如规定每天下午抽出四个半小时学习，势必妨碍工作，违背了中央提出的整风和工作两不误的原则。又如，要求前三天学文件，后三天暴露思想，由于时间过于短促，思想酝酿不够，实际上行不通。
    为纠正以上缺点，党组决定：第一个月集中学习文件，组织交谈，端正党员的认识，广泛听取非党群众的意见。学习时间：每周不超过三个下午。党组强调指出：局、处长以上党员干部，应该互相谈心，消除顾虑，才会有利于整风运动的正常进行。（李根蒂）
