Editor's Note: After the People's Daily published the statement of the State Council spokesman on the current market price issue on April 30, many readers wrote letters expressing their support, believing that the statement helped everyone understand many practical situations. At the same time, some readers have raised their own opinions on the current rise in the prices of certain commodities. We have now selected some letters to publish below.
    
    Price Increases Should Not Be Too Concentrated
    It is correct for the state to appropriately increase the sales prices of certain commodities in order to balance the state's financial revenue and expenditure, balance market supply and demand, and promote production. However, I have the following opinions on this price change:

    I. Price increases and decreases are common phenomena in a commodity economy. A slight increase in the price of some goods does not equal price volatility. However, if the types of commodities with price increases are too many and the timing of the price increases is too concentrated, it is easy to create the illusion of price volatility. Therefore, I suggest that in future price adjustment work, the types of commodities with price increases, the timing of price increases, and the magnitude of price increases should be more dispersed.

    II. The people are satisfied with the price stability of recent years, but they have great opinions on the large purchase and sales price differences of state-owned commerce. The purchase and sales price differences for pork, brown sugar, tobacco leaves, and hemp are all above 45%, and some are even as high as 300%. It is understood that the average purchase and sales price difference rate of various professional companies under the Ministry of Commerce was more than 40% in 1955, of which taxes and profits accounted for only 50%, and commercial expenses accounted for about half. The people have many opinions on high commercial expenses. State-owned commerce should study and improve the composition of expenses over the years.　Zhao Qingxin

### 提价不宜太集中

    编者按：4月30日本报发表了国务院发言人对当前市场物价问题的谈话以后，许多读者来信表示拥护，认为这个谈话帮助大家了解了许多实际情况。同时，有些读者对当前某些商品价格的上涨，提出了自己的意见。现在我们选择一部分来信发表在下面。
    提价不宜太集中
    国家适当提高某些商品的销售价格，以便平衡国家的财政收支，平衡市场供求和促进生产，这是正确的。不过，对这次物价变动，我还有以下的意见：
    一、物价升降，是商品经济中的经常现象。部分物价上升一些，并不等于物价波动。但是，如果提价的商品种类太多，提价的时间太集中，容易使人产生物价波动的错觉。因此我建议今后在调整物价工作中，应当把提价商品的种类、提价的时间和幅度分散一些。
    二、人民对这些年来物价的稳定是满意的，但对国营商业的购销差价偏大则有很大意见。猪肉、红糖、烟叶、麻的购销差价都在45％以上，有的甚至高到300％。据了解，商业部所属各专业公司平均购销差价率，1955年为40％多，其中税金和利润仅占50％，商业费用占到一半左右。人民对商业费用大意见很多，国营商业应把历年来的费用构成加以研究改进。　赵清心
