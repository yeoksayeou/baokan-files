Xinhua News Agency, May 20th. Twelve delegates continued to speak at the Third National Congress of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League on May 20th.

Zhang Hongjun, Deputy Secretary of the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League and Secretary of the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, criticized the shortcomings of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League for being divorced from reality. He suggested that the next Central Committee, especially the organs of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, should conscientiously examine its work and ideological style in the spirit of rectification.

Lu Jindong, Deputy Director of the Organization Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, and Zhang Delong, Secretary of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League, spoke on the construction of the Communist Youth League's grassroots organizations and the work of rectifying the League, respectively. Lu Jindong pointed out that the central issue in strengthening the construction of the League in the future is to strengthen the work of the League's grassroots organizations, so that the grassroots organizations truly become the core of uniting young people and the school for educating League members.

Before the commencement of the general meeting speeches today, Zhuang Mingli, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, and youth representatives from Yugoslavia, Mongolia, Britain, and Japan delivered congratulatory speeches at the meeting.

Lu Zhao, Deputy Secretary-General of the Congress, read out the congratulatory telegrams from the Central Committee of the Polish Socialist Youth Union and the Central Council of the Polish Rural Youth Union to the Congress.
