    Tian Han Brews Two New Scripts
    On April 30th, a train from Xi'an to Beijing carried a white-haired but spirited traveler – the drama activist Tian Han. This was his fourth trip in two years to understand the situation. He said, "I'm still unfamiliar with the Northwest." This time, he specifically chose Xi'an and Yan'an for his inspection.
    Readers may be interested in the creative plans of this veteran playwright who has written many plays. Upon returning from his trip to the Northwest, he will begin writing two spoken drama scripts. To commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the spoken drama movement, he will write a script reflecting the struggle life of the National Salvation Drama Troupe and the Resistance Drama Troupe during the Anti-Japanese War. At that time, under the leadership of the Party, these drama troupes brought progressive drama from central cities such as Shanghai to inland towns, villages, factories, and troops; and began to integrate with the broad masses of the people. Comrade Tian Han plans to depict how this drama team, under the fervent patriotic emotions of the early stage of the Anti-Japanese War, overcame unprecedented hardships and difficulties, making literature and art "go to the countryside" and "enlist in the army"; how they listened to the opinions of the military and civilians in the new and difficult environment, and continuously improved their performance art, clarifying the chaotic thinking in this regard through struggle. As the situation of the Anti-Japanese War reversed, they struggled with the complex political environment with outstanding wisdom and perseverance. In this script, he will adopt his usual method of using more scenes to express the content.
    The other script he will write in the second half of the year is about the changes of opera performers before and after liberation; depicting the several stages they experienced in the opera reform work, from crude and conservative to "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend." The play will also touch on the relationship between performers and cadres; Comrade Tian Han said that as one of the opera work cadres, he will launch a struggle against bureaucracy, subjectivism and sectarianism through this play. The main characters in both scripts are his past or present partners. Since last year, the author has left Beijing four times, traveled to more than a dozen provinces, extensively and carefully understood the drama activities and the lives of the performers, and collected relevant information.
    I heard a young man living around Comrade Tian Han say, "The door of Tian Lao's house is always open." Only then did I realize how the people and events of the drama circle entered his heart. (Lan)

    田汉酝酿两个新剧本
    4月30日那天，从西安开到北京的列车上，载着一位满头白发但是精神抖擞的旅客——戏剧活动家田汉。这已经是他两年来第四次出外了解情况。他说：“我对西北还是陌生的。”这一次视察，他特意选了西安和延安。
    读者也许在关心这位曾经写过不少剧本的老剧作家的创作计划。他从西北旅行归来，就要开始写作两个话剧剧本。为了纪念话剧运动五十年，他要写一个反映抗日战争时期救亡演剧队和抗敌演剧队的斗争生活的剧本。当时，这些演剧队在党的领导下，从上海等中心城市把进步戏剧带到内地的城镇、农村，工厂和部队；开始和广大的人民群众相结合。田汉同志打算描写这一支戏剧队伍怎样在抗战初期火热的爱国情绪下，克服着从未尝过的艰苦困难，使文艺“下乡”“入伍”；怎样在新的艰苦环境下听取军民的意见，不断改进他们的演出艺术，经过斗争澄清这一方面的紊乱思想。随着抗战形势的逆转，他们又怎样以出色的智慧和坚毅，同复杂的政治环境作斗争。这个剧本，他将采取他惯用的场次较多的表现手法。
    下半年他将要写的另一个剧本，是解放前后戏曲艺人的变化；描绘他们在戏曲改革工作中所经历的，由粗暴、保守到“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的几个阶段。剧中也将接触到艺人同干部的关系；田汉同志说他作为戏曲工作干部之一，将通过这个戏展开反对官僚主义、主观主义和宗派主义的斗争。两个剧本中的主要人物都是作者过去的或者现在的伙伴。从去年以来，作者四次离京出外，跑了十来个省，广泛而又细致地了解戏剧活动和艺人的生活，收集有关的资料。
    我听到一位生活在田汉同志身边的年轻人说：“田老家的大门总是敞开着的。”我才体会到戏剧界的人和事是怎样走进他心里的。（兰）
