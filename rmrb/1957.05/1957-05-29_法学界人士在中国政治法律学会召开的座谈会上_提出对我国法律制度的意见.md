Xinhua News Agency, May 27th: The China Political Science and Law Association held a symposium this afternoon, inviting legal scholars to attend.

More than ninety people participated in the symposium, including directors of the Political Science and Law Association in Beijing, law professors and lecturers from universities, and legal scholars working in various government agencies. Leading Party member cadres from central political and legal organs also attended the symposium.

Wu Defeng, Vice President of the Political Science and Law Association, said at the beginning of the symposium that legal scholars in the capital are scattered across various agencies and schools. Some of their opinions have already been raised in their respective units, but some felt that opinions closely related to legal matters should be specifically addressed in a dedicated meeting. Therefore, the Political Science and Law Association decided to hold this symposium, hoping that legal scholars would boldly express their opinions, help the Communist Party in its rectification campaign, and improve its work.

A total of five people spoke at today's symposium.

Wu Wenhan, Associate Professor at Lanzhou University, spoke first, believing that the "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" policy has a significant "soul-summoning" effect on China's legal community. This is because the older generation of China's legal community was completely discredited, and the younger generation was obsessed with dogmatism, so both needed "soul-summoning." Wu Wenhan said that after liberation, most law schools across the country were abolished, dissolved, and merged, leaving very few remaining. The Law School of Lanzhou University suffered the same fate. During the ideological reform and judicial reform movements, those who had studied old law were subjected to even greater discrimination and attacks. The Party and Chairman Mao's proposal of the "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" policy nourished withered trees and grasses and revived those who had been frightened out of their wits.

Wu Wenhan believes that some leading cadres now have legal nihilistic ideas, ignore the Constitution, and believe that substituting the Party for the government is natural, that Party orders are above the law, and that individual Party members' words are considered "golden rules." All of this violates the rule of law. He said that in today's rectification campaign, it is necessary to be "cautious with punishment" and, according to the spirit of the "Eighth National Congress," emphasize the protection of citizens' democratic rights. For past wrongly judged or misjudged cases, judicial and procuratorial organs should conduct investigations and redress them; individual illegal acts of deliberately framing innocent people should also be dealt with as a prelude to establishing a legal atmosphere and strengthening the rule of law.

Wu Wenhan said that there is an invisible "ditch" and "wall" existing within the legal community, and sectarianists bear the primary responsibility. To rectify, we must first rectify this sectarianism. Secondly, it is necessary to bridge the relationship between legal theory and legal practice and abolish unnecessary confidentiality systems. Discussions should be launched on the academic system of legal science. Wu Wenhan also suggested the rapid establishment of a law research institute and that consideration be given to merging the Institute of International Relations of the Chinese Academy of Sciences with the law research institute to form a law research institute.

Wu Jialin, a lecturer at Renmin University of China, focused on his opinions on China's political and legal systems in his speech. He said that the system of People's Congresses is superior and incomparably better than the bourgeois parliamentary system, but we have problems in some aspects of applying the political system, even serious problems. Leading cadres have many problems in applying the system. The Party is the leading force of the People's Congress system, but there should be boundaries and distinctions between the two. While realizing Party leadership, it should not substitute the Party for the government. Substituting the Party for the government involves political system issues. Wu Jialin said that some local People's Congresses have not been convened as required or in a timely manner. Although the central National People's Congress is better, it is not normal either. Some local People's Congresses have a tendency toward formalism, lacking standing organs or standing committees, and cannot supervise the work of the government during adjournment, failing to truly function as organs of power.

Regarding the legal system, Wu Jialin said that it is necessary to "have laws to abide by" and "laws must be enforced." Some departments have not enforced laws. The central highest leading organs do not have a strong sense of the rule of law, and there are even phenomena of not complying with the law, which should be resolutely corrected; otherwise, the upper levels will influence the lower levels, causing endless harm. He cited examples such as the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress passing a resolution in 1955 to abolish the Xinjiang Province establishment and establish the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, while Article 27, Section 11 of the Constitution stipulates that the power to approve the division of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government is the power of the National People's Congress. Another example is that the Second Session of the National People's Congress in July 1955 authorized the Standing Committee to formulate laws of a partial nature, while Article 22 of the Constitution stipulates that the National People's Congress is the only organ that exercises the state's legislative power. Yet another example is that Article 44 of the Electoral Law stipulates that voter lists should be announced 30 days before the election, but the State Council's instructions on the 1956 election work stipulated that "efforts should be made to complete the election work of a grassroots unit in about 20 days."

Wu Jialin finally put forward four suggestions. First, improve the political system, adjust some uncoordinated links, and correctly use the system. Second, strengthen legislative work and put legislative activities on the agenda of the National People's Congress. Third, strengthen democratic and legal education for staff of state organs, with central leading organs first setting an example in strictly abiding by the rule of law. Fourth, carry out legal research work, re-examine the legal education system, and improve the work of the Political Science and Law Association and the Law Publishing House.

Hong Dingzhong, a researcher at the Ministry of Internal Affairs, put forward three points: First, the Political Science and Law Association's contact surface is too narrow, neglecting the popularization of legal scientific knowledge and failing to appropriately advance legal scientific research work, and many potential forces have not been explored; second, it is currently necessary to make some preparations before the scientific advance and replenish all necessary basic knowledge; third, some foreign books published by the Law Publishing House have errors in translation, but they are not open to hearing others' opinions.

Li Zuyin, a State Council Counselor, believes that if a law research institute is established, the legal research work in our country can be improved a step further. He also suggested that the Political Science and Law Association should establish an annual meeting system to make the annual meeting a forum for academic debate in the legal community. The Political Science and Law Research magazine can be changed from a bi-monthly to a monthly magazine, making it a garden for academic debate for legal scholars across the country. He finally hoped that the Political Science and Law Association could summarize the experience of the rule of law in the old liberated areas and after liberation and conduct a good study of Chairman Mao Zedong's ideas on the rule of law expressed in many of his works.

Zhang Hongzeng, former Associate Professor of Wuhan University, who is now working at the Institute of International Relations, said that this rectification campaign should first rectify the sectarianism in legal education. In his speech, he focused on criticizing the sectarian style of Li Wenjun, former Deputy Director of the Law Department of Wuhan University and Secretary of the Party Branch.

The symposium will continue.

### 法学界人士在中国政治法律学会召开的座谈会上  提出对我国法律制度的意见

    法学界人士在中国政治法律学会召开的座谈会上
    提出对我国法律制度的意见
    新华社27日讯  中国政治法律学会今天下午邀请法学界人士举行座谈会。
    参加座谈会的有政法学会在京理事，高等学校的法律教授、讲师以及在各机关工作的法学界人士等共九十多人。中央政法机关的党员负责干部也参加了座谈会。
    政法学会副会长吴德峰在座谈会开始的时候说，首都法学界人士散布在各个机关和学校。他们有些意见已在所在单位提了，但有些人觉得有些与法律方面有密切关系的意见还要专门开会提一提。因此，政法学会决定开这个座谈会，希望法学界人士大胆提意见，帮助共产党整风，改进工作。
    今天在座谈会上发言的共五人。
    兰州大学副教授吴文翰首先发言，他认为，“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针对中国法学界具有“招魂”的重大作用，因为中国法学界老的一辈被一棍子打死了，新的一辈被教条主义迷住了窍，所以都需要“招魂”。吴文翰说，解放后，全国各地的法学院大都被取消、解散和归并，存者无几。兰州大学法学院遭到了同样的命运。在思想改造和司法改革运动里，学过旧法学的人遭到了更大的歧视和打击。党和毛主席提出“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，润泽了枯树衰草，复苏了吓掉了魂的人。
    吴文翰认为，现在有一部分领导干部有法律的虚无主义思想，忽视宪法，认为以党代政是当然的，党的命令高于法令，党员个人的言语自认是“金科玉律”。这都是违反法制的。他说，在整风的今天，要“慎刑”，要根据“八大”的精神，强调保障公民的民主权利，对于过去错判、误判的案件，由司法、检察等机关进行调查平反；对于个别故意“出入”人罪的违法行为，也应该进行处理，作为建立法制风气和加强法制的先声。
    吴文翰说，现在在法学界中间有一道无形的“沟”和“墙”存在，宗派主义者要负主要的责任。要整风先要整这个宗派主义。其次是必须沟通法学理论与法律实践的关系，废除不必要的保密制度。在法律科学的学制方面展开讨论。吴文翰并且建议迅速设立法学研究所，也可以考虑把中国科学院国际关系研究所与法学研究所合并成法学研究所。
    中国人民大学讲师吴家麟在发言中着重谈到对我国政治制度和法律制度的意见。他说，人民代表大会制是优越的，比资产阶级议会制度有无比的优越，但我们在运用政治制度的某些环节上有毛病，甚至有严重的毛病。领导干部在对制度的运用中存在不少问题。党是人民代表大会制的领导力量，但两者应有界限，应有所区别，既要实现党的领导，又不能以党代政。以党代政就牵涉到政治制度问题。吴家麟说，有些地方的人民代表大会没有按规定召开，开得也不及时。中央的全国人民代表大会虽然好一点，但也不正常。有些地方的人民代表大会有形式主义偏向，没有常务机关，也没有常设委员会，在闭会期间不能监督政府工作，没有真正起权力机关的作用。
    关于法律制度问题，吴家麟说，要作到“有法可依”，“有法必依”。有些部门没有作到有法必依。中央最高领导机关法制观念也不强，甚至还有不遵守法制的现象，应该坚决纠正，否则上行下效，贻害无穷。他举例说，1955年全国人民代表大会常务委员会通过了撤销新疆省建制和成立新疆维吾尔自治区的决议，而宪法第二十七条第十一款规定批准省、自治区和直辖市的划分是全国人民代表大会的职权。又如1955年7月全国人民代表大会第二次会议通过，授权常务委员会制定部分性质的法律，而宪法第二十二条规定全国人民代表大会是行使国家立法权的唯一机关。又如选举法第四十四条规定选民名单应在选举的三十天以前公布，但国务院关于1956年选举工作的指示则规定“争取在二十天左右完成一个基层单位的选举工作”。
    吴家麟最后提出四点建议。一、健全政治制度，调整失调的一些环节，并正确运用这个制度。二、加强立法工作，把立法活动提到全国人民代表大会议事日程上。三、加强对国家机关工作人员的民主和法制教育，中央领导机关首先在严格遵守法制方面做出榜样。四、开展法学研究工作，重新审查法律教育制度，改进政治法律学会和法律出版社的工作。
    内务部研究员洪鼎钟提出三点意见：第一是政法学会的联系面太窄，忽视了法律科学知识的普及工作，没有适当地把法律科学研究工作向前推进一步，许多潜在的力量没有发掘出来；第二，目前需要作些科学进军前的准备工作，要补足一切必要的基本知识。第三，法律出版社出版的一些外国书籍在翻译方面有错误，但又不虚心听别人意见。
    国务院参事李祖荫认为如成立了法学研究所，那就可以把我国法律研究工作提高一步。他还建议政法学会要建立年会制度，使年会成为法学界争鸣的论坛。政法研究杂志可由两月刊改为月刊，使之成为全国法学界人士争鸣的园地。他最后希望政法学会可以把老解放区和解放后的法制经验总结一下，把毛泽东主席在许多著作中表现出的法制思想加以很好的研究。
    现在国际关系研究所工作的前武汉大学副教授张鸿增说，这次整风首先要整法学教育工作上的宗派主义。他在讲话中着重地批评了前武汉大学法律系副主任、党总支书记李文钧的宗派主义作风。
    座谈会将继续进行。
