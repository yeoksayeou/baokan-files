    Encounter on the Road
    Yang You
    The girl had just returned from her maternal grandma's house. Grandma had asked her, "Does my girl have a fiancé yet?" She turned her head away and said, "Not yet!" Grandma said, "Are there few people in your village? If not, grandma's village has plenty of young lads; grandma will find you one!" The girl pouted and said, "I won't find one from the village!"
    The girl boarded the train, glancing sideways at the young man sitting next to her. The young man had thick eyebrows and large eyes, wearing a black hat tilted to one side. He wore a blue cloth uniform with the collar open, revealing a red flannel shirt underneath. He wore blue corduroy pants and semi-worn yellow leather shoes. As the girl was observing him, the young man happened to turn his head, and their eyes met. The young man started a conversation, "Going home?"
    "Yes! Are you coming from Tianjin? Where are you going?" the girl asked generously.
    "...To the Northeast," the young man replied vaguely.
    "That's great! You must be from a factory! Some people from our village have gone there too."
    And so they began to talk. The girl spoke about this and that in her village, and the young man listened with fascination, saying, "The way you describe it sounds so good, I'd like to go and see it!"
    "That's fine! You can come back with me; we have empty rooms in our house. You workers should come and see our countryside," the girl said with a smile.
    "Is that alright? Your mother doesn't know. That won't do, will it?" he replied, though he seemed already willing.
    When they arrived at Xiaozhan, both of them got off the train. The girl walked lightly ahead, and the young man carried her small baggage behind her. On the road, she said, "It doesn't matter; in this day and age, no one is feudal."
    Seeing her daughter's face flushed and smiling, and bringing someone back with her, the mother understood half of it. She quickly invited them to sit on the kang. As the mother was about to ask questions, she saw the girl winking at her, so she quickly stopped and turned to the stove to make dumplings.
    After eating, the girl proudly took the young man to the village, telling everyone they met, "This is Old Liu, from a factory in the Northeast." Like a gust of wind, the word spread throughout the village: "This girl has brought back a son-in-law."
    That night, the girl said to her mother, "Mother, what are you asking? Look at what he wears, what he has; none of that is better in our village. What future is there with a farmer?"
    "My daughter has a good eye," the mother said, looking at her daughter's dark eyes.
    After staying for three days, Old Liu said:
    "I'm going to visit my aunt's family in Qinhuangdao. Would you like to go and see it too?" The girl heard this and said, "Sure! There's not much work to do right now; I'll wander around too." The girl made the decision, and the mother didn't dare say anything, hurriedly packing the new clothes she had made after the autumn harvest.
    After a few days, the girl returned, put the small package on the cabinet, and climbed onto the kang. Seeing her daughter happy, the mother asked, "Did you go to his aunt's house?"
    "No, his aunt has moved! Couldn't find it. We stayed in a small inn."
    "My dear, what's his name? Where does he work in the factory?"
    "Mother, you've stumped me; I forgot to ask him! It doesn't matter; he'll come to pick me up in a month when he gets his salary!" Both mother and daughter laughed.
    A month, two months, three months passed, and that Old Liu was still nowhere to be seen! The girl went to the village entrance to wait every day. The mother became anxious and said, "This man is no good; let's go to the government!"
    The girl cried, sobbing and saying, "But who can I accuse?"

    路遇
  　杨友
    姑娘刚从姥姥家回来。姥姥曾经问她：“姑娘有了婆婆家啦？”她一扭头说：“还没有哇！”姥姥说：“你们那村人还少了？要不行，姥姥这村有的是年青小伙子，姥姥给你找！”姑娘小嘴一翘，说：“我不找村里的！”
    姑娘坐上了火车，从眼角打量着身旁坐着的小伙子。小伙子粗眉大眼，歪戴着一顶黑帽子，上身是蓝布制服，敞开领口，露出里面的红绒衣，下面穿着一条蓝灯芯绒裤子，脚上踩着两只半旧的黄皮鞋。姑娘正打量着，恰巧小伙子一转头，四只眼正碰上。小伙子可就搭讪了：“回家啊？”
    “是啊！你打天津来？到哪儿去呀？”姑娘问得很大方。
    “……到东北去。”小伙子含糊地回答。
    “那好啊！你一定是工厂的人吧！我们村里也有人到那儿去。”
    就这么交谈上了。姑娘说到村里这样、那样的事，小伙子听得入了迷，说：“瞧你说得那么好，我都想去看看了呢！
    “那行啊！你跟我回去，我们家有空房。你们工人该到我们农村看看。”姑娘笑着说。
     “那好吗？你娘又不知道。哪里行呢？”对方已经愿意了。
    到了小站，两个人都下了火车。姑娘在前面走得轻飘飘的，小伙子在后面背着她的小包袱。路上她说：“没啥关系，这年头谁也不兴封建。”
    瞧着女儿脸上红扑扑的，嘴角透着笑，身后边还带着一个人回来，为娘的心里就明白了一半，赶快让炕上坐。娘刚要盘问，见姑娘一个劲儿使眼色，连忙住了嘴，转身到锅沿上去捏饺子去了。
    吃完了饭，姑娘带着小伙子大摇大摆地到村里去了，碰上人就说：“这是老刘，东北工厂的。”一阵风似地，村里人传遍了：“这姑娘带了女婿回来了。”
    晚上，姑娘和娘说：“娘，你问个啥？你瞧瞧人家穿的、戴的，哪点不比咱村里的强。跟个庄稼人有啥出息？”
    “我们闺女有眼色。”娘瞧着女儿黑黑的大眼睛说。
    一住三天，老刘说：
    “我到秦皇岛我姑家去瞧瞧，你也去看看吗？”姑娘一听，说：“行啊！这会儿又没啥活作，我也逛逛去。”姑娘一作主，娘也没敢说什么，匆忙把秋后做的几件新衣服都包去了。
    过了些天，姑娘回来了，把小包往柜上一放，就上了炕。娘瞧着女儿高兴，问：“到他姑家啦？”
    “没有，他姑搬家啦！没找着。住在小客店里了。”
    “我儿，他叫个啥名字呢？到底在那儿工厂作工？”
    “娘倒问住我了，我还忘了问他呢！不碍事，他过一个月发了薪就来接我去呢！”娘儿俩都笑了。
    一个月、两个月、三个月过去了，那位老刘还没影儿呢！姑娘天天到村头上去望着。娘急了，说：“这人不行啊，咱们找政府去吧！”
    姑娘哭啦，抽抽咽咽地说：“可我去告谁呀？”
