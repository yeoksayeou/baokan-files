The Beijing Chinese Painting Academy has been established.

This is an academy with a special character.

When people see the words "Chinese Painting," they naturally understand that it refers to our country's inherent, traditional painting. However, over the years, there have been many views and discussions regarding these two words.

I remember at Mr. Qi Baishi's birthday banquet four years ago, Premier Zhou asked me: What is the most appropriate name for Chinese painting? At that time, I said that academics are public property. Strictly speaking, one cannot distinguish which academic or artistic field belongs to which country or region. However, before the world becomes a unified whole, for the sake of easy reference or identification, geographical markers are added to certain things. Sometimes, due to historical customs and patriotic feelings, certain things are given commonly used or specific symbols to arouse public sympathy. This is not necessarily a bad thing. For example, "domestic goods" are used to distinguish them from "foreign goods," and "traditional Chinese medicine" is used to distinguish it from "Western medicine." Strictly speaking, this is not very logical, but since habit has become nature, it may as well be commonly used. If there are simpler and clearer words that can replace them, that would naturally be better. At that time, Zhou Yang, Zheng Zhenduo, Lao She, Xu Beihong, Yu Feian and other comrades were present, and after thinking for a long time, they could not come up with better words, so it became an unresolved issue. Later, the "Beijing Chinese Painting Research Association" used the three characters "Chinese Painting," the "Ink and Wash Painting Department" of the Central Academy of Fine Arts used the three characters "Ink and Wash Painting," and some advocated using "National Painting" or "Traditional Painting," but there was still no consensus.

This time, the State Council, in order to emphasize the research, understanding, sorting out, and inheritance of the excellent traditions of inherent art, proposed and passed the establishment of Beijing and Shanghai Chinese Painting Academies at the State Council meeting on June 1, 1956, for the purpose of cultivating Chinese painters. The one in Shanghai is led by the Shanghai Municipal People's Committee, and the one in Beijing is directly led by the Ministry of Culture. It is also stipulated that the academies should not only absorb Chinese painters with higher academic levels, but also absorb those with high craftsmanship but not necessarily high academic levels. Veteran painters participating in the academy's work do not have to be concentrated in the academy; they can teach at home, in their studios, or by adopting the apprentice method. The preparatory committee for the Chinese Painting Academy was established by the Ministry of Culture to implement the plan, the outline of which is to "inherit the excellent traditions of Chinese classical (including folk) painting art and further develop and improve it. The specific tasks of the academy are to promote Chinese painting creation, cultivate specialized talents in Chinese painting, conduct theoretical research on Chinese painting, and be responsible for promoting and guiding foreign Chinese painting creation." In this way, the name and substance of the academy will be defined and can be followed in the future.

The content of this academy will be different from that of general schools. Its actual organization and work are still under careful discussion. Generally, it may adopt the inherent "academy" and "painting academy" systems of our country, and the modern and contemporary "school" and "research institute" systems, integrating them together. This is of course an attempt, and whether it will be successful remains to be tested. Both "academy" and "painting academy" have their advantages, but times are different, and they should not be rigidly copied. The "school" and "research institute" are not entirely suitable for the nature of the "painting academy," so careful consideration and improvement are not easy.

Our cultural heritage is extremely rich. Although it has suffered various losses over the years, there are still many things that have been inherited. Unfortunately, in the past, masterpieces were often exclusively owned by emperors, nobles, and wealthy merchants, leading to a disconnect with the general public, especially in the area of painting, which was almost separated from the masses. However, the love of beauty is human nature, and in our country, from cities to villages, from decorations to daily necessities, there are pictures everywhere, and folk creations are especially rich in unique products. Even patriotic literati, in resisting reactionary rule, created their own schools, and fraternal ethnic groups, in preserving local customs, passed down skills. Moreover, over the generations, much foreign nourishment has been absorbed. Therefore, within the national style, there are actually various blood types. Unfortunately, for many years, it was obscured by feudal rule, covered with their outer garments, resulting in the burial of the true spirit of our country's art and gradually only the shell remained. Especially in the last thirty to fifty years, few people in the Chinese painting circle advocated and supported it, resulting in a state of anarchy. Occasionally, one or two comrades could only admire themselves in solitude, making it difficult to revitalize the declining trend and shift the fortune. This is naturally not necessarily the responsibility of Chinese painters, but the fact that it is trending downward is undeniable. Now, when misfortune turns into blessing, the leadership's emphasis on Chinese painting has already begun, but what the effect will be, I am afraid, is still as Comrade Zhou Yang said, the future of Chinese painting depends on the efforts of Chinese painters. This topic is quite serious, and I deeply hope that domestic painters will work together for this purpose and unite for this purpose. Especially at this time when there is a gap between generations, the responsibility of carrying on the past and opening up the future rests on the shoulders of today's painters, so the responsibility is especially heavy.

Speaking of the work of the "painting academy," it will roughly consist of creation, research, and teaching, but it is not easy to do well just these. Because our country has never had a more complete history of fine arts or painting. Past works and records are often fragmented and difficult to summarize, and more works of past generations have been destroyed. Although a considerable number have been recovered and newly discovered recently, it is not easy to make a systematic explanation of each of them. There are also many places that are not easy to express accurately using today's popular language consciousness. There are also many painters who are not accustomed to using language; their skills and insights can only be passed down orally or grasped implicitly. Therefore, the State Council's provision of taking apprentices is very correct and essential. At this time of letting a hundred flowers bloom, on our own garden, we should let the inherent variety of colors radiate even more brilliance. This is the obligation of our country's artists, and it can also be said to be the expectation of the masses. In the past, our people abandoned their obligations to their motherland's culture and art, allowing cultural aggression schemers to steal our country's artistic wealth, monopolize our country's art business, and hinder our country's art activities. This is truly shameful. Today, with the increase of our international status, we also have the responsibility to provide and promote culture and art to the world. Many friendly people are eager for us to provide some inherent art for them to emulate, but we still lack all collection and sorting. As the ancient saying goes, sitting on a mountain of treasures and not knowing it, this not only shows our emptiness and negligence, but also when the cultural high tide follows the economic high tide, we still cannot come up with anything to meet the needs of the people, which will be too late to regret. Today, the government's move is just right for the times. I hope that the elderly, middle-aged, and young people in China's painting circles will rise up together and move forward together.

### 北京中国画院的成立

    北京中国画院的成立
                  叶恭绰
    北京国画院成立了。
    这是一所具有特别性质的学院。
   “国画”这两个字，大家一看见，很自然的会了解到是指我国固有的传统的绘画，然而这两个字，多年以来，也很有不少的见解和讨论。
    记得四年前齐白石先生生日的宴会上，周总理就曾问我：中国画的名称，究竟以怎样为的当？其时我即说学术本是公物，严格的说，不能区分某种学术或艺术，是那一国那一地的，但是世界未大同以前，为便于称引或指认起见，于某些事物，加以地域标志，又有时为历史习惯和爱国情感关系，于某些事物，加上沿用或特定的符号，以引起大众的同感，这也是未尝不好的。譬如国货用以别于洋货，中医用以别于西医等等，严格说来，并不太合逻辑，然而习惯已成自然，则也不妨通用，如果有更简单明了的字样，可以代替，自然更好，当时在座的人，尚有周扬、郑振铎、老舍、徐悲鸿、于非暗诸同志，想了好久，也拟不出更好的字样，因此成为悬案。其后“北京中国画研究会”用了“中国画”三字，中央美术学院“彩墨画系”用了“彩墨画”三字，又有主张用“民族画”、“传统画”的，但仍莫衷一是。
    这一次国务院为注重对于固有艺术优良传统的研究认识、整理传习起见，于1956年6月1日的国务会议，提出通过设立北京、上海两个国画院，为培养国画家之用。上海一个由上海市人民委员会领导，北京一个，由文化部直接领导，并规定画院不仅吸收学理水平较高的国画家，而且还应吸收虽然学理水平不高但手艺高的人。参加画院工作的老画家，不必集中到画院，可以在家里，或到画室里，或采用带徒弟的方法教学。并由文化部组设中国画院筹备委员会通过实施方案，其纲领为“继承中国古典（包括民间）绘画艺术的优良传统，并且使它进一步发展和提高。画院的具体任务，是繁荣国画创作，培养国画专门人材，并对国画作理论的探讨，及负责院外国画创作的推动和辅导工作”。如此，则学院的名实，均经规定，以后即可循用。
    这画院的内容，将不同于一般学校，其实际的组织和工作，尚在慎重研讨中，大体或将采取我国固有的“书院”、“画院”制度，和近代现代的“学校”、“研究所”制度，参合融会而定。这当然是一种尝试，成功与否，尚待考验。因“书院”“画院”两种均有优点，但时代不同，不应硬性抄袭，而“学校”“研究所”二者，又与“画院”性质不尽适合，故斟酌损益，颇非易事。
    我国文化遗产，向极丰富，历年虽经种种损失，然遗传的仍复不少。所惜以往精品，往往为帝王贵族豪商所专有，致与一般群众，演成脱节，尤其绘画一项，几与群众分离。然爱美为人类天性，吾国由都市以至乡村，由装饰品以至日用品，几无处不有图画，且民间创造尤多特产，以至爱国文人因反抗反动统治而独创一宗，兄弟民族因保守土风而流传的技巧，又历代吸收了不少外来的营养，因此民族风格之内，实具有多种的血型。所惜多年为封建统治所掩蔽，披了他们的外衣，以致埋没了我国艺术的真精神，而且逐渐只存躯壳。尤其近三、五十年，国画界少人倡导扶持，成了无政府状态，间有一、二同志，亦只能孤芳自赏，不易振起颓风，转移运会，这自然不定是国画家的责任，但事实上趋向下坡，是不可讳言的。现在否极泰来，领导上对于国画的重视，已经发端，但究竟效果如何，恐怕仍如周扬同志所说，国画的前途，要由国画家努力。这个课题，颇属严重，我深盼国内画家，一致为此而努力，且为此而团结，尤其当此青黄不接之际，承先启后之责，寄在今日画家身上，所以责任尤重。
    说到“画院”的工作，大致当不出创作、研究、教课三者，但只此即不容易搞好，因为我国向无一部较完整的美术史或绘画史，前人著作记载，每多片段，难于提要，历代作品更多已毁失，虽然近日收回和新发现的不在少数，但要一一做有系统的说明，殊不容易。更有许多地方，不是用今天流行的语言意识，所易表达得恰好的。又有不少画家不习惯于使用语文，他的技巧和见解，只能口耳相传，或心领神会，所以国务院所提带徒弟的规定，是非常正确而切要的。当此百花齐放之际，在我们自己的园地上，应该令固有的万紫千红，更加放出异彩，这是我国的美术家的义务，也可说是大众的期望。从前我国人放弃自己对祖国的一切文化艺术义务，任令文化侵略的野心家，盗窃我国的美术财富，包办我国的美术业务，阻碍我国的美术活动，这实在是可耻的。今天，随着我们国际地位的增高，对全世界文化美术，我们亦负有提供促进之责，有不少的友邦人士，方渴望我们能提供一部分固有美术，以资效法，而我们却还缺少一切采集和整理，正如古语所说，日坐宝山而不知，这不但显示我们的空浮疏略，而且不久文化高潮继经济高潮到来的时候，我们仍拿不出什么东西来，无以供给人民的需要，这将是后悔无及的。今天政府此举，正是适合时宜，望我国画界老年、壮年、青年，一致奋起，共同前进。
