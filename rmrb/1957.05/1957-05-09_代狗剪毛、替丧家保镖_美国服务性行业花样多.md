    Dog Grooming, Bodyguards for Funeral Homes...Many Varieties in American Service Industries
    (This article) reports that according to the American "Newsweek," one of the fastest-growing sectors in the American economy is the service industry. This industry is filled with all kinds of occupations, from plant doctors who specialize in treating flowers and plants to "beauticians" who groom dogs, and new varieties are constantly emerging. For example, in Chicago, there is a "Star Detective Agency" that calls itself a "first-class funeral escort service." Its business is to protect the safety of mourners in cemeteries. In Los Angeles, a man named Oliver makes a lot of money running a traffic ticket company. The method is very simple: he simply stands in court and pays the fines for people who violate traffic regulations, charging one dollar per person. In Hollywood, there is a matchmaking "West Ester Travel Agency" that advertises: "Do you want to get married or divorced in Mexico? Let us arrange your trip."
    "Newsweek" says that these various industries "keep the consumer alive, out of jail, advise him, beautify him, entertain him, analyze his problems, heat, illuminate, paint, repair, wash, and fumigate his belongings, provide staff for his business, advertise, mimeograph, and organize it, making his life easier and more comfortable. At the same time, because he no longer does many odd jobs, he spends more money. And finally, they bury him."
    According to this magazine: since last December, the money spent by consumers on services alone has reached an annual rate of 100 billion US dollars, accounting for nearly two-fifths of all consumer spending. (Attached picture)

    代狗剪毛、替丧家保镖……
    美国服务性行业花样多
    本报讯　据美国“新闻周刊”报道，美国经济中增长得最快的一个部门是服务性行业。这个行业里从专替花草治病的植物医生到代剪狗毛的“美容师”，形形色色，五花八门，而且新花样不断出现。例如在芝加哥，有一家自称为“第一流的送葬护送服务社”的“明星侦探事务所”，它的业务是保护送葬人在坟场的安全。在洛杉矶，有一个叫奥利佛的人，他经营交通罚款公司的生意，大赚其钱，办法却非常简单，仅仅是站在法院替违反交通条例的人代付罚款，每人取费一美元。在好莱坞，有一家包办婚姻的“西埃斯特旅行社”，它登广告称：“你要在墨西哥结婚或离婚吗？让我们为你安排旅行。”
    “新闻周刊”说，这各式各样的行业“使消费者活着，不坐监牢，为他出主意，使他美化，给他娱乐，给他分析问题，给他的东西生热、发光、油漆、修理、洗涤和烘熏，为他的事业提供工作人员，为它宣传、油印、整理，使他的生活轻松舒适。同时由于使他不再干许许多多的零活，他花的钱要比较多。而最后，它们为他埋葬。”
    据这家杂志说：自从去年12月以来，仅仅是消费者在服务方面所花的钱，达到年率一千亿美元，占消费者全部花费的将近五分之二。（附图片）
