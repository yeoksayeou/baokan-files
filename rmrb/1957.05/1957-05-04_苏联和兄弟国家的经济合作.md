Economic Cooperation between the Soviet Union and Fraternal Countries
　　Huang Runting
Since socialism has transcended the confines of one country and become a world system, a new type of international economic relationship, unprecedented in history, has taken shape in the world. The economic cooperation between the Soviet Union and other socialist countries is a model of this type of economic relationship. Socialist countries share the political goal of striving for the realization of communism, the great friendship of proletarian internationalism, and the sincere desire to achieve common economic advancement. This is the fundamental reason for the continuous consolidation and vigorous development of economic cooperation between the Soviet Union and other socialist countries.

In the eleven years since the war, the economic cooperation between the Soviet Union and other socialist countries has not only expanded rapidly in scale but also become increasingly rich in content.

The Soviet Union's economic assistance to other socialist countries profoundly embodies the proletarian internationalist spirit of economic cooperation between the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. When the people's democratic countries faced various difficulties in the early days of liberation, the Soviet Union provided them with various forms of assistance to help them overcome temporary difficulties. In the years when the people's democratic countries were restoring their national economies and carrying out planned construction, the Soviet Union provided these countries with sincere and systematic assistance, greatly promoting the restoration of their national economies and the progress of socialist industrialization. By 1962, the Soviet Union will have helped other socialist countries build 462 factories and enterprises and 120 independent workshops and other technical equipment, of which 177 factories and enterprises and 62 independent workshops had been completed by the end of 1956. After the completion of these 391 enterprises and more than 90 workshops, the following products in these countries will have an increased annual output of at least: 5.4 million kilowatts of electricity, 9 million tons of steel, 65,000 tons of copper, 380,000 tons of nitrogen fertilizer, about 500,000 tons of caustic soda and soda ash, 4 million tons of petroleum products, 140,000 cars, and 50,000 tractors.

The Soviet Union also provides long-term loans to other socialist countries on preferential terms. As of February 1956, the total amount of loans reached 21 billion rubles. This is of considerable significance for them to solve construction funds and improve people's lives. In order to help other socialist countries build factories and train large numbers of technical personnel, the Soviet Union also sent more than 14,000 experts to these countries from 1947 to 1956; at the same time, it received nearly 10,000 experts from these countries for technical exchanges between each other. It is obvious that Soviet assistance has become one of the important conditions for the people's democratic countries to carry out socialist construction victoriously.

Recently, the Soviet Union has provided new and huge economic assistance to other socialist countries. When the Hungarian people were engaged in a difficult struggle against counter-revolution and were in urgent need of assistance, the Soviet people supplied them with a large amount of much-needed food and production raw materials; the Soviet government decided on March 28 to supply Hungary with commodities worth a total of 1.001 billion rubles this year, and grant a long-term low-interest loan of 750 million rubles. The Soviet Union decided to sell Poland 1.4 million tons of grain on credit this year and grant a long-term loan of 700 million rubles. In order to meet the needs of the people of the German Democratic Republic, the Soviet Union decided to lend 340 million rubles in free foreign exchange this year and greatly increase the supply of grain and industrial raw materials. The Soviet Union is supplying Romania with 450,000 tons of wheat on credit in the first half of this year and is providing technical assistance and equipment in the construction of chemical and petroleum industrial enterprises. The Soviet Union has also decided to grant Bulgaria a long-term loan of 200 million rubles and provide further technical assistance in economic construction. In the recent talks between the Soviet Union and Albania, the Soviet government decided to cancel two debts owed by Albania to the Soviet Union, totaling 422 million rubles. In addition, the Soviet Union will also provide Albania with the necessary technical assistance and equipment and machinery in the development of agriculture and industry. There is no doubt that these new aids will create more favorable conditions for the socialist construction cause and the improvement of people's lives in these countries.

Foreign trade is a major form of economic cooperation between the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. Through foreign trade, the Soviet Union and other socialist countries are carrying out close cooperation of mutual exchange. In 1956, the total value of Soviet foreign trade increased by 9% compared with 25 billion rubles in 1955, of which the value of foreign trade with other socialist countries accounted for more than 75%.

Through the channel of foreign trade, the Soviet Union exports to other socialist countries a large number of machines, equipment, metals, equipment, raw materials, medicines, daily necessities, and so on. The materials supplied by the Soviet Union to other socialist countries not only meet the requirements of these countries as much as possible in terms of time and quantity, but also are of the first class in quality; at the same time, among the materials supplied by the Soviet Union, there are many that these countries cannot buy or are difficult to buy from capitalist countries, but the Soviet Union supplies them. According to the needs of the Soviet Union and the possibility of its own exports, the people's democratic countries also supply the Soviet Union with many important materials. This large-scale exchange of materials powerfully supports the development of the construction cause of various countries and the continuous rise of people's lives. In order to support the economic development of other socialist countries, the Soviet Union always tries its best to accept the materials that these countries need to export.

At present, the Soviet Union has completed or is carrying out trade negotiations with other socialist countries for the year 1957. Throughout the trade negotiations, the Soviet government sincerely further implemented the spirit of its declaration issued on October 30 last year. This year, the trade volume of the Soviet Union with other socialist countries will increase by 13% compared with last year and 1.2 times compared with 1950; among them, the trade volume between the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia will increase by 11%, the trade volume between the Soviet Union and Germany will increase by 35%, the trade volume between the Soviet Union and Bulgaria will increase by 50%, and the trade volume between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia will be no less than 70 million US dollars. The trade between the Soviet Union and our country in 1957 will also develop in a planned way on a more solid foundation.

Scientific and technological cooperation between the Soviet Union and other socialist countries is an important sign of the new development of economic cooperation in the socialist camp. The Soviet Union has signed scientific and technological cooperation agreements with various people's democratic countries respectively. According to the provisions of the agreement, both parties are carrying out extremely extensive cooperation in science and technology. This scientific and technological cooperation, based on a solid and broad foundation, plays an extremely important role for socialist countries to solve technical problems in production and construction, rapidly improve their scientific and technological level, especially the practical application of new technologies.

It should be specially pointed out that in order to help other socialist countries develop the peaceful use of atomic energy, the Soviet Union concluded an agreement with Albania, Bulgaria, Hungary, the German Democratic Republic, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Mongolia, Poland, Romania, Czechoslovakia, and our country in March 1956 to establish the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, and transferred all the equipment, buildings, etc. of the Nuclear Problems Research Institute and the Electrophysical Laboratory of the Soviet Academy of Sciences to the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research for everyone to use. This sincere assistance from the Soviet Union makes it possible for other socialist countries to master the world's most advanced atomic energy science more quickly and serve their own socialist construction cause.

The increasingly close and consolidated economic cooperation between the Soviet Union and other socialist countries is also reflected in the coordinated development of the economies of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. In May last year, the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance of the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Germany, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and Albania held a regular meeting in Berlin, and representatives from our country and Yugoslavia participated in the meeting as observers. The meeting discussed and adopted the issues related to the mutual coordination of the development of the participating countries in the main sectors of the national economy in 1956-1960. This mutual coordination in economic development can not only enable countries to use their resources more fully and rationally and obtain assistance from fraternal countries, but also help further develop the economic cooperation of socialist countries.

The economic cooperation between the Soviet Union and other socialist countries is of extremely great significance for the economic development of socialist countries, for the consolidation of the socialist camp, and for striving for lasting world peace. This economic cooperation, based on equality, mutual benefit, and fraternal mutual assistance, cannot be shaken by any force; the "Declaration on the Basis of the Development and Further Strengthening of Friendship and Cooperation between the Soviet Union and Other Socialist Countries" issued by the Soviet government on October 30, 1956, has provided it with a more solid foundation for further development. It can be asserted that this economic cooperation will inevitably become increasingly consolidated and developed with the further economic upsurge of the socialist camp.

    苏联和兄弟国家的经济合作
    黄润庭
    自从社会主义超出一个国家范围变为世界体系以后，在世界上就形成一种史无前例的、新型的国际经济关系。苏联和其他社会主义国家的经济合作，便是这种经济关系的一个典范。社会主义各国之间有着为实现共产主义而奋斗的政治目标，有着无产阶级国际主义的伟大友谊，有着求得彼此经济共同高涨的真诚愿望。这就是苏联和其他社会主义国家经济合作不断巩固和蓬勃发展的根本原因。
    战后十一年多以来，苏联和其他社会主义国家的经济合作不仅在规模上迅速扩大了，而且在内容上也日益丰富了。
    苏联对其他社会主义国家的经济援助，最深刻地体现了苏联和其他社会主义国家经济合作的无产阶级国际主义精神。当各人民民主国家在解放初期面临各种困难的时候，苏联就给予它们各种援助，帮助它们渡过了暂时的困难。在各人民民主国家恢复国民经济和进行计划建设的年代里，苏联又向这些国家提供真诚的、系统的援助，大大地促进了这些国家国民经济的恢复和社会主义工业化的进展。到1962年，苏联将帮助其他社会主义国家建设起四百六十二项工厂企业和一百二十个单独车间与其他技术装备，其中的一百七十七项工厂企业和六十二个单独车间到1956年底已全部建成。其中三百九十一个企业和九十多个车间建成后，这些国家的下列产品每年至少增加的产量将是：电力五百四十万瓩，钢九百万吨，铜六万五千吨，氮肥三十八万吨，烧碱和纯碱约五十万吨，石油产品四百万吨，汽车十四万辆，拖拉机五万台。
    苏联还以优惠的条件对其他社会主义国家提供长期贷款。截至1956年2月，贷款总额均达二百一十亿卢布。这对于它们解决建设资金和改善人民生活，有相当重要的意义。苏联为了帮助其他社会主义国家建设工厂和大批培养技术人才，从1947年到1956年还向这些国家派出一万四千多名专家；同时接待了来自这些国家的将近一万名专家，进行相互之间的技术交流。十分明显，苏联的援助已经成为各人民民主国家胜利地进行社会主义建设事业的重要条件之一。
    最近，苏联对其他社会主义国家又提供了新的巨大的经济援助。当匈牙利人民同反革命作艰巨斗争而迫切需要援助的时候，苏联人民大量地供应了他们急需的食用物资和生产原料；苏联政府在3月28日又决定今年将供应匈牙利总值达十亿零一千万卢布的商品，贷予七亿五千万卢布的长期低利贷款。苏联决定在今年赊卖给波兰一百四十万吨谷物，并给予七亿卢布的长期贷款。为了满足德意志民主共和国人民的需要，苏联决定在今年内贷给三亿四千万卢布的自由外汇，并大量增加粮食和工业原料的供应。苏联在今年上半年以赊卖方式供应罗马尼亚四十五万吨小麦，并在建设化学和石油的工业企业方面给予技术援助和供应设备。苏联又决定给予保加利亚两亿卢布的长期贷款，并在经济建设上予以进一步的技术援助。在最近举行的苏联和阿尔巴尼亚会谈中，苏联政府决定取消阿尔巴尼亚欠苏联的两项债务，总额共达四亿二千二百万卢布。此外，苏联还要给阿尔巴尼亚在发展农业和工业以必要的技术援助和装备及机器。毫无疑问，这些新的援助必将为这些国家的社会主义建设事业和人民生活的改善，创设更有利的条件。
    对外贸易是苏联和其他社会主义国家经济合作的一个主要形式。通过对外贸易，苏联和其他社会主义国家进行着互通有无的密切合作。1956年苏联对外贸易总额比1955年的二百五十亿卢布增长9％，其中同其他社会主义国家的对外贸易额约占75％以上。
    苏联经由对外贸易这一渠道，向其他社会主义国家输出大量的机器、设备、金属、器材、原料、医药、生活必需品等等。苏联供应其他社会主义国家的物资，不仅在时间上、数量上尽量满足这些国家的要求，而且在质量上也是头等的；同时，在苏联所供应的物资中，有许多是这些国家从资本主义国家买不到或难以买到的，而苏联却予以供应。各人民民主国家根据苏联的需要和本国的输出可能，也供应苏联许多重要物资。这种大规模的物资交流，有力地支持各国建设事业的发展和人民生活的不断上升。苏联为了支援其他社会主义国家的经济发展，对于这些国家需要出口的物资总是尽量地接受。
    目前，苏联已经完成或正在进行同其他社会主义国家1957年度的贸易谈判。在整个贸易谈判中，苏联政府真诚地进一步贯彻执行了它在去年10月30日发表的宣言的精神。苏联今年同其他社会主义国家的贸易额将比去年增长13％，比1950年增长一点二倍；其中苏捷两国贸易额将增长11％、苏德两国贸易额将增长35％、苏保两国贸易额将增长50％、苏南两国贸易额将不少于七千万美元。苏联和我国1957年度的贸易也将在更加巩固的基础上有计划地发展。
    苏联和其他社会主义国家的科学技术合作是社会主义阵营经济合作新发展的重要标志。苏联已分别同各人民民主国家签订了科学技术合作协定。根据协定规定，双方在科学与技术方面进行着极广泛的合作。这种建立在稳固而又广泛的基础上的科学技术合作，对于社会主义各国解决生产建设中的技术问题，迅速地提高科学技术水平，特别是新技术的实际运用，起着极重要的作用。
    应当特别提出，苏联为了帮助其他社会主义国家发展和平利用原子能事业，在1956年3月同阿尔巴尼亚、保加利亚、匈牙利、德意志民主共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、蒙古、波兰、罗马尼亚、捷克斯洛伐克以及我国缔结了成立联合核子研究所的协定，并将苏联科学院的核子问题研究所和电气物理实验室的一切设备、建筑等移交联合核子研究所供大家使用。苏联这种真诚的援助，使得其他社会主义国家将有可能更快地掌握世界上最先进的原子能科学，来为本国的社会主义建设事业服务。
    苏联和其他社会主义国家经济合作的日益密切和巩固，还体现在苏联和其他社会主义国家的经济的协同发展。去年5月间，苏、波、捷、德、匈、罗、保、阿等八国经济互助委员会在柏林举行了常会，我国和南斯拉夫的代表以观察员的身份参加了这次会议。会议讨论并通过了有关与会各国1956—1960年在国民经济各主要部门发展上的相互配合问题。这种经济发展上的相互配合，不仅可以使各国更充分更合理地使用自己的资源和从兄弟国家得到援助，而且有助于进一步发展社会主义国家的经济合作。
    苏联和其他社会主义国家的经济合作，对于社会主义各国的经济发展，对于社会主义阵营的巩固和争取世界持久和平，都有极其伟大的意义。这种建立在平等互利和兄弟互助的基础上的经济合作，是任何力量所不可能动摇的；苏联政府1956年10月30日发表的“关于发展和进一步加强苏联同其他社会主义国家的友谊和合作的基础的宣言”，又为它提供了进一步发展的更巩固的基础。可以断言，这种经济合作必将随着社会主义阵营经济的进一步高涨而日益巩固和发展。
