    Don't Confuse the Children	　Wu Jingyu
    When children first carry their schoolbags to school, parents always solemnly instruct them: Listen carefully to the teacher. Because of this habitual teaching, children gradually form a concept: Listening to the teacher is a matter of course. Parents are also happy that their children can listen to the teacher. Because this is a concrete manifestation of the child's ability to listen to the parents' teachings. However, at present, with many primary and secondary school graduates unable to continue their studies, some parents hold incorrect attitudes towards their children's schooling and employment. Not only do they not cooperate with school teachers in conducting labor and production education for their children, and cultivating their children's noble qualities of loving labor and loving working people, but they also educate their children through various means to doubt the school's education.
    I recently read a letter from a state worker to his daughter, which said: "You should do everything possible to try to get into junior high school this year. Otherwise, the whole family will be sad for you. You said that your teacher said that even if you can't go to school, you still have a future. You can learn technology to participate in industrial construction, or return to the agricultural cooperative to learn from the examples of Xu Jianchun and Feng Jian. You should know that your conditions are not suitable in all aspects. You should know how many elementary school graduates in the country can be like Xu Jianchun." Such a letter is undoubtedly educating children not to believe the teacher's words. How can this not make those innocent children feel confused?
   "Hoping one's son becomes a dragon" is originally a great wish of being a parent; "Peach and plum filling the world" is also the greatest honor felt by every teacher. In order to truly teach children well, parents and teachers must cooperate consistently to carry out positive education.
    Today, the Party and the government have repeatedly called on us to correctly guide students' further education and employment. Every teacher and parent should educate children to be able to see their future clearly, obey the needs of the motherland, and thus stride towards a new life with confidence. If everyone is like the parent mentioned above, only one-sidedly encouraging children to continue their studies, it will undermine the effectiveness of school education and have a negative impact on children's ideological education. This situation deserves the common attention of parents and should be corrected.

### 不要让孩子们惶惑

    不要让孩子们惶惑	　吴靖宇
    当孩子们第一次背上书包上学的时候，父母总是要郑重地叮嘱一番：好好地听老师的话。由于这种习惯性的教导，孩子们逐渐形成了一种观念：听老师的话是一件天经地义的事情。家长也为孩子能听老师的话而喜悦。因为这是孩子能听从父母的教导的一种具体表现。然而，在目前有许多中小学毕业生不能升学的情况下，有些家长对待子女升学和就业问题抱着不正确的态度，他们不但不配合学校教师向子女进行劳动生产教育，培养子女热爱劳动，热爱劳动人民的高尚品质，反而通过各种方式教育自己的子女来怀疑学校的教育。
    我最近读到一个国家工作人员写给他女儿的信，信中说：“你应该尽一切力量争取今年考上初中。不然，全家人也都会为你难过。你说你们老师说过，不能升学也有前途，可以学习技术参加工业建设，或者回到农业社学习徐建春、冯健的榜样。你应该知道，你各方面的条件都不适合。要知道全国有几个高小毕业生能像徐建春那样。”这样的信，无疑地是在教育子女不要相信老师的话，这怎能不叫那些无邪的孩子们感到惶惑呢？
   “望子成龙”本来是做父母的一大心愿；“桃李满天下”又何尝不是每个教师感到最大的荣誉。为了能够真正的教好孩子们，家长和教师必须是协同一致的来进行正面教育。
    今天，党和政府一再号召我们应该正确地指导学生的升学和就业。每个教师和家长都应该教育孩子们能够看清自己的前途，服从祖国的需要，从而满怀信心地走向新生活。如果都像上面提到的那位家长一样，只片面的鼓励子女升学，就会破坏学校教育的效果，对子女的思想教育起着不好的影响。这种情况是值得家长们共同注意并且加以纠正的。
