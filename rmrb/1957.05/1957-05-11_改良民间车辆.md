    Improving Civilian Vehicles
            Zhu Tian Shun, Deputy Director of the Highway Bureau, Ministry of Communications
    It is said that vehicles existed in our country more than two thousand years ago. The Zhou Dynasty had vehicle types such as Lu, Rong, Yu, and Nian; during the Qin and Han dynasties, there were even beautifully decorated vehicles such as "Wenliang" and "Zi?". The tale of Zhuge Liang creating "wooden oxen and flowing horses" is still widely circulated among the people. Although our country now has various modern means of transportation, there are still approximately ten million human-powered vehicles and five million animal-powered vehicles in the vast countryside. These vehicles, inherited from our great ancestors, represent a tremendous social transportation force. The broad masses of peasants rely on them for agricultural production, they relied on them to support the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation; and after liberation, they relied on them to support national economic construction. In recent years, approximately 80% of the freight volume and 40% of the turnover volume in highway transportation have been carried out by civilian vehicles. Due to the shortage of automobiles in our country, they will remain an important auxiliary force on the transportation front for a considerable period to come.
    Although civilian vehicles in our country have a long history, the vast majority of civilian vehicles still suffer from shortcomings such as heavy bodies, low payloads, high rolling resistance, high road damage, inflexible steering, and unsafe uphill and downhill performance, due to the long-term poverty of the broad masses of people and the lack of resources to make technical improvements to vehicle construction. For example, the old three-wheeled oxcarts in northern Jiangsu weigh 677 kilograms and require a pulling force of 68-78 kilograms or more on a flat road when empty; the four-wheeled oxcarts in Henan and other places sink about 4 centimeters into the field when driving empty, requiring a pulling force of 182 kilograms. According to a survey of twenty-two agricultural production cooperatives in Anhui Province in 1955, more than one hundred livestock casualties occurred due to the lack of braking equipment on vehicles. Precisely because of these limitations, the use of rural vehicles has significant constraints. For example, when participating in sideline transportation, the freight rate per ton-kilometer is generally around 5 jiao, more than double the automobile freight rate. Therefore, how to fully utilize civilian vehicles while gradually carrying out technical improvements, increasing their carrying capacity and driving speed, reducing transportation costs, and ensuring transportation safety has become an issue that needs attention.
    Most of the existing civilian vehicles are used for agriculture, with a small portion engaged in professional transportation; during the agricultural off-season, vehicles used for agriculture also engage in sideline transportation, undertaking short-distance transportation tasks. This not only makes up for the shortage of national transportation capacity, but also increases the sideline income of agricultural production cooperatives. For example, in 1956, agricultural production cooperatives' vehicles organized by highway transportation departments completed approximately 435.5 million ton-kilometers of transportation tasks, equivalent to increasing the national transportation capacity by 7,800 automobiles; at the same time, it also increased the sideline income of agricultural cooperatives by approximately 200 million yuan. Therefore, the technical improvement of civilian vehicles should first consider the needs of agriculture, the adaptability of vehicles to rural roads and loose soil areas; and also consider the needs of farmers participating in sideline transportation and professional transportation.
    At present, most agricultural production cooperatives and transportation cooperatives in our country have a short history and limited capital accumulation, and it is not yet possible to add many means of transportation. To complete the ever-increasing farmland transportation and highway transportation tasks, it is necessary to start with fully exploiting the potential of existing civilian vehicles. Therefore, the current technical improvement policy for civilian vehicles should first focus on improving existing vehicles in situ, and then design and manufacture new vehicles. Whether it is improving old vehicles or designing and manufacturing new vehicles, the possibility of the financial burden of agricultural production cooperatives and transportation cooperatives must also be considered.
    The industrial level of our country is still very low, and the technical improvement of civilian vehicles should consider the possibility of material resources. For example, although replacing the wooden journal bearings of human-powered vehicles with ball bearings can reduce the pulling force by 45%, it would be difficult to obtain enough ball bearings if all human-powered and animal-powered vehicles adopted this method of improvement. Similarly, although pneumatic rubber tires have lower pulling force and lower rolling resistance than iron-wood wheels, it would also be difficult to replace all human-powered and animal-powered vehicles with pneumatic rubber tires.
    Based on the above situation and the results of repeated comparative tests, the current technical improvement of existing vehicles should focus on the axles and wheels, to reduce the frictional resistance inside (between the wheel and the axle) and outside (between the wheel and the ground) the wheels, strengthen the sliding performance of the vehicles, increase the carrying capacity of the vehicles, and reduce damage to the roads.
    In terms of axles, if the wooden axle does not have iron sleeves or iron keys, iron sleeves and iron keys can be added. For example, after improving wooden-axle human-powered vehicles using this method, the pulling force can be reduced by 22%, and the improvement cost is only about 2 yuan. Vehicles with fixed axles can be converted to rotating axles to enhance steering flexibility. A small number of professional transportation vehicles can also be converted to iron axles with iron sleeves and ball bearings.
    In terms of wheels, iron-wood wheel vehicles can be converted to solid rubber wheels according to the condition of the vehicle, that is, the original iron rim is removed and replaced with a grooved reverse rim, nailed to the rim, and then fitted with solid rubber tires (using old and waste tires). For example, the pulling force of an animal-powered vehicle with iron-wood wheels carrying 500 kilograms on a dirt road is originally 47 kilograms, but after being improved using this method, the load can reach 735 kilograms, and the pulling force on the same road is only 25 kilograms. Vehicles improved in this way can not only be driven on rural roads, but also on highways. The improvement cost is only about 70 yuan. Some professional transportation or frequently participating sideline transportation iron-wood wheel animal-powered vehicles can be improved to pneumatic rubber tires with wooden axles and wooden wheel webs. After this improvement, the load capacity can be increased from 500 kilograms to 1,500 kilograms, and the pulling force can also be reduced from 47 kilograms to 45 kilograms, and it saves more than 200 kilograms of steel compared to retrofitting iron axle ball bearing pneumatic tires. Two-wheeled professional carriages can also be gradually converted into four-wheeled carriages to increase carrying capacity.
    While improving the rolling performance of vehicles, braking equipment should also be installed to ensure transportation safety. The braking equipment should meet the requirements of simple structure, convenient installation, low cost, and good braking performance as much as possible. For example, the installation of caliper braking equipment on pneumatic rubber-tired wheelbarrows has shown good braking performance on 20% slopes when carrying a load of 300 kilograms, and the installation cost is only 12 yuan; the installation of braking equipment with wooden stick braking steel rings on pneumatic rubber-tired two-wheeled human-powered or animal-powered vehicles shows good braking performance on 12% slopes when carrying a load of 1,500 kilograms, and the installation cost is only 15 yuan.
    Since the body structure of civilian vehicles is simple and all wood, there is no need to make many changes when improving the vehicle in situ. However, when newly manufactured, it should be improved according to the requirements of the type of goods to be transported. For example, Shenyang City once changed the fixed carriage to a hinged carriage, where the carriage boards can be erected to load loose bulk goods such as sand, stones, and coal; the carriage boards can be folded to transport packages and long goods; and the bottom of the carriage has shallow grooves, so bricks and tiles can be loaded without using ropes.
    In addition to using the above methods for on-site improvement, it is also necessary to design and manufacture several new civilian vehicles as a direction for further improvement. In water network areas and mountainous areas, after testing, a passenger and freight vehicle with a track width that can be wide or narrow, and can be pulled by mules, horses, cattle, and donkeys, can be gradually promoted with the improvement of road conditions, to reduce manual carrying and transporting. Since four-wheeled carriages are more stable and steadier than two-wheeled carriages, generally saving about 40% of livestock pulling power; therefore, in the professional carriage transportation industry or agricultural production cooperatives with more transportation tasks, some four-wheeled carriages should be gradually added. In the future, with the continuous increase in the number of rural tractors, consideration can also be given to gradually adding some dual-purpose vehicles that are both suitable for livestock traction and can be towed by tractors (or automobiles).
    The technical improvement of civilian vehicles will be an important reform of transportation tools in the vast rural areas of our country. If carried out well, it will greatly improve agricultural production efficiency and promote the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. If conservatively estimated, gradually converting 10% of the existing iron-wood wheel vehicles into solid rubber wheel vehicles would increase transportation efficiency within a year by the equivalent of adding 25,000 three-ton automobiles. However, changing the habits of using vehicles that the broad masses of farmers have had for thousands of years is not an easy task. It is not simply an economic task, but also an arduous mass work. Therefore, to do this work well, we must vigorously publicize, carry out pilot projects, and gradually promote it. At the same time, it is hoped that the transportation, agriculture, handicrafts, commerce, supply and marketing cooperatives, and other departments in various places will cooperate closely, and under the leadership of the local party committees and governments, mobilize and help the horse-drawn cart transportation cooperatives and larger agricultural production cooperatives to first improve some old vehicles and add some new vehicles. After making achievements, gradually publicize and promote them to nearby farmers.

    改良民间车辆
            交通部公路总局副局长　朱田顺
    相传两千多年前，我国就有了车辆。周朝有所谓路、戎、舆、辇等车种；秦汉时期，更有所谓“輼輬”、“輜?”等装饰美丽的车辆。诸葛亮造“木牛、流马”的佳话，至今仍在民间传诵着。现在我国虽然已经有了各种近代化的运输工具，但是，在广大农村中，仍然有约一千多万辆人力车和五百多万辆兽力车。我们伟大的祖先给我们遗留下来的这些车辆，是一支巨大的社会运输力量。广大农民依靠它们进行农业生产，依靠它们支援过抗日战争和解放战争；解放以后，又依靠它们支援过国家经济建设。几年来，在公路运输中，大约有80％左右的运量和40％左右的周转量，是依靠民间车辆担任的。由于我国汽车不足，在今后相当长的时期内，它们仍将是运输战线上一支重要的辅助力量。
    我国民间车辆虽然历史悠久，但是，长期以来，由于广大人民生活贫困，没有力量进行车辆构造技术的改造。因此，目前绝大多数的民间车辆仍然存在着车身重、载重低、滚动阻力大、对道路的破坏性大、转向不灵活、上下坡不安全等缺点。如苏北一带旧有的三轮牛车，车身自重六百七十七公斤，平路空车拉力六十八——七十八公斤以上；河南等地的四轮牛车，空车在田野行驶，车轮即陷入约四公分，拉力一百八十二公斤。据安徽省1955年二十二个农业生产合作社的调查，因车辆无制动设备，曾发生一百多头牲口的伤亡事故。正由于这些条件的限制，农村车辆在使用上就有很大的局限性。如参加副业运输时，每一吨公里运价，一般高达五角左右，比汽车运价多一倍以上。因此，如何在充分利用民间车辆的同时，逐步进行技术改良，提高它们的载重能力和行驶速度，降低运输成本，保证运输安全，就成为当前需要引起注意的问题。
    现有民间车辆除小部分从事专业运输外，绝大部分用于农业；农闲季节，用于农业的车辆，也从事副业运输，担负短距离的运输任务。这不但可以弥补国家运力的不足，也可以增加农业生产合作社的副业收入。譬如，在1956年中，经公路运输部门组织的农业生产合作社的车辆，约完成四亿三千五百余万吨公里的运输任务，等于为国家增加了七千八百辆汽车的运力；同时，也为农业合作社增加了约两亿元的副业收入。因此，民间车辆的技术改良应当首先考虑到农业的需要，考虑到车辆在农村道路和松土地带行驶的适应性；同时也要考虑到农民参加副业运输以及专业运输的需要。
    目前我国大多数农业生产合作社和运输合作社的历史较短，资金积累不多，还不可能添置很多的运输工具。要完成不断增长的农田运输和公路运输任务，必须从充分发挥现有民间车辆的潜力着手。因此，目前民间车辆的技术改良方针，首先应该是对旧有车辆的就车改良，然后才是设计制造新式车辆。无论就旧车改良或设计制造新式车辆，也都要考虑到农业生产合作社和运输合作社财力负担的可能性。
    目前我国的工业水平还很低，民间车辆的技术改良应该考虑到物质资源的可能性。譬如把人力车辆的木耳轴承改为滚珠轴承，虽然可以降低拉力45％；但是，若一般人、兽力车都采用这种方法改良，滚珠来源是有困难的。同样，汽胶轮虽然比铁木轮拉力低，滚动阻力小，但是，若一般人、兽力车都换装汽胶胎，也是有困难的。
    根据上述情况和反复对比试验的结果，目前就原车进行技术改良时，应着重在车轴和车轮方面，以减轻车轮内部（车轮与车轴间）和外部（车轮与地面间）的摩擦阻力，加强车辆的滑动性能，提高车辆载重量，减轻对道路的破坏。
    在车轴方面，若是木轴未镶有铁套、铁键的，可加装铁套、铁键。如木轴人力车用这种方法改良后，可以降低22％的拉力，改良所需费用仅二元左右。连轴转的车辆，可以改为绕轴转，以加强转向的灵活性。少数专业运输车辆，也可以改为铁轴铁套和滚珠轴承。
    在车轮方面，铁木轮车可根据车辆状况改为硬胶轮，就是把原来铁瓦轮缘拆下改为槽式反瓦，钉在轮缘上，再加装硬胶皮（利用旧废胎）。如载重五百公斤的铁木轮的兽力车在土路行驶，原来拉力四十七公斤，用这种方法改良以后，载重可达七百三十五公斤，而在同样道路上，拉力仅为二十五公斤。这样改良过的车辆，不仅可以在乡村道路行驶，也可以在公路上通行。改良费仅需七十元左右。有些专业运输的或经常参加副业运输的铁木轮兽力车，可以改良为木轴木质轮网的汽胶轮。这样改良后，载重量可以由五百公斤提高到一千五百公斤，拉力亦由四十七公斤减为四十五公斤，而且比改装铁轴滚珠轴承汽胶胎节省钢材二百余公斤。两轮的专业马车，也可以逐步改为四轮马车，以提高载重能力。
    在提高车辆滚动性能的同时，还应安装制动设备，以保证运输安全。制动设备要尽量符合结构简单、安装方便、造价低廉、制动良好的要求。如在汽胶轮独轮人力车上安装钳式制动设备，经试验载重三百公斤时，在20％的坡道上制动效果良好，安装费只十二元；在汽胶轮双轮人力车或兽力车上安装木棍制动钢圈的制动设备，载重一千五百公斤在12％的坡道上，制动效果良好，安装费只十五元。
    由于民间车辆的车身结构简单，又都是木结构，在就车改良时，不必多加变动。但在新制时，应按照所运货种的要求加以改进。如沈阳市就曾经把固定车厢改为活页车厢，厢板竖起可装载砂、石、煤等散积货物；厢板折合可装运包件及长大货物；厢底板有浅槽，可以不用绳捆装载砖瓦。
    除了用上述各种方法进行就车改良外，也还需要设计和制造几种新式民间车辆，以作为进一步改良的方向。在水网地区和山区，经过试验，可以随着道路情况的改善，逐步推广一种车辕能宽能窄，骡、马、牛、驴都可牵引的客、货两用车，以减少肩挑人背运输。由于四轮马车比双轮马车载货平稳，车体稳定，一般可节省牲畜挽力40％左右；因此，在专业马车运输业或运输任务较多的农业生产合作社中，应逐步添置一些四轮马车。将来随着农村拖拉机数量的不断增加，也可以考虑逐步添置一些既适合牲畜牵引，又可以用拖拉机（或汽车）拖带的两用车。
    民间车辆的技术改良，将是我国广大农村交通工具的一项重要改革，进行得好的话，它将大大提高农业生产效率，促进城乡物资交流。如从低估计，将现有10％的铁木轮车逐步改装为硬胶轮车，在一年内所提高的运输效率，约等于增加二万五千辆三吨汽车。但是要改变广大农民千百年来使用车辆的习惯，并不是一件轻而易举的事情。它不单纯是一件经济工作，而且是一件艰巨的群众工作。因此，要想作好这一工作，必须大力宣传、典型试办、逐步推广。同时希望各地交通、农业、手工业、商业、供销合作社等部门通力合作，在当地党委和政府的领导下，动员和帮助马车运输合作社和较大农业生产合作社首先改良一部分旧车并增添一些新式车辆，待做出成绩后，再逐步向附近农民宣传和推广。
