Things That Spoil the Scenery

    In Jiangshan County, Zhejiang Province, south of the county seat, stands Tiger Mountain. It is the only scenic spot in Jiangshan County with beautiful scenery and numerous historical sites. According to the current urban construction plan of the local People's Government, a people's park and a stadium will be built in the Tiger Mountain area.
    However, since July 1956, the West Zhejiang Farm has arbitrarily quarried stone on Tiger Mountain, a scenic area, causing serious damage to the beautiful scenery. Now, the "Lion" crouching on the west side of Tiger Mountain has had half of its head chopped off, its face is unrecognizable, and its body is covered with wounds. The "Flying Stone" and "Ancient Smoke Locker Cave" on the mountain were originally popular places for tourists to rest and escape the summer heat, but now, due to blasting and excavation, the foundation stone of the "Flying Stone" has been broken and is in danger of collapsing; the "Ancient Smoke Locker Cave" is filled with rocks, and the large rock on the top of the cave may collapse. The local people are deeply dissatisfied with this situation, and the Jiangshan County People's Congress has also received many opinions on this issue.
    After learning about the above situation in August 1956, the Jiangshan County People's Committee sent personnel to the site for inspection and repeatedly raised opinions and criticisms to the West Zhejiang Farm. However, Huang Hai, the head of the West Zhejiang Farm, although repeatedly expressed verbally that he accepted the opinions of the local government, continued to carry out mining work. The Zhejiang Provincial People's Committee and its competent department, the Zhejiang Provincial Public Security Department, instructed them to immediately comply with the opinions of the Jiangshan County People's Committee and stop mining on Tiger Mountain, but the farm still refused to implement it.
    We believe that it is a good thing for the West Zhejiang Farm to develop lime production in order to increase the farm's economic income and meet market needs. However, there is a lot of limestone available for mining in Jiangshan County, which can fully meet the planned production volume of the farm. In order to be convenient, they do not go to other places to mine, and they do not hesitate to destroy such good scenic spots and historical sites, and disregard the opinions of the government and the people. This is a wrong behavior. Therefore, we make the following suggestions to the West Zhejiang Farm and relevant leaders: We demand that the West Zhejiang Farm must immediately stop mining in the scenic area of ​​Tiger Mountain, and appropriately repair and compensate for the damaged scenery.

    煞风景的事情
    在浙江省江山县城南，矗立着一座老虎山。它是江山县城唯一的风景优美、名胜古迹繁多的胜地。根据目前当地人民政府的城镇建设规划，在老虎山一带将修建人民公园和体育场。
    可是从1956年7月起，浙西农场却擅自在老虎山风景区开山采石，使优美的风景区遭到严重的破坏。现在，蜷伏在老虎山西面的“雄狮”，头部已被斫掉一半，面目不见了，狮身满是鳞伤。山上的 “飞来石”与“古烟箩洞”原是游人休憩和避暑的胜地，现在因爆破、开凿，使“飞来石”的基石破碎，有倾倒的危险；在“古烟箩洞”内堆满了乱石，洞顶的大岩石可能会坍下。当地人民群众对这情况深表不满，江山县人民代表大会也收到不少有关这一问题的意见。
    江山县人民委员会于1956年8月了解以上情况后，曾派员前去现场检查，一再对浙西农场提出意见和批评。而浙西农场场长黄海，虽是一再在口头上表示接受当地政府的意见，可是却一直继续进行开采工作。浙江省人民委员会及其主管部门浙江省公安厅指示他们立即遵照江山县人民委员会的意见，停止对老虎山的开采，该农场仍不执行。
    我们认为：浙西农场为了增加农场经济收入，并满足市场需要，开展石灰生产，这是好事。但在江山县可供开采的石灰岩很多，完全可以满足该场计划生产量的需要，他们为了贪图便利，不到别地去开采，竟不惜破坏这样好的名胜古迹，而且漠视政府和人民群众的意见，这是一种错误的行为。为此，我们对浙西农场及有关领导方面提出建议：要求浙西农场必须立即停止在老虎山风景区的开采，对已遭破坏的风景，酌情加以修葺弥补。
