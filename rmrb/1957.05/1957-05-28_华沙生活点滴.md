Glimpses of Life in Warsaw

    A Chill in Spring
    May is supposed to be the height of spring. However, on the streets of Warsaw, one sees many people wearing thick woolen coats. A cartoon in a magazine shows a couple shivering with cold on a park bench. According to the weather forecast, this cold and gloomy weather will continue until the end of May. In mid-May, the temperature even dropped to zero degrees.
    Warsaw newspapers reported that in the southern resort area of Zakopane, the temperature was minus six degrees, and the snow on the nearby mountain peaks was seventy centimeters deep.
          Book and Newspaper Festival Opens
    Sunday, May 5th, the Ujazdowskie Avenue in Warsaw was lined with book stalls. The annual Book and Newspaper Festival opened. As usual, the festival sells books on various subjects, and writers meet with readers. Many famous Polish writers signed autographs for readers. On this day, books worth 300,000 zlotys were sold.
    On this day, airplanes scattered colorful leaflets all over the sky. The leaflets offered prizes, the highest being seventy-five zlotys, which could be used to purchase books.
    In addition, there was a special kiosk for the blind, selling textbooks for the blind published by the Polish Association for the Blind.
    The Book and Newspaper Festival will last for several weeks.
        Savings Accounts with a Special Purpose
    The Warsaw Savings Bank recently introduced a new type of savings account to encourage private investment in housing construction. The savings accounts are divided into three types according to the area of the house to be built: fifty square meters, eighty-five square meters, or more than eighty-five square meters.
    If you want a private house with an area of fifty square meters, you must deposit 18,000 zlotys into this savings account within thirty-eight months. The state will then lend you 100,000 zlotys when you start building your private house. The homeowner will repay the state this 100,000 zlotys within twenty to twenty-five years.
          New Television Sets
    So far, Poland only has one type of domestically produced television set, the "Wisła." But soon, new "Belweder" and "Wawel" television sets will be available. The advantage of the new brand of television sets is that moving from one city to another does not affect reception, and you can watch programs from television stations in various Polish cities. By the end of this year, 5,000 "Belweder" television sets will be produced to meet market demand.
      Overseas Chinese Children Learning Chinese
    Overseas Chinese children in Warsaw have officially started learning their mother tongue for several months. Twice a week, they study Chinese under the guidance of a Chinese female teacher. This is a special mixed class, with the youngest student being five years old and the oldest being twenty-three years old. This class was opened at the request of the Overseas Chinese.
    Before this, these Overseas Chinese children only knew Polish. Now, they can conduct simple conversations in their mother tongue.

    华沙生活点滴
    春天里的寒意
    5月本是春意正浓的月份。可是华沙街头穿着厚呢大衣的行人触目皆是。杂志上登着一幅幽默画，一对情人在公园的长凳上冻得索索发抖。据气象台预报，这种阴冷气候要延续到5月底，5月中旬温度甚至降到零度。
    华沙报纸上说，在南部的休养区查库邦尼温度为零下六度，附近山顶积雪七十公分。
          书报节开幕
    5月5日是星期日，华沙乌雅兹道夫斯基街上书摊林立。一年一度的书报节开幕了。按照惯例，在这个节日里，出售各种题材的书籍，作家和读者见面。许多波兰著名的作家应读者之请签名留念。这一天共售出价值三十万兹罗提的书籍。
    这一天，飞机散布的各色传单满天飞翔。传单上有奖，最高的是七十五兹罗提，可以凭此购书。
    此外，专门设有盲人书报亭，出售波兰盲人协会的供盲人阅读的教材。
    书报节要延续好几个星期。
        别有用途的存折
    华沙储蓄处最近开办了一种新的存折，目的是鼓励私人投资建筑住宅。存折按将要建筑的住宅面积分三种：五十平方公尺，八十五平方公尺或八十五平方公尺以上。
    如果你想有一所五十平方公尺面积的私人住宅，那么你就要在三十八个月内在这存折内存入一万八千兹罗提，国家就会在你开始建造私人住宅时贷给你十万兹罗提。这十万兹罗提由房主人在二十年到二十五年内归还国家。
          新的电视机
    到目前为止，波兰只有一种“维斯拉”牌的国产电视机。但不久，一种新的“贝尔维德累”和“瓦维尔”牌的电视机即将问世。新牌号的电视机的优点在于：从一个城市搬到另一个城市不影响收看，可以看到波兰各个城市的电视台的节目。到今年年底，将有五千架“贝尔维德累”牌电视机生产出来供应市场的需要。
      华侨子弟学中文
    在华沙的华侨子弟正式开始学习祖国语文已经几个月了。每星期两次，他们在一位中国女教师的指导下学习中文。这是一个特殊的混合班，最小的学员是五岁，最大的二十三岁。这个班是应华侨的请求开设的。
    在这以前，这些华侨子弟只会波兰文。现在，他们已能用祖国语言进行简单的会话。
