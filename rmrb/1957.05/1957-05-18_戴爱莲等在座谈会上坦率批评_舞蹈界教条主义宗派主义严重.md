Beijing News: At two symposia on internal contradictions in the capital's dance circles on the 15th and 17th, participants revealed a lack of respect for the artistic views and creative labor of Chinese dance experts, as well as the lax leadership and sectarian sentiments within the Chinese Dance Art Research Association.

At the meeting, Dai Ailian spoke about the great development of China's dance cause in recent years, but as a dance worker, she has been serving the needs of the revolution by undertaking administrative work, completing foreign missions, and participating in social activities. But in dance art? She said, "I feel more and more that my ability is declining. In the past eight years, I have had very few opportunities for artistic practice." She recalled that before liberation, in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, although the conditions were poor and life was difficult, she still taught some students and did some creation; today the environment is better, and the difficulties are less, but the creation is much less. Originally an overseas Chinese, she wanted to express her love for the motherland through her dance work. She had created works such as "Selling" and "Guerrilla Story" and also worked hard to learn the folk dances of the Yao, Tibetan, and Uyghur ethnic groups. She believed that these were not in contradiction with the Party's policies; however, after the dance drama "Peace Dove" was performed, it was criticized by dogmatists and labeled with the hat of worshipping Western, bourgeois literary thought; it seemed that everything in the past was useless, and everything needed to be learned from scratch.

Dai Ailian was formerly the deputy head of the Central Song and Dance Troupe, and is now the head of the Central Experimental Opera Theater Dance Troupe and the principal of the Beijing Dance School. Talking about cooperation with party members, she said: "I can only listen to them, and my opinions are not valued." She wanted to stage the dance drama "Luo Shengjiao" in the dance troupe, but because the actors were unwilling and the leadership did not support it, it was stopped. Her desire to nationalize ballet to create dance dramas reflecting real life was also not supported; the emphasis was on the dance troupe only engaging in classical national dance dramas. Her request for six students to help her with creative practice has never been realized. She feels that her social status is high, but her artistic labor is very little.

At the meeting, Dai Ailian also raised objections to the Ministry of Culture's consistent use of administrative orders to allocate work and professions. She said, "Originally, I was promised that I would not take on any administrative duties, and I would only engage in creation and performance; however, thirteen hours before the opening ceremony of the Beijing Dance School, the ministry suddenly wanted me to take on the position of principal. I had difficulties, but I had to obey." She also criticized Liu Zhiming, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Culture, for only caring about the dance school and saying that he was not available when other dance groups sought him out. She believes that the Ministry of Culture should comprehensively care about the development of the dance cause.

Dance circles' leaders are not united
Some say there are walls both inside and outside

The lack of unity in dance circles, especially among dance leaders, has been a long-standing fact. Ye Ning said at the meeting: Although our dance circles are young, there are not only "walls" between Party and non-Party members, but also walls within walls, and walls outside walls. She believes that in the past, when it came to the lack of unity in dance circles, it was only seen as a lack of unity between Dai Ailian and Wu Xiaobang, but now it seems that the problem is not that simple. Their artistic views are indeed different, but this did not begin after liberation; it was like this before liberation, but they still cooperated in performances at that time. After liberation, especially in the early days of liberation, these two schools were always criticized as two factions; their art was criticized with dogmatic viewpoints. Ye Ning also pointed out that the nature of the China Dance Art Research Association is unclear, the council is lax, and it cannot even hold meetings. The vast majority of Party member directors only care about the units they work in and do not care about the entire dance cause; the editorial board of the association's only publication, "Dance Communications," cannot be organized, and no one is willing to serve.

Jia Zuoguang also believes that it is difficult for the thoughts of the directors of the China Dance Art Research Association to meet, especially the weak ideological leadership of the Party, which cannot play a core role. He also criticized the suspicion between leaders and their privileged thinking. For example, there was an article criticizing Wu Xiaobang's theory in "Dance Communications," but after he read it, it was not published, and the masses naturally had opinions; in this way, it was impossible to start a theoretical discussion. He also pointed out the abnormal situation between various dance groups, such as disrespecting the labor of others and grabbing programs.

At the meeting, Di Zhi, Fan Peng, Zheng Baoyun, and others expressed their opinions on the fact that "Dance Communications," the only place for dance circles to speak, was forced to suspend publication due to lack of paper; many artists who mastered folk dance art were not valued by the leaders of dance groups, they were brought in when needed, and sent away after use; and there was a lack of concern for mass dance activities.

### 戴爱莲等在座谈会上坦率批评  舞蹈界教条主义宗派主义严重

    戴爱莲等在座谈会上坦率批评
    舞蹈界教条主义宗派主义严重
    本报讯　首都舞蹈界在15日和17日两次座谈内部矛盾问题的会上，揭露了不尊重我国舞蹈专家的艺术见解和创作劳动，以及中国舞蹈艺术研究会的领导涣散和宗派主义情绪。
    在会上，戴爱莲讲到这些年来我国的舞蹈事业有了很大的发展，可是作为舞蹈工作者之一，她一直为着服从革命的需要担任行政工作，完成出国任务，参加社会活动。而在舞蹈艺术上呢？她说：“我是愈来愈感到能力差了，八年来我很少有艺术实践的机会。”她回忆到解放以前，在国民党统治区，各方面的条件虽差，生活也困难，还教了一些学生搞了一些创作；今天环境好了，困难也少了。但是创作反而少得很。她原是华侨，很想通过自己所从事的舞蹈工作来表达对祖国的热爱，她曾创作过“卖”、“游击故事”等作品，也努力学习瑶族、藏族、维吾尔族等民间舞蹈，她认为这些都同党的方针没有矛盾；可是，当舞剧“和平鸽”演出以后，就被教条主义者指责，扣上一顶崇拜西洋、资产阶级文艺思想的帽子；似乎过去的一切都没有用了，什么都需要从头学起。
    戴爱莲过去是中央歌舞团的副团长，现在是中央实验歌剧院舞剧团的团长、北京舞蹈学校的校长，在谈到同党员的合作方面，她说：“我只能听他们的，我的意见不被重视。”她想在舞剧团排演舞剧“罗盛教”，因为演员不愿意，领导上不支持，就停排了。她想把芭蕾舞民族化来创作反映现实生活的舞剧，也得不到支持；强调舞剧团只搞古典的民族舞剧。她只希望有六个学生来帮助她进行创作实践，一直也没有实现。她感到自己的社会地位很高，艺术劳动却很少。
    在会上，戴爱莲对于文化部总是以行政命令的方式来分配工作职业，也提出了意见。她说：“原来答应不让我担任什么行政职务，我只搞创作和演出；但是，在北京舞蹈学校举行成立典礼前的十三小时，部里忽然要我担任校长职务。我有困难也只好服从。”她还批评了文化部刘芝明副部长只关心舞蹈学校，而对其他舞蹈团体的事情找到他就说没有空。她认为文化部应该全面的来关心舞蹈事业的发展。
    舞蹈界领导不团结
    有人说内外都有墙
    舞蹈界，特别是舞蹈界领导闹不团结，是一个长时期以来存在的事实。叶宁在会上说：我们舞蹈界虽然年轻，不仅党与非党之间有“墙”；墙内有墙，墙外也有墙。她认为过去一讲到舞蹈界不团结，就只看成戴爱莲和吴晓邦两个人不团结，现在想来问题并不这么简单。他们两个人的艺术见解的确不同，但这也不是解放以后才开始的，解放以前就是这样，但那时候他们还是合作演出过。解放以后，特别是解放初期一直把这两个学派当成两个宗派来批判；用教条主义的观点批判他们的艺术。叶宁还指出中国舞蹈艺术研究会的性质不明确，理事会涣散，连会都开不起来。绝大多数的党员理事只关心自己工作的单位，对整个舞蹈事业却不关心；这个研究会附属的唯一刊物“舞蹈通讯”的编委会也组织不起来，谁都不愿意担任。
    贾作光也认为中国舞蹈艺术研究会理事们的思想很难见面，特别是党的思想领导薄弱，不能起核心作用。他还批评领导之间互相猜疑，有特权思想。譬如“舞蹈通讯”有批判吴晓邦的理论的文章，经他看过没有登出来，群众自然有意见；这样，就无法从理论上展开讨论。他还指出了各个舞蹈团体之间，互相不尊重别人的劳动、抢节目等不正常情况。
    会上，迪之、范蓬、郑宝云等对于舞蹈界唯一说话的地方“舞蹈通讯”，因为纸张缺乏，被迫停刊；许多掌握了民间舞蹈艺术的艺人不受舞蹈团体领导的重视，需要时找他们来，用过以后送了走；和不关心群众舞蹈活动等问题发表了意见。
