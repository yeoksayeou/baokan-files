Scattered Scales and Claws

Still the same as two years ago
　　In the oil pressing workshop of the Wuxi Municipal Joint Public-Private Oil Factory, people often saw Jin Xingquan, the deputy secretary of the CCP branch, swinging a sledgehammer with the workers to press oil. In the nearly two years that he has been detached from production to work as a full-time cadre, he has always maintained this style.
　　In labor, Jin Xingquan maintained close contact with the workers. The workers regarded him as a confidant, and they would talk to him about everything from production to family life. The staff all reflected that he had no "airs" and said that he was "still the same as when he was a boiler room worker two years ago."

Digging a "Road"
　　A new shopping mall has opened in Hepingli, a northern suburb of Beijing. Many employees and family members of the Ministry of Chemical Industry do not walk on the road when they go to the mall to buy things, but step across the farmland of the common people. Over time, they have trampled the farmland of the common people into wide, long, and hard roads, making it impossible to plant on the newly plowed land, which has aroused the dissatisfaction of the common people. On May 7, Liang Yingyong and Zhang Zhen, Deputy Ministers of the Ministry of Chemical Industry, and Liu Haiyuan, Secretary of the Party Committee of the agency, led more than 20 directors and bureau-level cadres to personally turn the hard road into soft soil and dug ditches at both ends.

Burning Only Four Ounces of Coal for Three Meals a Day
　　The cooks of the Qingdao Commercial School have switched to using horseshoe-shaped stoves for cooking, and each person burns an average of only four liang and two qian of coal for three meals a day. According to the school's general affairs department, this kitchen, which serves more than 380 people, can save more than 57 tons of coal per year.

Broken Fishing Nets Turned into Canvas Trunks
　　The Wenzhou Tannery, a local state-owned enterprise, recently used canvas woven from broken fishing nets to trial-produce beautiful canvas trunks. The appearance is the same as that of embossed pigskin trunks, sturdy and durable, and the price is half that of pigskin trunks. (Lin Zhaotong)

    东鳞西爪
    还和两年前一样
    在无锡市公私合营建成油厂的榨油车间里，人们常常看到中共支部副书记金兴全和工人们一起抡着大锤打油。他在脱产做专职干部的近两年中，始终保持着这种作风。
    在劳动中，金兴全和工人保持了密切的联系。工人把他当知心朋友，从生产到家庭生活，有意见就跟他谈。职工都反映他没有“架子”，说他“今天还同两年前做锅炉间工人时一样”。
    挖“路”
    北京城北郊和平里新开了一个商场，化学工业部不少职员和家属去商场买东西的时候，都不走马路，而从老百姓的耕地上踏过，时间长了，便把老百姓的耕地踏成又宽、又长、又硬的大道，刚翻耕不久的地也没法下种了，引起老百姓的不满。5月7日化工部梁膺庸、张珍副部长和机关党委书记刘海元带领二十多名司、局长级干部，亲自把硬道路变成了松软的土地，并在两端挖了沟。　    （丁力芝）
    一天三餐饭只烧四两煤
    青岛商业学校的炊事员们改用马蹄式炉灶烧饭，每人一天三餐平均只烧四两二钱煤。据学校总务处计算，这个有三百八十多人用饭的伙房，每年可以节约煤五十七吨多。
    破渔网变成帆布箱
    地方国营温州制革厂最近用破渔网织成的帆布试制成美丽的帆布箱。外表看来和压花猪面皮箱子一样，坚固耐用，价格比猪皮箱便宜一半。       （林昭通）
