    Central State Organs Begin Rectification Campaign
    (Our newspaper reports) The Party organizations of central state organs, in accordance with the instructions of the Party Central Committee, have decided to immediately launch a rectification campaign.

    Recently, the Party Committee of the Central State Organs inspected the study situation of the two reports by Comrade Mao Zedong in the central state organs. Based on the inspection results, the thinking of many leading Party cadres lags behind the development of the objective situation. They have not recognized that the country is currently in a new period of dramatic changes, and some Party members have many confused ideas, especially various erroneous understandings of contradictions among the people. Some leading Party cadres even have concerns about the principles of "Letting a hundred flowers bloom, letting a hundred schools of thought contend" and "Long-term coexistence and mutual supervision." In light of the above situation, it is very correct and necessary to conduct rectification in a timely manner.

    In the central state organs, the phenomenon of non-Party cadres having positions without power is still relatively common. Party cadres have serious sectarian tendencies. Recently, under the guidance and assistance of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, some units have begun to examine the united front work of the organs. Judging from the situation examined by these units, if a rectification movement is not carried out and the problem is not genuinely resolved in the minds of Party cadres, it will be difficult to achieve the desired results in improving the united front work.

    Of the more than 50,000 Party members in the central state organs, 73.7% joined the Party after the Seventh National Congress of the Party and have never experienced a rectification campaign. Among the Party members who joined before the "Seventh National Congress," some comrades have also not participated in a rectification campaign. Some veteran Party members who have participated in rectification campaigns have forgotten the historical experience of the Party. The status of the ruling party also easily makes some Party members complacent and arrogant, even fostering ideas of competing for fame and gain, allowing the undesirable tendencies of bureaucratism, sectarianism, and subjectivism to develop.

    Based on the organizational and ideological conditions of the Party organizations in the central state organs, the Party organizations of the central state organs have decided to begin rectification. The Party Committee of the Central State Organs recently held a plenary meeting and began to formulate a specific plan for the Party organizations of the central state organs to carry out the rectification movement.

    中央国家机关开始整风
    本报讯  中央国家机关党组织根据党中央的指示，决定立即开展整风运动。
    最近，中央国家机关党委检查了中央国家机关学习毛泽东同志的两个报告的情况。就检查结果看，许多党员领导干部思想落后于客观形势的发展。他们没有认识到当前国家处在新的剧烈的变化时期，一部分党员存在着许多糊涂思想，特别是对人民内部矛盾有各种错误认识。甚至有些党员领导干部对“百花齐放、百家争鸣”，“长期共存、互相监督”的方针存有顾虑。根据上述情况，及时进行整风是十分正确和必要的。
    在中央国家机关中，非党干部有职无权还是一个较为普遍的现象。党员干部中有严重的宗派主义情绪。最近，在中共中央统战部的指导和帮助下，有些单位开始检查机关的统战工作。从这些单位检查的情况看，如果不进行整风运动，不真正从党员干部思想上解决问题，对统战工作的改进很难收到应有的效果。
    中央国家机关的五万多名党员中，在党的第七次全国代表大会以后入党、完全没有经历过整风运动的党员占73.7％，在“七大”以前入党的党员中，有些同志也没有参加过整风运动。参加过整风运动的老党员，有些已经忘记了党的历史经验。执政党的地位也很容易使一些党员居功自傲，甚至滋长争名夺利思想，使官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义的不良倾向得以发展。
    根据中央国家机关党的组织状况和思想状况，中央国家机关党组织决定开始进行整风。中央国家机关党委最近举行了全体会议，着手制定中央国家机关党组织开展整风运动的具体规划。
