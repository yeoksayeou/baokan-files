True and False Production Increase and Thrift
		Lu Hao

Can production increase and thrift be false? This sounds a bit mysterious. Actually, production increase and thrift are indeed both true and false.

The false production increase and thrift mentioned here, of course, does not refer to the kind of malicious and deliberately deceptive behavior towards the country. Such behavior is, after all, only individual and relatively easy to identify. The problem is that some enterprise leaders often only see one side, forgetting to look at the other side; they only like to hear good things and are unwilling to hear bad things. In a word, they have great one-sidedness in dealing with the issue of production increase and thrift. So although it seems like good intentions and beyond reproach, in reality, it has the name of thrift but not the substance.

For example, some measures seem to be production increase and thrift from one aspect, but from another aspect, they are a waste. A mechanical factory in Shenyang promoted a new working method of "flashless forging," and as a result, the waste of material edges was stopped, but at the same time, the wear rate of the molds continued to increase. The matter of saving material edges was treated as an advanced experience and spread throughout the factory, but the wear of the molds seemed to be unseen by anyone. Whether the value of saving material edges can offset the loss of molds, no one knows the answer to such questions, and no one has a clear idea. Some seem to be striving for production increase and thrift today, but in reality, they become a massive waste tomorrow, which is the result of blindly reducing costs in some construction projects. A staff hospital in Shenyang newly built 5,300 meters of simple dormitories, costing a total of 25,000 yuan. In order to change the partition walls and ceilings made of wooden strips to those made of sorghum stalks, a total of 2,500 yuan was saved. However, now the partition walls made of sorghum stalks instead of wooden strips shake when shaken, and the ceilings have collapsed and fallen, and it is estimated that the repair costs this year will be 9,000 yuan. The production increase and thrift plans in some places seem very high on the surface, making people feel that the results are great, even almost the same as the original production plan of the enterprise. But after careful consideration, no one can figure out which can be regarded as production increase and thrift plans and which cannot. A power repair factory in Fushun has a production plan this year to manufacture twenty-two Donbass combine electric motors, but the factory's production increase and thrift plan also aims to produce twenty such electric motors. Is the factory's production plan set too low? Or is the production increase and thrift plan false? No one can say for sure.

Although the gradual deepening of the production increase and thrift movement has exposed many false phenomena, this does not mean that vigilance can be relaxed. The more in-depth the movement develops, the more attention should be paid to the struggle against false phenomena. Only by thoroughly carrying out the struggle against false phenomena can the production increase and thrift movement truly achieve practical results. The production increase and thrift we need is not a number suspended on the books, but a real improvement in labor productivity, reduction in costs, and creation of tangible wealth for the country. Any untrue and false production increase and thrift should be resolutely opposed.

### 真假增产节约

    真假增产节约	陆灏
    增产节约还能有假的吗？这话听起来好像有点玄。其实，增产节约确实有真的，也有假的。
    这里所说的假增产节约，当然不是指那种存心不良、故意欺骗国家的行为，那种行为毕竟只是个别的，也是比较容易辨认的。问题是发生在有一些企业的领导者，眼睛往往只看到这一边，忘了看那一边；耳朵只喜欢听好的，不愿意听坏的。一句话，他们对待增产节约这个问题有很大的片面性。所以尽管看起来好像是一片好心，无可非难；但实际上却是有节约之名无节约之实。
    譬如，有的措施从这方面看起来是增产节约；从另一方面看却是浪费。沈阳有个机械工厂推行了“无毛边锻造”的新工作法，结果料边的浪费是被制止了，但同时模具的损耗率却不断地增加。节约料边这件事被当作一件先进经验在全厂传播，而模具的损耗好像谁也没有看见。究竟是节约料边的价值能不能抵得上模具的损耗，像这样的问题，问谁也不知道，谁的心里也没有数。有的是今天看起来好像是努力增产节约，实际上明天就变成大量浪费，有些建筑工程盲目降低造价的结果便是如此。沈阳市有一个职工医院新建了五千三百公尺的简易宿舍，造价共二万五千元，为了把木条做的间壁墙、天棚改成用秫秸做，共节约了二千五百元。但是现在用秫秸代替板条的间壁墙一摇就动，天棚也倒坍跌落，估计今年的修缮费用就要花九千元。有的地方的增产节约计划从表面上看订得很高，猛一下使人感到成绩很大，甚至和企业原来的生产计划都差不多。可是细细一想，究竟哪些能算是增产节约的计划，哪些又不能算是增产节约的计划，真真假假，谁也捉摸不透。抚顺有个电修厂，今年的生产计划是制造二十二台顿巴斯康拜因电动机，但这个厂的增产节约计划也要生产二十台这样的电动机。究竟是厂的生产计划订得低了？还是增产节约计划有虚假？谁也说不清。
    增产节约运动的逐步深入，虽然使许多虚假现象已经暴露出来；但是这并不意味着就可以放松警惕。运动发展得越深入，同虚假现象的斗争就越应该引起注意。反对虚假现象的斗争越进行得彻底，才能使增产节约运动真正收到切实的效果，我们所需要的增产节约，不是悬空地挂在账本上的数字，而是真正为国家提高了劳动生产率，降低了成本，实实在在地创造了财富。任何不实事求是的虚假的增产节约，都应该坚决反对。
