Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, May 13th: The Indonesian government issued a statement yesterday expressing its intolerance for activities that attempt to subvert the government by force. Jakarta sources believe that this statement was issued in response to the recent case in Jakarta where an attempt to overthrow the government was uncovered.

The statement pointed out that recently discovered illegal and subversive activities that attempt to use force are intended to "change the national political system by unconstitutional means" and "endanger the integrity of the Indonesian nation and people." The statement said that the government cannot condone or tolerate these activities.

The statement acknowledged that recently some local areas have expressed dissatisfaction with the central government, and this has developed to the point of unauthorized actions. The government understands the reasons for these incidents, and therefore regards resolving the relationship between the central government and local areas as the government's current priority.

However, the government solemnly declares that the resolution of these problems must be carried out in accordance with the following guidelines: maintaining the integrity of the Indonesian nation and state, and all the people's wishes must be expressed through legitimate institutions.

Jakarta's "People's Daily" published an editorial today welcoming the government's statement. The newspaper believes that the arrests made a few days ago in the Bayulan district of Jakarta are of great significance for eliminating the activities of the anti-state conspiracy group.

The editorial pointed out that some military officers participated in the secret meeting held in Bayulan, and a copy of former Vice President Hatta's speech at the "Unity in Diversity" conference in Makassar was also found at the venue. This secret meeting was closely related to the "Unity in Diversity" conference. The editorial said that these facts prove that this conspiracy is very serious. The newspaper hopes that the government will continue to maintain the same clear attitude towards the Bayulan incident.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, May 14th: Indonesian Prime Minister Djuanda has postponed his flight to Makassar to resolve local issues there until today. Djuanda was originally scheduled to go to Makassar yesterday, but the trip was postponed due to busy affairs. Army Chief of Staff Nasution, who was originally scheduled to go with him, remained in Jakarta for some reason.

Before leaving Jakarta, Prime Minister Djuanda told reporters that if the situation does not allow, he will limit the scope of this inspection to Makassar.

    印度尼西亚政府声明
    不能容忍颠覆活动
    据新华社雅加达13日电　印度尼西亚政府昨天发表声明，对企图用武力来颠覆政府的活动表示不能容忍。雅加达人士认为，这个声明是针对最近在雅加达破获的企图颠覆政府的案件而发出的。
    声明指出，最近发现企图使用武力来进行的非法活动和颠覆活动，是要以“违反宪法的手段来改变国家政体”，“危害印度尼西亚国家和民族的完整”。声明说，政府不能赞同和放任这些活动。
    声明承认，最近发生了一些地方对中央不满的事情，并且已经发展到擅自行动的程度。政府了解发生这些事件的原因，因此把解决中央与地方的关系问题作为政府当前的首要任务。
    但是，政府郑重声明，解决这些问题必须根据下述的方针来进行，那就是：保持印度尼西亚民族和国家的完整，人民的一切愿望必须通过合法的机构来表达。
    雅加达“人民日报”今天发表社论欢迎政府这个声明。报纸认为，几天以前在雅加达巴油兰区的逮捕行动，对肃清反对国家的阴谋集团的活动，具有重大的意义。
    社论指出，有一些军官参加了巴油兰举行的秘密会议，在会场里还搜出了前副总统哈达在望加锡举行的“异中求同”大会上发表的演讲稿。这个秘密会议同“异中求同”大会有密切的关系。社论说，这些事实证明这个阴谋是很严重的。报纸希望政府继续保持对待巴油兰事件那样的明确态度。
    据新华社雅加达14日电　印度尼西亚总理朱安达延迟到今天坐飞机到望加锡去解决当地的地方问题。朱安达原定在昨天到望加锡去的，因为事务繁忙而延期。原定同去的陆军参谋长纳苏蒂安因故留在雅加达。
    朱安达总理在离开雅加达以前对记者说，如果情况不允许，他将把这次视察的范围局限在望加锡。
