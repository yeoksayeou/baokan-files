Xinhua News Agency, 6th - Voroshilov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, along with Vice-Chairman Rashidov, Minister Yelyutin, Deputy Minister Fedin, and other accompanying personnel, left Beijing at 4:30 AM on the 6th aboard a Tu-104 jet, bound for a visit to the Republic of Indonesia. After visiting Indonesia, Chairman Voroshilov will continue his visit to China.

Those who saw him off at the airport included Chairman Liu Shaoqi, Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice-Premier Chen Yun, Vice-Premier He Long, Vice-Chairman Peng Zhen, and Vice-Chairman Zhang Bojun and Bao Erhan of the National Committee of the CPPCC.

Soviet Ambassador to China Yudin, Indonesian Ambassador to China Wijopranto, and Burmese Chargé d'Affaires ad interim U Ba Maung also saw him off at the airport.

At 6:13 this morning, Chairman Voroshilov and his entourage, en route from Beijing to Jakarta, stopped at an airport near Xi'an, where they were warmly welcomed by more than two thousand people from all walks of life in Shaanxi Province and Xi'an City. After resting at the airport for more than an hour, the distinguished guests continued their journey by special plane from Xi'an at 7:42 AM.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 6th - Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Voroshilov, arrived in Jakarta from Beijing by jet plane at 4:30 PM today.

Jakarta welcomed the Soviet dignitaries with the most solemn and enthusiastic ceremonies. As Voroshilov's plane landed at the airport, a 21-gun salute was fired, and at the same time, thousands of peace doves flew into the sky. Old Voroshilov, waving his hat, stepped off the plane with a beaming smile. Indonesian President Sukarno immediately stepped forward to embrace and kiss him.

Accompanied by the President, Old Voroshilov reviewed the guard of honor. At this moment, a squadron of Indonesian Air Force planes flew over the airport to salute Old Voroshilov. Then, Old Voroshilov shook hands with the Indonesian Prime Minister, Speaker of the Parliament, cabinet members, members of Parliament, Chiefs of Staff of the Armed Forces, representatives of various political parties, and foreign envoys to Indonesia at the airport to welcome him.

Tens of thousands of enthusiastic people inside and outside the airport cheered and applauded Old Voroshilov and other Soviet dignitaries who accompanied him, such as Vice-Chairman Rashidov, Soviet Minister of Higher Education Yelyutin, and Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Fedin.

In his speech at the airport, Sukarno said that Voroshilov was visiting Indonesia as a representative of a great country, and he expressed his gratitude on behalf of the Indonesian government and people. He said that Voroshilov had come among the Indonesian people who are waging a revolutionary struggle for the country's complete independence, social prosperity, and world peace. He can see that Indonesia has not yet achieved the hoped-for achievements in construction, but the Indonesian people will work hard.

Sukarno said that Voroshilov would stay in Indonesia for thirteen days.

In his speech, Voroshilov said that he conveyed the good wishes of the Soviet people to Indonesia and believed that cooperation in economic, cultural, and other fields between the two countries, based on equality and mutual benefit, would surely develop well.

Voroshilov pointed out that imperialism is creating tension and expanding armaments and preparing for war. The Soviet people advocate banning nuclear weapons testing, reducing armaments, abolishing all foreign military bases, withdrawing all foreign troops, completely eliminating colonialism, and granting all nations the right to self-determination.

After Voroshilov's speech, the Mayor of Jakarta presented Voroshilov with the golden key to the city of Jakarta. Old Voroshilov said that he would regard it as a symbol of the ever-developing friendship between the Indonesian and Soviet peoples.

Subsequently, Old Voroshilov, accompanied by Sukarno, rode in an open-top car to the Independence Palace to rest. As the car left the airport, countless people rushed forward to cheer the two heads of state, so that the car often had to stop. Many large banners were hung outside the airport, with slogans such as "Long Live the Eternal Friendship between Indonesia and the Soviet Union!" "Long Live World Peace!"

Countless people stood on both sides of the road from the airport to the Independence Palace, cheering the heads of state of the Soviet Union and Indonesia.

Xinhua News Agency, Yangon, 6th - Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Voroshilov, arrived in Yangon at 9:40 AM on May 6th, while passing through on his way to Indonesia for a state visit. Welcoming Chairman Voroshilov at the airport were Burmese Prime Minister U Nu, Deputy Prime Minister U Kyaw Nyein, Chief Justice of the Union U Thein Maung, and various ministers.

Chairman Voroshilov, accompanied by Prime Minister U Nu, rested in the airport waiting room for an hour and a half before continuing his flight to Indonesia.
