Caring About the Pain and Suffering of the Masses
Vietnamese Labor Party Leaders Go Down to Factories and Countryside
(Our Hanoi Dispatch, 18th) Recently, leaders of the Vietnamese Labor Party and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have frequently visited factories and rural areas to meet with the working people. President Ho Chi Minh attended the National Industrial Labor Model Congress held in April and spoke with workers at the Nam Dinh Textile Factory. On May 14th, Vo Nguyen Giap, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party, visited Nhan Chinh Township in the suburbs of Hanoi and discussed the issue of rectification work with the farmers. He encouraged demobilized soldiers to play a model role in the countryside. Truong Chinh, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party, visited Phu Xuan Township in Phu Tho Province. When talking to the farmers, he said, "We made mistakes in the land reform. Although the mistakes were serious, the achievements are still fundamental. We must do a good job in rectification, consolidate the achievements of land reform, and gradually advance the countryside on the road of mutual assistance and cooperation, and socialism." Truong Chinh also specifically visited two agricultural production cooperatives in this township, and visited the newly built Phu Tho Tea Processing Factory and Power Plant.
