Xinhua News Agency Report: The conflicts in cross-regional commodity supply between neighboring areas of Hebei and Shanxi provinces have been initially resolved after consultations between the two provincial bureaus of commerce. It is estimated that the implementation of cross-regional supply will save approximately 20,000 yuan in freight annually, and the reduction in industrial product prices will alleviate the people's burden by over 60,000 yuan.

Hebei and Shanxi provinces are contiguous for over a thousand li (Chinese mile), and their neighboring areas have close ties in terms of geography, history, and economy. According to the laws of commodity circulation and historical conditions, industrial products from Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Wuhan, and other cities are generally supplied to Shanxi by Hebei, while agricultural and sideline products flow from Shanxi into Hebei. At the same time, the people in the neighboring areas also maintain the habit of free exchange and mutual purchase of goods. However, in the past, the commercial departments of the two provinces did not sufficiently recognize the importance of cross-regional supply work, which led to many problems. In particular, since 1953, when the state implemented unified purchase and sale of grain, cotton, and oilseeds, and adopted measures to control the sale of some scarce industrial products, the problems became more prominent. In addition, some units in the two provinces often only considered their own business needs, rarely taking into account the difficulties of the other party and the needs of the masses. When materials were abundant, they competed with each other regardless of the rational flow of goods. When materials were scarce, they blocked each other regardless of the rational flow of goods. At the same time, this also violated the rational flow of commodities and increased expenses; more importantly, it artificially divided the economic ties between the people and increased the burden on the people. Although the state has taken measures to subsidize freight to reduce purchase and sale price differences, the purchase and sale prices in the neighboring areas of the two provinces still have a certain gap.

The Commercial Bureaus of Hebei and Shanxi provinces believe that if the issue of cross-regional supply is not properly resolved, it will create contradictions between the government and the people. Therefore, the two provincial commercial bureaus recently resolved this contradiction through consultation.

In this consultation, it was stipulated that areas that are conveniently supplied by their own administrative region and meet economic accounting requirements should be supplied by their own administrative region. If conditions permit direct delivery from the production area, direct delivery should be carried out as much as possible to reduce intermediate links; if direct delivery from the first-level station is not possible, a transfer agency can be set up in the neighboring province for self-transfer. Areas that cannot be solved by the above two methods, whether the entire county or part of the grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives, can adopt the method of cross-regional supply. For areas that have been determined to be cross-regionally supplied, commodities produced in their own administrative region that meet economic accounting requirements in supply, and foreign products supplied by their own administrative region that meet economic accounting requirements, can still be supplied by their own administrative region.

The two provincial bureaus of commerce unanimously believe that to solve the problem of cross-regional supply, it is necessary to adhere to the principle of "treating everyone equally." The supplying unit must treat the cross-regional area as its own business area.

According to the figures determined by both parties through consultation, in the second half of this year, Zhangjiakou Wholesale Station in Hebei Province and six counties will supply industrial products worth a total of 2.96 million yuan to two entire counties and twenty-six grassroots cooperatives in five counties in Shanxi Province. The supply of non-staple foods has also been basically resolved.

These issues were resolved at the cross-regional supply meeting for neighboring areas held by the two provincial bureaus of commerce from the 6th to the 10th.

    河北、山西两省商业厅经过协商后
    商品跨区供应中的矛盾已初步解决
    每年可节省运费两万多元减少群众负担六万多元
    据新华社讯　河北、山西两省毗邻地区商品跨区供应中的矛盾，经过两省商业厅协商，已经得到初步解决。据估算，实行跨区供应以后，大约每年可以节省运费两万多元，因工业品价格降低还可以减少群众负担六万多元。
    河北、山西两省南北相接有千余里，毗邻地区在地理、历史、经济等方面都有着密切的联系。按照商品流转规律和历史条件，一般是京、津、沪、汉等地的工业品由河北供应山西，而农副产品由山西流入河北。同时毗邻区群众之间也保持着自由串换和相互购买商品的习惯。但是过去两省商业部门对跨区供应工作的重要性认识不足，工作中产生不少问题。特别是从1953年以来，国家对粮、棉、油料实行统购统销，以及对一些不足的工业产品采取掌握销售的措施，问题就更显得突出。加上两省某些单位往往只从本单位的业务出发，很少考虑对方的困难和群众的需要，在物资充裕时，便不顾商品的合理流向互相竞销，在物资不足时，又不顾商品的合理流向互相封锁。同时，这样做也违反了商品的合理流向，增大费用开支；更重要的是人为地分割了群众间的经济联系，加重了群众负担。虽然国家采取补贴运费的办法缩小购销差价，但是两省毗邻地区的购销价格仍有一定距离。
    河北、山西两省的商业厅认为，如果不适当解决跨区供应的问题，就会造成政府与人民群众之间的矛盾。因此，最近两省商业厅通过协商的方式，来解决这个矛盾。
    在这次协商中，规定了凡是由本行政区供应方便而且符合经济核算的地区，应该由本行政区供应。有条件由产地直调的，尽量直调，减少环节；凡是无条件从一级站直调的，可以在邻省设立转远机构自行中转。不能采取以上两种办法解决的地区，不论整个县或部分基层供销社，都可以采用跨区供应的方法。对已经确定跨区供应的地区，凡是本行政区生产的在供应上又符合经济核算的商品，以及由本行政区供应符合经济核算的外地产品，仍然可以由本行政区继续供应。
    两省商业厅一致认为，解决跨区供应问题，必须坚持“一视同仁”的原则。供应单位必须将跨入地区当作自己的业务区。
    根据双方协商确定下来的数字，今年下半年要由河北省的张家口批发站和六个县供应山西两个整县和五个县的二十六个基层社的工业品总值为二百九十六万元。对副食品的供应，也基本上得到解决。
    这些问题是在6日到10日两省商业厅召开的毗邻地区跨区供应会议上解决的。
