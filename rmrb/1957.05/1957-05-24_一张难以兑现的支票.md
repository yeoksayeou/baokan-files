    A Check That's Hard to Cash
    Since the beginning of this year, Western news agencies have been constantly reporting that Franco's Spain is about to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Washington has carried out a series of activities in order to install Franco into this aggressive military alliance.
    In early April, the U.S. Congress passed a resolution requesting the State Department to continue its mediation in order to achieve the goal of having Spain join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and become a member of this organization.
    At the same time, the United States is also eagerly planning to find suitable positions for Franco's military leaders in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the first of whom is the notorious commander of the "Blue Division," Grandes, the current Minister of the Army under Franco. This Nazi general, who once gleefully rejoiced at being awarded the "Iron Cross" by Hitler himself, recently visited the Pentagon, where he was warmly received by American generals.
    In fact, American diplomats have been actively working to get other member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Group to agree to accept Spain. In order to increase the momentum of this activity, an optimistic view about Spain's participation in NATO has been spread.
    Why is the United States so enthusiastic about lobbying for Spain? Thomas Gordon, chairman of the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee, gave the most standard answer. He said: Because the United States has military bases in Spain, it is only natural for Spain to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
    But it is not as easy as the American planners think to make the people who have suffered from the Nazis and fought against Franco's fascism forget these past events. Most member states of the North Atlantic Treaty have expressed their opposition. The Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs specifically issued a statement saying that it "does not want Spain to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization." Norway's second largest newspaper, "Dagbladet," published an editorial fiercely criticizing "those Americans who want to force Norway to approve Spain's participation in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization."
    Seeing that the situation was not right, the United States made final remedial efforts on the eve of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council meeting. Washington's plan was to pave the way for Spain to join the group by strengthening the military ties between the North Atlantic Group and Spain. U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff General Twining visited Madrid, where he discussed base establishment plans and steps for Spain to enter the North Atlantic Group with Franco at the Pardo Palace.
    However, the United States' calculation was once again disrupted. At the NATO Council meeting in Bonn, the issue of British disarmament caused fierce debate, and Dulles, fearing a chain reaction, had to hastily conclude the meeting, and the plan to bring Spain in had to be "sacrificed" with pain.
    It seems that the check that Twining gave Franco in the Pardo Palace is difficult to cash for the time being.

### 一张难以兑现的支票

    一张难以兑现的支票
    今年年初以来，西方通讯社不断传出消息说，佛朗哥西班牙即将参加北大西洋公约组织。华盛顿为了能把佛朗哥安插到这个侵略性军事同盟中来，进行了一系列活动。
    4月初，美国国会通过了一项决议，要国务院继续斡旋，以便达到使西班牙参加北大西洋公约组织，并且成为这个组织的一员的目的。
    同时，美国还迫不及待地策划为佛朗哥的军事首脑们在北大西洋公约组织中物色适当的位置，其中首先是臭名昭彰的“蓝色师团”的指挥官格朗德斯，现任佛朗哥陆军部长。这个当年曾经手舞足蹈地庆幸自己荣获了希特勒亲授的“铁十字勋章”的纳粹将军，不久前走访了五角大楼，在那里受到了美国将军们的热诚接待。
    事实上，美国的外交人员早就在积极地活动使北大西洋公约集团其它成员国同意接纳西班牙了。为了增加这种活动的声势，还散布了一种关于西班牙参加北大西洋公约的乐观论调。
    为什么美国这样热心地为西班牙奔走呢？美众议院外交委员会主席托马斯·戈登作了最标准的答案。他说：因为美国在西班牙拥有军事基地，所以使西班牙参加北大西洋公约组织是理所当然的事情。
    但是要曾经身受纳粹之害并且对佛朗哥法西斯战斗过的人民忘记这些往事却并不像美国的策划人所想的那么容易，北大西洋公约的多数成员国都表示了反对的意见。挪威外交部特地发表声明，表示“不希望西班牙参加北大西洋公约组织”。挪威第二家最大的报纸“日报”发表社论，猛烈抨击“想迫使挪威赞成西班牙参加北大西洋公约组织的那些美国人士”。
    美国看到风头不对，在北大西洋公约组织举行理事会前夕，做了最后的补救工作。华盛顿的打算是通过从军事方面加强北大西洋集团同西班牙联系的办法，为西班牙加入这个集团铺平道路。美国空军参谋长特文宁将军不辞辛苦访问了马德里，在豹宫和佛朗哥商谈了建立基地的计划和使西班牙进入北大西洋集团的步骤。
    但是，美国的算盘这次又打乱了。在北大西洋公约组织理事会波恩会议上，英国裁军问题引起了激烈辩论，担心连锁反应的杜勒斯不得不让会议仓促卷席，把西班牙拉进来的计划只好忍痛“牺牲”了。
    看来，特文宁在豹宫给佛朗哥许立下的支票一时是难以兑现了。
