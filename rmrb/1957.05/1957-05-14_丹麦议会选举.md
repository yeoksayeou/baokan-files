Danish Parliamentary Elections

Denmark is scheduled to hold parliamentary elections on May 14. At that time, two million voters will vote to elect 179 members of parliament.

Denmark is a constitutional monarchy. The King is the head of state. The King appoints the leader of the majority party in parliament as Prime Minister based on the election results, and organizes the cabinet. The King exercises executive power through the cabinet. Laws passed by parliament must be signed by the King to take effect.

The Danish parliament originally had two chambers, the upper house and the lower house. After the constitution was amended in 1953, the upper house was abolished, and only the lower house was retained. The original upper house had seventy-six members, and the lower house had one hundred and fifty-one members, but after the merger there were only one hundred and seventy-nine members (including two each from the Faroe Islands and Greenland). Members serve a four-year term. Elections are conducted by secret direct ballot using a system of proportional representation by region. Voters must be citizens over the age of twenty-three.

The last election was held in September 1953. At that time, the ruling Farmer's Party and the Conservative Party suffered great defeats in the election, winning only seventy-two seats in total, losing their majority position; while the Social Democratic Party, which appeared as an opponent of the government's policies, won seventy-four seats. Therefore, the Social Democratic Party formed the government that exists until now. (Ba)

    丹麦议会选举
    丹麦定于5月14日举行议会选举。届时将有二百万选民投票选举一百七十九名议员。
    丹麦是一个君主立宪国家。国王是国家元首。国王根据选举结果任命议会中的多数党领袖为首相，组织内阁。国王通过内阁行使行政权。议会通过的法律必须经国王签字后才生效。
    丹麦的议会原来有两院，即上院和下院。1953年修改宪法后，上院被取消，仅保留下院。原来上院有七十六名议员，下院有一百五十一名议员，合并后仅为一百七十九名议员（包括法俄尔群岛和格陵兰各两名在内）。议员任期四年。选举按地区比例代表制以秘密直接的投票方式进行。选民必须是二十三岁以上的公民。
    上次选举是在1953年9月举行的。当时执政的农民党和保守党在选举中遭到了很大的失败，一共只得到七十二席，丧失了多数的地位；而以反对政府政策的姿态出现的社会民主党获得七十四席。因此，由社会民主党组成了直到现在的政府。（拔）
