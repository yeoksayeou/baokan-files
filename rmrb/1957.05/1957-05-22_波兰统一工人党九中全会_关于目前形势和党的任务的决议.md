Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, May 21st: According to a report by the Polish Press Agency, the resolution of the Ninth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party on the current situation and the most important tasks of the Party stated that the program formulated by the Party at the Eighth Plenary Session is being gradually implemented amidst a complex political situation and economic difficulties.

    **The Majority of the People Unite Around the Party**

    The resolution stated that, in the period after the Eighth Plenary Session, the vast majority of the people across the country, together with the working class, have united around the Party and its new leadership. However, reactionary elements do not intend to abandon their anti-people, anti-socialist struggle. Their attacks are mainly directed at the United Workers' Party, which is the leading force of the people's state. The aim of these attacks is to destroy the structure of the people's democratic system, in order to undermine the socialist achievements of the working people, change the direction of Poland's development, and turn it back towards a bourgeois regime, towards imperialism. After the Eighth Plenary Session, during the election campaign, and after the victory in the parliamentary elections, the main conflict that manifested itself was the conflict between the forces of people's democracy and the forces hostile to socialism.

    **Criticizing So-Called National Communism**

    The resolution stated that the Eighth Plenary Session chose a new path for the construction of a socialist system suited to the conditions in Poland. The Party inextricably linked this attitude with proletarian internationalism, with the consistency of the goals and aspirations of all socialist countries, and with the principle of unity within the socialist camp. The Party firmly opposes the nationalist interpretation of the concept of sovereignty, which violates the international solidarity of socialist countries and the Soviet-Polish alliance. The Party's attitude has no, and can have no, common ground with so-called national communism, which is something fabricated by imperialist propaganda in order to alienate socialist countries. The Party is fighting against chauvinism, anti-Soviet sentiment, and all attempts to incite animosity towards domestic minorities.

    **Opposing Attempts Hostile to the People's Government**

    The resolution pointed out that the Party has facilitated the rehabilitation of people who were unjustly accused and persecuted in the past, but the Party firmly opposes the revival of hostile ideas and the attempts of organizations hostile to the People's Government and often becoming tools of foreign imperialism. The Party cannot allow the correct struggle against bureaucracy and over-centralization of power to be transformed into an attack on the entire machinery of the people's regime. The Party has restored full respect for human rights, and has launched a struggle against abuse of power and illegal acts against citizens, but the Party opposes anarchy, the relaxation of social discipline, and the undermining of the authority of the authorities. No one shall violate the law.

    The resolution continued by pointing out that the Party has normalized relations between the state and the church, but while there is broad religious freedom, there must be no discriminatory attitude towards non-believers, and all church personnel must have a civic attitude that conforms to the interests of the state and the People's Government.

    The resolution stated that in order to prove that the Party can assume the responsibility of determining the fate of the country, the Party must first overcome ideological wavering and political confusion among some of its activists. The Party is firmly loyal to the principles of Marxism-Leninism.

    **Opposing Dogmatism and Sectarianism**

    The resolution also stated that in the period after the 20th Congress of the CPSU, especially at the Eighth Plenary Session of the Polish United Workers' Party, the Party overcame dogmatism and sectarianism. However, dogmatic ways of thinking and sectarian working habits remain a great danger in the activities of the Party and its activists, and must be systematically opposed within the Party through the Party's ideological influence and political work.

    The resolution stated that the sharp criticism of past dogmatism has led to a tendency among politically unsteady comrades to run to the other extreme: to turn to revisionism and to doubt the scientific basis of our ideology. In the current situation, revisionism is the main ideological danger within the Party. While continuing to oppose all manifestations of dogmatism and paving the way for creative Marxism, we must resolutely oppose any manifestation of deviation from our ideology, and we must oppose such manifestations in the Party's propaganda, newspapers, universities, and research institutions.

    **Practicing the Principles of Inner-Party Democracy**

    In overcoming the weaknesses of inner-Party life, the resolution considered that a point of decisive importance is to constantly develop and practice the principles of inner-Party democracy. Inner-Party democracy must be manifested in the daily contact of Party responsible personnel with ordinary Party members. The Party must educate its cadres to have a high sense of responsibility to the masses. The Party must require its activists to maintain close ties with the working people, report their work to them, explain the Party's policies, and patiently listen to the criticisms of the masses. From the Central Committee upwards, members of Party organizations at all levels, staff of Party organs, and all major activists should participate as often as possible in the meetings of basic-level Party organizations in industrial enterprises and in workers' general meetings.

    **Strictly Guarding Against Disrupting Party Unity**

    The resolution stated that the Party must be united. Some people have attempted to undermine the unity of the Party ranks, to level accusations against the Party's line as decided by the Eighth Plenary Session, and to make vicious personal attacks on leading personnel who faithfully implement the Party's policies. The Party cannot remain indifferent to this attempt to disrupt Party unity. On the other hand, the Party will not remain indifferent if anyone in the Party ranks insists that the Party has abandoned its policy of sovereignty and socialist democracy, or that the Party is unwilling to thoroughly correct the deviations of the previous period; nor will the Party remain indifferent if anyone spreads chauvinism and anti-Soviet sentiment.

    The Central Plenary Session called on all Party organizations and Party organs to resolutely oppose all manifestations of sectarian activity and to strengthen Party unity centered on the Party's leadership. The Central Committee warned all those who support any form of factional and sectarian activity that the Party will take sanctions against them, up to and including expulsion from the Party.

    **Raising the Living Standards of the Working People**

    The resolution then described the Party's current tasks. It stated that the main objective of the Party's economic policy is to continuously raise the living standards of the working people as socialist construction progresses. The resolution also stated that, due to the Soviet Union's cancellation of Poland's debt and its provision of large loans to Poland, and due to loans from Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, and other countries, the prospects for the development of the national economy have become brighter. In the current situation, the most important task of the state's economic policy is to strive for market balance and to prevent the rise of living costs. In view of localized unemployment in some parts of the country, and in view of the reduction of administrative agencies, providing more employment opportunities is an important task of the state's economic policy.

    **Creating Conditions for Increasing Agricultural Production**

    The resolution considered that the Party's most important task in the countryside is to create conditions for further increasing agricultural production. In this regard, respecting the property of the peasants and creating conditions for them to freely dispose of their property is particularly important. In order to correctly carry out urban-rural exchange, the system of fixed-quota purchase of grain must be abolished.

    The resolution considered it necessary to constantly strengthen ties with the middle peasants, and to pay special attention to helping and strengthening the small peasants.

    The resolution stated that a pressing issue at present is to fight against speculation, corruption, bribery, and theft and waste in production and trade.

    **Opposing the Idea of Handing Enterprises Over to Employees**

    When discussing the issue of workers' committees, the resolution stated that the Party opposes the idea of handing enterprises over to the employees of the enterprise as collective property, and also opposes the demand for the establishment of a vertical system of workers' committees based on production sectors, considering these ideas to be incorrect and harmful to socialist construction.

    Regarding the issue of expanding the powers and autonomy of people's congresses at all levels, the resolution considered that a considerable part of the power of provincial organs should be transferred to counties and towns, that the transfer of local industrial enterprises to people's congresses at all levels should be completed within 1957, and that the financial autonomy of local people's congresses should be increased.

    **Developing Various Forms of Cooperatives**

    The resolution stipulated the specific tasks of Party organizations at all levels in the large-scale development of various forms of cooperatives and the development of peasant autonomy in the form of agricultural teams. The resolution stated that Party organizations at all levels should point out the correct direction for these organizations, help farmers in poor economic conditions, protect them from exploitation by the wealthy, oppose speculative tendencies, and defend the principles of the worker-peasant alliance.

    At the same time, Party organizations should also give special care to agricultural cooperatives, so that they can obtain state assistance and the services of state-owned machinery stations.

    The resolution stated that an extremely important political task is to consolidate the National United Front. The Polish United Workers' Party politically leads the life of the state in cooperation with the United Peasant Party and the Democratic Party. All progressive, socialist, and patriotic forces, Party members and non-Party members, cooperate with each other in the National United Front. Cooperation between political parties and the National United Front should become a long-term factor in the political life of the country.

    The resolution continued by saying that the whole Party must care about youth and must restore political activity under the leadership of the Party among youth. Party organizations should abide by the principles of the organizational independence of youth and the freedom to engage in broad social activities, and play a guiding role through Party members who actively participate in the youth movement. The task of Party organizations is to exert a direct influence on youth, to care for them in many ways, in order to better meet their demands, protect their rights, and cultivate their discipline, sense of responsibility, perseverance, and patriotism.

    波兰统一工人党九中全会
    关于目前形势和党的任务的决议
    新华社华沙21日电　据波兰通讯社报道，波兰统一工人党中央委员会第九次全体会议关于目前形势和党的最重要的任务的决议说，党在八中全会上拟订的纲领，正在复杂的政治局势和经济困难中逐步实现。
    大多数人民团结在党周围
    决议说，在八中全会以后的时期，全国绝大多数人民同工人阶级一起，团结在党和党的新领导的周围。但是，反动分子并不打算放弃反人民、反社会主义的斗争。他们的攻击主要针对作为人民国家领导力量的统一工人党。这些攻击的目的是要摧毁人民民主制度的结构，以便破坏劳动人民的社会主义成果，改变波兰的发展方向，使它向资产阶级政权、向帝国主义倒退。在八中全会以后，在竞选运动期间，以及在议会选举取得胜利之后，表现出来的主要冲突是人民民主力量和敌视社会主义的力量之间的冲突。
    批判所谓民族共产主义
    决议说，八中全会选择了符合波兰情况的新的社会主义制度的建设道路，党把这种态度同无产阶级国际主义，同所有社会主义国家目标和愿望的一致，以及同社会主义阵营团结的原则，不可分割地连结了起来。党坚决反对对主权概念的民族主义的解释，这是违背社会主义国家的国际团结，违背波苏联盟的。党的态度同所谓民族共产主义没有而且不能有任何共同之处，所谓民族共产主义是帝国主义宣传为了离间社会主义国家而杜撰出来的东西。党正同沙文主义、反苏情绪以及煽动国内少数民族恶感的一切企图进行斗争。
    反对敌视人民政府的企图
    决议指出，党促成了过去受到不公正控告和迫害的人们恢复名誉，但是党坚决反对恢复敌对思想，反对那些敌视人民政府并常常成为外国帝国主义的工具的组织的企图。党不能让反对官僚主义和权力过分集中的正确斗争转化成为对整个人民政权机器的攻击。党已经使人权重新获得了充分尊重，已经发动了反对滥用职权和对公民犯有非法行为的斗争，但是党反对无政府状态，反对社会纪律松弛和破坏当局的威望。任何人都不得违反法律。
    决议接着指出，党已经使国家和教会之间的关系正常化了，但是，在有了广泛的宗教自由的同时，不得对非教徒采取排斥的态度，并且所有教会人员必须具有一种符合国家和人民政府利益的公民态度。
    决议说，为了证实党能够担负起决定国家命运的责任，党必须首先克服在它的部分积极分子中思想上的动摇和政治上的混乱。党坚决忠于马克思列宁主义的原则。
    反对教条主义和宗派主义
    决议又说，在苏共第二十次代表大会以后的时期中，特别是在波兰统一工人党八中全会上，党克服了教条主义和宗派主义。但是，教条主义的思想方法和宗派主义的工作习惯在党和党的积极分子的活动中仍然是很大的危险，必须在党内用党的思想影响和政治工作有系统地加以反对。
    决议说，对过去的教条主义的尖锐批评，在政治上不坚定的同志中间引起了跑向另一极端的倾向：跑到修正主义方面去，并且怀疑我们意识形态的科学根据。在目前情况下，修正主义是党内主要的思想上的危险。在继续反对教条主义的各种表现并且为创造性的马克思主义铺平道路的同时，必须全力反对脱离我们的意识形态的任何表现，必须在党的宣传中、报纸中、大学和研究机关中反对这样的表现。
    实践党内民主原则
    在克服党内生活的弱点方面，决议认为，具有决定性重大意义的一点就是不断发展和实践党内民主的原则。党内民主必须表现在党的负责人员同一般党员的日常联系上。党必须教育它的干部，使他们具有对群众高度负责的精神。党必须要求它的积极分子同劳动人民保持密切的联系，向他们报告自己的工作，解释党的政策，耐心地倾听群众的批评。从中央委员会起，各级党组织的成员、党机构的工作人员和一切主要的积极分子，都应该尽可能经常地参加工业企业中基层党组织的会议和工人全体大会。
    严防破坏党的统一
    决议说，党必须是一致的。有人企图破坏党的队伍的团结，对八中全会所决定的党的路线提出责难，还对忠实执行党的方针的领导人员进行恶毒的人身攻击。党对破坏党的团结的这种企图不能漠视不顾。另一方面，如果党的队伍中有任何人硬说党背弃主权和社会主义民主的政策，硬说党不愿意彻底纠正前一时期的偏差；如果有任何人散布沙文主义和反苏情绪，党也不会漠视不顾。
    中央全会号召一切党组织和党的机构坚决反对一切宗派活动的表现，加强以党的领导为中心的党的团结。中央委员会向所有支持任何形式的集团和宗派活动的人提出警告：党将要对他们采取制裁，直到开除出党。
    提高劳动人民生活水平
    决议接着叙述了党的当前的任务。它说，党的经济政策的主要目的是，随着社会主义建设的进展，不断地提高劳动人民的生活水平。决议又说，由于苏联取消了波兰所欠的债务并且给了波兰大量的贷款，由于捷克斯洛伐克、民主德国和其他国家的贷款，国民经济发展的前景变得更加光明了。在目前情况下，国家经济政策的最重要的任务，就是争取市场平衡，防止生活费用上涨。鉴于国内某些地区局部性的失业现象，鉴于行政机构的裁减，提供更多的就业机会是国家经济政策的一个重要任务。
    为增加农业生产创造条件
    决议认为，党在农村中的最重要的任务是要为进一步增加农业生产创造条件。在这方面，尊重农民的财产和为他们自由处理自己的财产创造条件是特别重要的。为了正确地进行城乡交流，必须取消粮食定量收购制度。
    决议认为必须经常加强同中农的联系，特别注意帮助和加强小农。
    决议说，当前一个迫切的问题是要同生产和贸易中的投机、贪污、贿赂以及盗窃和浪费现象进行斗争。
    反对把企业交给职工的主张
    决议在谈到工人委员会的问题时说，党反对把企业作为集体财产交给该企业职工的主张，也反对根据生产行业建立工人委员会的垂直系统的要求，认为这些主张是不正确的，对社会主义建设是有害的。
    关于扩大各级人民会议的权力和自治范围的问题，决议认为，应该把省级机关的相当大一部分权力移交给县和镇，在1957年内完成把地方性的工业企业移交给各级人民会议的工作，增加地方人民会议的财政自治权力。
    发展各种形式的合作社
    决议规定了各级党组织在大规模发展各种形式的合作社和发展以农业小组为形式的农民自治方面的具体任务。决议说，各级党组织应该给这些组织指出正确的方向，帮助经济状况不好的农民，保护他们不受富有者的剥削，反对投机倒把的倾向，保卫工农联盟的原则。
    同时，党组织也应该对农业合作社特别关怀，使它们可以获得国家的援助和国营机器站的服务。
    决议说，一个极端重要的政治任务就是巩固全国统一阵线。波兰统一工人党是在同统一农民党和民主党合作的情况下在政治上领导国家生活的。一切进步的、社会主义的和爱国的力量，党员和非党人士，都在全国统一阵线中互相合作。政党间的合作以及全国统一阵线应该成为国家政治生活中长期存在的因素。
    决议接着说，全党必须关心青年，必须在青年中恢复在党的领导下的政治活动。党组织应该遵守青年的组织独立和从事广泛的社会活动的自由的原则，通过在青年运动中积极活动的党员发挥指导作用。党组织的任务在于对青年发挥直接的影响，多方关怀他们，以便更好地满足他们的要求，保障他们的权利，培养他们的纪律性、责任感、坚忍性和爱国主义精神。
