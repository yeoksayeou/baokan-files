Knowledge leading ignorance, or ignorance leading knowledge? Of course, it should be knowledge leading ignorance, not ignorance leading knowledge. The question is how to understand knowledge and ignorance.

During the revolutionary war period, some older comrades had relatively low levels of education, which caused "dissatisfaction" among some "intellectuals" who considered them ignorant. But in fact, they were long-tested in revolutionary struggles and possessed a wealth of knowledge. In reality, they led military and political work very well. Practice is the standard of truth. Although their education was lower, it should be affirmed that they were knowledgeable.

Now, I hear of the following things:

A leading cadre, when mobilizing everyone to pay attention to the study of the "Eighth National Congress" documents, said: "These eight big documents are very important, and we must study them seriously and well..."

A county party committee propaganda minister, when discussing the "Hundred Schools of Thought" policy with intellectuals, actually pronounced "百家争鸣" (bǎi jiā zhēng míng - "Hundred Schools of Thought contend") as "百家争鸣" (bǎi jiā zhēng míng - "the cry of alas!"), not to mention how he "cried."

Are such responsible cadres knowledgeable or ignorant? In their own view, of course, they are knowledgeable. When others have some opinions about their leadership work, don't they often use "I've crossed more bridges than you've walked roads!" and "You're not even as good as my old belt!" as shields? In terms of class struggle and revolutionary war experience, their knowledge is indeed considerable. But today, they cannot but be considered truly ignorant.

Why? Because the situation has changed now. The period of revolutionary storms has passed, and now the main task is economic and cultural construction. These comrades do not understand the new situation of great social change, neither do they make good use of absorbing new knowledge and studying the party's policies, nor do they have the honest attitude of "to know what you know, and to know what you do not know." In particular, they still have the bad attitude of "pretending to know when they don't," and "once power is in hand, orders are given at will." This is the height of ignorance. Leading knowledge with such ignorance, it is certain that it is impossible to continue leading.

Great social change is like a sharp turn of a car. When we are on a public bus about to turn, the conductor always reminds us: "Hold on tight, turning!" Some people are careless and turn a deaf ear. As a result, as soon as the car turns, they really fall down. Today, some comrades are also nonchalant and do not study and transform themselves well. If one day they fall from their leadership positions, who should they blame?

    有知与无知
    凡兵
    有知领导无知呢？还是无知领导有知呢？当然是应该有知领导无知，而不是无知领导有知。问题是如何了解有知与无知。
    在革命战争时期，有些老同志文化水平比较低，引起一些“知识分子”的“不满”，认为他们是无知。但其实，他们在革命斗争方面是久经锻炼的，知识是极丰富的。实际上，他们对军事和政治工作也领导得很好。实践是真理的标准。他们文化虽然低一些，但应该肯定地说，还是有知的。
    现在呢，听说有这样几件事情：
    有一位领导干部在动员大家重视“八大”文件的学习时说：“这八个大文件非常重要，必须认真地和好好地去学习。……”
    一个县委宣传部长在同知识分子座谈“百家争鸣”方针时，竟把“百家争鸣”念成“百家争鸣”（鸣乎哀哉的“鸣”），更不用说他“鸣”得怎样了。
    像这样的负责干部是有知呢，还是无知呢？在他们自己看来，当然是有知的。当别人对他们的领导工作有些意见时，他们不是经常以“我过的桥也比你们走的路多！”“你们还不如我这个皮带老呢！”作为挡箭牌吗？论阶级斗争和革命战争的经验来说，他们的知识也确是不少的。但在今天看来，他们却不能不算是真的无知了。
    为什么？因为现在形势变了。革命的暴风雨时期已经过去了，现在主要是搞经济和文化建设了。这些同志不了解社会大变动的新形势，既不好好吸取新的知识，研究党的方针政策，又没有“知之为知之，不知为不知”的老实态度，特别是还有“强不知以为知”，“一旦权在手，便把令来行”的恶劣态度，这真是无知之至了。以这样的无知来领导有知，肯定地说是不可能领导下去的。
    社会大变动，就好像车子大转弯。我们在乘公共汽车将要转弯时，售票员同志总是打招呼说：“扶好，转弯了！”有些人漫不经心，充耳不闻，结果，车刚一转弯，就真地摔倒了。今天有些同志也是满不在乎，不好好去学习和改造自己。如果有一天从领导工作岗位上摔了下来，又该去埋怨谁呢？
