Leadership Should Actively and Properly Arrange Jobs
Employees Should Obey the National Interest and Do Whatever is Needed

Editor's Note: Last year, both the scale of capital construction and production tasks grew very rapidly. In order to complete these tasks, many enterprises added a large number of new workers. This year, investment in capital construction has decreased compared to last year, and some production enterprises have also seen a reduction in production tasks due to limitations in raw materials. Therefore, the problem of surplus labor has emerged in these enterprises. If this problem is not solved, it will lead to idleness and cause significant losses to the country. If it is not handled properly, it will create considerable difficulties for the lives of the workers. This is one of the current internal contradictions within enterprises. The following news items illustrate that as long as the leadership attaches importance to this issue, clearly explains the real situation to the masses, and actively seeks ways to provide opportunities for the surplus labor force, and if the workers prioritize the overall interests of the country, and do not pick and choose jobs, but go wherever they are needed, this contradiction can be resolved relatively satisfactorily.

    劳动力多余的问题可以解决
    领导方面积极主动妥善安排
    职工服从国家利益有啥干啥
    编者按　去年，基本建设规模和生产任务都增长得很快。为了完成任务，很多企业增加了大批新工人。今年，基本建设投资比去年减少，有些生产企业因为受原材料的限制，生产任务也比去年减少了。因此，在这些企业中就出现了劳动力多余的问题。这个问题如果不解决，就会造成窝工，使国家受很大的损失；如果解决得不妥善，又会给职工的生活造成很大的困难。这也是目前企业内部的矛盾之一。下面这几条消息说明，只要领导方面重视这个问题，把真实情况向群众讲清楚，积极设法给多余的劳动力谋求出路；在职工这方面，以国家整体利益为重，不挑肥拣瘦，哪里需要就到哪里去，这个矛盾是可以得到比较完满的解决的。
