    Flower Seeds, Gardens, and Gardeners
    Gao Zhi
    In Zhongshan Park in Beijing, I often see the beautiful scene of a hundred flowers blooming.
    There are two kinds of “hundred flowers blooming,” and they can coexist without contradiction. One is the grand "hundred flowers blooming," which is a hundred kinds of flowers blooming together. The other is the small "hundred flowers blooming," which is a hundred varieties of one kind of flower blooming together. A hundred kinds of flowers are certainly a riot of color; one kind of flower can also be iridescent. In the crisp autumn season, I have seen chrysanthemum exhibitions; in the days of “bright sunshine and good spring weather,” I have seen “peonies opening and peonies blooming.” I cannot count the varieties of chrysanthemums, and I cannot remember the lovely names of the peonies.
    The Party's policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom" is not a temporary or local policy. Therefore, I think there are two more sentences that should be coordinated with "letting a hundred flowers bloom."
    One is "spring throughout the four seasons." A hundred flowers should bloom in warm and sunny weather, but also in the bleak autumn wind, and even in the days of ice and snow. The flower conservatory in Zhongshan Park is an example of this.
    The other is "luxuriant growth in all directions." This means that not only does one place have a hundred flowers blooming, but all directions, within a radius of thousands of miles, have a hundred flowers blooming. Not only does Zhongshan Park have flowerbeds and conservatories, but all parts of the country should gradually have gardens and greenhouses.
    "Luxuriant growth in all directions" and "spring throughout the four seasons" are the issues of combining "letting a hundred flowers bloom" with time and space. And the prerequisite for this problem is the issue of flower seeds, gardens, and gardeners.
    Flower seeds refer to the types and quantity of flowers. The issue is not just a hundred kinds of flowers and a hundred varieties of one kind of flower. We also require that famous flowers can be passed down, and we also hope that new species can appear.
    Gardens refer to the flower's land, including soil, water, and sunlight, which are the flower's material conditions. In literature, these are newspapers, magazines, publishing houses, as well as remuneration methods and circulation numbers.
    Gardeners refer to the techniques of cultivating flowers, the methods of protecting flowers, and the ability to select flowers; translated into literature, these are ideological advocacy, organizational leadership, and artistic guidance, which are the flower's spiritual conditions.
    With gardens and gardeners, but few flower seeds, there cannot be a hundred flowers blooming.
    With gardeners and flower seeds, but small gardens, there cannot be a hundred flowers blooming.
    With flower seeds and gardens, but clumsy gardeners, there cannot be a hundred flowers blooming.
    The issue of flower seeds, gardens, and gardeners is both a quantitative and a qualitative issue. We hope that these three are both numerous and good. However, from few to many, from prosperity to greater prosperity, from bad to good, from improvement to greater improvement, we cannot just sit and wait, nor can we rush things. It has a certain time process.
    There are also various contradictions among flower seeds, gardens, and gardeners, and resolving these contradictions also takes a certain time process.
    The issue of flower seeds, gardens, and gardeners must be correctly resolved in order to achieve "letting a hundred flowers bloom"; it must be constantly and correctly resolved in order to achieve "spring throughout the four seasons"; it must be universally and correctly resolved in order to achieve "luxuriant growth in all directions."
    Today's question is not whether we can achieve "luxuriant growth in all directions" and "spring throughout the four seasons"; but rather to seize the time, try to advance it as much as possible, and realize the high degree of prosperity of socialist literature and art in the new China as soon as possible.
    The great and correct policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom" is the arrow, and the high degree of prosperity of socialist literature and art is the target; this is shooting with a definite target. However, to hit the target every time, it depends on how we release the arrow, and it depends on the implementation of the policy. I hope that in the perfect and excellent execution of the policy, we can also go one step further.
    Regarding gardens, I hope that we neither waste money nor delay what should be done.
    Regarding flower seeds, I hope that in addition to gardens and greenhouses, we also pay attention to wild flowers. And wild flowers should not be limited to the "wild flowers by the Zhuque Bridge" within the city, but also the "reed flowers in front of the islet" outside the city.

    花种，花园，花师
    高植
    在北京中山公园，我常常看到百花齐放的美景。
    百花放有两种，并行不悖。一种是大百花齐放，是一百种花齐放；一种是小百花齐放，是一种花的一百品种齐放。一百种花固然是万紫千红；一种花也能够五光十色。在秋高气爽的季节，我看过菊花展览；在“艳阳天，春光好”的时日，我看过“芍药开，牡丹放”。我数不清菊花的品种，我记不清牡丹的芳名。
    党的百花齐放的政策，不是一时一地的政策。因此，我想，还有两句话是和百花齐放相配合的。
    一个是四季皆春。百花要在风和日暖中齐放，也要在萧瑟秋风中齐放，还要在冰天雪地的日子里齐放。中山公园的花坞便是一例。
    一个是九方同茂。这就是，不仅仅一个地方百花齐放，而且四面八方、方圆万里之内都百花齐放；不仅仅中山公园有花圃花坞，全国各地也要逐渐地有花园花房。
    九方同茂，四季皆春——是百花齐放和时间、空间相结合的问题。而这个问题的先决问题是花种、花园、花师的问题。
    花种是指花的种类和数量。问题不只是一百种花和一种花的一百品种。我们还要求名花能够留传，还希望新种能够出现。
    花园是指花的园地，包括土壤、水分、日光，是花的物质条件。在文学方面，便是报纸、杂志、出版社，以及稿酬办法和发行数额。
    花师是指养花的技术，护花的方法，选花的本领；翻译到文学上来便是思想倡导、组织领导、艺术指导，是花的精神条件。
    有了花园、花师，花种少了，就不能百花齐放。
    有了花师、花种，花园小了，就不能百花齐放。
    有了花种、花园，花师拙了，就不能百花齐放。
    花种、花园、花师问题，既是数量问题，也是质量问题。我们希望，这三者又多又好。然而从少到多，从繁荣到更繁荣，从坏到好，从提高到更提高，既不能坐待，也不能急催。它有一定的时间过程。
    花种、花园、花师互相之间，还有各种各样的矛盾，而解决矛盾，也有一定的时间过程。
    花种、花园、花师的问题，得到正确的解决，才能百花齐放；得到经常的正确解决，才能四季皆春；得到普遍的正确解决，才能九方同茂。
    今天的问题，不是能不能九方同茂，四季皆春；而是争取时间，尽量提早，早日实现新中国社会主义文学艺术的高度繁荣。
    伟大正确的百花齐放政策是矢，社会主义文艺的高度繁荣，是的；这是有的放矢。然而要百发百中，就要看如何放矢，要看政策的执行了。我希望，在执行政策的百妥百善中，还能有一个百尺竿头。
    关于花园，我希望既不铺张浪费，也不要当办不办。
    关于花种，我希望在花园花房以外，也注意到野花。而野花也不能只限于城内的“朱雀桥边野草花”，还有城外的“洲前芦荻花”。
