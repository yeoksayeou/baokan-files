Raking Over Old Ground

The preliminary design of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge began in the spring of 1950, and construction began ahead of schedule in July 1955. The bridge adopted the world's most advanced bridge construction method - the "caisson drilling method" - which was successfully tested based on the recommendations of the Soviet expert working group headed by Silin.

The bridge is 1,670 meters long, of which 1,155 meters span the river surface. The bridge has a total of eight piers, each 50 to 60 meters high. The largest ships can navigate under the bridge. The bridge has two layers, the upper layer can accommodate six cars in parallel, and the lower layer can accommodate two trains running in opposite directions. The bridgeheads on both sides are equipped with stairs and elevators, which are exclusively for pedestrians to go up and down the bridge. The original plan stipulated that the railway part of the bridge would be open to traffic in 1958 and the road part in 1959. It is now expected to be completed in October this year.

    旧话重提
    武汉长江大桥是1950年春天开始初步设计，1955年7月提前开始施工的。大桥采用的世界上最新的桥梁施工法——“管柱钻孔法”，是根据以西林为首的苏联专家工作组的建议试验成功的。
    这座大桥全长一千六百七十公尺，其中跨江面那部分为一千一百五十五公尺。大桥共有八个桥墩，每个都有五、六十公尺高。桥下可航行最大的轮船。桥有上下两层，上层可并行六辆汽车，下层可对开两列火车，两岸的桥头堡里装有楼梯、电梯，专供行人上下桥使用。原计划规定：这座大桥铁路部分在1958年通车，公路部分在1959年通车，现在预计今年10月就可全部建成。
