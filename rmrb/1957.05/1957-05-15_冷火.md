　　"Cold Fire" Gao Shiqi
　　Recently, a doctor at Beijing Hospital gave me a medicine called calcium glycerophosphate, which is a compound of phosphorus.
　　Knowledge about phosphorus is needed by the masses, so I decided to write a scientific essay about its discovery and main uses.
　　In the seventeenth century, there was an alchemist in Hamburg, Germany. In his laboratory, he evaporated fresh urine to dryness and then heated the residue to a very high temperature. He discovered some wax-like substances that collected on the test tube. This substance, when exposed to air, would emit a cold and quiet light, which people called "cold fire." This luminous substance is phosphorus.
　　For many years, phosphorus was considered a strange element. People fantasized about using this "cold fire" to turn silver into gold, but repeated experiments were unsuccessful.
　　What exactly is phosphorus used for? It was still a mystery.
　　In the nineteenth century, this mystery was finally revealed.
　　The great German chemist Liebig said: "The presence of phosphorus is of great value to the life of plants. Spreading the compounds of 'cold fire' in the fields can increase crop yields."
　　But where can we find so much phosphorus to meet the needs of vast fields?
　　The discovery of apatite solved this problem.
　　Apatite is a light green ore. Miners transport it to large ore dressing plants, where it is crushed, impurities are removed, and it is ground into powder. Trainloads of it are sent to chemical factories, where it is transformed into a new white powder through the action of sulfuric acid. This is phosphate.
　　Phosphate is phosphate fertilizer, and it has been serving agricultural production for many days.
　　Currently, the world produces more than ten million tons of phosphate fertilizer annually.
　　In our country, the reserves of apatite are also very abundant. Since liberation, more than a dozen important phosphate mines have been discovered, including one in the southwest region that has been proven to be one of the largest phosphate mines in the world. In this way, our country has a reliable guarantee for the phosphate fertilizer needed to develop agricultural production in the next twelve years.
　　Besides being used as fertilizer, what else is phosphorus used for?
　　We know that bones contain phosphorus. Without phosphorus, bones cannot grow so strong. The brain also contains a lot of phosphorus. Without phosphorus, mental work cannot be carried out. From this, we can see how much the human body needs the nourishment of phosphorus! If food lacks phosphorus, the entire body will weaken.
　　No wonder many phosphorus-containing medicines are very beneficial for people with neurasthenia and those recovering from illness.
　　Not only do humans need phosphorus, but other animals also need phosphorus. Phosphorus can enrich the nutrients in seawater. Spreading phosphorus compounds in harbors will rapidly multiply algae and microorganisms, resulting in an increased rate of fish reproduction, making fish grow faster, more abundant, and fatter.
　　Our food industry needs phosphorus. Several high-grade sodas are made with phosphoric acid.
　　Our steel industry also needs phosphorus. The best stainless steel uses phosphate as a coating. If the various parts of an aircraft are coated with phosphate, they will not rust.
　　Our match industry needs phosphorus even more. Everyone knows that phosphorus is a major raw material for making matches!
　　In today's chemically developed world, phosphorus has become the "mother" of many compounds. These compounds each have their own advantages and are widely used. In addition to what has been mentioned above, they are also used in the soap and detergent industry, the textile, leather, and oil refining industries, and in the manufacture of insecticides and preservatives. It is said that at least one hundred and twenty industrial sectors are now using compounds of this "cold fire."
　　"Cold fire" can also be used to make "cold fog." It is indispensable in the military industry; smoke bombs are its product. The incendiary bombs dropped by enemy aircraft also contain a large amount of phosphorus. Therefore, we must also be vigilant about phosphorus.

### “冷火”

    “冷火”	　高士其
    北京医院的大夫，最近给我吃一种药品叫做甘油磷酸钙，这是磷的一种化合物。
    关于磷的知识是群众所需要的，因此，我决定就它的发现经过和主要用途，写一篇科学小品文。
    十七世纪的时候，德国汉堡地方有一个炼金术士，他在试验室里，把新鲜的尿蒸发干了，再把残渣加热到很高温度，他发现有一些白腊似的东西，集结在试验管上面，这种东西一见空气，会发出冷而静的光，人们叫这种光做“冷火”。这发光的东西就是磷。
    多少年来，磷被认为是一种奇异的元素。人们幻想着利用这种“冷火”把银子变成金子，但是，屡次试验都没有成功。
    磷究竟有什么用处呢？还是一个谜。
    在十九世纪中，这个谜终于被揭穿了。
    德国的大化学家利比喜说：“磷的存在，对于植物的生命有很大的价值。把‘冷火’的化合物撒在田地里，可以提高庄稼的收成。”
    但是，哪里有这样多的磷，可以供广大田野的需要呢？
    磷灰石的发现，解决了这个问题。
    磷灰石是一种浅绿色的矿石，矿工们把它运进了大选矿厂，在那儿，它被碾碎，除掉杂质，研成粉末，一列车一列车地送到化学工厂里去，经过硫酸的作用，变成一种新的白色粉末，这就是磷酸盐。
    磷酸盐就是磷肥，它开始为农业生产服务，已经有很多日子了。
    现在全世界每年所制造的磷肥，为数达到一千万吨以上。
    在我国，磷灰石的储藏量也非常丰富。解放后，已经发现的重要磷矿就有十几处之多，其中在西南地区有一个磷矿，已经证明是世界上最大磷矿中的一个。这样，我国在十二年内发展农业生产所需要的磷肥，就有了可靠的保证了。
    除了作肥料以外，磷还有什么用处呢？
    我们知道，骨头里含有磷，没有磷，骨头就不能长得那样结实。大脑也含有很多的磷，没有磷，思想工作就不能进行。这样看来，人体是多么需要磷的滋养啊！食物里如果缺乏磷，整个身体就会衰弱下去。
    怪不得，有许多含磷的药品，给神经衰弱的人和病才好的人服了很有好处。
    不但人体需要磷，其他动物也需要磷。磷能丰富海水中的养料。把磷的化合物撒在海港里，水藻和微生物就会迅速地繁殖起来，结果提高了鱼类的繁殖率，使鱼类生长得又快、又多、又肥大。
    我们的食品工业需要磷。有几种高级汽水，就是用磷酸来制造的。
    我们的钢铁工业也需要磷。最好的不锈钢，就是用磷酸盐来作涂料的。飞机的各部分，如果涂上磷酸盐，也就不会生锈。
    我们的火柴工业更需要磷。谁都知道，磷是制造火柴的一种主要原料呀！
    在化学发达的今天，磷已成为许多种化合物的“母亲”，这些化合物各有各的长处，用途很广，除了上面所说过的以外，在肥皂和洗涤工业上；在纺织、制革和炼油工业上；在杀虫剂和防腐剂的制造上，也都用得着它们。据说：现在至少有一百二十个工业部门都在利用这种“冷火”的化合物哩。
   “冷火”又可以制造“冷雾”。在军事工业上也少不了它，烟幕弹就是它的产品。敌人飞机所施放的燃烧弹，也含有大量的磷。所以对于磷，我们还必须提高警惕。
