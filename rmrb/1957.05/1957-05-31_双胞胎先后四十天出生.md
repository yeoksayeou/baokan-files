    Twins Born Forty Days Apart
    In Gia Thuy village, Gia Vien district, Ninh Binh province, North Vietnam, a woman named Dinh Thi Nhu gave birth to a boy at the end of January this year. However, after the delivery, her abdomen remained greatly distended and there was a sensation of movement inside. Forty days later, she gave birth to another boy. The two boys look very similar. Now they are almost three months old, and the mother and both boys are doing well in all aspects. Giving birth to twins forty days apart is a relatively rare phenomenon. This event has aroused great interest in Vietnamese medical circles, and some experts are studying it.

    双胞胎先后四十天出生
    越南北部宁平省嘉远县嘉水乡有一位妇女叫丁氏洳今年1月底生育了一个男孩，但是分娩后腹部仍然大胀且有蠕动现象，隔了四十天又生育另一个男孩，这两个男孩面目很相像。现在已经快三个月了，产妇和两个男孩子各方面情况都很正常。相隔四十天生育双胎儿，这是一种比较稀有的现象。这件事引起越南医学界很大的兴趣，有的专家正在研究中。
