Xinhua News Agency, May 1st—On May 1st, people from all walks of life in cities across the country held gatherings and parades to celebrate International Labor Day.

    In Shanghai, 200,000 people participated in the gatherings and parades. In the parade, workers from the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory and the Shanghai Boiler Factory, who had won excellence in the national inter-factory competition in the same industry, marched at the front of the 120,000-strong workers' contingent. A banner held by the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory stated that 90% of the factory's workers had set personal saving targets, which would reduce costs by 1.76 million yuan for the year. Students marched past the rostrum singing and cheering. Many of their banners read "We are the reserve force of the labor front" and "Aspire to be the first generation of knowledgeable farmers in New China."
    In Tianjin, 150,000 people participated in the "May Day" parade today. Six thousand advanced producers marched at the front of the 90,000 workers who made up the parade contingent. A large banner they held read: "Spend less money, use fewer materials, employ fewer people, increase production, do more work, and do a lot more, faster, better, and more economically." One hundred members of minority ethnic groups, including Tibetans and Uyghurs, from faraway Lhasa, Urumqi and other places, also joyfully participated in the parade today in their ethnic costumes.
    In Wuhan, the parade contingent of 150,000 working people slowly passed the reviewing stand in the rain. At the front of the workers' contingent of more than 60,000 people, a model of the No. 1 blast furnace of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Joint Enterprise and heavy construction machinery rumbled past. The people of the city warmly applauded the builders of Wuhan Iron and Steel, who guaranteed that the No. 1 blast furnace would be completed and put into production by the end of 1958. In the parade contingent, farmers carried huge banners saying "Welcome graduates of primary and secondary schools to participate in agricultural production," and students carried "Study to participate in labor production."
    In Shenyang, 400,000 people gathered and paraded. At the beginning of the parade, at the forefront of the contingent of more than 32,000 workers were the workers of the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Factory. Although this factory had been rebuilt and put into production for only a little over a year, it had produced nine of the latest precision lathes, drilling machines, and pipe cutting machines.
    In Guangzhou, from 8:00 a.m., tens of thousands of people flocked to seven districts to participate in the celebrations. Returned overseas Chinese, relatives of overseas Chinese, and residents of the Pearl River also held celebrations and get-togethers. The district head of the Pearl River District and the secretary of the district's CCP committee, among others, also had heart-to-heart talks with representatives of the water residents, listening to their opinions on the government's work.
    The mountain city of Chongqing was flying red flags everywhere today, and more than 130,000 people braved the rain to participate in the gatherings and parades. In the ranks of workers, troops, students, and industrialists and businessmen, many leaders and the masses participated in the parade together. The vice chairman of the Chongqing Iron and Steel Company's trade union, the director of the Chongqing Machine Iron Factory, and the party committee secretary, director, and trade union chairman of the Chongqing Enamel Factory all personally led the parade. He Chongde, the party committee secretary of the Chongqing Enamel Factory, participated in the factory's band today, carrying a big drum at the front of the procession. Marching in front of the industrial and commercial contingent were fifty vice chairmen and members of the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce.
    In Xi'an, 150,000 people of all ethnic groups cheered slogans today, holding a grand parade amid gongs, drums, and musical instruments that resounded throughout the city. The ranks of construction workers, who are changing the face of Xi'an day by day, stretched for several miles. In recent years, they have added more than 6.4 million square meters of building area to the ancient city of Chang'an.
    In Lhasa and Xigaze in the Tibetan plateau, Tibetan and Han workers also gathered to celebrate International Labor Day.
    In the evening, a celebration attended by more than 1,000 Tibetan and Han workers was held in the Lhasa Auditorium. The workers here listened to a report by Tan Guansan, deputy secretary of the CCP Tibet Working Committee. After the meeting, films and dramas were performed.
    More than 500 Tibetan and Han workers in Xigaze gathered to celebrate "May Day" Labor Day. More than 200 Tibetan workers who attended the meeting were participating in "May Day" celebrations for the first time. They came from the construction site of the newly built thermal power plant, the dike of the Nyang Chu River under construction, and the construction site of houses. Shi Tingzhu, deputy director of the preparatory committee of the Xigaze Federation of Trade Unions, spoke at the meeting, encouraging Tibetan and Han workers to unite closely, help each other, and build Tibet together.
