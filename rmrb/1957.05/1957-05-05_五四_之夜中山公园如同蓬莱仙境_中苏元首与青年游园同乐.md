Xinhua News Agency, 4th: Chairman Voroshilov and Chairman Mao Zedong together attended a garden party held in Zhongshan Park tonight to celebrate the "May Fourth" Youth Day. This party was held by youth from all walks of life in the capital to welcome Chairman Voroshilov.

As the sunset glow faded and the new moon hung in the sky, the towering ancient cypress trees in the park were lit with colorful electric lights. Eighteen famous artistic troupes were scattered in eight places, performing various brilliant programs. Among the green trees and beside the peony flowers about to bloom, young men and women in full dress were talking and laughing, some dancing, excitedly waiting for the two chairmen to come here and celebrate their festival with them.

At 8:10 p.m., Chairman Voroshilov and Chairman Mao Zedong arrived at the Altar of Earth and Grain amidst the cheers of the youth. Here, the Beijing University Student Choir began its performance with a magnificent chorus. More than 160 male and female students sang "Moscow-Beijing," a song praising the great friendship between China and the Soviet Union, with smiles, and then sang "We Are the Young People." Chairman Voroshilov then watched the performance of the acrobats. He repeatedly applauded the performers in the pole climbing and other programs, and praised them repeatedly for performing wonderfully, very wonderfully, and excellently. When he saw the rope skill performers tie a soft rope into a circle and pass it up and down, left and right through their bodies, Chairman Voroshilov appreciatively said that this was a soft rope, but he had turned it into a steel wire.

In the square in front of Zhongshan Hall, right next to the Altar of Earth and Grain, a group of university students were dancing in a circle. Chairman Voroshilov and Chairman Mao Zedong entered the dance circle of Tsinghua University students. They accepted the invitation of two female students, Xu Yongxian and Li Xiaomei, wearing bright red Mongolian national costumes, and danced a dance with them. Chairman Voroshilov started by dancing a social dance, and then enthusiastically led his dance partner in a Ukrainian dance. Deputy Chairman Rashidov, Vice Chairman Zhu De, Chairman Liu Shaoqi, and Premier Zhou Enlai also danced with the students.

When entering Zhongshan Hall for a rest, Hu Qili, Chairman of the All-China Students' Federation, wished the elder Voroshilov a long life on behalf of students and youth across the country.

Elder Voroshilov shook Hu Qili's hand tightly and said, "I thank you, you have organized it so well today. I wish you good studies, study well!"

Hu Qili said, "The great Soviet Union will always be a model for us to learn from."

Elder Voroshilov said, "What is our model? Our model is to educate our youth with Marxist-Leninist thought and to educate the youth with the arduous revolutionary deeds of the older generation to struggle for a happier and better life. In this way, we will truly set an example."

Hu Qili also said, "The Soviet Union will always be our big brother."

Elder Voroshilov said, "We learn from each other and set examples for each other."

Chairman Voroshilov and Chairman Mao Zedong watched a group of young dance actors perform the Korean dance of carrying water on their heads, and the Chinese classical sword dance in the West Woods, and then walked south, arriving at a place where more than 600 Chinese and Soviet children were having a get-together. Two little fairy girls, about ten years old, holding lotus flowers and lotus leaves, ran to the two chairmen and said, "We are the Hehe Erxian (the Immortals of Harmony and Union) sent by the children's world, please come to our place." Chairman Mao smiled and asked, "You want us to come, what program will you show us?" Hehe said, "Please watch many dances." As the two chairmen approached the woods, they heard a burst of crisp bird sounds. The little birds and squirrels immediately reported the news of the arrival of the distinguished guests to the children on the trees. The little white rabbit, the little deer, and the monkey jumped out of the cave when they heard the good news. Two young pioneers from China and the Soviet Union, wearing red scarves, also rushed to present flowers to the two chairmen on behalf of everyone, and helped the two chairmen into the pine forest like a mythical realm. Four fairies dressed in white gauze, with shining flower crowns on their heads, sprinkled a large number of petals on the two chairmen. After the distinguished guests were seated, the young actors from the Beijing Dance School first performed "Pulling Radishes," and the students from the Beijing Soviet Middle School then performed the "Wicker Hoop Dance."

Mayor Peng Zhen invited the two chairmen to go elsewhere to take a look, but Elder Voroshilov said with great interest, "Don't go, I'm attracted, let's watch for a while!" The "Mazurka" dance performed by students from the Beijing Dance School appeared on the stage again. After each program, the two chairmen applauded and praised.

The distinguished guests also watched a puppet show and walked through the dancing crowd.

Elder Voroshilov said, "Today's party is organized so well!" Deputy Chairman Rashidov and Minister Yelyutin said, "It's like entering a fairyland!" Elder Voroshilov's son and daughter-in-law said, "It's simply like a myth, we are reluctant to miss anything, but we don't know what to watch."

Chairman Voroshilov and Chairman Mao Zedong left here amidst cheers. The youth, with happy and joyful hearts, sang and danced until late at night. (Attached picture)

    “五四”之夜中山公园如同蓬莱仙境
    中苏元首与青年游园同乐
    新华社4日讯　伏罗希洛夫主席和毛泽东主席今晚一起出席了在中山公园举行的庆祝“五四”青年节的游园晚会。这个晚会是首都各界青年为欢迎伏罗希洛夫主席而举行的。
    晚霞方落，新月当空，公园里参天的古柏林中亮起了五彩电灯。十八个著名的文艺团体分散在八个地方表演各种精采节目。在绿树丛中，在含苞待放的芍药花旁，盛装的青年男女有的在谈笑，有的在舞蹈，他们兴奋地等待两位主席来这里和他们欢度自己的节日。
    八时十分，伏罗希洛夫主席同毛泽东主席在青年们的夹道欢呼声中来到了社稷坛。在这里，北京市大学生合唱团以雄壮的大合唱开始了表演。一百六十多个男女学生含着微笑演唱了歌颂中苏伟大友谊的“莫斯科—北京”，然后又唱了“是我们——年青人”。伏罗希洛夫主席接着观看了杂技演员的表演，他一再为爬杆等节目的演员们鼓掌，并且连声称赞演得妙极了，演得非常的妙和出色的好。在看到表演绳技的演员把一根柔软的绳子结成圆圈忽上忽下、忽左忽右的穿过自己的身体的时候，伏罗希洛夫主席赞赏地说，这是柔软的绳子，但他却把它变成像一根钢丝了。
    紧靠着社稷坛的中山堂前面的广场上，一群大学生们围起圈子在跳着交谊舞。伏罗希洛夫主席同毛主席走进了清华大学学生们的舞圈，他们接受两个穿着大红的蒙古民族服装的女学生徐永贤和李孝美的邀请，同她们跳了一场舞。伏罗希洛夫主席开始跳着交谊舞，然后又兴致勃勃地带着他的舞伴跳起了乌克兰舞。拉希多夫副主席、朱德副主席、刘少奇委员长、周恩来总理也都同学生们在一起跳了交谊舞。
    在进入中山堂内休息的时候，中华全国学生联合会主席胡启立代表全国学生和青年祝伏老万寿无疆。
    伏老紧紧握着胡启立的手说：“我感谢你们，今天你们组织得太好了，祝你们学习好，好好地学习！”
    胡启立说：“伟大的苏联永远是我们学习的榜样。”
    伏老说：“我们的榜样是什么？我们的榜样就是要用马克思列宁主义的思想教育我们的青年，用老一辈艰苦革命的事迹教育青年为更幸福、更美好的生活而斗争。这样，我们就真正树立了典范。”
    胡启立又说：“苏联永远是我们的老大哥。”
    伏老说：“我们彼此是互相学习，互相树立榜样。”
    伏罗希洛夫主席和毛主席在西树林里观看了一群青年舞蹈演员们表演的朝鲜族舞蹈顶水舞，和中国古典舞剑舞以后向南走去，来到了六百多个中苏儿童联欢的地方。两个手持荷花和荷叶的十多岁小女孩装扮的小仙女奔到两位主席面前说：“我们是儿童世界派来的和合二仙，请你们到我们那儿去。”毛主席笑嘻嘻地问：“你们要我们来，给我们什么节目看。”和合说：“请你们看很多舞蹈。”两位主席走近树林就听到一阵轻脆的鸟声，小鸟儿、松鼠在树上立即把贵宾来了的消息报告给孩子们，小白兔、小鹿、猴子听到喜讯从山洞里跳了出来，两位带着红领巾的中苏少先队员也代表大家忙着向两位主席献花，把两位主席搀进了神话境地般的松林。四个仙姑穿着白色纱衣，头上戴着闪闪发光的花冠，把大批的花瓣撒在两位主席身上。当贵宾们入座后，北京舞蹈学校的小演员们首先表演了拔萝卜，北京苏联中学的学生们接着演出了藤圈舞。
    彭真市长请两位主席到别处去看看，伏老兴致勃勃地说：“别走，被吸引住了，再看一会吧！”舞台上又出现了北京舞蹈学校学生表演的“玛佐卡”舞。每个节目演完后，两位主席都鼓掌称赞。
    贵宾们又看了木偶戏，从跳舞的人群中走过。
    伏老说：“今天的晚会组织得真好！”拉希多夫副主席和叶留金部长说：“如入仙境！”伏老的儿子和儿媳说：“简直像神话一样，什么都舍不得不看，但又不知看什么好。”
    伏罗希洛夫主席和毛主席在欢呼声中离开了这里。青年们怀着幸福愉快的心情一直歌舞到深夜。（附图片）
