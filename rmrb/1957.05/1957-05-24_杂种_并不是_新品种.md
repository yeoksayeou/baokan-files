    "Hybrid" is not a "New Breed"
    The People's Daily published a report on March 25th titled "Quartermaster of a PLA Unit Cultivates a New Breed of Pig." Comrade Su Guifa's emphasis on pig breed improvement and his dedication to studying feeding methods are commendable. However, it is incorrect to consider the hybrid pig obtained by crossing Yorkshire pigs with Hunan pigs as a "new breed."
    "Breed" is a concept in animal husbandry, referring to a group of domestic animals created by humans under specific socio-economic conditions. A breed must first have a sufficient number to allow for selective breeding and non-consanguineous reproduction; otherwise, it is impossible to maintain the breed's characteristics and structure, thus losing the conditions necessary for a breed. From this perspective, it is incorrect to call twelve pigs a newly cultivated breed.
    In addition, a breed should have stable genetic characteristics; otherwise, it will not be possible to form a fixed type for long-term reproduction. Therefore, hybrid offspring with unstable heredity, no matter how great their economic value, cannot be considered a new breed.
    The meaning of the concept of "breed" has many other aspects, but here, I will only briefly mention these two.
    Developing a new breed is not a simple task. It requires a series of breeding measures over a long period to complete.
    According to the news report, Comrade Su Guifa only obtained a hybrid pig by crossing Yorkshire pigs with local Hunan pigs. Hybrid pigs generally have the advantages of both parents and have economic value. However, without breeding work, its genetic characteristics are not fixed, so it cannot be considered a "new breed." In order to improve pig breeds, various regions widely use "Yorkshire," "Berkshire," and other fine breed pigs to cross with local pigs, and the offspring produced have varying degrees of improvement in production performance. These hybrid pigs cannot be considered "new breeds."

### “杂种”并不是“新品种”

    “杂种”并不是“新品种”
    3月25日人民日报发表了以“解放军某部司务长培育出一种新品种猪”为标题的报道。苏贵发同志很重视猪种的改良工作，钻研饲养方法，这是很值得表扬的。但是，认为用约克夏猪与湖南猪杂交所得到的杂种猪就是一种“新品种”是错误的。
    “品种”是畜牧学上的一个概念，是人类在一定社会经济条件下所创造的一种家畜类群，一个品种首先应有足够的数量，能够进行选种选配与非亲缘自群繁育，否则就不可能保持品种应有的特征特性与其结构，也就失去了一个品种应具有的条件。从这点看，把十二头猪叫做培育的新品种是不对的。
    另外，品种应有稳固的遗传特性，否则就不可能形成一个固定类型长期繁殖下去。因此，具有动摇遗传性的杂种后代，不论其经济价值多大也不能算作一个新品种。
      “品种”这个概念的含义还有很多，这里只简单地说这两点。
    育成一个新品种不是一件简单的工作。这需要有较长的时间进行一系列的育种措施，才能完成。
    从报上的消息来看，苏贵发同志只是用约克夏与湖南本地猪杂交得到了一种杂种猪。杂种猪一般都具有父母双方的优点，是有经济价值的。但是没有经过育种工作，它的遗传特性是不固定的，因此不能认为是“新品种”。为了改进猪种，各地都广泛利用“约克夏”“盘克夏”等良种猪同本地猪杂交，所产生的后代在生产性能上都有不同程度的提高。这些杂种猪都不能认为是“新品种”。
