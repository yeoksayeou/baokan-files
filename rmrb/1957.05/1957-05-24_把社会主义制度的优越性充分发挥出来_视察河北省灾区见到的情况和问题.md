    Fully Develop the Superiority of the Socialist System
    ——Observations and Problems Encountered While Inspecting Disaster Areas in Hebei Province
    He Siyuan

    Last year, Hebei Province experienced the worst flood in a century. How is the disaster relief work being done? How are the people in the disaster areas living? These are the issues we are concerned about. In April, I made a special trip to inspect seven counties in this province: Nanhe, Renxian, Pingxiang, Feixiang, Daming, Weixian, and Guangping. Five of these were severely affected.

    My home is in Heze County in western Shandong Province, which is close to the above-mentioned counties. Before liberation, I encountered several major floods in Shandong and went to distribute relief funds. The tragic experiences of the disaster-stricken people are still vivid in my mind. During my inspection, I constantly compared various situations and found that this flood was larger than any in Shandong Province. However, thanks to the effective measures taken by the government, the people in the disaster areas overcame the flood and had great confidence in production and survival. The superiority of the socialist system has been fully developed. The difference between then and now is like heaven and earth. I will only talk about a few issues I discovered during my inspection.

    The vast majority of cadres in the disaster areas are diligently serving the people. A small number of cadres have low levels, lack experience, face tight deadlines, and have few solutions. They should be helped to correct their shortcomings in their work.

    Disaster relief work is an extremely urgent, complex, and meticulous task. The government's correct disaster relief policies must be implemented by cadres. Large amounts of relief funds must be distributed by cadres. Large quantities of daily necessities must be supplied by cadres. Large-scale sideline production must be organized and led by cadres. All able-bodied and semi-able-bodied laborers must be uniformly allocated by cadres. All work cannot be carried out without cadres.

    When the flood occurred, cadres personally rescued people trapped in the water and transferred them to safe areas, risking their lives. Some cadres sacrificed their lives for this. For example, Liu Tongqi, a member of the Communist Youth League in Beitai, Nanhe County, and Liu Tonglin, the production team leader, and four others sacrificed themselves in the water one after another while rescuing dike-protecting laborers. Another example is female cadre Wang Shengfen and supply and marketing cooperative cadre Shen Pengde, who entered the water to rescue people in Xigaocun for seven consecutive times overnight. All the cadres did not eat or sleep peacefully while fighting the flood. After the water receded, they rushed to distribute relief funds, transfer grain, supply materials, and stabilize people's lives; then, they encouraged people to plan sideline production, carry out winter planting, and lead people to produce and survive the famine. These selfless and heroic deeds of serving the people moved the people in the disaster areas to tears.

    After the realization of agricultural collectivization, farmers handed over their land to the cooperatives. Farmers often want the cooperatives to be responsible for solving all problems, asking cadres for firewood, rice, clothing, and housing, and even asking cadres for brown sugar when women are in labor, and milk for children who lack milk. If they are slightly dissatisfied, they complain, and if they are given a little leeway, they all follow suit. In fact, it is sometimes difficult to completely satisfy the masses. I think taking care of the economic life of each household, male, female, old, and young, in a large cooperative is more difficult than leading a large agency in Beijing.

    Of course, cadres have shortcomings. Some cadres are uneven in the distribution of relief funds; they overemphasize accumulation; sometimes their attitudes are blunt and their work styles are crude; and there are also cases of using public office for private gain.

    Through this inspection, I believe that these shortcomings are mainly caused by low levels, lack of experience, tight deadlines, lack of solutions, and insufficient patience. However, cadres with these shortcomings are, after all, a minority, and they can be gradually overcome through education. We should not exaggerate shortcomings, attribute the temporary shortcomings of a few cadres to the general cadres, and obliterate their positive aspects. We should care for them and help them.

    People in disaster areas have a new understanding of collectivism but have also developed a dependence mentality.

    The vast majority of cadres in the disaster areas are diligently serving the people, and the vast majority of people in the disaster areas are also full of confidence in carrying out production for self-relief. However, I see that there are still some ideological problems among both cadres and the masses.

    When the flood first occurred, fields and gardens were submerged, and houses collapsed. Some people, seeing the vastness of the disaster area and the large number of people affected, wondered if the government could take care of so many people and provide long-term support. Seeing that the agricultural production cooperatives, which had been organized not long ago, were washed away, everyone could only take care of themselves. Some people sat on their roofs, looking at the vast expanse of water, pessimistic and disappointed, crying to the sky, thinking that they would perish with their fields and gardens.

    The cadres of the rescue team arrived in time, rescuing the people trapped in the flood and properly resettling them. The cadres lived with the disaster victims, sharing their clothes and food, and taking care of them in every possible way. At this time, people deeply felt that the government was responsible and that the cadres brought them warmth. Many elderly people who had experienced vicissitudes of life said, "I have never seen such a big flood in my life, nor have I ever seen such good cadres." Their thinking turned around, they became optimistic, and they were willing to live on.

    Then, the cooperative helped everyone rebuild their homes and restore production. The government's relief funds were distributed again and again, and grain, coal, oil, salt, and daily necessities were transported into the disaster areas from all over the country. Cadres came to the disaster areas batch after batch, sharing weal and woe with the people, and planning to survive the famine. At this time, everyone felt that they were not lonely individual households but members of the big family of the cooperative. They had a new understanding of collectivism and understood that the power of the collective could overcome natural disasters and overcome all difficulties. Everyone thought that such a big flood had been overcome, and there would be even more ways to deal with it in the future.

    Hebei Province has conducted timely comparative education for the disaster victims. In 1943, when a major flood occurred in Hebei Province, many people starved to death, died of illness, many people sold their children, and many people were displaced. Fields were barren, and death filled the roads. This flood was even bigger than the one in 1943, but the situation was completely different. Leaders at all levels in Hebei Province used this fact to conduct comparative education, which played a great role in raising the ideological awareness of the disaster victims.

    However, under the government's meticulous care, some people (including cadres) have developed a dependence mentality: waiting for the government to issue relief funds, asking the government for loans, and helping to develop sideline production. They believe that the land, livestock, and farm tools have all been handed over to the cooperative, and all difficulties should be borne by the cooperative; if they have nothing to eat, they should ask the cooperative, and the cooperative cannot let them starve to death anyway. They only care about the present and not the future.

    There is also waste in the disaster areas, and education on hard work and simplicity should be carried out.

    In the old society, the disaster area was a desolate place: elm trees had no bark, willow trees had no leaves, people looked hungry, and there were starving people on the roads. What I saw this time in the severely affected areas was a completely different scene: everyone had food and clothing. This is, of course, the result of the government's vigorous disaster relief efforts.

    But waste does exist. This is first manifested in the township and cooperative cadres. Everywhere I went, I saw that cadres in the disaster areas all had very good bicycles. When a large cooperative held a meeting, one hundred and twenty cadres arrived, and one hundred and twenty beautiful bicycles were parked in front of the door.

    "What the superiors like, the subordinates will like even more." In addition to the cadres, I saw that many people bought cars when they had money, decorated them beautifully, and flaunted them. Beicun in Nanhe County has a total of five hundred and twelve households, and more than sixty bicycles have been added after the disaster. Some people even ride their bicycles to work in the fields, as if they cannot even walk a few steps. When I went to Xigaocun, I took an ox cart, and the farmer who drove the cart told me that he was a breeder and received 180 yuan this year. He spent 100 yuan to buy a bicycle, and he regretted that the car was old and not as beautiful as others'.

    Daming County is a severely affected area. The total sales of living materials by the county's supply and marketing cooperative in the fourth quarter of 1956 and the first quarter of 1957 were 2,514,525 yuan, while the same period last year was 2,137,164 yuan. Among them, the sales of cigarettes and alcohol in the first quarter of 1956 totaled 500,1328 yuan, while in the first quarter after the flood, it increased to 584,421 yuan, an increase of 17%. Guangping County is a lightly affected area, and the total sales of cigarettes and alcohol in the county in the first quarter increased by 27% compared with the same period last year. The Chengnan Dengta Cooperative in the county has a total of 1,419 households, with 497 bicycles, 2,540 flashlights, 1,120 thermos bottles, and 3,500 uniform hats. Now many people are unwilling to tie their heads with towels.

    I have also been to rural fairs and temple fairs. Those places are crowded with people selling bicycles, rubber shoes, thermos bottles, flashlights, and even selling food, drinks, and jewelry, all of which are doing brisk business. Everywhere I look, the scene is not like a disaster year but a bumper year. There is waste in here. Hebei Province has now proposed to save two jin of grain per person per month. I think this is necessary and possible. It is estimated that this alone can save a lot of grain for the country and reduce a lot of transportation costs. Of course, there are many other places besides grain where savings can be made, which requires an in-depth examination from thought to action, especially the need for cadres to take the lead in advocating it. I believe this trend can be reversed. The people in the disaster areas, under the leadership and support of the government, have already achieved victory in production and disaster relief and will certainly achieve good results in thrift and survival.

    把社会主义制度的优越性充分发挥出来
    ——视察河北省灾区见到的情况和问题
    何思源
    去年河北省发生百年来未有的大水灾。救灾工作做得怎样？灾区人民生活怎样？这些都是我们关心的问题。4月间我特地去视察了这省的南和、任县、平乡、肥乡、大名、魏县、广平等七个县，其中有五个是重灾县。
    我家在山东省西部菏泽县，同以上几县是近邻。解放前，我在山东曾遇到过几次大水灾，也去发放过赈款，对于受灾人民的悲惨遭遇，至今还历历在目。我在视察中间随时将各种情况进行比较，发觉这次洪水比山东省哪一次都大。但由于政府采取了有效措施，灾区人民战胜了水灾，生产渡荒的信心很大，把社会主义制度的优越性充分地发挥出来了。以昔比今，真有天渊之别。这且不说，我只谈谈视察中发现的几个问题。
    灾区绝大部分干部是勤勤恳恳为人民服务的。少数干部水平低，经验差，任务紧，办法少，工作中有了缺点，应当帮助他们改正。
    救灾工作是件十分紧急、复杂、细致的工作。政府的正确救灾方针要干部去执行，大批救济款要干部去发放，大量日用物资要干部去供应，大规模的副业生产要干部去组织领导，全部整半劳力要干部去统一调配，一切工作没有干部是无法开展的。
    水灾发生的时候，为了把困在水中的人民救出来，转移到安全地区，干部都亲自动手，舍身抢救。有些干部为此牺牲了自己的性命。如南和县北大台青年团员刘同起、生产队长刘同林等六人，为了抢救护堤民工，一个接一个地牺牲在水里。又如女干部王省粉、供销社干部沈彭德等在西高庄连夜入水救人，七进七出。所有干部同洪水搏斗时真是日不安食，夜不安枕。水落后，赶紧分配赈款，调运粮食，供应物资，安定人民生活；紧接着鼓励人民筹划副业，进行冬种，领导人民生产渡荒。这些忘我的、为人民服务的英勇事迹，使灾区人民感动得流泪。
    在实现农业合作化，农民把土地交给合作社以后，农民往往要合作社负责解决一切问题，向干部要柴、要米、要衣、要房，甚至妇女在生产时向干部要红糖，小孩缺奶时向干部要奶吃。稍不如意，辄生怨言，而略事放宽，又群起效尤。实际上要使群众完全满意有时是有困难的。我认为要照顾一个大社中各家各户的男女老幼的经济生活，比在北京领导一个大机关还困难得多。
    当然，干部是有缺点的。有些干部在分配赈款时畸轻畸重；过于强调积累；有时态度生硬，作风粗暴；假公济私的情况也是存在的。
    通过这次视察，我认为他们这些缺点主要是由于水平低，经验差，任务紧，办法少，耐心不够等原因所造成的。但是有这些缺点的干部毕竟是少数，而且可以通过教育来逐渐克服的。我们不应该夸大缺点，把少数干部一时的缺点推及到一般干部身上，而抹煞他们的积极方面。我们应当关怀他们，帮助他们。
    灾区人民对集体主义有了新的体会，但又滋长了依赖思想。
    灾区干部绝大多数在勤勤恳恳地为人民服务，灾区人民绝大多数也信心百倍进行生产自救。但是，我看在干部中和群众中也还存在着一些思想问题。
    洪水初发时，田园被淹没了，房屋倒塌了。有些人看到受灾地区那样广，受灾人口那样多，认为政府那里照顾得许多，支援得长久？看到组织起来不久的农业生产合作社被水冲散了，各人只能自己顾自己。有些人踞在自己的屋顶上，举目汪洋一片，悲观失望，仰天痛哭，以为自己要与田园同归于尽了。
    抢救队的干部及时赶来了，把困在洪水里的人们抢救出来，妥为安置。干部同灾民生活在一起，解衣推食，照顾得无微不至。这时人民深深感到政府是负责的，干部给他们带来了温暖。许多历经沧桑的老年人说：“一辈子没有见过这样大的水灾，一辈子也没见过这样好的干部。”他们的思想扭转过来了，乐观起来，愿意生活下去了。
    接着合作社帮助大家重建家园，恢复生产。政府的救济款一次又一次地发下来，全国各地纷纷把粮食、煤炭、油盐和日用品运进灾区。干部一批又一批地来到灾区，和人民同甘共苦，计划渡荒。这时大家又感到自己不是孤苦无依的单干户，而是合作社大家庭中的一员了。对于集体主义有了新的体会，懂得集体的力量可以战胜自然灾害，克服一切困难。大家以为这样大的水灾都顶过去了，以后就更有办法了。
    河北省曾经及时对灾民进行对比教育。在1943年河北省发生大水灾时，不少人饿死，病死，不少人卖儿鬻女，不少人流离失所，真是田园荒芜，死亡载道。这次水灾比1943年还要大，但情形却完全不同了。河北省各级领导用这个事实进行对比教育，对提高灾民的思想觉悟起了很大的作用。
    但是，在政府无微不至的照顾下，有些人（干部也在内）却滋长了一种依赖思想：等待政府发救济款，要求政府给予贷款，帮助搞副业。认为土地、牲口、农具都已交给社，一切困难就应由社包下来；没有得吃就向社要，反正社不能让我饿死。他们竟至只顾眼前，不顾将来了。
    灾区也有浪费现象，应该进行艰苦朴素的教育。
    在旧社会，灾区是一片荒凉：榆树无皮，柳树无叶，民有饥色，途有饿莩。这次我在重灾区所看到的完全是另外一种景象：人人有吃有穿。这当然是政府大力救灾的结果。
    但浪费现象的确是存在的。这首先从乡社干部方面表现出来。我到处看见灾区干部大都有很好的自行车。有一个大社开会时到了一百二十个干部，门前就停放了一百二十辆漂亮的自行车。
      “上有所好，下必有甚焉者”。除了干部以外，我看很多人也是有钱就买车，车上装饰美丽，交相炫耀。南和县北村共五百一十二户，灾后添置了六十多辆自行车。有些人下地干活也骑着车子，好像连几步路也走不动了。我去西高庄的时候坐的是牛车，赶车的农民告诉我，他是个饲养员，今年分到一百八十元。他拿一百元买了一辆自行车，他还惋惜车是旧的，没有别人的漂亮。
    大名县是重灾区，该县供销社1956年第四季度和1957年第一季度生活资料的销售总额为二百五十一万四千五百二十五元，而上年同一时期则为二百一十三万七千一百六十四元。其中烟酒两项，1956年第一季度共销售五十万零一千三百二十八元，而水灾后第一季度却增至五十八万四千四百二十一元，即增加了17％。广平县是轻灾区，该县第一季度烟酒销售总额比上一年同期增加27％。该县城南灯塔合作社共一千四百一十九户，计有四百九十七辆自行车，二千五百四十个手电筒，一千一百二十个热水瓶，三千五百顶制服帽。现在很多人不愿用手巾扎头了。
    我还到过乡集和庙会。那些地方真是人山人海，卖自行车、胶皮鞋、暖水瓶、手电筒，甚至卖吃卖喝、卖首饰银器的都有，都是生意兴隆。处处看到的景象，简直不是灾年而是丰年了。这里是有浪费的情形在里面的。河北省现在已提出每人每月节约粮食二斤，我以为这是必要和可能的。据估计仅此一项，就可以为国家节约不少粮食，减少许多运输费用。当然除了粮食以外可以节约的地方还是很多的，这就需要进行一次从思想到行动的深入检查，特别需要干部带头倡导。我相信这种风气是可以扭转的。灾区人民在政府的领导和支持下既然已经在生产救灾上取得了胜利，一定也会在节约渡荒上有良好的成绩。
