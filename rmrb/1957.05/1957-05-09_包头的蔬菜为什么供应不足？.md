    In the emerging steel base of Baotou City, as the urban population increases, the vegetable supply situation becomes more strained year by year, especially in the spring. Although the market supply in the first quarter of this year increased compared to the same period last year, the average per capita was only 11.3 jin, which means that each person could only eat two liang of vegetables per day (equivalent to one-sixteenth of the fourth quarter of 1956). In addition, the supply of meat, fish, shrimp, and bean products is also insufficient, which has a great impact on the lives of the people.
    The key problem with the insufficient vegetable supply in Baotou City is that the expansion of vegetable planting area is not adapted to the growth of the population. In 1950, the city's population was only more than 190,000, and in 1956 it had reached more than 600,000. The population has increased more than threefold, while the vegetable planting area has only increased 1.4 times. The lack of vegetable fields, insufficient production and reserves of autumn vegetables, and uneven vegetable supply in winter and spring have led to a severe shortage of vegetables in the spring. In the past, the local area also used the method of purchasing vegetables from other places to supply the city, and more than 3 million jin were purchased in 1956. However, because it is difficult for goods from other places to meet market needs at any time, it is even more difficult to purchase goods when all regions feel insufficient in the spring; and long-distance transportation also causes many losses.
    The fundamental solution to the vegetable supply problem in Baotou City is to develop production in the suburbs and neighboring areas. Although Baotou area has large sandstorms and a relatively cold climate, and the conditions for planting vegetables are poor, as long as the local leaders are determined to expand vegetable fields and vigorously support production, especially expanding the planting area and storage volume of autumn and winter vegetables, it is entirely possible to achieve local production and basic self-sufficiency of vegetables this winter and next spring.

    包头的蔬菜为什么供应不足？
    本报讯　在新兴钢铁基地包头市，随着城市人口的增加，蔬菜的供应情况一年比一年紧张，特别是在春季。今年第一季度市场供应量虽然比去年同期有了增加，但每人平均也只有十一点三斤，也就是说每人一天只能吃到二两菜（只合1956年第四季度的十六分之一）。加之肉类、鱼、虾和豆制品等也供应不足，对群众生活影响很大。
    包头市蔬菜供应不足，关键问题是蔬菜种植面积的扩大与人口的增长不相适应。1950年全市人口只有十九万多，1956年已达六十多万。人口增加了两倍多，而蔬菜种植面积却只增加了一点四倍。菜地少，秋菜的生产储备不足，冬春两季的蔬菜供应又不均衡，就出现了春季蔬菜奇缺的局面。过去当地也曾以向外地采购蔬菜的办法来供应本市，1956年就购进了三百多万斤。但因外地货很难随时满足市场需要，在春季各地均感不足时更难进货；而且长途运输也造成许多损失。
    解决包头市蔬菜供应问题的根本办法，只有发展郊区及其邻近地区的生产。包头地区虽然风沙大、气候较冷，种植蔬菜的条件较差，只要当地领导决心扩大菜田，大力扶植生产，特别是扩大秋冬菜的种植面积和储存量，今冬明春做到蔬菜就近生产、基本自给是完全可能的。
