(A) Various undertakings that should be assigned to local administrative authority

Comrade Liu Shaoqi said in his political report to the "Eighth National Congress": "It is impossible to imagine that in a country as large as ours, the central government can take on all the affairs of the country and do everything well. It is absolutely necessary to delegate some administrative management powers to the local governments. For many of the country's tasks, such as agriculture, small and medium-sized industries, local transportation, local commerce, primary and secondary education, local health services, and local finance, the central government should only propose general guidelines and broad plans, and the specific work should be left to the local governments to deploy and handle according to local conditions and times. Furthermore, some of the cadres of the central organs should be sent to work in the local areas." For example, in 1957, many of the local capital construction projects were built to supply the materials necessary for the central industrial departments. Such as small coal mines, indigenous iron plants, small fertilizer plants, etc., which must rely on local construction, especially some investments that are significantly related to increasing agricultural production (such as water conservancy construction) that need to be undertaken by local governments. Therefore, although local investment has greatly exceeded the proportion stipulated in the First Five-Year Plan, the investment in this area in 1957 will still remain about the same as last year. The central government is now jointly studying and formulating specific plans with local governments, preparing to gradually implement them. In this specific plan, the issue of decentralized management of the planning system can be resolved, because, in order to ensure the implementation of the principle of combining the unity of the national plan with the initiative of the local governments, it is necessary to further study and resolve the current system of undertakings, planning system, and financial system of the country.

(B) Decentralized management in the planning system

According to Comrade Li Fuchun's opinion, the planning system needs to implement decentralized management. The principle of decentralized management is to take into account both centralized unity and adapting to local conditions. All important indicators that require national unified balance should be comprehensively balanced by the State Planning Commission and the State Economic Commission, and included in the national plan after being approved by the State Council, and uniformly issued by the State Council. Local and partial indicators that belong to regional balance or self-balancing by various departments should be balanced and arranged by the provinces (cities), autonomous regions, or various departments according to specific circumstances and conditions, and should also be reported to the State Council for record, so that they can be integrated into the national plan. Other many minor indicators that are numerous and difficult to grasp, and therefore cannot be included in the national plan one by one, should be arranged by local governments or grassroots units themselves, with the state only planning from a broad perspective and adjusting them from the perspective of price policy and supply and marketing relationships. All indicators included in the national plan can be divided into three types, namely, mandatory indicators, adjustable indicators, and reference indicators. If various regions and departments want to modify the mandatory indicators, they must be approved by the State Council; the adjustable indicators can be freely adjusted within a certain range and amplitude specified by the State Council. To adapt to the above methods, certain outdated and inappropriate regulations in the system, procedures, and forms of planning and statistical work should be studied and revised as soon as possible.

(VII) Balance between large and small and medium-sized industries

The previous section mentioned that Comrade Liu Shaoqi in his political report stated that large-scale industries should still be handled by the central government, while small and medium-sized industries should be deployed and handled by local governments according to local conditions and times, and some cadres from the central organs should be sent to work in the local areas. Therefore, it is necessary here to discuss the balance between large and small and medium-sized industries. Large-scale enterprises are the backbone of our country's industrial system, which is indispensable. However, in order to cooperate with the construction and production of large-scale enterprises, to accelerate industrial development, strengthen industrial collaboration, increase the variety of products, and to facilitate the full utilization of resources and the full utilization of existing enterprises, especially joint state-private enterprises, it is necessary to build, renovate, and utilize small and medium-sized enterprises in a planned manner while building large-scale enterprises. Therefore, we have already started construction during the First Five-Year Plan period, and many large-scale industrial enterprises that will be started construction during the Second Five-Year Plan period, which constitute the backbone of our country's complete industrial system, supplemented by many small and medium-sized enterprises, the benefit of which is that in a relatively short period of time, it can increase the production of more industrial products to meet the needs of national construction and people's lives. Let us now discuss in detail:

(A) Debate on the size of enterprises

There are two different and opposing opinions regarding large and small and medium-sized industries. Some believe that building large industrial enterprises is more economically and technically rational, so they advocate building more large enterprises and fewer small and medium-sized enterprises. Others believe that building small and medium-sized enterprises takes less time and yields investment results faster, so they advocate building more small and medium-sized enterprises and fewer large enterprises. Comrade Zhou Enlai, in his report on the proposals for the Second Five-Year Plan, believed that it cannot be generalized. He believed that in certain industrial sectors and under certain conditions, building large enterprises is rational, while in other industrial sectors and under other conditions, building small and medium-sized enterprises is more rational. In each type of enterprise, there should generally be some large enterprises as the backbone, and there should also be many small and medium-sized enterprises to cooperate. When carrying out the construction of large enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises, in order to achieve a combination that can quickly yield investment results in the near future and be more economically and technically rational in the long term, large enterprises that are necessary and possible to be built in phases can be considered for phased construction; small and medium-sized enterprises that have surplus resources and other conditions can conduct comprehensive planning to prepare for future development. At the same time, when planning the cooperation between small and medium-sized enterprises and large enterprises, priority should be given to utilizing the existing small and medium-sized enterprises and handicrafts of state-owned and joint state-private enterprises to unleash their production potential.

(B) Advantages of small and medium-sized industries

A large part of industry, handicrafts, agricultural by-products, and commerce must be decentralized in production and operation. Some of the joint state-private factories should be merged and concentrated in production, but for the country as a whole, most of them must be decentralized in production and operation in accordance with the original conditions or after necessary adjustments. The vast majority of joint state-private factories are factories that manufacture daily consumer goods. People's needs for daily consumer goods are diverse and constantly changing. If many small factories are merged into large factories, they will not be as flexible in adapting to market needs as when small factories are decentralized in production. Taking dyed cloth as an example, according to Vice Premier Chen Yun's opinion, in small machine dyeing factories, a variety can only dye fifty or sixty pieces of cloth, so the colors and varieties can be changed at any time to meet people's needs. However, large machine dyeing factories have a large project to change the production process, so each variety must dye at least three hundred to five hundred pieces of cloth. If all the small factories in our country are merged into large factories, then it will definitely not be able to meet the diverse and constantly changing needs of people's consumption. It should be seen that before liberation, the colors and varieties of consumer goods in our country were no less than they are now, but the factories that manufactured these consumer goods were mostly small factories. Some comrades believe that merging small factories into large factories will increase production, so they are wholeheartedly merging factories. We need a certain number of large factories, because many of the most important industrial products must be produced on a large scale. However, the reason why the output of many daily consumer goods factories increased after the merger is mainly due to the reduction in the variety and specifications of commodities and the simplicity of products. This kind of "rationalization" cannot meet the needs of people's consumption, so we should not encourage this kind of wrong merger. Moreover, some joint state-private enterprises inappropriately disrupted the original production and marketing relationships after the merger. Some repair and service industries did not conduct thorough investigations and studies on their characteristics and summarize their rich experience during the reorganization, and inappropriately concentrated, merged, or changed them to only manufacture but not repair, which made it difficult for citizens' daily furniture and many institutions and schools' cars, scientific instruments, medical equipment, etc., to be repaired, and there were no places to find parts, and some temporary and sporadic orders could not find factories to undertake. The key now is to preserve and absorb all the useful technical heritage among them to fully unleash their potential. We must never measure their importance by the size of the factories. For example, Changchun Huafeng Instrument Factory is famous for manufacturing filter funnels. In 1951, this factory was still privately owned, and it was changed to joint state-private ownership in early 1956. Later, the factory paid attention to improving product quality and reducing product costs, and the filter funnel quickly became a popular and sought-after good product. The output in 1956 was equal to three and a half times that of 1955, but it still could not meet the demand. Why is the "Huafeng" brand filter funnel so popular? The reason is very simple, the quality is good and the price is cheap. The laboratories of two factories in Jilin Province pointed out that they had compared the Huafeng brand with the same imported products, and the filtering effect was the same, but the imported filter funnel was much more expensive in price. However, the factory that produces this famous "Huafeng" brand filter funnel is not a well-equipped modern large factory, it is a small factory with a small scale and simple equipment. There are only twenty-three people in the entire factory, and only seventeen workers are directly involved in production. The factory director sometimes participates in production. There are no service personnel in the factory, and all cleaning and water boiling are shared by the workers themselves. The most valuable equipment in the entire factory is a small machine that is more than two feet high - a vibrating sieve machine, which is worth only seven hundred yuan. Almost all production is manual, so there is no large machine to be seen here. The workers in this factory made high-quality filter funnels under such conditions, which are welcomed by large factories that need filter funnels.

Another example is the Wuxi Joint State-Private Huazhong Shuttle Factory. Although it is a small factory with a small scale, backward equipment, and only fifty-eight employees, it plays a very important role in national construction. Its product - the shuttle - is an indispensable production tool for weaving factories. More than 70% of the shuttles used by textile factories in Jiangsu Province are supplied by this factory. Obviously, the production of this factory is directly related to the production of many textile factories, and it is also directly related to the completion of the textile industry production plan in Jiangsu Province. Therefore, we must never measure the importance of factories and enterprises by their size. As the saying goes: "Pepper is small but spicy, and the weight of a steelyard is heavy." In some cases, things are small, but they have their special functions.

(VIII) Balance between raw material industry and processing industry

There are two imbalances between the raw material industry and the processing industry: (1) Surplus processing industry but insufficient raw materials; (2) Surplus raw materials but insufficient processing industry. Let's discuss them separately now.

(A) Surplus processing industry but insufficient raw materials

The first example is the Yumen Oil Mine, whose task is to strive to produce more oil for the country, do a good job in expansion, and at the same time, support and cooperate with the construction of the Karamay and Qaidam oil fields in all aspects. At present, the entire mine has a certain foundation in terms of workers, equipment, technology, and experience, and transportation conditions have also improved compared to the past, especially the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway has been connected to the mine. Therefore, as long as we make full use of these good conditions and redouble our efforts, we will definitely be able to make more contributions to my country's petroleum industry. However, there is a serious problem in the Yumen Oil Mine, that is, the basic construction materials, mainly steel, cement, and some equipment, cannot be supplied, so the mine has experienced shutdowns and idle work. Although Yumen tried to find alternative materials and find stagnant materials, it was limited after all and could not fundamentally solve the difficulties. However, the shortage of materials is a national problem, and the country is thinking of ways to gradually solve it from all aspects.

The second example is general factories. Their situation is roughly the same. For example, the workers in Hunan, like all the workers in the country, have made great contributions and have produced a large number of new people and new things. However, in the current production, there is a common problem, that is, the supply of raw materials cannot keep up, especially the lack of steel plates and steel, which has caused serious material waiting in some industrial and mining enterprises. Some factories and mines even failed to complete their plans on time and could not improve the quality due to lack of materials. Sometimes it is time to deliver the goods, but where are the materials? I still don't know where it came from. Some workers even cannot start work for several days because there are no materials. Sometimes the factory sends people to various parts of the country to borrow, and it is not easy to wait until the materials are brought, but the plan is about to be overdue. What to do? In order to save time, we can only hurry up! So the lower-level cadres and auxiliary workers rushed up to catch up with the task, working overtime day and night. The consequence of this is poor quality, overwork for workers, and frequent safety accidents. But this problem is not an isolated problem of individual units, but a general problem.

The third example is that there are not enough factories producing steel, so the supply of steel cannot keep up with social needs. According to the opinion of Mr. Sun Dehe, an expert in ferrous metallurgy, my country must build many giant steel bases in the next few years to produce steel, but due to the weakness of my country's past scientific and industrial foundation, there are considerable difficulties. The most critical difficulty is the acquisition of a large number of complex and highly modern heavy metallurgical equipment. A complete steel plant with an output of 1.5 million tons of steel alone requires more than 100,000 tons of equipment. In addition, there are also a considerable number of related mines, thermal power plants, and transportation loading and unloading equipment. Most of the major and complex equipment has to rely on foreign supply. The secondary problem is that the exploration and investigation of many raw material resources require a considerable amount of time. In addition, the selection of factory sites, urban planning, and the gathering of construction forces and materials all require a considerable amount of time. Generally speaking, it takes about one and a half five-year plans. This is really a time that makes people "look forward to wearing out their eyes."

According to Mr. Sun Dehe's opinion, in order to more and faster accelerate my country's steel production, in addition to building giant steel complexes, a large number of medium-sized steel complexes can also be built in my country. These enterprises will make full use of typical designs, use equipment that my country's machinery industry can produce as much as possible, and widely and better organize my country's machinery industry to supply equipment, so that the foundation of these steel enterprises is based on domestic supply to win time and exchange for more steel.

The medium-sized steel complex referred to here refers to a medium-sized complex with an annual output of about 700,000 tons. According to the work experience of the past few years, the equipment of these steel complexes can be produced and manufactured domestically (except for a very small number of equipment or parts that need to be ordered individually from abroad). In terms of design, it can also be undertaken domestically, and most of it uses repeated design and typical design. This can save design time and effort, so that most of the design of a factory can be repeatedly used at the same time in the construction of many factories, and it also creates conditions for simplifying equipment manufacturing. It can use the advantages of batch production by machinery manufacturing factories to improve equipment manufacturing efficiency and speed, and reduce manufacturing costs. If it is proven feasible after detailed research, then in a few years (about three or four years), many similar steel enterprises can be built in batches. He thinks that China has such a large area, and it is not too much to build ten or eight such factories in batches in different regions according to different conditions. These factories are suitable for utilizing local natural resources with smaller reserves, close to users, which can reduce the state's long-distance transportation burden, and for large factories, they can also carry out the division of labor in production varieties and colors. Large steel complexes are needed in my country, but medium-sized complexes are also needed according to different resource conditions and regional conditions. Other countries also have the same situation.

Because the scale of this type of factory is smaller, the difficulties in equipment supply may be less, the resource investigation and research is simpler, the selection of factory sites is also easier, and at the same time, a large amount of typical and reused design is used, the progress is easier to accelerate, which can accelerate socialist construction and strengthen the strength of national defense, because this type of enterprise has reached a considerable scale and has its own economic rationality. The entire production process can also be mechanized and automated as much as possible, and the quality of steel is not inferior to that of giant steel complexes. In addition, due to the use of oxygen-blowing, nitrogen and surplus coke oven gas can also be used for the utilization of chemical fertilizers or other synthetic products. If the phosphorus content of the mineral source is high, phosphate fertilizer can also be produced as a by-product for agricultural production increase.

In terms of light industry, we also feel that the supply of raw materials is insufficient. As everyone knows, most of the raw materials for light industry are taken from agriculture and agricultural by-products. For example, our yarn and cloth is a product with extremely limited raw materials, and our grain supply cannot be said to be very affluent. Therefore, in agricultural production, it is necessary to increase the production of grain, cotton, oil crops, and live pigs as much as possible to meet the needs of people's lives and exports. The People's Daily editorial on February 17, 1957, also said: "The production of the cotton textile industry, the oil industry, the food industry, and other daily necessities industries, except for a few industries, cannot be greatly increased due to insufficient supply of raw materials." This shows the importance of increasing agricultural product production.

(B) Surplus raw materials but insufficient processing industry

The above examples illustrate the problem of surplus processing industry but insufficient supply of raw materials. There are also occasions where the supply of raw materials is surplus but the processing industry is insufficient, which cannot be used as much as possible and causes waste. According to the opinion of an expert, Mr. Lin Wenbiao, in the production process of many factories, although the substances produced in addition to the main products are known to be used to reproduce other products, they are often discarded as waste and not utilized because of inconvenient transportation and the inability of the unit to manufacture other products. For example, ammonium sulfate plants use coke as raw material and discharge a large amount of carbon dioxide gas, and this gas is the raw material for manufacturing chemical products. Because it is not used continuously, it has to be discarded. For example, many smelting plants discharge a large amount of sulfur dioxide without utilizing it. The waste of paper mills can be fermented to produce alcohol, but it has not been well used. Benzene used in the chemical industry is now mostly used as fuel instead of being used to manufacture other organic compounds. There are many similar waste situations, and each enterprise has more or less. In addition, many things are often the waste of this enterprise, or even harmful substances, but for another enterprise, they are the main raw materials that are in great demand and indispensable. For example, marsh gas in coal mines is a dangerous substance that is prone to explosion in mines and affects workers' safety, but it is a valuable and indispensable raw material for manufacturing carbon black, which is greatly needed in the national defense rubber industry. Therefore, carbon black manufacturing plants should be established near mines with high gas content to achieve the purpose of fully processing and utilizing national resources.

(IX) Conclusion

In this paper, I still use the roundabout method to write out the eight representative links in the industry one after another, starting with steel production in heavy industry, and finally ending with steel production, combining the beginning and the end, pointing out a complete industrial system. In this system, the importance of the steel industry is more prominent.

In general, the foundation of a complete system of socialist construction has been established, but there are shortcomings. Comrade Li Fuchun said that the major proportional relationships (i.e., balance relationships) of the national economy in my country's First Five-Year Plan were basically appropriate. The experience and lessons learned in the practice of the first four years of the first five years are very rich. But this does not mean that the arrangements of the annual plan have no shortcomings and errors. If the arrangements are better, the fluctuations between years may be smaller. For example, under the promotion of the socialist upsurge in 1956, all aspects of the national economy have achieved greater development, and the achievements are great. However, the scale of basic construction is too large, more people have been recruited, more students have been recruited, and the wage fund and operating expenses must be increased, resulting in more expenditure by the state finance, and the supply of means of production and consumer goods is tight. On the basis of last year's great development, the plan for 1957 must slow down a step according to the possibility of financial and material resources. This is not a retreat, but a shift to normal development.

The purpose of my writing these two papers is, of course, to help young readers understand the two most important principles of political economy - comprehensive balance and the law of proportionate development. Our planned economy is built on these two principles. Without a planned economy, it is impossible to build our country into a socialist country. In the past few years, young readers have not understood these two principles very well, and some even do not recognize the existence of these principles. This is because the lectures have not been linked to China's reality. Most of the examples cited in the textbooks are foreign examples that are mechanically copied, which sounds unfamiliar and unfriendly, so they feel boring. Because it is boring, some people even do not listen, do not attend classes, and thus draw a conclusion that as long as they focus on business learning, political learning can be put aside, which is a big mistake. If you are going to work in this socialist country in the future, if you have these principles in your mind, you will feel that your work is a part of the whole system, and you yourself are completing socialist construction and are an engineer of socialist construction. How glorious, you will definitely be more enthusiastic, more interested, and more meaningful when you work. This is related to your life, and you must consider it carefully.

In addition, there is a more important point, that is, the dialectical materialism says that things in the universe have internal connections, and we cannot look at the world with isolated, static, and one-sided observations. Therefore, the various aspects, departments, and regions of the national economy are an organically integrated whole. Since things in the universe have internal connections, we can use the roundabout method to write this article, connecting the first and last links together. Otherwise, the connection is impossible. This article was written with this belief. Although there must be many problems, and it remains to be taught by domestic scholars, it is basically successful. After such "practice", my confidence is more firm. Therefore, I disagree with Zhu Xi's statement - "reason is outside the matter", but agree with Wang Chuanshan's statement - "reason is in the matter". (End)

    联系中国实际来再谈谈综合平衡理论和按比例发展规律（续昨）
                                马寅初
    （甲）应划归地方行政职权内的各项事业
    刘少奇同志在“八大”政治报告中说：“不可能
  设想：在我们这样大的国家中，中央能够把国家的各种事务都包揽起来，而且样样办好。把一部分行政管理职权分给地方是完全必要的。国家的很多工作，例如农业、小型和中型的工业、地方的运输事业、地方的商业、中小学教育、地方的卫生事业和地方的财政等等，中央只应当提出一般的方针政策和大体的规划，具体工作应当交由地方因地制宜、因时制宜地去部署办理，并且应当把中央机关的干部分一部分到地方去工作”。例如1957年地方的基本建设，有许多是为供应中央各工业部门必需的物资而建设的。比如小煤窑、土铁厂、小的肥料厂等等，都要依靠地方去兴建，特别是有一部分投资同增加农业生产有重大关系的（如水利建设等）更需要由地方兴办。因此虽然地方投资已经大大超过第一个五年计划所规定的比例，1957年在这方面仍然将保持同去年差不多的投资额。现在中央正在同地方共同研究和拟定具体方案，准备逐步加以实行。在这个具体方案中，计划体制的分级管理问题可以得到解决，因为，为了保证国家计划的统一性同发挥地方的积极性相结合的原则的贯彻执行，必须对国家当前的事业体制、计划体制和财政体制进一步研究和解决。
    （乙）计划体制上的分级管理
    在计划体制上依李富春同志的意见，就需要实行分级管理。分级管理的原则是既要照顾到集中统一，又要照顾到因地制宜。凡需要全国统一平衡的各项重要指标，由国家计划委员会，国家经济委员会综合平衡，并报国务院批准后列入国家计划，由国务院统一下达。地方性的局部性的属于地区平衡或者各部门自行平衡的各项指标，则由各省（市）、自治区或各部门因事因地制宜地自行平衡和安排，同时应报国务院备案，以便经过综合，纳入国家计划。其他许多次要的，种类繁多而情况又不易掌握，因而无法一一纳入国家计划的指标，则由地方或者各基层单位自行安排，国家只从大的方面加以筹划，并从价格政策供销关系上加以调节。凡纳入国家计划中的各项指标，可以分为三种，即指令性的指标，可以调整的指标和参考性的指标。各地区和各部门如要修改指令性的指标，必须经国务院批准；可以调整的指标，则可以在国务院规定的一定范围，一定幅度内自由调整。适应上述办法，计划和统计工作的制度、程序和表格中某些已经过时的，不适当的规定，应该尽快地研究修改。
    （七）大型和中小型工业的平衡
    上节提及刘少奇同志在政治报告中把大型工业仍归中央办理，把小型和中型工业交由地方因地因时制宜地去部署办理，并且把中央机关的干部分一部分到地方去工作。因此在这里有讨论大型和中小型工业的平衡问题之必要。大型企业是我国工业体系的骨干，这是必不可少的。但是为了配合大型企业的建设和生产，为了加速工业的发展，加强工业的协作，增加产品的品种，为了便于充分利用资源，充分利用原有企业，特别是公私合营企业，必须在建设大型企业的同时有计划地新建改建和利用中小型企业。因此我们在第一个五年计划期间已经开工建设，和在第二个五年计划期间将要开工建设的许多规模巨大的工业企业，这就是组成我国完整的工业体系的骨干，同时辅以许许多多中小型企业，其好处是在于在较短的时间内，能够增产更多的工业品，满足国家建设和人民生活的需要。我们现在来详细讨论一下：
    （甲）关于企业规模大小的争论
    关于大型和中小型工业有两种不同的相反的意见，有的认为建设大型工业企业在经济上和技术上比较合理，因此主张多建大型企业，少建中小型企业。又有的因为建设中小型企业需要的时间较短，发挥投资的效果较快，主张多建中小型企业，少建大型企业。周恩来同志在他的第二个五年计划建议的报告中，认为不能一概而论，他认为，某些工业部门和在某种条件下，建设大型企业是合理的，而另一些工业部门和在另一种条件下建设中小型企业就比较合理。在每一类企业中，一般地说都应该有一些大型的企业作为骨干，又应该有许多中小型企业来配合。在进行大型企业和中小型企业建设的时候，为了达到既能于近期内迅速发挥投资效果，又能于远期内在经济上、技术上更为合理的配合，凡是有必要也有可能分期建设的大型企业，可以考虑分期进行建设；凡是资源有余，并且有其他条件的中小型企业，可以进行全面规划，为以后的发展预做准备。同时在规划中小型企业同大型企业相配合的时候，应该首先利用国营和公私合营的原有中小型企业和手工业，以发挥他们的生产潜力。
    （乙）中小型工业有利的方面
    工业、手工业、农业副产品和商业的很大一部分必须分散生产分散经营。公私合营工厂中有一部分是应该合并和集中生产的，但是就全国来说，大部分必须按照原来的状况或加以必要的调整后分散生产分散经营。绝大多数公私合营工厂是制造日用消费品的工厂，人民对日用消费品的需要是多样的，经常变化的。如果把许多小工厂合并成为大工厂，就它们适应市场需要来说，不会有小工厂分散生产的时候那样灵活。以染色布为例，据陈云副总理的意见，在小的机器染厂里，一个品种可以只染五、六十匹布，因此随时可以改变花色品种，适应人民需要。但是大型机器染厂改变生产程序的工程大，因此每个品种至少要染三百至五百匹布。如果我国的小工厂统统并成大工厂，那就决不能适应人民消费方面的多种多样和经常变化的需要。应该看到，解放以前，我国消费品的花色品种，不比现在少，但是制造这些消费品的工厂，绝大部分是小工厂。有些同志认为，把小工厂合并成为大工厂，产量就会提高，因此他们一心一意地合并工厂。我们需要一定数量的大工厂，因为许多最重要的工业产品是必须大规模生产的。然而许多日用消费品工厂，并厂以后产量所以提高，主要的原因是商品品种规格减少，产品单纯的结果。这种“合理化”不能适应人民消费的需要，因此我们不应当鼓励这种错误的合并。且合并后有些公私合营企业不适当地打乱了原有的产销关系。有些修理业服务业，在改组时没有很好地调查研究它们的特点和总结它们的丰富经验，不适当地加以集中、合并或者改为只制造，不修理，这样就使得市民的日用家具和许多机关学校的汽车、科学仪器、医疗器械等等，没有地方修理，缺少零件也没有地方配，一些临时的零星订货也找不到工厂承做。现在的关键是要很好地保存和吸收它们中间一切有用的技术遗产来充分发挥它们的潜力。我们绝不能以工厂的大小来衡量它们的重要与否。例如长春华丰仪器制造厂，以制造滤过漏斗闻名。1951年，这个厂还是私营的，1956年初改为公私合营。以后这个厂注意提高产品质量和降低产品成本，滤过漏斗很快成为畅销的供不应求的好产品。1956年的产量等于1955年的三倍半，但是仍然满足不了要求。为什么“华丰牌”滤过漏斗受到这样的欢迎呢？原因很简单，质量好，价钱便宜，吉林省有两个工厂的化验室指出，它们曾经把华丰牌和进口的同样产品比较，过滤的效果是一样的，在价钱上进口的滤过漏斗贵得多。但生产这种驰名的“华丰牌”滤过漏斗的工厂，不是一个设备优良的现代化大工厂，它是一个规模很小的设备简陋的小工厂。全厂只有二十三个人，直接生产的工人只有十七人，厂长有时还参加生产。厂里没有勤务人员，所有清扫烧水等工作都是由工人自己分担的。全厂最贵重的设备，就是一架两尺多高的小机器——一台震筛机，价值也不过七百元。全部生产，几乎都是手工操作的，所以在这里看不到一架大机器，这个工厂的工人就在这样的条件下做出了质量良好的滤过漏斗，为需用滤过漏斗的大工厂所欢迎。
    另外一个例子是无锡公私合营华钟梭子厂。虽然它是一个规模小，设备落后，只有五十八个职工的小厂，但是它对国家建设却起着很重要的作用，它的产品——梭子却是织布厂必不可少的生产工具。江苏省纺织厂用的梭子有70％以上都是靠这个厂供应的。显然，这个厂的生产，直接关系着许多个纺织厂的生产，也直接关系着江苏省纺织工业生产计划的完成。因此我们绝不能以大小来衡量工厂企业的重要与否。俗语说：“胡椒虽小辣人心，秤锤虽小坠千斤。”在某些情况下，事物虽小，却有着它的特殊作用。
    （八）原料工业和加工工业的平衡
    原料工业和加工工业之间存在着两种不平衡的现象：（一）加工工业有余而原材料不足；（二）原材料有余而加工工业不足。现在来分别加以讨论。
    （甲）加工工业有余而原料不足
    第一个例子是玉门油矿，他的任务是努力为国家生产更多的石油，做好扩建工作，同时，要在各方面支持和配合克拉玛依和柴达木油田的建设。目前全矿的工人、设备、技术和经验，已经有了一定的基础，交通运输条件也比过去改善，特别是兰新铁路已经通到矿上。所以只要我们充分利用这些好条件，加倍努力，一定能够给我国的石油工业做出更多的贡献来。但是玉门石油矿上存在着一个严重问题，就是基本建设的材料，主要是钢材、水泥和一些设备供应不上，因此矿上已经发生了停工和窝工现象。虽然，玉门想办法用代用料和找呆滞料，但是毕竟有限，不能从根本上解决困难。但材料不足是个全国性的问题，国家正在从各方面想法逐步解决。
    第二个例子是一般的工厂。它们的情形亦大致相同。比如湖南的工人和全国所有的工人一样，作出了很大的贡献，涌现出了大批的新人新事。但是，在当前的生产中，普遍存在着一个问题，就是原材料供应不上，特别是钢板和钢材缺乏，以致使有些工矿引起了严重的待料情况。有些厂矿甚至因为没有材料，造成计划不能按时完成，质量提不高的恶果。有时应该交货了，但是材料呢？还不晓得来自那里。有的工人甚至因为没有料子，继续几天不能开工。有时厂里派人到全国各地去拨借，好容易等到材料搞来了，可是计划又快脱期了。怎么办呢？为了争取时间只有赶吧！于是下面的干部，下面的辅助工都轰起来赶任务，日夜加班加点。这样带来的后果是质量不高，工人疲劳过度，安全事故百出。但这个问题不是个别单位的问题，而是带有普遍性的问题。
    第三个例子是生产钢材的工厂不够，所以钢材供应量跟不上社会的需要。依黑色冶金专家孙德和先生的意见，我国在今后若干年内须建成不少个巨型钢铁基地来生产钢材，但由于我国过去的科学与工业基础的薄弱，存在着相当巨大的困难。最关键的困难是大量的复杂与高度现代化的重型冶金设备的取得。一个完整的一百五十万吨产量钢铁联合企业钢铁厂，本身便需要十多万吨的设备，另外还有相关的矿山、热电站、交通运输起卸的设备等等，数量也不少。重大的复杂的设备大部分要依靠国外供应，次要的问题是许多原料资源的勘探与调查研究需要相当长久的时间。此外厂址的选择，城市的规划，以及施工力量与物质的集结均需要相当长久的时间。一般的说，大致需要一个半五年计划的时间。这真是一个使人“望穿秋水”的时间。
    依孙德和先生的意见，为了更多地更快地加速我国钢的产量，除建设巨型钢铁联合企业外，还可以在我国建设数目较多的中型钢铁联合企业。这些企业将尽量利用典型设计，尽量使用我国机械工业可能生产的设备，广泛地更好地组织我国的机械工业来供应设备，将这些钢铁企业的基础放在国内供应的基础上来赢取时间，换取更多的钢材。
    这里所指的中型钢铁联合企业是指的年产约七十万吨左右的中型联合企业。根据几年来的工作经验，这些钢铁联合企业的设备是有可能在国内生产与制造的（除去极端少数的设备或零件需个别向国外订货）。在设计方面国内也是可以承担的，绝大部分利用重复设计与典型设计。这样可以节约设计的时间与力量，使一个厂的设计的绝大部分在好多厂的建设中同时重复利用，也创造了设备制造简化的条件，可以使用机械制造厂成批生产的优点，提高设备制造的效率与速度，减低制造成本。如果经过详细研究之后证明这是可行的，则在几年之内（大约三、四年），可以成批地多建设好多个类似的钢铁企业。他想中国幅员这样大，分批在不同地区根据不同条件建上十个八个这样的厂是不算多的。这些厂适宜于利用当地天然储藏量较小的资源，接近于使用户，可以减少国家长距离的运输负担，对于大厂来说，也可以进行生产品种和花色的分工。大的钢铁联合企业于我国是需要的，但中型联合企业，根据不同的资源情况和地区情况，想起来也是需要的，其他国家也有同样的情况。
    因为这类厂的规模较小，设备供应上困难可能少一些，在资源调查研究方面简单一些，厂址选择也比较容易，同时大量使用典型及复用设计，进度上易于加快，可以加速社会主义建设，可以加强国防的力量，因为这类企业已经达到相当可观的规模，有着本身的经济合理性。整个的生产过程也是可以尽量使用机械化和自动化的，在钢材的质量上和巨型的钢铁联合企业的产品没有逊色的。此外由于采用吹氧气风炼还可以利用氮气与节余焦炉煤气供化工肥料或其他合成产品的利用。如果矿源的含磷高也可附产磷肥供农业增产之用。
    在轻工业方面，我们也觉得原料供应不足，大家知道，轻工业的原料绝大部分取之于农业和农副业。例如我们的纱布是原料极有限制的一种产品，我们的粮食供应也不能说十分富裕，所以在农业生产方面，必须尽可能地增产粮食、棉花、油料作物和生猪来满足人民生活和出口需要，1957年2月17日的人民日报社论也说：“棉纺织业、油脂工业、食品工业和其他日用品工业的生产，除少数行业以外，也因为原料供应不足而不能大量增产。”足见农产品增产的重要性。
    （乙）原材料有余而加工工业不足
    上面几个例子说明加工工业有余而原料供应不足的问题。亦有原材料供应有余而加工工业不足，不能尽量利用造成浪费的场合。据一位专家林文彪先生的意见，很多工厂在生产过程中，除主要产品外所产生出来的物质虽然知道可以用来再生产其他产品，但是由于运输不方便，而本单位又无能力用以制造其他产品时，常常作为废物抛弃，而不加以利用。如硫酸錏厂以焦炭为原料，排出大量二氧化碳气体，而这种气体正是制造化学药品的原料，因为没有连续使用，不得不丢弃。又如许多冶炼厂将大量二氧化硫排出而没有利用。纸厂的废料可再经过发酵制酒精，现在也没有得到很好的使用。化学工业用的苯，现在多是当作燃料用，而没有用以制造其他有机化合物。类似这样的浪费情况是很多的，每个企业或多或少都有的。另外，有许多东西常常是本企业的废物，甚至是有害物，然而对另外一个企业又是需要量大而不可缺少的主要原料。例如煤矿中的沼气是一种在矿井中容易发生爆炸、影响工人安全的危险物质，然而它对制造国防橡胶工业上所大量需要的炭黑，却是一种宝贵不可少的原料。因此在瓦斯量大的矿山附近即应建立炭黑制造厂，以达充分加工利用国家资源的目的。
    （九）结论
    在这篇论文中，我仍用团团转的方法，把工业中有代表性的八个环节，一个接着一个写出来，以重工业中的钢铁生产开始，最后仍以钢铁生产结束，首尾合在一起，指出一个完整的工业体系。在这个体系中钢铁工业的重要性比较突出。
    总的来说，社会主义建设的完整体系的基础已经建立起来了，但有缺点。李富春同志说第一个五年计划中国民经济各个大的比例关系（即平衡关系）基本上是适当的。第一个五年前四年实践中的经验教训是很丰富的。但这并不是说年度计划的安排没有缺点和错误，安排得更好些，年度间的波动可能小点，比如1956年在社会主义高潮的推动下，国民经济各方面都有较大的发展，成绩很大。但是基本建设规模偏大，人员招收多了一些，学生也招多了，工资基金和事业费用也就必须多增加，结果，国家财政多支了一些，生产资料和消费品的供应都紧张。1957年的计划，在去年大发展的基础上，必须根据财力、物力的可能放慢一步，这不是冒退，而是转向正常的发展。
    我写这两篇论文的目的，当然要帮助青年读者理解政治经济学中最主要的两个原则——综合平衡和按比例发展规律。我们的计划经济就建筑在这两个原则之上的。没有计划经济，要把我国建成一个社会主义国家，是不可能的。过去几年中，青年读者对这两个原则不甚了解，因而有的甚至不承认有这些原则的存在，这是由于讲的时候没有联系到中国的实际所致。教本所引证的例子绝大部分是生搬硬套的外国例子，听起来似乎生疏而不亲切，所以觉得枯燥无味。因为枯燥无味，有的甚至不听，不上课，因而得出一个结论，只要重业务学习，政治学习可以丢在一边，这是大错而特错了。你将来在这个社会主义国家做事，在你的脑筋中如有这些原则性的东西存在，你就觉得你的工作是整个体系中的一部分，你本身是在完成社会主义的建设，是社会主义建设的工程师，何等光荣，做起事来，一定更起劲，更有兴趣，更有意义。这是关系你的一生，不可不好好地考虑考虑。
    此外还有更重要的一点，就是辩证唯物论所说的宇宙中的事物都有内在的联系，我们不能用孤立的静止的和片面的观察去看世界，因此国民经济的各个方面，各个部门，各个地区，是一个有机地结合着的整体。宇宙中的事物既有内在的联系，所以我们可以用团团转的方法来写这篇文章，把首尾两个环节联系起来，不然的话，联系是不可能的。这篇文章是本这个信心写出来的。虽然毛病一定很多，有待国内学者的指教，但基本上是成功的。经过这样的“实践”以后，我的信心更坚定。因此我不同意朱羲的说法——“理在事外”，却同意王船山的说法——“理在事中”。（完）
