Beijing to Comprehensively Strengthen Price Management

Since the second half of last year, many commodities in Beijing have been in short supply, and prices have also risen. In addition to commodities such as pork and wool fabrics, which have had their prices adjusted uniformly nationwide, the prices of many commodities have experienced periods of chaos due to insufficient price management by the responsible departments.

After discovering these situations, the Beijing Municipal People's Committee took measures in January of this year to strengthen the management of market prices.

First, manage the prices of free markets. Establish fixed free markets in various districts and manage certain commodities where price increases significantly exceed the limits needed to stimulate production.

Second, strengthen the price management of joint state-private stores, so that the prices of general commodities in joint state-private stores are aligned with the prices of state-owned commercial companies. It is also stipulated that retail departments should generally not purchase goods from other cities or retail departments within the city. Even the main commodities operated by small shops and peddlers must comply with the prices of state-owned commercial companies; minor commodities that are processed and sold retail can be priced slightly higher.

Third, regarding the prices of industrial, handicraft, and state-owned commercial products, it was decided that if profits of both industry and commerce can be balanced, or if costs increase due to increased expenses, wages, and benefits, efforts should be made to save expenses and reduce costs, and price increases are strictly prohibited. For commodities that are indeed losing money, they should be handled according to their importance. Efforts should be made to stabilize the prices of daily necessities that are of great importance to people's lives. Any price increases (including new product pricing) must be approved by the Municipal People's Committee. In addition, the management of scrap markets was also strengthened.

After taking the above measures, some of the chaotic phenomena in market prices have been largely overcome.

However, some problems still exist with prices. Some commodity prices still have phenomena of rising or rising in disguised forms.

For some commodities, although the price has not increased, the quality has decreased. For these commodities with disguised price increases, the government has decided to improve quality or reduce prices. For example, the quality of flour is currently poor, mainly because the wheat suffered from disasters last year, and much of it sprouted. However, in the processing, too much good wheat was mixed with sprouted wheat, which also affected the quality of the flour. It has now been decided to sell flour of too poor quality at a reduced price.

For example, the quality of coal balls has decreased and they do not burn well. This is mainly because the supply of Mentougou coal powder is insufficient, and a portion of Yangquan coal powder is mixed in. In order to improve the quality of coal balls, it has been decided to reduce the amount of Yangquan coal powder mixed in. Hand-cranked coal balls and machine-made coal balls will each be reduced by five cents per hundred catties, and honeycomb coal will be reduced by two to three jiao per hundred pieces, depending on the size.

Many catering establishments have insufficient weights for sesame cakes and fried dough sticks and have increased prices, especially some small businesses that are responsible for their own profits and losses, which is even more serious. Currently, all districts are conducting a general inspection of the catering industry.

The prices of handicraft products and waste products (used as raw materials) have been managed and rolled back, and have basically tended to stabilize.

In addition, Beijing is also further strengthening the management of free markets, and prohibiting illegal acts of raising prices. ·Wang Jing·

### 北京市全面加强物价管理

    北京市全面加强物价管理
    北京市去年下半年以后，市场上很多商品供不应求，价格也有上涨。除猪肉、呢绒等商品在全国统一调整价格以外，有许多商品由于主管部门对市场物价管理不够，价格曾经一度发生混乱现象。
    北京市人民委员会发现这些情况后，在今年1月采取措施，加强了对市场物价的管理。
    首先，对自由市场的物价进行管理。在各区建立固定的自由市场，对价格幅度大大超过刺激生产限度的某些商品，加以管理。
    其次，加强对公私合营商店的物价管理，使公私合营商店一般商品价格，都跟国营商业公司牌价拉平，并且规定零售部门一般的不应该从外埠或本市零售部门进货。连家小铺和小商小贩经营的主要商品，也必须服从国营商业公司的牌价；经过加工整理而零星出售的次要商品，可以稍高于牌价。
    第三，对工业、手工业和国营商业的物价，决定凡能平衡工商双方利润的或因费用、工资福利增加而加大成本的，应该设法节约开支，降低成本，一律不准涨价。确实赔钱的商品，按照商品的主次分别处理，对人民生活关系重大的日用必需品，要力求稳定价格。凡调高价格的（包括新产品新订价），必须一律经过市人民委员会批准。此外，还加强废品市场的管理。
    采取以上措施后，市场物价方面某些混乱的现象基本上克服了。
    但是，目前物价也还存在着一些问题。有些商品价格，还有上涨或变相上涨的现象。
    有些商品，价钱虽然没有上涨，但是质量降低了。对这种变相涨价的商品，政府决定提高质量，或降低价格。例如面粉，目前面粉质量较次，这主要是由于去年小麦受灾，很多都发了芽。但是在加工当中，好麦子掺兑发芽小麦过多，也影响了面粉的质量。现在已决定把质量太次的面粉，降价出售。
    又如，煤球质量降低，不耐烧。主要是因为门头沟煤末供应不足，掺兑一部分阳泉煤末。为了提高煤球质量，已决定少掺阳泉煤末，手摇煤球和机器煤球每百斤各降低五分钱，蜂窝煤按不同的规格，每百块降低二角到三角。
    饮食业有不少的店铺存在着烧饼、油饼分量不足和提高价钱的现象，特别是一部分自负盈亏的小户，更为严重。目前各区正对饮食业进行普遍检查。
    手工业产品和废品（作原料用）价格已进行了管理和压回，基本上趋于稳定。
    此外，北京市还正在进一步加强对自由市场的管理，禁止高抬物价的不法行为。　·王敬·
