Get Rid of Three "Isms" and Work Will Transform
    ——Plant Pathologist Professor Yu Dafu on Rectification
    On the morning of May 13th, Professor Yu Dafu of the Plant Protection Department of Beijing Agricultural University, met with the reporter in his quiet studio as scheduled. Professor Yu Dafu is an outstanding plant pathologist in China and was recently elected as a corresponding academician of the Soviet Lenin Academy of Agricultural Sciences.

    Our topic was about the rectification campaign. He said, "The Communist Party wants people outside the party to offer opinions, which makes me first feel the greatness of the Communist Party, and I feel that there is no distance between me and the Communist Party. Bureaucratism, subjectivism, and sectarianism are indeed problems. Judging from the information reflected from all sides, these problems are universal. Even from the news and articles published in the People's Daily these days, it can be seen very clearly." Professor Yu Dafu mentioned the example in the article "Following the Party, Truth Will Always See the Sun" written by Pang Xunqin, Vice President of the Central Academy of Arts and Crafts, published in this newspaper on May 12th, where the director of the Central Handicraft Industry Administration summoned teaching cadres above the rank of lecturer in the academy and said: "I am a Communist Party member, and I represent the Party... My official position is not big, but it is not small either." Professor Yu Dafu couldn't help but find it funny and said, "What kind of unity is this? But such ridiculous examples are more prominent."

    Professor Yu Dafu talked about his work. He said, "I am an agricultural scientist, and I am more concerned about agricultural production in our country." He believes that all technologies and experiences that can increase agricultural production should be promoted and improved. In the past few years, he has conducted investigations in many places in China. He said, "During the investigation, I once saw that many institutions suffered losses in agricultural production due to bureaucratism and dogmatism. In 1954, when he visited the Xiong Yue Agricultural Experiment Station in Liaoning Province, he saw a high-quality rice variety called "Weiguo" which was developed after many years of effort and was once considered to be related to bourgeois ideology. It was going to be destroyed. The comrade in charge of this work could not bear to destroy it, and secretly found ways to preserve some seeds. Later, those that were preserved proved to be very good and are now being promoted in many places. He said that he encountered similar crude things in other places. "Agricultural science should pay attention to application, but also have a theoretical basis; agriculture has regional and seasonal characteristics, and it also has a close relationship with the local social economy. This is an extremely complex science." Therefore, he believes, "If the leaders of agricultural science commit bureaucratism and dogmatism, it will inevitably bring losses to the country."

   "What about the situations you have directly encountered?" the reporter interjected.

    Professor Yu Dafu pondered for a while, then raised his head: "Well, there is nothing I am currently encountering." He then added: "I personally value professional work more. At Beijing Agricultural University, I have not felt that the leaders of the Plant Protection Department have bureaucratic and sectarian styles, and everyone is united very well. However, the material conditions here are relatively poor, and everyone's potential cannot be brought into full play." Speaking of the relationship between party members and non-party members, he pointed to the room next door and said: "The teaching assistant assigned by the school to help me with teaching and research is a Communist Party member. She has the most contact with me and has been getting along for almost three years. I didn't feel that she was special because she was a party member, and she didn't act restrained because I was a non-party member. She completes everything I ask her to do in a planned way. At the same time, her enthusiasm for work and for people has had a great impact on me. Isn't such getting along very natural!"

    Professor Yu Dafu also works at the Institute of Applied Mycology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. A new administrative deputy director came there and asked him for his opinions on working conditions, and told him that if there are any problems outside of business, I can try my best to help; if there are any problems in business, go to the leader in charge of business. He believes: "This is very good, it can enable us to do research to really do some research." He added: "In fact, the work we do in this institute in one year can be worth several years before." This research institution was established at Beijing Agricultural University in 1953, and it continued to develop. Last year, it expanded from a room to an institute, and needed to move away from the school, and then moved away. Professor Yu Dafu said that he felt very natural about this situation, and did not see any contradiction between the school and the Academy of Sciences, because everyone really "started from work." Now, there are nine professors, associate professors, and lecturers in the Plant Protection Department who also work in this institute.

    It seems that Professor Yu Dafu is relatively satisfied with his current situation. He said: "Based on my current experience, I firmly believe that if the leaders of each unit can consider the nature of the unit, start from work, and think about the interests of the country, they will definitely be able to overcome bureaucratism, sectarianism, and subjectivism. If party members can maintain a sincere and humble attitude and do things seriously, there will be no estrangement between the party and non-party members.

   "What do you think of the rectification campaign that is about to begin?" the reporter interjected again.

    Professor Yu Dafu analyzed the current situation. He said: "Currently, we are required to catch up with the world's advanced scientific level in twelve years, and agricultural production must reach the predetermined targets. This requires giving full play to everyone's enthusiasm. If we don't get rid of the prevalent bureaucratism, subjectivism, and sectarianism, people's enthusiasm will not be brought into play." After a pause, he added: "If we get rid of these three 'isms', we can believe that work will greatly change, and the backward will quickly catch up. The entire country will present a vigorous scene."

    搞掉三个主义，工作会大变样
    ——植物病理学家俞大紱教授谈整风
    5月13日上午，北京农业大学植物保护系俞大紱教授在他安静的工作室，如约接受了记者的访问。俞大紱教授是我国优秀的植物病理学家，最近光荣地当选为苏联列宁农业科学院通讯院士。
    我们的话题是关于整风。他说：“共产党要我们党外的人提意见，这使我首先感觉到共产党的伟大，并且感觉到我和共产党之间没有距离了。官僚主义、主观主义、宗派主义的确是问题。从各方面反映的情况来看，这些问题是有普遍性的。即从人民日报这些天来所刊登的消息、文章，也可以看得很清楚。”5月12日本报刊登的中央工艺美术学院副院长庞熏琴写的“跟着党走，真理总会见太阳”一文中提到，中央手工业管理局局长召集该院讲师以上的教学干部开会时竟然说：“我是共产党员，我代表党……我的官不算大，但是也不小。”俞大紱教授提起这个例子，不禁感到好笑，他说：“这还谈什么团结？不过这样可笑的例子是比较突出的。”
    俞大紱教授谈起自己的工作。他说：“我是一个农业科学工作者，对于我国的农业生产是比较关心的。”他认为凡是对于能够增加农业生产的技术和经验，都应该加以发扬和提高。几年来，他到国内许多地方进行过调查工作。他说“在调查中，我曾经看到，许多机关由于官僚主义和教条主义，使农业生产受到了损失。1954年他到辽宁省的熊岳农业试验场参观，看到一种用了许多年工夫培育成功的水稻优良品种“卫国”号，曾经被认为它同资产阶级思想有关，要把它销毁，主持这项工作的同志不忍心给销毁绝种，暗中设法保留下一些种子。后来，留下来的那些，证明很好，现在已经在许多地方推广。他说，同类粗暴的事情，他还在别的地方遇到过。“农业科学要注重应用，同时也要有理论的基础；农业有地区性和季节性，它和当地的社会经济也有密切的关系。这是一门极复杂的科学。”所以，他认为，“农业科学的领导者，如果犯了官僚主义和教条主义，必然要给国家带来损失。”
   “您直接接触到的情况如何？”记者插问。
    俞大紱教授沉思了一下，然后抬起头：“呃，我目前接触到的情况没有什么。”他接着又说：“我个人比较重视业务工作。在北京农业大学，我还没有感觉到植物保护系的领导者有官僚主义和宗派主义的作风，大家团结得很好。但是这里的物质条件比较差，还不能发挥大家的潜力。”提起党员和非党员的关系。他用手指着隔壁房间说： “学校指定帮助我教学和做研究工作的助教，她就是共产党员。她同我的接触最多，相处快三年了。我没有感到她是党员而有所特殊，她也没有因为我是非党员而行动拘束。我让她做的事情，她都有计划地完成。同时她对工作和对人的热忱态度，无形中给了我很大的影响。这样的相处不是很自然吗！”
    俞大紱教授还在中国科学院应用真菌研究所工作。那里新来一位行政副所长，曾经找他征求对工作条件方面有什么意见，并向他说，业务以外的事，如果有问题，我可以尽力帮忙；业务上有什么问题，就去找管业务的领导。他认为：“这就很好，可以使我们做研究的真的可以做一点研究。”他又补充说： “事实上，我们在这个研究所做的工作一年可以抵上以前几年的。”这个研究机构是1953年起在北京农业大学建立的，不断发展，去年由室扩充成所，需要搬离学校，以后就搬走了。俞大紱教授说，这样的情况他就感到很自然，看不到学校同科学院之间有什么矛盾，原因是大家真的“从工作出发”。现在植物保护系的教授、副教授、讲师共有九人兼这个所里的工作。
    看来，俞大紱教授自己目前遇到的情况都比较满意。他说：“根据我当前遇到的情况来体会，我深信倘使各单位的领导者，能考虑所在单位的性质，从工作出发，从国家的利益着想，一定能克服掉官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义。党员能保持诚恳和谦虚的态度，并认真地做事，党和非党之间就不致有隔膜。
   “您对目前要开始的整风有什么看法？”记者又插问。
    俞大紱教授分析到目前的情况。他说：“目前要求在十二年内赶上世界先进科学水平，农业生产要达到预定的指标。这就要发挥大家的积极性。如果不搞掉普遍存在的官僚主义、主观主义、宗派主义，人们的积极性是发挥不出来的。”停了一下，他又说：“搞掉这三个主义，可以相信工作就会大大变样，落后的会很快赶上去。整个国家将呈现蓬蓬勃勃的气象。”
