    Underground Hydroelectric Power Station

    In the valley of the Gegam Mountains near Yerevan, the capital of the Armenian Republic of the Soviet Union, the Razdan River has been raging for years, but recently this river has disappeared. Now there is an Arzni hydroelectric power station here. It turns out that the river flows through a conduit, along a tunnel, and flows down from a high place onto the blades of the turbine of the hydroelectric power station. This is the product of a new technological idea in the Soviet Union for building hydroelectric power stations.

    The building of this underground hydroelectric power station is not visible from the outside. A huge ten-story reinforced concrete factory building equipped with various machines, control panels, laboratories, and other ancillary workshops is located inside the mountain.

    Building such an underground hydroelectric power station is quite difficult. Initially, a group of geologists explored the interior of the mountain. Then came a group of construction workers, who initially climbed the mountain and removed obstacles with their hands to gain a foothold, and then used simple tools to open up roads, followed by machinery, and finally used bulldozers and dump trucks in the mountain to carry out construction projects.

    The construction of the power station's factory building is also very special. Generally, when building a factory building, the foundation is laid first, and then it is built from the bottom up. But this factory building is completely reversed. The first cubic meter of concrete is not placed on the foundation part of the factory building, but on the roof of the factory building. Finally, the foundation is laid almost near completion. This last part of the project is the most complex and difficult, and the foundation has to be built six meters underwater. River water constantly seeps into the trenches dug for the foundation, and water has to be pumped out day and night. The foundation project was completed on schedule with new technology and the efforts of all construction personnel. (Zhang) (with picture)

    地下水力发电站
    苏联亚美尼亚共和国首都埃里温附近格加姆山的山谷中，经年累月地流着一条汹涌奔腾的拉兹丹河，最近这条河流不见了。现在这里是一座阿尔兹宁水力发电站。原来，这条河流经过导水管，沿着隧道，从高处往下流到水力发电站涡轮机的轮叶上了。这是苏联建设水力发电站新的技术思想的产物。
    这个地下水力发电站的建筑物在外面是看不见的。装设有各种机器、操纵台、实验室以及其他附属车间的十层巨大钢筋混凝土厂房设在山的内部。
    建筑这样一座地下水力发电站是颇不容易的。最初是一批地质学家对山的内部进行勘探。接着来了一批建筑人员，他们起初是爬到山上用双手清除障碍，有了立足之地，然后才使用简单工具，开辟道路，接着用机械，而最后才在山中使用掘土机和自卸卡车，从事建筑工程。
    水力发电站的厂房建筑也是很特别的。一般建筑厂房总是先打地基，而后从下面往上修筑。而这个厂房完全是反过来，第一立方公尺的混凝土不是放在厂房的地基部分，而是放在厂房的屋顶上，到最后，差不多快竣工的时候才打地基。最后这部分工程最复杂也最困难，要在水面下六公尺建筑地基。河水不断地渗入为打地基而掘的壕沟里，要夜以继日地把水抽出去。打地基的工程在新的技术和全体建筑人员的努力下如期完成了。　（章）（附图片）
