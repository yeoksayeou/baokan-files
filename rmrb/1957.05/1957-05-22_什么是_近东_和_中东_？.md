    What are "Near East" and "Middle East"?
    Recently, many readers have written to inquire about the meanings of "Middle East," "Near East," and "Far East." We now provide a brief response as follows:
      The terms "Near East," "Middle East," and "Far East" were originally created by Western Europeans based on their geographical concepts. The easternmost region furthest from Western Europe was called the Far East, including East Asian countries such as China and Japan. The eastern countries closer to Western Europe were called the Near East, including the West Asia and North Africa region and the Balkan Peninsula of Europe – namely Greece, the European part of Turkey, Bulgaria, Albania, and today's Yugoslavia. Shortly before World War I, the Balkan Peninsula was no longer referred to as Near Eastern countries but was usually included in the scope of "Southeast Europe" or "Eastern Europe." At the same time, Europeans called the region between the Near East and the Far East, including Iran, Afghanistan, and India (before the separation of India and Pakistan), the Middle East.
    The explanation of "Middle East" and "Near East" in the Soviet Encyclopedia is roughly the same as the European说法 (version). Specifically, the Near East region includes Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Israel, Egypt, Sudan, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Jordan, Yemen, British colonies and protectorates on the Arabian Peninsula, and the Bahrain Islands. The Middle East region includes Iran and Afghanistan (excluding India and Pakistan). The "Middle East" and "Near East" currently referred to internationally generally refer to the above-mentioned regions, but in many cases, people no longer strictly distinguish between the Middle East and the Near East, often collectively referring to this large area as the "Middle East" or "Near and Middle East," and sometimes including Pakistan and some North African countries.
    Some readers have written to say that the so-called "Middle East" or "Near East" region is actually to the west of our country in terms of direction. Therefore, they believe that we should not follow others in calling these regions the Middle East or Near and Middle East. This is of course reasonable. However, since these names have become internationally accepted geographical terms, and the countries in this region often refer to themselves as "Middle Eastern" countries, there is no need for us to object to the use of these names. Of course, it is more accurate for us to call this region West Asia and North Africa.

### 什么是“近东”和“中东”？

    什么是“近东”和“中东”？
    近来有不少读者来信询问：什么是“中东”、“近东”和“远东”，现简复如下：
      “近东”、“中东”或“远东”这些名称，最初是西欧人根据他们的地理观念而制造出来的。离西欧最远的东方被称为远东，包括中国、日本等东亚国家。靠近西欧的东方国家被称为近东，其中包括西亚北非地区和欧洲的巴尔干半岛——即希腊、土耳其的欧洲部分、保加利亚、阿尔巴尼亚和今天的南斯拉夫。第一次世界大战前不久，巴尔干半岛就不再被人们称作近东国家，而通常被列入“东南欧”或“东欧”的范围。同时，欧洲人把近东与远东之间的地区，包括伊朗、阿富汗和印度（当时印、巴尚未分治），称为中东。
    苏联百科全书上对“中东”和“近东”所作的解释大致和欧洲人的说法相同。具体地说，近东地区包括土耳其、叙利亚、黎巴嫩、以色列、埃及、苏丹、沙特阿拉伯、伊拉克、约旦、也门、阿拉伯半岛上英国的殖民地和保护国以及巴林群岛。中东地区包括伊朗和阿富汗（印度和巴基斯坦不在内）。现在在国际上所称的“中东”和“近东”一般地就是指上述地区，但在很多情况下，人们对于中东和近东已不再加以严格的区分，常常是把这一大片地区统称为“中东”或“中近东”，有时并包括巴基斯坦和北非一些国家。
    有些读者来信说，所谓“中东”或“近东”地区从方向上说，实际上在我国的西方。因此他们认为我们不应该跟着别人称这些地区为中东或中近东。这当然是言之成理的。但是由于这些名称已经成为国际上习惯通用的地理名词，而这个地区的国家也常常自称为“中东”国家，因此我们没有必要反对使用这些名称。当然，我们称这个地区为西亚和北非地区是更为确切的。
