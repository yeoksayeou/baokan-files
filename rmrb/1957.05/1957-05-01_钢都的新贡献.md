    New Contributions from the Steel City
    (Our report) Anshan Iron and Steel Company has undergone arduous and heavy restoration, reconstruction, expansion, and new construction work in recent years. The output of several major products has exceeded or approached more than half of the total national output of such products. From January to April this year, iron ore production increased by approximately 34% compared to the same period last year, pig iron increased by 20%, steel increased by 37%, steel materials increased by 85%, and metallurgical coke increased by 5%.
    This year, the company continues to construct and build over eighty large and small projects.
    Since the beginning of spring, tens of thousands of employees have begun intense construction. For the rebuilt No. 3 blast furnace, workers are currently installing various steel structures day and night. The new sintering plant will soon be put into production. Among the new coke ovens being built to supply coke to the No. 3 blast furnace, three will be put into production this year. The workers responsible for the reconstruction project of the Dong Anshan Iron Mine are breaking rocks and digging mountains in order to build a dedicated railway for this mine. Once all these projects are completed, Anshan Iron and Steel will make a greater contribution to the country's economic construction. (Attached picture)

    钢都的新贡献
    本报讯  鞍山钢铁公司近几年来经过了艰巨繁重的恢复、改建、扩建和新建工作，几种主要产品的产量已超过或接近全国这种产品总量的半数以上。今年1至4月，铁矿石产量大约比去年同期增加34％，生铁增加20％，钢增加37％，钢材增加85％，冶金焦炭增加5％。
    今年这个公司续建和新建厂矿的大小工程仍有八十余项。
    入春以来，数万名职工开始了紧张的建设。改建的第三号高炉，工人们目前正在夜以继日地安装各种钢结构。新烧结厂不久就可以投入生产。为三号高炉供应焦炭而建设的新焦炉中，今年将有三座投入生产。担负东鞍山铁矿改建工程的职工们，正在开山凿石，以便为这个矿山修筑专用铁路。这些工程全部完成以后，鞍钢对国家经济建设将作出更大的贡献。（附图片）
