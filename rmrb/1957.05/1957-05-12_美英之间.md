		Between the US and Britain 	Zhang Tiesheng
		I
		The relationship between the US and Britain is not merely an "alliance" as some of their politicians claim; in reality, there are sharp and deep-seated contradictions. The expansionist policy of US imperialism is aimed at the entire world, but it is primarily directed at the British Empire.
		After the outbreak of World War II, Britain's already weakened economic position deteriorated further. Its economy suffered significant losses during the war; most of its shipping and maritime dominance vanished, its commodity exports sharply declined, and its enormous foreign investments fell into the hands of others. Consequently, it transformed from one of the world's largest creditor nations into one of the world's largest debtor nations. The United States, taking advantage of Britain's weakness, seized its bases, encroached upon its spheres of influence, and established close economic relations with the various entities of the British Empire.
		As soon as World War II ended, the contradictions between the US and Britain became the primary contradictions among imperialist countries. These contradictions were even sharper than those after World War I. In every corner of the capitalist world, the US-British contradictions could be seen almost everywhere. They pervaded the economic, political, and military aspects and could not be resolved by a "joint policy" or "peaceful consultations." So-called agreements were only temporary and localized. New contradictions, conflicts, and struggles often accompanied agreements. Although Britain was a major ally of the US during and after the war, and despite the alignment of US-British international plunder policies, the US loans to Britain in 1945 and the subsequent implementation of the "Marshall Plan" were not so much "aid" to Britain as they were the enslavement of Britain by the US. The establishment of the North Atlantic Alliance further sacrificed Britain's national interests and deprived it of its sovereignty. In effect, postwar Britain had been reduced to a "junior partner" of the United States, especially after the failure of the Anglo-French invasion of Egypt. However, the more the "junior partner" depended on the "senior partner," the sharper the US-British contradictions became.
		II
		First, looking at the economic aspect, the struggle between the US and Britain, whether for sales markets, raw material sources, or investment scope, was intense.
		Obviously, in the struggle for sales markets, US monopoly capital first had to strike at its main competitor, Britain. To protect its market from the encroachment of other capitalist countries—mainly the United States—Britain established the Imperial Preference system to restrict the competition of American goods in the British Empire market. The United States constantly pressured Britain to abolish this preference system, but Britain only made some concessions and refused to abolish it entirely. Britain also organized a Sterling Area, controlling the gold and foreign exchange of its member countries and restricting the import of American goods. The United States launched a fierce offensive against the Sterling Area. The pound was forced to devalue by 30% in 1949, which allowed the US dollar to purchase raw materials from the Sterling Area at a lower price and strengthened the power of US capital exports. The United States not only squeezed Britain out of markets around the world but even penetrated the British Empire itself.
		In the struggle for raw material sources, US and British monopoly enterprises openly fought for oil, rubber, non-ferrous metals, rare metals, sulfur, and wool production areas. When the US invasion of Korea broke out, the US-British competition for military raw materials intensified. The United States reduced its supplies of cotton and sulfur to Britain, which led to a reduction in production in Britain's textile and rubber industries. The so-called "International Materials Conference" in Washington allowed the United States to better control the raw material resources of Britain and other countries in the North Atlantic aggressive bloc. As another example, in the struggle for Middle Eastern oil, in 1945, Britain controlled 19.4 million tons of Middle Eastern oil annually, accounting for 72% of the total Middle Eastern oil production, while the United States only controlled 5 million tons, accounting for 18%. By 1954, the annual Middle Eastern oil production controlled by the United States had reached 80 million tons, accounting for 60% of the total Middle Eastern production, while Britain only controlled 45 million tons, accounting for 33%. That is to say, in ten years, Britain's oil production only increased by a little more than double, while the United States increased by fifteen times. Due to the United States' squeezing out of Britain, Britain's leading position in Middle Eastern oil had been replaced by the United States long before the Suez Canal issue occurred.
		At the same time, the US and Britain were engaged in an intense struggle for investment scope. In just five years from 1945 to 1950, US direct investment in Australia and the Union of South Africa increased from £257 million to £463 million. As a result of the United States strengthening capital exports to Commonwealth countries, London believed that it was not eliminating the "dollar deficit" of these countries but eliminating Britain's influence in these countries. London's "Economist" magazine once pointed out: "If the economic development of various countries (referring to the British Empire) mainly depends on US appropriations, their friendship and cooperation will not remain the friendship and cooperation of the British countries for long."
		From a political or strategic perspective, Britain has never had an enemy who has dealt it such severe blows as its American friend, and who has nibbled away at its empire piece by piece.
		Canada has, in effect, changed from a British dominion to an American dominion. Britain's Pacific dominions, Australia and New Zealand, have also been encroached upon by the United States. The US, Australia, and New Zealand Security Treaty, signed in 1951, simply excluded Britain. The United States also signed a mutual defense assistance agreement with Pakistan (1954), taking a big step into this member of the British Commonwealth. The United States' expansion of its territory in Southeast Asia and the Pacific also means a reduction of Britain's power in the Far East. Japan, which was once a British ally against the United States before the war, has been controlled solely by the United States after the war.
		When World War II ended, Britain still held an advantage in the Middle East, holding control over Egypt, Palestine, Jordan, Iraq, Iran, Greece, and Cyprus, and due to France's weakening, also held such a position in Syria and Lebanon. However, since the United States announced the Truman Doctrine in 1947, the balance of power between the US and Britain in the Middle East has undergone significant changes. After gaining a foothold in Greece and Turkey, the United States then incorporated Israel into its sphere of influence. In Iran, under the pretext of supporting Britain, the United States used double pressure to force the Zahidi government to sign a new oil agreement, and as a result, Britain abandoned its exclusive domination, and 40% of Iranian oil fell into the hands of the United States. In Iraq, the alliance treaty signed by Britain and Iraq in 1930 could not maintain Britain's exclusive domination. In 1954, Iraq not only signed a secret "military assistance" agreement with the United States but also accepted a US "military survey team." After the failure of the Anglo-French invasion of Egypt, the United States took the opportunity to put forward the "Eisenhower Doctrine," taking advantage of the fire to rob, attempting to replace Britain and France's colonial positions in the Middle East. Isn't it true? Now the United States is openly interfering in Jordan, which has just driven out British influence.
		It is noteworthy that the American political commentator Lippmann sang a lament for Britain: "Britain is in the early stages of adapting itself to its new role in the world, which has become necessary due to the unfortunate events of Suez. ... The British are used to living in big houses, and now it is discouraging for them to squeeze into a rather small house. It must be done, and it will be done, but it is not a happy thing."
		III
		However, Britain is not resisting this "unhappy" encroachment without resistance. It has launched a tenacious struggle to resist the power of American monopoly capitalists in international trade and stubbornly tried to maintain and consolidate its position in the British Empire market. The purpose of Britain's formulation of the "Colombo Plan" is to strengthen economic expansion and resist the "Truman Point Four Plan," resisting US capital invested in Southeast Asian countries. At the same time, on the issue of trade between Britain and China, on the issue of Britain protecting imperial preferences, and protecting the Sterling Area against the US dollar, we can see the fierce struggle Britain is conducting against the United States.
		In addition to the economy, British imperialism is also constantly resisting or striking at the offensive of US imperialism in politics and militarily, attempting to restore the position of the British Empire. In Western Europe, Britain has refused to participate in the "Schuman Plan," refused to participate in the "European Federation," and refused to participate in the "European Army." Britain has always had the intention of striving for the leadership of Western Europe. It once promoted "United Europe" but opposed the United States "unifying Europe." When the "European Defense Community" plan went bankrupt, Britain also wanted to use this opportunity to seize the leadership of European affairs. Even after the failure of Britain's invasion of Egypt, Britain still attempted to establish an all-encompassing European Parliament to obtain its leading position in Europe. In the Far East, the US and Britain have openly acknowledged in official documents on their common policies that their opinions are "divided on the China issue." Even regarding the United States' plan to establish a military structure for the Southeast Asian aggressive bloc under its control, Britain also felt that this was unfavorable to it. The emergence of the Southeast Asian aggressive bloc has not concealed the signs of US-British hegemony in Southeast Asia. In the Middle East, after the "Middle East Command" plan went bankrupt, in order to deal with the United States gradually piecing together the Middle East aggressive bloc and squeezing out the activities of Britain and France, after the Turkish-Pakistani military agreement and the Turkish-Iraqi military treaty were successively established, Britain tried to squeeze into this system, and the Baghdad Pact of Britain, Turkey, Pakistan, Iran, and Iraq was established. However, the United States can manipulate this treaty behind the scenes through extensive "aid" to Middle Eastern countries.
		Recently, due to suffering a "severe" blow in the invasion of Egypt, Britain cannot but rely more on the power of the United States to protect its colonial interests, but on the other hand, it is trying to resist the squeeze or oppression of the United States and gradually seek recovery. This can also be seen in the Bermuda Conference and after the conference. As far as we know, as a result of the Bermuda talks, the US and Britain reached a certain compromise. However, this compromise mixed with contradictions is obviously temporary, localized, and limited, while the US-British contradictions are still comprehensive, long-term, and sharp. The Bermuda Conference not only failed to solve the US-British problems in the Middle East, but also failed to solve their problems in Western Europe. After the conference, Britain resolutely issued a defense white paper, announcing the reduction of conventional military equipment, the implementation of its own military plan, and the withdrawal of some British troops stationed in West Germany within a certain period. This has caused great dissatisfaction in the United States.
		Now Britain has issued a call to "restore leadership," which is aimed at the United States. In order to strengthen Anglo-French relations to confront the United States, the British Queen recently visited France. On the issue of requesting "relaxation" of the "embargo" on China, Britain has once again united with France, Japan, and other countries in fighting the United States. At the same time, Britain is working hard to adjust relations within the Commonwealth to resist the United States' offensive against the imperial position. It is obvious that the contradictions and struggles between the US and Britain will not weaken in the future but will develop.

    美英之间	　张铁生	一
    美英之间，并不是像它们的一些政客所说的只是一种“联盟”关系，实际上存在着尖锐而深刻的矛盾。美帝国主义的扩张政策乃以全世界为对象，但首先针对着的却是英帝国。
    当第二次世界大战爆发以后，英国已经削弱的经济地位更加削弱了。它的经济在战争期间遭受了重大的损失，大部分航运及海上霸权归于乌有，商品的输出急剧地减少，巨大的国外投资纷纷落入别人的掌握之中，因此它由世界上一个最大的债权国一变而为世界上一个最大的债务国。而美国则利用英国削弱的机会，夺取了它的基地，侵入了它的势力范围，并且和英帝国的各单位建立了密切的经济关系。
    第二次世界大战一结束，美英矛盾在帝国主义国家相互间的矛盾里成了主要的矛盾。它比第一次世界大战以后的矛盾更加尖锐。在资本主义世界的各个角落上，差不多到处都可以看出美英矛盾，而且它遍及于经济的、政治的及军事的各方面，并不能用“联合政策”或“和平协商办法”来解决。所谓协议只是临时性的，局部性的。伴着协议而来的常常是新的矛盾、冲突和斗争。尽管英国在战时和战后都是美国的主要盟国，尽管美英的国际掠夺政策有一致的方面，可是1945年美国对英国的借款以及此后“马歇尔计划”的实行，与其说是美国对英国的“援助”，毋宁说是美国对英国的奴役。北大西洋联盟的成立，使英国进一步牺牲掉民族利益，丧失掉主权。在事实上，战后英国已降为美国的“小伙计”了，尤其是在英法以侵埃战争失败以后。不过，“小伙计”对“大伙计”愈依赖，则美英矛盾却愈尖锐。	二
    先从经济方面来看，无论争夺销售市场、原料产地或投资范围，美英的斗争都是剧烈的。
    显然，在争夺销售市场的斗争中，美国垄断资本首先要打击的就是它的主要竞争者英国。英国为使其市场免受其它资本主义国家——主要是美国的侵犯，建立了帝国优惠制来限制美国货物在英帝国市场上的竞争。美国曾不断逼迫英国取消这种优惠制，但英国只作一些让步，不肯取消。英国还组织了一个英镑区，管制其中国家的黄金和外汇，并限制美国商品的输入。美国曾对英镑区展开了疯狂的进攻，英镑在1949年曾被迫贬值30％，这可使美元能以低价购买英镑区的原料，同时可加强美国资本输出的力量。美国不但在世界各地的市场上排挤英国，甚至侵入到英帝国内部。
    在争夺原料产地方面，美英的垄断企业公开进行斗争，争夺石油、橡胶、有色金属、稀有金属、硫磺和羊毛的产地。当美国侵朝战争爆发以后，美英对军事原料的争夺更加剧烈。美国曾在棉花和硫磺方面减少了对英国的供应，因而使英国的纺织和橡胶工业减产。而设在华盛顿的所谓“国际原料会议”，却使美国更能支配英国及北大西洋侵略集团其它国家的原料资源。又如在中东石油的争夺上，1945年，英国所掌握的中东石油年达一千九百四十万吨，占中东全年油产量的72％，而美国却只有五百万吨，占18％；到了1954年，美国所掌握的中东石油年产量已达八千万吨，占中东全年产量的60％，而英国却只有四千五百万吨，占33％。这就是说，在十年内，英国的油产量只增加了一倍多，而美国却增加了十五倍。由于美国对英国的排挤，英国在中东石油方面所占有的领导地位，在苏伊士运河问题发生以前早已被美国取而代之。
    同时美英又进行着争夺投资范围的剧烈斗争。仅仅在从1945年到1950年的五年内，美国在澳大利亚及南非联邦的直接投资已从二亿五千七百万英镑增加到四亿六千三百万英镑。美国向英联邦各成员国加强资本输出的结果，伦敦认为不是消灭这些国家的“美元赤字”，而是消灭英国在这些国家里的势力。伦敦的“经济学家”杂志曾经指出：“如果各国（指不列颠帝国）在经济上的发展主要是依赖美国的拨款，它们的友谊合作就不会长久依旧是不列颠各国的友谊合作。”
    再从政治方面或战略方面来看，英国从来没有一个敌人像它的美国朋友那样给它这么严重的打击，并且从它的手中把它的帝国一片片地蚕食了去。
    加拿大在实际上已从英国自治领的地位变成美国自治领。英国在太平洋上的自治领澳大利亚和新西兰，又被美国侵入了，在1951年签订的美、澳、新三国安全条约把英国干脆排斥在外。美国还同巴基斯坦签订共同防御援助协定（1954年）而大踏步地侵入了英联邦的这一成员国。而美国在东南亚，在太平洋的地盘的扩张，也意味着英国在远东的势力的缩小。战前曾作为英国盟国而对抗美国的日本，战后却被美国单独地控制着。
    当第二次世界大战结束的时候，英国在中东仍占优势，它在埃及、巴勒斯坦、约旦、伊拉克、伊朗、希腊及塞浦路斯岛本占有控制的地位，并且由于法国的剥弱而在叙利亚和黎巴嫩也占有这样的地位。可是，从1947年美国的宣布杜鲁门主义开始，美英在中东的势力已发生了很大的变化。美国在伸足于希腊及土耳其以后，接着又把以色列并入了它的势力范围。在伊朗，美国以支持英国为借口，以双重压力逼迫萨希迪政府签订新的石油协定，结果英国放弃了独霸的局面，伊朗石油有40％落入美国的手中。在伊拉克，英伊在1930年签订的同盟条约也不能保持英国独霸的局面。1954年，伊拉克不仅同美国签订了秘密“军事援助”协定，而且接受了美国的“军事调查团”。在英法侵略埃及失败以后，美国乘机抬出了“艾森豪威尔主义”，趁火打劫，企图取英法在中东的殖民地位而代之。不是吗？现在美国又对那刚赶走英国势力的约旦公开进行干涉了。
    耐人玩味的是，美国政论家李普曼替英国唱了一支哀歌：“英国正处在使自己适应它在世界上的新地位的初期，这是由于苏伊士不幸事件而成为必要的。……英国人过去住惯了大房子，现在要他们挤在一所相当小的房子里，这种前景是令人丧气的。必须这样做，也要这样做，但这并不是开心的事。”	三
    可是，英国对于这种“不开心”的进逼并不是无抵抗的。它曾展开顽强的斗争来抵抗美国垄断资本家在国际贸易上的势力，而且倔强地力图保持并巩固它在英帝国市场上的地位。英国制订“科伦坡计划”的目的，就在加强经济上的扩张并抵制“杜鲁门第四点计划”，抵制美国投在东南亚各国的资本。同时，在英国和中国贸易的问题上，在英国保护帝国优惠制，保护英镑集团反对美元的问题上，都可以看出英国对美国进行的激烈斗争。
    除经济外，英帝国主义在政治及军事上也不断抵制或打击美帝国主义的进攻而力图恢复英帝国的地位。在西欧方面，英国曾拒绝参加“舒曼计划”，并曾拒绝参加“欧洲联邦”，又拒绝参加“欧洲军”。英国一向有争取西欧领导权的企图。它曾宣传过“统一欧洲”，但反对由美国来“统一欧洲”。当 “欧洲防务集团”计划破产以后，英国也曾想利用这个时机来夺取关于欧洲事务的领导权。就是在英国侵埃战争失败以后，英国还企图成立一个无所不包的欧洲议会以取得它在欧洲的领导地位。在远东方面，英美曾在关于它们共同政策的官方文件上公开承认它们的意见“在中国问题上有分歧”。就是关于美国建立它所控制的东南亚侵略集团军事机构的计划，英国也曾感觉到这对它是不利的。东南亚侵略集团的出现，并没有遮掩住英美在东南亚争夺霸权的迹象。在中东方面，自“中东司令部”计划破产后，为着对付美国逐步拼凑中东侵略集团，排挤英法的活动，在土巴军事协定，土伊军事条约先后成立以后，英国曾设法挤进这个体系，而成立英国、土耳其、巴基斯坦、伊朗、伊拉克的巴格达条约。不过，美国却可通过对中东国家的广泛“援助”，而在背后操纵着这个条约。
    最近，由于在侵埃战争中遭受了“严重”打击，英国不能不更依赖美国的力量来保护它的殖民利益，但另一方面它却设法抗拒美国的排挤或压迫而徐图恢复。这就在百慕大会议上及会议后也可以看出。据我们所知道的，百慕大会谈的结果，美英是取得一定妥协的，不过，这种夹杂着矛盾的妥协显然是临时性的，局部性的，有限性的，而美英矛盾却仍然是全面性的，长期性的，并且是尖锐的；百慕大会议不仅没有解决掉美英在中东的问题，而且没有解决掉它们在西欧的问题。英国在会议后坚决发表国防白皮书，宣布裁减常规军备，实行自己的军事计划，并在一定时期内撤退驻在西德的若干英军。这已引起美国很大的不满。
    现在英国发出了“恢复领导地位”的呼声，这是对美国表示的。为了加强英法关系来对抗美国，英女王最近访问了法国。在要求“放宽”对中国“禁运”的问题上，英国又联合法、日等国在同美国斗争。同时英国在努力调整英联邦内部的关系，以抵抗美国对帝国阵地的进攻。显而易见，今后美英之间的矛盾和斗争并不是在减弱，而是在发展。
