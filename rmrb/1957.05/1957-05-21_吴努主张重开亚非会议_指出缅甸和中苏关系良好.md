Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 20th: According to TASS, Moscow, May 20th, Burmese Prime Minister U Nu, in a conversation with a special correspondent from "Spark" magazine, advocated holding a second Asian-African Conference. The full text of this conversation will be published in the latest issue of "Spark" magazine.

U Nu said, "However, I do not think that this matter must be put into practice immediately. Some countries are currently busy with internal affairs. Therefore, it is best to wait a while longer so that the new conference can have the same representativeness as the first conference."

When the reporter asked Prime Minister U Nu what he considered the most important event in his life, U Nu replied: "Burma's attainment of independence."

Speaking about Burma's construction, U Nu said that the completion of the new national four-year development plan would bring Burma a big step closer to this goal.

Regarding the prospects for political, economic, and cultural cooperation between Burma and the Soviet Union, the Burmese Prime Minister said that despite the different political systems of Burma and the Soviet Union, there is a full basis for further developing political cooperation between the two countries because our two countries pursue the same principles of foreign policy. He said that as for the economic cooperation between our two countries, the future is very bright. He pointed to the example of Soviet agricultural experts helping Burma solve many agricultural problems. He also gave the same good assessment of the prospects for cultural cooperation between the two countries.

U Nu also pointed out the good development of relations between Burma and China.

The Burmese Prime Minister expressed his views on the issue of disarmament, saying: "Disarmament is a must. No disarmament means war, there is no other way."
