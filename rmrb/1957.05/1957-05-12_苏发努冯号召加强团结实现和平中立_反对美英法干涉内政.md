Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 10th: According to a broadcast from Vientiane Radio on the 9th, Prince Souphanouvong, leader of the Lao Fighting Forces, issued a statement on April 30th protesting the notes from the United States, Britain, and France to the Royal Lao Government on April 16th, which interfered in Laos' internal affairs and endangered Laos' national sovereignty.

Souphanouvong said that the Western countries' notes are new and obvious evidence of the long-standing conspiracy, especially by the United States, to maintain tension and obstruct national unification and reconciliation in Laos.

Prince Souphanouvong also said that the Lao Fighting Forces have always strictly implemented the Geneva Accords and continue to hold negotiations with the Royal Government in order to specifically implement the agreements already reached.

Souphanouvong called on all Lao people to work together to support the Royal Government, to fight together with the Royal Government against any foreign interference, to implement a policy of peace and neutrality, to implement all agreements already reached, and to defend the motherland, religion, the royal family, and to cherish their own nation.

Prince Souphanouvong finally expressed his hope that all peace-loving people and governments in the world would support the just struggle of the Lao people, and hoped that the International Commission would continue to firmly assist in enabling the negotiations between the two sides in Laos to continue and be successfully completed, and that the agreements could be correctly and fully implemented.

    反对美英法干涉内政
    据新华社河内10日电　据万象电台9日广播，寮国战斗部队领袖苏发努冯亲王曾经在4月30日发表声明，抗议美、英、法三国4月16日给老挝王国政府的照会干涉老挝的内政和危害老挝的国家主权。
    苏发努冯说，西方国家的照会是长时间以来特别是美国所进行的、目的在于维持紧张局势和阻挠老挝全国统一与和解的阴谋的一个新的明显证据。
    苏发努冯亲王还说，寮国战斗部队始终严格执行日内瓦协定并且继续同王国政府举行谈判，以求具体执行已经达成的协议。
    苏发努冯号召老挝全体人民协同努力支持王国政府，同王国政府一起进行斗争，反对任何外国干涉，实现和平中立政策，执行所有已经达成的协议和保卫祖国、宗教和王室以及爱护自己的民族。
    苏发努冯亲王最后表示希望世界上所有爱好和平的各国人民和政府将支持老挝人民的正义斗争，希望国际委员会将继续坚决地予以协助以使老挝双方的谈判得以继续进行而胜利完成，协议得以正确和充分执行。
