Qinyuan Chun

Farewell to Chairman Voroshilov's Return

An old man comes from afar, everyone rejoices and the whole country is ecstatic.
Rejoicing in the people's friendship, close as brothers; Sino-Soviet unity, as solid as a golden city.
Enjoying the scenic southwest, gathering the customs of the northeast, love as deep as the sea pours in all directions.
Again moving the sails, to allow the people of friendly countries to share the auspicious light.
Joyfully coming again, to promote the good cause of peace.
Look at the majestic mountains and rivers, red flags shining; the alliance is as firm as gold and stone, hydrogen bombs disappear.
The banquet is in full swing, the farewell song is sung, the fragrant breeze from the sky sends you home.
We wish together, to create boundless happiness for all mankind!

    沁园春
    欢送伏罗希洛夫主席元旋
  　李济深一老遥临，万众欢腾，举国若狂。喜人民友爱，亲如兄弟；中苏团结，固若金汤。揽胜西南，采风东北，海样深情注四方。复移斾，俾友邦士庶，共挹祥光。重来喜气洋洋，克展布和平好主张。看气壮山河，红旗焕彩；盟坚金石，氢弹销芒。燕俎方酣，骊歌乍唱，天际熏风送返航。同声祝，更为全人类，造福无疆！
