　　(Comprehensive report from this newspaper) Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Paris: Prominent Algerian pro-French politician Ali Chekkel was assassinated in Paris on the 26th and died. He was shot dead after leaving a football match and getting into his car. The assassin was arrested on the spot.
　　Chekkel had been "elected" as a member of parliament every year since the French established a "National Assembly" in Algeria in 1948. Before this assembly was dissolved by the French last June, he had served as vice-speaker several times. He was also a member of the French delegation to the United Nations debate on the Algerian question. Because he has always been enthusiastic in promoting the French saying that "Algeria is a province of France," he has long had a very bad reputation among Algerian patriotic people.
　　At dawn on the 27th, hundreds of armed police conducted a large-scale search in the North African residential area of ​​Paris, attempting to find "accomplices" related to the Chekkel assassination. Approximately one thousand people were taken to the police station for further interrogation.
　　According to the police, the Algerian youth Ben Sadok Mohammed, who was arrested on the spot after the assassination on the 26th, said that he killed Chekkel voluntarily because Chekkel was "the last friend of the French in Algeria." He also said that he did not belong to any political organization. Ben Sadok has been charged with "intentional homicide and endangering domestic security."
　　Sources say that the Chekkel assassination caused "shock" in the French upper class.

    阿尔及利亚亲法政客歇卡勒
    在爱国者枪下横尸巴黎街头
    巴黎警察大肆搜捕市内的北非人
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：巴黎消息，阿尔及利亚著名亲法政客阿里·歇卡勒26日在巴黎遇刺身死。他是在观看足球赛之后离场登车之际被人用枪打死的。刺客当场被捕。
    歇卡勒自从1948年法国人在阿尔及利亚设立“国民议会”以来，就一直连年被“选”为议员。到去年6月这一议会被法国人解散之前，他曾经数度担任过副议长。他又是上次参加联合国关于阿尔及利亚问题辩论的法国代表团成员之一。由于他一贯热心替法国宣扬关于“阿尔及利亚是法国一省”的说法，因此长期以来在阿尔及利亚爱国人民中名声很坏。
    27日黎明数百名武装警察在巴黎市内北非人居住区进行大搜查，企图寻获同刺死歇卡勒案件有关的“同谋者”。大约有一千人被押往警察局作进一步的审问。
    据警察局方面宣布，26日在行刺后当场被捕的阿尔及利亚青年本·萨多克·莫罕麦德说，他是自动杀死歇卡勒的，因为歇卡勒是“法国人在阿尔及利亚的最后一个朋友”。他还说他不属于任何政治组织。本·萨多克已经被控犯了“蓄意杀人和危害国内治安”罪。
    有消息说，歇卡勒被刺案在法国上层社会中引起了“震惊”。
