Dai Songen spoke on the issue of developing genetics in China. He said that the reason why genetics had not been developed in China was that before liberation, there were not many people who specialized in studying and researching genetics; after liberation, sectarianism and dogmatism appeared in the study and research of genetics. Some leading comrades, who themselves did not understand genetics, replaced genetics with philosophical concepts, treated genetics with a closed-door approach, and handled disputes in genetics as if they were dealing with contradictions between ourselves and the enemy. Based on philosophical concepts, they divided genetics into materialistic and idealistic, forming two opposing genetics (i.e., Michurin genetics and Morgan genetics), and did not see that some facts had already played a huge role in increasing production. For example, corn double-cross hybrids have long been used on a large scale in production in the United States, playing a huge role in increasing production (generally an average increase of 65%). Since the agricultural delegation headed by Minister Matskevich visited the United States, the Soviet Union has learned from their experience and is vigorously carrying out research and hybrid seed production in this area, striving to plant double-cross hybrid seeds in all cornfields in the Soviet Union before 1960. These leading comrades also did not distinguish between genetics and "eugenics" (i.e., "racial improvement"), believing that "eugenics" was reactionary, and therefore genetics was also reactionary. I believe that genetics itself is a purely theoretical discipline and has no class character.

He said: In fact, both so-called Morgan and Michurin genetics are very young. The former has only been around for fifty years or so, and the latter for only twenty years. These two genetics are still developing, and the laws in many aspects have not been fully explored. It is difficult to say which one is completely right and which one is completely wrong, nor should it be said that Michurin genetics is integrated with practice. Especially with regard to the integration with practice, this may prompt some leading comrades to still believe today that Morgan genetics is divorced from reality and that the "gene" theory is unfounded and therefore idealistic. The cooperation between the Institute of Genetics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the North China Agricultural Science Research Institute may also stem from this point of view. I don’t think this cooperation is good for the development of genetics. In fact, the development of natural science has its relative independence and cannot be regarded as the entire development of natural science being directly determined by production development and economic development. We must recognize the significance of the development of scientific ideas of the previous generation and recognize the active role of ideas in social life. As Engels said: "As long as natural science is thinking, its form of development is hypothesis." The "gene theory" in Morgan genetics is a hypothesis, and the "plasticity substance" in Michurin genetics is also a hypothesis. The purpose of both sides is to develop genetics, but why insist that the "gene theory" is an unfounded, idealistic, and even reactionary one!

The "Hundred Schools of Thought" policy has saved genetics. Since the Qingdao Genetics Symposium jointly held by the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Ministry of Higher Education last year, many geneticists have dared to speak out and clarified that the two genetics have their own strengths and weaknesses and each has its own bias. The Morgan genetics school has obtained many valuable results in genetic material basis, polyploidy, artificial mutation, quantitative genetics, and self-crossing breeding; the Michurin genetics school has also obtained many valuable results in directional cultivation, asexual hybridization, the creativity of selection, rejuvenation within and between varieties, and stage development analysis. From these results, it can be seen that each side has its own strengths.

Dai Songen suggested that both sides should humbly learn from each other, learn from each other's strengths, overcome sectarianism in genetics, and continue to accumulate scientific data to enrich China's genetics. He said, of course, in the end there will only be one kind of genetics, because there is only one truth.

Finally, Dai Songen also put forward some specific suggestions on developing genetics in China. He hoped: (1) To relieve geneticists of unnecessary administrative duties and social activities. (2) To quickly prepare for the establishment of an Institute of Genetics on the basis of the Institute of Genetics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and establish an Academic Committee of Genetics. Under unified leadership, organize domestic geneticists from both sides and incorporate their main research topics into a unified plan; the Chinese Academy of Sciences should support them as much as possible in terms of manpower, material resources, and financial resources in a planned way. (3) Starting from the autumn semester of this year, Morgan genetics and Michurin genetics should be taught in universities and colleges, and given equal treatment. (4) In the future, when newspapers and periodicals report on the dynamics of genetic research, they must never promote the Morgan school or the Michurin school in this way, so as to avoid aggravating unnecessary opposition; they should focus on publicizing the research situation of a certain geneticist, or publicizing what research results which geneticists have obtained for a certain genetic research problem, and what different opinions they have. Only in this way can academic debates be launched and a true school of thought be gradually formed, developing genetics in the continuous process of debate and unity of contradictions. (5) The Chinese Academy of Sciences will select and appoint one or two geneticists to participate in the Department of Biology next year to play an academic leadership role in genetics.

    在争论中形成真正的学派
    戴松恩建议两种遗传学互相学习取长补短
    戴松恩就发展我国遗传学的问题作了发言。他说，遗传学在我国没有得到发展的原因，解放前是由于专门学习和研究遗传学的人不太多；解放后是由于遗传学的学习和研究中出现了宗派主义和教条主义。有些领导同志自己不懂遗传学，却以哲学的概念来代替遗传学，以关门主义的做法来对待遗传学，并且以处理敌我矛盾的办法来处理遗传学中的争论。他们根据哲学上的概念把遗传学划分为唯物的和唯心的，形成两种对立的遗传学（即米丘林遗传学和摩尔根遗传学），而看不见有些事实已在生产上起着巨大的增产作用。举例来说，玉米双杂交种在美国早已在生产上大规模应用，起了巨大的增产作用（一般平均增产65％）。苏联自从以马茨凯维奇部长为首的农业代表团访问美国后，就吸取了他们的经验，并正在苏联大力开展这方面的研究和杂交种子生产工作，争取在1960年以前在全苏联所有玉米地都能种上双杂交种子。这些领导同志也没有将遗传学和“优生学”（即“人种改良学”）区别开来，认为“优生学”是反动的，因此遗传学也是反动的。我认为遗传学本身是一种纯理论学科，是没有阶级性的。
    他说：其实，所谓摩尔根和米丘林遗传学都很年轻，前者有五十几年，后者只有二十几年的历史。这两种遗传学还在发展，许多方面的规律性还没有完全发掘出来，目前很难说哪一种完全对、哪一种完全错，也不应当说米丘林遗传学是结合实际的。特别是结合实际这一点，可能促使某些领导同志到今天还认为摩尔根遗传学是脱离实际的，“基因”学说是没有根据的，因此是唯心的。中国科学院遗传研究室与华北农业科学研究所的合作也可能从这种观点出发的，我认为这种合作对发展遗传学并没有好处。其实，自然科学发展有它的相对独立性，不能看作自然科学的全部发展都是直接从生产发展和经济发展来决定的。要承认前代科学思想发展的意义，承认思想在社会生活中的积极作用。正如恩格斯所说的：“只要自然科学在思维着，它的发展形式是假设”。摩尔根遗传学中的“基因学说”是一种假设，米丘林遗传学中的“可塑性物质”也是一种假设，双方的目的都是想发展遗传学，但是为什么硬说“基因学说”是没有根据的唯心的甚至是反动的呢！
      “百家争鸣”的方针拯救了遗传学。自从去年中国科学院与高教部联合召开青岛遗传学座谈会后，许多遗传学家敢于讲话了，并明确了两种遗传学各有长短，各有其偏面性。摩尔根遗传学派在遗传物质基础、多倍体、人工引变、数量遗传、自交育种等方面都获得了许多有价值的结果；米丘林遗传学派在定向培育、无性杂交、选择的创造性、品种内与品种间复壮、阶段发育分析等方面也获得了不少有价值的结果。从这些结果就可以看出双方各有长短。
    戴松恩建议两方面都应该互相虚心学习，取长补短，打垮遗传学的宗派主义，继续不断地积累科学资料来丰富我国的遗传学。他说，当然，到了最后是只有一种遗传学的，因为真理只有一个。
    最后，戴松恩还就发展我国遗传学的具体措施提出了一些意见。他希望：（一）解除遗传学家不必要的行政职务和社会活动。（二）在中国科学院遗传研究室的基础上迅速筹建遗传学研究所，并成立遗传学学术委员会。在统一领导下，把国内双方遗传学家组织起来，并把他们的主要研究课题纳入统一的计划；中国科学院尽可能有计划地在人力、物力、财力方面支持他们。（三）从今年秋季学期开始，高等学校中应讲授摩尔根遗传学和米丘林遗传学，给以平等待遇。（四）今后报刊上报道遗传学研究动态时绝对不要宣传摩尔根学派这样，米丘林学派那样，避免加重不必要的对立；着重宣传某某遗传学家的研究情况，或者宣传对于某一个遗传研究问题，有哪些遗传学家获得了什么研究结果，有哪些不同的见解。只有这样，才能展开学术争论，逐步形成真正的学派，在不断争论和矛盾统一的过程中发展遗传学。（五）中国科学院明年选聘一、二位遗传学家参加生物学部，发挥遗传学方面的学术领导作用。
