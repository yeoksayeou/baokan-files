Good or Terrible?
Shanghai Liberation Daily Editorial, May 9th

Recently, our entire Party has been experiencing extraordinarily unusual days. At various symposiums convened by the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, in newspapers and periodicals, and among the broad masses of the people, everyone is discussing animatedly. Some comrades who do not understand the situation believe that there seems to be turmoil everywhere. In fact, where is there any storm? It is precisely the sunshine we need.

What is everyone discussing? Everyone is discussing the internal contradictions of the people. Everyone is criticizing and offering opinions regarding the various shortcomings and errors of our Party and the People's Government. Some express dissatisfaction with the abnormal phenomena in Party-masses relations, some have strong opinions about the bureaucratic work style of leaders at all levels, some criticize the sectarianism of Communist Party members, and some openly denounce the errors of dogmatism. People's discussions have disturbed the sweet dreams of many of our comrades, who feel oppressed by the lively debates.

Some Communist Party members feel that these discussions are very good, but some Communist Party members say they are terrible. Under this situation, some Communist Party members feel fear, resentment, difficulty, and anxiety. What are they "afraid" of? Afraid that everyone's discussions will make leadership difficult. What are they "resentful" of? They think they have worked hard for decades in the revolution, only to end up with a reputation for bureaucracy, which they find very unfair. What are they finding "difficult"? Opinions are coming from all directions, making future work difficult and life unstable. What are they "anxious" about? They believe that things are in a terrible state, and they are incapable of figuring out how to quickly put an end to the diverse opinions.

It seems that there are discussions outside the Party, and emotions within the Party. We believe that the discussions outside the Party are not terrible at all, but rather very good. What is good about them? What is good is that most of these discussions are pertinent criticisms, which are extremely beneficial for strengthening the great unity between the Party and non-Party members, the great unity of the six million people of the city, and for improving our work and overcoming our errors and shortcomings. As for the emotions within the Party, we believe that these emotions are unhealthy. Where are they unhealthy?

Let us see if the "fear" is justified. In a socialist society, under normal circumstances, leaders and the people are one, and leaders serve the people. Leaders and the people are basically in agreement. However, because the two sides are in different positions, one side is more likely to see the big picture and the long term, while the other side is more likely to see the local and immediate issues. As leaders, it is often easy to overlook the local and immediate problems of the masses. As the masses, it is often not easy to see the big picture and the long-term situation. If the two are close and well-integrated, there will be fewer contradictions; if the distance between them increases and they cannot integrate, there will be more contradictions. If we have less bureaucracy, we will be able to integrate the two aspects better; if we have a stronger bureaucratic air, the contradictions will become prominent. This is the objective law of the development of things, and "fear" cannot solve the problem in the slightest. The question is whether we are willing to bravely face the contradictions, strive to overcome bureaucracy, and improve our work style.

Some people feel "resentful." True, many of our comrades work tirelessly all day long, busy doing a lot of things for the people. However, the effects of some things may not be entirely satisfactory, so people point fingers and criticize. Among the diverse opinions, there are naturally some that are incorrect or not entirely correct. If a Communist Party member does not have the spirit to heed criticism, only sees the achievements and does not see the shortcomings, and nitpicks over whether they have been wronged, then they lack the proper demeanor of a Communist. Why do they feel resentful when they hear other people's opinions? If we trace the root and source, the reason is nothing other than the fact that in the minds of some comrades, there is still a hidden viewpoint of standing above the people. They regard the masses, the workers, peasants, students, and cadres under their leadership, and non-Party members, as their subordinates. "I am in charge of you, you are under my control, you should listen to me, but I don't have to listen to you. I have the right to criticize you, but you don't have the right to criticize me. I am the greatest, I made contributions to the revolution." These views are, of course, extremely wrong. Some comrades also often lack the ability to persuade and resort to simple administrative orders, resulting in things not being done well and alienating them from the masses. What kind of attitude is this? To put it mildly, it is an attitude of arrogance and complacency; to put it bluntly, it is that they are unconsciously influenced, to varying degrees, by the anti-people Kuomintang. Our comrades only have the obligation to be public servants of the people, and not the right to be superiors of the people. We do not have this right today, and we will never have this right. We do not have this right with small contributions, and we do not have this right with great contributions. If we do not eradicate this hidden viewpoint, we cannot eradicate the serious bureaucratic habits that come with it. From this point of view, have our comrades wronged the people, or have the people wronged us? This is something that our Communist Party members should deeply consider.

Some people have feelings of "difficulty" and "anxiety." Yes, many things now are much more complex than before. In the past, it was enough to have the ability for class struggle; now, we need the ability to handle the internal contradictions of the people, the ability to fight against nature, and the ability to manage and build the country. It is a fact that we lack these abilities. However, Communist Party members cannot bow their heads in the face of "difficulty," and should not retreat in the face of difficulties, but should humbly learn and advance in the face of difficulties. If we reverse this spirit and simplify the problem, and try to suppress it once a problem arises, this is naturally not acceptable. Some comrades, when encountering problems and contradictions, do not first reflect on themselves, and are eager to distinguish between the right and wrong of the masses, but not eager to distinguish between their own right and wrong. They criticize others eloquently and demand that they submit, but when they are criticized, they become coy and unwilling to admit their mistakes. Or they become exasperated, wishing they could beat the critic to death with a stick, or they are panic-stricken, feeling that things are in a terrible state. China is such a large country with a population of six hundred million, and Shanghai is such a large city with a population of more than six million. Can we say that we can do everything well? Can we say that all problems can be solved properly and flawlessly? Can we Communist Party members see all the problems clearly? We cannot. Since we cannot, then non-Party friends and the broad masses, who see many situations from another angle and another perspective, raise many questions, and tell us and remind us of the problems, errors, and shortcomings that we do not know, have not seen, or have not thought of, is this not very good? We should treat the criticisms of non-Party friends with the spirit of "if I hear the truth in the morning, I can die without regret in the evening." It is good or terrible that non-Party friends dare to criticize us, supervise us, and can sincerely meet us, speak to us frankly and honestly? The ancients said, "If you love someone, can you not trouble them? If you are loyal, can you not admonish them?" Non-Party friends criticize us because they love us. We say this is very good. This is a prosperous scene that has never appeared from the time of Yu, Tang, Wen, and Wu to the dynasties of the Republic of China, nor could it have appeared. Some of our comrades say every day that we must connect with the masses, unite with the masses, follow the mass line, and humbly listen to the opinions of the masses. This seems to be a mantra of revolutionaries. But when the masses raise their opinions, they are terrified. We often use the story of "Lord Ye's love of dragons" to satirize people who talk about revolution but are actually afraid of revolution. Compared to "Lord Ye's love of dragons," the attitude of some of our Party members towards the opinions of non-Party members, taking "fear," "resentment," "difficulty," and "anxiety," is only a matter of fifty steps laughing at a hundred.

It should be understood that the great cause of building socialism is not easy and cannot be accomplished by the strength of our Party alone. We must unite all possible forces and mobilize all positive factors to work together. And to do this, we must correctly handle the current contradictions within the people. This is a great change and a major juncture in the smooth progress of socialist construction. Our comrades must fully recognize the great changes in the new situation and be fully prepared to overcome this hurdle. Guan Yu in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, the way to pass the five passes was to kill six generals. Our way to pass the hurdle is not to kill generals, but to put down our airs and honestly transform ourselves.

What are our airs? Our airs are the bureaucratic airs of standing above the people; the aristocratic view that Party members are superior to non-Party members; the stinking airs and pretentious manner of old revolutionaries and veterans; and the rigid and lifeless bureaucracy of being conceited, considering ourselves special, and being divorced from the masses. Put down our airs, and honestly learn from non-Party members and from the working masses. For the great benefit of the six hundred million people, we must be determined to rectify our own bad work style, fill the gap between us and the masses, and eliminate the ideological barriers with our non-Party friends. In short, the lively discussions outside the Party are very good and should continue to unfold, as they are extremely beneficial for correcting our shortcomings and errors.

### 好得很，还是糟得很？  上海解放日报五月九日社论

    好得很，还是糟得很？
    上海解放日报五月九日社论
    近来，我们全党正在过着极其不平凡的日子。在上海市委召集的各种座谈会上，在报纸、刊物上，在广大的人民群众中，大家议论纷纷。一些不明情理的同志，认为似乎是满城风雨了。其实，哪里是什么风雨，正是我们需要的阳光。
    大家议论些什么呢？大家都在议论人民的内部矛盾；大家对于我党和人民政府的各项缺点和错误进行批评，提出意见。有的对党群关系中的不正常现象表示不满，有的对于各级领导干部的那些官僚主义作风大有意见，有的对于共产党员的宗派主义现象提出抨击，有的对于教条主义的错误予以公开的指责。人们的议论搅乱了我们许多同志的酣梦，感受到议论纷纷的压迫。
    有些共产党员觉得这些议论好得很，但是也有些共产党员却说它糟得很。有些共产党员在这种形势之下，感到又怕、又屈、又难、又急。“怕”什么呢？怕大家议论纷纷，不好领导了。“屈”什么呢？自以为辛辛苦苦，干了几十年革命，到头来还只落得一个官僚主义，大不服气。“难”什么呢？四面八方的意见压来，以后工作不好干了，没有安定的日子了。“急”什么呢？认为大事不好了，自己又无能耐，如何才能想个主意赶快把纷纷的意见收拾了才好。
    看来，党外有议论，党内有情绪。我们认为党外的议论不是糟得很，而是好得很。好在哪里呢？好在这些议论，大多数是批评得中肯的，对于加强党与非党之间的大团结，全市六百万人民的大团结，对于改进我们的工作，克服我们的错误和缺点极为有利。党内有情绪，我们认为这类情绪是不健康的。不健康在哪里呢？
    我们且看“怕”的情绪有没有道理吧。在社会主义社会里，在通常的情况下，领导者与人民是一体的，领导者是为人民服务的。领导者与人民基本上是一致的。但因两方面所处的地位不同，一方面比较容易看全局，看长远，一方面比较容易看局部，看当前。作为领导者往往容易忽视群众局部和当前的问题。作为群众往往不容易看清全局和长远的情况，如果两者接近，很好的结合起来，矛盾就少；两者距离日远，不能结合，矛盾就多。如果我们身上的官僚主义少些，就能够使这方面结合得好些，如果我们身上的官僚主义气味重些，矛盾就要突出。这是事物发展的客观规律，“怕”是丝毫也不能解决问题的。问题在于我们是否愿意勇敢地正视矛盾，努力克服官僚主义，改进我们的工作作风。
    有人觉得“委屈”。不错，我们的许多同志终日辛劳不已，忙忙碌碌，为人民做了不少事情。可是有些事情的效果并不能全如人意，所以人家东也指，西也责。在纷纷的议论之中，自然也有某些意见是不正确的，或不完全正确的，如果一个共产党员，没有闻者足戒的精神，只看见有成绩的一面，不看见有缺点的一面，斤斤计较是否受了委屈，这就缺乏共产党人应有的风度。究竟为什么听了人家的意见，就觉得委屈呢？如若追一下根，溯一下源，原因无它，这是因为在某些同志的头脑里，还隐藏着一种站在人民之上的观点。他们把群众，把他领导下的工人、农民、学生、干部，把党外人士，看做是属于自己管的手下人。我是管你们的，你们是归我管的，你们应该听我的，而我可以不听你们的。我有权批评你，你没有权批评我。我是天下第一，老子革命有功。这些观点，当然是极端错误的。有些同志还往往缺乏说服的本领，乞求于简单的行政命令，结果事情办不好，而且脱离了群众。这种态度是什么态度呢？说得好听些是骄傲自满的态度，说得不好听些，就是不自觉的多多少少受到了一些反人民的国民党的影响。我们的同志只有当人民公仆的义务，没有当人民上司的权利，今天没有这个权利，一辈子也没有这个权利。功劳小没有这个权利，功劳天大也没有这个权利。不革除这种隐藏着的观点，就不能革除随着这种观点而来的严重的官僚习气。由此看来到底是我们某些同志委屈了人家，还是人家委屈了我们？这是值得我们共产党员深思的。
    有人有“难”、有“急”的情绪。是的，现在的许多事情是比从前的复杂得多了。从前只要有阶级斗争的本领就行了，现在要有处理人民内部矛盾的本领，要有向自然界作斗争的本领，要有管理国家，建设国家的本领。我们缺乏这些本领是事实。但是共产党人不能在“难”字的面前低头，不应该知难而退，而应该虚心学习，知难而进。如果一反这种精神，把问题简单化，一旦发生问题就想压服一下，这自然是不行的。有些同志遇到问题，碰到了矛盾，不先反求诸己，急于去分清群众的是非，却不急于分清自己的是非。批评人家振振有词，要求人家服贴，被人批评就忸忸怩怩，不肯认错。或者气急败坏，不是恨不得想把批评者一棍子打死，就是惊慌失措，觉得大事不好了。中国是这样一个六亿人口的大国，上海是这样一个六百多万人口的大城市，我们能够说我们所有的事都能办得很好吗？所有的问题都能解决得妥善无缺吗？我们共产党人能把所有的问题看得一清二楚吗？不能。既然不能，那么党外的朋友，广大的群众，他们从另一个角度，另一个侧面看到许多情况，提出许多问题，他们把我们所不知道的，没有看到、没有想到的问题、错误和缺点告诉我们，提醒我们，这岂不很好吗？我们对待党外朋友的批评，应该有“朝闻道，夕死可矣”的精神。党外的朋友勇于批评我们，监督我们，能够和我们真诚相见，推心置腹地说话，这是糟得很呢，还是好得很呢？古人说，“爱之能勿劳乎，忠焉能勿诲乎”，党外朋友爱我们才批评我们。我们说这好得很，这是中国从禹汤文武起，一直到民国历代所没有出现过的，也不可能出现的一种繁荣昌盛的景象。我们有些同志嘴里天天说要联系群众，团结群众，要走群众路线，要虚心听取群众意见，这似乎是革命者的口头禅了。群众提意见了，又害怕得要死。我们常常以“叶公好龙”的故事讽刺一些口头上讲革命，实际上怕革命的人；我们的某些党员同志，对待党外人士的意见，采取“怕”、“屈”、“难”、“急”的态度，这和“叶公好龙”相比也不过是五十步笑百步罢了。
    须知，建设社会主义这个伟大的事业是不容易的，不是我们一党之力所能成功的。我们必须团结一切可能团结的力量，调动一切可以调动的积极因素来协力以赴。而要做到这一点，则必须正确地处理当前人民内部的矛盾。这是顺利地进行社会主义建设的一个大变化，一个大关。我们的同志要充分认识新情况的大变化，要有充分的准备来过这一关。三国志上的关羽，过五关的办法是斩了六名大将，我们过关的办法不是斩将，而是放下架子，老老实实改造自己。
    什么是我们的架子？我们的架子就是站在人民之上的官派；就是党员优于非党员高人一等的贵族观点；就是老革命，老资格的臭气势、臭派头；就是自命不凡，特殊自居，脱离群众的生硬僵死的官僚主义。把架子放下，老老实实地向党外人士学习，向劳动群众学习，为了六亿人民的大利益，我们要下决心整掉我们自己的不良作风，填平我们与群众之间的鸿沟，消除与党外朋友的思想上的壁障。总之，党外的纷纷议论好得很，应当继续展开，这对于改正我们的缺点和错误是极为有益的。
