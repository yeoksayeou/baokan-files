Learn to Correctly Treat the Ideological Problems of Youth
Notes on the Discussion of Ideological Work at the Third National Congress of the Communist Youth League
By Our Correspondent Zhang Shihong

In the speeches of the delegates at the Third National Congress of the Communist Youth League, relatively concentrated attention was paid to the issue of ideological work. Ideological work is emphasized because it is the main key to doing a good job in the League's work. Since the second half of last year, due to the fundamental changes in class relations in our country, this change has had a profound impact on the ideology of Chinese youth, and various ideological contradictions among youth have become more prominent. Under such a new situation, the ideological work of the Communist Youth League has become more arduous and complex, and therefore summarizing the successful and failed experiences in this area is of urgent significance. How to correctly handle the current ideological contradictions of youth, how to truly make the three slogans of the Congress, "Labor, Study, Unity," the common language of the nation's youth. This is a serious topic placed before the delegates. Exploring this topic and studying this topic has become the strong desire of all delegates. All the delegates listened with excitement to the many successful experiences in the work of the Communist Youth League: the Communist Youth League of the Ministry of Railways played a brilliant advanced role in the construction of the Yingxia Railway; the Communist Youth League organization of the Qaidam Geological Exploration Team overcame numerous difficulties and devised various methods to resolve the ideological contradictions of the Youth League members and the youth masses; the Communist Youth League of Fujian Province victoriously launched the "Thousand Jin Rice, Ten Thousand Jin Sweet Potato" movement; the youth of Xitang Cooperative in Wangcheng County, Hunan, under the leadership of the Youth League branch, became an active force in the development of pig raising; the Youth League branch of Zhao Shipan Township in Hengshan County, Shaanxi, assisted the Party in completing the task of greening the entire township. These successes are inseparable from the series of lively and vigorous ideological work carried out by the Communist Youth League among the broad masses of young people. Learning from these experiences, the first thing is to learn how they resolved the ideological contradictions of youth, thereby mobilizing the enthusiasm of youth. These speeches gave the delegates a lot of inspiration.

However, it can be seen from many speeches that there are still relatively common shortcomings of simplicity and crudeness in the ideological work of the Communist Youth League. Comrade Hu Yaobang pointed out in his report to the Congress: "It is a fantasy to demand the ideological revolutionization of youth by simple, stiff, impatient, and crude methods." However, in the past few years, League organizations holding this "fantasy" were not isolated cases. Deng Xiang, Secretary of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, pointed out in his speech that some factory League organizations regarded the "backward elements" in their eyes as burdens, believing that these people were "a rat dropping spoiling the whole pot of soup," and did not respect their opinions, did not trust them, and even restricted League members from approaching them, and instead of adopting educational methods to their shortcomings, they adopted simple and crude attitudes. This was not only the case for youth outside the League, but also for Youth League members. Huang Jifa, who was originally an active member of the League, was forced to withdraw from the League, which is a typical example. Huang Jifa had some dissatisfaction because the rating was not reasonable enough, and he complained. This matter could have been resolved reasonably, but the League branch did not carefully investigate it, and indiscriminately criticized his mistakes at the League branch meeting. Once, Huang was sharpening a knife and quarreled with a veteran worker. This veteran worker exaggerated to the League branch that Huang was sharpening a knife to kill someone. The League branch completely believed it without investigation and opened another branch meeting to question him: "Why are you sharpening a knife to kill someone?" Huang Jifa felt wronged, could not bear it any longer, and proposed to withdraw from the League. When the League branch talked to him, they continued to question his motive for joining the League; saying that if the salary was unreasonable, he should "subordinate the individual to the collective," otherwise he would be "ideologically backward," but Huang still withdrew from the League. Zhai Taifeng, Secretary of the League Committee of a state-owned factory in Beijing, said that a few years ago, they recruited a group of young workers from other places. When they first arrived, they had opinions about their future, living conditions, and wages. They did not analyze the reasons for these problems, nor did they examine their own shortcomings in their work, but only thought that the workers were backward, and subjectively opened a political training class and asked the factory director to talk to them about the history of social development, "how monkeys become humans." As a result, everyone was unwilling to listen, saying that they had already heard it. The factory director not only did not listen to everyone's opinions and change his educational methods, but instead became furious and said: "Shut up, I order you to listen." Ma Zuling, Secretary of the Communist Youth League of Gansu Province, said in his speech that in the past, the Communist Youth League adopted the method of suppression for various ideological problems of young people from other places who came to Gansu, and casually put on several hats such as "serious bourgeois ideology." As a result, the more the youth were suppressed, the more opinions they had, and the bureaucratic and rude style became more and more crude, the relationship between the youth from other places and the local youth became more tense, and the contradiction between the leaders and the masses became more acute. Many facts have proved that this simple and crude approach in ideological work not only does not help to resolve the ideological contradictions of youth, but deepens these contradictions. Youth disturbances in some places also occurred under these circumstances. The delegates analyzed the reasons for these shortcomings in ideological work, pointing out that the League's leading ideology lagged behind reality, the sectarian and arrogant emotions of the League cadres, and the absolutist and one-sided nature of the League cadres' thinking methods all allowed subjectivism, dogmatism, and simple and crude styles to develop. Comrade Xiang Nan specifically analyzed this issue in his report entitled "Ideological Work Must Adapt to the New Situation," criticized subjectivism and dogmatism, and called on the delegates and League cadres to "learn to reason and learn to persuade young people." This report was warmly welcomed. The report made by Comrade Lu Dingyi at the Congress greatly enlightened the thinking of all the delegates, enabling them to fully recognize the long-term and arduous nature of ideological work; and to recognize that ideological work must rely on discussion, debate, and reasoning to achieve its goals, and that simplicity and crudeness are not allowed in the slightest.

So, how to correctly conduct ideological education for young people?

This is an issue that requires in-depth study. While exposing and criticizing the simple and impatient tendencies in ideological work, many speeches discussed this issue from a positive perspective, and some speeches put forward many valuable opinions from both theoretical and practical aspects. The speech of the First Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League was generally recognized as being relatively brilliant. This speech told people that various ideological problems of youth must be specifically analyzed to prevent subjectivity and one-sidedness, and to overcome simple and crude handling methods. Many League cadres in Beijing had confused ideas about some of the ideological problems that young people had generated under the new situation, believing that the mainstream of youth ideology was unhealthy. They also wanted to adopt suppressive methods to solve the problems. The Municipal Committee of the League convened an ideological work conference to analyze the ideological contradictions of youth. At the meeting, some comrades believed that the great changes had brought economism, hedonism, and individualism to young people. After specific analysis, it was realized that this statement was incorrect. For example, after agricultural cooperativization, rural youth are particularly concerned about their work points, thus the phenomenon of scrambling for work and picking jobs happens, which is not necessarily individualism. Because after the advanced cooperatives, their income completely depends on labor, how much work they do and how many points they get, so the young people will naturally be more concerned about their labor work points than in the past. When the cooperatives are first established, the management lacks experience, and the regulations on work points are not completely reasonable, so it is inevitable to scramble for work and pick jobs. This is a new problem under the new situation, and some problems need to be solved by improving the work, and we cannot simply criticize the youth. For another example, young workers demand to improve the conditions for life, study, and work. Although there are unreasonable demands among them, there are also reasonable demands, which must be specifically analyzed. Reasonable demands should be supported and helped to be solved, and unreasonable demands should be explained and educated. We cannot generally think that the youth have committed the errors of economism and hedonism. In short, specifically analyzing various ideological problems of youth, grasping the nature, severity, and causes of these problems, is the first step and the decisive step in carrying out ideological work practically and effectively.

After making a concrete analysis of various ideological contradictions, our ideological work will be more persuasive, and we will be able to adhere to the policy of persuasive education and carry out patient work for the youth. Many delegates compared the two different methods of conducting ideological work and the different results in their speeches. The result of using suppression is failure; the result of using persuasion is success. Sun Lianqing, Deputy Secretary of the Communist Youth League of Hubei Province, gave an example in his speech: During one period, young new workers in the machining workshop and the forging workshop of the Wuhan Auto Parts Factory had opinions on work, study, and life. The League organization of the machining workshop ignored the opinions of the youth and adopted the methods of indiscriminate criticism, insults, and suppression, resulting in the incident of more than 20 new workers being absent from work at the same time. The League branch of the forging workshop did not do this. They studied the workers' opinions with the Party branch, believing that the youth's demand to improve their skills was reasonable and should be solved; the demand to be transferred back to the Northeast and dislike of the hot weather in Wuhan was unreasonable and should be persuaded and educated. They convened a symposium to clarify the reasons for keeping them in the factory, and at the same time proposed measures on how to improve their technical level; after the meeting, they also talked individually to those who were ideologically unconvinced. In this way, the problem was solved, and the new workers' production enthusiasm was full, and they overfulfilled the plan every month.

The new stage of development of our country has put forward new tasks for the broad masses of young people, that is, to work better, study better, and unite better. If the Communist Youth League is to achieve these new tasks, it must better carry out ideological education work among the Youth League members and the youth masses, truly improve the quality of the League's ideological work, thereby improving all aspects of the League's work. In this way, the Communist Youth League can achieve its new tasks put forward under the new situation and better lead the nation's youth to build socialism.

    学会正确地对待青年的思想问题
    记青年团第三次全国代表大会关于思想工作的讨论
    本报记者　章世鸿
    在青年团第三次全国代表大会上代表们的发言中，比较集中地注意到了思想工作的问题。思想工作所以引起重视，因为它是作好团的工作的主要关键。自从去年下半年以来，由于我国阶级关系发生了根本的变化，这种变化在我国青年思想中发生了深刻的影响，青年中各种各样的思想矛盾更加变得突出起来。在这样一个新形势下面，青年团的思想工作就显得更为艰巨，更为复杂，因而总结这方面的成功的经验和失败的经验就具有迫切的意义。怎样正确地去处理当前青年的思想矛盾，怎样把大会的三个口号“劳动、学习、团结”真正成为全国青年共同的语言。这是摆在代表们面前一个严重的课题。探讨这个课题，研究这个课题，已经成为所有代表强烈的愿望。全体代表兴奋地听取了青年团工作中许多成功的经验：铁道部青年团在修建鹰厦铁路中发挥了光辉的先进作用；柴达木地质勘探队的青年团组织克服了重重困难，想出种种办法，解决了青年团员和青年群众的思想矛盾；福建省青年团胜利地开展了“千斤稻，万斤薯”运动；湖南望城县西塘社青年在团支部带动下成为发展生猪事业中一支活跃的力量；陕西横山县赵石畔乡团支部协助党完成了绿化全乡的任务。这些成功都是和青年团在广大青年中进行了一系列生动活泼的思想工作分不开的。学习这些经验，首先就是学习他们怎样解决青年思想矛盾，从而调动了青年的积极性。这些发言给代表们很多启发。
    但从许多发言中可以看出，青年团的思想工作中还存在着比较普遍的简单粗暴的缺点。胡耀邦同志的大会报告中指出：“用简单的、生硬的、急躁的、粗暴的方法去要求青年的思想革命化，是一种幻想。”但过去几年中，抱着这种“幻想”的团组织不是个别的。青年团武汉市委书记邓祥在发言中指出，有些工厂团组织把他们眼中的“落后分子”当作包袱，认为这些人是“一颗老鼠屎搅乱了一锅粥”，不尊重他们的意见，不信任他们，甚至限制团员去和他们接近，对他们的缺点不是采取教育的办法而是采取简单粗暴的态度。不但对团外青年是如此，对青年团员也是如此，原来是团内积极分子的黄继发被迫退团，就是一个典型例子。黄继发因为评级评的不够合理有些不满情绪，发了一些牢骚，这件事原是可以合理解决的，但团支部并没有仔细进行调查，就在团支部大会上不加分析地指责他的错误。有一次黄在磨刀，和老师傅吵了嘴，这位老师傅就向团支部夸大说黄在磨刀，要杀人。团支部完全不加调查竟信以为真，又开支部大会质问他：“为什么磨刀杀人？”黄继发受了委屈，忍无可忍，提出了退团。团支部和他谈话时，继续追问他入团的动机；说工资不合理应“个人服从集体”，否则便是“觉悟不高”，但黄还是退团了。北京一个国营厂团委书记翟泰丰说，他们前几年从外地召集一批青工，刚来时，对前途问题、生活问题、工资问题有意见，他们并没有分析这些问题产生的原因，也没有检查自己工作上的缺点，而只认为工人落后，主观地开了一个政治训练班，请厂长给他们讲社会发展史，“猴子怎样变人”，结果大家都不愿听，说早已听过了。厂长不但不听取大家的意见，改变自己的教育办法，反而大发脾气说：“住嘴，我命令你们要听下去。”青年团甘肃省委书记马祖灵发言中说，过去青年团对外地来甘肃的青年的各种思想问题采取压的办法，随便给戴上几顶“资产阶级思想严重”等帽子。结果是越压青年意见越多，而官僚主义者粗暴作风就变得愈粗暴，外来青年和本地青年关系更加紧张，领导和群众的矛盾更加尖锐。许多事实证明，思想工作中的这种简单粗暴的作法不但无助于解决青年的思想矛盾，反而加深了这种矛盾，有些地方青年闹事也是在这种情况下发生的。代表们分析了思想工作中产生这些缺点的原因，指出团的领导思想落后于实际，团干部的宗派主义情绪和骄傲情绪，团干部思想方法上的绝对化和片面性，都使主观主义、教条主义、简单粗暴的作风得以发展。项南同志在以“思想工作要适应新的形势”为题的报告中具体地分析了这个问题，批判了主观主义和教条主义，并且号召代表们和团干部要“学会讲道理，学会说服青年”，这个报告受到了热烈欢迎。陆定一同志在大会上所作的报告对所有代表的思想都有极大的启发，使他们充分认识到思想工作的长期性和艰巨性；认识到思想工作必须依靠讨论、辩论、说理的办法去达到，是丝毫也简单粗暴不得的。
    那么，怎样正确地对青年进行思想教育呢？
    这是需要深入研究的一个问题。不少发言在揭发和批判思想工作中的简单急躁倾向的同时，正面地论述了这个问题，有些发言从理论和实践方面提出了很多宝贵的意见。青年团北京市委第一书记的发言被公认为是比较精采的，这个发言告诉人们对青年的各种思想问题必须加以具体分析，防止主观性和片面性，克服简单粗暴的处理办法。北京市许多团干部对青年们在新形势下所产生的一些思想问题曾经产生一些混乱思想，认为青年思想的主流是不健康的。他们还想采取压制的办法来解决问题。团市委召开了思想工作会议，对青年思想矛盾进行了分析。在会议上，有的同志认为大变动给青年带来了经济主义、享乐主义和个人主义。经过具体分析，才认识到这种说法是不对的。例如农村青年在农业合作化以后，特别关心自己的工分，因而发生争分挑活的现象，这并不一定是个人主义。因为高级合作化以后，他们的收入完全依靠劳动力，干多少活记多少分，青年们自然会比过去关心自己的劳动工分。合作社刚办起来，经营管理还缺乏经验，工分规定并不完全合理，这样争分挑活是难免的，这是新形势下的新问题，有些问题要在改进工作中来解决，而不能一味批评青年。再如青年工人要求改善生活、学习和工作的条件，其中固然有不合理的要求，但也有合理的要求，必须具体分析，对合理的要求予以支持，帮助其解决，对不合理的则予以解释和教育，不能一概认为是青年犯了经济主义、享乐主义的错误。总之具体地分析青年各种思想问题，掌握这些问题的性质、严重程度和产生原因，是切实有效地进行思想工作的第一步，也是决定性的一步。
    对各种思想矛盾作了具体分析后，我们的思想工作才有说服力，才能坚持说服教育的方针，对青年进行耐心的工作。不少代表发言中对照了进行思想工作的两种不同的方法和不同的结果。用压服的办法，其结果是失败；用说服的办法，其结果是成功。青年团湖北省委副书记孙连清发言中举出这样一个例子：有一个时期武汉汽车配件厂加工车间和锻工车间的青年新工人，对工作、学习和生活都有意见，加工车间的团组织漠视青年的意见，采取不加分析的批判、辱骂和压制的办法，结果发生了二十多个新工人同时旷工的事件。锻工车间团支部却不是这样做，他们和党支部研究了工人的意见，认为青年要求提高技术是合理的，应当解决；要求调回东北，嫌武汉天热是不合理的，应当说服教育。他们召开了座谈会，把要他们留在厂内的道理说清楚，同时提出如何提高他们技术水平的措施；会后又找个别思想不通的个别谈心。这样，问题就得到了解决，新工人生产情绪饱满，月月超额完成计划。
    我们国家发展的新阶段，给广大青年提出了新任务，这就是要更好地劳动，更好地学习，更好地团结。青年团要实现这些新的任务，就要更好地在青年团员中和青年群众中进行思想教育工作，真正把团的思想工作的质量提高一步，从而把团的各方面工作提高一步。这样，青年团才能实现自己在新形势下提出的新任务，更好地带动全国青年来建设社会主义。
