　　The day after the U.S. Sixth Fleet's Marines landed menacingly in Lebanon, the British Conservative Party's "Daily Telegraph" commented: "Those who believe the thermo-nuclear age has ruled out gunboat diplomacy need to think again this morning... President Eisenhower has not only imitated a little bit of Lord Palmerston, he has learned him entirely."
　　Gunboat diplomacy is a British heirloom. The Palmerston mentioned by the "Daily Telegraph" (who served as British Secretary of War, Foreign Secretary and Prime Minister from 1809 until 1865) was known for implementing "rash" and "domineering" gunboat diplomacy. This diplomacy was specifically manifested in interfering in the revolutions of Portugal and Spain, armed aggression against the Balkan and Near Eastern countries, launching the Opium War, and bloodily suppressing the Indian people... Today, British gunboat diplomacy is no longer effective, and warships flying the Stars and Stripes have replaced it in the Middle East to promote the "Eisenhower Doctrine." Nostalgic for the past, the "Daily Telegraph" could not help but write with emotion: Today's American approach is difficult to find a comparable "deliberate use of the navy to achieve diplomatic purposes" in British history.
　　However, the British conservatives are not regretting that Britain's more successful disciple has inherited its mantle of gunboat diplomacy. They openly praise the United States for doing so in the Middle East as "correct." The problem is that the apprentice has undermined the teacher, so some British people are very upset. The Conservative Party's "Daily Briefing" questioned: "Does Washington now agree that Eden (attacking Egypt) was right? ... You cannot do things in an election year, but you do them at the beginning of another year. ... What kind of way is this to pursue foreign policy!" However, some more experienced Conservatives than the "Daily Briefing" are unwilling to raise such alarmist questions, and advocate honestly learning from their apprentice again. Sir Churchill broke his silence on May 3 and said: "In the sharp international competition we face, victory will belong to the country with the most nimble hands and brains. We must catch up where we lag behind; we must continue to run ahead where we lead." It seems that the contest between master and apprentice will become increasingly acute. (Ping)

    师徒之间
    美国第六舰队的海军陆战队杀气腾腾地在黎巴嫩登陆的第二天，英国保守党的“每日电讯报”发表评论说：“认为热核时代已经排除了炮舰外交的人，今天上午需要再想一想。……艾森豪威尔总统不单是向帕默斯通侯爵模仿了一点，他把他整个儿地学了过来。”
    炮舰外交本是英国的传家宝。“每日电讯报”提到的帕默斯通（他从1809年起历任英国的陆军大臣、外交大臣和首相，直到1865年），就以执行“冒失的”和“专横的”炮舰外交而闻名。这种外交具体表现在干涉葡萄牙和西班牙的革命、武装侵略巴尔干和中近东国家、发动鸦片战争、血腥地镇压印度人民……。今天，英国的炮舰外交不灵了，而插着星条旗的军舰却代替它在中东来推销“艾森豪威尔主义”了。缅怀往事，“每日电讯报”不禁感慨系之地写道：美国今天的做法，在英国历史上也很难找到能够与之相比的“有意用海军来达到外交目的的例子”。
    但是，英国保守党人倒不是因为英国的这位青出于蓝的弟子继承了它的炮舰外交衣钵而有所惋惜。他们公开称赞美国在中东这样做是“正确的”。问题是徒弟挖过老师的墙角，所以有些英国人非常不平。保守党的“每日简报”质问说：“现在华盛顿同意不同意，艾登（进攻埃及）是对的？……在选举年中你们不能做的事情，你们在另外一年一开始就做。……这是怎么样一种奉行外交政策的方法呀！”可是，一些比“每日简报”老练的保守党人，却不愿意提出这种大惊小怪的问题，而主张要老老实实地向自己的徒弟去再学习。丘吉尔爵士在5月3日就打破沉默发言说：“在我们面临的尖锐的国际竞赛中，胜利将属于拥有最灵巧的手脑的国家。我们必须在我们落后的地方迎头赶上；我们必须在我们领先的地方继续跑在前面。”看来，师父和徒弟之间，斗法还会越来越尖锐。　（平）
