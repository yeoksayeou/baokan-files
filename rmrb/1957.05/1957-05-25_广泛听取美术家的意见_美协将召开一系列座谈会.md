    Widely Solicit Opinions from Artists
    Chinese Artists Association to Hold a Series of Symposia
    (Our Newspaper) The Chinese Artists Association, in order to widely solicit opinions from artists regarding the association and relevant leading departments, has consulted with various relevant departments and decided to convene a series of symposia. These symposia will be held separately based on different art forms and content, including traditional Chinese painting, sculpture, comic strips, New Year pictures, propaganda posters, illustrations, oil painting, book design, stage art, slides, cartoons, folk artists, art criticism, art editors, publishing, distribution, arts and crafts, and prints. Participants will primarily be members of the Artists Association, but some non-member artists will also be invited.
    The symposia began on the 18th of this month. Symposia on traditional Chinese painting, sculpture, and comic strips, New Year pictures, propaganda posters, and illustrations have already been held. Attendees spoke frankly and enthusiastically. As their opinions were not fully expressed, meetings will be held regularly in the future.
