State Council Issues Notice
Extending Apprenticeship Period

This newspaper reports that the State Council recently issued a notice to the People's Committees of all provinces, autonomous regions, and directly administered municipalities, as well as to all ministries and commissions under the State Council, regarding the extension of the apprenticeship period.

The notice states that in 1956, all departments and regions recruited a large number of apprentices (trainees). According to statistics from twenty ministries including industry, transportation, construction, land reclamation, and fisheries, approximately 510,000 apprentices were recruited. A portion of these have already been converted to formal workers. As of the end of last year, approximately 370,000 were still in apprenticeship, with approximately 190,000 being trained in enterprises and institutions, approximately 110,000 being trained in technical schools, and approximately 70,000 being trained in training classes. According to the original plan, most of these apprentices were to be converted to formal workers this year. However, due to adjustments in the scale and speed of construction this year, the start-up time for some newly built enterprises has been delayed. Consequently, the actual number of new workers that various departments need to supplement this year is far less than originally planned. Some departments even have a surplus of existing workers and do not need to supplement at all.

The notice states that, based on the above situation, this year, if production does not require the supplement of formal workers when apprentices (including trainees in commercial enterprises) complete their study period, the study period should be extended, and they should be persuaded to continue their studies in their original units. The extension period should be determined by the competent authorities or the People's Committees of the provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities, based on the specific circumstances. If production truly requires the supplement of formal workers and apprentices need to be transferred to formal positions, the actual number needed should be reported to the competent department or the People's Committees of the provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions for approval. Only after passing an examination can they be converted to formal workers. Apprentices whose studies are extended will be formally transferred after the extended period expires and will not be extended again.

When apprentices are converted to formal workers, those who implement a grade wage system should generally not be graded higher than Grade 2 workers. Those who implement a position wage system should be subject to regulations made by the competent authorities in light of the actual situation, with reference to the control spirit of the aforementioned grading.

Students in worker technical schools and trainees in technical training classes who are scheduled to graduate this year should undergo strict examinations based on the needs of production, and a portion of them should graduate. Those with poorer performance should stay in school to continue their studies. If some departments do not need to supplement workers in production, the study period for these graduating students can be extended, and they will not graduate this year.

The notice states that, for apprentices, students, and trainees who continue their studies after extending the study period, all units should take various measures to fully explain and persuade them, resolve their ideological concerns, and improve and enrich the content of their studies so that they can consciously and peacefully continue their studies. Sufficient explanation work should also be done for the masters regarding the extension of the apprentices' study period.

The notice concludes by saying that, when transferring apprentices to formal positions in accordance with the aforementioned regulations, demobilized construction soldiers among the apprentices may be given priority in the transfer, under the same technical conditions.

### 国务院发出通知  延长学徒学习期限

    国务院发出通知
    延长学徒学习期限
    本报讯　国务院最近给各省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会和国务院各部、各委员会等发出了一项延长学徒的学习期限的通知。
    通知中说，1956年各部门、各地区都招收了大量的学徒（练习生），据工业、交通、建筑、农垦、水产等二十个部的统计，约共招收了五十一万人，其中一部分已经转为正式工人。到去年年底，还在学徒期间的约有三十七万人，其中在企业、事业单位中培训的约十九万人，在技工学校培训的约十一万人，在训练班培训的约七万人。按原计划，这些学徒大都应在今年转为正式工人。但是由于今年的建设规模和速度有了调整，有些新建企业的开工时间推迟，因而各部门今年实际需要补充的新工人，比原计划数大大减少，有的部门原有的工人还有多余，根本不需要补充。
    通知中说，基于上述情况，今年，各企业、事业单位的学徒（包括商业企业的练习生），在学习期满时，如果生产上不需要补充正式工人，应当延长学习期限，说服他们在原单位继续学习。延长学习的期间由主管部门或省、自治区、市人民委员会根据具体情况自行决定。如因生产上确需补充正式工人需要学徒转正时，应当提出实际需要的人数报经主管部或省、市、自治区人民委员会批准后，经过考试合格，方可转为正式工人。延长学习的学徒，在延长期限满期后，即行转正，不再延长。
    学徒转为正式工人时，实行等级工资制的，定级一般不得超过二级工；实行岗位工资制的，由主管部门根据具体情况参照上述定级的控制精神自行规定。
    原定在今年毕业的工人技术学校学生和技工训练班学员，应该根据生产的需要，进行严格的考试，毕业一部分；成绩较差的应当留校继续学习。有的部门，如果生产上不需要补充工人，对于这些应届毕业的学生可以延长学习期间，今年不毕业。
    通知说，对于延长学习期限继续学习的学徒、学生、学员，各单位应当采取各种方式向他们进行充分的解释说服工作，打通思想，并且改进和充实学习的内容，使他们能够自觉地、安心地继续学习。对于延长学徒的学习期限，还要向师傅进行充分的解释工作。
    通知最后说，在按照前述规定进行转正的时候，学徒中的复员建设军人在同等技术条件的情况下，可以优先转正。
