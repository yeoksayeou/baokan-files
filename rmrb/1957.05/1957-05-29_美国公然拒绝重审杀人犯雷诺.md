Xinhua News Agency, May 28th: According to International News Service, the United States has refused to retry U.S. Army Sergeant Reynolds. U.S. Ambassador to Taiwan, Rankin, yesterday delivered a note from Washington to the Kuomintang's "Ministry of Foreign Affairs," stating that retrial of Reynolds for the Liu Ziran shooting case was "impossible." This note was delivered by the U.S. in response to a request from Yeh Kung-chao, who had inquired of Rankin about the possibility of retrying Reynolds.

United Press International today issued an internal bulletin from Tokyo, revealing the true intentions of the U.S. military court's "trial" of Reynolds in Taipei at the time. The bulletin stated: The U.S. "Department of the Army pushed for the trial" in order to "exonerate Reynolds and extricate him from the case."

    美国公然拒绝重审杀人犯雷诺
    新华社28日讯　据国际新闻社消息，美国拒绝重审美军上士雷诺。美国驻台湾“大使”兰金昨天把华盛顿的照会递交给国民党“外交部”，照会说，为枪杀刘自然案而重审雷诺是“不可能的”。这个照会是美国为了答复叶公超的要求而递交的。叶公超曾向兰金探询是否可能重审雷诺。
    合众社今天从东京发出了一则内部通报，其中透露了美国军事法庭当时在台北“审讯”雷诺的真正用心。通报中说：美国“陆军部力促举行审讯”，是为了“替雷诺洗清罪责，并且使他从案件中摆脱出来”。
