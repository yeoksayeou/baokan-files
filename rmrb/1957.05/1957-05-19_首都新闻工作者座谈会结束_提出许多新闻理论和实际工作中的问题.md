Reported by this newspaper: The Capital Journalists' Symposium concluded yesterday. The three-day meeting became increasingly lively each day, with more attendees.

At the final day's symposium, Deng Jixing advocated for more "fraternal" (同仁) newspapers. She stated that "fraternal" newspapers should become the democratic parties of newspapers, competing with Party newspapers and reducing subjective bias in reporting.

Deng Jixing expressed strong dissatisfaction with the unequal treatment of Party and non-Party newspapers. She said, "Some say that Party newspapers are the 'biological sons,' while non-Party newspapers are 'adopted sons,' and this is well-founded. Not only do reporters receive different treatment during interviews, but there are also differences in paper allocation. It's said that the paper allocated to the People's Daily exceeds its actual needs. Non-Party newspapers don't have enough paper, and the quality is poor. The same goes for machinery; Party newspapers have high-speed rotary presses, while non-Party newspapers continue to use old machines." She added, "The most ridiculous thing is that all newspapers pay the same 25% distribution fee to the post office, but the post office only bundles newspapers for the People's Daily, not for Ta Kung Pao."

Veteran journalist Mao Jianwu believed that Ta Kung Pao reporters face setbacks everywhere and are subjected to sectarian attacks. The Journalists Association has never expressed its position on such matters.

Mao Jianwu suggested: "Some experienced veteran journalists who were skilled in editing have changed careers since liberation. Should we consider calling them back?"

Mao Jianwu advocated that leading cadres in the news sector should "take off their shoes and go to the fields," write their own news reports and articles, and not spend all day in meetings, busy with leadership.

Chen Shijing, a teaching assistant in journalism at Peking University, sharply criticized the teaching work of the journalism department. He believed there is a "crisis in journalism education." "News theory is poor, and dogmatism is serious." "The crisis in journalism education is actually a crisis in news theory." "In teaching, there is 'five natures unified,' unifying Party spirit, mass character, ideological nature, combativeness, and guidance under Party spirit, thus unifying away anything lively and vibrant." As a result, students feel that "it's better to listen to idealism than to listen to dogmatism."

Guangming Daily reporter Ba Bo spoke about his views on newspapers. He said, "The newspaper is a textbook," which was correct in the past. It's not necessarily correct to say that now. Even so, whatever the newspaper says now is still what people do below.

People's Daily Editor-in-Chief Deng Tuo believed that this symposium marked the beginning of "contention" in the news industry. He said that based on the discussions over the past few days, everyone's discussions focused on two types of issues. One type is news theory issues, such as the class nature, commodity nature, guiding nature, and interestingness of news, as well as freedom of the press, news value, etc. There are different views on each, and they should be studied in depth and continue to be debated. The other type is practical work issues, which should be analyzed, addressed appropriately, and effective measures should be taken to gradually resolve them.

Deng Tuo said that after the basic end of class struggle in our society, social relations have undergone fundamental changes, and how to correctly handle contradictions among the people is a new subject. We have no experience and cannot keep up with the development of the objective situation. This is the root cause of many problems.

Deng Tuo said that the staff of the People's Daily editorial department are not satisfied with the newspapers they edit. We feel that other newspapers have advantages worth learning from. We must humbly learn from other newspapers and improve our work. Deng Tuo believed that the phenomena of bureaucratization and officialdom in newspaper offices should be changed; many professional cadres should personally participate in writing and editing. Deng Tuo also said that the All-China Journalists Association will organize a publication called "Journalism Studies" as a forum for debate in the news industry.

Xinhua News Agency President Wu Lengxi hoped that everyone would provide more suggestions to Xinhua News Agency to help the comrades of Xinhua News Agency rectify their work. He said that there is a very prominent contradiction in the news industry now, which is the contradiction between news agencies and newspapers and radio stations. "Each newspaper should have its own characteristics and style. However, news agencies, newspapers, and radio stations should also divide their labor and cooperate to avoid offsetting and wasting efforts."

Wu Lengxi said that news agencies were originally created to meet the needs of newspapers and radio stations. Xinhua News Agency and newspapers and radio stations have a cooperative relationship, not a commercial relationship. In the past, unified release of certain news was to meet the needs of the time, but because the unification was too tight, too strict, and too rigid, and not enough consideration was given to the different needs of newspapers, some problems arose. Now, Xinhua News Agency is willing to better serve newspapers and radio stations. In addition to continuing to broadcast news of common interest to various newspapers and radio stations, it also plans to provide some special articles to meet their special needs.

Others who spoke at the meeting yesterday included: Hu Ci from the PLA Daily, Wang Shunhua from the People's Highway News, Lei Peng from the Beijing Branch of Xinhua News Agency, Pei Yusun from the Young Pioneers News, Zhang Buzhou from Peking University, and Huang Shiyun from the Workers' Daily.

    首都新闻工作者座谈会结束
    提出许多新闻理论和实际工作中的问题
    本报讯　首都新闻工作者座谈会已经在昨天闭幕。这三天的会议，一天比一天更热烈，到会的人一天比一天多。
    在最后一天的座谈会上，邓季惺主张多办同仁报纸。她说，应该把同仁报纸变成报纸的民主党派，这样可以和党报竞赛，可以减少报道中的主观片面性。
    邓季惺对党报和非党报的待遇不同很有意见。她说，有人说党报是亲儿子，非党报是义子，这话是有根据的。不但记者采访时候受到不同的待遇，就是纸张的分配也有区别。听说分配给人民日报的纸张就超过了实际的需要。非党报的纸张不够用，纸的质量也不好。机器也是这样，党报有高速轮转机，非党报一直用着旧机器。她说，最可笑的是，各报给邮局的发行费一样，都是25％，而邮局只给人民日报捆报，不给大公报捆报。
    老报人毛健吾认为，大公报的记者到处碰钉子，到处受到宗派主义的打击。对这种事情，记者协会一直没有表示过态度。
    毛健吾提出建议说：有些精通编辑业务的老报人，解放以后都改了行，现在是不是可以考虑叫他们归队呢？
    毛健吾主张新闻部门的领导干部要脱鞋下田，要自己写消息发文章，不要整天开会，忙于领导。
    北京大学新闻专业助教陈诗经对学校新闻系的教学工作提出尖锐的批评。他认为现在存在着“新闻教学的危机。”“新闻理论贫乏，教条主义严重。”“新闻教学的危机，实际是新闻理论的危机。”“在教学中，有‘五性一统’，把党性、群众性、思想性、战斗性和指导性统到党性底下，这样一来，把什么生动、活泼的东西都统光了。”因此，学生认为，“与其听教条主义，不如听唯心主义。”
    光明日报记者巴波在会上谈到他对报纸的看法。他说，“报纸是教科书”，这在过去是正确的。现在再这样提，就不一定正确了。虽然这样，可是，现在报纸怎么说，下面还是怎么作。
    人民日报总编辑邓拓认为这个座谈会表示了新闻界“争鸣”的开始。他说，从两三天的发言情况来看，大家的讨论集中在两类问题上。一类是新闻理论问题。比如，新闻的阶级性、商品性、指导性、趣味性和新闻自由、新闻价值等等，各有各的看法，应该深入研究、继续争鸣。还有一类是实际工作问题，应该分析情况，对症下药，采取有效措施，逐步加以解决。
    邓拓说，我国社会的阶级斗争基本结束以后，社会关系发生根本的变化，怎样正确地处理人民内部矛盾，是一个新的课题，我们没有经验，跟不上客观形势的发展。这是许多问题发生的根本原因。
    邓拓说，人民日报编辑部的人员对于自己编辑的报纸并不满意，我们觉得其他各报都有值得我们学习的优点，我们要向别的报纸虚心学习，改进我们的工作。邓拓认为，报馆机关化、官僚化的现象应该改变；许多业务干部应该亲自动手，参加编写工作。邓拓还说，全国记者协会将筹办“新闻学研究”的刊物，作为新闻界争鸣的园地。
    新华社社长吴冷西希望大家多给新华社提意见，帮助新华社的同志们整风。他说，现在新闻界有个很突出的矛盾，就是通讯社和报馆、广播电台的矛盾。 “每个报纸都应该有自己的特点和风格。可是，通讯社、报馆和广播电台还应该分工合作，以免对消和浪费力量。”
    吴冷西说，通讯社本来是应报纸、广播电台的需要而产生的。新华社和报馆、广播电台是合作关系，不是商业关系。过去统一发布某些新闻，是为了适应当时的需要，可是，由于统得过紧、过严、过死，对报纸的不同需要考虑不够，就产生了一些毛病。现在，新华社愿意更好地为报馆和广播电台服务，除了继续发播各个报纸、广播电台有共同兴趣的新闻以外，还打算供给部分专稿，满足它们的特殊需要。
    昨天在会上发言的还有：解放军报胡疵、人民公路报王舜华、新华社北京分社雷鹏、少年报裴毓荪、北京大学张步洲、工人日报黄是云等。
