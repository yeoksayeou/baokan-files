    The Profound Lessons of the Mei Xuanwen Incident
                Our Correspondent Lu Hao
    Editor's Note: The Mei Xuanwen incident exposes the shocking extent of bureaucraticism among some leading personnel. People are constantly shouting against bureaucraticism and deeply abhor it, but these bureaucrats remain indifferent. The person in charge of the Industrial Education Department of the First Ministry of Machine Building was completely unaware of the problems existing at the Shenyang Workers' Technical Normal School. Only after seeing the reporter's稿件 (manuscript, but here it refers to this news article) did they send someone to Shenyang to investigate. Upon their return, this person in charge even told the reporter that the school's principal did not have any major shortcomings. It seems that these people need to further study the Central Committee's instructions on handling contradictions among the people and the spirit of the rectification campaign.
    Bureaucrats are completely unconcerned with the suffering of the masses. An eighteen-year-old youth unfortunately committed suicide.
    On March 28th, the Shenyang Workers' Technical Normal School (hereinafter referred to as Shenyang 工师 - Industrial Normal School) experienced the suicide of Mei Xuanwen.
    Mei Xuanwen was a student in the school's Mathematics 103 class; he was only eighteen years old this year. Why would such a young child commit suicide?
    The course of events was as follows: Last September, the First Ministry of Machine Building established this school in Shenyang to train teachers for the ministry's various technical schools. Due to the school's hasty establishment, the recruited students varied in academic level, which naturally brought about considerable difficulties for the teaching work. On March 22nd, the entire school held a meeting where the principal vaguely stated that in order to accommodate students who wanted to take entrance exams for other schools during the summer vacation, the school would be running a remedial class. However, the principal did not make any clarification at this meeting as to what would happen if students failed to get into those schools. Liu Qiheng, the director of common courses, also announced that students must register for the remedial class within twenty-four hours; otherwise, the school would not be responsible for them. The implication was that it would be considered automatic withdrawal from the school.
    Student Mei Xuanwen had failed two subjects, algebra and politics. After hearing the report, he estimated that he would certainly be among those in the remedial class, and his mood became very agitated. He and his classmates were walking idly on 12th Ma Lu (avenue), and when a bus drove toward them, Mei Xuanwen said, "I might as well let it run me over!" Those with him thought he was joking and did not pay attention. Later, the physics teacher talked to him, saying, "If you want to go, go; if you don't want to go, go home." Seeing that there was no room for discussion, Mei Xuanwen returned to his dormitory, extremely agitated. He burned his books and smashed a bottle of blue ink on the table, splattering ink all over someone else's bedsheet. From that time until the 26th, he barely ate for three consecutive days, only drinking a little water. This situation caused anxiety among the students in the dormitory. Student Zhao Qiang went to notify his family. He encountered Liu Qiheng, the director of common courses, in the classroom corridor. Liu Qiheng said, "There's no need to go; I can talk to him." Liu Qiheng went to Mei Xuanwen's dormitory in the evening and saw him writing in a notebook. He took the notebook and saw these words written on it: "I absolutely won't go to the remedial class. Going home is impossible. There's only death." Under these circumstances, Liu Qiheng not only did not explain or comfort Mei Xuanwen, but instead became furious and scolded Mei Xuanwen, saying, "Who are you trying to scare with this? If you want to die, then die! The school can still function without you!" Liu Qiheng tore off the page and left. The next day, Mei Xuanwen's class teacher asked Liu Qiheng, "How is Mei Xuanwen?" Liu Qiheng said, "I've already talked to him, there shouldn't be any problems." The morning after Liu Qiheng said there wouldn't be any problems, Mei Xuanwen, because he was unwilling to go to the remedial class and felt he had no face to go home, felt that he had no future, could not think straight, and ended his life meaninglessly and unnecessarily.
    The school had already experienced great unrest, but the leaders still thought their domain was perfectly peaceful.
    The school leaders had been kept in the dark and were only now suddenly surprised: How could establishing a remedial class cause such a big problem?
    Before Mei Xuanwen died, the school leadership had always thought that the work of establishing the remedial class was proceeding smoothly. They had given a mobilization speech and had spoken to students individually. Everything seemed calm afterward, without causing any unrest. In reality, the situation was completely contrary to what the school leaders estimated: Because the school had not provided specific arrangements for the future prospects of students going to the remedial class, this caused students extreme anxiety. They wondered: If they don't get into another school during the summer vacation, where will they go? Although the school had designated specific people to talk to students going to the remedial class, the way they conducted the conversations was mostly simplistic and rigid. Although the school affairs meeting had already decided that students with passing grades could skip the remedial class, Principal Wan Xun then arbitrarily overturned this decision, which made matters even more chaotic. A teacher talking to student Li Yuming of Chinese 102 class asked, "Why should I go if my grades are passing?" The teacher mobilizing him said, "Because you're too honest, you don't like to talk. How can you be a teacher in the future if you don't like to talk?" Because the purpose, nature, and future prospects of running the remedial class were not explained clearly, and because extremely simplistic and crude methods were adopted, a pessimistic and despairing atmosphere formed among the students going to the remedial class. Three people in Mei Xuanwen's dormitory were going to the remedial class. Yang Chunzhu cried almost all night, and Mei Xuanwen and Ye Changbai also shed tears. A student living in the next room even tied a leather belt to the top of Mei Xuanwen's bunk bed, pretending to hang himself. However, the leaders of Shenyang Industrial Normal School were completely unaware of all this. They considered this matter, which concerned the vital interests of sixty-two people, to be a trivial matter. They were to meet with students every day, but they didn't know what the students were thinking. The students' dormitories were only a few steps away from them, but they knew nothing about what was happening among the students. The students' wishes had nowhere to be voiced, their distress was不敢向谁暴露 (afraid to reveal to anyone), their difficulties were not resolved for them. They were crying,闹 (making noise) , wanting to live or die; but the bureaucrats of Shenyang Industrial Normal School still thought their domain was perfectly peaceful and still boasted that their work was being done meticulously. In the days before Mei Xuanwen died, some people had asked the principals, and the principals' views were all very optimistic.
    They are people who educate others, but they often treat students with crude methods.
    In such a school, Mei Xuanwen's death was, of course, not a casual event. Some of the school's main staff members simply didn't treat students as their own people. Their treatment of students could not be described as caring, warm, or understanding. They were people who educated others, but they often used intolerably crude and threatening methods as their magic weapon. Li Xiufang of Physics 102 class had written to the school leaders, offering many opinions on the school's work. This January, she wrote another letter to the Minister of the First Ministry of Machine Building. This letter, expressing dissatisfaction with the school leadership, was later forwarded back to the school by the Ministry's General Office, and finally to the class teacher, Wu Yi. This time, Wu Yi was able to grab the weakness. He held the letter in class and said triumphantly: "Look, Li Xiufang went to the central government to complain, she sued back and forth, and in the end, it fell into my hands." This time, Li Xiufang failed one subject, algebra. Wu Yi wanted her to go to the remedial class. She didn't want to go, and Wu Yi said, "What are you? I'll put up a notice and expel you!" This scared Li Xiufang so much that she ran out in the middle of the night, wandering around, wanting to go home, but having no home to return to, wanting to go to Beijing, but having no money to buy a ticket. She had no choice but to return to school in the afternoon. When Wu Yi saw her, he flew into a rage: "You're small, but you have a lot of tricks. You still want to use this to scare the school!" Wu Yi worked using such methods. Another student in 102 class, Su Weizhou, failed one subject. Class teacher Wu Yi wanted him to go to the remedial class, but he didn't go, so the class held a meeting to criticize him. Su Weizhou and Li Xiufang pleaded with teacher Wu Yi, saying, "We will definitely work hard to catch up. We believe we can catch up." Originally, temporarily staying with the original class was in accordance with the Ministry of Higher Education's regulations on the examination methods for secondary specialized schools' semester examinations and academic year (promotion) examinations, but Wu Yi did not agree. As a result, their two seats were canceled, and the class no longer wanted them to clean up. They were not allowed to take leave, textbooks were not issued to them, and they were not allowed to participate in elections. In short, a student's basic rights were deprived by Wu Yi. Wu Yi could do whatever he wanted, and his power was astonishing.
    Bureaucrats continue to treat their mistakes with a bureaucratic attitude, which makes it impossible to solve the problem quickly.
    Why could people like Liu Qiheng and Wu Yi be so arbitrary in this school? Why could Wan Xun, the principal of Shenyang Industrial Normal School and the secretary of the Party's general branch, be so tolerant of such things? Why did the Party organization of this school behave so numbly and lose its fighting spirit before and after the Mei Xuanwen incident? Principal Wan Xun was not unaware of what these people were doing. The problem was that he didn't think these were anything serious, so he neither conducted serious research on these issues nor took a resolute attitude to stop them. In some respects, he even condoned the development of the situation. Because many principles in dealing with the remedial class were determined by him.
    The degree of detachment from the masses of the school's Party organization was also very shocking. When the masses' thoughts were very confused, the Party organization knew nothing. They only knew that one student was unwilling to go to the remedial class and was crying, but this did not attract their attention at all. They saw things very simply and felt that there was no need to worry. They usually knew something about the overbearing behavior of some staff members in the school towards students, but they were indifferent and did not interfere. Although there had been some disagreements in dealing with the remedial class issue, they were unable to adhere to the correct opinions. They usually didn't understand or investigate the masses' ideological trends; they were ignorant of the masses' wishes and demands, and they didn't care about the masses' pain and grievances. In a word, the weapon of ideological work was forgotten by the Party organization here.
    However, things are not just like that. Logically speaking, the fact that the Tiexi District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League had sent people in charge to help with the work should have aroused the vigilance of the school's leadership. This was not the case. Wan Xun happened to be in Beijing attending a meeting at the Ministry before Mei Xuanwen died. When Wan Xun returned from Beijing, people hoped that he could take this opportunity to seriously check and rectify the school's work. However, Wan Xun did not do this. Instead of humbly summing up lessons with a spirit of self-criticism together with the comrades from the District Committee and the Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League to improve the work, he secretly said that the arrival of people from the District Committee and the Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League not only did not solve the problem, but also had a negative impact on the students and created many difficulties for the school's future work. It should be added here that Shenyang Industrial Normal School's superior is the Industrial Education Department of the First Ministry of Machine Building in Beijing, and its Party organization belongs to the leadership of the Tiexi District Committee of Shenyang City. The school's administrative work is directly dealt with by the Industrial Education Department of the First Ministry of Machine Building in Beijing, which makes Wan Xun seem to only see his immediate superiors. Because Wan Xun has such an incorrect attitude, the thoughts below are, of course, even more confused. After the Mei Xuanwen incident, people in charge of the District Committee and the Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League went to the school to check the work. Some said: "You usually don't care, but when something happens, you specifically come to talk to the naughty students." Some said: "Things are not that big. Mei Xuanwen died by himself. Is the District Committee and the Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League taking the problem too seriously?" Someone said: "Why don't you talk to the teachers first? Will talking to the students first stir things up?" Even some members of the Party's general branch said this. Everyone had a different opinion, in a chaotic mess. Even now, the leaders of Shenyang Industrial Normal School are still unwilling to honestly conduct self-criticism to the masses, and they are still covering up and trying to muddle through. The seriousness of the problem lies here: the bureaucrats in the leadership of Shenyang Industrial Normal School are still continuing to treat their mistakes with a bureaucratic attitude. These days, they have heard the transmission of Chairman Mao's speech at the Supreme State Council, which should have made their minds clearer. But this is not the case. Chairman Mao's speech did not attract their attention, and things are still developing. Now there are seven students who should have gone to the remedial class according to the school's regulations, but they didn't go. A few days ago, the school made another decision, which was to allow these seven students to try to study in the original class, but those who failed the summer vacation exam would automatically withdraw from the school. Later, the school asked the students to write an application form, but the students were unwilling to write it. The school wanted them to write it, and the matter is currently at a standstill.
    It is not easy for bureaucrats to recognize their mistakes. The First Ministry of Machine Building must continue to conduct in-depth investigations into this incident.
    It is quite clear that the Mei Xuanwen incident was mainly caused by bureaucraticism in the leadership. But judging from the current situation, it is still very difficult for the school's leadership to recognize their bureaucratic mistakes, and it is not easy to fight against such bureaucrats. After the Mei Xuanwen incident broke out, the superior Party and Communist Youth League organizations came to help them, but until now, there is no sign that they have the determination to recognize and correct their mistakes. Some people even think that things were not serious at all, but that the superior authorities made them serious. It seems that the school itself had no contradictions, and the contradictions were incited by the people who came from the superior authorities. This is certainly not the case.
    From the Mei Xuanwen incident, bureaucraticism mostly occurs in places where the Party's leadership is relatively weak and democratic life is relatively abnormal. The situation at Shenyang Industrial Normal School is like this. The school's administrative leadership is thousands of miles away and rarely provides specific leadership; the local authorities also feel that this is a unit directly under the central government and rarely intervene, so the school lacks strong leadership from the higher levels, coupled with the usual refusal to accept supervision from the masses. Therefore, bureaucraticism can live here in peace and without interference. Before and after the Mei Xuanwen incident, the students of this school had fought against the bureaucraticism of the leadership, but because they lacked support, there were no results. The Mei Xuanwen incident shows that strengthening the Party's leadership over such units is a very urgent task.
    The Mei Xuanwen incident is only one aspect of the bureaucraticism exposed in the leadership of Shenyang Industrial Normal School. There are also some other noteworthy problems in this school. We hope that the Liaoning Provincial Committee, the Shenyang Municipal Committee, and the relevant departments of the First Ministry of Machine Building will promptly conduct a comprehensive inspection of these problems that have occurred in Shenyang Industrial Normal School, so that the bureaucrats receive the punishment they deserve!

    梅宣文事件的沉痛教训
                本报记者　陆灏
    编者按：梅宣文事件暴露了某些领导人员的官僚主义的严重程度是十分令人吃惊的。人们天天在喊反对官僚主义，对于官僚主义是那样深恶痛绝，但这些官僚主义分子仍然是那样无动于衷。第一机械工业部工业教育司的负责人事前根本不知道沈阳工人技术师范学校存在着问题，直到看到记者的稿件之后，才派人去沈阳了解。了解回来，这位负责人还对记者说，这个学校的校长并没有什么大缺点。看来，这些人对中央处理人民内部矛盾的指示和整风的精神，还需要进一步学习。
    官僚主义者根本不关心群众的痛痒，一个十八岁的青年不幸自杀了。
    3月28日，沈阳工人技术师范学校（以下简称沈阳工师）发生了梅宣文自杀事件。
    梅宣文是这个学校数学一○三班的学生，他今年才十八岁。一个年轻轻的孩子为什么要自杀呢？
    事情的经过是这样的：去年9月，第一机械工业部在沈阳市成立了这个为本部各技工学校培养师资的学校。由于学校成立得仓促，招来的学生水平参差不齐，这给教学工作自然带来了不少困难。3月22日全校开了个大会，校长含含糊糊地说为了照顾同学在暑假好考别的学校，学校要办个补习班。但如果考不取学校怎么办，校长在这个会上根本没有作什么交代。普通学科主任刘启恒并宣布在二十四小时内去补习班的学生必须报到；否则学校对他们不负责任。意思是说，那就算自动退学。
    学生梅宣文有两门功课不及格，一门是代数，一门是政治。他听完报告，估计补习班的名额中必有自己，心情就很波动。他和同学们在十二马路闲走，迎面开来一辆公共汽车，梅宣文说：“不如让它撞死！”同行的人以为说着玩，没有引起注意。后来物理老师找他谈话说：“你去就去，不去就回家。”梅宣文眼看没有商量的余地，回到寝室，情绪十分激动，他烧掉了自己的书籍，把桌上的一瓶蓝墨水摔得粉碎，墨水溅了别人一床单。从那时候起，直到26日，连续三天他不大吃饭，只是喝一点水。这种情形引起了寝室里同学们的不安，赵强同学要去通知他的家庭。他走到教室走廊里，碰上了普通学科主任刘启恒，刘启恒说：“用不着去，我找他谈谈就可以。”刘启恒晚上到了梅宣文的寝室，见他在笔记本上写字，他拿过本子来，看见上面写着这几句话：“补习班坚决不去，回家不可能，只有死路一条。”在这种情形之下，刘启恒不但没有对梅宣文进行解释和安慰，反而勃然大怒训斥梅宣文说：“你写这个吓唬谁？你死就死吧！学校少了你也能成立！”刘启恒撕下这张纸就走了。第二天梅宣文的班主任问刘启恒：“梅宣文怎么样？”刘启恒说：“我已经和他谈过了，不会有什么问题的。”就在刘启恒说不会有什么问题的第二天早晨，梅宣文因为不愿意去补习班，也觉得没有脸回家，觉得自己没有前途，他想不开，就这样毫无意义地不应该地结束了自己的生命。
    学校已经发生了很大的波动，可是领导者还以为自己的天下十分太平呢。
    学校的领导者一直好像蒙在鼓里，到这时候才突然吃惊起来：成立补习班，怎么会出这样大的问题？
    在梅宣文没有死之前，学校的领导方面还一直以为成立补习班这件工作进行得很顺利，做了动员报告，也一个一个分头谈过话，事后也很平静，没有引起什么波动。实际上，事情和学校的领导者们估计完全相反：由于学校对去补习班的同学出路没有具体地安排，这就使同学们感到极大的不安。他们想：到了暑假，如果考不上别的学校，这上哪儿去？学校虽然指定专人和去补习班的同学谈了话，但谈话的方式大多是简单和生硬的。本来在校务会议上已经决定平时成绩及格的同学可以不去补习班，可是这时候校长万训擅自推翻了这个决议，这就使事情更加混乱了。有个老师找语文一○二班李玉明同学谈话，李玉明问：“我的功课都及格，为什么要我去？”动员他的老师说：“因为你太老实，不爱说话，将来当老师，不爱说话怎么能行？”由于一来没有把办补习班的目的、性质和出路详细交代清楚，二来又采取了极其简单和粗暴的办法，这就在去补习班的同学中形成了一种悲观失望的空气。梅宣文的寝室里有三个人去补习班，杨纯柱几乎哭了一整夜，梅宣文和叶长柏也流了眼泪。住在隔壁房间的一个同学还在梅宣文的双层床头上拴了根皮带，装作上吊的样子。但是，这一切情形，沈阳工师的领导者们一点也不知道，他们把这一件关系着六十二个人的切身利益的事情看成是一件无关紧要的小事情。他们天天要和学生见面，但就不知道学生们的心里在想些什么，学生们的宿舍离他们没几步远，但学生中发生的事情他们一点也不知道。学生们的愿望没有地方申诉，苦闷不敢向谁暴露，疑难没有人为他们解答，他们在哭在闹，要死要活；但沈阳工师的官僚主义分子还以为自己的天下十分太平，还在夸耀他们的工作做得蛮细致，在梅宣文没有死的前几天，有人还问过校长们，校长们的看法都是很乐观的。
    他们是教育别人的人，但却经常用粗暴手段对待学生。
    在这样的学校里，梅宣文的死当然并不是一件什么偶然的事件。这个学校某些主要的工作人员，他们根本不把学生当作自己人，他们对待学生根本谈不到什么关心、温暖和体谅，他们是教育别人的人，但却经常以难以容忍的粗暴和威胁的手段作为自己的法宝。物理一○二班的李秀芳给学校的领导者写过信，对于学校的工作提过不少的意见。今年1月，她又给第一机械工业部的部长同志写过信，这一封对于学校的领导表示不满的信，后来由部的办公厅转回到学校，最后又转到班主任吴一的手里，这一下子吴一可算抓住了小辫子，他在班上拿了这封信很得意地说过：你们看李秀芳到中央去告状，她告来告去，结果还是告到我的手里了。这次，李秀芳有一门代数不及格，吴一要她去补习班，她不去，吴一说：“你是什么玩意儿，我出榜开除你！”这可把李秀芳吓坏了，半夜三更，她跑了出去，四处乱转，想回家，没有家可回，想去北京，没有钱买车票，不得已到了下午又回到学校。吴一见了她暴跳如雷：“你人小，花招不少，你还想拿这来吓唬学校呢。”吴一就是靠这样的办法来工作的。一○二班另外一个学生苏维周，他有一门功课不及格，班主任吴一要他去补习班，他没去，班上就开会斗争他。苏维周和李秀芳向吴一老师恳求说：“我们一定努力追，我们相信一定能追得上的。”本来，暂随原班学习，是符合高等教育部关于中等专业学校学期考试及学年（升级）考试办法的规定的，可是吴一不答应。于是，他们两个人的座位被取消了，班上也不要他们两个人打扫清洁了，他们要请假也不理，讲义也不发给他们，选举也不要他们参加。总之，一个学生的普通的权利都被吴一剥夺了。吴一想怎么干，他就可以怎么干，其权力之大，令人惊异。
    官僚主义分子继续用官僚主义的态度对待自己的错误，这就使得问题不能迅速解决。
    为什么像刘启恒、吴一这样的人能够在这个学校里为所欲为呢？作为沈阳工师的校长、党的总支书记的万训为什么能对这样的事情表示如此容忍呢？在梅宣文事件的前前后后，为什么这个学校的党的组织竟表现得这样麻木不仁和丧失了战斗力呢？校长万训对于这些人的所作所为并不是不了解的，问题是在于他认为这些都并不是什么了不起的事情，所以他既不对这些问题进行认真的研究，更谈不到采取坚决的态度加以制止，在某些方面，甚至是默许了事态的发展。因为处理补习班时很多原则都是他确定的。
    这个学校的党的组织，脱离群众的程度也是很惊人的，当群众思想情况十分混乱的时候，党组织竟然一无所知，他们只知道有一个同学不愿去补习班，哭了，但根本没有引起他们的注意，他们把事情看得很简单，觉得毋须担忧。对于学校内某些工作人员对待学生强横霸道的行为平常也是知道一些的，但他们无动于衷，不加干预。对于补习班问题的处理虽然也有过一些分歧，但没有能够坚持正确的意见，他们平常对于群众的思想动向不了解，不调查；对于群众的愿望和要求，茫然不知，对于群众的痛苦和委屈毫不关心。一句话，思想工作的武器被这里的党的组织忘记了。
    但是，事情还不仅仅就是如此。按理说，梅宣文的事件发生后，中共铁西区委和青年团沈阳市委都派了负责人来帮助做工作，这就很应该引起学校领导方面的警觉了。事实并不是这样，梅宣文死之前，万训恰巧到北京部里开会去了，等到万训从北京回来，人们都希望他能借此机会，好好检查和整顿一下学校的工作。但是，万训并没有这样做，他非但没有和区委、团市委的同志们在一起好好虚心地用自我批评的精神总结教训，以改进工作。反而背后表示：区委、团市委来了人，不但没有解决问题，反而在学生中起了副作用，对学校今后工作造成很多困难。这里要附带地说明一下，沈阳工师的上级是北京第一机械工业部工业教育司，它的党的组织是属于沈阳市铁西区委领导。学校的行政业务工作，都是同北京第一机械工业部工业教育司直来直去打交道的，这就使得万训的眼睛里好像只看得见自己的顶头上司。由于万训有这样的不正确的态度，下面的思想当然也就更加混乱。梅宣文事件发生以后，区委、团市委负责人到学校去检查工作，有的就说：平常不管，出了事情就专门来找调皮捣蛋的学生谈话。有的说：事情并没有这么大，梅宣文是自己死的，区委、团市委是不是把问题看得太严重了。有人说：为什么不先找老师谈话？先找学生是不是会鼓起事来？连有的党的总支委员也是这样说，一个人一个意见，纷纷乱乱。直到现在，沈阳工师的领导还是不肯向群众老老实实进行自我批评，还是遮遮掩掩，想把事情蒙混过去，稀里胡涂就算了。问题的严重性就在这里，沈阳工师领导上的官僚主义分子还在继续用官僚主义的态度对待自己的错误。这几天，他们已经听到了毛主席在最高国务会议讲话的传达，这无论如何应该使他们的头脑有所清醒了。但事实并非如此，毛主席的讲话并未引起他们的注意，事情还在继续发展，现在有七个按照学校规定的原则应该去补习班的同学没有去补习班，前几天学校又作了个决定，这个决定是准许这七个同学在原班试读，但到暑假考试时不及格者，自己就应自动退学。后来，学校又要学生写一张申请书，学生不愿意写，校方要他们写，这件事情目前还在僵持中。
    要官僚主义分子认识错误并不容易，第一机械工业部对于这一事件必须继续深入检查。
    十分显然，梅宣文事件主要是由于领导上的官僚主义造成的。但就目前的情况来看，要学校领导上认识自己的官僚主义错误，这还是一件非常困难的事情，和这样的官僚主义分子作斗争还并不是一件很容易的事情。梅宣文事件爆发后，上级党、团的组织都来帮助他们，但直到现在还看不到他们有认识和纠正自己错误的决心。甚至还有人认为事情本来并不严重，而是上级机关把它制造得严重了。似乎学校本身本来没有什么矛盾，矛盾是上级机关来的人鼓动起来的。实际当然不是这样。
    从梅宣文事件看，官僚主义大多发生在党的领导比较薄弱、民主生活比较不正常的地方，沈阳工师的情况便是如此。这个学校的行政领导机关在千里以外，平时很少具体的领导；地方上又觉得这是中央直属的单位，平时也很少过问，因此学校既缺乏上级有力的领导，加以平常拒绝群众的监督，因此官僚主义就能在这里安居乐业，不受干扰。梅宣文事件发生前后，这个学校的学生曾和领导上的官僚主义作过一些斗争，但因缺乏支持，也就没有什么结果。梅宣文的事件说明，加强党对这样一些单位的领导，是一件十分迫切的任务。
    梅宣文事件只不过是沈阳工师领导上官僚主义暴露的一方面，这个学校在其他方面同时还存在着一些值得注意的问题。我们希望辽宁省委、沈阳市委和第一机械工业部的有关部门，对于沈阳工师发生的这些问题迅速进行全面的检查，使官僚主义分子受到应得的惩戒！
