The NPC Standing Committee and Directly Subordinate Institutions of the State Council Determine Rectification Methods:
　　Repeated Mobilization, Dispelling Concerns, Increasing Confidence
　　Ministry of Agriculture Focuses on Opposing Subjectivism in Production Guidance

　　(Our dispatch) On the afternoon of May 4th, Comrade Xi Zhongxun convened a meeting of the Party Group Secretaries and administrative Party member responsible comrades of the NPC Standing Committee organs and directly subordinate institutions of the State Council, reviewed the progress of the rectification movement, and specifically studied how to implement the Central Committee's instructions on the rectification movement. Currently, ten units have drafted rectification plans and established rectification leading groups headed by Party Group Secretaries or administrative Party member responsible comrades, while the remaining units are also in the process of forming rectification leading groups and formulating rectification plans. In formulating rectification plans, each unit, based on its respective business nature and scope of work, has determined its own priorities regarding the main content of the rectification, focusing on thoroughly examining bureaucraticism, sectarianism, and subjectivism in the implementation of policies and guidelines through summarizing work, and improving the handling of various contradictions within the people and within the organs.

　　The meeting believed that, in order for this rectification movement to truly achieve the goals of improving ideology, improving work style, improving work, and strengthening unity, first, it is necessary to implement the principles and policies in the Party Central Committee's instructions on the rectification movement, repeatedly mobilize, break through ideological barriers, dispel concerns, and increase confidence; second, it is necessary to start from summarizing work. The examination and summary of work must have priorities, and should generally focus on examining major issues involving policies and guidelines related to contradictions among the people, supplemented by organizational life. At the same time, it is also necessary to link it with clarifying the scope of each unit's business, improving working relationships, improving work methods, work systems, as well as increasing production and practicing economy, administrative systems, and organizational staffing. Third, the rectification should focus on leading Party cadres, and there should also be different rectification requirements for young cadres and general cadres, adopting different learning methods so that all cadres can be universally educated and universally improved in the rectification movement. Fourth, in order for the rectification movement to achieve practical results, leading cadres must take personal responsibility, promote democracy, seek truth from facts, distinguish right from wrong, and prescribe the right medicine.

　　The meeting also made preliminary studies on the methods and steps of rectification.

　　The meeting discussed how to strengthen ideological and organizational leadership in the rectification. The meeting finally decided to form a rectification leading group for the Party organizations of the State Council's directly subordinate institutions, headed by Comrade Xi Zhongxun.

　　(Our dispatch) The person in charge of the Party Group of the Central Ministry of Agriculture told reporters: Judging from the problems that have been exposed so far, the main contradiction between the Ministry of Agriculture and the broad masses is subjectivism in production guidance. This rectification will focus on solving this problem.

　　Since the Ministry of Agriculture conveyed Chairman Mao's speech in early March, various units have successively held multiple forums and discussions. The study initially revealed some contradictions, the most important of which is the existence of bureaucracy and subjectivism in agricultural production guidance. For example, plans are not realistic, technology promotion cannot be adapted to local conditions, the promotion of double-wheeled double-shared plows is too large, and the allocation of varieties is not suitable, etc.

　　Manifested in the contradictions between leaders and those being led, sometimes the leader's requirements are inconsistent with the subordinates' understanding or work level, and the leader lacks specific assistance, so that the problem cannot be solved quickly. For example, the Plant Quarantine Regulations were drafted fourteen times, and the leader only said it was not good, but did not point out where it was not good, so it could not be issued for a long time. Sometimes the requirements are too high and unrealistic. Many agricultural business reports have too much content and too much detail to complete.

　　The person in charge of the Party Group believes that the problems exposed in the past stage of study are only the beginning. Through this rectification, more and more important problems will be exposed. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the Party Group's leadership over the rectification, improve the ideological level of cadres through the rectification, so that bureaucracy and subjectivism can be reduced or avoided in future work.

    人大常委会机关和国务院直属机构确定整风办法
    反复动员　解除顾虑　提高信心
    农业部着重反对生产指导上的主观主义
    本报讯　本月4日下午，习仲勋同志召开了全国人民代表大会常委会机关和国务院直属机构的党组书记及行政党员负责同志的会议，检查了整风运动的开展情况，并且具体研究了如何贯彻执行中央关于整风运动的指示。目前已经有十个单位拟订了整风计划，成立了以党组书记或行政党员负责同志为领导的整风领导小组，其余的单位亦正在酝酿成立整风领导小组和制订整风计划。各单位在制订整风计划中，对于整风的主要内容，都根据各自的不同业务性质，工作范围，确定了各自的重点，着重从总结工作中来彻底检查执行政策方针中的官僚主义、宗派主义、主观主义，改进处理人民内部和机关内部的各种矛盾问题。
    会议认为：为使此次整风运动能够真正达到提高思想、改进作风、改善工作、加强团结的目的，首先，必须贯彻党中央整风运动指示中的方针、原则，反复动员，打通思想，解除顾虑，提高信心；其次，必须从总结工作入手。检查总结工作中必须要有重点，一般都应该以检查涉及人民内部矛盾的政策方针的重大问题为主，以机关生活为辅。同时，也要同划清各单位的业务范围，改进工作关系，改善工作方法、工作制度以及增产节约，行政体制，机构编制等方面的工作联系起来进行。第三，整风以党的领导干部为主，对于青年干部和一般干部也要有不同的整风要求，采取不同的学习方法，使全体干部都能够在整风运动中普遍受到教育，普遍得到提高。第四，整风运动要获得实际效果，必须领导干部亲自负责，发扬民主，实事求是，分清是非，对症下药。
    会议对整风的方式方法和步骤问题也作了初步研究。
    会议讨论了如何加强整风中的思想领导和组织领导问题。会议最后确定了以习仲勋同志为首组成国务院直属机构党组织的整风领导小组。
    本报讯　中央农业部党组负责人告诉记者说：就目前已经暴露的问题来看，农业部和广大群众的主要矛盾是在生产指导上的主观主义。这次整风中将着重解决这个问题。
    农业部从3月初传达毛主席的讲话以后，各单位先后进行了多次座谈、讨论。学习中初步揭露出了一些矛盾，其中最主要的是在农业生产指导上存在着官僚主义和主观主义。如计划不切合实际，推广技术不能因地制宜，推广双轮双铧犁计划过大，品种调配不适宜等。
    表现在领导和被领导者之间的矛盾，有的是领导上的要求和下级的认识或工作水平不一致，而领导上又缺乏具体帮助，使问题不能很快解决。如植物检疫条例起草了十四次，领导上只说不行，但没有指出那里不行，以致迟迟发不出去。有的是要求过高，不切合实际。很多农业业务报表内容太多太细，无法完成。
    党组负责人认为过去这一阶段学习中所暴露的问题只是个开始，通过这次整风，还将暴露出更多更重要的问题，为此，必须加强党组对整风的领导，通过整风提高干部思想水平，使以后工作中能够减少或避免再犯官僚主义和主观主义。
