    Beijing Cancels Free Vegetable Market
    Starting May 6th, Beijing has cancelled the free vegetable market. In the week before the implementation of this measure, the municipal authorities conducted publicity and explanation to vegetable vendors and self-producing and selling farmers; however, on May 6th, some vegetable vendors and farmers still transported and sold vegetables, and these vegetables have all been uniformly purchased by state-owned vegetable companies at state-set prices.
    Beijing's vegetable supply mainly relies on suburban production. Since 1954, Beijing has gradually made planned arrangements for suburban vegetable production; by 1956, 80% of suburban vegetables were supplied through state-owned companies. However, some unlicensed vegetable vendors and farmers blindly flowing into Beijing from other places (who in the past mostly traded in state-controlled materials such as scrap copper and peanuts) purchased vegetables from suburban agricultural cooperatives at prices about twice as high as those of state-owned companies, and then sold them at high prices in the market, which prevented agricultural cooperatives from properly fulfilling their contracts with state-owned companies, and the planned supply of the market was affected, which consumers greatly resented. Therefore, Beijing decided to classify vegetables as materials not allowed to be traded in the free market, and stipulated that state-owned retail units, collective catering groups, and small peddlers with joint purchase and sales must purchase goods through state-owned vegetable companies or be linked to designated agricultural cooperatives for supply; if unlicensed peddlers or self-producing and selling farmers re-transport and sell vegetables, the state-owned companies will purchase them at state-set prices. In this way, vegetable producers can still obtain reasonable benefits, and consumers will not suffer.
    According to statistics from only 25 markets in the city, there are approximately 1,000 merchants operating vegetables; after these vendors are eliminated, state-owned companies need to organize forces well to strengthen the purchase and supply of vegetables (especially during the off-season of vegetable production). Most of these vendors are farmers from other places, and the government will mobilize them to return to their hometowns to engage in production; as for the unlicensed vegetable vendors in Beijing, arrangements will also be made according to the specific circumstances.

### 北京市取消蔬菜自由市场

    北京市取消蔬菜自由市场
    北京市从5月6日起，取消了蔬菜的自由市场。市政当局在这项措施执行前的一周中，就向菜贩和自产自销的农民进行了宣传解释；但是，5月6日仍有部分菜贩和农民运销菜蔬，这些菜蔬已经全部由国营菜蔬公司按照国家牌价统一收购。
    北京市蔬菜主要依靠郊区生产供应。从1954年以来，北京市已逐步对郊区菜蔬生产作了有计划的安排；到1956年，郊区菜蔬已有80％通过国营公司衔接供应。但是，仍有部分无牌照菜贩和外地盲目流入北京的农民（他们过去多是买卖杂铜、花生等国家统购物资的）以高出国营公司牌价一倍左右的价钱收购郊区农业社的菜蔬，然后到市场上高价出售，使农业社不能很好地执行它们同国营公司签订的合同，市场有计划的供应也就受到了影响，消费者对这很有意见。因此，北京市决定将菜蔬列为不允许自由市场经营的物资，并规定国营零售单位、集体伙食团体和联购联销小贩必须通过国营菜蔬公司进货或者同指定的农业社挂钩供应；无照小贩或自产自销农民如果再贩运蔬菜，就由国营公司按牌价收购。这样做，蔬菜生产者仍能得到合理的利益，消费者也不至于吃亏。
    仅据全市二十五个市场统计，经营菜蔬的商贩大约有一千人左右；取缔这些菜贩以后，就需要国营公司很好地组织力量加强蔬菜的收购和供应（特别是在蔬菜生产的淡季）。这些菜贩大部分是外地农民，政府将动员他们回乡生产；至于北京市的无照菜贩，也将根据具体情况加以安排。
