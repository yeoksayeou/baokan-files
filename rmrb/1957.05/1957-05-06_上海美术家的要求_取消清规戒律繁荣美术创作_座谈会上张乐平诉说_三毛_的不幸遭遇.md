Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 5th. Cartoonist Zhang Leping spoke candidly about the unfortunate experiences of "Sanmao" at a symposium for artists held by the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on the 3rd. He said that before liberation, his "Sanmao the Vagrant," which exposed the darkness of the old society, was welcomed by readers from all walks of life. After liberation, he wanted to continue depicting "Sanmao's" changes in the new society, and held many symposiums, but all were fruitless. Some people said that "Sanmao" was a lumpen proletariat and not worth drawing anymore. Others said that "Sanmao" had too few hairs, only three, which was a sign of malnutrition, and that the liberated "Sanmao" should be fatter. If it were changed like that, "Sanmao's" life among the masses would be over. A party member even criticized "Sanmao the Vagrant," equating it to "The Life of Wu Xun." When he was drawing "Sanmao's Emancipation," the newspaper asked him to combine his work with political movements such as "Land Reform," "Resist America, Aid Korea," and "Suppress Counter-revolutionaries." As a result, the drawing became very constrained, "Sanmao's" image was also very bad, and it did not leave as deep an impression on society as in the past.

At this symposium, many artists criticized the various rules and restrictions that are currently hindering the flourishing of fine arts. They believe that a key to promoting fine arts creation is to open up avenues for artistic works. There are only two ways out for an artist's work: publication and selling paintings. Woodcarver Chen Yanqiao said that the walls of many public places in Shanghai are empty, and very few works of art are hung. The works of painters' hard work cannot be sold. In terms of publishing, Shanghai only has one fine arts publishing house, and once an artist's work is rejected, there is nowhere else to send it. Even if it is published, the royalty system is not entirely reasonable. Some are not even enough to "break even". Many painters feel that they are "stuck" when they go deep into life. One painter went to the Huangpu River to sketch and the water police said they had discovered a suspicious boat. A painter took a picture by the side of the road and was even searched. Going to factories to experience life or collect creative materials is also impossible due to excessive secrecy. Some units even require painters to write autobiographies before they can enter.

The painters also put forward many positive suggestions for the prosperity of the fine arts. They said that there are more than a thousand art workers in Shanghai, and if this team is mobilized, it will surely produce many flowers. Painter Liu Haisu suggested re-establishing an art academy in Shanghai. He said that Shanghai has a deep artistic tradition, concentrates many folk artists, and many domestic and foreign art works are often exhibited here. These are the most favorable conditions for establishing an art academy. Some painters hope that relevant departments will help many talented painters get rid of administrative affairs and specialize in creation. More than 600 art workers in Shanghai have not yet been properly arranged. No one leads these people in their studies, and their artistic level cannot be improved, which deserves the attention of the leadership. Others suggested that there are many painters in Shanghai and that there is enough strength to start art publications, so that they can have their own arena for debate.

    上海美术家的要求
    取消清规戒律繁荣美术创作
    座谈会上张乐平诉说“三毛”的不幸遭遇
    新华社上海5日电　漫画家张乐平3日在中共上海市委召开的美术家座谈会上，畅谈了“三毛”的不幸遭遇。他说：他在解放前画的以揭露旧社会黑暗为主题的“三毛流浪记”，受到各方面读者的欢迎。解放后他想继续画“三毛”在新社会中的变化，开了多次座谈会，都无结果。有人说：“三毛”是流氓无产阶级，不值得再画。还有人说：“三毛”三根毛太少，是营养不足的表现，解放了的“三毛”应该胖起来。如果这样一改，“三毛”在群众中的生命就完了。有位党员还批评“三毛流浪记”，等于“武训传”。他在画“三毛翻身记”时，报社又要他的作品结合“土改”、“抗美援朝”、“镇反”等政治运动，结果画得很拘束，“三毛”的形象也很糟，没有过去那样在社会上留下深刻的印象。
    在这个座谈会上，许多画家对目前阻碍美术之花盛开的各种清规戒律提出批评。他们认为，繁荣美术创作的一个关键，是要为美术作品打开出路。画家的作品，出路不外两条，一是出版，一是卖画。木刻家陈烟桥说：上海许多公共场所四壁皆空，很少看到悬挂美术作品。画家辛勤劳动的作品卖不出去。在出版方面，上海只有一家美术出版社，画家的作品一经退稿，就无处可送。即使出版，稿费制度也不尽合理。有的连“保本”也不够。不少画家认为他们深入生活，真是“寸步难行”。有位画家到黄浦江去写生，水上警察说：发现了一只可疑的船。一位画家在路旁照了张相，竟然遭到搜查。到工厂去体验生活或搜集创作素材，也因保密太严不得其门而入。有的单位甚至要画家写了自传才能入门。
    画家们还提出了许多繁荣美术事业的积极建议。他们说上海有一千多美术工作者，这支队伍发动起来，一定可放出许许多多花朵。画家刘海粟建议在上海重新设立一个美术学院。他说：上海具有深厚的艺术传统，集中着许多民间艺人，国内外的许多美术作品经常在这里展览，这些都是设立美术学院最有利的条件。有的画家希望有关部门帮助许多有才华的画家摆脱行政事务，专门从事创作。上海有六百多美术工作者还未得到适当安排，这些人学习无人领导，艺术水平也无从提高，值得引起领导上重视。还有人建议上海画家较多，有充分力量创办美术刊物，这样有了自己争鸣的园地。
