    Proposal to Establish a Northwest Scientific Research Center
    Abstract of Written Statement by Committee Member Zhang Dayu
    Recently, I had the opportunity to visit the Northwest of our motherland—Lanzhou and other places. Although the time was short and the places visited were few, I gained a lot of education from the vigorously developing socialist construction. I would like to offer my humble opinions for your research and discussion.
    The Northwest region is vast and rich in resources, both above and below ground, and is one of the important bases for our country's economic construction. This is well known to all committee members. The Academy of Sciences established the Preparatory Committee of the Northwest Branch in 1954. In the past two years, it has also begun to prepare for the construction of a research base in Lanzhou, the central industrial city connecting Xinjiang, Qinghai, and Tibet. This is very much in line with the needs of our country's scientific undertakings and has broad prospects for development. However, the scope of work, development direction, etc. are not very clear.
    As a chemical scientist, I deeply feel that there are a large number of scientific problems in the field of chemical engineering in the Northwest region that urgently need to be solved by scientists. For example, in the future, during the extraction process of new and old oilfields in Xinjiang, Qaidam, and Yumen areas, it will be necessary to find out the flow patterns of oil in different strata, the relationship between oil and gas under high pressure, etc. Also, Qinghai's salt lakes (the salt reserves of only five lakes such as Chaka reach 20 billion tons!), Tibet's borax lakes (reserves of over 30 million tons!) all require research on phase diagram problems, etc. The solution of these problems will undoubtedly make a significant contribution to socialist construction, and at the same time, greatly enrich the scientific treasure trove of the motherland and the world.
    I believe that the scientific prosperity of the motherland should be the result of scientists' labor coming from practice and going back to practice. In other words, we should not only absorb the advanced scientific and technological achievements of various countries in the world, but also combine them with the actual situation of our country's natural resources and production, so that science can take root, grow, blossom, and bear fruit on our land. The Northwest region is precisely a virgin land that urgently needs to be developed. Scientific research institutions, especially the institutions of the Academy of Sciences, do not necessarily have to be located in the production areas, but it is beneficial to be closer to the production areas and closer to actual life. Moreover, there are universities such as Lanzhou University in the Northwest, as well as research institutions of the Ministry of Geology, the Ministry of Petroleum, and other industrial departments that can cooperate. I suggest that the Academy of Sciences, the Ministry of Higher Education, and relevant industrial departments gradually and steadily establish a Northwest Scientific Research Center in Lanzhou based on the conditions.

    建议建立西北科学研究中心
    张大煜委员书面发言摘要
    最近，我有机会到祖国的西北——兰州等地参观，虽为时甚短，所到之处不多，但从蓬勃开展的社会主义建设中获得了很多教益，愿将一得之愚供各位研究讨论。
    西北地区广阔，地上地下资源丰富，是我国经济建设的重要基地之一，这是各位委员所熟知的。科学院在1954年成立了西北分院筹备委员会，两年来，在联通新疆、青海、西藏的中心工业城市兰州又开始筹建研究基地，这是十分切合我国科学事业需要并且具有辽阔发展前途的。但关于工作范围、发展方向等等都很不明确。
    作为一个化学科学工作者，我深感西北地区有大量化学化工领域的科学问题迫待科学家来解决。例如，新疆、柴达木和玉门地区新旧油田将来在开采过程中都需要寻求石油在不同地层中的流动规律，高压下油气关系等等；又如，青海的盐湖（仅茶卡等五个湖的盐储量就达二百亿吨！）、西藏的硼砂湖（储量达三千万吨以上！）都需要研究相图问题等等。这些问题的解决，无疑地将对社会主义建设有重大的贡献，而同时也将大大丰富祖国和世界的科学宝库。
    我认为，祖国的科学繁荣应该是科学家从实际中来又到实际中去的劳动结果，也就是说，我们不仅应该吸收世界各国的先进科学技术成就，还必须结合祖国自然资源和生产的实际，使科学在我国的土地上生根、成长、开花、结果，而西北地区正是急待开发的一块处女地。科学研究机构，特别是科学院的机构，虽不必一定都设在产地，但和产地更接近一些，和实际生活更接近一些是有裨益的，何况西北还有兰州大学等高等学校，又有地质部、石油部以及其他工业部门的研究机构可以共同协作。我建议科学院和高等教育部及有关的产业部门根据条件的许可，逐步地稳妥地在兰州建立西北科学研究中心。
