Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 12th: Xiangtan City, Hunan Province, is adopting the method of unified adjustment, taking from the fat to supplement the lean, to solve the "housing shortage" problem caused by improper allocation.

According to statistics from relevant departments, at the beginning of liberation, the total housing area in Xiangtan City, including civilian housing and the housing of bureaucratic capitalists, was more than 992,000 square meters. By 1956, the city had newly built 772,000 square meters of housing. However, there was an unreasonable phenomenon in the allocation: some units had less than two square meters per person on average, while some units had as much as 20.615 square meters per person on average; among them, the transportation company had an average of more than 36 square meters of housing per person. Some units also occupied a lot of houses that were not used or were used improperly.

In view of the above situation, Xiangtan City decided to basically stop civil construction this year. For the housing shortage problem felt by some government organs and enterprises, it was decided to adopt the method of unified adjustment and taking from the fat to supplement the lean to solve it. The specific methods are: centralize the housing management rights, with public housing and privately rented houses being managed and allocated by the housing management department in a unified manner; merge some units for living and office purposes according to the nature of their business and the situation of organizational restructuring; and re-adjust the improper use and unreasonable living conditions of housing in a reasonable manner.

Now, many government organs and enterprises have begun to voluntarily hand over surplus rooms; many people are voluntarily moving from single rooms into collective dormitories; and some units that originally planned to build new houses are no longer building them. According to statistics in early April, the city adjusted 13 buildings, solving the housing problem for 1,300 people in 11 units including the Service Bureau. The housing adjustment work is still in progress.

    统一调整　抽肥补瘦
    湘潭市解决机关企业“房荒”问题
    新华社长沙12日电　湖南省湘潭市采取统一调整、抽肥补瘦的办法，解决由于分配不当而产生的“房荒”问题。
    据有关部门的统计，解放初期湘潭市民房和官僚资产阶级的住房面积，一共有九十九万二千多平方公尺；到1956年，全市又新建住房七十七万二千平方公尺。但是在分配方面存在这样不合理的现象：有的单位平均每人不足二平方公尺，有些单位平均每人高达二○点六一五平方公尺；其中交通运输公司每人住房平均在三十六平方公尺以上。有些单位还有占据很多房屋而不用或者使用不当的现象。
    根据以上情况，湘潭市决定今年全市基本上停止民用基建。对于某些机关、企业所感到的房荒问题，决定采取统一调剂、抽肥补瘦的办法解决。具体做法是：集中房屋管理权，公房和私赁民房，统一由房屋管理部门管理调配；根据业务性质和机构改组的情况，使一些单位合并居住、合并办公；把使用不当、居住不合理的住房重新合理调整。
    现在，有许多机关、企业单位，已经开始自动交出了多余的房间；不少人自愿从单人房间搬进集体宿舍；原来一些准备新建住房的单位也不建了。据4月上旬统计，全市调整了十三栋住房，解决了服务局等十一个单位一千三百人的住房问题。现在房屋调整工作仍在继续进行。
