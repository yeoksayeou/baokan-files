    "Railway Guerrilla," is a novel with a wide readership. People love its unexpected and thrilling stories, and also its somewhat legendary heroic characters. To put such a novel on the screen would undoubtedly attract everyone's attention, and in fact, it has indeed aroused a strong response from the general audience. People who have read the novel are eager to see the movie, to see what their familiar characters and events look like on the screen.

    Some time ago, several friends and I watched this movie. We felt that the film did a good job of recreating the thrilling plots in the book. Scenes like grabbing a machine gun from a speeding train, opening a coal mine, and attacking a ticket train were all filmed well; especially the scene of attacking the ticket train. It vividly and harmoniously portrays Liu Hong's heroic courage and superb train-grabbing skills, Wang Qiang's talent and alertness, Xiao Po's calmness and optimism, and the bravery of Lu Han, Peng Liang, and others. The short shot after the battle victory is also excellent: they march on the road, singing, happily chasing, and their faces reveal an irrepressible smile, truly showing their joyous mood and optimistic spirit after winning the battle. Through all this, people can clearly see the patriotic enthusiasm of these heroic figures, their hatred for national enemies and traitors, and the invincible power generated by this. The overall tone of the film is also bright and cheerful, giving people strength.

    However, after we finished watching it, we still felt unsatisfied and unfulfilled. This dissatisfaction and unfulfillment have various reasons: some because the film did not show the close connection between the guerrillas and the masses; some because many tense scenes in the novel were deleted; and some because some plots were handled too simply, and many things were not explained clearly... But the most important thing is that we feel that the movie failed to create more vivid characters. The personalities of the main characters in the movie are not very distinct. The author arranges many interesting events one after another, but not every event is needed by the characters. Sometimes the event moves forward, but the character's personality fails to be newly revealed in the process of event development. For example, the scene of attacking the ticket train reveals the bravery, optimism, alertness, and other characteristics of the heroic figures, but in many scenes after this, such as the battle of Weishan Lake and the train collision, what we feel is still nothing more than these. In this way, it makes people feel that the image of the characters in the film is not full enough, and the film also lacks a complete and indispensable story.

    The existence of these shortcomings in the film is probably related to the method of adapting the novel into a movie. Adaptation, like creation, its object of expression is people, not events; events only need to exist when they become an indispensable plot for expressing people. Although the film retains the most exciting parts of the novel, it may not achieve a successful adaptation. "Railway Guerrilla" seems to have this shortcoming in its adaptation.

    银幕上的“飞虎队”
  　李少白
    “铁道游击队”，是一本拥有广大读者的小说。人们喜欢它那出人意料的惊险故事，也喜欢它那带点传奇色彩的英雄人物。把这样一部小说搬上银幕，无疑是会受到大家注意的，而事实上，也确是引起了广大观众的反响。读过小说的人，都急于看看电影，看看自己已经熟悉的人物和事件，在电影里到底是个什么样子。
    前些时候，我和几位朋友看了这部电影。我们觉得电影在再现书中那些惊险的情节方面，是做得好的。像飞车搞机枪、开炭厂、打票车……，都拍得不坏；特别是打票车一场，它把刘洪的英雄胆量和绝妙的扒车本领，王强的才能和机警，小坡的镇静和乐观，鲁汉、彭亮等人的勇敢，都表现得鲜明而谐和。战斗胜利后那个短短的镜头也非常出色：他们行军路上，唱歌，喜追，脸上流露出压抑不住的微笑，真正显露出了他们打了胜仗后的痛快心情和乐观的精神。透过这一切，人们清楚地看见了这些英雄人物的爱国热情，对民族敌人和叛徒的仇恨，和由此而产生的无敌的力量。影片的整个格调，也是明快、爽朗的，能给人以力量。
    但是我们看完之后，总觉得还不满足，不过瘾。这不满足，不过瘾，原因不一：有的是因为影片没有表现出游击队和群众的密切联系；有的因为小说里的许多紧张场面被删掉了；有的则因为有些情节处理得太简单，许多事情没有交代清楚……但是最主要的，我们觉得是因为电影没有创造出更为生动的人物形象的缘故。电影中的几个主要人物的性格都不大鲜明。作者一个接着一个地安排了许多有趣的事件，但是并不是每一个事件都是人物所需要的。有时事件向前发展了，而人物性格却没能在事件发展的进程中得到新的揭露。比如，打票车一场，揭示了英雄人物的勇敢、乐观、机警等等性格，而在这以后的微山湖战斗，撞车等许多场戏里，我们感受到的仍然不外乎是这些。这样，也就使人觉得影片中的人物的形象不够丰满，影片也缺乏一个完整的、不可删割的故事了。
    影片这些缺点的存在，恐怕跟如何将小说改编成为电影的方法有关。改编和创作一样，它所表现的对象是人，而不是事件；事件只有当成为表现人所不可缺少的情节时，才有必要存在。尽管电影把小说中最精彩的部分保留了，但不一定能获得改编的成功。“铁道游击队”在改编上似乎就有着这个缺点。
