    Striving for a Bumper Harvest Requires Unremitting Effort
    Liaoning Province Faces Arduous Task of Combating Drought, Planting Seeds, Preventing Pests, and Protecting Seedlings
    (Our Shenyang Dispatch, May 28th, reporter Lù Hào) The problems that have emerged in Liaoning's spring plowing production deserve attention. If these problems cannot be resolved quickly, the hope of achieving a bumper harvest this year is in danger of failing. This was stated to the reporter today by a responsible person from the Liaoning Provincial People's Committee.
    Since the beginning of this year, due to the rectification of agricultural production cooperatives and the relatively sufficient preparation of materials, the spring plowing in various parts of Liaoning has generally been timely, the sowing has been meticulous, and great achievements have been made. At present, spring plowing in the southern, eastern and western parts of the province has ended or is nearing completion. The sowing work in the northern region is expected to be completed in early June.
    After introducing the situation of spring plowing production, the responsible person emphasized: Some problems have emerged in spring plowing production, mainly because some internal contradictions of some agricultural cooperatives have not been properly resolved, the leadership of agricultural cooperatives is not democratic, and the financial system has not been made public. The production enthusiasm of farmers is not high, and many people want to engage in sideline occupations and small businesses. As a result, the attendance rate of many agricultural cooperatives is very low, and labor efficiency is not high. A large amount of land in the province this year cannot be sown in time. Some of this land belongs to fallow land, but much land should not be left uncultivated. Last year, Changtu County left 60,000 mu uncultivated. This year, it was originally planned to leave 200,000 mu uncultivated. After repeated mobilization by the three-level cadre meeting, it is estimated that about 100,000 mu of wasteland will be left uncultivated. The ten counties in the north will leave 370,000 mu uncultivated. Judging from the current situation, a large amount of land in Zhangwu and Fuxin in the west cannot be sown in time. The possibility of reduced production in these areas this year is not small.
    The responsible person continued: Because some places only emphasized the habits and needs of the masses and ignored the needs of the state, the province's economic crop and high-yield crop plans are in danger of not being completed. It is estimated that the province is still short of 100,000 mu of cotton fields. The rice planting plan in the Liaoyang area is still short of 110,000 mu. The planting area of peanuts in Yebaishou District of Jianping County only accounts for 50% of the assigned plan. Kaiyuan County planted 5,700 mu less soybeans in three townships. Judging from the current situation, the planting plans for economic crops and high-yield crops are higher than the original plans in some places; while in more places, there is a danger of failure.
    The person in charge also said that in the recent period, many areas have insufficient rainfall and strong winds, and drought has become a major threat to current spring plowing production in various places. Many places have stopped plowing and cannot sow. Only half of the 12,000 mu of cotton fields in Yingkou County have emerged. More than 30,000 mu of cotton fields in Yi County cannot emerge. In addition to drought, there are also signs of widespread pest infestation. Except for the eastern region, cutworm adults have been generally occurring in various places, and other pests such as scarabs and red spiders have also developed. Although drought and pests have attracted attention in many places, on the whole, the work of eliminating pests is still weak.
    The person in charge also said that there are only nine days left before the Grain in Ear, and there is very little time left for field sowing. If the forces on the province's agricultural front can be immediately concentrated and strengthened, it is still possible to reverse this unfavorable situation. For example, more fully and rationally use manpower and animal power; organize and request organs and troops with animal power to help and support; organize the adjustment of manpower and animal power within the scope of counties and districts, so that more economic crops and high-yield crops can be planted. If some places really cannot plant, they should quickly prepare some late-season seeds so that they can plant more late-season crops or feed. In those places that have already been planted, strengthen seedling protection and topdressing, and carry out timely weeding and cultivation to increase the yield per unit area as much as possible.
    Regarding the issue of drought resistance, the Liaoning Provincial People's Committee issued an emergency instruction to the entire province on the 25th of this month, and the responsible persons of various departments in the province are heading to the countryside separately. A drought resistance and seedling protection campaign is about to be launched throughout the province. The responsible person finally told reporters that there are many favorable conditions for striving for a bumper harvest this year. Of course, there is still a great hope for a bumper harvest. Our main struggle on the agricultural front is to do everything possible to prevent this year's bumper harvest from failing.

### 争取大丰收的步骤丝毫不能放松  辽宁省面临抗旱播种防虫保苗的艰巨斗争

    争取大丰收的步骤丝毫不能放松
    辽宁省面临抗旱播种防虫保苗的艰巨斗争
    本报沈阳28日电　记者陆灏报道：辽宁在春耕生产中所出现的一些问题很值得引起人们的注意。这些问题如果不能够迅速解决，那么争取今年大丰收的希望就有落空的危险。这是辽宁省人民委员会一位负责人今天对记者说的。
    今年以来，由于农业生产合作社进行了整顿和物资准备比较充足，辽宁各地的春耕一般还及时，播种也较细致，取得了很大成绩。目前，南部和东西部的春耕已经结束或接近结束。北部地区的播种工作预计在6月上旬也将完毕。
    这位负责人介绍了春耕生产的情况以后，着重地说：在春耕生产中出现的一些问题，主要是有些地区由于某些农业社内部矛盾没有得到妥善的解决，农业社的领导不民主和财务制度没有公开，农民的生产情绪不高，许多人想搞副业和做小买卖。结果，不少农业社的出勤率很低，劳动效率不高。全省今年有很大数量的土地不能及时播种。其中有一部分土地虽然是属于轮休地，但有很多土地是不应该荒芜的。昌图县去年撩荒六万亩，今年本来要撩荒二十万亩，经过三级干部会议一再动员，预计所撩的荒地约有十万亩。北部十个县将要撩荒三十七万亩。从目前情况来看，西部彰武、阜新等地也有大量土地不能及时播种。这些地区今年减产的可能性都是不小的。
    这位负责人继续说：因为有些地方只强调了群众的习惯和需要，忽视了国家的需要，全省经济作物和高产作物的计划有完不成的危险。估计全省棉田种植面积尚差十万亩。辽阳地区水稻播种计划还差十一万亩。建平县叶柏寿区花生的播种面积仅占下达计划的50％。开原县三个乡大豆少种了五千七百亩。从现在的情况看来，经济作物和高产作物的播种计划有的地方是原来的计划高了；而更多的地方则有落空的危险。
    负责人还说，最近一个时期许多地区降雨不足，加以强风多，各地旱象已经成为当前春耕生产的很大威胁，很多地方已经停犁，无法播种。营口县一万二千亩棉田只有一半出了苗。义县有三万多亩棉田不能出苗。除了干旱以外，虫害也有普遍发生的迹象。除了东部外，夜盗虫成虫已经在各地普遍发生，其他如金龟子、红蜘蛛等虫害也有发展。干旱和虫害虽然在很多地方已经引起了注意，但整个说来，消灭虫害的工作目前还是薄弱的。
    负责人还说，眼下离芒种还有九天，大田播种就剩下很短的时间了。如果全省农业战线上的力量能够马上集中起来，加强突击，扭转这种不利的局面还是有可能的。比如能够更充分合理地使用人力畜力；组织和请求有畜力的机关、部队帮助支援；组织县区范围内的人力畜力的调剂，这样就可以多种一些经济作物和高产作物。有些地方如果实在种不上，就应该赶快准备一些晚田种子，以便多种些晚田或饲料。在那些已经种上的地方，加强保苗追肥，及时铲趟，尽可能地提高单位面积产量。
    关于抗旱问题，辽宁省人民委员会在本月25日已经向全省发出了紧急指示，省里各部门的负责人都正分头下乡，一个抗旱保苗的运动马上就要在全省开展起来。这位负责人最后对记者说，今年争取丰收的有利条件是很多的。丰收当然还是很有希望的。我们当前在农业战线上的主要斗争就是要想尽一切办法，使今年的大丰收不要落空。
