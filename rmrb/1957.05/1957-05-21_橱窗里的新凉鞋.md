New sandals in the shop window
    Summer is coming, and the various styles of sandals in the shop windows of Beijing shoe stores are attracting pedestrians. Up to now, the designers of the Beijing Leather Company have trial-produced dozens of kinds of sandals and slippers. Because the supply of leather is insufficient this year, some leather-soled sandals have uppers made of large silk and nylon, while others are pieced together from scrap leather strips, with harmonious colors, beautiful and generous designs, and are also very strong. In particular, women comrades wearing light-colored clothes will definitely look very elegant if they pair them with a pair of half-heeled beige sandals with brown edges. (Picture attached)

    橱窗里的新凉鞋
    夏天来了，北京市皮鞋商店的橱窗里各式凉鞋吸引着行人。到现在为止，北京市皮革公司的设计师们，已经试制出几十种凉鞋和夹鞋。因为今年皮革供应不足，有些皮底凉鞋面是用大丝绸、尼龙做的，有些则用碎皮条拼成，色泽调和，美观大方，也很结实。尤其是穿浅色衣服的女同志，如果配上一对半高跟的米色地镶着褐色边的凉鞋，一定显得很潇洒。（附图片）
