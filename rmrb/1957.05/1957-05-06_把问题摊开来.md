Laying the Problem Out
　　Zhang Shihong

    We face two kinds of difficulties. One kind can be resolved through subjective effort. Leaders should address these difficulties, prioritizing them according to their importance and urgency. The other kind arises from many objective and complex reasons, making immediate resolution impossible. We must truthfully inform the masses about these difficulties, neither minimizing nor exaggerating them, explaining the genuine reasons why the difficulties cannot be overcome, and educating the masses to adopt a correct attitude towards these difficulties.

    One of the most important characteristics of bureaucratic leadership is their tendency to conceal the truth, not telling the masses the truth, exaggerating the favorable aspects of things, and hiding the unfavorable aspects. Problems that can be solved are left unresolved, while unrealistic promises are made about problems that cannot be solved. In this way, the masses cannot distinguish between the difficulties caused by bureaucracy and those caused by objective reasons. They will indiscriminately blame the leadership, creating antagonism between the leadership and the masses. Can we blame the masses for this? No, because the masses do not understand the truth.

    For example, the Guohua Coal Ball Factory is one of the largest coal ball factories in Shanghai. Last winter, the Municipal Coal Construction Company and the Tianjin Coal Construction Company negotiated and decided to move the factory to Tianjin for production. Moving the factory was, of course, feasible, but the factory's leadership did not adopt the correct method to mobilize the masses. Instead, they used boasts, saying that Tianjin's conditions were better than Shanghai's, with large workshops, canteens, family dormitories, clubs, etc. They even showed the workers a map of the Tianjin factory's area. Consequently, the workers were happy to move the factory. However, upon arriving in Tianjin, they immediately discovered that the factory buildings had not yet been built, the machines had not been installed, and everything else was an empty promise. Under these circumstances, the masses developed dissatisfaction, which affected the progress of the work. These leaders thought that concealing the truth would mobilize the masses, but in reality, they seriously alienated themselves from the masses, lost their leadership prestige, and brought endless difficulties to future work. If the leadership had not done this, but had told the workers the truth, and patiently explained the significance of moving the factory, raising the masses' ideological awareness, the masses would not have disagreed. And after arriving at the new site, if the leadership could lead the masses to overcome difficulties together, the masses would not have had so many complaints.

    One of the reasons why these leaders are unwilling to explain the truth to the masses is that they do not trust the masses. They believe that if they tell the masses the truth, the masses will waver and nothing will be accomplished. They underestimate the masses' awareness and lack confidence in their own leadership strength. Another reason is that they neglect or are unwilling to do ideological work. Indeed, telling the masses about situations unfavorable to the development of work requires patient and meticulous ideological work, which means more trouble. If they conceal the truth, "turning big problems into small problems, and small problems into no problems," it is much easier and more convenient, so they take the shortcut.

    To overcome bureaucratic leadership styles, we must first change this erroneous attitude towards the masses. Wherever the masses are truly trusted and problems are laid out to mobilize the masses to solve them together, bureaucracy will be gradually overcome, the contradictions between the leadership and the masses will be eased, the masses' sense of ownership will be strengthened, and bottom-up supervision will be realized. Some time ago, the Shanghai Joint Venture Huiming Flashlight Factory did not have enough orders and was losing money. The workers were dissatisfied with the leadership, believing that it was mainly caused by the leadership's bureaucracy. But this was not the case. The factory's main difficulty was a shortage of raw materials. However, even though the difficulty could not be resolved for the time being, the Party branch still studied the opinions of the masses. They felt that the problem should be laid out, so that the masses could correctly deal with the difficulty, and not concentrate the contradiction on the relationship between the leadership and the masses. So the Party branch secretary made a report to the workers, explaining in detail the problems existing in the factory and the real situation of raw material difficulties. The workers were very moved, knowing that the leadership also had difficulties, and changed their views on the leadership. When arranging the work for the first quarter of this year, the Party branch laid out the various indicators, from tasks, funds, profits to be turned over to the state, to wages, management fees, raw materials and other expenses, explaining the detailed accounts to the masses one by one. The calculation results showed the workers that, given the current situation, it would be difficult to complete the state's profit target. What should be done? The accounts were very clear, and the leadership could not be blamed, so everyone came to brainstorm and make rationalization proposals to the Party branch on saving raw materials. Finally, the workers came up with many ways to save raw materials from design, operation methods, etc. It is now estimated that about 15% of raw materials can be saved.

    Close contact with the masses and reliance on the masses is a principle that our Party cannot do without in any work. Since we want the people to work with us to overcome difficulties, we should lay out the problems and study them together with the masses, so that the masses can also be informed and clear-headed, and eliminate possible estrangement and misunderstandings between the Party and the masses. All the work of our Party is for the highest interests of the people of the whole country. We have no secrets to hide, and we do not need to cover up the shortcomings and mistakes in our work. Being honest, we can stand closely with the masses, overcome difficulties, and move forward together.

    把问题摊开来
  　章世鸿
    我们的面前有两种困难，一种困难是通过主观的努力可以得到解决的，对这种困难，领导上应该分别轻重缓急加以解决；另一种困难的产生有许多客观的复杂的原因，这些困难一下子是不可能解决的。对这类困难我们必须既不缩小也不夸大地告诉群众，把困难不能克服的真实原因告诉群众，并且教育群众用正确的态度去对待困难。
    官僚主义领导的重要特点之一是：他们往往掩盖问题的真相，不向群众说真话，夸大事情的有利方面，隐瞒事情的不利方面。可以解决的问题不去解决，不能解决的问题则又随便许愿。这样，群众就分不清那些困难是官僚主义造成的，那些困难是客观原因造成的，他们就会不分清红皂白把责任都推在领导身上，形成了领导和群众之间的对立。这能责怪群众吗？不能，因为群众不了解事情的真相。
    举个例子：国华煤球厂是上海最大的煤球厂之一，去年冬季，市煤建公司和天津煤建公司协商，决定把这个厂迁往天津生产。迁厂当然是可以的，但这个厂的领导上并没有采取正确的方法动员群众，而是采取吹嘘的方法，说天津条件比上海好，厂内有大车间、食堂、家属宿舍、俱乐部等，还把天津工厂的面积图拿出来给工人看。于是工人们乐于迁厂了。但到了天津，立刻发现厂房还没有盖好，机器也没有安置，其他一切的一切也都是空头支票。在这种情况下，群众产生了不满情绪，影响了工作的开展。这些领导者满以为掩盖真相就能动员群众，可是实际上却是严重地脱离了群众，丧失了领导的威信，给以后工作带来无穷困难。如果领导上不是这样做，而把真相告诉工人，同时耐心地把迁厂的意义说清楚，提高群众的思想认识，群众是不会不同意的；到了新地，领导上又能带动群众一起去克服困难，群众也就不会有更多的怨言。
    这些领导者所以不肯向群众说明真相，原因之一是他们不信任群众，他们以为向群众说了真话，群众就会动摇，于是什么事都做不成，他们对群众的自觉性估计太低，对自己的领导力量又缺乏自信；原因之二是他们忽视或不愿做思想工作。的确，把不利于工作开展的情况告诉群众，就得做耐心的细致的思想工作，麻烦也就多些；如果掩盖真相，“大事化小事，小事化无事”，这就轻松方便得多，于是他们走了捷径。
    克服官僚主义的领导方式就必须首先改变对群众的这种错误态度。凡是真正信任群众，能够把问题摊出来发动群众一起去解决的地方，官僚主义就会逐步得到克服，领导和群众间的矛盾就会得到缓和，群众的主人翁态度就会加强，自下而上的监督就会实现。上海合营汇明手电厂前些时候任务不足，亏本，工人对领导不满，他们认为这主要是领导上官僚主义造成的。但事实并不是这样，这个厂的主要困难是原料不足。可是尽管困难一时无法解决，党支部还是研究了群众意见。他们觉得应该把问题摊出来，这样才能使群众正确地对待困难，而不使矛盾集中到领导和群众的关系上。于是党支部书记向工人作了报告，详细说明厂内存在的问题，说明原料困难的真实情况。工人听了很感动，知道领导也有困难，对领导的看法有了改变。今年布置第一季度工作时，党支部又把各项指标摊出来，从任务、资金、上缴利润到工资、管理费用、原料及其他开支等，向群众一一算了细账。计算结果，工人发现，照目前情况看，完成国家上缴利润是有困难的。怎么办呢？账目很清楚，不能怪领导，于是大家就来动脑筋，向党支部提节约原料的合理化建议。最后，工人们从设计、操作方法等各方面想出很多节约原料的办法，现在估计可以节约原料15％左右。
    密切联系群众，依靠群众，是我们党进行任何工作所离不开的一条原则，我们既然要让人民群众和我们一起努力克服困难，就应该把问题摊出来同群众一起研究，使群众也能心中有数，并且清除党和群众之间可能引起的隔膜和误解。我们党的一切工作都是为了全国人民的最高利益，我们没有不可告人的秘密，我们也不必掩盖我们工作中的缺点和错误。老老实实，就能够同群众紧紧站在一起，战胜困难，共同前进。
