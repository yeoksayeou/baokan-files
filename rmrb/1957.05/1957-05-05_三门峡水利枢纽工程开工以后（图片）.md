After the Start of the Sanmenxia Water Control Project

The first project for the comprehensive management of the Yellow River - the Sanmenxia Water Control Project - officially started on April 13th.

According to the design, a concrete gravity dam with a crest length of about one kilometer and a height of one hundred and ten meters will be built at Sanmenxia. This dam will block the Yellow River, forming a reservoir with a capacity of 64.7 billion cubic meters, larger than Poyang Lake, allowing the river water to clarify and slowly discharge. At the same time, with the implementation of soil and water conservation work on the plateau, the Yellow River will become a clear, beneficial stream for the people. Furthermore, due to the regulation of the reservoir, the 790-kilometer river channel from Mangshan to the estuary can be navigated by 200-ton ships. The dam also includes a hydroelectric power station, which can generate 1.1 million kilowatts using the reservoir's high water level, with an annual power generation of 6 billion kilowatt-hours. This will be the largest power station in the country at present, guaranteeing electricity for industrial bases in Shaanxi, Shanxi, Henan, and other provinces.

With the construction of the reservoir, the once-in-a-thousand-year flood of the Yellow River can be reduced from 35,000 cubic meters per second to 6,000 cubic meters per second. This will fundamentally eliminate the threat of floods to the 80 million people living downstream of the Yellow River, and enable irrigation for 40 million mu of farmland in Hebei, Shandong, and Henan provinces.

Conquering the Yellow River is an extremely great undertaking in the history of our country, and the Sanmenxia Water Control Project is the first large-scale construction in the work of conquering the Yellow River. The dreams of the people for thousands of years are about to become a reality in our hands.

This is a panoramic view of Sanmenxia. A dam, roughly as shown in the schematic diagram, will be built here.

Cable crane towers, more than ten meters high, have already been erected and are beginning to transport bridge building materials.

Thousands of workers from all over the country are engaged in arduous excavation work on Renmen Island, which is impacted by the river water. Drillers climb on steep cliffs, operating drills, fighting against the hardest rock in Sanmenxia - diorite porphyry.

Pile drivers erected with pontoons are driving piles in the Yellow River's rapids, preparing to build bridge piers.

Surveyors from the Power Branch of the Sanmenxia Engineering Bureau are climbing the mountains to survey the power transmission lines for the power generation train from Majiahe Bottom to Sanmenxia.

The Soviet government has designated its most outstanding engineers to participate in the design of the Sanmenxia project and has sent a large number of experts to the construction site. This is Soviet geologist Sakolova at work.

An archaeological team from the Chinese Academy of Sciences has appeared on Renmen Island.

Lunch on the banks of the Yellow River has a special flavor.

After work, a wonderful performance by bulldozer operators Wang Wanxin and Qi Dongsheng - playing with "kongzhu" (Chinese yo-yo).

Large quantities of materials supporting the Sanmenxia Water Control Project are transported from all over the country to Huixing Station and then transported to the construction site by truck.

I don't know how much rock the workers have dug up and how many gullies they have filled to build a flat road more than 30 kilometers long from the new urban area of Sanmenxia to the Sanmenxia construction site.

The groundbreaking ceremony was held on April 13th on Guimen Island in the middle of the Yellow River and on the hillside on the south bank of Henan. More than 5,000 people attended the ceremony.

    三门峡水利枢纽工程开工以后
    全面治理黄河的第一个工程——三门峡水利枢纽工程已经在4月13日开工了。
    按照设计，将在三门峡修起一座坝顶长约一公里，高达一百一十公尺的混凝土重力坝，这个拦河坝把黄河拦腰堵住，形成一个水库。水库的容量将达六百四十七亿立公方，比鄱阳湖还要大，让河水在这里澄清，慢慢下泄；同时随着高原上的水土保持工作的开展，将使黄河变成一条细流碧波、为人民造福的河流。又由于水库的调节，由邙山到海口的七百九十公里内的河道，可以航行二百吨的船只。拦河坝还带有水电站，利用水库的高水位可以发电一百一十万瓩，每年发电量为六十亿度，将是目前全国最大的发电站，可以保证陕西、山西、河南等省工业基地的用电。
    由于水库的兴建，可把黄河千年一遇的洪水由三万五千秒公方减少倒六千秒公方。使威胁黄河下游八千万人民的洪水灾害根本解除，使河北、山东、河南三省四千万亩农田得到灌溉。
    征服黄河是我国历史上的一件极其伟大的事情，三门峡水利枢纽工程又是征服黄河工作中的第一个规模空前巨大的建设。人们几千年来的梦想，就要在我们手里变成现实。

    这是三门峡的全景。就要在这个地方修建一座大体上如示意图那样的拦水大坝。
    十多公尺高的缆索起重机塔架已经架设起来，开始运输建桥的器材。
    来自各地的上千的工人，正在河水冲击的人门岛上进行艰巨的开挖工作。风钻工攀登在悬崖峭壁上，开动着风钻，向三门峡最坚硬的岩石——闪长斑岩搏斗。
    用浮箱架起的打桩机，在黄河急流中进行打桩，准备架设桥墩。
    三门峡工程局动力分局线路工程队的测量人员登上山头，为马家河底至三门峡的发电列车测量输电线路。
    苏联政府指定最优秀的工程师参加三门峡工程的设计，并派了大批专家来到工地。这是苏联地质专家萨柯洛娃在工作。
    在人门岛上出现了中国科学院的一支考古队。
    黄河岸上的午餐，别有风味。 
    下工后，推土机手王万新、齐东升的精采表演——抖“空竹”。
    支援三门峡水利枢纽工程的大批物资从各地运到会兴车站后，再用汽车运送到工地。
    不知工人们挖掉了多少山石，填平了多少沟壑，才修起了一条从三门峡新市区至三门峡工地的三十余公里长的平坦的公路。
    4月13日在三门峡河中间的鬼门岛和河南岸的山坡上举行开工典礼。参加开工典礼的有五千多人。
