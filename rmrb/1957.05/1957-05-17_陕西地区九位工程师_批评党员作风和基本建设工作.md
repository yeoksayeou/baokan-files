This is a report from our correspondent in Xi'an on the 15th: On the afternoon of the 13th, the Shaanxi correspondent station of this newspaper and the editorial department of Shaanxi Daily invited nine engineers from architectural and design units in the Xi'an area for a discussion. The participants included Xu Guozhang, Deputy Dean and Chief Engineer of the Northwest Electric Power Design Branch; Xu Jiayuan, Deputy Chief Engineer; Hong Qing and Fang Shanshou, Deputy Chief Engineers of the Northwest Industrial Architecture Design Institute; Wang Qingdao, Deputy Chief Engineer of the Xi'an Coal Mine Basic Construction Bureau; Cai Dewu, Chief Engineer of the Xi'an Coal Mine Design Institute; Zhang Zhiping and Dong Qiliang, Engineers of the Northwest Engineering Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Construction Engineering; and Hong Zhiming, Engineer of the Northwest Textile Administration Bureau. The engineers focused on criticizing and offering opinions on the relationship between Party and non-Party members and the problems existing in basic construction.

    Wang Qingdao said:
    Technical Personnel Have the Title But No Authority
    Wang Qingdao said: In the coal mine system, the administrative and technical leadership of each enterprise are separate. In reality, it is difficult to clearly delineate administrative and technical leadership. For example, technical personnel at each construction site are responsible for reviewing drawings, etc. If this work does not receive administrative support, it is difficult to implement. As a result, many units have formed the understanding that administrative leadership is "solid line leadership," where orders can be implemented, while technical leadership is "dotted line leadership," where implementation is optional. Over time, this has led to a decline in the enthusiasm of technical personnel. He said that when leaders use and transfer technical personnel, they rarely consult with those responsible for technical leadership work beforehand. This makes technical personnel feel that "the leaders decide everything," and they gradually develop a guest mentality. Zhang Zhiping said that there is a section in the Northwest Engineering Administration Bureau with a total of three people. The section chief is an engineer with many years of experience. The deputy section chief is a Communist Party member. The deputy section chief does not respect the section chief's decisions, and rarely consults with the section chief when arranging his own work. As a result, they each do their own thing.
    Many people mentioned that there is factionalism within the Party. Some major issues are not discussed with technical personnel, some data and documents are unnecessarily "classified" to technical personnel, and some meetings that non-Party comrades could attend are not open to them. This has caused considerable losses in work.
    Fang Shanshou said:
    The Party Only Pays Attention to Training Young People and Neglects Senior Intellectuals
    Fang Shanshou also mentioned that in recent years, the Northwest Industrial Architecture Design Institute has developed Party members by absorbing young technical personnel and some who are obsequious. They have trained young people but neglected senior intellectuals. He said that Party member leaders rarely solicit the opinions of senior intellectuals during normal times. Often, when a movement comes, they ask a few questions, but when the movement ends, the issues raised are not followed up. Some people say that the relationship between the Party and non-Party members is a two-way problem. I believe that if the Party does not follow up after senior intellectuals have spoken, then the poor relationship between the Party and non-Party members is a one-way problem. Cai Dewu said that the Party also has factionalism in its cadre policy. Many people say that if you are not a Party member, you can forget about being a leader, and this is actually the case. This is not to say that we oppose Party members being leaders, but it is too biased.
    Cai Dewu said:
    Some Old Party Members Are Not as Hardworking as Non-Party Members
    Many engineers believe that the factionalism of Party members towards non-Party members is also reflected in their lives. Cai Dewu said: Party members and non-Party members at the Xi'an Coal Mine Design Institute cannot integrate. Whether it is eating, watching movies, or playing cards, Party members are always with Party members, and non-Party members are always with non-Party members. The Party organization usually does not show enough concern for the political improvement of non-Party members. Therefore, many technical personnel report that they do not feel the warmth of the Party.
    Cai Dewu also said: Old cadres have contributed to the revolution. Many people have become ill or even disabled in the arduous revolutionary struggle. They are politically reliable, have a relatively high level of theory, and can play a leading role in their work. However, in the past two years, some old cadres have changed their thinking. They eat and dress better than ordinary people. Some leaders call loudly when urging people to buy public bonds, but they have a lot of income themselves, have a lot of money in the bank, but buy very few public bonds. Fang Shanshou said that in recent years, the political level of some Party members has not improved much. For example, when the Northwest Industrial Architecture Design Institute wanted to adjust housing, everyone agreed to the principle of "unified allocation," but some Party members actually grabbed houses, posting notices outside the houses, and some even jumped in through the windows to occupy houses. Some Party members applied for subsidies while registering to buy bicycles.
    Some people pointed out that due to the serious bureaucratism and factionalism of some Party member cadres, they have become detached from the masses, thereby reducing the Party's prestige. Fang Shanshou said: I have received a lot of training and help from the Party. I have thought about the issue of joining the Party for a long time. Now I can still talk to some technical personnel, but after joining the Party, will I still be able to speak to technical personnel? Will it still be easy to work? Therefore, I am still hesitant about whether or not to apply to join the Party.
    Xu Guozhang said that some Party member leading cadres at the Northwest Electric Power Design Institute do not understand the business and are not actively learning. Some people emphasized that they were outsiders when they first transferred to the job, but now it has been five or six years, and they are still emphasizing that they are outsiders. Our organization once organized a technical class, which I taught. Initially, more than 30 cadres came to listen, but some people stopped coming after one or two sessions, and later there were only four or five people left, and it slowly collapsed. These comrades are unwilling to learn technology, seemingly believing that engaging in political work and talking about great principles can still get them by. But in reality, some people have not done political work well. For example, the director of a design office does not usually get close to production personnel. Sometimes, he calls people in by name for half an hour, thinking that he has solved ideological problems. But ideological problems are mainly manifested in production. How can you do a good job in ideological work if you are divorced from production?
    Hong Qing and others said:
    National Construction Guidelines and Technical Policies Change Frequently
    Technical Personnel Are Uncertain and Can't Help But Watch the Trends
    Cai Dewu said: The leadership often wavers on major technical policies, making it impossible for subordinates to figure out what to do. For example, the issue of increasing production and practicing economy was only mentioned generally in 1955. The leading departments did not clearly specify what should be saved and what should not be saved. As a result, things that should not have been saved were also saved. In 1956, a meeting was held in the Ministry of Coal Industry to study technical directions, which was actually just a translation of the Soviet technical directions. The higher-ups copied dogmatically, and the lower-ups implemented dogmatically. This year, the issue of increasing production and practicing economy has been raised again. It has changed every year for the past three years. Some technical personnel are now saying, "Let's not move for now and see what the trend is." Hong Qing said that many problems in design are caused by the frequent changes in national policy. In 1954, a meeting of the Architectural Society emphasized national forms. In 1955, Comrade Li Fuchun raised the issue of lowering construction standards. At that time, many people did not clearly understand this issue and turned lowering standards into lowering quality. This year, it was proposed that construction standards were too high in the past and that our country's economic conditions do not allow it, so we should be simpler. This is now clear.
    Chief Engineer Xu Guozhang said that some leading personnel have the idea of blindly believing in foreign countries. He said: In the past, regardless of whether our country could produce them, machine equipment was imported as complete sets. This caused a lot of waste and was detrimental to the development of our country's machinery industry. The reason for this phenomenon is, objectively, due to our lack of experience. Subjectively, it is because we have not fully utilized the wisdom of the vast number of technical personnel. Complete sets of imported equipment are mostly contracts signed by assistant ministers and bureau directors with a few technical personnel abroad. Some comrades are willing to use complete sets of foreign equipment because it saves trouble. If there is a problem in the future, they can blame it on foreign countries. In addition, they think that foreign things are all good.

    陕西地区九位工程师
    批评党员作风和基本建设工作
    本报西安15日电　13日下午，本报驻陕西记者站和陕西日报编辑部，邀请西安地区建筑和设计单位的九位工程师座谈。参加这次座谈会的有西北电力设计分院副院长兼总工程师徐国璋、副总工程师徐嘉元，西北工业建筑设计院副总工程师洪青、方山寿，西安煤矿基本建设局副总工程师王清道，西安煤矿设计院总工程师蔡德五，建筑工程部西北工程管理局工程师张志平、董其良，西北纺织管理局工程师洪稚明。工程师们着重对党与非党人士的关系和基本建设方面存在的问题提出了批评和意见。
    王清道说：
    技术人员有职无权
    王清道说：煤矿系统各企业的行政领导和技术领导是分开的，实际上，行政领导和技术领导很难划分清楚。例如各施工现场的技术人员负责审查图纸等工作，这些工作如果得不到行政的支持，就很难贯彻。不少单位因此形成行政领导是“实线领导”，下命令就可以实行；技术领导是“虚线领导”，下面可实行也可以不实行。长时间如此，就使技术人员的积极性衰退。他说：领导上对技术人员的使用和调动，事先很少同负责技术领导工作的人商量。使技术人员感到是“领导决定一切”，慢慢就形成作客思想。张志平说：西北工程管理总局有一个科，共有三个人，科长是个工程师，作科长工作已经多年，很有经验；副科长是个共产党员。科长的决定副科长不尊重，副科长自己布置工作又很少同科长商量，结果形成各干各的。
    许多人都谈到党内有宗派主义情绪，有些重大问题不同技术人员商量，有些资料、文件不必要地对技术人员“保密”，有些可以让非党同志参加的会议没有让他们参加。这给工作带来不少损失。
    方山寿说：
    党只注意培养青年疏忽了高级知识分子
    方山寿还谈到，几年来西北工业建筑设计院发展党员，吸收的都是些年青的技术人员和一些唯唯诺诺的人；对青年人培养了，对高级知识分子疏忽了。他说：党员领导同志平时很少征求高级知识分子的意见，往往在一个运动来了，问上几句，运动结束了，提出的问题也就没有下文了。有人说党和非党人士的关系是双方面的问题，我认为，在高级知识分子讲了话没有下文的情况下，党与非党关系搞不好，就是单方面的问题了。蔡德五说：党在干部政策上也有宗派主义情绪。不少人说，你如果不是党员就甭想作领导工作，实际上也是如此。这倒不是说反对党员作领导工作，只是太偏了些。
    蔡德五说：
    有些老党员还不如党外人员艰苦
    许多工程师认为，党员对待党外人士的宗派主义也表现在生活上。蔡德五说：西安煤矿设计院的党员和非党人士不能打成一片，就是吃饭，看电影，打扑克，也都是党员和党员在一起，非党人士和非党人士在一起，党组织平常对非党人士从政治上如何提高关怀不够。因此，不少技术人员反映感不到党的温暖。
    蔡德五还说：老干部对革命有功劳，很多人在艰苦的革命斗争中把身体搞得有了病甚至残废，政治上可靠，理论水平比较高，工作中能起带头作用。可是近两年来，有些老干部思想上发生了变化，穿的吃的，比一般人还要好些。有些领导人员在号召买公债时叫得很响，但是自己收入不少，银行里存着很多钱，买的公债却很少。方山寿说：这几年，有些党员的政治水平没有多大提高。如西北工业建筑设计院要调整房子，大家都同意“统一分配”的原则，但是有些党员竟抢房子，自己在房子外边贴上条子，还有人从窗子跳进去占房子。也有的党员一边去申请补助，一边去登记购买脚踏车。
    有些人指出，由于一些党员干部存在着严重的官僚主义和宗派主义，脱离了群众，因而降低了党的威信。方山寿说：我受党的培养和帮助不少。关于入党问题我考虑了很久。现在我还可以和一些技术人员在一起谈谈心，入党以后，同技术人员说话是否还能说得进去？工作还好不好作？因此，申请不申请入党，我还很犹豫。
    徐国璋说：西北电力设计院有些党员领导干部不懂业务也不积极学习。有些人刚转业来时强调自己外行，现在已经五、六年了，还是强调外行。我们机关曾经组织过技术课，由我来讲授。开始有三十多个干部来听，有的人听一两次就不来听了，后来只剩下四、五个人，慢慢就垮了。这些同志不愿意学技术，似乎以为搞政治工作，讲讲大道理照样吃的开。但是，实际上有些人政治工作也没有作好。如有一个设计室的主任平常不同生产人员接近，有时候用点名的办法把人叫去谈上半个钟头话，就以为解决思想问题了。但是思想问题主要表现在生产上，如果脱离生产怎么能搞好思想工作呢？
    洪青等人说：
    国家建设方针和技术政策多变
    技术人员捉摸不定，不能不多看看风头
    蔡德五说：重大的技术政策，领导上经常摇摆不定，让下边无法捉摸。如增产节约问题，1955年只是一般地提了一下，领导部门没有明确提出哪些应该节约，哪些不应该节约，结果把不该节约的也节约了。1956年在煤炭工业部开会研究技术方向，实际上就是把苏联的技术方向翻译了一下发下来。上边教条主义地搬，下边就教条主义地执行。今年又提出增产节约，这三年里每年一变。目前有些技术人员就说，现在先不要动，看看风头再说。洪青说：设计中很多问题是国家的方针多变造成的。1954年建筑学会开会强调民族形式，1955年李富春同志提出降低建筑标准问题，那时候许多人对这个问题认识不明确，把降低标准搞成降低质量。今年才提出，过去建设标准高了，我们国家经济条件不允许，要简陋一点。这样就清楚了。
    徐国璋总工程师说某些领导人员存在着迷信外国的思想。他说：过去不管我们国家能否生产，机器设备都成套进口，这便造成许多浪费，对于我国机械工业的发展也不利。造成这种现象的原因，客观上是由于我们的经验不足；从主观方面看，是没有充分发挥广大技术人员的智慧，成套进口的设备，多是部长助理、局长带少数几个技术人员到国外去签定的合同。某些同志愿意用全套的国外设备，是因为图省事，将来出了问题就往国外一推；另外就是认为外国的都是好的。
