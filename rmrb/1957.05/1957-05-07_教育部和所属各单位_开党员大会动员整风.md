The Ministry of Education and Affiliated Units
Hold Party Member Congress to Mobilize for Rectification

(Our Newspaper) On May 6th, the CCP Ministry of Education Party Group convened a general meeting of all Party members from the Ministry of Education and affiliated units, including the People's Education Publishing House, the preparatory office of the People's Education Science Research Institute, the Teachers' Daily, and the People's Education Society, to mobilize for the rectification campaign.

At the meeting, Chen Zenggu, Deputy Secretary of the Party Group, delivered a mobilization report. Regarding the rectification within the Ministry of Education, he put forward three requirements: First, to correctly understand the contradictions among the people and to understand the principles for correctly handling contradictions among the people. Second, on the basis of understanding the issue of contradictions among the people and raising ideological awareness, to summarize the work of the Ministry of Education, analyze and study the main problems reflected in the educational cause by the contradictions among the people, and find the correct ways and steps to solve these problems. Third, to examine the ideological work style of leading cadres and overcome bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism.

Regarding the leadership of this rectification, he put forward five measures: First, to ensure that rectification and work do not interfere with each other, to prevent closed-door rectification, and to prevent the daily work from squeezing out rectification. Each unit should properly arrange administrative work according to the specific situation, prioritizing urgency and importance, and postponing work that can be delayed. It is necessary to ensure that rectification time (three and a half days per week) is not occupied. The work of the organ Party committee should focus on rectification. Second, the quality of study and rectification by leading cadres is the key to determining the quality of the entire rectification, and it must be ensured that leading cadres study well. Third, to establish rectification leading groups. The ministry's leading group has already been established, and all units must establish leading groups headed by responsible comrades. An rectification office will also be established within the ministry to collect information on the ideological situation of Party members during the rectification process and compile rectification bulletins to promote the development of the movement. Fourth, to fully promote democracy, in addition to launching free debate within the ministry, we should also ask teachers and other relevant people outside the ministry to give us critical opinions, and we should also actively convene some symposiums to solicit opinions. Fifth, during the rectification period, the branch should be an assistant to the leading group, supervising Party members (especially supervising leading cadres) to participate well in the rectification, supervising that rectification and work do not interfere with each other, and understanding and studying the ideological situation of Party members.

    教育部和所属各单位
    开党员大会动员整风
    本报讯　5月6日，中共教育部党组召开教育部和所属的人民教育出版社、人民教育科学研究所筹备处、教师报、人民教育社等单位的全体党员大会，动员整风。
    会上，党组副书记陈曾固作动员报告。对教育部整风，他提出三点要求：第一，要求正确理解人民内部矛盾和认识正确处理人民内部矛盾的原则。第二，在弄懂人民内部矛盾问题、提高了思想认识的基础上，来总结教育部的工作，分析和研究人民内部矛盾在教育事业中反映出来的主要问题，并找出正确解决这些问题的途径和步骤。第三，检查领导干部的思想作风，克服官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义。
    对这次整风的领导，他提出五点措施：第一，保证整风与工作两不误，防止关门整风，也要防止因日常工作把整风挤掉。各单位根据具体情况，分别缓急轻重，妥善安排行政工作，凡是可以缓办的工作，即留待以后再办。要保证整风时间（每周三个半天）不被占用。机关党委工作，则应以整风为中心。第二，领导干部整风学习的好坏是决定全部整风好坏的关键，必须保证领导干部学好。第三，建立整风领导小组。部的领导小组已经建立，各单位都必须建立以负责同志为首的领导小组。部内并建立整风办公室，搜集整风中党员的思想情况，编出整风简报，以推动运动的开展。第四，要充分发扬民主，除在部内展开自由辩论以外，在部外并请教师等有关方面人士给我们提批评意见，我们也应该主动地召开一些征求意见的座谈会。第五，在整风期间，支部要做领导小组的助手，监督党员（特别是监督领导干部）很好地参加整风，监督整风和工作两不误，了解和研究党员的思想情况。
