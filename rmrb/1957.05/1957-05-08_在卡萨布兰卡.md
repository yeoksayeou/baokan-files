    In Casablanca
    Liao Xunzhen
    In mid-March, we left our motherland for Morocco in North Africa to participate in the upcoming 12th Casablanca International Fair.

    The Giant Port on the Atlantic Coast
    Casablanca, or Casa for short, is a huge commercial port on the east coast of the Atlantic. The port facilities are very modern and can accommodate forty ships at the same time. Ships of 20,000 tons can dock at any time. The national railways and highways lead directly to the port, making transportation extremely convenient. Therefore, Casablanca has not only become Morocco's economic center and main gateway, but also a transportation hub connecting Africa with Europe and North and South America.

    About five hundred years ago, this was the old city of Anfa. In 1468, the city was destroyed after a Portuguese expedition. In 1575, it was occupied by the Portuguese again, and named Casa Branca. After the Portuguese withdrew in 1755, it was renamed Dar al-Beida, which means "white house" in Arabic. At the end of the eighteenth century, the Spanish obtained special trading rights in the port and named it Casablanca. After Sultan Moulay opened it as a port for trade with Europe in 1830, it gradually prospered. On July 30, 1907, France sent troops to occupy the port under the pretext of suppressing riots. It was not until Morocco gained independence last year that this place returned to the hands of the Moroccan people.

    The population of Casablanca was only 25,000 in 1907. After France occupied the port, a large number of Europeans immigrated, and the population increased dramatically. By 1936, the population had increased to 257,000. Now, the city has a population of more than 700,000, including 470,000 Arabs, 80,000 Jews, and 159,000 Europeans (99,000 of whom are French). They believe in different religions: Islam, Judaism, Christianity, and Catholicism.

    Casablanca has two cities, a new and an old one. The new city was built after a large number of Europeans immigrated. It is full of high-rise buildings, asphalt roads, and modern architecture. Most of the people living in this area are Europeans. The old city is a gathering place for Arabs and Jews. It was originally surrounded by a large wall, but it is now dilapidated. The city is full of narrow streets, and the houses are very small, forming a sharp contrast with the architecture of the European district.

    Due to the continuous growth of the Arab population, the Arab quarter of the old city can no longer accommodate it. However, the area is surrounded by the European district, so a new district had to be built near the Sultan's Palace in the suburbs. The new district has wide roads, and the buildings are all in the Arabic national style, with castles and mosques, markets and cinemas, and also middle schools. Currently, construction work is underway. We stayed there for a short time, but we have already seen a thriving scene.

    Casablanca is also a good tourist area. Its climate is pleasant, with a minimum of six degrees Celsius in winter, averaging thirteen to fourteen degrees; and a maximum of thirty-five degrees Celsius in summer, averaging twenty-two to twenty-four degrees. Therefore, the pearl-like beaches and natural swimming pools can welcome tourists from all countries throughout the year. Especially in winter, many tourists come here to escape the cold.

    This Year's International Fair
    The Casablanca International Fair was established in 1936. It was initially an agricultural exhibition and later gradually developed into an annual trade fair. It joined the International Fairs Union in 1953.

    In recent years, the fair has developed rapidly and now has 170,000 square meters of space, of which 30,000 square meters are covered with permanent buildings. The number of countries participating in the fair is also increasing. In 1955, in addition to Moroccan and French manufacturers, only five countries made comprehensive exhibitions in an official capacity. In 1956, eight countries participated in the exhibition. This year, the number of countries participating in the exhibition has increased to twenty-five; among the new participating countries are Tunisia and Syria, two Arab countries.

    This year's international fair has a rich and colorful program of events. During the fair, each day is designated as a national day for one of the participating countries. On this day, the organizers mobilize and organize the public to visit the exhibition hall of that country. The fair's daily newspaper introduces the situation of that country, and the fair's radio broadcasts the music of that country. Through this day's activities, people can have a general understanding of that country. Any country whose national day it is can use various methods for publicity, some holding film receptions, some holding fashion shows, and others holding concerts or car races, and so on.

    Morocco's activities at the fair will be more numerous and larger in scale than in any previous year. They plan to hold several "national days" during the fair, which are national movements. Currently planned are: "Literacy Day," "Children's Day," "Beautiful Baby Contest," "Aid to Schools Day," "Elimination of Tuberculosis and Blood Transfusion Day," and "Women's Beauty Festival."

    The Anticipated Chinese Exhibition Hall
    This is the second time that our country has participated in the Casablanca International Fair. Last year, the China Tea Export Company commissioned an agency company to build a "Chinese Tea Pavilion" at the fair, providing free tea to the audience, which was warmly welcomed by the Moroccan people; however, Chinese representatives were unable to enter the country because the French authorities refused to issue visas. It is said that when the Sultan of Morocco came to visit the "Chinese Tea Pavilion," he strangely asked why he had not seen representatives of the China Tea Company. The agency company explained the reason to him. The Sultan then specially sent a representative to raise the issue with the French authorities. Later, the French authorities agreed to issue visas, but it was already too late. This year, the International Fair once again invited China to participate, and the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade accepted the invitation, representing our country's foreign trade companies in making a comprehensive exhibition. Now, the exhibition hall with Chinese national characteristics has been built, and various exhibits weighing about 130 tons have been shipped here on April 15.

    Although the opening day of the fair has not yet arrived, the Chinese Exhibition Hall has become the center of people's concern and discussion. Mr. Daton, the chairman of the fair, said: "I will organize the Moroccan people to come to the Chinese Pavilion to learn on the Chinese Pavilion Day. I believe that the Chinese Exhibition Hall will be an important lesson for the Moroccan people." Local newspapers also continuously publish articles introducing China and reports on the preparation of the Chinese Exhibition Hall. The fair's daily newspaper also introduced the Chinese Pavilion under the title "China - A Symbol of Progress."

    After we arrived in Casablanca, we felt the friendship of the Moroccan people towards China everywhere. Whenever we went, many people would surround us and talk to us cordially. Some people would even say "China" according to the Chinese pronunciation, and then give a thumbs up to mean "very good." When we entered and exited the port to unload the exhibits, the Moroccan police would smile and salute us as soon as they heard that we were "staff members of the Chinese Exhibition Group."

    There are not many overseas Chinese here. The appearance of the Chinese Exhibition Hall at the fair has made these overseas Chinese who are far away from their motherland feel extremely excited. A Chinese woman, He Ying, who has been away from her motherland for more than ten years, said: "Last year, I heard that China was participating in the fair, and no matter how much money it cost, I would buy a ticket to go in and see people from the motherland. But I was very disappointed that the people selling tea in the Chinese Tea Pavilion were foreigners. Today, I have finally waited for you. When the exhibition hall opens, I want to look at the more than three thousand exhibits one by one."

    在卡萨布兰卡
    廖训振
    3月中旬，我们离开了祖国，到北非摩洛哥去，参加即将举行的第十二届卡萨布兰卡国际博览会。
    大西洋岸上的巨港
    卡萨布兰卡简称卡萨，是大西洋东岸一个巨大的商港。港口设备非常现代化，可以同时容纳四十条轮船，二万吨的大船可随时靠码头。全国铁路公路都可直达港口，交通运输极为方便。因此，卡萨布兰卡不但成为摩洛哥的经济中心和主要门户，而且是连接非洲和欧洲、南北美洲的一个交通枢纽。
    在大约五百年以前，这里原是安发旧城。1468年，在葡萄牙人的一次远征之后，这个城市被破坏了。1575年，它又被葡萄牙人占领，起名卡萨·布朗卡。1755年葡萄牙人撤退后，它又改名达勒·贝达，在阿拉伯文中是“白屋”的意思。十八世纪末叶，西班牙人得到了港口贸易的特权，把它命名为卡萨布兰卡。在1830年，苏丹穆莱把它辟为同欧洲贸易的港口后，它才逐渐繁荣起来。1907年7月30日，法国借口镇压骚乱，派兵占领了港口。直到去年摩洛哥得到独立以后，这个地方又回到了摩洛哥人民的手里。
    卡萨布兰卡的人口，在1907年时不过二万五千人。在法国占领了港口以后，欧洲人大量移居，人口才激剧增加。到1936年，人口增加到二十五万七千人。现在，这个城市的居民已经达到七十多万人；其中阿拉伯人四十七万，犹太人八万，欧洲人十五万九千（法国人占九万九千）。他们信仰着不同的宗教：伊斯兰教、犹太教、基督教和天主教。
    卡萨布兰卡有新旧两个城。新城是欧洲人大量移居以后建造起来的，里面全是高楼大厦，柏油马路，现代化的建筑。在这个区里居住的，绝大部分是欧洲人。旧城是阿拉伯人和犹太人的聚居地，四周原来有一座很大的围墙，但现在已破旧不堪。城内布满着狭窄的街道，房子都很矮小，和欧洲区的建筑形成尖锐的对比。
    由于阿拉伯人口的不断增长，旧城的阿拉伯区已经不能再容纳了。但是这个区域的四周已被欧洲区所包围，于是只得在城郊苏丹宫的附近建立一个新区。新区马路宽敞，建筑都是阿拉伯民族形式的，有城堡和清真寺，有市场和电影院，也有中学校。目前，兴建工作正在进行着。我们在那里停留时间很短，但是已经看到了一种欣欣向荣的景象。
    卡萨布兰卡还是一个很好的游览地区。它的气候适人，冬天最低摄氏六度，平均十三度到十四度；夏天最高三十五度，平均二十二度到二十四度。因此，珠沙般的海滩，天然的游泳池，一年四季都可以接待各国的游客。特别是冬天，到这里来避寒的游客特别多。
    今年的国际博览会
    卡萨布兰卡国际博览会建立在1936年，最初只是一个农业展览会，后来才逐渐发展成为每年举行一次的贸易博览会。从1953年起，它加入了国际博览会联盟。
    几年来，博览会发展很快，现在已经拥有十七万平方米的场地，其中有三万平方米盖上了永久性的建筑。参加博览会的国家也越来越多。1955年，除了摩洛哥和法国的厂商外，只有五个国家以官方名义作综合性展出。1956年，有八个国家参加了展出。今年，参加展出的国家已经增加到二十五个了；在新参加博览会的国家中，包括突尼斯和叙利亚这两个阿拉伯国家。
    今年的国际博览会的活动是丰富多采的。它在博览会期间，每天举行一个国家的馆日。在这一天里，大会动员和组织群众到这个国家的展览馆去参观，大会日报介绍这个国家的情况，大会广播放送这个国家的音乐。通过这一天的活动，人们可以对这一个国家有一个概括的了解，凡是轮到那个国家的馆日都可以采用各种各样的方式进行宣传，有的举行电影招待会，有的举行服装表演，也有举行音乐会或汽车比赛等等。
    摩洛哥在博览会的活动将比过去任何一年都要多，而且都是大规模的。它们准备在博览会期间举行几个“国家日”，即全国性的运动。现在计划中的有：“扫除文盲日”、“儿童日”、“美丽婴儿比赛会”、“援助学校日”、“消灭肺病及输血日”以及“妇女美丽节日”。
    期待中的中国展览馆
    我国是第二次参加卡萨布兰卡国际博览会了。去年，中国茶业出口公司委托一家代理公司在博览会上建了一个“中国茶亭”，免费供给观众饮茶，受到摩洛哥人民热烈欢迎；但是，中国代表却因为法国当局拒绝发给签证而不能入境。据说，摩洛哥苏丹到“中国茶亭”来参观时，就奇怪地询问为什么没有看到中国茶业公司的代表。代理公司向他说明了原因。苏丹就特地派代表向法国当局提出意见。后来法国当局同意发签证，但时间已经太晚了。今年，国际博览会再度邀请中国参加，中国国际贸易促进委员会接受了这个邀请，代表我国各对外贸易公司作综合性的展出。现在，具有中国民族形式的展览馆已经建立起来了，重约一百三十吨的各种展品也已经在4月15日运到了这里。
    虽然博览会开幕的日子还没有到，但是，中国展览馆已经成为人们关心和谈论的中心。博览会主席达顿先生说：“我将在中国馆日那天组织摩洛哥人民到中国馆来学习。我相信，中国展览馆对摩洛哥人民将是重要的一课。”当地各个报纸上也不断刊登介绍中国的文章和中国展览馆筹备情况的报道。博览会日报还以“中国——进步的象征”为题介绍了中国馆。
    我们到卡萨布兰卡以后，处处感到摩洛哥人民对中国的友谊。我们每到一个地方，总有许多人围上来和我们亲切地交谈。有的人还按照汉语发音说一声“中国”，然后伸出大拇指表示“顶好”的意思。当我们进出港口卸展品时，摩洛哥的警察一听说我们是“中国展览团的工作人员”，就向我们微笑敬礼。
    在这里的华侨不多。中国展览馆在博览会上出现，使这些远离祖国的侨胞感到无比兴奋。一位离开祖国已十多年的华侨妇女何英说：“去年博览会听说有中国参加，不管花多少钱我都要买张票进去看一下从祖国来的人。可是使我很失望，在中国茶亭里卖茶叶的是外国人。今天，可把你们盼来了，等展览馆开幕时，我要把三千多种展品一件件的仔细看一看。”
