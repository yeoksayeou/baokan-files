According to the *Dazhong Daily* report: In the Jining Special District of Shandong Province, agricultural production cooperatives' summer grain pre-distribution work has been fully launched based on the basic completion of pilot work. The majority of district and township leaders are treating doing a good job of summer grain pre-distribution as the central link in resolving current rural contradictions. Hongqi Agricultural Cooperative of Xuekou Township, Jining County, specifically calculated three accounts in the process of formulating the pre-distribution plan (namely, the account of national support and industrial aid to agriculture, the account of year-by-year increase in cooperative output, and the account of improving living standards on the basis of increased production), which effectively improved the ideological understanding of cadres and cooperative members and eliminated concerns. When determining the deduction ratio, it was unanimously agreed that the cooperative's internal deduction (including agricultural tax) should account for 35% of the total income, and the members' distribution should account for 65%. Last year, the cooperative sold 500,000 jin of wheat, and this year it is decided to sell 550,000 jin.

Many agricultural cooperatives, in formulating pre-distribution plans, emphasized the working method of the mass line, fully promoted democracy, and jointly consulted with members to solve difficult problems. Some cooperative members, originally in low spirits or clamoring to withdraw from the cooperative due to the undemocratic style of the cooperative cadres, found that the cooperative leadership fully promoted democracy in the process of formulating this pre-distribution plan, allowing everyone to understand the actual situation of the cooperative. As a result, those who wanted to withdraw did not withdraw, and those who were in low spirits became active.

According to the *New Hunan Daily* report: The CCP Qianyang Prefectural Committee of Hunan Province has decided to concentrate its efforts on doing a good job of summer harvest pre-distribution work in agricultural cooperatives. Because this year's summer harvest crop area is large, accounting for a large proportion of the total annual agricultural income, coupled with sideline income, summer harvest pre-distribution has become an important task for agricultural cooperatives throughout the region, and the vast number of members are very concerned.

The Prefectural Committee analyzed the current rural situation and believed that summer harvest pre-distribution work relatively concentratedly reflects the current internal contradictions among the people in rural areas, which must be correctly resolved; otherwise, it will affect production and the consolidation of agricultural cooperatives. Therefore, it requires local party committees to concentrate their efforts on doing this work well. The main ideological obstacle to implementing the principle of distribution according to work comes from township and cooperative cadres. Some township cadres' average monthly wages plus their family income are much higher than those of ordinary members, but they are overspending households. When distributing, they use the excuse of solving the problems of "households in difficulty," unwilling to distribute according to work, and one-sidedly emphasizing taking care of them. The situation is similar with cooperative cadres. The vast number of members are extremely dissatisfied with this situation. The Prefectural Committee believes that, first of all, it is necessary to reverse this erroneous thinking of the cadres, adhere to the principle of distribution according to work, and solve the problems of individual households in difficulty from the public welfare fund and social relief funds. As for how much members should be distributed, how much should be retained within the cooperative, and how much should be sold to the state, and how to coordinate and unify the opinions between teams, it is necessary to use the form of a members' representative meeting to mobilize members to fully discuss before making a decision.

### 解决当前农村矛盾的重要一环  切实作好麦季预分工作

    解决当前农村矛盾的重要一环
    切实作好麦季预分工作
    据大众日报讯　山东省济宁专区各县农业生产合作社麦季预分工作，已在试点工作基本结束的基础上全面展开。多数区、乡领导都把搞好麦季预分工作，做为解决当前农村矛盾的中心环节来掌握。济宁县薛口乡红旗农业社在制订预分方案的过程中，具体算了三笔账（即国家扶持和工业支援农业的账、合作社产量逐年提高的账、在增产基础上改善生活的账），有效地提高了干部和社员群众的思想认识，消除了顾虑。在确定扣分比例时，一致同意社内扣除（包括农业税）占总收入的35％，社员分配占65％。去年全社出售五十万斤小麦，今年决定出售五十五万斤。
    许多农业社在制订预分方案中，强调了群众路线的工作方法，充分发扬民主，与社员共同协商解决疑难问题。有些社的社员，原先因社干部作风不民主，情绪不高或闹着要退社，在这次制订预分方案过程中，因社领导上充分发扬民主，使大家都了解到社内的实底，结果要退社的不退了，情绪不高的也积极起来了。
    据新湖南日报讯　中共湖南黔阳地委决定集中力量作好农业社的夏收预分工作。由于今年夏收作物面积大，占全年农业总收入的比重大，再加上副业收入，夏收预分便成为全区农业社的一项重要工作，广大社员都非常关心。
    地委分析了当前农村情况，认为夏收预分工作，比较集中地反映了当前农村人民内部矛盾，必须正确解决，否则就会影响生产，影响农业社的巩固。因此，要求各地党委集中力量做好这一工作。当前贯彻按劳取酬原则的主要思想障碍，来自乡社干部。有的乡干部每月的平均工资加家里的收入比一般社员高得很多，却是超支户。分配的时候，他们便借口解决“困难户”的问题，不愿按劳取酬，片面强调照顾。社干部也有类似情况。广大社员对这种情况极不满意。地委认为：首先要扭转干部这种错误思想，坚持按劳取酬原则，对个别困难户可以从公益金和社会救济款中加以解决。至于社员分多少，社内留多少，向国家出售多少，队与队之间的意见如何协调统一，要利用社员代表大会的形式，发动社员充分讨论之后，再作出决议。
