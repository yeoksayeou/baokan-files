Xinhua News Agency, May 5th: The Ministry of Health has invited experts and professors from various medical science research institutions, higher medical colleges, and major hospitals in Beijing for the past two days to hold symposiums to listen to their opinions on how to implement the "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" policy in health work.

In their speeches, the experts and professors emphatically pointed out a fundamental shortcoming in China's health work, which is that the direction of "prevention first" has been neglected. Public health expert Jin Baoshan said: From cities to villages, medical undertakings have developed greatly, but preventive work has developed very little. The entire medical education is also like this. The Director of the Education Department of the Ministry of Health wrote an article that talked entirely about medical treatment, without mentioning prevention. Only treating illness, not preventing it, the number of patients will increase. Yan Jingqing, Director of the Beijing Municipal Public Health Bureau, said: When the Ministry of Health issues funding quotas, there are always eight characters: "Take care of the general, ensure the key points." The key point is medical treatment. Once it is ensured, the so-called general prevention can be taken care of or not. Ye Gongshao, a professor at Beijing Medical College, said: In 1957, there were 32,000 health workers in Beijing, of which no more than 1,000 were epidemic prevention workers. Some places built large hospitals, but because there were no doctors, they could not open for consultation for one or two years, while the epidemic prevention stations did not even have a location. Experts believe that preventive work is the "heavy industry" in health work and hope that the Ministry of Health will build this "heavy industry."

The leadership of health work must be based on medical science, which is also an issue that experts have raised many opinions on. Jin Baoshan suggested that the leaders of health work must bring scientists over to work with them and not let them only be in a position to offer advice from the sidelines. He, along with pharmacist Zhou Jinhuang and nutritionist Yang Sifu, mentioned that the health department urgently needs to improve the Scientific Work Committee or the Academic Committee to give this type of organization the authority and power to truly promote and supervise health work from a scientific perspective.

In their speeches, the experts also pointed out that there are still serious bureaucratic phenomena in the leadership and arrangement of many undertakings by the Ministry of Health. Shen Qian, a Western medicine doctor working at the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine, and traditional Chinese medicine doctors Long Bojian and Ma Jixing, all pointed out that the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine is now accumulating a large number of Chinese and Western medicine talents who have nothing to do. No research has been carried out. It is neither like a research institution, nor like an educational institution, nor like a medical institution. Many people are passing their years leisurely, simply like a nursing home; and artificially creating many sectarian sentiments between Chinese and Western medicine; there are also situations of using administrative orders and one voice in academic work. Sixty-one-year-old physician Shen Qian exclaimed loudly: "I have wasted a lot of time, and I still have nothing to do. In today's society, I don't want to retire, I demand work."

The experts also talked about premature and incorrect propaganda on medical experiences whose effectiveness has not been determined, which has brought many losses to health work and the people, but the health administration department has not paid attention to correcting this.

The symposium was presided over by Li Dequan, Minister of Health. Xu Yunbei, Cui Yitian, Zhang Kai and other Deputy Ministers of Health attended the symposium.

The symposium will also be held by specialty next week.

    只看病，不防病，病人越来越多！
    中医研究院积压大批人材没有事作
    首都医药卫生界人士批评卫生部的官僚主义
    新华社5日讯　卫生部在过去两天邀请北京各个医学科学研究机构、各高等医学院校和各大医院的专家、教授们举行座谈会，听取他们关于在卫生工作中如何贯彻“百花齐放、百家争鸣”方针的意见。
    专家、教授们在发言中强调地指出我国卫生工作的一个带根本的缺点，就是“预防为主”的方向被忽略了。公共卫生学专家金宝善说：我们从城市到乡村，都是医疗事业发展很大，预防工作发展很少。整个医学教育也如此。卫生部教育司司长写文章就是整篇谈医疗，没有谈到预防。只看病，不防病，病人就越来越多了。北京市公共卫生局局长严镜清说：卫生部下达经费指标时，总是有八个字“照顾一般，保证重点”。重点是医疗，一保证，对所谓一般的预防就可以照顾也可以不照顾了。北京医学院教授叶恭绍说：1957年北京市的卫生工作人员是三万二千人，其中防疫工作人员不超过一千人。有的地方盖了大医院，因为没有医师一年两年还不能开诊，而防疫站却连站址都没有。专家们认为预防工作是卫生工作中的“重工业”，希望卫生部把这个“重工业”建设起来。
    卫生工作的领导必须建立在医学科学的基础上，也是专家们提出意见较多的问题。金宝善建议卫生工作的领导人员一定要把科学家拉过来和他们一起办事，不要让他们只处于从旁建议的地位。他和药学家周金黄、营养学家杨思孚都提到卫生部门急需要把科学工作委员会或学术委员会健全起来，使这种组织有职有权，真正对卫生工作从科学上起一些推动和监察作用。
    专家在发言中还指出卫生部对许多事业的领导和安排还存在严重的官僚主义现象。在中医研究院工作的西医师沈谦和中医师龙伯坚、马季星，都指出了中医研究院现在积压着大批中西医人材，没有事作，什么研究都没有展开，既不像研究机构，又不像教育机构，也不像医疗机构，许多人悠悠岁月，简直像养老院；并且人为地制造许多中西医之间的宗派情绪；在学术工作上也有用行政命令和一家独鸣的情况。六十一岁的沈谦医师大声疾呼地说：“我已经浪费了许多时间了，现在还没有事作。在今天这样的社会，我不愿养老，我要求工作。”
    专家们还谈到了对效果并未确定的医疗经验作过早的不正确的宣传，这给卫生工作和人民群众都带来了许多损失，但卫生行政部门对这也并未注意纠正。
    座谈会是由卫生部部长李德全主持的，卫生部副部长徐运北、崔义田、张凯等都参加座谈会。
    座谈会下星期还要分专业举行。
