Chen the technician's family has a small five-tube radio. He bought it last August.

Before this, he went to his old friend Geng Shun's house every night to listen to the radio. It wasn't that Chen couldn't afford a radio. He was one of the top-rated eighth-grade workers in the factory, and his family was small. It was just that he was a glutton and loved to eat and drink, so he never saved any money from month to month. Because of this, Sister-in-law Chen often got angry with him.

Once, late at night, he came back from Geng's house after listening to a radio opera, and Sister-in-law Chen locked the door. He wanted to jump in through the window. This made Sister-in-law Chen furious, and she said, "What exactly are you thinking, soaking at other people's place in the middle of the night! Do you love listening so much? Save up money and buy one yourself, so the whole family can listen!"

Since then, Chen started saving money. After receiving his salary, he handed over all the remaining money to Sister-in-law Chen, after deducting meal tickets, Party dues, union fees, and some small pocket money.

Six months later, one day, Sister-in-law Chen heard from a neighbor that the Fang family in Xikou had spent forty yuan to buy an old three-tube radio. Chen hurried to feel it and look at it, and came back wanting to go into the city. Sister-in-law Chen said, "It's not enough! I've only saved twenty-five." Chen took out a paper package from his pocket, counted it, and there were exactly thirty-two yuan. This stunned Sister-in-law Chen: "Where did you get so much money?" "Where from? Saved it. Five yuan a month, five sixes are thirty."

Chen chased the setting sun in the west and went into the city, but came back empty-handed after dark. It wasn't that he hadn't seen radios. There were old ones for forty or fifty, fifty or sixty yuan, but he decided not to buy one yet. Back home, he discussed it with Sister-in-law Chen:

"It's much better to buy a new one for seventy or eighty yuan, why should we buy an old one!" Sister-in-law Chen said, "Okay, I knew you'd come back to ask me for more money. There's none left!" Chen knew that Sister-in-law Chen had money, but it was hard to ask for, so he said, "If you don't spend the money you have soon, I'm sure to take it!" Sister-in-law Chen said, "Dare you!" But she herself dared not save any more money, and in the afternoon quickly bought enough coal, rice, and daily necessities for next month.

Not long after, the beginning of the month came again, and Chen received his salary. He was supposed to hand over fifty yuan, but he only took out twenty-five yuan.

	"How can you only give me half?" Sister-in-law Chen immediately glared.

	"How can you ask me for more?"

	"You're playing tricks on me!"

	"How am I playing tricks? Didn't you already buy enough firewood and rice for this month? You still want more?"

	"Alas, I fell for your trick!"

Chen had more than eighty yuan in his hand. But the second time he went to the city, he was disappointed. The new radios he had seen last time were sold out. This time, Sister-in-law Chen was happy: "You, you're destined not to buy one. If I were you, I'd just forget about buying it, and I'd get myself a leather-lined jacket!" Coincidentally, the supplementary wage increase was issued at this time. Chen received eighty or so yuan, didn't even go home, and went straight into the city from the factory after work.

Since Chen had the radio, his life had changed. As soon as he got off work, he hurried home if there was nothing else to do. When comrades from the group bought movie tickets to give him, he always had a more exciting program: "No, tonight is 'Si Lang Visits His Mother,' with Ma Lianliang, Tan Fuying, Xi Xiaobo, and Zhang Junqiu performing together. This is a rare opportunity!" It's really interesting, sometimes Chen would press his ear close to the radio; sometimes, when the gongs and drums sounded, he would pull at his collar and sing, pacing like an official. This made his youngest son say, "Hey, my dad's gone crazy!" Sister-in-law Chen also liked to listen to opera, but she wasn't as addicted as he was. After eleven o'clock at night, he would still sit by the radio shaking his head, making Sister-in-law Chen have to use a lot of effort to push him down and cover him with a quilt before she could stop him.

Do you think Chen only listened to opera? No, he never missed a news program because he was listening to opera or songs. Once, Sister-in-law Chen couldn't understand the broadcast about the Beijing-Lhasa air route opening, and asked, "Pull what, pull what? Where is this place?" The next day, Chen bought the latest map back. Since then, the couple listened to the news and looked for places on the map. Where is Xinjiang, where is Tibet, where is Port Said in Egypt. The two of them talked about world affairs in their small room.

In early November of last year, when the Hungarian incident broke out, the Chen family showed more concern and anxiety than other families: "What do you think the ending will be?" Chen said. "No matter what, the handle of the knife must not be taken away," Sister-in-law Chen said. And that night, when the opera broadcast was suddenly interrupted and the announcer interjected to report that Comrade Kadar had organized the Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government and defeated the counter-revolutionaries with the help of the Soviet army, Sister-in-law Chen immediately prepared some wine and dishes for Chen and took out a bottle of Erguotou that had been hidden for more than half a year.

When Sister-in-law Chen was a young girl, she learned a good hand of embroidery. Recently, she embroidered two pillowcases for Chen. They were embroidered with canna lilies, red hydrangea, peonies, and more peonies. Neighbor Aunt Wang asked her, "Look at what you've embroidered for your old man, are these wedding night pillows!" Sister-in-law Chen said, "Didn't you hear the radio report about Chairman Mao's call, this is a hundred flowers blooming!"

    五灯收音机
    焦桐
    陈师傅家里有一架小巧的五灯收音机了。这是去年八月几儿买的。
    这以前，他每晚总到老伙友耿顺家去听收音机。陈师傅不是买不起收音机。他是厂里有数的八级工，家中人口也少。只因为他嘴上馋，好吃喝，所以月顶月半个钱也剩不下。为此陈大嫂常生他的气。
    有一次，深夜，他从耿家听广播大戏回来，陈大嫂把门关了。他要跳窗进来。可把陈大嫂惹火了，说：“你到底是怎么个主意，深更半夜还在人家里沤！爱听吗，攒住钱自己也买一架，一家大小都听！”
    自此，陈师傅就开始攒钱了。工资发下来，刨去买饭票，交党费、工会费和一些小零花钱之外，所余扫数交陈大嫂。
    六个月后的一天，陈大嫂串门子听说，西口方家花了四十元，买了架旧的三灯收音机。陈师傅忙去摸了看了，回来就要进城。陈大嫂说：“不够啊！我这才攒了二十五。”陈师傅从怀里掏出个纸包，打开一数，整整三十二元。这一下可把陈大嫂给楞住了：“你哪来的这么多钱？”“哪来的，攒的。一个月五块吧，五六三十。”
    陈师傅追着西山的落日进了城，可是掌灯以后空手回来了。他不是没见到收音机。四、五十，五、六十元的都有，可都是旧的，他决计先不买。回来，他和陈大嫂商量：
  “七、八十元买新的多好，咱为什么买旧的呢！”陈大嫂说：“好，我就知道你准回来叫我添钱。没有啦！”陈师傅知道陈大嫂手里有钱，但是不好要，就说：“你手里的钱不快花掉，我准得把它拿过来！”陈大嫂说：“你敢！”可是她自己却不敢再存钱了，下午赶紧把下个月的煤、米、日用品都买足了。
    隔不多天又到了月头，陈师傅领下工资，应交出五十元，他只拿出二十五元来。
      “你怎么能只给我一半呀？”陈大嫂立时瞪着眼。
      “你怎么能跟我多要呀？”
      “你这是跟我耍赖皮呀！”
    “怎么耍赖皮，这月的柴和米，你不是已经全买足啦，还想多要？”
      “唉，我上了你一当！”
    陈师傅手里有八十多元了。可是第二次进城，好扫兴，上回见的那种新收音机卖光了。这回，可把陈大嫂乐的：“你呀，命定不该买。我要是你呀，买不着就算，我来它一件皮里小大衣！”可巧，这时候补发的追加工资下来了。陈师傅领了八十来元，连家也没回，下班后，从厂里一直进城了。
    陈师傅自从有了收音机，生活就发生了变化。下了班只要没事，他赶紧往家跑。小组同志买好电影票送去，他哪回都有更精彩的节目：“不行，今晚上四郎探母，马连良、谭富英、奚啸伯、张君秋合演，这机会难得呀！”说来真有意思，有时陈师傅把个耳朵紧贴着收音机；有时锣鼓点一响，他扯着衣襟，摆方步唱起来。弄得小儿子说：“嘿，我爸爸疯啦！”陈大嫂也爱听大戏，可没他那么大的瘾。晚上十一点多了，他还坐在收音机旁摇晃着个脑袋，弄得陈大嫂费好大力气，把他搬倒，拿被将他蒙起来，这才罢休。
    你当陈师傅只听唱戏？不，他从来不因为听戏、听歌而少听一次新闻节目。有一次，陈大嫂听不明白广播北京拉萨通航，就问：“拉啥，拉什么？这地方在哪？”第二天，陈师傅买了张最新的地图回来。自此，老俩口子一面听新闻，一面就在地图上找。新疆在哪，西藏在哪，埃及的塞得港在哪。两人在斗室中谈起天下大事来。
    去年11月初，当匈牙利事件爆发的时候，陈家表现出比别家更突出的关心和焦急：“你说会落到怎么个结局？”陈师傅说。“管怎么着，刀把子可千万不能给夺了去。”陈大嫂说。而在那天夜里，当转播戏忽然中断，播音员插进来报告卡达尔同志组织工农革命政府，在苏军帮助下击败了反革命的时候，陈大嫂立即给陈师傅弄了点酒菜，把藏了半年多的一瓶二锅头拿出来。
    陈大嫂年青当姑娘的时候，学得一手好刺绣。最近，她给陈师傅扎了两个枕头套。上边绣的又有美人蕉，又有红绣球，又有芍药和牡丹。邻居王大娘问她：“你看你给你老头子绣的这是入洞房的枕头啦！”陈大嫂说：“你没听话匣子里报告的毛主席号召，这是百花齐放哩！”
