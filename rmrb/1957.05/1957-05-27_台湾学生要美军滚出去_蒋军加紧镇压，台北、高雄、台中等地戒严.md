    蒋军加紧镇压，台北、高雄、台中等地戒严
    新华社26日讯　据外国通讯社和国民党中央社消息，在台中、台南等地，25日下午都有学生把写着“美军滚出去”等口号的传单标语，投入美国人的住宅。台北美联社昨天收到了一张明信片，写着“请告诉驻在台湾的美国军队，我们将用手榴弹来为刘自然之死报仇”。
    被捣毁的美国“大使馆”内，墙壁上写满了许多标语，要求美国侵略者滚出台湾去。
    据新华社26日讯　台北市今天仍在戒严中。晚上十二时到次晨五时实施全面宵禁。大批蒋军进驻市区和近郊地区。在许多街道的重要地段和美国人的机关、住宅附近，蒋军架设了机关枪。蒋军和宪兵、警察遍布市内。美国“大使馆”及其附近的道路，都被蒋军和警察封锁，禁止行人和车辆通过。美国驻台湾军事援助顾问团总部附近的街道仍由蒋军把守，渺无行人。
    驻台湾美军顾问团的电台要求在台湾的美国人，不管是军人或其他人员，都留在家中，不要外出。平日在台湾经常辗死市民的美军车辆，已很少在街头出现。美军粮库和军中商店已暂时关闭。
    新华社26日讯　外国通讯社台北消息，台湾高雄地区25日宣布戒严和宵禁。台中地区也从今天上午零时起实行戒严和宵禁。
