Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, May 22nd: The Executive Committee of the International Confederation of Arab Trade Unions unanimously agreed at its meeting on May 20th that the General Secretariat of the Confederation should take steps to establish an Asian-African trade union organization.

The Executive Committee also unanimously adopted the joint statement of support for convening a broadly representative Asian-African trade union conference, signed by the General Secretary of the Confederation, Fazi Kamel, and the head of the Chinese trade union delegation, Dong Xin, Secretary of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, in April of this year.

The Executive Committee will form a preparatory committee to contact various labor organizations in Asian and African countries to be responsible for the preparatory work for the Asian-African trade union conference.

The Executive Committee reiterated its support for Egypt's nationalization of the Suez Canal, and Egypt's right to prevent ships of countries at war with Egypt from passing through the canal.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, May 22nd: The Executive Committee of the International Confederation of Arab Trade Unions passed a resolution calling for the prohibition of atomic weapons and atomic weapons testing.

The General Secretary of the Confederation, Fazi Kamel, announced the committee's resolutions on the evening of the 21st, after the Executive Committee held a four-day meeting.

The Executive Committee also resolved to endorse the idea of convening an Asian-African trade union conference, as mentioned in the joint communiqué issued last month by the Confederation and the Chinese trade union delegation.

The resolution stated that the Confederation opposes all military treaties and economic assistance aimed at undermining Arab nationalism and subjecting Arab countries to imperialist bondage. The resolution expressed full support for the policy of positive neutrality.

The resolution considered that the proposals for a "peaceful settlement" between Israel and the Arabs are an attack on human rights, as this would prevent Palestinian refugees from returning home. The Confederation supports the position taken by Egypt and Saudi Arabia in prohibiting Israeli ships from passing through the Suez Canal and the Gulf of Aqaba, considering it an act of defending their territorial waters.

The Confederation called for the establishment of labor organizations in all Arab countries and the unification of Arab labor legislation.

    新华社开罗22日电　阿拉伯工会国际联合会执行委员会在5月20日的会议上一致同意，联合会总书记处应当采取步骤成立亚非工会组织。
    执行委员会还一致通过了由联合会总书记法齐·卡迈勒和中国工会代表团团长、中华全国总工会书记处书记董昕在今年4月签署的支持召开一次具有广泛代表性的亚非工会会议的主张的联合声明。
    执行委员会将组成一个筹备委员会同亚非国家的各劳工组织联系，负责进行亚非工会会议的预备工作。
    执行委员会重新表示支持埃及把苏伊士运河收归国有，以及支持埃及有权利不让和埃及处于战争状态的国家的船只通过运河。

    联合会总书记法齐·卡迈勒在执行委员会举行四天会议后，21日晚宣布了委员会的决议。
    执行委员会还决议赞成在联合会和中国工会代表团上月发表的联合公报中所提到的召开亚非工会会议的意见。
    决议说，联合会反对一切旨在破坏阿拉伯民族主义和使阿拉伯国家受帝国主义束缚的军事条约和经济援助。决议表示完全支持积极中立政策。
    决议认为，关于以色列和阿拉伯之间实行“和平解决”的主张是对人权的攻击，因为这将使巴勒斯坦难民不能回家。联合会支持埃及和沙特阿拉伯所采取的禁止以色列船只通过苏伊士运河和亚喀巴湾的立场，认为这是保卫它们领水的行动。
    联合会号召在所有阿拉伯国家建立劳工组织，并且统一阿拉伯人的劳工立法。
