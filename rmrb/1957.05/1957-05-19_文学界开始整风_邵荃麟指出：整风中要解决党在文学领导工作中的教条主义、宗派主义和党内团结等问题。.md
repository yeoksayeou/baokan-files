Literary Circles Begin Rectification

Shao Quanlin Points Out That Rectification Should Resolve Problems of Dogmatism, Sectarianism, and Intra-Party Unity in the Party's Leadership of Literature

(Our Dispatch) The rectification movement in the Chinese Writers Association and literary circles has begun.

The Party Group of the Chinese Writers Association convened a mobilization meeting for rectification within its organization on May 17th. Shao Quanlin, the Party Group Secretary, said at the meeting that the rectification in literary circles is not limited to the Writers Association but, more importantly, to rectify the Party's guiding ideology and work style in leading the national literary field. What are the problems of internal contradictions among the people manifested on the literary front? Generally speaking, it is the contradiction between the people's demands for the development of literature and art and the current literary undertaking's inability to meet the people's needs. Shao Quanlin pointed out that the main contradictions in the Writers Association and literary circles are in the following aspects: First, guiding ideology and methods. The main guiding ideology is dogmatism (of course, there is also right-leaning opportunism). Rigid rules and regulations for literary creation, simplistic and crude leadership criticism, and administrative intervention are all manifestations of dogmatism. In terms of leadership methods, the main problem is the bureaucratic work style of being detached from the masses and reality. Beijing and Shanghai have both criticized the Writers Association for being bureaucratic and too focused on administrative work, and have also criticized the Writers Association for not doing its proper job. These problems must be resolved through this rectification. Second, the relationship between Party members and non-Party members, which is the issue of sectarianism. This problem is very serious. The first manifestation is the Party taking over everything, or taking over but not doing anything, or taking over and doing things badly. The vast majority of chief editors or heads of publications and literary publishing houses are Party members, and they are in charge of everything. Party member writers often have a sense of superiority and exclusivity, which makes people keep their distance. The status of Party member writers and non-Party member writers is also unequal. This hinders the development of creative forces and the implementation of the policy of unity and transformation. Only by uniting a wide range of writers can creative forces be truly brought into play and the literary and art undertaking be prospered. Without seriously solving this problem, the "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" policy will not work. Therefore, a demolition movement must be launched, starting with Party member comrades. Third, there is the issue of intra-Party unity. Shanghai has raised the issue of "walls within the Party and ditches outside the Party," and this phenomenon also exists in the Writers Associations in Beijing and other places. That is to say, there is serious sectarianism between Party members, and if this problem is not resolved, it will inevitably affect unity inside and outside the Party. A solution must be found during the rectification movement.

Shao Quanlin pointed out that, in order to carry out rectification well, leaders must let go and dispel concerns; it is necessary to eliminate three fears, namely fear of difficulty, fear of being wronged, and fear of trouble; and it is necessary to adopt the method of gentle breeze and light rain, that is, to adopt the method of seeking truth from facts and curing diseases to save people.

In order to freely launch the rectification movement, the Party Group of the Chinese Writers Association is also preparing to immediately hold various forums and heart-to-heart talks to extensively listen to the criticisms and opinions of Party member and non-Party member writers, critics, translators, and young writers, and to solicit opinions from local branches and literary federations.

    文学界开始整风
    邵荃麟指出：整风中要解决党在文学领导工作中的教条主义、宗派主义和党内团结等问题。
    本报讯　中国作家协会和文学界的整风运动已经开始。
    中国作家协会党组在5月17日召开了本机关的整风动员大会。党组书记邵荃麟在会上说，文学界整风，不仅限于作家协会机关内，更重要的是要整一整党在全国文学界方面的领导思想和领导作风。人民内部矛盾表现在文学战线上的问题是什么呢？总的讲来就是人民对文艺发展的要求同当前文学事业不能满足人民需要的矛盾。邵荃麟指出作家协会和文学界的主要矛盾有以下几个方面：第一，领导思想和领导方法。领导思想主要是教条主义（当然也有右倾机会主义）。文艺创作的清规戒律，领导批评上的简单化、粗暴、行政干涉，都是教条主义的表现。在领导方法上主要是脱离群众脱离实际的官僚主义作风。北京和上海都批评作家协会衙门化，机关化，又批评作家协会不务正业。通过这次整风，必须解决这些问题。第二，党与非党的关系，也就是宗派主义的问题。这问题很严重。首先是表现在党包办，或包而不办，还有包而办坏。绝大多数的刊物、文艺出版社的主编或负责人都是党员，而且是包办的。党员作家常常有一种党员的优越感，排他性，使人家敬而远之。党员作家与非党员作家地位也不平等。这阻碍了创作力量的发展，阻碍了团结改造的方针的贯彻。要团结广泛的作家，才能真正发挥创作力量，才能繁荣文艺事业，不认真解决这问题，百花齐放、百家争鸣是行不通的。所以必须来个拆墙运动，首先是从党员同志拆起。第三，是党内团结的问题。上海提出党内有墙党外有沟，这现象在北京和其他一些地方作家协会也都存在。就是说党员与党员之间，存在着严重的宗派主义，这个问题不解决，也就必然影响党内外的团结。在整风运动中必须求得解决。
    邵荃麟指出：为了搞好整风，一定要做到领导必须放手，解除顾虑；要解除三怕，即怕难、怕委屈、怕麻烦；要采取和风细雨的方法，也就是采取实事求是，治病救人的办法。
    为了放手展开整风运动，中国作家协会党组并准备立即举行各种座谈会、谈心会，广泛听取党内外作家，批评家，翻译家，青年作家的批评意见，并征求各地分会和文联的意见。
