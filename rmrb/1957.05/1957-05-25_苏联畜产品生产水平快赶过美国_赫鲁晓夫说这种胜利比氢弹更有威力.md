Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 24th - Soviet Communist Party Central Committee First Secretary Khrushchev said that the achievements already made in Soviet agriculture and the good prospects for development make it possible for us to propose and solve a task of great national significance - to catch up with the United States in the production of meat, milk and fats per capita in the next few years.

Khrushchev spoke on the 22nd at a conference of agricultural workers in the Northwest Region of the Russian Federation held in Leningrad. Khrushchev said that, in terms of per capita production, the Soviet Union's milk production can not only catch up with the United States by 1958, but also exceed it. This year our butter production is already the same as, or even higher than, the United States' production last year, but our population is larger, and we should work even harder.

Khrushchev pointed out that the Soviet Union's meat production per capita could catch up with the United States in 1960 or 1961. In order to achieve this, it is necessary to increase the Soviet Union's meat production by 2.15 times compared to 1956. Khrushchev believes that the competition being carried out in various regions of the Soviet Union may shorten this period.

In his speech, Khrushchev cited the per capita output of livestock products in the Soviet Union and the United States. In 1956, the Soviet Union's per capita meat production was 32.3 kilograms, milk was 245 kilograms, and fats were 2.8 kilograms; the United States' meat production was 102.3 kilograms, milk was 343 kilograms, and fats were 3.8 kilograms. Calculated on the basis of 100 hectares of agricultural land, last year the Soviet Union's meat (net weight) production was 13.3 quintals, and milk was 101 quintals; the United States' figures were 33 quintals and 111 quintals respectively.

Khrushchev said that in order to catch up with the United States in per capita production of meat and milk, we must produce 42 quintals of meat (net weight) and 141 quintals of milk on every 100 hectares of agricultural land. Can we do it? I think we can, and we can go even further. Our potential is great, as long as we make good use of it.

Khrushchev disagreed with some economists who believed that Soviet meat production would not catch up with the United States until 1975. He criticized this view, saying: the strength of the collective farm system, the patriotism of the Soviet people, and socialist competition enable us to solve this problem in the next few years, and to catch up with the United States in per capita production of meat, milk, and fats during the Sixth Five-Year Plan period. He said that we should win in this competition. Our victory in this area will be more powerful than a hydrogen bomb.

Khrushchev said: Currently, the imperialists have "invented" a "theory." They say: "The Soviet Union has hydrogen bombs, and the United States has them too, and now Britain has them as well. Since hydrogen bombs are extremely powerful weapons, neither side will use them, but will use hydrogen bombs to scare each other, conduct a cold war, and live according to the principle of 'neither fighting nor peace'." We Soviet people oppose this principle. We are in favor of peace and demand the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons, and we also call on the United States and Britain to do the same. We don't want to bomb the capitalist world. If our per capita meat, milk, and fat production levels can catch up with the United States, it will be equivalent to launching a very powerful torpedo against the foundations of capitalism.

Khrushchev continued, the Central Committee of the CPSU and the Soviet government are studying the issue of stopping the sale of agricultural products from the private economies of collective farmers to the state, starting from January 1958. Khrushchev said, I think this is a victory for all of us. This is not only an economic victory, but also a political victory.

Moscow, 24th (by our reporter) - Soviet rural areas have sown more than three-quarters of the spring crops. The sowing of cotton, sugar beets, and sunflowers has been completed in the south, and neat rows of green seedlings are growing in the fields. In Ukraine and the North Caucasus, winter wheat has begun to spike. Spring sowing is still continuing in the Urals and Siberia, with more than three million hectares of grain being sown every day.

The spring sowing plan has been completed in Kazakhstan, with a total of more than 22.2 million hectares of grain sown. Agricultural workers in this republic continue to overfulfill the sowing of grain and legume crops. They have cultivated 500,000 hectares of wasteland this year. It is planned to cultivate 1.1 million hectares to increase grain planting.

### 苏联畜产品生产水平快赶过美国  赫鲁晓夫说这种胜利比氢弹更有威力

    苏联畜产品生产水平快赶过美国
    赫鲁晓夫说这种胜利比氢弹更有威力
    新华社莫斯科24日电　苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记赫鲁晓夫说，苏联农业上已经取得的成就和发展的良好远景使我们有可能提出并解决具有重大国家意义的任务——在最近几年内，在肉类、牛奶和油脂的生产上按人口平均计算赶上美国。
    赫鲁晓夫22日在列宁格勒举行的俄罗斯联邦西北地区农业工作者会议上讲了话。赫鲁晓夫说，按人口平均计算，苏联的牛奶产量到1958年不仅可以赶上美国，而且还可以超过美国。今年我们的牛油产量已和美国去年的产量一样，或者还要超过它，但是我们的人口多些，我们还应进一步努力。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，苏联的肉类产量按人口平均计算可以在1960年或者1961年赶上美国。为了达到这一点，必须要使苏联的肉类产量比1956年增加二点一五倍。赫鲁晓夫认为，在苏联各地区展开的竞赛可能会使这个期限缩短。
    赫鲁晓夫在演说中举出了苏联和美国按人口平均计算的畜产品的产量。1956年，苏联按人口平均计算的肉类产量是三十二点三公斤，牛奶是二百四十五公斤，油脂是二点八公斤；美国肉类是一○二点三公斤，牛奶是三百四十三公斤，油脂是三点八公斤。按一百公顷农业用地计算，去年苏联肉类（净重）产量是十三点三公担，牛奶是一百零一公担；美国前者是三十三公担，后者是一百一十一公担。
    赫鲁晓夫说，为了使肉类和牛奶按人口平均的生产量赶上美国，我们必须在每一百公顷的农业用地上生产四十二公担肉类（净重）和一百四十一公担牛奶。我们做不做得到呢？我看我们能够并且还能走得更远。我们的潜力很大，只要很好地加以利用。
    赫鲁晓夫不同意某些经济学家认为苏联的肉类生产要在1975年才能赶上美国的看法。他批评这种看法的时候说：集体农庄制度的力量、苏维埃人的爱国主义和社会主义竞赛使我们有可能在最近几年解决这个问题，并且在第六个五年计划期间内使肉类、奶类和油脂生产按人口平均计算赶上美国。他说，我们应当在这个竞赛中取得胜利。我们在这方面的胜利要比氢弹更为有力。
    赫鲁晓夫说：目前帝国主义者“发明”了一种“理论”。他们说：“苏联有氢弹，美国也有，而现在英国也有了。既然氢弹是一种威力极大的武器，那末两方面都不会使用它，但是会用氢弹互相恐吓，进行冷战并且根据‘既不打仗，也不和平’的原则来过活。”我们苏联人反对这个原则。我们拥护和平，要求禁止原子武器和氢武器并且也呼吁美国和英国这样办。我们不想用炸弹炸掉资本主义世界。如果我们的肉类、奶类和油脂生产水平按人口平均计算能赶上美国，就等于我们向资本主义基础放出了一枚极有威力的鱼雷。
    赫鲁晓夫继续说，苏共中央和苏联政府正在研究从1958年1月起停止要集体农庄庄员从个人经济中向国家交售农产品的问题。赫鲁晓夫说，我认为这是我们大家的胜利。这不仅是经济上的胜利，而且也是政治上的胜利。
    本报莫斯科24日电　苏联农村已经播种了四分之三以上的春季作物。在南部已经完成棉花、甜菜、向日葵的播种，田野上长出一片片整齐的绿苗。在乌克兰和北高加索，冬小麦开始抽穗。春播工作还在乌拉尔、西伯利亚一带继续着，每天播种三百多万公顷谷物。
    在哈萨克斯坦已完成春播计划，共播种了二千二百多万公顷谷物。这个共和国的农业劳动者继续超额播种谷类和豆类作物。他们今年已开垦了五十万公顷荒地。计划开垦到一百一十万公顷，以增种谷物。
