    Korean Government Decides to Provide 100,000 Seok of Rice Free of Charge
    To Aid Millions of Starving Compatriots in South Korea
    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 8th - According to a broadcast by the Korean Central Broadcasting Station, the Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea yesterday passed a resolution to provide 100,000 seok of rice free of charge to aid starving farmers in South Korea.
    The resolution stated that the famine in South Korea has recently become very serious, with millions of people facing starvation. According to a recent report in the "Dong-A Ilbo," 43.5% of the 2.25 million farm households in South Korea, or 980,000 households, have run out of food. Starving farmers are filling their stomachs with grass roots and tree bark, and the number of people dying of hunger and committing suicide is increasing daily. However, the South Korean authorities are not taking any measures to help the starving farmers who are asking for aid.
    The resolution pointed out that since the United States occupied South Korea, South Korea's national economy has been declining. After the armistice, the US war policy has placed a heavy burden on the people of South Korea. In the past, South Korea was known as a granary, but last year South Korea's summer grain production was only 61% of the average annual production between 1936 and 1940, and autumn grain was 60%.
    The resolution stated that the people of the northern part of the Republic, out of brotherly love, expressed deep sympathy for the tragic situation of their South Korean compatriots.
    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 8th - Kim Il, Minister of Agriculture of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, said in a letter to Chung Un-kap, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry of South Korea, today that the Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has decided to provide 100,000 seok of rice to aid starving farmers in South Korea. He requested that Chung Un-kap propose a location and method for the handover of the relief rice and hoped for a reply without delay.
    Kim Il's letter said that he was authorized to convey this decision to Chung Un-kap and hoped that he would provide the necessary assistance to realize this decision full of brotherly love and to quickly meet the needs of South Korean farmers.

    朝鲜政府决定无偿提供十万石米
    救济南朝鲜数百万断粮同胞
    新华社平壤8日电　据朝鲜中央广播电台广播，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁昨天通过决议要无偿地提供十万石大米救济南朝鲜的断粮农户。
    决议说，最近南朝鲜的粮荒十分严重，数百万人陷于饥饿状态。据最近的“东亚日报”报道，南朝鲜的二百二十五万户农户中有43.5％，即有九十八万户断了粮。断粮的农民以草根、树皮充饥，饿死的人和自杀的人在逐日增加。但是南朝鲜当局对于要求救济的断粮农户不采取任何措施。
    决议指出，美国霸占南朝鲜后使南朝鲜的民族经济日益衰落，停战后由于美国的战争政策使南朝鲜人民担负起沉重的负担。过去南朝鲜被称为谷仓，但是去年南朝鲜的夏粮产量只等于1936年到1940年间平均年产量的61％，秋粮等于60％。
    决议说，共和国北部人民从同胞之爱出发，对南朝鲜同胞的悲惨遭遇表示深切的同情。
    新华社平壤8日电　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国农业相金一今天在给南朝鲜农林部长官郑云甲的一封信中说，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁决定提供十万石大米救济南朝鲜断粮农民，请郑云甲提出交接救济米的地点和方法，并且希望毫不迟延地给予答复。
    金一的信说，他受权向郑云甲转达这个决定，同时希望他给予应有的协助，以便实现这个充满同胞友爱的决定，迅速满足南朝鲜农民的要求。
