This Newspaper's Composite Report: Following the Jordan incident, the United States' plot to interfere in Syria and create a new Middle East crisis has become increasingly blatant.

International News Service Washington correspondent, May 1, citing a U.S. official "prediction" said: "The next Middle East crisis will erupt in Syria."

According to reports, U.S. officials believe that, given the current tensions in Syria due to the Jordan crisis, the time has come for anti-leftist elements to "promote" their strength. They are particularly hopeful that anti-leftist elements will find ways to "win" in the upcoming parliamentary by-elections in Syria on May 4. U.S. officials hope that this could cause a "chain reaction," eventually leading to the downfall of the current Syrian government, and the "formation of a conservative regime, and the division of the Syrian-Egyptian alliance," leaving "Egyptian President Nasser politically isolated."

U.S. officials also "anticipate" that there may be "a showdown battle" in Syria, in which "violence may occur."

According to a "New York Herald Tribune" May 2 dispatch, in recent days, Turkey has "quietly" amassed "elite infantry and armored units" along the Syrian border, so that they "can play the greatest role in the event of war in the Middle East." A dispatch from Istanbul says that the Syrian government has protested to the Turkish government in a note on May 2, due to Turkish air force aircraft violating Syrian airspace during exercises.

This Newspaper News: British Labour Party leader Bevan, on May 2, attacked the United States' Middle East policy when speaking to reporters from London radio. Bevan said that every aspect of the United States' approach in the Middle East will be met with hostility. The United States in the Middle East is "replacing Britain and France," and the "result will be just as tragic as (Britain and France), and the hostility incurred will be exactly the same."

    美官方暗示将向叙利亚下毒手
    期望保守势力复辟以分裂埃叙同盟
    叙利亚抗议土耳其空军侵犯领空
    本报综合报道　继约旦事件之后，美国企图干涉叙利亚，制造新的中东危机的阴谋，已经越来越露骨了。
    国际新闻社驻华盛顿记者5月1日援引美国官员的“预言”说：“下一个中东危机将在叙利亚爆发”。
    据报道，美国官员们认为，在目前由于约旦危机而在叙利亚存在的紧张气氛下，那里反左派分子“显扬”力量的时刻已经到来。他们特别瞩望反左派分子设法在叙利亚即将在5月4日举行的议会补缺选举中“获得胜利”。美国官员希望这样就可以引起“链锁反应”，最后导致叙利亚现政府的倒台，而“组成一个保守的政权，以及叙利亚—埃及同盟的分裂”，使“埃及总统纳赛尔在政治上孤立”。
    美国官员还“预料”：可能会在叙利亚发生“一场摊牌性战斗”，在这场战斗中，“可能发生暴力行为”。
    另据“纽约先驱论坛报”5月2日消息，最近几天中，土耳其已“悄悄地”在叙利亚的边境线上集结“精锐的步兵和装甲部队”，以便它们“能够在一旦中东爆发战争的时候发挥最大作用。”伊斯坦布尔消息说，由于土耳其空军飞机在演习中侵犯了叙利亚的领空，叙利亚政府已于5月2日照会土耳其政府，提出抗议。
    本报讯　英国工党领导人之一比万5月2日对伦敦电台记者发表谈话时攻击美国的中东政策。比万说，美国在中东的做法每一方面都会遭到别人的敌视。美国在中东地区正在“取英法而代之”，其“结果也同（英法）同样地悲惨，并且所招致的敌视也是完全相同的”。（附图片）
