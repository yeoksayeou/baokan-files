    Wuhan City Formulates Plan for Placement of Primary and Secondary School Graduates
    (Our report) The Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Wuhan Municipal People's Committee have researched a preliminary plan for the placement of this summer's primary and secondary school graduates. Relevant units are actively carrying out specific preparations.
    Wuhan City is currently working on this task in three areas: First, investigating the number of students needed by agricultural production cooperatives to participate in agricultural production, in order to help a large number of graduates participate in agricultural production. At the same time, relevant units are studying the accommodation and living problems of these students in the early stages of participation in production with agricultural cooperatives, striving for proper arrangements. Second, there is a shortage of successors in the city's traditional Chinese medicine and Chinese herbal medicine industries, and there is also a shortage of personnel in life service industries such as hairdressing, catering, and photography. The Municipal Health Bureau and the Labor Bureau are further investigating and preparing to help some graduates participate in these industries. They are also calling on some graduates to learn the handicrafts their fathers and brothers are engaged in. Third, for some graduates who are young and unable to participate in production, it is advocated that various government agencies, enterprises, schools, and neighborhoods run self-study groups or remedial classes to help these students learn culture and technology, guided and assisted by the district and city self-study guidance committees.
    Currently, Wuhan City has launched extensive publicity activities on the placement of primary and secondary school students. All primary and secondary school teachers in the city have studied the People's Daily editorial "On the Issue of Primary and Secondary School Graduates Participating in Agricultural Production." The Wuhan Municipal Education Bureau also organized students from various schools to visit agricultural cooperatives in the suburbs during the April spring break to understand the lives and production of farmers. What is currently noteworthy is that some parents are trying every means to force students to "cram," affecting the students' physical and mental health. Some students also believe that "they won't be able to get into school anyway" and neglect their studies. These all need to be persuaded and educated.

    武汉市制订安排中小学毕业生方案
    本报讯　中共武汉市委和武汉市人民委员会，对于今年暑期中小学毕业生的安排问题，已研究出初步方案，各有关单位正在积极进行具体的准备。
    武汉市目前正从三个方面着手进行这个工作：一，调查农业生产合作社需要学生参加农业生产的数量，以便帮助大批毕业生参加农业生产。同时有关单位正在和农业社研究这些学生参加生产初期的住宿问题和生活问题，力求妥善安排。二，市内中医、中药业缺少接班人，理发、饮食、照像等生活服务行业也缺少一部分人，市卫生局和劳动局也正在进一步调查和准备，以帮助一部分毕业生参加这些行业。他们同时还号召一些毕业生学习父兄从事的手工业。三，对一些年龄小、不能参加生产的毕业生，提倡各机关、企业、学校和街道，自办自学小组或补习班，帮助这些学生学习文化和技术，由市区自学指导委员会予以指导和帮助。
    目前，武汉市对中小学生的安排问题已展开了广泛的宣传活动。全市中小学教师都学习了人民日报“关于中小学毕业生参加农业生产问题”的社论。武汉市教育局还在4月份的春假期间组织各校学生去郊区农业社参观，了解农民的生活和生产情况。目前值得注意的是：有些家长想尽各种办法逼着学生“擂功课”，影响学生身心健康，也有的学生认为“反正考不上学”，而荒废学业。这都需要加以说服教育。
