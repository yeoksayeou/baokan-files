Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, May 3rd: The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region's Nadam Fair, lasting three days, closed this afternoon.

	As the closing ceremony began, four Mongolian veteran wrestlers who had won the title of "Darhan" (an honorary title awarded to outstanding veteran wrestlers, Mongolian for "overwhelming advantage") walked to the rostrum amidst thunderous applause from the audience to demonstrate wrestling. Gao Tebayar, sixty-two years old, was the oldest wrestler, and his body was still very strong, no less majestic than when he won more than a hundred wrestling championships in Xilin Gol League and banners. After the performance by these four veteran wrestlers, they took off the leather clothing they had worn since they started wrestling at the age of nineteen and passed it on to the four best wrestlers in the autonomous region: Sengge, Adiya, Menghe, and Erhan Batur. They also embraced the young people who inherited their skills tightly, according to traditional customs. At this time, the audience cheered enthusiastically.

	The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Sports Commission, representing the Sports Commission of the People's Republic of China, officially awarded the titles of National Master Athlete and gold medals to Sengge, who won the heavyweight championship in last year's National Wrestling Championships; Sudanamu, second place in the light-heavyweight wrestling; Yidam, second place in the middleweight wrestling; and Qimide, first place in the lightweight wrestling. The winning athletes who participated in horse racing, wrestling, archery, and other competitions at this conference were all rewarded. In the prescribed 20, 30, and 40-meter distance archery, Aomulaxi scored 161 rings out of 30 shots (300 rings being a perfect score), which is 18 rings more than the highest record of Buhe Aoqier, the first place winner in last year's National Archery Performance Competition. Buhe Aoqier also exceeded his national first-place record from last year by four rings in this competition.

	The conference also featured some ancient ethnic sports. Po Lie ball (a type of sport of the Daur people), which was once popular during the Ming Dynasty, was performed for the audience for the first time since liberation. The gameplay of Po Lie ball is similar to ice hockey, with athletes using wooden sticks to hit a leather ball filled with cow hair. This performance aroused great interest among the audience.

	The number of attendees reached more than 110,000 person-times in three days.

    内蒙古那达慕大会闭幕
    三天观众十一万，四名摔跤手成运动健将
    新华社呼和浩特3日电　历时三天的内蒙古自治区那达慕大会今天下午闭幕。
    在闭幕式开始的时候，四名获得自治区“达尔罕”（是奖给优秀的老摔跤手的光荣称号，蒙语是占压倒优势的意思）称号的蒙古族老摔跤手在观众暴风雨般的掌声中走到主席台上，向观众表演了摔跤。六十二岁的高特巴雅尔是年龄最大的摔跤手，他的身体仍很健壮，不减当年获得锡林郭勒盟、旗一百多次摔跤冠军时的威风。这四位老摔跤手表演结束后，便脱下他们从十九岁起摔跤时穿用的皮制衣，传给自治区最好的摔跤手僧格、阿迪雅、孟和、额尔汉巴图等四人。他们还按照传统的习惯，同继承他们的技术的年青人紧紧地拥抱。这时全场观众热烈欢呼。
    内蒙古自治区体育运动委员会代表中华人民共和国体育运动委员会，在会上正式授与获得去年全国摔跤锦标赛重量级冠军僧格、次重量级摔跤第二名苏达那木、中量级摔跤第二名义达木、轻量级摔跤第一名其木德四人国家运动健将的称号和金质奖章。参加这次大会赛马、摔跤、射箭和各项比赛的优胜的运动员都得到奖励。敖木拉希在规定的二十、三十、四十公尺距离射箭中，三十发共射中一百六十一环（三百为满环），比去年全国射箭表演赛第一名布和敖其尔的最高纪录多十八环。布和敖其尔在这次比赛中也比他去年创造的全国第一名纪录多四环。
    这次大会还表演了一些古老的民族形式的体育项目。曾经在明朝盛行一时的颇列球（达呼尔族人民的一种体育运动），解放后首次向观众作了表演。颇列球的玩法同冰球相类似，运动员用木棍击打一种内装牛毛的皮球。这个表演引起了观众极大的兴趣。
    到会的观众在三天内达十一万多人次。
