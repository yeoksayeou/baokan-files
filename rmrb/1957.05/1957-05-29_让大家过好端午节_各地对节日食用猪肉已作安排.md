Xinhua News Agency, May 27th: The Dragon Boat Festival is approaching. According to information from relevant departments, various regions have made arrangements for supplying pork for consumption during the festival. Depending on the availability of goods, each person can generally expect to have about half a jin to one jin of pork.

Due to the recent improved acquisition and transportation in major pig-producing areas such as Shandong, Jiangsu, Hunan, Sichuan, and Hubei, various regions have prepared relatively ample supplies. Beijing plans to supply 18,000 pigs, an increase of 37% compared to last year. Tianjin plans to supply 9,500 pigs, an increase of 38% compared to last year. Shanghai's supply volume will not be lower than last year's level. The eleven cities in Liaoning Province, where the pork supply is usually relatively tight, have recently had some pigs transferred in, so it is estimated that each person can also have half a jin of pork during the festival.
