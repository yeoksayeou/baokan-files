    The Italian Government Crisis
    Huang Geng

    The Segni government, which came to power on July 6, 1955, collapsed on May 6. The direct cause of the collapse was the withdrawal of the Social Democratic Party from the government, causing the government to lose its majority in parliament. However, the fundamental reason, like the downfall of previous Italian governments, was that the Segni government was unable to solve major domestic economic and social problems and did not implement a foreign policy in line with the interests of the people, leading to internal divisions within the government coalition as a result of widespread popular dissatisfaction.
    The Segni government was in power for twenty-two months, which is quite a long time compared to the short-lived Italian governments after the war. This is because, under the pressure of the trend towards relaxation in the international situation and the strong demand of the Italian people for a shift to the left, the Segni government was forced to adopt some more enlightened measures, such as: abolishing the reactionary measures of the Scelba government to suppress democratic organizations; announcing compliance with the constitution and establishing a constitutional court; promulgating tax laws to prevent large monopoly capitalists from evading taxes, and passing a petroleum law that to a certain extent safeguarded national interests. The powerful left-wing parties in parliament, the Communist Party and the Socialist Party, supported the Segni government in these activities. However, these measures of the Segni government were not implemented thoroughly and therefore failed to fundamentally solve the serious domestic social and economic problems. The provisions of the constitution regarding "land to the tiller" and the "land expropriation" decree promulgated by the state in 1950 were never implemented due to the obstruction of the Liberal Party and the right wing of the Christian Democratic Party, which represented the interests of large landowners. In the past two years, the number of fully unemployed and semi-unemployed people in Italy has still exceeded four million. The cost of living has continued to rise, while the increase in the wages of workers and agricultural workers has lagged far behind. At the same time, monopoly groups obtained huge profits in 1956, an increase of 31.6% compared to 1955. Orders for the arms industry capitalists to profit from are still increasing. The 1957 defense budget has increased by another 55.7 billion lire compared to last year, which further increases the burden on the vast number of people.
    The reactionary monopoly capitalist groups in Italy are not satisfied with this. Last February, the three monopoly capitalist associations of Italian industry, commerce, and agriculture jointly formed a federation of monopoly capitalist associations in order to exert strong pressure on the Segni government, making it turn further to the right, preventing the implementation of the constitution, and further concentrating the leadership of public affairs in the hands of landowners and large capitalists. Since then, the Segni government has obviously become increasingly reactionary. In the second half of last year, after the Polish and Hungarian events, the reactionary forces launched a large-scale anti-communist movement and massively dismissed progressive workers in military enterprises led by the Ministry of Defense. At the same time, they used the merger issue of the Socialist Party to undermine the unity of the Socialist Party and the Communist Party, in order to crack down on the democratic and progressive forces in Italy, so as to suppress the strong domestic popular movement.
    At the beginning of this year, the Segni government took many reactionary measures, such as: appointing the fascist element and representative of monopoly organizations, Togni, as Minister of State Investment, proposing a land lease reform bill that would give landowners greater rights, and increasing taxes. At the same time, it constantly obstructed the implementation of the democratic principles stipulated in the constitution.
    These measures of the Segni government aroused the dissatisfaction of the vast number of people in Italy. The prestige of the Communist Party among the people has increased anew. This is reflected in the recent local elections. Despite the reactionary forces' efforts to weaken the strength of the Italian Communist Party, the ICP's votes increased in the 212 local elections: for example, it won 25.1% of the votes in Naples, an increase of 3.3% compared to last year, and 36% of the votes in Rimini, an increase of 1.5% compared to last year. The number of votes for the Social Democratic Party decreased. The Socialist Party, which abandoned the agreement for unified action with the Communist Party and swung to the right, also lost a lot of votes. At the same time, the Italian workers' movement is also rising, and in the first five months of this year, strikes have occurred continuously, and the scope is also very wide. Railway workers, tobacco workers, salt workers, employees of semi-state agencies, social relief agencies, postal and telecommunications employees, agricultural workers, etc. have all held strikes one after another. On the same day that Segni resigned, 800,000 construction workers also held a major strike demanding increased wages. The peasant movement is also developing vigorously one after another. Left-wing parties recently launched a struggle day for 4 million farmers to fight for reform of the tenancy system.
    The growth of Italy's progressive forces and the pressure of the vigorous popular movement have placed the Segni government in a serious crisis. In March, when the parliament debated the government's proposed land lease reform bill, which attempted to allow landlords to freely dismiss farmers, it caused fierce struggles between the various parties. The left-wing parties resolutely opposed the bill. The far-right parties opposed it because the bill was not reactionary enough. The Christian Democratic Party and the Social Democratic Party were also divided internally. The trade union faction of the Christian Democratic Party, represented by Pastore, and the left wing of the Social Democratic Party, representing the interests of some peasant masses, dared not express their approval. Thus, those who approved this bill were only the Liberal Party, the right wing of the Christian Democratic Party, and the right wing of the Social Democratic Party. The Segni government had no choice but to temporarily shelve the bill. Segni's appointment of Togni as minister further promoted the contradictions between the various parties in the government coalition in their struggle for power and profit. The Republican Party (which occupies five seats in the lower house) in the four-party coalition saw that the situation was developing unfavorably for the coalition and announced its withdrawal from the coalition, citing the reason that it had never obtained a ministerial position since joining the coalition. This left the Segni government with only a one-vote majority in the lower house, which was already on the verge of collapse.
    The development of the popular movement and the growth of the left-wing forces have also promoted the division within the Social Democratic Party in the government coalition. The masses of Social Democratic Party members have increasingly expressed their dissatisfaction with the Social Democratic Party's continued support of the Segni government's right-leaning policies, and many grassroots members have demanded that the Social Democratic Party withdraw from the unpopular Segni government as soon as possible and merge with the Socialist Party. Social Democratic Party Secretary Matteotti also put forward this proposal. After being opposed by Saragat, he and other members of the Executive Committee resigned together, and threatened to appear as a new "faction" at the party congress. Saragat saw that the situation was not good, so he reversed his past attitude and announced the withdrawal of the Social Democratic Party from the government on May 5. This directly caused the crisis of the Segni government.
    The differences between the Christian Democratic Party and the Liberal Party on foreign policy also played a certain role in prompting the Segni government to fall. Although both parties advocated following the United States, the Christian Democratic Party (especially the left wing) took into account the pressure of the grassroots masses and hoped to maintain more "autonomy" while following the United States, and to have a certain "position" in the Western alliance, which was different to some extent from the Liberal Party's practice of blindly following the United States. As early as the Suez Canal issue, there were disagreements within the Segni government. The Liberal Party, led by Foreign Minister Martino, advocated that Italy follow the United States, but the left wing within the Christian Democratic Party, led by Gronchi, and a part of the business community with economic interests in Africa and Asia, believed that Italy should take an independent position that did not offend Egypt, in order to improve Italy's position and voice in the Mediterranean.
    Martino's attitude on the Suez Canal issue was fiercely criticized by the left wing within the Christian Democratic Party and many influential figures, forming a serious friction between the Christian Democratic Party and the Liberal Party. Martino's recent expression of agreement at the North Atlantic Treaty Council meeting in Bonn that Italy would not participate in the Western committee established to study European security and German unification once again aroused attacks from all factions other than the right wing of the Christian Democratic Party. They believed that the foreign policy pursued by Martino had made Italy lose its "autonomy" in its relations with its Western allies. According to Western newspaper reports, this divergence in foreign policy of the government coalition is an important factor causing the crisis of the Segni government. After Segni resigned, Italian President Gronchi was unable to reconcile the internal contradictions of the alliance and appointed Zoli, a member of parliament of the so-called moderate faction of the Christian Democratic Party, to form a minority government of the Christian Democratic Party in order to maintain it until the next general election and to try to pass the European Common Market Treaty in parliament before the general election. Zoli has put together his team on the 19th. This will be the most unstable government in Italy after the war. The collapse of the Segni government and the failure of activities to organize a new so-called "centrist alliance" government prove that the people's power in Italy is very strong, and their call for the government to change its political course to thoroughly implement the principles of the constitution is stronger than ever before. It is becoming increasingly difficult for the Italian ruling class to disregard their will.

    意大利的政府危机
  　黄赓
    1955年7月6日上台的塞尼政府已于5月6日垮台。垮台的直接原因是社会民主党退出政府，使政府在议会中丧失了多数。但其根本原因，和历届意大利政府的倒台并无不同，是由于塞尼政府无能解决国内重大经济社会问题，并且不执行符合人民利益的外交政策，引起广大人民不满而造成政府联盟内部分裂的结果。
    塞尼政府共执政二十二个月，同战后意大利历届短命政府相比，时间算是相当长的。这是因为在国际局势趋向缓和以及意大利人民要求向左转的强大压力下，塞尼政府曾经被迫采取了一些较开明的措施，如：废除谢尔巴政府镇压民主组织的反动措施；宣布遵守宪法并成立宪法法院；颁布防止大垄断资本家逃税的税收法令以及通过在一定程度上维护了民族利益的石油法案等。议会中的强大的左翼党派共产党和社会党在这些活动上给了塞尼政府以支持。然而塞尼政府的这些措施执行得既不彻底，因此并未能根本解决国内严重的社会、经济问题。关于宪法规定的耕者有其田条款和1950年国家颁布的“征收土地”的法令，在代表大地主利益的自由党人和天主教民主党右派的阻挠下根本未能执行。两年来意大利国内全失业和半失业人数仍然超过四百万。生活指数不断上升，而工人和农业工人的工资的增加却远远落在后面。同时垄断集团在1956年获得了巨额利润，较1955年增加了31.6％。为军火工业资本家从中获取利润的订货还在不断增加。1957年度的国防预算较去年又增加了五百五十七亿里拉，这进一步加重了广大人民的负担。
    意大利的反动垄断资本集团并不以此为满足。去年2月意大利工业、商业、农业的三个垄断资本家协会联合组成了垄断资本家协会联合会，以便对塞尼政府施加强大的压力，使它更向右转，阻止宪法的实现并将公众事务的领导权更进一步地集中于地主和大资本家的手中。自此之后，塞尼政府就明显地日趋反动。去年下半年，波匈事件发生后，反动势力发动大规模的反共运动，并大批解雇国防部领导的军事企业中的进步工人，同时又利用社会党的合并问题，破坏社会党和共产党的团结，这样来打击意大利民主进步力量，以便镇压国内强大的人民运动。
    今年年初，塞尼政府又采取许多反动措施，如：任命法西斯分子、垄断组织的代表托格尼为国家投资部部长，提出给地主更大权利的土地租佃改革法案，增加税收等。同时它不断阻挠宪法规定的民主原则的实施。
    塞尼政府这些措施激起了意大利广大人民的不满。共产党在人民中间的威信有了新的增涨。这表现在最近举行的地方选举中。尽管反动派竭力削弱意共的力量，但是在二百一十二个地方选举中意共的选票却有了增加：如在那不勒斯获选票25.1％，比去年增加3.3％，在利米尼获选票36％，比去年增加1.5％。社会民主党的票数减少了。抛弃了同意共统一行动的公约而向右摆的社会党也失了不少选票。同时，意大利工人运动也日益高涨，今年头五个月中，罢工事件不断发生，范围亦极广，如铁路工人、烟草工人、制盐工人、半国家性质机关职员、社会救济事业机构工作人员、邮电员工、农业工人等都先后举行罢工。就在塞尼辞职的同一天，八十万建筑工人还举行了要求增加工资的大罢工。农民运动也此落彼起，蓬勃发展。左翼党派最近曾发动了四百万农民争取改革租佃制度的斗争日。
    意大利进步力量的增长和蓬勃的人民运动的压力，使塞尼政府面临重重的危机。3月中议会辩论政府提出的企图使地主可以自由解雇农民的土地租佃改革法案时，引起了各党派之间的激烈斗争。左翼党派坚决反对该法案。极右的党派则因为法案还不够反动而反对。天主教民主党和社会民主党内部也陷于分裂。代表一部分农民群众、以巴斯多莱为首的天主教民主党工会派和社会民主党的左派不敢表示赞成。这样，赞成这个法案的只剩下自由党、天主教民主党右派和社会民主党右派。塞尼政府只好将该法案暂时搁置。塞尼委任托格尼为部长的措施更促进了政府联盟各党派之间争权夺利的矛盾。四党联盟中的共和党（在下院占五席）看到形势发展对联盟不利，以自参加联盟以来从未获得一个部长职位为理由，宣布退出联盟。这使塞尼政府在下院只剩一票多数，已经摇摇欲坠了。
    人民运动的发展和左翼力量的增长，也促进了政府联盟中的社会民主党内部的分裂。社会民主党的党员群众对于社会民主党继续支持塞尼政府的右倾政策越来越表示不满，许多基层党员纷纷要求社会民主党尽速退出不得人心的塞尼政府，同社会党合并。社会民主党书记马特奥蒂也提出了这个主张。在遭到萨拉盖特的反对之后，他和执行委员会其他委员一起辞职，并扬言将在党代表大会上以一个新的“派别”出现。萨拉盖特看到不妙，因此一反过去的态度而在5月5日宣布社会民主党退出政府。这就直接造成了塞尼政府的危机。
    天主教民主党和自由党在外交政策上的分歧，在促使塞尼政府倒台方面，也起了一定作用。两党虽然都主张追随美国，但天主教民主党（特别是左派）顾虑到基层群众的压力，希望在追随美国的同时保持较多的“自主”，在西方联盟中有一定的“地位”，这与自由党一味追随美国的作法在程度上有所不同。早在苏伊士运河问题发生时，塞尼政府内部意见便不一致。以外交部长马蒂诺为首的自由党主张意大利跟美国走，但天主教民主党内以格隆基为首的左派以及在亚非地区有经济利益的一部分商界人士则认为意大利应采取一个不得罪埃及的独自的立场，以提高意大利在地中海的地位和发言权。
    马蒂诺在运河问题上采取的态度遭到了天主教民主党内左派以及许多有影响的人物的激烈抨击，形成天主教民主党和自由党之间的严重摩擦。马蒂诺最近在波恩举行的北大西洋公约理事会上表示同意意大利不参加为研究欧洲安全和德国统一而设立的西方委员会一事，再度引起天主教民主党右派以外的各派的攻击。他们认为马蒂诺所奉行的对外政策已使得意大利在与其西方盟国关系中丧失了“自主”。据西方报纸消息，政府联盟在外交政策上的这种分歧，是造成塞尼政府危机的一个重要因素。在塞尼辞职以后，意大利总统格隆基因无法调和联盟内部矛盾，任命天主教民主党的所谓稳健派的议员佐利组织一个天主教民主党的少数派政府，以便维持到下届大选，并谋在大选前使议会通过欧洲共同市场条约。佐利已在19日凑成了他的班底。这将是意大利战后基础最不稳定的一个政府。塞尼政府的垮台和组织一个新的所谓“中派联盟”政府的活动的失败证明，意大利的人民力量非常强大，他们要求政府改变政治方针以彻底实现宪法的原则的呼声比以往任何时候来得更加强烈。意大利统治阶级要不顾他们的意志是愈来愈困难了。
