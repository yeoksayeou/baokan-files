Beijing Agricultural University Professors
Continue to Expose Sectarianism and Bureaucracy

(Our report) On the night of May 14th, professors and associate professors of Beijing Agricultural University continued to expose the errors of sectarianism and bureaucracy in the school's Party organization and administrative leadership at a symposium convened by the school's Party committee. Qi Zhiduo, a female professor in the Mathematics Teaching and Research Group, said to Vice President Shi Ping: "The wall between us was built by both sides. I have thought about it again and again, and I want to be the first to dismantle it. But then I thought, if I have already dismantled a section and the other side has not yet dismantled it, I will put the dismantled bricks back on." She said that she had been at Beijing Agricultural University for several years, and Vice President Shi Ping had also been here for several years, but Vice President Shi's meeting with the professors was like meeting strangers, without even a "nodding acquaintance." Wang Yuhu, a professor in the Department of Agricultural Economics, said that Professor Wu Ting once described the wall between the Party and the masses at the Agricultural University as being as thick as the city wall of Fuxingmen. I would like to add that behind this city wall there is also a "moat." To tear down this wall, Party members should be the first to act.

Luo Zhongyu, an associate professor in the Department of Veterinary Medicine, said that the issue of unity between young and old teachers is essentially also an issue of the relationship between the Party and the masses. He said that if the young and old teachers are all Party members or all the masses, there would be no problem. But if the teaching assistant is a Party member and the old professor is a member of the masses, then there will be problems. The teaching assistant will look down on the professor, and it will be impossible to talk about leadership; there is no relationship of unity, being led and leading between young and old teachers, but rather a relationship of "transformation and being transformed." Luo Zhongyu said that to resolve this contradiction, the first thing to do is to make the old teachers respected and give them some "power," such as the power to choose teaching assistants, the power to offer opinions when assigning graduates, and so on.

Associate Professor Liu Haipeng listed facts and criticized the bureaucracy and sectarianism of the leadership of Beijing Agricultural University. He said that during the wage evaluation last year, the leadership "捧着 (pěngzhe) some people and suppressed some people." I myself was one of those suppressed. This involves the issue of sectarianism. Professor Li Jinghan believes that the sectarianism of Beijing Agricultural University is mainly "failing to distinguish between love and hate." He agrees with the view that some people were suppressed during the wage evaluation. He also cited the fact of sectarianism in the publication of articles in the school's journal. He said that the journal refuses to publish articles by certain people, and the reason is difficult to understand.

"The bureaucracy of Beijing Agricultural University is inseparable from the Ministry of Higher Education." This is the view of Zhang Zhongge, an associate professor in the Department of Animal Husbandry. He said that because the work of Beijing Agricultural University is complex, three presidents were assigned, but some presidents "do not attend to their proper duties" and are busy participating in some diplomatic activities. He said: "Why doesn't the Ministry of Higher Education consider streamlining their activities and stipulating some practical work that they must do?"

Will giving the leadership a lot of opinions actually produce results? This is a question of concern to the people who attended the meeting. Fu Zizhen, director of the translation office, said that in the past, giving the leadership opinions time and time again, the response was "everyone's opinions are basically correct..." and then it was over.

At the end of the symposium, Shi Ping, the Party Secretary and Vice President who chaired the meeting, said: "This rectification will never be carried out behind closed doors. The two-day meeting is part of our rectification. We will continue to ask everyone to help with the rectification. We will continue to rectify until the future work of Beijing Agricultural University has a clear direction, until everyone is satisfied."

### 北京农业大学教授  继续揭发宗派主义官僚主义

    北京农业大学教授
    继续揭发宗派主义官僚主义
    本报讯　14日夜，北京农业大学教授、副教授们在该校中共党委会召集的座谈会上，继续揭发该校党组织和行政领导方面的宗派主义、官僚主义的错误。数学教研组女教授齐植朵面对着施平副校长说：“我们之间的墙是双方搭起来的。我已经想了又想，我要先动手来拆。但是我又想，如果我已经拆了一段而对方还没有拆，我要把拆下的砖再堆上去。”她说，我到北京农业大学已经好几年，施平副校长也已经来了好几年，可是施副校长同教授见面竟如路人，连 “点头关系”都没有。农业经济系教授王毓瑚说，吴亭教授曾形容农大党群之间的这堵墙像复兴门的城墙那样厚，我还要再补充一句，在这堵城墙的后面还有着“护城河”。要拆掉这堵墙党员应该先动手。
    兽医系副教授罗仲愚说，年轻同年老教师间的团结问题，实质上也是党群关系问题。他说，如果年轻和年老教师都是党员或都是群众，就没有问题。如果助教是党员，老教授是群众，那就要出问题。助教就会看不起教授，这样谈领导是不可能的；年轻同年老教师之间不存在团结、被领导与领导的关系，而是“改造与被改造”的关系。罗仲愚说，要解决这个矛盾，首先就得使老教师受到尊敬，给老教师一点“权”，如选择助教之权，分配毕业生时提意见之权，等等。
    刘海蓬副教授列举事实，批评了北京农业大学领导方面的官僚主义和宗派主义。他说，去年评工资时，领导方面是“捧着一部分人，压制着一部分人”。我自己就是被压制的一个。这当中就有宗派主义问题。李静涵教授认为，北京农业大学的宗派主义主要是“爱恶不分”，他同意评工资中有人受到压制的看法。他还举出学校学报刊登文章的宗派主义的事实。他说，学报对某些人的文章是拒绝刊登的，什么原因，很难理解。
   “北京农业大学的官僚主义是同高等教育部分不开的。”这是畜牧系副教授张仲葛的看法。他说，北京农业大学因为工作复杂，给配备了三位校长，但是有的校长“不务正业”，而忙于去参加一些外交性的活动。他说：“高等教育部为什么不考虑精简一下他们的活动，而规定一些他们必需做的实际工作”。
    给领导提了一大堆意见到底会不会得到结果？这是到会的人们关心的问题。翻译室主任傅子祯说，过去给领导提意见一次又一次，得到的反应是“大家的意见基本上是正确的，……”以后就完事了。
    座谈会结束时，主持会议的党委书记施平副校长说：“这次整风绝不关起门来整，两天的会议，就是我们整风的一部分。以后也还要请大家帮助整。我们要一直整到北京农业大学今后的工作有了明确方向为止，整到大家满意为止。”
