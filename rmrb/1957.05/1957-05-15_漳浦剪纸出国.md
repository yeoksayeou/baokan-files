    Zhangpu Paper-cuts Go Abroad
    The Xiamen branch of the China National Native Produce Export Corporation has ordered a batch of paper-cuts from the Zhangzhou and Zhangpu Handicraft Production Cooperatives for export, as these paper-cuts are selling well in Indonesia, Singapore, and surrounding areas.
    The paper-cutting handicraft of women in southern Fujian is exquisite. They can cut various patterns in different seasons and at different times. For example, during the Spring Festival, they cut images to congratulate the New Year; during the Dragon Boat Festival, they cut dragon boat races; during the Mid-Autumn Festival, they cut Chang'e flying to the moon; during the busy spring season, they cut farmers plowing in the fields with cattle, as well as birds and animals, flowers and plants, folk dances, and dramas, all of which are remarkably lifelike.
    Many women in Zhangzhou and Zhangpu are good at paper-cutting, but only a dozen or so in Zhangzhou and four or five in Zhangpu are particularly skilled. They cut three to five pieces each day. These finished products have been exhibited at handicraft exhibitions in Fuzhou and Beijing, and have received high praise from Chinese and foreign people and artists.

    漳浦剪纸出国
    中国土产出口公司厦门分公司曾向漳州、漳浦手工业生产合作社订购一批剪纸出国，因为这些剪纸畅销于印度尼西亚、新加坡一带。
    闽南民间妇女剪纸手工业，技术精巧，她们能在不同季节，不同时间，剪成各种各式花样。如在春节期间剪恭贺新春，端午节剪划龙舟，中秋节剪嫦娥奔月，春忙时剪农民伴随耕牛在田间犁田，以及禽兽花卉、民间舞蹈、戏剧等，真是唯妙唯肖。
    漳州、漳浦民间妇女多善剪纸，但是剪的特别精巧的在漳州仅十余人，漳浦仅四、五人，她们每天每人剪三、五张，这些成品曾在福州、北京的手工业展览会上展览过，得到中外人士、艺术家很高的评价。
