    Editing Recollections
    --About the "World Short Story Collection"	Zhao Jiabi
    Guo Moruo said in a letter dated December 2, 1936:
   "I am invited to be in charge of the
    German section of the 'World Short Story Collection,'
    and I can barely manage it. But I have no
    translated materials at hand, I hope you can
    provide as much as possible,
    and return them after use." Of these five volumes, when the August 13th Incident broke out, the "British Collection" had already selected most of the materials; for the "Japanese Collection," not only had the selection of titles been determined, but even the proofs had been typeset for fifty-four pages.
    The other five volumes are Southern Europe, Northern Europe, Russia, the Soviet Union, and Emerging Countries.
    Apart from Russia, England, France, and Germany, the other parts of Europe are divided into North and South collections. The "Northern European Collection" includes Sweden, Norway, Finland, and Denmark on the Scandinavian Peninsula, and it was agreed that Mr. Yu Dafu would compile it. At that time, he had moved from Hangzhou to Fuzhou. He said in a letter dated March 26, 1937:
   "Please provide as much
    material as possible that has already been
    translated into Chinese,
    because there are no books to buy here. There are few
    countries in Northern Europe, and not many
    writers, and I am afraid that it will not be
    easy to compile 300,000 words of what has been
    translated into Chinese. Also, my reference
    books are all in Hangzhou. I always want to return
    to Zhejiang in May or June
    to bring these books here before I can
    start." After we sent the materials, he wrote again on July 20:
   "I went to Shanghai and Hangzhou in a hurry
    two months ago and brought all my
    books about Northern Europe to Fuzhou.
    When I passed through Shanghai, I didn’t meet
    you because of the time pressure. ...Because I
    haven't seen the advertisement published for a long time, I suspect that this move has been abandoned. How
    many did you sell by reservation? Is there any certainty
    about publishing the book? Please let me know. The national affairs are like this, and my mood is
    extremely bad, I won't write much." Seeing that "the national affairs are like this," he was already worried at that time whether "this move" would be "abandoned." Twenty-three days later, the war broke out, and unfortunately his worries became a reality. Mr. Yu Dafu wandered from Fuzhou during the Anti-Japanese War, and later settled in Nanyang. In 1945, when Liangyou moved to Chongqing, Yu Fei and Yu Feng also planned to have Liangyou reprint Dafu's works; Yu Fei's power of attorney stated: "My father is far away abroad, and there is no news." Who knew that on the day of the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, Mr. Dafu died unjustly under the enemy's guns.
   "Southern European Collection" mainly contains works from Italy and Spain. We invited Mr. Dai Wangshu, who understood the languages of these two countries, to compile it, which everyone thought was very suitable. That year he lived in Shanghai and went all out, making rapid progress. Except for the introduction and appendix, all four hundred and forty pages of paper were typeset, including the selection of eighteen Italian writers with twenty-two articles, and fifteen Spanish writers with nineteen articles, of which Wangshu newly translated ten articles. This collection was originally scheduled to be published as the first book in three months, but unexpectedly this proof was robbed by the war from going to the printing press. Wangshu was injured in the enemy's prison during the Anti-Japanese War. When he returned to Beijing after liberation in 1949, he suffered from severe asthma. When I saw him in Beijing that winter, his health was not as good as before, but he still asked about the whereabouts of this manuscript. When I told him that it was still completely preserved, he smiled and said: "I will find you when there is a chance to publish it in the future." Unexpectedly, he left us in February 1950.
    According to the original plan, the "Emerging Countries" collection, which was prepared to be published as the second book, was compiled by Mr. Lu Yan. At that time, the so-called "emerging countries" mainly included many emerging countries in the Balkan Peninsula after the First World War, that is, the area of today's Eastern European People's Democratic countries and some other new countries. This collection was originally invited to be compiled by Mr. Mao Dun, and he recommended Mr. Ba Jin, Mr. Lu Yan or Mr. Sun Yong to take the job. Later, the former two were invited to be the compilers, but the actual work was done by Lu Yan alone. Before the outbreak of the war, part of the works of this collection had been submitted, including Poland, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Estonia, Lithuania, etc., a total of seventeen people and twenty articles, of which three were newly translated. Unfortunately, Lu Yan died of illness in Guilin during the retreat of the Xiang-Gui War in 1944.

    编辑忆旧
    ——关于世界短篇小说大系	赵家璧
    郭沫若在1936年12月2日来信说：
   “‘世界短篇小说大系’承邀担任
    德国部分，似可勉强为之。但译文
    材料手中毫无搜集，望尽量提供，
    用后退还。”这五卷中，当八·一三战争爆发时，“英国集”已选出了大部材料；“日本集”不但选目已确定，连清样都排了五十四面了。
    此外的五卷是南欧、北欧、俄国、苏联和新兴国。
    除俄、英、法、德外，欧洲其他部分分成南北两集。“北欧集”包括斯堪的纳维亚半岛上的瑞典、挪威和芬兰、丹麦等国，约定郁达夫先生编选。那时他已从杭州迁居福州，他在1937年3月26日来信说：
   “中文译本已出材料，请尽量供给，
    因此地无书可买也。北欧国少，作
    家也不多，而经中文译出者，恐亦
    不易集成三十万字耳。并且我的参
    考书都在杭州，总想于五月或六月
    中回浙一次，将这些书运来，才能
    动手。”我们把材料寄去后，7月20日他又来信说：
   “前两月匆匆去沪杭一转，将关于
    北欧之藏书，全部带来福州，过沪
    时，因时迫未曾面晤。……因久不
    见广告刊出，疑此举已作罢论，究
    竟你们预约卖了多少？出书定有把
    握否？尚祈示知。国事如此，心绪
    极恶，不多书矣。”他鉴于“国事如此”，当时已在担心“此举”是否会“作罢论”，二十三天后，战事爆发，不幸他的杞忧竟成了事实。郁达夫先生在抗战期间自福州辗转流离，以后卜居南洋。1945年良友迁在重庆时，郁飞和郁风两人还打算交良友再印达夫的著作；郁飞的委托书上说：“家父远在国外，音讯不通。”谁知抗战胜利之日，达夫先生却枉死在敌人的枪下。
   “南欧集”以意大利和西班牙作品为主要内容，我们约懂得这两国文字的戴望舒先生编选，是大家认为非常合适的。那年他住在上海，全力以赴，进展很快。除了导言及附录部分外已全部打了四百四十面纸型，内选意大利作家十八人共二十二篇，西班牙作家十五人共十九篇，其中望舒新译的有十篇。这一集原定在三个月后第一本出版，不料这份清样被战争夺去了上印刷机的命运。望舒在抗战时期在敌人的土牢中受过伤，1949年回到解放后的北京时，患着严重的气喘症。那年冬天我到北京见到他时，他的健康已大不如前，但还问起了这部文稿的下落。当我告诉他至今还完整地保存着时，他笑着说：“等将来有机会出版时再去找你吧。”不料1950年2月他就离开了我们。
    按原订计划准备第二本出版的“新兴国”集，是鲁彦先生编选的。当时所谓“新兴国”主要包括第一次大战后巴尔干半岛上的许多新兴国家，也就是今天东欧人民民主国家的地区以及其他一些新国家。这个集子原约茅盾先生编选，他推荐巴金先生、鲁彦先生或孙用先生担任，后来就约前二位担任编选，但实际工作是鲁彦一个人做的。这本集子，战争爆发前作品部分都已交来，计选波兰、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、南斯拉夫、爱沙尼亚、立陶宛等，共十七人二十篇，其中新译的有三篇。可惜鲁彦在1944年湘桂战争撤退时因病死在桂林。
