Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 25th: Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi and Indian Prime Minister Nehru issued a joint communiqué this morning calling for an immediate cessation of atomic and thermonuclear weapon explosion tests.

The joint communiqué stated: "The Prime Minister and the Premier sincerely and urgently call for an immediate cessation of such atomic and thermonuclear explosion tests, and they express their hope that the major powers concerned will reach an agreement on the final abandonment of such tests and the prohibition of all types of atomic and thermonuclear weapons."

The joint communiqué stated: "The Prime Minister and the Premier believe that, as long as there is goodwill and sincerity, any international dispute can be resolved peacefully in accordance with the United Nations Charter and the Ten Principles of the Bandung Resolution. They reaffirmed the determination of the two countries to dedicate themselves to the cause of peace for the benefit of both countries and the world."

The joint communiqué stated that the Japanese Prime Minister assured that Japan would provide full cooperation in the realization of India's Second Five-Year Plan. The Prime Minister and the Premier also generally discussed the issue of economic cooperation and trade development between the two countries.

The joint communiqué mentioned that Prime Minister Nehru had accepted the invitation issued to him by the Japanese Prime Minister to visit Japan, and pointed out that the two countries had exchanged instruments of ratification of the Japan-India Cultural Agreement.

Nobusuke Kishi has concluded his visit to India and departed for Karachi this morning.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 25th: Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi stated at a press conference in New Delhi on May 24th that Japan does not agree with the United States stationing atomic weapons in Japan.

Indian reporters at the conference asked him about Japan's recognition of China. Kishi Nobusuke said that he had tried to explain to Prime Minister Nehru that although Japan hoped to trade with China, "our attitude is that we are unwilling to recognize the communist regime there." He said, we believe that "now is not an appropriate time to consider the issue of China entering the United Nations."

Indian reporters repeatedly questioned the reasons for the Japanese government's adoption of this attitude, and asked him: "Have you ever conducted a public opinion poll on this issue?" "What was your attitude on this issue in the last Japanese election?" He replied, "No public opinion poll was conducted."

According to Kishi Nobusuke, military treaties like the Manila Treaty and the Baghdad Pact "are in accordance with the United Nations Charter." However, he stated: "Japan has no intention of participating in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization."

He said that Japan does not oppose holding a second Bandung Conference, but to hold such a conference, all countries should make full preparations.

    日首相和印总理发表联合公报
    呼吁立即停止原子核武器试验
    岸信介表示不同意美国在日本设置原子武器
    据新华社新德里25日电　日本首相岸信介和印度总理尼赫鲁在今天上午发表联合公报，要求立即停止原子核和热核武器爆炸试验。
    联合公报说：“首相和总理真诚和急切地呼吁立即停止这种原子核和热核爆炸试验，他们表示希望有关大国就最后放弃这种试验和禁止各种类型的原子核和热核武器问题达成协议。”
    联合公报说：“首相和总理相信，只要具有善意和诚意，任何国际纠纷都能按照联合国宪章和万隆决议的十项原则和平解决。他们重申，两国决心为了两国及全世界的利益致力于和平事业。”
    联合公报说，日本首相保证在实现印度第二个五年计划中日本将给以充分的合作。首相和总理还一般地讨论了两国之间的经济合作和贸易发展问题。
    联合公报提到尼赫鲁总理已经接受日本首相向他发出的访问日本的邀请，并且指出两国已经交换了日印文化协定批准书。
    岸信介已经结束对印度的访问，今天上午前往卡拉奇。
    据新华社新德里25日电　日本首相岸信介5月24日在新德里记者招待会上说，日本不同意美国在日本设置原子武器。
    印度记者在会上向他提出了关于日本承认中国的问题。岸信介说，他曾经设法向尼赫鲁总理解释，虽然日本希望同中国贸易，而“我们的态度是，我们不愿承认那里的共产党政权”。他说，我们认为，“目前还不是考虑让中国进入联合国问题的适当时机。”
    印度记者接连追问日本政府采取这种态度的理由，又问他：“你是否曾经就这一问题举行民意测验？”“在上次日本选举中你在这个问题上采取的态度是什么？”他回答说：“没有举行民意测验。”
    据岸信介说，像马尼拉条约和巴格达条约这样的军事条约“是符合联合国宪章的”。不过他表示：“日本无意参加东南亚条约组织。”
    他说，日本不反对举行第二次万隆会议，但是要举行这种会议，各国应当进行充分的准备。
