Xinhua News Agency, May 22nd, Port-au-Prince Dispatch: Haiti's Army Chief of Staff, Léon Cantave, launched a coup d'état on May 21st, overthrowing a provisional government that had just been established on April 6th, and seizing control of Haiti.

Léon Cantave launched the coup because he refused to accept the provisional government's order on May 20th to dismiss him from his post. The reason given for the dismissal was that he had failed to suppress an armed revolt against the provisional government that had occurred not long ago.

For the past six months, the political situation in Haiti has been in a state of flux. Since former President Magloire was forced to step down last December, the regime has changed hands four times. In particular, as the date for the scheduled general election (June 16th) approaches, the domestic situation has become increasingly unstable.

At the same time, the domestic economic situation is also deteriorating. The prices of the main staple foods, rice and beans, have soared by 20% in two weeks. Production has stagnated, and the country's financial situation is facing the danger of collapse.

    海地发生政变
    陆军参谋长推翻临时政府
    新华社22日讯　太子港消息：海地陆军参谋长莱昂·坎塔夫5月21日发动政变，推翻了刚在4月6日成立的一个临时政府，控制了海地。
    莱昂·坎塔夫是因为拒绝接受临时政府在5月20日要把他撤职的命令而发动政变的。撤职的理由是说他没有把不久以前发生的一次反对临时政府的武装暴动镇压下去。
    半年以来，海地政局一直处于动荡不定的状态。自从去年12月前总统马拉罗阿被迫下台后，迄今政权已经更迭了四次。特别是由于预定举行大选的日期（6月16日）日益迫近，国内局势愈趋不稳。
    同时，国内经济情况也日益恶化。主要粮食大米和豆的价格在两星期内猛涨了20％。生产停滞，国家财政情况面临着崩溃的危险。
