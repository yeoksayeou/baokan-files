    The Rhinoceros's Sentinel
    The Indian rhinoceros is a rare giant beast, weighing about two tons, second only to the giant elephant. But its eyesight is poor, and it cannot see clearly at a distance. The egrets that often perch on its back act as its "sentinel." The egrets feed on the ticks on the rhinoceros's body. When the egret detects something suspicious, it quickly takes flight. The large rhinoceros receives the egret's warning and can escape in time.

    犀牛的哨兵
    印度的独角犀牛是稀有的巨兽，体重约达二吨，仅次于巨象。但眼睛近视，看不清楚远处，经常停歇在它背上的白鹭就作了它的“哨兵”。白鹭以犀牛身上的扁虱作为食物。当白鹭发现可疑情况时，就迅速起飞，大犀牛接到白鹭的警告，就能够及时逃避。
