    Random Thoughts
    Xu Gan
    After reading the many remarks made by the First Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee at the symposium at the Arts Theatre, as reported in the May 1st Wenhui Daily, I felt they were very well said. Among them, he said that "the proletariat has no baggage," which is naturally also very true. But some people who already have the title of vanguard of the proletariat, I think, may not be without baggage.
    Here, I am not referring to the fact that these people may also consider themselves meritorious, or have personal plans—usually referred to as historical baggage or ideological baggage, that kind of abstract baggage. I want to talk about another kind.
    It is said that an old factory, last year in response to the call to support new factories, transferred a group of cadres; this year, after inspection, the new factory reported that some of the cadres sent were indeed "old," but this "old" was interpreted literally, meaning they were quite advanced in age; there were cadres suffering from osteomalacia; and there were also cadres who, because of severe lung disease, had to take full leave as soon as they arrived at the new factory. The old factory made a self-criticism, saying that this was a mistaken behavior of "throwing off baggage."
    According to what I saw, a publishing house, last year, received twenty junior high school graduates who were learning and working happily in their traineeships, but behind their backs, some people pointed at them and said: "A big pile of small baggage!" The implication was that they were burdened with these new recruits and couldn't get rid of them.
    It can be seen that these people have baggage, and their baggage is specific and alive. The names of these kinds of baggage are: the elderly, the sick, and the young!

    读5月1日文汇报载上海市委第一书记在艺术剧院座谈会上的许多插话，觉得讲得真好。其中有一段，他说到“无产阶级是没有包袱的”，自然也很对。但有些已有无产阶级的先锋称号的人，我看未必没有包袱。
    我这里不是指这些人也可能有什么功臣自居、个人打算——通常叫作历史包袱、思想包袱那一类抽象的包袱。我要说的是另外一类。
    据说，有一个老厂，去年响应支援新厂的号召，抽调去一批干部；今年检查，新厂反映，其中有老干部，但这个老字作本义解释，就是说年纪着实可观了；有患着软骨病的干部；还有因为肺病严重一到新厂就不得不全休的干部。老厂检讨如仪，说这是一种“扔包袱”的错误行为。
    据看见，有一个出版社，去年来了二十名初中毕业生，他们在见习岗位上边学边做得很欢，背后却有人指着他们说：“一大堆小包袱！”言下大有派到名下，扔它不掉之苦。
    可见，这些人是有包袱的，他们的包袱还是具体的、活的。这类包袱的名字是：老人，病人，年青人！
