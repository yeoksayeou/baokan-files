Old Beijing Sketch

　　Thousands of Households Sharpen Knives and Scissors

　　There’s an old children’s riddle in Beijing: "My family has a tailless donkey. You can't ride it while walking, and you can't walk it while riding." The answer is: "Sharpening knives and scissors." This ancient children’s riddle fully depicts the image of Beijing's knife and scissor sharpeners: a bench with two whetstones at either end, hanging with a water bottle and a tool chest. Isn't the bench a tailless donkey? When sharpening knives and scissors, the sharpener naturally sits on the bench to operate, so the tailless donkey won't move; when not sharpening, the sharpener naturally carries the bench on his shoulder, how can you ride a tailless donkey carried on your shoulder? The craft of sharpening knives and scissors has been obscure since ancient times, but it is closely related to cooking, tailoring, and the past practice of "cosmetic repair." Judging from the term "cosmetic repair" alone, the mirrors used for cosmetic repair in ancient times were made of copper, and when copper mirrors became dull, they needed to be polished. According to "Shi Shuo Bu," Xu Ruzi polished mirrors for people. There are even more writings about "mirror polishers" and "mirror-polishing boys" in Tang Dynasty notes and poems. When I was young, I heard my grandmother say that when she was young, the knife and scissor sharpeners in Beijing also polished copper mirrors. At that time, the cry of the knife and scissor sharpeners was: "Sharpen scissors and knives! Polish copper mirrors!" If we connect these, the mirror polisher is the knife and scissor sharpener, and the knife and scissor sharpener is the mirror polisher. In this way, the craft of sharpening knives and scissors has at least a thousand years of written history.

　　The knife and scissor sharpeners in Beijing truly have their unique skills, their "all the way" diligence, and are truly an indispensable part of people's lives. The knife and scissor sharpeners in Beijing all start as apprentices in their teens. After learning to practice the craft independently, they go to the streets to sharpen knives and scissors. When they reach their fifties—that is, after forty years of sharpening—they have a new apprentice (mostly a nephew or son), in their teens, carrying the bench and following the master to the streets. A knife and scissor sharpener has his familiar routes; you could say he has dedicated customers. Besides wandering these few streets and alleys every day, they don’t go to streets and alleys they haven’t been to, and the customers only call familiar people to sharpen their knives and scissors, not others. Thus, they develop deep feelings over thirty or forty years. Knife and scissor sharpeners can be divided into three categories: one specializes in sharpening knives and scissors for households, one specializes in sharpening knives for restaurants and butcher shops, and one both goes to the streets to sharpen knives and scissors for households and sharpens knives for restaurants and butcher shops. Except for the first category, which must operate during the day, the latter two often sharpen tirelessly, even at night, with their "shileng, shileng" sound. They never take holidays, only resting on days of heavy rain and taking five days off during the Spring Festival. In addition, the busier they are, the more festive it is. After all, isn’t the festival a time to eat good food? To eat good food, you have to sharpen the knife, so they become even busier. Especially in the few days before the Spring Festival, each knife and scissor sharpener has to sharpen more than a hundred knives. Knife and scissor sharpeners all operate outdoors in the streets. Before the Spring Festival, the temperature in Beijing has already dropped to below ten degrees Celsius, but they still brave the wind and snow to sharpen knives for their customers.

　　Knife and scissor sharpeners all recognize famous brands of knives and scissors, such as "Wang Mazi Knives and Scissors," "Yi Zi Knives and Scissors," "Double Ding Zi Knives and Scissors"... They know everything about which brand has good steel and how to sharpen which knife or scissors. They can sharpen any knife or scissors, from large meat cleavers in butcher shops to small pencil sharpeners. Difficult ones, like the old-style mutton shop's "Yangtou style" cutting and boning knives, they can sharpen very quickly. The most difficult, in their words, is what tests their skill: sharpening and repairing scissors. No matter if the scissors are loose, tight, biting, or misaligned, as long as he examines them carefully, he takes out a hammer and anvil from the tool chest and taps a few times, and they are repaired. Strangely, they also use a hammer to hammer scissors that are too tight, but with a different hammering method. When an apprentice follows the master to the streets, he must learn how to sharpen knives and scissors. The repair of scissors, for which they never charge a fee, is also a major course to learn. In addition, the apprentice has to become familiar with the routes and the customers have to recognize the apprentice, so that the apprentice can practice the craft on these streets in the future.

　　Generally, sharpening knives for restaurants and butcher shops is based on long-term customers. You can pick up the knives on a scheduled date. It is different on the streets. Residents don’t have knives and scissors sharpened regularly, so you have to find a way to let customers know that he has arrived at their door. In addition to yelling "Sharpen scissors and knives!" there are also those who blow long horns and those who string together a dozen iron plates and shake them to make a "hua la, hua la" sound. This bundle of iron pieces also has a name, called "startle the ladies." Indeed, "startle the ladies" really played a role in startling the ladies. Women who are cutting clothes feel that the scissors are not aligned, housewives who are cutting vegetables find that the kitchen knife is not sharp. When they hear the "startle the ladies" sound, they take it out for repair and sharpening, and they can immediately work smoothly. The knife and scissor sharpener is very familiar with what kind of knives and scissors each customer's family has. He can also give customers advice. For example, a family brings an old kitchen knife and asks the knife and scissor sharpener: "Do you think this knife can still be used? Should I buy a new knife?" He will frankly tell you: "No need. This is a pure steel knife that is 'return or exchange for chipped edges, but not for rolled edges.' If you sharpen it a bit, you can still use it for a while, no need to buy a new knife." If a family has two knives, and one has never been sharpened by him, he will remind them: "Where's that knife of yours? It can still cut things. Don't use it to chop firewood!" The knife and scissor sharpener develops friendships with customers in this way.

　　The most interesting thing is: didn’t I say above that a knife and scissor sharpener always wanders in a few streets and alleys? A knife and scissor sharpener who sharpens for thousands of households has become an old man after sharpening for forty or fifty years. He has watched the little girls on this street grow into big girls, and he has watched these big girls marry into another street. When he meets her, he will affectionately call her "Madam," he will advise her on what better knives and scissors to buy, and he and his apprentice will continue to sharpen knives and scissors for these "Madams."

### 千门万户磨刀剪

    千门万户磨刀剪	金受申
    北京有个老童谜，谜面是：“我家有个没尾巴驴，骑着它不能走，走着它不能骑。”谜底是：“磨刀剪”。这个古老的儿童谜语，却充分刻画了北京磨刀剪的形象：一条板凳，两头装着两块磨刀石，挂着水壶、家具箱。板凳不是没尾巴驴吗？磨刀剪的时候，磨刀剪人当然要骑着板凳操作，这没尾巴驴就不会走了；不磨刀剪的时候，磨刀剪人当然要扛起板凳来走，这没尾巴驴在人肩头上扛着，还能骑吗？磨刀剪这一行手艺，是自古无闻的，但它对于烹饪、剪裁以及过去的“整容”，都是有密切关系的。单从“整容”这一名词来考究，古代整容照映的镜子，都是铜的，铜镜子不亮了，就需要磨磨。从“世说补”上看，徐孺子就替人磨过镜子，唐人笔记、诗歌里记“磨镜人”、“磨镜少年”的文字，更是不少的。在我小的时候，听老祖母说过：在她们年轻的时候，北京磨刀剪的还磨铜镜子呢。当时，磨刀剪人的吆喝声还是：“磨剪子来磨刀！蹭铜镜子来哟！”如果联系起来：磨镜人就是磨刀剪人，磨刀剪人就是磨镜人，这样，磨刀剪这行手艺，至少也有一千年以上的文字记载了。
    北京的磨刀剪人，确是有他独到的手艺，确是有他“一杆子到底”的勤劳，确是人们生活中不可少的一部分。北京磨刀剪的人，都是从十几岁学徒的，学到能够独立做手艺了，就下街自己磨刀剪；磨到五十多岁——也就是说他已然磨了四十年刀剪，这时候，就又有一个十几岁的徒弟（大部分是子侄），扛着板凳跟着师傅下街了。一个磨刀剪的，都有他走熟了的道路，也可以说都有专门主顾。他们除了每天在这几条街巷转悠以外，没去过的街巷，他们是不去的，而主顾呢，也只叫熟识的人磨刀剪，不叫另外的人磨，这样，三四十年就彼此结了深厚的感情。磨刀剪的，可以分三类，一类是专给家庭住户磨刀剪的，一类是专给饭馆、肉店磨刀的，一类是既下街给住户磨刀剪，又给饭馆、肉店磨刀的，除了第一类必须在日间操作，后两类常常是夜间也哧楞、哧楞的磨个不休。他们从来没有休假，只有下大雨的日子歇工，只有春节歇五天工，另外，越是节日越忙，过节嘛，过节不吃点好的？吃好的就得磨刀，所以他们就更忙起来了。尤其春节前几天，每个磨刀剪的，哪人也要磨光一百多把刀。磨刀剪的都是在街头露天操作的，春节前，北京的温度已然降到零下十几度，他们仍然冒着风雪为主顾磨刀。
    磨刀剪的，全都认识名牌刀剪，像“王麻子刀剪”，“弋字刀剪”，“双丁字刀剪”……哪家钢口好，哪家刀剪怎么磨法，他们可以说是了如指掌。他们是什么刀剪都能磨的，大如猪肉店的劈刀，小如修铅笔刀，难磨的如旧日羊肉店的“扬头式”切、剔两用刀，他们都能磨得飞快。最难的，用他们的话说，这才叫手艺的，就是磨和修理剪子，不用管剪子是口松、口紧，是咬口、不对口，只要他端详好了，从家具箱里拿出铁锤、铁砧子来，?、?几下就修理好了，奇怪的是口紧的剪子也用铁锤来捶，只是另有捶法。徒弟跟师傅下街，当然要学怎样磨刀剪，这向不收修理费的修理剪子，也是要学的一门主要课程。另外，徒弟跟师傅下街，是要徒弟认熟了道，要主顾认识了他的徒弟，以后，这个徒弟才好在这几条街上做手艺。
    一般给饭馆、肉店磨刀，是有长期主顾的，可以按照规定日期去取刀。下街就不然了，住户刀剪没有定期磨的，那么，就得想法子叫主顾知道他到门前了，这样，除吆喝“磨剪子来磨刀！”以外，还有吹长喇叭的，还有把十几个铁板串起来，一抖哗啦、哗啦响的，这一束铁片，也有个名字，叫做“惊闺”。实在，“惊闺”也真起了惊闺作用，正在剪衣服的妇女，感觉剪子不对口了，正在切菜的主妇，发现菜刀不快利了，听见“惊闺”一响，拿出去一修理一磨，立刻就能得心应手。磨刀剪的人，对于哪一个主顾家有什么样刀剪，他是很熟悉的，他也能给主顾出主意，比如有一家拿着旧菜刀问磨刀剪的：“你看，这刀还能用吗？用不用买新刀？”他会直率地告诉你：“不用。这是‘碰口不管，卷口退换’的纯钢刀，磨磨戗戗，还能使些日子呢，不用买新刀。”如果一家有两把刀，有一把总没叫他磨，他会提醒人：“您那把刀呢？还能切东西呢。别拿他劈劈柴呀！”磨刀剪人，就这样和主顾有了交情。
    最有趣的：上面不是说过，一个磨刀剪人总在几条街巷转悠吗？一个千门万户磨刀剪的人，磨了四五十年，也就成了老头子了，他眼看着这条街上的小姑娘长成了大姑娘，他眼看着这个大姑娘嫁到另外一条街上，他遇到她，会亲热地称她为“姑奶奶”，他会指点她买什么更好的刀剪，他和他徒弟，将要会再为这些“姑奶奶”继续磨刀剪。
