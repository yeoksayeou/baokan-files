    Xinhua News Agency, May 23rd, Virtsburg (West Germany) dispatch: West German and Soviet doctors recently cooperated to invent a new method for treating radiation sickness. The basic principle of this medical method was discovered by the West German doctor Schmidt. When he discovered that seaweed in the Bikini Atoll area of the Pacific Ocean—where the United States tested atomic bombs—protected itself by producing a special "degenerative" inflammation, he believed that patients harmed by atomic radiation could be treated by injecting degenerated white blood cells. He submitted his research conclusions to the West German government authorities and medical institutions. However, the West German authorities did not allow him to put this medical method into practice. Soviet medical research institutions expressed great interest in this therapy and conducted clinical experiments. Not long ago, Professor Bogdanov, from the Moscow Institute of Hematology, informed Schmidt that he had used this therapy to cure two hundred radiation patients.

    西德和苏联医生合作
    发明治疗放射病的新方法
    据新华社23日讯　维尔次堡（西德）消息：西德和苏联医生最近合作发明了一种治疗放射病的新方法。这种医疗方法的基本原理是西德医生施密特发现的。当他发现美国试验原子弹的地方——太平洋比基尼岛地区的海藻由于产生了一种特殊的“退化”炎而保护了自己的时候，他认为受到原子放射线危害的病人可以用注射退化的白血球的办法来治疗，并且向西德政府当局和医药机关提出了他的研究结论。但是，西德当局不让他把这种医疗方法付诸实验。苏联的医药研究机构对这种疗法表示了很大的兴趣，并且作了临床实验。不久前，莫斯科血液研究院的波格达桑诺夫教授通知施密特说，他已经采用了这种疗法治愈了两百个放射病人。
