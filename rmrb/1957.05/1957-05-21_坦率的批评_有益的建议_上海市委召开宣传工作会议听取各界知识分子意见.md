Frank Criticism, Beneficial Suggestions
Shanghai Municipal Party Committee Holds Propaganda Work Conference to Hear Opinions from Intellectuals from All Walks of Life
Ke Qingshi Expresses Determination at Closing Meeting
Overcome Shortcomings and Improve Work Through Rectification
(Our newspaper, Shanghai, May 20th) Communist Party members have no interests other than the interests of the people, therefore Communist Party members dare to face their own shortcomings and have the courage to correct them. We are not afraid of mistakes, we can correct them. This was stated by Ke Qingshi, First Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, at the closing meeting of the Shanghai Municipal Committee Propaganda Work Conference today.

The Shanghai Municipal Committee Propaganda Work Conference, which began on the 11th of this month, closed today after eight days. The conference implemented the spirit of bold "letting go" and "contending", and widely listened to criticisms and suggestions from non-Party members on various aspects of the Party's work.

Ke Qingshi said: The vast majority of the speeches at this meeting were sincere and sharp. Many representatives, out of love for our Party, put forward valuable opinions with analysis and research, which is very worthy of gratitude. He said: Some of the errors and shortcomings in the Party's work that the representatives exposed are being corrected, and some involve various systems and need to be studied before improvement plans can be proposed. He said: Of course, there are some opinions expressed at the meeting that we cannot agree with, but these opinions are also helpful for our research. Ke Qingshi then talked about the purpose and method of rectification. He said that Communists should improve their ideological awareness and improve their work through rectification, so that our thinking and working methods adapt to the new situation. Many new problems have emerged during the period of socialist construction, we have no experience, and many tasks must be learned from scratch. As long as we put down our airs, learn honestly, and integrate with the workers and peasants, we will definitely be able to learn. He said that the relationship between the Party and the workers and peasants is inseparable like flesh and blood. Whether a Communist Party member has a Marxist-Leninist worldview depends on whether he can integrate with the workers and peasants. He particularly emphasized the need to use correct methods to oppose bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism. Bureaucracy must never be used to oppose bureaucracy, sectarianism to oppose sectarianism, or revisionism to oppose dogmatism. And we must adopt the method of gentle breeze and fine rain, hold small meetings and heart-to-heart talks to solve ideological problems. Some people say that gentle breeze and fine rain cannot solve problems, but in fact, this is the only method that can truly solve ideological problems. Ke Qingshi concluded by saying: This meeting has given us great training. We must correct the shortcomings and errors in our past work, so that the various correct policies of the Central Committee can be implemented, and the Party and the six million people of Shanghai can unite even better.

At today's meeting, Shi Ximin, Minister of Propaganda of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, and Liu Jiping, Minister of Education and Health of the Municipal Party Committee, responded based on the representatives' speeches in the past few days. For example, if publishing houses that had achievements in the past are now willing to resume operation, the Party will help them resume. If some publishing houses that were merged incorrectly after liberation are now willing to separate, the Party will also provide assistance. If a theatrical troupe that was nationalized during the socialist high tide last year proposes to remove the "nationalized" label, we will also agree. In order to better help scientific workers carry out their work, the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee is considering establishing a Science Work Committee, and is also preparing to select several key universities to pilot the method of school committees and college committees. Shi Ximin also put forward specific opinions on improving the theoretical study of cadres and intellectuals in the future and improving news interviewing. He reviewed that he had not led in accordance with the characteristics of culture and art in the past. He suggested that art troupes be changed to collective ownership, with actors freely combining, and abolishing all unreasonable systems.

About half of the more than 2,000 representatives attending and attending the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Work Conference were representatives of Shanghai's democratic parties and non-Party intellectuals. Eighty-six representatives spoke at the conference. In addition, the conference also received more than one hundred written opinions, all of which will be published in Shanghai newspapers. The vast majority of these opinions come from non-Party people from all walks of life.

(Our newspaper, Shanghai, May 20th) The majestic Sino-Soviet Friendship Building in Shanghai has spent an extraordinary period in mid-May, when spring is rich. Nearly 2,000 Party and non-Party cadres and intellectuals representatives from Shanghai, together with all members of the Secretariat of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, held the Shanghai Municipal Committee Propaganda Work Conference here. Some people call this contention about contradictions among the people "spring" or "thawing."

In recent days, the reporter has witnessed old scientists who have been immersed in research rooms all year round, old hospital directors in their fifties, energetic factory engineers... coming to the podium one after another, and their sense of responsibility to the Party and the people's cause shines on their faces.

Determined to Expose Contradictions, Confident to Overcome Contradictions
Zhou Gucheng, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, who was the first to speak at the conference, said as soon as he came up: I am very honored to be able to participate in the Propaganda Work Conference of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China as a member of a democratic party. It is rare in the history of China and the world for the Communist Party to hold its own meeting, invite non-Party members to speak, and make suggestions. It cannot be taken lightly. It powerfully refutes the enemy's slander and insults. The enemy often slanders and says: "The Communist Party does not give people freedom and does not allow people to have the opportunity for individual development." Now the Communist Party invites non-Party members to participate in its own meeting and listen to their opinions, which not only refutes the enemy's slander, but also encourages the people's enthusiasm for building socialism.

The conference itself does embody this point. Many non-Party friends' criticisms of the Party's work are sharp and fierce, and some even shout loudly, but most of the speeches embody this point: confidence and strength. People are not discouraged or lose confidence because of this. Since people are determined to expose contradictions, this shows that people have infinite confidence and strength to overcome contradictions, which is precisely a sign of the advancement of the cause. Translator Li Lan said at the conference that the current "letting go" and "contending" approach adopted by the Party "marks a prelude to a leap forward in our great socialist cause."

Sincere Words, Earnest Tone
Many representatives' speeches were so sincere and earnest, and they truly started from loving the Party and caring for the Party, and put forward sharp and earnest criticisms of the Party's work, which was very touching. The speech by Huang Minglong, a researcher at the Shanghai Institute of Organic Chemistry of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, is an example. He began by saying: "The Communist Party of China, in terms of its achievements, can undoubtedly be said to be great, glorious, and correct. It has improved our international status, reformed our country's evil politics and society, and eliminated the evil elements of exploitation, corruption, deception, and oppression in the country. If we think about the despicable and cruel situation in Shanghai before liberation, or just take the matter of eliminating poisonous opium, we can assert that the Communist Party of China has indeed made countless contributions to the people." He also said that the reason why he wanted to explain this first was so that "today's listeners will regard my suggestions and criticisms of the Party as the loving affection between brothers and sisters," and "if there is a point that is correct, I hope it will be accepted." Then, he strictly criticized some of the shortcomings of the Party organization in his unit, such as not following the mass line, not relying on the masses, overemphasizing the aspect of organizational discipline for Party members, lacking a democratic atmosphere and democratic habits, and neglecting the care for these Party members' personal interests and health. He said painfully: "Many young Party members who work with me in research and whom I know in the institute, I feel that they are all loyal and honest, on the one hand they are eager to learn, on the other hand they are striving to serve the people, which is indeed different from the past (some new Kuomintang members were all opportunists, corrupt and treacherous, and monsters), but they feel extremely depressed about the deviations in the leadership of the institute, the waste of talent, the waste of their time, and the fact that academic progress has not been made in recent years, but instead they have forgotten what they learned in school, and even cry behind their backs, but dare not raise objections to the organization. If it is like this within the Party, one can imagine what it is like outside the Party. If Party members' opinions cannot reach the top, how can we rely on the masses."

Criticism to Enhance Unity, Seek Truth from Facts to Handle Contradictions
This spirit of criticism starting from loving the Party and enhancing unity can also be heard in the speeches of many representatives. Zhao Zukang, a representative of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, believes in his speech that this criticism of the Party's shortcomings is not only a matter for the Communist Party, but also a profound education for the broad masses of the people. He said: "Bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism in fact exist not only within the Communist Party, but also among non-Party intellectuals. Therefore, I realize that the rectification of this atmosphere is not only a matter for the Party, but also a matter for all leaders and working cadres in organs, schools, and enterprises across the country. It is a major event of changing customs and habits on a national scale that has never happened in ancient or modern times, at home or abroad." We believe that "when criticizing, we must implement the spirit of the formula 'unity - criticism - unity'. In this way, we will not only help the Communist Party, but also learn the Party's rectification principles and methods, improve ourselves in the movement, transform ourselves, and make all of us unite more closely under the leadership of the Communist Party and work together to build socialism." Peng Wenying, a member of the Standing Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and Deputy Chairman of the Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, who spoke on the same day as Zhao Zukang, talked about the one-sidedness in propaganda work in this connection. He said: Propaganda work should often use "gentle breeze and fine rain", and also "spring breeze and rain", and avoid bursts of gales, typhoons, and tornadoes. He pointed out that newspapers only saw achievements and not shortcomings some time ago, and now it is a "world of contradictions", full of shortcomings, and achievements have disappeared. Such reporting is not comprehensive or truthful. Qi Qisheng of Fudan University believes that everyone should work together to handle various contradictions in a practical and realistic manner, and not use extreme liberalism to oppose bureaucracy, revisionism to oppose subjectivism, or sectarianism to oppose sectarianism, so as to tear down the current "wall" and build a new "wall".

Sharp Criticism, A Rich Lesson
For the hundreds of Communist Party members who participated in the conference, these days of the propaganda conference were truly a rich and profound lesson. Sharp criticisms and accusations, a large number of shocking facts, people's passionate appeals... powerfully made people feel the urgency of the new situation. One Communist Party member said: "Participating in the meeting for a few days, I was both excited and nervous every day, and I couldn't sleep when I went back. I deeply felt the weight of the responsibility on my shoulders." During the days of the meeting, the attendance rate of Party members remained high, and Communist Party members outside the meeting also generally read and discussed the reports on the meeting. The criticisms from outside the Party did not frustrate the courage of the Communists, but instead inspired their ambition even more. Recently, the Shanghai Municipal Committee has compiled all the criticisms from non-Party people from all walks of life at the preparatory meeting of the propaganda conference and sent them to the Party organizations of various relevant organs and enterprises for verification and inspection, and immediately solved some problems that could be solved. The various criticisms and suggestions put forward at this conference have also been assigned to special personnel for sorting out. The convening of the Shanghai Municipal Propaganda Conference and the unprecedentedly active democratic atmosphere in Shanghai society have formed a huge driving force that will enable the Party's rectification movement in Shanghai to be carried out in depth.

### 坦率的批评　有益的建议 上海市委召开宣传工作会议听取各界知识分子意见

    坦率的批评　有益的建议
    上海市委召开宣传工作会议听取各界知识分子意见
    柯庆施在闭幕会议上表示决心
    通过整风克服缺点改进工作
    本报上海20日电　我们共产党员除了人民的利益以外，没有别的任何利益，因此共产党员敢于面对自己的缺点，也有勇气改正自己的缺点。我们不怕错误，我们能够改正错误。这是中共上海市委第一书记柯庆施在今天闭幕的上海市委宣传工作会议上说的。
    从本月11日开始的上海市委宣传工作会议，在历时八天之后，于今天闭幕。这次会议贯彻了大胆“放”和“鸣”的精神，广泛地听取了党外人士对党的各种工作的批评和建议。
    柯庆施说：这次会上绝大部分的发言，诚恳尖锐。不少的代表从爱护我们党出发，有分析、有研究地提出了宝贵的意见，这一点非常值得感谢。他说：代表们所揭发出来的党的工作中的一些错误和缺点，有的正在改正，有的牵扯到各方面的制度，要等到研究之后，才可以提出改进方案。他说：当然会议上也有一部分意见是我们不能同意的，但这些意见对我们研究问题也有帮助。柯庆施接着谈到了整风的目的和方法，他说，共产党人要通过整风来提高思想觉悟，改进工作，使我们的思想和工作方法适应新的形势。社会主义建设时期中出现了许多新问题，我们没有经验，许多工作都要从头学起。只要我们放下架子，老老实实学习，和工人农民打成一片，就一定可以学会。他说，党和工人农民的关系，如同血肉不可分离。考验共产党员是否有马列主义世界观，就看他能否和工人农民打成一片。他特别强调指出要用正确的方法反对官僚主义、宗派主义、主观主义。决不能用官僚主义反对官僚主义，用宗派主义反对宗派主义，用修正主义反对教条主义。而且必须采用和风细雨的办法，开小会谈心，解决思想问题。有人说和风细雨解决不了问题，实际上真正能解决思想问题的只有这个方法。柯庆施最后说：这次会议给了我们很大的锻炼，我们一定要改正过去工作中的缺点和错误，使中央的各项正确政策得到贯彻执行，使党和六百万上海人民团结得更好。
    今天会上，中共上海市委宣传部长石西民、市委教育卫生工作部部长刘季平，根据几天来代表们的发言，作了答复。例如过去工作有成绩的出版社如果现在愿意恢复，党将帮助他们恢复。解放后若干出版社合并错了的，现在愿意分开，党也将给予帮助。在去年社会主义高潮中实行了国营的剧团，有人提出要脱掉国营的帽子，我们也同意。为了更好帮助科学工作者进行工作，上海市委已在考虑成立科学工作委员会，此外还准备选择若干高等学校重点试行校委会和院委会的办法。关于改进今后干部和知识分子的理论学习和改进新闻采访问题，石西民也提出了具体意见。他检讨过去没有按照文化艺术的特点来进行领导，他建议艺术团体改为集体所有制，演员自由结合，废除一切不合理的制度。
    出席和列席这次上海市委宣传工作会议的两千多代表中，约有一半是上海各民主党派和党外知识分子的代表，有八十六个代表在大会上发言。此外大会还收到书面意见一百余件，都将如数在上海报纸上发表，这些意见绝大部分来自党外各界人士。
    本报上海20日电　上海巍峨的中苏友好大厦，在春意浓郁的5月中旬，度过了一段不平凡的日子。上海近两千名党内外干部和知识分子代表，和中共上海市委书记处的全体成员一起，在这里举行了上海市委的宣传工作会议。有人把这次关于人民内部矛盾的争鸣叫做“春天”或“解冻”。
    几天来，记者目击着终年埋头于研究室的老科学家，年过半百的医院老院长、精力旺盛的工厂工程师，……一个又一个地来到讲坛上，对党对人民事业的责任感，闪耀在他们的脸上。
    有决心揭露矛盾  有信心克服矛盾
    大会第一个发言的中国农工民主党上海市委主任委员周谷城，一走上来就说：我能以一个民主党派成员的身份参加中国共产党上海市委员会宣传工作会议，感到非常荣幸。共产党自己开会，请党外人参加发言，并提意见，这是中国和世界历史上少有的事情，不可等闲视之。它有力地回击了敌人的谰言和侮蔑。敌人常侮蔑说：“共产党不给人民自由，不让人民有个性发展的机会。”现在共产党却请党外人参加自己的会议，听取他们的意见，这不但回击了敌人的谰言，反过来也鼓舞了人民建设社会主义的积极性。
    这次会议的本身，确实体现着这一点，许多党外朋友对党的工作的批评是尖锐的，激烈的，有的甚至大声疾呼，但是大部分的发言中都体现着这一点：信心和力量，人们并不因此而沮丧，丧失信心，人们既然决心揭露矛盾，这就表明了人们有无限的信心和力量来克服矛盾，这正是表明了事业的前进。翻译家李兰在大会上说，党目前所采取的“放”与“鸣”的做法，“是标志着我国伟大的社会主义事业上将有飞跃发展的一个前奏曲。”
    情辞恳切　语重心长
    不少代表的发言都是那样情辞恳切，语重心长，他们真正从爱护党，关怀党出发，对党的工作提出尖锐而恳切的批评，听了很使人感动。中国科学院上海有机化学研究所研究员黄鸣龙的发言就是一个例子。他一开始即说：“中国共产党照其成绩来讲，毫无异议地可以说是伟大、光荣、正确，它提高了我们的国际地位，改革了我国万恶的政治社会，肃清了国内剥削贪污欺骗压榨的恶劣分子。我们想想解放前上海的卑鄙残酷情况或者就拿消灭毒人的鸦片烟一事来说就可以断言，中国共产党造福于人民的功绩确实是不可胜数。”他又说，他所以要首先说明这一点，是为了“今天的听众将我对党的建议与批评认为是兄弟姐妹间爱好的情意”，“有一分对，便可望被接受一分”。接着，他便严格地批评了他所在单位党组织的一些缺点，如不走群众路线，不依靠群众，对党员过分地强调组织纪律的一面，缺乏民主空气和民主习惯，忽略了对这些党员个人志趣和身体健康的照顾。他沉痛地说：“跟我做研究工作的以及我在院中认识的青年党员很多，我觉得他们都是忠诚老实，一方面是好学不倦，一方面又竭力为人民服务，这确与从前不同（若干新入国民党的党员都是投机取巧、贪污奸诈、牛鬼邪神的分子），但是他们对院中领导上的偏差，浪费人才，浪费他们的时间，几年来学术不能前进反而把学校里所学的忘却得干干净净，当然感觉到极大沉闷，甚至背后哭泣，但是不敢向组织提出异议。党内如此，党外可知，党员的意见都不敢上达，这如何可以依靠群众。”
    批评为了增强团结  实事求是处理矛盾
    这种从爱护党、从增强团结出发的批评精神，还可以从许多代表的发言中听到。民革上海市委代表赵祖康在发言中认为，这次对于党的缺点的批评不只是共产党一方面的事，同样也是对于广大人民的一次深刻教育，他说：“官僚主义、宗派主义、主观主义事实上不仅是在中共党内存在着，在党外知识分子中间同样存在着。因此，我体会到这一个风气的整顿，不仅仅是党内的事情，也是全国在机关、学校、企业内领导与工作干部大家的事情，是中外古今从未有过的全国规模移风易俗的一件天大的事情。”我们认为：“在批评的时候，必须贯彻‘团结——批评——团结’的公式的精神，这样，不但帮助了共产党，而且也可以学习了党的整风的方针方法，在运动中提高自己，改造自己，使我们大家在共产党的领导下，更紧密地团结起来，共同为建设社会主义而努力。”和赵祖康同一天发言的上海市政协常委、民盟市委副主任委员彭文应，由此联系谈到了宣传工作中的片面性，他说：宣传工作应该经常用“和风细雨”，还应该用“春风化雨”，要避免一阵又一阵的狂风、台风、龙卷风。他指出报纸前些时只见成绩不见缺点，目前又是“矛盾世界”，满纸缺点，成绩跑光了，这样报道是不全面、不真实的。复旦大学漆琪生认为大家要共同努力，实事求是地处理各种矛盾，不要以极端自由主义来反对官僚主义，以修正主义来反对主观主义，以宗派主义来反对宗派主义，以致拆掉了现在的“墙”又筑起新的“墙”。
    尖锐的批评　丰富的一课
    对于参加会议的几百个共产党员来说，这几天来的宣传会议，真是丰富而深刻的一课。尖锐的批评和责备，大量惊心动魄的事实，人们满怀激情的呼吁，……以巨大的力量使人感受到新的形势的逼人，有一个共产党员说：“参加会议几天来，每天都是又激动、又紧张，回去睡不着觉，深深感到肩上责任的重大。”会议几天中，党员的出席率始终很高，会外的共产党员也普遍地阅读和讨论着有关会议的报道，党外的批评不是挫折了共产党人的勇气，而是更加激励了他们的进取心。最近上海市委已将宣传会议预备会议上各阶层党外人士的批评，全部整理出来，发给各有关机关、企业的党组织，进行核对和检查，并立即解决一些可能解决的问题。这次会议上提出的各种批评和建议，也已经指派专人进行整理工作。上海市宣传会议的召开，上海社会上民主空气的空前活跃，已形成了一个巨大的推动力量，将使上海市党的整风运动深入开展。
