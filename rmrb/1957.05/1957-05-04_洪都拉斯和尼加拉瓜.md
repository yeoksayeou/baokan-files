Honduras and Nicaragua are neighboring countries located in Central America. They are both member states of the "Organization of American States" controlled by the United States.

　　The Republic of Honduras has an area of over 112,000 square kilometers and a population of over 1.6 million. It became a Spanish colony in the early 16th century; it broke away from Spain in 1821, joined the Central American Federation in 1823, and established a republic in 1838. However, American forces then invaded and controlled Honduras economically and politically. The "United Fruit Company" of the American "Boston Consortium" and other companies monopolize the economic lifeline of Honduras and manipulate Honduras's internal and external affairs.

　　The Republic of Nicaragua has an area of 148,000 square kilometers. The population is over 1.2 million. It became a Spanish colony in 1524, broke away from Spain in 1821, became a member of the Central American Federation, and established a republic in 1939. Nicaragua, like Honduras, became a target of American aggression. In 1911 and 1916, the United States successively coerced Nicaragua into signing unequal treaties, seizing tariff rights, canal excavation rights, and privileges to establish naval bases. Since then, Nicaragua's economic and political lifeline has become increasingly bound and dominated by the United States.

　　The people of Honduras and Nicaragua have waged unyielding struggles against American imperialism. The people of Nicaragua once wrote a glorious and moving page in the revolutionary history of the Latin American people with their blood. From 1926 to 1933, the Nicaraguan people launched guerrilla warfare under the leadership of national hero Sandino, continuously achieving victories and finally forcing the American interventionist troops to withdraw from Nicaragua in 1933. However, the United States continues to control Nicaragua by constantly creating despicable coups.

　　Recently, border incidents have been constantly occurring between Honduras and Nicaragua, and war has now broken out. The United States is attempting to use this conflict to intensify its control over them. (Lu Ying)

    洪都拉斯和尼加拉瓜
    洪都拉斯和尼加拉瓜是位于中美洲的毗邻国家。它们都是美国控制下的“美洲国家组织”的成员国。
    洪都拉斯共和国面积十一万二千多平方公里，人口一百六十多万人。它于十六世纪初期沦为西班牙殖民地；1821年脱离西班牙，1823年参加中美洲联盟，1838年建立了共和国。但美国势力继而侵入，在经济和政治上控制了洪都拉斯。美国“波士顿财团”的“联合水果公司”和其他公司垄断着洪都拉斯的经济命脉，并操纵洪都拉斯的内政外交。
    尼加拉瓜共和国面积十四万八千平方公里。人口一百二十多万人。它于1524年沦为西班牙殖民地，1821年脱离西班牙，成为中美洲联盟的一员，1939年建立共和国。尼加拉瓜同洪都拉斯一样成为美国侵略的目标。1911和1916年，美国先后胁迫尼加拉瓜签订不平等条约，攫取关税权、运河开凿权以及建立海军基地的特权。自此以后，尼加拉瓜的经济和政治命脉就一天天地愈益陷入美国的束缚和支配之下。
    洪都拉斯和尼加拉瓜人民都曾对美帝国主义展开了不屈的斗争。尼加拉瓜人民曾以鲜血写下了拉丁美洲人民革命历史的光荣的可歌可泣的一页。1926到1933年尼加拉瓜人民在民族英雄桑地诺领导下发动游击战争，不断取得胜利，终于在1933年迫使美国干涉军撤离尼加拉瓜。但美国不断制造卑鄙的政变，继续控制尼加拉瓜。
    近来，洪都拉斯和尼加拉瓜之间不断发生边境事件，现已爆发了战争。美国正企图利用这一冲突事件，加紧对它们的控制。（鲁映）
