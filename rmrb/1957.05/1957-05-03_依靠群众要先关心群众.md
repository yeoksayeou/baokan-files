To Rely on the Masses, First Care for the Masses
By our reporter Zhang Wei

Liang Yanbin is the Party Branch Secretary of the Xiangfan Cotton Textile Factory in Hubei Province. She is a person who is very concerned about the lives of the masses and attaches importance to political work. She was once commended by the Hubei Provincial Party Committee at the Hubei Provincial Industrial Political Work Conference. I asked her to talk about her work, and below is her account.

Our factory implemented joint state-private ownership last year. There are more than 300 people in the factory, who live very scattered and the situation is relatively complex. To run the enterprise well, it is very important to rely on the masses; to rely on the masses, we must first care for the thoughts and lives of the workers. This is our work experience.

To Dismiss the Family Members of Temporary Workers
First Explain the Rationale, Then Find a Way Out

In January of this year, more than a dozen workers from the Xiangfan Cigarette Factory were transferred to our factory. Our factory's production volume is limited. To arrange for this group of workers, we had to let the original twenty-three family members who rotated as temporary workers in the factory leave. We estimated that this might cause dissatisfaction among the family members and some workers. Therefore, we convened a Party branch meeting in advance to study. We analyzed the demands of the family members, mainly: participating in labor provides a certain income, which can subsidize the family. We planned to organize the twenty-three family members to wash clothes and sew socks for all the factory workers, estimating that the income would not be small. Everyone divided the work at the meeting and explained to the family members and workers separately after the meeting. Sure enough, as expected, after the news that cigarette factory workers were coming and family members were leaving spread, there were many opinions from the masses. On the one hand, we patiently explained to the workers and family members that if the family members did not leave, the worker brothers from the cigarette factory would lose their jobs and their family lives would be more difficult. Moreover, after the family members left, they would still have income from participating in laundry work. On the other hand, I first organized Wei Jianfeng, Wang Jinrong, and Gui Dehua, three family members with the most difficult family lives, to wash clothes for the workers. When the other twenty or so family members saw this, they felt that the income from washing clothes was not bad, so they all came to ask to join the laundry group. Now all twenty-three family members have been organized. They are divided into groups to wash clothes, dismantle quilts, and sometimes sew socks, lock buttonholes, and make shoe soles for the workers in each workshop. The mood of the family members has stabilized, and the mood of the workers has also stabilized.

If the Cafeteria is Not Well-Run, it Affects the Workers' Health
Leading Cadres Personally Take Charge of Meals

Last summer, Party members reflected the workers' opinions on the cafeteria at group meetings: The workers in the Third Workshop said that the cafeteria had six uncleanlinesses: the steamer was unclean, the cutting board was unclean, the rag was unclean, the brush was unclean, the stove was unclean, and the ground was unclean. The cooks used steamer water to make steamed buns, and they also used steamer water to stir the noodle soup. After the workers drank it, everyone had diarrhea. There were often ants and mosquitoes in the steamed buns. The cafeterias in other workshops mostly had thin rice, small buns, and tasteless dishes.

After the Party group leader reported the situation to the branch, the branch felt that the problem was serious and immediately convened a branch meeting, deciding to rectify the cafeteria immediately. I, along with the factory director and the chairman of the trade union, inspected the cafeterias in each workshop, educated the cooks, and proposed that each cafeteria launch a competition, first comparing who made the best steamed buns. We mobilized Zhao Yongxian, an advanced cook in the First Workshop, to set an example.

Then, we used the advanced cooks to propose competitions in cleanliness, quality, and low prices, ensuring that workers could eat their fill, eat well, and save money. In this work, we focused on helping the cafeteria in the Third Workshop, which had the most complaints from the workers. When rectifying the cafeteria in the First Workshop, the chairman of the trade union and I went to the cafeteria to study the reasons for the poor food and ways to improve it. We even made a meal ourselves for the cooks to see. As a result, the food in this cafeteria improved. Now, to rectify the cafeteria in the Third Workshop, I told Lu Yuanbing, the food committee member of the Third Workshop, about our past practices. That day, he also went to buy vegetables himself, and then steamed buns, stir-fried dishes, and made soup, carefully making a day's worth of food. He cleaned the kitchen utensils and made the dishes diverse, beautiful, and delicious. The workers were very satisfied. After being educated by the facts, the cook Li Wanfu quickly washed the cutting board and steamer clean, plugged the ant holes in the kitchen, and refreshed the stove with lime powder. The dishes were also made more delicious. The cafeterias in other workshops also learned from this cafeteria's example and improved their meals.

Cadres Help Workers Sun Bedding and Catch Bedbugs
A Cleanliness and Hygiene Competition Was Launched Throughout the Factory

Also last summer, I saw that the workers all had many red spots on their backs. Not knowing the reason for this, we went to inspect the workers' collective dormitories and found bedbugs, full and fat, crowded in the cracks of the beds. The dormitories were littered with peanut shells and watermelon rinds, and flies and mosquitoes were flying around as soon as people moved. The ropes were covered with dirty clothes.

If the cleanliness and hygiene of the workers' dormitories are not improved, it will affect the workers' health. We took advantage of the workers being away from the dormitories and mobilized cadres to help the workers sun their bedding, catch bedbugs, spray DDT, and sweep the floor. There were many young people in the Third Workshop, who were more particular about cleanliness, so we focused on the Third Workshop and launched a hygiene campaign. The workers rearranged their beds, washed the quilts that needed washing, spread the beds neatly, pasted white paper on the walls, and even put up some nice pictures. They also wiped the looms in the workshop so that they shone brightly. We organized workers from each workshop to visit the dormitory of the Third Workshop, and also made a red flag, organizing the dormitories of each workshop to launch a cleanliness and hygiene competition. The cleanliness and hygiene work in each workshop has been carried out. Now, the workers' sickness rate has been greatly reduced, and the factory's monthly medical expenses have also been reduced from about one hundred yuan to about twenty yuan.

Find Out Why Workers are Feeling Down
Help Solve the Problem of Children Transferring Schools

Our factory is in Fancheng, Xiangfan City, but the workers in the Fifth Workshop live in Xiangyang, across the river. These workers were very eager to move over here to live. Later, the factory had housing, and the workers in the Fifth Workshop moved over. However, we found that the workers who moved over were not in high spirits.

Sometimes, they talked in twos and threes, and walked away when they saw us. What was the reason? When we asked, they didn't say. We immediately convened a meeting of the production committee, the trade union chairman, etc., but they couldn't explain the reason either. I asked, "According to your estimation, what is the reason?" They said, "They moved here themselves, but their children can't transfer schools, and there is no place to live here, so they have to leave their children in Xiangyang. No one takes care of the children there. That's probably it!" We convened a workers' meeting and criticized our own negligence in our work at the meeting. I said, "We will immediately help your children transfer schools and move the children over here as well. Those with children will live downstairs, and those without children will live upstairs. Everyone squeeze together. If you have any other opinions, feel free to bring them up, and we will study and solve them together." After hearing this, the workers' faces relaxed, and they spoke their minds one after another. After the meeting, we cadres divided the work, some handled the children's school transfer matters, and some went to the workers' dormitories to help nail windows, repair stairs, etc. ... We solved all the problems that could be solved.

In addition, we often visit the workers' families, discover and solve problems, such as disharmony between husband and wife, family members not knowing how to manage their lives, etc. If employees have major illnesses or special difficulties, our leading cadres show even more care and consideration for them.

Leading Cadres Live with the Workers
Constantly Study the Opinions Raised by the Employees

We have so few cadres in our factory, how can we keep abreast of the ideological situation and small problems in the lives of more than 300 employees at any time? Our method is to rely on everyone to do it. We often convene Party and Youth League member meetings to study the problems raised by employees, mobilizing every Party member, every Youth League member, every activist, and even mobilizing every worker, to do ideological work and help others solve problems. In addition, we are always with the workers in normal times. I often eat in the cafeteria of the First Workshop, but I also bought meal tickets for the other four cafeterias. I eat in this cafeteria today, and in that cafeteria tomorrow. Eating with the workers will reveal a lot of things. The factory director and the chairman of the trade union are also like this. They also play the piano, flute, and participate in various cultural and recreational activities of the workers. We all dress as plainly as the workers. When we are with the workers, we never think that there is any difference between us. Therefore, the workers are willing to talk to us about anything, and they can find us at any time.

Because we care for the workers in all aspects, the workers' production enthusiasm is very full. They constantly create advanced work methods, improve production efficiency, and save expenses. The factory comprehensively overfulfilled the 1956 national plan, with a production plan completion rate of 118.38%, and the first-class cotton cloth rate exceeded the central government's prescribed target by 0.67%. We have fundamentally changed the serious situation of losing money and not being able to pay wages in the private sector.

    依靠群众要先关心群众
    本报记者  张碨
    梁彦斌是湖北省襄樊市棉织厂党支部书记，她是一个非常关心群众生活，重视政治工作的人，曾经在湖北省工业政治会议上，受到省委的表扬。我请她谈谈她的工作情况，下边就是她的谈话。
    我们的厂子，去年实行了公私合营。全厂三百多人，住得很分散，情况也比较复杂。要办好企业，依靠群众很重要；要依靠群众，首先要关怀职工的思想和生活。这就是我们的工作经验。
    要辞退作临时工的工人家属
    先说明道理，又给想出后路
    今年1月份，襄樊市烟厂有十几个工人调来我们厂工作。我们厂的生产量有限，要安排这批工人，只好让原来轮流到厂里作临时工的二十三名家属退出。我们估计这可能引起家属和一部分工人的不满。所以，事先便召开党支部大会研究。我们分析家属的要求，主要是：参加劳动有一定的收入，可以补助家用。我们就计划把二十三名家属组织起来为全厂职工洗衣服，缝袜子，估计收入也不会少。大家在会上分了工，会后分头向家属和工人解释。果然不出所料，烟厂工人要来、家属要退出的消息传出以后，群众意见纷纷。我们一方面向工人和家属耐心说明家属如果不退出，烟厂的工人弟兄失了业，他们的家庭生活会更困难，况且家属退出后，参加洗衣劳动，还会有收入。另一方面，我先组织了魏建凤、王金荣、桂德花三个家庭生活最困难的家属，为职工洗衣服。其他的二十多名家属看了，觉得洗衣服收入也不坏，便都来要求参加洗衣组了。现在二十三名家属已经全部组织起来，她们分组为各车间职工洗衣服、拆被子，有时缝袜子、锁扣眼、纳鞋底。家属的情绪安定了，职工的情绪也安定了。
    食堂办不好影响工人健康
    领导干部亲自动手办伙食
    去年夏天，党员在小组会上反映了工人对食堂的意见：三车间工人说食堂有六不净：蒸笼不干净，案板不干净，抹布不干净，刷子不干净，灶台不干净，地面不干净。炊事员做馍用蒸笼水，搅面汤也用蒸笼水，工人喝了，个个跑肚子。馍馍里面经常有蚂蚁、蚊子。其他车间的食堂，大多也是饭稀、馍小、菜无味。
    党小组长把情况反映到支部后，支部认为问题严重，马上召开了支部大会，决定立即整顿食堂。我和厂长、工会主席等一起去检查各车间的食堂，对炊事员进行教育，又提议各食堂展开竞赛，先比比看谁做的馍馍好。我们发动一车间先进炊事员赵永宪做个榜样。
    接着，我们又通过先进炊事员提出比赛清洁卫生，比赛物美价廉，保证使工人吃饱，吃好，又省钱。在这个工作中，我们着重帮助了工人意见最多的三车间的食堂。整顿一车间食堂的时候，我和工会主席曾到食堂研究伙食不好的原因和改进的办法，还动手做了一顿饭给炊事员看。结果，这个食堂的伙食改进了。现在，整顿三车间食堂，我就把我们过去的作法告诉了三车间的伙食委员卢元炳。这天，他也自己去买菜，回来又蒸馍、炒菜、熬汤，认真做了一天的饭。他把厨房的用具弄得干干净净，做出来的菜花样多，好看、又好吃。工人们很满意。炊事员李万富受到了事实的教育后，赶紧把案板、蒸笼刷洗干净，又把厨房里的蚂蚁洞堵住，灶台上也用石灰粉刷新。菜也做得好吃了。其他车间的食堂，也学这个食堂的样子，改进了伙食。
    干部帮助工人晒被捉臭虫
    全厂开展了清洁卫生竞赛
    也是去年夏天的时候，我看见工人们个个人的背上都有许多红点子。不知道这是什么原因，我们就到职工集体宿舍去检查，发现吃得饱饱的臭虫，一串串地挤在床缝里。宿舍里，到处都丢得是花生壳、西瓜皮，人一走动，苍蝇、蚊子乱飞。绳子上搭得尽是脏衣服。
    工人宿舍的清洁卫生不搞好，会影响工人的健康。我们就趁工人不在宿舍，发动干部帮助工人晒被子、捉臭虫、打滴滴涕和扫地。三车间青年多，比较讲究清洁，我们就以三车间为重点，开展了卫生运动。工人们把床重新排了一下，被子该拆洗的拆洗了，床上铺得干干净净，墙上糊了白纸，还贴上些好看的画。他们把车间的织布机，也擦得耀眼明亮。我们组织各车间工人到三车间宿舍参观，还做了一面红旗，组织各车间宿舍开展清洁卫生竞赛。各车间的清洁卫生工作都搞起来了。现在，工人患病率大大减少，厂里每月的医药费开支，也由一百来元减少到二十元左右。
    找出工人情绪低落原因
    帮助解决孩子转学问题
    我们厂子在襄樊市的樊城，而五车间的工人却住在隔河的襄阳，这些工人很希望搬过来住。后来，厂里有了房子，五车间的工人就搬了过来。可是，我们发现搬过来的工人情绪不高了。
    有时候，他们三三两两在一起谈话，看见我们就走开了。是什么原因呢？去问，他们都不说。我们马上召集生产委员、工会主席等开会，他们也说不出道理。我就问：“据你们估计，是什么原因呢？”他们说：“他们自己搬过来了，可是孩子无法转学，这边又没住处，不得不把孩子丢在襄阳。孩子在那边没人照顾。大概是为这吧！”我们召开了工人大会，在会上批评了我们自己工作中的疏忽大意。我说：“我们马上帮你们的孩子转学，并且把孩子也搬过来，有孩子的住楼下，没孩子的住楼上，大家挤一挤住。还有什么意见，大胆提出来，我们共同研究解决。”听了这话，工人们的眉眼舒展了，你一言我一语，把心里的话都说出来了。会后，我们干部分了工，有的办理孩子转学的事情，有的到工人宿舍帮助钉窗户，修楼梯，……把能解决的问题都解决了。
    另外，我们经常访问工人的家庭，发现和解决问题，像夫妻不和睦、家属不会过日子等等。职工有了大的疾病或特殊困难，我们领导干部更是加倍关怀和体贴他们。
    领导干部同工人生活在一起
    经常研究职工们提出的意见
    我们厂里的干部那样少，怎能随时了解三百多职工的思想情况和生活上的细小问题呢？我们的办法是依靠大家去做。我们经常召开党、团员大会研究职工提出的问题，发动每个党员、每个团员、每个积极分子，甚至发动每个工人，都作思想工作，都帮助别人解决问题。另外，我们平时总和工人在一起。我经常是在一车间食堂吃饭，但我也买了其他四个食堂的饭票，今天在这个食堂吃，明天又到那个食堂吃。和工人一起吃饭，就会知道很多事情。厂长、工会主席也是如此。他们还和工人在一起弹琴、吹笛子，参加工人的各种文化娱乐活动。我们穿的都和工人一样朴素。和工人在一起的时候，从来没有想到彼此之间有什么不同。所以，工人们什么都愿意跟我们谈，什么时候也可以找到我们。
    由于我们从各方面关心工人，工人的生产情绪都很饱满。他们不断创造先进的工作方法，提高生产效率，节约费用。厂里全面超额完成了1956年的国家计划，产量计划完成118.38％，棉布正品率比中央规定的指标超过0.67％。我们已经从根本上改变了私营时期赔本、没钱发工资的严重情况。
