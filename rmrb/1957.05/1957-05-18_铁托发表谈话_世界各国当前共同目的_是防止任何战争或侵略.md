Xinhua News Agency, Belgrade, May 16th: On the eve of Yugoslavia's Anti-Fascist Victory Day (May 15), Yugoslav President Tito stated that the primary common goal of all countries in the world today is to prevent any war or aggression. The Yugoslav people and government appeal to all governments, political, social, and scientific organizations, and world public opinion to mobilize immediately to fight for the cessation of nuclear weapons testing, disarmament, and the peaceful resolution of outstanding international issues.

Tito expressed his views on the most pressing international tasks at the invitation of the editor-in-chief of the Yugoslav News Agency. He said that twelve years after the end of World War II, mankind must not only worry about the constant danger of war, but also about the consequences of atomic and hydrogen weapon tests. The arms race, especially the increasingly destructive weapons of mass destruction such as atomic weapons and other armaments, cannot but make the world panic. All past experience and current means of mass destruction clearly demonstrate that a new war will be more terrible, more widespread, and more destructive than past wars. In fact, it would have disastrous consequences for all of humanity.

    铁托发表谈话
    世界各国当前共同目的  是防止任何战争或侵略
    新华社贝尔格莱德16日电　在南斯拉夫反法西斯胜利纪念日（5月15日）前夕，南斯拉夫总统铁托发表谈话说，世界一切国家当前首要的共同目的就是防止任何战争或侵略。南斯拉夫人民和政府向一切政府，政治、社会和科学团体以及全世界的舆论呼吁，立即动员起来为取缔核武器试验、裁减军备和用和平方法解决悬而未决的国际问题而奋斗。
    铁托应南斯拉夫通讯社总编辑的邀请就当前最迫切的国际任务发表了意见。他说，在第二次世界大战结束十二年之后的今天，人类不仅要担心经常的战争危险，而且要担心原子和氢武器试验的后果，军备竞赛，特别是破坏力越来越大的大规模毁灭性的原子武器和其他军备不能不使世界人心惶惶。所有过去的经验和目前大规模毁灭手段都清楚地表明：一次新的大战将比过去的战争更加可怕、更广泛和更有破坏性，实际上它对整个人类都会有灾难性的后果。
