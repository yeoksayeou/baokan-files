Facing the Whole Nation, Promoting Academic Democracy, Strengthening the Power of the Academic Divisions
The Academy of Sciences Should Become the Academic Leadership Center
1956 Science Awards Presented at the Closing Ceremony of the Academy of Sciences Academic Divisions General Assembly

    This newspaper reports that the Second Plenary Meeting of the Academic Divisions of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, a forum for "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," closed in Beijing on the afternoon of the 30th.

    President Guo Moruo said in his closing remarks that this meeting unfolded contention and embodied the spirit of the current era, initially promoting academic democracy.

    Guo Moruo said that the work of the Academy of Sciences has achieved certain results in recent years. We cannot be blindly arrogant and complacent, but we should not underestimate ourselves or deny ourselves either. The evaluation should be appropriate, and perhaps it can be said that "it is generally good, but with many shortcomings." In the forty-one speeches given by fifty-three scientists at this conference, many shortcomings were pointed out, which should be the greatest gain of this conference. Most of everyone's opinions are pertinent and very valuable. But it cannot be denied that a small part of the opinions are not so pertinent, and there is still room for further research and consideration. He emphasized that some people emphasize facing research, facing the laboratory, which is good. But while we emphasized this aspect, we overlooked another aspect, that is, we underestimated scientific administrative work or scientific affairs work. Without scientific administrative work, it is difficult to imagine doing scientific research work well. Therefore, we must value our own labor and value the labor of others even more. We should not seem to have such a view: "All other professions are inferior, only research is noble."

    Guo Moruo said that the tasks of the Academy of Sciences were hotly debated at the meeting. Most comrades agreed that the Academy of Sciences should become the national academic leadership center, and that it should face the whole country and strengthen academic leadership in the future, which is as it should be. The question is how to face the whole country and how to strengthen academic leadership. The academic divisions are the key to academic leadership. To strengthen academic leadership, the power of the academic divisions must be strengthened.

    Guo Moruo specifically pointed out that many of the proposals and suggestions in the speeches at this meeting are very valuable. Those that can be adopted immediately will be adopted immediately. (The full text of the closing speech is on page seven)

    At the closing meeting, the academic division members listened to and approved the proposal review report of the proposal review group of this meeting. The report stated that the meeting received a total of fifty-two proposals from all attendees. These proposals are all worthy of attention. They are helpful to the solution of contradictions in the current scientific research work and conducive to the development of science in our country. The report put forward suggestions on the handling of various proposals.

    At the closing ceremony, the list of twenty-one newly appointed members of the Academic Divisions of the Chinese Academy of Sciences was announced. These newly appointed members of the Academic Divisions were elected at this meeting and approved by the Executive Committee of the Academy. At the closing ceremony, the list of the Drafting Committee of the Charter of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, totaling twenty-nine people including Zhu Kezhen, was also announced.

    The 1956 Science Awards (Natural Sciences Section) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences were presented to the award winners by President Guo Moruo at the closing ceremony.

    The meeting also passed a telegram regarding support for the patriotic and anti-American struggle of the Taiwan compatriots.

    面向全国　发扬学术民主　加强学部力量
    科学院应该成为学术领导中心
    科学院学部委员会全体会议闭幕会上颁发了1956年度科学奖金
    本报讯　作为百家争鸣讲坛的中国科学院学部委员会第二次全体会议30日下午在北京闭幕。
    郭沫若院长在闭幕词中说，这次会议展开了争鸣，体现了当前的时代精神，初步发扬了学术民主。
    郭沫若说，科学院的工作，几年来是有一定成绩的，不能盲目自大、自我陶醉，但也不要妄自菲薄、自我否定，评价应该恰如其分，也许可以说“大体还好，缺点不少。”在这次大会上五十三位科学家四十一次的发言中，提出了不少缺点，应该是这次大会的最大收获。大家的意见大部分是中肯的，很可宝贵的。但也不能否认，有一小部分的意见并不那么中肯，还有进一步研究和考虑的余地。他着重说，有的人强调面向研究、面向实验室，这是好的。但我们强调了这一面，却轻视了另一面，那就是轻视了科学行政工作或者科学事务工作。没有科学行政工作，要想做好科学研究工作，是很难设想的。所以我们要重视自己的劳动，更要重视别人的劳动。我们似乎不应该有这样的观点：“万般皆下品，唯有研究高”。
    郭沫若说，关于科学院的任务，在会议上进行了热烈的讨论。大部分同志都认定科学院应该成为全国学术领导的中心，今后要面向全国，加强学术领导，这是应该的。问题是如何面向全国，如何加强学术领导。学部是学术领导的关键，要求加强学术领导，必须加强学部的力量。
    郭沫若特别提出，这次会议的提案和发言中的建议，有好些是很有价值的。其中可以立即采纳的，便立即采纳了。（闭幕词全文见第七版）
    学部委员们在闭幕会上听取并通过了这次会议的提案审查小组的提案审查报告。报告说，这次会议收到各位出席人的提案共五十二件，这些提案都是值得重视的，它们有助于目前科学研究工作中矛盾的解决，有利于我国科学的发展。报告对各项提案的处理，分别提出了建议。
    闭幕式上宣布了增聘的中国科学院学部委员二十一人的名单。这些增聘的学部委员是经过这次会议推选，并经院务常务会议通过的。闭幕式上还宣布中国科学院院章起草委员会名单，计竺可桢等二十九人。
    中国科学院1956年度的科学奖金（自然科学部分），在闭幕式上由郭沫若院长分别授给奖金获得者。
    会议并通过关于声援台湾同胞的爱国反美斗争的通电。
