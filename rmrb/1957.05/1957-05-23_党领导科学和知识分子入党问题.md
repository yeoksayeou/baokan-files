    The Party Leads Science and the Issue of Intellectuals Joining the Party
    Hua Fangzeng
    I am a technician, and I believe that the Party can lead science. Because the Communist Party is a Marxist-Leninist party, and Marxism-Leninism itself is science. What's wrong with using science to lead science? Chairman Mao and other leading comrades in the Party have profoundly and thoroughly studied the essence of Marxism-Leninism—dialectical materialism. They have achieved great victories in the revolution through its specific application. This time, in resolving internal contradictions, they have once again brilliantly and creatively developed the application of dialectical materialism. In Engels' "Dialectics of Nature," many examples are given from mathematics, physics, and other natural sciences. So far, no new scientific discoveries have contradicted the basic principles of dialectical materialism, such as the unity of opposites and the leap from quantity to quality. I am convinced that the dialectical materialism mastered by the Party can unite social science and natural science. Combined with the unprecedentedly favorable conditions it has created for the people, it can rapidly advance science and shine brilliantly in the world within a short period of over a decade. At the same time, I also believe that through the unprecedented development of science, the content of dialectical materialism can be further enriched.
    However, why do deviations and errors occur in the specific leadership of production work and scientific research work by leading comrades in many enterprises, factories, and scientific and technological institutions? In extreme cases, some even find it impossible to continue? I believe that in general, it is less because they are laymen who do not understand science and technology, but more because their level of Marxism-Leninism is not high enough. Perhaps they will disagree with me when they hear this, but that is precisely where the problem lies. Most of these Party-member leading cadres participated in bloody struggles against the enemy and made great contributions. They sometimes have a misconception, thinking that while I may not understand science and technology, politics is my forte. Isn't it more than enough to lead you non-political cadres and the masses with my political prestige and level? So they become bureaucratic, subjective, and sectarian, never consulting or studying with scientific and technological departments in anything they do, listening to their opinions, understanding their difficulties, or clarifying their rights and wrongs. They just issue orders, thinking they are leading others with ideology. Isn't this how many things have been messed up?
    In addition, some comrades within the Party have a sense of inferiority. Compared to the intellectuals under their leadership, they have a lower level of education and do not understand science and technology. They are afraid that people with higher levels of knowledge will be difficult to lead, will ridicule them, and look down on them. In fact, this kind of thinking is unnecessary. To be frank, we scientific and technical personnel respect the revolution. As long as you are loyal to the people, loyal to the cause of the Party, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, we will naturally respect you and will not be overly critical. When it comes to science and technology, we are just a drop in the ocean, and we know too little to dare to be proud of it. We can learn from each other. Conversely, if you insist on thinking that your political capital is strong, that you are higher than us today and higher than us tomorrow, then you will be building a wall invisibly. Moreover, new things are constantly developing, and people are not immutable. If our views on certain political issues are more correct than yours, I don't think there is anything surprising about that. As Chairman Mao said, we have found a common language. We have traveled different paths in the journey of life. Let us converge from different routes and meet here.
    For comrades who will eventually converge, you must trust them and let them do things without suspicion. They should do scientific and technical work as well as political and ideological work.
    Chairman Mao instructed us intellectuals to study Marxism-Leninism. What is the ultimate destination of our future? If we study theory, we must practice it. If we want to practice it, we cannot work alone. At this time, we will inevitably think of the embrace of the organization. I often think, is it more effective for intellectuals to remain outside the Party, or is it more effective for them to join the Party? Everyone is talking about dismantling walls and filling ditches. Isn't absorbing them into the Party filling a major gap? Since the role of intellectuals is affirmed, it is ultimately beneficial for the Party to have more scientific and technical personnel. After listening to Comrade Ke Qingshi's report, which said that we are not prepared to develop a large number of intellectuals into Party members this year, we can only wait patiently while striving to join. At the same time, we hope that the Party will make a comprehensive assessment of the political future of our entire five million intellectuals, as well as the sincere desire to join the organization that will inevitably arise through learning and transformation, and make appropriate arrangements. This will play a great role in enhancing unity, organizing the strength of our intellectuals, and strengthening the Party's ranks.

    党领导科学和知识分子入党问题
    华方增
    我是一个技术人员，我是相信党能够领导科学的。因为共产党是一个马列主义的政党，马列主义本身即是科学，以科学来领导科学，有何不行呢？毛主席和党内其他领导同志，深湛地、透彻地研究了马列主义的精髓——辩证唯物论，在其具体运用中取得革命伟大的胜利，这次解决内部矛盾问题，又一次光辉地、创造性地发展了辩证唯物论的应用。在恩格斯所著自然辩证法之中，举了许多数学、物理学以及其他自然科学方面的例证。目前一切科学的新发现，还没有一条规律是与辩证唯物论的基本法则，如矛盾的统一，量到质的飞跃等等相抵触的。我确信党所掌握的辩证唯物论是可以把社会科学与自然科学统一起来的。而结合他领导人民所创造出来的空前有利的条件，是可以飞跃地把科学推向前，以便在短短十几年之内在世界上放出灿烂的异彩来的。同时，我亦相信，通过科学的空前发展，可以更加丰富辩证唯物论的内容。
    但是，为甚么还有许多企业工厂、科学技术机构的领导同志，在生产工作、科学研究工作的具体领导中，会发生偏差、错误，极个别的甚至有搞不下去的情况呢？我认为，一般的情况，与其说因为他们是门外汉，不懂科学技术，还不如说因为他们马列主义水平还不够。我这样说，也许他们听了不服气，而毛病恰恰就发生在这里。这些党员领导干部，大多数参加了对敌的流血斗争，立了汗马的功劳。他们有时会有一种错觉，自以为科学技术我不懂，政治是我的拿手，以我的政治威望和水平来领导你们非政治干部和群众还不是绰乎有余么？于是他们就官僚、主观、宗派起来，干甚么都不与科学技术部门商量研究，倾听他们的意见，了解他们的困难，弄清他们的是非曲直。他就发号施令，自以为在拿思想领导别人，有许多事情不就是这样搞糟了的么？
    另外有些党内同志则有些自卑感，比起自己领导下的知识分子，文化程度低，科学技术不懂，生怕知识程度高的人不好领导，会讥笑，瞧不起他们。其实这种想法是不必要的。说句知心话，我们科学技术人员是尊重革命的，只要你忠于人民，忠于党的事业，按毛主席的话办事，我们自会肃然起敬，不致向你们求全责备的。说到科学技术，我们也是沧海一粟，懂得太少，那敢以此向你们骄傲呢？互相学习么。相反的，如果你们硬以为自己政治资本雄厚，今天比我们高，明天也比我们高，那在无形之中倒会筑起墙来。而且新鲜事物是不断发展的，人们也不是一成不变的。偶然某些政治问题上我们的见解比你们正确了，我想这也没有甚么惊奇。正如毛主席所说的，我们找到了共同的言语，我们在人生的行程中走了不同的路，让我们异途同归，就在此地会师罢。
    终于要会师的同志，你就要给他信任，放手叫他做事情，不可对他产生疑忌。科学技术工作要他做，政治思想工作亦要他做。
    毛主席指示我们知识分子学习马列主义，我们前途的归宿究竟何在呢？学了理论就要实践，要实践就不能单干，这时候，势所必至的要想到组织的怀抱。我常想到知识分子留在党外发生作用大呢？还是入了党发生作用大呢？大家谈拆墙填沟，吸收他们入党不是填塞了一条主要的鸿沟么？既肯定了知识分子的作用，党内多些科学技术人员究竟还是有利的。听了柯庆施同志的报告，说本年不准备大量发展知识分子的党员，我们当然只有耐心等待，一面努力争取；同时我们希望党对我们整个五百多万知识分子的政治前途，以及通过学习和改造势所必然会产生出来的要参加组织的衷心愿望，作一个全面的估计，适当的安排。这对增强团结，组织我们知识分子的力量，壮大党的队伍，会发生很大的作用的。
