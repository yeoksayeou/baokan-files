Xinhua News Agency reporter Tian Lin reports: I recently interviewed Minister of Communications Zhang Bojun and asked him to express some opinions on the problems that need to be solved in the rectification campaign of the Communist Party organization of the Ministry of Communications. Minister Zhang Bojun made the following points:

    I. The Ministry of Communications' political and ideological leadership and professional and ideological leadership are not strong enough, and the leadership is often caught up in busy affairs. In recent years, the Ministry of Communications has often been engaged in organizational structure, internal division of labor, and personnel arrangements, etc., and has not concentrated more efforts on studying important policies and guidelines. Therefore, although the tasks have been completed, they have been very passive. For example, the construction of the Kangzang Highway is a major event in transportation work in recent years, but the Ministry of Communications has not actively put forward its own opinions in this regard.

    II. In its leadership work, the Ministry of Communications is like a near "transfer" agency, feeling that the higher authorities are managing too much and not providing enough assistance. As a ministry, it has not developed the habit of being the master of its own affairs and rarely plays an independent thinking role. In the past, the Central Finance and Economics Commission and the Three Offices called and ordered to do whatever they wanted. Now it is the Six Offices. At the same time, in terms of highway construction, the work is often in a passive position. In recent years, the Ministry of Communications has only done contracting work for several major events in transportation work, such as the Kangzang Highway, Tanggu New Port, and Zhanjiang Port. Minister Zhang Bojun said: The "Offices" and "Commissions" of the State Council have provided a lot of help to the Ministry, but unfortunately they manage too much. The Ministry of Communications can play a more autonomous and active role in many tasks. Minister Zhang Bojun said that the responsible cadres of the Ministry of Communications are quite strong. Some have become experts, and some, although they have not become experts, have become semi-experts. They understand the business, can do things, and have confidence. The ministry should be given more power to be independently responsible. He said that the State Council's leadership system and methods for the ministry should now be considered for change. Otherwise, the overlapping of institutions and excessive restrictions will not only waste manpower, but also prevent the ministry from fully playing its leading role.

    III. The Ministry of Communications has done a good job in mass work. In recent years, the Ministry of Communications has managed to bring many 10,000-ton ships back from overseas. The democratic parties have done a lot of work in this regard, and the experience in this area should be well summarized to facilitate further efforts.

    In addition, Minister Zhang Bojun also talked about the experience of the Ministry of Communications in past movements such as "Suppressing Counterrevolutionaries" and "Three-Anti." He said that he hopes that the current Communist Party rectification campaign will be carried out well, with more consultation with the masses and more debate. He said that too little has been done in this area in the past. Recently, when the Ministry of Communications called for rectification, many people still dare not speak, fearing that it will lead to bad consequences.

    章伯钧部长谈整风中需要解决的问题
    交通部应着重研究政策方针
    本报特约新华社18日讯　新华社记者田林报道：记者最近访问了交通部章伯钧部长，请他就交通部中共党组织整风中需要解决的问题发表一些意见。章伯钧部长讲了下面几点意见：
    一、交通部的政治思想领导和业务思想领导都不够强，领导常常陷于忙乱的事务。几年以来，交通部常常在搞机构，搞内部分工和人事安排等等，没有集中更多的力量研究重要的政策方针，所以任务虽然完成了，但是很被动。如康藏公路的修建是近几年交通工作中的大事，但是，交通部在这方面并没有主动地提出自己的意见。
    二、交通部在领导工作上有近“承转”机关，觉得上面管得太多，帮助不够，作为部没有很好地养成当家作主的习惯，很少发挥独立思考作用，过去是中财委和三办打电话叫干什么就干什么，现在是六办了，同时，在进行公路建设方面，工作往往处于被动地位。几年来交通工作方面的几件大事如康藏公路、塘沽新港、湛江港等的建设，交通部只做了承包工作。章伯钧部长说：国务院的“办”和“委”对部原给予不少的帮助，但可惜管得太多，在许多工作上交通部还可发挥更多的自主的积极性。章伯钧部长说，现在交通部的负责干部相当强，有的已经成为内行，有的虽然没有成为内行也成了半内行。他们懂业务，能作事，有信心。应该让部的权力更大些，能够独立来负责。他说，国务院对部的领导制度和方式，现在是应该考虑改变一下了，否则机构重叠，制约过多，不仅浪费人力，而且使部不能充分发挥主管作用。
    三、交通部的群众工作作得好，几年来交通部争取到很多万吨轮船自海外归来。民主党派在这方面作了许多工作，对这方面的工作经验应该很好地加以总结，以利于进一步争取的工作。
    此外，章伯钧部长也谈到过去交通部在“肃反”和“三反”等运动中的经验，他说，希望这次中共整风好好搞，多跟群众商量，多争辩。他说，过去这方面做得太少了，最近交通部号召整风尚有许多人不敢说话，恐怕招到不好的后果。
