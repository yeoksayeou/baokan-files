Xinhua News Agency, 8th: The Chinese Communist Party's Leading Party Group of the Ministry of Higher Education held an enlarged meeting on the 7th to discuss rectification issues.

At the enlarged meeting of the Leading Party Group, many people stated that the Ministry of Higher Education should not conduct rectification behind closed doors but should face the entire country and fully utilize the favorable conditions for rectification that have been formed nationwide.

What specific problems exist in higher education work? What should the Ministry of Higher Education rectify? Before the meeting, some people believed that the contradictions in the Ministry of Higher Education were partly long-standing contradictions in higher education, partly contradictions that urgently needed to be resolved currently, and partly internal contradictions within the organization. Long-term contradictions, such as the contradiction between quantity and quality, and the issue of understanding the ideological leadership of Marxism-Leninism and implementing the "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" policy, although not completely separate from current contradictions, cannot be thoroughly resolved all at once.

This rectification, combined with summarizing the work of higher education in recent years, mainly focuses on solving the problems in the Ministry of Higher Education's leadership of school work in the past, such as insufficient integration of Soviet experience with China's actual conditions, with shortcomings of mechanically copying; excessive negation of China's original traditions and higher education heritage; insufficient reliance on schools and teachers, with excessive unification and overly rigid control; and insufficient unity with non-Party professors in schools. These are all related to the bureaucratic and subjectivist style of the Ministry of Higher Education's leadership ideology and a lack of deep understanding of the characteristics of Chinese higher education. The purpose of this rectification is to summarize some experiences in how the Party leads higher education and how the Party leads senior intellectuals by raising awareness, correcting shortcomings, and resolving the above contradictions. Some people have proposed that regarding the issue of how the Party leads higher education, there are currently two main specific aspects: one is to create conditions for effectively improving the quality of higher education; the other is how to change the past practice of excessive and overly rigid control, boldly implement the "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" policy, and fully unleash the initiative and enthusiasm of schools and teachers. Others have said: Regarding summarizing the issue of how the Party leads senior intellectuals, the main focus is on understanding and grasping the characteristics of Chinese higher education and senior intellectuals and correctly leveraging their roles.

### 高等教育部：  解决领导学校工作中的问题

    高等教育部：
    解决领导学校工作中的问题
    据新华社8日讯　中共高等教育部党组7日举行扩大会议讨论整风问题。
    党组扩大会议上很多人表示，高教部不能关门整风，要面向全国，充分利用这个在全国范围内形成的对整风的有利条件。
    高等教育工作中到底存在一些什么问题？高教部整风整什么？会议以前，有人认为高教部的矛盾有的是高等教育工作中长远存在的矛盾，有的是当前迫切需要解决的矛盾，也有的是机关内部的矛盾。长远的矛盾，例如数量和质量的矛盾，对于贯彻马克思列宁主义的思想领导和贯彻“百花齐放、百家争鸣”方针的认识问题，这两方面虽然不能和当前矛盾绝然分开，但都是不能一下子解决透彻的。
    这次整风，结合着总结几年来高等教育工作，主要是解决高等教育部过去对学校工作的领导上，学习苏联经验结合中国实际不够，有生搬硬套的缺点，对中国原有的传统和高等教育遗产否定过多；依靠学校、依靠教师不够，统一过多，管得过死；对学校中非党教授团结得不够。这都和高教部领导思想、作风的官僚主义、主观主义，没有深刻了解中国高等教育特点有关。这次整风的目的，是要从提高思想，改正缺点和解决上述矛盾中，总结一些党如何领导高等教育，以及党如何来领导高级知识分子的经验。有人提出，关于党如何领导高等教育的问题，目前主要的有两个具体内容：一是创造条件，如何有效地提高高等教育的质量；一是如何改变过去管得过多、过死的做法，放手贯彻“百花齐放、百家争鸣”方针，充分发挥学校和教师们的主动性和积极性。也有人说：关于总结党如何领导高级知识分子问题，主要在于了解掌握中国高等教育和高级知识分子的特点，正确发挥他们的作用。
