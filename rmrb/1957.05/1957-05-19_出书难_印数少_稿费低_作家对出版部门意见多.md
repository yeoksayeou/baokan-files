Writers Have Many Opinions on Publishing Departments Due to Difficult Publishing, Small Print Runs, and Low Royalties

    (Our Report) The Ministry of Culture held two consecutive meetings on the afternoon of the 16th and the morning of the 18th, inviting writers and translators to discuss criticisms and opinions on the Ministry of Culture's leadership in publishing work.

    Translator Zhang Yousong believes that publishing houses are currently out of touch with the masses and bureaucratic. Many tasks are often changed arbitrarily. For example, the People's Literature Publishing House originally commissioned him to compile "Selected Works of Mark Twain," but when the selection was published, the word "Selected Works" was changed to "Works" without consulting the translator. The People's Literature Publishing House once went out to solicit manuscripts, but the editorial department accumulated many manuscripts without processing them. Professional translators have no dormitories, medical care is at their own expense, cloth and oil rations are less than those of cadres, and asking for royalties is ridiculed. In the eyes of the police, they are considered unemployed. Society does not understand them, and publishing houses do not understand them either. Books should be reprinted immediately when they are needed.

    Jin Ren, the translator of "And Quiet Flows the Don" and "God's Little Acre," believes that the publishing houses' subject selection plans encourage competitive translation. The New Literature and Art Publishing House's translation projects cannot be completed in five years. He said: Does this mean that no new translators will emerge in five years? Books that can be translated are all included in the publishing houses' subject selection, so translators have to rush to translate those books that are not included. He suggests that publishing houses can have more branches to foster competition. Regarding royalties, Jin Ren said that the power over royalties is now in the hands of the publishing houses, and some people in the publishing houses even believe that "giving them more royalties will encourage their corruption." However, for writers, the problem now is not that royalties are too high, but that they are unreasonably low. Royalties should be used to promote creation and translation. It is also inappropriate not to print the translator's name on the book.

    Playwright Wu Zuguang believes that the bureaucracy of publishing institutions is due to their large size. He compared the work efficiency of the former Kaiming Bookstore with that of the current People's Literature Publishing House, believing that Kaiming Bookstore was more efficient. He said that "Homecoming on a Snowy Night" is currently being staged in various places, but the book has not been reprinted. The right to reprint is in the hands of the bookstores, and Xinhua Bookstore has become the largest authority controlling the fate of writers.

    Ye Junjian, a researcher of Andersen's works, believes that the relationship between writers and publishers must be very close. Publishing houses should ideally have a regular relationship with a group of authors. Regarding publishing contracts, Ye Junjian believes that contracts should not only stipulate royalties but also publishing deadlines.

    Poet Zang Kejia said: The Publishing Bureau does not value non-Party members and veteran publishers. Zhang Xichen has complained, and Zhang Jinglu also has grievances. Sun Fuyuan was a veteran writer of the "May Fourth" era, but he was tortured every day at the Publishing Bureau until he suffered a stroke. Because of his low rank, he was placed in a six-person ward, and no one helped him transfer to another hospital when it was discovered.

    Veteran poet Wang Jingzhi talked about his own experience. He was originally an editor at the People's Literature Publishing House, but since he became a special editor paid by royalties, he could not even maintain his livelihood because he wrote slowly.

    Folklore expert Zhong Jingwen said: The People's Literature Publishing House has opened its doors a bit, but not enough. Although he has written hundreds of thousands of words since liberation, he has not been able to collect them for publication. He said, "If the door is so tight, why stick your head in and let it get caught!" Zhong Jingwen also pointed out that there is serious sectarianism in "Folklore." Party members' articles can be published without his consent as the person in charge, and his own articles cannot be published in "Folklore." Party leaders only look for Party members and do not look for him, so he only heard from other places that the Folklore Research Association was transferred to the leadership of the Academy of Sciences.

    Writer Yan Wenjing spoke on the issue of royalties. He believes that royalties are the most concerning and acute issue for writers in recent years, and if it is not resolved in time, there will be trouble. According to surveys, many veteran writers have no money, and some young writers have a lot of savings, but this is a minority. It is generally believed that royalties are not high now and cannot be reduced further.

    Before the meeting ended, Feng Xuefeng, director of the People's Literature Publishing House, and Wang Renshu, deputy director, spoke. Wang Renshu announced an exciting news: the publishing authorities recently approved 10,000 tons of paper (equivalent to 400,000 reams), so the People's Literature Publishing House can print as many books as it wants. Feng Xuefeng believes that writers have different working methods, which is a special kind of labor, and it is worthwhile to increase royalties a bit. The treatment of editors should be equal to that of professors.

### 出书难　印数少　稿费低  作家对出版部门意见多

    出书难　印数少　稿费低
    作家对出版部门意见多
    本报讯　文化部在16日下午和18日上午连续举行两次会议邀请作家、翻译家座谈对文化部领导出版工作方面的批评和意见。
    翻译家张友松认为目前出版社脱离群众，官僚主义很严重。许多工作，常常朝令夕改。如人民文学出版社原来是约他编译“马克吐温选集”，但当选集出来时却将“选集”二字换成了“著”字，也不征求译者同意。人民文学出版社曾出去组稿，但编辑部却积压许多稿件没有处理。职业的翻译工作者，居住无宿舍，医疗要自费，布票、油票比干部少，索稿费也受人讥笑，在公安人员心目中则被认为是无业游民。社会不了解，出版社也不了解。书应再版即再版。
   “静静的顿河”和“磨刀石农庄”的译者金人认为出版社的选题计划助长了抢译。新文艺出版社的翻译选题，五年都译不完。他说：难道五年内就不出新的翻译工作者了吗？可译的书都被出版社列入选题，于是翻译工作只好去抢译那些没有列入选题中去的书。他建议出版社可多办几个，展开竞赛。关于稿费问题，金人说稿费大权现在是操在出版社之手，有些出版社的人甚至认为“多拿稿费助长了他们的腐化思想”。然而对作家来说，现在不是稿费多的问题，而是少得不合理。稿费应用来繁荣创作、翻译。书面上不印翻译者的名字也是不应该的。
    剧作家吴祖光认为出版机构的官僚主义是由于摊子太大。他并以过去的开明书店和现在人民文学出版社的工作效率作了对比。认为开明书店效率是高的。他说“风雪夜归人”现在各地正在上演，可是书一直不再版。再版的权操在书店，新华书店成了最大的掌握作家命运的权威。
    安徒生著作研究者叶君健认为作家和出版社关系必需十分密切。出版社最好是和一批作者有经常的关系。谈到出版合同时，叶君健认为合同不仅约束稿费，也要约束出版时间。
    诗人臧克家说：出版局不重视党外人士及老出版家，章锡琛曾控诉过，张静庐也有牢骚。孙伏园是“五四”时代老作家，但在出版局天天挨整，被整得发了中风，由于级别低给他塞到一个六人住的病房里去，别人发现了也不帮助转院。
    老诗人汪静之谈了自己的遭遇。他原来是人民文学出版社编辑，自从改为特约编辑按稿费计酬，由于写稿慢连生活也不能维持。
    民间文学专家钟敬文说：人民文学出版社现在的门虽开了一些，但还开得不够。解放以来虽写了几十万字，也没搜集起来出版。他说：“门这末紧，何必伸头进去让它夹断！”钟敬文也指出“民间文学”存在严重的宗派主义，党员的文章不经我这负责人同意就可发出去，我自己的文章“民间文学”上也登不出。党的领导同志，只找党员，不找他，以致像民间文学研究会转归科学院领导的事也还是他从别的地方听到的。
    作家严文井就稿费问题发言。他认为稿费是几年来作家最关心的也是最尖锐的问题，解决得如不及时要闹事。据调查老作家很多都没有钱，有些青年作家反而有很多存款，但也是少数。一般认为现在稿费并不算高。不能再降低了。
    在会议结束前，人民文学出版社社长冯雪峰和副社长王任叔发言。王任叔宣布了一个令人兴奋的消息，出版主管部门最近批准了一万吨纸（合四十万令），以后人民文学出版社要印多少书就可印多少了。冯雪峰认为作家的劳动方法不同，这是一种特殊劳动，稿费提高些，这点投资是划算的。编辑同教授的待遇要平等。
