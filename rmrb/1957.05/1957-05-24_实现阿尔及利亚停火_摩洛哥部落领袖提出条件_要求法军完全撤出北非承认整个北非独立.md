Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, May 23rd:  Hattab, a leader of the Rif tribes in Morocco, stated here on May 22nd that achieving a ceasefire in Algeria should be based on two conditions: (1) France must recognize the complete independence of the entire North Africa; (2) French troops must completely withdraw from North Africa within one year.

    Hattab made these remarks while commenting on recent news about efforts to achieve a ceasefire in Algeria. Hattab said that without a doubt, any free person demands that France immediately stop the massacres being carried out in North Africa.

    Hattab said that these conditions for a ceasefire should be achieved through the United Nations, without direct negotiations with France. He also said, "If France accepts these conditions, we can discuss the details with France, but also through the United Nations."

    He suggested that Arab countries and Asian-African countries request the United Nations to intervene in the Algerian issue.

    实现阿尔及利亚停火
    摩洛哥部落领袖提出条件
    要求法军完全撤出北非承认整个北非独立
    新华社开罗23日电　摩洛哥里弗部落领袖哈塔布5月22日在这里说，在阿尔及利亚实现停火应当根据两个条件：（一）法国承认整个北非完全独立。（二）法国军队在一年内完全撤离北非。
    哈塔布是在评述最近关于设法使阿尔及利亚实现停火的消息时这样说的。哈塔布说，毫无疑问，任何自由人士都要求法国立即停止在北非进行的屠杀。
    哈塔布说，这些关于停火的条件应当通过联合国实现，不必同法国直接谈判，他又说：“如果法国接受这些条件，我们可以同法国讨论细节，不过也是通过联合国来进行。”
    他建议阿拉伯国家和亚非国家要求联合国干涉阿尔及利亚问题。
