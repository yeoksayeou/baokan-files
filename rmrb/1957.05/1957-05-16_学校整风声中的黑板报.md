    Blackboard newspapers at the Beijing Institute of Aeronautics are also contributing their strength to the rectification movement. Whether it's the "Aircraft News" of the "First Department," the "Lightning News" of the "Second Department," or the "Power News" of the "Third Department" and the "Flame News" of the "Fourth Department," they are all full of the voices of the masses, reflect the feelings of the masses, and offer sharp criticism and valuable opinions to the administrative leadership.

    An article in "Aircraft News" wrote:
   “For the sake of the socialist cause (everyone knows that this is not the private affair of the Party, but the common affair of thousands of people), let us speak out all the things we have kept in our hearts for the past few years, and let us not be afraid of the masses creating a ‘storm in the city’, but see it as the indispensable sunshine for people!
   “To carry out rectification and to mobilize the masses, we must let everyone speak their minds freely!”
   "Aircraft News" also published a manuscript that revealed the reason why the rectification movement of the Party organization of the Institute of Aeronautics has been slow to develop, saying: "Comrades criticize our institute for moving too slowly. … Why can't we move forward? The problem lies in the fact that the leading cadres of the institute cannot put down their feet, come down from their high positions, change their work style, and get close to the masses. In this rectification, can we rectify the working style of the leaders at the very beginning? Check how well democracy has been promoted?"
   "Power News" published an article by Xiao Zhong entitled "No, We Cannot Be Silent!" The article wrote: "...Good! The First Department is starting to 'speak up'... Dear comrades, we are about to become members of the Communist Youth League... It requires us to love life and devote our lives to the realization of the beautiful ideal of mankind—communism. It requires us to protect the interests of the Party like protecting our eyes. For this reason, we are required to wage an uncompromising struggle against all unreasonable phenomena and all hidden reefs in the process of advancement!” The comrades of the "Lightning News" editorial department were working hard last night to edit today's issue of the blackboard newspaper to meet everyone. In this issue, there is a report entitled "Everyone Come to Tear Down Walls and Fill Ditches," which records that at a forum of veteran teachers held by the "Second Department" on the 14th of this month, Professor Lin Shi'e, Associate Professor Yu Dexing, Lecturer Wang Zhenjun and others made sharp criticisms of the working style of the school Party committee and the leadership of the departments, as well as various aspects of the work.

    Professor Lin Shi'e said: The problem of tearing down walls and filling ditches, although the wall between the Party and non-Party members in the Institute of Aeronautics is not "higher than Fuxingmen" as reported in the newspaper, it may become worse if it continues to develop. He said: We must tear down the wall and fill the ditch through this rectification movement.

    Associate Professor Yu Dexing said: The Party members of the Institute of Aeronautics do not argue or offer opinions on some tasks, but they actually have opinions. For example, the confidentiality regulations of the Institute of Aeronautics in the past were very unreasonable. When teachers and students went to factories for internships, the interns did not know which factory they were going to until they arrived at the factory. Party members also have opinions about this matter, but they did not raise them.

    Lecturer Wang Zhenjun said: Originally, I didn't want to talk in this movement, and I felt that it was best to say less, but the words were on my throat, and it was not good not to say them. I also think that the leadership of the Institute of Aeronautics has too much official airs, and it seems that it is impossible without an official position.

    On the blackboard newspaper, you can also see the masses criticizing President Wu Guang's mobilization report for the rectification was not connected to reality, not connected to thought, and did not solve problems.

    An announcement on the blackboard newspaper reads that due to the very enthusiastic contributions from the public, it is not yet possible to publish all the manuscripts. We are glad to see that the blackboard newspaper has also played its role in carrying out the rectification movement!

    学校整风声中的黑板报
    北京航空学院的黑板报，也在整风运动中贡献它们的力量了。它们无论是“一系”的“飞机报”， “二系”的“闪电报”，还是“三系”的“动力报”和“四系”的“火焰报”，都充满了群众的声音，反映了群众的心意，对行政领导上提出了尖锐的批评和宝贵的意见。
    在“飞机报”上一篇文章里，写道：
   “为了社会主义事业（大家都知道这不是党的私事，而是千万人民共同的事业），让我们把我们几年来的话都讲出来吧，不要怕群众
  ‘满城风雨’，而把它看成人所不可缺少的阳光吧！
   “要整风，要发动群众，就得放手让大家讲话！”
   “飞机报”上还刊登了一篇稿子，揭露航空学院党组织整风运动所以迟迟不能开展的原因说：“同志们批评我院动作太慢。……为什么前进不了呢？问题就在于院领导干部放不下脚，下不来楼，改不了作风，接近不了群众。这次整风，能不能在开始就整一下领导的工作作风？检查一下民主发扬的怎么样？”
   “动力报”刊登晓钟写的一篇稿子“不，我们不能沉默！”文中写道：“……好！一系‘鸣’起来了……亲爱的同志们，我们马上就要成为共青团员了……她要求我们热爱生活，为人类美好的理想——共产主义的实现而献出毕生的努力，她要求我们像保护眼珠一样保护党的利益。为此就要求我们对一切不合理的现象，对前进中的一切暗礁，进行毫不妥协的斗争！”“闪电报”的编辑同志们，昨天晚上正在紧张地编辑着今天和大家见面的一期黑板报。在这期内容中，有一篇题为“大家都来拆墙填沟”的报道，记载了“二系”在本月14日举行的一次老教师的座谈会上，林士谔教授、余德星副教授、王振均讲师等，对学校党委和院系领导上的作风以及各方面的工作，提出了尖锐的批评。
    林士谔教授说：拆墙填沟问题，在航院党与非党员的墙虽然不比报上登的“比复兴门还高”，但如果发展下去，可能更坏些。他说：我们一定要通过这次整风运动，把墙拆掉，把沟填平。
    余德星副教授说：航院的党员对有些工作不争论，不提意见，可是他们实际上是有意见的，如过去航院的保密规定很不合理，让教师和学生下厂实习，要到工厂了，实习的人还不知道到那个工厂去。这事情，党员也有意见，可是就未提。
    王振均讲师说：本来这次运动中，不想谈，觉得少说为妙，但话在喉头，不说不好。我也认为航院的领导上官架子太大，似乎没有一官半职就不行。
    在黑板报上，还可以看到群众批评武光院长的整风动员报告作得不联系实际，不联系思想，不解决问题。
    黑板报的一个启事上写着，因投稿人非常踊跃，稿件还不可能一一刊登出来。我们高兴地看到，黑板报在开展整风运动当中也起了它的作用！
