    Prevent Atomic War, Protect the Next Generation
    Mrs. Gordon Calls on Parents to Unite
    Xinhua News Agency, May 24th: The Chinese People's National Committee for the Defense of Children recently received an open letter from Mrs. Gordon, President of the Women's International Democratic Federation. In the letter, Mrs. Gordon called on all people who desire a secure future and hope for human progress to unite, prevent the disaster of atomic war, and protect children.
    Mrs. Gordon said in the letter: "Now, the atomic danger, which poses a very terrible threat to our children and future generations, is invisibly increasing, so great efforts must be made to save humanity."
    The open letter said: "Of course, it is women's nature to be particularly vigilant, but concern for the fate of children is not limited to them.
    At Easter in 1952, doctors, scientists, artists, educators, parents, and people with various views from all over the world held the International Conference for the Defense of Children in Vienna to find ways to protect children from hunger, disaster, ignorance, and war. The meeting designated June 1st as International Children's Day, as a festival to safeguard the rights of all children to enjoy welfare and happiness.
    Today, in view of the repeated nuclear tests, the increasing number of atomic weapons and atomic bases, and the continuous manufacture of missiles, every opportunity should be used to make the people see the facts and encourage them to take action against the atomic danger. We ask all people who desire a safe future and hope for human progress to make this year's International Children's Day a particularly important festival. We call on the many forces in countries all over the world who usually act in isolated ways—scientists, teachers, writers, and parents—to unite as they did in Vienna; we call on all women, mothers, women's groups, doctors, teachers, writers, and parents to unite as they did in Vienna in 1952 to prevent the disaster of atomic war.
    June 1, 1957, this day should demonstrate the firm will held by all people, which is: "They are determined to oppose this crazy action of preparing for atomic war that is already seriously threatening them, thereby saving our children—the future of mankind." (Attached picture)

    防止原子战  保护下一代
    戈登夫人呼吁父母们团结起来
    新华社24日讯　中国人民保卫儿童全国委员会最近收到了国际民主妇女联合会主席戈登夫人的一封公开信。戈登夫人在信中呼吁一切要求获得安全的未来、希望人类取得进步的人们团结起来，防止原子战争的灾难，保护儿童。
    戈登夫人在信中说：“现在，对于我们的儿童和后代具有十分可怕的危害的原子危险，正在无形中增加起来，因此必须进行极大的努力来挽救人类。”
    公开信说：“固然，妇女的天性就是特别警惕的，但是关心儿童命运的并不限于她们。
    1952年复活节的时候，全世界各国的医生、科学家、艺术家、教育家、父母们和抱有各种主张的人们，在维也纳举行国际保卫儿童大会，设法保护儿童而使他们免遭饥饿、灾害、无知和战争。会议规定6月1日为国际儿童节，作为维护一切儿童享受福利和幸福的权利的节日。
    今天，原子核试验屡次进行，原子武器和原子基地有增无减，导弹纷纷制造出来，鉴于这种情况，应该利用一切机会让人民看到事实，并且鼓励他们采取行动来反对原子危险。我们要求一切希望获得安全的未来、希望人类取得进步的人们，设法使今年的国际儿童节成为特别重要的节日。我们呼吁全世界各国中通常在各个孤立的方面进行活动的许多力量——科学家、教师、作家和父母们——像在维也纳一样地团结起来；我们呼吁一切妇女、母亲们、妇女团体、医生、教师、作家和父母们像1952年在维也纳一样地团结起来，防止原子战争的灾难。
    1957年6月1日这一个日子应该表现出一切人所抱有的坚定意志来，那就是：“他们决心反对已经在严重地威胁着他们的这种准备原子战争的疯狂行动，从而挽救我们的儿童——人类的未来。”（附图片）
