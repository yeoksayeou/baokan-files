The Party Should Be the Intellectuals' "Confidant"
Wang Zhen, Professor of Beijing Normal University

The Party should act as the intellectuals' "confidant" and give them correct evaluations. Intellectuals should progress from the "a scholar dies for his confidant" mercenary mentality to the "not shirking responsibility" and "everyone is responsible for building socialism" sense of ownership.

In universities, the relationship between the Party and senior intellectuals is still not harmonious enough, and a few intellectuals even have serious antagonistic emotions towards the Party. There are many reasons for this situation. From the perspective of the Party in universities, one of the most important reasons is that the Party is not good at being the "confidant" and "close" friend of senior intellectuals, and leading and helping intellectuals to move forward from the position of "confidant" and "close friend."

Chinese intellectuals have the traditional thought of "a scholar dies for his confidant," and repaying the "grace of recognition" for thousands of years. In this sense, in universities, the Party has not been able to act as the "confidant" and "close" friend of senior intellectuals. There are many reasons for this. First of all, the Party members in universities are not familiar with the profession that intellectuals are engaged in, do not understand the joys and sorrows of it, and cannot give a correct evaluation of their profession. Party members in universities can be roughly divided into two parts. One part is veteran revolutionary cadres. In the past, they were busy fighting against the enemy, and some of them never had the opportunity to study natural sciences and historical and cultural knowledge in depth. Some of them studied in the past, but gradually became unfamiliar and abandoned them in the long-term struggle against the enemy. Therefore, they cannot understand intellectuals from their professional level and the quality of their work, so they cannot give them a correct evaluation. The other part is young teachers who graduated from the school after liberation. For senior intellectuals, these people were their students yesterday, and of course they cannot fully understand the work of their teachers quickly. There was such a thing that an assistant teacher once advised a professor to send many of his books to make paper, because he thought that the professor's books were outdated and useless. Some professors were labeled with feudal ideology for buying a few Buddhist scriptures, and were demoted by one level when evaluating salaries (see Feng Youlan's "New Atmosphere and New Efforts" in the People's Daily on April 24). If you don't really understand a person's talent, of course it is impossible to arrange this person in an appropriate job, and naturally it is impossible to be this person's true "confidant". We are not without shortcomings in understanding the morality of intellectuals. Generally speaking, the historical and social relations of senior intellectuals in universities are relatively complicated. We often do not understand the complexity of old Chinese society and underestimate the progress of senior intellectuals. Therefore, we often exaggerate their historical shortcomings and the existing backward side, and are surprised by the complexity of their social relations. In this way, naturally we cannot give a correct evaluation of their morality, and of course it is impossible to arrange them in appropriate jobs. From this point of view, we cannot be the "confidant" and "close" friend of intellectuals. Although our Party has made great efforts in helping intellectuals study Marxism-Leninism and has achieved certain results, because it is not familiar with the business that intellectuals are engaged in, this kind of help cannot but fall into generalization, and cannot improve their Marxism-Leninism level from their profession, so that they can apply the Marxism-Leninism they have learned to their profession, so this work is not in-depth.

In this case, the Party in universities generally has two methods in evaluating and arranging the work of intellectuals. One is to follow the "mass line," which is also a major method. Major measures of the school are decided by the school committee or other mass meetings. For example, the issue of grading is often decided by the professors themselves through mutual discussion to determine preliminary opinions, and the Party leadership basically handles it according to their opinions. If there are no major problems in the leadership, this method can solve problems and prevent problems from occurring. However, this tail-following leadership method can never make senior intellectuals feel that the Party is their true "confidant," nor can it establish true prestige in them, and this method cannot give a correct evaluation to every intellectual, so that the school measures can be genuinely agreed by everyone. For example, some professors have publicly stated that the school leadership only makes major decisions based on the common sense or perceptual knowledge of the masses. This leadership method is often manifested in excessive care for senior intellectuals in life and formal respect in daily contact, manifested as being respectful and polite. In fact, intellectuals with real talents and practical learning are most concerned about people's respect for their profession and the proper evaluation of their profession. Only taking care of them in material life without truly understanding their expertise, they will feel "frustrated" and the loneliness and sadness of having no "confidant" and "close friend." One method is to act subjectively, thinking that they are great even though they don't understand, and dogmatism and sectarianism dominate them, saying that this person is not good, and that person is not good, "once power is in hand, they will issue orders," and ruthlessly strike others at every turn, making the other party silent and daring not to speak. As mentioned above, a certain professor was demoted and had his salary reduced because he bought a few Buddhist scriptures. This will naturally arouse dissatisfaction among some intellectuals with the Party and stand in opposition emotionally. For example, many universities' Party organizations, because they do not know the joys and sorrows of teaching, under the instructions of the Ministry of Higher Education and the Ministry of Education, forced the implementation of a workload system among teachers, but as a result, it had to be abandoned because it did not work. Therefore, the thorough solution to this problem must strengthen the Party's forces in universities, give Party members time to study their business, so that Party members can become red experts, and at the same time absorb progressive people among senior intellectuals into the Party, so that the Party can become the confidant of intellectuals and truly lead the intellectuals of universities. Of course, it is more important to correct dogmatism and sectarianism, because if these evil winds are not removed, they will not only seriously hinder the unity between the Party and intellectuals, but also make it impossible for them to progress themselves, from not understanding to truly understanding, from half-knowledge to red experts. Only when there are a large number of true red experts in universities can the Party truly lead senior intellectuals to advance together.

What is said above is from the Party's perspective. In addition, from the intellectuals' perspective, there are also areas that should be improved. The idea of "a scholar dies for his confidant," and repaying the "grace of recognition," in a sense, this is a complete mercenary view, which is very incompatible with the people's democratic regime as the master of the country. In addition to what is said above, the historical tradition of Chinese intellectuals also has another excellent historical tradition, which is to have the great ambition of "establishing the heart for heaven and earth, establishing life for the people, continuing the unique learning for the past sages, and creating peace for all generations," which is the conscious sense of ownership of "not shirking responsibility" and "everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the country." It is of course good for the Party to be my "confidant." I am willing to build a socialist society together with the Party under the leadership of the Party. Even if the Party is not my "confidant," I will strive to make the Party become my "confidant." It is not a passive attitude of "seeking to preserve one's life in troubled times, not seeking fame among the feudal lords," but should be: "benefit the world," "recommend oneself," and "feel anxious if there is no ruler for three months" in order to find comrades and confidants to jointly build a socialist society. It is also easy to deal with sectarianists and dogmatists, that is, to inherit another fine tradition of intellectuals, "not fearing the powerful," "being unyielding in the face of coercion," "a scholar can be killed, but not humiliated," and to fight against them. You dogmatists don't allow me to speak, but I insist on speaking. You sectarianists exclude me from your democratic scope, but I am not afraid that you are not democratic, and I insist on being the master. "Long-term coexistence and mutual supervision," I will stand in the position of the master to supervise your sectarianism and dogmatism in order to jointly build a socialist society. Dogmatism and sectarianism cannot withstand struggle. With the people opposing below and the Party Central Committee supervising above, they will be overthrown after a few rounds. Of course, these are still internal contradictions among the people, and should be struggles in the form of gentle breeze and drizzle. As for serious bureaucrats who act arbitrarily, I do not advocate that the form of great democracy should absolutely not be used to deal with them.

In this way, with the efforts of both sides, the Party in universities should strive to become the "confidant" of intellectuals as soon as possible, and intellectuals should advance from the mercenary consciousness of "a scholar dies for his confidant" to the thought of the master of "not shirking responsibility" as soon as possible, improve the relationship between the Party and the masses in universities, and jointly build a socialist society. I believe that this day will inevitably come, and will come in the near future.

As for the fact that the relationship between the Party and the masses in universities is not completely harmonious, the Party should bear absolutely more responsibility, which need not be said much here.

### 党要作知识分子的“知己”

    党要作知识分子的“知己”
    北京师范大学教授　王真
    党要作知识分子“知己”，给知识分子以正确评价；知识分子要从“士为知己者用”的雇佣思想进步到“当仁不让”、建设社会主义人人有责的主人翁思想
    在高等学校中，党和高级知识分子的关系还是不够融洽的，少数知识分子甚至对党还有严重的对立情绪。造成这种情况的原因很多，但从高等学校党方面来说，其中一个最重要的原因，是党还不善于作高级知识分子的“知己”、“知心”朋友，从“知己”、“知心”的地位来领导和帮助知识分子前进。
    中国知识分子有“士为知己者用”，“士为知己者死”，报“知遇之恩”的数千年传统思想。从这个意义上说，在高等学校，党是还没有能够作为高级知识分子的“知己”、“知心”的。这中间原因很多，首先是高等学校的党员，对知识分子所从事的专业不熟习，不了解其中甘苦，不能对其专业，予以正确评价。高等学校的党员大致可以分成两部分，一部分是老革命干部，他们过去忙于对敌斗争，有的人从没有深入学习自然科学和历史文化知识的机会；有的人过去虽然学习过，但在长期对敌斗争中，也逐渐生疏和荒废了。因此，他们不能从知识分子的专业水平，从他们的工作质量来了解他们，从而给予他们以正确的评价。一部分是解放以后，从所在学校毕业的青年教师，这些人对高级知识分子说来，昨天还是他们的学生，当然他们是不可能很快完全认识先生的工作的。曾有过这样的事情，一位助教曾劝一位教授把他很多的书送去造纸，因为他认为这位教授的书都是过时的无用的。有的教授因为买了几本佛经被扣上封建思想帽子，并且在评薪时降了他一级（见4月24日人民日报，冯友兰先生的新风气和新努力一文）。不真正了解一个人的才能，当然不可能把这个人安排在适当的工作岗位上，自然也不可能是这个人的真正“知己”。从了解知识分子的德方面来说，我们也不是没有缺点的。一般说起来，高等学校高级知识分子历史和社会关系都是比较复杂的，我们往往不了解旧中国社会的复杂性和对高级知识分子的进步估计不足，因而往往扩大他们历史上的缺点，及现存的落后一面，对他们社会关系复杂大惊小怪；这样，自然不能对他们的德予以正确评价，当然也不可能安排他们在适当的工作岗位上，从这一点说来，我们也作不到知识分子的“知己”、“知心”。虽说我们党在帮助知识分子的马列主义学习上曾作了很大的努力，也取得了一定的成绩，但因为对知识分子所从事的业务不熟习，因而这种帮助便不能不陷于一般化，不能从他们的专业上提高他们的马列主义的水平，使他们把学得的马列主义应用在他们的专业上，所以这种工作是不深入的。
    在这种情况下，高等学校的党，在对知识分子的评价和工作安排上，一般说起来有两种方法，一种是走“群众路线”，这也是一种主要的方法。学校的重大措施，由校委会或其他群众性会议决定，例如评级问题，常常由教授们自己相互讨论决定初步意见，党的领导基本上按照他们的意见办理。这种办法，如果能在领导上不出大毛病，是可以解决问题和不发生问题的。但是，这种尾巴式的领导方法，决不可能使高级知识分子感觉到党是他们的真正“知己”，也不可能使党在他们中建立真正的威信，而且这种方法也不可能给予每一个知识分子以正确的评价，使学校措施获得大家真心的同意。例如有的教授曾公开提出学校领导只是根据群众的常识或者感性认识就作出重大的决定。这种领导方法，又往往表现为对高级知识分子过多的生活上照顾与在日常生活接触上形式上的尊重，表现为恭恭敬敬客客气气。其实具有真才实学的知识分子最关心的是人们对他的专业尊重，对他们专业的正当评价。仅只物质生活上的照顾而不能真正了解他们的专长，他们是会感觉到“怀才不遇”，无“知己”、“知心”的寂寞与悲哀的。一种方法就是凭主观行事，自己不懂，反以为自己了不起，教条主义、宗派主义支配着自己，说这个人也不行，那个人也不行，“一朝权在手，便把令来行”，动不动给他人无情打击，使对方噤若寒蝉不敢鸣不肯鸣，像上边所说的，因为某教授买了几本佛经就予以降级减薪。这自然会引起若干知识分子对党的不满而在情绪上对立起来。又如很多高等学校的党因为不知道教学中的甘苦，在高教部、教育部指示下，强迫在教师中实行工作量制度，结果因为行不通只好作罢。所以这个问题的彻底解决，必须加强高等学校党的力量，给党员钻研业务的时间，使党员能成为红色专家，同时吸收高级知识分子中的进步人士入党，以便党能成为知识分子的知己，能真正领导高等学校的知识分子。当然更重要的是改正教条主义和宗派主义，因为不去掉这些歪风，不仅严重的妨碍了党和知识分子团结，而且也使他们自己不能进步，从不懂变成真懂，从一知半解变为红色专家。只有在高等学校具有了成批的真正的红色专家，党才能真正领导高级知识分子一齐前进。
    上边说的，是从党方面讲的，另外，从知识分子方面说来，也不是不应该有改进的地方。“士为知己者用”，“士为知己者死”，报“知遇之恩”的思想，从某种意义上说来，这是十足的雇佣观点，这是和人民民主政权作为国家主人翁地位十分不相称的。中国知识分子的历史传统，除上边所说的外，也有另一种优良的历史传统，这就是要有“立灭国，继绝世，为天地立心，为生民立命”的伟大抱负，这就是“当仁不让”，“国家兴亡，匹夫有责”的主人翁的自觉感。党是我的“知己”固然好，我愿在党的领导下，同党一起共同建设社会主义社会，党不是我的“知己”，我也要争取党成为我的“知己”；不是什么“苟全性命于乱世，不求闻达于诸侯”、“独善其身”的消极态度，而应当是：“兼善天下”、“毛遂自荐”，“三月无君则皇皇如也”以求同志找知己来共同建设社会主义社会。对于宗派主义者、教条主义者也好办，那就是继承知识分子的另一种优良传统，“不畏强梁”，“威武不能屈”，“士可杀，不可辱”，对他们进行斗争。你教条主义者不许我鸣，我偏要鸣，你宗派主义者排挤我不在你的民主范围之内，我偏不怕你不民主，硬要作主人翁。“长期共存，互相监督”，我就要站在主人翁的地位来监督你的宗派主义和教条主义，以利于共同建设社会主义社会。教条主义和宗派主义是经不起斗争的，下有人民反对，上有党中央监督，经不起几回合就会被打下台去的。当然，这些还是人民内部矛盾问题，应该是和风细雨方式的斗争。至于对严重的作威作福的官僚主义，我不是主张绝对不能用大民主形式来干一下。
    这样，由双方努力，高等学校党要尽快地争取成为知识分子的“知己”，知识分子要由“士为知己者用”的雇佣意识尽快地进步到“当仁不让”的主人翁的思想，改善高等学校党群关系，来共同建设社会主义社会。我相信这一天是必然会到来的，而且会在最近的将来到来的。
    至于高等学校党群关系不尽融洽，党应负绝对的更多的责任，这里是不用多说的。
