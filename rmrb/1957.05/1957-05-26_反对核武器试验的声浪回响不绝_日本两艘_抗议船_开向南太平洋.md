Xinhua News Agency, May 25th: Tokyo dispatch: Two Japanese "protest ships" set sail from Uraga Port at the mouth of Tokyo Bay this morning, heading for the South Pacific region to protest British nuclear weapons testing.

　　The two ships flew large flags measuring fifteen feet long and three feet wide. The flags read: "Stop Nuclear Testing on the High Seas," "Immediately Halt Nuclear Testing," "Fishermen are Not Guinea Pigs for Nuclear Testing," "The High Seas are Our Workplace."

　　These two "protest ships" were dispatched by the Uraga Port seafarers' organization. This action was supported by the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs.

　　One of the ships is called "Koho Maru," weighing 99 tons; the other is called "Ryoei Maru," weighing 180 tons. "Ryoei Maru" will go to the Marshall Islands area, and "Koho Maru" will go to the Indian Ocean area.

　　Korean Peace Organization Issues Statement

　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 25th: The Standing Committee of the Korean National Committee for the Defense of Peace held an enlarged meeting on May 24th and issued a statement opposing the use and testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons.

　　The statement said that the series of historic documents passed by the Berlin meeting of the World Peace Council have aroused resonance and sympathy among all well-meaning people. The Korean people will further strengthen united action with peace-loving people all over the world, denounce the US imperialist policy of preparing for atomic war, and wage a resolute struggle to prohibit the use and testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons.

　　The statement said that the Korean people warmly support and endorse the Third World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs to be held in Tokyo this August, and have decided to actively participate in the conference. The statement also urged the ruling groups of the United States and Britain to promptly accept the Soviet Union's legitimate proposal to stop the use and testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons.

　　The statement denounced the United States for openly plotting to abolish the armistice agreement in Korea, attempting to transport missiles into South Korea, and continuing to intensify the tense situation in Korea.

　　Hungarian People Launch Signature Campaign

　　Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, May 25th: In response to the call of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council in Berlin, the Hungarian people are actively launching a signature campaign to protest against nuclear weapons testing. The nationwide movement to ban nuclear testing is currently expanding.

　　The Hungarian National Peace Council has been continuously receiving a large number of letters and telegrams from people of all walks of life. They firmly demand the immediate cessation of testing and the prohibition of nuclear weapons.

　　The capital's newspapers on May 24th published a resolution of the Hungarian Catholic Bishops' Conference. The resolution hoped that all major countries and all responsible leaders of the United Nations would first take measures to completely eliminate and prohibit weapons of mass destruction.

　　Indian Council of States Passes Resolution

　　Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 25th: Following the House of the People, members of the Indian Parliament's Council of States unanimously passed a resolution on the afternoon of May 24th, requesting countries possessing nuclear weapons to suspend such tests before completely banning nuclear tests.

　　Prime Minister Nehru and Defense Minister Menon, in their speeches, emphasized the urgent need to immediately stop testing and ultimately completely ban nuclear weapons. Menon specifically pointed out that India opposes the so-called "restriction of testing and registration before testing" proposal put forward by Canada and Japan.

　　Since Britain exploded a hydrogen bomb on Christmas Island, the call for India's opposition to nuclear testing has become even louder. The recently established Indian Preparatory Committee for the International Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament has called for an "immediate cessation of experimental explosions." Among those who signed the appeal were Mrs. Rameshwari Nehru and prominent leaders of the Congress Party and the Communist Party.

    这两艘“抗议船”是浦贺港的海员组织派遣的。这个行动得到了日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会的支持。
    这两艘船一个叫“幸凤丸”，九十九吨；另一个叫“良荣丸”，一百八十吨。“良荣丸”要到马绍尔群岛一带，“幸凤丸”将到印度洋一带。

    声明说，朝鲜人民对今年8月将在东京举行的第三届禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会给予热烈的支持和声援，并且决定要积极地参加这个大会。声明并且要求美国和英国统治集团迅速接受苏联关于停止使用和试验原子武器和氢武器的正当建议。
    声明指责美国最近在朝鲜露骨地策划废除停战协定，企图把导弹运入南朝鲜，继续加剧朝鲜紧张局势的行为。
    匈牙利人民展开签名运动
    据新华社布达佩斯25日电　为响应世界和平理事会常务委员会柏林会议的号召，匈牙利人民正在积极展开抗议试验核武器的签名运动。目前全国禁止试验核武器的运动正在扩大中。

    尼赫鲁总理和国防部长梅农在他们的发言中强调迫切需要立即停止试验，并且最后完全禁止原子核武器。梅农特别指出，印度反对加拿大和日本提出的所谓“限制试验并且在试验前进行登记”的建议。
    自从英国在圣诞岛上爆炸氢弹以后，印度反对原子核试验的呼声更加高涨。最近成立的反对原子弹和氢弹、赞成裁军的国际会议印度筹备委员会已经呼吁“立即停止试验性爆炸”。在呼吁书上签名的有拉米希瓦里·尼赫鲁夫人以及国大党和共产党的著名领袖。
