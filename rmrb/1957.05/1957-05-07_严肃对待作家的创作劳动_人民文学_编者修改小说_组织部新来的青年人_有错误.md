    Seriously Treat Writers' Creative Labor
    "People's Literature" Editors Made Mistakes in Revising the Novel "The Young Man Newly Arrived at the Organization Department"

    (Our News) The Secretariat of the Chinese Writers Association recently held a symposium to discuss improving the editorial work of literary journals, strengthening the connection between editorial departments and writers, and focusing on discussing the errors made by the editors of "People's Literature" in revising the novel "The Young Man Newly Arrived at the Organization Department."

    It was recently discovered that Wang Meng's novel "The Young Man Newly Arrived at the Organization Department" was revised by the editorial department of "People's Literature" before publication. In addition to polishing the language, the revisions also involved the ideological content and character portrayals of the work. The ending of the novel was entirely rewritten by the editors. Some revisions were good, but some revisions made the shortcomings of the original work more prominent. The editorial department did not consult with the author before making the revisions, and the editorial department did not express its attitude in a timely manner after the novel was published and caused discussion. Speakers at the symposium all believed that this was an error in the work of the "People's Literature" editorial department and deserved to be taken as a lesson for all editorial departments to improve their work.

    Mao Dun said that to run a good publication, one must mainly rely on writers. The editorial department should serve the writers, be humble, and respect the writers' labor. At the same time, the editorial department should also be responsible to the readers; and the writers should also respect the editors. Revising manuscripts is a complex issue. Some people say, "Absolutely no word or sentence can be changed"; some people say, "It can be changed." In my opinion, the editor can only change typos and obviously incomprehensible sentences, but should not rashly modify the content of the original work. He said that the modification of "The Young Man Newly Arrived at the Organization Department" affected the characters in the original work without seeking the author's consent, which was wrong.

    Zang Kejia said: Writers are dissatisfied with the editorial department, primarily because the editors do not respect the writers' creative labor enough. He cited many examples. He said that some young comrades revise the articles of old writers, removing a "de" and adding a "le," thinking that it conforms to grammar, but in fact, it destroys the writer's style.

    Yan Wenjing said that disrespect for writers' labor is manifested in many aspects. For example, inappropriately rejecting manuscripts, rudely deleting and revising manuscripts, not emphasizing good articles, rigidly assigning topics for writing, and so on. He said that the editorial department and the writers are interdependent and contradictory. Although the problem involves both parties, to solve it properly, the editorial department should be required first. Because the editorial department holds the power of life and death over articles.

    In his speech, Wang Meng expressed his gratitude to the "People's Literature" editorial department for the encouragement and help it gave to his writing. However, he disagreed with some of the revisions made by the editorial department to the novel "The Young Man Newly Arrived at the Organization Department." He also criticized some editors for lacking a comradely attitude and having a commercial and江湖(Jianghu - underworld-like) atmosphere in organizing and processing manuscripts. When soliciting manuscripts, they say all the nice things; once the manuscript is in hand, their attitude changes.

    Qin Zhaoyang explained the process of the novel's revision. He admitted that after the revision, the author's original intention and the images of Lin Zhen and the district committee secretary were damaged, which aggravated the shortcomings of the work. He said, "This is a major mistake." This mistake shows that he "unconsciously developed a serious style of disrespect for writers and a sense of arrogance and complacency in the long-term work of revising manuscripts."

    Qin Zhaoyang suggested that in the future, manuscripts should be "responsible for their own writing." Except for asking the author to revise it himself, the editors should not make any changes. He said that only in this way can the author's labor be fully respected, and can it be in line with the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend."

    Xiao Qian said that editing work is a kind of backstage work, and editors are unsung heroes in the cultural undertaking. The "People's Literature" editorial department made revisions to "The Young Man Newly Arrived at the Organization Department," and this work, whether it was done appropriately or not, was within the scope of the editor's duties. However, there were also places where the editor's revisions went beyond the scope.

    Guo Xiaochuan said that the "People's Literature" editorial department has achieved results. It has published many works that have had an impact on society and cultivated many young authors. It should not be judged by the handling of one article. But overall, the relationship between literary journals and writers is not normal enough and needs to be adjusted. The revision of "The Young Man Newly Arrived at the Organization Department" had many good points, and many points that could or could not be changed, but overall, it highlighted the shortcomings of the original work. When society criticized the shortcomings of the novel, the "People's Literature" editorial department did not step forward and publicly state its responsibility, which was a mistake.

    Liu Baiyu said that the editorial department's revision of the work was well-intentioned, in order to improve the quality and level of the publication. However, he believes that we should start from the current actual level of creation. We should gradually improve through publication, encouragement, criticism, and help, rather than relying on the artificial method of a large number of deletions and revisions by the publication's editors to firmly maintain the improvement of quality and level. Also, when we say that publications should widely unite writers and publish works of various styles, we often encounter people who are afraid that a wide range of unity will reduce quality. If this is the case, no matter how good the intention is, it is actually very dangerous. Because this is not conducive to widespread unity and letting a hundred flowers bloom. He believes that the proper way to improve the level of the publication should be to widely unite new and old writers. He believes that in the face of the new great changes, we should resolutely overcome subjectivism, bureaucratism, and sectarianism in our work, not be afraid to expose shortcomings, but must correct them, and run the publication well.

    At the symposium, representatives of the editorial departments of various literary and art publications in Beijing, Ge Luo ("People's Literature"), Wei Junyi ("Literary Study"), Ge Yang ("New Observer"), Chen Feiqin ("Liberation Army Literature"), Chen Bingyi ("Translation"), and Li Yuenan ("Beijing Literature"), introduced the difficulties and shortcomings in their editorial work, as well as the situation and problems of their editorial departments in implementing the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" and examining their relationship with writers.

    At the end of the symposium, Mao Dun once again emphasized that the editorial department must be careful and cautious when revising manuscripts, and the writers should also be considerate of the difficulties of the editorial work. In short, to strengthen the unity between the editorial department and the writers, it is necessary to "respect each other and understand each other."

### 严肃对待作家的创作劳动  “人民文学”编者修改小说“组织部新来的青年人”有错误

    严肃对待作家的创作劳动
    “人民文学”编者修改小说“组织部新来的青年人”有错误
    本报讯　中国作家协会书记处最近召开了座谈会，讨论改进文学期刊的编辑工作，加强编辑部门同作家之间联系的问题，并着重讨论了“人民文学”编者修改小说“组织部新来的青年人”的错误。
    最近发现，王蒙的小说“组织部新来的青年人”，在发表以前，是经过“人民文学”编辑部修改过的。除了文字润色以外，修改还涉及到作品的思想内容和人物形象。小说的结尾部分，全部经过编者改写。有些修改是修改得好的；但也有些修改使原作的缺点部分更加突出。编辑部在修改前并没有同作者商量过，小说发表后引起了讨论，编辑部也没有及时表示态度。座谈会的发言者都认为这是“人民文学”编辑部工作中的一个错误，并值得作为各编辑部改进工作的一个教训。
    茅盾说，要办好刊物，主要依靠作家。编辑部要为作家服务，要虚心，要尊重作家的劳动。同时，编辑部也要对读者负责；而作家也应该尊重编辑。关于修改稿件，是一个复杂的问题。有人说，“一定不能改动一字一句”；有人说，“可以改”。依我看来，编辑可以改的，只能是别字和显然不通的文句，而不可以轻率修改原作的内容。他说，对“组织部新来的青年人”的修改，牵动到原作的人物形象，而没有征求作者的同意，是不对的。
    臧克家说：作家对编辑部不满意，首先在编辑对作家的创作劳动不够尊重。他举了许多实例。他说，有些年轻同志改老作家的文章，去一个“的”字，加一个“了”字，自以为合乎文法，实际上破坏了作家的风格。
    严文井说，对作家劳动的不尊重，表现在许多方面。例如，不恰当地退稿，粗暴地删改稿件，好文章没有被强调，生硬地出题作文等等。他说，编辑部和作家是相依为命，而又互相矛盾。问题虽然涉及两方面，要妥善解决，首先应当要求编辑部。因为编辑部掌握着文章的生杀大权。
    王蒙在发言中向人民文学编辑部对于他的写作所给予的鼓励和帮助，表示感谢。但是他不同意编辑部对“组织部新来的青年人”这篇小说的某一些修改。他还批评有些编辑人员在组织稿件和处理稿件中，缺乏同志式的态度，有商人气，江湖气。约稿时，好话说尽；稿子一到手，态度就变了。
    秦兆阳说明了小说修改的经过。他承认，经过修改以后，作者的原意，以及林震、区委书记的形象，受到了损害，加重了作品的缺点。他说，“这是一个重大的错误。”这个错误说明了自己“在长期的改稿工作中，不知不觉地养成了一种严重的不尊重作家的作风，和骄傲自满情绪。”
    秦兆阳建议今后对稿件实行“文责自负”。除请作者自己修改外，编者一律不作改动。他说，只有这样，才能充分尊重作者的劳动，才符合“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针。
    萧乾说，编辑工作是一种后台工作，编辑人员是文化事业中的无名英雄。人民文学编辑部对“组织部新来的青年人”作了修改，这种工作不论做的确当与否，都是编辑分内的工作。但是编辑的修改也有超出范围的地方。
    郭小川说，人民文学编辑部的工作是有成绩的，它发表了很多在社会上有影响的作品，培养了不少青年作者，不能以一篇文章的处理，来衡量整个刊物。但目前整个说来，文艺刊物同作家之间的关系还不够正常，需要调整。“组织部新来的青年人”的修改，改得好的地方不少，可改可不改的地方很多，但整个说来，他突出了原来作品的缺点。当社会上对小说的缺点提出批评的时候，“人民文学”编辑部没有挺身而出，公开说明自己应当承担的责任，是一种错误。
    刘白羽说，编辑部修改作品，用意是好的，为了提高刊物的质量和水平。但他以为，应当从目前创作实际水平出发。经过发表、鼓励、批评帮助逐步提高。而不是靠刊物编辑大量删改的人为方法能够稳固地保持质量提高水平。还有当我们说到刊物要广泛团结作家，发表各种不同风格作家作品时，也常常逢到有人怕：一广泛团结就会降低质量，如果这样，尽管用心再好，实际却是很危险的。因为这是不利于广泛团结，百花齐放的。他认为提高刊物水平的正当途径应当是，广泛团结新老作家。他认为在新的伟大变革面前，应坚决克服工作中的主观主义、官僚主义、宗派主义，不怕暴露缺点，而一定纠正缺点，把刊物办好。
    在座谈会上，北京各文艺刊物编辑部的代表葛洛（“人民文学”）、韦君宜（“文艺学习”）、戈扬（“新观察”）陈斐琴（“解放军文艺”）、陈冰夷（“译文”）、和李岳南（“北京文艺”）分别介绍了编辑工作中的甘苦和缺点以及他们所在的编辑部贯彻“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针和检查同作家的关系的情况和问题。
    座谈会结束时，茅盾再一次强调说，编辑部修改稿件，一定要细心、慎重，而作家也要设身处地的多体谅编辑工作的困难。总之，要加强编辑部同作家之间的团结，需要作到“互相尊重，彼此了解”。
