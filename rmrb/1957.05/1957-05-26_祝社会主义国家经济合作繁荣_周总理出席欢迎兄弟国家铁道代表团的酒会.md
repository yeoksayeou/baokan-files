Xinhua News Agency, May 25th. Premier Zhou Enlai attended a reception today hosted by Minister of Railways Teng Tai-yuan to welcome delegates from various countries to China to participate in the Ministerial Conference of Socialist Countries in charge of Railways, which is about to be held in Beijing, and to celebrate the success of the International Railway Passenger and Freight Transportation Agreement Representative Conference.

　　In his speech, Premier Zhou first congratulated the prosperity of economic cooperation among socialist countries. Premier Zhou said that while the delegations from various countries came to China, the Chinese people are widely discussing how to correctly handle contradictions among the people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. China's policy in dealing with this issue is to proceed from the desire for unity, to reach new unity on a new basis through criticism. He hoped that representatives of brotherly countries could go to various places to see the discussion in person; if they are interested, they can also study this issue.

　　Premier Zhou also suggested that representatives from brotherly countries who came to participate in the two conferences could stay in China for a longer period and see more places, not only big cities, big factories or the Yangtze River Bridge, but also hoped that the representatives would see small towns and rural areas and other economically backward places, so that they can get a comprehensive impression of China.

　　Minister Teng Tai-yuan and Delangekiewicz (Poland), Director of the International Passenger Transport Agreement and International Railway Freight Transport Agreement Bureau, also delivered speeches at the reception. They said that agreements have been reached on many major issues in international railway passenger and freight transport during the past two weeks of meetings. They all congratulated the development of the railway intermodal transport of socialist countries.

　　The reception was attended by representatives from Albania, Bulgaria, Hungary, the Vietnam Democratic Republic, the German Democratic Republic, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Mongolia, Poland , Romania, the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia and the envoys of these countries to China. Representatives from Yugoslavia who were invited to attend the conference and the Yugoslav Ambassador to China also attended the reception.

    祝社会主义国家经济合作繁荣
    周总理出席欢迎兄弟国家铁道代表团的酒会
    新华社25日讯　周恩来总理今天出席了为欢迎来中国参加即将在北京举行的社会主义国家主管铁道部长会议的各国代表和庆祝国际铁路客货联运协定代表大会成功的酒会。酒会是由中国铁道部部长滕代远主持的。
    周总理在讲话中首先祝贺社会主义国家经济合作的繁荣。周总理说，在各国代表团来到中国时，中国人民正在中国共产党领导下广泛讨论如何正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题。中国处理这个问题的方针是从团结的愿望出发，经过批评，在新的基础上达到新的团结。他希望各兄弟国家的代表们能够到各地亲自看一看讨论的情况；如果有兴趣的话，还可以研究研究这个问题。
    周总理还建议来参加两个会议的各兄弟国家的代表们能在中国多逗留一个时期，多看一些地方，不仅要看大城市、大工厂或长江大桥，也希望代表们看看小城镇和农村等经济落后的地方，这样才能对中国得出一个全面的印象。
    滕代远部长和国际旅客联运协定、国际铁路货运协定事务局局长德郎日结维奇（波兰）都在酒会上致词，他们说，在过去两个星期的会议中，对于国际铁路客货运中的许多重大问题，已经达成了协议。他们都祝贺社会主义国家铁路联运事业的发展。
    参加酒会的有阿尔巴尼亚、保加利亚、匈牙利、越南民主共和国、德意志民主共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、蒙古、波兰、罗马尼亚、苏联、捷克斯洛伐克的代表和这些国家驻中国的使节。应邀参加这次会议的南斯拉夫的代表和南斯拉夫驻中国的大使也出席了酒会。
