Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 20th: The Soviet government announced on May 20th the text of a letter from Soviet Council of Ministers Chairman Bulganin to French Premier Guy Mollet, dated May 17th. In the letter, Bulganin, in the spirit of frankness from their meeting in Moscow last year, clarified the Soviet view on a number of major international issues and explored possible ways to improve Soviet-French relations.

In the letter, Bulganin pointed out that the Soviet government firmly believes that countries should not be divided into blocs on the issue of defending peace and preventing the danger of war. Countries may have different views on certain international issues, and countries with different social systems may have, and indeed inevitably will have, ideological differences. But all this does not mean that agreement cannot be reached on the main issue of defending peace and preventing the outbreak of a new war.

The letter pointed out that in the current situation, implementing the agreement reached last year on developing and improving Soviet-French relations would be of great significance for both the Soviet Union and France, and for consolidating peace in Europe. On a number of key issues in current international relations, the interests of the Soviet Union and France are not divergent.

Bulganin then discussed these issues. First is the issue of European security. Bulganin said that the only way to bring about a truly normal situation in Europe is to eliminate the current state of division in Europe into military blocs, with all European countries working together to ensure European security, regardless of their social systems, and regardless of whether they are today so-called "Western" or "Eastern" countries.

He pointed out that initially, the aim should be only to solve problems partially. The Soviet Union has repeatedly suggested that members of the North Atlantic Alliance and members of the Warsaw Treaty conclude a non-aggression treaty. Bulganin suggested that if it is not yet possible to reach an agreement on the removal of all foreign bases from European countries, then we should begin to simultaneously reduce the troops of the United States, Britain, and France stationed in the territory of NATO member states, and the troops of the Soviet Union stationed in the territory of Warsaw Treaty member states. He also stated that the Soviet Union is willing to discuss with the countries concerned the issue of establishing zones for limiting and monitoring armaments in Europe (including both parts of Germany and the territories of countries adjacent to them).

Bulganin believes that it would be quite natural for the Soviet and French governments to take the initiative to formulate the basic principles of a European security system through preliminary bilateral consultations. He said that consultations could be held now through normal diplomatic channels.

Bulganin then spoke about the issue of disarmament. He referred to the new proposals put forward by the Soviet Union to the Disarmament Subcommittee on March 18th and April 30th, and stressed that these proposals could serve as the basis for reaching an agreement on disarmament, including the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons, the elimination of such weapons from national arsenals, the destruction of existing stockpiles, and the substantial reduction of troops and armaments.

Bulganin suggested that an agreement should be reached immediately on a complete cessation of nuclear weapons tests, or at least a temporary cessation of such tests, and believes that there is no fundamental reason why it is currently impossible to reach an agreement on the solution of this issue.

Regarding the situation in the Middle East, Bulganin said that France's interests, like those of the Soviet Union, require the normalization of the situation in this region. The conditions for this can be created, as long as the major powers—the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council—can undertake certain obligations, such as those listed in the draft "Basic Principles of the Declaration of the Governments of the Soviet Union, France, the United States, and Britain on Peace and Security in the Near and Middle East and on Non-Interference in the Internal Affairs of the Countries of this Region" proposed by the Soviet Union on February 11th. As for France's economic interests in this region, they should not be resolved by the use of force, but through the development of normal economic and trade relations between countries.

Regarding the Algerian issue, Bulganin said that the more France delays the solution of the Algerian issue, the greater the losses it will suffer, and the only ones who will benefit are those who, for their own self-interest, are trying to get their hands on the rich resources of North Africa.

Finally, Bulganin discussed certain issues relating to direct Franco-Soviet relations. He pointed out that certain tensions arose in Franco-Soviet relations last autumn, for which the Soviet Union cannot be held responsible. He suggested taking some new measures to increase Franco-Soviet trade, such as holding chambers of commerce meetings in Moscow and Paris, regularly holding national industrial and agricultural exhibitions in each other's countries, providing mutual assistance in the development of fuel and energy supplies, and providing economic and financial assistance. He also suggested that the two countries cooperate in the use of atomic energy.

Bulganin concluded by suggesting that representatives of the two countries meet recently in Moscow or Paris to draft a plan for further developing scientific, technological, and cultural exchanges, and to draft the text of the cultural cooperation agreement mentioned in the two governments' statement of March 1956.

    布尔加宁致函摩勒
    建议苏法协商促成欧洲安全体系
    主张马上就停止核武器试验达成协议
    新华社21日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科20日讯：苏联政府20日公布了苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁在5月17日给法国总理居伊·摩勒的一封信。布尔加宁在信中本着双方去年在莫斯科会谈时的坦率精神，阐明苏联对一些重大的国际问题的观点，并且探讨改善苏法关系的可能的途径。
    布尔加宁在信里指出，苏联政府深信，在保卫和平和防止战争危险的问题上，不应该把各国分成阵营。各国在某些国际问题上可能有不同的见解，社会制度不同的国家之间可能有、甚至不可避免地会有意识形态上的分歧。但是这一切并不是说，就不能在保卫和平和制止发动新战争这个主要的问题上取得协议。
    信中指出，在目前情况下，实现去年达成的关于发展和改善苏法关系的协议，对于苏法两国，对于巩固欧洲和平，会有极重大的意义。在当前国际关系的一些主要问题上，苏法两国的利益是没有分歧的。
    布尔加宁接着谈到这些问题。首先是欧洲安全问题。布尔加宁说，使欧洲处于真正正常的情况的唯一途径，是消除欧洲目前分裂成军事集团的状态，一切欧洲国家共同努力保证欧洲安全，而不问它们的社会制度如何，不问它们今天是所谓“西方”的还是“东方”的国家。
    他指出，开始的时候应该只求局部地解决问题。苏联曾经不止一次地建议北大西洋联盟成员国和华沙条约成员国缔结一项互不侵犯条约。布尔加宁建议，如果现在大家还不能就撤除欧洲各国境内的一切外国基地达成协议，那就应该着手同时裁减美、英、法三国驻在北大西洋公约组织成员国境内和苏联驻在华沙条约成员国境内的军队。他还表示，苏联愿意同有关国家讨论关于在欧洲设立限制和监察军备区（其中包括德国两部分以及同它们相邻的国家的领域）的问题。
    布尔加宁认为，苏法两国政府如果主动通过初步的双边磋商拟定欧洲安全体系的基本原则，那是十分自然的。他说，现在就可以通过一般的外交途径来协商。
    布尔加宁接着谈到裁军问题。他提到苏联在今年3月18日和4月30日向裁军小组委员会提出的新建议，并且强调指出，这些建议可以作为就裁减军备问题达成协议的基础，其中包括禁止原子武器和氢武器、从各国军备中清除这种武器、销毁现有的储藏、以及大量裁减军队和军备。
    布尔加宁建议马上就完全停止核武器试验或者至少暂时停止这种试验达成协议，并且认为没有什么根本理由使得目前不可能就这个问题的解决达成协议。
    关于中东局势，布尔加宁说，法国的利益也同苏联的利益一样，要求这一地区的局势正常起来。这方面的条件是可以造成的，只要各大国——联合国安理会的常任理事国——能够承担某些义务，如像苏联2月11日提出的“苏联、法国、美国和英国政府关于中近东和平与安全以及不干涉这一地区各国内政的声明的基本原则”草案中所列举的一些义务。至于法国在这一地区的经济利益问题，不应当使用武力来解决，而应当通过开展国与国之间正常经济联系和贸易联系的方法来解决。
    关于阿尔及利亚问题，布尔加宁说，法国越是拖延阿尔及利亚问题的解决，它所蒙受的损失也将越大，得到便宜的只是那些为了一己的利益而企图染指北非富源的人。
    最后，布尔加宁谈到了法苏直接关系的某些问题。他指出，去年秋季法苏关系上发生了某些紧张因素，这是苏联不能负责的。他建议采取某些新的措施增加法苏贸易，诸如在莫斯科和巴黎举行商会会议，彼此经常在对方国内举办本国的工农业展览会，在发展燃料和动力供应方面互助，给予经济财政援助等。他还建议两国在利用原子能方面合作。
    布尔加宁最后建议，两国代表最近在莫斯科或巴黎会晤，以草拟进一步发展科学技术和文化交流的计划，并且草拟两国政府1956年3月声明中提到的文化合作协定的约文。
