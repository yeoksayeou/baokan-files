Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 9th: Xie Fuzhi, First Secretary of the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman of the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), spoke on the correct handling of internal contradictions in border ethnic minority areas and the Communist Party's rectification campaign at a symposium of the Third Plenary Session of the First Yunnan Provincial Committee of the CPPCC on the 7th.

Xie Fuzhi said that for a long time, three types of contradictions have existed in Yunnan Province concerning ethnic minority issues: contradictions between various ethnic groups and imperialism; contradictions between various ethnic groups, especially with the Han people; and class contradictions within various ethnic groups.

Xie Fuzhi said: "The main contradiction existing in ethnic issues currently is the contradiction between the various fraternal ethnic groups and the Han people. On the one hand, it must be acknowledged that after several years of work, unprecedented unity and progress have been achieved among the various ethnic groups, and the existing ethnic contradictions are not yet very serious. On the other hand, it should also be noted that the bureaucratic, subjectivist, and sectarian work styles of some Communist Party members and Han cadres working in the border ethnic minority areas have developed quite seriously. These errors are reflected in ethnic relations as Han chauvinism. Therefore, opposing bureaucratic and sectarian work styles, helping all fraternal ethnic groups to fully manage their own affairs, and ensuring that ethnic minority cadres truly have position, power, and responsibility are the main problems at present and the main problems to be solved by the rectification movement that will soon be launched in ethnic minority areas."

Speaking about the rectification campaign, Xie Fuzhi said that the success or failure of the rectification is not only a matter of the progress of Communist Party members but also will have a great impact on the socialist construction cause of all ethnic groups. Therefore, in the rectification movement, criticism and assistance from the masses of all ethnic groups, cadres of all ethnic groups, and public leaders of all ethnic groups are urgently needed. He repeatedly emphasized: Openly and frankly criticizing the shortcomings of the Party in various tasks in the spirit of saying everything we know is the greatest help to the Party's rectification movement.

    切实做到民族干部有职有权
    谢富治谈民族地区整风的重点
    据新华社昆明9日电　中共云南省委第一书记、政协云南省委员会主席谢富治，7日在政协云南省一届三次全体会议的一次座谈会上，就正确处理边疆民族地区内部矛盾和共产党的整风问题讲了话。
    谢富治说，长期以来，云南省在边疆民族问题上存在着三种矛盾，这就是：各民族与帝国主义之间的矛盾；各民族之间、尤其是与汉族之间的矛盾；各民族内部的阶级矛盾。
    谢富治说：“当前在民族问题上存在的主要矛盾，是各兄弟民族与汉族之间的矛盾。一方面要承认，经过了几年的工作，各民族之间已经取得了空前的团结和进步，现存的民族矛盾并非已经十分严重。另一方面也应当看到，在边疆民族地区工作的一些共产党员和汉族干部的官僚主义、主观主义和宗派主义作风已经发展得相当严重。这些错误反映在民族关系上，就是大汉族主义。因此，反对官僚主义、宗派主义作风，帮助各兄弟民族做到完全由自己当家作主，使民族干部切实做到有职有权有责，是当前的主要问题，也是即将在民族地区展开的整风运动所要解决的主要问题。”
    谈到整风问题时，谢富治说，整风进行得好坏，不仅是关系到共产党员进步的问题，而且将对各族人民的社会主义建设事业产生很大的影响。因此，在整风运动中就迫切需要来自各族群众、各族干部和各族公众领袖人物的批评和帮助。他一再强调地指出：本着知无不言的精神开诚布公地批评党在各项工作中的缺点，就是对党的整风运动的最大的帮助。
