Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 21st: The Soviet Union's spring planting work this year is nearing completion. As of mid-May, approximately ninety million hectares of spring crops have been sown. Grain sowing has been completed in Ukraine and the Volga River region, and grain sowing in the vast reclaimed areas of Kazakhstan is also nearing completion. The sowing of cotton, sugar beets, and sunflowers has been fully completed.

This spring in the Soviet Union, the weather has been warm, with ample rainfall and particularly many sunny days, making the spring planting work in many areas much faster than last year. By May 10, collective farms in Ukraine had sown over 12.4 million hectares of spring crops, 3.3 million hectares more than in the same period last year.

Currently, not only are winter crops growing well, but newly sown spring crops are also sprouting and growing vigorously. News from various regions indicates that wheat in the Caucasus region is already flowering, winter wheat in Kuban is beginning to head, corn in Central Asia is already up to ten feet tall in some areas, and spring wheat in Ukraine has sprouted.

The Soviet Union's goal in agriculture this year is to strive for a general upsurge in production in all agricultural sectors, making this year a year of great transformation. Last year, the Soviet Union's grain harvest increased by 50% compared to 1953; this year, efforts will be made to further increase production. In addition to continuing land reclamation, the main focus is on increasing yield per unit area.

    争取今年农业生产普遍高涨
    苏联春播接近完成
    据新华社莫斯科21日电　苏联今年的春播工作已经接近完成。截至本月中旬，已经播种了约九千万公顷的春播作物。乌克兰和伏尔加河流域的谷物已经播种完毕，哈萨克广大开垦地区的谷物播种工作也快要结束了。棉花、甜菜、向日葵的播种已经全部完成。
    苏联今年春天，气候温暖，雨量充足，晴朗的日子特别多，许多地区的春播工作比去年快得多。到5月10日，乌克兰的集体农庄播种的春播作物超过了一千二百四十万公顷，比去年同期多三百三十万公顷。
  现在，不仅冬播作物生长良好，就是刚播下的春播作物也健壮地茁芽生长。从各地传来的农事消息说，高加索地区的小麦已经扬花，库班的冬麦开始抽穗，中亚细亚地区的玉蜀黍有的已高达一丈，乌克兰的春麦已经长出幼芽。
    苏联今年在农业方面的目标是争取农业各部门生产得到普遍高涨。使今年成为大转变的一年。去年，苏联谷物的收获量比1953年增加了50％；今年还要争取进一步提高产量。除了继续开荒外，主要是提高单位面积的产量。
