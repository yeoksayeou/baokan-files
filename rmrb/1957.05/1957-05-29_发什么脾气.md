    What's There to Get Angry About?
    Li Budiao

    U.S. Representative John Vorys of the House Foreign Affairs Committee was enraged by anti-American demonstrations held by the people of Taiwan. He said viciously: "This really makes me angry. I think they had better make things clear. I don't see what reason they have to protest. The Chinese had better not throw tantrums."
    It seems that, relying on the few stinking dollars the United States has plundered from around the world, this congressman really wants to monopolize everything in the world, even the right to be angry. American soldiers kill Chinese people in Taiwan, and the Chinese shouldn't get angry; instead, this American congressman should get angry.
    Who is Vorys getting angry at? Is it at the Chinese people in Taiwan? If Vorys is a "good man" defending America's right to kill, and truly believes in America's "deterrent force," he had better come out of his office in Washington, go to Taiwan, and try to get angry in the face of the Taiwanese people. Fortunately, the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group in Taiwan has plenty of hospitals. Even if his head gets a few cracks, as long as he saves his life, he can return to the United States with a head full of bandages and become a "hero" of colonialism.
    Vorys may not have that kind of courage. His anger is just a fit of hysteria from someone who's been slapped in the face. However, what he said clearly illustrates how the United States views those who accept American "aid."
    It must be admitted that Vorys's words are very concise, and there's not a single word of nonsense. He first declared that he was "angry." Then he explained that the reason he was "angry" was that the people of Taiwan hadn't "made things clear." On what issue should they "make things clear"? Vorys thinks it's unnecessary for him to explain; everyone should already know. Another U.S. Senator, George Smathers, was more straightforward. He said that the United States had already given the Chiang Kai-shek group in Taiwan $3.5 billion in "military aid" and $775 million in "economic aid." In other words, the Chiang Kai-shek group is living on "American aid."
    Since they take American money, they have to be subject to American control. Whether to kill or scrape, it all depends on America's pleasure. For American colonialists, this is a matter of course. Therefore, Vorys said that he couldn't see any reason for the people of Taiwan to protest because an American soldier killed a Chinese person. But the people of Taiwan insisted on protesting. Vorys then issued a threat in his last sentence: You had better not throw tantrums, or else...
    Vorys deserves to be a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. These four sentences eloquently illustrate America's policy toward Asian countries that accept "American aid." The reason why the United States abuses extraterritorial rights and kills people without paying for their lives in Japan and the Philippines can all be answered from these four sentences.
    However, Vorys forgot the most important point. That is, the people of Taiwan and the people of many countries in Asia oppose turning their land into American colonies. No matter how much money the United States spends, it will never be able to buy the people. As long as the United States forgets this point, its embassies in many places should be prepared to be smashed one day.
    The British "News Chronicle" made a few sarcastic remarks about the anti-American demonstrations by the people of Taiwan, which were somewhat reasonable. The newspaper said: "...Americans must understand that you cannot buy friends even with dollars.
      "Strength and influence are not qualities that are welcomed, and if you are too eager to see smiling faces—which is a weakness of the United States—you will not make much progress in international politics.
    "In the international arena, greatness has to be proved by its own record."
    Vorys would probably blush and get angry again after hearing these words.

### 发什么脾气

    发什么脾气
    李不雕
    美国众议院外交委员会委员约翰·伏利斯，因为台湾人民举行反美示威而激怒了。他恶狠狠地说：“这真使我发火。我想他们最好还是放明白些。我看不出他们有什么理由抗议。中国人最好还是别发脾气。”
    看来，凭着美国有几个从全世界剥削得来的臭钱，这位众议员真的想把天下一切事物，都由美国一手垄断起来，连发脾气的权利，也不例外。美国军人在台湾杀了中国人，中国人不应该发脾气，倒是这个美国议员应该来发脾气。
    伏利斯发脾气给谁看呢？给在台湾的中国人民看吗？如果伏利斯是条保卫美国的杀人权利的“好汉”，真正相信美国的“威慑力量”，他最好从他在华盛顿的办公室里走出来，跑到台湾去，面对着台湾人民，发发脾气试试看。好在在台湾的美国军事顾问团有的是医院。即使他的头上给打开了几条裂口，只要保住了性命，他带着一头的绷带，回到美国去还满可以成为殖民主义的“英雄”。
    伏利斯未必有这样的胆量。他的脾气，不过是一个吃了一巴掌的人的一阵歇斯底里的发作而已。然而，他说的那几句话，倒是很能说明美国对那些接受美国“援助”的人是怎样看待的。
    应当承认，伏利斯的几句话，说得很紧凑，可以说没有一句废话。他首先声明他“发火”了。接着说明使他“发火”的原因是台湾人民没有“放明白些”。在什么问题上“放明白些”呢？伏利斯认为用不着他加以说明，大家就该知道的了。另一位美国参议员乔治·斯马特斯比较爽快些。他说，美国已经给了在台湾的蒋介石集团三十五亿美元的“军事援助”和七亿七千五百万美元的“经济援助”。换句话说，蒋介石集团是靠“美援”在活命的。
    既然拿了美国的钱，就得服美国的管。要杀要刮，就都得看美国的高兴。对于美国殖民主义者来说，这是天经地义的事情。因此，伏利斯就说，他看不出台湾人民有什么理由因为美国军人杀了一个中国人而抗议。可是台湾人民偏偏要抗议。伏利斯就用最后一句话提出了威胁：你们最好还是别发脾气，否则……
    伏利斯不愧为众议院外交委员会的委员。他这四句话，颇为精采地说明了美国对于接受“美援”的亚洲国家的政策。美国之所以在日本、菲律宾滥用治外法权、杀人不肯偿命，都可以从这四句话里得到解答。
    不过，伏利斯忘掉了最重要的一点。这就是，台湾人民和亚洲许多国家的人民，反对把他们的土地变成美国殖民地。无论美国出多少钱，它却永远收买不到人民。只要美国忘记了这一点，它在许多地方的大使馆就都要准备有被捣毁的一天。
    英国的“新闻纪事报”就台湾人民的反美示威说的几句风凉话，倒是有点道理的。这家报纸说：“……美国人必须明白，你们即使用美元也不能收买朋友。
      “实力和影响不是受人欢迎的品质，如果你太渴望看到笑脸——这是美国的一个弱点——你在国际政治上就不会取得很多的进展。
    “在国际上，伟大是要它自己的纪录来证明的。”
    伏利斯听了这些话，大概又要脸红脖子粗了。
