To Absorb Mass Opinion and Improve Sports Work
State Physical Culture and Sports Commission Invites People from Sports Circles in the Capital to Symposium

    This newspaper reports that the Chinese Communist Party’s Leading Group of the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission (SPSC) yesterday invited some sports professors and lecturers from universities and colleges in the capital to hold a symposium. At the meeting, everyone criticized the SPSC's bureaucracy, subjectivism, and sectarianism, and helped the SPSC Party Group to rectify its work style.
    Li Zhiqian, associate professor of Beijing Petroleum Institute, criticized the SPSC for its high-handed bureaucracy and detachment from the masses. He said: Shortly after liberation, the leading cadres of the SPSC were very approachable. They would greet us with smiles, but now that they have become "chiefs," they don’t even nod when they see us, and just walk away. The same is true in our work.
    Many people feel that the SPSC uses sports workers a lot, but shows little concern for them. Liu Guanjun, associate professor of Beijing Institute of Geological Exploration, said that we sports workers regard the SPSC as our second home, but we can’t get any warmth in this home. The SPSC only has various demands for us, but little care and training. Zhou Chunhong of Beijing Institute of Technology pointed out that the SPSC often issues urgent notices, asking us to report immediately as referees, but we come and go in a hurry, and there is never a summary of experience, so that the problems that occur in this competition still occur next time. How can the level of referees be improved in this way? The same is true when national teams go abroad. Except for the basketball team, which comes back to give some reports and publish some articles in the newspaper, the weightlifting, gymnastics, swimming, and other teams all close the door and summarize at home, and communicate within small circles.
    Many people also criticized the SPSC's subjectivism in its work. Liu Shiliang of Beijing Normal University pointed out that the SPSC's closed-door approach to formulating the Labor and Defense System projects does not take into account the domestic situation. Can projects such as shot put be promoted in rural areas? If some simple and inexpensive national-style projects are added to the Labor and Defense System projects, more people can be attracted to participate.
    Jin Deyao of Beijing University of Political Science and Law said that the SPSC often proceeds from dogma and subjectivism in learning from foreign advanced experience and training athletes. In basketball, the characteristic of Chinese athletes is agility, but when the national team encountered tall foreign centers in foreign competitions, after returning to China, they only paid attention to the height of the athletes in the development and training of athletes, and did not pay attention to developing our original advantages.
    Professor Song Junfu of Beijing Institute of Physical Education criticized the SPSC for neglecting mass sports and focusing on competition. He said that the SPSC neglects mass sports. When establishing sports associations throughout the country, the SPSC did not consider the specific situation at the time, and deployed them vigorously, requiring that a certain number be reached within a few days. The materials and figures reported by the lower levels seemed to have completed the task, but in fact, there were not many sports committees that played a role, and the problems of the sports associations piled up.
    Some people criticized the sectarianism existing in the SPSC in their speeches.
    Professor Song Junfu of Beijing Institute of Physical Education said that the SPSC feels that the old sports workers are useless. When work requires it, we are invited, but we are treated with great contempt. In various sports events, the referees are always led by the headquarters. If the referee's work does not meet the taste of the headquarters during the competition, they will be removed on the spot, which makes us referees shrink back, worry, and feel extremely nervous. Every time a delegation goes abroad, Party and League members are selected first, regardless of whether their professional level is high enough, and those masses with higher professional level cannot do anything even if they want to contribute more to the motherland.
    Li Zhiqian, associate professor of Beijing Petroleum Institute, said that once the SPSC wanted to transfer four excellent skaters to Harbin to study figure skating with Czechoslovak experts. Two of the four people who went there couldn't even skate on the outside edge, but they were sent there because they were Party and League members.
    Liu Guanjun, associate professor of Beijing Institute of Geological Exploration, said that when work requires it, we are asked to be referees, but when we are not referees, we can't even enter the gate of the gymnasium, let alone watch any games.
    Finally, Cai Shufan, vice chairman of the SPSC, welcomed the opinions raised by everyone. The Party Group of the SPSC will hold a second symposium on the 27th.

    吸收群众意见  做好体育工作
    国家体委邀请首都体育界人士座谈
    本报讯　中共国家体委党组昨日邀请了首都高等学校的部分体育教授、讲师举行座谈会。会上，大家对国家体委的官僚主义、主观主义和宗派主义提出了批评，帮助国家体委党组进行整风。
    北京石油学院李志强副教授批评了国家体委高高在上，脱离群众的官僚主义。他说：在刚解放不久，体委的领导干部很接近我们，看见我们有说有笑，可是现在成了“首长”以后，看见我们头也不点一下，扬长而去。在工作中也是如此。
    很多人感到国家体委对体育工作者是使用多，关怀少。北京地质勘探学院刘冠军副教授说，我们这些体育工作者将国家体委看成第二个家，可是在这个家里得不到一点温暖。国家体委对我们只有各种要求，但是关怀、培养却很少。北京工业学院周春鸿先生指出，体委常发出紧急通知，要我们马上报到担任裁判，可是来得匆匆，走也匆匆，从没有总结经验，以致在这场比赛中发生的问题，下一次还是发生。像这样做法怎能提高裁判水平呢？在国家队出国时，也是如此，除了篮球队回来作些传达报告、在报上发表一些文章外，举重、体操、游泳等队都关了门在家里总结，在小圈子内传达。
    对国家体委工作中的主观主义方面，很多人也提出了批评。北京师范大学刘世亮先生指出，国家体委在制订劳卫制项目中闭门造车，不考虑国内的情况，像铅球等项目在农村中能否推广？如在劳卫制项目中加入一些简单而不用花钱的民族形式的项目，这样便可以吸引更多的人来参加。
    北京政法学院金德耀先生说，国家体委在学习外国先进经验，训练运动员方面常是从教条和主观出发。在篮球运动中，中国运动员的特点是灵敏，但国家队在国外比赛时遇到了外国队高大的中锋，回国后在发掘和培养运动员方面便只注意了身材的高大，而不注意发扬我们原有的优点。
    对国家体委忽视群众性体育运动，偏重竞赛，北京体育学院宋君复教授提出了批评。他说，国家体委忽视群众性的体育运动。在全国范围内建立体育协会时，国家体委不考虑当时的具体情况，雷厉风行地布置下去，要在几天内达到多少数字，下面汇报上来的材料、数字看来也完成了任务，可是实际上起作用的体委没有几个，体协的问题堆成了堆。
    有些人在发言中批评了国家体委存在的宗派主义现象。
    北京体育学院宋君复教授说，国家体委觉得老的体育工作者不中用，当工作需要时把我们请来后，又对我们十分轻视。在各个运动会中，裁判员也总是由指挥部来领导，比赛中途如裁判员的工作不合指挥部的口味，就被当场撤掉，使得我们做裁判的缩手缩脚、顾虑重重、紧张万分。在每次代表队出国时，也是首先挑选党、团员，不管业务水平是否够得上，而那些业务水平较高的群众想为祖国多出点力也无可奈何。
    北京石油学院副教授李志强说，有一次体委要调四名优秀的滑冰运动员去哈尔滨向捷克斯洛伐克专家学习花样滑冰，去的四个人中有两个连外刃滑也不会，就因为他们是党团员，所以被派了去。
    北京地质勘探学院副教授刘冠军说，工作需要时找我们当裁判，不当裁判时连体育馆的门也不能进去，更谈不上看什么比赛了。
    最后，体委副主任蔡树藩对大家所提的意见表示欢迎。国家体委党组将在27日举行第二次座谈会。
