    Guangzhou Holds South China Art Exhibition

    (Our newspaper's dispatch) The South China Art Exhibition, sponsored by the Guangzhou Branch of the Chinese Artists Association, opened at the Guangzhou Cultural Park on May 1. This is the largest art exhibition in South China since liberation.

    The exhibition features 676 works by 388 artists from Guangdong, Guangxi, Hong Kong, and Macau in the past three years. Chinese paintings account for a considerable proportion of the exhibits, indicating that both new and old painters are actively engaged in sketching activities to reflect real life. In terms of printmaking, the forms of lithography, copperplate engraving, glass engraving, and plaster engraving have increased, and some excellent and delightful works have emerged. Among the sculptures, the work "Yearning for the Motherland, Missing Wife and Children" reveals the feelings of Kuomintang soldiers oppressed under the iron heel of Taiwan, longing for their families in their mainland hometowns, which is moving.

    There are also many excellent works in other watercolors, sketches, cartoons, comic strips, illustrations, posters, and New Year pictures.

    In short, this is an exhibition of works with quite rich content, diverse styles, and a sense of life. After the exhibition closes on the 20th, it will tour Nanning, Guilin, Shantou, Zhanjiang and other places. (Duo Wei) (Attached picture)

    广州举行华南美术展览
    本报讯　中国美术家协会广州分会主办的华南美术展览于5月1日起在广州市文化公园展出。这是解放以后华南规模最大的一次画展。
    展览会共展出包括广东、广西、香港、澳门四个地区，近三年来作者三百八十八人的六百七十六件作品。展品中国画在数量上占了相当多的比重，说明了新老画家为了反映现实生活而相当活跃的进行写生活动。版画方面增多了石版画、铜板画、玻璃刻、石膏刻等形式，出现了一些令人喜爱的优秀作品。在雕塑作品中，“怀祖国，念妻儿”的作品揭示了在台湾铁蹄下被压迫的国民党士兵怀念大陆家乡亲人的心情，是动人心弦的。
    其他在水彩、素描、漫画、连环画、插画、招贴画、门画等作品中，也有不少优秀作品。
    总之，这是一次内容相当丰富，风格也较多样，并具有生活气息的作品展览。展览会于20日闭幕后，将赴南宁、桂林、汕头、湛江等地巡回展出。（多韦）（附图片）
