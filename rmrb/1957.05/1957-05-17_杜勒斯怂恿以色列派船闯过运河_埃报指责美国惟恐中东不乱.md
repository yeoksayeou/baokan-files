Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 16th. Cairo newspapers on May 15th strongly condemned Dulles for creating new troubles in the Middle East.

　　"Al-Ahram" said: Dulles's claim that he would not oppose Israel sending "experimental ships" through the Suez Canal is encouraging Israel to fish in troubled waters.

　　The newspaper said that Dulles, as a "peaceful figure," should only announce the unfreezing of Egyptian funds frozen in the United States, rather than inciting Israel.

　　"Al Shaab" said that Dulles's remarks were "open incitement" and an attempt to create new troubles in the Middle East. The newspaper said that Dulles "seems to oppose the idea of bringing stability to the Middle East and opposes Egypt's trend of adopting development and construction policies."

　　"Al Goumhouria" questioned on the 14th why the United States maintains a hostile attitude towards Egypt. The newspaper said, "This practice of the United States confirms the accusation in European newspapers that the United States is attempting to 'replace the influence of European Western countries' in the Middle East."

    杜勒斯怂恿以色列派船闯过运河
    埃报指责美国惟恐中东不乱
    新华社开罗16日电　开罗报纸5月15日严词指责杜勒斯在中东制造新的麻烦。
   “金字塔报”说：杜勒斯宣称他将不反对以色列派“试验船”通过苏伊士运河是鼓励以色列混水摸鱼。
    这家报纸说，杜勒斯作为一个“和平人物”，只应该宣布把被冻结在美国的埃及资金解冻而不该煽动以色列。
   “人民报”说，杜勒斯的谈话是“公开的煽动”，企图在中东制造新的麻烦。这家报纸说，杜勒斯“似乎反对使中东达到稳定这个念头并且反对埃及采取发展和建设政策的趋势”。
   “开罗报”14日责问说，美国为什么对埃及保持着敌对态度。这家报纸说，“美国的这种做法证实了欧洲报纸的那种指责，就是说美国企图”在中东“代替欧洲的西方国家的影响”。
