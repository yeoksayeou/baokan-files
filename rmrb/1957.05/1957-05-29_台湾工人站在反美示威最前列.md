    Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, May 28th: According to Taiwan newspapers, Taiwan workers bravely participated in the patriotic anti-American demonstrations. Among the demonstrators who smashed the American "Embassy," the United States Information Service, and surrounded the Taipei City Police Headquarters, there were a large number of Taiwan workers, and many of them stood at the very front of the crowd.

    Judging from the identities of those killed and wounded in the anti-American demonstrations announced by the Taiwan police, workers accounted for the majority. The deceased, Wu Mentao, was a worker at the Taiwan Meteorological Institute. The seriously injured were mostly printing workers, factory workers, or shop assistants, as well as some cultural workers and students. Many workers were also slightly injured in the demonstrations.

    Many pedicab drivers bravely participated in the anti-American demonstrations. When the Chiang Kai-shek troops dispersed the demonstrators surrounding the Taipei City Police Bureau on the evening of the 24th, several pedicab drivers ultimately escorted several demonstrators who had been seriously injured by the police to the hospital.

    台湾工人站在反美示威最前列
    新华社香港28日电　据台湾报纸透露，台湾工人英勇地参加了反美爱国大示威。在捣毁美国“大使馆”、美国新闻处和包围台北市警察总局的示威群众中，都有数量很多的台湾工人，而且许多都站到群众的最前面。
    从台湾警方公布的在反美大示威中死伤者的身份看来，工人占了大多数。死者吴面涛是台湾气象所的工人。重伤者大部分是印刷工人、工厂工人或店员，还有一些文化工作者和学生。在示威中，还有许多工人被击轻伤。
    许多三轮车工人都英勇地参加了反美大示威，当24日晚上蒋军驱散包围台北市警察局的示威群众时，几个三轮车工人最后还把几个被警察击致重伤的示威群众护送到医院去。
