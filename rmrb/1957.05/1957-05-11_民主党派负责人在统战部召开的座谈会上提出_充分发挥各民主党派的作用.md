    Democratic Party Leaders Propose Fully Leveraging the Role of Democratic Parties at Symposium Held by the United Front Work Department
    (Our Newspaper) At the afternoon of May 10th, the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee invited responsible persons from various democratic parties and non-party democratic individuals to continue their symposium. Those who spoke at the meeting included Shao Lizi, Standing Committee Member of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang; Luo Longji and Shi Liang, Vice Chairpersons of the China Democratic League; Chu Tunan, Standing Committee Member; Wang Shao'ao, Vice Chairperson of the China Association for Promoting Democracy; Zeng Zhaolun, Standing Committee Member of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League; and Chen Mingshu, Standing Committee Member of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang. In addition, Zhang Zhizhong, Vice Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, was unable to attend due to illness and submitted a written statement.
    The Situation of Party Substituting for Government Below the County Level Needs to Change
    Shao Lizi talked about three issues at the meeting.
    First, Shao Lizi mentioned that in the past six months, the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee and local United Front Work Departments have provided a lot of assistance to the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang in its social liaison work. The number of people contacted has increased, and the number of members of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang has also increased. Among the social figures contacted by the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, many need to have their living and employment problems resolved. The Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang should contact them, and the government should also resolve these problems. How to solve their living and employment problems? He gave an example, saying, could we consider solving it through literacy work? If the social figures contacted by the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang can serve as literacy teachers and receive a certain remuneration each month, the problems of livelihood and career will be solved, and they will also be fulfilling their responsibility to socialist construction.
    Second, Shao Lizi talked about the relationship between the Party and the government. He said that the Party's leadership in government departments is best achieved through Party groups. After the Party group decides on all major issues, it is handed over to Party members to implement, so that it can be carried out. If the Party directly issues orders, it will be a little worse. Especially in the leadership organs below the county level, the problem of the relationship between the Party and the government is greater, mainly because the Party substitutes for the government. The county magistrate is generally not valued, while the county party committee has great power. The work of the various departments of the county people's committee is also not valued. All work is decided by the county party committee. It is necessary for the Party Central Committee and the provincial party committee to set up many working departments because of the heavy workload, but is this necessary at the county level? Of course, the organization of the county party committee still needs to exist, but the power should be placed in the county people's committee. The county party committee mainly promotes work, rather than issuing government orders.
    In the past, the Party Central Committee sometimes jointly issued instructions with the State Council, which of course played a great role. But could we consider issuing instructions separately in the future, with the State Council to the various government departments, and the Party Central Committee to the Party system?
    Improving the relationship between the Party and the government is important to make government departments truly take responsibility, which will only benefit the Party's leadership, not harm it.
    The third is the issue of mutual supervision. He said that mutual supervision has existed in the past, and that is criticism and self-criticism. Mutual supervision must first have people. There are many problems at the lower levels in the implementation of policies and guidelines. However, democratic parties have very few organizations at the lower levels. Shao Lizi advocated that if democratic parties discover any places with potential development targets, they should write letters to contact the local political consultative conference. The local political consultative conference is responsible for the education work of new members who join the democratic parties. Of course, not every democratic party needs to develop local organizations, but only those that have the conditions to do so.
    The Contradiction Between Long-Term Coexistence and Lack of Successors Needs to Be Resolved
    Luo Longji said in his speech that yesterday someone mentioned that democratic parties are not eyes and noses, but eyebrows. Eyebrows are dispensable.
    Why does this argument still exist today? This is because the theoretical publicity has not kept up since Chairman Mao put forward the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision." Therefore, at present, only Chairman Mao and some leading comrades of the Party have sufficient estimates of the role of democratic parties, while many people in the country, as well as many foreign friends, still underestimate it. He said that without the China Democratic National Construction Association, the transformation of private industrial and commercial enterprises might not have been carried out so quickly. The Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang has done a lot of work for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan. He believes that more publicity should be given to these facts.
    When talking about the conditions for realizing "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision," he said that for democratic parties and the Communist Party to coexist for a long time, we must first solve the problem of the long-term existence of democratic parties. Now some intellectuals are unwilling to join democratic parties, fearing that others will say they are "backward," and are willing to strive to join the Communist Party. Someone asked: Does joining a democratic party affect joining the Communist Party? If it does, then they will not participate. If the Party absorbs such people into the Party, it will not only affect the Party's prestige, but also inevitably make the people developed by the democratic parties all leftovers. The Communist Party develops among the workers and peasants, while the democratic parties cannot develop among the workers and peasants, mainly developing among the old intellectuals, and they are mostly people over the age of thirty or forty. This contradiction should be resolved as soon as possible, otherwise it will be difficult to coexist.
    He believes that to achieve mutual supervision, we must give democratic parties the conditions for convenient work. He said that now all democratic parties have participated in the government, but in the past, many major policy issues were often discussed within the leading party before being brought out for consultation. Therefore, he hopes that in the future, these issues should be discussed by the democratic parties at the same time as they are discussed within the Party, and the relevant parties should provide information and materials in advance. He said that this is a question of whether the democratic parties have a name or reality, and to make the consultation worthy of the name. For example, when the State Council plenary session discussed the science plan today, someone from the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee attended the meeting, and Premier Zhou said that those in charge of propaganda work from the various democratic parties should also participate. In addition, he talked about the fact that if we want the grassroots organizations of democratic parties to play a role, the division of labor between the Party and the government must be clear. Now, many things decided by the Party are not arranged downward through the administration, but through the Party system, which can only make the democratic party members who hold administrative positions feel that they have the position but no power.
    He believes that the equality, independence, and freedom between the Party and the democratic parties should be relative. In the past, the United Front Work Department had achievements in helping the work of democratic parties, but there may also be some deviations. Now, Minister Li said that "it is not afraid to overcorrect," which will cause many difficulties for the democratic parties. Therefore, this issue should be discussed further. On the other hand, to talk about equality, independence, and freedom, we should also create some conditions. Some systems and regulations now hinder the implementation of equality, independence, and freedom and the role of democratic parties. We hope to conduct inspections and revisions on these issues.
    The Basis of Long-Term Coexistence Does Not Lie in the Number of People
    Shi Liang said in her speech that she would first argue with Luo Longji. She believes that whether democratic parties can coexist with the Communist Party for a long time does not lie in the number of members of the democratic parties, but in whether the democratic parties can play a role in society. She believes that although the class represented by the democratic parties has been eliminated, the ideological consciousness of that class will still exist for a long time, which requires the existence of democratic parties to continue their work. If the members of the democratic parties and the masses they are in contact with have all raised their awareness and can all join the Communist Party, then there is no need for the existence of democratic parties, and everyone's thinking will be transformed very well, and the Communist Party can also be eliminated in the future. We cannot say that the Communist Party is developing fast, and the democratic parties cannot "exist for a long time," nor can we say that all intellectuals can only be members of the China Democratic League, and not being able to join the Communist Party is called "existing for a long time." Both of these views are incorrect.
    Then, she used her own experience to illustrate that even if you do not join the Communist Party, the Party still trusts you, and there is no so-called distrust of non-Party members, and she does not feel that she cannot play a role under the leadership of the Party. She said that only one thing is not very good, that is, I often have a dependence on the Party because I trust the Party, and I think that everything the Party decides is correct, and I cannot think independently. Now the Party advocates independent thinking, and everyone can think independently from different perspectives under the common goal of building socialism, and play their due active role.
    The issue of mutual supervision cannot be understood as only the supervision of the leading party by the democratic parties, which is also unequal. To be equal, there must be mutual supervision. Talking about rights and obligations is relative, and you cannot only have rights without fulfilling obligations. Democratic parties have the right to supervise, and also the obligation to be supervised.
    Shi Liang believes that all democratic parties should also participate in this rectification campaign, and through the rectification campaign, the democratic parties can become more united.
    Li Weihan made an explanation on this issue, saying that the rectification movement within the Communist Party has just begun, and in this rectification movement, we must focus on criticizing the shortcomings of the Communist Party. Therefore, we have already discussed with the various democratic parties and non-party democratic individuals that within a period of time, we should not call on the democratic individuals to rectify themselves, but focus on mobilizing non-party individuals to give criticism and suggestions to the Communist Party to help the Communist Party rectify itself.
    Leveraging the Role of Democratic Parties in Institutions of Higher Learning
    Chu Tunan spoke on how democratic parties can play a role in the cultural and educational circles, especially in institutions of higher learning. He said that members of democratic parties account for a considerable proportion in the cultural and educational circles, especially in institutions of higher learning, but they have not played the role they should play. The reason is that on the one hand, the democratic parties themselves do not provide enough education to their members, and on the other hand, the party and government leaders of various schools underestimate the role that democratic parties can play. The failure of democratic parties to fully play a role in institutions of higher learning is not only a loss for the democratic parties, but also a loss for the country. We hope that the United Front Work Department will study and solve this problem.
    In the past, members of democratic parties played a role in the adjustment of departments and faculties in institutions of higher learning. Today, they must also play a role in the march towards science. However, because they do not have enough contact with the propaganda departments of the party committees and the cultural and educational departments of the government, they cannot understand some guidelines and policies in a timely manner, and they cannot play the organizational role of democratic parties very well. This situation is better in Beijing, but worse in other places. We hope that we can link up with these departments in the future.
    Although the United Front Work Department has made arrangements for the full-time cadres of the grassroots organizations of democratic parties, such as participating in people's congresses at all levels, from the central government to the local governments, it has not done enough to cultivate and improve them, not only in terms of treatment. We hope to give them appropriate conditions and opportunities so that they can improve and establish contact with all parties. Don't make some comrades who work in democratic party organizations feel that they have done their work, but no one cares, no one knows, and they are doing "black market" work, so they are not at ease with their work.
    The "Wall" Between Party Members and Non-Party Members Needs to Be Dismantled on Both Sides
    Wang Shao'ao said that the wall between the Party and the democratic parties was not built by one side alone. Even if the Communist Party rectifies itself, the wall will not be completely dismantled.
    He then analyzed the reasons why this wall was built. The reason is that the language of people from the new society and people from the old society is different. Different languages easily lead to problems. For example, if someone calls a car driver a carter, it may cause a misunderstanding. Therefore, he said that to cooperate with non-Party members, we must first understand their language and habits. When you encounter misunderstandings like the one above, party members should sincerely tell the other party, and they will correct it in the future. However, some party members do not do this. If the other party says something wrong, they do not help to correct it, but instead record it in a notebook, and accumulate it over time, and when they have the opportunity, they will bring it all out to rectify people. Although some of them may have ideological problems, most of them are caused by the habits of the old society. He said that there are also different language habits within the Communist Party, such as those who came from Yan'an and those who have been working underground for a long time, which are sometimes not exactly the same. The above situation will be worse when encountering impatient people. There are impatient people both inside and outside the Party. Therefore, we must educate people on both sides in response to this situation. This is very important. Language habits seem like small things, but they have a big impact.
    Changing Some Outdated Systems Can Achieve Mutual Supervision
    Zeng Zhaolun focused on the issue of mutual supervision in his speech. He believes that the reason why democratic parties have not played a very good role is that on the one hand, they have not done their work well, and on the other hand, after the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" was put forward, some systems have not been changed and cannot adapt to the new situation. He mentioned that in the past, democratic parties participated in the discussion of the national system; members of democratic parties who worked in various fields also participated in the discussion of the system in various fields. However, for such a big issue, the Central Committee of the China Democratic League has never discussed it once. He felt that no one would object to the leading party discussing major national issues first; however, could the democratic parties participate in the discussion earlier and learn about the situation earlier?
    He also raised two other opinions.
    The first opinion is that he believes that the achievements of the Three-Anti and Five-Anti campaigns and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries were fundamental and primary, but also caused many side effects due to some shortcomings. The side effects of the "Three-Anti" campaign have not been completely eliminated even after five years. Would it be beneficial to the United Front Work if the government could find a way to eliminate them?
    The second opinion is: the opinions of members of democratic parties are easily reflected to the higher authorities, while the opinions of non-party democratic individuals are not easily reflected because there is no organizational system. Zeng Zhaolun said, is this considered a loophole in the United Front Work? He suggested that opportunities should be given to non-party democratic individuals to express their opinions in the future.
    It Is Very Meaningful for Party Members to Seek Friends and Teachers from Non-Party Members
    Chen Mingshu spoke last. He mentioned that some party member cadres in charge in the cultural and educational circles are not using their strengths, and this situation is particularly serious in institutions of higher learning. He hopes to conduct an in-depth investigation and re-adjust their work. He believes that the current practice of party members seeking friends and teachers from non-party members during the rectification period is a very meaningful thing from a national perspective.
    Four Suggestions on Improving the Relationship Between the Party and Non-Party Members
    The following is the written statement of Zhang Zhizhong, Vice Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, on the 10th:
    Minister Weihan: Regarding the relationship between the Party and non-Party members, I have already spoken at the CPPCC meeting. Among them, my suggestions are four points, namely (1) solving problems from an ideological understanding perspective; (2) seeking guarantees from the system; (3) cultivating feelings from life and interaction; (4) implementing policies by strengthening learning, strengthening propaganda and education, and strengthening inspection work; I hope you will consider these four suggestions. I have no other comments.

### 民主党派负责人在统战部召开的座谈会上提出  充分发挥各民主党派的作用

    民主党派负责人在统战部召开的座谈会上提出
    充分发挥各民主党派的作用
    本报讯　10日下午，中共中央统战部邀集各民主党派负责人和无党派民主人士继续举行座谈。在会上发言的有，中国国民党革命委员会中央常务委员邵力子，中国民主同盟副主席罗隆基、史良，常务委员楚图南，中国民主促进会副主席王绍鏊，中国民主同盟中央常务委员曾昭抡，中国国民党革命委员会中央常务委员陈铭枢等。另外，中国国民党革命委员会副主席张治中因病未能出席，作了书面发言。
    县级以下以党代政的情况需要改变
    邵力子在会上谈了三个问题。
    第一个问题，邵力子谈到，半年来，中央统战部和各地统战部门对民革的社会联系工作做了许多帮助，联系对象多了，民革会员也发展了不少。民革联系的社会人士中，有许多人需要解决生活和就业问题，民革不加以联系，政府也应予以解决。怎样解决他们的生活和就业问题？他举一个例子说，可不可以考虑从扫盲工作中解决。民革联系的社会人士如能担任扫盲教员，每月取得一定报酬，生活、职业问题解决了，也对社会主义建设尽了一分责任。
    第二个问题，邵力子谈的是党政关系。他说，党在政府部门的领导，最好是通过党组。一切重大问题，党组决定后，交由党员去运用，使能贯彻执行。如果直接由党发号施令，就会差一些。特别是县以下的领导机关，党政关系问题就较大，这主要是以党代政。县长，一般是不被看重的，而县委权力极大。县人民委员会各部门的工作同样不被看重。一切工作由县委决定。党中央、省委，因为工作繁重，下设许多工作部门，是有必要的，但县级是否有此必要？当然，县委的机构还是要存在的，但权力应该放在县人民委员会。县委主要是推动工作，而不是发布政令。
    在过去，党中央有时同国务院联合发布指示，当然起作用很大。但今后可否考虑分别发布指示，国务院向各政府部门，党中央向党的系统。
    改善党政关系，重要的是使政府部门真正负起责任来，这对党的领导只有好处，没有坏处。
    第三是关于互相监督的问题。他说，互相监督，过去也曾有的，这就是批评与自我批评。互相监督，首先要有人。在政策、方针执行中，下面的问题多。可是民主党派在下面很少有组织。邵力子主张民主党派如果发现甚么地方有发展对象，就写信向当地政协联系。参加民主党派的新的成员的教育工作，由当地政协来负责。当然，并不是每一个民主党派都需要发展地方组织，而是有条件的才去发展。
    要解决长期共存同后继乏人的矛盾
    罗隆基发言说，昨天有人提到，民主党派不是眼睛、鼻子，而是眉毛。眉毛是可有可无的。
    这种论调为什么至今还存在呢？这是因为，自从毛主席提出 “长期共存、互相监督”的方针后，理论宣传还没有跟上去。所以现在，只有毛主席和党中央的一些领导同志对民主党派的作用有足够的估计，而国内的许多人士，以及许多外国朋友，还是估计不足的。他说，对私营工商业的改造，如果没有民主建国会这个组织，就未必能进行得这样快。民革对和平解放台湾做了不少工作。对于这些事实，他认为要多作宣传。
    他在谈到实现“长期共存、互相监督”的条件时说，民主党派和共产党长期共存，首先要解决民主党派长期存在的问题。现在有些知识分子不愿意参加民主党派，怕别人说他“落后”，而愿意争取加入共产党。有人问：加入民主党派是否影响加入共产党，如果有影响，就不参加。党如果吸收了这样的人入党，不但影响党的威信，而且势必使民主党派发展的人都是挑剩下的。共产党在工农群众中发展，而民主党派就不能在工农群众中发展，主要在旧知识分子中发展，而他们多是三、四十岁以上的人。这个矛盾应该尽快解决，否则就很难共存下去。
    他认为，实现互相监督，要给民主党派以工作便利的条件。他说现在各民主党派都参加了政权，但是，过去有很多重大的政策问题，往往都是在领导党内讨论以后才拿出来协商。因此，他希望今后这类问题要在党内讨论的同时，也交民主党派去讨论，并由有关方面事前提供情况和资料。他说，这是民主党派有名有实，要使协商名副其实的问题。例如，今天国务院全体会议讨论科学规划时，中共中央宣传部有人参加会议，周总理说，各民主党派负责宣传工作的人也应该参加。另外他谈到，要想使民主党派的基层组织发挥作用，党政分工就要明确。现在，党决定的很多事情，都不通过行政而从党的系统向下布置，只能使担任行政工作的民主党派成员感到有职无权。
    他认为，党同民主党派之间的平等、独立、自由，应该是相对的。过去统战部在帮助民主党派工作方面是有成绩的，可能也有些偏差。现在，李部长说“矫枉不怕过正”，会使各民主党派遇到不少困难。因此，这个问题还应再作讨论。另一方面，要讲平等、独立、自由，也应该创造一些条件。现在有些制度、规章，有碍于平等、独立、自由的实行和民主党派作用的发挥。希望对这些问题进行检查、修改。
    长期共存的基础不在人数多少
    史良在发言中，首先表示她要和罗隆基争鸣一番。她认为民主党派能不能与共产党长期共存，并不在于民主党派成员人数的多少，而在于民主党派是否能在社会上发挥作用。她认为，民主党派所代表的阶级虽然消灭了，但那个阶级的思想意识仍然会在一个很长时期内存在，这就需要民主党派存在，继续进行工作。如果民主党派成员和所联系的群众觉悟都提高了，都可以加入共产党，那么民主党派也就没有存在的必要，大家思想都改造得很好了，将来共产党也可以消灭。不能说共产党发展快，民主党派就不能“长存”，也不能说所有的知识分子都只能是民盟的盟员，不能加入共产党才叫“长存”，这两种看法都是不对的。
    接着，她用她自己的体验来说明不参加共产党，党也是信任的，并不发生所谓对党外人士就不信任的问题，也没有感到在党的领导下不能发挥作用。她说，只有一点不大好，就是我常常由于相信党而产生依赖思想，认为党决定的都是对的，而不能独立思考问题。现在党提倡独立思考，大家就可以在建设社会主义这一个共同的目标下从不同的角度独立思考问题，发挥应有的积极作用。
    关于互相监督的问题，不能理解为只是民主党派对领导党的监督，这也是不平等。要平等，就得互相监督。讲权利义务是相对的，不能只有权利不尽义务，民主党派有监督的权利，也有被监督的义务。
    史良认为各民主党派也应该参加这次整风，通过整风可以使民主党派更加团结。
    李维汉就这个问题作了说明，他说，现在共产党内的整风运动刚开始，在这次整风运动中，要集中地批判共产党的缺点。因此，我们已经同各民主党派和无党派民主人士商量好，在一个时期以内，不要号召民主人士整风，而着重地发动党外人士来给共产党提批评意见，帮助共产党整风。
    发挥民主党派在高等学校中的作用
    楚图南就民主党派在文教界特别是在高等学校中如何发挥作用作了发言。他说，民主党派成员在文教界，特别是在高等学校，占相当大的比重，但是，并没有起到它应该起的作用。原因是一方面民主党派本身对成员的教育不够，另一方面是各学校党政领导上对民主党派能够发挥的作用估计不足。民主党派不能在高等学校充分地发挥作用，不但是民主党派的损失，而且是国家的损失。希望统战部研究解决。
    过去民主党派成员在高等学校的院系调整中起过作用，今天，向科学进军也要发挥作用。但是因为和党委的宣传部门、政府的文教部门联系不够，有些方针、政策问题不能及时了解，就不能很好的发挥民主党派的组织作用。这种情况在北京还较好，在地方上就差了。希望今后能够和这些部门挂起钩来。
    民主党派基层组织的专职干部，虽然统战部由中央到地方对他们都作了安排，如参加各级人民代表大会等。但是对他们的培养、提高做得不够，不仅是待遇问题。希望能够给以适当的条件和机会，使他们能够提高，能够同各方面取得联系。不要使有些在民主党派组织中工作的同志觉得自己工作做了，没有人关心，没有人知道，是做的 “黑市”工作，因而不安心工作。
    党与非党之间的“墙”要两方面来拆
    王绍鏊说，党与民主党派之间的墙，不是一方垒起来的。光共产党整风，墙拆不干净。
    他随即分析这座墙起来的原因。这原因，是因为新社会来的人和旧社会来的人的语言不同。语言不同，就容易发生问题。如有人把汽车司机喊作汽车夫，就可能引起误会。因此他说，与党外人士合作，首先要懂得他们的语言和习惯。遇到像上面一类的误解，党员应该诚恳地告诉对方，以后就会改正的。但是有的党员不这样做，对方说错了话，不帮助纠正，反而记在本子上，日积月累，遇到机会，就都搬出来整人。虽然其中可能有的话有思想问题，但大部分都是由于旧社会的习惯带来的。他说，语言习惯不同，在共产党内也有，如从延安来的和长期做地下工作的，有时就不完全一样。上述情况，遇到性情急躁的人，就会更糟。性急的人，党内和党外都有。因此要针对这种情况教育两方面的人。这一点很重要。语言习惯看来事情小，但是影响大。
    改变一些过时的制度才能实现互相监督
    曾昭抡在发言中着重谈了互相监督的问题。他认为，民主党派所以没有很好地发挥作用，一方面是本身还没有作好工作，另一方面，是在“长期共存、互相监督”的方针提出后，某些制度还没有改变，不能适应新的情况。他谈到，过去讨论国家体制问题，民主党派都参加了；各个方面的体制，在各个方面工作的民主党派成员也都参加讨论过。但对这样大的问题，民主同盟中央却从来没有讨论过一次。他觉得，领导党对国家重大问题先讨论，是没人反对的；不过，民主党派是不是也可以比较早一些参加讨论，早了解些情况？
    他还提出了另外两个意见。
    第一个意见，他认为，三反和肃反斗争，成绩都是基本的和主要的，但是也由于有一些缺点，发生了不少副作用。“三反”斗争中的副作用，到现在五年了还没有完全消除掉。政府是不是想办法加以消除，这会有利于统战工作的。
    第二个意见是：民主党派成员的意见，容易反映到上面来，而无党派民主人士的意见，因为没有组织系统，反映上来就不容易。曾昭抡说，这算不算统战工作中的一个漏洞？他建议今后要给无党派民主人士发表意见的机会。
    党员向非党求友求师非常有意义
    陈铭枢最后发言。他谈到，文教界的党员负责干部，有的用非所长，这种情况特别在高等学校中为严重。他希望能够深入调查一下，给他们重新调整工作。他认为现在整风期间，党员向非党求友、求师的作法，从全国范围来看，是非常有意义的事情。
    关于改善党与党外人士关系的四点建议
    中国国民党革命委员会副主席张治中十日的书面发言如下：
    维汉部长：关于党与党外人士的关系问题，我在政协会议上已经发了言，其中我的建议四点，即（一）从思想认识上解决问题；（二）从制度上求得保证；（三）从生活和交往上培养感情；（四）从加强学习，加强宣传教育和加强检查工作上贯彻政策；这四点建议，希望你加以考虑。其他没有什么意见。
