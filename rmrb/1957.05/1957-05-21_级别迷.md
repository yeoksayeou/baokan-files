Level Obsession
Zou Difan didn't get a promotion last year, and this year he's still agonizing over it. "Eleventh grade, what kind of status is that? I'm an old revolutionary from 1938." "What, small cars are only for tenth grade, and they hit the brakes so hard at my level! Why are my theater tickets in the twelfth row? Why am I seated at the third table at today's banquet? Sigh, the public housing doesn't care about people, and they don't even leave me a reception room!" Walking, sleeping, all with ulterior motives, eating, entertaining, all thinking about eleventh grade. When working, he throws a tantrum, throwing down his pen in anger: "You still criticize me? How many pounds of millet have you eaten? Those who used to work under me are now at the prefectural committee level. I'm just paid for my labor..." Poor him, sleepless nights, comparing himself with this one, comparing himself with that one. Poor him, getting thinner every day, afraid this one doesn't respect him, afraid that one looks down on him. Therefore, he is sick and lying in bed, but he doesn't dare to go to just any doctor, only a hospital for bureau-level cadres will do. When the rectification movement came, he sighed as if he were very experienced: "What level is this storm? Is it a gentle breeze and fine rain? That's good, as long as it's not eleventh grade." Come and save him! I don't know what grade this comrade's illness has reached!

    级别迷
    邹荻帆去年没有提级，今年他还在闹心病。“十一级，这算哪门子行情？我是三八年的老革命。”“什么，小汽车就坐到第十级，到我这级就杀车这么急！这晚上的戏票怎么把我分在十二排？今天的宴会为什么把我排在第三席？咳，公家宿舍不顾人，也不留给我一间会客室！”走路、睡觉、都有鬼心思，吃饭、娱乐、都想着十一级。工作的时候闹情绪，笔杆一扔发脾气：“你们还提我的意见，你吃过多少斤小米？从前在我下面工作的现在都是地委级。我呀，是按酬付出劳动力……”可怜他夜夜失眠，和这个比比，和那个比比。可怜他天天消瘦，怕这个不尊重，怕那个瞧不起。因此一病卧倒在床上，还不敢前去瞧医师，只有局长级的医院，他才肯去。整风运动来了他像很有经验地嘘一口气：“这次的风暴是哪一级？是和风细雨，那很好，只要不是十一级。”快来救救他吧我不知这位同志的病到了多少级！（附图片）
