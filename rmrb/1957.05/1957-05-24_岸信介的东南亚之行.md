    Kishi Nobusuke's Southeast Asia Trip
    Wu Xuewen
    Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi left for Southeast Asia on the 20th of this month to visit India, Burma, Pakistan, Ceylon, and Thailand, with a stopover in Taiwan. He is scheduled to return to Tokyo on June 4th and then go to the United States.
    This is the first time a Japanese Prime Minister has visited Southeast Asia after the war. What is the purpose of Kishi Nobusuke's trip to Southeast Asia before visiting the United States? This is a very interesting question.
    Since Kishi Nobusuke took office as Prime Minister, Japan's foreign policy has emphasized standing on the side of the "free countries" led by the United States, while also stating that Japan, as an Asian country, is willing to strengthen cooperation with the Asian-African group. In addition to its political reasons, this foreign policy also has its economic background. Japan, which relies on foreign trade to maintain its economic development, has lost its balanced relationship with Asia and the Americas in terms of markets and raw materials after the war due to the US occupation and the implementation of the US "embargo" policy. At present, Japan's steel, textile, chemical, and other industrial raw materials rely too heavily on the United States for supply. For example, scrap iron accounts for 80%, coking coal accounts for 80%, cotton accounts for 30%, and oil accounts for 15%. Because Japan has to transport raw materials from across the Pacific Ocean at a distance seven to nine times greater than its trade with Asian countries, the cost of Japanese goods is too high, making it difficult to compete with Western countries in the international market. At the same time, because Japan cannot implement an independent foreign policy and cannot change the supply of raw materials or expand trade with China for the time being, Japan's exports to the Asian region have fallen from 64% of its total exports before the war to 41%. However, Japan's economy has developed rapidly in the past two or three years. If the current imbalance between Asia and the Americas in terms of raw materials and markets is not changed, its economic development will encounter serious obstacles. The Japanese ruling class wants to adjust the raw materials and market problems to some extent without resisting US control and without losing the Asian market. Therefore, it put forward the slogan of "economic diplomacy," leaning on the United States on the one hand, and reaching out to Asian countries on the other to show closeness. Kishi Nobusuke's trip to Southeast Asia and his visit to the United States are precisely based on such an economic background, and also outline a preliminary sketch of Japan's foreign policy.
    Kishi Nobusuke once said at the third anniversary of the "Asia Society" that "Japan has no other choice but to cooperate with Southeast Asian countries." He recently said that he will exchange views with Asian leaders on Japan's economic cooperation plans with Asian countries during his visit to Southeast Asia; and said that during his visit to the United States, Japan's economic cooperation plans with Asian countries will be one of the important issues discussed. It can be seen from these remarks by Kishi Nobusuke that his visit to Southeast Asia is directly related to Japan's desire to "develop Southeast Asia."
    Although Japan's trade with the Southeast Asian region has made some progress in recent years, it is not very significant compared to the growth rate of its overall foreign trade. Without improving the current relationship with Southeast Asian countries, it will be difficult to further increase trade with Southeast Asia in the future. Therefore, Japan wants to take advantage of the opportunity of Southeast Asian countries demanding economic independence to invest in equipment in Southeast Asia by assisting some countries in economic construction, in order to strengthen the competition of commodity exports through this method of capital export. However, so far, Japan's capital exports to Southeast Asia have mainly been in the form of private enterprises, which has not been very smooth. In terms of scale, by the beginning of this year, Japan had only sixteen joint ventures and forty technical assistance projects with countries such as India, Burma, the Philippines, Ceylon, Malaya, South Vietnam, and Cambodia. There is no question of "developing Southeast Asia." At the same time, because Southeast Asian countries have great suspicions about Japan, the Japanese government is very cautious in its dealings with Southeast Asia and has not dared to come forward publicly. Therefore, Takeo Miki, Secretary-General of the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan, and Kenzo Matsumura, special envoy of former Prime Minister Ishibashi, visited Southeast Asia one after another not long ago, wanting to understand the views of Southeast Asian countries on Japan and explain Japan's situation in order to seek understanding through contact with government leaders of Southeast Asian countries. However, the impression gained by Miki and Matsumura after visiting Southeast Asia was that Southeast Asian countries believed that Japan was leaning too much towards the United States and had forgotten its Asian position. Therefore, they were very wary of Japanese-US cooperation in "developing Southeast Asia." Matsumura firmly advocated that Kishi Nobusuke personally go to Southeast Asia for diplomatic activities. Therefore, it can be understood that Kishi Nobusuke's trip to Southeast Asia is to change the views of Southeast Asian countries on Japan, gain the trust of Southeast Asian countries in Japan, and pave the way for the future "development of Southeast Asia."
    Japan's desire to "develop Southeast Asia" cannot be solved by relying solely on compensation. It needs a lot of funds. Japanese financial groups are not interested in investing in areas they consider to be "politically unstable." They have always wanted to realize the development plan of American capital - Japanese technology - Southeast Asian resources, which involves the US's Asian policy. Japan believes that "the US's past Asian policy was unsuccessful" and "does not conform to the feelings of Asians." Japan wants to convince the United States by saying that "to prevent the communization of the Asian-African group, economic cooperation is a more powerful means than military aid," thereby obtaining US "aid." Therefore, Kishi Nobusuke wants to take advantage of the increasingly high tide of the anti-colonial movement in Asian and African countries in recent years to exchange views on US policy with government leaders of various countries during his visit to Southeast Asia, so that he can discuss with the United States during his visit to the United States and enable the United States to provide money for Japan to "develop" Southeast Asia. At the same time, according to news from Washington from Japanese reporters, the United States also agrees that Kishi Nobusuke should visit Southeast Asia before visiting the United States, because if he can gain the trust of various countries, it will also be beneficial to the United States. Obviously, Kishi Nobusuke's visit to Southeast Asia is to prepare for his visit to the United States.
    From the perspective of Japan's domestic political situation, Japanese public opinion unanimously demands that Japan should strengthen its ties with Asian countries. The former Kaishinto (Progressive Party) Reformist faction and the Kono faction within the Liberal Democratic Party are also dissatisfied with the Kishi faction's overly pro-American stance. Kishi Nobusuke's trip to Southeast Asian countries not only serves as a political gesture to the voters, but also reconciles the contradictions between factions within the party, in order to postpone the personnel reforms of the cabinet and the Liberal Democratic Party, which is beneficial to consolidating the Kishi faction's power. Furthermore, since the Japan Socialist Party's goodwill delegation to China played a significant role in the issue of restoring Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations after returning to Japan, Kishi Nobusuke wants to use this visit to Taiwan to dilute the impact of the Socialist Party delegation's visit to China and use this to win the favor of the United States.
    However, Kishi Nobusuke's purpose in visiting Southeast Asia cannot be easily achieved. First of all, to dispel the doubts of Southeast Asian countries about Japan and gain their trust, it depends on whether Japan truly stands on the side of the Asian-African group and whether it has the determination to implement an independent foreign policy. It is said that some Japanese officials stationed in India and Burma are often asked why Japan has not yet established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China. These countries often measure the degree of Japan's political independence by Japan's attitude towards China. Although Prime Minister Kishi is going to visit countries such as India, Burma, Pakistan, and Thailand this time, he is also going to visit Taiwan, which offsets the significance of his visit to Southeast Asia. Moreover, although Japan is no longer an imperialist country today, it still stands on the same line as US imperialism, and it is difficult to expect that Southeast Asian countries will immediately change their views on Japan in just a few days of travel.
    Japan's request to use American capital to "develop Southeast Asia" has long been expressed to the United States, but the United States has not given a clear answer. This spring, Fairless, chairman of the US Foreign Aid Investigation Committee, after inspecting Southeast Asia and the Near and Middle East, stated at a press conference held in Washington that he wanted to create an "Asian Common Market." When a Japanese reporter asked him whether the "Asian Common Market" meant that American capital would aid Japan in "developing Southeast Asia," the American gentleman ignored him. US Assistant Secretary of State Robertson also talked about the issue of US capital "aiding" Japan at the House Foreign Affairs Committee of the last Congress. He said: It should not be manipulating the US economy. The basic idea of the United States is that to "develop" the economy of the Southeast Asian region is not solely for Japan, but for the "security guarantee" of the United States. These attitudes of US officials show that the United States is unwilling to provide money for Japan to "develop" Southeast Asia, so that Japan becomes a competitor of the United States, but rather wants to use aid to Japan to enter Southeast Asia and act as a vanguard for the United States in establishing an Asian military system. The United States has long stated, and has been using overseas military procurement to "aid" Japan. It is estimated that during Kishi Nobusuke's visit to the United States this time, he will still use stepping up armaments as a condition for granting Japan "aid." However, what Japanese financial groups are currently interested in is developing the economy and expanding trade, because the will of the Japanese people and the situation in Asia no longer allow Japan to use military means to expand. The contradiction between the Japanese and American ruling classes over US aid and armaments will still be difficult to resolve in the future.
    Of course, this does not mean that Kishi Nobusuke's trip to Southeast Asia will be fruitless. It can be affirmed that his visit will help enhance mutual understanding between Japan and Southeast Asian countries; If Japan truly stands on the side of the Asian-African group, exchanges views on Asian-African affairs with leaders of various countries, and draws strength from the high emotions of the people and politicians of various countries against colonialism, it can increase the weight of his visit to the United States and put him in a more advantageous position in negotiations with the United States. At the same time, if Japan can truly change its foreign policy of leaning to the United States, advanced Japanese industrial technology can help the economic construction of Southeast Asian countries and bring broad prospects to the Japanese economy.

    岸信介的东南亚之行
    吴学文
    日本首相岸信介已于本月20日去东南亚访问印度、缅甸、巴基斯坦、锡兰和泰国，并顺道到台湾一行，定6月4日回东京，然后再去美国。
    战后日本首相访问东南亚，这还是第一次。岸信介在访美之前，先到东南亚走一趟，究竟是目的何在？这是个很有意思的问题。
    自从岸信介出任首相以来，日本的外交政策是一方面强调站在以美国为首的“自由国家”立场，同时又表示日本作为一个亚洲国家愿加强和亚非集团的合作。这种外交方针除了它的政治原因外，还有它的经济背景。依靠对外贸易来维持经济发展的日本，战后由于美国的占领和执行美国的“禁运”政策，贸易结构在市场和原料等方面已经失去了同亚洲及美洲的平衡关系。目前，日本的钢铁、纺织、化工等工业原料过多地依靠美国供应，其中如废铁占80％、焦炭占80％、棉花占30％、石油占15％。由于日本要用相当于和亚洲国家往来七倍至九倍的距离自太平洋的彼岸运来原料，使得日本商品成本过高，很难在国际市场上和西方国家竞争。同时，由于日本不能执行自主的对外政策，一时还不能改变原料的供应情况和扩大同中国的贸易，已使日本对亚洲地区的出口从战前占其输出总额的64％降至41％。然而，近两三年来日本的经济发展得很快，如果在原料和市场上不改变目前和亚、美两洲的不平衡关系，它的经济发展必将遇到严重的阻碍。日本的统治阶级想要在不反抗美国控制，也不丢掉亚洲市场的情况下来在某种程度上调整一下原料和市场问题，所以便提出了“经济外交”的口号，一面靠在美国的身上，一面又伸手向亚洲国家表示亲近。岸信介把东南亚之行和访美连在一起，恰是从这样一个经济背景出发，也给日本外交政策描画了一张素图。
    岸信介在“亚洲协会”三周年纪念会上曾说：“日本除与东南亚各国合作外别无他策”。最近又说，他去东南亚将就日本同亚洲各国的经济合作计划和亚洲各国领袖交换意见；并说：访美时，日本同亚洲各国的经济合作计划将是讨论中的重要问题之一。从岸信介的这些谈话中可以看出，他访问东南亚是和日本要“开发东南亚”有直接关系的。
    几年来，日本对东南亚地区的贸易虽然有些进展，但和整个对外贸易额的增长速度比较，并不是十分显著的。不改善目前和东南亚国家的关系，今后就难以再增加对东南亚的贸易。于是，日本便想要乘东南亚国家要求经济独立的时机，通过协助一些国家进行经济建设向东南亚进行设备投资，以期用这种输出资本的方式加强商品输出的竞争。可是，到目前为止，日本对东南亚的资本输出主要是以民间企业方式出现，进行得并不顺利。从规模上来看，到今年初为止，日本和印度、缅甸、菲律宾、锡兰、马来亚、南越和柬埔寨等国家的合办公司只有十六所，技术援助事业只有四十件，根本谈不上什么“开发东南亚”。同时，由于东南亚国家对日本抱有很大疑惧，日本政府对东南亚的来往很慎重，一直不敢公然出面。因此，日本自由民主党干事长三木武夫和前首相石桥的特使松村谦三，不久前接连地访问了东南亚，想要通过和东南亚各国政府领导人的接触，了解东南亚各国对日本的看法和解释日本的处境以求得谅解。但，三木和松村在访问东南亚后得到的印象是东南亚国家认为日本是向美一边倒，忘记了亚洲的立场，所以对日美合作“开发东南亚”很有戒心，松村坚决主张岸信介亲自去东南亚进行外交活动。因此可以理解，岸信介的东南亚之行，是为了改变东南亚国家对日本的看法，争取东南亚国家对日本的信任，为将来“开发东南亚”开辟道路。
    日本想要“开发东南亚”只依靠通过赔偿的方式是不能解决问题的，它需要有大量的资金。日本财阀对于向他们认为是“政情不隐”的地区投资是不感兴趣的。他们一直在想实现美国资本——日本技术——东南亚资源的开发计划，这里面就牵涉到美国的亚洲政策问题。日本认为，“美国过去的亚洲政策是不成功的”，“不符合亚洲人的感情”，日本想用“要防止亚非集团共产化，经济合作较之军事援助是更有力的手段”来说服美国，从而得到美“援”。因此，岸信介想利用近年来亚非国家反对殖民主义的运动日益高涨的形势，在访问东南亚时和各国政府首脑交换对美国政策的看法，以便在访美时和美国商量，使美国能够出钱给日本进行东南亚的“开发”。同时，据日本记者发自华盛顿的消息表明，美国也赞同岸信介在访美前先访问东南亚，因为如能取得各国的信任对美国也有好处，显然，岸信介的访问东南亚是为访问美国作准备。
    从日本国内的政治形势来看，日本舆论一致要求日本应和亚洲国家加强往来，自由民主党内的前改进党革新派及河野派也对岸派的过于亲美主张有所不满。岸信介去东南亚国家走上一趟，不仅可以对选民作一政治姿态，也可以调和一下党内派系矛盾，以便推迟内阁和自由民主党内的人事改革工作，对巩固岸派势力有利。还有就是，由于日本社会党访华亲善使节团回国后在恢复中日邦交问题上起了重大作用，岸信介想利用这次访问台湾来冲淡社会党代表团的访华作用，并借此来取得美国的欢心。
    然而，岸信介访问东南亚的目的并非轻易可以达到的。首先，要想解除东南亚国家对日本的疑惧、换取对日本的信任，要看日本是否真正地站在亚非集团的立场，是否有执行独立外交政策的决心。据说，驻在印度和缅甸的一些日本官员常常被问到日本为什么还不和中华人民共和国建交的问题，这些国家常以日本对中国的态度来衡量日本政治独立的程度。岸首相这次虽去访问印、缅、巴、泰等国，但又去访问台湾，这就在抵消他访问东南亚的意义。何况，日本今天虽然已经不是帝国主义，但他仍和美帝国主义站在一条线上，很难期待在几天的旅行中就使东南亚国家立即改变对日本的看法。
    日本想要利用美国资本来“开发东南亚”的要求早已向美国表示过，美国一直没有明确答复。今年春，美国援外调查会会长费尔勒斯在考察了东南亚和中近东后，曾在华盛顿举行的记者招待会上表示要搞“亚洲共同市场”。当一位日本记者问他“亚洲共同市场”是否意味着美国资本援助日本“开发东南亚”时，这位美国先生竟置之不理。美国助理国务卿罗伯逊在上届国会众议院外交委员会上也谈到美国资本“援助”日本的问题，他说：它不应该是操纵美国经济的，美国的基本思想是，要“开发东南亚”地区的经济，不是单单为了日本，而是为了美国的“安全保障”。美国官员们的这些态度在说明，美国不愿意出钱给日本“开发”东南亚，以至使日本成为美国的竞争者，而是要通过援助日本打入东南亚，替美国在建立亚洲军事体制中充当一名马前卒。美国早就表示过，而且也一直在用海外军事采购来“援助”日本，估计这次岸信介访问美国时，仍会用加紧军备作为给予日本“援助”的条件。但，日本财阀目前感到兴趣的是发展经济，扩大贸易，因为日本人民的意志和亚洲的形势已经不允许日本再用军事手段来扩张了。日美统治阶级在美援和军备间所存在的矛盾，今后仍然不易解决。
    当然，这并不是说，岸信介的东南亚之行就一无所成。可以肯定，他这次访问将有助于增进日本和东南亚国家之间的互相了解；日本如果真正站在亚非集团的立场，和各国领袖交换对亚非事务的看法，并从各国人民和政治家反对殖民主义的高昂情绪中取得力量，是可以增加他访问美国时的重量、可以使他在同美国谈判时处于较有利的地位的。同时，如果日本真正能改变向美一边倒的外交政策，先进的日本工业技术是可以有助于东南亚国家的经济建设，并给日本经济带来宽广的前途的。
