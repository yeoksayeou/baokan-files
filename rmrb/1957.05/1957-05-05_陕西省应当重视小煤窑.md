Shaanxi Province Should Pay Attention to Small Coal Mines

    The people of Shaanxi Province have been using indigenous methods to mine coal for more than a thousand years, and small coal mines are found throughout the province. Over the years, these small coal mines have played a significant role in solving the coal problem in the Shaanxi area. They not only shoulder the task of supplying coal for farmers to burn, but also supply some coal for production to handicrafts and small local industries. In recent years, state-owned coal mines in Shaanxi have developed, but they still cannot keep up with small coal mines. For example, in 1956, state-owned coal mines in Shaanxi Province produced a total of more than 490,000 tons of coal, while small coal mines using indigenous methods produced more than 970,000 tons. In the future, with the development of national construction and the improvement of people's lives, the amount of coal needed in all aspects will gradually increase. Especially after agricultural cooperativization, farmers have used much of the firewood and grass that used to be used as fuel as feed or composted into fertilizer. In this way, the amount of coal used in rural areas has increased significantly. According to surveys, the amount of coal used in rural areas of Shaanxi Province in 1956 was more than double that of 1953. Therefore, in order to solve the problem of coal use in rural areas, it is even more necessary to pay attention to the role of small coal mines. At the same time, small coal mines can be built quickly. Generally, coal can be produced in the same year they are built, and the production cost is generally lower than that of state-owned coal mines. Local production and sales can also reduce a lot of transportation costs. Problems in equipment and technology for the construction of small coal mines are also easy to solve.
    However, in the past, some leading personnel of relevant departments in Shaanxi Province underestimated the role of small coal mines. They one-sidedly emphasized that the direction of China's coal mining industry development is to build medium and small-sized mechanized coal mines, and one-sidedly emphasized that small coal mines using indigenous methods are backward in production and will also damage national resources. Therefore, they did not pay attention to the management and development of small coal mines. Under the control of this idea, Shaanxi Province once closed down many small coal mines, and some problems in the production of small coal mines have not been well resolved. The agency responsible for leading local small coal mines only manages a few large joint state-private coal mines along the transportation lines; before the first half of 1956, no one had ever been sent to northern Shaanxi, where there were the most small coal mines and the most problems.
    Shaanxi Province has very rich coal reserves. The Weibei Coalfield, one of the main coalfields, stretches from Hancheng in the east to Longxian in the west, nearly 400 kilometers long and 3 kilometers wide, with an average coal seam thickness of about 5 meters, containing approximately 5 billion tons of coal. The Shanbei Coalfield stretches from Fugu and Yulin in the north to Yanchang in the south, with coal seams connected in one piece. It is estimated that the reserves are also over 5 billion tons. The state cannot universally exploit such rich coal deposits in a short period of time. At present, industrial production and people's lives require a large amount of coal, and it is impossible to wait until large mines are built before using coal. Therefore, it is very necessary to appropriately develop some small coal mines and strengthen the leadership of small coal mines. In order to meet the needs of the country and the broad masses of the people, the relevant departments in Shaanxi Province should attach importance to the production and development of small coal mines.

    陕西省应当重视小煤窑
    陕西省人民用土法开采煤炭已经有一千多年的历史，小型煤窑遍于全境。历年来，这些小煤窑对于解决陕西地区用煤问题起了相当重要的作用，它不仅担负着供应农民烧煤的任务，同时也供应给手工业和小型地方工业一些生产用煤。近几年，陕西境内的国营煤矿有了发展，但是仍然赶不上小型煤窑。例如1956年陕西地区国营煤矿共生产煤炭四十九万多吨，用土法开采的小煤矿却生产了九十七万多吨。今后，随着国家建设的发展，人民生活的改善，各方面需用煤炭数量将逐渐增加，尤其在农业合作化以后，农民把许多过去用作燃料的柴草作了饲料，或者沤成肥料，这样，农村用煤数量就显著增加了。据调查，1956年陕西省农村用煤量，比1953年增加了一倍以上。因此，要解决农村用煤问题，更需要注意发挥小型煤窑的作用。同时，小型煤窑的建设速度快，一般当年建设当年就可以出煤，生产成本一般也比国营煤矿低，就地产销，还可以减少很多运输费用。建设小煤窑的设备、技术等方面的问题也容易解决。
    但是，过去陕西省有关部门的某些领导人员对小型煤窑的作用估计不足。他们片面地强调我国煤矿工业发展的方向是建设中、小型的机械化煤矿，片面强调土法开采的小煤窑生产落后，还会破坏国家资源，因此对小型煤窑的管理和发展便不重视。在这种思想的支配下，陕西省曾经封闭过不少小煤窑，小煤窑生产中的一些问题也一直没有得到很好的解决。负责领导地方小煤窑的机关只管交通沿线几个较大的公私合营煤窑；在1956年上半年以前，根本没有派人到小型煤窑最多、问题也最多的陕北去过。
    陕西省境内煤的蕴藏量很丰富。主要煤田之一的渭北煤田，东起韩城，西止陇县，近四百公里长，三公里宽，煤层厚度平均有五公尺左右，约有五十亿吨煤。陕北煤田，北起府谷、榆林，南至延长，煤层连成一片，据估算，蕴藏量也在五十亿吨以上。这样丰富的煤藏，国家在短时间内是不可能普遍开采的。目前工业生产和人民生活需要大量煤炭，又不可能等待建成大矿井以后再来用煤，因此，适当发展一些小煤窑，加强对小煤窑的领导，就是十分必要的了。为了满足国家和广大人民的需要，陕西省有关部门应该对小型煤窑的生产和发展重视起来。　　李茜
