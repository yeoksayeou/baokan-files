Xinhua News Agency, London, May 29th: (By Our Correspondent Peng Di) The United Nations Disarmament Subcommittee meeting has entered an important stage this week. The possibility of reaching a partial disarmament agreement seems greater than before, because it is said that the US representative, Stassen, has brought a new proposal to "compromise with the Soviet Union."

The attitude of the United States will be very important for progress in the disarmament talks. As Labour MP Crossman said on the 28th, "It is the Americans, not the Russians, who have been holding up any progress on (the disarmament issue) lately. It is foolish not to recognize this fact."

The content of the new US proposal has not been announced. It is said that this is because the United States wants to discuss it with other Western countries in the Subcommittee before formally submitting the proposal.

The Subcommittee held its second meeting on the 28th, after a ten-day recess. At this meeting, following the representatives of the United States, the Soviet Union, and Canada, the British and French representatives also expressed their willingness to resume serious negotiations.

However, the British representative, Lord, also said that, at present, backstage activities should temporarily outweigh activities at the conference table. It is believed here that this statement indicates that the Western countries themselves have different reactions to the US proposal and need more time for off-site discussions.

Stassen and the French representative, Moch, flew to Paris on the evening of the 28th to attend the meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's Permanent Council, which will discuss the Western disarmament plan.

Although British officials have refused to comment on the content of the US proposal, newspapers have widely reported that the United States will propose: first, only the three countries that already possess nuclear weapons (the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom) should possess such weapons; second, modify the aerial inspection zone plan; and third, reduce conventional armaments in stages. British newspapers, in commenting on this proposal, believe that it is still far from what the people of all countries hope for, because the proposal itself does not require a ban on atomic weapons. The "Daily Herald" editorial on the 29th wrote that the people of all countries are demanding an agreement to stop testing nuclear weapons as the first step in disarmament.

Xinhua News Agency, May 29th: London - The United Nations Disarmament Commission Subcommittee continued its closed-door meeting on the 28th. According to Western news agencies, the British and French representatives who spoke at the meeting also requested a partial agreement on disarmament issues.

Outside the Disarmament Subcommittee meeting, British and French officials are making comments on the prospects for resolving the disarmament issue. British Foreign Secretary Lloyd said on the 27th: "There is reason to hope that reaching a partial disarmament agreement is possible," but he also said that Britain hopes that any partial agreement can fit the steps to be taken in the first stage as stipulated in the British and French disarmament plans.

A French Foreign Ministry spokesman said on the 28th that France is in close contact with the United States regarding the possibility of reaching a "first stage" disarmament agreement, but it will take some time to assess whether the Disarmament Subcommittee can truly reach a partial agreement.

It is reported that France is currently most dissatisfied with the US disarmament plan in that it only allows the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom, the three countries that already possess atomic nuclear weapons, to possess such weapons. French government leaders believe that the French parliament will never approve any agreement that effectively excludes France from the group of great powers.

### 西方国家代表表示愿意认真谈判  裁军会议有可能达成局部协议

    西方国家代表表示愿意认真谈判
    裁军会议有可能达成局部协议
    新华社伦敦29日电　本社记者彭迪报道：联合国裁军小组委员会的会议本星期已经进入了重要阶段。达成局部裁军协议的可能性看来是比以前大了，因为据传美国代表史塔生带来了“同苏联妥协”的新建议。
    美国的态度对于裁军会谈获得进展将是很重要的。正如工党议员克罗斯曼28日所说的，“最近一直在使（裁军问题）的任何进展陷于停顿的是美国人而不是俄国人。不承认这个事实是很愚蠢的。”
    美国的新建议的内容还没有宣布，据说，这是因为美国要在正式提出这个建议以前首先同小组委员会里面的其他西方国家讨论一下。
    小组委员会28日在休会十天之后开了第二次会。在这一天的会议上，英国和法国代表继美、苏、加代表之后，也表示了愿意恢复认真谈判的态度。
    但是，英国代表诺布耳又说，在目前，幕后活动暂时还应该多于会议桌上的活动。这里认为，这句话表明西方国家本身对美国建议的反应是不同的，需要更多时间进行会外讨论。
    史塔生和法国代表莫克已经在28日晚上飞赴巴黎，参加北大西洋公约组织常设理事会会议，会议将讨论西方的裁军计划。
    虽然英国官方人士对美国建议的内容矢口不谈，但是报纸却广泛报道说，美国将建议：第一，只准已经拥有核武器的三个国家（美、苏、英）拥有这种武器；第二，修改空中视察区计划；第三，分阶段削减常规军备。英国报纸在评论这个建议时认为，这个建议离开各国人民所希望的还很远，因为建议本身并没有要求禁止原子武器。“每日先驱报”29日的社论写道，各国人民要求就停止试验核武器达成协议，作为裁军的第一个步骤。
    据新华社29日讯　伦敦消息：联合国裁军委员会小组委员会28日继续举行秘密会议。据西方通讯社透露，在会上发言的英、法两国代表也要求就裁军问题达成局部协议。
    在裁军小组委员会会议外，英、法两国官方人士正纷纷对解决裁军问题的前景发表评论。英国外交大臣劳埃德27日说：“有理由希望，达成局部裁军协议是可能的”，但是他又表示，英国希望任何局部协议能够适合英法的裁军计划所规定的在第一阶段采取的步骤。
    法国外交部发言人28日说，法国正在就达成“第一阶段”的裁军协议的可能性同美国进行密切的联系，但是要估计裁军小组委员会是否能够真正达成局部协议，还要花一些时间。
    有消息说，法国目前对美国的裁军计划最不满的是这样一点：只许已经拥有原子核武器的美国、苏联和英国三个国家拥有这种武器。法国政府领袖们认为，法国议会绝不会批准实际上把法国从大国集团排挤出去的任何协定。
