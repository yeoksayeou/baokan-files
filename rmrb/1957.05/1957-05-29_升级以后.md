　　After Promotion

　　There are some comrades who, not long ago, were ordinary cadres, interacting with everyone daily in a close and natural way. Since being promoted to section chief, bureau chief, manager, or team leader, they have become taciturn and wear a serious face daily. If someone calls him "Old He" or "Comrade He," they ignore it; but if you call out "Deputy Section Chief He!" their ears perk up immediately, responding with a smile, and they will answer any questions.

　　Some people even specially buy a wool suit to match their new position; and there was even a comrade who, on the one hand, asked the organization for relief, and on the other hand, borrowed money from others to buy leather shoes and a watch!

　　It's a pity, why are some of our comrades so keen on titles and airs? For someone who is determined to dedicate themselves to the cause of communism, what are these "external things" worth?

　　From the small to the large, we are truly worried for them: will the style of diligently working hard for the revolution prevail? Or will the style of "fame, fortune, and enjoyment" prevail?

    升级以后
    有这样的同志，他们不久前还是一般干部，和大家日常相处，亲密而自然。自从最近被提升为科长、局长、经理、股长之后，就变得沉默寡言了，日常摆出严肃的脸孔。别人叫他“老何”或者“何同志”，置若罔闻；改叫一声“何副科长！”耳朵就豁然亮了，报之以笑容，有问也会有答了。
    也有人为了和新的职位相称，特地买套呢制服穿；还有一位同志，一面要求组织救济，一面向别人借钱买皮鞋和手表！
    真可惜，为什么我们有些同志偏偏热中于头衔和派头？对于一个立志献身于共产主义事业的人来说，这种“身外之物”又算得了什么呢？
    以小见大，我们真为他们耽心：究竟是勤勤恳恳地干革命的风占了上风呢？还是“名利、享乐”的风占了上风呢？  陈篷图　冯美鑫
