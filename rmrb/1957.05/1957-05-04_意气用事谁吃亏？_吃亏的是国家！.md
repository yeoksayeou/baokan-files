Who Suffers When Acting Impulsively?
The Nation Suffers!

On February 16th, at the construction site of the Wujian Mining Branch Company – the B party – five rock drills suddenly stopped working; the workers held dry faucets, unable to mix mortar; and four concrete mixers were also cut off from their water supply.

What happened? It turned out that the water pump belonged to the A party and was shared by both parties. Because the A party no longer needed the pump, they stopped it without notifying the B party. This time, the B party's construction site was without water for six days. The loss from the five rock drills being unable to work alone amounted to more than 4,400 yuan, and the impact on the progress of other projects was difficult to calculate.

Why did the A party do this? It turned out that the B party had treated the A party in the same way. When the construction site was at Xiangbishan, the B party had a transformer that supplied power to both parties. At that time, every Saturday and Sunday evening, because the B party was not working, they would pull the power switch, forcing the A party to stop working as well. This was resolved after many consultations at the beginning of this year. Since then, the A party held a grudge against the B party. Stopping the water pump this time was, as Li Detian, deputy chief of the A party's mechanical department, said, to let the B party "taste the flavor of being without water."

The B party cut off the A party's power supply, and the A party retaliated with a "return shot" against the B party. These losses are all ultimately charged to the nation's account. Ziniu

The construction project of Zhengzhou Grinding Wheel Factory (A party) was contracted by the Fourth Engineering Company of the Central South Engineering Management Bureau (B party). German experts suggested to the A party that the floors of several workshops be thinned, which could save 287,000 yuan. However, the B party delayed implementing this suggestion, using the excuse that "the required rubble has all entered the construction site, and if this suggestion is implemented, the A party should first be responsible for handling the backlog of rubble." In fact, we know that the B party has not even signed an agreement to purchase the rubble. There is no question of "handling the backlog of rubble."

This year, the various machines and equipment delivered from abroad are increasing day by day, and the warehouse cannot accommodate them. The A party requested the B party to build two temporary warehouses first. Initially, the B party refused to build them, using the excuse of a lack of bamboo. But after the A party found the bamboo, the B party put forward two unreasonable preconditions: 1. The project cost should be paid in full before construction starts; 2. The waste wood and waste formwork used in the temporary warehouse constructed last year should be paid for at the price of good wood. The A party would not agree to these conditions, so construction did not start. In fact, while they were arguing, the B party was also wasting time. In March, it began to rain in the Zhengzhou area, and more than a hundred machines, each worth thousands or tens of thousands of yuan, were still left in the open air. People who see this infuriating phenomenon cannot help but ask: Where has the B party's overall perspective gone? Ding Chao

### 意气用事谁吃亏？  吃亏的是国家！

    意气用事谁吃亏？
    吃亏的是国家！
    2月16日，武建矿山分公司——乙方工地上，五台凿岩机突然停止钻进；工人们拿着干干的水龙头，不能拌和灰浆；四台混凝土搅拌机也断绝了水源。
    这是怎么回事呢？原来水泵是甲方的，由甲乙双方共同使用，因为甲方不用这个水泵了，便没有通知乙方就停开了。这一次，乙方工地水断了六天，仅五台凿岩机不能工作的损失，就达四千四百多元，对其他工程进度的影响，损失就难以计算了。
    甲方为什么这样做呢？原来，乙方也这样对待过甲方。工地在象鼻山时，乙方有一个变压器，供给双方电源。那时每到星期六和星期日晚上，乙方因为不工作，就把送电开关拉掉了，弄得甲方也被迫停工。后来经过多次协商，到今年年初才解决。从此甲方对乙方就怀了成见。这次把水泵停了，其用意就像甲方机动科副科长李德田说的，要乙方“尝尝没有水的味道”。
    乙方切断甲方的电源，甲方又给乙方来一个“回马枪”。这些损失，最后统统挂在了国家的账上。　子牛
    郑州砂轮厂（甲方）的建筑工程是由中南工程管理总局第四工程公司（乙方）承包的。德国专家向甲方提议把几个车间的地坪改薄，可以节约二十八万七千元。可是乙方借口“所需片石已全部进入工地，如实施此项建议，甲方应首先负责处理片石积压的问题”，拖延着不执行这个建议。实际上我们晓得，乙方连购买片石的协议还没和人家签订。根本谈不到“处理片石积压的问题”。
    今年国外交付的各种机器设备一天天多起来了，仓库放不下，甲方要求乙方先建两栋临时仓库。起初乙方以缺乏竹子为借口，推辞不建。可是等到甲方找来了竹子之后，乙方又提出两个不合理的先决条件：一、此项工程价款，在开工前一次交付；二、去年施工的临时仓库所用的废木材、废模板，应按好木材价格付款。甲方不答应这些条件就不开工。其实，扯皮的时候，乙方也正是窝工的时候。三月，郑州地区已开始落雨，每台价值以千、万元计的百多台机器，还放在露天之下。人们看到这种令人气愤的现象，不禁要问：乙方的整体观点到哪里去了？　丁超
