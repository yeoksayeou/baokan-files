    Street Talk

    The Person Who Made “Conditions” to the Party
    In our Qingdao city, there is a jointly owned public-private factory. This factory has a deputy director named Zhang who recently presented three conditions to the Party: First, his grade should be raised from the eighteenth to the sixteenth; second, if it is only raised to the seventeenth grade, he must be paid retroactively from 1954; third, a job must be found for his wife. He threatened the organization and said to others: he would not eat until the “conditions” were answered. When we heard about this, we really couldn't believe it. Making conditions to the Party, how can this be tolerated! The Party should quickly save this kind of person!
        (Hao Delu, worker in Qingdao City)

    Mud Bodhisattva
    Says nothing;
    Learns nothing;
    Understands nothing;
    Expresses nothing;
    Anyway—
    I’m indispensable for a share of the offerings!
            (Bai Ge Fei, Beijing)

    Strange Tradition
    Comrades at the Changchun Film Studio are particularly particular about weddings, insisting that those attending the wedding must have a big feast; otherwise, people will not be satisfied. It is said that this is the tradition of Changying. Some time ago, a director from Changying, Yu Yanfu, held a wedding banquet at the largest restaurant in Changchun, with excessive eating and drinking. It is estimated that this cost at least six or seven hundred yuan. Not long ago, I saw five more couples getting married there, following the old tradition as usual. On that evening, almost everyone who attended the wedding was drunk, staggering, vomiting all over the place, and the stench was unbearable. Any outsider would feel a headache and heartache in such a situation.
              (Li Xingwen)

    "Bargain Books" and Others
    Everyone feels the paper shortage, but many places are wasting paper; everyone hopes to save, but many places are still wasting.
    Leaving aside other things. Recently, in Tianjin, I visited several "bargain" bookstores. After returning to Beijing, I also often go to "bargain" bookstores. I found that our "bargain" bookstores are increasing; and the shelves of bargain bookstores are also displaying more and more books. Some books have one or two hundred copies of each, and some are bundled and not yet on the shelves, probably coming directly from the warehouse to the "bargain section."
    There is another phenomenon. I recently saw some collections of poems and novels by writers. Today, this bookstore publishes one, and tomorrow that bookstore compiles and publishes one again. The number of articles added or subtracted is not significantly different. More strangely, these books have not sold out in bookstores, meaning that readers do not necessarily need republication. It is puzzling why so many publishing houses are rushing to re-edit them? Why not save some energy and resources to publish some new works?
    (Ye Hui)

    向党提“条件”的人
    我们青岛市有个公私合营的工厂，这厂有个姓张的副厂长，最近向党提出了三个条件：一、本人由十八级提到十六级；二、如果只提到十七级，就得从1954年起补发工资；三、一定要替他爱人找个职业。他威胁组织，并对别人说：在“条件”未答复前，决不吃饭。我们听了这件事，真是有点不相信。向党提起条件来了，这还像什么话！对这号人，党赶快救救他吧！
        （青岛市工人郝德路）
    泥菩萨
    不说什么；
    不学什么；
    不明白什么；
    不表示什么；
    横竖——
    缺不了我一份供果！
            （北京白鸽飞）
    奇怪的传统
    长春电影制片厂的同志结婚都特别讲究，一定要让参加婚礼的人大吃大喝一顿才行，不这样人们是不会满意的。据说这是长影的传统。前些日子，长影的一位导演于彦夫举行婚礼，在长春一家最大的饭店大摆筵席，狂吃痛饮，这次估计起码要花六、七百元。不久前我又在那里看到了五对结婚的，照例也按老传统来办事。在那天晚上几乎参加婚礼的大部分人都喝得酩酊大醉，东倒西歪，吐得满地都是，臭气难闻。任何一个外人到了这种场合都会感到头痛和痛心。
              （李兴文）
    “特价书”及其他
    大家都感到纸张“荒”，但是，许多地方又在浪费纸张；大家都希望节约，但是，许多地方还是在浪费。
    别的且不说。最近，我在天津，走了几家“特价”书店。回到北京后，也常常到“特价”书店去走走。我发现，我们的“特价”书店是越来越多了；而且特价书店的书架上摆的书也越多了，有的书，每种就放了一两百本，还有成捆的没有上架，大约是直接从堆栈里就到“特价部”来了。
    还有一种现象。我最近看到有些作家的诗和小说选集，今天这个书店出一本，明天那个书店又选编一次出版。其中增减的篇数出入并不大。更奇怪的是，这些书在书店并没有脱销，就是说读者并不一定还需要再出版。这就不解为什么许多出版社要抢着重编呢？何不省些精力、物力，再去出版一些新的作品呢？    （也卉）
