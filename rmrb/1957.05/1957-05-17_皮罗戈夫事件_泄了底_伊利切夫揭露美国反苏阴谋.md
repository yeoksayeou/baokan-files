Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 16th - At a press conference held on May 15th, the Director of the Information Department of the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ilyichev, issued a statement regarding the so-called "Pirogov Affair."

Ilyichev said that due to the artificially created "Pirogov Affair," the American authorities, on April 17th, demanded that Mashkanchev, a staff member of the Consular Section of the Soviet Embassy, immediately leave the United States, baselessly claiming that he was engaged in activities incompatible with his official status. Ilyichev used many facts to prove that this statement by the American authorities was untenable.

Speaking of the incident itself, Ilyichev said that Pirogov was originally a Soviet Air Force officer who, in 1948, along with another pilot, Borzov, betrayed the motherland and fled by plane to the American-occupied zone of Austria, and was later sent to the United States. Borzov, unable to endure the "American way of life," returned to the motherland in 1949. Pirogov continued to stay in the United States.

Recently, American newspapers have launched anti-Soviet propaganda surrounding the so-called "Pirogov Affair," saying that Mashkanchev put pressure on Pirogov and falsely claiming that Borzov had been executed after returning to the Soviet Union, and so on.

The truth of the matter is this: In March of this year, the Soviet Embassy in the United States received a letter from Borzov to Pirogov. Pirogov, fearing persecution after visiting the Soviet Embassy, ​​requested the embassy to deliver the letter to his home. In this situation, Mashkanchev visited his residence, handed over the letter to him, and answered questions about returning to the motherland. After this, at Pirogov's request, Mashkanchev met with him once more.

Ilyichev said that Mashkanchev's activities did not go beyond the scope of consular affairs. The American authorities' demand that Mashkanchev leave the country immediately can only be regarded as an unfriendly act, aimed at undermining the prestige of Soviet diplomats.

    “皮罗戈夫事件”泄了底
    伊利切夫揭露美国反苏阴谋
    据新华社莫斯科16日电　苏联外交部新闻司司长伊利切夫在5月15日举行的记者招待会上就所谓“皮罗戈夫事件”发表了声明。
    伊利切夫说，由于人为造成的“皮罗戈夫事件”，美国当局在4月17日要求苏联大使馆领事处工作人员马什勘切夫立刻离开美国，硬说他从事了同他的官职身份不相称的活动。伊利切夫用很多事实证明，美国当局的这种说法是站不住脚的。
    谈到事件本身时，伊利切夫说，皮罗戈夫原是苏联空军人员，他在1948年同另一个驾驶员鲍尔佐夫叛变了祖国，乘飞机逃往奥地利的美军占领区，后来被送到了美国。鲍尔佐夫因为不能忍受“美国生活方式”，在1949年返回了祖国。皮罗戈夫继续留在美国。
    最近，美国报纸围绕所谓“皮罗戈夫事件”发动了反苏宣传，说马什勘切夫对皮罗戈夫施加了压力，并且造谣说鲍尔佐夫返回苏联后已经被枪决等等。
    事情的真相是这样的：今年3月，苏联驻美国大使馆收到一封鲍尔佐夫给皮罗戈夫的信。皮罗戈夫害怕访问苏联大使馆后会受到迫害，因此请求使馆把信件送到他家里。马什勘切夫在这种情况下，访问了他的住所，转交了给他的信件，并且回答了关于重返祖国的问题。在这以后，根据皮罗戈夫的请求马什勘切夫同他又进行过一次会见。
    伊利切夫说，马什勘切夫的活动没有超出领事事务的工作范围。美国当局要求马什勘切夫立刻出境只能看作是不友好的行动，其目的在于损害苏联外交人员的威信。
