This area of Zhongguanyuan at Peking University is really big, with rows of houses stretching one after another. Although this wasn't my first time here, it still took me quite a while to find number 246. I knocked on the door a few times, and Professor Fu Ying himself answered.

Several newspapers were laid out on the sofa, one of which was the Beijing Daily, which featured an article by Professor Fu Ying. Our conversation began with this article. "These words are just clichés," he said.

"I have some opinions about the People's Daily's coverage," he said. "The other day at Qinghua, some people were dissatisfied with Qian Junrui and wanted him to make a public self-criticism. The People's Daily didn't publish this opinion." He said there were many opinions about Qian Junrui in higher education circles.

He felt that the current rectification method also had problems, being similar to previous movements, only in reverse this time, with leaders sitting in the middle allowing everyone to criticize them. Not all criticisms of leaders can be correct; some may be one-sided, some may be misunderstandings, and the actual situation may be completely different, but the criticized only have the obligation to listen to criticism, without the right to explain or defend themselves.

He believed that Peking University was doing a relatively good job in this rectification. The school leadership was quite thorough in letting things go, and their attitude was also sincere. Some other schools didn't expose much, which precisely shows that the problems there were serious. For example, leaders at the Petroleum Institute had said: There are no contradictions at the Petroleum Institute. Professor Fu Ying seemed to have particularly strong opinions about the Petroleum Institute, where he had taught before, and clearly had some unpleasant memories.

A Storm Caused by an Article

Professor Fu Ying published an article in the ninth issue of "Chemistry Bulletin" in 1955, titled "Scientific Research Work in Universities and Colleges – A Triptych." This article once caused a small storm. Recalling the situation at the time, he said:

"In that article, I talked about some of the problems we encountered in chemical research. I admit that my tone was not very good, but I could not agree with some people's views. The purpose of that article was to talk about bad phenomena, so I didn't say things like 'achievements are primary...' I didn't mention the Party in it, because I felt that the Party's leadership in science was not a problem. I cited some examples from the Petroleum Institute, believing that laymen should not criticize and interfere, and said a sentence: 'Criticisms made by those who have never held a test tube, let alone delved into world literature, even if not made with ulterior motives, are nothing more than labeling.' This was terrible: some people thought I was insinuating the Party, saying that the Party could not lead science. Some people at Peking University and Peking University Medical College said I was like Hu Feng. Some friends came to me and said that the article had caused misunderstandings and that I should write another one to explain that the Party could lead science. I said, what's the problem with that! Who would lead science if the Party didn't? Later, I wrote it and discussed it at the editorial board of the 'Chemistry Bulletin'. One editorial board member said: I don't think Professor Fu's first article opposed the Party's leadership, and if we publish this article now, it will make people feel that Professor Fu is under pressure. So it was not published later. My first article had quite a few readers. The municipal party committee asked the 'Chemistry Bulletin' to print many more copies. Premier Zhou read it, and it is said that Chairman Mao also read it. Because of this article, I became a celebrity." He smiled.

He took a sip of water and pondered, "When an article has problems, sometimes it's the speaker's fault. Premier Zhou and Comrade Peng Zhen also criticize people, but their criticisms not only hit the nail on the head, but their attitude is also sincere, making you feel convinced and have no resentment. It's not good if we only write articles for our own pleasure. Why say 'never held a test tube...'! Wouldn't it be better to say it nicely? If I were to write this article now, I wouldn't write it that way. If the same meaning is expressed in a different way, it will not cause resentment. My friend said that my way of writing was 'harming the meaning with words,' which is very true."

I interjected and said: I'm afraid readers shouldn't "harm the meaning with words" either, and I think that people who are truly cultured will pay serious attention to the reasonable things in the content of the article, and will not quibble over individual words and sentences.

He continued: "I was indeed not calm when I wrote it. Fan Changjiang said in a report once that I lacked sympathy for cadres. That's right, I was indeed very angry when I wrote that article. As far as I know, some of the shortcomings pointed out in that article still exist."

I asked him how things ended up later.

"I don't know the details. I heard that some people advocated pursuing it deeply. But then someone said that the issue of senior intellectuals had to be raised, and also said that I didn't have any political background. So it was not 'pursued' any further."

"The Party hasn't yet figured out the temperament of intellectuals" The topic shifted to the relationship between the Party and intellectuals, and Professor Fu Ying said:

"The Party still hasn't figured out the temperament of intellectuals. The requirement of intellectuals is to treat us as their own people, that's all, not caring about comfort in life. A person doesn't live for comfort. A professor has a preferential certificate and doesn't have to queue when going to the barber, but he would rather not enjoy this preferential treatment because he feels embarrassed. When watching a movie, good seats are specially reserved for us, and sitting in these special seats makes you think: they still treat me as a guest. I have a lot of opinions about the current salary increase for senior intellectuals. Of course, some people who have financial difficulties should be taken care of, but it's not good to add too much. If you say that our salaries are low, then what about the staff? The treatment of teachers and staff in schools is already disparate, and the gap will increase even more after the teachers get a raise. In fact, intellectuals don't want these things, they only hope that we are not treated as outsiders, and that we get more help in terms of manpower and material resources, so that we can do research well and contribute our strength. It's been many years since liberation, and everyone's problems should have been figured out. We should be believed to be patriotic and treated as our own people. If we are only given preferential treatment in material life, it will only alienate us from the masses and be seen as a special class by the masses. It is appropriate to use the method of educating people by comparing their current lives with the past to workers, but it is completely wrong to say that to professors. When I first returned from the United States in 1929, I lived in a very large house, and I lived in eight rooms alone, with a garden. It was indeed comfortable at that time, but thinking about it carefully, it was too unreasonable, why should I enjoy such happiness? The reason why the lives of senior intellectuals are not as good as before is not because they are low now, but because they were too high in the past. If you say that whoever makes my life better, I will support them, then what if Chiang Kai-shek gives more money? The lives of many professors are indeed not as good as before the War of Resistance, but we don't think the government is bad because of this. I support the Communist Party and the People's Government because they have made the country good. In the late Qing Dynasty and early Republic of China, my father worked in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and when I was seven or eight years old, he told me that none of the treaties China signed with foreign countries did not make us suffer. When I went to Shanghai in the third year of Xuantong, the entrance to the park was written: 'Dogs and Chinese are not allowed in.' Later, when I went to the United States, when I crossed the border to Canada to see the waterfalls, Japanese people could come and go freely, but Chinese people couldn't. Once, when I was doing a chemistry experiment and went to the warehouse to get medicine, the manager said: 'What are you Chinese doing studying science?' I studied in a church school, why did I become an atheist instead? Because I hated foreigners. In 1949, when I was in the United States for the second time, the political situation in China changed, and I thought: should I go back or not? I have seen revolutions more than once in my life. I thought: if it's a real revolution, I'll go back; if it's a fake revolution, I won't go back. When the army went south and fired a shot at a British warship while crossing the river, I was shocked when I saw this news, fearing that there would be an apology again and the revolution would end there. When I opened the newspaper the next day, Zhou Enlai issued a statement, not only did he not apologize, but he protested and cursed the British. Only then did I believe that it was a real revolution and decided to return to China. If it weren't for that shot, I wouldn't necessarily have come back! Think about it, why wouldn't I support the government? It vented decades of anger for me!"

Advocating "Democratic School Management"

Regarding the leadership style of schools, Professor Fu Ying felt that the current Party committee system was not good, but the previous school affairs committee method was also not good. He advocated democratic school management. "We can't leave out the Party committee, because without the Party committee, many things won't work; we can't leave out the professors either, because professors are ultimately the experts in business; in addition, it's best to have student representatives, because students are the most numerous." Talking about the relationship between the Party and the masses at Peking University, he felt it was better than other schools. "At Peking University, I only felt that the Party didn't express a willingness to make friends with me; at the Petroleum Institute, I felt that the Party was stepping on my head." There is factionalism at Peking University, but he felt that the most serious thing was bureaucracy. He said with a smile that bureaucracy at Peking University was "historically long." As for dogmatism, it varies from school to school and from department to department. He said that there was relatively little dogmatism in the Chemistry Department of Peking University. The experts in their department paid attention to combining it with China's actual situation, and often discussed problems with Chinese teachers and reached a consensus. As for some schools, it was terrible. His wife taught at the Petroleum Institute, and she was criticized for not studying Soviet experience when she did not immediately give students scores during the exam (because she still wanted to see his experimental results).

Mentioning the dogmatism when learning from the Soviet Union, Professor Fu Ying said that Comrade Qian Junrui was responsible for it, saying "dogmatism is also good." Higher Education Press translated many Soviet textbooks that did not fit the Chinese situation and were of very low quality, and were regarded as classics. It would be a mistake to measure the Soviet Union's chemical level based on certain textbooks. Two years ago, Soviet experts in the Chemistry Department of Peking University criticized: why do you translate so many textbooks, why don't you write your own, in fact you are completely capable of writing your own; you should translate some collections, which are things that are truly of scientific value."

Why is the quality of students low?

"I also want to talk about a problem that often troubles me," Professor Fu Ying said, "that is, the quality of students." He believed that, taking chemistry and physics as examples, the current students' level is much worse than before. In terms of the seriousness of learning attitudes, the current students are better than at any time in the past. But they just lack the ability to think independently. In the past, students could discuss with teachers, but now they can't. Students regard the teacher's words as the golden rule, and it's best to have only one voice. Students are not only bad at foreign languages, but also unfamiliar with Chinese; it is already rare to write a report that can convey the meaning (of course, liberal arts students may be better). "I have also seen some graduate student exam papers, and the better scores are almost all from those who graduated before liberation. The level of selected international students is also very low. Of course, there were also very bad international students in the past, but that was said to be through connections; those who really passed the exam based on their skills were very strong. I have supervised three American graduate students in the United States, and their grades were very good, and one of them has now become a small authority. After returning to China, I have supervised fourteen Chinese graduate students, and I would never admit that I supervised them less diligently than I supervised American students, even if you killed me. But their grades are much worse. In terms of supervisors, it's all me. In terms of the level at graduation from university, they are all about the same. But why are the grades so different after three or four years? I think there are at least two reasons: one is that our students suffer a lot in terms of foreign languages. Now in science and technology in physics and chemistry, English has the most scientific literature, followed by Russian and German. Our students are very bad at foreign languages, which limits them. Another reason is that our students don't work well with their hands - they despise experiments. Few foreign children can't repair cars, radios, or do carpentry work; we are ultimately an agricultural country and lack training in this area. Looking down on doing experiments is a problem of outlook on life. In this regard, the Physics Department of Peking University is worse than the Chemistry Department."

"The current students also lack broad knowledge. Students studying science and engineering cannot talk about literature, and few have even read Dream of the Red Chamber, and few can comment on a play artistically after watching it. I'm really surprised, saying that the homework is too heavy, but they learn less than we did back then. But we rarely heard of people suffering from neurasthenia back then, and neurasthenia is very common in schools now. Every time our friends talk about how to reduce the tension of students, it always ends in nothing and breaks up unhappily."

"I say this is indeed a problem, our current learning efficiency and work efficiency are very poor." Professor Fu Ying gave an example to prove this point. He said that the University of Michigan in the United States has more than 24,000 people, and the Chemistry Department is a large department, but there is only one cadre in the department, who is considered a secretary. She manages the daily administration of the entire department by herself, and she has plenty of time, not busy at all, and she knows the situation of the department very well. Now there are at least seven or eight cadres in the Chemistry Department of Peking University, and everyone is so busy that they are dizzy, but they don't know anything when asked.

    傅鹰教授一席谈
    王澈
    北大中关园这一片地方真够大，房子是一排接着一排。虽然我不是第一次来，但还是找了半天才找到246号。我敲了几下门，出来的正是傅鹰教授。
    沙发上摆着几份报纸，其中有一份是北京日报，那上面登载着傅鹰教授的文章。我们的谈话就从这篇文章起头。“这些话都是老生常谈了。”他说。
      “我对人民日报的报道有些意见。”他说。“前些天清华讨论，有人对钱俊瑞不满，要他公开检讨。这一点意见人民日报没有发表出来。”他说高等教育界对钱俊瑞的意见是很多的。
    他觉得现在的整风方式也有问题，又和从前搞运动差不多，只是这回反过来了，领导人坐在当中让大家来批评。对领导的批评，不可能都是对的，有的可能是片面的，有的可能是误会，实际情况完全不是那么回事，但被批评者只有听取批评的义务，没有解释辩护的权利。
    他认为，这一次整风，北大是搞得比较好的。学校领导方面放得比较彻底，态度也诚恳。有些别的学校揭发得不多，这正说明那里的问题严重。例如石油学院就有领导人说过：石油学院没有什么矛盾。傅鹰教授提起石油学院，意见好像特别多，他在那里任教过，显然有些不愉快的回忆。
    一篇文章引起的风波
    傅鹰教授在1955年第九期的“化学通报”上发表过一篇文章，题目是“高等学校的科学研究工作——一个三部曲”这篇文章曾经闹出一场小小的风波。他回想当时的情形说：
      “在那篇文章上我谈到了我们在化学研究方面所遭遇到的一些问题。我承认我的语气有些不好，但是有些人的看法我不能同意。那篇文章的目的是说不好的现象，因此我就没有说‘成绩是主要的……’这一类话头。里面也没有提到党，因为我觉得党领导科学这一点本不成问题。我举了一些石油学院的例子，认为外行不应该来指手划脚地批评，说了一句‘没有拿过试管，更没有涉猎过世界文学文献的人所提之批评，即使不是别有用心，也不过是扣帽子而已’。这一来可糟了：有人以为我是影射党，是在说党不能领导科学。北大、北大医学院有些人就说我是跟胡风一样的。有的朋友来跟我说，这篇文章引起误会了，应当再写一篇，说明党能够领导科学。我说，这还有什么问题！党不领导科学谁来领导呢？后来就写了，在‘化学通报’编委会上讨论。一个编委说：我看傅先生第一篇文章并没有反对党的领导的意思，如果现在又发表这篇文章，会使人感到傅先生是受到压力了。因此后来就没有登。我写的那第一篇文章是很有些读者的。市委叫‘化学通报’多印了许多份。周总理看过，据说毛主席也看过。由于这篇文章，我倒成了名人了。”他微笑起来。
    他喝了一口水，沉吟地说：“文章出了问题，有时也怪说话的人不好。周总理和彭真同志也批评人，但是他们的批评不但能打中要害，而且态度诚恳，使你听了心服口服，毫无反感。我们写文章，只图自己痛快，就不好了。为什么要说‘没拿试管……’呢！好好说不行吗？如果我现在来写这篇文章，就不会那么写了。同样的意思，如果换一种说法，就不会引起反感。我的朋友说我那种写法是‘以词害意’，这很对。”
    我插了一句说：恐怕读的人也是不应当“以词害意”的，而且我想真正有修养的人是会认真注意文章内容中的合理的东西，而不会斤斤计较于个别词句的。
    他接着说：“我写的时候的确也不够心平气和。范长江在有一次作报告时说，我对干部缺乏同情心。这一点倒是对的，我在写那篇文章时的确很有气。据我所知，那篇文章所指出的一些缺点，现在还存在。”
    我问他，以后的事情是怎样结束的。
      “详情不知。听说有人主张深追下去。但又有人说，现在高级知识分子的问题要提出了，另外又说我并没有什么政治背景。因此后来就没有再‘追’。”
    “党还没有摸透知识分子的脾气”话题转到了党和知识分子的关系，傅鹰教授说：
      “党到现在还没有摸透知识分子的脾气。知识分子的要求就是把我们当自己人，如此而已，并不在乎生活上的舒服。一个人活着并不是图舒服。一个教授拿着优待证，去理发可以不用排队，可是他宁肯不享受这种优待，因为不好意思。看电影时，特别为我们留着好位子，坐在这种特殊位子里，心里就想：还是把我当客人。我对现在给高级知识分子加薪很有意见。当然有些生活困难的应当照顾，但加得太多就不好。若说我们薪金低，那么职员怎么办？在学校里教员和职员的待遇已经是悬殊，教员加薪后就更增加了隔阂。其实知识分子并不希望这些，只希望不把我们当外人，在人力物力上多帮助，使我们能很好地作研究，能贡献出自己的力量。解放好些年，什么人有什么问题也该搞清楚了。应该相信我们是爱国的，拿我们当自己人。如果只在物质生活上给予优待，反而会使我们脱离群众，被群众看成特殊阶级。用现在生活比过去好的方法来进行教育，对工人说倒合适，对教授说就根本不对头。1929年我刚从美国回来时，住的是一所很大的房子，我一个人就住了八间，还有花园。那时确实舒服，但仔细想想，太不合理，凭什么这样享福？高级知识分子生活不如从前，不是因为现在低，而是因为过去太高。若说谁使我生活好，就拥护谁，那么蒋介石给更多的钱，怎么办？许多教授的生活的确不如抗战前，但我们并不因此就认为政府不好。我拥护共产党和人民政府，是因为它们把国家搞得好。清末民初我父亲在外务部做事，我七八岁的时候，他就告诉我，中国跟外国订的条约，没有一条不让我们吃亏。宣统三年我到上海，公园门口就写着：‘狗和华人不得入内’。后来到美国，过国境到加拿大看瀑布，日本人可以自由来往，中国人就不行。有一次我做化学实验，到库房领药品，管理人说：‘你们中国人学科学干什么？’我在教会学校念书，为什么反而成了无神论者呢？就因为讨厌外国人。1949年，那时我第二次在美国，中国国内政局起了变化，我就想：回去不回去？我这一辈子见过革命不止一次。我想：是真革命，就回去；假革命，就不回去。等到大军南下，过江时打了英国炮舰一炮，我看到了这消息大吃一惊，怕这回又要来个道歉，革命也要到此为止了。等到第二天打开报纸，周恩来发表声明，不但没有道歉，反而提出抗议，骂了英国一通。我这才相信是真革命，决定回国。要是没有这一炮，我还不一定回来呢！你想想看，我为什么不拥护政府呢？我积了几十年的气，它都替我出了！”
      主张“民主治校”
    关于学校的领导方式，傅鹰教授觉得现在这种党委制不好，但过去的校务委员会那种办法也不好。他的主张是民主治校。“不能撇开党委，因为离开了党委，很多事都行不通；也不能撇开教授，因为在业务上究竟是教授内行；此外，最好还要有学生的代表，因为学生人最多。”谈到北大的党群关系，他觉得比别的学校好。“在北大，我只觉得党没有表示愿意和我交朋友；在石油学院时，我可是觉得党踩在我头上。”北大的宗派主义是有的，但他觉得最严重的是官僚主义。他笑着说，官僚主义在北大是“历史悠久”的。至于教条主义，各校不同，各系也不同。他说北大化学系的教条主义比较少一些。他们系里的专家很注意结合中国实际情况，有问题常和中国教师商量，取得一致意见。至于有些学校就不得了，他的爱人在石油学院教书，考试时没有立即给学生记分（因为还想看他的实验成绩），就被批评为不学习苏联经验。
    提到了学习苏联时的教条主义，傅鹰教授说，钱俊瑞同志是有责任的，他说过“教条也好”。高等教育出版社翻译了很多苏联教本，并不切合中国情况，而且其中还有质量很低的，也奉为经典。若要以某些教本为根据来衡量苏联的化学水平，那准会犯错误。前两年北大化学系的苏联专家就批评说：你们为什么要翻译那么多教本，为什么你们自己不编写，其实你们是完全能够自己编写的；你们应该翻译一些专集，那是真正有科学价值的东西。”
    学生质量为什么低了？
      “我还想谈一个常常烦扰我的问题，”傅鹰教授说，“那就是学生的质量。”他认为，拿化学物理这两门来看，现在的学生程度比以前差多了。论学习态度的严肃，现在的学生比过去任何时期都好。但是就是缺乏独立思考的能力。过去的学生还可以和教师共同讨论，现在却不行，学生把先生的话都当作金科玉律，最好只有一家之言。学生不但外文差，就是中文也不熟练；写篇报告而能达意就已经很少了（当然文科学生可能好一些）。“我也看过一些研究生考试的卷子，成绩好一点的差不多都是解放前毕业的。选取的留学生程度也很低。当然，过去的留学生也有很糟的，但那是说人情通过的；真正凭本领考上的都很强。我在美国指导过三个美国研究生，成绩都很好，有一个现在已成了小小的权威。回国后我指导过十四个中国研究生，若说我指导他们不如指导美国学生尽心，杀了我的头也不承认。但是他们的成绩就差得多。论导师，都是我一个人。论大学毕业时的水平，都差不多。但是为什么三四年后成绩差这么远呢？我看原因至少有两个：一是我们的学生在外文方面要吃很大的亏。现在理化方面的科学文献，英文的最多，其次是俄文和德文。我们的学生外文都很差，这就受限制，还有一个原因是我们的学生动手不行——轻视实验。外国孩子很少不会收拾汽车，修理无线电，作木匠活的；咱们究竟是农业国，缺乏这方面的训练。瞧不起动手做实验，这是人生观问题。在这方面北大物理系比化学系还糟得多。”
      “现在的学生知识也不广博。学理工的不能谈文学，连读过红楼梦的全很少，听完一出戏很少能从艺术上加以评论的。我真奇怪，说功课压得紧吧，他们学的却比我们那时学的少。可是我们那时很少听见害神经衰弱的，现在学堂里神经衰弱很普遍。我们朋友间每次谈起怎样减轻学生的紧张程度这个问题，都是毫无结果，不欢而散。”
    “我说这确是一个问题，我们现在的学习效率、工作效率都很差。”傅鹰教授举了一个例子证明这一点。他说美国密其根大学有两万四千多人，其中化学系是个大系，可是系里只有一个干部，算是秘书。她一个人管全系的日常行政，而且绰绰有余裕，一点都不忙，系的情况了如指掌。现在北大化学系的干部至少有七、八个人，每个人都忙得晕头转向，却是一问三不知。
