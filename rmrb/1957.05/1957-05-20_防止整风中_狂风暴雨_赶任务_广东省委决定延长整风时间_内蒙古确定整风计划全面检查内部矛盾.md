Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 18th: The Guangdong Provincial Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, at its Standing Committee meeting yesterday, decided to adopt measures to ensure that both rectification and work are not neglected.

The Provincial Party Committee pointed out that a favorable situation for the rectification movement has already been formed within the province. However, there are many major tasks within the province that need to be grasped tightly. The rectification movement is an ideological education movement, and without sufficient time, the movement will show phenomena of "storms" and "rushing tasks," which is not conducive to the healthy development of the rectification movement. To this end, the meeting decided to revise the original arrangements for rectification time and appropriately extend the time for the rectification movement. The rectification of provincial-level organs was originally scheduled to begin in June and end in September, but is now changed to begin on May 20 and end in November. Organs below the county level will be postponed until after the autumn harvest, and currently, efforts will be concentrated on grasping agricultural production and striving for a bumper harvest in every possible way. Time can be spared to study documents and prepare for rectification later.

Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, 19th: In the new work plan for rectification approved on the 18th, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Chinese Communist Party determined that checking and handling contradictions among the people, checking the implementation of the principles of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision," and "building the country through diligence and thrift" will be the central content of this rectification of party organizations at all levels above the district, banner, and county in the autonomous region.

From December last year to March this year, the directly affiliated organs of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region launched a rectification movement centered on increasing production and practicing economy and streamlining institutions to oppose bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism. In this movement, five departments and bureaus and eighty-one division-level institutions were abolished and merged, and most units abolished section-level institutions. The number of staff in the autonomous region's party committee and government-level organs was reduced by 30% to 50%. Three thousand three hundred and eighty-five staff members were drawn out to appropriately strengthen the grassroots organizations at the banner, county, district, and township levels that needed strengthening. In this movement, plans for increasing production and practicing economy were also generally formulated, and expenses for office work, repairs, and purchases were greatly reduced, and the style of diligence and simplicity began to be established among the cadres. Democratic life and political and ideological education were strengthened in the work of the organs, and the leadership style and leadership methods were changed. Many leaders were able to go deep into reality to conduct investigations and research and go to the grassroots level for work in a planned and purposeful manner. Red tape was also greatly reduced.

However, in this rectification movement, due to insufficient understanding of the basic situation of the great changes in the country and the autonomous region at the current time, many problems have not been recognized as correctly handling contradictions among the people, and the people's internal contradictions existing in all aspects have not been fully examined. Many party members still have varying degrees of doubt and resistance to the principles of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" and "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision." Although bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism that are divorced from the masses and reality have been exposed and criticized, the problems have not been well resolved and still exist seriously in many departments and cadres.

In order to solve these problems, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Party Committee has re-formulated a work plan for implementing the Central Committee's instructions on the rectification movement. This plan requires party organizations and all party members in various parts of the autonomous region to earnestly study Chairman Mao's two reports at the Supreme State Conference and the Central Propaganda Work Conference, as well as the Party Central Committee's instructions on the rectification movement, and conduct work inspections and ideological inspections. The focus of the inspection should be on the implementation of the policy of handling contradictions among the people.

In checking and handling contradictions among the people, it is divided into seven aspects: workers, farmers and herdsmen, intellectuals, young students, democratic人士 (people without party affiliation), ethnic relations, and the People's Liberation Army. It also analyzes the main contradictions that currently exist in these aspects and the main reasons for the emergence of contradictions, and finds ways to deal with the contradictions. All departments and all regions should check ethnic policies, ethnic relations, and the relationship between the party and non-party members, as well as great Han chauvinism and local nationalism.

    防止整风中“狂风暴雨”“赶任务”
    广东省委决定延长整风时间
    内蒙古确定整风计划全面检查内部矛盾
    据新华社广州18日电　中共广东省委在昨天举行的常委会议上，决定采取措施来保证做到整风、工作两不误。
    省委指出，目前省内整风运动的有利形势已经形成。但是，目前省内有许多的重大的工作需要抓紧进行，而整风运动是一个思想教育运动，如果没有充分的时间，就会使运动出现“狂风暴雨”“赶任务”的现象，不利于整风运动的健康发展。为此，会议决定修改原来关于整风时间的安排，将整风运动的时间适当延长。省一级机关整风原定6月开始，9月结束，现在改为5月20日开始，11月结束。县以下机关则推迟到秋收后开始，目前集中力量抓紧农业生产，想尽一切办法争取农业大丰收，并且可以抽空学习文件，为以后整风作好准备。
    据新华社呼和浩特19日电　中共内蒙古自治区委员会在18日通过的新的整风的工作计划中，确定将检查处理人民内部矛盾、检查“百花齐放、百家争鸣”、“长期共存、互相监督”及“勤俭建国”方针的贯彻执行情况，作为自治区的区、旗、县以上各级党组织这次整风的中心内容。
    内蒙古自治区直属机关从去年12月到今年3月，曾开展了以增产节约和精简机构为中心的反对官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义的整风运动。在这次运动中，撤销与合并了五个厅、局和八十一个处一级机构，大部分单位撤销了科一级机构。自治区党委和政府一级机关削减编制30％到50％。抽出三千三百八十五名工作人员，适当加强了需要加强的旗、县、区、乡级的基层组织。在这次运动中，还普遍制定了增产节约计划，大力缩减了办公、修缮、购置等用费，勤俭朴素的风气在干部中开始树立。机关工作中加强了民主生活、政治思想教育，领导作风和领导方法有了转变，许多领导人员都能深入实际进行调查研究，有计划有目的地到基层去工作。文牍主义也大为减少。
    但在这次整风运动中，由于对国家和自治区当前伟大变革时期的基本形势认识不足，对许多问题还未能提到正确处理人民内部矛盾上来认识，对各方面存在的人民内部矛盾问题还没有全面检查。许多党员对“百花齐放、百家争鸣”“长期共存、互相监督”的方针还有程度不同的疑虑和抵触情绪。对脱离群众、脱离实际的官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义，虽作了揭发批判，但问题没有得到很好的解决，并且在许多部门和干部中仍然严重的存在着。
    为了解决这些问题，中共内蒙古自治区党委会重新制定了关于执行中央关于整风运动的指示的工作计划。这个计划要求自治区各地党组织和全体党员要认真学习毛主席在最高国务会议和中央宣传工作会议上的两个报告以及党中央关于整风运动的指示，并进行工作检查和思想检查。检查的重点应放在处理人民内部矛盾方针的贯彻执行上。
    在检查处理人民内部矛盾问题中，分工人、农牧民、知识分子、青年学生、民主人士、民族关系和解放军七个方面，并分析这些方面当前所存在的主要矛盾和产生矛盾的主要原因，找出处理矛盾的办法。所有部门和所有地区，都应检查民族政策、民族关系和党与非党关系‘以及大民族主义和地方民族主义思想。
