    The deeds of Communist Party member Qiu Xiqian, who is known for his hard work, simplicity, self-discipline, and devotion to public service, are widely circulated among cadres and the masses in Yexian County, Shandong Province.

    Qiu Xiqian is currently the manager of the local state-owned Yexian Yuxin Straw Braid Factory. As early as ten years ago, when he was the district chief of the Guoliang District in this county, his style of sharing weal and woe with the masses was loved and respected by the people. At that time, many farmers saw that he dressed and ate the same as them and that he also had a good hand for farm work, so they all liked to approach him and make friends with him.

    In the past two years, Qiu Xiqian's life has remained as frugal as ever: the faded gray coarse cloth quilt on his bed was issued by the public before the implementation of the salary system, and it has been used for six or seven years. The bedding on the bed is also very thin. Originally, he slept on a bed, but later he found that two workers did not have beds, so he gave his bed to them and slept on a door panel supported by two broken stools. As for what he eats and wears, he pays even less attention to it.

    The factory's employees love him very much and sometimes give him advice, suggesting that he improve his life a little. But he always refuses to pay attention to it. If they urge him too much, he only has those few old words: We must never be divorced from the masses, we should compare our lives with those below us, there are still many people whose lives are not as good as ours!

    Looking downward in terms of living standards is a principle that Qiu Xiqian has consistently adhered to. Last year, when the factory was reforming the wage system, many employees were considering how much they might be raised, but Manager Qiu was considering something else. He proposed that his wage level should be lowered from the then eighteenth grade to the twenty-third or fourth grade, arguing that his work ability was "about the same as that of comrades at the twenty-fourth grade" and that he had "no financial burden," so he could not spend all the money he received at the eighteenth-grade level. His opinion was not approved.

    In fact, Manager Qiu has quite a few family members, and he sometimes goes home to visit and leaves some money for his family. But he is unwilling to leave more money for his family, so as not to let his family's life deviate from the level of the local masses. Last spring, when he returned home, the cadres of the village's agricultural cooperative told him that the cooperative did not have money to buy peanut seeds and were afraid that it would delay the sowing season, so he lent the money he originally planned to leave for his family to the cooperative.

    So, what does Qiu Xiqian do with the money he saves by living frugally? This is a question that many people often ask when they are spreading the story of Qiu Xiqian's deeds. Recently, when reporters visited the factory, they learned that very few of the factory's employees have not borrowed money from him. No matter who has difficulties, as long as they tell him, they are guaranteed to be able to borrow money. Some people even used Manager Qiu's money without knowing it. For example, young female worker Wang Jinying spent more than fifty yuan when she was hospitalized the year before last, and she was unable to afford it. The factory helped her solve most of it, but she was still short fifteen or sixteen yuan. Manager Qiu secretly paid for her, but she never knew.

    The total amount of public bonds purchased by Manager Qiu in recent years has reached more than a thousand yuan. But the factory's accountant told reporters that this is only a rough figure, because for many years, Manager Qiu has never collected interest on his public bonds, nor has he checked the winning numbers. He doesn't even think about how much he has bought.

    生活向下看齐的人
    新华社记者　康宁
    共产党员丘希谦艰苦朴素、克己奉公的事迹，在山东省掖县的干部和群众中广泛地传颂着。
    丘希谦现在地方国营掖县育新草辫工厂任经理。早在十年以前他在本县郭梁区担任区长的时候，他那同群众共甘苦的作风，就受到人们的爱戴和尊敬。当时有很多农民看他穿的吃的都跟自己一样，并且还有一手好庄稼活，就都喜欢接近他，跟他交朋友。
    最近这两年，丘希谦的生活依然是那末俭朴：他床上的那条褪了色的灰粗布被子，还是实行薪金制以前公家发的，已经盖了六、七年了。床上铺的也很薄。本来他睡的是一张床，后来他发现有两个工人没有床位，就把自己的床让给了他们，自己睡在用两条破凳子支起来的门板上。至于他吃的、穿的，就更不讲究了。
    厂里的职工们很疼爱他，有时给他提意见，建议他把生活改善一些。但是他总不肯理会。如果催得他急了，他只有那几句老话：我们永远不可脱离群众，生活应该向下比，不如我们的生活的人还多着呢！
    在生活方面要向下看齐，是丘希谦一贯坚持的原则。去年厂里进行工资改革的时候，有很多职工都在考虑自己可能提高多少，可是丘经理考虑的却是另外一回事，他提出他的工资级别应该由当时的十八级下调到二十三、四级，理由是自己的工作能力“和二十四级的同志差不多”，“又没有经济负担”，按十八级待遇领的钱也花不了。他这个意见没有得到批准。
    其实，丘经理家里还有不少人口，他有时也回家看看，给家里留些钱。可是他也不愿给家里留下更多的钱，以免家里的生活脱离当地群众的水平。去年春天他回家时，本村农业社的干部告诉他，社里没有钱买花生种子，怕要误了播种期，他就把本来打算留给家里的钱借给了社里。
    那么，丘希谦省吃俭用剩下的钱都作什么了？这是许多人在传颂丘希谦事迹时往往要提出的一个问题。最近记者到这个厂里访问了解到，原来厂里的职工很少有没借过他的钱的，无论谁发生了困难，只要给他讲一声，保准可以借到。甚至有的人用了丘经理的钱自己却不知道。比如青年女工王金英前年住院花了五十多元，自己无力负担，厂里帮助她解决了一大部分，还差十五、六元，丘经理暗暗地替她垫支了，可是她一直不知道。
    丘经理近几年来认购公债的总数已经达到了千元以上。可是厂里的会计告诉记者，这还只是个大体数字，因为好多年来，丘经理从来没领取过公债利息，也没有对过中签号码，究竟他买了多少，他连想都不去想它。
