	Dew of the Soul
	——Watching the Film "A Poem of Education"
	Qiao Yu
	The most beautiful poem in the world is the dew that nourishes the soul, like a clear spring flowing into a barren valley, and thirsty seeds growing into blossoms, fragrant grasses, lush forests, and tall bamboos...
	Makarenko wrote just such a poem. He nourished human dignity with the dew of his soul. When he first met the children, it was like walking into a terrifying wilderness. A cluster of seedlings trampled by horses' hooves trembled in the wind, enduring disaster. In their eyes, there was only hostility. On their bodies, there was no mother's needlework; lice gnawed at their bodies, and disaster gnawed at their souls. Stealing was degeneration. They did not know dirtiness was unseemly. They did not know bullying the young was shameful. They did not know culture was the glory of human labor. They did not know, did not know…
	What can be used to open a confined soul? What can be used to nourish a withered seedling? Makarenko encountered such problems. Makarenko could answer. The Bolsheviks encountered such problems. The Bolsheviks could answer.
	Use human confidence to inspire confidence, use human care to win care, use the dew of the soul to nourish the soul, and use love to ignite love.
	Unhappy vagrant children, you are fortunate. Makarenko used this key of life to open the solemn gate of life for you.
	Withered seedlings, you are fortunate. In the fertile soil of the Soviets, all life shines brightly.
