Xinhua News Agency, 23rd Dispatch: The Third National Congress of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League continued on the afternoon of the 23rd. Vice Premier of the State Council Li Fuchun delivered a report on building the country through diligence and thrift at the meeting.

Li Fuchun first congratulated the Youth League on its upcoming renaming to the Communist Youth League, congratulated the Youth League on becoming the core of uniting national youth to strive for socialism and communism, and congratulated Youth League members on becoming brave fighters striving for communism. Li Fuchun pointed out that our country's socialist construction is an extremely glorious and great undertaking that predecessors have never done before. Our construction policy is to work hard and build the country diligently and thriftily, and the success of socialist construction depends on the current young generation.

After Li Fuchun thoroughly explained the policy of building the country through diligence and thrift, he pointed out that whether the arrangement of economic construction is appropriate is related to the issue of 600 million people. Appropriate arrangements can reduce and help resolve internal contradictions among the people. With a spirit of self-criticism, Li Fuchun explained that the idea of blindly emphasizing "socialist standards" in some aspects, pursuing grandiosity, novelty, high quality, and excessiveness, while being detached from China's economic level, industrial level, and people's living standards, is wrong, and called on people to work hard with their hands to create a socialist society.

When talking about how to implement the policy of building the country through diligence and thrift, Li Fuchun said: First, our technical policy in construction is that, except for some necessary factories and mines that are equipped with modern technology, others can only adopt general technical levels and cannot demand modernization in everything; second, in terms of construction scale, we must combine large, medium, and small, with medium and small being the main focus, and cannot make everything large; third, construction standards should emphasize economy and applicability; fourth, except for modern large enterprises that are helped by fraternal countries, medium and small enterprises should design and manufacture equipment themselves; fifth, industry and handicrafts should be combined, and we must not blindly pursue mechanization; sixth, in urban construction, we must proceed from reality, cooperate with economic construction, develop gradually, and make full use of existing cities as much as possible.

As an old Communist Youth League member, Li Fuchun finally hoped that League members would study Marxism-Leninism hard, establish a communist outlook on life, carry forward the glorious traditions of Chinese youth who are not afraid of sacrifice, not afraid of difficulties, do not covet fame and wealth, work hard for the country and the people, and at the same time, work hard, especially participate in physical labor, and become workers and peasants who combine mental and physical labor.

A total of nine representatives spoke at the meeting today.

Wang Chuanbin, Deputy Minister of the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee of the Youth League, talked about how the Youth League should strengthen cooperation with the Democratic Youth Federation and how to strengthen the unity of youth from all walks of life.

Chen Lian, Minister of the School and Young Pioneers Work Department of the Central Committee of the Youth League, spoke on several issues in the current Young Pioneers work.

Jing Mian, Minister of the Organization Department of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Youth League, proposed the issue of strengthening unity with returned overseas Chinese students in his speech.

Tao Jixian, a representative of the Youth League branch of the China Blind Welfare Association, read out a congratulatory letter from blind youth at the meeting.

    李富春在青年团代表大会上号召团员
    团结全国青年勤俭建国
    据新华社23日讯　中国新民主主义青年团第三次全国代表大会在23日下午继续举行。国务院副总理李富春在会上作了关于勤俭建国的报告。
    李富春首先祝贺青年团将要改名为共产主义青年团，祝贺青年团成为团结全国青年为社会主义和共产主义奋斗的核心，祝贺青年团员成为为共产主义而奋斗的勇敢战士。李富春指出，我国的社会主义建设是前人从来没有做过的极其光荣伟大的事业，我们建设的方针就是艰苦奋斗、勤俭建国，而社会主义建设的成功要依靠现在的青年一代。
    李富春详尽地阐明了勤俭建国的方针后指出，经济建设的安排是否恰当，是关系六亿人民的问题。安排得恰当，就可以减少和有助于解决人民内部矛盾。李富春以自我批评的精神，说明那种脱离中国经济水平、工业水平和人民生活水平，在某些方面盲目讲究“社会主义标准”，贪大、贪新、贪好、贪多的想法是错误的，并且号召用双手努力缔造社会主义社会。
    李富春在谈到如何贯彻执行勤俭建国的方针时说，第一、我们在建设中的技术政策是除了一些必要的厂矿用现代的技术来装备以外，其他的只能采用一般的技术水平，不能样样要求现代化；第二、在建设的规模上，要大中小结合，而以中小型为主，不能一切都大；第三、建筑标准要讲究节约和适用；第四、除了现代化的大企业请兄弟国家帮助建设以外，中小型企业均应自己设计，自制设备；第五、工业和手工业相结合，不能盲目追求机械化；第六、在城市建设方面，要从现实出发，要配合经济建设，逐步发展，并且尽量利用现有的城市。
    李富春作为一个老共青团员，最后希望团员们要努力学习马克思列宁主义，树立共产主义人生观；发扬中国青年不怕牺牲、不怕困难、不贪名利、为国为民、艰苦奋斗的光荣传统；同时，要努力劳动，特别是参加体力劳动，成为脑力劳动和体力劳动相结合的工人和农民。
    今天在大会上发言的代表共九人。
    青年团中央统战部副部长王传斌的发言中，谈到了青年团如何加强和民主青年联合会的合作，如何加强各界青年的团结等问题。
    青年团中央学校和少先队工作部部长陈琏就目前少先队工作中的几个问题作了发言。
    青年团广东省高等学校委员会组织部部长荆勉在发言中提出要加强和归国华侨学生团结的问题。
    中国盲人福利会团支部代表陶季贤在会上宣读了盲人青年的贺信。
