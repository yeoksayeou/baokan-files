The Freedom of American Writers
　　Feng Yidai

Hollywood is looking for a screenwriter named Robert Rich.

Not long ago, a movie appeared in Hollywood. The movie advertising was very simple, only saying that it was a film depicting the deep feelings between a child and a bull, and did not use the scantily clad starlets customary in American movie advertisements for promotion. The title was also very simple, called "The Brave One". After the film was released, it immediately caused a sensation, especially loved by child movie fans. On the list of nominees for the Academy Awards presented by the American Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences every year, this film gradually surpassed other films and ranked among the top, and finally won the Golden Statue Award for the best movie story. However, who exactly is the screenwriter of this film, Robert Rich? Hollywood legends abound, and there is no consensus. Presenting the Golden Statue Award without anyone to receive it is something that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has never experienced since its establishment twenty-nine years ago, putting the Academy in extreme difficulty.

The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences had done a rather unseemly thing: when the film "Friendly Persuasion" written by screenwriter Michael Wilson had hope of winning an award, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences specially established a clear rule, saying that anyone who openly resisted the Congressional Committee on Un-American Activities could not win an award. Wilson was a film screenwriter persecuted by American fascists, and also a well-known figure in the Hollywood Ten case that caused a sensation that year. This rule was set up to prevent him from winning an award. The producer of "Friendly Persuasion" was also frightened and dared not write the screenwriter's name on the film credits. However, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences was very confident about "The Brave One" because they already knew that there was indeed a Robert Rich in Hollywood, and that this person had also promised to personally attend the awards ceremony. However, contrary to their wishes, when it came to the day of the award, this Robert Rich was nowhere to be found, and this precious Golden Statue Award had to be accepted on his behalf by the Writers Guild.

This person who claimed to be Robert Rich was obviously a man of conscience. He later told the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences that he was an accountant, not a screenwriter, and that he had never written a screenplay; since he was not a screenwriter, even if he attended the awards ceremony, it would not solve the problem.

This made the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences flustered. All the Academy's legal advisors unanimously suspected that this screenwriter who refused to reveal his true identity was likely a figure in the Hollywood Ten case who opposed the Congressional Committee on Un-American Activities.

The "Variety" reporter in Hollywood interviewed Dalton Trumbo, another screenwriter in the Hollywood Ten case, and directly asked him if he was Robert Rich. Trumbo said he was not. But "Variety" and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences could not verify whether Trumbo's answer was correct. Because when the "Variety" reporter asked Trumbo, his answer was:
　　"Hell, no, I'm Trumbo."

However, Trumbo's mischievous tone made the reporter a little worried. Trumbo said:
　　"Robert Rich is Michael Wilson. Wilson knew that his 'Friendly Persuasion' had no chance of winning an award, so he wrote 'The Brave One' to show off his skills."

So, did Trumbo write "The Brave One"?

Trumbo said: "I have written many screenplays, so I have long adopted this method: if the film is good, then I neither admit nor deny that it is my work. By doing this, I can share the honor of successful works and avoid condemnation for failed works."

Therefore, precisely because "The Brave One" is so good, he "dare not" deny it. He said:
　　"This film has no massacres, no drug use, no seduction of young girls, no gunfights, and no moral depravity. In fact, I really don't know how such a story could be made into a movie."

Trumbo also said: "Today I received a phone call from New York, asking me to write a script about the story of finding Robert Rich. Naturally, this story is a farce, but unless we get information about Robert Rich, I cannot start writing. I am also doing my best to find this person."

Asking the film's producers, the King brothers, also yielded nothing. Frank King said that there was indeed a man named Robert Rich, who was a photographer and writer with a goatee, who is now traveling in Europe, but his whereabouts are unknown.

To this day, the Oscar Golden Statue Award is still stored in a cold storage. But Academy host George Seaton would rather Robert Rich never appear. Because if he is really a figure in the Hollywood Ten case, things will be even more difficult.

American newspapers call this matter a "ghost story," and the person named "ghost" is obviously one of the outstanding screenwriters who was forced to go underground due to the fascist behavior of the Committee on Un-American Activities. The appearance of the "ghost" writer shows the plight of progressive writers in the United States, and also shows their unyielding struggle. For us Chinese writers who live in an environment of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," this story is naturally incredible. But this is the reality in the "free world," and it is also a powerful satire on the so-called "freedom" of the United States.

[Note] In 1947, the American fascist Committee on Un-American Activities decided to expel all progressive film workers from Hollywood, and summoned ten progressive screenwriters and directors including Maltz, Lawson, Trumbo, and Wilson. Because they refused to answer questions, they were all tried for "contempt of Congress" and sentenced to imprisonment.

    美国作家的自由
    冯亦代
    好莱坞正在找寻一位名叫罗伯特·李奇的电影剧作家。
    不久前，好莱坞出现了一部电影。电影广告做得很朴素，只说是部描写一个小孩和一条雄牛之间深厚感情的影片，没有用美国电影广告惯例中穿坦胸露臂衣服的小明星作宣传。片名也很简单，就叫“勇敢的人”。影片上映之后，立刻哄动一时，特别为儿童影迷所喜爱。在美国电影艺术学院每年颁发奥斯卡奖的候选名单上，这张影片逐渐越过其他影片而名列前茅，最后终于获得了最佳电影故事的金像奖。但是，究竟谁是这张影片的剧作家罗伯特·李奇呢？好莱坞传说纷纭，莫衷一是。颁发金像奖而无领奖之人，这是电影艺术学院自成立二十九年以来，从未经历过的事情，使学院陷于极度困难之中。
    电影艺术学院曾经做过一件不大体面的事情：即在剧作家迈克尔·威尔逊所写“亲切的劝告”一片有获奖希望时，电影艺术学院特别立了一条清规戒律，说凡是公开反抗国会非美活动调查委员会的人，都不能得奖。威尔逊是受美国法西斯迫害的电影剧作家，也是当年哄动一时的好莱坞十人案其中的知名人物。这一条也就是为了不让他得奖而设的。“亲切的劝告”的制片人也吓得在电影片头上不敢写出剧作家的名字。可是对于“勇敢的人”，电影艺术学院很有把握，因为他们早已知道好莱坞确有罗伯特·李奇其人，而且这个人还答应亲自参加给奖大会。不过事与愿违，临到给奖那天，这位罗伯特·李奇却杳无踪迹，这座名贵的金像奖，也不得不由剧作家协会出面代领。
    这位自称是罗伯特·李奇的显然是个有良心的人，他事后告诉电影艺术学院说，他是个会计师，不是个剧作家，而且他也从来没有写过电影剧本；既然不是写剧本的人，即便他出席给奖大会，也不能解决问题。
    这一来，却使电影艺术学院手忙脚乱了，所有学院的法律顾问，都一致怀疑，这位不肯一露庐山真面目的剧作家，很可能就是反对国会非美活动调查委员会的好莱坞十人案中的人物。
    好莱坞的“杂耍”周刊记者访问了十人案中的另一位剧作家达尔顿·屈仑波，直截了当问他是否就是罗伯特·李奇，屈仑波说不是他。可是“杂耍”周刊和电影艺术学院都不能证实屈仑波的回答究竟对不对。因为“杂耍”记者问到屈仑波时，他的回答是：
      “见鬼，不是的，我是屈仑波。”
    可是，屈仑波的恶作剧的论调，却又使记者有些伤脑筋。屈仑波说：
      “罗伯特·李奇就是迈克尔·威尔逊。威尔逊知道他的‘亲切的劝告’没有机会获奖，就写了‘勇敢的人’来显显他的身手。”
    那末，屈仑波有没有写过“勇敢的人”呢？
    屈仑波说：“我曾经写过许多电影剧本，因此久矣夫我采取了这样一个办法：如果影片很好，那我就既不承认，也不否认这是我的作品。这么办，我可以对成功之作分享荣誉，对失败之作不受谴责。”
    因此，正由于“勇敢的人”如此之好，他就“不敢”否认了。他说：
      “这部影片既不惨杀、又不吸毒，既未诱奸少女，又无枪击场面，更没有道德的堕落。事实上，我真不知道怎么会让这样的故事拍成电影的。”
    屈仑波还说：“今天纽约还有电话来，要我把找寻罗伯特·李奇的故事写成剧本。自然啰，这个故事是出闹剧，可是除非我们得到有关罗伯特·李奇的消息，否则我就无法动笔。我也正竭尽棉力在找寻这个人。”
    去问这部电影的制片人金氏兄弟，也不得要领。法兰克·金说，的确有那末一位名叫罗伯特·李奇的人，他是个摄影家、作家，留山羊胡子的，现在正在欧洲旅行，可是行踪不知。
    至今，这座奥斯卡金像奖还保藏在保冷库里。但是学院主持人乔治·西顿，却宁愿罗伯特·李奇永不出现。因为如果他真是十人案中的人物，事情就更难办了。
    美国的报纸把这件事名之为“鬼故事”，而被命名为“鬼”的人，显然是那些因非美活动调查委员会的法西斯行为而被迫潜入地下的优秀剧作家之一。“鬼”作家的出现，说明美国进步作家的处境，也显示出他们的不屈斗争。对我们生活在“百花齐放、百家争鸣”环境中的中国作家，这个故事自然是不可思议的。但这正是“自由世界”中的现实生活，也是对美国的所谓“自由”的一个有力的讽刺。
    〔注〕1947年美国法西斯的非美活动调查委员会决定把好莱坞的进步电影工作者全部驱逐出去，就传讯了马尔兹、劳逊、屈仑波、威尔逊等十位进步的剧作家和导演。由于他们拒绝答复询问，都以“对国会不敬”罪而受审，并被判徒刑。
