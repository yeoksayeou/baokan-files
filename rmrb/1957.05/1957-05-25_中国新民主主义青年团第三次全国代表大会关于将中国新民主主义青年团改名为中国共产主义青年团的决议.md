    Resolution of the Third National Congress of the China New Democratic Youth League on Changing the Name of the China New Democratic Youth League to the Communist Youth League of China
    (Passed by the Third National Congress of the China New Democratic Youth League – May 24, 1957)
    After carefully discussing the proposal submitted by the Second Central Committee of the League to the Congress for deliberation on changing the name of the League, the Congress believes that, since the New Democratic Revolution has long been completed in most parts of our country, and the socialist revolution has also achieved a decisive victory, the China New Democratic Youth League has completed its historical mission. The vast number of League members are working diligently to build our country into a great socialist industrial power, and regard the realization of communism in the future as their lofty ideal. Under these circumstances, it is no longer appropriate to continue to call our League the China New Democratic Youth League. In order to accurately reflect the political tasks undertaken by our League and the will of the vast number of League members, the Congress unanimously adopted the resolution to change the name of the China New Democratic Youth League to the Communist Youth League of China.
    The Congress also believes that, in order to inherit and carry forward the glorious tradition of the youth movement in our country, the National Congress of the League after the change of name should be connected with the past National Congresses of the Chinese Socialist Youth League, the Chinese Communist Youth League, and the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, and arranged in order. The next National Congress of the League will be named the Ninth National Congress of the Communist Youth League of China.

    中国新民主主义青年团第三次全国代表大会关于将中国新民主主义青年团改名为中国共产主义青年团的决议
    （中国新民主主义青年团第三次全国代表大会通过——1957年5月24日）
    大会在认真讨论了团的二届中央委员会提交大会审议的更改团的名称的建议以后，认为，由于新民主主义革命在我国绝大部分地区早已完成，社会主义革命也已经取得决定性的胜利，中国新民主主义青年团已经完成自己的历史任务，广大团员正在为把我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义工业强国而辛勤地劳动着，并且把在将来实现共产主义当作自己崇高的理想，在这种情况下，再把我们团的名称继续叫作中国新民主主义青年团已经不合适了。为了确切地反映我们团所担负的政治任务和广大团员的意志，大会一致通过将中国新民主主义青年团改名为中国共产主义青年团。
    大会并且认为，为了继承和发扬我国青年运动的光荣传统，应该将改名以后团的全国代表大会和过去的中国社会主义青年团、中国共产主义青年团以及中国新民主主义青年团历次全国代表大会相衔接，依照次序加以排列，把下一次团的全国代表大会定名为中国共产主义青年团第九次全国代表大会。
