　　Benbao Wuhan, 4th. This afternoon at 2:59 PM, the final girder of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge was installed at the No. 6 pier in the center of the river. A bridge over one kilometer long was connected across the turbulent Yangtze River, uniting the three towns of Wuhan. Bridge workers, who had been working tirelessly on the banks of Tortoise Mountain in Hanyang and Snake Mountain in Wuchang, rushed to the spot to shake hands and embrace, warmly celebrating the basic completion of the Yangtze River Bridge construction project. From now on, the day when the entire bridge is completed and trains can pass over it is drawing ever closer.

　　In the days leading up to the moment when only a small gap remained in the steel beams of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, discussions filled the streets and alleys of Wuhan: "The Yangtze River Bridge is about to be finished." Each time boats passed near the Yangtze River Bridge, people would crowd the railings, intently watching the rapidly progressing project. This afternoon, citizens of Wuhan, filled with boundless excitement, crowded the embankments of Wuchang and Tortoise Mountain in Hanyang to witness the grand event of the joining of the Yangtze River Bridge steel beams.

　　At 2:20 PM this afternoon, the celebration ceremony for the joining of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge steel beams began. Amidst the deafening sound of firecrackers, the final upper chord member on the downstream side of the No. 6 pier was slowly lifted under the lenses of color film cameras, and was installed at 2:59 PM. When Peng Min, Director of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau, announced, "The steel beams of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge have joined, the entire bridge is connected," a group of female workers and elementary school students presented beautiful flowers to the Soviet experts who made outstanding contributions to the construction of the Yangtze River Bridge. Immediately, bouquets of flowers were passed to the bridge workers on top of the steel beams. Then, thousands of people walked across the bridge in droves, gathering at the Tortoise Mountain bridgehead, where a rally of 8,000 workers was held to celebrate the steel beam joining.

　　At the meeting, Minister of Railways Teng Daiyuan, First Secretary of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Wang Renzhong, Secretary of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Li Erzhong, and the person in charge of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau all spoke. They extended warm congratulations and thanks to the Soviet experts, Chinese engineers, and all workers who participated in the construction of the Yangtze River Bridge. Teng Daiyuan also mentioned in his speech that during China's Second Five-Year Plan, the Zhengzhou Yellow River Double-Track Bridge, the Tongguan Yellow River Pontoon Bridge, and the Chongqing Yangtze River Bridge will also be built. He called on all employees to be diligent and thrifty, work hard, and strive to build more bridges.

　　To celebrate the joining of the steel beams, the Chinese and Soviet bridge builders of the Engineering Bureau held a friendly get-together this evening.

    一桥飞架南北天堑变通途
    长江大桥钢梁合龙　武汉三镇连成一体
    本报武汉4日电　今天下午两点五十九分，武汉长江大桥钢梁在江心六号墩处架好最后一根杆件，一座长达一公里多的大桥在波浪滚滚的长江上接通了，武汉三镇连成一体了。长期分别坚持在汉阳龟山、武昌蛇山两岸工作的桥梁工人，都涌到这里握手拥抱，热烈庆祝长江大桥的建设工程基本完成。从此，全桥建成和火车通过大桥的日子越来越近了。
    前几天，当武汉长江大桥的钢梁架设得只剩一个小缺口时，武汉街头巷尾就议论纷纷：“长江大桥快架成了”。江里的船只每次开过长江大桥附近，人们就拥挤在船舷边上出神地观看这个进展迅速的工程。今天下午，武汉市民怀着无比兴奋的心情，拥挤在武昌岸堤和汉阳龟山上，观看长江大桥钢梁合龙的盛举。
    今天下午二时二十分，武汉长江大桥钢梁合龙的庆祝仪式宣布开始，在震天的鞭炮声中，六号墩处靠下游的最后一根上弦杆便在彩色影片摄影机的镜头下，缓缓上升，到两点五十九分便架设完毕。当长江大桥工程局长彭敏宣布“武汉长江大桥钢梁合龙，全桥接通了”的时候，一群女职工和小学生把美丽的鲜花献给在长江大桥建设中做了杰出贡献的苏联专家们，顿时，一束束花朵又传到了钢梁顶上的桥梁工人手中。接着，成千的人群，便熙熙攘攘走过桥梁，汇集在龟山桥头，八千职工参加的庆祝钢梁合龙的大会就在这里举行。
    会上，铁道部长滕代远、中共湖北省委第一书记王任重、中共武汉市委书记李尔重和武汉长江大桥工程局的负责人分别讲了话。他们对参加长江大桥建设的苏联专家、中国工程师和全体工人致以热烈祝贺和谢意。滕代远在讲话中还特别谈到，在我国第二个五年计划中，还要修建郑州黄河复线桥，潼关黄河便桥，重庆长江大桥等。他号召全体职工克勤克俭，艰苦奋斗，为修建更多的桥梁而努力。
　　为了庆祝钢梁合龙，今天晚间工程局的中苏桥梁建设者举行了友谊的联欢。
