    Xinhua News Agency, Yumen, 4th - The Party Secretary, Deputy Party Secretary, Factory Director, Deputy Factory Director, Chairman of the Trade Union, Deputy Secretary of the Communist Youth League, Chief Engineer, Deputy Chief Engineer, and Deputy Chief Geologist of the Yumen Oilfield's Oil Extraction Plant, a total of ten people, recently read the Xinhua News Agency's report "Many Factory Leaders in Shanghai Abandon Bonuses." They unanimously agreed that the salaries of the leading cadres of the Oil Extraction Plant were higher than those of ordinary workers. They should respond to the Party's call to promote the spirit of hard work and plain living and share weal and woe with the masses. They decided to no longer receive the bonuses they were entitled to for fulfilling the production plan, starting from April.

    玉门采油厂领导人员放弃奖金
    据新华社玉门4日电　玉门油矿采油厂的党委书记、副书记，厂长、副厂长，工会主席，团委副书记，总工程师、副总工程师，副总地质师等十人，最近看了新华社发的“上海很多工厂领导干部放弃奖金”的消息以后，一致认为采油厂领导干部的工资较一般职工高，应该响应党的发扬艰苦朴素作风、同群众共甘苦的号召，决定从4月份起再不领取因完成生产计划而应得的奖金了。
