    Can the Dormitory Shortage Be Solved Quickly?
    --An Investigation of Employee Housing in Anshan
    Written collectively by Xinhua News Agency reporters stationed in Anshan
    In the early stages of large-scale construction in Anshan, the steel capital, employees felt the lack of housing. To solve this problem, the state has invested tremendous manpower and resources over the years, and tens of thousands of employees have obtained new housing. However, the current situation of housing falling short of demand is causing more families and lovers to suffer. What is the reason for this? Is there a way to satisfy everyone who hopes to reunite with their families in the short term? The reporter conducted the following investigation for this purpose:
    The Past and Present of Housing
    Anyone who has been to Anshan has this feeling: in Anshan, newly built employee dormitories are not single buildings, but large areas. Along Victory Road, which is more than ten miles long, new three-story and four-story buildings stand densely on both sides; on the farmland near the city, workers' residential areas such as Taiping Village and Changdianpu have now been built, housing sixty to seventy thousand people. According to statistics from the Anshan Municipal Statistics Bureau, from liberation to 1956, the state had built more than 1.6 million square meters of dormitories for Anshan's employees. The number of employees living in family dormitories in Anshan Iron and Steel and Anshan Metallurgical Construction Corporation alone increased from 8,146 households in 1949 to more than 55,000 households now.
    This is Anshan today. The situation in Anshan during the Japanese puppet rule was very different. People will not forget that at that time, only about 100,000 square meters of dormitory space was provided for 130,000 Chinese workers. At that time, the conditions for allocating family dormitories were very strict, one of which was that one must have worked for more than three years. In fact, due to poor working conditions, there were very few workers who worked for more than three years, so on average, each Chinese worker only got less than 0.8 square meters; while now, the average employee has about 8 square meters of housing, just from the newly built dormitories after liberation. The quality of the dormitories is also very different. At that time, most of the dormitories were dark and damp simple houses; now, they are generally brick and wood-structured buildings.
    How Did the Contradiction Arise?
    Since liberation, although the housing area in Anshan has increased year by year, the contradiction between employees and state-owned enterprises has not eased in terms of housing issues. On the contrary, it has become increasingly acute. In early 1954, more than 15,000 people in the production and capital construction departments of Anshan Iron and Steel Company requested the allocation of family housing. In the three years from then until the end of 1956, the state built more than 600,000 square meters of housing, which, according to general standards, was enough to accommodate more than 20,000 employee households. However, the number of people applying for family housing has not decreased as a result, but has instead increased to more than 25,000. The more houses are built, the less sufficient they are. In the housing management department, in the offices of managers, factory directors, and party committee secretaries, people applying for family housing often gather.
    Some employees brought their wives to the leading cadres and slammed the table and shouted.
    Some demobilized soldiers said, "For the revolution, for the country, I fought north and south, braving life and death. Now the peaceful construction has begun. The Communist Party doesn't want me to be a monk soldier. Can you still ask me to be a monk worker? Give me family housing!"
    Some employees who have made inventions or exceeded quotas have also shown off their achievements and asked the leaders for houses.
    Employees without outstanding performance are also impatient when applying to the leadership for houses. They said, "The Communist Party cares about the hardships of the workers, but you don't care about me. This is bureaucracy!"
    The situation of the supply of family housing falling short of demand is so serious that it has become one of the contradictions between leaders and those being led within the enterprise. The essence of this contradiction is the contradiction between the immediate interests of some employees and the long-term interests of the country. According to the materials from the reporter's investigation, the reasons for the formation of this contradiction are as follows:
    (1) In the past few years, the production and construction departments have all increased the number of employees to varying degrees, with approximately 30,000 new employees added in the last two years alone. Last year, the production and construction departments built more than 200,000 square meters of housing, which, in principle, could meet the needs of the newly recruited employees. However, because most of them require family dormitories, it is still difficult to solve the problem.
    The increasing number of people requiring family dormitories is the most important reason for the housing supply shortage. According to a survey by relevant departments of Anshan Iron and Steel, employees assigned to family housing accounted for 23% of all employees in 1950. From then until 1956, most of the increased employees were new workers or unmarried young workers. However, the proportion of employees living in family dormitories not only did not relatively decrease as a result, but gradually increased to 34%; on the contrary, the proportion of employees living in single dormitories decreased from 22.8% of the total number of employees to about 18% during this period. According to the current living standards, single dormitories generally occupy 3.5 square meters of living space per person, while family dormitories average 14.9 square meters of living space per household, which means that the latter occupies more than three times as much housing as the former.
    After conducting extensive investigations and research, the reporter believes that many of those who have been allocated or are applying for family housing are reasonable, and some are in urgent need. In departments with conditions, we should help solve the problem as much as possible. For example, older demobilized soldiers, couples who have been separated for a long time after marriage and are in distant places, etc. However, there are also a large number of employees whose objective need for family housing is not urgent. For example, many young people who have just passed the age of twenty are eager to get married and apply for family housing. For example, the Anshan Iron and Steel Second Medium Plate Plant, which is under construction, has more than 600 workers. So far, 200 households have been allocated family housing, most of whom are old workers transferred from brother factories. Currently, there are 124 demobilized soldiers and 36 old workers who are still applying for family housing, as well as 70 new workers who only entered the factory last year. According to the person in charge of the factory, at least half of these 230 applicants may be able to overcome difficulties and solve the problem themselves: the new workers have not yet started working, and it was made clear when they joined the factory that family housing could not be provided, so their requirements cannot be met now; most of the demobilized soldiers are older, and we should help them solve the family housing problem as soon as possible under possible conditions. However, under the current circumstances where national funds and building materials are limited, 53 of them originally lived along the railway near Anshan, which is convenient to get from the factory to home. Even if they don't live in public housing, they can often reunite with their families. In addition, 21 people are currently living with relatives and friends, and housing difficulties can also be overcome temporarily.
    According to relevant departments, it is estimated that about one-tenth of the employees have just started working and want to bring their families or establish new families, and demand that the state allocate family housing with high requirements. This means that these comrades have not yet contributed to the country's socialist industrialization, but are reaching out to the state for family housing worth nearly a thousand yuan. At present, there are more than 200 people in the Anshan Iron and Steel Second Medium Plate Plant who require family housing, 70 of whom are newly recruited workers. Before entering the factory, they had very low requirements, as if they just needed to be recruited into the factory. But after becoming fixed workers, the requirements for family housing were immediately raised. Liu Zhongyu, a new worker, originally had his own house near Anshan, but he sold it after entering the factory and tried every means to apply to the factory for family housing. The leaders thought he was really in trouble, so they mobilized many workers to rent a house for him everywhere. As a result, they rented one in Haicheng, which also had a vegetable garden and furniture, with an annual rent of only 20 yuan. However, he didn't want it no matter what, because he thought it was too far away, and it would take an hour by train to get home. At the same time, he heard that the factory was going to build new houses this year, and it would be better to live in new houses. Later, the factory allocated this house to more than a dozen applicants, but they had the same idea as Liu Zhongyu and no one wanted it. Up to now, this house is still vacant.
    About half of the employees in Anshan are from rural areas along the railway line in Liaoyang, Haicheng, Gaiping, etc. After rural girls marry them, they move to the city in large numbers. Some people even forcibly squeeze into collective dormitories, clubs, offices... before they are allocated houses, indicating an urgent need for houses in order to force the leaders to solve the problem as soon as possible. The Anshan Iron and Steel Twenty-First Dormitory was originally for single employees, but now more than 50 workers have brought their lovers to live in it, and some have even brought their parents and brothers.
    Most of the women who came to Anshan with their husbands are newly married rural girls. They were originally members of agricultural production cooperatives, and some were even directors of women's federations, production team leaders, and branch secretaries of the Communist Youth League. These people became idlers after coming to Anshan. After Si Yong'an, a worker at the Second Steelmaking Plant, got married last year, he not only brought his 20-year-old wife Guo Hongjun, but also brought his younger brother Si Shucai, who had just graduated from elementary school, to Anshan to find a job. Guo Hongjun was originally an outstanding member of the agricultural cooperative and a member of the Communist Party of China. Si Shucai is a 20-year-old young man whose parents are farmers, but he always thinks that working in the city is better than participating in agricultural production and earns more money. For more than half a year, he has been living in the collective dormitory with his brother and sister-in-law, aimlessly looking for a job.
    (2) Anshan is a rapidly developing industrial city. In 1952, the city's population was 358,000, and now it is 700,000. The vast majority of the newly added population are employees and their families. At the same time, most of these people are young and middle-aged, so Anshan's population growth rate is more than twice as high as the national average growth rate (2.2%). Last year, a total of 39,000 babies were born in the city, and the growth rate was 5.57% based on a population of 700,000. According to the health administration department, such a high growth rate is rare in the world.
    With the increase in population, the number of people serving them—commercial workers, nannies, and relatives of employees—has also increased. These people also need a large number of new houses; at the same time, many people who originally had family housing also feel crowded and not enough to live in.
    (3) There are many rental houses in Anshan and its suburbs. About 20,000 households of production and construction workers now live in their own houses or rented private houses. However, in recent years, they have become increasingly unwilling to live in such houses. The reason is that the state's newly built houses have good living facilities, are close to the factory area, and after several rent reductions, the rent paid by employees living in public housing generally accounts for only 2% of their salary income. Some households only need a few cents per month. However, living in a private house costs two or three times as much rent. Even living in one's own house is not as cheap as living in a public house after paying for repairs. In this case, some employees sold their own houses, some even asked to hand over the property rights to the state, and some employees who rented private houses found many excuses to terminate the lease and then apply for public housing. Some of them deliberately locked the doors of their houses, threw their bedding and furniture outside the door, and then said to the leading cadres, "Look, the landlord has kicked me out. Find me another house!"
    In addition, after the proposal to carry out socialist transformation of rental houses last year, many small house renters were worried because the policy publicity was not sufficient and timely. They believed that they would also be transformed and the rent would be reduced, so they rushed to drive away the tenants (employees) so that they could live more comfortably or use the houses to raise chickens, etc. This also caused housing tension.
    Bringing a Heavy Burden to the City
    A large number of employees bringing their families into the city has turned them from laborers into pure consumers. The countryside has lost labor, and urban public utilities, food supply, schools, hospitals... are under great pressure. At present, the grain produced in the suburbs of Anshan is only enough for the city's population to eat for 20 days, and the rest must be transported from Hebei, Jiangsu, Hunan, Sichuan and other places. According to statistics from the grain department, each ton of grain loses more than 10 kilograms during long-distance transportation and storage, and the state and consumers have to pay a lot of money.
    The amount of coal used by households has also increased greatly. According to statistics from the Anshan Municipal Bureau of Commerce, an average person needs 735 kilograms of coal a year. Last year, the state mobilized more than 7,000 train cars to transport fuel for the population that has increased since 1952.
    Although the number of schools in Anshan has now developed about ten times more than before liberation, many people are still unable to enter higher education.
    Before liberation, there was only one secondary school, but now there are 20. The number of primary school students increased by 32,000 in 1956 compared to 1952, most of whom are children of employees. In terms of medical and health care, the employees in the production and construction departments originally had an average of 7.9 beds and 2.1 doctors per 1,000 people. However, due to the increase in family members, there are now only two beds and 0.5 doctors per 1,000 people, and hospitals and clinics are very crowded.
    After employees bring their families to the city, although personal life is more convenient, and some can even save expenses, many people have also increased their expenses, resulting in financial difficulties. According to a survey by the Bureau of Commerce, a low-income, relatively poor employee family has to spend an average of 6.2 yuan per person per month on staple and non-staple food, of which non-staple food accounts for 3 yuan. If they are in the countryside, they may be able to solve the non-staple food themselves.
    Zou Guangyi, a carpenter at the Chemical Plant, has a family of 11 people. Last year, his family members were all in the countryside, and his son and wife participated in agricultural labor, doing 2,800 work points a year. In addition to receiving food for the whole family after autumn, they also earned more than 80 yuan in cash. In addition, the whole family also grew a vegetable garden. Zou Guangyi took the commuter bus home every day, and gave his 74 yuan salary to his father to distribute, providing for his brothers, children and nephews to go to school. Life was still adequate.
    This spring, his wife and five children moved to Anshan. His wife can only do some housework, and his eldest son has been idle for more than two months. He only recently became a temporary worker, and the family's economic life is a bit tight. His wife recently analyzed the pros and cons of living in the city and the countryside, saying that the advantage of living in the city is that you don't have to work hard, but you have to spend money at every turn, and you can only buy some cheap vegetables; in the countryside, you can grow your own vegetable garden, which is convenient and affordable to eat vegetables, and you can also participate in labor to earn work points.
    What to Do?
    In the past few years, the state has paid 140 million yuan to build dormitories for Anshan employees. If this money is invested in economic construction, it can build two and a half heavy industry factories like the Anshan Iron and Steel Seamless Steel Tube Plant that are mechanized and automated, or four textile mills with 100,000 spindles. However, according to the current situation, if we want to meet the reasonable and unreasonable needs of all employees, the state will have to pay more construction funds, which will inevitably affect the speed of economic construction.
    How can we not increase the state's excessive burden, but also solve the difficulties for employees who urgently need houses, and allow relatives who are separated in two places to have frequent opportunities to meet? This is a question worth studying. Anshan Iron and Steel, Anshan Metallurgical Construction Corporation, and Anshan Branch of the Geological Bureau have all begun to take some measures that are deeply welcomed by employees.
    (1) Publicize the actual difficulties to the masses and give play to the masses to solve them together. Last year, the Chemical Plant had a total of 584 employees who registered for family dormitories, but the factory only planned to build 60 houses, which was far from meeting the needs of the workers. How to solve it? The factory first drew 11 cadres from various workshops and conducted in-depth investigation and research for 18 days, and determined that there were a total of more than 200 households that urgently needed a solution or needed help to solve the problem in the short term. Based on this survey result, the factory leaders called on all employees to use everyone's strength to solve the difficulties for these comrades. At that time, someone suggested that the Chemical Plant has great potential and many talents, and can collect the waste materials dismantled from the factory buildings and coke ovens in the past and build houses by themselves. Then, all the employees began to collect waste materials in their spare time, and picked up 700,000 bricks and a lot of old wood in 20 days. The factory also drew some technical and transportation forces to support, and the workshops also transferred some workers with carpentry and masonry skills to participate in the construction. Every Sunday, many employees voluntarily went to the construction site to participate in voluntary labor. As a result, a total of only 35,000 yuan was spent to build 204 houses, allowing most of the workers who urgently needed houses to get housing. The Seamless Steel Tube Plant also built more than 30 employee houses last year using the same method.
    (2) Build houses in the form of self-construction and public assistance in factories and mines with conditions. Anshan Iron and Steel Gongchangling Iron Mine had more than 120 workers who built self-built and publicly assisted houses last year and the year before last. These houses were built by agricultural production cooperatives near the mine, and the local favorable conditions were fully utilized when selecting materials. For example, the foundation and walls were built with stone materials on the mountain that did not cost money; the roof frame was made of some wood that could not be used as mine pit pillars or slabs cut from pillars; the cement tiles were processed by the employees themselves in their spare time. In this way, each house with an area of more than 20 square meters only costs 260 to 300 yuan. The construction cost is paid by the public, and the employees who build the houses only need to pay 6 or 7 yuan a month, and they can pay off the entire construction cost in three years; 6 or 7 yuan is only equivalent to 14 or 15 percent of the average salary of underground workers. These houses can generally be lived in for 15 years, and are only a 10-minute walk from the mine. It is very convenient for miners to go to and from work, and for family members to go to the mine to watch dramas and seek medical treatment. There is also open space around, which can be used to grow vegetables and raise chickens, so it is very popular among miners.
    (3) Anshan Iron and Steel and other units set up family hostels last year, specifically to receive employee family members who came to Anshan to visit relatives. In the 92-room hostel of Anshan Iron and Steel, from its establishment in late March to August of last year, it received more than 700 family members who came to visit relatives, including textile female workers who came to see their husbands from Shanghai, Tianjin and other places; female teachers, female students and government cadres who spent their vacations with their lovers; and rural women who came from rural areas in Shandong, Hebei and other places to visit relatives during the slack season. The hostel of Anshan Metallurgical Construction Corporation only had 35 rooms, but it received more than 13,000 family members last year. Such hostels have also been established in geological exploration teams far away in remote mountains.
    However, at present, these hostels have almost all been occupied as family dormitories and can no longer receive family members who come from afar. If the family hostel system can be improved and persisted, and the factory does not use the hostel as a family dormitory, and some employees can overcome personal difficulties and mobilize their lovers who originally came from the countryside to return to the countryside, the family hostel will be a good place for many couples who are separated in two places to reunite.
    (4) Starting this year, the Anshan Branch of the Geological Bureau will implement a half-month vacation system (the itinerary on the way home is calculated as personal leave and is not counted in the vacation) for field workers who cannot return home for a long time. If this vacation system can be extended to some factories and capital construction departments under the conditions that do not affect production and construction, it will enable employees who cannot return home all year round to have the opportunity to return home every year.
    (5) The vast majority of Anshan Iron and Steel employees, whose homes are in Liaoyang, Haicheng, Gaiping and other places near Anshan, can often go home once a week or every other period because of convenient transportation, and many people have homes and businesses in the countryside. If these people do not move their families to the city, it will not only help solve the contradiction of insufficient family dormitories and excessive overcrowding in the city, but also allow family members to participate in agricultural production and increase family income in the countryside. For example, Wang Xiuyu, a 19-year-old elementary school graduate, is from Gaiping and was originally a branch secretary of the Communist Youth League and a production team leader in the agricultural cooperative. Last year, she participated in production in the countryside. In addition to being allocated enough grain and firewood for personal consumption, she also earned more than 100 yuan. However, she left the countryside after getting married. If she can still live in the countryside, she will be an important force in agricultural production, and because of convenient transportation, it takes three hours by train from Anshan to Gaiping, and the couple can also meet once every other period.
    The problem of insufficient dormitories should be solved, but it can only be solved gradually. (Special contribution to this newspaper)

### 宿舍不够能不能很快解决？——鞍山职工住宅情况调查

    宿舍不够能不能很快解决？
    ——鞍山职工住宅情况调查
    新华社驻鞍山记者集体采写
    钢都鞍山在大规模建设初期，职工们就感受到住宅的缺乏。为了解决这个问题，几年来国家付出了巨量的人力和物力，几万职工得到了新住宅。然而，现在住宅供不应求的情况，却使更多的家庭和更多对情人苦恼着。这是什么原因呢？有没有办法在短期内使每一个希望和家人团聚的人得到满足呢？记者为此作了如下的调查：
    住宅的今昔
    到过鞍山的人都有这样的感觉：在鞍山，新建的职工宿舍不是一幢幢的，而是一大片一大片的。沿着十余里路长的胜利路，两旁密密地矗立着簇新的三层和四层的楼房；市区附近的庄稼地上，现在建成了太平村、长甸铺等六、七万人口的工人住宅区。据鞍山市统计局统计，从解放后到1956年，国家已为鞍山的职工建筑了一百六十多万平方公尺的宿舍。居住家属宿舍的职工仅鞍钢和鞍山冶金建筑总公司两个单位，就由1949年的八千一百四十六户增加到现在的五万五千多户。
    这是现在的鞍山。日伪统治时期的鞍山情况可就大不相同了。人们不会忘记，那时供给十三万中国工人住的只有十万平方公尺左右的宿舍面积。那个时候，分配家属宿舍的条件很严格，其中有一条是必须工作三年以上。事实上由于劳动条件恶劣，工作三年以上的工人很少，因而平均每个中国工人还合不到零点八平方公尺；而现在只是解放以后新建的宿舍平均每个职工就合到八平方公尺左右。宿舍的质量也有很大差别，那时的宿舍绝大部分是阴暗、潮湿的简易住宅；而现在一般都是砖木结构的楼房。
    矛盾是怎样产生的？
    解放以来，鞍山的住宅面积虽然年年增加，但是，在住宅问题上，职工和国家企业之间的矛盾并未缓和下来，相反地，是越来越激化了。1954年初，鞍山钢铁公司生产和基本建设部门，有一万五千多人要求分配家属住宅。从那以后到1956年底的三年中，国家共建筑了六十多万平方公尺住宅，按一般标准，足够容纳两万多户职工，但是现在申请家属住宅的人，并未因此减少，反而增加为二万五千多人。住宅越盖越不够。在房屋管理部门，在经理、厂长、党委书记的办公室里，常常聚集着申请家属住宅的人。
    有的职工带着妻子来到领导干部面前拍案大叫。
    有些复员军人说，我为了革命，为了国家，南征北战，出生入死，现在开始和平建设啦，共产党不让我当和尚兵，你们还能叫我当和尚工人吗？给我家属住宅！
    有些有过创造发明或突破定额较多的职工，也摆出自己的功绩向领导人员要房子。
    没有特出表现的职工在向领导上申请房子的时候，也急不可待。他们说，共产党是关心工人疾苦的，你们却不关心我，真是官僚主义！
    家属住宅供不应求的情况是这样的严重，它成了企业内部领导和被领导之间的矛盾之一。这个矛盾的实质，是部分职工的眼前利益和国家的长远利益的矛盾。关于这个矛盾形成的原因，从记者调查的材料中来看是这样的：
    （一）在过去几年中，各生产建设部门都不同程度地过多地增加了职工人数，仅在最近两年中，即大约新增加了三万人左右。去年生产和建设部门共建筑了二十多万平方公尺住宅，按说可以满足新吸收的职工居住。但是，因为他们大部要求家属宿舍，所以仍然很难解决问题。
    要求家属宿舍的人越来越多，是住宅供应紧张的最主要的原因。据鞍钢有关部门调查，1950年分配到家属住宅的职工占全体职工23％。从那时开始到1956年，增加的职工大部分是新工人或没有结婚的青年工人，但是住家属宿舍的职工比例不但未因此相对下降，而且还逐渐增加到34％；相反的，住单身宿舍的职工在这个时期内却由占职工总数22.8％，下降到18％左右。按目前的居住标准，独身宿舍每人一般占三点五居住平方公尺，而家属宿舍每户平均是十四点九居住平方公尺，也就是说，后者比前者要多住三倍多的住宅。
    记者经过多方面调查研究，认为已经分配到或正在申请家属住宅的人许多是合理的，有些是迫切需要的，在有条件的部门，应该尽可能帮助解决。例如年龄较大的转业军人，结婚后长期分居原籍又在远方的夫妇等。但是也有很多数量的职工对家属住宅的客观必要性并不迫切，其中如：有不少年龄刚刚超过二十岁的青年人，就急于结婚，申请家属住宅。例如，正在建设的鞍钢第二中板厂，共有六百多工人。到现在已解决家属住宅的有二百户，大部分是从兄弟厂调来的老工人。目前还在申请家属住宅的有复员军人一百二十四个；老工人三十六个；去年才入厂的新工人七十个。据该厂负责人估计，这二百三十个申请人中，至少有一半可能克服困难自行解决：新工人尚未开始工作，同时入厂时已讲清不能给家属住宅，所以现在不能满足他们的要求；复员军人大部分年龄较大，在可能的条件下，应尽快的帮助他们解决家属住宅问题，但在目前国家资金和建筑材料有限的情况下，他们当中有五十三名原住在鞍山近郊铁路沿线，从厂到家比较方便，不住公家房，也可以常常和家人团聚，另外，还有二十一人现在住在亲戚朋友家中，住宅困难也可以暂时克服。
    据有关部门估计，目前大约有十分之一左右的职工刚刚参加工作，就要把家属接来或建立新家庭，向国家要求分配家属住宅并且条件很高。这就是说，这部分同志还未为国家社会主义工业化贡献力量，就伸手向国家要价值近千元的家属住宅。在鞍钢第二中板厂目前就有二百多人要求家属住宅，其中七十个是新招收的工人。他们在入厂以前要求条件很低，好像只要被吸收入厂就行，但是成了固定工人以后，对家属住宅的要求立即提出来了。新工人刘忠雨本来在鞍山附近有自己的房子，进厂以后就卖掉了，千方百计的向厂方申请家属住宅。领导干部以为他真的困难，就发动许多工人到处给他租房子，结果在海城租到了一间，还附有菜园、家具，每年租金只二十元。但是，他无论如何不要，原因是嫌太远，回家一趟要坐一个钟头的火车，同时他听说今年厂里要盖新房，还是住新房好。以后，这个厂又把这间房子分配给十多个申请户，他们与刘忠雨的想法一样，谁也不要。到现在，这间房子还空着。
    鞍山大约有一半上下的职工是辽阳、海城、盖平等地铁路沿线农村的人，农村姑娘和他们结婚后，就大量迁往城市，有人还未分配到房子，就强行挤入集体宿舍、俱乐部、办公室……表示迫切需要房子，以便逼着领导上尽快给解决。鞍钢二十一宿舍原来是住单身职工的，现在已有五十多个工人将自己的爱人带来住在里边，有的还带来父母兄弟。
    跟丈夫来鞍山的这些妇女大半是新结婚的农村姑娘。他们原来是农业生产合作社社员，有的还是妇女会主任、生产队长、团支部书记等干部。这些人来到鞍山后就成了闲人。第二炼钢厂工人司永安在去年结婚后，不仅带来了二十岁的妻子郭宏俊，还将刚从高小毕业的弟弟司树才也带来鞍山找工作。郭宏俊原来是农业社的优秀社员，又是个中共党员。司树才是二十岁的年轻小伙子，父母都是农民，但他总认为在城市工作比参加农业生产好、挣钱多，半年多来，一直与哥嫂一起住在集体宿舍中，茫无目的地找工作。
    （二）鞍山是一个发展迅速的工业城市。1952年全市人口为三十五万八千人，现在已有七十万人。新增的人口绝大多数是职工及其家属，同时，这些人大都是青壮年，因此鞍山市人口增殖率比全国平均增殖率（2.2％）高出一倍以上。去年，全市出生的婴儿共三万九千个，按七十万人口计算，增殖率为5.57％，据卫生行政部门说：这样高的增殖率在世界上也是少见的。
    随着人口的增加，为他们服务的人——商业工作者、褓姆、职工亲属也随之增加。这些人也需要大量新住宅；同时，许多原来有家属住宅的人，也感到拥挤不够居住了。
     （三）鞍山市内和郊区有很多出租的房屋，现在生产和建设职工大约有两万多户是住在自有房或租入的私人房子里。但是，近几年来他们越来越不甘心住这种房子了，原因是国家新建的住宅，里边生活设备好，离工厂区近，同时经过几次降低房租，现在住公房的职工付出的租金，一般只占他工资收入的2％，有的每户每月只要几角钱就够了。但是住私人房子，付出的租金要高两、三倍，即使住自有房，在付出检修费后，还不如住公家房子便宜。在这种情况下有的职工把自有房出卖了，有的甚至要求把产权交给国家，有些租私人房子的职工，则找出很多借口退租，另外再申请公家的住宅。他们中间有人故意把屋门锁上，把自己的被褥家具扔在门外，然后向领导干部说：“你们看，人家房主把我撵出来了，另给找间房子吧！”
    此外，去年提出对出租房屋进行社会主义改造后，因为政策宣传不够充分及时等原因，许多小房屋出租者产生了顾虑，认为自己也要被改造，房租要降低了，所以就赶把房户（职工）赶走，自己住得宽绰些或者用来养鸡等。这也造成了住宅紧张。
    为城市带来沉重的负担
    大量职工带着家属拥入城市，使她们由劳动者变成单纯消费者，农村失去了劳动力，城市公用事业、食品供应、学校、医院……则承受着巨大的压力。现在，鞍山市郊生产的粮食，仅够市内人口食用二十天，其余都得由关里河北、江苏、湖南、四川等地运来。据粮食部门统计，每吨粮食经过长途搬运和储存过程，要损耗十多斤，国家和消费者都要付出很大费用。
    家庭用煤量也大大增加了。据鞍山市商业局统计，平均每人一年需要七百三十五公斤煤，在去年，国家即动用了七千多个火车皮为1952年后新增的人口运入燃料。
    尽管鞍山市学校数量现在已比解放前发展了十倍左右，但是许多人还不能升学。
    中等学校解放前只有一所，现在是二十所；小学生1956年比1952年增加了三万二千人，其中大部分是职工子弟。在医疗卫生方面，生产和建设部门的职工本来平均一千人有七点九个床位、二点一个医生。但是，由于家属的增加，现在一千个人平均只有两个病床，零点五个医生，医院和门诊部都十分拥挤。
    职工带家属来城市以后，个人生活虽然比较方便了，有的还可以节约开支，但是也有许多人费用增多了，造成经济上拮据。据商业局调查，一个收入较低、生活相当清苦的职工家庭，每人每月主副食费平均得六点二元，其中副食品即占三元，如果在乡下，副食就有可能由她们自己解决。
    化工总厂木工邹广义，一家十一口人，去年家属都在农村，儿子和妻子参加农业劳动，一年做了二千八百个工分，秋后除分得全家食粮外，还收入了八十多元现金，另外，全家还种着菜园，邹广义每天坐通勤车回家，挣的七十四元工资交给父亲支配，供给兄弟、子女和侄儿上学，生活过得还充裕。
    今春，他的妻子和五个孩子迁来鞍山，妻子只能作些家务事，大儿子闲呆了二个多月，最近才当了临时工，家庭经济生活有些吃紧了。他的妻子最近分析住在城市和农村的利弊时说，在城市的好处是不下大力，但动不动就得花钱，吃菜只能买些便宜的；在乡下自己种着菜园，吃菜方便实惠，同时还可以参加劳动挣工分。
    怎么办？
    过去几年中，国家已经支付了一亿四千万元资金为鞍山职工建筑宿舍。如果将这些钱投入经济建设，可以建设两个半像鞍钢无缝钢管厂那样机械化、自动化的重工业工厂，或是四个十万纱锭的纺织厂。但是按照目前的情况，假如要满足全体职工合理的和不合理的需要，那末国家还要付出更多的建设资金，事实上就一定要影响经济建设的速度。
    怎样才能既不增加国家过重的负担，又能使迫切需要房子的职工解决困难，让两地分居的亲人常有见面的机会，这是一个值得研究的问题。鞍钢、鞍山冶金建筑总公司、地质局鞍山分局等都已经开始采取了一些深受职工欢迎的措施。
    （一）将实际困难在群众面前公布，发挥群众来共同解决。去年化工总厂共有五百八十四个职工登记要家属宿舍，但是工厂准备建设的只有六十户，远远不能满足工人需要。怎样解决呢？工厂先从各车间抽调了十一个干部，用十八天的时间进行了深入的调查研究，确定迫切需要解决或是短时期内要帮助解决房子的共有二百多户。根据这个调查结果，工厂领导上就向全体职工号召，用大家的力量来为这些同志解决困难。当时就有人提出化工总厂的潜力很大，人材也很多，可以将过去改建厂房、焦炉时拆除的废料收集起来，自己动手盖房子。接着，全体职工都开始在业余时间收集废材料，二十天内就拣回了七十万块砖和很多旧木料，工厂又抽出一部分技术和运输力量来支援，各车间也调出部分会木工和瓦工技术的工人来参加建筑，每逢星期天，还有许多职工自动到工地上参加义务劳动。结果，总共只花了三万五千多元钱，就建成了二百零四户房子，使大部分迫切需要房子的工人得到了住宅。无缝钢管厂去年也用同样的方法，建筑了三十多户职工住宅。
    （二）在有条件的厂矿企业用自建公助的方式建筑住宅。鞍钢弓长岭铁矿在去年和前年已有一百二十多户工人建设了自建公助的住宅。这些房子是由矿山附近的农业生产合作社建设的，选用材料时充分利用了当地的有利条件。如地基和墙是山上不用花钱的石料建成的；支屋架用的是一部分不能做矿井支柱的木料或是做支柱锯下的板坯；洋灰瓦是职工在业余时间自
  己加工的。这样，每建成面积有二十多平方公尺的一户房子，只要花二百六十到三百多元钱。建筑费由公家代付，盖房子的职工只要每月付六、七元钱，三年就能还清全部建筑费；六、七元钱只相当于井下工人平均工资的十四、五分之一。这些房子一般可以居住十五年，而且离矿山只有十分钟路程，矿工们上下班，家属要到矿山上看戏、求医都很方便。周围还有空地，可以种菜、养鸡，所以很受矿工欢迎。
    （三）鞍钢等单位去年都设立了家属招待所，专门接待来鞍山探望亲人的职工家属。鞍钢的有九十二个房间的招待所里，自去年3月下旬成立到8月的五个月中，接待了七百多个来探望亲人的家属，其中有远从上海、天津等地来看丈夫的纺织女工；也有与爱人共度假期的女教师、女学生和机关干部；还有乘农闲时从山东、河北等地的农村来探望亲人的农村妇女。鞍山冶金建筑总公司的招待所一共只有三十五个房间，但去年就接待了一万三千多个家属。远在荒山僻壤的地质勘探队里，这种招待所也成立了。
    但是，目前这些招待所几乎已全部被占为家属宿舍，不能再招待远道来的家属了。如果能将家属招待所的制度健全起来，坚持下去，工厂不要将招待所作为家属宿舍来利用，一些职工能克服个人困难，将原来从农村来的爱人动员回农村去，家属招待所将是很多两地分居的夫妻很好的团聚之处。
    （四）地质局鞍山分局从今年开始，将对长期不能回家的野外工作人员，实行每年半个月的休假期制（回家路上的日程按事假计算，不算在假期内）。如果能将这种休假制在不影响生产、建设的条件下，推广到有些工厂和基本建设部门，就能使长年不能回家的职工每年都有回家的机会。
    （五）占鞍钢职工绝大多数的、家住在鞍山附近的辽阳、海城、盖平等地的职工，因为交通方便，往往每周或每隔一个时期都能回家一次，还有很多人在农村是有家有业的。如果这些人不把家搬到城市里来，不仅有助于解决家属宿舍不足和城市过分拥挤的矛盾，而且家属在农村还能参加农业生产、增加家庭的收入。如十九岁的高小毕业生王秀玉是盖平人，原是农业社里的团支部书记和生产队长。去年她在农村参加生产，除了分到够个人吃、烧的粮食柴草外，还剩余一百多元钱，但结婚后就离开了农村。如果她能仍旧住在农村，将是农业生产中的一分重要力量，而且因为交通方便，从鞍山坐火车三个小时可以到盖平，夫妻之间也可以每隔一个时候见面一次。
    宿舍不够的问题是应该解决的，但是只能逐步地解决。　（本报专稿）
