Xinhua News Agency, Prague, May 29th: The Czechoslovak News Agency began broadcasting statements on May 28th from world-renowned scientists on the dangers of atomic bomb tests to humanity.

The Czechoslovak News Agency's reporters posed several questions to a number of world-renowned scientists, requesting their answers. These questions included: If radioactive fallout continues to increase, will it pose a threat to humanity? When and in what parts of the human body will the consequences of this exposure manifest? And are there any safe places in the world? What measures will scientists recommend to prevent this atomic danger that threatens humanity?

According to the news agency, Professor Nishiwaki Yasushi of Japan stated in his reply that nuclear weapons tests should be stopped. He believes that the increase in Strontium-90 particles will increase the potential danger to humanity. He said: "One of the noteworthy characteristics of radioactive hazards is that there is a long latent period. Sometimes this latent period lasts for several months, sometimes for more than twenty years. Especially when it comes to the genetic consequences of radioactivity, we must wait at least several generations to see the consequences. By the time those genetic consequences become apparent, it will be too late to make any amends. Therefore, we must stop nuclear bomb tests before those consequences manifest themselves."

Academician Nesmeyanov, President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, said in his reply to the Czechoslovak News Agency: Although research on the consequences of atomic and hydrogen weapon tests is still insufficient, it is now absolutely clear that any war using atomic and hydrogen weapons—and such bombs are now being tested for the purpose of waging war—carries the danger of exterminating hundreds of millions of people, destroying entire countries, and destroying the great and irreplaceable achievements of science and culture.

Nesmeyanov said that due to the increasing number of atomic and hydrogen bomb tests, we are now noticing an increasing number of long-latent radioactive isotopes, especially Strontium-90 and Cesium-137, in the atmosphere and on the ground. He said that particularly dangerous is the radioactive fallout of Strontium-90 particles, which will contaminate the ground, individual parts of the ocean, seep into the organisms living there, and poison them. He also emphasized the need to mention that no part of the world can avoid radioactive particles, because the air currents in the stratosphere and the ocean currents circulate around the entire globe. Indeed, in order to protect their countries from radioactivity, the US and British governments are conducting their atomic and hydrogen bomb tests far away from their territories, mainly in the Pacific region. Of course, this will cause a large amount of radioactive particles to fall on the territories of Pacific countries (Japan, Australia, New Zealand, etc.).

He mentioned the appeal made by the Supreme Soviet to the US and British parliaments, advocating the immediate cessation of atomic and hydrogen weapon tests, and expressed his conviction that the people of all countries welcome the complete elimination of such weapons.

Professor Heisenberg of the Federal Republic of Germany spoke in his reply about the specific problem of radioactive substances in the air. He said that according to the biological research he has conducted, there has not been, at any time, an immediate and widespread danger of radioactive substances in the air caused by atomic tests. However, he also said: "If military-technical experiments continue, they can, in due course, cause the kind of serious danger mentioned in Albert Schweitzer's appeal."

### 各国科学家发表谈话  原子弹试验对人类危害很大

    各国科学家发表谈话
    原子弹试验对人类危害很大
    据新华社布拉格29日电　捷克斯洛伐克通讯社28日开始陆续广播世界著名的科学家们就原子弹试验对于人类危害问题发表的谈话。
    捷克斯洛伐克通讯社的记者向一些世界著名的科学家提出了一些问题，请求答复。这些问题包括：如果放射性灰尘继续增加的话，对人类是不是一种威胁？在人体组织上造成的后果会在什么时候和什么部分显露出来？以及世界上是不是有安全的地方？科学家们将建议采取何种措施来防止这种威胁着人类的原子危险？
    据这家通讯社报道，日本西胁康教授在答复中主张应该停止核武器试验。他认为，锶——90微粒的增多将增加对人类的潜在的危险。他说：“放射性危害的值得注意的特点之一是有一个长期的潜伏时期。有时这种潜伏时期达几个月，有时达二十年以上。特别是当牵涉到放射性的遗传后果时，我们必须至少等待好几代才能看到后果。到遗传上的那些后果变得明显的时候，作任何补救都太迟了。因此，我们必须在那些后果表现出来以前就停止核弹试验。”
    苏联科学院院长涅斯米扬诺夫院士在致捷克斯洛伐克通讯社的答复中说：虽然关于原子和氢武器试验的后果的研究还不充分，但是现在已经绝对清楚：即任何使用原子和氢武器——而且现在正在为了进行战争而试验这种炸弹——的战争都有消灭千百万人、毁灭整个国家以及毁灭科学和文化的巨大而无可替代的成就的危险。
    涅斯米扬诺夫说，由于原子核和氢弹的试验日益增多，我们现在注意到大气中和地面上已有数量愈来愈多的长的潜伏时期的放射性同位素，尤其是锶—90和铯—137。他说，特别危险的是落下来的锶—90的放射性微粒沉渣，这种沉渣会沾染地面、海洋的个别部分，渗入生活在那里的有机体并且毒害它们。他还强调有必要提到世界没有任何部分能避免放射性微粒这件事，因为同温层中的气流和海洋中的潮流是环绕整个地球流动的。真的，美国和英国政府为了保护它们国家不受放射性的影响，它们的原子弹和氢弹试验是在远离它们的领土的地方，主要是在太平洋地区进行的。当然，这就会引起大量放射性微粒落在太平洋国家的领土上（日本、澳大利亚、新西兰等国）。
    他提到最高苏维埃通过的对美英议会的呼吁，主张立即停止原子武器和氢武器试验，并表示确信各国人民欢迎完全取消这类武器。
    德意志联邦共和国海森贝格教授在他的答复中谈到空气中的放射性物质的特殊问题。他说，根据他所进行的生物学研究，迄今还没有在任何时候存在着因为原子试验而引起的空气中放射性物质的立即和普遍的危险，但是，他又说：“军事技术试验如果继续下去是能够在相当时候引起像艾伯特·施维泽尔的呼吁中所说的那种严重的危险的。”
