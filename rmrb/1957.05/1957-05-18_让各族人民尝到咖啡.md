Let People of All Ethnic Groups Taste Coffee

    (Our newspaper reports) A number of agricultural production cooperatives in Baise County, Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture, Guangxi Province, are actively trying to grow coffee trees.

    Last year, after the state-owned coffee farm established in Yangxu County successfully cultivated coffee trees on a trial basis, this year, in addition to the farm's plan to plant more than 6,000 mu on the mountains, the county leadership also mobilized some agricultural cooperatives to conduct trial planting. Now, sixteen agricultural cooperatives have planted more than 2,600 trees. The cooperative members are very enthusiastic about planting coffee trees. They say: If we succeed in our trial planting this year, we can plant them on a large scale next year, so that people of all ethnic groups in our motherland can taste delicious coffee.

    让各族人民尝到咖啡
    本报讯　广西省桂西僮族自治州百色县的部分农业生产合作社，正在积极试种咖啡树。
    去年，这个县在阳圩设立的国营咖啡农场试种咖啡树成功后，今年除农场计划上山定植六千多亩外，县领导机关还发动部分农业社进行试种。现在已有十六个农业社种植了二千六百多棵。社员们对种植咖啡树的积极性很高，他们说：我们今年试种成功后，明年就可以大量种植，让祖国的各族人民都能尝到美味的咖啡。（萧强）
