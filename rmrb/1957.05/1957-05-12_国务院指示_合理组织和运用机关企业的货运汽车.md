State Council Directive
Rational Organization and Utilization of Motor Transport Vehicles of Government Organizations and Enterprises

With the continuous growth of the national economy, highway transportation volume is also increasing rapidly. All regions feel the shortage of automobiles, especially in the Northwest and Southwest provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, where highway transportation is even more strained. In some areas, it has already affected industrial and agricultural production, basic construction projects, and people's livelihoods. Under the current circumstances where the state cannot significantly increase the number of automobiles, in addition to the need to fully utilize and appropriately develop private transportation tools, it is essential to fully utilize the potential of existing transportation vehicles of government organizations and enterprises to alleviate the tense transportation situation. The number of self-owned freight vehicles of existing government organizations and enterprises is almost close to the number of public operating vehicles nationwide, and most of them are new vehicles, which contain great transportation potential. In the past, various units have used these vehicles to complete many major transportation tasks, but due to the fact that the transportation tasks of government organizations and enterprises are often uneven and abnormal, with great limitations and seasonality, and the general management conditions are also poor, the transportation efficiency is low and the transportation capacity is greatly wasted. Therefore, all regions should strengthen the management of freight vehicles of government organizations and enterprises, implement unified planned transportation, and plan to regulate the imbalance of transportation volume between departments and peak and off-seasons, organize return freight and cyclical transportation, to fully utilize their transportation potential. This is an effective measure to implement the spirit of building the country with diligence and thrift, and to implement increased production and conservation to alleviate the tense situation of highway transportation.

(1) The People's Committees of all provinces (municipalities, autonomous regions) should instruct the departments in charge of transportation to be responsible for the comprehensive organization of planned transportation, and to prescribe reasonable production targets for the freight vehicles of government organizations and enterprises (including administrative management organs at all levels, public institutions, cooperatives, organizations, schools, and state-owned, local state-owned, and joint state-private industrial and commercial enterprises, etc.). Government organizations and enterprises should regularly submit the balance plan of their own transportation capacity and transportation volume. In addition to prioritizing the transportation of goods of their own departments, the surplus transportation capacity of self-provided automobiles should be adjusted and arranged by the local transportation department.

In order to adapt to the production and business needs of vehicle-owning units, the production targets for freight vehicles of government organizations and enterprises should not be set too high in the initial stage; it is also appropriate to stipulate the allowable range for changing plans; vehicles for internal transportation in factories and mines, some vehicles undertaking special transportation tasks (such as vehicles required by survey teams, etc.) and special vehicles (such as tankers, refrigerated vehicles, etc.), and other vehicles that are not suitable for participating in unified planned transportation for the time being, may be allowed not to participate or not to participate in unified planned transportation for a certain period of time.

The freight charges obtained by the freight vehicles of government organizations and enterprises for transporting goods allocated by the transportation department shall belong to the vehicle-owning government organizations and enterprises. The transportation department is responsible for handling the various business procedures that should be handled, and the transportation department may charge a reasonable handling fee.

Freight vehicles of government organizations and enterprises participating in planned transportation can adjust the area of use (such as transferring from place A to place B) on their own due to the business needs of their own departments. However, the local transportation authorities should be notified before the transfer in order to adjust the transportation capacity plan. When the transportation capacity of government organizations and enterprises with vehicles is insufficient, the local transportation departments should, under the unified arrangement of the local government, assist in solving the problem as much as possible.

(2) When uniformly balancing planned transportation, attention should be paid to implementing the principle of fully utilizing private transportation tools and rationally using automobiles. For some self-transported goods of government organizations and enterprises, if it is more economical and reasonable to transport them by animal-drawn carts or human-powered carts rather than by automobiles (such as when the transportation distance is too short), the transportation department should, through consultation, transfer the necessary animal-drawn carts or human-powered carts to carry them, and extract the automobiles to undertake the transportation tasks with longer distances and which must be completed by automobiles.

(3) The implementation of planned transportation may not be very thorough in the initial stage. In order to reduce the empty driving of automobiles as much as possible, all empty freight vehicles should actively contact the nearby state-owned transportation department for loading. Highway transportation departments along the way should also actively organize return vehicles to transport goods according to transportation needs. However, when distributing goods, the convenience of return vehicles should be fully considered, and efforts should be made to simplify procedures.

(4) If government organizations and enterprises with vehicles have difficulties in managing vehicles, the transportation department can accept the entrustment, sign a contract, and manage the vehicles on their behalf, and organize a motorcade to operate independently. In addition to prioritizing the transportation tasks of the original unit, the surplus transportation capacity of the vehicles managed on behalf of the transportation department shall be organized for full use, and the ownership of the vehicles shall remain with the original unit. However, the transportation department can also accept it if there is a willingness to hand over the vehicle rights.

(5) In the process of establishing and promoting the above-mentioned systems, local transportation departments and vehicle-owning government organizations and enterprises should fully cooperate and support each other. It is necessary to prevent management from being too strict and rigid, and also to prevent the bias of excessively emphasizing the convenience of use by the unit. Government organizations and enterprises should gradually establish an economic accounting system for self-owned freight vehicles, improve operation and management, improve transportation efficiency, and reduce transportation costs. The transportation department should provide regular technical and business guidance and assistance.

(6) All regions should stipulate a system for regularly inspecting the use of freight vehicles of government organizations and enterprises. Units that can regularly complete the transportation plan and various production targets should be commended.

(7) After the self-owned freight vehicles of government organizations and enterprises participate in the unified planned transportation, the additional fuel consumed due to the transportation tasks allocated by the transportation department should first be adjusted and resolved by the unit itself under the locally prescribed consumption quota for saving fuel. If there is indeed a shortage, the transportation department should provide a certificate of application for the additional amount of oil consumed to purchase it from the oil company at a price.

(8) When the automobile repair capacity of government organizations and enterprises is surplus, it can also be uniformly organized, adjusted and utilized.

The People's Committees of all provinces (municipalities, autonomous regions) should formulate specific implementation methods in accordance with the above-mentioned principles, adapt to local conditions, and implement them.

    国务院指示
    合理组织和运用机关企业的货运汽车
    随着国民经济的不断增长，公路运输量也增加很快，各地均感到汽车不足，尤其是西北、西南各省、市、区的公路运输更是紧张，有些地区已经影响到工农业生产、基本建设工程和人民的生活。在目前国家不可能大量增添汽车的情况下，除了必须充分利用和适当发展民间运输工具以外，十分需要充分发挥机关、企业现有运输车辆的潜力，以缓和运输的紧张状况。现有机关、企业的自用货运汽车的数量，几乎已经接近于全国公用营运汽车的数量，而且大多数是新车，其中蕴藏着很大的运输潜力。过去各单位运用这些车辆完成了许多重大的运输任务，但限于机关、企业运输任务往往不能均衡和正常，带有很大的局限性和季节性，一般管理条件也差些，以致运输效率低，运力浪费大。因此，各地应该对机关、企业的货运汽车加强管理，实行统一的计划运输，有计划地调剂部门间和淡旺季运量的不均衡，组织回程货载和循环运输，以充分发挥其运输潜力。这是本着勤俭建国的精神，贯彻增产节约与缓和公路运输紧张状况的有效措施。
    （一）各省（市、自治区）人民委员会应该责成主管交通运输部门负责全面地组织计划运输，并且对机关、企业（包括各级行政管理机关、事业机关、合作社、团体、学校及国营、地方国营、公私合营工商企业等）的货运汽车规定合理的生产指标。机关、企业应该定期报送本单位运力和运量的平衡计划，自备汽车除了优先运送本部门的货物以外，多余的运力应该由当地交通运输部门调剂安排任务。
    为着适应车属单位的生产和业务需要，对机关、企业货运汽车的生产指标，初期不宜规定过高；还可适当地规定允许变更计划的幅度；对工厂、矿山内部运输车辆、部分担任特殊运输任务的车辆（如勘测队所需车辆等）和特种车辆（如油车、冷藏车等），以及其他一时不宜参加统一计划运输的车辆，可允许其不参加或在一定时期内不参加统一计划运输。
    机关、企业货运汽车运送交通运输部门分配的货物，所得运费归车属机关、企业。应办的各项业务手续由运输部门负责办理，运输部门可酌收合理的手续费。
    参加计划运输的机关、企业货运汽车，如因本部门业务需要，可以自行调剂使用地区（如由甲地调拨乙地）。但调动前应通知当地交通主管部门，以便调整运力计划。有车的机关、企业运力不足的时候，各地交通运输部门应该在当地统一安排下，尽量协助解决。
    （二）在统一平衡计划运输的时候，应该注意贯彻充分地利用民间运输工具和合理地使用汽车的原则。对有些机关、企业的自运货物，用汽车运输反不如用兽力车或人力车运输较为经济合理的（如运距过短时），应该通过协商，由交通运输部门调给必要的兽力车或人力车承运，将汽车抽出担任运距较长和必需汽车完成的运输任务。
    （三）初期实行计划运输还不可能很周密，为了尽可能减少汽车空驶，所有空驶货运汽车都应该主动地向就近国营运输部门联系配载。沿途公路运输部门根据运输需要也应积极组织回空汽车运货。但是在配货的时候，要充分考虑回空汽车的便利，并且力求手续简化。
    （四）如有车的机关、企业管理车辆有困难，交通运输部门可以接受委托，签订合同，代为管理车辆，单独组织车队营运。代管车辆除了优先担任原单位的运输任务以外，其多余运力由交通运输部门组织充分使用，车辆产权仍归原单位所有。但是如有愿意将车权交出的，运输部门也可以接收。
    （五）在建立和推行上述各项制度过程中，各地交通运输部门和有车的机关、企业应该充分协作，互相支援。既要防止管理得过严过死，又要防止过于强调本单位使用方便的偏向。机关、企业对自用货运汽车应该逐步建立经济核算制度，改善经营管理，提高运输效率，降低运输成本。交通运输部门应在技术、业务方面给予经常的指导和帮助。
    （六）各地对机关、企业货运汽车的运用情况应该规定按期检查的制度。对经常能够按期完成运输计划和各项生产指标的单位应该加以表扬。
    （七）机关、企业自用货运汽车参加统一计划运输后，由于运送由运输部门分配的运输任务而多耗用的油料，首先应该在当地规定的节约用油的消耗定额下自行调剂解决，确实还有不足的时候，再由运输部门给予多耗油量的申请证明向石油公司价购。
    （八）机关、企业的汽车修理能力有多余的时候，亦可以统一组织，调剂运用。
    各省（市、自治区）人民委员会应根据上述各项原则，因地制宜地制定具体实施办法，贯彻执行。
