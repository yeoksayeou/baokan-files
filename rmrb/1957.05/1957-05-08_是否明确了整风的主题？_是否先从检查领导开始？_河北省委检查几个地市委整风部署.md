    Baoding, May 7th (People's Daily) – After the Hebei Provincial Party Committee and directly subordinate organizations launched the rectification movement, the Baoding, Zhangjiakou, Tangshan, and Baoding Municipal Party Committees also deployed the rectification movement successively on May 4th and 5th. To ensure the healthy development of the movement, Zhang Chengxian, Secretary of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee Secretariat, and Zhai Xiangdong, head of the Rural Group of the Provincial Party Committee's Rectification Office, inspected the rectification deployments of the Baoding Municipal Party Committee, Baoding Prefectural Party Committee, and others. They found that some leading comrades of the prefectural (municipal) Party Committees were not very clear about the theme and purpose of this rectification movement. Some believed that this rectification was no different from previous rectifications, and thus mechanically applied the experience of the past "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, setting the steps of the rectification movement as studying documents, individual self-reflection, and group approval. They also simply understood the principle of "both rectification and work must not be neglected" as rectifying style while not delaying daily work, neglecting the importance of better handling contradictions among the people through rectification and study. Some leading comrades only focused on how to motivate general party members and cadres, neglecting to take the lead in studying and examining themselves.
    In response to the above situation, the Hebei Provincial Party Committee, based on the specific conditions of Hebei Province, proposed to highlight the resolution of eight specific issues in the rectification, including the grain supply problem, the upcoming summer collection and purchase and advance distribution problem, and water conservancy disputes between regions. It also pointed out that leading organs at all levels must effectively grasp the theme of the rectification, clarifying that the purpose of this rectification is to overcome the bureaucratic, sectarian, and subjectivist work styles that affect the correct resolution of contradictions among the people, to correctly handle contradictions among the people, and to closely integrate the rectification movement with the current handling of contradictions among the people, preventing deviation from the theme and generally conducting superficial inspections. Leading comrades at all levels must start with themselves, overcoming the tendency to only lead others in studying and inspecting others' problems, while neglecting to first improve their own understanding and improve their work style.

    是否明确了整风的主题？
    是否先从检查领导开始？
    河北省委检查几个地市委整风部署
    本报保定7日电　中共河北省委及省直属机关党组织的整风运动开展以后，中共保定、张家口、唐山地委和保定市委于5月4日和5日也先后部署开展整风运动。为保证运动的健康发展，中共河北省委书记处书记张承先和省委整风办公室农村组长翟向东对保定市委和保定地委等的整风部署进行了检查，发现有些地（市）委的领导同志对这次整风运动的主题和目的还不很明确，有的认为这次整风和以往的整风没有什么不同，因而机械地搬用过去“三反”、“五反”运动时的经验，把整风运动的步骤定为学习文件、个人反省、小组通过；对整风和工作两不误，也简单地理解为既整了风、又不耽误日常工作，忽视了通过整风学习更好地处理人民内部矛盾。有的领导同志只偏重于考虑怎样推动一般党员干部，忽略了自己带头学习检查。
    针对以上情况，中共河北省委根据河北省的具体情况，提出在整风中要突出的解决粮食供应问题、即将到来的夏季征收统购和预分问题、地区之间的水利纠纷等八个具体问题；并指出各级领导机关要切实把握住整风的主题，明确这次整风的目的是克服影响正确解决人民内部矛盾的官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义作风，达到正确地处理人民内部的矛盾，同时要把整风运动同当前处理人民内部矛盾紧密结合起来，防止离开主题，一般地进行泛泛检查的作法。各级领导同志要先从本身作起，克服只是领导别人学习，检查别人的问题，而忽略首先是自己要提高认识，改进作风。
