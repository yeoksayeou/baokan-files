The West Plots to Divide Four Arab Nations Under the Guise of "Anti-Communism"

    This newspaper reports Western news agencies are revealing that, under the planning of Western countries, an anti-communist alliance including Jordan, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia is being brewed. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Baghdad: A plan that may lead to an East Arab anti-communist alliance and isolate Egypt and Syria is taking shape. Jordan's King Hussein and Iraq's King Faisal exchange messages almost daily. Hussein also maintains close contact with the King of Saudi Arabia. Iraqi sources believe that the purpose of the close exchanges between the three countries is to "point the way to Syria, and if Syria follows, then these four countries can form a deterrent force" to isolate Egypt.

    Another Agence France-Presse dispatch from Beirut: Arab figures in Beirut expect that Saudi Arabian King Saud will visit Baghdad on May 11 with the aim of reaching a reconciliation with Iraq. Prior to this, Jordan's King's uncle, Jemal, went to Baghdad at the end of April to hold talks with Iraqi King Faisal and Prime Minister Said. According to informed sources, Jemal's mission was to make arrangements for talks between Saud, Faisal, and Hussein.

    The report said that the three kings are expected to hold talks subsequently to strengthen ties and unify policies among the three countries.

    Agence France-Presse said: The Jordanian and Iraqi royal families both belong to the Hashemite dynasty, and they have traditional animosity toward the Saudi dynasty. If the reconciliation of the three countries continues, "this may be a sign of the Middle East kingdoms forming a holy alliance to guarantee order. Whether this alliance can eliminate the revolutionary sentiments among the Arab masses remains to be seen."

    Agence France-Presse quoted Beirut's "Daily News" as saying that Lebanese President Chamoun intends to suggest holding a summit of the heads of state of Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Jordan, and Lebanon to discuss the establishment of a Beirut-Baghdad-Amman-Riyadh "axis" and jointly accept US "aid" and unify the "anti-communist" struggle.

    西方在“反共”的幌子下
    策划分化阿拉伯四国
    本报讯　西方通讯社纷纷透露，在西方国家的策划下，一个包括约旦、伊拉克和沙特阿拉伯的反共联盟正在酝酿中。据美联社巴格达消息：一个可能导致东阿拉伯反共联盟而孤立埃及和叙利亚的计划正在形成中。约旦国王侯赛因和伊拉克国王费萨尔差不多每天都有讯息往来。侯赛因也同沙特阿拉伯国王保持密切联系。伊拉克人士认为，三国密切往来的目的是“向叙利亚指明道路，如果叙利亚跟着走的话，那么这四个国家就可形成一个威慑力量”，以孤立埃及。
    另据法新社贝鲁特消息：贝鲁特的阿拉伯人士预料，沙特阿拉伯国王沙特将在5月11日访问巴格达，目的是要同伊拉克取得和解。在这以前，约旦国王的叔父杰迈勒曾在4月底前往巴格达与伊拉克国王费萨尔和首相赛义德进行会谈。据消息灵通人士说，杰迈勒出使的目的是要为沙特、费萨尔和侯赛因的会谈做好安排。
    报道说，预料三国国王将随后举行会谈，以密切三国联系和统一三国政策。
    法新社说：约旦和伊拉克王室都是属于哈希姆王朝的，它们和沙特王朝有着传统的敌对情绪。如果三国和解继续下去，“这也许是中东王国缔结一种神圣同盟以保障秩序的迹象。这个同盟是否能够消除阿拉伯群众中的革命情绪，那还要到将来再看”。
    法新社引用贝鲁特“日报”的消息说：黎巴嫩总统夏蒙打算建议举行沙特阿拉伯、伊拉克、约旦和黎巴嫩四国元首会议，讨论建立贝鲁特—巴格达—安曼—利雅得“轴心”问题，并共同接受美国“援助”和统一“反共”斗争。
