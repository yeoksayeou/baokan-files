An Important Plot by the US-West German Axis
By Our Commentator

After Adenauer's five-day visit to the United States, a joint communiqué was issued with Eisenhower on the 28th. This communiqué grandly discussed many issues related to European security and world peace, but it did not make any truly valuable contributions to these issues.

However, Eisenhower and Adenauer's talks showed great interest in deepening the division of Germany and creating tension in Europe. In their joint communiqué, both sides announced that they would further strengthen the North Atlantic aggressive organization; West Germany would establish an army as soon as possible; and the United States would continue to station troops in Europe and West Germany. They also advocated that the North Atlantic Treaty forces should use "all available means," including the so-called "provision and use of the most modern defensive weapons." West Germany's Free Democratic Party newspaper "Correspondence News" aptly compared this joint communiqué to an "army communiqué on the Cold War."

When discussing the disarmament issue, which is being closely watched by the whole world, the joint communiqué emphasized that before a comprehensive disarmament agreement is reached, "the issue of restoring German reunification must be resolved as a prerequisite." The US President also assured Adenauer that the United States would never take any action in disarmament that would harm Adenauer's policy of a unified Germany.

The attitude of the United States and West German governments in linking disarmament and the German issue in this way obviously has two effects. On the one hand, in the face of the rising tide of world people demanding disarmament, especially after the Soviet government has made many constructive efforts, it is already very difficult to drag on the disarmament negotiations without any results. The United States now has to consider making some concessions to cope with world opinion, and Adenauer also needs a little easing of the atmosphere and to flaunt certain hopes to the West German people in solving the German issue, in order to help him in his election campaign. Therefore, the communiqué expressed support for "making a start" in disarmament, and even indicated that it would be an appropriate time to hold a four-power foreign ministers' conference to discuss the German issue. However, on the other hand, any gap opened in the disarmament stalemate will inevitably greatly encourage the world's people to further demand comprehensive disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons, and the movement to ease international tensions. This is of course something that the United States and West German governments do not want to see. Therefore, they set up obstacles in advance in this regard. This obstacle is the issue of German reunification. They regard the solution of the German reunification issue as a prerequisite for reaching a comprehensive disarmament agreement, and at the same time regard Adenauer's so-called "free elections" as a necessary method for German reunification. They know that the German Democratic Republic and the Soviet Union can never agree to use this method to incorporate Eastern Germany into Adenauer's Germany, so such an arrangement will make the German issue unsolvable, thereby hindering comprehensive disarmament.

A major content of the joint communiqué is to try to show that the United States guarantees not to change its policy towards Germany, and it firmly supports the Adenauer government and its policy of "unifying Germany." This American support is what Adenauer sought in his visit to the United States this time. He hopes to rely on this support to strengthen his position in this year's election.

It can be seen that Eisenhower really took great pains to add some capital to Adenauer's election campaign in West Germany. In addition to the aforementioned guarantees and promises, the US government also expressed its support for West Germany's efforts to participate in organizing the European Common Market and the Atomic Energy Community. The US government knows that if Adenauer is finally ousted in the September elections this year, then the European policy that the US government is trying to strengthen, based on the US-West German axis, will encounter major difficulties.

    美国—西德轴心的一次重要策划
    本报评论员
    阿登纳到美国访问了五天之后，在28日和艾森豪威尔发表了会谈公报。这个公报冠冕堂皇地谈到了不少同欧洲安全和世界和平有关的问题，但是却没有在这些问题上作出真正有价值的贡献。
    但是，艾森豪威尔和阿登纳的会谈对于加深德国分裂和制造欧洲紧张局势，却表示了巨大的兴趣。在他们的会谈公报中，双方宣布：要进一步加强北大西洋侵略组织；西德将尽快建立军队；美国将继续在欧洲和西德驻军。他们还鼓吹北大西洋公约军队要使用“一切可以利用的手段”，包括所谓“最现代化的防御武器的提供使用”。西德的自由民主党报纸“通信报”恰当地把这个会谈公报比作一个“关于冷战的陆军公报”。
    会谈公报在谈到全世界都在密切注视的裁军问题时强调说，在达成全面裁军协议之前，“一定要以事先解决德国恢复统一问题为先决条件”。美国总统还向阿登纳保证，美国在裁军方面将决不采取有损阿登纳的统一德国政策的行动。
    美国和西德政府把裁军和德国问题这样连在一起的态度，显然有两种作用。一方面，在目前世界人民要求裁减军备的高涨的浪潮面前，特别当苏联政府作了许多建设性的努力之后，再要使裁军谈判毫无结果地拖延下去已经是非常困难了。美国现在不得不考虑做出一些让步的姿态来应付世界舆论，而阿登纳也需要有一点缓和的空气并在解决德国问题方面向西德人民炫耀某些希望，这样来帮助他竞选，所以公报中表示赞成在裁军方面“作出开端”，甚至表示那时将是举行一个四国外长会议来讨论德国问题的适当时机。但是，另一方面，在裁军僵局上打开的任何一点缺口，势必会大大鼓励世界人民进一步要求全面裁军和禁止原子武器、缓和国际紧张局势的运动。这当然是美国和西德政府所不愿意看到的。因此他们就预先在这方面设下障碍。这个障碍就是德国重新统一问题。他们把德国统一问题的解决作为达成全面裁军协议的先决条件，同时又把阿登纳主张的所谓“自由选举”作为德国统一所必需采取的方法。他们知道德意志民主共和国和苏联都决不可能同意用这种方法把东部德国并入阿登纳德国，所以这样的安排就会使德国问题无法解决，从而也阻挠了全面的裁军。
    会谈公报的一个主要内容是力图表明，美国保证不改变对德国的政策，它坚决支持阿登纳政府和它的“统一德国”的政策。美国的这种支持，就是阿登纳这次访美所要寻求的东西。他希望靠这种支持来加强他在今年竞选中的地位。
    可以看出，这次艾森豪威尔的确是煞费苦心地想为阿登纳在西德的竞选中增添一些可以吹嘘的资本。除了前面所说的保证和诺言，美国政府还表示支持西德参加组织欧洲共同市场和原子联营的努力。美国政府知道，如果阿登纳在今年9月的选举中终于被赶下台去，那末，美国政府正在力图加强的、以美国—西德轴心为基础的欧洲政策将遇到重大的困难。
