Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, May 1st. (Xinhua News Agency reporter Hu Chengqing, Feng Daisong reports): The leading organs of Hebei Province have begun to comprehensively address the problems existing in the current market.

There are some noteworthy situations that have emerged in the Hebei market recently. These are: the materials traded in the free market exceed the prescribed scope; some materials subject to state monopoly purchase and marketing, and materials entrusted to state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce for unified purchase, have also flowed into the free market. In some areas, the grain transported by farmers and small vendors accounts for 20% to 30% of the grain market trading volume, and the price is much higher than the state-stipulated price. Even grain coupons have become objects of speculation. Regarding materials subject to state unified purchase, some agricultural cooperatives and farmers do not fulfill the pre-purchase or ordering contracts with the state, but instead sell them on the free market at prices 50% to 100% higher than the state price. Many units are buying at high prices on the market, which further encourages this incorrect practice by farmers. Due to the lack of active leadership and management, the prices of some materials in the free market, such as vegetables and fresh eggs, have increased significantly. State-owned companies and supply and marketing cooperatives should be operating these materials, but some places have not been actively operating them. Many peddlers engage in speculation and profiteering in the market, deceiving customers and seeking exorbitant profits.

On the other hand, many units in industry, handicrafts, and other departments are competing for raw materials in the market at high prices. Some units even purchase large quantities of materials they do not need, hoarding them for exchange with other units.

The prices of some industrial products and many handicrafts have increased. Some of these increases are justified, but some are due to unreasonable price increases caused by buying raw materials at high prices or pursuing profits.

The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Hebei Provincial People's Committee have recently seriously studied these situations and believe that the causes of the above-mentioned chaotic situation are mainly that the supply of many materials is insufficient this year, and that Hebei Province suffered a severe flood last year, resulting in reduced production of major agricultural products such as grain, cotton, and oilseeds, which has made the supply and demand relationship of certain major materials even more strained.

The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Hebei Provincial People's Committee have decided to comprehensively launch a campaign to increase production and practice economy, and, in accordance with the spirit of overall planning and reasonable arrangement, to uniformly balance the distribution of materials and ease the contradiction of current material shortages. At the same time, they will extensively carry out propaganda and education, improve economic work and administrative management, and strengthen organizational leadership to overcome the above-mentioned chaotic market phenomena.

The Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee have decided to conduct a propaganda and education campaign in May among Communist Party members, state cadres, and the broad masses to make them understand the current market chaos, guide them to criticize capitalist tendencies and various incorrect views and practices, so that cadres can master the correct methods for handling market problems and the masses can consciously abide by state policies and laws.

In terms of implementing policies, the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee have decided to strictly manage state monopoly purchase and marketing materials such as grain, cotton, and oilseeds, and prohibit vendors from transporting and trading them. Farmers are allowed to exchange varieties, exchange goods, or sell processed and reproduced products after completing their sales tasks to the state, but they are not allowed to use food rations or seeds. For materials subject to state unified purchase, agricultural cooperatives and farmers must first fulfill the pre-purchase and ordering contracts they have signed with the state. After completing their sales tasks to the state, the remaining portion is allowed to be self-produced and self-sold in the local market, and transportation and operation are prohibited. For materials open to the free market, such as chickens, ducks, fish, eggs, vegetables, and small local by-products, agricultural cooperatives and farmers are allowed to produce and sell them themselves and buy them for their own use, and vendors are allowed to transport and operate them. In order to control the source of goods and stabilize the market, state-owned and cooperative commerce must also actively expand operations and overcome bureaucratic and rigid operating methods, and learn how to do business.

Farmers' trade must be restricted to the scope prescribed by the state. The transportation and marketing activities of agricultural cooperatives and farmers in general areas should be resolutely stopped, and the shops they have opened should be closed within a time limit. Farmers in disaster areas who operate open materials should also gradually stop their operating activities based on their specific production and living conditions.

Market prices should be managed differently for different materials. The mutual exchange of materials subject to state monopoly purchase and marketing should generally not exceed the state monopoly price; the self-produced, self-sold, and self-purchased materials subject to state unified purchase by farmers should be traded around the state-stipulated price; the prices of open materials should generally be negotiated by the buyers and sellers themselves, but for certain products where supply and demand are imbalanced and price increases affect people's lives, price negotiation methods should be adopted for management.

In terms of strengthening administrative management, in addition to restricting the unfavorable aspects of the free market to the national economy and people's livelihood through tax policies, it has been determined to register existing public and private industrial and commercial enterprises and handicrafts, clean up and reissue licenses, strengthen the legal system, severely handle illegal activities, and crack down on speculation. In order to uniformly manage market prices, the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee have also decided that the province, special administrative regions, cities, and counties should all establish special market price management agencies.

### 开展宣传教育  加强组织领导  河北着手全面解决市场问题

    开展宣传教育  加强组织领导
    河北着手全面解决市场问题
    新华社保定1日电  新华社记者胡承清、冯代松报道：河北省领导机关开始着手全面解决当前市场上存在的问题。
    河北省当前市场上出现了一些值得注意的情况，这些是：在自由市场交易的物资超过了规定的范围，一些国家统购统销的物资和委托国营商业、合作社商业统一收购的物资也流入了自由市场，有的地区农民和小商贩贩运的粮食竟达到粮食市场交易量的20％到30％，价格比国家规定的牌价高出很多。甚至连粮票都成为投机者买卖的对象。对于国家统一收购的物资，有一些农业社和农民不履行预购或订购合同卖给国家，而拿到自由市场出售，价格比国家牌价高50％到一倍。不少单位出高价在市场上抢购，这就更助长了农民这种不正确的作法。自由市场因缺乏积极的领导和管理，有些物资比如蔬菜、鲜蛋等价格上涨很多，这些物资国营公司、供销社应该经营，而有些地方没有积极经营。不少小贩在市场上投机倒把，欺骗顾客，牟取暴利。
    另一方面工业、手工业和其他部门有不少单位到市场上以高价竞购原料。有些单位甚至对自己不需要的物资也大量抢购，囤积起来准备向其他单位交换。
    一些工业品和许多手工业品的价格上涨，其中有一些是应该提的，但也有一些是因为高价抢购原料或追求利润而不合理地提高价格的。
    中共河北省委和河北省人民委员会最近认真研究了这些情况，认为造成上述混乱情况的原因，主要是今年不少物资供应不足，而河北省去年遭受严重水灾，粮食、棉花、油料等主要农产品减产，使某些主要物资的供求关系更加紧张。
    中共河北省委和河北省人民委员会决定在全面开展增产节约运动、按统筹兼顾、合理安排的精神，统一平衡分配物资，缓和当前物资供不应求这个矛盾的同时，广泛的开展宣传教育，改进经济工作和行政管理，加强组织领导，以克服上述市场的混乱现象。
    省委和省人民委员会确定在5月份向中共党员、国家干部和广大群众进行一次宣传教育，使他们了解当前市场的混乱情况，引导他们批判资本主义倾向和各种不正确的看法和作法，从而使干部能够掌握正确处理市场问题的方法，使群众自觉遵守国家的政策法令。
    在贯彻执行政策方面，省委和省人民委员会决定对于粮食、棉花、油料等国家统购统销物资严加管理，禁止商贩贩运经营。农民在完成对国家的交售任务以后的剩余部分，允许进行品种交换、互通有无或加工复制出售，但不准动用口粮和种籽。对国家统一收购的物资，农业社和农民必须首先履行同国家订立的预购、定购合同，在完成向国家的交售任务以后，剩余部分允许在当地市场自产自销，禁止贩运经营。对于开放自由市场的物资如鸡、鸭、鱼、蛋、蔬菜、小土副产品等，允许农业社和农民自产自销和购买自用，允许商贩贩运经营。为了掌握货源，稳定市场，国营和合作社商业也要积极扩大经营，并克服机关化和机械呆板的经营方法，学会做生意。
    对农民贸易，必须限制在国家规定的范围内。一般地区的农业社和农民的贩运活动，应该坚决停止，他们开设的店铺应限期结束。经营开放物资的灾区农民，也要根据生产和生活的具体情况逐渐停止其经营活动。
    对市场价格，分别不同物资加以管理。国家统购统销的物资在市场互通有无，一般不得超过国家统销牌价；对国家统一收购的物资，农民自产自销自购自用的要围绕国家规定牌价交易；开放的物资一般买卖双方自行议价，但某些产品供求失调，价格上涨影响人民生活的应采取议价办法加以管理。
    在加强行政管理方面，除通过税收政策限制自由市场不利于国计民生的一面以外，确定对现有的公私工商业、手工业进行登记，清理换发证照和加强法制，严肃处理违法活动，打击投机。为了能够统一地管理市场物价，省委和省人民委员会还决定省、各专区、各市县都要建立市场物价的专管机构。
