Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 12th. On the morning of the 9th, on the Ussuri River, a river shared by China and the Soviet Union, not far from Raohe County in Heilongjiang Province, two small boats carrying supplies for our surveying team and a small boat belonging to farmers from Raohe County carrying potatoes suddenly encountered a strong wind. One small boat sank in the middle of the river, and the other two drifted onto the shore in Soviet territory, with water also pouring into the boats. Upon learning of the situation, the Soviet border guards immediately dispatched a steamboat to the middle of the river for rescue, rescuing one surveying team member from the sinking boat. At 8:00 PM that evening, the five rescued Chinese surveying team members and farmers were safely transported to Raohe County, and almost all of the sunken supplies and instruments were salvaged. Only one construction worker from the surveying team who fell into the water has not been found, despite the Soviet border guards searching in the water for eight or nine hours. On the morning of the 10th, the Soviet border guards continued to send boats to help search for the worker.

    苏军战士见义勇为
    乌苏里江上营救我同胞
    新华社哈尔滨12日电　9日上午，在距离黑龙江省饶河县城不远中苏两国共有的乌苏里江江面上，两只坐有我国勘测队员运送物资的小船和一只饶河县农民运土豆的小船，突然遇到了大风。一只小船在江心下沉，另外两只小船漂到苏联境内的岸滩上，船里也灌进了水。苏联边防军知道这个情况后，立即出动汽船前往江心营救，在沉船上救出一名勘测队员。当天晚间八时，五个遇险被救的我国勘探队员和农民已被平安地送到饶河县城，落水的物资和仪器也差不多全部被捞出。只有一名落水的勘测队的民工，经过苏联边防军战士在水中打捞了八、九小时，还没有找到。10日上午，苏联边防军继续派出船只帮助寻找那名民工。
