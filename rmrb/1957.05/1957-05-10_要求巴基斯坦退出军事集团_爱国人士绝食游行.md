Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, 9th. As the Baghdad Pact Council meeting is scheduled to be held in Karachi in early June, public opinion in Pakistan has once again erupted with calls against this military treaty.

	Five members of the Karachi Civil Liberties Committee began a hunger strike in front of the Presidential Palace on the evening of May 7th, demanding that Pakistan withdraw from the Baghdad Pact and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, and that civil liberties be restored domestically.

	According to today's "Achievement Daily" report, these hunger strikers, when interviewed by reporters, said that the government did not seek the opinion of the people when joining the Baghdad Pact and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. They demanded a national referendum on this issue. Karachi National Party workers paraded on the main streets of the city on May 6th, shouting slogans demanding the cancellation of military treaties, the abolition of security laws, and the elimination of the landlord system.

    要求巴基斯坦退出军事集团
    爱国人士绝食游行
    新华社卡拉奇9日电　巴格达条约理事会会议将在6月初在卡拉奇举行。巴基斯坦公众当中再次迸发了反对这个军事条约的呼声。
    卡拉奇公民自由委员会的五个委员5月7日晚上在总统府前面开始绝食，他们要求巴基斯坦退出巴格达条约和东南亚条约组织，要求在国内恢复公民自由。
    据今天的“成就报”报道，这些绝食的人在接见记者时说，政府在参加巴格达条约和东南亚条约组织时并没有征求人民的意见。他们要求全国对这个问题举行公民投票。卡拉奇国民党的工作人员于5月6日在市内主要街道上游行，高呼要求取消军事条约、废除安全法和消灭地主制的口号。
