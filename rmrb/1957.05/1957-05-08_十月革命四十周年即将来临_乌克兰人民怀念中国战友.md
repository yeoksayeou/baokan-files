    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 7th. Newly discovered documents in Kyiv prove that during the Soviet war against foreign interventionists and White bandits, many Chinese residing in Russia dedicated their lives to the establishment of the Ukrainian Soviet regime. As the fortieth anniversary of the October Revolution approaches, the Ukrainian people remember them with gratitude.

    According to the "Literary Gazette," Liu Saxian (音译) and a large number of Chinese workers were logging forests in Siberia before World War I. After the October Revolution, Liu Saxian and Chinese workers joined the International Brigades. He served as a political leader in one of the best platoons of the International Brigades. In the struggle to establish the Soviet regime in Ukraine, many Chinese Red Army soldiers sacrificed their lives. Liu Saxian heroically sacrificed himself in a battle with an enemy armored train in the Poltava region. (Attached picture)

    十月革命四十周年即将来临
    乌克兰人民怀念中国战友
    据新华社莫斯科7日电　在基辅新发现的文件证明，在苏联反对外国干涉军和白匪军的战争中，许多侨居俄国的中国人曾经为乌克兰苏维埃政权的建立献出了自己的生命。当十月革命四十周年即将来临的时候，乌克兰人民怀着感激的心情怀念着他们。
    据“文学报”报道，在第一次世界大战前夕，刘萨先（音译）和一大批中国工人在西伯利亚砍伐森林。十月革命以后，刘萨先和中国工人参加了国际纵队。他在国际纵队的一个最优秀的排里担任政治领导工作。在乌克兰建立苏维埃政权的斗争中，有不少中国籍的红军战士献出了自己的生命。在波尔塔发地区的一次同敌人装甲列车的搏斗中，刘萨先光荣地牺牲了。（附图片）
