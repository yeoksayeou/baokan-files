Xinhua News Agency, 11th - The head of the Sixth Office of the State Council told Xinhua reporters today that the State Council's instruction today on rationally organizing and utilizing freight vehicles of institutions and enterprises has very significant economic implications. This is a major measure for the country to implement increasing production and practicing economy in the highway transportation sector.

He said that freight vehicles of institutions and enterprises are a considerable transportation force. However, this force is currently experiencing significant waste in its utilization. The purpose of the State Council's instruction today is to leverage the transportation potential of this segment, without affecting the transportation needs of the institutions and enterprises themselves, through appropriate means to meet the country's growing needs for highway transportation.

According to preliminary statistics, there are over 35,000 freight vehicles belonging to institutions and enterprises nationwide, which is close to the number of freight vehicles in the national highway transportation department. Most of them are new vehicles with large load capacities. Many institutions, organizations, and schools have purchased one or two, or three to five trucks, which are only used to pick up and drop off personnel in the morning and evening or to handle temporary transportation tasks (some even use a large truck to transport only a few hundred pounds of goods). The vehicles have very few regular tasks and are idle most of the time. Many production and construction enterprises and business departments, although they have relatively large transportation tasks and a large number of vehicles, have not fully utilized the transportation efficiency of the vehicles due to uneven business and seasonal influences. Another characteristic of freight vehicles of institutions and enterprises is that they often transport goods one way, with most returning or departing empty. Coupled with generally poor management conditions, the utilization efficiency is relatively low. According to a typical survey of 268 units and 991 freight vehicles in Shenyang, the average utilization efficiency of vehicles in institutions and enterprises is only about 43% of that of state-owned transportation departments. It is estimated that the national situation is similar to that of Shenyang. On the one hand, the country lacks transportation vehicles and transportation is very strained. On the other hand, many institutions and enterprises have vehicles that are idle or whose efficiency is not fully utilized. This is a very unreasonable phenomenon.

The head of the office said that the main spirit of the State Council's instruction is to strengthen the management of vehicles of institutions and enterprises and implement unified and planned transportation. That is to say, appropriate production targets should be set for the self-owned freight vehicles of institutions and enterprises. In addition to prioritizing the use of their own vehicles to transport their own goods, the surplus transportation capacity of each unit should be allocated other transportation tasks by the local transportation department. This method was piloted to varying degrees last year in Tianjin, Wuhan, Yunnan, Liaoning and other provinces and cities. Last year, transportation departments across the country completed a total of over 9.6 million tons of freight volume and over 500 million ton-kilometers by organizing and utilizing the surplus transportation capacity of freight vehicles of institutions and enterprises. The experience of various regions proves that it is possible to organize the freight vehicles of institutions and enterprises and utilize them rationally. Doing so is not only beneficial to the country but also beneficial to the units with vehicles. For example, the Beijing Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics has four freight vehicles, which originally had very low utilization efficiency. Later, after consultation with the Beijing Transportation Department, it was decided that, on the premise of ensuring the transportation needs of the unit, the surplus transportation capacity of these four vehicles would be uniformly dispatched and used by the transportation department to participate in planned transportation. In more than a year, these vehicles not only completed the transportation of more than 16,000 tons of materials for the country, but also earned more than 40,000 yuan in freight, leaving a surplus of more than 20,000 yuan after deducting various expenses, which is equivalent to the price of a new Jiefang brand truck.

However, rationally organizing and utilizing freight vehicles of institutions and enterprises is a very complex and meticulous task. Because these vehicles are scattered among various units and are related to the production, business, and interests of various departments. Therefore, this work must be carried out in various ways, taking into account the different situations and characteristics, on the premise of adapting to the transportation needs of the units with vehicles, in order to achieve the expected results. Considering that China's experience in organizing vehicles of institutions and enterprises to participate in planned transportation is still insufficient, the State Council pointed out in its instructions that the production targets for freight vehicles of institutions and enterprises should not be set too high in the initial stage. Management should also not be too strict or inflexible. Vehicles for internal transportation in industrial and mining enterprises, vehicles for certain special tasks (such as vehicles needed by surveying teams), and special vehicles (such as oil tankers, refrigerated trucks, etc.) may be allowed not to participate in unified planned transportation. At the same time, there should also be a certain degree of flexibility in the planning for vehicles of institutions and enterprises participating in unified planned transportation. These regulations are all very necessary, and they reflect that the State Council's approach is both practical and flexible.

The head of the office said that in order to do a good job in rationally organizing and utilizing vehicles of institutions and enterprises, all institutions and enterprises with vehicles must also strengthen their overall socialist concept and overcome departmentalism, which only seeks convenience for their own units and disregards the needs and difficulties of the entire country. At the same time, transportation departments in various regions should also strive to improve their work and, when organizing and utilizing vehicles of institutions and enterprises, should try to simplify procedures and reduce the troubles of the units with vehicles. When allocating goods, vehicles of institutions and enterprises should be treated the same as vehicles of transportation departments and should be given regular guidance and assistance in technical and business matters. In short, in promoting this work, transportation departments and institutions and enterprises with vehicles should fully cooperate and support each other.

In view of the fact that state-owned enterprises, especially enterprises under the central industrial ministries, account for the largest number of freight vehicles of institutions and enterprises, the central departments in charge should attach importance to this work and instruct their subordinate units to earnestly implement this instruction of the State Council. Enterprises with a relatively large number of vehicles should also make doing a good job in this work one of the contents of increasing production and practicing economy. Relevant departments in various regions should also pay attention to studying and solving the problems of gasoline, parts supply, and repairs after the vehicles of institutions and enterprises participate in unified planned transportation, in order to better implement the State Council's instructions.

Finally, the head of the office said that although the State Council's instructions were formulated after summarizing the experience of the pilot implementation in the past two years and repeatedly consulting with various departments and regions, and most units agreed with this method, this method is not perfect and some difficulties may be encountered in the implementation in various regions. Therefore, it is hoped that all units will not develop resistance when encountering some difficulties, and abandon the effort because of a minor setback. Instead, they should overcome difficulties from a positive perspective, create more good methods in light of local conditions, and exchange and promote them in a timely manner.

    公路运输部门增产节约的重大措施
    国务院第六办公室负责人谈合理组织运用机关企业货运汽车的意义
    新华社11日讯　国务院第六办公室负责人今天对新华社记者说，国务院今天发出的关于合理组织运用机关、企业货运汽车的指示具有十分重大的经济意义，这是国家在公路运输部门实行增产节约的一项重大措施。
    他说，机关、企业的货运汽车是一支不小的运输力量。但是这个力量目前在使用上还存在着很大的浪费。国务院今天发出这个指示的目的，就是在不影响机关、企业自身运输需要的前提下，将这部分汽车的运输潜力通过适当的办法发挥出来，以满足国家公路运输不断增长的需要。
    据初步统计，全国机关、企业的货运汽车共达三万五千多辆，接近全国公路运输部门的货运汽车的数量，而且大部分都是载重量大的新车。许多机关、团体、学校买了一二辆或三五辆卡车，只是用来早晚接送上下班的人员或应付临时的运输任务（有的甚至拉几百斤的东西也用一个大卡车跑一趟），车子的经常任务很少，大部分的时间在闲着。许多生产、建设企业和业务部门，运输的任务虽然比较大，车辆的数量也很多，但是由于业务的不均衡和季节性的影响，车子的运输效率也没有充分发挥。机关、企业货运汽车的另一个特点是单程运输多，在回程或去程的时候绝大部分是空驶，加上一般管理条件差，因而使用效率就比较低。根据沈阳市从二百六十八个单位、九百九十一辆货车的典型调查，机关、企业汽车的平均使用效率仅达国营运输部门的43％左右。全国的情况估计同沈阳的情况也相差不多。一方面是国家运输车辆不足，运输很紧张，一方面却有许多机关、企业的汽车闲着或效率没有充分发挥，这是很不合理的现象。
    负责人说，国务院的指示，主要精神就是对机关、企业汽车加强管理，实行统一的有计划的运输。这就是说，对机关、企业的自用货车要规定适当的生产指标。各单位除用自备车辆优先运送本部门的货物外，多余的运力应由当地运输部门分配其他的运输任务。这个办法去年天津、武汉、云南、辽宁等省市都在不同程度上试行了。去年全国各地运输部门通过组织运用机关、企业货运汽车的多余运力，共约完成了货运量九百六十多万吨、五亿多吨公里。各地试行的经验证明，把机关、企业的货运汽车组织起来，加以合理运用是可能的。这样做不仅对国家有利，对有车单位也有利。例如，北京航空学院有四辆货运汽车，原来使用效率很低，后来经北京市运输部门协商，在保证本单位的运输需要的前提下，将这四辆汽车的多余运力由运输部门统一调度使用，参加计划运输。在一年多的时间内，这些车辆不仅给国家完成了一万六千多吨物资的运输任务，而且本单位还收入运费四万多元，除掉各项开支外，还赢余二万多元，相当于一辆解放牌新汽车的价钱。
    但是，合理地组织运用机关、企业货运汽车是一项十分复杂而细致的工作。因为这些车辆都是分散属于各个单位，关系到各个部门的生产、业务和利益。因此，这项工作必须在适应有车单位运输需要的前提下，分别不同的情况和特点，采取多种多样的方式来进行，这样才能达到预期的效果。考虑到在我国组织机关、企业的汽车参加计划运输的工作经验还不足，因此，国务院指示中指出，对机关、企业货运汽车的生产指标初期不宜规定过高。管理也不宜过严过死，对工矿内部运输车辆、某些有特殊任务的车辆（如勘测队所需车辆）和特种车辆（如运油车、冷藏车等）可允许它们不参加统一计划运输。同时对参加统一计划运输的机关、企业车辆，在计划方面也应有一定的伸缩性。这些规定都是很必要的，它反映了国务院指示的做法是既符合实际情况又是灵活的。
    负责人说，为了做好合理组织运用机关、企业汽车的工作，各个有车的机关、企业还必须加强社会主义的整体观念，克服只图本单位使用方便，不顾整个国家需要和困难的本位主义思想。同时，各地运输部门也要努力改进工作，在组织运用机关、企业汽车的时候，要尽量地简化手续，减少有车单位的麻烦。在配载货物时，对机关、企业汽车要和对运输部门的汽车同等看待，并且注意在技术业务方面给予经常的指导和帮助。总之，在推行这项工作中，交通运输部门和有车的机关、企业都应充分协作，互相支援。
    鉴于机关、企业的货运汽车中，国营企业特别是中央各个工业部所属企业的汽车占的数量最大，因此中央各个主管部门要重视这项工作，要指示所属单位认真执行国务院这一指示。拥有汽车比较多的企业还要把做好这项工作做为增产节约的内容之一。各地有关部门还要注意研究解决机关、企业汽车参加统一计划运输以后，汽油、配件的供应和修理等问题，以利更好地贯彻国务院的指示。
    负责人最后说，国务院的指示，虽然是总结了近两年来试行的经验，并且同各个部门、各个地方反复协商研究以后才制定的，大多数单位都赞成这个办法，但是这个办法还不是十全十美，各地在推行中还可能遇到一些困难。因此，希望各单位不要因为碰到一些困难就发生抵触思想，因噎废食，而应该从积极方面克服困难，因地制宜地多创造一些好的办法，并及时交流推广。
