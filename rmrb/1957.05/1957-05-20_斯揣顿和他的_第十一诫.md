Strijdom and His "Eleventh Commandment"

It is said that the Prime Minister of the Union of South Africa, Strijdom, is a devout believer. However, what he has always faithfully adhered to is not God's "Ten Commandments," but his own "Eleventh Commandment"—not to associate with people of color as equals.

"My skin is white!" he said. "If a European loses his sense of color, he can no longer remain a white person." In Strijdom's view, white people are destined to be masters, and people of other colors are only fit to be slaves.

Recently, one thing has greatly troubled this white supremacist: the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference will be held in June, and a new figure will attend this conference. His name is Nkrumah, and he is a black man; the country he represents is called Ghana, a country ruled by Africans themselves. To sit at the same table with such a person for a meeting, wouldn't that violate his "Eleventh Commandment!"

What to do?

According to the British "Daily Telegraph," Strijdom has made a decision: he will not attend this Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference, and will let the Minister of Finance, Eric Louw, lead the delegation of the Union of South Africa.

But, if Eric Louw asks Strijdom a question: "Mr. Prime Minister, your 'sense of color' is preserved. But what about mine? I am your minister." How would Strijdom answer?

According to Strijdom's argument, there should be no countries like Ghana in the world. The reason is very simple, in his own words: "If the right to vote is extended to non-Europeans, if Africans gain representation and voting rights and non-Europeans develop on the same basis as Europeans, then how can Europeans continue to be masters... ." But, the problem now is no longer an "if."

Africans have begun to awaken! Ghana's independence is already a fact. It is a starting gun, and more countries ruled by Africans themselves will follow. Their representatives will become increasingly important figures on the international stage. What will happen to Strijdom, who adheres to the "Eleventh Commandment"? Not only that, how long can the era of "Europeans as masters" continue even in the Union of South Africa under Strijdom's rule?

Indeed, South African white supremacists are intensifying their efforts to maintain their "sense of color." On March 25, the parliament of the Union of South Africa passed a bill enforcing racial segregation in churches—promoting the "Eleventh Commandment" before God.

However, despite dozens of racial segregation measures, and the exhaustion of all kinds of barbaric means such as whipping, imprisonment, and exile, the resistance and boycott activities of non-Europeans in the Union of South Africa have never stopped. Therefore, even the South African Minister of Justice, Swart, who insists on the opinion that "if blacks are allowed equal opportunities, whites cannot survive," has to admit that they are "sitting on a volcano." This is an active volcano. It will eventually erupt and turn the believers of the "Eleventh Commandment" sitting on it into ashes. In the large-scale boycott movement against bus fare increases by non-Europeans in South Africa, people can already hear the rumbling sound of the earth's core.

### 斯揣顿和他的“第十一诫”

    斯揣顿和他的“第十一诫”
    据说，南非联邦总理斯揣顿是个虔诚的教徒。然而，他一向信守不渝的倒不是上帝的“十诫”，而是他自己规定的“第十一诫”——不和有色人平等往来。
   “我的肤色是白的！”他说：“如果欧洲人失去了他的肤色感，他就不可能仍然是一个白种人。”在斯揣顿看来，白种人命定要做主人，其余肤色的人只配做奴隶。
    最近，有一件事情使得这位白种至上主义者大伤脑筋：英联邦总理会议在6月份要开会了，有一个新的人物将出席这次会议。他叫恩克鲁玛，是一个黑人；他所代表的国家叫加纳，是一个由非洲人自己作主人的国家。要同这样一个人坐在一张桌子上开会，岂非违背了他的“第十一诫！”
    怎么办呢？
    据英国“每日电讯报”报道，斯揣顿已经作出了决定：他不出席这次英联邦总理会议了，让财政部长埃里克·赫·劳来率领南非联邦的代表团。
    可是，埃里克·赫·劳如果向斯揣顿提出一个问题：“总理先生，您的‘肤色感’是保全了。可是我的呢？我是你的部长呀。”斯揣顿又如何来回答呢？
    按照斯揣顿的主张，世界上根本就不应当有像加纳那样的国家。理由很简单，用他自己的话来说：“如果选举权扩及非欧洲人，如果非洲人获得代表权和投票权而且非欧洲人是在和欧洲人相同的基础上发展的话，那么，欧洲人如何能够继续做主人……。”但是，现在的问题已经不是一个“如果”了。
    非洲人已经开始觉醒了！加纳独立已经是一个事实。它是一声号炮，跟着将会出现更多的非洲人自己作主人的国家。他们的代表将在国际舞台上成为越来越重要的角色。信守“第十一诫”的斯揣顿又将如何呢？不仅如此，就是在斯揣顿统治下的南非联邦，“欧洲人做主人”的时代又能继续多久呢？
    不错，南非白种主义者在维护“肤色感”方面，正在变本加厉。3月25日，南非联邦的议会通过了在教堂实行种族隔离的法案——在上帝面前推行“第十一诫”。
    然而，尽管有几十种种族隔离措施，使尽了鞭笞、监禁和放逐等等各种野蛮手段，南非联邦非欧洲人的反抗和抵制活动从来没有停止过。所以，连坚持“如果允许黑人有平等机会，白人就不能生存下去”这种意见的南非联邦司法部长斯瓦特也不得不承认，他们是“坐在火山口上”。这是一座活火山。它终将爆发，把坐在它上面的“第十一诫”信奉者化为灰烬。在南非非欧洲人对公共汽车涨价的大规模抵制运动中，人们已经可以听到地浆隆隆翻腾的声音了。
