Banners and flags fly like a tide, surging into the great Tiananmen Square,
    The ranks of people clearly marked "May First," relying on labor to build a golden fortress.
The leaders of China and the Soviet Union rejoice together,
    No wonder the world looks at us with new eyes,
Representing eight hundred million people from both sides,
    Today we first celebrate the great reunion.
A clear sky echoes with the sound of pigeon bells,
    Ten thousand wings soar, heralding peace,
The singing resounds through the clouds,
    Together answering the thunderous cheers of "Long Live!"
Lion and dragon dances compete in bravery,
    Teams separately perform their skills,
The lion's awakening and the dragon's flight both have meaning,
    Not like the revelry of a Lantern Festival.
Teams form into colorful clouds,
    Much adornment promotes the new,
Old and young alike fill the streets,
    Advancing towards science with great strides.
Nation-building has always relied on workers and peasants,
    A diligent and thrifty foundation is even more exceptional,
Many models and statistics,
    Rely on human effort to replace the work of heaven.
The country is unified with many ethnic groups,
    Sharing the same breath, each with its own fragrance,
Like many stars all arching towards the North Star,
    Ten thousand rays of light emanate from the heavenly street.
How much better are fireworks than cannon fire,
    Bringing smiles to the faces of the elderly,
Auspicious light illuminates the night like day,
    Ten thousand eyes converge on the reviewing stand.
I once heard that virtuous rule does not involve observing troops,
    Why should military preparations boast of martial prowess?
Those who have the Way naturally receive much assistance,
    Today, the people's will is already like a city wall.
Celebrating at the same time as rectification,
    Spring warmth and autumn severity serve the same purpose,
It can be known that the meaning of vigilance and diligence,
    Is embodied in the songs and dances in the streets.

    一九五七年劳动节同庆歌
    叶恭绰如潮旌旆尽飞扬，拥入天门大广场，人队分明标五一，要凭劳动作金汤。中苏元首两相欢，争怪全球另眼看，代表双方人八亿，今朝先庆大团圆。一片晴空漾鸽铃，冲天万翼兆和平，歌声响彻云霄里，同答如雷万岁声。狮龙跃舞竞骁腾，队队分曹奏尔能，狮醒龙飞都有意，岂同元夜哄春灯。队队团成五色云，几多装点尽推陈，满街耆老偕青少，科学同时大进军。由来建国赖工农，勤俭开基更不同，几许模型兼统计，要凭人力代天功。国家统一多民族，同气连枝各自芳，比似众星齐拱北，天街万道出光芒。炮火何如焰火佳，好教伏老笑颜开，祥光照彻宵如昼，万目齐趋检阅台。曾闻耀德不观兵，军备何须侈武成，得道自然多得助，只今民意早如城。庆祝同时即整风，春温秋肃本同功，可知惕励忧勤意，即寓衢歌巷舞中。
