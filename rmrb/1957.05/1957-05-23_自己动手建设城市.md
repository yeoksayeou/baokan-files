    Building the City with Our Own Hands

    This newspaper reports that factory, mine and government employees, young students, and officers and soldiers of the garrison in Shenyang are currently using their own hands to assist the government in opening up an open channel project, eight kilometers long and thirty meters wide, so that within two months, the rainwater accumulation and industrial wastewater in the Tiexi Industrial Zone can be smoothly discharged into the Hun River in the suburbs. Currently, thousands of people participate in voluntary labor every day.

    The broad masses of Shenyang have proposed to contribute 700,000 voluntary labor days this year to participate in various municipal construction projects. They will plant more than 730,000 trees, newly build 198,000 square meters of cinder roads, and construct ten projects in total, including open-air swimming pools, parks, sports shooting ranges, and water storage ponds.

    自己动手建设城市
    本报讯　沈阳市厂矿机关职工、青年学生、驻军官兵，目前正用自己的双手协助政府开辟一条长八公里宽三十公尺的明渠工程，以便在两个月内，使铁西工业区的雨季积水和工业用的废水顺利地排流到市郊的浑河中去。现每天有上千人参加义务劳动。
    沈阳市广大群众已提出今年要拿出七十万个义务劳动日参加市政各项建设。他们要植树七十三万多株，新修十九万八千多平方公尺的煤渣路，修建露天游泳池、公园、体育射击靶场、贮水池等工程共十项。　　　　　　　　　（殿选）
