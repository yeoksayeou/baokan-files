Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch: Since April 27th, the State Ethnic Affairs Commission has continuously invited ethnic minority cadres from its affiliated organs, as well as professors and lecturers of various ethnic groups from the Central Institute for Nationalities, to hold symposiums to discuss issues of internal contradictions among the people and ethnic relations, and to solicit opinions on ethnic work and the State Ethnic Affairs Commission.

The third symposium was held on the afternoon of the 9th, with more than 100 people participating. Many criticisms were raised at the meeting regarding the implementation of ethnic policies. Kim Man-seon (Korean nationality), Director of the Korean Translation Section of the Translation Bureau of the State Ethnic Affairs Commission, believed that the State Ethnic Affairs Commission did not care enough about ethnic minority cadres working in Beijing, and that Han chauvinism still existed in some institutions in Beijing. Kim Man-seon said that ethnic minority cadres were happy to come to Beijing to work, but many contradictions could not be resolved. Relevant departments treated ethnic minority cadres the same way as Han cadres, not allowing them to bring nannies from their hometowns, which was not suitable for ethnic minority cadres. "You need to know that nannies are there to teach children to speak and educate children. How can children learn their own ethnic language and customs from Han nannies?" Some ethnic minority cadres' spouses can do a lot of things in their own ethnic groups, but after coming to Beijing, because they do not understand Chinese, they cannot do much and will not feel at ease, but the leading organs have not tried to help them learn Chinese.

Fu Zhengchao, an Yi cadre from the Translation Bureau, said that the Translation Bureau did not respect or care enough about the customs and habits of ethnic minority cadres. Zhong Dihua (Xibe nationality), a lecturer at the Central Institute for Nationalities, said that the Central Institute for Nationalities did not pay close enough attention to the studies of ethnic minority cadres who came to study, and did not care enough about the progress of ethnic minority teachers. He felt that he had not made much progress in the few years he had been in Beijing. He believed that the Central Institute for Nationalities should not be too accommodating to ethnic minority students in terms of learning, as being too accommodating would not benefit them. Zhong Dihua said that the Central Institute for Nationalities also needed to conduct education on friendship and unity among students of all ethnic groups. Even among students of various ethnic groups at the Central Institute for Nationalities, there was still a phenomenon of not respecting the customs and habits of ethnic minority students.

Awang Dengzhu (Tibetan nationality), a lecturer at the Central Institute for Nationalities, said that some Han comrades looked down on ethnic minorities, so ethnic minority comrades were not very willing to approach them. He said that the reason for this phenomenon was that the propaganda on ethnic work was too weak, there was a lack of mutual understanding between ethnic groups, and Han comrades knew too little about ethnic minorities. Awang Dengzhu said that, in his opinion, apart from Han cadres who specifically worked on ethnic minorities, other Han comrades did not understand ethnic minorities at all. They did not know what advantages ethnic minorities had and thought that ethnic minorities were backward in every way. He suggested that the State Ethnic Affairs Commission strengthen the propaganda work on ethnic policies and launch a campaign to publicize ethnic policies nationwide.

Hu Xianjin, Associate Professor of the Cultural Relics Research Office of the Research Department of the Central Institute for Nationalities, said that until now, Han chauvinism still surrounds us like a vast ocean. Many people only see the backward side of ethnic minorities and do not see their strengths. Therefore, some people say that ethnic minorities are backward and can only follow the Han people. This statement is wrong. She hoped that more investigation and research could be conducted on all aspects of ethnic minorities and that the excellent traditions of ethnic minorities could be introduced to the people of the whole country. Hu Xianjin criticized the relevant departments for not paying attention to the research work of ethnic minority cultural relics. It is said that the Central Institute for Nationalities has more than 30,000 pieces of ethnic minority cultural relics, but there are only three rooms for the exhibition hall, and many valuable cultural relics have not been able to meet the audience for a long time. Some professors at the meeting said that the internal information of the State Ethnic Affairs Commission was too restricted, which affected research work.

Sa Kongliao, Vice Chairman of the State Ethnic Affairs Commission, said that everyone had put forward many valuable opinions at the three symposiums, which was of great benefit to our work improvement, and hoped that everyone would continue to speak more openly. Yang Jingren, Vice Chairman of the State Ethnic Affairs Commission, said that the rectification campaign of the Chinese Communist Party organizations at all levels within the State Ethnic Affairs Commission has begun. The rectification campaign relies on criticism and self-criticism within the Party, as well as the help of non-Party comrades. We sincerely welcome the criticism from non-Party comrades of all ethnic groups. Only by attacking from both inside and outside can we rectify the work well. Finally, Yang Jingren announced several measures taken by the State Ethnic Affairs Commission based on the opinions at the symposium: (1) Making the regular convening of such symposiums a regular system for leading cadres of the State Ethnic Affairs Commission and the Chinese Communist Party organizations within the State Ethnic Affairs Commission to listen to the opinions of cadres of all ethnic groups and non-Party comrades; (2) Appointing a special person to form a working group and absorbing ethnic minority cadres to immediately study and solve the demands and difficulties of ethnic minority cadres; (3) Appointing a special person to be responsible for studying the methods of providing internal information for professors of the Institute for Nationalities, so as to ensure that it can be resolved in the short term.

The symposium will continue next week.

### 在京少数民族干部在民委召开的座谈会上建议  在全国开展宣传民族政策的运动

    在京少数民族干部在民委召开的座谈会上建议
    在全国开展宣传民族政策的运动
    据新华社10日讯　从4月27日以来，民族事务委员会连续邀请所属机关的少数民族干部、中央民族学院的各族教授和讲师举行座谈会，座谈人民内部矛盾问题和民族关系问题，征求对民族工作和民族事务委员会的意见。
    9日下午举行了第三次座谈会，参加座谈会的共一百多人。会上对执行民族政策方面提出了许多批评意见。民委翻译局朝鲜文翻译处处长金万善（朝鲜族）认为，民族事务委员会对来京工作的少数民族干部关心不够，北京的某些机关里还存在大汉族主义思想。金万善说，少数民族干部高兴来北京工作，可是有许多矛盾解决不了。有关部门对少数民族干部也像对汉族干部一样，不准他们从家乡带保姆，这对少数民族干部是不适合的，要知道，保姆是要教孩子说话的，要教育孩子的，孩子们怎么跟汉族保姆学习本民族的语言和习惯？有些少数民族干部的爱人在本民族中可以做很多事，到北京以后，因为她们不懂汉文汉语，做不了多少事，不会安心，而领导机关并未设法帮助她们学习汉文汉语。
    翻译局彝族干部傅正朝说，翻译局对少数民族干部的风俗习惯尊重不够，关心不够。中央民族学院讲师钟棣华（锡伯族）说，中央民族学院对来学习的少数民族干部的学习抓得不紧，对少数民族教师的进步太不关心，他觉得自己来北京几年了，进步并不大。他认为中央民族学院在学习方面不应当过分迁就少数民族学生，过分迁就对他们没有好处。钟棣华说，中央民族学院还需要对各族学生进行友爱团结的教育，在中央民族学院的各族同学之间，也还存在不尊重少数民族学生风俗习惯的现象。
    中央民族学院讲师阿旺登珠（藏族）说，有些汉族同志瞧不起少数民族，当然少数民族同志也就不大愿意接近他们。他说，造成这种现象的原因是对民族工作的宣传太薄弱，各民族之间互不了解，汉族同志对少数民族的了解太少。阿旺登珠说，据他看，现在除了专作少数民族工作的汉族干部以外，其他汉族同志根本不了解少数民族，他们不知道少数民族有那些长处，以为少数民族处处都落后。他建议民族事务委员会加强民族政策的宣传工作，在全国范围内开展一个宣传民族政策的运动。
    中央民族学院研究部文物研究室胡先晋副教授说，到现在，大汉族主义还像汪洋大海一样包围着我们，许多人只看见少数民族落后的一面，看不见他们的长处，因此，有人说少数民族落后，只有跟着汉族走。这种说法是错误的。她希望能对少数民族各方面的情况进行更多的调查研究，向全国人民多多介绍少数民族的优秀传统。胡先晋对有关方面不重视少数民族文物的研究工作提出了批评。据说，中央民族学院现有少数民族文物达三万多件，但是，展览室只有三间房子，许多宝贵的文物长期未能与观众见面。会上有的教授说，民族事务委员会的内部资料限制过严，影响研究工作。
    民族事务委员会副主任萨空了说，三次座谈会上大家提出了不少宝贵意见，对我们改进工作有很大好处，希望大家更加敞开地谈下去。民族事务委员会副主任杨静仁说，现在民族事务委员会内的各级中共组织整风开始了，整风依靠党内的批评和自我批评，也依靠党外同志的帮助。我们热诚欢迎党外各族同志的批评，只有内外夹攻，才能把风整好。最后，杨静仁宣布了民族事务委员会根据座谈会上的意见而采取的几项措施：（一）把定期召开这种座谈会，作为民族事务委员会的领导干部和民族事务委员会内中共党组织倾听各族干部和非党同志的意见的一种经常制度；（二）指定专人成立一个工作组，并吸收少数民族干部参加，立即着手研究解决少数民族干部的要求和困难；（三）指定专人负责研究供给民族学院教授们使用内部资料的办法，务使在短期内得到解决。
    座谈会将在下星期继续举行。
