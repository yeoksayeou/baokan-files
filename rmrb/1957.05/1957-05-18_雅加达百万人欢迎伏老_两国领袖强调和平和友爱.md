Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, May 17th: Approximately one million Jakarta citizens held a mass rally today, even more enthusiastic than those in other parts of Indonesia, to welcome Chairman Voroshilov.

When Chairman Voroshilov and President Sukarno appeared at the rally venue, the assembled masses cheered loudly.

Voroshilov said at the meeting that we are now in a historically significant era. Colonialism is heading towards extinction. Asian and African nations are reviving. The strength of these nations fighting for their own destiny is irresistible. Now, the nations of the East have joined in deciding international affairs. The Indonesian people have played a significant role in the anti-colonialist struggle.

Voroshilov said that since the Bandung Conference, the history of Asian and African nations has undergone great changes, and they are uniting to fight for complete independence and freedom. This was proven in the Egyptian incident. The aggressors wanted to subdue Egypt with an iron fist, but with the support of the people of the Soviet Union, China, India, Indonesia, and other countries, the aggression against Egypt suffered a shameful defeat. Friendly relations have been established between peace-loving countries, including the Soviet Union and Indonesia. He believes that the relationship between these two countries will continue to develop.

President Sukarno also delivered a speech at the meeting. He pointed out that Chairman Voroshilov has been warmly welcomed everywhere because the Soviet Union has helped and sympathized with Indonesia's struggle for independence.

Sukarno said, don't think that we will be satisfied if we get economic assistance and American aid. He said, no! The Indonesian nation cannot be satisfied without independence. Some countries say they are our friends, but they engage in subversion in Indonesia and are unwilling to return West Irian to the Indonesian people. He asked: How can this be considered friendship?

Sukarno said that what the nations of the world demand is equality, friendship, and peace. He finally expressed his hope that the Soviet and Indonesian people will be friends forever and jointly fight against colonialism and imperialism.

    雅加达百万人欢迎伏老
    两国领袖强调和平和友爱
    据新华社雅加达17日电　大约有一百万雅加达市民在今天举行了一个比印度尼西亚各地更加热烈的群众大会来欢迎伏罗希洛夫主席。
    当伏罗希洛夫主席和苏加诺总统在大会会场上出现的时候，到会群众高声欢呼。
    伏罗希洛夫在会上说，现在我们正处在有历史意义的时代。殖民主义正走向灭亡。亚非民族正在复兴。这些民族为了自己的命运而进行奋斗的力量是不可阻挡的。现在，东方各民族已经参加决定国际事务。在反殖民主义的斗争中，印度尼西亚人民起了显著的作用。
    伏罗希洛夫说，在万隆会议以后，亚非各民族的历史起了很大的变化，他们正在团结起来，为完全的独立自由而斗争。这点在埃及事件中得到证明。侵略者想用铁腕使埃及屈服，但是，埃及在苏联、中国、印度、印度尼西亚等国人民的支持下，使得对埃及的侵略遭到可耻的失败。各爱好和平的国家之间已经建立了友好的关系，其中包括苏联和印度尼西亚。他相信这两个国家的关系将不断地得到发展。
    苏加诺总统也在会上发表演说。他指出，伏罗希洛夫主席在各地受到热烈欢迎是因为苏联帮助和同情印度尼西亚的独立斗争。
    苏加诺说，不要认为我们得到经济援助和美援就会满足。他说，不！印度尼西亚民族如果得不到独立是不能满足的。有些国家说是我们的朋友，但是他们在印度尼西亚进行颠复活动，也不愿意把西伊里安还给印度尼西亚人民。他问道：这怎样算是朋友呢？
    苏加诺说，世界各民族要求的就是平等、友好和和平。他最后表示希望苏联和印度尼西亚人民永远友好，共同为反对殖民主义和帝国主义而斗争。
