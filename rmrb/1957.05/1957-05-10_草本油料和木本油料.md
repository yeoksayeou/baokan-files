Herbaceous oil crops include: peanuts, rapeseed, sesame, soybeans, flax, sunflowers, castor beans, and perilla. Sunflowers, castor beans, and perilla are all suitable for planting around houses, on hillsides, in wasteland, and along roadsides. Under normal circumstances, each sunflower can yield 2-4 liang (100-200 grams) of seeds, and each castor bean plant can yield 4-8 liang (200-400 grams) of seeds. In some southern regions, perennial castor bean plants can produce four to five jin (2-2.5 kilograms) of seeds per plant.

Woody oil crops include: oil camellia, tung oil tree, Chinese tallow tree, lacquer tree, walnut, oil palm, etc. Oil camellia and tung oil trees are suitable for planting on barren hills; roadsides and riverbanks are suitable for planting Chinese tallow trees. Oil camellia can produce 6-10 jin (3-5 kilograms) of oil camellia seeds per plant during its peak fruiting period, and Chinese tallow trees can produce about 15 jin (7.5 kilograms) of seeds per plant during their peak seed-bearing period. Oil camellia, tung oil trees, Chinese tallow trees, and lacquer trees can only be planted in the south, while oil palm is a subtropical crop, and walnuts are suitable for both the north and the south.

    草本油料和木本油料
    草本油料包括：花生、油菜、芝麻、大豆、胡麻、向日葵、蓖麻和苏子等。向日葵、蓖麻、苏子都适宜在住宅前后、山坡、荒地、路旁种植。在一般情况下，每株向日葵可收籽2—4市两，每株蓖麻能收籽4—8市两。在南方一些地区种植的多年生蓖麻，每株有结籽四、五斤的。
    木本油料包括：油茶、油桐、乌桕、漆树、核桃、油棕等。油茶、油桐适宜在荒山上栽种；路旁、河旁都适合栽种乌桕。油茶在结果旺期每株可产油茶籽6—10斤，乌桕结种旺期每株产种15斤左右。油茶、油桐、乌桕、漆树只能在南方种植，油棕是亚热带作物，核桃则是南北皆宜。
