    Watching the Henan Opera "Fan Opera"
      Chen Mengjia
    A few years ago, I watched Xiao Suqing from Quxhou perform "Three Flicking Sleeves" at the Jixiang Theater in Beijing. I found it pleasant to listen to, beautiful to watch, and the plot interesting. Since then, I have become fond of Henan Bangzi Opera. Later, I learned that this play was written by a Mr. Fan. Last year, Ma Jinfeng and Yan Lipin told me that Henan had criticized the "Fan Operas" that people loved to watch, and they were too afraid to perform them. This time in Xi'an, I made a special trip to visit Mr. Fan Cuiting of the Lion's Roar Troupe, visited their New Life Department, and watched children's opera in the crowded long chairs in the two large reed sheds of the People's Amusement Park. I was really happy. But even happier than me were the friends standing in the corridors with standing tickets. They are the true appreciators and supporters of Henan Opera.
    The author of Fan Opera, twenty-five years ago, came out of university, abandoned his official position for opera, broke off with his family, and became a "member of the opera troupe" in society. Suffering poverty and humiliation, he still insisted on teaching children's opera and "wrote" dozens of Henan Operas himself. These new scripts, including "Ye Hanyan" performed by the famous actress Chen Suzhen, have not been published, but all Henan Bangzi Opera troupes perform them and are very popular in rural areas. Before rehearsing a play, he would first discuss the story, the characters' personalities, and the actors, let them think about how to sing and act, and then write. During rehearsals, he paid special attention to "inner expressions" and the training of martial arts. He hired famous Peking Opera masters (now Xu Biyun) to instruct the actors. The lyrics of Fan Opera are all popular and easy to understand; in order to satisfy the audience's emotions, tragedy is often turned into comedy. Whether this approach is good or not can be discussed later, but the reason why his plays are loved by the people is that he writes plays for the audience. In the past and present, Fan Opera has achieved the goal of "being a play that the common people love to watch." There are inevitably some old-fashioned sentiments in this, but after watching many plays, I have not found any toxins. I watched "Han River Girl," which is said to be problematic, but it is just a story of love between a scholar's family and a "poor girl." I paid close attention to see if it was toxic, but I only felt it was good and did not see where the problem lay.
    During the War of Resistance Against Japan, this opera troupe suffered great hardships and retreated to the "slums" of the South Gate of Xi'an. Surrounded by three sides of manure factories, they performed in an empty field with a few scab-headed children. Now it's better. They have their own People's Amusement Park, dormitories, and perform in two teams, large and small. Last year, they performed in the countryside more than 170 times. They recently made a tour performance and also came to Beijing to contend. They did not bring any famous actors, but these children who have been trained for a long time, some with excellent skills, some with acrobatics, and even more with the hope of continuing to develop into the best actors. They brought two new Fan Operas—Wang Zuo Breaking His Arm and Splitting the Mountain to Save His Mother. These two plays have been welcomed in the Northwest, and friends in Tianjin have already written to report the grand occasion of the performances. They will definitely receive applause in Beijing as well.
    In Xi'an, I was entrusted by the children of the Lion's Roar New Life Department to introduce their teachers Fan Cuiting and Chang Jingti when I returned to Beijing. I cannot fail these children's hopes. Over the past few years, I have had great respect for Mr. Fan's work in Henan Opera creation, directing, and cultivating the second generation. His experience and achievements should be valued by the theater community. I have always believed that Beijing, as the center of China and the Mandarin-speaking area of North China, should have a Henan Opera House. This year, Cui Lantian has come, and more are coming. Let us see more of the excellent traditions in Henan Opera, and see more of the plays that many old people in North China love to watch. I carefully introduce Fan Opera and its author, believing that, like my introduction of the Quju opera "Yang Naiwu and Little Cabbage," it will not disappoint the audience.

    看豫剧“樊戏”
      陈梦家
    几年前在北京吉祥戏院看曲周萧素卿演“三拂袖”，觉得好听好看而情节有趣，从此看上了河南梆子。到后来才知道这出戏是一位樊先生编的。去年马金凤和阎立品告诉我，河南曾经批评过人民最爱看的“樊戏”，批评得他们不敢演了。这次到西安，我特地拜访了狮吼剧团的樊粹庭先生，参观了他们的新生部，在两个大芦篷的民乐园中，在拥挤的长椅上看了娃娃戏，真高兴。但比我更高兴的，是排立在两廊买站票的朋友们，他们是真正的豫剧的欣赏者和拥护者。
    樊戏的作者，二十五年前从大学里出来，弃官从戏，和家庭断绝了，在社会上成为一个 “戏班子的人”。遭受贫困、污辱，他还是坚持教娃娃戏，自己“写”了几十个豫剧。这些新本子，包括名演员陈素贞所演的“叶含嫣”，都是未曾印行的，但所有河南梆子的剧团都演唱，在农村中很受欢迎。他在排戏以前，先把故事和人物个性和演员谈，让他们自己想怎么唱怎么做，然后才写。在排演中，特别注意“内心的表情”，注意武功的锻炼。他请了京戏中的名师（现在是徐碧云）给演员说戏。樊戏的唱词都是通俗的，一听就懂；为了满足观众的情绪，常常变悲剧为喜剧。这种作法如何，可以暂且勿论，但他的戏之所以为人民所爱看，是他为观众写戏。在过去和现在，樊戏做到了“是老百姓爱看的戏”的目的。这中间不免有些旧日的情调，但我看了许多出，并没有什么毒素。我看了据说是有问题的“汉江女”，不过是士宦之家和“贫女”相爱的故事，我很注意的看它是否有毒，只觉好而未见其问题所在。
    在抗战期间，这个戏班受到大折磨，退到西安南关的“贫民窟”内存身，三面粪厂，在一空场上由几个癞头娃娃演戏。现在好了，他们有了自己的民乐园，有了宿舍，分大小两队演出，去年一年在乡村演出了一百七十多次。他们最近作了一次旅行演出，也要到北京争鸣一下。他们没有带来什么名角，都是这些久经锻炼的长大了的娃娃，有一些做功，有一些跟头，更有继续发展为最好演员的希望。他们带了两出新的樊戏——王佐断臂和劈山救母。这两出戏在西北上演受到欢迎，天津的朋友已经写信来说演出的盛况。在北京也一定会得到掌声的。
    我在西安受到狮吼新生部孩子们的嘱托，要我回京介绍他们的老师樊粹庭和常警惕，我不能辜负这些孩子们的希望。这几年中，我对于樊先生在豫剧创作、导演和培养第二代有很大的敬意，他的经验和成就应该值得戏剧界的重视。我一向以为，作为全中国、作为华北官话区域中心的北京，应该有一个豫剧院。今年来了崔兰田，还有要来的。让我们在豫剧中多看出一些优良的传统，多看一看华北许多老百姓爱看的戏。我慎重地介绍樊戏和它的作者，相信像我介绍曲剧杨乃武小白菜一样，不会使观众们落空的。
