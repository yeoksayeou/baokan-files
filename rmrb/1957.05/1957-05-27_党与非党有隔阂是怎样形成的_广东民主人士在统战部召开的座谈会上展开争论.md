Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, May 25th. At a symposium convened by the United Front Work Department of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on the 23rd, many democratic figures expressed different opinions on how to correctly assess some shortcomings in the relationship between Party members and non-Party members.
    Li Langru, Vice Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) and a non-Party democratic figure, said, "Over the past thirty years, I have come into contact with many Communist Party members, and I also have many old friends who are Party members. In recent years, I have deeply felt that many veteran Party members with high positions have good self-cultivation, good attitudes, and good relations with the masses. Although there are some who are not good enough, we cannot regard the bad behavior of a few individuals as representative of the entire Communist Party. Some newly admitted comrades who have just 'become full members' are arrogant and cocky. The Party should see that these comrades with short Party membership and low positions have more shortcomings."
    Peng Guangqin, Deputy Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Guangzhou Branch of the Jiusan Society, believes that the Party's United Front work is basically well done, but judging from the problems reflected, it should be said that it is still not done well enough. He said that the Party's policies are correct, but they are not well implemented because the level of Party cadres is low, it is precisely a case of "good scriptures being chanted badly by a crooked-mouthed monk." He said that the implementation of policies is better in Beijing, worse in local areas, and even worse in counties and districts. He also agreed with Li Langru's view of the Party. He said that he came into contact with a cadre who had participated in the Long March, and although his cultural level was lower, his attitude and work style were very good. Some new Party members and those with shorter Party membership are not as good. Peng Guangqin also believes that the Party Central Committee regards the democratic parties as fingers of a hand, each of which plays a role; at the local level, Comrade Rao Zhangfeng (Director of the United Front Work Department of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party) may see them as eyebrows, dispensable, but better to have than not; further down to the county and district level, they are not seen as eyebrows, but as beards, dispensable, and best if they are not there.
    Mo Xiong, a non-Party person and Deputy Director of the Guangdong Provincial Office of Counselors, also said in his speech, "I think the relationship between the Party and non-Party members is generally good. This is my personal and profound experience of more than twenty years. I have always believed that if the relationship between the Party and non-Party members had not been consistently good, the Chinese revolution could not have been victorious, and today's socialist construction could not have achieved such success. However, this does not mean that the relationship between every Party member and non-Party person is good, especially some Party members who lack struggle experience. Their level of Marxism is too low, and they have not received enough Party education. They even use the glorious title of Party member to intimidate others, and even violate the Party's mass line, being aloof and looking down on everything. In this way, people see a high wall built between the Party and non-Party members on them."
    However, Zhang Boquan, Vice Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the CPPCC and a non-Party democratic figure, and Zhong Ping, Director of the Organization Department of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, both disagreed with the assessment of "the higher levels are good, the lower levels are not good" and placing the responsibility for the poor relationship between the Party and non-Party members entirely on the lower levels. Zhang Boquan said that it is not appropriate to push all the bad things to the lower levels, because this involves the issue of education for the lower levels. In recent years, there are still many people who do not understand the United Front policy. Therefore, the most fundamental problem is that cadres are not sufficiently educated. On the other hand, cadres at the lower levels have a simplistic task-oriented view and do not study enough. Zhong Ping also said that the key problem lies with the leadership. If the relationship between the Party and the masses is not good, and the United Front policy cannot be well implemented, it is not just a problem of the United Front Work Department. The Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party is responsible. For example, the issue of the democratic parties needing to be linked with the Propaganda Department and the Cultural and Education Department of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has not been resolved for a long time. Also, the issue of the staffing of the democratic parties has been resolved by the central government, but Guangdong has not yet been able to resolve it. This is a question of how the provincial leadership views the democratic parties.

### 党与非党有隔阂是怎样形成的  广东民主人士在统战部召开的座谈会上展开争论

    党与非党有隔阂是怎样形成的
    广东民主人士在统战部召开的座谈会上展开争论
    本报特约新华社广州25日电  在中共广东省委会统战部23日召集的座谈会上，许多民主人士就如何正确估计党与非党关系上的一些缺点，发表了不同意见。
    政协广东省委员会副主席、无党派民主人士李朗如说，“我三十年来接触过不少共产党员，也有许多党员的老朋友。这几年里我深深感觉到许多党龄长、地位较高的党员同志，修养好、态度好、党群关系也好。其中虽然也有不够好的，但不能把少数个别人的不好表现，看成是整个共产党都这样。有一些新入党刚刚‘转正’的同志，气焰嚣张，趾高气扬，党应该看到这一些党龄短、地位较低的同志是有较多缺点的。”
    九三学社广州分社筹备委员会副主任委员彭光钦认为，党的统战工作基本上是做得好的，但从反映出来的问题来看，则应当说还做得很不够。他说，党的方针、政策是正确的，但贯彻得不好，原因是党员干部水平低，正是“经是好、歪嘴和尚念坏了。”他说，贯彻政策，北京较好，地方差一些，到县区就更差一些。他也同意李朗如对党的看法。他说，他接触到一个曾参加长征的干部，尽管他文化水平低一些，但态度、作风都非常好。一些新党员和党龄较短的就差一些。彭光钦还认为，党中央是把民主党派看作人的手指的，手指每一个都起作用；到地方上，饶彰风同志（中共广东省委统战部部长）可能看成是眉毛，可有可无，但有比无好；再下去到县、区就不是看成眉毛，而看成是胡子，可有可无，最好是没有。
    无党派人士、省参事室副主任莫雄在发言时也说，我认为党与非党的关系，一般说来是好的。这是我二十多年来亲身的深刻体验。我始终认为，如果党与非党的关系一贯搞不好，中国革命就不可能获得胜利，今天的社会主义建设事业也不可能获得这样成就。但是，这并不是说每个党员和党外人士的关系都搞得好，特别是一些缺乏斗争锻炼的党员。他们马克思主义的水平太低，接受党的教育也不够，竟用党员的光荣称号去吓唬别人，甚至是违反了党的群众路线，高高在上，傲视一切。这样，人们就在他们的身上看到党与非党之间筑成一道高墙。
    但是，政协广东省委员会副主席无党派民主人士张?村和民盟广东省委组织部长钟平，都不同意“上级好、下级不好”、把党和非党员关系不好的责任都往下推的估计。张?村说，把不好都推到下级也不恰当，因为这牵涉到对下级的教育问题。这几年来还有不少人不懂统战政策，因此，最基本的问题是对干部教育不够。另一方面是下边干部存在单纯任务观点，学习不够。钟平也说，关键问题在于领导，党群关系不好，统战政策不能很好贯彻，不仅是统战部的问题，中共广东省委员会是要负责的。像民主党派要同中共广东省委宣传部、文教部挂钩的问题，就很久没有解决。又如民主党派的编制问题，中央已经解决了，但是广东现在还得不到解决，这是省领导上如何看待民主党派的问题。
