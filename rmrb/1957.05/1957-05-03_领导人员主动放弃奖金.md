    Leading Personnel Voluntarily Forgo Bonuses

    (Xinhua News Agency) In Shanghai factories under the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry and the Ministry of Electrical Machinery Manufacturing Industry, many factory directors and CCP committee secretaries have voluntarily given up receiving bonuses this year.

    The four factory directors and deputy factory directors, and the two Party committee secretaries of the state-owned Shanghai Machine Tool Plant have not received bonuses since the fourth quarter of last year. The factory director and Party committee secretary of Shanghai Electric Motor Factory voluntarily gave up bonuses as early as September last year. The factory director and Party committee secretary of Shanghai Turbine Factory also recently decided not to receive bonuses for the first quarter of this year. Leading personnel in many other factories have taken similar actions.

    At the beginning of this year, leading personnel in various factories discussed the resolutions of the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the CCP, and many people expressed that they should take the lead in promoting the spirit of hard work and plain living, share weal and woe with the workers and masses, and should not have too large a gap in personal income with the workers and masses. Leading personnel in enterprises such as Shanghai Turbine Factory believe that there are still many workers in the factory who have difficulties in life, and their own wages are already relatively high, so taking many bonuses would affect unity. The three department heads of the CCP Committee of this factory, as well as the chairman of the trade union, the secretary of the Communist Youth League, and other leading cadres, have recently decided to give up receiving bonuses for the first quarter and subsequent quarters.

    领导人员主动放弃奖金
    据新华社讯  第一机械工业部和电机制造工业部所属的上海各厂中，许多厂长和中共党委书记今年已主动放弃领取奖金。
    国营上海机床厂的四个正副厂长和两个党委书记，从去年第四季度起，没有领取奖金。上海电机厂的厂长、党委书记等，早在去年9月起就自动放弃了奖金。上海汽轮机厂厂长、党委书记，最近也决定不领今年第一季度的奖金。其他不少厂的领导人员也采取了同样的行动。
    今年年初，各厂领导人员讨论了中共中央二中全会的决议，许多人表示应该带头发扬艰苦朴素精神，跟职工群众同甘共苦，不应在个人所得方面同职工群众悬殊过大。上海汽轮机厂等企业的领导人员认为，目前工厂中生活困难的职工还不少，自己的工资本来就比较高，再拿许多奖金，会影响团结。这个厂的中共党委会三个部长和工会主席、团委书记等领导干部，最近也决定放弃领取第一季度的和以后的奖金。
