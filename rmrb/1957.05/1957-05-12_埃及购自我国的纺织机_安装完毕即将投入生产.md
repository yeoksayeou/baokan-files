    Egyptian Textile Machines Purchased from China Installed and Ready for Production
    (Dispatch from our newspaper in Cairo) Two hundred looms and ten spinning frames manufactured in China have been installed at the Shiba Textile Factory in Alexandria, Egypt, and some have already begun trial operation. This batch of machines was manufactured by the Shanghai "China Textile Machinery Factory."
    The Shiba factory ranks fourth among Egyptian cotton textile factories, with 60,000 spindles and 4,000 employees. Previously, the factory had been operating textile machines from Europe, the United States, and Japan. This is the first time an Egyptian factory has used Chinese textile machines.
    The process of ordering this batch of Chinese machines was as follows: After the Bandung Conference in 1955, Mr. Shiba, the general manager of the factory, was invited to visit China. At the "China State-owned No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory" in Beijing, he saw that all the machines there were made in China and found that the machines were very efficient. Later, he visited the manufacturing process at the Shanghai "China Textile Machinery Factory" and observed each machine and each important part on site. After he returned to his country, upon his recommendation, the board of directors of the Shiba factory decided to order this batch of textile machines from China.
    Two months ago, at the invitation of the Shiba factory, Chinese engineer Chen Renqi led two technicians to Egypt to help Egyptian workers install these machines. Throughout the entire work process, they cooperated very well with the Egyptian workers. Under the guidance of Engineer Chen, technicians Wang Jikai and Cui Xiaocheng, almost every day covered in oil and sweat on their foreheads, enthusiastically worked with the Egyptian workers to install the machines. Although they could not communicate directly with the Egyptian workers due to language barriers, they always felt the friendly feelings that the Egyptian workers showed them.
    Now, through the joint efforts of Chinese technicians and Egyptian workers, this batch of Chinese-made textile machines will soon be put into full production, spinning fine yarn and weaving fine cloth for the Egyptian people.
    According to Mr. Shiba, the general manager of the Egyptian factory, he will visit China again soon. He said that this visit to China is on the one hand to promote his factory's products, and on the other hand to prepare to order more textile machines from China.

### 埃及购自我国的纺织机  安装完毕即将投入生产

    埃及购自我国的纺织机  安装完毕即将投入生产
    本报开罗航讯　我国制造的二百台织布机和十台细纱机，已经在埃及亚历山大港的司巴海纺织工厂安装完毕，其中有一部分并已开始试工。这一批机器是由上海“中国纺织机械厂”制造的。
    司巴海工厂的规模在埃及棉纺织厂中占第四位，有六万个纱锭，全部职工四千人。在这以前，在这个厂里开动着的都是来自欧美各国和日本的纺织机。埃及的工厂使用中国的纺织机，这还是第一次。
    这批中国机器的订购过程是这样的：1955年万隆会议以后，这家工厂的总经理司巴海应邀到中国访问参观，在北京“中国国营第二棉纺织厂”看到那里的全部机器都是中国自制的，并且发现机器的效能都十分良好；后来他又在上海“中国纺织机械厂”参观了机器的制造过程，实地观察了每一台机器和每个重要零件。在他回国以后，经过他的推荐，司巴海工厂的董事会便决定向中国订购了这一批纺织机。
    在两个月以前，应司巴海工厂的邀请，我国工程师陈人骐率领了二名技术员到埃及帮助埃及工人安装这些机器。在整个工作过程中，他们和埃及的工人们合作得很好。在陈工程师的指导之下，技术员王集恺和崔孝诚差不多每天都满手油泥，额上挂着汗珠，满怀热情地同埃及工人一起把机器安装起来。虽然由于言语不通，他们和埃及工人不能直接交谈，但他们随时都感受到埃及工人对他们所表现的友好的感情。
    现在，经过中国技术人员和埃及工人的共同努力，这一批中国制造的纺织机器即将全部投入生产，为埃及人民纺出细纱，织出细布。
    据这家埃及工厂的总经理司巴海先生告诉中国记者说，不久，他将要再一次访问中国。他说，这一次访问中国，一方面是为了推销他的工厂的产品，一方面则是准备再从中国订购一些纺织机。
