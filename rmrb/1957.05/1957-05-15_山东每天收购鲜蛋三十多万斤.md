    Shandong Province Purchases More Than 300,000 Jin of Fresh Eggs Daily

    Since April, Shandong Province has been able to purchase 350,000 jin of fresh eggs daily, with a total of 7.65 million jin purchased throughout the month, compared to only 4.57 million jin during the same period last year. It is estimated that at least 50 million jin of fresh eggs can be purchased this year. In addition to meeting the needs of the province, these eggs will also be transported to Tianjin, the Northeast, and other regions.

    The good results in egg procurement in Shandong Province this year are mainly due to the adoption of methods that facilitate farmers. For example, procurement departments are directly linked to agricultural cooperatives, allowing farmers to sell eggs to the agricultural cooperatives in small quantities, which are then sold to the state in a unified manner. Procurement departments also organize rural retail outlets selling cigarettes, alcohol, and meat to collect eggs. In addition, small vendors are organized to collect eggs from village to village. These methods have been welcomed by farmers.

    山东每天收购鲜蛋三十多万斤
    4月份以来，山东省每天可以收购鲜蛋三十五万斤，全月收购了七百六十五万斤，而去年同期只收了四百五十七万斤。预计今年至少可以收购鲜蛋五千万斤以上。这些蛋除供应本省需要外，还将运往天津、东北等地。
    山东省今年鸡蛋收购成绩好，主要是因为采取了便利农民的收购方法。如收购部门和农业社直接挂钩，农民可以零星地卖给农业社，再统一交售国家；收购部门还组织农村的烟、酒、肉等零售点收蛋，此外，还组织小商小贩串村收购。这些办法受到农民的欢迎。
