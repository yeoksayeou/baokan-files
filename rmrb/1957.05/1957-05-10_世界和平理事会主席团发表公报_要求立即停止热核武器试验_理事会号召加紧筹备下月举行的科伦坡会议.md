The communiqué pointed out that the people of all countries are striving to break free from the dangers of the Cold War and the threat of atomic war. The public hopes for new progress on the path of negotiation, and they yearn for fair and acceptable resolutions that can be reached to safeguard the interests and independence of all countries. All these issues will be the subject of extensive and free discussion at the Colombo Conference.

The communiqué concluded by saying that the agenda of the conference will be decided by the World Peace Council itself in Colombo.
