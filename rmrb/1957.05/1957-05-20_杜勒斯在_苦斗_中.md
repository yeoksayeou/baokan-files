	Dulles in "Struggle"
		The Disadvantage of Too Many "Reasons"
    If one person has an argument with another, is the person with more reasons at an advantage, or the person with fewer reasons? This question is, of course, not difficult to answer. However, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles has a different view: he believes that the more reasons one has, the more unlucky one is, because too many reasons will lead to "contradictions"!

    Recently, in order to defend the U.S. State Department's ban on American journalists visiting China, Dulles put forward a whole bunch of "reasons." In a letter to "New York Times" publisher Sulzberger, he said: "If time permits, I could list twenty reasons here, and these reasons are gradually increasing...". But, strangely enough, the more Dulles's "reasons" gradually increase, the more embarrassed he becomes. The American press accuses him of putting forward "reasons" that are increasingly "lacking in basis" and self-contradictory. Thus, Dulles felt that a certain place on his body was really painfully unbearable, and couldn't help but cry out. At a press conference on May 14, Dulles said: "When I talk about this issue, people often say that I am contradictory, because there are too many reasons. If I don't say all the reasons at once, they say I am always changing my reasons."

    Well said! But what to do? If having too many reasons causes contradictions, then shouldn't one shut up quickly? But no! Dulles still kept babbling and put forward more reasons, thus creating more contradictions. It seems he is determined to "struggle" in this vicious circle of self-contradiction.
    The Twenty-First Reason: The "Freedom" to Publish Blank Newspapers

    Recently, Dulles had a flash of inspiration and came up with another reason. He said that prohibiting American journalists from visiting China does not deprive them of the right to freedom of the press, because the "freedom of the press" mentioned in the U.S. Constitution refers to publication, not interviewing. Due to "policy" and other reasons, interviews cannot be free in the first place, so it is legal for the State Department not to issue passports to American journalists.

    However, this reason did not help Dulles get up from the ground. The "New York Times" editorial immediately retorted: "If journalists are arbitrarily restricted from getting news opportunities as they are now, then the right to publish is completely interfered with to the same extent. Does Mr. Dulles have to say that the freedom to publish a blank newspaper is 'freedom of the press'?" At a recent press conference, someone also questioned Dulles: "Mr. Secretary of State, if you can control the sources of news, what value does the right to publish have...Isn't this a typical way to stop the publication of news?"

    So the twenty-first reason is over again. Dulles quickly explained: "No, I wouldn't say that." – Sure enough: adding a reason adds another "contradiction."

   "All Americans" Must Be Tools of Foreign Policy

    Dulles had to continue looking for reasons. He thought: beating around the bush will never convince people, so it is better to rush through directly. He announced to the American press: in a thousand words, ten thousand words, anyway, American foreign policy is above everything else, "American foreign policy will inevitably make the American people have to accept certain restrictions." Therefore, Dulles simply openly asked American journalists to sacrifice their own freedom of rights and "act" under the "guidance" of foreign policy. It should be said more correctly, that is, "not act" under the "guidance" of foreign policy!

    At a press conference on May 14, someone asked Dulles: "Sir, does your policy mean that journalists, American journalists, should become a tool of American foreign policy, is that so?" Dulles replied: "No, because our policy applies not only to American journalists, but to all Americans." All Americans must be tools of foreign policy, and American journalists are of course no exception. This is the real reason why Dulles banned American journalists from visiting China.

    Does Policy Determine People, or Do People Determine Policy?

    It is precisely because of the foreign policy that the United States is now pursuing that many freedoms of the American people are being deprived.

    American playwright Arthur Miller recently accused the State Department at the National Congress of the American Writers Union, saying that it "interferes with the circulation of American books abroad, and interferes with American music and American paintings. At present, it is no longer news that American scientists cannot hold various international scientific conferences in the United States because many foreign scientists are not allowed to come to the United States. I think that if we agree with the view that high policy alone is the most sacred, and any other value can be sacrificed for it at will, then we must give up our independence as writers and citizens."

    The American public can also raise the question: should policy determine people, or should people determine policy? Why can't foreign policy serve Americans, and must 170 million Americans serve Dulles's foreign policy? It can be seen that Dulles's policy does not represent the American citizens. In fact, it only represents the will of a small group of stubborn monopoly capital groups, and sacrifices the interests and rights of the vast American public. Why is Dulles always "contradictory"? It is because he wants to do his best to serve the monopoly capital groups, but he also wants to cover up this fact.

    Unwavering? - "I don't know."

    But is Dulles's ban on journalists visiting China really never wavering? Strangely, even Dulles himself dared not say for sure. He said at a press conference: "As for whether you want to call it unwavering, I don't know." It is said that Dulles has now indicated that he may be "willing to allow some American journalists to travel under a restricted policy." So, on the one hand, he firmly opposes going, and on the other hand, he cannot firmly oppose going. Isn't this another "contradiction"? But Dulles replied: "You know, in life, sometimes everything you do cannot be absolutely logical.... I admit that this is not entirely logical, but in some cases, in order to reach a certain degree of compromise, one cannot take pure logic into account." Good way, Dulles finally found a theoretical basis for his "contradictions," and foreshadowed the "contradictions" that will continue to appear in the future. It seems that Dulles does not intend to "struggle" forever. But when will the struggle end? Since Dulles himself doesn't know, people shouldn't rush to a conclusion.

### 杜勒斯在“苦斗”中

    杜勒斯在“苦斗”中	崔奇
       “理由”太多的坏处
    如果一个人同另一个人发生了争论，那么是理由多的人有利呢，还是理由少的人有利？这个问题当然是不难回答的。但是，美国国务卿杜勒斯却有一种与众不同的见解：他认为，谁的理由越多，谁就越倒霉，因为理由太多了，就会“前后矛盾”！
    近来，为了替美国国务院禁止美国记者访华的事情进行辩护，杜勒斯提出了一大堆“理由”。他在给“纽约时报”发行人苏兹贝格的信中说：“如果时间许可的话，我可以在这里举出二十种理由来，而这些理由还在逐渐增多……。可是，说来也奇怪，杜勒斯的“理由”越是逐渐增多，他就越是弄得狼狈不堪。美国新闻界指责他所提出的“理由”是一次比一次更“缺少根据”，而且自相矛盾。于是，杜勒斯感到他的身上有个地方实在痛得难挨，不禁叫喊起来了。在5月14日的记者招待会上，杜勒斯说：“在我谈到这个问题的时候，有人常常说我前后矛盾，因为理由是太多了，如果我没有一下子把所有理由都说出来，他们就说我老是改变理由。”
    说得真是精彩！可是，怎么办呢？如果因为理由太多才造成前后矛盾，那么岂不应该赶快闭口为妙。然而不！杜勒斯还是喋喋不休地提出了更多的理由，于是，又造成更多的前后矛盾。看来，他是决心在这种恶性循环的自我矛盾中“苦斗”下去了。第二十一个理由：出版空白报纸的“自由”
    最近，杜勒斯灵机一动，又想出了一个理由。他说，禁止美国记者访问中国，并没有剥夺新闻自由的权利，因为美国宪法上讲的“新闻自由”指的是出版，而不是采访。由于“政策”等等原因，采访本来就不能是自由的，因此国务院不发给美国记者护照是合法的。
    但是，这个理由并没有使杜勒斯从地上爬起来。“纽约时报”的社论立即反驳说：“如果像现在这样任意限制记者得到新闻的机会，那么出版权利完全在同样程度上受到了干涉。难道杜勒斯先生一定要说出版一张空白的报纸的自由才是‘新闻自由，吗？”在最近的记者招待会上，也有人指问杜勒斯：“国务卿先生，如果你能控制新闻来源，那出版权还有什么价值……这难道不是停止新闻出版的典型的办法吗？”
    于是第二十一个理由又完了。杜勒斯赶紧解释说：“不，我不会说是这样的。”——果然如此：增加一个理由，就又增加了一个“前后矛盾”。
   “一切美国人”都要做外交政策的工具
    杜勒斯不得不继续寻找理由。他想：转弯抹角总是说服不了人，那么还不如直截了当地闯过去。他向美国新闻界宣布说：千句话，万句话，反正美国外交政策高于一切，“美国外交政策必然会使得美国人民要接受一定的限制”。因此，杜勒斯索性公开要求美国记者牺牲自己的自由权利，在外交政策的“引导”下而“活动”。应该更正确地说，就是在外交政策的“引导”下而“不活动”！
    在5月14日的记者招待会上，有人问杜勒斯：“先生，你的政策等于要使记者、美国的记者成为美国外交政策的一种工具，是这样的吗？”杜勒斯回答说：“不，因为我们的政策不仅适用于美国记者，而是适用于一切美国人。”一切美国人都要做外交政策的工具，美国记者当然也不能例外。这就是杜勒斯禁止美国记者访华的真正理由。
    政策决定人，还是人决定政策？
    正是由于美国现在所执行的这种外交政策，美国人的许多自由权利被剥夺了。
    美国剧作家阿瑟·米勒最近在美国作家联盟全国大会上指责国务院说，它“干涉美国书籍在国外的流通，干涉美国的音乐和美国的绘画。在目前，由于不许很多外国科学家到美国来，美国的科学家不能在美国国内召开各种国际科学代表大会，这件事已不是什么新闻了。我认为，如果我们同意这种看法，认为单是高级政策是最神圣的，而任何其他价值可以随便为它牺牲掉，那么，我们就得放弃我们作为作家和公民的独立性。”
    美国公众还可以提出这样的问题：究竟应该是政策决定人，还是人决定政策？为什么外交政策不可以为美国人服务，而必须是一亿七千多万美国人为杜勒斯的外交政策服务呢？由此可见，杜勒斯的政策并不是代表美国公民的。实际上它只代表一小群顽固的垄断资本集团的意旨，而牺牲美国广大公众的利益和权利。杜勒斯为什么总是“前后矛盾”呢？就是因为他既要竭力为垄断资本集团服务，却又想掩盖这个事实。
    毫不动摇吗？——“我却不知道了。”
    但是，杜勒斯关于记者访华的禁令真是永远也不动摇吗？奇怪的是连杜勒斯自己也不敢说一定。他在记者招待会上说：“至于你们要不要把它说成毫不动摇这一点，我却不知道了。”据说现在杜勒斯已经表示可能“愿意允许一些美国新闻记者在一项受限制的政策下前往”。于是，一方面，坚决反对去，另一方面，又不能坚决反对去，这不又是“前后矛盾”吗？但是，杜勒斯回答说：“你知道，在生活中，有的时候你所做的每一件事情不可能都是绝对地合乎逻辑的。……我承认这并不完全合乎逻辑，但是在有些情况中，为了达成一定程度的妥协，就不能顾纯粹的逻辑了。”好办法，杜勒斯总算给他的“前后矛盾”找到了理论根据，并为他今后还要不断出现的“前后矛盾”写下了伏笔。看来，杜勒斯也并不打算永远“苦斗”下去的。可是究竟斗到何时为止呢？既然杜勒斯自己都不知道，人们还是不忙于下结论吧。
