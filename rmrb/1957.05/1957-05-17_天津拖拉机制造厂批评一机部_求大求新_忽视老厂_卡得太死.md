Xinhua News Agency reporter Meng Fan reports: Liu Shuying, director of the Tianjin Tractor Factory, believes that the rectification campaign in the First Ministry of Machine Building should include a serious review of the implementation of the policy of fully utilizing existing enterprises. He said: From 1953 to 1955, the ministry excessively emphasized the significance of key projects, pursuing large scale and modernization, while neglecting the role of old factories. Under the slogan of guaranteeing key construction projects (of course, some appropriate development is necessary), on the one hand, old factories were squeezed dry with no investment and very little funding for technical measures, preventing them from fully发挥作用; on the other hand, the construction of new factories was indeed guaranteed, but there was also a lot of waste. Since last year, the state has paid attention to this problem. However, the policy of fully utilizing existing enterprises has not been well implemented in the First Ministry of Machine Building.

The ministry has focused its main energy on the construction of key projects, and put very little effort into arranging the production of old factories. When deciding on the production direction of a factory, too much thought is given in the office and too little in-depth investigation and research is done, and the opinions of the factories are not adequately listened to. The ministry also gives too little power to the factories, without a certain degree of flexibility. Doesn't this turn them into "dead factories"?

The issue of decentralizing power was raised at the end of 1955, but the ministry has not finalized anything to this day. However, judging from some things, responsibility has been devolved first, making it difficult for enterprises. For example, in terms of finance, this year factories are called on to be independent and autonomous, and technical measure funds are not provided, and the small loan methods have not been issued, but the profit sharing to be turned over is only given to the factory at the end of the year. How can the factory achieve financial autonomy in this way? It is said that in this matter, the First Ministry of Machine Building was considerate of the difficulties of the factory and made suggestions to the State Council, but the Ministry of Finance did not agree.

### 天津拖拉机制造厂批评一机部  求大求新　忽视老厂　卡得太死

    天津拖拉机制造厂批评一机部
    求大求新　忽视老厂　卡得太死
    本报特约专稿　新华社记者孟帆报道：天津拖拉机制造厂厂长刘树英认为，第一机械工业部的整风应该把执行充分利用旧有企业的方针做一次认真的检查。他说：在1953年到1955年间，部里过分地强调了重点工程的意义，追求大规模、现代化，而忽视了发挥老厂的作用。在保证重点建设的口号下（当然适当的搞也是必要的），一方面老厂被挤得干巴巴的没有一点投资，要技术措施费用也很少，不能充分发挥作用；另一方面新厂的建设确实保证了，可是浪费也不少。从去年起，国家已经重视了这个问题。但是充分利用旧有企业方针在第一机械工业部并没有得到很好的贯彻。
    部里把主要精力都放在重点工程的建设上，对老厂生产的安排下功夫就很少了。决定一个工厂的生产方向的时候，在办公室里想的太多，深入调查研究太少，也没有很好的注意听取工厂的意见。部里给工厂的权利也太小，没有一定的机动余地，这岂不成了“死工厂”？
    关于权力下放的问题，1955年底就提出来了，到现在部里什么也没定下来。可是从一些事情看，责任倒先放下来了，使企业感到为难。例如财务方面，今年叫工厂独立自主，技术措施费不给了，小额贷款办法也没下来，可是上缴利润提成到年底才给工厂，这样工厂怎能实现财务自主呢？据说，在这个问题上，第一机械工业部还是体谅工厂困难的，曾向国务院提出了意见，但是财政部不同意。
