    Shortcomings in Beijing's Commercial Sector Work
    Unclear Inventory, Bureaucratic Air
    There are many unreasonable phenomena in the supply work of Beijing's commercial departments.

    Some units have unclear inventories, leading to stockouts in stores while goods are piling up in warehouses. For example, sodium-based grease, which has been out of stock for a long time at the Petroleum Company, was recently found to have more than four tons in storage. The medicinal materials company had shortages of Jiu Chang Pu and Yu Shu in the stores, but the production department had several hundred kilograms in stock. Some stores don't have a full variety of goods not because they are out of stock, but because they are not displayed. For example, the Xidan Department Store had 261 kinds of sundresses and skirts, but only 139 kinds were displayed in the store. The textile company's light-colored floral cloth could have met market demand, except for seersucker, but because the company was conservative and reluctant to release it to the market early, it affected the timely supply to the stores and the timely arrangement of summer clothing.
    
    Bureaucratic air is strong. The Jiaotong Electrical and Telecommunications Equipment Company's Jiaotong Store has a very incomplete range of products, and many odd items are left in the warehouse. As a result, customers have to go to the Guang'anmenwai warehouse to pick up even a small one- or two-ounce car piston. The demand for thin-gauge civilian lead wire is high, but the hardware company supplies only 31% thin-gauge lead wire, with the remaining 69% being thick-gauge. This company supplies the Shilibu branch of the supply and marketing cooperative with hinges but does not supply the screws for the hinges. Consumers have to go to the city to buy screws. Four screws are only worth three cents, but the round-trip fare to the city costs 26 cents.

    The phenomenon of bundling is everywhere. The textile company requires production cooperatives to take dark-colored floral cloth when supplying light-colored floral cloth. The watch and glasses company requires stores to take other goods along with watches, and the electrical appliance company requires other goods to be sold along with radios. Citizens who buy hemp fiber from the trading company must also buy lime, otherwise it will not be sold.

    Public-private partnership stores generally prefer to operate large-volume products and are unwilling to supply the odd items needed by residents. Some small hardware stores no longer deal in civilian hardware and are selling large boilers. The Sanyou Industrial Cooperative used to mainly deal in bedding (sheets, towels, pillowcases, etc.), but now these varieties have been reduced, and most of them have shifted to operating clothing. Some civilian hardware (such as lead wire, iron nails, window screens, etc.) supplied to public-private partnership stores are not sold in small quantities to residents, but are sold in batches to government agencies and enterprises.

    The Beijing Municipal People's Committee Commercial Bureau has inspected these situations and will take effective measures to correct the shortcomings in the supply work.

### 北京商业部门工作中的缺点  家底不清　官气十足

    北京商业部门工作中的缺点
    家底不清　官气十足
    北京市商业部门的供应工作中存在许多不合理的现象。
    有些单位家底不清，以致仓库有货，门市却脱销。如石油公司长期脱销的钠基脂，最近在仓库里发现还压着四吨多；药材公司的九昌葡、于术等药材门市脱销，可是在生产部却存着几百斤。有些商店的货物品种不全并不是没有货，而是没有摆出来。如百货公司西单商场有布拉吉、裙子等二百六十一种，门市只摆出一百三十九种。纺织品公司的浅花布除泡泡纱以外，本来可以满足市场供应，但由于该公司保守惜售，不愿意早些向市场投放，影响了门市的及时供应和夏季服装的及时安排。
    官气十足。交通电工器材公司所属交通商店品种很不齐全，很多零星商品都在仓库搁着，以致顾客买一个一两重的汽车活塞也要亲自到广安门外仓库去取货。民用铅丝需要细号的多，可是五金公司供应的细号铅丝仅占31％，其余69％都是粗号的。这个公司供应供销合作社十里堡门市部合页，但不供应合页上用的螺丝，消费者只好到城里去买螺丝，四个螺丝只值三分钱，而进一趟城的车费就要二角六分。
    搭配现象到处都有。纺织品公司供应生产合作社的浅花布要搭深花布；钟表眼镜公司供应商店的手表，交电公司供应的收音机也要搭配其他商品才出售。市民向贸易公司买麻刀必须同时买石灰，否则就不卖给。
    公私合营商店普遍存在愿意经营大品种，不愿意供应居民所需要的零星商品。有的小五金店不经营民用五金，卖起大锅炉来了；三友实业社原来主要经营床上用品（床单、毛巾被、枕套等），现在这些品种减少了，大部转向经营服装。供应给公私合营商店的一些民用五金（如铅丝、铁钉、窗纱等），有的合营商店没有零星供应给居民，都成批地卖给机关企业了。
    北京市人民委员会商业局已经检查了这些情况，并将采取有效措施，纠正供应工作中的缺点。
