    Beautifying Life
    Men Yurong, Student of Baoding Girls' Middle School, Hebei

    After reading the People's Daily's editorial "On the Issue of Middle and High School Graduates Participating in Agricultural Production," I deeply felt the Party's meticulous care for our younger generation. Now, I realize that whether I go on to further education or participate in production, both offer a bright and great future.

    My father is a member of a sewing cooperative. After graduating from high school, if I don't get into university, I am determined to be a strong helper to my father. However, some classmates think this work is both monotonous and boring; others think this work is too ordinary and has no future. I don't agree with their views. Think about it, who among us doesn't wear clothes? And whose clothes aren't made by sewing workers? This industry is indispensable in society. I want to use my heart to make a variety of styles of clothing to beautify our lives. Is this kind of work monotonous and boring? Does it have no future? Isn't it honorable to be a Chinese handicraft worker with culture?

    Once I become a sewing worker, I will study sewing techniques diligently, overcome all difficulties, and strive to become an excellent sewing worker in the future. I think that brave sailors cannot be trained in a calm ocean. We should accept the tests that life gives us and bravely meet life.

    美化生活
    河北保定女中学生　门玉荣
    当我看到人民日报发表“关于中小学毕业生参加农业生产问题”的社论后，深深地感觉到国家对我们青年一代无微不至的关怀。现在，我认识到不论是升学还是参加生产，都有光明伟大的前途。
    我的父亲是一个缝纫合作社社员。高中毕业后，如果考不上大学，我决心做父亲的一个有力助手。可是有的同学认为这个工作，既单调又无味；也有的人认为这个工作太平凡，没有什么前途。我可不同意他们的看法。大家想想看，我们哪一个人不穿衣服？哪一个人穿的衣服不是缝纫工人做的呢？这一个行业在社会上是不能缺少的。我要用心制作出多种式样的衣服来，美化我们的生活。难道这种工作是单调无味吗？难道说没有什么前途吗？难道做一个中国有文化的手工业者不光荣吗？
    一旦我当了缝纫工人，我就好好地学习缝纫技术，克服一切困难，争取将来成为一个优秀的缝纫工人。我想，在平静的海洋里，锻炼不出勇敢的水手。我们应该接受生活给我们的考验，勇敢地去迎接生活。
