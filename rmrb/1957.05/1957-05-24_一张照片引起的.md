Title: Caused by a Photograph

Some people oppose satire, allegedly because satire often involves exaggeration.

	"Is real life really like this?" "Do such things really happen in life?" The implication is that satire is nothing more than a distortion of real life and should be banned.

	However, there is also satire that does not involve exaggeration—as straightforward as one plus one equals two. Surely this kind of satire should not be opposed. But that's not the case. I have a copy of the "Liberation Daily" from April 26th, which, in the "Party Life" column, published a small incident:

	“This is a daily phenomenon at the Shanghai Wire Factory: as soon as the quitting time bell rings, a portion of the workers rush out first, resulting in a crush at the factory gate. Once, a worker was injured in the crush. To draw the workers' attention, the trade union took a close-up photograph of the scene of the crush at the gate, enlarged it, and hung it at the factory gate.” Needless to say, this "enlarged" "close-up photograph" captured the facts. The intention was simply to highlight something that everyone had become accustomed to but was unreasonable and ridiculous, making people feel it was unsightly and thus eliminating such incidents.

	What happened after this photograph was hung up? "Workers who could recognize their own faces in the photograph and saw their own disheveled appearance felt very uncomfortable"—which is as it should be. It is this "discomfort" that will prevent the "crush" and even the "injury of workers" from happening again. However, some people, in addition to feeling "uncomfortable," also "went to the Party Committee to raise objections (to the photograph)." And when the Party Committee discussed this matter, there were two opposing opinions. One faction believed that although this was satire, it could be used to address shortcomings among the people. The other faction disagreed, arguing that "this approach is a blow to the masses and does not conform to the 'unity—criticism—unity' formula," and so on.

	I do not know which faction's opinion prevailed in the Party Committee's discussion, or perhaps they reached a conclusion with a third opinion. However, the example of reading a satirical work and then "going to the Party Committee (or the newspaper's editorial department, or the relevant Party and government departments, or the author himself) to raise objections," denouncing it as "not conforming to the 'unity—criticism—unity' formula," and equating "satire" with "attack"—such examples are readily available.

	Neither allowing exaggeration nor allowing even a faithful representation like a photograph, as long as it is satire, it should be sentenced to death. If things were done according to the opinions of these comrades, satire would truly be facing its end and have no way out.

	Unfortunately, the development of the situation is not as these people imagine. Satire will not disappear because satire is not something created out of thin air by satirical writers "stirring up waves without wind," but because there is an inherent basis for satire in life—the existence of satirizable facts, and because the people need to use satire to conduct criticism (of course, they also need other forms of criticism). The comrades of the trade union at the Shanghai Wire Factory took such a "close-up photograph" and "enlarged" it. Was it not because they felt the need to do so, rather than wanting to be some kind of satirical writer and therefore create some satirical works?

	As I write this, I want to extend my greetings to the comrades of the trade union at the Shanghai Wire Factory: you took a great photograph. It shows the liveliness, flexibility, and diversity of your work methods. As for those who raise objections to the Party Committee, that's not important; just patiently explain the rationale clearly.

    一张照片引起的
    钟怀
    有人所以反对讽刺，据说是因为讽刺常带夸张。
  “现实生活就是这样的么？”“生活中果真有这等事么？”那意思是，讽刺不外乎是对于现实生活的歪曲，理应禁绝。
    但是也有不带夸张——就像一加一等于二那样，丝毫不带夸张——的讽刺。这种讽刺总该不需要反对的吧。可是不然。我手头有一张4月26日的“解放日报”，在“党的生活”栏里登了这样一件小事：
        “这是上海电线厂的日常现象：下班铃一响，一部
    分工人抢先走出去，结果就在厂门口挤成一团。有一次，
    一个工人被挤伤了。工会为了引起工人的注意，就把在
    门口挤成一团的场面，拍了一张特写照片，放大了，挂
    在厂门口。”不消说，这张“放大了”的“特写照片”照下来的是事实，用意无非是把大家已经习以为常但却不合理并且可笑的事情特别提出，使人看了觉得很不雅观，从而消除这等事情。
    这张照片挂出来以后如何呢？“凡是从照片上能够认出自己面貌的工人，看出自己那幅狼狈的样子，心里很不舒服”——这是应当的，有了这“不舒服”，才会不再有那“挤成一团”乃至“工人被挤伤了”的现象。可是有人除去“不舒服”以外，还“跑到党委会来（对照片）提意见”。而党委会在讨论这事的时候，却也有两派意见，一派认为虽则这是讽刺，但可以用来对付人民内部的缺点。另一派就不以为然，他们认为“这样做法是对群众的打击，不合乎‘团结—批评—团结的’公式”云云。
    我不知道党委会讨论的结果，是哪一派意见占了上风，或许得出了一个第三种意见的结论也说不定。不过，看了一件讽刺作品就“跑到党委会（或报刊编辑部，或党和政府主管部门，或作者本人那里）来提意见”，就斥之为“不合乎‘团结—批评—团结’的公式”；一提及“讽刺”，就想到“打击”，并且在两者之间画上个等号——这样的事例，倒是俯拾皆是的。
    既不容许夸张，又不容许哪怕像照像一般地如实表现，只要是讽刺，就该判处死刑。如果照这些同志的意见办去，讽刺当真是末日已临，走头无路了。
    可惜，形势的发展并不像这些人的想像那样如意。讽刺之所以不会消亡，是因为讽刺并非讽刺作家“无风三尺浪”，凭空制造出来的，而是因为生活中本来就有讽刺的基础——可讽刺的事实，是因为人民需要用讽刺来进行批评（当然也需要其他方式的批评）。上海电线厂的工会工作同志所以要拍这么一张“特写照片”而且加以“放大”，难道不是他们感到需要这样做，而是想当什么讽刺作家，因此才创作一些讽刺作品么？
    写到这里，我要顺便向上海电线厂的工会工作同志致意：你们这张照片拍得好，从这里看得出你们工作方式的生动活泼，多种多样。至于有人向党委会提出意见，那不要紧，耐心地把道理说清楚就行了。
