Xinhua News Agency, May 23rd—An official from the Ministry of Textile Industry told reporters that making yarn finer allows for spinning more yarn from the same amount of cotton. For example, changing cotton meant for 20-count yarn to 21-count yarn can increase length by 5%; changing cotton meant for 40-count yarn to 41-count yarn can increase length by 2.5%. If the warp and weft density of the cloth is not increased or is increased less, more cloth can be woven. Therefore, given the current shortage of raw cotton, many cotton textile factories have adopted or plan to adopt this method to increase cotton cloth production and reduce work stoppage losses. However, as the yarn count becomes finer, the strength of the yarn also decreases. If used for weaving cloth without increasing warp and weft density, the cloth will be thinner than before, the tensile strength will be worse, and it will also be less durable. If the warp and weft density is increased to maintain the quality of the cloth, the goal of increasing production will not be achieved. Therefore, this method can be used for some types of cloth that originally used yarn that was too coarse and not satisfactory to consumers, but not for all types of cloth. He said that currently, some factories have not thoroughly studied the original organization specifications of cotton cloth before making the yarn count finer; some have even made cloth that consumers have long considered too thin even thinner. The result of doing so is that the increase in production is limited, but the quality of the products has decreased significantly. According to experiments by the East China Textile Administration Bureau: After changing yarn serge originally woven with 21-count yarn to 22-count yarn, although two more weft yarns were added per inch, the tensile strength of the cloth in both warp and weft directions still decreased by 6% to 9%, the wear resistance decreased by 12%, while the production only increased by about 2%. Although the quantity of such products on the market is not large, it has already caused some negative reactions. Sales departments in Sichuan, Shandong, Hubei, Guangdong and other places generally believe that general cotton cloth should not be made finer.

This official pointed out that after research by the Ministry of Textile Industry, it is believed that many varieties such as yarn drill, yarn serge, and yarn khaki, which have been produced for a long time and are well-liked by consumers, should not be made finer; People's Cloth, which accounts for 30% of the total cotton cloth, is already considered too thin by most consumers and should not be made finer. Some famous brands such as Dragon Head Cloth and Five Blessings Cloth should be produced according to the original specifications. Any product that has already been made finer and found to be unreasonable should be resolutely changed back. As for some varieties whose original specifications are not suitable for consumer use and unnecessarily consume more cotton yarn, they can be changed. For some cloths used for summer clothing, if the warp and weft density is appropriately increased to ensure that the physical properties of the cloth are no lower than before, the yarn count can also be made slightly finer than before. All products that have changed specifications should be treated as new varieties and put into production after technical appraisal and trial production and sales, in accordance with the methods for new varieties.

    不要随便把纱改细
    据新华社23日讯　纺织工业部一位负责人对记者说，把纱改细，用同样的棉花可以纺出更长的纱。比如把纺二十支纱的棉花改纺二十一支，长度可以增加5％；把纺四十支纱的棉花改纺四十一支，长度可以增加2.5％。如果不增加或少增加布的经纬密度，就能多织一些布。因此，在今年原棉不足的情况下，很多棉纺织厂都采用了或者打算采用这个办法来增加棉布产量，减少停工损失。但是，由于纱支改细以后，纱的强力也随之下降，用来织布，如果不增加经纬密度，布就比以前稀薄，拉力也要差一些，同时也不耐磨。如果增加经纬密度来保持布的质量，又达不到增产的目的。因此，部分原来用纱过粗，不为消费者所满意的布类可以采用这个办法，而不是所有布类都能采用。他说，目前有些工厂对棉布原有的组织规格没有经过细致研究，就把纱支改细；有的还把过去消费者久已认为太薄的布改得更加薄。这样做的结果，增加的产量有限，产品的质量却下降了许多。据华东纺织管理局试验：原来用二十一支纱织的纱哔叽，改用二十二支纱以后，虽然每寸还增加了两根纬纱，但布的经纬向拉力仍然下降6％到9％，耐磨度下降12％，而产量却只增加2％左右。目前这类产品上市的数量虽然不多，但已经引起一些不好的反映。四川、山东、湖北、广东等地的销售部门普遍认为一般棉布不宜改细。
    这位负责人指出，纺织部经过研究以后，认为像纱直贡、纱哔叽、纱卡其等许多品种，过去已经生产很久，素为消费者喜爱，不宜改细；占棉布总量30％的人民市布，大多数消费者还嫌它太薄，更不宜改细。有些名牌货如龙头市布、五福布等，更应按原来的规格进行生产。凡是已经改细，发现不合理的，应该坚决改回来。至于有些品种，原来的规格就不适合消费者使用要求，又不必要地多耗用棉纱，则可以改。有些作夏季服装用的布，如果适当增加经纬密度，保证布的物理性能不比原来低，纱支也可以比原来改细一些。凡是改变了规格的产品，应一律作为新品种，按照新品种的办法，经过技术鉴定和试制试销以后再投入生产。
