Seeking Truth from Facts, Distinguishing Right from Wrong
Tang Yongtong, Vice President of Peking University

This time, the Party is carrying out rectification, and non-Party members have raised many opinions and criticisms. At first, I felt a little nervous and almost lost confidence. I wondered why there were so many problems, so serious; but later this idea slowly changed, and I felt that the more exposure of contradictions within the people, the better. Everyone has raised so many criticisms of the Party's shortcomings, which is not a bad thing but a good thing. This is a phenomenon that our country should have in the current historical development, because our socialist revolution has been basically completed, and now we have entered a new historical period of socialist construction. The main contradiction in the country is the contradiction between the people's need for rapid economic and cultural development and the current economic and cultural situation that cannot meet the people's needs. Therefore, there are many problems in the internal life of the people, especially in culture and education. Everyone feels that it must be done well, so everyone is eager to speak out, and there is nothing to worry about. Everyone should not only speak, but also speak loudly and especially. I have read some articles in the newspaper, and I most agree with the opinions of Mr. Ma (Yinchu), Mr. Chen Yuan, and Mr. Fu Ying. Although their opinions are not exactly the same as mine, they are basically consistent. However, I am reminded of the words in the Book of Songs: "Who breeds disorder? Now it has become a hindrance." This sentence is worth pondering. I think some of our democratic人士, like myself, should reflect on this. The Party unites us and relies on us to do things well. If some things have not been done well, is it entirely the Party's fault? I don't think so. Some things were not done well because we didn't use our brains at the time and were unwilling to speak up. For example, during the adjustment of departments and faculties, let me ask, what were you, Mr. Tang, doing? Did you know there was a problem at the time, and did you argue for it? The problem arose because you didn't use your brain and were unwilling to speak up - afraid to speak, unwilling to speak. Now that the shortcomings have been exposed, I think our spirit should be mainly focused on "learning from past mistakes to avoid future ones" and correcting shortcomings. The fact that things were not done well was due to the three evils within the Party, but we democratic人士 cannot shirk our responsibility either. We should realize that we should not abandon our responsibility in the future. From now on, we must speak more, speak loudly, and speak frequently.

Mr. Ma said well, don't only see the bad and not the good, and an angry attitude is not good. The most important thing is to analyze in a realistic manner how the shortcomings came about, and to take responsibility for however much responsibility one has. I also have a share in some things at the school, and I can't only blame Party Secretary Jiang Longji. At the beginning of the Liberation, I didn't quite understand the Party's brilliance, correctness, and greatness, and I didn't dare to speak. Later, I understood the Party a little more, and I began to get closer to the Party and cooperate with the Party, but the sense of ownership was still not enough. I always held this attitude: "Since the Party has decided, then let it be!" This gave up my own share of responsibility.

To illustrate this point, I can give an example. Peking University doesn't have enough housing, and this problem is very serious. There are more students enrolled and more tasks, and the corresponding basic construction needs to be expanded, but the Ministry of Higher Education doesn't give us enough construction area. The Ministry of Higher Education has a subjective view that the potential of Peking University's housing is very large and has not been fully utilized. We have repeatedly raised this issue with Director Zhang Zonglin of the Ministry, saying that there is really not enough housing. To prove that his view was wrong, we accompanied him to visit various places in Peking University in person to let him understand the situation, but he still refused to believe it. Before I fell ill, I went to the Ministry of Higher Education to talk to the Minister about the housing problem at Peking University. Deputy Director Zhang Jian of the Ministry also excitedly said to Comrade Zhang Zonglin: "We are being too tight on Peking University's housing!" I thought that the problem would be better resolved after this, but after I was seriously ill and stayed in the hospital for a period of time, when I asked about the housing problem, it had not been well resolved. It is said that the Ministry of Higher Education is now beginning to realize that Peking University's housing probably has no potential. But it must also be pointed out that the overcrowding of housing is sometimes due to our lack of comprehensive planning. For example, during the adjustment of departments and faculties in 1952, we only made arrangements for teachers with families and single people, but we didn't think about the fact that young teachers would get married, and we didn't plan for the houses they would need when they got married. This shows that while the subjectivism and bureaucracy of the Ministry of Higher Education are responsible for the housing problem, we also have shortcomings in our planning work due to insufficient concern for our comrades.

There is a lot of bureaucracy in the Ministry of Higher Education, and this is just one example. There are many other things like this. I have expressed my opinions on some issues, but I have not fought for them hard enough. I always thought, "The leadership has already decided, this is your Communist Party's business." Is this the attitude of a master?

Therefore, problems should be dealt with in a realistic manner. - Opinions should be raised in a realistic manner, and opinions should be accepted in a realistic manner. Simply putting on labels or simply accepting labels without analysis will not solve the problem.

The Ministry of Higher Education has not really studied how to run universities. I have the impression that the Party paid attention to the recovery and construction of industry very early on, and spent a lot of effort to study it. But in terms of culture and education, my impression is not the same. After the takeover, there was no mature plan. First, the issue of uniting and transforming intellectuals was raised, followed by the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns. By the time of the adjustment of departments and faculties, should they have known how to run higher education? But the result was no. The situation in recent years can fully prove that the work of the Ministry of Higher Education has been very blind. Comrade Qian Junrui initially blindly and subjectively emphasized comprehensively learning from the Soviet Union, even saying: "It's okay to learn badly, it's better than not learning." This is not considering our own needs and our own traditions, this is dogmatism. Of course, Comrade Qian Junrui is not completely wrong, we should learn from the Soviet Union, but what is the meaning of saying that it is okay to learn badly?

In fact, the leaders of the Ministry of Higher Education blindly learning from the Soviet Union, not linking it to China's reality, and disregarding our country's traditions was already dogmatism. Moreover, they did not know deeply how the Soviet Union ran universities at that time, but only heard how it was. To give an example: what exactly should universities do? This is a question. Of course, since it is a school, it should focus on teaching, but this does not mean that it should not engage in scientific research. However, the Ministry of Higher Education did not deeply understand the experience of Soviet higher education. It blindly believed that universities were mainly engaged in teaching, so it neglected scientific research. During the Three-Anti Movement and the ideological remolding movement, the focus was on criticizing the "purely technical viewpoint," which was correct. But this does not mean that scientific research should not be carried out. Because the Ministry of Higher Education one-sidedly emphasized teaching, many people were unwilling to do or did not do scientific research. Looking at it now, underestimating scientific research is a big mistake. In this way, teaching and scientific research were separated, and the quality of teaching could not be improved. Is this really the case in the Soviet Union? No, it isn't. In 1953, Soviet experts came to Peking University, and they strongly encouraged teachers to do scientific research, saying that universities must do scientific research. At this time, I was shocked: it turned out that we had misunderstood in the past. Soviet Minister of Higher Education Yelyutin also recently gave a report saying that teaching and scientific research cannot be separated. Now this issue is clear. At that time, the Ministry of Higher Education only emphasized teaching, emphasizing it to the point of squeezing out scientific research, as if teaching was the business of the school and scientific research was the business of the Academy of Sciences. As for whether the improvement of teaching quality was related to scientific research, the Ministry of Higher Education rarely asked about it before.

Because teaching and scientific research were separated, the problem of poor cooperation between the Ministry of Higher Education system and the Academy of Sciences also arose. The cooperation between universities and the Academy of Sciences has not been good enough. Why is "the heart oriented towards the Academy"? Because the Ministry of Higher Education and the Academy of Sciences both have the same mistaken view that scientific research and teaching do not need to be linked, that universities do not need to attach importance to scientific research, and that scientific research should be handled by the Academy of Sciences. Therefore, experts in universities believe that since the school does not attach importance to scientific research and the Academy of Sciences needs people, "the heart is oriented towards the Academy" has emerged. My opinion is that professors in schools should also do scientific research, and researchers in the Academy of Sciences should also teach when needed. Many of the academic achievements of our country in the past were made in school teaching. After Mr. Jin Yuelin returned from studying abroad, he has been a professor, and his "Logic" is his textbook. Mr. Hua Luogeng won the first prize in the science award this time, indicating that he has made great achievements in scientific research, but he has also been teaching in schools for many years. Now, many up-and-coming scientists have been trained by them. The Academy of Sciences wants to invite some of our experts, but in fact, if it is clearly affirmed that teachers must do scientific research, then why should they be asked to give up teaching? I also think that the Academy of Sciences' approach is wrong. They want to pull people from Peking University, so we have undue vigilance against the Academy of Sciences. This makes the relationship bad. I believe that universities must conduct scientific research, and the scientific research work can be planned and led by the Academy of Sciences in a unified way, but it is not necessary to invite all the talents to the Academy of Sciences.

Finally, I would also like to talk about the issue of Party leadership in universities.

Rectification is a good thing. Because the Party serves the people, it dares to expose mistakes, and because it is armed with Marxism-Leninism, it will definitely be able to correct mistakes. But even though the Party has made mistakes and has shortcomings, we cannot doubt the Party's brilliance, greatness, and correctness.

From my personal experience, when I was young, I saw that China was an extremely poor, backward, and weak country that was about to be divided by the powers. Now I see that China is an emerging and powerful socialist country. The soldiers I knew in the old China were aging, oppressive green camp soldiers, while the new China's army is the people's own army that has mastered the world's advanced military technology. The workers I saw at that time were coolies exploited by imperialism, while now they are the working class who have become the masters of the country. Our peasants are getting rid of poverty and ignorance and will all become well-fed, well-clothed, cultured, educated, and advanced collective farmers. In my youth, I personally saw that Zhang Zhidong's new policies were only about running some pin factories, but now we can manufacture jet planes, locomotives, automobiles, and ships. From the late Qing Dynasty to the early Republic of China, I studied at Tsinghua School for eight years. The student life at that time was really worlds apart from the student life now. Those foreign-recruited, poorly performing, twenty-something foreign devils were like the supreme emperors in the school. They couldn't teach their lessons, but they drove away the Chinese Dean of Academic Affairs. Students protested against the school because they ate too badly and were expelled nine people. My family lived in the Dongcheng District of the city. At that time, there were no cars, trams, or other means of transportation, and I couldn't afford a rickshaw. It took me six or seventy li to walk back and forth home on the same day. What are the living conditions of our Tsinghua University students now? As for the improvement of our country's international status since liberation, it goes without saying. Only under the leadership of the Party have the people changed the face of the old China. When the Chinese people mention the Communist Party, they often call the CCP "our Party" with gratitude and pride. Indeed, the Party has gained the trust of the people throughout the country, and the people believe in the Party's leadership. "Observing the past to know the future," since the Party has been able to lead political, military, industrial, and agricultural construction well in the past, then why can't it lead culture and education now? Especially now, four or five years after the adjustment of departments and faculties, and after this rectification, can't the Party better lead universities? We can conclude that the Party will definitely be able to lead cultural construction, lead scientific undertakings, and lead education undertakings well.

But now I hear some people raising the slogan: "The Party should withdraw from schools." Does this mean that there is doubt about the Party's leadership and leadership ability? If there is this meaning, I resolutely and extremely disagree. The cultural and educational circles need the Party to lead, and this point cannot be shaken. I absolutely disagree with calling on the Party to withdraw from schools. If the Party withdraws from schools, then who should the people's cultural and educational undertakings be handed over to lead? The idea of "professors governing the school" can be discussed at length, but we must not forget that we have had experience in this area in the past, and professors governing the school is not necessarily very democratic. I also don't like to hear the term "democratic school governance." I think this term is inappropriate. Saying "democratic school governance" now is as if it wasn't very democratic in the past. As far as I know, it was only after the Eighth National Congress that the system of president responsibility under the leadership of the Party Committee of the school was clarified. There are shortcomings in the work style of Party member cadres, and there is a wall between Party members and non-Party members, which is a fact. But we cannot therefore think that the Party is not democratic. Our Party is originally the Party of the people, the democratic Party, so we can only say that the work style of some Party member cadres is not democratic, but we cannot say that the Party is not democratic. Of course, it is also possible that those who raised the term "democratic school governance" did not originally mean this, but it is easy to cause misunderstandings and should be clarified.

Some people now say that ideological remolding, the Three-Anti and Five-Anti campaigns, etc., were not done well, and I also disagree with this. Although there were some deviations in these works, our intellectuals can examine the changes between our "old selves" and "new selves," and where these changes come from. Isn't this the effectiveness of the Party's education (including the ideological remolding movement, the Three-Anti and Five-Anti campaigns, the honest and truthful movement, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement, the adjustment of departments and faculties, etc.)? So I think the ideological remolding movement should continue. Participating in the current rectification movement is an excellent opportunity for ideological remolding.

Some people feel that there is a lack of close friends now, and I often feel this way myself. I think this feeling of loneliness is certainly related to the sectarianism of Party member comrades, but do we also have some problems ourselves (such as being arrogant)? I agree that the wall should be torn down from both sides.

Mr. Fu Ying mentioned that the Party should not only like to listen to words of praise. This meaning is very good, and it is to call on Party members to be vigilant. Some Party leaders like to hear good words and don't like to hear criticism, and some cadres below are also accustomed to reporting good news and not bad news, which is not good. However, I think it is also possible to analyze it: the "praise" of today and the "praise" of the past that slaves gave to the reactionary ruling class are fundamentally different in nature. When we shout "Long live the Communist Party," we are not trying to compliment anyone - Chairman Mao does not like others to compliment him. I think if Mr. Fu's words are understood as the people's joy and excitement over the victory of their own cause being the same as flattering in the old society, then this confuses two things that are essentially different.

    实事求是，分清是非
    北京大学副校长　汤用彤
    这一次党进行整风，党外人士提出了很多意见和批评。开始时我觉得有些紧张，几乎失去信心了。我想为什么问题这么多，这么严重；但后来这种想法慢慢改变了，感到对于人民内部矛盾的揭露愈多就愈是好。大家对党的缺点提出了这么多的批评，这不是坏事而是好事。这是我们国家在当前历史发展上应有的现象，因为我国社会主义革命已经基本上完成，现在进入了社会主义建设的新的历史时期，国内的主要矛盾已经是人民对于经济文化迅速发展的需要同当前经济文化不能满足人民需要的状况之间的矛盾。因此在人民生活内部，特别是在文化教育方面问题很多，大家都觉得非弄好不可，所以大家都急于把话讲出来，这没有什么可担忧的。大家不但应该说，而且应该大说而特说。报上的文章我看了一些，我最赞成马老（寅初）、陈垣先生、傅鹰先生的意见，他们的意见和我的意见虽然不完全相同，但基本上一致。不过我想起诗经上的话：“谁生厉阶，至今为梗”，这句话是值得深思的。我想我们一些民主人士，像我这样的人，是应当反省一下的。党团结我们，倚赖我们是想把事情办好。有好些事情没有办好，这是不是完全要怪党呢？我想不是。有些事情办得不好也要怪我们当时未动脑筋，不肯说话。比如院系调整时，试问你姓汤的干嘛呢？当时你是不是知道有毛病，知道了是不是争了呢？毛病就出在你没有动脑筋，不肯说话——不敢说、不愿说，现在缺点暴露出来了，我想我们的精神应当以“惩前毖后”、改正缺点为最主要。事情没办好固然是由于党内的三害，可是我们民主人士也是不能辞其咎的。我们应该觉悟，以后不要放弃责任了。从现在起就要多说、大说、经常说。
    马老说得好，不要只看见坏处，不看见好处，出气的态度是不好的。最要紧的是实事求是去分析，缺点究竟是怎样来的，有几分责任，就说几分责任。学校里一些事情我也有份，不能只怪党委书记江隆基同志。解放初，我并不怎么明了党的英明、正确和伟大，不敢讲话。以后对党了解一些了，开始靠拢党，和党合作，但主人翁的思想还是不够的。总是抱这样的态度：“既然党内决定了，就这样吧！”这就放弃了自己的一份责任。
    为了说明这一点可以举一件事情为例。北大的房子不够，这个问题很严重。招生多，任务多，需要相应地扩大基本建设，可是高教部不给我们足够建筑面积。高教部有一个主观的看法，就是认为北大房屋的潜力很大，没有充分利用。我们多次向张宗麟司长提起这个问题，说房子实在不够用，为证明他的看法不对，曾陪他亲自在北大各处去看了一看，让他了解情况，可是他还是不肯相信。我病以前有一次到高教部和部长谈北大的房子问题，部里张健副司长也激昂地对张宗麟同志说：“我们对北大的房子卡的太紧了！”我以为此后问题比较好解决了，那知我大病住了一个时期医院以后，问到房子问题，还没有很好解决。据说高教部现在开始认识到北大的房子恐怕是没有潜力了。但也必须指出房子挤，有时候是由于我们规划不够全面，例如1952年院系调整时，在教员中我们只对有家属和单身的人作了安排，可是没有想到年青的教员就要结婚，而他们结婚所需要的房子我们就没有规划进去。这说明在房子问题上高教部的主观主义、官僚主义固然有责任，但我们由于关心同志不够，在规划工作上也存在缺点。
    高教部的官僚主义很多，这不过是一例，还有好多事情也是这样。对于有的问题，我不是没有提过意见，但没有力争。心里总以为“领导上已经决定了，这是你们共产党的事”。这难道是主人翁的态度吗？
    所以对待问题要实事求是。——提意见时要实事求是，接受意见时也要实事求是。光戴帽子或光接受帽子而不加以分析是不能解决问题的。
    高教部没有真正地研究一下高等学校究竟应该怎样办。我有这样的印象：在工业的恢复和建设方面党是很早就注意了的，而且花了很大的气力来研究的。可是在文教方面，我的印象就不是这样。接管后并没有一套成熟的方案，先是提出团结和改造知识分子的问题，以后是抗美援朝、“三反”“五反”。到院系调整时总该知道高等教育应如何办了吧？结果不然。这几年的情况完全可以证明高教部的工作很盲目。钱俊瑞同志开始是盲目地、主观地强调全面学习苏联，甚至说：学习坏了也可以，也比不学好。这就是不考虑我们自己的需要和自己的传统，这就是教条主义。当然，钱俊瑞同志也不是完全错的，我们是应该学习苏联的，但是如果说学习坏了也可以，这是什么话呢？
    其实高教部的领导人盲目地学习苏联，不联系中国实际，不顾我国的传统，已经是教条主义，况且他们那时并不深知苏联是怎样办高等学校的，只是听说如何如何而已。举一个例：高等学校到底搞什么？这就是一个问题。当然，既是学校，总应该以教学为主，但这并不等于说就不要搞科学研究。可是高教部并没有深入了解苏联高等教育的经验如何，盲目地以为高等学校是以教学为主，就忽视了科学研究。三反运动和思想改造运动时，着重批判“纯技术观点”，这是对的。可是这也不等于说不要搞科学研究。由于高教部片面强调教学，就有许多人不愿意做或不做科学研究。现在看来，轻视科学研究，这是一个很大的错误。这样一来，教学和科学研究分了家，教学质量就不能提高。其实苏联是不是这样呢？不是的。1953年苏联专家到北大，他们十分鼓励教师做科学研究，说大学非做科学研究不可。这时我才大吃一惊：原来是我们过去了解错了。苏联高教部部长叶留金最近作报告也说：教学和科学研究不能分开。现在这个问题算是明确了。那时，高教部只强调教学，强调得把科学研究也挤掉了，好像教学是学校的事，科学研究是科学院的事。至于教学质量的提高是否与科学研究有关系，以前高教部也很少过问。
    由于把教学和科学研究割裂开来，这样，也发生了高等教育部系统和科学院不能很好合作的问题。高等学校和科学院这两方面是配合得不够好的。为什么“人心向院”呢？因为高教部和科学院都有同一的错误观点，以为科学研究和教学不必联系起来，高等学校不必重视科学研究，而科学研究应归科学院包下来，因此高等学校的专家们认为，既然学校不重视科学研究，而科学院又需要人，就产生了“人心向院”。我的意见是学校的教授也应该做科学研究，科学院的研究人员在需要时也应当教学。我国过去学术上的一些成绩，好多是在学校教学中搞出来的。金岳霖先生留学回国后一直当教授，他的“逻辑”就是他的教本。华罗庚先生这次得了科学奖金一等奖，表明他在科学研究上有很大的成绩，但他也是多年在学校里任教的，现在有不少后进的科学家是经过他们培养的。科学院想把我们的一些专家都请去，其实，如果明确肯定教师必须做科学研究，那又何必叫他们放弃教学呢？我也觉得科学院的做法是错误的。他们想拉北大的人，我们就对科学院有了不应有的戒心。这样关系就搞不好。我认为大学必须进行科学研究，至于科学研究工作可以由科学院来统一规划，统一领导，但不必把人材都请到科学院去。
    最后，我还想谈谈高等学校中党的领导问题。
    整风是好事。党，由于是为人民服务的，所以勇于揭发错误，又由于它是用马克思列宁主义武装起来的，所以又一定能改正错误。但是尽管党有错误，有缺点，我们不能怀疑党的英明、伟大和正确。
    以我个人的经历来说，我在小的时候看到的中国是一个极端贫困、落后而将被列强所瓜分的弱国，而现在我看到的中国是一个新兴的、强大的社会主义国家。我所知道的旧中国的兵士是衰老的、压迫人民的绿营兵，而现在新中国的军队是掌握了世界先进军事技术的人民自己的军队。我那时看到的工人是被帝国主义压榨的苦力，而现在则是作了国家主人的工人阶级。我们的农民正在摆脱贫困愚昧的状态而将全变为丰衣足食的、有文化有教育的、先进的集体农民。我少年时代亲眼看到张之洞的新政不过是办一些针钉的工厂，而现在我们已经能够制造喷气式飞机、火车头、汽车和轮船。在前清末到民初我在清华学校前后学习了八年，那时学生生活与现在学生生活真有天渊之别，那些由外国招来的成绩很差的二十多岁的洋鬼子在学校里就是太上皇。他们课讲不了，反而把中国的教务长赶跑了。学生因为吃的太坏而对学校抗议，反而被开除了九个人。我家住在城里东城，那时没有汽车、电车等交通工具，洋车又坐不起，回家当日往返须步行六、七十里，现在我们的清华大学的同学生活条件是什么样呢？至于解放以来我国国际地位的提高，那就更不用说了。只有在党的领导下，人民群众才改变了旧中国的面貌。中国人民提起了共产党常常是用感激和骄傲的心情称呼中共为“我们的党”。的确，党已经得到全国人民的信任，人民相信党的领导。“察往以知来”，既然党过去能很好地领导政治、军事和工业农业建设。那么，现在在文化教育上又为什么不能领导呢？特别是现在在院系调整四、五年以后，又经过这次整风，难道党还不能更好地领导高等学校吗？我们可以断定党一定能很好地领导文化建设，领导科学事业和教育事业。
    但是现在我听到有人提出了这样的口号：党退出学校。这是不是对党的领导权和领导能力有怀疑的意思呢？假如有这个意思我是坚决地、极端地不赞成的。文教界要党来领导，这一点是不能动摇的。我绝不同意叫党退出学校。如果党退出学校，那么需要把人民的文教事业交给谁去领导呢？教授治校之类的意见是可以从长讨论的，但是我们不要忘了在这方面我们过去也有过经验，教授治校并不一定就很民主。我也不喜欢听“民主治校”的名词，我觉得这名词不妥。说现在“民主治校”就好像过去是不怎么民主似的。据我了解“八大”以后才明确学校的党委领导下的校长负责制。党员干部作风有缺点，党和非党之间有墙，这是事实。但不能因此认为党不民主。我们的党本来就是人民的党，民主的党，所以只能说某些党员干部的作风不民主，而不能说党不民主。当然，也可能提“民主治校”的人原来不是这样的意思，不过容易引起误会，应该说清。
    现在也有人提出来：思想改造、三反五反等搞的不好，这一点我也不同意。虽然在这些工作中有些偏差，但是我们知识分子可以考察一下，我们的“旧我”和“新我”之间的变化，以及这种变化从何而来？难道这不是党的教育（包括思想改造运动、三反五反、忠诚老实运动、肃反运动、院系调整等）的功效吗？所以我觉得思想改造运动应该继续下去。参加当前的整风运动就是一个思想改造的绝好机会。
    有人觉得现在缺乏知心朋友，我自己也常有这感觉。我想这种寂寞之感，固然和党员同志的宗派主义作风有关，但我们自己是否也有些问题（如自高自大之类）？我赞成墙是要从两边来拆的。
    傅鹰先生提到党不应该只喜欢听歌功颂德的话。这意思是很好的，是叫党员提起警惕。有些党内领导同志是爱听好话，不爱听批评，而下面有些干部也习惯于报喜不报忧，这是不好的。不过我觉得也还可以分析一下：现在的“歌功颂德”和过去那种奴才对反动统治阶级的“歌功颂德”，在本质上是根本不同的。我们喊“共产党万岁”，这不是要恭维谁——毛主席就不喜欢别人恭维。我想傅先生的话如果被人了解为现在人民对于自己事业的胜利的欢欣鼓舞就是旧社会的拍马屁，这就混淆了本质上不同的两件事情。
