    Hebei Provincial Party Committee Invites Democrats to Help with Rectification
    Liu Qingyang Criticizes Insufficient Airing of Views in the Province
    (Our newspaper's Baoding dispatch, May 13th) The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held a forum with democratic figures on the morning of May 11th. Participants included the heads of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the Hebei local organizations of various democratic parties, and non-party democratic figures, totaling twenty people. Lin Tie, First Secretary of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, requested at the meeting that non-Party figures speak frankly and exhaustively to help the Party rectify its three malpractices.
    Some democratic figures advocated that democratic parties should carry out rectification together with the Communist Party. In this regard, Comrade Lin Tie said that in this rectification movement, the focus should still be on criticizing the shortcomings and errors of the Communist Party, because only when the Communist Party first rectifies the three malpractices can the gap between the Party and the democratic parties be bridged.
    Democratic figures initially raised some criticisms of the Party's work. Zhang Yan, Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Baoding Branch of the Jiusan Society, said that the three malpractices are less common among senior cadres at the central and provincial levels, but more common and more serious at the county level, and some rural cadres are simply like "little emperors." Yang Naijun, Deputy Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Jiusan Society, criticized the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party regarding the water conservancy problems in Hebei Province. He said that Hebei has suffered reduced production due to floods for many years. Although many people have put forward suggestions for water management, the Party Committee has not regarded it as a key issue for research and resolution, and there has never been a clear policy, resulting in long-term disagreement in water management work and constant wavering between flood control and the development of small-scale water conservancy. Qi Biting, Vice Chairman of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, requested that the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party immediately take charge of water management work, promptly convene meetings of relevant departments, and conduct practical overall planning to ensure this year's agricultural harvest and eliminate water conservancy disputes between regions. Liu Qingyang, Chairman of the Hebei Provincial Preparatory Committee of the China Democratic League, criticized that Hebei Province's "airing" and "letting go" are not enough. She said that this is primarily reflected in the Hebei Daily.
    Lin Tie, on behalf of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, expressed acceptance of everyone's criticisms.

    河北省委请民主人士帮助整风
    刘清扬批评省内鸣放都不够
    本报保定13日电　中共河北省委于11日上午举行了民主人士座谈会，参加座谈的有政协河北省委员会、各民主党派河北省地方组织的负责人和无党派民主人士共二十人。中共河北省委第一书记林铁在会上要求党外人士知无不言、言无不尽地帮助党整掉三种歪风。
    有些民主人士主张民主党派应和共产党一起整风。对此，林铁同志说，在这次整风运动中，还是要集中地批判共产党的缺点和错误，因为只有共产党先整掉三个歪风，党和民主党派之间的沟才可以填平。
    民主人士们对党的工作初步提出了一些批评。九三学社保定分社筹备委员会主任委员张岩说，三种歪风在中央和省的高级干部中较少，到县一级就较多、较严重，有些乡村干部简直像个“小皇帝”。九三学社筹备委员会副主任委员杨乃俊就河北省的水利问题对中共河北省委提出了批评。他说，河北历年因水灾减产，虽有不少人提出了治水建议，但党委没把它当作关键问题加以研究解决，始终没有一个明确的方针，以致在治水工作上长期意见不一致，在治水方法上总是摇摆在防洪和开展小型水利之间。政协河北省委员会副主席齐璧亭要求中共河北省委立即把治水工作领导起来，迅速召开有关部门会议，进行切实的统筹安排。以保证今年的农业丰收和消除地区间的水利纠纷。民盟河北省筹备委员会主任委员刘清扬批评河北省“鸣”和“放”的都不够。她说，这首先表现在河北日报上。
    林铁代表中共河北省委表示接受大家的批评。
