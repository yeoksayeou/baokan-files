    Xinhua News Agency, Singapore, 29th: Nearly ten thousand workers at the British naval base in Singapore held a twenty-four-hour strike today to protest the mass layoff of more than four hundred workers by the British naval authorities.

    A union spokesman said that the union committee would meet tonight to discuss further actions.

    Meanwhile, in Singapore city, three hundred and fifty workers belonging to two bus companies went on strike on the afternoon of May 27th. These striking workers are protesting the two bus companies' refusal to recognize their union and are demanding the reinstatement of dozens of dismissed workers.

    Workers on pineapple plantations are also engaging in work slowdowns to demand that the employers agree to their demands for improved living conditions. It is reported that pineapples worth approximately 1.3 million Malayan dollars are rotting in the fields due to the closure of canning factories. If the problem cannot be resolved in the near future, even more pineapples will rot.

    菠萝种植园的工人也采取放慢工作的斗争形式，要求资方答应他们的改善生活待遇要求。据报道，由于罐头工厂停工，有价值约达马来亚币一百三十万元的菠萝正在烂在地里。如果问题不能在最近期间获得解决，腐烂的菠萝将会更多。
