Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, May 28th, reporter Chen Zilin reports: Ninety percent of the steel needed to manufacture automobiles can now be supplied domestically. This is the conclusion reached by the First Automotive Works after recently investigating the production conditions of various metallurgical plants across the country. In order to maximize the use of domestically produced steel and produce more cars, the automotive plant's technical personnel have already modified many automobile parts that were previously produced using imported materials to be produced with domestically produced materials.

Since the First Automotive Works officially started production, the most prominent contradiction in production has been the shortage of steel supply. Last year, more than 70% of the steel used to produce cars relied on foreign imports. This not only consumed a large amount of the country's foreign exchange, but also caused frequent work stoppages and waiting for materials due to long distances and untimely supply, making it impossible to guarantee large-scale assembly line production. Since the beginning of this year, the factory's technical personnel have reviewed the materials used for various parts of the car, and modified more than fifty designs based on the needs of domestic users and the steel supply situation. For example, using wood instead of metal for parts such as the driver's cab footrest, door inner cover, and seat cushion base frame not only saves steel but also does not affect the car's performance. Appropriately reducing the thickness and weight of some parts can also save a considerable amount of imported steel. Of significant importance in reducing imported steel is the large-scale use of domestically produced hot-rolled steel sheets to replace imported cold-rolled steel sheets in the manufacture of various cold-stamped parts for automobiles. The designs for the parts to be changed have now been completed, and the process department is preparing for production and will gradually put them into production.

In order to broadly expand domestic sources of supply and minimize the use of imported steel, Ma Chengzhai, the deputy director of the First Automotive Works, and Soviet metallurgical expert Goschev recently visited more than twenty metallurgical plants in fifteen cities across the country. As a result of their consultations with these plants, they believe that, except for about 10% of special steel that domestic conditions are not yet able to produce, 90% of the steel can be supplied domestically. The steel plants in Anshan and Taiyuan, among other locations, are already capable of trial-manufacturing and producing cold-rolled thin steel sheets and cold heading stock, which were previously thought to be impossible to produce domestically. Cold-rolled steel strips, which were also entirely reliant on imports in the past, were found to be produced by more than seventy factories in Shanghai this time, and these factories currently have insufficient tasks and can accept orders at any time. All metallurgical plants have expressed active support for the First Automotive Works' orders and have generally requested fixed sources of supply. They believe that this is very beneficial to both sides' future production.

    用国内钢材代替进口钢材
    第一汽车厂经过调查和修改设计
    国内供应的钢材可从30％提高到90％
    新华社长春28日电　新华社记者陈子林报道：制造汽车需要的钢材，已经有90％可以由国内供应。这是第一汽车制造厂在最近调查了全国各个冶金厂的生产条件之后作出的结论。汽车厂的技术人员，为着最大限度地利用国产钢材多产汽车，已经把许多用进口材料生产的汽车零件改用国产材料生产。
    第一汽车制造厂从正式开工生产以来，生产中最突出的矛盾是钢材供应不足。去年生产汽车所用的钢材，有70％以上是依靠国外进口的。这样不但耗费了国家大量外汇，而且因路途遥远，供应不及时，经常停工待料，无法保证大量流水生产。今年以来，这个厂的技术人员审查了汽车上各种零件所用的材料，根据国内用户需要和钢材供应情况，修改了五十多项设计。例如用木料代替金属做汽车驾驶室的搭脚板、车门内盖板、坐垫底架等零件，既节省钢材又不影响汽车性能。适当的减少一部分零件的厚度和重量，也可以节省不少进口钢材。对减少进口钢材具有重要作用的，是大量地采用国产热轧钢板代替进口冷轧钢板制造汽车上各种冷冲压件。现在决定更改设计的零件，图纸已经制好，正由工艺部门进行生产准备，陆续投入生产。
    为了广泛开拓国内货源，尽量少用进口钢材，第一汽车厂的副厂长马诚斋和苏联冶金专家高斯切夫最近曾到全国十五个城市的二十多个冶金厂访问。经过他们和这些厂协商结果，认为：目前除有10％左右的特殊钢材国内还没有条件生产以外，有90％的钢材国内可以供应。过去认为国内一向无法生产的冷轧薄钢板、冷镦料，鞍山和太原等地的钢厂已经有条件进行试制和生产。冷轧钢带过去也全靠进口，这次他们发现上海有七十多家工厂生产这种钢带，而且这些厂目前任务不足，可以随时接受订货。各个冶金厂对第一汽车厂订货都表示积极支持，并且普遍要求固定货源。他们认为这对双方今后生产都很有利。
