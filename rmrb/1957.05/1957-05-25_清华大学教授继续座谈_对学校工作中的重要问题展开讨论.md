Tsinghua University Professors Continue Discussions
Discussing Important Issues in School Work
    This newspaper reports that since the beginning of the rectification campaign at Tsinghua University, the Party committee has invited professors to numerous symposiums to offer opinions to the school's Party organization, continuing the in-depth rectification.
    Li Jixiang said that the leadership of the Party committee is definitely necessary. Jin Xiwu believes that professor governance is an oligarchy.
    Many professors have expressed opinions on the school system. Professor Li Jixiang said that in the past, the method of professor governance, where everything was decided by the conveners, was inappropriate. The leadership of the Party committee is definitely necessary, but he questioned whether an inter-party joint organization could be established to assist the Party in its work, playing a role of consultation, reflecting opinions, and publicity, while the school board plays a role of legislation and decision-making. School representatives could be more comprehensive, and there could be a permanent institution. Professor Jin Xiwu also believes that professor governance is an oligarchy, and the school should rely on older teachers, but professor governance is not necessary. He suggested that the Party committee implement leadership, expand the school board, absorb teachers and staff to participate, and strengthen the authority of the school board's resolutions, and the department heads should also have more power. Professor Wu Zhonghua put forward a comprehensive suggestion to change the leadership organization of the school and the departments. This is to expand the Party committee system, elect some representatives by the masses to participate in the Party committee to jointly do leadership work, so that it can better represent the situation of the whole school. But this kind of leadership only reaches the department level, mainly the leadership of the general policy. The department only needs a department head to lead and represent the whole department, and another Party branch secretary (or called deputy department head, department secretary) to assist in the work, and each professional has representatives to participate in the department's work. Special attention should be paid to strengthening the role of the teaching and research group, so that the director truly becomes the director, not the secretary becoming the director. The secretary of the teaching and research group can be elected by everyone, and does not have to be a Party member. Party members can play a role in the teaching and research group as Party members. Associate Professor Wang Buxuan agreed with this opinion very much. Associate Professor Guo Shikang believes that it is not necessary to do so. He put forward another suggestion: At present, the school board has not played a role, can it be composed by selecting outstanding cadres (including Party and non-Party members). He said that using the CPPCC's method, that is, taking care of the representatives of all parties, does not solve the problem.
    Xu Zhangben said, "Using Marxism as a guiding ideology will definitely produce dogmatism." He suggested "abolishing the use of Marxism-Leninism as a guiding ideology."
    Professor Xu Zhangben said: Here I would like to talk about the source of dogmatism. I think the source of dogmatism is related to our guiding ideology.
    Xu Zhangben said that he believes that using Marxism as a guiding ideology will definitely produce dogmatism; because any theory is produced under certain historical conditions and has its limitations. If a relatively fixed theory is used as a guiding ideology, it will inevitably commit dogmatism. He said that even the most intelligent leader will make mistakes. The ideal of Marxism-Leninism is communism, but communism is the ideal of all mankind, not just the ideal of Marxism-Leninism. India's pursuit of lofty ideals is also very profound. The ideal of Marxism-Leninism cannot include everything only with political and economic content. Therefore, there will be problems if we use the theory of Marxism-Leninism to deal with all contradictory problems. Some mistakes are unavoidable, and some mistakes are caused by the use of Marxist-Leninist political and economic theories. No theory can include all the truth. The economy and production are formed by the people themselves, so saying that the economic environment determines people's thoughts is dogmatism.
    He said that any contradiction is related to the contradictions of the previous generation and the contemporary guiding ideology. Marxist-Leninist theory is one thing, but to take everything as the basis for this will limit oneself.
    He said that no scholar or theory can include all the good things. If we want cultural development, it is not enough to solve the internal contradictions of the people. We must abolish the restriction of using one theory to guide everything. Communism has not yet been realized, and the concept of communism may change in the future. Society is developing, and to guide and restrict is dogmatism. Therefore, I venture to suggest abolishing the use of Marxism-Leninism as our guiding ideology, and I hope everyone will correct me.
    Many professors talked about: "Who do we rely on to run the school well?"
    Who do we mainly rely on to run the school well? Is it relying on professors, or relying on inexperienced young Party and League members? Many professors in the Civil Engineering Department feel that the sectarianism of the school Party organization today is mainly manifested in insufficient trust and respect for professors, but too much protection of students and young teachers. The phenomenon of professors having positions without power is still quite serious. Professor Chu Zhongrui said: Older teachers' potential has not been brought into play, and they feel pressure, as if everything has to depend on the new force. Some Party member teaching assistants who have just graduated immediately lead production internships, while experienced teachers act as followers. Professor Tao Baokai heavily pointed out several specific examples and said: The young Party members often disagree with what I want to do. In order to insist on my own opinions, I have to rely on experts to speak to solve the problem. In this case, how can there be a sense of ownership? Many professors feel that the school does not respect their opinions enough on the issues of retaining teaching assistants, further education, and studying abroad. Professor Tao Baokai said: We all want to keep a few teaching assistants with particularly good business skills and train them well, but it is difficult to pass the secretary's level. This year I wanted to keep a teaching assistant. The secretary began to tell me that this person's political conditions were relatively poor, and then made an excuse that our teaching tasks in 1958 were not heavy and we could not keep him. In fact, everyone knows that 1958 is the year when our teaching tasks are the heaviest. In this case, how can we bring apprentices? Associate Professor Xu Baojiu said: Today, the work of the teaching and research group has to go through the secretary's level in everything. I think this is related to the leadership of the Party. I think the Party committee should check, how much power do non-Party members have?
    Sectarianism is also manifested in undemocratic work style. Many professors said that they do not know about the school's development direction, professional settings, and how the school is led. Professor Wang Guozhou said: Many things are done secretly, and we don't even know about the new civil engineering museum, and they say it's confidential. Professor Li Songchen said: We only know where we are going for each production internship one week before we leave, and we haven't discussed it very well. Wang Zhaolin said: This time the rectification is not enough is related to the fact that we don't often speak out freely enough. Usually, we don't know the content before the meeting. When we arrive at the venue, we are given a pile of documents, and the preparer uses a long speech to prove how correct his point of view is. The situation is not introduced in detail, and it is difficult to discuss. Some professors also pointed out that the school affairs committee and the department affairs committee are reduced to formalities, only discussing some trivial matters, in fact, major issues have already been decided.
    Professor Chu Zhongrui also mentioned that the personnel office is all Party members and League members, the organization is huge, there are too many people and not enough work, and the bureaucracy is serious. He said that the cadres in the personnel office regard themselves as special. He had repeatedly asked employees to be able to take three hours a week during office hours to study politics, but they disagreed, but the cadres in the personnel office themselves have two hours of office time every day to study.
    Yang Shide believes that Qian Weichang's opinions on the issue of training goals have many desirable points
    Professor Yang Shide said that the recent discussion on the issue of training goals in higher industrial schools, I think there are shortcomings. Mr. Qian Weichang's opinions on the issue of training goals, regardless of what problems there are, do have many desirable points. I don't think he denied the achievements of learning from the Soviet Union, but many articles published in New Tsinghua always say "we must maintain our line", "we are on the right path." In fact, no one denies our line, but we should carefully study whether we are walking fast enough and whether we have stumbled. The achievements of the past few years are self-evident. Why would an article make the leadership so nervous? If the leadership is really afraid that this will make teachers and students deny the achievements of the past, it is because the leadership has underestimated us.

    清华大学教授继续座谈
    对学校工作中的重要问题展开讨论
    本报讯　清华大学开始整风以来，党委已经邀请教授们分别举行了许多次座谈会，给学校党组织提意见，继续深入进行整风。
    李辑祥说，党委的领导肯定是必要的。金希武认为教授治校是寡头政治。
    不少教授对学校体制提出意见。李辑祥教授说，过去教授治校的办法多由召集人决定一切，不合适。党委的领导肯定是必要的，但是能否设一党派联席机构来帮助党进行工作，起谘询、反映意见、宣传等作用，而校委会起立法与决策的作用。校务代表不妨全面一些，并有常设机构。金希武教授也认为教授治校是寡头政治，学校要依靠老教师，但不必教授治校。他建议党委制领导，扩大校委会，吸收教师、职工参加，并加强校委会决议的权威性，系主任也要有更多的权力。吴仲华教授提出一个改变学校和系领导组织的全面的建议，这就是扩大党委制，由群众选些代表参加党委会共同做领导工作，使其更能代表全校的情况。但这种领导只到系一级，主要是方针的领导。系只要有一位系主任领导和代表全系，另有党总支书记（或称副系主任、系秘书）协助工作，每个专业有代表参加系的工作。要特别加强教研组的作用，使主任真正成为主任，而不是秘书当主任。教研组的秘书可由大家选举，不一定要是党员，党员可以党员的身份在教研组内起作用。王补宣副教授很同意这个意见。郭世康副教授则认为不一定这样做，他提出另一个建议：目前校委会没起作用，可否用选拔优秀干部（包括党与非党派人士）的办法组成。他说，用政协的方式，即照顾各方面的代表的办法是不解决问题的。
    徐璋本说“以马克思主义作为指导思想，一定要产生教条主义。”他建议“取消用马列主义作为指导思想”。
    徐璋本教授说：这里我想谈谈关于教条主义的来源。我认为教条主义的来源与我们的领导思想有关系。
    徐璋本说，他认为以马克思主义作为指导思想，一定要产生教条主义；因为任何学说都是在一定的历史条件下产生的，都有其局限性，若以一种比较固定的学说作为指导思想，就不可避免要犯教条主义。他说，即使一个最聪明的领导者也要犯错误。马列主义的理想是共产主义，但共产主义是全人类的理想，不只是马列主义的理想。印度对崇高理想的追求也很深刻。马列主义的理想也不能仅以政治与经济的内容来包括一切。所以拿马列主义的学说来处理一切矛盾问题就会有问题。有些错误是难免的，有些错误是因为运用马列主义的政治、经济学说而发生的。任何一个学说都不能包括全部的真理。经济与生产是人们自己组成的，因此说经济环境决定人的思想就是教条主义。
    他说，任何矛盾都和前一代的矛盾以及当代的指导思想有关系。马列主义学说是一回事，但要把一切都以此为根据，就会限制了自己。
    他说任何一个学者一个学说都不能把一切好的东西都包括进去。我们要文化发展，光解决人民内部矛盾问题是不够的，一定还要废除以一种学说来指导一切的限制。共产主义还未实现，对共产主义的概念将来可能会有变化，社会正在发展中，要指导要限制就是教条主义。因此我不揣冒昧，建议取消用马列主义作为我们的指导思想，希望大家指正。
    许多教授都谈到：“办好学校依靠谁？”
    办好学校主要依靠谁？是依靠教授，还是依靠缺乏经验的青年党、团员？土木系很多教授感到今天学校党组织的宗派主义主要表现在对教授的信任、尊重不够，而是过多袒护了学生和青年教师。教授有职无权的现象还相当严重。储锺瑞教授说：年长教师潜力未发挥，感到有压力，好像什么事都得看新生力量。有的刚毕业的党员助教马上就带生产实习，有经验的教师反而作跟班。陶葆楷教授沉重地指出几件具体事例说：我要办的事情，年青党员往往不同意，我为了坚持自己的意见，不得不依靠专家来说话才能解决问题，在这种情况下哪有可能有主人翁的感觉。很多教授都觉得学校在留助教、进修、留学等问题方面不够尊重他们意见。陶葆楷教授说：我们都想留几个业务特别好的助教，好好培养，但秘书这一关很难通过。今年我想留一个助教，秘书开始对我说这人政治条件比较差，后来又借口说1958年我们教学任务不重可以不留，其实谁都知道1958年是我们教学任务最重的一年。在这种情况下如何让我们带徒弟呢？许葆玖副教授说：今天教研组工作凡事都得经秘书这一关，我觉得这是与党的领导有关系的。我认为党委领导应检查一下，到底党外人士权有多少？
    宗派主义还表现在作风不民主上，很多教授说他们对学校发展方向、专业设置、学校如何进行领导等事情都不知道。王国周教授说：很多事情都偷偷摸摸，连新建土木馆问题也不让我们知道，还说是保密。李颂琛教授说：每次生产实习都是临走前一周我们才知道是到什么地方去，也没经过很好商量。王兆霖教授说：这次整风大家放得不够是和经常鸣、放不够有关系的。平常开会事前不知道内容，一到会场发一堆文件，准备人又用长时间发言来证明他的论点如何如何正确，情况又不详细介绍，很难讨论。有的教授还指出校务委员会、系务委员会都流于形式，只讨论一些琐事，其实重大问题早就决定好了。
    储锺瑞教授还提到人事室是清一色的党团员，机构庞大，人浮于事，官僚主义严重。他说，人事室干部自视特殊，他以前屡次要求职工每周能在办公时间内抽出三小时学习政治，他们不同意，但人事室干部自己却每人每天有两小时办公时间去学习。
    杨式德认为，钱伟长“关于培养目标问题”的意见有不少可取的地方
    杨式德教授说，最近关于高等工业学校培养目标问题的讨论，我认为是有缺点的。钱伟长先生发表的“关于培养目标问题”意见中，不管有些什么问题，但的确有不少可取的地方。我认为他并没有否定向苏联学习的成绩，可是新清华上登的很多文章，老是说“要维护我们的路线”，“我们是走对了”。其实谁也不否认我们的路线，而是应该仔细研究我们走的快不快，有没有栽跟头。几年来的成绩自有公论，一篇文章为什么就会使领导上这样紧张呢？假使领导上真的怕因此会使教师同学否定过去的成绩，那是因为领导上把我们估计过低的缘故。
