The socialist ideological education movement launched in rural Shanxi Province is an important measure to correctly understand and handle the contradictions among the people in rural areas.

New Situations and New Contradictions

According to the "Decision on Strengthening Ideological Work" issued by the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China on February 23rd, the purpose of carrying out this education movement is to enable the broad masses of people to distinguish between right and wrong and between the enemy and ourselves, to educate the masses and improve leadership, to further strengthen the ties between the Party and the people, to mobilize all positive factors to overcome all negative factors, to promote the fine traditions of hard work and thrift in building the country, and to promote this year's agricultural bumper harvest campaign. Based on the spirit of this decision, the local and county committees of the CPC analyzed the ideological trends of the people of all strata and within the Party through typical investigations and materials collected at ordinary times. They discovered new situations and new contradictions in rural areas, and further realized that some abnormal ideological emotions and practical problems existing in the work were growing in rural areas, which needed to be solved urgently.

These problems are mainly reflected in the following four aspects: the relationship between workers and peasants; the relationship of interests among the state, agricultural cooperatives, and members; within agricultural cooperatives, the relationships of interests between the cooperative and members, production teams and production teams, members and members, leaders and the led; the struggle between socialist ideology and the remnants of capitalist ideology. Regarding these new problems, both leaders and the led lacked correct understanding and handling methods, which urgently needed to be resolved. From conveying and discussing the decision of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the CPC and investigating and studying the actual situation, the leadership organs at all levels gradually clarified that the contradictions among the people and erroneous ideas in rural areas are an objectively existing social phenomenon that cannot be covered up. Persuasion and education of the people and checking leadership to improve work should be adopted to solve the problems properly.

The socialist ideological education movement launched in rural Shanxi Province at the end of February was based on the above reasons. At present, this movement has been universally launched throughout the province. Generally, the local committees transmit the Provincial Committee's decision from top to bottom, first within the Party and then outside the Party, and deeply conduct ideological mobilization. They also briefly train 1.3 million Party members, members of the Communist Youth League, propagandists, and non-Party activists in short-term training courses at the county or township level. Relying on this group of propaganda forces, they launch extensive propaganda activities among the people. The content of the propaganda mainly focuses on conducting education on socialism, collectivism, patriotism, and the worker-peasant alliance, in connection with the ideas of the masses and actual examples. In many areas, adult peasants who have received this education account for 70% to 90% of the total adult population in rural areas.

Three Types

The progress of the movement throughout the province is uneven and can be roughly divided into three types.

The first type is the method adopted by the Shuguang Agricultural Cooperative in Zhangqing Township, Yuci County. This method involves a work team sent by the leadership organ to first conduct a preliminary investigation of the situation, problems, and ideological trends of people of all strata in the cooperative. Based on this situation, they make a report to the members centered on "building a new socialist countryside." Then, they let go of democracy and let the members put forward all their opinions, criticisms, and requirements. They then adopt the method of mass self-education and conduct democratic discussions under leadership. Finally, the leadership summarizes the results of the mass discussions and reports to the masses again, solving what can be solved, explaining the situations that the masses do not understand, and criticizing what is wrong. This method is used by a small number of units throughout the province, but it solves problems more thoroughly and is beneficial to educating the masses, improving leadership, strengthening unity within the cooperative, and strengthening the relationship between the Party and the masses.

The second type is the method adopted by Pingshun County to combine positive socialist propaganda, mobilizing the masses for discussion, and striving for a bumper harvest this year. In the movement, positive propaganda is the main focus in connection with the ideas of the masses, while checking leadership and improving work. Based on the pre-investigated situation, the county uses methods such as making reports, holding forums, recalling comparisons, and organizing visits to improve the awareness of the masses and solve some practical problems, and work has also been improved. However, when adopting this method, some places have shown a tendency to only pay attention to positive propaganda and ignore the development of democracy. Some places even one-sidedly regard the movement as only criticizing the wrong ideas of the masses, without checking leadership to improve work, resulting in poor results.

The third type is simply carrying out positive propaganda, compiling and printing propaganda materials, and conducting positive propaganda through reporters and propagandists. The content of the propaganda is also limited to the education of the superiority of agricultural cooperation. Without mobilizing the masses and with insufficient democracy, it is not easy to detect the shortcomings and errors in leadership and work. The general situation in the province is that the second type mentioned above is more common, while the first and third types are less common.

Initial Achievements

After more than a month of socialist ideological education movement, initial results have been achieved.

First of all, the vast number of rural cadres and peasants have a further understanding of the advanced socialist system of agricultural production cooperatives. Before the movement, a considerable number of cooperatives that had reduced production due to natural disasters or poor management, and members whose income had temporarily decreased, had various doubts and misunderstandings about agricultural cooperatives. Without analyzing the specific situations and reasons, they listened to the words of some wealthy middle peasants and attributed other reasons for production reduction to the establishment of agricultural cooperatives. After self-education through recollection and comparative discussion, the members of these cooperatives realized that if they were to engage in individual and decentralized production, the reduction in production and income would be even more severe than in agricultural cooperatives if they encountered natural disasters like last year. They also realized that "it is inevitable that there is a lack of experience in the first year of running the cooperative and that there are some shortcomings in the cooperative, as long as we perseveringly run the cooperative, the shortcomings can be overcome." The number of farmers in Wanrong County who requested to withdraw from the cooperative decreased from 108 before the movement to 23. Furthermore, 250 former individual farmers in this county expressed their determination to take the road of collectivization.

Secondly, through the education of accounting and comparison in the movement, many peasants have once again received education on the correct relationship between the individual, the collective, and the state, and on the worker-peasant alliance. In the past, some peasants complained that the state favored workers, saying that "workers have a good life, peasants have a hard life"; in terms of work attitude, some peasants only cared about earning work points in the cooperative, regardless of the quality of labor. The branch of the CPC in Pen Village Township, Yangqu County, helped peasants specifically calculate the two accounts of the state's support for the township and the peasants' contributions to the state. The result proved that the agricultural tax paid by the entire township to the state only accounted for 20% of the total amount of soil and water conservation loans and disaster relief funds provided by the state to the township. After calculating the account of the gradual improvement of the peasants' lives, the peasants in this township said: "Originally, we were only talking about one side of the truth. It is not that the state does not care, and the peasants' lives have not improved. It is that our demands are too high and too urgent." "It is wrong to only want to improve life and not be willing to work hard in production." After the education of accounting and comparison in Pingshun County, the county's repayment of state loans increased from 20% of the total loans to 85%, and savings deposits increased by 150,000 yuan. A new atmosphere of loving the cooperative as home, working hard and uniting in production, and saving food has also emerged throughout the county.

Thirdly, after the propaganda of "thinking of all possible ways to strive for a bumper harvest this year," the ideological obstacles to carrying out the agricultural bumper harvest campaign began to be cleared, and the enthusiasm of the masses for production was enhanced. In Wutai County, 340 cooperatives revised their original low production plans for this year. The peasants described the revised plan as: changing the plan for reducing production into a plan for increasing production. The Changtiaopo New Agricultural Cooperative in this county, after finding ways and measures to increase production, changed the plan of an average yield of 167 catties per mu to 204 catties. The daily attendance rate of the entire cooperative has also increased from 55% of the total labor force to 85%, and a spring plowing production competition has been launched. In Xiangyuan County, the masses put forward more than 1,300 suggestions for striving for a bumper harvest this year during the movement.

Fourthly, in areas where the movement was carried out better, democracy was fully developed, and members put forward many opinions criticizing the leadership and improving work. The most common opinion of the members of the agricultural cooperatives in Pingshun County on the cooperative cadres was that they participated in too little labor production and there was insufficient democratic consultation. Among the more than 300 opinions put forward by the peasants in Yangwei Township during the movement, more than 60 were criticisms of the style of the cadres. The Party branch of this township accepted the criticism from the masses, analyzed and studied it at the branch meeting, and conducted self-criticism for the correct criticism from the masses. Many Party branches throughout the county educated Party members based on the opinions put forward by the masses. According to the statistics of 321 township cadres and 420 cooperative cadres, the number of days each person participated in labor before March increased four times compared to the same period last year. The members said: In the past, township and cooperative cadres held meetings at night and slept during the day. Now, they talk at night and work during the day, personally going to the fields to guide production.

New Arrangements for Continuing to Deepen the Movement

At the recent Provincial Propaganda Work Conference of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, Chairman Mao's speeches at the Supreme State Conference on "Correctly Handling Contradictions Among the People" and at the National Propaganda Work Conference were conveyed. Based on the spirit of Chairman Mao's speeches, the conference studied the situation and existing problems of the socialist ideological education movement in the province, and made new arrangements on how to continue to deepen the socialist ideological education movement step by step in the future. The conference decided that the development of the movement should be closely combined with production and work, and should not be restricted by the original decision to end at the end of June. It was also stipulated that this movement must improve the awareness of the people by strengthening ideological education and expanding democracy, overcome bureaucracy, so as to correctly resolve the contradictions among the people in rural areas, further strengthen the ties between the Party and the people, and promote the agricultural bumper harvest campaign this year.

    山西省农村的社会主义思想宣传运动
    马明
    山西省农村展开的社会主义思想宣传运动，是正确地认识和处理农村中人民内部矛盾问题的一项重要措施。
    新情况新矛盾
    按照中共山西省委2月23日关于加强党的思想工作的决定，开展这次宣传运动的目的，是要使广大人民群众分清是非界限和敌我界限，教育群众和改进领导，进一步密切党和人民群众的联系，调动一切积极因素克服一切消极因素，发扬艰苦奋斗、勤俭建国的优良传统，推动今年的农业丰产运动的开展。依据这个决定的精神，中共各地方和县委员会从典型调查和平时占有的材料中，分析了各阶层人民和党内的思想动向，发现了农村中出现的新情况和新矛盾，并且进一步认识到目前农村中正在滋长着一些不正常的思想情绪和工作中存在的实际问题。
    这些问题主要反映在以下四个方面：工人和农民的关系；国家、农业社和社员三者之间的利益关系；在农业社内部又表现在社和社员、生产队和生产队、社员和社员、领导和被领导之间的利益关系；社会主义思想和资本主义残余思想的斗争。对待这些新的问题，不论领导或者被领导都缺乏正确的认识和处理办法，急待加以解决。各级领导机关从传达、讨论中共山西省委的决定和对实际情况的调查研究中，逐渐明确了农村中的人民内部矛盾和错误思想是一种客观存在的社会现象，不能把它掩盖起来，应该采取耐心地向人民群众进行说服教育和检查领导改进工作的办法，来加以妥善的解决。
    山西省农村从2月底开始的社
  会主义思想宣传运动，就是基于以上原因展开的。目前这个运动已经在全省范围内普遍展开。各地一般
  是自上而下、先党内后党外传达省
  委的决定，和深入地进行思想发动，并且以县或乡为单位短期集训了党员、团员、宣传员和非党积极分子一百三十万人，依靠这批宣传力量在人民群众中展开广泛的宣传活动。宣传的内容主要是联系群众思想和实际事例，进行社会主义、集体主义、爱国主义和工农联盟的教育。受到这种教育的成年农民，在许多地区已经占到农村成年人口总数的70％至90％。
    三种类型
    全省运动的进展是不平衡的，大体可分三种类型。
    第一种如榆次县张庆乡曙光农业社的办法。这种办法是由领导机关派往这个社的工作组，首先对社里的情况、问题和各阶层人民的思想动向进行初步的调查，根据这种情况向社员作一次以“建设社会主义新农村”为中心内容的报告。接着放手发扬民主，让社员把所有的意见、批评和要求都提出来，然后采取群众自我教育的方式，有领导地进行民主讨论。最后由领导上把群众讨论的结果集中起来，向群众再作报告，能解决的加以解决，群众不了解的情况和不能解决的问题加以说明，错误的加以批判。采取这种办法的在全省属于少数单位，但是解决问题比较彻底，对教育群众和改进领导、加强社内团结、密切党和群众的关系，都有好处。
    第二种是平顺县采取正面进行社会主义宣传、发动群众讨论和争取今年农业丰收相结合的办法。在运动中联系群众思想以正面宣传为主，同时检查领导，改进工作。这个县根据事前调查的情况以社为单位，用作报告、座谈、回忆对比和组织参观等方法，提高了群众的觉悟，解决了一些实际问题，对工作也有改进。但是在采用这种办法的时候，有的地方发生了只注意正面宣传、忽视发扬民主的偏向。有的地方甚至把运动片面地只看做批评群众的错误思想，而不去检查领导改进工作，收效较差。
    第三种是只单纯地进行了正面宣传，编印了宣传材料，通过报告员和宣传员进行正面的宣传；宣传内容也局限于农业合作化优越性的教育。没有发动群众，发扬民主也很不够，不容易察觉领导上和工作中的缺点和错误。全省总的情况是上述第二种情况多，第一种、第三种情况少。
    初获成绩
    经过一个多月的社会主义思想的宣传运动，已经取得初步成效。
    首先是广大农村干部和农民对农业生产合作社这种先进的社会主义制度，有了进一步的了解。运动开展以前，有相当一部分因为自然灾害或经营管理不善而减产的社和暂时减少收入的社员，对农业社发生了种种怀疑和误解。他们对具体情况和原因不加分析，听信一些富裕中农的话，把其他减产原因都说成是办农业社的结果。这些社的社员在经过回忆、对比讨论的自我教育以后，认识到如果是单干分散生产的话，遇到去年那样的自然灾害，减产、减收比办农业社还会严重，还认识到“头一年办社缺乏经验、社里有些缺点是难免的，只要坚韧地办社，缺点是可以克服的。”万荣县要求退社的农民由运动前的一百零八户，减至二十三户。这个县并且有二百五十户原来的个体农民表示坚决要走合作化的道路。
    其次，在运动中通过算账对比的教育，不少农民又受到一次个人、集体与国家三者的正确关系的教育和工农联盟的教育。过去有些农民埋怨国家偏待工人，说“工人生活好，农民生活苦”；在劳动态度上，有些农民只顾在社内赚工分，不管劳动质量。中共阳曲县盆上乡支部帮助农民具体计算国家支援这个乡和这个乡的农民对国家贡献的两笔账的结果，证明全乡向国家交纳的农业税，只占到国家对这个乡水土保持贷款和受灾生活救济款总数的20％。这个乡的农民又计算了农民生活逐年提高的账以后说：“原来咱是只说的一面道理，不是国家不关心，农民生活也不是没有提高，而是咱要求的过高过急。”“只想改善生活、不愿勤劳生产是不对的。”平顺县经过算账对比的教育以后，全县归还国家贷款的由原来占贷款总数的20％，增至85％，并且增加存款十五万元。全县还出现了爱社如家、勤劳团结生产、节约粮食的新气象。
    第三，经过“想尽一切办法，争取今年农业大丰收”的宣传以后，为开展农业丰产运动开始扫除了思想障碍，提高了群众的生产积极性。五台县有三百四十个社修改了原来偏低的今年生产计划，农民形容这次修改的计划是：变减产的计划为增产的计划。这个县的长条坡乡新建农业社经过寻找增产门路和增产措施，将每亩平均产一百六十七斤的计划，改为二百零四斤。全社每日的出勤率，也由过去占劳动力总数的55％，增加到85％，并且展开了春耕生产竞赛。襄垣县在运动中，群众提出了争取今年农业大丰收的献计达一千三百多条。
    第四，在运动开展比较好的地区，充分发扬了民主，社员们提出了不少批评领导和改进工作的意见。平顺县农业社的社员们对社干部最多的意见是劳动生产太少，民主商量不够。杨威乡农民在运动中提出的三百多条意见中，有六十多条是批评干部作风的问题。这个乡的党支部接受了群众的批评，在支部会上进行了分析研究，对群众的正确批评进行了自我检讨。全县许多党支部根据群众提出的意见教育了党员。据三百二十一个乡干部和四百二十个社干部的统计，3月份以前每人参加劳动日的数字，比去年同期提高了四倍。社员说：过去乡社干部是黑夜开会，白天睡觉，现在是黑夜说白天干，亲自上地指导生产了。
    继续深入开展运动的新部署
    中共山西省委员会最近召开的全省宣传工作会议上，传达了毛主席在最高国务会议关于“正确地处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的讲话和在全国宣传工作会议上的讲话。会议根据毛主席讲话的精神，研究了全省开展社会主义思想宣传运动的情况和存在的问题，并且对今后如何继续深入地有步骤地开展社会主义思想的宣传运动作了新的部署。会议决定开展运动要和生产、工作密切结合，不受原来决定的6月底结束的限制。并且规定这一运动必须通过加强思想教育和扩大民主的方法，提高人民群众的觉悟，克服官僚主义，以便正确地解决农村中的人民内部矛盾，进一步密切党和人民群众的联系，推动今年农业丰产运动。
