Senior Intellectuals in the Ministry of Water Resources
Criticize Abnormal Party-Masses Relations

    (Our dispatch) The Party Group of the Ministry of Water Resources of the Chinese Communist Party held three symposiums for senior intellectuals within the ministry on the afternoons of the 16th, 18th, and 21st. At the meetings, many people criticized the abnormal Party-masses relations within the Ministry of Water Resources. Participants included non-Party democratic figures: Vice Minister Zhang Hanying, Deputy Director of the General Office Cui Zaizhi, Deputy Director of the Survey and Design Bureau Liu Xueying, Deputy Director of the Engineering Management Bureau Liu Derun, Deputy Director of the Hydrology Bureau Cai Zhen, Deputy Director of the Farmland Water Conservancy Bureau Zhi Nanping, Director of the Technical Committee Gao Jingying, Chief of the Finance Section of the Planning and Finance Department Fan Zhen, and engineers Yuan Suxin, Yu Shufang, Lu Keming, Li Jie, Sun Fushi, Bian Wenzhuang, Yao Hongru, Qi Ziren, Wang Wenqi, and Liu Naichen; members of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang: Assistant Minister Liu Yaozhang, Deputy Director of the Farmland Water Conservancy Bureau Yan Youwen, Guan Wenqi, and engineer Wang Huixian; members of the Jiusan Society: engineer Hao Feng'an, etc.

    When discussing Party-masses relations, Hao Feng'an said: Some Party members have privileged thinking and speak in a condescending tone; they also demand special treatment in life. For example, some Party members insist on living in certain houses, and the general affairs department can't do anything about it, while I moved three times in two days when I came to the Ministry of Water Resources.

    Liu Xueying said: Before the Three-Anti Campaign, I was very active and proactively associated with Party members, wanting to learn from them, and visited their homes a lot. After several movements, I only go to two doors now: besides the ministry's main gate, there's only my own home. This is because the Party didn't do a good job in the aftermath of the movements, making us feel like the "movements" never end. Therefore, I only speak three-tenths of what I'm thinking to people, afraid that I'm still being investigated. I also dare not approach non-Party comrades because I don't know how the Party views them, whether they are still being investigated.

    Guan Wenqi said: The United Front work of the Ministry of Water Resources is not too bad, but it's not broad enough. It's very respectful to higher-ups like Minister Fu and Assistant Minister Liu, but not necessarily to those below.

    He believes that there is not only a wall between the Party and non-Party members, but also between everyone. This is of course not caused by any one Party member, but is related to all aspects.

    Wang Huixian believes that non-Party cadres are "loyal but not close" to the Party organization, while some Party members are "authoritative but lack affection" towards the non-Party masses. He said: I see many non-Party cadres who are very loyal to the cause of national construction, and also loyal to the organization and the Party, but they don't get the same attention as Party members despite working just as loyally, and gradually feel distant.

     "Loyal but not close" is two-sided. One aspect is that the person doesn't strive to get the organization's concern, and the other aspect is that the Party organization doesn't fully believe what these people say; or they don't trust him because of a bad history, and adopt a cold and distant attitude. The Communist Party is the ruling party, and should bear more responsibility for this phenomenon. Some Party members are very "authoritative" in their attitude, language, or when judging right and wrong and commenting on work, making people feel that affection is lacking and that they cannot combine kindness with strictness. I hope that these phenomena can be changed through the rectification campaign.

    Cui Zaizhi said: I support the leadership of the Party Group. However, due to the simplified leadership style of the Party Group, it sometimes becomes a situation where the Party replaces the government, and non-Party leading comrades cannot truly have authority commensurate with their position. Many things are discussed and decided in the Party Group, and some are discussed in a formalistic way at the ministerial meetings, while some are not discussed at the ministerial meetings at all. Many non-Party comrades don't know about changes in organizational structure or increases and decreases in plans, so naturally they cannot implement them well.

    Sun Fushi said: Some people in the newspapers suggest that the school affairs committee should lead the school and the Party organization should withdraw, which is not appropriate. He said: If it weren't for the leadership of the Communist Party, China wouldn't be what it is today. It may feel uncomfortable for intellectuals when the Communist Party leads strictly, but it still feels sweet after thinking about it.

    Qi Ziren believes that the Ministry of Water Resources' use of engineering and technical personnel, especially senior engineers, is inappropriate and does not conform to the spirit of the central government. He said: I studied in China's first school specializing in water conservancy, and I have never left water conservancy work since I graduated. I have been doing it for more than 30 years, and I am confident that I still have some ability. But I have never been used well. This spring, I was sick for more than two months. After I recovered, Director Jiang asked me to have a personal talk and encouraged me to retire. I don't know how the country uses people. There are also people older than me working in the water conservancy department, and I only took two months of leave this year, so must I retire? Now the country doesn't have too many engineering and technical personnel, but too few. It's very painful for me to be asked to retire. I can still contribute to building socialism!

    In addition, Liu Yaozhang, Yuan Suxin, and others also offered opinions.

    At the meeting, Li Baohua, Secretary of the Party Group of the Ministry of Water Resources, said that he hoped everyone would speak freely, and that there would only be benefits and no harm in speaking frankly.

### 水利部高级知识分子  对党群关系不正常的现象提出批评

    水利部高级知识分子
    对党群关系不正常的现象提出批评
    本报讯　中共水利部党组在16日、18日、21日三天下午召开了三次部内高级知识分子座谈会，会上很多人对水利部党群关系不正常提出了批评。参加座谈会的有无党派民主人士：副部长张含英、办公厅副主任崔载之、勘测设计局副局长刘学濴、工程管理局副局长刘德润、水文局副局长蔡振、农田水利局副局长智南屏、技术委员会主任高镜莹、计划财务司财务处长樊真和工程师原素欣、俞漱芳、陆克铭、李捷、孙辅世、卞文庄、姚鸿儒、齐子仁、王文骐、刘鼐臣；民革成员：部长助理刘瑶章、农田水利局副局长阎又文、关文启和工程师王恢先；九三学社成员：工程师郝丰庵等。
    在谈到党群关系的时候，郝丰庵说：有些党员有特权思想，说话的口气都高人一等；生活上也闹特殊，如有的党员硬住房子，总务部门没办法，而我来水利部时两天就搬了三次家。
    刘学荣说：三反以前，我自己很积极很主动地同党员在一起，想学习他们，各家串门子很多。经过几次运动之后，我现在只走两个门了：除了部里的大门之外，就只有自己家的大门。这是党对运动的善后工作没有作好，使我们感到“运动”起来就没有个完。因此，只好见人三分话，怕还在审查我。和非党同志也不敢接近，因为不知道党对他怎样看法，是不是还在审查他。
    关文启说：水利部的统战工作也不太坏，但是面不广。对上层像傅部长、刘部长助理这些人是很尊重的，但是对下面就不一定。
    他认为不仅党与非党之间有墙，人人之间都有。这当然并不是那一个党员造成的，而是各方面都有关系。
    王恢先认为非党干部对党组织是“忠而不亲”，部分党员对非党群众则是“威重情薄”。他说：我看到很多非党干部对国家建设事业非常忠心，也忠心于组织、忠于党，但是和党员一样忠心工作却得不到同样重视，慢慢地就感到不亲了。
      “忠而不亲”是两面的，本人不去争取组织关心是一面，另一面党组织对于这些人的话也不全信；或是由于历史不好，就不信任他，采取冷淡疏远态度。共产党是执政党，对这种现象应负的责任就要多一些。部分党员同志很“威严”，态度上，语言上，或是评判是非、评论工作的时候，使人感到情感很薄，不能恩威相济。这些现象希望通过整风能够改变。
    崔载之说：对党组的领导我是拥护的。但由于党组领导方式简单化，有时便形成以党代政，非党领导同志不能真正做到有职有权。许多事在党组就讨论好了，有的拿到部务会议形式上讨论一下，有的根本不拿到部务会议上讨论。像组织机构的变动、计划的增减，很多非党同志都不知道，自然没法好好贯彻执行。
    孙辅世说：报纸上有些人提出校务委员会领导学校，党组织退出，这样不合适。他说：要不是共产党领导，中国不会有今天这个样子。共产党领导严格些，对知识分子来说当时可能感到不舒服，过后回味一下还是很甜蜜的。
    齐子仁认为水利部对工程技术人员，特别是老的工程师，使用不当，不符合中央精神。他说：我是在中国第一个专门讲水利的学校里学习的，我从毕业后一直没离开过水利工作，做了三十多年，我自信还有一些能力。但却一直没得很好使用。今年春天，我病了两个多月，病好了蒋局长叫我去个别谈话，动员我退休。我不知道国家是怎样用人的。现在比我老的人在水利部门工作的也有，我就是今年才请了两个月假，难道就非退休不可吗？现在国家的工程技术人员不是太多而是太少。叫我退休，我非常痛苦。我还能为建设社会主义出一份力量呢！
    此外，刘瑶章、原素欣等也都提了意见。
    会上，水利部党组书记李葆华表示希望大家畅所欲言，有意见就讲，话讲透了只有好处没有坏处。
