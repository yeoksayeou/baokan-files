Under the leadership of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), more than three million Japanese workers launched a spring struggle this year to demand improved treatment. However, in early April, the Japanese government decided to punish union leaders who participated in this struggle, which in turn triggered protests from workers in various regions. On May 11th and 12th, workers from the Japan National Railway Workers' Union and the National Railway Locomotive Engineers' Union, among others, held a power struggle to oppose the government's illegal punishment of union leaders who participated in the spring struggle.

The picture shows workers at Tabata Station in Tokyo participating in the strike on May 11th.

    在日本工会总评议会领导下，日本三百多万工人今年春季展开了要求提高待遇的春季斗争。但是日本政府在4月初却决定处分参加这次斗争的工会干部，因此又引起各地工人的抗议。5月11日、12日两天，日本国营铁道工会和国营铁道机车工会等的工人，举行反对政府非法处分参加春季斗争的工会干部的实力斗争。
