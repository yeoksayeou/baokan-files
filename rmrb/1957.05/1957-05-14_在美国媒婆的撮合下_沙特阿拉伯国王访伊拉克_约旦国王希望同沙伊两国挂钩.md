Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Saudi Arabian King Saud flew from Riyadh to Baghdad on May 11 for a formal visit to Iraq. Saud will hold talks with Iraqi King Faisal.

The Saudi and Iraqi Hashemite royal families have a long-standing feud, and relations between the two countries have always been very distant. Recently, the United States has been trying to isolate Egypt, promote the "Eisenhower Doctrine," and has been working hard to mediate, bringing these two countries closer. It is reported that Lebanese President Camille Chamoun has also been involved in facilitating this. As a result, this visit and talks to "improve relations" were arranged. At the same time, it is said that Jordanian King Hussein is also eager to form an alliance among Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Jordan, the three monarchies, in a "common defense front." During his hasty visit to Riyadh after the Jordan incident, he exchanged views with Saudi Arabian King Saud on this matter. According to Western news agencies, Hussein is likely to visit Baghdad in the next two days to participate in the talks between Saud and Faisal.

There are also reports that Lebanese President Camille Chamoun will also lead a delegation to participate in the talks. However, according to the Indian Press Trust from Beirut, Lebanon is currently busy preparing for the general election to be held in early June, and Chamoun is unlikely to visit Baghdad at this time. It is believed that the heads of these four countries will probably meet immediately after the Lebanese elections.

    在美国媒婆的撮合下
    沙特阿拉伯国王访伊拉克
    约旦国王希望同沙伊两国挂钩
    据新华社讯　沙特阿拉伯国王沙特5月11日乘飞机从利雅得到巴格达，对伊拉克进行正式访问。沙特将同伊拉克国王费萨尔举行会谈。
    沙特王室同伊拉克的哈希姆王室原有宿仇，两国之间的关系一向很疏远。最近以来，美国企图孤立埃及，推销“艾森豪威尔主义”，竭力从中撮合，使这两个国家接近。有消息说，黎巴嫩总统夏蒙也从中进行疏通。结果才安排了这次“改进关系”的访问和会谈。同时，据说约旦国王侯赛因也迫切希望使沙特阿拉伯、伊拉克和约旦这三个同是君主制的国家在“共同防御阵线”中结成联盟。他在约旦事件后匆匆访问利雅得的时候，就曾经同沙特阿拉伯国王交换了这方面的意见。据西方通讯社报道，侯赛因很可能在最近两天内到巴格达参加沙特同费萨尔的会谈。
    还有消息说，黎巴嫩总统夏蒙也将率领代表团参加这次会谈。但是，据印度报业托辣斯自贝鲁特报道，黎巴嫩目前正在紧张地筹备6月初就要举行的大选，夏蒙不大可能会在现在访问巴格达。人们认为在黎巴嫩选举后这四个国家的首脑大概会马上开会。
