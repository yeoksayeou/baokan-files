Let Members Supervise Finances at Any Time
                He Zhixian
    The Xinghua Agricultural Production Cooperative in Zhaiqi Township, Tonglu County, Zhejiang Province, is a large cooperative formed by the merger of four small cooperatives in October last year. After the merger, the number of members increased significantly, and the financial work became more onerous. However, this cooperative was able to improve financial management without increasing the number of accounting staff compared to the small cooperatives, and was able to publish accounts to members on time. How was this achieved?
    Financial Chaos, Passive Leadership
    Among the four small cooperatives that preceded Xinghua Cooperative, the Qiancun and Xinghua cooperatives had better financial work. Xu Xuezhang, an accountant and Communist Party member of Qiancun Cooperative, was even named a model accountant for the entire county in 1956. However, these four small cooperatives had a common shortcoming in their financial work, namely that the financial system at the time did not allow members to supervise financial income and expenditure at any time, which led to continuous chaos.
    One of the problems with these cooperatives at the time was that the accounting announcement periods were too far apart, and the announcement of accounts became a mere formality. The practice at the time was to list the cooperative's agricultural and sideline income and expenditure figures in a table each month and announce them to the members of each team; however, the members did not know the amount of work points, investment, advance payments, and loans they had received. Only during the four distribution seasons of spring flowers, early rice, middle rice, and year-end settlement did the cooperative hand over the "Detailed Household Financial Accounts" to the team, which was then orally announced to the members by the team work point recorder. In this way, although the cooperative's income and expenditure accounts were announced, there was no basis for mutual checking between the cooperative and the team, as well as within the team, and the figures were very general, so members had no way of knowing whether the accounts were wrong. If there were errors, they could not be discovered and corrected in a timely manner. Over time, the accounts became difficult to clarify. For example, in August last year, Xu Tugeng, a member of the third team of Qiancun Cooperative, pre-borrowed a pair of baskets from the cooperative, but the accountant recorded it under the name of Xu Shigen of the second team, which was only discovered when the year-end distribution plan was announced. Some members said that this was "an account of conscience," and that recording more or less depended on the accountant's conscience. Those members who found that their accounts had been recorded incorrectly accused the accountant, saying, "We worked hard all year, but in the end we only got this muddled account." Therefore, even though there were only a few mistakes in the entire cooperative, the members were "on edge," and everyone was suspicious, coming to the accounting office to check and reconcile accounts, with nearly a hundred people coming to check accounts on the busiest days. The accountants, on the other hand, felt that they were "putting in a lot of effort but not getting any credit" and "being wronged." It took half a day at least, and two or three days at most, to check a single error, which exhausted the accountants.
    The over-concentration of the approval authority for advance payments and loans also caused financial chaos and busy work for the cadres. Before the merger, the Qiancun and Xinghua cooperatives implemented a system of advance payments based on labor, but without a fixed period. The Wuyi and Xinzhuang cooperatives did not have an advance payment system. The common practice of these four cooperatives for advance payments was that the cooperative directly issued the money to the members. As for households that wanted to borrow money, they all had to be approved by the cooperative director with a seal, and the accounting office made the payment. The members believed that "advance payments and loans are just asking the cooperative director for money," and even regarded getting money as "earning wages." In addition, the cooperative director had a patronizing view and approved large amounts of loans and advance payments. As a result, households that did a lot of work did not get advance payments, or got very little. They said, "Now, as long as you know how to argue, you can ask for as much as you want, and the cooperative director puts his seal on it, and you can just reach out and get the money." These people's production enthusiasm was not high. Some members who received money did not have strict control over it, and some had very little left after deductions at the end of the year; some even owed money. Some members used the money they received to buy wine and meat, and spent it recklessly. The cooperative director, accountant, and cashier were busy all day dealing with approving notes and paying money.
    How to Resolve the Contradictions
    After the merger, Xu Xuezhang, the accountant of the Qiancun Cooperative, was elected as the chief accountant of the Xinghua Agricultural Cooperative. He was troubled by the problems of the past. Previously, the Qiancun Cooperative had only 403 households, and three full-time cadres (two accountants and one cashier) were engaged in financial work, and they were still busy and dizzy; now there were 753 households, and the number of accounting staff had not increased. How could they complete the task? He thought back and forth. Later, he realized that some errors were discovered by the members during the year-end settlement, weren't they? If the system was changed so that members could supervise the accounts and discover problems at any time, wouldn't that be easier?
    He brought up his ideas at the Party branch committee meeting. The township general branch secretary and the branch, who worked in this cooperative, supported his opinion. After a detailed discussion on this issue, the branch committee made a decision.
    Based on the decision of the branch, Xinghua Cooperative has, since January of this year, implemented the monthly public disclosure of the cooperative's financial income accounts and the members' detailed accounts of work points, investment, repayment of investment, advance payments, and loans, and established a chain accounting system between the cooperative and the team, between the cooperative and the members, and between the team and the members (for example, the labor work point figures must be consistent between the detailed accounts in the members' labor manuals and the team's detailed work point accounts, and the total work point accounts of the cooperative, the team, and the members must be consistent; for example, for investment and loan accounts, the cooperative's detailed household accounts must be consistent with the detailed household accounts of the members issued to the team on a monthly basis). The method of announcing the accounts is: at the end of each month, the work point recorder of each team registers each item of the full month's work points, advance payments, loans, investment, and repayment of investment for each household of the team, and sends them to the cooperative's accounting office along with the "Household Announcement Form." After the accountant fills them in the cooperative's books, the two forms are returned to each team for verification.
    Another improvement is the implementation of a hierarchical management system for advance payments and loans. The cooperative only controls the total proportion of advance payments and loans of each brigade, and the members' advance payments and loans are directly controlled by the brigade (the cooperative's main sideline occupation - making grass paper - is produced by the brigade). The specific method is: 30% of the sideline income is used as the brigade's labor-based advance payment, 15% is used as loan amount (one brigade, because of economic difficulties, is allowed to have a slightly larger proportion of advance payment), and the remaining part of the sideline income is handed over to the cooperative for unified use. When the brigade (or team) deals with the members' loan issues, it must be discussed democratically by the members.
    In order to enable the teams and members to supervise the cooperative's finances and the expenses of each team, the cooperative announces the agricultural production expenses of each team (including the fertilizer, agricultural tools repair and replenishment expenses, etc. received by the team from the cooperative) and the amount of sideline income submitted on a quarterly basis.
    The implementation of the new system will inevitably increase the workload of the team's work point recorders. To this end, the Party branch convened a meeting of work point recorders to educate them to improve their sense of responsibility, and the cooperative's accountant led them to learn new accounting methods. The cooperative subsidized the work point recorders with a small number of work points to compensate them for the loss of work caused by accounting.
    After the implementation of the new financial system, the number of people requesting loans decreased, and the amount of loans also decreased. For example, member Shu Abin, with a family of five and two and a half laborers, blindly spent money last year, and at the end of the year, he owed the cooperative 63 yuan. In the past few months of this year, he has been frugal with his money, and by the end of March, he had only borrowed two yuan. The members are very satisfied with this practice. Everyone believes that there are three main benefits to doing so: first, it eliminates doubts, and everyone no longer has to worry about "the cooperative's big accounts being difficult to clear," and they are wholeheartedly and actively engaged in production; second, advance payments and loans are decided by the members themselves through discussion, and there is no longer the employer's viewpoint of "taking wages from the cooperative director"; at the same time, everyone knows how much money the team can advance and borrow, and they earnestly supervise to ensure reasonable use; third, because the accounts are clear, the emotions of complaint and suspicion of the cooperative cadres caused by financial chaos in the past have been eliminated among the members, and the unity between the cadres and the members has been strengthened. The cooperative cadres are freed from the passive situation of dealing with advance payments and loans and can use more energy to lead production.

    让社员有可能随时监督财务
                何志贤
    浙江省桐庐县窄溪乡星华农业生产合作社，是去年10月由四个小社合并而成的大社。合并以后，社员户数大大增加了，财务工作更加繁重了。但是，这个社却能在不比小社增加会计人员的条件下，改善财务管理，作到按时向社员公布账目。这是怎样做到的呢？
    财务混乱，领导被动
    星华社前身的四个小社中，前村、星华两社财务工作较好。前村社的会计、共产党员徐学章同志，曾被评为全县1956年度的模范会计。但是，这四个小社在财务工作上有一个共同的缺点，就是当时的财务制度使得社员不能随时监督财务收支情况，因此不断发生一些混乱现象。
    这几个社当时的问题之一是账目公布期相隔过长，公布账目流于形式。当时的做法是：把全社的农业副业收支数字每月列成表格，到各小队向社员公布；社员对于自己所得的工分、投资、预支、借支的金额却不知道。只是到春花、早稻、中稻、年终决算等四个分配季节，社才把社的“分户财务明细账”交给小队，由小队记工员以口头方式向社员公布。这样，全社收支账目虽然公布了，但是没有一个可以使社与小队之间以及小队内部互相查对的依据，而且数字很笼统，因此社员也无从知道账目是否有错。有了差错，也不能及时发现、纠正。久而久之，账目也就很难弄清了。如去年8月里前村社第三大队社员徐土根向社预支了一双箩，会计却记在第二大队的徐士根名下，直到公布年终分配方案的时候才被发现。有的社员说，这是“良心账”，记多记少是凭会计的良心。那些发现自己的账目被记错的社员，指责会计说：“我们辛辛苦苦做了一年，到头来只得到这笔糊涂账。”因此尽管全社只有不多几笔差错，社员的心里却是“草木皆兵”，大家都怀着疑心，到会计室里来查账、对账，来查账的人最多时一天有近百人。而会计员呢？则感到“吃力不讨好”“受冤枉气”。为了查一笔差错，少则半天，多的两三天，累得会计员很疲劳。
    预支、借支批准权过于集中，也造成财务上的混乱和干部事务忙乱。并社前，前村、星华两社实行按劳预支制，但没有定期。五一、新庄两社没有预支制度。而这四个社的共同的预支做法是：由社统一把钱直接发给社员。至于要借支的户，都得全由社长盖章批准，会计室付款。社员认为“预支、借支就是向社长要钱用”，甚至把支钱看成是“挣工资”。再加社主任存有恩赐观点，批准借支、预支的数目很大。结果，工分做得多的户，预支不到钱，或得到很少几个钱。他们说，“如今只要会争，请多少，是多少，社长章一盖，伸手就是钱。”这些人的生产情绪不高。支到钱的社员，因为没有严格的控制，有的因为到年来一扣除，剩下无几了；有的甚至还亏欠。有些社员支到钱去买酒、买肉，乱吃乱用。而社主任、会计、出纳，则整天忙于应付批条子、付钞票。
    矛盾怎样解决
    并社后，前村社的会计徐学章同志被选为星华农业社的主办会计。他为过去的问题感到苦恼。原先前村社只有四百零三户，有三个脱产干部（二个会计、一个出纳）搞财务工作，还忙得头昏脑胀；现在七百五十三户了，会计人员没增加，怎样能完成任务呢？他反来复去地思考。后来他想到年终决算的时候，有些差错不是社员发现的吗？如果把制度改变一下，使社员能随时监督账目、发现问题，那不就好办了吗？
    他把自己的想法在党的分支部委员会上提了出来。在这个社工作的乡总支书记和支部都支持他的意见。分支部委员会对于这个问题在作了详细讨论后，作出了决定。
    星华社根据支部的决定，从今年1月起，实行按月公开全社财务收入账目和社员的工分、投资、归还投资、预支、借支等项明细账，建立社和队、社和社员、队和社员之间的连环查账制度（如劳动工分数字，要使社员劳动手册上的明细账和队的工分明细账相符，社、队和社员的总工分账相符；又如投资、借支账目，社的分户明细账要和按月发给队的社员分户明细账相符）。公布账目的方法是：每月月底由各小队记工员把本小队每户社员全月工分、预支、借支、投资、归还投资的数字逐项登记，连同“分户公布表”报送社的会计室，由会计填在社的账簿上以后，再把这两种表退还各队，以备查对。
    另一个改进是实行预支、借支的分级负责管理制，社只掌握各个大队的预支、借支的总的比例，社员的预支、借支由大队直接掌握（这个社的主要副业——造草纸，是以大队为单位生产的）。具体作法是：副业收入的30％作为大队的按劳预支数，15％是借支数（有一个大队因为经济困难，允许预支比例稍大些），副业收入的其余部分交给社统一使用。大队（或小队）在处理社员借支问题的时候，要经过社员民主讨论。
    为了使各队、社员对社的财务和各队的开支进行监督，合作社按季度逐项公布各小队农业生产开支（包括队向社领取的肥料、农具修添费用等等）和副业收入上交数。
    执行新的制度，必然要增加小队记工员的工作量。为此，党支部召开了记工员会议，教育他们提高工作责任心，并由社的会计带动他们学习新的记账方法，合作社给记工员补贴少数工分，以补助他们因为记账产生的误工。
    实行新的财务制度以后，要求借支的人减少了，借支款也减少了。例如社员舒阿斌，五口人，有劳动力两个半，去年盲目支钱，到年终结算的时候，倒欠社六十三元。今年这几个月里，他用钱有节制了，到3月底才借支两元钱。社员们对于这种做法十分满意。大家认为这样做主要有三个好处：第一是消除了疑虑，大家再不必担心“社大账难清”了，全心全意，积极生产。第二是预支、借支由社员自己讨论决定，不再存有“向社主任拿工资”的雇佣观点了；同时，本队有多少钱可以预支、借支，大家也心里有数，认真监督，保证合理使用。第三因为账目清楚，在社员中间，过去那种因为财务混乱而产生的埋怨、猜疑社干部的情绪消除了，干部和社员的团结加强了。社干部从被动地应付预支、借支的状况下解放出来，可以用更多的精力去领导生产。
