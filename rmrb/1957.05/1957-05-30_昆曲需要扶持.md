    Kunqu Opera Needs Support
    Han Shichang
    In the old society, Kunqu Opera art suffered neglect and destruction, almost leading to the demise of this excellent traditional opera. After liberation, under Chairman Mao's instruction of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new," Northern Kunqu Opera artists joined the revolution in 1949 (Beijing People's Art Theatre), hoping to pass on their skills to the next generation. At that time, Kunqu Opera performances were organized in places like Huai Rentang. However, most members of the People's Art Theatre's committee, except for a few who agreed, believed that Kunqu Opera was a product of the feudal landlord class. It was once separated to form the Capital Experimental Theatre Troupe, but soon it was changed to perform Peking Opera, and some Kunqu Opera artists were dismissed. Only a few of us, including Bai Yunsheng, Hou Yongkui, and Ma Xianglin, remained in the Song and Dance Theatre, teaching body movements according to the requirements of the new opera and dance. Male and female students alike were required to learn the movements of male warrior roles (believing that the movements of Kunqu Opera female roles were unhealthy), and Kunqu Opera could not be discussed, otherwise it would be considered "restorationism" and "national essence." Some leaders told me that "Kunqu Opera is already dead," which made me very discouraged and led me to sell all my precious stage ornaments. In the first National Opera Observation and Performance, Kunqu Opera artists only served as observation representatives and could not participate in the performance (Shanghai originally prepared eight Kunqu Opera programs, but it was considered that Kunqu Opera could not be counted as a type of opera and could not participate). After "Fifteen Strings of Cash" was performed in Beijing, Kunqu Opera art began to receive attention. We were very moved to hear Premier Zhou's speech. The Ministry of Culture also organized us to perform in Shanghai and to tour Hangzhou, Suzhou, Nanjing, and other places, and we were welcomed by the masses. However, since returning to Beijing, the issue of establishing a Kunqu Opera Theatre has faced various obstacles, such as staffing (the orchestra of the Song and Dance Theatre alone has seventy people, while the entire Kunqu Opera Theatre—including support staff—is only allocated seventy positions), housing (currently there is no theatre site, and young people have to travel five or six *li* back and forth for training and lunch), and funding cannot be resolved quickly. These unfair treatments, delays, and cold shoulders have discouraged the old artists and demoralized the young comrades. We hope that the leadership can provide support and solutions, and call on people from all walks of life to enthusiastically support this ancient opera art.

    昆曲需要扶持
    韩世昌
    昆曲艺术在旧社会时受尽漠视与摧残，使这一优秀的传统剧种几乎死亡。解放后，在毛主席“百花齐放，推陈出新”的指示下，北方昆曲艺人在1949年就参加了革命（北京人民艺术剧院），想把自己所会的东西传给第二代。当时也曾在怀仁堂等处组织过昆曲演出。但人民艺术剧院的院委除少数赞成外，大都认为昆曲是封建士大夫阶级产物，一度被分出搞首都实验剧团，不久又改演皮黄，将一些昆曲艺人遣散，仅剩我和白云生、侯永奎、马祥麟等少数人留在歌舞剧院，根据新歌剧舞蹈的要求教授身段，男女学员一律学武生动作（认为昆曲旦角动作不健康），不能谈昆曲，否则就被认为“复古主义”、“国粹”。有的领导对我说“昆曲已经死亡了”，因此使我非常灰心，将仅有“头面”都卖掉。第一届全国戏曲观摩会演中昆曲艺人只作观摩代表，不能参加演出（上海原准备昆曲剧目八个，但被认为昆曲不能算一个剧种，不能参加）。十五贯来京演出后，昆曲艺术开始受到重视。听到周总理讲话，使我们非常感动。文化部也组织我们去上海会演，并到杭州、苏州、南京等地巡回演出，受到了广大群众的欢迎。但自回京后，关于筹建昆曲剧院的问题却受到种种的阻碍，如编制（歌剧院一团乐队即有七十人，而昆剧院全体——包括勤杂人员，仅给七十人名额）、房屋（目前无院址，青年练功、午餐要往返五、六里）、经费都不能从速解决。这些待遇不公，拖延冷淡，使老艺人们灰心，青年同志们精神涣散，希望领导部门能予以支持解决，呼吁社会人士能热心扶植这一古老的戏曲艺术。
