Xinhua News Agency, May 21st: Delegates attending the Third National Congress of the Communist Youth League continued to criticize the work of the Central Committee of the League in their speeches at the congress this afternoon, and put forward some demands of the youth.

    Yang Qing, Secretary of the Tangshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, read a joint speech on behalf of representatives from seven cities including Tangshan, Shijiazhuang, Zhangjiakou, Baoding, Handan, Qinhuangdao, and Chengde, criticizing the shortcomings of the Central Committee of the League's work, such as subjectivism, one-sidedness, detachment from reality, insufficient in-depth work, and inadequate leadership over grassroots work. The joint speech pointed out that in the recent period, the Central Committee of the League has been relatively sensitive to new things and has shown boldness in its work, taking the lead in many matters. This style has had a positive impact on League committees at all levels. However, the Central Committee of the League often considers many things without sufficient caution and thoroughness. One manifestation of this is that requirements often deviate from reality, and another is that propaganda is often one-sided. For example, when military sports were launched among young people in 1956, Tangshan formulated a plan to train 2,160 ordinary shooters and 5,230 labor-defense system preparatory grade participants. However, the military sports department of the Central Committee of the League suggested that the Tangshan Municipal Committee of the League train 20,000 ordinary shooters and change the labor-defense system preparatory grade participants to 8,000. As a result, only 410 ordinary shooters were trained, completing 2% of the plan, and the labor-defense system was only half completed. The Central Committee of the League's official newspaper, "China Youth Daily," once published a news item with a large headline about eliminating sparrows in seven days. There were also one-sided phenomena in the propaganda of eradicating illiteracy, establishing youth production teams, wearing colorful clothes, and cultivating individuality. This kind of subjective and one-sided approach has resulted in many tasks being tight at the beginning and loose at the end, unfinished, neglecting one thing while attending to another, and making a lot of noise but achieving little.

    The joint speech mentioned that the Central Committee of the League's work was not in-depth, with few summaries of experiences, and insufficient leadership over grassroots work. The leaders of the Central Committee of the League are very effective in breaking new ground, but when problems arise at the grassroots level that urgently need to be solved, timely assistance from the leadership is sometimes not available. The representatives suggested in the joint speech that the Central Committee of the League should actively participate in the rectification movement in accordance with the instructions of the Central Committee and the spirit of the congress, and be determined to set an example in overcoming subjectivism and one-sidedness in the work of the Communist Youth League; they hoped that responsible comrades of the Central Committee of the League would go deep into the grassroots and help grassroots League committees study some practical problems.

    Guo Yongze, Secretary of the Harbin Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, criticized the Central Committee of the League for not paying enough attention to the ideological and organizational construction of the League. Zhang Jianmin, Deputy Secretary of the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League, criticized the Central Committee of the League for insufficient leadership over the League system at the lower levels. Zhu Shu, Director of the Propaganda Department of the Wuxi Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League in Jiangsu Province, in her speech, requested that the Youth League organization better help young mothers make progress. In his speech, Xu Zhenzhong of the Northeast Branch Committee of the Geological Bureau of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, requested that the leadership of the Youth League work in the geological exploration department be strengthened. He hoped that the Central Committee of the League and the Provincial Committee of the League would conduct a serious study and determine the leadership relationship of the League, based on the characteristics of the high mobility of geological exploration staff.

    Xiang Nan, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, spoke about the need for ideological work to adapt to the new situation. He conducted self-criticism of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the League for its insufficient understanding of the new problems caused by the new situation among young people in the past period, and therefore, its one-sided excessive promotion of improving and "beautifying" the lives of young people, and its neglect of educating young people to work hard and inherit revolutionary traditions. He believes that in the future, the League organization should help young people gain a correct understanding of labor, unity, and the relationship between politics and work. To make ideological work adapt to the new situation, it is necessary to vigorously promote the idea of hard work and thrift in building the country, and educate young people to treat the country's difficulties with the attitude of masters; it is necessary to guide young people to improve their ability to distinguish right from wrong in the "letting a hundred flowers bloom" and "letting a hundred schools of thought contend"; it is necessary to adhere to the method of gentle breeze and drizzle, and persuading people with reason, and oppose dogmatism and subjectivism in ideological work.

    Deng Xiang, Secretary of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, spoke on the issue of uniting backward youth. Deng Xiang believes that the main reason why some League organizations cannot adhere to the policy of persuasion and education in dealing with backward youth is that there is a sectarian sentiment within the League from top to bottom. Many people regard themselves as advanced and leaders, and look down on any youth with shortcomings and mistakes; secondly, League cadres do not go deep into the grassroots and do not understand the situation, and therefore cannot distinguish right from wrong. He pointed out that the way to solve this problem is to thoroughly correct the simple and crude attitude and practices while overcoming sectarian sentiments. Persist in the policy of persuasion and education, wait patiently, and enlighten consciousness. At the same time, the reasons for youth backwardness should be seriously investigated and studied, the facts and rights and wrongs should be clarified, and the ideological education of backward youth should be combined with solving practical problems.

    Sixteen representatives spoke at the conference today, and seven other representatives made written statements to the conference.

    积极参加整风，克服主观主义和片面性
    青年团代表大会的代表对团中央的工作提出批评和建议
    据新华社21日讯　出席青年团第三次全国代表大会的代表们，今天下午在大会发言中继续对团中央的工作提出批评，并且提出了青年们的一些要求。
    青年团唐山市委书记杨青在会上宣读了唐山、石家庄、张家口、保定、邯郸、秦皇岛、承德等七个城市的代表们的联合发言，批评团中央工作中的主观片面、脱离实际和工作不深入，对下边工作领导不够的缺点。联合发言指出在最近一个时期团中央对新事物比较敏感，工作上有魄力，许多事情抢在前边干，这种作风对各级团委都有良好影响。但是，团中央对许多事情考虑得不慎重、不周到，表现之一是要求往往脱离实际，另是宣传常常片面。例如1956年在青年中开展军事体育时，当时唐山制定了训练普通射手二千一百六十人，劳卫制预备级五千二百三十人的计划。可是团中央的军事体育部门却建议团唐山市委训练普通射手二万人，劳卫制预备级改为八千人。结果只训练了四百一十名普通射手，完成了计划的2％，劳卫制也只完成了一半。团中央的机关报——中国青年报曾经用大字标题刊登过七天消灭麻雀的消息，在扫盲、建立青年生产队、穿花衣服、培养个性等问题的宣传方面也都有片面现象。这种主观片面的结果，就使许多工作前紧后松，有头无尾，顾此失彼和雷声大雨点小。
    联合发言谈到团中央工作不深入。总结经验少，对下边的工作的领导不够，团中央的领导在轰开局面时很有力，但当下边碰到问题迫切需要解决时，有时得不到领导及时的帮助。代表们在联合发言中建议团中央要按照中央指示和大会的精神，积极参加整风，在克服青年团工作中的主观主义和片面性方面下定决心作出榜样；希望团中央负责同志深入基层，帮助下边团委研究一些实际的问题。
    青年团哈尔滨市委书记郭永泽在发言中批评团中央不大重视团的思想和组织建设工作。青年团安徽省委副书记张建民批评团中央对下面团的系统领导不够。青年团江苏省无锡市委宣传部长朱姝的发言，要求青年团组织更好地帮助青年妈妈们进步。青年团冶金工业部地质局东北分局委员会徐振忠的发言中，要求加强对地质勘探部门青年团工作的领导。他希望团中央和团省委根据地质勘探工作人员流动性较大的特点，认真地作一次研究，确定团的领导关系。
    青年团中央宣传部部长项南在发言中谈到了思想工作要适应新的形势的问题。他对团中央宣传部在过去一段时期内，对新形势在青年中所引起的新问题认识不足，因而曾经片面地过多地宣传了改善和“美化”青年的生活等问题和忽视了对青年进行艰苦奋斗、继承革命传统的教育进行了自我批评。他认为今后团组织要帮助青年对劳动、对团结、对政治和业务的关系获得正确的认识。要使思想工作适应新的形势，就必须大力宣传艰苦奋斗、勤俭建国的思想，教育青年以主人翁的态度来对待国家的困难；要引导青年在“百花齐放”、“百家争鸣”中提高辨别是非的能力；要坚持和风细雨、以理服人的方法，反对思想工作中的教条主义和主观主义。
    青年团武汉市委书记邓祥就团结后进青年的问题作了发言。邓祥认为，有些团组织对待后进青年不能坚持说服教育的方针的主要原因，是由于团内从上到下有一种宗派主义情绪，有很多人以先进者、领导者自居，看不起任何有缺点和错误的青年；其次是团干部作风不深入，不了解情况，因而不能分辨是非。他指出解决这个问题的办法是在克服宗派主义情绪的同时，要彻底纠正简单粗暴的态度和作法。坚持说服教育的方针，耐心等待，启发自觉。同时对青年后进的原因要认真调查研究，弄清事实和是非，把对后进青年的思想教育与解决实际问题结合起来。
    今天在大会上发言的有十六位代表，还有七位代表向大会作了书面发言。
