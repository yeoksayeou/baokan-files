Comrade Zuo Ye, Assistant Minister of Agriculture, when Old Man Fu visited the Agricultural Exhibition, said to the news reporters who wanted to take a picture and asked him to move out of the shot temporarily: "What? Are you more important, or am I? If you keep squeezing, I'll have you all thrown out!" As if that wasn't enough, a staff member from the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs added fuel to the fire, saying to the reporters: "Don't squeeze anymore. Someone already had an opinion. If you keep squeezing, all the reporters will be thrown out!" (According to reports in the China Youth Daily and Shanghai Wenhui Daily). This incident has aroused indignation in public opinion, and Wenhui Daily also published an editorial on the subject, entitled "Respect News Reporters."

Respect for people is one of the basic manifestations of communist morality. I imagine that Comrade Zuo Ye and others with similar thoughts are quite familiar with this principle. Why, then, would he become so angry as to tell people to "get out"? I think the problem still lies in the question, "Are you more important, or am I?"

Hearing the voice is like seeing the person. Although I also regret that the reporter did not take that wonderful shot in time, this sentence still vividly highlights a "bureaucratic" demeanor, making people smell some mustiness in his soul. In the eyes of those who believe in "level theory," he must have thought that he was the third or fourth most "important" person at the venue that day, even if he didn't count as number one or two. As for reporters and photographers, what did they amount to?

I don't intend to discuss the levels between reporters and assistant ministers with Comrade Zuo Ye, although that may be what he is most interested in. Nor do I need to further explain the importance of the work of photography reporters. This assistant minister comrade seems to have forgotten a most basic fact, namely: that he and all the people present that day (including those he considered "less important" than him and those "more important" than him, including our most respected Old Man Fu), are actually equal in status. The relationship between people in a socialist society is based on genuine and completely equal comradely foundations, and no one has the right to say that he is more important than others. Some people may disagree with this. They may question: Is the work of an assistant minister not more important than that of a reporter? Dear comrades, you are wrong. In such an occasion, the work of a photography reporter is indeed much more important than that of an assistant minister. Without them, the photos that millions of people are eager to see would be impossible. Isn't this a very simple truth?

Perhaps this principle is stated in vain. It seems that for those who think that a "high" level means they can arbitrarily scold people and always want to compare "importance" with others, learning to respect people and treat people with equality may be even more "important."

    要学会尊重人
    梁汝怀
    农业部部长助理左叶同志，在伏老参观农业展览会那天，当新闻记者想要摄影请他暂时让开镜头的时候，他说：“怎么？你重要还是我重要？再挤，就叫你们滚出去！”这还不算，外交部新闻司一位工作人员又走过来火上加油，对记者说：“你们别挤了，方才已经有一位同志有意见了。再挤，就叫记者都滚出去！”（据中国青年报、上海文汇报的报道）这件事引起了舆论界的愤慨，文汇报为此还发表了社论，题目是“尊重新闻记者”。
    尊重人，是共产主义道德品质的基本表现之一，这道理，左叶同志及其他有类似思想的人，想来也是十分熟悉了的。为什么还会一冒火就要叫人“滚出去”呢？我想问题还是出在“你重要还是我重要”这句话上。
    闻其声如见其人。虽然我也为那位记者没有及时照下这个精彩的镜头感到遗憾，但是这句话也仍然活龙活现地突出了一副“官”气十足的神情，使人闻到他的灵魂里的一些霉味。在“级别论”者心目中，当天的会场上，自己纵然数不上第一、第二，大约也凑得上第三、第四号“重要”人物了。至于什么记者、摄影师，算得个啥？
    我不打算同左叶同志研究记者同部长助理之间的级别，尽管那也许是他最感到兴趣的；也无需再为摄影记者工作的重要性多加解释。这位部长助理同志似乎忘却了一个最基本的事实，即：他跟当天所有在场的人（包括他认为比他“不重要”和比他“重要”的，包括我们最敬爱的伏老在内），地位其实都是平等的。社会主义社会人与人之间的关系，正是建立在真正的、完全平等的同志式的基础上的，谁也没有权力说他比别人重要些。这样一说，有人也许不服气。会质问：难道部长助理的工作还比不上一个记者来得重要吗？亲爱的同志，你说错了，在那样的场合，摄影记者的工作，硬是比部长助理重要得多。没有他们，亿万人所渴望的照片就无从见到。这不是很浅显的道理吗？
    这个道理，也许是白说。看来，对于那些以为级别“高”就可以任意呵斥人、开口就要跟别人比“重要”的人来说，学会尊重人、学会以平等态度对待人，也许倒是更“重要”的。
