Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 18th (TASS dispatch): French Communist Party Central Committee General Secretary Maurice Thorez has criticized the current French government's policies, which have led to a variety of harmful consequences, such as the deterioration of the living conditions of the working people, the continuation of the Algerian War, France's loss of national independence within the scope of "Little Europe," the planning of atomic warfare, and the infringement of democratic freedoms and the intensification of the danger of fascism, etc.

Thorez made this assessment of the current government's policies in a lengthy speech delivered on the first day of the French Communist Party Central Committee plenary session held from May 14th to 16th. He emphasized that, in addition to these facts, a new and important factor has emerged in France, namely, that a broader stratum of residents, including the middle class, has begun to realize more and more clearly the consequences of this policy. He said that this change in mass consciousness is primarily a product of the development of objective conditions, and secondly, a result of the activities of the Communist Party. He said that especially now, accelerating the development of events depends on the activities of the entire party and every party member leading the masses. We must live up to the aspirations of the masses, take action, take new steps, and bring about the era of decisive change as soon as possible.

Thorez continued, saying that in order to decisively change France's policy direction, it is necessary to attract the working masses of the Socialist Party and their party to participate in the common struggle. He emphasized that, in this regard, it is necessary to do a series of explanatory work to the ordinary members of the Socialist Party to make them realize the hypocrisy of the Socialist Party leaders' stance on the Algerian question and their actions to aid and abet fascism.

Thorez refuted the argument that colonial policy helps maintain France's dignity. He pointed out that those politicians who shout about maintaining France's dignity in Africa are striving to make this dignity vanish in Europe, and France's vital interests are being sacrificed in Europe.

Thorez said that the reactionaries have been led by the course of history onto the road of betraying national interests. This banner should be in the hands of the working class and the Communist Party. He also called for strengthening the struggle against any fascist danger.

Thorez pointed out that in the past the struggle of the working class was limited to the economic aspect, but at present this struggle is developing in a broader direction, including the Algerian War issue, disarmament, and the cause of defending peace.

Thorez said: The time has come to redouble our efforts to establish the united front of the working class, unite all democratic forces, in order to change France's policies, implement the program agreed upon by the people on January 2, 1956, and achieve the victory of social progress, freedom and peace, in order to advance along the socialist road. We should mobilize the entire party to carry out the broadest propaganda and organizational work among the masses, so that our party can successfully complete the decisive tasks it faces: to establish, organize and develop a united front of the working class, and to establish a broad democratic alliance dedicated to social progress, freedom, national independence and peace.

    多列士抨击法政府政策
    号召全党加强行动争取变革
    新华社19日讯　据塔斯社巴黎18日讯：法国共产党中央委员会总书记多列士抨击法国现政府的政策导致了种种有害的后果。例如劳动人民生活条件的恶化、阿尔及利亚战争的继续、法国在“小欧洲”范围内丧失民族独立、策划原子战争以及侵犯民主自由和法西斯主义危险的加强等等。
    多列士是在5月14日到16日举行的法共中央全会第一天会议上发表的长篇演说中对当前政府的政策作出这一估价的。他强调指出，除了这些事实以外，在法国已经出现了一种新的重要因素，那就是更广泛的居民阶层，包括中产阶级在内，已经开始愈来愈清醒地意识到这种政策的后果。他说，群众意识的这一改变，首先是客观条件发展的产物，其次是共产党活动的结果。他说，特别是现在，加速事件的发展有赖于全党的活动和每个领导群众的党员。我们必须不辜负群众的愿望，行动起来，迈出新的脚步，使决定性变革的时期早日到来。
    多列士继续说，为了决定性地改变法国的政策方针，必须吸引社会党工人群众和他们的党来参加到共同的斗争中来。他强调指出，在这方面必须向社会党普通党员做一系列的解释工作，使他们认清，社会党的领导人对待阿尔及利亚问题的立场的虚伪性以及他们为法西斯助威的行动。
    多列士驳斥了殖民政策有助于维护法国尊严的论调。他指出，那些高喊维护法国在非洲的尊严的政客们正竭力使这种尊严在欧洲化为乌有，法国的切身利益在欧洲正遭受着牺牲。
    多列士说，反动分子被历史的进程引上了背叛民族利益的道路。这一旗帜应当掌握在工人阶级和共产党的手里。他还号召加强对任何一个法西斯危险的斗争。
    多列士指出，从前工人阶级的斗争局限在经济方面，但是，目前这个斗争正在往更广阔的方面发展，包括阿尔及利亚战争问题、裁军和保卫和平的事业。
    多列士说：加倍努力建立工人阶级的统一阵线，联合所有民主力量，以便改变法国的政策，实行人民在1956年1月2日所同意的纲领和达到社会进步、自由与和平的胜利，以便沿着社会主义的道路前进的时刻已经来到了。我们应该动员全党来进行最广泛的宣传和组织群众的工作，这样，我们党就能够顺利地完成它面临的有决定意义的任务：建立、组织和发展工人阶级统一阵线，建立致力于社会进步、自由、民族独立和和平的广泛的民主联盟。
