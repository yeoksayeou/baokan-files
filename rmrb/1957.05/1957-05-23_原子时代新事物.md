    New Things in the Atomic Age
    Atomic Clock
    Recently, two Soviet scientists designed an "atomic clock." If it runs continuously for a hundred years, the error compared to absolute standard time will not exceed a few seconds. This is more accurate than the quartz clocks currently used by astronomers. Currently, the assembly of the "atomic clock" is nearing completion. The "atomic clock" is characterized by using atomic vibrations (currently using ammonia molecule vibrations) to replace the function of a pendulum. Its principle is: ammonia molecules excited by an oscillator can emit an electromagnetic oscillation within a specific resonator. This oscillation is not affected by time or external conditions and has extremely high stability. This oscillation is then passed through a frequency divider to reduce the frequency of the oscillation, which can obtain a highly stable low-frequency oscillation to drive the movement of the clock's mechanism.
      The "atomic clock" can be used to examine the Earth's rotation and measure its non-uniformity, which has great value in scientific research.
    Narrow-Gauge Atomic Locomotive
    Japanese scientists recently completed the design of one of the world's first narrow-gauge atomic locomotives. It has three thousand horsepower and a maximum speed of 95 kilometers per hour.
      This atomic locomotive only needs to load a little over seven kilograms of fuel each time, and each load can last for nine months without refueling. Its annual consumption cost is about 70% lower than that of a diesel locomotive.
      The atomic reactor of this locomotive is installed in the center of the locomotive. To prevent harmful rays emitted by the reactor, the reactor is surrounded by multiple layers of layered material made of special boron-containing steel and paraffin wax. The train is also equipped with a safety device that can stop the chain reaction of the reactor at any time under any circumstances.
    The construction of this atomic locomotive requires huge amounts of capital. Therefore, whether the atomic locomotive can be put to practical use remains to be studied.
      Atomic Battery
      RCA (Radio Corporation of America) recently invented an atomic dry battery. It is only the size of a matchbox, but it can last for twenty years.
      This battery can directly convert atomic energy into electrical energy without going through the process of generating electricity in a general atomic reactor. Therefore, this battery can be widely used in daily life as a power source for electric lights, radios, refrigerators, etc. If such a battery is added to household electrical appliances, it can be enjoyed for twenty years without being affected by the outside world, which is both convenient and economical. Currently, this battery is not yet in mass production. (Xinhua News Agency)

    原子时代新事物
    原子钟
    苏联两个科学家最近设计了一种“原子钟”。它如果不间断地走一百年，和绝对标准时间的差错不会超过几秒钟。比目前天文学家用的石英钟还要准确。目前，“原子钟”的装配工作很快就要完成了。“原子钟”的特点是以原子振动（目前是利用氨分子振动）来代替钟摆的作用。它的原理是：被振荡器激发的氨分子在特定的谐振器内能够放射一种电磁振荡，这种振荡不受时间和外界条件的任何影响，具有极高的稳定性。这种振荡再经过一种减频器，把振荡的频率减低，就能够得到一种高度稳定的低频率振荡，推动钟的机件运动。
      “原子钟”可以用来检查地球自转的情况和测出它的不均匀度，在科学研究上具有很大价值。
    狭轨原子能机车
    日本科学家不久前设计完成一种世界上最早的狭轨用原子能机车。它有三千匹马力，最高速度每小时可达九十五公里。
      这种原子能机车每次装载燃料的重量只有七公斤多，而每装一次后可以行走九个月不需要再加燃料。它的年消费量价格比柴油机车还要低约70％。
      这种机车的原子反应堆装在机车中央，为了防止反应堆发出的有害射线，在反应堆周围用含硼特殊钢和石蜡交互配置的层状体多层包围起来。车上还装着一种安全装置，在任何情况下随时都可以停止反应堆的连锁反应。
    建造这种原子机车需要巨额资金，因此，原子能机车能否实际使用，尚待研究。
      原子电池
      美国无线电公司最近发明了一种原子干电池。它只有火柴盒那么大，但是可以用二十年。
      这种电池能够把原子能直接变成电能，不必经过一般原子反应堆发电的过程。因此，这种电池可以在日常生活中大量用作电灯、无线电、电冰箱等的电源。如果在家庭的电气用具上，加上一个这样的电池，就可以在二十年内享用，不受外界的影响，既便利又经济。目前，这种电池还没有大量生产。　　（新华社）
