Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 16th. Dong Shaochen, a member of the Standing Committee of the Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce, suggested withdrawing public representatives from joint public-private enterprises and handing over the management of the enterprises to the private sector, to work under the leadership of the Party branch.

Dong Shaochen said: The current public-private partnership is not working well, which is related to the fact that the public representatives see themselves as transformers, and the private sector generally has no power. In fact, the public-private relationship can be summarized in two sentences: "Does the public sector trust the private sector? Is the private sector willing to do it?" Although these two sentences are simple, they contain a lot. Currently, although company managers and deputy managers have a division of labor, the public sector always goes to meetings; after returning from meetings, the section chiefs and Party member cadres already know, and then talking to the private sector is actually unnecessary to say it's assigning work, because everyone already knows.

Dong Shaochen said: Public representatives only have political capital and no technical experience, so they cannot do a good job in production. The private sector personnel themselves do not think they are useless; in the past, they also managed their own enterprises well; moreover, it has been more than a year since the joint venture, and they have also learned a lot of management methods from state-owned enterprises. Therefore, he advocates: In an enterprise, as long as there is a Party branch, under the leadership and support of the Party branch, hand over the power of production management to the private sector for one year and see if it works. He said: There are indeed capitalists who "sleep for five years and transform for two years," but generally industrialists and businessmen are willing to work actively, otherwise so many advanced workers would not have emerged. He believes that if the power is handed over to the private sector, and this "wealth" of the private sector is tapped, and the public representatives are transferred to positions where they are truly needed, this is also increasing production and practicing economy.

Dong Shaochen is a member of the Standing Committee of the Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce and Deputy Manager of Tianjin Paper Industry Company. He made this suggestion to a reporter stationed in Tianjin for the Dagongbao a few days ago. This opinion has aroused the interest of many industrialists and businessmen in Tianjin to discuss it.

### 天津工商联常委董少臣建议  撤出合营企业的公方代表

    天津工商联常委董少臣建议
    撤出合营企业的公方代表
    新华社天津16日电　天津市工商界人士董少臣建议把公私合营企业的公方代表撤出去，把企业管理权交给私方，在党支部的领导下进行工作。
    董少臣说：目前公私共事关系搞不好，这与公方代表以改造者自居，私方普遍有职无权有关。实际上公私关系有两句话就可以概括：“公方对私方信不信任？私方愿不愿意干”？这两句话虽然简单，但内容很多。目前公司经理、副经理虽然有分工，但开会总是公方去；开会回来后，科长党员干部都已知道，这时再向私方谈谈，其实要说是布置工作已经用不着了，因为大家都已经知道了。
    董少臣说：公方代表光有政治资本没有技术经验，是搞不好生产的。私方人员自己觉得并不是饭桶，过去他们也曾管理好自己的企业；况且合营已经一年多了，国营企业的管理方法也学到了不少。因此他主张：在一个企业里，只要有党支部的，在党支部领导和支持下，把生产管理权交给私方执行一年，试试看行不行？他说：“五年睡觉二年改造”的资本家确乎有，但一般工商业者还是愿意积极干，如不然先进工作者就不会涌现出那么多了。他认为：如果把职权交给私方，把私方这笔“财富”挖出来，把公方代表调到真正需要的岗位上，这也是增产节约。
    董少臣是天津市工商业联合会常务委员、天津市造纸工业公司副经理。他的这个意见是前几天对大公报驻天津记者说的。这个意见已经引起天津市许多工商业人士探讨的兴趣。
