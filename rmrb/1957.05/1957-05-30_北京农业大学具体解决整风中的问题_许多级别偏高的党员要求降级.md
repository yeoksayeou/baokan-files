    Beijing Agricultural University Specifically Addresses Problems in Rectification; Many Higher-Level Party Members Request Demotion
    (Our Newspaper Dispatch) Since the start of the rectification campaign at Beijing Agricultural University, numerous forums for teachers have been held. The Party Committee has studied the issues raised by the teachers. To better resolve these problems, four groups have been established: the Three-Anti and Ideological Remolding Inspection and Handling Group, the Anti-Secret Agents Inspection and Handling Group, the Wage, Welfare, and Housing Group, and the Other Issues Handling Group.
    On May 23rd, the Party Committee convened a meeting of all Party members among the university's faculty and staff. At the meeting, Chen Zhen, Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee, called on all Party members to earnestly examine the privileged thinking of Party members raised by the masses. He said that some Party members have the same level of work ability as some non-Party members, and the same workload as them, but their wages are higher and their ranks are also higher, which is unreasonable. He hoped that these Party members could voluntarily propose salary reductions and demotions. He also asked Party members to give up the extra housing they occupied. Regarding the issue of welfare subsidies, priority should be given to those who are most in need of assistance in their lives.
    Currently, many Party members at Beijing Agricultural University have voluntarily proposed salary reductions and demotions, and some have also offered to give up housing. The Party Committee is studying how to handle these issues and is preparing to make reasonable resolutions.
    On May 26th, the Party Committee invited the heads of various democratic parties and the trade union within the university to discuss how the democratic parties and the trade union could further assist the Party in rectification, dispel the concerns of the masses, and fully encourage free expression. Everyone believed that timely handling of the problems that can be solved now would be beneficial to promoting the movement. At the meeting, Shi Ping, Secretary of the Party Committee, suggested that the heads of the democratic parties and the trade union organize a group to specifically review some Three-Anti cases and submit reasonable handling opinions to the Party Committee.

    北京农业大学具体解决整风中的问题
    许多级别偏高的党员要求降级
    本报讯　北京农业大学开始整风以来，开了多次教师座谈会。党委会根据教师所提出的问题进行了研究。为了更好地解决这些问题，成立了三反及思想改造检查处理小组、肃反检查处理小组、工资福利房屋小组和其他问题处理小组等四个小组。
    5月23日，党委会召开全校教职员中的党员会议。在会上，党委副书记陈阵同志要求全体党员，认真检查群众所提出的党员特权思想。他说，有些党员，工作能力同一些党外人士一样高，工作量同他们一样重，而工资却比他们多，级别也比他们高，这是不合理的。他希望这些党员能自动提出减薪降级。他又要求党员，把多住的房子让出来；关于福利补助金问题，应尽量优先照顾那些生活上最迫切需要补助的人。
    目前，北京农业大学已有许多党员自动提出减薪降级的要求，还有的提出要让出房子。党委正在研究处理这些问题，准备作合理的解决。
    5月26日，党委会邀请校内各民主党派和工会负责人，讨论关于各民主党派和工会如何进一步帮助党整风，解除群众顾虑，大放大鸣的问题。大家认为及时处理目前可能解决的问题，对推进运动是有好处的。在会上，党委书记施平同志建议，由各民主党派和工会负责人组织一个小组，专门审查一些三反案件，向党委提出合理的处理意见。
