Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 7th - The Egyptian newspaper "Al-Gomhuria" said in an editorial on the 6th that the victory of the "National Front" in the Syrian parliamentary by-election was a major blow to all the imperialist conspiracies in Syria. The newspaper said that the imperialist agents believed that the current crisis in Jordan would give them an opportunity to create the same situation in Syria and other parts of the Arab world. However, the Syrian people have demonstrated their will: only candidates representing the "National Front" and advocating positive neutralism can represent them in Parliament.

Xinhua News Agency, 7th - According to a United Press report from Washington on the 5th, U.S. officials were "disappointed" with the results of the Syrian parliamentary by-elections, and U.S. officials had hoped that right-wing candidates would be elected.

    埃报欢呼　美国泄气
    新华社开罗7日电　埃及“共和国报”6日的社论说，“民族阵线”在叙利亚议会补缺选举中的胜利是对帝国主义在叙利亚的全部阴谋的一个重大打击。报纸说，帝国主义代理人以为，约旦目前的危机将使他们获得机会在叙利亚和阿拉伯世界的其他部分制造同样的情况。但是，叙利亚人民已经表明了他们的意志：只有代表“民族阵线”并且主张积极中立主义的候选人才能在议会中代表他们。
    新华社7日讯　据合众社华盛顿5日消息，美国官员对叙利亚议会补缺选举的结果“感到失望”，美国官员曾经希望右派候选人当选。
