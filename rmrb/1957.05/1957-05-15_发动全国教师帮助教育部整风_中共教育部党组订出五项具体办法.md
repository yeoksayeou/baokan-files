    Launch a Nationwide Teacher Campaign to Help the Ministry of Education Rectify its Work
    CCP Ministry of Education Party Group Formulates Five Specific Measures
    (Reported by this newspaper) On May 14th, the head of the CCP Ministry of Education Party Group met with reporters to discuss the issue of mobilizing teachers nationwide, local education administrative cadres, student parents, and related members of society to help the Ministry of Education Party organization rectify its work.
    The Party Group leader said that in order to rectify our work well, in addition to making the greatest determination ourselves, we must also obtain assistance from teachers in primary and secondary schools, normal schools, higher normal colleges, kindergartens, and vocational and spare-time schools across the country, education administrative cadres, student parents, and other parties. Because our leadership is divorced from reality, divorced from the masses, and high above, there is a wall and a ditch between us and the broad masses of the education community nationwide. If we do not tear down the wall and fill in the ditch, we cannot fully utilize everyone's enthusiasm, which will be detrimental to the development of education. Now is the time to tear down the wall and fill in the ditch. We sincerely welcome criticism of the leadership of the Ministry of Education. We hope that everyone can fully expose the shortcomings and errors in our leadership work in the spirit of "letting go" and "speaking out" and help us to better understand the problems.
    Regarding how to mobilize teachers, student parents, and other people from all walks of life to offer criticism of the leadership of the Ministry of Education, the Party Group leader put forward five measures:
    First, the Ministry of Education will continue to take effective measures to solicit criticisms and opinions from teachers, education administrative cadres, and experts on the school system, teaching plans, teaching syllabi, and textbooks in order to revise them.
    Second, the Ministry of Education has instructed the Teachers' Newspaper to organize teachers and education administrative cadres to criticize and make suggestions on the work of the Ministry of Education. We also welcome other newspapers to help us carry out this organizational work.
    Third, the Ministry of Education is preparing to organize a series of symposiums in a planned manner to invite teachers and education administrative cadres to discuss various issues. In addition, we are also preparing to organize a certain number of personnel to go to local areas to solicit opinions.
    Fourth, if teachers, education administrative cadres, student parents, and other people from all walks of life have opinions on the work of the Ministry of Education, we also hope that they will write directly to us.
    Fifth, when local education administrative departments mobilize teachers and cadres to offer opinions, they should also mobilize them to criticize and offer opinions on the leadership of the Ministry of Education.

    发动全国教师帮助教育部整风
    中共教育部党组订出五项具体办法
    本报讯　14日，中共教育部党组负责人招待记者，谈关于发动全国教师、地方教育行政干部、学生家长及有关各方面社会人士帮助教育部党组织整风的问题。
    党组负责人说，我们要整好风，除去自己下最大的决心以外，还必须得到各地中小学校、师范学校、高等师范院校、幼儿园及职工业余学校教师，教育行政干部，学生家长及其他方面人士的帮助。由于我们的领导脱离实际，脱离群众，高高在上，与全国教育界广大群众之间，存在着一堵墙和一条沟。如不拆掉墙，填平沟，就不能充分发挥大家的积极性，不利于教育工作的发展。现在就要拆墙填沟，我们热诚地欢迎他们对教育部的领导进行批评。希望大家能本着“放”和“鸣”的精神，充分揭发我们领导工作中的缺点和错误，帮助我们很好地认识问题。
    关于如何发动教师、学生家长和其他各界人士对教育部的领导方面提出批评，党组负责人提出五点措施：
    第一，教育部继续采取有效的办法，征求教师、教育行政干部以及专家对学制、教学计划、教学大纲和教科书的批评和意见，以便进行修改它们。
    第二，教育部已责成教师报，组织教师和教育行政干部对教育部工作进行批评和提出建议。同时也欢迎其他报纸，能帮助我们进行这项组织工作。
    第三，教育部准备有计划地组织一些座谈会，邀请教师和教育行政干部座谈各方面的问题。此外，还准备组织一定的人力到地方去征求意见。
    第四，教师、教育行政干部、学生家长以及其他各界人士对教育部工作有意见，也希望直接写信来。
    第五，地方教育行政部门，在发动教师、干部提意见时，同时也请发动他们对教育部的领导提出批评和意见。
