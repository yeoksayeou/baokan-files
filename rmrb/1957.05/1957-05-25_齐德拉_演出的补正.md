    Corrections to the "Chitra" Performance
    Regarding the statement "according to Mr. Wu Xiaoling" in the "A Dialogue on the 'Shakuntala' Rehearsal'" on page 4 of your newspaper on the 13th of this month, there are some "untruths based on hearsay." The performance of Tagore's play at the Xiehe Hospital auditorium took place on May 8, 1924. That year, the poet was sixty-three years old (sixty-four in the Chinese way of reckoning age). At that time, "Chitra" was performed in English. There are two Chinese translations of this play: one is Wu Zhijue's classical Chinese translation, "Qian Qula," and the other is Qu Shiying's vernacular Chinese translation, "Chitra."
    Accompanying the poet on his visit to China was Dr. Nandalal Bose, the foremost contemporary Indian painter and retired president of the Kala Bhavan (College of Arts) of Visva-Bharati University. He wrote in a letter from Beijing: "The performance of Chitra was quite successful. I helped a little with the makeup and costumes. Their eyes are not quite right, but they tried their best to act, doing it somewhat like the Manipuris. The men and women in the cast are all quite presentable, and I think Princess Chitra might really be Chinese!" The late architect Lin Huiyin played Chitra.
    It should be clarified that I also learned this from "hearsay" because I was only ten years old that year.

### “齐德拉”演出的补正

    “齐德拉”演出的补正
    本月13日你报第四版的“‘沙恭达罗’排练场上的一段对话”里的“据吴晓铃先生谈”的话有一些“传闻失实”。在协和医院礼堂演泰戈尔翁的戏的时间是1924年5月8日，那年诗人是六十三岁（虚岁六十四）。当时演出“齐德拉”（Chitra）是用的英语。这个剧本有两个汉语译本：一个是吴致觉的文言译本“谦屈拉”，一个是瞿世英的口语译本“齐德拉”。
    当时陪同诗人访问中国的有当代印度第一名画家、国际大学艺术学院退休院长难达婆薮博士。他在北京写信说：“齐德拉的演出相当成功。我在化装和服装方面帮了一点小忙。他们的眼睛有些不很对劲儿，但是他们尽可能去做戏，做得有些像曼尼堡（Manipur）人。参加演出的男人和女人都很像样儿，我看恐怕齐德拉公主就真许是中国人呢！”去年逝世的建筑学家林徽音女士扮演的齐德拉。
    应该说明，我也是得诸“传闻”，因为那年我才十岁。
