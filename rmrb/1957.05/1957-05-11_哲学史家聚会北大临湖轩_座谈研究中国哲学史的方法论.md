Philosophers Gather at Peking University's Linhu Xuan
    Symposium on Methodologies for Studying Chinese Philosophy History

    (Our dispatch) The Chinese Philosophy History Working Conference was held at Linhu Xuan, Peking University, yesterday morning at 9:00 AM. The conference focused on discussing methodological issues in the study of Chinese Philosophy History.

    There is a relatively common view that Chinese Philosophy History has its own characteristics, and its regularity should be identified. Zhu Qianzhi and Wang Dianji both believed that to identify its regularity, attention should be paid to the development of natural sciences. They also believed that the study of Chinese Philosophy History should be linked to the study of world philosophy history and Eastern philosophy history. Feng Qi pointed out that the general laws of philosophical thought should be sought not only from socio-economic relations but also from other ideologies and the development of philosophy itself. Yang Rongguo believed that only by grasping the laws of socio-economic development can one grasp the laws and systems of ideological development; otherwise, philosophical thought will lose its original appearance, and there will be no scientific Chinese philosophy history. Zhou Fucheng said that Chinese philosophers all had political aspirations, and philosophical thought served their political aspirations; without this characteristic, there would be no Chinese philosophy history.

    Regarding the issue of inheriting philosophical heritage, Liu Hanchen's speech supported the views expressed by Feng Youlan at the previous discussion. He believed that what should be inherited is the general meaning; otherwise, inheritance would be impossible. Huang Zitong said that Hu Sheng believed that limited abstraction is permissible, but limited abstraction is still abstraction, indicating that this issue has not been resolved. Zhu Bokun said that some people say inheritance is inheriting common factors, but what are the common factors? There are also different understandings of this.

    There were quite a few different views on how to distinguish between materialists and idealists. Hou Wailu said that in recent years, there has been a trend as if the more materialists we have among our ancestors, the more glorious we are, thus there have been cases of trying to portray idealists as materialists as much as possible. If this continues, then our philosophers from Confucius to Sun Yat-sen would all be materialists. But scientific research cannot be done this way. He believed that to determine whether a philosopher is a materialist or an idealist, one should look at his ideological system. Shi Jun believed that some thinkers do not have complete systems, and we cannot create systems for the ancients. Liu Hanchen disagreed with his statement, arguing that although systematization is difficult, systems do exist. He said that the objective method of distinguishing materialists from idealists is to see whether they adopt the inductive method or the deductive method; if they use the former, they are materialists, and vice versa. Zhu Bokun believed that it should be clarified whether materialism and idealism can be transformed into each other, how they are transformed, whether materialism is absolutely correct, and whether idealism is absolutely wrong.

    Zhang Dainian raised the issue of class analysis of philosophical thought. He believed that the ancients should also be given the opportunity for "a hundred schools of thought to contend" and should not be oversimplified. He Siqing said that Marxism cannot always be stuck in class analysis. With the fundamental changes in the times, the research methods of philosophy history should also be changed. Our philosophy history should explain what problems were raised and solved in the philosophy history of class societies. This can promote reflection among later generations.

### 哲学史家聚会北大临湖轩  座谈研究中国哲学史的方法论

    哲学史家聚会北大临湖轩
    座谈研究中国哲学史的方法论
    本报讯　中国哲学史工作会议，昨日上午九时在北京大学临湖轩举行。会议集中地讨论了研究中国哲学史的方法论问题。
    中国哲学史是有其特点的，应该找出它的规律性，这是比较普遍的看法。朱谦之和汪奠基都认为要找出其规律性应该注意研究自然科学的发展情形。他们并认为研究中国哲学史也应该和世界哲学史、东方哲学史联系起来考察。冯契指出，哲学思想的一般规律，不但要从社会经济关系中去找，还要从其他意识形态和哲学自身的发展中去找。杨荣国认为只有抓住社会经济的发展规律，才能抓住思想发展的规律和系统，不然哲学思想就会失去它的本来面目，就不会有科学的中国哲学史。周辅成说，中国哲学家都有政治抱负，哲学思想是为他们的政治抱负服务的，取消了这一特点，就没有中国哲学史。
    关于哲学遗产的继承问题，刘汉辰的发言支持了冯友兰在前次讨论会上发表的意见。他认为，要继承的就是一般的意义，不然就无法继承。黄子通说，胡绳认为有限度的抽象是可以的，但有限度的抽象仍是抽象，可见这个问题并没有解决。朱伯昆说，有人说继承是继承共同因素，但什么是共同因素？还有各种不同的理解。
    对于唯物主义者和唯心主义者如何区分，很有些不同的看法。侯外庐说，近年来有一种风气，好像祖先中唯物主义者愈多我们就愈光彩，因此有将唯心主义者尽量说成唯物主义者的事。如果这样下去，那末我国哲学家从孔子到孙中山就都是唯物主义者了。但是科学研究是不能这样的。他认为确定那个哲学家是唯物主义者还是唯心主义者，应该看他的思想体系。石峻认为，有些思想家是不成体系的，我们不能代古人制造体系。刘汉辰不同意他的说法，认为虽然按体系很困难，但体系是有的，他说区分唯物主义者或唯心主义者的客观方法是看他们是采用归纳法呢，还是采用演绎法，如用前者就是唯物主义者，反之则是唯心主义者。朱伯昆认为唯物主义和唯心主义是否能相互转化？如何转化？唯物主义是否绝对正确，唯心主义是否绝对错误，应该明确。
    张岱年提出了哲学思想的阶级分析问题，他认为也应该让古人有百家争鸣的机会，不应该简单化了。何思敬说，马克思主义不能老停在阶级分析上，时代发生了根本的变化，哲学史的研究方法也应该有所改变，我们的哲学史应该说明，阶级社会的哲学史上提出了什么问题，解决了什么问题。这样才能促使后人思考。
