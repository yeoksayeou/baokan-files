    A Casual Discussion on the Relationship Between the Party and Intellectuals
               Chen Yuan, President of Beijing Normal University
    Since Chairman Mao's recent two reports, everyone has been enthusiastically discussing the issue of how to correctly handle contradictions among the people, especially among intellectuals, which has stirred up a wider upsurge, making them feel enlightened and their thoughts more active. Recently, I met several friends who deeply felt the correctness of the Party's policies. Someone said: "I have spoken out frankly today about things I haven't said for many years." Many people reflected that their relationship with the Party is closer than before. This is a correct manifestation of the Party's ideological leadership, which will undoubtedly lead to a more rapid development and prosperity of our scientific, cultural, and educational undertakings.
    Speaking of contradictions among the people, the relationship between the Party and intellectuals naturally comes to mind. The relationship between the Party and the five million intellectuals is an extremely important issue, one that we must not ignore and must solve well.
    Many friends have mentioned that there is a wall between leaders and the masses, between the Party and intellectuals. Because there is a wall, there is a sense of estrangement. People cannot talk freely, and opinions are not readily accepted. Both sides of the wall fear that the walls have ears and are suspicious of each other. As a result, they cannot fully express themselves, and their relationship is merely one of seeming closeness but actual distance. How can work be done well in this way? Since the wall exists, and in the past everyone was afraid to speak out about it, the wall would become thicker and thicker, to the point that the people on both sides would become more and more distant, even superficially united but internally divided. Now that everyone has spoken out and is determined to tear it down, the "day of tearing down the wall" is naturally an extremely exciting thing.
    I think that since there is a wall, the reasons are probably on both sides, and the responsibility should also be borne by both sides. Therefore, if we want to solve the problem, we should also start from both sides. On the one hand, it is necessary to correct the incorrect assessment of non-Party intellectuals by certain Party members in some units, earnestly implement the central government's policies, and improve the shortcomings in the work. This is the main aspect. On the other hand, it is the issue of self-remolding of the intellectuals themselves.
    The Party has always attached great importance to the work of intellectuals. Under the guidance, assistance, trust, and support of the Party, intellectuals have made many contributions to various construction undertakings. Since last year's conference on the issue of intellectuals, the work of intellectuals has been further improved. However, it is undeniable that there are still shortcomings in the work. Taking the work of universities as an example, some responsible comrades have become tainted with old styles, standing high above and not being good at listening to the opinions of the masses; some Party members regard themselves as "authorities," not allowing others to criticize them, and not conducting self-criticism; or only listening to the feedback from Party and League members, and not understanding the opinions of the old professors, and so on. In particular, there is insufficient understanding of some old professors, their progress is underestimated, there is a certain degree of sectarian sentiment, and therefore they are not given enough importance, are not used properly, and their enthusiasm is not brought into play. If some young Party members cannot understand the feelings of the old teachers and their attitude is somewhat stiff, it will be easier to create an emotional gap between the old and the new. Over time, the wall is formed intentionally or unintentionally. For Party members, from the Party's policies they have accepted and their own feelings, most of them subjectively did not intend to build this wall. A young Party member once told me: "I have been conscientious in paying attention to the relationship between the Party and the masses, the relationship between the new and the old, fearing that my actions would go against the Party's policies, but problems have arisen in the relationship between the new and the old." I think it is necessary to raise the issue for study and research to see what causes this contradiction. The ancients said: "If loving people does not bring them closer, examine your own benevolence; if governing people does not bring order, examine your own wisdom; if showing courtesy to people does not receive a response, examine your own respect. If there are things that do not succeed, always look inward." This means that if you clearly have good intentions towards someone, but they think you have bad intentions, there must be a reason. Then you need to investigate yourself and see what problems there are in your work. Whenever there are things that don't work, always ask yourself. This will make you healthy and will also win people's hearts. Now the Party has decided to conduct a new rectification campaign, a new self-criticism, to examine thoughts, correct mistakes, overcome shortcomings, and point out that it is necessary to constantly criticize oneself and educate oneself in order to prepare conditions for new victories. This is also the principle of looking inward. I think that for the sake of new victories, for the consolidation and development of our socialist cause, we intellectuals welcome this new rectification campaign, and we should also actively help the Party examine its work during the rectification movement.
    Chairman Mao said: "There is still an abnormal state between the Party and the intellectuals, which cannot be blamed on the intellectuals, but should first be demanded of the Party." I think that contradictions always have two opposing sides. On this issue, the Communist Party wants to examine itself, which we extremely support. But we, as intellectuals, probably also need to think carefully about whether we also have shortcomings such as subjectivism, and whether we should also learn the spirit of the Party and adopt the attitude of looking inward to recognize ourselves.
    In this rectification movement, the Party has put forward a new
  self-criticism. I think that rectification means to correct, and the Party is using the spirit of "correcting oneself before correcting others," and the attitude of strictly demanding of itself, striving to avoid or make fewer mistakes in its work in the future. This is a very touching and admirable attitude. Such an attitude is not easy for intellectuals, especially those who are older and have more habits from the old society, and it requires very deep cultivation to truly achieve. Sometimes it is not just a matter of correcting oneself and correcting others, but of not being able to see one's own shortcomings and mistakes, while seeing the shortcomings and mistakes of others very clearly. Of course, it is very good to point them out and have them corrected; the worst thing is to push all the mistakes and shortcomings onto others at every turn, blaming others more and blaming oneself less, not being good at thinking for others, and being accustomed to thinking very carefully for oneself.
    More than two thousand years ago, Confucius, when he understood the ideological situation of the social figures and intellectuals of the time, warned them: "The gentleman seeks in himself, the petty man seeks in others," to examine themselves, to "be generous to oneself and lenient with others," and not to just complain about others all day long. First examine yourself to see if there are any mistakes, and if there are mistakes, you should also "not be afraid to correct them." No one can avoid making mistakes, and if mistakes can be corrected, it is still beneficial to the work, so it is said that "there is no greater good than being able to correct one's mistakes." But he later finally sighed in disappointment, saying: "Alas! I have not seen anyone who can see his own mistakes and internally accuse himself." Probably it is already very difficult to not be afraid to correct mistakes when others point them out, but it seems that it was rare at the time to be able to correctly recognize oneself and correct mistakes.
    Of course, the situation is very different today, but we intellectuals often think that we have some knowledge, and think that others are "unlearned and unskilled," while we are "learned and skilled," and therefore are very conceited, self-important, even arrogant and self-important, thinking that we are the best in the world, and are not accustomed to accepting the leadership or criticism of others. In fact, if we think about it calmly, we ourselves still have limited knowledge. At least many of us are not very familiar with Marxism. In this way, isn't it also not a comprehensive view that some people think they are "learned and skilled"?
    When talking about the issue of the wall, the Party's leading comrades said: "There should be no wall between the Party and non-Party members. But there should be a line between the Party and non-Party members, that is: Party members should work harder, be more humble, and should not have any sense of superiority as Party members." I think it is of course necessary for the Party to require Party members to endure hardship before others and enjoy benefits after others. But if this line is limited to being a line of how much work one does and whether one's attitude is humble or not, then, I think, shouldn't we intellectuals also require ourselves to do more work, be more humble, and not have any sense of superiority as intellectuals, especially senior intellectuals? If this line only includes this content, then wouldn't it be very good for us intellectuals to take the initiative to gradually erase it?
    "Those who educate people must first be educated," this is a very important thing. If you educate others, but you are not humble to be educated first, and you do not seriously remold yourself, it will affect others, even leave harm to future generations, wouldn't that be very dangerous? I think that since we intellectuals are not necessarily all "learned and skilled," and many of us are people who educate people, then we must first be educated and actively carry out self-remolding. Learning and remolding are long-term for us intellectuals, especially in this period of great social change. In order to improve the relationship between the Party and intellectuals, in order to make this relationship have a new look, our five million intellectuals also bear great responsibility, and I think this is also a new task for intellectuals in the new situation.

    漫谈党和知识分子的关系
              北京师范大学校长　陈垣
    自从毛主席最近两次报告后，对于如何正确地处理人民内部矛盾的问题，大家都进行了热烈的讨论，尤其在知识分子中间更广泛的掀起了热潮，感到心目开朗，思想活跃起来。最近我见到几位朋友，都深深感到党的政策的正确。有人说：我多年没说的话，今天都畅快的谈了出来。很多人反映与党的关系比以前更加亲密了。这就是党的思想领导的正确的表现，这就无疑的会使我们科学文化教育事业更迅速的发展和繁荣。
    谈到人民内部的矛盾，很自然的就会谈到党和知识分子的关系。党和五百万知识分子的关系是其中极其重要的问题，也是我们决不容忽视、必须很好解决的一个问题。
    很多朋友都谈到领导和群众之间、党和知识分子之间有一堵墙。因为有墙，就形成了隔阂，有话不能谈，有意见不愿接受，墙的两边都怕隔墙有耳，彼此猜疑，于是不能尽情倾吐，关系只是若即若离，那末工作怎能作好？既然有墙存在，而过去大家又都不敢说出，墙就会越加越厚，以至两侧人群，越离越远，甚至貌合神离。如今大家都讲了出来，并决心要拆掉它，那末“拆墙有日”，自然是极令人兴奋的事情。
    我想既然有墙，原因恐怕是两方面的，责任也应该由两方面来负，
  因此想要解决问题，也应当从两方面着手。一方面就是纠正某些单位党员对非党知识分子的不正确的估计，认真贯彻中央的政策，改进工作中存在的缺点，这是主要的一方面。另一方面也就是知识分子本身自我改造的问题。
    党从来就是十分重视知识分子工作的，知识分子在党的指导和帮
  助、信任与支持下，在各种建设事业上作出了不少贡献。去年知识分子问题会议以后，知识分子工作，就更得到进一步的改善。但是也不可否认，工作中还存有缺点。就拿高等学校的工作来说，某些负责同志沾染了旧的作风，高高在上，不善于倾听群众意见；某些党员以“权威”自居，不许别人批评自己，不进行自我批评；或只听党团员的反映，不去了解老教授意见等等。尤其是对一些老教授，了解不足，对其进步估计过低，有一定程度的宗派情绪，因此对他们重视不够，使用不当，未能发挥其积极作用。如果再加上有些年轻党员，不能体谅老教师心情，态度有些生硬，则更容易造成新老之间感情上的隔阂。日子一久，墙就在有意无意之间形成了。在党员来说，从他所接受的党的政策以及他自己的感情上，大多是主观上并没有存心想筑出这道墙的。曾有一个年轻的党员告诉我说：“我兢兢业业的注意党群关系、新老关系，只怕自己行动有背党的政策，而偏偏就在新老关系上出了问题。”我想把问题提出来研究研究，到底是由于什么原因会构成这个矛盾，是十分必要的。古人说：“爱人不亲反其仁，治人不治反其智，礼人不答反其敬，行有不得者，皆反求诸己。”这就是说：你明明对他好意，而对方反以为是坏意，其中自有原因在，那就要追究一下自己，看看工作中还有哪些问题。凡是有行不通的事情，都要反问一下自己，这样就会自己也健康起来，并且也会使人心服。现在党已决定进行一次新的整风，新的自我批判，检查思想，纠正错误，克服缺点，并且指出要经常自己批判自己，自己教育自己，才能为新的胜利准备条件，这也就是反求诸己的道理。我想为了新的胜利，为了我们社会主义事业的巩固和发展，我们知识分子欢迎这次新的整风，而且也应当在整风运动里，积极帮助党检查工作。
    毛主席说：“党和知识分子中间还有不正常的状态，这不能怪知识分子，应当首先要求党。”我想矛盾总是有两个对立面，在这个问题上，共产党要检查自己，我们极端拥护，但是我们作为知识分子，恐怕也要很好的考虑一下，主观主义等等缺点，知识分子也是有的，是否也应当学习党的精神，采用反求诸己的态度，来认清自己呢？
    这次整风运动，党提出了新的
  自我批判。我想整者正也，党就是用“先正己而后正人”的精神，就是用严格要求自己的态度，力求今后在工作中不犯错误或少犯错误。这是十分使人感动而且令人尊敬的态度。这样的态度，对知识分子来说，特别是对年纪较大、旧社会习惯较多的知识分子来说，就不是很容易的事情，真正做到就要有很深的修养。有时还不是正己正人的问题，而是自己很难看出自己的缺点和错误，往往对别人的缺点和错误就看得很清楚。当然看出以后而且提出来得到改正，自然是非常好的；最怕动不动就把错误和缺点都推给别人，责人者多，责己者少，不善于替别人着想，而习惯于为自己考虑得很周到。
    二千多年前，孔子在了解到当时的社会人士、知识分子的思想情况时，曾告诫他们说：“君子求诸己，小人求诸人”，要反躬自问，要“躬自厚而薄责于人”，不要整天只瞒怨别人。自己先检查一下，看看有什么错误，如果有了错误，也应当“过则勿惮改”。谁都不能不犯错误，犯了错误如果能纠正，对工作还是有利的，所以说“过而能改，善莫大焉”。但是他后来终于失望的长叹一声，说：“巳矣乎！吾未见能见其过而内自讼者也。”大概别人指出错误，可以作到不怕改正，已经很不容易，而自己能正确的认识自己，改正错误，当时恐怕是不多见的。
    今天当然情况大有不同，但是我们知识分子，往往自以为有点学问，认为别人是“不学无术”，自己是“有学有术”，因而很自负，自命不凡，甚至妄自尊大，自以为天下第一，不习惯于接受别人领导或批评。实际上平心静气一想，我们自己还不是懂得有限，至少我们很多人对马克思主义就还不是很熟悉的。这样看来，某些人认为自己“有学有术”，岂不是也并非全面看法呢？
    谈到关于墙的问题时，党的领导同志说：“党和非党之间不应当有墙。但是党和非党之间应当有一条线，那就是：党员应该工作得更多些，态度更谦逊些，而不应当有什么党员优越感。”我看作为党要求党员应当吃苦在前，得利在后，当然是必要的。但是如果这条线，只限于是工作多少，态度谦逊与否的一条线，那末，我想我们知识分子不是也很应当要求自己工作作得更多些，态度更谦逊些，不应当有什么知识分子特别是高级知识分子优越感吗？如果这条线只是包括这个内容，那么就由我们知识分子主动的争取逐渐把它给擦了去，不是也很好吗？
    “教育人的人先要受教育”，这是很重要的事情，自己教育别人，而自己却又不虚心先受教育，不认真改造，将会影响别人，甚至遗患后代，这岂不很危险？我看我们知识分子既然并不一定都是“有学有术”，而且很多人都是教育人的人，那末，一定先要受教育，积极进行自我改造。学习和改造对我们知识分子来说是长期的，尤其处在这社会大变动时期。为了搞好党和知识分子的关系，为了使这一关系面貌一新，我们五百万知识分子也是负着很大责任的，我想这也是在新的形势下知识分子的新任务。
