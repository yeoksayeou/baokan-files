    美国防部长宣布
    将运原子武器往南朝鲜
    本报综合报道　据新华社消息：美国国防部长威尔逊14日晚上宣布，美国打算把能够发射原子弹头的武器运往南朝鲜。这些武器包括“诚实约翰式”火箭、“下士式”导弹和“斗牛士式”导弹。
    威尔逊还说，美国正在考虑把驻在南朝鲜的两个美国陆军师改为原子部队，并且不久就会作出决定。
    李承晚的国防部长官金用雨和联合参谋总长丁一权，15日都对美国国防部长威尔逊准备把原子武器运进南朝鲜的谈话表示欢迎。
    金用雨要求美国“尽快”把现代武器运到南朝鲜，他并且把威尔逊透露的美国这一违反停战协定的战争措施说成是“最伟大的道义力量”。丁一权也迫不及待地想把南朝鲜变成原子战争基地，他说，原子武器的运达再要“拖延”就要“危及”在南朝鲜的“联合国军”。
