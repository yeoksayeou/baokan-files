    The Vietnamese "People's Daily" and other newspapers have recently published articles exposing the egregious behavior of certain unscrupulous merchants in Hanoi and Haiphong who engage in speculation, profiteering, and hoarding, demanding that the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam take appropriate measures to stop them. According to the materials revealed in the articles, the main targets of unscrupulous merchants' speculation, profiteering, and hoarding are items closely related to the people's lives and in high demand, such as cotton cloth, cotton yarn, mosquito nets, Western medicine, Chinese medicine, tea, and sugar. Many articles expose how certain unscrupulous merchants, taking advantage of the increased demand for cotton cloth among the people, purchased large quantities of cloth on the market at low prices, hoarded them, and then sold them at high prices to reap exorbitant profits. One article specifically exposes the situation of certain unscrupulous merchants speculating on cotton yarn, saying: Recently, some people in Hanoi, Henan, Nam Dinh, Jian'an, and Hedong who contract with state-owned trading companies to process and weave cloth have illegally sold the cotton yarn given to them by the trading companies on the market at high prices, which has had a huge impact on the country's economic construction and the people's lives.

    Chairman Ho Chi Minh, based on the National Assembly's resolution and the Council of Ministers' recommendations, promulgated a decree prohibiting speculation and profiteering. The decree stipulates fines or imprisonment of varying degrees for merchants engaged in this illegal activity. Other measures taken by the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam include: State-owned trading companies, with the assistance of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, after inspecting the phenomenon of speculation and hoarding of cotton cloth and other items, signed reasonable distribution contracts with private cloth merchants that comply with the principle of mutual benefit, and signed cloth supply contracts with private garment merchants on the same principle.

    越南政府采取措施
    制止不法商人投机倒把
    本报讯　越南“人民报”等报刊近来连续登载文章，揭露河内、海防某些不法商人进行投机倒把、囤积居奇的恶劣行为，要求越南民主共和国政府采取适当措施予以制止。据文章揭露的材料看来，不法商人进行投机倒把、囤积居奇的主要对象，是一些和人民群众生活比较密切、需要量比较大的物品，例如棉布、棉纱、蚊帐、西药、北药
  （中药材）、茶叶、糖等。许多文章揭露某些不法商人利用人民需要棉布量增长的情况，以低价大量套购市场上的布匹，囤积起来，然后以高价出售，牟取暴利。有一篇文章具体揭露某些不法商人倒腾棉纱的情况说：最近，河内、河南、南定、建安、河东等地一些承接国营贸易公司加工纺织布匹的人，竟非法地把贸易公司交给的棉纱拿到市面上高价出售，对于国家的经济建设和人民的生活影响非常巨大。
    胡志明主席根据国会决议和部长会议的建议，颁布了禁止投机倒把的法令。法令规定对进行这种非法活动的商人进行程度不等的罚款或徒刑。越南民主共和国政府采取的措施还有：国营贸易公司在工商业联合会的协助下，经过对棉布等投机囤积现象的检查后，和私营布商签订符合两利原则的合理的经销合同，和私营成衣商签订同样原则的布料供应合同。
