A Record of Ninety-Nine Schools of Thought Contending
Mudan

While a hundred schools of thought contending is certainly good, wouldn't ninety-nine schools do just as well? My own school, though it also has something to say, is currently suffering from a disease of excessive modesty.

Our meeting room was packed, with exactly one hundred and one people. Why one extra? Ah, that's the chairman, just waiting to draw a conclusion.

Therefore, I'm a little nervous, planning to act according to the situation. First, Little Zhao spoke, every sentence demonstrating a complete lack of insight. But the chairman gave him some praise.

Then Qian and Sun spoke, their arguments clear and logical, though I knew the content was only half true.

Old Li made a self-criticism last year, and this time he started firing cannons again. Although his temper wasn't as fiery as before, every sentence was full of dissatisfaction with the leadership.

"What? Isn't this a personal attack? The point of contention is academic issues! We should carefully study the documents and, preferably, avoid factionalism!" Comrade Zhou always speaks correctly, always receiving the support of the leadership. Therefore, once he started talking, look, who dared to say half a "no"?

The issue turned to matters of principle. The most annoying thing was three terms. As a result, the atmosphere became lively, with at least fifty comrades speaking.

Among them was one nicknamed "Echo," and another was "False Forward." The two of them launched a verbal battle, truly a fight to the death, difficult to resolve.

If someone unfortunately mentioned a fact that was clearly different from the authoritative opinion, those who hadn't spoken quickly seized the opportunity to be "leftist" on this point: "This point is well known!" "Comrade so-and-so has a problem with their stance!"

The chairman said not to label people, so the latter sentence was spoken very circuitously.

And so, we dragged on until dismissal time. I hadn't spoken the whole time. The chairman insisted I say a few words, so I stood up and made three points: First, I was very excited about today's meeting; second, the contention was quite successful; third, I hope we can have more meetings like this, so everyone can be even more open and honest...

P.S. Dear reader, please don't compare this record of mine to a literary archetype, because, in fact, times have changed, and this is no longer the situation today. So, why publish it? I think the editor sees it very clearly: besides the ninety-nine schools of thought contending, it's also right to publish the voice of one insignificant soldier who remains silent.

    九十九家争鸣记
    穆旦百家争鸣固然很好，九十九家难道不行？我这一家虽然也有话说，现在可患着虚心的病。我们的会议室济济一堂，恰好是一百零一个人，为什么偏多了一个？他呀，是主席，单等作结论。因此，我就有点心虚，盘算好了要见机行事；首先是小赵发了言，句句都表示毫无见识。但主席却给了一番奖励；钱、孙两人接着讲话，虽然条理分明，我知道那内容可是半真半假。老李去年作过检讨，这次他又开起大炮，虽然火气没有以前旺盛，可是句句都不满领导。“怎么？这岂非人身攻击？争鸣是为了学术问题！应该好好研究文件，最好不要有宗派情绪！”周同志一向发言正确，一向得到领导的支持；因此，他这一说开呀，看，有谁敢说半个不是？问题转到了原则性上，最恼人的有三个名词：这样一来，空气可热闹了，发言的足有五十位同志。其中一位绰号“应声虫”，还有一位是“假前进”，他们两人展开了舌战，真是一刀一枪，难解难分。有谁不幸提到一个事实，和权威意见显然不同，没发言的赶紧抓住机会，在这一点上“左”了一通：“这一点是人所共知！”“某同志立场很有问题！”主席说过不要扣帽子，因此，后一句话说得很弯曲。就这样，挨到了散会时间，我一直都没有发言，主席非要我说两句话，我就站起来讲了三点：第一，今天的会我很兴奋，第二，争鸣争得相当成功，第三，希望这样的会多开几次，大家更可以开诚布公……
    附记读者，可别把我这篇记载来比作文学上的典型，因为，事实是，时过境迁，这已不是今日的情形。那么，又何必拿出来发表？我想编者看得很清楚：在九十九家争鸣之外，也该登一家不鸣的小卒。
