The Leading Party Members' Group of the Ministry of Finance invited 29 people from various democratic parties and non-party individuals within the ministry and its affiliated units on the 18th to a forum to assist the Communist Party in its rectification campaign. Hu Lijiao, Vice Minister of Finance, representing the Party Committee, said at the meeting: The purpose of the rectification is to improve our work. Therefore, we hope that everyone will criticize the shortcomings of the CCP party organizations and achieve "knowing all, saying all, saying all without reservation." This meeting is like a family meeting.

Chen Shenglan said: There is a feeling of "idly wasting my youth in vain regrets"

Chen Shenglan, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK) in the Ministry of Finance and Counselor of the Counselor's Office of the Ministry of Finance, said that the leading Party members of the Ministry of Finance have sectarian tendencies. Most of the people working in the Counselor's Office are members of democratic parties. In the autumn of 1955, the Counselor's Office was administratively notified to go home for recuperation. Everyone thought it was a disguised dissolution. In the salary evaluation of 1953, people above the 14th grade in the Counselor's Office were not promoted; during the 1956 wage reform, it was said that the 14th grade was the "top," which made these people feel like they had no "future." Before 1953, the Counselor's Office participated in various professional meetings. Since 1954, the units have not notified us to participate, and official documents have not been sent, so we have nothing to do all day long. I really have the feeling of "idly wasting my youth in vain regrets." In 1954, the directors and deputy directors of the democratic parties were transferred one after another. Is this sectarianism?

He also said: The Ministry of Finance's Three-Anti and Anti-Counterrevolutionary movements pre-determined percentages, proving that there was indeed subjectivism

Some Party members have very rigid attitudes and always think that old intellectuals are "backward." For example, in the "Anti-Counterrevolutionary" movement, we were asked to write materials. We wrote them, but the leadership did not quite believe us. If we did not write in detail, they would say that we did not rely on the organization; in order to write the materials more carefully, we had to ask the people concerned, and the organization said it was "leaking secrets." It was really difficult to move forward or backward.

Sectarianism in insurance companies is particularly serious. Whenever the personnel department calls someone, the person being called is always frightened, showing the depth of the estrangement. In the office, Party members pass notes to each other, making it very mysterious.

The "Three-Anti" and "Anti-Counterrevolutionary" movements of the Ministry of Finance were somewhat expanded. For example, during the "Three-Anti" movement, the "tigers" were pre-determined to be 25%, and the Anti-Counterrevolutionary movement was set at 5%. Is it scientific to predetermine percentages? Facts prove that there is indeed subjectivism.

Bureaucracy is very serious. The Counselor's Office studies financial legislation. In 1953, it submitted a report on sorting out the current regulations, but the leadership never approved it. As a result, the ministry has long lacked an organizational regulation. The main budget and final accounts rely entirely on some scattered orders. Subordinate bureaus can change the ministry's regulations, and the ministry can change the State Council's regulations. The approval authority is very chaotic. The tax system is also unsound.

Cui Jingbo said: Financial policy sways back and forth. Will there be too many "dismounts" again this year?

Cui Jingbo, member of the Central Committee of the China National Democratic Construction Association (CNDCA) and Deputy Director of the State Taxation Bureau, said: The Ministry of Finance is the country's general "housekeeper" and is related to the work of all aspects and departments. Its bureaucracy is no less than that of other departments. In the past few years, the country had surpluses in financial revenue, but in 1956, after the basic completion of the socialist transformation, the financial revenue and expenditure showed a tense situation, which shows that we have not managed our household well.

Lower-level cadres feel that the above acts "differently at different times." For example, in tax collection, sometimes it is tightened, and then we vigorously prevent "leftism." If it is too "left," we quickly prevent "rightism," which makes lower-level staff feel like they are swaying back and forth. Although this is also dialectics, it is not materialist dialectics, but formal dialectics.

In 1956, we opposed conservatism in finance, so we greatly let go; this year's budget has seen a trend of "dismounting" projects one after another. It is worth paying attention to whether there will be too many "dismounts."

He believes that the formation of sectarianism lies in many unnecessary systems

I think a major reason for the formation of sectarianism lies in some unnecessary systems. Such as personnel system, meeting system, reading document system. At the beginning of the founding of the country, there was no doubt that these systems should be uniformly controlled by the Communist Party, but as the country was established and time passed, these systems became "walls" and "ditches."

Yue Lu said: In some places, the leadership of the Party has been vulgarized

Yue Lu, Acting Chairman of the China Democratic League (CDL) branch of the Ministry of Finance, said: The leadership of the Party is realized through Party members; however, because the Party and the individual have not been distinguished, in many places, the phenomenon of the Party replacing the government and the Party and government not being separated has formed. For example, when participating in collective physical labor, teams are divided according to the Party branch, as if only Party members are working; when studying theory courses, the study group leader must also be a Party member. Is it necessary for a Party member to be the group leader or for the Party organization to come forward to be considered Party leadership? This makes people feel that the Party is in charge of everything, which vulgarizes the Party's leadership.

When promoting cadres, often only morality is emphasized, not talent. Many Party members rely on their Party membership to eat. I think the Party's honor and the individual's honor should be separated. The Party organization should treat Party members and non-Party members equally.

Feng Hengqing, an engineer at the Construction Bank and member of the China Democratic League (CDL), said: In the past few years, many technical departments of the Construction Bank have been led by cadres who do not understand technology, and the work arrangements for some technical personnel are not appropriate.

Yu Biaowen said: Insurance companies are in a dangerous state

Yu Biaowen, Deputy Director of the China Association for Promoting Democracy (CAPD) branch of the Ministry of Finance, said: Insurance companies are now in a dangerous state. Since liberation, the leadership of insurance companies has only been satisfied with some policy issues and some theoretical discussions, and has not paid enough attention to the current practical business work. Before 1953, the business methods of insurance companies were all the old society's set. After the "Three-Anti" movement, this set was completely negated, and a dogmatic attitude was adopted in learning from some advanced experiences of the Soviet Union. After agricultural collectivization, many people in the company doubted whether insurance was still needed in socialist countries. There are also various different views on this issue, so various opinions and contradictions have also arisen in the execution of the company's business work, which has greatly affected the work. I think whether insurance is still needed in socialist countries is a question worth exploring; however, it must not affect the current practical business work.

In insurance companies, the relationship between the Party and the masses has been uncoordinated for a long time. Party members have sarcastic and disrespectful phenomena towards some "old insurance people."

Cui Shuxiang said: The Finance Cadre School is a "cold palace," and some economists have entered "monasteries"

Cui Shuxiang, Director of the Statistics Teaching and Research Office of the Finance Cadre School, said: The Finance Cadre School bears the sacred responsibility of training financial and economic cadres for the country, but our school is a cold palace. It is not that we have been put into the cold palace, but the cold wind makes people feel cold. Some people say that the cadres transferred to the cadre school are "fourth-class cadres." This wind comes from the Ministry of Finance. Of course, there are also cold winds blowing from outside. For example, some universities look down on the Finance Cadre School. Many people are unwilling to come to our school, and the enthusiasm of the faculty and staff in the school is greatly affected.

The Ministry of Finance directly leads the cadre school, but I don't feel very warm. Listening to reports and reading documents are limited to those at the director level and above, and rarely mention teaching staff. We feel very depressed.

She finally said that she hopes the Ministry of Finance will strengthen its contact with economists and discuss some issues with them more often, which will benefit both the country and themselves. As far as I know, some economists have entered "monasteries," and others have nothing to do.

The symposium will continue on the 22nd.

### 像在家里谈心一样  财政部党组邀请民主党派人士座谈

    像在家里谈心一样
    财政部党组邀请民主党派人士座谈
    本报讯　中共财政部党委会于18日邀请该部和所属单位的各民主党派、无党派人士二十九人开座谈会，协助共产党整风。财政部副部长胡立教代表党委在会上说：整风的目的是为了改进工作，因此希望大家对中共党组织的缺点提出批评，要做到“知无不言，言无不尽”。这个会就像开家庭会议一样。
    陈盛兰说：有“闲白了少年头空悲切”之感
    民革财政部主任委员、财政部参事室参事陈盛兰说，财政部的党员领导干部是有宗派主义的。在参事室工作的人多系民主党派的成员，1955年秋天，行政上通知参事室的人员回家休养，大家当时以为这是变相地解散。1953年的评薪，参事室十四级以上的人一律不晋级；1956年工资改革时又说十四级是“顶头”了，使这些人感到没有“奔头”。1953年以前，参事室曾参加各种专业会议，1954年起各单位不通知参加了，公文也不送来，因此我们一天到晚无事可做。真有 “闲白了少年头，空悲切”之感。1954年又把民主党派的司、局长陆续调走了，这是否有宗派主义？
    他又说：财政部三反、肃反事先规定百分比，证明确有主观主义
    有些党员态度十分生硬，对旧知识分子总认为“落后”。如“肃反”运动中要求我们写材料。我们写了，领导上却不太相信，写得不详细，就说我们不依靠组织；我们为了把材料写得认真些，只得向有关的人打听，组织上又说是“通风报信”。真弄得进退两难。
    保险公司的宗派主义特别严重。每当人事部门打电话找，被找的人总是心惊胆跳，可见隔阂之深。在办公室，党员之间互相递条子，弄得很神秘。
    财政部的“三反”和“肃反”有些扩大化。如“三反”时预定“老虎”为25％，肃反则定为5％。事先订百分比的做法是否科学？事实证明确有主观主义。
    官僚主义十分严重。参事室是研究财政法制的，在1953年就提出了整理现行法规的报告，领导上从未批下来，以致部里长期以来没有一个组织条例，主要的预算和决算全靠一些零星的命令办事，下面的局可以改部的法规，部可以改国务院的法规，批审权限上十分混乱。税务方面也不健全。
    崔敬伯说：财政政策左右摇摆，今年会不会又“下马”过多
    民建中央委员、税务总局副局长崔敬伯说：财政部是国家的总“管家”，又关系到各个方面、各个部门的工作，它的官僚主义绝不比其他部门少。过去几年国家在财政收入上都有盈余，而1956年社会主义改造基本完成的情况下，财政收支却出现了紧张的局面，这说明我们的家没有管好。
    下级干部感到上面办事“此一时，彼一时”。如在税收上，有时抓紧了，就大力防左，左了就赶紧防右，使下级工作人员感到左右摇摆不定。这虽然也是辩证，但不是唯物辩证法，而是形式上的辩证法。
    1956年反对财政上的保守主义，因此大大放手；今年的预算又出现了纷纷“下马”的趋势，是否会出现“下马”过多的情况，很值得重视。
    他认为宗派主义的形成，在于许多不必要的制度
    我认为宗派主义的形成很大的原因在于一些不必要的制度。如人事制度、会议制度、阅读文件制度。这些制度在开国之初毫无疑义地应该由共产党统一掌握，但国家建立起来了，时间长了，这些制度就成了“墙”、成了“沟”。
    岳炉说：在有些地方把党的领导庸俗化了
    民盟财政部支部代主任委员岳炉说：党的领导是通过党员实现的；但是，由于党和个人没有分清，以致很多地方形成了以党代政、党政不分的现象。如在集体参加体力劳动的时候，也按着党的支部来分队，好像只有党员在劳动；在学习理论课的时候，学习组长也必须是党员。难道必须以党员作组长或是以党组织出面才算是党的领导？这样使人感到党是无事不管，把党的领导庸俗化了。
    在提拔干部时，往往是只重德，不重才。有很多党员就凭着党员名义吃饭。我认为党的荣誉与党员个人的荣誉要分开。党组织对党员和非党员要一视同仁。
    建设银行工程师、民盟盟员丰恒清说：建设银行几年来很多技术部门都是由不懂技术的干部领导业务，而对一些技术人员的工作安排得不妥当。
    俞彪文说：保险公司处在危险状态
    民进财政部支部副主任委员俞彪文说：保险公司现在处在危险状态。解放以来，保险公司的领导上只满足于一些方针政策性的问题和一些理论问题的探讨，对当前的实际业务工作不够重视。1953年以前，保险公司的业务工作方法都是旧社会的一套。“三反”以后，这一套全盘被否定了，对苏联的一些先进经验的学习又采取了教条主义的态度。农业合作化以后，公司里许多人对在社会主义国家里是否还需要保险的问题发生了动摇。在这个问题上也有着各种不同的看法，所以使公司的业务工作上在执行中也产生了各种意见和矛盾，对工作的影响很大。我认为，在社会主义国家里是否还需要保险的问题是一个值得探讨的问题；但是，绝不能因此影响当前的实际业务工作。
    在保险公司里，党群关系长时期以来是不太协调的。党员对一些“老保险”有讽刺和不尊重的现象。
    崔书香说：财政干部学校是一座“冷宫”，有些经济学家进了“修道院”
    财政干部学校统计教研室主任崔书香说：财政干校担负着为国家训练财经干部的神圣责任，但我们的学校却是一座冷宫。不是我们被打入冷宫，而是冷风吹来使人感到冷。有人说，调到干校的干部是“四等干部”，这风是从财政部吹来的。当然，也还有从外面吹来的冷风，例如有些高等学校就看不起财政干校。许多人都不愿到我们学校来，在校的教职员的工作积极性也大受影响。
    财政部直接领导干校，但我却感到不很温暖。听报告、看文件，都是限于什么长一级的，很少提教学人员。我们感到很苦闷。
    她最后说，希望财政部加强和经济学家们的联系，多和他们研究讨论一些问题，这对国家对他们本人都有好处。据我所知，现在的经济学家有一部分进了“修道院”，另一部分也无事可做。
    座谈会将在22日继续举行。
