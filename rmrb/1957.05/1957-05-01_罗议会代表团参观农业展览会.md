Xinhua News Agency, 30th - The Romanian Grand National Assembly and the Bucharest City People's Congress delegation visited the National Agricultural Exhibition this morning.

During the visit, the distinguished guests showed great interest in Chinese rice. The head of the delegation, Con. Pavelescu, said that China was the first country to grow rice and has rich experience. He hoped that China could send experts to Romania. Yang Xiandong, Vice Minister of Agriculture, who accompanied the distinguished guests on the visit, said that China would be very willing to do so. He also said that Romanian corn is world-renowned, and China is eager to learn from Romania's experience in this area.

Romania has provided China with great assistance in supplying agricultural tractors. During today's visit, the guests saw tractors from Romania and took photos with their Chinese hosts in front of the tractors.

When visiting the Tropical Crops Pavilion, Yang Xiandong told the guests that a Bulgarian expert once said that these tropical crops in China should be the common property of all fraternal countries. Con. Pavelescu smiled and agreed, saying that this was a valuable asset, especially for countries without tropical and subtropical regions.

After the visit, the National Agricultural Exhibition presented gifts to the guests.

All members of the delegation wrote in the exhibition's guest book: "After visiting the agricultural exhibition of the People's China, we were deeply impressed by the rich resources of China presented in artistic, educational and novel forms, as well as the strength and wisdom of the Chinese people in developing and utilizing these resources under the leadership of the Communist Party. We are convinced that this exhibition will surely fully achieve its purpose: to inspire the people's enthusiasm for building socialism. We wish all Chinese workers success in their efforts for their happiness and human peace."

Among those accompanying the delegation today were Wang Weizhou, member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Le Songsheng, Deputy Mayor of Beijing, and Romanian Ambassador to China, Chivu Stoica, and others.

    罗议会代表团参观农业展览会
    新华社30日讯  罗马尼亚大国民议会和布加勒斯特市人民会议代表团今天上午参观了全国农业展览会。
    在参观中，贵宾们对中国的水稻发生很大的兴趣。代表团团长康·帕伏列斯库说，中国是种稻子最早的国家，有丰富的经验。他希望中国能派专家到罗马尼亚去。陪同贵宾们参观的农业部副部长杨显东表示，中国很愿意这样做。他还说，罗马尼亚的玉米，是世界闻名的，中国热望向罗马尼亚学习这方面的经验。
    罗马尼亚在供应农业拖拉机方面曾经给予中国很大帮助。在今天参观中，客人们看到了来自罗马尼亚的拖拉机，并在拖拉机前同中国主人合影留念。
    在参观热带作物馆时，杨显东告诉客人，有位保加利亚的专家曾说，中国的这些热带作物应该是所有兄弟国家的共同财产。康·帕伏列斯库含笑表示同意，并说，特别是对于没有热带和亚热带的国家来说，这是宝贵的财产。
    参观以后，全国农业展览会向客人赠送了礼品。
    代表团全体人员在展览会的纪念簿上留言说：“在参观了人民中国的农业展览会以后，从富有艺术性和教育意义的和新颖形式介绍出来的中国的丰富资源，以及中国人民在共产党领导下开发和利用这些资源的力量和智慧，给了我们以深刻的印象。我们深信，这个展览会一定能充分达到它的目的：鼓舞人民建设社会主义的热情。祝中国所有劳动者为了他们的幸福和人类和平而作的努力获得成功。”
    今天陪同代表团参观的，还有中共中央委员、全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员王维舟，北京市副市长乐松生和罗马尼亚驻中国大使乔洛尤等。
