    Can't Fool the Japanese
    According to an Associated Press report on May 8, the American newspaper "Pacific Stars and Stripes" published an article urging American soldiers stationed in Japan to respect the Japanese and not treat them as an inferior race. The newspaper proposed several ways for the American army to please the Japanese: first, be polite to the Japanese and treat them as "equals"; second, avoid saying that "American-made" products are better than Japanese goods; third, criticize Japanese and Japanese goods less and praise them more.
    After the war, incidents of American troops insulting the Japanese people occurred frequently, causing uncontrollable anger among the Japanese people. General MacArthur, the first commander-in-chief of the American occupation forces in Japan, said that "the intelligence of the Japanese is only that of a twelve-year-old child." The current American ambassador to Japan, MacArthur II, said, "Japanese-American relations are like a married couple," and some Americans even said that "Japan is a country of collective prostitution." As for the brutal and licentious behavior of the American troops stationed in Japan, even Kunzli, the general secretary of the American Federation of Teachers who came to Japan for inspection, admitted that it was "chilling." However, what the Japanese people hate even more is that the United States regards Japan as a base for aggression and a colony, and also wants to use the Japanese as cannon fodder. Even Japanese children can see this very clearly.
    An article titled "Listen to the Voices of Children" in the Japanese "Yomiuri Weekly" published on March 3 this year reported the views of junior high school students in Sunagawa-cho on American aggressive policies. Please see the table below:

   "Pacific Stars and Stripes" is an American armed forces newspaper published under the U.S. Army News Plan and distributed in Japan, South Korea, and Okinawa. Its call for the U.S. military to implement the above regulations in order to please the Japanese with smiling faces precisely proves that the U.S. military stationed in Japan is acting recklessly, which has aroused a surge in anti-American sentiment among the Japanese. However, the measures proposed by the "Pacific Stars and Stripes" cannot deceive the Japanese people because it does not touch on the fundamental issues in Japanese-American relations, and therefore cannot alleviate the Japanese people's opposition to the American military. What the Japanese people want is independence, autonomy, and peace, not the hypocritical benevolence of the American weasel mourning the chicken. If the U.S. military authorities stationed in Japan truly respect the Japanese people, they should have already discovered what they should do. In the words of the Japanese people, that is, "Yankees go home!" (Pei)

    骗不了日本人
    据美联社5月8日报道，美国“太平洋星条报”载文，要驻在日本的美国军人尊重日本人，不要把日本人当作劣等民族。这家报纸向美国军队提出几项办法来讨好日本人：第一，对日本人要有礼貌，要以“平等”相待；第二，避免把“美国制”的东西说成比日本货好；第三，对日本和对日本货要少批评，多赞扬。
    战后，美国驻军侮辱日本人的事层出不穷，引起了日本人民不可遏止的愤怒。美国第一任驻日本占领军总司令麦克阿瑟就说过，“日本人的智慧只有十二岁小孩的程度”，美国现任驻日大使麦克阿瑟第二说，“日美关系如夫妇”，更有些美国人说“日本是集体卖淫的国家”。至于驻日美军的残暴淫乱行为，连到日本考察的美国教师联合会总书记库恩兹利都承认是“令人不寒而栗”的。然而，更为日本人民所痛恨的是，美国把日本当作侵略基地和殖民地，还要把日本人当作炮灰。这是连日本小孩子都看得很清楚的。
    今年3月3日出版的日本“读卖周刊”上有一篇“听听孩子们的声音”的文章，报道了砂川町中学生对美国侵略政策的看法，请看下表：
   “太平洋星条报”是根据美国陆军新闻计划而出版的美国武装部队报纸，销行在日本、南朝鲜和冲绳岛等地。它要美军执行上面那些规定，以笑脸讨好日本人，正好证明了驻日本的美军是胡作非为的，已经引起了日本人的反美情绪的高涨。但是，“太平洋星条报”所提出的那些办法，是欺骗不了日本人的，因为它完全没有接触到日美关系中的根本问题，从而也就不能缓和日本人民对美军的反对态度。日本人民要的是独立自主，要的是和平，而不要美国的黄鼠狼哭鸡似的假仁假义。驻日美军当局若是真正尊重日本人民，早就应当发现他们所应该作的事情，用日本人的话来说，那就是“美国佬滚回去”！（裴）
