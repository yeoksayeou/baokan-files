Hesitation in Shooting Leads to Missed Opportunities
Our Football Team Instructor Dai Linjing Discusses the Situation in Jakarta

(Reported by this newspaper) After our national football team competed against the Indonesian football team in Jakarta for the 1958 World Cup qualifying match, they returned to Beijing by plane yesterday afternoon. Team instructor Dai Linjing spoke to reporters at the airport about the course of the match against the Indonesian team.

Dai Linjing said: "The weather in Jakarta was very hot, and the players were not used to it. From 11 am to 3 pm every day, most of them had fevers and couldn't sleep well at night, which affected their appetite. Although the food was very good, they didn't enjoy it. On the day of the match, the temperature was 81 degrees Fahrenheit. In the first half of the match, our team constantly attacked the opponent's penalty area, and three shots hit the goalposts. However, in most cases, the timing and position of the players' shots were inappropriate, either too late or too far away. There were six or seven balls that should have been shot in the penalty area, but the forwards hesitated and missed the opportunities. In the first half, although the Indonesian team broke through our defense several times, their shots were either too high or off target. Several well-known Indonesian football referees said that our team had an absolute advantage in the first half."

Dai Linjing said: "Before the second half started, I pointed out to the whole team that they must shoot near the opponent's goal. At the start of the match, our team was more confident and immediately launched an attack, but the retreat was slow, creating a weakness in the defensive line. Two minutes into the match, the opponent's defender lofted a high ball into our penalty area. Goalkeeper Zhang Junxiu jumped up to catch it, but because he jumped too far forward, the ball slipped past his left shoulder. At this time, center-back Wang Defa had already filled the gap and kicked the ball to the left, where the opponent's right winger, Sayali, caught up. He passed the ball short to the center, and center forward Rahman took the opportunity to shoot hard while Zhang Junxiu had not yet retreated, and the ball went into the net from the right corner. Although our team conceded a goal, the players' confidence was still very strong, and they even scored a goal, but it was disallowed due to offside. Due to eagerness for success, shortcomings emerged. The distance between the midfielders and forwards was too far. When the midfielders got the ball, they had to dribble it themselves, dribbling it to the opponent's heavily defended area before passing it to the forwards, and as a result, the ball was often stolen by the opponent. Thirty-five minutes into the match, the opponent's defender used the "old trick" again, lofting the ball long to the front court. Left winger Lan Li cleverly crossed the ball, and our team's center-back Wang Defa made a mistake in trying to intercept the ball. Again, Rahman got the ball and went straight in, lightly kicking the second goal with his left foot from the left side. After winning two goals, the Indonesian team strengthened their defense and played steadily. Although our team had attacks and shots, none of them were effective."

Dai Linjing finally said that the Indonesian team's fast changes in attack and defense are something we can learn a lot from. The main reasons for our team's failure were the excessive distance between the midfielders and forwards, the lack of support, excessive dribbling, and the incorrect timing and position of the shots.

### 射门犹豫不决坐失良机  我足球队指导戴麟经谈在雅加达比赛情况

    射门犹豫不决坐失良机
    我足球队指导戴麟经谈在雅加达比赛情况
    本报讯　我国足球队在雅加达同印度尼西亚足球队进行了1958年世界足球锦标赛预选赛后，已经在昨天下午乘飞机回到北京。球队指导戴麟经在机场同记者谈了这次同印度尼西亚队比赛的经过。
    戴麟经说：雅加达的天气很热，队员都不习惯，每天上午十一点到下午三点，大部分人都发烧，晚上觉也睡不好，因此影响了口胃，菜饭虽然很好，但是吃得不香。比赛那天，气温是华氏八十一度，在上半场的比赛中，我队曾不断进攻到对方禁区，并且有三次射门球都打中了柱子。可是更多的情况是，队员射门的时机和位置不适当，不是迟了就是距离远了点，在禁区内应射的球有六、七个，但前锋犹豫不决，坐失良机。上半场，虽然印度尼西亚队也曾几次突破我防线，但射门都高了或偏了。有几个知名的印度尼西亚足球裁判都说我队在上半场占了绝对优势。
    戴麟经说：下半场开始前，我向全队指出必须在对方大门附近射门。比赛开始时我队信心更足，立即发起进攻，但是回守缓慢，造成后卫力量的空虚。比赛开始到两分钟时，对方后卫长吊一高球到我禁区，守门员张俊秀跃起扑接，但因跳得过于向前，球从左肩漏过。这时中卫王德发已经补了空，一脚把球踢到左面，对方右翼沙亚利正好赶上，他把球短传到中间，中锋拉曼趁张俊秀尚未退回时举脚猛射，球从右角入网。我队虽失一球，但队员信心还是很强，并且曾经踢进了一个球，但因越位无效。由于求功心切，缺点出现了，前卫和前锋距离太远，前卫得球只好自己带入，带到对方布防严密的地方再传给前锋，结果球往往被对方抢去。比赛进行到三十五分钟时，对方后卫又用“老一手”把球长吊前场，左翼蓝礼巧妙传中，我队中卫王德发抢球失误，又是对方拉曼得球直入，用左脚从左边轻轻打入第二个球。印度尼西亚队胜两球后，即加强后卫，稳扎稳打，我队虽有进攻和射门但都未奏效。
    戴麟经最后说，印度尼西亚队进攻和防守变换快，这点大大值得我们学习。我队失败主要原因是前卫和前锋距离过远，接应不上、盘球过多，以及射门的时机和位置不正确。
