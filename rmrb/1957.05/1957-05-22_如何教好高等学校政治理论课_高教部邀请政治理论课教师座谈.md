    How to Teach Political Theory Courses Well in Higher Education
    The Ministry of Higher Education Invites Political Theory Course Teachers to a Forum
    (Our Newspaper) News: The Ministry of Higher Education invited political theory course teachers from universities and colleges to a forum on the 21st to discuss improving political theory courses. Vice Minister Liu Zizai of the Ministry of Higher Education presided over the meeting.

    Many political theory course teachers said that political theory courses in universities and colleges have not received the attention they deserve. From school leaders to students, there is a widespread phenomenon of underestimating political theory courses. Xu Zhou of Taiyuan Institute of Technology said that political theory course teachers cannot see any documents or hear any reports. Si Rong of Inner Mongolia Normal College said that not only can they not see any documents or hear any reports, but the school leaders won't even subscribe to a copy of the People's Daily. This problem has not been resolved to this day. Wang Tuo of Guangxi Normal College said, how can political theory teachers continuously improve their ideological and political level if they can't hear reports?

    The low quality of political theory course teaching is a common problem in many universities and colleges. In teaching, they are divorced from the current actual struggles, divorced from the students' ideological level, and some even read directly from the textbook, mechanically applying dogma. Many teachers at the meeting raised their opinions on this issue. Ni Shouxi of Sichuan University suggested that a group of cadres with a certain theoretical level and practical struggle experience should be transferred to strengthen the leading backbone and teaching force of the political theory course teaching and research offices in various schools, and to cultivate and improve the existing teachers' level. Many teachers agreed with Ni Shouxi's opinion. They said that school leaders can also undertake part of the teaching tasks, which can not only closely connect with the masses but also strengthen the teaching force. In order to better improve the teaching quality of existing political theory course teachers, many teachers suggested organizing in-service teacher training, organizing them to participate in social and political work, strengthening their connection with students, organizing them to participate in practical exercises in rural areas, factories, and mines, and providing them with the necessary materials for teaching. The teachers suggested that the Ministry of Higher Education compile teaching syllabi and political theory textbooks that are combined with China's reality, and resolve the problems of repetition and excessive workload in teaching content as soon as possible.

    Many teachers criticized the bureaucratic work style of the Ministry of Higher Education for not going deep into the grassroots.

    如何教好高等学校政治理论课
    高教部邀请政治理论课教师座谈
    本报讯　高等教育部在21日，邀请高等学校政治理论课教师座谈改进政治理论课的问题。座谈会由刘子载副部长主持。
    许多政治理论课教师说，政治理论课在高等学校里没有受到应有的重视，从学校领导直到学生，普遍存在着轻视政治理论课的现象。太原工学院徐舟说，政治理论课教师什么文件看不到，报告也听不到。内蒙师范学院斯荣说，别说什么文件看不到，报告也听不到，连一份人民日报，学校领导上还不给订。这个问题直到今天还未解决。广西师范学院王拓说，政治理论教师听不到报告，这怎能不断提高自己的思想政治水平呢？
    政治理论课教学质量不高，这是许多高等学校普遍存在的问题。在教学当中脱离当前的实际斗争，脱离学生的思想水平，有的甚至照本宣读，搬弄教条。到会许多教师就这个问题提出了意见。四川大学倪受禧说，建议调配一批具有一定理论水平、又有实际斗争经验的干部，充实各个学校政治理论课教研室的领导骨干和教学力量，培养提高现有的教师水平。许多教师都同意倪受禧的意见。他们说，学校领导同志，也可担负一部分教学任务，既可密切联系群众，又可充实教学的力量。为了更好地提高现有政治理论课教师的教学质量，许多教师建议组织在职教师进修，组织他们参加社会政治工作，加强他们与学生的联系，组织他们到农村、工厂、矿山参加实际锻炼，供给他们在教学上必用的资料。教师们建议高等教育部编写结合中国实际的教学大纲和政治理论教科书，以及尽快解决教学内容上重复和分量过重的问题。
    许多教师对高等教育部不深入下层的官僚主义作风提出了批评。
