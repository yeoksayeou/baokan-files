    The "Distrustful" Dog
    Two American doctors recently conducted a very interesting experiment. They transplanted four hearts from other animals into a dog. The five hearts in the dog all beat and pumped blood together. Several of the transplanted hearts continued to beat for as long as ten days.
    The four transplanted hearts were placed in the following locations: two were installed on either side of the dog's head and neck, and the other two were installed in the groin area at the top of the dog's hind legs.
    The purpose of their experiment was to determine the factors that hinder the successful transplantation of human hearts.

    “多心”的狗
    美国有两个医生最近作了一个非常有趣的试验，他们在一只狗身上移植了其他动物的四颗心脏，狗身上五颗心脏一起跳动，输送血液，移植的心脏中有几颗一直保持跳动了十天之久。
    这四颗心移植的位置是：两颗装在狗的头颈的两侧，另外两颗装在狗的后腿上端的鼠蹊部分。
    他们作这个试验的目的，是要确定妨碍顺利地移植人的心脏的因素。
