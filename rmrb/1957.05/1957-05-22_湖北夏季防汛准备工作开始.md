Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan Telegram: Hubei Province, having safely passed the peach blossom flood season of the Yangtze and Han Rivers, has now begun intensive preparations for summer flood prevention.

Currently, special districts and counties along the rivers and lakes of Hubei Province have successively convened "Four Prevention" (flood prevention, drought prevention, waterlogging prevention, mountain torrent prevention) work conferences and established flood control command organizations at all levels. Various localities are organizing efforts to inspect the renovation of dikes and the preparation of flood control materials. The province's general survey of dike conditions has been basically completed. In Wuhan City, which has consistently faced heavy flood control tasks, Deputy Mayor Wu Nengguang, along with the heads of the Water Conservancy Bureau, inspected the more than fifty-kilometer-long dikes surrounding the city on the 17th. Based on past flood control experience and this year's actual situation, the Jingzhou Special District has already formulated a plan for mobilizing labor for flood control. Regarding flood control materials, all localities have begun to inventory and sun-dry stockpiled materials and purchase missing equipment, based on the principles of "using local materials and replenishing what is lacking." To strengthen technical guidance for "Four Prevention" work, all localities are holding short-term training courses or seminars to summarize past experience and improve the technical skills of cadres and the masses. This year, flood forecasting work has also been improved and enhanced.

    湖北夏季防汛准备工作开始
    新华社武汉电　已经安全度过长江、汉水桃汛期的湖北省，夏季防汛的准备工作又紧张地开始了。
    现在湖北省沿江滨湖各专区、县已经相继召开“四防”（防汛、防旱、防涝、防山洪）工作会议，建立了各级防汛指挥机构。各地正在组织力量，检查堤防整修和防汛器材筹集的情况。全省堤情普测工作已经基本完成。在历年防汛任务较重的武汉市，副市长伍能光同水利局负责人在17日巡视了环绕全市的五十多公里长的堤防。荆州专区根据历年防汛的经验和今年的实际情况，已经制定了防汛调动劳动力的计划。对于防汛器材，各地都根据“就地取材和缺啥补啥”的原则，开始清点和翻晒库存物资，添购所缺器材。为加强“四防”工作的技术指导，各地都举办短期训练班或座谈会，总结历年的经验，提高干部和群众的技术水平。今年防汛情报工作也有改进和提高。
