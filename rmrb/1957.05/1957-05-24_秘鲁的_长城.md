    There is also a Great Wall in the Republic of Peru. It stretches from the source of the Rio de Supe to near Lima, the capital of Peru, a total length of 300 kilometers, and is entirely built of brick. Round fortresses are built at regular intervals along the Great Wall. This Great Wall is a 16th-century structure.

    秘鲁的“长城”
    在秘鲁共和国也有一座长城。它起自里多得萨纳河源头至秘鲁首都利马附近止，全长三百公里，全部用砖砌成。在长城的每隔一定距离内筑有圆形堡垒。这个长城是十六世纪的建筑物。
