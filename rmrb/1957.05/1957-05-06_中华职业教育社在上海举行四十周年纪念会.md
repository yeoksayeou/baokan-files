    中华职业教育社在上海举行四十周年纪念会
    新华社上海5日电　中华职业教育社5日在上海举行成立四十周年纪念会。全社的纪念活动将连续进行三天。
    中华职业教育社1917年在上海由当时的工业界和教育界知名人士创办的。解放前，这个社在上海、重庆等地举办了好几所职业学校、补习学校，并且创办“生活周刊”、“救国通讯”（国讯）等刊物，对启蒙青年、培养青年起了很大作用。解放后，总社迁到北京，继续在北京、上海、昆明举办函授师范教育、基本生产技术教育等。
    中华职业教育社理事长黄炎培在纪念会上说，这次纪念会除了总结过去四十年经验以外，还将确定今后的任务：继续举办函授师范教育、基本生产技术教育等，并且将开办学校，吸收中小学生入学。
