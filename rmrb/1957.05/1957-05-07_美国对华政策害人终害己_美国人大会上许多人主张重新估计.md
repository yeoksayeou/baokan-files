Xinhua News Agency, 6th dispatch from New York: The "American Assembly," attended by important figures from American business, political, and scientific circles, recently held its semi-annual meeting. Some people at the meeting advocated re-evaluating the U.S. policy toward China. According to "New York Times" reporter Salisbury, some at this conference, organized by Columbia University, believe that the current U.S. policy toward China "may ultimately harm others and harm itself," and that "this policy currently not only restricts America's actions on the China issue, but also does so regarding the entire Far East." They said, "If we continue to strive to maintain the status quo, we are likely to fail in the end, and the impact, from the perspective of American goals, will be very unfortunate." These people believe that in order to eventually reach a settlement with China, American Asian policy may need a "complete re-evaluation."

"New York Herald Tribune" reporter Chapman also reported that some of those attending the meeting insisted that the United States should reach "at least a partial settlement" with the Chinese government to reduce the possibility of war in Korea or Taiwan.

It is reported that seventy-five important figures from business, government, and scientific circles attended the conference, including Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Rostow, former Marshall Plan executive Hoffman, Rockefeller Foundation Board of Trustees Chairman Rusk, and former U.S. Middle East envoy Johnston.

    美国对华政策害人终害己
    美国人大会上许多人主张重新估计
    新华社6日讯　纽约消息：由有美国企业界、政界和科学界重要人物参加的“美国人大会”最近举行半年一度的会议，有些人在会上主张重新估计美国对中国的政策问题。据“纽约时报”记者索耳兹伯里报道，在这个哥伦比亚大学组织的大会上有些人认为，美国目前对中国的政策“最后可能害人害己”，“这个政策目前不但在对中国的问题上束缚了美国的手脚，而且在对整个远东方面说来也如此”。他们说，“如果继续力求维持现状的话，最后很可能遭到失败，其影响从美国目标的观点来看将是非常不幸的。”这些人认为，为了最后同中国达成解决，美国的亚洲政策可能需要作“全盘的重新估计”。
    “纽约先驱论坛报”记者查普曼也报道，参加这次会议的有些人坚持，美国应该同中国政府取得“至少是部分的解决，以减少在朝鲜或者台湾发生战争的可能性”。
    据报道，出席这次大会的有七十五个企业界、政府和科学界的重要人物，其中包括马萨诸塞理工学院教授罗斯托、前马歇尔计划执行人霍夫曼、洛克菲勒基金保管委员会主席鲁斯克和前美国驻中东特使约翰斯顿。
