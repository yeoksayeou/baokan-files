    Demanding a Halt to Hydrogen Bomb Tests and Preventing the Threat of Atomic War
    Public Opinion in Various Countries Continues to Voice Righteous Calls
    Atomic Scientists Publish Open Letter; British Women March and Demonstrate in the Rain
    Atomic Scientists
    (Xinhua News Agency report) According to Xinhua News Agency: Public opinion in various countries continues to voice righteous calls, opposing nuclear weapons testing and demanding a halt to hydrogen bomb tests.
    Twelve Soviet, Polish, Chinese, Czechoslovak, Mongolian, and Romanian scientists from the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Moscow have published an open letter, calling for an end to the threat of atomic war.
    These scientists said, "We warmly support the steps taken in the past and present by the governments of the Soviet Union, China, Poland, Romania, and other countries in various organizations, including the United Nations, aimed at prohibiting the use and testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons. Regrettably, the proposal to ban nuclear weapons testing has not yet been supported by some countries."
    "We firmly advocate the prohibition of atomic weapons and urge all countries to reach a rapid agreement on the immediate cessation of atomic and hydrogen bomb tests because we believe that any atomic war, no matter where it breaks out, will inevitably turn into a global atomic war, and the consequences of such a war for modern humanity will be devastating."
    These scientists expressed their support for the West German scientists who oppose the atomic weapons arms race. They said, "Our West German colleagues have very timely exposed a myth that attempts to paralyze people's vigilance: the notion that so-called tactical atomic weapons are not among the weapons of mass destruction but are merely a type of conventional weapon." The open letter argues that even if only tactical atomic weapons were used in the course of military operations, the extent of the suffering of the citizens of those countries involved in the war would be very great, and the consequences would be no less severe than the disasters already suffered by the residents of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
    Burmese Peace Leader
    Thakin Kodaw Hmaing, Chairman of the Burmese Committee for the Defense of World Peace, and other leaders of the organization have called on the Burmese people to protest against atomic nuclear weapons tests. They said that atomic weapons are bound to destroy all of humanity and will not guarantee human welfare.
    British Women
    Nearly a thousand British women wearing black shirts marched in the pouring rain on the afternoon of the 12th to protest the government's planned hydrogen bomb tests. They carried placards protesting hydrogen bomb tests, marching from Hyde Park through the city center to Trafalgar Square. Some mothers also participated in the march with their children and strollers.
    The march was organized by the recently established National Council for the Abolition of Nuclear Weapons. Some of the women participating in the march have been going to Parliament every day recently to meet with members of Parliament and demand a ban on nuclear weapons testing.
    Behind the women's march was a contingent of veterans, who also carried placards expressing their opposition to hydrogen bomb tests.
    In Trafalgar Square, Labour MPs Summerskill and Mrs. Joyce Butler addressed the marchers. Mrs. Butler pointed out that women used to leave political affairs to men, but now they have risen up to fight against hydrogen weapons that threaten peace.
    Italian General Confederation of Labour
    According to TASS, Rome, May 12: The Secretariat of the Italian General Confederation of Labour has called on international trade union organizations and various Italian trade union organizations to appeal to the governments of all countries to immediately halt nuclear weapons tests and to hold talks on the immediate destruction of all existing weapons of mass destruction and the signing of a universal disarmament agreement.
    It made this request in letters to the World Federation of Trade Unions, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, the Christian Trade Union Federation, the Italian Confederation of Workers' Trade Unions, and the Italian Labour Union.

    要求停止氢弹试验　制止原子战争威胁
    世界各国舆论继续发出正义呼声
    原子科学家发表公开信　英国妇女冒雨游行示威
    原子科学家
    本报综合报道　据新华社消息：世界各国舆论继续发出正义的呼声，反对试验核武器，要求停止试验氢弹。
    莫斯科联合原子核研究所的十二位苏联、波兰、中国、捷克斯洛伐克、蒙古和罗马尼亚科学家发表了一封公开信，号召制止原子战争的威胁。
    这些科学家们说，我们热烈地支持苏联、中国、波兰、罗马尼亚和其他国家的政府过去和现在在包括联合国在内的各种组织中所采取的以禁止使用和试验原子武器和氢武器为目的的一切步骤。遗憾的是，禁止试验核武器的建议直到现在还没有得到一些国家的支持。
    我们坚决主张禁止原子武器，主张各国迅速达成关于立即停止试验原子弹和氢弹的协议，因为我们考虑到，在任何地方爆发任何原子战争，都必然会变成世界性的原子战争，而这种战争给现代人类带来的后果将是惨重的。
    这些科学家对反对原子武器军备竞赛的西德科学家表示支持。他们说，我们的西德同人非常及时地揭穿了一种企图麻痹人民警惕性的神话：似乎所谓战术原子武器不属于大规模杀人武器之列，而只是一种常规武器。公开信认为，如果在军事行动的过程中即使只使用战术上的原子武器，被卷入战争的那些国家的公民的受灾范围也将是非常大的，其后果并不会比广岛和长崎居民所已经遭受到的灾难来得小。
    缅甸和平领袖
    缅甸保卫世界和平委员会主席德钦哥都迈和这个组织的其他领导人呼吁缅甸人民抗议原子核武器试验。他们说，原子武器势必会毁灭全人类，而不会保障人类的福利。
      英国妇女
    将近一千名穿着黑衫的英国妇女在12日下午冒着倾盆大雨举行游行，抗议政府预定的氢弹试验。她们拿着抗议氢弹试验的标语牌，从海德公园穿过市中心区走到特拉法加广场。有些母亲们还带着孩子、推着儿童车参加游行。
    游行是由不久前成立的争取禁止核武器全国委员会组织的。一些参加游行的妇女，近日来每天到议会去，会见议员，要求禁止核武器试验。
    妇女游行行列的后面是退伍军人队伍，他们也拿着表示反对氢弹试验的标语牌。
    在特拉法加广场上，工党女议员萨末斯基尔和焦伊斯·巴特勒夫人对游行者发表演说。巴特勒夫人指出，妇女从前惯于把政治事务让给男人，现在已经起来为反对威胁和平的氢武器而斗争了。
    意大利总工会
    据塔斯社罗马12日讯：意大利总工会书记处要求国际工会组织以及意大利各个工会组织向各国政府呼吁，以便达到立刻停止核武器试验，并且举行关于立即销毁一切现存的大规模毁灭性武器以及签订裁军的普遍协定的会谈。
    它在致世界工会联合会、国际自由工会联合会、基督教工会联合会、意大利劳动人民工会联合会以及意大利劳工联盟的信件中提出这个要求。
