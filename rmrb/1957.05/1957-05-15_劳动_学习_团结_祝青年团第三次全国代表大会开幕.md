    Labor created mankind, and created human history and culture. Our country is still very poor, and only through labor, especially physical labor, can it gradually become prosperous. The vast number of young workers in our country are working gloriously with adults on the industrial and agricultural fronts to create a happy life for the people. The vast number of young students are also studying in preparation for participating in productive labor. However, there are still some young people who do not fully recognize the significance of physical labor, and even despise it. Therefore, one of the primary tasks of the Communist Youth League is to combat the remnants of this exploitative class ideology that despises physical labor. Those young people who are already engaged in industrial and agricultural labor should be educated and encouraged to engage in physical labor with peace of mind for a long time; those young people who have not yet participated in labor should be educated and encouraged to actively prepare to participate in physical labor; those young people who are engaged in mental labor should also be educated not to despise physical labor, and should be encouraged to participate in some physical labor whenever possible. All members of the Youth League should become models of participating in physical labor; whether a League member loves labor can be used to judge whether he or she truly has communist consciousness.
    To achieve this, Youth League cadres need to lead by example. All Youth League cadres who are divorced from production and physical labor should participate in physical labor for a certain period of time each year. Moreover, we also believe that in the future, all Youth League cadres should preferably be promoted from young workers and young farmers who directly participate in physical labor and have a certain level of education.
    The main task of young people is to study. Young people on the labor front must also study in labor. They must not only learn professional skills, but also study politics.
    Every member of the Communist Youth League must study and promote the Marxist-Leninist worldview, and must study and promote the communist outlook on life. The important thing in studying Marxism-Leninism is not just being able to recite its words, but to truly understand its spirit and apply it in practice. It is necessary to pay attention to discovering problems in labor, work, study, and life, using Marxist-Leninist methods to study and solve these problems, and learn to use vivid reasoning methods to persuade young people who do not agree with Marxism-Leninism.
    One of the learning tasks of Youth League members is to inherit the communist moral qualities of revolutionary predecessors, love the people, work hard, not care about personal interests, and not be afraid of difficulties and setbacks. Our socialist revolution has not yet been finally completed, and bourgeois ideology still has a non-negligible influence among young people. The tendencies of selfishness, greed for enjoyment, and lack of principles and ideals are clear examples of the influence of bourgeois ideology. The task of the Youth League is to effectively sweep away these spiritual garbage left over from the old society through political study among young people.
    The task of the Communist Youth League is both noble and arduous. Obviously, its task can only be accomplished when it truly becomes the core of unity for young people across the country.
    The Youth League has achieved significant results in uniting the young generation of our country, but it also has shortcomings of sectarianism. Especially in the current situation, the class struggle in our country has basically ended, and the great unity of all young people in our country has gained a broader space, the demand to overcome the shortcomings of sectarianism in the work of the Youth League is even more urgent.
    The Youth League only has the obligation to care for and help young people, and has absolutely no right to be proud and look down on them. Youth League members should treat young people outside the League as their own brothers and friends, and share their fate. Youth League members should admit that young people outside the League have many advantages that are worth learning from, and should also admit that they have many shortcomings that need the supervision and help of young people outside the League. At the same time, the Youth League must pay attention to understanding and reflecting the opinions of the young people and represent their reasonable demands and legitimate interests. Contradictions among the people have become the main contradiction in the country, and this change is of course also reflected in youth issues. As the Party's assistant, the Youth League should play its due role in regulating the contradictions between young people and the state.
    Labor, study, unity, this is the fighting slogan of the Communist Youth League, and it is also the fighting slogan of the youth of the whole country. We believe that the discussion of these fighting tasks at the Third National Congress of the Youth League will promote the upsurge of labor enthusiasm and communist consciousness of the youth of the whole country, and will greatly strengthen the patriotic unity of the youth of the whole country.

### 劳动·学习·团结  祝青年团第三次全国代表大会开幕

    劳动·学习·团结
    祝青年团第三次全国代表大会开幕
    中国新民主主义青年团第三次全国代表大会今天开幕了。通过这次大会，青年团将根据变化了的国内形势，根据广大团员的愿望，改名为中国共产主义青年团，从而走上新的发展阶段。我们愿就青年团在新的发展阶段的三项基本任务——劳动、学习和团结，说一点我们的意见，作为对这次大会的献礼。
    劳动创造了人类，创造了人类的历史和文化。我们的国家现在还很穷，只有经过劳动，首先是体力劳动，才能逐渐富裕。我国的广大的劳动青年，正在同成年人在一起，在工农业战线上为创造人民的幸福生活而光荣地努力。广大的青年学生，也正在为准备参加生产劳动而学习。但是也还有一部分青年还不完全认识体力劳动的意义，甚至轻视体力劳动。因此，共产主义青年团的首要任务之一，就是要同这种轻视体力劳动的剥削阶级思想的残余作斗争。对那些正在从事工农业劳动的青年，应该教育和鼓励他们安心地长期地从事体力劳动；对那些还没有参加劳动的青年，应该教育和鼓励他们积极地准备参加体力劳动；对那些专门从事脑力劳动的青年，也应该教育他们不要轻视体力劳动，而且鼓励他们只要有可能，也参加一部分体力劳动。所有青年团员，都应该成为参加体力劳动的模范；从一个团员是否热爱劳动，可以判断他是否真正具有共产主义的觉悟。
    为了作到这一点，青年团的干部需要以身作则。一切脱离生产、脱离体力劳动的青年团的干部，每年都应该有一定的时间参加体力劳动。而且，我们还认为，今后青年团的所有干部，最好都从直接参加体力劳动而又有一定的文化水平的青年工人、青年农民中提拔。
    青年的主要任务是学习。在劳动战线上的青年，同样要在劳动中学习。不但要学习业务，而且要学习政治。
    共产主义青年团的每一个团员都必须学习和宣传马克思列宁主义的世界观，都必须学习和宣传共产主义的人生观。学习马克思列宁主义，重要的不是仅仅会背诵它的字句，而是要真正领会它的精神，并且在实践中加以运用。要认真注意在劳动、工作、学习、生活中发现问题，运用马克思列宁主义的方法，研究和解决这些问题，并且学会用生动的说理的方法，说服那些不同意马克思列宁主义的青年。
    青年团员的学习任务之一，是要继承革命前辈的共产主义的道德品质，热爱人民，艰苦奋斗，不计较个人利益，不害怕困难和挫折。我国的社会主义革命还没有最后完成，资产阶级思想在青年中间还有不容忽视的影响。那些自私自利、贪图享受、不要原则和理想的倾向，就是资产阶级思想影响的显明的例证。青年团的任务就是通过政治的学习，在青年中间有效地清扫这些旧社会所遗留下来的精神上的垃圾。
    共产主义青年团的任务是崇高而又艰巨的。很明显，它的任务只有在它真正成为全国青年团结的核心的时候，才有可能完成。
    青年团在团结我国青年一代的工作中得到了重大的成绩，但是也还有宗派主义的缺点。特别在目前的形势下，我国国内的阶级斗争已经基本结束，我国全体青年的大团结已经得到了更广阔的天地，克服青年团工作中的宗派主义缺点的要求，也就更加迫切了。
    青年团对青年群众只有关心和帮助的义务，决没有骄傲和瞧不起的权利。青年团员要把团外青年当作自己的兄弟和朋友，要和他们同呼吸、共命运。青年团员应该承认团外青年有很多优点，值得自己学习，也应该承认自己有不少缺点，需要团外青年的监督和帮助。同时，青年团必须注意了解和反映青年群众的意见，并代表他们的合理的要求和正当的利益。人民内部矛盾已经成为国内主要的矛盾，这种变化当然也反映在青年问题上。作为党的助手的青年团，应该在调节青年和国家的矛盾上发挥应有的作用。
    劳动，学习，团结，这是共产主义青年团的战斗口号，这也是全国青年的战斗口号。我们相信，青年团第三次全国代表大会对于这些战斗任务的讨论，必将推动全国青年劳动积极性的高涨和共产主义觉悟的高涨，并且将大大加强全国青年的爱国团结。
