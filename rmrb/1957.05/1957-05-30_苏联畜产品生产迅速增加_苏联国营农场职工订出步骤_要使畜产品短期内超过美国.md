Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 29th: The Soviet Union's procurement of meat and milk in the first four months of this year reached 689,000 tons and 3,967,000 tons respectively, an increase of 48% and 25% respectively compared to the same period last year.

The first few months of each year are an unfavorable period for meat procurement because there is generally a lack of feed in winter and grazing in the fields is not possible, making livestock relatively weak. Therefore, the majority of procurement work is carried out in the second half of each year. The achievements made in procurement work in the first four months of this year indicate that even greater achievements will be made in the second half of the year.

In recent years, the Soviet Union has made significant achievements in livestock production. The average milk yield per cow on collective farms throughout the Soviet Union increased by only 67 kilograms between 1945 and 1953, while in the single economic year of 1955-1956, it increased by 337 kilograms. In 1956, milk production on Soviet collective farms and state farms increased by 76% compared to 1953, with collective farms almost doubling their production; the national production of animal fats also increased by 45%.

The livestock production of some collective farms has increased very rapidly in recent years. In Kalinovka Village, Kursk Oblast, the collective farm produced 8 quintals of meat per 100 hectares of land in 1953, which increased to 31 quintals in 1955, 60 quintals in 1956, and this year the farm guarantees an increase to 90 quintals. The "18th Party Congress" collective farm near Leningrad obtained 108 quintals of milk per 100 hectares of land in 1953, which increased to 270 quintals in 1956, and this year it will increase to 350 quintals.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 29th: All staff and workers of Soviet state farms have decided to catch up with and surpass the United States in terms of per capita livestock product output within a few years. Their goal is to produce 100 to 150 quintals of meat and 400 to 600 quintals of milk per 100 hectares of agricultural land in the short term.

According to Comrade Khrushchev's calculations, the Soviet Union can catch up with the United States if it produces 42 quintals of meat (net weight) and 141 quintals of milk per 100 hectares of agricultural land. This target was set based on the development and speed of state farms in recent years. Currently, Soviet state farms have a total of 52 million hectares of cultivated land, compared to only 16 million hectares in 1953. This year, the sown area of state farms has reached 46 million hectares. Last year, state farms delivered more than 930 million poods of grain to the state, which is 3.6 times more than in 1953.

In terms of livestock products, the output of state farms is also constantly increasing. In the first four months of this year, state farms delivered 29% more milk and 58% more meat to the state than in the same period last year, with pork doubling.

Last year, state farms earned a total profit of 315 million rubles, which is the highest in history.

    苏联畜产品生产迅速增加
    苏联国营农场职工订出步骤
    要使畜产品短期内超过美国
    新华社莫斯科29日电　苏联今年头四个月征购的肉类和奶类分别达到了六十八万九千吨和三百九十六万七千吨，比去年同一时期分别增加了48％和25％。
    每年头几个月是征购肉类不利的时期，因为冬季一般缺乏饲料而且不能在野外放牧，牲畜比较瘦弱，因此，征购工作大部分是在每年下半年进行的。而今年头四个月在征购工作中取得的成绩表明，在今年下半年将取得更大的成就。
    最近几年来，苏联畜产品生产取得了显著的成就。苏联全国集体农庄每头奶牛的平均挤奶量在1945年到1953年期间只增加了六十七公斤，而1955—1956年一个经济年度就增加了三百三十七公斤。1956年苏联集体农庄和国营农场的奶类产量比1953年增加了76％，其中集体农庄几乎增加了一倍；全国的动物油脂生产量也增加了45％。
    有些集体农庄的畜产品生产在最近几年来增加得非常快。库尔斯克州卡利诺夫卡村的集体农庄在1953年每一百公顷土地生产了八公担肉类，1955年就增加到三十一公担，1956年增加到六十公担，今年这个农庄保证增加到九十公担。列宁格勒附近的“第十八次党代表大会”集体农庄在1953年每一百公顷土地得到一百零八公担奶类，1956年增加到二百七十公担，今年将增加到三百五十公担。
    新华社莫斯科29日电　苏联国营农场全体职工决定在几年内使畜产品产量按人口平均计算赶上并且超过美国。他们奋斗的目标是在短期内使每一百公顷的农业用地生产肉类一百到一百五十公担，牛奶四百到六百公担。
    根据赫鲁晓夫同志的计算，苏联全国按农业用地计算，每一百公顷生产肉类（净重）四十二公担、牛奶一百四十一公担就可以赶上美国的水平。这个指标是根据最近几年来国营农场发展的情况和速度制定的。现在，苏联国营农场共拥有耕地五千二百万公顷，在1953年仅有一千六百万公顷。今年国营农场的播种面积达到四千六百万公顷。去年国营农场交给国家九亿三千多万普特谷物，比1953年多三点六倍。
    在畜产品方面，国营农场的产量也在不断提高。今年头四个月，国营农场交给国家的牛奶比去年同期增加了29％，肉类增加了58％，其中猪肉增加了一倍。
    去年，国营农场共盈利三亿一千五百万卢布，这是历年来最高的。
