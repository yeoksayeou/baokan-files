(Reported by our newspaper) Over a hundred professors and associate professors were invited by the Chinese Communist Party Committee of Tsinghua University last night to a forum. Many professors and associate professors provided valuable opinions to help the school's Party organization rectify its work style.

Welcoming the Party's Rectification Campaign

The rectification campaign at Tsinghua University has already begun. All the professors expressed their welcome and willingness to actively help the Party organization carry out the rectification. Associate Professor He Chengjun said that, as a non-Party intellectual, he felt both excited and grateful for the Party's rectification. We know that without the leadership of the Party, nothing would exist, and this is very clear. However, there are also shortcomings in our work, such as bureaucracy, sectarianism, and dogmatism. The Party's rectification aims to overcome these shortcomings and make the Party even stronger. The relationship between the Party and intellectuals is an important topic of the rectification. I hope the Party committee will set higher demands for the rectification and not be satisfied with the achievements already made.

Using Youth Movement Methods to Run Education

Habitual forces sometimes make people's thinking rigid, and it is difficult to change them for a while. Associate Professor Zhang Shouyi of the Architecture Department said that the school leadership only knows how to solve problems with the methods of launching movements and administrative orders. Associate Professor Chen Liangsheng said that the school's education work methods should be like a gentle breeze and fine rain, not a violent storm. For example, revising the teaching plan cannot be solved by a single movement; specific work is needed for each issue.

Associate Professor Li Ou said, "What habitual force is a characteristic of Tsinghua? Using the methods of launching youth movements to run school education, this has become a characteristic of Tsinghua. This characteristic has three 'mores' and three 'lesses.' The three 'mores' and three 'lesses' are: more movements, less detailed work; more task implementation, less consultation; more care for young people, less care for middle-aged and older people. The school launches movements one after another. Of course, it is necessary to have a focus, but it cannot disrupt regular work. The so-called more implementation refers to the methods of launching movements, with instructions from above and implementation below, without much consultation. It is right for the school to consider the students' problems, but it considers the teachers' problems too little."

Professor Zhang Mingtao of the Electrical Engineering Department also said that the academic atmosphere at Tsinghua is not strong enough, and is this related to the Party's leadership style? In the past, the Party was accustomed to the style of launching movements and accustomed to using this set of methods, which is now worth considering.

Unwilling to Even Sit at the Same Table to Eat

There is a wall between the Party and the masses, and it should be torn down. Some responsible Party comrades are detached from the masses. When they see other comrades on the road, they do not pay much attention to them. Why is this? Associate Professor Wan Jiahuang said that some young Party members even explained this, saying, "Because the responsible comrades are very busy and are thinking about problems even when walking, so they didn't see you!" This only creates estrangement. Also, mealtimes are a good opportunity for Party members to get close to the masses when Party members and non-Party members are together. However, it is not like this. Party members eat at one table and non-Party members at another, as if even eating has a class character, which has a very bad influence. Of course, some Party comrades are very good and can have good talks when they meet. Professor Zhang Jian said that the Party cares less and consults less with non-Party members, only asking for work.

Professor Li Heyun said that some Party comrades look up at the sky, and sometimes they do not even greet each other when they meet on the stairs. In the past, there was a teacher-student relationship, but today it is also cold. Does joining the Party make one level higher than others? Some of my former students now ignore me, truly being ungrateful. Some rising Party members have even bigger airs than the older ones. Professor Jin Xiwu of the Mechanical Manufacturing Department said, "I feel that the relationship between new and old teachers at the school is not intimate enough, not sincere enough, and not respectful enough. Some young teachers still maintain a respectful distance from the old teachers. At the same time, the different treatment of teachers by the school also affects the unity between teachers. Some teachers, after joining the Party, no longer nod when they meet on the road."

Professor Chen Liangsheng of the Water Conservancy Department said that he had never seen Party members boldly criticize and self-criticize in public. Some Party members only talk about principles but are unwilling to do specific work. We have such Party members in our department. Associate Professor Mo Zongjiang of the Architecture Department said that when someone raises an opinion to a Party member or a draft proposal, the Party member does not listen to others but explains it to them, and later everyone stops giving opinions. Party members and non-Party members do not talk to each other in daily life, only when discussing problems, and it is always very serious. The Party members in our department are not above the masses, nor in the midst of the masses, but on the side of the masses. Professor Gu Chuanhai of the Architecture Department said that the school does not care and take care of the non-Party leading cadres enough, and some are in a state of being uncared for. Participation in social and political activities was noticed in the past, but it has passed like a flash in the pan. Old Professor Ma John and Professor Tao Baokai both believe that Party and non-Party comrades should take the initiative to make contact, which will be more helpful for unity. Many professors have put forward suggestions for improving Party-masses relations.

Non-Party Cadres Have Titles But No Power

Professor Huang Wanli of the Water Conservancy Department said that having a title but no power is a common phenomenon, like an unwritten law. Everyone is used to it and does not feel anything, nor is it anything new. Professor Zhang Ren said that having a title but no power can be compared to participating more in construction but less in design. For example, the list of those sent abroad for further study is not signed and recommended by the directors of the teaching and research sections but is put forward by the higher authorities. It cannot be said that the higher authorities have not investigated and studied, but it is not as detailed and specific as the directors of the teaching and research sections know. These lists were not well discussed after they were put forward, and the same is true for the issue of promotion of members of the teaching and research sections. To give full play to the enthusiasm of the members of the teaching and research sections, it is necessary to give the department directors and teaching and research section directors titles and powers, not only to let them participate in construction but also to let them participate more in design.

Professor Li Jixiang said: "I feel that although the Party-masses relationship at Tsinghua is not like an impregnable fortress, there are still problems. For example, there is still not enough done on the point of having a title and power, and the Party manages too many things. For example, the teaching and research group is a teaching work unit, but it does not have enough work authority."

Dong Shuping said, "I think the working relationship between the Party and the administration at Tsinghua has not been well coordinated, and there is still a certain distance. Some things are only passed through the Party committee without going through the administration, lacking research and discussion."

More Consultation, More Trust, More Help

Associate Professor Fang Chongzhi of the Power Machinery Department said: "I think the Party should mainly consult and trust senior intellectuals more. At present, the Party-masses relationship at Tsinghua is generally harmonious, but the Party still regards professors as outsiders to some extent. I will give a few small examples. For example, when foreign guests come to Tsinghua for a visit, the school restricts professors from directly talking to foreign guests in foreign languages. Also, when professors give some gifts to Soviet experts, they must go through the department secretary, which actually prevents professors and Soviet experts from being closer. For example, the Ministry of Higher Education has repeatedly stated that professors should not directly contact foreigners, which is also worth considering."

Professor Wang Zunming of the Mechanical Manufacturing Department said: "In today's 'Hundred Flowers Bloom,' I feel that although the leadership of Tsinghua University has worked hard, the development of certain aspects is still not enough. For example, in terms of improving teaching quality, the school leadership has not paid enough attention to the improvement of the professional level of both young and old teachers. When Tsinghua adjusted the departments, 60% of the teachers were transferred out. Now the teachers have heavy teaching tasks, and the leadership should carefully plan for them to improve further."

Dogmatism is Still Very Serious

Dogmatism at Tsinghua University is very serious. Associate Professor He Chengjun said that during the first oral examination, some students reflected that many students in the class had to compete for five points and could not sleep for several nights. I talked to the League cadres about this issue and said that it should be resolved well. The League cadres said, "It is the same in the Soviet Union!" And then it was put aside. Some things are very sad. Once, I talked to the department secretary about problems in teaching work. I talked about what should be done, but the department secretary said that it could not be done according to my way, it would not work! Later, I found that he was arranging work according to my opinion. I asked, "Why is this?" He said that he had already asked the experts. Some Party members even said, "Don't listen to the words of non-Party members, listen to us Party members."

Formalistic Ideological Work

Many professors said that the school's ideological education work is somewhat formalistic. When everyone discusses political studies, they first look for a conclusion and then move towards the conclusion. However, this cannot solve the problem. People do not speak their true feelings, and the discussion of problems will not be thorough. Also, political studies are divided into Group A and Group B, and there is also a grading. I don't know what the purpose of separating the studies is. The Party has cultivated some activists, but some activists do not have a very good influence among the masses. How are these activists produced? It is worth studying. Professor Huang Wanli of the Water Conservancy Department said that the school's ideological and political education work seems boring and cannot integrate ideological education work into students' daily lives. We oppose both formulaic movies and boring ideological and political work. We hope that the school's ideological and political work can be like "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," so that it is full of poetry and poetic atmosphere.

Should Not Have the View of Being "Number One in the Country"

In Tsinghua University, some people have the view of being number one in the country. Professor He Zenglu said that, in fact, some things at Tsinghua University are not necessarily the best. We should learn from other schools well, and there is still much to learn. For example, the library work does not have a catalog now, and we don't know when the books are borrowed. Suggestions for improving the library work were put forward, but some leading comrades would not listen to them, thinking that everything at Tsinghua is good, so how could the library not be good! Wang Zunhua said that Tsinghua was slow to launch the "Hundred Schools of Thought Contend," and it was worse than other schools. I hope the leadership will check it. Now, the leadership seems to have nothing to do, and they are somewhat complacent. Some professors said, "What are the benefits of Tsinghua promoting advanced collectives?" Apart from other things, the process of selecting advanced collectives is the biggest bureaucracy because the leadership only relies on reports without going deep into the actual situation to understand it.

The professors also put forward valuable opinions on strengthening students' ideological and political work, the school's administrative leadership work, the school's Party committee system, and the issue of professors running the school.

Yesterday's forum at Tsinghua University was a good start. The professors still have many valuable opinions, which will continue to be provided in the future to help Tsinghua University's Party organization rectify its work style more deeply and improve a step further.

    清华园里百余教授开怀畅谈
    不该用搞运动的方法办教育
    本报讯　中共清华大学委员会昨天晚上，邀请全校一百多位教授、副教授举行了座谈。许多教授、副教授提供宝贵意见，帮助学校党组织进行整风。
    欢迎党的整风
    清华大学整风已经开始了。全校教授都表示欢迎，并愿意积极帮助党组织进行整风。何成钧副教授说，作为一个非党的知识分子，对于党的整风，一方面感到兴奋，一方面又怀着感激之情。我们知道，没有党的领导，什么也不会有，这是很清楚的事情。但是，我们的工作中也有缺点，如官僚主义、宗派主义、教条主义就是。党的整风，就是为了克服这些缺点，将使党更加坚强有力。党同知识分子的关系，是整风的重要课题。我希望党委对整风要求放高些，不要满足于已有的成就。
    用青年运动的方法搞教育
    习惯势力，有时使人思想僵化，一时扭转不过来。建筑系张守仪副教授说，学校领导方面，只会用搞运动和行政命令的方法解决问题。陈梁生副教授说，学校教育工作方法应该是和风细雨，不是狂风暴雨。例如修改教学计划，不是一个运动能解决了的，对某一个问题需要仔细的具体工作。
    李欧副教授这样说，什么习惯势力是清华的特点呢？用搞青年运动的方法来搞学校教育，这就成了清华的特点。这个特点有三多三少。三多三少是：搞运动多，细致工作少；任务贯彻多，商量少；关心青年多，关心中年以上的人少。学校搞运动，总是一波未平，一波又起。当然，有中心是要得的，但是不能把经常工作冲破了。所谓贯彻多，也就是指搞运动的手法，上面布置，下面贯彻，没有什么商量。学校考虑学生的问题是对的，而对教师的问题考虑得就太少了。
    电机系教授章名涛也说，清华目前学术空气还不够，这是否和党的领导作风有关系呢？过去党习惯于搞运动的作风，习惯于用这一套办法，现在值得考虑。
    连吃饭都不愿坐在一桌上
    党同群众之间是有一道墙的，应该拆墙。有的党员负责同志，脱离群众，走在路上，见到其他同志却不大理。这是为什么呢？万嘉璜副教授说，有的年青的党员，还为这个事情作解释。他说，“因为负责同志很忙，在走路时也思考问题，所以没有看到你！”这样，就只能造成隔阂。还有，在吃饭的时候，党员和非党员在一起，正是党员接近群众的好机会。可是，却不是这样。党员吃饭在一个桌子，非党员在一个桌子，好像连吃饭都有阶级性似的，影响很不好。自然，也有些党员同志很好，碰见面能好好谈谈。张坚教授说，党对非党群众关心少，商量少，只要求工作。
    李鹤云教授说，有的党员同志眼睛望空中看，有时甚至在楼梯上碰面也不打招呼。过去是师生关系，但今天也冷淡了。是否入了党就比别人高了一级？有的本来是我的学生，现在也不理我了，真是六亲不认了。有些后起的党员比老的架子还大。机械制造系教授金希武说：我觉得学校新老教师之间的关系还不够亲密，不够诚恳，不够尊重。有些年轻教师对老教师还存在着敬而远之的情况。同时因为学校对教师们照顾的情况不一样，也影响了教师之间的团结。有些教师一入党后，路上碰见也不再点头了。
    水利系陈梁生教授说，没有看见过党员在公开场合大胆的批评与自我批评。有些党员只谈原则，但不愿做具体工作，我们系里就有这样的党员。建筑系莫宗江副教授说，有人对党员或对某草案提出意见时，党员不是听别人说，而是向别人解释一番，后来大家就不提意见了。党员和非党群众日常生活中不在一起谈心，只有在讨论问题才在一起，都是很严肃。我们系的党员，不是在群众之上，也不是在群众之中，而是在群众一边。建筑系辜传诲教授说，学校对非党的领导干部关心和照顾不够，有些处于三不管的状态。参加社会政治活动，过去还注意了一下，也像昙花一现过去了。马约翰老教授和陶葆楷教授都认为党和非党同志都要主动接蚀，对团结才更有帮助。许多教授都提出了改进党群关系的意见。
    党外干部有职无权
    水利系黄万里教授说，有职无权，是个普遍现象，像不成文法一样，大家习惯了，也不感觉什么，更不是什么新奇的事情。张任教授说，有职无权可以这样来比喻，参加施工的多，参加设计的少。例如送到国外去深造的名单，不是由教研室主任签名推荐的，而是由上面提出来的，不能说上面没有调查研究，但总不如教研室主任知道的详细具体。这些名单提出来以后，也没有很好讨论，教研室成员提级问题也是如此。充分发挥各教研室成员的积极性，需要使系主任和教研室主任有职有权，不仅让他们参加施工，而且也要他们多多参加设计。
    李辑祥教授说：我觉得清华党群关系虽然不像铜墙铁壁，但问题还是有。例如在有职有权这点上就还做得不够，党有的事管得太多了。如教研组是个教学工作单位，但是工作权限就不够。
    董树屏说，我认为清华的党和行政之间的工作关系还没配合得好，还有一定的距离，有些事情只通过党委，没有通过行政，缺乏研究，缺乏讨论。
    多商量、多信任、多帮助
    动力机械系副教授方崇智说：我认为党对高级知识分子主要应多和他们商量并信任他们。目前清华党群关系一般还融洽，但党对教授们多少还有点看成外人。我举几个小例子来说，例如有外宾来清华参观时，学校限制教授们不许用外文直接和外宾交谈。又如教授们给苏联专家送些礼物时，也一定要经过系秘书，这实际上使教授和苏联专家不能够更亲密一些。例如高等教育部曾再三声明，限制教授们不能直接和外国直接联系，这也值得考虑。
    机械制造系教授王遵明说：在百家争鸣的今天我觉得清华大学领导上虽然辛辛苦苦，但对某些方面开展还很不够。如在提高教学质量方面，首先学校领导上对青年教师和老教师业务水平的提高就都重视得很不够。清华在院系调整的时候，有60％的教师被抽调出去了，现在教师们的教学任务很重，领导上应该替教师们很好地打算，使他们再提高一步。
    教条主义还很严重
    清华大学的教条主义是很严重的。何成钧副教授说，在第一次口试的时候，有的同学反映，班上许多同学要争五分，几个晚上睡不着觉。我就同团的干部谈这个问题，应当很好解决。团的干部却说，“苏联也是的”！这就搁下来了。有的事是很令人伤心的事。有一次，我同系里的秘书谈教学工作中的问题。我讲了应该怎么办，可是系秘书说，不能照你的办，不行！后来，我发现他又按照我的意见布置工作。我问，为什么这样？他说，已经问过专家了。有的党员甚至说，你们不要听党外人话，听我们党员的。
    形式主义的思想工作
    许多教授都说，学校的思想教育工作，有些形式主义。大家在政治学习讨论时，先找结论，然后向结论迈进。但是，这样不能解决问题，人不说真心话，问题讨论得也就会不彻底。还有，政治学习也分甲组、乙组，也分了个等级，不知道分开学的目的是什么。党培养了一些积极分子，可是，有的积极分子在群众中的影响却不太好。这种积极分子是怎样产生的？值得研究。水利系黄万里教授说，学校思想政治教育工作，显得枯燥无味，不能把思想教育工作融化在学生日常生活中去。我们既反对公式化的电影，也反对枯燥无味的思想政治工作。我们希望学校的思想政治工作能像“百花齐放、百家争鸣”，这样富有诗意，富有诗境才好。
    不该有“全国第一”的看法
    清华大学中，有些人有全国第一的看法。何增录教授说，其实，清华大学有些也不一定第一。我们应该好好去学学别的学校，要学的还很多。比如图书馆工作，现在就没有分类目，书借出去也不晓得。提出了改进图书馆工作的建议，有的领导同志也听不进去，认为清华什么都好，图书馆还能不好吗！王遵华说，清华开展“百家争鸣”慢了，搞得比别的学校又差，希望领导方面检查一下。现在，领导方面好像没有什么，有些自满。有的教授说，清华大学推行先进集体，有什么好处呢？别的且不说，先进集体评选的经过，就是最大的官僚主义，因为领导方面只靠汇报，而没有深入实际了解情况。
    教授们对加强学生思想政治工作、学校行政领导工作，以及学校党委制和教授治校问题，等等，也都提了很宝贵的意见。
    清华大学昨天的座谈会，是一个良好的开始。教授们还有许多宝贵的意见，将在以后继续提供出来，帮助清华大学党组织的整风更深入一步，提高一步。
