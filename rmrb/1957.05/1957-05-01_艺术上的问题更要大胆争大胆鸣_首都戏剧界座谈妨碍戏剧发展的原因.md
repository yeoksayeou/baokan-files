Artistic Issues Require Bolder Debate and Expression
Beijing Drama Circle Discusses Reasons Hindering Theatrical Development

(Our dispatch) The Beijing drama community has begun to discuss "how to correctly handle contradictions among the people." The first symposium organized by the Chinese Dramatists Association was held on April 29, and was presided over by Mei Lanfang.

New Plays Most Afraid of Indifference

Wu Xue spoke at the meeting, appealing against the cold reception given to newly created plays. He said: In words, everyone says they want to support and value newly created plays, but in reality, the growth of this tender flower encounters great resistance and many difficulties. He said that the China Youth Art Theater recently rehearsed "The Flute Plays Horizontally," and invited people from the literary and art circles. It so happened that on that day, a famous Peking opera actor took the daughter of a film actor as an apprentice, which was very lively there, and many seats in the theater were empty. Wu Xue said: The most terrible thing is indifference. When a play written by an unknown new writer is staged, critics, newspapers, and periodicals remain silent.

Newspapers and Periodicals Have Authority Worship

Ouyang Shanzun agreed with Wu Xue's opinion. He criticized the editors of newspapers and periodicals for having authority worship. In fact, audiences often have very valuable and fresh opinions. They write their impressions and criticisms in letters and send them to the editorial department, but they are never published. The editorial department wants to invite experts to write conclusive articles. Even the People's Daily is like this.

Ouyang Shanzun believes that studying Stanislavsky and studying excellent national traditions are not contradictory. The two should have exchanges and can be combined. This is beneficial to the development of spoken drama. Some people oppose the two, which is a metaphysical point of view. He hopes that the spoken drama community will start a debate on this issue.

Jiao Juyin said: As a director, I feel that there are many contradictions in how writers and directors cooperate. I hope to find ways to resolve these contradictions by studying Chairman Mao's report.

Play Scripts Pay Too Little

Feng Zi raised the issue of professional playwrights. She said: Now the royalty for a new script is only 600 yuan, and the performance tax is also 600 yuan, for a total of only 1,200 yuan. However, it takes playwrights two years from conception to writing a new script; how can this 1,200 yuan sustain a person with burdens for two years? Therefore, even if some people have the material, they first consider writing novels or film scripts (a film script has a royalty of 3,000 yuan) and only think of writing scripts later. She believes that this is one of the important reasons why there are not many new creations currently.

Xia Chun talked about the contradictions between playwrights and directors regarding revisions of scripts. If both sides adopt a cooperative attitude, this problem can still be resolved well. He cited some examples of good cooperation in the Beijing People's Art Theater.

Who Exactly is in Charge?

Chen Baichen asked: Who exactly is in specific charge of the spoken drama movement? Is it the Ministry of Culture, or the Chinese Dramatists Association? It seems that both are in charge, but which one is the main one? I think the general contradiction in the spoken drama circle lies here. He also said: Now the number of copies of publications has increased several times to ten times compared with the past, but only scripts are printed less than in the past; why can scripts only be printed in 3,000 or 5,000 copies? When he talked about the relationship between playwrights and theaters, he believed that theaters should include playwrights; now it always feels that playwrights are standing outside the theater, not part of the family. In the past, many scripts were created by playwrights, directors, and actors together. Why not continue this decades of experience?

Actor Dai Ya said at the meeting: "There are also contradictions between us actors. For example, there are contradictions between experienced actors and young actors." He especially felt that the training of young actors and the improvement of old actors are both issues that deserve attention.

Li Hanhui and Zhang Ying both pointed out that the air of free discussion is lacking in theatrical criticism. Li Hanhui also believes that how spoken drama can win the love of the broad audience is still a serious problem.

Why Can't It Be "Released"?

Qiu Shengrong and Li Hezeng expressed their opinions on the excavation of traditional repertoire. Qiu Shengrong said that the lineup of current folk professional troupes is weak, and they cannot "release" more and better traditional repertoire; although the lineup of state-owned troupes is strong, because the system is inflexible and actors pick plays, famous actors cannot cooperate on the same stage, and they cannot "release" more and better traditional repertoire either. He proposed making necessary adjustments to the actor lineup.

The Ministry of Culture is Too Unfair

The opera circles everywhere are calling for "no successors" and "to cultivate the second generation." In recent years, Li Guiyun has run two training classes in her own New China Hebei Bangzi Troupe, training eighty students who are all able to perform on stage. Li Guiyun said at the meeting: "However, the government's help to us is not enough. Our training class has no house. The children practice their skills, but they can't straighten their guns; they somersault on the bed; they walk in aisles that can't be turned around. Sometimes we borrow the courtyards of the people to practice. In recent years, we have performed for workers, for farmers, and for the People's Liberation Army, but we have no place in Beijing and run around all year round. When we tour, we often live in very damp places, and even lived in pigsties. Not only is the government's help insufficient, but recently, I heard that they want to send our troupe out of Beijing!" Speaking of this, she burst into tears. She said: "Beijing Bangzi has a history of more than 200 years in Beijing. Some cadres in the government don't like it, but the masses like it. We won't leave! We will grit our teeth and stay in Beijing!"

Ma Shaobo then spoke, saying that he heard that some comrades in the Ministry of Culture wanted to send Hebei Bangzi out of Beijing. He said that this is sectarianism, and it is too unfair to such an ancient opera. Talking about "letting a hundred flowers bloom" and liberating ideological shackles, he said that the current problem is still the need for leadership support. The leadership should not have fixed views. On artistic issues, there should be bolder debate and bolder expression. For example, serial plays, such as Peking opera using scenery, must first be allowed to exist, and then we can argue whether it is good or bad, whether it is needed or not.

### 艺术上的问题更要大胆争大胆鸣  首都戏剧界座谈妨碍戏剧发展的原因

    艺术上的问题更要大胆争大胆鸣
    首都戏剧界座谈妨碍戏剧发展的原因
    本报讯  首都戏剧界人士开始讨论“如何正确处理人民内部矛盾问题”。中国戏剧家协会召开的第一次座谈会在4月29日举行，由梅兰芳主持。
    新剧目最怕遭受冷淡
    吴雪在会上为话剧的新创作剧目受到冷淡而呼吁。他说：口头上，大家都在说要扶持和重视新创作剧目，实际上，这朵幼嫩花朵的成长，遇到很大的阻力，困难很多。他说，中国青年艺术剧院最近彩排“洞箫横吹”，招待文艺界，恰好那天有一位著名京剧演员收一位电影演员的女儿做徒弟，那里很热闹，剧场里可空了不少座位。吴雪说：最可怕的是冷淡。一个无名的新作家写的剧目上演，批评家、报纸、刊物都不说话。
    报刊有崇拜权威思想
    欧阳山尊同意吴雪的意见。他批评报纸、刊物的编辑有权威崇拜思想。其实，观众中间常常有很宝贵、新鲜的意见，他们写了观感、批评、来信，送到编辑部，从来得不到发表。编辑部要请专家写结论性的文章。连人民日报也是如此。
    欧阳山尊认为，学习斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基和学习优秀的民族传统，并不矛盾，两者应有交流，可以结合。这对于话剧的发展有好处。有人把两者对立起来，是形而上学的观点。他希望话剧界就这个问题展开争鸣。
    焦菊隐说：作为导演，我感到作家和导演如何合作，存在着很多矛盾。希望在学习毛主席的报告中，找到解决矛盾的途径。
    剧本的稿费太低
    凤子提出了目前剧作家职业化中的问题。她说：现在一个新剧本的稿费只六百元，上演税也是六百元，一共才一千二百元。可是，剧作家从酝酿到写出一个新剧本，前后得两年；这一千二百元怎么能够维持一个有负担的人两年的生活费？所以，有的人虽然有了材料，就先考虑写小说，或是电影剧本（一个电影剧本有三千元稿费），最后才想到写剧本。她认为这是目前新创作不多的重要原因之一。
    夏淳谈到剧作家和导演之间对于剧本的修改也存在着矛盾，如果双方面采取合作的态度，这个问题还是能够很好解决的。他举出了北京人民艺术剧院一些合作得很好的例子。
    究竟谁在领导
    陈白尘问：话剧运动到底是谁在具体领导？是文化部，还是中国戏剧家协会？好像二者都在领导，但是以谁为主呢？我看，话剧界的总的矛盾就在这里。他又说：现在出版物的印数都比过去增加几倍到十倍，唯有剧本反而比过去印得少了；为什么剧本就只能印三千或五千呢？他讲到剧作家和剧院的关系时，认为剧院应包括剧作家；现在总觉得剧作家是站在剧院外边，不是一家。过去，许多剧本都是剧作家和导演、演员一起来搞的，这个几十年的经验为什么不继续下去呢？
    演员戴涯在会上说：“我们演员之间也有矛盾。譬如有经验的演员和青年演员就有矛盾。”他特别觉得青年演员的培养和老演员的提高，都是目前值得重视的问题。
    李汉辉和张颖都提出了戏剧批评缺乏自由讨论的空气。李汉辉并认为话剧如何争取广大观众的喜爱，仍是个严重的问题。
    为什么“放”不出来
    裘盛戎和李和曾就发掘传统剧目发表了意见。裘盛戎说，目前民间职业剧团的阵容薄弱，“放”不出更多更好的传统剧目；国营剧团阵容虽然强大，因为制度不灵活，演员挑戏，使得著名演员不能同台合作，也“放”不出更多更好的传统剧目。他提议对于演员阵容作必要的调整。
    文化部太不公平
    戏曲界到处在叫“后继无人”，“要培养第二代”。这几年，李桂云在自己领导的新中华河北梆子剧团里办了两期学习班，培养了八十来个学生，都已能登台演出。李桂云在会上说：“可是，政府对我们的帮助很不够。我们的学习班，没有房子。孩子练功，枪也举不直；翻跟斗，在床上；走脚步，在转不开身的过道里。有时借老百姓的院子练功。这几年，我们为工人演出，为农民演出，为解放军演出，可是在北京我们却没有地盘，终年在外跑。在外巡回演出，我们常住在很潮湿的地方，还住过猪圈。政府帮助不够不说，最近，又听说要把我们剧团送出北京去！”谈到这里她声泪俱下。她说：“京梆子，在北京有二百多年历史了。政府里有些干部不喜欢，群众可喜欢它。我们不走！咬紧牙关我们也要在北京呆下来！”
    马少波接着发言，他听说，文化部就有同志要把河北梆子送出京去。他说，这是宗派主义思想，对于这样一个古老的剧种，这是太不公平了。谈到“百花齐放”，解放思想束缚，他说，目前的问题还是要领导上支持。领导上不要有固定的看法。艺术上的问题，更应大胆争，大胆鸣。比如连台本戏，比如京剧用布景，先要允许存在，然后再来争好不好，要不要。
