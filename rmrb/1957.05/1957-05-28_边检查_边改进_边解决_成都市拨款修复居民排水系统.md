Xinhua News Agency Special Dispatch: In the past half-month, the Chengdu Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has invited people from all walks of life outside the Party to hold many symposiums to solicit their opinions on Party organizations. The symposiums are not yet over. For some problems that need to be solved immediately and can be solved, the relevant units have begun to solve them. For example, many people at the meeting criticized some basic construction departments for disrupting the drainage systems of nearby residents due to the construction of roads and houses without repairing them, affecting their environmental sanitation; some places have difficulty accessing drinking water, which has not been resolved for a long time. Around May 20, the Chengdu Municipal Urban Construction Committee allocated more than 6,000 yuan and a batch of building materials to help residents in these areas repair drainage systems and install tap water pipes. At present, the drainage project in the Labor People's New Village near Qingyang Palace in the suburbs and the tap water pipe installation project in Ximen Beixiangzi in the city have started construction, and drainage projects in other places will also start construction soon.

Some folk art performers have pointed out that they had no fixed performance venues in the past, and they were often rejected and squeezed out when performing in teahouses and other public places, which affected their lives. After hearing about this situation, Mayor Li Zonglin immediately instructed relevant departments to hold a meeting with representatives of the artists to study and solve the problem.

In terms of cooperation, several non-Party vice mayors of Chengdu have pointed out that they knew very little about the work of the various departments of the Municipal People's Committee in the past, making it difficult to get involved in the work. Now, the Municipal People's Committee has improved the system of collective office work for the mayor and vice mayors every Tuesday, and the units under its jurisdiction take turns reporting on the situation. Some engineering and technical personnel in factories and mines have requested that a workers' representative conference be held in factories and mines. The Industrial Department of the Chengdu Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently made a decision requiring large factories and mines to convene a workers' representative conference before the end of June.

    边检查　边改进　边解决
    成都市拨款修复居民排水系统
    本报特约新华社稿　半月来，中共成都市委曾邀请党外各界举行多次座谈，征求他们对党组织的意见。座谈还没有结束。对于一些需要马上解决而又可能解决的问题，各有关单位已着手解决。例如，会上不少人批评某些基本建设部门由于修筑道路和房屋，打乱了附近居民的排水系统而不给修复，影响他们的环境卫生；有些地方的居民吃水发生困难，也长期不给解决。成都市城市建设委员会于5月20日前后，即拨款六千多元和一批建筑材料，帮助这些地方的居民修复排水系统和安装自来水管。现在，市郊青羊宫附近劳动人民新村的排水工程，和市区西门北巷子的自来水管安装工程已经动工，其它地方的排水工程不久也可开工。
    有的民间曲艺艺人提出：他们过去无固定演出场所，到茶馆等公共场所演出，又往往遭到拒绝和排挤，影响了他们的生活。市长李宗林听到这一情况后，即指示有关部门，会同艺人代表开会研究解决。
    在合作共事方面，成都市几位非党员副市长提出：过去他们了解市人民委员会各部门的工作情况很少，难于插手工作。现在，市人民委员会已健全了市长、副市长每星期二集体办公的制度，并由所属各单位轮流汇报情况。有些厂矿的工程技术人员提出：要求召开厂矿的职工代表大会，中共成都市委工业部在最近即作出决定，要求大型厂矿在6月下旬前召开一次职工代表大会。
