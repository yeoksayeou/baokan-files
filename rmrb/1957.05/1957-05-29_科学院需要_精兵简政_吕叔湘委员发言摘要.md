Scientific workers have had a common feeling these past few years: not enough time. Where has the time gone? Social activities take up a portion. But this factor only affects some of us. Even those locked inside the institute don't necessarily get to do proper research work. They are busy, but not accomplishing anything significant. They are constantly circling around research work, but don't have enough time to dedicate to the research itself. Why? Before work begins, there's a set of procedures: planning, deployment, promotion. Shortly after work has begun, there's another set: inspection, summary, reporting. Then it's back to re-planning, re-deployment, and so on. Summaries include annual summaries, semi-annual summaries, and in the past, even quarterly summaries. As for reporting, not long ago, the Academic Secretariat required monthly reports, the Academic Divisions required semi-monthly reports, and sometimes even major reports to the Standing Committee of the Academy. Inspections, in addition to those preparing for summaries, also combine with work inspections for every important study or movement. It's not that these things are unnecessary, but the methods need consideration. Planning is needed, but is it necessary to fill out so many cumbersome forms? Inspection and reporting are also needed, but do they need to be so frequent? As for whether anyone seriously looks at those reports and whether the problems found during inspections and summaries are solved, that's another question entirely. Because these tasks are carried out in a formalistic way, it leads to numerous meetings, numerous forms to fill out, numerous documents to write, and excessive red tape, which takes up a lot of time that should be used for research work, and disrupts the stable progress necessary for research work. Formalism is also manifested in theoretical study and engaging in movements.

I feel that in recent years, there has been a popular approach to promoting work. This approach can be summed up in one word: "add": add people, add institutions, add regulations, which means add more frills. What I mentioned above belongs to the category of adding regulations. Now let me talk about personnel and institutions.

There's an old saying: "Many hands make light work." This saying is both right and wrong. It depends on what kind of people and what kind of work. There are all kinds of different people and all kinds of different work. People who don't solve problems still won't solve them even if there are more of them (only adding trouble to the administration, making the dormitory problems, transportation problems, medical problems, etc., even more serious). The number of staff at the Academy of Sciences has reached or is approaching 14,000. Among them, researchers and associate researchers number about 700, accounting for only 5% of the total. The number of mid-level researchers is about the same as senior researchers, also about 700. Add to this the approximately 1,000 technical and translation personnel. These three items are the main strength of the Academy, totaling only 2,400 people, accounting for 17% of the total. Assistant staff and administrative personnel total about 8,500 people, exceeding 60% of the total. This ratio is very unreasonable. Saying that the Academy of Sciences has a large number of people is not precise enough. It should be said that on the one hand there are too many, and on the other hand there are still too few. Speaking of the quality of cadres, there are also many problems. The use of cadres mainly requires matching people to positions. Everyone has their use, but not everyone can do any job. Mismatching people to positions ruins the work and also wastes the people. The Academy of Sciences' cadre policy seems to focus on senior personnel while relaxing on general personnel, focusing on research personnel while relaxing on others. Interns are waiting for assignments. The recruitment of general assistant staff and administrative personnel does not seem to have a specific system. The situation of mismatching people to positions is naturally unavoidable.

Speaking of institutions, quite a few research units have been added in the past year. I don't know if the conditions are all mature. Taking the Academy headquarters as an example, the institutions are becoming more and more massive and complex. In addition to the Academy headquarters, there are the Academic Divisions. We who work in the institutes often don't know which department to look for when something comes up, or which responsible comrade to find. Complex institutions, many links, inevitably slow down work, and coupled with the fact that some comrades are not very responsible, it is easier to make mistakes. There are also cases of mutual buck-passing. Sometimes adding a new institution also brings some "new ideas." For example, when the Cadre Training Department was newly established (at that time it had not yet become a bureau), it issued document No. 1 of the Training Department to all institutes, requiring them to fill out detailed resumes of all cadres. In fact, the Cadre Bureau had a full set of them stored there, and it was effortless for the Cadre Training Department to refer to them. To be honest, I still don't know what the mission of the Cadre Training Bureau is. If it's just receiving and sending documents and forms, one secretary and two assistants would be enough.

In short, the Academy of Sciences has a large institution, many personnel, and many tricks, but low efficiency. This is not just my feeling. Since the "addition" method of the past few years has not been very effective, can we try the "subtraction" method now? Reducing some institutions, reducing some personnel, and reducing some regulations might make the work better, it's hard to say. Of course, it's not to say absolutely no additions; for the needs of the work, what should be added should still be added. But what should be reduced must also be reduced.

This Academic Division meeting will discuss the system of the Academy of Sciences. Can we think about it from the perspective of "streamlining administration," to achieve (1) flexible institutions, (2) matching people to positions, (3) clarifying responsibilities, and (4) reducing red tape. If we can act according to these principles, I believe the efficiency of the Academy of Sciences can be greatly improved.

### 科学院需要“精兵简政”  吕叔湘委员发言摘要

    科学院需要“精兵简政”
    吕叔湘委员发言摘要
    这几年来，科学工作者中间有一个普遍的感觉：时间不够用。时间哪里去了？社会活动占用了一部分。可是这个因素只影响我们中间的部分人，但即使关在研究所大门之内的人，也并不见得能好好的做研究工作。很忙，但是忙不出一个名堂。老是在围绕研究工作打转，可没有足够的时间用在研究工作本身上。为什么呢？工作开始之前有一套：计划，布置，推动。工作了不久之后又有一套：检查，总结，汇报。接着又要重计划，重布置，如是周而复始。总结有年度总结，半年总结，过去还有季度总结。汇报，在不久之前，学术秘书处要每月汇报，学部要半月汇报，有时候还要到院务常委会议去做大汇报。检查，除了为总结作准备的检查外，每来一个重要的学习或是运动，也都要结合着检查工作。不是说这些事情不需要，而是说方式要考虑。需要有计划，但是不是要填写那么多烦琐的表格呢？检查和汇报也都有需要，但是不是要那么频繁呢？至于那些表报是否有人认真看，检查和总结出来的问题是否设法解决，那就又是另一问题。就因为形式主义地进行这些工作，就形成了开会多，填表多，写文件多，繁文缛节占去了不少应该用在研究工作上的时间，并且打乱了研究工作所必需的稳定的进程。形式主义也表现在理论学习和搞运动上。
    我感觉这几年来，对于如何推进工作，流行着一套办法。这套办法总起来是一个字，“加”：加人，加机构，加条文也就是加花样。上面所说属于加条文的一类，现在再说说人员和机构。
    老话说，“人多好办事”，这句话也对也不对。要看什么样的人，什么样的事。有各种不同的人，有各种不同的事。不解决问题的人，多几个还是不解决问题（徒然给管理局添麻烦，使宿舍问题、交通问题、医药问题等更加严重起来）。现在科学院的工作人员已经到达或者接近一万四千人。其中研究员和副研究员大约七百人，只占总人数的5％，中级研究人员的数目大约和高级研究人员相等，也约七百人。再加上技术人员和编译人员大约一千人。这三项是科学院的主要力量，加起来也只二千四百人，占总人数的17％。助理业务人员和行政人员合起来大约八千五百人，超过总人数的60％。这样的比例数是很不合理的。上面说科学院人数多，还不够精密。应该说一方面是太多，一方面还是太少。再讲到干部的质量，问题也多。使用干部，主要是要人地相宜。每个人都有他的用处，可是并不是任何人可以做任何工作。人地不相宜，毁了工作也糟塌了人。科学院的干部政策好像是抓紧高级而放松一般，抓紧研究人员而放松其他。实习员是听候分配。一般助理业务人员和行政人员的进用似乎也没有一定的制度。人地不相宜的情形自然就难免了。
    说到机构，最近一年里增加了好些个研究单位，是否条件都很成熟，我不了解情况。单拿院部来说，机构是越来越庞大而复杂了。院部之外还有学部。我们在所里工作的人，常常有事情不知道找哪个部门，找哪位负责同志。机构复杂，环节多，办事必然迟缓，再加上有些同志做事不大负责任，就更容易出错。互相推诿踢皮球的情形也不是没有。有时候增加一个新的机构也会带来一些“新猷”，例如干部培养部新成立的时候（那个时候还没有成为局），就用培字第一号行文各所，要填报所有干部的详细履历，其实干部局就有全份保存在那儿，干部培养部要参考是毫不费事的。说实话，我到现在还不知道干部培养局的任务是什么。如果只是收发一些文书表格，有一位秘书和两位助手也尽够了。
    总之，科学院机构庞大，人员多，花样多，可是效率不高。这也不是我一个人的感觉。既然过去几年的“加”的办法没有多大成效，现在是不是也可以试试“减”的办法。减少一些机构，减少一些人员，减少一些条文，或许能把工作做得更好些，也未可知。当然不是说绝对不要增加，为了工作的需要，该加的还是要加。但是该减的也一定要减。
    这次学部会议上要讨论科学院的体制问题，是不是可以从“精兵简政”这方面着想，做到（1）机构灵活，（2）人地相宜，（3）明确责任，（4）减少繁文缛节。要是能根据这几条原则办事，我相信科学院工作效率是能大大提高的。
