Xinhua News Agency, May 21st: The rainy season has already begun in the south, and the rainy season in the north is also imminent. The Ministry of Water Resources issued a notice on the 20th, requiring all localities to seize the opportunity to strengthen flood prevention and drainage work during the rainy season.

The notice stated that in 1956, the Hai River Basin, the Huai River Basin, and parts of Northeast China suffered relatively severe floods and waterlogging disasters. About 70% of the affected areas were due to waterlogging, which has made us further realize the importance of flood prevention and drainage work, and many areas have strengthened their work in this regard. According to statistics from Henan, Hebei, Shandong, Anhui, Jiangsu, and other provinces, the area benefited from flood prevention and drainage projects (including ditches, furrows, and raised fields) completed from October last year to April this year reached 15 million mu, and some areas have formed mass movements for waterlogging control. However, there are still some areas that do not pay enough attention to waterlogging control work and have relaxed some of the work that can be carried out currently. To this end, the notice requires all localities to:

First, seize the opportunity to actively carry out the necessary flood prevention and drainage projects. For some key dikes, culverts, and drainage channels, it is necessary to assign special personnel to be responsible for completing them within a time limit. The effective experience of the masses in waterlogging prevention and control, such as ditches, furrows, raised fields, and large raised fields, should be vigorously promoted according to local conditions. At the same time, special attention should be paid to the inspection and acceptance of completed projects, strictly paying attention to quality. Substandard projects should be repaired or reinforced in a timely manner.

Second, flood prevention and drainage projects are diverse and scattered, and it is necessary to mobilize and rely on the masses for management and maintenance. After the completion of the projects, grassroots management and maintenance organizations should be established immediately, with responsibilities divided by sections and areas. For larger projects involving two counties, two special districts, or two provinces, unified management and maintenance organizations should be established locally through consultation to achieve unified management, mutual supervision, and joint responsibility. Ditches, furrows, raised fields, and smaller embankments, weirs, and culvert projects can be assigned to agricultural cooperatives for maintenance, with cooperatives assigning special personnel to be responsible and providing work point recording.

Third, in the case of insufficient existing equipment for flood prevention and drainage capacity, we must be highly vigilant against the event of exceptionally heavy rain and formulate sound handling methods in advance to make thorough arrangements, striving to reduce possible disaster losses. Sufficient preparations and plans should be made in advance for issues such as the pumping machinery and equipment required for drainage, the relocation and resettlement of residents near temporary flood storage areas and flood discharge channels.

Fourth, for drainage disputes that have occurred or may occur between upstream and downstream areas, we should adhere to the principles of combining storage and discharge, considering both upstream and downstream areas, subordinating partial interests to overall interests, and taking care of local interests within the overall context. Both parties should actively and promptly consult and properly handle disputes. In our work, we must always pay attention to overcoming regionalism. Generally, it is best for leading cadres to personally come forward, cooperate with representatives from relevant parties, and reach agreements through on-site democratic consultation. After being approved by the leadership, the agreements should be resolutely implemented. In particular, disputes that occurred last year but have not yet been resolved should be addressed promptly to avoid prolonged delays and the recurrence of preventable disaster losses.

    水利部要求各地防涝排水
    去年受水灾的面积有70％左右是属于内涝性质的。
    对于防涝排水不可再忽视了！
    据新华社21日讯　目前南方已经开始进入雨季，北方离雨季的时间也很短暂。水利部在20日发出通知，要求各地抓紧时机，加强雨季的防涝排水工作。
    通知说，1956年海河流域、淮河流域和东北部分地区都遭受了比较严重的洪涝灾害。在受灾面积中有70％左右是属于内涝性质的，这就使得我们进一步认识到防涝排水工作的重要性，很多地区加强了这方面的工作。根据河南、河北、山东、安徽、江苏等省的统计，从去年10月到今年4月所完成的防涝排水工程（包括沟洫畦田）受益面积达一千五百万亩，有些地区已经形成了群众性的治涝运动。但是目前也还有些地区，对治涝工作重视不够，放松了当前可能进行的一些工作。为此，通知要求各地：
    一、抓紧时机，积极进行必要的防涝排水工程的修建，对于一些关键性的堤防、涵闸和排水渠道等工程必须指定专人负责限期完成，对群众中行之有效的治涝防涝经验，如沟洫畦田、大地畦田等应该因地制宜地大力推广。同时要特别注意对已完工程的检查验收工作，严格注意质量，不合标准的要及时加以修补或加固。
    二、防涝排水工程种类繁多，工程分散，必须发动和依靠群众进行管理养护。工程结束后，应立即建立基层管养组织，分段分片负责，较大工程关系两个县、两个专区、两个省的则应该就地协商成立统一的管养组织，作到统一管理，互相监督，共同负责。沟洫畦田和较小的圩、埝、涵闸工程可分段分片划归农业社养护，由社指定专人分工负责，并给以评工记分。
    三、在现有设备防涝排水能力不足的情况下，对于万一发生的特大雨水，必须提高警惕，事先研究出妥善的处理办法进行周密安排，力求减免可能造成的灾害损失。对于排水所需要的抽水机器设备，临时滞洪区和排洪河道附近居民的搬迁安置等问题，事先都应当有充分的准备和计划。
    四、对于上下游已经发生的和可能发生的排水纠纷，应该本着蓄泄兼施，上下兼顾，局部服从整体，整体照顾局部的原则，由双方主动、及早协商，妥善处理。在工作中必须经常注意克服地区本位思想，一般最好能由领导干部亲自出马，协同有关方面代表，就地民主协商达成协议，报经领导批准后，坚决贯彻执行。特别是去年已经发生而目前尚未解决的纠纷，尤其应该抓紧处理，以免久悬不决，再度造成本来可以避免的灾害损失。
