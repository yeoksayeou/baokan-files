    Boy's Clothing That Can Be Enlarged
    Britain has recently invented a type of boy's clothing that can be adjusted for two years as the children grow normally. The advantage of this clothing is that it does not require delicate sewing work; all that is needed is to remove the threads, lengthen it to the required new length, and iron it flat. The clothing is made with the cuffs, trouser hems, and trouser legs folded inside, and it also has a double-layered back crotch, a piece of patching cloth, and an extra set of buttons. This way, mothers no longer have to worry about constantly making new boy's clothing.

    可以放大的男童装
    英国最近发明了一种可以放大的男童装，这种服装在孩子们正常发育的情况下两年内都可适用。这种服装的好处是不需要作精巧的缝纫工作，它所需要的只是拆线和按所需要的新的长度放长和熨平。衣服的制作办法是将袖口、裤边和裤脚折在里边，同时还备有一个双层后裆，一块修补用的布和一副额外的纽扣。这样母亲们就可不再为经常添制男童装而操心了。
