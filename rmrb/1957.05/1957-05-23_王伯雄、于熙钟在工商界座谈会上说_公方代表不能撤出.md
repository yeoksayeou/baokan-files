Wang Boxiong and Yu Xizhong Say at Symposium with Business and Industrial Circles:
	Public Representatives Cannot Withdraw

(Our Newspaper) This newspaper reports that the national symposium with business and industrial circles hosted by the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee continued with its seventh session yesterday (the 22nd). There will be a recess today, and the meeting will continue tomorrow.

	Wang Boxiong said: If there are no public representatives, who will resolve the contradictions between employees and private owners, and between private owners themselves?

		Party member Deputy Secretaries-General play an important role in the Federation of Industry and Commerce and cannot be dispensed with.
	Wang Boxiong, representative of the China Democratic National Construction Association of Guangdong and Director of the Guangdong Industrial and Commercial Transformation Guidance Office, spoke on two issues at the symposium: first, whether public-private joint ventures should have public representatives; and second, whether the Federation of Industry and Commerce should have a Party member Deputy Secretary-General. He said: Some people believe that if there are public representatives in public-private joint ventures, there will be a "public-private relationship" that affects the development of the enterprise. I think this view is not comprehensive. I ask these people to face the following facts: From the perspective of enterprise development, with the leadership of the public side, the production of joint ventures in Guangzhou has increased by more than 30%; from the perspective of public-private relations, the relationship is getting better and better, with only a few exceptions; from the perspective of the enthusiasm of the private side, many people have been praised in socialist competitions. This situation illustrates the necessity of the public representative system.
	What difficulties would arise if there were no public representatives? I think there would be great difficulties. First, the contradictions between employees and private owners would not be resolved. Private owners today are still members of the bourgeoisie, and their thinking is not without distance from the working class. Second, there are many disputes between private entities in merged enterprises, with no one willing to submit to anyone else. They are constantly scheming against each other, excluding and attacking each other. One factory argued for a month over the name of the factory, unable to reach an agreement, and was later resolved with the help of the public representative. Therefore, the existence of the public representative system in joint ventures is of great benefit to implementing national production plans and policies and guiding employees to improve relations between private entities. Abolishing public representatives does more harm than good.
	Why do some private personnel have dissatisfaction with public representatives? He believes that some public representatives do not adequately assess the progressiveness of the private side and ignore their opinions, while the private personnel also have shortcomings. In the past, private enterprises were long dominated by "me," acting arbitrarily; after joint ventures, they are not accustomed to collective leadership, and even dissatisfied; secondly, they are accustomed to a free and undisciplined life and find it inconvenient to establish rules; thirdly, they look down on public representatives, thinking that they do not understand technology. He believes that although both the public and private sides have shortcomings, the public side should bear the main responsibility for resolving this contradiction.
	When talking about the correct treatment of public-private relations, he said that the overall situation is good. One cannot abolish the public representative system because some public representatives have shortcomings, just as one cannot ask the private side to leave the enterprise because some private personnel have shortcomings. Of course, if the conditions are ripe for some small and medium-sized enterprises, it can be considered not to have public representatives, but this does not belong to the issue of changing this system.
	He believes that the current problem in enterprises is not whether or not to have public representatives, but the division of labor between the Party and the government within the enterprise. The Party branch should not interfere with or replace the work of the administrative side. He proposed that responsibilities should be clarified, and if the public side is a deputy, the deputy should obey the chief.
	Regarding whether the Federation of Industry and Commerce should have a Party member Deputy Secretary-General, he believes that Party member Deputy Secretaries-General play an important role in the Federation of Industry and Commerce. When a Party member Deputy Secretary-General in Guangdong was transferred away by the leadership, the Federation of Industry and Commerce did not want him to leave. Our Secretary-General is here and can testify to this. He said that some people are dissatisfied with Party member Deputy Secretaries-General, which should be analyzed. It is possible that the Party member Deputy Secretary-General has errors in his work style, or that the non-Party Secretary-General has factional sentiments. He said: I agree with Wu Xianji's speech yesterday. With a Party member Deputy Secretary-General, the Federation of Industry and Commerce can unite cadres, implement policies, supervise each other, and make progress together. Therefore, my opinion is: those that exist should be retained, and those that do not exist can be considered for establishment. Those with shortcomings should be educated.

	Li Yizan said: Capitalists feel ashamed of exploitation on the one hand, and feel that fixed interest is lovely, and are nostalgic for an exploitative life. Some even believe that seven years of fixed interest is not enough, and haggle over it, which shows the essence of bourgeois thought.
	He believes: denying the two-sidedness of the bourgeoisie is essentially denying the necessity of further transformation of the bourgeoisie.
	Li Yizan, Secretary-General of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce, first spoke on the issue of class relations and two-sidedness. He said: Class relations are an objective existence, not something that can be dispensed with. There are both class relations and cooperative relations within joint ventures. How to correctly handle this dual relationship requires the joint efforts of both parties.
	Two-sidedness is the characteristic of the Chinese national bourgeoisie. After the high tide, the two-sidedness of the Chinese national bourgeoisie has also undergone great changes with the change of the relations of production in enterprises. The positive side is the mainstream, and the negative side has greatly diminished. This progress is determined by their social status. However, due to the existence of class relations, the negativity of the national bourgeoisie still exists. It is not realistic to deny it. The main content of the two-sidedness at this stage is: in the process of completely eliminating the system of exploitation, on the one hand, they feel ashamed of exploitation and are willing to create conditions to work hard to abandon exploitation; on the other hand, they feel that fixed interest is lovely and are nostalgic for an exploitative life. Some even believe that seven years of fixed interest is not enough and the time should be extended, haggling over it, which shows the essence of bourgeois thought.
	However, it should be seen that the entire class is differentiating. A part of small and medium-sized industrialists and merchants originally engaged in labor, and their fixed interest income is not much. Chairman Mao said that they are petty bourgeoisie. They are willing to give up exploitation and remove their hats as soon as possible. We hope that the government will consider gradually satisfying their wishes. Therefore, the two-sidedness of the national bourgeoisie should not include these people.
	In addition, some industrialists and merchants have developed a sense of pride and complacency after the joint ventures, and they have a visitor mentality toward the enterprise, and there is disunity between private entities. Although this kind of thinking is not unique to the bourgeoisie, it is particularly serious among bourgeois elements.
	Some people are complacent and arrogant, believing that they have completed their transformation and no longer need to study hard. Some people believe that they have handed over their enterprises, which is unprecedented in the world. I believe that this glory should belong to the Communist Party of China and the people of the whole country, and should never be taken as pride. Some people say: "The working class entered socialism empty-handed, and the bourgeoisie came in with gifts." This statement makes it seem that the bourgeoisie is more glorious than the working class, which is absolutely unacceptable. The enormous price paid by the Communist Party of China and the working class for revolution and construction is incomparable to the contribution of the Chinese national bourgeoisie to the country.
	In the past year, the cooperative relationship between the public and private sectors in joint ventures has improved, but it is still not normal. Some people still have concerns. They are afraid of being rectified and retaliated against. I believe that overemphasizing class relations within joint ventures hinders the cooperative relationship between the public and private sectors. A part of the public representatives are promoted from the employees of the enterprise. Their political level is not high, and they are accustomed to the old methods of class struggle. They are always wary of the private sector, fearing that they will be tainted by the bourgeois stain, and regard the cooperative relationship as a class relationship. The private sector also has a sense of inferiority and is hesitant to work, like "Lin Daiyu in the Grand View Garden, after all, an outsider." I believe that the private sector should be praised for their achievements and criticized for their mistakes. Relevant documents should be shown to them, and relevant meetings should be allowed to participate.
	Next, he talked about some specific problems existing in joint ventures. He said: In the past, the personnel arrangements were generally reasonable, but some who did not use what they learned should be adjusted. Rewards and punishments should be clear, with promotions and demotions. Welfare should be gradually treated equally. In labor competitions, the private sector and employees should be compared uniformly according to the size of the achievements.
	Finally, he talked about the issue of workers' class learning. He said: Since the Dagongbao published Wu Jincui's article "What to Learn from the Working Class," industrialists and merchants in various places are having heated discussions. I believe that in the transition of Chinese national bourgeois elements to the working people, they should not use class prejudices to look at problems with the working class, and should recognize the excellent qualities of the working class from the role of the working class in the great socialist construction cause in recent years. If it were not for the country led by the working class, and if there were no ideological leadership of the working class, there would be no such achievements. It is a fact that individual workers have backward sentiments, and they are also in the process of transformation. One cannot generalize the working class and the bourgeoisie into the category of advanced and backward. There is a difference between the two-sidedness of the bourgeoisie and the backward performance of individual workers. Some people say that the bourgeoisie has no two-sidedness, only one-sidedness. Even if they admit that there is two-sidedness, it is only the same as the working class. This statement is incorrect. This kind of thinking, in essence, denies the necessity and possibility of the national bourgeoisie to further accept transformation, and the importance of changing the nature of the class. We must learn the advanced thinking of the working class and their excellent qualities of being selfless, opposing exploitation, collectivism, and being good at collaboration. This is good for us.

	Meng Yuqing said:
	It is necessary to respect the customs and habits of ethnic minorities.
	Meng Yuqing, Deputy Manager of Tianjin Printing and Dyeing Company, expressed his views on further exerting the supervisory role of the Democratic National Construction Association and the Federation of Industry and Commerce. He said: In the implementation of some specific measures for the transformation of the private sector, the Party's reliance on democratic parties and the Federation of Industry and Commerce for discussion and research is not enough. For example, the method of subsidies for the birth, old age, sickness and death of private personnel and the method of wage payment are not consistent in the lower levels, resulting in some private personnel not being able to get reasonable care for their birth, old age, sickness and death, which affects their work enthusiasm. The Democratic National Construction Association and the Federation of Industry and Commerce are unable to explain and educate them because they do not understand the situation.
	At the meeting, he also pointed out that some public representatives do not respect the customs and habits of ethnic minorities. When merging stores after the joint venture, they actually adopted a majority vote method to merge Hui Muslim food stores and Han Chinese food stores, or sent Hui Muslims to work in Han Chinese restaurants. Hui Muslims have great opinions, which affects ethnic unity. (When he said this, Li Weihan, Minister of the United Front Work Department, interjected: "This problem should be solved. It is very bad to do this." and asked him to write a report to be transferred to the relevant departments for handling.)

	Ning Sihong said:
	The personnel, security, and labor and wage work of the industrial and commercial departments are all led by Communist Party members, and they only listen to the one-sided words of the employees. He advocated that the personnel departments at all levels should be open and allow non-Party members to enter.
	Ning Sihong, Deputy Manager of Shanghai Leather Industry Company, focused on raising his opinions on the personnel, security, and labor and wage work of some public-private joint ventures in Shanghai.
	He said that the personnel, security, and labor and wage work of the industrial and commercial departments are all led by Communist Party members. The leadership relationship is vertically managed, and the tendencies of bureaucracy, subjectivism, and sectarianism are serious. The handling of problems is simplified, and they only listen to the one-sided words of the employees. Many people dare not speak out. They respect and fear the personnel department. These departments should be the focus of this rectification.
	He said that the personnel department was originally one of the functional departments and should serve production; but now the people in these departments are busy all day long and do not know what they are doing. Some people say that the personnel department has become a派出所 (police substation) of the public security department, which is not without reason. Although the Party calls for caring for people, those who do personnel work in enterprises do not care for people, so that people cannot feel warmth. He also said that some people even regard the cadres of the personnel department as "thugs."
	He believes that another serious problem existing in these departments is the tendency of sectarianism. For example, in the Shanghai branch of the Joint Venture Bank, all the section chiefs were promoted to department heads, and all the Party members were promoted to division heads, while some private personnel had more than 20 years of banking experience, but still only served as section chiefs. It has become "using people based solely on Party membership." He also said: The Party member cadres of the Shanghai Zhonghua Shipyard also transferred their lovers to the factory, which has simply become "one Arhat, one Guanyin."
	He hopes that the central labor and personnel departments will put efforts into educating the cadres of the labor and personnel departments; the personnel and labor departments at all levels should be open and allow non-Party members to enter.

	Yu Xizhong reflected the opinions of young industrialists and merchants of small and medium-sized enterprises:
	Very angry to see the suggestion of extending fixed interest for 20 years
	Public representatives must not be withdrawn, otherwise the employees and the private sector, and the private sector with private sector will be chaos.
	The fifth speaker was Yu Xizhong, Deputy Manager of Beijing No. 2 Hardware Industry Company. He is a young industrialist and merchant. At the meeting, he focused on reflecting the opinions and demands of young industrialists and merchants of small and medium-sized enterprises. He said: Now the young industrialists and merchants of small and medium-sized enterprises generally urgently demand to give up fixed interest and remove the hat of "capitalist," but no one cares about their opinions. Therefore, some people are unwilling to admit that taking fixed interest is exploitation. They said: "We ourselves are unwilling to take fixed interest and unwilling to be capitalists, but they insist on letting us take it and insist on letting us be it!" Yu Xizhong said: The young industrialists and merchants of small and medium-sized enterprises were very angry when they saw Li Kangnian's proposal to extend fixed interest for 20 years. Some even said that if he made the proposal again, they would bite his ears. We don't want to be capitalists forever. We are willing to dedicate our youth to the motherland.
	Next, he expressed his views on the issue of sick leave wages for industrialists and merchants and the issue of the authority of private personnel in joint ventures. He believes that there is no advantage in dividing the principle of handling sick leave wages by 2,000 yuan. There are not many people who are really sick, but such a division makes most people panic.
	He disagreed with the suggestion that the fact that private personnel in joint ventures have positions but no authority is caused by the existence of public representatives. He said: Public representatives must not be withdrawn, otherwise there will be chaos among workers, employees and the private sector, and the private sector with the private sector. No one will persuade them if they fight.
	Finally, he raised opinions on the leaders of the municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce and the municipal Democratic National Construction Association on behalf of the industrialists and merchants in Beijing. He said: Now the leaders of the municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce and the municipal Democratic National Construction Association have actually become professional activists. They have obtained "fame, wealth, and enjoyment," and cannot understand the difficulties and demands of small and medium-sized industrialists and merchants (including myself, I have not actively reflected their opinions and demands, and I feel very ashamed when I examine myself). They nod and bow to the Party, try their best to maintain their position. Some people say that they are "representatives but not representatives, representatives but not representative of people." We have not seen them release any singing; even if they do, it is just perfunctory. Some upper-level representatives criticize us and say: "The big ones make trouble for their position, and the small ones make trouble for their lives." Everyone has great opinions on this statement, believing that their position is already very high, and there is nothing to make trouble for, and their lives are not a problem, so they say such things. They only listen to their words to the Party, and they also have opinions. I hope the Party will pay attention to observing which of them are truly for the country and for the masses, and which of them are for themselves.

	Zhu Songling said:
	Private technical personnel should be treated equally
	Zhu Songling, Director of Shanghai Sanying Electric Factory, said: After the high tide, many private personnel with technology were eager to contribute their technical strength and do more for increasing production and saving. Unfortunately, some leading departments have adopted a bureaucratic and departmentalist attitude towards the technical achievements of private technical personnel, which has affected their enthusiasm. For example, Zhang Zhongkang, a private technical personnel in Shanghai Dawei Electric Factory, invented an electric Chinese typewriter, which is twice as efficient as the old typewriter, but their factory belongs to heavy industry, and this product belongs to the scope of light industry, so the leadership does not allow production.
	Some units also discriminate against private technical personnel. He said that once they went to state-owned factories to exchange experiences in order to solve a technical problem, and they brought an introduction letter from the Industrial Bureau, but they were not allowed to enter. They were required to have an introduction letter from the Municipal People's Committee. After having an introduction letter from the Municipal People's Committee, they were required to bring personnel materials. In short, they would be unlucky when encountering the word "private." He asked the relevant departments to attach importance to solving this problem, and to treat private technical personnel equally.

    王伯雄、于熙钟在工商界座谈会上说
    公方代表不能撤出
    本报讯　由中共中央统战部主持的全国工商界座谈会于昨日（22日）继续举行第七次座谈。今日休会，明日将继续进行。
    王伯雄说：如果不设公方代表，职工与私方、私方与私方的矛盾谁来解决？
      党员副秘书长在工商联有重要作用，不能不要
    中国民主建国会广东代表、广东工商改造辅导处处长王伯雄在座谈会上讲两个问题：一是公私合营企业要不要有公方代表；二是工商联要不要有党员副秘书长。他说：有些人认为公私合营企业里有了公方代表就会有公私关系，并且影响企业的发展，我认为这个看法是不全面的，我要求这些人正视这样一些事实：从企业的发展来看，广州的合营企业有了公方的领导，生产提高30％以上；从公私关系来看，关系愈来愈好，不好的只是少数；从私方积极性来看，在社会主义竞赛中很多人受到了表扬。这个情况说明了公方代表制度的必要性。
    假如不设公方代表会有什么困难呢？我看，有很大的困难，第一，职工与私方的矛盾无人解决，私方在今天还是资产阶级，他们跟工人阶级的思想不是没有距离的。第二，合并的企业私私之间纠纷很多，谁都不服谁，他们互相勾心斗角，排挤打击。有一个厂为了厂的名字，争执了一个月，相持不下，后来经过公方代表的帮助才得到解决。所以合营企业的公方代表制的存在对于贯彻国家生产计划和政策，领导职工搞好私私关系有很大的好处。取消公方代表，害多利少。
    为什么某些私方人员对公方代表会有不满情绪呢？他认为某些公方人员对私方进步性估计不足，忽视私方的意见，而私方人员也有缺点。过去，私营企业长期以我为主，独断专行；合营后对集体领导不习惯，甚至不满意；其次，过惯了自由散漫生活，对建立制度觉得不方便；其三、看不起公方代表，认为他们不懂技术，他认为公私双方虽然都有缺点，而解决这个矛盾公方应负主要责任。
    谈到正确对待公私关系问题的时候，他说，总的情况是好的，不能因为某些公方代表有缺点就不要公方代表制；这正如不能因为某些私方人员有缺点就叫私方离开企业一样。当然，如果某些中小企业条件成熟，也可以考虑不设公方代表，但，不属于改变这个制度问题。
    他认为目前企业的问题不是要不要公方代表问题，而是企业内部的党政分工问题，党支部不要干涉和代替行政方面的工作。他提议要明确职责，如果公方是副职，副职要服从正职。
    关于工商联要不要党员副秘书长，他认为党员副秘书长在工商联有着重要的作用，广东有个党员副秘书长被领导上调走时，工商联就不愿意他走。我们的秘书长在场，可以证明。他说，有些人对党员副秘书长不满，要加以分析，可能党员副秘书长作风上有错误，也可能非党秘书长有宗派情绪。他说：我同意昨天吴咸吉的发言，工商联有了党员副秘书长可以团结干部、贯彻政策，可以互相监督、共同进步，因此，我的意见：凡是有的要保留，没有的可以考虑增设，有缺点的不好的要给以教育。
    李贻赞说：资本家一方面感到剥削可耻，一方面觉得定息可爱，留恋剥削生活。有的人甚至认为定息七年还不够，斤斤较量，这正表现了资产阶级思想的本质。
    他认为：否认资产阶级的两面性，本质上是否定资产阶级进一步改造的必要性。
    北京市工商联秘书长李贻赞首先就阶级关系和两面性问题发言。他说：阶级关系是个客观存在，不是可有可无的。合营企业内部既有阶级关系又有共事关系，如何正确处理这个双重关系，需要双方共同努力。
    两面性是中国民族资产阶级的特性，高潮以后，中国民族资产阶级的两面性随着企业生产关系的改变也起了很大的变化，积极的一面是主流，消极一面大大减退，这种进步是由于他们的社会地位决定的。但由于阶级关系的存在，民族资产阶级的消极性仍然存在，不承认是不合实际的，现阶段的两面性内容主要是：在彻底消灭剥削制度的过程中，一方面感到剥削可耻，愿意创造条件为放弃剥削而努力，另一方面觉得定息可爱，留恋剥削生活，有的人甚至认为定息七年还不够，时间还要延长，斤斤较量，这正表现了资产阶级思想的本质。
    但是，应该看到：整个阶级正在分化。有一部分中小工商业者自己本来从事劳动，定息收入不多，毛主席说他们是小资产阶级。他们愿意早日放弃剥削摘掉帽子。望政府考虑逐步满足他们的愿望。所以民族资产阶级两面性，不应该包括这些人在内。
    另外还有一部分工商业者在合营后产生骄傲自满情绪，对企业有作客思想，私私之间存在不团结现象。这种思想虽然不是资产阶级所独有，但是，资产阶级分子表现特别严重。
    有些人居功自傲，认为自己已经改造完成，不需要再努力学习了。有些人认为自己交出了企业，在国际上是史无前例的。我认为这种光荣应该属于中国共产党和全国人民，决不可以引为骄傲。有人说：“工人阶级进入社会主义是赤手空拳，资产阶级是带着礼物进来的”，这种说法，好像资产阶级比工人阶级还光荣，这是万万不可的。中国共产党和工人阶级为革命和建设所付出的巨大的代价与中国民族资产阶级对国家的贡献来衡量是无可比拟的。
    一年来合营企业中公私共事关系是有进步的，但还不正常，有些人还有顾虑，他们怕挨整、怕报复。我认为在合营企业内部过分强调阶级关系，对公私共事关系是有妨碍的。有一部分公方代表，是由企业职工中提拔的，他们的政治水平不高，习惯于过去阶级斗争的一套，对私方人员时存戒心，惟恐染上资产阶级的污点，把共事关系当成阶级关系。私方人员也有自卑感，对工作缩手缩脚，像“大观园的林黛玉，终是外人”的样子，我认为对有成绩的私方应该表扬，有错误应予批评，有关文件应给他们看，有关会议应让他们参加。
    接着，他谈了一些关于合营企业中存在的一些具体问题，他说：过去人事安排大体是合理的，但是有些学非所用的应该予以调整。应当赏罚分明，有升有降。对于生活福利要逐步做到一视同仁，在劳动竞赛中，对于私方人员和职工应按成绩大小，统一评比。
    最后，他谈到的工人阶级学习问题：他说：自从大公报发表了吴金萃“向工人阶级学习什么”的文章以后，各地工商业者正在热烈的讨论。我认为中国民族资产阶级分子在向劳动人民过渡中，对工人阶级不要用阶级成见去看问题，应该从几年来伟大社会主义建设事业中工人阶级的作用来认识工人阶级的优良品质。如果不是工人阶级领导的国家，如果没有工人阶级的思想领导，就不能有这样的成就。个别工人有落后情绪是事实，现在他们同样在改造过程中，不能笼统地把工人阶级和资产阶级都归到先进与落后的范畴，资产阶级两面性与个别工人的落后表现是有区别的。有人说资产阶级没有两面性了，只有一面性，即使承认有两面性也只是与工人阶级一样的，这种说法是不正确的。这种思想，本质上是否定了民族资产阶级进一步接受改造的必要性和可能性，改变阶级本质的重要性。我们要学习工人阶级先进思想和他们具有大公无私、反对剥削、集体主义、善于协作的优良品质。这样对我们是有好处的。孟羽卿说：
    要尊重少数民族风俗习惯
    天津市印染公司副理孟羽卿就进一步发挥民建会和工商联组织的监督作用发表意见。他说：在贯彻对私改造的一些具体措施中，党依靠民主党派和工商联组织讨论研究不够。如私方人员的生老病死补助办法和工资支付办法，下边执行得不一致，致使有些私方人员生老病死得不到合理照顾，影响他们的工作积极性。而民建会和工商联由于不了解情况，又无法进行解释教育。
    在会上，他又提出，有些公方代表不尊重少数民族的风俗习惯，在合营后并店时，竟采取多数表决的办法，把回民食品店和汉民食品店并在一起，或派回民到汉民饭馆去工作，回民意见很大，影响民族团结。（他说到这里，统战部李维汉部长插话：“应该解决这个问题，这样搞很不好。”并请他写个材料转给有关部门处理。）宁思宏说：
    工商部门的人事、保卫、劳动工资等工作都是共产党员领导，只听职工一面之辞。他主张：各级人事科室都应该开放，让非党人士进去。
    上海制革工业公司副经理宁思宏发言中着重对上海某些公私合营企业的人事、保卫、劳动工资等工作提了意见。
    他说，工商部门的人事、保卫、劳动工资等工作都是共产党员领导的，领导关系条条垂直，官僚主义、主观主义和宗派主义的倾向严重，处理问题简单化，只听职工一面之辞。很多人有话不敢讲。对人事科敬而畏之。这些部门应该是这次整风的重点。
    他说，本来人事部门是职能科室之一，应为生产服务；但现在这些部门的人都整天忙忙碌碌不知所事何事。有人讲人事科已成了公安部门的派出所，这不是没有道理的。虽然党号召关心人，但这些作人事工作的在企业中却不关心人，使人们感觉不到温暖。他又说，有人甚至把人事科的干部看成“打手”。
    他认为这些部门存在的另一严重问题是宗派主义倾向。例如合营银行上海分行在合营时，室主任都升了科长，党员都升了处长，而有的私方人员已有二十多年的银行业务经验，却仍只担任科长。成了“用人唯党”。他还说：上海中华造船厂的党员干部把爱人也调到工厂里，简直成了“一尊罗汉，一尊观音”。
    他希望中央劳动和人事部门，对劳动和人事部门的干部下功夫进行教育；各级人事劳动科室，都应开放，让非党人士进去。
    于熙钟反映中小户青年工商业者的意见：
    看到延长定息二十年的意见很生气
    公方代表千万不要撤走，否则职工与私方，私方与私方之间非乱不可。
    第五个发言的是北京市第二五金工业公司副理于熙钟。他是一位年青的工商业者，他在会上着重反映了中小户青年工商业者的意见和要求。他说：现在一般中小户青年工商业者都迫切要求放弃定息，摘掉“资本家”的帽子，但是，提意见没有人管。因此，有的人拿了定息也不愿承认是剥削，他们说：“我们自己不愿拿定息，不愿当资本家，偏让我们拿、偏让我们当！”于熙钟说：中小户青年工商业者看了李康年提出的延长定息二十年的意见都很生气，有的甚至说再提就咬他的耳朵，我们不愿意老当资本家，我们愿意把自己的青春献给祖国。
    接着，他又对工商业者的病假工资问题和合营企业中私方人员职权问题发表了意见。他认为病假工资的处理原则以两千元上下来划分看不出有什么好处，真正有病的人不多，但是这样一划分，惹得多数人惶惶不安。
    他不同意有人提出的私方人员有职无权是由于有公方代表存在造成的，他说：公方代表千万不要撤走，否则工人之间、职工和私方之间、私私之间非乱不可，打起架来都没人劝。
    最后，他代表北京市工商业者对市工商联和市民建会领导人员提出意见。他说：现在市工商联和市民建会的领导人员实际上成了职业活动家，他们得到了“名、利、享”，体会不到中小工商业者的困难和要求（连我自己也在内，没有积极反映他们的意见和要求，检查起来觉得很可耻）。他们在党的面前点头哈腰，唯唯诺诺，想尽办法保持自己的地位。有人说他们是“代而不表，表而不代”。我们没有看到他们放出鸣声；即使有，也是应付差事。有的上层代表批评我们说：“大的闹地位，小的闹生活”，大家对这种说法很有意见，认为他们的地位已经很高了，没什么可闹的，生活也没有问题，所以才说这样的话。对党只听他们的话，也有意见。希望党要注意观察他们之中哪些人是真正为国家、为群众，哪些人是为了自己。朱松龄说：
    对待私方技术人员要一视同仁
    上海三英电业厂厂长朱松龄说：在高潮以后，很多有技术的私方人员，都热望着把自己的技术力量贡献出来，为增产节约多做些事情。可惜有些领导部门对私方技术人员的技术成就采取了官僚主义和本位主义的态度，影响了他们的积极性。例如：上海大威电机厂有个私方技术人员张忠康曾创造了一种电动中文打字机，打字效率比老式打字机高一倍，但他们厂属于重工业，而这种产品属于轻工业范围，领导上就不许生产。
    还有一些单位歧视私方技术人员。他说，有一次他们为了解决一个技术问题，到国营厂里交流经验，带工业局的介绍信，不许进，要有市人民委员会的介绍信，有了市人民委员会的介绍信以后，又提出带人事材料才可以。总之遇到“私”字就要倒霉。他要求有关部门重视解决这一问题，对待私方技术人员，要一视同仁。
