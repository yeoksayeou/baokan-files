The price increase of Non-Staple Foods is Too High
It is understood that among the forty kinds of non-staple foods in Harbin, none have not increased in price. The lower increases are 20%, and the higher increases are 100%, which has a great impact on people's lives.

Although the price increase of high-end consumer goods does not affect the lives of most people, the price increase of woolen fabrics involves the price increase of more than 800 kinds of commodities such as shoes, hats, and clothing, which affects the broad masses of people.

It is hoped that the leading authorities will strengthen the management of market prices, not allow certain manufacturers to raise prices freely, reduce prices that are too high, and explain clearly to the masses why prices should be increased. Hua Zhi

    副食品价格上涨幅度太大
    据了解，哈尔滨市四十种副食品中没有一种不上涨的，低的上涨20％，高的上涨100％，这对人民的生活影响较大。
    高级消费品的提价虽然不影响大多数人的生活；但是，其中呢绒价格上涨就牵涉到鞋、帽、服装等八百多种商品价格的上涨，这对广大人民是有影响的。
    希望领导机关对市场物价加强管理，不允许某些厂商自由提价，提价过高的应该降下来，应该提价的也要向群众讲解清楚。　华之
