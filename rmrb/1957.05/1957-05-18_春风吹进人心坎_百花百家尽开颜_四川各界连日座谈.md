　　Chengdu, May 17th. Over the past week, various democratic parties, schools, government organs, literary and art circles, and industrial and commercial circles in Sichuan have held symposiums one after another. In the spirit of speaking out freely, they have put forward opinions to the party committees and leading organs to actively help the Party carry out rectification. People are using "The spring breeze blows into people's hearts, let a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" to describe the unprecedentedly active democratic life.

　　The symposiums of democratic figures convened by the United Front Work Department of the Provincial Party Committee have already been held five times. At the meetings, democratic figures made sharp criticisms of the separation of party and government, the privileged thinking of party members, and the sectarianism of not respecting the powers and responsibilities of non-party members. Li Jieren, vice mayor of Chengdu and veteran writer, cited specific examples and criticized the Provincial Party Committee for being aloof, divorced from the masses, and interfering too much in the work of the city. He said that due to the sectarianism of party members, he had been in a "vacuum zone" for several years. He hoped that the Party would collect more specific materials during the rectification and dig deeper into the roots of the "three strangenesses." Liu Wenhui, vice chairman of the Provincial Political Consultative Conference, said that in order to enable non-party members to have power and responsibility and to fulfill their duties, it is first necessary to require party member cadres to earnestly implement the principle of collective leadership and division of labor and responsibility, and to give sufficient respect to the powers and responsibilities of non-party members.

　　Many writers have held symposiums at the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles for days, exposing the sectarianism and dogmatism in the literary and art circles, as well as the conservative thinking in the reform of Sichuan opera and the bureaucracy of not caring about folk art and folk artists. Li Yaqun, deputy director of the Propaganda Department of the Provincial Party Committee, made a self-criticism of his one-sided understanding of the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend, as well as the simple and crude manner of criticizing "Grass and Trees." However, he believes that the nature of "Grass and Trees" and "The Young Man Newly Arrived in the Organization Department" are different. Liu Shahe, the author of "Grass and Trees," said that there were feelings of arrogance and aloofness in "Grass and Trees" and should be criticized, but it was not poisonous weed and should not be subject to dogmatic criticism in a club-wielding manner. He said that he was dissatisfied with certain things in the real society, but not dissatisfied with the socialist system. This issue is still being discussed.

　　The Party committees of Sichuan University, Sichuan University of Finance and Economics, Normal University, Medical University, Chengdu Institute of Technology, and Sports Institute also held large-scale meetings to listen to opinions from all sides. Many professors criticized the pride and complacency of some party members, the official style overwhelming the academic style, and the reluctance to let people speak freely. Zhang Zehou, a professor in the Chinese Department of Sichuan Normal University, said that the school Party committee was partial to some and believed others, and did not respect the democratic parties, resulting in some democratic party members holding negative attitudes such as keeping their mouths shut, seeking peace of mind, doing less is better than doing more, kowtowing more and talking less, and swallowing blood after knocking out their teeth. He suggested that the Party committee promote democracy, broaden the channels of communication, and consult with each other to run the school well.

### “春风吹进人心坎　百花百家尽开颜”  四川各界连日座谈

    “春风吹进人心坎　百花百家尽开颜”
    四川各界连日座谈
    本报成都17日电　一周来四川各民主党派，学校，机关，文艺界，工商界，纷纷举行座谈会，本知无不言精神，给党委领导机关提出意见，积极帮助党开展整风。人们以 “春风吹进人心坎、百花百家尽开颜”，形容空前活跃的民主生活。
    省委统战部召开的民主人士座谈会已经开了五次，会上民主人士对党政不分、党员的特权思想，不尊重党外人士职权的宗派主义，作了尖锐批评。成都市副市长、老作家李劼人列举具体事例，对省委高高在上，脱离群众，对市的工作干涉过多，提出批评。他说，由于党员的宗派主义，几年来使他处于“真空地带”，他希望整风中党多收集具体材料，把“三怪”根子挖得更深些。省政协副主席刘文辉说，要使党外人士做到有职有权、守职尽责，首先要求党员干部认真贯彻集体领导分工负责的原则，对党外人士职权给予足够的尊重。
    许多作家连日来在省文联召开的座谈会上，揭发了文学艺术界的宗派主义、教条主义，以及川剧改革中的保守思想和不关心曲艺和民间艺人的官僚主义。省委宣传部副部长李亚群对自己片面理解百花齐放，百家争鸣政策，以及批评“草木篇”的简单粗暴方式作了检查。但是他认为“草木篇”和“组织部新来的青年人”两者的性质是不同的。“草木篇”的作者流沙河说，“草木篇”中有孤傲离群情绪，应受到批评，但是不是毒草，不应该受到棍子式的教条式的批评。他说他是对现实社会某些东西不满意，而不是不满意社会主义制度。这一问题还正在进行讨论。
    四川大学、四川财经、师范、医学、成都工学、体育等学院中共党委也大规模地召开会议，听取各方面意见。许多教授对某些党员中的骄傲自满，官风压倒学风，不敢放手鸣放提出批评。四川师范学院中文系教授张泽厚说，学校党委偏听偏信，不尊重民主党派，致使一些民主党派成员抱着守口如瓶，身心安宁、多一事不如少一事，多磕头少说话，打落牙齿和血吞等消极态度。他建议党委发扬民主，广开言路相互协商办好学校。
