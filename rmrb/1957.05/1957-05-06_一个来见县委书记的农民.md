    A Farmer Comes to See the County Party Secretary
    Han Chuan
  　Not long ago, the county committee formulated a new system: on the 14th and 29th of the lunar month, which are market days in the town, the county party secretary personally receives Communist Party members. The visiting guests invariably discuss individual organizational issues, disciplinary problems, or the insufficient democratic style of a certain grassroots organization, where their opinions are not adopted, even though they believe their opinions are one hundred percent correct. On this day, a farmer who claimed not to be a Communist Party member insisted on entering the county party secretary's reception room. He said he was not a Communist Party member; however, his younger brother was a Communist Party member, and he asked if the county party secretary would receive him. The county party secretary said that even if his younger brother were not a Communist Party member, the county committee would still welcome him to come and discuss any problems.
    "Please sit down!" The county party secretary poured a cup of tea from a thermos and handed it to him.
    "I've already had some. I drank two large bowls of plain boiled water in your reception room just now." The guest took the teacup with both hands, and placed it on a nearby small table. Because he was talking about the reception room, the guest remembered the receptionist, and he said: "Your comrade receptionist, like my younger brother, wouldn't allow me to see you. My younger brother said: 'They're very busy, and today is set aside for receiving Party members. What are you going for?' I said: 'Why don't you go for me then? You can say your older brother is building a house…'. He cut me off halfway: 'It's that house building again!—You go yourself!' So I went. Anyway, the Party is always talking about not being divorced from the masses, and I figured the county party secretary wouldn't chase me away no matter what. Your comrade receptionist, just like my younger brother, insisted on an organizational letter of introduction. Without a letter of introduction, he lied to me: 'The secretary has gone to the countryside and hasn't returned.' I thought to myself: 'Get out of here! It's reception day for Party members, how could he not be at home waiting!' So I found my way here. Secretary, am I delaying your work?"
    "No. We welcome you. Please continue!"
    "Actually, it's about the house building. Didn't I already tell you just now? This matter—I don't know if I should blame you, or blame myself?" He paused, as if realizing that "blame" was not the right word, and quickly changed it to: "I don't know if I should criticize you, or criticize myself?"
    Building a house... blaming—criticizing? The more he spoke, the less understandable it became; however, the county party secretary dared not interrupt him, and let him continue. He said his surname was Liu, and his name was Liu Xiaowa. His younger brother was called Liu Erwa. Erwa had joined the Communist Party very early; he was lagging behind, unwilling to stay up late at night for meetings, so he hadn't joined the Party. However, from the War of Resistance Against Japan onwards, whether it was rent reduction and interest reduction, production campaigns, land reform, cooperative mutual aid, until last year's advanced cooperative: "Wherever the Party pointed, I went." He said the Party hadn't pointed the wrong way, and he hadn't gone down the wrong road either. In the past, he and the landlord did heavy labor, and Erwa did some odd jobs. The two brothers were so tired all day long they were "groggy," but at the end of the year, they were still "completely broke." The Communist Party led them to stand up, and life got better day by day: the year before last, they rebuilt four rooms facing north, the year before that they built three rooms facing west, and last year they built three rooms facing east, with brick walls dividing the inner and outer courtyards, connected by a free-standing arch; this spring, they built a side gatehouse with two wide and bright doors.
    "Except for the rebuilt north-facing rooms, mostly old bricks were used; the rest are all new bricks." He asked the county party secretary: "You won't criticize me for extravagance and waste, will you? The children are growing up, and the house isn't big enough. Those few north-facing rooms that were divided need rebuilding, and the rest had to be built 'from the ground up'. You've been to our village before, haven't you? Out of the five hundred or so households in our village, more than three hundred have built new houses, and they're all brick. As soon as you enter the village, you see the blue bricks everywhere, like the spirit of socialist construction. Even the pig farms for collective pig raising in the agricultural cooperative are built of new blue bricks. One day, I ran into our cooperative director, Liu Shengxi, at the entrance to the village. You must know him, he used to be a heavy laborer, and we grew up together naked. A good person. He saw me staring at the pigsty and asked me, 'Do you have any comments?' What comments could I have? I patted the new bricks on the back wall of the pigsty and said to him: 'Before liberation, we couldn't even live in houses like this!'..."
    "Today, have you come to reflect on the extravagance and waste in the agricultural cooperative?"
    "No. I've come to talk to you about building a house. I'm not very clear about whether there's extravagance and waste in the agricultural cooperative. Please let me continue! I regretted building my side gatehouse this year as soon as it was finished."
    "What? Regretted it?"
    "Yes, I regretted it. As the saying goes, 'It's good to build a north-facing room, warm in the winter and cool in the summer'. The east and west rooms cost the same amount of money and effort. Why didn't I build north-facing rooms? Building the houses like your county committee, row after row of north-facing rooms, with windows on both sides, well-ventilated and bright, is so much better! I thought of this when I was building the side gatehouse. Building the side gatehouse was for the convenience of livestock carts going in and out, so that the carts could be kept in the gatehouse when it rained, to prevent the rain from damaging the carts. But after it was built, I realized that the livestock carts had already joined the cooperative. Wasn't building the side gatehouse a waste of time? I regret it to death. I was confused. Society has changed, but I'm still doing things the old way. Secretary, why don't you lead us in this regard? If you just reminded me, it would save me from regretting it for the rest of my life. I talked about this with the village cadres, and they said they only managed production, not house building. Secretary, don't you manage house building? If you don't manage it, who will? Anyway, I blame myself for most of this, but you have to take some of the blame too."
    Having said this, the guest remembered the "Front Gate" cigarette that the county party secretary had offered him when he entered the room. He tapped the cigarette on the table, looked at the county party secretary, waiting for an answer, and reached into his pocket for a match.

    一个来见县委书记的农民
    韩川
  　不久以前，县委会制定了一种新制度：每逢旧历14、29，都是城里大集的日子，县委书记亲自接待共产党员。来访的客人，无非是谈论些个别的组织问题、纪律问题，或者是某基层组织作风不够民主，他的意见不被采纳，而他的意见在他看来又是百分之百的正确之类。这天，有一位自称不是共产党员的农民，硬碰进县委书记的接待室。他说他不是共产党员；但是，他的弟弟是共产党员，问县委书记是否接待他？县委书记说：即使他的弟弟也不是共产党员，有问题到县委会来研究，县委会也非常欢迎。
    “请坐”！县委书记从暖水瓶里倒出一杯茶来递给他。
    “我喝过了。方才在你们传达室里喝了两大碗开白凉”。客人双手接过茶杯，顺便放在就近一张小桌子上，因为讲起了传达室，客人想起了传达员，他说：“你们的传达员同志，跟我的弟弟一样：不允许我来见你。我的弟弟说：‘人家挺忙，今天是抽空接见党员的，你去干什么’？我说：‘要不，你就替我去。你就说你的哥哥盖房子……’。他没有让我说完，就在半路里截住我：‘又是你那盖房子！——你自己去吧’！我去就我去，反正党天天讲不脱离群众，我约摸着县委书记无论如何不会把我撵出来。你们的传达员同志，跟我的弟弟一个想法，他非跟我要组织介绍信不可，没有介绍信他就胡弄我：‘书记下乡没有回来。’我肚子里边说：‘去你的吧！接待党员的日子，他哪能不在家里等着呢！’我就找到这里来了。书记同志：不耽搁你的工作吗？”
    “不。我们欢迎你。请你讲下去！”
    “其实就是因为盖房子的事，方才我不是已经跟你说过了么？这事情——我不知道应该埋怨你们，还是应该埋怨我自己？”他停住了，好像意识到“埋怨”用的不当，赶紧改口：“不知道应该批评你们，还是应该批评我自己”？
    盖房子……埋怨——批评？越说越听不明白；但是，县委书记不敢打断他的话头，让他继续说下去。他说他姓刘，名叫刘小娃。他的弟弟叫刘二娃。二娃很早就参加了共产党；他落后，不愿意黑夜里熬眼开会，所以没有参加党。但是，从抗日战争开始，无论是减租减息，生产运动，土地改革，合作互助，直到去年的高级社：“党指到那里，我就走到那里”。他说党没有指错路，他也没有走错路。从前他跟地主拦大活，二娃做一些零星工，弟兄俩一天到晚，累的“忘八二怔”；可是，一年到头，仍旧是“吊旦精光”。共产党领导着翻了身，日子一天比一天好起来：大前年翻盖了四间北上房，前年盖了三间西屋，去年又盖了三间东屋，卡子墙分成里外院，里外院由一个落地圈沟通着；今年春天又盖了一个梢门洞，安着两扇广亮大门。
    “除北上房是翻盖，大部分是旧砖外；其余都是新砖”。他问县委书记：“你不会批评我铺张浪费吧？孩子们大了，房子不够用，平分的那几间北屋要倒塌，翻盖了一下，其余就得‘平地起古堆’。你不是没到我们村里去过，我们村里五百来户，有三百多户盖了新房子，而且都是砖的，一进村你就看到青压压的，像一个社会主义建设的气魄。就连农业社集体养猪的猪场，也是青压压的新砖盖起来的。那一天在村头起碰到我们的社主任，他叫刘盛喜，你当然认得他，他也是拦大活出身，我们是在一起光着屁股长大的。好人。他看我正瞅猪圈，就问我‘你有什么意见？’我能有什么意见？我拍了拍猪圈后墙的新砖，对他说：‘解放以前，咱们都住不成这样的房子’！……”。
    “今天，你是不是来反映农业社的铺张浪费呢？”
    “不是。我是来跟你谈盖房子的事情。农业社里有没有铺张浪费，我不大清楚。你还是让我说下去吧！我今年的梢门洞刚盖好，就后悔了。”
    “什么？后悔了？”
    “是啊，就后悔了。常言说‘有钱盖北房，冬暖夏天凉’，东、西屋一样花钱，一样费工夫，我为什么不盖成北屋呢？把房子盖成你们县委会这样，一排一排的都是北屋，两面开窗，又通风，又敞亮，多好！我是从盖梢门洞想起来的。盖梢门洞是为了牲口大车出出进进方便，下雨时把大车放在门洞里，省得雨水把车淋坏。可是，盖起之后我才想起来，牲口大车早就入社了，梢门洞盖起来不是废物点心么？我后悔个死。我胡涂。社会变了，我还按照老样子办事。书记同志：你们为什么在这方面不领导我们呢？只要你们提醒我一句，就省得我后悔这下半辈子。我给村干部们谈论这件事，他们说他们只管生产，不管盖房子的事情。书记同志：盖房子的事情你们不管么？你们不管叫谁来管呢？反正这事情一多半埋怨我自己，一少半也得埋怨你们。”
    说到这里，客人才想起一进门时县委书记招待他的那枝“前门”烟，在桌子上磕了磕，两眼望着县委书记等候答案，一只手伸进自己的口袋掏出了洋火。
