    Watching Professor Guan Liang Paint Opera
    Jiang Wen

    The child said, "Uncle Guan, draw Guan Gong!"
    "Okay!" The old man earnestly started to paint. After he finished, the child said again:
    "Uncle Guan, draw 'Little Shepherd Boy'!" The old man then earnestly painted again.
    "Uncle Guan, draw 'Liang Shanbo'!"
    "Uncle Guan, draw 'Yang Guifei'!"
    "...Draw 'Zhou Cang'!"
    Whatever the child said, Mr. Guan Liang would paint it, always slowly and earnestly.
    Friends who asked him to paint also received the same obliging response, truly "fair to both young and old."
    Mr. Guan's paintings are liked by many people, that goes without saying; but the fact that children can also understand and like them is very interesting. Children always watch Mr. Guan Liang paint with such devotion, for whole hours at a time. I think Mr. Guan's paintings have a strong entertainment value.
    A famous actor sings exactly what the audience wants to hear and is familiar with, leaving no regrets in the performance and singing, that is a true famous actor.
    Listening to a novice's symphony, a certain section feels like it should be a "2," but suddenly it's a "5," not only is it a shock, but it's also uncomfortable for quite some time.
    Painting is the same, sometimes it should be slow and gentle like a stream, sometimes it should be as vast as ten thousand horses galloping. Whether bold or delicate, it must be skilled and natural, completely like it was done unintentionally. No forcing, no yelling, no sand in the rice, no scratching where it doesn't itch. How much effort does it take to acquire this skill?
    Reading Mr. Guan Liang's Peking Opera figure paintings often feels like watching a famous actor perform. Watching Ma Lianliang, Tan Fuying, Zhou Xinfang, Mei Lanfang, Xiao Changhua, Ma Jinlu, watching the past Jin Shaoshan and the present Qiu Shengrong, watching how these masters control their talents. There are no new actors in his paintings. New actors can't be so "handsome."
    I heard that Mr. Guan Liang is good friends with the elderly Gai Jiaotian. If the rumor is true, then it makes sense; the elderly Gai Jiaotian's research on life is very famous.
    How an artist studies life is often reflected in the depth of expression of the artwork. I think Mr. Guan Liang has also done a lot of research on Peking Opera in this regard.

    看关良教授画戏
  　江纹
    孩子说：“关伯伯，画个关公吧！”
    “好！”老伯伯就认真地画起来。画好了，孩子又说：
    “关伯伯，画个‘小放牛’吧！”老伯伯就又认真地画起来。
    “关伯伯，你画个‘梁山伯’吧！”
    “关伯伯，你画个‘杨贵妃’吧！”
    “……你画个‘周仓’吧！”
    孩子说甚么，关良先生就画甚么，总是那么慢慢地、认真地画出来。
    朋友们请他画，也是这样有求必应，简直是“童叟无欺”。
    关先生的画，是有不少人喜欢的，那不用说；孩子居然也看得懂，也喜欢，就很有意思。孩子总是那么倾心地看关良先生画画，整个钟头地看。我想，关先生的画娱乐性是很强的。
    名角唱戏，唱的恰好就是听众所要听的、所熟悉的，没有遗憾留在表演和唱腔中，那就是真名角。
    听演奏生手的交响曲，某一段的某一节明明觉得来个“2”才好，而忽然是个“5”，吓一跳不算，还得难受好些时候。
    画画也是这样，有时要舒慢徐缓如小溪流水，有时要浩荡如万马奔腾，不管豪迈和纤细，都得熟练自然，完全像不经意地做出来。不勉强，不声嘶力竭，不饭里夹砂，不搔不着痒处，这种本领要经过多少折腾？
    读关良先生的京戏人物画，常易觉得像在看名角演戏。看马连良、谭富英，看周信芳、梅兰芳，看萧长华、马富禄，看过去的金少山和现在的裘盛戎，看这些大师怎样在驾驶他们的才能。在他的画中是没有新角儿的。新角儿不可能那么“帅”。
    听人说关良先生跟盖叫天老人是好朋友，如果传言没错，那就对了；盖叫天老人对生活的研究是很出名的。
    艺术家对生活的研究如何，往往反映在艺术品的表现深度上。关良先生对于京戏这方面的生活，我看也是很有研究的。
