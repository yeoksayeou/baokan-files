What is hindering the "Hundred Schools of Thought" in economic science? I believe the main problem is the tendency of dogmatism. It should be admitted that in the past few years, investigation and research in economic science have been insufficient. In writing articles, there is much manipulation of concepts, but very little in-depth, systematic, and meticulous investigation and research. Manipulating concepts is so easy. With a certain level of education, one can buy a few Marxist classics, browse textbooks, and find some material from newspapers that fits one's subjective desires, and then write an article. But in-depth investigation and research require hard work, tireless effort, and the work of many unsung heroes, which is much more difficult than manipulating concepts. In the past year or two, there has been "contention" in economic science, such as the basic economic laws of the transition period, the nature of the contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, whether fixed interest is surplus value, and the advanced or backward nature of productive forces and production relations. Some of these "contests" have been very lively, and these discussions have had some effect and should continue to be encouraged. However, it cannot be denied that some of the papers suffer from very serious dogmatic symptoms. These articles lack sufficient material and convincing arguments, and only make a fuss based on a definition by Stalin or by rigidly clinging to one or two sentences in Marxism. After arguing for a long time, you cannot convince me, and I cannot convince you, because everyone is basing their arguments on things from books, conceptual games. As for occupying a large amount of material, using Marxist methods to analyze problems and study problems, generally speaking, it is still rare.

Generally, everyone is afraid to touch practical economic problems. There are two reasons: First, there is a lack of understanding of the actual situation. Many friends engaged in teaching or scientific research complain that they simply cannot get materials. Business departments emphasize that this is confidential and that is confidential. Apart from what is publicly published in newspapers, nothing can be obtained, so there is no way to start research. To talk about it reluctantly is like scratching an itch from afar, not touching the point; one is to regard policy measures or government decrees as objective economic laws. Most people in business work regard promoting policies and decrees as doing the best they can in research work. (Promoting policies and decrees is necessary, but it cannot replace scientific research.) Someone asked: Can we also contend on policies? When I went to Shenyang last year, many friends asked me this question. I think: policies can also be contended, because the government's policies are correct if they conform to the objective laws of development; and they are incorrect if they do not conform to the objective laws of development. The government is very cautious in formulating policies, but it is impossible to require that all policies are 100% correct and error-free. If we find that policies do not conform to the laws of development of things, why can't we raise opinions? However, the discussion of policies should be different from the discussion of academic thoughts in terms of method. First, this kind of discussion does not need to be publicly published in newspapers and periodicals, but should be carried out through appropriate means (such as submitting opinions to the competent authorities or business departments) or through appropriate institutions (such as the CPPCC, the National People's Congress, within political parties or people's organizations, scientific research institutions, etc.). Secondly, during the period of implementation, even if there are different opinions on the policies, they should be observed and implemented before the government announces the amendment or abolition of a certain policy.

Since liberation, the policies adopted by the government in the field of finance and economics have been basically correct. The great victory achieved by our country on the economic front in a short period of time is inseparable from the correct financial and economic policies adopted by the state. This point must be affirmed first. But we cannot say that every financial and economic measure taken by the government is flawless at every stage or in every link. I think we should encourage economic researchers to care about the government's financial and economic measures, study the government's financial and economic policies, and encourage them to provide opinions. But to do this, it is necessary to make the country's financial and economic situation understood by them in an appropriate way and give them the convenience of research. This is necessary to mobilize all positive factors to serve socialist construction.

Economic science is a science with practical significance. Without practice, there is no economic research. The advanced academic achievements of the Soviet Union are worthy of our learning, and we must learn them with humility. However, after all, the level of economic development in our country is different from that of the Soviet Union. The problems that occurred in Soviet economic practice are not necessarily the main problems in our country today, and the problems encountered in our economic construction are not necessarily the same as those in the Soviet Union. To make Chinese economic science develop independently, we must study the problems raised in China's economic practice based on China's specific conditions, advocate investigation and research, independent thinking, instead of mechanically copying and blindly imitating. I recently saw that some economic journals introduce academic trends in Soviet economic research in each issue, but rarely introduce academic trends in China's own economic research. Also, when some study materials introduce "discussions on the American economic crisis," they only introduce the Soviet Union, Democratic Germany, and other countries, but not China. Is it that there are no developments in China's economic academia, and no Chinese economic scholars have written papers on the American economic crisis? Obviously not. It is just that we do not pay attention or do not value it. I think: even if our country's economic research trends or academic works are immature, immature things can grow.

In the past few years, China's economic construction has been progressing rapidly, and the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce and the progress of agricultural collectivization have creatively developed Marxism-Leninism and enriched Marxist economics. Unfortunately, our economic science research work is too far behind the reality. It can be said that the contribution of economic science researchers to the country is not commensurate with the position we are in. In order to raise the theoretical level of our economic science, we must resolutely oppose dogmatism, advocate independent thinking, emphasize investigation and research, attach importance to collecting materials, and at the same time strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism, be good at distinguishing Marxism from dogmatism, and be good at using Marxist methods to analyze and study problems.

To launch a contention in the economic science field, we must also oppose sectarianism. Sectarianism in the economic field is mainly manifested in the tendency of closed-doorism. Many friends who study economic science are very dissatisfied with the sectarian style of some individual party members in our country. For example, after the Chinese Economic Association died without a disease (Comrade Tao Dayong said that "existing in name only" is not accurate, it has long been "dead in name and in fact"), many economists have requested to restore this organization, but so far there is no news, because individual party members are not interested in this, they would rather have a small circle than a big circle. Another example is that although "Economic Research" has an editorial board in name, it does not hold a meeting once a year. Those of us who are nominally members of the editorial board have no chance to offer opinions. Mr. Chen Hansheng often sighed with me about the difficulty of changing the deep-rooted sectarian style when talking about these situations. There are not many friends in China who study economics. If this narrow-minded style is not changed, how can we unite economists from all walks of life and liven up the atmosphere of economic research in our country!

    提倡独立思考，反对教条主义
    千家驹
    什么东西障碍着经济科学方面的百家争鸣呢？我认为主要是教条主义的倾向。应该承认，过去几年来，在经济科学研究方面，调查研究工作是做得很不够的。写文章，搬弄概念的多，而做深入的系统的周密的调查研究的却很少。搬弄概念，那多么省事呵，只要有一定的文化水平，买几本马克思主义的经典著作，翻翻教科书，再从报纸中找一点合于主观愿望的材料，便可以写出一篇文章来了。而做深入的调查研究却要花辛勤的劳动，不倦的努力，还要有许多无名英雄的工作，这就比搬弄概念困难得多了。过去一两年中，在经济科学中，并不是没有“争鸣”，例如关于过渡时期的基本经济规律问题，无产阶级和资产阶级的矛盾性质问题，定息是否剩余价值的问题以及生产力和生产关系的先进落后问题。有的还“争鸣”得非常热烈，这些讨论已收到了一定的效果，应该继续提倡。但是，不容讳言，其中有一部分论文是患非常严重的教条主义病症的，这种文章，既没有充分的材料，也没有令人信服的论据，而只是根据斯大林的一个定义或死啃马克思主义中的一两句话而大做文章，争论了半天，你既不能说服我，我也不能说服你，因为大家所根据的都是书本上的东西，概念化的游戏；至于占有大量材料，运用马克思主义的方法来分析问题研究问题的，一般说来还不多见。
    对于现实的经济问题，一般的大家都不敢碰，原因有二：一、对实际情况不了解，许多从事教学工作或科学研究工作的朋友都诉苦根本得不到材料，业务部门强调这也保密，那也保密，除报纸公开发表的东西外，什么也得不到，自无从研究起，勉强来谈，也等于隔靴搔痒，不着边际；一是把政策措施或政府的法令当成客观经济规律，搞业务工作的人大多是宣传一番政策法令便算是尽研究工作之能事。（宣传政策法令是必要的，但不能代替科学研究。）有人问：对方针政策是不是也可以争鸣？我去年到沈阳，有不少朋友这样问我。我认为：方针政策也是可以争鸣的，因为政府的方针政策有合乎客观发展规律的，那就是正确的；也有不合乎客观发展规律的，那就是不正确的。政府制定方针政策是非常慎重的，但是不可能要求所有的方针政策都百分之百地正确无误。如果我们发现方针政策有不符合事物发展规律的时候，为什么不可以提出意见来呢？不过对于方针政策的讨论，在方式上应不同于学术思想的讨论。第一，这种讨论不必拿到报纸刊物上去公开发表，应通过适当方式（如向主管机关或业务部门提出意见）或通过适当机构（如政协、人民代表大会、党派或人民团体内部、科学研究机关等）去进行。其次，在执行期间，当政府未宣布修改或废止某种政策以前，即使对方针政策有不同意见，也应该遵守执行。
    解放以来，政府在财政经济方面所采取的方针政策，基本上是正确的，我国之所以在短时期内取得经济战线上的伟大胜利，同国家所采取的正确的财经政策是不可分的，这一点我们必须首先肯定。但是我们也不能说，政府所采取的每一财经措施，在每一阶段或每一环节都是毫无缺点的。我认为，我们应该鼓励经济研究工作者关心政府的财经措施，研究政府的财经政策，并且鼓励他们提供意见。但要做到这一点，就必须使国家的财政经济情况，通过适当的方式，使他们有所了解，给他们以研究的便利。这对于调动一切积极因素为社会主义建设服务是有必要的。
    经济科学是一门具有现实意义的科学，离开了实际便谈不到经济研究。苏联的先进学术是值得我们学习的，而且我们必须虚心地去学习。但究竟我国经济发展的水平和苏联不同，苏联经济实践中所发生的问题不一定是我国当前的主要问题，而我国经济建设中所遇到的问题，也不一定等同于苏联。要使中国经济科学独立发展，就必须根据我国的具体情况，研究我国经济实践中所提出的问题，提倡调查研究，独立思考，而不是生搬硬套，生吞活剥。我最近看到有的经济刊物上每期介绍苏联经济研究方面的学术动态而没有或很少介绍过中国自己的经济研究方面的学术动态，也有的学习读物上介绍“关于美国经济危机的讨论”时，只介绍苏联、民主德国和其他国家的而就没有中国的。难道中国经济学术界就没有动态可介绍，中国经济学者中就没有人写过研究美国经济危机的论文吗？显然不是。这是我们自己不加注意或不重视罢了。我认为：我国的经济研究动态或学术论著即令是幼稚，但幼稚的东西是可以成长的啊。
    这几年来，我国的经济建设是一日千里，而资本主义工商业的社会主义改造和农业合作化的进展，创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义，丰富了马克思主义经济学。可惜我们的经济科学研究工作太落后于实际了。可以说，经济科学研究者对国家所作的贡献和我们所处的地位是太不相称了。为了把我们的经济科学理论水平提高一步，就必须坚决地反对教条主义，提倡独立思考，强调调查研究，重视搜集资料等工作，同时还必须加强对马克思列宁主义的学习，善于区别马克思主义同教条主义，善于运用马克思主义的方法来研究分析问题。
    要展开经济科学界的争鸣，必须同时反对宗派主义。经济学界的宗派主义主要表现在关门主义的倾向上。不少研究经济科学的朋友对我国某些个别党员同志的宗派主义作风是十分不满的，举例来说，中国经济学会无疾而终后（陶大镛同志说“名存实亡”还是不确切的，它早已“名实俱亡”），多少经济学者提出要求恢复这一组织，但迄今毫无音讯，因为个别党员同志对此不感兴趣，他们宁愿要小圈子不愿要大圈子。又如“经济研究”名义虽有一个编辑委员会，但经年不开一次会，我们这些忝为编委的人从无提意见的机会。陈翰笙先生每和我谈及这些情况，不禁长太息于宗派主义作风之积重难返。中国研究经济学的朋友本来不多，这种偏狭作风不改变，如何能团结各方面的经济学者，活跃我国经济研究的空气呢！
