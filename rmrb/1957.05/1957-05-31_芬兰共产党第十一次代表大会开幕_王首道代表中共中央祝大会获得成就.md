Xinhua News Agency, Helsinki, May 30th: The Eleventh Congress of the Communist Party of Finland opened in Helsinki on May 29th. The congress will hear a summary report on the work of the Party Central Committee, discuss a draft party program, revise the party constitution, and re-elect the party's leadership.

Representatives of fraternal Communist and Workers' parties from the Soviet Union, China, France, Italy, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Spain, and other countries attended the congress. The representative of the Communist Party of China was Wang Shoudao, a member of the Party Central Committee.

Aaltonen, Chairman of the Communist Party of Finland, delivered the opening speech. He pointed out the great significance of the Communist Party of Finland's adherence to the international proletarian solidarity and the advocacy of friendship among the peoples of all countries. He stated that the Communist Party of Finland is willing to cooperate with all those who oppose involving Finland in the military and political plans of Western countries, and with all those who safeguard Finland's peaceful foreign policy, and that the friendship and cooperation between Finland and the Soviet Union is the cornerstone of this policy.

Pessi, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Finland, delivered a summary report on the work on behalf of the Party Central Committee.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, May 30th: Helsinki News: Wang Shoudao, representative of the CPC Central Committee and member of the CPC Central Committee, delivered a congratulatory message to the Eleventh Congress of the Communist Party of Finland on the 29th and read out the congratulatory telegram from the CPC Central Committee.

Wang Shoudao said that over the long years, under extremely difficult conditions, the Communist Party of Finland has closely linked itself with the masses and carried out a tenacious struggle for the cause of liberation of the working class and the working people. Today, the Communist Party of Finland has become an important force in Finnish national life. We are extremely gratified and encouraged by the achievements you have made.

Wang Shoudao continued: What makes us especially happy is that in those days when international reactionary forces launched a frenzied attack on peace and socialism in 1956, the Communist Party of Finland supported Egypt's anti-colonialist struggle on the Suez Canal issue, and firmly supported Hungary's socialist cause and the Soviet Union's assistance to socialist Hungary on the Hungarian issue. We believe that the actions you have taken are fully in line with the principles of proletarian internationalism and have made a positive contribution to maintaining world peace and the cause of socialism.

Wang Shoudao said that there is a deep friendship between the Chinese people and the Finnish people. Our government and people cherish the friendship of the Finnish people and the Finnish government very much. We believe that this friendship and exchange will continue to be strengthened in the future.

Wang Shoudao said that the Chinese people, in the arduous task of building a backward agricultural country into a socialist industrial country, very much need to learn all kinds of experiences and knowledge from the people of all countries, especially the Soviet Union, and cherish the sympathy and support of fraternal parties, fraternal countries, and the people of all countries. Wang Shoudao expressed his sincere gratitude for the sympathy and support that the Communist Party of Finland has always given.

He said that the Chinese Communists, like the Communists in other countries, have always been your loyal comrades-in-arms in the struggle for peace, democracy, and socialism.

Finally, Wang Shoudao read out the congratulatory telegram from the CPC Central Committee. The full text of the congratulatory telegram is as follows: To the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Finland, and to all the delegates of the Eleventh Congress of the Communist Party of Finland, comrades:

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, on behalf of all members of the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people, extends fraternal and warm congratulations to your congress.

In the long and heroic struggle, the Communist Party of Finland has made significant efforts to protect the interests of the working people, to fight for democracy and socialism, and to defend world peace and the security of all peoples. The Communist Party of China and the Chinese people are deeply gratified by the achievements your party has made in this struggle. We firmly believe that the convening of this congress will make outstanding contributions to further strengthening the unity of your party, strengthening the unity of the Finnish working class and the national forces that love peace, democracy, and patriotism.

We wish the Communist Party of Finland and the Finnish people further achievements in the struggle for peace, democracy, and socialism.

We wish the congress a successful completion of its tasks.

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
