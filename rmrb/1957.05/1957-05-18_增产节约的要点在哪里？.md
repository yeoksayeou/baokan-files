    Increasing production and practicing economy are for building the country through diligence and thrift: this principle is very simple, and everyone understands it; however, when it comes to actual practice, it is not so simple, and it is easy to make mistakes. It is probably still necessary for everyone to sound a few more alarms.

    All construction must start from the 600 million population, from the general living standards and existing material conditions, so we should save wherever possible, and save what must be saved. However, diligence, thrift, and simplicity do not equal making do with whatever is available, because we are building a socialist country, we want to move forward, not stagnate, let alone regress; therefore, we must have a long-term vision, take care of the overall situation, and combine immediate interests with long-term interests. We must resolutely not save on what cannot be saved. Increasing production cannot lower quality; producing substandard goods will only increase the amount of defective products. Focusing on the present and forgetting the future, saving on small things and wasting on big things, is called losing big for small. It not only runs counter to the fundamental purpose of building the country through diligence and thrift, but is also naive and ridiculous. In a word, increasing production and practicing economy is a scientific problem, which requires careful calculation, repeated consideration, and listening to the opinions of the masses as well as the opinions of experts; we cannot just rely on a burst of enthusiasm and rush into it rashly. Increasing production and practicing economy in small places is often just a matter of common sense. As long as we use our brains more and think thoroughly about everything, we can avoid making mistakes, or even avoid making mistakes at all; but we must never blindly and one-sidedly pursue increasing production and practicing economy, let alone use egalitarianism in a swarm. This is the first point.

    Increasing production and practicing economy must prevent departmentalism. The more so in a planned and organized society, the more so in a period of national large-scale construction, the more there is a danger of one move affecting the whole situation. If any industrial product is blindly increased without regard to market needs, it will inevitably lead to a large backlog. Only caring about saving in one's own unit, regardless of whether other related units are saving or not, only caring about the savings of production and sales organizations, regardless of the waste of users, is selfish. If a family uses a daily necessity sparingly for one or two months, the increased expenditure is minimal and may not even be noticeable; but on a national scale, this waste is huge. Lowering costs and reducing pricing must maintain an appropriate ratio with the lifespan of manufactured goods in order to be truly economical; because accumulating wealth for the people of the whole country is true wealth accumulation. Therefore, increasing production and practicing economy cannot only calculate the accounts of one unit, one department, or one factory, but must calculate the overall account, the account of the people of the whole country. This is the second point.

    The third point, and also the most important point, is that the object of economy cannot be limited to materials, but must also include people. Labor creates wealth; who labors? People. Machines manufacture everything; who invents machines, manufactures machines, and uses machines? People. It is people who make production plans, people who actually produce, and people who manage production. To not start saving from people is to forget our greatest capital. The way to save people is simply to let everyone be in their proper place, make the best use of their talents, not hoard people, not bury people, and not have uneven labor, with some people being busy to death and others being idle to death. It is a waste to use a great talent for a small task, but it is even more dangerous to use a small talent for a great task. Whether it is the production department or the administrative department, using people improperly causes unimaginable losses to the country. For example, sending those who have no expertise, no education, and who need to be taken care of to the personnel department. The main task of the personnel department is to understand people and manage people, which is much more difficult than understanding and managing machines. It is the hub of all political work, and the responsibility is so great, how can people with limited talents shoulder it? As a result, the personnel department becomes like a sanatorium, like a nursing home, and also becomes a breeding ground for bureaucracy and a stumbling block for the unit. Can we blame them? Placed in the appropriate position, they can play a role, perhaps a very big role. On the other hand, if the personnel department is strengthened, not only will the small and large gears of various organs be more flexible, but the relationship between the Party and the masses and the unity work can also be done better, and the joke of "looking westward to Chang'an" will be insured not to happen.

    Furthermore, machines need regular maintenance, and people cannot just be used without rest and recuperation; even machines made of steel cannot bear too much burden, let alone people made of flesh and blood! In the stage of building the country through diligence and thrift, from engineers to workers, everyone is trying their best to extend the life of machines; why don't we cherish people in the same way, and think of ways to extend people's service years in the same way? Leading cadres are of course capable and work hard, especially in such a time of great change; but is it possible not to work until exhausted, until one is sick before one can rest? Is the method of killing the goose that lays the golden eggs in line with our long-term interests? To seek happiness for the next generation, and even for future generations, we rely entirely on the current generation to lay the foundation. Regardless of whether they are within or outside the Party, this generation of people is the first batch of capital for building the socialist cause; and this capital is not large, and the period of transition is still quite long, so we must use it sparingly. Physical and mental health, full of energy, and vigorous vitality are the basic conditions for improving production enthusiasm and increasing work efficiency. Regardless of the level of ability, as long as they are properly arranged and used rationally, everyone will consciously give play to their initiative, will have more rationalization proposals, will contribute more mass wisdom, and will have endless tricks for increasing production and practicing economy.

    The waste of materials is obvious. The waste of people is invisible, so it is more harmful and has a long-lasting impact. How can we only care about burning firewood and not care about protecting the green hills? The benefits of saving materials can be counted, but the benefits of saving people are endless, because people are the most basic working mother machine. This point does not seem to have received enough attention, I especially raise it for your consideration, hoping that leaders at all levels from the central government to the local governments will seriously consider it together.

### 增产节约的要点在哪里？

    增产节约的要点在哪里？	傅雷
    增产节约是为了勤俭建国：这道理粗浅得很，谁都懂得；一联系到实际可就不那末简单，很容易出偏差了。大家来多拉几声警报，恐怕还是必要的。
    一切建设要从六亿人口出发，要从一般的生活水平和现有的物质条件出发，所以可省则省，应省必省。但勤俭朴素并不等于因陋就简，因为我们是要建设一个社会主义国家，要前进，不是停滞，更不是后退；所以目光要放得远，要照顾全局，眼前利益必须与长远利益结合为一，不可省的坚决不省。增产不能降低质量，粗制滥造只能增加次货。顾了眼前，忘了将来，省了小的，浪费了大的，叫做因小失大，不但与勤俭建国的本旨背道而驰，而且幼稚可笑。一句话说完，增产节约是个科学问题，要经过精密的核算，反复的考虑，要听群众意见，也要听专家意见；不能单凭一股子热情，冒冒失失的去搞。小地方的增产节约往往只是常识问题，只要多用脑筋，前前后后，四面八方想个周到，就能少犯偏差，或竟不犯偏差；可决不能盲目片面的追求增产节约，更不能一窝蜂的用平均主义对待。此其一。
    增产节约要防止本位主义。越是在一个有计划有组织的社会里，越是在一个进行全国性大规模建设的时期，越是有牵一发而动全身的危险。任何工业品只管盲目增产，不问市场需要，势必造成大量积压。只管本单位节省，不管别的有关单位省不省，只管产销机构的节约，不管用户的浪费，这是自私自利。一个家庭一件日用品少用一、二个月，增加的支出为数甚微，也许感觉不到；但在全国范围内这笔浪费就大了。降低成本，减低定价，必须和制成品使用的寿命维持适当的比例，才是真正的节约；因为要为全国人民积累财富才是真正的积累财富。所以增产节约不能只算一个单位、一个部门、一个工厂的账，而要算总账，算全国人民的账。此其二。
    第三点，也是最重要的一点是：节约的对象不能只限于物资，还要包括人。劳动创造财富；谁劳动？人。机器制造一切；谁发明机器，制造机器，使用机器？人。作生产计划的是人，实际生产的是人，管理生产的还是人。要不从人节约起，就是忘记了我们最大的资本。节约人的办法无非是各得其所，各尽其用，不积压人，不埋没人，不要劳逸不均，忙的忙死，闲的闲死。大材小用固然是浪费，小材大用更其危险。生产部门也好，行政部门也好，用人不当对国家的损失是不堪设想的。例如把没有专长的，没有文化水平的，无处安排而必须照顾的都往人事处送。人事处主要是了解人，管理人，那比了解机器管理机器不知要难多少倍，那是一切政治工作的枢纽，责任何等重大，岂是小材大用的人所能担负？结果是人事处像休养所，像养老院，又成为官僚主义的温床，本单位的绊脚石。这能怪他们吗？放在适当的岗位上，他们是能够起作用的，也许还是很大的作用呢。另一方面，人事处阵容加强了，不但各机关的大小齿轮更灵活，便是党群关系，团结工作也可做得更好，而“西望长安”那样的笑话也保险不会发生。
    再说，机器需要定期检修，人也不能只使用，不休整；连钢铁制成的机器都不能负担过重，何况是血肉做的人！在勤俭建国的阶段，从工程师到工人，都在千方百计的想法延长机器的寿命；为什么我们不同样的爱惜人，不同样的想办法延长人的服务年龄？领导干部固然是能者多劳，特别在这样一个大变动的时代里；但是否可以不要劳动到筋疲力尽，直要病倒了才能有休息呢？近于杀鸡取卵的办法是否合乎我们的长远利益呢？要为下一代，甚至以后的世世代代谋幸福，全靠现在这一代打基础。不管党内党外，这一代的人都是建设社会主义事业的第一批资本；而这资本不大，青黄不接的时期还相当长，要用得俭省一点才行哩。身心康健，精神饱满，生气蓬勃，是提高生产热情，增进工作效率的基本条件。不论水平高低，能力大小，只要安排得当，使用合理，大家会自觉的发挥积极性，会有更多的合理化建议，会贡献出更多的群众智慧，也就会有无穷无尽的增产节约的窍门。
    物资的浪费有目共睹。用人的浪费看不见，所以为害更大，而且影响久远。我们怎么能只管烧柴，不去养护青山呢？节约物资的好处数得清，节约人的好处说不尽，因为人是最基本的工作母机。这一点似乎还不曾受到充分的注意，我特别提出来，希望从中央到地方的各级领导一起来郑重考虑。
