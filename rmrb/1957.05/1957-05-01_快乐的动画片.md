Typesetters typesetting in the composing room, miners mining in the mines.
You mine lead type,
Giving us the food of wisdom and light.
Typesetters picking up characters,
Sharp eyes and quick hands without stopping.
One character, one character, one character,
Oh, "Plant one grain of millet in the spring, reap ten thousand seeds in the autumn!"
Typesetters in the composing room,
You bring me so much good fantasy:
The type case is like the mountains of Yan'an,
You typesetting, like lighting the cave dwellings one by one.
The type case is like the buildings of the city,
You typesetting, like thousands of windows and households with swallows flying.

To a residents' committee member
There is white frost on your hair,
The wrinkles on your forehead are like the growth rings of old trees.
The old society bound your feet into half-crippled,
Now you run around, busy for the neighborhood work.
In the morning, you notify me to hold a voters' meeting,
On the street you post red-bottomed, gold-lettered voter lists.
You check the cleanliness of the front and back yards,
And mobilize every household to save food.
You run the street nursery in a small hall,
Telling stories to the children of the neighbors.
"Give me your children,
Don't let the children be like foot-binding cloth缠绕缠在你脚上."
In that small classroom with low benches and small tables,
Filled with old men and old women,
You wear old spectacles and take the lead in learning culture,
You say: "The Communist Party brightens the eyes of the blind!"
That day, I was busy working in the office,
The voice from the telephone was yours:
"Your child is sick! Don't panic,
I have already sent him to the hospital bed."
Oh, old woman, old woman,
The old society hid you in the dark well,
Not seeing the sun for decades, unable to exert strength.
Now the spring breeze is blowing, and hundreds of flowers are blooming,
May happiness accompany you, as high as the mountains and as long as the flowing water!

    快乐的动画片
    邹荻帆
    排字工人在排字房排字工人在排字房，矿工开矿在矿场。你开采的是铅字矿，给我们智慧的食粮和亮光。排字工人捡着字，眼尖手快不停息。一粒字，一粒字，一粒字，哦，“春种一粒粟，秋收万颗子”！排字工人在排字房，你带给我好多的好幻想：排字架像延安的山，你排字，像把窑洞灯火一一点亮。排字架像城市的楼，你排字，像千窗万户有燕子飞翔。
    给一个居民委员你的头发上有了岁月的白霜，额上的皱纹和老树的年轮一样。旧社会把你的双脚裹成半残废，如今奔走着，为街道工作忙。早晨、你通知我开选民会，大街上你张贴红底金字的选民榜。前院后院你查清洁，又动员家家户户节约食粮。你把街道托儿站办在小厅堂，对左邻右舍的孩子把故事讲。“把你们的孩子都给我吧，别让孩子像裹脚布缠在你脚上。”就在那矮凳、小桌的小课堂，坐满了老公公、老大娘，你戴着老光眼镜带头学文化，你说：“共产党把瞎子眼变亮！”那一天、我在机关工作忙，电话机里是你的声响：
  “你的孩子病了！不必慌，我已经把他送到医院的病床上。”哦，老大娘，老大娘，旧社会把你向黑窟窿的古井里藏，几十年见不到太阳，使不出力量。现在春风吹拂，百花放，愿幸福伴随你，山高水流长！
