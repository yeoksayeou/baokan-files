Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 21st. 120,000 people in Hanoi gathered today at Ba Dinh Square to welcome Chairman Voroshilov.

This central square of Hanoi was decorated with particular beauty today. The entire venue was filled with the national flags of the Soviet Union and Vietnam.

At 6:30 this morning, Chairman Ho Chi Minh accompanied Chairman Voroshilov from the Presidential Palace to Ba Dinh Square. When they appeared on the rostrum, the crowd waved small flags and bouquets, cheering them for a long time.

After Tran Duy Hung, Chairman of the Hanoi Municipal Administrative Committee, delivered a speech on behalf of the people of the Vietnamese capital to welcome the distinguished Soviet guests, Chairman Voroshilov addressed the assembly.

Voroshilov extended his greetings to the heroic Vietnamese people and praised the achievements of the Vietnamese people under the leadership of the Vietnam Workers' Party and Chairman Ho Chi Minh in winning the war of resistance and restoring the economy. Chairman Voroshilov condemned the South Vietnamese regime for establishing a new system of oppression against workers and peasants in South Vietnam, persecuting former resistance personnel and those who demanded national unification. He pointed out that these policies of South Vietnam were aimed at undermining the Geneva Accords and realizing the US imperialists' conspiracy to invade Vietnam and other countries in Indochina. South Vietnam's policies not only threaten the peace of Vietnam but also directly threaten the peace of Southeast Asia.

Speaking of the current international situation, Voroshilov pointed out that the friendship and cooperation between the Soviet Union and socialist countries is a strong guarantee of world peace. He particularly emphasized the role of China as one of the world's major powers in international affairs. He said, "Without China's participation, major issues in the world, especially in Asia and the Far East, cannot be resolved."

Chairman Voroshilov concluded by shouting in Vietnamese, "Long live Vietnam!" "Long live the Soviet Union!" The crowd responded with warm cheers.

Chairman Ho Chi Minh then said to the assembled crowd, "I will tell you a secret, Chairman Voroshilov is a great-great-grandfather, his son already has a grandson. Two days ago, Chairman Voroshilov sent me a telegram from a plane at an altitude of 10,000 meters to wish me a happy birthday. He is 76 years old this year, and I am only 67 years old. I suggest everyone call him Grandpa." At this moment, the atmosphere in the venue was unprecedentedly lively, and applause thundered. At the end of his speech, Chairman Ho Chi Minh shouted slogans such as "Long live the brotherly friendship between Vietnam and the Soviet Union!" "Long live Grandpa Voroshilov!" and so on. He also led everyone in singing the song "Unity is Strength."

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 21st. Chairman Ho Chi Minh held a grand state banquet on the evening of May 20th to entertain Chairman Voroshilov and his party.

The banquet was held in the beautiful back garden of the Presidential Palace. More than 350 people attended last night's state banquet, including Ton Duc Thang, Phan Ke Toai, Vo Nguyen Giap, Truong Chinh, Hoang Quoc Viet, Bui Ky, and other senior leaders of the Vietnamese party, government, and military, as well as foreign envoys and foreign guests.

    河内人民集会欢迎国宾
    伏老谴责南越威胁东南亚和平
    胡志明主席举行国宴招待伏老
    据新华社河内21日电　河内十二万人民今天在巴亭广场集会，欢迎伏罗希洛夫主席。
    河内的这个中心广场今天装饰得特别美丽。全场挂满了苏越两国国旗。
    清晨六时三十分，胡志明主席陪着伏罗希洛夫主席从主席府来到巴亭广场。当他们在主席台上出现的时候，全场群众挥舞着小旗和花束，向他们长时间欢呼。
    在河内市行政委员会主席陈维兴代表越南首都人民致词欢迎苏联贵宾以后，伏罗希洛夫主席向大会讲话。
    伏罗希洛夫向英雄的越南人民致意，并且对越南人民在越南劳动党和胡志明主席领导下取得抗战胜利和经济恢复的成就表示赞扬。伏罗希洛夫主席谴责南越政权在南越建立新的压迫工农群众的制度，迫害前抗战人员和要求国家统一的人们。他指出，南越的这些政策是为了破坏日内瓦协议和实现美帝国主义对越南和印度支那其他国家进行侵略阴谋。南越的政策不仅威胁到越南的和平，而且直接威胁到东南亚的和平。
    在谈到目前国际局势的时候，伏罗希洛夫指出，苏联和社会主义各国的友谊和合作是世界和平的坚强保证。他特别强调中国作为世界大国之一在国际事务中的作用。他说，“如果没有中国参加，就不能解决世界上尤其是亚洲和远东的重大问题。”
      伏罗希洛夫主席最后用越南话高呼“越南万岁！”“苏联万岁！”群众对他报以热烈欢呼。
      胡志明主席接着向到会的群众说，我告诉你们一个秘密，伏罗希洛夫主席是四世同堂，他的儿子已经有了孙子。两天前，伏罗希洛夫主席从一万公尺高空的飞机上打电报向我祝寿。他今年七十六岁，我才六十七岁，我建议大家喊他老爷爷。这时，会场空气空前活跃，掌声雷动。胡志明主席在结束讲话时高呼“越苏两国兄弟般的友谊万岁！”“伏罗希洛夫老爷爷万岁！”等口号。他还领导大家唱“团结就是力量”歌曲。
    据新华社河内21日电　胡志明主席在5月20日晚上举行盛大的国宴招待伏罗希洛夫主席一行。
    宴会设在优美的主席府后花园里。参加昨晚国宴的有孙德胜、潘继遂、武元甲、长征、黄国越、裴纪和越南党政军其他高级领袖、外国使节和外宾等共三百五十多人。
