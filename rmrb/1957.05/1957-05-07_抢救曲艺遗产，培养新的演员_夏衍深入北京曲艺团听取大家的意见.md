    Rescuing Quyi Heritage, Cultivating New Performers
    Xia Yan Listens to Opinions Deeply at the Beijing Quyi Troupe
    (Our Newspaper) News. "This is the first time since liberation that leaders of the cultural departments have personally come to our troupe." This is what Wei Xikui, a major performer of the Beijing Quyi Troupe, said first when Xia Yan, Vice Minister of Culture, arrived at the troupe on the afternoon of May 6.
    Since 1949, the main members of the Beijing Quyi Troupe have been working hard for the new Quyi cause. They have gone deep into factories, deep into the countryside, deep into the army, to Korea, and to Kangzang, adhering to serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, and have been welcomed by the vast audience. However, they have not received the due care and cultivation from the cultural departments. Wei Changlin said, "Initially, because we were promoting, broadcasting, and performing various new programs, each person could only get two or three mao in five days. We were not afraid of difficulties and persisted, in order to seek progress and let Quyi stand up and serve the people." Guan Xuezeng said, "Quyi performances used to be a variety of ten different skills, including speaking, singing, changing faces, and practicing martial arts, which was very complete. However, in recent years, one by one, those of us who engaged in acrobatics were 'drawn' away by state-run theater troupes, leaving us half-paralyzed, not as rich as in the past." In recent years, the Beijing Opera, which reflects modern life, has gradually gained a large number of audiences. Wu Changbao believes that they need new scripts, but no one writes them. They want to seek some necessary development in music, but no experts help them. No one helps them to dig out and organize the things they have in their hearts. Wei Xikui said more excitedly, "Our new Beijing Opera has been going on for seven or eight years, and now some people in the cultural departments still doubt whether it can continue to exist. I don't understand. Take 'Yang Naiwu and Xiao Baicai' for example, it has been performed more than one hundred times, with more than one hundred thousand audience members. Doesn't that show the people's love? If such a genre is not needed, how can we follow the mass line?" She continued, "We know that we should rely on our own efforts, but we also need the support of the government. The masses now love us and also require us to continuously improve in art. This cannot be done by our own strength alone. If the government takes some of the money wasted by certain state-run theater troupes to help us, that would be enough. Now, state-run theater troupes only learn but do not practice, while we only practice but cannot learn. Even when we get sick, we don't even have public medical care."
    How to rescue the Quyi heritage and cultivate the next generation is one of the most important issues in the Quyi circle. Cao Baolu said, "My master is seventy-nine years old and now lives by setting up a small stall on the side of the road. He has a wealth of skills worth learning from." He also said, "There were originally ten elders in the Beijing Quyi circle, now there are only eight left, all in their seventies and eighties. If we don't extract something from them, it will be over. In addition, some old artists have concerns because their lives are not guaranteed and dare not teach their skills to others. These all need the government to find a way to arrange as soon as possible." Gu Rongfu also said that in Quyi, it takes at least six years to cultivate an apprentice. Now they can't even take care of their own lives, how can they support apprentices?
    After listening to everyone's opinions, Xia Yan said that the main reason for these problems is that the leaders and cadres of the cultural departments still have more or less: the idea of valuing public over private, valuing the big over the small; and not paying enough attention to the Quyi work that is most loved by the working people. In the future, we will continue to listen to everyone's opinions, seek truth from facts to solve their current difficulties, and express opinions on preserving the Quyi tradition, cultivating the next generation, and improving the lives of artists.

### 抢救曲艺遗产，培养新的演员  夏衍深入北京曲艺团听取大家的意见

    抢救曲艺遗产，培养新的演员
    夏衍深入北京曲艺团听取大家的意见
    本报讯　“文化部门的领导同志亲身到我们团里来，这还是解放以来的头一次”。这是5月6日下午，文化部夏衍副部长到北京曲艺团时，该团主要演员魏喜奎首先说的话。
    北京曲艺团的主要成员从1949年以来，一直为新曲艺事业艰苦地工作，他们深入工厂，深入农村，深入部队，赴朝鲜，赴康藏，坚持为工农兵服务，受到了广大观众的欢迎；可是他们却没有受到文化部门应有的关心和培植。魏长林说：“最初，我们因为宣传、播音，演唱各种新节目，每个人五天只能分到两、三毛钱，我们不怕困难，一直坚持下来，为的是求进步，让曲艺也站起来为人民服务。”关学曾说：“曲艺演出原是十样杂耍，说、唱、变、练，样样都有，本来是很完整的；可是近年来，我们中间搞杂耍的一个个的被国营剧团‘抽签’抽走了，现在落得个半身不遂，不像过去那样丰富了。”这几年来，反映现代生活的曲剧渐渐拥有自己的大批观众，吴长宝认为他们需要新剧本没有人写，音乐上想求得一些必需的发展没有专家帮助。他们自己心里有的东西没有人帮助挖掘整理。魏喜奎更激动地说：“我们的新曲剧已经搞了七、八年，而现在文化部门还有人怀疑能不能存在下去。我不懂，就拿‘杨乃武与小白菜’来说，演了一百多场，有十几万观众，难道还不能说明群众的喜爱？如果这样的剧种不需要，怎样才是走群众路线呢？”她接着又说：“我们知道应该自力更生，但是也需要政府的扶植。群众现在喜爱我们，也要求我们在艺术上不断的提高；这光靠我们自己的力量是办不到的。如果政府把某些国营剧团所浪费的钱拿来帮助我们，就够好了。现在，国营剧团尽学习不实践，我们却是尽实践不能学习。甚至生了病，连个公费医疗也没有。”
    如何抢救曲艺遗产和培养后一代是目前曲艺界最重要的问题之一。曹宝禄说：“我的师傅七十九岁了，如今靠在马路边上摆小摊过活。他满身本领值得我们学。”他又说：“我们北京曲艺界原有十老，现在只剩下八老，都是七、八十岁的人了，再不从他们身上摘下些东西就完了。另外，有的老艺人因为生活没有保障，还有顾虑，不敢把自己的本领教给别人。这些都需要政府赶快设法安排。”顾荣甫也说，在曲艺方面要培养一个徒弟，没有六年立不起来。现在他们自己的生活还顾不了，怎么能养活徒弟？
    在听取了大家的意见后，夏衍说，产生这些问题的主要原因，是文化部门的领导和干部或多或少都还存在着：重公轻私、重大轻小的思想；对最为劳动人民所喜爱的曲艺工作重视不够。今后还要继续听取大家的意见，实事求是地来解决他们的当前困难，并对保存曲艺传统、培养后一代和改善艺人生活等问题发表了意见。
