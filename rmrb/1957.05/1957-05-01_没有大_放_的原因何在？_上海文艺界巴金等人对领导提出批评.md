What are the Reasons for Not "Blooming" Fully?
Shanghai Literary and Art Circles, Including Ba Jin, Criticize Leaders

(Our Newspaper Dispatch) Shanghai writers recently gathered together to discuss the question of "how to 'bloom' fully."

Shanghai's writers are a strong force, second only to Beijing in the country. Since the principle of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" was put forward, although the situation in Shanghai's literary and art circles has improved somewhat, the overall situation is that it has not "bloomed" fully.

Where is the problem? There are mainly two reasons: one is the bureaucratic style of leadership in creation, and the other is the need for a broad garden to "bloom" fully. The literary and art leaders have done work in taking care of the writers' lives. However, no one has studied how works are produced or how works are viewed. Shanghai has a tradition of drama, has the best actors in the country, and drama is a very good tool for conducting socialist education. However, scripts cannot be published, and there are very few places for dramas to be performed. The number of drama theaters compared to Yue opera, local opera, and Shanghai opera theaters is one to forty or fifty. The leadership has not paid attention to this abnormal situation.

If it were simply a matter of not paying attention, the problem would be simpler. However, sometimes the control is too strict and inappropriate. The main manifestation is more criticism and less encouragement. Many writers feel pressure from criticism. Ba Jin's essay "Eat Whatever is Available" was criticized. Jin Yi also caused a stir with a short article of five hundred words. Xu Jie talked about the reasons why he wrote less after liberation. He listed the poems, novels, and Lu Xun studies he had written, almost all of which were criticized. Therefore, he became timid when he started writing. Anyway, writing less is not wrong, and being criticized for mistakes is not comfortable. The problem is not just fear of making mistakes or fear of being criticized. Just criticism is always a driving force for a writer. The problem is that much of the criticism is not convincing. Ba Jin cited an incident to illustrate that the leadership does not consult with writers on creative issues. His novel "Family" was adapted into a film, and there were some places he did not agree with. When he was called to see it, he made suggestions, but it was too late to change them. The Shanghai Writers Association should manage creation, but it has done many things that general organs do, leaving its own affairs aside. Many writers who are responsible for work do not have a writing life. Readers have many demands, but writers do not have time to write, and they are very distressed. This year, writers will rely on royalties for their livelihood, which is an even bigger problem. Jin Yi, as the vice chairman of the Shanghai Writers Association, used his many years of experience to talk about what kind of leadership writers need. He said: Leading writers is a difficult task! Too much interference makes writers nervous; not enough interference makes writers say they are not cared for. Jin Yi said: In the past, going to meetings in the central government was always very exciting, but after returning, many things could not be done, and the enthusiasm slowly cooled down. How should writers be led? He proposed five "mores": more management, more concern, more criticism, more listening to everyone's opinions, and more understanding of the characteristics of literary and artistic work.

How can exotic flowers and rare herbs bloom without a broad garden? Flowers should "bloom" in a hundred, but publishing houses only allow one flower to bloom. The Shanghai New Literature and Art Publishing House was formed by the merger of the original five publishing houses. It publishes more than 500 kinds of books a year, which is about the same as the number of varieties published by the People's Literature Publishing House in Beijing. However, the People's Literature Publishing House has 100,000 tons of paper throughout the year, while the New Literature and Art Publishing House only has 33,000 tons of paper, and it has only recently increased by 1,000 tons. The current chaos in the publishing industry is inseparable from the bureaucracy of the Central Publishing Bureau. Fu Lei and Ba Jin both said that many of the regulations and systems in publishing work are too rigid and do not conform to the actual situation. Regardless of the quality of reprinted books or the needs of readers, they are all handled in accordance with the regulations, and many books cannot be published. We want to learn from Lu Xun, but we cannot buy Lu Xun's books. Fu Lei's translation of "Jean-Christophe" and some of Ba Jin's works have been out of print for more than a year. An even more noteworthy issue is that book publishing is based on movements. During the high tide of agricultural collectivization, there were so many books about agricultural collectivization that it was incredible. After the craze passed, the books piled up, some accumulating millions of copies. Ba Jin said that he felt very sad when he inspected publishing work and saw piles of unsold books. He said: This cannot be blamed solely on the comrades who do practical work below! Luo Ji-nan said: There should be more varieties of published books and fewer copies printed. We must follow the mass line more and not let a few people decide. Luo Ji-nan believes that many of the reference books, scientific and technical books, and classical works published by Zhonghua Book Company and Commercial Press in the past were good. Even if some were not good, they could be revised, reorganized, and published without having to start from scratch. The labor of predecessors should be respected.

In addition, Fu Lei also mentioned that the unreasonable royalty system affects creation and the lives of writers, and he hopes that the relevant central departments will resolve it as soon as possible.

### 没有大“放”的原因何在？  上海文艺界巴金等人对领导提出批评

    没有大“放”的原因何在？
    上海文艺界巴金等人对领导提出批评
    本报讯  上海作家们最近围坐一堂，座谈“怎样大‘放’”问题。
    上海作家的队伍是强大的，从全国来说，仅次于北京。在“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针提出以后，上海文艺界的状况虽然有所进展，但总的情况，是没有大“放”起来。
    问题在哪里呢？主要是两个原因：一是创作领导上的官僚主义，二是需要大“放”的广阔的园地。文艺领导对作家生活的照顾，是做了工作的。但是，对于作品怎样产生，对作品怎样看法，却没有人研究。上海有话剧传统，有全国最好的演员，话剧又是进行社会主义教育的很好的工具，但是，剧本不能出版，话剧上演的场所又很少。话剧剧场与越剧、地方剧和滑稽剧的剧场相比，是一比四、五十。对这样的不正常情况，一直没有引起领导上的重视。
    如果仅仅是不管，问题还简单一些，可是，有时管得过严，又不恰当。主要表现是批评多，鼓励少。许多作家都对批评感到压力。巴金写了“有啥吃啥”的杂文，遭到了批评。靳以为了一篇五百字的短文，也引起了风波。许杰谈到他解放后写东西少的原因，他列举了所写的诗、小说和鲁迅研究，几乎都挨了批评。因此，他写起东西来就胆小了。反正少写一点没有错，错了挨批评不大舒服。问题还不在怕错、怕挨批评。正当的批评对于一个作家永远是一个推动的力量。问题是许多批评，使人心里不服。巴金举了一件事，说明领导上对创作问题，是不大同作家研究的。他的小说“家”改成电影，有一些地方，他是不同意的，等把他叫去看的时候，他提了意见，也没法改了。上海作家协会应当管创作，却做了许多一般机关所做的事，把本身的事丢在一边。许多担负工作的作家，没有写作生活。读者要求很多，没有时间写作，作家心里很苦恼。今年开始作家要靠稿费生活，这更是个大问题。靳以是上海作家协会的副主席，他以自己多年的体会，谈出作家需要怎样的领导。他说：领导作家是一件难事！多过问，作家紧张；不过问，作家又说不关心。靳以说：过去到中央开会，总是很兴奋，回来以后，许多事情办不通，热情就慢慢冷下来了。究竟怎样领导作家呢？他提出五多：多管、多关心、多批评、多听取大家意见、多了解文艺工作的特点。
    要放出奇花异朵来，没有广阔的园地怎行呢？花是要百花齐“放”，但是，出版社却是一花独放。上海新文艺出版社是由原来的五家出版社合并成的。一年出五百多种书，这个数目同北京人民文学出版社的种类差不多，可是，人民文学出版社全年有十万吨纸，新文艺出版社只是三万三千吨纸，最近才增加了一千吨。目前出版界的混乱现象，是与中央出版局的官僚主义分不开的。傅雷、巴金都说：出版工作的许多章程制度，都是太死太板，不符合实际情况。重版的书，不管质量如何，也不管读者需要，一律按照章程办事，很多书就出不来。我们要学习鲁迅，可是买不到鲁迅的书。傅雷译的约翰克利斯朵夫、巴金的一些作品，都脱销了一年以上。更值得注意的一个问题，就是出版书根据运动办事。农业合作化高潮，有关农业合作化的书多得了不得，一阵风过去了，书积压起来了，有的积压过几百万册。巴金说他视察出版工作时，看见成堆卖不出的书，心里很难过。他说：这不能光指责下面做实际工作的同志啊！罗稷南说：出版的书品种要多些，印数要少些。要多走群众路线，不要由几个人决定。罗稷南认为中华书局和商务印书馆过去出版的工具书、科学技术书和古典著作，有很多是好的，即使有些不好，也可修改整理出版，不必要重新做起。前人的劳动，是应当尊重的。
    此外，傅雷还提到了稿费制度不合理，影响创作，也影响作家生活，希望中央有关部门尽快解决。
