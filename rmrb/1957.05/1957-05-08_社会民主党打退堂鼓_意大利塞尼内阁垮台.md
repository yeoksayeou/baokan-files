    Social Democratic Party Backs Down
    Italian Segni Cabinet Collapses

    (Dispatch from our newspaper in Rome) The Segni cabinet, which had been in power for twenty-two months, resigned on the evening of May 6th. After resigning, the Segni government will temporarily maintain the situation as a "caretaker government."

    The resignation of the Segni government was triggered by the decision of Social Democratic Party leader Saragat, who served as Deputy Prime Minister, on May 5th for the Social Democratic Party to withdraw from the government.

    For a long time, the Segni government has been facing a crisis. In mid-February, when discussing the appointment of the new Minister of the newly established State Investment Department, the various parties in the Italian Parliament launched a fierce struggle. Because the government appointed a fascist, Togni, as Minister, the Republican Party, which participated in the government coalition, withdrew its support for the government, so that Segni's three-party coalition government could only maintain a majority of one vote in Parliament, facing a precarious situation. After the Social Democratic Party also withdrew from the government, the Segni government lost its majority in Parliament and had to resign.

    According to Reuters, the collapse of the Segni government also reflected the increasingly sharp divisions between the Christian Democratic Party, the Social Democratic Party, and the Liberal Party within the government before the general election. Many Christian Democratic representatives were dissatisfied with the Liberal Party's Foreign Minister Martino because he supported the Anglo-French aggression against Egypt. They believe that Italy should be more closely aligned with the United States, and at the same time, Italy should not relax the opportunity to play an increasingly important role in Near East affairs.

    According to Western news agencies, officials at the U.S. State Department are "closely monitoring" the development of the situation in Italy. They hope that the new Italian government will be a "pro-Western regime."

### 社会民主党打退堂鼓  意大利塞尼内阁垮台

    社会民主党打退堂鼓
    意大利塞尼内阁垮台
    本报讯　罗马消息：当政二十二个月的塞尼内阁已在6日晚上辞职。辞职后的塞尼政府将以“看守政府”身分暂时维持局面。
    塞尼政府的辞职是由于担任副总理的社会民主党领袖萨拉盖特5月5日决定社会民主党退出政府而引起的。
    很久以来，塞尼政府就面临着危机。2月中在讨论任命新成立的国家投资部部长的时候，意大利议会中的各个党派展开了激烈的斗争。由于政府任命一个法西斯分子托格尼为部长，于是参加政府联盟的共和党就撤回了对政府的支持，从而使塞尼的三党联合政府在议会中只能维持一票的多数，面临着风雨飘摇的危境。在社会民主党也退出政府后，塞尼政府就丧失掉议会的多数，因而不得不提出辞职。
    据路透社报道，塞尼政府的垮台还反映了政府内部的天主教民主党、社会民主党和自由党在大选前日益尖锐的分歧。许多天主教民主党代表人物不满自由党人的外交部长马蒂诺。因为他支持了英法对埃及的侵略。他们认为，意大利应当更密切地同美国一致，同时意大利不应该放松在近东事务中起越来越大的作用的机会。
    据西方通讯社报道，美国国务院的官员们正在“密切注意”意大利事态的发展。他们希望，新的意大利政府将是“亲西方的政权”。
