    Reflections on the Fate of "Young Drummer"
              Chen Bochui

    After seeing the film "Young Drummer," as I walked out of the cinema, the tension caused by the thrilling plot hadn't subsided, and I couldn't stop thinking about the fate of the young protagonist, Seryozha. In fact, the ending of the film made it very clear: Seryozha was reunited with his father and they sang army songs together happily. However, because he is a young boy, a Young Pioneer, and a Young Pioneer drummer, the concern for him becomes even more profound.
    The film "Young Drummer" is adapted from the novel "The Fate of a Drummer." Like other excellent works by Gaidar, it always focuses on the lives of children and adolescents. The real situation of social history is not only the background of the work's description, but also the profound content of the work—closely combining the Soviet people's vigilance against hidden enemies and their enthusiasm for defending the socialist motherland with various specific educational issues for the next generation. Lofty patriotism permeates the entire work. This is the high expression of the ideological and artistic nature of Gaidar's works, and it is also a model of socialist realist children's literature.
    Seryozha's happy childhood was suddenly shattered. The lack of care and discipline gradually led him to the brink of a dangerous cliff of depravity. This was clearly due to the influence of the lives of adults. As events developed, he encountered a series of unusual events that were not easily encountered by an ordinary teenager. Finally, the unraveling of this complex and terrible knot of life led the young drummer, who had fallen into a tragic fate, from a treacherous and dark path to a bright and broad road, still closely related to the development of major events in the lives of adults.
    Audiences can clearly see in the film: the adult life has an invisible but close chain reaction to children and adolescents, and has a huge impact, the consequences of which are by no means lightly dismissed.
   “You reap what you sow.” This correct and wise metaphor is precisely the motto that adults must follow as an example in children's education.
    Fortunately, Seryozha grew up in the new society after the October Revolution in the motherland. The country, the Party, and the broad masses of the people are always concerned about the successors to the great cause of communist construction. Although unexpected events happened and his family became "anarchic," the school counselor repeatedly sought him out to go to summer camp. The old man who swept the yard in the apartment advised him: "You have to be careful, that bad kid won't do anything good." His father's old comrade-in-arms, Polovtsev, cared about him; the engineer Grachikovski cared about him; the National Public Security Bureau personnel cared about him. … His fate did not fall to the most tragic situation.
    But we can imagine: if this clever, brave and lovable boy had grown up in the old society, his future would undoubtedly have been ruined. It was the misfortune imposed on the children by the defects of the family that was saved by the superior socialist system. However, this is a major matter that is worthy of deep thought and close attention in the family and in society.
    At present, in our country, some individual parents, intentionally or unintentionally, also neglect such a major matter. They think: "In the new society, children cannot be spoiled." This is true. But we must never relax the responsibility of parents in the education of their children, and push all educational work to schools and teachers. This is an irresponsible idea and behavior.
    Parents should understand the importance of family education. It is a major component of out-of-school education and an important educational base. On the other hand, they should also understand that family education has its own characteristics. The natural love between parents and children, the intimate relationship of living together day and night, means that parents' words and deeds, their every move, will have a profound, strong, and subtle influence on the plasticity of the pure minds of children and adolescents, like a blank sheet of paper. This power is astonishing, but it is an ironclad fact. Wise parents should give full play to the characteristics of family education to closely cooperate with school education to form a perfect educational network, in order to carry out education and do a better job of children's education, and cultivate talents for the country.
    The writer prefaced the film with these two warnings: "This novel does not describe war, but the severity and horror of the events it narrates are in no way inferior to war."
    Thanks to this outstanding genius warrior and writer, he also rings a loud educational alarm bell to parents all over the world. "Young Drummer" should not only be seen as a children's story film of literary art, but also as an educational film with educational significance for children.

    从“少年鼓手”的命运想起
              陈伯吹
    看过影片“少年鼓手”，从电影院里走出来以后，不仅为惊心动魄的情节所引起的紧张没得到松弛，也还念念不忘于小主人公谢略沙的命运。其实，影片的结局表白得很清楚：谢略沙和他爸爸重逢了，而且以欢欣的心情一同唱着军歌。但是，因为他是个少年，是个少先队员，又是个少先队的鼓手，对他的关怀就不觉来得更加深切了。
    电影“少年鼓手”是根据“鼓手的命运”的小说改编的。它和盖达尔的其他优秀作品一样，总是以少年儿童的生活为题材的中心，社会历史的真实情况不只是作品描写的背景，而且是作品深刻的内容——以苏维埃人民对于暗藏的敌人的警惕，和保卫社会主义祖国的热情，跟对下一代的种种具体的教养问题相密切结合。崇高的爱国主义精神渗透在整个作品里。这是盖达尔作品的思想性和艺术性的高度表现；也是社会主义现实主义创作的儿童文学作品的典范。
    谢略沙的少年时代的幸福生活，忽然地给破碎了，随着那种没有爱护的、没有管教的生活逐渐放任他走向堕落的危险的悬崖边上，这显然是受到了成年人生活的影响所致。以后事件一直发展开去，他遭遇到了为一个寻常的少年所不容易遭遇到的不寻常的一系列事件，而最后这复杂的可怕的生活结纽的解开，使这个沦于可悲的命运的少年鼓手，从险恶的阴暗的小路上，一下子进入康庄的光明大道，仍然是和成年人生活上的重大事件的发展相关联着的。
    观众可以清晰地在影片里看出来：成年人的生活无形中对于少年儿童起着多么密切的连锁反应，而发生着巨大的影响，这后果绝不是轻描淡写的。
   “种瓜得瓜，种豆得豆”。这个正确的智慧的譬喻，也正是成年人在儿童教育上必须以身作则地起示范作用的格言。
    谢略沙幸而成长在祖国十月革命以后的新社会里，国家和党以及广大的人民，时刻关怀着伟大的共产主义建设事业的未来的接班人。虽然平地起风波，使他的家庭成为“无政府状态”。然而学校里的辅导员一再来找他到夏令营去。公寓里打扫院子的老头儿劝告他：“你可要小心，那个坏小子不会干出好事来。”父亲的老战友波洛甫采夫关心他；工程师格拉奇阔夫斯基关心他；国家民警局人员关心他。……他的命运才没有落到最悲惨的境地里去。
    但是我们可以设想：这个聪明勇敢的可爱的少年，如果成长在旧社会里，他的前途无可怀疑地会被毁了。正是家庭的缺陷所造成的、加在子女身上的不幸，给社会主义的优越的社会制度挽救了。然而这是值得令人猛省、深切注意、是家庭里的、也是社会上的一件大事情。
    在目前，我们国家里，个别的部分的家长，也有意无意地忽视了这样的一件大事情。他们认为：“在新社会里，孩子们坏不了。”这是不错的。但决不能因此就放松了做父母对子女教养方面的责任，把全部的教育工作推给学校和老师，这是不负责任的思想和行为。
    父母应该理解家庭教育的重要性。它是校外教育的一个主要组成部分，同时是个重要的教育据点。另一方面还应该理解家庭教育有它的特点，父母子女间的天性的自然的亲子之爱，朝于斯、夕于斯地亲密的生活关系，因而父母平时的一言一语、一举一动，在少年儿童白纸般纯洁的身心的可塑性的基础上，会起着深刻的强烈的潜移默化的作用。这势力是可惊的，然而是钢铁般的事实。贤明的父母正应该发挥家庭教育的特点，来紧密地配合学校教育而构成一个完美的教育网，以便于进行教育，更好地搞好儿童教育工作，为国家培养人才。
    作家在影片前面题着这么两句警语：“这部小说不是描写战争的，但是它所叙述的事件底严酷和可怕丝毫不亚于战争。”
    感谢这位杰出的天才的战士和作家，他也对天下父母们敲着响亮的教育的警钟。“少年鼓手”不仅作为文学艺术的儿童故事片来看，更应该作为富有教育意义的儿童教育片来看。
