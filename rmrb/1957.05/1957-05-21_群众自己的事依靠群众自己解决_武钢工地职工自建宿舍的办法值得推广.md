    Rely on the Masses to Solve Their Own Problems:
    The Wuhan Iron and Steel Construction Site Workers' Method of Building Their Own Dormitories is Worth Promoting
    (Our report) A number of worker dormitories built by the workers themselves with their own money have appeared on the construction site of Wuhan Iron and Steel. Yan Yingchun, the electrician team leader of the Second Engineering Company of Wuhan Iron and Steel Construction General Company, is also one of the participants in the self-construction. He used the forty yuan bonus he received in 1955 and the first half of 1956, and took advantage of his Sunday holidays to exchange labor with other workers and build a thatched cottage of more than 20 square meters. This self-built thatched cottage also has a small kitchen, and the family of seven lives comfortably. He said: My house is warm in winter and cool in summer, and it can be repaired once a year, so I can live in it for seven or eight years. He said: The house he built is not the cheapest; some people only spent thirty yuan on one.
    Workers who rent farmers' houses were happy to hear this news, and felt it was a good way to go. Some workers said, "This is a good idea, it will pay for itself in ten months." Many workers said that as long as the leadership can help solve the problems of water and electricity installation, allocate land, and purchase materials in a unified manner, they are willing to build their own houses.
    The problem of workers' housing is a difficult one to solve. Last year, a number of simple worker dormitories were built on the construction site of Wuhan Iron and Steel Company, each room being 13 square meters and costing about 130 yuan. Due to the limitations of national investment, the built dormitories cannot solve the housing problem of all workers. "Self-construction with public assistance" was originally a good way to solve the housing problem of workers, but everyone was afraid of spending too much money, saying: If you spend more than one hundred yuan to build a house, I don’t know when you will be able to pay it off. Therefore, they are unwilling to take this path. As a result, some workers rented houses from farmers near the construction site, paying four or five yuan a month in rent, and the room area was only 10 square meters. If they don't live there, they can't find a more suitable or cheaper house. So they lived there first, and then applied to the public for housing, and the housing problem remained tense. The workers' housing in some enterprises was originally "self-built with public assistance," but in reality, the houses were built by the public first, and then the workers who lived in the houses repaid the construction costs on a monthly basis. However, after moving into the houses, many workers often failed to repay the full amount, and some even simply refused to pay. As a result, the form is "self-construction with public assistance," but in reality it has become "public construction for self-occupation."

### 群众自己的事依靠群众自己解决  武钢工地职工自建宿舍的办法值得推广

    群众自己的事依靠群众自己解决
    武钢工地职工自建宿舍的办法值得推广
    本报讯　武钢工地出现了一批由职工自己出钱建筑的职工宿舍。武汉钢铁建筑总公司第二工程公司一工地电工组长严迎春同志也是参加自建的一个。他利用1955年和1956年上半年得到的四十元奖金，借星期天休假的时间，同其他几位工人同志换工，修盖了一间二十多平方公尺的草房。这个自建的草房，一旁还搭了个小厨房，一家七口人住得满舒服。他说：我的房子冬暖夏凉，每年修补一次，保险能住七、八年。他说：他盖的房子还不是顶便宜的，有的人一间只用了三十元。
    租用农民房屋的工人听到这个消息，都觉得是个好门路。有的工人说：“这个办法好，住十个月就赚回来了。”很多工人表示，只要领导上能帮助解决水电安装，划拨地皮、统一购料等问题，都愿意自建房屋。
    职工住房问题是个很难解决的问题。去年，武汉钢铁公司工地修建了一批简易职工宿舍，每个房间十三平方公尺，造价约一百三十元。由于国家投资的限制，所建宿舍不能解决全体职工的住房问题。“自建公助”本来是解决职工住房的一个好办法，可是大家都怕花钱太多，说：花一百多元盖房子，不知道那年才能还清。因此都不愿意走这条路。于是，有一部分职工在工地附近租住农民的房屋，每月交四、五元的租金，房间面积只有十平方公尺。不住吧，又找不到更合适更便宜的房子。于是他们先住下去，然后又向公家申请住房，房子问题仍然紧张。有些企业的职工住房原是“自建公助”的，实际上是由公家出钱先建好房子，然后再由住房职工逐月偿还建房成本。可是有许多职工在住进房子以后，往往不能如数偿还，甚至有的干脆拒绝交款。结果形式上是“自建公助”，实际上成了“公建自住”。
