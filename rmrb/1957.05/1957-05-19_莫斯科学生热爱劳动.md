Moscow Students Love Labor
\tBy Our Correspondent Li He

\tEvery autumn during the busy harvest season, collective farmers in the suburbs of Moscow always invite Moscow university students to help. This is often a time of continuous autumn rain and muddy fields. The university students help the collective farmers dig potatoes for a week or two. Sometimes, the collective farms even request the schools to extend the students' labor for another week or two. The university students, who are not usually accustomed to physical labor, initially suffer from aching backs, but they all return to school full of energy; this is not only because they have contributed a little labor to society, but also because they have smelled the scent of the earth and had a warm encounter with the masses.

\tThe scene of Lenin carrying wood on Red Square is deeply imprinted in people's minds. Physical labor is recognized as the best exercise and self-education for people. In addition to a large number of volunteers dedicated to land reclamation and construction, Moscow youth also actively participate in physical labor in their spare time. The Central Stadium in Luzhniki, which has been built, contains the labor and enthusiasm of Moscow youth. Five thousand young volunteers participated in the construction there, and about 350,000 young men and women took turns working there on Sundays. Last autumn, a large number of Moscow university students went to the new lands to help with the harvest. Soviet Minister of State Farms Benediktov told us: "They did a lot of work. But the most important thing is that they learned what labor is. I think that university students should participate in practical labor in the future, but they don't have to go so far. Let Muscovites help Muscovites."

\tThe Central Stadium has been built, and the harvest on the new lands has passed, but Moscow students have not stopped physical labor. Not long ago, the Moscow secondary school Communist Youth League members held their first congress. Before the meeting, 1,500 student representatives participated in construction, including 300 who participated in the construction of the "Children's World" department store. The representatives of the 23rd school worked the best. All the senior students of this school participated in the construction work and decided to use the proceeds to organize summer trips and prepare for the World Youth Festival. A group of university students from the Chemical Industry Machinery Institute formed several shock brigades to work on construction sites in the district during the winter vacation. They set a good example. Since mid-February, a large number of university students from this institute have participated in residential construction. More than 100 volunteers work on the construction site every day. In order not to interfere with their studies, the work is divided into morning and afternoon shifts. The university students sweep up garbage, carry bricks, dig trenches, and repair boilers. A staff headquarters for student labor has been established in this institute, which plans how to reasonably use the students' working hours and liaises with the construction management agencies. Each university student has a booklet to record the quantity and quality of their work. They also publish construction diaries and bulletins, organize lectures and cultural entertainment, just like real construction workers. They worked tirelessly in this way until April 17, before the start of the exam period.

\tThe students' initiative to help with construction and the youth's enthusiasm to serve society became the basis for the Moscow Municipal Committee of the Soviet Lenin Communist Youth League's call for the city's youth to participate in construction in April. Now, the Youth League district committees have set up selection committees to select construction workers. Not only students but also workers and staff are signing up to participate in construction. Abramova, who has worked in the Second Clock Factory for seven years, is a skilled female worker, elected by her colleagues as a member of the workshop Youth League committee, studying in the ninth grade of a workers' night school, and she also takes time to participate in construction. One hundred and sixty young people from the same factory responded to her actions. Chernova, an accountant at a factory, developed a love for this line of work after participating in the construction of the Central Stadium, switched to construction, and recently received an honorary medal for her excellent work.

\tMoscow will build more than 11 million square meters of residential housing during this five-year plan, and 1.8 million square meters will be built this year alone. The Municipal Committee of the Youth League decided to send 15,000 Youth League members and young volunteers to support the construction during this summer vacation. Among them, 10,000 are students from institutions of higher learning, who will work on construction sites in the city for one month. In addition, the Municipal Committee of the Youth League called on every young person in Moscow to spare 20 hours of voluntary construction labor this year.

\tSummer vacation is approaching, and Moscow youth and students are eagerly preparing to participate in the capital's construction and exercise their bodies and minds in glorious physical labor.

    莫斯科学生热爱劳动	本报记者　李何
    每年秋天农忙时，莫斯科近郊的集体农民总要邀请莫斯科大学生去帮助。这往往是秋雨连绵、田间一片泥泞的时节。大学生们帮助集体农民挖上一两星期的马铃薯。集体农庄有时还请求学校延长学生的劳动个把星期。平素没有体力劳动习惯的大学生们，起初腰酸背痛，但回校时却个个精神饱满；这不只因为替社会效了一点劳，也因为嗅到了土地的气息，和群众亲热了一场。
    列宁在红场上抬木头的情景深深地印在人们的脑子里。体力劳动被公认为人们的最好锻炼和自我教育。除了大批献身开荒和建设的志愿者以外，莫斯科青年在课余业余也积极参加体力劳动。在卢日尼基建成的中央体育场，就含有莫斯科青年的劳动和热情。曾经有五千青年志愿者参加那里的建筑，曾经有约三十五万男女青年在星期天轮流到那里做工。去年秋天，大批莫斯科大学生曾到新地去帮助收割。苏联国营农场部部长别涅吉克托夫对我们说过：“他们做了很多工。但是最主要的是，他们知道了什么是劳动。我觉得，大学生今后还要实际地参加劳动，可是不必跑那么远去。让莫斯科人协助莫斯科人好了。”
    中央体育场建成了，新地上的收割过去了，但是莫斯科学生没有停止体力劳动。不久以前，莫斯科中等学校的青年团员举行了第一次大会。在会议前，一千五百名学生代表参加了建筑，当中有三百名参加了“儿童世界”百货商店的建筑。第二十三学校的代表们工作最好。这个学校的高班学生全体参加了建筑工作，决定把所得的报酬用在举办夏季旅行和准备世界青年联欢节上。化学工业机械学院有一批大学生，在寒假期间组成几个突击队在本区的工地上劳动。他们做出了好榜样。从2月中旬起，这个学院有大批大学生参加住宅建筑。每天有一百多个志愿者在工地上劳动。为了不妨碍学习，工作分成上下午两班。大学生们打扫垃圾，搬运砖块，挖掘壕沟，修理锅炉。在这个学院成立了大学生劳动的参谋部，它筹划如何合理地使用大学生的工作时间，和建筑管理机关取得联系。每个大学生都有一本登记工作数量和质量的簿子。他们也出版建筑日志、快报，组织讲演和文化娱乐，像真正的建筑工人一样。他们这样不懈地一直工作到4月17日考期到来之前。
    学生们帮助建筑的创举，青年们效劳社会的热情，成为4月间苏联列宁共产主义青年团莫斯科市委会号召全市青年参加建筑的基础。现在青年团区委会都设立了选拔委员会，挑选建筑劳动者。报名参加建筑的，不只有学生，而且有工人和职员。阿布拉莫娃，在第二钟表厂工作已经七年，是一个熟练女工，被同伴们选举为车间团委会委员，在工人夜校九年级学习，她也抽出时间参加建筑。同厂有一百六十个青年响应她的举动。车尔诺娃，一个工厂的会计，在参加中央体育场的建筑以后，爱好了这一行，转业建筑，不久前因为工作优异得到荣誉奖章。
    莫斯科在这个五年计划期间要建筑一千一百多万平方公尺居住面积的住宅，仅仅在今年就要盖一百八十万平方公尺。团市委会决定在今年暑假期间派遣一万五千团员和青年志愿者去支援。其中一万是高等学校的学生，他们将在市内建筑工地上做一个月工。此外，团市委会号召莫斯科全市青年每个人在今年抽空做二十点钟的义务建筑劳动。
    暑假快要来临，莫斯科青年学生们跃跃欲试地准备参加首都的建筑，在光荣的体力劳动中锻炼一下身心。
