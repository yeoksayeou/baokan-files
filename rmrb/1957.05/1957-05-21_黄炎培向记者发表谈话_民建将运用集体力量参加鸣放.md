This newspaper reports from Nanjing on the 20th: Huang Yanpei, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Chairman of the Central Standing Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association (CDNCA), spoke to reporters from the People's Daily and Xinhua Daily on the 19th in Nanjing.

Huang Yanpei discussed the urgent problems to be solved in the current socialist transformation of industry and commerce. He said that the main problem is essentially how to further promote the enthusiasm of industrialists and businessmen and contribute their talents. At present, the reasons hindering industrialists and businessmen from giving full play to their enthusiasm, as far as the upper echelons of industry and commerce are concerned, mainly concern how to improve the public-private partnership and ensure that the private sector has both responsibilities and authority. He said that there are still a considerable number of public sector personnel who do not fully understand the changes in the private sector after the high tide of socialist transformation, and therefore lack trust in them and have not been able to help the private sector personnel to fully utilize their talents. As far as the middle and lower levels of industry and commerce are concerned, the main problems are related to welfare. For example, the issue of sick leave pay is a problem that urgently needs to be properly addressed. In addition, for industrialists and businessmen, it is important to further make them aware that their social status has undergone a major transformation, that is, from the original status of purely bourgeois elements, they have begun to transform into workers, and therefore, their positions, viewpoints, and work methods must also undergo fundamental changes.

Regarding the current concerns of industrialists and businessmen about "speaking out" ("ming") and "airing views" ("fang"), Huang Yanpei said that the main reason is that industrialists and businessmen do not fully understand the spirit of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) using the method of "attacking from within and without" to thoroughly rectify its work style. Some industrialists and businessmen are still afraid of being retaliated against after "speaking out" and "airing views." In order to help them eliminate their concerns, in addition to senior Party and government leaders continuing to adopt various methods to encourage industrialists and businessmen to "speak out" and "air their views," attention should also be paid to ensuring that Party and government leaders at all levels, especially Party and government leaders and public sector personnel in enterprises who are in direct contact with the masses, can first express their attitude and encourage private sector personnel to "speak out" and "air their views." The CDNCA organizations should also help industrialists and businessmen eliminate their concerns.

Huang Yanpei said that the China Democratic National Construction Association must help the Chinese Communist Party rectify its work style with a positive attitude. He said, "We believe that the 'speaking out' and 'airing views' of CDNCA members is actually a question of representing the legitimate interests of industrialists and businessmen. The CDNCA organizations should encourage members to 'air views' and 'speak out.' Doing so is to implement the Chinese Communist Party's policy of 'long-term coexistence' and 'mutual supervision' with the democratic parties, and to play a supervisory role. We have not done enough in this regard in the past, and this time, we must make up for it greatly."

Huang Yanpei said, "We also believe that, in addition to each member expressing his or her own opinions, CDNCA members should also use collective strength to put forward our specific proposals on certain current issues related to socialist transformation and construction. We believe that using collective strength to 'speak out' and 'air views' can not only make our opinions more complete and comprehensive, but also link theory with practice in discussions, appropriately carry out criticism and self-criticism, thereby improving our own political level. I believe that our democratic parties, especially our CDNCA, should humbly learn from the Party's spirit of rectification, further transform ourselves, and do our work well."

Regarding how the CDNCA organizations should collectively "speak out" and "air views," Huang Yanpei said that while widely encouraging individuals to "air views" and "speak out," the CDNCA organizations can adopt the method of collective "airing views" and "speaking out" in places where conditions permit, based on individual "airing views" and "speaking out."

### 黄炎培向记者发表谈话  民建将运用集体力量参加鸣放

    黄炎培向记者发表谈话
    民建将运用集体力量参加鸣放
    本报南京20日电　全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长、民主建国会中央常务委员会主任委员黄炎培，于19日在南京向人民日报和新华日报记者发表了谈话。
    黄炎培谈到当前工商业社会主义改造中亟待解决的问题。他说，主要的问题基本上是如何使工商界人士进一步发挥积极性，贡献自己的才能的问题。目前阻碍工商界人士发挥积极性的原因，就工商界上层人士来说，主要是如何改进公私共事关系，使私方有职有权的问题。他说，目前还有相当多的公方人员，由于对私方人员在高潮以后的变化认识不足，因而对他们信任不足，没有能够帮助私方人员充分发挥他们的才能。就工商界中的中下层来说，主要是生活福利上的问题。例如病假工资的问题，就是一个当前亟待正确处理的问题。此外对于工商界人士来说如何进一步使工商界人士认识到他们的社会地位已经有了大转变，即由原来的纯粹资产阶级分子的地位，开始向劳动者的地位转变，因此，他们的立场、观点、以及工作方法也就都必需有根本性的转变。
    关于目前工商界对于“鸣”“放”的顾虑，黄炎培说，主要是工商界人士对中国共产党用“内外夹攻”的方法来彻底整风的精神认识不足。有些工商界人士还怕在“鸣”“放”之后，会受到报复。为了帮助他们消除顾虑，除了高级的党政领导同志要继续采取各种方法，鼓励工商界人士“鸣”“放”外，也要注意到使各级党政领导同志特别是直接同群众接近的党政领导人员以及企业里的公方人员能够首先表示态度，鼓励私方人员“鸣”“放”才对。民建组织也应当帮助工商界人士清除顾虑。
    黄炎培说，民主建国会一定要以积极的态度帮助中国共产党整风。他说，我们认为民建成员的“鸣”“放”，实际上也就是一个代表工商界的合法利益的问题。民建组织应当鼓励成员“放”“鸣”。这样做，也就是贯彻中国共产党提出的它和各民主党派“长期共存”“互相监督”的方针，发挥监督的作用。过去我们在这方面做得很不够，这次，我们一定要大大补课。
    黄炎培说，我们还认为：民建的成员，除了各人可以发表他自己的意见外，也还要运用集体的力量对目前的某些有关社会主义改造和建设的问题提出我们的具体主张。我们认为：运用集体力量来“鸣”“放”，除了可以使我们所提的意见更加完整更加全面外，也还可以在讨论中联系实际，适当地展开批评与自我批评，从而提高我们自己的政治水平。我认为：我们民主党派，特别是我们民建，应当虚心地向党的这一整风精神学习，更进一步地改造我们自己，做好我们的工作。
    关于民建组织如何集体“鸣”“放”的问题，黄炎培说，在广泛鼓励个人“放”“鸣”的同时，在有条件的地方，民建组织可以在个人“放”“鸣”的基础上，采取集体“放”“鸣”的办法。
