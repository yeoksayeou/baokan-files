    The Most Cordial Meeting	Gao Liang, Zheng Qimin
    Under the sunshine, the CPPCC Auditorium was so solemn and simple. The only difference from the past was a radiant national flag fluttering on the roof. Cheers, applause, and laughter kept coming from the columned entrance. The Third National Congress of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League opened here.

    When the First National Congress of the Youth League was held in 1949, there were only 190,000 Youth League members nationwide; when the Second National Congress of the Youth League was held in 1953, it had grown to 9.9 million members; today, those present are representatives of 23 million Youth League members.

    Chairman Mao and members of the Political Bureau of the Party Central Committee, along with leaders of various democratic parties, came to attend the meeting, and the venue immediately erupted. A delegate sitting in the middle row said to a Miao girl next to him, "Look at Chairman Mao, how kind he is! The person behind him is Vice Chairman Zhu, right? I heard that when the Red Army arrived in northern Shaanxi on the Long March, he was our youth captain!"

    After Liao Chengzhi read the opening speech, Comrade Deng Xiaoping, on behalf of the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, delivered a congratulatory speech at the congress. The congratulatory speech closely touched the heartstrings of all the delegates. Liao Chengzhi was so excited that he said in a very loud voice: "We are grateful for Comrade Deng Xiaoping's congratulations. We represent 23 million Youth League members to guarantee to the Party and Chairman Mao that Chinese youth will advance forever in accordance with the direction pointed out by the Party." Yes, this is the feeling of all the representatives at the meeting, and it is also what the vast number of Youth League members across the country want to say.

    Looking back from this meeting to thirty-three years ago, it was exactly when the Third Congress of the French General Branch of the Chinese Communist Youth League was held in Paris. Today, Comrade Deng Xiaoping, who delivered the congratulatory speech on behalf of the CPC Central Committee, was a delegate at that time, and Premier Zhou Enlai, who is here to attend the meeting today, was also a delegate at that time. Before the opening of the conference, the reporter interviewed Marshal Nie Rongzhen, a veteran member of the Communist Youth League more than 30 years ago. At that time, he smiled amiably and took out a photo for the reporter to see, and said: Can you recognize anyone here? Now put this photo here. This is a group photo taken in Paris at the Third Congress of the French General Branch of the Chinese Communist Youth League in July 1924. The first person in the front row from the left is Marshal Nie Rongzhen himself, the fourth person is Comrade Zhou Enlai, the sixth person is Comrade Li Fuchun, and the third person from the right in the last row is Comrade Deng Xiaoping. How fast time and people's ages change and progress with the changes of the times! Now they are already national leaders. More than 30 years ago, they were still a group of students who were studying while working with the purpose of seeking knowledge and a way out!

    During the break of the meeting, Chairman Mao and other responsible comrades of the Party Central Committee walked into the first lounge. At this time, dozens of representatives of Tibetan, Miao, Mongolian, Yi, Uygur, Han and other ethnic groups surrounded Chairman Mao. After Chairman Mao shook hands with them one by one, the representatives squatted freely beside Chairman Mao like seeing their most loving father. Squatting in front of the chairman was Xu Jianchun, a nationally famous agricultural labor model and a graduate of junior high school. With enthusiastic tears in her eyes, she held Chairman Mao's right hand tightly and called out in a low voice, "Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao!" Looking at her expression, it seemed that she had a lot to say to Chairman Mao, but her overly excited heart prevented her from saying anything. Later, she lit a match and said, "Chairman Mao, please have a cigarette!" Chairman Mao held Xu Jianchun's hand holding the match with both hands, and lit the cigarette with a smile. Just as he was about to ask Xu Jianchun something, Tibetan representative Xuekang·Tudeng Nyima, Miao representative Wu Laofen, and Sichuan representative Ren Jie, who were squatting behind Chairman Mao, said in unison in Chinese: "We hope to take a photo with Chairman Mao." The word "photo" seemed to have not yet been spoken, and applause rang out throughout the lounge. Then representatives and photographers surrounded them, and mercury lights flashed one after another like summer lightning.

    In the east of the lounge, a group of representatives were talking enthusiastically with Comrade Liu Shaoqi about the issue of Youth League cadres participating in physical labor. Comrade Shaoqi asked a representative squatting in front of his right: "What's your name, and which place are you from?" The representative said: "My name is Liang Shaowen, I am a Miao, and I am now the secretary of the Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture Committee of the League." Comrade Shaoqi asked: "Have you participated in physical labor in the past?" Comrade Liang Shaowen said: "No." Comrade Shaoqi continued: "If you don't participate in physical labor, you can't do a good job in youth work!" Comrade Liang Shaowen said firmly: "Comrade Shaoqi, I guarantee to you that after returning from this meeting, I will often go deep into the laboring youth, take the lead in participating in physical labor, and completely change the work style of the League cadres in our prefecture." Comrade Shaoqi nodded and smiled and said: "Good, in this way, you will be both civil and military." Everyone laughed.

    At this time, Hu Yaobang, secretary of the Central Secretariat of the Youth League, walked in from the front door of the lounge and shouted loudly: "Everyone, come and take a photo with the old Communist Youth League members!" So the representatives flocked to the side of Zhou Enlai, Deng Xiaoping, Xiao Hua and other comrades, the oldest members of the Chinese Communist Youth League, like a tide. Applause and laughter rang out again. (With pictures)

    最亲切的会见	高粮　郑启民
    在阳光的照耀下，政协礼堂是那样的庄严，朴素，它与往日不同的只是楼顶上飘起了一面红光四射的国旗。欢呼声、掌声和笑声，从圆柱大门里不断传来。中国新民主主义青年团第三次全国代表大会，在这里开幕了。
    1949年开第一次团代会时全国只有十九万团员；1953年开第二次团代会时发展为九百九十万团员；今天在坐的却已是二千三百万团员的代表了。
    毛主席和党中央政治局的委员们同各民主党派的领袖来参加会议了，会场顿时沸腾起来。坐在中排的一位代表对他身旁的一位苗族姑娘说：“你看毛主席，他老人家多慈祥呀！他身后面的人就是朱副主席吧，听说红军长征到了陕北时他还当过咱们青年人的队长呢！”
    廖承志宣读开幕词后，邓小平同志代表中国共产党中央委员会总书记在大会上致祝词。祝词紧紧地扣住了全体代表的心弦。廖承志被激动得说话了，他用十分响亮的声音说：“我们感激邓小平同志的祝贺，我们代表二千三百万青年团员向党和毛主席保证，中国青年将依照党所指出的方向，永远前进。”是的，这是会场上所有代表的感情，也是全国广大青年团员要说的话。
    从这次会议回溯到三十三年以前，正是中国共产主义青年团法国总支部在巴黎举行第三次代表大会的时候。今天，代表中共中央致祝词的邓小平同志是当时的代表，今天来这里参加会议的周恩来总理也是当时的代表。大会开幕前，记者访问了三十多年前的老共青团员聂荣臻元帅。当时他笑容可掬地拿出一张照片给记者看，并说：你能认出这里有谁吗？现在把这张照片摆在这里，这就是1924年7月中国共产主义青年团法国总支部第三次代表大会在巴黎开会时的合影，左起前排第一人就是聂荣臻元帅自己，第四人是周恩来同志，第六人是李富春同志，而最后一排右起第三人就是邓小平同志。时间和人的年龄随着时代的变化进展的多快呀！现在他们已经是国家的领袖。三十多年前他们还是一群以寻找知识和生路为目的的勤工俭学的学生啊！
    大会休息的时候，毛主席和党中央其他负责同志走进了第一休息室。这时藏、苗、蒙、彝、维、
  汉等民族的几十位代表把毛主席围
  了起来。毛主席同他们一一地握手之后，代表们像见到自己最慈爱的父亲一样，无拘无束地就地蹲在毛主席的身旁。蹲在主席最前面的是全国著名的农业劳动模范、高小毕业生徐建春，她眼眶里含着热情的泪珠，紧紧地握住毛主席的右手，小声地叫着“毛主席！毛主席！”看她那表情，好像有许多话要向毛主席说，但是她那过于激动着的心却使她什么话也说不出来。后来她顺手划了一根火柴，说了声：“毛主席，请你抽烟吧！”毛主席双手捧着徐建春的拿着火柴的手，一面笑着一面把烟点着，正要开口问徐建春什么，蹲在毛主席身后面的藏族代表雪康·土登尼玛，苗族代表吴老芬和四川代表任杰等用汉话齐声说：“我们希望同毛主席一块照个像”，“像”字好像还没有说出来，整个休息室里就响起了一片掌声，接着代表们和摄影师都围过来，水银灯光像夏天的闪电一样一个接着一个地亮起来了。
    在休息室的东面，一群代表正在和刘少奇同志热烈地谈着青年团的干部参加体力劳动的问题。少奇同志向蹲在他右前方的一个代表问道：“你叫什么名字，是哪个地方的代表？”这个代表说：“我叫梁绍文，是苗族人，现在担任团湘西苗族自治州委书记。”少奇同志问： “你过去参加过体力劳动没有？”梁绍文同志说：“没有”。少奇同志接着说：“你们不参加体力劳动，就做不好青年工作啊！”梁绍文同志坚决地说：“少奇同志，我向你保证，这次开会回去之后，一定要经常深入到劳动青年中去，带头参加体力劳动，彻底改变我们州里团干部的工作作风。”少奇同志一面点头一面笑着说：“好，这样你们就既能文又能武了。”大家都笑了起来。
    这时，青年团中央书记处书记胡耀邦同志从休息室的前门走了进来，大声地喊了一声：“大家都来同老共青团员们照相啊！”于是代表们像潮水一般地向中国最老的共青团员周恩来、邓小平、萧华等同志的身边拥来。掌声、欢笑声又响成了一片。（附图片）
