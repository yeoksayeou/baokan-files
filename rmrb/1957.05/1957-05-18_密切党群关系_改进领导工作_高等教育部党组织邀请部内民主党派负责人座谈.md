Strengthening Party-Masses Relations, Improving Leadership Work
Higher Education Ministry Party Organization Invites Democratic Party Leaders for Discussion

(Our newspaper reports) The Chinese Communist Party Higher Education Ministry Party Group and Party Committee invited responsible persons from various democratic parties and non-party individuals within the Ministry for a discussion yesterday afternoon. At the meeting, Vice Minister Liu Zizai, representing the Higher Education Ministry Party Organization, invited everyone to offer opinions on the Party's leadership work in the Higher Education Ministry, to help the Party organization rectify its work style, and to improve leadership work.

At the meeting, everyone expressed many valuable opinions.

Lao Junzhan said: People criticize the Higher Education Ministry for acting too quickly and changing policies frequently, like somersaults. This is very much related to the poor coordination of work between the various departments in our ministry. Each department in the ministry assigns work to the schools, emphasizing the importance of their own work. For example, after the work quota system for teachers was assigned, some university teachers said that now the Higher Education Ministry is no longer engaged in scientific research, only paying attention to teaching. The ministry and each department only care about their own work. Once the work is assigned, it becomes chaotic in the schools. There are also many changes in the ministry's structure. For example, the Teaching Guidance Department has had many disasters since the establishment of the Higher Education Ministry. It seems to live and die unpredictably, sometimes existing and sometimes not. In addition, I also have some opinions on the ministry's decision on the training goals of comprehensive universities. Why should the task of training middle school teachers also be given to comprehensive universities? I don't understand. Training middle school teachers should be the task of normal universities. Only in this way can the quality of teachers be guaranteed.

Chen Aimin said: The Higher Education Ministry does not pay enough attention to non-Party members. When departments send comrades down to inspect work, Party members can directly talk to the school leaders, but non-Party members cannot directly talk. It is difficult for non-Party members to carry out inspections because they do not know what to ask and what not to ask. Leaders see more advantages than disadvantages in Party members and Communist Youth League members, and more disadvantages than advantages in the masses. The treatment is unfair. The work of several young comrades in the Industry Department was originally similar, but the leaders praised the League members. Whether it is listening to reports or watching plays, the tickets issued are first given to Party and League members, and only given to the masses if the Party and League members do not go. Chen Aimin also said that Minister Yang Xiufeng did not consider and listen to the opinions of the business departments enough. For example, there is a contradiction between the number and quality of students in the industrial colleges. Too many students are enrolled, and the quality is very low. Many industrial colleges are calling for a reduction in enrollment, but the leaders of the ministry have not considered this opinion well. There are also problems with retaining teaching assistants in schools. Those who are retained are often the students with poorer grades, and these teaching assistants cannot be trained to become lecturers at all. These opinions have also been raised to the ministry but have not been well resolved. In addition, Minister Yang once asked teachers to write teaching guides. In fact, teachers have many difficulties in writing them, but Minister Yang emphasized that they should be written, so it was assigned. Later, it was said that writing teaching guides would be paid royalties. How to pay it is very difficult. Everyone raised several opinions, but the leaders did not change.

Qing Ruji said: It is natural that the Higher Education Ministry has difficulties in doing great things in a short period. We should grasp the central issues to solve them. The key to improving academic level and training a large number of construction talents lies in tapping the potential of the old intellectuals in schools. The Party must value them and give play to their creativity. At present, some of our work in universities is inappropriate. For example, grading professors into many levels, with large differences, has caused many opinions from professors. In addition, regarding the "Hundred Schools of Thought" policy, I feel that this is not an empty slogan. It needs research and mastering information. Currently, those engaged in natural sciences have assistants, while those engaged in social sciences do not have assistants, so research work is somewhat difficult. Many materials have to be copied by themselves.

Sun Erlun said: The biggest sectarianism in the Higher Education Ministry is to exclude secondary vocational education. When the ministry assigns work, the Secondary Vocational Education Department is often left out. The ministry's party group rarely discusses secondary vocational education work at meetings. Now there are so many people in the ministry, but only nineteen people are in charge of secondary vocational education. In this rectification campaign, the ministry did not invite teachers from some secondary vocational schools to have discussions and solicit opinions. How should secondary vocational education be carried out? The leaders of the ministry should study it well.

Li Jiemin said: Currently, some comrades still have ideological concerns even though they have opinions on the Party. This problem should be solved. The ministry trusts Party member cadres more and pays attention to giving play to their expertise, while non-Party members are often transferred more and their expertise is not taken care of. He said that the Party wants people who are yes-men, and people who are good at giving opinions do not get along well. Party members have sectarian emotions, such as chatting and laughing among themselves, while being frosty to non-Party members. Party members are accommodating to each other, but not to non-Party members. He believes that to improve Party-masses relations, both sides must tear down the walls. The Party should truly implement the mass line, closely contact the masses, make more friends with the masses, care for them politically and in life, and handle problems fairly and reasonably. Non-Party members should also take the initiative to get closer to the Party, reflect problems to the Party, and exchange thoughts, so as to improve their thinking and improve Party-masses relations.

At the meeting, Yu Zhijie, Shi Jiuyun, Hao Guangyan and others also put forward specific opinions on the relationship between the Party and intellectuals and the issue of the Party's contact with the masses. The meeting ended at six o'clock. Vice Minister Liu Zizai said that he hoped everyone would continue to offer opinions in the future.

### 密切党群关系　改进领导工作  高等教育部党组织邀请部内民主党派负责人座谈

    密切党群关系　改进领导工作
    高等教育部党组织邀请部内民主党派负责人座谈
    本报讯　中共高等教育部党组和党委会，在昨天下午邀请部里的各民主党派负责人和无党派人士举行座谈。会上刘子载副部长代表高等教育部党组织，请大家对高等教育部党的领导工作提意见，帮助党组织整风，改进领导工作。
    会上，大家发表了许多宝贵的意见。
    劳君展说：人家批评高等教育部办事变的快，朝令夕改，像翻筋斗一样。这和我们部里各司工作配合得不好很有关系。部里每个司都向学校布置工作，强调自己的工作重要。例如教师工作量制度布置下去以后，有些高等学校的教师就说，现在高等教育部又不搞科学研究了，光注意搞教学了。部里、各司只顾各管各的，工作一布置下去，到了学校里就忙乱起来。部里机构的变化也多，譬如教学指导司自从高等教育部成立以来，真是多灾多难，生死不定，一会有，一会又没有了。另外，我对部里关于综合大学培养目标的决定上，也有点意见，为什么要将培养中学教师的任务也交给综合大学呢？我想不通。培养中学教师应该是师范大学的任务，只有这样，教师的质量才能保证。
    陈蔼民说：高教部对非党员是重视不够的。司里派同志下去检查工作，党员可以直接找学校的领导人交谈，而非党员就不能直接找。非党员下去检查工作，很难进行，不知道那些该问，那些不该问。领导上看党团员是优点多于缺点，看群众是缺点多于优点，对待不公平。工业司有几个青年同志的工作本来都差不多，领导上却表扬了团员。无论听报告、看戏等发的票都是先给党团员，党团员不去才给群众。陈蔼民还说，杨秀峰部长考虑和听取业务部门的意见不够，如工业学院方面的学生数量和质量是有矛盾的，招生太多，质量很低。不少工业学院都叫喊要削减招生人数，但对这个意见部的领导方面却没很好考虑。学校留助教也有问题，留下的往往是学生中成绩较坏的，这些助教根本不可能培养成讲师，这些意见也提到部里没得到很好解决；还有，杨部长曾要教师们写教学指导书，实际上教师们写起来困难很多，但杨部长强调要写，也就布置下去了。以后又说写教学指导书要发给稿费，怎么发法，很困难。大家提了几项意见，但领导上没有改变。
    卿如楫说：高等教育部要在短时期内办大事业，自然是有困难的。我们应该抓中心问题来解决。提高学术水平，培养大批建设人才，关键在于发挥学校中的老知识分子的潜力，党要重视他们，发挥他们的创造性。目前我们对高等学校中的一些工作弄得有不合适的，譬如把教授评为许多等级，差别很大，引起教授许多意见。此外在百家争鸣方面，我觉得这不是句空话，需要研究，需要掌握资料。目前搞自然科学的有助手，而搞社会科学的没有助手，研究工作就有些困难，许多资料要自己去抄。
    孙尔纶说：高等教育部里最大的宗派主义就是排斥中等专业教育，部里布置什么工作，经常都是把中等专业教育司漏掉了。部里党组开会很少讨论中等专业教育工作，现在部里这样多人，但只有十九个人管中等专业教育工作。在这次整风中，部里也没有找些中等专业学校的教师来座谈，征求意见，究竟中等专业教育怎么办下去？部里领导上是应该很好的研究的。
    李洁民说：目前还有些同志虽然对党有意见，但是还有思想顾虑，这个问题应解决。部里对党员干部比较信任，注意发挥专长，而对非党员则常常是调动多，不照顾专长。他说党要的是唯唯诺诺的人，好提意见的人不大吃得开。党员有宗派情绪，如党员之间有说有笑，而对非党员则冷若冰霜。党员之间通人情，对非党员就不通人情。他认为要搞好党群关系，必须两面都拆墙，党应真正贯彻群众路线，密切联系群众，多和群众交朋友，在政治上、生活上关心他们，处理问题要公平合理；而非党员也要主动靠近党，向党反映问题，交谈思想，这样才能提高思想，搞好党群关系。
    会上，余之介、史久芸、郝光炎等也分别对党同知识分子的关系问题，党同群众联系的问题，提了具体意见。会议到六时结束。刘子载副部长说，希望大家在今后继续提意见。
