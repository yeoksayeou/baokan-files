Xinhua News Agency, New York, 19th – According to TASS, the magazine "U.S. News & World Report" reports that the U.S. military is currently establishing special armed forces to carry out sabotage activities against socialist countries. These forces are somewhat similar to the American army's foreign legion and also resemble the notorious French Foreign Legion.

According to the magazine, every three or four weeks, batches of traitors from socialist countries are secretly flown from a gathering point established by the U.S. military in Frankfurt, West Germany, to the United States, where they receive military training at the U.S. military base at Fort Jackson (South Carolina).

Specialized schools and infantry centers have already been established at Fort Jackson to train these individuals, and the U.S. authorities plan to form them into a force of 12,000.

When discussing the purpose and tasks of these sabotage forces, the magazine pointed out that they will be sent to people's democratic countries and the Soviet Union to engage in military operations.

    新华社19日讯　据塔斯社纽约18日讯：据“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志报道，美国军队目前正在建立对社会主义国家进行破坏活动的特别武装部队。这些部队有些类似美军的外籍军团，也像臭名远扬的法国外籍军团。
    据杂志报道，每隔三、四个星期就有几批社会主义国家的叛徒从美军在西德法兰克福设立的集合点悄悄地乘飞机来到美国，并且在杰克逊堡（南卡罗来纳州）的美国军事基地受军事训练。
    在杰克逊堡已经设立了专门学校和步兵中心来训练这些人，美国当局计划把他们组成一支一万二千人的部队。
    杂志在谈到这些破坏部队的目的和任务时指出，他们将被派到人民民主国家和苏联去从事军事行动。
