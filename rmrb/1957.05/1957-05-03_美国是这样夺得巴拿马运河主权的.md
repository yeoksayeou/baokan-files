    How the United States Seized Sovereignty over the Panama Canal

    On April 14, the President of Panama, Ernesto de la Guardia Jr., issued a statement reiterating Panama's determination to defend its sovereignty over the Panama Canal Zone. Many readers have written to inquire how the United States acquired "sovereignty" over the Panama Canal. Here's a brief answer:

    Since the Egyptian government announced the nationalization of the Suez Canal, a series of disputes have arisen between Panama and the United States regarding sovereignty over the Panama Canal. Panama demands the restoration of its sovereignty over the canal, but the United States has consistently denied Panama any sovereignty over this canal traversing its territory, insisting that under the 1903 Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty, the United States has acquired "permanent" sovereignty over the canal and the Canal Zone, and that the Panama Canal is already a "national canal" of the United States.

    How did the United States obtain this "sovereignty" over the Panama Canal? Even American history books cannot deny that the United States fabricated the Republic of Panama in order to seize the Canal Zone, and that the American "sovereignty" over the Panama Canal Zone was the loot from this international conspiracy. Theodore Roosevelt, the U.S. President famous for implementing the "Big Stick" policy, once boasted frankly: "I took the Canal Zone."

    Perhaps no one knows the details of this grand conspiracy better than the current U.S. Secretary of State, John Foster Dulles. Records of this incident are still preserved in the archives of Dulles' Sullivan & Cromwell law firm at 48 Wall Street, because Cromwell, the former leader of this firm, specifically participated in planning and arranging this conspiracy.

    As early as 1880, after completing the Suez Canal, French engineer Ferdinand de Lesseps established the Panama Canal Company and obtained a concession from the Colombian government to dig the Panama Canal. Due to technical difficulties, financial shortages, and a large number of workers dying from yellow fever, this company could not sustain itself. With the support of American capitalists, a New Panama Canal Company was established. Soon, the new company hired Cromwell, who had influence in Washington, as its legal advisor, and began the work of transferring the excavation rights to the United States.

    Originally, the U.S. government had intended to excavate a canal in Nicaragua. Cromwell first bribed the Senate to oppose the excavation of a canal in Nicaragua. Subsequently, he spent $60,000 to support McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt's election (in 1900, Theodore Roosevelt was originally elected as Vice President, and only became President after McKinley was assassinated), in exchange for the Republican Party's platform advocating the excavation of a canal in Panama. After the Republican Party came to power, it acquired all the assets and excavation rights of the New Panama Canal Company for $40 million, and then made an unreasonable demand to the Colombian government for a long-term lease of a portion of land in the Panama Isthmus. The Colombian government not only refused to sign this treaty selling out its sovereignty, but also did not recognize the transfer of the canal excavation rights.

    Thus, Cromwell assisted the U.S. government in planning a conspiracy to create a rebellion in Panama. Through Philippe-Jean Bunau-Varilla, a French adventurer and shareholder of the New Panama Canal Company, he bought off Manuel Amador Guerrero, a politician in Panama City, to launch an "independence revolution," promising him the position of "president" after success, and spending another $100,000 to buy off a small group of local politicians and military officers. On November 3, 1903, this group of people declared Panama's "independence" from Colombia. The U.S. fleet, which had been dispatched in advance, prevented the Colombian government's troops from suppressing the rebels. The so-called "revolution" was thus successful.

    The United States immediately recognized the Panamanian government. Soon, according to the intentions of the U.S. government, this government signed the aforementioned canal treaty, allowing the United States to purchase the properties of the Panama Canal Company and the Panama Railway Company, and also granting the United States a ten-mile-wide Canal Zone. That is how the United States' "permanent" sovereignty over the Panama Canal came about. (Attached picture)

### 美国是这样夺得巴拿马运河主权的

    美国是这样夺得巴拿马运河主权的
    4月14日，巴拿马总统德拉古阿迪亚发表声明，重申巴拿马将保卫它对巴拿马运河区的主权。许多读者来信询问美国是怎样获得巴拿马运河“主权”的？现简答如下：
    自从埃及政府宣布将苏伊士运河收归国有后，巴拿马和美国两国间对于巴拿马运河的主权问题发生了一连串的争执。巴拿马要求恢复它对运河的主权，但是美国却始终否认巴拿马对这条横贯它的国土的运河享有任何主权，硬说根据1903年的美巴条约，美国已经获得了运河和运河区的“永久”主权，巴拿马运河已经是美国的一条“国家运河”。
    美国对巴拿马运河的这个“主权”是怎样得来的呢？连美国的历史书也无法否认美国为了夺取运河区制造了巴拿马共和国，而美国对巴拿马运河区的“主权”就是这次国际大阴谋中的掠获物。当年以执行“大棒政策”出名的美国总统老罗斯福，曾经直认不讳地夸口说：“我拿到了运河区。”
    对这个大阴谋的经过，大概没有人会比现任美国国务卿杜勒斯知道得更为清楚。关于这桩事件的记录，现在仍然保存在华尔街四十八号杜勒斯的苏立文—克伦威尔法律事务所的档案里，因为就是这家事务所的前领导人克伦威尔，具体参预策划和布置了这次阴谋。
    远在1880年，法国工程师勒赛普在修成苏伊士运河之后，又成立了巴拿马运河公司，并且向哥伦比亚政府取得了开凿巴拿马运河的租借权。由于技术困难，经济短绌和大批工人死于黄热病，这家公司无法维持。在美国资本家资助下，新巴拿马运河公司又建立起来了。不久，新公司就聘请了对华盛顿有影响的克伦威尔为公司法律顾问，着手了把开凿权交给美国的工作。
    本来，美国政府曾经有意在尼加拉瓜开掘运河。克伦威尔首先贿赂参议院反对在尼加拉瓜开凿运河。随后，又出六万美元支持墨金莱和老罗斯福竞选（1900年老罗斯福原当选为副总统，后墨金莱被暗杀，始就任总统），代价是共和党在政纲上主张在巴拿马开凿运河。共和党上台后，就以四千万美元收购新巴拿马运河公司全部资财和运河开凿权，接着向哥伦比亚政府提出长期租借巴拿马海峡一部分土地的无理要求。哥伦比亚政府不仅拒绝签订这项出卖主权的条约，并且也不承认运河开凿权的转移。
    于是，克伦威尔就协助美国政府策划了一个阴谋，在巴拿马制造叛乱。他通过新巴拿马公司的一个股东法国冒险家布纳·瓦瑞拉，收买了巴拿马城的一个名叫曼纽尔·阿马多的政客，要他发动一次“独立革命”，并答应成功后给他“总统”职位，另以十万美金收买了一小撮地方政客和军官。1903年11月3日，这一批人就宣布巴拿马脱离哥伦比亚“独立”。事先出动的美国舰队阻止了哥伦比亚政府军队，使它不能对叛乱分子进行镇压。所谓“革命”就这样成功了。
    美国立即承认了巴拿马政府。不久，按照美国政府的意图，这个政府就签订了上面提到的运河条约，允许美国购买巴拿马运河公司和巴拿马铁路公司的财产，同时还给予美国一条十英里宽的运河区。美国对巴拿马运河的“永久”主权就是这样来的。（附图片）
