This year, many primary and secondary school graduates will not be able to continue their education and will instead participate in labor production, primarily agricultural production. This issue was discussed in detail in the editorial "On the Issue of Primary and Secondary School Graduates Participating in Agricultural Production" in this newspaper on April 8th. Currently, under the care and education of school administrations and Party and Youth League organizations, the majority of graduating primary and secondary school students have been able to correctly understand the ultimate purpose of studying, which is to serve production. They have expressed their determination to participate in various forms of productive labor when they are unable to continue their education. Many students' parents also enthusiastically support their children's correct attitude towards further education and employment, and have made the necessary arrangements for their children to participate in production.

However, it is worth noting that there are still many parents who do not have a clear understanding of the issue of students' further education and employment, and who one-sidedly hope that their children will continue their education. They still hold the erroneous idea that "all other occupations are inferior, only studying is noble." Some students' parents, who have come from the path of suffering in the old society and did not have the opportunity to study, now place their hopes for education on their children. Some students' parents believe that it is a loss of face for their children to participate in productive labor if they fail to get into school. In particular, some cadres, even responsible cadres, also have this incorrect idea. They make inappropriate demands on their children, harbor unrealistic hopes, and even put pressure on them. In this situation, many students are often stimulated at home. Although they realize that participating in productive labor is glorious, they are also afraid of being severely reprimanded by their parents if they fail to get into school. Some students say: "Now our ideological problem has been solved, and what needs to be solved is the ideological problem of the adults." This is a sincere expression of the thoughts of graduating primary and secondary school students.

So, how should we solve the "ideological problem of the adults"? As everyone knows, parents love their children very much and have many hopes for them. The main thing is to hope that their children will acquire more knowledge so that they can better serve the people in the future. This desire of parents is good and should be supported, and children should also satisfy their parents' earnest expectations. The problem is not here. The problem is, how can children acquire more knowledge? Is it only possible to acquire it in school? Or is it also possible to acquire it in labor production? We believe that while knowledge can certainly be acquired in school, it can also be acquired in labor production, and it is living knowledge. This kind of knowledge is indispensable for anyone; for educated youth, it is even more important to combine mental and physical labor. Even if children continue their education and acquire knowledge from books, it is for the purpose of better participating in productive labor in the future. Therefore, it is certainly good if children can continue their education; it is also good if children cannot continue their education and participate in productive labor. Parents should understand this principle and correctly treat the issue of their children's further education and employment.

Holding parent-teacher conferences in rural areas and neighborhoods is an effective way for schools to establish close contact with students' parents and jointly educate students. In rural areas, schools and students' residences are scattered and far apart, making it very inconvenient for parents to come to school for meetings, and it also delays production. In urban schools, students' residences are more concentrated, so parents can be invited to the school for meetings, or meetings can be held in different areas. The meetings should be lively and allow parents to speak freely, express their inner thoughts, and learn from each other. The Second Middle School of Luoning County, Henan Province, held parent-teacher conferences in fifteen villages and towns, where they specifically learned about the true thoughts of students and their parents, and conducted an in-depth publicity and education campaign on the issue of further education and employment. The parents clearly realized that they themselves and the school are responsible for the education of their children. The parent of student Duan Fengchan said: "The school educates within the three-foot door, but cannot educate outside the three-foot door. When students graduate and return, it becomes our responsibility."

Teachers are often also students' parents, and their attitude towards their children is constantly noticed by the surrounding students. Therefore, teachers should more correctly handle the issue of their own children's further education and employment, and use their own exemplary actions to influence graduating students. After studying this newspaper's editorial "On the Issue of Primary and Secondary School Graduates Participating in Agricultural Production," more than 450 teachers in Yixing County, Jiangsu Province, criticized the past erroneous idea that further education is the only path and that agricultural production is to be disregarded. They educated their children to correctly treat the issue of further education and employment, and launched a publicity campaign for this work. Teachers in various places also need to learn from them and take them as examples.

Workers in our Party and state organs, especially senior workers, should have an even more correct attitude towards the issue of their children's further education and employment. The Central Committee of the Party's instruction on the rectification movement emphasized the importance of physical labor, pointing out that Party leaders should spend some time participating in physical labor with workers and peasants. This instruction not only provides profound enlightenment to Party leaders, but also has great educational significance for all cadres in Party and state organs. Inspired by this instruction, our cadres should have a further improved understanding of their children's participation in labor production. The idea that one is a cadre and therefore one's children must continue their education and cannot participate in productive labor is a manifestation of a privileged mentality that is divorced from the masses and must be resolutely corrected. Cadres in Party and state organs should play an exemplary role among the people and make correct arrangements for their children without exception. Doing so can further strengthen the ties between the Party and state organs and the broad masses of the people.

Currently, there are only two months left until the summer vacation, and graduating students are preparing for exams. After parents have a correct understanding of the issue of their children's further education and employment, what else should they do? We hope that parents, together with teachers, should guide their children to prepare for the entrance exams (but the study should not be too intense and should not damage their health). On the other hand, parents should strengthen their education of their children, helping them to overcome the erroneous ideas of belittling labor and belittling workers and peasants. After the summer vacation, if children can continue their education, that is of course good; if they cannot continue their education and participate in production, that is also good. Parents should absolutely not discriminate against or blame children who cannot continue their education, but should instead comfort them and not make them feel embarrassed about their fragile feelings. For families in rural areas, parents should actively find ways to enable their children to participate in agricultural production, encouraging them to work hard to build a new countryside. For families in cities, parents should also, according to local conditions and their own family conditions, try their best to enable their children to engage in agricultural labor or other various forms of labor. For those who do not have the conditions to participate in labor and work for the time being, parents should arrange conditions for their children to study on their own, so that they can study at ease and help the family do some appropriate housework, in order to prepare better conditions for future production or further education.

For the sake of the country's socialist construction and for the sake of the bright future of their children, parents should earnestly work with school staff members to jointly shoulder the important responsibility of educating their children.

### 向学生家长讲清道理

    向学生家长讲清道理
    今年有许多中小学毕业生不能升学，将要参加劳动生产，首先是农业生产。对于这个问题，本报4月8日“关于中小学毕业生参加农业生产问题”的社论中，已经作了详细的讨论。目前，中小学应届毕业生在学校行政方面和党、团组织的关怀和教育下，大多数已经能够正确地认识读书的最终目的，就是为了生产，纷纷表示在不能升学的时候，就决心去参加各种生产劳动。许多学生家长也热烈支持学生对待升学和就业的正确态度，为学生参加生产作了必要的安排。
    但是，值得注意的是：还有不少家长对学生升学和就业的问题认识不清，思想上只是片面地希望子女升学。他们仍然抱着“万般皆下品，唯有读书高”的错误思想。有些学生的家长，从旧社会的苦难生活的道路上走过来，没有读书的机会，现在就把读书的希望寄托在子女身上。有些学生的家长认为子女考不上学校，去参加生产劳动，是有失面子的事情。特别是有些干部，甚至负责的干部，也有这种不正确的思想。他们向子女提出不恰当的要求，抱着不实际的希望，甚至对子女施加压力。在这种情况下，许多学生在家庭中常受刺激，自己虽然认识到参加生产劳动是光荣的，但是又害怕考不上学校会受到父母的严重责备。有的学生这样说：“现在我们的思想问题解决了，要解决的就是大人们的思想问题了”。这是表达了应届中小学毕业生思想的一句真心话。
    那么，到底应该怎样解决“大人们的思想问题”呢？大家知道，家长是非常爱护自己的子女的，对子女有很多的希望。主要的是希望子女求得更多的知识，以便将来能够更好地为人民服务。家长这个愿望是好的，是应当受到支持的，子女也应该满足家长殷勤的热望。问题不在这里，问题在于，怎样才能使子女求得更多的知识呢？是不是只有在学校中才能求得呢？还是在劳动生产中也能求得呢？我们认为，在学校中固然能求得知识，而在劳动生产中，同样也可以求得知识，而且是活的知识。这种知识，对于任何人来说，都是不可缺少的；对于知识青年来说，要求做到脑力劳动和体力劳动相结合，就更显得重要了。即使子女升了学，求得书本上的知识，也是为了明天更好地参加生产劳动。所以，子女能升学，固然很好；子女不能升学，参加生产劳动，那也很好。家长应该了解这个道理，正确对待子女的升学和就业问题。
    深入农村和街道，分片召开家长座谈会，是学校同学生的家长取得密切联系，共同教育学生的有效办法。农村学校和学生居住分散，路途遥远，请家长到学校开座谈会，很不方便，而且耽误生产。城市学校的学生居住比较集中，可以邀请家长到学校座谈，也可以分片座谈。座谈会应当生动活泼，使家长畅所欲言，说出心里的话，并且使家长们互相得到教育和启发。河南省洛宁县第二中学，分别在十五个村镇，分片召开家长座谈会，在会上具体了解了学生和学生家长的真实思想情况，深入地进行了一次升学和就业问题的宣传教育。家长们明确地认识到他们自己同学校对于孩子的教育都要负责。学生段逢婵的家长说：“学校教育了三尺门里，教育不了三尺门外。学生毕业回来，就成为我们的事了。”
    教师往往也是学生的家长，他们对待子女的态度，时时刻刻为周围学生所注意。因此，教师更应当正确地处理自己子女的升学和就业问题，以自己的模范行动来影响应届的毕业生。江苏省宜兴县四百五十多名教师，学习了本报“关于中小学毕业生参加农业生产问题”的社论以后，批判了过去认为升学是唯一道路，轻视农业生产的错误思想，教育自己的子女正确地对待升学和就业问题，并且开展了这项工作的宣传活动。各地教师也需要向他们学习，以他们为榜样。
    在我们的党和国家机关中的工作人员，特别是高级工作人员，对自己的子女升学和就业问题，更应该抱正确的态度。党中央关于整风运动的指示，强调了体力劳动的重要性，指出党的领导工作人员应该以一部分时间同工人农民一齐参加体力劳动。这个指示不仅给党的领导工作人员以深刻的启示，同时对于党和国家机关中的全体干部也有重大的教育意义。在这个指示的启发下，我们的干部对于自己的子女参加劳动生产的认识应该有进一步的提高。那种认为自己是个干部，子女就一定要升学，不能参加生产劳动的想法，是一种脱离群众的特权思想的表现，必须坚决加以纠正。党和国家机关中的干部，应该在人民群众中起模范作用，毫无例外地为子女作出正确的安排。这样做，也可以进一步密切党和国家机关同广大人民的联系。
    目前，距离暑假只有两个月的时间了，应届毕业生都在迎接考试。家长们在对待子女升学和就业的问题上有了正确的认识以后，还要做些什么工作呢？我们希望，家长在这个时候，要同教师一道，一方面指导子女准备升学考试（但是学习不可过分紧张，不可损害健康），另一方面，家长们要加强对子女的教育，帮助他们克服轻视劳动、轻视工农的错误思想。暑期以后，如果子女能够升学，当然很好；如果不能升学，而参加生产，那同样很好。家长绝对不要去歧视和责备不能升学的子女，而要加以体贴安慰，不使他们脆弱的心情感觉为难。家庭在农村的，家长应该积极设法使他们参加农业生产，鼓励他们为建设新农村而努力。家庭在城市的，家长也应当根据当地和自己家庭的条件，尽可能设法使他们从事农业劳动、或者其他各种劳动。对于一时没有参加劳动和工作的条件的，家长要给子女安排自学的条件，使他们安心自学，并且帮助家庭做些适当的家务劳动，为将来从事生产或升学准备更好的条件。
    为了国家的社会主义建设，为了子女的美好的将来，家长们应该认真地同学校工作人员同心协力，共同担负起教育子女的重要责任。
