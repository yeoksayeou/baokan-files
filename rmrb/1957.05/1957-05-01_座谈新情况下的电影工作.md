Symposium on Film Work Under New Circumstances

On April 17th, the editorial department of this newspaper invited thirteen film workers, including Bai Yang, Ying Yunwei, Yan Jizhou, Meng Junmou, Zheng Junli, Xuan Jinglin, Zhang Junxiang, Cui Wei, Shu Xiuwen, Wu Yin, Tang Xiaodan, Qu Baiyin, and Sang Hu, to hold a symposium. They expressed many opinions. Now, based on different issues, their talks are compiled and published as follows.

New Circumstances Generate New Contradictions

Zhang Junxiang:
　　Film work has great achievements but also serious shortcomings. In recent years, the film leadership has been striving for reform. The recent discussions about films have further promoted this reform. Many measures have been taken to decentralize creation and enable staff to play a more active role. However, not all problems can be solved at once. For example, the problem of the backlog of actresses has always been a problem. And after the division of the factory, many new problems have emerged. For example, the contradiction between screenwriters and directors. In the past, screenwriters and directors were forced marriages. Directors had no say in what to film, which was of course not good. Now that free combination is implemented, screenwriters feel that the script has to be approved by the director, and they inevitably have to peddle it everywhere like a hawker, and pass the director's hurdle. Secondly, there is the contradiction between directors and actors. In the past, the leadership's interference in assigning actors had shortcomings; but if the director overemphasized personal preferences, wanting to find whoever they wanted to play (of course, they always looked for people they had seen and were more familiar with, and didn't care about those they were not familiar with), then the problem of actors would not only not be solved but would become more serious. Similarly, if actors overemphasized personal interests, many plays would be left unacted, and production tasks would be affected. Therefore, how to adapt free combination to task planning is still a problem. Also, in the past, screenwriters wrote scripts according to a certain proportion of themes, but now screenwriters don't have to consider the proportion of themes too much and don't feel like they are writing assigned essays. However, it is often inevitable to deal with a certain type of theme in a rush. This will also affect the use of film cadres. For example, the scripts produced by the Shanghai Film Studio this year are all stories about young men and women, so the actresses present here, such as Bai Yang and Shu Xiuwen, have no roles to play, and no one to play these young girls either. Is there still a need for some quick writers who can write plays for a specific actor according to the topic? This is also not without difficulties. In the past, some screenwriters were not afraid of writing essays on topics, because in the past they mostly wrote about the lives of petty-bourgeois intellectuals, which the screenwriters were very familiar with and could handle with ease. Today, screenwriters are not so familiar with the lives of workers, peasants, and soldiers. The capital is not large, like a tailor, there is only such a large piece of material, barely enough to make a jacket, but if you want him to make a wide skirt, how can it be done? The exposure of these new problems mentioned above is good, because once they are exposed, the contradictions can be resolved; once resolved, the film industry can move forward; but how to resolve them still requires further research and discussion.

Regarding the "free market" issue, my view is this. Before liberation, the boundaries between screenwriters and directors were not so clear, and the same was true between film workers and stage workers. Some people engaged in screenwriting also engaged in directing; engaged in films, also engaged in dramas. Now, however, emphasis is placed on staffing, being a screenwriter, being a director, clearly distinguished, just like the post office separates the grids for inserting letters, without any confusion. This may have had some advantages in the past, but in the future, it is not necessary to have such rigid regulations. Everyone can be allowed to develop freely, writing if they want to write, directing if they want to direct. The film bureau leadership may have some concerns, fearing that once people are released, they will not be able to be recovered. In fact, it won't be, for example, people like me will not give up on films. Films have their own charm, and people who fall in love with films will not easily give them up.

Qu Baiyin:
　　Film is an art that relies on collective labor, which inevitably conflicts with creative freedom. For example, if the director wants to find actors from outside, it is unfavorable to the actors in the factory; but if the director is not allowed to find actors from outside, then that is interfering with creative freedom. Similarly, there is also a contradiction between screenwriters and directors. These contradictions cannot be resolved by making regulations, but only on the basis of mutual respect. If screenwriters, directors, and actors respect each other, then when there are actors inside who can play a certain role, the director can go to them to play it; if the role the director is looking for from outside is indeed needed, then the actors will not complain about the director. In addition, can some contradictions also be resolved through the "free market" method, that is to say, screenwriters, directors, and actors from various factories can freely combine, the director of the Shanghai Film Studio can cooperate with the screenwriter of the Beijing Film Studio, and the actor of the Beijing Film Studio can also contact the director of the Changchun Film Studio to make a film at the Changchun Film Studio.

Cui Wei:
　　After the policy of "Letting a hundred flowers bloom, letting a hundred schools of thought contend" was put forward, the contradiction between leaders and the masses—mainly creative cadres—was first revealed in the field of film work. If we admit that film is both artistic creation and industrial production, we can also call it the contradiction between production relations and productive forces. It should be admitted that the Film Bureau and various film studios have some shortcomings in their leadership ideology and leadership style, and even made mistakes in some specific issues. But we oppose the nihilistic view of negating the achievements of film work since liberation, and we also disagree with some extreme opinions that negate leadership, and obliterate the role and achievements of leadership.

Currently, the leadership has taken many active measures in order to thoroughly implement the great policy of "Letting a hundred flowers bloom, letting a hundred schools of thought contend" in film work. A new atmosphere has emerged, and many creative personnel have begun to unleash their potential. Enthusiasm is high, and achievements have been made; but this is only the beginning. In order to make the flowers of film bloom more beautifully and fragrantly, we must resolutely eliminate all restrictive rules and regulations that are not conducive to creation, and let go boldly, in order to realize this beautiful wish.

New contradictions will inevitably arise when old contradictions are resolved. Therefore, we cannot naively imagine that everything will be fine after the leadership lets go.

The process of constantly overcoming contradictions is also the process of our constant development and progress!

Boldly letting go and actively leading should be unified. The implementation of the policy of "Letting a hundred flowers bloom" in film work is also impossible without the active factors of leadership.

Individual extreme ideas should not affect the enthusiasm for strengthening leadership. For example, in terms of themes, everyone is right to oppose assigned essays, but the leadership must clarify the proportion of themes, and then take measures to ensure that the people can obtain the most needed spiritual food. It is right for writers to describe the lives they are most familiar with, but the current situation is also worthy of attention. Many people engaged in film script creation are writing scripts that expose the contradictions of the old society. Of course, exposing the darkness of the old society is also necessary, but it is even more necessary to praise the brightness of the new society. We live in such a great era, we must understand everything in this great era, and we must never use the excuse that we have a deeper experience of the old society to avoid throwing ourselves into the struggle to build a new society. Describing the heroic figures of workers, peasants, and soldiers who promote history and create history should still be the greatest theme.

I don't think it's wrong to have a certain thematic plan. The problem is how to closely combine it with the writer's interests and their personal plans, and guide writers who are familiar with various aspects of life to engage in film script creation. This will ensure a certain proportion of themes.

When the leadership lets go, it must also study the past and look forward to the future, and take a cautious and firm attitude towards all measures. Otherwise, some of the past situations will reappear.

After the policy of "Letting a hundred flowers bloom, letting a hundred schools of thought contend" was implemented in film work, the contradictions between creative personnel were further exposed. I say this to affirm that the contradictions existed in the past, but are now more acute. In the past, there were contradictions between screenwriters and directors, and the contradictions between actors and directors were even more obvious. Currently, we have started the method of decentralizing creation and freely combining. Therefore, the contradiction between screenwriters and directors is not only about different understandings of themes and characters, and disputes over additions and deletions to the original work during the director's re-creation. Free combination, and the past bias in the evaluation of the labor of screenwriters and directors, so although some directors are working with writers they are familiar with, more directors are writing their own scripts. Coupled with creative freedom, directors can reject scripts they don't like, which has created a tense situation between screenwriters and directors. Many screenwriters have begun to worry that their works have no way out, and are considering giving up film script creation. The solution to these contradictions must be through the measures taken by the leadership, such as the basic salary remuneration system, the correct evaluation of the director's re-creation, and mutual respect and trust among creative personnel.

The contradiction between directors and actors has also become more acute in the case of free combination. Of course, we admit that directors have the right to choose actors, and we should not oppose directors borrowing actors from outside, but our directors must proceed from objective reality and further understand and familiarize themselves with our own actors, so that our own actors have priority in playing various roles. If our actors are really not competent for a certain role, and the actors we find from outside are indeed better than us, we should also support this approach. Actors should correct their understanding of this issue, and directors need to clarify their position and role in the field of creation, because currently (and probably in the future as well) only directors can choose actors, while actors find it difficult to choose directors they like.

Some experienced older actors (mainly actresses) must be given arrangements, even though these actors cannot play younger roles due to conditions. However, their valuable life experience and skillful acting skills must be cherished and given full play. The solution to these contradictions requires active measures from the leadership, as well as the correct understanding and support of this issue from directors and writers.

We must not ignore the third contradiction in film work. This is the contradiction between subjective strength and objective needs, that is, the contradiction between the film workers themselves and the demands of the masses. In our great socialist construction, the people's awareness and cultural level have improved, and they will certainly have higher requirements for the most mass-based art of film, which is as it should be; but our cultivation and ability are far from keeping up with their needs and desires. The solution to this contradiction can only rely on our efforts. Currently, the phenomenon of our artistic creation cadres being divorced from politics and life is relatively serious. Personally speaking, after working in administrative work for many years, I feel great difficulty now that I have returned to the position of artistic creation. I am no longer familiar with rural life; I have not participated in the struggle of factory production; living in the city, I don't even understand the situation in the city. Our circle of life is very narrow, which is very dangerous. We must go into life, enrich ourselves, transform ourselves, and improve ourselves, in order to overcome this serious contradiction.

Comrade Shangguan Yunzhu played a strong female soldier in the People's Army in "South Island Storm," and received certain praise. People praised her acting skills, but I think her achievement is more importantly due to her possession of the revolutionary soldier temperament of that head nurse. We can say with certainty that without these years of self-transformation and improvement of ideological understanding, she would not have been able to create such a character.

We must pay attention to and overcome this contradiction, because since describing new heroic figures is our great theme, and for actors, playing new heroes and creating the image of people's heroes should be our greatest topic, we must correctly understand them and have common feelings with them, in order to overcome the contradictions formed by our own conditions and achieve something.

How to train and use actors?

Bai Yang:
　　Since the Shanghai Film Studio changed its organization and the actors were decentralized to the factories, we actors have felt that our responsibility is greater, which is good. But this alone does not mean that the problem of the use and training of actors has been solved. In my opinion, only by letting actors make more films can new actors be trained and old actors be improved. The current situation is that both new and old actors have few opportunities to make films. Just talking about the actors present here, a third of the year has already passed, but none of them have filming tasks. It's not that the factory doesn't make films, but that it doesn't pay enough attention to existing forces when choosing roles. Our factory has many excellent experienced actors and young actors; but many directors always look for new people everywhere when making films. Of course, it is necessary to constantly absorb fresh blood into our team, but we can't ignore the existing forces! What's more, the new people we look for usually only make one film and that's it, and we never look for them again. As a result, the existing forces are not fully used, and new forces are rarely cultivated.

When dealing with experienced actors, there is now a prevailing trend of "respecting the old." People see us in our thirties as if we are seventy or eighty years old, and can only play old people but not young people. Last year, two foreign film directors saw "For Peace" and "Mother" and were greatly surprised when they met me and Zhang Ruifang, saying that you are still young, why do you like to play old people? Yes, foreign film actors are still playing young men at sixty, and still playing young girls at fifty. Age cannot limit artistic life, and will not hinder re-creation. In fact, it is not easier for us to play old people than young people. Just to draw wrinkles on our faces takes several hours, and we still can't avoid being seen through by the audience. I think if the space for actors to create can be widened, actors will not be so restricted.

Young actors should be given more opportunities to practice. If some actors are more suitable for stage performances, then assign them to the theater, which is better than being left in the factory with no plays to act in; however, this should be done according to the principle of combining need and willingness.

Shu Xiuwen:
　　Regarding the use and training of actors, I would like to talk about these opinions: First, the potential of existing actors is very large, and I hope they will be fully used; especially actresses, youth is fleeting, and if they are not trained and used in time, they will not be able to do anything after they get married and have children. This is not good for our entire film industry. Secondly, after the Shanghai Film Studio split into factories, some of our actors participated in stage performances during the filming breaks. This is very good. It is more difficult to train an actor by making films alone, and they must grow up from the stage at the same time. I think it is possible to send actors to factories, rural areas, and amateur or professional drama troupes in various provinces and cities to participate in performance work or guidance work. This will not only discover talents and train talents; but also allow them to be trained and transformed. It is also possible to send experienced actors to professional theaters to participate in theater performances, arranging A and B systems, and returning when there are filming tasks, which does not hinder stage performances.

As for "respecting the old," my view is this. Older actors have some acting experience and a wider range of roles, and can develop in the direction of playing old and middle-aged people. Because it would be more difficult for young actors to play old people; and older actors would be somewhat limited in appearance when playing young people. Of course, this does not mean that experienced actors do not have to play young people, as long as there are suitable roles, they can still play them.

Wu Yin:
　　From the perspective of old actors and actresses, I strongly agree with the opinions of Bai Yang and Shu Xiuwen. Now the old ones are rusting quickly, the young ones haven't grown up, there is a gap between generations, and there is no one to succeed them, which is worrying. It's not that we are not training new people, but we train them one by one, without asking about their foundation or seeing if they have the potential for development, which is not right. In the past, capitalists didn't train actors like this. They wanted to see if it was worth it before investing. Revisiting the old to know the new, some of the methods of using and training actors in the past can still be considered.

In addition, my experience is that the "free market" is a way to "exchange what one has for what one lacks." Various factories open their doors to each other, learn from each other's strengths and make up for each other's weaknesses. If your factory lacks actors to play old people, my factory has them, I'll give them to you. In this way, various factory writers, directors, and actors can become familiar with more actors, which is convenient for finding roles in the future; and actors can also make more films. As for whether they can also freely combine and produce their own films? I think this is more difficult, because it will lead to a series of difficult problems such as venues and machines.

Xuan Jinglin:
　　I entered the Star Film Company to make films at the age of eighteen, and now it has been thirty-two years. In the first year I joined Star, I made six films and played six different roles. In my opinion, it is difficult for a film actor to improve if they only make one film a year and always play the same role. I am now fifty years old and still love the film industry. However, because the leadership takes care of my health on the one hand, and there are few scripts on the other, I can't make films.

Tang Xiaodan:
　　Some of the systems for actor issues in the past can still be absorbed. For example, the contract system, which binds actors and film studios through contracts, is one method. In addition, if the boundaries between actors, directors, and screenwriters are broken, actors can actively find screenwriters to write scripts for themselves, or they can bring scripts to find directors, so that actors may have more opportunities to make films. In the past, when filming films reflecting workers, peasants, and soldiers, some people did have a prejudice, believing that only actors from the old liberated areas could play workers, peasants, and soldiers well. I don't think this is absolute. As long as they can go deep into life, undergo ideological transformation, and improve their understanding, then ordinary actors can also play workers, peasants, and soldiers. For example, Shangguan Yunzhu played Fu Ruohua in "South Island Storm," and Sun Daolin and Qi Heng played Li Lianchang and Wu Laogui in "Crossing the River Reconnaissance," which were very good examples. This also shows that it is necessary for comrades in the old and new areas to work together, learn from each other's strengths, and make up for each other's weaknesses. In short, as long as we eliminate sectarian emotions, some problems can be solved.

Value the Good Experiences of Film Production Management in the Past

Meng Junmou:
　　Unlike other industries before liberation, the Chinese film industry did not have a large amount of investment from national bourgeoisie, so it cultivated a style of hard work and plain living among film workers, and had many good experiences in production management. They were also careful and calculating about the cost of filming. The cost of the upper and lower parts of "A Spring River Flows East" was about 140,000 yuan in current RMB. At that time, such a high cost was already alarming, but now the cost of shooting a film is almost more than 200,000 yuan.

Before liberation, the Shanghai film industry produced about 70 to 100 films a year; but now, if the Shanghai Film Studio only produces 17 films last year, it seems very tight. I think this is related to production management. In the past, the filming work days for filming were generally 50 to 70 days, but now the average filming work days for each film is about 130 days. The extension of filming work days inevitably increases the cost accordingly.

Now various departments are actively responding to the call for increasing production and practicing economy, but the film production department does not seem to have done so, so how to increase output, improve quality, and reduce costs in the film industry are all worth thinking and researching for every film worker.

Improve the Level of Science and Education Films

Meng Junmou:
　　Science and education films are still a young and new type of film in our country, but they play a great educational role. For example, the film "Cultivating Strong Seedlings," which introduces the experience of agricultural labor model Chen Yongkang's rice harvest, improved the harvest after being shown in various places, as farmers learned this advanced experience. In recent years, our country has had many advanced experiences in industry, agriculture, and other aspects. If they can be introduced in time, it will be of great benefit to socialist construction.

The current shortcomings of science and education films are that the output is not large, the level is not high, and the connection with the scientific community and practical business departments is not close enough, which are all things that we urgently need to improve.

In terms of screenwriting and directing of science and education films, I think we should carry out professional division of labor according to categories such as industry, agriculture, and health, so that we can easily study and improve our professional level and film quality.

Opinions and Suggestions on Film Awards

Cui Wei:
　　I think this film award has shortcomings. If a film wins a first prize, the actors in the film also win a first prize, regardless of whether the actor's creation is commensurate with the award they received. In fact, if the whole film is good, not every actor is necessarily good; conversely, if the film is not very good, some actors often have outstanding performances. Now some actors who have achieved results, because their films won second or third prizes, they can only be winners of second or third prizes. This is unreasonable. The motivation for this approach is very good, but the effect is not good and is worth the leadership's consideration.

Sang Hu:
　　I suggest that the People's Daily hold a social film award ceremony once a year in the future, on the one hand to evaluate the overall quality of various films released in the year, and at the same time to set up some award categories, such as the Best Actor Award, the Best Actress Award, the Best Cinematography Award, the Best Art Design Award, etc., which will also be a great encouragement to film workers. Since the People's Daily is a national newspaper with the widest readership, I think it is appropriate for the People's Daily to hold this social award ceremony.

Strengthen Film Reviews and Strengthen the Connection Between Newspapers and Film Industry

Ying Yunwei:
　　In the past, newspapers gave us great help and encouragement. Film workers and journalists have always been inseparable friends. Now there is less contact with each other. I hope that we can still strengthen our connections in the future. Newspapers should not only use a larger space to publish film reviews, but also increase some film news. If our filming news is published in the newspaper, it will be a great encouragement to us.

Zhang Junxiang:
　　In the past, many young comrades wrote film reviews for the Shanghai Liberation Daily, but because the newspaper did not publish them, the number of people writing gradually decreased. And the newspaper always wanted its own opinions to be more correct and complete, so it was unwilling to select and publish general manuscripts. Now the Liberation Daily really wants to engage in film reviews, but it is suffering from not being able to find anyone to write, and sometimes even if someone reluctantly writes, the quality is very poor. I think as long as it should be done, it doesn't matter if it's a little worse at the beginning. Start from someone writing to gradually improve the quality and expand the team. On the other hand, we should also find some experienced and knowledgeable people to write. I have a suggestion like this. Can the newspaper invite a few senior writers to be responsible for a special column and regularly express their opinions on some films?

Zheng Junli:
　　In the past, the relationship between journalists and film workers was very close, but now this relationship seems to have been interrupted, which is a pity. In the future, the film censorship system will be abolished, and the quality of the film will depend on social public opinion, that is, this responsibility will be handed over to the newspaper. I hope that the newspaper can take on this task. In addition, some more specialized issues, such as the relationship between film and literature, that is, how film should contact literary workers, I hope the newspaper can also talk about it, because many young literary and art workers want to approach film, but don't know what to do.

Wu Yin:
　　Newspapers should also do some publicity for actors. The success of an actor depends not only on the correct use of him by the leadership and his own efforts, but also on the publicity of the newspaper. In the past, some newspapers also asked us actors to write articles, but it is always a bit inconvenient for us to write about ourselves; I still hope that reporters can become one with our actors, communicate closely, and give us more help.

Sang Hu:
　　The People's Daily can organize the publication of review articles with different opinions, so that the page can be lively and avoid being considered as drawing conclusions.

Tang Xiaodan:
　　In the past, some newspapers had daily films, but now we might as well start with weekly films. Increasing film reviews will also be beneficial to the implementation of the policy of "Letting a hundred flowers bloom, letting a hundred schools of thought contend" in the film industry in the future.

Qu Baiyin:
　　There is a method for film review work to be done by newspapers inviting special people; but it can also be published in the form of joint names of three or five people.

Cui Wei:
　　After the policy of "Letting a hundred flowers bloom, letting a hundred schools of thought contend" was put forward, some people were worried that the world would be in chaos, but there is no need to worry. After letting go, there may be some small deviations, but the basic situation will be healthy. Social public opinion can help us distinguish right from wrong. In this regard, newspapers and magazines can be said to be a very important base. Newspapers should use film and drama reviews to spur film and drama. Comments in the newspaper should not be regarded as conclusions, and articles with different opinions can be published for discussion. For example, some people say "Tiger Tally" is good, and some say it is not good; there are also two different opinions on "The Story Not Yet Finished" in the Soviet Union. We can all publish articles with different opinions on these. Now general film reviews only talk about the script, not about the director and actors (or just say a few simple words at the end); and foreign films are all said to be good, this situation should be changed.

### 座谈新情况下的电影工作

专栏：

    座谈新情况下的电影工作
    4月17日，本报编辑部邀请白  杨、应云卫、严寄洲、孟君谋、郑君里、宣景琳、张骏祥、崔  嵬、舒绣文、吴  茵、汤晓丹、瞿白音、桑  弧等十三位电影工作者举行座谈会。他们发表了许多意见。现在根据不同的问题，将他们的谈话整理发表如后。
    新情况产生新矛盾
    张骏祥：
    电影工作有很大成绩也有严重的缺点。年来电影领导方面正力求改革。最近关于电影的讨论更促进了这一改革。目前已采取许多措施，使创作下放，使工作人员的积极性得以发挥。但不是一切问题一下子就都可以解决的，譬如女演员的积压问题就始终是一个问题。而分厂以后，又出现了很多新问题。譬如编剧和导演的矛盾。过去编剧和导演是强迫婚姻。导演对拍什么戏无发言权，这当然不好，现在实行自由结合，编剧又觉得剧本要导演点头，不免要像挑货郎担的到处兜售，要过导演的关了。其次是导演和演员的矛盾。过去领导干涉分派演员，是有缺点的；但如果导演过分强调了个人的喜爱，想找谁演就找谁演（当然他总是找他所见过的、比较熟悉的人来演的，而对他所不熟悉的人就不过问了），这样一来，演员的问题不但没有解决反而更严重了。同样地，演员过分强调个人兴趣，许多戏无人愿意演，生产任务就受影响。所以，自由结合与任务计划怎样适应，还存在许多问题。还有，过去编剧是按照一定的题材比例写剧本，现在编剧不必过多考虑题材比例，不感到是出题作文了。可是又常常难免一窝蜂处理一类题材。这样，也会影响到电影干部的使用问题。例如上海电影制片厂今年出的剧本都是写青年小伙子、小姑娘的故事的，因此在座的几位女演员如白杨、舒绣文等同志也就没有戏演，而这些小姑娘又没有人演。是否还需要几个快手，能按题目为某个特定演员写戏的编剧呢？这也不无困难。从前有些编剧是不怕出题目做文章的，因为过去写的多半是小资产阶级知识分子的生活，编剧熟悉得很，可以左右逢源。今天编剧对于工农兵生活就不是那么熟悉了。本钱不大，好比裁缝师父，只有那么大一块料子，勉勉强强裁件褂子还可以，你一定要他做宽幅裙子，那怎么能行呢？以上谈到的这些新问题暴露出来是好的，因为暴露出了，矛盾就可以解决；解决了，电影事业就可以前进一步；但如何解决，还需要进一步研究讨论。
    关于“自由市场”问题，我的看法是这样。解放以前编剧、导演之间界限划分得不是那么清楚的，电影工作者和舞台工作者之间也是这样。有些人搞编剧，也搞导演；搞电影，也搞话剧。现在则讲究编制，是编剧，是导演，分得清清楚楚，就像邮局分格插信一样，一丝也错乱不得。过去这样做可能有一些好处，今后则可以不必这样死规定了。可以让大家自由发展，愿编就编，愿导就导。电影局领导方面可能有些顾虑，怕把人放出去了收不回来。其实不会的，譬如我这样的人，就不会放弃电影。电影自有其迷人之处，爱上了电影的人，是不会轻易放弃它的。
    瞿白音：
    电影是依靠集体劳动的艺术，这和创作自由不免就有矛盾。譬如导演要外找演员，这对本厂的演员来说是不利的；但是如果不允许导演外找演员，那就是干涉创作自由了。同样的编剧和导演之间也有矛盾。这些矛盾是不能靠订条例来解决的，只有在大家互相尊重的基础上来解决。如果编、导、演互相尊重，那么内部有演员可以担任某个角色时，导演就可去找他来扮演；导演如果外找的角色确实需要，则演员也不会埋怨导演了。另外有些矛盾是否也可以通过“自由市场”的办法来解决，就是说各个厂的编、导、演可以自由结合，上海电影制片厂的导演可以和北京电影制片厂编剧合作，北京电影制片厂的演员，也可跟长春电影制片厂导演联系到长春电影制片厂拍戏。
    崔嵬：
    百花齐放、百家争鸣的方针提出后，在电影工作领域内，首先揭开了领导和群众——主要是创作干部之间的矛盾。如果承认电影既是艺术创造又是工业生产，也可以谓之生产关系和生产力的矛盾。应当承认，电影局和各个制片厂不管在领导思想和领导作风上，都存在着一些缺点，甚至在某些具体问题上发生过错误。但我们反对否定解放以来电影工作的成绩的虚无主义的观点，我们也不同意否定领导，抹杀领导的作用和成绩的一些偏激的意见。
    目前领导上已经采取了许多积极的措施，以期使“百花齐放、百家争鸣”这一伟大方针能够在电影工作中彻底实现。新的气象已经出现，许多创作人员已经开始发挥自己的潜力。积极性很高，而且已经作出了成绩；但这仅仅是开始，要想使电影之花开的更美更香，还必须坚决清除一切不利于创作的清规戒律，大胆放手，才能使这种美好的愿望实现。
    旧的矛盾解决了，一定还会出现新的矛盾。因此我们不能天真地设想，领导放手后，就会万事大吉。
    不断地克服矛盾的过程，也就是我们不断地发展和进步的过程！
    大胆放手和积极领导应当统一起来。“百花齐放”的方针在电影工作中贯彻，缺少领导的积极因素，也是不可能的。
    个别偏激的想法，不应当影响加强领导的积极性。譬如题材方面，大家反对出题作文是对的，但领导对题材的比重必须明确，然后采取措施，保证人民能够获得最需要的精神食粮。作家描写自己所最熟悉的生活是对的，但目前出现的情况，却也值得注意。许多从事电影剧本创作的人，都写的是揭露旧社会的矛盾的剧本。当然暴露旧社会的黑暗也是必要的，但歌颂新社会的光明则更必要。我们生活在这样伟大的时代，就必须去理解这个伟大时代的一切，决不能借口我们对旧社会有较深的体验，就不必再投身于建设新社会的斗争。描写推动历史、创造历史的工农兵的英雄人物，应当还是最伟大的主题。
    我认为有一定的主题计划并不错误，问题是在于如何与作家的兴趣及其个人的计划密切结合，并引导熟悉各种生活的作家，从事电影剧本的创作。这样就可以保证题材的一定的比例。
    领导放手，还必须研究过去和远瞩未来，对于一切措施采取慎重和坚决的态度。否则还将出现过去的一些情况。
    “百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，贯彻到电影工作中后，更加暴露了创作人员之间的矛盾。我这样说，就是肯定矛盾过去已经存在着的，而目前更加尖锐了。过去编剧和导演有矛盾，演员和导演的矛盾则更加明显。目前我们已经开始了创作下放、自由结合的办法。因此编剧和导演的矛盾已经不仅是对主题、人物不同的理解，以及导演再创造时对于原作增添和减少的争执了。自由结合，以及过去对编剧和导演所付出的劳动估价有偏差，因而虽然有些导演在和自己熟悉的作家合作，而更多的是导演在自己写作剧本。再加上创作自由，导演可以拒绝自己所不喜欢的剧本，这样就形成了编导之间的紧张状态，许多编剧已经开始担心自己的作品没有出路，并考虑到放弃电影剧本的创作。这些矛盾的解决，必须通过领导所采取的措施，如基薪酬劳制度，对导演再创造的正确的估价，以及创作人员相互尊重和信任等。
    导演和演员的矛盾，在自由结合的情况下也出现了更尖锐的情况。当然我们承认导演有选择演员的权利，我们也不应当反对导演到外面借用演员，但我们的导演必须从客观实际出发，进一步地了解和熟悉我们自己的演员，使我们自己的演员有扮演各种角色的优先权。如果我们的演员对于某个角色实在不能胜任，而且外找的演员的确比我们好，我们也应当赞成这种作法。演员应当端正对于这个问题的认识，而导演对于这个问题更需要明确自己在创作领域的地位和作用，因为目前（将来恐怕也是这样）只有导演可以选择演员，而演员则难以挑选自己所喜欢的导演。
    对于一些有经验的年龄较大的演员（主要是女演员）则必须给以安排，虽然这些演员因为条件的限制不能扮演更年青的角色。但是他们的可贵的生活经验和熟练的演技，一定要珍视并给以充分发挥的机会。这些矛盾的解决，需要领导的积极措施，也需要导演和剧作者对于这个问题的正确的认识和支持。
    我们决不能忽略电影工作中的第三个矛盾。这就是主观力量和客观需要，也就是电影工作者本身和群众要求的矛盾。在我们伟大的社会主义建设中，人民的觉悟和文化水平提高了，他们对于最有群众基础的电影艺术，一定会有更高的要求，这是应当的；但我们的修养和能力还远不能赶上他们的需要和愿望。这个矛盾的解决，只有依靠我们的努力。目前我们艺术创作干部，脱离政治、脱离生活的现象，是比较严重的。以我个人来讲，作了很多年的行政工作，现在转回艺术创作的阵地，就感到很大的困难。农村生活不熟识了；工厂的生产斗争未曾参加；住在城市，连城市的情况也是不了解的。我们的生活圈子非常狭小，这是非常危险的。我们必须到生活中去，丰富自己，改造自己，提高自己，才有可能克服这个严重的矛盾。
    上官云珠同志在“南岛风云”中饰演一个人民军队中的坚强的女战士，得到一定的好评，人们称赞她的演技，但是我以为她的成就更重要的却是具备了那个女护士长的革命战士的气质。我们可以肯定的说，没有这几年的自我改造和思想认识的提高，她是不可能塑造出这样的人物的。
    我们必须重视和克服这个矛盾，因为既然描写新的英雄人物是我们伟大的主题，在演员来讲，扮演新的英雄，创造人民英雄的形象应当是我们最伟大的课题，我们就必须正确地理解他，并和他们具有共同的感受，才有可能克服因为我们本身的条件而形成的矛盾而有所成就。
    如何培养和使用演员？
    白杨：
    自从上海电影制片厂变动机构，演员分散下厂以后，我们演员都觉得自己责任更大了，这是好的。但仅仅这样不等于就解决了演员的使用和培养问题。我看，只有叫演员多拍片子，才能使新演员得到培养，使老演员得到提高。现在的情况是，无论新老演员都很少拍片机会。就说在座的几位演员吧，今年已经过去三分之一的日子了，却都还没有拍片任务。不是厂里不拍片子，而是在选择角色时不够重视现有力量。我们厂拥有不少优秀的有经验的演员和青年演员；但不少导演拍片时总要四处物色新人。当然，不断吸收新鲜的血液到我们的队伍里来是需要的，但总不能无视现有的力量啊！何况，物色来的新人，一般也只拍一部片子就算了，从此不再找人家。结果，现存力量既没有充分使用，新的力量也很少培养出来。
    对待有经验的演员，现在流行着一股“尊老”的风气。把我们三十多岁的人都看作七老八十的，只能演老年人不能演年青人了。去年两位外国电影导演看过“为了和平”和“母亲”后碰到我和张瑞芳时大为惊讶，说你们原来都还年轻，为什么喜欢演老人呢？是啊，人家外国电影演员六十岁了还演小生，五十岁了还演小姑娘。年龄是不能限制艺术生命，是不会妨害再创造的。事实上，我们演老年人并不比演青年人省事，单是为了要在脸上划出皱纹来，就得花好几小时，结果还免不了被观众看出破绽。我想如果能把演员创造的天地放得宽些，演员就不会这样受限制了。
    青年演员应该让他们有更多实践的机会。如果有的演员更适合于舞台演出，那就把他分配到剧院去，这样总比搁在厂里没有戏演要好些；不过这应该按照需要和自愿相结合的原则来办。
    舒绣文：
    关于演员的使用和培养问题，我再谈这样一些意见：第一，现有演员的潜力很大，希望充分使用；尤其是女演员，青春易逝，如果不及时地培养和使用，一结婚，一生孩子，就更做不了什么事了。这样对我们整个电影事业并没有好处。其次，上海电影制片厂分厂以后，我们有些演员乘拍片的空隙参加舞台演出。这很好。一个演员，单靠拍片培养是比较困难的，必须同时从舞台上来成长。我想不妨把演员下放到工厂、农村和各省市的业余或专业剧团去，参加演出工作或辅导工作。这样，不但可以发掘人材，培养人材；也可以使自己得到锻炼和改造。还可以把有经验的演员放到专业剧院去，参加剧院演出，排A、B制，有拍片任务时再回来，也不妨害舞台演出。
    至于“尊老”，我的看法是这样的。年龄较大的演员，有一些演剧经验，戏路也比较宽，是可以向演老年、中年的道路发展的。因为如果让青年演员扮演老年人更会感到困难；而年龄较大的演员扮演年青人在外形上也会受到一定的限制。当然，这并不是说有经验的演员不必去演年青人了，只要有合适的角色，还是可以演的。
    吴茵：
    我站在老演员、女演员的角度，很同意白杨、舒绣文两位的意见。如今老的快锈了，小的没起来，青黄不接，后继无人，令人着急。不是不在培养新人，但是来一个培养一个，不问他基础，不看他有没有发展前途，这是要不得的。从前资本家培养演员倒不这样。他要看值得不值得，再下本钱。温故而知新，如何使用、培养演员，过去有些办法还是可以考虑的。
    此外，我的体会是“自由市场”就是“互通有无”的办法。各厂相互开门，取长补短，你厂里缺演老人的，我厂里有，给你。这样，可以使各厂编、导熟悉更多的演员，便于今后找角色；演员也可以拍到更多的片子。至于是不是也可以自由结合、自己制片呢？我想这比较困难，因为会发生场地、机器等一连串很难解决的问题。
    宣景琳：
    我打十八岁入明星公司拍片子，到现在已经三十二年了。头一年进明星就拍了六部，演了六个不同的角色。我以为，一个电影演员一年只拍一部片，老演一种角色，是很难提高的。我现在五十岁了，仍旧热爱电影事业。可是由于一方面领导上照顾我健康，一方面剧本少，我拍不上片子了。
    汤晓丹：
    演员问题，过去有些制度还可吸收。譬如合同制，通过合同把演员和制片厂约制起来，就是一个办法。此外，演员、导演、编剧之间的界限如果打破了，演员可以主动找编剧为自己写剧本，也可以带剧本找导演，这样演员就可能有更多的机会拍戏。过去拍摄反映工农兵的影片时，有些人确有一种偏见，认为只有老区的演员才能演好工农兵，我觉得这不是绝对的，只要能够深入生活，经过思想改造，认识上提高了，那么一般演员也能演工农兵的。比如上官云珠演“南岛风云”中的符若华，孙道临、齐衡演“渡江侦察记”中的李连长、吴老贵演得很好就是例子。这也说明，老区和新区的同志通力合作、取长补短是很必要的。总之，只要排除宗派主义情绪，有些问题就可得到解决。
    重视过去电影生产管理的好经验
    孟君谋：
    解放前中国电影事业和其它工业不一样，没有民族资产阶级的大量投资，因此养成了电影工作者艰苦朴素的作风，在生产管理上有着很多好经验，对摄制影片的成本，也都是精打细算的。“一江春水向东流”上下两集的成本，折合现在人民币约十四万元。在当时这样高的成本已经骇人听闻，而现在我们拍摄一部影片的成本，差不多都在二十万元以上。
    解放以前，上海电影界一年的影片产量约在七十到一百部之间；而现在如上海电影制片厂去年只生产十七部影片就显得非常紧张。我觉得这和生产管理上是有关系的。过去拍片的摄制工作日一般是五十到七十天，现在每部影片的摄制工作日平均约一百三十天。摄制工作日延长，成本就必然相应提高了。
    现在各个部门都积极响应增产节约的号召，可是电影生产部门似乎还没有这样做，因此在电影事业方面，如何增加产量，提高质量，降低成本，都是值得我们每一个电影工作者思考和研究的。
    提高科学教育片的水平
    孟君谋：
    科学教育片在我国还是一个年轻的、新的片种，但是它所起的教育作用很大。如介绍农业劳动模范陈永康水稻丰收经验的影片“培育壮秧”在各地放映后，农民兄弟学习了这个先进经验，就提高了收成。我国这几年来在工业、农业和其它方面的先进经验很多，如果能够及时介绍，对社会主义建设的好处很大。
    科学教育片现在存在的缺点是产量不多，水平不高，同时和科学界以及实际业务部门的联系也还不够密切，这些都是我们亟待改善的。
    在科学教育片的编、导方面，我认为应该按照工业、农业、卫生等等的类别进行专业分工，这样才能便于钻研，提高业务水平和影片质量。
    对电影评奖的意见和建议
    崔嵬：
    我认为这次优秀影片评奖是有缺点的。影片得一等奖，片中的演员也都是一等奖，至于演员的创作是否和他得到的奖励相称，就不管了。实际上整个影片好，不一定每个演员都好；反之影片不很好，常常有一些演员却有突出的表演。现在是有些有成绩的演员，因为他们的片子得二等或者三等奖，他们也就只能是二等或三等奖的获得者了。这是不合理的，这种作法动机是很好的，但效果却不佳，值得领导上很好的考虑。
    桑弧：
    我建议人民日报今后可每年举行一次社会性质的影片评奖，一方面就该年度所上映各种影片的总的质量进行评选，同时分门别类地设立一些奖励的项目，例如最佳男演员奖、最佳女演员奖、最佳摄影奖、最佳美术设计奖等等，这对电影工作者也将是很大的鼓励。由于人民日报是拥有最广大读者的全国性报纸，我觉得由人民日报来举办这种社会评奖是合适的。
    加强电影评论，密切报刊和电影界的联系
    应云卫：
    过去报纸曾经给我们很大的帮助和鼓励，电影工作者和新闻工作者是从来不离开的朋友，现在彼此的接触少了，希望今后仍能加强联系。报纸不但应该以更大的园地来发表影评，电影消息也应该增多一些。如果报上登了我们拍片的消息，那对我们将是极大的鼓舞。
    张骏祥：
    过去有很多青年同志跟上海解放日报写影评，因为报纸不登，写的人就逐渐少了。而报纸呢则总想自己的言论能更正确更完备一些，因此不愿意选登一般的稿件。现在解放日报虽然很想搞影评，却苦于找不到人写，有时即或有人勉强写出来了，质量也很差。我想只要是应该搞的，开头差一点也不妨。先从有人写到慢慢提高质量，扩大队伍。另一方面，也应该找些有经验、有研究的人来写。我有一个这样的建议，报纸是否可以约几位前辈作家负责一个专栏，经常对一些影片发表意见。
    郑君里：
    过去新闻工作者和电影工作者的关系非常密切，现在这种关系似乎中断了，这是很可惜的。今后电影的审查制度取消了，影片的好坏要靠社会舆论来评价，也就是把这个责任交给报纸了，希望报纸能够担负起这个任务。此外有些比较专门的问题，如电影与文学的关系，也就是电影如何与文学工作者发生联系的问题，希望报纸也能谈谈，因为许多青年文艺工作者很想接近电影，但是不知道该怎么办。
    吴茵：
    报纸也应该为演员作些宣传。演员能够成名，除了领导上对他的正确使用，自己的努力等因素外，报纸对他的宣传也是很重要的。过去也有报纸约我们演员写文章，但是自己写自己总有些不方便；还是希望记者能和我们演员打成一片，息息相通，更多地给我们一些帮助。
    桑弧：
    人民日报可以组织一些不同意见的评论文章发表，这样可以使版面活泼，也可以避免被人认为是在做结论。
    汤晓丹：
    过去有些报纸有每日电影，现在我们不妨先从每周电影搞起。电影评论增多，对于今后在电影事业中贯彻“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针也有好处。
    瞿白音：
    影评工作，由报纸约专人搞，是一种办法；但也可以采取三、五人联名的形式发表。
    崔嵬：
    “百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针提出以后，有人担心会天下大乱，其实大可不必。放手以后，可能会出一些小偏差，但基本情况会是健康的。社会舆论可以帮助我们辨别是非，在这方面，报章杂志可说是个很重要的基地。报纸应该通过影剧评论对电影戏剧进行鞭策。见报的评论不必视为结论，可以发表不同意见的文章进行讨论。譬如“虎符”的演出有人说好，有人说不好；“没有说完的故事”苏联也有两种不同的意见。这些我们都可发表不同意见的文章。现在一般的影评都只谈剧本，不谈导演和演员（或者只在末尾简单说几句）；对于外国电影也是一律说好，这种情况应该改变。
