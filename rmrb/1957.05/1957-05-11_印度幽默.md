    Indian Humor
    A painter publicly exhibited one of his works. He said to the audience:
   “Gentlemen, in this painting, a cow is depicted eating grass in a meadow.”
   “Where is the grass?” the audience asked.
   “The cow ate it all.”
   “Where is the cow then?”　“It has already left. It ate all the grass, why would it stay here?”
          (Selected and translated by Zhang Guangqi)

    印度幽默
    一位画家公开展览自己的一幅作品，他对观众说：
   “先生们，在这幅画上，描绘着一头在草地上吃草的乳牛。”
   “草在哪儿？”观众问。
   “乳牛把它吃光了。”
   “乳牛又在哪儿呢？”　“它已经走了，草都吃光了，它干么还留在这儿？”
          （张光启选译）
