Old Workers Suggest Establishing a New Apprenticeship System

    This newspaper recently held two symposiums with ten veteran workers from five units, including machinery, textiles, construction, and transportation. At the meetings, they made many criticisms and suggestions on the current apprenticeship training system.

    High Rank, Low Skill

    The old workers reflected: Veteran workers who had suffered in the old society felt infinitely excited to see a large number of lively, intelligent, and educated young people joining their ranks. However, the current technical level of many new workers is not commensurate with their rank. Ma Kuiwu from the First Automobile Accessories Factory said: "After I completed my apprenticeship, I could make more refined things like large lead screws, punches, crankshafts, large copper tiles, and figure-eight transmissions. However, the workers who are trained in a short period of time now are given a third-grade rating, but in reality, they can only do a part of the rough work of a third-grade worker. A group of new workers trained by our factory on behalf of the Changchun First Automobile Factory are nominally third-grade workers, but after arriving at their work posts, they still have to be led by third-grade workers." Ma Jun from the Agricultural Machinery Factory said: Some new workers are fine under normal operation, but once a problem occurs, they "can't handle it"; at the same time, because they are not skilled enough in their operations and do not master the performance of the machines, it also affects the quality of the products. Taking the tool workshop of the Agricultural Machinery Factory as an example, more than 80%-90% of the repairs and scrapped work each month are done by new workers. One young worker who graduated from a technical school and received a fourth-grade wage broke the tap while doing ordinary "tapping" work. Tong Jinmei from the No. 2 State Cotton Factory said: "After a group of new workers arrived at their work posts in our factory, they couldn't even distinguish what kind of yarn it was, and the old workers had to teach them on the spot. The workshop directors, deputy directors, and instructors were so anxious that they had no choice but to help themselves. In the C shift of the yarn spinning team, most of the twelve new workers failed to meet the quality requirements." Qu Meifang said: Because new workers have not mastered the basic operations well, advanced experience is difficult to promote. Qin Shuying said: "There is a new worker in our workshop named Sun Qinglan who is down-to-earth and relatively humble, but because of the short learning time and unskilled techniques, she doesn't know how to handle it when the car is abnormal, and she often can't take care of everything. We are worried for her, and she herself feels embarrassed."

    Old Workers' Worries

    The old workers also reflected that many workers not only have technical levels that do not meet national requirements, but also have relatively low political and ideological awareness. Ma Jun said: Some young workers in our factory have lax labor discipline and have not established a sense of honor in labor. One twenty-year-old young worker, who had just graduated from a technical school and was soon rated as a fourth-grade worker, had a very high salary, but he did not work hard. He wandered around the workshop during work hours, did not obey orders, and often quarreled with others. After work, he quickly cleaned himself up and went on dates. Recently, this young man got married and became even more outrageous. He broke out in a cold sweat as soon as he started working, and asked for either personal leave or "sick leave" to accompany his wife. When others made suggestions to him, he said, "I'm not taking your money, so what's it to you?" Qu Meifang said: Some young workers in our factory pay too much attention to enjoying life. What often goes through their minds is comparing their clothes and demanding better treatment. They make one request after another to the leaders. Some people don't take their wages home after they are paid but go to buy leather shoes and watches first. When they don't have money, they seek relief from the trade union. Qin Shuying said: Some people complain about their low wages, saying that the wages she earns are not even enough for the vinegar her family eats. One young worker only worked four days a week for the first four months of this year, constantly asking for "sick leave" and constantly asking the leaders to reduce her workload. Lu Shilin, a 56-year-old veteran driver from Fengtai Locomotive Depot, said: I have brought several apprentices, and I treat them like my own children. However, some apprentices don't respect me enough. One such apprentice called me "Master Lu" when he couldn't do anything at first. After he learned some skills, he called me "Old Lu" to my face and "Old Man Lu" behind my back. Tong Jinmei said: Some young workers in our factory do not cherish public property very much, as if defective products have nothing to do with them. At the same time, they don't know how to be grateful. I often think like this: How much money has the state spent to cultivate new young technical forces; but some of them don't care at all and rarely think about how much they have contributed to the country. I'm really worried. How dangerous it would be to continue like this!

    Superiors Subjective, Subordinates Careless

    The old workers unanimously believe that the above shortcomings are mainly due to the lack of political and ideological education; it is also inseparable from the subjectivism of the leadership. Ma Jun said: It is not easy to train a novice into a skilled technician, but the ministry requires that they reach the level of a third-grade technician in one year. Therefore, the bureau allocates it to the factory, the factory allocates it to the workshop, and the workshop allocates it to the workers, "implementing" it layer by layer, requiring us to complete it in a rush. We, as masters, know that it won't work, but we try our best to "complete the task." Therefore, some masters count the defective and waste products made by the apprentices as their own, and some masters even take their own excellent finished products to the workshop cadres and boast about them as the finished products of the apprentices; the examinations when the apprentices graduate are also not serious, some only examine one or two items, and some only check the production registration form and a few people comment on it. In this way, after some publicity, from top to bottom, it is muddled through and considered graduated.

    Seedlings in a Greenhouse Cannot Withstand Wind and Frost

    The old workers reflected: The country will need a large number of technical workers in the future, but technical workers cannot be trained in this way. There is an urgent need to establish a new and reasonable system. Tong Jinmei said: The apprenticeship system in the old society was very cruel in oppressing and exploiting apprentices; I learned my own skills from the age of nine under the beatings and scoldings of the foreman. Only those who have suffered can more deeply appreciate the sweetness of the new society. Therefore, generally speaking, old workers are not afraid of hardship and fatigue. She suggested that when the state formulates a new apprenticeship system, it should set a longer learning time and lower wages for apprentices, so that young apprentices have the opportunity to hone their skills. Ma Jun said: When I was an apprentice, I suffered from the exploitation of the capitalists, could not get enough to eat, could not keep warm, and was often beaten and abused. The master was unwilling to teach you skills. In order to learn skills, I secretly "stole" the skills during the day, watching how the master operated, and the apprentices studied together at night. After so many difficulties, I was able to learn my skills to this level. Therefore, I advocate not only changing the current apprenticeship system, but also not upgrading new workers too quickly. I say this not because I want all young workers to go through the life of being beaten and abused again, but to say that to learn real skills, one must go through years of diligent study and hard practice, and pass strict examinations to prove that they have real skills before they can be useful. Otherwise, they may be like seedlings in a greenhouse that cannot withstand any wind and frost. Qu Meifang said: The current apprenticeship system is a system that encourages young people not to practice well. When the state considers establishing a new apprenticeship system, it should appropriately extend the time and appropriately lower the wages. Doing so has many benefits, not only will it urge young people to work hard to improve their skills, but more importantly, it can enable young people to establish good work habits and receive ideological training.

### 老工人建议建立新的学徒制度

    老工人建议建立新的学徒制度
    本报讯　本报最近先后召开了两次有机械、纺织、建筑、交通运输等五个单位的十位老工人参加的座谈会。会上他（她）们对现行学徒工培训制度提出了许多批评和建议。
    等级高，本领低
    老工人们反映：吃尽了旧社会苦头的老工人，看到大批活泼聪明、有文化的青年到自己队伍中来，感到无限的兴奋。但是，目前很多新工人的技术水平，和他们的级别是不相称的。第一汽车附件厂马奎武说：“我满师后，可以作大丝杠、冲床、曲轴、大铜瓦和八字输等较精细的活。而现在短时期培养出来的工人定的是三级工，实际上只能做三级工的一部分粗活。我们厂代长春第一汽车厂培训的一批新工人，名义上已是三级工，可是到了工作岗位以后，还得要三级工去带。”农业机械厂马俊说：有些新工人在正常操作的情况下还可以，但是一旦发生了问题就“玩不转”了；同时由于他们操作不够熟练，对机器的性能掌握不了也影响了产品的质量。就以农业机械厂的工具车间来说，每月退修报废的活，有80％—90％以上都是新工人作出来的。有一位从技工学校毕业的青工，拿的是四级工资，可是作普通的“套扣”工作时，还把丝锥给弄断了。国棉二厂童金妹说：“我们工厂有一批新工人到了工作岗位以后，连什么纱都分不清楚，还得由老工人现教。工长副工长和教练员急得没有办法，就自己下手帮助。拈线丙班有一个工区，十二个新工人大部分完不成质量要求。”曲美芳说：由于新工人基本操作都没有掌握好，先进经验很难推广。秦淑英说：“我们车间有个新工人叫孙清兰，工作踏实，也比较虚心，但是因为学习时间短，技术不熟练，遇到车子不正常，就不知道怎样掌握，常常顾得东顾不了西。我们替她着急，她自己也感觉为难。”
    老工人的忧虑
    老工人还反映：有许多工人，不但技术水平不合乎国家要求，政治思想觉悟也是比较低的。马俊说：我们厂里有一部分青年工人，劳动纪律很松懈，没有树立起劳动的光荣感。有一个二十岁的青年工人，刚从技工学校毕业出来不久就定为四级工，待遇很高，可是他不好好干活，上班的时候在车间里溜跶，不听从指挥，动不动就跟别人吵嘴。下班后就赶快收拾得干干净净去谈恋爱。最近这个青年结了婚，更不像话了，上班一干活就出虚汗，不是请事假就是请“病假”，陪着爱人玩。别人向他提意见，他说：“老子不是领你的钱，你管的着吗？”曲美芳说：我们厂里有些青年工人太注意生活享受，她们经常在脑子里打转的是比穿戴，闹待遇，一个又一个向领导上提要求，有的人发了工资不往家中拿，先去买皮鞋、买手表，没有钱的时候就找工会救济。秦淑英说：有的人一提起工资就嫌少，说她挣的工资还没有她家中吃的醋钱多呢。有一个青年工人，今年头四个月每星期只上四天班，三天两头请“病假”，动不动就向领导上要求减轻她的工作。今年五十六岁的丰台机务段老司机鹿士林说：我带了好几个徒弟，都是把他们当成自己的孩子一样看待，可是，有的徒弟对我却不够尊重。有这样一个徒弟，起初他什么都不行的时候就叫我“鹿师傅”，学会了点技术，当着面就叫我“老鹿”，背着面就叫我“鹿老头子”了。童金妹说：我们厂有些青年工人对于公共财产很不爱护，好像出了次品和她们没有关系。同时，她们也不知道饮水思源。我常常这样想：国家为了培养新生的青年技术力量，花了多少钱；可是她们当中有些人偏偏满不在乎，很少想一想自己对国家有多少贡献。我真是耽心。这样下去多么危险呵！
    上面主观，下面马虎
    老工人们一致认为，上述缺点，主要是缺乏政治思想教育所致；也和领导上的主观主义分不开。马俊说：从一个生手培养成一个熟练的技工，是不容易的，可是部里要求一年就要达到三级技工的水平。于是，局里分配给厂里，厂里分配给车间，车间就分配到工人头上，一层一层往下“贯彻”，要求我们突击完成。我们作师傅的明明知道不成，也千方百计来“完成任务”。于是有的师傅把学徒做的次品、废品算在自己的头上，有的师傅甚至把自己的优良成品拿到车间干部面前，当成学徒的成品吹嘘一番；在学徒出师的时候考试也不认真，有的只考试一样两样，有的只查一查生产登记表，几个人评议一下。就这样三宣传两宣传，从上到下，胡胡弄弄的就算毕了业。
    暖房里的幼苗经不起风霜
    老工人们反映：国家今后需要大批技术工人，但是不能这样培养技术工人。目前迫切需要建立一种新的合理的制度。童金妹说：旧社会的学徒制度对学徒的压迫剥削是很残酷的；我自己的技术就是从九岁开始在把头的打骂下学出来的。只有吃尽了苦头的人，才更深刻地体会新社会的甜头。所以一般老工人都不怕苦，不怕累。她建议，国家在制定新学徒制度的时候，应该把学徒学习时间订得长些，待遇低些，使青年学徒都有磨练的机会。马俊说：我在当学徒的时候，受尽了资本家的剥削，吃不饱，穿不暖，经常挨打受气，师傅还不肯教你手艺。我为了学手艺，白天留心“偷艺”，看师傅怎样操作，晚上几个师兄弟在一起研究。经过多少艰难，我的技术才能学到现在这个样子。所以我主张不仅要改变现在的学徒制度，而且新工人升级也不能过快。我这么说，并不是要求所有青年工人都再过挨打受气的生活，而是说，要学到真本领，必须经过多年的勤学苦练，经过严格的考试，证明有了真本领才能顶事。不然他们就可能像暖房里的幼苗经不起任何风霜。曲美芳说：现在的学徒制度是鼓励青年不练好的制度。国家在考虑建立新的学徒制度时，应当把时间适当延长一些，待遇适当降低一些。这样做有很多好处，不仅会促使青年努力提高技术，更重要的是可以使青年树立良好的劳动习惯，思想上得到锻炼。
