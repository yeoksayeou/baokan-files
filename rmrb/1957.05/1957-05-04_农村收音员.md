    Rural Radio Operator
    Ding Mang
    Zhang Runlin became the village's radio operator after returning from the army. Every evening, he carried the radio to various residential areas. At first, he had to invite people three or four times before he could gather a dozen listeners. Later, he came up with various methods, such as copying down the broadcast programs published in the newspaper every day and giving them to the work point recorders of each production team to read aloud during labor breaks. Soon, listening to the radio became a part of their lives, and they would even urge the radio operator to come before he had finished his dinner.
    One person would say, "Runlin, tell us about dense planting of corn tonight!" Another would say, "No, let's talk about running the cooperative thriftily." The supply and marketing cooperative director wanted him to listen to experiences in saving funds, while the young men wanted him to listen to the speech on the military service law. Even the old men, old women, girls, and daughters-in-law often came to him, some wanting to listen to Shanxi Opera, others wanting to listen to songs…
    At this time, Runlin's wife would always pout, clattering the rice bowl, and mutter in a low voice. If Old Man Tiankui was present, she would vent her anger on him alone: "Do a good deed and let Runlin eat a full meal in peace!"
    At this time, Runlin would always laugh and interrupt, saying, "I'm full, I've been full for a long time."
    Now, something is troubling Zhang Runlin. Whenever he finishes listening according to the prescribed time, Old Man Tiankui or someone else presses down on the radio and demands, "Tell us another section on agricultural technology!" "Sing us a song!" Runlin always blushes and has to explain like a schoolchild reciting a text, "The battery only lasts for four months. If it's on for too long, we won't even be able to hear the experience introductions on increased production and the news later!"
    Only when he finally makes up his mind, slaps the radio off, and announces in a low voice, "Listening is over for today," do people slowly stand up, some arguing about what they just heard, and gradually disperse with great difficulty. He looks at their backs as they leave, feeling very sad.
    There is another thing that gives Zhang Runlin the biggest headache. The sound of a dry-cell battery radio is not loud. Every time they listen, even if everyone doesn't talk, cough, or tap off cigarette ash, those a little farther away from the radio still can't hear clearly. Moreover, every time the radio is turned on, it makes a rattling sound for a long time, and the announcer sounds like they have a cold, with a hoarse or buzzing voice. While adjusting the radio, Zhang Runlin keeps swallowing, wishing he could help the announcer soothe their throat. In fact, even after the adjustment is made and the volume is turned up to the maximum, the audience still crowds in front of the machine. Old Man Tiankui's ears are not very good. Every time they listen, he monopolizes the radio, tilting his head and aiming his left ear, which he finds more useful, at the speaker, causing everyone in the room to have opinions, and sometimes there are bound to be one or two arguments:
    "One person monopolizes the radio, don't others get to listen?"
    "I can't hear clearly, who can I blame?"
    Sometimes, Old Man Tiankui can't help but shake his head and sigh to Runlin, "When will we have a machine with a louder sound? We people are blind, can't read the newspaper, and have to rely on it..."
    That day, the cooperative held a grand meeting to celebrate the first harvest. The whole village was like celebrating a happy event, dressed in red and green, beating gongs and drums, men, women, old and young, gathered in a large open space. Zhang Runlin thought, "Such a major event that happens once a year, the radio work must also cooperate. I just changed a set of batteries, maybe the sound will be louder." He spent a lot of effort tying the speaker to the wooden post next to the podium. Who knew that the field was large and noisy, and after turning it on, the sound could only barely travel more than ten feet. The people around burst into laughter. Old Man Tiankui waved his hand and shouted to everyone, "What are you laughing at? What are you laughing at? This isn't Runlin's fault."
    Zhang Runlin stopped him and said, "Let them laugh, let them laugh, everyone is a socialist, they are happy in their hearts, and they are not satisfied with this because they want to hear a loud voice."
    Not long ago, the county held a radio operator meeting, deciding to establish a wired broadcasting network in all rural areas of the county. He had seen this thing in the army, and the sound was really loud. If you installed ten or eight speakers, the whole village could hear it. That night, he was so excited that he couldn't sleep.
    After returning to the village, he immediately put up the utility poles. Soon, the county sent people to deliver the wires and speakers, and said: whenever it is installed, you can start broadcasting.
    He quickly told this news to Old Man Tiankui. As soon as the old man heard it, he grabbed him and asked, "When will it be installed?"
    "Does that even need asking? Tomorrow, of course."
    Unexpectedly, a strong wind blew early the next morning, a terrifying tiger wind, roaring like thunder. A thick layer of ice had already formed on the glass windows. Looking out from the ice crevice, the sky seemed to have collapsed.
    Zhang Runlin put down his rice bowl, tightened his belt, and inserted pliers and a screwdriver into his belt. Runlin's wife grabbed him and said, "Spare me, are you really not going to risk your life? It's so cold, won't you freeze stiff and fall to the ground!"
    Runlin smiled and held her hand to his chest, saying, "Touch it, it's warm, what's there to be afraid of? This matter can't be delayed!"
    At this time, Old Man Tiankui suddenly pushed the door open and came in, his beard covered in ice, and it took him a long time to move his mouth before he shouted:
    "Runlin, let's go, I'll help you!"
    "Let's go!" Runlin jumped up happily, carried the wire, opened the door, and walked towards the street against the wind and cold.

    农村收音员
    丁芒
    张润林从部队复员回来，就当了乡里的收音员。他每天晚上把收音机背到各居民区去。开始时，总得三请四邀，才能集合十几个听众；后来，他想出了种种办法，每天把报纸上登载的广播节目抄下来，交给各生产队记工员，让他们在劳动休息的时候念一念。不久，听收音机就成了他们生活中的一部分，他们甚至等不得收音员吃完晚饭就来催了。
    这个说：“润林，今晚给讲讲玉米密植吧！”那个说：“不，还是讲勤俭办社好。”供销社主任要他收听节约资金的经验，小伙子们却要他收听兵役法讲话。连老汉、老婆子、姑娘媳妇也都常来找他，有的要听山西梆子，有的要听唱歌……
    这时候，润林嫂总是噘起嘴，饭碗碰得叮当响，低声嘟囔。假如天奎老汉在场，她就向他一个人发作一下：“你做做好事，让润林安安神神吃一顿饱饭吧！”
    这时候，润林总是笑着抢嘴说：“吃饱了，早就吃饱了。”
    现在，有件事却使张润林发愁。每当按照规定时间收听完毕，而天奎老汉或者旁人用手按住收音机，要求说：“再给讲一段农业技术吧！”“给我们唱个歌吧！”润林总是红着脸，不得不像小学生背书一样解释说：“电池要四个月才换一次，时间开久了，以后连增产经验介绍和新闻都听不上了！”
    一直等到他下定决心，拍一声关了收音机，低声宣布：“今天收听完了。”人们才慢腾腾地站起来，有的争论着刚才收听的事情，好不容易才逐渐散去。他望着人们的背影，心里很难过。
    还有件事情，最使张润林头疼。用干电池的收音机声音不大，每次收听，就算大家都不讲话、不咳嗽、不磕烟灰，离机子稍远些的还是没法听清楚。而且，每次打开收音机，都要沙拉沙拉响半天，广播员也像伤了风，声音不是发嗄就是发嗡。张润林一边调整，一边紧咽唾沫，恨不能帮广播员润润嗓子。其实调整好了，音量放到最大，听众还是直朝机子跟前挤。天奎老汉的耳朵不大灵，每次收听，总是他霸住机子，侧着头，用他自己觉得比较好使的左耳对准喇叭，惹得满屋子的人都有了意见，有时难免争吵一两句：
    “一个人霸住机子，别人不听啦？”
    “听不清呀，这能怪谁？”
    有时，天奎老汉也不得不对润林摇头叹气说：“什么时候，能有个声音大些的机子就好啦。俺们这些人，两眼漆黑，报纸看不下，就指靠它哩……”
    那天，合作社开大会庆祝第一次丰收。全村人像办喜事一样，穿红着绿，敲锣打鼓，男女老少，聚在一个大空场上。张润林寻思：“这么件一年一次的大事，收音工作也得配合配合；刚换来一套电池，声音也许响些。”他费好大劲把喇叭绑到主席台旁的木柱上。谁知场子大，又嘈杂，打开一听，声音只勉强能传一丈多远。四周的人轰地一声笑起来。天奎老汉摆着手对大家喊：“笑什么？笑什么？这又不是润林的过。”
    张润林挡住他说：“让他们笑吧，让他们笑吧，大家是社会主义的人啦，心里快活，要听大嗓门儿的，当然不满意这个。”
    不久以前，县里召开了收音员会议，决定要在全县农村里建立有线广播网。这东西他在部队里见过，声音真响亮，装上十个八个喇叭，全村都能听。那天晚上，他兴奋得怎么也睡不着。
    他回乡以后，马上把电线杆子树起来。不久，县里就派人送来了电线和喇叭，并且说：什么时候装好，什么时候就能开始收音。
    他赶忙把这消息告诉了天奎老汉。老汉一听，一把抓住他问道：“几时装？”
    “那还用问，明天嘛。”
    想不到，第二天一早就刮起大风，吓人的老虎风，嗡隆隆地像打雷。玻璃窗上早结了一层厚冰，从冰缝望出去，天像塌了下来。
    张润林丢下饭碗，紧了紧腰带，又把钳子和改锥插在腰带上。润林嫂一把拖住他说：“你饶了我吧，当真不要命啦？这么大冷天，看不把你冻硬了摔下地来！”
    润林笑着把她的手捧在胸前说：“你摸摸看，热烘烘的，怕什么？这件事耽误不得！”
    这时候，天奎老汉突然推门进来了，胡子上结着冰，嘴巴费劲地动了好久，才喊出来：
    “润林，走吧，我帮你的忙！”
    “走吧！”润林高兴得跳起来，背起电线，打开门，迎着风暴和严寒，向街上走去。
