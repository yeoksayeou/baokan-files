    Visit Factories and Rural Areas
    In order to properly solve the problems of graduation, further education, self-study, employment of middle and primary school graduates, and school enrollment for school-age children, the city of Mudanjiang, Heilongjiang Province, has specifically organized a working committee to lead this work. The mayor of the city serves as the director of the working committee.
    This year, many middle and primary school graduates in Mudanjiang cannot continue their education. This situation has caused fluctuations in the thinking of many parents and students. Some demand that the state increase the number of schools; some parents put pressure on their children, and graduating students are also very nervous. In response to this situation, various schools have adopted a variety of methods for education, such as organizing students to visit and interview factories and rural areas; inviting veteran cadres of the Long March to tell revolutionary stories; holding reports and seminars on the heroic deeds of martyrs such as General Yang Jingyu, Liu Hulan, and Zhao Yiman; teachers and students talking to each other and conducting family visits; and holding parent seminars. After these efforts, the ideological understanding of students, parents and students has been improved.

    Go Deep into Villages and Towns to Hold Seminars
    The Second Junior Middle School in Luoning County, Henan Province, took advantage of holidays to conduct parent visits in rural areas, and held parent seminars in different areas, explaining the reason why secondary education is to cultivate a new generation with culture and that this year’s middle and primary school graduates cannot all continue their education, hoping that parents will cherish students who participate in agricultural labor. According to many parents after the meeting: Since the teachers care so much about the children, why don’t we let them work in production with peace of mind?
    The Second Junior Middle School in Luoning County has taken a very good approach by going deep into the countryside and holding parent seminars. This can eliminate the concerns of some graduating students about participating in agricultural production.
  “The Road of Life is Broad”
    Recently, many middle school graduates in Chengdu have held various seminars with topics such as "The Road of Life is Broad." The students talked about the ultimate purpose of studying, which is to participate in production, and expressed that when they cannot continue their education, they will participate in various productive labor. Students in the graduating class of the First Middle School recently collectively wrote a letter to the agricultural production cooperatives in the suburbs, willing to be ordinary members and build a new socialist countryside. Wang Zhengzhong, a graduating student of the Second Middle School, not only decided to respond to the call of the motherland himself, but also persuaded other students to return to the countryside happily when they failed to get into school.
    Parents have also begun to make various arrangements for their children, so that when their children cannot continue their education, they will participate in production or study at home on their own.

    深入宣传学生参加生产的道理
    参观工厂农村
    黑龙江省牡丹江市，为了妥善解决中、小学毕业生升学、自学、就业和学龄儿童入学问题，专门组织了一个工作委员会，领导这一工作。该市市长担任工作委员会的主任。
    牡丹江市今年有许多中小学毕业生不能升学。这种情况，曾在许多家长和学生的思想上引起波动。有的要求国家增办学校；有些家长对子弟施加压力，应届毕业生也很紧张。针对这一情况，各学校采取了多种多样的方法进行教育，如组织学生到工厂、农村参观、访问；请长征干部讲革命故事；举办杨靖宇将军、刘胡兰、赵一曼等烈士英雄事迹报告会、座谈会；教员和学生谈心，进行家庭访问；召开家长座谈会等。经过这些工作，学生家长和学生的思想认识已有提高。

    深入村镇开座谈会
    河南省洛宁县第二初中利用假日深入农村进行家长访问，并分片召开家长座谈会，说明中学教育是为了培养有文化的新的一代和今年中小学毕业生不能全部升学的道理，希望家长们爱护参加农业劳动的学生。据会后许多家长反映：老师都这样关心孩子，咱为啥不让孩子安心生产。
    洛宁县第二初中这样深入农村，举行家长座谈会，是一个很好的办法。这样可以使一些应届毕业生消除参加农业生产的顾虑。
  “生活道路是广阔的”
    成都市许多中学应届毕业生最近以“生活道路是广阔的”等为题举行各种座谈会，学生们都谈到读书的最终目的，就是为了参加生产，表示不能升学时，要参加各种生产劳动。第一中学毕业班的学生最近还集体给郊区农业生产合作社写信，愿意去作一个普通社员，建设社会主义的新农村。第二中学应届毕业生王正忠不但自己决定响应祖国号召，他还劝导其他同学在考不取学校时也欢欢喜喜地回到农村去。
    学生家长也开始为子女作各种安排，当孩子不能升学的时候，就让他们参加生产，或者在家中自修。
