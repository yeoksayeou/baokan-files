    Soviet Council of Ministers Establishes Committee for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries
    (Dispatch from our Moscow correspondent) The Soviet Union has established a State Committee for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, which is directly under the Soviet Council of Ministers. Zhukov, the former deputy editor-in-chief of "Pravda," has been appointed chairman of the committee. The committee held a press conference on the afternoon of the 22nd. At the meeting, Zhukov said that the committee's task is to use all possible means to expand Soviet cultural exchanges with other countries. It mainly implements intergovernmental cultural agreements, while cultural ties between other social groups remain the responsibility of the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries. The Soviet Union is making every effort to develop cultural relations with foreign countries, but unfortunately, this desire has not been met with due sympathy from some countries. Zhukov said that the committee will assist foreign journalists in obtaining domestic news about the Soviet Union.

    苏联部长会议设立对外文化联系委员会
    本报莫斯科电　苏联成立了国家对外文化联系委员会，它直属苏联部长会议，“真理报”前副总编辑茹科夫被任命为委员会主席。22日下午这个委员会举行了记者招待会。茹科夫在会上说：这个委员会的任务是利用一切可能来扩大苏联同各国的文化交流。它主要执行政府间的文化协定，其他社会团体间的文化联系仍由苏联对外文化协会负责。苏联尽力发展对外文化联系，可惜这种愿望没有受到某些国家的应有同情。茹科夫说：委员会将协助外国记者取得有关苏联的国内新闻。
