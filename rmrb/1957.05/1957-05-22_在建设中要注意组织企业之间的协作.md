We must pay attention to organizing collaboration between enterprises in construction

As everyone knows, human production is, at any time and under any conditions, social production. People struggle with nature and utilize it to produce material goods, not individually, in isolation, but collectively, as a group, as a society. People cannot produce unless they unite in a proper manner, engage in joint activities, and mutually exchange their activities. This is a principle universally recognized by Marxists-Leninists. However, some people have forgotten this principle in our construction work. The most prominent manifestation of this is that many enterprises, when carrying out construction, demand "omnipotence" and "going it alone," and demand the construction of auxiliary workshops and laboratories that can be used jointly, and are unwilling to organize collaboration with relevant units.

For example, one industrial ministry under the central government is building eleven new factories in Xi'an. Almost all of them have large, modern woodworking shops, machine repair shops, and laboratories. Adding up the construction area of the woodworking shops in each factory, it amounts to 70,000 square meters, equivalent to the entire construction area of a large factory. The production tasks of these auxiliary workshops could have and should have been resolved by relying on the original local enterprises, or by building only one or two factories for collaborative use by the others. However, many factories located next to each other each built a complete set of woodworking and machine repair shops. These factories, although the sounds of machines are audible from one to another, do not interact with each other. As a result of the duplicate construction of auxiliary workshops, not only is the production capacity of the original similar factories not fully utilized, but the newly built auxiliary workshops also suffer from the problem of being "underfed." In Chengdu, the handmade woodworking industry has more than 890 people. Due to surplus production capacity, about half of them are currently idled, while most of the new factories built by some central industrial departments in Chengdu have also built woodworking shops. Currently, there is a surplus of machining capacity in the Chongqing and Chengdu areas, and there will be a surplus in the future. However, departments such as coal, petroleum, metallurgy, geology, and forestry in these areas are still constantly building new machinery repair factories with investments of several million yuan each. The situation is the same in the construction of laboratories. Some production units do not utilize the existing laboratories and technical personnel of local relevant production departments, scientific research institutions, and universities, but instead set up their own separate systems. This situation is very common. Moreover, this situation also exists in scientific research institutions, schools, and other institutions.

This practice wastes the state's construction funds and prevents the production capacity and various equipment of the original or newly built units from being fully utilized. At the same time, it creates situations of work stoppages and idling. This is a huge waste in the construction industry and is incompatible with the Party's policy of building the country diligently and thriftily, and must be corrected.

The emergence of this phenomenon of seeking comprehensiveness, going it alone, and not cooperating with each other in our construction industry is, of course, due to our lack of experience in construction work, primarily due to the lack of unified and comprehensive planning. However, on the other hand, the leaders of certain units, coveting the convenience of their own departments and units, clinging to the view of "not asking anyone for anything," blindly pursuing so-called "omnipotence," and adopting an intolerably indifferent attitude towards the use of state construction funds, have also allowed this phenomenon to develop to a serious extent. Some units, when determining new construction projects, neither investigate the existing production capacity available for utilization in the local area, nor study the collaboration issues of relevant newly built enterprises, but unilaterally pursue so-called "omnipotence." They do not understand that human production is social production, and that people cannot produce unless they engage in joint activities and mutually exchange their activities. As production develops, the social division of labor will become increasingly refined, and people will mutually exchange their activities more and more frequently in the production process, that is, the degree of collaboration between production units and enterprises will become higher and higher. Therefore, in reality, a truly "omnipotent factory" is impossible to exist; the idea of "going it alone" violates the laws of production development. As for wasting state construction funds for the sake of convenience for one's own department or unit, that is even more wrong. Because our country's construction funds do not come easily, and the people demand that we use one yuan as if it were several yuan, and that we adopt the most serious and responsible attitude in handling it. What kind of ideological style is it for those who waste state funds for the convenience of their own units, and even feel complacent about being able to spend money? This is the ideology of "lazybones" and the work style of "young masters." This ideological style has already been sharply criticized in the Party Central Committee's instructions on the rectification movement. It is obvious that this erroneous ideological style is a great enemy of socialist industrialization and must be criticized.

In the past, improper spending was mainly due to lack of experience, which is excusable to some extent. However, after spending some money unjustly and paying a certain price, we should learn from it. However, a few of our comrades believe that since they have not put the money in their own pockets and have not embezzled it, they have a clear conscience. This is a completely unacceptable statement. Not embezzling is, of course, what should be done, and it can be said to be good compared to the Kuomintang; but is it correct to waste money without embezzling? Does it mean that under the people's democratic regime, the only requirement for selecting staff is that they do not embezzle? Is this the only condition? Obviously, this view is incorrect. We need talents who cherish state property and build the country diligently and thriftily, not "young masters." Those who say these things may be carrying an old-timer label. For them, the people's requirement is: to maintain the selfless and non-embezzling style of the old cadres, to inherit the revolutionary tradition of hard work, and to learn the skills of building the country diligently and thriftily.

In order to improve collaboration among enterprises, in addition to strengthening political and ideological education and criticizing the above-mentioned erroneous views, specific organizational work should also be carried out. First, it should be stipulated that, according to the current economic and technical conditions of our country, and according to the laws of production collaboration, if the productivity of the existing machine repair factories and woodworking factories in the same area can be utilized (which is the case in many areas), then the newly built enterprises should no longer build machine repair shops and woodworking shops; those that have already been built should be converted to other uses. The equipment in all these workshops should be transferred to units that need it more urgently. The same should be done in the construction of laboratories. If there are similar experimental institutions and experimental personnel in local or nearby production units, scientific research institutions, and universities that can be utilized, the newly built units should no longer build such laboratories. All the machine repair, woodworking, and experimental tasks of the newly built units should be undertaken by the original production units or scientific research units in the local or nearby areas. All units that are requested to collaborate should adopt a proactive and positive attitude, and should not adopt an attitude of shirking responsibility. These units should understand that under the socialist system, each production unit and institution is an organic part of the socialist society, and only through mutual support and mutual collaboration can we do a good job in socialist construction. Any attitude that regards one's own enterprise or institution as an "independent little world" and refuses to cooperate with units that request it is harmful to the development of socialist construction.

In organizing the collaboration of various enterprises and units, the leading organizations of local party committees and governments bear a major responsibility. Because this kind of collaboration can only be reasonably arranged on a regional basis, especially on a city basis. In the future, local party and government leading organs should conduct careful investigation and research on the local machine repair capacity, woodworking processing capacity, forging and casting capacity, and the capacity of various experimental institutions, and specifically organize the collaboration of relevant units. Before carrying out construction, all newly built enterprises, for those parts that require collaboration from relevant units, should submit a request to the local government, especially when building auxiliary workshops such as machine repair and woodworking, they should obtain the permission of the local government. Only in this way can we effectively overcome the phenomenon of each enterprise building its own system and not cooperating with each other in enterprise construction.

### 在建设中要注意组织企业之间的协作

    在建设中要注意组织企业之间的协作
    大家知道，人类的生产在任何时候和任何条件之下都是社会的生产。人们同自然界作斗争，并且利用自然界来生产物质资料，不是彼此孤立，彼此隔绝地单独进行的，而是以团体为单位，以社会为单位来共同进行的。人们如果不用相当的方式结合起来，共同活动和相互交换他们的活动，便不能生产。这是马克思列宁主义者公认的原理。但是，这个原理，在我们建设工作中，却被一些人遗忘了。在这方面最突出的表现，就是许多企业在进行建设的时候都要求“全能”、“单干”，都要求建设可以共同使用的辅助车间和实验室，而不肯同有关单位组织协作。
    例如，中央有一个工业部在西安新建的十一个工厂，几乎都有很大的近代化的木工车间和机修车间以及实验室。把各个工厂的木工车间的建筑面积加在一起就有七万平方公尺，等于一个大型工厂的全部建筑面积。而这些辅助车间的生产任务，本来应该而且完全可能依靠地方原有的企业来解决，或者只要一个或两个工厂建设，其它工厂协作共用，就完全可以了。但是，许多紧邻的工厂却各自建设了一套完整的木工车间和机修车间。这些工厂虽然机器之声相闻，而彼此却老死不相往来。由于重复建设辅助车间的结果，不仅原有的同类工厂的生产能力不能充分利用，而且新建的这些辅助车间也闹“吃不饱”的问题。成都市的手工木器行有八百九十余人，因生产能力有余，目前约有一半人窝工，而中央的一些工业部门在成都新建的工厂中，大多数还建设了木工车间。目前在重庆和成都地区的机械加工能力已经有剩余，将来也有剩余，但是，在这些地区的煤炭、石油、冶金、地质、森林工业等部门，还各以几百万元的投资不断地建设新的机械修配工厂。在实验室的建设方面，也是这样。有些生产单位，不利用当地有关的生产部门和科学研究机构以及大专学校现有的实验室和技术人员，而另搞一套。这种情形也是很普遍的。而且这种情形在科学研究机关、学校及其它事业部门也是存在的。
    这种做法，既浪费了国家的建设资金，又使原有的或者新建单位的生产能力和各种设备不能充分利用。同时造成了停工、窝工的情况，这是建设事业中的一项巨大的浪费，是同党的勤俭建国方针不相容的，必须加以纠正。
    在我们建设事业中产生了这种求全、单干、互不协作的现象，当然是因为我们对于建设工作的经验不够，首先是由于没有统一的全面规划所致。但是，另一方面，某些单位的领导人员贪图本部门、本单位的方便，抱着“万事不求人”的观点，盲目追求所谓“全能化”，而对国家建设资金的使用，采取了不可容忍的漠不关心的态度，也使这种现象发展到严重的程度。有些单位，在确定新的建设项目的时候，既不调查当地已有的可资利用的生产能力，也不研究有关新建企业的协作问题，而片面地追求所谓“全能化”。他们不了解，人类的生产是社会的生产，人们如果不共同活动和相互交换他们的活动，便不能生产。而随着生产的发展，社会分工将愈来愈细，人们在生产过程中相互交换他们的活动将愈来愈频繁，也就是说，在各生产单位、各企业之间的协作程度将愈来愈高。因此，实际上，真正的“全能工厂”是不可能存在的；“单干”的思想，是违背生产发展的规律的。至于为图本部门、本单位的方便，不惜浪费国家的建设资金，那更是错误的。因为我国的建设资金来得不易，人民要求我们把一元钱当几元钱用，要求我们采取最严肃最负责的态度来处理它。那些为了本单位的方便而浪费国家资金，甚至以为自己能花钱而洋洋得意，这是一种什么思想作风呢？这是“懒汉”思想和“大少爷”作风。这种思想作风是党中央关于整风运动指示中已经尖锐地批判了的。很明显，这种错误的思想作风是社会主义工业化的大敌，必须加以批判。
    过去花钱不当，主要是由于没有经验，这在某种程度上是可以原谅的。但是，花了一些冤枉钱，付了一定的代价之后，就应该从中取得经验教训。而我们有少数同志却以为，反正自己没有把钱装在荷包里，没有贪污过，因而无愧于心。这是完全不能容忍的说法。不贪污这当然是应该的，与国民党比较起来也可以说是好的；但是，不贪污而浪费难道是正确的吗？难道说在人民民主政权下选择工作人员，只要不贪污就行了吗？这是唯一的条件么？显然，这种看法是不对的。我们需要爱护国家资财和勤俭建国的人材，而不需要“大少爷”。说这些话的人显然可能背了一个老资格的招牌。对于他们，人民的要求是：既要保持老干部大公无私的不贪污的作风，还要继承艰苦奋斗的革命传统，学会勤俭建国的本领。
    为了搞好各企业之间的协作，除了要加强政治思想教育，批判上面所说的那些错误观点之外，还应当进行具体的组织工作。首先应该规定，根据目前我国的经济条件和技术条件，根据生产协作的规律，在同一地区内，如果原有的机械修理工厂、木作工厂的生产力可资利用的话（目前许多地区是具备这种条件的），那末，新建的企业就一律不再建设机修车间和木工车间；已经建设的应该改作别的用途。所有这些车间的设备，应该调给更急需的单位使用。在实验室的建设方面，也应该这样。凡在当地或者附近地区的生产单位、科学研究机构和大专学校有同类的试验机构和试验人员可以利用的，新建设单位就不要再建设这种实验室，所有新建单位的机修、木工和试验的任务，就由当地或者附近地区内原有的生产单位或科学研究单位承当。凡是被请求协作的单位，应该采取主动的积极的态度，而不能抱推诿塞责的态度。这些单位应当了解，在社会主义制度下，每个生产单位和事业单位都是社会主义社会有机的组成部分之一，只有相互支援，相互协作，才能搞好社会主义建设。任何把自己的企业和事业单位看做“独立的小天地”，而对要求协作的单位拒之于门外的态度，都是对社会主义建设事业的发展有害的。
    在组织各企业单位的协作中，地方党委和政府的领导机构负有重大的责任。因为这种协作只能以地区特别是以城市为单位进行合理安排。今后，地方党政领导机关应对本地的机械修理能力，木工加工能力，锻铸能力和各种试验机构的能力进行仔细的调查研究，并且具体组织有关单位的协作。各新建企业在进行建设之前，凡需要有关单位协作的部分，应向当地政府提出，特别是在建设机修、木工等辅助车间的时候，应该得到当地政府的许可。只有这样，才能有效地克服企业建设中各搞一套、互不协作的现象。
