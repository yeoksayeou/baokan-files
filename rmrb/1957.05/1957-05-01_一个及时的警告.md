    A Timely Warning
    The Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement on April 29 regarding the situation in Jordan, declaring the Soviet Union's concern for the Jordanian situation. The statement pointed out that the events in Jordan are the result of imperialist crude interference in Arab countries, and a new conspiracy by imperialism to create tension in the Middle East and attempt to enslave the Arab people by undermining the unity of Arab countries. The Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs pointed out that the escalation of the Middle East situation caused by the events in Jordan is fraught with serious dangers. And the Western countries, primarily the United States, must be responsible for such possible consequences.
    This statement by the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs once again demonstrates the Soviet government and people's great concern for maintaining peace in the Middle East and the independence of Arab countries. It is a timely warning to the imperialists who attempt to enslave the Arab people.
    After the failure of the three countries, Britain, France, and Israel, to invade Egypt, the imperialists have been trying to salvage their crumbling colonial rule in the Middle East. In particular, the United States, the most ferocious colonialist, attempts to take this opportunity to replace Britain and France and become the colonial ruler of the Middle East. The "Eisenhower Doctrine" is a challenge from the United States to the peace-loving, independence-seeking Arab people.
    In order to safeguard the independence of Arab countries and consolidate peace in the Middle East, the Soviet government once proposed that the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France should declare that foreign interference in the internal affairs of Middle Eastern countries is not allowed, and later proposed that the four countries should condemn the use of force in the Middle East region. However, these proposals were not accepted by Western countries. This exposes the premeditated aggressive conspiracy of the Western countries, led by the United States, against Arab countries.
    However, American imperialism faces a major obstacle, which is the unity of the free Arab countries. This unity has developed in the struggle of Arab countries against colonialism, and it has been further consolidated and strengthened in the process of Egypt's resistance to aggression. If this unity is not undermined, the United States will not be able to pull more Arab countries into the Baghdad Pact or other aggressive blocs, and will not be able to further expand the United States' aggressive forces.
    The Jordan incident was an attack by the United States to undermine the unity of Arab countries. The United States used the internal situation in Jordan, exerted influence from all sides, and carried out open interference, even at the expense of dispatching its Sixth Fleet. This crude and blatant interference by the United States has once again posed a serious threat to the Middle East peace that has just been restored after the Egyptian incident. It is clear that the United States' interference in the Jordanian situation is to set a precedent for its further interference in the internal affairs of other Arab countries. The fact that part of the United States Sixth Fleet sailed to the vicinity of Turkey and part of it sailed to Lebanon, forming a threat to Syria, is a trend worthy of close attention.
    The statement of the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs reiterated the Soviet Union's principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of Arab countries, which is in sharp contrast to the current behavior of the United States and other Western countries. The statement of the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs emphasized the importance of the unity of the Arab peoples, which is the key to the Arab peoples' maintenance of independence. The Soviet government's sincere concern and legitimate indignation once again prove that the Soviet Union is a true friend of the freedom-loving Arab people.
    The statement of the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs is a strong support from the Soviet government and people for the Arab peoples' just struggle against imperialism. The Chinese people fully support this position of the Soviet government. The Chinese people, like the Soviet people, resolutely oppose imperialist aggression and interference against the Arab peoples. We firmly believe that the Arab people will protect their unity, freedom, and independence like the apple of their eye. With the support of peace-loving people all over the world, the Arab people's just struggle against imperialism will surely be victorious.

### 一个及时的警告

    一个及时的警告
    苏联外交部在4月29日就约旦问题发表声明，宣布苏联对于约旦局势的关心。声明指出，约旦事件是帝国主义对阿拉伯国家进行粗暴干涉的结果，是帝国主义在中东制造紧张局势、企图通过破坏阿拉伯国家团结来奴役阿拉伯人民的新阴谋所造成的。苏联外交部指出，由于约旦事件而引起的中东局势的尖锐化，充满着严重的危险。而西方国家，首先是美国，要对这种可能的后果负责。
    苏联外交部的这个声明，再一次表现了苏联政府和人民对于维护中东和平和阿拉伯国家的独立的巨大关怀。它是对于企图奴役阿拉伯人民的帝国主义者的一个及时警告。
    在英、法、以三国侵略埃及失败以后，帝国主义者无时无刻不在想法挽救它们在中东的摇摇欲坠的殖民统治。特别是美国这个最凶恶的殖民主义者，它企图乘此机会代替英、法的地位，成为中东的殖民统治者。“艾森豪威尔主义”就是美国向爱好和平、争取独立的阿拉伯人民的挑战。
    为了维护阿拉伯国家的独立，巩固中东的和平，苏联政府曾经建议由苏、美、英、法四国宣布不许外国干涉中东各国的内政，后来又建议由四国宣布谴责在中东地区使用武力。但是这些建议都没有为西方国家所接受。这就暴露了以美国为首的西方国家对阿拉伯各国处心积虑的侵略阴谋。
    但是美帝国主义面对着一个最大的阻碍，这就是自由的阿拉伯各国的团结。这个团结是阿拉伯各国在反对殖民主义的斗争中发展起来的，它在埃及抵抗侵略的过程中得到了进一步的巩固和加强。如果不破坏这个团结，美国就无法把更多的阿拉伯国家拉进巴格达条约或其他侵略性的集团，就无法进一步扩张美国的侵略势力。
    约旦事件就是美国破坏阿拉伯国家团结的一次进攻。美国利用约旦内部的局势，从各方面施加影响，进行公开的干涉，甚至不惜出动它的第六舰队。美国这种粗暴的露骨的干涉，对埃及事件以后刚刚恢复的中东和平，又一次造成了严重的威胁。很明显，美国干涉约旦局势，是要为它进一步干涉其他阿拉伯国家的内政开创先例。美国第六舰队的一部分舰只开往土耳其附近，一部分舰只开到黎巴嫩，形成了对叙利亚的威胁，这是一个值得密切注意的动向。
    苏联外交部的声明重申了苏联不干涉阿拉伯国家内政的原则，这同美国和其他西方国家现在的行为形成了鲜明的对照。苏联外交部在声明中强调指出了阿拉伯各国人民团结的重要性，这种团结是阿拉伯各国人民维护独立的关键。苏联政府这种真诚的关怀和正当的义愤，又一次证明了苏联是爱好自由的阿拉伯人民的真正朋友。
    苏联外交部的声明，是苏联政府和人民对于阿拉伯各国人民反对帝国主义的正义斗争的有力支持。中国人民完全支持苏联政府的这种立场。中国人民也和苏联人民一样，坚决反对帝国主义对阿拉伯各国人民的侵略和干涉。我们坚信：阿拉伯人民将像保护眼珠一样地保护他们的团结、自由和独立。在全世界爱好和平的人民的支持之下，阿拉伯人民反对帝国主义的正义斗争必将取得胜利。
