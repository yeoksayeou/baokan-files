    The Ku Klux Klan in the United States is Becoming Increasingly Rampant
    (By our reporter) In recent years, the old American terrorist organization, the Ku Klux Klan, whose purpose is to promote racial discrimination, persecute blacks, and prevent domestic progressive movements, has become increasingly rampant in the southern states of the United States. An article in the American magazine "Outlook" at the end of April exposed some of the activities of this terrorist group.
    "Outlook" magazine said that since the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on May 17, 1954, banning racial segregation in U.S. public schools, the number of Ku Klux Klan members has increased by 100,000 in the past three years. In 1956 alone, 50,000 people joined this terrorist organization. The Ku Klux Klan has 500 local organizations, each with approximately 25 to 1,000 people.
    In 1956, Ku Klux Klan members terrorized blacks and whites who opposed racial discrimination in the states of Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, and Tennessee, burning crosses in front of their homes more than a thousand times. In the fall of 1956, a group of Ku Klux Klan members in Florida even broke into a prison, kidnapped a black man, and flogged him.
    In January of this year, the Ku Klux Klan's terrorist activities in Alabama reached a climax. On the night of January 10, six explosions occurred in Montgomery, Alabama. Four black churches were destroyed, and two pastors' residences were reduced to ashes. (Attached picture)

    美国三K党日益猖獗
    本报讯　近几年以来，以提倡种族歧视、迫害黑人、阻止国内进步运动为宗旨的美国老牌恐怖组织三K党在美国南部各州的活动日益猖獗。4月底的一期美国“展望”杂志有一篇文章暴露了这个恐怖团体的一些活动。
      “展望”杂志说，自从1954年5月17日美国最高法院裁决禁止美国公立学校实行种族隔离以后，三年来三K党党员的人数增加了十万名。仅在1956年一年就有五万人参加了这个恐怖组织。三K党拥有五百个地方组织，每个组织的人数约为二十五人至一千人不等。
    1956年，三K党人曾在卡罗来纳、佐治亚、佛罗里达、亚拉巴马、密士失必、路易斯安那、得克萨斯、田纳西各州对黑人以及反对种族歧视的白人进行恐吓，在他们的住宅前燃烧十字架共达千余次之多。1956年秋天，佛罗里达州的一群三K党人竟冲入监狱，把一名黑人劫出，加以鞭打。
    今年1月，亚拉巴马州三K党人的恐怖活动达于高潮。1月10日晚上，亚拉巴马州蒙哥马利市发生爆炸案六起，四所黑人教堂被炸毁，两座牧师住宅化为灰烬。（附图片）
