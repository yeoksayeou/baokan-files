Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 9th -- According to a report in the Soviet "Pravda" on the 8th, the Soviet workers building the "Friendship Railway" have decided in a labor competition to complete the track-laying tasks for both this year and next year by the end of this year. This year's task will be completed before July 1st. By the end of next year, the entire 312-kilometer railway track from the Soviet Aktogay station to the Chinese Xinjiang border will be fully laid and open to traffic. Soviet workers are enthusiastically looking forward to joining forces with Chinese railway construction workers soon.

These railway construction workers are launching this labor competition to welcome the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution. Currently, the railway line is extending eastward, and the construction site has advanced into the sparsely populated and most difficult desert area. Residential areas have already been built. The next phase of construction will take place in the Dzungarian Gate valley area.

    苏联工人一年干两年的活
    “友谊铁路”明年修至新疆
    新华社莫斯科9日电　据苏联“真理报”8日报道，苏联修筑“友谊铁路”的工人们在劳动竞赛中决定，在今年年底前完成今、明两年的铺轨任务。今年的任务将在7月1日前完成。到明年年底，从苏联阿克斗卡站到中国新疆边境的全长三百一十二公里的铁轨将可以全部铺好，并且通车。苏联工人们热情地希望早日和中国筑路工人会师。
    这些筑路工人是为了迎接十月革命四十周年而展开这种劳动竞赛的。目前铁路线正在向东延伸，工地已经推进到人烟稀少、最难施工的荒漠地带。居住区已经建成了。下一步的施工将在戎加尔狭谷地带进行。
