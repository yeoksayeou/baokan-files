In Brotherly Lands

    The First Electronic Computer
    Hungary will manufacture and put into operation its first electronic computer within a year.
    This was stated by Varga Sándor, director of the Electronic Computer Research Institute of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, to newspaper reporters on May 2. He said that the future electronic computer will be equipped with 800 vacuum tubes and will be able to perform 1,500 operations per second. Varga also said that the Soviet Union will provide strong assistance in the manufacture of this electronic computer.

    Rapid Steel Rolling Equipment Put Into Production
    The first fully mechanized rapid steel rolling equipment in the German Democratic Republic has been put into production on May 2. This most modern rapid steel rolling production line was built at the "Wilhelm Florin Steel Rolling Mill" in Henningsdorf, a suburb of Berlin. It will produce 100,000 tons of rolled steel products annually, mainly various steel materials such as giant pliers and screws required for the construction and machinery industries.

    Southeast Europe's Largest Synthetic Fiber Factory
    Romania is building the first synthetic fiber factory in the country, which is also the largest in Southeast Europe. This new factory, equipped with the most modern equipment, will be put into production by the end of next year.
    Romania's chemical industry has undergone tremendous development in the era of the people's democratic regime. Its output is currently seven times higher than in 1938 and more than twice as high as in 1950.
    The products of Romania's chemical industry not only meet domestic needs but are also exported to Austria, Switzerland, Finland, West Germany, Italy, India, Israel, Yugoslavia, and China. (Attached picture)

    在兄弟之邦
    第一架电子计算机
    匈牙利将在一年之内制造出第一架电子计算机，并且开始工作。
    这是匈牙利科学院电子计算机研究所所长瓦尔加·山多尔5月2日向报纸记者发表谈话时讲到的。他说，这架未来的电子计算机将安装八百支电子管，每秒钟可运算一千五百次。瓦尔加还说，苏联将在制造这架电子计算机方面给予大力的帮助。
    快速轧钢设备投入生产
    民主德国第一套完全机械化的快速轧钢设备已经在5月2日投入生产。这套最现代化的快速轧钢作业线是在柏林郊区赫宁斯多夫的“威廉·弗洛林轧钢厂”建成的。它将每年生产十万吨轧钢制品，主要是生产为建筑业和机器制造业所需的巨钳、螺钉等多种钢材。
    东南欧最大的合成纤维工厂
    罗马尼亚正在建设全国第一个、也是东南欧最大的一个合成纤维工厂。这个将以最现代化的设备装备的新工厂将在明年年底投入生产。
    罗马尼亚的化学工业在人民民主政权时代有了巨大的发展。目前它的产量比1938年增加了七倍，比1950年增加了两倍多。
    罗马尼亚化学工业的产品不仅可以满足本国的需要，而且还向奥地利、瑞士、芬兰、西德、意大利、印度、以色列、南斯拉夫和中国出口。（附图片）
