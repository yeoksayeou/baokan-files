    "Reviewing Our Strength"
    The celebration of the "May Day" International Labor Day by the people of the capital will be filmed into a news documentary by the Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio. The tentative title of this film is "Reviewing Our Strength."
    In order to ensure that this news film could meet the audience in the capital and Tianjin on the evening of May 2nd, the comrades of the film studio were working hard. From the beginning of April, they repeatedly discussed the creative plan. In the days before "May Day," more than thirty photographers went to Tiananmen Square to choose shooting angles again and again. They were going to set up twenty-three photography points and two recording points there. One photography point was to be set up on the Jinshui Bridge, which would use a high-angle telephoto lens to capture the dynamics of the presidium on the Tiananmen Gate Tower from the front. A group of photographers on the Tiananmen Gate Tower would also capture various shots. According to past experience, when the parade reaches Tiananmen Square, the enthusiastic mood will reach its climax. Therefore, seven photographers will specialize in capturing "climax" shots here.
    The photographers also went to the preparatory institutions of the celebration meeting and various organizations that were about to participate in the parade to learn about the situation. They found out that in the parade, the honor guard would hold paper flowers and raise them to form the two Chinese characters for "May 1st"; when the "Young Pioneers" walked to Tiananmen, they would release many pigeons symbolizing peace from the lotus leaves and lotus flowers they held. A team of Young Pioneers would hold Beijing's unique toy - windmills; the workers' team and farmers' team would carry models expressing their new production achievements and construction achievements in striving to complete the first five-year plan ahead of schedule; the art team would have various flower baskets, floats, and dances symbolizing "a hundred flowers blooming"; the puppet troupe's puppet show - Pigsy carrying his bride, the flower drums of the sports team, the big umbrellas and small umbrellas of the acrobatic team, the primary and secondary school athletes riding unicycles, as well as the night view of Tiananmen, fireworks, and carnival dances; etc., have all been included in the plan for capturing basic shots.
    From the beginning of the "May Day" celebration meeting, their work plan was calculated by the hour: 13:00 to 14:00, the first batch of sound and picture films (about 120 meters) arrived at the factory; 15:00, the second batch of negatives (about 2,000 meters) arrived at the factory; 16:00, the third batch of negatives (about 220 meters) arrived at the factory; ... 24:00, the last batch of negatives arrived at the factory. 20:00, the first batch of sample films were developed and printed; 23:00, the third batch of sample films were developed and printed; 4:30 on May 2nd, the last batch of sample films were developed and printed. 6:00 on the morning of the 2nd, the sample films were edited and the commentary was written; 11:00 on the 2nd, the music and sound effects were matched; 18:00 on the 2nd, three sets of copies were developed and printed; 18:30, the review was completed. This film is expected to meet the audience in the capital at 19:00 on May 2nd; and meet the audience in Tianjin at 21:00 on May 2nd. On May 4th or 5th, more copies that have been developed and printed will be shown in cities such as Shanghai, Shenyang, and Wuhan. At the same time, the film studio will also develop and print a batch of materials to send to film studios in more than twenty countries.
    In addition to the Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio, the Beijing Film Studio will shoot some widescreen film footage and Soviet filmmakers will shoot some color footage of the "May Day" celebrations at Tiananmen Square.

    Broadcasting the Live Situation to the Whole Country
    "The loudspeakers on the street are quietly saving their voices,
    When the time comes, they will make a deafening sound."
    These are two lines from the poem "Welcoming 'May Day'" written by the poet Zang Kejia.
    The staff of the radio station and the members of the Beijing Electrical Installation Production Cooperative installed many large loudspeakers on the streets of Beijing as early as a few days before Voroshilov came to Beijing. One hundred and sixty were installed in Tiananmen Square and East and West Chang'an Avenue; plus two hundred and sixty large loudspeakers from Dongdan to Dongsi, from Wangfujing Street to Kuanjie.
    In the days before "May Day," the comrades of the radio station repeatedly tested the sound and measured it. As a result of the test, they guaranteed that no matter how the weather changes on "May Day," even if there is a strong wind and heavy rain, radio listeners all over Beijing and China can listen to the live situation in front of Tiananmen Square from the radio from 9:45 in the morning.
    The comrades of the radio station installed many microphones in front of the band in Tiananmen Square, at the artillery positions for setting off salutes, and on Tiananmen Square; in order to be able to hear the cheers and footsteps of the parade in front of Tiananmen Square, they also specially installed microphones on the top of the Huabiao pillars and on the roadside at the base of the Huabiao pillars. The announcers familiar to radio listeners - comrades Qi Yue and Pan Jie - will be waiting next to the microphone under the flagpole on the right side of Tiananmen Gate Tower. When the band plays the tune of "The East is Red" before ten o'clock, the announcers will announce: Chairman Mao and Chairman Voroshilov have walked onto the Tiananmen Gate Tower. Then, they will tell the audience the live situation of the parade in succession.

    Seventy Hundred Thousand Flowers
    When the people in the parade raise the bouquets in their hands and cheer to Chairman Mao, to the leading comrades, to Chairman Voroshilov, and to all the foreign friends, have you ever counted how many flowers there are? Do you know who cultivated them? Maybe you will answer me: as countless as the drops of water in the sea; they were cultivated by gardeners. Here, I want to tell you: there are a total of seven hundred thousand flowers; they were cultivated by the members of the Beijing Yiguang First Artificial Silk Flower Production Cooperative within half a month, and they are their gift to "May Day."

    When You Are Thirsty
    In Beijing in May, it is still a bit chilly in the morning, but by noon, the sun shines directly overhead, and sweat will soak your clothes again. People who have experience participating in the "May Day" parade always eat more and drink less for breakfast. At noon, the parade is in full swing, the weather is getting hot, you are not hungry, but your mouth is terribly thirsty. At this time when your tongue is parched and your lips are dry, how much you want to drink a cup of clean and cool water to make the songs sing even louder! How much you want to hold a handful of cool water to wipe the sweat-soaked face!
    Comrades! As long as you need water, you can use it with confidence! There are many tap water faucets on the side of the road you are marching past and on your way home. This is specially prepared for everyone by the Beijing Tap Water Company. The total length of all the water pipes is thirty miles. The water in the water pipes has been flushed, soaked, and tested by the health and epidemic prevention department before the faucets are installed for everyone to drink. Drinking such clean water will never upset your stomach.

    White Bear Popsicles on the Market
    Today, people participating in the parade can buy Arctic White Bear brand popsicles at the food stalls along the road again. These were specially made by the workers of the Beijing Food Factory for the holiday. They prepared a total of 300,000 popsicles, more than 400 kilograms of ice cream, and enough soda and beer.

    Butterflies Frolicking Among Stars
    Tonight, when you watch the fireworks in front of Tiananmen Square, if your child asks you, you can tell him this: this firework looks like a parachute at first, and then there is a cluster of white and glittering stamens, hanging high in the air like the moon, followed by countless colorful and dazzling small flowers below. This kind of firework is called "Moonlit Garden." Another firework, after exploding in the air, appears with thousands of flashes of light, scurrying around everywhere. This flower is called "Fire Dragon."
    You can also tell the child that there are a total of ten categories and three thousand two hundred and eighty fireworks tonight, including "Flowers of Peace Blooming," "Peacock Spreading its Tail," "Butterflies Frolicking Among Stars," and chrysanthemums of various colors. These were all carefully made by the workers in a factory a thousand miles away.

    Beautiful Night Park
    Comrades, are you planning to participate in the evening party in Tiananmen Square tonight? Then, accompany your lover, bring your children, or hold the hands of your classmates and friends, and sing, dance, and have fun to your heart's content! Zhang Qing, a labor model from the Beijing Electric Power Bureau, led more than forty electric light installation workers and installed more than six hundred 1,000-watt spotlights all the way from Beijing Hotel to Fuyou Street. The "outlined electric lights" installed on tall buildings such as Tiananmen, Beijing Hotel, the Ministry of Coal Industry, the Ministry of Textile Industry, the People's Bank of China, and the courts have also been strictly checked. Even if there is a strong wind and heavy rain, they will still shine brightly.
    When you walk into Zhongshan Park, you will find that the night of this year's "May Day" is more beautiful than the "May Day" in previous years. Electric light workers also put "outlined string lights" on the roof of the ancient Zhongshan Hall. The electric light installation workers and the workers of the light bulb factory also jointly made four peace doves with neon lights on the archways around the altar of the five-colored earth in Shejitan. After the power is turned on, it will automatically spread its wings and move, as if it is about to fly. The colorful electric lights on the wisteria frame and the lush ancient cypresses on both sides have been changed from the five-color lights of previous years to one color per tree, making people feel more elegant. The voltage of the colorful electric lights on the dragon claw locust inside the "Defend Peace" stone archway has been reduced, making the light softer.

    International Friends' Home
    These days, the squares in front of major hotels in Beijing are filled with shiny cars of all sizes. The buildings are dressed in colorful costumes, and many international friends of different nationalities, different skin colors, and different languages are constantly going in and out.
    All the staff of the Beijing Hotel started a competition on April 20. From the dormitory to the kitchen, from the furniture to the walls, everything was cleaned thoroughly. The guest service team worked day and night to shine shoes, iron clothes, buy newspapers, and get medicine for foreign guests. No matter how big or small the matter, they were always available.
    The Qianmen Hotel will receive more than 500 foreign guests from more than 40 countries this time. As early as before "May Day," they added a foreign language newspaper and magazine sales point, increased the number of personnel handling telegrams and remittances, and added more than 30 kinds of commodities such as mirrors, eyebrow pencils, and lipsticks to the commissary. The waiters in the Western restaurant are particularly nervous these days. Older waiters teach new waiters how to set the table cloth, put knives and forks, and learn foreign menu names; teach them how to fold napkins into fan surfaces, cabbage flowers, dragon eye fish, peace doves, and other patterns. Zhao Yongzhen, who just graduated from senior primary school last summer vacation, is wearing a blue dress and a bleached apron, skillfully walking around the restaurant. Who would have thought that this little girl who talks and laughs with foreign guests does not even know the foreign alphabet?

    A Thousand-Person Cleaning Team
    Today, more than one million people in the capital will take to the streets. At dawn, the main streets and alleys of Beijing are clean; one and a half hours after the parade has completely passed through Tiananmen, the main streets and alleys of Beijing will also be clean. Whose credit is this? It is the credit of the cleaning team composed of one thousand people in Beijing.
    From April 22 to 30, 284 sets of toilets of various forms appeared one after another on the main streets of the capital. Some are like mobile houses, and some are like tents. Among these many toilets, there are also seven car toilets. Inside, there are not only flush toilets, but also mirrors, simple washing and makeup items. The parts for assembling this car were all found from the waste pile. Through the efforts of the workers of the Beijing Automobile Assembly Factory, these waste materials have become beautiful and spacious car toilets.
    At the end of the parade, there is also a blitz cleaning team composed of 160 people. As soon as the parade is over, they will carry out blitz cleaning work. The goal they put forward is to complete all cleaning within one and a half hours after the end of the parade and start watering with sprinklers. At that time, when people walk from East and West Chang'an Avenue and from Wangfujing, who would see that one million people have just passed by? (By our reporter) (Attached picture)

    为了欢度五一
    “检阅我们的力量”
    首都人民庆祝“五一”国际劳动节的情形，将由中央新闻纪录电影制片厂摄制成新闻纪录影片。这部影片的名称预定为“检阅我们的力量”。
    为了争取在5月2日晚间就能使这部新闻影片跟首都和天津的观众见面，制片厂的同志们都紧张地投入了战斗。从4月初开始，他们就反复讨论了创作计划。“五一”前几天，三十多个摄影师一次又一次地到天安门一带选择摄影角度。他们将要在那里设置二十三个摄影点，两个录音点。有一个摄影点要设在金水桥，它将用高射式的长镜头从正面摄取天安门城楼上主席台上的动态。天安门城楼上也有一批摄影师摄取各种镜头。根据过去的经验，游行群众到达天安门前的时候，热烈情绪将达到最高潮。因此，有七个摄影师专门在这里摄取“高潮”的镜头。
    摄影师们还分别到庆祝大会的筹备机构和行将参加游行的各个组织中去了解情况。他们打听到，在游行队伍中，仪仗队的人们手持纸花，举起来将组成“五一”两个大字；“红领巾”们走到天安门的时候，将从手持的荷叶荷花中放出许多象征和平的鸽子，有一队红领巾将手执北京特有的玩具——风车；工人大队、农民大队将抬着表达他们在争取提前完成第一个五年计划中的新的生产成就和建设成就的模型；文艺大队将有象征“百花齐放”的各种各样的花篮、彩车和舞蹈；木偶剧团的木偶戏——猪八戒背媳妇，体育大队的花鼓，杂技队的大伞和大伞，中小运动员骑着独轮车，还有天安门的夜景，焰火，狂欢舞；等等，都已被列入摄取基本镜头的计划。
    从“五一”庆祝大会开始，他们的作业计划就要按小时计算了：十三点到十四点，第一批声画片（约一百二十公尺）到厂；十五点，第二批底片（约二千公尺）到厂；十六点，第三批底片（约二百二十公尺）到厂；……二十四点，最后一批底片到厂。二十点洗印出第一批样片；二十三点，洗印出第三批样片；5月2日四点半，洗印出最末一批样片。2日上午六点，编好样片，写好解说词；2日十一点，配好音乐音响；2日十八点，洗印好三套拷贝；十八点半审查完毕。这部影片预计在5月2日十九点可以和首都的电影观众见面；5月2日二十一点可以和天津的观众见面。5月4日或5日，洗印出来的更多的拷贝就可以在上海、沈阳、武汉等城市放映了。与此同时，制片厂还要洗印出一批素材来送给二十几个国家的电影制片厂。
    “五一”节在天安门拍摄电影的，除中央新闻纪录电影制片厂以外，北京电影制片厂将摄制一部分宽银幕电影镜头，苏联电影师还将摄制一部分五彩镜头。
    向全国广播实况
    “满街的广播喇叭在静静的养着嗓子，
    时间一到，它们要发出震天的声响。”
    这是诗人臧克家写的“迎接‘五一’”这首诗中的两句。
    广播电台的职工和北京市电器安装生产合作社的社员们，早在伏老来北京的前几天，就在北京街头装上了许多大喇叭。天安门广场和东西长安街，装了一百六十个；加上从东单到东四，从王府井大街到宽街，一共是二百六十个大喇叭。
    “五一”节的前几天，广播电台的同志们一次又一次地在试音和测验。测试结果，他们保证，不管“五一”节的天气怎么变化，甚至刮大风下大雨，全北京、全中国的广播听众，从上午九点四十五分起，都可以从收音机中收听到天安门前的实况。
    广播电台的同志们在天安门广场的乐队面前，在放礼炮的炮兵阵地上，在天安门上，都安装了许多话筒；为了能够收听到游行群众在天安门前的欢呼声和脚步声，他们还特意在华表顶上和华表座下的路边，安装了话筒。广播听众所熟悉的播音员——齐越和潘捷同志，将守候在天安门城楼右边旗杆下的话筒旁边，快要到十点钟的时候，当乐队奏起“东方红”的曲子以后，播音员就会宣布：毛主席和伏罗希洛夫主席走上天安门城楼了。接着，他们将把游行的实况陆续告诉听众。
    七十万朵花
    当游行的人们，举起手中的花束，向毛主席，向领导同志，向伏罗希洛夫主席，向所有的外国朋友欢呼的时候，你数过有多少朵花吗？你知道是谁培育出来的吗？也许你会回答我：像大海里的水滴一样数不清；是园丁培育出来的。这里，我要告诉你：一共有七十万朵；是北京艺光、第一绢纸花生产合作社的社员们在半个月内培育出来的，是他们给“五一”节的献礼。
    当你口渴的时候
    北京的5月，早晨还有些凉飕飕的，一到中午，阳光当头照射，汗水又会浸湿了衣裳。有经验的参加“五一”游行的人，早晨那餐点心，总多吃少喝。正午，游兴正浓，天气热起来了，肚子不饿，嘴却渴得难受。就在这舌焦唇干的时候，多么想喝一杯洁净凉爽的水，让歌儿唱得更嘹亮啊！多么想用手捧一捧凉水抹抹汗水流湿的脸啊！
    同志们！只要你们需要水，你们就放心的使用吧！在你们游行经过的马路旁边，在你们回家的路上，就有许多自来水龙头。这是北京市自来水公司特为大家准备的，全部水管一共有三十里长。水管里的水，经过放水冲刷、储水泡管，和卫生防疫部门化验，才安上龙头让大家饮用。喝这样干净的水，决不会把肚子喝坏。
    白熊冰棍上市
    今天，参加游行的人们，又可以在路旁的食品摊上买到北极白熊牌的冰棍了。这是北京食品厂的工人们特为节日赶制的。他们一共准备了三十万只冰棍，四百多公斤冰淇凌，还有足够的汽水和啤酒。
    群蝶闹星
    今天晚上，在天安门前看礼花的时候，如果你的孩子询问你，你可以这样告诉他：这一朵礼花，开头像一个降落伞，随后就有一团白光闪闪的大花蕊，像是月亮一样高悬在空中，紧接着在下边出现无数采色绚烂的小花朵，这种礼花，叫做“月下花园”。另一朵礼花，在空中爆炸后，随着出现千万条闪光，各处窜绕，这种花叫做“火龙”。
    你还可以告诉孩子，今天晚上一共有十大类，三千二百八十发礼花，有“和平花开”、“孔雀开屏”、“群蝶闹星”和各种颜色的菊花。这些都是一千里外一个工厂里的职工们精心制作的。
    美丽的夜公园
    同志，今天晚上，你准备参加天安门广场的晚会吗？那么，你就陪着你的爱人，带着你的孩子，或者拉着同学和朋友的手，尽情地唱吧、跳吧、舞吧！北京市电业局劳动模范张青带领的四十多位电灯安装工人，早就从北京饭店到府右街，沿路装上了六百多盏一千瓦的聚光灯。装在天安门、北京饭店、煤炭工业部、纺织工业部、人民银行、法院等高大建筑物上的“抅边电灯”，也严格检查过了，即使刮很大的风，下很大的雨，它们也同样大放光明。
    当你走进中山公园的时候，会发现今年“五一”节的夜晚，比往年的“五一”更加美丽。古老的中山堂的屋顶上，电灯工人们也给披上了“抅边串灯”。电灯安装工人和灯泡厂的工人们还共同在社稷坛五色土四周的牌坊上，用霓虹灯制成四只和平鸽。电门打开以后，它就自动展翅活动，像要飞起来一样。藤萝架两旁苍翠的古柏上，由往年的五色灯光齐放改成了一树一色，使人觉得更加幽雅，“保卫和平”石牌坊里面龙爪槐上的采色电灯，电压已经减低，光线更加柔和了。
    国际友人之家
    这几天，北京各大饭店门口的广场上，摆满着雪亮的大大小小的汽车，楼房穿上了彩色的服装，许多不同国籍不同肤色不同语言的国际朋友不断地出出进进。
    北京饭店的全体职工从4月20日就展开了竞赛。从宿舍到厨房，从家具到墙壁，通通打扫得一干二净。宾客服务组不分白天黑夜，为外宾擦皮鞋、熨衣服、买报纸、取药品，不论大事小事，随要随到。
    前门饭店这次要招待五百多位来自世界四十多个国家的外宾。早在“五一”节前，他们就增设了外文报刊售卖处，增加了办理电报、汇兑的人员，在小卖部增加了镜子、描眉笔、口红等三十多种商品。西餐厅的招待员这几天特别紧张。老年的招待员教给新招待员摆台布，放刀叉，学外文菜名；教给他们把餐巾叠成扇子面、白菜花、龙睛鱼、和平鸽等各种花样。去年暑假才从高小毕业的赵永珍，穿着蓝色的连衣裙，围着漂白的小围裙，熟练地在餐厅里走来走去。谁想得到这个同外宾有说有笑的小姑娘连外文字母都不懂得呢？
    一千人的清洁大队
    今天，首都将有百万以上的人走向街头。在黎明的时候，北京的大街小巷是清洁的；在游行队伍完全通过天安门以后的一个半小时，北京的大街小巷也将是清洁的。这是谁的功劳？是北京市一千人组成的清洁大队的功劳。
    从4月22日起到30日止，首都各主要街道，陆续出现了各种形式的厕所二百八十四组。有的像一座活动房屋，有的像一座篷帐。在这许多厕所中间，还有七辆汽车厕所。里面不仅有抽水马桶，而且有镜子、简单的盥洗和化装用物。装配这种汽车的零件，全部是从废物堆里找出来的，经过北京汽车装配厂职工的努力，这些废料就变成既漂亮又宽畅的汽车厕所了。
    在游行队伍的最后，还有一支由一百六十人组成的突击清扫队，只要游行队伍一过完，他们就进行突击清扫工作。他们提出的目标是：在游行结束后一个半小时内全部清扫完毕，并开始用洒水车洒水。那时，人们从东西长安大街，从王府井走过，谁会看得出有一百万人刚刚走过呢？  （本报记者）（附图片）
