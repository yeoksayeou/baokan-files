On Tiananmen Square
By Our Correspondent

Chairman Mao, Chairman Voroshilov, and other Party and government leaders of our country reviewed the parade of the capital's working people on Tiananmen Square yesterday.

The first to enter Tiananmen Square was the guard of honor. Old Voroshilov was very interested when he saw them. He said, "The steps of these girls are as neat as those of trained soldiers."

The ranks of the Young Pioneers entered the square. They held high the large slogan "Always Be Ready" and marched past Tiananmen, cheering. When Old Voroshilov saw this, he immediately said, "Yes! Children are our future. Chinese children are extremely lovely. As long as they are always ready, all problems will be solved."

The workers'队伍 poured in like a tide. Thousands of red flags fluttered in the wind amidst their ranks. Old Voroshilov said with great emotion, "These red flags represent the workers' class shedding much, much blood for the revolution and for the happiness of mankind."

A team of workers walked past, surrounded by a model of a large bridge. Old Voroshilov thought of the Wuhan Bridge. He turned to Chairman Mao and said, "I saw the Yangtze River Bridge in Wuhan. It's really great. There is no such bridge in the world." Chairman Mao listened and said, "It was built with the help of the Soviet Union." Old Voroshilov said, "There were only twenty-five of our people there. But there are hundreds of thousands of Chinese people. The real work was done by the Chinese people themselves." Chairman Mao said, "Your help is very important." Old Voroshilov said, "It is easy to help people like the Chinese people. You only need to help them a little, and they will do a great deal themselves."

Chairman Voroshilov saw a group of workers carrying a model of a generator. He said, "This generator can mobilize the inner heat of the people."

The farmers'队伍 came over. Voroshilov said to Chairman Mao, "I saw the Peasant Movement Training Institute in Guangzhou this time. To this day, the institute is still very well preserved." Chairman Mao said, "It has been thirty-two years now." Chairman Voroshilov said, "Seeing this scene on Tiananmen Square today shows that these thirty-two years have not been in vain. The efforts made by the people in the past thirty-two years have all blossomed and borne fruit today!" He exclaimed, "China, which has only been liberated for seven years, has done so much!" Then he said, "The reason why the people are so happy and so jubilant today is because things that no dynasty or emperor in history could do have been done today under the leadership of the Communist Party. It is the Communist Party that has enabled them to achieve such results today."

Many handicraftsmen carried huge models of cloisonné, lacquerware, jade articles, and other items to Tiananmen to receive the review. Chairman Voroshilov said, "In a large country like China, handicrafts are very important."

The队伍 of the industrial and commercial circles came over. They shouted slogans: "Long live the Chinese Communist Party!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" Chairman Voroshilov said to Chairman Mao, "The capitalists in China really surprised me: I went to many places, and many capitalists came to me and said, 'Fortunately, we have Marxism-Leninism, and we have the Communist Party, that we have such a happy life today. We must take the road of socialism, and we must follow the Communist Party.' These words really surprised me. Your policy of transforming the capitalists is really brilliant."

Having stood for too long, Chairman Mao invited Chairman Voroshilov to rest. Chairman Voroshilov always refused to rest. He said, "As long as I stand with you—Comrade Mao Zedong—I feel twenty-five or thirty years younger."

The student队伍 marched into the square, cheering. They carried signs that read "Good health, good study, good work," expressing their determination to cultivate themselves into well-rounded talents and to better serve the motherland. Chairman Mao said, "The world is going to depend on young people." Chairman Voroshilov said, "Young people are our future, our happiness!" Comrade Liu Shaoqi introduced from the side, "Many of the students in China are children of landlords and capitalists, but they are highly conscious." Chairman Voroshilov said, "Ideological work is very important. As long as the ideological problem is solved, everything will be easy to handle."

Chairman Voroshilov noticed the band standing opposite Tiananmen Square. From a distance, they had not moved for several hours. He said, "Only a disciplined people like the Chinese people can do this. They are simply like trees growing out of the ground, standing so steadily, without moving for several hours." Then he asked very concernedly, "Have those many people standing in the square eaten anything? Have they had any water?"

Thousands upon thousands of people marched past Tiananmen Square, cheering. Chairman Voroshilov said, "It is very important to unite all the forces of the people of the whole country to carry out national construction. And Communists should play an exemplary role in everything they do. The people pay attention to every move of the Communists, and the masses will always remember both the good impressions and the bad impressions." (Attached picture)

    在天安门上
    本报记者
    毛主席、伏罗希洛夫主席和我国其他党政领导同志，昨天在天安门上检阅了首都劳动人民的游行队伍。
    最先走进天安门广场的是仪仗队。伏老一见，很感兴趣。他说：“这些姑娘们的步伐，和受过训练的战士一样整齐。”
    少年儿童队员的队伍进入广场。他们高举着
  “时刻准备着”的大字标语，欢呼着走过天安门前。伏老见了，马上说：“是呀！儿童是我们的未来。中国的儿童可爱极了。只要他们时刻准备着，那一切问题都解决了。”
    工人的队伍像潮水一样涌来。千万面红旗在他们的队伍中间迎风飘扬。伏老很感慨地说：“这些红旗表示工人阶级为了革命，为了世界人类的幸福流了很多很多的血。”
    一队工人簇拥着一个大桥的模型走过来了。伏老想起武汉大桥。他转过身对毛主席说：“我在武汉看见长江大桥了。真是太好了。世界上还没有这样的桥。”毛主席听了说：“这是在苏联帮助下建设的。”伏老说：“那儿只有二十五个我们的人。而中国人却有几十万。真正的工作还是中国人民自己作的。”毛主席说：“你们的帮助很重要。”伏老说：“像中国人民这样的人民，帮助也好帮助。你只要帮他一下，他自己就会干一大堆。”
    伏罗希洛夫主席看见一群工人抬着一个发电机模型，他说：“这发电机可以把人民内心的热力发动起来。”
    农民的队伍过来了。伏罗希洛夫对毛主席说：“我这次在广州看到农民讲习所，一直到今天，讲习所还保存得很好。”毛主席说：“到现在已经过去三十二年了。”伏罗希洛夫主席说：“今天在天安门上看见这种场面，这说明三十二年没有白过。三十二年来人民所作的努力，今天都开花结果了。”他赞叹地说：“刚刚解放了七年的中国就作了这么许多事！”接着又说：“今天人民所以这样高兴，这样狂欢，就是因为历史上任何王朝和皇帝办不到的事，今天在共产党领导下都办到了。有了共产党才使他们得到今天这样的成果。”
    许许多多手工业工人抬着景泰蓝、漆器、玉器等巨大的模型来天安门接受检阅。伏罗希洛夫主席说：“像中国这样的大国，手工业是非常重要的。”
    工商界的队伍过来了。他们高呼着：“中国共产党万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”的口号。伏罗希洛夫主席对毛主席说：“中国的资本家真使我惊奇：我到许多地方，好多资本家都来找我，还对我说，幸亏有了马列主义，有了共产党，我们才有了今天这样的幸福生活。我们一定要走社会主义的路，我们一定要跟共产党走。这些话实在让我惊奇。你们对资本家的改造政策实在太英明了。”
    站的太久了，毛主席请伏罗希洛夫主席休息休息。伏罗希洛夫主席总不肯休息。他说：“我只要和你——毛泽东同志站在一起，我就像年青了二十五岁或者三十岁。”
    学生队伍欢呼着走进广场。他们抬着“身体好、学习好、工作好”的标语牌，表示他们决心把自己培养成为全面发展的人材，更好地为祖国服务的决心。毛主席说：“世界是要靠青年的。”伏罗希洛夫主席说：“青年是我们的未来，是我们的幸福！”刘少奇同志在旁面介绍说：“中国的学生有不少是地主、资本家的子女，但觉悟很高。”伏罗希洛夫主席说：“思想工作很重要，只要思想问题解决了，一切都好办。”
    伏罗希洛夫主席注意到站在天安门广场对面的乐队，远远看去，几个钟头一动也不动，他说：
  “只有像中国这样有纪律的人民才能作到这一点。他们简直像从地底下长出来的树一样，站得那么稳，几个钟头动都不动。”接着他又很关切地问：“站在广场的那许多人，他们站了那么久，有没有吃东西？有没有喝水？”
    千千万万的人在天安门前欢呼着走过去了。伏罗希洛夫主席说：“把全国人民所有的力量都团结起来，进行国家建设，这是很重要的一件事情。而共产党员在工作上事事应起模范作用。共产党员的一举一动人民都很注意，无论是好的印象、坏的印象群众是永远都记得的。”（附图片）
