Ding Guitang Speaks:
The Communist Party is Great, Wise, and Correct, But Not Every Party Member Is

The Party headed by Chairman Mao is great, and its policies and guidelines are wise. Any Chinese person with a patriotic heart can be sure to wholeheartedly and sincerely support the leadership of the Communist Party.

Of course, not all Communist Party members are wise and correct. Nor can every Party member represent the Communist Party as being so wise and correct.

I myself completely believe in the great and wise Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the People's Government; I am also very grateful for the care the Party and government have shown me. I have always believed in the Party. There cannot be deviations and errors in the work of the Party and its members; but I also believe that these deviations and errors will be corrected sooner or later. The current rectification campaign is clear evidence of this. In the past, some Communist Party members had subjectivism, sectarianism, and bureaucracy, which was wrong, but I had long believed that these errors would be corrected sooner or later. Today it is indeed so.

The opinions I am expressing today may be one-sided. Although I have been one of the Deputy Directors-General for the past few years, I do not have a comprehensive grasp of the General Administration's work, and it is impossible to fully understand the Party's policies and guidelines, so my opinions may be incorrect, or even wrong. In order to respond to the Party's call, in the spirit of "say all you know and say it without reservation," and for the sake of cherishing the Party and its members, I boldly put forward my personal opinions. These opinions do not represent my organization. If there are deviations or errors, they are only for the Party committee to refer to and give guidance.

The General Administration of Customs has leading cadres and general cadres, both Party and non-Party. What I want to talk about now are mainly the Party member leading cadres and general Party members.

After liberation, the people's customs service was built from scratch. All administrative operations have regulations and systems, which should be attributed to the Party member cadres, and of course, also to the contributions of non-Party cadres.

Why is Priority Given to Whether Someone is a Party or League Member When Promoting, Cultivating, and Using Cadres?

Sectarianism among Communist Party members in the General Administration of Customs is quite serious. It is manifested in several aspects:

First, there is a distinction between Party members and non-Party members in the promotion of cadres. In the more than seven years since the establishment of the General Administration of Customs, no one who originally transferred from the old customs has ever been promoted by two or three grades at once. However, Party and League members have been promoted by three grades in succession. Last year, seven or eight deputy section chiefs were promoted, all of whom were Party members, and not a single one was a non-Party member. Except for one or two non-Party members appointed during the early days of liberation, no non-Party members have been promoted to the positions of customs director or deputy director. Now, non-Party members account for 50% of the General Administration of Customs. Apart from the old, weak, and disabled, is there not a single non-Party member who can be promoted? When a cadre is promoted, the first consideration is whether he or she is a Party or League member. If so, even if their talent is a little lacking, it is acceptable. In the past, there were four deputy section chiefs in the Statistics, Tax Policy, and Anti-Smuggling Departments who were quite capable non-Party cadres. Two years ago, for some reason, they were transferred to be specialists. The authority of a specialist is not clearly defined, so it is generally believed that a specialist is lower than a deputy section chief. Everyone also believes that they were demoted from deputy section chief to specialist.

Second, in the cultivation of cadres, whether it is in-service cadre training classes or foreign language training classes, most of the students are Party members, and the number of non-Party members is extremely small. The small number is obvious at a glance. Currently, there are only eight non-Party members among the forty-six students in the cadre training class. Of course, Party members and League members have a bright future, and it is right for the country to trust them. However, among the more than one thousand non-Party cadres in the General Administration of Customs, are there only these few who have a future? Why not cultivate them?

Third, in the use of cadres, when the General Administration of Customs convenes various specialized and professional meetings, the participants are all Party members and League members. When central government agencies hold meetings, we do not have the opportunity to participate, and Party members are sent instead. Non-Party section chiefs, and even I, as a deputy director-general, have not attended a single business meeting convened by the central government since 1953. Many colleagues from the old customs understand foreign languages, especially English, but their knowledge and abilities have not been well utilized. In recent years, when the General Administration sends people to inspect the situation in various places, most of them are led by Party member leading cadres. Except for my visit at the beginning of 1951, I have not gone again. I am a representative of the People's Congress, but every time I go out to inspect in my capacity as a representative, the leadership has never asked me to inspect the customs. I did, however, take the initiative to learn about the situation of Dalian Customs when I went to Dalian; I reported this to the leadership, but it was ignored. The problem of Dalian Customs having too few people and too many tasks was not resolved until Party member cadres went to inspect.

I Have a Title But Little Power and Must Be Responsible; Party Member Section Chiefs Are Harsh with Me

Fourth, non-Party leading cadres have a title but no power. Among the four Directors-General and Deputy Directors-General, I am the only one who is not a Communist Party member. In the early days of liberation (1949-1953), I had both a title and power. I managed many things, even things that I should not have managed. After the General Administration of Customs became part of the Ministry of Foreign Trade, my power and title became disproportionate, and even weakened. In 1953, I led the National Joint Anti-Smuggling Conference. However, the summary of this meeting was not discussed with me in advance, and the draft was not shown to me either. It was not until half a year later, when the entire text had been printed, that I was given a copy. In 1953, I was one of the members of the presidium for the Customs Affairs Conference, and I led the meeting every day. The summary report of the meeting was made under the leadership of Deputy Minister Lei, and I was not allowed to participate in the summary work at all. After the summary report was drafted, I was asked to express my opinion. I expressed my opinion, but I don't know if it was adopted. I have a title, but the "power" is very questionable, and I am still responsible. If others do well, there is no problem; but if they make mistakes, I am responsible. For example, I did not see the telegram from Minister Kong to his family seeking opinions on the issue of tariff reciprocity with Indonesia. I also did not know about the reply telegram from the General Administration of Customs. After Minister Kong returned, Premier Zhou believed that this matter had not been handled correctly, and Minister Kong blamed me for it. My rebuttal was useless. Fortunately, I was not punished. This is what it means to have a title but no power and be responsible. Who told me not to know! I lead three departments, and I often review and revise official documents. However, Section Chief Ma Fuyuan (Communist Party member) often came to question me about why I made such changes. The department also never consulted me about problems. I have told Ma Fuyuan many times, "Let's discuss problems together," but he never came. When I submitted my opinions, they either said that I did not understand the policies or that I did not understand the business. I have been in the customs service for forty-one years, and I understand some business. However, Deputy Section Chief Chen Tiebao (Communist Party member) of the General Administration of Customs even spoke to me harshly sometimes. Party member section chiefs often did not ask for instructions or report, and sometimes I did not even know when they went on business trips.

Between Party Members and Non-Party Cadres, the Wall is High and Thick, and the Ditch is Deep and Wide

Fifth, the relationship between Party members among leaders, and between leaders and those led, is basically that there is no contact with each other, only official business. There has been no heart-to-heart talk or ideological exchange. The wall in the General Administration is high and thick; the ditch is deep and wide. Although there is no friction in official business, there is no communication in our hearts. In private interactions, not only is there no closeness, there is no interaction at all. Only a few Party member comrades greet us with a "Congratulations, get rich" during the Spring Festival.

The administrative side and the Communist Party organization of the General Administration of Customs do not value democratic parties and groups. They just feel that they are dispensable. If democratic parties strive for something, they are led; if they do not strive for something, they are left alone. Even posting a notice for the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang on the blackboard newspaper is opposed by Communist Party members.

For seven years, I had power for the first three and a half years, and for the last three and a half years, I had a title, half power, and responsibility. I myself am old (68 years old by Chinese reckoning, 65 and a half years old in reality), I am slow to progress, I am backward, and my thinking is old-fashioned. It is not easy to immediately dig out the old things, so I also have subjective problems.

Making Subjective Judgments Without Investigation and Research; Not Trusting Anything Old

The manifestation of subjectivism in the General Administration of Customs is:

First, not investigating, not researching, and making subjective judgments. The nature of the old customs was bad (it served imperialism and bureaucratic capitalism), and the role it played was also quite bad. However, it should not negate all of its methods. Now, some people, upon hearing that something is old, wave their hands and say it won't work. Chairman Mao said that we should also learn the science of capitalist countries, and even their good literature. Can't we critically accept their methods in the customs service?

Second, not trusting cadres who transferred from the old customs, especially those who held high positions in the past. Saying that since we are not Kuomintang members, but can climb to such high positions, it is impossible without colluding with foreigners. In fact, the situation of the old customs is that, except for those who worked in the confidential departments of the General Administration of Customs, others do not understand the situation within the customs. Now, the retirement regulations stipulate that anyone who has served as a customs commissioner is an old official. Even if they worked for a hundred years at the time, their years of service cannot be counted as labor years. This is completely subjectivism. In fact, foreigners at the time were just using us by "making us do things, but not letting us know why." Foreigners did not need to collude with Chinese people at all, because they could do whatever they wanted. Even if individual Chinese people tried to get close to them, it was just flattery. At that time, the American Inspector General of Customs signed official documents with a red pencil, but I was forbidden to sign official documents with a red pencil. Because in their eyes, red pencils were for principal officials to use. I couldn't even use a red pencil, so what authority did I have? But during the suppression of counter-revolutionaries last year, they still suspected us of colluding with foreigners. After I joined the People's Customs, I wrote an autobiography in which I wrote about my past struggles with foreigners and the fact that I donated money to the 19th Route Army, the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army, and the New Fourth Army during the War of Resistance Against Japan. Some people said that I was exaggerating. In fact, these are all true.

According to regulations, the old customs sent written reports to the General Administration of Customs every year, every quarter, and every month from all customs offices. The reports were about local customs, military affairs, droughts, floods, and other situations. The General Administration of Customs compiled these situations into册 and distributed them publicly, including to foreign countries. After liberation, this work was considered to be sending intelligence to foreigners. Usually, when we wrote English letters to foreigners, we generally addressed them as "Dear Mr." and signed off with "Your faithfully." Translating these words into Chinese as "亲爱的先生" (Dear Mr.) and "你的忠实的" (Your faithfully), it was used as evidence that our relationship with foreigners was very intimate and collusive. In fact, this is general international etiquette. Doesn't Premier Zhou often call foreigners "dear" in diplomatic exchanges?

Subjectivism is also manifested in mechanically copying the experience of other countries, such as the recently drafted customs law.

The performance of the Party member leading cadres of the General Administration of Customs in bureaucracy: the leadership is not very close to the non-Party masses. Only a few reports are made to a few people at the General Administration's meetings. The work of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang is not asked about at all. Deputy Minister Li once said to me: "Old Ding! Old Ding! You have read a lot of books!" At the time, I was too embarrassed to say: Why don't you give me work to do!

Party Members Think of Themselves as Special Material; They Look Down on Non-Party Cadres Too Much

Some Party members, as Stalin said, feel that they are made of "special material." I think they are different from others. But we should also study what "special material" they are made of. They always feel that "I am the greatest," "I won the world." They are proud and complacent, and this is what makes them different from others.

Party members do not look at problems from the perspective of development when dealing with non-Party people. They often scold us "backward elements" behind our backs and underestimate us too much. Of course, it cannot be said that we are better than Party members. However, I can proudly say that my awareness has improved. Otherwise, I would not dare to say these words today, and I would be afraid of being criticized tomorrow for saying these words. This is also the result of my studying at the Socialism Academy for half a year.

I hope that Party members will see us as Chinese people who love the country as much as they do. If we did not love the Party and the country, I would not say these words. We are completely committed to taking the socialist road. Our "ambition" lies in building socialism, and we should all be comrades. Strictly speaking, Party members and Party members are comrades; broadly speaking, everyone is a comrade.

My second hope is that non-Party people should not be underestimated too much. They are making progress and are useful.

I believe that the Party will certainly be able to do the above two points. As long as these two points are achieved, deep ditches can be filled, rain will not seep in, and even the highest walls will be torn down.

Silently, Stealing Beams and Pillars, Reducing the General Administration to a Bureau Level

I am not here to fight for power and profit; however, I have opinions on the leadership of the Ministry of Foreign Trade regarding the structure and personnel of the General Administration of Customs. In the past, the General Administration of Customs was directly under the Government Administration Council, and I was also treated as a Deputy Minister. When the General Administration of Customs was merged into the Ministry of Foreign Trade, Premier Zhou said that the political treatment of the General Administration of Customs would not change. Later, Elder Ye came to the General Administration and personally said at the General Administration's meeting that the treatment of the General Administration of Customs personnel would not change. However, after the merger, the Personnel Department of the Ministry invisibly reduced the General Administration to a bureau level. Although the salary has not changed, the political treatment has been lowered. This is simply a silent and stealing beams and pillars approach. In fact, changing it is fine, but it should be explained, and it is fine to call me a section chief.

Who is ultimately in charge of the personnel of the General Administration of Customs? Who is in charge of the treatment and promotion of cadres at the customs offices? I don't even know when the directors of the customs offices are transferred away casually by the local authorities. Sometimes, I don't even know that all the leading cadres of a customs office have been transferred away.

The ministry also does not pay attention to the work of democratic parties and groups such as the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang. It rarely seeks the opinions of democrats.

Too Many Directors-General, Overstaffing; The Three-Anti and Five-Anti Campaigns and the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries Should Be Concluded Soon

I feel that there are too many Directors-General in the General Administration of Customs, and there is overstaffing. It was originally said that only two Directors-General were needed, but now there are four. Is it because there are too many people in the ministry and there is no way to arrange them? If so, I can be transferred away. I come from a peasant family and I am willing to go to the countryside.

I rarely attend ministry meetings, and I hope to be able to attend in the future. I also can't see some of the business telegrams. I am also an important leader, and if I don't understand the policies and guidelines, I am not qualified.

I feel that the leading comrades of the ministry and bureaus are very interested in the issue of tax exemptions and often approve tax exemptions casually. It is a matter of national taxation, and tax exemptions should not be too broad, whether for private individuals or public organizations.

In addition, there are still individual cases that have not been concluded for those who were criticized during the Three-Anti and Five-Anti Campaigns and the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries, and these people are very uneasy. During the Three-Anti Campaign, one person was considered to be corrupt and sent to the court, and the court acquitted him. However, the General Administration of Customs neither appealed nor enforced the judgment. During the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries, some people were suspected but had no problems in reality, and some had not made confessions. These people are also dissatisfied with the Party. In order to turn negative factors into positive factors and strive for socialist construction, these issues should be addressed.

专栏：

    丁贵堂发言：
    共产党是伟大英明正确的  可是并非每个党员都如此
    以毛主席为首的党是伟大的，方针、政策都英明。凡有爱国心的中国人，可断定都全心全意、心悦诚服地拥护共产党的领导。
    当然，不是所有的共产党员都是英明正确的。也不是每个党员都能代表共产党那样英明正确。
    我本人对伟大英明的共产党和毛主席和人民政府完全相信；党和政府对我的照顾我也很感激。我一直是相信党的。党和党员工作中不可能没有偏差错误；但我也相信这些偏差错误早晚一定会纠正的。现在要整风，就是明显的事实。过去有些共产党员有主观主义、宗派主义、官僚主义，这是不对的，但是我早就相信，这些错误早晚会纠正的。今天果然如此。
    我今天发表的意见，很可能是片面的。近几年来，我虽然是副署长之一，但是对总署的业务不是全面掌握，不可能全面了解党的政策和方针，所以意见可能是不正确的，甚至是错误的。为了响应党的号召，本着“知无不言，言无不尽”精神，为了爱护党和党员起见，我大胆地提出个人的意见。这些意见并不代表我的组织。如果有偏差错误，仅供党委参考、指教。
    海关总署有党和非党的领导干部和一般干部。我现在要说的主要是党员领导干部和一般党员。
    解放后，人民海关事业一切都是草创。一切行政业务都有了规章制度，这应归功于党员干部，当然也有非党干部的贡献。
    提拔、培养、使用干部为何先考虑是否党团员
    海关总署共产党员的宗派主义相当严重。表现在几个方面：
    第一，在提拔干部上，有党员与非党员之分。海关总署成立七年多，原来由旧海关转过来的人员，绝对没有一次升两三级的。而党团员，却有连升三级的。去年提拔七八个副处长，都是党员，没一个是非党员。各关关长、副关长，除了刚解放的时候任命过一两位非党员以外，没有提升过一个非党员。现在海关总署的非党员占50％。除老弱残兵外，是不是没有一个非党员可提升的呢？一个干部升级，先考虑他是不是党团员。如果是，即使才学缺一点，也可以。过去统计、税政、查私处有四位副处长，都是相当有本事的非党干部。两年前，不知道为什么把他们调为专员。专员的职权是没有一定的规定的，所以一般认为专员低于副处长。大家也认为他们是由副处长降成了专员。
    第二，在培养干部上，无论是在职干部训练班或外文训练班的学员，多半是党员，非党员为数极少。数目之小，一看就知。现在干部训练班四十六人中，只有八个非党团员。当然，党团员前途远大，国家信任他们是应该的。但是，海关总署内的一千多非党干部中，就只有这几个有前途的？为什么不培养他们？
    第三，在使用干部上，海关总署召开各种专门、专业会议时，参加的人都是党团员。中央各机关开会时，我们没有机会参加，也是派党员去。非党处长，甚至连我这个副署长，从1953年以后连一次中央召开的业务会都没参加过。旧海关的同事们，多懂外文，尤其是英文，他们的这些学识和能力没有被好好利用。近年来署里派人到各地视察情况，大多数由党员领导干部领着下去。我除1951年年初去过外，就没再去过。我是人民代表大会的代表，每次以代表资格出去视察的时候，领导上也从来没有要我去视察海关。我倒是在去大连的时候，主动地了解了一些大连关的情况；把这些向领导汇报，也置之不理。大连关事多人少，这问题直到党员干部去视察后才解决。
    我是有职少权而要负责  党员处长对我声色俱厉
    第四，非党领导干部是有职无权。四位署长和副署长中，只有我不是共产党员。在解放初期（1949年——1953年），我是有职有权的，很多事情由我管，甚至不该我管的也管了。从海关总署成为外贸部的一部分以后，我的权与职就不相称，甚至削弱了。1953年开全国联合查私会议，是由我领导的。可是这个会议的总结，事先并没有同我商量，草稿也不给我看。直到半年以后，全文都打印好了才给我一份。1953年，开海关关务会，我是主席团之一，天天领导开会。会议的总结报告，是由雷副部长领导作的，根本不准我参加总结工作。总结报告都打好后，才叫我表示意见。我表示了意见，也不知道采纳了没有。我是有职了，但是“权”很成问题，责任还是有我的。别人作的事，好了没问题；错了却由我负责。比如孔部长到印度尼西亚谈判关税互惠问题向家里征求意见的电报，我根本没有看见。海关总署回的电报，我也不知道。孔部长回来后，周总理认为这件事没作对，孔部长就把责任扣在我头上，我辩驳也没用。好在没给我处分。这就是有职无权而有责。谁叫我不知道呢！我领导三个处，也常批改一些公文。可是，我改的公文，处长马福元（共产党员）常常跑来责问我为什么要这么改。处里有问题也从不向我请示。我给马福元说过多少次“有问题大家商量商量，可是他也不来，我的意见交下去，他们不是说我不懂政策，就是说我不懂业务。我在海关呆了四十一年，多少也懂一些业务。可是，总署副处长陈铁保（共产党员）甚至有时对我说话声色俱厉。党员处长常常不请示报告，甚至有时候他们出差去了我也不知道。
    党员和非党干部之间  墙高而厚，沟深而宽
    第五，领导者之间、领导者和被领导者之间的党群关系，基本上是彼此没有来往，仅仅是公事公办。没有谈过心，沟通过思想。总署的墙高而厚；沟深而宽。虽然公事上没有磨擦，暗中心里却不相通。在私人往来上，不但谈不到密切，根本没有交往。只有个别党员同志在春节时同我们彼此拜拜年，说声“恭喜恭喜，发财”而已。
    海关总署的行政方面和共产党组织对民主党派都不重视，只是觉得它可有可无。民主党派争取一下就领导一下，不争取就完。黑板报上给民革登一个通知，也遭到共产党员反对。
    七年来，我是前三年半有权，后三年半是有职半有权而有责。我自己年岁大了（虚岁六十八岁，实岁六十五岁半），进步慢，落后，脑筋都是老一套，把旧东西马上挖出去是不容易的，所以，我主观上也有问题。
    不调查研究就主观臆断  对旧事旧人一概不相信
    主观主义在海关总署中的表现是：
    第一，不调查，不研究，主观臆断。旧海关的本质是恶劣的（它是为帝国主义、官僚资本主义服务的），它所起的作用也相当坏。但是，不应该否定它所有的一切办法。现在有些人一听说是旧的，就“呃”的一声摆手说不行。毛主席说，资本主义国家的科学我们也应该学，甚至他们的好的文学也要学嘛。难道他们在海关中的办法，就不能批判地接受？
    第二，对旧海关转过来的干部不相信。尤其是对过去担任过高级职务的。说我们既不是国民党员，而能爬上这样高的职位，如果不勾结外国人，是不可能的。其实，旧海关的情况是除在海关总署的机要部门工作的以外，其他的人并不了解海关内的情况。现在退休条例规定，凡是作过海关税务司的人员，都是旧官吏，虽然当时作了一百年，也不能算劳动年限，这完全是主观主义。其实，当时外国人对我们不过是“使由之，不使知之”的利用我们。外国人根本用不着与中国人勾结，因为他可以为所欲为。即使个别中国人去亲近他们，也不过是拍马屁而已。当时总税务司的美国人用红铅笔签署公文，而我就被禁止用红铅笔签公文。因为在他们看来红铅笔是主官用的。我连用红铅笔都办不到，有何职权可言？但是去年肃反，仍然怀疑我们同外国人有勾结。我参加人民海关工作后，曾经写了一份自传，其中写了我过去同外人斗争和抗战期间我捐款给十九路军、东北义勇军、新四军的情况，有人就说我夸大其词。其实，这些都是真实的。
    旧海关，按例，各关各口，每年每季每月，都送书面报告给海关总署。报告中都是关于地方风土人情、军事、旱灾、水灾等情况。总署就把这些情况编印成册公开发行，也发行到外国。解放后，就被认为这个工作是给外国人送情报。平常我们给外国人写英文信，一般都称呼Dearmr·，下款署名是Your faithfully这几个字译成中文是“亲爱的先生”，和“你的忠实的”。因此，就以此为证说我们同外国人的关系很亲昵，有勾结。其实，这是一般的国际交际用语，周总理在外交往来上不是也常称外国人“亲爱的”吗？
    主观主义还表现在机械地搬用别国的经验，比如新近草拟的海关法草案就是如此。
    海关总署的党员领导干部在官僚主义上的表现：领导上对非党群众很不接近。仅在署务会议上，对少数人作一些报告。对民革工作根本不过问。李副部长曾对我说：“丁老！老丁！你看了很多书啊！”当时我没好意思说：为什么不给我工作做呢！
    党员自认为是特别材料  把非党干部看得太低了
    有些党员，正如斯大林所说，觉得自己是用“特别材料”作成的。我觉得他们与别人是不一样。但也应该研究研究是什么“特别材料”。他们总觉得“老子天下第一”，“天下是老子打的”。他们骄傲自满，这就是他们与别人不同的地方。
    党员对非党人士，不从发展看问题。常常背后骂我们“落后分子”，把我们估计得太低了。当然，决不能说我们比党员高。但是，我可以自傲地说，我的觉悟是有所提高的。不然，我今天就不敢说这些话，就会害怕说了这些话明天挨斗。这也是我在社会主义学院学习半年的结果吧。
    我希望党员要把我们看成是同他们一样地爱国的中国人。如果我们不爱党、爱国，我就不讲这些话了。我们完全是志同道合的走社会主义的道路的。我们的“志”都在于建设社会主义，我们应该都是同志。严格地说，党员和党员是同志；广义地说，大家都是同志。
    我的第二点希望，就是不要把非党人士估计太低。他们是有进步的，有用处的。
    以上两点，我相信党一定能作到。只要作到这两点，深沟也能填平，下雨也不会渗进去，墙再高也会拆掉。
    不声不响，偷梁换柱  把总署降成了局一级
    我不是来争权夺利；可是，我对外贸部的领导关于海关总署的机构人事问题是有意见的。过去海关总署直属政务院，对我也是副部长待遇。海关总署归并到外贸部时，周总理曾说，海关总署的政治待遇不动。后来叶老来署，在署务会议上也亲自说，海关总署人员待遇不变。可是，合并以后，部里的人事处无形中把署降为局一级的了。工资虽然没变，政治待遇却低了。这简直是不声不响、偷梁换柱的作法。其实，变也可以，应该交代一下，叫我作科长也可以。
    到底海关总署人事归谁管？各关干部待遇和升级由谁管？各关关长，甚至随便被地方调走了我也不知道。有时一个关的领导干部都调走了，我也不晓得。
    部里对民革等民主党派的工作也不重视。很少征求民主人士意见。
    署长太多，人浮于事  三反、肃反应早结案
    我觉得海关总署的署长太多，人浮于事。原来说只要两个署长，现在是四个。是不是因为部内人多了无法安插？如果是这样，可以把我调走。我是农家出身，愿意到乡下去。
    我很少参加部务会议，希望今后能参加。有些业务电报我也看不到。我也是重要领导人，如不了解方针政策，就不称职。
    我感到部、局的领导同志对免税问题很感兴趣，常常随便批准免税。事关国税，无论对私人免税和公家免税，都不应太宽。
    此外，三反、肃反的时候被斗的对象，还有个别未结案的，这些人心绪很不安。三反时有一个人被认为贪污送到法院，法院判无罪。但海关总署既不上诉，也不执行判决。肃反时有些人被怀疑而实际上没问题的，也有些未作交代。这些人也对党不满。为了变消极因素为积极因素，为建设社会主义努力，对这些问题应作交代。
