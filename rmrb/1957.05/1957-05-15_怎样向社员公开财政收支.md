Publicize Revenue and Expenditure Item by Item
Simple and Easy to Understand

    This newspaper reports that the Guoguang Agricultural Cooperative in Ganshan Township, Deqing County, Zhejiang Province, recently adopted the method of "publicizing revenue and expenditure item by item" to publicize the cooperative's financial revenue and expenditure, which was warmly welcomed by the members.
    In the past, this cooperative did not promptly publicize the cooperative's financial revenue and expenditure, nor did it discuss it among the members, which caused some members to have some doubts about the accounts and dampened their enthusiasm for production.
    After the Central Committee's notice on the three measures for running cooperatives democratically was delivered to the township, the cooperative's cadres conducted a serious study. Through the study, the cooperative cadres realized the importance of promptly publicizing financial revenue and expenditure, and immediately accepted the members' opinions. After repeated research, they decided to adopt the method of formulating small financial plans and publicizing revenue and expenditure item by item to promptly publicize financial revenue and expenditure to the members. The specific method is: formulate a financial revenue and expenditure plan at the beginning of each month and publicize it to the members; at the end of the month, publicize the implementation situation to the members item by item and listen to the members' opinions; if there are any temporary large cash revenue or expenditure situations (such as the revenue and expenditure of advance purchase payments for spring cocoons, early rice, etc.), immediately publicize them to the members item by item. Because this method is simple and easy to understand, it has been widely welcomed by the members. For example, the members' response was very good to the recent timely publicity of the revenue and expenditure of advance purchase payments for spring cocoons item by item. They said: By publicizing the accounts in this way, we not only understand the cooperative's income, but also know the cooperative's expenditure, which makes us feel at ease!

    Accountant Reports Accounts Door-to-Door
    Members' Doubts Eliminated
    This newspaper reports that, according to the Inner Mongolia Daily: The accountant of the Kangshengzhuang Agricultural Cooperative in Qingshuihe County, Inner Mongolia, carried account books to all the cooperative's natural villages to publicize the accounts to the members, which was welcomed by the members.
    This agricultural cooperative had not publicized the accounts for a long time after the dividends were distributed. The members had many questions about their annual income and went to the cooperative to settle the accounts one after another. The accountant was annoyed by the noise and had a blunt attitude. The members suspected that the cooperative cadres had embezzled money, otherwise why wouldn't they publicize the accounts? According to the urgent request of the members, the management committee asked the accountant to take the account books and receipts to each team to publicize the accounts to the eighty-five members. When the accountant publicized the accounts, the members listened attentively, and the production team leader, group leader, and work recorder checked the original receipts item by item. If there were any questions, the accountant explained them. If any discrepancies were found, they were checked and corrected. The above was publicized orally. In addition, under the supervision of the cooperative director and deputy director, all the accounts were checked clearly before being publicized in writing.
    The members welcomed the accountant's door-to-door reporting of accounts, and generally reflected that they felt comfortable and clear-headed. No one in the cooperative was clamoring to find the accounts anymore.
   "Everyone Knows Every Month"
    Mistakes Can Also Be Corrected
    This newspaper reports that the Huohua Agricultural Cooperative in Duwei Township, Nanchong City, Sichuan Province, recently developed a new method of publicizing accounts called "Everyone Knows Every Month." This new method has been adopted by most agricultural cooperatives in the Nanchong Special Zone.
    In the past, the Huohua Cooperative generally adopted the method of publicizing accounts to the members by accounting subject and preparing a statement of revenue and expenditure. Most members could not understand it and could not see the problems. Although the members were concerned about the cooperative's financial revenue and expenditure, they were not interested in this method of publicity. In order to solve this problem, the cooperative's financial cadres, with the help of cadres engaged in financial work in the Rural Work Department of the Nanchong Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China, developed a form called "Everyone Knows Every Month." This form is divided into two parts, one part for the cooperative and one part for the production team. The accounts are very specific and do not rigidly follow accounting subjects. The cooperative's sideline income accounts are not publicized as a large sum in general terms, but are separately written out with the amount of each income such as transportation and milk, so that everyone can understand. Because the forms are fixed and uniform, it is very convenient for the team to keep accounts, summarize, and report accounts, and the cooperative can also publicize the accounts to the members every month.
    The Huohua Cooperative recently adopted this method to publicize the accounts to the members, which was unanimously welcomed by the members. Member Qin Haiqing said: "Report the accounts once a month, and mistakes can also be corrected."

    怎样向社员公开财政收支
    收支逐笔公开
    又简便又好懂
    本报讯　浙江德清县干山乡国光农业社，最近采用“收支逐笔公开”的办法公布社里的财政收支情况，受到了社员们的热烈欢迎。
    这个社在过去对于社里的财政收支情况，既没有作到及时公开，更没有在社员中进行过讨论，因此使部分社员对账目产生了某些疑虑，生产情绪不高。
    中央关于民主办社的三项措施的通知下达到乡以后，这个社的干部进行了一次认真的学习。通过学习，社干部认识了及时公开财政收支的重要意义，当即接受社员们的意见，经过反复研究，决定采取制定财务小段计划和收支逐笔公开的办法，来向社员及时公布财政收支。具体作法是：每月初制定一次财务收支计划，并向社员公布；月底再向社员逐笔公布执行情况，听取社员意见；如遇有临时性的大笔现金的收入或支出情况（如春茧、早稻等预购款收支等），立即逐笔向社员进行公布。由于这一办法简便易懂，因而受到了社员们的普遍欢迎。如最近及时向社员逐笔公布了春蚕预购款的收支情况，社员们的反映就很好。他们说：这样公布账目，我们不光了解了社的收入，还知道了社的支出，这可算放心啦！

    会计临门报账
    社员疑虑消除
    本报讯　据内蒙古日报报道：内蒙古清水河县康盛庄农业社的会计，携带账簿深入全社各自然村，向社员公布账目，受到社员欢迎。
    这个农业社在分完红以后长期没有公布账目，社员们对自己一年收入有很多疑问，纷纷找到社里算账，会计被吵得不耐烦，态度生硬，社员们就怀疑社干贪污了，不然为甚么不公布账目？管理委员会根据社员的迫切要求，叫会计带上账簿、单据深入各队向八十五户社员公布账目。会计公布账目的时候，社员在旁倾听，生产队长、组长和记工员手拿原始单据逐笔核对，如有疑问由会计交代，发现长短核查清楚更正。以上是用口头公布的，此外，在社主任、副主任的监督下，全部账目核清后再作书面公布。
    社员们对于会计临门报账表示欢迎，普遍反映心里舒服亮堂。社里再没有吵闹着找账的人了。
   “月月都知道”
    错了也好改
    本报讯　四川南充市都尉乡火花农业社，最近研究出一种名叫 “月月都知道”的公布账目的新方法。这一新方法，已为南充专区的大部分农业社所采用。
    火花社以往一般是采用按会计科目、编制收支对照表向社员公布的办法，多数社员听不懂也看不出问题。社员虽然关心社里财务收支情况，但却对这种公布方法不感兴趣。为了解决这一问题，社里的财务干部，在中共南充地委农村工作部搞财会工作的干部的帮助下，研究制订了一种叫做“月月都知道”的表格。这种表格分两部分，一部分是社里的，一部分是生产队的。账目都很具体，不硬搬会计科目。全社的副业收入账目，不是笼统地公布一个大数目，而是分别写明运输、牛奶等各项收入的数目，人人都可以看懂。由于表格固定和统一，队里记账、汇总、报账都很方便，社里也可以作到月月向社员公布账目。
    火花社最近采取这种办法向社员公布账目，受到了社员们的一致欢迎。社员覃海清说：“一月报一次账，错了也好改。”
