Having Criticized the Mistaken Idea that "Only Studying is Noble"
Many Middle and Primary School Graduates Resolve to Participate in Agricultural Production

This newspaper's April 8th editorial, "On the Question of Middle and Primary School Graduates Participating in Agricultural Production," has aroused the attention of Party and government organs and the broad masses of students in various regions. Party and government leading organs in many areas have specifically studied this issue and instructed relevant departments to earnestly and widely publicize the spirit of the editorial. The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has notified Party committees at all levels to organize cadres, teachers, and students throughout the province to conscientiously study this editorial. The Propaganda Department of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has also issued a notice, which, in addition to emphasizing the importance of studying this editorial, also requires Party committees at all levels, especially the propaganda departments of the Party committees, the government's cultural and educational departments, and organizations such as the Communist Youth League, student associations, trade unions, and women's federations, to divide responsibilities and provide guidance for this study. In this publicity work, many Party and government responsible cadres personally guided and reported to the broad masses of cadres and people.

This editorial has had a significant impact on the broad masses of middle and primary school graduates. Many graduates agree with the arguments put forward in the editorial. They said they would continue to seriously study this editorial and publicize it to people in society. The fifty-four graduating junior middle school students of Longchang Middle School in Sichuan Province expressed their active support for the arguments in the editorial in their enthusiastic and sincere letter. They believe that this editorial clearly points out the future of young students and expressed their intention to respond to the care of the Party and the people for the youth with their own practical actions.

In Tianjin, after studying the editorial, some high school and junior middle school graduates in some schools have raised their understanding and clarified confused thoughts. For example, when the students heard the loudspeaker broadcasting that "all other professions are base, only studying is noble" is the view of the feudal aristocracy and the bourgeoisie, they deeply felt that this wrong understanding should be corrected. Some students said, "Every sentence I hear touches my heart."

After studying the editorial, most of the graduating students of Taiyuan No. 5 Middle School, No. 6 Middle School, Yuci No. 1 Middle School, Yangquan No. 1 Middle School, and other schools have improved their understanding and realized that in our country, participating in any labor is the most glorious and heroic undertaking. Zhang Dong, a student of Yuci No. 1 Middle School, said: "In the past, I thought that only participating in industrial construction had a future. Through this study, I realized that industry and agriculture are like brothers and sisters, inseparable from each other, and agriculture is the base to ensure industrial raw materials, grain, and markets. Without agriculture, it would directly affect the development of industry. Therefore, I decided that if I fail the school entrance examination, I will happily return to the countryside to participate in agricultural production." The students are also fully ideologically prepared on how to deal with incorrect public opinion and pressure from their families and society. Their conclusion is: patiently persuade and educate, and more importantly, use their own practical actions to change the masses' incorrect views.

After studying, many students' parents and school teachers have also changed their past erroneous views and established correct viewpoints. Under their education and encouragement, many young people have realized the glory of labor and participate in labor production if they fail to enter school. Yuan Shouyi, Deputy Secretary-General of the Shashi Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in Hubei Province, after studying this editorial, criticized his own erroneous thinking of "all other professions are base, only studying is noble" and changed his attitude towards his children. He encouraged his two graduating children to become good laborers if they fail to enter school. Qi Jinshan, an art worker in Enshi County, recently wrote a letter to his son, Qi Yizhi, who is studying in the third grade of junior middle school at Xuanen No. 1 Middle School. The letter said: "Participating in agricultural production is the most glorious and promising position. If you fail to enter school, I hope you will dedicate your knowledge to the construction of mountainous areas like Teng Jiulin, a labor model in Hubei Province and a graduate of junior middle school in Hefeng County."

    批判了“唯有读书高”的错误认识
    很多中小学毕业生决心参加农业生产
    本报讯　4月8日本报发表了“关于中小学毕业生参加农业生产问题”的社论以后，已引起各地党、政机关和广大学生的重视。不少地区的党、政领导机关专门研究了这一问题，并指示有关部门认真地、广泛地宣传社论的精神。中共湖北省委通知各级党委组织全省的干部、教师和学生认真学习这篇社论。中共广东省委宣传部也发出通知，除强调指出学习这篇社论重要性外，并要求各级党委，特别是党委宣传部门，政府文教部门和青年团、学生会、工会、妇联等组织分工负责指导这一学习。在这次宣传工作中、不少党、政负责干部亲自指导，并向广大干部、群众作了报告。
    这篇社论在广大的中小学毕业生中发生了很大的影响，许多毕业生都赞同社论中所提出的论点，他们表示要继续认真地学习这篇社论，并向社会人士进行宣传。四川省隆昌中学应届初中毕业的五十四个学生在他们热情而真挚的来信中表示积极拥护社论中的论点，他们认为这篇社论明确地指出了青年学生的前途，表示要以自己的实际行动来回答党和人民对青年的关怀。
    天津市有些学校的高初中毕业生在学了社论以后，提高了认识，澄清了混乱思想。如当学生们听到扩音器播送社论时讲到“万般皆下品，唯有读书高”是封建贵族和资产阶级的观点时，都深深感到应该纠正这种错误认识。有的同学说：“我听一句，心动一下。”
    太原市第五中学、第六中学，榆次第一中学，阳泉第一中学等学校的应届毕业生经过学习社论，大多数学生提高了认识，认识到在我们的国家里，无论参加什么劳动，都是最光荣、豪迈的事业。榆次第一中学张栋同学说：“过去我认为只有参加工业建设才有前途，通过这次学习，使我认识到工农业是手足关系，谁也离不了谁，而农业又是保证工业原料、粮食和市场的基地。没有农业，就会直接影响工业的发展。因此，我决定考不上学校就愉快地回到农村参加农业生产。”同学们对于如何对待家庭、社会上不正确的舆论和压力，也有了充分的思想准备。他们的结论是：耐心地说服、教育，更重要的是用自己的实际行动来改变群众的错误观点。
    不少学生的家长、学校教师经过学习，也改变了过去的错误看法，树立了正确观点。在他们的教育和鼓舞下，使许多青少年认识到劳动的光荣，升不上学就参加劳动生产。湖北省沙市政协委员会副秘书长袁守义在学习这篇社论后，批判了自己的“万般皆下品，唯有读书高”的错误思想，改变了对待自己孩子的态度，他鼓励两个即将毕业的孩子，如果升不上学，就去作一个很好的劳动者。恩施县美术工作者齐金山最近写信给正在宣恩一中读初中三年级的儿子齐一之，信中说：“参加农业生产是最光荣最有前途的岗位。如果你升不上学，希望你像湖北省劳动模范、鹤峰县初中毕业生滕久林一样，把自己的知识献给山区建设事业。”
