    Zhejiang Lishui Cadres Learn Agricultural Technology
    Leading the Masses to Change Farming Systems
    According to the Zhejiang Daily: In Lishui County's large-scale change of farming systems and promotion of agricultural technology, county, district, and township leaders first learn the techniques, achieving "secretary goes to the fields, teaching cadres at all levels," with very good results.
    Before the early rice and early-mid rice in the plains of Lishui County entered the full stage of transplanting, leaders at all levels took the lead in learning transplanting techniques. On April 14, county party secretary Zhang Jieqing, deputy secretary Wang Jiafan, and county agricultural cooperation department director Guo Wencan, along with students from the county-run intensive transplanting training class, went to the fields to learn transplanting. After transplanting rice seedlings, Secretary Zhang told reporters: "If you understand the technology, you have the capital to lead production, and you can take the initiative in your work." Most township general branch secretaries in the county first learned transplanting techniques, then set an example, and then held transplanting training classes, conducted visits, and promoted intensive planting.
    Cadres learning the technology has played a good role in promoting changes in farming systems and promoting advanced technology. The county's double-cropping intercropping rice increased from a small amount of trial planting last year to more than 20,000 mu this year, and the conversion of mid-season rice to early rice also increased from more than 800 mu to nearly 10,000 mu. In the past, most cadres did not understand new technologies, and some did not even understand common technical knowledge. Therefore, the masses said: "Cadres can only talk but not do." Some people were worried that intercropping rice would be difficult to transplant and inconvenient to cultivate, and were unwilling to plant intercropping rice. After the county party committee discovered this problem, it believed that it was first necessary to help cadres learn the technology, so it held technical training classes, and district party secretaries and township general branch secretaries participated in the learning. In addition to studying in the training class, they also went to the fields to learn from old farmers and learn from technicians. Now, cadres can not only talk but also do. In the soaking of early rice seeds and the making of semi-dry seedbeds, most cadres took the lead in demonstrating, which effectively eliminated the farmers' concerns that they would not be able to grow double-cropping rice because they did not understand the technology, and at the same time, it promoted advanced technology more smoothly.

### 浙江丽水干部学习农业技术  带动群众改变耕作制度

    浙江丽水干部学习农业技术
    带动群众改变耕作制度
    据浙江日报消息：在丽水县大规模改变耕作制度和推广农业技术中，县、区、乡领导干部先学会技术，做到“书记下田，层层教会干部”，效果很好。
    当丽水县平原地区早稻和早中稻已进入全面插秧阶段以前，各级领导干部带头学习插秧技术。4月14日，县委书记张介清、副书记王家范和县委农业合作部部长郭文灿等领导干部和县直属乡密植插秧训练班的学员，一起下田学习插秧。张书记插秧后对记者说：“技术懂了，领导生产有了本钱，工作就主动了。”全县的大部分乡总支书记也都是先学会插秧技术后，做出样子，再举办插秧训练班，进行参观访问，推广密植的。
    干部学会技术对推动改变耕作制度、推广先进技术起了很好的作用。这个县双季间作稻由去年少量试种到今年推广二万多亩，中稻改早稻也由八百多亩增加到近一万亩。过去大部分干部不懂新技术，有的连普通技术常识也不懂。因此群众说：“干部只会讲不会做。”有些群众顾虑间作稻不好插秧，耕作不便，不愿种间作稻。县委发现这个问题后，认为首先必须帮助干部学会技术，于是就举办了技术训练班，区委书记、乡总支书记都参加学习，他们除了在训练班学习外，并下田向老农民学习，向技术人员学习。现在，干部不但会讲，而且会做了。在早稻浸种、做半旱秧田中，大部分干部都带头示范，因此也就有效地消除了农民怕不懂技术种不来双季稻的顾虑，同时也比较顺利地推广了先进技术。
