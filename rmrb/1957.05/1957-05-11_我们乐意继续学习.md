    We Are Happy to Continue Learning
    (Our report) On May 9th, six apprentices from the Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant told our reporter that they fully supported the State Council's notice on extending the apprenticeship period. The following is a summary of their statements.
    Xu Keyou
    The leaders announced to us the State Council's instructions on postponing promotions and explained to us the difficulties of the country and the plant: insufficient materials and few jobs. We have seen these with our own eyes. I also know the suffering of my older brother as an apprentice in the old society. Usually, we hear the master workers tell us about the suffering of a three-year apprenticeship, and we feel very happy for the apprentices now. Therefore, I have no objection to the State Council extending the apprenticeship period. In my work, I am not discouraged, but even more motivated.
    Wang Jiquan
    The State Council's regulations on postponing the time for apprentices to become full-fledged workers are correct. Taking my own actual situation as an example, although I have been learning for more than a year, I still cannot do the work without the help of the adjustment worker. It's okay to do the same work for a long time, but when I encounter new work, I can't do it. How can we take on the work of a third-grade technician in this situation? If we can't do the work and the state has to pay us more wages, this is not right. I am a member of the Youth League, and the League often educates us that when there is a conflict between personal interests and national interests, we should obey national interests. I guarantee to do this, and I guarantee to study hard and prepare for becoming a formal worker in the future.
    Zhao Fengxian
    When I entered the factory in March last year, I didn't understand what a third-grade technician did. Later, after studying for a period of time, I saw that a third-grade technician had to be able to do so many jobs, especially after knowing that our master had studied for several years to reach the level of a third-grade technician, I felt worried that I would not meet the national requirements after graduation. Now that the state has decided to extend our study time, I fully agree, so that we can have more time to learn more things. Of course, if we are not promoted, our treatment will not be improved, but our current treatment is not low. As long as we arrange our lives well, we can still live well, even better than some master workers with more family members.
    Yang Wenzheng
    This April was when we were supposed to become formal workers. At that time, some apprentices were not satisfied and complained, thinking that the leaders were not keeping their word. I also had opinions. Later, I listened to the leaders explain to us why we couldn't be transferred. Thinking about how my master has been working for several years and is only a second-grade worker, and I have to ask him every day when I work, otherwise I can't do it well. Thinking of these things, I feel a little ashamed to be promoted to a third-grade technician. Therefore, I fully agree to extend the learning time.
    Jiang Yuxue
    The country is currently in difficulty, and we should help the country overcome the difficulties. We apprentices contribute very little to the country. It is impossible to improve our personal lives first and then build the country. If the country is not well built, personal life cannot be guaranteed. Besides, after being promoted to a third-grade technician, the master will not help us as actively as before, and there will be more difficulties when doing new or more complicated work. I am only nineteen years old, and postponing the promotion to learn more skills and spend less money can enable me to develop a hard-working and simple lifestyle from an early age.
    Zhang Shulan
    I was very unhappy when I first heard the news that apprentices would not be promoted. Later, I thought about it carefully. We are a big country with 600 million people, and everyone hopes to improve their lives. But to improve our lives, we must have enough materials. Since we have not made much contribution to the country, asking to improve our lives, how can that work? Taking our factory as an example, because of insufficient raw materials, some workers have nothing to do and have been transferred to study. If we are still promoted, we will only increase the state's salary expenditure, and there will be no other benefits.

    我们乐意继续学习
    本报讯　5月9日，北京第一机床厂六位徒工对本报记者说，他们都十分拥护国务院关于延长学徒学习期限的通知。下面是他们讲话的摘要。
    许可有
    领导上给我们宣布国务院延缓升级的指示，又给我们讲明了国家的困难和厂里的困难：材料不足，活少；如果大家都升级的话，国家要白白花掉很多的钱。这些，都是我们亲眼看见的。我哥哥在旧社会里当徒工的痛苦，我也是知道的。平常，又听见老师傅给我们讲三年学徒的苦楚，很感到现在徒工的幸福。所以，对国务院延长徒工学习时间没意见。工作上，我不但没有泄气，反而更有劲了。
    王纪泉
    国务院对延缓徒工转正时间的规定，是正确的。拿我个人的实际情况来说，虽然学习一年多了，但做起活来仍然离不开调整工的帮助，长期做一样活还好些，一遇到换新活，就做不了啦。这样的情况要我们担任三级技工的工作，怎么能做得了呢，工作做不了，还要国家多给工资，这是不应该的。我是青年团员，团常常教育我们遇到个人利益同国家利益有矛盾的时候，就该服从国家利益，这我保证办到，并且保证努力学习，为将来转为正式工人做好准备。
    赵凤贤
    我去年3月进厂的时候，不懂得三级技工做些什么活，后来学了一个时期，看到一个三级技工要会做那么多的活，特别是知道我们的师傅学了好几年才达到三级技工水平，心里就发愁，耽心出师后达不到国家要求。现在国家确定延长我们的学习时间，我完全同意，这样可以使我们有更多的时间，学习更多的东西。当然，不升级待遇就不能提高，但是，我们现在的待遇也不算低了，只要把生活安排得好一些，还是过得去的，甚至比一些人口比较多的老师傅的生活还好。
    杨文正
    今年4月，就到我们该转为正式工人的时候了。当时没有转，有些徒工不大满意，发牢骚，认为领导上说话不算话，我也有意见。后来听了上级给我们讲清为什么不能转。再想到我的师傅干了几年了，也才只是二级工，每天做工我都得问他，不问就做不好。想到这些，就觉得升为三级技工有些惭愧了。所以，我完全赞成延长学习时间。
    姜玉雪
    目前国家有困难，我们应当帮助国家克服困难。我们当学徒对国家贡献很少，先提高个人生活，然后才建设国家，那是不可能的。国家建设不好，个人生活也是保不住的。再说，升为三级技工以后，师傅也不像从前那样主动帮助我们了，干新活，干比较复杂的活的时候，困难就更多了。我只十九岁，暂缓升级多学一些本事，钱花少一些，可以使我从小就养成艰苦朴素的生活作风。
    张淑兰
    我开始听到学徒工不升级的消息，挺不高兴。后来仔细想想，我们是个六万万人口的大国，每个人都希望改善生活。但是要改善生活就得有足够的物资，像我们对国家还没有多大贡献，就要求改善生活，那能成呢？拿我们厂里来说，因为原材料不足，有些工人没有事做，都调去学习了。如果我们还升级，只有增加国家工资开支，别的就没有什么好处了。
