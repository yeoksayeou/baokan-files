    Everyone's Sacred Responsibility

    The call for ending the nuclear arms race and stopping hydrogen bomb tests has resounded throughout the world. This has become the most widespread mass movement in the world today, and it is still continuing to develop.

    The nuclear arms race threatens the safety of the people of all countries, including the people of those countries that promote this policy. The people of all countries are unwilling to live under this terrible threat; they demand the elimination of this threat and the cessation of hydrogen bomb testing as the first step towards ending the nuclear arms race. This demand emanates from the conscience of every good person in the world, and because it concerns the life and safety of everyone, it possesses unparalleled power.

    Currently, only three countries in the world possess nuclear weapons: the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom. In this situation, it should not be very difficult to reach an agreement to prevent atomic war and end the nuclear arms race. Therefore, the people of all countries eagerly expect the governments of the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom to take action in this regard to satisfy people's desire for a peaceful and tranquil life.

    However, of the aforementioned three countries, only the Soviet government has consistently and sincerely supported the peaceful aspirations of the people of all countries. For many years, it has actively worked to reach a comprehensive disarmament agreement with Western countries, especially for the early realization of the prohibition of the use of atomic weapons. In order to open the way to resolving the disarmament issue, the Soviet government has repeatedly proposed a cessation of hydrogen bomb tests, and recently, at the United Nations Disarmament Commission Subcommittee, it further advocated separating this issue from the overall disarmament issue, and first reaching an agreement on a temporary cessation of tests within a specified period. These actions of the Soviet Union fully demonstrate its sincerity in striving to reach even a limited agreement on this issue as quickly as possible. However, the governments of the United States and the United Kingdom have not shown the slightest sincerity in this regard, and they have stubbornly rejected all the efforts of the Soviet Union. In this situation, the Soviet Union has taken new and active steps. On the 9th and 10th of this month, the Soviet government and the Supreme Soviet respectively submitted proposals and appeals to the Japanese government and the parliaments of the United States and the United Kingdom, requesting them to jointly urge the governments of the United States and the United Kingdom to conclude an agreement on the cessation of atomic and hydrogen bomb tests.

    These actions of the Soviet Union undoubtedly conform to the wishes of the people of all countries and are an encouragement to the movement of the people of all countries to end the nuclear arms race and stop hydrogen bomb tests.

    What about the attitude of the US and British governments? Regardless of how the people of all countries and the governments of many countries appeal, they are determined not to give up the use of nuclear weapons, and are not even willing to give up nuclear weapons testing. Not only that, but the US government is also making every effort to promote a policy of expanding atomic armaments in order to create tension around the world. At the recent meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council, it was decided to arm the armies of Western European countries with atomic weapons. This practice by the United States can only exacerbate the nuclear arms race, increase the military burden of the people of all countries, and especially cause endless disasters to the people of Western European countries.

    While the United States is promoting its policy of expanding atomic armaments in Western Europe, it is also deploying its missile forces to Taiwan, our territory, in order to further turn Taiwan into its dependency and atomic war base. This clearly shows that the reason why the United States insists on not ending the nuclear arms race, and instead is doing everything possible to expand atomic armaments, is entirely to use this weapon as a tool for its aggression. The provocative act of the United States stationing missile forces in Taiwan is the most blatant manifestation of this policy. However, this practice by the United States cannot intimidate anyone. The Chinese people's determination to liberate their territory of Taiwan is unshakable.

    The US policy of expanding atomic armaments is a dangerous policy that the people of all countries cannot tolerate. The reason why the United States dares to do this is also because the power of world public opinion has not been fully mobilized and has not formed an irresistible pressure on it. In order to eliminate the threat of nuclear war, for the peace and tranquility of every family, the people of all strata in all countries must take more extensive and more universal action to resolutely oppose the US pursuit of a nuclear arms race policy and force the United States to abandon this crazy policy that endangers humanity. This is the most urgent task for striving for peace at present, and it is also the sacred responsibility of every peace-loving person in the world!

    每一个人的神圣责任
    要求结束核武器竞赛和停止氢弹试验的呼声，已经响遍了全世界。这已成为当前世界上最广泛的一个群众性的运动，而目前这个运动还在继续开展中。
    核武器竞赛威胁着一切国家人民的安全，也包括那些推行这种政策的国家的人民的安全。各国人民不愿意生活在这种可怕的威胁之中；他们要求消除这种威胁，并且要求以停止氢弹试验作为走向结束核武器竞赛的第一步。这种要求发自世界上每一个善良人的良知，并且它关系着每一个人的生活与安全，因而它具有无比的力量。
    现在，世界上还只有苏、美、英三个国家拥有核武器。在这种情况下，就防止发生原子战争、结束核武器竞赛达成协议，应该并不是很困难的事。因此，各国人民殷切地期待苏、美、英三国政府在这方面有所行动，以满足人们对于和平、宁静的生活的渴望。
    但是，上述三个国家的政府，只有苏联政府一贯真诚热情地支持各国人民的和平愿望。它多年来一直积极地为同西方国家达成全面的裁军协议，特别是早日实现禁止使用原子武器而努力。为了打开解决裁军问题的道路，苏联政府曾多次建议停止氢弹试验，最近在联合国裁军委员会小组委员会上更主张把这个问题与总的裁军问题分开来，先达成在规定的期限内暂时停止试验的协议。苏联的这些作为，充分表现了它力求在这个问题上最快地达成那怕是有限的协议的诚意。可是，美英两国政府在这方面却没有表示最起码的诚意，它们顽固地拒绝了苏联的一切努力。在这种情况下，苏联又采取了新的、积极的步骤。苏联政府和最高苏维埃在本月9日和10日，分别向日本政府和美英两国议会提出了建议和呼吁书，要求它们一道来促使美英政府缔结关于停止原子弹和氢弹试验的协议。
    苏联的这些行动，无疑是符合于各国人民的愿望的，并且也是对各国人民要求结束核武器竞赛、停止氢弹试验的运动的一种鼓舞。
    反观美英两国政府的态度是怎样的呢？不管各国人民和许多国家的政府怎样呼吁，它们只是抱定一个决心：绝不放弃使用核武器，甚至也不肯放弃核武器的试验。不仅如此。美国政府还在竭力推行扩张原子军备的政策，来在世界各处制造紧张局势。在不久前举行的北大西洋集团理事会会议，决定要以原子武器武装西欧国家的军队。美国的这种做法，只能加剧核武器竞赛，加重各国人民的军费负担，特别是会使西欧各国人民受到无穷的灾害。
    美国在西欧推行其扩张原子军备政策的同时，还把它的导弹部队派驻到我国的领土台湾，以便把台湾进一步变成它的属地和原子战争基地。这就清楚地表明了，美国所以坚持不肯结束核武器竞赛，而且相反地在竭尽一切可能来扩张原子军备，其目的完全是为了要以这种武器作为它进行侵略的工具。美国在台湾驻扎导弹部队的挑衅行为，就是这种政策的最露骨的表现。但是，美国的这种做法是吓不倒人的。中国人民解放自己的领土台湾的决心是不可动摇的。
    美国的扩张原子军备的政策是一种危险的政策，这是各国人民所不能容忍的。美国之所以敢于这样做，也是由于世界舆论的力量还未充分动员起来，并对它形成不可抗拒的压力。为了解除核子战争的威胁，为了每一个家庭的和平和安静的生活，各国各阶层的人民还必须更为广泛、更为普遍地行动起来，坚决反对美国奉行核武器竞赛政策，逼迫美国放弃这一危害人类的疯狂政策。这是当前争取和平的最迫切的任务，也是世界上每一个爱好和平的人们的神圣责任！
