Xinhua News Agency, May 25th, Taipei dispatch: Foreign news agencies in Taipei report that the Chiang Kai-shek clique yesterday urgently dispatched three divisions of Chiang's troops into Taipei to suppress the anti-American patriotic demonstrations of the Taiwanese people. The Chiang Kai-shek clique's Taipei Garrison Command announced martial law at midnight yesterday, stipulating ten "capital offenses" to suppress the anti-American patriotic actions of the Taiwanese people. The American "Embassy" and the United States Information Service, which were smashed by demonstrating crowds on the 24th, as well as the US Taiwan Defense Command, the US Military Assistance Advisory Group in Taiwan, and other aggressive organizations and American residences, are now being "protected" by the Chiang Kai-shek clique's troops, military police, and police. Americans in Taiwan have been advised to stay home and not go out.

After the outbreak of the anti-American patriotic demonstrations by the people of Taipei, the Chiang Kai-shek clique immediately dispatched a large number of police and rushed troops to carry out bloody suppression and arrests. According to foreign news agencies, at least two demonstrators have been beaten to death. One of them was an overseas Chinese student who went to Taiwan from San Francisco. Many others were injured, including a 22-year-old overseas Chinese youth who was seriously injured. The Chiang Kai-shek clique has not announced the number of patriots arrested.

Yu Hung-Chun, the head of the Chiang Kai-shek clique's Executive Yuan, issued a statement, falsely accusing the masses participating in the anti-American patriotic demonstrations as "rioters" and declared that "the murderers who participated in the riots will be punished."
