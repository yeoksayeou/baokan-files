    Dear Comrade Liu Shaoqi!
    Dear comrades and friends!

    Please allow me, on behalf of the delegation of the People's Assembly of the People's Republic of Albania and the Albanian people, to extend the most heartfelt brotherly greetings to the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China, the citizens of Beijing, and the heroic Chinese people. At the same time, please allow me to express our gratitude to you for inviting us to visit your great and beautiful country.

    The delegation of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China, headed by Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, visited the People's Republic of Albania a few months ago. Our people remember with great admiration those days when the outstanding representatives of the fraternal Chinese people were in our country. Our people cherish the series of memories caused by that visit, just as they cherish the friendship with the Chinese people. We gladly accepted your invitation. Although we are separated by thousands of kilometers, it does not affect the close understanding of members within a family. The distant distance cannot become an obstacle to the closeness of our two peoples, because what connects us is a common path, common ideals, and what connects us is the lighthouse illuminating the activities of our two parties and two governments—Marxism-Leninism.

    The Albanian people, and we as their representatives, are proud to have such a great, loyal, and dear friend in the fraternal Chinese people. We highly value the friendship with your great people, especially the contributions made by the populous Chinese people to human development over thousands of years. We highly value the role played by the Chinese people today in the cause of human progress. The glorious traditions of the fraternal Chinese people are dear to our people who have fought for their liberation for a long time. We have much in common with you.

    The liberation of us Albanians and our entry onto the international stage are thanks to our common friend, the glorious Soviet Union, which leads the socialist camp. We are all united in the great socialist family with common goals and common ideals. There is no force in the world that can destroy this great unity.

    The Albanian people are sincerely happy for the great achievements of the Chinese people. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, your people are victoriously leading the country towards socialism. We regard every achievement of yours as our own achievement, because it strengthens our common power. We sincerely congratulate you on achieving greater success in the socialist construction of the country and liberating Taiwan Island, an inseparable part of Chinese territory. At the same time, we are indignant at the attempts of those who obstruct the People's Republic of China from obtaining its due position in the United Nations.

    Our people are filled with respect and deep gratitude for the generous assistance that the Chinese people have given, both in the past and present, in socialist construction. This assistance, as well as the assistance given by the Soviet Union and other friendly countries, enables us to move forward faster and overcome many difficulties.

    Please allow me to once again express the deep desire of our delegation that our visit to your great country will further promote the strengthening of our friendly relations for the happiness of our two countries and the socialist camp, and for peace and friendship between the peoples of all countries.

    Long live the great Chinese people!
    Long live the unbreakable friendship between the Albanian and Chinese people!
    Long live world peace!
