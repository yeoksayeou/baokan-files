    My Wet Nurse

    The Central People's Broadcasting Station's Radio Drama Troupe, the Beijing People's Art Theater, and the Central Academy of Drama are all rehearsing or analyzing Cao Yu's play "Beijing Man." Probably because I am a Beijinger, they all invited me to attend discussion meetings. At the meetings, we extensively discussed the characters in the play. I said at the time, "I don't know how Cao Yu experienced life, but even the character of Nurse Chen is so lifelike!" The Nurse Chen in the play really brought back my childhood memories from decades ago. I said to the comrade playing the role, "This role is not easy to play! You must portray Nurse Chen's love for Zeng Wenqing and the Zeng family as a sincere and unconditional love. She is a positive character!" I also talked about my own wet nurse and the nannies we hired in my family to help the actors better understand the character.
    Wet nurses and nannies are both considered domestic helpers, but there is a difference. The former breastfeeds the child, while the latter only takes care of the child. However, they both cherish the children they nurse or care for in the same way, starting from an employer-employee relationship, going through a process that is not short, and finally turning into a family relationship! I had a wet nurse before I was six years old. I only called her "Mom" at that time. Although I was very young, I still remember that her surname was Huang, and I also remember that her home was outside Dongzhimen in Hongqiao. She left a deep impression on me. When I was seven years old, my father died, and we couldn't afford to have a wet nurse anymore. Huang Mama left our house in tears and went to work as a nanny in a family with the surname Song. This Song family lived very close to my house, so she often came to see us. At the beginning of the month, after receiving her salary, she would buy some snacks and toys for me and my younger brother. My mother said, "Mama, don't spend your money." She always sighed and said, "Oh! Don't stop me. Children without a father are suffering!" As she said this, tears would fall. When Huang Mama came to my house, she always brought the Song family's little child with her. Therefore, we quickly became friends. More than forty years have passed, and now when I meet this "little" friend who performs Peking Opera in the troupe, we still talk about Huang Mama.
    In Cao Yu's play, it is written that everyone in the Zeng family calls Nurse Chen "Nurse Chen," which is suitable for official families who are Beijing officials and live in Beijing. But ordinary families in old Beijing did not address them this way. According to the characters in the play "Beijing Man," only Zeng Hao can call her Nurse Chen or Sister Chen. People of Zeng Wenqing's generation should call her Mom or Mom Chen. People like Zeng Ting and Rui Zhen should call her Grandma Chen. In the past, Beijing families were very affectionate towards their nannies, and nannies treated the families they served as their own. Sometimes they could even give the master some ideas and manage some housework. Therefore, it was not uncommon for a nanny to serve in a family for a lifetime. It was rare, or even unheard of, to change nannies every two months or for a nanny to quit after a month. Nurse Chen is an example of this for the Zeng family. Even after she retired and returned home to retire, she still brought her grandson to visit the child she nursed—and this child was even the father-in-law of a daughter-in-law—and brought beloved pigeons. This is such sincere love!
    In 1933, before my second child was born, my family hired a nanny who stayed in my house for seventeen years and returned to her hometown to have children after liberation. My children all called her "Dada" according to the Beijing way of addressing aunts. This Dada also truly loved my children. She often proudly said, "I watched three of their four children being born." My children also respected her very much, calling her husband Uncle, her sister Aunt, and her son Brother. People who didn't know us couldn't tell that we were two separate families. When she was in my house, if the children's mother hit the children, she would be the first to get anxious and always lead the children away in a hurry. Once, the children's mother was going to hit the children, and the children were so scared that they hid under the dining table. She felt that the children were too pitiful, so she pulled the children up and cried. My children were naughty when they were young and inevitably got into fights with the neighbor's children. The neighbors often used this sentence to warn their children, "Don't fight with the Jin family's children. It's easy to deal with their mother, but we can't afford to offend their old Zhang Mama!" Old Zhang Mama sincerely loved my children, especially my second child. Even after this child graduated from college, she still wanted to come to the city to see him and would still nag like she was taking care of a child: "The weather is unpredictable, it's better to wear more than less. If you wear more, you can always take it off! Put on that wool vest! It won't be that hot, but you can't stand it if you get cold!" "Don't wash your face with cold water! I'll get you warm water." She looked at the children and smiled, and the children also looked at her and smiled. When she came, the children always tried to get her to stay for a few more days. Her grandson called my children Uncle. If she couldn't come to the city for a long time, she would bother her grandson and say, "When you go to the city, be sure to see your little uncle." Are there still people like Old Zhang Mama? Yes, there are quite a few! I know of one.
    The wife of a comrade gave birth to a second child and did not have enough money to hire a nanny. While the couple was worrying, his wet nurse from when he was a child heard about it and rushed over to say, "Don't worry, I have nothing to do at home, I can help you for a while." This old Mama was very happy to see that the child she nursed had also given birth to two children. She didn't want to add to the burden of the child she nursed, so she quietly went home to find her son. She said to her son, "Don't I have to eat at home? Give me the grain I eat at home, and I'll go and help them for a while." In this way, she brought her own grain and worked as a volunteer nanny for two months until the new mother was healthy and the baby was easy to handle before leaving. This old Mama's actions deeply moved the nannies in the other families in that comrade's dormitory.

    我的奶妈
                  金受申
    中央人民广播电台广播话剧团、北京人民艺术剧院、中央戏剧学院，都在排演或分析研究曹禺同志的“北京人”剧本。大概因为我是北京人的缘故，所以就都邀我去开了座谈会。座谈会上，广泛地对剧本里的人物，都谈了一下，当时我说：“不知道曹禺同志怎么体验生活的，就是一个陈奶妈也塑造的那么像！”剧本里的陈奶妈，确实引起了我几十年前的童年回忆，我和扮演这个角色的同志说：“这个角色，可不好演啊！必须把陈奶妈爱曾文清、爱曾家，演成是真挚地、无条件地爱才行。她是正面人物！”我也谈了谈我的奶妈、我家请过的保姆的故事，帮助演员同志更理解这个人物。
    奶妈、看（念堪）妈虽然都算保姆，可是有区别的，前者是给孩子奶吃，后者是只管保育，但她们对于所奶的孩子，所看的孩子，都是同样的钟爱，都是从雇佣关系出发，经过一段不算短的过程，最后转到亲属关系的！我在六岁以前，是有奶妈的，我当时只叫她“妈妈”两个字，那时，我虽然年岁很小，可是我还记得她姓黄，还记得她家住在东直门外红桥，她给我的印象很深。我在七岁那年，父亲死了，没钱用奶妈了，黄妈妈也就在痛哭之下离开了我们家，到一个姓宋的人家做看妈去了。这个宋家离我家很近，所以她也就常来看我们，月头拿了工钱，还要给我和弟弟买一些点心、玩具来，母亲说：“妈妈就别花钱啦。”她总是叹息着说：“咳！您可别拦我了。没爹是苦孩子呀！”说着就流下眼泪来。黄妈妈来我家的时候，总是带着宋家那个小孩子，因此，我们很快就成了小朋友。四十多年了，现在遇见这位在剧团演京剧的“小”朋友，还彼此谈起黄妈妈来呢。
    曹禺同志的剧本里，写的是曾家所有的人都叫陈奶妈做“陈奶妈”，这是适合做京官、寄居北京的官宦家庭的。但老北京一般人家，不是这样称呼的，如按“北京人”这个剧本里人物来说，只有曾皓一个人可以叫她陈奶妈或陈姐，曾文清一辈的人，应该叫她妈妈或陈妈妈，像曾霆、瑞贞，还应该叫她陈奶奶呢。过去，北京人家对保姆是很亲热的，保姆对所服务的人家也像自己家里一样，有时还能替主人做一些主意，管一些家务。所以一个保姆在一个人家服务一辈子，不算什么稀奇的事。两个月一换保姆，一个月保姆不干了，以前是少见的，也可以说没有的。陈奶妈对于曾家就是一个例子，她都退休回家养老去了，还带着孙子给她奶过的孩子——并且这个孩子还是有了儿媳妇的公公——送来心爱的鸽子，这是何等真心的爱！
    1933年，在我的第二个小孩出生之前，我家请了一个保姆，她在我家整整十七个年头，解放后才回乡生产的。我的小孩子都按北京人称呼伯母的称法叫她“大大”，这位大大也真疼爱我这几个孩子，她常常自豪地说：“他们家四个孩子，我瞧着生了三个。”我的小孩子也很尊敬她，管她老伴儿叫大爷，管她姐姐叫大姨，管她儿子叫哥哥，不知道的，看不出是两家人来。她在我家的时候，如果孩子的妈妈打了孩子，她先急了，总是把孩子急忙引了走。有一次，孩子的妈妈要打孩子，吓得孩子藏到饭桌底下去了，她觉得孩子太可怜了，就拉着孩子哭起来。我的孩子，小时候是淘气的，是不免和邻居小孩子们打架的，邻居常常用这句话告诫自己的孩子：“别跟金家孩子打架，他妈倒好办，他们老张妈咱们惹不起！”老张妈是真心爱我的孩子，尤其爱我的第二个孩子，这个孩子大学都毕业了，她总还是要进城来看看他，总还是像照顾小孩似地絮叨：“天时不正，少穿不如多穿，多穿还能脱下来呀！穿上那毛背心！热也热不了多少，冷了可受不了！”“别凉水洗脸呀！我给你温水去。”她瞧着孩子们笑，孩子们也瞧着她笑。她来了，孩子们总想法留她多住些日子。她的孙子，管我的孩子叫叔叔，她如果好久不能进城的话，就磨烦她孙子，说：“你进城的时候，可千万瞧瞧你小叔叔去。”像老张妈这样的人，还有没有？有，有不少呢！我知道的，就有这么一个。
    有一位同志的爱人生了第二个小孩子，没有更多的钱请保姆，夫妇正在发愁的时候，他小时候的奶妈听说了，赶忙跑来说：“你们别着急，我闲着也没事，我帮你们些日子就行了。”这位老妈妈看着她奶大了的孩子也生了两个孩子，是非常高兴的。她不愿意让她奶大了的孩子增加负担，就悄悄地回家找她儿子去了，她对儿子说：“我在家不也得吃饭吗？你把我在家吃的粮食给我，我给人家帮些日子忙去。”就这样，自带粮食，做了两个月的义务保姆，直到产妇健康了，孩子利手了，才走。这位老妈妈这一行动，把那位同志宿舍里其他家的保姆，都深深地感动了。
