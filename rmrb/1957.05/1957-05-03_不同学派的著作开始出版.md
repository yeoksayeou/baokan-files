Xinhua News Agency Report: To thoroughly implement the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend, many publishing houses in Beijing have begun to publish works from various schools of thought.

The Sanlian Bookstore has already published collections of discussions on the periodization of Chinese slavery and feudalism and the question of the sprouts of Chinese capitalism, which present different viewpoints. It also plans to successively publish collections of discussions on issues such as the periodization of modern Chinese history, the formation of the Han nationality, and land ownership systems in Chinese dynasties. People's Publishing House and Sanlian Publishing House also plan to publish works such as Tang Yongtong's "Draft on Wei-Jin Metaphysics," Liu Jie's "Preserved Examination of Ancient History," and Shang Yanliu's "A Record of the Imperial Examination System in the Qing Dynasty."

The introduction of foreign academic works has also increased. In addition to publishing a large number of Marxist works on philosophy and political economy, Keynes' "The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money" has been translated into Chinese and published. Kant's "Critique of Pure Reason" is currently being typeset. Works by various schools of thought, such as Spinoza's "Ethics," are also planned for publication. The Commercial Press will also publish for the first time the first volume of French positivist jurist Léon Duguit's "Constitutional Law," anarchist Proudhon's "What is Property?", and reprint Austrian psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud's "Introductory Lectures on Psycho-Analysis."

The Science Press has already published "Homologous Polyploids and Double Diploids of Cereal Crops" by biologist Bao Wenkui, who holds different views from the Lysenko school in China, and Mendel's important work "Experiments in Plant Hybridization." It also plans to translate more than 40 scientific works from eight or nine countries, including the United States, Britain, Germany, France, and Italy.
