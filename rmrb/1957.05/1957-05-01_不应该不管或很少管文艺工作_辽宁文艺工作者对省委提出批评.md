Literary and Art Workers in Liaoning Criticize the Provincial Party Committee for Neglecting or Rarely Managing Literary and Art Work

(This headline above is the title for the article and does not need to be repeated below)

    This newspaper reports News: While it is important to manage steel, coal, and machinery, literary and art work should not be neglected or rarely managed either. This is a criticism of the Provincial Party Committee raised by many Party members and non-Party literary and art workers at a recent symposium on literary and art work convened by the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee. Many people stated in their speeches that the Provincial Party Committee has not sufficiently implemented the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," and that the Party's leadership over literary and art work is also weak. Some people said that since the establishment of the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee more than two years ago, it has rarely discussed the province's literary and art work. Therefore, they hope that the Provincial Party Committee can conduct at least one or two studies and discussions on literary and art work each year in the future. Party organizations know very little about the situation of literary and art work, and therefore lack overall planning for the problems existing in literary and art work. Someone reported at the meeting that although there are many drama troupes and opera troupes in the province, with Shenyang City alone having ten drama troupes, there are too many troupes but too few scripts, manpower is scattered, and they often compete with each other, causing everyone to complain. Trade unions, enterprises, and the military have occupied many well-equipped clubs and theaters, but the utilization rate is very low, while many professional art units suffer from a lack of suitable venues for performances and exhibitions. These all need to be properly arranged. Literary and art workers have no place to express their wishes and voices, and their practical difficulties are often not properly resolved for a long time. The folk song and dance troupe in Shenyang City tours factories and villages all year round, but their meals are a problem. The issue of dogmatism in literary and art work in Liaoning Province was also a topic of interest to many people at this symposium. The Liaoning People's Art Theater performed "The Flute is Played Horizontally," and a person in charge of the Writers Association published an article in the newspaper criticizing the script. However, some people in the theater wrote different opinions, but the local newspaper refused to publish them. People said that the dogmatism of those with power and influence is the most terrible, as it shackles people's minds and is the main obstacle to implementing "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend."
    The atmosphere of the entire symposium was very active, and people could express their opinions without any reservations. Huang Oudong, First Secretary of the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee, also spoke. He said that although the Provincial Party Committee had conveyed and discussed the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," it did not seriously mobilize the entire Party to discuss it, let alone take concrete measures based on this policy. Bureaucratism is a fatal flaw in the leadership of the Provincial Party Committee, which has been recognized for a long time, but it is even more serious in the leadership of literary and art work. Huang Oudong welcomed comrades in the literary and art circles to call or write to the Provincial Party Committee at any time in the future if they have any problems, so that they can be resolved at any time.
    The Liaoning Provincial Literary and Art Work Symposium began on April 23. More than 170 people from all aspects of the literary and art circles attended the symposium. Li Huang, Secretary of the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee, Wang Zimu, Deputy Governor, and responsible persons from relevant departments of the Party and government all attended the meeting.

### 不应该不管或很少管文艺工作  辽宁文艺工作者对省委提出批评

    不应该不管或很少管文艺工作
    辽宁文艺工作者对省委提出批评
    本报讯  要管钢铁、煤炭和机器，但也不应该不管或很少管文艺，这是最近辽宁地区党内外文艺工作者在省委召开的文艺工作者座谈会上很多人提出来的对省委的批评。不少人在发言中认为：省委对于“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针贯彻得很不够，党对于文艺工作的领导也很薄弱。有的人说，辽宁省委成立两年多来，对于全省的文艺工作一直很少讨论，因此希望省委今后每年对于文艺工作至少能进行一次或两次的研究和讨论。党的组织对于文艺工作的情况了解很少，因而文艺工作中存在的问题也缺乏统筹安排。有人在会上反映：全省话剧团、歌剧团数量虽然不少，仅沈阳市就有十个话剧团；但剧团多，剧本少，人力分散，常常唱对台戏，家家叫苦。工会、企业和部队占有了很多设备较好的俱乐部、剧场，但利用率很低，很多专业的艺术单位却苦于没有适当的演出、展览的场所。这些都需要适当地安排。文艺工作者的愿望和声音没有地方倾诉，他们的实际困难有的也长时期得不到适当地解决。沈阳市的民间歌舞团终年在工厂农村巡回演出，但他们的吃饭却成问题。对于辽宁地区文艺工作中的教条主义问题，也是这次座谈会上很多人发生兴趣的问题之一。辽宁人民艺术剧院演出了“洞箫横吹”，作家协会一个负责人在报纸上发表了批评这个剧本的文章，但这个剧院有人写了不同的意见，当地的报纸却拒绝刊载。人们说：有权有势的教条主义是最可怕的，它束缚人的思想，是贯彻“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的主要阻力。
    整个座谈会的思想很活跃，人们都能毫无顾虑地说出自己的意见。中共辽宁省委第一书记黄欧东也发了言。他说：对于“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，省委虽然也作了传达，也作了些讨论，但没有认真发动全党讨论，更没有根据这个方针采取具体措施。官僚主义是省委领导上的致命伤，这虽然在很久就意识到了，但在文艺工作的领导上表现得更为严重。黄欧东欢迎文艺界的同志们今后有什么问题，随时打电话或写信告诉省委，以便随时解决。
    辽宁省的文艺工作座谈会是在4月23日开始的，参加座谈会的有文艺界各方面人士一百七十余名，辽宁省委书记李荒、副省长王梓木，党和政府有关部门的负责人都出席了这个会议。
