    The Tragedy of American Farmers
    There was an American farmer who went bankrupt. He bought a batch of eggs for thirty cents a dozen, and then sold these eggs to wholesalers for twenty-five cents a dozen.
    His friend said to him, "You won't earn a penny doing this."
    "I know," he said with a mournful face, "but this is better than farming!"

    美国农民的悲剧
    美国有一位破了产的农民，他以每打美金三角的价格购进了一批鸡蛋，然后以每打美金二角五分的售价将这些鸡蛋出售给批发商。
    他的朋友对他说，“你这样做赚不到分文。”
    “我早就知道”，他哭丧着脸说，“但是这样做总比种地要强些！”
