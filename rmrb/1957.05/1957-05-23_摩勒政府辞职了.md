    The Mollet Government Resigns
    By a staff commentator

    The French Mollet government, which had been in power for about sixteen months, has finally resigned.

    Since the failure of the Anglo-French joint armed aggression against Egypt, the Mollet government has been in a precarious state. However, after Eden was forced to leave 10 Downing Street, Mollet lingered in the Matignon Palace for several months. He overcame political difficulties time and time again until he finally resigned this time, when left-wingers and right-wingers together voted against his thirty-fourth request to the parliament for a vote of confidence since taking office.

    What exactly did Mollet rely on to eke out this period of time? The reason is actually very simple. Mollet relied on the support of the right wing to barely maintain a majority in the French parliament. Why did the right-wing parties support the government of the socialist Mollet? The reason is also very simple. "Independent Party" member of parliament Legendre put it bluntly: "If we support the government, it is precisely because it does not keep its election promises."

    Mollet came to power as a socialist, relying on some beautiful promises. However, due to his anti-communist prejudices, he stubbornly refused to cooperate with the Communist Party, the largest party in parliament. This inevitably led him to rely on the support of the right wing. Therefore, after he came to power, he completely abandoned his promises and implemented policies that conformed to the wishes of the right wing. He made the colonial war in Algeria increasingly widespread. He launched an armed attack on Egypt for the benefit of the colonial groups. He actively organized the European Common Market, which was detrimental to the national interests of France but only beneficial to the monopoly groups. He followed the United States in advocating the atomic arms race, and refused to reach an agreement with the Soviet Union to guarantee international peace. He adopted economic policies that intensified the exploitation of the working people. He tried in every possible way to crack down on domestic democratic and progressive forces.

    The reactionary policies pursued by Mollet naturally could not extricate France from its predicament. The military adventure against Egypt brought heavy disasters to France. The "dirty war" in Algeria became increasingly hopeless. The heavy military expenditure was increasingly becoming an unbearable burden for France. As a result, the Mollet government became increasingly unpopular. Even within the Radical Socialist Party and Mollet's own Socialist Party, which participated in the Mollet government, discontent greatly increased. The recent congress of the Radical Socialist Party passed a resolution demanding that the Mollet government immediately change its current policies. At the congress of the Socialist Party, the number of people who opposed the government's policy on Algeria also greatly increased compared to the past.

    Under these circumstances, although Mollet tried his best to please the "two hundred families," and even recently expressed his firm refusal to budge on the Suez Canal issue, the right wing felt that the time had come to kick Mollet aside. The right-wing parties originally wanted nothing more than to use Mollet's Socialist Party to alleviate their political crisis and were not satisfied with Mollet's certain reform measures aimed at strengthening the Socialist Party's influence among the workers. Recently, Mollet, under pressure from financial and economic difficulties, proposed austerity measures and tax increases in order to plan for the military expenditure in Algeria. The "Independent Party" members of parliament voted against it, which destroyed the majority that Mollet had barely pieced together in parliament. The Mollet government had no choice but to resign.

    The resignation of the Mollet government once again illustrates the bankruptcy of France's current policies. If the "dirty war" in Algeria continues, if there is no fundamental change in France's foreign and economic policies, no matter who is brought in to form a government, the same fate cannot be avoided.

    摩勒政府辞职了
    本报评论员
    执政约十六个月的法国摩勒政府终于辞职了。
    自从英法合伙对埃及发动的武装侵略失败以后，摩勒政府就一直处在朝不保夕的状态中。但是在艾登被迫离开唐宁街十号之后，摩勒还在马提翁大厦耽了几个月。他一次又一次地度过政治难关，直到这次上任以来第三十四次要求议会投信任票时，左派人士和右派分子一起投了反对票，才最后辞职。
    摩勒究竟是凭了什么又苟延了这么一段时间呢？原因其实很简单。摩勒是靠着右派的支持，才在法国议会中勉强维持了多数地位。为什么右翼政党要支持社会党人摩勒的政府呢？原因也很简单。“独立党”议员勒让德尔说得一针见血：“如果说我们支持政府，那正是由于它不信守它的选举诺言。”
    摩勒是以社会党人的身份，靠了一些漂亮的诺言上台的。但是，由于他的反共成见，他顽固地拒绝同议会中最大的政党共产党合作。这就使他必然要依靠右派的支持。因此，在他上台以后，他就完全丢开自己的诺言，而执行符合右派愿望的政策。他使对阿尔及利亚的殖民战争越来越扩大了。他为了殖民集团的利益而对埃及发动武装进攻。他积极筹组有损法国民族利益而只对垄断集团有好处的欧洲共同市场。他追随美国鼓吹原子军备竞赛，而拒绝同苏联达成保障国际和平的协议。他采取了加紧榨取劳动人民的经济政策。他多方打击国内的民主进步力量。
    摩勒所执行的这种反动政策，当然不能使法国摆脱困境。对埃及的军事冒险给法国带来了沉重的灾难。在阿尔及利亚的“肮脏战争”越打越没有希望。沉重的军费开支日益成为法国无力承受的负担。因此，摩勒政府就越来越不得人心。甚至在参加摩勒政府的激进社会党里和摩勒自己的社会党里，不满情绪也大为增长。最近激进社会党的代表大会就通过决议，要求摩勒政府立即改变现行政策。在社会党的代表大会上，反对政府对阿尔及利亚政策的人也比过去大大增加了。
    在这种情况下，虽然摩勒竭力向“二百家族”讨好，甚至最近在苏伊士运河问题上还表示坚决不让步；但是右派感到把摩勒踢开的时候已经到了。右翼政党本来无非是要利用摩勒的社会党来缓和它们政治上的危机，对于摩勒某些目的在于加强社会党在工人中间的影响的改良措施并不满意。最近摩勒迫于财政经济的窘困，为了筹划阿尔及利亚的军费而提出了节约措施和增税计划。右派的“独立党”议员投了反对票，这就破坏了摩勒在议会中勉强拼凑住的多数。摩勒政府不得不辞职。
    摩勒政府的辞职，又一次说明法国现行政策的破产。如果阿尔及利亚的“肮脏战争”继续打下去，如果法国的外交政策和经济政策没有根本的改变，无论是捧出谁来组织政府，都不能避免同样的下场。
