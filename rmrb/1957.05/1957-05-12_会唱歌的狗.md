    A Singing Dog
    Tokyo recently discovered a two-year-old "genius dog singer" capable of singing several bars of "St. Louis Blues."
    The "singer" is named Jack. His owner, Yasuo Numata, who lives in a bustling area of Tokyo, is the one who discovered the dog's singing talent.
    Numata enjoys playing the wooden flute. He noticed several times that when he played the flute, Jack would make "melodic" howls along with the flute music. Therefore, starting in October last year, he began teaching it to sing.
    According to him, although Jack's performing "singing program" is currently limited, he is now only learning the tunes of "St. Louis Blues" and a few popular songs, but he has talent in this area.
    Numata said that his and Jack's common goal is to prepare for a singing competition with another dog in London. According to recent news, the dog in London can sing the Christmas song "Jingle Bells" and swing dance tunes, and is also planning to have its singing recorded. (Xinhua News Agency)

    会唱歌的狗
    东京最近发现了一个两岁的“天才的狗歌唱家”，它能够唱“圣路易布鲁斯”一曲的好几小节的调子。
    这位“歌唱家”的名字叫杰克，主人是东京闹区的沼田安雄，也就是他发现这只狗具有歌唱才能的。
    沼田嗜好吹木箫，有好几次他发现当他吹起木箫的时候，杰克就随着箫声发出“有旋律”的长吼，因此从去年10月开始，教它唱歌。
    据他说，虽然杰克表演的“歌唱节目”目前有限，它现在只在学“圣路易布鲁斯”和少数几首流行歌曲的调子，但是它在这方面是有天才的。
    沼田说，他同杰克共同的目的是准备同在伦敦的另一只狗进行歌唱比赛。据最近消息说，伦敦那只狗能唱圣诞歌“叮咚的铃响”和摇摆舞的调子，并且还要把它的歌声灌成唱片。（新华社）
