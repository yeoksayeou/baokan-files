    Non-Party Members Should Not Be Forced to Participate in Rectification
    To the Editor:
    The Party Central Committee's instructions on the Rectification Movement stipulate: "Non-Party members are welcome to participate in the Rectification Movement if they are willing. However, it must be entirely voluntary and not forced." In our organization—the Sales Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry—non-Party members make up more than half of the staff. After reading the Central Committee's instructions, they were all very happy and actively participated in the study of relevant rectification documents. After studying, their enthusiasm increased, and they expressed their desire to participate in the Rectification Movement. However, a few non-Party comrades are unwilling to participate in the rectification, with great concerns, fearing retaliation after criticizing the leadership. Our party organization here plans to let everyone study the documents well and dispel their concerns. We will resolutely adopt the principle of complete voluntarism for non-Party comrades, allowing them to participate in the rectification through self-enrollment.
    It is worth noting that some Party members in our organization have adopted a disguised coercive attitude towards the participation of non-Party comrades in the rectification. For example, at a study meeting attended by non-Party comrades, a Party member said: "All progressive masses will participate in the rectification." This remark caused dissatisfaction among many non-Party comrades. Some comrades openly said: "If you say that, who wants to be a backward element? No one would be unwilling to participate!" I think this is a disguised form of coercion towards non-Party comrades.
    I believe that the participation of non-Party members in the rectification must be completely voluntary. Any disguised coercion or sarcasm violates the spirit of the Central Committee's instructions and will only exacerbate the contradictions between the Party and non-Party members.
    Our party organization here has taken measures to correct this phenomenon.　Zhu Shichuan

### 不能强迫非党同志参加整风

    不能强迫非党同志参加整风编辑同志：
    党中央关于整风运动的指示中规定：“非党员愿意参加整风运动，应该欢迎。但是必须完全出于自愿，不得强迫。”我们机关里——第一机械工业部销售局的非党员比党员多一半，他们看了中央指示后，都很高兴，并且积极参加了有关整风的文件学习。经过学习，他们的热情更高了，纷纷表示要参加整风运动。但是也有少数非党同志不愿参加整风，顾虑很大，怕整了领导后遭到报复。我们这里的党组织准备让大家学好文件，解除顾虑以后，对非党同志坚决采取完全自愿原则，让他们用自动报名的方式参加整风。
    值得注意的是，我们机关有些党员对非党同志参加整风问题，采取了变相的强迫态度。比如在一次有非党同志参加的学习会议上，有一个党员说：“凡是要求进步的群众都会参加整风。”他这一说，引起了许多非党同志的不满意。有的同志公开说：“这样说，还有谁愿意当落后分子？没有不愿参加的！”我觉得，这是一种对非党同志变相强迫的表现。
    我认为非党员参加整风，一定要完全自愿，任何变相的强迫和讽刺，都违背了中央的指示精神，只会促使加深党与非党之间的矛盾。
    对于这种现象，我们这里的党组织已采取措施纠正。　朱石船
