Goodbye, Dear Comrade Voroshilov!

Comrade Chairman Voroshilov and other distinguished Soviet guests have returned to Beijing the day before yesterday after visiting the Republic of Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Today, the distinguished guests will leave Beijing and head home. There is an old Chinese poem that says, "It's hard to meet, and even harder to part"! Comrade Voroshilov traveled a long way to visit our country and spent a wonderful spring with our people. It was a rare gathering. Today, as we are about to separate from our closest friends, everyone feels reluctant and endlessly nostalgic.

Comrade Voroshilov visited our country for more than three weeks, and the Chinese people spent this spring festival, this festival of friendship, with joy and happiness. In these unforgettable days, by the Zhongnanhai Lake, beside Yuexiu Mountain, on the bridgehead of the Yangtze River Bridge, in the workshops of Anshan Iron and Steel, in the Shanghai Children's Palace, in the tea gardens of Hangzhou..., the footprints of the distinguished guests were left everywhere, and the friendship of the brothers was left everywhere. We will never forget Comrade Voroshilov's warm embrace with Chairman Mao, which is a symbol of the unbreakable unity of the eight hundred million people. We will never forget Comrade Voroshilov's humorous conversations and earnest speeches, and we will never forget Comrade Voroshilov's concern and love for the people of our country, which gave us youthful vitality and great encouragement. Comrade Voroshilov's friendly visit will forever remain in the beautiful memories of our people and will be written into the epic of Sino-Soviet friendship to be passed on forever.

We also remember the enthusiastic words Comrade Voroshilov spoke when he first set foot on our country's soil: "We old Communists, long before the great October Socialist Revolution in Russia, watched with fervent sympathy the Chinese people's struggle against the oppression of imperialism and feudalism, and for national independence and social freedom." Yes, as an older generation of Communists, Comrade Voroshilov personally witnessed the entire process of the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle under the leadership of the Communist Party until they achieved a great victory. Throughout the Chinese people's struggle for national liberation, how much concern and sympathy have the older generation of Communists like Comrade Voroshilov and the entire Soviet people given to the Chinese revolution! How much assistance and support has our great ally, the Soviet Union, given us! Today, Comrade Voroshilov has personally come to this victorious country, personally seen the liberated people, seen Marxism-Leninism blossom all over the fertile soil of China, and seen the great and selfless assistance of the Soviet Union bear fruit in this country. How can this situation not make our Soviet guests—our dearest brothers—as excited and joyous as our people!

At the same time, we also saw the growth process of the world's first socialist country from Comrade Voroshilov, the representative of the great Soviet people. His snow-white temples are clearly the traces of the glorious struggle of the Soviet Communists, and his vigorous spirit represents the happy present and future of the Soviet people. Today, the Soviet working people are bravely advancing towards communism. The Soviet industry is catching up with the world's major capitalist countries, agriculture is booming, and the amazing achievements of Soviet science have brought great happiness to the people. The Soviet defense forces, equipped with the world's most modern weapons, have made the imperialists tremble. The Soviet Union's peaceful policy of nurturing the people like a spring breeze is broadly uniting all peace-loving countries and people in the world. The Soviet Union's today and tomorrow are an inexhaustible source of strength for our people to strive for the cause of socialism.

Comrade Voroshilov once said during his visit to Anshan Iron and Steel that the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people is "a friendship forged in the raging fire of the steelmaking furnace." Yes, our friendship is a friendship tested by time, a friendship that has been tempered into steel. Comrade Voroshilov's visit has added new glory to this friendship. The friendship of the eight hundred million people of the great China and the Soviet Union is eternal and unbreakable. The imperialists deeply hate our friendship and unity. However, as Comrade Voroshilov said, those who want to find cracks in the relations between China and the Soviet Union are just "wasting their efforts"!

After visiting our country, Comrade Voroshilov also visited the Republic of Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and on his way home, he will also visit the Mongolian People's Republic. This old warrior who has fought for world peace all his life was welcomed with great enthusiasm by the people in Indonesia. The reason why the Indonesian people welcomed Comrade Voroshilov so warmly is, as President Sukarno said, "Because in our struggle for independence, the Soviet Union has always stood by us and supported us." During his visit, Comrade Voroshilov expressed the deep friendship of the Soviet people for the Indonesian people. He said: I believe that the just cause of the Indonesian people will eventually be victorious, and the day will come when the glorious Indonesian flag will fly in West Irian. The press communiqué of Chairman Voroshilov's visit to Indonesia and President Sukarno's talks is a new symbol of the development of friendship between the Soviet Union and Indonesia. In the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Comrade Voroshilov was also warmly welcomed by the Vietnamese people. According to Vietnamese custom, the Vietnamese people respectfully call Comrade Voroshilov "Uncle Vo," and they sincerely thank the Soviet Union for its generous assistance to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Comrade Voroshilov also repeatedly stated that the Soviet people support the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Vietnamese people's struggle for national reunification. Comrade Voroshilov's warm embrace with President Ho Chi Minh is a sign that the friendship between the Soviet and Vietnamese people is becoming even closer. Comrade Voroshilov's visit not only strengthened the unity of socialist countries, but also made a significant contribution to peace in Asia and the world.

Our dear Comrade Voroshilov and other distinguished Soviet guests are leaving us today to return home. The Chinese people value feelings and cherish parting. However, the people of China and the Soviet Union are united by the common ideology of Marxism-Leninism, and our friendship and unity, built on the basis of the common cause of socialism and communism, cannot be separated by any force.

Dear Comrade Voroshilov, as you leave our country, the people of our country deeply cherish the feeling of reluctance and bid you farewell. We wish you a safe journey! We wish you good health and longevity! We wish all the Soviet people new victories in the construction of communism! We wish the fraternal friendship of the eight hundred million people of China and the Soviet Union will always bloom like spring flowers and flourish like summer trees!

### 再见吧，亲爱的伏老！

    再见吧，亲爱的伏老！
    伏罗希洛夫主席和苏联其他贵宾们，在访问了印度尼西亚共和国和越南民主共和国以后，已经在前天回到北京。今天，贵宾们就要离开北京首途回国了。中国有句古诗说：“相见时难别亦难”！伏老不远万里而来访问我国，和我国人民共度了一段美好的春天，这是一次难得的聚会。今天，当我们要和我们最亲密的朋友分离的时候，我们每个人的心中都感到别情依依，无限留恋。
    伏老在我国访问了三个多星期，中国人民都怀着愉快和幸福的心情，来欢度这个春天的节日，友谊的节日。在这些难忘的日子里，在中南海畔，在越秀山旁，在长江大桥桥头上，在鞍钢车间里，在上海的少年宫，在杭州的茶园里……，到处都留下了贵宾们的足迹，到处都留下兄弟们的友谊。我们永远难忘伏老和毛主席的亲热拥抱，这是八亿人民坚如磐石般团结的象征。我们永远难忘伏老的逸趣横生的谈笑和语重心长的演说，永远难忘伏老对我国人民的关怀和热爱，这些给了我们以青春的活力和莫大的鼓舞。伏老这次的友好访问，将永远留在我国人民的美好记忆里，将被写入中苏友谊的史诗中永远留传。
    我们还记得，伏老刚刚踏上我国国土的时候说的热情的话：“我们老一辈的共产党人，远在俄国伟大的十月社会主义革命以前，就已怀着热烈的同情，注视着中国人民为反对帝国主义和封建主义的压迫，为争取民族独立和社会自由而进行的斗争。”是的，作为一个老一辈的共产党人，伏罗希洛夫同志是亲眼看到中国人民在共产党领导下进行革命斗争直到取得伟大胜利的整个过程的。在中国人民争取民族解放斗争的整个过程中，像伏老这一辈的老共产党人和全体苏联人民，曾经对中国的革命赋与多少的关怀和同情啊！我们伟大的盟邦苏联给予我们多少的援助和支持啊！今天，伏老亲身来到了这个胜利了的国家，亲眼看到了解放了的人民，看到马克思列宁主义在中国的沃土上开遍鲜花，看到苏联伟大无私的援助在这个国家里结满果实。此情此景，怎能不使我们的苏联贵宾们——我们最亲爱的兄弟同我国人民一样地兴奋和欢欣呢！
    同时，我们从伟大苏联人民的代表伏老身上，也看到了世界上第一个社会主义国家成长的过程。他那雪白的鬓发，分明是苏联共产党人光辉战斗的痕迹，他那矍铄的精神，代表着苏联人民幸福的今天和明天。今天，苏联劳动人民正在勇往直前地奔向共产主义。苏联的工业正在直追世界最主要的资本主义国家，农业正在蓬勃地发展，苏联科学的惊人成就已为人民带来极大的幸福。以世界上最新式武器装备起来的苏联国防力量，已使帝国主义心惊胆寒。苏联的春风化雨的和平政策，正在广泛地团结着世界上一切爱好和平的国家和人民。苏联的今天和明天，是鼓舞我国人民为社会主义事业奋斗的无穷力量。
    伏老在鞍钢参观的时候曾经说过，中苏两国人民的友谊是“炼钢炉的烈火炼出来的友谊”。是的，我们的友谊是经过时间考验的友谊，是百炼成钢的友谊。伏老这次的访问更给这种友谊增添了新的光辉。伟大的中苏两国八亿人民的友谊，是永恒的、牢不可破的。帝国主义者对我们的友谊和团结是深恶痛绝的。可是，正如伏老所说的，那些想在中苏两国关系中寻找裂痕的人只是“枉费心机”！
    伏老在访问了我国以后，又访问了印度尼西亚共和国和越南民主共和国，在回国的途中，还要访问蒙古人民共和国。这位为世界和平奋斗一生的老战士，在印度尼西亚受到了人民的万分热情的欢迎。印度尼西亚人民所以这样热情地欢迎伏老，这正如苏加诺总统所说的：“因为我们在争取独立的斗争中，苏联一直站在我们一边，支持我们。”伏老在访问中表达了苏联人民对印度尼西亚人民的深厚友谊。他说：相信印度尼西亚人民的正义事业终将得到胜利，印度尼西亚光荣的国旗在西伊里安飘扬的日子将要到来。伏罗希洛夫主席访问印度尼西亚和苏加诺总统会谈的新闻公报，是苏联和印度尼西亚两国友谊发展的新的标志。在越南民主共和国，伏老也受到了越南人民同样热烈的欢迎。越南人民按照越南的习惯，把伏老尊称为“伏伯伯”，他们衷心地感谢苏联对越南民主共和国的慷慨的援助。伏老也一再表示苏联人民支持越南民主共和国和越南人民争取祖国统一的斗争。伏老和胡志明主席的热情拥抱，是苏越两国人民友谊愈加亲密的标志。伏老这次的访问，不仅加强了社会主义国家的团结，而且对亚洲和全世界的和平作出了重大的贡献。
    我们亲爱的伏老和苏联的其他贵宾们今天就离开我们回国了。中国人民是重感情、惜别离的。但是，中苏两国人民有共同的马克思列宁主义的思想把我们团结在一起，有共同的社会主义和共产主义的事业把我们联系在一起，在这个基础上建立起来的友谊和团结，是任何力量也不能分离的。
    亲爱的伏老，在您离开我国的时候，我全国人民都深怀依依惜别的心情给你送别。我们祝您一路平安！祝您健康长寿！祝全体苏联人民在共产主义建设中取得新的胜利！祝中苏八亿人民的兄弟友谊永远像春天的花朵一样盛开，像夏天的树木一样繁茂！
