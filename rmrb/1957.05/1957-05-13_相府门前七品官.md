    "A Seventh-Rank Official Before the Prime Minister's Gate"
            Wu Zuguang

    In any job we hold today, in order to do our work faster and better, it is necessary for us to look for some "tricks" at any time and any place. Based on my social experiences over the years, it's impossible to get by in our lives without looking for "tricks."

    Let's start with "making phone calls."

    As a member of society, one is bound to have some friends, some brothers, sisters, or other relatives; with these relationships, there will inevitably be some interactions, and therefore, one will inevitably have to make phone calls. But making a phone call today is not simple. The invention and use of the telephone were originally meant to be quick and convenient, but today many people who answer the phone use difficulty and unnecessary complications to use this tool of communication and thought.

    Everyone has the experience of calling government offices or their residential quarters. The leisurely attitude of the person answering the phone is simply unimaginable. They ask you where you are calling from, what your name is, who you are looking for, and what's the matter... they almost want to ask about three generations of your family, and whether they will connect you seems to depend on their mood.

    Naturally, if you are calling for official business, it is easier to speak if you bring up the name of the organization. But who doesn't have some personal matters? Who can always talk about work and tasks? So, when calling for non-official matters, encountering such questioning always feels a bit unreasonable; if you feel unreasonable, you lack confidence, and the difficulties you encounter become greater. It's common to get angry when trying to make a phone call.

    As the saying goes, "Can you drown from being submerged?" There are still tricks to making phone calls, and this trick is called the "Using the Big to Suppress the Small Method." It's simple: if you call a section, say you're from the office; if you call the office, say you're from the bureau; if you call the bureau, say you're from the ministry; if you call the ministry, say you're from the academy... and so on, growing with the wind. The call will be connected immediately, and it never fails.

    Originally, a phone call is just a phone call, with sound but no form. Falsely reporting your affiliation a bit to save time, what's wrong with that? The beauty is that after saying this, the other party generally won't ask anything more. The reason is: the person answering the phone is afraid of their superiors. Grasp this key, and you can get through.

   "Those who flatter superiors are bound to bully subordinates." This is why you can't get through on the phone.

    Regarding phone calls, there is another situation. Last year, when I went to Kunming, I wanted to call my younger sister who works in the Yunnan Provincial Party Committee. But I couldn't find the phone number. The phone book didn't have the phone number of the Communist Party Provincial Committee. Asking the service personnel at my lodging, I learned that the Provincial Party Committee's phone was a "secret phone." Naturally, I found it later, but I really don't understand why a phone needs to be "secret"? Especially since the Communist Party is the party of all the people, a party that shares the breath of all the people, why is even this phone that connects with the people kept "secret"? Maybe the phones of certain departments or certain leaders need to be "secret" for a while, but why isn't there even one phone that can be public? If the people are not even allowed to call in, how can we talk about connecting with the masses? On the contrary, it really has the taste of "rejecting people thousands of miles away." Later, someone told me that this might also be a kind of "system," the same throughout the country, not just Yunnan Province. I checked the Beijing phone book, and sure enough, I couldn't find the phone numbers of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee or the various district party committees. The phone number of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China is even more out of the question.

    From here, I thought of another matter. Also last year when I went to Kunming, I went to Yunnan University several times for work needs. I met old classmates who I had been separated from for over twenty years and who are now professors at Yunnan University. Everyone was naturally very happy. One professor asked me to visit her home before I left Kunming no matter what. Sitting with childhood friends is a joy that "rarely happens again in life." On the morning of the day before I left, I woke up very early and walked along Cuihu Lake to Yunnan University. Who knew that I was stopped by the gatekeeper at the entrance. I explained my intentions, and the answer I received was three words: "No visitors." The expression on the gatekeeper's face was as cold as ice, with no room for negotiation. Visiting friends was originally a happy thing, and it wasn't worth arguing and getting angry over, so I had to retreat silently.

    Naturally, this matter gave me another thing I didn't understand. Even prisons allow visitors to see prisoners, what kind of system is this "no visitors"? Okay, let's just call it the "closed-door policy." What's even more incomprehensible is that I had been to Yunnan University several times, and the gatekeeper standing at the entrance was the same person who had enthusiastically given me directions. But why did his face suddenly change this time? While walking back to Cuihu Lake with my head down in melancholy, I suddenly understood: the previous few times I had gone by car, and this last time I had gone on foot. That's where the problem lies: the gatekeeper "recognizes cars but not people." He knows that those who come by car are either leaders or VIPs; then those who walk are either the people or the masses. Receiving such treatment in the "highest institution of learning" is truly filled with endless emotions.

    In fact, this is not just the case at Yunnan University. In the places I have been to over the years, in eight or nine out of ten cases, a car also serves as a pass. This is not like making phone calls where it's easy to find a trick. Phone calls only have sound, while cars are not simple.

    The aforementioned appearances and images of some people answering phones and some gatekeepers in government offices naturally reminded me of Yan Xia in the Peking opera "Beating Yan Song." This "seventh-rank official before the prime minister's gate, it's easy to see him, hard to see me" is a typical figure in the old society who sought power by currying favor with those in power and bullying those below. However, his spirit has not dissipated for thousands of years and is still deeply rooted and flourishing even today after liberation.

    What is serious is that this kind of spirit, this kind of consciousness, is precisely something that the leaders cannot come into contact with and experience.

    “相府门前七品官”
            吴祖光
    在今天我们任何一种工作岗位上，为了使工作做得更快更好，我们有必要随时随地去找一些“窍门”。根据这些年的社会经历，在我们的生活里，不找“窍门”也不行。
    先说说“打电话”吧。
    做一个社会上的人，谁也不免得有些朋友，有些兄、弟、姊、妹或是其他的亲戚之类；有了这些关系，也必然得有一些交往，于是也就不免要打打电话。可是今天打个电话也不简单。电话的发明和使用原该是图个快速方便，然而今天许多接电话的人都是用刁难和不必要的繁琐来使用这种交通语言、思想的利器的。
    谁都有往机关或机关宿舍里打电话的经验，接电话的对方的好整以暇的态度简直是你难以想像的。问你是哪里？叫什么名字？找谁？有什么事？……几乎把祖孙三代都要问到，最后给传不传好像还得看他高兴。
    自然，假如你是为了公事打电话，抬出机关的招牌就好说话些。可是谁不有点私事呢？谁能永远谈工作，谈任务呢？所以为了无关公事而打电话的时候，碰到这样的盘问，就总觉得有点理屈；理屈则气不壮，于是碰到的刁难就越大。为打个电话而生一肚子的气是常事。
    常言说得好：“溺还能把人憋死？”打电话还是有窍门的，这个窍门叫做“以大压小法”。说来简单，电话打到科里你就说是所里；打到所里，说是局里；打到局里，说是部里；打到部里，说是院里……以此类推，见风便长；话到即传，万试不爽。
    本来么，电话，电话，有声无形；虚报一下字号，免得浪费时间，有什么不好。妙在是这样说了之后，一般的是对方决不再多问什么了。原因是：接电话的人怕上级。抓住这个关键，就能打通电话。
   “媚上者必然欺下”，这就是为什么打不通电话的原因。
    关于电话，还有另外一种情况，去年我到昆明，想打个电话给在云南省委机关工作的妹妹；但是找不到电话号码，电话簿里没有中国共产党省委的电话。打听住处的服务人员才知道省委的电话是“保密电话”。自然后来还是找着了的，但是我实在不明白电话有什么“保密”之必要？尤其共产党是全国人民的党，是和全国人民共呼吸的党，为什么连这一和人民通消息的电话都要“保密”起来？可能某些部门，某些首长的电话要“保密”一下，但是就何以一个可以公开的电话都没有？连电话都不许人民打进来，又如何谈得到联系群众？相反地倒真有些“拒人于千里之外”的味道。后来有人告诉我这可能也是一种“制度”，全国都是一样，不仅云南一省。我查了北京的电话号簿，果然是也查不到北京市委和各区区委的电话。中共中央委员会的电话就更不用说了。
    由这里我又想到另一件事情。也是去年到昆明去，为了工作的需要我去了几次云南大学，碰见了分别二十多年现在云南大学作教授的老同学们；大家自然非常开心，有一位教授约我无论如何在离开昆明之前到她家里去坐坐。和儿时游伴在一起坐坐是“人生难得几回再”的乐事，我在临行头一天早晨绝早起来，沿着翠湖散步到云南大学；谁知走到门口便被看门的给挡住了。我说明来意，得到的答复是三个字：“不见客”。看门人脸上的表情冷若冰霜，决无讨价还价之余地；访友原为高兴之事，犯不上为这吵架生气，我只好默然而退。
    自然这事情又给我一个不明白。连监狱都能接见犯人，这个“不见客”又是一种什么制度呢？好吧，就算是“关门制度”吧。更不明白的是我去过几次云南大学，门口站的同是这位看门人；就是他曾为我热情地指过路的，但是这回为什么一下子就变了脸呢？在低头忧郁地走回翠湖的路上时，我忽然想明白了：前几次我是坐了小汽车去的，最后这一次我是步行去的。问题就在这儿了，看门人“认车不认人”。他知道坐汽车的不是首长，必是贵宾；那么走路的不是人民，便是群众；在“最高学府”里受到这样的待遇真叫人感慨无穷。
    事实上这也不是云南大学一个地方的事情，这些年来所到之处，十之八九，小汽车是兼有通行证的作用的。这就不像打电话那样好找窍门，打电话只有声音，而小汽车则不简单也。
    机关里的某些接电话的人，某些看门人的一些上述的面貌和形象使我很自然地想起京剧“打严嵩”中的严侠来，这位“相府门前七品官，见他容易见我难”是旧社会里趋炎附势、谄上欺下的典型人物。然而千百年来阴魂不散，到了解放后的今天还是根深叶茂的。
    严重的是这种精神，这种意识偏偏不是首长们所能接触和体会得到的。
