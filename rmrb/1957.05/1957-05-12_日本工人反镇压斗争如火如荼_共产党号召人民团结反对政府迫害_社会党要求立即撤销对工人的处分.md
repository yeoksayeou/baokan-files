Xinhua News Agency Report: Japanese trade unions and left-wing political parties strongly oppose the Japanese government's sudden announcement on the 8th of sanctions against numerous leading cadres of unions belonging to the Public Corporation and National Enterprise Labor Relations Council (Korokyo) who participated in the spring struggle demanding wage increases.

As of the evening of the 8th, the Japanese government's postal, printing, paper, national railway, telecommunications, and monopoly business sectors had successively announced sanctions against a total of 956 workers, including dismissals, suspensions, pay cuts, and warnings. In addition, the wages of 340,000 workers will be reduced.

The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), as well as the National Railway Workers' Union (Kokuro), the All Japan Telecommunication Workers' Union (Zendentsu), and the Japan Postal Workers' Union (Zentei), which belong to the Public Corporation and National Enterprise Labor Relations Council, decided to issue statements condemning these sanctions as illegal suppression. They also decided to immediately return the sanction notices and carry out the anti-sanction struggle according to the planned schedule.

The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, which has more than three million members, has decided to launch a struggle against the sanctions on workers starting from the 10th. It has instructed its member unions to hold protest rallies on the 10th, followed by rallies at workplaces on the 11th and 12th to strengthen the struggle. The Public Corporation and National Enterprise Labor Relations Council also made a similar decision on the 9th. National railway workers in Hiroshima have held sit-in strikes, and they clashed with police who were dispatched to suppress them.

Workers from the National Railway Workers' Union and the National Railway Locomotive Engineers' Union, which belong to the Public Corporation and National Enterprise Labor Relations Council, began a two-day show of force on the 11th.

Starting at 9:00 AM, workers from the National Railway Workers' Union held employee rallies at 300 workplaces across the country for three hours. More than 16,500 people participated, accounting for more than 75% of the total number of employees on duty at the time.

The most severely affected by this struggle of the National Railway Workers' Union was the operation of freight trains. A total of 182 freight trains were suspended, and 75 were delayed, with a total delay time of 37 hours, which was even greater than the impact of the third wave of the spring struggle of railway workers this year; 10 passenger trains were also suspended, and 118 were delayed.

In the coal mines of Kyushu, about 700 people participated in the employee rallies held by the seven main stations of the Moji Regional Headquarters of the National Railway Workers' Union. Many workers from the Chikuho coalfield also held demonstrations at stations such as Kokura and Orio, carrying union flags and wearing headbands (Japanese people often wear headbands to show their determination to work hard).

The Hokkaido Coal Miners' Union sent a 200-member picket team to six coal transportation stations, including Sapporo and Kushiro, to participate in the railway workers' employee rallies.

The Fukuoka Prefecture Teachers' Union in Kyushu and other unions also held rallies in various places to protest against the government's sanctions against the National Railway Workers' Union and the suppression of the Saga Prefecture Teachers' Union.

On the 10th, the Japanese Communist Party issued a statement on the Japanese government's measures to persecute workers participating in the spring struggle, saying that the government's aim in taking such measures was to trample on the legitimate rights of workers and their unions, obstruct the development of the domestic democratic movement, and strike at the advanced ranks of the Japanese working class—national railway workers, government agencies, and workers and staff of public corporations and enterprises.

The Communist Party called on the Japanese working class and all Japanese people to unite their forces to oppose the government's persecution measures.

Sanzo Nosaka, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, Yoshio Shiga, a member of the Central Committee of the JCP, and other representatives of the Communist Party visited the union leaders participating in the struggle against the sanctions on workers and declared that the Japanese Communist Party had decided to give its full support.

Shiga Yoshio, leader of the Communist Party's Diet group, and Inajiro Asanuma, Secretary-General of the Socialist Party, met and formulated concrete measures to support the struggles of the various unions.

Socialist Party member Asanuma Inajiro, in a plenary session of the Japanese House of Representatives on the 10th, demanded that the government immediately revoke the sanctions against workers participating in the spring struggle. Asanuma also said that the Socialist Party was prepared to submit a motion of no confidence against Labor Minister Matsuura.

In his reply, Nobusuke Kishi refused to withdraw the illegal sanctions against the workers and stated that he did not agree to restore the right to strike to public corporation unions. At the same time, the cabinet meeting held on the 10th had already made a decision to further suppress the workers, preparing to use police force.

    日本工人反镇压斗争如火如荼
    共产党号召人民团结反对政府迫害  社会党要求立即撤销对工人的处分
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：日本工会和左翼政党强烈反对日本政府8日突然宣布处分参加要求增加工资的春季斗争的公共企业工会协议会所属各工会的许多负责干部。
    截至8日晚上为止，日本政府的邮政、印刷、造纸、国营铁道、电信电话和专卖事业部门已经陆续宣布共要处分九百五十六个工人，处分包括解雇、停职、减薪、警告等。另外，还将扣减三十四万个工人的工资。
    日本工会总评议会以及属于公共企业工会协议会的国营铁道工会、全国电气通信工会和全递信从业员工会等决定发表声明，谴责这种处分是非法镇压，同时决定立刻退还处分通知书，并且要按照预定计划进行反对处分的斗争。
    拥有三百多万会员的日本工会总评议会已经决定从10日起展开反对处分工人的斗争。它已经指示它的会员工会在10日举行抗议大会，接着在11日和12日在工作场所再举行大会，来加强斗争。日本公共企业工会协议会9日也作出了类似的决定。广岛的国营铁道工人已经举行静坐斗争，他们和出动镇压的警察发生了冲突。
    属于公共企业工会协议会的国营铁道工会和国营铁道机车工会等的工人，11日开始了为时两天的实力斗争。
    国营铁道工会的工人从上午九点开始，在全国三百个工作场所举行了历时三小时的职工大会，参加的有一万六千五百多人，占当时上班总人数的75％以上。
    受到国营铁道工会这次斗争的影响最严重的是货车的运行。停开的货车共有一百八十二列，误点的有七十五列，误点时间共达三十七小时，比铁道工人今年春季斗争中的第三次波浪式斗争的影响还要大；旅客列车也有十列停开，有一百十八列误点。
    在九州的煤矿工会有七百人左右参加了国营铁道工会门司地方本部七个主要车站的职工大会。筑丰煤田的许多工人还打着工会会旗，缠着头巾（日本人表示努力奋斗的时候往往缠上头巾）到小仓、折尾等车站举行了示威游行。
    北海道煤矿工会派了二百人的纠察队到札幌、钏路等六个煤炭运输站去参加了铁道工人的职工大会。
    九州福冈县教职员工会等工会也在各地集会抗议，反对政府处分国营铁道工会和镇压佐贺县教职员工会。
    日本共产党10日就日本政府迫害参加春季斗争的工人的措施发表声明说，政府采取这种措施的目的是要蹂躏工人和他们的工会的合法权利以及阻碍国内民主运动的发展，打击日本工人阶级的先进队伍——国营铁道工人、政府机关和公共企业的工人和职员。
    共产党号召日本工人阶级和全体日本人民团结自己的力量反对政府的迫害措施。
    日本共产党中央委员会第一书记野坂参三、日共中央委员志贺义雄以及共产党的其他代表都访问了参加反对处分工人的斗争的工会领导并且声明日本共产党决定给以全力支持。
    共产党国会党团领导人志贺义雄和社会党书记长浅沼稻次郎会晤时，拟订了支援各工会斗争的具体措施。
    社会党议员浅沼稻次郎10日在日本众议院的全体会议上，要求政府立刻撤销对参加春季斗争的工人的处分。浅沼并且说，社会党准备对劳动相松浦提出不信任案。
    岸信介在答复时拒绝收回对工人的非法处分，并且表示不同意恢复公共企业工会的争议权。同时，10日举行的内阁会议已经作出了对工人进行进一步镇压的决定，预备使用警察力量。
