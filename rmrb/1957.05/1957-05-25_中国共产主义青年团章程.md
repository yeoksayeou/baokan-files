The Chinese Communist Youth League is a mass organization of advanced youth in China, a school for learning communism, and an assistant to the Chinese Communist Party.

The Chinese Communist Youth League educates youth in the spirit of communism, helps them continuously raise their ideological awareness, inherit and carry forward the revolutionary traditions of the Chinese people, and make the younger generation of China builders of socialism who love the motherland, are loyal to the people, knowledgeable, disciplined, physically strong, hardworking, brave, full of vigor, and unafraid of any difficulties.

The Chinese Communist Youth League attaches particular importance to conducting labor education among the broad masses of youth, educating them to love labor, respect working people, actively participate in industrial and agricultural production and various construction undertakings, and strive to learn labor skills and cultural and scientific knowledge for building the motherland, opposing the erroneous views of belittling labor, especially physical labor.

The Chinese Communist Youth League requires all members to model themselves in observing the Constitution and laws, faithfully implement the policies of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, and contribute their strength to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship and defend the motherland.

The Chinese Communist Youth League must strengthen the friendship and unity with youths of all nationalities in the country, be good at close cooperation with various youth organizations, learn from each other, and make progress together; constantly be vigilant and overcome the sectarian tendencies of pride and complacency and detachment from the masses.

The Chinese Communist Youth League adheres to the mass line in all its work, frequently listens to the opinions of the masses, reflects the demands of the masses, consults with the masses when problems arise, humbly learns from the masses, and motivates the youth to continuously advance through the exemplary actions and persuasive education of the members. The Youth League must be good at adopting lively and active working methods according to the characteristics of the youth, and carry out independent activities that are beneficial to socialist construction and promote the healthy growth of the youth.

The organizational principle of the Chinese Communist Youth League is democratic centralism. Democracy must be fully promoted in the life of the League, criticism and self-criticism must be carried out regularly, and members should consciously abide by discipline to maintain the political and organizational unity of the League.
