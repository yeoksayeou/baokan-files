    Seeing the Guangdong Han Opera "Bailixi Recognizes His Wife"
    -- Excerpts from Travel Performance Notes in Jiangxi, Hunan, and Hubei
            Mei Lanfang
    I watched a Han opera performance in Wuhan, which reminded me of a Guangdong Han Opera troupe's performance of "Bailixi Recognizes His Wife" that I saw in Guangzhou last summer when I was visiting Japan.

    According to comrades from the Guangdong Provincial Cultural Bureau, Han opera entered Guangdong during the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty and was well-received. It took root and gradually developed, experiencing a period of prosperity and has been around for over two hundred years. Before liberation, due to displacement during the Anti-Japanese War and the reactionary rule's disregard for artistic heritage, many Guangdong Han opera performers suffered from hunger, cold, and illness, and died one after another. After liberation, under the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new," the nearly extinct Guangdong Han opera was revived. The current head of the Han Opera Troupe, Comrade Huang Guizhu, and Comrade Huang Linchuan are the main actors in the revival of Guangdong Han Opera. "Bailixi Recognizes His Wife" is performed by these two comrades. This play left a deep impression on me, and now I would like to take this opportunity to talk about it, hoping to attract the attention of those who love Han opera and the comrades in the Han opera circles.

    The plot of this play is extremely simple. Bailixi, holding the position of prime minister, misses his long-lost wife and is depressed. His servant finds a poor woman who sells songs on the street to cheer him up. The poor woman uses a Pipa melody and a Qin tune to explain that she is Bailixi's wife, Ms. Du, and the couple is finally reunited. Comrade Huang Linchuan plays Bailixi. When he enters the stage, he first sings four lines, articulating clearly, with a strong projection of voice. The key seems slightly lower than the Han opera I heard in Wuhan. The singing is concise and flavorful, and the expression and movements are steady and contain a sense of melancholy. From this segment of singing, dialogue, and acting, the identity of Bailixi and his mood and environment at the time are first outlined. The old servant goes to the street to find the poor woman and brings her into the Prime Minister's mansion. Bailixi then grants her a low seat, and the poor woman begins to sing and play. Comrade Huang Guizhu, who plays Ms. Du, conforms to the identity of a Qingyi (a dignified female role) in terms of appearance, voice, and movements. The Pipa melody consists of lines of varying lengths. I will now excerpt this segment of lyrics:

    "I recall… In those years, he and I were inseparable, like mandarin ducks. Today, I am left alone, lamenting my misery, counting the years, more than thirty years of wandering in foreign lands. Alas, alas! Thinking of my husband, who is righteous and affectionate, since heaven bestowed this marriage, why did the fate end so quickly? Alas heaven, alas heaven! I resent heaven, resent the quick end. Why did we become so close in the beginning? As if there was fate, as if there was no fate, yet we are at opposite ends of the earth, at the ends of the earth. Tearful person, alas person, now I ask heaven, where can I find him in the vast sea of people? Alas heartless man, you change after a long separation, leaving me like duckweed tossed by the waves, a kite with a broken string, drifting and wandering, where can I find you?"

    These lyrics are simple and contain the meaning of ancient folk songs. Comrade Huang Guizhu moved the audience with her clear and mellow voice and her gentle and sorrowful tone. She does not use fancy singing techniques to attract the audience but focuses on expressing the mournful feelings of the character who has been searching for her husband for thousands of miles. While the poor woman is singing and playing, Bailixi is always looking at a book, but we can clearly see that he is listening attentively. He gets up several times, walks slowly a few steps on the big side of the stage, and glances at the poor woman, which is all profound and thought-provoking.

    看广东汉剧“百里奚认妻”
    ——摘自赣、湘、鄂旅行演出手记
            梅兰芳
    我在武汉看了汉剧，不禁使我回想到去年夏天访问日本路过广州时看到的广东汉剧团一出“百里奚认妻”。　
    据广东省文化局的同志向我介绍说：汉剧在清代乾隆年间流入广东，受到欢迎，生了根并逐渐发展，曾经有过一个繁荣时期，流至今已有二百多年的历史。在解放前，由于抗日战争时期的流离失所和反动统治的轻视艺术遗产，广东汉剧许多艺人饥寒病苦，死亡相继。解放后，在“百花齐放，推陈出新”的方针下，奄奄一息的广东汉剧得到复苏，现在的汉剧团团长黄桂珠、黄磷传两位同志，就是复兴广东汉剧的主要演员。“百里奚认妻”，就是由这两位同志表演的。这出戏给我深刻的印象，现在我愿乘此机会谈一谈，希望引起爱好汉剧和汉剧界各位同志的注意。
    这出戏的剧情是极其简单的，百里奚官居宰相，思念他久已失散的妻子，闷闷不乐，家院找来一个沿街卖唱的贫妇给他解闷，这位贫妇从一段琵琶调和一段琴曲里说明了她就是百里奚的妻子杜氏，夫妻才得相认。黄磷传同志扮百里奚，上场先唱四句，咬字清楚，喷口有劲，调门似乎比我在武汉听的汉剧稍低，行腔简练而有味，表情身段稳重而含有一种抑郁的意态。从这段唱、念、做工方面，先勾画出百里奚的身份和他当时的心情环境。老家院到街上找来贫妇，带进相府，百里奚就赐他一个矮座，这个贫妇就弹唱起来。黄桂珠同志扮演的杜氏，从扮相、嗓音、身段上看，都符合青衣的身份。琵琶调是长短句，我现在把这段唱词节录出来：
    忆当年……奴和他形双影对好比鸳鸯，今日里只落得形单影只叹凄凉，屈指数流年似水三十余载漂泊他乡。嗳哟，嗳哟！想夫君重义多情，既天赐姻缘，姻缘何快尽？嗳唷天，嗳唷天！怨苍天，怨快尽，当初为何相亲相近。似有缘，似无缘，咫尺天涯边，天涯边。含泪人，嗳唷人，到如今问苍天，人海茫茫何处寻？嗳唷薄情人，别久变心，累得我似浪打浮萍，线断风筝，飘飘荡荡何处寻。
    这段唱词朴素而含有古代民歌的意味。黄桂珠同志以清亮圆润的嗓音，婉转凄凉的声调，感动了观众的心。她不用花巧的行腔来吸引观众，而是着重在表达剧中人千里寻夫的哀怨心情。当贫妇弹唱的时候，百里奚始终是拿一本书看着，但我们清楚地看出他在凝神细听，中间曾几次站起来在台的大边很缓慢的走几步，淡淡的看那贫妇一眼，这种表演，都是深刻而耐人寻味的。
