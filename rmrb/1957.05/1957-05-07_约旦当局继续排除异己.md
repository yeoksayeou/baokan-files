    Amman dispatch: Jordanian authorities announced a purge of civil servants on May 5th. Jordanian Prime Minister Hashim, in a notice issued to various government departments, said that those civil servants who were “not performing their duties” would be dismissed. According to Agence France-Presse, the dismissals are apparently aimed at those civil servants who left their posts during the Jordanian political crisis and those who were “detained”.

    Another Jordanian government communiqué stated that the cabinet has decided to empower itself to remove any senior civil servant from office, and ministers have also been authorized to “purge personnel who participate in political parties.”

    The Jordanian cabinet also ordered the revocation of licenses for the organs of patriotic political parties such as the National Socialist Party, the Communist Party, the Arab Ba'ath Party, and the National Front, dissolved the Arab Students Congress, and decided to close five weekly magazines run by the dissolved political parties. At the same time, the acting Chief of Staff of the Jordanian Army, the Bedouin Majali, a supporter of King Hussein, was appointed as Chief of Staff. Police in the Jordanian capital, Amman, were ordered to suppress demonstrating patriotic people and were met with resistance from the masses.

    约旦当局继续排除异己
    本报讯　安曼消息：约旦当局5月5日宣布对公务人员实行清洗。约旦首相哈希姆在给政府各部门发出的通知中说要解除那些“不到职”的公务人员的职务。据法新社说，免职的对象显然是那些在约旦政治危机期间离职和“被扣押的公务人员”。
    另据约旦政府的一项公报说，内阁已决定使自己有权免去任何高级公务人员的职务，各部大臣们也被授权可以“清除参加政党的人员”。
    约旦内阁还下令取消国家社会党、共产党、阿拉伯复兴党和全国阵线等爱国政党机关的执照，解散了阿拉伯学生大会，并决定封闭被解散的各政党所办的五家周刊。与此同时，约旦陆军代理参谋长、支持侯赛因国王的贝都印人马贾利被任命为参谋长。约旦首都安曼的警察奉令镇压示威的爱国人民，受到群众的反击。
