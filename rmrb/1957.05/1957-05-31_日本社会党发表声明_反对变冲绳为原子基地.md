    Japanese Socialist Party Issues Statement
    Opposes Turning Okinawa into an Atomic Base

    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 30th: The Japanese Socialist Party issued a statement today opposing the United States turning Okinawa Island into a nuclear weapons base.

    The statement said: The U.S. military in Okinawa has announced that it will begin establishing "Nike" missile bases in Okinawa. "Nike" is a nuclear weapon capable of mounting nuclear warheads. The U.S. military previously shipped "Honest John" rockets to Okinawa, and now it is about to ship "Nike" missiles, and is carrying out activities to make Okinawa an atomic weapons base.

    The statement pointed out: This is the prelude to sending atomic forces to Okinawa according to the plan of U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Radford. In addition, the U.S. military is doing its utmost to build the Far East into a nuclear weapons base. For example, the United States is preparing to ship "Matador" missiles to Taiwan and equip South Korea with nuclear weapons. This will not only fail to guarantee Japan's security, but will also aggravate the international tension around Japan, deepen the crisis of nuclear war, and increase the danger of the extinction of the Japanese nation.

    Xinhua News Agency, May 30th: The U.S. Department of Defense announced yesterday that the United States is planning to build missile bases on Okinawa Island. According to today's "Mainichi Shimbun" of Japan, the United States plans to build as many as eight missile bases on Okinawa Island.

    The "Mainichi Shimbun" said that the U.S. military authorities in Okinawa said yesterday that the United States will use 100 million US dollars to build these bases. Construction is expected to begin this fall and be completed in a year.

    The people of Okinawa Island and the Japanese public have been strongly opposed to the U.S. attempt to turn Okinawa Island into an atomic base.

    日本社会党发表声明
    反对变冲绳为原子基地
    据新华社30日讯　东京消息：日本社会党今天发表声明，反对美国把冲绳岛变成原子武器基地。
    声明说：冲绳美军宣布要在冲绳开始建立“奈克”导弹基地。“奈克”是能够安装原子弹头的原子武器。美军以前曾经向冲绳运进“诚实的约翰”火箭，现在又要运进“奈克”导弹，正在进行着使冲绳成为原子武器基地的活动。
    声明指出：这是根据美国参谋长联席会议主席雷德福的计划要向冲绳派驻原子部队的先声。另外，美军正以全力要把远东地区建成为原子武器基地。例如美国正在准备把“斗牛士”式导弹运进台湾，用原子武器装备南朝鲜。这不但不能保障日本的安全，反而会加剧日本周围的国际紧张局势，加深原子战争的危机，增加了使日本民族灭亡的危险。
    新华社30日讯　美国国防部昨天宣布，美国正计划在冲绳岛建立导弹基地。据日本“每日新闻”今天透露，美国准备在冲绳岛建立的导弹基地将达八个之多。
    “每日新闻”说，冲绳的美军当局在昨天说，美国将用一亿美元来建立这些基地。预料建设工程将从今年秋天开始，一年后完工。
    冲绳岛人民和日本公众一直在强烈反对美国企图把冲绳岛变成原子基地的计划。
