Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 8th: The Kerala Legislative Assembly in India passed the Governor's policy address with a majority vote on May 7th. The address clarified the policies of the state government under the leadership of the Communist Party of India.

Prior to the vote, Kerala Chief Minister E.M.S. Namboodiripad, in concluding the debate, reiterated the state government's determination to reduce unemployment through land reform and the development of heavy industry and cottage industries. He said the state government would firmly adhere to the election manifesto issued by the Communist Party before the election.

During the debate on the Governor's address, all opposition parties—the Congress Party, the Praja Socialist Party, and the Muslim League—united in opposition to the address. They said that the rule of the Communists had created an atmosphere of unease in the state. They also criticized the state government's decision to reduce sentences, grant pardons, and release political prisoners.

Namboodiripad refuted these claims in his response. He said that only the large landowners were feeling uneasy, because they believed that the Communist state government would implement land reform and therefore planned to大规模收回 [recover on a large scale] the land of tenant farmers. It was precisely to eliminate this "unease" among the poor tenant farmers that the state government promulgated a decree prohibiting the repossession of land.

The Kerala Legislative Assembly began its session on April 27th. It is currently considering a bill to prevent any repossession of leased land and a bill to determine the salaries of ministers.

    印度喀拉拉邦将推行新政
    立法会议通过邦长政策演说
    据新华社新德里8日电　印度喀拉拉邦立法会议5月7日以多数票通过邦长的政策演说，演说阐明了印度共产党领导下的邦政府的政策。
    表决以前，喀拉拉邦首席部长南布迪里巴德在结束辩论的时候重申邦政府决心通过土地改革和发展重工业和家庭手工业的办法来减少失业现象。他说，邦政府将坚决恪守共产党在选举以前所发表的竞选宣言。
    在辩论邦长演说过程中，所有的反对党——国大党、人民社会党和穆斯林联盟——都联合一致反对这篇演说。它们说，共产党人执政已经在邦内造成不安的气氛。它们还批评邦政府减刑、免刑和释放政治犯的决定。
    南布迪里巴德在答复中驳斥了这种说法。他说，感到不安的只是大地主们，他们认为共产党邦政府将实行土地改革，因此计划大规模收回佃户的土地。正是为了消除贫苦佃农的这种“不安”，邦政府才颁布禁止收回土地的法令。
    喀拉拉邦立法会议从4月27日开始举行。它目前正在考虑关于阻止任何收回租地的法案和决定部长们薪金的法案。
