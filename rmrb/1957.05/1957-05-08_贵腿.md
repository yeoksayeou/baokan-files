    Noble Legs
    Zang Kejia
    From the east building to the west building, the distance seems like an uncrossable chasm. He and the staff gaze at each other from afar. In reality, opportunities for contact are almost non-existent. All matters are handled through written correspondence, wearing out the legs of the messengers. Documents are like a vast ocean, and this leader, neither too big nor too small, spends all day submerged within them. Swish, swish, swish, he wields his pen with a flourish, causing a stir among the cadres. His comments are truly sharp, leaving people not knowing whether to laugh or cry. The cadres discuss amongst themselves, reciting his comments as if they were essays. The reality is often the opposite of what he has written, completely irrelevant. The east building and west building seem like far away lands, he doesn't take the time to get close to the masses, happy to sit in his swivel chair, wielding his pen on paper. His noble legs refuse to move even an inch.

    贵腿
    臧克家东楼到西楼，中间好似有一条鸿沟，他和工作人员遥遥相望，实在说，接触的机会少到没
  有。有事情一律书面往还，把传递员的两腿跑酸，文件像个茫茫大海，这位不大不小的首长终天泡
  在里边。唰，唰，唰，他大笔一挥，惹得干部们骚动一阵，他的批语真尖锐，弄得人啼笑皆非。干部们纷纷议论，把批语当文章朗诵，事实和他批的恰恰相反，真是马嘴不对驴唇。东楼西楼好像天涯，没工夫去接近一下群众，乐于坐在转椅上纸面挥毫，他的贵腿却不肯动一动。（附图片）
