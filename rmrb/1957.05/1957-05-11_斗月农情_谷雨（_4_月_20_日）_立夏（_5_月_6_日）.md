    Farming Situation in Dou Month
    Grain Rain (April 20) - Start of Summer (May 6)
    Early Rice Transplanting Just Ended
    Mid-Season Rice Transplanting Begins Again
    As the season just entered the "Start of Summer," early rice transplanting in various parts of the South has come to an end (the planting area is slightly larger than last year's 108 million mu); mid-season rice transplanting has begun; single-crop late rice has already been sown; and preparations before sowing double-cropping late rice are underway in full swing.

    In Guangdong, where the season is earlier, the transplanting area had reached 90% of the planned area (approximately 30 million mu) by the end of April. Hainan Island and the counties in the high-yield Shantou Plain have already started mid-season management. Sichuan is weeding rice seedlings. Hunan and Jiangxi provinces can complete transplanting after the Start of Summer. Zhejiang Province is intensifying transplanting from the end of April to the beginning of May.

    This year, many regions have paid attention to promoting advanced technologies. In Guangdong Province, over 90% of rice fields adopted small-row close planting (compared to only 80% last year). Some areas in Fujian Province learned from last year's lessons and changed the uniform close planting standards. Based on soil quality and drawing on the experience of veteran farmers, they proposed different close planting requirements.

    This year, the seedlings in Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Zhejiang, Anhui and other provinces are growing very well. Except for a few areas, there was no phenomenon of being unable to transplant seedlings during the transplanting period. Therefore, generally speaking, early rice transplanting this year is relatively timely; even in some areas of Guangdong and Fujian, where there is more rain, the early growth of seedlings was slow, but after processing and cultivation, they caught up with the transplanting season.

    However, the spring cold lasted longer this year, and large-scale planting of double-cropping rice requires early planting of early rice. Some areas cannot transplant after the "Start of Summer." Therefore, the spring farming scene in the South is: rushing forward. This makes it easy to produce poor quality. Therefore, after "Grain Rain," newspapers in Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, and Guangxi, which are major rice-producing areas, published editorials calling for early and good transplanting of early rice. From the reports in local newspapers, many places have already experienced shortages of seedlings, seedling rot, broken ridges, and uneven transplanting. In areas where transplanting has been completed, many cadres and people have become complacent, thinking that everything will be fine after transplanting. Some people even say: "The seedlings grow in the field, and people lie at home." In addition, many places have also reported a lack of topdressing fertilizer. These situations and problems are worth noting and solving.

    Cotton Sowing Basically Completed
    Cotton Seedlings Growing Fast and Vigorously
    The sowing work in most cotton-producing areas of the country has been basically completed. As of April 30, the Liaocheng and Huimin areas, which are major cotton-producing areas in Shandong Province, had completed 93% of the planned sowing acreage. The agricultural production and construction corps in the Manas River basin of Xinjiang overcame the recent rain and snow obstacles three times, and 300,000 mu of cotton fields have been sown; only the sowing period has been extended by about a week compared to previous years. The Hexi Corridor is a new cotton area in our country, and it plans to plant 260,000 mu of cotton this year. Sowing began in late April.

    Many cotton fields have already emerged seedlings; the early ones have emerged uniformly and have begun mid-tillage and weeding. The early seedlings in the 4.75 million mu of cotton fields in Shaanxi Province are growing quite neatly. The cotton-growing areas in Shandong are inspecting and replanting seedlings, striving for vigorous growth of cotton seedlings. In Jiangxi and Hubei, early-sown cotton seedlings are already two to four inches high.

    This year, due to good soil moisture and timely sowing, the cotton seedlings emerged quickly and vigorously, and the peasant masses are generally satisfied with this year's cotton seedlings.

    Northern Winter Wheat is Heading
    Southern Wheat Has Entered the Scene
    The winter wheat in various places is generally growing very well. The best wheat plants in Jiangsu Province have grown to more than two feet tall, with hard bases and thick stalks. The early Yuan wheat here (lower yield than wheat, but earlier maturity) will begin to be harvested around May 10, and areas with spring famine can also receive food rations. In Henan Province, there was continuous spring rain at the end of April. Except for the hilly areas in northwestern and western Henan, the wheat seedlings are growing very well, and more than 70 million mu of wheat are already heading. Wheat in the Guanzhong area and the southern Shaanxi plain is flowering and heading; the wheat in the eastern counties of this province is already more than one foot tall. Agricultural cooperatives in Guanzhong are applying plant ash to the wheat fields to prevent wheat lodging. Some agricultural cooperatives are preventing wheat spider mites and wheat midges. More than 60% of the 16 million mu of wheat in Shanxi has been harrowed, rolled, and irrigated.

    While wheat seedlings are growing and developing in various parts of the North, some areas in the South have already harvested wheat. According to reports in late April: The harvesting of wheat and barley has been completed in the central and eastern counties of Fujian.

    Several provinces are studying this year's wheat pre-distribution methods, and some places are conducting pre-distribution pilot projects.

      Rapeseed Has Ripened
      A Bumper Harvest is Expected This Year
    Currently, it is also the season for harvesting rapeseed. In the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, Hunan, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and other provinces, rapeseed has ripened and is being harvested intensively. Guangdong, Yunnan, Sichuan, southern Hunan and other places, and areas where early-maturing rapeseed varieties are cultivated, have already completed the harvest.

    Sichuan Province, which has the largest rapeseed cultivation area and the highest yield per unit area in the country, is expected to increase rapeseed production this year compared to last year. According to a survey of key agricultural cooperatives and farms in seven counties, including Shehong, Nanchong, and Wenjiang, the yield per unit area of ​​early-maturing rapeseed is generally about 200 jin per mu. Yunnan's rapeseed is expected to increase production by 60% compared to 1956.

    Central China suffered from drought during sowing last winter, but Hunan and Hubei can complete their planned rapeseed production this year, only Jiangxi has difficulties.

    Except for Anhui, where rapeseed growth is relatively poor, Zhejiang is expected to exceed the increase target. Rapeseed growth in Jiangsu is also better than last year, and it is estimated that production can be increased by 10%-15%.

    Judging from the rapeseed growth in the winter-sowing areas, as long as there are no special natural disasters, harvesting is timely, and fine threshing is done, it is possible to complete this year's rapeseed production increase task.

    Gansu Long Drought Meets Sweet Rain
    Jiangxi and Other Places Suffer Heavy Rainstorms
    From May 1 to the morning of May 4, it rained throughout Gansu Province. In particular, the severely drought-stricken areas in the central region received more rainfall, with more than ten or twenty millimeters. This is great news for the people of Gansu. Now the farmers in Gansu are happily rushing to plant autumn crops. Prior to this, more than one million mu of land could not be sown due to the prolonged drought.

    In mid to late April, rain fell widely in the provinces of the Yangtze River basin.

    As of April 30, the rainfall in Jiangxi had reached 300 millimeters. The water levels of all rivers have generally risen, and the peak flood of the Xiu and Liao rivers once exceeded the warning water level. The rainfall in Hunan is generally around 100 millimeters, which is less than in Jiangxi, but it has also caused mountain floods, and some farmland and farmland water conservancy facilities have been damaged.

    On the evening of April 21, five counties in the Hengyang area of ​​Hunan were attacked by hail. The largest hailstones weighed two or three jin. Seedling fields and other crops in more than twenty townships were damaged, and people and livestock were also injured. The affected people received timely assistance from the local party and government, their emotions were stable, and they are replanting and repairing houses. In Hubei, from the end of April to the beginning of May, for more than a week, the rainfall in various places was above 60 millimeters, but the Dabie Mountain area reached 135 millimeters. Because of the heavy rain, the small corn and cotton sprouts that had just emerged in some places were broken by the storm or soaked in water. Wheat that was flowering was also affected. During this period, Jiangsu and Anhui were also rainy and overcast. However, drought appeared in Guizhou Province at this time.

### 斗月农情  谷雨（4月20日）——立夏（5月6日）

    斗月农情
    谷雨（4月20日）——立夏（5月6日）
    早稻插秧刚结束
    中稻插秧又开始
    时序刚到了“立夏”，南方各地早稻插秧已告结束（种植面积比去年的一亿零八百多万亩略有增加）；中稻开始插秧；一季晚稻已经播种；双季连作晚稻播种前的准备工作，正紧张进行。
    季节较早的广东，在4月底，插秧面积已占计划面积的90％（约三千万亩）。海南岛和高产的汕头平原各县，已在中耕。四川已在薅秧。湖南、江西两省立夏过后，即可插完。浙江全省从4月底到5月初正加劲插秧。
    今年许多地区都注意了推广先进技术。广东省采用小科密植的稻田达90％以上（去年只占80％）。福建省有些地方，吸取了去年的教训，改变了密植标准通通一律的做法，根据田地土质，吸取老农经验，提出不同的密植要求。
    今年江西、湖南、湖北、浙江、安徽等省的秧苗都生长得很好。插秧期间除个别地区外，没有发生过插不下秧的现象。因此，一般来说，今年早稻插秧比较适时；即使在阴雨较多的广东、福建部分地区，秧苗前期生长缓慢，经过加工培育以后，也赶上了插秧季节。
    不过，今年春寒较长，而大量种植双季稻又要求早稻早种早插。有些地区迟过“立夏”就不能再插。因此，南方的春耕图景就是：往前赶。这样，也就容易产生质量不好的现象。因此，“谷雨”以后，盛产水稻的湖南、湖北、四川、广西的报纸都发表社论，提出早稻既要早插又要插好的号召。从各地报纸的报道中看，已经有不少地方发生缺秧、烂秧、断垅和插得不均匀的现象。在已经插好秧的地区，也有不少干部和群众出现松劲情绪，以为插完秧后就万事大吉了。有些人甚至说：“秧在田里长，人在家里躺”。此外，许多地方还反映缺乏追肥。这些情况和问题都是值得注意和解决的。
    棉田播种基本完毕
    棉苗长得又快又旺
    全国大部分产棉区的播种工作已经基本结束。山东省盛产棉花的聊城、惠民等几个专区，截至4月30日，已完成了计划播种亩数的93％。新疆玛纳斯河流域的农业生产建设部队三次战胜了最近的雨雪阻挠，三十万亩棉田已经播完；只是播种期比往年延长了一星期左右。河西走廊是我国的新棉区，今年计划种棉二十六万亩。4月下旬已开始播种。
    不少棉田已经出苗；早的已经齐苗，并开始中耕除草工作。陕西省四百七十五万亩棉田，出苗早的，都长得挺整齐。山东棉区正在查苗补苗，争取棉苗长得旺盛。江西、湖北早播棉田，棉苗已有二到四寸高。
    今年由于墒情好，播种及时，棉苗出得快而且旺，农民群众看着今年的棉苗一般都很满意。
    北方冬麦正孕穗
    南方麦子已登场
    各地的冬小麦一般都长得很好。江苏省最好的麦株已长到二尺多高，脚硬秆粗。这里的早元麦（比小麦产量低，但成熟期早）5月10日左右就要开始收割，有春荒的地区也可以接上口粮。河南省在4月底连降春雨，除豫北豫西丘陵地区外，麦苗都长得很好，有七千多万亩小麦已经在孕穗。陕西关中地区和陕南平川地区的小麦在扬花抽穗；这省东部各县的麦子已有一尺多高。关中的农业社正在麦地施草木灰，防止小麦伏倒。有些农业社正在防治麦蜘蛛和吸浆虫。山西一千六百多万亩小麦已有60％进行耙耱、磙压、浇水。
    在北方各地麦苗正在生长发育的时候，南方有些地区早已收完小麦。据4月下旬的报道：福建的中部偏东各县，大小麦都已收割完了。
    好几个省都在研究今年的小麦预分方法，有些地方在作预分试点工作。
      油菜已经黄熟
      今年可望丰收
    目前，又正是收割油菜的季节。长江中下游的湖南、江西、江苏、浙江等省，油菜已经黄熟，正在紧张收获。广东、云南、四川、湖南南部等地和栽培早熟油菜品种的地区，已经收获完毕。
    全国油菜栽培面积最大、单位面积产量最高的四川省，今年油菜产量可望比去年增加。据这省射洪、南充、温江等七个县的重点农业社和农场的调查，早熟油菜单位面积产量高的一般每亩可达二百斤左右。云南的油菜，预计可以比1956年增产60％。
    华中地区去冬播种时候遭到干旱，但湖南、湖北今年油菜产量都可完成计划，只有江西有困难。
    长江下游除安徽油菜生长比较差以外，浙江预计可以超额完成增产任务。江苏油菜生长也比去年好，估计可以增产10％—15％。
    从冬播地区油菜生长情况看，只要没有特殊的自然灾害，收割适时，做到精细脱粒，完成今年油菜增产任务是可能的。
    甘肃久旱逢甘霖
    江西等地下暴雨
    甘肃省自5月1日到4日早晨止，全省都下雨了。特别是中部干旱严重地区，雨量较多，有十多二十公厘。这是甘肃人民的大喜讯。现在甘肃农民正欢欣鼓舞抢种大秋作物。在此以前，有一百多万亩地因久旱不能下种。
    4月中下旬，长江流域各省普遍下雨。
    江西截止至4月30日降雨量已达三百公厘。各河水位普遍上涨，修、缭两河洪峰一度超过警戒水位。湖南降雨量一般在百公厘，比江西较小，但也引起山洪，农田和农田水利设施也冲坏了一部分。
    4月21日晚间，湖南衡阳专区有五个县却又遭到了冰雹的袭击。最大的雹子有两三斤。有二十多个乡的秧田和其他农作物都受了损失，人畜也有损伤。受灾群众及时得到了当地党政方面的帮助，情绪安定，正在补种和修葺房屋。湖北从4月底到5月初一个多星期里面，各地下的雨都在六十公厘以上，不过大别山区却达到一百三十五公厘。因为夹有暴雨，致使一些地方刚出土的玉米，棉花小嫩芽被暴风打断，或者浸泡在水里。正在扬花的小麦也受到影响。这个期间，江苏、安徽也阴雨连绵。但是，在贵州省这时候又出现了旱象。
