Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, May 27th: The Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party will convene a national party congress in the latter half of June this year.

Currently, state party congresses are being held throughout the country. At the congresses held in Nógrád, Békés, and other states, discussions were held on the work of the state party organizations since their establishment and their future tasks. Many delegates who spoke during the discussions pointed out that it is necessary to further strengthen the work of purging counter-revolutionaries, prevent complacency after the victory in suppressing the counter-revolutionary riots, strengthen the leadership of the Party, strengthen the ties between the Party and the masses, and eliminate the sectarianism, chauvinism, and revisionist ideological influences that still exist within the Party. Some delegates also suggested that the national party congress formulate corresponding measures to better consolidate the unity of the Party and ensure the purity of the Party.

Delegates to attend the national party congress were also elected at these meetings.
