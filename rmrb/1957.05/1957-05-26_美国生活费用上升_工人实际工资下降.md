Xinhua News Agency, Washington, May 25th: The U.S. government announced on May 24th that the U.S. cost of living index rose to an unprecedented level in April. The index for that month was 119.3 (with the average index for 1947-49 being 100), an increase of 3.8% compared to April of last year. The rise in the cost of living is due to a sharp increase in food prices and a general increase in the prices of many other consumer goods.

The U.S. government also announced on the same day that in April, the average weekly income of a single worker in the United States after taxes was $67.09, compared to $65.08 a year ago. The government's published materials state that although the nominal wages of these workers have increased, due to rising prices, the purchasing power of workers in April of this year actually decreased by about 1% compared to April of last year.

    美国生活费用上升
    工人实际工资下降
    据新华社25日讯　华盛顿消息：美国政府5月24日宣布，美国生活费用指数在4月份上升到空前未有的水平。这一个月的指数是一百一十九点三（以1947—49年的平均指数为一百），比去年4月份上升了3.8％。生活费用上涨的原因是粮食价格急剧上涨以及其他许多消费品的价格普遍增加。
    美国政府同一天还宣布，4月份美国一个单身工人在纳税后的平均每周收入是六十七点零九美元，一年前是六十五点零八美元。政府公布的材料说，虽然这些工人的名义工资增加了，但是由于物价的上涨，工人的购买力在今年4月份实际上比去年4月份减少了约1％。
