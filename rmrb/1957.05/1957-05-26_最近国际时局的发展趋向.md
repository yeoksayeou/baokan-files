Recent developments in the international situation over the past two weeks demonstrate that the overall situation continues to trend towards relaxation. This is the result of the efforts of the socialist camp led by the Soviet Union and many peace-loving, anti-war countries around the world. In this situation, the United States appears very awkward. On the one hand, it is still trying its best to continue creating tension and obstructing the relaxation of the situation; on the other hand, it cannot help but make some conciliatory gestures on certain issues, attempting to advance by retreating, to control the development of the situation.

The United States is in a Dilemma in Disarmament Negotiations

The relaxation of the international situation is manifested in the new situation that has emerged on the issue of disarmament.

The United Nations Disarmament Subcommittee, meeting in London, adjourned temporarily on May 17 after two months of discussion, and is scheduled to resume on May 27. This adjournment was to allow the governments of the participating countries time to study a new Soviet proposal of April 30 regarding partial disarmament measures. The most important point of this proposal is that the Soviet Union has taken new steps on the issue of international supervision, suggesting aerial photography in vast areas of both East and West in Europe, Asia, and the Americas. This Soviet proposal has deprived the so-called "Open Skies" plan, which the United States has advocated since 1955, of its role in obstructing the reaching of an agreement on disarmament. Therefore, many countries that have been hoping for disarmament, as well as many Western European countries in the North Atlantic Group, are very pleased and believe that there is hope for reaching a disarmament agreement.

The Soviet proposal put the United States in a very passive position. If the old methods are used to reject it, the United States' face of unwillingness to ease the international situation will be completely exposed. In the words of the Associated Press, this "could discredit U.S. policy in some dangerous and neutral areas." If the Soviet proposal is agreed to, the international situation will be further relaxed, which is what the United States least wants. In this dilemma, the United States warned the North Atlantic Group countries not to be "unrealistically optimistic" about the prospect of reaching a disarmament agreement, while at the same time indicating that it would "study in detail" the Soviet proposal. However, the sincerity of the Soviet proposal is so obvious that it is very difficult for the United States to completely deny it.

There are two opinions within the U.S. ruling group on how to deal with the Soviet proposal. One opinion, represented by Eisenhower, Stassen, and the State Department, believes that outright rejection is impossible because it would strengthen the centrifugal tendencies within the North Atlantic Group and completely fail the U.S.'s European policy. They advocate proposing a counter-offer for bargaining.

The other opinion, represented by Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Radford, believes that even the prospect of reaching a possible disarmament agreement is very dangerous. This is because it would make Western European countries even more hesitant to equip themselves with U.S. atomic weapons. Therefore, he calls for a "very cautious attitude."

The U.S. National Security Council is now studying what to do next. According to Reuters, Dulles told the Senate Disarmament Subcommittee that continuing to discuss a disarmament agreement is dangerous, but stopping the discussion of a disarmament agreement is also dangerous. This quite clearly states the U.S.'s current situation. According to information released by the U.S., the U.S. may propose a "first step" plan to implement a "small reduction in armaments" and establish an experimental aerial inspection system. However, the U.S. will refuse to immediately ban atomic and nuclear weapons.

It can be seen from this news that the United States cannot help but make some conciliatory gestures to appease the demands of the people of various countries, but it does not want to solve the key and urgent issue - the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction. However, it is becoming increasingly difficult for the U.S. to avoid solving this problem. It is said that Dulles said in the Senate Disarmament Subcommittee that there are two dangers in stopping disarmament talks: one is that "nuclear weapons may soon become widespread," and the other is that "military expenditures will certainly increase." Dulles' first "danger" reflects the U.S.'s fear that it has lost its monopoly on nuclear weapons, even within the imperialist camp. The second "danger" he mentioned shows that the opposition of the American people and the people of Western European countries to the increasing military expenditures has reached a point that cannot be ignored.

Britain is Unwilling to be Subordinate to the United States

On May 15, Britain exploded its first hydrogen bomb at Christmas Island. This ended the U.S.'s monopoly on nuclear weapons in the capitalist world. The U.S.'s blockade of atomic intelligence to Britain also failed to save the U.S.'s monopoly. Britain now has more bargaining chips with the United States.

Britain's hydrogen bomb test was carried out at a time when the people of all countries in the world are increasingly strongly demanding a halt to hydrogen bomb tests and a ban on the use of atomic and nuclear weapons. This anti-nuclear weapons movement is now growing in scale. Many well-known scientists in various countries have recently issued statements calling on scientists to refuse to work on the manufacture of nuclear weapons. In Britain and the United States, many religious groups, members of parliament, and ordinary citizens have participated in the struggle to demand a halt to hydrogen bomb tests and a ban on nuclear weapons.

However, the British government resolutely ignored the opposition of the people and tested its hydrogen bomb. It is said that Britain's insistence on testing the hydrogen bomb is part of its effort to restore its status as a major power. Therefore, in a sense, it is also a manifestation of Britain's resistance to the United States. No wonder British Prime Minister Macmillan repeatedly boasted that Britain's hydrogen bomb test put it in an "equal position" with the United States and the Soviet Union.

Since Britain's failed invasion of Egypt, the United States has made no secret of its claim to be the leader of the capitalist world, mocking Britain's decline and squeezing Britain out everywhere. In the Middle East, the United States is replacing Britain. In Europe, the United States is establishing a U.S.-West Germany axis, supporting West Germany, and weakening Britain's influence and position in Europe. In Africa, the United States has shown increasing interest in the colonies of Britain and other European countries, and is also actively expanding U.S. influence and power.

However, Britain is not willing to become a second-rate country. Over the past two weeks, there have been various indications that Britain is increasingly acting independently of the United States to restore its position and influence. British Ambassador to the United States Caccia warned the United States "not to make the same miscalculation as others and not take Britain into account." This is very interesting.

On the issue of major power talks, Britain has different opinions from the United States. British officials and public opinion circles have expressed great interest in the letter sent by Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Bulganin to Prime Minister Macmillan last month. The general view is that Macmillan should strive to hold talks with Soviet leaders. The United Press reported on May 20 that if Macmillan could not arrange a four-power summit, he would hold talks with the Soviet Union alone. Britain has disagreements with the United States and France on the Soviet note of April 19 regarding the Middle East issue. According to Reuters, Britain tends to be willing to talk to the Soviet Union in order to improve Britain's relations with the Soviet Union and Middle Eastern countries, while the United States and France have expressed opposition.

Regarding the Middle East, Britain has made it clear that it is unwilling to be completely squeezed out by the United States. It is taking a more realistic approach and adjusting its relations with Middle Eastern countries. Britain has announced that it will use the Suez Canal in accordance with Egyptian conditions. Negotiations with Egypt on economic issues began in Rome on the 24th. Explorations are also underway on the issue of restoring diplomatic relations with some Arab countries. At the economic committee meeting of the Baghdad Pact, Britain actively proposed "aid" plans to counter the "aid" proposed by the United States.

In Africa, Britain is turning Kenya into a powerful base to replace the former base in the Suez Canal area, in order to protect its interests in the Indian Ocean and the Persian Gulf, and to connect Britain itself with its colonies in Africa and Asia. According to the Associated Press, some countries with colonies in Africa are holding secret meetings to organize a so-called "Pan-African Defense Group." It is worth noting that this meeting excludes the United States, which claims to be the leader of the "free world." This is obviously something used to counter the so-called African defense group advocated by the United States.

On the issue of relaxing trade with China, Britain has also shown a tendency to go its own way regardless of U.S. opposition. Under pressure from Britain, France, Japan, and other countries, the United States had to agree to revise the "embargo" list against China. However, the United States only agreed to remove the list of items that Britain rarely exports, and for the items that Britain hopes to export, it wants to strengthen the "embargo" and also wants Britain to "embargo" these items to the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries. As a result, the negotiations in Paris are at a stalemate. In order to put pressure on the United States, British Minister of State for Trade Alan Noble has announced in the House of Commons that if an agreement cannot be reached quickly, Britain will "have to reconsider the entire situation."

The United States is Creating Tension in Asia

Recently, more and more people in the United States are calling for a change in the unrealistic China policy, advocating recognition of China and improvement of relations with China. The issue of allowing American journalists to visit China has put Dulles in an embarrassing situation that he cannot deal with. American industrialists and businessmen are also asking to reconsider trade issues with China. The U.S. government now has to make some gestures to ease this pressure from all sides. For example, the U.S. Senate has established a subcommittee to study the possibility of trade between the U.S. and China. The United States is encountering increasing difficulties in the "embargo" issue against China.

However, the United States is unwilling to see the situation in the Far East eased. If the United States' relations with China are improved, it will lose its excuse for creating tension in Asia. The United States' recent dispatch of missile units to Taiwan, its announcement that it will transport atomic weapons to South Korea, its organization of military exercises by the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, and its support of the Ngo Dinh Diem group's sabotage of the Geneva Accords are all intended to create tension in Asia.

However, the efforts of hundreds of millions of peace-loving people around the world and the development of contradictions within the imperialist bloc determine the trend towards relaxation in the international situation. This futile struggle by the United States can only isolate it further.

### 最近国际时局的发展趋向
顾思

专栏：两周时事述评

    最近国际时局的发展趋向
    顾思
    过去两个星期里面国际时局的发展，说明整个局势正在继续趋向缓和。这是以苏联为首的社会主义阵营和全世界许多爱好和平、反对战争的国家努力的结果。在这种局势下，美国显出非常尴尬的样子。它一方面仍然竭力继续制造紧张局势，阻挠局势的缓和，另一方面却又不能不在某些问题上做出一些缓和的姿态，企图以退为进，来控制局势的发展。
    美国在裁军谈判中进退两难
    国际局势的和缓，表现在裁军问题上出现的新局面。
    在伦敦举行的联合国裁军小组委员会，经过两个月的讨论之后，已经从5月17日起暂时休会，定于5月27日继续举行。这次休会，是为了使参加讨论的各国政府，能够有时间来研究苏联在4月30日提出的一项关于局部裁军措施的新建议。这项建议中的最重要的一点，就是苏联在国际监督问题上采取了新的步骤，建议在欧洲、亚洲和美洲东西双方的广大地区内进行空中摄影。苏联这个建议，使得美国从1955年以来一直主张的所谓“开放天空”计划，失掉了阻挠裁军问题达成协议的作用。因此，一直希望实现裁军的许多国家，以及北大西洋集团中的不少西欧国家，都非常高兴，认为达成裁军协议有了希望。
    苏联的建议使美国非常被动。如果用老一套的办法加以拒绝，美国不愿和缓国际局势的面目就要完全暴露。用美联社的话说，就是“可能在一些危险地区和中立地区使美国的政策名誉扫地”。如果同意了苏联的建议，国际局势就会进一步和缓下来，这又是美国所最不希望的。在这种进退两难的情况下，美国一面警告北大西洋集团国家不要对达成裁军协议的前景“无限乐观”，一面表示要“详细研究”苏联的建议。但是，苏联建议的诚意是如此明显，美国要完全加以否定是十分困难的。
    关于如何对付苏联的建议，在美国统治集团中出现了两种意见。一种意见以艾森豪威尔、史塔生和国务院为代表，他们认为干脆拒绝是不可能的，因为这将会加强北大西洋集团内部的离心倾向，使美国的欧洲政策完全失败。他们主张提出一个讨价还价的对案。
    另一种意见以参谋长联席会议主席雷德福为代表，他认为，即使是有达成裁军协议的可能的这样一种前景，都是十分危险的。因为这将使西欧国家对于装备美国的原子武器，更加采取观望的态度。所以，他要求采取“极谨慎的态度”。
    现在，美国国家安全委员会正在研究下一步怎么办。据路透社报道说，杜勒斯在参议院裁军小组委员会中说，继续讨论裁军协定固然有危险，但是停止讨论裁军协定也有危险。这相当清楚地说出了美国今天的处境。从美国方面透露的消息说，美国可能提出一个实行“小部分军备削减”和建立试验性的空中视察制度的“第一步”计划。但是美国将拒绝立即禁止原子武器和核武器。
    从这个消息可以看出，美国现在不能不做出一些缓和姿态来敷衍各国人民的要求，但是它并不想解决关键性的迫切问题——禁止大规模毁灭性武器的问题。可是，美国要想不解决这个问题，困难也越来越大了。据说，杜勒斯在参议院裁军小组委员会上说，停止裁军谈判有两个危险，一是“核武器在不久将来可能会散布得很广”，二是“军备费用肯定会增加”。杜勒斯讲的第一种“危险”，反映了美国对于它甚至在帝国主义阵营中都丧失了核武器的垄断权的恐惧。他讲的第二种“危险”，说明美国人民和西欧各国人民对于日益增加的军备费用的反对，已经到了不容忽视的程度。
    英国不甘心屈居于美国之下
    5月15日，英国在圣诞岛爆炸了它制造的第一颗氢弹。这就结束了美国在资本主义世界里的核武器的垄断权。美国对英国实行封锁原子情报，也没有能够挽救美国这个垄断地位的丧失。英国现在对美国有了更多的讨价还价的资本了。
    英国的氢弹试验，是在世界各国人民越来越强烈地要求停止试验氢弹、禁止使用原子武器和核武器的时候进行的。这个反对原子武器的运动，现在规模日益扩大。许多国家的著名科学家最近都先后发表声明，要求科学家们拒绝为制造核武器而工作。在英国和美国，许多宗教团体、国会议员、普通市民都参加了要求停止氢弹试验、禁止核武器的斗争。
    但是，英国政府却坚决不顾人民的反对，试验它的氢弹。据说英国硬要试验氢弹，是为恢复它的大国地位而作的努力的一部分。因此，从某种意义上来说，也是英国对美国实行抵抗的一种表现。无怪乎英国首相麦克米伦一再沾沾自喜地说，英国的氢弹试验，使它处于同美国和苏联“相等的地位”。
    从英国侵略埃及失败以后，美国已经毫不掩饰地以资本主义世界的领导者自居，嘲笑英国的没落，到处排挤英国。在中东，美国正在取英国而代之。在欧洲，美国正在建立美国—西德轴心，扶植西德，削弱英国在欧洲的影响和地位。在非洲，美国对于英国和其他欧洲国家的殖民地，表示了越来越大的兴趣，也在积极扩大美国的影响和势力。
    但是，英国并不甘心成为一个二等国。过去两个星期里面，有种种迹象表明，英国正在更多地不顾美国而独立行事，恢复自己的地位和影响。英国驻美大使卡西亚警告美国“不要像别人那样打错算盘，不把英国考虑在内”。这是很有意思的。
    在大国会谈的问题上，英国同美国有不同的意见。英国官方和舆论界对于苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁在上月给麦克米伦首相的信，表示了极大的兴趣。普遍的看法是麦克米伦应该争取同苏联领导人举行会谈。合众社在5月20日报道说，麦克米伦如果不能做到举行四大国首脑会谈，也将单独同苏联举行会谈。对于苏联在4月19日提出的关于中东问题的照会，英国同美国和法国存在着分歧。据路透社报道，英国倾向于愿同苏联会谈，以便改善英国同苏联和中东国家的关系，而美、法则表示反对。
    对于中东，英国已经明白表示它不愿意被美国完全挤出。它正在采取比较现实的态度，调整它同中东国家之间的关系。英国已经宣布按照埃及条件使用苏伊士运河。同埃及举行的关于经济问题的谈判，24日已在罗马开始。同一些阿拉伯国家恢复外交关系的问题，也正在进行试探。在巴格达条约集团的经济委员会会议上，英国积极提出“援助”计划，来对抗美国所提出的“援助”。
    在非洲，英国正在把怯尼亚变成一个强大的基地，代替从前在苏伊士运河区的基地，以保护它在印度洋和波斯湾的利益，联结英国本身和它在非洲、亚洲的殖民地。据美联社报道说，在非洲有殖民地的一些国家，正在举行秘密会议，组织所谓“泛非洲防御集团”。值得注意的是，这个会议排除了自命为“自由世界”的领导者的美国。这显然是用来同美国提倡的所谓非洲防御集团相对抗的东西。
    在放宽对华贸易的问题上，英国也表现了一种不顾美国反对而自行其是的趋向。美国在英、法、日本和其他国家的压力下面，不得不同意修改对中国的“禁运”货单。但是，美国只同意取消那些英国很少输出的物品的名单，而对于英国希望输出的物品，却要加强“禁运”，并且还要英国对苏联和东欧国家也“禁运”这些物品。结果，在巴黎进行的谈判陷于僵局。为了对美国施加压力，英国国务大臣艾伦·诺布耳已经在下院宣布，如果再不能迅速达成协议，英国将“不得不重新考虑整个情况了”。
    美国在亚洲制造紧张
    最近以来，在美国国内有越来越多的人要求改变不现实的对华政策，主张承认中国，改善同中国的关系。关于容许美国记者访华的问题，已经使杜勒斯处于无法招架的尴尬境地。美国工商业家也要求重新考虑同中国的贸易问题。美国政府现在不能不做出某些姿态，来和缓这种来自各方面的压力。例如，美国参议院已经成立一个小组委员会，来研究美国同中国之间的贸易的可能性。美国在对华“禁运”问题上正遭遇到越来越大的困难。
    但是美国是不愿意远东的局势和缓下来的。美国如果同中国的关系得到改善，将使它丧失在亚洲制造紧张局势的借口。美国最近把导弹部队派到台湾，宣布要把原子武器运进南朝鲜，组织东南亚集团的军事演习，支持吴庭艳集团破坏日内瓦协议，都是为了要在亚洲制造紧张局势。
    但是，全世界爱好和平的亿万人民的努力和帝国主义集团内部矛盾的发展，决定了国际局势的和缓趋向。美国的这种徒劳的挣扎，只能使它更加孤立。
