    A Treasure Trove of Stone Carving Art
    An Introduction to the Cliffside Sculptures of Baodingshan Dafowan, Dazu, Sichuan
              Pan Shaotang
    Sichuan Province boasts 124 sites featuring grottoes or cliffside sculptures, scattered across dozens of counties, making it the province with the most stone carvings in the country. Construction and carving continued for over a millennium, from the Northern and Southern Dynasties, Tang, Five Dynasties, Song, to the Ming and Qing dynasties. These sites are not only numerous but also possess significant cultural and artistic value. Some Taoist and Confucian sculptures are rare in other parts of the country. The forms and methods of expression demonstrate bold creativity. The majestic Leshan Giant Buddha, standing over 70 meters tall, is a rarity nationally and even worldwide. Its toes are over a meter long, yet the entire figure maintains accurate proportions and majestic, compassionate dynamics and expression. These ancient sculptural arts of Sichuan are truly an incomparably rich treasure trove.
    Now, I will provide a brief introduction to the carving art of Dafowan in Baoding District, Dazu County.
    Dazu County has over twenty grottoes or cliffside sculpture sites, among which Dafowan in Baoding District, located thirty-five li east of the city in the mountains, is a large “A” shaped valley. The cliff walls are approximately forty to fifty meters high, divided into the South, North, and East cliffs, stretching about a li in length. The mountain terrain is magnificent, the scenery is beautiful, and the surrounding area contains sacred sites such as Shengshou Temple, the Inverted Pagoda, and Weimo Peak. In the past, for a very long time, this was a famous Buddhist site in Sichuan.
    These Song Dynasty sculptures of high artistic value were created by a renowned monk, Zhao Zhifeng (1159-122?), who dedicated his life to collecting donations and mobilizing the masses to carve them. Judging by the scale, it would have taken tens of thousands of people and decades of work.
    This artistic masterpiece has long been buried in the remote mountains due to inconvenient transportation. As a result, it has rarely been mentioned in modern cultural relic and art history records. It was only around 1945, when Dazu County commissioned experts from Chongqing to conduct a brief survey for the purpose of compiling a county gazetteer, that it began to be known and gradually valued.
    The sculpture art of Dafowan, while all based on Buddhist scriptures, was not constrained by "canonical rules" in terms of modeling, clothing, story plots, and layout. In its expression of religious content, it reflects the lives of the local people of the time more concretely, authentically, and deeply than sculptures in any other location.
    For example, the "Herding Oxen Picture" on the left side of the South Cliff entrance was originally intended to express the ten stages of suppressing and cultivating so-called "right thought" and "wrong thought" through ten oxen and ten herdsmen. It compares the herdsmen to "right thought" and the oxen to "wrong thought," with each herdsman holding a whip and leading the ox with a rope, representing the control of "wrong thought." However, when we look at the images carved into the mountainside, they are no longer a rigid propaganda of doctrine but vivid works of art. The layout is so harmonious: some oxen are lying down; some are leisurely licking their hooves; some seem to have encountered a beast and are about to break free; some are bowing their heads to drink wildly from a spring; and others are raising their heads to eat tender leaves. Some of the herdsmen are sleeping shirtless and carefree in the sun; some are sitting side by side with their arms around each other's shoulders, laughing heartily for some unknown reason. These vivid and lifelike images, the unique folk flavor, the lyrical artistic rhythm, interestingly tell us about the ancient herding life and the pleasant pastoral atmosphere.
    Another group, the "Sutra of the Parents' Great Kindness," is a series of high reliefs depicting family life, from a young couple praying for a child before the Buddha to pregnancy, childbirth, raising children, playing, and scenes of separation, labor, and quarrels between husband and wife. These are all portrayed very realistically. Although it depicts family life from a thousand years ago, it still feels very familiar today, and is therefore extremely popular with the local people.
    In addition, these sculptures are permeated with praise for labor and the beautiful aspirations of the people, or with sympathy for the suffering of the people. In the largest "Hell Transformation" sculpture group on the North Cliff, there are many such examples. For instance, the "Drinking Scene" was originally intended to illustrate the harm of drinking, depicting the confusion and alienation that arises within a family after drinking. However, judging from the actual expressions and relationships of the characters, the impression it gives is not one of negativity but is full of human emotion and fun. Another example is the beautiful and moving high relief "Girl Raising Chickens," which depicts a young girl, squinting her eyes and revealing a slight smile, bending over to open the semi-circular chicken coop. Some of the chickens have already come out, while others are just poking their heads out. The overall atmosphere of the composition gives the feeling that the girl is pleased and happy with her labor. The artist of this sculpture did not express the doctrine of opposing raising chickens for slaughter, which would lead to "hell," but instead expressed praise for working life. This is another example of why these artworks are so valuable.
    The diversity and originality in the expressive methods and techniques of these artworks are also worth mentioning. For example, on the East Cliff (i.e., the top of the bay), there is a reclining half-bodied Buddha "Nirvana" statue, about six zhang long, with its right shoulder, right arm, and lower body appearing to be buried in the stone mountain and not fully carved. Why carve only a half-body instead of a full-body here? After much consideration, I believe there is a reason for this treatment: First, if a full-bodied Buddha statue six zhang long were carved on this not-so-wide top, the feeling of its majestic physique would be weakened, and the entire Buddha Bay would appear top-heavy and bottom-light. Second, because the unexposed part is cleverly combined with the exposed part, it gives people an impression of extension that does not actually exist but is felt, and does not lose the integrity and unity of the entire artistic structure simply because it is only a half-body. This expressive method that adapts to local conditions is original. Other places, such as the "Repaying Kindness Sutra" and the "Nine Grades of Rebirth," also use this method of treatment.
    There are also many examples of the diversity of expressive techniques: For example, the muscles, dynamics, and expressions of the two semi-nude sinners in the "Frozen Hell" are carved using extremely high artistic skills according to the requirements of this theme. They are squatting on blocks of ice, their jaws clenched, with a cold torrent rushing behind them. One of them is wearing a torn coat, which further increases the feeling of cold. It makes people think that they are having "chills." This expressive skill cannot but be said to be superb.
    By comparing the "Round Enlightenment Cave" and the "Ten Heavenly Kings" sculpture groups, we can see how the artisans used different artistic styles when expressing the same subject matter under different circumstances. The "Twelve Round Enlightenments" gives people a feeling of stability, solemnity, gentleness, and magnificence, while the "Ten Great Kings," transformed from Bodhisattvas, gives a feeling of boldness and excitement. There are also obvious differences in the carving techniques, such as meticulousness versus boldness, lightness versus heaviness.
    The approximately twenty groups of grottoes and cliffside sculptures in Dafowan have almost no repetition in terms of subject matter, which is not the case in large-scale sculpture areas such as Yungang and Longmen. And the content of these stone carving arts is organically linked between each group. For example, to the right of the "Nirvana" image, which expresses the Buddha's "death," is the "Nine Dragons Bathing the Infant Buddha" sacred site, which expresses the Buddha's birth; the "Nine Grades of Rebirth," which symbolizes the beautiful "heaven," is next to the cruel "Hell Transformation"; the "Sutra of the Parents' Great Kindness," which expresses the kindness of parents, is juxtaposed with the "Repaying Kindness Sutra," which expresses the repaying of parents' kindness, and so on.
    At the same time, the carving of these sculptures was very planned in terms of the appropriate use of natural conditions. For example, the "Nine Dragons Bathing the Infant Buddha" utilizes naturally flowing spring water, while the "Round Enlightenment Cave" cleverly utilizes the light shining in from the top; the South Cliff wall is short and steeper, so the long but not high "Herding Oxen Picture" was carved; the North Cliff's surface is deep and has a slope, so larger-scale mural-style sculpture groups such as the "Hell Transformation" and "Nine Grades of Rebirth" were carved. This appropriate and clever use of natural conditions is still a great inspiration for our current sculpture work.
    There are many other characteristics of the stone carvings in Dafowan, such as the popular explanations of the scriptural stone carvings, the Bodhisattva statues kneeling with their backs facing the viewer, the round back niches, the strange light emanating from the mouth, and the localization of the Buddha's face, etc. Due to space limitations, I will not describe them one by one here.
    The stone carvings of Dafowan should not only be compared with Yungang, Longmen, Dunhuang, and other places in China, but they can also be compared without shame with the world-famous Greek Parthenon and the Indian Ajanta Caves.

    石刻艺术的宝库
    介绍四川大足宝顶大佛湾的摩崖造像
              潘绍棠
    四川省，有石窟或摩崖造像一百二十四处，分布在几十个县里，是全国石刻造像最多的省份。从南北朝、唐、五代、宋以至明、清，延续修建或开凿了达千年以上，不但数量多而且有重要的文物和艺术价值，有些道教和儒教造像，在全国其它地区是少见的。表现形式和方法有大胆的创造。雄伟巨大的乐山石佛，高七十余公尺，为全国以至全世界所罕见，它的脚趾一丈多长，而全身仍有正确的比例和雄伟与慈祥的动态、表情。四川的这些古代雕刻艺术，确是丰富无比的宝库。
    现在仅就大足县宝顶区大佛湾的雕刻艺术作简要的介绍。
    大足县有二十余处石窟或摩崖造像，其中宝顶区大佛湾，在城东三十五里的丛山中，是座形似“A”字的大山沟。崖壁高约四、五十公尺，分南、北、东三岩，长约里许，山势雄伟，风景优美，周围有圣寿寺、倒塔、维摩顶等圣迹。过去在一段很长的年代里，这里是四川佛教胜地。
    这些有很高艺术价值的宋代造像是一位著名僧人赵智凤（公元1159—122？）以他毕生化缘捐募来的钱动员群众开凿的。根据规模来看，当时如没有几万的人力和数十年的功夫是做不到的。
    这一艺术巨制，由于长期以来一直被埋没在交通不便的重山峻岭中，因此在近代文物和美术史记载中很少提到，只是在1945年间，大足县为了修县志才从重庆请去了一批专家，进行了为期很短的调查后，才开始被人们知道和逐渐重视起来。
    大佛湾的雕刻艺术，所有造像，虽然都根据佛教经义，但不论在造型上、衣饰上、故事情节上和布局上，都没有受“仪轨”的局限。它在表现宗教内容的时候，比其它任何地方的造像都更加具体，真实和深入地反映了当时当地的人民生活。
    例如南岩入口左侧的“牧牛图”，原意是通过十条牛和十个牧人来表现所谓“正念”和“错念”抑制修养的十个过程的，它把牧人比做“正念”，把牛比作“错念”，每个牧人都持有鞭子，并且用缰绳牵着牛，表示操纵着“错念”；但我们看依着山势刻凿出来的那些形象，却已经不是教义的生硬的宣传，而是非常生动的艺术品了，看它的布局是多么协调：有的牛儿卧着；有的闲散地舐着自己的蹄子；有的好像遇到了猛兽正要脱缰而逃；有的在俯首狂饮泉水；也有的在仰头卷食嫩叶；牧牛人有的在阳光下袒胸裸腹、无忧无虑地睡着；有的钩肩搭背，并排而坐，不知因为什么，引起了他们的捧腹大笑。这些生动逼真的形象，别致的民间情调，抒情诗般的艺术节奏，有趣地告诉了我们古代的放牧生活以及那康乐的田园风趣。
    另一组“父母恩重经”，是反映家庭生活的一组连环画式的高雕，从一对青年夫妇在佛前求子到怀孕、临产、养育、玩耍，以及夫妻间的离别、劳动、口角等等情景，都刻划得很逼真。这虽是千年前的家庭生活，但现在看来，仍感到十分亲切，所以极受当地群众的喜爱。
    另外这些雕刻还渗透着对劳动和人民美好愿望的歌颂，或对人民的苦难给予同情。在北岩一幅最大的“地狱变相”雕刻群中，就有许多这样的例子。如“饮酒图”，原意本在于说明饮酒之害，描写一家人饮酒之后产生了互不相识的混乱情形。但从这些人物的实际表情和关系去看，给人们的印象，不是否定，而是充满了人情和乐趣。再如优美动人的高雕“养鸡女”，描述一位少女，迷细着眼睛，流露出微微的笑容，弓身打开半圆形的鸡笼，鸡儿有的已经出笼，有的正在露出头来。整个构图的气氛，给人的感觉是少女为自己的劳动感到欣慰和愉快。这一雕刻的作者，不去表现原意是反对饲鸡宰食，否则会入“地狱”的教义的宣传，而表现了对劳动生活的歌颂，这就是这些艺术品的所以可贵之又一例子。
    这些艺术品的表现方法和技巧上的丰富多样与独创精神，也是值得提出的。例如湾的东岩（即湾顶），是一座横卧的长达六丈左右的半身佛“涅槃”像，右肩右臂和下身好像都埋在石山中而并未刻出。为什么在这儿刻半身而不刻全身呢？我再三思索，觉得它这样处理是有道理的：第一，如果在这样并不宽的顶端，刻上全身长六丈的佛像，在体魄的雄伟感上一定要减弱，同时也就要显得整个佛湾头轻下重了。第二，由于未露出部分与露出部分结合得很巧妙，因此给人一种实际上不存在而在感觉上却存在的延伸的印象，并不因为只有半身而失去整个艺术结构的完整和统一。这种因地制宜的表现方法是有独创性的。其它在“报恩经”和“九品往生图”中，有的地方也采用这种处理的方法。
    在表现技巧的多样性方面也有很多例子：例如“寒冰地狱”中的两位半裸体的罪人，其肌肉、动态和表情的刻划，都是根据这一主题的要求运用了极高的艺术技巧。他俩缩紧身子蹲在冰块上，牙关紧闭，背后冲击着寒冷的激流，其中一人穿着一件破绽的上衣，这样就更增加了冰冷的感觉，看去使人联想到他俩正在打“寒战”似的，这种表现技巧不能不说是高超的吧。
    再拿“圆觉洞”和“十天明王”这两组雕刻群来做比较，就可看出艺术匠师们在表现不同情况下的同一题材时是如何运用了不同的艺术格调。 “十二圆觉”给人以安定、肃穆、温柔、富丽的感觉，而由菩萨化身的“十大明王”的感觉则是给人豪放、激动。在雕刻技法上也有着细致与豪放、轻匀与厚重等明显的不同。
    大佛湾共约二十组的石窟和摩崖造像，在题材内容方面几乎没有什么重复，这在云岗、龙门等地的大规模造像区中是没有的。而这些石刻艺术，在每组之间，其内容都是有机的联系着。如表现佛的“死”的“涅槃”像的右边，便是表现佛降生的“九龙洛太子”圣迹；象征美好“天堂”的“九品往生图”，其右侧便是残酷的“地狱变相”；表现父母恩情的“父母恩重经”，和表现报答父母的“报恩经”，左右并列等等。
    同时，这些造像的开凿，对自然条件的恰当利用，也是很有计划的。如“九龙洛太子”就利用了自然流下的泉水，“圆觉洞”内则巧妙地利用了顶上射进的光线；南岩崖壁短而较陡便刻了长而不高的“牧牛图”；北岩的崖面深而有斜坡，便刻了幅面较大的“地狱变相”和“九品往生图”等壁画式的雕刻群。这样恰当和巧妙地利用自然条件，对于我们今天的雕刻工作，仍有很大的启发。
    大佛湾的石刻，还有不少特点，如通俗的经义石刻说明辞，背向跪着的菩萨像，圆的背龛，奇异的从口中引出的豪光，佛面型的地方化等等，因限于篇幅这里就不一一叙述了。
    大佛湾的石刻，不但应与国内的云岗、龙门、敦煌等地相提并论，即与世界著名的希腊巴农特神殿和印度阿旃陀石窟相比，也并无愧色。
