    Beijing, May 27th - After three and a half days of divisional meetings, the Second Plenary Session of the Academic Divisions of the Chinese Academy of Sciences entered the stage of general speeches on the morning of the 27th.

    Yan Jici delivered a report at yesterday morning's meeting on the "Work of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Delegation to the Soviet Union." He said that the Chinese Academy of Sciences dispatched a delegation to the Soviet Union at the end of 1956. The purpose of the visit was to understand and learn about the research work and experience of the Soviet Union in seven aspects: titanium metallurgy, semiconductors, automation, electronics, electrical engineering, machinery, and power. This would help the preparation of research institutes in these areas in China and the development of recent specific research work. Based on the experience of this visit, six specific suggestions were put forward for the development of scientific research in China.

    Qian Xuesen's speech at the meeting was entitled "On Technical Science."

    Qian Sanqiang gave a report on "Participating in the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research."

    At the afternoon meeting, nine people, including agronomist Chen Fengtong, spoke. Philosopher Tang Yongtong, zoologist Bing Zhi, agronomist Ding Ying, microbiologist Fang Xinfang, and civil engineer Mao Yisheng made written statements.

    Academician Bing Zhi, a zoologist, put forward three suggestions in his speech: First, the national scientific research network should be improved and strengthened. The Academy of Sciences should strengthen cooperation with the Ministry of Higher Education and industrial departments and work together instead of acting independently. Second, a sound scientific library should be built. Efforts should be made to collect scientific literature from all over the world in Beijing, so that the completeness of the books is equal to that of the scientific libraries of the world's advanced scientific countries. Third, the problem of scientific equipment should be solved. Ways should be found to manufacture the equipment needed for scientific research as soon as possible.

    Academician Chen Fengtong, an agronomist, spoke on how to implement the "Letting a hundred flowers bloom" policy in academic circles. He said: "Recently, there is a so-called method of labeling, as if a school of thought can be formed in one morning." He believes that the establishment of a school of thought cannot be so easy, and we should honestly carry out research work and present real evidence in academic debates. Empty talk and useless arguments will not benefit the future of academia. He emphasized that after a long period of ideological struggle, materialism and idealism have proven with countless facts that only materialism is the truth. Therefore, he said, "We must not assume" that only when one is a materialist and the other is an idealist can there be contention, opening a Michurin training class on one side and a Morgan training class on the other, singing a rival show. There can be no contention in a single play. We think this is absolutely impossible. Since the policy of "Letting a hundred flowers bloom" was put forward, a lively atmosphere has appeared in China's scientific circles, and the criticism of dogmatism and isolationism in past academic thoughts, especially the bureaucracy and some rude behaviors in scientific leadership, has begun. He believes this is completely necessary and correct. He said: "However, some bad situations have also emerged, which should attract everyone's attention. For example, projects that were originally collaborative research are now no longer collaborative, believing that only by doing their own work can they write a sensational paper; research projects that were originally combined with production are now abandoned, believing that they are too backward to catch up with the world's advanced level. This is more obvious in agricultural science. Everyone is breeding, hybrid breeding, and distant hybridization breeding in a rush, and they don't like to engage in work such as cultivation and field selection, believing that only breeding can establish a school of thought. We believe that this is a method of separating from the masses and separating from reality."

    Academician Ding Ying, an agronomist, believes in his written statement that the connection between agricultural scientific theory and practice has been insufficient in recent years, the rich heritage created by predecessors has not been well accepted, and the foundation of the most fundamental research activities has not been solid. Therefore, he believes that at this time, putting our "main force" into developing new scientific fields, exploring new directions, and finding new roads should be considered.

    Fang Xinfang, a microbiologist, hopes in his written statement that the Academic Divisions will contact the masses more, and the personnel of the Academic Divisions should constantly go down to the institutes and departments to understand the situation and listen to the opinions of the masses.

    Ge Tingsui, a metal physicist, made a speech on correctly understanding and handling some contradictory problems in the march towards science. He believes that the purpose of marching towards science should be clarified, conscientious and hard work should be done in a down-to-earth manner, and the Party's mass line in scientific work should be implemented, political study should be strengthened, and ideological transformation should be continued, so that dialectical materialism can be applied to specific work, and the motherland's scientific cause can be promoted to catch up with the international level in twelve years.

    Gong Zuting, an optician, gave a speech entitled "The Walls Inside and Outside the Academy Must Be Torn Down," saying: People outside the Academy of Sciences reflect that the gate of the Academy of Sciences is very small and there is some isolation or monopolistic thinking. On the other hand, the unequal distribution of work and leisure and unequal treatment inside and outside the Academy are worth checking by our comrades in the Academy. There seem to be walls between the various Academic Divisions in the Academy, and the walls in the middle also need to be torn down.

    Geologists Meng Xianmin, Xie Jarong, and Zhang Wenyou successively made speeches on issues such as geological surveying and geological scientific research work. Xie Jarong said that at present, the geological research institutions of the Ministry of Geology and the Academy of Sciences only make sections without surveying and mapping geological maps in geological surveying work, which is not a good method, and it is also inappropriate for the Ministry of Geology to hand over the task of geological surveying to the provincial bureaus or to have a large number of young graduates handle it according to specifications. He also pointed out that the phenomenon of waste in geological exploration work is very serious, and suggested that the geological department conduct an inspection of the various exploration work since liberation. Zhang Wenyou believes that geological survey and geological scientific research work have not been developed as they should be, lagging far behind the actual needs, and there is a trend of no successors. There are also problems of insufficient contact, lack of cooperation, and division of labor in the geological science community itself. Meng Xianmin criticized some problems in the leadership work of the Academy of Sciences and pointed out that the scientific planning meeting last year and the scientific research coordination meeting this year were tight at the beginning and loose at the end, and there was no follow-up after the meeting.

    Xia Jianbai and Fang Jun, surveyors, jointly expressed their opinions on the fact that the scientific and technological work of surveying and mapping has not been well carried out so far. They believe that the main reason is that the coordination work has not been done well.

    Academician Mao Yisheng, a civil engineer, put forward some specific suggestions on the organization and system of scientific research work.

    科学院学部委员会全体会议开始大会发言
    本报讯　中国科学院学部委员会第二次全体会议，经过三天半的分学部会议以后，于27日上午进入大会发言阶段。
    严济慈在昨天上午的大会上作了“中国科学院赴苏考察团工作”的报告。他说，中国科学院于1956年年底派遣了赴苏考察团。考察的目的是了解与学习苏联关于钛冶金、半导体、自动化、电子学、电工、机械、动力等七方面的研究工作情况与经验。以便有助于我国这几方面研究所的筹建和最近具体研究工作的开展。并根据这次考察的体会，给我国发展科学研究工作提出了六项具体的建议。
    钱学森在大会上的发言题目是“论技术科学”。
    钱三强作了“关于参加联合原子核研究所”的报告。
    在下午的会议上，发言的有农学家陈凤桐等九人，哲学家汤用彤、动物学家秉志、农学家丁颖、微生物学家方心芳、土木工程学家茅以升等作了书面发言。
    动物学家秉志委员在发言中提出三点意见：首先，要健全与加强全国的科学研究网。科学院应与高教部、产业部门加强合作、打成一片，不可各自为政。其次，要建设一健全的科学图书馆。尽量收集全世界的科学文献集中于北京，使图书之完备，与世界科学先进国的科学图书馆相等。第三，要解决科学器材问题。科学研究所需之器材，应早日设法自造。
    农学家陈凤桐委员就学术界如何贯彻百家争鸣方针发言说：“近来有所谓贴标签的办法，好像一个早晨就可以成为一个学派。”他认为，学派的成立，不能那样容易，还是应该老老实实地进行研究工作，在学术争论中拿出真凭实据来，清谈、空抬扛，对学术前途不会有好处。他强调说，唯物主义和唯心主义经过长时期的思想斗争，已经用无数的事实证明，只有唯物主义才是真理。所以他说，“决不能这样设想”必须一个是唯物主义者，一个是唯心主义者，才能争鸣起来，一边开米丘林训练班，一边开摩尔根训练班，唱对台戏。一台戏里就不能争鸣。我们认为绝不能这样。百家争鸣的方针提出以后，我国科学界出现了活跃的气象，开始批判过去学术思想上的教条主义和关门主义，特别是科学领导上的官僚主义和某些粗暴行为。他认为这是完全必要的，对的。他说：“但也出现了一些不好的情况，应该引起大家注意。例如原来合作研究的项目，现在不合作了，认为只有各干各的，才能写出一鸣惊人的论文；原来结合生产的研究项目，现在放弃了，认为那太落后，赶不上世界先进水平。这在农业科学界表现的更明显。大家一阵风地搞育种、杂交育种、远缘杂交育种，不喜欢搞栽培和田间选种一类的工作，认为只有育种才能建立起学派。我们认为，这是脱离群众、脱离实际的办法。”
    农学家丁颖委员在书面发言中认为，几年来农业科学理论联系实际很不够，对于前人创造的丰富遗产未很好接受，最根本的研究活动基础还未坚稳。因此他认为，在这个时候就把我们的“主力”放到发展新的科学领域上去，放到探索新的方向和找寻新的道路上去，是应该考虑的。
    微生物学家方心芳在书面发言中希望学部多联系群众，学部的人员要不断下所、室了解情况，多听听群众的意见。
    金属物理学家葛庭燧就正确认识和处理向科学进军中的一些矛盾问题作了发言。他认为，应该明确向科学进军的目的性，实事求是地刻苦钻研，并且贯彻党在科学工作中的群众路线、加强政治学习，继续进行思想改造，把辩证唯物主义运用到具体工作中去，才能推动祖国的科学事业，在十二年内赶上国际水平。
    光学家龚祖同以要把院内外的墙壁拆掉为题发言说：科学院外人士反映，科学院对外大门开得很小，有些闭关自守或独占思想，另一方面院内院外的劳逸不均、待遇不平，这值得我们院内同志检查一下，要把对外的墙壁拆掉。在院内各学部间也好像有墙壁似的，这中间的墙壁也需要拆掉。
    地质学家孟宪民、谢家荣、张文佑先后就地质测量和地质科学研究工作等方面的问题作了发言。谢家荣说，目前地质部和科学院的地质研究机构，对地质测量工作只做剖面而不测制地质图，这不是很好的办法，而地质部把地质测量任务交给省局或由大批青年毕业生按照规范办事也是不妥当的。他还指出地质勘探工作中浪费现象十分严重，建议地质部门对解放以来的各项勘探工作进行一次检查。张文佑认为，地质普查和地质科学研究工作没有得到应有的发展，远远落后于实际的需要，并有后继无人之势。地质科学界本身也存在着联系不够、缺乏合作与分工的问题。孟宪民批评科学院院部领导工作中的一些问题，并指出去年的科学规划会议和今年的科学研究协调会议，前紧后松，会后无有下文。
    测量学家夏坚白、方俊在联合发言中对测量制图的科学技术工作至今没有很好开展提出意见，他们认为主要原因是协调工作没有作好。
    土木工程学家茅以升委员就科学研究工作的组织和体制问题提出了一些具体建议。
