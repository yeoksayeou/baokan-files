    Disarmament Subcommittee Resumes Meeting
    Stassen Says He Will Take a Serious Attitude
    Xinhua News Agency, London, 28th: The United Nations Disarmament Commission Subcommittee resumed its meeting in London on the 27th. According to Western news agencies, U.S. representative Stassen said at the meeting that the United States is willing to reach an agreement on a partial disarmament agreement.
    Stassen said the United States understands that many difficult problems remain to be solved regarding on which issues compromises should be made. However, the United States is currently "seriously" seeking a plan acceptable to all countries.
    He said that the current purpose of the United States is to conclude a limited treaty to decide on the initial steps towards disarmament.
    Stassen did not formally propose the U.S. disarmament plan, reportedly because the plan is being studied by some U.S. "allies."
    Soviet representative Zorin said in his speech that although he did not know the content of the U.S. plan, he welcomed Stassen's assurance that he would take a serious attitude.
    Canadian representative Johnson praised the speeches of Stassen and Zorin, considering them "encouraging."
    The next meeting of the subcommittee will be held on the 28th.

    裁军小组委员会复会
    史塔生表示将采取认真态度
    据新华社28日讯　伦敦消息：联合国裁军委员会小组委员会27日在伦敦复会。据西方通讯社透露，美国代表史塔生在会上说，美国愿意就局部裁军协定达成协议。
    史塔生说，美国了解，关于应该在那些问题上妥协，仍然有许多难题需要解决。但是，美国目前正在“认真地”寻求一项使一切国家都可以接受的计划。
    他说，美国当前的目的在于缔结一项有限度的条约，决定走向裁军的初步步骤。
    史塔生没有正式提出美国的裁军计划，据说这是因为这个计划正在由美国的一些“盟国”研究中。
    苏联代表佐林在发言中说，他虽然不知道美国计划的内容如何，但是他对史塔生所提出的要采取认真态度的那种保证表示欢迎。
    加拿大代表约翰逊称赞史塔生和佐林的发言，认为这种发言是“令人鼓舞的”。
    小组委员会下次会议在28日举行。
