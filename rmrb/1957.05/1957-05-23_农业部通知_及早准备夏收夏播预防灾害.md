Ministry of Agriculture Notice
Prepare Early for Summer Harvest and Planting, Prevent Disasters

    (Based on a report from this newspaper) The Ministry of Agriculture issued a "Notice on Doing a Good Job in Preparing for Summer Harvest and Planting and Preventing Disaster Attacks" on the 22nd of this month.

    The notice said: The season for summer harvest and planting is approaching. In order to achieve high yields and bumper harvests and timely planting, all localities must learn from the lessons of disaster-related production reductions during last year's wheat harvest period, prevent possible disasters, and make preparations for summer harvest and planting as early as possible.

    The notice then pointed out: This year's wheat acreage is larger than last year, and the maturity period is also relatively concentrated. In addition, it is also a tense time for weeding and pest control, which makes the summer harvest and planting work even tighter. Therefore, all localities must:

    1. Ensure timely harvesting, timely sowing, and transplanting. The time for harvesting wheat should not be forced to be uniform. Agricultural cooperatives and production teams should classify different varieties, soil types, and plots according to their maturity, arrange them in order, and determine a short-term plan for summer harvest and planting to harvest and sow in a timely manner. In the event of climate change, the plan should be flexibly adjusted to ensure timely harvesting and planting.

    2. During the summer harvest and planting period, agricultural cooperatives should fully mobilize and organize full and semi-laborers to first complete the summer harvest and planting tasks. Other farm work, except for very urgent tasks, can be postponed.

    3. Tools and sites required for summer harvesting, such as harvesting, transporting, threshing, and storage, as well as on-site rain and fire prevention equipment, must be prepared in advance to ensure immediate harvesting, transportation, threshing, and distribution, and organize commune members to watch the fields and patrol the fields to avoid accidental losses. At the same time, attention should be paid to careful harvesting and threshing, and auxiliary labor should be organized to collect wheat, so that every grain returns home.

    4. During the summer harvest, agricultural cooperatives should, according to their own conditions, adopt methods of ear selection or piece selection to do a good job in selecting and retaining fine varieties. In order to further expand the area of fine varieties, agricultural bureaus (sections) in each county should thoroughly understand the selection and retention of seeds by agricultural cooperatives and plan the adjustment of fine varieties needed for autumn planting as soon as possible. Agricultural cooperatives should also establish seed retention plots according to their own needs to continuously improve seed quality.

    The notice finally said: From now until August and September, it is the period when natural disasters such as drought, flood, wind, hail, and insects are most likely to occur. The agricultural departments of all provinces should, based on past experience and referring to this year's climate forecast, fully estimate all possible disasters and vigorously prevent them.

    农业部通知
    及早准备夏收夏播预防灾害
    本报讯　农业部于本月22日发出“关于做好夏收夏播准备工作预防灾害侵袭”的通知。
    通知说：夏收夏播季节已经临近。为了做到丰产丰收，适时播种，各地必须吸取去年麦收时期受灾减产的教训，预防可能发生的灾害，及早做好夏收夏播的准备工作。
    通知接着指出：今年小麦面积比去年扩大，成熟期也比较集中，再加又值锄苗、治虫的紧张时机，这就使得夏收夏播工作挤得更紧。为此，各地必须：
    一、保证做到适时收割，适时下种和插秧。割麦时间不能强求一律，应由各个农业合作社和生产队根据不同的品种、土质、地块，按其成熟先后分类排队，定出夏收夏种的小段计划，依次收割，适时播种。遇到气候变化，还要灵活地调整计划，保证做到收种及时。
    二、在夏收夏种期间，农业社要充分动员和组织整、半劳力，首先完成夏收夏播任务，其他农活除十分紧急的以外，可推迟一步去做。
    三、收割、运送、打场、储藏等夏收工作所需的工具和场所，以及场间防雨防火设备，都必须事先准备好，以便做到随割、随运、随打、随分，并且组织社员看场、巡田，避免意外损失。同时，要注意精收细打，并组织辅助劳力拾麦，做到颗粒还家。
    四、在夏收中，农业社应该根据本社的条件，分别采取穗选或片选的办法，做好良种选留工作。为进一步扩大良种面积，各县农业局（科）应深入了解农业社选种留种情况，及早筹划秋种所需良种的调剂工作。农业社也应根据本社的需要建立留种地，不断提高种子质量。
    通知最后说：从现在起，到8、9月间，是旱、涝、风、雹、虫等自然灾害最易发生的时期，各省农业厅应该根据历年经验，参照今年的气候预报，对一切可能发生的灾害给以充分估计，大力加以预防。
