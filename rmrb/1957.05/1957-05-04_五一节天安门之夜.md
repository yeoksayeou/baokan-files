    May Day Night at Tiananmen
    Guo Moruo
    Underneath Tiananmen, the crowds are like a sea, atop Tiananmen, the cherished friends are like clouds. Guests from over forty countries are all talking and laughing cheerfully. Look, the peacock is displaying its tail, a group of butterflies are frolicking with the stars. The light of the colorful searchlights weaves a brocade in the air.
    Someone says: The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl will be greatly surprised at the edge of the Milky Way, feeling that their celestial agriculture should also be collectivized.
    Someone says: Chang'e in the Moon Palace must feel boundless longing, thinking of coming here to do the Yangko dance, and forming groups with the young comrades.
    Someone says: The Old Man of the South Pole's birthday star is fidgeting in the sky, preparing to cut off his beard with scissors and come to Tiananmen to celebrate youth.
    Someone also says: The movie stars of the United States, those executors of the Cold War policy, will feel a shiver all over here, shaking awake their war dreams.
    Guests from over forty countries are all talking and laughing cheerfully, appreciating the peaceful use of gunpowder, making people rejoice until dawn.

    五一节天安门之夜
    郭沫若天安门下人群如海，天安门上胜友如云。来自四十几国的嘉宾一个个都在谈笑风生。你看呵，孔雀在开屏，一群蝴蝶在闹着星星。五彩的探照灯的光在半空中织成了云锦。有人说：那牛郎和织女在天河边上会大吃一惊，感觉到他们天上的农业也应该合作化才行。有人说：月宫里的嫦娥一定感受到无边的憧憬，想到这儿来扭一扭秧歌，和年青的同志们结队成群。有人说：南极老人的寿星在天边也弄得坐立不定，正准备一剪子剪下胡子，来到天安门欢度青春。也有人说：花旗国的明星，那些冷战政策的执行人，到这儿会发出浑身冷战，把他们战争的狂梦抖醒。来自四十几国的嘉宾一个个都在谈笑风生。欣赏着火药的和平利用，使人们欢乐着直到天明。
