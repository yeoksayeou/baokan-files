Democratic Party Leaders Criticize Communist Party Members' Sectarianism at Symposium Convened by United Front Work Department

    This newspaper reports that the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a symposium with responsible persons from various democratic parties and non-party democratic figures, which continued on the afternoon of the 9th. Those who spoke at the meeting included Hu Ziang, Vice Chairman of the China Democratic National Construction Association, Chen Qiyou, Chairman of the Zhi Gong Party, Wang Kunlun, Standing Committee Member of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, Huang Qixiang, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, Tan Zhiqing, Deputy Secretary-General of the China Democratic National Construction Association, and Min Ganghou, Standing Committee Member of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League.

    There Should Be No "Wall" Between Party and Non-Party Members

    Hu Ziang said: Under the current situation, the relationship between the Party and the democratic parties needs to be closer, but in reality, it is not close but relatively distant. For example, after the policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision was put forward, the Party did not jointly study with the democratic parties a set of specific measures on how to conduct mutual supervision. Some places originally provided varying degrees of support and assistance to the local organizations of the democratic parties, but now they ignore them altogether. Hu Ziang suggested establishing a set of methods and measures regarding work relations and working methods from the perspective of organizational connection. Regarding the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," Hu Ziang said: Some people in the industrial and commercial sectors believe that they are reformed elements, harbor a sense of class inferiority, and fear that what is "let go" and "contended" will not be valued; still others suspect that "letting go" and "contending" and "rectification" are a three-part process, with the danger of being rectified after "letting go" and "contending"; some comrades said: We don't have no opinions on some policies. There are many things that the industrial and commercial sectors can "let go" and "contend," but some people say that policies cannot be contended, and others say that policies can be contended, but not publicly.

    Hu Ziang also analyzed the contradictions within the China Democratic National Construction Association, more specifically, the issue of the assessment of the current industrial and commercial sectors within the China Democratic National Construction Association. He said: Judging from the information reflected from various sources, there are currently two different ideas and views on the industrial and commercial sectors. One view is that after the joint state-private ownership of enterprises, the economic foundation of the industrial and commercial sectors has undergone fundamental changes. Therefore, in joint state-private enterprises, there is only a relationship of cooperation, no class relationship, and no negative side to speak of. They believe that encouraging the industrial and commercial sectors is the way to unleash their enthusiasm. If we emphasize that they have two sides, it will increase their sense of inferiority and make them even more hesitant. The other view is that under the education and cultivation of the Party and the government over the past few years, the awareness of comrades in the industrial and commercial sectors has been continuously improving, and many of them have already possessed the spirit of "gladly accepting criticism." Therefore, encouraging their achievements and criticizing their shortcomings will not only not affect their enthusiasm, but on the contrary, can improve them and accelerate their transformation. Hu Ziang believes that these two different opinions should be made public for everyone to contend.

    Hu Ziang frankly criticized the sectarianism of Communist Party members, saying: Party-masses relations in many places are still distant, manifested as "respectful but not close, close but not intimate." Some people say that there seems to be a wall, a threshold, between the Party and non-Party members. Although this wall and this threshold may not be very thick or very high, they should not exist. Hu Ziang also gave an example: if several Party members are talking together, and a non-Party person comes in, the conversation will immediately stop. Non-Party people also have this situation with Party members. Some Party members have a serious "political face" that makes people respect them but stay away from them. Some people believe that the Party organizations of some enterprises are currently taking the lead in work and study and have a set of documents, which is good and allows Party members to have a clear idea in advance, but private leaders will be affected in their work. When talking about cadre issues, Hu Ziang said: The cadres of the China Democratic National Construction Association have a "three-no-one-cares" (government doesn't care, trade union doesn't care, United Front Work Department doesn't care) and "four-not-like" (not like democratic figures, not like the industrial and commercial sector, not like government cadres, not like the working class) mentality. He hopes that the United Front Work Department will help the China Democratic National Construction Association solve these problems.

    Let Zhi Gong Party Members Participate in More Activities

    Chen Qiyou said: During the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, some members of democratic parties in government agencies were arrested, but the democratic parties did not know at all, or if they knew, they were not clear about why they were arrested. A member of the Zhi Gong Party, working in the Academy of Sciences, was arrested. The Zhi Gong Party did not know about his arrest for several months. When they found out, they decided to expel him from the party, but soon he came out and resumed his work. As for why he was arrested and why he was released, the Zhi Gong Party did not know at all. Why don't you let the democratic parties know? Chen Qiyou believes: Is it because of distrust? Or is it because the democratic parties are regarded as an agency unrelated to its organizational members? But whatever the reason, it is inappropriate, because this is not a matter of secrecy, but a matter of whether or not to abide by the law. Chen Qiyou also proposed that the country's civil and criminal laws should be formulated and strictly followed as soon as possible.

    Chen Qiyou also believes that the Zhi Gong Party has very few opportunities to participate in activities at the Beijing municipal level. There are no representatives of the Zhi Gong Party in the Municipal People's Congress, no members of the Zhi Gong Party in the Municipal Political Consultative Conference, and no participation of the Zhi Gong Party in other political activities at the municipal level. It is said that this is because the Zhi Gong Party does not yet have a Beijing municipal-level organization. Chen Qiyou believes that not having a municipal-level organization does not mean that there is no work to be done, let alone that there is no need to participate in political activities.

    In order to receive overseas Chinese, Chen Qiyou believes that the Zhi Gong Party should be given a more decent house. Currently, the Zhi Gong Party's headquarters building is really not enough. The Zhi Gong Party's building was originally used by the Beijing Office with a staff of nine people. Now the central establishment has increased several times compared to the past, so you can imagine how insufficient it is. When talking about the issue of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision, Chen Qiyou suggested that the democratic parties should understand the relevant policies and guidelines and materials. Otherwise, there will be no standards for supervision and no standards for carrying out work. However, Chen Qiyou also believes that we are not asking to attend all meetings and obtain confidential national defense information, but that the democratic parties should be invited to participate in meetings related to our work.

    Hope That in This Rectification,

    The Democratic Parties Can Speak Boldly

    Wang Kunlun spoke on the issue of whether the various democratic parties and non-party democratic figures have played a role in the organs of state power. He cited the situation of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress as an example, pointing out three shortcomings in this regard. In his speech, he criticized the work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. He said that the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang comrades reflected that the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress understood the situation less; there were fewer concrete discussions; and there were fewer individual contacts. Because the Standing Committee members do not understand the national situation, the Standing Committee often discusses proposals temporarily, which makes discussion difficult.

    Some people say: Why do democratic parties always speak when major proposals are brought out for discussion, but Communist Party members do not speak? Is it because they have been discussed in advance and then told to us? Others believe that major national policies and guidelines are passed in one meeting, so speaking becomes a formality. Small meetings should be held first for discussion, and then the Standing Committee should discuss them. Regarding the issue of having authority with responsibility, Wang Kunlun believes that the democratic parties have positions and responsibilities but no authority in government agencies. Some people criticize the democratic parties for having the idea of being guests. He believes that a concrete analysis should be carried out to see if we are placed in the position of host. He hopes that in this rectification, the democratic parties can speak boldly and put forward all their opinions and boldly criticize the Communist Party. When talking about opinions on the United Front Work Department, Wang Kunlun said: It is true that the United Front Work Department only unites with the upper levels and not the lower levels, but some people also say, "Is the 'upper level' united enough?" The middle and lower levels are uneasy and willing to go to government agencies, not willing to do party work, mainly because the United Front Work Department does not pay attention to them. Therefore, he hopes that comrades in the United Front Work Department should have more contact with them. Wang Kunlun also raised the issue of housing difficulties.

    Treat the Democratic Parties Like Brothers

    The next speaker was Huang Qixiang, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party. In his speech, he first expressed his agreement with many of the speeches already made at the symposium. He hopes that such a symposium will be held every two weeks in the future. However, such a symposium alone is not enough. Party affairs work symposiums should also be held regularly. The participants in this symposium can be decided by the democratic parties themselves. The United Front Work Department can use such a symposium to understand what difficulties the various democratic parties have in party affairs work, so as to help everyone solve some practical problems.

    Then he talked about the fact that the achievements of the United Front Work Department in the past were the main ones. For example, the United Front Work Department provided a lot of help in establishing organizations, distinguishing between the enemy and ourselves, and rectifying party affairs work in the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party. He said that some Communist Party members who participated in the democratic parties in the past generally played a role in uniting and closely connecting the two parties and gave their parties some help. Therefore, the recent move by the Communist Party to withdraw all the Communist Party members who participated in the democratic parties can only make people feel disappointed. Now, the political goals of the various democratic parties and the Communist Party are getting closer and closer. The Communist Party should earnestly treat the democratic parties as fraternal parties. However, there are still many areas where the United Front Work Department has not done enough. He hopes that the United Front Work Department can strengthen the following aspects of work in the future: 1. Help the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party solve the problem of ideological leadership; 2. Help the various democratic parties solve the problems encountered in the work of developing organizations, especially to help the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party solve the problem of the direction of developing organizations; 3. Help solve the problems of right and wrong among the democratic parties and the unity of the leadership of the democratic parties; 4. Help the various democratic parties run the Guangming Daily well; 5. Help the various democratic parties solve the problems of housing and cadre treatment.

    The United Front Work Department Should Also Unite With the Middle and Lower Levels

    Tan Zhiqing said that the staff of the China Democratic National Construction Association hope that the cadres of the China Democratic National Construction Association can have equal opportunities with the cadres of other government agencies in terms of work, welfare, and political treatment. Some phenomena make some staff members of the China Democratic National Construction Association feel that doing party affairs work in the China Democratic National Construction Association is not as promising as working in government agencies. This phenomenon is related to the phenomenon that the United Front Work Department only unites with the upper levels and not the lower levels, or even the middle levels. For example, the United Front Work Department does not have much contact with the section-level cadres in the China Democratic National Construction Association agencies. They have many difficulties in their work. For example, the China Democratic National Construction Association now has 120 local organizations, more than 40 of which have raised many specific issues to the central government, which they have difficulty solving. Therefore, he hopes that the United Front Work Department will strengthen its contact with them and be a bridge between them and the various central ministries, such as the Central Propaganda Department, so that they can know some things that cannot be seen in publications and newspapers and give them some capital to do their work well.

    Min Ganghou first raised the issue of cadres in his speech. He said that before studying, the cadres of the China Democratic League had great concerns about the issue of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision." Some comrades said: The democratic parties are "ten thousand years," and the cadres are "ten thousand deaths." Others asked: What level of government is a section-level cadre in the democratic parties equivalent to? Min Ganghou also criticized the United Front Work Department for uniting with the upper levels but not the lower levels. He hopes that the United Front Work Department will have more contact with general cadres in the future.

    Various Parties Nominate Representatives to Discuss Holding Bi-Weekly Symposiums

    At the meeting, because many people raised the opinion of holding bi-weekly symposiums, according to Minister Li Weihan's suggestion, each democratic party nominated representatives to jointly discuss specific issues related to implementation within days. These representatives are: Shao Lizi of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, Luo Longji of the China Democratic League, Tan Zhiqing of the China Democratic National Construction Association, Xu Guangping of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, Huang Qixiang of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, Yan Xichun of the China Zhi Gong Party, and Mao Yisheng of the Jiusan Society. The convener is Luo Longji.

    The symposium will continue on the tenth.

    民主党派负责人在统战部召开的座谈会上
    批评共产党员的宗派主义
    本报讯　中共中央统战部邀集各民主党派负责人和无党派民主人士举行的座谈会，9日下午继续举行。在会上发言的，有中国民主建国会副主任委员胡子昂、致公党主席陈其尤、中国国民党革命委员会中央常委王昆仑、中国农工民主党副主席黄琪翔、中国民主建国会副秘书长谭志清、中国民主同盟中央常委闵刚侯等。
    党与非党之间不应有“墙”
    胡子昂说：在目前形势下，党与民主党派的关系，需要更加紧密，但实际上，不是紧密而是相对的疏远了。比如：长期共存、互相监督的方针提出来以后，党没有与民主党派共同研究一套如何进行互相监督的具体措施，原来有些地方对民主党派的地方组织有不同程度的支持与帮助，现在反而一概不管了。胡子昂建议从组织联系的角度上，建立一套有关工作关系和工作方法上的办法和措施。对于“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，胡子昂说：工商界有人认为自己是被改造的分子，怀有阶级自卑感，怕“放”、“鸣”出来的东西不被重视；更有人怀疑“放”、“鸣”与“整”是三部曲，“放”、“鸣”以后有被整的危险；有的同志说：我们对有些政策不是没有意见的，工商界可“放”可“鸣”的东西是不少的，但有人说，政策不能争鸣，又有人说，政策可以争鸣，但不可以公开。
    胡子昂还分析了民建内部的矛盾，更具体地说，就是民建内部对目前工商界的估价问题。他说：从各方面反映的资料看，目前对工商界有两种不同的想法和看法。一种认为工商界在企业合营后，经济基础已起了根本变化。因此，在合营企业里，只有合作共事关系，没有什么阶级关系，也谈不到有什么消极的一面。他们认为对工商界要采取多鼓励的方法，工商界的积极性才能发挥，如果强调有两面性，就会增加工商界的自卑感，越发束手束脚起来。另一方面的意见是：工商界同志几年来在党和政府的教育和培养下，觉悟不断提高，其中许多人已具有了“闻过则喜”的精神。因此，对他们的成绩加以鼓励，对他们的缺点提出批评，不仅不会影响积极性，相反的，可以提高他们和加速他们的改造。胡子昂认为：应该把这两种不同意见，公开地让大家争鸣一番。
    胡子昂直率地批评了共产党员的宗派主义思想，他说：许多地方党群关系尚有距离，表现为“敬而不亲，亲而不密”。有人说，党与非党的关系中间，好像有一堵墙，一道门槛，这堵墙，这道门槛虽然不一定很厚、很高，但是，不应该存在。胡子昂并举例：如几个党员在一起谈话，有一个非党人士进来，谈话便马上停止，非党群众对于党员也有这样情况。有些党员一副严肃的“政治面孔”，使人敬而远之。有人认为：目前有些企业的党组织在工作上和学习上均先行一步，并有一套文件，这是好的，可使党员事先心中有数，但是，私方负责人会在工作上受到影响。在谈到干部问题时，胡子昂说：民建干部存有“三不管”（政府不管、工会不管、统战部不管）四不像（不像民主人士、不像工商界、不像机关干部、不像工人阶级）思想。他希望统战部帮助民建解决这些问题。
    让致公党成员多参加活动
    陈其尤发言说：机关中民主党派的成员肃反时有被捕的，但是民主党派根本不知道，或者知道了也不清楚到底因为什么而被捕。致公党有一成员，在科学院工作，被捕了，他被捕后几个月，致公党一直不知道，等到知道了，就决定开除他的党籍，但是，不久他又出来了，而且恢复了工作，至于到底为什么被捕？又为什么释放？致公党根本不知道。究竟为什么不给民主党派知道呢？陈其尤认为：是不是因为不信任？还是因为把民主党派当作一个与它的组织成员不相关的机关？但是无论是什么理由，都是不恰当的，因为这并不是什么保密问题，而是是否守法的问题。陈其尤还提出：国家的民法、刑法应及早制定并切实遵行。
    陈其尤还认为：致公党很少有机会参加北京市一级的活动，市人民代表大会没有致公党的代表，市政治协商会议没有致公党的委员，市一级的其他各种政治活动也没有致公党参加，据说因为致公党现在还没有北京市一级的机构。陈其尤认为没有市一级的机构，并不等于没有工作可做，更不等于不要参加政治活动。
    为了接待华侨，陈其尤认为应该给致公党一所比较像样的房子，目前，致公党党部的房子，实在不够用。致公党的房子原是北京办事处时期九个人编制时用的房子，现在中央编制比过去增加了几倍，不够用的程度可想而知。在谈到长期共存、互相监督问题时，陈其尤建议：民主党派对其有关的政策方针、资料应该有所了解。否则无所准绳而监督，也无所准绳而开展工作。但是，陈其尤同时认为：我们不是要求参加所有的会，获得国防机密资料，而是对我们的工作有关的会，应请民主党派参加。
    希望在这次整风中
    民主党派能够大胆发言
    王昆仑就各民主党派和无党派民主人士在政权机关中是否发挥了作用的问题，作了发言，他举出全国人民代表大会常务委员会的情况为例：指出这方面的三个缺点：在发言中，批评了人大常委会的工作，他说：民革同志反映：人大常委会了解情况少；具体讨论少；个别接触少。由于常务委员对国家情况不了解，常委会在讨论议案时，往往是临时讨论，这样讨论起来就有困难。
    有人说：为什么重大议案拿出来讨论时，尽是民主党派发言，共产党员却不发言？是否是先讨论好了，再告诉我们的。还有人认为：国家重大的方针、政策，一次会上就通过了，这样发言流于形式，应该先开小会讨论，以后常委会讨论。关于有职有权的问题，王昆仑认为：民主党派在机关中有职、有责而无权。有人批评民主党派有作客思想，他认为应进行具体分析，看看是不是把我们放在主人位置。他希望在这次整风中，民主党派能够大胆发言，把所有意见拿出来，大胆地批评共产党。在谈到对统战部的意见的时候，王昆仑说：统战部统上不统下固然是事实，但是也有人说，“上”是不是都统够了，还成问题。中、下情绪不安，愿到机关去，不愿作党派工作，主要因为统战部不重视他们，因此，他希望统战部同志应该多和他们接触。王昆仑还提出房屋困难问题。
    要把民主党派待如兄弟
    接着发言的是中国农工民主党副主席黄琪翔。他在发言中首先表示，对座谈会上已有的许多发言，都有同感。希望今后每两周召开一次这样的座谈会。但是，单是这样的座谈会还不够。还应该定期地召开党务工作座谈会。参加这个座谈会的人员可由各民主党派自行决定。统战部可以通过这样的座谈会，了解各民主党派在党务工作上，有什么困难，以便帮助大家解决一些实际问题。
    然后他谈到，过去的统战工作的成绩是主要的。比如，在农工民主党建立组织，分清敌我，整顿党务工作中，统战部就给过不少帮助。他说，过去参加民主党派的一些共产党员，一般都起了团结和密切两党关系的作用，给过他们党一些帮助。因此，近来共产党要把参加了民主党派的共产党员都抽回去，只能使人感到失望。现在，各民主党派同共产党的政治目标越来越接近了，共产党应该切实地把民主党派当作兄弟党来对待。但是，统战工作也仍然有许多作的不够的地方。他希望统战部今后能够加强如下几方面的工作：一、帮助农工民主党解决思想领导问题；二、帮助各民主党派解决在发展组织的工作中所遇到的问题特别是要帮助农工民主党解决发展组织的方向问题；三、帮助解决民主党派间的是非问题和民主党派领导层的团结问题；四、帮助各民主党派办好光明日报；五、帮助各民主党派解决房子和干部待遇问题。
    统战部也要统中统下
    谭志清发言说，民主建国会的工作人员，希望民建会的干部在工作、福利、政治待遇等方面能与其他机关的干部机会均等。有些现象，使得民建机关的一些工作人员，感到在民建作党务工作，不如在政府机关有前途、有熬头。这种现象，与统战部统上不统下，甚至也不统中的现象有关。比如，统战部对于民建机关中的处长级干部，就没有什么联系。他们在工作中有不少困难，比如，民建现在有一百二十个地方组织，其中有四十多个组织向中央提出了很多具体问题，他们都很难解决。因此，希望统战部加强同他们的联系，并且能够成为他们同中央各部，比如中宣部之间的桥梁，使他们能够知道一些在刊物和报纸上看不到的东西，给他们一些作好工作的本钱。
    闵刚侯在发言中首先提出了干部问题，他说民盟干部在学习以前，对“长期共存、互相监督”问题顾虑很大，有些同志说：民主党派是“万岁”干部是“万死”。还有人提出：民主党派处一级干部究竟相当于政府那一级？闵刚侯还对统战部统上不统下的问题作了批评，他希望统战部今后多联系一般干部。
    各党派推出代表商讨举行双周座谈会问题
    会上，因为很多人士都提出了举行双周座谈会的意见，根据李维汉部长的建议，各民主党派都推举出代表，拟于日内共同商讨有关实施方面的具体问题。这些代表是：中国国民党革命委员会邵力子、中国民主同盟罗隆基、中国民主建国会谭志清、中国民主促进会许广平、中国农工民主党黄琪翔、中国致公党严希纯、九三学社茅以升等。召集人是罗隆基。
    座谈会将于十日继续举行。
