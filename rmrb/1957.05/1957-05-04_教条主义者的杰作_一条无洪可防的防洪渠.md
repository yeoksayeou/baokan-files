Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 3rd. Xinhua News Agency reporter Wang Jian reports: As people stroll near the southern mountains of Guanzhong, they can see a dry "canal" meandering at the foot of the mountains, with a total length of forty-five kilometers. This is a flood control channel built to protect the production safety of a factory.

The construction of this flood control channel used a total of 2.6 million workdays, excavated more than 2.5 million cubic meters of earth, used 18,000 tons of cement and more than 80,000 cubic meters of rubble. It was only rushed to completion before the rainy season last year. This project occupied 1,500 mu of land and cost more than 10 million yuan, equivalent to the investment in building a textile factory with 25,000 spindles.

It is said that this flood control channel was designed according to a hundred-year flood cycle and a flood flow rate of 330 cubic meters per second. In order to channel mountain floods, the sixteen-kilometer channel body in the upper reaches is entirely made of sand, gravel concrete, and large stones firmly laid; viewed from above, it is a stone dam. In the lower reaches of the channel bottom, a "drop structure" step is built every 500 meters to缓和the impact of the flood. The widest part of this permanent flood control channel reaches 60 meters, and the narrowest is no less than 20 meters. Forty-five bridges of various sizes have also been built on this channel.

Is this channel practical? According to people who observed the floods last year: when the flood volume was large during the rainy season, the deepest water level in the channel was only three inches, and it quickly flowed away; except for the rainy season, there is no standing water in this channel at all. Local people find it inconvenient to cross the bridge, so they simply walk through the channel.

Before the construction of this flood control channel, the designers only heard that a flood had occurred near the factory some years ago. Without careful on-the-spot investigation, they used the flood level of "once every hundred years, checked every thousand years" as the basis for the design standard, and blindly pursued standards and scale. The department in charge of this project also did not strictly review the design, resulting in this irreparable loss to the country.

    教条主义者的杰作——一条无洪可防的防洪渠
    据新华社西安3日电  新华社记者汪坚报道：当人们漫步在关中南山附近，可以看到蜿蜒在山脚下的一条总长四十五公里的干涸“运河”，这是为维护一个工厂生产安全而修建的一条防洪渠。
    这条防洪渠共用了二百六十万个工作日，开挖土方二百五十多万立方公尺，用了一万八千吨水泥和八万多立方公尺料石，在去年雨季前才赶建成功。这项工程占地一千五百亩，投资一千多万元，相等于建设一座二万五千枚纱锭的纺织厂的投资。
    据说，这条防洪渠是按百年洪水位周期和三百三十秒公方的洪水流速设计的。为了输泄山洪，这条沟上游的十六公里渠身，完全是用沙石混凝土和块石牢牢砌成；居高俯瞰，就是一条石坝。在下流的渠底，每隔五百公尺建有一个“跌水”台阶，以缓和洪水的冲击力。这条永久性的防洪渠，最宽的地方达六十公尺，最窄的也不下二十公尺。在这条渠上，还建筑了大小桥梁四十五座。
    这条渠实用吗？据观察去年洪水的人谈：雨季洪水量大的时候，渠里最深水位也只有三寸，而且很快就流走了；除了雨季以外，这渠根本没有一点积水。当地群众往来嫌过桥不便，索性都在渠里通行。
    修建这条防洪渠前，设计人员只听说若干年前，在工厂附近曾经泛滥过一次洪水，未经过实地仔细考查，就拿“百年一过，千年校核”的洪水位做了设计标准的依据，而且盲目地追求标准和规模，这项工程的主管部门也没有严格审查设计，结果就给国家造成了这个不可弥补的损失。
