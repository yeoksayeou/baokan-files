Travel Notes from Sichuan
    Fang Tianbai

    Rural “New Era”

    Not long ago, I took advantage of my work to travel more than four thousand li in various parts of Sichuan, and everywhere I saw a vibrant new atmosphere.

    In the county towns and market towns, the streets during market days are always crowded with farmers, so packed that "not a drop of water could trickle through." No matter the size of the restaurant, they are all full of farmers; the department stores, fabric shops, and general stores are also full of farmers coming and going. The farmers' trading markets on the streets are even more bustling and "boiling," with some discussing the price of Berkshire pigs, and others peddling chickens, ducks, geese, and eggs... I think, our cities have existed for thousands of years, and farmers have always been treated as "country folk," despised, oppressed, fooled, and exploited; only today, after agricultural collectivization, do farmers appear in cities with the true attitude of "masters," and only then can cities better play their role in serving farmers.

    In the countryside, the people I met were all beaming with joy and in high spirits. We did not hear any farmers expressing dissatisfaction or doubt about collectivization, but we deeply realized that the vast majority of farmers accepted this new thing of collectivization much faster than many people imagined. They are steadily building the present and the future with a happy and excited mood. In the face of the collective, all difficulties can be overcome. We saw some low-lying areas being filled in (such large-scale projects would be impossible to carry out when working individually), and many hills were being "finely carved."

    When we visited the advanced cooperative in Xiandi Township, Yibin County, a farmer in charge of feeding pigs casually said a sentence that succinctly summarized the profound changes in the vast rural areas over the past year or so. He said, "From now on, as long as you are diligent and not lazy, no one will starve to death again!" Indeed, agricultural cooperatives have provided farmers with strong guarantees and great hope in terms of production and life, and have liberated the vast majority of farmers from the fate of the small-peasant economy, which for thousands of years has been impoverished, fragile, and constantly in danger of bankruptcy. What lies ahead now is simply a broad road of "developing production and improving life."

    In a word, new scenes are emerging everywhere in the countryside, the vestiges of the old countryside are disappearing rapidly, and the new era of the countryside—the new socialist countryside—has begun!

    A Prominent Problem

    Upon arriving in Sichuan, the first thing that struck us as strange was that this famous pig-producing province (with an output accounting for more than one-fifth of the country's total) was also experiencing a severe shortage of pork supply.

    Both cities and villages in Sichuan Province have implemented a rationed supply of pork. It is said that before rationing, the pork market in various places was very tense and chaotic. At one time, almost every meeting, whether at the district, township, or county and special commissioner's office level, had to discuss the issue of pork. I asked four special commissioners successively: What are the most prominent problems in the current work? All four special commissioners mentioned the problem of "pigs" unanimously.

    Such a statement may seem difficult to understand at first glance; but as long as we analyze and study many situations in current real life, we can easily understand that the problem of "pigs" is indeed a top priority in the current lives of farmers, urban-rural relations, and the development of agricultural production.

    Sichuan has a population of about 70 million, and produced more than 20 million pigs in 1956, an increase of about 2 million compared to 1955; 680,000 heads were transferred out of the province in 1956 (including the converted number of cured meat), only an increase of 340,000 heads compared to 1955. So why did the pork supply in Sichuan become particularly tight in 1956? This is mainly the result of the victory of agricultural collectivization over the past year or so, and the improvement of the lives of the vast majority of farmers. In 1956, 95% of Sichuan farmers had joined agricultural production cooperatives, and the increase in income for farmers throughout the province was equivalent to the total increase in income over the past two years. This strongly stimulated the desire of the vast majority of farmers to improve their lives. In the past few years, the first demand of farmers to improve their lives was to solve the problem of "eating enough," so grain was the most strained; in the past two years—especially with the increase in grain production in 1956, when the supply of staple food was no longer a problem, farmers demanded to "eat better," especially to be able to eat more pork. Moreover, pork can also make up for the shortage of edible vegetable oil; saving edible vegetable oil can in turn be used to make up for the shortage of lamp oil. In this way, the pork problem becomes even more prominent and important.

    The rapid increase in the demand for pork from the vast majority of farmers will inevitably affect the already strained pork market, making it even more tense. In this case, the issue of urban-rural relations will arise, because if more attention is paid to the cities, the farmers will be dissatisfied; if more attention is paid to the farmers, the cities will not get the necessary supply. This poses considerable difficulties for the work of governments at all levels. At the same time, the current large-scale agricultural production increase movement urgently requires an increase in fertilizer supply, and the main source of fertilizer at present still relies on pig manure, which can only be solved by raising a large number of pigs. From these situations, it is entirely reasonable for leading comrades in many places to regard solving the "pig" problem as a top priority in the current government work. Recently, the CPC Central Committee and the State Council issued a decision on developing pig production, which is very timely and requires the joint efforts of the people across the country to implement this decision.

    Unleash the Huge Potential of Cash Crops

    In 1956, Sichuan's grain output increased by 10% compared to 1955, exceeding the total increase in grain production over the past two years, and fulfilling the targets set by the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and exceeding them. The total output was 23.8% higher than the highest historical output in 1938. This is a historically significant and great victory, which has laid a favorable foundation for the comprehensive development of agricultural production in the future. However, the production of all kinds of cash crops did not meet the plan. Cotton output was 84.9% of the plan, sugarcane was 74.4%, and oil crops, ramie, tea, tung seeds, silkworm cocoons, medicinal materials, vegetables, etc. even decreased compared to 1955.

    Due to the failure to complete the increase in production of oil crops, sugarcane, etc., the shortage of non-staple food and lamp oil supply was increased, bringing many inconveniences to people's lives. At the same time, it also affected the increase in farmers' income and the supply of industrial raw materials. For example, farmers in Dazhu County, a famous ramie-producing area, have a high enthusiasm for planting ramie, but they are restricted by the plan and cannot develop it more. In 1956, more than 50% of the land was planted with sweet potatoes. The output of sweet potatoes was high but the price was low, and many agricultural cooperatives lost money. Due to the reduction in silkworm cocoon production, it is estimated that some silk factories will be shut down for more than a month.

    The failure to complete the plan for cash crops in 1956 seriously affected the completion of the targets for many cash crops and sideline production in the Five-Year Plan. According to the 1957 plan forecast, ramie can only complete 79% of the Five-Year Plan target, sugarcane 87%, flue-cured tobacco 68%, peanuts 92%, sesame 69%, rapeseed 94%, and silkworm cocoons 75%. How to achieve the comprehensive development of agricultural production is a major issue worthy of attention in Sichuan Province in 1957.

    Many agricultural and sideline products in Sichuan occupy an important position in the country; and there is still great potential for development. For example, sericulture: Sichuan's temperature, humidity, and hilly land for planting mulberry trees basically do not affect grain production and other superior conditions, which are better than Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Guangdong, which are now the largest sericulture bases in China. Sichuan is a province with the most promising prospects for developing sericulture in China, and the people also have experience in raising silkworms and planting mulberry trees. However, the current output of silkworm cocoons is only one-third of the highest historical output. For example, rapeseed: the unit area yield is about twice as high as other provinces, and the output accounts for one-fourth of the country, but the current output is only 86% of the highest annual output before liberation. For example, tung seeds: the output accounts for more than 40% of the country, but the output has declined in recent years, and the output in 1956 was only 92% of that in 1952. For example, sugarcane: the output accounts for one-sixth of the country, but the output in 1956 was only 87% of that in 1954. For example, tea: the output accounts for one-seventh of the country, and the output in 1956 was only 75% of the highest historical output. For example, ramie: the output of only one prefecture in Dazhu County accounts for one-eighth of the country, and the average yield of ramie per mu is more than 140 jin, which is about 30% higher than the national average yield per unit area. The high yield is 400 jin per mu. However, the ramie planting area in Dazhu County is less than 1% of the total cultivated land area, and the development potential is very large. Ramie can also be planted on mountain slopes. As long as the plan is properly arranged, Sichuan's ramie can soon be developed relatively greatly (ramie is currently very tight throughout the country, and has even seriously affected the production of fishermen—for making fishing nets). Sichuan's medicinal materials, fruits, and livestock products also occupy a fairly important position in the country, and have very broad development prospects.

    These agricultural products are urgently needed for the lives of people across the country and for industrial production, and are also important materials for foreign trade. Under the principle of centering on grain production, Sichuan needs to make greater contributions. The state should also help Sichuan produce more of these products that are produced less or not produced in other regions, so that China's agricultural production can be developed faster and more comprehensively.

    川行杂记
    方天白
    农村“新纪元”
    不久以前，我乘工作之便，在四川各地走了四千多里路，一路上到处都看到洋溢着一片生气勃勃的新气象。
    在县城、集镇，集日里的街道总是被农民挤得“水泄不通”。无论大小饭馆里，坐满的都是农民；百货店、花布店、杂货铺进进出出的也全是农民。街头上的农民交易市场，更是喧嚷得“热火朝天”，有的人在商讨克郎猪的价格，有的人在兜卖鸡、鸭、鹅、蛋……。我想，我们的城市生存了几千年了，从来农民都是被作为“乡下人”受贱视、受压迫、受愚弄、受剥削的；只有到了农业合作化以后的今天，农民才以真正“主人翁”的恣态出现于城市，城市也才有可能更好地发挥为农民服务的作用。
    在农村，见到的人也都是喜气洋洋、精神爽朗。我们没有听到农民对合作化有什么不满或怀疑，倒是深刻地体会到：广大农民接受合作化这个新鲜事物，要比许多人所想像的快得不可比拟。他们正以愉快、兴奋的心情，踏实地在缔造着现在和将来。在集体的面前，一切困难都能够克服。我们看到有些山凹地正在被填平（这样比较大的工程在单干时是不可能进行的），许多山丘则被“精雕细刻”着。
    我们在参观宜宾县仙地乡高级社的时候，一个负责喂猪的农民随口说出的一句话，倒是很扼要地总结了一年多来广大农村“翻天覆地”的深刻变化。他说：“今后么，只要勤劳不偷懒，就再也饿不倒人了！”的确，农业合作社在生产上、生活上给了农民有力的保证和巨大的希望，已经使广大农民从几千年来贫困、脆弱、并随时有破产危险的小农经济的命运中解放了出来，现在摆在面前的，已经只是一条“发展生产，改善生活”的康庄大道了。
    一句话，农村里新的情景到处在涌现，旧农村的遗迹飞快地在消逝，农村的新纪元——社会主义的新农村——已经开始了！
    一个突出的问题
    一到四川，首先使我们感到奇怪的是，这个著名的产猪省份（产量占全国五分之一强），猪肉的供应竟也闹得很紧张。
    四川省的城市和乡村都已经实行了猪肉的定量供应。据说在定量供应以前，各地的猪肉市场是十分紧张和混乱的。曾经有一个时期，无论是区、乡或是县和专署的会议，差不多每一次都要讨论到猪肉的问题。我曾经前后问过四位专员：当前工作中有些什么问题最突出？四位专员都不约而同地提到“猪”的问题。
    这样说法，乍听起来似乎是不好理解的；但是只要对当前现实生活中的许多情况加以分析研究，我们就能够很容易地了解到，“猪”的问题，实在是当前农民生活、城乡关系以及发展农业生产中的一个头等重要的问题。
    四川人口约七千万，1956年产猪两千多万头，比1955年增产约二百万头；1956年外调六十八万头（包括腌腊肉折合数）比1955年只增加了三十四万头。那么为什么1956年四川的猪肉供应反而会突出地紧张起来呢？这主要是一年多来农业合作化的胜利，广大农民生活改善了的结果。1956年，四川农民已经有95％参加了农业生产合作社，全省农民增加的收入相当于过去两年增加收入的总和。这就有力地刺激了广大农民改善生活的要求。过去几年，农民改善生活首先要求解决的是“吃饱”的问题，因而粮食曾经是最紧张的；近两年来——特别是1956年粮食增产，口粮已经不成问题，农民就要求“吃得好”一些，尤其要求能够多吃一点猪肉。而且，猪肉还可以弥补食用植物油的不足；节省了食用植物油又可用来弥补灯用油的不足。这样，猪肉问题就显得更加突出重要了。
    广大农民对猪肉需要的迅速增长，必然会影响到原来就已供不应求的猪肉市场更加紧张起来。在这样情况下，又会发生城乡关系的问题，因为照顾城市多了，农民就会不满；照顾农民多了，城市就得不到必要的供应。这对各级政府的工作来说，是有不少困难的。同时，当前大规模农业增产运动又迫切要求增加肥料供应，而目前肥料的主要来源还是要靠猪粪肥，也只有大量养猪才能得到解决。从这些情况看来，许多地方领导同志把解决“猪”的问题作为当前政府工作中的一项头等重要任务，是完全有道理的。最近，中共中央和国务院发布了关于发展养猪生产的决定，是非常合乎时宜的，需要全国人民共同努力来贯彻实现这个决定。
    发挥经济作物的巨大潜力
    1956年四川粮食产量比1955年增加10％，超过过去两年粮食增产的总和，提前超额完成了五年计划所规定的指标，总产量比历史产量最高的1938年还要多23.8％，这是有历史意义的巨大胜利，为今后农业生产的全面发展奠定了有利的基础。但是，各种经济作物的生产却全部没有完成计划，棉花产量为计划的84.9％，甘蔗为74.4％，油料、苎麻、茶叶、桐籽、蚕茧、药材、蔬菜等还比1955年减产了。
    由于油料、甘蔗等没有完成增产任务，增加了副食品和灯油供应的紧张程度，给人民生活带来许多不便。同时也影响到农民收入的增加和工业原料的供应。例如著名的苎麻产地大竹县的农民，种麻情绪很高，但受计划限制不能更多地发展，1956年有50％以上的地种了红苕，红苕产多价低，许多农业社赔了本。由于蚕茧减产，估计有部分丝厂将停工一个多月。
    1956年经济作物没有完成计划，严重影响到五年计划中许多经济作物和副业生产的指标完不成。根据1957年的计划预计，苎麻只能完成五年计划指标的79％，甘蔗87％，烤烟68％，花生92％，芝麻69％，菜籽94％，蚕茧75％。如何使农业生产获得全面的发展，是四川省1957年值得注意的一个重大问题。
    四川有许多农副产品在全国占有重要的地位；现在还存在着很大的发展潜力。如蚕桑，四川的温度、湿度以及丘陵地植桑基本上不致影响粮食生产等优越条件，胜过于我国现在最大的蚕桑基地的江、浙和广东，是我国发展蚕桑事业最有前途的一个省份，人民也有养蚕植桑的经验，可是现在蚕茧的产量只及历史最高产量的三分之一。如菜籽，单位面积产量比别的省约高一倍，产量占全国四分之一，可是现在的产量只及解放前最高年产量的86％。如桐籽，产量占全国40％以上，但近年来减产了，1956年产量只及1952年的92％。如甘蔗，产量占全国六分之一，但1956年产量只及1954年的87％。如茶叶，产量占全国七分之一，1956年产量只及历史最高产量的75％。如苎麻，只达县一个分区的产量就占全国八分之一，每亩苎麻平均产量一百四十多斤，比全国平均单位面积产量约高30％，高产量有每亩四百斤的。但达县分区苎麻种植面积还不到耕地总面积的1％，发展潜力是很大的。苎麻还可以在山坡地种植，只要把计划加以适当地安排，四川的苎麻很快就能够得到比较大的发展（苎麻现在全国都很紧张，甚至已经严重影响到渔民的生产——作渔网）。四川的药材、水果和畜产品等在全国也占相当重要的地位，并有着非常广阔的发展前途。
    这些农产品，是全国人民生活和工业生产所迫切需要的，也是对外贸易的重要物资，在以粮食生产为中心的原则下，需要四川作出更大的贡献。国家也应该帮助四川多生产这些为其它地区所少产或不产的产品，使我国的农业生产能够得到更快和更全面的发展。（未完）
