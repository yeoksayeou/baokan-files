Xinhua News Agency, April 4th, Moscow, TASS, April 3rd: The Soviet Peace Defense Committee issued a statement, expressing warm support for the documents on the cessation of atomic and hydrogen weapon tests adopted by the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council at its Berlin meeting this year.

The statement calls on the Soviet public to actively participate in this movement through various means such as holding rallies, mass meetings, congresses, and representative conferences, as well as publishing opinions in newspapers and radio stations.

The Soviet Peace Defense Committee expressed the hope that peace-loving friends in all countries will make every effort to ensure that an agreement on the cessation of nuclear weapon testing is concluded immediately, and that the governments of relevant countries make decisions as quickly as possible to prohibit nuclear weapons, stop manufacturing nuclear weapons, and completely destroy stockpiled nuclear weapons.

Xinhua News Agency, April 4th, Cairo, TASS, April 4th: The Egyptian National Peace Council issued a statement calling for strengthened struggle to prohibit atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and all other weapons of mass destruction.

The statement pointed out that the U.S. government has decided to equip the U.S. Sixth Fleet, concentrated not far from our country and other Arab countries, with devastating atomic weapons, and has also decided to establish military bases in Turkey, Iran, Lebanon, Libya, and Saudi Arabia for U.S. troops equipped with atomic and hydrogen weapons.

The statement said that these aggressive measures by the U.S. government pose a great danger to world peace and a serious threat to the people of our country and other Arab countries.

The Egyptian National Peace Council also calls on Egyptian peace advocates to support the following demands:

    One, to resolve the Palestinian issue immediately and justly in accordance with the 1947 resolutions of the United Nations and the Security Council, to repatriate Arab refugees, return their property, and fairly compensate them for all losses suffered when they were expelled from their homes.

    Two, compensation to Egypt for the losses suffered as a result of the aggressive invasion by British, French, and Israeli troops.

    Three, all countries possessing atomic and hydrogen weapons should sign an agreement prohibiting the use and production of such weapons and immediately destroying existing weapons of this kind.

    Four, the immediate and complete withdrawal of American and all other foreign troops stationed in Arab countries.

    Five, all Near East countries should declare that they will not allow their territories to be used for the construction of atomic and hydrogen weapon bases.

    Six, abolish military pacts, especially the Baghdad Pact, which poses a direct threat to the security and autonomy of Arab countries.

Xinhua News Agency, April 4th, Tokyo dispatch: The Japan Peace Committee held a standing council meeting on May 2nd, and passed a draft movement policy centered on prohibiting atomic and hydrogen bombs, restoring diplomatic relations between Japan and China, and abolishing unequal Japan-U.S. treaties.

The draft movement policy stipulates that the power of the people should be united to launch a mass movement against the pre-registration system for atomic and hydrogen bomb tests advocated by the Japanese government, demanding that the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union immediately begin negotiations on concluding an agreement to prohibit nuclear weapon testing, and calling on the broad masses of the people to concentrate their efforts to ensure the success of the Third World Conference against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs to be held in Tokyo this August.

The draft stipulates that a mass movement should be launched to demand the mutual establishment of commercial representative offices between China and Japan and the relaxation of embargoes, and that the Japanese government should immediately send representatives to China to negotiate with the Chinese government in order to resolve the outstanding issues between China and Japan.

The draft also stipulates that before Nobusuke Kishi visits the United States, the forces of the people across the country should be concentrated to launch a movement demanding the abolition of unequal treaties, and resolutely opposing all U.S. interference in Middle Eastern countries, including Jordan.
