Xinhua News Agency reports: The movement against atomic and nuclear weapons testing and demanding the prohibition of nuclear weapons is expanding more and more widely in various countries.

    Japan
    Tokyo Dispatch: The people of Sunagawa-cho, who bravely opposed the expansion of the Tachikawa base by the United States, held a mass rally on the 25th to oppose the introduction of nuclear weapons into Japan and to defend Sunagawa.
    The conference passed the following important resolutions: Oppose the expansion of Sunagawa Base; demand the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen bomb testing; demand the immediate conclusion of an agreement on the prohibition of nuclear weapons; oppose the introduction of nuclear weapons into Japan; demand the abolition of the unequal Japan-U.S. treaty.
    The conference also passed an emergency resolution demanding that the United States hand over the American soldier who killed a Japanese woman in Soumagahara, Gunma Prefecture, to Japan for trial.
    Matsumoto Jiichiro, representative of the National Liaison Conference Against Military Bases in Japan, Yasui Iku, representative of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, and representatives from the Socialist Party, the Communist Party, religious circles, and cultural circles all spoke at the meeting. Representatives of the masses near various U.S. military bases across the country also participated in the meeting.
    India
    New Delhi Dispatch: The National Peace Conference convened by the All-India Peace Council opened in Bangalore on the evening of May 24. The conference will discuss launching a strong movement against nuclear weapons testing.
    When presiding over the opening ceremony of the conference, former Governor-General of India, Rajagopalachari, strongly advocated the immediate cessation of nuclear weapons testing and the prohibition of nuclear weapons. He called on Britain to declare itself a "neutral" country and take unilateral action to stop nuclear bomb testing. He urged all Commonwealth countries to pass resolutions in their respective parliaments opposing the manufacture and testing of nuclear weapons. Rajagopalachari also strongly criticized the U.S. rulers' advocacy of the use of atomic and hydrogen bombs.
    Vietnam
    Hanoi Dispatch: The Vietnam Committee for the Defense of World Peace and other mass organizations held a joint meeting on the 24th and decided to strengthen the struggle against preparations for atomic warfare among the Vietnamese people.
    Hanoi newspapers published a joint statement on the 26th from the Vietnam Committee for the Defense of World Peace and other organizations, condemning the recent atomic and hydrogen bomb tests conducted by the U.S. and British imperialists, their intensification of the arms race, and their actions of equipping West Germany, NATO's aggressive forces, and U.S. troops stationed abroad with atomic weapons.
    The statement expressed a warm welcome to the recent Soviet proposal that all countries jointly stop or temporarily suspend atomic and hydrogen weapon tests, and jointly conclude an agreement prohibiting the use of these weapons.
    Thailand
    Bangkok Dispatch: A spokesman for the Thai Free Democratic Party, Nai Rong Yensira, delivered an appeal to the British Embassy in Thailand on the 17th in the name of the party.
    The appeal condemned the British government's attitude of insisting on hydrogen bomb testing, disregarding the demands of peace-loving people around the world. The appeal demanded that the British government stop hydrogen bomb testing.
    Britain
    London Dispatch: At the initiative of the British Peace Committee, Britain is launching a broad signature-gathering campaign calling for an international agreement to ban nuclear weapons testing and ultimately ban such weapons.
    The British women's movement against nuclear weapons testing, initiated by Short, a Hertfordshire County Councillor and Labor Party member, is still underway. These days, several women dressed entirely in black (as a symbol of the tragedy caused by nuclear weapons) are waiting in the House of Commons lounge every day to meet with members of parliament in order to protest Britain's hydrogen weapon testing in the Pacific.
    United States
    New York Dispatch: When the journal "Wallace's Farmer and Iowa Homestead" solicited opinions from Iowa farmers on proposals to achieve an international agreement to ban hydrogen weapons testing, most farmers expressed their support in their speeches.
    A resolution was passed at a conference of teachers and parents on educational issues held in Cincinnati calling for an international agreement to cease the testing and use of hydrogen weapons and other nuclear weapons.
    The "New York World-Telegram and Sun" and several other newspapers published an article written by a man named Robaugh, in which the author agreed to ban nuclear weapons and "turn nuclear weapons into atomic power plants to irrigate the desert."
    Canada
    Ottawa Dispatch: Canada's movement calling for a ban on nuclear weapons testing is combined with the election campaign. The Labor Progressive Party has placed the issue of banning hydrogen bomb testing at the center of its election platform.
    A priest from Winnipeg, Peterson, sent an open letter to all parliamentary candidates and Canadian political parties, calling for measures to ban nuclear weapons testing. Dr. Wen Youzhang, chairman of the Canadian Peace Congress, issued an appeal to all candidates urging the Canadian government to insist on the immediate cessation of hydrogen bomb testing by all governments at the United Nations Disarmament Committee Sub-committee.
