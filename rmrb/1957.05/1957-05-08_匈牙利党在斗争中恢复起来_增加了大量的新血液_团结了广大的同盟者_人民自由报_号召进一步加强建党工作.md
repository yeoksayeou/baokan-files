Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, 7th. The Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party organ "People's Free Press" published an editorial stating that the party's recovery phase has ended. There are now approximately 300,000 party members nationwide, and especially in recent weeks, many industrial workers have applied to join the party.

The editorial, titled "Further Strengthening Party Building," stated that the unity of our party has been consolidated in the struggle against counter-revolution and in the struggle against revisionism and other opportunist viewpoints. Politically exposing and condemning Nagy's betrayal has added tens of thousands of genuine communists to the party, while also removing a batch of bad elements. In party building, a struggle against sectarianism was also carried out. Therefore, our party has recovered in sharp struggle. Our party is stronger than the Hungarian Working People's Party because it is composed of seasoned Communist Party members, and it educates its members with painful historical experiences.

The editorial said that to unite the sympathizers of the party's cause around the party, the party must resolutely oppose the petty-bourgeois viewpoints, vacillation, and their influence within the party. However, we are not against petty-bourgeois elements, who are our allies in the cause of socialist construction.

The editorial pointed out that the most important task is to defend the cause of the party. Although we have said this in the past, it was not until the October events that we truly understood the great significance of party unity for the party's cause. The guarantee of the party's cause is to unswervingly oppose revisionism and learn from past mistakes. Relaxing ideological struggle, making concessions to revisionism, and spreading unprincipled harmony will only hinder the further consolidation of party unity. It is necessary to resolutely stop all kinds of unprincipled disputes.

    匈牙利党在斗争中恢复起来
    增加了大量的新血液　团结了广大的同盟者
    “人民自由报”号召进一步加强建党工作
    据新华社布达佩斯7日电　匈牙利社会主义工人党机关报“人民自由报”发表社论说，党的恢复阶段已经结束，现在全国已经有三十万左右党员了，特别在最近几个星期来，许多产业工人纷纷申请入党。
    这篇以“进一步加强建党工作”为题的社论说，我们党的团结是在反对反革命的斗争中，在反对修正主义和其他机会主义观点的斗争中巩固起来的。由于从政治上揭露和谴责了纳吉的背叛罪行，使党增加了数万真正的共产主义者，同时也清除了一批坏分子。在建党中也进行了反对宗派主义的斗争。因此，我们党是在尖锐的斗争中恢复起来的。我们的党是比匈牙利劳动人民党要坚强些，因为我们党是由久经锻炼的共产党员所组成的，它并且以惨痛的历史经验来教育自己的党员们。
    社论说，要把党的事业的同情者团结在党的周围，党必须在党内坚决地反对小资产阶级的观点、动摇性及其影响，但是我们并不是反对小资产阶级分子，他们是我们在社会主义建设事业中的同盟者。
    社论指出，最重要的任务是保卫党的事业。过去我们虽然也这样讲，但是直到十月事件中，我们才真正的懂得了党的团结对党的事业有多巨大的意义。党的事业的保证是坚持不渝地反对修正主义和从过去的错误中吸取教训。如果放松思想斗争，对修正主义让步和散布无原则的一团和气，只会妨碍党的团结的进一步巩固。必须坚决地制止各种无原则的纠纷。
