Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 22nd: At a grand reception held on the evening of May 21st by Vice Premier Phan Kế Toại for him, Chairman Voroshilov strongly appealed for world peace and against war.

Prime Minister Phạm Văn Đồng was unable to attend the activities welcoming the Soviet guests for the past two days due to illness.

At the reception, Voroshilov said that there should be no war among people. People should help and understand each other and should enjoy the right to freedom and peaceful life. Chairman Voroshilov was accompanied by President Ho Chi Minh at this grand reception last night. When Voroshilov and other Soviet guests entered the brightly lit hall, the audience applauded warmly and continuously.

At the beginning of the reception, Phan Kế Toại delivered a speech warmly welcoming the Soviet guests. He said that Chairman Voroshilov's visit to China, Vietnam, and Mongolia will play a significant role in strengthening the friendship between the countries of the socialist camp.

Voroshilov sincerely thanked the host for the warm reception and proposed a toast to the prosperity of young Vietnam, to the health of the host, to the unity of the socialist camp, and to world peace. He also wished Prime Minister Phạm Văn Đồng a speedy recovery.

At 6:30 p.m. yesterday, President Ho Chi Minh paid a return visit to Chairman Voroshilov. He was accompanied by Tôn Đức Thắng, Phan Kế Toại, Võ Nguyên Giáp, and Ung Văn Khiêm.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 22nd: This morning, Chairman Voroshilov and his entourage, accompanied by Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister Võ Nguyên Giáp and Chairman of the Hanoi Municipal Administrative Committee Trần Duy Hưng, visited the Hanoi Machine Factory and toured the Hanoi city area and scenic spots.

During his visit to the Hanoi Machine Factory, Voroshilov said to the more than 1,000 workers who participated in the construction of the factory: "You are the first builders of the new industry for the beautiful motherland, you are the first to lay the first brick on the economic and cultural construction base of the motherland, I congratulate you!" He encouraged the workers to learn while doing, saying, "Only by learning can you increase your knowledge and complete tasks." His loud, emotional, and humorous voice was constantly interrupted by applause.

The Hanoi Machine Factory is the first machine factory to be built in Vietnam with Soviet assistance. This factory will manufacture various machine tools and new agricultural tools that Vietnam urgently needs.

After leaving the Hanoi Machine Factory, the motorcade carrying Voroshilov and his entourage circled around the beautiful northwest suburbs of Hanoi and entered the city. Citizens cheered on both sides of the bustling streets. Soon, the cars arrived in front of the Ngoc Son Temple, a scenic spot on Hoan Kiem Lake in the city center. The lush phoenix trees on the banks of Hoan Kiem Lake were covered with golden-red flowers, and beautiful reflections were projected in the lake. Voroshilov took pictures at the pavilion of the Ngoc Son Temple in the heart of the lake.
