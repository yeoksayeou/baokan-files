Non-Party Intellectuals Criticize the Central Handicraft Industry Administration
Work is Unplanned and Slow
    (Our report) The Party Group of the Central Handicraft Industry Administration invited engineering and technical personnel and non-Party intellectuals to a forum on the 16th, 17th, and 21st.

    Song Zhiying, chairman of the China Democratic Party Light Industry Branch, said at the forum: Party member leading cadres don't necessarily not want to do a good job, but because there is no prior decision, no plan, and no foresight, they do things when they want to, and do things when their superiors tell them to, resulting in a chaotic mess. Some cadres are so busy that they get sick, while others are sound asleep. When making the fifteen-year plan for handicrafts last year, they demanded it immediately. In order to complete the task, they had to close their doors and make guesses out of thin air. After the plan was completed, it sank without a trace.

    Last year, Li Jishen, a representative of the National People's Congress, made suggestions for improving Beijing cloisonné, jade, ivory carvings, and other crafts. The General Office of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress set a deadline for a reply. After the document was processed, it was sent to the bureau chief for approval as an urgent document. It was put aside for five days, then transferred from the receiving and dispatching office to the general office, where it was put aside for another four days, and then the general office put it aside for another five days. In total, it took fourteen days to send out this urgent official document.

    Chen Gutao, an old artist from Tianjin, wrote to us, saying that a mountain in the western part of Chifeng, in Hohhot, produces jade, with high output and good quality, surpassing the newly produced jade in Fujian and Zhejiang. However, there has been no follow-up until now.

    Song Zhiying also mentioned: In terms of personnel arrangements, the leadership treats arts and crafts as general work, believing that anyone can lead arts and crafts work. For example, the Tianjin Handicraft Industry Cooperative mobilized 20 to 30 people to establish a special handicraft department. They don't understand what arts and crafts are, and they don't know whether embroidery and lace are art. They asked paper-cutting artists to paste paper boxes and wood carving artists to carve words, making people laugh and cry. However, they are still unwilling to trust non-Party experts. The handicraft departments in Shandong, Hubei, Yunnan, and other places are also led by general party members. They do things muddle-headedly without understanding, resulting in a complete mess.

    More than ten people, including Li Weihua, Zhu Yaqiang, Xu Da, Guan Zhengding, Ren Xingbang, and Meng Shou Zeng, also spoke at the forum.

### 党外知识分子批评中央手工业管理局  工作没有计划，做事拖沓

    党外知识分子批评中央手工业管理局
    工作没有计划，做事拖沓
    本报讯　中央手工业管理局党组于16、17和21日，邀请工程技术人员和党外知识分子座谈。
    农工民主党轻工业支部主任委员宋之英在座谈会上说：党员领导干部并不是不想把工作做好，但因事先没准，没有计划，没有预见性，想做就做，上级叫做就做，忙得乱烘烘一团。有的干部忙得生了病，有的干部却在睡大觉。去年作手工业十五年规划的时候，说要就要，为完成任务，只好闭门造车，凭空去想。规划做完后，就石沉海底，永无声息了。
    去年，全国人民代表大会代表李济深提出改进北京景泰蓝、玉器、象牙雕刻等工艺品的意见，人民代表大会常务委员会办公厅限期答复。文件办理后，作为特急文件送交局长核批，搁了五天，又从收发室转到办公厅又搁了四天，办公厅又搁了五天，一共搁了十四天才把这紧急公文发出去。
    天津老艺人陈古陶曾写信给我们，说呼和浩特的赤峰西部有一山出产玉石，产量多，质量好，比福建、浙江新产的玉石有过之无不及，但是，直到现在也没有下文。
    宋之英还谈到：在人事安排上，领导上把工艺美术当作一般的工作看待，认为任何人都可以做领导工艺美术工作。如天津手工业联社调集了二、三十人，成立了特种手工艺处，他们都不懂什么叫工艺美术，不知道刺绣花边是不是美术，他们叫剪纸艺人去糊纸盒子，叫木雕艺人去刻字，弄得人啼笑皆非。但他们仍不肯放手信任非党行家，山东、湖北、云南等地手工业部门，也都由一般党员来领导，不懂就糊里糊涂地干，结果干了一团糟。
    在座谈会上发言的，还有李维华、朱亚强、徐达、关征定、任兴邦、孟受增等十多人。
