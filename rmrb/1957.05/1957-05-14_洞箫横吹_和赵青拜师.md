    "Playing the Dongxiao Horizontally" and Zhao Qing's Apprenticeship
            Yang Shuang
    An article titled "The First Symposium Held by the Chinese Dramatists Association" was published in the People's Daily on May 1st. It included the following passage:
    Wu Xue appealed at the meeting regarding the lukewarm reception of newly created plays. He said: In words, everyone is saying that they want to support and value newly created plays, but in reality, the growth of this tender flower encounters great resistance, with many difficulties. He said that the China Youth Art Theatre recently rehearsed "Playing the Dongxiao Horizontally," inviting people from the literary and art circles. It just so happened that on that day, a famous Peking Opera actor was taking the daughter of a movie actor as his apprentice, which was very lively, and the theater had quite a few empty seats. Wu Xue said: The most terrible thing is indifference....
    Comrade Wu Xue's appeal for everyone to support and value newly created plays may be correct, but the example he cited does not correspond to the actual situation. I participated in the "lively" event he mentioned, where "a famous Peking Opera actor was taking the daughter of a movie actor as his apprentice." The so-called "famous Peking Opera actor" is Yu Lianquan, whose stage name is Xiao Cuihua. The "movie actor" is Zhao Dan from the Shanghai Film Studio, and his "daughter" is Zhao Qing, an actress from the Central Experimental Opera House Dance Troupe.
    A total of forty-odd people attended the apprenticeship ceremony. As far as I know, nearly half of the guests were colleagues from the Shanghai Film Studio who came to Beijing to participate in the founding meeting of the China Film Workers Association and the Excellent Film Awards Ceremony. These visitors from Shanghai did not receive tickets for "Playing the Dongxiao Horizontally." The other half of the guests were Peking Opera actors and their families, who also would not have been likely to receive tickets for "Playing the Dongxiao Horizontally." Naturally, it is possible that some people had tickets for "Playing the Dongxiao Horizontally" but came here instead, but it would only be a very small number, one or two. I think even if all forty people had tickets and didn't go to the play, it wouldn't have caused "the theater to have quite a few empty seats"; such a statement is completely untrue.
    Furthermore, Zhao Qing is a young generation dancer. In recent years, these young actors, in order to explore and create paths for national dance, decided to learn from traditional opera dance as the first step in creating national dance, and "traveled a thousand miles to seek a teacher," (note) to learn traditional Peking Opera dance performance art from Yu Lianquan, the master of Peking Opera Hua Dan art. She respected the traditions of her predecessors and held a solemn apprenticeship ceremony according to the customs left by her teacher. The apprenticeship ceremony that day was very touching. Mr. Yu Lianquan first paid his respects to his own teacher, Mr. Xiao Changhua, and then Zhao Qing paid her respects to Mr. Yu Lianquan. On that day, Mr. Yu gave an excited speech, expressing his deep expectations for his student. Comrade Tian Han, Chairman of the Chinese Dramatists Association, and Zhao Qing's father, Zhao Dan, also spoke, both emphasizing the importance of new literary and art workers learning from traditional national arts.
    As an act of learning from tradition, Zhao Qing's apprenticeship is a vivid example of putting it into practice. From the perspective of the development of our national dance, it deserves our welcome and praise, but here it is considered by Comrade Wu Xue to be an "obstacle" to "newly created plays."
    Why society is indifferent to "new plays" is worth studying. But to think that being indifferent to "a famous Peking Opera actor taking the daughter of a movie actor as his apprentice" is a way to show "support and importance" to "new plays" is unfair.
    (Note: The "thousand miles" here refers to the spiritual distance between the new and the old in the past.)

    “洞箫横吹”和赵青拜师
            杨双
    在5月1日的人民日报上登载了一篇“中国戏剧家协会召开的第一次座谈会”的报道，上面有这样一段：
    吴雪在会上为话剧的新创作剧目受到冷淡而呼吁。他说：口头上，大家都在说要扶持和重视新创作剧目，实际上，这朵幼嫩花朵的成长，遇到很大的阻力，困难很多。他说，中国青年艺术剧院最近彩排“洞箫横吹”，招待文艺界，恰好那天有一位著名京剧演员收一位电影演员的女儿做徒弟，那里很热闹，剧场里可空了不少座位。吴雪说：最可怕的是冷淡……。
    吴雪同志呼吁大家应该扶持和重视新创作剧目也许是正确的，但是他所举出的事例却与实际情况不符。我是参加了他所说的“一位著名京剧演员收一位电影演员的女儿做徒弟”的“热闹”的。所谓“著名京剧演员”就是艺名小翠花的于连泉先生，所谓“电影演员”是上海电影制片厂的赵丹同志，他的“女儿”是中央实验歌剧院舞蹈团演员赵青同志。
    参加了那次收徒典礼的一共四十几个人。据我所知，有将近半数的客人是来北京参加中国电影工作者联谊会成立大会和优秀影片授奖大会的上海电影制片厂的工作同志，这些上海来客是没有得到“洞箫横吹”的戏票的；另外半数来客是京剧演员和他们的家属，他们也是不可能得到“洞箫横吹”的戏票的。自然有人得到“洞箫横吹”的戏票而却到这里来了那也是可能的，但却是极少数的一两个人。我想即使是四十个人全是得到戏票而没有去看戏，也不会使得“剧场里可空了不少座位”；这样的说法完全不是事实。
    再说赵青是年青一辈的舞蹈家。她们这些年青演员为了探索创造民族舞蹈的途径，决定了向传统的戏曲舞蹈学习作为创造民族舞蹈的第一步，并且“千里投师”，（注）向著名的京剧花旦艺术的表演大师于连泉先生学习传统的京剧舞蹈表演艺术。她尊重先辈的传统，按照老师留下来的习惯举行了庄严的拜师礼。那天的拜师礼是非常令人感动的，于连泉先生先向他自己的老师萧长华先生行礼，然后赵青再向于连泉先生行礼。那天于先生兴奋致词，对他的学生寄予深切的期望；讲话的还有中国戏剧家协会的主席田汉同志和赵青的父亲赵丹同志，他们都特别着重说明了新文艺工作者向传统的民族艺术学习的重要。
    作为向传统学习，赵青的拜师正是身体力行的生动事例。从我们民族舞蹈的发展说来，它值得我们欢迎和表扬，但在这里却被吴雪同志认为是“新创作剧目”的“阻力”了。
    社会上为什么对“新剧目”冷淡，值得研究。但是认为对“一位著名的京剧演员收一位电影演员的女儿做徒弟”应该冷淡些才是对“新剧目”表示了“扶持和重视”，那却是不公平的。
    （注：这里的“千里”，指的是过去新和旧的精神距离而言。）
