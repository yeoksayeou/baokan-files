    Soviet Supreme Soviet Session Features Heated Discussions
    Unanimous Support for New Management System
    (Our Combined Reports) The joint session of the two chambers of the Soviet Supreme Soviet saw heated discussions on improving the national economic management system. Representatives from almost all republics and many states spoke, introducing the situation of discussions in their respective regions and summarizing the organizational structure and economic development prospects of future economic zones.
    At the morning session on May 9th, a Supreme Soviet committee headed by Khrushchev was established. Its task is to review the suggestions and amendments put forward in the discussion of Khrushchev's report, as well as drafts of supplements and amendments to the Soviet Constitution.
    Judging from the materials provided by the representatives in the two-day discussion, each future economic zone will be a powerful industrial base. The reduction of institutional levels under the new management system is very obvious. For example, the Belorussian economic zone will uniformly manage 835 enterprises, which were previously managed by 28 ministries. The Khabarovsk Krai in the Far East cannot be regarded as an economically particularly developed region, but this region has 460 enterprises and 80 construction institutions. Khabarovsk is thousands of kilometers away from Moscow, but until now, these enterprises were managed remotely by 32 ministries. After the reorganization, they will be managed by the Krai Soviet Executive Committee and the National Economic Committee to be established. During the discussion, representatives offered many opinions on whether the republics should retain some ministries. Tajik representative Ulichabayev advocated abolishing the national inspection departments of the Union Republics and expanding the role of the All-Union National Inspection Department, so that inspection personnel and the masses could jointly supervise the work of the National Economic Committees. Ukrainian representative Chashedek opposed retaining the specialized ministries of the Union, believing that specialized ministries would not do anything more beneficial than the National Economic Committees, and departments such as the Ministry of Chemical Industry could be changed into a division of the State Planning Commission, which would greatly reduce staffing.
    From the discussion, the advantages of the new management system can be roughly seen. First, the new management system will greatly reduce management levels, making it easier to absorb the masses into management. At the same time, leaders are closer to production and can solve problems on the spot in a timely manner. Second, the production capacity within the region will be rationally utilized. Third, cooperation and specialization issues will be easier to resolve. If cooperation could only be carried out within one ministry in the past, now the scope of cooperation is broader. Fourth, many technicians who were previously confined to institutions can be greatly liberated. Representatives from Ukraine proposed that the republic could liberate 3,500 personnel to go into production. As for reducing the phenomenon of reverse transportation and lack of communication, that goes without saying.
    Representatives also enthusiastically put forward opinions on how to implement the reorganization and how to prevent possible problems during the reorganization. On the issue of cadres, Leningrad representative Kozlov emphasized that carefully selecting the cadres of the National Economic Committee is one of the most important tasks. The experts who are freed up from the ministries, the best part of the Party and economic work activists, and those who do not have departmentalism, bureaucracy, and conservatism should be transferred to work in the National Economic Committee. Academician Bardin said: We should concentrate wisdom and experience rather than people in the National Economic Committee; otherwise, in the future, we will find bloated staffing not in Moscow but in various places.
    Grishin, Chairman of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, said: During the nationwide discussion, workers put forward many opinions on improving the work of trade unions. Their basic idea is to maintain the principle of forming trade unions according to production specialties and strengthen the trade unions of the republics and localities, so that the leadership of the trade unions is close to the localities. These issues will be resolved at the upcoming plenary session of the Council. The shortcomings of trade union work lie in paying more attention to the outstanding performers and less helping the laggards when organizing competitions. The specialized ministries do not pay much attention to how the factory administration implements specific contracts. This problem will be resolved after the new method of industrial management is implemented.

### 苏联最高苏维埃会议上发言热烈  一致拥护新管理制度

    苏联最高苏维埃会议上发言热烈
    一致拥护新管理制度
    本报综合报道　苏联最高苏维埃两院联席会议对改善国民经济管理制度的讨论非常热烈。几乎所有共和国和许多州的代表都发了言，介绍了本地区讨论的情况，综述了将来经济区的组织结构和经济发展的远景。
    在9日上午的会议上成立了一个以赫鲁晓夫为首的最高苏维埃委员会。它的任务是，审查在对赫鲁晓夫报告的讨论中所提出的建议和修正案，以及对苏联宪法的补充和修正的草案。
    从代表们在两天的讨论中所提供的材料来看，将来的每个经济区都是一个强大的工业基地。新管理制度下机构层次的减少是非常明显的了。例如，白俄罗斯经济区将统一管理八百三十五个企业，而这些企业过去是由二十八个部管理的。远东的伯力边疆区不能算作一个经济特别发达的区域，但是这个地区有四六○个企业和八十个建筑机构。伯力和莫斯科相隔数千公里，但是到现在为止，这些企业归三十二个部从远地管理，而改组后就由边疆区苏维埃执行委员会和将成立的国民经济委员会管理。在讨论中，代表们对共和国是否要保留一些部的问题提供了许多意见。塔吉克代表乌里查巴也夫主张取消加盟共和国的国家监察部，扩大全苏国家监察部的作用，监察人员和人民群众一起监察国民经济委员会的工作。乌克兰代表查谢德科反对保留联盟的专业部，认为专业部不会作出比国民经济委员会更有益的事情，像化学工业部等可以改变为国家计划委员会的一个司，这样将大大缩小编制。
    从讨论中大致可以看到新管理制度的优点。首先，新管理制度将大大减少管理层次，便于吸收群众参加管理，同时领导接近生产，能够就地及时解决问题。第二，地区以内的生产能力将能够得到合理的利用。第三，协作和专业化问题将更容易得到解决，如果说，过去协作只能在一个部内进行，现在协作的范围更广了。第四，许多过去被束缚在机关内的技术人员可以大量解放出来。乌克兰的代表就提出，共和国可以解放出三千五百名人员到生产中去。至于减少相向运输、互不通气等现象，那更是不用说了。
    代表们对如何实行改组以及怎样防止改组中可能产生的毛病，也踊跃地提出了意见。在干部问题上，列宁格勒代表科兹洛夫强调指出，细致地挑选国民经济委员会的干部是最重要的任务之一。应该把部里那些空闲下来的专家、党和经济工作中最优秀的那一部分积极分子，以及那些没有本位主义、官僚主义和保守主义的人调到国民经济委员会去工作。巴尔丁院士说：应当把智慧和经验而不是把人集中到国民经济委员会去，不然的话，将来不在莫斯科而在各个地方又会发现编制的臃肿。
    全苏工会中央理事会主席格里辛说：劳动者在全民讨论时对于改进工会工作提出了许多意见，他们的基本思想是保持按照生产专业组成工会的原则，加强共和国和地方的工会，使工会的领导接近于地方，这些问题将在最近理事会全会上解决。工会工作的缺点在于组织竞赛时较多注意优秀者而较少帮助落后者。专业部不很关心工厂行政方面怎样执行具体合同，这个问题在管理工业的新方式实行后将会解决。
