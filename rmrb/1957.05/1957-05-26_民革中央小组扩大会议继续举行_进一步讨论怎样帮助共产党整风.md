    Enlarged Meeting of the Central Committee Small Group of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee Continues
    Further Discussion on How to Help the Communist Party Rectify its Work Style
    (Our Newspaper News) The enlarged meeting of the Central Committee Small Group of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang continued on the morning of the 25th, further discussing how to help the Communist Party rectify its work style. More than 30 people attended, including the Chairman, Vice-Chairmen, Standing Committee members, and Central Committee members in Beijing. Six people, including Li Junlong, spoke at the meeting.
    Make Friends, Drop the Pretense, Look Forward
    Li Junlong Advocates Both Sides Taking Action to Demolish Walls and Fill Ditches
    Li Junlong first talked about the issue of how to demolish walls and fill ditches. He believes that from a developmental perspective, walls are getting lower every day, and ditches are getting narrower every day; however, walls and ditches still exist today. How to demolish walls and fill ditches? He proposed three methods: First, Party members should make friends with non-Party individuals. He disagreed with some people's opinion that "friend" is not an affectionate term and suggested changing it to "comrade." He said it depends on what kind of friend it is. There are critical friends, beneficial friends, and awe-inspiring friends. He believes that making friends is a two-way street. On the part of non-Party individuals, they should dare to speak and dare to criticize, rather than just nodding and agreeing. Second, drop the pretense. Some Party members have the airs of heroes, thinking that "the world was won by us," and that for democratic parties, "giving you a bowl of rice to eat" is enough, and they shouldn't meddle too much, keeping people at arm's length. As for non-Party individuals, he suggested they put down the airs of intellectuals, not be arrogant or look down on each other. Learn from each other's strengths, discard each other's weaknesses, and learn from each other, and the walls and ditches will disappear. Third, look forward. That is to say, Party members should focus on the progress of non-Party individuals and not just look at their past; non-Party individuals should also focus on today and tomorrow, and not just remember old grudges from the Three-Anti and Five-Anti campaigns. In this way, the distance between the two sides will be shortened.
    He said that some people worry that fully exposing contradictions will weaken the leadership of the Party, but it won't, on the contrary, it will consolidate the leadership of the Party. We must trust the Party, trust ourselves, we will not have any words that weaken the Party, and even less any actions that weaken the Party. In the rectification campaign, members of democratic parties should play the role of assistants, not be self-deprecating, nor just sing praises, but distinguish between right and wrong.
    In addition, he also put forward specific opinions on the hierarchical system, personnel system, and so on.
    Lu Yuwen Reminds Everyone:
    Distinguish Between Socialist Democracy and Bourgeois Democracy
    Be Vigilant Against Thoughts of Shaking off the Party's Leadership
    Lu Yuwen said, how to help the Communist Party rectify its work style? If we don't rectify ourselves now, and only help the leading Party rectify, it's easy to only see the shortcomings of others and not see our own shortcomings, and it's easy to be one-sided. Therefore, he reminded everyone that when making criticisms and suggestions, don't forget that we are engaged in socialist democracy. We must be vigilant when making suggestions, socialist democracy has just taken shape and is still advancing through exploration; while bourgeois democracy is deeply rooted in people's minds, and if we are not careful, it is easy to look at new things with old democratic views, which is not only useless but also harmful. He cited the example that recently, democrats have made many suggestions regarding the Party's leadership, such as how the Party group works in government organizations, changing the Party committee system in schools, withdrawing public representatives from joint ventures, the Party substituting for the government at the grassroots level, the joint issuance of instructions by the Party Central Committee and the State Council, and the 20-year fixed interest rate issue. Although these opinions seem to acknowledge the Party's leadership, they vaguely have the intention of shaking off the Party's leadership. He reminded everyone, let us not forget that we have raised our hands in favor of the Communist Party leading socialism, and us taking the socialist road!
    Criticizing Zhang Bojun's One Mistaken Viewpoint
    Next, he talked about another condition of socialism, which is the issue of democratic centralism. He said that Mr. Zhang Bojun believes that the State Council should not bring out finished products for everyone to discuss at meetings, saying that this is a formalistic meeting, which shocked him. He is the Assistant Secretary-General of the State Council. He said that he is a member who prepares for the State Council meetings and wants to produce finished products. When submitting a document from a department, he always asks clearly whether the minister has read it; if the document involves several departments, he asks whether they have discussed it, and strives to make the document mature before submitting it to the leaders. The higher the level to which it is submitted, the more it is hoped that the document will be prepared maturely, so as to avoid going through too many twists and turns. He said that even so, there are still many things that cannot be put on the agenda. Mr. Zhang Bojun does not allow finished products to be brought up, he hopes to have a big discussion and special discussion at the State Council meeting, you say one thing, I say another, and then vote, this is a bourgeois democratic method, which looks democratic on the surface, but in reality, it cannot achieve unity. He said that he cannot agree with Mr. Zhang Bojun's opinion. He believes that preparing the documents thoroughly through full consultation with all parties in advance, and then bringing them out for discussion and approval, is precisely the characteristic of socialist democracy, and its superiority.
    Then he talked about the issue of walls and ditches between the Party and non-Party individuals. He said that due to different job positions and different contacts, there are different feelings. He feels that there are no walls and ditches between Party members and him, he works, studies, plays chess, and plays poker with Party members, and does not feel that there is a wall, and he does not feel like an outsider. He said that this situation is not just his situation. He said, but from a general point of view, there are walls and ditches between the Party and non-Party individuals.
    He believes that it is necessary to demolish walls and fill ditches. However, he said, in any case, as long as there are parties, there will be boundaries, and it is impossible to have no boundaries at all. At the same time, he also agreed that Communist Party members should bear the main responsibility for demolishing walls and filling ditches, but he also believes that it must be demolished and filled from both sides. There is reason to demand that Communist Party members not be arrogant and not be stand-offish, and democrats should also demand that they not be self-deprecating and not be discouraged. It is required that Party members reach out first, but one cannot say that because one is a petty-bourgeois intellectual, and the other party does not reach out, then one will not reach out either. He said that one cannot demand that others accommodate one's shortcomings.
    If the Leading Party Makes Some Rebuttals
    It Cannot Be Considered Retaliation
    He said that recently, many democrats have spoken out freely and made suggestions to the Communist Party, and demanded guarantees that there would be no retaliation. He believes that in the course of speaking out freely, the opinions put forward are not necessarily all correct. Can we only allow ourselves to make suggestions to the leading Party, and not allow them to make explanations? If one day the leading Party makes explanations for some of the opinions we put forward, can this be considered picking on faults and retaliation?
    He believes that the more freedom of speech there is, the more the other party should be allowed to defend themselves. He said that if the opinions we put forward are in accordance with the facts and in accordance with reason, then they cannot be refuted, and what is there to fear of retaliation? If it is not in accordance with the facts and not in accordance with reason, then others criticizing us is a kind of help to us. Only allowing oneself to make suggestions and not allowing others to rebut is blocking the road to progress.
    How to Achieve Having a Post and Having Power?
    When talking about the issue of having a post and having power, he said that the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China put forward this issue as early as 1950, why is it still so serious now? He believes that some Communist Party members have sectarianism and underestimate the progress of democrats, which hinders its resolution, and this situation exists. However, if we only talk about sectarianism, we cannot solve the problem, and we need to better study its causes. He believes that the more important reason is that there is a problem with the national personnel arrangements. He analyzed three situations:
    First, people and positions do not match. He said, we can think carefully about whether someone is competent for a certain position? If they are not competent, have they delved into it in recent years? Have they changed from being an amateur to being a professional? If they were not competent in the past, and have not yet delved into it now, how can we ask them to have a post and have power?
    Second, one person holds multiple positions. He said that some people have countless positions, in the National People's Congress, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and government departments. They run around the streets in cars all day, and are exhausted, it is hard work, and they even fall asleep in meetings, how can they engage in business and achieve having a post and having power? He said that this situation also exists within the Communist Party, and sometimes lower-level cadres cannot even find the person in charge to sign off.
    Third, one position has multiple people. He said that some provinces have more than a dozen vice governors. I don't know how many assistants of various "chiefs" there are. At this year's National Archives Work Conference, someone reflected that the director of the general office has too many "mothers-in-law." When there is something to do, I don't know which vice governor to ask for instructions, so that I can respect the other party's authority. Sometimes work is urgent and there is no time to ask for instructions, so the director of the general office signs and issues it, and it is the director of the general office who has a post and has power. But this is also a helpless situation.
    Why are there problems with personnel arrangements? He believes that this is a contradiction between the united front viewpoint and the work viewpoint. Many personnel arrangements are not for work but for the united front.
    He believes that the united front viewpoint and the work viewpoint should not be contradictory in the first place, the united front is for work, for revolution, and for construction. However, if it is not arranged well, the work will suffer losses. He suggested that the relevant parties should study this issue carefully. He advocated that in the National People's Congress, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and other organizations, emphasis should be placed on the united front viewpoint, while in general government units, emphasis should be placed on the work viewpoint.
    Tan Tiwu Believes That Lu Yuwen's Words Are Not Sincere
    Gan Cisen Thinks That Tan Tiwu Is Too Subjective
    Tan Tiwu said in her speech that when helping the Communist Party with rectification, what attitude should members of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee adopt? She believes that it should be honest and sincere, without any falsehood, knowing everything and saying everything. Among comrades, let's have less of the old work style! She said that we must adhere to accepting the leadership of the working class and taking the socialist road, this premise must not be shaken, otherwise, it will not be today's democratic parties in China. She said that in order to have fewer twists and turns in socialism, things that hinder socialist construction must be reflected. Making suggestions does not necessarily mean not accepting leadership. To say that everything is caused by the bad socialist system is heresy.
    Tan Tiwu disagreed with Lu Yuwen's opinion. She believes that Lu Yuwen's opinion is not to help the Communist Party with rectification, Lu Yuwen said that there is no separation at all with Party members, that is not sincere words. She said that we must tell the truth. The leading Party should also pay attention when choosing people, and choose people who give loyal advice to the Party.
    She said that many problems with the relationship between the Party and non-Party individuals are often not because of the Communist Party, but are caused by shameless democrats. These people isolate the Party, isolate the masses, and take the opportunity to climb up.
    Gan Cisen spoke last. He said that we cannot think that Lu Yuwen's opinion is not sincere, Tan Tiwu is too subjective.
    He said that opinions such as the 20-year fixed interest rate are a manifestation of the bourgeoisie's insatiable greed.
    Then he talked about the issue of the Party substituting for the government. He said that there are three bad consequences of the Party substituting for the government, namely: 1. Reducing the Party's leading role. The Party was originally the leader and not the executor, and if it becomes the executor, it will inevitably reduce its leading role; 2. Harming the government's prestige; 3. Weakening the enthusiasm of the staff in the organization. Why is there a phenomenon of the Party substituting for the government? He believes that it is because some Party members only value the Party's instructions and do not value the government's instructions. The source of this idea is also related to the habits of the past revolutionary period. Regarding the issue of having a post but no power, he believes that some of Lu Yuwen's analysis is correct, but there are also other reasons that need to be studied.
    Liu Yaozhang and Chen Jianchen also spoke at the meeting.

### 民革中央小组扩大会议继续举行  进一步讨论怎样帮助共产党整风

    民革中央小组扩大会议继续举行
    进一步讨论怎样帮助共产党整风
    本报讯　25日上午，中国国民党革命委员会中央小组扩大会议继续举行，进一步讨论怎样帮助共产党整风。到会的有民革主席、副主席、常务委员和在京中央委员三十多人。会上发言的有李俊龙等六人。
    交朋友　丢架子　向前看
    李俊龙主张双方动手拆墙填沟
    李俊龙首先谈到如何拆墙填沟问题。他认为，从发展看来，墙是天天低、沟是天天窄的；但墙沟至今还有。如何拆墙填沟？他提出了三个办法：一是党员与非党人士交朋友。他不同意有人认为朋友是不亲切的称呼，而建议改称同志的意见。他说看是甚么样的朋友。有诤友、益友、畏友。他认为交朋友是两方面的，在非党人士方面，要敢说、敢诤，而不是唯唯诺诺。二是丢架子。有的党员有功臣架子，认为“天下是老子打下来的”，民主党派有工作，“给你碗饭吃”就行了，不要多管闲事，拒人于千里之外。至于非党人士，他提议要放下知识分子的架子，不要自高自大，和互相看不起。互取其长、互去其短，互相学习，墙沟便会消失的。三是向前看。就是说，对非党人士，党员要多看他们的进步，而不要光看他们的过去；非党人士也要多看今天、明天，有些人在三反、五反当中受了些委屈，也不要光记旧账。这样双方距离就会缩短。
    他说，有人担心充分揭露矛盾会不会削弱党的领导，不会的，相反会巩固党的领导。要相信党，相信自己，我们不会有削弱党的言论，更不会有削弱党的行动。在整风中，民主党派成员应当发挥助手作用，不要自卑，也不要只是歌功颂德，要分清是非。
    另外他对等级制度、人事制度等还提出了具体意见。
    卢郁文提醒大家：
    区别社会主义民主和资产阶级民主
    警惕摆脱党的领导的想法
    卢郁文说，怎样帮助共产党整风？现在自己不整风，光帮助领导党整风，提意见很容易只看到别人的缺点，看不见自己的缺点，很容易片面。因此，他提醒大家在提出批评和建议的时候，不要忘记我们是搞社会主义民主。我们提意见时要警惕，社会主义民主才刚刚形成，还是在摸索中前进；而资产阶级民主却在人们思想中根深蒂固，一不小心，很容易用旧民主观点来看新事物，这不但无益，而且有害。他举例说，最近民主人士对党的领导提了许多意见，如机关中党组如何工作，学校改变党委制，合营工厂中的公方代表撤出，基层以党代政，党中央和国务院联合发指示，以及定息二十年等问题。这些意见看来虽然承认党的领导，但恍恍忽忽又有摆脱党的领导的意思。他提醒说，我们不要忘记，共产党领导社会主义，我们走社会主义道路，这都是我们举了手的！
    批判章伯钧的一个错误观点
    接着他谈到社会主义的另一个条件，就是民主集中制问题。他说，章伯钧先生认为国务院开会不应拿出成品来让大家讨论，说这是形式主义的会议，这使他大吃一惊。他是国务院秘书长助理。他说，他是给国务院会议作准备工作的一员，是要搞成品的。在提出一个部的文件的时候，总要问清楚，部长看过了没有；如果文件牵涉到几个部，就要问清楚商量过没有，力求把文件搞得成熟再提给领导。越向高一级提出，越希望把文件准备成熟，免得费周折。他说，即使是这样，还有许多事情排不上议程。章伯钧先生不让把成品拿上去，他是希望在国务院会议上大讨论而特讨论，你说一通，我说一通，然后表决，这是资产阶级的民主方式，表面看来是民主的，实际上并不能取得一致。他说，章伯钧先生的这个意见我不能同意。他认为事先把文件经过各方充分协商，准备成熟，拿出来讨论通过，这正是社会主义民主的特点，是它的优越性。
    然后他谈到党与非党之间的墙和沟的问题。他说，由于工作岗位不同，接触人物不同，就有不同的感觉。他觉得党员同他之间没有墙和沟，他和党员一起工作、学习、下棋、打扑克，并没有感到有墙，自己也没有自外。他说，像这样的情况，不会是他一个人的情况。他说，不过从一般情况看来，党与非党之间是有墙和沟的。
    他认为必须拆墙填沟。但是，他说，无论如何，只要有党派，就会有界限的，完全没有界限，那是不可能的。同时，他也同意拆墙填沟共产党员应负主要责任，不过他也认为必须从两面拆、填。有理由要求共产党员不骄傲，不见外，民主人士也要要求自己不自卑、不自馁。要求党员先伸出手来，但不能以自己是小资产阶级知识分子，对方不伸手自己也不伸手。他说，不能要求人家迁就自己的毛病。
    领导党如果有所辩驳
    不能认为是打击报复
    他说，最近一个时期，许多民主人士大放大鸣，向共产党提出意见，并且要求保证不报复。他认为，大放大鸣中，所提出的意见不一定都是正确的。我们能不能只允许自己给领导党提意见，而不允许人家做说明？假如有一天领导党对我们提出的某些意见作说明解释，这能算是抓小辫子打击报复么？
    他认为，越是言论自由，越应该让对方辩解。他说，如果我们提出的意见合乎事实，合乎道理，那是驳不倒的，还怕报复么？如果不合乎事实，又不合乎道理，别人批驳，对我们是一种帮助。只允许自己提意见而不允许别人辩驳，这是自己堵塞进步之路。
    如何实现有职有权？
    在谈到有职有权问题的时候，他说，这个问题中共中央统战部在1950年就提出来了，为甚么到现在还这么严重？他认为，部分共产党员有宗派主义，对民主人士的进步估计不足，妨碍了它的解决，这种情况是存在的。但是，如果只说宗派主义，还不能解决问题，还需要更好地研究它的原因。他认为，更主要的原因是国家人事安排有问题。他分析了三种情况：
    第一，人与职不相称。他说，可以仔细想想，某人担任某职是否内行？如不是内行，这几年他钻进去了没有？是不是已经由外行变成了内行？如果过去不内行，现在又还没钻进去，这样叫他怎能实现有职有权？
    第二，一人多职。他说，有人有数不清的职务，人大、政协、政府部门都有职务。他们成天坐着汽车街上跑，疲于奔命，辛苦是辛苦了，开会还打瞌睡，这怎么让他搞业务，实现有职有权？他说，这种情况共产党内也有，有时下级干部找负责人签字都找不见。
    第三，一职多人。他说，有的省，副省长有十多个。各种“长”的助理不知有多少。今年举行的全国档案工作会议上有人反映，办公厅主任的“婆婆”太多。有事情不知要向哪位副省长请示，才算尊重了对方的职权。有时工作紧急，来不及请示了，办公厅主任就签发了，有职有权的是办公厅主任。但这也是无可奈何。
    为什么人事安排有问题？他认为这是统战观点和工作观点的矛盾。人事的安排有很多不是为了工作而是为了统战。
    他认为统战观点和工作观点本来不应有矛盾，统战就是为了工作，为了革命，为了建设。但是安排不好，工作就要受损失。他建议有关方面好好研究一下这个问题。他主张在人大、政协等机关，要着重从统战观点出发，而在一般机关单位，着重从工作观点出发。
    谭惕吾认为卢郁文话不由衷
    甘祠森觉得谭惕吾太主观了
    谭惕吾发言说，帮助共产党整风，民革成员应该采取甚么态度呢？她认为应该是老老实实，诚诚恳恳，不能有任何虚假，知无不言，言无不尽。同志中间，旧作风还是少来一点！她说，必须坚持接受工人阶级的领导，走社会主义道路，这前提，决不能动摇，否则就不是今天中国的民主党派了。她说，为了社会主义少些波折，对阻碍社会主义建设的事情，一定要反映出来。提意见，不一定就是不接受领导。说一切都是因社会主义制度不好而产生的，那是离经叛道。
    谭惕吾不同意卢郁文的意见。她认为卢郁文的意见不是帮助共产党整风，卢郁文说与党员毫无隔阂，那不是由衷之言。她说，我们要说真话。领导党选择人也要注意，要选对党进忠言的人。
    她说，很多党与非党的关系问题，常常不是因为共产党，而是由无耻的民主人士弄出来的。这些人隔离党，隔离群众，借机会向上爬。
    甘祠森最后发言。他说不能认为卢郁文的意见是话不由衷，谭惕吾是太主观了。
    他说，定息二十年一类的意见，是资产阶级贪得无厌的表现。
    随后他谈到以党代政的问题。他说，以党代政有三个不好的后果，就是一、降低党的领导作用。党原是领导者而不是执行者，如变成执行者，就必然降低领导作用；二、损害政府的威信；三、削弱机关工作人员的积极性。为甚么会有以党代政现象呢？他认为是由于有些党员只重视党的指示，而不重视政府指示。这种思想的来源又同过去革命时期的习惯有关。对有职无权的问题，他认为卢郁文的分析有些是对的，但也还有其他原因，需研究。
    刘瑶章和陈建晨也在会上作了发言。
