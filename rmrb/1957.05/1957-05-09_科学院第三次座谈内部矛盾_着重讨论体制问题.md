Reported by this newspaper: The symposium on correctly handling internal contradictions, held by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, concluded yesterday afternoon. The speeches at the meeting mainly focused on issues related to the Academy's system.

"Experimental science is a symbol of a nation's scientific level"

Chemists Liu Dagang and Yuan Hanqing both pointed out that the Academy of Sciences' neglect of experimental science is very serious. Yuan Hanqing said: "The development of science should focus on experimental science. Experimental science is a symbol of a nation's scientific level. Neglecting experimental science will affect the direction of scientific development." Our current experimental science is very poor, and its proportion to other sciences should be reconsidered.

Some institutions of the Academy of Sciences can be merged

The most opinions were raised regarding the organizational structure of the Academy of Sciences. Entomologist Zhu Hongfu said: The Academy of Sciences has swayed too much on systemic issues, and many organizational structures have changed repeatedly. Some institutions have been established, but it is not known what they should do, such as some members of the academic divisions, who themselves do not know what they should do. The leadership always thinks that more people are better, but in fact, too many levels are a hindrance, and many scientists who hold administrative leadership positions spend their time dealing with internal affairs. Liu Dagang also said that the instability of institutions is related to the dogmatic style of mechanically applying Soviet methods. Zoologist Shou Zhenhuang believes that the Academy of Sciences should not hope for comprehensive development, but should have a focus. It is neither possible nor necessary for the Academy of Sciences to concentrate the manpower and material resources of the national scientific community. He believes that the cooperation of various units within the Academy should also be considered. Many people believe that institutions that can be merged should be merged, which can not only solve some contradictions between the Academy of Sciences and higher education institutions and industrial departments, but also alleviate the contradictions of internal administrative personnel shortage, and the distribution of books, instruments, and equipment. Geophysicist Fu Chengyi believes that scientific research should first have points, and then naturally develop to lines, and should not require points and lines to be complete from the beginning. Automaton specialist Lu Yuanjiu has the same view. He said, to lead national scientific research, we must first gain a firm foothold ourselves. The preparatory committees for the four newly established research institutes last year, such as automation, are all short of manpower, and they have many similarities and few differences. He advocated merging them. Zhu Hongfu also raised a very important issue, namely: no one is in charge of the major issue of the promotion of scientific achievements. For example, an insecticide produced by the Institute of Entomology has high practical value, but no one is in charge of its promotion.

Relying solely on foreign instruments will make our country's science forever backward

Currently, all equipment for scientific research is purchased through the Ministry of Foreign Trade, which physicist Qian Linzhao believes is inappropriate. General equipment can be supplied by the Ministry of Foreign Trade, but the Ministry of Foreign Trade does not have the power to purchase many special and precise equipment, because what they can buy is limited to commodities. For example, the "helium" required by the Institute of Applied Physics has not been purchased. He suggested that the Equipment Bureau of the Academy of Sciences consider solving this problem themselves. Wang Dezhao, Director of the Equipment Bureau, and Xiao Lun, a radiochemist, both agreed with Qian Linzhao's opinion. Wang Dezhao also believes that an important reason for the current poor performance of equipment supply work is that the leadership underestimates this work, and the cultural level of the cadres assigned to equipment work is too low. Lu Yuanjiu said that since the promotion of streamlining and frugality, it has been found that many instruments purchased with foreign exchange can be manufactured domestically. At the same time, completely relying on buying instruments from foreign countries can only make our science forever behind others. We should consider establishing our own instrument industry to serve science.

"The academic atmosphere should be enlivened"

Physicist Zhang Wenyu said, I have a very deep feeling that our academic atmosphere is not strong. The main reason is that everyone does not talk about academics when they meet. This situation is even worse than when we were in Kunming during the Anti-Japanese War. "Talking about academic issues should become a part of scientists' lives." Discussions can cause controversy and deep thinking, which is of great benefit to scientific development. He said that the lack of discussion may also be related to secrecy, but I always believe that the academic atmosphere should be enlivened. Fu Chengyi believes that we now have a kind of "official air". It seems that the goal of researchers is to become directors, which is strange. The Academy of Sciences has also become a big yamen, and we don't know who is leading us. Xiao Lun said that respect for scientists should replace political treatment. Peng Qirui and others also criticized the extravagant and exaggerated style of some scientific workers, believing that "this is inconsistent with the spirit of scientific work."

Scientists Luo Changpei, Wu Zhonghua, Guo Musun, and Huang Wenxi also spoke at the meeting. In addition, scientists Zhang Zongshui and Bing Zhi submitted written opinions.

President Guo Moruo finally said that these three consecutive symposia have been very fruitful. Everyone exposed many contradictions in the work of the Academy of Sciences and also put forward many solutions to the contradictions. He stated that contradictions that can be resolved should be resolved as soon as possible, and conditions should be created for those that cannot be resolved immediately. The system of scientific work is a major issue, and the Academy of Sciences has established a special group to study it. He hopes that the practice of offering opinions to the leadership in such a cordial manner will be used more often and made regular and systematic in the future.

### 科学院第三次座谈内部矛盾  着重讨论体制问题

    科学院第三次座谈内部矛盾
    着重讨论体制问题
    本报讯　中国科学院召开的关于正确处理内部矛盾的座谈会，昨日下午结束。会上的发言，主要针对着同科学院体制有关的问题。
    “实验科学是国家科学水平的标志”
    化学家柳大纲和袁翰青都指出科学院对实验科学的忽视是十分严重的。袁翰青说：“科学发展应以实验科学为重点，实验科学是国家科学水平的标志，不重视实验科学将会影响科学发展的方向”；我们目前的实验科学十分可怜，它同其他科学的比例应该重新考虑。
    科学院有些机构可以合并
    对于科学院的组织机构问题大家提出的意见最多。昆虫学家朱弘复说：在体制问题上科学院摇摆得太厉害，不少组织机构变了再变。有些机构成立了，但不知道该做什么，如有些学部委员，他们自己也不知道该做什么。领导上总以为人多好办事，实际上层次多了反而碍事，许多担任行政领导的科学家将时间花费在处理内部事务上去了。柳大纲还说，机构的多变同机械搬用苏联办法的教条主义作风有关。动物学家寿振黄认为，科学院不应该希望全面发展，而应该有重点。科学院想集中全国科学界的人力物力既不可能也不必要。他认为院内部也应该考虑各单位的配合。不少人认为可以合并的机构应该加以合并，这样不但可以解决科学院同高等院校、产业部门之间的一些矛盾，内部的行政人员不足，图书、仪器、器材分配的矛盾也都可得以缓和。地球物理学家傅承义认为，科学研究应该先有点，然后自然地发展到线，不应该一开始就要求点线全备。自动学家陆元九也有同样看法。他说，我们要领导全国科学研究，先要自己站稳脚跟；去年新设立的自动学等四个研究所的筹备委员会，人力都很不足，而且他们相同的地方很多，不同的地方很少。他主张合并起来。朱弘复还提出了一个很值得重视的问题，即：科学成果的推广这样的大问题没有人管。如昆虫研究所制成的一种木材防腐剂，有很高的实用价值，但无人管它的推广问题。
    单纯依靠外国仪器会使我国科学永远落后
    目前，科学研究用的一切器材都通过对外贸易部去购买的办法，物理学家钱临昭认为不合适。一般的器材，可以由对外贸易部供应；但是许多特殊的、精密的器材，对外贸易部是无力量代买的，因为他们买得到的仅限于商品，如应用物理所要用的“氦”，就一直没有买到。他建议科学院器材局考虑自己解决这个问题。器材局局长汪德昭和放射化学家萧伦都同意钱临昭的意见。汪德昭并认为目前器材供应工作没做好的一个重要原因是领导上小看了这项工作，配备在器材工作方面的干部的文化水平太低。陆元九说，自从提倡精简节约以后，发现用外汇去买的许多仪器，国内是可以制造的。同时完全依靠去外国买仪器来用，只能使我们的科学永远落在人家的后头，应该考虑建立自己的为科学服务的仪器事业。
    “应该使学术空气活跃起来”
    物理学家张文裕说，我有一个很深刻的感觉，就是我们的学术空气不浓厚，主要的是大家见面不谈学术，这种情形甚至不及抗战时我们在昆明时的情况。“谈学术问题应该成为科学家的生活的一部分”，谈论能引起争论，引起深刻的思索，对科学发展有很大好处。他说，很少谈论恐怕和保密也有关系，但我总认为应该使学术空气活跃起来。傅承义认为，我们现在有一种“官气”，好像研究员努力的目标是做所长，这使人很奇怪。科学院也成了大衙门，谁领导我们也摸不清。萧伦说，应该用对科学家的尊重来代替政治待遇。彭琪瑞等对于一些科学工作者的铺张、浮夸的作风也提出了批评，认为“这是和科学工作的精神不一致的”。
    在会上发言的还有罗常培、吴仲华、郭慕荪、黄文熙等科学家，另有张宗燧和秉志两位科学家书面提了意见。
    郭沫若院长最后说，连续开的这三次座谈会很有收获，大家揭露了科学院工作中的许多矛盾，也提出了许多解决矛盾的办法。他表示：能解决的矛盾当尽快解决，不能立即解决的当努力创造条件。科学工作的体制是大问题，科学院已成立专门小组研究。他希望像这样亲切地给领导提意见的做法，今后用更多的方式使经常化、制度化。
