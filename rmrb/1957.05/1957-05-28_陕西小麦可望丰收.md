(Our Dispatch from Xi'an, May 27th) Shaanxi Province's more than 24 million mu of wheat are growing well, promising a bumper harvest. In the Guanzhong area, the main wheat-producing region, with the exception of some dry land, late-sown wheat, and wheat grown in rotation without fertilization that are growing poorly, the main crop wheat is generally growing well. Recently, the wheat has finished flowering and is now in the grain-filling stage. In the eastern part of the province, in areas such as Tongguan, Dali, and Chaoyi, where the wheat matures earlier, harvesting will begin at the end of this month; in the central part and along the Wei River, harvesting will generally begin in early June. The more than 1.7 million mu of wheat in the Hanzhong area are generally growing better than last year. The wheat in the Yan'an and Shangluo areas is also growing no worse than in previous years. The masses generally report that this year will be another year of bumper harvests.

According to preliminary estimates, the total wheat production in Shaanxi Province this year may be equal to the wheat production of the bumper harvest year of 1954 and higher than the total production of 1955; however, it may be slightly lower than the total production of 1956, which was a historically unprecedented bumper harvest. From a regional perspective, the wheat production in some areas of the Guanzhong Plain and the Hanzhong Basin this year may be higher than in 1956. For example, the more than 660,000 mu of wheat in Qianxian County are expected to achieve an average yield of 251 jin per mu, 10.5% higher than in 1956. In Wugong County, which has historically achieved high wheat yields, the 320,000 mu of wheat are expected to have an average yield of 300 jin per mu this year. Furthermore, looking at the estimated yields per mu in various places, the highest is the China-Soviet Friendship Agricultural Cooperative in Yao Ning Township, Huayin County. The 1,020 mu of wheat grown in rotation by this cooperative are expected to have an average yield of 465 jin per mu. The more than 3,700 mu of wheat (of which 95% is grown in rotation) in the Qianjin Agricultural Cooperative in Huayuan Village, Chang'an County, can also produce an average of more than 412 jin per mu, which is more than 13 jin per mu higher than the average yield in 1956.

### 陕西小麦可望丰收

    陕西小麦可望丰收
    本报西安27日电　陕西省的两千四百多万亩小麦生长良好，丰收在望。小麦主要产地的关中地区，除部分旱地，播种晚和未施肥的回茬小麦长得较差外，正茬小麦普遍生长良好。最近，小麦扬花期已过，正在灌浆升颗。东部小麦成熟较早的潼关、大荔、朝邑一带，将在本月底开始搭镰；中部和渭河两岸地区，也将在6月上旬普遍展开收割。汉中专区的一百七十多万亩小麦，普遍比去年长得好。延安和商雒地区的小麦，长得也不比往年差。群众普遍反映，今年还是一个丰收年。
    据初步测算，陕西省今年小麦的总产量约可等于1954年大丰收的小麦产量，并高出1955年的总产量；但较历史上空前大丰收的1956年的总产量，可能稍低一些，从地区来看，关中平原和汉中盆地的部分地区，今年的小麦产量可高于1956年。如乾县的六十六万多亩小麦，平均亩产量可达到二百五十一斤，高出1956年10.5％。历年获得小麦丰产的武功县，今年三十二万多亩小麦，预计每亩平均产量为三百斤。再从各地预计亩产量来看，以华阴县姚宁乡的中苏友好农业社为最高。这个社的一千零二十亩回茬麦，预计每亩平均产量可达到四百六十五斤。长安县花园村前进农业社的三千七百多亩小麦（其中回茬麦占95％），平均每亩也能产到四百一十二斤多，比1956年每亩平均产量还高出十三斤多。
