(Our Newspaper) Beijing News: The famous Peking Opera actress Yu Lianquan (Xiao Cuihua) performed "Ma Siyuan" at a party last night. This old play, which was only recently unbanned, will meet the audience on the Beijing stage in the coming days.

"Ma Siyuan" is one of Xiao Cuihua's masterpieces, and it has been silent on the stage for nearly twenty years. This play tells the true story of a sensational case in Beijing during the late Qing Dynasty. Xiao Cuihua plays Zhao Yu, a harlot. The body movements and expressions usually avoided by female characters, such as looking up, sticking out the chest, taking large steps, swaying the hips, and rolling the eyes, are all performed in this role. This excellent performing artist vividly portrays this bold and vicious female rogue in the play.

The veteran artists Lei Xifu, Wang Fushan, Gao Fuyuan, Yu Yongli, and the famous veteran artist Li Hongchun, who have been away from the stage for decades, participated in the performance of this "group play." Tian Xixiu, a young actor appreciated by Xiao Cuihua, played the adulterer Jia Ming.

After the party, Qian Junrui and Xia Yan, vice ministers of the Ministry of Culture, as well as famous actors Ye Shenglan, Du Jinfang, and Xin Fengxia, went backstage to see Xiao Cuihua and congratulate him on his performance.

    本报讯　京剧著名花旦于连泉（筱翠花）昨天在一个晚会上演出了“马思远”。这个解禁才两天的老戏，日内将在北京舞台上同观众见面。
   “马思远”是筱翠花的拿手杰作之一，绝响于舞台已近二十年。这个戏写的是清末在北京轰动一时的一桩奇案，真人真事。筱翠花在戏里饰演荡妇赵玉，旦角身上忌讳的仰脸、挺胸、大步、活胯、翻眼看人等身段、眼神，在这个角色中都有表演。这位优秀的表演艺术家在戏中把这个泼辣、狠毒的女流氓，表演得淋漓尽致。
    息影舞台数十年的老艺人雷喜福、王福山、高富远、于永利以及著名老艺人李洪春等参加了这出“群戏”的演出。饰演奸夫贾明的，是得到筱翠花赏识的青年演员田喜秀。
