Reconstruction of Munan Pass Tower

The Munan Pass gate and tower, the southern gateway of the motherland, are being rebuilt. Construction workers from Shanghai, Guilin, and other places are working hard in the heat, and it is expected to be completed by the end of July.

The new city gate is more magnificent than the old one. The city tower has three floors, each of which can hold a social dance or accommodate dozens of people for a banquet. There are stone stairs with carved railings on both sides of the tower for tourists to go up and down.

Munan Pass is located in the southwest of Pingxiang City, Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture, Guangxi Province. It is strategically important and has beautiful scenery. The Xiang-Gui Railway and the Vietnam Hanoi-Munan Pass Railway connect here.

    改建睦南关城楼
    祖国南大门的睦南关城门和城楼正在改建。来自上海、桂林等地的建筑工人正在冒着炎热赶工，预计7月底可以全部完工。
    新的城门比旧城门更加雄伟。城楼有三层，每层都可以举行联欢舞会或容纳数十人的宴会。城楼两边有雕花栏杆的石梯，可供游人上下。
    睦南关位于广西省桂西僮族自治州凭祥市西南部，形势险要，风景优美，湘桂铁路和越南河内—睦南关铁路在这里接轨。
