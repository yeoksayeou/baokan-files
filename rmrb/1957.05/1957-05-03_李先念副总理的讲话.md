    Today is the tenth anniversary of the establishment of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. This is a major event in the political life of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and the people of all ethnic groups in our country. We are very happy to be able to come to Hohhot and celebrate this festival with the people of all ethnic groups in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. On behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao Zedong, I would like to extend my heartfelt and warm congratulations to the Mongolian people and the people of all ethnic groups in the autonomous region.
    The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is the earliest established, largest in scale, and fastest-growing ethnic autonomous region in our country. It has played and will continue to play an important role in the cause of the unity of our great motherland and the unity of all ethnic groups. On the occasion of its tenth anniversary, summarizing its basic experiences from the achievements it has made in various aspects is undoubtedly of great significance to the common cause of the Mongolian people and all ethnic groups in our country.
    The Mongolian people of Inner Mongolia are a diligent, brave, and historically long-standing ethnic group in our country. Since ancient times, they have developed economic ties and cultural exchanges with all ethnic groups in the country, and have made important contributions to the creation of our great motherland. The Mongolian people were once one of the strong ethnic groups in our country, but in the past century, under the cruel oppression and exploitation of imperialism, the domestic reactionary ruling class, and feudal forces within the ethnic group, the Mongolian people suffered very serious damage. In order to resist national oppression and strive for national liberation, the Mongolian people have carried out a long and heroic struggle. After the founding of the Communist Party of China, it pointed out the direction for the revolutionary struggle of the Mongolian people and other ethnic groups in the Inner Mongolia region, and practically led the liberation movement of the Mongolian people. As early as the First and Second Revolutionary Civil Wars, the Communist Party of China led the Mongolian and Han revolutionary youths and working people in the Inner Mongolia region to oppose the reactionary rulers at that time, and cultivated a group of revolutionary backbones for the Mongolian people. During the Anti-Japanese War, it organized and led the Anti-Japanese struggle in the Inner Mongolia region, established the Anti-Japanese base area in the Daqing Mountains, and continued to train a group of Mongolian revolutionary cadres at the Yan'an Nationalities Institute. During the Third Revolutionary Civil War, it led the people of all ethnic groups in the Inner Mongolia region in the struggle against the Kuomintang reactionaries, launched the autonomous movement of the Mongolian people, and established the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Government headed by Comrade Ulanhu on May 1, 1947.
    The liberation movement of the Mongolian people gradually developed and grew along with the development and growth of the national people's great revolutionary movement led by the Communist Party of China through a series of arduous struggles. The growth and development of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is also the same. When the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region was established, it was precisely during the period when the great liberation war of the motherland was in full swing. It actively led the Mongolian people and other ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia to support and participate in the national people's liberation war. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region was a participating unit in the first session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and made a glorious contribution to the founding of the People's Republic of China. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, with the development of China's revolution and construction and the advancement of various tasks in the autonomous region, and under the gradually mature conditions, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region gradually formed today's autonomous region centered on Hohhot, with an area of more than 1.4 million square kilometers and a population of more than 8.7 million, and achieved remarkable achievements in the nationalization of autonomous organs. This has forever ended the situation in which the Mongolian people in the Inner Mongolia region had been divided for a long time, thoroughly realized the unified regional autonomy policy for the Mongolian people in the Inner Mongolia region advocated by the Communist Party of China and Comrade Mao Zedong, and created very favorable conditions for the future development of the Mongolian people and all ethnic groups in the autonomous region.
    While gradually implementing regional autonomy, and in combination with the characteristics of the ethnic groups and regions, the autonomous region smoothly completed the democratic reform and abolished the feudal system. In the past two or three years, and under the situation of the upsurge of the national socialist revolution, it has achieved a decisive victory in socialist transformation and basically established the socialist system within the autonomous region. Now, 96% of the farmers in the region have joined agricultural production cooperatives; capitalist industry and commerce have all been transformed into joint state-private enterprises; and the socialist transformation of animal husbandry is also being gradually carried out on the basis of stable production. At present, 83% of the herdsmen have joined pastoral production cooperatives and various types of mutual aid groups. This has opened up broad avenues for the development of social productive forces and the socialist construction in the autonomous region.
    According to the actual conditions of the autonomous region, the autonomous region's people's government has vigorously led the restoration and construction of the economy and culture in the entire region. Over the past ten years, through the hard work of the people of all ethnic groups and the strong support of the state, the economic and cultural construction undertakings of the autonomous region have undergone tremendous development. Compared with 1946, the total industrial output value of the region has increased by 27 times; the total grain output has increased by one and a half times; the number of large and small livestock has increased by more than two times; the sales volume of state-owned and cooperative commercial commodities has increased by ten times; the number of schools has increased by 4.7 times; and the number of medical and health institutions has increased by 37 times. With the development of economic and cultural construction undertakings, the material and cultural life of the people of all ethnic groups has also been significantly improved. Due to the vigorous development of various construction undertakings in the autonomous region, over the past ten years, especially in recent years, the autonomous region has not only supplied a large number of livestock, timber, and grain to the people of all ethnic groups in the country, but also participated in the state's key industrial construction in the autonomous region with huge manpower, material resources, and financial resources, thereby providing strong support for the construction undertakings of the motherland.
    In the process of promoting regional autonomy, carrying out democratic reforms, and engaging in economic and cultural construction, true equality in ethnic status and all powers has been realized among all fraternal ethnic groups in the autonomous region, and a new ethnic relationship of equality, unity, mutual assistance, and cooperation has been established and developed. The unity within the Mongolian people has also been unprecedentedly strengthened. With the basic victory of socialist transformation in the autonomous region, this new relationship between ethnic groups has been further developed into a socialist ethnic relationship. And such an ethnic relationship is precisely a reliable foundation for further developing the political, economic, and cultural construction undertakings of the autonomous region. All these achievements show that the political, economic, and cultural outlook of the Mongolian people and other ethnic groups in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has undergone tremendous and profound changes; indicating that the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has provided a good example for all ethnic autonomous regions in our country in implementing regional autonomy, carrying out social reforms, developing the economy and culture, and handling ethnic relations. The people of all ethnic groups in our country have reason to be delighted and encouraged by the achievements made by Inner Mongolia.
    The acquisition of all these achievements in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is the result of the hard work of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China headed by Comrade Ulanhu and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Committee under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao Zedong, uniting the cadres of all ethnic groups and people of all strata in the autonomous region; it is also the result of the active support of the Han people and the people of all ethnic groups in the country. The peaceful liberation of the Suiyuan area and the inclusion of Suiyuan Province into the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region also provided favorable conditions for the formation and development of a unified Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. I would like to take this opportunity to convey the care and greetings of the Communist Party of China, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao Zedong to the cadres and people of all strata of the Mongolian people in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and to the cadres and people of the Han and other ethnic groups in the autonomous region.
    The path that the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has traveled in the past ten years is a broad road that all ethnic autonomous regions in our country should go through. The several basic experiences it has gained have universal significance for the people of all ethnic groups and all ethnic autonomous regions in our country. These basic experiences are:
    First, we must firmly stand within the big family of the motherland and strengthen the unity between ethnic groups and within ethnic groups. In the past, the Mongolian people united with all ethnic groups in our country to jointly overthrow the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and achieved the liberation of their own ethnic group. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Mongolian people united with all ethnic groups in our country to jointly achieve a decisive victory in socialist transformation, and through the path of regional autonomy, realized the right to be masters of their own affairs and developed their own ethnic group according to their own circumstances and characteristics. The experiences of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and other ethnic autonomous regions in the country show that only by uniting within the unified big family of the motherland and correctly implementing the policy of ethnic regional autonomy can the people of all ethnic groups obtain the thorough liberation and development of their own ethnic groups while developing the common cause of all ethnic groups.
    Second, it is necessary to carry out necessary social reforms within the ethnic group. In addition, the existence of class relations and the system of exploitation within the ethnic group hinders the development of social productive forces and hinders the progress and thorough liberation of the ethnic group. Only through reform can social productive forces and the ethnic group be thoroughly liberated. However, social reforms in ethnic areas must be closely integrated with the characteristics of local social and economic development and various construction conditions, and strive for policies and steps that are suitable for the specific local conditions, in order to smoothly complete the task of reform.
    Third, it is necessary to vigorously develop economic and cultural construction undertakings according to local construction conditions. The construction of ethnic minority areas is an integral part of the national socialist construction, and at the same time, it is directly related to the vital interests of the ethnic minority people. Therefore, it must be subordinate to the overall interests of national construction, and at the same time, it must appropriately take care of the special needs of ethnic minorities and the urgent demands of ethnic minority people. The development of construction undertakings in ethnic minority areas must rely on the hard work of the ethnic minority people themselves, and at the same time, it must have the strong assistance of the state and the people of all ethnic groups. It is wrong to ignore either aspect.
    Fourth, it is necessary to unswervingly strengthen the leadership of the Communist Party of China and vigorously cultivate ethnic minority cadres, especially ethnic cadres with communist ideas. The Communist Party of China is the political party of the working class with Marxism-Leninism as its guiding ideology. Only such a political party can solve domestic ethnic problems with a thorough spirit of democracy and ethnic equality. Without the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the ethnic minority people cannot be thoroughly liberated. And ethnic cadres, especially communist ethnic cadres, are indispensable bridges for making the Party's policies penetrate into the ethnic minority masses. Without a large number of communist ethnic cadres, ethnic problems cannot be truly resolved.
    What guiding principles should the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region follow in its continued progress in the future? That is: in the common cause of building a great socialist motherland, further strengthen the unity between ethnic groups and within ethnic groups, give full play to the enthusiasm and initiative of the people of all ethnic groups, and build a socialist Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
    In order to achieve such a great goal, the primary task at present is to consolidate the socialist system. Our socialist system has only just been established. We know that the establishment of any new system requires a considerable amount of hard work to consolidate it. Therefore, we must further consolidate the achievements of socialist transformation from the organizational and ideological aspects, and continue to complete the socialist transformation of agriculture, animal husbandry, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce. Only by establishing a solid socialist system can we provide a fundamental guarantee for the high-level development of the economy and culture of all ethnic groups in the autonomous region.
    Secondly, we must vigorously develop economic and cultural construction undertakings. Developing industry is of paramount importance to building a socialist Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Therefore, the autonomous region must use greater efforts to develop local industries and support the state's key industrial construction in the autonomous region, so as to rapidly improve the industrial production level of the autonomous region. While developing industry, we must continue to work hard to develop agriculture, animal husbandry, forestry, and other economies, and correspondingly develop socialist and ethnic cultural education undertakings. The state's assistance to the construction undertakings of the autonomous region in the past was still insufficient due to the limitations of conditions, and it must be strengthened in the future.
    Strengthening and consolidating ethnic unity remains a major task of the autonomous region. We have already said before that the ethnic relations of the autonomous region have developed into socialist ethnic relations. However, we must also see that ethnic problems, that is, ethnic relations problems, still exist; and because of the development of socialist undertakings, the relationship between members of all ethnic groups working and living together will also develop day by day, which brings new problems, requiring us not to relax but to strengthen education on ethnic unity to the people of all ethnic groups, especially the Mongolian and Han people, to make them understand the important significance of ethnic unity, so that they can live and work together based on the principles of equality and mutual benefit, mutual cooperation, mutual respect, mutual concessions, mutual trust, and common development. As long as we can do this, our ethnic relations will surely reach complete mutual trust and seamless unity.
    Strengthening the leadership and ideological work of the Communist Party of China is of extremely great significance for the further development of the autonomous region. It is necessary to further improve the Marxist-Leninist level of all cadres, help them learn to correctly handle contradictions among the people, prevent and overcome bureaucracy, subjectivism, great Han chauvinism, and local nationalism, carry forward the fine tradition of hard work, closely connect with the masses, and wholeheartedly serve the people of all ethnic groups.
    Comrades! The tasks to be completed by the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are very glorious and arduous, and there are also many difficulties on the road ahead. However, with the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao Zedong, with the foundation of ten years of work, and with favorable conditions in all aspects, as long as we unite as one, be modest and prudent, and carry forward the spirit of building the country through diligence and thrift, we will surely be able to build a socialist Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
    We hope that the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region will continue to be a good example for the construction and development of ethnic autonomous regions in our country!

    李先念副总理的讲话
    今天是内蒙古自治区成立十周年纪念日。这是内蒙古自治区和我国各民族人民政治生活中的一件大事。我们能够来到呼和浩特和内蒙古自治区各民族人民一起庆祝这个节日，感到非常高兴。我谨代表中国共产党中央委员会、中央人民政府和毛泽东主席向蒙古民族和自治区内各民族人民致以衷心的、热烈的祝贺。
    内蒙古自治区是我国建立最早、规模最大、发展很快的民族自治地方，在我们伟大祖国的统一和各民族团结的事业中曾经起过并将继续发挥重要的作用。在它成立十周年的时候，从它在各方面所取得的成就，总结它的基本经验，对蒙古民族和我国各民族的共同事业，无疑地有着重要的意义。
    内蒙古的蒙古民族是我国勤劳、勇敢和具有悠久历史的民族，很早以来，就和国内各民族发展了经济上的联系和文化上的交流，对我们伟大祖国的缔造曾经有过重要的贡献。蒙古民族在历史上曾经是我国强盛民族之一，但是，近百年来，在帝国主义、国内反动统治阶级和民族内部封建势力的残酷的压迫和剥削下，给蒙古民族带来了十分严重的损害。为了反抗民族压迫，争取民族解放，蒙古民族曾经进行了长期的英勇的斗争。中国共产党成立以后，给内蒙古地区的蒙古民族和其他各民族人民的革命斗争指出了方向，并实际领导了蒙古民族的解放运动。远在第一、二次国内革命战争时期，中国共产党即领导内蒙古地区的蒙汉革命青年和劳动人民，反对了当时的反动统治者，并且为蒙古民族培养了一批革命骨干；抗日战争时期，组织与领导了内蒙古地区的抗日斗争，建立了大青山一带的抗日根据地，并且在延安民族学院继续培养了一批蒙古族的革命干部。第三次国内革命战争时期，领导内蒙古地区各民族人民进行了反对国民党反动派的斗争，开展了蒙古民族的自治运动，并且在1947年5月1日成立了以乌兰夫同志为首的内蒙古自治区人民政府。
    蒙古民族的解放运动是随着中国共产党所领导的全国人民大革命运动的发展和壮大，经过一系列的艰苦斗争，才逐渐发展和壮大起来的。内蒙古自治区的成长和发展也是这样。内蒙古自治区成立的时候，正是祖国伟大的解放战争激烈进行的时期，它积极地领导了内蒙古蒙古民族和其他各民族人民支援和参加了全国人民的解放战争。内蒙古自治区是中国人民政治协商会议第一届会议的参加单位，对中华人民共和国的成立尽了光荣的责任。中华人民共和国成立以后，随着中国革命和建设事业的发展，和自治区内各项工作的推进，在条件逐步成熟的情况下，内蒙古自治区逐渐形成了今天的以呼和浩特为中心，面积达一百四十多万平方公里，人口在八百七十万以上的自治地方，并且在自治机关的民族化方面获得了显著成绩。这样，就永远结束了长时期以来内蒙古地区蒙古民族被分割的局面，彻底实现了中国共产党和毛泽东同志所主张的统一的内蒙古地区蒙古民族区域自治的方针，并为蒙古民族和自治区内各民族今后的发展创造了十分有利的条件。
    在逐步推行区域自治的同时，结合民族和地区的特点，自治区顺利完成了民主改革，废除了封建制度；近两三年来，并且在全国社会主义革命高潮的形势下，取得了社会主义改造的决定性的胜利，基本上确立了自治区内的社会主义制度。现在，全区已有96％的农户参加了农业生产合作社；资本主义工商业已经全部改造为公私合营企业；对畜牧业的社会主义改造也正在稳定发展生产的基础上逐步进行，目前已有83％的牧户参加了牧业生产合作社和各种类型的互助组。这样，就为自治区社会生产力的发展和社会主义建设的进行开辟了广阔的道路。
    根据自治区的现实条件，自治区人民政府大力领导了全区的经济、文化的恢复与建设工作。十年来，经过各民族人民的辛勤劳动和国家的有力支援，自治区的各项经济、文化建设事业，已经有了巨大的发展。以1956年同1946年比较，全区工业总产值增长了二十七倍；粮食总产量增长了一倍半；大小牲畜头数增长了两倍多；国营和合作社营商业商品销售量增长了十倍；学校增长了四点七倍；医疗卫生机构增长了三十七倍。随着经济、文化建设事业的发展，各民族人民的物质、文化生活也有了显著的改善。由于自治区各项建设事业的蓬勃发展，十年来特别是近几年来，自治区不仅以大量的牲畜、木材和粮食供应了全国各民族人民，而且以巨大的人力、物力和财力参加了国家在自治区内的重点工业建设，从而对祖国的建设事业提供了有力的支援。
    在推行区域自治，进行民主改革和经济、文化建设的过程中，自治区内各兄弟民族之间真正实现了民族地位和一切权力方面的平等，建立与发展了平等、团结、互助、合作的新的民族关系。蒙古民族内部的团结也空前地加强了。随着自治区内社会主义改造的基本胜利，这种民族之间的新的关系并且更进一步地发展成为社会主义的民族关系了。而这样的民族关系正是进一步发展自治区的政治、经济和文化建设事业的可靠的基础。所有这些成就，表明内蒙古自治区蒙古民族和其他各民族人民的政治、经济、文化面貌已经发生了巨大的、深刻的变化；表明内蒙古自治区在实行区域自治、进行社会改革、发展经济、文化和处理民族关系方面，已经为我国各民族自治地方提供了一个良好的榜样。我国各民族人民有理由为内蒙古所取得的各项成就而欢欣鼓舞。
    内蒙古自治区所有这些成就的获得是以乌兰夫同志为首的中国共产党内蒙古自治区委员会和内蒙古自治区人民委员会在中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛泽东主席的正确领导下，团结自治区内各民族干部和各阶层人民艰苦努力的结果；也是汉族人民和全国各民族人民积极支援的结果；绥远地区的和平解放和绥远省的划入内蒙古自治区，对统一的内蒙古自治区的形成和发展也提供了有利的条件。我愿意借此机会转达中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛泽东主席对内蒙古自治区蒙古民族的干部和各阶层人民、对自治区内的汉族和其他各民族的干部和人民的关怀和慰问。
    内蒙古自治区十年来所走过的道路，是我国各民族自治地方都应该经历的一条康庄大道，它所取得的几点基本经验，对我国各民族人民和各民族自治地方有着普遍的意义。这些基本经验是：
    第一，必须坚决地站在祖国大家庭之内，加强各民族之间及民族内部的团结。蒙古民族过去曾经与我国各民族团结一致共同推翻了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的统治，并且取得了本民族的解放。中华人民共和国成立以后，蒙古民族又与我国各民族团结一致共同取得了社会主义改造的决定性的胜利，并且通过区域自治的道路，实现了当家作主的权利，按照自己的情况和特点发展了自己的民族。内蒙古自治区和全国其他各民族自治地方的经验都表明，我国各族人民只有团结在统一祖国大家庭之内，正确贯彻民族区域自治政策，才能够在各民族共同事业的发展中同时获得自己民族的彻底解放和发展。
    第二，必须在民族内部实行必要的社会改革。另外民族内部阶级关系和剥削制度的存在，阻碍着社会生产力的发展，阻碍着民族的进步和彻底的解放；只有经过改革，才能使社会生产力和民族得到彻底解放。但是，民族地区的社会改革必须密切地结合着当地社会经济发展的特点和各种建设条件，争取适合于当地具体情况的方针政策和步骤，才能顺利地完成改革的任务。
    第三，必须根据当地的建设条件，大力发展经济、文化的建设事业。少数民族地区的建设是国家社会主义建设的一个组成部分，同时又直接关系到少数民族人民的切身利益。因此，它必须服从国家建设的整体利益，同时又必须适当照顾少数民族的特殊需要和少数民族人民当前的迫切要求。少数民族地区建设事业的发展，必须依靠少数民族人民自己的辛勤努力，同时又必须有国家和各民族人民的大力帮助，忽视任何一个方面都是不对的。
    第四，必须始终不渝地加强中国共产党的领导，并大力培养少数民族干部、特别是具有共产主义思想的民族干部。中国共产党是以马克思列宁主义为指导思想的工人阶级的政党，只有这样的政党才能以彻底的民主主义精神和民族平等的精神解决国内的民族问题，离开中国共产党的领导，少数民族人民就不可能得到彻底的解放。而民族干部、特别是共产主义的民族干部是使党的政策深入到少数民族群众中去的不可缺少的桥梁，没有大批的共产主义的民族干部，民族问题也就不可能得到真正的解决。
    今后内蒙古自治区应该遵循什么方针继续前进呢？这就是：在建设伟大的社会主义祖国的共同事业中，更进一步加强民族之间和民族内部的团结，充分发挥各民族人民的积极性和主动精神，建设社会主义的内蒙古自治区。
    为了实现这样一个伟大的目的，当前首要的任务就是巩固社会主义制度。我们的社会主义制度才刚刚确立。我们知道，任何新制度的建立，都需要相当时间的艰苦工作，才能巩固下来的。因此，我们必须进一步从组织上、思想上巩固社会主义改造的成果，并继续完成对农业、牧业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造。只有确立起巩固的社会主义制度，才能为自治区内各民族经济、文化的高度发展提供根本的保证。
    其次，必须大力发展经济、文化的建设事业。发展工业对建设社会主义的内蒙古自治区具有头等重要的意义。因此，自治区必须用更大的力量发展地方工业和支援国家在自治区内的重点工业建设，以便迅速提高自治区的工业生产水平。在发展工业的同时，还必须继续努力发展农业、牧业、林业和其它经济，并相应地发展社会主义的、民族的文化教育事业。国家过去对自治区建设事业的帮助，由于条件的限制还是不够的，今后也必须予以加强。
    加强和巩固民族团结仍然是自治区的重大任务，我们在前面已经说过，自治区的民族关系已经发展成为社会主义的民族关系了。但是，我们还必须看到，民族问题也就是民族关系问题还是存在的；而且由于社会主义事业的发展，各民族成员之间共同劳动，共同生活的关系也会日益发展，这就带来了新的问题，要求我们不是放松而是更加加强对各民族人民、特别是对蒙汉两族人民进行关于民族团结的教育，使他们懂得民族团结的重要意义，使他们能够根据平等互利、互相合作、互相尊重、互相让步、互相信任、共同发展原则共处共事。只要我们能够这样作，我们的民族关系就一定能够达到彼此完全信任，团结无间。
    加强中国共产党的领导和思想工作，对于自治区的进一步发展有着极其重大的意义。必须进一步提高全体干部的马克思列宁主义水平，帮助他们学会正确地处理人民内部的矛盾，防止和克服官僚主义、主观主义和大民族主义、地方民族主义，发扬艰苦奋斗的优良传统，密切地联系群众，全心全意地为各民族人民服务。
    同志们！内蒙古自治区所要完成的任务是十分光荣而又艰巨的，在前进的道路上，困难也是很多的。但是，有中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛泽东主席的英明领导，有十年工作的基础，有各方面有利条件，只要我们团结一致，谦虚谨慎，发扬勤俭建国的精神，我们就一定能够建设成社会主义的内蒙古自治区。
    我们希望内蒙古自治区继续成为我国各民族自治地方建设与发展的良好榜样！
