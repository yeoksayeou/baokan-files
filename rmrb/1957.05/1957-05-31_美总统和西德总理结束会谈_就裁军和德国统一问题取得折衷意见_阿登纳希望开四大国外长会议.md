Xinhua News Agency report: West German Chancellor Adenauer and US President Eisenhower issued a joint communiqué on the 28th after three days of secret talks.

The communiqué indicates that they reached a compromise on the "linkage issue" between disarmament and German unification. This involves placing the discussion of German unification between the achievement of a "preliminary disarmament agreement" and a "comprehensive disarmament agreement."

The communiqué states: If "preliminary" disarmament steps are successful, then a "comprehensive disarmament agreement" should be reached after "a considerable period," but this "comprehensive" agreement must take the resolution of the German unification issue as a "precondition."

The communiqué states: The West German side believes that the conclusion of this "preliminary disarmament agreement" may be a "suitable opportunity" to convene a Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference to discuss the issue of German unification. In this regard, Eisenhower and Adenauer reiterated in the communiqué their policy of restoring German unification through so-called "free elections."

The communiqué also states: They believe that the strength of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization must be "further strengthened." West Germany will "begin to establish" an army "as soon as possible." The United States intends to continue to "station troops" in Europe, including in West Germany. The two governments reiterated that the NATO forces must be able to "use all available means," including the "most modern" weapons.

Adenauer said at a press conference held after the publication of his joint communiqué with Eisenhower that he expected to hold a Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference. The current talks on disarmament will not affect West Germany's rearmament plan. The West German army being established will be equipped with the finest and most modern weapons available.

    美总统和西德总理结束会谈
    就裁军和德国统一问题取得折衷意见
    阿登纳希望开四大国外长会议
    据新华社讯　西德总理阿登纳和美国总统艾森豪威尔经过了三天秘密会谈后，在28日发表会谈公报。
    公报表明，他们在裁军和德国统一问题这两者的“联系问题”上达成了一种折衷意见。这就是把德国统一问题的讨论放在达成“初步裁军协议”和“全面裁军协议”的中间。
    公报说：如果“初步的”裁军步骤获得成功，那末经过“一个相当的期间后”就应该达成“全面裁军协议”，但是这种“全面”协议一定要以德国统一问题的解决作为“先决条件”。
    公报说：西德方面认为，这种“初步裁军协定”的缔结可能成为召开四大国外长会议来讨论德国统一问题的“适当时机”。在这一方面，艾森豪威尔和阿登纳在公报中又重申了他们通过所谓“自由选举”来恢复德国统一的政策。
    公报还说：他们认为：必须“进一步加强”北大西洋集团的力量。西德将“尽快地着手建立”军队。美国打算继续在欧洲，包括在西德“驻扎军队”。两国政府重申：北大西洋集团军队必须能够“利用一切可以利用的手段”，包括“最现代化”的武器。
    阿登纳在他同艾森豪威尔的会谈公报发表后举行的记者招待会上说：他期待举行四大国外长会议。目前关于裁军的会谈不会影响西德的重新武装计划。正在建立的西德军队将用所能得到的最精锐和最现代化的武器装备起来。
