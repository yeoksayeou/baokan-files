Strive to Build the Motherland, Build a New Tibet
Representative of the Central People's Government in Tibet, Zhang Jingwu
Today is the sixth anniversary of the signing of the Agreement between the Central People's Government and the Local Government of Tibet on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet. On this joyous day for the Tibetan people, I extend my warm congratulations to the Tibetan people with excitement and pleasure.
Since the peaceful liberation of Tibet, thanks to the solidarity and cooperation of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni, the joint efforts of people from all walks of life in Tibet, the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Tibet, and the working personnel, the Tibet region has achieved remarkable achievements in implementing the central government's ethnic and religious policies, strengthening unity among ethnic groups and within the Tibetan people, and developing political, economic, transportation, cultural, and educational undertakings. I would like to express my heartfelt thanks and respect to the comrades and friends who have conscientiously implemented the agreement and worked hard.
The main achievements of Tibet in the past six years are: consolidating the unity of the motherland, strengthening the relationship between the central government and the local government of Tibet, strengthening the unity between the Tibetan and Han nationalities, and rapidly increasing the patriotic enthusiasm of people from all walks of life in Tibet. In the past few years, under the direct leadership of the local government of Tibet, the Panchen Kampus Conference Hall Committee, and the Changdu Area People's Liberation Committee, people from all walks of life in Tibet have provided various assistance to the People's Liberation Army troops and working personnel stationed in Tibet, enabling them to smoothly carry out the glorious tasks of consolidating national defense and building a new Tibet. The People's Liberation Army troops and working personnel stationed in Tibet have faithfully implemented the central government's policies and guidelines, wholeheartedly served the Tibetan people, and done much beneficial work for the Tibetan people under extremely difficult conditions. This mutual assistance between fraternal nationalities has played a significant role in eliminating historical ethnic estrangement and enhancing friendship and unity between nationalities.
Internal unity in Tibet is a necessary condition for the progress and development of the Tibetan people. The internal unity of Tibet has now been strengthened. This is another major achievement of Tibet in the past six years. The Tibetan people and people of all ethnic groups across the country are very concerned about the issue of internal unity in Tibet. In 1952, the Panchen Erdeni returned to Tibet. According to the instructions of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and in the spirit of "mutual trust, mutual respect, mutual understanding, and mutual assistance" and uniting on a new basis, the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni restored friendly relations. In 1955, the local government of Tibet and the Panchen Kampus Conference Hall Committee held negotiations on historical and outstanding issues and reached an agreement. The provisions in the Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet on promoting internal unity in Tibet have now been realized, which is very gratifying.
The establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region in April 1956 was a major event in the political life of the Tibetan people and a sign of further unity within the Tibetan people. Under the current circumstances in Tibet, it is the most suitable organizational form for preparing for the implementation of the policy of national regional autonomy. In the past year, under the leadership of the Dalai Lama, the Preparatory Committee has overcome many difficulties and actively carried out its work. It has made considerable achievements in uniting people from all walks of life, conducting patriotic education, cultivating ethnic cadres, and in economic construction, transportation, culture, and education. Facts have proved that this agency, which has the nature of political power, has played a role in promoting unity, progress within the Tibetan people. In the future, it will play a greater role in building a unified Tibet Autonomous Region and continuing to implement the Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet.
The achievements made in implementing the central government's policy of freedom of religious belief are also worth mentioning. In the past six years, the religious beliefs of the Tibetan people have been duly respected. Temples have been duly protected. The establishment of the Tibet Branch of the Buddhist Association of China and the Religious Affairs Committee of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region has further promoted unity among the various sects in Tibet.
Although the work in Tibet has achieved many successes, it is still not enough in terms of developing economic construction, developing production, and improving people's lives. Based on the current actual situation in Tibet, there are many difficulties in doing these tasks well.
Like the people of other ethnic groups in the motherland, the Tibetan people can only completely get rid of poverty and backwardness by building a socialist society. Democratic reform is the necessary path for the Tibetan people to move forward and gradually transition to socialism. Therefore, the central government adopted a positive attitude towards the issue of reform in the "Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet." The Constitution promulgated in 1954 affirmed that the common goal of all ethnic groups in our country is to build a socialist motherland, and stipulated that minority ethnic areas that have not completed democratic reforms should carry out reforms in a peaceful manner. It is certain that Tibet will carry out reforms sooner or later, but certain conditions must be met for implementing reforms in Tibet, such as the people's general and urgent demand for reform, the upper strata's genuine agreement to reform, and so on. Judging from the current situation in Tibet, these conditions are obviously not fully met. Therefore, the central government, considering the situation in Tibet, believes that democratic reforms cannot be realized in the Tibet region during the second five-year plan period. As for whether to carry out reforms during the third five-year plan period, it will be decided by the national leaders, the upper strata, and the people through consultation based on the situation at that time. It is also believed that the work in Tibet should be appropriately contracted. These policy guidelines of the central government are undoubtedly timely and correct, and all Tibetan and Han cadres and troops in Tibet should resolutely abide by them.
Although democratic reforms will not be carried out in Tibet in the next six years, our work tasks are still arduous. The basic tasks of Tibet's work in the future are: to continue to conscientiously implement the agreement, strengthen national unity and internal unity in Tibet, and strive for the progress and development of Tibet. To achieve this task, we must:
Continue to consolidate and expand the anti-imperialist patriotic united front. Firmly unite all anti-imperialist patriotic people and support their demands for progress. For the few elements who are influenced by imperialism, we will still patiently educate them and strive for them, hoping that they can return to the big family of national unity and cooperation and closely unite under the banner of anti-imperialism and patriotism, and strive to build the motherland and build a new Tibet.
We must adopt various methods and means to conduct patriotic education for the Tibetan people, and support the activities of patriotic people's organizations in all aspects. Imperialist elements and separatist elements are hostile to our national unity and progressive cause, and will inevitably carry out various sabotages. For this reason, people from all walks of life must be vigilant, unite as one, expose the destructive conspiracies of imperialist elements, oppose the separatist activities of separatist elements, and carry out resolute struggle against the above-mentioned reactionary forces.
In the work of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, we must fully respect the Tibetan people's right to be masters of their own affairs in managing internal affairs, in accordance with the Party's policy of national regional autonomy.
The work of cultivating Tibetan cadres is of great significance to the unity, progress, and development of Tibet, and must continue to be carried out in the future. Han cadres have an important responsibility in cultivating Tibetan cadres. In the past few years, a good atmosphere of consultation and mutual learning has been established between Han cadres and Tibetan cadres, and this good atmosphere should continue to be promoted. Some places still have shortcomings in insufficient consultation, which should be resolutely corrected.
We must continue to run some economic and cultural undertakings that are beneficial to the masses, welcomed by the masses, agreed and supported by the upper strata, and have the conditions to be run locally. However, under the current conditions, the conditions for large-scale economic and cultural construction in Tibet are not available.
The policy of freedom of religious belief and the policy of protecting temples must continue to be implemented unswervingly.
In our future work, we must also firmly grasp the central government's policy of prudence and steady progress. We must correct shortcomings and mistakes at any time, accumulate experience, and move forward steadily. Finally, I hope that all our Tibetan and Han cadres in Tibet and troops, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, under the direct leadership of the Dalai Lama, the Panchen Erdeni, and the Tibet Work Committee of the CPC, will work actively, struggle arduously, be modest and prudent, and guard against arrogance and rashness, and work together for the great cause of unity, progress, and development of the Tibetan people.

    为建设祖国，建设新西藏而努力
    中央人民政府驻西藏代表　张经武
    今天是中央人民政府和西藏地方政府关于和平解放西藏办法的协议签订六周年的纪念日，在这个西藏人民欢欣庆祝的节日里，我怀着兴奋和愉快的心情，向西藏人民致以热烈的祝贺。
    西藏和平解放以来，由于达赖喇嘛、班禅额尔德尼的团结合作，西藏各阶层人民、进藏人民解放军部队和工作人员的共同努力，西藏地方，无论在贯彻执行中央的民族政策和宗教政策方面，在加强民族间和藏族内部团结方面，以及在发展政治、经济、交通、文教事业等方面，都获得了显著的成就。我谨向认真执行协议、努力工作的同志们和朋友们，表示衷心的感谢和敬意。
    西藏六年来的主要成就是：巩固了祖国的统一，密切了中央和西藏地方的关系，加强了藏汉民族间的团结，并且西藏各阶层人民的爱国热情也迅速地增涨起来。过去几年内，西藏各阶层人民在西藏地方政府、班禅堪布会议厅委员会和昌都地区人民解放委员会的直接领导下，给了进藏人民解放军部队和工作人员的各种帮助，使他们能够顺利地执行巩固祖国国防，建设新西藏的光荣任务；进藏人民解放军部队和工作人员，忠实不渝地执行了中央的方针政策，全心全意地为西藏人民服务，在十分困难的条件下，帮助西藏人民做了许多有益的工作。这种兄弟民族间的相互帮助，在消除历史上遗留下来的民族隔阂和增强民族间的友爱团结等方面，起了重大的作用。
    西藏内部的团结是西藏藏族进步发展的必要条件。现在西藏内部的团结已经加强。这是西藏六年来的另一个主要成就。西藏人民和全国各族人民都非常关怀西藏内部的团结问题。1952年班禅额尔德尼回到了西藏，根据中国共产党中央和毛主席的指示，本着“互相信任、互相尊重、互相谅解、互相帮助”和在新的基础上团结起来的精神，达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼恢复了友好的关系。1955年西藏地方政府和班禅堪布会议厅委员会双方就历史和悬案问题进行谈判，达成了协议。关于和平解放西藏办法的协议中促进西藏内部团结的规定，现在已经实现了，这是非常值得庆幸的事情。
    1956年4月西藏自治区筹备委员会的成立，是西藏藏族人民政治生活中的重大事件，是西藏藏族内部更进一步团结的标志。在西藏当前情况下，它是一个最适宜于筹备实现民族区域自治政策的组织形式。近一年来，在达赖喇嘛领导下的筹备委员会，克服了许多困难，积极地进行工作，在团结各方面人士，进行爱国主义教育，培养民族干部，以及在经济建设、交通运输、文化教育等工作方面，都做出了不少成绩。事实证明，这个具有政权性质的机构，对于西藏藏族内部团结进步，起了促进的作用。今后它对于建成统一的西藏自治区和继续执行关于和平解放西藏办法的协议，将会起到更大的作用。
    在贯彻执行中央的宗教信仰自由政策方面所得到的成绩也是值得特别提出的。六年来，西藏人民的宗教信仰受到了应有的尊重。寺庙受到了应有的保护。中国佛教协会西藏分会和西藏自治区筹备委员会宗教事务委员会的成立，更促进了西藏各教派间的团结。
    西藏地方工作，虽然取得了不少成就，但是对于发展经济建设、发展生产和改善人民生活等工作，还是做得很不够的。根据目前西藏的实际情况，要做好这些工作是存在着许多困难的。
    西藏藏族人民和祖国其他民族人民一样，只有建成社会主义社会，才能彻底摆脱贫困和落后。而民主改革正是西藏民族向前进步，逐步过渡到社会主义所必经的道路。因此，中央早在“关于和平解放西藏办法的协议”中对于改革问题，采取了肯定的态度。1954年颁布的宪法中肯定了我国各兄弟民族共同的目的是建设社会主义祖国，并且确定凡是没有完成民主改革的少数民族地区，要采取和平方式进行改革。西藏是肯定迟早要实行改革的，但在西藏地方实行改革，必须具备一定条件，如人民群众有普遍的迫切的改革要求，上层人士真实同意改革等等，从目前西藏情况来看，这些条件显然是不完全具备的。因此，中央考虑西藏的情况，认为西藏地区在第二个五年计划期间还不能实现民主改革。至于第三个五年计划期间是否进行改革，将要根据当时情况，由民族领袖、上层人士以及人民群众共同协商决定。并且认为西藏工作应该作适当收缩。中央的这些方针性的指示，无疑是及时的、正确的，西藏全体藏汉干部和部队都应该坚决遵照执行。
    虽然在今后六年内西藏不进行民主改革，但是我们的工作任务还是很艰巨的。今后西藏工作的基本任务是：继续认真执行协议，加强民族团结和西藏内部团结，为西藏地方的进步和发展而努力。为了实现这个任务，我们必须：
    继续巩固和扩大反帝爱国统一战线。坚定不移地团结一切反帝爱国的人士，支持他们进步的要求。对于少数受到帝国主义的影响的分子，我们仍然耐心地对他们进行教育争取，希望他们能够回到祖国民族团结合作的大家庭中来，在反帝爱国的旗帜下，紧密地团结起来，为建设祖国、建设新西藏而努力。
    要采取各种方式方法，向西藏人民进行爱国主义教育，对爱国主义的人民团体的活动，应该从各方面予以支持。帝国主义分子和分离主义分子对于我们的民族团结和进步事业是仇视的，必然还要进行种种破坏，为此，各阶层人民都要提高警惕，团结一致，揭露帝国主义分子的破坏阴谋，反对分离主义分子的分裂活动，向上述的反动势力进行坚决的斗争。
    在西藏自治区筹备委员会的工作中，要依据党的民族区域自治政策，充分尊重藏族人民在管理内部事务上的当家作主的权利。
    培养藏族干部的工作，对于西藏的团结、进步和发展有着很重要的意义，今后仍必须继续进行，在培养藏族干部方面，汉族干部负有重要的责任。几年来，汉族干部和藏族干部间已经树立起遇事协商、相互学习的风气，这种优良的风气，应该继续发扬。有些地方还存在协商不够的缺点，应当坚决纠正。
      要继续兴办一些对群众有利、群众欢迎、上层人士同意和支持、地方又有条件兴办的经济文化事业。但是在目前条件下，在西藏进行大规模经济文化建设的条件是不具备的。
    宗教信仰自由政策和保护寺庙政策，必须继续坚持不渝地执行。
    在今后工作中，我们还必须牢牢地掌握中央的慎重稳进的方针。随时纠正缺点错误，积累经验，稳步前进。最后，希望我们全体在西藏的藏汉干部和部队人员，在中国共产党和中央人民政府的领导下，在达赖喇嘛、班禅额尔德尼、中共西藏工委的直接领导下，积极工作、艰苦奋斗、谦虚谨慎、戒骄戒躁，为西藏人民的团结进步发展的伟大事业共同努力。
