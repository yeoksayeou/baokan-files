    The Face of "New Life" Village Has Changed
    Albanian Writer A. Qiachi
    A new village has been built on the road to Berat. This village is named "New Life," the same as the name of the agricultural production cooperative here.
    Passing travelers cannot help but inquire about the origin of this village.
    The tiled-roofed, stone-walled houses were built by the villagers in recent years; the original small thatched cottages scattered throughout the village have been used as livestock sheds or feed stores.
    I have known this village for a long time before liberation. Now I will briefly introduce its story so you can understand how much it has changed in recent years.
    In the past, the farmers here lived in small thatched huts, without a single stone house. Their thatched huts had no chimneys. When a fire was lit, the whole house was filled with smoke. The farmers did not own land; only the officials and landlords did. These officials and landlords could drive away tenants at will, forcing them into desperate situations, because all the landlords treated them the same way.
    Old man Lusi Ala said to us:
    "I have moved six times. I used to live in this village where I live now. When it came to harvest season, the landlord, fearing I would get my share of the grain, would drive me out for some trivial matter. Where could I go? I took my meager belongings and set off aimlessly… I went to another village called Semen… I settled down in a small thatched hut. I worked hard, but still couldn't get enough to eat. At harvest time, the landlord drove me out again… I went to Kruja… I tremble with anger when I recall these past events… Now, like other farmers, I have been freed from suffering. Now I am a member of the agricultural production cooperative, and I have a new house with orange trees planted in front of it. In short, I live like a human being."
    The experiences of other farmers in the village were similar to those of Lusi Ala. Now these people, living a happy life, are filled with resentment when they talk about the past.
    The farmers obtained land from the land reform of 1945. In the first few years after the land reform, the lives of the villagers were still difficult. Of course, they had obtained land, and the state provided them with various assistance, but their harvests were not high because the land was fragmented, and there were no agricultural machines or chemical fertilizers.
    A group of agricultural production cooperatives were established not far from the village. The first Albanian agricultural production cooperative, the Gokkruzhe Cooperative, and other cooperatives were established. News spread in the village that cooperative farmers were reaping rich harvests and living prosperous lives. At that time, rich peasants were also spreading rumors, but the villagers did not believe them because the facts were clear. Therefore, some farmers in this village also wanted to organize agricultural production cooperatives, but some farmers disagreed.
    In November 1950, after a long period of preparation, the majority of farmers in the village decided to establish an agricultural production cooperative. The conditions for concentrating land and labor tools in the village were ripe.
    From the very beginning of the cooperative's establishment, the work progressed well. Women, who previously had no habit of working in the fields, now also began to work in the fields.
    However, the face of the village only changed fundamentally when tractors and other agricultural machines began to appear in the fields. From then on, wooden plows were only used in hilly areas. Farmers who had not joined the agricultural production cooperative, seeing how well the cooperative farmers were living, also expressed their desire to join the cooperative. In the fierce battle of agricultural collectivization, the party organization played a leading role.
    As you approach the village, you can see from afar the houses built one after another according to plan. The existing twenty-five households have built twenty-five houses. The dividends distributed to cooperative members increase every year. The villagers often say: "Why not work hard to cultivate our land? Now that we have gained freedom, if we sweat on the land, the land will reward us."
    Not far from the village, a clear spring flows, and soon people will bring it into the village. The cooperative farmers plan to build three reservoirs in the village. People will transform the village into a brand-new village. Farmer Aba Neicha said: "We will throw away everything that is old and useless!"
    A new reading room has been built in the village. People can see the day's newspapers here. There are also many books. Villagers often read various books here, especially books about rural life. Once, the villagers recited excerpts from the Chinese writer Zhou Libo's novel "The Hurricane." On the same day, electricity was also transmitted to this village. A nursery will soon be established here.
    The "New Life" Cooperative is well-suited to its beautiful name. Everything here is new. But the cooperative farmers have not forgotten the past, they often say: "In order to move forward, in order to defend the fruits we have gained and created, we must not forget the pain of the past."
    During festivals and when someone gets married, they often sing this song they wrote themselves:
    "In the past, I was a hired worker of the officials and landlords,
    I cultivated on other people's fields;
    To feed the village chief, the police, and the priest,
    I was busy all year round.
    My house was leaning and crooked,
    The four walls were full of holes and cracks.
    Turtles crawled past the door one by one,
    Like officers and their soldiers."

### “新生活”村的面貌改变了

    “新生活”村的面貌改变了
    阿尔巴尼亚作家　阿·恰奇
    在通往贝拉特城的公路旁，新建起了一座村庄。这座村庄取名“新生活”，和这里的农业生产合作社的名字一样。
    过路的旅行者都不免要打听这座村庄的来历。
    那些瓦顶石墙的房屋是村民们近几年修建的；原先散落在村里的小茅屋则已用作饲畜舍或饲料库了。
    我在解放前很久就认识了这座村庄，现在我来简单地介绍它的故事，让你们了解几年来这里有多么大的变化。
    从前这里的农民都居住在小茅草屋里，没有一所石建的房屋。他们的茅草屋没有烟囱，一生火，满屋子都是烟。农民们自己没有土地，只有官老爷才有土地。这些官老爷可以任意赶走佃户，把他们逼得走投无路，因为所有的地主对待他们都是一样的。
    年老的卢西·阿拉对我们说：
    “我曾经搬过六次家。我以前也住在现在住的这个村庄里，一到收获的季节，地主怕我分去我那份粮食，就为一点小事把我赶出去。我到哪里去呢？我拿着仅有的一点东西，茫然地上路了……我走到另外一个叫塞孟的村庄里……我在一所小茅屋中住下来。我辛苦地劳动，但是仍然不得一饱。在收获时，地主又把我从这里赶走……我到克鲁雅去了……我一回想起这些往事，就会气得发抖，……现在我已像别的农民一样，从苦痛中解脱出来了。现在我已成为农业生产合作社社员，我有一所新房屋，屋前还栽种了桔树。总之，我活得像个人了。”
    村中其他农民的遭遇也和卢西·阿拉的经历有许多相同的地方。现在这些过着幸福生活的人一谈到过去都非常愤恨。
    农民们从1945年的土地改革中获得了土地。土地改革后的最初几年间，村民的生活仍然是困难的。当然，他们已经获得了土地，国家还给予他们各种援助，但是他们的收成不高，因为土地分散，也没有农业机器和化学肥料等。
    离村庄不远成立了一批农业生产合作社。阿尔巴尼亚第一个农业生产合作社高克鲁热合作社以及别的合作社都成立了。村庄里流传着这样的消息：合作农民获得了丰收，他们生活得很富裕。那时富农也在散布谣言，但是村民都不相信他们，因为事实摆得很明显。于是，这个村庄里有些农民也想组织农业生产合作社，但也有些农民不同意。
    1950年11月，经过长时间的酝酿后，全村大多数农民已决定成立农业生产合作社。本村土地和劳动工具集中的条件成熟了。
    从合作社一开始建立起，工作就进行得很好。从前妇女没有在田间劳动的习惯，现在也开始在田间劳动了。
    但是，只有当拖拉机和其他农业机器开始出现在田野上的时候，村庄的面貌才从根本上发生了变化。从此以后，木犁就只在丘陵地带使用了。没有参加农业生产合作社的农民，看到合作农民生活过得好，也表示要加入合作社。在农业集体化的激烈战斗中，党组织起着领导作用。
    当你走向村庄时，你从很远便看到那些根据计划一个接一个修建起来的房屋。现有的二十五户人家共建筑了二十五所住宅。合作社员分得的红利每年都有增加。村民们常说：“为什么不努力耕种我们的土地呢？既然已经获得了自由，那么，我们在土地上流汗，土地会报答我们的。”
    离村庄不远有一股清泉流过，不久人们就要把它引进村庄。合作农民计划在村里修筑三个蓄水池。人们将把村庄改造成为一个全新的村庄。农民阿巴·奈查说：“我们要把一切陈旧无用的东西都扔掉！”
    村里新建了一个阅览室。人们在这里可以看到当天的报纸。书籍也很多。村民们经常在这里阅读各种书籍，尤其是有关农村生活的书。有一次村民朗诵了中国作家周立波的小说“暴风骤雨”的片断。就在同一天，电流也传送到这个村庄来了。这里不久还要成立一个托儿所。
    “新生活”合作社和它美丽的名字很相称。这里一切事物都是新鲜的。但是合作农民们并没有把过去的日子忘掉，他们常常说：“为了前进，为了保卫我们所获得和创造的成果，不应当忘掉过去的痛苦”。
    在节日和有人举行婚礼的时候，他们常常唱这支他们自己编的歌：
    “从前我是官老爷的雇工，
    我在别人的田地上耕种；
    为了养活村长、警察和神父，
    一年到头我忙个不停。
    我的房屋东倒西歪，
    四壁都是洞穴和裂缝。
    乌龟一个个从门前爬过，
    好像军官和他的士兵。”　（本报特约稿　李宁来译）（附图片）
    丰收的果实给她带来了欢乐的笑容。
