　　National Construction Commission's Bureau of Fuel Industries and the Ministry of Electric Power have recently devised an important method to save investment in the construction of thermal power plants: by adding a certain number of complete sets of spare power generation equipment within the power supply system to replace spare boilers in each power plant, both ensuring normal power supply and saving 5% to 15% of construction investment.

　　Special contribution to this newspaper by Xinhua News Agency reporter Li Feng: In the future, thermal power plants built within the power supply system will no longer need to be equipped with spare boilers. This way, during China's Second Five-Year Plan, the investment for thermal power plants can be used to build approximately one more power plant with a capacity of over 100,000 kilowatts.

　　By utilizing the spare boilers of already built thermal power plants, it is also possible to install approximately 400,000 kilowatts of steam turbine generator sets. Utilizing these spare boilers to install steam turbines and generators can save 20% to 60% of the investment compared to building new power plants. This is one of the important achievements of the National Construction Commission's Bureau of Fuel Industries and the Ministry of Electric Power in recently studying how to save investment in thermal power plant construction.

　　Thermal power plants built in China since the First Five-Year Plan generally followed the pattern of "two machines (two generators and two turbines) and three boilers," "three machines and four boilers," or "four machines and five boilers." This was to ensure a safe power supply. Because boilers are more prone to accidents than turbines and generators, and the time for boiler maintenance is longer than that for generators and turbines, setting up a spare boiler allows the generator and turbine to be supplied with steam from the spare boiler immediately after they are repaired or when a boiler accident occurs, thus shortening the power outage time.

　　In recent years, it has been proven that this method of ensuring a safe power supply requires too much investment and leaves too many boilers idle. During the First Five-Year Plan, out of the 176 boilers ordered from abroad for 45 power plants, 34 were spare boilers; the purchase cost of these spare boilers totaled more than 180 million yuan. To date, 70% of the spare boilers in the ten power plants that have already been put into production have not played a significant role in production. Although the national power supply was very tight last year, 17.5% of the boiler evaporation capacity of major power plants across the country was idle and unused.

　　Relevant departments believe that changing the method of setting up spare boilers to ensure a safe power supply for thermal power plants built within the power supply system is conditional. The reliability of a safe power supply for a power supply system mainly depends not on the safe operation of individual power plants, but on the safe operation of the entire power supply system's power generation equipment. Therefore, individual power plants do not need to set up spare boilers, but instead, a certain number of complete sets of spare power generation equipment can be added within the power supply system. This can "shoot four eagles with one arrow," solving the problems that spare boilers solve, ensuring normal power supply when generators and turbines have accidents or are being repaired, and saving money compared to setting up spare boilers in each plant. Using this method, the construction investment for each kilowatt of power generation capacity is 5% to 15% less than using the method of setting up spare boilers.

　　The second reason for not equipping spare boilers is that the role of spare boilers is becoming smaller and smaller. Due to the improvement of the manufacturing level of motor equipment and the technological level of the power industry both at home and abroad, the safe power supply has greater reliability. Compared with 1953, the number of accidents involving boilers, turbines, and generators in the Ministry of Electric Power decreased by 50% to 62% last year. Due to the reduction of accidents, the interval for overhauling these equipment has also been extended compared to the past. Now, major motor equipment can generally be overhauled once every two years, and the time for annual boiler maintenance has also been shortened compared to the time for generator and turbine maintenance. Therefore, the role of spare boilers is not as great as before.

　　Not setting up spare boilers in the future is also in line with the development trend in thermal power generation construction worldwide regarding the coordination of boilers with turbines and generators. The Soviet Union's Sixth Five-Year Plan stipulates that all 90 power plants with absolute atmospheric pressure above, except for combined heat and power plants, are equipped with one machine and one boiler. In the United States, over 90% of the power plants put into production in 1954 were also equipped with one machine and one boiler.

　　Based on China's specific situation, the National Construction Commission believes that about 42% or more of the thermal power plants to be built during the Second Five-Year Plan can do without spare boilers.

　　Relevant departments are currently studying specific revisions to the designs of those power plants that are under construction and planned for construction, as well as the problem of utilizing existing spare boilers.

    “一箭射四雕”
    国家建设委员会燃料工业局和电力工业部最近研究出一个节省火力发电站建设投资的重要办法：在供电系统内增设一定的成套备用发电设备，以代替在各个电站的备用锅炉，既可保证正常供电，又可节约建设投资5％到15％。
    本报特约稿　新华社记者李峰报道：今后在供电系统内建设火力发电站，可以不必再设置备用的锅炉，这样我国第二个五年计划用于火力发电站的投资，大约可以多建设一个相当于十几万瓩的发电站。
    利用已经建成的火力发电站的备用锅炉，还可以增装大约四十万瓩的汽轮发电机组设备。利用这些备用锅炉增装汽轮机和发电机，比新建电站可以节省20％到60％的投资。这是国家建设委员会燃料工业局和电力工业部最近研究节省火力电站建设投资的重要成果之一。
    我国第一个五年计划以来建设的火力发电站，一般都是二机（发电机和汽轮机各二）三炉（锅炉）、三机四炉或四机五炉。这样可以保证安全供电。因为锅炉比汽轮机和发电机容易出事故；检修锅炉的时间比检修发电机和汽轮机的时间长一些，设一台备用的锅炉，可以使发电机和汽轮机检修好以后，或在锅炉发生事故时，立即由备用的锅炉供应蒸汽来发电，以缩短停电时间。
    近几年来，证明这种保证安全供电的方法，需要的投资太大，闲置的锅炉太多。第一个五年计划期间，我国向国外订购的四十五个电站的一百七十六台锅炉中，有三十四台是备用的；这些备用锅炉的购买费共一亿八千多万元。到目前为止，已经投入生产的十个发电站的备用锅炉，有70％没有在生产中发挥显著的作用。去年全国供电虽然十分紧张，但是全国主要电厂的17.5％的锅炉蒸发能力却闲置无用。
    有关部门认为，在供电系统以内建设的火力发电站，改变设置备用锅炉来保证安全供电的方法是有条件的。一个供电系统的安全供电的可靠性，主要不取决于个别发电厂的安全运行，主要是取决于整个供电系统发电设备的安全运行。因此，各电厂就可以不设置备用锅炉，而在供电系统以内，增设一定的成套备用发电设备。这样就可以一箭射“四雕”，即既解决了备用锅炉所解决的问题，又保证了发电机和汽轮机发生事故和检修时能正常供电，而且比分散在各厂设置备用锅炉还省钱。用这种方法，每一瓩发电容量的建设投资，比用设置备用锅炉的方法节省5％到15％。
    可以不设备用锅炉的第二个根据是，备用锅炉的作用愈来愈小了。由于国内外电机设备的制造水平和电力工业技术水平的提高，安全供电有了更大的可靠性。去年同1953年作比，电力工业部的锅炉、汽轮机和发电机发生事故的次数，减少了50％到62％。由于事故的减少，大修这些设备的间隔也比过去延长了。现在主要电机设备，一般的可以每两年大修一次，每年检修锅炉的时间比检修发电机和汽轮机的时间，也已经缩短。因此，备用锅炉的作用就不像从前那样大了。
    今后不再设置备用锅炉，也符合目前世界上火力发电建设中关于锅炉同汽轮机和发电机的配合的发展趋势。苏联第六个五年计划中规定，除热电站以外，所有九十个绝对大气压压力以上的电站，都是一机配一炉。美国1954年投入生产的电站，90％以上也是一机配一炉。
    根据我国的具体情况，国家建设委员会认为第二个五年计划将要建设的火力发电站，约有42％以上可以不用备用锅炉。
    目前有关部门将具体研究修改那些正在建设和计划建设的电站的设计，以及利用已有的备用锅炉的问题。
