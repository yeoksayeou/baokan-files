Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, May 17th: According to a report by the Polish News Agency, Gomulka stated in his report on "Key Issues in the Party's Policy" at the Ninth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party on the 15th that the task of the Ninth Plenary Session is to develop the issues contained in the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session.

Gomulka said that in the past twelve years, we have built socialism in Poland. Although socialism is universal, its construction form is shaped by the specific conditions of location and time. The Eighth Plenary Session formulated three guidelines for the development of the form of socialist construction in Poland. The first is through workers' committees, the second is through expanding the power of the People's Councils, and the third is through developing various economic forms of peasant autonomy.

The Question of the Laws of Socialist Construction

Gomulka pointed out that socialism opposes any form of nationalism; the essence of socialism lies in its international nature. Emphasizing the path of a country towards socialism strictly means distinguishing the methods of building socialism in a particular country from the path towards socialism followed by the Soviet Union. Every country has its own specific characteristics of development, and the different characteristics of different countries are reflected in the methods of building socialism and constitute factors in the path towards socialism. However, emphasizing the different conditions and national characteristics caused by history does not mean denying the general laws derived from the Soviet Union's experience in socialist construction. If these general laws are denied in practice, it will directly lead to the abolition of socialism. Underestimating or negating the general laws of socialist construction experienced by the Soviet Union is nationalistic revisionism. This revisionism must be opposed. On the other hand, underestimating or negating national characteristics and specific features in socialist construction is nihilistic dogmatism, which must also be eradicated.

Gomulka believes that the general laws universally applicable to the socialist struggle can be summarized as follows:

(1) Organizing a Marxist-Leninist party of the working class and the working masses that implements the worker-peasant alliance policy under the guidance of the principle of democratic centralism;

(2) After overthrowing bourgeois rule, establishing the dictatorship of the proletariat over exploiters and oppressors;

(3) Socializing capitalist means of production, gradually changing production relations in the countryside, and incorporating the entire national economy into a defined scope of centralized planning and management;

(4) Implementing a policy guideline that conforms to the Leninist principles of proletarian internationalism, respecting the equality and sovereignty of all countries and nations, and uniting socialist countries and socialist forces against imperialist aggression and defending peace.

The Role and Tasks of Workers' Committees

Speaking about the role and tasks of workers' committees, Gomulka said that generally speaking, workers' committees are a form of working-class democracy within the proletarian dictatorship system, encompassing production and industrial management aspects. Workers' committees are not organs of political power of the working class, nor are they administrative units of the people's state. Workers' committees are institutions through which the working class directly participates in the management of the national economy.

Gomulka pointed out that although the origin of workers' committees in Poland comes from Yugoslavia, it is necessary to adopt a different development direction for Polish workers' committees than Yugoslavia. He also expressed opposition to collective ownership of industrial enterprises by workers and advocated that workers' committees should only be established in industrial enterprises, not in higher-level industrial management institutions. He believes that the tasks of workers' committees are to enable workers to understand the factory's production and labor situation, express opinions on the professional competence of those responsible for production, and propose effective measures to combat theft, bribery, and other criminal activities in factories. According to law, the powers and tasks of workers' committees also include organizing work, technological progress, labor discipline, and distributing factory funds. The party organization in the enterprise is still the leading political force, organizing the working class and intellectuals to strive for higher technical levels and more, better, and cheaper products.

Gomulka then discussed the issue of expanding the scope of activities of the People's Councils at the provincial and especially the lower levels. He said that Poland's main policy guideline regarding democratic local state power organs is to increase their power and independence.

On Agricultural Policy

Regarding agricultural policy, Gomulka said that the form of collectivized agriculture is the only good form we know, but most of the agricultural cooperatives established in the past period have not withstood the test of life. We are eliminating past mistakes and supporting the development of healthy collectivized agriculture. We are also looking for new paths. It is necessary to develop various forms of cooperative agriculture and collective activities as widely as possible in the countryside.

Gomulka pointed out that the work of party organizations in the countryside will mainly focus on cooperatives. The party has adopted a policy of widely developing various forms of peasant cooperatives in its agricultural policy. These cooperative organizations, organized by the peasants themselves, can facilitate the work of the peasants and help improve agricultural standards and increase production. These organizations will encourage the tendency of working together among peasants, teach them to organize joint operations, and enable them to better utilize the means of production.

Gomulka said, "I don't think anyone in our party wants to develop capitalism in Poland. The development of capitalism in the countryside and the exploitation of manpower can and must be curbed through various social forms of small and medium-sized peasant production and various forms of agricultural production cooperatives. A very important regulatory factor in these issues is the people's regime, the state of the dictatorship of the proletariat."

Gomulka talked about the importance of the worker-peasant alliance to Poland. He pointed out that peasants account for approximately 45% of Poland's population. The essence of this alliance lies in the policies pursued by the working class and the Communist Party.

Gomulka said, "We recognize the United Peasant Party as an independent party, a permanent factor in Poland's political life and Poland's path to socialism. At the same time, the Party must express increasing concern about the infiltration of some alien elements, some even hostile to the people's regime and socialism, into certain ranks of the United Peasant Party. We express serious concern about the tolerant attitude of some leading organs of the United Peasant Party towards these phenomena. Some organizations of the United Peasant Party openly attack our Party, the people's regime, and cooperation between the two parties with a hostile attitude. Our Party cannot tolerate such a situation because these are not internal affairs of the United Peasant Party, this is tantamount to undermining our people's social system. A fundamental principle laying the foundation for the alliance and cooperation between our Party and the United Peasant Party, with the Democratic Party, and laying the foundation for our joint election platform is: to consolidate and develop the socialist construction of Poland. This principle has been accepted and recognized by both parties. Now is the time to practically implement this principle."

When talking about the relationship between the state and the church, Gomulka said, "Our Party is based on the scientific viewpoint of dialectical materialism, and it is incompatible with the idealist worldview. However, we have reached an understanding with the Catholic Church and even agreed to implement non-compulsory religious education in schools. The Party starts from the assumption that the idealist worldview will coexist with the materialistic worldview for a long time. Believers and non-believers, the church and socialism, the people's government and the church hierarchy will also coexist for a long time. Coexistence does not exclude a certain form of ideological struggle, but it should exclude political battles. The church should recognize that Poland has changed its past social system, it is building socialism. In matters related to the vital interests of the People's Poland and the entire people, we hope that the church will move forward with us along Poland's path."

The Role of the Party in Socialist Construction

Speaking about the role of the Party in Poland's socialist construction, Gomulka said, "Improving the work of managing the national economy and governing the country will first of all be determined by the Party, by the Party's strength and unity, the Party's ideology, the Party's connection with the masses, and the degree of the Party's influence on the masses."

Gomulka said, "Party unity cannot be a mechanical and blind unity based on obediently executing orders, but must be a conscious unity out of the will, belief, and consistent goals of all Party members, and this unity must be built on the principle of democratic centralism. There is ample freedom of speech within the Party. However, Party members have no right to express opinions outside the Party that are inconsistent with the attitude of the majority of Party members and with the Party's policies stipulated by the Party organization."

Gomulka said that the Politburo of the Party Central Committee, reorganized by the Eighth Plenary Session, is now able to take concerted action. This is a great victory for the Party. However, the Party's weakness over a relatively long period of time has allowed reactionary forces to reactivate. They once used the slogans of the Eighth Plenary Session as a guise to launch a large-scale attack on the Party. Since the Eighth Plenary Session and up to the present, the Party has not been able to establish full unity in its ranks. Gomulka emphasized the particular danger of revisionism. He said that revisionism undermines Party unity, spreads distrust among Party members and the working class about the correctness of the Party's policies. It disarms the Party and the working class in the struggle for socialism. Revisionism is an obstacle to social development. The Party cannot tolerate the existence of any groups and factions within its organization, no matter what names they take. Gomulka also said that dogmatism and conservatism also disarm the Party, although the methods are different.

Gomulka pointed out that the Party can only be strong when it can maintain close ties with the working class and the working masses through its daily practical work, only when the Party shares weal and woe with them while incorporating this way of life into its own political tendencies. This requires party organizations at all levels to master the methods of exerting political influence among the masses, encourage the activities of grassroots party organizations, and overcome conservatism in the work of party institutions. Leaders in political and economic life should be closer to the masses.

Gomulka then said that the Party should absorb into its ranks the most conscious and combative members of the working class, peasants, and intellectuals who are loyal to the cause of socialism. Efforts should be made to transform merely nominal and passive party members into true party members. But when these efforts fail to produce results, these people should be removed from the Party rolls. The issue of the Party's quality and the grassroots Party organizations’ ability to act should be of paramount importance.

Economic Issues

Gomulka then spoke about economic issues. He said that although the Five-Year Plan stipulates that the real wages and incomes of the people should increase by 30%, this increase has not yet produced the necessary prosperity. In 1956 and 1957, the speed of wage increases far exceeded the proportions stipulated in the Five-Year Plan. The total wage bill in 1957 will be twenty-five billion zlotys more than in 1955. Due to the rapid increase in real wages and the income of the rural population exceeding the planned limits, certain difficulties have arisen in supplying general consumer goods in the market. Therefore, socialist stores have recently lacked butter and sometimes milk. Gomulka emphasized that in the current economic situation of the country, it is impossible to find more funds to increase wages. The main task at present is to prevent prices of basic consumer goods from rising.

Gomulka spoke about the short-term strikes that took place in industrial and mining enterprises after economic demands were made. He said that it must be made clear that the Party is against strikes, it cannot organize strikes, nor can it support strikes. At the same time, in the event that workers put down their tools and stop working, we do not want to take administrative measures. In a socialist country, a strike either indicates a problem in administration or indicates that saboteurs or elements hostile to the people's regime are carrying out activities. These two factors sometimes appear simultaneously. Most importantly, a strike shows the political weakness of the Party organization, the lack of political connection between the Party and the working class, and with the masses. We do not deny the workers' right to strike, but we must tell them: strikes are not a way to improve living conditions, they do not increase but rather decrease the wealth of the country. Such a strike is a manifestation of some kind of contradiction between the working class or some of its parts and the people's regime. However, these contradictions are not antagonistic, or they may be non-antagonistic. They can usually be resolved through mutual understanding between the people's regime and the working class.

Relations with Fraternal Parties

Gomulka spoke about the relations between the Polish United Workers' Party and the Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries. He mentioned the talks held with the fraternal parties of some countries. He said that on some issues, sometimes even on important issues, there are certain differences in opinion between us and some fraternal parties. For example, the French comrades have different views from us on some issues, there are also differences in opinion between us and the Yugoslav comrades, and there are other differences with some other parties. However, I want to emphasize very firmly that in all our talks, everyone involved in the talks is convinced that these or other differences of opinion do not violate the principles of proletarian internationalism, the commonality of ideas and goals, and the class content of all our parties that unites us. In terms of relations between parties, we have always emphasized what unites us with other Communist and Workers' Parties, and set aside those things that could divide us, and let time decide. If it is occasionally necessary to hold open discussions between parties, these discussions should be held on the principle of mutual loyalty, and no unfounded accusations should be made in the discussions.

Gomulka said that some members of the United Workers' Party have lost the revolutionary pointers of Marxism-Leninism. The Party resolutely condemns anything that wants to oppose the unity of the socialist countries, wants to undermine Polish-Soviet friendship and alliance, and undermine the principles of internationalism. The Party must protect the unity of the socialist countries and the unity of the international working-class movement headed by the Communist and Workers' Parties like protecting the pupil of one's eye.

Gomulka emphasized that the Polish United Workers' Party is strengthening its internationalist relations with the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, and pointed out the economic cooperation between Poland and the German Democratic Republic and Czechoslovakia.

He then said, "Our Party follows the activities of the Chinese Communist Party with deep sympathy. The Chinese Communist Party is developing the creative doctrine of Marxism-Leninism with the greatest courage. A manifestation of the Chinese Communist Party's great strength and its close unity with the people is the new method implemented in this country to resolve non-antagonistic contradictions."

Gomulka said that our Party is advancing shoulder to shoulder with the revolutionary movement of the working class around the world. No force can separate us from this movement. We reject and will continue to reject any ridiculous attempts to find "national communism" in our Party.

When talking about foreign policy, Gomulka pointed out that the basis of Polish foreign policy is to prevent war and to restrain the imperialist war forces with the peaceful will of all countries in the world. The Polish United Workers' Party supports the principle of coexistence between countries with different social systems. The United Workers' Party is implementing a policy of peace and solidarity with all forces in the world striving for peace.

    关于党的政策中的关键问题
    哥穆尔卡在波兰党的九中全会上的报告（摘要）
    新华社华沙17日电　据波兰通讯社报道，哥穆尔卡15日在波兰统一工人党中央委员会第九次全体会议上关于“党的政策中的关键问题”的报告说，九中全会的任务是发展八中全会决议中所包含的问题。
    哥穆尔卡说，十二年来，我们在波兰建设了社会主义。虽然社会主义是具有普遍性的，但是它的建设的形式是由地点和时间的具体条件形成的。八中全会拟订了关于波兰社会主义建设形式的发展的三条方针。第一是通过工人委员会，第二是通过扩大人民会议的权力，第三是通过发展农民自治的各种经济形式。
    社会主义建设的规律问题
    哥穆尔卡指出，社会主义是反对任何形式的民族主义的；社会主义的实质就在于它具有国际性。强调本国走向社会主义的道路，严格地说，就意味着把某一个国家里建设社会主义的方法和苏联所遵循的走向社会主义的道路区别开来。每一个国家总有它自己的发展的具体特点，不同国家的不同特点反映到建设社会主义的方法上，并且构成走向社会主义的道路的因素。但是强调由于历史而造成的不同条件和民族特性，决不是意味着否认从苏联的社会主义建设经验中得出来的普遍原则的总规律。如果在实践中否认这些原则的总的规律，就会直接导致取消社会主义。低估或者否定苏联所经历的社会主义建设的总规律，那就是民族主义的修正主义。必须反对这种修正主义。另一方面，在社会主义建设中低估或者否定民族特性和具体特点，那是虚
  无主义的教条主义，也必须把它根除掉。
    哥穆尔卡认为，普遍适用于社会主义斗争的总规
  律可以归纳为如下几方面：
    （一）组织一个在民主集中原则的指导下执行工
  农联盟政策的工人阶级和劳动大众的马克思列宁主义
  政党；
    （二）在推翻资产阶级统治后，建立无产阶级对剥削者、压迫者的专政；
    （三）资本主义生产手段的社会化，逐渐改变农
  村的生产关系，把整个国民经济纳入集中计划和管理
  的确定的范围；
    （四）执行符合于无产阶级国际主义的列宁主义
  原则的政策方针，尊重一切国家和民族的平等和主
  权，社会主义国家和社会主义力量团结一致反对帝国
  主义侵略，保卫和平。
        工人委员会的作用和任务
    哥穆尔卡在谈到工人委员会的作用和任务时说，
  一般讲来，工人委员会是在无产阶级专政制度内工人阶级民主的一种形式，它包括生产方面、工业管理方
  面。工人委员会不是工人阶级的政权机关，也不是人
  民国家的行政机构单位。工人委员会是这样一种机构：工人阶级通过它直接地参加国民经济的管理。
    哥穆尔卡指出，波兰的工人委员会的起源虽然是
  来自南斯拉夫，但是对波兰的工人委员会有必要采取不同于南斯拉夫的发展方针。他还表示反对职工对工业企业的集体所有，并且主张工人委员会只设立在工业企业中，而不是设在更高级的工业管理机构中。他认为，工人委员会的任务是使工人了解工厂的生产情况和劳动力情况，对生产方面负责人员在业务上是否称职发表意见，并且提出有力的措施来反对工厂中的盗窃、行贿和其他犯罪行为。根据法律，工人委员会的权力和任务还包括组织工作、技术进步、劳动纪律、分配工厂基金等。企业中的党组织仍旧是居于领导地位的政治力量，它组织工人阶级和知识分子为争取更高的技术水平和更多、更好、更便宜的产品而斗争。
    哥穆尔卡接着谈到扩大省、特别是较低的各级人民会议活动范围的问题。他说，波兰关于民主的地方国家权力机关的主要政策方针是增加它们的权力和独立性。
          关于农业政策问题
    关于农业政策问题，哥穆尔卡说，合作化农业的形式是我们知道的唯一的好的形式，但是大多数在过去一段时期成立的农业合作社没有经得住生活的考验。我们正在消灭过去的错误，并且支持健康的合作化农业的发展。我们也正在寻找新的道路。必须在农村中尽可能广泛地发展各种不同形式的合作化农业和集体活动。
    哥穆尔卡指出，党组织在农村中的工作将主要集中在合作社方面。党在农业政策上采取了广泛发展各种形式的农民合作社的方针。由农民自己起来组织的这些合作组织可以使农民工作方便，并有助于提高农业水平和增加生产。这些组织将在农民中间鼓励共同工作的倾向，教导他们组织共同经营，使他们能够更好地利用生产资料。
    哥穆尔卡说，我认为我们党内没有人想在波兰发展资本主义。资本主义在农村中的发展、对人力的剥削，可以而且一定要通过小农和中农生产的各种社会形式以及各种形式的农业生产合作社来制止。在这些问题上，一个十分重要的调节因素就是人民政权，就是无产阶级专政的国家。
    哥穆尔卡谈到了工农联盟对波兰的重要意义。他指出农民占波兰人口的大约45％。这种联盟的实质在于工人阶级和共产主义政党所奉行的政策。
    哥穆尔卡说，我们承认统一农民党是一个独立的政党，是波兰政治生活中、波兰通往社会主义的道路上的一个永久性的因素。同时，党对于一些异己分子、一些甚至敌视人民政权和社会主义的分子渗入统一农民党的某些队伍中去的情况，必须表示越来越大的不安。我们对于统一农民党的有些领导机构对待这些现象所采取的容忍态度表示严重的不安。统一农民党的有些组织以敌对态度公开攻击我们党、人民政权以及两党之间的合作。我们党不能容忍这样一种状况。因为这些并不是统一农民党的内部事务，这等于是破坏我们的人民社会制度。奠定我们党同统一农民党、同民主党的联盟与合作、奠定我们的联合竞选纲领的一个根本原则是：巩固和发展波兰的社会主义建设。这一原则已经为两党所接受和承认。现在该是实际履行这一原则的时候了。
    哥穆尔卡在谈到国家和教会的关系问题的时候
  说，我们党是以辩证唯物主义的科学观点为基础的，唯心主义世界观和它毫不相容。然而，我们已经和天
  主教会取得了谅解，甚至同意在学校里实行非强迫性
  的宗教教育。党是从这样一个假定出发的：唯心主义
  世界观将长期同唯物主义世界观一道存在。教徒和非
  教徒、教会和社会主义、人民政府和教会的教阶组织
  也将长期地同时存在。同时存在并不排除一定形式的
  思想斗争，但是应当排除政治战斗。教会应当认识到，
  波兰已经改变了它过去的社会制度，它正在建设社会
  主义。在关系到人民波兰和全国人民的切身利益的事情上，我们希望教会同我们一起沿着波兰的道路前进。
        党在社会主义建设中的作用
    谈到党在波兰社会主义建设中的作用，哥穆尔卡
  说，改善管理国民经济和治理国家的工作，将首先决
  定于党，决定于党的力量和团结、党的意识形态、党
  同群众的联系以及党影响群众的程度。
    哥穆尔卡说，党内团结不能是建立在顺从地执行
  命令的基础上的机械和盲目的团结，而必须是出于全
  体党员的意愿、信仰和一致的目标的自觉团结，这种
  团结必须建立在民主集中制原则的基础上。党内有充
  分的言论自由。但是，党员无权在党外发表同多数党
  员的态度以及同党组织所规定的党的政策不一致的意
  见。
    哥穆尔卡说，由八中全会改组的党中央委员会政
  治局，今天能够采取一致的行动了。这是党的伟大胜
  利。但是，党比较长期来的软弱无力使反动力量重新
  活动起来。它们曾以八中全会的口号作为幌子向党发
  动了大规模的进攻。八中全会以后一直到目前为止，
  党还没有能够建立起它的队伍的充分团结。哥穆尔卡
  强调指出修正主义的特殊危险性。他说，修正主义破
  坏党的团结，在党员和工人阶级中间对党的政策的正
  确性散布不信任。它解除党和工人阶级为社会主义而
  斗争的武装。修正主义是社会发展的障碍。党不能容
  忍在它的组织内存在任何集团和派系，不管它们采取
  什么样的名目。哥穆尔卡又说，教条主义和保守主义
  同样也解除党的武装，虽然采取的方法有所不同。
    哥穆尔卡指出，只有当党能够通过它的日常实际
  工作同工人阶级以及劳动群众保持千丝万缕的联系的时候，只有当党和他们同甘共苦而同时又把这种生活
  道路纳入党自己的政治倾向中去的时候，党才能是强
  大的。这就要求各级党组织掌握在群众中发挥政治影
  响的方法，鼓励基层党组织的活动，并在党的机构的
  工作中克服保守主义。政治和经济生活的领导人应该
  更加接近群众。
    哥穆尔卡接着说，党应该把工人阶级、农民和知
  识分子中忠于社会主义事业的觉悟最高、最富有战斗
  精神的部分，吸收到自己的队伍中来。应该设法把仅
  仅是挂名的消极的党员转变成为真正的党员。但当这
  种努力不能产生效果的时候，就应该把这些人从党的
  名册上剔除掉。党的质量问题、基层党组织的活动能
  力问题应该具有头等重要的意义。
            经济问题
    哥穆尔卡接着谈到了经济问题。他说，在五年计
  划中虽然规定人民的实际工资和收入要增加30％，但
  是这一增加到目前为止还没有产生必要的繁荣。在
  1956年和1957年，工资增加的速度大大超过了五年计划中所规定的比例。工资总额在1957年将比1955年增多二百五十亿兹罗提。由于实际工资和农村人口收入
  的迅速增加超过了计划的限度，因而在市场上供应一
  般消费品方面引起了某些困难。因此，社会主义商店最近缺乏牛油，有时也缺乏牛奶。哥穆尔卡着重指出，在
  国家目前的经济情况下，无法找到更多的资金来增加
  工资。目前的主要任务是阻止基本消费品价格上涨。
    哥穆尔卡谈到了工矿企业里在提出经济要求以后所进行的短期罢工。他说，必须说清楚，党是反对罢工的，既不能组织罢工，也不能支持罢工。同时，万一工人们放下工具不干了，我们不希望采取行政措施。在一个社会主义国家里，罢工不是表示在行政管理上有毛病，就是表明捣乱分子或敌视人民政权的分子在进行活动。这两个因素有时是同时出现的。最重要的是，罢工表示出党组织政治上的软弱、党和工人阶级、和群众之间缺乏政治联系。我们并不否认工人的罢工权，但是必须告诉他们：罢工并不是改善生活条件的办法，它们并不增加而是相反地减少国家的财富。这样一种罢工是工人阶级或是它的某些部分同人民政权之间存在某种矛盾的一种表现。但是，这些矛盾并不是对抗性的，或者可能是非对抗性的。它们通常可以通过人民政权同工人阶级之间相互谅解的办法加以解决。
          同兄弟党的关系
    哥穆尔卡谈到了波兰统一工人党同各国共产党、工人党的关系。他提到了同一些国家的兄弟党所进行的会谈。他说，在某些问题上，有时甚至在重要问题上，我们同一些兄弟党在看法上存在着某些分歧。例如，法国同志在某些问题上与我们看法不一样，我们同南斯拉夫同志之间也存在着看法上的分歧，同其他某些党之间还有其他的分歧。然而，我要非常坚决地强调：在我们所有的会谈中，任何参与会谈的人都确信这种或是另外一些意见上的分歧并没有违反无产阶级国际主义的原则、思想和目标的共同性以及团结我们一切的党的阶级内容。在党与党之间的关系方面，我们一向强调把我们同其他共产党、工人党团结起来的东西，而把那些能够使我们分裂的东西撇开，让时间来判定。如果偶尔必要在各党之间举行公开讨论的话，这种讨论应该在相互忠诚的原则上举行，在讨论中绝不应该提出没有事实根据的指责。
    哥穆尔卡说，统一工人党有些党员失掉了马克思列宁主义的革命指针。党坚决地谴责那些想要反对社会主义国家阵营的团结、想要破坏波苏友谊和联盟、破坏国际主义原则的任何事物。党必须像保护眼珠那样保护社会主义国家阵营的团结和以共产党、工人党为首的国际工人阶级运动的团结。
    哥穆尔卡着重指出了波兰统一工人党正在加强同德国统一社会党和捷克斯洛伐克共产党的国际主义关系，指出了波兰同民主德国和捷克斯洛伐克的经济合作。
    他接着说，我们党怀着深切的同情注视着中国共产党的活动。中国共产党以最大的勇气发展着马克思列宁主义的创造性学说。中国共产党的巨大力量和它同人民的紧密团结的一个表现是这个国家实行了解决非对抗性矛盾的新方法。
    哥穆尔卡说，我们的党正在同全世界的工人阶级革命运动并肩前进。没有任何力量能够把我们同这个运动分开。我们拒绝并且将继续拒绝想要在我们党内寻找“民族共产主义”的任何无聊的企图。
    哥穆尔卡在谈到外交政策时指出，波兰外交政策的基础是防止战争，用全世界所有国家的和平意志来约束住帝国主义战争势力。波兰统一工人党支持社会制度不同的国家实行共处的原则。统一工人党实行着和平和同全世界一切争取和平的势力团结的政策。
