Xinhua News Agency, 30th - Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Lai Ruoyu, in a conversation with Xinhua News Agency reporters on the eve of the "May 1st" International Labor Day, stated that China's labor movement has seen new developments in the past year and has played a significant role in the country's political, economic, and social life.

Lai Ruoyu said that in the past year, due to the launch of the advanced producers' movement nationwide, wage reforms, and improvements in the living welfare of workers, the enthusiasm of the vast number of workers has been unprecedentedly high, greatly promoting China's socialist construction.

Recently, the advanced producers' movement seems to have become somewhat quiet. He believes that relevant departments and enterprises should continue to deepen and elevate the movement based on summarizing and promoting new advanced experiences. He pointed out that the law of the advanced producers' movement is to summarize, promote, and consolidate a batch of advanced experiences, and then summarize, promote, and consolidate another batch on a new basis, so that the movement can be continuously improved and developed.

Lai Ruoyu said that the current primary task is to vigorously launch a production increase and economy drive, and this movement should be a continuation and development of the advanced producers' movement. He believes that from the perspective of the production process, the advanced producers' movement is the production increase and economy drive.

In addition, we should focus on considering the role that trade unions should play in resolving contradictions among the people. He believes that as a mass organization of the working class nationwide, the trade union must, on the one hand, reflect and represent the opinions of the masses and support their legitimate opinions and demands; on the other hand, it must organize and educate the vast number of workers to understand the overall situation and difficulties of the country, so as to resolve contradictions and handle problems in the spirit of conforming to the overall and long-term interests of the entire working class.

In order to play this role, the trade union itself must overcome bureaucracy and a style of work that is divorced from the masses. This first requires improving the democratic system of the trade union and the democratic life of its members. In terms of organization, the democratic principle in elections should be adhered to, and necessary democratic procedures should be fulfilled on schedule; in terms of finance, a realistic and responsible account should be given to the workers; the legitimate demands and correct opinions of the workers in production and work, politics and study, as well as wages, living, and welfare, must be supported by the trade union. Only by resolutely following the mass line and integrating with the masses can we play the role of representing and educating the masses.

Lai Ruoyu also said that the democracy of the trade union also involves the democracy of enterprises and the issue of mass supervision. He believes that both the trade union and enterprise administration should be constantly supervised by the masses.

This year, China's trade unions will convene the Eighth National Congress of Trade Unions. Lai Ruoyu said that before the Eighth National Congress of Trade Unions, we must first explore, sort out, and organize the role that trade unions should play in handling contradictions among the people and the experience of democratic management of enterprises.

In terms of international activities, Lai Ruoyu said that in the past year, Chinese trade unions have had extensive contacts and connections with trade unions of various factions in many countries around the world, especially in Asia and Africa. For the first time, China sent formal trade union delegations to Japan, Ceylon, Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, Sudan, and Australia. Trade union representatives from Thailand, Singapore, Nepal, and other countries were also invited to China for the first time to participate in this year's "May 1st" celebrations. These friendly exchanges are of great help in promoting understanding, unity, and cooperation among trade unions in Asian and African countries and even in countries around the world.

Lai Ruoyu believes that the Fourth World Trade Union Congress to be convened by the World Federation of Trade Unions is extremely important, and it will make a great contribution to the unity and development of the international workers' movement. He said that the Chinese working class, which has always supported the unity and cooperation of the working class around the world, warmly welcomes the congress.

    赖若愚主席谈今年工会任务
    开展增产节约运动  健全工会民主制度
    新华社30日讯  中华全国总工会主席赖若愚在“五一”国际劳动节前夕对新华社记者发表谈话说，过去一年来我国工人运动有了新的发展，在国家的政治、经济、社会生活中起着显著的作用。
    赖若愚说，过去一年中，由于在全国范围内开展了先进生产者运动，进行了工资改革和改善了职工的生活福利，广大职工的积极性和热情空前高涨，大大推动了我国社会主义的建设事业。
    最近以来，先进生产者运动看来有些沉寂。他认为有关部门和企业应该在总结、推广新的先进经验的基础上把运动继续引向深入和更高的水平。他指出，开展先进生产者运动的规律是总结、推广、巩固一批先进经验之后，再在新的基础上总结、推广、巩固另一批，如此循环不已，而使运动不断提高发展。
    赖若愚说，当前的首要任务是大力展开增产节约运动，而这个运动应该是先进生产者运动的继续和发展。他认为就生产过程来看，先进生产者运动就是增产节约运动。
    此外，应该着重考虑工会在解决人民内部矛盾中应起的作用这个问题。他认为，作为全国工人阶级的群众性组织，工会一方面要反映并且代表群众的意见，支持他们的正当的意见和要求；另一方面又要通过组织教育广大职工，使他们了解国家的全面情况和困难，以便本着符合全体工人阶级的全面、长远利益的精神来解决矛盾，处理问题。
    为了起到这个作用，工会本身必须克服官僚主义和脱离群众的作风。这首先要求健全工会的民主制度和会员的民主生活。在组织方面应该坚持选举中的民主原则，按期履行必要的民主程序；在财务方面应该向职工群众作切实负责的交代；职工群众在生产和工作，政治和学习以及工资、生活、福利等方面的正当要求和正确意见，工会必须予以支持。只有坚决走群众路线，同群众打成一片，才能起到代表群众、教育群众的作用。
    赖若愚又说，工会的民主也牵涉到企业的民主，牵涉到群众监督的问题。他认为工会和企业行政都应该经常受到群众的监督。
    今年我国工会将要召开第八次全国工会代表大会。赖若愚说，在第八次全国工会代表大会以前，要先把工会在处理人民内部矛盾中应起的作用和企业民主管理的经验摸索整理出来。
    在国际活动方面，赖若愚说，一年来中国工会同世界许多国家，特别是亚非各国的各派工会有了广泛的接触和联系。我国第一次派出正式的工会代表团到日本、锡兰、埃及、约旦、摩洛哥、苏丹和澳大利亚去。泰国、新加坡、尼泊尔等国的工会代表也第一次应邀来我国参加今年的“五一”节观礼。这些友好来往大有助于促进亚非各国以至世界各国工会之间的了解、团结和合作。
    赖若愚认为即将由世界工会联合会召开的第四次世界工会代表大会极为重要，它将对国际工人运动的团结和发展作出巨大的贡献。他说，一贯支持全世界工人阶级团结合作的中国工人阶级对大会表示热烈的欢迎。
