Xinhua News Agency, Paris, May 30th: Former French Minister of Finance and Chairman of the Popular Republican Movement, Pierre Pflimlin, told President Coty on the evening of the 29th that he "in principle" accepted the task of attempting to form a new government.

Pflimlin accepted the task of attempting to form a new cabinet because the "exploratory" activities of Pleven to form a cabinet failed. Pleven reported to President Coty on the 29th that he had not been able to eliminate the divisions between the conflicting political groups in the country, and that he himself was unwilling to serve as Prime Minister.

Coty had asked Antoine Pinay of the Independent Party to form a new government, but Pinay also refused his request.

After meeting with Coty, Pflimlin said he would strive to organize a broad "coalition" government.

The Popular Republican Movement is a Catholic political party and has seventy-four seats in the National Assembly. In this government crisis, the party has repeatedly emphasized that it will never participate in any government without the participation of the Socialists.

Pflimlin served as Minister of Agriculture for four years in eight cabinets after the war, and also served as Minister of Finance in the cabinet of former Prime Minister Faure. It is reported that he is an active supporter of the "European unification" plan.

### 法国新阁依然难产  人民共和党主席尝试组班

    法国新阁依然难产
    人民共和党主席尝试组班
    据新华社30日讯　巴黎消息：法国前财政部长、人民共和党主席比埃尔·弗林姆兰29日晚对总统戈蒂表示，他“原则上”接受试组新政府的任务。
    弗林姆兰接受试组新阁的任务，是因为普利文组阁的“试探性”活动失败了。普利文在29日向戈蒂总统报告说，他没有能消除这个国家的互相有争执的政治团体之间的分歧，而他本人也不愿意出任总理。
    戈蒂曾经要求独立党的安托万·比内组织新政府，但是比内也拒绝了他的要求。
    弗林姆兰在同戈蒂会谈之后说，他将努力组织一个广泛的“联合”政府。
    人民共和党是天主教政党，在国民议会中拥有七十四个议席。在这次政府危机中，这个党一再强调，它决不参加任何没有社会党人参加的政府。
    弗林姆兰在战后曾经先后在八个总理任内担任过四年的农业部长，并且曾经在前总理富尔任内担任过财政部长。有消息说，他是“欧洲统一”计划的积极支持者。
