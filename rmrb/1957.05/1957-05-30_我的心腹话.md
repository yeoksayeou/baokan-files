    My Heartfelt Words
    Bai Yunsheng
    I have always been straightforward and spoken my mind. On stage, I dare to play any role, so I have the nickname "Bai the Bold" in the Kunqu opera troupe. In the old society, Kunqu opera was not valued, so I looked for opportunities to appeal to society through writing or speaking. I once added a speech about Kunqu opera to the performance of "The Flower Girl Picks Up Gold." During the period of enemy occupation, I switched to performing Peking opera, but I combined Kunqu and Peking opera, performing one Kunqu opera and one Peking opera in each performance, hoping to preserve Kunqu opera while performing Peking opera. When I first performed Peking opera's "The Battle of Red Cliffs," I also gave a speech, hoping to make society aware of Kunqu opera and give it sympathy and support.
    I have always been loyal to the Kunqu opera cause, believing that Kunqu opera is not my personal property, but the cultural heritage of the motherland. Since liberation, the Party and Chairman Mao have called for "Letting a hundred flowers bloom and weeding through the old to bring forth the new." Isn't Kunqu opera a flower? Many other operas or programs for abroad are based on Kunqu opera programs with modifications, but Kunqu opera itself does not receive care and cultivation. As someone so loyal to Kunqu opera, how distressed I am in my heart. At the end of 1949, I joined the Beijing People's Art Theatre and gathered dozens of Kunqu opera actors from the north to Beijing to participate in the work. Only one or two leaders in the theatre agreed, while the majority opposed it. As a result, these people were transferred away or sent back home, leaving only a few to teach dance. Mr. Han Shichang and I spoke several times to leading cadres in the literary and art circles about how to deal with Kunqu opera, but we received no response. Instead, they said it was court entertainment, detached from the people, and could not be revived. Some also said: "Pass on your artistic skills to some new opera genre." We had no choice but to obey the leadership, and we had words in our hearts that we couldn't speak, so we could only watch it wither away. Since I am someone who loves to speak, why didn't I dare to argue? Because since I started revolutionary work, my experience has been that those who don't like to speak are considered good people and are rewarded or promoted, while those who like to speak are criticized and considered bad guys, and they are terrified of being criticized during movements. Sometimes I heard instructions on literature and art from the talks or reports of senior leaders, and I felt happy and excited, thinking that there would be a solution. But when it came to the middle and lower levels, the actual actions of the leaders were very different. For example, in the performance of opera, only foreign operas were promoted, and traditional Chinese operas were not valued; in singing, Western vocal techniques were used to sing Chinese operas, and it was believed that the Chinese systematic singing and recitation methods were unscientific; in dance, it can be said to be completely balletized, and even ancient figures were represented with ballet poses; in music, Western orchestras were added to any local opera, even small operas with only one or two people used large orchestras of twenty or thirty people, overshadowing the main performance; the same was true of the scenery. Some of these problems have already been discovered in the work, but I dare not speak out, because I am afraid of being labeled with a pile of labels that I can't remove, such as: "conservative ideology, old-fashioned," "nostalgic for the old society," "sticking to conventions, standing still," "backward thinking." The most serious thing is being called a "dishonest element" or having "bad thoughts." In this situation, some people have to "clam up" and develop negative thoughts such as watching the wind, not speaking out when things happen, or "it's none of my business."
    Since liberation, in various meetings, I have always mentioned Kunqu opera when discussing art. But some people always say that I am "parochial, have gang views," "revivalist, mentally ill, national essence faction." Since the performance of "Fifteen Strings of Cash," it has received the attention of the Party, the government, and society, and it has also revived the ancient opera genre of Kunqu opera. Premier Zhou convened a forum in Zhongnanhai and proposed that Northern Kunqu opera should also be organized. But it has not been formally established for a year. Of course, there are many objective reasons, and the leaders have also spent a lot of energy. But in terms of quotas, funding, and housing, a series of difficult-to-overcome difficulties have been created. I am not saying this to be greedy or insatiable. Our Party has always done things with confidence and perseverance, but why is it so delayed and helpless when it comes to Kunqu opera? For example, the orchestra of a certain theatre troupe has 70 people, while our total number of people, including service personnel, is only 70, which makes it impossible to rehearse large-scale martial arts operas. Some theatres receive financial subsidies of 700,000 to 800,000 yuan, and the number of people has grown to more than 600, even if it is streamlined, it is much larger than our scale. For example, if there are a hundred kinds of flowers, some have been growing for seven or eight years, and some are old trees that have just sprouted, if there is only one load of water, should it be watered evenly, or should more care be given to the newly sprouted buds? Kunqu opera is like an old tree that has just sprouted. Our artists, the youngest of whom are around 50 years old, are gradually declining in energy and need the help of talented cadres. But the problem of transferring cadres is very difficult, and there is strong verbal support, but there is actually some departmentalism. For example, when Mr. Han Shichang and I were in the Central Experimental Opera Theatre, we could not play a big role. At the Second National Congress of Literary and Art Workers, Comrades Yun Yanming and Zhang Chunhua proposed that the two of us go to the Peking Opera Theatre. I also said: "I am like a piece of glass, its characteristic is transparency, it should be placed on the window, now it is placed on the wall, its role is only to prevent people from getting dirty." The same is true for other teachers. We are engaged in Kunqu opera for life, but we cannot receive the overall art of Kunqu opera, we only dismantle a few gestures and postures to learn, and break the overall art into pieces. Comrade Zhang Peiren is good at playing the pipa and loves Kunqu opera. Because he rarely works in his post, he has been learning Kunqu opera since he was a child and has rich Kunqu opera music knowledge and playing skills. He is willing to participate in the Kunqu opera organization and has repeatedly requested it, but it has not been resolved.
    I think the problem in the field of art is: "Chinese and foreign are not treated equally," everything foreign is good, and everything Chinese is not good. In terms of people, foreigners are experts, and Chinese people do not receive the respect they deserve as experts. "The new and the old are not treated equally," new opera genres have people and money, but old opera genres are not treated like this. Of course, compared to the old society, we should be content. "The old and the young are not treated equally," the old artists are only respected verbally, but they are not actually respected as they should be, which also causes some young people to disrespect their teachers. In the past few years, the Party has given great support to the cause of literature and art in terms of economy and manpower, but it has not cultivated actors with high artistic standards. What is the reason? It is worth considering.
    Under the call of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," I am speaking from my heart. I believe that the Party will be determined to support the cause of Kunqu opera. Now society has paid attention to Kunqu opera and is looking forward to this withered flower not only reviving but also blooming brilliantly. Our Kunqu opera artists have a greater responsibility, so we also have some demands on the Party and the government. As the saying goes: "If a worker wants to do a good job, he must first sharpen his tools." In terms of manpower and material resources, we hope that we will be given sufficient conditions. Only in this way can Kunqu opera art be revived and inherited and developed. This is not only the common wish of our Kunqu opera veteran artists, but also the unanimous demand of all young actors engaged in this art. We hold sincere hope, and we ask the leaders and all sectors of society, as well as fraternal groups, to give us support and help.

    我的心腹话
    白云生
    我向来心直口快有话就说，在舞台上不论什么角色都敢扮演，因此在昆曲班中有白大胆的称号。在旧社会里昆曲得不到重视，我就找机会用文字或说话向社会呼吁，曾在演
  “花子拾金”中加入对昆曲的讲话。在敌伪时代我曾改演皮黄，但是昆黄两下锅，每场都是一出昆曲，一出皮黄，要在演皮黄时保存昆曲。第一次演皮黄“群英会”时也曾讲过话，想通过这个方法使社会人士对昆曲有些认识，给以同情和支援。
    我始终是忠实于昆曲事业，认为昆曲不是我个人的，是祖国的文化遗产。解放以来，党和毛主席号召“百花齐放，推陈出新”。昆曲算不算是一朵花？其它剧种或出国节目很多是根据昆曲节目加以修改，而昆曲反得不到爱护培植。我对昆曲如此忠诚的人，心中是如何难过。一九四九年底我参加了北京人民艺术剧院，就把北方昆曲演员数十人召集到北京参加工作。本院领导上只有一、二人同意，多数反对，结果将这些人调走或遣散回家，只剩下几个人教舞蹈。我与韩世昌先生数次向文艺界领导干部谈起对昆曲应如何处理，都没得到答复，反而说是宫庭娱乐，脱离人民，不能复活。也有人说：把你们这一身艺术传授给某新生剧种。我们只有服从领导，心里有话，不好开口，只好看它枯萎下去。我既是一个爱说话的，为什么不敢争论？因为参加革命工作以来，我的一点经验，听到，看到凡是不爱说话的，被认为是好人，给以奖励或提升，爱说话的受到批评，被认为是坏小子，遇有运动就心惊胆战怕挨整。有时从高级首长的谈话或报告听到对文艺方面的指示，心里愉快高兴，以为这就有办法了。但是到了中下层，领导上实际做的大有出入。如在戏曲的表演上，只提倡外国的，不重视中国传统的；歌唱上练洋嗓子唱中国戏，认为中国很有系统的唱念方法是不科学的；舞蹈方面可以说是完全芭蕾化，甚至于表现古代人物也生搬硬套地用芭蕾舞姿来表现；音乐方面，任何地方戏都加入西洋乐队，就是一二人的小戏也用二三十人的大乐队，喧宾夺主；布景也不例外。这一连串的问题有一部分在工作中已经发现了，但是不敢说，因为怕扣一大堆帽子摘不下来，如：“保守思想老一套”，“留恋旧社会”，“墨守陈规，故步自封”，“落后思想”。最严重的是被说成“不老实分子”，“思想不良”。在这种情形下，一部分人不得不“噤若寒蝉”，产生了看风使舵、逢事不开口，或与我无关等等消极想法。
    解放以来，在各种会场中，借谈论艺术的机会，我必要提到昆曲。但总有人说我“本位主义，帮会观点”，“复古主义，神经病，国粹派”。自从“十五贯”演出后，得到了党，政府，社会的注意，也救活了昆曲这个古老剧种。周总理在中南海召集座谈会，提出了北方昆曲也要组织起来。可是一年来一直没有正式成立。当然客观原因很多，领导上也费了很多精力。但在名额、经费和房子方面都造出一系列很难克服的困难。我说这话并不是得寸进尺，贪得无厌。我们党向来做一件事是说做就做，有信心有毅力，为何对昆曲就这样迟延而无办法？如某剧院一个团的乐队就有七十人，而我们总人数连勤杂人员一共只有七十人，致使大型武戏不能排演。有的剧院在经济上补助七、八十万，人数发展到六百多名，就算它怎样精简，也比我们的规模大得多。譬如说有一百种花，有的已经成长七、八年，有的是多年枯树才生幼芽，如果只有一担水，是否应该平均浇灌，还是多照顾刚生嫩芽的？昆曲好比多年古树才生新芽。我们的艺人，年纪最小的五十岁左右，精力渐衰，需要有才能的干部来帮助。但是调干问题，困难颇多，口头上大力支援，实际上有些本位主义。举个例子，如我与韩世昌在中央实验歌剧院时，起不了大作用。在二次文代会上，云燕铭、张春华同志提出要我二人到京剧院去。我也讲过：我好比一块玻璃，它的特质是透明的，应当放在窗户上，如今把它放在墙上，起的作用只不过是让人们不蹭上一身土。其他的老师也是如此。我们是终身搞昆曲的，而不能把昆曲整体的艺术接收下来，只是拆除少数的身段姿式来学习，把整体艺术弄得支离破碎。有一位张佩仁同志擅长弹琵琶，爱好昆曲，因在他本岗位上工作很少，他自幼学习昆曲，有丰富的昆曲音乐知识与演奏技巧，本人愿参加昆曲组织，多次请求，得不到解决。
      我看艺术方面的问题是：“中外不公”，外国的都好，中国的都不好。在人的方面，外国的是专家，中国的则得不到专家应得的尊敬。“新旧不公”，新生剧种要人有人，要钱有钱，对古老的剧种则不是这样照顾。当然比在旧社会时，我们是应该知足。“老少不公”，对于老艺人只是口头尊敬，实际上并没受到应有的尊重，也就引起一些青年人不尊师。几年来党在文艺事业方面的经济上、人力上给了很大的支援，但并没有培养出有高等艺术水平的演员，其原因何在，是值得考虑的。
    在“百花齐放，百家争鸣”号召之下，说出心腹话，我相信党对昆曲事业一定下决心支持的。现在社会上对昆曲已经注意，期待着这朵枯萎的花不但复活而且能开得灿烂。我们昆曲艺人的责任更大，所以我们对党和政府也就有一些要求。常言说：“工欲善其事，必先利其器”。对于人力，物力方面，希望给我们足够的条件，只有这样，才能使昆曲艺术能够复活并得到继承与发扬。这不但是我们昆曲老艺人们的共同愿望，也是全体从事这一艺术的青年演员们的一致要求。我们抱着热诚的希望，请领导上和社会各界，以及各兄弟团体，给予我们扶持与帮助。
