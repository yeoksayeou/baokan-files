Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Newspapers in various countries continue to comment on the anti-American demonstration in Taipei, believing it to be the result of the United States' brutal enslavement of the Taiwanese people and the transformation of Taiwan into an aggressive outpost. They also point out that the brutal suppression by the American aggressors and the Chiang Kai-shek clique cannot suppress the patriotic strength of the Taiwanese people.

The Vietnamese "Nhan Dan" (People) newspaper published an editorial on the 28th, stating that the Taiwanese people's strong resistance to American atrocities demonstrates that no new American weapons can frighten the vast people of Taiwan and around the world, who hate the United States to the core. The more the United States expands its military bases and scope of aggression, the more it invites greater anger, and ultimately, it will bury itself.

The editorial stated that the unyielding Taiwanese people and all the Chinese people will surely complete the task of liberating Taiwan and returning Taiwan to the embrace of the motherland.

"Minju Choson" (Democratic Korea) newspaper stated in an editorial on the 28th that the Korean people express great indignation at the atrocities of the American military in Taiwan and extend warm, militant congratulations to the Taiwanese people who have risen to fight for national honor and legitimate rights.

The editorial stated that the Taiwanese people, who have long been tormented by the reactionary policies of the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek clique, can no longer endure it. The motherland's call for peaceful liberation of Taiwan has touched the heartstrings of everyone in Taiwan. The suppression of the insurgent people by the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek clique cannot subdue the patriotic strength of the Taiwanese people.

Bulgarian major newspapers and Sofia Radio have continuously published and broadcast news of Taipei residents heroically opposing the American aggressors since the 25th.

The "Otechestven Front" (Fatherland Front) newspaper published a commentary on the 26th, pointing out: The act of destroying the American Embassy shows the Taipei residents' hatred for the American aggressors. Now the whole world knows what the Taiwanese people want.

Many Indian newspapers, commenting on the patriotic anti-American demonstrations of the Taiwanese people, generally believe that these actions demonstrate the people's resentment towards the American occupying forces.

The Bengali newspaper "Azad" (The Free) believes that these demonstrations are "a manifestation of the people's power rising up against foreign oppressors." The newspaper pointed out that these demonstrations "will make the road to the peaceful liberation of Taiwan wider."

Several newspapers pointed out that the demonstrations show that there is a wide gap between the Kuomintang rulers and the Taiwanese people. "The Times of India" warned that this gap is very large and that even 33,000 Kuomintang troops cannot "make the people obedient."

The Egyptian "Al Misaa" (Evening News) said on the 27th that the people of Asia and Africa were very excited to hear the news of the Taiwanese residents rising up to fight. The example set by the Taiwanese residents will be emulated. Their struggle will not stop here, it will be echoed in the movement against the policies and treaties of American imperialism in Asia and Africa.

The Parisian "Le Monde" published an editorial on the 27th, stating that this incident shows: "American policy is not only in danger of being damaged in Taiwan, but also in Asia. Neutral sentiment and anti-Western sentiment are taking effect in Asia."

The editorial stated that in Taiwan, "people may gradually feel that Taiwan is nothing more than an American 'protectorate,' and that the United States only regards it as a future atomic base." Therefore, the "morale there is low."

    美国镇压不了台湾人民的爱国力量
    各国舆论继续声援台北反美大示威
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：各国报纸继续评论台北反美大示威事件，认为这是美国横暴奴役台湾人民和把台湾变为侵略前哨的结果，并且指出美国侵略者和蒋介石集团的残酷镇压是压制不了台湾人民的爱国力量的。
    越南“人民报”28日发表社论说，台湾人民对美国暴行的强烈反抗，说明了美国任何新式武器都吓不倒台湾和世界各地的广大人民，他们是把美国恨入骨髓的。美国越是扩大军事基地和侵略范围，就越招来更大的愤怒，而最后必将埋葬了自己。
    社论说，不屈的台湾人民和全中国人民一定能够完成解放台湾的任务，使台湾回到祖国的怀抱。
      “民主朝鲜报”28日社论说，朝鲜人民对于美军在台湾的暴行表示极大的愤慨，并且向为了民族的荣誉和正当的权利而起来斗争的台湾人民致以热烈的战斗的祝贺。
    社论说，长期被美国和蒋介石集团的反动政策折磨的台湾人民，再也不能忍受下去了。祖国关于和平解放台湾的号召打动了台湾的每个人的心弦，美国和蒋介石集团对起义人民的镇压是压服不了台湾人民爱国力量的。
    保加利亚各大报纸和索非亚广播电台25日以来连日刊载和广播台北居民英勇反对美国侵略者的消息。
    26日的“祖国阵线报”发表评论指出：捣毁美国大使馆的行动表明台北居民对美国侵略者的仇视。现在全世界已经知道台湾人民想的是什么了。
    印度许多报纸在评论台湾人民的爱国反美大示威时普遍认为，这些行动表现了人民对美国占领军的愤恨。
    孟加拉文日报“自由报”认为，这些示威是“人民力量起来反对外国压迫者的表现”。这家报纸指出，这些示威行动“将使和平解放台湾的道路更加宽阔”。
    好些报纸指出，这次示威说明在国民党统治者和台湾人民之间存在着一条宽阔的鸿沟。“印度时报”警告说，这种鸿沟是非常大的，就是三万三千名国民党军队也无法“使人民顺从”。
    埃及“晚报”27日说，亚非两洲各国人民听到台湾居民起来斗争的消息，感到十分兴奋。台湾居民所树立的榜样，会有人效法。他们的斗争不会到此为止，它将会在亚非两洲反对美帝国主义的政策和条约的运动中得到响应。
    巴黎“世界报”27日发表社论说，这次事件表明：“美国的政策不仅在台湾有遭到损害的危险，而且在亚洲也有遭到损害的危险。中立情绪和反西方情绪正在亚洲起作用。”
    社论说，在台湾，“人们可能逐渐感到台湾已经不过是美国的一个‘保护国’，而且美国不过把它看成是一个未来的原子基地而已。”因此，那里的“士气是低沉的。”
