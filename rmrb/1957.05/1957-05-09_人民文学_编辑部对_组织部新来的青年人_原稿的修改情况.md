"People's Literature" Editorial Department Compilation

A significant portion of the revisions made by the editors of this journal to the original manuscript of "The Young Newcomer in the Organization Department" pertain to textual matters, which cannot all be listed here. The more important revisions, involving the work's ideological content, character portrayals, relationships between characters, etc., are listed below.

    1. According to the author now, the original title of the novel was "An Youngster Came to the Organization Department." The first original title recorded in the manuscript registry was "Organization Department New Come Youngster," which was ultimately changed by the editors to "The Young Newcomer in the Organization Department."

    First Section

    2. Lin Zhen came out of Liu Shiwu's office and heard typing in a room. Lin Zhen thought, "She, like me, must be newly transferred, right?" The "she" in the original manuscript was originally "he." The following sentence, "Lin Zhen didn't know on what basis, but guessed the typist must be a woman," was also added by the editors.

    Second Section

    3. Zhao Huiwen was in the office at night duplicating documents, and Lin Zhen stood beside her, helping her stack the copied papers neatly. She looked up at Lin Zhen while copying. The original manuscript then had a passage: "(Zhao Huiwen said playfully:) 'Don't get angry when I tell you, I'm definitely not intentionally mocking you...' Lin Zhen urged her to speak, and she said, 'My son has eyes that look like yours.' Suddenly laughter drowned out her words. Lin Zhen looked at her strangely: 'Are you married?' Zhao Huiwen said: 'Of course, my child does have a father.' Lin Zhen laughed loudly, but Zhao Huiwen did not laugh." This passage was deleted by the editors.

    Fifth Section

    4. At the beginning of this section, the original manuscript had these sentences: "The impressions and problems that accumulated in Lin Zhen's mind during the first ten days of life in the District Committee were more than he had in the two years he spent in elementary school. He could not understand many complicated people and things." These sentences were deleted by the editors.

    5. Later, the original manuscript had these sentences: "Sometimes, at first glance, he felt that the District Committee cadres were casual and relaxed, chatting and reading newspapers during office hours, boldly joking about topics that Lin Zhen considered most serious in elementary school..." This was changed by the editors to: "Sometimes, he felt that the mental state of the District Committee cadres was casual and relaxed, chatting and reading newspapers during office hours, boldly joking about topics that Lin Zhen considered most serious..."

    6. Next, the editors added this paragraph to the original manuscript: "Strangely, Lin Zhen couldn't tell whether his new environment was good or bad. He still got up early every day to play with dumbbells, just like he did in elementary school, and still gave people the impression of being 'simple' or even 'naive.' However, his inner activities were much more numerous than in elementary school. He had to learn to judge everything and everyone."

    7. Lin Zhen went to Liu Shiwu's office and found Liu trying to persuade Zhao Huiwen to reconcile with her husband. After Zhao Huiwen left, Liu Shiwu said to Lin Zhen, "Zhao Huiwen and her lover have fallen out again..." The original manuscript then had two sentences: "Lin Zhen didn't want to ask about Zhao Huiwen's affairs. He coughed twice, choked by the smoke." These two sentences were deleted by the editors.

    8. During the conversation between Liu Shiwu and Lin Zhen, the original manuscript had some descriptions of Liu Shiwu: he exhaled "smoke that had turned white from being inhaled too deeply," he "looked like he was swallowing something" when he spoke, he "pulled the chair closer to Lin Zhen, the chair legs making a harsh noise," regarding Wang Qingquan, he spoke of him "‘old brother’ ‘old brother,’ as if enumerating an incompetent child"... These descriptions were all deleted by the editors.

    9. When Liu Shiwu mentioned Wang Qingquan, the original manuscript wrote: "Wang Qingquan was sent to work in the Kuomintang army, he served as the deputy regiment commander of the Kuomintang army... He went to the enemy to disintegrate them, but he himself also contracted some of the habits of Kuomintang officers, and also got sick, unable to change..." This was changed by the editors to: "Wang Qingquan was sent to work in the Kuomintang army, he served as the deputy regiment commander of the Kuomintang army... He went to disintegrate the enemy, but he himself also contracted some of the habits of Kuomintang officers, unable to change..." Then, Liu Shiwu said, "His mistakes should be criticized and corrected." This was changed by the editors to: "His mistakes are unforgivable."

    Sixth Section

    10. In the party group meeting, Liu Shiwu criticized Lin Zhen: "As soon as you arrive at a new job," you want to "act as a Nastya-style hero," which is "a kind of vanity." The original manuscript then wrote: "Lin Zhen trembled as if he had been hit, bloodshot appeared in the whites of his eyes, and he bit his lower lip tightly." The editors rewrote it as: "Lin Zhen trembled as if he had been punched, he bit his lower lip tightly, and suppressed the anger and pain in his heart."

    Seventh Section

    11. Lin Zhen was invited to Zhao Huiwen's home. The original manuscript wrote: "After she and Lin Zhen arrived home, her mother rested. She led Lin Zhen to see her son." "Zhao Huiwen whispered to Lin Zhen: 'His eyes...' (Note: Earlier, Zhao Huiwen had said to Lin Zhen that his eyes were like her son's eyes.) The child closed his eyes, and Lin Zhen couldn't see." These words were deleted by the editors.

    12. When Zhao Huiwen was talking to Lin Zhen, the original manuscript had this description of her actions: she was "pinching her fingers one by one." The editors changed it to: she was "pinching her white, beautiful fingers one by one."

    13. Zhao Huiwen talked to Lin Zhen about Liu Shiwu. The original manuscript wrote: "He knows what is 'right' and what is 'wrong'..." The editors added the words "According to his own words" before this sentence. Also, in the original manuscript, after the sentence "He...appreciates achievements, only appreciates," there was this sentence: "Just like he is outside the vortex of life, outside citizenship," the editors deleted this sentence. In addition, the "life" in the original manuscript's "He sees through life," "He confidently copes with life," were both changed to "everything"; "He no longer needs to learn from life piously" was changed to "He no longer needs to learn piously"; "He grabs life in his hands" was changed to "He grabs things in his hands"; "He is like the boss of life" was changed to "He is like the boss of everyone."

    14. Lin Zhen asked about District Committee Secretary Comrade Zhou Runxiang, and Zhao Huiwen replied: "Comrade Zhou Runxiang is a very admirable leading comrade, but he has too much work..." The editors deleted the first half of the sentence and changed it to: "Comrade Zhou Runxiang has too much work..."

    15. Subsequently, Zhao Huiwen said to Lin Zhen: "Yes, seeing you, my youth seems to have recovered. Since you came to the District Committee, you haven't been indifferent for a single day, you are fearless..." This was rewritten by the editors as: "Yes, seeing you, I seem to be younger again. You often stare at one place without moving, always thinking, like a dreamy child. You also get excited easily, blushing at the slightest thing. But you are also fearless..."

    Eighth Section

    16. At the beginning of this section, the original manuscript briefly narrated Han Changxin's married life, and then wrote about Liu Shiwu: "Liu Shiwu was still so busy, he seized the temporary task and completed it very well, and was praised by the Municipal Party Committee Organization Department. On the third day after criticizing Lin Zhen, he called Wang Qingquan for a talk, but suddenly the Deputy Secretary of the District Committee asked him to attend a meeting on his behalf, so he only talked with Wang Qingquan for fifteen minutes. By the way, Liu Shiwu was recently appointed as the Minister of the Organization Department, he did not respond to this matter." The entire passage from "Liu Shiwu was still so busy" onwards was deleted by the editors. The original manuscript then wrote about Lin Zhen and Zhao Huiwen: "Lin Zhen often went to Zhao Huiwen's home, they talked about the District Committee, how to train themselves, talked about singing, and sometimes ate some water chestnuts or other cheap things. Lin Zhen never asked about Zhao Huiwen's lover, and Zhao Huiwen didn't say anything either. Lin Zhen was more steady than when he first came; he wasn't as easily ignited, and often pondered his environment and the people he met. But his uncompromising eyes were even more innocent, even more firm..." These narratives were also all deleted by the editors.

    17. After dinner, Liu Shiwu talked to Lin Zhen about literary works. The original manuscript wrote: "(Liu Shiwu) said mockingly: 'Party workers are not suitable for reading novels. In novels, they look at life from the front, from below, and only know the results of life. We can look at life from the back, from the side, from above, we know the process of life, or call it the inside story.' Liu Shiwu regained his self-confidence and nonchalant demeanor. 'How do you say?' Lin Zhen asked, staring." The entire passage from "Party workers are not suitable for reading novels" onwards was deleted by the editors.

    18. Later, Liu Shiwu talked about the Public Security Bureau Chief dozing off when attending the Standing Committee to approve party members. The original manuscript wrote: "Lin Zhen said loudly, as if he himself had been insulted... 'It's really strange! Our Minister of the Organization Department can't see the magnificent cause, but only sees so-and-so dozing! ... Maybe you are also dozing off? You look down on our life, and life will not forgive you!' Lin Zhen said angrily and ran out of the office." The entire passage from "It's really strange" onwards was also deleted by the editors.

    Ninth Section

    19. Lin Zhen read the letter written by Wei Heming and others published in the "Beijing Daily." The original manuscript wrote: "He (Lin Zhen) thought: 'Good! It's finally been exposed, the Party newspaper is powerful after all!' He couldn't help but go to Liu Shiwu immediately. Walking to the door of Liu Shiwu's office, he thought: 'Why do I feel a little schadenfreude when the Party newspaper exposes one of our shortcomings?' He blushed, feeling ashamed, but he told himself again: 'The contradiction has been revealed, this is definitely not a "disaster"!" The editors rewrote this passage as: "He thought: 'Good! It's finally been exposed! The time is finally ripe, right!'" The following words were all deleted.

    20. After the meeting to deal with Wang Qingquan's problem, Lin Zhen and Liu Shiwu went to a small shop to eat wontons. Liu talked to Lin about how enthusiastic and young he used to be. Lin Zhen asked him: "Are you not young and enthusiastic now??" The original manuscript then wrote: "Lin Zhen looked with expectant eyes." The editors rewrote it as: "Lin Zhen asked tentatively. He wanted to understand this person, wanted to tease him to say more."

    21. Next, Liu Shiwu talked about "the occupational disease of cooks is a lack of good appetite." The original manuscript then wrote: "...We, Party workers, don't make meals, we create a new life! As a result, life can't excite us. At the same time, the fishy smell of the kitchen also affects the stomach..." The editors deleted some of the sentences and changed it to: "We, Party workers, we create a new life, as a result, life can't excite us. ..."

    22. In the later conversation, Liu Shiwu hinted to Lin Zhen that Zhao Huiwen's feelings for Lin Zhen were somewhat abnormal. Lin Zhen left the wonton shop and returned to the dormitory. Regarding his mood at this time, the original manuscript described: "Lin Zhen sat on the bed, touching the wet corner of his pants, could it be, could it be,..." Because the original manuscript's handwriting was unclear, the editing comrades and proofreading comrades mistakenly identified "could it be" as "sad." The following sentence, "Couldn't say why sad" was added by the editors. Later, there were two more consecutive "could it be," which were also mistakenly identified as "sad." Also, at the end of this paragraph, there were originally these sentences: "He (Lin Zhen) said to himself: 'I have eaten cooked water chestnuts, but that was sour...'" These sentences were deleted by the editors.

    Tenth Section

    23. The District Committee Standing Committee held a meeting to discuss the麻袋厂(Ma dai chang) [jute sack factory] problem. After Lin Zhen spoke, Liu Shiwu spoke next. The original manuscript described it this way: "Liu Shiwu nodded: 'Comrade Lin's opinion is correct, as a "newborn force" of the Organization Department'..." The sentence "as a 'newborn force' of the Organization Department" was deleted by the editors. Then, Liu Shiwu said that the Organization Department had few cadres and could not grasp the consolidation of Party work. "I wrote a report last month, but Lao Li and Lao Zhou didn't solve it either." These two sentences were also deleted by the editors.

    24. Later, the original manuscript wrote about Lin Zhen's speech: "Lin Zhen said softly: 'Yes, I attended that meeting (referring to the meeting to deal with Wang Qingquan's problem at the 麻袋厂(Ma dai chang) [jute sack factory] ), the masses infinitely trust our Party Committee organs. Under the guidance of the Party's wise policies, and under the support and promotion of the Party newspaper and the masses, we have solved the problems for the masses, and the masses treat our Party workers with cheers, applause, and tears because they regard us as representatives of the Party... Precisely because of this, I feel that the numbness, procrastination, and irresponsibility in our work are a deep crime against the masses.'..." The passage from "I attended that meeting" to "they regard us as representatives of the Party" was deleted by the editors. Also, "deep crime" had the three characters "deep" deleted.

    25. At the end of this section, Lin Zhen was criticized by the District Committee Secretary and others at the Standing Committee meeting. When he returned to his room, he took out the novel written with "Live in the way of Nastya" and muttered to himself: "It's really difficult!" After this, there was a single sentence: "What is he missing?" which was deleted by the editors from the original manuscript.

    Eleventh Section

    26. Lin Zhen was invited to Zhao Huiwen's home. Zhao invited Lin to eat dumplings, but Lin Zhen didn't eat them, sitting uneasily to the side. Then there was a psychological description: "That indescribable feeling of warmth and sadness surged into his heart at the same time. His heart was aching, as if he had lost something. He didn't dare to look at Zhao Huiwen's beautiful face, which was reddened by the red clothes." This description was not originally in the original manuscript, it was added by the editors.

    27. Later, Lin Zhen told Zhao Huiwen about his experiences at the District Committee meeting, and Zhao asked Lin what else was on his mind. The original manuscript then wrote: "Lin Zhen's heart beat violently, he raised his head and saw Zhao Huiwen's flawless, well-intentioned eyes, he whispered: 'Comrade Zhao Huiwen...'" This was changed by the editors to: "Lin Zhen's heart beat faster. He raised his head and saw Zhao Huiwen's eyes that sympathized with him and encouraged him, he softly called: 'Comrade Zhao Huiwen...'" Afterwards, Lin Zhen told Zhao Huiwen about Liu Shiwu's hints to him, and then said: "...Maybe that's all nonsense... I really like talking with you or listening to symphonic poems, you are great, I feel close to you, that's natural, just as summer always comes after spring..." The editors deleted some of the sentences and changed it to: "...That's all nonsense... I really like talking with you or listening to symphonies, you are great, that's natural..."

    28. Next, Zhao Huiwen talked about her relationship with her husband. The original manuscript wrote: "...Between us, it seems that only Saturday night back and Monday departure remain. His theory is: Love, it's just that. I thought, either it's sublime love, or there's nothing, we quarreled..." This was changed by the editors to "...Between us, it seems that only Saturday night back and Monday departure remain. His theory is: Either it's sublime love, or there's nothing, we quarreled..."

    29. The ending of this novel was completely rewritten by the editors. The original ending of the novel was like this:

    ...Lin Zhen leaned against the big pillar in front of the Organization Department, standing blankly, he was excited, his heart seemed empty. The early summer south wind blew on him—his pocket contained "The Tractor Station Director and the Chief Agronomist" When he arrived, it was late winter, now it is early summer, and he has spent his first spring in the District Committee.

    Although he has done very little, almost nothing, he has learned a lot, and understands a lot more: he understands the true beauty and true weight of life, he understands the difficulty and value of struggle. He gradually understands that in this ordinary yet great, all-encompassing, and full of severe conflicts District Committee, personal courage alone will not have much effect. From tomorrow...

    Little Liu from the office passed by and called him: "Lin Zhen? Where did you go? Go find Comrade Zhou Runxiang, he just looked for you three times."

    Did the District Committee Secretary look for Lin Zhen? Then, not from tomorrow, but from now on, he must do everything in his power to strive for the guidance of the leadership, which is the most important thing at present. He still doesn't know whether the District Committee Secretary agrees with him, reprimands him, or routinely looks for him to "solicit" opinions; but he believes that his, Zhao Huiwen's, and many young Communist Party members' childish troubles and loyal efforts will eventually receive the enlightened and strong (?) understanding, help, and support of the leadership, and then our District Committee will become what it should truly be.

    Through the window, he saw the green desk lamp and the tall silhouette of the District Committee Secretary working at night. He resolutely and impatiently knocked on the door of the leading comrade's office.

    “人民文学”编辑部对“组织部新来的青年人”原稿的修改情况
    “人民文学”编辑部整理
    本刊编者对“组织部新来的青年人”原稿的修改，有很大一部分是属于文字上的，这里不可能一一列举。现在把牵涉到作品的思想内容、人物形象、人物之间的关系等比较重要的修改列举如下。
    1．据作者现在说小说的原标题是“组织部来了一个年轻人”，稿件登记簿上第一次原稿题目是“组织部新来个年青人”，被编者最后改为“组织部新来的青年人”。
    第一节
    2．林震从刘世吾的办公室里走出来，听到一个房里有打字声，林震想：“她也和我一样，是新调来的吧？”这个“她”字在原稿中本来是“他”字。下面的一句：“林震不知凭什么理由，猜打字员一定是个女的”，也是编者给加上的。
    第二节
    3．赵慧文晚上在办公室里复写文件，林震站在她身旁，帮她把抄过的纸张叠整齐，她一边抄一边抬头看林震。接着原稿中有一段描写：“（赵慧文调皮地）说：‘我说了你可别生气，我绝不是诚心奚落你……’林震催她讲，她说：‘我的儿子长着和你相像的眼睛。’忽然笑声吞没了她的话。林震奇怪地看着她：‘你结过婚了？’赵慧文说：‘当然，我的孩子并不是没有父亲。’林震大笑了，赵慧文却没有笑。”这段描写被编者删去了。
    第五节
    4．这一节开始，原稿中有这样几句叙述：“初到区委会十天的生活，在林震头脑中积累起的印象与产生的问题，比他在小学呆了两年的还多。许多错综的人和事他不能理解。”这几句叙述被编者删去了。
    5．稍后，原稿中有这样几句话：“有时，一眼看去，又觉得区委会干部随意而松懈，他们在办公时间聊天，看报纸，大胆地拿林震在小学时认为最严肃的题目开玩笑……”被编者改为：“有时，又觉得区委干部们的精神状态是随意而松懈的，他们在办公时间聊天，看报纸，大胆地拿林震认为最严肃的题目开玩笑……”
    6．接着，编者在原稿上加进了这样一段话：“奇怪得很，林震说不清他的这个新环境是好是坏。他还是像在小学时一样，每天照样很早就起来玩哑铃，还是照常地给人以‘单纯’的甚至‘天真’的印象。但是，他的内心活动却比在小学的时候多得多。他必须学会判断一切事情和一切人。”
    7．林震去到刘世吾的办公室里，碰到刘正在劝说赵慧文和她的丈夫和好。赵慧文走后，刘世吾对林震说：“赵慧文跟她爱人又闹翻了……”原稿中接着有两句话：“林震不想问赵慧文的事。他被烟气呛得咳了两声。”这两句被编者删去了。
    8．在刘世吾和林震的谈话过程中，原稿中对刘世吾有这样一些描写：他吐着“由于吸入太深而变白了的烟”，他“说话的样子好像在咽什么东西”，他“把椅子拉近林震，椅子腿发出刺耳的嗓音”，关于王清泉，他“‘老兄’‘老兄’地说着，像数落一个不成器的孩子”……这些描写都被编者删去了。
    9．刘世吾说到王清泉，原稿中这样写：“王清泉被派到国民党军队里工作，他作过国民党军队的副团长……他到敌人当中是去瓦解敌人的，但是他自己也染上国民党军官的一些脾气，也染上了病，改不过来……”被编者改为：“王清泉被派到国民党军队里去工作，他作过国民党军的副团长……他是去瓦解敌人的，但是他自己也染上国民党军官的一些习气，改不过来……”接着，刘世吾说：“他的错误是应该批评、纠正的。”被编者改为：“他的错误是不可原谅的。”
    第六节
    10．在党的小组会上，刘世吾批评林震：“一到新的工作岗位”，就想“充当娜斯嘉式的英雄”，这是“一种虚妄”。原稿中接着写道：“林震像被打中似地颤了一下，他的眼白上出现了血丝，紧咬住下嘴唇。”编者改写成：“林震像被打中了一拳似地颤了一下，他紧咬住下嘴唇，忍住了心里的气愤和痛苦。”
    第七节
    11．林震应邀去到赵慧文的家里。原稿中写：“她和林震到家以后，她的母亲休息了。她领林震去看儿子。”“赵慧文低声告诉林震：‘他的眼睛……’（按：前面赵慧文曾对林震说，他的眼睛像她儿子的眼睛。）孩子闭着眼，林震看不出来。”这些字句被编者删去了。
    12．赵慧文和林震谈话时，原稿中对她的动作有这样一句描写：她“一个一个地捏着自己的手指”。被编者改成：她“一个一个地捏着自己那白白的好看的手指”。
    13．赵慧文对林震谈起了刘世吾。原稿中写：“他知道什么是‘是’，什么是‘非’……”编者在这句话之前加上：“按他自己的说法”几个字。又，原稿中在“他……欣赏成绩，仅仅是欣赏”这句话之后，还有这样一句：“就像他处于生活的旋涡之外，公民之外”，编者删去了这句话。此外，原稿中的“他看透了生活”，“他满有把握地应付生活”，其中的“生活”均被改作“一切”；他“再也不需要虔诚地向生活学习什么”，被改作“再也不需要虔诚地学习什么”；“他一把把生活抓在手里”，被改作“他一把把事情抓在手里”；“俨然是生活的上司”，被改作“俨然是一切人的上司”。
    14．林震问起区委书记周润祥同志，赵慧文回答：“周润祥同志是一个非常叫人尊敬的领导同志，但是他的工作太多……”编者把前半句话删去了，改成：“周润祥同志工作太多……”
    15．随后，赵慧文对林震说：“是的，见到你，我的青春好像又恢复了。你来到区委会以后，一天也没冷漠过，你天不怕地不怕……”被编者改写成：“是的，见到你，我好像又年轻了。你常常把眼睛盯在一个地方不动，老是在想，像个爱幻想的孩子。你又挺容易兴奋起来，动不动就红脸。可是，你又天不怕地不怕……”
    第八节
    16．这一节开始，原稿中概略地叙述了韩常新的婚后生活，接着写到了刘世吾：“刘世吾仍然那么忙，他抓紧那个临时任务，完成得很好，受到市委组织部表扬。他在批评林震之后第三天找了王清泉来谈话，临时忽然区委副书记叫他代为参加一个会，于是他只与王清泉谈了十五分钟。对了，刘世吾最近被任命为组织部部长，他对这件事没有反映。”其中自“刘世吾仍然那么忙”以下全被编者删去了。原稿中紧接着又写到了林震和赵慧文：“林震常去赵慧文家，他们谈区委会，谈如何锻炼自己，谈唱歌，谈完了有时候吃点荸荠或者别的便宜的东西。林震没问过关于赵慧文爱人的事，赵慧文也没说。林震比刚来的时候稳重些了；他不那么一点就着，而常常苦苦思索自己的环境和自己碰到的人。但是他的不妥协的眼神却更加天真，更加坚定……”这些叙述也全被编者删去了。
    17．晚饭后，刘世吾同林震谈起文学作品，原稿中写：“（刘世吾）嘲笑地说：‘党工作者不适合看小说。小说里边，那是从正面，从下面来看生活，只知道生活的结果。我们，就可以从背面，从侧面，从上面来看生活，我们知道生活的过程，或者叫作内幕。’刘世吾又恢复了自负和满不在乎的神气。‘怎么讲？’林震注视着问。”其中自“党工作者不适合看小说”以下全被编者删去了。
    18．稍后，刘世吾谈到公安局长参加常委会批准党员时打瞌睡，原稿中写：“林震大声说，他像本人受了侮辱一样……‘真奇怪！我们的组织部部长看不见壮丽的事业，而只看见某某在打瞌睡！……也许您也瞌睡了吧？您瞧不起我们的生活，生活也不会原谅您！’林震怒冲冲地说完，跑出了办公室。”其中自“真奇怪”以下也全被编者删去了。
    第九节
    19．林震读到了“北京日报”刊登的魏鹤鸣等写的信，原稿中这样写：“他（林震）想：‘好！终于揭发出来了，还是党报有力量！’他忍不住马上去找刘世吾。走到刘世吾办公室门前他想了想：‘为什么当党报揭发了我们的一项缺点时我却抱着有点幸灾乐祸的心情呢？’他脸红了，羞愧起来，但他又告诉自己：‘矛盾揭开了，这决不是什么“灾祸”！’”编者把这段话改写成：“他想：‘好！终于揭发出来了！时机总算成熟了吧！’”以下的字句全被删去了。
    20．开完处理王清泉问题的大会以后，林震和刘世吾到小铺吃馄饨，刘对林谈起他过去是多么热情、多么年青，林震问他：“现在就不年青、不热情了?？”原稿中接着写：“林震用期待的眼光看着。”编者改写成：“林震试探着问。他想了解一下这个人，想逗他多说几句。”
    21．接着，刘世吾谈起了“炊事员的职业病是缺乏良好的食欲”，原稿中接着写：“‘……我们，党工作者，作出的不是饭菜，我们缔造了新生活！结果，生活倒不能激动我们。同时，厨房的腥味也影响肠胃……，”编者删除了其中几句，改成：“我们，党工作者，我们创造了新生活，结果，生活反倒不能激动我们。……”
    22．在后来的谈话中，刘世吾暗示林震，赵慧文对林震的感情有些不正常。林震离开馄饨铺回到宿舍，关于他这时的心情，原稿中这样描写：“林震坐在床上，摸着湿了的裤角，难道，难道，……”因原稿字迹不清，编辑同志和校对同志均将“难道”误认为“难过”。下面的一句：“说不清为什么要难过”是编者加上的。稍后还接连有两个“难道”，也都被误认为“难过”。又，在这一段的结尾，本来还有这样几句：“他（林震）自言自语的说：‘我吃过煮熟了的荸荠，但那个是酸的……’”这几句被编者删去了。
    第十节
    23．区委常委开会讨论麻袋厂问题。林震发言后，刘世吾接着发言。原稿中这样描写：“刘世吾点点头：‘小林同志的意见是对的，作为组织部的一位“新生力量”’……”其中“作为组织部的一位‘新生力量’”一句被编者删去了。接着，刘世吾说到组织部干部少，无法抓紧巩固党的工作。“上个月我写了报告，老李老周也不给解决”。这两句也被编者删去了。
    24．稍后，原稿中又写到林震的发言：“林震小声说：‘是的，我参加了那个会（指麻袋厂处理王清泉问题的大会），群众无限地信任我们的党委机关。我们在党的英明的政策指导下面，在党报和群众的支持推动下面，是给群众解决了问题的，群众用欢呼、鼓掌和热泪对待我们的党工作者，因为他们把我们看作党的代表……正因为这样，我才觉得我们工作中的麻木，拖延，不负责任，是对群众的深深的犯罪。’……”其中自“我参加了那个会”至“他们把我们看作党的代表”一段话被编者删去了。又，“深深的犯罪”，被删去“深深的”三个字。
    25．这一节的结尾，林震在常委会上受到区委书记等的批评，回到屋里，拿出那本写着“按娜斯嘉的方式生活”的小说，自言自语：“真难啊！”在这后面还单另有一句：“他缺少了什么呢？”被编者从原稿中删去了。
    第十一节
    26．林震应邀去到赵慧文的家里，赵请林吃饺子，林震不吃，不安地坐在一旁。接着有一段心理描写：“那种说不出来的温暖和难过的感觉又一齐涌上了他的心头。他的心在痛，好像失掉了什么。他简直不敢看赵慧文那张被红衣裳映红了的美丽的脸儿。”这段描写在原稿中本来没有，是编者给加上的。
    27．稍后，林震对赵慧文谈了他在区委会上的遭遇，赵问林还有什么心事。原稿上接着这样写：“林震的心剧烈地跳动，抬起头，看见了赵慧文无瑕的好意的眼睛，他轻叫：‘赵慧文同志……’”被编者改成：“林震的心跳起来了。他抬起头，看见了赵慧文那同情他和鼓励他的眼睛，他轻轻地叫：‘赵慧文同志……’”再后，林震把刘世吾对他的暗示告诉了赵慧文，接着说：“……没准儿那完全是瞎说……我很愿意和你一起说话或者听交响诗，你好极了，我觉得你亲近，那是自然而然的，就像春天过去了总是夏天一样自然……”编者删去了其中几句话，改成：“……那完全是瞎说……我很愿意和你一起说话或者听交响乐，你好极了，那是自然而然的……。”
    28．接着，赵慧文谈起了她和丈夫的关系。原稿中这样写：“……我们之间呢，好像也只剩下了星期六晚上回来和星期一走。他的理论是：爱情嘛，就那么回事。我以为，或者是崇高的爱情，或者什么都没有，我们争吵了……”被编者改成了“……我们之间呢，好像也只剩下了星期六晚上回来和星期一走。他的理论是：或者是崇高的爱情，或者什么都没有，我们争吵了……”
    29．这篇小说的结尾部分，是全部经编者改写过的。小说原来的结尾是这样的：
    ……林震靠着组织部门前的大柱子，呆立着，他兴奋，心里好像空空的。初夏的南风吹拂着他——他衣袋里装着“拖拉机站站长与总农艺师”到来的时候是残冬，现在已经是初夏了，他在区委会度过了第一个春天。
    他作好的事情虽很少，简直就是没有，但是他学了很多，多懂了很多事：他懂了生活的真正的美好和真正的分量，他懂了斗争的困难和斗争的价值。他渐渐明白在这平凡而又伟大的、包罗万象的、充满严峻冲突的区委会，单凭个人的勇气是不会发生多大的效果。从明天……
    办公室的小刘走过，叫他：“林震？你上哪儿去了？快去找周润祥同志，他刚才找了你三次。”
    区委书记找林震了吗？那么，不是从明天，而是从现在，他要尽一切力量去争取领导的指引，这正是目前最重要的。他还不知道区委书记是赞成他，斥责他，还是例行公事地找他“征求征求”意见完事；但是他相信，他的，赵慧文的，许多年青的共产党员的稚气的苦恼和忠诚的努力，总会最后得到领导英明和强力（？）的了解，帮助，和支持，那时我们的区委会就会成为真正应该成为的那个样子。
    隔着窗子，他看见绿色的台灯和夜间办公的区委书记的高大侧影，他坚决地、迫不及待地敲响领导同志办公室的门。
