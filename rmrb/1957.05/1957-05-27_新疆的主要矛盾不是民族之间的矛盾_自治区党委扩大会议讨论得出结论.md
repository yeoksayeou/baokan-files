Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 26th - The enlarged meeting of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, held from April 26th to May 24th, discussed major issues such as the internal contradictions of the people in the autonomous region and the carrying out of rectification.

At the meeting, there were two different opinions on what was the main contradiction among the people in the autonomous region: some believed that the contradiction between leading cadres and the masses was the main one, while a portion believed that the contradiction between nationalities was the main one. After repeated discussions and further presentation of facts, a consensus was finally reached. Everyone agreed that the contradiction between leading cadres and the masses of all nationalities was the main contradiction, and the contradiction between nationalities was secondary. Because based on the analysis of some problems that have already occurred in actual work, the main contradictions exposed are contradictions between leaders and the masses, rather than contradictions between nationalities. The meeting believed that reaching such a conclusion after analysis would guide everyone to concentrate their main efforts on opposing and overcoming the main problems in leadership and work, namely, bureaucratism, subjectivism, and sectarianism. Otherwise, it would neglect and relax efforts in this regard, thinking that it would be enough to oppose Han chauvinism and local nationalism. This is inconsistent with the actual situation and harmful. The meeting believed that it would also be wrong to fail to see national contradictions and their seriousness. The meeting pointed out that in resolving issues related to ethnic relations in the autonomous region, it is necessary to first oppose Han chauvinism.

This enlarged meeting was actually a rectification meeting, marking the beginning of rectification from top to bottom in the autonomous region. At the meeting, members of the Autonomous Region Party Committee and heads of party organizations at all levels, based on the spirit of the Central Committee's instructions on carrying out the rectification movement, combined with the work and actual conditions of their respective regions and departments, made speeches, conducted self-criticism, and examined and criticized errors and shortcomings such as bureaucratism, subjectivism, and sectarianism in leading production and construction, material supply, rational distribution, and ethnic unity. Everyone thereby enhanced their understanding, strengthened party unity, and made ideological preparations for correctly handling internal contradictions among the people and carrying out the rectification movement.

Before the end of the meeting, Secretary Saifuddin spoke, and finally, First Secretary Wang Enmao made a summary. In his summary, Wang Enmao, on behalf of the Autonomous Region Party Committee, made an examination and self-criticism of the shortcomings of the Autonomous Region Party Committee's work style, the handling of internal problems among the people, national issues, ideological and political work issues, and proposed methods for future improvement.

The meeting also seriously studied major issues such as carrying out rectification and implementing the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" and "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision." The meeting pointed out that all localities must make good arrangements for current agricultural production, summer harvest pre-distribution, and the supply of basic necessities during rectification.

    新疆的主要矛盾不是民族之间的矛盾
    自治区党委扩大会议讨论得出结论
    新华社乌鲁木齐26日电　从4月26日到5月24日召开的中共新疆维吾尔自治区委员会扩大会议，讨论了自治区人民内部矛盾和开展整风等重大问题。
    会上，关于什么是自治区人民内部的主要矛盾，曾有两种分歧意见：有人认为领导干部和群众之间的矛盾是主要的，有一部分人认为民族间的矛盾是主要的。经过反复讨论，进一步摆出事实，最后取得了一致的认识。大家认为各族领导干部和群众的矛盾是主要的，民族间的矛盾是次要的。因为就实际工作中已经发生过的一些问题来分析，所暴露出来的主要矛盾都是领导和群众之间的矛盾，而不是民族之间的矛盾。会议认为，经过分析后得出这样的结论，就会引导大家集中主要力量来反对和克服领导和工作中的主要问题即官僚主义、主观主义和宗派主义，否则，就会忽视和放松在这方面的努力，以为只要反对了大汉族主义和地方民族主义就够了。这是不符合实际情况的，有害的。会议认为，看不到民族矛盾和它的严重性，也是错误的。会议指出在解决自治区民族关系方面的问题的时候，必须首先反对大汉族主义。
    这次扩大会议实际上是一次整风的会议，是自治区自上而下整风的开始。会上，自治区党委委员，各地党组织的负责人，根据中央关于开展整风运动指示的精神，结合本地区、本部门的工作和实际情况作了发言，进行了自我批评，检查和批判了在领导生产建设、物资供应、合理分配、民族团结等工作上的官僚主义、主观主义和宗派主义等错误和缺点。大家从而提高了认识，增强了党的团结，为正确处理人民内部矛盾，开展整风运动作好了思想准备。
    会议结束前，书记赛福鼎讲了话，最后第一书记王恩茂作了总结。王恩茂在总结中代表自治区党委就自治区党委的工作作风，关于处理人民内部问题、关于民族问题、关于思想政治工作问题等方面的缺点，作了检查和检讨，并提出了今后改进的办法。
    会议还认真地研究了开展整风，贯彻执行“百花齐放，百家争鸣”，“长期共存，互相监督”的方针等重大问题。会议指出：各地在整风中必须很好安排当前的农业生产、夏收预分，基本生活资料供应等工作。
