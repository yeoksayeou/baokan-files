Court Hearing
Fang Cheng

Act One

Setting: The main hall of the Dogmatism Yamen, with walls plastered with various slogans. In the middle of the hall is a long table piled with books of all kinds - thick, thin, new, old, paperback, and hardcover.

Characters:
    Lord You Qugu (Especially Rigid),
    Zhao Si - a crosstalk comedian,
    Zhang Da - a cartoonist.

(When the curtain rises, Lord You sits in the high seat, with yamen runners standing on both sides. Zhao Si kneels on the left, and Zhang Da prostrates himself on the right.)

Yamen Runner (shouting): Oh—You (to Zhao): You are Zhao Si, the crosstalk comedian?
Zhao: Yes, Your Honor.
You: "Buying a Monkey" and "Night Journey," you said those?
Zhao: Yes, Your Honor.
You: Do you know your crime?
Zhao: This humble citizen has always abided by the law…
You (slams the gavel): !? How dare you, Zhao Si, try to quibble before this official!
Zhao: I beg Your Honor's mercy, this humble citizen is truly innocent.
You: Let me ask you, are the people the enemy?
Zhao: No, Your Honor.
You: So, you understand this principle. But how do you treat the people?
Zhao: This humble citizen has never done anything that goes against heaven or reason.
You (sneering): Such a law-abiding citizen! Let me ask you: Did you witness with your own eyes the actions of Ma Daha (Careless)? Were each and every one of them true and factual?
Zhao: No, Your Honor, those were, those were exaggerated descriptions. Crosstalk is a type of satirical art, and satire requires a bit of exaggeration…
You (angrily): Silence! Do you think this official doesn't understand the art of satire? From childhood, I have been well-versed in the essays of Lu Xun and am proficient in the works of Gogol and Saltykov-Shchedrin. Their satire was directed at the enemy, attacking the undemocratic old society. Does the democratic new society have satirical material too? Are the people in the new society the target of your satire?
Zhao: This humble citizen satirizes those bad ideas and bad work styles left over from the old society, as well as…
You (in a rage): Bah! You're attacking Ma Daha, Comrade Ma Daha! He is our cadre. To this day, he is seriously wounded, unable to laugh or cry, and lying at home in low spirits. He is on the verge of death, are you aware?
Zhao: This—
You (sneering): What this, that. Hmph, and also: Those who don't queue when boarding a bus, whose bicycle brakes don't work, and who don't turn on their lights at night are basically good comrades, and you've all made them lose their appetite and energy for work. What kind of loss has this caused to the country, have you calculated it?
Zhao: This humble citizen…
You: Get down! Await this official's sentence another day!

You (to Zhang): You are Zhang Da, the cartoonist?
Zhang: Yes, Your Honor, this humble one is Zhang Da, the cartoonist.
You: Is it you who draws pencils as awls for making shoe soles, draws cadres as gramophone horns, and says people are worse than crows?
Zhang: This humble one dares not. This humble citizen is sharply criticizing pencils that are too hard and not suitable for use; criticizing those cadres who parrot others and don't use their brains, and those who are unfilial to their parents…
You (angrily): Nonsense! Is satire equal to criticism? Can bitterness replace sharpness? Are all domestically produced pencils as hard as awls? Do our cadres have no merits at all? This is purely one-sided, picky, audacious, and reckless, truly outrageous! Why don't you draw their good points? Is our society really such a mess! What is your position? (To the outside) Someone, check Zhang Da's history!
Zhang: Reporting to Your Honor, this humble citizen…
You: Get down! Await this official's sentence another day!
(The curtain slowly falls)

Act Two
Setting: As before
Characters: As before
(When the curtain rises, Lord You Qugu reads the verdict.)

You: Having tried Zhao Si and Zhang Da, who are,
    respectively, artists and painters,
    They actually fail to distinguish between friend and foe,
    Indiscriminately engaging in crosstalk and cartoons.
    Satire replaces criticism,
    Deliberately distorting and exaggerating.
    Internal contradictions among the people,
    Are instead made more complex.
    How can we be acerbic and vitriolic,
    Towards our own comrades?
    Criticism is, of course, permissible,
    But the attitude must first be examined.
    Humble, peaceful, and fair,
    Guarantees no deviation.
    Like treating and saving people,
    We must use painless therapy.
    An injection is not as good as medicine,
    Clearing heat is not necessary to pull teeth.
    Everyone understands this principle,
    Why should this official have to say it?
    Undermining the unity of the people,
    The trial has revealed the truth.
    Considering that they are first-time offenders and ignorant,
    The handling will be lenient at discretion.
    Each will receive fifty strokes,
    And must change profession and return home.

Zhao, Zhang (together): Your Honor…
You: Change your profession and go home!

(The curtain quickly falls. The sound of spanking can be heard.)

    过堂
    方成
    第一幕
    布景：教条衙门大堂，墙上贴满各色标语。大堂中间一张长案，案上堆着厚的、薄的、新的、旧的、平装的、精装的书。人物：老爷尤其固，
      赵四——相声艺人，
      张大——漫画家。
    开幕时，老爷坐高堂，衙役站两旁，赵四跪左面，张大伏右厢。衙役（喝堂）：哦——尤（向赵）：说相声的赵四就是你吗？赵：是，大人。尤：“买猴儿”“夜行记”可都是你说的？赵：是，大人。尤：你可知罪？赵：小民一贯守法……尤（把惊堂木一拍）：?！胆大的赵四，在本官面前还敢狡赖！赵：求大人恩典，小民实在没有罪。尤：我来问你，人民可是敌人吗？赵：不是，大人。尤：如此说来，你也懂得这个道理。可是，你是怎样对待人民的？赵：小民从未干过伤天害理之事。尤（冷笑）：好个守法良民！我且问你：马大哈所行所为，你可亲见，桩桩是真，件件属实？赵：不，大人，那是，那是夸张的描写。相声是一种讽刺的艺术，讽刺就要有一点儿夸张……尤（怒）：住口！你欺本官不懂讽刺艺术吗？本官自幼熟读鲁迅杂文，精通果戈里、谢德林诸般巨作。他们讽刺乃对敌人，打击的是不民主旧社会。难道民主的新社会也有讽刺材料不成！新社会里的人民是你讽刺的吗？赵：小民讽刺的就是那些从旧社会里留下的坏思想，坏作风，以及……尤（大怒）：呸！你打击的是马大哈，马大哈同志！他乃是我们的干部。至今身负重伤，哭笑不得，意志消沉，躺卧家中。命在旦夕，你可知晓？赵：这个——尤（冷笑）：什么这个那个。哼哼，还有呐：那些上车不排队的，骑车闸不灵的，夜行不点灯的基本上是善良的同志们，都被你打得茶饭无心，工作无神。这给国家造成何等损失，你可计算过不曾？赵：小民……尤：下去！听候本官改日宣判！尤（向张）：你就是画漫画的张大吗？张：是，大人，小的就是画漫画的张大。尤：将铅笔画成纳鞋底子的锥子，把个干部画成留声机的喇叭，说人不如乌鸦的，就是你吗？张：小的不敢。小民是在尖锐地批评铅笔太硬，不合用；批评那些人云亦云，不动脑筋的干部和不孝父母之人……尤（怒）：混帐！讽刺等于批评吗？刻薄能代替尖锐吗？难道国产铅笔都像锥子那么硬吗？我们的干部就毫无可取之处吗？这纯是片面，挑剔，胆大，妄为，真真岂有此理！你为什么不画他们的优点呢？难道我们的社会就这么一团糟！你的立场是什么？（向外）来人哪，查查张大的历史！张：回禀大人，小民……尤：下去！听候本官改日宣判！
                        （幕徐落）
          第二幕布景：如前人物：同上开幕时，老爷过于固宣读判决书。尤：审得赵四张大　身为艺人画家
    居然敌我不分　乱搞相声漫画
    讽刺代替批评　故意歪曲夸大
    人民内部矛盾　反而使之复杂
    对待自己同志　岂可尖酸泼辣
    批评当然可以　态度先要检查
    谦逊和平中正　保险不出偏差
    好比治病救人　须用无痛疗法
    打针莫如吃药　清火不必拔牙
    此理人人都懂　何待本官说话
    破坏人民团结　审得真真不假
    姑念初犯无知　处理酌情宽大
    各打五十大板　着即改业还家赵张（同声）：大人哪……尤：改行回家去吧！
    （幕急落。犹闻打屁股之声。）
