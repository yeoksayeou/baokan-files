Xinhua News Agency, May 26th, dispatch from Paris via TASS: The Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party issued a statement on the 25th, calling on the French working people and those who uphold democracy to unite and "resolutely block the path of fascist adventurism" and to counter their shameless atrocities.

The Political Bureau issued the statement in response to the attack by fascist thugs on the office building jointly used by the French Communist Party's Montpellier office and many democratic organizations in Dijon (the French Women's Union, the French Communist Youth League, the French Girls' Youth League, and the France-Soviet Association). The statement pointed out the danger of the growing fascist threat in France. Incited by government policies, the saboteurs are trying to seize the opportunity of the current government crisis to intensify their activities. The statement said that the fascists are hoping for a more reactionary government to come to power.
