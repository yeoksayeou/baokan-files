    Improving Political Education and Graduate Job Assignment
    Ministry of Higher Education Invites Students to Symposium
    (Our newspaper reports) The Political Education Department and Student Management Department of the Ministry of Higher Education convened separate symposiums on the 18th, inviting students from some universities. The comrades from the Ministry of Higher Education said that the ideological and political education work in schools had many shortcomings in the past, and the graduate job assignment work was not done well enough. Now we invite students to offer suggestions to help us do a better job in the future.
    Many students reflected that the school's ideological and political education work was generally poor, and the teaching quality was not high. Qiu Yuliang, a student from the Western Languages Department of Peking University, said that teachers lectured more on principles and less on combining them with specific problems for analysis, and gave less specific guidance to students. At the same time, there was serious dogmatism in teaching. Xu Ligong, a student from the Agricultural Economics Department of Beijing Agricultural University, said that when explaining the definition of a nation, very few Chinese examples were used. Many students hoped that school political instructors and Youth League cadres could become role models for students in their daily lives through their words and actions. Many students also requested that more positive political and ideological education be conducted in schools in the future, and that more comrades who participated in the revolutionary struggle be invited to give reports at the school.
    Many students who attended the symposium also raised opinions on the past assignment work. Xiao Yongyi, a student from the Law Department of Renmin University of China, said that 80% of the students who graduated from our Law Department last year were assigned to various central ministries and schools, and only a few were assigned to judicial organs. Some were even assigned to do Party work. Therefore, some students said that those who studied law were "jack-of-all-trades cadres." Many students also criticized the rigid attitude of relevant departments in assigning graduates, and the working style of forcefully persuading people with "labels." They hoped that the assignment plan would be announced as soon as possible, and that students' wishes would be taken into consideration as much as possible. If it was impossible to accommodate them, it would be necessary to explain clearly again and again, and not to pressure people with "labels." Some students suggested not assigning newly graduated college students to do research work, but it would be better to select some outstanding people from the work posts to do graduate studies.
    Some students from eleven universities, including Peking University, Beijing Agricultural University, and Tsinghua University, participated in the symposium.

    改进政治课和毕业生分配工作
    高等教育部邀请学生座谈
    本报讯　高等教育部政治教育司和学生管理司于18日召集部分高等学校学生，分别举行座谈会。高等教育部的同志说，过去学校的思想政治教育工作有许多缺点，毕业生分配工作也做得不够好。现在请同学们提出意见，帮助我们做好今后的工作。
    许多学生反映，学校思想政治教育工作一般化，教学质量不高。北京大学西语系学生仇玉良说，教师讲课讲原则性的东西多，结合具体问题分析少，对学生的具体指导少，同时在教学中存在着严重的教条主义。北京农业大学农业经济系学生徐立功说，讲民族定义时，很少用中国的东西来说明民族的定义。许多同学希望学校政治教员和团的干部，在日常生活中，一言一行，能成为同学们的榜样。还有许多学生要求今后在学校里多进行正面的政治思想教育，多请参加过革命斗争的同志到学校来做报告。
    到会的许多同学对过去的分配工作也提出意见。中国人民大学法律系学生肖永义说，我们法律系去年毕业的学生80％分配到中央各部和学校，只有很少的学生分配到司法机关，还有的分配去作党的工作，因而，有的同学说，学法律的是“万金油干部”。还有许多学生对有关部门分配毕业生的态度生硬，硬以“帽子”服人的工作作风提出了批评。他们希望早日公布分配方案，尽量照顾学生的志愿，实在不能照顾的时候，需要再三解释清楚，不要用“帽子”压人。有的学生建议不要把刚毕业的大学生分配去做研究工作，最好从工作岗位上选拔一部分优秀的人来做研究生。
    参加座谈会的有北京大学、北京农业大学、清华大学等十一个高等学校的部分学生。
