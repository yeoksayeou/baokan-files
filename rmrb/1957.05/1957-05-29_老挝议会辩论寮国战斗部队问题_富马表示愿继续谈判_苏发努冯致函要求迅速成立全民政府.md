Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 28th: Vientiane Dispatch: The Lao National Assembly began debating the issue of the Lao Fighting Units on the 27th.

    Prime Minister Phouma said at the meeting that despite the setbacks in negotiations with Laos over the past few months, he intends to continue negotiations. He outlined his plan as follows: "To continue the efforts that have already been made within the full and indivisible sovereignty of the legitimate government." Phouma asked the National Assembly to decide whether the path he is following is correct.

    Prince Souphanouvong, leader of the Lao Fighting Units, wrote a long letter to the National Assembly. In the letter, he suggested that the members of parliament, together with the Lao Fighting Units and all the people of Laos, should support the Kingdom's government in continuing negotiations in order to promptly form a government of national unity and achieve the reunification of the Kingdom.

    Souphanouvong mentioned the statements made by Crown Prince Savang Vatthana, Vice-King Phetsarath, and Prime Minister Phouma in favor of a policy of peace and neutrality. He went on to say that the Lao people, including those in the Lao area, support these statements. They were gratified to see that these propositions had begun to be realized, and they fervently hoped that they would be followed by other, more important, positive actions.

    The letter concluded by expressing confidence that the members of parliament would consider implementing the joint communiqué of December 28th of last year, especially the passage in the communiqué concerning the formation of a expanded government of national unity. He believed that the members of parliament would consider the suggestions he had put forward.

    老挝议会辩论寮国战斗部队问题
    富马表示愿继续谈判
    苏发努冯致函要求迅速成立全民政府
    据新华社河内28日电　万象消息：老挝国民议会27日开始辩论寮国战斗部队的问题。
    富马首相在会上说，尽管过去几个月同寮国的谈判遭到了挫折，他打算继续进行谈判。他概述他的计划是：“在合法政府的充分的、不可分割的主权范围之内继续进行已经进行的努力。”富马请求国民议会决定他所遵循的途径是否正确。
    寮国战斗部队领袖苏发努冯亲王写了一封长信给国民议会。他在信中建议议员们同寮国战斗部队和老挝全体人民一道支持王国政府继续进行谈判，以求迅速组成全民团结的政府和实现王国的重新统一。
    苏发努冯提到王储萨旺·瓦达纳、副国王佩差拉和首相富马发表的赞成和平中立政策的言论。他接着说，老挝人民，包括寮国地区的人民在内，都支持这些言论。他们感到欣慰地看见这些主张已经开始实现，他们热烈希望继之以其他更加重要的积极行动。
    这封信最后表示相信议员们将考虑执行去年12月28日的联合公报，特别是公报中关于成立全民团结的扩大政府的一段。他相信议员们会考虑他所提出的建议。
