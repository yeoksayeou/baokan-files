Persuading Relatives and Friends Who Blindly Enter the City to Return to Their Hometowns

    (Our newspaper reporter Kang Weizhong reports) The number of farmers blindly flowing into Harbin is increasing day by day. According to a recent investigation, there are currently more than 20,000 people in the city. This is an important contradiction among the people in the local area.

    Investigation materials prove that almost all people who blindly flow into the city have relatives in the city. Many farmers enter the city only after their relatives in the city send them travel expenses, and they mostly live in the homes of relatives after entering the city. Many people cannot find work for a long time, live in their relatives' homes for a long time, and burden their relatives. Farmers blindly flowing into the city not only affects the future, family income, and improvement of life of these young farmers, and will inevitably affect the development of agricultural production, but also increases certain tensions in urban labor employment, food, housing, and material supply. The Harbin leadership feels that the phenomenon of farmers blindly entering the city cannot be allowed to continue to develop.

    Recently, the Harbin Municipal People's Committee instructed the Civil Affairs Bureau and the Labor Bureau to jointly establish an office to handle the problem of farmers blindly entering the city. Currently, this office has conducted investigation and registration of farmers who have blindly flowed into the city, and has held separate symposiums to persuade them to return to their hometowns as soon as possible to participate in agricultural production. For some farmers who have real difficulties returning to their hometowns but are willing to participate in agricultural production, the office is responsible for organizing them to participate in agricultural production in various counties of the province. Now, after persuasion and education, more than 1,500 farmers in the city have gone to Yi'an, Bei'an, Mulan, and Hailun in Heilongjiang Province to participate in production. More than 300 farmers have also returned to their hometowns. In order to do this work well and prevent farmers from continuing to flow into the city, in the future, in addition to continuing to widely mobilize and persuade farmers who blindly enter the city, the government will also mobilize the masses and workers in the city to assist the government in doing this work. On the one hand, it is calling on the masses and workers to mobilize relatives and friends who blindly enter the city and live in their homes to return to their hometowns to participate in production, and to write letters to persuade those relatives and friends who are not content with agricultural production and want to find jobs in the city to be content with agricultural production and not blindly enter the city; at the same time, they should not write letters to indiscriminately pull relatives and friends into the city. The Harbin Municipal People's Committee also requires all units to conscientiously implement the State Council's regulations on the unified allocation of labor, further strengthen the allocation and management of labor, and prohibit the indiscriminate recruitment of workers.

### 劝导盲目进城的亲友回乡

    劝导盲目进城的亲友回乡
    本报讯　本报记者康伟中报道：盲目流入哈尔滨市的农民日渐增多了。根据最近调查，目前全市就有两万多人。这是当前当地人民内部的一项重要的矛盾。
    调查材料证明，盲目流入城市的人在城市里差不多都有亲属。许多农民是在城市的亲属寄去路费以后才进城的，他们进城以后也多住在亲属家里。许多人因为长期找不到工作，久居亲属家里，又使亲属们背上了包袱。农民盲目流入城市，不仅影响了这些青年农民的前途、家庭收入和生活的改善，势必影响农业生产的发展，而且也增加了城市劳动就业、粮食、住房和物资供应方面的某些紧张。哈尔滨市领导机关感到不能放任农民盲目进城的现象继续发展下去。
    最近，哈尔滨市人民委员会责成民政局、劳动局联合成立了处理农民盲目进城问题的办公室。目前，这个办公室已经对盲目流进城市的农民进行了调查登记，并分别召开了座谈会，劝导他们赶快返乡参加农业生产。对返回原籍确实有困难、而又自愿参加农业生产的一些农民，办公室负责组织他们到本省各县参加农业生产。现在全市已有一千五百多农民经说服教育后，分别到黑龙江省伊安、北安、木兰、海伦参加生产。返回原籍的农民也有三百多人。为了做好这项工作，并防止农民继续流入城市，今后，政府除继续向盲目进城的农民进行广泛动员说服外，还要发动全市广大群众和职工协助政府作好这项工作。一方面是号召广大群众和职工动员居住在自己家中的盲目流入城市的亲友返乡生产，并且写信劝阻那些不安心于农业生产，想到城市求职的亲友安心于农业生产，不要盲目进城；同时更不要写信乱拉亲友进城。哈尔滨市人民委员会还要求各单位认真贯彻执行国务院关于劳动力统一调配的规定，进一步加强劳动力的调配、管理，禁止乱招收工人。
