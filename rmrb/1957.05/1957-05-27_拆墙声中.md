    Amidst the Sounds of Demolishing Walls

    The "wall" between the Party and non-Party members that many people talk about now is actually just a metaphor, a figurative adjective. As the saying goes, "You won't know if you don't speak, you won't penetrate wood if you don't drill it." As long as there is sincerity between each other, and with a little guidance, this wall will be destroyed in an instant. Recently, at various symposiums, some non-Party members have sharply criticized some fundamental issues in the work of the Party and the state. This kind of unreserved criticism is a courageous act of demolishing the wall.

    Anyone who loves the motherland, loves the people, and loves the Party deeply hates that wall that obstructs mutual exchange between the Party and non-Party members, regardless of who built it. A strong sense of love and hate will drive people to immediately take action to demolish it. Everyone must take action to demolish it. You remove a brick, I remove a stone, and no one should stand idly by. Even the Foolish Old Man could move a mountain. How can we fear not being able to level a mere man-made wall, as long as we persevere?

    Of course, there are still people who do not want to demolish the wall, but in today's world where everyone is calling for demolition and everyone wants to demolish it, such people are, after all, lonely. However, there are also people who are deliberately watching, standing aside with white gloves and pointing fingers, saying, "If you don't demolish it, I won't move!" Or they pretend to be humble and say, "You go first, you go first!" They even want people to issue an insurance policy, guaranteeing that no one will build the wall again, that no one will add to the wall, before they will take action. This may not win the sympathy of others. Guo Min

### 拆墙声中

    拆墙声中
    现在许多人所说党内外之间的“墙”，其实也不过是一个比喻，一个形象的形容词。俗语说得好：“人不说不知，木不钻不透”，只要彼此相见以诚，经人一点，这墙就会毁于一旦。最近在各个座谈会上一些党外人士，尖锐地批评了党和国家的工作中的一些带根本性的问题，这种无所顾忌的批评就是一种勇敢的拆墙行为。
    只要是爱祖国、爱人民、爱党的人，谁都深恶痛绝那阻碍党内外互相往来的墙的，不管它的建筑者是谁。强烈的爱憎感会驱使人马上动手来拆。人人都要动手拆，你拆一块砖，我拆一片石，谁也不应该袖手旁观。愚公尚可移山，区区的人为墙，只要锲而不舍，还怕平毁不了么？
    不想拆墙的人当然也还是有的，但在人人喊拆，大家要拆的今天，这样的人毕竟是孤独的。然而也有人存心观望，戴着白手套站在一旁指手划脚地说：“你不拆，我也不动！”或貌似谦逊地说：“您先拆，您先拆！”甚至要人开保单，保证不再有人造墙，不再有人墙上加墙，自己才动手。这就未必能博得别人的同情了。　郭敏
