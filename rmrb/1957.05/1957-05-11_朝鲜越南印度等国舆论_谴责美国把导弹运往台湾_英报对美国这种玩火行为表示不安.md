Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Public opinion in North Korea, Vietnam, India and other countries has condemned the United States' playing-with-fire act of transporting missiles to Taiwan.

The North Korean "Rodong Sinmun" published a short commentary on the 10th, saying that the United States' act of transporting missiles into Taiwan is a provocative act by the United States in attempting to occupy the Chinese people's territory of Taiwan for a long time, interfering in China's internal affairs, and stepping up military activities in the Far East. This also shows that the United States is attempting to threaten the Chinese people and the Asian people with atomic weapons and has no sincerity in prohibiting nuclear weapons. The commentary said that the Korean people believe that the United States' conspiracy to turn Taiwan into its atomic weapons base is a provocation against the entire Asian people, and the Korean people resolutely condemn this act. This behavior of the United States can only expose its ferocious face as an aggressor in front of the Asian people. The Chinese people's determination to liberate Taiwan and the Asian people's determination to fight for peace and national independence will never waver.

The Vietnamese "Nhan Dan" said in a commentary on the 10th that the United States' equipping of atomic missiles in Taiwan will not scare the 600 million Chinese people. The newspaper condemned the United States' behavior of equipping missiles in Taiwan, believing that it is a serious threat to the peace and tranquility of all nations in the world. The newspaper pointed out that this action by the United States is part of its entire plan to prepare for war in Europe and Asia.

The "Indian Times" published an editorial on May 10 saying: The United States' decision to transport atomic missiles to Taiwan "directly infringes on the interests of Asia." The editorial said: "The Bandung countries and those who advocate Panchsheel cannot continue to remain indifferent to this provocative and extreme step."

The editorial said, "The United States has neither the legal nor the moral right to transport atomic weapons to Asia, thereby provoking a new wave of hostility and suspicion in the region, which in recent months has significantly eliminated dangerous tensions."

The "Indian Times" pointed out that when American leaders are indulging in this "atomic madness," it is precisely when the leaders of People's China are trying their best to resolve the Taiwan issue through peaceful means. Therefore, this decision confirms China's concern: the United States is taking action with stubborn hostility.

Xinhua News Agency, May 10th: London dispatch: The British "Daily Telegraph" on the 9th expressed unease about the United States' measure of setting up missiles capable of carrying atomic warheads in Taiwan. The Conservative Party newspaper asked: "Does this mean that the United States is currently basing its military planning work on the assumption that nuclear weapons will be used even in local wars?"

The "Daily Telegraph" said: "The news from Taiwan emphasizes how urgent this issue is."

    朝鲜越南印度等国舆论
    谴责美国把导弹运往台湾
    英报对美国这种玩火行为表示不安
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：朝鲜、越南和印度等国舆论，纷纷谴责美国把导弹运往台湾的玩火行为。
    朝鲜“劳动新闻”10日发表短评说，美国把导弹运入台湾的行为，是美国企图长期强占中国人民的领土台湾，干涉中国内政，加紧远东军事活动的一个挑衅行为。这还说明，美国企图以原子武器威胁中国人民和亚洲人民，对禁止核子武器毫无诚意。评论说，朝鲜人民认为，美国要把台湾变成他的原子武器基地的阴谋是对整个亚洲人民的挑衅，朝鲜人民坚决斥责这种行为。美国的这种行为只能在亚洲人民面前暴露出它的侵略者的凶恶面目。中国人民解放台湾的决心和亚洲人民为和平和民族独立而斗争的决心绝不会动摇。
    越南“人民报”10日在一篇评论里说，美国在台湾装备原子导弹是吓不倒中国六亿人民的。报纸谴责美国在台湾装备导弹的行为，认为这是对世界各民族和平安宁的严重威胁。报纸指出，美国的这一行动，是它在欧亚地区准备战争的整个计划的一部分。
   “印度时报”5月10日发表社论说：美国把原子导弹运往台湾的决定“直接地侵犯了亚洲的利益”。社论说：“万隆国家和那些赞成潘查希拉的国家不能够继续对这个挑衅的和极端的步骤漠不关心”。
    社论说，“美国既没有法律上的也没有道义上的权利把原子武器运往亚洲，从而在这个地区挑起新的敌意和猜疑浪潮，而这个地区在近几个月来已经显著地消除了危险的紧张局势”。
   “印度时报”指出，美国领袖们耽迷于这种“原子核疯狂”的时候，正是人民中国的领袖们正在尽力设法通过和平的方法来解决台湾问题的时候。因此，这个决定证实了中国的这种担忧：美国是本着顽固的敌意来采取行动的。
    据新华社10日讯　伦敦消息：英国“每日电讯报”9日对美国在台湾设置能够装载原子弹头的导弹的措施表示不安。这家保守党的报纸问道：“这是不是意味着美国目前把它的军事计划工作以这种假定为根据，这就是即使在局部性战争里，也将使用核武器？”
   “每日电讯报”说：“来自台湾的消息强调说明了这个问题是多么的迫切。”
