Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 4th -- Xinhua News Agency reporter Fang Ling reports: Huang Huoqing, First Secretary of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Mayor of Tianjin, along with more than fifty party and government cadres including secretaries of the Municipal Committee Secretariat and deputy mayors of Tianjin, went to the Tianjin University construction site today to join workers in constructing dormitory buildings for university students. This is the first time they have participated in physical labor in the eight years since they entered the city. According to a person in charge of the Municipal Committee, they will establish a system of regularly participating in physical labor in the future. Recently, they also plan to go to shops and public canteens to help shop assistants and service personnel. Through various voluntary labor activities, they aim to strengthen their ties with the masses and improve their ideological and work levels.

As soon as Huang Huoqing arrived at the earthwork team, he took on the task of filling baskets. Zhang Jiaxin, a young soil carrier, saw that he was strong and moved quickly, and decided to carry two baskets at a time for him to fill. Huang Huoqing filled each basket to the brim and compacted it, never affecting their continuous carrying work. Zhang Jiaxin said in amazement, "This old comrade is really capable!" Huang Huoqing immediately asked, "Who says I'm old! Let's have a competition!" A competition made them even more active.

At the other end of the construction site, Zhou Wenquan, the leader of the earthwork team, was teaching Li Gengtao, Secretary of the Municipal Committee and Deputy Mayor, the technique of filling baskets; another Deputy Mayor, Song Jingyi, with a towel wrapped around his head, was mixing ash on the side; Li Quanchao, the Minister of the Municipal Committee's Political and Legal Department, who was born as a hired worker and is an old Communist Party member, was working with particular enthusiasm. After finishing his own work, he immediately helped others. Someone told reporters that Li Quanchao was a reclamation expert in Yan'an, and he exceeded the production quota every year; this time everyone took care of him because of his age and weak body, and repeatedly advised him not to come, but he insisted on participating in physical labor. He said, "These years of sitting in the office have made me lose my laboring strength. The more I sit, the more I feel that my progress is slow. Participating in physical labor this time can be considered another opportunity for progress."

The workers were very excited to see the enthusiastic labor of these responsible cadres. In order to take care of the safety of these responsible cadres, the workers did not let them carry heavy baskets of soil down to the foundation pit; they formed a temporary relay team on the springboard leading to the foundation pit,抢着接运土筐; during the break, the workers enthusiastically sent large bowls of plain water and chatted with them about their families. The entire construction site presented a cordial atmosphere. Zhou Wenquan, the leader of the earthwork team, said, "Working with the mayors is the first time in my life, and this is a great encouragement to us! Today my work efficiency can be increased at least threefold."

As the sun set, when these leading cadres were about to leave the construction site, the workers automatically gathered to bid farewell to them and shouted slogans, guaranteeing to over fulfill the task! Huang Huoqing said on behalf of everyone when bidding farewell to the workers: "We are here to learn from you. We all started from labor, and we must not forget our roots." At this time, the workers enthusiastically applauded and shook hands with Huang Huoqing to say goodbye. (Attached picture)

    和建筑工人一起装筐抬土
    天津党政负责干部参加建筑工地劳动
    据新华社天津4日电　新华社记者方凌报道：中共天津市委员会第一书记、天津市市长黄火青和市委书记处的书记、天津市的副市长等五十多个党政负责干部，今天到天津大学建筑工地和工人们一起参加了为大学生建筑宿舍大楼的劳动。这是他们进入城市八年多以来第一次参加体力劳动。据市委负责人说，今后他们将建立起定期参加体力劳动的制度。最近他们还准备到商店、公共食堂去帮助售货员和服务员工作。通过各种义务劳动，密切和群众的联系，提高自己的思想水平和工作水平。
    黄火青刚一来到灰土工程队，就担任了装筐的任务。年青的抬土工张家信看他力气不小，动作很快，决定自己一口气抬两个筐让他来装，黄火青把每一筐都装得满满地而且压了又压，从不影响他们川流不息地抬运工作。张家信惊异地说：“这位老同志可真行啊！”黄火青立即问道：“谁说我老了！咱们比比看！”于是一场竞赛又使他们更加活跃起来。
    工地另一头，灰土小组长周文泉正在教市委书记、副市长李耕涛掌握装筐技术；另一位副市长宋景毅头上包着毛巾，在一旁拌灰；雇工出身的老共产党员、市委政法部部长李权超，干得特别起劲，他干完了自己的活又紧接着帮助别人干活。有人告诉记者说，李权超当年在延安时，是个开荒能手，每年都超额完成生产任务；这次大家照顾他年纪大身体弱，曾几次劝他不要来，但是他坚持参加体力劳动。他说：“这几年坐办公室都把劳动的劲坐掉了，越坐越觉得自己进步慢。这下参加体力劳动，可算又得到一个进步机会。”
    工人们见到这些负责干部的热情劳动的情景十分激动。工人们为了照顾这些负责干部的安全，不让他们抬着沉重的土筐下到基坑里；在通往基坑的跳板组成临时接力队抢着接运土筐；在休息的时候，工人们热情地送来大碗白开水，并和他们谈家常。整个工地呈现出一片亲切的气氛。灰土小组组长周文泉说：“和市长们一起劳动，是我有生以来第一次，这对我们鼓舞太大了！今天我的劳动效率至少可以增加三倍。”
    当夕阳西下，这些领导干部即将离开工地时，工人们自动聚集起来欢送他们，并且高呼口号，保证超额完成任务！黄火青代表大家向工人告别时说：“我们是来向你们学习的。咱们都是劳动起家，不能忘本。”这时候，工人们激动地鼓起掌来，并争着和黄火青握手告别。（附图片）
