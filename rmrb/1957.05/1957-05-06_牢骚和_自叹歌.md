Some people who do ideological work pay close attention to the various "gripes" expressed by those under their supervision. In the past, they valued these "gripes" from below because they could discover people's true thoughts from them. After collecting such gripes, they take three different approaches: one is to have individual talks, criticizing them for being too liberal or spreading rumors; the second is to record it in the books, waiting for the year-end appraisal or life criticism meeting to settle the score, generally saying that they are prone to complaining, have a weak sense of organization, and, more seriously, are criticized for spreading discontent and undermining the authority of the leadership; the third is to publicly name names at mass meetings, saying that so-and-so said something inappropriate, using it as a typical example of some incorrect thinking, and criticizing it thoroughly. The person named has no opportunity to defend themselves, and from then on, it is difficult for them to hold their head high.

Those who are called for individual talks or named at meetings inevitably wonder and regret: I was just talking casually in private, who reported on me? As a result, they associate it with Party members and members of the Communist Youth League. This alienates these people from our Party and the Communist Youth League, and creates a certain sense of caution towards Party members and League members. Of course, I can also criticize this association here as a groundless suspicion, and the characteristic of being suspicious is said to be most common among the petty bourgeoisie.

Such criticism is naturally easy. But it not only fails to solve ideological problems, but only deepens the divide. The root cause is that these comrades engaged in ideological work have problems with their own thinking. First, they are subjectivist, lacking dialectical research and investigation of "gripes," regarding all "gripes" as rebellious; they are sectarian, because they only believe the reports of certain Party members or activists, leading those who are prone to complaining to a position of opposition to the Party and the Communist Youth League; they are also bureaucratic, because they do not allow people below to speak their dissatisfaction, and do not like to hear satirical criticism.

It must be understood that a gripe is a cry of injustice, and "injustice" is the location of contradictions; and in the absence of a democratic atmosphere, when channels for expressing opinions are blocked and the situation below cannot reach the top, it is transformed into "gripes" among a few close friends. Of course, there are certainly many unhealthy and negative factors in gripes, such as hearsay, embellishment, personal prejudices, and extremes; the problem should not only focus on this aspect, but also see that there are many noteworthy things in gripes, such as the frank exposure of thoughts; sharp, bottom-up exposure, where various opposing views can be heard; and warnings about errors and shortcomings in our work, which are often not heard in formal meetings. For a long time, we have only seen the negative side of "gripes," and have not seen that "gripes" also contain something else. Furthermore, we are not good at turning negative things into positive things. As a result, the "gripes" from below are regarded as "liberalism" or "spreading dissatisfaction," and measures are taken to suppress and prohibit them, and those who complain are placed in the ranks of "backward elements," simply wanting to shut people's mouths with one hand. The result is that the original contradictions are not resolved, but new contradictions are added. As the ancients said: preventing the people's mouths is more difficult than preventing a river. Gripes cannot be blocked.

I am not advocating that everyone should complain. But I believe that gripes are also a supplementary means when democracy is insufficient. Wherever there are many gripes, the democratic life there must be abnormal, and the leaders there generally do not like to listen to the opinions of the masses. Therefore, if you want people to not complain or complain less, the proper way is to greatly promote democracy and truly respect the opposing views from below; secondly, you should analyze the critical parts contained in the "gripes," learn to use various opposing views to check our work, seek improvement from the positive aspects, that is, take the essence and discard the dross, and explain and persuade the unhealthy factors in "gripes," such as exaggerating facts, personal prejudices, excessive demands, etc. This explanation and persuasion should not be named in the conference, and should not involve specific people. A sincere and friendly attitude should be adopted in appropriate occasions to briefly explain. Sometimes, there is no need to explain or criticize. We should have the magnanimity of "a prime minister's belly can hold a boat," and there is no need to worry about two or three rumors from below.

Recently, I read an article by Gan Niu published in the Liberation Daily, "Trying to Revise 'Songs of Self-Pity'," which quoted several interesting modern folk songs. In my opinion, these folk songs are actually similar to "gripes," but they have adopted artistic and figurative means. For example, one of them says: "A good woman does not marry a train conductor, spending two nights out of every three alone; when my lord and master returns one day, he sleeps soundly until dawn!" Comrade Gan Niu only criticizes the incorrect thinking in "Songs of Self-Pity," and points out that whether it is the train attendants or the buyers who are often away, their labor is indispensable and glorious. Although this statement is correct, it does not solve the actual problem. Even if the "Song of Self-Pity" is changed to "Song of Self-Joy," it still cannot solve ideological problems. In my opinion, this song of self-pity by the train attendants profoundly and painfully expresses their distress and demands. Because the service hours of train attendants were arranged very unreasonably in the past. Once they get on the train, they can only rest at the terminal station, sometimes doing through shifts for two or three days, which makes them exhausted. "When my lord and master returns one day," he even "sleeps soundly until dawn!" In addition to sympathizing with them and praising their enduring work ethic, we should also dig deeper and see that there is a very serious problem here. This "Song of Self-Pity" is giving us an alarm, asking the leadership to consider changing the working hours of train attendants and care about their vital interests. Only by treating "gripes" or ballad-style "gripes" in this way can we absorb useful things from them, and can we turn negative factors into positive factors.

### 牢骚和“自叹歌”

    牢骚和“自叹歌”
    若望
    有一些做思想工作的人，他们很注意所属人员所发的种种“牢骚”，他们过去所以重视下面的“牢骚”，因为从这里面可以发现人们真正的思想。当汇集了诸如此类的牢骚以后，便采取三种不同的处理方法：一种是个别谈话，批评一顿，说是不该这样自由主义或小广播；第二种是记入账本，等待年终鉴定或开生活检讨会时，来一个总算账，大意不外是说他会发牢骚，组织观念不强，严重一点的则批评为散布不满情绪，损害领导威信等等；第三种就是大会点名，在群众会议上说某某人说了一句什么不妥当的话，作为某种不正确的思想的典型，批驳得体无完肤。被点着名的人，没有一点申辩的机会，从此以后，也就很难抬起头来。
    被叫去个别谈话的，或是在大会上被点着名的人，他们在纳闷和懊悔之余，就免不了产生这样的问题：我就是私下里随便说说，是什么人打我的小报告的呢？结果，就联想到党员和团员的身上来了。这样，就使得这些人远离我们的党和青年团，对党员和团员产生了某种戒心。当然，我在这里也无妨批评这种联想实在是捕风捉影的猜疑，而好猜疑之特性，据说是以小资产阶级为甚的。
    这样批评自然是容易的。可是它不但不能解决思想问题，却只会加深这种隔阂。其根源却由于这些从事思想工作的同志，自己的思想就有问题。首先他们是主观主义的，对“发牢骚”缺乏辩证法的研究和考察，把“牢骚”一律看做是大逆不道；他们是宗派主义的，因为他们只相信某些党员或积极分子的汇报，把好发牢骚者引向与党、与青年团对立的地位；他们又是官僚主义的，因为他们不让下面讲不满的话，不喜欢听带有讽喻性的批评。
    须知：牢骚者，即不平之鸣也，“不平”者，即矛盾之所在也；而在缺乏民主的气氛下，言路阻塞，下情不能上达，乃化为三五知己之间的“牢骚”。固然，牢骚里面一定有许多不健康的消极因素，如道听途说，添枝加叶，个人成见，各走极端等等；问题不应该光看到这一面，还应该看到牢骚里面也有许多值得注意的东西，如直率的暴露思想；尖锐的自下而上的揭露，可以听到各种反面意见；对我们的工作中的错误和缺点发出警报，这一类意见往往在正式的会议上是听不到的。长久以来，我们光看到“牢骚”的消极的一面，看不到“牢骚”中也包含着另一种东西。更不善于化消极的东西为积极的东西。于是把下面的“牢骚”视为“自由主义”或“散布不满”，采取手段压之，禁之，把发牢骚的人列入“落后分子”队伍中，无非是想一手堵住人们的嘴，结果是原来的矛盾没有解决，反而增加了新的矛盾。古人有言：防民之口，甚于防川，牢骚是堵不住的。
    我倒并不是提倡大家来发牢骚。但我认为：牢骚也是一种民主不足的补助手段。凡牢骚多的地方，那里的民主生活一定不正常，那里的领导者总不大喜欢听取群众的意见。所以，如果要人家不发或少发牢骚，正当的办法就是多多的发扬民主，真正尊重下面的反面意见；其次，应该分析“牢骚”中包含着带有批评的部分，要学会利用各种反面意见检查我们的工作，从积极方面求得改进，也就是取其精华，剔其糟粕，对“牢骚”中的不健康因素，如夸大事实，个人成见，过高要求等等加以解释和说服，而这种解释和说服切忌在大会上指名，应该不牵涉到具体的人，在适当的场合采取诚恳的友好的态度附带说明一下就行了。有时候，不作解释和批评也没有关系，我们应该有“宰相肚里好撑船”的胸襟，用不着为两三句下面的流言而耿耿于怀。
    近读解放日报上登载甘牛的一篇“试改‘自叹歌’”，里面引录了几首有趣的现代民歌，我看这几首民歌，其实也是“牢骚”之类，不过它采取了艺术的形象化手段罢了。比如其中有一首：“好女不嫁乘车郎，三朝两夜守空房；有朝一日郎君归，呼呼一觉到天亮！”甘牛同志只是针对“自叹歌”里不正确的思想，加以批判，并指明：不论火车上的乘务员或经常在外的采购员，他们的劳动都是不可少的，都是光荣的，这种讲法虽然正确，但并不能解决实际问题，即使把“自叹歌”改成“自乐歌”，同样不能解决思想问题。依我看来，像乘务员的这首自叹歌，非常深刻而沉痛地抒发了他们的苦闷和要求。因为列车上的乘务员的服务时间，过去安排得很不合理，他们一上了车，直到终点站才能休息，有时候连做两天或三天的通班，弄得精疲力尽，“有朝一日郎君归，”竟至于“呼呼一觉到天亮！”我们除掉同情他们，赞扬他们的耐久的劳动精神以外，还应该挖得更深一些，看出这里面存在着一个很严重的问题，这首“自叹歌”正是给我们发出了警报，要求领导上来考虑改变乘务员的工作时间问题，关切他们的切身利益。只有这样来对待“牢骚”或歌谣体的“牢骚”，才能从这中间吸收到有益的东西，才能够化消极因素为积极因素。
