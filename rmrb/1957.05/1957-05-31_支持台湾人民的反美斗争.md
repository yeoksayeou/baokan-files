    Support the Anti-American Struggle of the Taiwanese People
    Li Chunqing
    The Taiwanese people's anti-American struggle has finally taken to the streets.

    May 24th marks another outbreak of the Taiwanese people's struggle against foreign aggressors. On this day, Taipei citizens smashed the American Embassy, tore up the American Stars and Stripes flag, and trampled it underfoot. This wasn't just about overturning the American court's verdict on Reynolds; it was an irrepressible eruption of the long-suppressed anger of the Taiwanese people, even under the strong control of the US-Chiang regime. This is another bloody declaration by the Taiwanese people: America is not allowed to occupy Taiwan.

    The American court declared the blood-soaked murderer Reynolds innocent and escorted him back to his country as a triumphant general. Reynolds escaped. But America's prestige in Taiwan died, and all the illegal laws and unreasonable justifications for America's occupation of Taiwan died with it. May 24th tells us that the US Seventh Fleet can enter the Taiwan Strait, but it cannot enter the hearts of the Taiwanese people; American missile forces can shoot down a military target, but they can never shoot down the dignity of the Chinese nation.

    Liu Ziran was from Wuxi, Jiangsu. He wasn't born in Taiwan, but he was Chinese. Because he was a Chinese person in Taiwan, America could kill him with impunity. This wasn't just the murder of Liu Ziran alone; it was America assassinating the Chinese people's right to exist and defend themselves. Liu Ziran could be killed, and the lives of all Chinese people in Taiwan, whether Taiwanese or those who went from the mainland, are not guaranteed. In fact, it is commonplace for Americans to kill, assault, rape, and humiliate people in Taiwan. The Taiwanese people's deep hatred of America finally erupted over the Liu Ziran case. Taiwanese compatriots and some mainland compatriots living in Taiwan stormed the American Embassy together, shouting for Americans to get out of Taiwan. They wanted to avenge Liu Ziran and were even willing to die for Liu Ziran's death. At this moment, the Chinese nation's heroic spirit of sacrificing one's life for righteousness was displayed, and the great unity of the Chinese people was demonstrated. In the anti-American demonstration, besides Taiwanese compatriots, there were also overseas Chinese students and Liu Ziran's wife. Outside the demonstrators in Taipei, students in various places gathered, and even some members of the Kuomintang's "Legislative Yuan" and "Control Yuan" could speak out righteously. They all united under the banner of patriotism.

    Tell the American aggressors: when the Chinese nation is harmed, Chinese people and Chinese people will unite. Not only can Chinese people in Taiwan unite, but Chinese people in Taiwan will also unite with Chinese people on the mainland. You will never be able to separate one part of the Chinese people from another forever, and you will never be able to create "two Chinas"!

    Tell the American aggressors: Taiwanese are all Chinese. The blood of the Chinese nation flows in their veins. They have a glorious revolutionary tradition and long experience in patriotic struggle. Today, they are fighting for patriotism and anti-Americanism, which is also a struggle to return to the embrace of the motherland. You will never be able to split China's territory, and you will never be able to create an "independent Taiwan"!

    At this important moment, I want to say a few words to the Chiang Kai-shek clique. You have betrayed the motherland, making the residents of Taiwan stateless people. Because they are stateless, they cannot protect Liu Ziran's life. Although you did not kill Liu Ziran, Liu Ziran actually died because of you. You imprison nine million Chinese people on the island of Taiwan, making nine million Chinese people stateless and homeless. Now you are arresting patriots and using bayonets to prohibit patriotic actions in Taiwan. You should not forget the Shen Chong case, nor should you forget the Chinese students' past anti-tyranny movements; you should remember the "February 28th" uprising and remember the swords, guns, and taste of that uprising. This anti-American struggle in Taipei is actually more profound and widespread than the "February 28th" uprising. If you do not release the patriots, do not lift the curfew, and do not allow the Taiwanese people to have the freedom to be patriotic, the anger will inevitably spread to you. You are so servile to the United States, but you should also be aware that the United States has not given you credit, and the pressure on you has only increased. You are just a pawn in America's overall game. As the world situation changes, the market price of this pawn will vary sooner or later. You have already been greatly devalued, and even your existence is in question. America's two prepared alternates—Liao Wenyi and so-called "free elements"—are waiting for you to be kicked off the stage at any time. There is an old Chinese saying: "When the cunning rabbit dies, the hunting dog is cooked." Hunting dogs that are useless or unsuitable will also be killed. The time has come for Chiang Kai-shek to stop betraying the country and seek a way out for himself.

    At this important moment, I also want to say a few words to the world. First of all, we thank the public opinion of various countries for their sympathy and support for the anti-American struggle of the Taiwanese people. We understand that this sympathy and support includes the protection of human justice, humanity, and the concept of legal equality, and some also include the feelings of shared suffering among the oppressed and humiliated. In countries where US troops are stationed, cases similar to Liu Ziran's, or even more tragic cases, occur everywhere. Wherever US troops go, national sovereignty and basic human rights are completely lost, and residents are constantly subjected to the disasters of national destruction and family annihilation. We appeal to all those who have suffered national destruction and family annihilation, and all those who have patriotism and a sense of justice: Unite! Please let the American troops go home!

    Although the anti-American struggle of the Taiwanese people has been temporarily suppressed, it is conceivable that the people's hearts are agitated and the undercurrents are surging because the problem has not been resolved. Regarding the Liu Ziran case, the United States has refused to retry Reynolds. Even if there is a retrial, there can be no justice. The Chiang Kai-shek clique has arrested a large number of patriots, and the Taiwanese people do not have the freedom to be patriotic. Many people sacrifice their lives, go to jail, and are monitored for being patriotic. But in the mainland of the motherland, not a single criminal American can enjoy privileges and get away with impunity. In the mainland of the motherland, the people have complete freedom to be patriotic. Taiwanese compatriots, Taiwanese patriots, you have a motherland. To prevent the occurrence of a second, third, or even endless Liu Ziran case, there is only one way: all patriotic forces must unite! Drive the American aggressors out of Taiwan! Strive for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan! Strive for Taiwan's return to the motherland! Fight on! Taiwanese compatriots, your struggle is not isolated. The motherland supports you, justice is on our side, the sympathy of the world's people is on our side, and final victory will belong to us.

    The anti-American struggle of the Taiwanese people will never cease until the American aggressors get out of Taiwan.

    支持台湾人民的反美斗争
    李纯青
    台湾人民反美斗争到底走上街头来了。
    5月24日是台湾人民又一次爆发的反抗外来侵略者的斗争。在这个日子里，台北市民捣毁了美国大使馆，把美国星条国旗撕碎，并且践踏在脚下。这不仅是推翻美国法庭对雷诺的判决而已，这是台湾人民积压已久的满腔愤怒，即使在美蒋强力控制下，也不可抑止地爆发了出来。这是台湾人民再一次用血写出的宣判：不许美国霸占台湾。
    美国法庭对满身血污的杀人凶手雷诺宣告无罪，并且把他当做凯旋将军护送回国，雷诺逃生了。但是美国在台湾的威风死亡了，美国霸占台湾的所有非法的法律和无理的理由通通死亡了。5月24日告诉我们，美国第七舰队可以开进台湾海峡，但它不能开进台湾的人心；美国导弹部队可以射击一个军事目标，但它永远不能射倒中国民族的尊严。
    刘自然是江苏无锡人，他并不是在台湾生长的，但是，他是中国人，因为他是在台湾的中国人，美国就可以对他格杀勿论。这不是刘自然一人的被杀，而是美国在刺杀着中国人的生存和自卫权利。刘自然可以被杀死，所有在台湾的中国人，不分台湾人或大陆去的人，生命都没有保障。事实上，美国人在台湾杀人行凶、强奸侮辱，是司空见惯的事。台湾人民对美国仇恨已深，终于在刘自然案件上爆发了。台湾同胞和一部分居住在台湾的大陆同胞，一同冲进美国大使馆，高喊美国人滚出台湾；他们要为刘自然报仇，甚至不惜为刘自然的死而死。这个时候，中国的民族舍生取义的英雄气概表现出来了，中国人民大团结表现出来了。在反美示威的队伍中，除了台湾同胞以外，还有华侨学生，还有刘自然的妻子。在台北示威群众以外，各地学生纷纷集会，甚至国民党“立法院”和“监察院”的一部分委员也能仗义执言。他们都团结起来了，团结在爱国主义的旗帜之下。
    告诉美国侵略者：在中国民族受到损害的时候，中国人和中国人是会团结的，不但在台湾的中国人能够团结，在台湾的中国人也将同在大陆的中国人团结起来。你们休想把一部分中国人同另一部分中国人永远分开，休想制造“两个中国”！
    告诉美国侵略者：台湾人都是中国人，他们脉管里流的是中国民族的血液，他们有着光荣的革命传统，有过长期爱国斗争的经验，今天他们为爱国反美而斗争，也即为回到祖国的怀抱而斗争。你们休想分裂中国的领土，休想制造“台湾独立国”！
    在这重要的时刻，我要向蒋介石集团说几句话。你们背叛祖国，让台湾居民成为无国之民。因为无国，所以不能保护刘自然的生命，你们虽不杀刘自然，刘自然实由你们而死。你们把九百万中国人囚禁在台湾岛上，使九百万中国人无国无家。现在你们又逮捕了爱国者，用刺刀禁止台湾的爱国行动。你们应该不会忘记沈崇案件，不会忘记中国学生历次抗暴运动；你们应该记得“二二八”起义，记得那次起义的刀枪和滋味。这次台北反美斗争，实际比“二二八”起义更深刻、更广泛。如果你们不释放爱国者，不解除宵禁，不许台湾人民有爱国的自由，怒火不会不向你们身上延烧。你们对美国那样卑躬屈膝，也应该有自知之明：美国并没有给你们记功，对你们的压力还是有加无已。你们在美国全盘棋局中只是一枚小卒，随着世界局势的变化，这枚小卒的时价早晚不同。你们已经大大被贬值，连存在都发生问题了。美国准备的两个候补者——廖文毅和所谓“自由分子”，随时等待你们被撵下台。中国有句老话说：“狡兔死，走狗烹”。走狗不中用或者不合用，也是要被杀掉的。到时候了，蒋介石应该停止卖国自求生路了。
    在这重要的时刻，我还要向全世界说几句话。首先，我们感谢各国舆论对台湾人民反美斗争的同情和支持。我们了解：那些同情和支持，包含着对人类正义、人道、法律平等观念的保护，也有一部分包含着被压迫、被侮辱者同病相怜的感情。在有美军驻扎的国家，到处都发生类似刘自然的案件，或者比这案件更加悲惨的案件。美军所到之处，国家主权和基本人权沦丧净尽，居民时刻受到破国亡家的灾祸。我们向一切破国亡家的人，一切有爱国心和正义感的人呼吁：团结起来！请美国军队滚回家去！
    现在台湾人民的反美斗争虽然暂时被强压下来，但是可以想像，人心是激昂的，暗潮是澎湃的，因为问题并没有解决。关于刘自然案件，美国已经拒绝重审雷诺。即使重审了，也不可能有公道。蒋介石集团逮捕大批的爱国者，台湾人民没有爱国的自由，许多人为了爱国而牺牲生命，而坐牢，而受监视。但是在祖国的大陆上，没有一个犯罪的美国人可以享受特权和逍遥法外。在祖国的大陆上，人民完全有爱国的自由。台湾同胞们，台湾的爱国者们，你们是有祖国的，你们要杜绝发生第二个第三个以至无穷尽的刘自然案件，道路只有一条：一切爱国力量团结起来！把美国侵略势力赶出台湾去！争取和平解放台湾！争取台湾回归祖国！奋斗吧！台湾同胞们，你们的斗争不是孤立的，祖国支持你们，正义在我们一边，世界人民的同情在我们一边，最后胜利必将属于我们。
    美国侵略势力不滚出台湾，台湾人民反美斗争绝不会休止。
