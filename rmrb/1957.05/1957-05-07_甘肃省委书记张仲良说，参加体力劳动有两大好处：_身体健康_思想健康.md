Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 6th. In the afternoon of May 5th, Zhang Zhongliang, Secretary of the CPC Gansu Provincial Committee, led more than 50 cadres at the level of ministers and directors of the Provincial Committee, to labor together with hundreds of construction workers at the 1021 construction site.

When carrying earth with Liu Yannian, Wei Lihe, the director of the construction site, and Qian Yuyi, the Party branch secretary, Comrade Zhang Zhongliang cordially inquired about the workers' living conditions, what opinions and demands they had of the leadership, and whether they had discussed the instructions on running enterprises diligently and thriftily. He also asked the cadres at the construction site if they were paying attention to ideological work. He told Qian Yuyi, "You should also labor with the workers. This has two benefits: physical health and ideological health."

The participation of the Provincial Party Secretary and the leaders of various departments in physical labor made the workers feel even more the glory of labor. Miao Furong, who came from Shandong to support the construction of Gansu, said: "I have been working for seven years, and this is the first time I have seen leaders doing this kind of work. How can we not work hard?" Wei Lihe and Qian Yuyi stated: They will definitely go deep into the construction site and work with the workers, and integrate with the workers.

This is the first time that leading cadres of the CPC Gansu Provincial Committee have participated in physical labor. Soon, the Provincial Committee will discuss making it a regular system. This participation in physical labor is actually the beginning of the rectification campaign, and it is also another call to cadres throughout the province to participate in physical labor.

Xinhua News Agency reported on May 4th, when leading cadres of the Changchun Railway Sub-bureau were studying the instructions of the CPC Central Committee on the rectification movement, they decided that starting this week, they would spend half a day each week participating in physical labor.

Leading cadres of the Chongqing Iron and Steel Company's trade union also decided on May 4th: Each member will choose a group and spend one day or half a day each week working with the workers in this group, and also attend production meetings and group life with the workers.

    甘肃省委书记张仲良说，参加体力劳动有两大好处：
    身体健康　思想健康
    本报兰州6日电　5日下午，中共甘肃省委书记张仲良率领省委部长和处长级的五十多名干部，同一○二一工地的几百名建筑工人在一块儿劳动。
    张仲良同志同工地主任刘延年、魏利和，党支部书记钱玉义在抬土的时候，亲切地向他们询问工人们的生活情况，对领导有哪些意见和要求？有没有讨论关于勤俭办企业的指示。他还问工地的干部抓不抓思想工作？他告诉钱玉义说：“你们也应该同工人一起劳动，这有两个好处：身体健康，思想健康。”
    省委书记和各部领导同志参加体力劳动，使工人们更感到劳动的光荣。从山东前来支援甘肃建设的苗富荣说：“我做七年工了，头一回看到首长干这种活，咱们还能不卖劲？”魏利和、钱玉义表示：今后也一定深入工地同工人一起干活，同工人打成一片。
    这是中共甘肃省委领导干部第一次参加体力劳动。不久，省委将讨论把它作为一个经常的制度。这次参加体力劳动实际上是整风的开始，也是又一次向全省干部发出参加体力劳动的号召。
    据新华社讯　5月4日，长春铁路分局领导干部在学习中共中央关于整风运动的指示的时候，决定从本周起，每周用半天时间参加体力劳动。
    重庆钢铁公司工会领导干部也于5月4日决定：每一位委员选择一个小组，每周以一天或半天的时间同这个小组工人一起干活，并同工人一道开生产会议和过小组生活。
