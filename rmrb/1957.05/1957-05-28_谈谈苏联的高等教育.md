    Let's Talk About Soviet Higher Education
    Zeng Zhaolun
    In order to conduct an on-the-spot investigation of the advanced experience of Soviet higher education, especially in the aspect of administrative leadership, as a reference for further improving our country's higher education, a delegation to the Soviet Union on higher education, consisting of twenty-four people including college presidents, professors, associate professors, and cadres from the Ministry of Higher Education, visited the Soviet Union in November 1956. The visit lasted for more than two months, during which we visited ten cities, the Soviet Ministry of Higher Education, the Ukrainian Republic Ministry of Higher Education, seventy-five institutions of higher learning, seven secondary technical schools, thirty-eight scientific research institutes, and several factories, state farms, and collective farms. During the visit, we were warmly welcomed and kindly received by the Soviet comrades everywhere. This brotherly and extremely profound friendship left us with an unforgettable impression and provided us with a profound education in internationalism. Here, I will introduce some of my experiences from the visit regarding the advanced experience of Soviet higher education:

    (1) Continuously Paying Attention to Improving the Quality of Higher Education

    Soviet higher education experienced a period of rapid development during the First Five-Year Plan, from 1929 to 1932, due to the urgent need for cadres. From 1933 to the present, for more than twenty years, it has been developing steadily, improving quality, and implementing this policy in all aspects.

    First, it is necessary to correctly formulate plans for training cadres and avoid an excessively rapid increase in enrollment. In the decade or so after the Second World War, the average annual increase in enrollment in Soviet higher education institutions (excluding correspondence students) was only 5.5%, with only one year showing an increase of 17%. In particular, starting in 1955, the number of college graduates basically met the needs, so enrollment began to stabilize. The enrollment number in 1955 (excluding correspondence) only increased by 16% compared to 1932, while correspondence education continued to develop vigorously. Adjusting the ratio of training senior and intermediate specialists has shown results in the past two years, and efforts are continuing to improve it.

    Second, it is necessary to rationally arrange the establishment of higher education institutions and majors, avoid setting up too many single-discipline colleges with narrow professional scopes, and correct the phenomenon of excessive and overly detailed specialization. During the period of rapid development in the Soviet Union from 1929 to 1932, many single-discipline colleges with very narrow professional scopes were established. Starting in 1932, this practice began to be corrected, and a number of single-discipline colleges were gradually merged, so the total number of schools is still less than the figure for 1932. In order to further improve quality, the Soviet Ministry of Higher Education is considering a more rational arrangement of higher education institutions according to the newly divided economic regions. Therefore, some schools in the European part are being reduced in size and merged, while some schools in Central Asia and the eastern region are still being newly built and expanded. Generally, efforts are being made to gradually achieve local enrollment, local training, and local job assignment for majors. In terms of major settings, in the past, when higher education institutions were under the leadership of various business departments, the departments were determined with reference to job titles, so the total number of majors in various schools once increased to 1,200. This approach was soon proven to be inappropriate; therefore, it began to be merged after 1932, and by the 1955-1956 academic year, it had been reduced to 285. In the future, in order to strengthen basic theory, improve quality, and meet practical needs, the types of engineering majors may need to be reduced further. It can be seen from this that the breadth of majors is certainly related to the level of science and the social division of labor, but to a large extent, it is determined by the needs and conditions of national culture and economic construction.

    Third, gradually improve the teaching system and teaching methods. On the basis of critically adopting some teaching systems and teaching methods before the revolution, Soviet higher education has continuously improved them, and by 1936, it had roughly formed the current set of advanced teaching systems and teaching methods. In this process, the unified teaching plan approved by the Soviet government played a positive role in ensuring the specifications for training cadres and gradually forming a complete set of teaching systems and teaching methods. The current teaching plan in the Soviet Union also has certain shortcomings, mainly that there are too many courses, the foundation is not strong enough, there are too many classroom hours, the study burden is too heavy, and it is not conducive to the cultivation of independent work ability. In order to improve these shortcomings, in September 1956, the Soviet Ministry of Higher Education gave schools greater flexibility in its instructions, requiring schools to improve them in response to the above-mentioned shortcomings. The teaching workload system implemented since 1938 has also been changed, and the staffing of teachers has been changed to be calculated based on the ratio of teachers to students, and the allocation of teaching work is determined based on the specific situation. During our visit, the schools were brewing revisions to the teaching plan, but no mature experience has been seen. In addition, in talks with responsible comrades of the Ministry of Higher Education, we learned that the following issues are also under study: enrollment work will gradually transition to only enrolling graduates from ten-year schools with more than two years of work experience; consideration will be given to increasing the internship period for graduates by one and a half to two years before awarding titles; the number of majors (especially in engineering) will be reduced again; and the current experimental, exercise classes, examinations and other methods will also be improved. Judging from these signs, the teaching plan of Soviet higher education institutions may undergo a major change in the next few years.

    Fourth, ensure that higher education institutions obtain high-level teachers. Teachers in Soviet higher education institutions have a high social status. Since 1946, their wages have been higher than those of scientific personnel in general scientific research institutions and production departments. The specific job positions of college graduates are mainly determined by the teachers of their own schools. Therefore, higher education institutions can absorb high-level scientific workers to work in the schools through competitive selection and other methods. At present, the ratio of teachers to students in Soviet higher education institutions is on average one to eleven point one (the proportion of teachers is larger in schools with better research work), and the number of teachers is not large, but the quality is high. Taking engineering as an example, professors account for 5% of the total number of teachers, associate professors account for 29.7%, and teaching assistants account for 65.3%. Teaching assistants generally have two or three years of practical work experience, and many have associate doctorate degrees, which is roughly equivalent to the level of lecturers in our country. In addition, there are a large number of teaching assistants to cooperate with the work, so the strength of the teachers can be fully utilized.

    Sixth, strengthen the leadership of higher education institutions. After the establishment of the Soviet Ministry of Higher Education in 1946, the unified leadership of various types of schools was strengthened. Comprehensively, the opinions of all parties in the Soviet Union on the leadership relationship of higher education institutions mostly believe that the leadership of higher education institutions by business departments once benefited the establishment of schools and contact with practice in the early stage, but at present, because several necessary systems have been formed, the above-mentioned benefits are no longer significant; on the other hand, because the main strength of business departments is placed on production work, the teaching work of schools often does not receive the necessary supervision and assistance; scientific research work is often not valued and promoted because business departments have their own research institutes, resulting in the school's work not being better developed, and the scientific level and the quality of training cadres will also be affected. It is better to be under the unified leadership of the Ministry of Higher Education. However, a few college presidents also believe that if the business department can give strong support to the school in terms of funding and equipment, it would be better for the Ministry of Higher Education and the business department to have dual leadership.

    The academic leadership of Soviet higher education institutions is very strong. The academic conferences at the college, department, and department levels play a decisive role in academic issues. The teaching and research group is a strong grass-roots organization for the academic work of the school. Teaching and scientific research work are mostly arranged and decided by the teaching and research group, and the director of the teaching and research group generally has a very high prestige.

    Recently, the Central Committee of the CPSU and the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League have also given instructions on strengthening political and ideological work in higher education institutions, and a lot of work has been carried out.

    (2) Vigorously Carry Out Scientific Research Work

    Before 1930, Soviet higher education institutions had always been the main places for the country to train senior construction talents and conduct scientific research work, but around 1930, during the period of rapid development of higher education, the idea of dividing higher education and scientific research work once dominated. Some high-level experts left the schools one after another and established many scientific research institutions separately. For the past twenty years, people have been constantly arguing about this practice. At present, the vast majority of people in the higher education community admit that scientific research and training cadres are inseparable tasks of higher education institutions. In order to vigorously strengthen the scientific research work of higher education institutions, the Soviet government has taken several measures, the main ones being: (1) The state allocated 220 million rubles to establish 85 modern laboratories in higher education institutions, (2) Allowed business departments to transfer research institutes to higher education institutions, and allocated the latest equipment to the schools at no cost, (3) Changed the teaching workload system to enable schools to better deploy scientific research forces and better carry out scientific research work, (4) Further encourage scientists from scientific institutions to teach part-time in higher education institutions.

    At present, it is relatively common for Soviet higher education institutions to conduct scientific research work. Everyone recognizes that scientific research is the main way to improve teachers. Generally, more than 50% of teachers in engineering schools are actively engaged in scientific research work. In comprehensive universities, the proportion is much higher (many comprehensive universities basically have all teachers engaged in scientific research), but the development of scientific research in different schools and different teaching and research groups is also very uneven. A small part of the scientific research topics in engineering colleges are self-ordered and the Ministry of Higher Education allocates funds, and most of them are commissioned tasks accepted by signing contracts with the Academy of Sciences and business departments; comprehensive universities are mostly self-ordered by the schools, and the Ministry of Higher Education allocates funds. For example, taking the sixty engineering colleges managed by the Soviet Multidisciplinary Engineering College General Administration as an example, in 1956, the funding allocated by the Ministry was only 8 million rubles, while the funding obtained from contracted contracts was 100 million rubles. This approach is a very good way to connect with reality and save funds. The scientific research work of higher education institutions is mostly carried out collectively by one (or even several) teaching and research groups, with high and intermediate-level teachers cooperating to form a complete set, and the strength has been fully utilized. The equipment for scientific research is generally extremely economical, but the Ministry of Higher Education pays attention to ensuring the necessary conditions. In terms of manpower, there are full-time scientific researchers and assistants, and the number depends on the workload of scientific research. Teaching assistants generally account for about half of the number of teachers. In comprehensive university experimental science majors, this ratio is about one to one, or more. For all scientific research work carried out under contract, the salaries of assistants are paid from the contract.

    (3) Rapidly Developing Higher Education in Minority Areas

    The rapid development of higher education in minority areas is a vivid manifestation of the great success of the Soviet national policy. Taking the Uzbek Republic and the Kazakh Republic that we visited as examples, in the era of Tsarist Russia, there was not a single institution of higher learning in the vast area of ​​Central Asia; after the October Revolution, in 1920, the Central Asian University was established in Tashkent. By 1955-1956, the Uzbek Republic (with a population of only 7.3 million) already had 36 institutions of higher learning with more than 65,000 students, and the teaching and scientific research level of some of these schools was also quite high. Generally, ethnic minorities account for about 50% of the students, and ethnic minorities generally account for 30% to 35% of the teachers, among whom many have already obtained doctoral degrees and hold professorships.

    The experience of the Soviet Union in establishing higher education institutions in minority areas in these two republics has the following three points worthy of attention. First, after the revolution, higher education institutions were quickly established based on the existing conditions in the ethnic areas, and a group of Russian scholars were sent to teach. At first, they were willing to lower the requirements slightly, and then gradually increased them. Second, first seriously run a higher education institution (the professional settings can be multi-faceted) well in one area, and train a group of teachers locally, and then separate them to establish other schools. For example, when Central Asian University was established in 1920, it had departments in literature, science, agriculture, engineering, and medicine. It was not until 1928 that it began to separate some single-discipline colleges. Third, in terms of teaching language, fully respect the habits and wishes of the people of all ethnic groups. For example, in the two republics of Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, although young students understand Russian, in most institutions of higher learning, teaching is still conducted in ethnic languages ​​in the lower grades, and then Russian is used in the higher grades. At Kiev University in Ukraine, 70% to 75% of the courses are also taught in Ukrainian.

    (4) Practicing Diligence and Frugality in Running Schools

    The Soviet Union pays attention to equipping higher education institutions with the necessary manpower and material resources. In addition to teachers, housing, equipment, libraries, farms, and other conditions, many schools have production factories to produce and repair instruments and equipment. The nationally coordinated materials are supplied by the General Administration of Equipment Supply of the Ministry of Higher Education. In addition, in order to help solve the problem of scientific and technological information, the Ministry of Higher Education leads the Moscow Scientific and Technical Library, which has 3.5 million books, 3,000 kinds of periodicals, and thirteen branches throughout the country. Even so, the current manpower and material conditions of Soviet higher education institutions are not very rich, and some are even difficult. The teaching and scientific research work of higher education institutions is still being carried out by constantly overcoming difficulties and striving to create conditions. Practicing diligence and frugality in running schools has become a common practice in higher education institutions.

    Due to the surge in the number of students and the failure of infrastructure construction to keep up, teaching buildings are generally very crowded. Agricultural colleges generally have three to four square meters per student, and engineering colleges have four to six square meters (actual usable area). Classrooms and laboratories are used from morning to night, and the two-shift system is more common. Some even have three shifts a day in the morning, afternoon, and evening. Some particularly crowded schools even occupy corridors as laboratories, and some temporarily use auditoriums as graduation design classrooms. There are few outdoor sports fields on campus. Except for a very few schools with a basketball court, most of them are just a few ordinary houses of about 50 to 150 square meters. Generally, about half of the students cannot live on campus due to the lack of dormitories. Some schools have students who personally build part of the school buildings, which is a valuable experience. The number of sets of experimental equipment for students is not large, so most of them adopt a circulation system. Some of the equipment is relatively old, but the utilization rate is relatively high. The addition of school equipment does not solely rely on the allocation of funds from the Ministry of Higher Education. Many schools make their own instruments, and a large part of the engineering colleges relies on scientific research contracts signed with business departments to solve the problem. Many teachers and graduate students leave the equipment they have used for scientific research as experimental equipment for students, so the experiments that can be opened in the laboratory are sometimes several times more than the experiments done by students, and each school has its own characteristics. This approach has stimulated the enthusiasm of teachers for scientific research, saved funds, and improved teaching quality.

    The great Soviet people, especially the advanced experience of higher education created by Soviet higher education workers with tireless labor and hard work, is a brilliant example for us to learn from. Every comrade of the higher education delegation to the Soviet Union felt honored to be able to personally learn these valuable experiences. In the future, we must work together with all higher education workers to further seriously and humbly learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, creatively apply it in combination with China's reality, and strive to continuously improve our country's higher education.

    谈谈苏联的高等教育
    曾昭抡
    为了实地考察苏联高等教育的先进经验，特别是行政领导方面的经验，作为进一步改进我国高等教育的参考，由高等学校校院长、教授、副教授及高等教育部干部等二十四人组成的高等教育赴苏访问团于1956年11月赴苏访问。访问活动前后历时两个多月，先后到过十个城市，访问了苏联高等教育部、乌克兰共和国高等教育部、七十五所高等学校、七所中等技术学校、三十八所科学研究所和几所工厂、国营农场、集体农庄等。在访问过程中，我们到处都受到苏联同志们的热烈欢迎和亲切接待。这种兄弟般极其深厚的友情给我们留下了难忘的印象，使我们受到了深刻的国际主义教育。在这里我将访问后对苏联高等教育先进经验的一些体会介绍如下：
    （一）不断注意提高高等教育的质量
    苏联高等教育在第一个五年计划期间，由于迫切需要干部，在1929—1932年有过一度大发展。从1933年起到现在，二十多年来一直是稳步发展，提高质量，并且在各方面注意贯彻这一方针。
    首先是正确地制订培养干部计划，避免招生数增加过快。二次大战后，十多年来，苏联高等学校招生数（函授生除外）平均每年增加率不过5.5％，只有一年增加了17％。特别是1955年起，高等学校毕业生在数量上已基本满足需要，因此招生人数开始稳定，1955年招生数（不包括函授）只比1932年增加了16％，而函授教育则在继续大力发展中。调整培养高级和中级专门人才的比例，最近两年已著有成绩，现在仍在继续努力改进。
    其次是合理地安排高等学校和专业的设置，避免设立过多的专业范围太窄的单科性学院，纠正专业分得过多过细的现象。苏联在1929—1932年大发展时，一度成立了许多专业范围很窄的单科性学院。1932年起就开始纠正这种做法，陆续合并了一批单科性学院，所以现在学校总数还少于1932年的数字。为了进一步提高质量，苏联高等教育部正考虑按新划分的经济地区，更合理地安排高等学校，因此欧洲部分的学校有些正在缩小和合并，而中亚细亚和东方地区则还在新建和扩大一些学校，一般专业争取逐步做到基本上就地招生，就地培养，就地分配工作。在专业设置方面，过去在高等学校分归各业务部门领导时，系参照工作职务来定的，因而各类学校的专业总数一度增加到一千二百种。这种做法不久就证明是不够恰当的；所以在1932年以后便开始加以合并，到1955—1956学年已减至二百八十五种。今后为了加强基础理论，提高质量，为了适应实际需要，工科的专业种类可能还要减少。由此可见，专业的宽窄固然和科学水平以及社会分工有关，但在很大程度上是由国家文化、经济建设的需要和条件所决定的。
    第三是逐步改进教学制度和教学方式。苏联高等学校在批判地采用革命前一些教学制度和教学方式的基础上，加以不断改进，到1936年大体上已经形成了目前的一套先进的教学制度和教学方式。在这个过程中，苏联政府批准的统一教学计划对保证培养干部规格和逐渐形成一整套教学制度、教学方式是有积极作用的。苏联现行的教学计划也还存在某些缺点，主要是课程较多，基础还不够强，课堂学时过多，学习负担过重，不利于独立工作能力的培养。为了改进这些缺点，1956年9月苏联高等教育部在指示中给学校以较大的灵活权，要求学校针对上述缺点加以改进，从1938年起实行的教学工作量制度也改变了，教师编制改以师生比例来计算，分配教学工作则看具体情况而定。我们访问期间，各校正酝酿改订教学计划，但还未见到成熟的经验。另外与高等教育部负责同志的谈话中得悉下面几个问题也在研究之中：招生工作将逐步过渡到只招收有两年以上工龄的十年制学校毕业生，毕业生考虑增加一年半到两年的见习期后再授予称号，专业数（尤其是工科）将再作缩减，目前的实验、习题课、考试等方式也还要加以改进。从这一些迹象来看，苏联高等学校的教学计划有可能在今后几年中发生一次较大的变化。
    第四是保证高等学校获得水平高的教师。苏联高等学校教师有较高社会地位，1946年起工资高于一般科学研究机关和生产部门的科学人员。高等学校毕业生分配具体工作岗位时主要由本校教师决定。因此高等学校就可能通过竞选等办法吸收水平高的科学工作者到学校工作。目前苏联高等学校师生的比例平均是一比十一点一（研究工作开展得较好的学校中教师的比例较大），教师的数量不算多，但质量较高。以工科为例，在教师总数中教授占5％，副教授占29.7％，助教占65.3％，助教一般有两三年实际工作经验，不少是副博士，大体上相当于我国讲师的水平，另外还有大量教学辅助人员配合工作，因此教师力量得以充分发挥。
    第六是加强对高等学校的领导。1946年苏联高等教育部成立后，加强了对各类学校的统一领导。综合苏联各方面对高等学校领导关系的意见，大多认为业务部门领导高等学校在早期曾经有利于学校的建立和联系实际，但目前由于若干必要的制度已经形成，上述好处已经不显著；而在另一方面，由于业务部门领导的主要力量放在生产工作上，学校的教学工作往往得不到必要的监督和帮助；科学研究工作往往由于业务部门另有研究所而得不到重视和推动，以致造成学校工作不能更好发展，科学水平和培养干部的质量也会受到影响，不如统一归高等教育部领导为好。但也有少数校院长认为，如果业务部门能在经费和设备上给学校以大力支持，则由高等教育部与业务部门双重领导更好一些。
    苏联高等学校的学术领导是很强的，学院的院、系两级学术会议在学术问题上起决定性的作用。教研组是学校学术工作强有力的基层组织，教学工作、科学研究工作大多由教研组安排决定，教研组主任一般威信很高。
    最近苏共中央和共青团中央对加强高等学校的政治思想工作也都有所指示，进行了很多工作。
    （二）大力开展科学研究工作
    在1930年以前，苏联高等学校一直是国家培养高级建设人才和进行科学研究工作的主要场所，但在1930年左右高等教育大发展时期的前后，高等教育和科学研究工作分工进行的想法一度占有统治地位，部分水平高的专家陆续离开了学校，单独成立了许多科学研究机关。二十年来人们对这种做法不断争论，到目前绝大多数高等教育界人士承认科学研究和培养干部是高等学校不可分离的任务。为了大力加强高等学校的科学研究工作，苏联政府已采取了若干措施，其中主要的是：（1）国家拨款二亿二千万卢布在高等学校中建立八十五个近代化的试验室，（2）允许业务部门将研究所移交给高等学校，并且无价拨给学校以最新设备，（3）改变教学工作量制度，使学校更好地调配科学研究力量，更好地开展科学研究工作，（4）进一步鼓励科学机关的科学家到高等学校兼课。
    目前苏联高等学校进行科学研究工作是比较普遍的。大家都认识到科学研究是提高教师的主要道路，工科学校一般已有50％以上的教师积极地从事科学研究工作，在综合大学里，比例还要高得多（有不少综合大学基本上全体教师都从事科学研究），但不同学校、不同教研组开展科学研究的情况也很不平衡。科学研究的题目在工学院中一小部分是自订后由高教部拨给经费，大部分是与科学院、业务部门订立合同接受的委托任务；综合大学则多半是学校自订，由高教部拨给经费。如以苏联多科性工学院总管理司所管的六十所工学院来说，1956年部拨经费只有八百万卢布而订合同所得经费达一亿卢布。这种做法对联系实际和节省资金都是很好的办法。高等学校的科学研究工作大多是以一个（甚至几个）教研组为集体来进行的，高、中级教师配合成套，力量得到了充分的发挥。科学研究的设备总的看来极为节约，但高教部对必要的条件是注意保证的。人力方面有专职的科学研究人员及辅助人员，数量视科学研究的工作量而定。教学辅助人员一般约达到教师人数的一半，在综合大学实验科学方面的专业，这个比例约为一比一，或更多。凡根据合同进行的科学研究工作，辅助人员的工资由合同中支付。
    （三）迅速发展少数民族地区的高等教育
    少数民族地区高等教育事业的迅速发展是苏联民族政策伟大成功的生动表现。就我们访问的乌兹别克共和国和哈萨克共和国为例，帝俄时代整个中亚细亚广大地区没有一所高等学校；十月革命以后，1920年就在塔什干建立了中亚细亚大学，到1955—1956年，乌兹别克共和国（人口只有七百三十万人）已经有了三十六所高等学校，学生六万五千多人，其中有些学校的教学及科学研究水平也相当高。学生中少数民族一般占50％左右，教师中少数民族一般占到30％到35％，其中有不少人已经得到博士学位，担任教授职务。
    苏联这两个共和国少数民族地区建立高等学校的经验，有下列三点值得注意。第一，革命以后，根据民族地区已有的条件很快建立了高等学校，派遣一批俄罗斯学者去担任教学，最初宁愿把要求稍微放低一些，然后逐步提高。第二，首先在一个地区认真地把一个高等学校（其专业设置可以是多方面的）办好，就地培养出一批教师，然后再分出去成立其他学校。如中亚细亚大学在1920年成立时有文、理、农、工、医等各方面的系科，一直到1928年才开始分出一些单科性学院。第三，教学用语方面，充分尊重各民族人民的习惯与愿望。例如在乌兹别克和哈萨克两个共和国，虽然青年学生都懂俄文，但在大多数高等学校里，在低年级还是用民族语言进行教学，在高年级时乃改用俄文教学。在乌克兰的基辅大学，也有70％到75％的课程用乌克兰语讲授。
    （四）厉行勤俭办学
    苏联对高等学校必要的人力物力，是注意配备的。除了教师、房舍、设备、图书馆、农场等条件外，不少学校有生产工厂进行仪器设备的生产和修配工作。全国统调物资由高等教育部设备供应总管理司供应。另外为了帮助解决科学技术资料问题，高等教育部领导有莫斯科科学技术图书馆，藏书三百五十万册，期刊三千种，并且在全国设有十三个分馆。虽然如此，目前苏联高等学校的人力物力条件也还不是很富裕的，有些甚至是困难的。高等学校的教学和科学研究工作还是在不断克服困难，争取创造条件中进行。勤俭办学在高等学校中已成为一种风气。
    教学用房由于学生激增，基建跟不上，因之一般很挤。农学院一般是每一学生三到四平方公尺，工科四到六平方公尺（实际使用面积）。教室、实验室从早用到晚，二部制是较普遍的，有的甚至每天上午、下午、晚上三班倒。某些特别挤的学校甚至占用走廊作实验室，有的临时利用礼堂作为毕业设计教室。校内运动场地室外的很少，室内的除极少数学校有一个篮球场外，大多数仅仅是几间五十到一百五十平方公尺左右的普通房子而已。学生一般有半数左右因无宿舍不能住校。有的学校，一部分校舍是学生亲自动手盖起来的，这是可宝贵的经验。学生的实验设备套数不多，因之大多采取循环制，设备有些还是比较陈旧的，但使用率都比较高。学校设备的添置不单纯依靠高教部拨款购置，很多学校自己动手做仪器，工学院中很大一部分靠与业务部门订的科学研究合同解决。许多教师、研究生进行科学研究时用过的设备就留下来作为学生的实验设备，因此实验室所能开的实验，有时几倍于学生所做的实验，而且各校有其特点。这种做法激发了教师进行科学研究的积极性，节省了资金，也提高了教学质量。
    伟大的苏联人民，特别是苏联高等教育工作者以无限辛勤的劳动艰苦创造的高等教育先进经验，是我们学习的光辉榜样。高等教育赴苏访问团的每一个同志都以能亲身学习到这些宝贵的经验而感到荣幸。今后我们一定要和全体高等教育工作者一起，进一步认真地、虚心地学习苏联的先进经验，结合中国实际创造性地加以运用，为不断改进我国高等教育而努力。
