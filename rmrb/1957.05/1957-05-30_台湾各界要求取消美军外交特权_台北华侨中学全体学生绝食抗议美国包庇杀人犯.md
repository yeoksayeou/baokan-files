Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, May 29th – Following the release of murderer Reynolds by American aggressors in Taiwan who abused extraterritorial rights, Taiwanese newspapers and people from all walks of life have demanded the cancellation of diplomatic privileges enjoyed by the US military stationed in Taiwan.

In two editorials published by Taipei's "United Daily News" on the Reynolds case, it repeatedly proposed a speedy resolution to the legal jurisdiction issue of the US military stationed in Taiwan. The editorial said: "The reason Reynolds was declared innocent is because he enjoyed diplomatic privileges as an American sergeant." The editorial believes that if the jurisdiction issue of the US military stationed in Taiwan is not resolved, not only will Liu Ziran-like cases occur at any time, but it will also have a "significant impact on the integrity of our law and sovereignty!"

Taiwan's "New Life Daily" and "Credit News," as well as many newspapers across Taiwan, in editorials published in recent days, also demanded the revocation of the "diplomatic immunity" of the US military stationed in Taiwan. The editorial in "Credit News" pointed out that to eliminate the root cause of events like the Reynolds murder case, it is necessary to "cancel the privilege enjoyed by the US military of not being subject to local legal jurisdiction!"

People from all walks of life in Taiwan expressed their opinions on the issue of privileges enjoyed by the US military stationed in Taiwan by publishing articles in newspapers or writing letters to newspapers. An article published in the "United Daily News" said that US military personnel stationed in Taiwan "every private enjoys extra diplomatic privileges here, Taiwan is truly a paradise for the overseas garrisons of the United States." The "United Daily News" and "New Life Daily" have received hundreds of letters from readers. According to these two newspapers, in addition to expressing indignation at Reynolds being found not guilty, these letters universally demanded the swift cancellation of the diplomatic privileges enjoyed by the US military stationed in Taiwan.

Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, May 29th – According to Taiwan and Hong Kong newspaper reports: Starting from the 25th, the Chiang army's Taipei Garrison Command issued three prohibitions: first, the implementation of martial law and curfew; second, the prohibition of all gatherings, marches, petitions, and other activities; and third, the "Ten Killings Order," which stipulates that anyone who commits any of the ten so-called "crimes" such as "spreading rumors to confuse the public" will be "sentenced to death according to law." Taiwan has become an even more terrifying world.

Newspaper reports said that many Kuomintang military and political officials in Taiwan were deeply dissatisfied with the US "Ambassador" to Taiwan, Rankin, for forcing Chiang Kai-shek to replace Huang Chen-wu and two other Chiang army generals. Huang Jie, Commander-in-Chief of the Chiang Army, felt apprehensive and uneasy about being assigned to concurrently serve as Commander of the Taipei Garrison, reluctantly taking office on the 27th. Le Gan, Director of the Taiwan Provincial Police Department of the Kuomintang, has been dismissed, and yesterday it was announced that Guo Yong, Commander of the Eighth Army of the Chiang Army, would be transferred to the position of Director of the Police Department.

The headquarters of the US Military Assistance Advisory Group in Taiwan remains heavily guarded, with doors closed tightly, only opening when someone enters or exits. The long lines of "Bing" (military) license-plated US military vehicles that used to be parked in front of the headquarters are now rarely seen; some have been driven into garages, and some have been burned and smashed by protesting crowds. Ganzhou Street, near the headquarters of the US Military Advisory Group, has become one of the most deserted areas in the city. This is a street that Taipei citizens call a "terror zone," where US military personnel used to congregate, often harassing women and engaging in drunken brawls.

Newspaper commentaries from various counties and cities in Taiwan on the 25th also demanded that Chiang Kai-shek cancel the "diplomatic immunity" of the US military stationed in Taiwan, and published many letters and articles from readers protesting to the US authorities. On the 26th, anti-American slogans and leaflets were still found from time to time in many counties and cities in Taiwan. The slogan "Yankees Go Home" has become a common cry of the Taiwanese people today.

Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, May 29th – Taiwan newspaper reports stated that after the US military released murderer Reynolds and anti-American demonstrations were held in Taipei, the Speaker of the Taichung "City Council" demanded that the Taiwan authorities promptly negotiate with the United States to re-examine the Liu Ziran murder case, and also demanded that in the future, "unofficial diplomatic personnel" in Taiwan should not enjoy diplomatic privileges. Anyone who violates the law should be tried in accordance with local laws.

Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, May 29th – Taiwan newspaper reports: The city of Taichung, with a population of 250,000, has been filled with an atmosphere of grief and indignation for the past few days. People are discussing the Liu Ziran case, and in extreme indignation, they said: "We demand the unification of our own legal rights. The authorities should promptly revoke the extraterritorial rights enjoyed by the US military, so as to avoid another Liu Ziran tragedy."

Newspaper reports said that students at the Taichung Provincial Agricultural College have protested to the United States regarding the Reynolds case and also demanded that the Taiwan authorities "take prompt measures to cancel the diplomatic privileges of the US military in Taiwan."

Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, May 29th – Taiwan newspaper reports that all students at the Overseas Chinese High School in Taipei County went on a hunger strike on the 25th to protest the US verdict of "not guilty" for Reynolds, and protested the Chiang Kai-shek group's military police for injuring and arresting Overseas Chinese students who participated in anti-American demonstrations on the 24th.

On the same day, all students of the Overseas Chinese High School also held a meeting and unanimously passed two resolutions: 1. Demand that the Taiwan authorities revoke the US military court's verdict and return the murderer Reynolds to Taiwan for retrial and conviction by the Taiwanese judicial authorities; 2. Demand that the Taiwan authorities immediately cancel the diplomatic privileges enjoyed by the US military in Taiwan.

    台湾各界要求取消美军外交特权
    台北华侨中学全体学生绝食抗议美国包庇杀人犯
    新华社广州29日电　美国侵略者在台湾滥用治外法权释放杀人凶犯雷诺后，台湾报纸和社会各界人士纷纷要求取消驻台美军享有外交人员待遇的特权。
    台北“联合报”就雷诺事件发表的两篇社论中，一再提出要迅速解决驻台美军法律管辖权问题。社论说：“雷诺之得以宣告无罪，就是因他以一个美国军士而享有外交人员特权”。社论认为要是不解决驻台美军管辖权问题，不但随时会有刘自然一类案件发生，而且对于“我法律与主权的完整性，也有莫大的影响！”
    台湾“新生报”和“征信新闻”以及台湾各地许多报纸，在连日来发表的社论中，也要求撤销驻台美军的“外交豁免权”。“征信新闻”的社论指出，要消除造成雷诺杀人无罪这类事件的根源，那就要“取消美军所享不受当地法权管辖的特权！”
    台湾社会各界人士在报纸上发表文章或写信给报纸，就驻台美军所享的特权问题发表意见。刊登在“联合报”上的一篇文章说，驻台美军“每一个小兵在此间都额外的享有外交特权，台湾才真是美国海外驻军的乐园。”“联合报”和“新生报”都收到了数以百计的读者来信，据这两家报纸说，这些信件除了对雷诺被判无罪表示愤慨外，普遍都要求迅速取消驻台美军所享受的外交人员待遇的特权。
    新华社香港29日电　据台湾、香港报纸消息：从25日起，蒋军台北卫戍司令部发布了三项禁令，第一是实行戒严和宵禁；第二是禁止一切集会、游行、请愿等活动；第三是“十杀令”，凡是犯了所谓“造谣惑众”等十项“罪名”的，都要“依法判处死刑”。台湾更加成了一个恐怖世界。
    报纸消息说，台湾许多国民党军政官员对于美国驻台“大使”兰金迫使蒋介石撤换黄珍吾等三名蒋军将领，深感不满。蒋军陆军总司令黄杰对被派兼任台北卫戍司令，感到惶恐和不安，27日勉强上任。国民党台湾省警务处长乐干已被撤职，昨天发表由蒋军第八军军长郭永转任警务处长。
    美国驻台湾军事援助顾问团总部仍然重门关闭，戒备森严，只在有人进出时才开门。平日在门前摆成长龙的“宾”字号美军汽车，现在已不易看见，有些驶入了车库，有些被示威群众烧毁打烂了。美军顾问团总部附近的甘州街成为全市最冷落的地段之一。这是一条被台北市民称为“恐怖区域”的街道，平日美军云集，经常在那里调戏妇女，酗酒闹事。
    台湾各县、市的报纸25日的评论还要求蒋介石取消驻台美军的“外交豁免权”，并且刊登了许多读者向美国当局抗议的信件和文章。26日，台湾许多县市仍不时发现反美标语和传单。“美军滚出去”的口号，已经成为今日台湾人民的普遍呼声。
    新华社香港29日电　台湾报纸消息，台中“市议会”议长在美军释放杀人犯雷诺和台北举行反美大示威后，要求台湾当局迅速向美国交涉重新审判刘自然被杀案，并且要求今后对在台湾的“非正式外交人员”，不得享受外交人员的特权。凡犯法者，应依本地法律予以审判。
    新华社香港29日电　台湾报纸报道：二十五万市民的台中市，几天来充满了悲愤和不平的空气，人们都以刘自然案件为谈话资料，他们在极度的愤慨中表示：“我们要求自己法权的统一，对美军享受的治外法权，当局应予以迅速的撤销，以免造成下一次刘自然惨案。”
    报纸消息说，台中省立农学院学生已经就雷诺事件向美国提出抗议，同时要求台湾当局“迅速采取措施，取消美军在台湾的外交特权。”
    新华社香港29日电　台湾报纸报道，台北县的华侨中学全体学生，25日绝食抗议美国判决雷诺“无罪”，并且抗议蒋介石集团军警24日击伤和逮捕参加反美示威的华侨学生。
    同一天华侨中学全体学生还举行集会，一致通过两项决定：一、要求台湾当局取消美军军事法庭的判决，杀人凶犯雷诺解回台湾由台湾司法机关重新审判定罪；二、要求台湾当局立即取消在台美军享有外交特权的待遇。
