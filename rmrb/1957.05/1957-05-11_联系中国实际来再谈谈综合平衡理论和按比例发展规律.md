    Re-Examining Comprehensive Balance Theory and the Law of Proportional Development in Light of China's Actual Situation
                          Ma Yinchu
    In the conclusion of my previous article (published in the People's Daily on December 28th and 29th, 1956), I mentioned that due to space limitations, I only discussed a few links and not all aspects within each link. For example, industry is a link, and all aspects within this link should also be discussed to achieve a comprehensive balance theory. In addition to the balance between heavy and light industries, there is also the balance between existing and newly built industries, coastal and inland industries, raw material and processing industries, central and local industries, large and small-scale industries, etc. Due to space limitations, I did not discuss them in detail and planned to write another article for detailed discussion. Now, to complete the task, I will still use the roundabout method to write the following article:
    (I) Balance between Heavy and Light Industries
    I have already discussed the balance between heavy and light industries in my previous article. Here, I will only bring up one point that was not discussed in the previous article but is closely related to this one. With the expansion of industrial production and capital construction, the annual demand for steel in terms of quantity and variety is huge. It is necessary to ensure that this demand is met in order for China's industry to develop smoothly. Can we rely on importing steel from abroad to develop our industry? Obviously, this path is not feasible. Because relying mainly on foreign steel imports will not only fail to build an independent and strong industry, but also the large-scale import of steel is impossible. This can be proven by the following facts: In 1955, the United States produced over 106 million tons of steel, of which 95% was consumed domestically, and only 5% was exported (excluding the export of machinery); Britain produced 20 million tons of steel, of which only about 10% was exported, mainly to British territories, countries under British capital control, and oil-producing countries enjoying preferential treatment from Britain; West Germany also exported a small amount of steel. Looking at the socialist camp, in 1955, socialist countries produced a total of over 60 million tons of steel, of which the Soviet Union produced 45 million tons. However, both the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries felt that steel was in short supply. Therefore, it is difficult to rely on large-scale imports of steel to solve China's industrialization needs. Democratic countries and the Soviet Union, although willing to provide fraternal and friendly assistance, are busy building their socialist and communist societies. Increasing their steel exports would delay their socialist construction progress, which would not be beneficial to strengthening the overall socialist democratic camp. This method should only be used when necessary and limited to a small amount of high-quality and special steel. China is a member of the socialist family. In order to make the entire socialist camp more prosperous and to give the socialist camp more metal, we must resolutely implement the central government's policy of vigorously developing the steel industry and rapidly improve the production level of China's steel industry. During the First Five-Year Plan, we adopted the policy of "concentrating greater financial and human resources to build the steel industry in order to establish the foundation of China's industrialization in a shorter period of time." In the Second Five-Year Plan, we will continue to adopt the policy of vigorously developing the steel industry. On the basis of the steel industry, we must quickly establish our own necessary machine manufacturing industry, metallurgical industry, and other related heavy industries. Otherwise, what will we use to equip light industry, transportation, construction, and agriculture? We will not get the necessary machines, steel, cement, electricity, and fuel, and our national economy will be in a backward state for a long time. Obviously, we must never do that. Therefore, the policy of socialist industrial construction centered on heavy industry is correct. Therefore, the scale of capital construction this year (1957) is still very large. Capital construction investment will account for more than one-third of the country's fiscal revenue this year. Hundreds of major projects above the quota, such as the three steel industry bases in Wuhan, Baotou, and Anshan, the Jilin Chemical Fertilizer Plant, the Fushun East Open-pit Coal Mine, the Lanzhou Oil Refinery, and the heavy machinery plants in Fularji and Taiyuan, will continue to be constructed. If this plan is completed, the capital construction tasks in the First Five-Year Plan will be overfulfilled.
    However, we cannot one-sidedly emphasize the development of heavy industry and reduce the importance of the development of light industry and other economic sectors. We should understand that since the people's need for consumer goods is increasing day by day, if we do not develop light industry accordingly, it is likely that there will be a special shortage of goods, which will affect the stability of prices and the market. Especially in rural areas, if there are not enough industrial products to exchange for agricultural products at stable and reasonable prices, it may hinder the consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance and may affect the development of agricultural production.
    As for how to achieve a balance between light and heavy industries, should their ratio be set at eight to one or seven to one? I have discussed this extensively in my previous article, so I will not repeat it here. The previous article also discussed how light industry can use the funds it earns to supply heavy industry.
    (II) Balance between Existing and Newly Built Industries
        (A) In Light Industry
    The correct relationship between existing and newly built industries should be that when increasing production to meet social needs, we should first consider giving full play to the production potential of existing industries. During the First Five-Year Plan period, about 90% of light industrial production relied on existing industries, and about 60% or more of the total output value of light industry in the country belonged to the production of the original private industry and handicrafts. Now, the vast majority of private industries have realized joint state-private ownership, and handicrafts have realized cooperation. If necessary production reorganization, enterprise reform, and technical transformation are carried out on this basis, then huge production potential will surely be brought into play. Giving full play to the production potential of existing industries not only requires strengthening production management and balancing equipment work, but also includes necessary and possible reconstruction and expansion. Because reconstruction and expansion of existing industries require less investment, faster construction, and greater benefits than building new ones. It can also save on technical personnel and management cadres. Even new industries need the support of existing industries. Therefore, any idea that ignores existing industries is wrong. The experience of Soviet economic construction is a good proof. During the Fifth Five-Year Plan in the Soviet Union, although the plan to put new production capacity into use in industry was not completed, due to the result of giving full play to the production potential of existing enterprises, the production plans of major industrial sectors were overfulfilled. During the Soviet Sixth Five-Year Plan, the proportion of increased production relying on existing enterprises to give play to production potential in the growth of important industrial product output was: more than 40% for products such as steel, refined copper, zinc, excavators, and electric locomotives, and nickel caustic soda, water turbines, metal cutting machine tools, automobiles, tractors, window glass, paper, sugar and other products accounted for 50% to 60% respectively. This shows that the important role of existing industrial enterprises in the national construction cause cannot be ignored. Even for those existing enterprises in China with relatively backward technology and management, a negative attitude cannot be adopted. But this does not mean that we can ignore newly built industries because we attach importance to existing industries, because when the production potential of existing industries has been fully utilized but still cannot meet social needs, then new construction must be carried out.
    According to reports from those in charge of the Ministry of Textile Industry, the equipment utilization rate of old factories here is already quite tight, and there is no more potential to be tapped. Therefore, during the First Five-Year Plan period, we have already carried out some new construction in the textile, paper, sugar, and pharmaceutical industries. Therefore, during the Second Five-Year Plan period, the capital construction tasks of light industry will be much heavier than the First Five-Year Plan, and the proportion of investment in light industry to industrial investment should also be higher than the 12% or so in the first five years.
    During the Second Five-Year Plan, the proportion of textile industries such as wool, hemp, and silk should also be appropriately increased. The artificial fiber industry is a newly emerging part of the textile industry, and it is developing rapidly in countries around the world. In some countries with relatively developed textile industries, artificial fibers account for about 30% to 35% of their total production of various fibers, but currently in our country it is still in the experimental stage and must strive to catch up. Although the output of wood pulp in our country is not large, the resources of cotton linters are very rich, which is a favorable condition for the development of the artificial fiber industry. During the Second Five-Year Plan, a foundation should be laid for the development of the artificial fiber industry. (B) In Heavy Industry
    In heavy industry, the problem is slightly different. What light industry needs is the construction of new factories, while what heavy industry urgently needs is the reconstruction of old factories. In recent years, the steel industry has achieved great success in adopting new technologies as a result of learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. In 1956, some technical and economic indicators, such as blast furnaces, were close to the Soviet level in 1955. The newly built steel enterprises have adopted the latest Soviet technology and equipment, which will create favorable conditions for production technology to reach the world's advanced level. However, building new steel bases is a basic method, but because the construction time is long, the investment is large, and it cannot take effect immediately, so it cannot be used for emergency relief, but is a long-term plan. Although the three steel industry bases in Wuhan, Baotou, and Anshan will continue to be constructed this year, in order to achieve the purpose of less investment, faster construction, and immediate results, that is, immediate use for emergency relief, the only way is to tap the potential of old factories. Therefore, today's problem lies in reconstructing old factories that have not undergone technical transformation. These old factories have simple and outdated equipment, small factory buildings, and poor transportation and labor conditions. In recent years, the government has spent a considerable amount of investment in old factories, but most of it has been used to expand the capacity of individual production equipment. There is also a lack of systematic planning for system transformation and investment allocation. Therefore, the equipment in old factories is still very backward, the production conditions are very poor, and the quality of products and the adoption of new technologies have been greatly restricted. There is clearly an imbalance between new and old factories. Some old steel plants still use coal as heating fuel, which results in uneven heating of steel ingots and steel materials, and the temperature is more difficult to control than using electricity or gas, which affects product quality. There is a lack of meters for metering and process control, the degree of mechanization is very poor, and there is no talk of automation of operations. Some old steel plants do not have scales for weighing molten steel, and workers climb onto the steel ladles to measure the height of the molten steel surface with steel bars. In adopting new technologies such as oxygen steelmaking and vacuum casting, there is a lack of large oxygen generators and vacuum pumps. The layout of the factory buildings and labor conditions are very poor, indicating that old factories now need to carry out technical transformation and add equipment to create conditions for the adoption of new technologies, so that new and old factories can develop in a more balanced manner. But this can only be said to be a way to provide emergency relief. Using this method to tap potential is ultimately limited and cannot achieve a large increase in production. Therefore, the fundamental solution is to build large-scale steel enterprises. Therefore, the government's decision to continue construction of the three steel (details in Section VIII) industrial bases in Wuhan, Baotou, and Anshan this year is correct.
    (III) Balance between Coastal and Inland Industries
      (A) Gradually Shifting the Focus of Industry to the Interior
  Although some of China's original light industry is scattered in the interior, most of it is concentrated in coastal areas. How to view these coastal industries has become the most controversial issue. This reflects the irrational distribution of industry in old China, which is a malformed phenomenon that prevents the balanced development of China's entire national economy. If the national economy cannot achieve balanced development, then the theory of comprehensive balance cannot be discussed. The distribution of China's original industry reflects the semi-feudal and semi-colonial state of China in the past. According to the statistics in 1952, the total industrial output value of the seven coastal provinces and three cities accounted for about 73% of the total industrial output value of the country; in terms of heavy industry, taking the steel industry as an example, about 80% or more of the production capacity was distributed along the coast, mainly in Anshan, while in Inner Mongolia, the Northwest, the Southwest, Central China, and other places with very rich resources that have not yet been explored and developed, there is almost no steel industry. In terms of light industry, taking the textile industry as an example, 80% of the spindles and 90% of the looms are distributed along the coast, while there are very few textile factories in the vast cotton-producing areas and the interior. The distribution of other light and heavy industries is roughly the same. In order to change this irrational distribution left over from old China, and to establish a complete industrial system in our country, it is necessary to concentrate the main forces to build new industrial bases in the interior, so as to rationally distribute industrial productive forces through the construction of several five-year plans. This has become one of the important tasks for the planned development of China's national economy. Therefore, during the First Five-Year Plan period, we have gradually shifted the focus of industry to the interior, so that industrial enterprises are close to natural resources, and the layout of industry is suitable for the conditions of resources and national defense. In Inner Mongolia and other places, new industrial bases are planned to be built to promote the economic and cultural development of minority areas. In the first four years of the First Five-Year Plan, the construction of new industrial cities has progressed rapidly. Many ancient cities have become young and prosperous, and the irrational conditions left over from the old society are changing. Anshan, China's first steel base, has developed into one of the largest steel cities in the Far East. Taiyuan, Xi'an, Lanzhou, Baotou, Luoyang, Hankou and other places in the interior of our country are being built into new industrial cities. In these places where there was almost no industry or little industry in the past, new steel joint enterprises, huge oil refineries, heavy machinery plants and power stations, as well as textile and sugar factories, some have been built, and some are under construction. The population of these cities has increased a lot, and industrial production is also constantly rising.
    (B) At the same time, fully utilize the industry of coastal provinces
    Comrade Zhou Enlai said in his report on the proposal for the Second Five-Year Plan: "During the Second Five-Year Plan period, we must continue to carry out the construction of industrial bases centered on the steel industry in the Central China and Inner Mongolia regions, and actively carry out the construction of new industrial bases centered on the steel industry and large-scale hydropower stations in the Southwest, Northwest, and the surrounding areas of Sanmenxia, continue to carry out the construction of the petroleum industry and non-ferrous metal industry in the Xinjiang region, and strengthen the geological work in the Tibet region to prepare conditions for the development of Tibet's industry." But this does not mean that we can deny or ignore the role of the industry in the coastal provinces. We should make full use of the favorable conditions in the coastal provinces and continue to appropriately develop industry there to help the development of industry in the interior and accelerate the industrialization of the country. This is not only to meet the growing needs of the country and the people, but also to establish a more powerful industrial base in the interior. Therefore, Comrade Zhou Enlai also suggested in the report: "During the Second Five-Year Plan period, we should continue to strengthen the industrial base in the Northeast, make full use of and appropriately strengthen the industry in the coastal cities in East China, North China, and South China to give play to their role in national construction." During the First Five-Year Plan period, Liaoning, Shanghai, Tianjin and other places have played a significant role. For example, Shanghai has transferred a large number of technical personnel and skilled workers to support construction in various places in the past few years, and has also trained a certain number of technicians. Of course, it will continue to play its role in the future. However, in order to march towards science, most of the young people in the city have already gone to school, and the source of talent training is lacking. In the past, the government issued instructions to dissuade farmers from blindly flowing into the cities in order to prevent affecting agricultural production, which was completely necessary at that time. Under the new situation, in order to meet the needs of training technicians, it seems that rural youths should be recruited in a planned way and trained, so that the city can not only transfer cadres to support national construction, but also supplement new forces to meet the needs of production. At the same time, in the past few years, Shanghai has lost a lot of technical personnel and has not replenished enough. Very few college graduates are assigned to Shanghai (especially in electrical and mechanical fields), which has a certain impact on the role of the coastal industrial base. Some people say: "Some departments of the central government ask for more and give less to old factories and old areas, and take more and give less to technical personnel and college students." This approach is not to use it on the basis of appropriate strengthening and active development, but actually weakens it. In the future, in the work of training and deploying technical forces, while new factories in the interior are carrying out capital construction, most of the cadres and technical personnel allocated to the new factories in the interior can first be sent to the old factories of the same type in the coastal areas for internships. When the new factories in the interior are completed, most of the cadres and workers needed can be uniformly deployed in the old factories in the coastal areas. Taking this approach is conducive to the new factories in the interior being put into production as soon as possible. Industrial leaders in Shanghai are eagerly hoping that the central competent authorities will pay attention to this matter. In the report of Vice Premier Li Xiannian at the National People's Congress in 1956, it was mentioned that in order to meet the needs of economic development, a large number of skilled workers will be trained. The plan of seventeen ministries in 1956 will reach 710,000, which is very exciting. Coastal industries not only transfer a large number of technical personnel every year, train skilled workers for new factories in the interior, but also accumulate funds for new factories in the interior. Take Shanghai as an example. At present, Shanghai supplies one-third of the country's needs for yarn and cloth and 60% of daily necessities. It has also played an active leading role in new products and new technologies, and has accumulated a large amount of funds for the country. This shows that giving play to the industrial potential of coastal areas not only does not contradict the development of industry in the interior, but also promotes the development of industry in the interior. Of course, some industries in coastal areas have certain irrational factors due to the high degree of concentration and being far away from raw material production areas and sales markets. To change this situation, we cannot simply use the method of "limiting production", nor can we generally use the method of "relocating factories", but should, with the development of production, after fully and rationally giving play to the production potential of the industry in the coastal areas, if there is still a need to build new factories, except for a few that must be built in the coastal areas, they should generally be built in the interior to reduce the transportation of raw materials and products to each other. When rebuilding and expanding factories in coastal areas, we also need to consider not creating new irrationalities. This is the correct way to give play to the positive factors in coastal and inland areas.
    (C) Reconstructing and Expanding the Industry of Coastal Provinces
    The above-mentioned avoidance of creating new irrationalities means avoiding blindness, which is often manifested in new construction, reconstruction, and expansion. That is, to reconstruct those enterprises that are necessary and possible to reconstruct, rather than to reconstruct all existing enterprises. In cities where there are already many industrial enterprises, generally fewer new enterprises should be built. Enterprises that are newly built and reconstructed must pay attention to the source of raw materials, the sale of products, production technology, and transportation conditions, and pay attention to the rational division of labor with other regions.
    In terms of capital construction, there are many heavy or light industrial enterprises in coastal areas that can be appropriately reconstructed in combination with the socialist transformation and production reorganization in these areas. This reconstruction will not only hinder the construction of new industrial bases centered on heavy industry throughout the country, but can also support and cooperate with the construction of new industrial bases and supplement the shortcomings of new industrial construction in the interior. Because in these areas, carrying out appropriate reconstruction generally has the following favorable conditions: (1) There is a relatively good foundation in terms of technical strength and technical experience; (2) It is more convenient in terms of transportation, power supply, and cooperation with various parties; (3) There is direct support and help from the original cities. Therefore, carrying out reconstruction in these areas is more economical in terms of investment, more effective, and can meet the urgent needs of the country and the people in a timely manner. Taking the situation in Shanghai as an example, after a working group jointly organized by the First Ministry of Machine Industry and the Planning Commission went to Shanghai to study in the spring of 1956, it suggested reconstructing twenty-two local state-owned and joint state-private electromechanical factories. The preliminary calculation for reconstructing these twenty-two factories only requires an investment of more than 42 million yuan, while the annual output value after the reconstruction is completed can reach 220 million yuan, and almost all the investment can be recovered in one year. After recovering the investment, funds can be accumulated for new enterprises. The Shanghai Zhonghua Iron Factory, which is included in the working group's reconstruction plan, can manufacture two sets of paper machines with a daily output of 50 tons per year according to the current factory buildings and equipment. After the expansion with an investment of 5 million yuan, it can manufacture eight sets of paper machines with a daily output of 50 tons per year. The price of this paper machine is cheaper than imported from abroad, which not only solves the needs of the country, but also saves foreign exchange. Examples like this exist in other industries and other coastal cities. However, in the past, due to insufficient understanding of the point of fully and rationally utilizing the original industrial base in the coastal areas, there were more concerns, and the combination with the construction in the interior was not enough. Therefore, there has not been more active planning and utilization. In the next one or two years, research should be conducted in this area and measures should be taken to combine the reconstruction in the coastal areas and the construction in the interior more rationally and arrange them appropriately. To arrange them well, attention should be paid to balancing the coastal and inland areas in terms of region, scale, variety, quantity, and time, so as to avoid blind development. The next section will give a few examples to illustrate this point.
    The important role of the original coastal industry not only exists during the First Five-Year Plan period, but also exists during the long-term plan in the future. Because at any time, the new inland industrial construction must rely on the original coastal enterprises to better give play to production potential, provide technical talents, accumulate funds, and supply equipment for the construction of new enterprises in the interior.
    (IV) Balance between Industrial Construction and Urban Construction
    The above shows that the coastal cities with the original industrial base must be fully utilized to tap their production potential, and it should also be combined with the socialist transformation and production reorganization in these areas to carry out appropriate reconstruction of many enterprises. In this way, the specific policy of coastal industrial reconstruction is related to the nature of the urban planning itself. Because the utilization, tapping, and reconstruction of coastal industrial production enterprises must be accompanied by the corresponding utilization, tapping, and reconstruction of urban construction (urban public utilities) that are closely related to it. Comrade Zhou Enlai also said in his report on the proposal for the Second Five-Year Plan: With the rational distribution of industrial productive forces, we will build many new cities and expand many existing cities. For this reason, we should strengthen urban planning and construction to coordinate with industrial construction. Generally speaking, this coordination work has been done very well. We have already said in Section III (A): In the first four years of the First Five-Year Plan in our country, the construction of new industrial cities has progressed rapidly, and many ancient cities have become young and prosperous, and the irrational conditions left over from the old society are changing. But this is the general situation in the country. If we talk about the situation of individual cities, there are still some places that are not very satisfactory. The situation in coastal cities such as Shanghai and Dalian is more serious, but the situation in Jilin is even more serious. Now let's take Shanghai's urban public utilities as an example. Due to the long-term bloody rule of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries for more than 100 years before liberation, they established some foundations to meet the needs of plunder, exploitation, and licentious enjoyment, but that was a chaotic, fragmented, malformed, dilapidated, and unbalanced foundation, and an extremely unreasonable foundation. The establishment and reconstruction of cities are mainly to develop industrial production, and also to provide laboring people with good living, labor, education, transportation, and recreational conditions. That is, the municipal construction of socialist cities should adopt the policy of serving production first and serving the laboring people. But looking at the current situation in some cities, we cannot help but pay special attention to at least three things: (1) There is a serious shortage of employee housing; (2) The environmental sanitation is very poor; (3) The traffic is very congested.
    Taking employee housing as an example, let's take Dalian-Lushun City as an example. Dalian-Lushun City is not only a coastal industrial city, but also a frontier of national defense. The industry is mainly concentrated in the Ganjingzi and Shahekou districts. Most of the houses and other public facilities were built during the enemy and puppet rule. The layout of urban construction can be said to have been basically finalized. Various public facilities have a certain degree of modernization, but they are mostly concentrated in areas where the Japanese used to live, and rarely distributed to places where Chinese laborers live. During the enemy and puppet rule, Chinese employees lived in dilapidated, damp, dark, and cramped small houses for many years, and many employees lived far away from the factory, some as far as dozens of miles away from the factory, which was inconvenient for travel. After the liberation of Dalian-Lushun, three relatively large-scale housing adjustments were carried out, and residents with extremely poor living conditions were moved into houses with better living conditions. However, since the restoration and development of the national economy after liberation has been very rapid, and the urban population has increased year by year, especially the development of the Ganjingzi Industrial Zone has been even faster, the contradiction between the demand and supply of housing has continued to increase. According to statistics at the end of March 1956, there were still more than 11,000 employee households without housing. Among them, some people arranged their families in hotels, guest houses, factories, and offices. Many people are separated from their wives and live in collective dormitories or relatives' homes. It is not uncommon for three generations or two or three households to live in one room, and even more people live in warehouses, bathhouses, basements, kitchens, etc., where they do not see sunlight all year round. As for those who apply for housing in preparation for marriage or want to bring their families, they are increasing year by year. Many employees live too far away from the factory, and some workers even need three hours to travel back and forth. This will either shorten the employee's time in the factory, affecting the employee's learning of culture and technology and attending necessary meetings, or will inevitably make it difficult for the employee to maintain sufficient rest time and affect their health. According to incomplete statistics, there are more than 15,000 households that need to continue to be adjusted and relocated. Among them, 3,700 households of employees in the Ganjingzi Industrial Zone, which is more than ten kilometers away from the city center, need to be adjusted and relocated to live near the Ganjingzi District. There are also more than 6,000 households of employees and residents living in dilapidated wooden houses on the edge of the urban area, and they must also be gradually moved to other places. In recent years, a considerable part of the funds have been taken out from the real estate rental income to repair houses every year, and some funds have been squeezed out to build some employee dormitories. However, to completely solve the problem of housing shortage in the city, it will take a considerable period of time to accumulate a considerable amount of funds to do it. The local government estimates that by 1967, the built-up area of Dalian will increase from 667,000 people at the end of 1955 to 720,000 people. During this period, a total investment of more than 120 million yuan is required. Such a large amount of funds cannot be solved simply by relying on local real estate rental income, and most of it still relies on the central and provincial governments to provide assistance in investment. It seems that the fiscal powers of the central and local governments should be clarified as soon as possible, so that the local governments can actively strive to raise funds and strive to solve the contradiction between housing needs and supply as soon as possible. Dalian is still a coastal city, as for inland cities, the phenomenon of disconnection between industrial construction and urban construction is even more serious.
    In terms of environmental sanitation, safety and order, the state has allocated more than 1 billion yuan to build urban public utilities in the past four years. A total of thirty-eight water plants have been built across the country, and more than 2,000 kilometers of water pipelines have been laid. Eleven cities that did not have tap water before now have tap water. The number of people using tap water nationwide has increased by more than 8 million. Xi'an, a historical city in our country, has replaced the bitter water that has been eaten since ancient times with tap water. Lanzhou, an ancient city on the bank of the Yellow River, has been drinking the turbid Yellow River water for generations, and now it has temporary tap water. In the past four years, a total of 2,000 kilometers of sewers have been built across the country, and fifteen cities that had no sewers have built sewers. These construction results have greatly improved the urban sanitation in our country. However, the environmental sanitation in individual cities and many areas is still very poor.
    In terms of urban transportation, the urban public transportation industry has also developed greatly in the past four years. There are now public buses and trams in fifty-two cities across the country, with an increase of more than 1,500 buses and more than 200 trams. Cities such as Lanzhou have also built ring railways. Many cities have opened up new roads and repaired old roads. There are 3,600 kilometers of asphalt roads, gravel roads, or concrete roads built. Cities such as Beijing have also improved the transportation conditions for farmers in the suburbs and residents in the alleys. This is the general situation of urban transportation development nationwide. However, for individual major cities, there is still a considerable distance from the requirements of urban residents.
    The above examples are enough to prove a key point - that is, industrial reconstruction and expansion must be carried out simultaneously with modern urban construction in order to achieve balanced development between the two. A modern industrial city should have modern means of transportation. Before modern means of transportation replace backward means of transportation, backward means of transportation are ultimately much more advanced than "walking on two feet" and "carrying burdens on two shoulders." (V) Balance between Industrial Enterprises and Transportation Enterprises
    Let's take Shanghai as an example. The congested traffic there affects the lives of urban residents, and the congestion of Shanghai Port affects the supply of materials and import and export trade in many areas, not only affecting the lives of residents in Shanghai. The backlog of materials entering Sichuan has caused shortages in markets throughout Sichuan, affecting the lives of the people of Sichuan.
    At present, the phenomenon of material backlog and port and station congestion has appeared in many areas across the country. This is different from the past local seasonal transportation tension, but is universal and continuous. In the second half of 1956, there were 2.7 million tons of goods in coastal, Yangtze River, and Hebei and Shandong inland rivers that could not be transported, and the national transportation lacked a large number of automobiles. This transportation congestion has affected all aspects of politics, economy, and people's lives. For example, in the Karamay and Qaidam oil areas, many urgently needed materials cannot be transported in, threatening the progress of exploration work; in steel industrial bases such as Anshan Steel and Baotou, the supply of ore and equipment is not timely, affecting steel production and capital construction.
    The reason for the transportation congestion is mostly due to the fast growth of transportation volume and the slow growth of transportation capacity, resulting in an imbalance in development. For example, comparing 1956 with 1952: the turnover of sea freight increased by 151%, while the tonnage of ships increased by only 22%; the turnover of Yangtze River freight increased by 258%, while the tonnage of ships increased by 157%. The turnover of automobile freight in 1955 increased by 270% compared with 1952, while the transportation capacity (total tonnage of automobiles) increased by only 33.9%. It shows that transportation construction is far behind the objective practical needs, and simply relying on giving play to the potential of various transportation tools and equipment cannot solve the problem of transportation congestion. Therefore, this problem must be approached from two aspects: on the one hand, we must give full play to the potential of existing transportation equipment and complete transportation tasks to the maximum extent; on the other hand, we must accelerate transportation construction, increase transportation equipment, and maintain a proportion that is adapted to the development of industry and agriculture. In terms of giving play to potential, the vast number of peasants across the country have built many simple roads after agricultural cooperation. In navigation projects, we built the Xiamen Seawall, expanded Huangpu Port and Lianyungang Port, and used Tanggu New Port ahead of schedule. The Sichuan River Channel has been initially rectified, new-style navigation marks have been built, and the famous Sichuan River natural danger has been implemented for night navigation. In terms of new transportation construction, the vast number of soldiers and civilians and employees actively participated in transportation construction work, and restored and built 100,000 kilometers of highways before and after. Adding the 75,000 kilometers of highways in the country at the beginning of liberation, there are a total of 180,000 kilometers of traffic mileage. Among them, the main ones are the Kangzang and Qingzang highways leading to Tibet, which have huge political and economic significance, and the highways in Fujian and Hainan Island. The completely modernized Zhanjiang Port and Yuxikou Port in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River are currently under construction and will be completed this summer. In this way, the efficiency of automobile transportation and ship port work has been greatly improved. In 1955, the transportation efficiency of automobiles increased by 127% compared with 1952, and the cost decreased by 27%; in 1955, the transportation efficiency of seagoing ships increased by 37.8% compared with 1952, the Yangtze River tugboat increased by 244.7%, the loading and unloading efficiency of seaports increased by 71%, the cost of water transportation decreased by 40%, and the freight rate decreased by 30%. Although the highway and water transportation industries have developed to some extent, they are still not adapted to the speed of industrial and agricultural production development.
    However, the government pays great attention to water transportation. Water transportation is the most economical transportation, with low cost, large transportation volume, and saving steel. Therefore, the government built Zhanjiang Commercial Port. The construction of this commercial port is a major project with complex technology. It is the first time in Chinese history to build such a modern seaport with its own technical strength. After the completion of the first phase of the commercial port project, according to the design task, the throughput capacity will reach 1.6 million tons; seagoing freighters of 10,000 tons with a draft of 8.9 meters can enter the port, and cargo loading and unloading operations are basically carried out by machinery. Everyone knows that Zhanjiang Commercial Port is a good deep-water port on the southern coast of our country, which has great significance and role in developing international trade, especially in developing trade with Southeast Asian countries. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence have been accepted by many countries, especially Southeast Asian countries, and the international situation is trending towards easing. It is estimated that foreign trade will be more frequent in the future, accumulating funds for the country and importing means of production (see the section on the balance of import and export trade in the

    联系中国实际来再谈谈综合平衡理论和按比例发展规律
                          马寅初
    在我的上篇论文（载1956年12月28日29日的人民日报）的结尾中，我曾说，我在这篇论文中，因限于篇幅，只谈到几个环节，没有谈到每个环节中的各方面。例如：工业是一个环节，这个环节中的各方面也应该谈谈，才得称为全面综合平衡理论。工业除重工业和轻工业一个方面之外，还有原有工业和新建工业间的平衡，沿海工业和内地工业间的平衡，原料工业和加工工业间的平衡，中央工业和地方工业间的平衡，大型工业和中小型工业间的平衡等等，因限于篇幅，在这里不谈了，拟另作一文加以详细讨论。兹为完成任务，仍用团团转的方法，写成下篇如下：
    （一）重工业和轻工业间的平衡
    我在上篇已经讲过重工业和轻工业的平衡，在这里，我只把上篇没有谈过的而和这篇有密切关系的一点提出来谈一谈。随着工业生产和基本建设规模的扩大，每年需要的钢铁数量种类是庞大的和繁多的，必须保证满足这种需要，才能使我国工业顺利发展，我们是否可以依靠从国外进口钢材来发展我国的工业呢？显然这条道路是行不通的。因为主要依靠从外国进口钢铁，不仅不能建设起独立的强大工业，而且大量进口钢材也是不可能的。这一点可以用以下的事实证明：1955年美国生产了一亿零六百多万吨钢，国内消费了95％，仅有5％钢材出口（不包括机器的出口）；英国生产了二千万吨钢，出口的只有10％左右，而且主要是输往英属地、英国资本统治的国家以及英国享有优惠待遇的石油开采国家；西德输出钢材的数量也不多。再看社会主义阵营，1955年社会主义各国总共生产了六千多万吨钢，其中苏联生产四千五百万吨。但不管苏联也好，其他兄弟国家也好，都感到钢铁不敷需要。由此可见，要想依靠从国外进口大量钢铁来解决我国工业化的需要是有困难的。民主国家和苏联，虽然愿意对我们作兄弟般和善意的热情帮助，但他们正在忙于建设他们的社会主义社会和共产主义社会，加多了他们的钢铁输出量，就会推迟他们的社会主义建设进度，这对加强整个社会主义民主阵营力量的意义来讲是没有好处的，只有在不得已的时候才采用这个办法，并只限于少数的优质钢材和特种钢材。我国是社会主义大家庭中的一员，为了使整个社会主义阵营更加繁荣，为了使社会主义阵营拥有更多的金属，我们就必须坚决执行中央所提出的大力发展钢铁工业的方针，迅速提高我国钢铁工业的生产水平。我们在第一个五年计划期中，采取了“集中较大的财力和人力来建设钢铁工业，以求能够用较短的时间建立起我国工业化的基础”的方针。在第二个五年计划中，仍然采取大力发展钢铁工业的方针。在钢铁工业的基础上，还要很快地建立起自己必要的机器制造工业、冶金工业以及其他有关的重工业，不然的话，我们用什么东西去装备轻工业、运输业、建筑业和农业呢？我们就将得不到必要的各种机器，得不到必要的钢材和水泥，得不到必要的电力和燃料，我们的国民经济就将长时期陷于落后的境地。很明显，我们决不能那样做。因此，以重工业为中心的社会主义工业建设的方针是正确的。所以今年（1957）基本建设的规模仍然很大。基本建设投资要占今年全国财政收入的三分之一以上。几百个限额以上的巨大工程，像武汉、包头、鞍山三个钢铁工业基地，吉林化学肥料厂、抚顺东露天煤矿、兰州炼油厂、富拉尔基和太原的重型机器厂等等，将要继续施工。如果完成这个计划，第一个五年计划内的基本建设任务，就将超额完成。
    但我们亦不能片面地强调发展重工业而降低轻工业和其他经济部门发展的重要性。我们应了解，人民对于消费品的需要既然日益增长，如果不相应地发展轻工业，就很可能出现商品特别缺乏的情况，就将影响物价和市场的稳定。特别是在农村中，如果没有足够数量的工业产品以稳定的合理的价格去交换农产品，就可能妨碍工农联盟的巩固，并且就可能影响农业生产的发展。
    至于轻重工业如何达到平衡，它们的比例按八比一规定呢？还是按七比一规定呢？我在上篇论文中已讲得很多，兹不赘。上篇论文也谈到轻工业如何以赚来的资金来供给重工业。
    （二）原有工业和新建工业的平衡
        （甲）在轻工业方面
    原有工业和新建工业的正确关系，应该是在增加生产适应社会需要的时候，首先考虑发挥原有工业的生产潜力。在第一个五年计划期间，轻工业生产大约有90％是依靠原有工业的，而在全国轻工业的产值中，属于原私营工业和手工业生产的，大约占60％以上。现在绝大部分私营工业已经实现了公私合营，手工业已经实现了合作化。如果在这个基础上，进行必要的生产改组、企业改革和技术改造，那就一定能够发挥出巨大的生产潜力。发挥原有工业的生产潜力，不仅要加强生产管理和平衡设备工作，而且也要包括必要和可能的改建、扩建在内，因为对原有工业进行改建、扩建，比起新建来，毕竟是投资少，建设快，收效大，还可以节约技术人员和管理干部。就是新建工业，也需要原有工业的支援。因此，任何忽视原有工业的思想都是错误的。苏联经济建设中的经验，就是很好的证明。苏联在实行第五个五年计划期间，工业方面虽然动用新的生产能力的计划，并没有完成，但是由于发挥原有企业的生产潜力的结果，主要工业部门的生产计划都是超额完成的，苏联第六个五年计划期内，重要工业产品产量的增长额中，依靠原有企业发挥生产潜力，而增产部分的比例为：钢、精铜、锌、挖土机、电机车等产品占40％以上，镍烧碱、水轮帆、金属切削机床、汽车、拖拉机、窗用玻璃、纸张、糖等产品则分别占到50％到60％以上。由此可见，原有工业企业在国家建设事业中的重要作用，是不容忽视的。即使对那些技术设备和经营管理比较落后的我国原有企业，也不能采取消极态度。但这不是说，我们重视原有工业就可以忽视新建工业，因为当原有工业的生产潜力已经得到充分发挥而仍然不能满足社会需要的时候，那就必须进行新建。
    据纺织工业部负责人的报告，这里的老工厂的设备利用率已经相当紧张，再没有什么潜力可以发挥，因此，在第一个五年计划期间，我们对纺织、造纸、制糖、制药等工业，已经进行了一部分新建，因此在第二个五年计划期间，轻工业的基本建设任务，将比第一个五年计划加重很多，轻工业的投资占工业投资的比重，也应该比第一个五年的12％左右有所提高。
    在第二个五年计划期间，还应该适当地增加毛、麻、丝等纺织工业的比重。人造纤维工业是一个新兴的纺织工业部分，世界各国都发展很快，在某些纺织工业比较发达的国家，人造纤维约占它们各种纤维总产量的30％至35％，但目前在我国还在试验阶段，必须努力赶上。我国木浆产量虽然不多，但棉绒资源是很丰富的，这是发展人造纤维工业的有利条件。在第二个五年计划期间，应当为发展人造纤维工业打下基础。	（乙）在重工业方面
    在重工业方面，问题稍有不同，轻工业所需的是新厂的建设，而重工业所亟迫需要的是旧厂的改建。数年来钢铁工业在采用新技术方面，由于学习苏联先进经验的结果，取得了很大的成绩。1956年有些技术经济指标如高炉已接近苏联1955年的水平。新建的钢铁企业都是采用了苏联的最新的技术装备，这将为生产技术达到世界先进水平创造有利条件。但新建新的钢铁基地，虽然是一种基本的办法，但是由于建设时间长，投资大，而且不能立时生效，所以不能用来救急，而是一种长远的计划。虽然今年武汉、包头、鞍山三个钢铁工业基地仍然继续施工，但欲达到投资少，建设快，可以立时见效即可以立时用来救急的目的，只有就旧厂来发掘潜力，故今日的问题在于改建还没有经过技术改造的旧厂，这些旧厂设备简陋陈旧，厂房狭小，运输和劳动条件差。几年来政府对旧厂已花了相当数量的投资，但大部分用于扩大个别生产设备的能力。对于系统改造、投资分配也缺少系统的规划，因此，旧厂的设备仍然很落后，生产条件很差，产品的质量和新技术的采用受了很大的限制。新厂和旧厂之间显然有不平衡的现象。有的旧钢铁厂，仍以煤为加热燃料，以致钢锭钢材加热不匀，温度比用电力或煤气难于控制，影响产品质量。计量和生产过程控制的仪表都很缺少，机械化的程度很差，更谈不到操作的自动化。有的旧钢厂没有称钢液重量的磅称，凭工人爬上盛钢桶用钢条来睬测钢液面的高低。在采用氧气炼钢，真空浇注等新技术，则缺乏大型的氧气机和真空泵。厂房的布置和劳动条件很差，说明现在旧厂需要进行技术改造，增添设备为采用新技术创造条件，使新旧厂得以比较地平衡发展。但这只可以说是一种救急的办法，用这种办法来挖掘潜力，到底有限，不能得到大量的增产。因此根本的解决办法是新建大规模的钢铁企业，因此政府决定武汉、包头、鞍山三个钢铁（详第八节）工业基地今年将继续施工的做法是正确的。
    （三）沿海工业和内地工业的平衡
      （甲）工业重点逐步移向内地
  我国原有的轻工业虽有一部分分散在内地，但大部分集中在沿海地区。如何看待这些沿海工业成为争论最多的问题。这是反映了旧中国工业分布的不合理，是一种畸形的现象，致使我国整个国民经济不能得到平衡的发展。国民经济不能得到平衡的发展，则综合平衡理论亦无从谈起。我国原有工业的分布状况反映了我国过去的半封建半殖民地的状况。据1952年的统计，沿海七省三市的工业总产值，约占全国工业总产值的73％；在重工业方面，以钢铁工业为例，大约有80％以上的生产能力分布在沿海，主要是在鞍钢，而在资源非常丰富而尚未勘探开发的内蒙古、西北、西南、华中等地却几乎没有什么钢铁工业。在轻工业方面，以纺织工业为例，也有80％的纱锭和90％的布机分布在沿海，而在广大的产棉区和内地却很少纺织工厂。其他轻重工业的分布情况，大致也是如此。为了改变这种旧中国所遗留下来的不合理的分布状况，为了建立我国完整的工业体系，就需要集中主要力量来在内地建设新的工业基地，以便经过几个五年计划的建设来合理地分布工业生产力。这就成为有计划地发展我国国民经济的重要任务之一。因此，我们在第一个五年计划期间，已经把工业重点逐步移向内地，使工业企业接近自然资源，使工业的布局适合于资源和国防的条件，在内蒙古等地有计划地建设新的工业基地，促进少数民族地区经济和文化的发展。在第一个五年计划前四年中新工业城市的建设进展很快，许多古老的都市变得年青而繁荣，旧社会遗留下来的不合理的状况正在改观。我国第一个钢铁基地鞍山，已经发展成为远东最大的钢铁城市之一。我国内地的太原、西安、兰州、包头、洛阳、汉口等地，正在建成新的工业城市。在这些过去几乎没有工业或工业不多的地方，新的钢铁联合企业，巨大的炼油厂，重型机械厂和发电站，以及纺织和制糖等工厂，有的已经建成，有的正在建设。这些城市的人口增加了很多，工业生产也在不断上升。
    （乙）同时充分利用沿海各省的工业
    周恩来同志在他的关于第二个五年计划的建议的报告中说：“在第二个五年计划期间，必须继续进行华中和内蒙古两地区以钢铁工业为中心的工业基地的建设，积极进行西南、西北和三门峡周围等地区以钢铁工业和大型水电站为中心的新工业基地的建设，继续进行新疆地区石油工业和有色金属工业的建设，并且加强西藏地区的地质工作，为发展西藏的工业准备条件。”但这决不是说可以否认或者忽视沿海各省的工业的作用。我们应该充分利用沿海各省的有利条件，继续适当地发展那里的工业，以帮助内地工业的发展，加速全国的工业化。这不但是为了适应国家和人民日益增长的需要，而且也正是为了在内地建立更强大的工业基地。因此，周恩来同志又在报告中建议：“在第二个五年计划期间，应该继续加强东北的工业基地，充分利用和适当加强华东、华北、华南各地区近海城市的工业，以发挥它们在国家建设中的作用。”在第一个五年计划期间，辽宁、上海、天津等地已经发挥了显著的作用。如上海过去几年来输送了大量技术人员、熟练工人支援各地建设，亦培养了一定数量的技工，今后当然还要发挥它的作用。可是为了向科学进军，城市青年已经大部就学，培养人才的来源感到缺乏。政府过去为了防止影响农业生产，曾作出了劝止农民盲目流入城市的指示，这在当时是完全必要的。在新形势之下，为了培养技工的需要，似应有计划地招收农村青年，加以培养，使得城市既可以输送干部支援国家建设，又可以补充新的力量，满足生产上的需要。同时，几年来，像上海的技术人员抽得很多，补得太少，大专毕业学生分配到上海的寥寥可数（特别是电机、机械方面），这对发挥沿海工业基地的作用有一定程度的影响。有人说：“中央有的部门，对老厂、老地区要得多，给得少，对技术人员抽得多，大中学生补得少。”这种做法不是在适当增强和积极发展的基础上来利用它，而是实际上削弱它。今后，在技术力量的培训调配工作上，在内地新厂进行基本建设的同时，可以先将配给内地新厂的大部分干部和技术人员，放到同类型的沿海老厂中去实习，在内地新厂建成时，需要的干部和工人就可以大部分在沿海老厂中统一调配。采取这种做法，有利于内地新厂尽速投入生产。上海的工业界领袖们切盼中央主管部门能够对此事加以注意。在1956年全国人民代表大会上，李先念副总理的报告中提到为了适应经济发展的需要，将要大量培养熟练工人，1956年十七个部的计划就将达到七十一万人，这是十分令人兴奋的事。沿海工业不仅每年输送出去大量的技术人员，为内地新工厂培养熟练工人，而且也为内地新工厂积累资金。以上海为例。目前上海供应了全国纱布需要量的三分之一，和日用百货的60％，在新产品、新技术方面也起了积极的带头作用，并为国家积累了大量资金。由此可见，发挥沿海地区的工业潜力，不仅和发展内地工业不相矛盾，而且还会促进内地工业的发展。当然沿海工业中的某些行业，由于集中程度较大，远离原料产地和销售市场是存在着某些不合理因素的。要改变这种情况，不能简单地用“限产”的办法，一般地也不能用“迁厂”的办法，而应该随着生产的发展，在充分地合理地发挥了沿海地区工业的生产潜力以后，如果还需要新建工厂的时候，除少数必须建在沿海地区外，一般应该建在内地，以减少原料和产品的相向运输。在对沿海工厂进行改建扩建的时候，也需要考虑到不要造成新的不合理。这是发挥沿海和内地积极因素的正确办法。
    （丙）改建和扩建沿海各省的工业
    以上所谓不要造成新的不合理，就是要避免盲目性，这种盲目性往往表现在新建改建和扩建的时候。就是改建那些有必要也有可能改建的企业，而不是改建一切原有企业。在工业企业已经比较多的城市，一般应该少建新的企业。新建和改建的企业，必须注意到原料的来源，产品的销售，生产的技术和运输等条件，并且注意同其他地区的合理分工。
    在基本建设方面，在沿海地区有不少的重工业或轻工业企业，可以结合这些地区的社会主义改造和生产改组，来进行适当的改建。这种改建，不仅不会妨碍全国范围内以重工业为中心的新的工业基地的建设，而且可以支持、配合新工业基地的建设和补充内地新工业建设的不足。因为在这些地区，进行适当的改建，一般地都具有下列几个有利条件：（一）在技术力量和技术经验方面，比较有基础；（二）在运输、电力供应以及和各方面的协作上都比较方便；（三）有原有城市的直接支持和帮助。因此，在这些地区进行改建，投资上比较节省，见效也比较迅速，又可以及时地满足国家和人民的迫切需要。以上海的情况为例，第一机械工业部和计划委员会在1956年春季共同组织的工作组去上海研究后，建议改建二十二个地方国营和公私合营的机电工厂。改建这二十二个工厂，初步核算只需要投资四千二百多万元，而改建完成后每年的产值则可达到二亿二千万元，差不多一年就可以将全部投资收回。收回投资后，即可为新企业积累资金。列入工作组改建工厂方案中的上海中华铁工厂，按照目前的厂房和设备，每年可以制造日产量为五十吨的造纸机两套，经过投资五百万元扩建后，每年就可以制造日产量为五十吨的造纸机八套。这种造纸机，价格比国外进口的便宜，既解决了国家的需要，又节省了外汇。像这样的例子，在其他行业，其他沿海城市都有。但过去由于对充分合理地利用沿海原有的工业基础这点认识不足，顾虑较多，同内地建设的结合不够，因之，就还没有更积极地去加以规划和利用。在今后一两年内，这方面还要进行研究，采取措施，使沿海的改建和内地的建设更合理地结合起来，适当安排，而要安排得好，就要注意在地区、规模、品种、数量、时间等各方面都要使沿海和内地相平衡，这样才能避免盲目发展。下一节要举出几个例子说明这一点。
    原有沿海工业的重要作用，不仅仅在第一个五年计划期间是存在的，就是在今后长期计划期间也是存在的。因为不论在任何时候，新的内地工业建设都得依靠原有沿海企业更好地发挥生产潜力，为建设内地新企业供给技术人才，积累资金和供应设备。
    （四）工业建设和城市建设之间的平衡
    以上说明原有工业基础的沿海城市，必须充分利用，以发掘其生产潜力，而且还应当结合这些地区的社会主义改造和生产改组，进行不少企业的适当的改建。这样，沿海工业改建的具体方针，关系着城市本身规划的性质。因为对沿海工业生产企业进行利用、发掘和改建，则同它密切相关的城市建设（城市公用事业），也必然要进行相应的利用、发掘和改建。周恩来同志在他的第二个五年计划的建议的报告中也说：随着工业生产力的合理分布，我们将要建设许多新的城市和扩建许多原有的城市，为此应该加强城市的规划工作和建设工作，求得同工业建设相配合云云。这个配合工作一般地来说，做得很好，我们在第三节甲项中已经说过：在我国第一个五年计划前四年中，新工业城市的建设进展很快，许多古老的都市变得年青而繁荣，旧社会遗留下来的不合理的状况正在改观云云。但这是在全国范围内一般的情形。若以个别城市的情形来讲，尚有不能令人十分满意的地方。上海、大连等沿海城市的情形比较严重，但吉林的情形更为严重。现在先以上海的城市公用事业为例。由于解放前一百多年帝国主义和国民党反动派的长期血腥统治，它们为了满足掠夺剥削和荒淫享乐的需要，多少建立了一些基础，但那是一个混乱的割裂的畸形的残旧的不平衡的基础，是一个极不合理的基础。城市的建立和改建主要是为了发展工业生产，同时也为劳动人民供给良好的居住、劳动、教育、交通和文娱游乐条件。那就是社会主义城市的市政建设，应采取首先为生产服务，为劳动人民服务的方针。但一看若干城市今日的情况，不能不令人格外注意的，至少有三件事：（1）职工住宅严重缺乏；（2）环境卫生非常恶劣；（3）交通非常拥挤。
    以职工住宅来说，以旅大市为例。旅大市不仅是一个沿海工业城市，也是一个国防前哨。工业主要集中在甘井子、沙河口两个区。房屋及其他公共设施大部分是敌伪统治时期修建的。城市建设的布局，可以说已经基本上定型。各种公共设施具有一定程度的现代化规模，但多集中在日本人曾经居住的地区，很少分布到中国劳动人民聚居的地方。在敌伪统治时期，中国职工长年住在破漏潮湿阴暗的小房里，拥挤不堪，并且有许多职工住处离工厂很远，有的住处与工厂相距数十里，往返不便。旅大解放后，先后进行了三次规模较大的住宅调整工作，将居住条件极端恶劣的居民搬进了居住条件较好的房屋。但由于解放后，国民经济的恢复与发展很快，城市人口逐年增加，特别是甘井子工业区的发展更为迅速，因而住宅的需求与供应之间的矛盾，仍然有增无减。截至1956年3月底统计，尚有一万一千余户职工无房居住。他们中间，有些人把家属安置在旅馆、招待所、工厂、办公室里，有许多同妻子分居，分别住在集体宿舍或亲友家里，老少三辈或两三户挤居在一个房间的也不少，住在仓库、澡塘、地下室、厨房等处终年不见阳光的则更多。至于因准备结婚或想接来家眷而申请用房的更是逐年增加。许多职工住处离工厂过远，有些工人甚至往返需要三小时。这样不是使职工留厂时间缩短，影响职工学习文化技术和参加必要的会议，就势必使职工难以保持足够的休息时间而影响健康。据不完全统计，有一万五千余户尚有待于继续调整迁移。其中离市中心十几公里的甘井子工业区职工，需调整迁至甘井子区附近居住的即有三千七百余户。市区的边沿地方还有六千余户职工与居民住在破漏的木板房里，也必须逐步地把他们迁至别处。近几年每年都从房地产租金收入中拿出相当一部分资金整修房屋，并挤出一部分资金，新建一些职工宿舍。但在全市范围内要彻底解决缺房的问题，还需要经过相当长的时期，积聚相当多的一笔资金才能办到。当地政府推算到1967年大连建成区，人口将由1955年底六十六万七千人增加到七十二万人。在这期间，总计需要投资一亿二千余万元。这样多的资金，单纯依靠地方的房地产租金收入显然是不能解决问题的，大部分还有赖于中央和省在投资上给予援助。似应快快把中央与地方财政职权划清，以便地方积极努力筹集资金，争取提早解决住宅的需要和供应之间的矛盾。大连还是沿海城市，至于内地城市，则工业建设和城市建设间的脱节现象更为严重。
    以环境卫生安全秩序来说，最近四年来国家共拨出了十亿多元资金来建设城市公用事业。全国总共建设了三十八个自来水厂，铺设了二千多公里长的自来水管线。十一个从前没有自来水的城市，现在有了自来水。全国用自来水的人数增加了八百多万。我国的历史名城西安，自古以来食用的苦水已经被自来水代替。黄河之畔的古城兰州，世世代代都是食用混浊的黄河河水，现在有了临时的自来水了。在过去的四年内，全国修建的下水道，共有二千公里长，十五个原无下水道的城市修建了下水道。这些建设结果，使我国的城市卫生有了很大的改善。但是个别城市和不少地区的环境卫生仍然很差。
    以城市的交通事业来说，城市的公共交通事业，近四年来也有很大发展。全国现在五十二个城市有公共汽车和电车，共增加了一千五百多辆汽车，二百多辆电车。兰州等城市还修建了环行铁路。许多城市开拓了新路，修整了旧路。只是修建的柏油路、石子路或混凝土路就有三千六百多公里。北京等城市还改善了郊区农民和小巷内居民的交通条件。这是在全国范围内城市交通发展一般的情况。但以个别主要城市来说，则与城市居民的要求还是有相当的距离。
    以上这些例子足以证明一个要点——就是工业改建和扩建一定要和现代化的城市建设同时进行，以求得二者平衡发展。一个现代化工业城市，应该有现代化的交通工具。在现代化交通运输工具没有代替落后交通工具以前，落后交通工具终究比“两脚走路”“两肩挑担”先进得多。（五）工业企业和运输企业间的平衡
    我们举上海为例，那里交通运输拥挤的情形，影响到城市居民的生活，而上海港的阻塞且影响到许多地区的物资供应和进出口贸易，不仅影响到上海一市的居民生活而已。入川物资积压，使四川各地市场脱销，影响着四川人民的生活。
  目前全国不少地区已经出现了物资积压，港口、车站阻塞的现象。这和过去局部的季节性的运输紧张情况有所不同，而是带有普遍性与连续性的。1956年下半年沿海、长江和河北、山东内河即有二百七十万吨货物无力承运，全国运输缺少大量汽车。这个运输阻塞已经影响到政治、经济、人民生活各个方面。例如克拉玛依和柴达木油区，许多急需的物资运不进去，威胁着勘探工作的进行；鞍钢和包头等钢铁工业基地，由于矿砂和器材供应不及时，影响到钢铁生产和基本建设。
    运输阻塞的原因，大半是由于运量增长的快和运力增长的慢，造成发展上不平衡所致。如以1956年同1952年比较：海运货物周转量增长151％，船舶吨位仅增加22％；长江货物周转量增长258％，船舶吨位增加157％。汽车货物周转量1955年比1952年增长270％，而运力（汽车总吨数）仅增加33.9％。足见交通建设远远落后于客观实际需要，仅仅依靠发挥各种运输工具和设备的潜力，不能解决运输阻塞的问题。因此这个问题要从两方面着手：一方面固然要充分发挥现有运输设备潜力，最大限度的完成运输任务；一方面还要加速交通建设，增加运输设备，保持与工农业发展相适应的比例。在发挥潜力方面，全国广大农民在农业合作化后修建了很多简易公路。在航务工程中，我们修建了厦门海堤，扩建了黄浦港与连云港，提前修建使用了塘沽新港。川江航道已经初步进行了整治，建设了新式航标，有名的川江天险已经实行夜航。在交通新建方面，广大军民职工积极参加了交通建设工作，前后恢复和新建十万公里公路，加上解放初期全国七万五千公里，共有通车里程十八万公里。其中主要的有通往西藏的两条具有巨大政治、经济意义的康藏、青藏公路，和福建海南岛等公路。完全近代化的湛江港和长江下游的裕溪口港目前正在建设中，今年夏季可以完工。这样在汽车运输和船舶港口工作效力方面已经大大提高，1955年汽车的运输效率较1952年提高了127％，成本降低了27％；1955年的海船运输效率比1952年提高了37.8％，长江拖轮提高了244.7％，海港装卸效率提高了71％，水运成本降低40％，运价降低30％。这样虽然公路、水运事业均有了一些发展，但与工农业生产发展的速度比较起来，仍然是不相适应的。
    但政府对于水运是十分注意的，水运是最经济的运输，成本低，运量大，节约钢材，所以政府建设了湛江商港。这个商港建设是一项大工程，技术复杂，在中国历史上以自己的技术力量建筑这样一个现代化的海港还是第一次。这个海港的第一期工程任务完成以后，按照设计任务，吞吐能力将达到一百六十万吨；可使吃水八点九公尺的万吨远洋海轮进港，基本上用机械进行货物装卸作业。大家知道湛江商港是我国南部海岸的一个良好的深水港口，对于发展国际贸易特别是对发展东南亚各国贸易有重大的意义和作用。和平共处五项原则已为很多的国家尤其是东南亚国家所接受，国际局势趋于和缓，估计到今后对外贸易更加频繁，为国家积累资金，并输入生产资料（详上篇进出口贸易平衡一节），因此大大地发挥湛江商港效用的政策是正确的。交通部计划今后按照四百六十万吨要求继续进行建设。	（六）中央工业和地方工业的平衡
    以上各节所谈的各种工业企业，无论在沿海各省或在内地，无论是改造的旧厂或新建的新厂（无论是工业企业或运输企业），在中华人民共和国成立以后，为了实现和巩固国家的统一，都集中到中央行政管理职权之内，这在当时是完全必要的。但是近几年来，中央管理的事务有些过多。刘少奇同志在“八大”政治报告中说：中央有些部门把过多的事务抓到自己手里，对地方限制得过多过死，忽视地方的特殊情况和特殊条件，既不利于地方的工作、也分散了中央的精力，发展了官僚主义云云。又如我们在第五节中所讲的，交通运输事业具有复杂、多样、分散的特点，中央和地方、上层和下层之间的分工问题也比较多，应该很好地分级管理事业和企业。巨大的交通运输计划的进行，固然有赖于国家力量的支持和领导，尤其要依靠地方和人民群众的积极性和创造性（如全国广大农民修建了简易公路；山东沿海渔民把大型的木帆船加上马达改为机帆船，提高了载重量和速度；上海港在地方主持下，初步调整了各部门在港区的仓库，对解除上海港的阻塞起了很大作用）。这样才能使未来的远景很快地成为现实。中国各地经济状况不一样，国家领导建设既应争取集中，又须因地制宜，发挥地方灵活性。妥善解决中央和地方的分工，就是改进国家体制问题。过去中国历史上从来没有解决过这个问题，但是在社会主义制度下可以解决的。国务院召开的体制会议，要改进现行的计划体制，财务体制，使上面集中精力，加强领导全面规划，下面也能根据既定的方针政策全力进行工作。但现在的情况不和这个原则相符合。
    过去，由于中央对计划指标的掌握有过多过繁的地方，这就多少束缚了地方的主动性。有时，在国家计划下达以后，由于实际情况发生变化，有些计划指标，如工业计划、商业计划中的分经济类型指标和分季指标需要调整时，地方机关不能自行调整，必须报请国务院批准，这样就影响了有些经济问题的及时解决，给地方机关的工作带来了困难。我们必须认识到，一方面，我国国民经济情况比较复杂，特别是在过渡时期中，由于国家对农业、手工业、资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造，各种经济成份的比重的变化是很快的；另一方面，我国的幅员广阔，各个地区的经济发展情况和资源情况，都有很大的不同，中央还不可能对各个地区的情况掌握得很准确，因此，国家也不可能对各项计划指标不分主次地都采取严格控制的办法，而必须允许地方在国家统一的计划的指导下，保持必要的灵活性。只有这样，才能发展地方积极性和主动性，保证国家计划的完成。例如，以粮食生产计划来说，中央只掌握了根据全国平衡所确定的总产量指标。地方为了完成这一指标，可以根据不同的情况采取不同的办法来保证总产量指标的完成。这样既发挥了地方的积极性，也保证了国家计划的统一性。若不分主次地把种种计划都掌握在国家手里，实际上，不但不能加强计划的指导作用，而且削弱了计划的指导作用。
