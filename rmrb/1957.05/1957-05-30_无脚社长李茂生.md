    Li Maosheng, the 27-year-old Communist Party member and head of the "Five Star" First Agricultural Cooperative in Dongying Township, Juye County, Henan Province, is a first-class disabled soldier. Both his legs were amputated at the knees in Korea due to frostbite injuries. Since returning to his hometown in 1952, he has been deeply loved by the farmers in neighboring villages for his outstanding work. He has been elected as a first-class model at the provincial, county, and township levels eight times in the past few years. In December of last year, he attended the National Conference of Activists of Revolutionary Martyrs' Families, Disabled Soldiers, and Demobilized Soldiers.

    Not long ago, I went to visit this heroic agricultural cooperative head. At that time, he was lying unconscious in bed due to illness. A pair of artificial legs leaned against the bed. I sat quietly for a moment and then quietly walked out of the room. But just as I walked out, Li Maosheng suddenly sat up from the bed and called to a resident cadre who was accompanying me to visit him, saying: "It's time for us to plant pumpkins here. We must mobilize the masses to plant pumpkins on the vacant land on the edge of the village so that we can save grain after the wheat harvest!" The next day I went to see him again, and this legless man had tied on his artificial legs again, limping to the fields to inspect the work.

    Li Maosheng was originally a deputy squad leader in the Chinese People's Volunteers. He had performed many meritorious deeds in battle. In 1952, after he returned to his hometown after being demobilized, the people in the village and his wife persuaded him to take a good rest. But Li Maosheng replied: "I am a Communist Party member. Although my legs have been amputated, I still have hands, and I can still walk with artificial legs. I can't sit idle and do nothing!" He used the production funds given to him by the government to buy a stocking machine. With the help of his wife, Jia Xiulan, he learned to knit socks after three days of continuous learning without getting out of bed. Later, he relied on this income to support his family.

    In the spring of 1954, Li Maosheng linked up six farmers to organize the village's first mutual aid team. In January of the following year, he led the establishment of a preliminary cooperative with fifty-five households. He was elected as the head of this cooperative. At that time, some backward masses thought that he could not produce because he had no legs, and sarcastically said: "Maosheng wants to go to heaven even with crutches!" Individual bad elements took the opportunity to provoke the relationship between the cadres and the masses in the cooperative, creating ideological confusion among the members. Li Maozhi, the production team leader who was not firm in his thinking, also took the lead in demanding to withdraw from the cooperative. At that time, Li Maosheng, regardless of the pain he felt when walking after the amputation of his legs, took the lead in actively leading production, and conducted individual talks with each person and household to dispel the doubts in the minds of the masses, and finally consolidated the cooperative. In the winter of that year, more than 500 farmers from seven villages around Lizhuang Village and the agricultural cooperative led by Li Maosheng merged to form an advanced cooperative, and Li Maosheng was again elected as the head. That year, because the local area had suffered from natural disasters such as wind and hail in the autumn, the cooperative was short of food, and the livestock was short of fodder. Thirteen of the sixty livestock in the Mengyoufang Village production brigade died of illness, and the others were also very weak. Li Maosheng thought: Livestock is the driving force of production, and farmers rely on it for food. If the death and emaciation of livestock are not quickly stopped, the difficulties in the future will be even greater. So he personally moved into the breeding room to live, cooperated with the breeders to check and summarize feeding methods, and established various systems. In less than a month, the livestock were all fed and fattened. In addition, he also took out more than one hundred yuan of his disability pension as capital to lead the cooperative members to engage in sideline production for self-rescue. Last year, the cooperative's crops generally increased production, and about 95% of the members also increased their income.

    The farmers of Lizhuang Village will never forget the legless hero Li Maosheng braving the rain to go into the water to rescue the disaster in 1954. That autumn, because of continuous heavy rain, one night, the river water of the Tonghui Canal, which runs through the edge of Lizhuang Village, surged sharply, and there were many breaches in the dam. The lives and property in the village were about to be threatened. At that time, Li Maosheng was not as steady as he is now when walking, and he was still holding crutches in his hands. When he saw this critical situation, he jumped into the water to grab and block the breach without hesitation. More than one hundred people on the dam were moved and jumped into the water together, and the breach in the dam was quickly repaired. From then on, people respected Li Maosheng even more. Whenever he was sick or his wound was worn out due to working too much, many people would visit him and persuade him to rest. Sometimes when he went to the county or township for meetings, the members would calculate when he should return and automatically push a small cart to pick him up. Each time, Li Maosheng advised the people who came to pick him up, saying: "I can still walk slowly by myself. It's not good for you to pick me up and delay production!"

    Li Maosheng's daily life is also very simple. Originally, his and his wife's labor income for one year, plus the state's pension and disability allowance, totaled about 700 yuan, which would be enough for the family of four to live a better life. However, he never lived a life more special than that of ordinary farmers, whether in terms of food or clothing. Every year, the cloth coupons issued to his family by the state are always not used up. In order to take care of his health and work, the county leaders have repeatedly said to him that he can buy more refined grains and eat better, but he has never bought refined grains even once. This spring, he took out more than eighty catties of grain that he had saved and voluntarily gave it to the needy households in the cooperative. He deposits most of his annual income in credit cooperatives and agricultural cooperatives. In the past few years, more than a dozen poor farmers in his village had borrowed more than one hundred yuan from him because of difficulties, and now he doesn't want them to repay it. Because he is active and willing to work, in the most recent cooperative's evaluation of the labor remuneration of full-time cadres, everyone proposed that his labor remuneration should be the highest among the cadres. Li Maosheng strongly disagreed, saying: "My life is subsidized by the state, and there is no problem at all. My labor remuneration can be waived or reduced, so that cadres with difficulties can have a slightly higher income, and the masses can have a little more share!" He insisted on taking remuneration at a level lower than the income level of ordinary members.

    无脚社长李茂生
    新华社记者　曲明振
    河南省雎县董营乡“五星”第一农业社社长、二十七岁的共产党员李茂生，是个一等残废军人，他的两腿在朝鲜因伤冻被齐膝盖锯掉了。他自1952年复员还乡后，由于出色地进行工作，受到邻近村庄农民的爱戴，几年来，曾连续八次当选为省、县、乡的一等模范，去年12月出席了全国烈军属、残废军人、复员军人积极分子会议。
    不久前，记者前往访问了这位英雄的农业社长。那时，他正病得昏迷不醒地躺在床上。床前靠着一双假腿，我静坐了片刻，便悄悄地走出门去。但刚走出门外，李茂生忽的从床上坐起来，叫住陪我来看他的一位驻社干部说：“咱这里种南瓜的季节到了，要动员群众将村边的空闲地种上南瓜，到麦罢好节省粮食！”我第二天又去见他，这位无脚的人却又绑好了假腿，一跛一跛地下地检查工作去了。
    李茂生原是中国人民志愿军的一个副班长，他在战斗中曾经立过多次功。1952年，他复员回乡后，村里的人和他的妻子都劝他要好好地休养，李茂生却回答说：“我是共产党员，虽然两腿被锯短了，但是我还有手，并且还能用假腿走路，无论如何都不能坐吃清穿！”他用政府发给自己的生产资金买了一部打袜机，他在妻子贾秀兰的帮助下，一连三天不下床地学，终于学会了织袜子。后来，便依靠这个收入来维持家庭生活。
    1954年春，李茂生串连了六户农民组织起了全村的第一个互助组。第二年1月，他又领导建立起了一个五十五户的初级社。他被选为这个社的社长。那时，一些落后群众认为他没脚不能生产，讽刺他说：“茂生拄着拐棍还想上天哩！”个别坏分子又乘机挑拨社内干部和群众的关系，制造社员的思想混乱，思想不坚定的生产队长李茂志也带头闹着要出社。那时李茂生不顾因双腿锯伤后在行路时感到疼痛，一面带头积极领导生产，一面逐人逐户进行个别谈话，解除群众思想上的疑虑，而最后终于把社巩固了起来。这年冬天，李庄周围的七个村五百多户农民和李茂生所领导的农业社合并建成了一个高级社，李茂生又被选为社长。那年因为当地在秋天曾遭受了风、雹等自然灾害袭击，社内人缺口粮，牲口缺饲料，孟油房村生产大队的六十头牲口，病死了十三头，其它的也十分瘦弱。李茂生想：牲口是生产动力，农民要靠它吃饭，如不赶快制止牲畜的死亡瘦弱现象，以后的困难将会更大。于是他亲自搬到饲养室内去住，协同饲养员检查和总结喂养方法，建立各种制度，不到一月，把牲口都喂的肥壮了。另外，他还拿出自己的残废金一百多元作本金，领导全社社员搞副业生产进行自救。去年，全社的农作物全面增产，95％左右的社员也都增加了收入。
    李庄村的农民永远也忘不掉这位无脚英雄李茂生在1954年冒雨下水抢险的事。那年秋季，因为连降大雨，在一天夜里，流经李庄村边的一条通惠渠的河水猛涨，堤上多处决口，眼看村里的生命财产就要受到威胁。那时，李茂生走路还不像现在稳当，手里还扶着双拐，他一看见这种危急情形，便奋不顾身地第一个跳下水去抢堵决口，感动得堤上一百多个群众都一齐跳下水去，大堤的决口很快便被堵复了起来。从此，人们对于李茂生便更加敬重。每当他生病或因工作走路过多而把伤口磨破时，很多人都去看望他，劝他休息；有时他到县里或去乡里开会，社员们算着他该回来的时候，就自动推着小车去接他。每次，李茂生都劝告来接他的人说：“我自己还能慢慢地走，你们来接我，耽误了生产，是不好的！”
    李茂生的日常生活也非常朴素。本来，按说他一年和他妻子俩人的劳动收入，再加上国家发给他的抚恤金、残废金共约有七百元的收入，全家四口人的生活满可以过得好些。但是，他不论吃、穿从来都不比一般农民的生活特殊。每年，国家发给他家的布票总是用不完。县领导上为了照顾他的身体和工作，曾多次对他说，他可以多购点细粮，吃好一些，而他连一次也没买过细粮。今年春天，他又把自己节余下来的八十多斤粮食，拿出来自动让给社内的困难户。他把自己一年的大部分收入都存在信用社和农业社里。前几年，在他村里有十多户贫困农民曾经因为困难向他借过一百多元，现在他也都不要他们偿还了。因为他工作积极肯干，在最近一次社里评定脱产干部的劳动报酬时，大家提议他的劳动报酬应该成为干部中最高的一个。李茂生很不同意，他说：“我的生活有国家补助，一点都没问题，我的劳动报酬可以不要或少要，让有困难的干部稍高一些，群众多分一点！”他坚持一定要按低于一般社员的收入水平来取酬。　（本报特约稿）
