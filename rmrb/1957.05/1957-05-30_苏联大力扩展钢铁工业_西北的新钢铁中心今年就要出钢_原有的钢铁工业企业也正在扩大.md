Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 29th - The Soviet Union is building and expanding many steel industrial enterprises. This year's capital construction investment in this area will be more than 3 billion rubles greater than last year.

The new steel industrial center in the Northwest of the Soviet Union—the Cherepovets Steel Plant near Leningrad—is under construction and will begin to produce its first batch of steel this year. Next to the blast furnaces, coking ovens, sintering plants, and coal preparation plants that have already been put into production, the metal structure of the largest open-hearth furnace workshop in the country has been erected. After the completion of the Cherepovets Steel Plant, it will be combined with the iron ore base on the Kola Peninsula and the Pechora coal region to form a huge industrial triangle in the Northwest of the Soviet Union. This industrial zone, which is as large as several European countries, will fundamentally solve the problem of metal supply in the entire Northwest region of the Soviet Union, where the machine manufacturing industry is highly developed.

The Karaganda Metallurgical Plant in the Kazakh Republic and the Krivoy Rog Steel Plant in the Ukrainian Republic are two other huge new steel industrial enterprises that the Soviet Union is building. The Karaganda plant has recently begun construction of its first blast furnace, which has an effective volume of more than 1,500 cubic meters and will be the largest blast furnace in the Soviet Union. The Krivoy Rog Steel Plant is currently building Bessemer steelmaking workshops, open-hearth furnace workshops, primary rolling workshops, and other production departments. Near this enterprise, a large ore dressing complex is also under construction, with a designed production capacity of 8.6 million tons per year, and it will be the best-equipped ore dressing enterprise in Europe.

Existing steel industrial enterprises are also being expanded. The famous Magnitogorsk Metallurgical Combine, the Kuznetsk Metallurgical Combine, and twenty other enterprises are currently building new rolling workshops, sintering plants, and coking ovens. Among the steel industrial enterprises in the Donbas, 51 new industrial facilities will be put into production this year. Five blast furnaces in steel enterprises such as the Petrovsky Factory and the Kramatorsk Metallurgical Plant will be put into production next year, with a total annual production of more than 3 million tons of pig iron.

The raw material base for the steel industry is also constantly expanding. In the first four months of this year, more than 20 new large-scale iron ore mines and open-pit mines were completed nationwide. Currently, 30 mining enterprises are under construction. The iron ore mines and open-pit mines that will be put into production in the next seven or eight months will be able to mine a total of more than 17 million tons of iron ore annually.

    苏联大力扩展钢铁工业
    西北的新钢铁中心今年就要出钢
    原有的钢铁工业企业也正在扩大
    新华社莫斯科29日电　苏联正在建设和扩大许多钢铁工业企业。今年用于这方面的基本建设投资要比去年多三十多亿卢布。
    苏联西北部的新钢铁工业中心——列宁格勒附近的切列波维次钢铁厂正在建设中，并且将在今年开始出产第一批钢。在已经投入生产的高炉、炼焦炉、烧结厂和选煤厂旁边，已经建立起了全国最大的平炉车间的金属结构。切列波维次钢铁工厂建成后将同科拉半岛的铁矿基地和彼乔拉煤区结合起来，形成苏联西北部一个巨大的工业三角地带。这个面积有好几个欧洲国家那样大的工业地带，将从根本上解决机器制造业高度发达的苏联整个西北地区的金属供应的问题。
    哈萨克共和国的卡拉干达冶金工厂和乌克兰共和国的克里沃罗格炼钢厂是苏联正在建设的另外两个巨大的新钢铁工业企业。卡拉干达工厂已经在最近开始建设第一个高炉，它的有效容积超过一千五百立方公尺，将是苏联最大的高炉。克里沃罗格炼钢厂现在正在建设贝氏炼钢车间、平炉车间、初轧车间和其他生产部门。在这个企业附近，还在建设一个大型选矿联合工厂，它的设计生产能力是每年八百六十万吨，而且将是全欧洲设备最好的选矿企业。
    原有的钢铁工业企业也在扩大。著名的马格尼托哥尔斯克冶金联合工厂、库兹涅茨克冶金联合工厂等二十个企业，现在正在建设新的轧钢车间、烧结厂和炼焦炉。在顿巴斯的钢铁工业企业中，今年将有五十一项新工业设备投入生产。彼得罗夫斯克工厂、克拉马托尔斯克冶金工厂等钢铁企业将有五个高炉在明年投入生产，它们每年总共可以生产三百多万吨生铁。
    钢铁工业的原料基地也在不断扩大。在今年头四个月中，全国就建成了二十多个新的大型铁矿矿井和露天矿场。目前正在建设的还有三十个采矿企业。将在今后七、八个月内投入生产的铁矿矿井和露天矿场，每年总共可以开采一千七百多万吨铁矿。（附图片）
