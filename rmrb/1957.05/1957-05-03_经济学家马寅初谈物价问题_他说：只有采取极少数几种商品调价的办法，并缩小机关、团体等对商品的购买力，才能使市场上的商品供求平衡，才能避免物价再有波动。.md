    Economist Ma Yinchu Discusses the Price Problem
    He said that only by adopting the method of adjusting the prices of a very few commodities and reducing the purchasing power of government agencies, organizations, etc., can the supply and demand of commodities in the market be balanced, and price fluctuations be avoided.
    Xinhua News Agency, May 2nd:  Our famous economist Ma Yinchu told a Xinhua News Agency reporter regarding the current price issue: The State Council spokesperson's analysis and explanation of this issue is very incisive and clear. I believe that the government's adoption of such price policies and measures is completely correct and necessary, and very appropriate and timely.
    Ma Yinchu said that some people, seeing the recent price adjustments of several commodities, have developed doubts about the country's price policy, which is very inappropriate. Because we are implementing a planned economy, and the most important factor of a planned economy is price stability. It is inconceivable that we can complete the tasks of a planned economy under fluctuating prices. From the State Council spokesperson's statement, we can come to a realization that the government wants to use two methods to achieve the goal of stabilizing prices: first, to balance fiscal revenue and expenditure; second, to balance social purchasing power and commodity sales.
    Then he analyzed this point. He said, regarding the first point, we can take pork and cooking oil as examples. Why is the supply and demand of these two commodities not corresponding? Because in the past, the government's purchase prices were too low, making it unprofitable for farmers, thus reducing production. Therefore, to encourage farmers to increase production, it is necessary to increase purchase prices. However, once the purchase prices are increased, the income of farmers will naturally increase, but the government's expenditure will also inevitably increase, which creates a fiscal revenue and expenditure imbalance. In order to restore the balance of revenue and expenditure, the sales prices of pork and cooking oil are slightly increased to slightly offset the losses on purchase prices, and the shortfall is then made up from the increased revenue from woolen fabrics and high-grade cigarettes. In this way, the balance of fiscal revenue and expenditure can be maintained. Otherwise, we would have to issue public bonds or RMB to make up for the deficit. Although issuing public bonds can recover some floating capital, the principal and interest will have to be repaid in the future, and the government will suffer even greater losses. If RMB is issued, it will cause inflation and greater price fluctuations. Both of these methods are undesirable, so the method of adjusting the prices of a very few commodities is adopted to compensate. Obviously, this is the correct method. Although the price increases for pork and cooking oil will increase some burden on farmers' household expenses, their income still far exceeds their expenditure. Because most of the burden falls on urban residents, and moreover, the price increase of woolen fabrics and high-grade cigarettes, this burden almost entirely falls on consumers with higher purchasing power and lighter burdens, which is not only a small number of people, and the burden does not increase much.
    When talking about the method of balancing social purchasing power and commodity sales to stabilize prices, Ma Yinchu said: After the purchase prices of agricultural products are increased, the purchasing power of farmers will also increase. As a result, the demand for commodities in the market exceeds the supply, and prices will inevitably fluctuate. In order to avoid price fluctuations, we can only reduce the purchasing power of government agencies, organizations, troops, and schools for commodities, so that the supply and demand of commodities in the market can be balanced, and prices will never fluctuate again.
    Ma Yinchu finally said that from the above simple analysis, we can know that the current price changes of several commodities are fundamentally different from the long-term price fluctuations and chaotic phenomena in the old society. He is also preparing to write an article in detail to discuss this issue recently.

    经济学家马寅初谈物价问题
    他说：只有采取极少数几种商品调价的办法，并缩小机关、团体等对商品的购买力，才能使市场上的商品供求平衡，才能避免物价再有波动。
    新华社2日讯  我国著名经济学家马寅初就当前物价问题对新华社记者说：国务院发言人对这个问题分析解释得很精辟、明白，我认为政府采取这种物价政策、措施，完全正确和必要，并且很适当、及时。
    马寅初说，有些人看到最近几种商品调价，于是就对国家的物价政策发生了疑虑，这是很不应该的。因为我们实行的是计划经济，而计划经济的最重要因素是物价的稳定，不可设想在动荡不定的物价之下，我们能完成计划经济的任务。从国务院发言人的谈话中，我们可以得出一个认识，就是政府要用两种方法来达到稳定物价的目的：一、使财政收支平衡；二、使社会购买力与商品销售额平衡。
    接着他就此作了分析。他说，关于第一点，可以拿猪肉与食油为例，为什么这两种商品供求不相应呢？因为过去政府的收购价格偏低，使农民无利可获，因而产量减低。所以，要想鼓励农民增产，就非把收购价格提高不可。但一提高之后，农民的收入固然增加了，而政府的支出也必然加多，这就产生了财政收支不平衡的现象。为了恢复收支平衡，因而就把猪肉、食油的销售价格稍稍提高，略补收购价上的亏损，不足之数再从呢绒和高级纸烟加价中得来的收入补足。这样，财政收支平衡才能维持下去。不然的话，就只有发行公债或人民币来弥补。发行公债虽然可以收回一部分游资，但将来还要还本付息，政府吃亏更大。如果发行人民币，就会造成通货膨胀，物价波动更大。这两种办法均不足取，所以才采取了极少数几种商品调价的办法来弥补。显然，这是正确的办法。虽然猪肉和食油加价，农民的家庭开支会增加一些负担，但他们的收入仍远远超过他们的支出。因为大部分的负担落在城市居民身上，而何况呢绒与高级纸烟的涨价，这种负担，又差不多全部落在购买力较高，负担较轻的消费者身上，这不但是少数人，并且负担也并不增加多少。
    当谈到使社会购买力和商品销售额平衡的办法稳定物价时，马寅初说：农产品的收购价格提高后，农民的购买力也就增加了。结果对于市场商品求过于供，物价势必波动。为了避免物价波动，就只有把政府各机关、团体、部队和学校对商品的购买力缩小，这样，市场上的商品才能供求平衡，物价决不会再有波动。
    马寅初最后说，从上面的简单分析，可以知道当前几种商品的价格变动，和旧社会长期所有物价波动混乱的现象有着根本的不同。他最近还准备写文章详细谈论这个问题。
