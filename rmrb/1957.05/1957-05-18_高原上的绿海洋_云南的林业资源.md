The Green Ocean on the Plateau
--Yunnan's Forestry Resources

Yunnan is a forest treasure house of the motherland, with 7.8 million hectares of forest area. Its timber reserves are second only to those of the Northeast. The accumulation of forest trees in the northwestern Yunnan forest area alone reaches 160 million cubic meters. In those original forests, the towering Yunnan pines, spruces, and firs are generally too thick to embrace. Comrades from the forest survey team once calculated that one of the spruces had a diameter of seven feet two inches (Chinese foot) at breast height and was more than 15 zhang tall. If this tree were used to build a mixed-structure house, it would be enough to build more than 700 square meters. The subtropical forest area in the Honghe River basin and the lower reaches of the Lancang River presents a different picture. In the original forests there, the branches of large trees intertwine, and people often cannot stand upright when walking through the forest. There are no severe winters here, and the rainfall is abundant, so the trees grow very quickly. Oil chestnut trees can mature in just eight years.

Yunnan's forests are not only vast in area, but also rich in tree species. According to incomplete statistics, there are a total of 2,700 species in 84 families, with trees from the tropical, temperate, and cold zones all represented. In addition to common trees such as pine, fir, and chestnut, there are also the Jianbai and Bald Cypress, which do not decay for hundreds of years, the Dragon Brain tree, which is used to extract borneol, the oak tree, which produces cork, the rubber tree and lacquer tree, which have significant industrial uses, and the high-quality rosewood and teak. There is also the large dragon bamboo, which is so thick that it can be used to make buckets.

Yunnan Province has broad prospects for forestry. Not only does it have abundant mature timber, but also nearly twice the area of existing forests in barren mountains available for afforestation. The natural conditions here are also uniquely favorable, with short winters or even no winter at all, and sufficient rainfall. Trees that take 30 years to mature elsewhere can grow to maturity in 20 years here. In the past few years, people of all ethnic groups in Yunnan have made great efforts in afforestation. The afforestation task of the first five-year plan has now been overfulfilled by nearly 100%. Everyone is working hard to complete the ten-year greening task ahead of schedule. According to the plan, ten years later, the total output value of Yunnan's forest industry will be equal to the total industrial and agricultural output value of the province last year.

    高原上的绿海洋
    ——云南的林业资源
    云南是祖国的一个森林宝库，有七百八十多万公顷的林区，木材的蕴藏量仅次于东北。光是滇西北一个林区，林木的蓄积量就达一亿六千万立方公尺。在那一片片的原始森林里，参天耸立的云南松、云杉、冷杉，一般都抱不过来。森林调查队的同志曾经计算过其中的一棵云杉，它的胸高直径达到七尺二寸（市尺），有十五丈多高，如果用这棵树来建造混合结构的房屋，足够造七百多平方公尺。在红河流域和澜沧江下流的亚热带林区，则是另一种情形。那里的原始森林里，大树枝丫交着枝丫，人在森林里行走，常常直不起身子来。这里没有严冬，雨量充沛，树木生长非常迅速，油加栗树只要八年就可成材。
    云南森林不只面积广大，林木种类也多。据不完全的统计，共有八十四科二千七百多种，热、温、寒三带的林木都有。在这里除了常见的松、杉、栗等树种以外，还生长着几百年不腐的建柏、秃杉，提炼冰片用的龙脑树，产软木的栎树，在工业上有重大用途的橡胶树、漆树，木质优良的紫檀、柚木、……，还有粗大得可以做斗做水桶的大龙竹。
    云南省的林业有广阔的前途。它不但有丰富的已经成材的林木，还有将近现有森林面积两倍大的荒山可供造林。而这里的自然条件又是得天独厚，冬季很短甚至没有冬天，雨量充足。在别处要三十年才能成材的树木，在这里生长二十年就行了。几年来，云南各族人民在造林方面作了很大的努力，第一个五年计划的造林任务现在已经超额近一倍。大家正在为提前完成十年的绿化任务而努力。依照规划，十年以后，云南森林工业的总产值将和去年全省工农业总产值相等。
