    At a recent symposium held by the Party Group of the First Ministry of Machine Building, intellectuals and engineering and technical personnel from democratic parties leveled sharp criticisms against the sectarianism of the Party organizations and some Party members.

    Some people mentioned that in the First Ministry of Machine Building system, there is a situation where the Party and government are not separated, and non-Party leading cadres have positions and responsibilities but no power. Non-Party leading cadres cannot participate in discussions of the ministry's policies and cannot see documents necessary for their work. In one enterprise, the head of the technical inspection section, because he is not a Party member, could not even see the central government's telegrams on quality issues. The Industrial Education Department of the ministry is engaged in personnel-related work and ideological work, but instructions related to ideological work generally come down through the Party system. After the instructions are issued, the non-Party leading cadres in the department are still in the dark. Because they do not understand the situation, when lower-level cadres ask for instructions, they can only act like clay idols, timid and afraid to make decisions. One engineer said that all major issues are decided by the Party organization, and non-Party masses have no opportunity to express their opinions; after the Party organization has made a decision on many things, it is useless for non-Party cadres to offer opinions; young cadres who join the Party can participate in the discussion of major issues in their units, while experienced non-Party responsible cadres cannot express their opinions.

    Some engineering and technical personnel who participate in democratic parties pointed out that the Party organization of the First Ministry of Machine Building neither consults with the democratic party organizations on many major issues nor absorbs members of the democratic party organizations to participate in discussions. The Party organization adopts an attitude of indifference towards the democratic party organizations.

    When talking about the issue of promoting and cultivating cadres, some people believe that sectarianism is even more serious in the First Ministry of Machine Building system on this issue. One Party member cadre who graduated from a secondary technical school was promoted to the position of chief engineer of an enterprise, while some non-Party technical personnel with higher technical levels were not promoted. In some enterprises, the section chiefs are more capable than the factory director, but because they are non-Party cadres, they cannot be promoted to factory director. In some units, some non-Party members were clerks and section chiefs several years ago, and they are still clerks and section chiefs now, while the clerks and section chiefs who joined the Party at that time are now either section chiefs or division chiefs. The selection of students to study abroad also places too much emphasis on political conditions and neglects professional level.

    Some people believe that the Party organization of the First Ministry of Machine Building provides a lot of care for the material life of non-Party engineering and technical personnel, and even in some places the care is excessive, causing some intellectuals to become divorced from the masses. However, they do not pay enough attention to the political progress and technical progress of intellectuals, which is precisely what intellectuals care about most. In some units, non-Party cadres who make mistakes are simply dismissed, and they are rarely given political education in peacetime. One engineer requested to join the Party, but the Party organization did not talk to him even once for more than a year, leaving him baffled.

### 第一机械部非党工程技术人员座谈  严厉批评党组织的宗派主义

    第一机械部非党工程技术人员座谈
    严厉批评党组织的宗派主义
    本报特约新华社专稿　在第一机械工业部党组最近召开的座谈会上，民主党派的知识分子和工程技术人员对党组织和有些党员的宗派主义提出了尖锐的批评。
    有的人提到，在第一机械工业部系统存在着党政不分的情况，非党领导干部有职有责而无权。非党领导干部不能参加讨论部里的方针政策，看不到工作必需的文件。有的企业的技术检查科长因为是非党员，连中央发出的关于质量问题的电报都看不到。部里的工教司是人事性的工作，思想工作较多，但有关思想工作的指示，一般都是通过党系统下来的，指示发出了，司里的非党领导干部还蒙在鼓里。由于不了解情况，下边干部请示工作的时候，只能像个泥菩萨，畏畏缩缩，不敢决定。一位工程师说，一切重大问题都由党组织决定，党外群众没有机会发表意见；好多事情等到党组织决定以后，非党干部再提意见也不顶事；入党的青年干部可以参加本单位重大问题的讨论，而有经验的非党负责干部反倒不能发表意见。
    有些参加民主党派的工程技术人员提出，第一机械工业部的党组织，对许多重大问题既不和民主党派组织协商，也不吸收民主党派组织成员参加讨论。党组织对民主党派组织采取不闻不问的态度。
    谈到提拔、培养干部的问题的时候，有的人认为第一机械工业部系统在这个问题上宗派主义更严重。有一个党员干部是中等技术学校毕业的，却提拔为企业总工程师，有些非党技术人员技术水平比他高，却不提拔。有些企业的科长业务能力比厂长强，因为是非党干部，也不能提拔为厂长。有的单位一些非党员几年前是科员、科长，现在还是科员、科长，而当时入党的科员、科长，现在有的当了科长，有的当了处长。派留学生，也是过于偏重政治条件，忽视业务水平。
    有的人认为第一机械工业部党组织对非党工程技术人员的物质生活照顾很多，甚至有些地方照顾过火，使有些知识分子脱离群众。但是对知识分子的政治进步和技术进步却关心不够，而这恰恰是知识分子最关心的。有的单位非党干部犯了错误，以开除了事，而平时很少对他们进行政治教育。有一位工程师提出入党要求，党组织一年多也没找他谈一次话，弄得他莫名其妙。
