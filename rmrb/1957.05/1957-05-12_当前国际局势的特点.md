The difficulty for the American ruling clique in trying to hinder the trend of international detente is growing, and this is the characteristic of the current international situation. After the failure of the imperialist armed intervention in Egypt and the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Hungary, peace-loving countries of the world have continuously strived to ease international tensions and improve international relations. At the same time, the desire for peace among the people of all countries, including broad sections of the people in imperialist countries, has also increased. However, the international reactionary forces, led by the United States, are trying every possible means to create tensions in order to continue to pursue their policies of arms expansion, war preparation, aggression, and expansion.

Currently, the struggle between the two policies of striving for further detente in the international situation and creating tensions is being carried out fiercely.

	The Trend Towards Detente

The trend of the international situation continuing to move towards detente is reflected in many aspects.

First, the solidarity between socialist countries is constantly strengthening. Mutual visits and talks between delegations from the parties and governments of various socialist countries have further strengthened the fraternal friendship and mutual assistance and cooperation between the countries. The visit of Soviet leader Voroshilov to our country is an even greater climax of the great unity of the socialist camp countries. The consolidation and development of the cooperative relationship of unity between socialist countries is a reliable guarantee of world peace.

While strengthening the unity between socialist countries, the Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries are also actively striving to improve international relations and ease international tensions. Chairman Voroshilov has traveled from our country to visit Indonesia; Chairman Bulganin wrote a letter to British Prime Minister Macmillan on April 20, putting forward positive suggestions for solving the disarmament issue, the European security issue, and improving Soviet-British relations; at the meeting of the Subcommittee of the United Nations Disarmament Commission, the Soviet representative recently put forward a new disarmament proposal that includes the expansion of the scope of aerial inspection that the Western countries have insisted on. During this period, our country also continued to take positive steps for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan and received the delegation of the Japanese Socialist Party that came to our country to promote Sino-Japanese relations. These actions by the Soviet Union and China have greatly changed the international atmosphere and filled the people of all countries with good hope for the development prospects of the international situation.

Second, due to the firm implementation of the policy of defending national independence and strengthening the unity of Arab countries by Egypt, Syria, and other Arab countries, the situation in the Middle East, which was once the center of the international storm, has gradually eased. Recently, the United States created tension and unrest in Jordan, but the Suez Canal has resumed navigation, and the imperialist countries have had to abandon their unreasonable boycott of the canal and accept Egypt's management of this waterway. This is an important turning point in the Middle East situation.

In addition, another extremely important development in the current international situation is that the voices of the people of all countries demanding a halt to hydrogen bomb testing and opposing the nuclear arms race are becoming more and more widespread. The call issued by the World Peace Council for this purpose has been widely echoed by peace-loving people of all countries. Now, not only the governments of some Asian countries, but also many political parties and prominent public leaders in Western European countries, as well as some political leaders in the United States, have been involved in this movement. This is a large-scale movement by the people of all countries to strive for peace, and it is a strong pressure on the imperialist policy of expanding atomic armaments.

Finally, it should also be seen that many Western European countries can no longer endure the heavy military expenditures. Britain and France have successively reduced their military spending; Britain has also decided to reduce the number of armed forces by 375,000 in the next five years. At the same time, countries such as Britain, Japan, France, and West Germany have expressed increasing dissatisfaction with the US embargo policy and demanded a change in this policy. The above situation, in addition to the adverse impact of Britain's emphasis on the development of nuclear weapons, also reflects the desire of these countries to improve their economic conditions and develop East-West economic exchanges, which has a positive effect on improving international relations.

	The United States Creates New Tensions

The desire of the people of all countries for peace and improvement of international relations is contrary to the desire of the US ruling clique for aggression and expansion. Therefore, every effort by the people of all countries and peace-loving countries to ease the international situation will make the US ruling clique feel uneasy and will be resisted by the United States as much as possible.

The most important desire of the people of all countries at present is to avoid the threat of nuclear war. However, the United States is intensifying its expansion of atomic armaments and creating the threat of atomic war. The United States not only insisted on equipping the armies of Western European countries with atomic weapons at the recent North Atlantic Group Council meeting, but also openly dispatched US missile units to Taiwan, our country's territory, after that meeting. Since then, the United States has expanded its policy of expanding atomic armaments to Asia and the Far East. The purpose of the United States in doing so is to create a tense atmosphere and complicate the international situation.

While creating tensions in Europe and the Far East, the United States is also stepping up the implementation of its Eisenhower Doctrine in the Middle East, which aims to invade Arab countries and squeeze out Britain and France. During this period, in addition to the Richards mission continuing to operate in many countries in the Middle East and North Africa, the United States also openly dispatched the Sixth Fleet to carry out armed intervention in the situation in Jordan, and the US Marines even landed in Lebanon to "show force." This once made the situation in the Middle East very tense. After this, the United States announced that it would give Jordan $10 million in aid. The United States' practice of using military threats and dollar inducements to extend its power in the Middle East clearly exposes that the Eisenhower Doctrine is even more poisonous than the old imperialist gunboat policy towards colonial peoples.

In order to obstruct the improvement of international relations and the trend of the international situation towards detente, at the Bonn Conference of the North Atlantic Group, on the one hand, it colluded with West German militarism to desperately spread anti-Soviet smoke and drive other countries of the North Atlantic Group to accept the US arms race policy. On the other hand, the United States attacked Britain's new defense policy in order to force Britain to change its decision to reduce the number of armed forces. Not only that, but after the Bonn Conference, the United States used the contradictions between West Germany and other Western European countries and Britain to continue to exert pressure on Britain in the talks between Macmillan and Adenauer and at the meeting of the Western European Union Assembly. The Western European Union Assembly also passed a resolution opposing the reduction of so-called allied ground forces on the European continent, which was obviously aimed at Britain.

Under pressure from all sides, the United States expressed its willingness to consider the Soviet Union's new disarmament proposal and stated its willingness to discuss the issue of easing the embargo that countries have requested. However, in the disarmament negotiations, the United States still refuses to undertake obligations to prohibit the use of nuclear weapons; and according to information revealed by Western countries, the so-called new list of goods for easing the embargo proposed by the United States actually strengthens the embargo control. Therefore, the US policy of expanding atomic armaments and continuing to create tensions cannot be concealed.

	Unpopular Policy

The US policy of promoting the expansion of atomic armaments and creating tensions has aroused increasingly firm opposition from the people of all countries and has continued to deepen its contradictions with Britain, France, and other countries.

The movement of the people of all countries demanding a halt to the atomic arms race and a halt to nuclear testing is continuing to develop. In particular, the movement of the people of Western European countries against equipping the forces of Western European countries with atomic weapons is being widely carried out. In West Germany, powerful social forces, including the two main opposition parties, the Social Democratic Party and the Free Democratic Party, have been involved in this movement, making this issue the focus of the upcoming West German general election struggle. This situation has forced the United States and the West German government, which are eager to equip the West German army with atomic weapons, to postpone their plans at the North Atlantic Group Council meeting until after the September general election. The US action of setting up missiles in Taiwan, our country, has not only aroused the indignation of our people, but also aroused opposition from public opinion in many Asian countries.

The people of the Middle East countries, who are in the upsurge of the anti-colonialist struggle, will not be intimidated by the US armed intervention in the situation in Jordan. Egypt, Syria, and other countries still firmly reject the Eisenhower Doctrine. Although the nationalist forces in Jordan have suffered setbacks, their struggle against colonialism has not ceased. The victory of the Syrian left-wing parties in the by-elections for parliamentarians shows the powerful strength of the anti-colonialist struggle of the Middle East people. The struggle of the Middle East people against the Eisenhower Doctrine will inevitably continue to move forward.

The United States' unbridled actions in the Middle East and its practice of squeezing out Britain and France have also been publicly criticized by important figures in the British ruling clique, such as former Prime Minister Churchill. Churchill said that the United States should "reconsider" Britain's "opinion" in the Middle East. This shows that with the implementation of the Eisenhower Doctrine, the contradictions between the United States and Britain and France are also continuing to deepen.

At the same time, the United States has also encountered difficulties in its efforts to maintain the plan of the North Atlantic Group countries to expand armaments and prepare for war. In particular, Britain's decision to reduce its armed forces has caused a series of contradictions among the countries of the North Atlantic Group. The United States and West Germany have formed a new axis in the North Atlantic Group to exert pressure on Britain, but Britain has refused to yield on its defense policy. This conflicting contradiction between the countries of the North Atlantic Group is also reflected in the struggle over the embargo issue. Britain and some other countries are very resentful of the US attempt to continue to tighten the implementation of the embargo policy under the name of easing the embargo. The United Press International said that if the United States insists on this practice, it will make the so-called Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls in Paris "virtually equivalent to disintegration." This situation shows how unpopular the US policy of creating tensions is.

The policies of the United States have been opposed by the people of all countries, while the efforts of the Soviet Union and all other peace-loving countries to strive for peace have been widely welcomed by the people of all countries. Public opinion in all countries urgently hopes that through the efforts of all countries, relations between the East and the West can be improved, that disarmament negotiations can reach an agreement, and that the international situation can continue to move towards detente. This is the common desire of the people of all countries, but to realize this desire, the people of all countries still need to carry out great struggles to overcome the obstacles erected by the United States on this road.

    当前国际局势的特点
                顾思
    美国统治集团力图阻挠国际局势走向缓和的困难已愈来愈大，这是当前国际局势的特点。在帝国主义武装干涉埃及和在匈牙利制造反革命的叛乱失败之后，世界爱好和平的国家曾不断地为缓和国际紧张局势和改善国际关系而努力，同时各国人民，包括帝国主义国家的广泛阶层人士要求和平的愿望也日益增长。但是，以美国为首的国际反动势力，却千方百计地制造紧张局势，以便继续推行其扩军备战和侵略扩张的政策。
    目前，争取国际局势的进一步和缓和制造紧张局势这两种政策的斗争，正在激烈进行。
            走向缓和的趋势
    国际局势继续走向和缓的趋势，表现在许多方面。
    首先，社会主义国家之间的团结在不断增强。各社会主义国家的党和政府代表团的相互访问和会谈，已进一步加强了各国之间的兄弟友谊和互助合作关系。苏联元首伏罗希洛夫对我国的访问，更是社会主义阵营国家伟大团结的一个高潮。社会主义国家团结合作关系的巩固和发展，是世界和平的可靠保证。
    在加强社会主义国家之间团结的同时，苏联、中国与其他社会主义国家，也积极为改善国际关系和缓和国际局势而努力。伏罗希洛夫主席已从我国到印度尼西亚访问；布尔加宁主席于4月20日写信给英国首相麦克米伦，对解决裁军问题、欧洲安全问题和改善苏英关系，提出了积极的建议；在联合国裁军委员会小组委员会的会议上，苏联代表最近又提出了一项包含西方国家所坚持的扩大空中视察范围的裁军新建议。在这个期间，我国也为和平解放台湾继续采取了积极步骤，并接待了为促进中日关系而来我国访问的日本社会党代表团。苏中两国的这些行动，大大转变了国际气氛，使各国人民对国际局势的发展前途怀着良好的希望。
    其次，由于埃及、叙利亚等阿拉伯国家坚定地执行了保卫民族独立和加强阿拉伯国家团结的政策，一度成为国际风暴中心的中东局势，已逐渐缓和下来。最近美国在约旦制造了紧张和不安，但是，苏伊士运河恢复航行了，帝国主义国家已不能不放弃对运河的无理抵制，接受埃及对这条水道的管理。这是中东局势的一个重要的转折。
    此外，当前国际局势中的另一个极其重要的发展，就是各国人民要求停止氢弹爆炸试验和反对核子军备竞赛的呼声越来越普遍了。世界和平理事会为此发出的呼吁，已得到各国爱好和平人民的广泛响应。现在，已不仅是一些亚洲国家的政府，并且许多西欧国家的政党、著名的公众领袖以及美国的一些政治领袖，都卷入了这个运动。这是各国人民争取和平的一个声势浩大的运动，它对帝国主义的扩张原子军备政策是一个强大的压力。
    最后，还应该看到，许多西欧国家对沉重的军费已不堪忍受了。英国和法国已相继削减了它们的军费开支；英国并决定在今后五年内把武装部队人数裁减三十七万五千人。同时，英国、日本、法国和西德等国家，对美国的禁运政策表现了越来越大的不满，并要求改变这种政策。上述的情况，除了英国强调发展核武器的不良影响之外，还表现了这些国家希望改善它们的经济状况和发展东西方经济交流的愿望，这对于改善国际关系具有积极的作用。
            美国制造新的紧张
    各国人民要求和平和改善国际关系的愿望，是同美国统治集团侵略扩张的欲望相矛盾的。因而，各国人民和爱好和平国家缓和国际局势的每一个努力，都会使美国统治集团感到不安，都遭受到美国的竭力抵抗。
    当前各国人民最主要的愿望就是要避免核子战争的威胁。但是，美国却在变本加厉地扩张原子军备，制造原子战争的威胁。美国不仅最近在北大西洋集团理事会上坚持要以原子武器装备西欧国家的军队，而且在那个会议之后，公然把美国的导弹部队派驻在我国的领土台湾。从此，美国已把它扩张原子军备的政策扩展到亚洲和远东地区来了。美国这样做的目的，是要制造紧张空气，使国际局势趋于复杂化。
    美国在欧洲和远东制造紧张局势的同时，还在中东加紧推行其侵略阿拉伯国家和排挤英法的艾森豪威尔主义。在这个期间，除了理查兹使团继续在中东和北非许多国家进行活动之外，美国还公然派遣了第六舰队对约旦局势进行武装干涉，美国的海军陆战队甚至在黎巴嫩登陆以“显示力量”。这使中东局势曾一度剑拔弩张。在此以后，美国又宣布给约旦一千万美元的援助。美国以武力威胁和美元诱骗的手段在中东伸张势力的做法，清楚地暴露了艾森豪威尔主义比旧日帝国主义对付殖民地人民的炮舰政策还要恶毒。
    为了阻挠国际关系的改善和国际局势的走向缓和，美国在北大西洋集团的波恩会议上，一方面同西德军国主义勾结一起，拼命散布反苏烟幕，驱使北大西洋集团其他国家接受美国的军备竞赛政策，另一方面，美国对英国的新的国防政策进行攻击，以便迫使英国改变它裁减武装部队人数的决定。不仅如此，在波恩会议之后，美国并利用西德以及其他西欧国家同英国的矛盾，在麦克米伦与阿登纳的会谈中，以及在西欧联盟议会的会议上，继续对英国施加压力。西欧联盟议会并通过决议，反对裁减在欧洲大陆上的所谓盟国地面部队，这显然是针对着英国的。
    美国在各方面的压力下，表示愿意考虑苏联的裁军新建议，并声明愿意讨论各国要求放宽禁运的问题。但是，在裁军谈判中，美国至今仍拒绝对禁止使用核子武器承担义务；并且根据西方国家所透露的消息，美国所提出的所谓放宽禁运的新货单，实际上是加强了禁运管制。因此，美国的扩张原子军备和继续制造紧张局势的政策是掩饰不住的。
            不得人心的政策
    美国推行的扩张原子军备和制造紧张局势的政策，已经引起了各国人民的日益坚决的反对，并使它和英法等国的矛盾继续加深。
    各国人民要求停止原子军备竞赛和停止核子爆炸试验的运动，在继续发展中。特别是西欧国家人民反对以原子武器装备西欧国家部队的运动，正在广泛地开展。在西德，包括社会民主党和自由民主党两个主要反对党派在内的强大的社会力量卷入了这个运动，从而使这个问题成为西德未来大选斗争的中心问题。这种情况使得亟于想以原子武器装备西德军队的美国和西德政府，在北大西洋集团理事会会议上不得不把它们的计划推迟到9月大选以后去实施。美国在我国台湾设置导弹的行动，不但激起了我国人民的愤慨，而且引起了许多亚洲国家舆论的反对。
    处在反殖民主义斗争的高潮中的中东各国人民，是不会被美国对约旦局势的武装干涉所吓倒的。埃及、叙利亚等国仍坚决拒绝艾森豪威尔主义。约旦民族主义力量虽受到了挫折，但是它们反对殖民主义的斗争并没有中止。叙利亚左翼党派在议员补缺选举中所取得的胜利，说明了中东人民反殖民主义斗争的强大力量。中东人民反对艾森豪威尔主义的斗争，必然将继续向前发展。
    美国在中东横行无忌和排挤英法的做法，也受到英国统治集团的重要人物、前首相丘吉尔的公开抨击。丘吉尔表示美国在中东应该“重新考虑”英国的“意见”了。这说明，随着艾森豪威尔主义的推行，美国同英法之间的矛盾也在继续加深。
    同时，美国在努力维持北大西洋集团国家扩军备战的计划上，也遇到了困难。特别是英国裁减武装部队的决定，引起了北大西洋集团国家之间一连串的矛盾。美国与西德在北大西洋集团中结成了一个新的轴心来对英国施加压力，但是英国在它的国防政策上一直不肯退让。北大西洋集团国家这种利害冲突的矛盾，也表现在禁运问题的斗争上。英国和其他一些国家，对美国企图借放宽禁运之名而继续加紧实施禁运政策的做法，有很大的反感。美国合众社说，美国如果坚持这种做法，将会使巴黎的所谓对华贸易管制委员会“实际上等于解体”。这种情况说明，美国制造紧张局势的政策是如何地不得人心了。
    美国的政策遭到各国人民的反对，而苏联和所有其他爱好和平国家争取和平的努力，却受到了各国人民的广泛欢迎。各国舆论迫切地希望通过各国的努力能使东西方的关系得到改善，使裁军谈判能够达成协议，使国际局势能继续走向缓和。这是各国人民的共同愿望，但是要实现这种愿望，还需要各国人民进行巨大的斗争，来克服美国横阻在这条道路上的障碍。
