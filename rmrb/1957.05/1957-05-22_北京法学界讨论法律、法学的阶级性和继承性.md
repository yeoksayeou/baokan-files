Academic Trends

    The China Political Science and Law Society organized an academic discussion on the class nature and inheritance of law and legal science. Since March, three general discussion meetings and three group discussion meetings have been held, and they have now basically come to an end.

    More than 60 jurists from Beijing's political and law colleges and universities and political and legal organs participated in the discussion. More than 20 people spoke in the three general discussion meetings.

    Different Understandings of the Concept of "Inheritance"

    Most people believe that inheritance is not a complete and unchanged application, but rather a "transformation, selection, and critical acceptance." However, there are still different understandings of the meaning of the concept of "inheritance." For example, Li Zuyin believes: "The meaning of inheritance can be broad or narrow: the broad sense is to inherit everything, good or bad, without distinction, as an object of research and criticism; the narrow sense of inheritance is not complete inheritance, but inheritance with selection, changes, or supplements." Li Qi said: "Inheritance is the connection of historical development, which includes affirmation and negation." Shen Zongling raised different opinions on the above two views, and he believes that the concept of inheritance should not be understood in an inappropriately expanded way. He also said: Regarding the relationship between the law of the proletariat and the law of the exploiting classes, "When we say 'inheritance,' it refers to critically absorbing certain factors on the basis of fundamental negation. That is, negation includes inheritance, not inheritance includes affirmation and negation." Wu Chuanyi said: "Some people directly or indirectly advocate that the inheritance of law is largely a complete and unchanged application. This kind of situation is extremely rare and is limited to different eras of the same type of society. Others believe that inheritance is the new law referring to the old law or gaining some inspiration from the old law. For example, some people argue that we found the proposition 'the sacred and inviolable nature of public ownership' from the principle of the Napoleonic Code of 'the sacred and inviolable nature of private property.' In fact, this proposition is the legal result of the change from private ownership of the means of production to public ownership." He also said: "According to some people, in the field of law, using the methods of the ruling class to deal with the ruling class is also a kind of inheritance. If this statement is implemented, then it will inevitably lead to the conclusion that the Regulations on the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries inherited Chiang Kai-shek's 'Emergency Law for the Punishment of Those Endangering the Republic of China.' This view not only has all the shortcomings of heuristicism, but also blurs all the boundaries between the old and new laws."

    Different understandings of the concept of inheritance are one of the reasons for the differences in understanding the issue of the inheritance of law.

    Is there any Inheritance between the New and Old Laws?

    The relatively consistent opinion in the discussion is that there is undoubtedly inheritance between laws of the exploiting class type. Therefore, the debate focused on whether there is any inheritance between socialist-type law and exploiting-class-type law.

    Pang Jinqing said: "Theoretically speaking, law has inheritance. Denying inheritance is equal to denying history. In practice, based on my personal experience in legal work for the past seven years, some things can be critically absorbed, transformed, and utilized." Zeng Bingjun said: "Social life cannot be cut off. No matter which class is in power, today's social relations and yesterday's social relations will not be completely different. Although the system is different in marriage, there is always a marital relationship. As long as this fact exists, the old law provides a lot of material that can be critically absorbed."

    Rui Mu believes: "As the will of the ruling class, law cannot be inherited between hostile classes. However, as a cultural and knowledge phenomenon and a part of cultural heritage, it can be considered for acceptance." Some people believe that dividing law into the will of the ruling class and a cultural phenomenon is not necessarily appropriate.

    A debate also unfolded on whether there is inheritance between the old and new laws in our country. Zhang Xin said: "Saying that there is inheritance between the old and new laws in our country is inconsistent with the fact that the 'Six Codes' were abolished and the spirit of the judicial reform movement." He believes: "Having inheritance does not mean that every country must inherit. Our country has no inheritance from the old law because: (1) The laws of the Kuomintang were extremely reactionary; (2) The legal system developed in our base areas can meet the needs of the early days of the founding of the country." Sun Guohua disagreed with this opinion, believing: "We cannot simply look at whether there is inheritance between the old and new laws from the two forms of creating norms—formulation and recognition. Recognition of the old legal norms is certainly a manifestation of inheritance, and even when formulating norms, we cannot say that the legislator is not influenced by the old legal forms."

    Many people mentioned that the "Six Codes" of the Kuomintang government were extremely reactionary and were pieced together by copying the laws of capitalist countries and the feudal period in China. It was completely correct to abolish them completely. Some people mentioned that abolishing the old law does not contradict the inheritance of law and is suitable for China's situation.

    The Relationship between the Class Nature and Inheritance of Law

    Regarding the relationship between the class nature and inheritance of law, the relatively consistent understanding is that the two are not absolutely mutually exclusive. Zhang Yingnan said: "Law has a class nature and also has inheritance. The class nature of law does not exclude inheritance." Wang Min also believes: "Emphasizing the class nature of law and denying the inheritance of law is one-sided. Emphasizing the inheritance of law and obliterating the class nature of law is a supra-class viewpoint."

    There were some debates on how to understand the particularity of law in social ideology. Li Qi said: "Some people have excessively emphasized the particularity of law. Law has a class nature, and the law of a certain period reflects the will of the ruling class of that period. It is wrong to deny this point. However, excessively emphasizing the class nature of law, detaching it from the general laws of social, cultural, and ideological development, and separating the particular from the general is also wrong." Shen Zongling believes: "The old law, as a cultural phenomenon, cannot be detached from the general laws of social, cultural, and ideological development due to the particularity of law. However, I also believe that the particularity of law should be fully emphasized. The following two points should be considered: First, law is both a rule of conduct guaranteed by the state's coercive force as the will of the ruling class, and it is also a cultural phenomenon. When we talk about inheritance here, the object is not the law as the rule of conduct guaranteed by the state's coercive force, but the law as a cultural phenomenon or cultural heritage. Second, the class nature of law is stronger than other cultural phenomena."

    In the discussion, some speeches also mentioned that in the Soviet Union, the first decree on the court in November 1917 and the second decree on the court in March 1918 stipulated, according to the specific historical circumstances at the time, that in the trial of civil cases, the old laws that had not been abolished and did not contradict socialist legal consciousness could be used. In Poland and East Germany, some pre-revolutionary codes that had been supplemented and revised were also used. Some people believe that this is a factual manifestation of the class nature and inheritance of law. However, some people believe that this is just a different specific form of abolishing the old law.

    In the discussion, everyone felt that the relationship between the class nature and inheritance of law is a very complex issue that requires specific research and analysis.

    What to Inherit?

    Regarding the question of what to inherit, Chen Shengqing said: "The new law also contains positive elements from the old law, such as (1) Things that are common in the old and new legal phenomena, such as blood relatives, relatives by marriage, and methods of calculating degrees of kinship arising from parents, children, and spouses. (2) The slogans of democracy, freedom, and equality put forward during the bourgeois revolution have popular nature. Our democracy has absorbed some positive things from bourgeois democracy and has developed into the highest type of democracy." Cheng Xiaohe believes that the things that should be inherited are: "(1) There are some democratic and progressive factors in some old laws. (2) Some ideological materials in the old law can be critically absorbed to serve the new law. (3) Some concepts, reasoning, and judgments in the old law are the accumulated experience of past long-term legal work, which contains more or less scientific components and can be critically absorbed."

    Regarding the specific content that should be inherited, Li Haopei believes: "Taking the Napoleonic Code as an example, it has three basic principles: (1) Freedom of contract and the principle that contracts must be fulfilled. This is beneficial to the bourgeoisie. But as far as the point that contracts must be fulfilled is concerned, the Soviet Union has already inherited it. (2) The principle that private property is sacred. This is reactionary. But with private removed, the concept of ownership, the principle of the sacredness of property, can be inherited under socialist public ownership. (3) The principle of equal civil rights for citizens. This is used by the bourgeoisie to deceive the people. But equality is also wanted by the proletariat." Some speeches believed that it was incorrect to excessively expand the concept of inheritance.

    Is it inheriting the form or the content of the old law? Some people believe that the content of the law is the so-called "class content," so it is only possible to inherit the formal aspects of the law. However, other opinions believe that form and content cannot be separated, and there is inheritance in both content and form between the old and new laws. In the debate, it was reflected that there were also different understandings of the concept of the form of law.

### 北京法学界讨论法律、法学的阶级性和继承性

    北京法学界讨论法律、法学的阶级性和继承性
    中国政治法律学会曾就法律、法律科学的阶级性和继承性问题组织了学术讨论会。自3月份以来，举行了三次大会讨论，又组织了三个分组会的讨论，目前已基本上告一段落。
    参加这次讨论的有北京各政法院校和政法机关的法学家共六十余人。在三次大会讨论中，先后发言的有二十余人。
    对“继承”的概念有不同的理解
    多数人认为：所谓继承，不是原封不动地搬用，而是“经过了改造、选择，有批判地接受”。但对“继承”这一概念的含义，在具体理解上还是有所不同的。如李祖荫认为：“继承的意义，有广有狭：广义是不加分别，好的坏的全部继承，作为研究批判的对象；狭义的继承，不是全部继承，而是加以选择、变更或补充的继承。”李琪说：“继承是历史发展的联系，其中包括了肯定也包括了否定。”沈宗灵对以上两种看法提出了不同的意见，他认为不能把继承这一概念作不适当的扩大的了解。并说：对于无产阶级的法与剥削阶级的法之间的关系来讲，“我们说‘继承’是指在根本否定的基础上批判地吸收，也就是继承其中某些因素。是否定包括了继承，不是继承包括了肯定与否定。”吴传颐说：“有某些人直接或间接地主张法的继承就是大体上原封不动的搬套。这类情形是极少的，而且只限于同一类型社会的不同时代。另一些人以为继承就是新法参考旧法或者从旧法中获得某种启发。例如有人主张我们是从‘私有制神圣不可侵犯’的拿破仑法典的原则中，找到了‘公有制神圣不可侵犯’的命题。其实这一命题是生产资料私有制变更为公有制的法律结果。”他又说：“据某些人看来，在法的领域中，以统治阶级之道还治统治阶级之身，这也是一种继承。如果贯彻这一说法，那么必然要得出这样的结论：镇压反革命条例继承了蒋介石的‘危害民国紧急治罪法’。这一看法不仅具有启发论的一切缺点，同时还模糊了新旧法的一切界线。”
    对于继承的概念有不同的理解，这是使法的继承性问题认识分歧的原因之一。
    新旧法之间有没有继承性？
    讨论中比较一致的意见，认为在剥削阶级类型的法之间，无疑是有继承性的。因此，争论集中在社会主义类型的法与剥削阶级类型的法之间有没有继承性的问题上。
    庞荩青说：“从理论上讲，法有继承性。否认继承等于否认历史。在实际方面，依个人参加法制工作七年来的体会，有些东西是可以批判地吸收而加以改造利用的。”曾炳钧说：“社会生活是不能斩断的，不论那一个阶级当政，今天的社会关系和昨天的社会关系不会完全两样。婚姻中尽管制度不同，总是有配偶关系。只要这一事实存在，旧法中就提供了不少材料可以批判吸收。”
    芮沐认为：“法作为统治阶级的意志，在敌对阶级之间，是不能继承的。但是法作为文化知识现象，而成为文化遗产的一部分时，是可以考虑接受的。”有些人认为：将法分为统治阶级意志和文化现象两方面，不一定恰当。
    对于我国新旧法之间有无继承性问题，也展开了争论。张鑫说：“说在我国旧法和新法之间有继承性，是与废除‘六法’的事实及司法改革运动的精神不符的。”他认为：“有继承性并不等于任何一个国家都要继承。我国对旧法就没有继承，因为：（1）国民党的法律是极端反动的；（2）我们根据地发展起来的法制可以适应建国初期的需要。”孙国华不同意这一意见，认为：“不能单从创制规范的两种形式——制定和认可，来看新旧法之间有无继承性，对旧法律规范的认可固然是继承的一种表现，就是在制定规范时候我们也不能说立法者不受旧法律形式的影响。”
    许多人谈到，国民党政府的“六法全书”是极为反动的，并且是抄袭了资本主义国家和中国封建时期的法律，拼凑而成的，将它彻底废除是完全正确的。有些人谈到，废除旧法与法有继承性并不矛盾，是适合于中国情况的。
    法的阶级性与继承性的关系
    关于法的阶级性与继承性的关系问题，比较一致的认识是二者并不是绝对排斥的。张映南说：“法是有阶级性的，也是有继承性的，法的阶级性并不排斥继承性。”王珉也认为：“强调法的阶级性否认法的继承性的说法是片面的。而强调法的继承性，抹杀法的阶级性，则又是超阶级的观点。”
    对于如何认识法在社会意识形态中的特殊性问题有些争论。李琪说：“有的人过分强调了法律的特殊性。法律是有阶级性的，一定时期的法律反映着一定时期的统治阶级的意志，否认这点是不对的。但是过分强调法律的阶级性，脱离社会文化思想发展的一般规律，把特殊从一般中割裂开来，也是不对的。”沈宗灵认为：“旧法作为一个文化现象来说，不能因法的特殊性而脱离了社会文化思想发展的一般规律。但我也认为法的特殊性应充分强调。要考虑到以下两点：第一，法一方面是作为统治阶级的意志，由国家强制力保证执行的行为规则，另一方面，它又是一个文化现象，我们这里谈继承时，对象不是指作为国家强制力保证的行为规则的法，而是作为文化现象或文化遗产的法。第二，法的阶级性比其它文化现象更强。”
    在讨论中，有些发言还提到：苏联在1917年11月关于法院的第一号命令和1918年3月关于法院的第二号命令中，根据当时具体的历史情况都曾规定在审理民事案方面，可以沿用未经废除的、与社会主义法律意识不相抵触的旧法律。在波兰、民主德国也曾经沿用了某些作过补充修改的革命前的法典。有些人认为：这是法的阶级性与继承性在事实中的表现。但也有人认为这不过是废除旧法的不同的具体形式。
    讨论中大家感到法的阶级性与继承性的关系问题是一个十分复杂的问题，需要作具体的研究分析。
    继承什么？
    关于继承什么的问题，陈盛清说：“新法中也包含有旧法中的积极成分，如（1）新旧法律现象方面具有共性的东西，如由于父母子女和夫妻而产生的血亲、姻亲及计算亲等的方法等。（2）资产阶级革命时期所提出的民主、自由、平等等口号，具有人民性。我们的民主吸收了资产阶级民主制中的一些积极东西，才发展成为最高类型的民主。”程筱鹤认为应当继承的东西是：“（1）在某些旧法中有一点民主的进步的因素。（2）在旧法中某些思想材料可以批判地吸收来为新法服务。（3）旧法中某些概念、推理、判断，是过去长期法制工作的经验积累，其中包含着或多或少的科学成分，可以批判地吸收。”
    对于应当继承什么具体内容，李浩培认为：“以拿破仑法典为例，它有三个基本原则：（1）契约自由、契约必须履行的原则。这是对资产阶级有利的。但就契约必须履行这点来讲，苏联已经继承了。（2）私有财产神圣的原则。这是反动的。但去掉私有，关于所有权的概念，财产神圣的原则，在社会主义公有制下是可以继承的。（3）公民民事权利平等的原则。这是资产阶级用来欺骗人民的。但平等是无产阶级也要的。”有的发言认为把继承的概念过分扩大了是不正确的。
    继承旧法的形式还是内容？有人认为，法的内容是所谓“阶级内容”，因此只可能继承法的形式方面。而另外有些意见认为形式与内容是不能割裂的，新旧法在内容与形式上都有继承性。争论中，反映出对法的形式这一概念也有不同的理解。
