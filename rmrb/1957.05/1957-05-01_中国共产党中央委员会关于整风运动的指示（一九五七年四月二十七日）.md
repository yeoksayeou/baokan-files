Summary of the Central Committee Instructions:

	In recent years, within our Party, bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism, divorced from the masses and divorced from reality, have grown anew. Therefore, the Central Committee believes it is necessary to carry out a new, widespread, and in-depth rectification movement throughout the Party, in accordance with the principle of "starting from the desire for unity, going through criticism and self-criticism, and achieving new unity on a new basis." This rectification movement should take Comrade Mao Zedong's two reports as its ideological guidance and take the correct handling of contradictions among the people as the theme of the current rectification. This rectification movement should be an ideological education movement that is both serious and earnest, yet gentle and mild. It should be a movement of appropriate criticism and self-criticism. Non-Party members who wish to participate in the rectification movement should be welcomed. However, it must be entirely voluntary, not forced, and they should be allowed to withdraw freely at any time. While carrying out the rectification movement, we should also advocate throughout the Party that the main leading personnel of Party, government, and military organizations at all levels who have the ability to work should spend part of their time participating in physical labor with workers and peasants, and begin to further establish a fundamental system that combines mental and physical labor for leading personnel of the Party and the state. The rectification plan should implement the principle of "not delaying rectification or work," and the conduct of the rectification movement should be combined with the improvement of work and with the specific resolution of contradictions among the people, preventing closed-door rectification that hinders work.

(I)

	The first rectification movement of our Party, which began in 1942, resulted in a great revolutionary victory. Now, our country has entered a period of socialist construction from the period of revolution and is in a new, dramatic, and great transformation. Social relations have fundamentally changed, and people's ideology is also changing accordingly. For our Party and the working class to be able to further and better lead the transformation of the entire society and the construction of a new society, to be able to better mobilize all positive forces, unite all who can be united, and transform negative forces into positive forces, striving towards the goal of building a great socialist country, it is necessary to transform ourselves at the same time. However, many comrades within the Party do not understand or do not fully understand this new situation and the new tasks of the Party. At the same time, because the Party is in a ruling position throughout the country and has won the support of the broad masses, many comrades easily adopt the method of purely administrative orders to deal with problems, and some elements with unstable positions easily become tainted with the remnants of the Kuomintang style of the old society, forming a kind of privileged thinking, and even treating the masses with methods of attack and oppression. In recent years, within our Party, bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism, divorced from the masses and divorced from reality, have grown anew. Therefore, the Central Committee believes it is necessary to carry out a new, widespread, and in-depth rectification movement throughout the Party against bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism, in accordance with the principle of "starting from the desire for unity, going through criticism and self-criticism, and achieving new unity on a new basis," to raise the Party's Marxist ideological level and improve its style of work, in order to adapt to the needs of socialist transformation and socialist construction.

(II)

	This rectification movement should take Comrade Mao Zedong's two reports made in February this year at the enlarged Supreme State Conference and in March at the propaganda conference convened by the Central Committee as its ideological guidance, and take the correct handling of contradictions among the people as the theme of the current rectification. Comrade Mao Zedong's two reports have already been conveyed to the broad masses of cadres and intellectuals, and will continue to be conveyed to all Party members and the people. The transmission of these two reports has aroused heated discussions inside and outside the Party. As far as our Party is concerned, this is actually the beginning of the rectification movement. Party committees at all levels must organize the study of these two reports, summarize and improve the work of their respective regions, departments, and units in accordance with the basic ideas of these two reports, and with reference to some other relevant documents. In the study, for leading organs and cadres at all levels, the main thing is to examine the situation of handling contradictions among the people, to examine the implementation of the Party's policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend, long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" and the policy of "building the country with diligence and thrift," to examine those bureaucratic phenomena that are divorced from the worker masses, peasant masses, soldier masses, students, and intellectual masses, to examine those sectarian phenomena that do not proceed from uniting the 600 million people, do not proceed from uniting all nationalities, all parties, and the broad masses of non-Party members, and do not proceed from uniting the whole Party, and to examine those subjective phenomena that do not proceed from the actual situation, and to truly implement the Central Committee's instructions on "correctly handling contradictions among the people." For general Party members, the main thing is to require them to understand: serving the people; consulting with the masses on matters; bearing hardships before enjoying benefits; and implementing criticism and self-criticism. For intellectual Party members, in addition to the above requirements, it is also necessary to focus on requiring them to connect with the worker and peasant masses, distinguish between the proletarian stand and the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois stands, overcome individualism and liberalism tendencies, and strengthen Party spirit. In order to overcome subjectivity and one-sidedness in thinking methods, leading cadres and intellectual Party members must also conduct studies of dialectical materialism at an appropriate time in the future. The plan for this study will be specified separately in the future.

(III)

	This rectification movement should be an ideological education movement that is both serious and earnest, yet gentle and mild. It should be a movement of appropriate criticism and self-criticism. Meetings should be limited to small-scale discussion meetings and group meetings, and the method of heart-to-heart talks among comrades, that is, individual conversations, should be used more, and criticism meetings or struggle meetings should not be held. Whether in discussion meetings, group meetings, when conducting criticism, or in individual conversations, criticism should be boldly encouraged, and the principle of "say all you know and say it without reservation; the speaker is not to be blamed, and the listener should take warning; correct mistakes if you have made them, and guard against them if you have not" should be resolutely implemented. One should not affirm everything about oneself and reject the criticism of others. At the same time, we should advocate that critics seek truth from facts and make concrete analyses, so as not to obliterate everything about others and turn criticism into one-sided and excessive criticism. Everyone should humbly listen to the opinions of others and actively offer opinions to others, but should not force the criticized to accept criticisms they do not agree with. For some principled disputes, necessary conclusions should be made when possible, but different opinions must be allowed to be reserved. For those who have made mistakes as a result of the rectification movement, regardless of the size of the mistake, except for those who seriously violate laws and discipline, no organizational punishment will be given, and active and patient assistance will be given to them, so as to achieve the purpose of "learning from past mistakes to avoid future ones, and curing the sickness to save the patient."

	Non-Party members who wish to participate in the rectification movement should be welcomed. However, it must be entirely voluntary, not forced, and they should be allowed to withdraw freely at any time.

(IV)

	In order to strengthen the Party's ties with the broad masses of working people and thoroughly change the phenomenon of many leading personnel being divorced from the masses, while carrying out the rectification movement, we should advocate throughout the Party that the main leading personnel of Party, government, and military organizations at all levels who have the ability to work should spend part of their time participating in physical labor with workers and peasants, and gradually form this method into a permanent system. For a long time in history, our Party's leading cadres shared weal and woe with the worker, peasant, and soldier masses. This fine tradition of close ties with the masses is one of the basic factors that guaranteed the victory of the Chinese revolution. However, in recent years, many comrades have regressed in this regard. At present, in addition to carrying out rectification and learning, improving ideological understanding within the Party, and correcting shortcomings and mistakes in work, the Party's task is to fully maintain and promote our Party's fine tradition of hard struggle in practical life, and to begin to further establish a fundamental system that combines mental and physical labor for leading personnel of the Party and the state, so that leaders and the masses are integrated, the relationship among the people is given a new look, and bureaucracy, sectarianism, subjectivism, and the airs of officials are greatly reduced. The method of combining mental and physical labor for leading personnel of the Party and the state should start with a small number of people within the Party. Even a small amount of physical labor is good. After gaining experience, and through appropriate steps, it will be gradually and systematically popularized to leading Party, government, and military personnel and to the main management personnel in economic and cultural organizations who are able to engage in some labor. Regarding this issue, it is necessary to stipulate some specific measures, and the Central Committee will issue separate instructions.

(V)

	This rectification movement should first start from Party organizations above the county level and above the regiment level in the army, as well as Party organizations in large factories, mines, and universities, and should first start from examining the ideology and work style of leading cadres. The Party committees of each province, city, and autonomous region can simultaneously select several grassroots Party committees to conduct rectification and learning, in order to obtain typical experience and gradually promote it.

	When carrying out the rectification movement, each unit should organize a leading group. The first secretary of the Party committee must personally take charge and grasp the leadership tightly. The rectification plan should implement the principle of "not delaying rectification or work," and the conduct of the rectification movement must be combined with the improvement of work and with the specific resolution of contradictions among the people, preventing closed-door rectification that hinders work. The organizational leadership methods and specific work plans for rectification shall be stipulated and implemented by the Party committees directly under the Central Committee, the Party Committee of the Central State Organs, the General Political Department, and the Party committees of each province (city) and autonomous region themselves, and it is hoped that these specific plans can be reported to the Central Committee within two weeks after receiving these instructions.

    中国共产党中央委员会关于整风运动的指示
    （一九五七年四月二十七日）
    中央指示的提要
    几年以来，在我们党内，脱离群众和脱离实际的官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义，有了新的滋长。因此，中央认为有必要按照“从团结的愿望出发，经过批评和自我批评，在新的基础上达到新的团结”的方针，在全党重新进行一次普遍的、深入的整风运动。——这次整风运动应当以毛泽东同志的两个报告为思想的指导，把正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题作为当前整风的主题。——这次整风运动，应该是一次既严肃认真又和风细雨的思想教育运动，应该是一个恰如其分的批评和自我批评的运动。——非党员愿意参加整风运动，应该欢迎。但是必须完全出于自愿，不得强迫，并且允许随时自由退出。——在进行整风运动的同时，应该在全党提倡各级党政军有劳动力的主要领导人员以一部分时间同工人农民一起参加体力劳动的办法，并且着手进一步建立党和国家的领导工作人员的脑力劳动和体力劳动相结合的根本制度。——整风计划应该贯彻整风和工作两不误的原则，并且使整风运动的进行同工作的改进结合起来，同人民内部矛盾的具体解决结合起来，防止关门整风，妨害工作。
    （一）
    我们的党一九四二年开始的第一次整风运动，取得了伟大革命胜利的结果。现在，我们的国家已经从革命的时期进入了社会主义建设的时期，正处在一个新的剧烈的伟大的变革中。社会的关系根本变化了，人们的思想意识也在随着变化。我们的党和工人阶级要能够进一步地更好地领导全社会的改造和新社会的建设，要能够更好地调动一切积极力量，团结一切可能团结的人，并且将消极力量转化为积极力量，为着建设一个伟大的社会主义国家的目标而奋斗，必需同时改造自己。但是，党内有许多同志，并不了解或者不很了解这种新情况和党的新任务。同时，又因为党已经在全国范围内处在执政的地位，得到了广大群众的拥护，有许多同志就容易采取单纯的行政命令的办法去处理问题，而有一部分立场不坚定的分子，就容易沾染旧社会国民党作风的残余，形成一种特权思想，甚至用打击压迫的方法对待群众。几年以来，在我们党内，脱离群众和脱离实际的官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义，有了新的滋长。因此，中央认为有必要按照“从团结的愿望出发，经过批评和自我批评，在新的基础上达到新的团结”的方针，在全党重新进行一次普遍的、深入的反官僚主义、反宗派主义、反主观主义的整风运动，提高全党的马克思主义的思想水平，改进作风，以适应社会主义改造和社会主义建设的需要。
    （二）
    这次整风运动应当以毛泽东同志今年二月在扩大的最高国务会议上和三月在中央召开的宣传会议上代表中央所作的两个报告为思想的指导，把正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题作为当前整风的主题。毛泽东同志的这两个报告已经在广大的干部和知识分子中传达，以后还要继续在全体党员和人民群众中传达。这两个报告的传达引起了党内党外的热烈讨论，就我们党来说，实际上，这就是整风运动的开始。各级党委必须组织关于这两个报告的学习，按照这两个报告的基本思想，并参考一些其他有关的文件，总结和改进本地区、本部门、本单位的工作。在学习中，对于各级领导机关和干部，主要的是要检查处理人民内部矛盾问题的情况，检查对于党的“百花齐放、百家争鸣、长期共存、互相监督”方针和“勤俭建国”方针的执行情况，检查那些脱离工人群众、农民群众、士兵群众、学生和知识分子群众的官僚主义现象，检查那些不从团结六亿人民出发、不从团结各民族各党派和广大的党外群众出发、不从团结全党出发的宗派主义现象，检查那些不从实际情况出发的主观主义现象，而真正地贯彻执行中央关于“正确地处理人民内部矛盾问题”的指示。对于一般党员，主要的是要求他们懂得：为人民服务；有事和群众商量；吃苦在前，得利在后；实行批评和自我批评。对于知识分子党员，除了上述各项要求以外，还要着重要求他们联系工农群众，分清无产阶级立场和资产阶级、小资产阶级立场，克服个人主义和自由主义倾向，加强党性。为了克服思想方法上的主观性和片面性，领导干部和知识分子党员还必须在今后的适当时期进行唯物辩证法的学习，关于这一方面学习的计划，将来另行规定。
    （三）
    这次整风运动，应该是一次既严肃认真又和风细雨的思想教育运动，应该是一个恰如其分的批评和自我批评的运动。开会应该只限于人数不多的座谈会和小组会，应该多采用同志间谈心的方式，即个别地交谈，而不要开批评大会，或者斗争大会。不论在座谈会、小组会上，进行批评的时候，或者个别交谈的时候，都应该放手鼓励批评，坚决实行“知无不言，言无不尽；言者无罪，闻者足戒；有则改之，无则加勉”的原则，不应该肯定自己的一切，拒绝别人的批评。同时，对于批评者要提倡实事求是，具体分析，以免抹杀别人的一切，使批评变成片面的过火的批评。每个人都应该虚心地听取别人的意见，积极地向别人提意见，但是不得强迫被批评者接受他所不同意的批评。对于一些带原则性的争论，可能的时候应该作出必要的结论，但是必须容许保留不同的意见。对于在整风运动中检查出来犯了错误的人，不论错误大小，除严重违法乱纪者外，一概不给以组织上的处分，并且要给以积极的、耐心的帮助，这样来达到“惩前毖后、治病救人”的目的。
    非党员愿意参加整风运动，应该欢迎。但是必须完全出于自愿，不得强迫，并且允许随时自由退出。
    （四）
    为了加强党同广大劳动人民的联系，彻底改变许多领导人员脱离群众的现象，在进行整风运动的同时，应该在全党提倡各级党政军有劳动力的主要领导人员以一部分时间同工人农民一起参加体力劳动的办法，并且使这个办法逐步地形成为一种永久的制度。我们党的领导干部在历史上长时期是同工农兵群众同甘共苦的，这种密切联系群众的优良作风是保证中国革命胜利的基本因素之一。但是近几年来，有许多同志在这一方面是退步了。目前党的任务，除了进行整风学习，提高党内思想认识、改正工作中的缺点错误以外，还要在实际生活中完全保持和发扬我们党的艰苦奋斗的优良传统，并且着手进一步建立党和国家的领导工作人员的脑力劳动和体力劳动相结合的根本制度，使领导者同群众打成一片，使人民内部的关系面貌一新，使官僚主义、宗派主义、主观主义、老爷架子，大大减少。党和国家的领导工作人员的脑力劳动和体力劳动相结合的办法，应该先从党内的少数人员作起。这种体力劳动，那怕很少一点也是好的。待取得经验之后，经过适当步骤，再有计划地逐步地普及到凡能多少从事劳动的党政军领导工作人员和经济、文化组织中的主要管理人员。关于这个问题，需要规定一些具体办法，中央将另作专门指示。
    （五）
    这次整风运动，应该首先从县级以上、军队团级以上的党的组织以及大的厂矿和大专学校的党的组织开始，并且应该首先从检查领导干部的思想作风开始。各省委、市委、自治区党委可以同时选择若干基层党委进行整风学习，以便取得典型经验，逐步推广。
    在进行整风运动的时候，各单位应该组织领导小组。党委的第一书记必须亲自负责，抓紧领导。整风计划应该贯彻整风和工作两不误的原则，并且必须使整风运动的进行同工作的改进结合起来，同人民内部矛盾的具体解决结合起来，防止关门整风，妨害工作。整风的组织领导办法和具体工作计划，由中央直属党委、中央国家机关党委、总政治部和各省（市）委、自治区党委自己规定实行，并且希望于收到本指示以后两星期内能够将这种具体计划报告中央。
