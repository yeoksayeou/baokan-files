Laboring for Socialism
—In Commemoration of the “May Fourth” Youth Day

China's glorious and militant "May Fourth" Youth Day has arrived again amidst the cheers of the nation's youth. Over the past thirty-eight years, the Chinese people have realized the aspirations of revolutionary predecessors, arranged the course of progress, and not only overthrown the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism in China, establishing a new China, but have also basically achieved victory in the socialist revolution. The people of the whole country are implementing the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy. This year is the last year of the first five-year plan. Commemorating "May Fourth" Youth Day in this important year will further encourage the vast number of young people in our country to carry out great labor for the construction of a socialist motherland!

Building a socialist society requires the heroic labor of all the people, including the vast number of young people. Youth is the most active and vital part of the entire social force. Youth has always stood at the forefront of the struggle. The vast number of young people in our country have already demonstrated their vitality as a shock force on all fronts of socialist construction with high enthusiasm and heroic labor. On the industrial production front, many advanced youth teams have emerged, and a large number of advanced youth figures are also growing rapidly, throwing themselves into the socialist production competition, walking ahead of time, and setting off a wave of learning to advance towards culture and science. Young people in the countryside have also devoted themselves to the upsurge of agricultural production with high enthusiasm, widely establishing youth shock brigades, playing the shock role of youth, and increasing agricultural production. In schools, the vast number of young students study hard, constantly improve their political and cultural levels, learn their skills well, and prepare to participate in the construction of the motherland. Many middle and primary school graduates have participated in industrial and agricultural production, engaged in glorious physical labor, and become excellent workers and educated farmers.

However, when we commemorate "May Fourth" Youth Day today in the high tide of socialist construction, we must not be satisfied with past achievements. The vast number of young people in our country should further inherit the revolutionary tradition, carry forward the spirit of patriotism, and strive with greater efforts to build our country into an advanced industrial nation.

Inheriting the revolutionary tradition and carrying forward the spirit of patriotism is not just an empty phrase, but a slogan for action. Who truly inherits the revolutionary tradition must be proven in practice. We should oppose in practice the ideological tendencies of belittling labor, seeking comfort, pursuing personal enjoyment, and being concerned about fame and status. We should learn from the revolutionary predecessors' style of hard work and thrift, learn from their thinking of wholeheartedly serving the people, and learn from their spirit of revolutionary optimism. After receiving revolutionary tradition education, 124 young machinists at the Tianjin No. 1 Machine Tool Plant had a clear understanding of the relationship between the country and the individual. Their production enthusiasm generally increased, and they proposed "to be a machinist who does the most beautiful work," greatly increasing labor productivity. Young people in Ruijin County launched activities to learn from the excellent traditions of the revolutionary elders, understanding that happiness must be achieved through hard labor. They actively prepared to win the battle on the agricultural front. Outstanding young people on all fronts in our country should learn from this example and inherit the great revolutionary tradition with practical actions.

On the industrial production front, the vast number of young people must engage in tenacious and creative labor, overcome waste, strive to increase production, actively participate in the advanced producer movement, and, together with all workers, push the high tide of industrial construction further forward. In the advanced producer movement, young people should learn and master new technologies, promote advanced experiences, lead others, and advance together. Young people on the agricultural production front should continue to carry forward the spirit of hard work, oppose the view of belittling labor, actively participate in various agricultural activities, painstakingly study agricultural science and technology, learn from the advanced experiences of veteran farmers, actively and steadily promote new technologies and advanced experiences, enthusiastically offer suggestions, and strive for a bumper harvest this year. On the industrial and agricultural fronts of the socialist construction of the motherland, especially on the agricultural front, there is an urgent need for educated youth to participate in construction. Young students studying in schools should be determined to go to the countryside, to the mines, to the border areas, to all places where the motherland needs them, carry forward the excellent revolutionary traditions of our country, share weal and woe with workers and peasants, and engage in physical labor together.

The Central Committee of the Party recently issued instructions on the rectification movement, emphasizing the combination of mental and physical labor. This instruction from the Central Committee of the Party is not only of great significance for strengthening the connection between the Party and the broad masses of working people and thoroughly changing the phenomenon of many leading personnel being divorced from the masses; it is also an extremely important enlightenment for the vast number of young people, especially educated youth, in realizing the combination of mental and physical labor and in integrating with the workers and peasants, and putting down the airs of intellectuals. From the principles of communism, mental labor and physical labor should be combined, and cases of good combination have already begun to appear among young people. Twenty-three senior primary school graduates from Yuanguang Village in Dingxian County, Hebei Province, organized an agricultural technology research group, actively studying and promoting agricultural technology on the one hand, and conducting practical operations in experimental fields on the other, achieving good results, which is a proof of this.

Whether in the past, now, or in the future, physical labor is an indispensable labor for creating social wealth. What is the foundation upon which human society survives, develops, and grows stronger? It is the productive labor in industry and agriculture, especially physical labor. Without this labor, humanity cannot obtain the necessary material means of life. Students learn scientific and technological knowledge in order to better engage in labor, improve labor skills, and change labor with low productivity into labor with higher productivity. The idea of belittling physical labor is essentially a corrupt idea of the exploiting class. If educated youth go to labor and form a beautiful marriage with labor, they will bloom with happy flowers and bear happy fruits. Young people all yearn for a bright future, but for a bright future, they must first endure some hardships, and they must not be afraid of hardships. "After suffering comes sweetness" is an ancient Chinese saying, which has its rich and profound practical significance. If educated youth cannot go to higher education, they should happily participate in productive labor, especially agricultural productive labor. The broad masses of the people, including the parents of students, should support the noble behavior of young people participating in labor.

Mobilizing the nation's youth to actively participate in socialist construction, participate in productive labor, and guide the nation's youth to advance towards the greatest goals is the lofty task of the Communist Youth League. The New Democratic Youth League will soon change its name to the Communist Youth League through its Third National Congress. At a time when the Youth League has become a reliable reserve force of the Party and has become a huge force attracting the vigorous progress of the nation's youth, and at a time when our country's socialist transformation has achieved a decisive victory, doing so is fully in line with the wishes of the vast number of young people. The renaming of the New Democratic Youth League to the Communist Youth League is not just a change of name; it shows that the motherland has put forward more lofty tasks to the vast number of young people, and the Party has entrusted the vast number of young people with more important commissions. Youth League members should strengthen their studies, work hard, improve their communist consciousness, and prepare to be true communist youth fighters. Youth League members must constantly educate the youth masses, raise their communist consciousness, strengthen their labor views, and, together with the vast number of youth masses, actively participate in industrial and agricultural productive labor, especially in agricultural physical labor, and strive to complete and over fulfill the first five-year plan ahead of schedule. Let us congratulate the glorious Youth League members and the glorious laboring youth on achieving great victories in their heroic labor in building socialism!

### 为着社会主义而劳动——纪念“五四”青年节

    为着社会主义而劳动
    ——纪念“五四”青年节
    中国青年光荣的战斗的“五四”青年节，在全国青年的欢庆声中又到来了。三十八年来，中国人民实现了革命前辈的愿望，安排了前进的里程，不仅推翻了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义在中国的统治，建立了新中国，而且已经基本上取得了社会主义革命的胜利。全国人民正在执行发展国民经济的第一个五年计划。今年是第一个五年计划最后的一年。在这个重要的年头，来纪念“五四”青年节，将更加鼓舞我国广大青年进一步为着建设社会主义的祖国而进行伟大的劳动！
    建设社会主义社会，需要全国人民，包括广大青年的英勇劳动。青年是整个社会力量中最积极最有生气的一部分。青年在任何时候都站在斗争的前哨。我国广大青年在社会主义建设的各个战线上，已经以高度的热情，英勇的劳动，表现为一支生气勃勃的突击力量。在工业生产战线上，出现了许多青年先进班，大批的青年先进人物也在迅速成长起来，投入社会主义生产竞赛，走在时间的前边，在学习上掀起了向文化、科学进军的热潮。农村中的青年，也以高度热情投入了农业生产的高潮，广泛地建立了青年突击队，发挥了青年的突击作用，提高农业生产。在学校里，广大青年学生努力学习，不断提高政治和文化水平，学好本领，为参加祖国建设作好准备。许多中、小学毕业生参加了工农业生产，进行了光荣的体力劳动，成为优秀的工人和有文化的农民。
    但是，当我们今天在社会主义建设的高潮里来纪念“五四”青年节的时候，我们决不能满足于过去的成就。我国广大青年应该进一步继承革命传统，发扬爱国主义精神，用更大的努力为把我国建设成为一个先进的工业国而斗争。
    继承革命传统，发扬爱国主义精神，不是一句空话，而是行动的口号。谁是真正继承了革命的传统，这要从实践中去证明。我们应该在实践中反对那种轻视劳动，希图安逸，追求个人生活享受，计较名誉地位的思想倾向，学习革命前辈的艰苦朴素、克勤克俭的作风，学习他们全心全意为人民服务的思想，学习他们的革命乐观主义的精神。天津市第一机床厂一百二十四名青年机工，在受到革命传统教育以后，对国家和个人的关系有了明确的认识，生产热情普遍高涨，提出“立志做一个干活最漂亮的机工”，劳动生产率大大提高。瑞金县青年开展了学习革命长辈优良传统的活动，懂得必须经过艰苦的劳动，才有幸福的生活，积极准备在农业战线上打胜仗。我国各个战线上的优秀青年，都应该学这种榜样，用实际行动来继承伟大的革命传统。
    在工业生产战线上，广大青年要进行顽强的创造性的劳动，克服浪费，努力增产，积极参加先进生产者运动，同全体工人一道，把工业建设高潮向前推进一步。在先进生产者运动中，青年要学习和掌握新的技术，推广先进经验，带动别人，共同前进。在农业生产战线上的青年，要继续发扬艰苦奋斗的精神，反对轻视劳动的观点，积极参加各种农事活动，刻苦钻研农业科学技术，学习老农的先进经验，积极而又稳妥地推广新技术和先进经验，踊跃献计献策，全力争取今年的大丰收。在祖国社会主义建设的工农业战线上，首先是农业战线上，迫切需要知识青年去参加建设。在学校中学习的青年学生，应当立志到农村，到矿山，到边疆，到祖国需要的一切地方去，发扬我国革命的优良传统，同工人、农民同甘共苦，一道去进行体力劳动。
    党中央最近发布的关于整风运动的指示，着重提倡脑力劳动和体力劳动相结合。党中央的这个指示，不仅对于加强党同广大劳动人民的联系，彻底改变许多领导人员脱离群众的现象有重大意义；对于广大青年，特别是知识青年来说，在实现脑力劳动和体力劳动相结合方面，在同工农群众打成一片，放下知识分子的架子方面，也是极其重要的启示。从共产主义的原则来说，脑力劳动和体力劳动应该结合，而且在青年中也已经开始出现了结合得很好的事例。河北省定县元光村二十三名高小毕业生组织了农业技术研究小组，一方面积极钻研和推广农业技术，一方面又在试验田里进行实际操作，取得了很好的效果，这就是一个证明。
    无论是过去也好，现在也好，将来也好，体力劳动都是创造社会财富的必不可少的劳动。人类社会赖以生存、发展和壮大的基础是什么呢？就是工农业中的生产劳动，首先是体力劳动。没有这种劳动，人类就不能得到必需的物质生活资料。学生学习科学技术知识，也就是为了更好地去进行劳动，提高劳动的技能，把生产率不高的劳动，改变为生产率较高的劳动。那种轻视体力劳动的思想，实质上是一种剥削阶级的腐朽思想。知识青年到劳动中去，同劳动结下美好的姻缘，就会开出幸福的花，结成幸福的果。青年人都憧憬未来美好的生活，但是为了美好的未来，就得先吃些苦，就得不怕吃苦。“苦尽甘来”，这是我国一句古老的格言，是有它的丰富而深刻的实践意义的。知识青年如果不能升学，就应该愉快地去参加生产劳动，首先是农业生产劳动。广大的人民群众应当赞助青年参加劳动的高尚行为，包括学生的家长在内。
    动员全国青年积极参加社会主义建设事业，参加生产劳动，引导全国青年向最伟大的目标前进，这是青年团的崇高任务。新民主主义青年团即将通过它的第三次全国代表大会改名为共产主义青年团。在青年团已经成为党的一支可靠的后备队，已经成为吸引全国青年蓬勃向上的一个巨大的力量的时候，在我国社会主义改造已经取得决定性胜利的时候，这样做是完全符合广大青年的愿望的。新民主主义青年团改名为共产主义青年团，并不仅是名称的更换，它说明了祖国向广大青年提出了更崇高的任务，党付给广大青年更重大的委托。青年团员应该加强学习，努力工作，提高共产主义自觉性，准备着做一个真正的共产主义的青年战士。青年团员要不断教育青年群众，提高共产主义觉悟，加强劳动观点，并且同广大青年群众在一道，积极参加工农业生产劳动，首先是参加农业的体力劳动，争取提前完成和超额完成第一个五年计划。让我们祝贺光荣的青年团员和光荣的劳动青年在建设社会主义的英勇劳动中取得伟大的胜利！
