    According to Western news agency reports: The Tunisian cabinet held an emergency meeting on May 23 to discuss France's statement regarding the suspension of "economic aid" to Tunisia. On May 24, the Tunisian government issued a communique stating that Tunisia intends to "establish healthy and normal cooperation with France and all other countries." However, since France has decided to suspend "aid," Tunisia is determined to break free from the shackles of the "colonial treaties" imposed by the French government.
    The Franco-Tunisian agreement was signed in 1955. In this agreement, France continued to maintain control over Tunisia's defense and foreign affairs under the conditions of granting Tunisia "internal autonomy" and establishing "the principle of co-management."
    Tunisia gained independence in March of last year. As a result of long-term French colonial rule, independent Tunisia faces economic difficulties and remains largely dependent on France. In 1956, Tunisia's fiscal deficit reached billions of francs. France's sudden announcement of the suspension of so-called "aid" will subject Tunisia to new economic hardships.
    In its statement regarding the suspension of "aid," France stated that its action was due to "Tunisia's aid and sympathy for Algerian rebels." However, observers believe that this is only a secondary reason for France's action. The important reason is related to the increasingly blatant activities of the United States in courting Tunisia. Especially after the emergence of the "Eisenhower Doctrine," France has become very sensitive to American activities in North Africa. Former French Foreign Minister Pineau expressed opposition to the inclusion of North Africa in the "Eisenhower Doctrine." Former French Deputy Foreign Minister Fauré also warned the United States that "if the United States believes that it...must 'aid' Tunisia and Morocco, it can only do so with our consent." He also "hoped" that "the United States would understand this."
    Not long ago, US Vice President Nixon and US Presidential Envoy Richards visited Tunisia one after the other and tried their best to entice Tunisia with American "aid." However, while Richards pretended to be generous in words during his visit to Tunisia, he only actually promised to provide three million US dollars in "aid." Therefore, news has it that Tunisian Prime Minister Bourguiba expressed "significant disappointment."

### 美法在北非顶牛的侧影  法国宣布停止“援助”突尼斯  突尼斯决心摆脱殖民主义条约的束缚

    美法在北非顶牛的侧影
    法国宣布停止“援助”突尼斯
    突尼斯决心摆脱殖民主义条约的束缚
    本报讯　据西方通讯社报道：突尼斯内阁于5月23日召开紧急会议，讨论了法国关于停止给予突尼斯“经济援助”的声明。5月24日，突尼斯政府发表公报说，突尼斯打算“和法国以及所有其他的国家建立健康的和正常的合作”。但是，既然法国已经决定停止“援助”，突尼斯就决心摆脱法国政府所强加的“殖民主义条约”的束缚。
    法—突协定是在1955年签订的。在这个协定中，法国在给予突尼斯“内政自治权”和确定“共管原则”等条件下，把突尼斯的国防和外交权力继续放在自己的控制下。
    突尼斯是在去年3月获得独立的，由于受到法国长期殖民统治的结果，独立后的突尼斯在经济上比较困难，并且仍然在很大程度上依赖法国。1956年突尼斯的财政赤字就达数十亿法郎。法国突然宣布停止所谓“援助”，将使突尼斯在经济上受到新的困难。
    法国在关于停止“援助”的声明里说，法国的这一行动是由于“突尼斯援助和同情阿尔及利亚反叛分子”。但是，观察家们认为，这仅仅是法国采取这一措施的次要原因。而重要的原因是同美国最近越来越露骨地拉拢突尼斯的活动有关的。特别是在“艾森豪威尔主义”出笼以后，法国对美国在北非的活动变得非常敏感。法国前外交部长比诺曾表示反对“艾森豪威尔主义”包括北非。法国前外交部副部长富尔也曾警告过美国说，“如果美国认为它……必须‘援助’突尼斯和摩洛哥，那只有在我们的同意下才能这样做。”他并且“希望”“美国会了解这一点”。
    不久以前，美国副总统尼克松和美国总统特使理查兹曾先后到突尼斯去进行活动，并且竭力以美“援”来诱惑突尼斯。但是，理查兹在访问突尼斯的时候，虽然在口头上假装慷慨，但在实际上却只答应给予三百万美元的“援助”。因此，有消息说，突尼斯首相布尔吉巴曾表示了“重大的失望”。
