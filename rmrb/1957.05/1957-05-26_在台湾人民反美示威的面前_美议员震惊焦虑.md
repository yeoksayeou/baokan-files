Xinhua News Agency, May 25th: Washington Dispatch: Surprise, shock, and anxiety are the common reactions among U.S. Congressmen to the large-scale anti-American demonstration that erupted in Taipei on May 24th.

    Senator Bourke Hickenlooper, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said that this "is a very serious matter, and I feel very sorry about it. This is something we should consider carefully." He demanded "action that is in line with our own interests according to the situation in the East" to "ensure that it (the anti-American demonstration) does not happen again."

    Senator William Knowland, the Republican leader in the Senate who has always been the strongest supporter of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, denounced and berated the Chiang Kai-shek clique. He said that the anti-American demonstration was "shocking" and "inexcusable" to him.

    The Chiang Kai-shek clique’s "even swift action to restore order cannot offset this irresponsible mob riot." He demanded "guarantees that such incidents will not happen again."

    Senate Democratic Leader Lyndon B. Johnson also said it was "very regrettable." He said: "The people we have done so much for would destroy our houses and tear down our flags over an accidental incident."

    Former Ambassador to India, Republican Senator John Sherman Cooper, said he was concerned that the incident "reflects a growing resentment towards the presence of U.S. troops in Taiwan." He said he believed this resentment was also growing in other countries.

    Democratic Senator Mike Monroney said he believed that this matter would cause Congress to "carefully study our relationship with Taiwan," and that "this matter will damage this relationship to some extent."

    Democratic Senator Robertson threatened to investigate the "background" of the incident. He said, "No country in the world has received more generous help from our aid program than it (the Chiang Kai-shek clique). We keep them alive. Strong anti-American sentiment must have some background, and this is something we must understand."

    在台湾人民反美示威的面前
    美议员震惊焦虑
    新华社25日讯　华盛顿消息：意外、震惊、焦虑，这是5月24日在台北爆发的反美大示威在美国国会议员中间引起的普遍反应。
    参议院外交委员会委员鲍尔克·希肯鲁普说，这“是一件十分严重的事情，我感到十分遗憾。这是我们应当仔细考虑的事情。”他要求“根据东方的形势采取符合我们自身利益的行动”，以“保证它（反美示威）不再发生”。
    一向支持蒋介石集团最力的参议院共和党领袖诺兰，申斥和责骂蒋介石集团。他说，这次反美示威对他说来是“令人震惊的”，“不可宽恕的”。
    蒋介石集团“即使迅速采取行动恢复了秩序也不能抵消这种不负责任的暴众骚乱”。他要求“保证这类事件不再发生”。
    参议院民主党领袖约翰逊也说这是“非常令人遗憾的”。他说：“我们曾经为之做了这么许多事情的人们竟会为了一次偶然事件而捣毁我们的房屋，扯下我们的国旗”。
    前驻印度大使、共和党参议员约翰·薛尔曼·库柏说，他担心这次事件“反映对美军驻台湾一事的反感越来越大”。他说，他认为这种反感在其他国家也日益增大。
    民主党参议员迈克·门罗尼说，他认为这件事将使国会“仔细研究我们同台湾的关系”，“这件事将对这种关系有一定程度的损害。”
    民主党参议员罗伯逊以威胁的口吻表示要调查这次事件的“背景”。他说，“世界上没有一个国家比它（蒋介石集团）从我们赠与计划中得到更加大方的帮助。我们使他们生存下去。强烈的反美情绪是必定有某种背景的，这是我们必须了解的。”
