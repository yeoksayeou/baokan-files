Xinhua News Agency, Saigon, May 5th: Overseas Chinese in South Vietnam yesterday once again vandalized the Taiwan Kuomintang "Embassy" in Saigon, protesting the Kuomintang's stance on the South Vietnamese authorities' forced naturalization of locally born Overseas Chinese as Vietnamese citizens.

Several hundred young Overseas Chinese held a demonstration at the Kuomintang "Embassy" yesterday. This demonstration occurred after a spokesman for the Kuomintang "Ministry of Foreign Affairs" issued a statement on the 3rd saying that the Kuomintang would "do its best to assist" locally born Overseas Chinese who were unwilling to accept Vietnamese nationality to go to Taiwan. The demonstrating masses demanded that the "Embassy" address the issue of the South Vietnamese authorities forcing them to adopt Vietnamese nationality, and some even stated that their residence permits had been confiscated by the South Vietnamese authorities. According to the South Vietnamese authorities' unilateral regulations, all locally born Overseas Chinese are considered "Vietnamese citizens" from April 8th this year and must exchange for Vietnamese identity cards before May 9th.

Kuomintang "Embassy" officials ordered the young Overseas Chinese who came to demonstrate to hand over their Overseas Chinese registration certificates to the South Vietnamese authorities. The demonstrating masses questioned what would happen to the Overseas Chinese after May 9th if they did so. The emotions of the demonstrators became increasingly激昂, and they rushed into the "Embassy" and vandalized the offices. Kuomintang elements summoned a large number of South Vietnamese armed police to forcibly disperse the demonstrators. Many Overseas Chinese were injured in the incident.

The South Vietnamese authorities began ordering locally born Overseas Chinese to register for Vietnamese nationality as early as August last year. However, this decree was widely resisted by hundreds of thousands of Overseas Chinese. The South Vietnamese authorities later ordered a general registration of Overseas Chinese in March this year, but prohibited locally born Overseas Chinese from participating in this registration. The Kuomintang "Embassy" issued a statement on April 28, expressing its agreement with the South Vietnamese authorities' general registration of Overseas Chinese, but it argued that "locally born Overseas Chinese should be allowed to participate in the general registration as well." This stance of the Kuomintang "Embassy" aroused the anger of the Overseas Chinese. On April 30th, several hundred Overseas Chinese demonstrated at the "Embassy," demanding that the South Vietnamese authorities stop forcing Overseas Chinese to adopt Vietnamese nationality. Driven by righteous indignation, they smashed the doors, windows, and furniture of the "Embassy." The South Vietnamese armed police who came to suppress the demonstration arrested two young Overseas Chinese.

As the deadline for the naturalization of locally born Overseas Chinese approached, the South Vietnamese authorities in various provinces are intensifying their efforts to force Overseas Chinese to go through the procedures for changing nationality and participating in the general registration, and some places have even confiscated the residence permits of locally born Overseas Chinese. Overseas Chinese in various parts of South Vietnam are panicking, and many are trying to leave South Vietnam.

According to Western news agencies, the United States is paying close attention to this matter and may discuss it when Ngo Dinh Diem visits Washington.

### 南越华侨怒砸国民党“使馆”  抗议帮同吴庭艳强迫他们入越南籍

    南越华侨怒砸国民党“使馆”
    抗议帮同吴庭艳强迫他们入越南籍
    新华社5日讯　西贡消息：南越华侨昨天再次捣毁台湾国民党驻西贡“公使馆”，抗议国民党对南越当局强迫土生华侨加入越南籍一事所采取的立场。
    数百名华侨青年昨天到国民党“公使馆”举行示威。这次示威是在国民党“外交部”发言人在3日发表声明说国民党将“尽力协助”不愿接受越南籍的土生华侨到台湾去以后发生的。示威群众向“公使馆”要求处理南越当局强迫他们加入越南籍的问题，有人并且提出他们的居留证已经被南越当局没收。根据南越当局的片面规定，所有土生华侨从今年4月8日起就被认为是“越南公民”，并且必须在5月9日以前换取越南籍的身份证。
    国民党“公使馆”官员命令前来示威的华侨青年把他们的侨民登记证交给南越当局。示威群众质问，如果这样做，华侨在5月9日以后怎么办。示威群众的情绪愈来愈激昂，他们冲进了“公使馆”，捣毁了办公室。国民党分子召来了大批南越武装警察，强制驱散示威群众。在这次事件中，有华侨多人受伤。
    南越当局早在去年8月就开始命令土生华侨登记入越南籍。但是这项法令受到数十万华侨的普遍抵制。南越当局后来又在今年3月间命令华侨总登记，但是禁止土生华侨参加这次登记。国民党“公使馆”在4月28日发表声明，表示同意南越当局要华侨总登记，不过它主张“应准许土生华侨一并参加总登记”。国民党“公使馆”的这种立场，激起华侨的愤怒。4月30日，数百名华侨到“公使馆”示威，要求制止南越当局强迫华侨入越南籍。他们激于义愤，打坏了“公使馆”的门窗和家具。赶来镇压的南越武装警察曾经逮捕两名华侨青年。
    随着规定土生华侨加入越南籍的期限的临近，南越各省当局正在加紧强制华侨办理改变国籍和参加总登记的手续，有的地方甚至收回了土生华侨的居留证。南越各地华侨人心惶惶，许多人正在设法离开南越。
    据西方通讯社报道，美国方面很注意这件事，并且可能在吴庭艳访问华盛顿的时候加以讨论。
