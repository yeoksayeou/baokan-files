    Why is Employee Housing So Tight?
    -- An Investigation of Employee Housing Problems at the State-Owned Zhengzhou Textile Machinery Factory
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Tu Xiaofang, Liu Jiansheng
    Currently, in many newly built state-owned factories and mines, there are cries about the shortage of employee housing. How is the construction of employee housing actually progressing? Reporters conducted some investigations on this issue at the State-Owned Zhengzhou Textile Machinery Factory.
    The State-Owned Zhengzhou Textile Machinery Factory currently has 3,955 employees and is a relatively large factory built after liberation. Since its completion in 1951, except for 1955, this factory has expanded employee housing every year, and is continuing to expand this year. However, up to now, the housing problem for employees has not been fully resolved, and employees have many opinions on this, believing that the administrative leadership department is not concerned enough about the hardships of employees.
    We obtained the following materials from the factory's basic construction section: Since the factory was built, it has constructed a total of 50,659 square meters of employee housing, of which 39,361 square meters are family housing, and 11,298 square meters are dormitory housing. If these dormitories were evenly distributed to all current employees of the factory, each person could receive 12.8 square meters of dormitory area.
    Since its construction, the factory has invested 3,109,000 yuan in the construction of employee housing, accounting for more than one-fifth of the total factory investment (including machinery and equipment). If we add the investment in employee welfare facilities (including the construction of clubs, kindergartens, classrooms, auditoriums, nutrition canteens, etc., totaling 6,875.39 square meters) of more than 600,000 yuan, the total non-production construction investment accounts for more than 25% of the total factory construction investment. The non-production construction area is 23.43% larger than the production construction area.
    This factory has built so much employee housing, so why are employees still complaining that there is not enough housing? According to our investigation, the main problems are as follows:
    (1) The allocation of employee housing is unreasonable. Currently, there are 1,068 households of employees living in family housing in this factory, totaling 4,490 people (employees and their families), occupying a dormitory area of more than 34,000 square meters; on average, each person occupies nearly eight square meters, and each household occupies nearly thirty-two square meters. There are 2,354 employees living in dormitory housing, occupying a dormitory area of 11,298 square meters, with an average of more than 4.8 square meters per employee. This statistic shows that the factory's dormitory housing is already very spacious, while the dormitory area occupied by employees' families is too large.
    (2) Those who shouldn't be living there are living there. Currently, the shortage of employee housing is mainly due to the lack of family housing. However, what kind of employees and their families are living in family housing?
    Last year, more than 700 employees applied for family housing. However, the family housing newly built by the factory last year could only accommodate 152 households. The factory selected the most urgent cases from these 700 applicants and allocated housing to them. We conducted investigations and analysis on these 152 households with the most urgent need for housing.
    I. 80 households fell under the following categories and could be allocated family housing:
    1. Family members from other provinces who originally lived in cities and relied on employees for living expenses;
    2. Couples who both work in the factory;
    3. Employees transferred from other factories whose family members lived in family housing in the original factory;
    4. Family members who are in the same province or city but have no home or job;
    5. Returned overseas Chinese with family members;
    6. Elderly employees whose parents have no one to take care of them at home.
    II. 68 households fell under the following categories and could be denied family housing:
    1. Those who originally lived in the city or in the surrounding rural areas;
    2. Family members who originally lived in rural areas of the province and can participate in productive labor;
    3. Family members whose residence is not far from the factory and employees can often visit home;
    4. Single people;
    5. Family members who blindly come to the city to find work;
    6. Non-direct relatives who have someone to take care of them in their original residence.
    III. 4 households fell under the following categories and could be either granted or denied family housing:
    1. Direct relatives who rely on workers for living expenses but live in rural areas;
    2. Families who have encountered natural disasters and have temporary housing difficulties;
    3. Houses that, although not in good condition, can be repaired and maintained.
    From this material, even among the employees whom the factory singled out as having the most urgent need to resolve their housing problems, a large proportion could be denied housing.
    In addition to employees' parents, wives, and children, non-direct relatives of employees, such as employees' nephews, nephews-in-law, cousins, nephews, sons-in-law, and even individual employees' friends, have long lived in family housing, which is not an isolated phenomenon. According to the factory's statistics, last year alone, there were 720 employee relatives who came to the factory from rural areas to find work. After these people arrived, only a few found jobs, and those who did not find jobs lived in family housing for a long time waiting for employment, thus further exacerbating the tight housing situation for employees.
    There is a saying circulating among the employees in this factory: "Whoever's family doesn't come is at a disadvantage." This saying is reasonable. The reason is that the factory's rent is too low. The best and largest houses (construction standard is more than 90 yuan per square meter, 46 square meters per household) cost 3.5 yuan per month per household, 36 square meters of housing costs 3 yuan, and 18 square meters costs 1.5 yuan. Workers feel that living in public housing is very cheap, and almost everyone can afford it. However, the factory loses a large amount of money every year on employee family housing. According to the factory's statistics, the annual depreciation and maintenance costs of employee housing are 145,000 yuan, while the total rent collected annually is only 35,000 yuan, resulting in a deficit of 110,000 yuan. In addition, the monthly water fee income is 500 yuan, but the actual monthly water fee paid to the water company is 2,000 yuan, so the factory needs to subsidize employee families with 18,000 yuan in water fees annually. In addition, employee family members enjoy half-price medical treatment, which the factory subsidizes with 8,146 yuan annually. In total, the factory needs to subsidize more than 136,000 yuan annually from the cost and administrative expenses. This expenditure accounts for more than 21% of the factory's profits turned over to the state in 1956. If this expenditure is averaged among the 1,068 households of employees currently living in family housing, each household needs the factory to subsidize more than 127 yuan annually. If we add the large amount of relief funds paid by the factory (because more employee family members come, causing financial difficulties for employees), it would be even more.
    Therefore, employee family members who should not come also come, and those who do not need to live in public housing also demand to live in public housing. According to our understanding, among the employees currently living in family housing, some employees originally lived in the city, rented out their own houses to others, and then moved into public housing. For example, Jing Yulin, an employee of this factory, has his own house and is less than half a mile away from the factory. He felt that his house was not as good as the newly built family housing of the factory, so he rented out his house and moved into the newly built employee family housing.
    The factory originally had some systems for the management of employee housing. There were standards and regulations for what kind of employees should live in family housing and what kind of employees should not. For example, the factory's regulations stipulate that only technical workers or workers above the fifth grade, or staff equivalent to fifth-grade workers, can live in family housing, and trainees generally cannot live in family housing, etc. However, these regulations have not been well implemented.
    How to solve the problem of insufficient employee housing? The factory has not yet conducted research. According to our understanding, the factory plans to expand another 2,800 square meters of family housing in the second half of this year. According to the factory's statistics, even if these dormitories are built, about 300 to 400 employees who have already applied for family housing will not be able to have their problems solved. We solicited some opinions from the masses in this regard, and they believe that it is worth considering whether the factory should continue to expand dormitories now. Some leading cadres in the factory believe that some of the employees who have not yet had their housing problems solved need to be solved, so more dormitories must be built. Others believe that even if the housing problems of these people who need housing now are solved, new needs will arise in the future, such as those who are not married wanting to get married, and those who have not had children wanting to have children. Unless the country does not engage in construction, the employee family housing problem cannot be completely solved at present.

    职工宿舍为什么紧张？
    ——对国营郑州纺织机械厂职工住宅问题的调查
    新华社记者　涂筱芳　刘健生
    目前，在许多新建的国营厂矿企业中，都在叫喊职工住宅紧张。究竟职工宿舍建设得怎么样？记者就这个问题，在国营郑州纺织机械厂作了一些调查。
    国营郑州纺织机械厂现有职工三千九百五十五人，是解放以后新建的规模比较大的一个工厂。这个厂建成以后，自1951年开始，除1955年以外，每年都扩建职工宿舍，今年还在继续扩建中。但是，直到现在，职工的住宅问题仍然没有全部解决，为此职工有很多意见，认为行政领导部门关心职工的疾苦不够。
    我们在这个厂的基本建设科获得了如下的材料：自建厂以来到现在为止，厂里共计已经建筑了五万零六百五十九平方公尺的职工宿舍，其中眷属宿舍是三万九千三百六十一平方公尺；集体宿舍是一万一千二百九十八平方公尺。这些宿舍如果平均分给全厂现有的职工，每人可以分到十二点八平方公尺的宿舍面积。
    这个厂自建厂以来，为建设职工宿舍投入的资金已达三百一十万九千元，占建厂总投资（包括机器设备在内）的五分之一以上。如果再加上职工福利设施（包括建设的俱乐部、幼儿园、教室、礼堂、营养食堂等共有六千八百七十五点三九平方公尺）投资的六十余万元，共计非生产性的建设投资占建厂总投资的25％多。非生产性的建筑面积比生产性的建筑面积多23.43％。
    这个工厂建设了这么多的职工宿舍，为什么职工还在喊房子不够呢？根据我们的调查，主要有如下几个问题：
    （一）职工宿舍分配得不合理。现在这个厂的职工，住在眷属宿舍的有一千零六十八户，共有四千四百九十人（职工本人和家属），占用宿舍面积三万四千多平方公尺；大小人平均每人占用近八平方公尺，平均每户占用近三十二平方公尺。住在集体宿舍的职工有二千三百五十四人，占用宿舍面积一万一千二百九十八平方公尺，平均每个职工占用四点八平方公尺以上。这个统计说明，这个厂的集体宿舍已经很宽裕，而职工眷属占用的宿舍面积就太多了。
    （二）不该住的住上了。目前职工宿舍紧张，主要是眷属宿舍不够用。但是，住眷属宿舍的都是些什么样的职工和眷属呢？
    去年申请解决眷属宿舍的职工有七百多人。但是去年厂里新建成的眷属宿舍，只能居住一百五十二户。厂里就从这七百申请户中，选择最迫切需要的分配了。我们就从这一百五十二户最迫切需要房子的职工中，作了调查和分析。
    一、属于下列情况可以解决眷属宿舍的有八十户：
    1，外省家属原住城市依靠职工生活者；
    2，夫妇双方都在本厂工作者；
    3，外厂调来职工，其家属在原厂就住家属宿舍者；
    4，家属虽在本省、市，但无家无业者；
    5，归国华侨有眷属者；
    6，年老的职工父母，家中无人照顾者。
    二、属于下列情况可以不解决的有六十八户：
    1，原在本市居住或四乡居住者；
    2，家属原住本省农村，并能参加生产劳动者；
    3，家属住地离厂不远，职工本人可以经常回家探望者；
    4，单身人；
    5，家属盲目进城市找工作者；
    6，非直系亲属原籍有人照顾者。
    三、属于下列情况可解决可不解决的有四户：
    1，依靠工人生活的直系亲属，但在农村居住者；
    2，家中遭遇自然灾害，住宅有临时困难者；
    3，原住房屋虽然不好，但可以修理维持者。
    从这个材料来看，就是厂里挑出的最迫切需要解决房子问题的职工中，可以不解决的也占很大比重。
    在眷属宿舍中居住的除了职工的父母、妻子和儿女以外，非直系的职工亲属，如职工的侄子、妻侄、表兄姊妹、外甥、女婿，甚至于还有个别的职工朋友等长期住在眷属宿舍里，也不是个别的现象。据这个厂的统计，去年单是由农村来厂找工作的职工亲属，就有七百二十人。这些人来了以后，其中只有很少几个人找到了职业，未找到职业的人就长期住在眷属宿舍里等待就业，因而，更加促成了职工宿舍的紧张情况。
    在这个厂里的职工中流传着这样一句话：“谁的家属不来，谁就吃亏”，这句话是有道理的。原因是厂里的房租太低，最好最大的房子（建筑标准是九十多元一平方公尺，一户住宅四十六平方公尺）每户一月房租费是三元五角，三十六平方公尺的宿舍是三元，十八平方公尺的是一元五角，工人感到住公房很便宜，差不多的都可以住得起。但是厂里却为职工眷属宿舍年年赔很大一批钱。据厂里的统计，每年职工宿舍的折旧费和维修费要开支十四万五千元，而每年收回的全部房租才有三万五千元，收支相抵亏十一万元。另外水费每月收入五百元，但实际每月要付给自来水公司水费二千元，这样全年厂里需要给职工家属补贴一万八千元的水费。再加上职工家属治病享受半价，全年厂里补贴八千一百四十六元。总计全年厂里要从成本费和行政费开支补贴十三万六千多元。这笔开支约占全厂1956年上缴利润的21％多。这笔开支如果按照现住家属宿舍的一千零六十八户职工来平均，每户职工每年需要厂里补贴一百二十七元多。如果再加上厂内付出的大批救济费（因为职工家属来的多了，造成职工生活困难），那就更多了。
    因此，职工家属不应该来的也来了，不需要住公房的也要求住公房。据我们了解，现住在眷属宿舍的职工中，还有些职工原在本市居住，而把自己的房子出租给别人以后，再迁入公房。如这个厂的职工荆玉林，自己有房子，而且离工厂不到半里地远，他感到自己的房子不如工厂新建的眷属宿舍好，因此，就把自己房子出租了，搬进厂里新建的职工眷属宿舍。
    厂里在职工宿舍的管理上本来是有些制度的。甚么样的职工该住眷属宿舍，甚么样的职工不该住是有标准和规定的。如这个厂里的规定是技术工人或五级以上的工人，相当于五级工人的职员才能住眷属宿舍，学员一般的不能住眷属宿舍等。但是，这些规定并没有很好地执行。
    如何来解决职工宿舍不够的问题？现在厂里还没有进行研究。据我们了解，厂里计划在今年下半年再扩建二千八百平方公尺的眷属宿舍。据厂里统计，就是再建这些宿舍，大约还有三、四百户已经申请解决眷属宿舍的职工不能解决。我们在这方面征求了一些群众的意见，他们认为现在厂里应该不应该再继续扩建宿舍，是值得考虑的。厂里有的领导干部认为，现在，在没有得到解决宿舍问题的职工中，有些人是需要解决的，因此，就得再建。也有的人认为，就是现在这些需要房子的人给解决了，以后也还会产生新的需要户，如未结婚的要结婚，未生孩子的要生孩子。除非国家不搞建设，否则目前职工眷属宿舍是无法统统解决的。
