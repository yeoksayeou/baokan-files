Xinhua News Agency, May 3rd. Xinhua News Agency reporter Lu Gongmin reports: Many people in Beijing have expressed opinions about the current insufficient supply of some commodities in the market. The reporter conducted an investigation into this with relevant departments in Beijing.

It is understood that since the launch of the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement, the supply of many commodities in Beijing has gradually eased. The sales of general office supplies, cultural and educational supplies, wooden furniture, and high-end consumer goods have all decreased to varying degrees. However, the supply of some commodities, especially some non-staple foods such as pork, vegetables, sugar, and pastries, remains tight. For example, the actual sales of pork last year were over 732,000 head, and the planned supply this year has increased to over 800,000 head. However, according to the current supply, only 60% of the demand can be met, so residents often have to queue up to buy it. In addition, the supply of pastries is insufficient because the supply of grain for the food industry has been reduced. Other items such as firewood, milk powder, toilet paper, and hemp fiber are also in short supply.

The fundamental reason for the tight supply of some commodities is that the growth rate of social purchasing power exceeds the growth rate of production, not that the supply has decreased. Last year, due to the increase in social purchasing power throughout the city, the sales of some major commodities exceeded the plan by a large margin. The sales volume of more than 20 major commodities, including grain, edible oil, cotton cloth, clothing, coal, pork, vegetables, cigarettes, tea, and sugar, increased compared with the previous year. Among them, cotton cloth increased by 47.4%, pork increased by 17.3%, and vegetables increased by 27.2%. In addition to the increase in population, the per capita supply of many commodities also increased.

Since last autumn, the state has spent more money on basic construction investment, wage increases, and agricultural loans. In addition, the rapid increase in Beijing's population and the delayed production time of some commodities such as vegetables due to seasonal factors have all had a certain impact on the insufficient supply of some commodities. In addition, there are many shortcomings in commercial work, mainly the inaccurate grasp of material supply plans. The supply of some major materials was once too loose, consuming too much inventory, and some materials were not actively purchased for fear of stockpiling. At the same time, the production, distribution, and allocation of commodities are uneven, creating artificial shortages and even out-of-stock situations. For example, the planned supply of sugar this year is higher than last year, but due to a lack of understanding and analysis of the sugar production season, market, and transportation conditions, sales were relaxed in January and February, resulting in the current tight supply. At the same time, untimely allocation from wholesale to retail departments has also caused out-of-stock phenomena in some areas.

At present, the Beijing Municipal People's Committee is urging and helping commercial departments to do their best to take all possible measures to alleviate and resolve the contradictions between market supply and demand. For vegetables, in addition to vigorously expanding vegetable production, the Vegetable Company is strengthening the purchase and transportation of vegetables from other places, and has increased the supply of mung beans and soybeans by 700,000 jin to expand the supply of tofu and bean sprouts. It is estimated that the tight supply of vegetables will be eased somewhat around mid-May. In order to increase the market supply of sugar, relevant departments are preparing to appropriately reduce the amount of sugar used for industrial purposes and try to maintain the market supply at last year's level. For grain used by industries, it is planned to maintain the current supply level, while the production of noodles, bread, biscuits, cakes, and other foods needed by the sick and children has been appropriately increased. The supply of firewood is very difficult due to the reduction of construction waste. We are now trying to strengthen procurement from both local and foreign sources to ensure supply.

The leading organs of Beijing also require commercial departments to strengthen market research, actively organize sources of goods, and should not cause out-of-stock situations for fear of stockpiling, or only purchase popular goods and cause incomplete varieties. In addition to supplying and rationally distributing some major commodities according to plan, actively promote commodities with sufficient sources of goods. Regarding the shortcomings of some stores that are not actively organizing sources of goods, reducing the variety of goods, and inconvenient sales procedures for the masses, relevant units are trying to correct them. At the same time, Beijing is also preparing to conduct extensive publicity and explanation to the general public about the actual situation of market supply, difficulties, and future improvement measures.

### 缓和与解决当前市场供求矛盾  北京市积极采取各种措施

    缓和与解决当前市场供求矛盾
    北京市积极采取各种措施
    新华社3日讯　新华社记者卢恭敏报道：北京市不少群众对目前市场上部分商品供应不足的情况提出意见，记者为此向北京市有关方面作了调查。
    据了解，自从增产节约运动开展以来，北京市许多商品的供应已经逐渐趋向缓和，一般办公用品、文化教育用品、木器和高级消费品的销量都有不同程度的下降。但是，还有一些商品，特别是某些副食品如猪肉、蔬菜、食糖、糕点等，供应仍很紧张。其中像猪肉去年实销七十三万二千多口，今年计划供应量增加到八十万口以上。但是按现在的供应量，只能满足需要量的60％，因而居民经常要排队购买。另外像糕点，由于压缩了对食品工业粮食的供应量，就不能充分供应。另外如劈柴、奶粉、卫生纸、麻刀等也都紧张。
    部分商品供应紧张的根本原因，是社会购买力增长的程度超过了生产增长的程度，并不是供应量减少了。去年全市由于社会购买力的提高，一些主要商品的销售都超过计划很多，粮食、食油、棉布、服装、煤炭、猪肉、蔬菜、纸烟、茶叶、食糖等二十多种主要商品的销售量，都比前年增加。其中棉布增加47.4％，猪肉增加17.3％，蔬菜增加27.2％。这些商品销量的增加除了人口增加的因素以外，不少商品的每人平均供应量也增加了。
    去年秋季以后，国家在基本建设投资、增加工资和农业贷款等方面都多花了些钱，加上北京市人口增加很快，有些商品如蔬菜因受季节影响生产时间推迟等，对于部分商品供应不足都有一定的影响。此外，商业工作上也存在着很多缺点，主要是对物资供应计划掌握得不准确，对有些主要物资一度供应偏宽，过多地消耗了库存力量，对有些物资由于怕积压不敢积极进货；同时，商品生产分配和调拨不均衡，造成人为的紧张，甚至脱销。例如，今年食糖计划供应量比去年增加，但由于对食糖生产季节、市场和运输情况缺乏了解分析，在一、二月份放宽了销售，因而造成目前的供应紧张。同时，由于从批发部门向零售部门调拨不及时，也造成了一些地区的脱销现象。
    目前，北京市人民委员会正在督促和帮助商业部门尽最大努力，采取一切可能的措施，缓和和解决市场供求矛盾。如对于蔬菜，除了大力扩大蔬菜的生产以外，蔬菜公司正在加强外地蔬菜的购运工作，并且增加了七十万斤绿豆、黄豆，扩大了豆腐、豆芽的供应量。估计5月中旬左右，蔬菜供应紧张的状况就可以缓和一些。为了增加食糖的市场供应，有关部门准备适当减少工业用糖，尽可能使市场供应量保持去年水平。对于行业用粮，准备保持目前的供应水平，而病人和小孩所需的挂面、面包、饼干、蛋糕等生产用粮则作了适当增加。劈柴供应因建筑废料减少有很大困难，现正在设法加强本市与外地的采购工作，以保证供应。
    北京市领导机关还要求商业部门加强对市场的调查研究工作，积极地组织货源，不应当怕积压而造成脱销，或光进畅销货而造成品种不全。除了对一些主要商品要按计划供应、合理分配外，对货源充足的商品要积极推销。目前有些商店发生的不积极组织货源、商品品种减少、售货手续不便利群众等缺点，有关单位正在设法纠正。同时北京市还准备把市场供应的实际情况、困难和今后改进的办法向广大群众进行广泛的宣传解释工作。
