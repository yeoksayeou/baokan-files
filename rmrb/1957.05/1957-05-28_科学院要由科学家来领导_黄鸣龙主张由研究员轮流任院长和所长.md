The Academy of Sciences Should Be Led by Scientists
Huang Minglong Advocates Researchers Taking Turns as President and Institute Directors

Regarding the leadership of the Academy of Sciences, Huang Minglong, a member of the Department of Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry, suggested that scientific research personnel should be the main body, with researchers taking turns serving as president and institute directors. He said, "If possible, the scientific administrative leadership of the Academy and various institutes should return to the scientific route." Although the leaders of scientific administration do not directly lead scientific work, it is still necessary for genuine scientific workers who have not deviated from the scientific route to take on these roles (as is the case in Europe and America, including the Soviet Union). He hopes that "President Guo, like Chairman Mao's recent strong call during the rectification movement, will lead cadres to return to their posts and participate in labor."

Huang Minglong believes that the hierarchy in the Academy of Sciences is strict, with "leaders" being valued above all else, not the talent of researchers. He said, "Currently, in the Academy of Sciences, not only the highest scientific administrative leaders, but also some institute directors and deputy directors, have not been doing research work for many years, and even for many years have been unable to read scientific reports from various countries. I am deeply afraid that, seeing that many people in the Academy seek fame and position through qualifications or social activities, rather than being respected for their talent and research achievements, and also that the Academy does not require research work, they will be content with the position of 'leader,' hoping to gradually increase their qualifications, while also enjoying social activities to seek fame. If this phenomenon and atmosphere persist for a long time, how can we hope to improve our scientific level and how can we march towards science! Therefore," he proposed to the Academy: "Do not value 'leaders' above all else; research achievements must be emphasized, and talent should be valued over seniority. It is best to restore the previous regulations, that is, researchers should be the main body, and only researchers can also serve as institute directors or presidents (if 'leader' is not considered superior, in fact, associate researchers can also be institute directors). It is best to follow the previous practice of German universities (I don't know how it is now in various places), that is, professors are respected in universities, and the president is rotated among the professors, with a term of three years."

"Levels must be based on genuine talent and solid research achievements, and never on qualifications." Huang Minglong said, "Currently, the levels of various researchers and 'leaders' in the Academy are mostly determined based on qualifications or false reputations, or reportedly assessed by the Academy's administrative leaders, and not truly based on genuine talent and solid research achievements. To know genuine talent, we must follow the mass line, because the talent and research achievements of scientific workers are clearest to the masses who are with him."

Huang Minglong believes that we should forgive the various mistakes and deviations that occur in some institutions with positions but no power. However, in the Chinese Academy of Sciences, I find it quite puzzling. As far as I know (perhaps too subjectively), the Party and government have great trust in the Academy of Sciences, and the Party leadership does not want dictatorship. But as a result, the Academy still cannot avoid dogmatism and bureaucracy, and all deviations that hinder scientific progress have not been avoided. For example, in the past, they did not pay attention to improving the scientific level, did not know how to catch up, but emphasized imitation, and have always failed to overcome formalism, causing scientists to spend countless precious time attending unfeasible meetings and making countless plans that cannot be followed or are not accurate (because time, personnel, tools, and funding cannot be controlled). For example, last year, the Academy actually ordered us to complete the draft of the twelve-year science plan in a few days (later extended by the State Council for a few months). I immediately shouted that we could not be so sloppy, but the Academy turned a deaf ear. Also, in the academic circles after liberation, there was a one-sided deviation. Although Premier Zhou and Vice Premier Chen clearly stated at the first meeting of the academic departments that learning should not be one-sided, some measures of the Academy still inevitably fell dogmatically to one side. For example, the recently issued provisional regulations on domestic graduate students by the Academy still contain the provision that learning foreign languages should prioritize Russian. I think that even students who have done experiments in the laboratory, not to mention those who have taken the route of experimental scientific research, know that doing experiments requires referring to literature, and most of those are written in English or German." He said, "The above-mentioned deviations can be forgiven if they come from cadres who do not understand science, but it is really puzzling that they come from natural science administrative leaders with positions and power who can easily make suggestions and correct deviations to the Party and government and who have taken the scientific route. I dare not say whether they are knowingly and intentionally catering to me, but I think I can always take this to advise and encourage myself. If you feel that my suggestions and criticisms are unreasonable or too subjective, please do not regard them as malicious or as complaints."

    科学院要由科学家来领导
    黄鸣龙主张由研究员轮流任院长和所长
    关于科学院的领导问题，数学物理学化学部委员黄鸣龙建议应以科学研究人员为主体，由研究员轮流担任院长和所长。他说“院方和各个所方的科学行政领导如果可能的话最好再走上科学路线。”科学行政的领导虽然并不领导科学工作，但是仍然需要真正的未脱离科学路线的科学工作者来担任（欧美包括苏联都是如此）。他希望“郭院长像毛主席最近在整风运动中大力号召，领导干部归队参加劳动”。
    黄鸣龙认为，科学院中阶层森严，以“长”为贵，不以研究人员才力为尊。他说，“现在科学院中不但最高科学行政领导，就是各所内若干所长副所长也是因为多年不做研究工作甚而至于多年不能阅读各国的科学报告。我深恐他们鉴于院内甚多以资格或社会活动求得名位，并非以才力及研究成绩而受尊崇，同时院中也不要求做研究工作，于是便安于“长”的位置，可希逐渐增高资格，一方面也乐于社会活动，借以求名。这种现象和风气如果长期存在的话，我们如何能有希望提高科学水平，如何能向科学进军！因此，他向院方提出建议：“万勿以‘长’为尊，必须以研究成绩为重，勿以老资格而应以才力为贵。最好恢复从前的条例，即以研究员为主体，研究员才可兼所长或院长（如不以‘长’为高，其实副研究员亦可当所长。）最好照从前德国各大学的办法（现在各地如何不得而知），即大学中以教授为尊，至若校长是各教授轮流兼任的，任期三年。”
    “级别须以真才实学研究成绩为标准，万勿以资格为高低”。黄鸣龙说，“现在院中各研究人员及‘长’的级别大都根据资格或虚名，或传说由院中行政领导评定，并非真正地以真才实学研究成绩为标准。欲知真才实学须走群众路线，因为科学工作者的才力及研究成绩同他在一处的群众最为清楚。”
    黄鸣龙认为，在若干有职无权的机构发生种种错误与偏差，我们应当原谅。但是在中国科学院我觉得颇有令人难解之处，据我所知（也许太主观）党政对科学院极为信任，党领导并不要专政。但结果院中仍不免教条主义、官僚主义，所有防碍科学进展的偏差一律未能避免。例如从前不注重提高科学水平，不晓得迎头赶上而重视仿造，又一向不知克服形式主义，致使科学家费去无数的宝贵时间参加不可实行的会议，做了无数的不能照做不能准确的计划（因为时间、人员、工具、经费都不能掌握）。又如去年院中竟限令我们几天内完成十二年科学计划草案（到后来才由国务院延长几个月），我当时即大声疾呼不可如此马虎行事，但院中置若罔闻。又在解放后学术界有一面倒的偏差，虽然周总理及陈副总理在第一次学部会议上很明显地表示学习不能一面倒，但是本院若干措施仍不免教条式地倒在一边。例如最近本院发出的国内研究生的暂行条例上仍载有学习外文以俄文为必要的规定，我想不要说曾走上实验科学研究路线的人，就连在实验室中做过实验的学生，都晓得做实验非参考文献不可，而那些大都是用英文或德文写的。”他说，“上述种种偏差出之于不懂科学的干部尚可原谅，但是出之于有职有权的极易向党政建议及纠正偏差的曾走上过科学路线的自然科学行政领导人员，实在令人难解，是不是明知故眜一意迎合我不敢断言，不过我想我总可以拿此来相劝勉。假如觉得我的建议和批评有不合理和太主观的地方，请勿视为恶意或认为牢骚。”
