Flowers in the Parade
By Our Correspondent

	Street Discussions About Rectification
	Before the parade began, people were discussing the rectification movement everywhere in the streets and alleys. In front of Tiananmen Square, two People's Liberation Army officers, leaning on the stone railings of the Jinshui Bridge, were talking with great interest.
	Colonel: "The Party's decision becomes more important the more I think about it. I haven't held a hoe in almost ten years since entering the city, and my feelings for the common people have become estranged. But I worked as a farmhand for twenty years, and the landlord kicked me out!"
	Major: "How intimate that life of both production and study was back in Yan'an! Can we do that now? That would truly be a combination of physical and mental labor!"
	Colonel: (Lightly but forcefully) "It is really meaningful that the Party announced this decision on 'May Day' Labor Day. Let's start from today! Let our hands and brains work together!"

	Wearing the Clothes Worn at the Red Square Ceremony
	In the workers' contingent of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, the old foreman Song Yulin, who had lived by the blast furnace for nineteen years, and his assistant, the young deputy foreman Liu Xiaozhen, took turns carrying charts of the pig iron production plan that had been overfulfilled. Gu Yonglin, a twenty-one-year-old female team leader from the Beijing Electronic Tube Factory, and her female companions, kept shouting "Long live Sino-Soviet friendship!" and "Long live Chairman Voroshilov!" to the rostrum. Gu Yonglin had interned at a light bulb factory in Moscow. She participated in mass parades in Red Square twice and saw Chairman Voroshilov. Yesterday, she specially wore the blue Lenin suit she wore when watching the ceremony in Red Square, and wore a commemorative medal with the Kremlin pattern given by Soviet friends, to see Chairman Voroshilov.

	"Chairman Mao's Health is Better Than it Was Twenty Years Ago"
	Old guerrillas Wu Chengye and old militia member Li Wenduo from the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region appeared in the parade. They came to visit the Agricultural Exhibition. A small flag blocked Wu Chengye's view. He shouted, "The flag is raised too high." He bent down and looked at the Tiananmen Gate Tower. As he passed the West Huabiao, he kept looking, pulling the person next to him and saying, "I see it, I see it!" When he realized he was pulling a stranger, he found that he was more than ten feet behind the team. He ran forward and found Li Wenduo. Before he could speak, Li Wenduo preemptively said, "Chairman Mao's health is better than when I first saw him more than twenty years ago!"

	The Weather Workers' Balloons
	The parade contingent of national advanced meteorological workers arrived at Tiananmen Square. The girls and boys, dressed in festive costumes, held white and red balloons. In the thousands of mountains and valleys, in the distant frontiers, and on the endless grasslands, they used balloons and other instruments day and night to measure the ever-changing climate, temperature, and wind direction for the needs of the country's economic construction. Their hard work and selfless labor brought them to the capital to participate in the conference of advanced workers. Yesterday, in the capital, in front of Tiananmen Square, in front of Chairman Mao and Chairman Voroshilov, they excitedly released the balloons in their hands. This time, the slowly rising balloons were not used for measurement, but to celebrate their own festival...

	Flowers Blooming in "Hundred Flowers Lane"
	The garden-style street north of East Chang'an Street is the location of the cultural army, and it seems like a "Hundred Flowers Lane." Those actors and actresses in gorgeous national costumes are the most dazzling flowers in the flowerbeds. A group of foreign photographers surrounded them, hunting for the most beautiful shots. In front of the Children's Cinema, gongs, cymbals, drums, and sheng, guan, di, and xiao instruments sounded together, and the folk band played lyrical folk music. The athletes of the lion dance team conducted a final practice in front of the Youth Art Theater. The crowds of people who came to watch in this wonderful "Hundred Flowers Lane" added some "difficulties" to the staff maintaining order at the intersection. Seeing that "Hundred Flowers Lane" was about to be crowded, Ren Tanghui from "San Cha Kou", Sun Wukong from "Havoc in Heaven", and the Dragon Girl all came to support these staff, but it was to no avail. Finally, the big painted face stepped forward and shouted, and everyone calmed down.

	"Chinese-Style" Capitalists
	Li Zhiqiang, deputy director of the No. 1 Glass Factory, said that our mood for participating in the parade this year is different from previous years because we feel that the status of the industrial and commercial circles is different.

	Li Zhiqiang said that a few days ago, Comrade Voroshilov went to Tianjin, embraced and kissed Wang Guangying, vice chairman of the Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce. Comrade Voroshilov also said that he would tell the Soviet people when he returned that he had kissed a Chinese capitalist. These things make us feel that it is a great honor to be a "Chinese-style" capitalist in the era of Mao Zedong.

	Li Zhiqiang also said that we have now become state public officials. We march behind the workers' contingent, and we are striving to become true members of the working class.

	"Peaceful Consultation" to Resolve Conflicts
	The student contingent of the Central Academy of Arts and Crafts walked at the forefront of the cultural army yesterday. While people were still resting, these future artists showed their love for learning. They held paper and pens and sketched countless colorful scenes. A student surnamed Wang was engrossed in depicting the image of a Mongolian girl wearing colorful clothes, but suddenly the girl turned around as if she had realized something. Wang was in a state of surprise and embarrassment. A student from the Nationalities Institute came over and said: Ethnic minorities have a custom, that is, you must get her consent before you can paint her. Wang immediately went over to shake hands with the girl and explain his request, and the girl gladly agreed. After he finished painting, he humorously said to his friend: It seems that "peaceful consultation" is indeed a good way to resolve contradictions among the people.

    游行队伍里的花朵
    本报记者
    街头巷尾谈整风
    游行开始以前，街头巷尾人们到处谈论整风，在天安门前，两个人民解放军军官手扶着金水桥的石栏杆，谈得很有味。
    上校：“党这个决定，越想越重要，我进城快十年没拿镢头了，和老百姓的感情也疏远了；我可是干了二十年长工，叫地主老爷把我赶出来的！”
    少校：“我们当年在延安那种边生产边学习的生活，现在回想起来多么亲切！我们现在也可以那样做？那才真是体力劳动和脑力劳动相结合呢！”
    上校：（轻而有力地说）党在“五一”劳动节公布这个决定，真有意义。让我们从今天开始吧！让我们的手和脑子一齐动起来！”
    穿上在红场观礼的衣服
    石景山钢铁厂的工人队伍中，在高炉旁生活了十九年的老工长宋玉林和他的助手——年轻的副工长刘晓侦交替地抬着超额完成生铁产量计划的图表。北京电子管厂二十一岁的女工段长顾永霖和她的女伴们，不断向主席台高呼“中苏友好万岁！”“伏罗希洛夫主席万岁！”顾永霖曾在莫斯科灯泡工厂实习过，她两次在红场参加群众游行，看见过伏罗希洛夫主席。昨天，她特地穿着当年在红场观礼时穿的那件蓝色列宁服上装，挂着苏联友人送的镌有克里姆林宫图案的纪念章，来看伏罗希洛夫主席。
    “毛主席的身体比二十年前还好啊”
    游行行列里出现了陕甘宁边区的老游击队员吴成业和老自卫队员李文多。他们是来参观农业展览会的。一面小旗挡住了吴成业的视线，他一面叫着：“旗子举得太高了。”一面弯下腰，瞧着天安门城楼。走过西华表，他还看着，一面拉着他旁边的人说：“看到了，看到了！”等到他看清拉着的是陌生人时，才发觉他已经落在队伍后面一丈多远了。他奔到前面找到了李文多，正要开口，李文多却抢先说了：“毛主席的身体，比我在二十多年前第一次看到时还要好啊！”
    气象工作者的气球
    全国气象先进工作者的游行队伍来到了天安门，姑娘和小伙子们穿着节日的盛装，拿着白、红两色的气球。他们在千山万岭中、在遥远的边疆、在一望无际的草原上，为着祖国经济建设的需要，日夜不停地利用气球和其它仪器，测量着千变万化的气候、温度、风向等。辛勤和忘我的劳动，使他们来到了首都参加了先进工作者的会议。昨天，就在首都、在天安门前、在毛主席和伏罗希洛夫主席面前，他们兴奋地放起了手中的气球，这次，冉冉上升的气球已不是用作测量，而是为了庆祝自己的节日……。
    “百花巷”中花儿朵朵开
    东长安街北边的花园式街道，是文艺大军的所在地，这里好像是一条“百花巷”。那些身着瑰丽的各民族服装的演员们，是百花丛中最令人耀眼欲眩的花朵，一群外国摄影记者包围着他们，猎取最美的镜头。儿童电影院前面锣、铙、大鼓和笙、管、笛、箫齐鸣，民乐队吹奏起抒情的民间乐曲。舞狮队的健儿们在青年艺术剧院门前作了最后的观摩练习。在这条美妙的“百花巷”来观看的群众，人山人海，给在路口维持秩序的工作人员增加了一些“困难”。眼看着要把“百花巷”挤倒了。手持棍棒刀枪的“三叉口”里的任堂惠、“闹天宫”里的孙悟空和龙女都来支援这些工作人员，也无济于事。最后，大花脸上前?喝一声，大家才安静下来。
    “中国式”的资本家
    玻璃第一厂副厂长李志强说，今年我们参加游行的心情和往年不一样，因为我们感觉到工商界的地位不同了。
    李志强说，前几天伏老到天津，拥抱和亲吻了天津市工商联副主席王光英，伏老还说，将来回去要告诉苏联人民，他吻过中国的资本家。这些事情使我们感觉到作为一个毛泽东时代的“中国式”的资本家是非常光荣的。
    李志强还说，现在我们都已经成为国家的公职人员，我们游行就走在工人队伍的后面，我们正在争取成为真正的工人阶级的成员。
   “和平协商”解决矛盾
    中央工艺美术学院的学生队伍，昨天走在文艺大军的最前面，当人们还在休息的时候，这些未来的美术家表现了爱学不倦的精神。他们手拿纸笔对着无数鲜艳的镜头速写。一个姓王的同学正在津津有味地描绘一个穿着五颜十色衣裳的蒙族姑娘的形象，但是顿时间姑娘若有所悟地扭身走了，王同学当时处于一种惊奇和尴尬的境地。一个民族学院的学生走过来说：少数民族有一个习惯，那就是要得到她的同意你才能画她。王同学立即过去和姑娘握手并说明要求，姑娘这才欣然地答应了。当他画完后，幽默地对他的朋友说：看来“和平协商”真是解决人民内部矛盾的好办法。
