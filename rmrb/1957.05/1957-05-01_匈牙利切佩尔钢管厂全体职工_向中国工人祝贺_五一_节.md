The entire staff of the Csepel Steel Pipe Factory in Budapest, Hungary, sent a telegram to this newspaper on the 27th to congratulate Chinese workers on International Labor Day, May Day. The telegram reads: Dear Comrades:

Last October, the broad working people of our country were in the most difficult situation. The counter-revolutionaries who provoked the riots on October 23, 1956, attempted to replace the people's democratic system with a bourgeois dictatorship. With the help of the Soviet Union, we repelled the counter-revolutionary offensive and consolidated the workers' regime through tenacious labor. The vast majority of our people recognize that capitalism is a thing of the past, and the present and future belong to socialism. However, there are still some people among our people who are taking a reserved attitude. Therefore, we attach great importance to enlightening and educating them so that they support the people's regime. This is our most important task at present. Now we have overcome the great disaster. Although our future path is tortuous, victory will surely belong to the Hungarian people due to the correct leadership of the Party and the government, the vigorous efforts of our people, and the help of fraternal countries, especially the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. Experience has proven that only the ever-growing consolidation of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union can guarantee the victory of socialist construction. The great fraternal Chinese people have given us tremendous help in overcoming political and economic difficulties. Comrade Zhou Enlai's report at the Budapest Activists Conference held by the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party in January left a particularly deep impression on us and the entire Hungarian working class. The Hungarian people sincerely thank the fraternal Chinese people for their help. Now our national working people are preparing to celebrate the thirteenth free May Day. We resolutely support socialist construction and proletarian internationalism. We are deeply convinced that only under the leadership of a party armed with Marxism-Leninism can our motherland be built into a socialist country. On the occasion of May Day, we sincerely congratulate Comrade Mao Zedong, the wise leader of the Chinese people!

Long live the eternal fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Hungarian people!

    匈牙利切佩尔钢管厂全体职工
    向中国工人祝贺“五一”节
    本报讯  匈牙利首都布达佩斯的切佩尔钢管厂全体职工27日打电报给本报，向中国工人祝贺“五一”国际劳动节。电文如下：亲爱的同志们：
    我们祖国的广大劳动人民在去年10月曾处于最困难的境地。1956年10月23日挑起暴乱的反革命分子，企图以资产阶级专政来代替人民民主制度。我们在苏联的帮助下击退了反革命的进攻，并且用顽强的劳动来巩固工人政权。我们人民的极大部分都认识到资本主义已成过去，现在和未来都属于社会主义。但在我们人民中间还有一部分人采取着保留的态度，因而我们十分重视对他们的启发和教育，使他们拥护人民政权，这就是我们目前最重要的任务。现在我们已经渡过了巨大的灾难，虽然我们未来的道路是曲折的，但是由于党和政府的正确领导，我们人民的奋发努力，以及兄弟国家，首先是苏联和中华人民共和国的帮助，胜利必然属于我们匈牙利人民。经验证明：唯有以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的日益巩固，才能保证社会主义建设的胜利。伟大的兄弟般的中国人民在我们克服政治上和经济上的困难时，给了我们巨大的帮助。周恩来同志在匈牙利社会主义工人党1月间所举行的布达佩斯积极分子大会上的报告，给我们和整个匈牙利工人阶级留下特别深刻的印象。匈牙利人民衷心感谢兄弟般的中国人民所给予我们的帮助。现在我们全国劳动人民都在准备庆祝第十三次自由的“五一”节，我们坚决拥护社会主义的建设，拥护无产阶级国际主义，我们深信：只有在马克思列宁主义武装起来的政党的领导下，才能把我们的祖国建成一个社会主义的国家。在“五一”节之际，我们衷心地向中国人民的英明领袖毛泽东同志祝贺！
    中匈人民永远的兄弟般的友谊万岁！
        切佩尔钢管厂全体职工
                        4月27日
