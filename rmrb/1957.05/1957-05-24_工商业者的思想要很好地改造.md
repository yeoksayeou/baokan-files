The two speeches by Chairman Mao at the Supreme State Conference and the Propaganda Work Conference have given us a deeper understanding of the correct handling of contradictions among the people. Chairman Mao's instruction encourages us, industrialists and businessmen, to unite more closely around the Party, actively accept socialist transformation, and transform ourselves into self-reliant laborers as quickly as possible.

**The Ideological Remolding of Industrialists and Businessmen Lags Behind Changes in Social Status**

Our country is currently in a period of great social change. After fundamental changes have taken place in the relations of production, contradictions among the people also come from all aspects. As industrialists and businessmen, due to the duality brought about by class essence and the incomplete and insufficient ideological education, the remolding of ideology and consciousness lagging behind the change in social status is increasingly exposed. Such a contradiction also poses new challenges to our future ideological education work.

What is the current ideological situation of industrialists and businessmen? Based on our incomplete understanding, let us talk about the situation in Lushun-Dalian.

Since the implementation of the joint state-private ownership of all trades, most industrialists and businessmen have made varying degrees of progress in their work and study under the appeal of the Party's policy of redemption. The vast majority of industrialists and businessmen have participated in socialist competitions, exerted their technical and management talents, and many have been rated as advanced producers and advanced workers. In terms of political theory study, everyone has also received enlightenment and education of "destroying capitalism and establishing socialism," which has improved their political awareness and clarified their future. This is the positive side and also the main aspect. However, unhealthy phenomena, which is the negative side, continue to arise among industrialists and businessmen, specifically manifested in the following aspects:

**There are Still Many Negative Thoughts and Behaviors in the Business Community**

I. Some people have a slack mood and the idea of being a temporary guest. Some people think that "dividends are fixed, personnel arrangements are completed, wages are retained, the enterprise has public leadership, good or bad has nothing to do with me." "Regardless of whether the enterprise makes a profit or loss, anyway, my five percent fixed interest will not be affected." Therefore, they muddle through and are perfunctory, not as concerned about the joint venture enterprise as they were about their own enterprise in the past. Some also say: "The superiors call for more, faster, better, and more economical, and we also want more, faster, better, and more economical, which is: earn more money, get off work quickly, have good treatment, and save effort." Some people think that going to work on time, getting off work on time, and doing things according to the system means fulfilling their duties. A private sector employee in charge of purchasing said, "It doesn't matter whether it's expensive or cheap to buy things for the company, anyway, I can get reimbursed with an invoice." The purpose of some individuals striving to be advanced workers is purely to win awards; they will work if they can get an award, but they will not work if they cannot get an award, and they are dissatisfied if they are only praised but not given material rewards. Some people say, "Work should be done on the edge of the knife, not on the back of the knife; only do what you can see, and don't do what you can't see."

II. There are still doubts about the superiority of socialism, and there are ideological emotions of nostalgia for capitalism. Some people mistakenly view certain shortcomings in the production and operation of joint ventures and the current situation of tight supplies and insufficient supply of non-staple foods as being brought about by the socialist system. Some people are unwilling to abide by the enterprise's production, financial, and material supply plans, believing that it is not as free and arbitrary as when they were running their own business. Some show nostalgia for the capitalist business methods and decadent life of eating, drinking, playing, and having fun when they could have the final say, and be free and casual. As a result, they express dissatisfaction with real life, and negative emotions follow, and even violate the law, embezzling and stealing state assets to satisfy personal desires. After the opening of the free market, some people saw that there was a large profit to be made in the free market, and they became envious and jealous, thinking that "since there is today, why bother in the first place," and their determination to take the socialist road wavered. Some even openly proposed to withdraw from the joint venture enterprise and return to the old road of capitalism.

III. Arrogance, complacency, and neglect of self-remolding. After the joint ownership of all trades, some people only see the progress and positive side of themselves, but do not see the negative side. Some people think that the duality of the bourgeoisie no longer exists. They say, "The idea of fame and fortune exists in everyone; cadres and workers also care about fame and fortune, and workers and peasants also engage in commercial speculation in the market. If this is called duality, then the working class, the peasant class, and the bourgeoisie all have duality." Some people think that they have culture and technology, so they always regard themselves as wealthy and look down on the public sector and employees. They think, "The public sector is not as good as me in terms of technology, and I am more cultured than the workers." Therefore, they cannot accept the leadership of the public sector and get close to the masses of employees. Some private individuals distrust each other, suspect each other, intrigue, and fight for fame and profit. Some do not help and welcome the progress of others; on the contrary, when they see others making progress, they satirize and attack them; when they see others making mistakes, they do not sincerely help them, but hold a gloating attitude, thinking that the backwardness and mistakes of others show their own progress and brilliance.

From the above-mentioned contradictions alone, although it is not the ideological mainstream of industrialists and businessmen in Lushun-Dalian, it does hinder the efforts of industrialists and businessmen in contributing to the increase production and economize movement and self-remolding. Therefore, measures must be taken to strengthen ideological leadership and ideological education for industrialists and businessmen.

**The Party's Concern and Care for Industrialists and Businessmen**

In recent years, the Party and the government have always attached great importance to and cared for the ideological remolding of industrialists and businessmen, and have created favorable conditions for the study and remolding of industrialists and businessmen in many ways. For example, the fixed interest rate remains unchanged for seven years, allowing us to work, study, and remold with peace of mind for a longer period; various levels of socialist political schools and training courses have been held to allow us to study full-time, and so on. This all demonstrates the Party's meticulous care and concern for industrialists and businessmen, making us feel how honored and warm we are as industrialists and businessmen in a new China. However, there are not no problems in the ideological remolding of industrialists and businessmen. According to our understanding, some people do not pay enough attention to the important significance of industrialists and businessmen taking the enterprise as a base and carrying out ideological remolding through business practice. Some enterprises focus on production and operation and do not pay much attention to the ideology and progress of private sector personnel, regarding the activities of the Democratic National Construction Association and the Federation of Industry and Commerce as troublesome, and the learning and meetings of private sector personnel as a burden. Some production cooperative members do not receive wages for participating in the Federation of Industry and Commerce representative congress, and there is insufficient mutual coordination and support.

**An Example of Party Organizations Supporting the Work of the Democratic National Construction Association and the Federation of Industry and Commerce**

We deeply realize that whenever the leaders of an enterprise attach importance to the ideological education of private sector personnel and can support the work of the Democratic National Construction Association and the Federation of Industry and Commerce, they can mobilize the enthusiasm of private sector personnel, turn negativity into positivity, and enable private sector personnel to make contributions and accept remolding in their work. For example, in the Lushun-Dalian Cotton Weaving Factory, because the enterprise's Party committee has always been concerned about the ideological remolding of private sector personnel and attached importance to the association activities of the Democratic National Construction Association's enterprise branch, it consults and studies with the person in charge of the Democratic National Construction Association branch in advance for each relevant business meeting, so that the ideology is consistent and the steps are consistent, which encourages the enthusiasm of the Democratic National Construction Association members. In the past, the ideological situation of private sector personnel was relatively chaotic. When some private sector personnel were in the private sector, they would personally tighten the lint to produce more cloth, but after the joint venture, they knew that the lint was loose, but pretended not to know, fearing that it would cause dissatisfaction among the workers, which would be detrimental to them. When they heard that the enterprise was losing cotton yarn and wasting parts, and that the attendance rate of workers was not high, they thought that the joint venture system did not have superiority, so their emotions were negative. After discovering this situation, the enterprise Party committee promptly made arrangements to the Democratic National Construction Association branch and instructed the Democratic National Construction Association branch to hold an enlarged meeting of members, analyzing and studying the ideological situation of private sector personnel. Under the leadership and support of the public sector representatives, an inspection team was formed to go deep into the workshops to check the phenomenon of waste and existing problems. As a result of the inspection, more than 2,000 bundles of cotton were found outside the accounts, machine parts were sufficient for half a year, as well as labor discipline issues, which aroused the attention of the enterprise Party committee and private sector representatives. A general meeting of all private sector personnel was convened in the name of the industry trade union, and the problems found in the inspection were analyzed and criticized, and a report was made on running the enterprise as a family and running the enterprise thriftily. Public sector representatives also made suggestions at the meeting. After the meeting, the members of the Democratic National Construction Association were used as the backbone to form discussion groups. Through the education of this fact, the private sector personnel, who accounted for 80% of the workshop management cadres, all checked and criticized their own vague understanding and dependence. Many people formulated personal guarantee conditions for increasing production and saving money, and put forward many rationalization proposals, the value of which could be calculated to be tens of thousands of yuan. This action not only made contributions to the country, but also deeply educated and encouraged the private sector personnel to be dutiful and accept the confidence of remolding, making the workshops that were very chaotic in the past transform into relying on the masses to do a good job in production, and the attendance rate reached 100%. Those who were passive in their work in the past have also turned into active ones, and have been praised by the public sector and the employees.

**The Work of Cultivating Backbone Elements Cannot Adapt to Objective Requirements**

At present, the scope of cultivating backbone elements in industry and commerce is still not large. Although many new activists have emerged after the joint ownership of all trades, the ranks of backbone elements have been expanded, and the role of backbone elements has also been brought into play. However, from the current new situation, it is far from being able to adapt to objective requirements. There are too many leading personnel studying in political schools at all levels, and too few or no production personnel and salespersons. In terms of attending meetings and participating in social activities, it is even more limited to some upper-level figures. Therefore, some people say, "Anyway, it's those twenty-eight constellations." Therefore, the distance of political thought among industrialists and businessmen is very far. At the same time, the current leading figures and backbone elements in industry and commerce, some have developed arrogance and complacency, standing high above; they are not united with the masses they are connected with, learning and remolding together, encouraging each other, and progressing together, but rather talk about positions, viewpoints, and methods at every turn, and policy principles in words, making the masses dare not approach them; they are accustomed to using the method of labeling and suggesting that the government solve problems through administrative means of subduing people with law, unwilling to go deep into investigation and research, unwilling to patiently persuade, solving problems ideologically, solving contradictions from the desire for unity, fearing to lose their own position in representing the legitimate interests of members, and thus become detached from the masses.

**Family Work Must Keep Up**

Another problem is that family work cannot keep up. The work in the year after the joint venture proves that doing a good job in the ideological remolding of industrialists and businessmen and doing a good job in the family work of industrialists and businessmen is also a necessary factor. Now some family members see that they cannot spend money casually now, so they propose divorce; they express dissatisfaction with their spouse buying government bonds; their spouse goes out early and returns late, saying "Only you are active," and so on, which affects the ideological progress of industrialists and businessmen. At present, the Federation of Industry and Commerce has no special organization, and the Women's Federation has no full-time cadres to cooperate, forming a lack of leadership.

We believe that the ideological remolding of industrialists and businessmen must be an organic coordination of all aspects. From leadership to the grassroots, the ideological remolding of industrialists and businessmen should correctly use the formula of "unity-criticism-unity." We suggest and hope that the public sector of enterprises should further attach importance to the ideological remolding of private sector personnel, and the leading figures in the business community should reverse the work style of being detached from the masses. Women's federations at all levels should allocate full-time cadres to cooperate with the Federation of Industry and Commerce to do a good job in the family work of the business community. Under the leadership of the Party at all levels, we will jointly strive to complete the cause of socialist transformation.

    工商业者的思想要很好地改造
    王海亭、初允斗、陶锡庆
    （编者注：这篇文章是旅大市工商业联合会副主任委员、民主建国会旅大市委员会委员陶锡庆和旅大市工商业联合会常务委员、民主建国会旅大市委员会委员王海亭、初允斗在辽宁省政协会议上的联合发言，本报略有删节。）
    毛主席在最高国务会议和宣传工作会议上两个讲话，使我们对正确处理人民内部矛盾问题，有了进一步的认识。毛主席这个指示，鼓舞着我们工商业者更加紧密的团结在党的周围，积极的接受社会主义改造，把自己尽快的改造成为自食其力的劳动者。
    工商业者思想改造落后于社会地位的改变
    我们国家当前正处在社会大变动时期。当生产关系起了根本变化之后，人民内部的矛盾也是来自各方面。作为工商业者来说，由于阶级本质所带来的两面性，和思想教育工作不全面不彻底，因而日益暴露出思想意识的改造落后于社会地位的改变。这样的矛盾，也就给我们今后的思想教育工作提出了新课题。
    当前工商业者的思想情况怎样呢？据我们的不全面了解，以旅大情况讲一讲。
    自从全行业公私合营以来，大部分工商业者，在党的赎买政策的感召之下，在工作和学习方面都有了不同程度的进步，绝大部分工商业者参加了社会主义竞赛，发挥了技术和管理才能，不少人被评为先进生产者和先进工作者。在政治理论学习方面，大家也受到了“破资本主义、立社会主义”的启发教育，提高了政治觉悟，认清了自己的前途。这是积极的一面，也是主要的。但是，在工商业者中间的不健康现象，也就是消极的一面，还不断产生，具体表现在以下几个方面：
      工商界消极的思想和行为还有不少
    一、有的人有松劲情绪和作客思想。有些人认为“股息已定，人事安排已完，工资有了保留，企业有公方领导，好坏与我无关”。“不管企业赔赚，反正瞎不了我五厘定息”。因此就得过且过，敷衍了事，不像过去关心自己企业那样关心合营企业了。还有的说：“上面号召多、快、好、省，我们也多、快、好、省，这就是：赚钱多、下班快、待遇好、力气省”。还有的人认为按时上班下班，按制度办事就是做到了守职尽责。有一个负责作采买工作的私方人员说：“给企业买东西不用管贵贱，反正有发货票就能报销”。个别的人争取做先进工作者的目的是单纯为了得奖，能得奖就干，得不到奖的就不干，只表扬不给物资奖励就不满。有人说：“工作要干在刀刃上，别干在刀背上，能看见的才干，看不见的就不干。”
    二、对社会主义的优越性还有怀疑，有留恋资本主义的思想情绪。有一些人把合营企业生产经营中的某些缺点和当前物资紧张、副食品供应不足的情况，错误的看成是社会主义制度带来的。有的人不愿意遵守企业的生产、财务和物资供应计划，认为不如自己经营时那样任所欲为。有的在工作中一遇到困难就回头看，对过去自己说了算，自由随便，吃、喝、玩、乐等资本主义经营方式和腐朽生活，表现了留恋情绪。因之对现实生活表示不满，消极情绪随之而来，甚至违犯法制，贪污盗窃国家资财来满足个人私欲。自由市场开放以后，有一些人看到自由市场有厚利可图，就眼红心热，认为“既有今日，何必当初”，走社会主义的决心动摇了，甚至有的公然提出要退出合营企业，回头走资本主义的老路。
    三、骄傲自满，忽视自我改造。全业合营后，有的人只看到了自己进步和积极的一面，而没有看到消极的一面。有的人认为资产阶级的两面性已不存在。他们说：“名利思想，人皆有之，干部、工人也计较名利，工人农民也有在市场上进行商业投机的，若说这是两面性，那工人阶级、农民阶级、资产阶级都有两面性。”有的人以为自己有文化、有技术，便处处以财富自居，瞧不起公方和职工，他们认为“讲技术公方不如我，论文化我比工人高。”因此就不能很好的接受公方领导和向职工群众靠拢。有的在私私之间互不服气，彼此猜忌，勾心斗角，争名夺利。有的人不是帮助和欢迎别人进步，相反的看到别人进步，还讽刺打击；看到别人犯了错误不是真诚帮助，而是抱着幸灾乐祸的态度，认为别人落后和犯了错误，就显出了自己的进步和高明。
    仅就上述这些矛盾来看，虽然不是旅大市工商业者的思想主流，但它确是阻碍了工商业者在增产节约运动中贡献力量和自我改造的进行。因此，必须采取措施加强对工商业者的思想领导和思想教育工作。
    党对工商业者的关怀和照顾
    几年来党和政府对工商业者的思想改造工作，一向是极其重视和关怀的，并从多方面为工商业者的学习改造创造了有利条件。如定息七年不变，让我们有一个较长时期安心工作，安心学习，安心改造；举办了各级社会主义政治学校和讲习班，让我们脱产学习，等等。这都说明了党对工商业者无微不至的关怀和照顾，使我们感受到作为一个新中国的工商业者多么荣幸，多么温暖。但是对工商业者的思想改造工作中，不是毫无问题了。据我们了解，有的人对工商业者以企业为基地，通过业务的实践进行思想改造工作的重要意义还是重视不够。有的企业单位偏重于生产经营，不大注意私方人员的思想和进步，把民建会和工商联的活动看成麻烦，把私方人员的学习和会议看成负担，有的生产社社员参加工商联代表大会不给工资，互相配合与支持不够。
    党组织支持民建会和工商联工作的一例
    我们深深体会到，凡是企业的领导重视私方人员的思想教育工作，能够支持民建会和工商联的工作，就能够调动起私方人员的积极性，变消极为积极，使私方人员在工作中作出贡献，接受改造。如旅大棉织厂由于企业党委一向关心私方人员的思想改造工作，重视民建会企业支部的会务活动，每次有关业务会议都事先找民建支部的负责人商量研究，因而在工作中做到了思想一致，步调一致，鼓舞了民建会员的积极性。过去一个时期私方人员的思想情况比较混乱，有的私方人员在私营时，都亲自动手将缕子压紧，能多出布，而合营后明知缕子压的松，也装不知道，怕引起工人不满，于自己不利；当听到企业亏损棉纱，浪费零件，工人出勤率不高，就以为是合营制度没有优越性，因而情绪消极。发现这一情况后，企业党委及时的向民建支部作了布置，并责成民建支部召开会员扩大会议，针对私方人员的思想情况进行了分析研究，在公方代表的领导和支持下，组成检查小组，深入到各车间检查浪费现象和存在问题。检查的结果，清出账外棉花两千余捆，机器零件足够半年之用，以及劳动纪律等问题，引起了企业党委和私方代表的重视，以行业公会的名义召开全体私方人员大会，对所检查出的问题作了分析、批判，进行了以企业为家和勤俭办企业的报告，公方代表也在会上提出建议。会后，以民建会员为骨干分组讨论。通过这一事实的教育，占车间管理干部80％的私方人员，都检查和批判了自己的模糊认识和依赖思想。有不少的人制定出个人的增产节约保证条件，提出了不少的合理化建议，能算出价值的就达数万元。这一行动不仅给国家作出了贡献，也深深的教育和鼓励了私方人员守职尽责和接受改造的信心，使得过去管理很混乱的车间，转变为依靠群众搞好生产，出勤率达到百分之百。过去工作消极的也转变为积极了，受到公方的表扬和职工的好评。
    培养骨干分子的工作不能适应客观的要求
    现在，在工商业中培养骨干分子的面还不大，尽管是在全业合营后出现了不少新的积极分子，扩大了骨干分子的队伍，也发挥了骨干分子的作用。但是从现在新的情况来看，还远远的不能适应客观的要求。在各级政治学校里学习的领导人员太多，生产人员和营业员太少，或者是没有。在开会和参加社会活动方面更局限在一些上层人物。因此有人说：“反正是他们二十八宿。”因而现在工商业者中的政治思想的距离是很远的。同时当前工商业中的领导人物和骨干分子，有的产生了骄傲自满情绪，高高在上；不是和所联系的群众团结在一起，共同学习共同改造，互相鼓励，互相进步，而是动则立场、观点、方法，言则政策原则，使群众不敢接近；他们习惯于用扣帽子的方法和建议政府通过以法服人的行政手段，来解决问题，不愿深入调查研究，不愿耐心说服，从思想上解决问题，从团结的愿望出发解决矛盾，代表会员的合法利益怕失掉自己的立场，因而脱离群众。
    家属工作要跟上
    还有一个问题是家属工作跟不上。合营后一年来的工作证明，作好工商业者的思想改造工作，作好工商业者家属工作也是一个必要的因素。现在有的家属看到现在不能随便花钱，就提出离婚；对爱人买公债表示不满；爱人早起晚回，说“就你积极”，等等，这就影响工商业者的思想进步。当前工商联既没专门机构，妇联又没有专责干部配合，形成领导无力。
    我们认为，对工商业者的思想改造工作，必须是各个方面的有机配合，从领导到基层对工商业者的思想改造，都应正确的运用“团结——批评——团结”这一公式。我们建议并希望：企业公方要进一步重视私方人员的思想改造工作，工商界的领导人物，要扭转脱离群众的工作作风。各级妇联配备专职干部配合工商联作好工商界家属工作，在各级党的领导下，共同为完成社会主义改造事业而奋斗。更　正
