    "Western European Union"
    On March 4, 1948, the foreign ministers of the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg held a meeting in Brussels, and on the 17th, they signed a so-called "Treaty of Mutual Assistance and Collective Defense" for a term of fifty years, also known as the "Brussels Treaty." The organization formed by this treaty is generally referred to as the "Western European Union."
    The "Western European Union" advertises so-called "cooperation in economic, social, cultural, and collective self-defense aspects" in its organizational charter, but in reality, it is an alliance with imperialistic aims. The treaty stipulates that if any contracting party raises "any situation that constitutes a threat to peace, no matter where it occurs" or "any situation that constitutes a threat to economic stability," the Council of the Contracting Parties shall immediately convene a meeting to discuss countermeasures.
    When the "Western European Union" was first established, the American ruling group immediately declared its support for the organization. The then-US President Truman issued a statement on the day the treaty was signed, expressing full support for the contracting parties. The reason the United States was so active was that it was eager to use this alliance to easily control Western European countries and make them subordinate to American strategic objectives.
    After the formation of the "North Atlantic Treaty" group, under American pressure, the Council of the "Western European Union" decided at a meeting held on December 12, 1950, to incorporate the "Defense Organization" of the alliance into the North Atlantic Treaty Command. In this way, the "Western European Union" became a subordinate institution of the North Atlantic Treaty Group, and it already existed in name only.
    Originally, the "Western European Union" was an organization with the British-French alliance at its core. One of the actual purposes of Britain's initial organization of this alliance was to strengthen its ties with Western European countries, establish its position as a leader among Western European countries, and use the manpower and material resources of Western European countries to serve British interests. However, due to the weakening of Britain's economic power and the large-scale penetration of American power into Western Europe after the war, Britain's attempt was frustrated. Not only was its wish not realized, but it was used by the United States to establish the "North Atlantic Treaty" group dominated by the United States, becoming an organizational mechanism for the United States to control Western European countries.
    In 1954, after the "European Army Plan" vigorously planned by the United States was defeated by the French National Assembly, Britain picked up the "Western European Union" again as the foundation for establishing a new Western European military group. On October 3, the United States, Britain, France, West Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Italy, Canada, and other nine countries held a meeting in London, deciding to absorb West Germany and Italy into the "Western European Union," and decided to revise the "Western European Union" treaty. The revised "Western European Union" treaty stipulates: "The system of mutual assistance that occurs naturally in the event of an attack will extend to the Federal Republic of Germany and Italy." This revision essentially formally cancels the original purpose of preventing the resurgence of German militarism, which was originally advertised in this treaty, and makes this alliance more blatantly a military group hostile to the people's democratic countries led by the Soviet Union.
    Recently, due to the long-term large-scale expansion of armaments, especially because of the failure to invade Egypt, Britain has experienced great economic difficulties and has been forced to decide to cut military spending and reduce some overseas troops. This decision has caused a great reaction in the United States and the member states of the "Western European Union." For this reason, the "Western European Union" Parliament is holding a meeting in Strasbourg to discuss the problems caused by this British action. Under the influence of the United States, representatives of some member states of the alliance have already spoken at the meeting against "taking unilateral decisions" to cut armaments. This shows that a sharp struggle is taking place around the issue of Britain's reduction of conventional armaments among the countries of the "Western European Union" and the United States, which, although standing outside the alliance, is actually involved in the affairs of the alliance.

### “西欧联盟”

    “西欧联盟”
    1948年3月4日，英国、法国、比利时、荷兰和卢森堡五国的外长在布鲁塞尔举行会议，17日签订了一个为期五十年的所谓“互助与集体防御条约”，也称为“布鲁塞尔条约”，这条约的组织就是一般所说的“西欧联盟”。
    “西欧联盟”在它的组织条文里以所谓“经济、社会、文化方面及集体自卫方面的合作”为标榜，但是实际上却是一个带有帝国主义目的的联盟。联盟条约中规定任何缔约国在提出“关于不论何处发生构成对和平的威胁的任何情势”或“关于构成对经济稳定的威胁的任何情势”时，缔约国理事会就立即召开会议来讨论对策。
    当“西欧联盟”组织刚成立时，美国统治集团就立即宣称给予这个组织以支持。当时的美国总统杜鲁门在条约签订的当天，就发表声明，表示全力支持各缔约国。美国之所以表现积极，是因为它极想利用这种联盟，便于它统一掌握西欧国家，使之服从于美国的战略目的。
    “北大西洋公约”集团组成以后，在美国压力下，“西欧联盟”理事会在1950年12月12日举行的会议上，就决定将联盟组织的“防务组织”并入北大西洋公约司令部。这样，“西欧联盟”就成为北大西洋公约集团的一个附属机构，已经是名存实亡了。
    本来“西欧联盟”是以英、法联盟为核心的一个组织。英国当初发起组织这个联盟的一个实际目的，是想借以加强它和西欧各国的联系，建立它在西欧国家中的盟主地位，利用西欧各国的人力、物力来为英国的利益服务。但是，由于英国在战后经济势力的削弱和美国势力的大规模渗入西欧，英国的这一图谋受到了挫折，不但愿望没有实现，反而被美国利用来建立了以美国为主的“北大西洋公约”集团，成为美国控制西欧各国的一个组织机构。
    1954年，美国致力筹划的“欧洲军计划”因法国国民议会否决而完蛋以后，英国又重新拣起“西欧联盟”，作为建立一个新的西欧军事集团的基础。10月3日美、英、法、西德、荷、比、卢、意、加等九国在伦敦举行会议，决定吸收西德和意大利参加“西欧联盟”，并且决定对“西欧联盟”条约加以修改。“西欧联盟”条约修改后规定：“在一旦发生攻击时自然而然进行互助的制度将扩及德意志联邦共和国和意大利”。这种修改实质上就是正式取消了这个条约中原来所标榜的防止德国军国主义再起的目的，而使这个联盟更露骨地成为一个同苏联为首的人民民主国家敌对的军事集团。
    近来，英国由于长期大规模扩充军备，特别是因为侵埃失败，经济发生很大困难，被迫决定削减军费，减少海外部分驻军。这个决定在美国和“西欧联盟”成员国中引起很大反应。为此，“西欧联盟”议会正在斯特拉斯堡举行会议，讨论英国这一行动引起的问题。在美国的影响下，联盟的某些成员国的代表已在会上发言反对“采取单方面的决定”来削减军备。这说明，围绕着英国裁减常规军备的问题，“西欧联盟”各国以及虽然站在联盟之外，但实际上参预联盟事务的美国正在进行尖锐的斗争。　（铎）
