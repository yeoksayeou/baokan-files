    Letters to the Editor

    I read my speech at the symposium held by the Ministry of Commerce, which was published on page 3 of the People's Daily on the 22nd. After reading it, I felt that two sentences in it were very inappropriate and would cause one-sided arguments. It may be that I did not speak clearly during the speech, which made it difficult to organize the record. Therefore, I would like to ask you to supplement and correct it.
    The corrections are as follows:
      Please change "The Party interferes in ideological education" to "The Party interferes in political and ideological leadership education."
      Please change "Major policies and measures should be discussed by all cadres within the ministry" to "Non-confidential major policies and measures should be discussed by all cadres within the ministry."
    Xiong Huisan, Member of the China Democratic League Branch of the Ministry of Commerce

    来函照登
    人民日报22日第三版刊登我在商业部召开的座谈会上的发言，看后我感到其中有二句话很不妥当，会引起片面性的争论；可能是我在发言中讲得不清楚，使整理记录有困难所造成的。因此想请你们补充更正一下。
    更正的地方如下：
      “党过问思想教育问题”请改为“党过问政治思想上的领导教育问题”。
      “重大政策措施，应由部内所有的干部讨论”请改为“非机密性的重大政策措施，应由部内所有的干部讨论。”
