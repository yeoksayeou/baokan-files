Xinhua News Agency, Washington, May 28th: Chiang Kai-shek's "ambassador" to the United States, Dong Xian-guang, stated once again on the American Broadcasting Company's television program on the evening of the 27th that the Chiang Kai-shek clique is willing to compensate for the American "embassy" in Taiwan and the "losses" that were destroyed by the masses during the anti-American demonstrations. He said that if necessary, the Chiang Kai-shek clique is willing to pay for the construction of a new "embassy."

He said that one of the reasons for the disturbances was that Americans cheered the American military court's decision to acquit the American soldier who killed Liu Ziran. He tried his best to say that this incident was an "isolated incident" that later became "unmanageable" and "the price for us was very high."

Dong Xian-guang pleaded that the United States not withdraw its "aid" to the Chiang Kai-shek clique because of this incident.

	Kuomintang Clique Arrests Two Journalists

Xinhua News Agency, May 28th: According to International News Service, Taipei, the Kuomintang police authorities arrested Wang Dacheng and Hong Chengzong (both transliterations), reporters from Taiwan's "China Broadcasting Corporation," yesterday on the grounds of "helping to incite" the masses to attack the American "embassy." International News Service said: Their arrest was due to American officials in Taipei accusing "agitators of launching the riot" and accusing "the Kuomintang police and army of acting slowly."

The arrest of these two journalists was solely because they used tape recorders to record Liu Ziran's wife's speech on the day of the large-scale demonstration and broadcast it on the radio. In this speech, Liu Ziran's wife protested against the United States' verdict of "not guilty" for the murderer who killed her husband.

Agence France-Presse said that Kuomintang secret service agencies also demanded that local photographers who covered the anti-American demonstrations hand over their negatives for "verification" and are questioning several Chinese journalists who covered the demonstrations.

    蒋介石集团媚外压内
    董显光摇尾乞怜再次向美国赔罪
    新华社28日讯　华盛顿消息：蒋介石驻美国“大使”董显光27日晚在美国广播公司的电视节目中再一次表示，蒋介石集团愿意赔偿在反美大示威中被群众捣毁的美国驻台湾“大使馆”和“损失”。他说，如果必要的话，蒋介石集团愿意出钱建造一座新的“大使馆”。
    他说，引起骚动的原因之一是美国人欢呼了美国军事法庭判处杀死刘自然的美国军人无罪的决定。他竭力说这次事件是“孤立的事件”，后来才“弄得不可收拾”，并且“对我们的代价是很巨大的”。
    董显光以哀求的语气希望美国不要因为这次事件而撤回对蒋介石集团的“援助”。

      国民党集团逮捕两名记者
    新华社28日讯　据国际新闻社台北消息，国民党警察当局以“帮助煽动”群众袭击美国“大使馆”为名，昨天逮捕了台湾“中国广播公司”的记者王大成和洪成忠（都是译音）。国际新闻社说：他们的被捕是因为在台北的美国官员指责“煽动分子发动了这次暴动”，并且指责“国民党的警察和军队行动慢吞吞”。
    这两名记者的被捕，只是由于他们在大示威发生那天，用录音机录下了刘自然妻子的演说，在电台播送。在这篇演说中，刘自然妻子对美国宣判杀害她的丈夫的凶手“无罪”，提出抗议。
    法新社说，国民党特务机关还要求采访反美大示威消息的当地摄影记者交出他们的底片供作“考证”，并且正在询问几个曾在示威地点采访的中国籍新闻记者。
