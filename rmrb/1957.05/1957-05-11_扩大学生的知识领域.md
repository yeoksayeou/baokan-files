    Expanding Students' Knowledge Domain
    Since schools have begun to focus on strengthening students' ability to think and work independently, some new developments have emerged in students' learning and life. Their enthusiasm for learning has increased, they are able to engage in bold debates, and their lives have become more active.
    However, many students confine their lives and studies to a very small circle, and their personal lives seem to be disconnected from the life of society as a whole. Some students limit the scope of their studies and lives to their own major, rarely learning other knowledge, and knowing little about the surrounding environment. There are also students who don't even know what the major newspapers and magazines in the country are, and when asked what kind of magazine "World Knowledge" is, they can't answer. There are also students who, in a semester, only look at notes and lecture materials and never see a movie.
    Some students think these are trivial matters of life and not worth mentioning. In fact, this is a problem that should not be ignored. The more broad-minded and knowledgeable a person is, the richer and more colorful they will find life, and the more they will love it. Marx once said: "Nothing human is alien to me." This is the pride of being the master of life. If learning and life are confined to a small circle, the knowledge gained will be very limited. I believe that in addition to studying their major well, college students should broaden their horizons, pay attention to contact with the broader social life, regularly pay attention to the development of current affairs, watch more good movies and novels, and enrich and fulfill their lives.　　·Sha Zhou·

    扩大学生的知识领域
    自从学校注意加强培养学生独立思考和独立工作能力以后，学生的学习和生活方面出现了一些新气象，学习积极性提高了，能够大胆展开争论了，生活也活跃起来了。
    但是，也有不少学生把生活和学习只限在一个很小的圈子内，个人的生活好像和整个社会的生活割断了连系。有的学生把自己的学习和生活范围只限于自己的专业之内，很少学习其他知识，对周围的环境也很少了解。还有的学生对全国有哪些主要的报刊杂志也不知道，“世界知识”是什么样的杂志？他就没办法回答。也有的学生一学期来，除了笔记就是讲义，不看一次电影。
    有些学生认为这些都是生活小事，不屑一提。其实这是不应该忽视的问题。一个人越是兴趣广泛，知识渊博，就越觉得生活是丰富多采的，更能热爱生活。马克思曾说过：人类的一切在我都不生疏。这是作为生活主人的自豪。如果把学习、生活划在一个小圈子里，获得的知识是很贫乏的。我认为，大学生除了学好专业之外，应当扩大自己的视野，注意同广大社会生活接触，经常关心时事的发展，多看些好的电影和小说，丰富和充实自己的生活。        　·沙舟·
