    Guangdong: Many County-Level and Above Cadres Go Down to the Countryside, Down to the Communes, and Down to the Fields, Integrating with Grassroots Cadres and Commune Members

    (By our newspaper) Since the beginning of spring, Guangdong Province has successively dispatched nearly 100,000 cadres to the countryside to lead spring plowing production. These include responsible cadres such as the Provincial Party Committee Secretary, Vice-Governor, Prefectural Party Committee Secretary, Commissioner, County Party Committee Secretary, and County Head. After going down to the countryside, the vast majority of them personally participated in production, led production, set an example, and integrated with local district and township cadres and the masses. For example, in the Huiyang Special District, where soil improvement was the main measure for increasing production this year, some cadres and farmers initially mistakenly believed that soil improvement was labor-intensive and yielded little, and were unwilling to do more. Later, Ma Lun, First Secretary of the CCP Huiyang Prefectural Committee, personally went to the Zhongkeng Agricultural Cooperative in Dongguan County and took the lead in carrying mud to the fields. He also promptly helped cadres and the masses eliminate unnecessary ideological concerns, which not only promoted soil improvement but also increased labor efficiency by two times. Currently, more than one million mu of low-yield land in the district has completed soil improvement work. During the busy season of rice transplanting in Wanning, Chengmai, Xingning, and other counties, the County Party Committee Secretaries rolled up their trouser legs before dawn and went to the fields to plow, harrow, and transplant rice with the masses, completing the transplanting work five or six days earlier than in previous years. Soon after arriving at the Shagang Cooperative in Jiaoling County, County Head Zhang Zhiyao discovered that the commune members' enthusiasm for production was not high and that the fertilizer for many rice fields had not yet been resolved. He immediately took off his shoes and went to the mountains more than ten miles away from the cooperative to cut grass and accumulate fertilizer, which led more than eighty commune members to join the fertilizer accumulation campaign. Eighty-eight-year-old Grandma Xiao Bomu said, "I have never seen a County Head taking off his shoes to accumulate fertilizer since ancient times. The Communist Party's cadres are really good!" In Sijiu Township, Fogang County, some cooperative cadres and commune members were initially passive and lazy. However, after seeing the cadres sent down by the Prefectural Committee buy hoes at their own expense and work with everyone, they were very moved. They said, "This is a major change since the land reform!" Thirteen female commune members originally planned to ask for leave to visit their families, but seeing the Prefectural Committee cadres working in the fields, they also voluntarily gave up their plans to visit their families and went to the fields to produce. Some township cadres who originally thought that the leaders only knew how to talk but not how to work now saw the leading comrades working in the fields themselves, and some of their dissatisfaction disappeared.

    In the process of working and producing in the countryside, communes, and fields, responsible cadres in various localities also paid attention to personally participating in the production of key projects for increasing production, so as to discover and solve problems in a timely manner during the production process. At the same time, they also paid attention to adhering to focusing on one key point, drawing experience from it, and then promoting comprehensive production work through conference exchanges.

### 广东许多县级以上干部下乡下社下田  同基层干部和社员群众打成一片

    广东许多县级以上干部下乡下社下田
    同基层干部和社员群众打成一片
    本报讯　广东省各专、县级以上的干部下乡、下社、下田以后，对改进领导作风、鼓舞基层干部情绪和密切群众关系，起了很大的作用。
    入春以来，这个省曾经先后抽调了将近十万名干部下乡领导春耕生产。其中包括省委书记、副省长、地委书记、专员、县委书记、县长等负责干部。他们下乡以后，绝大多数都是亲自参加生产，领导生产，以身作则，与当地的区、乡干部和群众打成一片。如今年以改良土壤为主要增产措施的惠阳专区，初期有些干部和农民错误地认为改良土壤费工多、收效少，不愿多改。后经中共惠阳地委第一书记马伦亲自深入东莞县中坑农业社带头挑坭下田，并及时帮助干部、群众解除了不必要的思想顾虑，不仅推动了改良土壤工作，还使劳动效率提高了两倍。现在，全区已有一百多万亩低产田完成了土壤改良工作。万宁、澄迈、兴宁等县在插秧大忙的时候，这些县的县委书记，天还没有亮，就卷起裤筒走到田间，和群众一起犁田、耙田、插秧，使插秧工作比往年提早五、六天完成。蕉岭县县长张志姚来到神岗社不久，便发现社员生产情绪不高，许多稻田肥料尚未解决，他立即脱鞋亲自到离社十多里路外的山上割草积肥，结果带动了八十多个社员投入了积肥运动。八十八岁的肖伯姆老太太说：“自古以来，也没有看见过县长除鞋积肥，共产党的干部真好啊！”再如佛冈县四九乡，最初有些社干部和社员消极怠工，后来看到地委派下来的干部自己出钱买锄头，与大伙一起干活，都非常感动，他们说：“这是土改后的大转变呀！”有十三个女社员原打算请假回娘家探亲，但看到地委的干部下田劳动，也自动放弃了探亲的打算，而下田生产去了。一些原来认为领导上只会讲、不会做的乡干部，现在看到领导同志亲自下田劳动，某些不满情绪也就烟消云散了。
    各地负责干部在下乡、下社、下田工作、生产中，还注意亲自参加带有关键性的增产项目的生产，以便在生产过程中及时发现问题、解决问题。同时，他们还注意坚持搞好一个重点，从中吸取经验，而后通过会议交流经验，从而推动了全面的生产工作。（李少球）（附图片）
