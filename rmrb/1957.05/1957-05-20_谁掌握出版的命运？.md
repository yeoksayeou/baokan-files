    Who Controls the Fate of Publication?
     The "Changjiang Literature and Art Publishing House" recently wrote a letter to an author:
     "Comrade ××: Your manuscript ××× has been reviewed and we have decided to adopt it. It is now included in the publication plan for May. However, there is a situation that must be explained to you in advance: Recently, bookstores have been extremely strict in controlling the number of orders for new book publication plans submitted by publishing houses. Sometimes the number of orders does not reach the base number agreed upon with the publishing house (the base number agreed upon by our publishing house and the bookstore is three thousand copies). Under these circumstances, the publishing house has no choice but to stop the publication of this manuscript. ... Although your manuscript ××× has been included in the publication plan and bookstores have been arranged to order it, the number of orders from bookstores in the future is uncertain. Therefore, if the bookstore orders more than three thousand copies, we will not say anything and will publish it as usual; but if the bookstore orders less than three thousand copies, we will abandon the publication of this manuscript and return the original manuscript to you. This is not something that the subjective strength of the publishing house can change, so we have to make a statement in advance to avoid misunderstandings by the author in case this happens."
    The fate of a book's publication, who exactly controls it? The publishing house has decided to accept the publication, but it still cannot be born safely, its life and death are still in the hands of the bookstore, it's truly a ridiculous joke!

    谁掌握出版的命运？
     “长江文艺出版社”在最近给一位作者写了一封信：
     “××同志：尊稿×××经研读后，决定采用。现已订入五月份发稿计划。但有个情况须得先向你说明：近来书店对出版社提出的新书出版计划，在订货时控制数字极为严格。有时订货数字不能达到与出版社协议的基数（本社与书店协议的基数是三千册）。在这种情况之下，出版社只好停止这一书稿的出版。……尊稿×××虽已列入发稿计划，并已布置书店订货，但日后书店订货多少，却无把握。因此，如书店订货在三千册以上便不说了，我们照常出版；但如书店订货在三千册以内，我们即放弃此稿的出版，而将原稿退给你。这不是出版社主观力量可以改变的事，所以不得不预作声明，以免万一发生这类情况时引起作者误会。”
    一本书的出版命运，究竟掌握在谁的手里？出版社决定接受出版了，还不能平安地诞生，它的生死还操在书店手里，真是荒唐的笑话！
