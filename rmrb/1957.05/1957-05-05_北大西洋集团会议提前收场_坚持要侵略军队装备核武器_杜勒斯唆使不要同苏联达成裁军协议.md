Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, 4th. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council's meeting in Bonn, originally scheduled for three days, ended prematurely after two days of discussion on May 3rd due to a lack of new progress. The meeting agreed to maintain the principle decision made by the Council last December that North Atlantic Group troops should be equipped with nuclear weapons. However, amidst the current tense election atmosphere in West Germany, concrete discussions on this issue have been postponed to future meetings.

Despite facing criticism at the meeting for Britain's plans to reduce its troops, British Foreign Secretary Lloyd insisted on the British government's plan.

At the end of the foreign ministers' meeting of the Council, a communique was issued, emphasizing that the North Atlantic Group countries "must continue to maintain unity." The communique stated that the recent warnings from the Soviet Union regarding the dangers of equipping nuclear weapons should be disregarded, and expressed that it is necessary to "possess new weapons required for the defense of the alliance."

It is reported that Dulles particularly emphasized at the May 3rd meeting that the North Atlantic Alliance should not be "optimistic" about the prospect of reaching a disarmament agreement with the Soviet Union.

The choice of Bonn as the location for this meeting was originally intended to add "capital" to the Adenauer government's election campaign. The communique of the meeting reiterated the Western countries' policy on the German question. It said that Germany should become a "free and unified" country within the system of the North Atlantic Group.

In addition to the issue of German unification, the issue of atomic armament is also a hot potato for the Adenauer government in the election campaign. The equipment of West German troops with nuclear weapons has aroused widespread public opposition, and opposition parties have attacked the Adenauer party on this issue. West German Foreign Minister Brentano hurriedly held a press conference after the meeting, saying that "the issue of West Germany's atomic armament was not discussed at the meeting." However, a spokesman for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization explicitly told reporters when explaining the meeting's communique that "the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is basing its military plans on the use of tactical nuclear weapons."

    北大西洋集团会议提前收场
    坚持要侵略军队装备核武器
    杜勒斯唆使不要同苏联达成裁军协议
    据新华社4日讯　波恩消息：原定举行三天的北大西洋公约组织理事会波恩会议，由于不能获得新进展而在讨论两天后提前在5月3日结束。这次会议同意保持去年12月理事会作出的北大西洋集团军队要装备核武器的原则决定。但是，在西德目前紧张的竞选气氛下，关于这个问题的具体讨论已推迟到以后的会议。
    尽管英国要削减军队的计划在会上受到许多责难，英国外交大臣劳埃德依然坚持了英国政府的计划。
    理事会外长级会议在结束时发表公报，强调北大西洋集团各国“必须继续保持团结”。公报认为应该不理会苏联最近发出的关于装备核武器的危险的警告，而表示必须“拥有联盟的防务所需的新式武器”。
    据报道，杜勒斯在3日会议上特别强调，北大西洋联盟对同苏联达成裁军协议的前景不要“乐观”。
    这次会议选择在波恩举行，原是要给阿登纳政府在竞选运动中增加“资本”。会议公报里重申了西方国家在德国问题上的政策。它说，德国应在北大西洋集团的体系内成为“自由统一”的国家。
    除了德国统一的问题，原子军备问题也是阿登纳政府在竞选运动中拿着的烫手的山药旦。西德军队要装备核武器，已引起公众广泛的反对，反对党纷纷在这个问题上攻击阿登纳党。西德外交部长勃伦塔诺赶忙在会议结束后举行记者招待会说“会议没有讨论西德的原子军备的问题。”然而，北大西洋公约组织发言人在解释会议公报时明确地对记者们说，“北大西洋公约组织是以使用战术核武器作为它的军事计划的基础的”。
