    Don't Wait for the Cold Weather to Rush Coal Transportation
    We are a sub-bureau of the Heilongjiang Railway Bureau. Recently, we examined the situation of cooperating with mines and coal construction companies to complete coal transportation tasks in the past year. We found that due to the lack of coordination among production, transportation, and sales departments, the difficulty of coal supply falling short of demand was artificially aggravated. During the second and third quarters, the production of various mines increased, but coal-consuming units rarely consigned shipments during this period. Most of the coal was rushed for consignment in the fourth quarter. The railway transportation situation was just the opposite. During the second and third quarters, due to the lack of harvesting of grain, sugar beets, etc., there was surplus transportation capacity, but there was a shortage of consigned goods, resulting in having vehicles but not enough goods to transport.
    Why does this contradiction arise?
    First, coal-consuming enterprises have departmentalism. They do not consider mine production and railway transportation conditions, emphasizing that they do not store coal in summer and transport it as needed in winter, believing that this can avoid the accumulation of funds in their units. Last year, we jointly suggested to the Heilongjiang Coal Construction Company with the Jixi Mining Bureau, taking advantage of the increase in coal production in the second and third quarters and the surplus vehicles on the railway, to transport and store more coal. We also proposed that the mining bureau could temporarily sell on credit if restricted by funds. However, the Heilongjiang Coal Construction Company did not accept this suggestion at all.
    Second, mine production is unbalanced, being relaxed at the beginning and tight at the end. For example, Dahengshan Mine produced more than 264,000 tons in the first quarter and 340,100 tons in the fourth quarter. In particular, the Xiaohengshan vertical shaft produced more than 38,000 tons in the first quarter and more than 110,000 tons in the fourth quarter, an increase of about two times. The disconnection between production and transportation also affects the needs of sales.
    Now let's look at the losses it has caused from several main aspects!
    On the mining side, because of the large coal output in the second and third quarters, it cannot be transported out, and the coal must be taken out of the warehouse and stored on the ground, causing a natural loss of about 2%. Jixi Mine lost 9,000 yuan due to more than 350,000 tons of coal being stored on the ground in two quarters, and then spent 178,800 yuan on re-loading in the fourth quarter.
    On the railway side, the transportation volume is insufficient in the second and third quarters, so the surplus vehicles have to be stored. Some stations are blocked due to the reserve vehicles, causing serious difficulties and waste in vehicle use and train operation adjustment. In the fourth quarter, the coal transportation task suddenly increased, and the railway had to minimize the transportation of other materials.
    Therefore, I suggest that coal-consuming units should transport more coal in the second and third quarters as much as possible, and coal mines should try to achieve balanced production. Everyone should work together to alleviate the difficulty of coal supply falling short of demand.

### 莫等天寒抢运煤

    莫等天寒抢运煤
    我们是黑龙江铁路管理局的一个分局。最近我们检查了去年一年配合矿山和煤建公司完成煤炭运输任务的情况，发现由于产、运、销各部门工作不协调，人为地加重了煤炭供不应求的困难。第二、三季度各矿山的生产上涨，但用煤单位这个期间很少托运。大部分的煤都等到第四季度抢着托运。铁路的运输情况则恰恰相反，第二、三季度因粮谷甜菜等都没有收割上市，运输力有余，而托运的物资缺少，形成有车辆没有足够的货物可运。
    为什么会产生这种矛盾呢？
    第一、用煤的企业存在本位主义思想，不考虑矿山生产和铁路运输条件，强调夏季不贮煤，冬季现用现运，认为这样可以避免本单位积压资金。去年我们曾同鸡西矿务局联合向黑龙江省煤建公司建议、趁第二、三季度煤矿的产量上涨，铁路又有多余的车辆，多运煤贮备起来。并提出：如受资金限制时，矿务局可暂时赊销。但是，黑龙江省煤建公司根本不接受这个意见。
    第二、矿山的生产不平衡，前松后紧。如大恒山矿第一季度生产二十六万四千多吨，第四季度生产三十四万零一百吨。特别是小恒山立井，第一季度生产三万八千多吨，第四季度则是十一万多吨，增加约二倍。生产和运输脱节，也影响了销售方面的需要。
    现在就从几个主要方面看一下它所造成的损失吧！
    在矿山方面，由于第二、三季度煤的产量大，运不出，必须将煤从仓里捣出，落地贮存，使煤遭到约2％的自然耗损量，鸡西矿在两个季度内共落地三十五万多吨煤，损失九千元，到第四季度再装车，又拿出十七万八千八百元的翻装费。
    在铁路方面，第二、三季度运量不足，就得将多余车辆贮备起来，有的站因备用车堵塞，造成车辆使用上和调整列车运行上的严重困难和浪费。到了第四季度，运煤任务突然增加，铁路又不得不尽量少运其他物资。
    因此，我建议，今后用煤单位要尽量在二、三季度多运煤，煤矿要尽量做到均衡生产，大家共同努力来缓和煤炭供不应求的困难。
