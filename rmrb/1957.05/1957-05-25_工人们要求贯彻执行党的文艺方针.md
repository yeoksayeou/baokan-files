Workers Demand Implementation of the Party's Literary and Artistic Policy
    Liu Jia

    This reporter interviewed many workers and trade unionists to solicit their opinions on the implementation of the Party's policy of literature and art serving workers, peasants, and soldiers. Based on their personal experiences, they offered many opinions on film and drama, mainly focusing on drama. They called on the cultural authorities to conduct inspections during the rectification campaign and gradually improve this work.

    "Leaders Should Come and See..."

    A comrade from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, who recently conducted an investigation in the Baotou Industrial Zone, said, "If you don't see it for yourself, it's hard to imagine the poverty of workers' cultural life." He said that in some worker-concentrated areas in Baotou, there are no theaters or cinemas, and the mobile film projection teams only bring old films. "I asked the workers what films they had seen this year, and they said, listen to what the workers themselves say: 'In that "Unforgettable 1919," I stood on "Golden Beach," gazing at "Gate No. 6."'" These are the few films they have seen this year. They have seen even fewer plays. He surveyed fifteen workers' families and found that only six people had seen a movie in the past year.

    This situation also exists in other emerging industrial cities in the Northwest, such as Luoyang, Xi'an, Lanzhou, and Xining. The workers in these places came from East China, North China, and Northeast China, and most of them are young workers with a higher level of education, so they are even more dissatisfied with this situation. They have such cries: "Boring Saturdays, depressing Sundays."

    In large cities such as Shanghai and Beijing, the cultural life of workers is much better, but there are still problems. For example, the eastern suburbs industrial area of Beijing has no cinemas or theaters. Shanghai has four workers' new villages, with a total population of 200,000 including family members, but there are no cinemas or theaters. Although the residences here are very beautiful, young workers are often unwilling to move in because of this.

    The workers demand that those who lead cultural work should go to their places to take a look.
    "Empty," "Idle," "Stuck"...

    Workers say: Cadres always explain to us that the country is currently facing economic difficulties and cultural conditions are backward, so we cannot build too many cinemas and theaters. We understand this principle. But the actual situation is not entirely like this. In big cities, theaters are empty (the average attendance rate of theaters in Beijing is 40% to 60%), theatrical troupes are idle (many theatrical troupes cannot perform because they have no venues), actors are stuck (some theatrical troupes have too many members, and actors have no opportunity to perform), and the audience is anxious (many people are blocked outside the theaters and cannot see the plays). People often say: "People move to live, trees move to die." Why do these theatrical troupes always squeeze into big cities? Why not move around and perform in factories and construction sites? The workers in the Baotou Industrial Zone request that theatrical troupes in Beijing make more touring performances, and the workers in the Northwest also request that theatrical troupes in Shanghai go to the construction sites in the Northwest to perform more often.

    "The more they improve, the farther they get from us workers," "The bigger the troupe, the harder it is to come down." Workers at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant in Beijing requested the China Pingju Opera Theater to perform Qin Xianglian, and they were rejected seven times in a row. The main reason was: "The scenery alone takes up eight trucks, can your venue accommodate it?" Then who are they preparing to serve?

    Workers have opinions about the high ticket prices. Workers in the Northwest wrote a doggerel: "Commodity prices are stable and falling, but only theater tickets rise by leaps and bounds." The workers know that professional theatrical troupes are engaged in enterprise management. They say, "One 'ization' is bearable, but two 'izations' are unbearable." That is to say: "Bureaucratization" (the expansion and waste of theatrical troupes) plus enterprise management (in terms of operation), the workers cannot bear it.

    Workers have opinions about the concentration of cinemas and theaters in the city center. According to statistics: Since the liberation of Lanzhou, the population has increased threefold, and the largest increase is in workers, most of whom are concentrated in the suburbs; the number of cinemas and theaters has only increased by a quarter, and four of the five cinemas and all nine theaters are in the urban area. Workers far away in the suburbs cannot go to the city to see plays. The original cinemas and theaters in Xi'an are all in the city center, and the newly built ones are also in the city center, while the eastern and western industrial areas do not have a single cinema or theater.

    Workers in the suburbs of Beijing say that the venues in the city are empty, but we cannot get in. Going to the city to see a play is difficult because of transportation, the buses are too crowded to get on; and it is also difficult economically, taking a family to the city to see a play, including transportation costs, ticket prices, and meal expenses, costs several yuan, which is unbearable; furthermore, time is also a problem, it takes a whole day to go back and forth, and you are so tired that you are not good at work the next day. Therefore, "After thinking it over, it is better not to go."

    Big Attitudes, Many "Conditions"

    Some people say: Agricultural production cooperatives implement "five guarantees" for their members, and now some theatrical troupes that perform in factories require "four guarantees." First, guarantee the stage: how high the stage should be, how wide the proscenium should be, how deep the stage should be, how many strips of this should be hung, and how many strips of that should be hung, and the lighting should be more than 10,000 watts. If these conditions are not met, they say "it is not suitable for our troupe to perform" and they will not come. Workers say: Our venues are "dining hall, auditorium, club, temporary workshop and warehouse." How can they be as complete as the big theatrical troupes require! Why can't the conditions be lowered?

    Second, guarantee more profit. The occupancy rate of theatrical troupes in the city is 40% to 60%, but if they perform at a factory, they have to be paid according to the full occupancy rate. State-owned theatrical troupes are assigned to maintain the income of a state-owned theater, so some state-owned theatrical troupes that perform in factories, in addition to their own income, also require the workers to compensate for the income of the original theater. A Beijing Peking Opera troupe went to the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant in Beijing to perform once, and the package price was as high as 1,100 yuan, with other expenses in addition. This is much higher than the actual income from selling tickets in the city. The high package price increases ticket prices. It is better for large factories with many audiences, but smaller factories cannot afford it.

    Third, guarantee pick-up and drop-off. Costumes, props, and scenery require large trucks, and actors require passenger cars, and each person must have a seat. The head and deputy head of the Beijing Peking Opera troupe and the main actors had to use small sedans to go to the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant in Beijing to perform, and the factory only provided one car, so they rented another one. Workers say that for all package performances, they require a particularly large number of cars, anyway, the theatrical troupe does not pay for the cars; for all performances where the theatrical troupe sells tickets themselves, they require fewer cars.

    Fourth, guarantee meals, the factory must provide one dinner. Some theatrical troupe leaders and main actors are unwilling to eat at the same table as ordinary actors and must be treated separately. A theatrical troupe touring a construction site in the Northwest even requested to eat Western food.

    These conditions make it impossible for many factories and construction sites to invite state-owned theatrical troupes to perform, and even if some meet the conditions, it is very difficult to invite a state-owned theatrical troupe once. Workers at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant in Beijing said: Famous theatrical troupes cannot be invited; sometimes even if we beg and plead, some famous actors do not come; sometimes we specifically request them, and the famous actors come, but only sing a small excerpt to show up, and the rest of the play is sung by ordinary actors. Workers said: "This is like a one-sided love affair, you want to see him, but he doesn't want to see you."

    Workers generally demand that theatrical troupes "put in more effort, put on less airs; bring more plays, bring less scenery."

    Workers believe that the reason why state-owned theatrical troupes are divorced from the working masses is primarily because the theatrical troupes themselves are too large, and the performances and scenery are too complicated. This has led to an excessive emphasis on profit. Workers believe that we should investigate the guiding ideology and business policy. If the cultural authorities do not solve this problem by streamlining theatrical troupes and overcoming waste, they can only increase ticket prices. Some theatrical troupes are willing to lower the ticket prices for performances for workers and increase their income by selling more tickets, but the cultural authorities do not agree, fearing that it will affect the occupancy rate of other theaters. A theatrical troupe in the Hongkou District of Shanghai went to a factory to perform, and the factory requested the theatrical troupe to lower ticket prices while guaranteeing to sell more tickets to increase the theatrical troupe's total income. The theatrical troupe agreed, but the Cultural Bureau insisted that the "state-owned price" could not be lowered casually, so it had to be abandoned. Workers in Baotou and the Northwest said: The theatrical troupes in Beijing and Shanghai have long distances to travel and high travel expenses, so the ticket prices will naturally be higher. Can the state give the theatrical troupes appropriate subsidies to encourage them to go to factories for touring performances? This is better than being stuck in the city for nothing.

    Lack of a Mass Line Perspective

    Workers at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant believe that relying solely on professional theatrical troupes to perform can never meet the needs of workers everywhere, and this problem can only be solved by relying on the activities of workers' amateur theatrical troupes. The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant has weekend evening parties every week, with many performances, all of which are performed by the workers' amateur theatrical troupes. The workers at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant have Peking Opera teams, drama teams, Pingju Opera teams, bands, and storytelling, all of which are amateur. Among them, the Peking Opera team is the most active and has achieved good results. The reason is that the China Peking Opera Theater has provided assistance in many aspects, especially in the guidance of actors. When mentioning the China Peking Opera Theater, the workers are still grateful. The China Youth Art Theater has given a lot of help to the drama team of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, and the workers have not forgotten it.

    However, most workers' amateur theatrical troupes are in a state of self-preservation because they cannot get guidance. Workers have a lot of opinions about this. They said that before 1954, people from professional theatrical troupes were very active in guiding amateur theatrical troupes, but now they don't care and say that they don't have this task. This problem cannot be completely solved through organizational procedures, but it can be partially solved through personal relationships. For example, an amateur Pingju Opera troupe in the Xidan District of Beijing could not find anyone to guide them, but later learned that the director of a Pingju Opera troupe, Zhang Jurong, lived nearby, and the problem was solved by asking him to come over. An amateur theatrical troupe in the Xidan District requested the Beijing People's Art Theater to help with guidance, but was rejected. Later, through a staff member of the Xidan District Cultural Center, they found his lover who worked at the Beijing People's Art Theater to help with guidance.

    Now, there are two major difficulties in amateur theatrical troupe activities: one is that no one provides guidance, and the other is the lack of scripts. The problem of guidance cannot be completely solved by relying on professional theatrical troupes alone, and the cultural authorities must seriously consider solving this problem. Regarding the supply of scripts, some professional theatrical troupes have scripts suitable for amateur theatrical troupes to perform, but they are unwilling to supply them. An amateur theatrical troupe in a factory in Tianjin borrowed a script from a theatrical troupe, but the theatrical troupe did not give it. The factory sent four people to see the play, and they took notes on the scenes and lines while watching, and went back to put together a script to perform. Workers also demand that the cultural authorities pay attention to organizing creation to solve the problem of script supply for amateur theatrical troupes.

    The cultural departments have not made full use of the cultural facilities of the trade unions. There are thirteen workers' clubs in Beijing, all of which can perform dramas. However, when assigning theatrical troupes, the Beijing Cultural Bureau adopted a restrictive policy towards these clubs in order to take care of the income of state-owned theaters. Not only are state-owned theatrical troupes rarely sent, but even privately-run professional theatrical troupes are rarely sent. The reason is that the clubs offer preferential ticket prices to workers, saying that this will reduce the seating of state-owned theaters. According to the person in charge of the Xidan District Workers' Club: The Cultural Bureau did not assign a single play to the Xidan District Workers' Club in May. There was also no assignment in April, saying that all the theatrical troupes had been assigned and would be discussed later. Later, this comrade learned that some folk professional theatrical troupes were stuck at home without venues to perform, so he first discussed with these theatrical troupes and then went to the Cultural Bureau, and only then was he able to assign two plays.

    Workers demand that the cultural authorities conduct inspections during the rectification campaign around the policy of literature and art serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, focusing on inspecting two aspects: one is how is the concept of serving the masses? The other is how is the concept of relying on the masses? Through these inspections, we will further expose the bureaucracy, dogmatism, and sectarianism in leadership, and take effective measures to overcome them.

    工人们要求贯彻执行党的文艺方针
    刘甲
    记者访问了好多工人和工会工作者，征求他们对文艺为工农兵服务的方针执行情况的意见。他们根据自己的切身感受，就电影和戏剧方面发表了许多意见，主要是对戏剧工作的意见。他们要求文化主管部门在整风中进行检查，逐步改进这方面的工作。“领导人应该下来看看……”
    最近到包头工业区作了一番考察的全国总工会的一个同志说：“如果不亲自去看看，对于工人文化生活的贫乏程度，就很难想像得出。”他说在包头的一些工人集中的区域，没有剧院、电影院，一些流动的电影放映队，带的都是些旧片子。”我问工人们今年看了些什么电影，他说，听听工人自己的说法吧：“在那‘难忘的一九一九年’，我站在‘金银滩’上，眼望着‘六号门’。”这就是他们今年看过的几部片子。戏就看的更少。他调查了十五家工人家属，在一年当中，看过电影的只有六人。
    这种情况，在西北各新兴工业城市如洛阳、西安、兰州、西宁等地也存在着。这些地方的工人是从华东、华北、东北等地去的，青年工人多，文化程度较高，对这种情况就更加不满。他们有这样的呼声：“无聊的礼拜六，苦闷的星期天”。
    在上海、北京等大城市，工人的文化生活状况要好的多，但也不是没有问题。像北京的东郊工业区，也没有影剧院。上海有四个工人新村，连家属共二十万人口，也没有影剧院，虽然这里的住宅很漂亮，青年工人们往往因此不愿搬进去。
    工人们要求领导文化工作的人应该多到他们那里去看一看。“空着”、“闲着”、“窝着”……
    工人说：干部们老向我们解释，说国家目前经济困难，文化状况落后，不能修过多的电影院和戏院。这道理我们懂得。可是实际情况不是完全如此。在大城市里剧院空着（北京各戏院上座率平均是40％到60％），剧团闲着（许多剧团因没有场子不能演出），演员窝着（有些剧团人员过多，演员没有机会演出），观众急着（许多人被挡在戏院外边，看不上戏）。人常说：“人挪活，树挪死”，这些剧团为什么老挤在大城市里，不挪动挪动，到工厂、工地来演戏呢？包头工业区的工人要求北京的剧团多作巡回演出，西北的工人也要求上海的剧团多到西北各工地去演出。
      “越提高离我们工人越远”，“剧团越大越下不来”，北京石景山钢铁厂的工人们要求中国评剧院去演秦香莲，一连请了七次都被拒绝了。主要的理由就是：“光布景就有八卡车，你们那场子装得下？”那么他们究竟准备给什么人服务呢？
    工人们对票价太高有意见。西北工人作了打油诗：“物价稳定全下降，唯独戏票升万丈。”工人们知道专业剧团在搞企业化，他们说，“一化还好受，两化受不了。”就是说：“机关化”（剧团的扩大和浪费）加企业化（经营方面），工人就受不了。
    工人对影剧院都集中在市中心有意见。据统计：兰州市解放至今，人口增加了三倍，增加最多的是工人，大部集中在郊区；影剧院只增加四分之一，而五个影院四个在城区，九个剧场都在城区。远在郊区的工人就无法进城看戏。西安市的原有影剧院都在市中心，新建的又都在市中心，而东西部工业区却没有一个影剧院。
    北京郊区的工人说，城里场子空着，我们却进不去。进城看戏，一是交通困难，车子挤得坐不下；二是经济困难，带个家属进城看趟戏，连车费、票价带饭钱，就得好几块钱，那受得了；再说时间也有困难，来回一整天，累得够受，第二天上班就差劲了。因此“千思万想，只好不去”。
      架子大、“条件”多
    有人说：农业生产社对社员实行五保，现在有些下厂演出的剧团要求“四保”。一要保台场：台要多高，台口要多宽，台身要多深，还挂多少条这，吊多少条那，灯光要一万多瓦。不答应这些条件，就说“不适合本团演出”，不来。工人说：我们的场子是“食堂、礼堂、俱乐部，临时车间兼仓库”。那里能像大剧团要求的那么齐全！那为什么不能把条件放低些？
    二要保多赚钱。剧团在城内卖座是40％到60％，到工厂包场就要按满座算。国营剧团都分工负责维持一个国营剧场的收入，因此有的下厂演出的国营剧团，除了本团的收入外，还要求工人们把原剧场的收入也赔出来。北京市一个京剧团到石景山钢铁厂演出一次，包价高到一千一百元，其他费用还在外。这比在城内卖座演出实际收入高的多。包场价高使票价增高，大工厂观众多，还好些，小工厂就更加请不起了。
    三保接、送。服装、道具、布景用大卡车，演员要用客车，还得每人有个座位，正副团长和主要演员要用小卧车。北京市的那个京剧团去石景山钢铁厂演出，还要了两辆小车，厂子里只来了一辆，结果又租用了一辆。工人们说，凡是包场的，汽车就要的特别多，反正剧团又不出车钱；凡是由剧团自己卖座，汽车就要的少。
    四要保吃，厂内要招待一次夜餐。有些剧团的领导人和主要演员还不肯同一般演员一桌吃饭，得另席招待。在西北某工地巡回演出的一个剧团，还要求吃西餐。
    以上这些条件，就使许多工厂和工地无法请国营剧团来演戏，有些合乎条件的，请一次国营剧团也很不容易。石景山钢铁厂的工人们说：有名的剧团请不来；有时死求活恳请来了，有些名演员却不来；有时指名请求，名演员来了，只唱一小折亮亮台，其余的戏都让一般演员去唱。工人说：“这是烟袋锅一头热，你想看他，他不想看你。”
    工人们普遍要求剧团“多卖点力气，少摆点架子；多带点戏来，少带点布景”。
    工人们认为国营剧团所以脱离工人群众，首先因为剧团本身过于庞大，演出和布景过于复杂。由此产生了“看利过重”的观点。工人们认为应该去追查指导思想和经营方针。文化主管部门不从精简剧团、克服浪费入手解决这个问题，就只有提高票价。有些剧团愿意把对工人的演出票价放低些，用多卖座的办法增加收入，文化主管部门却不答应，生怕影响其他剧场的上座率。上海虹口区一个剧团到一个工厂去演出，工厂方面要求剧团放低票价，同时保证多卖座，使剧团总收入增加。剧团同意了，但文化局坚持“国营牌价”不能随便降低，结果只好作罢。包头和西北的工人说：北京、上海的剧团到那里去演出，路远旅费多，票价自然要高。国家可否给剧团适当补助，鼓励他们下厂巡回演出？这样总比白窝在城里好。
      缺乏依靠群众的观点
    石景山钢铁厂的工人认为：只靠专业剧团来演出，无论如何满足不了各地工人的要求，只有靠工人业余剧团的活动，才能解决这个问题。石景山钢铁厂每周都有周末晚会，演出的节目很多，都是由工人的业余剧团来演出。石景山钢铁厂工人们有京剧队、话剧队、评剧队、乐队、说唱等，都是业余的。其中京剧队最活跃，成绩也很好。原因是中国京剧院给予了多方面的帮助，特别是对演员的辅导。提起中国京剧院来，工人们至今称谢不尽。青年艺术剧院对石景山钢铁厂的话剧队给了许多帮助，工人们也念念不忘。
    可是一般工人业余剧团大都因得不到辅导，处于自生自灭的状态。工人们对这很有意见。他们说1954年以前，专业剧团的人对业余剧团的辅导挺积极，现在都不管了，都说没有这任务。通过组织手续根本解决不了这个问题，但通过私人关系，却能解决一部分。例如北京市西单区一个业余评剧团，请不到人辅导，后来知道有一个评剧团的导演张菊荣家就在附近住，上门一请，就解决了问题。西单区一个业余剧团，请求北京人民艺术剧院帮助辅导，被拒绝了，后来通过西单区文化馆一个工作人员，才把他在北京人民艺术剧院工作的爱人找来帮助辅导。
    现在业余剧团活动有两大困难：一是没人辅导，一是缺乏剧本。辅导问题只靠专业剧团也不能全部解决，还得靠文化主管部门认真考虑解决这个问题。关于剧本供应，有些专业剧团有适于业余剧团演出的剧本，却不肯供给。天津一个工厂的业余剧团，向一个剧团借用剧本，剧团不给。这个工厂就派了四个人去看戏，一面看一面记场次和台词，回去凑成剧本演出。工人们也要求文化主管部门注意组织创作，解决对业余剧团的剧本供应问题。
    文化部门并没有充分利用工会方面的文化设施。北京市有十三所工人俱乐部，都能演出戏剧。但北京市文化局在分派剧团时，为了照顾国营剧场的收入，对这些俱乐部采取了限制的方针。不但国营剧团很少派来，就是民营专业剧团也很少派来。原因是俱乐部对工人票价实行优待，说这会拉国营剧场的座。据西单区工人俱乐部的负责人说：5月份文化局没有给西单区工人俱乐部派一场戏。4月份原也没有派，说是剧团全派好了，以后再说吧。后来这个同志知道有些民间专业剧团窝在家里没有场所演出，就先去和这些剧团商量好，再去找文化局，这才派得了两场戏。
    工人们要求文化主管部门在整风中，围绕着文艺为工农兵服务这一方针来进行检查，着重检查两个方面：一个是为群众服务的观点如何？一是依靠群众的观点如何？通过这些检查再进一步揭发领导上的官僚主义、教条主义和宗派主义，并采取有效措施加以克服。
