At a symposium continued by the responsible persons of various democratic parties at the United Front Work Department
Raising sharp criticisms and positive suggestions for improving work

(Our dispatch) The United Front Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China invited responsible persons from various democratic parties and non-party democratic individuals to continue their symposium on the afternoon of the 15th.

Those who spoke at the symposium included non-party democratic personage Ma Yinchu, Central Standing Committee member of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang Chen Mingshu, non-party democratic personage Shen Yanbing, Central Standing Committee member and Director of the Women's Committee of the China Democratic League Liu Qingyang, Secretary-General of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang Mei Gongbin, and non-party democratic personage Zhang Xiruo.

Ma Yinchu said: Democratic parties also need to dismantle "walls," and the school Party committee system cannot withdraw from schools.

In his speech, Ma Yinchu said: Some criticisms are not sufficiently factual, and there is a phenomenon of negating everything. He believes that, starting from the desire for unity, one cannot only talk about the bad aspects without mentioning any of the good ones. For example, in the current criticisms of Peking University, the bad aspects are described in detail, but the good aspects are not mentioned at all. This is not convincing and makes it difficult to work together. When Voroshilov came to visit, he kept praising Peking University. If these good aspects are not discussed, it is not starting from the desire for unity, nor is it a gentle breeze and fine rain. Speaking on this issue, Ma Yinchu believes that the school Party committee system has its advantages. He used Peking University as an example, saying: Peking University has eight thousand regular students, and the Party committee knows the thoughts and family circumstances of these eight thousand regular students. If the Party committee withdraws, I will not be able to understand this, and I will not be able to manage as president. Moreover, if I manage too much, I will not be able to study Russian, do research work, climb mountains, or exercise my body. He also said: In my opinion, the professors at Peking University are close to the Communist Party because they have all personally seen the benefits of the Communist Party. As long as the Communist Party approaches them, they will definitely be willing to cooperate with the Party. At this point, he said: It is wrong to simply criticize the Party committee system as bad. The good aspects of the Party committee system should also be praised. "Walls" must be dismantled from both the Communist Party and the democratic parties and non-party individuals. It is not enough to rely on one side to dismantle them. Ma Yinchu also reviewed the situation at Peking University before liberation. He said: I taught there for sixteen years. At that time, teachers gave lectures without an outline or plan. No one cared if a year's worth of lessons were not completed. The exams consisted of a few questions, and there was no invigilation. Students were essentially copying from books during the exams. Now it is different. The teaching reform has been basically completed, and there are teaching plans and teaching outlines. These are all benefits of the Party committee system. Some people say: During the "suppression of counter-revolutionaries" and "three-anti" campaigns, Communist Party members scolded non-Party members, and non-Party members suffered a lot. Now they can vent their anger by only talking about the bad aspects and not the good ones. Ma Yinchu believes: Communist Party members also suffered a lot and need to vent their anger! When will this anger be vented? And what if they become passive? Are we asking them to be active? I cannot be active. If that is the case, the problem will be even bigger. Some people now say that it is good to restore the school affairs committee. This school affairs committee existed in the past, but if it is not handled well, the president and vice-president will argue over the budget and even stop talking to each other. Some people thought that Tsinghua University's school affairs committee was well-run, but several professors who used to be at Tsinghua University and are now at Peking University said: "The school affairs committee at Tsinghua University in the past was a committee of bullies. We suffered a lot. Why would we say it was good?" Comparing the past with the present, Ma Yinchu concluded: The Party committee system in schools cannot withdraw from schools under any circumstances. However, Ma Yinchu also believes that the current situation must change. As long as the Party and the administration cooperate, are open and honest, and communicate with each other, he believes it can be done well.

Ma Yinchu also mentioned that the old professors in the schools could not take the stage in the past, but now, after a criticism, the situation has been reversed, and it is said that the young teaching assistants are dogmatic and do not believe in them, and even the Soviet experts are not believed in. The old professors have a lot of things to do, such as scientific research, supervising graduate students, and some even need to be released from production to write books. What will happen in the future? This is a big problem. This is not only the case at Peking University, but also a problem in Shanghai. In the past, it was said to learn from the working class, but now what is there to learn from the working class? Some people even say that the fixed interest for industrialists and businessmen should be fixed for twenty years. This tendency is not good. At this point, Ma Yinchu said again: Therefore, the wall must be dismantled from both sides. It is not enough to dismantle only one side. The Communist Party's rectification campaign is dismantling the "wall." Although the number of new Party members has increased, the rectification of these new Party members is probably not as easy as that of the old Party members who have gone through struggles. However, they have wise leadership and can still be rectified. The democratic parties, such as the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, the China Democratic League, the China National Democratic Construction Association, and the Jiusan Society, although not as easy to rectify as the Communist Party, still have organizational structures and are relatively easy to rectify. We non-party democratic individuals do not even have an organization, like a vast ocean. Who will rectify us? Who is being rectified? Whose words have the most authority and can convince the people being rectified? How will the rectification be carried out? How will the walls be dismantled? These are all problems. Regarding this issue, when the reporter interviewed him after the meeting, he asked the reporter to add the following paragraph: Therefore, I advocated abolishing this non-party democratic individual party two years ago, but the fraternal parties disagreed. Now I hope that young people will not join it. When these old fellows die, this non-party party will also disappear. Otherwise, it will be even worse to "coexist for a long time."

Chen Mingshu said:
The Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang has no "walls" to dismantle.

After Ma Yinchu's speech, Chen Mingshu added that he agreed with the implementation of the school affairs committee and the abolition of the Party committee system in schools. If the Party committee system in schools is abolished in the future, it will be necessary to strengthen the united front work and organize the school affairs committee under the principle of democracy under leadership. As for the issue of dismantling walls from each other, he said that the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang has no walls to dismantle. He also said that the nature of the Party group in the organs and the Party committee in the schools is different, so he does not agree with abolishing the Party group in the organs.

Shen Yanbing said:
Sectarianism, dogmatism, and bureaucracy are mutually causal and interconnected.

Shen Yanbing spoke on the issues of sectarianism, dogmatism, and bureaucracy. He believes that these three are indeed interconnected and mutually causal. Because you monopolize everything, you do not discuss anything with him, or you only teach him to nod in agreement, then he will be created into a bureaucrat. Also, because sectarianists are often also serious dogmatists, the result will inevitably make them hardworking bureaucrats themselves, and they will have to force others to become such bureaucrats. All of this stems from a lack of democracy, and developing democracy is the right medicine to eliminate these three bad things. Shen Yanbing also said: United front work and sectarianism are incompatible. The United Front Work Department has done a lot of work, but it has not reduced sectarianism in various aspects. What is the reason? In terms of personnel arrangements, the facts have proved that after non-Party members are arranged, sectarianism does not decrease, and even new growth occurs. Moreover, from another perspective, this has nurtured a group of bureaucrats. For example, many experts have been given too many concurrent positions, so they are busy with "three meetings" (lengthy meetings, banquets, evening parties), neglecting their main duties, and have to become busy bureaucrats. He cited his own example, saying: I am not an expert personally, but I used to have a specialty. What about now? I am both a nominal head of a people's organization and an official. Sometimes people still regard me as a freelancer (writer). I myself do not know what I am. In the eyes of the Writers Association, I am a nominal person, busy with other things all day long, neglecting my main duties (writing); in the eyes of the Ministry of Culture, I am also just a nominal person, busy with other things all day long, neglecting my main duties. If I were a strong man, I could strive to "make progress," holding a pen in my left hand and a seal in my right hand. But I am not, and my foundation is poor. At a continuous meeting of three or four hours, I end up not seeing or hearing. There are probably many people like me who neglect their main duties. The United Front Work Department should rearrange things.

Shen Yanbing also said: The manifestations of sectarianism are diverse. For example, a non-Party expert makes a suggestion in business, but the leading Party member in charge does not comment. Then the non-Party expert feels that the Party member leader is sectarian. However, in my opinion, this is a false accusation against that Party member. In fact, this Party member is not proficient in business, does not know whether the non-Party expert's suggestion is good or bad, and is unwilling to honestly admit that he does not understand (because if he admits that he does not understand, he will lose face), so he has no choice but to make no comment. There is indeed no sectarianism here. However, after a period of time, the upper-level Party member makes the same proposal. At this time, the Party member who once made no comment will raise both hands high, vigorously publicize, and praise the upper-level Party member's wise leadership, but will never mention that a certain non-Party expert once made basically the same suggestion. Did he forget? I don't think so. It is still because to maintain face, it is better not to mention it. Here, there is sectarianism. If the non-Party expert is not sensible and explains that he also had such a suggestion but was not taken seriously, then 90% of the time, the Party member will quibble, saying that the expert's suggestion is fundamentally different from the upper-level's instructions this time, or even give him a label: slandering the leader, slandering the Party. Here, sectarianism develops to an extremely serious level. From such examples, can we say that pretending to understand when you don't, and being preoccupied with face, is what promotes the sectarianism mentioned above? However, this situation can usually be called bureaucracy, so it can be seen that the two are somewhat related.

Then, Shen Yanbing talked about bureaucracy, saying: The manifestations of bureaucracy are also diverse. As far as I can see, the bureaucracy of several central ministries belongs to the hard-working bureaucracy. The characteristics of this bureaucracy are: only grasping small things, doing everything personally, while being ignorant of the overall situation; only considering the present, without considering the future, which is the inevitable result of being ignorant of the overall situation; busy with the arrangements for oil, salt, soy sauce, and vinegar, neglecting ideological leadership, which is particularly prominent in cultural and educational departments. This bureaucracy is the most terrible. The root cause of this bureaucracy is a subjective and dogmatic way of thinking, and the soil that breeds this bureaucracy is unfamiliarity with business and even being an amateur. Taking literature and art as an example, it is a specialized subject after all. Without the foundation of this subject, relying solely on a few "must-read books for cadres" cannot solve the specific problems in business. If you cannot solve it, but you are waiting for you to make decisions, what should you do? The shortcut is: dogmatism, administrative orders. For a period of time, leaders who did not have knowledge but relied on dogmatism used various labels to suppress those who made suggestions, so that those who were less infected with dogmatism also stepped up their study of dogmatism, and the result was called "progress." Shen Yanbing believes: Whether this period is gone forever, I dare not say so.

Shen Yanbing concluded: In short, sectarianism and dogmatism are mainly ideological problems, which must be solved ideologically, but are also related to low levels of knowledge and unfamiliarity with business. Bureaucracy, such as the hard-working bureaucracy, is mainly or mostly due to unfamiliarity with business. It is not enough to just understand the situation. Even if you understand the situation of a certain business and know the differences in opinions among experts, but you do not have this knowledge, you cannot come up with your own opinions, so you will be indecisive, listening to A's words today and B's words tomorrow. Subjectively, you want to do things well, but objectively, it is bureaucracy. Therefore, Shen Yanbing hopes that in the rectification campaign, all kinds of learning systems, including political and ideological and business-related, will be thoroughly examined, and those formalistic learning methods that waste time in vain will be completely changed. Shen Yanbing believes that this is a very important issue.

Liu Qingyang said:
Not only exposing, but also putting forward active suggestions.
I hope that the united front work will not only unite men but not women

Liu Qingyang said in her speech that Ma Yinchu said that he could not only talk about the shortcomings of the Communist Party without talking about the advantages, and that the Party committee system in schools could not be abolished. I think this opinion should be considered carefully by all democratic parties, and we should try to make the members of the democratic parties who are working in various fields not only expose contradictions, but also put forward constructive suggestions for solving contradictions. I don't think we can make Party members passive or wronged, because exposing contradictions is to solve contradictions and to unite more.

The problem of having a position without power mentioned by everyone a few days ago is universally reflected in the people I have come into contact with. However, this problem does not exist for me. Because I have always expressed my opinions if I have them, and of course this is also gained from struggle. However, whether I can seriously exercise my powers has become a problem, because there are too many concurrent positions. I myself hold positions such as deputy to the National People's Congress, member of the CPPCC, deputy to the People's Congress of Hebei Province, and member of the CPPCC. Every year, it takes several months to attend meetings and inspections, so I cannot do the work of the Red Cross Society that I am responsible for, which has caused serious bureaucracy. I think that too many concurrent positions are a drain on the individual and are not conducive to work. Therefore, I hope that in personnel arrangements, it is not necessary to arrange too many positions to satisfy people. The main thing is to ask them to concentrate on doing one or two jobs well, so that they can exert their strength for the construction of socialism.

Some people do not voluntarily become bureaucrats, but the environment forces them to create bureaucracy in all aspects. For example, I have been working in the Red Cross Society for two and a half years. Although the cadres in our association want to do the work of the Red Cross Society well, they cannot get the support of the Party and the government in their work. For example, the work plan proposal has not been resolved for three or four years. It was first submitted to the Ministry of Health, and then submitted to the State Council, but it has not been approved yet, which has affected everyone's emotions. Therefore, the Party and non-Party cadres in our association have a lot of opinions on the fact that their work is not valued. We believe that the leaders do not value mass organizations, so we seem like children without mothers, and we cannot exert our enthusiasm, and the work cannot be carried out. Can this be considered bureaucracy?

Liu Qingyang then said, I want to stand in the position of women to reflect some opinions for everyone. Some female cadres told me that everyone has expressed their opinions on all aspects of the problem, but not enough attention has been paid to women's work. In terms of united front policy, some people say that they unite the top but not the bottom, unite a few people, and do not care about the middle and lower levels. For women, they unite men but not women, which seems not comprehensive and thorough enough. For example, our Women's Federation has done a lot of work before and after liberation, both underground and aboveground. The responsible comrades of the All-China Women's Federation and the Municipal Women's Federation all know this. However, in terms of leadership, we have not been given care and encouragement. To this day, our very few cadres who are released from production are still black cadres, without formal personnel establishment and welfare benefits. Cadres sometimes say, are we not also working for the country? We have no one to care about our work achievements, but sometimes we are looked down upon by the street women's federations with organized leadership, saying that we are bourgeois women's organizations.

Liu Qingyang also seriously criticized some bad phenomena in marriage issues. She said that some agricultural cooperatives in Hebei Province tried to train some female tractor drivers, but after they married officers stationed in the local army, they stopped being tractor drivers, left production, and lived in the army. They put on leather shoes and silk clothes and drove home in cars. This has had a very bad impact on rural cadres and farmers. Liu Qingyang said that this is not the road to women's liberation, but a phenomenon of ideological regression.

Some comrades of the China Democratic League in Hebei have reflected some situations and opinions to me. For example, some people say that the work of the United Front Work Department unites the top but not the bottom, only values a few upper-level figures, and does not care about the middle and lower levels. Therefore, the responsible person of the Party committee at the grassroots level does not understand the role of the democratic parties. For example, a Party member vice-president of a school in Tangshan said: "I understand the situation of the democratic parties. Let's have a competition in the future. If you do well, we will let you do it." After he said this, the teachers in the school were not willing to join the China Democratic League anymore. For example, Tangshan Railway College was originally a key experimental point for united front work, but in reality the Party and non-Party were still nominally in harmony but actually not. For example, the seven Party committee comrades, due to their lack of understanding of teaching reform and the formulation of teaching outlines, inevitably often said amateurish things. They did not humbly learn from intellectuals, so they caused conflicts, and the relationship between the Party and the masses was not good. For example, some Party member comrades are experts in carrying 500 kilometers with a full load and over-axis, but if you ask them to engage in university education, they have no common language with senior intellectuals, of course it is very difficult, and intellectuals cannot talk to them. So there is a gap, which is incompatible. If the democratic parties want to help make something, they also need to experiment step by step, and dare not say it and do it. The Party also dare not manage the democratic parties too much, for fear of infringing on their independence. Therefore, the relationship between the Party and the democratic parties is very subtle. When the two sides cannot be open and honest with each other, they cannot avoid estrangement and contradictions.

Mei Gongbin said:
In personnel arrangements, we must make the democratic parties have a name and reality

Mei Gongbin talked about the opinions of the central leaders of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang and the cadres at all levels of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang on the united front work.

First of all, on the issue of cooperative work, he said that democratic people have not yet been able to participate from "rehearsal" to "performance," from "design" to "construction." He believes that the joint instructions issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party and the State Council and the "Party replacing the government" below the county level are not appropriate.

Regarding the issue of employment arrangements, Mei Gongbin said that some people analyze that there are three situations: first, having a position without power; second, having a name without reality; third, having no name and no reality. He said that in his opinion, the phenomenon of having a position without power is extremely common in institutions and schools; but in the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, the serious problems are still having a name without reality and having neither "name" nor "reality."

Mei Gongbin also proposed that the deputies to the People's Congress and the members of the CPPCC do not need to hold concurrent positions, but should be separated to make the arrangement broader. He believes that future personnel arrangements at all levels should not be limited to people with old qualifications, but should take care of people with shallow qualifications but good work achievements.

Mei Gongbin also criticized the shortcomings of some newspapers' lack of attention to the publicity and reports of the activities of the democratic parties. For example, the report on the Second Plenary Session of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang was only published on the fourth page of the People's Daily.

Regarding the relationship between the grassroots organizations of the democratic parties and the grassroots Party committees of the Communist Party of China, Mei Gongbin said that the task of the grassroots organizations of the democratic parties is to represent the interests of their members and play a supervisory role, but because they cannot participate in many local work, they cannot fulfill their tasks. Mei Gongbin believes that the relationship between the grassroots organizations of the democratic parties and the grassroots organizations of the Communist Party of China is equal, and accepting leadership is accepting political leadership. If the two sides disagree at the grassroots level, they can report to their superiors separately for consultation and handling.

Mei Gongbin also talked about the opinions of the middle-level and lower-level cadres of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang on the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. He said that the cadres of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang require the United Front Work Department to give them more help in the future. The middle-level personnel of the central government also hope to have the opportunity to participate in various meetings and inspections. Mei Gongbin also requested to change the past situation where the political treatment of the deputy ministers of the democratic parties was "inferior to others."

Finally, Mei Gongbin put forward four suggestions, including improving the relationship between the Party and non-Party members. He hoped that through this rectification campaign, the deep-rooted sectarianism of Party member cadres at all levels would be overcome, so as to correctly solve the mutual relations of grassroots organizations and the issue of having positions and power for democratic people in institutions, schools, and enterprises.

Zhang Xiruo spoke about the four deviations of being fond of greatness and success, being eager for quick success and instant benefit, despising the past, and being superstitious about the future.

Zhang Xiruo said that he talked about the three major isms last time, and today he will talk about the four deviations. These four deviations are: first, being fond of greatness and success; second, being eager for quick success and instant benefit; third, despising the past; and fourth, being superstitious about the future.

He said that being fond of greatness and success is divided into two aspects. The first is the greatness of form, and the other is the greatness of organization. The greatness of form is the most prominent. Many people believe that modern things must be big, and being big is in line with modern standards. Taking some new buildings in Beijing as an example, the new building of the Beijing Hotel, the auditorium, the dormitory building of the Military Commission on Jing Hill Back Street, the office building of the "Four Ministries and One Commission" in the western suburbs, and the Wangfujing Department Store, these seem to be very magnificent from the outside, but they are not very useful in practice. Many people are not very clear about the concept of "greatness." Greatness is a moral concept, a concept of quality, not a concept of quantity. The size of the volume and the size of the dimensions are not equal to spiritual greatness. Big is big, and great is great. These two things are not equal. However, they misunderstand the greatness of form as the greatness of quality, and the greatness of dimensions as greatness. The other is the greatness of organization, which is huge. Many people call huge great. In their eyes, socialism is equal to collectivism, collectivism is equal to concentration, concentration is equal to big, and big is equal to not wanting small. Because of this basic idea, industrial and commercial organizations must be large, cultural and artistic organizations must be large, and the organizational form of life and entertainment must also be large. Regardless of the people's lives and consumers' needs, only the large scale of the organization is enjoyable. Originally, these industrial, commercial, and social organizations were all to serve the people, but now this method does not care about the actual needs of the people, as if the people are serving them.

Why do these people like big things? In addition to not separating the greatness of size from spiritual greatness as just mentioned, there is also a manifestation of naivety and a manifestation of muddled thinking and simple minds.

Second, being eager for quick success and instant benefit. This attitude seems to be inconsistent with being fond of greatness and success, but in fact, on the one hand, it is being fond of greatness and success, and on the other hand, it is being eager for quick success and instant benefit. One manifestation of being eager for quick success and instant benefit is emphasizing crash programs. Crash programs are needed in some cases, but if you use the method of crash programs to do long-term things, the result will not be good. Things should be divided into long-term and temporary, and the century-old plan and the ten-year plan are different. Being eager for quick success and instant benefit is not only the case for tangible things, but also for intangible things, especially for profound knowledge. The current method of training talents in colleges and universities does not seem to fully recognize this. It is thought that after graduating from university and becoming an associate doctor and doctor, it is almost the same, but in fact, except for a few individuals, the average is still far behind. This is the case with old knowledge, and the same is true with new knowledge.

Third, despising the past. History is inherited, and human wisdom has been accumulated over a long period of time. However, many people have ignored historical factors and have moved all kinds of foreign dogmas. They regard many things left over from history as feudal and want to overthrow them all. They think that when new things come, old things cannot but be overthrown. In fact, our history has left us with a rich cultural heritage, but they know very little about Chinese history and the new society.

Fourth, being superstitious about the future. Of course, the future will be better than the present. But it cannot be said that everything in the future is developing. Some things in the future will develop, some will stagnate, some will regress, and some will disappear. Development is also uneven, not a mechanical development at equal speed. In short, future things are not all developing indiscriminately, regardless of whether they are big or small. Therefore, it is wrong to deny the past and be superstitious about the future.

After talking about these four deviations, Zhang Xiruo said that, of course, it is not to say that big things are not good, old things are all good, and future things are all bad. The problem is to have distinctions, to have appropriate proportions, and to have coordination. Life is not monotonous, so don't have simple minds. He said that this is a very unfortunate thing for people with high culture, and it is also a great burden for mental workers. But this is not a difficult thing to do. As long as you are humble, you can do it.

The symposium will continue on the 16th.

    各民主党派负责人在统战部继续召开的座谈会上
    提出尖锐批评和改进工作的积极建议
    本报讯　中共中央统一战线工作部15日下午邀请各民主党派负责人和无党派民主人士继续座谈。
    在座谈会上先后发言的有无党派民主人士马寅初，中国国民党革命委员会中央常务委员陈铭枢，无党派民主人士沈雁冰，中国民主同盟中央常务委员兼妇委主任刘清扬，中国国民党革命委员会中央秘书长梅龚彬，无党派民主人士张奚若。马寅初说：民主党派也要拆“墙”学校党委制不能退出学校
    马寅初在发言中说：目前有些批评不够实事求是，有否定一切的现象。他认为：从团结的愿望出发，不能光讲坏处，好处一点不说，如现在对北京大学的批评，坏的地方说得很详细，好的地方一点也不说，这是无法令人心服的，也不好共事。伏罗希洛夫这次来参观就一直称赞北京大学，如果这些好处都不谈，就不是从团结的愿望出发，也不是和风细雨。在谈到这个问题的时候，马寅初认为学校党委制有他的好处，他还以北京大学为例，他说：北大有八千个正规生，这八千个正规生的思想、家庭情况，党委都知道。如果党委退出去，我是无法了解的，叫我做校长，我也管不了，而且我管得多了，俄文也不能念了，研究工作也不能作了，山也不能爬了，身体也不能锻炼了。他还说：照我想，北京大学的教授是靠近共产党的，因为他们都亲眼看到共产党的好处，只要共产党接近他们，他们一定愿与党合作。谈到这里，他说：单纯批评党委制不好是不对的，党委制好的地方也要表扬。“墙”必须从共产党和民主党派、无党派人士两方面拆，单靠一方面拆是不成的。马寅初还回顾了解放前北京大学的情况，他说：我在那里教了十六年书，那时先生讲课没有大纲，没有计划，一年的功课不讲完，也无人过问，考试出几个题目，也不来监考，学生考试等于是抄书。现在不同了，教学改革已基本完成，有了教学计划、教学大纲。这都是党委制的好处。有人说：从前“肃反”、“三反”时，共产党员骂非党人士，非党人士受了一肚子气，现在只讲坏处，不讲好处，可以出气了。马寅初认为：共产党员受了一肚子气，也要出气呀！这个气到什么时候出呢？而且一旦消极起来，又怎样办呢？叫我们积极吗？我就积极不起来，那样，问题更大了。现在有人说恢复校务委员会好，这个校务委员会过去也有，但是，弄得不好，院长和院长为争预算要闹意见，甚至不说话，也曾有人认为清华大学校务委员会搞得好，可是曾经在清华大学而现在在北京大学的几位教授就说：“过去清华大学的校务委员会是把头委员会，我们吃过苦，怎么还说好呢？”比比过去，看看现在，马寅初得出结论说：学校中的党委制无论如何不能退出学校。但是，马寅初同时认为：现在的情况也要改变，只要党与行政合作，开诚布公，互通声气，他相信一定可以办得好。
    马寅初还谈到：过去学校里的老教授上不了台，现在，一批评就翻过来了，说青年助教是教条主义，不相信他们，甚至连苏联专家也不相信；老教授事情又多得很，要进行科学研究、带研究生，有些人还要脱产编书，那里有功夫去上课，将来怎么办呢？这个问题就大了。不但在北京大学如此，在上海更成问题，过去说向工人阶级学习，现在说向工人阶级学习什么？甚至还有人说：工商界定息要定二十年，这种倾向不好。谈到这里，马寅初再次说到：所以墙要从两方面拆，单拆一面是不行的。共产党整风就是拆“墙”，虽然现在新党员增加了，这些新党员整风恐怕不及经过斗争的老党员来得容易，但是，他们有英明的领导，还是可以整的。各民主党派，如民革、民盟、民建、九三学社整风，虽然没有共产党容易，但是，他们有组织机构，也还容易整，我们无党派民主人士连个机构也没有，像汪洋大海一样，谁去整呢？被整的是谁呢？谁说话最有威信，可以使被整的人信服呢？怎么整法呢？也就是怎么拆墙呢？都是问题。关于这个问题，会后，记者在访问他的时候，他要记者加上这样一段：所以无党派民主人士这个党派我在二年前就主张取消，但是，兄弟党不同意，现在我希望青年别加进去，这班老头儿死光，无党派这个党派也没有了，否则要“长期共存”，就更糟糕了。
    陈铭枢说：
    民革没有“墙”可拆
    陈铭枢在马寅初发言后补充说，我是同意实行校务委员会，取消学校中的党委制。今后学校中的党委制如果取消的话，就要加强统战工作，就更有必要在有领导下的民主这个原则下组织校务委员会。至于互相拆墙的问题，他说民革方面是没有什么墙可拆的。他还说，机关中党组与学校中的党委会性质不同，因此，他不赞成取消机关中的党组。
    沈雁冰说：
    宗派主义、教条主义、官僚主义是互为因果互相关联的
    沈雁冰就宗派主义、教条主义和官僚主义问题做了发言，他认为：这三者实在是互相关联、互为因果的。因为你既包办一切，任何事都不跟他商量，或只教他画诺，那他就被造成为官僚主义。又如：由于宗派主义者，常常又是严重的教条主义者，结果就必然使他自己成为辛辛苦苦的官僚主义者，而且要强迫别人不得不成为这样的官僚主义者。所有这一切，其根源又是由于缺乏民主，开展民主是消除这三个坏东西的对症药。沈雁冰还说：统战工作和宗派主义是不相容的，统战部做了不少工作，然而并没有减少各方面的宗派主义。其原因何在呢？就人事安排来说，事实证明：党外人士得到安排以后，宗派主义并不减少，甚至有了新的滋长，并且，从另一方面看，这又滋长了、培养了一批官僚主义者。例如：不少专家就因为安排给他们的兼职太多了，以至于忙于“三会”
  （冗长的会议、宴会、晚会），不务正业，不得不做个忙忙碌碌的官僚主义者。他举了他自己的例子，他说：我个人不是专家，不过从前也还有个专业；现在呢？又是人民团体的挂名负责人，又是官，有时人家又仍然把我看作一个自由职业者（作家），我自己也不知道究竟算什么。在作家协会看来，我是挂名的，成天忙于别事，不务正业（写作）；在文化部看来，我也只挂挂名，成天忙于别事，不务正业。如果我是个壮丁，还可以力求“上进”，左手执笔，右手掌印，无奈我又不是，而且底子又差，三、四小时连续的会议，到后来就视而不见，听而不闻了。像我这样不务正业的人大概不少，统战部最好再安排一下。
    沈雁冰还说：宗派主义的表现方式是多种多样的，比方说：一个非党专家，在业务上提了个建议，可是主管的领导党员却不置可否，于是非党专家觉得这位党员领导者有宗派主义。可是，在我看来，这是冤枉了那位党员了。事实上，这位党员不精于业务，对于那位非党专家的建议不辨好歹，而又不肯老实承认自己不懂（因为若自认不懂，便有伤威信），只好不置可否，这里确实并无宗派主义。可是，隔了一个时期，上级党员也提出同样的主张来了，这时候，曾经不置可否的党员，就双手高举，大力宣扬，称颂上级党员英明领导，但是，压根儿不提某非党专家曾经提过基本上相同的建议，是不是他忘记了呢？我看不是，仍然是因为若要保住威信，不提为妙。在这里，就有了宗派主义，如果那位非党专家不识相，自己来说明他也有过那样的建议，但未被重视，于是乎百分之九十很可能，那位党员会强词夺理，说那位专家的建议基本上和这次上级的指示不同，或甚至给他一个帽子：诽谤领导，诽谤党。这里，宗派主义就发展到极严重的地步。从这样的例子，是不是可以说：不懂装懂，念念不忘于什么威信，就是促成了像上面所说的宗派主义，但是，通常可以把这种情况称之为官僚主义，可见两者有点亲戚关系。
    接着，沈雁冰谈到官僚主义，他说：官僚主义的表现方式也是多种多样的。据我所见，中央几个部的官僚主义是属于辛辛苦苦的官僚主义。这种官僚主义的特征是：?只抓小事，事必躬亲，而昧于全局形势；?只顾到眼前的，没有考虑到将来，这是昧于全局的必然结果；?忙于油、盐、酱、醋的安排，忽略了思想领导，这在文教部门尤为显著。这种官僚主义最可怕，这个官僚主义产生的根源是主观主义、教条主义的思想方法，而滋长这种官僚主义的土壤却是对于业务的生疏乃至于外行。拿文学艺术来说，究竟是专门学问，没有这门学问的基础，专靠几本“干部必读”不能解决业务上的具体问题，不能解决，可又等着你作主张，怎么办呢？捷径是：教条主义、行政命令。有一个时期，没有学问而靠教条主义办事的领导者，用各种帽子来压服提意见的人，使得本来沾染教条主义比较少的人也加紧学习教条主义，而结果反被称为“进步”。沈雁冰认为：这个时期是不是一去不复返了，还不敢这样说。
    沈雁冰最后说：总而言之，宗派主义、教条主义主要是个思想问题，要从思想上解决，然而也同知识水平低、业务不通有关系。而官僚主义，如就辛辛苦苦的官僚主义而言，则主要是或大部是业务不通之故。光了解情况还不够，你尽管了解某一业务的情况，知道专家们的意见分歧，但你没有这门学问，拿不出自己的主张，于是就会举棋不定，今天听甲的话，明天听乙的话，主观上要把事办好，客观上却是官僚主义。因此，沈雁冰期望在整风中，切实检查一下所有的各种方式的学习制度，包括政治思想的和业务的，彻底改变那些徒然耗费时间的形式主义的学习方法。沈雁冰认为这是一个很重要的问题。刘清扬说：
    不只是揭露，也要提出积极性的建议。
    希望统战工作不要只统男不统女
    刘清扬在发言中说马寅初说不能光讲共产党的缺点，不讲优点，学校中的党委制不能取消。我觉得这个意见各民主党派应该很好考虑，应设法让在各方面担任工作的民主党派成员不光是揭露矛盾，也要提出解决矛盾的建设性意见。我觉得不能使党员消极，不能使党员受委屈，因为揭露矛盾是为了解决矛盾，是为了更加团结。
    大家前几天提到的有职无权问题，在我所接触过的人中，都反映普遍地是存在着这个问题。但是，这个问题对我来说并不存在。因为，我向来是有意见就提的，当然这也是从斗争中得来的。但是，我能不能认真行使自己的职权呢？这倒成了问题，因为兼职太多了。我自己身兼全国人民代表大会代表、政协委员、河北省人民代表、政协委员等职，每年光开会、视察就要花去好几个月时间，我本身所担负的红十字会工作就没法作，造成了严重的官僚主义。我觉得兼职过多对个人是个消耗，对工作也不利。因此，我希望在人事的安排上，并不必要安排太多的职位，才能使人满足，主要的还是要叫他集中精力做好一两件工作，能为建设社会主义发挥他的力量。
    有些人并不自愿成为官僚主义者，但环境竟逼得他在各方面都造成了官僚主义。如我到红十字会工作两年半了，虽然我们会中的干部对红十字会的工作都想作好，但是由于工作上得不到党政的支持，如工作计划方案问题，已有三、四年之久不得解决，先提到卫生部，后提到国务院至今还未批下来，这就影响了大家的情绪。因此，我们会里党和非党干部对自己工作不被重视的情况都很有意见。我们认为领导不重视群众团体，因此使我们好像一个没有妈妈的孩子，有积极性也无从发挥，工作不能开展，这能算是官僚主义吗？
    刘清扬接着说，我要站在妇女立场代表大家反映些意见。有些妇女干部向我说，各方面的问题都有人提意见，就是对妇女工作重视不够。对统战政策来说，有人说统上不统下，统少数人，不关心中下层，在妇女来说，是统男不统女，这就显得不够全面和周密。如我们妇女联谊会从解放前后，地下和地上都做了不少工作，全国妇联和市妇联的负责同志都是知道的。但在领导上，既未给以关怀和鼓励，至今我们极少数的脱产干部，始终是黑干部，并无正式的人员编制和福利待遇。干部们有时说，我们不也是为国家工作么？我们既无人关心工作的成绩，反而有时还被有组织领导的街道妇联看不起，说我们是资产阶级的妇女团体。
    刘清扬还严肃地批评了在婚姻问题上一些不良的现象。她说，在河北省有的农业社设法培养了一些女拖拉机手，但是她们同驻在当地部队军官结婚后，就不当拖拉机手，脱离了生产，住到部队里去。她们穿上皮鞋和丝绸衣服，坐汽车回家。这在农村干部和农民中间起了很不好的影响。刘清扬说，这不是妇女解放的道路，这是一种思想倒退的现象。
    河北有些民盟同志向我反映了些情况和意见。如有人说，统战部工作，统上不统下，只重视少数上层人物，不关心中下层。因此，基层党委负责人，不了解民主党派的作用。如唐山某一学校党员副校长说：“我懂了民主党派的情况，今后来竞赛吧，你们干好了，我们就让你们搞了。”他这样一讲，该校教员就不好再加入民盟了。又如唐山铁道学院本是统战工作的试验重点，但实际党和非党还是貌合神离。如七个党委同志，对教学改革、拟订教学大纲等，由于他们不懂，就不免常说外行话，他们又不向知识分子虚心学习，于是造成矛盾，党群关系就搞不好。比如有的党员同志搞满载超轴五百公里是内行，但叫他搞大学教育，他和高级知识分子无共同语言，当然很困难，知识分子也无法和他们谈心，于是就形成鸿沟，格格不入。民主党派要想帮助作出点事来，也需要一步步试验，不敢说出来和做出来。党的方面对民主党派也不敢多管，怕侵犯他们的独立，因此，党与民主党派关系很微妙。在双方不能开诚相见时，也就不能避免隔阂和矛盾。梅龚彬说：
    在人事安排上要使  民主党派有名有实
    梅龚彬在会上谈了民革中央领导人和民革各级干部对统一战线工作的意见。
    首先，关于合作共事关系问题，他说，现在民主人士还没有做到从“彩排”到“演出”、从“设计”到“施工”都能参加。他认为共产党中央同国务院发布联合指示、县以下“以党代政”，这些做法都是不尽妥当的。
    关于就业安排问题，梅龚彬说，有人分析有三种情况：第一、有职无权；第二、有名无实；第三、无名无实。他说，在他看来，有职无权现象目前在机关学校中极为普遍；但是在民革方面严重的还是徒有其名而无其实以及“名”“实”都无的问题。
    梅龚彬还提出，人民代表大会代表和政协委员不必兼任，应该分开，使安排的面较广一些。他认为今后各级人事安排应不限于资历老的人，应照顾资历虽浅而工作有成绩的人。
    梅龚彬还批评了一些报纸对民主党派活动的宣传报道不够重视的缺点。如报道民革二中全会会议的稿件，人民日报只登在第四版上。
    关于民主党派基层组织与中共基层党委的关系问题，梅龚彬说，民主党派基层组织的任务是代表成员利益和发挥监督作用，但是由于对地方的许多工作不能与闻其事，这样就无法实现它的任务。梅龚彬认为，民主党派基层组织与中共基层组织之间的关系是平等的，接受领导是接受政治领导，如果在基层双方意见不一致时，可以分别报告上级，协商处理。
    梅龚彬还谈到民革中级干部和下级干部对中共中央统战部的意见。他说，民革的干部要求统战部今后更多地给他们以帮助。中央的中层人员还希望有参加各项会议和视察的机会。梅龚彬还要求改变过去民主党派中央副部长在政治待遇上“低人一等”的情况。
    最后，梅龚彬提出了四点建议，其中关于改进党与非党关系方面，他希望通过这次整风，克服各级党员干部的根深蒂固的宗派主义，以正确解决基层组织的相互关系和机关、学校、企业单位中民主人士的有职有权问题。
    张奚若讲好大喜功、急功近利、鄙视既往、迷信将来的四种偏差
    张奚若说，他上次讲三大主义，今天讲四种偏差。这四种偏差是：第一，好大喜功；第二，急功近利；第三，鄙视既往；第四，迷信将来。
    他说，好大喜功分两方面。第一是大：一种是形体之大，另一种是组织之大。形体之大最突出，很多人认为，近代的东西必须是大的，大了才合乎近代的标准。拿北京的一些新的建筑物来说，北京饭店新楼礼堂，景山后街的军委宿舍大楼，西郊的“四部一会”办公大楼，王府井百货大楼，这些从外表看来，似乎是很堂皇，而实际上并不太合用。很多人对“伟大”的概念不大清楚。伟大是一个道德的概念，是一个质量的概念，不是一个数量的概念。体积上尺寸上的大，并不等于精神上的伟大。大是大，伟大是伟大，这两个东西并不相等。可是，他们把形体之大误会为质量之大，把尺寸之大误会为伟大。另一种是组织之大，就是庞大。很多人把庞大叫做伟大。在他们看来，社会主义等于集体主义，集体主义等于集中，集中等于大，大等于不要小的。由于有这个基本思想，所以工商业组织要大，文化艺术组织要大，生活娱乐组织形式也要大。不管人民的生活和消费者的需要如何，只要组织规模大才过瘾。本来这些工商业和社会组织都是为人民服务的，但现在这个办法不管人民的实际需要，好像人民为他们服务。
    为什么这些人喜大呢？除刚才说的把尺寸上的大和精神上的大未分开而外，还有一种是幼稚的表现，也是思想笼统、脑筋简单的表现。
    第二，急功近利。这个态度与好大喜功似乎是不一致的，实际上一面是好大喜功，另一面又是急功近利。急功近利的一种表现就是强调速成。在某种情况下速成是需要的，但要把长远的事情用速成的办法去作，结果是不会好的，事情应该分长远与一时的，百年大计与十年小计自有不同。急功近利，不但对有形的东西如此，对无形的东西，尤其对高深的学问，也是如此。现在高等学校培养人才的办法，似乎没有充分认识到这一点，以为大学毕业，作了副博士、博士就差不多了，其实除个别人以外，一般的还差得很远。旧学问如此，新学问也如此。
    第三，鄙视既往。历史是有继承性的，人类智慧是长期积累起来的。但许多人却忽视了历史因素，一切都搬用洋教条。他们把历史遗留下来的许多东西看作封建，都要打倒。他们认为，新的来了，旧的不能不打倒。其实，我们的历史给我们留下了丰富的文化遗产，而他们对中国历史和新社会都很少了解。
    第四，迷信将来。当然，将来要比现在好。但不能说将来任何事情都是发展的。将来有的发展，有的停滞，有的后退，有的消灭。而发展也有不平衡的，不是机械地等速度的发展。总之，将来的事情，不是不分青红皂白、事无巨细都是发展的。因此，否定过去，迷信将来，都是不对的。
    张奚若在讲了这四种偏差之后说，当然，不是说大的都不好，过去的都好，将来的都不好，问题在于要有区别，要有适当的比例，要有配合，生活才不单调，不要脑筋简单。他说，这是文化高的人很不幸的事情，也是脑力劳动者的很大的负担。但这也不是什么难办的事情。只要虚心一点，就能够办到。
    座谈会将于16日继续举行。
