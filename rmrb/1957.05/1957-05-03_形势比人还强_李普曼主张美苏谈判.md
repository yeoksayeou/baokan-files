Xinhua News Agency, New York, 2nd dispatch: The well-known American commentator Lippmann recently published an article in the "New Republic" magazine, believing that the United States should negotiate with the Soviet Union, and Western countries should establish a new relationship with Asian and African countries.

Lippmann believes that the United States is currently in a "completely new situation." In politics, "now the capitals of the world are Washington, Moscow, London, Beijing, Delhi, and perhaps finally Cairo," instead of London and Washington being the capitals of the world like after World War I. Britain is now increasingly losing its position as one of the world's major countries, and the United States finds that "in the face of the new powers in Eastern Europe and Asia and Africa, the United States lacks a strong ally."

Secondly, he said, the Soviet Union has broken the United States' atomic monopoly, and the danger of the nuclear arms race is causing neutralism to "begin to spread rapidly" in many countries.

Lippmann believes that there is still a fundamental stalemate between the United States and the Soviet Union. Because there are very serious problems in Europe and the Middle East, these problems may develop out of control and drag the United States and the Soviet Union into a war.

Lippmann said that due to the emergence of new weapons, a major war can no longer be waged. To avoid the danger of a major war, Western countries must hold serious negotiations with the Soviet Union.

Lippmann believes that the issue of war and peace currently depends mainly on whether the European issue can be resolved through negotiations. Lippmann advocates resolving the issue of German reunification and forming a general European security system guaranteed by the Soviet Union and the United States through consultation. He also advocates "the gradual and definite withdrawal of the Red Army and Anglo-American forces from the European continent up to the Soviet border," which he believes will provide the possibility of "liberating" the people's democracies of Eastern Europe.

Lippmann said that, in addition, the United States should strive to establish a "new relationship" between Western countries and the newly liberated nations of Asia and Africa. He said, "The era of imperialism and colonialism is over. The era that follows has only just begun, and our mission is to play a leading role in formulating the conditions that allow the people of the East and the West to live together in an atmosphere of trust, security, and mutual respect."

### 形势比人还强  李普曼主张美苏谈判

    形势比人还强
    李普曼主张美苏谈判
    新华社2日讯  纽约消息：美国著名评论员李普曼最近在“新共和”杂志上发表文章，认为美国应该同苏联谈判，西方国家应该同亚非国家建立一种新的关系。
    李普曼认为，美国目前正在处在一个“全新的形势”下。在政治方面，“现在全世界的首都是华盛顿、莫斯科、伦敦、北京、德里、或许最后还有开罗”，而不是像第一次世界大战后那样全世界的首都是伦敦和华盛顿。英国现在正在日益失去世界主要国家之一的地位，美国发现，“在东欧以及亚洲和非洲新的强国面前，美国缺乏一个强大的盟国。”
    其次，他说，苏联已经打破了美国的原子垄断，核武器竞赛的危险使得中立主义正在许多国家“开始迅速蔓延开来”。
    李普曼认为，目前美苏两国之间仍然存在根本性的僵持局面，由于欧洲和中东都存在十分严重的问题，这些问题可能发展得不可收拾，而把美苏两国拉入一场战争。
    李普曼说，由于新武器的出现，不能再进行大战。要避免发生大战的危险，西方国家就必须同苏联举行认真的谈判。
    李普曼认为，目前战争和和平的问题主要取决于欧洲问题能否通过谈判得到解决。李普曼主张解决德国统一问题，通过协商组成一个得到苏联和美国保证的总的欧洲安全体系。他还主张“红军和英美军队逐渐而肯定地从直到苏联边界为止的欧洲大陆撤出”，他认为这样会提供“解放”东欧人民民主国家的可能。
    李普曼说，另外，美国要努力在西方国家和亚非两洲新解放的民族之间建立一种“新的关系”。他说，“帝国主义和殖民主义的时代已经过去了。跟着到来的时代还只是刚刚开始，我们的使命就是在拟订那种使东西方的人民能够在信任、安全、和互相尊敬气氛中共同生活的条件方面起领导作用。”
