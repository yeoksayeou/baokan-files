Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 30th -- The Soviet Foreign Ministry issued a statement on the Jordan issue, saying that the events in Jordan and the resulting intensification of the situation in the Near and Middle East are a practical manifestation of the "Dulles-Eisenhower Doctrine." This intensification harbors serious dangers. The Soviet Union believes that the Western countries that contributed to the exacerbation of the situation in the Near and Middle East, primarily the United States, must be held responsible for the possible consequences of this situation.

The statement, issued on April 29th, was widely published in today's Moscow newspapers. It stated that in the past two or three weeks, blatant external pressure has been exerted on Jordan and the Jordanian government. At one moment, there were threats of partitioning Jordanian territory and depriving the Jordanian people of their national independence; at another, there were offers of financial and other assistance if the Jordanian authorities suppressed the patriotic forces that opposed Jordan's subservience to foreign orders. At the same time, they made no secret of the fact that after Jordan, the victims of this colonialist action could be Syria and Egypt, because these two countries resolutely oppose the notorious "Dulles-Eisenhower Doctrine" and all attempts to drag them into aggressive military blocs, undermine their national independence, and subordinate their foreign policies to the plans of colonial countries.

The Soviet Foreign Ministry's statement said: The Soviet Union is concerned about the situation in Jordan not because of this or that internal change in Jordan, but because the situation in Jordan and the situation in the entire Near and Middle East, which has recently been formed due to the events in Jordan, are the product of blatant foreign interference and a new imperialist conspiracy that seriously threatens peace. The purpose of this conspiracy is to undermine the unity of the Arab peoples, to make the Arab countries conflict with each other, so as to once again shackle the Arab people with the shackles of colonial oppression and plunder their wealth. It is precisely for these purposes that new and dangerous sources of conflict are being expanded.

The Soviet government believes that the people of the Near and Middle East should be given the opportunity to solve their internal affairs and determine their foreign policies without foreign interference. The Soviet government has proposed that the four major powers, the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, declare that foreign interference in the internal affairs of the Near and Middle Eastern countries is not permitted. On April 19th of this year, the Soviet government again proposed that the four major powers issue a statement condemning the use of force as a means of resolving outstanding issues in the region. It is regrettable that the governments of the three Western countries have not responded to the Soviet proposal.

The Soviet government believes that the United States' dispatch of the Sixth Fleet to the eastern coast of the Mediterranean is an open display of force against the Arab Eastern countries, which has further exacerbated the situation.

The Soviet Foreign Ministry's statement emphasized that although the American aggressive bloc, the culprit of the current events in the Near and Middle East, is trying to sow discord among the Arab countries, the vital interests of the Arab people require them to unite and fight to safeguard their independence and autonomy. This unity once led to the failure of the aggression against Egypt. There is no doubt that the organizers of the current anti-Arab peoples' independence conspiracy that led to the events in Jordan will also suffer the same failure.

    苏联外交部又一次仗义执言
    美国要对约旦局势的后果负责
    应让中近东人民解决自己的问题
    新华社莫斯科30日电  苏联外交部就约旦问题发表声明说，约旦事件和由此而引起的中近东局势的尖锐化是“杜勒斯—艾森豪威尔主义”的实际表现。这种尖锐化包藏着严重的危险。苏联认为，促成中近东局势尖锐化的西方国家，首先是美国要对这种情况的可能后果负责。
    这个在4月29日发表的声明，广泛地刊载在今天莫斯科各报上。它说，最近两三个星期以来，有人对约旦和约旦政府施加了粗暴的外来压力，一会儿是威迫，说要瓜分约旦领土和剥夺约旦人民的民族独立，一会儿又是利诱，说如果约旦当局镇压那些反对约旦服从外国号令的爱国力量，就给约旦以财政帮助和其他帮助。同时，他们并不隐瞒，在约旦之后，这种殖民主义行动的受害者可能是叙利亚和埃及，因为这两个国家都坚决反对臭名远扬的“杜勒斯—艾森豪威尔主义”，反对想把它们拖入侵略性的军事集团、破坏它们的民族独立和使它们的外交政策服从殖民国家的计划的种种企图。
    苏联外交部的声明说：苏联之所以关心约旦局势并不是因为约旦发生这样或者那样的内部变化，而是因为约旦的局势和整个中近东最近由于约旦事件而形成的局势是粗暴的外国干涉的产物，是严重威胁和平的帝国主义新阴谋的产物。这个阴谋的目的是破坏阿拉伯各国人民的团结，使阿拉伯各国互相冲突，以便再次给阿拉伯人民套上殖民压迫的枷锁，掠夺它们的财富。正是为了这些目的，新的危险的冲突策源地被扩大了。
    苏联政府认为，应该让中近东各国人民有机会在没有外来的干涉下自己解决他们的内政问题，确定他们的外交政策。苏联政府曾经建议苏、美、英、法四大国声明不容许外国干涉中近东国家的内政。苏联政府在今年4月19日又建议四大国发表声明，谴责以武力作为解决这个地区的悬而未决的问题的手段。十分遗憾的是，西方三国政府没有答复苏联的建议。
    苏联政府认为，美国把第六舰队开往地中海东岸，是对阿拉伯东方国家公开显示武力，这种做法使局势更加尖锐化。
    苏联外交部的声明强调说，中近东目前的事件的祸首美国侵略集团虽然力图在阿拉伯国家之间散布纠纷，而阿拉伯人民的切身利益却要求他们团结一致，为维护自己的独立自主而斗争。这种团结一致曾经使得侵略埃及的行动遭到失败。毫无疑问，目前导致约旦事件的反阿拉伯各国人民独立的阴谋的组织者也会遭到同样的失败。
