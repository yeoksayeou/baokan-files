Moscow Dispatch from Our Newspaper, May 13th: In collective farms in the Volga River Basin, Ukraine, the North Caucasus, the Urals, and Siberia, tractor work cum field production teams have emerged. This form of agricultural labor organization, which previously only appeared in individual collective farms, is now becoming popular. In many larger collective farms, tractor work teams from tractor stations, which originally served each field production team, are now being replaced by tractor work cum field production teams. Recently, this form of labor organization has also been adopted in collective farms where one tractor work team serves several field production teams. The advantage of the tractor work cum field production team is that it merges the two production units originally managed separately by the tractor station and the collective farm, unifying leadership and resolving conflicts between tractor drivers and collective farm members, thereby benefiting production. This production team is not only concerned about the efficiency of the machines but also about the yield of the crops on the land they cultivate. In the Kaganovich Collective Farm in Novoannensky District of Stalingrad Oblast, the production team led by Gubanov was established before last spring. Because the tractor drivers and farm members worked very well together, the quality of cultivation and the efficiency of the machines were improved, resulting in a one-third increase in grain yield.

    苏联许多集体农庄改变劳动组织
    拖拉机站同生产队合并
    本报莫斯科13日电　在伏尔加河流域、乌克兰、北高加索、乌拉尔、西伯利亚各地集体农庄，出现了拖拉机工作兼田间生产队。这种农业劳动组织的形式，以往只出现在个别集体农庄，现在流行起来。在许多较大的集体农庄，原先每一个田间生产队配有拖拉机站的一个拖拉机工作队，现在代替以拖拉机工作兼田间生产队。最近，在那些由一个拖拉机工作队为几个田间生产队服务的集体农庄，也采用了这种劳动组织形式。拖拉机工作兼田间生产队的长处在于：把原先由拖拉机站与集体农庄分管的两个生产单位合并起来，统一领导，解除拖拉机手和庄员之间的矛盾，因而有利于生产。这种生产队不单关心机器的效能，而且关心所耕作的田地上作物的收成。在斯大林格勒州新安连区有个卡冈诺维奇集体农庄，那里由古巴诺夫带领的这种生产队，是在去年春前建立的。由于拖拉机手和庄员工作非常合拍，耕作的质量和机器的效能都提高了，结果谷物收成增加三分之一。
