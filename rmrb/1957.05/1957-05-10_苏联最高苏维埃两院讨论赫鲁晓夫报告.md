Moscow, May 8 (By Our Staff Correspondent) - The Soviet Union's Supreme Soviet's Council of the Union and Council of Nationalities continued their joint session in the Kremlin today to discuss Comrade Khrushchev's report on further improving the organization of industrial and construction management. The morning session was held from 10:00 AM to 2:00 PM, and the afternoon session from 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM, with delegates enthusiastically delivering speeches. At the morning session, ten delegates spoke. The first speaker was Kozlov, First Secretary of the Leningrad Oblast Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. He discussed the organizational principles of the Leningrad Economic Region, which will include the three oblasts of Leningrad, Pskov, and Novgorod. He disagreed with the establishment of specialized ministries at the republic level, arguing that having both National Economic Councils and specialized ministries at the republic level would result in overlapping institutions. He said that in order to achieve good results from the reform, the National Economic Councils should be consolidated, and outstanding activists free from localism and bureaucracy should be sent there.

Karotchenko, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Ukrainian Republic, said: Ukraine originally wanted to retain industrial ministries for steel, coal mining, construction of coal mining enterprises, metallurgical industry, and chemical industry enterprise construction, etc., but the heads of these ministries and the secretaries of the oblast committees strongly opposed retaining them, and we listened to their opinions. He opposed setting up a Ministry of Timber, Paper, and Wood Processing Industry in the republic. Moscow Oblast delegate Kardanov, Kazakhstan delegate Kunayev, and Sverdlovsk delegate Kirilenko all supported the views of the Leningrad and Ukrainian comrades.

Uzbekistan delegate Kamalov supported retaining the industrial ministries for aviation, shipbuilding, radio, chemical, medium-sized machine building, construction machinery and road construction machinery manufacturing, as well as the Ministry of Defense Industry and the Ministry of General Machine Building, and the merger of the Ministry of Power Stations and the Ministry of Power Station Construction. He proposed moving some scientific research institutions and universities to Uzbekistan, to be led by the National Economic Council. Azerbaijan delegate Mustafayev believed that the Azerbaijan Oil Industry Ministry should be retained, and all oil enterprises should be handed over to the management of the National Economic Council.

At the afternoon session, six delegates spoke. Georgian delegate Chavachavadze proposed setting up geological bureaus in the localities, to be led by the Council of Ministers of the republic and the Soviet Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources Protection. The famous high-speed cutting worker Bykov criticized the Ministry of Machine Tool Manufacturing and Tool Industry for hiding streamlined cadres in factories where they were not needed; one factory had only three vacancies, but the ministry sent twenty-two technicians. Minister of Transport Beshchev proposed that railway transportation of coal, oil, steel, etc., should be centrally managed, while railway transportation of food, building materials, etc., should be managed by the economic regions, so that planning could be done locally. He believed that the establishment of the National Economic Council would help streamline railway management institutions and overcome bureaucracy.

    乌克兰共和国部长会议主席卡罗特钦科说：乌克兰原想保留钢铁、采煤工业、采煤工业企业建设、冶金工业和化学工业企业建筑等工业部，但这些部的负责人和州委书记都坚决反对保留它们，我们听取了他们的意见。他反对在共和国设置木材、造纸和木材加工工业部。莫斯科州代表卡尔达诺夫，哈萨克斯坦代表库纳也夫，斯维尔德洛夫斯克代表基里列诺夫都支持列宁格勒和乌克兰同志的见解。
    乌兹别克斯坦代表卡马洛夫赞成保留航空、造船、无线电、化学、中型机器制造、建筑机器与筑路机器制造等工业部和国防工业部与普通机器制造部，电站部与电站建设部的合并。他提议把一部分科学研究机关和高等学校迁移到乌兹别克斯坦去，由国民经济委员会领导。阿塞拜疆代表穆斯塔德也夫认为，阿塞拜疆的石油工业部应该保留，需把所有石油企业交给国民经济委员会管理。
    在下午会议上有六位代表发言。格鲁吉亚代表查瓦喜什维里提议在地方设置地质局，它受共和国部长会议和苏联地质和矿藏保护部领导。著名高速切削工人贝科夫批评母机制造和工具工业部把精简的干部藏在不需要他们的工厂里，有一个工厂只有三个空额，而部里派去了二十二名技术人员。交通部长别什切夫提议，把煤、石油、钢铁等的铁路运输归中央管理，把食物、建筑材料等的铁路运输归经济区管理，以便能就地计划。他认为，国家经济委员会的建立，将帮助精简铁路管理机构和克服官僚主义。
