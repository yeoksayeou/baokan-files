　　Inejiro Asanuma Delivers Radio Address to the Chinese People
　　Japanese Socialist Party to Launch Movement to Restore Sino-Japanese Diplomatic Relations
　　Japanese Public Opinion Welcomes the Results of the Socialist Party Delegation's Visit to China
　　This newspaper reports that the Japanese Socialist Party is preparing to hold report meetings in various parts of the country from May 8th to launch a movement to promote the normalization of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations. This was stated by Inejiro Asanuma, head of the Japanese Socialist Party's goodwill delegation to China, in a radio address to the Chinese people on the evening of the 7th via Japanese radio.
　　Asanuma first expressed his gratitude to people from all walks of life in China for their friendly reception. He said: Japanese public opinion strongly supports the actions of the Socialist Party's goodwill delegation to China and hopes for the early realization of the normalization of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations; only a part of the conservative party believes that the situation in Taiwan and the status of the United Nations are not as simple as the Socialist Party says.
　　Asanuma then mentioned that after the goodwill delegation to China returned home, all members met with Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi on April 27th and requested the Japanese government and the government of the People's Republic of China to start government-to-government negotiations to restore diplomatic relations as soon as possible. He said: "We also conveyed to the Japanese government the proposal made by the Chinese government that, if the Japanese government is willing, the two governments can sign agreements on meteorology, postal services, fisheries, culture, and trade. We believe that although the Kishi cabinet cannot yet express its attitude on the issue of normalizing diplomatic relations, it would be beneficial to promote the normalization of diplomatic relations to solve the problems that can be solved first. At the same time, the Kishi cabinet has also stated that it will try its best to request the Coordinating Committee for Export Control to relax restrictions on exports to China in order to increase trade volume."
　　Asanuma concluded: "Japanese Socialist Party Chairman Mosaburo Suzuki praised us and said: First, the talks between important Chinese figures and our party's delegation, which reached a consensus on the basic policy for promoting the normalization of diplomatic relations and other current issues, is a great achievement. Second, the joint statement is based on an independent and autonomous position, so friendship and peace will surely be supported by all Asians."
　　This newspaper reports that according to "Japan Press Weekly": The Japanese Socialist Party's goodwill delegation to China returned to Japan on April 26. On the 27th, the delegation reported to the Socialist Party leadership and held talks with the Japanese government, the Liberal Democratic Party, and others. The results of the delegation's visit to China have caused a great response in Japan. On the night of the 27th, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirohide Ishida and delegation leader Inejiro Asanuma spoke on Japanese radio. Ishida said: "No one objects to the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations, but we hope to proceed gradually and deepen the exchanges between the two countries step by step. The Socialist Party's efforts in this regard are commendable."
　　The Japanese government and the Liberal Democratic Party are deeply afraid that the visit of the Socialist Party delegation to China will have a greater impact on people of all classes in Japan, so they are trying to downplay the significance of this visit. The Japanese government stated that it also hopes to restore Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations, but because of the existence of the Japan-Chiang treaty and the fact that the United Nations has not yet recognized China, it is difficult to restore diplomatic relations with China too early. This attitude of the Japanese government immediately aroused dissatisfaction among Japanese public opinion.
　　On April 22, the "Asahi Shimbun" commented on the ambiguous attitude of the Japanese government, saying: "The so-called following the United Nations route is meaningless for Japan, which holds a vote in the United Nations. Isn't the real intention to follow the American route?"
　　An April 24 editorial in the "Hokkaido Shimbun" said: "The joint statement says 'it is hoped that the international tension surrounding Taiwan will be resolved peacefully,' which is in line with the expectations of the Japanese people. 'The representation in the United Nations should belong to the People's Republic of China.' The Japanese government may find it difficult to agree with this, but the Japan-Chiang treaty was obtained through parliamentary approval in a cunning manner after the Yoshida-Dulles letters, and the Japanese people cannot tolerate being tied to this treaty indefinitely."
　　Within the Liberal Democratic Party, the demand for "coming up with a clearer China policy to counter the Socialist Party" is also increasing.

### 浅沼稻次郎向中国人民发表广播演说  日社会党将展开恢复中日邦交运动  日本舆论欢迎社会党使节团访问中国的成果

    浅沼稻次郎向中国人民发表广播演说
    日社会党将展开恢复中日邦交运动
    日本舆论欢迎社会党使节团访问中国的成果
    本报讯　日本社会党准备从5月8日开始在全国各地举行报告大会，展开促进中日邦交正常化运动。这是日本社会党访华亲善使节团团长浅沼稻次郎在7日晚间通过日本电台向中国人民发表的广播演说中说的。
    浅沼首先对中国各界人士给予他们的友好接待表示感谢。他说：日本国民的舆论非常支持社会党的访华亲善使节团的行动，更希望日中邦交的正常化早日实现；只有保守党的一部分人认为，台湾的局势和联合国的现状不像社会党所说的那么简单。
    浅沼接着谈到，访华亲善使节团回国后，全体团员在4月27日会见了日本首相岸信介，要求日本政府和中华人民共和国政府早日开始恢复邦交的政府之间的谈判。他说：“我们还把中国政府提出的——如果日本政府愿意的话，可由两国政府签订气象协定、邮政业务协定、渔业协定、文化协定、贸易协定的提议，传达给了日本政府。我们认为，虽然岸内阁对邦交正常化的问题现在还不能够表示态度，但是把能够解决的问题先来解决，对促进邦交正常化是有利的，同时岸内阁也已经表明，将尽量努力要求巴黎统筹委员会放宽对华禁运限制，以求增加贸易量。”
    浅沼最后说：“日本社会党委员长铃木茂三郎夸奖我们说：首先，由于中国要人和我党使节团的会谈，对于促进邦交正常化的基本方针以及其他目前的各种问题获得了一致意见是很大的成绩。其次，共同声明是根据了自主独立的立场，因此友好和平一定可以得到全亚洲人的支持。”
    本报讯　据“日本新闻周报”报道：日本社会党访华亲善使节团，于4月26日回到日本。27日使节团向社会党领导部门作了报告，并同日本政府、自由民主党等举行了会谈。使节团访问中国所收到的成果，在日本国内引起了很大反响。27日夜，官房长官石田博英和使节团团长浅沼稻次郎在日本广播电台举行广播时谈，石田说：“没有谁对恢复日中邦交持有异议，但希望能顺序渐进，逐步加深两国的交往。社会党所作的努力，在这一点上是值得赞同的。”
    日本政府和自由民主党深恐社会党使节团访问中国一事会在日本各阶层人民中引起更大的影响，所以力图缩小社会党这次访问的意义。日本政府方面表示，它也希望恢复日中邦交，只因有日蒋条约存在，并且联合国还没有承认中国，所以难于过早地同中国恢复邦交。日本政府方面的这种态度，立即引起了日本舆论的不满。
    4月22日“朝日新闻”评论日本政府的暧昧态度时说：“所谓沿着联合国路线，作为在联合国握有一票的日本，这样说是毫无意义的。真实的意图还不就是说要沿着美国路线走么？”
    4月24日“北海道新闻”的社论说：“共同声明说‘希望围绕着台湾的国际紧张局势得到和平解决’，这是符合日本人民的期望的。‘在联合国的代表权应该属于中华人民共和国’，对于这点日本政府也许难于表示赞同吧，但日蒋条约是在吉田、杜勒斯信件之后，以取巧方式取得国会追认的，日本人民不能容忍毫无限期地被钉在这条约上。”
    在自由民主党内部，要求“拿出更明确的对中国的政策，以便与社会党相抗衡”的声浪也在增高。
