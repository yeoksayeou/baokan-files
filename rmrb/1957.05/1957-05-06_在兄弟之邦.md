	In Fraternal Lands
	Moscow Subway Opens New Line
	This year's "May Day," the Moscow subway added a new line - from Crimean Square to the Lenin Stadium. This line includes two new stations - "Frunze" Station and "Sports" Station. On April 30, a celebration was held at Frunze Station to celebrate the opening of the line. Khrushchev spoke at the meeting, congratulating the builders on their new achievements. (The above picture is a sketch of the central hall of the Frunze Subway Station)
	Poland Builds Small Coal Mines
	Poland will begin construction of some new small coal mines this year. These mines will produce 1,200 to 1,500 tons of coal every twenty-four hours, and each mine will have reserves of 3.5 million to 8 million tons. One characteristic of these mines is that their depth is at most only 225 meters, which is half the depth of the large coal mines currently being built. In the next few years, ten to twelve such coal mines will be built.
	The World's First Centrifugal Spinning Machine
	The first centrifugal spinning machine in the world has started operating in a textile factory in Bucharest. This device is the first of its kind in the world. Its characteristic is that it has many revolutions per minute. The production capacity of this spinning machine averages about 40% higher per square meter of working area than other machines.
	Hungary Issues New Medal
	The Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government has created the "For the Defense of the Workers' and Peasants' Power" medal. This medal will be awarded by the government to those who participated in the struggle to suppress counter-revolutionary rebellions and consolidate domestic order.
	Vietnam's Rubber Industry Thrives
	In Hanoi, Haiphong, Nam Dinh and other places in northern Vietnam, there are now more than 150 rubber products factories and workshops, capable of manufacturing more than 200 kinds of rubber products such as bicycle tires, rubber shoes, bladders, and rubber accessories for various machines. These factories employ more than 1,000 workers and produced a total of 4 billion Vietnamese Dong worth of rubber products (equivalent to more than 2.6 million RMB) in 1956. During the rule of the French colonialists, the national rubber industry of Vietnam could not develop due to the monopoly of French and American capital. In the early days of liberation, there were only a few rubber shoe factories in northern Vietnam with dozens of workers.
	Caspian Sea Collective Farm Members Busy Fishing
	Spring, the fishing season in the Soviet Caspian Sea has arrived. The fishing team of the "In Memory of Lenin" collective farm in the Lenkoran district has already caught more than 2,000 quintals of fish. Look, the captain of the farm's fishing team, Kaumar (left), and team member Khankishev have caught another boatload of fish. (See picture below) (Picture attached)

    在兄弟之邦
    莫斯科地下电车辟新线
    今年的“五一”节，莫斯科地下电车又增加了新线路——从克里米亚广场到列宁体育场。这条线路包括两个新车站——“伏龙芝”站和“体育”站。4月30日在伏龙芝车站举行了庆祝通车的大会，赫鲁晓夫在会上讲了话，祝贺建筑者的新成就。（上图是伏龙芝地下电车站中央大厅草图）
    波兰兴建小型煤矿
    波兰今年将开始兴建一些新式的小型煤矿。这些煤矿每二十四小时采煤一千二百吨到一千五百吨，每个煤矿的埋藏量为三百五十万吨到八百万吨。这些煤矿的一个特点是，它们的深度最多只有二百二十五公尺，等于目前建立的大煤井的深度的一半。在今后几年里，将兴建十个至十二个这种煤矿。世界上第一架离心纺纱机
    在布加勒斯特一个纺织厂里，第一部离心纺纱机运转起来了。这种装置在世界上是第一个。它的特点是每分钟有许多转。这种纺纱机平均每平方公尺作业面积的生产能力，大约比其他机器高40％。
    匈牙利颁发新奖章
    匈牙利工农革命政府制好了“拥护工农政权”奖章。这种奖章将由政府授予那些为镇压反革命的叛乱和巩固国内秩序而斗争的参加者。
    越南橡胶业繁荣
    越南北方的河内、海防和南定等地，现在共有一百五十多个橡胶制品工厂和作坊，能够制造自行车轮胎、胶鞋、球胆和各种机器的橡胶附件等二百多种橡胶制品。这些工厂共拥有一千多名工人，1956年共生产了价值越币四十亿元（折合人民币二百六十多万元）的橡胶制成品。在法国殖民者统治时期，由于法国和美国资本的垄断，越南民族橡胶工业不能发展。解放初期，越南北方只有几间拥有几十名工人的胶鞋厂。
    里海农庄庄员捕鱼忙
