Listen Also to the Voices of Editors

    The relationship between the editorial departments of literary publications and writers is as close as fish and water. But there are also contradictions in this relationship, mainly manifested in revisions and rejections. To strengthen their unity, this contradiction must be resolved. If the writer's manuscript is not revised at all, and every manuscript is used, the writer may have no objections. However, this does not mean that the contradiction is resolved. Because not revising a single word and using every manuscript will inevitably affect the quality of the publication, and the editorial department has a more important service object besides serving the writer—that is, the vast number of readers. In fact, the proposition that the editorial department serves the writer is not appropriate enough. It should be said that both writers and editorial departments serve the readers. Clarifying this point is beneficial to resolving the contradiction.
    Regarding the issue of revisions, many editorial departments do indeed disrespect the labor of writers, especially unknown authors, and arbitrarily and presumptuously make mistakes in revising manuscripts. However, it is also a fact that editors have revised more manuscripts by writers, especially young authors, to make them more concise and better. Often, some writers don't mention a single word when the editor has improved their manuscript in ten places, but if they change a single word wrong, they write letters protesting endlessly. No wonder many editors complain: It would be best to have an exhibition of original manuscripts by writers to see how many mistakes were made and how many were corrected? It is the editor's job and responsibility to improve the manuscript, and there is nothing to say. If the manuscript is revised incorrectly, it means that the work has not been done well, and it should also be criticized, and there is nothing to say. However, if the editor makes mistakes in revising some manuscripts, and then proposes "never revise" or "only correct typos and misprints," or even like "the old writer Wang Xiyan said in a firm tone: 'Once one has become a recognized writer, the editor cannot modify his works. I personally advocate that not even a single word can be modified.'" (See the "Minutes of the Symposium of the Eleventh Group of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference" published in Wenhui Daily on the 9th of this month. The emphasis next to the quotation is added by the author of this article.) I think this does more harm than good to the work. Indeed, there are many serious writers whose manuscripts can be left unrevised, but there are also many writers whose manuscripts not only have many "superfluous words, sentences, and paragraphs," but also have many words, sentences, and paragraphs that should be deleted, and there are indeed many errors. In addition, grammatical errors, unclear organization of articles, incorrect or unconvincing individual arguments, and inappropriate wording are also common. If each editorial department really held an exhibition of original manuscripts by writers, not only would people see many major and minor problems on the original manuscripts that were corrected by the editors, but also would be surprised that some errors would come from the pen of "a recognized writer"! The fact that the editor can discover the writer's problems in the manuscript and can revise the writer's manuscript does not necessarily mean that the editor's level is higher than the writer's, but because the editor is the first reader of the manuscript, and the bystander sees clearly; the reason why the writer's manuscript often has these problems is not because the writer's level is low, but because the writer is confused by the situation, or the writing is not serious enough. If every writer could be like Lu Xun: "After finishing writing, read it at least twice, and try to delete superfluous words, sentences, and paragraphs without any regret," then the problem of revisions would be much less. According to the same article in Wenhui Daily quoted above, someone at the symposium proposed: "The editor holds a red pen in his hand, and has the air of giving orders once he has power, and especially likes to modify other people's articles, and is not happy if he doesn't change a single word." This statement is unfair. The editor's revision of the manuscript is not about wielding power or having fun, but about fulfilling his duty and responsibility. Editing work includes revising manuscripts, which is respected as a high-level creation; to put it another way, even if it is not a high-level creation, the editor sometimes spends a lot of effort in his work. Some irresponsible editors are unwilling to revise manuscripts or unwilling to put effort into revising manuscripts. They say that revising manuscripts is like making wedding clothes for others. After the society has indiscriminately criticized editors' revisions, it has found an excuse for those who are unwilling to revise manuscripts; and some people who usually work diligently and conscientiously as editors have also increased a lot of concerns—fearing that they will get no credit for their hard work. If the editors are indiscriminately criticized, it will be unfavorable to the future editing work, and it will also be unfavorable to the unity between the editors and writers, and the contradictions will not be resolved as a result. Regarding the issue of revising manuscripts, I think it is neither a question of "not a single word can be changed" nor a question of "must be changed." I agree with Comrade Liu Baiyu's words: "The question is how to change it. Since the editor and the writer have a common responsibility to the readers (that is, serving the readers together—the author), then if the revision is beneficial to the readers and also beneficial to the author, why can't it be changed?" The editor who says "must be changed" is arrogant; the writer who says "not a single word can be changed" is conceited. Both of these words are not humble and are detrimental to the work. I think that as long as the editorial department improves its work style, is modest and cautious, and tries to ask the author to revise the manuscript himself when revising it, or shows the author the revised manuscript, or at least seeks the author's consent, etc., most writers will not have major objections to the revision.
    If it is said that in resolving the contradiction of revisions, more efforts should be made by the editorial department; then, in resolving the contradiction of rejections, in addition to the same efforts by the editorial department, it is also necessary to obtain the efforts of the other side of the contradiction—the writer's side, that is, understanding of the rejections. A common sense fact that is laid out: the length of each issue of each publication has a certain limit. If the source of manuscripts for this publication is relatively rich, it is impossible to publish every submitted manuscript, and there will inevitably be rejections. If this publication widely solicits manuscripts and widely encourages new and old writers to write for the publication, even the manuscripts solicited will not all be used, and there will inevitably be rejections. Two manuscripts of similar level will always first select the solicited manuscript, and then select the submitted one; first select the manuscript of the old writer, and then select the manuscript of the young writer; first select the manuscript of the young writer, and then select the manuscript of the unknown author (whether this practice is correct is also worth discussing). But if the quality of the two manuscripts differs greatly, then it does not matter whether it is solicited or written by a writer or an old writer. Therefore, even the manuscripts of writers with a certain level are sometimes inevitably rejected. As for the manuscripts of writers that do not even have a certain level, it cannot be said that it is not appropriate to be rejected by the editorial department. However, some writers, when their manuscripts are returned, always put on a displeased face, do not distinguish between right and wrong, and always have opinions on the editorial department, and even have opinions on the editor who specifically handled the manuscript, but rarely consider the quality of their own manuscript, and even less consider the difficulties of the editorial department. There was a writer whose manuscript was submitted to several editorial departments and was rejected. Generally speaking, the quality of this manuscript would not be very good, but this writer did not seek the reason from himself, but complained everywhere. Generally speaking, editorial departments are more cautious in rejecting manuscripts solicited from writers. Sometimes, it is indeed because the quality of the manuscript is too poor that it is rejected as a last resort. The writer's mood is uncomfortable when he receives the rejection, but how can the editor's mood be comfortable when rejecting the manuscript—not only uncomfortable, but simply heavy. If the editor personally returns the manuscript to the writer face to face, that heavy mood, that awkward taste of the rejecter caused by the writer's wounded self-esteem and the lowered face, is truly something that only people who have rejected manuscripts can experience. It is possible for the editor to do more to encourage and promote writers, and to solicit more manuscripts from writers, and this is also the responsibility of the editor. But I hope that writers understand the editor's mood when soliciting manuscripts in this regard. It can be said that from the day of soliciting the manuscript, the solicitor's mood is like a stone being pressed on it. If the manuscript comes, and it is indeed not written well, the editor who solicited the manuscript will unconsciously say heavily in his heart: "Well, I've got another burden!" So, he racked his brains and tried to emphasize the benefits of this manuscript in front of the editor-in-chief, even using the reasons of uniting writers, etc., as an excuse to firmly request publication. If the manuscript finally does not pass, he will call everywhere to transfer the manuscript to other editorial departments. If an editorial department says that the manuscript can be considered for use, and the writer also agrees, he will jump up and say: "Well, I've dropped a burden!" At this time, his happy mood is no less than hearing that his own manuscript has been adopted. Why does the editor feel so heavy about soliciting manuscripts? This cannot but be attributed to the attitude and accusations of writers towards rejections on weekdays. I have said so much tediously, just for one purpose: If writers can also understand the difficulties and pain of the editorial department and the editor, his opinions on the editorial department may be less, the estrangement may be less, and this contradiction will be resolved under mutual respect and understanding.
    Since the proposal of professionalizing writers, and some writers have begun to be professionalized, the contradiction of rejections has had a new situation, and it can be said that this contradiction is more acute. After the professionalization of writers, the output of manuscripts has increased, especially the output of short manuscripts has increased, and it is more convenient for editorial departments to solicit manuscripts, which is a good phenomenon. However, with more output, no matter which writer, it cannot be guaranteed that the quality of every manuscript is good (not to mention those writers who write sloppily and produce crudely). However, as far as I know, some writers now, even if they themselves know that the quality of the manuscript is not high, still take it out to the editorial department, but they do not use their real names. This is clearly giving the editorial department a hard time. To be honest, sometimes the quality of the writer's manuscript is not high, but it is still used, for the sake of the famous writer's manuscript. It can not only achieve the purpose of "uniting writers," but also "bear the responsibility for the content"; if even the writer himself is unwilling to use his real name, then it makes the editorial department even more difficult. Some editorial departments now pay a certain amount of remuneration for specially commissioned manuscripts when they are not used, which is appropriate. I think all editorial departments can adopt this method. However, to truly resolve the contradiction of rejections, in addition to the editors respecting the writers' labor more and not making the mistake of rude and unreasonable rejections, the more important thing is the writers' understanding of the difficulties and pain of the editorial department.
    As long as there is mutual respect and mutual understanding, this contradiction between the editorial department and the writer can be resolved; the unity between the editorial department and the writer will be strengthened. And mutual respect and mutual understanding also have a basis, that is, the labor purpose of writers and editors is to serve the readers.

    也请听听编辑的声音

    文艺刊物编辑部跟作家的关系，是像鱼跟水一样密切的。但这当中也有矛盾：主要表现在改稿和退稿上。想加强他们之间的团结，必须解决这个矛盾，如果对作家的稿子一字不改、每稿必用，在作家方面，也许没有意见了；可是，这并不等于解决了矛盾。因为一字不改、每稿必用，这必然会影响刊物的质量，而编辑部除了为作家服务外，还有一个更主要的服务对象——那就是广大的读者。其实，说编辑部是为作家服务的这个提法，就不够恰当。应该说作家和编辑部都是为读者服务的。明确这点，对解决矛盾是有好处的。
    关于改稿问题，许多编辑部都的确有对作家、尤其是无名作者的劳动不够尊重，粗暴地、自以为是地改错了稿子的事实。但是，编辑把作家、尤其是青年作者的更多的稿子修改得更精练、更好了，这也是一个事实。往往有些作家，编辑把他的稿子改好了十个地方他一字不提，要是改错了一个字，就来信抗议不休。难怪很多编辑发牢骚说：最好是来个作家原稿展览会，看到底改错了多少，改对了多少？编辑把稿子改好了，这是编辑应做的工作，应尽的责任，原没有甚么好说；把稿子改错了，是没有把工作做好，也应该受到批评，这也没有甚么好说。不过，要是由于编辑改错了一些稿子，就提出“决不改动”或“只改笔误、别字”，甚至像“老作家王西彦用斩钉截铁的口气说：‘既已成为公认的作家，编辑就不能修改他的作品。我个人主张，连一个字也不能修改。’”（见本月九日文汇报所载“上海市政协第十一小组座谈纪要”。引文旁的加重点是本文作者加的）我看这对工作还是害多利少。的确有很多写作严肃的作家，他的稿子是可以一字不改的，但也确有不少作家的稿子，不但有许多“可有可无的字、句、段”，而且确实有许多应该删去的字、句、段，和确实有许多错误的地方。此外如文法不通、文章的组织条理不清、个别的论点不正确或说服力不强、有些提法不恰当，等等，也是常见的事。如果各编辑部真的举行一个作家原稿展览会，不但会看到不少给编辑改正的、原稿上的大大小小的毛病，而且还会使人惊讶有些错误竟会出自“已成为公认的作家”之笔！编辑能发现作家稿子的毛病，能改作家的稿子，并不一定是由于编辑比作家的水平高，而是因为编辑是稿子的第一个读者，旁观者清；作家的稿子所以往往有这些毛病，也并不是由于作家的水平低，而是由于作家当局者迷，或写作还不够严肃。假如每一个作家都能像鲁迅那样：“写完后至少看两遍，竭力将可有可无的字、句、段删去，毫不可惜。”那么，改稿的问题就会少得多了。据上面所引的文汇报同日同文的刊载，在座谈会上还有人提出：“编辑手里握了一枝红笔，大有一朝权在手，就把令来行的气概，特别喜爱修改别人的文章，不改一个字总不过瘾。”这种说法是不公正的。编辑改稿子不是甚么弄权、过瘾，而是在尽他的职和责。编辑工作包括改稿被尊重为高级的创作；退一步说，即使不是高级的创作，编辑在工作中所花的心血有时也是很多的。有些对工作不负责任的编辑是不愿意改稿或不愿意用心血改稿的，他们说，改稿是为他人作嫁衣裳。目前社会上对编辑改稿不分青红皂白提出了批评后，更为这种不愿意改稿的人找到了借口；而一些平日勤勤恳恳用心做编辑工作的人也增加了不少顾虑——怕的是卖力不讨好。如果不分是非地指责编辑，对今后的编辑工作是不利的，对编辑与作家的团结也是不利的，矛盾也并不会因此而解决的。关于改稿子的问题，我看既不是“一个字也不能改”，也不是“非改不可”的问题，我同意刘白羽同志的话：“问题是怎样改。既然编辑与作家对读者负有共同责任（即同为读者服务——作者），那末，改，如果对读者有利，对作者也有利，为什么不能改呢？”说“非改不可”的编辑，是狂妄的；说“一个字也不能改”的作家，是自大的。两者的话都是不谦逊、都是对工作不利的。我想，只要编辑部改进工作作风，虚心、慎重，改稿时尽可能提意见请作者自己改，或改好后给作者看过，或至少征求作者的同意，等等，一般作家对改稿是不会有很大意见的。
    如果说在解决改稿这个矛盾上，由编辑部这一面多作努力就行了；那末，在解决退稿这个矛盾上，除了同样地要由编辑部这一面多作努力外，还必须得到矛盾的另一面——作家的那一面的努力，那就是对退稿的谅解。一个摆出来的常识的事实：每一个刊物每一期的篇幅都有一定的限量，假如这个刊物的稿源比较丰富，就不可能每篇来稿都刊用，必然有退稿。如果这个刊物广泛约稿，广泛鼓励新、老作家为刊物写稿，就是约来的稿子，也不可能每篇都用，也必然有退稿。两篇水平差不多的稿子，总是先选约来的稿，后选投来的；先选老作家的稿，后选青年作家的；先选青年作家的稿，后选无名作者的（这种作法是否正确，也还值得商讨）。但是如果两篇稿子的质量相差较大，那就顾不了是约来的、或是作家的，或是老作家的了。因此，即使是作家的有一定水平的稿子，有时也还是免不了要退掉的。至于作家的那些连一定水平都没有的稿子，被编辑部退回去，那就不能不说是应该的了。可是有些作家，遇到稿子给退回来，就总绷着脸不高兴，不分黑白，总对编辑部有意见，甚至对具体处理那个稿件的编辑有意见，却很少考虑自家的稿子的质量怎样，更少考虑到编辑部的困难。有一个作家，他的一篇稿子投到几个编辑部，都被退回去了，一般来说，这篇稿子的质量不会是很好的，可是这位作家却不反求诸己，而到处提意见。一般编辑部退约来的作家的稿，还是比较慎重的。有的时候，的确是由于稿子的质量太差，万不得已才退的。作家收到退稿时的心情不舒服，其实编辑在退稿时的心情又何尝舒服——岂但不舒服，简直是沉重的。如果是编辑亲自向作家当面退稿，那种沉重的心情，那种由于作家的自尊心受到了损伤所放下的脸孔而引起的退稿人的别扭味儿，真是没有给人退过稿的人所能体会的。编辑对作家多做鼓舞、催生的工作，多约作家写稿，是可以的，这也是做编辑的责任。可是希望作家在这方面了解一下编辑的约稿心情。可以说自从约稿的那天起，约稿人的心情就像压上了一块石头。如果稿子来了，果然写得不好，约稿的那个编辑，会不自觉地在心里沉重地说：“唔，又背上了个包袱！”于是，他就挖空心思、想尽理由在主编面前强调这篇稿的好处，甚至以团结作家等理由为借口，坚决请求刊用。要是稿子终于通不过，他便到处打电话把稿子转给别的编辑部，如果有个编辑部说稿子可以考虑用，而作家也同意，他会跳起来说：“唔，丢掉了个包袱！”这时，他的高兴的心情，并不减于听到了自己的稿子被采用的。为什么编辑对约稿会感到那么沉重呢？这就不能不归究到作家平日对待退稿的态度和责难了。我啰啰嗦嗦地说了这么一大堆，无非是为了一个目的：要是作家也能体会到编辑部和编辑的困难和苦衷，他对编辑部的意见也许会少些，隔阂也许会少些，这个矛盾就会在互相尊重、谅解之下解决了。
    自从提出了作家职业化，有些作家开始职业化以后，退稿的矛盾，又有了新的情况，也可以说，这个矛盾更尖锐了。作家职业化以后，稿子的产量增多了，特别是短稿子的产量增多了，编辑部约稿比较方便了，这是一个好现象。可是产量多了，不管是哪一个作家，也不能保证每一篇稿子的质量都是好的（要是写作不严肃的粗制滥造的作家就更不用说了）。然而，据我所知道，现在有些作家，即使连自己也知道稿子的质量不高，可是也仍旧拿出来给编辑部，只是不用真名。这明明是给编辑部苦头吃。说句老实话，有时作家的稿子质量虽然不高，也还是用了，为的是名作家的稿子。既可以达到“团结作家”的目的，还可以“文责自负”；要是连作家自己也不愿用真名那就更使编辑部为难了。现在有些编辑部对特约的稿子不用时，付以一定的稿费，这是应该的。我以为所有编辑部都可以采用这办法。然而要真正解决退稿的矛盾，除了编辑多尊重作家的劳动，不犯粗暴、无理退稿的错误外，更主要的，是作家对编辑部的困难和苦衷的谅解。
    只要互相尊重，互相谅解，编辑部和作家之间的这个矛盾，是可以解决的；编辑部和作家的团结是会加强的。而互相尊重和互相谅解也是有基础的，那就是作家和编辑的劳动目的都是为读者服务。
