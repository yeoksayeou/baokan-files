Xinhua News Agency, May 30th, Manila Dispatch: Senator Claro Recto has demanded an immediate resolution of the disputes surrounding US military bases in the Philippines. He stated that if the fundamental issue of jurisdiction over American military personnel is not resolved, anti-American incidents like the one in Taipei could also occur in Japan or the Philippines.

The Philippine government broke off negotiations with the United States last December regarding military bases over the issue of jurisdiction.

According to sources within the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs, the Philippine government will demand that the United States promptly resume the stalled negotiations on military bases. The source said that the Taipei incident has led to a widespread belief in the Philippines that US-Philippine negotiations should resume and reach a satisfactory agreement.

Government officials stated that if the United States refuses to resume subcommittee negotiations on the base issue, the Philippines will seek ambassador-level talks. The newly appointed US Ambassador to the Philippines, Bohlen, is scheduled to arrive in Manila on June 1st.

Government officials stated that there will be no change in the Philippines' insistence on having the right to try American soldiers. They said that the Philippines still requires Washington to relinquish the right to try American soldiers for certain crimes they commit.

    台北事件引起连锁反应
    菲律宾将要求恢复美菲谈判
    雷克托主张解决对美军审判权问题
    新华社30日讯　马尼拉消息：参议员克拉罗·雷克托要求立即解决美国在菲律宾的军事基地的争执。他说，如果不解决对美国军事人员的审判权的根本问题，像台北发生的那样的反美事件也可能在日本或者菲律宾发生。
    菲律宾政府在去年12月同美国进行关于军事基地的谈判时曾经在审判权的问题上宣告破裂。
    据菲律宾外交部方面消息，菲律宾政府将要求美国迅速恢复陷于僵局的关于军事基地的谈判。消息说，台北事件使菲律宾普遍认为美菲谈判应该恢复并且达成令人满意的协议。
    政府人士说，如果美国拒绝恢复关于基地问题的小组谈判，菲律宾将寻求大使级的谈判。美国新任驻菲律宾大使波伦预定在6月1日到达马尼拉。
    政府人士说，菲律宾在坚持要求有审判美国兵的权利方面将没有任何改变。他们说，菲律宾仍然要求华盛顿放弃审判美国兵犯的某些罪的权利。
