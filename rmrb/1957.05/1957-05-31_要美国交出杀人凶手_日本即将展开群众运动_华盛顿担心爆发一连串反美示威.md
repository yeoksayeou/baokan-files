Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 30th: Representatives from the Japanese Socialist Party, Communist Party, labor unions, and farmer groups held a joint meeting on the 28th in Somagahara, Gunma Prefecture, deciding to launch a mass movement starting in June to demand that the American soldier Jerard, who shot and killed a Japanese woman in Somagahara, be handed over to Japan for trial.

Japanese newspapers in the past two days have continued to condemn American actions by linking them to the anti-American incidents in Taipei. The English-language "Japan Times" believes Jerard should be tried by Japan. It said that if Japanese courts have no jurisdiction over American soldiers, then the fierce anti-American demonstrations in Taipei may be a manifestation of events happening in Japan.

An "Asahi Shimbun" commentator, commenting on the attempts by American military authorities and newspapers to exonerate Jerard on the grounds that he committed the crime while "on duty," said: "From this, it can be seen that killing is the duty of American soldiers."

The "Asahi Shimbun" commentator also commented on the anti-American incidents in Taipei, saying: The Taiwan demonstrations are an eruption of the resentment that has long been suppressed in the hearts of the Taiwanese people.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 29th: Japanese prosecutors yesterday demanded a two-year prison sentence and a fine of 50,000 yen for American businessman and former U.S. Army criminal investigator Shatak, who was accused of receiving stolen goods.

Prosecutors accused Shatak of receiving four gemstones stolen from the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo by another American, McFarland. McFarland has already been sentenced to eight years in prison for the crime of stealing gemstones. Before being convicted, McFarland confessed that Shatak was involved in the theft.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 30th: A Washington dispatch published in the "Hindustan Times" on May 29th indicates that Washington officials are generally worried about the outbreak of more anti-American demonstrations like those in Taiwan.

The dispatch said that some people in Washington, responding to the resounding foreign calls of "Yankee Go Home," are calling for "Americans to come back." The United States is deeply concerned about losing prestige, and the House Foreign Affairs Committee has already convened experts on Far Eastern affairs from the State Department and the Department of Defense on the 28th to begin research.

The dispatch said, "Alarm bells are ringing everywhere." The U.S. Embassy in the Philippines has taken special precautions to prevent demonstrations there. The dispatch also said that new demonstrations are expected to break out in Japan over the Jerard case.

The dispatch also said that, according to materials from the U.S. Department of Defense, there were a total of 14,394 cases of crimes allegedly committed by American soldiers stationed in various foreign countries last year.

    要美国交出杀人凶手
    日本即将展开群众运动
    华盛顿担心爆发一连串反美示威
    据新华社30日讯　东京消息：日本社会党、共产党、工会、农民团体的代表28日在群马县相马原举行联席会议，决定从6月份开始展开一个群众运动，要求把在相马原枪杀日本妇女的凶手美国兵哲腊德交给日本审判。
    日本报纸这两天在继续联系着台北的反美事件谴责美国的行动。英文“日本时报”认为哲腊德应由日本审判。它说，如果日本的法庭对美国军人没有审判权，那末在台北发生的激烈的反美示威可能是在日本发生的事件的一种表现。
      “朝日新闻”的评论员在评论美国军事当局和报纸企图以哲腊德是在“值勤”时犯了罪行为理由来开脱他的时候说：“由此可见，杀人是美国军人的职责”。
      “朝日新闻”评论员还评论台北反美事件说：台湾示威是台湾人民长久积压在内心的愤恨的爆发。
    据新华社29日讯　东京消息：日本检察当局昨天要求对被控接受赃物的美国商人、前美军刑事侦查员沙塔克判处两年徒刑和罚款五万日元。
    检察当局控告沙塔克接受另一个美国人麦克法兰从东京帝国饭店里偷来的四块宝石。麦克法兰已经因为犯有偷窃宝石罪被判处徒刑八年。麦克法兰在定罪以前供认沙塔克同这个偷窃案有关。
    据新华社新德里30日讯　“印度斯坦时代晚报”5月29日登载的华盛顿消息表明，华盛顿人士普遍担心会爆发更多的像台湾那样的反美示威。
    消息说，华盛顿有人响应了外国响彻云霄的“美国佬滚回去”的呼声而要求“美国人回来”。美国深深担心它会失去威望，众议院外交委员会在28日已经召集国务院和国防部远东问题专家开始进行研究。
    消息说，“到处都响起了警钟”。美国驻菲律宾大使馆已经采取了特别预防措施以防那里发生示威。消息还说，预料日本还会因为哲腊德案件而爆发新的示威。
    消息还说，据美国国防部的材料，去年，驻在各个外国的美国军人被控犯罪案共达一万四千三百九十四件。
