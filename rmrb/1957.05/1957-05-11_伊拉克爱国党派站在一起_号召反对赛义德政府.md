    Calling for Opposition to the Said Government
    Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, May 10th (Tass): According to newspaper reports, political parties and organizations within Iraq opposed to the policies of the Nuri al-Said government and the Baghdad Pact have formed a Supreme National Committee.
    The committee issued a letter to the Iraqi people, calling for strengthening the struggle against the Nuri al-Said government, while putting forward the following demands: the resignation of the Nuri al-Said government, the dissolution of the current parliament; withdrawal from the Baghdad Pact; opposition to all imperialist interference; implementation of an independent policy based on the principles of active neutrality; granting the people democratic freedoms; and the release of political prisoners.
    The letter to the people also strongly criticized the "Eisenhower Doctrine," considering it a "new form of imperialist enslavement."
    Xinhua News Agency, Habbaniyah, May 10th: Britain handed over five Mark 4 jet fighters to Iraq on May 8th. The donation ceremony was held at a former British air force base on the banks of the Euphrates River, and Iraqi Prime Minister Said represented the Iraqi government in accepting the aircraft.
