Special Dispatch by Our Newspaper and Xinhua News Agency: The Ministry of Culture invited library experts to a symposium on the 20th and 24th. The experts raised many criticisms and suggestions regarding the Ministry of Culture's leadership.

The symposium focused on criticisms of the Ministry of Culture's lack of attention to library leadership. Gu Jiajie, Director of the Library Department of the Academy of Sciences, said that the Ministry of Culture's policy and tasks for public libraries have been wavering in recent years. Before the call to advance towards science, the libraries were designated to serve the general public, with students and Young Pioneers as the main readers. Even the Beijing Library set up reading rooms for children and developed reading activities for them, while scientists were not given enough attention. In terms of collections, thread-bound books and pre-liberation paperbacks were basically not lent out, as they were considered to contain "toxins." Foreign language books from Europe and America, except for the Beijing Library, were rarely purchased by other libraries. After the call to advance towards science, conflicts arose between serving the masses and serving scientific workers, and it was not until the National Library Work Conference last year that the policy and tasks of public libraries became relatively clear. Zhang Shenfu, a researcher at the Beijing Library, used the Beijing Library as an example to illustrate that due to the leadership's neglect of library work, the development direction of the country's largest library has been unclear for a long time, its nature has not been determined, and the library's regulations have not yet been promulgated. Wang Chongmin, Director of the Library Science Department of Peking University, also mentioned that the Ministry of Culture focuses on film, drama, and literary creation, but greatly neglects library work. For example, regarding library science education, the Ministry of Culture reduced support step by step from 1952 to 1956, only caring about cadres and not the development and scientific research of the department. We fought step by step, wanting to extend the study period and improve teaching quality.

During the symposium, experts also talked about the common problems in current library work, such as insufficient books and a shortage of cadres, which hinder the development of library work. Zhao Wanli, a researcher at the Beijing Library, said that the "Zhao Cheng Canon" is the only precious canon in the country, which is of great help to the study of Buddhism, philosophy, and history. Currently, only one person is repairing this book. If ten volumes are repaired each month, it will take more than thirty years to complete the repair of the entire book. He hopes to increase the number of repair workers. He also talked about the binding of rare books. The Beijing Library has more than 60,000 books to be bound, including 20,000 damaged ones. With the current five binders, it will take a hundred years to complete the binding. Experts such as Zhang Tianlin mentioned that many old, weak, and neurasthenia patients have been assigned to work in libraries. Some libraries seem to be "nursing homes" or "hospitals," which seriously affects the work of the libraries.

The experts also put forward many suggestions at the symposium, hoping that relevant departments would solve problems such as the cooperation and coordination between major libraries, the training of library cadres, and the utilization of books.

    图书馆专家举行座谈
    批评文化部不重视图书馆工作
    本报新华社特约专稿　文化部在20、24两日邀请图书馆专家座谈。专家们对文化部的领导工作提出许多批评和建议。
    在座谈中集中批评了文化部对图书馆领导的不重视。科学院图书馆部主任顾家杰说，文化部几年来对公共图书馆的方针任务是摇摆不定的。在提倡向科学进军之前，确定图书馆为广大群众服务，读者主要是学生、少先队员，连北京图书馆都办起少年儿童阅览室，展开少年儿童阅览工作，反而对科学家照顾的太少。在藏书方面线装书和解放前平装本基本上不出借，认为有毒素。欧美的外文图书，除去北京图书馆外，其他图书馆很少买。提倡向科学进军后，各图书馆就发生为群众服务与为科学工作者服务之间的矛盾，直到去年全国图书馆工作会议后，公共图书馆的方针任务才比较明确了。北京图书馆研究员张申府以北京图书馆为例，说明由于领导不重视图书馆工作，长期使全国最大的北京图书馆的发展方向不明确，性质未确定，至今未颁布图书馆的规程。北京大学图书馆学系主任王重民也谈到文化部把重点放在电影、戏剧、文艺创作等方面，却对图书馆事业非常轻视。如图书馆学教育问题，文化部从1952年到1956年是一步一步压，只管要干部，不管学系的发展和科学研究，我们是一步一步的争，想延长修业期限，提高教学质量。
    专家们在座谈中还谈到目前图书馆工作中比较普遍存在着图书不足、干部缺少，阻碍了图书馆事业发展。北京图书馆研究员赵万里说，“赵城经藏”是国内唯一的珍本经藏，对佛教、哲学、历史研究有很大的帮助。现只有一个人修补这部书，如每月整修以十卷计，全书修完要用三十多年。他希望增加修补工人。他还谈到善本书装订问题。北京图书馆要装订的六万多册书，其中残坏者二万册，现有五个人装订，如此下去要一百年才能装订完。张天麟等专家们谈到许多老弱、神经衰弱等病患者都分配到图书馆工作。有些图书馆好像是“养老院”、“养病院”，严重地影响了图书馆的工作。
    专家们在座谈会上还提出许多建议，希望有关部门解决各大图书馆相互配合协调、培养图书馆干部和发挥书籍的作用等问题。
