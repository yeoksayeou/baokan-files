    Letters to the Editor
    The statement in your newspaper's 16th publication of "Representatives of Industry and Commerce Expose Public-Private Contradictions Within Joint Ventures" regarding my speech, "They fear that when a movement comes, they will be labeled as class alien elements," differs from what I originally said. I said: "They fear being associated with their class nature, fearing that in a future movement, they will be used as typical examples and bases for criticism." I clarified that this concern was held by "some industrialists and businessmen," not all. Therefore, the subheading "Jiangsu Industrialists and Businessmen Fear Being Labeled as Class Alien Elements After ‘Speaking Out’" is inappropriate. Please correct this.

    你报16日发表的“工商界代表揭发合营企业内部公私矛盾”关于我的发言“怕一旦有运动来时会把他们说成阶级异己分子”这句话，与我原来讲的有出入。我是这样说的：“他们怕与阶级本质联系起来，怕以后另一个运动来时，作为批判的典型，批判的根据。”这种思想顾虑我说明是“有些工商界”而不是全体工商界。因此小标题“江苏工商界怕‘鸣’以后，被说是阶级异己分子”这是不恰当的。请更正。    　　　谢惟安
