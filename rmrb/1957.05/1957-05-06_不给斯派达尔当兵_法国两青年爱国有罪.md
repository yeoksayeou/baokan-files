Xinhua News Agency, May 5th, Moscow Dispatch from TASS, Paris, May 4th: French constables arrested and imprisoned Lyon student Guillaumae, because he refused to serve in the army under the command of former Hitler General Speidel.

Guillaumae's father was a resistance fighter who was shot by the Gestapo during the war. Before being arrested, Guillaumae wrote a letter to the French President, in which he said: "If I agree to serve in the army under the command of a commander who is directly responsible for the killing of millions of French resistance fighters, it would be an insult to my father as the son of someone who was shot."

Another French youth, Marti, was also arrested and imprisoned for the same reason.

    不给斯派达尔当兵
    法国两青年爱国有罪
    新华社5日讯　据塔斯社巴黎4日讯：法国宪兵逮捕和监禁了里昂学生纪耶尔麦，因为他拒绝在前希特勒将领斯派达尔统率下的军队中服兵役。
    纪耶尔麦的父亲是一个在战争时期被盖世太保枪杀的抵抗运动战士。纪耶尔麦在被捕前给法国总统写了一封信，他说：“如果我同意在对杀害千百万法国抵抗运动战士负有直接责任的司令官指挥下的军队中服役，对于作为一个被枪杀者的儿子来说，就是侮辱了自己的父亲。”
    另一个法国青年马尔蒂也因为同样的原因而被捕入狱。
