Nanjing, This newspaper reports: Ten professors of political science, sociology, and law in Nanjing have expressed sharp criticisms of the subjectivist errors in abolishing the Law School of Nanjing University during the restructuring of departments and faculties, and demanded that the state value and fully utilize talents in political science, law, and sociology. This meeting was convened on the afternoon of May 16th by the Nanjing Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League.

Gao Yihan said: Nanjing has a large number of people engaged in legal work, and many of them have now changed careers, and many others have no job positions.

Gao Yihan: (Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Justice, former Dean of the Law School of Peking University)
Some say that Nanjing University emphasizes science and neglects liberal arts, but in fact, sociology and law are even more neglected. Marxist-Leninist philosophy is the guiding principle of all sciences, but it cannot replace sociology and law; government policies and guidelines cannot replace the law either. Nanjing has a large number of people engaged in legal work, and many of them have now changed careers, and many others have no job positions. Does this mean that those engaged in the old law cannot engage in the new law? However, some leading comrades in Beijing's judicial work also studied the old law. Is it possible that those in Nanjing with old legal views cannot be transformed?

To consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, it is necessary to strengthen the legal system, but who will formulate the law? Now, when hearing cases, there are no legal provisions. Sometimes, the verdict is wrong, and sometimes it is impossible to adjudicate the case.

I remember that when the departments and faculties were adjusted in 1952, the Law School of Nanjing University was abolished. The leadership said: The abolition is the national policy and must be done. I did not agree with this statement, and they wanted me to make a self-criticism, but I still could not see the logic.

Sun Xucun said: Marxism-Leninism is the foundation of all sciences, but it cannot replace sociology, political science, and law.

Sun Xucun: (Deputy Director of the Nanjing Municipal Bureau of Justice, former Professor of International Law at Nanjing University)
Are politics, society, and law science or a panacea? Can Marxism-Leninism represent everything? This question must be resolved first. Some people say these are sciences, but we want socialist science, and yours is a set of capitalist ideas that must be eradicated from the roots. In fact, Marxism-Leninism did not fall from the sky. Socialist science and capitalist science are connected.

The merits of a policy should be judged by its practical effects. In recent years, the effects of this career change policy have been obvious. The research work in law has regressed. If we were placed in our original positions, I think we would be better than hitting east with one hammer and west with another.

What is the reason?

First, the leading comrades are unclear about professional ideas and scientific viewpoints, as if Marxism-Leninism can represent everything. Marxism-Leninism is the foundation of all sciences, but it cannot replace sociology, political science, and law.

Second, there is sectarianism and complacency. Some comrades in the leadership believe that although they do not understand natural science, they understand social science, because social science is class struggle. After so many years of revolution, don't we understand social science? This is an oversimplification. They are complacent about people and do not sincerely help people. We have shortcomings, but we can be transformed; however, the leadership seems to dislike us like a doctor who dislikes a seriously ill patient and sends him to the morgue.

Zhu Yue'an said: People engaged in sociology can still be transformed and contribute to the country.

Zhu Yue'an: (Counselor of the Jiangsu Provincial People's Committee, former Professor of Sociology at Nanjing University)
Today's meeting is the first breath of spring.

The Ministry of Higher Education and Nanjing University kicked the Law School away. Not long ago, the responsible party comrade of Nanjing University said at a meeting: It was wrong to abolish the Law School. He only said one sentence. In fact, the abolition of the Law School has caused great losses to the country and the people.

I believe that even if the sociology department is said to be reactionary, people engaged in sociology can still be transformed to contribute to the country.

Are people who study sociology all uneducated? I don't think so. For example, bourgeois population theory serves the bourgeoisie, but if we can make good use of it today, we can serve the working class to improve their lives. Other issues such as family issues, religious issues, and ethnic issues all belong to sociology. Some people mechanically quote that the Soviet Union does not have sociology, so China should not have sociology either; in fact, the Soviet Union also has it, but it is placed in ethnology.

With twelve years as a deadline, to march towards science in a big way, we old, weak, and disabled soldiers can still play a role. At least in the struggle against imperialist reactionary theories, we can still play a role in verbal battles, because our teachers are scholars from capitalist countries, and we understand their "bagua formation" in our hearts. We also know the languages of various countries. As long as the leadership arms us with Marxism-Leninism, we are willing to charge into battle in the struggle against the enemy.

Wang Huiming said: We are all over fifty years old, and our age does not allow us to wait.

Wang Huiming: (Professor of Art at Nanjing Normal College, former Professor of Political Science at Nanjing University)
The government's treatment of law school professors and ordinary intellectuals is different. First, after liberation, there have been great changes in colleges and universities, but no one who studied Chinese language was asked to teach chemistry, while those of us who studied sociology, law, and political science were sent to the library, the Counselor's Office, teaching art, or teaching Russian. Second, the path of transforming intellectuals is through their own profession. But why don't people studying politics and law have this path to transform themselves? Don't you believe us, or don't you believe in yourselves? Third, today, domestic education is in an extremely unbalanced state. History has blossomed in five flowers, while law has only one. In fact, when teaching, the truth cannot be explained without the contrast between the old and new laws.

Our problem has been dragging on for five years, and I hope it can be resolved in the next academic year. We are all over fifty years old, and our age does not allow us to wait.

Chen Yifu said: The party committee leaders of Nanjing University and relevant cultural and educational departments have made three mistakes.

Chen Yifu: (Counselor of the Provincial People's Committee, former Professor of Jinling University)
Social sciences should be developed. However, sociology, political science, and law in Nanjing have suffered unreasonable neglect and heavy blows. Why is this? I believe that the party committee leaders of Nanjing University and relevant cultural and educational departments have made three major mistakes:

First, the leaders have a low level of culture. After liberation, I lived in Nanjing University for two years. A leading comrade gave us lectures on philosophy. I asked this leading comrade what Hegel's "absolute idea" was. The leader pretended to understand, saying it was "bullshit."

Second, the cultural and educational leadership departments did not understand the central government's policies or even deliberately violated them.

Third, they have poor moral character, and their sense of privilege and superiority has reached a crazy degree. Individual party leaders at Nanjing University regarded themselves as classic authors of Marxism. At that time, there was a young teaching assistant in the Law School, because he was a member of the Communist Youth League, the leadership wanted everyone to follow his lead. People with poor knowledge will suppress criticism and fear criticism. The leadership of Nanjing University is always considering retaliation and suppression against people with different opinions.

Treating intellectuals as landlords and bullies is the style of Qin Shihuang's burning of books and burying scholars.

We have shortcomings, and also some good aspects. We are not as bad as the cultural and educational leaders in Nanjing imagine. If there were only these leaders in Nanjing, at least I would have been killed long ago.

It is recommended that the central government consider strengthening leadership in the cultural and educational fields.

Wu Xueyi said: I am engaged in law, and I urgently request to return to my team.

Wu Xueyi: (Library of the East China Pharmaceutical Institute, former Professor of Law at Nanjing University)
I am engaged in law, but now I work in the library. This is improper use and inappropriate arrangement. I can neither engage in teaching nor engage in legal research. I urgently request to return to my team. Therefore, I specifically suggest restoring the Law School of Nanjing University, or establishing a law research institute in Nanjing to gather the old law professors.

Is it objectively needed? I think it is very needed. Eight years have passed since the founding of the People's Republic, but the legal system is still not sound, and everyone is just acting according to policies and guidelines. In fact, which country in the world does not have laws? Without laws, work is greatly affected. In fact, it has been difficult to legislate in recent years, but the leadership is unwilling to use those of us who understand a little law.

I am now working under the government's arrangement, essentially being given a bowl of rice to eat. I eat but do no work. Even my child says I am a good-for-nothing, but I definitely do not want to do this myself.

Zhao Zhiyuan said: Now, many internal contradictions among the people have been exposed in various places. If political and legal work is not done well, the contradictions cannot be resolved.

Zhao Zhiyuan: (Library of Nanjing Normal College, former Director of the Law Department of Nanjing University)
After the abolition of the Law School, I have been extremely depressed for five years. My expertise cannot be used, and I waste my time in vain. This approach is really incomprehensible.

Now, many internal contradictions among the people have been exposed in various places. Politics is a tool. If political and legal work is not done well, the contradictions cannot be resolved. Especially in the legal field, law should serve socialist construction and the economy; law should distinguish right from wrong and resolve twists and turns. It has an important role. In terms of marriage law alone, issues such as family, marriage, and child custody, everyone has their own reasons, how can people be convinced? Solving problems is not simple. Marxism-Leninism, policies, and decrees are guiding principles, but laws must be used to solve specific practical problems. To have the rule of law, everyone must understand the law; however, the rule of law is not complete now, and the general principles and specific rules of law have not been promulgated. There is no standard for judging cases. Therefore, a case can be judged in this way here, and in another place it can be judged in that way. Without law, there is no rule of law. We are a large country with a population of 600 million, with many courts and judges, but they do not understand how to enforce the law.

Now we have two views on the law. One is the view of some leaders: the law is very simple, and three or four sentences can solve the problem; the other is our view: the law is science and is not simple. Of course, it was inevitable that the government valued politics and economy in the past. Now it is a contradiction of internal problems, and the law is even more important.

There were originally not many people in China who studied law, and now they cannot play a role, which is a great pity. I have been teaching for more than 20 years, and now that I have stopped, I feel very indignant when I think about these situations. Nanjing University is a comprehensive university, but without social sciences, what kind of comprehensive university is it! We must call out loudly that Nanjing University should restore social sciences.

Zhu Xiujue said: The government's handling of the Law School during the restructuring of departments and faculties was the most rude.

Zhu Xiujue: (Library of Nanjing Institute of Technology, former Professor of Law at Nanjing University)
The government's handling of the Law School during the restructuring of departments and faculties in 1952 was the most rude. At that time, the leaders of Nanjing University told us that we were being merged into the East China Institute of Law in Shanghai. Some people had lived in Nanjing for more than 20 years and were unwilling to leave Nanjing. The leaders specifically came to persuade and mobilize, so everyone expressed their obedience to the assignment. However, after a long time, there was no movement, so we sent representatives to ask. The leaders said: "Are you still waiting!" At that time, the ideological reform had just ended, and everyone did not dare to speak. The leaders did not use persuasion to reason, but used force to suppress. This is the greatest spiritual blow, the most humiliating and painful thing in my life! I think the Communist Party handles problems too subjectively, too arbitrarily, unreasonably, and inconsistently.

The leadership is too short-sighted in doing so. Law is a tool of class rule, but it is also a very deep field of knowledge. Neglecting legal research is wrong. Now the old people have been overthrown, and the new people cannot be trained. If another five years pass, we will all be over 60 years old, and I am afraid it will be impossible. I am now reluctantly teaching Russian, which is being taken care of for survival. If what I learn is not used, what is the meaning of work?

Ke Xiangfeng said: Old law is not without merit.

Ke Xiangfeng: (Professor of English at Nanjing University, only recently started teaching, former Director of the Department of Sociology at Jinling University)
It should be admitted that old law and Marxism-Leninism are opposed and contain toxins; however, now it is ridiculous to beat old law to death with one stick, abolish the law school, and then take care of our lives. In fact, old law is not without merit. I have an example to illustrate:

Mr. Li Jinghan wrote a survey of the suburbs of Beijing, which was a sensation. Mr. Li is our colleague. He used to conduct surveys there. Now, he is using the methods of social surveying to conduct another survey. Although he was poisoned in the past, his thoughts, views, and positions have changed now, and he can exert a greater effect.

However, I don't know why the leaders don't pay attention to our science in this way?

Shi Guogang said: Some people say that social science is a spring chill, but I think the current field of international relations is a severe winter.

Shi Guogang: (Counselor of the Jiangsu Provincial People's Committee, former Professor of Political Science at Nankai University)
I am engaged in the study of international relations, but there is a joke here. Once, I was talking about international relations in the Counselor's Office where I currently work, but many people did not know this science.

Some people say that social science is a spring chill, but I think the current field of international relations is a severe winter, with no hint of spring.

There is also a small matter: Last September, Eisenhower spoke about the issue of challenges. I wanted to refute him, so I looked everywhere for the original text of his speech, but I couldn't find it anywhere. Finally, I asked the CPPCC to get it, but they still couldn't get it. I wanted to get some materials, definitely not to promote imperialism, but the leaders here seemed to be keeping secrets for imperialism. Therefore, in Nanjing, international relations as a discipline have become extinct.

In recent years, I have transferred to the Counselor's Office of the Provincial People's Committee, but I have not changed my career. I still want to study within the possible scope. But because the information is not public and I cannot get the materials, I have fallen far behind. International relations issues must be closely integrated with current work, so confidential materials can be made public, and the door to research can be opened wider.

    南京市十位学者
    对撤销南京大学法学院提出批评
    本报南京讯　南京市十位政治学、社会学、法律学的教授，对院系调整时撤销南京大学法学院的主观主义错误痛切陈词，提出了尖锐的批评，要求国家重视和充分使用政治学、法律学和社会学的人才。这次会议是5月16日下午由民主同盟南京市委员会召开的。
    高一涵说：南京有一大批搞法学工作的人，现在很多人都改行了，还有许多人没有工作岗位。
    高一涵：（江苏省司法厅长，前北京大学法学院院长）
    有人说南京大学重理轻文，其实，社会学、法律学更被轻视。马列主义哲学是一切科学的指导原则，但不能代替社会学、法律学；政府的政策方针也不可以代替法律。南京有一大批搞法学工作的人，现在很多人都改行了，还有许多人没有工作岗位。这是否说搞旧法的就不能搞新法？但是，北京有些司法工作的领导同志也是学的旧法，难道南京有旧法观的人是不能改造的吗？
    要巩固人民民主专政，就要加强法制，但谁来订法，现在审理案件时，法律条文上没有，有时判错了，有时就无法判案。
    记得1952年院系调整时把南大法学院取消了，领导上说：取消是国家政策要这样。我不同意这种说法，他们还要我作检讨，但我的思想还是不通。
    孙煦存说：马列主义是一切科学的基础，但不能代替社会学、政治学和法律学。
    孙煦存：（南京市司法局副局长，前南京大学国际法教授）
    政治、社会、法律究竟是科学还是万金油？是否有了马列主义就可代表一切？这个问题首先要解决。有人说这些是科学，但我们要社会主义的科学，你们是资本主义的一套，要从根拔掉。其实，马列主义不是从天上掉下来的，社会主义科学和资本主义科学是有联系的。
    一个政策的好坏要看实践效果。几年来，这个转业的政策效果很明显，法学研究工作退步了。如果把我们放在原来的岗位上，我想要比现在东一鎯头西一棒好一些。
    原因在哪里呢？
    第一，领导同志对专业思想和科学观点弄不清，好像马列主义就可以代表一切。马列主义是一切科学的基础，但不能代替社会学、政治学和法律学。
    第二，有宗派主义、自满情绪。领导上有些同志认为自己虽不懂自然科学，但社会科学是懂的，因为社会科学是阶级斗争，搞了多少年革命，难道还不懂社会科学么？这样就简单化了。对人是自满情绪，不是虚心帮助人。我们是有缺点的，但可以改造；可是领导上见了我们这批人就好像一个医生遇到重病人就讨厌，往太平间里送。
    朱约庵说：搞社会学的人还是可以改造过来，为国家贡献力量的。
    朱约庵：（江苏省人民委员会参事室参事，前南大社会学教授）
    今天开会是第一阵春风。
    高教部、南京大学把法学院一脚踢开。不久前，南京大学的党员负责同志在一次会议上说：撤销法学院错了。他只说了一句话。事实上撤销法学院给国家人民造成了很大的损失。
    我认为，即使说社会系是反动的，搞社会学的人还是可以改造过来，为国家贡献力量的。
    是不是学社会学的人都没有学问呢？我倒不以为然。例如资产阶级的人口论，是为资产阶级服务的，如果，我们今天加以很好的利用就可以为工人阶级改善生活服务了。其他如家庭问题、宗教问题、民族问题等等都是属于社会学的。有些人搬教条说苏联没有社会学，因此我们中国也不要社会学；其实苏联也是有的，是放在民族学里的。
    以十二年为期，向科学大进军，我们这些老弱残兵还有作用。至少在和帝国主义反动学说作斗争中，我们还可以起舌战作用，因为我们的老师是资本主义国家的学者，他们的“八卦阵”我们心里明白。我们还会各国文字。只要领导上用马列主义武装我们，我们愿意在对敌斗争中冲锋陷阵。
    王辉明说：我们都是五十多岁的人了，年龄不许可我们等待下去。
    王辉明：（南京师范学院美术教授，前南大政治系教授）
    政府对法学院的教授和一般知识分子的待遇是不同的。第一，解放后，高等学校的变动很大，但没有学语文的去教化学，而我们搞社会学、法律学、政治学的人却你到图书馆，他到参事室，你在教美术，他在教俄文。第二，知识分子改造的道路，是要通过自己的专业。但为什么学政法的人就没有这条道路来改造自己。不相信我们呢，还是不相信自己？第三，今天，国内教育处于极不平衡的状态中，历史学开了五朵花，而法律学只有法学一花独放。事实上，拿教书来说，没有新旧法的对比，道理就说不清。
    我们的问题，已经拖了五年了，我希望在下一个学年能够解决。我们都是五十多岁的人了，年龄不许可我们等待下去。
    陈毅夫说：南京大学和有关文教部门的党委负责人犯了三个错误。
    陈毅夫：（省人民委员会参事室参事，前金陵大学教授）
    社会科学是应该发展的。可是我们南京的社会学、政治学和法律学却遭到无理的轻视和沉重的打击。为什么会这样呢？我认为南京大学的和有关文教部门的党委负责人犯了三个大错误：
    第一，领导人文化水平低。解放后，我在南京大学住了两年，有一位领导同志给我们讲哲学，我问这位领导同志黑格尔的“绝对观念”是什么，领导人不懂装懂，说是“狗屁”。
    第二，文教领导部门对中央政策理解不够，甚至故意违背。
    第三，道德修养差，特权思想与优越感到达疯狂程度。南京大学的个别党员领导人以马克思主义经典作者自居。当时法学院有一个青年助教，因为他是团员，领导上就要大家都以他马首是瞻。知识贫乏的人就会压制批评，害怕批评。南京大学的领导上对有不同意见的人处处都在考虑报复打击。
    把知识分子当地主恶霸看待，这就是秦始皇的焚书坑儒作风。
    我们这些人是有缺点，也有些好的方面，并不像南京的文教领导人想像的那样坏；如果单单是只有南京的这批领导人，今天在场的人，至少我自己早已被杀掉了。
    建议中央考虑加强对文教方面的领导。
    吴学义说：我是搞法律的，我迫切要求归队。
    吴学义：（华东药学院图书馆，前南大法学院教授）
    我是搞法律的，而现在在图书馆里工作。这是使用不当，安排不妥。既不能从事教学，更不能从事法律研究，我迫切要求归队。因此我具体建议恢复南京大学的法学院，或在南京成立一个法学研究所，把旧的法学教授集中起来。
    客观上是不是需要呢？我觉得很需要。建国八年了，但现在法制还不健全，大家只是按政策方针办事。其实，世界上哪一个国家没有法律呢？没有法律，对工作影响很大。其实，几年来不能立法是有困难的，可是领导上又不肯使用我们这批懂一点法律的人。
    我现在承政府安排工作，实质上是给一碗饭吃。吃了不做什么工作，连我的孩子也说我是饭桶，但绝不是我自己要这样做的。
    赵之远说：现在各地纷纷揭发了许多人民内部矛盾，如不把政法工作搞起来，矛盾就不可能解决。
    赵之远：（南京师范学院图书馆，前南大法律系主任）
    取消法学院之后，五年来苦闷之极，专长不能发挥，白白浪费时间，这种做法真令人不能理解。
    现在各地纷纷揭发了许多人民内部矛盾。政治是一个工具，如不把政法工作搞起来，矛盾就不可能解决。尤其是法律方面，法律要为社会主义建设服务，为经济服务；法律要明辨是非，解决曲折，有重要的作用。光在婚姻法方面，家庭、婚姻、子女抚养等等问题，公说公有理，婆说婆有理，如何使人心服呢？要解决问题并不是简单的。马列主义、政策、法令是指导原理，但必须要用法律来解决具体实际问题。要法治，就要使大家懂得法；可是现在法治不完备，法学总则、分则都没有公布，判决案件没有标准。因此，一个案件在这里可以这样判，在另一个地方又是那样判。没有法律就没有法治。我们是六亿人口的大国，有许多法院和审判员，但他们不懂法律如何执行任务。
    现在我们对法律有两种看法。一种是有些领导同志的看法：法律很简单，三四句话可解决问题；另一种是我们的看法：法律是科学，不简单。当然，政府过去重视政治经济是必然的。现在是内部问题的矛盾，法律就显得更加重要了。
    中国本来研究法律的人不多，而现在不能发挥作用，那是太可惜了。我教了二十多年书，现在停下来了，想到这些情况真是十分愤慨。南京大学是综合性大学，而没有社会科学，这是算什么综合大学！我们要大声呼吁，南大应恢复社会科学。
    祝修爵说：院系调整时政府对法学院的处理是最粗暴的。
    祝修爵：（南京工学院图书馆，前南大法律系教授）
    1952年院系调整时政府对法学院的处理是最粗暴的。当时，南大的领导上告诉我们说是把我们并到上海华东法学院去的。有人在南京住了二十多年，不愿离开南京，领导上还特地来说服动员，于是大家表示服从分配。可是过了很久不见动静，我们就派代表去问，领导上说：“你们还在等呀！”当时，刚刚思想改造结束，大家不敢讲话。领导上不是用说服的办法讲道理的，而是用力量压制。这真是我一生以来精神上最大的打击，最耻辱最痛苦的事！我看共产党处理问题太主观，太武断，不讲理，前后反复无常。
    领导上这样做太缺乏远见了。法律是阶级统治的工具，但也是一门很深的学问，忽视法学研究是不对的。如今是旧的人被打倒了，新的人又培养不出来。如果再过五年我们就都快要六十岁以上的人了，恐怕不可得了。我现在是勉强在教俄文，那是为生存而被照顾。学非所用，工作有什么意义？
    柯象峰说：旧法学不是一点都没有可取之处的。
    柯象峰：（南京大学英语教授，最近才开课，前金陵大学社会系主任）
    应该承认，旧法学和马列主义是有对立的，是有毒素的；但是，现在把旧法学一棍子打死，法学院取消，又来照顾我们的生活，实在令人啼笑皆非。其实，旧法学不是一点都没有可取之处的。我有一个例子说明：
    李景汉先生写了北京郊区的调查，真是轰动一时。李先生是我们的同行，过去他在那里调查过，现在还是用社会调查学的方法又去调查一次。尽管过去沾了毒，而现在思想、观点、立场改变了，可以发挥更大的效果。
    可是，不知领导上为什么却这样不重视我们这门科学呢？
    史国纲说：有人说社会科学是春寒，我看现在的国际关系这一门是严冬。
    史国纲：（江苏省人民委员会参事室参事，前南开大学政治系教授）
    我是研究国际关系的，可是这里有一个笑话。有一次，我在我现在工作的参事室谈国际关系，很多人却不知道这门科学。
    有人说社会科学是春寒，我看现在的国际关系是严冬，一点没有春意。
    还有一件小事：去年9月艾森豪威尔讲了挑战的问题，我想驳他一下，就到处找人弄他讲话的原文，遍寻无着，最后请政协去搞仍没有弄到。我想弄点材料绝对不是替帝国主义宣传，可是这里的领导好像在替帝国主义保密。因此在南京的情况看，国际关系像这一门整个已经绝种了。
    几年来我是转业在省人民委员会参事室，可是我并没有改行，在可能范围内我还要钻研。但因为资料不公开，东西要不到，所以落后多了。国际关系问题是要和当前工作密切结合的，所以保密材料可以公开，研究之门可以开大一点。
