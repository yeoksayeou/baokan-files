	On the same day, various Japanese organizations held a countermeasure meeting in Tokyo for the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement, and passed a request to the Japanese government and the three organizations related to Sino-Japanese trade, requesting that before the conclusion of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement, issues such as the mutual establishment of commercial representatives and payment agreements must be resolved, and a more advanced agreement than the previous one should be concluded. The content of the agreement must be based on the demands of the people, and the realization of long-term and stable Sino-Japanese economic cooperation integrated with China's Second Five-Year Plan should be realized in the agreement, and it is hoped that the government will also send representatives to participate in the negotiations.
