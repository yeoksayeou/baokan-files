Xinhua News Agency Dispatch:
Beijing Street Residents and Others Participate in Municipal Party Committee Symposium
Criticizing Shortcomings in Vegetable Supply Work

According to Xinhua News Agency, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China held a symposium on vegetable supply issues on the 17th. Those invited to participate included street residents, farmers, salespersons, managers of collective catering units, and representatives from vegetable management departments, totaling more than forty people. At the meeting, everyone sharply criticized and exposed the shortcomings and problems in the work of vegetable supply units and raised many opinions on the city's banning of free vegetable markets.

Some street women reflected that after the free vegetable markets were banned, not only did the quantity and variety of vegetables decrease, but they were also not as fresh as before. The most troublesome thing was that state-owned and joint purchase and sales groups could not replace them. As vegetable stalls decreased, people had to queue for a long time to buy vegetables. In some places, queuing only allowed one to buy one type of vegetable; to buy another, one had to queue again. Many housewives said, why were all the vegetable vendors banned? They believed that although prices in the free market were slightly higher in the past, it was very convenient. Agricultural cooperative members from rural areas raised different views on this issue in their speeches. They said that many farmers were not satisfied with the cancellation of free vegetable markets because they could no longer sell vegetables to vendors at higher prices. However, from the perspective of the interests of the entire production cooperative, there are many benefits after the ban. This can consolidate agricultural cooperatives and allow farmers to concentrate on production. Before the ban, many farmers, seeing the profitability, requested to withdraw from the cooperative to work individually, and some requested more private plots to grow vegetables, and did not care about the entire cooperative. In addition, because profiteering vegetable vendors charged very high prices, many farmers did not fulfill the supply contracts signed with state-owned vegetable companies, significantly reducing the company's supply and failing to guarantee market supply.

Many canteen managers from institutions and schools stated in their speeches that vegetable supply departments have serious shortcomings in operation and management, and have rarely improved in recent years. They said that the biggest shortcoming is great blindness, many management links, failure to consider the convenience of consumers, unreasonable allocation and distribution, and seasonal contradictions that cannot be resolved for a long time, sometimes resulting in stockpiles, sometimes in shortages, often causing large quantities of vegetables to rot. Everyone cited many examples, saying that they often went to designated vegetable stations to buy vegetables, waited for a long time but couldn't buy any. Some catering units with hundreds or thousands of people could sometimes only buy dozens of kilograms of vegetables, and paying and getting receipts also required queuing for several hours. Some vegetable stations, on the other hand, were stockpiling large quantities of vegetables, letting them rot and deteriorate, and did not allow anyone to purchase them. What was even more infuriating was that, in order to promote the blindly purchased and transported vegetables, vegetable companies also implemented forced bundling; if you didn't accept it, they would even stop supplying you or make things difficult for you everywhere. They said that in the past, with free markets, they could spend a little more money to buy some vegetables to make up for shortages, but now that's not possible.

Everyone also raised concerns about the particularly high prices of vegetables this year, believing that in addition to reasons such as rural areas suffering from disasters, increased production costs, and seasonality, it was also related to the vegetable company's large organization, many management links, high costs, and frequent spoilage losses. Everyone requested that relevant production and supply departments should carefully study and solve this problem, and regularly announce price changes and reasons in newspapers.

A vegetable salesperson cited numerous facts to expose the bureaucracy of commercial leadership. He said: I sell vegetables all day, but I have no idea what will be delivered each day, or in what quantity? Making plans is completely useless. He said that, according to consumers, many of the vegetables we sell are not suitable for needs, let alone fresh. Although we constantly raise suggestions to the leadership, they care about how to complete sales tasks and rarely consider consumer opinions to improve the work. Sometimes, in order to emphasize saving transportation costs, hundreds of kilograms of unneeded or already stockpiled vegetables are suddenly transported in. We salespeople are worried for the customers, but there is nothing we can do.

    北京街道居民等参加市委召开的座谈会
    批评蔬菜供应工作上的缺点
    据新华社讯　中共北京市委17日举行蔬菜供应问题座谈会。被邀参加的有街道居民、农民、售货员、集体伙食单位的管理人员和蔬菜经营部门代表等四十多人。会上，大家尖锐地批评和揭发了蔬菜供应单位工作上的缺点和问题，对全市取缔蔬菜自由市场也提出许多意见。
    一些街道妇女反映，蔬菜自由市场取缔后，不但菜的数量、品种减少，也不如过去新鲜了，最麻烦的是国营和蔬菜联购联销组代替不了，菜摊减少，买菜得排很长时间的队。有的地方排一次队只能买一种菜，再买就得排第二次队。许多家庭妇女说，为啥把菜贩都取缔掉？他们认为过去自由市场上虽然价格稍高些，但很方便。来自农村的农业社员在发言中，对这个问题提出了不同的看法。他们说，取消蔬菜自由市场，很多农民并不满意，因为他们再不能以较高的价格向菜贩卖菜了。但从整个生产社的利益看，取缔后有很多好处，这可以巩固农业社，使农民安心生产。在取缔前，不少农民因看到这有利可取，就要求退社单干，有的要求多留自留地种菜，对整个社就不关心了。另外，由于倒卖赚钱的菜贩收价很高，许多农民都不执行和国营蔬菜公司订的供应合同，使国营公司货源显著减少，不能保证市场供应。
    许多机关、学校的伙食管理人员在发言中，认为蔬菜供应部门在经营管理上存在着严重缺点，几年来很少改进。他们说，最大的缺点是盲目性大，经营环节多，不为消费者的便利设想，调拨分配不合理，季节性的矛盾长期不能解决，时而积压，时而脱销，经常使大批蔬菜腐烂。大家列举很多事例说，往往到指定的菜站买菜，等了半天买不到菜，一些有几百人或上千人的伙食单位有时只能买到几十斤菜，交款开发票也得排队等几个小时。而有些菜站则积压着大批蔬菜，任其腐烂变质，也不允许去采购。更令人气愤的是，蔬菜公司为了推销盲目购运进来的蔬菜，还实行强迫搭配，不接受，甚至就停止供应，或处处给你为难。他们说，过去有自由市场，多花几个钱，还能买些菜调剂一下，现在也不行了。
    大家对今年的蔬菜价格特别贵也提出意见。认为除了农村受灾、生产成本提高和季节性等原因外，和蔬菜公司的机构庞大、经营环节多、费用大、经常腐烂损失等问题分不开。大家要求有关生产、供应部门应好好研究解决这个问题，定期在报纸上公布价格变动情况和原因。
    一个蔬菜售货员列举大量事实，揭发了商业领导上的官僚主义。他说：我整天卖菜，可是心里无底，也不知道每天会调来些什么菜、多大数量？作计划根本不起作用。他说，据消费者反映，我们售卖的菜很多不适合需要，更谈不到新鲜，尽管向领导上不断提意见，但他们关心的是怎样完成销售任务，很少考虑消费者的意见设法改进工作，有时，为了强调节省运费，突然几百斤不需要或已有积压的菜就捎运来了。我们当售货员的虽然替顾客着急，但也没有办法。
