Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, 9th. The Phnom Penh radio station broadcast yesterday a statement from the Royal Government of Cambodia, protesting the South Vietnamese army's incursions into Cambodian territory.

The statement said that on May 2nd, a South Vietnamese army unit intruded into Batu village in Svay Rieng province, near the Cambodian-Vietnamese border, disrupting public order and looting residents' property.

Cambodian and South Vietnamese troops came into contact, resulting in one South Vietnamese soldier being killed and eight others (including one officer) being captured.

The International Commission has already investigated this incident.

The statement pointed out that this is not the first time the Cambodian border has been subjected to incursions by South Vietnamese troops. In 1956, South Vietnamese troops committed forty-three such acts of aggression.

The statement emphasized that Cambodia pursues a purely neutral policy, and it does not allow any foreign country to establish military bases on its territory for the purpose of invading neighboring countries. The Cambodian army does not invade the territory of other countries, nor does it allow the territory of its own country to be invaded by the armies of other countries.

    柬埔寨王国政府
    抗议南越屡犯边境
    新华社金边9日电　金边电台昨天发表柬埔寨王国政府的声明，抗议南越军队侵犯柬埔寨的领土。
    声明说，在5月2日一支南越军队侵入临近柬—越边境的柴桢省的巴图村，扰乱了治安，抢掠了居民的财产。
    柬埔寨和南越的军队发生接触，南越的一个士兵被击毙，另有八名（包括军官一名）被俘。
    国际委员会已经就这个事件进行了调查。
    声明指出，这已经不是柬埔寨边境第一次遭受南越军队的侵袭。在1956年，南越军队有过四十三次这种侵犯的行为。
    声明强调说，柬埔寨实行一个纯中立的政策，它不允许任何外国为了侵略邻国的目的在它的国土上建立军事基地，柬埔寨的军队不侵犯别国的领土，它自己的领土也不允许别国的军队侵犯。
