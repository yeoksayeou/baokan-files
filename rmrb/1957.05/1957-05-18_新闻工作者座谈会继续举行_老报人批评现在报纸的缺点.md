Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 17th. The Capital News Workers' Symposium continued on the 17th. Chen Mingde said:

	The Newspaper's Entertainment Value and Ideological Content Are Not Contradictory

The veteran journalist Chen Mingde introduced the growth process of Xinmin Evening News at the meeting. Then, he also talked about some of his views on journalism. He said: "Newspapers are people's spiritual food, and journalists are chefs. It is not enough for chefs to only pay attention to nutritional value and not pay attention to color, aroma, and taste. Entertainment value and ideological content are not contradictory, just as color, aroma, taste and nutrition are not contradictory."

Chen Mingde put forward two suggestions: First, increase the number of non-Party newspapers. Can we advocate the establishment of cooperative newspapers? Second, Beijing should have an evening newspaper. Zhang Youluan said:

	"A Reporter Who Isn't Disliked Isn't a Good Reporter
	A Newspaper Office That Doesn't Cause Trouble Isn't a Good Newspaper Office"

The veteran journalist Zhang Youluan expressed his opinions on the status of journalists. He believes that journalists are not yet trusted and respected. He said that if journalists have ideas of privilege, that is certainly wrong. However, it is also wrong for many bureaucrats to feel that journalists are a few grades lower. Some people say that reporters are flies, but they are actually bees that can make honey.

Zhang Youluan said that in the old society, there was a saying: "A reporter who doesn't go to jail is not a good reporter; a newspaper office that isn't shut down is not a good newspaper office." What about now? He believes that it can be said: "A reporter who isn't disliked is not a good reporter; a newspaper office that doesn't cause trouble is not a good newspaper office."

He also expressed his opinions on the content of current newspapers. He said that newspapers are not afraid of being softer, as long as they are hard in the soft. Zhang Youluan believes that some of the current newspaper editorials are not editorials, but "corporate mottos." There is also too little news. Such newspapers that publish news less and later are not good newspapers.

Talking about newspaper layout, he said that current newspapers never pay attention to or intend to have national characteristics and national language. He also said that he is most opposed to horizontal typesetting in newspapers. If it is for Latinization, who knows what year that will be? Why can't we wait until Latinization is implemented before using horizontal typesetting? He suggested that Beijing run a popular newspaper. Xiao Li said:

	News is often monopolized by Xinhua News Agency and People's Daily

Xiao Li, a reporter from Ta Kung Pao, made sharp criticisms of sectarianism among journalists. He said that news is often monopolized by Xinhua News Agency and People's Daily, and they have no way to compete!

He is dissatisfied with the work of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. He said that a few days ago, they wrote a letter to the Propaganda Department, requesting them to express their opinions on the state of newspaper discussions on news, but after waiting and waiting, three days have passed and they have not received a reply. Wang Yunsheng said:

	Newspapers Report Good News But Not Bad News, and Journalists Have Low Labor Productivity

Wang Yunsheng, the director of Ta Kung Pao, raised two issues: one is the one-sidedness of propaganda; the other is the low labor productivity of journalists.

He said that current newspapers report good news but not bad news, concealing evil and publicizing good. The bright side reported in the newspapers is all factual, but it does not mean that there are no shortcomings in the work, but the newspapers rarely report them. He also said: "Ta Kung Pao mainly reports on finance and economics. Financial and economic propaganda is not something that is tasteless to eat and a pity to discard; it can be greatly amplified. But this depends on the extent to which the leadership supports it, the depth to which we ourselves understand it, and the proper mastery of policies."

Regarding labor productivity, he said that before liberation, it was very disgraceful for reporters not to take notes, but now reporters do not take notes and editors do not edit, and productivity is quite low.

Today, Ding Baofang, a reporter from the Beijing branch of Xinhua News Agency, Xia Jingfan, a reporter from People's Daily, Fan Sifu, deputy editor-in-chief of People's Railway News, Zhou You, deputy director of Beijing Daily, Zhao Qi, a reporter from People's Shipping News, and Zhu Fengzao, a reporter from China News Agency, also spoke at the meeting.

    新闻工作者座谈会继续举行
    老报人批评现在报纸的缺点
    本报讯　首都新闻工作座谈会17日继续进行。陈铭德说：
    报纸趣味性和思想性不矛盾
    老报人陈铭德在会上介绍了新民报成长的过程。接着还谈了一些他对新闻工作的看法。他说：“报纸是人们的精神食粮，新闻工作者是厨师。厨师要是光注意营养价值，不注意色、香、味不行。趣味性和思想性不矛盾，正像色、香、味和营养不矛盾一样。”
    陈铭德提出二点建议：一、增办非党报纸，能不能倡办同仁报纸？二、北京应该有晚报。张友鸾说：
   “记者不讨厌　不是好记者
    报馆不闯祸　不是好报馆”
    老报人张友鸾针对着新闻工作者的地位发表意见。他认为现在的新闻工作者尚未被信任和尊重。他说，新闻记者如果有特权思想，那当然不对。但有许多官僚主义者觉得记者小三级，那也不对。有人说记者是苍蝇，其实是蜜蜂，能够造蜜。
    张友鸾说，旧社会有句话：“记者不坐牢，不是好记者；报馆不封门，不是好报馆。”现在呢？他认为可以这样说：“记者不讨厌，不是好记者，报馆不闯祸，不是好报馆。”
    对现在报纸的内容，他也发表了意见。他说，报纸不怕软些再软些，只要软中有硬。张友鸾认为现在某些报纸的社论不是什么社论，而是“社训”。新闻也太少。这种少登、迟登新闻的报纸不是好报纸。
    谈到报纸的编排，他说，现在的报纸从不注意也不打算有民族特色和民族语言。他还说，他最反对报纸横排。如果说为了拉丁化，那还不知道那一年？为什么不能等到实行拉丁化时，再来横排呢？他提议北京办个通俗报。萧离说：
    新闻常被新华社和人民日报垄断
    大公报记者萧离对新闻工作者中的宗派主义提出了尖锐的批评。他说，新闻常被新华社和人民日报垄断，他们想竞赛，都无从竞赛起！
    他不满意中宣部的工作。他说，前几天他们给中宣部写了封信，要求对报纸讨论新闻的状况发表意见，可是等来等去，三天过去了，还没有接到回信。王芸生说：
    报纸报喜不报忧，新闻工作者劳动生产率低
    大公报社长王芸生提出两个问题：一个是宣传的片面性；一个是新闻工作者劳动生产率低的问题。
    他说，现在的报纸是报喜不报忧，隐恶扬善，报上登的光明面，都是事实，但并不是工作中一点缺点没有，报上却很少报道。他又说： “大公报主要是报道财经的，财经宣传并不是食之无味，弃之可惜的东西，可以大放大鸣。但这要看领导支持到什么程度，我们自己认识到什么深度，掌握政策要恰到好处。”
    关于劳动生产率，他说，解放前，记者不记很不光彩，可现在记者不记，编辑不编，生产率相当低。
    今天在会上发言的还有新华社北京分社记者丁宝芳，人民日报记者夏景凡，人民铁道报副总编辑范四夫，北京日报副社长周游，人民航运报记者赵琪、中国新闻社记者朱凤藻。
