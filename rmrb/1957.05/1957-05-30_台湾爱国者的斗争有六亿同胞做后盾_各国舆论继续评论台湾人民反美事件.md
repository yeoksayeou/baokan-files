Xinhua News Agency Report: International public opinion continues to comment on the anti-American incidents in Taiwan. There is a consensus that the anti-American struggle of the people of Taiwan represents a great and just action of the Asian people against aggression.

Moscow newspapers have been reporting on the anti-American incidents in Taipei in detail for several days. The newspapers also published comments on the incident on the 29th. "Pravda" wrote that 600 million Chinese people are united in their determination, they hate the American colonialists and cannot tolerate the atrocities of the American aggressors on the sacred territory of Taiwan. "Soviet Russia" said that the essence of the Taiwan incident is that the American millionaires who wanted to attack People's China from Taiwan have suffered a moral and political blow. Hatred for American occupiers and colonialists is maturing everywhere.

The Korean "Rodong Sinmun" published an editorial on the 29th entitled "The Flames of the Increasingly Fierce Anti-American Movement," saying that the anti-American demonstration by the people of Taiwan is a matter of great international significance. It is not only an outbreak of the strong anti-American sentiment of the people of Taiwan, but also an outbreak of the common anger of the people of Asia and the world against the American aggressors. Therefore, public opinion in Asia and around the world is warmly supporting the patriotic anti-American demonstrations of the people of Taiwan and denouncing the domineering and barbarous behavior of the American aggressor groups.

"Slovak Truth" commented on the anti-American demonstration in Taipei on the 28th, saying that the significance of the Taipei incident goes far beyond the scope of Taiwan. This incident shows that anti-American sentiment also prevails in those areas where the American ruling group believes their position is 100% guaranteed. The newspaper emphasized that the patriots of Taiwan are not isolated in their struggle. They have the support of all the Chinese people and progressive world public opinion. With this support, the people of Taiwan will eventually be able to drive out the American occupiers.

The Bulgarian "Workers' Cause" published an article on the 28th commenting on the anti-American demonstration in Taipei. The "Workers' Cause" article pointed out that the anti-American demonstration in Taipei very clearly demonstrated the strong national feelings of the residents of Taiwan and their strong desire to oppose foreign rule. The residents of Taiwan have been and are invincible.

The London "Daily Worker" published an editorial on the 28th, believing that the reasons for the recent anti-American incidents by the people of Taiwan are far more profound than the rude behavior of the US military. The editorial mentioned the following facts: The fact that the murderer Reynolds was not tried in a Taiwanese court shows that Taiwan is not independent; the establishment of missile bases by the Americans in Taiwan is a belligerent provocation against the residents of Taiwan. The editorial said that while the people of Taiwan are showing their unwillingness to tolerate the arrogance of the Americans, the British and other Western European governments are fighting with the American overlords on the issue of relaxing trade restrictions with China. The editorial hopes that Britain will turn the legend of independently expanding trade with China into reality.

The British Conservative Party's "Daily Telegraph" commented on the anti-American demonstration by the people of Taipei, believing that the demonstration may be an outbreak of long-accumulated dissatisfaction with the United States, rather than simply the result of Chinese people's indignation at the American military court's trial. The newspaper pointed out that the Chinese in Taiwan are resentful of everything from the stationing of American troops in Taiwan to the destruction of Chinese customs and traditions by American influence.

The Burmese "Yangon Daily" said: "This incident shows that there are many Chinese in Taiwan who have strong patriotic ideas. The United States has used various methods to prevent the Kuomintang from cooperating with the mainland again. Chiang Kai-shek and a small group of people can bow their heads and endure the destructive actions of the United States, but the patriotic people of Taiwan cannot tolerate it. This incident is a manifestation of the patriotic actions of the people of Taiwan."

Pakistan's "Today" newspaper pointed out in an editorial on the 28th that the anti-American demonstration in Taipei showed the Taiwanese people's resentment of American enslavement. "Today" said that it is understandable that American officials are angry and surprised by this demonstration. "They have always believed that the place where they have spent billions of dollars is their safe base." The newspaper pointed out that no means can suppress the urgent demand for freedom.

The Singapore English newspaper "Straits Times," run by the British, believes that the United States should not retain extraterritorial rights for its overseas military personnel. The newspaper said in an editorial commenting on the anti-American demonstration in Taiwan that American soldiers, no matter where they are stationed, should be tried in the relevant national civil court except for offenses under military law.

Shaken by the anti-American demonstration in Taipei, the American press continued to publish comments on the incident on the 27th and 28th. Beach, the Tokyo correspondent for the "Chicago Daily News," emphasized that the destruction of the American "Embassy" in Taipei proves that "anti-American sentiment is growing in almost all Asian countries where American troops are stationed." The "Wall Street Journal" wrote in an editorial that the anti-American demonstration in Taiwan raises a question about the entire policy of the United States regarding the stationing of troops in various countries. The editorial said, "The anti-Americanism expressed in this action is by no means an isolated phenomenon. The fact that a single spark can start a prairie fire proves how strong this latent emotion is."

    台湾爱国者的斗争有六亿同胞做后盾
    各国舆论继续评论台湾人民反美事件
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：各国舆论继续评论台湾反美事件。一致认为台湾人民的反美斗争，正是代表了亚洲人民反抗侵略的一种伟大的正义行动。
    莫斯科报纸连日来都详细报道了台北反美事件。报纸在29日还对这个事件发表了评论。“真理报”写道，六亿中国人民决心一致，他们痛恨美国殖民者，并且不能够容忍美国侵略者在神圣领土台湾的暴行。“苏维埃俄罗斯报”说，台湾事件的实质在于想从台湾攻击人民中国的美国百万富翁们，遭到了道义上和政治上的打击。对美国占领者和殖民者的仇恨到处都成熟了。
    朝鲜“劳动新闻”29日发表题为“日益炽烈的反美运动的火焰”的社论说，这次台湾人民的反美示威是一件具有极大国际意义的事。它不仅是台湾人民的强烈的反美情绪的爆发，而且是亚洲和世界各国人民反对美国侵略者的共同的怒火的爆发。因此，亚洲和全世界的舆论热烈声援台湾人民的爱国反美示威，痛斥美国侵略集团的横行霸道的野蛮行为。
      “斯洛伐克真理报”28日评论台北反美示威说，台北事件的意义远远越出台湾的范围，这次事件表明，反美情绪还遍及美国统治集团认为他们的地位百分之百有保障的那些地区。这家报纸强调指出，台湾的爱国者在他们的斗争中并不是孤立的。他们有全中国人民和进步的世界舆论的支持。有了这些支持，台湾人民将能够最终把美国占领者赶出去。
    保加利亚“工人事业报”28日发表文章，评论台北反美示威。“工人事业报”的文章指出，台北反美示威极其鲜明地表明了台湾居民强烈的民族感情和反对外国统治的强烈愿望。台湾居民过去和现在都是不可征服的。
    伦敦“工人日报”28日发表社论，认为最近发生的台湾人民反美事件的原因远比美军的粗暴行为更加深刻。社论提到了这样几个事实：杀人犯雷诺没有在台湾法庭上受审说明台湾并不独立；美国人在台湾建立导弹基地是对台湾居民的好战的挑衅行为。社论说，当台湾的老百姓表现不愿再忍受美国人的骄横态度时，英国和其他西欧国家政府正就放宽对华贸易限制问题同美国霸王进行斗争。社论希望英国将自管自扩大对华贸易范围的传说变成事实。
    英国保守党的“每日电讯报”在评论台北人民反美大示威的时候认为，这次示威可能是长期累积的对美国不满的爆发，而不单纯是由于中国人对美国军事法庭的审判感到愤慨的结果。这家报纸指出，台湾的中国人对于从美国兵的驻扎台湾到美国影响对中国习惯传统的破坏，都感到愤恨。
    缅甸“仰光日报”说：“这次事件说明台湾的中国人中有很多是具有强烈的爱国思想的，美国用种种办法破坏国民党重新与大陆合作。对美国的破坏行动蒋介石等一小撮人能低头忍受，但是台湾的爱国人民是不能忍受的。这次事件就是台湾人民爱国行动的表现。”
    巴基斯坦的“今天报”28日在社论中指出，台北的反美示威表现了台湾人民对美国奴役的愤恨。“今天报”说，美国官员们对于这次示威感到愤怒和吃惊是可以理解的。“他们一直认为他们花了亿万美元的地方是他们的安全基地。”这家报纸指出，任何手段都压制不了希望得到自由的迫切要求。
    英国人办的新加坡英文报纸“海峡时报”认为美国不应该保有对驻外军人的治外法权。这家报纸在一篇评论台湾反美示威事件的社论中说，美国军人，无论驻在什么地方，除了犯军法以外都应该受有关国家民事法庭的审讯。
    为台北反美大示威所震动的美国报界27日、28日继续就这次事件发表评论。“芝加哥每日新闻”驻东京记者比奇强调指出，台北美国“大使馆”被捣毁一事证明，“差不多所有驻有美军的亚洲国家的反美情绪都在增长”。“华尔街日报”在社论中写道，台湾的反美示威，向美国在各国驻军的整个政策提出了一个问题。社论说，“这种行动所表现的反美主义绝对不是孤立的现象。星星之火可以燎原这一事实证明，这种潜伏的情绪是多么强烈”。
