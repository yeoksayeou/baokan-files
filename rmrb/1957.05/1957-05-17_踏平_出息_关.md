Flattening the "Promise" Barrier
　　Xie Yi

These past few years, middle and primary school graduates have had to struggle laboriously to get through the "promise" barrier. It was like this the year before last, like this last year, and it's like this again this year.

In school, in the classroom, teachers talk about socialist construction and tell the story of Xu Jianchun's labor production. Many children, full of vigor, are eager to make glorious vows to the motherland. But returning home, crossing the threshold, they are met with the cold faces of their parents, older brothers, and sisters-in-law: "Carrying a hoe, hauling manure, that's really no promise!" And relatives and neighbors pour cold water from the side: "Look, so-and-so, didn't read much, but became a cadre, really capable." This barrier is not "one man guarding the pass, ten thousand cannot break through," but because those guarding the pass are parents, relatives, and neighbors, it does indeed increase the difficulty for children to break through.

Up to now, the idea that "cadres are superior," having more "promise" and "ability" than workers and peasants, remains a stubborn public opinion. If you think about it in detail, cadres neither farm nor build houses, so how can you say they have "promise" and "ability"? Let's make a hypothesis: If peasants didn't farm for a year, and workers didn't spin and weave for three years, I think the cadres would all starve and freeze to death. In that case, how can they be considered "superior"? Where exactly is the "promise"? Where is the "ability"? The reasoning isn't profound, anyone can figure it out, but they just don't bother to think.

Saying cadres don't have much "promise" or "ability" may seem a bit biased at first glance, but it's not very biased. Workers and peasants are directly involved in production, while cadres are merely organizers, indirectly involved in production. If we didn't need indirect involvement, and everything was direct, some things really couldn't be done directly. Cadres also play a significant role in socialist construction, which cannot be denied. It's also not very appropriate to view cadres as being in opposition to workers and peasants. But who is primary between workers and peasants and cadres? This is also very clear. But some people insist on seeing things upside down, reversing everything, not distinguishing between primary and secondary, not understanding the importance, so it's difficult to see clearly. As a result, the most promising and capable workers and peasants are seen as having no "promise" and no "ability."

There are two illusions that often cloud people's eyes: Illusion one: It seems that cadres have power and influence, and can order workers and peasants: "You must do this, do that." In reality, this command is merely gathering the opinions of the masses and conveying them. To put it bluntly, cadres are just mouthpieces and servants of the masses. Where does the power come from? Where does the influence come from? How can this be considered "superior"? Of course, there are individual cadres who genuinely believe they have power and influence, abuse their authority, and act recklessly, but this "good" situation never lasts long, and they will eventually be overthrown. Illusion two: Individual cadres' children go to school and go out in fancy cars, and their parents, older brothers, and sisters-in-law all benefit, living in Western-style houses and riding in cars, with a sense of "one son attains the Dao, the whole family ascends to heaven." But the new society does not allow such phenomena to exist. Everyone disallows it, so it cannot last. This kind of fact, which existed to some extent in the past, is spending the people's money for one's own comfort. This is not having "promise," but is the most lacking in "promise."

Where does the word "promise" come from? I haven't researched it. As the name suggests, "interest" probably refers to "interest" (on money). Sending money out, and receiving even more money back, seems to be called "promise," otherwise it's not "promising." Some parents, who spend money to provide their children with education, still want their children to be promoted and become rich in the future, to glorify their ancestors, and to recover an even larger sum of money. Otherwise, they scold them for not being "promising." Here, the relationship between parents and children is a relationship between money and money. This is an old idea left over from the old society. This idea is terrible and shameful.

The "promise" barrier, after enduring wind and rain, should be collapsing. As long as young people bravely break through, as long as parents and neighbors don't guard the pass, and young and old work together, it can be flattened.

### 踏平“出息”关

    踏平“出息”关
        谢逸
    这几年，中小学生从学校毕业出来，总得颇为费劲地去闯“出息”关，前年如此，去年如此，今年还是如此。
    在学校里，课堂中，老师们讲社会主义建设，说徐建春劳动生产的故事，许多孩子朝气勃勃，磨拳擦掌，早就为祖国许下了光辉的宏愿。但回到家中，一跨进门槛，便碰到父母兄嫂的冷冰冰的脸孔：“扛锄头，挑大粪，真没出息！”而亲友邻里，也从旁泼来一瓢冷水：“喏，人家×××，没读过什么书，倒当了干部哩，真有本领。”这关虽不是“一夫当关，万夫难破”，但因为把关的都是家长亲友和邻里，确也增加了孩子们闯关的困难。
    直到现在为止，认为“干部高人一等”，比工人农民有 “出息”，有“本领”，仍成为一种顽强的舆论。如果详细想一想，干部既不种田，又不会盖屋子，怎么说是有“出息”有“本领”呢？姑且来这么一个假设，比如：农民一年不种田，工人三年不纺纱织布，我看，干部就都要饿死冻死，如此这般，又怎能说是“高人一等”，究竟“出息”在哪里？“本领”在哪厢？道理并不深奥，任何人都可以想得出来，可就是不去想。
    说干部不怎么有“出息”和有“本领”，乍看起来好像是偏了一些，其实并不很偏。工人农民是直接参加生产的人，干部只不过是组织者，是间接参加生产的，假如不要间接，什么都来个直接，有些事，确是也直接不了的，干部在社会主义建设中，也起着不小的作用，这不容否认。将干部和工人农民对立起来看待也不见得很恰当。但工人农民和干部，究竟谁个为主呢？这也是浅明得很的事。但偏有人爱头朝地下脚朝天地去看，凡事一倒调来看，主次不分，轻重不明，就很难看得清楚。结果，将最有出息最有本领的工人和农民，看成了没有“出息”没有“本领”。
    有两种假象，常常蒙住了人们的眼睛：假象一：好似干部有权有势，可以命令工人农民：“你们要这么做，那么搞。”其实，这命令，只不过是把群众的意见，集中起来又传达下去而已。说穿来，干部不过做群众的传声筒、服务员而已，何来的权？哪来的势？这又怎能算得是“高人一等”？自然，也有个别干部真地认为自己有权有势滥用职权，胡作非为，但这总是“好”景不常，终会给大家摔下台去的。假象二：有个别干部孩子上学上街，有漂亮的小轿车，父母兄嫂也都沾了光，住洋房，坐汽车，大有“一子得道，全家升天”之概。但新社会是不容许这类现象存在的，大家不容许，它就无法长存，过去一度存在的这种事实，慷人民之慨，博一己之舒适，这不是有“出息”，却是最没有“出息”的。
   “出息”这一词儿，是从哪儿来的？我没有考据过。顾名思义，所谓“息”，大概指的就是“利息”吧。付一笔钱出去，又收一笔更多的钱回来，似乎就叫做“出息”，否则就是没有“出息”。有些父母，付一笔钱供给子女读书，仍是想子女将来升官发财，又能荣宗耀祖，又能捞回更大的一笔钱；否则就骂他没有“出息”。这里，父母和子女的关系，是钱和钱的关系，这是从旧社会遗留下来的旧念头，这念头是可怕的，也是可耻的。
   “出息”关，历经风吹雨打，该已是崩毁的时候了，只要青年们勇猛地去闯，只要家长邻里们不当关把守，而老幼合力，是可以将它踏为平地的。
