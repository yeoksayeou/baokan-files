Deputy County Head Bai Returns to His Village to Run a Cooperative

By our reporter Lu Sheng

There are many, many Communist Party members who find the greatest joy in living among the masses at all times. They participated in the revolution not to gain high office and generous pay, but wholeheartedly for the benefit of the people. They never covet higher positions and salaries, and are never obsessed with material enjoyment. Whenever they have the opportunity, they go to the grassroots, to the masses, and live and work with the working people for a long time. Bai Fangyu, the deputy county head of Gucheng County and a member of the Gucheng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, is one of the millions of such good party members. He is one of the first batch of county-level cadres in Hebei Province to request to return to his hometown to run a cooperative. In order to understand his situation after returning to his village to run a cooperative, I visited him and the Hebei Agricultural Cooperative of Baijia Village, which he leads, on a sunny day in early April.

A comrade from the Cang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party told me: The Hebei Cooperative was originally a relatively backward cooperative. How backward was it? According to their understanding: Many livestock died or were weak, a small number of cooperative members wanted to withdraw, cadres lacked confidence in their work, and the masses were uneasy about production. However, since Bai Fangyu returned to his village to run the cooperative, great changes have taken place in just over a month: the cadres who originally lacked confidence have gained confidence, the cooperative members who were determined to withdraw no longer want to, and all the cooperative members are actively engaged in spring plowing.

Bai Fangyu's hometown is in Baijia Village. During the most difficult years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, he was a leading cadre in this village. After 1944, he successively served as district assistant, county finance and grain section chief, deputy county head, and other positions. In these ten years of work, he has consistently maintained a fine style of hard work, simplicity, and close ties with the masses, and has thus been praised by the vast number of cadres and the masses.

Since the realization of advanced cooperativization, he has increasingly felt that the weakness of the lower levels is a serious problem. Therefore, when the central government put forward the call to "streamline the upper levels and strengthen the lower levels," he wrote a letter to Lin Tie, the secretary of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, expressing his views on the current agricultural cooperatives and stating his willingness to return to his village to lead the work of a cooperative. Lin Tie received his letter and immediately studied it with the provincial party committee and the Cangzhou prefectural party committee, and approved his request.

The people of Baijia Village held a welcome meeting to welcome him back to his village to run the cooperative. After the meeting, he took a walk around the village and the fields, and immediately broke into a cold sweat. He found that a large amount of manure was piled up in the village and had not been sent to the fields, there were only a few people working in the fields, the livestock sheds were so smelly that no one could enter, and many people were squatting by the corner of the wall sunning themselves. All of this showed that this village was still outside the spring plowing campaign. So he immediately took off the uniform he wore as county head, put on farmer's clothes, and visited the cooperative cadres' homes separately.

At night, he and the cooperative cadres studied the cooperative's work situation. Deputy Director Bai Yongzhou said: "There are too many problems in this cooperative, it's a complete mess." Bai Fangyu said: "Don't be afraid of chaos, as long as we lead everyone to work resolutely, loose sand can also be mixed into mud." Another deputy director, Bai Fangen, said: "At present, everyone from cadres to the masses lacks confidence in increasing production. It's almost time for sowing, but our manure has not been sent to the fields; now is the time to use livestock, but members of two teams have taken their livestock back to their own homes to feed them. Not many people have worked in the entire February and March, some cooperative members want to withdraw, and some young people want to go to the city. We are worried sick." Bai Fangping said: "A few days ago, the deputy secretary of the township party committee asked us to elect a director. We drew lots five times, but we couldn't decide. No one wants to clean up this mess."

Before returning to his village, Bai Fangyu knew that there were many problems in this cooperative, but he did not expect it to be so serious. Therefore, he felt even more that only by going deep into the cooperative could he truly discover the problems. After analyzing and studying with everyone, he found four reasons:

First, the accounts had not been published for more than a year since the cooperative was established, which was the main reason for the low morale of the cooperative members. Last year, this village belonged to a brigade of a joint cooperative of four villages. Because the joint cooperative was large, had many households, and the cadres lacked management experience, although the cooperative members were very enthusiastic about production last year and achieved great results in agriculture and sideline production, in addition to the distribution of grain, the income from sideline production had not been distributed to the cooperative members by the end of March. At the end of February, the joint cooperative was divided into single-village cooperatives. Although 2,297 yuan of sideline income was divided from the joint cooperative, only 433 yuan in cash was actually received, and it was still impossible to distribute it. Therefore, the cooperative members all said: "Forget it, it's useless to work."

Second, undemocratic management and failure to consult with the masses on matters were also reasons for the dissatisfaction of the masses. Last year, the cooperative borrowed money to buy 100 piglets. The cooperative members proposed to distribute them to each household to feed, but the cooperative cadres did not accept. They were collectively fed for more than a month, eating more than 1,000 kilograms of miscellaneous grains. As a result, half of them died, and half were malnourished. The cooperative cadres had no choice but to distribute them to the cooperative members to feed.

Third, all 197 livestock in the cooperative were concentrated for feeding last year, but there was no one in charge, and there was no system for feeding and using them. As a result, 61 died in the winter, and 42 are still very weak. Who could bear to ignore the continuous death and weakness of livestock? Therefore, some people automatically took their livestock home to feed them. They said: "It is beneficial to everyone to keep this livestock alive."

Fourth, last year, all the miscellaneous trees, jujube trees, etc., were attributed to the cooperative. Although the cooperative had sideline production, not a single penny was distributed. Therefore, the cooperative members did not even have pocket money to buy vegetables. It was because of so many problems that the cooperative members had no motivation to produce.

After learning about these situations, Bai Fangyu said: "I think the problems are roughly clear. Some need to be solved quickly, and some need to be solved gradually." Bai Yongzhou said: "Where do we start with so many problems?" Bai Fangyu said: "Should we first grasp the link of spring plowing and solve the remaining problems of the cooperative step by step in production, according to their urgency?" Everyone agreed with this approach, and then continued to study many specific methods.

They calculated an account. Relying solely on the existing livestock would not be enough to complete the planting by the time of wheat harvest. In order to sow in time, the solution was to concentrate the existing livestock to specialize in plowing and put the burden of sending manure and sowing on people. To this end, it is necessary to call on party members and cadres to take the lead in mobilizing everyone to overcome the difficulty of insufficient animal power by using human-drawn carts and human-drawn plows. At the same time, the cooperative committee should immediately hold a symposium for feeders to formulate a system for protecting and using livestock, ensuring that the existing livestock can complete the plowing task and that weak livestock are fattened regularly.

In order to strive for a bumper harvest of summer and early-maturing crops, it is necessary to mobilize all male half-laborers and women to hoe wheat and apply fertilizer. All 2,150 mu of wheat fields in the cooperative must be hoeed twice.

In order to stabilize and improve the enthusiasm of the cooperative members, it is necessary to mobilize the cooperative members who have taken their livestock home to automatically send the livestock back to the team. The cooperative guarantees to feed the livestock well. A few relevant cadres should be drawn out to immediately clear and publicize the accounts of last year, distribute the income from sideline production to the cooperative members, and send full-time cadres to develop the cooperative's sideline production and solve the difficulty of cooperative members lacking pocket money. In addition to actively taking the lead in participating in various productions, the cooperative cadres should also immediately divide the work to visit the seven cooperative members who requested to withdraw, solicit their opinions on the cooperative, and persuade them to settle down and produce. At the same time, they should also visit old farmers and encourage them to give the cooperative more ideas to help the cooperative overcome difficulties.

Having formulated these methods, it was already late at night, and everyone was very happy. The cooperative cadres who were originally not very confident in running the cooperative also gained confidence at this time. They said: "As long as we can do according to these methods, we can not only mix this loose sand into mud, but also build tall buildings in the future."

Bai Fangyu and the party branch secretary and the Youth League branch secretary separately convened party and Youth League member meetings. He called on everyone to take out the spirit of persisting in "tunnel warfare" in the past to carry out a blitz of spring plowing and to find all possible ways to overcome the current difficulties. Then he visited the seven cooperative members who wanted to withdraw from the cooperative one by one. Bai Yongdong was the most determined among the cooperative members who wanted to withdraw. Originally, he had four dissatisfactions with the cooperative: First, he was dissatisfied that all the miscellaneous trees and jujube trees were attributed to the cooperative last year; second, he was dissatisfied that the cooperative bought his 3,000 kilograms of alfalfa at too low a price; third, he was dissatisfied that some cooperative members did not work well and did not care for public property, and the cooperative did not care; fourth, he was dissatisfied that the accounts were not public and the private plots were too small. He had never talked to the cooperative cadres about these dissatisfactions in the past. Now that he met Bai Fangyu, he was very sincere and boldly raised them. Later, Bai Fangyu concentrated the opinions of the cooperative members who had been visited by other cooperative cadres and knew that the cooperative members' greatest dissatisfaction with the cooperative was precisely the above-mentioned points. Therefore, he specially convened a cooperative committee to study these opinions and decided that the accounts would be published soon; all the miscellaneous trees would be attributed to the cooperative members, and the jujube trees would adopt a three (cooperative) seven (cooperative members) profit-sharing system. The price of alfalfa was too low and the price would be re-compensated. Bai Yongdong said with emotion: "The cooperative's practices have already coincided with my wishes, so I will no longer mention the word withdrawal." After that, Bai Fangyu visited the old farmers separately, sincerely asking them to give more ideas to run the cooperative well. The old people put forward many good suggestions on planting. After the cooperative committee adopted these suggestions, the old people who had not been on the land for more than a year began to hoe wheat on the land again this year.

The day after Bai Fangyu arrived in the township, he bought a manure basket. Whether he was attending a meeting or going to the field, he had to carry a manure basket to pick up manure. Under his influence, the cooperative cadres who did not actively participate in production in the past also picked up manure baskets.

In order to publicize the accounts of last year as soon as possible, Bai Fangyu participated in labor during the day and helped the accountant with the accounts at night. After more than 20 days of hard work, he publicized the accounts of last year to all cooperative members on April 15, and distributed more than 1,000 yuan of sideline income to the cooperative members at the same time. Therefore, all cooperative members said happily: "As long as County Head Bai does not leave, it is no problem to run the agricultural cooperative well and strive for a bumper harvest!"

    白副县长回乡办社
    本报记者　鲁生
    有许多许多共产党员，他们以时时刻刻生活在群众中间为莫大的愉快。他们参加革命不是为了博得高官厚禄，而是一心一意为了人民群众的利益。他们决不贪图较高的职位和薪金，决不醉心于物质享受。只要有机会，他们就到基层去，到群众中去，长期同劳动人民一起生活，一起劳动。故城县副县长、中共故城县委委员白方玉，就是千百万个这样的好党员当中的一个。他是河北省第一批要求回乡办社的县级干部之一。为了了解他回乡办社后的情况，在4月初的一个晴朗的日子里，我到沧县白贾村去访问了他和他领导的白贾村和平农业社。
    中共沧县县委办公室的同志告我说：和平社原是一个比较落后的社。究竟落后到什么程度呢？按照他们的了解是：牲畜死亡瘦弱多，少数社员要退社，干部工作没信心，群众生产不安心。但是，自从白方玉回乡办社后，仅仅一个多月的功夫就起了很大的变化：原来没有信心的干部有了信心，坚决要退社的社员不退了，全体社员都积极投入了春耕生产。
    白方玉的老家就在白贾村。在抗日战争最艰苦的年代里，他就是这村的领导干部。1944年以后，他先后担任了区助理员、县财粮科长、副县长等职。在这十多年的工作中，他一贯保持着兢兢业业、艰苦朴素、密切联系群众的优良作风，因而受到广大干部和群众的称赞。
    自从实现高级合作化后，他越来越感觉到下层力量薄弱是一个严重的问题。因此，当中央提出“精简上层加强下层”的号召后，他就给中共河北省委书记林铁同志写信，提出他对当前农业社的看法，表明他愿意回乡领导一个社的工作。林铁同志接到他的信，立刻和省委、沧县地委研究，批准了他的要求。
    白贾村的人民为了欢迎他回乡办社，举行了一个欢迎大会。会后他到村里和田间转了一圈，立刻出了一身冷汗。他发现村子里堆着大批粪土没有往地里送，地里只有零零散散几个人在劳动，牲畜棚里臭的进不去人，好些人都蹲在墙角边晒太阳。这一切表明这个村还是处在春耕生产运动的外面呢。于是他立即脱下当县长时穿的制服，换上了农民服装，分别到社干部家里进行了访问。
    夜里，他和社干部研究社里的工作情况，副主任白永周说：“这个社的问题太多了，乱的简直是一盘子散沙。”白方玉说：“不要怕乱，只要我们领导大家坚决干，散沙也能和成泥”。另一个副主任白方恩说：“目前从干部到群众大家都没有增产信心。眼看快到播种时节了，可是我们的粪还没有送到地里；眼下正是使用牲畜的时候，有两个队的社员都把牲口牵回自己家喂了，整个二、三月里没有多少人出勤，有的社员要退社，有的青年要进城，愁的俺们没办法。”白方平说：“前几天，乡党委副书记叫选个主任，俺们抓了五次阄，都定不下来，谁也不愿意收拾这个烂摊子。”
    在没有回乡以前，白方玉就知道这个社问题不少，但没有想到这么严重。因此他更感到，只有深入到社里来，才能真正发现问题。他同大家分析研究后，找出了四条原因：
    第一、办社一年多没有公布账目，这是社员们生产情绪低落的主要原因。去年这村是属于四个村联合社的一个大队。因为联村社大、户多、干部管理没经验。虽然去年一年社员们的生产劲头很高，农、副业生产的成绩也不小，但是除了分粮食外，副业收入到3月底还没有分到社员手里。2月底联村社分成了单村社，虽然从联村社分回了两千二百九十七元副业款，但是实际只拿回了四百三十三元现款，还是没法下分。因此社员们都说：“算了吧，劳动了也是白搭”。
    第二、办社不民主、有事不和群众商量也是引起群众不满的一个原因。去年社里贷款买回一百头小猪，社员提出分到各户喂，社干部不接受。集体喂了一个多月，吃了一千多斤杂粮，结果是一半喂死了，一半养瘦了。社干部没办法才又分给社员去喂。
    第三、去年全社的一百九十七头牲畜全部集中喂养又没有专人负责，喂养使用也没个制度，结果一冬天就死了六十一头，现在还有四十二头也很瘦弱了。在牲畜不断死亡和瘦弱的情况下，谁能忍心不管呢？因此有些人就自动把牲口牵回家喂了。他们说：“保住这头牲口对谁也有利”。
    第四、去年把所有的杂树、枣树等都归了社，社里虽然有副业，但一个钱也没有分，因此社员们连买点菜吃的零钱都没有。就是因为有这么多问题，因此社员们都没有心劲去生产。
    白方玉在了解了这些情况后说：“我看问题已经大致明白了，有些是需要赶快解决的，有些是需要逐步解决的。”白永周说：“这么多问题从那里着手呀？”白方玉说：“我们是不是首先抓住春耕生产这一个环节，在生产中分别缓急逐步来解决社里的遗留问题。”大家都同意这种做法，接着又继续研究出许多具体办法。
    他们算了一个账，单靠现有牲畜到收麦时也种不完。为了及时播种，解决的办法是集中现有牲口专门耕地，把送粪播种的负担放到人身上。为此就要号召党员干部带头发动大家以人拉车人拉耧的办法克服畜力不足的困难；同时社委会要立即召开一次饲养员座谈会，制订出保畜用畜的制度，一面要做到保证现有的牲口能完成耕地任务，同时要定期把瘦弱的牲畜养肥。
    为了争取夏季和早熟作物丰收，要动员全体男半劳力和妇女锄麦浇粪。要把全社的两千一百五十亩麦田普锄两遍。
    为了稳定和提高社员们的生产积极性，要动员牵回牲口的社员自动地把牲口送到队里来，社里保证把牲口喂养好；要抽出几个有关干部，立即把去年的账目算清公布，把副业收入分给社员，派专职干部把社里的副业生产搞起来，解决社员缺少零花钱的困难；社干部除积极带头分别参加各种生产外，还要立即分工去访问七户要求退社的社员，征求他们对社的意见，劝说他们安下心来生产。同时还要分别拜访老农，鼓励他们多给社里出主意，帮助社里克服困难。
    订好这些办法，已经到了后半夜，大家非常高兴。原来对办好社信心不大的社干部到这时也有了信心，他们说：“只要能照这些办法去做，我们不光能把这盘子散沙和成泥，将来还能修起高楼大厦呢。”
    白方玉和党支书，青年团支书分别召开了党、团员大会。他号召大家拿出过去坚持“地道战”的精神来突击春耕，想尽一切办法克服当前困难。然后他又逐户访问了要退社的七户社员。白永栋是退社户里最坚决的。原来他对社有四点不满：一不满去年把杂树、枣树全部归了社；二不满社里收买他的三千斤苜蓿作价过低；三不满有些社员劳动不好，不爱护公共财产社里也不管；四不满账目不公开，自留地太少。他这些不满过去始终没和社干部谈过，现在他见到白方玉态度很诚恳，就大胆的提出了。后来白方玉把和其他社干部们分别访问社员的意见集中后，知道社员们对社最不满的也正是上述这几点，于是就专门召开社委会研究了这些意见，并决定：账目很快要公布；杂树全部归社员，枣树采取三（社）七（社员）分红制。苜蓿作价太低要重新补价。白永栋感动地说：“社里的这些做法已经和我的愿望大致相投了，因此我也不再提退社两字了。”此后白方玉又分别拜访了老农，诚恳地要求他们多出主意把社办好，老人们在播种方面提出了许多很好的建议。当社委会把这些建议采纳以后，一年多没上地的老人们今年又开始上地锄麦了。    白方玉到乡后的第二天，就买了一个粪筐，不论开会或下地都要背上粪筐拾粪，过去不积极参加生产的社干部在他的影响下也都背起了粪筐。
    为了尽快的公布去年的账目，白方玉白天参加劳动，夜里还要帮助会计算账，经过二十多天的努力，于4月15日给全体社员公布了去年的账目，同时还给社员们分配了一千多元副业款。因此全体社员都高兴的说：“只要白县长不走，办好农业社，争取大丰收没有问题！”（附图片）
