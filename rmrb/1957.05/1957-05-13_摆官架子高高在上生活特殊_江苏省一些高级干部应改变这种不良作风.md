Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 11th: Qian Yulian, Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee of the Jiangsu Provincial First-Level Party and Mass Organizations, criticized some responsible cadres of the Jiangsu Provincial First-Level Organizations for lacking the style of integrating with the masses at a recent enlarged meeting of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee.

Qian Yulian said: The requirement for senior cadres to share weal and woe with the masses was put forward during the launch of the campaign to increase production and practice economy. However, some senior cadres are still high and aloof, living a privileged life. The No. 33 Xikang Road Club in Nanjing is only for senior cadres to go to and play, and a cinema has also been specially built inside. The masses ask: Why can't senior cadres watch movies with the masses? For example, cadres above the thirteenth grade have special medical certificates, which give them priority in seeing a doctor, but when the doctor does not take good care of them, some cadres still act rudely. The masses also have opinions about certain senior cadres taking their spouses and children in cars to buy things, watch plays, and handle personal affairs.

Qian Yulian said: Now it is not easy for ordinary cadres in the organization to see the heads of departments. Sometimes, when they directly call the minister to ask for instructions, the minister's tone is very impatient, as if they should not directly ask him to solve the problem. Some cadres said: For senior cadres to connect with the masses, it would be good enough if they first connect well with the cadres in the organization.

Some cadres reported that the wife of a certain minister takes a leave of absence for recuperation for half a year at a time, does not work, but can go to the theater until late at night.

Qian Yulian said: The masses also reflected a noteworthy issue, namely, the higher the promotion of cadres, the heavier the burden and the greater the responsibility. However, some newly promoted senior cadres immediately become privileged in their lives and put on airs before they even start their new work. For example, some cadres feel that the house they used to live in is no longer good enough after they are promoted and want to live in a better house. Therefore, in order to vacate better houses for senior cadres to live in, many cadres have to move. Moreover, these vacated houses must be renovated before the minister moves in. Why were these houses very good when ordinary cadres lived in them in the past, but they must be renovated when senior cadres go to live in them?

Qian Yulian finally said: The phenomenon of certain senior cadres in Jiangsu Province being high and aloof and living a privileged life has improved in recent years, but it is far from thorough. Therefore, cadres in party and mass organizations hope that these senior cadres will share weal and woe with the masses and integrate with them through this rectification campaign.

### 摆官架子高高在上生活特殊  江苏省一些高级干部应改变这种不良作风

    摆官架子高高在上生活特殊
    江苏省一些高级干部应改变这种不良作风
    新华社南京11日电　中共江苏省一级党群机关党委副书记钱育莲在最近举行的一次中共江苏省委扩大会议上，批评了江苏省一级机关一些负责干部缺乏和群众打成一片的作风。
    钱育莲说：关于高级干部要与群众同甘共苦的要求，在开展增产节约运动时就提出来了。可是至今一些高级干部还是高高在上，生活特殊。南京市西康路三十三号俱乐部只有高级干部能去玩，里面还专修了一个电影院。群众问：高级干部为什么不能与群众在一道看电影呢？又如十三级以上干部看病有特约医疗证，可以优先看病，而当医生照顾不周时，有的干部还耍态度。群众对某些高级干部带着爱人、小孩坐小汽车去买东西、看戏、办私事也有意见。
    钱育莲说：现在机关中一般干部是不容易见到部首长的，有时直接与部长通电话请示问题，部长口气很不耐烦，好像不应该直接找他来解决问题。有些干部说：高级干部要联系群众，首先把机关干部联系好了就算不错了。
    有些干部反映有位部长的爱人一年半载地请假休养，不工作，但可以看戏到深夜。
    钱育莲说：群众还反映了一个值得注意的问题，即本来干部提升越高，说明担子越重，责任更大，但有些新提升的高级干部新工作还没开始做，马上在生活上特殊起来，架子也摆起来。如有些干部提升后，原来住的房子好像不能再住了，而要住更好的房子。因此，为了将较好的房子让出来给高级干部住，有不少干部只好搬家。并且，这些让出来的房子，在部长住进去之前，总要大小整修一番。为什么这些房子过去一般干部住得很好，而当高级干部去住时就必须修整呢？
    钱育莲最后说：江苏省某些高级干部高高在上、生活特殊的现象，近年来虽有改进，但很不彻底，因此党群机关干部希望这些高级干部通过这次整风，与群众同甘共苦，打成一片。
