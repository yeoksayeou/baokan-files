    The Welwitschia in the Desert
    In Southwest Africa, there is a desert plant called Welwitschia. The trunk of this plant is short and thick, only about a foot high. The trunk has only two leaves, which are split into many lobes. The desert climate is very dry, and sometimes it doesn't rain for years, but the Welwitschia can still stay green even in the driest times because it has roots that go deep into the ground, and its leaves are as tough as leather, making it difficult to lose moisture. It is said that the Welwitschia can live to be a hundred years old, and it only grows two leaves in its lifetime.

    沙漠中的百岁兰
    在西南非洲有一种沙漠中的植物，名叫百岁兰。这种植物的树干又短又粗，只有一尺高。树干上孤零零地长着两片裂成许多瓣的叶子。沙漠的气候是非常干燥的，有时几年不下雨，但是百岁兰在最干旱的时候仍能保持绿色，因为它有深入地下的树根，它的叶子像皮革一样坚硬，不易发散水份。据说百岁兰可以活到一百岁，它一生只长两片叶子。
