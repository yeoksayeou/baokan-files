    State Council Congratulatory Telegram
    To the People's Committee of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region:
    On the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the establishment of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, we express our warm congratulations to the Mongolian people and the people of all nationalities in the Autonomous Region with great pleasure.
    In the past ten years, under the direct leadership of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, headed by Comrade Ulanhu, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Committee, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has completed the democratic reforms and achieved a decisive victory in the socialist revolution; thus, the social and ethnic outlook of the Autonomous Region has undergone fundamental changes. At present, the socialist transformation of the entire region has been basically completed, great developments have been made in various economic and cultural constructions, the lives of the people of all nationalities have been improved and elevated, and the unity of all nationalities and the unity within nationalities have been increasingly strengthened and consolidated. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has become a good example of the autonomous areas of various nationalities in our country. The achievements of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are a part of the achievements of the socialist cause of the motherland. The victory of the people of Inner Mongolia is also the victory of the people of all nationalities in the country. The people of all nationalities in the country are delighted and encouraged by the brilliant achievements made by the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
    The experience of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region fully proves the correctness of the ethnic policies and the ethnic regional autonomy policies of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and also fully proves that the fraternal relations of equality, unity, mutual assistance, and cooperation among all nationalities are an important driving force for promoting the common progress and development of all nationalities. It is necessary to constantly consolidate and develop this fraternal relationship.
    We firmly believe that in the common cause of building a great socialist motherland in the future, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region will further strengthen the unity of all nationalities and the unity within nationalities, give full play to the enthusiasm of the people of all nationalities, vigorously develop economic and cultural undertakings, and advance more courageously for the construction of a socialist Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.

    国务院贺电
    内蒙古自治区人民委员会：
    当内蒙古自治区成立十周年的时候，我们以非常愉快的心情，向蒙古民族人民和自治区内的各民族人民表示热烈地祝贺。
    在已往的十年中，内蒙古自治区在以乌兰夫同志为首的中国共产党内蒙古自治区委员会和内蒙古自治区人民委员会的直接领导下，完成了民主改革，又取得了社会主义革命的决定性的胜利；从而使自治区的社会和民族的面貌发生了根本的变化。现在，全区的社会主义改造已经基本完成，各项经济和文化建设有了很大的发展，各民族人民的生活得到了改善和提高，各民族的团结和民族内部的团结也日益加强和巩固。内蒙古自治区已经成为我国各民族自治地方的良好榜样。内蒙古自治区的成就，是祖国社会主义事业成就的一部分。内蒙古人民的胜利也是全国各民族人民的胜利。全国各民族人民都为内蒙古自治区所取得的这些辉煌的成就而感到欢欣鼓舞。
    内蒙古自治区的经验，充分证明中国共产党和毛主席的民族政策和民族区域自治政策的正确，也充分证明各民族间平等、团结、互助、合作的兄弟关系是促进各民族共同进步和发展的重要动力。必须不断地巩固和发展这种兄弟关系。
    我们深信，今后在建设伟大的社会主义祖国的共同事业中，内蒙古自治区将会更进一步地加强各民族团结和民族内部的团结，充分发挥各族人民的积极性，大力发展经济和文化事业，为建设社会主义的内蒙古自治区更加奋勇地前进。
