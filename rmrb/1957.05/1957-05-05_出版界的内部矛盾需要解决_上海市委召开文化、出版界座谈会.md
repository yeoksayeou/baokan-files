Shanghai dispatch from our newspaper: On May 2nd, twenty-eight individuals from Shanghai's publishing and social culture circles raised many important issues in publishing work at a symposium convened by the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee.

Publishing professionals criticized the current practice of over-emphasizing professional specialization, "only one of its kind, no other branches." Zhao Jiabi, Deputy Editor-in-Chief of the Shanghai People's Fine Arts Publishing House, said: The current professional specialization of publishing houses, with only one of each kind, is not conducive to the "voicing" and "releasing" of writers' opinions, nor can it meet the needs of the people's cultural life. If one publishing house does not publish a writer's manuscript, there is no second place to submit it. Having only one of its kind is also detrimental to the publishing house, easily fostering bureaucratic work styles among editors. Anyway, even if writers are offended, they will still come knocking. Everyone doesn't have to bear economic responsibility, and the publishing house is guaranteed not to close down. Shanghai can establish more publishing houses, allowing writers to choose publishing houses to publish their works, and allowing publishing houses to compete with each other to form their own characteristics. The former "Kaiming" and "Shenghuo" bookstores all had their own characteristics. Qin Hezhen, an editor at the New Literature and Art Publishing House, also talked about the contradictions in division of labor between them and the Beijing People's Literature Publishing House. The Beijing People's Literature Publishing House's twelve-year plan included all foreign literary classics and recruited all well-known translators. After consultation, it was decided that Beijing would publish world classical literature, and Shanghai would publish world modern literature, but they would still publish the best works.

Large organizations and excessive staffing are also major problems in the current publishing industry. Many people pointed out in their speeches that the current ratio of editorial staff to administrative staff is one to four or five, which is very unreasonable. Li Xiaofeng, Deputy Director of the Editorial Department of Shanghai Culture Publishing House, said: In the past, the Beixin Bookstore had only ten or so editorial, publishing, and distribution staff at its lowest point, and everyone was proficient in their business, so they could publish more than 100 kinds of books a year. Now, the Culture Publishing House has about 160 people, many of whom have been transferred from other departments. They are not familiar with the business and need familiar people to help them, offsetting the strength. Qin Hezhen said: In the past, editors directly contacted authors, but now authors' letters have to go through receiving and dispatching, clerical staff, and then be transferred to the editor. After drafting, they have to go through review and other procedures, making everyone busy with administrative matters all day long. Shang Ding, Deputy Director of the New Knowledge Publishing House, said that he once replied directly to an author's letter, and the personnel department criticized him for being unorganized and undisciplined. Many people criticized the personnel department for abusing its power and not respecting the opinions of the editorial department. The people they need cannot be transferred in, and the people they don't need are constantly being transferred in. Zhao Jiabi said: The Shanghai People's Fine Arts Publishing House also took everyone in during the public-private partnership, and now there are more than 300 people. Many people are not suitable for editing, but the personnel department arranges them in the editorial department. The editorial department very much needs a party member cadre, but the party member comrade who was transferred in did not play an active role, but played a negative role. Publishing houses should be small and efficient. Some editorial work can be undertaken by university professors, writers, and other members of society. The former Zhonghua Book Company and Commercial Press both did this.

The quality of the current publishing house editors is not high, how to strengthen their training? Everyone also put forward many suggestions in their speeches. Shu Xincheng said that to train an editor who can work independently, it takes five years, or even ten years, for a college graduate, but some editors currently have very low levels, and many are transferred from other professions. This problem needs to be solved. Qin Hezhen also mentioned that there are not many people in the publishing house who can actually do editorial work, and the leadership has not paid attention to their training. Their political treatment is also low, and the editors are very depressed. Jiang Bin, Deputy Director of the Shanghai People's Publishing House, proposed that the current leadership methods of the Party, government, labor union, and Communist Youth League are all based on the methods of institutions and factories, such as holding meetings to discuss the significance of buying public bonds, which makes editors and staff often busy with meetings. Working, creating, and learning conditions are very poor.

Why is the quality of current publications not high? Why are there so many contradictions in publishing work? People believe that the higher-level leadership has a responsibility, and the writers also have a responsibility. The publishing departments alone cannot be blamed. Shu Xincheng of Zhonghua Book Company first affirmed the achievements made by the publishing industry under the leadership of the Party, and then used twelve words to criticize the leadership's bureaucracy: "Insufficient attention, insufficient understanding, weak leadership." He said that the leadership did not regard publishing work as an academic undertaking, but as a purely commercial business, pursuing numbers and indicators; the National Publishing Work Conference has not been held for seven years. Ying Yeping, an editor at the Shanghai Pictorial Publishing House, proposed that the leadership requires them to make annual plans every year and stipulates the genre and proportion, which in fact often cannot be completed. He hopes that the leadership will not limit them too much and blindly pursue numbers. Hu Yan, Director of the Shanghai Culture Publishing House, talked about their investigation of twenty-six factories and schools. Readers like to read classical literature because of its strong storytelling; while popular literary works that reflect reality are not very popular with readers because the works are formulaic and conceptualized. He hopes that writers will create more modern and popular literary works. Chen Xiangming, Deputy Director of the Children's Publishing House, said that last year the People's Daily published an editorial calling on writers to create more for children, but many writers who made plans have not fulfilled them and are unwilling to write for children.

People from Xinhua Bookstore, libraries, and museums also spoke at the meeting. People from Xinhua Bookstore believe that some criticisms of them in society are unfair and that their difficulties are not understood enough. Ke Qingshi, First Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, said at the end of the meeting: The publishing industry's criticism of the leadership for not paying enough attention is correct. The Municipal Party Committee has not done a good job in grasping publishing issues in the past. Starting today, we can carefully study the issue with relevant departments to see which issues should be resolved first; some issues are more complicated and need to be studied carefully. He also encouraged everyone not to be afraid of criticism. Criticism is always good, and shortcomings should be corrected. If it is indeed wrong, you can also appeal. Through contention, everyone can clarify the facts and improve their work.

### 出版界的内部矛盾需要解决  上海市委召开文化、出版界座谈会

    出版界的内部矛盾需要解决
    上海市委召开文化、出版界座谈会
    本报上海专电　上海市二十八位出版、社会文化界人士，在2日上海市委召开的座谈会上，提出了出版工作中的许多重要问题。
    出版界人士批评了目前出版过分强调专业分工，“只此一家，别无分设”的做法。上海人民美术出版社副总编辑赵家璧说：现在出版社作了专业分工，只此一家，不利于作家的“鸣”“放”，也不能满足人民文化生活的要求。作家的稿件，一家不出，就没有第二家好投。只此一家，对出版社也不利，容易养成编辑人员的官僚主义作风。反正得罪了作家，作家还是会找上门的。大家不用负经济责任，出版社也保险不会关门。上海可以多办几家出版社，作家可以选择出版社出版自己的著作，出版社之间，也可以互相竞赛、竞争，形成自己的特点。过去的“开明”、“生活”等书店，就都有自己的特点。新文艺出版社编辑秦鹤?还谈到他们和北京人民文学出版社在分工上的矛盾。北京人民文学出版社的十二年规划把所有外国文学名著都列入计划，并且网罗了所有知名的翻译家。经过协商以后，才确定北京出版世界古典文学，上海出版世界近代文学，但是优秀的还是让他们出。
    组织庞大，冗员过多，也是目前出版界的一大问题。很多人在发言中指出现在编辑人员和行政人员的比例是一比四到五，非常不合理。上海文化出版社编辑部副主任李小峰说：过去的北新书店编辑、出版、发行人员最少时只有十多人，每个人都精通业务，因此一年也出一百多种书，现在文化出版社却有一百六十人左右，很多人是其他部门转来的，他们不熟悉业务，还要熟悉的人去帮助，抵消了力量。秦鹤?说：过去编辑和作者直接联系，现在作者来信要经过收发、文书再转给编辑，拟稿后还要经过核稿等手续，弄得大家整天忙于事务。新知识出版社副社长尚丁说，他曾经直接复了作者一封信，人事科批评他无组织无纪律。很多人都批评人事科滥用职权，不尊重编辑部门的意见，需要的人调不到，不需要的人不断调进来。赵家璧说：上海人民美术出版社也是由于公私合营时，把所有的人都包了下来，现在有三百多人。有许多人不适于做编辑，也由人事部门安排在编辑部。编辑部很需要有个党员干部，结果，调来的一位党员同志不起积极作用，反起消极作用。出版社要办得短小精悍。有些编辑工作，可以邀请大学教授、作家等社会人士来担任。过去的中华书局、商务印书馆都这样做过。
    目前出版社编辑人员质量不高，如何加强对他们的培养？大家在发言中也提出了不少意见。舒新城说，要培养一个能独立工作的编辑，以一个大学毕业生来说，需要经过五年的努力，甚至十年，但是目前有些编辑水平很低，许多是转业来的，这个问题要解决。秦鹤?并谈到出版社实际能做编辑工作的人不多，而领导上没有重视对他们的培养，政治待遇上又低，编辑很苦闷。上海人民出版社副社长姜彬提出，目前党政工团的领导方法都是按照机关、工厂的一套方式，如买公债也要开会讨论意义，使编辑工作人员常常忙于开会，工作、创作、学习条件都很差。
    目前出版物质量为何不高？出版工作为何存在这样多矛盾？人们认为上级领导有责任，作家也有责任，不能单责备出版部门。中华书局舒新城在首先肯定出版界在党的领导下所取得的成绩之后，接着用十二个字批评领导上的官僚主义：“重视不够、了解不够、领导不强”。他说，领导上没有把出版工作看做是学术性的事业，而看成是单纯的商业，追求数字和指标；全国出版工作会议已经七年未开。上海画片出版社编辑应野苹提出，领导上每年都要下面订全年计划，并且规定体裁、比重，事实上常常不能完成。他希望领导上不要限得太死，盲目追求数字。上海文化出版社社长胡炎谈到他们调查二十六个工厂、学校，读者都喜爱阅读古典文学，主要原因是故事性强；而反映现实的通俗文艺作品受读者欢迎的就不多，主要原因是作品公式化、概念化。他希望作家多多创作近代的通俗的文艺作品。少年儿童出版社副社长陈向明说，去年人民日报发表社论，号召作家多为儿童创作，许多作家订了计划都没有兑现，多不愿意为儿童写稿。
    新华书店、图书馆、博物馆等方面的人士，在会上也发了言。新华书店方面认为社会上对他们的批评有些不公允，对他们的困难体谅不够。上海市委第一书记柯庆施在会议最后说：出版界批评领导上不重视，这是对的，市委过去没有很好抓出版问题。从今天开始，可会同有关部门仔细研究一下，看看首先解决哪几个问题；有些问题比较复杂，要好好研究。他并勉励大家不要怕批评，有批评总是好的，有缺点就应该纠正，如果确实不对的，你们也可以申诉。经过争鸣，大家可搞清事实，改进工作。
