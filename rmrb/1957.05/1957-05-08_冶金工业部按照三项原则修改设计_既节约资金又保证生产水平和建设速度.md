    Beijing News: The design personnel of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, in accordance with the principle of "building the country through diligence and thrift," have re-examined and revised the design drawings of newly built and renovated enterprises. On the condition of ensuring and improving the original designed production level and construction speed, it is preliminarily estimated that over 30 million yuan of construction investment can be saved this year. At the beginning of this year, when the State Economic Commission was balancing the basic construction plan, it considered slowing down the construction speed of the Baotou Iron and Steel Company due to insufficient funds. Now, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry has saved 30 million yuan from the design, so the Baotou Iron and Steel Company has the necessary construction funds, and this year's construction speed can be maintained.
    The first principle of the design personnel of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry in revising the design is that as long as it does not affect the production level, certain equipment and facilities can be reduced or eliminated; if there is domestically produced substitute equipment, foreign equipment will not be used. The steelmaking workshop of Daye Steel Plant originally designed a set of mechanized facilities for repairing furnaces. The design personnel suggested canceling a set of mechanized furnace repair transport equipment, a set of mud mixers, a mud pump, and several mud tanks, which would save tens of thousands of yuan in investment. The design personnel also suggested reducing some grinders in the various repair workshops of Wuhan Iron and Steel and some lathes used for the maintenance of the repair workshops themselves. Most of these reduced or eliminated equipment are for auxiliary production and backup purposes, and the reduction or elimination does not affect the production level. For a mining site of a certain factory, the original design stipulated the use of foreign-ordered wireless telephones, but now it is changed to domestically produced Fengshou brand products, which have the same effectiveness as foreign equipment, but the price is only 22% of the foreign equipment. The original design of the Wuhan Iron and Steel locomotive repair depot stipulated the use of foreign equipment 1553 vertical lathes, but now it is changed to domestically produced 153 vertical lathes, which can save more than 40,000 yuan in this single item.
    The second principle of revising the design is that the renovation of old factories must not abandon the original productivity. For example, the original design for the renovation of the Dashiqiao Magnesite Brick Factory only focused on the construction of two modern new kilns and did not seriously study the restoration of the old kilns. In this revision of the design, the design personnel studied the old kilns and believed that the old kilns were indeed not as good as the new kilns in terms of production efficiency and labor conditions, but the old kilns were existing productivity, and only a small amount of investment was needed to restore production, and the labor conditions were not so bad as to endanger production safety. Although manual labor is required, this is permissible in China's current situation of economic backwardness and large population. Therefore, they proposed to fully restore the production of old kilns. According to preliminary calculations, the restoration of old kilns only requires an investment of 3 million yuan, while building a new kiln requires more than 8.8 million yuan. The old kilns can also produce 40 tons more magnesite per year than the new kilns.
    The third principle of revising the design is to appropriately modify foreign designs according to China's specific conditions. In the past, because China did not provide complete original data for foreign designs, it was difficult for foreign design institutes to fully understand China's current economic situation and technical conditions. At the same time, the actual situation has changed greatly after several years of data submitted in the past, so some of the foreign designs are not very suitable for China's national conditions. For example, the floor of the Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 2 continuous rolling mill was originally designed to be built with granite. The design personnel proved that the granite effect was not good based on the actual production of another steel rolling mill, and this granite had to be transported from within the customs, which was very uneconomical. Now it is replaced with waste slag produced by Anshan Iron and Steel, which can save 1 million yuan in investment. For example, the foreign-designed automobile supply station of a certain factory can accommodate all 150 cars of the factory, and each car can also turn around inside, with all kinds of equipment complete. After research, the design personnel are preparing to go to the site to make modifications.

### 冶金工业部按照三项原则修改设计  既节约资金又保证生产水平和建设速度

    冶金工业部按照三项原则修改设计
    既节约资金又保证生产水平和建设速度
    本报讯　冶金工业部的设计人员，根据“勤俭建国”的方针，重新审查和修改新建、改建企业的设计图纸，在保证和提高原设计生产水平和建设速度的条件下，初步估计今年可以节约建设投资三千万元以上。今年年初，国家经济委员会平衡基本建设计划的时候，由于资金不足，曾考虑放缓包头钢铁公司的建设速度。现在，冶金工业部从设计中节约了三千万元，包头钢铁公司有了必需的建设资金，今年的建设速度就可以不放缓了。
    冶金工业部设计人员修改设计的第一条原则，就是只要不影响生产水平，某些设备和设施可削减的就削减；国内有代用设备的，就不采用国外设备。大冶钢厂的炼钢车间原来设计了一套为修炉用的机械化设施。设计人员建议取消机械化修炉运输设备一套、泥浆搅拌机一套、泥浆泵一台及几个泥浆槽，就节省投资几万元。设计人员还建议减少武钢各修理车间的部分砂轮机和为检修车间本身检修用的部分车床等。这些减少或削减的设备，大半是属于辅助生产用的和备用的，减少或削减后并不影响生产水平。某厂采矿场，原设计规定用国外订货的无线电话，现在改用国产的丰收牌产品，效能与国外设备一样，但价格只有国外设备的22％。武钢机车修理库原设计规定采用国外设备1553型立式车床，现改用国产153型立式车床，仅这一项就可节约四万余元。
    修改设计的第二条原则，就是旧厂的改建不能废弃原有的生产力。如大石桥镁砖厂的改建，原设计只致力于建设两座现代化的新窑，并没有认真去研究恢复旧窑。设计人员在这次修改设计中对旧窑进行了研究，认为旧窑在生产效率和劳动条件等方面确不如新窑好，但旧窑是已有的生产力，只需少量投资就可恢复生产，劳动条件也没有坏到危害生产安全的程度。虽然要采用手工劳动，但在我国目前经济落后和人口众多的情况下，这是允许的。所以他们提出要全部恢复旧窑生产。据初步计算，恢复旧窑只需三百万元投资，而新建一座窑需八百余万元。旧窑比新窑每年还可多产四十吨镁砂。
    修改设计的第三条原则，就是根据我国具体条件适当修改国外设计。过去，由于我国提供给国外设计的原始资料不够完整，国外设计院很难完全了解我国目前的经济情况和技术条件，同时过去提出的资料，经过几年以后实际情况有了很大变化，所以国外设计中有一些不很适合我国国情。例如鞍钢二连轧的地坪，国外设计是用花岗石砌筑，设计人员根据另一轧钢厂实际生产情况证明花岗石效果并不好，而且这种花岗石需从关内运来，很不经济，现改用鞍钢生产的废炉渣代替，可以节约一百万元投资。如国外设计的某厂汽车供应站，站内可容纳这个厂的全部汽车一百五十辆，每辆汽车还可在内转弯，各种设备俱全。设计人员研究后，准备到现场去修改。
