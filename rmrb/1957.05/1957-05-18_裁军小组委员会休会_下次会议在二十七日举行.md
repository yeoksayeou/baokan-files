Xinhua News Agency, London, May 17th: The United Nations Disarmament Commission Subcommittee decided on the 16th to adjourn again so that representatives of various countries would have the opportunity to return to their countries and study various disarmament proposals with their governments. The next meeting of the Subcommittee will be held on May 27.

Since the Soviet Union put forward a new proposal on April 30 to first implement the minimum measures of disarmament, the United States has not yet responded. The new Soviet proposal specifically moves closer to the US's insistence on the issue of "aerial inspection". US government officials also acknowledged that the proposal was a "step forward," saying that it would be carefully studied before a response could be given. Now, the US representative Stassen has already set off to return home. News reports say that the Soviet representative Zorin and the French representative Moch will also return to their countries.

    裁军小组委员会休会
    下次会议在二十七日举行
    新华社17日讯　伦敦消息：联合国裁军委员会小组委员会16日决定再次休会，以便各国代表有机会返回他们的国家，就各项裁军建议同他们的政府进行研究。小组委员会下次会议将在5月27日举行。
    自从苏联在4月30日提出首先实行裁军最低限度措施的新建议以后，美国一直还没有答复。苏联新建议里特别又在“空中视察”问题上向美国坚持的主张靠拢。美国政府人士也承认这个建议是一个“进展”，他们说，要仔细研究这个建议后才能提出答复。现在，美国代表史塔生已经启程回国。消息说，苏联代表佐林和法国代表莫克也要返国。
