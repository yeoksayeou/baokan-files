Guizhou Provincial Party Committee First Secretary
Discusses Guizhou's Rectification Study Situation

(Our correspondent Xiao Ming reports from Guiyang on the 7th of this month) To understand the progress of the rectification movement in Guizhou Province, this reporter interviewed Comrade Zhou Lin, First Secretary of the Guizhou Provincial Party Committee. His answers to the reporter's questions are as follows:

Q: The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has issued instructions on rectification. How does the Provincial Party Committee plan to proceed?

A: The Provincial Party Committee seriously studied the Central Committee's instructions at an enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee on May 3rd and formulated a preliminary plan, which is now being studied. In the rectification, it is necessary to ensure that both rectification and work are not delayed and must be carried out in stages and batches. The Provincial Party Committee's opinion is that provincial-level organs and Guiyang City should be the first stage. The prefectural and county levels are planned to be postponed until after rice transplanting. However, prefectural and county levels are required to identify the internal contradictions existing in agricultural producers' cooperatives, in conjunction with studying Chairman Mao's report, especially paying attention to ethnic issues. In addition, some urgent problems should be addressed immediately. County and district-level cadres participating in agricultural production should also be implemented immediately. If county and district party committees can pay attention to and appropriately solve the above problems, it will help to strive for a bumper agricultural harvest this year. As for the rectification movement in districts and townships, it will be postponed until this winter and next spring. In this way, the entire process of the province-wide rectification movement will take about a year and a half.

Q: What problems does the Provincial Party Committee plan to prioritize and focus on solving during the rectification movement?

A: Judging from the situation reflected in the Provincial Party Committee's propaganda work conference and the discussions of Chairman Mao's report by nearly 100,000 people from various organs, schools, and factories in Guiyang City, there are many practical problems in all aspects of work; some units can be said to be piled up with problems. These problems are mainly bureaucratism, sectarianism, and subjectivism. The relationship between the Party and the masses in certain organs, schools, and factories is extremely abnormal, and even methods of attacking and suppressing the masses are used, and the ideology of privilege is also relatively prominent. People urgently demand that the Party strengthen leadership and improve its work style. Therefore, the Provincial Party Committee believes that the first problem to be solved in the rectification is to earnestly help leading cadres overcome bureaucratism and expand democracy. This requires leading cadres to go deep into reality, understand the situation, help cadres, improve their thinking and work style, and advocate checking and improving at the same time, from the beginning of the rectification. Secondly, during the rectification, we must invite non-Party members and workers, peasants, and student masses to conduct discussions, solicit opinions, and welcome assistance at any time. In addition, sharing weal and woe with the masses and integrating with the masses is also very important. The Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Committee has decided that leading comrades from the Party, government, and military departments of the province should participate in industrial and agricultural production for a certain period of time each month, making it a system. The shortcomings that existed in these aspects by the leadership in the past are one of the reasons for the abnormal relationship between the Party and the masses and between leaders and those being led. The relationship between the Party and intellectuals is also very tense. This is mainly due to the harmful tendencies of subjectivism and sectarianism that exist in some of our comrades, which we must also treat as a priority and quickly resolve.

    贵州省委第一书记
    谈贵州开展整风学习情况
    本报贵阳7日电　本报记者肖明报道：为了了解贵州省整风运动进展的情况，记者访问了中共贵州省委第一书记周林同志。承答记者问如下：
    问：中共中央已发布了整风指示，省委准备怎么作法？
    答：省委已于5月3日常委扩大会议上认真研究了中央指示，拟定了一个初步计划，现在已经开始学习。在整风中，要做到整风和工作两不误，必须要分期分批展开。省委意见以省级机关和贵阳市为第一期。地、县级准备推迟到插秧以后。但要求地、县级结合学习毛主席报告，摸清农业生产合作社中所存在的内部矛盾的问题，尤应注意民族问题，此外，对一些迫切问题应该立即着手解决。县、区级干部参加农业生产，也要立即实行。县、区党委对上述问题如能注意并适当解决，将有助于争取今年农业的大丰收。至于区、乡的整风运动，将推迟到今冬明春。这样，全省整风运动的全部过程将是一年半左右的时间。
    问：在整风运动中，省委准备首先和重点解决那些问题？
    答：从省委召开的宣传工作会议上，以及会议以后，贵阳市的省、市各机关、学校、工厂近十万人讨论毛主席报告所反映的情况看来，在各方面工作中都存在很多实际问题；有的单位可说是问题成了堆。这些问题主要的是官僚主义、宗派主义、主观主义。某些机关、学校、工厂党与群众关系极不正常，甚至用打击压迫的方法去对待群众，特权思想也比较突出。人们迫切要求党加强领导改进作风。因此，省委认为在整风中首先要解决的问题是：认真帮助领导干部切实克服官僚主义，扩大民主。这即是要求领导干部，在整风开始的同时，就要深入实际，了解下情，帮助干部，改进思想和工作作风，提倡边检查边改进。其次，我们在整风中更要随时邀请党外人士和工人、农民、学生群众进行座谈，征求意见，欢迎帮助。此外，与群众同甘共苦，与群众打成一片也是很重要的。省委常委决定，省的党、政、军各部门领导同志每月要以一定时间，去参加工农业生产，使之形成制度。过去领导干部在这些方面所存在的毛病，是造成党与群众、领导与被领导之间关系不够正常的原因之一。还有党与知识分子的关系也显得很紧张。这主要是由于我们一些同志，存在一种有害的主观主义和宗派主义的思想倾向，这也是我们必须作为重点而迅速加以解决的问题。
