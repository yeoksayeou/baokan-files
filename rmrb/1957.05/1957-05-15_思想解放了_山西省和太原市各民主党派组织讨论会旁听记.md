Emancipated Thoughts
A Note on Observing Discussion Meetings of Democratic Parties in Shanxi Province and Taiyuan City
By our reporter He Xinghuan

Amidst the nationwide upsurge of studying and discussing Chairman Mao's speech at the Supreme State Conference, democratic parties and organizations in Shanxi Province and Taiyuan City, including the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK), the China Democratic League (CDL), the China National Democratic Construction Association (CNDCA), and the Jiusan Society, have also conveyed and discussed this significant issue of great concern to the people of the whole country: correctly handling contradictions among the people. During the discussions, many people expressed their feelings of excitement and gratitude, saying: "Chairman Mao's speech truly speaks to our hearts!" "This speech not only enriches and develops Marxism-Leninism but also has great guiding significance for our real lives." "The profoundness of the speech's content and the sincerity of its attitude are immensely encouraging!" Many people spoke out about things they had kept bottled up in their hearts for many years. Someone said: "More than seven years ago, my body was liberated, but today, my mind is truly liberated!" As a result, the discussions were lively, with people actively speaking up. Moreover, they dared to confront each other with differing opinions, sweeping away the polite and deferential atmosphere of past meetings.

Are Contradictions Among the People Related to Bureaucracy?

Under today's social system, the interests and goals of the Chinese people are consistent, and the relationships among the people are harmonious and united. Why, then, are there still contradictions? Where do contradictions among the people come from? Some people say that contradictions among the people are caused by bureaucracy. If there were no bureaucracy, there would be no contradictions. For example, last year's socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce and agricultural collectivization, although aimed at changing the private ownership of capitalists and peasants, would not have caused dissatisfaction among peasants and capitalists, nor would contradictions have arisen, if our work had been done well and without bureaucracy. Others disagreed, arguing that contradictions among the people are a reflection of the contradiction between productive forces and relations of production, and between the economic base and the superstructure, and have nothing to do with bureaucracy.

Does the occurrence of contradictions among the people have anything to do with bureaucracy? After debate, most people believed that one cannot say that contradictions among the people are caused by bureaucracy, because contradiction is an objective law of social development that does not depend on people's will. Contradictions would exist even without bureaucracy. However, one also cannot say that it has nothing to do with bureaucracy, as bureaucracy can fuel the development of contradictions. Taking last year's socialist transformation as an example, although the transformation of individual economy into collective economy and private ownership into public ownership was a necessary measure for China's social development at a certain stage, contradictions were bound to arise during this major change. However, if our work had been more meticulous and thorough, and if we had changed ownership based on raising the consciousness of the masses, there would have been fewer contradictions and the transformation would have been smoother. If we had adopted bureaucratic and administrative methods, it would have caused dissatisfaction among the people and increased contradictions between those transforming and those being transformed. Therefore, overcoming bureaucracy is a very important method for resolving contradictions among the people.

How to Understand Democracy and Freedom

Democracy and freedom are issues of concern to everyone, especially intellectuals. Therefore, when discussing the issue of contradictions among the people, it was natural to talk about them. Someone first raised the question: Now that eating and clothing are supplied according to plan, and enrollment in schools and employment are arranged in a unified way, some people feel that the state is managing too much and too rigidly, and that it is not democratic or free, and that there is no democracy or freedom like in the old society and capitalist countries. Are democracy and freedom truly more abundant in the old society and capitalist countries? Would it necessarily be better if there were more?

Regarding this issue, someone spoke about their understanding of bourgeois democracy and socialist democracy: bourgeois democracy is the democracy of the minority, which is unlimited freedom, a democracy with privileges. In order to safeguard this democracy and freedom for the minority, bourgeois countries deprive the majority of their democracy and freedom. Socialist democracy, on the other hand, belongs to the majority of the people, is guided, and does not undermine collective interests. Ultra-democracy does not conform to the interests of the people of the whole country, so it is not socialist democracy.

One professor used his own personal experience and understanding to illustrate this point. He said that in the old society and capitalist countries, "democracy" and "freedom" might have been more abundant, but that was only for the minority ruling class. These people could eat whatever they wanted and do whatever they wanted; they could even kill people if they wanted to. They enjoyed full democracy and freedom. However, for the majority of the people, they could not enjoy this kind of democracy and freedom. They only had the freedom to be oppressed and exploited, to be unable to eat or dress adequately. Many people were deprived of the basic democratic right to vote because of their skin color, money, origin, religious beliefs, etc. Take us teachers, for example. In the old society, it was indeed free to find a job, but at the end of each semester, we worried about where we would be next semester. I think it is better to have less of this kind of "freedom." What kind of democracy and freedom is it if one speaks of democracy and freedom, but the majority of people cannot enjoy it? I fully support Chairman Mao's statement that democracy is both a means and an end. Improving the people's lives so that everyone lives well is the broadest democracy and freedom.

The professor's heartfelt words resonated with many people.

How to Supervise

Chairman Mao once again put forward the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" at the Supreme State Conference, which made democratic parties and organizations in Shanxi Province universally feel that their "responsibility has increased." But how should the policy of mutual supervision be implemented? Some people said that supervision can only be carried out through organizations, and individual members of democratic parties cannot supervise the leadership party because their own political level is low and they have no capital. Others disagreed, arguing that a low level can be improved through learning, and as long as one stands firmly on the people's position, maintains close ties with the masses, and cares about national affairs and the problems of one's own unit, one has the capital to make criticisms and suggestions to the leadership party. The majority opinion was that supervision can be carried out through organizations, as well as individually. Democratic parties should not only supervise the leadership party but also accept the leadership of the Communist Party and strive for the party's supervision of themselves.

How can we better play the role of supervision? Everyone believes that first, we should transform our old thoughts and old consciousness so that our ideology matches our social status today. We should not simply sing praises to the party, but adopt a spirit of responsibility to the cause of socialism, promptly reflect the opinions and demands of the masses, actively make criticisms and suggestions to the party, assist the party in doing its work, and handle problems well. For some Communist Party members who are unwilling to accept the opinions of others, we should not adopt an antagonistic attitude. Since we are friends, we should treat each other with sincerity and help them patiently.

We Must Not Use "Inevitable Theory" as a Shield

Chairman Mao said that when looking at problems, we should use the "two-point theory" instead of the "one-point theory." We should see both the advantages and the disadvantages. Affirming everything and negating everything are both incorrect. This issue sparked quite a heated debate in the discussions.

Some people said that if a piece of work is said to have basic achievements and inevitable shortcomings or errors, isn't that a confusion of right and wrong? There were doubts about the "two-point theory."

Some people said that achievements and shortcomings are opposing, but also unified. Affirming achievements is to learn from experience, and seeing shortcomings is to learn lessons. Both are to improve work. Making correct estimates of achievements and shortcomings is in line with objective reality and is not a confusion of right and wrong. Saying that shortcomings and errors are inevitable does not mean that we can fail to eliminate errors or overcome shortcomings.

Some people said that I agree with the statement that "achievements are basic and errors are inevitable" on a national scale, but we cannot say this in some specific issues, especially for some people, because some shortcomings and errors are not inevitable, but are caused by bureaucracy. Some people are now using the phrase "errors are inevitable" as a shield, and are not actively trying to overcome the shortcomings in their work. For example, the matter of queuing to buy things, some of which are indeed inevitable, but why do some places in Taiyuan City, which is very close to the coal mines, have to queue in long lines to buy coal? Is this also inevitable?

After debate, opinions gradually converged. Everyone believes that it is necessary to affirm the achievements and shortcomings in our work truthfully. The "two-point theory" is completely correct. Without it, we cannot continue to move forward. However, we must warn and supervise those "inevitability theorists" who attempt to use the phrase "errors are inevitable" as a shield, and urge them to eliminate errors, overcome shortcomings, and improve their work.

    思想解放了
    山西省和太原市各民主党派组织讨论会旁听记	本报记者　何星环
    在全国各地普遍学习、讨论毛主席在最高国务会议上的讲话的热潮中，山西省和太原市的民革、民盟、民建和九三学社等民主党派组织，对正确处理人民内部矛盾这个举国人民关心的重大问题，也进行了传达和讨论。在讨论中，许多人怀着又兴奋、又感激的心情说：“毛主席的这次讲话，真是说到我们心里去了！”“这次讲话是既丰富发展了马克思列宁主义，又对我们的现实生活具有伟大的指导意义。”“讲话内容的深刻，态度的诚恳，给人以莫大鼓舞！”许多人说出了憋在心里多年来不敢说的话。有人说： “七年多以前我的身体解放了，今天，我的思想才真正解放！”因此，讨论时气氛很热烈，发言的也很踊跃，而且相互之间有不同意见也敢于交锋，一扫过去开会时那种客客气气的风气。
    人民内部矛盾究竟和官僚主义有关无关
    在今天的社会制度下，我国人民的利益和目标是一致的，人民之间的关系也是和睦团结的，为什么还会有矛盾？人民内部的矛盾从那里来的？有人说，人民内部矛盾是官僚主义造成的，如果没有官僚主义，就不会有矛盾。比如去年的资本主义工商业改造和农业合作化，虽然是要改变资本家和农民的私人所有制，但是如果我们工作做得好，没有官僚主义，就不会引起农民和资本家的不满，就不会发生矛盾。有人不同意这种看法，认为人民内部矛盾是生产力和生产关系的矛盾、经济基础和上层建筑的矛盾的反映，根本与官僚主义无关。
    人民内部矛盾的发生究竟与官僚主义有没有关系呢？经过争论以后，大多数人认为：不能说人民内部矛盾是官僚主义造成的，因为矛盾是社会发展的客观规律，是不以人们的意志为转移的，没有官僚主义，也会存在矛盾。但是，也不能说与官僚主义根本无关，官僚主义可以助长矛盾的发展。仍以去年的社会主义改造为例，虽然个体经济改变成集体经济、私有制改变成公有制，是我国社会发展到一定阶段必然要采取的措施，在这种大变动中，也必然会发生矛盾。但是，如果我们的工作做得细致一些、深入一些，在提高了群众觉悟程度的基础上来改变所有制，矛盾就会少一些，改造也会顺利一些；如果我们采取官僚主义行政命令的作法，就会引起人民的不满，增加改造者和被改造者之间的矛盾。所以，克服官僚主义是解决人民内部矛盾的一个很重要的方法。
    怎样认识民主和自由
    民主和自由，是大家特别是知识分子所关心的问题，因此，在讨论人民内部矛盾问题的时候，很自然地就谈到了它。有人首先提出问题说：现在吃饭、穿衣要按计划供应，升学、就业要统一安排，有人就认为国家管得太多太死，不民主不自由，没有旧社会和资本主义国家民主自由。旧社会和资本主义国家的民主和自由是不是真正多些？多些是不是一定就好？
    对于这个问题，有人在发言中谈到了自己对资产阶级民主和社会主义民主的认识：资产阶级民主是少数人的民主，是无限自由的、有特权的民主。资产阶级国家为了保障少数人的这种民主和自由，就剥夺了大多数人的民主和自由。社会主义民主则是属于大多数人民的、有领导的、不破坏集体利益的民主。极端民主化不符合全国人民的利益，因此它不是社会主义民主。
    有一位教授更用自己的亲身经历和体会作了说明。他说，在旧社会和资本主义国家，可能“民主”和“自由”是要多些，但那是对少数统治阶级而言。这一部分人想吃什么就吃什么，想做什么就做什么，甚至想杀人就可以杀人，他们享有充分的民主和自由。但是，对于大多数人民来说，则享受不到这种民主和自由。他们只有被压迫被剥削、吃不饱穿不暖的自由，很多人因为肤色、金钱、出身、宗教信仰等被剥夺了选举这个起码的民主权利。拿我们教书的人来说吧，在旧社会找职业确实是自由，但是，每到学期终了就发愁，不知下学期又身在何处。像这样的“自由”，我以为还是少一些的好。嘴上说民主和自由，但是大多数人享受不到，这叫什么民主和自由？我十分拥护毛主席说民主是手段，也是目的的话，改善人民生活，使每个人都生活得很好，才是最广泛的民主和自由。
    这位教授的肺腑之言，在许多人的心里引起了共鸣。
    怎样监督
    毛主席在最高国务会议上又一次提出“长期共存，互相监督”的方针，使山西省各民主党派组织普遍感到“责任重了”，但是应该怎样来贯彻互相监督的方针呢？有人说，监督只能通过组织来进行，民主党派的成员个人是无法对领导党实行监督的。因为自己政治水平低，没有本钱。有人不同意这种说法，认为水平低可以通过学习提高自己，只要自己站稳人民的立场，密切联系群众，关心国家大事和本单位的问题，就有本钱向领导党提出批评和建议。大多数人的意见是：监督可以通过组织，也可以通过个人。民主党派不但应该监督领导党，而且应该接受共产党的领导，争取党对自己的监督。
    怎样才能够较好地发挥监督作用呢？大家认为：首先应该改造自己的旧思想旧意识，使自己的思想意识和今天的社会地位相称起来，不要对党一片歌功颂德，要拿出对社会主义事业负责的精神来，及时地反映群众的意见和要求，积极地向党提出批评和建议，协助党做好工作，处理好问题。对于某些不愿意接受别人意见的共产党员，也不要采取对立的态度，因为既然是朋友，就应该以诚相见、耐心帮助。
    不能拿“难免论”做挡箭牌
    毛主席说看问题应该“两点论”，不要“一点论”，既要看到优点，也要看到缺点，肯定一切和否定一切都是不对的。这个问题，在讨论中引起了相当激烈的争论。
    有人说，如果一件工作说它成绩是基本的，缺点或错误是难免的，那不是是非不分了吗？对“两点论”有怀疑。
    有人说，成绩和缺点是对立的，但又是统一的，肯定成绩是为了吸取经验，看到缺点是为了接受教训，都是为了改进工作。对成绩和缺点作正确的估计才合乎客观实际，并不是是非不分；说缺点、错误是难免的，并不是说就可以不消灭错误、克服缺点。
    有人说，在全国范围内说“成绩是基本的，错误是难免的”我同意，但是在有些具体问题上特别是对某些人不能这样说。因为有些缺点、错误并不是难免的，而是官僚主义造成的。现在有些人已经把 “错误是难免的”这句话作为挡箭牌了，不积极设法克服自己工作中的缺点。比如买东西排队这件事，有些确实是难免的，但是为什么在煤矿近在咫尺的太原市，有的地方买煤也要排着长长的队呢？这难道也是难免的吗？
    经过争论，意见逐渐趋于一致，大家认为：实事求是地肯定我们工作中的成绩和缺点是必要的，“两点论”是完全正确的，不这样，就不能继续前进。但是对于那些企图把“错误是难免的”这句话拿来做挡箭牌的“难免论”者，我们要提出警告，进行监督，促使他们消灭错误，克服缺点，改进工作。
