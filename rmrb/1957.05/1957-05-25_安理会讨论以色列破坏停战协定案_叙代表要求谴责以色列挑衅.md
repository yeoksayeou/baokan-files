Xinhua News Agency, New York, 24th -- TASS, New York, 23rd: The Security Council began discussing on the 23rd a complaint filed by Syria regarding Israel's violation of the armistice agreement. The Syrian representative suggested that the Security Council condemn this Israeli behavior.

The Syrian representative, Mr. Asha, spoke first at the meeting. He pointed out that the Israeli authorities had begun to build military bridges and construct various fortifications in the demilitarized zone, violating the armistice agreement between Syria and Israel. Israeli police forces and troops are also stationed in the demilitarized zone, and landmines have been buried on the roads leading to the bridges.

The acting Chief of Staff of the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization admitted that the construction of bridges in the demilitarized zone would undoubtedly provide military convenience to Israel, which is fundamentally prohibited by the armistice agreement. However, he also agreed with the Israeli side's claim that this construction project is economic in nature.

Asha expressed surprise at this attitude. He emphasized that this person's conclusion that Israel's actions do not violate the armistice agreement is dangerous and will have unpleasant consequences and encourage Israel to further violate the armistice agreement.

The Israeli representative, Mr. Kidron, spoke at the meeting. He denied Israel's obvious violations of the armistice agreement and the principles of the Security Council. The Security Council will continue to discuss the Syrian complaint on May 28.

    安理会讨论以色列破坏停战协定案
    叙代表要求谴责以色列挑衅
    据新华社24日讯　塔斯社纽约23日讯：安全理事会23日开始讨论叙利亚提出的关于以色列破坏停战协定的控诉案。叙利亚代表建议安理会谴责以色列的这种行为。
    叙利亚代表亚沙首先在会上发言。他指出，以色列当局已经开始在非军事区内建造军用桥梁，修筑各种各样的工事，破坏叙利亚和以色列的停战协定。以色列的警察部队和军队还驻扎在非军事区内，而且在通往桥梁的路上还埋了地雷。
    联合国停战监督参谋部代理参谋长承认：在非军事区修建桥梁无疑会给以色列军事上的便利，这是停战协定根本禁止的。然而，他又同意以色列方面的这种说法：这个建筑工程是经济性质的。
    亚沙对于这种态度表示惊奇。他强调指出，这个人所说的关于以色列的行动并不违背停战协定的结论是危险的，而且会造成令人不愉快的后果和鼓励以色列进一步破坏停战协定。
    以色列代表基德隆在会上发言。他否认以色列显然破坏停战协定和安理会原则的行为。安理会在5月28日将继续讨论叙利亚的控诉案。
