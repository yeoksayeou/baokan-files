The Enlarged Meeting of the Central Committee Small Group of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang Continues
Differing Views on the Issue of Unleashing Criticism

    (Our dispatch) The enlarged meeting of the Central Committee Small Group of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang continued on the morning of the 29th. More than 30 people, including Vice Chairmen, Central Standing Committee members, and Central Committee members attended the meeting. The meeting was presided over by Zhu Yunshan, Minister of the Organization Department of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang.

    Li Pingheng stated in his speech that he could not agree with the following attitudes that have recently emerged in helping the Communist Party with rectification: some people spread rumors and used bureaucracy to rectify bureaucracy; some people spoke for the sake of speaking; and some people spoke with the attitude of venting their anger. These do not conform to the spirit of sincerity, frankness, gentleness, and mildness.

    When talking about the issue of walls and ditches between the Communist Party and non-Party people, he said that there are two types of walls: tangible and intangible. Tangible walls are issues of systems and habits. Intangible walls are formed by psychological and mental factors. Some non-Party people are timid and constrained because they are not Party members and are unwilling to approach Party members. When they meet on the road, they "detour" from afar, and "lower their heads and pass by" when they are near. Therefore, Party members should take the initiative to tear down the walls, and non-Party people should also tear them down. The way to tear them down should be "more contact and more heart-to-heart talks." Some Party meetings should allow non-Party people to participate as much as possible. He also suggested that the remaining issues from the "Three Antis" and "Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries" campaigns should be resolved as soon as possible.

    Chen Mingde first talked about the problem of the United Front Work Department "uniting the top but not the bottom." He believes that it is impossible for the United Front Work Department to contact all members of the democratic parties. The only people they frequently contact are the upper-level figures. Therefore, uniting the top is for the sake of uniting the bottom, because these upper-level figures are representatives of a certain aspect of the lower levels. Some upper-level figures in the democratic parties are there because they made contributions to the revolution in the past and have certain talents and learning; others are representative of their class. The United Front Work Department's contact with them is not just to unite them personally, but to unite the aspect they represent. Therefore, the United Front Work Department should first select those who are representative and strengthen their education on mass viewpoints so that they can connect well with the masses they represent. Some upper-level democratic figures have become estranged from the masses after taking leadership positions. This is worth noting. At the same time, he believes that the circle of the United Front Work Department in the past was too small. For example, the symposiums recently convened by the United Front Work Department always involved the same few leading figures. Some non-leading figures had other opinions but had no opportunity to participate. Therefore, he hopes that the circle will be larger in the future and that more meetings will be held.

    When talking about the relationship between Party members and non-Party members in state organs, he said that non-Party people who participate in work are state cadres and have a working relationship with Party members. However, some Party members always regard them as targets of the United Front, providing care everywhere, which is one of the important reasons why non-Party people have positions but no power.

    When talking about the issue of "letting go" and "reining in," Chen Mingde said that only the upper levels have been mobilized so far, and the lower levels are still observing the situation as "observers" and still have concerns. Regarding certain criticisms of the Communist Party, some people have recently expressed different views, and newspapers have published these views. Chen Mingde believes that this is a "trend of reining in." He said that letting go means fully exposing contradictions, while reining in can only cover up contradictions, and even lead to a situation where "things get out of control." Therefore, those who truly love the Party should speak out and allow others to speak out as well.

    Li Zheng expressed in his speech that he had recently seen a bad atmosphere in the newspapers, where people were arbitrarily labeled and rebutted. He said that the newspapers should also be responsible. He said that our speeches must reflect the true situation and real contradictions, and we should not replace the general with our own personal experiences.

    Lu Yuwen said that he could not agree with the opinions of Tan Tiwu at the meeting on the 25th and Li Zheng at today's meeting. He said that it is appropriate to offer opinions to the leading party, and it is also appropriate to express different views on these opinions. Whether these views are correct or not can be studied. However, it cannot be said that this is to rein in or suppress the voicing of opinions. Why is it only permissible to criticize the Communist Party and not to criticize the critics? This is unfair. He said that, in general, there are walls and ditches between the Party and non-Party people. However, specifically speaking, there are also those without walls and ditches. Why is it that everyone is only happy when there are walls and ditches? He believes that such an atmosphere should not be fostered, where only the leading party can be criticized and not the democratic parties. When talking about how to tear down walls and fill ditches, he pointed out that this should be a two-way effort. The Communist Party should tear down the "three isms"; the democratic parties and democratic figures should tear down old thoughts, old habits, and old work styles, abandon their past positions, and firmly establish a people's stance. Without this, the Communist Party alone cannot tear down the walls. For example, if someone demands a fixed interest rate for twenty years, how can the walls be torn down? After the walls are torn down and the ditches are filled, democratic figures and industrialists and businessmen should further unite around the Communist Party to build socialism together. This is the direction.

    In his speech, Qin Yizhi also believed that some of the recent newspaper headlines had "a taste of reining in," and the People's Daily headlines were worth studying. In his view, the fact that some activists expressed "concern" for the leading party was also a manifestation of "reining in."

    In his speech, Long Yun expressed dissatisfaction with the report in this newspaper on the 24th of his speech at the enlarged meeting of the Central Committee Small Group of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang on the 22nd; however, he did not cite specific facts.

    Long Yun also believed that Li Zhonggong was "using old work styles to criticize others."

    Tan Tiwu said that the problem of helping the Communist Party with rectification has now gone astray. She said that when cutting out the malignant tumors of the "three evils," some poisonous weeds did appear. She opposes opinions such as fixing the interest rate for twenty years, not having public representatives, and abolishing the党委制 in universities. However, she also opposes harming the Party from the other side. She said that helping the Communist Party with rectification is to expose contradictions, to sound the alarm, and to wake up some Party members. She believes that Lu Yuwen is speaking on behalf of Communist Party members who resist rectification. He has not said a word that is helpful to the Party, which is a manifestation of disloyalty to the Party and the country. She said that Chairman Mao had already taught Communist Party members to care for non-Party cadres, to value intellectuals, and to appoint people on their merits in articles such as "The Position of the Chinese Communist Party in the National War" eighteen or nineteen years ago.... However, many shortcomings in current work show that many Communist Party members have not acted in accordance with Chairman Mao's words. She believes that these Party members are disloyal to the Party. Therefore, she wants to ask those Communist Party members who resist Chairman Mao's instructions: "Why don't you listen to Chairman Mao's words? Why do you resist?" She demands that these Party members make a deep self-criticism.

    Mei Gongbin expressed the following about the debate between Tan Tiwu and Lu Yuwen: Offering opinions to the CCP is to help the CCP with rectification. Any opinions can be offered, whether they are positive or negative. This is what is called contention.

    Wan Baobang and Xu Wentian also spoke at the meeting.

### 民革中央小组扩大会议继续举行  对于放手开展批评问题有不同看法

    民革中央小组扩大会议继续举行
    对于放手开展批评问题有不同看法
    本报讯　中国国民党革命委员会中央小组扩大会议29日上午继续举行。到会副主席、中央常委、中央委员三十多人。会议由民革中央组织部长朱蕴山主持。
    李平衡在发言中首先说明，他不能同意最近在帮助共产党整风中出现的这样几种态度：有人道听途说，以官僚主义整官僚主义；有人是为发言而发言；也有人是以出气态度发言。这都不符合真诚坦率，和风细雨的精神。
    在谈到共产党和党外人士之间的墙沟问题的时候，他说墙有有形的和无形的两种。有形的墙是制度和习惯问题。无形的墙是心理作用和精神作用形成的。有些党外人士，因为自己不是党员而束手束脚、局局促促，同党员不愿接近。在路上遇见，远则“绕道而行”，近则“低头而过”。因此，党员固然应该主动动手拆墙，党外人士也应该动手拆。拆的办法应该是“多接触、多谈心”，有些党的会议，可以让党外人士参加的应该尽量让大家参加。他并且建议，要尽快解决“三反”、“肃反”中的遗留问题。
    陈铭德在发言中首先谈了统战部统上不统下的问题。他认为要统战部接触民主党派所有的成员是不可能的，经常接触的只能是上层人物。因此统上就是为了统下。因为这些上层是下边某一方面的代表人物。民主党派中的上层人物，有的是因为过去对革命有贡献，有一定的才学；有的是在他那个阶层中有代表性。统战部同他们接触并不是仅仅统他们个人，而是为了统他们所代表的那个方面。因此，统战部首先应该选择那些有代表性的人物，并且要加强对他们的群众观点的教育，使他们好好联系所代表的群众。有个别上层民主人士，在居于领导地位之后，对群众反而疏远了。这是值得注意的。同时，他认为过去统战部划的统战圈子太小，如最近统战部召开的座谈会，谈来谈去，总是那几个首脑人物。一些非首脑人物虽然另有意见，却没有机会参加。因此，他希望今后圈子要划大些，会要多开一些。
    在谈到国家机关中的党与非党的关系时，他说，党外人士参加了工作，就是国家干部，与党员就是共事关系。但是有些党员，却总是把他们看成是统战对象，处处照顾，这是党外人士有职无权的重要原因之一。
    陈铭德在谈到放和收的问题时说，现在只是上层动了，下层还在以“观察员”的身份观察气候，仍有顾虑。对共产党的某些批评，最近有些人发表了不同的看法，报纸上发表了这些看法，陈铭德认为这就是一种“收的趋势”。他说，放是充分揭露矛盾，收只能掩盖矛盾，乃至“一发而不可收拾。”因此，真正爱护党的，就应该鸣，也让别人鸣。
    李蒸在发言中表示，最近他从报纸上看到了一种不好的气氛，随便扣帽子，随便打回去。他说，报馆也应该负责。他说，我们的发言一定要反映真实情况，真正矛盾，不要把自己的亲身经历，代替了一般。
    卢郁文说：他不能同意25日会上谭惕吾和今天会上李蒸的意见。他说，给领导党提意见是应当的，对这些意见表示不同的看法，也是应当的。这些看法对不对，可以研究。但是不能说这就是要收，是压迫鸣放。为什么只许批评共产党，而不许批评批评者呢？不公平。他说，总的来说，党和非党之间有墙有沟。但是具体的讲，也有没墙没沟的，怎么非说有墙有沟才开心呢？他认为不能养成这样一种风气，只能批评领导党，不能批评民主人士。在谈到如何拆墙填沟的时候，他指出，这应该是两方面的事。共产党应该拆的是三个主义；民主党派和民主人士要拆的是旧思想、旧习惯、旧作风，要放弃过去的立场，要坚定地树立人民立场。不这样，单是共产党拆墙，是拆不了的。如有人要求二十年定息，墙怎能拆的了呢？拆墙填沟以后，应该是民主人士、工商业者进一步团结在共产党的周围，一起建设社会主义，这才是方向。
    覃异之在谈话中也认为，最近报纸上的一些标题，有“收的味道”，人民日报的标题就值得研究。在他看来，某些积极分子为领导党表露了一种“担心”，也是“收”的表现。
    龙云在发言中，对本报24日发表的他在22日民革中央小组扩大会议上的发言，表示不满；但是他没有举出具体事实。
    龙云还认为李仲公是“用旧作风批评别人”。
    谭惕吾发言说，在帮助共产党整风的问题上，现在出了岔道。她说，在割治三害毒瘤的时候，确实出现了一些毒草。关于定息二十年，不要公方代表，取消高等学校的党委制等意见，她是反对的。但是，她也反对从另一方面损害党。她说，帮助共产党整风，就是要揭露矛盾，就是要敲警钟，把一些党员敲醒。她认为卢郁文是在代表抗拒整风的共产党员说话，他没有一句话是对党有帮助的，这是对党不实、对国不忠的表现。她说，毛主席早在十八九年以前，在“中国共产党在民族战争中的地位”等等的文章里面，就教导共产党员要关心非党干部，要重视知识分子，要任人唯贤……。但是，现在工作中的很多缺点，都说明很多共产党员并没有按照毛主席的话办事。她认为这些党员是对党不忠实的。因此，她要问问那些抗拒毛主席的指示的共产党员：“你们为什么不听毛主席的话，为什么抗拒？”她要求这些党员作深刻检查。
    梅龚彬对谭惕吾和卢郁文的争论，作了这样的表示：对中共提意见，是为了帮助中共整风。什么意见都可以提，不论是正面的，或者反面的，都可以提。这才叫作争鸣。
    在会上发言的人还有万保邦、许闻天。
