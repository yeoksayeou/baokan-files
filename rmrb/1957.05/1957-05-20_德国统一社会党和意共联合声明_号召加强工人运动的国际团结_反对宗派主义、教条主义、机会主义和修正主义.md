Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 19th. The German News Agency reported on the 18th that a joint statement was issued after talks in Berlin from May 9th to 14th between a delegation from the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, headed by First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, Walter Ulbricht, and a delegation from the Italian Communist Party, headed by member of the leadership of the Italian Communist Party, Umberto Terracini.

The statement addressed important international issues. It pointed out that the revival of West German militarism is a direct danger threatening world peace. One of the main factors contributing to the tension in the international situation is the growing threat of atomic warfare. Therefore, the two parties call on the working people of the world to wage a resolute struggle to halt the testing of all atomic and hydrogen weapons and to abandon the production and use of atomic and hydrogen weapons.

The two parties call for further strengthening the international solidarity of the workers' movement. They stated that they should comprehensively develop and strengthen ties with the masses based on the principles and doctrines of Marxism-Leninism, and should strive to adapt their political actions to the economic and historical conditions of their respective countries. They emphasized that in order for the working class to become the leading class, and to be able to express the interests of the entire nation, communist and workers' parties must be educated in the spirit of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, and must absorb the experiences of all countries, especially the experience of the Soviet Union.

Finally, the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and the Italian Communist Party declared that they will resolutely wage an uncompromising struggle against sectarianism, dogmatism, and other forms of left-leaning opportunism, and against any form of revisionism, because revisionism may lead to the negation of the leading role of the working class in the struggle for democracy and socialism, thereby leading to division and surrender.

    德国统一社会党和意共联合声明
    号召加强工人运动的国际团结
    反对宗派主义、教条主义、机会主义和修正主义
    新华社柏林19日电　德意志通讯社18日发表了以德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记乌布利希为首的德国统一社会党代表团和以意大利共产党领导机构成员斯巴诺为首的意大利共产党代表团会谈后的联合声明，这次会谈是在5月9日到14日在柏林举行的。
    声明谈到了重要的国际问题。它指出，西德军国主义的复活是威胁世界和平的直接危险。使国际局势趋于紧张的主要因素之一是日益增长的原子战争的威胁。因此，两党号召全世界劳动人民进行坚决斗争，争取停止试验一切原子武器和氢武器，争取放弃生产和使用原子武器和氢武器。
    两党号召进一步加强工人运动的国际团结。它们表示，要根据马克思列宁主义的原则和学说，全面地发展和加强同群众的联系，并且要竭力使它们的政治行动同本国的经济和历史情况相配合。它们强调，要使工人阶级成为领导阶级，要使它能够表达全民族利益，共产党和工人党就必须受马克思列宁主义以及无产阶级国际主义精神的教育，就必须吸收各国的经验，特别是苏联的经验。
    最后，德国统一社会党和意大利共产党声明：它们要坚决进行不妥协的斗争，反对宗派主义、教条主义以及其他各种形式的左倾机会主义，并且反对任何形式的修正主义，因为修正主义可能导致否定工人阶级在争取民主和社会主义的斗争中的领导作用，从而导致分裂和投降。
