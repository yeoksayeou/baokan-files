    From a Higher Primary School Graduate to a Cooperative Farm Feeder: The Story of Feng Jian's Participation in Agricultural Labor
    When Feng Jian bid farewell to the people of her hometown who were celebrating her departure with gongs and drums, and came to Beijing once again to participate in the Third National Congress of the Communist Youth League, she felt so cheerful and excited all the way, looking at the surging waves of the Xiang River outside the cabin, and the endless fields stretching outside the train window! She felt as if she was tightly integrated with our entire country and with all of our people. Recalling those nights more than three years ago when she cried about her future, it was like being lost in a dark forest, with all kinds of personal worries and pursuits blinding her eyes, preventing her from seeing the correct path in life. But once she freed herself from those personal pursuits and devoted herself selflessly to the collective cause of the people, it was as if she had obtained a golden key from a fairy tale, and a new world immediately unfolded before her...
      Determined to Stay in Her Hometown
    In 1953, during the summer when Feng Jian graduated from higher primary school and failed to get into middle school, how many nights did she cry! She was not only afraid to see relatives and classmates, but even afraid to go to the streets of Changsha—seeing the bustling crowds on the street, she would blush with shame, as if everyone knew her and knew that she had not been admitted to middle school. She left her father, who worked as an accountant in a Changsha store, and returned to her hometown on the banks of the Xiang River. In her hometown, her pain could not be alleviated. She secluded herself in a wooden building upstairs and would not come down. Her mother had to bring her food up, but she could not swallow it. What was even more terrifying were those sleepless nights. The more she thought about it, the more she felt there was no way out, and she was almost going crazy.
    At this time, the township was preparing to establish a primary cooperative. Comrade Li Du from the county work team, Comrade Wu Yinqin, the Party branch secretary, and Comrade Wu Chundie, a Party member, all came to persuade Feng Jian, telling her about the brilliant prospects of the countryside, and asking her to stay in the cooperative as the accountant of the credit cooperative. Feng Jian verbally agreed, but in her heart, she was very disgusted. She firmly believed that the rural areas would be as beautiful as the Soviet countryside in the future after the implementation of cooperation, and she had even dreamed of becoming a tractor driver when she was in elementary school. But now, what tractors could be found in the countryside! How many years would it take to be like the Soviet Union?
    The Party branch and the Communist Youth League branch continued to educate Feng Jian, and finally, the deeds of Xu Jianchun touched her heart. Xu Jianchun, like her, was a higher primary school graduate, a teenage girl. If she could participate in rural production labor and make such contributions, why couldn't she?
    Feng Jian agreed to be the accountant of the credit cooperative. But at this time, her mother was still asking people to inquire about any factories outside that were recruiting workers, and she herself was holding the idea of ​​just doing it temporarily. Also, because she was worried that she would not be able to leave if she had the opportunity to go out in the future, she was careless about her work, thinking that as long as the accounts were correct. But work cannot be careless, and soon, errors occurred in the accounts! In one settlement, there was a difference of ten yuan, and she couldn't reconcile it no matter what. Feng Jian, who was only fifteen years old, was terrified—what if others found out and said she was embezzling? She was secretly anxious for a long time, and finally, trembling with fear, she told Wu Chundie, the Party member who treated her like a granddaughter. Much to Feng Jian's surprise, Wu Chundie not only did not blame her, but also found a bank teller to help her check the accounts for several nights, and the ten yuan was found. This deeply moved Feng Jian's young mind. With a feeling of guilt and gratitude to the comrades who cared for her like relatives, she was determined to do a good job as the accountant of the credit cooperative, and to stay in this hometown where she felt warmth everywhere.
    Fell in Love with Agricultural Labor
    Feng Jian did accounting work at night and participated in production during the day. Her first labor was to repair the embankment. That day, when she came to the embankment and saw that there were no women at all, she felt a little timid. When she picked up the earth basket and walked back and forth on the gravel road, the soles of her feet hurt so much that she panicked. Moreover, if she carried too much, her back would be straightened, and if she carried too little, she was afraid that others would laugh at her. She endured it for a morning, and rested at home in the afternoon. In the evening, Wu Chundie came and said to Feng Jian: "The beginning is difficult, take it slow, don't be afraid!" Hearing this, Feng Jian suddenly thought of her red scarf. When she was the captain of the Young Pioneers in school, the red scarf had encouraged her to overcome many difficulties! The next day, she mustered up her energy and went to the embankment again, finally earning more than sixty work points, and leading forty or fifty women to participate in the embankment repair project.
    This first round on the labor front made Feng Jian understand an important secret—persistence leads to victory. This winter, the cooperative launched a manure accumulation campaign. In the freezing weather, Feng Jian and the male comrades rolled up their trouser legs and went into the pond to dig pond mud. The male comrades kindly dissuaded her, but she thought: "If others can do it, why can't I? You can't be afraid of hardship in labor!" In this way, Feng Jian—the only unmarried girl, together with the male farmers, stood in the knee-deep pond mud that was frozen to the bone, and shoveled, shoveling, dedicating her strength to the great labor of building socialism.
    Since then, Feng Jian aroused people's love, and she began to humbly learn all kinds of work in the fields. Plowing the fields has always been a farm job that only experienced old farmers could do, but she faced the cold wind of winter, with mud all over her face and body, and came and went in the paddy fields, day after day, and finally learned to plow. In this way, Feng Jian used her practical actions to elevate herself to the ranks of advanced youth. In March 1954, the Communist Youth League branch admitted her to the Communist Youth League. At the swearing-in ceremony, Comrade Wu Yinqin, the Party branch secretary, gave an enthusiastic explanation of the oath "to fight for the defense of the motherland and the realization of a socialist society." This oath remained in Feng Jian's heart like a spark. Since then, she has indeed lived up to the glorious title of "Communist Youth League member." In the production of this year, she took the lead in everything, such as leading everyone to replant rape seedlings, promoting the planting of sweet potatoes and double-cropping rice, promoting saline selection, and creating the experience of three catties of rice seed per mu, and experimenting with hybridization to cultivate new varieties of rice.
     In Times of Crisis
    Like many girls, Feng Jian was afraid of ghosts, afraid of walking dark roads, and even afraid of falling into the pond water when passing by the edge of the pond. In the autumn of 1954, the Xiang River flooded during the heavy rains that were rare in the southern provinces for many years. On that night, the sound of the wind and thunder shook the world. With the light of the lightning, Feng Jian ran to the embankment with everyone, and she forgot her fear. When she got to the embankment, she was soaked all over. The male comrades all advised her to go back, but how could she be willing to go back? At a time when the lives and property of the people were in imminent danger, how could she—a member of the Communist Youth League—ignore it! When cracks appeared on the embankment, and the waves surged into the fields, many people were frightened and retreated from the embankment, hiding in the paddy fields, at a loss. At this critical moment, Feng Jian thought of Liu Hulan! Liu Hulan was not afraid of the enemy's guillotine, so could she be afraid of the flood? Thinking this way, Feng Jian immediately felt full of courage. She jumped into the water with a plop. After a moment of stunned silence, the young men also jumped into the water one after another. Everyone pulled up the rice seedlings and finally plugged the cracks. In this way, Feng Jian stayed on the embankment for three days and three nights without going home until the flood subsided slightly and the village was out of danger.
    After this rescue, in everyone's mind, Feng Jian was not only lovely and approachable, but also admirable and respectable. Everyone had a respect and trust for this little girl that was disproportionate to her age. After the autumn expansion of the cooperative, she was elected as the vice-chairman of the Xitang Agricultural Cooperative. In 1955, she was also elected as the cooperative's labor model and attended the provincial and national conferences of youth socialist construction activists.
    When Feng Jian unexpectedly saw Chairman Mao at the meeting in Beijing, she couldn't help but burst into tears. On the way back, she always thought about applying to join the Party, thinking that when she turned eighteen, she must stand in the ranks of the Party, so that she would not be ashamed of Chairman Mao!
    Feng Jian did not disappoint Chairman Mao. She continued to test herself in every specific job and labor. In the spring of 1956, before she was even eighteen years old, she solemnly read the oath of a Communist Party member in front of Chairman Mao's portrait, again with tears in her eyes.
    Don't Be an Accountant, Be a Feeder
    In the spring of 1956, when the cooperative planned to assign dozens of young people who had recently left school as feeders, several girls cried sadly. At this time, Feng Jian, who was the accountant of the entire cooperative, applied to the cooperative committee to also be a feeder, but this application was not approved by the cooperative committee.
    One day, Feng Jian went to the breeding farm to see Liu Xia and Wang Ailian to understand what difficulties they had. These two girls didn't even look at Feng Jian and said coldly: "We don't have any difficulties! We're fine here!" Hearing this, and seeing their tired, annoyed, and unbearable expressions, Feng Jian understood everything. Feng Jian squatted down and helped them cut feed, saying: "Take it slow, no matter what job, the beginning is always difficult..." "It doesn't matter if it's difficult or not," Liu Xia replied with thorns in her words, "who will feed the pigs if we, who have no culture and no ability, don't come to feed the pigs?" Wang Ailian immediately continued: "People want to be full-time cadres! People say they want to be feeders, but they just want to take the lead and deceive us stupid bags!" Hearing this, Feng Jian didn't say a word, left the breeding farm, and went straight to the cooperative committee. She almost cried in front of the Party branch secretary and the director of the cooperative, and said with shame: "I am a Party member and a cadre of the Youth League, I can't push the difficult work to others..."
    The cooperative committee finally agreed to Feng Jian's request and decided to send her to the county's feeder training class to study. This matter could no longer be kept from her mother. That day, as soon as she got home, her mother asked angrily: "You, a little girl, can you feed a few pigs? What if you feed a few pigs? What can you contribute?" No matter how Feng Jian explained the importance of developing pig production to the country, and how glorious it was to be a feeder, her mother wouldn't listen to her. Her mother insisted: It's a sin for a little girl to feed pigs! Feng Jian couldn't convince her mother, and her mother couldn't convince Feng Jian, so she went to the county to study. Before going to the county, her mother was so angry that she not only didn't pack her clothes, but didn't even give her money for food.
    Feng Jian studied in the county for six days and returned to work in the Seventh Breeding Farm. At this time, the masses were also talking about it. Some said: "The Party has cultivated Feng Jian for many years, why doesn't she become a full-time cadre, why is she feeding pigs?" Others even calculated her horoscope and said: "Feeding pigs is not an easy job, wait and see, she won't last long." Her mother, because she felt sorry for her daughter and couldn't stop her, was so angry that she wouldn't even talk to her.
    The Seventh Breeding Farm raised more than eighty pigs, with only three feeders. The two male feeders spent all day collecting water chestnut vines on the lake, so she stayed in the farm, cutting, cooking, and cooling the feed for these eighty pigs by herself. The breeding farm was newly built, and there was no well nearby, so she had to carry dozens of loads of water from a distant place every day. In this way, from before sunrise to after moonrise, at the end of the day, when eating dinner, Feng Jian's arms couldn't even lift chopsticks and bowls. Just being tired wasn't all, the smell of cleaning the pigsty and removing manure was so bad that she couldn't eat for days and felt nauseous when she thought about it. She wanted to wear a mask, but was worried about gossip, so she gritted her teeth and rolled up her trouser legs and sleeves and jumped into the manure pit. That seemingly insurmountable difficulty, Feng Jian finally overcame again, and she did not let the horoscope that the masses calculated for her come true.
    In 1956, the number of pigs in the Dahu Township Advanced Cooperative increased from more than two hundred to more than eight thousand and sixty, exceeding the income from rice, and ensuring the lives of the cooperative members in the years of severe drought. At the Third National Congress of the Communist Youth League, when Feng Jian stood in front of the solemn podium and reported to the delegates from all over the country about the pig farming business in their cooperative, how excited and joyful she must have felt! Because the great achievements of the development of pig production in the Dahu Township Advanced Cooperative in Wangcheng County, Hunan Province, which has become a national model, also contain a share of her hard work, and contain so many of her troubles and joys.
    Oh, young people who are deeply worried about their future, seek the golden key to life from the path that Feng Jian has taken.

    从高小毕业生到合作社饲养员
    冯健参加农业劳动的故事
    当冯健离别了打着锣鼓欢送她的家乡的人们，再一次来北京参加团的第三次全国代表大会的时候，一路之上，望着船舱外边波涛起伏的湘江，望车窗外边延伸无尽的田野，她心里是如此畅朗和兴奋！她感到自己好像和我们的整个国家，和我们的全体人民，紧紧地拥合在一起了。回想到三年多以前，她为自己的前途而哭泣的那些个夜晚，真像是迷失在暗无天日的森林里，种种个人的忧虑和追求蒙蔽了她的眼睛，使她看不见正确的生活道路。而一旦她从那种种个人的追求之中解放出来，忠诚无我地献身于人民的集体事业时，就好像得到了一把童话里的金钥匙，生活立即在她面前展开了新天地……
      决心留在家乡
    1953年，冯健从高小毕业，没有考取中学的那个夏天，她哭泣过多少个夜晚！她不仅怕见亲友同学，甚至也不敢到长沙的大街上去——看见街上熙攘来往的行人，她也羞红了脸，就像大家都认识她，都知道她没有考取中学似的。她离别了在长沙商店里作会计的父亲，回到湘江岸上的家乡。在乡下的家里，痛苦也依然不能减轻，她隐居到一间板楼上不下来，妈妈只得给她送饭上去，而她那里能够下咽。更可怕的是那些不眠的夜晚，她愈想愈没有出路，简直要发疯了。
    这时候，乡里正在筹办初级社。县工作组的李度同志，党支书吴吟钦同志，还有党员吴春爹同志，大家都来劝说冯健，向她讲农村的灿烂的远景，留她在社里作信用社的会计。冯健嘴上唯唯诺诺地答应着，心里却反感得很。农村实行合作化，将来会像苏联农村一样美好，这点她坚信不移，而且，她在小学的时候，还曾幻想过作拖拉机手。但现在，农村说得上什么拖拉机呢！到苏联那样，还得多少年月？
    党支部、团支部继续对冯健进行教育，最后，徐建春的事迹终于打动了她的心。徐建春和她一样是高小毕业生，是十几岁的女孩子，人家能参加农村的生产劳动，而且作出那样的贡献，她为什么不能够呢？
    冯健答应了作信用社的会计。但这时，妈妈还在托人给她打听外边有什么工厂招收工人，她自己也抱着暂时作作看的思想，并且因为耽心将来有机会出去时脱不得身，她对工作就马马虎虎，心想只要账目不错就行了。但工作是马虎不得的，不久，账目就发生了错误！在一次结算当中，差十块钱，怎么也对不拢来。还只有十五岁的冯健吓坏了——如果被别人知道，说她是贪污可怎么办？她暗暗急了很久，终于提心吊胆地告诉了那把她当孙女看待的党员吴春爹。大大出于冯健的意料之外，吴春爹不但没有责备她，还找了银行的营业员来帮她查了几夜账，那十块钱查对出来了。这件事，深深感动了冯健的幼小的心灵，她怀着愧疚的心情，怀着对关心她如亲人的同志们的感激，决心要把信用社的会计工作做好，决心留在这处处感到温暖的家乡了。
    热爱上了农业劳动
    冯健晚上做会计工作，白天参加生产。她第一次劳动，是去修堤。那天来到堤上，看见根本没有妇女，她就有点发怯。当她挑起土筐，来回行走在石子路上时，脚掌疼得呀，心里直发慌。而且，挑多了，压得腰杆直不起，挑少了，又怕别人笑话。她硬撑着干一上午，下午便歇在家里了。晚上吴春爹来，他对冯健说道：“头难头难，少挑子慢慢来，怕什么啰！”听着这话，冯健忽然想起了她的红领巾。在学校作少先队大队长时，红领巾曾鼓励她克服过多少困难！第二天，她又鼓起劲上了堤，终于挑了六十几分工，并且带动四十几个妇女参加了修堤工程。
    这劳动战线上的第一回合使冯健懂得了一个重要的诀窍——坚持就能胜利。这年冬天，社里展开积肥运动，在霜雪凛人的天气里，冯健和男同志们一起，卷起裤脚下塘去挖塘泥。男同志们好心地劝阻她，但她想：“别人能做，我为什么不能做？劳动就不能怕吃苦！”就这样，冯健——这个唯一的尚未成年的女孩子，和男农民们一起，站在冰冻入骨，齐膝深的塘泥中，一锹一锹地，把自己的力量，献给建设社会主义的伟大劳动。
    自此后，冯健引起了人们的爱戴，她开始虚心学习田里的种种活路。犁田向来是有经验的老农才干得了的农活，但她迎着严冬的寒风，带着满脸满身的泥污，来往于水田里，一天又一天，终于学会了犁田。就这样，冯健以她的实际行动把自己提高到先进青年的行列，1954年3月，团支部吸收她加入了青年团。在入团宣誓的大会上，党支书吴吟钦同志，对“为保卫祖国和实现社会主义社会而奋斗”这句誓词作了热情的讲解，这句誓词火种般留在了冯健的心里。自此后，她确实没有辜负“青年团员”这个光荣的称号，这一年的生产中，她事事走在群众的前边，如像她带动大家抢补油菜苗，如像她宣传插种红薯和双季稻，如像她推广盐水选种，如像她创造了一亩田三斤种谷的经验，与试验杂交，培养新的稻谷品种。
     在危急的时刻
    像很多女孩子一样，冯健怕鬼，怕走黑路，甚至从塘边过时还怕失足跌进塘水里去。1954年秋，南方各省多年稀有的大雨，湘江泛滥的那天晚上，风声雷声，震撼天地，就着闪电的亮光，冯健跟大家一起往堤上跑，她忘记了害怕啦。到了堤上，浑身湿透，男同志都劝她回去，她那里肯回去呢？在人民的生命财产危在旦夕的时刻，她——一个青年团员，怎能不管不顾！当堤上出现了裂缝，水浪汹涌地扑进田里来时，很多人都吓得退下堤来，躲在禾田里不知如何是好。在这危急的时刻，冯健想起了刘胡兰！刘胡兰对敌人的铡刀都不畏惧，难道自己就怕了大水？这样一想，冯健立刻浑身都是胆量，她扑通一声，跳下水去。男青年们楞了一刻之后，便也接二连三地跳下了水，大家拔起禾蔸，终于把裂缝堵住。就这样，冯健留在堤上三天三夜没有回家，直到大水稍退，村子脱离险境。
    经过这次抢险，在大家的心目中，冯健不仅是可爱可亲，而且可钦可敬了。大家对这个小姑娘怀着与她的年龄不相称的尊重与信任，秋后扩社，她当选为西塘农业社的副社长。1955年，她又当选社的劳动模范，出席了全省和全国的青年社会主义建设积极分子大会。
    在北京开会，意外地看见毛主席的那一刻，冯健不禁眼泪直涌。一路回来，她总想着申请入党的事，想着到了十八岁，就一定要站到党的队伍里来，这样自己才不愧对毛主席！
    冯健确实没有愧对毛主席，她继续在每一件具体的工作和劳动当中考验自己，1956年春，还没有满十八周岁时，她就在毛主席的像前，又含着眼泪，庄严地宣读了共产党员的誓词。
    不作会计要作饲养员
    1956年春，社里把几十个先后离学校不久的青年人规划作饲养员时，有几个女孩子伤心地哭了。这时，担任全社会计的冯健，便向社委会申请也去作饲养员，但这申请没有得到社委会的同意。
    一天，冯健到饲养场去看刘霞和王爱莲，了解一下她们有些什么困难。这两个女孩子望也不望冯健一眼，冷冷地说道：“什么困难也没得！我们在这好得很！”冯健听着这话，看着她们劳累、烦燥和委曲难忍的神色明白了一切。冯健蹲下来一边帮她们切饲料，一边说：“慢慢来，任什么工作，开头总是困难……”“困难不困难也得干，”刘霞话中有刺地答道，“我们这些没得文化没得能力的人不来喂猪，哪个来喂呀？”王爱莲立刻接着说：“人家要作脱产干部啦！人家说当饲养员，还不是带带头，骗骗我们这些蠢包！”冯健听着，一声不响，从饲养场出来，径直往社委会去。她在党支书和社主任面前几乎哭了，她惭愧地说道：我是党员，又是团的干部，我不能把困难的工作推给别人……”
    社委会终于答应了冯健的要求，决定送她到县上的饲养训练班去学习。这事情再也瞒不住妈妈了，那天她一回家，妈妈就气冲冲地劈脸问道：“你个细妹子，能喂得几只猪？喂上几只猪又怎么样？又能贡献些什么？”无论冯健怎样解说发展生猪对国家的重要，当饲养员如何光荣，妈妈也不听她的，妈妈一口咬定：细妹子喂猪，真造孽！冯健说服不了妈妈，妈妈更说服不了冯健，她还是上县学习去了。上县以前，妈妈气得不但不给她收拾衣物，连吃饭的钱也不给她。
    冯健在县上学习六天，回来到第七饲养场工作。这时，群众也议论纷纷，有的说：“党培养冯健好几年，不当脱产干部，怎么倒喂起猪来？”更有人给她算八字道：“喂猪这个活路不易得，等着看吧，她保险长不了。”妈妈呢，因为心疼女儿，又阻拦不住她，气得话都不和她说了。
    第七饲养场喂猪八十多头，只有三个饲养员。两个男饲养员整天在湖上捞菱角藤，她便留在场里，一个人要把这八十多头猪的饲料切好，煮熟，再冷凉，然后喂给猪吃。饲养场初建，附近没有井，每天还要到很远的地方去挑几十担水。这样，从太阳没出，到月亮升起，一天下来，吃晚饭时，冯健的两只胳膊连筷子和碗都举不起了。单是劳累还不算，打扫猪栏除粪的时候，那个臭气呀，熏得她几天都吃不下饭，想起来就发噁心。她本想戴个口罩，又顾虑别人的闲话，便一横心，挽起裤脚袖管，就往粪栏里跳。那好像简直不能克服的困难，冯健终于又坚持过来了，她没有让群众给她算的八字算对。
    1956年，大湖乡高级社的生猪从二百多头发展到八千零六十多头，超过稻谷的收入，在酷旱成灾的年月，保证了社员的生活。在团的第三次全国代表大会上，当冯健站在庄严的讲台前面，向大厅里全国各地的代表们，作他们社里的养猪事业的报告时，她心里该怀着多么大的激动和喜悦！因为，成为全国表率的湖南望城县大湖乡高级社生猪发展的巨大成绩之中，也包含着她的一份艰辛的劳动，包含着她多少的苦恼和欢乐。
    在为自己的前途深深忧虑着的青年人呵，从冯健走过的道路上，去寻求生活里的那把金钥匙吧。
