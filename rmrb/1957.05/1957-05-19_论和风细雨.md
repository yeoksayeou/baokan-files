    On Gentle Breeze and Fine Rain	Xu Maoyong
    During the rectification campaign, adopting a gentle breeze and fine rain approach for mutual criticism is aimed at seeking unity and also seeking development.

    Any method must have an ideological foundation. To achieve a gentle breeze and fine rain style of criticism, one must first start from the desire for unity, and, moreover, must start from the desire to achieve new unity on a new foundation. If there is no desire for unity at all, then it is difficult to achieve gentle breeze and fine rain in criticism; but if one is only passively afraid of hindering existing unity and does not want to establish unity on a new foundation, then gentle breeze and fine rain will only become drifting raindrops and windblown leaves, having no effect on development. Such gentle breeze and fine rain was not absent in the past, but that was the normal climate; once it came to rectification, it would turn into a violent storm.

    Therefore, I believe that now and in the future, on the one hand, there must be frequent gentle breeze and fine rain, and on the other hand, it must penetrate thoroughly.

    In this way, things are not simple, and there are some issues worth studying.

    Gentle breeze and fine rain is to avoid hurting feelings and harming people, but on the other hand, it must also not harm the facts or damage the truth. "Seeking truth from facts" is always the highest principle of criticism; only by seeking truth from facts can we cure the sickness and save the patient. If the diagnosis is wrong, the "tiger and wolf medicine" is certainly bad, but does the light dose of angelica, dried tangerine peel, and white peony root have any beneficial effect! Therefore, when criticizing, as long as the facts are stated accurately, the reasoning is correct, and the person is allowed to repeatedly defend themselves, without exaggeration or obliteration, without arbitrarily labeling, without rushing to conclusions, and even more without mobilizing masses who do not know the details to attack according to the one-sided materials and subjective intentions provided by the leaders, then the criticism will naturally become a gentle breeze and fine rain with appropriate measure.

    Secondly, the criticized person should be allowed to talk about objective reasons. Because all facts generally have both subjective and objective reasons, but in each specific fact, the primary and secondary positions of the two aspects are different. For example, liberalism is generally wrong, but some people's liberal words and deeds are provoked by extremely serious bureaucracy. In such cases, people who commit the error of liberalism, while examining their own errors, should be allowed, and should be considered, to talk about the facts of bureaucracy that are objective to them. Allowing this, considering this, criticism will also be gentle breeze and fine rain. Otherwise, setting aside the objective and focusing solely on the subjective, the subjective "motives" will be seen as harboring ulterior motives; or, if the criticized person talks a little about the objective, people will say that he is dishonest, that he is sophistry, that he is continuing to attack the leadership; then the criticism will surely turn into a violent storm.

    Therefore, one must also carefully consider the situation and reason. The old saying often goes: "Reason is unforgivable, but circumstances are excusable," or "Circumstances are excusable, but reason is unforgivable." I believe that the consideration of these circumstances and reason lies in the relationship between the subjective and the objective. The so-called "reason is unforgivable" means that the subjective error, no matter how small, is always unreasonable, and must be criticized and affirmed; the so-called "circumstances are excusable" refers to the fact that the occurrence of certain errors has significant objective reasons, so they should be understood to some extent. Naturally, errors committed knowingly cannot be forgiven; errors with small objective reasons and large subjective reasons deserve less understanding. I once heard that the old Shaoxing secretaries were good at manipulating words to influence conclusions. For example, in a homicide case, the draft verdict he prepared originally said that the offender's "circumstances were excusable, but the crime was unforgivable," which meant he should be killed; but later he received a bribe, and without changing a single word in the original draft, he simply reversed the two sentences, turning them into "the crime was unforgivable, but the circumstances were excusable," thus lightly escaping the death penalty. This Shaoxing secretary's abuse of power for personal gain is naturally not to be emulated; however, objectively, both situations of "circumstances are excusable, but the crime is unforgivable" and "the crime is unforgivable, but the circumstances are excusable" do exist. The proportion of circumstances to reason is also like this. Therefore, in handling contradictions among the people, as long as we seek truth from facts and carefully consider the situation and reason, the criticism will be a gentle breeze and fine rain.

    Furthermore, the critic's own posture must be steady. We have seen many such things: some people, in the previous months, were praised by people, including some leaders; but once they made some mistakes, the critics would criticize them completely, and they themselves would examine and say: "In the past, our level of understanding was low, and we were deceived by you. Now that we have studied the documents, our awareness has improved, and our eyes have been opened..." including some leaders. I believe that this situation is abnormal. The difference in the level of awareness before and after, especially in leaders, is not necessarily so vastly different. In order to stir up a violent storm and show that their eyes are bright now, but describe their past eyes as completely blind, is not an attitude of seeking truth from facts.

    Therefore, I believe that correctly carrying out gentle breeze and fine rain style criticism is not an easy task, and requires learning and training: first, the heart must be calm, that is, truly regard the criticized person as a comrade; second, the facts must be real, which requires the effort of investigation and research; third, the reasoning must be clear, which requires understanding more Marxism-Leninism. Without these, just talking about "gentle air" is very abstract and cannot be achieved.

    Finally, I would like to repeat what I said above: criticism must be carried out at any time, clarifying right and wrong and resolving contradictions at any time and in any matter, and not just waiting for the movement to settle accounts.

    论和风细雨	徐懋庸
    在整风中，采取和风细雨的方式来进行相互批评，是为了求得团结，也为了求得发展。
    任何方式一定要有思想做基础。要做到批评方式的和风细雨，首先必须从团结的愿望出发，而且必须从在新的基础上达到新的团结的愿望出发。如果，根本没有团结的愿望，那么，批评起来就难做到和风细雨；但如果，只是消极地怕妨害现有的团结，而不想在新的基础上建立团结，那么，和风细雨只会成为飘飘忽忽的雨丝风片，于发展毫无作用。这样的和风细雨，在过去并不是没有的，但那是平时的气象，一到整风，可就变成狂风暴雨了。
    所以，我以为，现在和今后，一方面必须有经常的和风细雨，另一方面又必须下透。
    这样，事情就不简单，很有些问题值得研究。
    和风细雨，是为了不伤感情，不损人身，但另一方面，也要不伤事实，不损真理。“实事求是”，总是批评的最高原则；只有实事求是，才能治病救人。断错了病，“虎狼药”固然坏事，难道轻量的当归、陈皮、白芍药就有良效！所以，批评的时候，只要事实说得确，道理讲得对，还让本人反复辩解，无所夸大，也无所抹煞，不乱扣帽子，不急下结论，更不发动不明底细的群众只按领导所供给的片面材料和主观意图鸣鼓而攻，那么，批评自然而然就会成为分寸得当的和风细雨的了。
    其次，还要让被批评者讲讲客观原因。因为凡实事，一般总是有主观和客观两方面的原因的，不过在每个具体事实中，两方面的主次地位有所不同而已。例如，自由主义，一般地说来是错误的，但是有些人的自由主义的言行，却是极端严重的官僚主义所激成，在这样的情况下，犯自由主义错误的人，在和检讨自己的错误同时，讲讲对他是客观的官僚主义的事实，应该被容许，也应该被考虑。容许了这，考虑了这，批评起来也就会和风细雨。否则，撇开客观，专究主观，那主观“动机”就会被看得居心叵测；或者，被批评者讲了一点客观，人们就说他不老实，他说诡辨，说他继续向领导进攻；那么，批评一定会变成狂风暴雨的了。
    因此，还得斟酌情理。旧话常说：“理无可恕，情有可原”，或者说“情有可原，理无可恕”，我以为这情理的斟酌，就在于主观和客观的关系上。所谓“理无可恕”，就是主观上的错误无论大小，总是不合理的，要批评，要肯定；所谓“情有可原”，就是指某些错误的发生，有其重大的客观原因，所以应该有所谅解。自然，明知故犯的错误，是不能原谅的；客观原因小而主观原因大的错误，该得到的谅解就少。我曾听说，过去的绍兴师爷是善于以玩弄文字左右结论的，譬如，有一个命案，他拟的判稿。本来是说犯罪者“情有可原，罪无可赦”，那就该杀；但后来他得了贿赂，就并不改动原稿一个字，只把那两句颠倒处理一下，变成“罪无可赦，情有可原”，就把死刑轻轻出脱了。这个绍兴师爷的营私舞弊，自然是不足为训的；但是，客观实际上，“情有可原，罪无可赦”或“罪无可赦，情有可原”的两种情况，确实都有。情与理的比重，也如此。所以，在处理人民内部的矛盾时，只要实事求是地斟情酌理，那批评就会是和风细雨的。
    还有，批评者自己的身架，要摆得稳一点。我们见过不少这样的事情：有的人，在前几个月，被人们大叫其好，连有些领导人也在内；但一旦犯了一些错误，批评者们就把他吹求得体无完肤，并且自己检讨说：“过去我们认识水平低，受了你的欺骗，现在学了文件，我们觉悟提高了，眼睛擦亮了……”，连某些领导人也在内。我以为这种情况是不正常的。前后的觉悟水平的差别，特别在领导人，不见得就是这样差以千里的。为了掀起一场狂风暴雨，显示自己现在的眼睛亮，却把自己过去的眼睛形容成全瞎，也不是实事求是的态度。
    所以，我以为，正确地开展和风细雨式的批评，并不是一件容易的事，这需要学习，需要锻炼：第一，心要平，就是把被批评者真正看作同志；第二，事要实，这就要有调查研究的工夫；第三，理要通，这就要多多懂点马列主义。不具备这些，光讲“气和”，那是很抽象，而且做不到的。
    最后，我想把上面说过的话重述一句：批评，一定要随时进行，随时随事弄清是非，解决矛盾，不要只等到运动来时算总帐。
