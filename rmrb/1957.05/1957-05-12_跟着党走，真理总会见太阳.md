    Follow the Party, and the Truth Will Always See the Sun
            Pang Xunqin, Vice President of the Central Academy of Arts and Crafts
    An infant abandoned by heartless parents, subjected to wind and rain, has finally been picked up. That infant is the Central Academy of Arts and Crafts, those heartless parents are the Ministry of Culture, and the wind and rain are the crude interference of the Handicraft Bureau.

    On May 4th, the Ministry of Culture convened a symposium, and five comrades from the Central Academy of Arts and Crafts were invited to attend. I was one of the five, and I had this feeling when I attended this symposium at the Ministry of Culture:

    It was as if an infant abandoned by heartless parents had finally been picked up! The heartless parents are the Ministry of Culture. The infant is the newly established Central Academy of Arts and Crafts. The child was battered by wind and rain during the period of abandonment, and the wind and rain were the unreasonable and crude interference of some people in the Handicraft Bureau with the work of art education.

    Although the Central Academy of Arts and Crafts is a newly established school, the work of arts and crafts education has a history of more than 20 years. In the old society, some arts and crafts educators had worked hard many times to establish an independent higher school of arts and crafts, but they never succeeded and were constantly打击 and suppressed.

    After liberation, the Party and the government attached great importance to arts and crafts. Therefore, in 1950, it was proposed to establish an academy of arts and crafts. In 1952, preparations began, and a series of reforms were carried out in the work of education, criticizing the detachment from reality in the past teaching work, and combining it with many specific tasks, such as designing national day ceramics for the State Council in 1952, preparing the National Folk Arts and Crafts Exhibition in 1953, preparing the arts and crafts exhibition abroad in 1954, launching the improvement work of calico design in 1955, launching the improvement work of clothing design in 1956, etc., and carried out thousands of creative design activities. In theory, the direction of arts and crafts was also gradually clarified. Arts and crafts, like all literature and art, serve the workers, peasants and soldiers, which is also the direction of arts and crafts. Letting a hundred flowers bloom is the method of developing art, and it is the Party's policy for literary and artistic work, and arts and crafts are no exception. At the same time, it was also clarified that the principles of economy, practicality, and aesthetics must be implemented in the creative design work of arts and crafts. In terms of cadres, old professors and young comrades, Party members and non-Party members, also gradually dispelled the estrangement and worked together for the development of arts and crafts. Due to the above conditions, and the Handicraft Bureau promised to give up a house outside Fuchengmen as a temporary school building, in the summer of 1956, the Central Academy of Arts and Crafts was finally officially established. This was a groundbreaking event in China's cultural undertakings. However, due to the serious bureaucracy of the Ministry of Culture, this newly established school suffered completely unnecessary setbacks. When the Ministry of Culture decided to establish this academy, it did not consult with arts and crafts workers in advance, nor did it correctly estimate the progress and efforts of arts and crafts workers under the education of the Party over the years, nor did it respect the specialties of these comrades. It hastily saw that the Handicraft Bureau could give up a house, so it decided that the business would be led by the Ministry of Culture and the administration would be led by the Handicraft Bureau. The Ministry of Culture simply pushed this school out of the way. Separating business leadership from administrative leadership, the business leadership actually became an empty phrase with a name but no reality, while the administrative leadership was completely layman in business, which became an obstacle to promoting business, and the leading comrades of the Handicraft Bureau had serious subjectivism and sectarianism, which caused this newly established school to suffer all kinds of unnecessary losses and destruction from the beginning. Deng Jie, Deputy Director of the Handicraft Bureau, concurrently served as the President of our Academy. Since the establishment of the Academy, the total time he spent at the school has been less than 200 hours. He sent the Director of the Sales Bureau of the Handicraft Bureau to be his "President Representative." And when a Vice President was still abroad and a Vice President was ill in the hospital, the President suddenly declared that the school was a mess and that students should stop being admitted; at the same time, he proposed to change the school into a handicraft workshop. And among the young Party and League members, he slandered me personally and held a contemptuous attitude towards some professors. For example, he said to the professors: If you want liberalism, you can have absolute liberalism. If you want to spend money, there are 300,000 yuan... and so on.

    Deng Jie's idea and practice are obviously wrong! Under the education of the Party for many years, Chinese intellectuals are no longer the people he imagined. Most of today's Chinese intellectuals wholeheartedly want to do more for socialist construction. They do not necessarily want to be "chiefs," they do not demand that kind of "liberalism," and they do not care about 300,000 yuan.

    In the eyes of some leading comrades of the Handicraft Bureau, these professors eat foreign bread, are divorced from reality, and are divorced from tradition. He wiped out the work achievements of these comrades over the years. For example, Chai Fei, Director of the Dyeing and Weaving Department, said: "I have cultivated dyeing and weaving art design talents for four generations." His students are almost all over the major printing and dyeing factories in the country. Some have become engineers, some have become advanced workers, and many have won awards. For example, the professors of the Ceramics Department not only have many creations in recent years, but also conducted experiments with Tangshan's second-class porcelain clay in 1956 and created a beautiful rice-yellow porcelain. Dyeing and weaving and ceramics have brilliant achievements in the cultural history of our country, and these things are indispensable in people's lives. However, the leading comrades of the Handicraft Bureau said that opening these departments was divorced from reality and tradition. It seems that only ivory carving and other special handicrafts are considered traditional and practical. We respect these special handicrafts very much, but we do not want to use all our strength to engage in these things. The specialties of the comrades are dyeing and weaving art design, ceramic art design, decoration design, interior decoration design, metal art design, etc. Departments are set up according to the needs of the people and the specialties of the comrades. It cannot be said that this is a mistake in the direction. Under this autocratic attitude, the old professors expressed their desire to leave. For example, Chai Fei, Director of the Dyeing and Weaving Department, wanted to return to East China. Zhu Danian, Director of the Ceramics Department, wanted to be an engineer. Zheng Ke, Leader of the Metalworking Sculpture Teaching and Research Group, wanted to go to Guangzhou. A group of young cadres said: In this situation, we might as well go to Shanghai to set up a design company. I myself am also very contradictory in my thoughts. In recent years, I have been moved by how hard the comrades have worked to establish this academy. I know the origin of many things in the experimental factory, the data room, and the library. I know that every thing is not easy to come by. Should I leave! I feel that this school is lovely. If I stay here, this kind of leadership style is really unbearable. When I am helpless, I can't help but think of what Chairman Mao said at the first Congress of Literary and Art Workers in 1949: We welcome you because the people need you. I think of this sentence, thinking: Follow the Party, and the truth will always see the sun, so I endure and endure, stay and stay, I know that all teaching staff, young and old, are in this mood, all are in this state of mind!

    Once unsuccessful, the leading comrades of the Handicraft Bureau did not realize their mistake, and subjectively drafted the "Draft Plan for Establishing the Central Academy of Arts and Crafts." This draft plan proposed that the academy should be uniformly led by the Handicraft Bureau. The resident representative sent by the Bureau summoned me to the office and said to me: Do you know that as long as the Party Group decides, whether Party members or non-Party members must follow it. At that time, I was really at a loss. I had never seen any decision, and I really didn't know what he was basing his words on? I searched through the Party Constitution and couldn't find this article. It turned out that the Handicraft Bureau had quietly drafted such a draft plan. However, the Vice President officially appointed by the State Council had no right to know about the academy's draft plan, and of course the professors had no right to know in advance. I received this plan on the morning when the draft plan was announced to the public. Deng Jie, Deputy Director and President of the Handicraft Bureau, announced the division of labor of the four presidents at the same time as announcing the plan, without exchanging opinions with the several Vice Presidents, which really surprised me. When was this so-called Administrative Vice President appointed? At the same time, is it possible that the Vice President does not even have the right to speak on whether he agrees with the work assigned to him when the President divides the labor?

    After the plan was announced, several department directors requested to discuss the general issues such as the direction and the leadership relationship of the academy together with several departments. The Handicraft Bureau did not allow it and summoned all the teaching cadres above the lecturer level to the Handicraft Bureau for a meeting. This meeting was personally presided over by Deng Jie, Deputy Director of the Bureau. He started by saying: I am a Communist Party member, I represent the Party... My official position is not high, but it is not small either. At the end of the meeting, he said sternly: We have someone in the Party whose surname is what? ... Unorganized and undisciplined violations of Party discipline will be punished. He turned around and asked the comrades from the Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League who were present at the time: Are there also such unorganized and undisciplined people in your League? Is it illegal to report the situation of the school to the relevant leading departments? I searched through the League member's handbook and couldn't find this article either. What did the Deputy Director of the Handicraft Bureau mean by saying such things at the discussion meeting on the school's plan draft?

    Under this serious bureaucracy, subjectivism, and sectarianism, the school has not held a collective office meeting since its official establishment. This system was cancelled after the school was officially established. The school affairs meeting was held only once when the academy was established. The President rarely comes to the school, and the decisions of the Vice President in charge of business are not valid. All major and minor matters must be submitted to the Handicraft Bureau for approval. Administrative staff can come and go at any time, and the Vice President in charge of business has no right to interfere. When the teaching staff raise some problems in their lives, the administrative staff say: Don't spoil them like the Central Academy of Fine Arts. Some people have also said to the teaching staff: You are guests here, not masters. They think that letting us borrow this empty house is a great gift from the Handicraft Bureau to the arts and crafts workers. Therefore, this situation has long existed in the school: the administrative work is a separate matter, under the command of the Handicraft Bureau. The administration and business of the school are separated, and it is not the administration serving the teaching, but the teaching obeying the requirements of the administration.

    The teaching cadres and most of the administrative cadres of the Central Academy of Arts and Crafts have been educated by the Party for many years. They know that on the one hand, they must wage unremitting struggles against bureaucracy, subjectivism, and sectarianism, but on the other hand, they cannot let the teaching work stop. Although the research work has been greatly hindered, it cannot be completely stopped. Therefore, the teaching work of the school has always been taught and learned in a peaceful atmosphere, and the creative work and research work of the comrades have also been carried out intermittently, but there is no doubt that due to the improper leadership relationship, due to the style of certain leading cadres, there are serious problems. This has caused great losses to this newly established school. We demand that this situation be changed immediately, and the Central Academy of Arts and Crafts should be led by the Ministry of Culture.

    Certain leading cadres of the Handicraft Bureau are also provoking discord and deepening the estrangement between artists and folk artists. The People's Daily published an article on the difficulty of inviting artists. Without investigation and research, Deng Jie added fuel to the fire in his article "Strengthening the Party's Leadership over Arts and Crafts": Some production units have repeatedly invited arts and crafts artists to come and guide them, which is more difficult than inviting Zhuge Liang three times. What does it mean to put such a hat on arts and crafts workers as the President of the Central Academy of Arts and Crafts? This statement has created a very bad influence between artists and artists. Artists and folk artists were originally close and there was no estrangement. Individual comrades in the art world have made some comments on the works of certain artist comrades, which is another matter. Different opinions can be countered. It cannot be seen as the opposition between artists and artist comrades. Is the principle of "economy, practicality, and aesthetics" suitable for certain noble special handicrafts? This is a question that can be discussed, and the principles that should be followed in arts and crafts design work should not be ridiculed for this reason. The scope of arts and crafts is very wide! Noble special handicrafts are also needed, but after all, arts and crafts should mainly serve the daily life of the people. It is hoped that the relevant leading comrades can calm down and deal with these issues, and do not make the issues more and more complicated.

    The team of arts and crafts workers is very small, and the strength is very weak. For example, Professor Zheng Ke is the only talent in our country who studies modern metal crafts. Many courses have to be prepared from scratch. Education work is originally not an easy job. There is an old Chinese saying: It takes ten years to grow trees and a hundred years to cultivate people. An academy like the Central Academy of Arts and Crafts, which is a newly established academy, is still the only higher arts and crafts school in our country, so it needs to be doubly cherished. Recently, many parties have given enthusiastic sympathy and support to this school, which makes all comrades more believe that:

    Follow the Party, and the Truth Will Always See the Sun.

    跟着党走，真理总会见太阳
            中央工艺美术学院副院长　庞熏琴
    一个被忍心的父母所抛弃的婴儿，受到狂风暴雨的吹打，现在终于被捡回来了。这个婴儿是中央工艺美术学院，这个忍心的父母是中央文化部，这狂风暴雨就是手工业管理局的粗暴干涉。
    5月4日文化部召集了一个座谈会，中央工艺美术学院五位同志被邀请去座谈，我是五个人中间的一个，我出席文化部这次座谈会，有这样一种感触：
    好像一个被忍心的父母所抛弃的婴孩，现在终于被捡回来了！这忍心的父母就是文化部。这婴孩就是新创办的中央工艺美术学院。这孩子在被弃时期，被狂风暴雨所吹打，这狂风暴雨就是手工业管理局的一些无理而粗暴的对艺术教育工作的干涉。
    中央工艺美术学院虽然是一个新创立的学校，但是工艺美术教育工作却也已经有了二十多年的历史，在旧社会中间，一些工艺美术教育工作者，也曾经努力过多少次，想建立一个独立的高等工艺美术学校，但是始终没有如愿，而且受到不断的打击和压迫。
    解放以后，党和政府非常重视工艺美术，于是1950年就提出来要成立工艺美术学院，1952年开始筹备，并且在教育工作中进行了一系列的改革工作，批判了过去教学工作上的脱离实际，结合了许多具体任务，例如1952年为国务院设计建国瓷，1953年筹备全国民间工艺美术品展览会，1954年筹备工艺美术出国展览，1955年展开花布设计的改进工作，1956年展开服装设计的改进工作等等，进行了千百次创作设计活动。在理论上也逐步明确了工艺美术的方针方向。工艺美术像一切文学艺术一样，为工农兵服务的方向，也就是工艺美术的方向。百花齐放是发展艺术的方法，是党对文艺工作的政策，工艺美术也并不例外。同时也明确了在工艺美术的创作设计工作中，必须贯彻经济、实用、美观的原则。在干部方面，老教授们和青年同志们，党员和党外同志们，也逐步的打消了隔阂，为工艺美术事业的发展而在共同努力着，由于以上这些条件，同时再加上手工业管理局答应把阜成门外的一座房子让出来作为临时校舍，于是1956年夏天，中央工艺美术学院终于正式成立了，这是我国文化事业中一件破天荒的大事。但是由于文化部的严重官僚主义，使这个初创的学校，受到了完全不必要的挫折。文化部在决定成立这个学院的时候，事前完全没有和工艺美术工作者商量研究，同时也没有正确估计这些年来，在党的教育之下，工艺美术工作者的进步和努力，同时也没有尊重这些同志们的专长是什么，草草率率的只看到了手工业管理局可以让出一座房子来，于是就决定业务由文化部领导，行政由手工业管理局领导。文化部就这样顺手把这个学校推出去不管了。把业务领导和行政领导分家，于是业务领导在实际上变成为一句有名无实的空话，而行政领导又对业务完全外行，结果成为推进业务的阻碍，而手工业管理局的领导同志，又偏偏存在着严重的主观主义和宗派主义，致使这个初创的学校，从一开始就遭受到了种种不必要的损失和摧残。手工业管理局的副局长邓洁同志兼任我院院长，他自建院以来，到校的时间，总加起来，大概不到二百小时，他派手工业管理局的推销局局长来作为他的“院长代表”。并当一个副院长尚在国外、一个副院长卧病医院时期，院长突然宣称这个学校一塌糊涂，要停止招收学生；一面提出要把学校改为手工艺作坊的方案。并在青年党团员中间，对我个人进行诽谤，对一些教授们也抱着一种轻蔑态度。例如对教授们说：你们要自由主义，可以绝对自由主义。你们要花钱，有三十万块钱……等等。
    邓洁同志这种想法和作法，显然是错了！中国的知识分子，在党多年的教育下，已经完全不是他想像的那些人了。中国今天的知识分子，多数是全心全意想为社会主义建设多做一些工作的，他们并不一定想做什么“长”，他们并不要求那种“自由主义”，他们也更不在乎三十万块钱。
    在手工业管理局某些领导同志的眼睛中，这些教授们是吃洋面包的，是脱离实际的，是脱离传统的。他把这些同志们多少年来的工作成绩一笔抹杀。例如，染织系系主任柴扉教授说：“我培养染织工艺设计人才已经有四代。”他的学生几乎遍及全国各大印染工厂。有的当了工程师，有的成为先进工作者，许多人得了奖。又如陶瓷系的教授们，不单这些年来有很多创作，1956年以唐山的次等瓷土进行了试验，创制了一种漂亮的米黄色瓷器。染织和陶瓷在我国的文化史上，是有着辉煌成就的，同时这些东西是人民生活中间必不可缺的东西。但是手工业管理局的领导同志却把开设这些系科，说成是脱离实际、脱离传统。似乎只有象牙雕刻等等特种手工艺才算是传统、才算是实际。我们是非常尊重这些特种手工艺的，但是并不是要用所有的力量都去搞这些东西。同志们的专长是染织工艺设计、陶瓷工艺设计、装璜设计、室内装饰设计、金属工艺设计等等。根据人民的需要和同志们的专长，来设立系科。不能硬说这是方针方向错了。在这种专横态度下，老教授们表示要走。例如：染织系系主任柴扉教授，想回华东去。陶瓷系系主任祝大年教授想去当工程师。金工雕塑教研组组长郑可教授，想到广州去。一群青年干部说：这种情况，我们还不如到上海去搞设计公司。我自己在思想上也是很矛盾的，这几年来看到同志们为了建立这个学院，怎样的不辞辛劳，使我很感动。无论实验工厂中、资料室中、图书馆中很多东西我清楚他们的来历，知道每一件东西都是来处不易。走开吗！觉得这个学校可爱。留在这里罢，这种领导作风，实在使人不能忍受。在无可奈何的时候，不禁总会想起1949年毛主席在第一次文代大会上所说的话：我们欢迎你们，因为人民需要你们。我想着这句话，想着：跟着党走，真理总会见太阳的，于是才忍着忍着，留着留着，我知道所有教学人员不论老老少少都是这样心情，全都是这般心肠！
    一次不成，手工业管理局的领导同志并不觉悟，又主观的草拟了“创办中央工艺美术学院的计划草案”。在这草案中提出了这个学院要由手工业管理局统一领导。管理局派来的驻院代表把我召到办公室去，对我说：你知道不知道，只要党组决定，无论党员或非党员都得照它执行。当时真是丈二和尚摸不着头脑，既没有看到过什么决定，真不知他何所据而云然？翻遍党章也找不到这一条，原来那时手工业管理局已经不声不响的拟好了这么一个草案。而国务院所正式任命的副院长，对学院的草案反而无权知道，当然教授们更无权事前知道了。我是在这个计划草案当众宣布的上午才收到这个计划的，手工业管理局副局长兼院长邓洁同志在宣布这个计划的同时，没有和几个副院长交换意见，就自行宣布了四个院长的分工，这使我真不胜惊讶了，这一位所谓行政副院长究竟是什么时候任命的呢？同时院长分工，难道副院长连对所被分配到的工作是否同意，这样的发言权都没有吗？
    这个计划宣布后，几位系主任要求就关于方针方向和学院的领导关系等总的问题，几个系一道来讨论。手工业管理局不允许，采取了讲师以上的教学干部都召到手工业管理局去开会，这个会由该局副局长邓洁同志亲自主持，他一开始就这样说：我是共产党党员，我代表党……我的官不算大，但是也不小。会议结束的时候他声色俱厉的说：我们党内有个姓什么的？……无组织无纪律违反党纪要处分。他回过头来问当时出席的民盟市委同志：你们盟内是不是也有这种无组织无纪律的人。向有关领导部门反映学校情况，算不算犯法？翻遍了盟员手册也找不到这一条。手工业管理局副局长在学校计划草案的讨论会上说那样的话，是什么意思呢？
    在这种严重的官僚主义、主观主义和宗派主义的领导下，学校从正式成立以来，没有举行过集体办公会议，学校正式成立以后这个制度被取消了。院务会议仅仅在学院成立的时候举行过一次。院长很少来学校，每件事情业务副院长的决定是不算数的，一切大事小事都要拿到手工业管理局去批准。行政人员可以随时来来去去，业务副院长无权过问。教学人员在生活上有些问题提出来，行政人员说：不要把他们像中央美术学院那样搞惯了。也有人对教学人员说过：你们在这里是客人不是主人。把让借了这座空房子认为是手工业管理局对工艺美术工作者的极大恩赐。于是在学校中长期的存在着这种情况：行政工作是另外一摊，受手工业管理局指挥。把学校的行政和业务分了家，不是行政为教学服务，而是要教学服从行政的要求。
    中央工艺美术学院的教学干部及多数行政工作干部，他们多年受党的教育，他们知道一方面要和官僚主义、主观主义和宗派主义作不懈的斗争，但是一方面不能使教学工作停下来，研究工作虽然受到极大阻碍，也不能使它完全停下来，所以学校的教学工作始终在平静的气氛中教和学，同志们的创作工作和研究工作，也始终时断时续的进行着，但是毫无疑问，由于领导关系摆得不恰当，由于某些领导干部的作风，存在严重的问题。使这个初创的学校蒙受到很大的损失。我们要求立即改变这种情况，中央工艺美术学院应该由文化部来领导。
    手工业管理局的某些领导干部，还在美术家和民间艺人之间挑拨是非，加深隔阂。人民日报上刊载了美术家难请的文章，邓洁同志不加调查研究，在他所写的“加强党对工艺美术事业的领导”一文中，竟加油加醋的说：有的生产单位多次邀请工艺美术家亲临指导，比三请诸葛亮还要困难。身兼中央工艺美术学院院长，给工艺美术工作者硬扣这样的帽子是什么意思呢？这种说法，在美术家和艺人之间造成很不好的影响。美术家和民间艺人原来是亲密的，没有什么隔阂的，个别美术界的同志，对某些艺人同志的作品提出了一些意见，那是另外的问题，不同意见可以进行反批评。不能把它看作为是美术家和艺人同志们的对立。“经济、实用、美观”的原则，是不是适合于某些高贵的特种手工艺，这是可以展开讨论的一个问题，也不能因为如此，就对工艺美术设计工作中应该遵守的原则加以嘲笑。工艺美术的范围是很广的！高贵的特种手工艺也需要，但是毕竟工艺美术主要的是应该为人民的日常生活服务。希望有关的领导同志能够冷静下来对待这些问题，不要把问题愈搞愈复杂。
    工艺美术工作者的队伍是很小的，力量是很薄弱的，例如像郑可教授是我国研究现代金属工艺独一无二的人才。许多课程都是要从头准备，教育工作原来不是一件轻松的工作，中国有句老话：十年树木、百年树人。像中央工艺美术学院这样一个初创的学院，还是我国惟一的这样一个高等工艺美术学校，对它就需要倍加爱护。最近多方面对这个学校给予热烈的同情和支持，使所有的同志们更相信：
    跟着党走，真理总会见太阳的。
