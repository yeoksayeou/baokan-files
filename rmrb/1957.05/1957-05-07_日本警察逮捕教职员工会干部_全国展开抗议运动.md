    Japanese Police Arrest Trade Union Cadres of Teachers and Staff
    National Protest Movement Unfolds
    (Comprehensive report from this newspaper) The arrest of trade union cadres of teachers and staff in Saga Prefecture by Japanese police has triggered a nationwide protest movement.
    On April 24th, Japanese police searched 42 locations, including the headquarters, branches, sub-branches of the Saga Prefecture Teachers and Staff Union, and the residences of union executive committee members, arresting ten union cadres, including the secretary-general. The police justified this action by claiming that the "sick leave struggle" conducted by the Saga Prefecture Teachers and Staff Union in mid-February to oppose layoffs violated the "Local Public Service Law."
    This spring, workers in various parts of Japan launched large-scale unified struggles to improve their living standards and defend their democratic rights. In this context, the Japanese government has adopted violent suppression tactics. It first challenged the National Railway Workers' Union, seeking to discipline the union's cadres, but faced strong resistance and has not succeeded to this day. Therefore, it changed its plans and first targeted the teachers and staff union in a certain prefecture.
    On the very day this outrage occurred, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) convened an emergency meeting to discuss countermeasures, calling on all workers to fight back against the reactionary forces. The next day, the Countermeasures Committee against the Japanese government's suppression of the Spring Struggle decided to immediately launch a protest movement and send an investigation team to Saga Prefecture to support their struggle. The Japan Teachers' Union has taken emergency measures, deciding to convene a national representatives' meeting in Saga Prefecture on May 5th to launch a protest movement. The 540,000 members of teachers and staff unions in various parts of Kyushu have already taken action and formed a support system. Currently, a nationwide protest movement is unfolding.

    日本警察逮捕教职员工会干部
    全国展开抗议运动
    本报综合报道　日本警察逮捕佐贺县教职员工会干部的事件，引起了全国性的抗议运动。
    4月24日，日本警察对佐贺县教职员工会本部、支部、分会和工会执行委员的住宅等四十二处进行搜查，逮捕了书记长等十名工会干部。警察方面的借口是：佐贺县教职员工会在2月中旬为反对解雇而进行的“请假斗争”，违反了“地方公务员法”。
    今年春天，日本各地职工为改善生活、保卫民主权利，进行了大规模的统一斗争。在这种情况下，日本政府采取了暴力镇压的手段，它先向国营铁道工会挑战，要处分铁道工会干部，但碰到了坚强的抵抗，迟到今天未能得手。于是改变计划，先向一个县的教职员工会开刀。
    这一暴行发生的当天，日本工会总评议会就召开紧急会议，研究对策，号召全体工人对反动势力，予以反击。第二天，反对日本政府镇压春季斗争的对策委员会，决定立即展开抗议运动，并派遣调查团前往佐贺县支持他们的斗争。日本教职员工会已经采取紧急措施，决定于5月5日在佐贺县召开全国代表会议，掀起抗议运动。九州各地的教职员工会五十四万会员，已经行动起来，组成了支援体制。目前，全国性的抗议运动正在展开。
