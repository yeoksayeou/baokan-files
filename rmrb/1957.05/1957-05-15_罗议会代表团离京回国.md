Xinhua News Agency, May 14th. The Romanian Grand National Assembly and Bucharest City People's Council delegation, headed by Chairman Constantin Pârvulescu, left Beijing by plane this morning to return home.

Chairman Liu Shaoqi said at the airport: The delegation is about to leave our country, and we are here to see you off with feelings of reluctance. Your friendly visit has further strengthened the direct ties between our two parliaments, deepened the mutual understanding and brotherly friendship between our two peoples, and enhanced the solidarity between our two countries. On behalf of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and the entire Chinese people, he expressed his heartfelt gratitude for the delegation's visit and asked the delegation to convey the sincere friendship of the 600 million Chinese people to the fraternal Romanian people.

He said that this short visit has promoted and strengthened the friendly ties between our two brotherly countries.

Chairman Constantin Pârvulescu said that wherever we went, we saw that the Chinese people had such a desire: to continuously strengthen the friendship between our two countries, to continuously strengthen the solidarity of the socialist camp, and to promote the further development of the socialist cause. He thanked the Chinese hosts for their friendship. He said, we are taking away the friendship of the great and heroic Chinese people, the leaders of the state and the Communist Party, and the leaders of all democratic parties who are cooperating with the Communist Party in carrying out the construction cause. After returning home, we will do everything possible to publicize the achievements of the Chinese people, introduce the Chinese people's friendship to us, and thus strengthen the friendship between our two countries.

After he said "goodbye" to all the people who came to see them off, Chairman Liu Shaoqi hugged him tightly. At this moment, warm applause rang out at the airport.
