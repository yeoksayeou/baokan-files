Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 28th. The goal of catching up with the United States in per capita livestock product production within the next few years is inspiring Soviet agricultural workers. Recently, many state farms and collective farms have been revising their plans according to this goal, putting forward higher production guarantees.

News from various regions indicates that many areas can complete this task within this Five-Year Plan. The Poltava Oblast decided to achieve a per capita milk production of 519 kilograms, meat 143 kilograms, and oil 8.4 kilograms by 1960, which will greatly exceed the US production level of these three livestock products in 1956 (the US had 343 kilograms of milk, 102.3 kilograms of meat, and 3.8 kilograms of oil last year). The Lviv Oblast decided to produce 35 quintals of meat and 150 quintals of milk per 100 hectares of agricultural land this year. The "Truth" Collective Farm in the Massalin District of the Azerbaijan Republic decided to produce 120 quintals of meat and 500 quintals of milk per 100 hectares of agricultural land by 1960, which also greatly exceeds the target of 42 quintals of meat and 141 quintals of milk recently proposed by Comrade Khrushchev.

The main steps planned by the collective farms to achieve the goal are to develop feed bases, increase maize production, and develop poultry and sheep breeding.

At the same time, workers in Soviet industrial and mining enterprises expressed their support for agricultural workers in completing this task.

    几年内使畜产品生产水平赶上美国
    苏农业劳动者争订增产计划
    新华社莫斯科28日电　按人口平均计算使畜产品在最近几年内赶上美国的目标鼓舞着苏联农业劳动者。最近许多国营农场和集体农庄都在按照这个目标修改自己的计划，提出了更高的生产保证。
    各地传来的消息表明，许多地区在这个五年计划内就可以完成这个任务。波尔塔发州决定在1960年使全州按人口平均计算的牛奶产量达到五百一十九公斤、肉类一百四十三公斤、油脂八点四公斤，这将大大超过1956年美国在这三种畜产品方面的生产水平（美国去年牛奶是三百四十三公斤、肉类一○二点三公斤、油脂三点八公斤）。利沃夫州决定今年在每一百公顷农业用地上生产肉类三十五公担，牛奶一百五十公担。阿塞拜疆共和国马萨林区“真理”集体农庄决定在1960年使每一百公顷农业用地生产肉类一百二十公担，牛奶五百公担，这也大大超过最近赫鲁晓夫同志所提出的四十二公担肉类和一百四十一公担牛奶的目标。
    集体农庄拟定的达到目标的主要步骤是发展饲料基地，增加玉蜀黍产量，同时发展家禽业和饲羊业。
    和这同时，苏联工矿企业的工人们表示要支持农业劳动者完成这一任务。
