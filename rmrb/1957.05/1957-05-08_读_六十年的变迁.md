    Reading "Sixty Years of Change"
    Zhou Libo
    Comrade Li Liuru's "Sixty Years of Change," Volume 1, has been published. Some people have written commentaries on it, and the novel itself, when it was published in "People's Literature" and "Beijing Daily" successively, had already received a significant response, so there's no need for me to say much more. I'll just share a few personal feelings.
    There are all kinds of writers. Some people, from a young age, aspire to be writers, and often their ambition comes to fruition. Generally, they first study literature, and then experience life and observe society. This second task is very important for these people. Without seriously undertaking this kind of work, even with profound literary cultivation, they will be, as Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "Heroes have no place to use their strength." But there are also other writers. They have swum in the ocean of life for many years, with appropriate preparation in thought and literature, and when the time comes, they concentrate, pick up their pens and brushes, and transform the great waves and fine ripples of the past, selecting those with significant meaning and deep impressions, into writing. Comrade Li Liuru and his work belong to the latter category.
    In sixty years, how many events have occurred! To write them all would be impossible. The author uses the experiences of the character Ji Jiaoshu as a thread to run through the entire book, thereby extrapolating on the various lives, characters, and events he witnessed since the late Qing Dynasty. From this, people can see the struggles for property within feudal families, the greedy and ugly state of yamen officials, the inside story of academies, remnants of the imperial examinations, the selling of smiles by prostitutes in hotels, and the malpractices of stewards on foreign ships, in all their various forms. Young people can gain a great deal of knowledge about the old society from this book.
    Because the events are crowded and the characters numerous, the author has no time to use excessive ink to portray the personalities of the characters he involves. But despite this, Ji Jiaoshu, Tong Shaoying, Zhang Shusheng, Zhou Yitai, and even the real-life Li Yuanhong, etc., still leave some vivid impressions on people.
    In terms of style, "Sixty Years of Change" is relatively close to the tradition of classical Chinese novels. The chapter "Fleeing for One's Life to Qinzhou" easily reminds one of "Officialdom Unmasked."
    In the history of the last sixty years, the closer to the present, the more frequent the events, and the more complex, acute, and subtle the struggles between the enemy and ourselves, and the internal contradictions, making it more difficult to write, but also of greater significance. We hope that Comrade Li Liuru will continue to write diligently and complete this work as soon as possible.

    读“六十年的变迁”
    周立波
    李六如同志的“六十年的变迁”初卷出版了，有人做了评论的文章，而小说本身，当它在“人民文学”和“北京日报”先后发表的时候，已经得到了不小的反响，无需我来多说了。我如今只来谈谈个人的一点零感。
    有种种作家。有的人们从年轻的时候起，就立志要做一个作家，往往果然是有志竟成。他们大体都先学文学，然后去经历人生，观察社会。后一项工作，对于这些人是很重要的。没有认真地进行这一种工作，就是很高深的文学修养，他们也会像毛泽东同志指出的一样：“英雄无用武之地”。但也有另外的作家。他们在生活的海洋里，游泳了多年，思想上和文学上也有适当的准备，到了一定的时候，凝神回顾，挥毫染纸，把往日的洪涛和细浪，择其意义重大者，印象深刻者，化而为文章。李六如同志和他的创作是属于后一类的。
    六十年间，有过多少事变呵，要尽写，是写不完的。作者用季交恕这个人物的经历，作为线索，来贯穿全书，从而推演清朝晚季以来的他所目睹的种种生活、人物和事件。从这里面，人们可以看见封建家庭的夺产的斗争，州官衙吏的贪婪的丑态，经馆内幕，科场遗事，旅店里的妓女的卖笑，和外轮上的茶房的陋规，形形色色，不一而足。年轻的人们可以从这本书里，得到有关旧社会的很多的知识。
    因为事情拥挤，人物杂多，作者无暇使用过多的笔墨去刻画他所涉及的人物的性格。但尽管这样，书里的季交恕，童少英，张树声，周姨太，以及实有其人的黎元洪等等，还是给人留下了一些鲜明的印象。
    文体方面，“六十年的变迁”比较地接近我国古典小说的传统。“亡命走钦州”一章，容易使人想起“官场现形记”。
    六十年来的历史，越到晚近，事变越繁剧，敌我斗争和内部矛盾也越发复杂、尖锐和微妙，写来会更费工夫，但也更有重大的意义。我们希望李六如同志继续奋笔，早日完成这部作品。
