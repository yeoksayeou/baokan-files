　　Jordanian Government Continues Repression
　　Patriotic Forces Turn to Underground Struggle
　　This newspaper comprehensively reports that under the massive suppression by the Jordanian authorities, Jordanian patriotic forces have begun to turn to underground struggle.
　　According to a Press Trust of India dispatch from Damascus on May 4th, Jordanian nationalist and left-wing parties have formed an "Independent Arab Front" in a certain place in the Middle East to promote the movement to immediately restore parliamentary government and civil liberties in Jordan. It is said that this underground organization distributed thousands of leaflets calling on the people to rise up against the current rule in Jordan, against the Eisenhower Doctrine, and to strive for Arab unity.
　　A Jordanian government spokesperson stated on May 4th that military tribunals will try Jordanian patriots who were recently arrested. According to sources, former Prime Minister Nabulsi and all available members of his government, as well as dozens of arrested Jordanian military officers, will be subjected to military trial. At the same time, the Jordanian authorities continue to make arrests. King Hussein personally directs the work of purging the army, police, and government agencies.
　　The "Pakistan Times" published an editorial on May 4th stating that the United States' threat to deal with the Jordanian crisis with the Eisenhower Doctrine, the arrival of a large U.S. fleet near Jordan, and discussions about air-dropping paratrooper units into Jordan confirm that "the Eisenhower Doctrine is the most dangerous aspect of American policy."
　　The Libyan "Al-Pioneer" revealed that imperialists are engaging in conspiracies in Jordan under the guise of "fighting communism." The newspaper wrote, "Most of the Jordanian politicians who are accused of being communists are honest patriots who are unwilling to engage in shady deals and unwilling to sacrifice the rights of their people."
　　The newspaper emphasized that the West should be held responsible for the events in Jordan, and it called on Arab countries to vigilantly pay attention to the imperialists' conspiracies in Jordan.

    约旦政府继续施行镇压
    爱国力量转入地下斗争
    本报综合报道　在约旦当局大规模镇压下，约旦爱国力量开始转入地下斗争。
    据印度报业托辣斯大马士革4日消息说，约旦民族主义和左翼政党已经在中东某地成立“独立阿拉伯阵线”，以便推进争取在约旦立即恢复议会政府和公民自由的运动。据说，这个地下组织散发了几千张传单，号召人民起来反对约旦目前的统治，反对艾森豪威尔主义，并且为阿拉伯团结而努力。
    约旦政府发言人4日表示，军事法庭将审讯最近被捕的约旦爱国人士。有消息说，前首相纳布西和他的政府中一切可以找得到的成员，以及被捕的数十名约旦军官都将受军法审讯。同时，约旦当局继续在进行逮捕。侯赛因国王亲自指导清洗陆军、警察和政府机关的工作。
    “巴基斯坦时报”5月4日发表社论说，美国威胁要以艾森豪威尔主义来处理约旦危机，美国一支庞大的舰队开到了约旦的附近，并且还谈论要在约旦空投伞兵部队，证实了“艾森豪威尔主义是美国政策最危险的一面。”
    利比亚“先锋报”揭露帝国主义者用“同共产主义作斗争”的幌子在约旦玩弄阴谋。报纸写道，“大部分被指责为共产主义者的约旦政治家都是不愿意做买卖勾当、不愿意牺牲自己人民权利的正直的爱国者。”
    这家报纸强调西方应该对约旦的事件负责，它号召阿拉伯国家警惕地注意帝国主义者在约旦的阴谋。
