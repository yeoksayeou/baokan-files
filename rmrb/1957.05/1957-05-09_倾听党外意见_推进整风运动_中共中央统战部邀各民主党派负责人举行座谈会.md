Editor's Note: In the past two months, at various meetings attended by non-Party figures and in newspapers and periodicals, many non-Party figures' analyses of internal contradictions among the people and criticisms of the mistakes and shortcomings of the Party and government have greatly benefited Party organizations and people's governments at all levels in correcting mistakes and improving work. After the start of the rectification movement, Party organizations should continue to solicit opinions from non-Party figures. They can not only invite them to forums and ask them to freely criticize errors and shortcomings in their work, but also use individual talks to more fully listen to criticisms and opinions from non-Party figures. The United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee began yesterday to invite leaders of democratic parties to offer opinions on united front work. This is a good way to ask non-Party figures to help us rectify our work style.

(Our Newspaper) News: Since the Party put forward the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" with democratic parties last year, what problems still exist in the relationship between the Party and democratic parties? As our entire Party is about to launch a rectification movement, what ideological and work problems do democratic parties and non-party democrats hope we can solve through rectification? This was the central topic of the forum held by the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee on the afternoon of the 8th, inviting the heads of the central committees of various democratic parties and non-party democrats.

Li Weihan, Minister of the United Front Work Department, and Ping Jiesan, Deputy Minister, gave detailed explanations on the purpose of convening this forum, the status of the Party's united front work inspections in recent years, and some of the current problems in party relations. Minister Li Weihan said that the purpose of convening this meeting is to ask everyone to help us carry out rectification and correct our shortcomings and mistakes. Promoting our rectification through the united front is a first in the history of our Party. Therefore, I hope everyone will express more criticisms.

Deputy Minister Ping Jiesan said that according to the results of inspections from March last year to the present, the implementation of the united front policy in various regions has improved compared with the past. The relationship between the Communist Party and democratic parties and non-party democrats has greatly improved compared with the past; the organizations of various democratic parties have greatly developed; and more publicity has been given to the activities of democratic parties than in the past. However, judging from the current situation, there are still many problems in many aspects. For example, the issues of democratic parties and non-party democrats requesting to strengthen contact and assistance, and the issues of party relations in grassroots organizations, all need to be studied.

Speaking at this meeting were Zhang Bojun, Vice Chairman of the China Democratic League, Xu Deheng, Chairman of the Jiusan Society, Chen Mingshu, Standing Committee Member of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, and Zhang Naiqi, Deputy Director of the Democratic National Construction Association. Luo Longji, Vice Chairman of the Democratic League, made a brief supplementary speech after Vice Chairman Zhang Bojun spoke.

United Front Work Department Has Solicited Opinions Many Times
But There Is No Follow-Up
Zhang Bojun said that before this forum was held, the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League held an enlarged meeting to discuss issues such as the relationship between the Party and non-Party members, and the Democratic League's opinions on the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee. At this meeting, some people said: In the past few years, some members of democratic parties have not played a good role in national affairs. They are capable, but they lack the conditions. For example, a planning section chief in a certain agency, because he is not a Party member, cannot participate in relevant meetings convened by the State Planning Commission that he should attend, and feels very distressed. In the past, when selecting students to study abroad and retaining teaching assistants in schools, political conditions were always examined first. Some people with ability and expertise were often considered to have complicated histories and could not be selected. Non-Party members do not have many opportunities to study abroad. It is very difficult for non-Party cadres to be promoted. Party members are promoted quickly, as if only Party members have the ability and methods. Regarding the issue of having position and power, Zhang Bojun said: Some people say: Position, power, and responsibility are inseparable. To ensure that non-Party leading personnel have position and power, non-Party members must also be responsible. However, in places where non-Party members hold leadership positions, the Party group actually decides everything, and the Party group must be responsible. Since the Party group must be responsible, it cannot not have power. This is the fundamental reason for the formation of the situation where non-Party members have positions but no power. Therefore, some people have proposed that the functions and powers of the Party group and administrative leadership in state organs should be clarified, and the work of each organ should be decided by the legally implemented collective leadership administrative institution.

When talking about opinions on the United Front Work Department, Zhang Bojun said: Some people believe that the United Front Work Department has solicited opinions more than once. Today, some people are unwilling to offer opinions because the opinions offered in the past have not been followed up and there has been no explanation. For example, last year, the United Front Work Department formulated the cadre system of various democratic parties unpreparedly, held several meetings to solicit opinions, but there were no results. Furthermore, in 1950, the United Front Work Department emphasized the issue of having position and power, but seven years later, this issue has not been resolved well. Zhang Bojun also said: Some people in the Democratic League believe that the Party Central Committee does not pay enough attention to united front work from theory, policy to implementation and publicity and education. Some people believe that the Central Committee of the Democratic League is "prolonging life with illness," has no independent views on the long-term coexistence policy, and has no specific measures. This is also because the United Front Work Department has not helped us enough with our "illness," that is, not enough mutual supervision. The United Front Work Department should also check. Others believe that the United Front Work Department cannot solve problems by just holding meetings to solicit opinions, and hope that it can spend more time conducting in-depth visits and individual conversations. During in-depth visits, do not only look for chairpersons and vice-chairpersons, secretaries-general and deputy secretaries-general, but also look for people below.

Can "Prolonging Life with Illness" Extend Life?
Xu Deheng said when talking about the issue of long-term coexistence: Some people say that democratic parties suffer from the "prolonging life with illness" syndrome. Our Jiusan Society is indeed ill, but whether it can prolong life is still a question. Why do I say that? Xu Deheng raised two specific questions. He said: First of all, the issue of cadres is always difficult to solve in the Jiusan Society. People who need to be transferred cannot come, and cadres in office are not at ease with their work. Since last year, the United Front Work Department has only introduced one person, but this person is still wavering. Three years ago, a young man was introduced, but he left later. He said that he studied history and had to leave. Another problem is that since last year, more than two hundred people from the Jiusan Society have joined the Chinese Communist Party, which is progress. However, after they join the Party, they have to withdraw from the Jiusan Society. The chairman of the Nanjing Jiusan Society and the chairman of the Hangzhou Jiusan Society both withdrew after joining the Party. We are thinking: How exactly will long-term coexistence coexist? Since it is long-term coexistence, no matter what, people must come to do the work, and no matter what, there must be organizational members! If this problem is not solved, we dare not inspect the united front work. How to solve it? Xu Deheng said: Now we are appealing to the United Front Work Department for help, that is, we are ill, and we are asking the United Front Work Department to give us medicine. He also suggested restoring bi-weekly forums to solve the problem of "a wall, a ditch."

We Should Use People According to Their Talents
We Must Establish a Atmosphere of Communication
Chen Mingshu said when talking about the role of various organizations in universities that the leadership of schools today mostly relies on the "single whip" of the Party, the League, and the trade union to carry out work, which is worth studying. He believes that in the future, we should rely more on teachers and students. He also said that the Party committee system in schools should also be considered from various aspects in the future. However, he believes that there is a big difference between the Party group in government organs and the Party committee system in schools. The Party group should still exist in the future. It's just that the Party group should pay attention to some issues related to principles and policies in its future work, and discuss them with responsible non-Party cadres. When talking about the Party's cadre policy, he said that Party members have a clear working-class stance, but if they are "used for what they are not good at," they will ultimately not become "talents." Therefore, he hopes that the Party can "use its strengths" for leaders in schools. Finally, he talked about how to closely connect the Party's leading cadres with non-Party members. He said that he had participated in a heart-to-heart talk between Party members and non-Party members in a middle school and felt it was very good. He hopes that in the future, an atmosphere of communication between Party members and non-Party members can be established to eliminate the cold relationship between each other. At the same time, he hopes that the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference can restore bi-weekly forums.

Doctrinairism Makes People Passive
Analyze Specifically When Encountering Matters
Zhang Naiqi said in his speech: How to combine the Communist Party's non-interference in the internal affairs of democratic parties with mutual supervision? This issue needs to be studied. I believe that democratic parties can inspect the work of the United Front Work Department, and the United Front Work Department can also inspect the work of democratic parties. The Democratic National Construction Association welcomes the United Front Work Department to inspect. Next, Zhang Naiqi criticized the sectarianism and doctrinairism of the Communist Party. He said: To solve the problem of having position and power, we must overcome sectarianism. To do this, we must first distinguish between right and wrong, putting distinguishing between right and wrong in the first place, and putting interests and emotional relationships in the second place. He said that there are now some Party members who have one standard of right and wrong within the Party and another outside the Party, regarding "Party members protecting each other" as Party spirit. Someone criticized the Party, and it was clear that the opinions were correct, but the Party members did not admit it. Even if someone's opinions are in line with the Party's policies, it is difficult for non-Party members to insist on their opinions as long as the Party's responsible comrades shake their heads. Therefore, he believes that the Party must distinguish between right and wrong, otherwise it will not be able to achieve unity in the united front. He said: Only being selfless is Party spirit, and the incorrect understanding of Party spirit must be criticized. Speaking of this, Zhang Naiqi declared: However, I have position and power. In the Ministry of Food, the relationship between the Party group and me is normal. The Party group is in charge of ideological and political leadership, and I am in charge of administrative leadership. If the Party group and I have different opinions, they must be able to convince me before I agree. But my having position and power was obtained through struggle. Now, it can be said that the goal of unity has been achieved through struggle. Zhang Naiqi also criticized the sectarian activities within the Democratic National Construction Association. He said that this kind of sectarianism exists in tangible and intangible ways. Some people put on the airs of Party members, as if they represent the Communist Party in carrying out leadership.

When talking about the publicity and education work for the industrial and commercial circles, Zhang Naiqi believed that the doctrinairism in this aspect of work is very serious. There is a lot of doctrinairism in the People's Daily editorial on April 22, "Industrialists and Businessmen Should Continue to Transform and Work Actively." This editorial talked about the positive side of the industrial and commercial circles, and talked about three points on the negative side: negativity and inferiority complex, violating laws and regulations, stealing assets, and arrogance and complacency. Which of these three points is the main one is not very clear. Someone said to me: The percentage of illegal and criminal activities and theft of assets by private parties is definitely not higher than that of cooperatives and state-owned factories. It cannot be entirely blamed on the private sector for the negativity and inferiority complex of the industrial and commercial circles. It depends on whether the public sector has created the conditions. Secondly, the article unilaterally emphasizes the need to obey the leadership of the public sector, which is also problematic. For example, if a private party is the director of a factory, unilaterally emphasizing obedience to the leadership will inevitably result in having a position but no power. Furthermore, the article says that the industrial and commercial circles should undergo bone-deep transformation, which is not only doctrinairism, but also religious belief and mysticism. According to Taoist teachings, bone-deep transformation is to shed the mortal body and replace it with the bones of an immortal. Now, the industrial and commercial circles have already passed five tests (the war test, the land reform test, the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea test, the Five-Anti Movement test, and the socialist test). That is to say, bone-deep transformation has already been transformed. If we still need to undergo bone-deep transformation, it will only increase endless worries for the industrial and commercial circles. How can we not be negative and inferior? Therefore, he believes that a specific analysis should be carried out, especially for the negative side of the industrial and commercial circles, to clarify which are the main problems and which are the secondary problems? Only in this way can we prescribe the right medicine.

More than fifty people participated in this meeting. The forum will continue on the 9th.

### 倾听党外意见　推进整风运动  中共中央统战部邀各民主党派负责人举行座谈会

    倾听党外意见　推进整风运动
    中共中央统战部邀各民主党派负责人举行座谈会
    编者按　最近两个月以来，在各种有党外人士参加的会议上和在报刊上，很多党外人士关于人民内部矛盾的分析以及对党和政府所犯错误缺点的批评，对于各级党组织和各级人民政府改正错误，改进工作，有很大好处。在整风运动开始以后，党组织更应该继续征求党外人士的意见，不只可以邀请他们开座谈会，请他们畅所欲言地对工作中的错误缺点提出批评，而且还可以采用各别谈心的办法，更充分地听取党外人士的批评和意见。中共中央统一战线工作部昨天开始邀集各民主党派的负责人对统战工作提出意见，这是请党外人士帮助我们整顿作风的好办法。
    本报讯　从党在去年提出同民主党派“长期共存、互相监督”的方针后，党与各民主党派的关系中到底还有那些问题？在我们全党即将展开整风运动的时候，各民主党派和无党派民主人士希望我们通过整风解决那些思想上和工作中的问题？这是中共中央统战部在8日下午邀集各民主党派中央的负责人和无党派民主人士，举行座谈会的中心议题。
    统战部部长李维汉、副部长平杰三，先后就召集这次座谈会的目的、近年来检查党的统战工作的状况、当前党派关系上存在的一些问题，作了详细的说明。李维汉部长说，召集这个会的目的，就是请大家帮助我们进行整风，帮助我们改正缺点和错误。通过统一战线的方式来推动我们整风，这在我们党的历史上还是第一次。因此，希望大家多发表一些批评意见。
    平杰三副部长说，从去年3月到目前检查的结果来看，各地执行统战政策比以前有了进步。共产党和民主党派、无党派民主人士的关系比从前有了很大改进；各民主党派组织有了很大发展；关于宣传民主党派的活动方面也比过去作得多一些，但从今天的情况来看，很多方面都还存在不少问题。比如民主党派和无党派民主人士要求加强联系和帮助的问题，基层组织的党派关系问题等，都须要加以研究。
    在这次会上发言的，有中国民主同盟副主席章伯钧、九三学社主席许德珩、中国国民党革命委员会中央常委陈铭枢、民主建国会副主任委员章乃器等。民主同盟副主席罗隆基，在章伯钧副主席发言后，作了简短的补充发言。
    统战部多次征求意见
    只是没有下文
    章伯钧说，在这次座谈会召开以前，中国民主同盟中央常委会曾举行了扩大会议，就党与非党关系、民盟对中共中央统战部的意见等等问题进行了座谈。这次会上，有人说：几年来，有些民主党派的成员在国家事务中确实没有很好地发挥作用，他们是有能力的，但是没有条件。例如某机关的一个计划科长，因为是非党员，不能参加国家计划委员会召开的他本应参加的有关会议，很感苦恼。过去选拔留学生、学校留助教，都是首先考察政治条件，有些有能力、有专长的人，常被认为历史复杂而不能入选，非党人士出国学习的机会不多。非党干部要得到提拔很困难，党员提升得快，好像只有党员才有能力、有办法。关于有职有权问题，章伯钧说：有人说：职、权、责三者不可分，要做到非党领导人员有职有权，必须同时要非党人士负责，但是现在，在非党人士担任领导的地方，实际上是党组决定一切，都要党组负责。既然要党组负责，就不能不要权，这是形成非党人士有职无权的根本原因。因此，有人提出国家机关中党组和行政领导的职权要弄清楚，各机关的工作应由法定实行集体领导的行政机构来决定。
    在谈到对统战部意见的时候，章伯钧说：有人认为：统战部征求意见不止一次了，到今天还要人家提意见，有些人都不愿意提了，因为过去提的意见没有下文，没有交代。如去年统战部无准备地制定各民主党派干部制度，开了几次会征求意见，毫无结果。再如1950年统战部就曾强调有职有权问题，迄今七年，这个问题还没有很好解决。章伯钧还说：民盟中有人认为：党中央对统战工作从理论、政策到贯彻执行和宣传教育都重视得不够。有人认为，民盟中央“带病延年”，对长期共存方针无独立见解，也无具体办法，这点也是统战部对我们的“病”帮助不够，即互相监督不够，统战部也应该检查。还有人认为：统战部单靠开会提意见不解决问题，希望能够多花一点时间深入访问一下，个别交谈。深入访问时，不要只找正副主席、正副秘书长，还要找找下面的人。
    “带病”能否“延年”
    许德珩在谈到长期共存问题时说：有人说，民主党派害了“带病延年”症，我们九三学社带病是带病了，是否能够延年，还是个问题。为什么这样说呢？许德珩提出两个具体问题，他说：首先干部问题在九三学社总是很难解决，需要调来的人不能来，在职干部不安心工作。从去年到现在统战部只介绍来了一个人，但是，这个人到现在还在动摇。三年前曾介绍来一个青年人，后来走了，他说他是学历史的，非走不可。再有一个问题是：去年以来，九三学社有二百多人参加了中国共产党，这是进步。但是，他们入党以后，就要退出九三学社。南京九三学社的主任委员和杭州九三学社的主任委员入党后，都退出去了。我们就想：长期共存究竟怎样共存法？既然是长期共存，无论如何要有人来搞工作，无论如何要有组织成员呀！这个问题不解决，我们不敢检查统战工作。如何解决呢？许德珩说：现在我们呼吁统战部帮助，也就是带了病，请统战部给药吃。他还建议恢复双周座谈会，解决“一道墙，一道沟”的问题。
    应该量才用人
    要树立交谈风气
    陈铭枢在谈到高等学校中的各种组织的作用时说，当前学校的领导方面，多半是靠党、团、工会这“一条鞭”进行工作，这是值得研究的。他认为今后应该更多地依靠教师和学生。他还说，学校中的党委制，今后也应该从多方面进行考虑。但是，他认为机关中的党组同学校中的党委制有很大区别。党组今后仍然应该存在。只是党组在今后的工作中应该注意，对于一些有关方针、政策性的问题，要同党外的负责干部共同商量。他在谈到党的干部政策时说，党员有明确的工人阶级立场，但是如果“用非所长”终究不能成为“俊才”。因此，他希望党对学校中的领导人，能够做到“用其所长”。最后，他谈了如何密切党的领导干部与非党人士的关系问题。他说，他曾经参加某中学校的党员与非党人士的谈心会，感到很好。他希望今后能够树立起党员与非党人士交谈的风气，消除彼此关系冷冰冰的现象。同时，他希望全国政协能够恢复双周座谈会。
    教条主义使人消极
    遇事要作具体分析
    章乃器发言时说：共产党不干涉民主党派内政与互相监督如何结合？这个问题要研究。我认为民主党派可以检查统战部的工作，统战部也可以检查民主党派的工作，民建就欢迎统战部检查。接着，章乃器批评了共产党内的宗派主义和教条主义的思想作风。他说：要解决有职有权问题，必须克服宗派主义思想，这样就首先要明辨是非，把明辨是非放在第一位，把利害关系、感情关系放在第二位。他说，现在有一部分党员，党内一个是非，党外一个是非，把“党党相护”当作党性。有人批评了党，明明提的意见是对的，党员也不承认。有人提的意见尽管是符合党的政策的，但是只要党员负责同志一摇头，非党员要坚持意见也是很困难的。因此，他认为党要明辨是非，否则，就不能达到统一战线中的团结。他说：只有大公无私才是党性，对那种对党性的不正确的认识要批判。谈到这里，章乃器声明说：不过，我是有职有权的。在粮食部里，党组和我的关系是正常的，党组管思想政治领导，我管行政领导，党组和我有了分歧意见，要能说服我，我才同意。但是我这个有职有权，是斗争得来的。现在，可以说，经过斗争达到了团结的目的。章乃器还批评了民建内部的宗派主义活动，他说，这种宗派主义是有形无形存在着，有些人摆出党员的架子，好像代表共产党在执行领导。
    在谈到对工商界的宣传教育工作问题时，章乃器认为这方面工作中的教条主义很严重。4月22日人民日报“工商业者要继续改造，积极工作”社论中的教条主义就不少。这篇社论对于工商界积极的一面讲了，对于消极的一面讲了三点：消极自卑，违法乱纪、盗窃资财，骄傲自满，这三条究竟那一条是主要的，很不鲜明。有人对我说：私方违法乱纪、盗窃资财的百分比绝不比合作社、国营工厂来得多。说工商界消极自卑，也不能完全怪私方，还要看公方是否创造了条件。其次，文章中片面强调要服从公方领导，这也有问题，如私方当正厂长，片面强调服从领导，就必然有职无权。还有，文章中说工商界要进行脱胎换骨的改造，这不只是教条主义，而且是宗教上的信仰主义和神秘主义。照道教的说法，脱胎是脱凡胎，换骨是换仙骨。现在工商界已经过了五关（战争关、土地改革关、抗美援朝关、五反关、社会主义关），就是说，脱胎换骨的改造，也已经改造过了，如果还要脱胎换骨，只能使工商界增加无穷的忧虑，如何能不消极自卑？因此，他认为，应该进行具体分析，特别是对工商界消极的一面，要弄清哪些是主要的毛病？哪些是次要的毛病？这样才能对症下药。
    参加这次会议的有五十多人。座谈会将于9日继续举行。
