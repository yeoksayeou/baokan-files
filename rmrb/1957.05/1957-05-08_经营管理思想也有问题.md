Everyone's Discussion

    There are also problems with business management thinking
    Mao Xianzhi

    At present, there are indeed many unreasonable aspects to the reward system in factories and enterprises. According to a survey conducted by relevant departments in Dalian City in February of this year on nine state-owned factories, the following are the main problems: First, the scope of rewards is too broad. Many units do not base awards on the quality of work, but give everyone a reward as long as the factory completes its tasks. Second, bonuses are too high. Last year, the total bonus expenditure of many factories doubled or even increased several times compared to the previous year. Third, the distribution of bonuses is unreasonable, with management personnel receiving too much in bonuses. Fourth, the sources of bonuses are not unified, and many bonuses are duplicated with many different names. Therefore, some workers reflected: "The state has so much money! Bonuses are everywhere; if you don't look for them, they will find you."

    Why are these factories and enterprises so enthusiastic about material rewards? This requires examining the business management thinking of the enterprises. As everyone knows, one of the principles of socialist enterprise management is to combine politics and economics, and to use political work methods to solve problems in economic work. Therefore, in socialist enterprises, political and ideological work must be emphasized first, while also having appropriate material incentives. However, some people often forget this important principle and unconsciously become accustomed to using capitalist business management methods to lead production, unconsciously committing the error of economism. There was such a factory in Dalian that announced key production problems as topics, mobilized workers to find solutions, and stated under these topics how much bonus could be obtained for solving these key problems, calling it "Key Problem Bounty." Of course, mobilizing workers to solve key production problems is correct, but it is wrong to only promote how much bonus can be obtained for solving these key problems without promoting the political significance and contribution to the country of solving these key problems. Because this kind of propaganda has a very obvious economistic tint. Some workshop cadres do not educate workers to improve production and raise output, and promptly revise backward quotas, but instead help workers find ways to reduce quotas so that workers can earn more wages. Some people even conceal defective products and accidents for workers; and under the guise of "taking care of emotions," they use disguised methods to increase their wages. Now, almost every production activity in some enterprises has a reward. One unit has nearly forty kinds of regular and irregular reward items, such as: completing task awards, learning advanced experience awards, conscientiously implementing expert suggestions awards, strong sense of responsibility awards, working in the rain awards, and overcoming difficulties awards (which overlap with labor competition awards). In addition, there are also awards for long-term travel, awards for summarizing advanced personnel and work experience, as well as awards for the factory's ball games and track and field competitions, etc. There are so many different names that it is impossible to list them all in detail.

    This practice of talking about money at every turn easily blurs the consciousness of the working class and can cause workers to lose sight of their political struggle goals, which is very dangerous. Now, some factories have some workers with "three don'ts" and "four don'ts" situations (i.e., not doing anything that doesn't earn money, not doing anything difficult, etc.), which cannot be said to be unrelated to the leadership's neglect of political and ideological work and only paying attention to material rewards.

    Of course, I am not opposed to necessary material rewards, nor am I saying that the current reward system is all unreasonable, and even less am I saying that material rewards should be completely abolished, but rather that the chaos and unreasonable phenomena in the current reward work are indeed many and need to be improved. What is particularly important is that political and ideological work cannot be relaxed when conducting material rewards.

    Material rewards are related to the immediate economic interests of many people, so improving the reward system can only be done gradually. Material rewards should not be suddenly abolished, because doing so would encounter great ideological resistance. Only by strengthening political and ideological work, and through discussions by the masses themselves, can unreasonable things gradually be made reasonable.

    经营管理思想也有问题
    毛先智
    目前，工厂企业中的奖励制度的确有很多不合理的地方。据旅大市有关部门今年2月份对九个国营工厂的调查，发现以下几个主要问题：一、奖励范围过大，许多单位不是根据工作的好坏来评奖，而是工厂完成了任务就都有奖。二、奖金过多。去年许多工厂的奖金支出总额比前年增加了一倍，甚至好几倍。三、奖金分配不合理，管理人员得到的奖金太多。四、奖金来源不统一，而且很多奖金重复，名目繁多。因此有些工人反映：“国家的钱真多！奖金到处碰腿，你不找它，它会找你。”
    为什么这些工厂企业这样热中于物质奖励呢？这就要检查一下企业的经营管理思想。大家都知道：社会主义企业经营管理原则之一，是政治与经济相结合，要用政治工作的方法去解决经济工作中的问题。因此在社会主义企业里必须首先强调政治思想工作，同时也要有适当的物质鼓励。但是有些人经常忘记了这一条重要的原则，他们不自觉地习惯于采用资本主义的经营管理方法来领导生产，不自觉地犯了经济主义的错误。在大连就有这样一个工厂，他们把生产中的关键问题作为课题公布出来，发动工人设法解决，并在这一课题下面说明解决这一关键可以得多少奖金，名曰“关键悬赏”。当然，发动工人解决生产关键是对的，但是，只宣传解决这一关键可以拿多少奖金，而不宣传解决这一关键的政治意义和对国家的贡献，这就不对了。因为这种宣传有很明显的经济主义色彩。有些车间干部不是教育工人去改进生产，提高生产，及时修改落后的定额，而是去帮助工人设法削减定额，好让工人多拿几个工钱。有些人甚至替工人隐瞒废品和事故；并在“照顾情绪”的名义下，用变相的办法给他们增加工资。现在，有些企业差不多每一项生产活动都有奖励。有个单位定期和不定期的奖励项目就将近四十种之多，如：完成任务奖、学习先进经验奖、认真执行专家建议奖、责任心强奖、冒雨工作奖和克服困难奖（这都与劳动竞赛奖重复）。另外，还有长期出差人员奖和总结先进人员和工作经验奖，以及本厂球类竞赛和田径赛奖，等等。真是名目繁多，不及细载。
    这种动辄就讲钱的作法，容易模糊工人阶级的意识，会使得工人迷失自己政治斗争的目标，这是十分危险的。现在有些工厂有一部分工人有“三不干”“四不干”等情况（即不挣钱不干，活难了不干等等），这不能说和领导上忽视政治思想工作而只注意物质奖励没有关系。
    当然，我不是反对必要的物质奖励，也不是说现在的奖励制度都不合理，更不是说要一概取消物质奖励，而是说目前奖励工作中的混乱和不合理现象的确很多，需要加以改进。特别重要的是在进行物质奖励的时候，不能放松政治思想工作。
    物质奖励关系到许多人的切身经济利益，因此改进奖励制度只能逐步进行。不应把物质奖励一下突然取消。因为这样做会遇到很大的思想阻力。只有加强政治思想工作，通过群众自己讨论，才能使不合理的事情逐步做到合理。
