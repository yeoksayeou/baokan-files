    New Buildings in Moscow
    Large Television Station Under Construction
    In Moscow's Shabolovka district, a large television station is under construction. Its transmitter will emit electromagnetic fields ten to fifteen times stronger than those of Moscow's existing television stations. Once completed, the station will be able to broadcast its programs clearly to areas 110 to 120 kilometers away.
    The television station's transmission tower will be 500 meters high, exceeding the height of the famous Eiffel Tower in Paris by 200 meters. A set of power equipment and some radio engineering machinery will be installed in a specialized room at 270 meters on the tower for broadcasting color programs. This large television station will begin broadcasting in 1959.
    Europe's Largest Indoor Swimming Pool
    Moscow is building the largest indoor swimming pool in the country, and indeed in all of Europe. It will have a total building volume of approximately 80,000 cubic meters and will be able to accommodate 3,000 swimmers daily. There will be five swimming pools inside. Two swimming pools will be in the central hall: a large one for diving and a smaller one for practice. Two swimming pools specifically for competitions will be built in the side halls on either side. There will also be a children's swimming pool.
    Double-Decker Bridge Over the Moscow River
    A double-decker bridge spanning the Moscow River, measuring 1,800 meters long, is being built between the Lenin Central Stadium and Lenin Hills. This will be the largest bridge in Moscow and is part of the Frunzenskaya Embankment subway line project currently under construction. The upper level of the bridge will be 21 meters wide, allowing six buses to travel side by side simultaneously. The lower level of the bridge will accommodate the subway line and pedestrian walkways.

    莫斯科的新建筑物
    建设中的大电视台
    在莫斯科的沙鲍洛夫克，正在建造一个大电视台，它的发射机发出的电磁场强度将增加到莫斯科现有的电视台的十倍到十五倍。这个电视台建成后，离它一百一十到一百二十公里的地方将清楚地收到它的节目。
    这个电视台的播送台的铁塔有五百公尺高，比巴黎著名的爱菲尔铁塔还高二百公尺。在铁塔的二百七十公尺高处的专门室里要安装一套电源设备和一部分无线电工程机械，以便广播彩色节目。这个大电视台将在1959年开始播送节目。
    全欧最大的室内游泳场
    莫斯科正在修建一座全国最大的，也是全欧洲最大的室内游泳场。它的建筑容积共约八万立方公尺，每天可供三千人游泳。场内将有五个游泳池。两个游泳池在中央大厅内，一个大的供跳水用，一个小的供练习用。两个专供比赛用的游泳池建筑在两旁的侧厅内。另外还有一个儿童游泳池。
    莫斯科河上的双层大桥
    在列宁中央运动场和列宁山之间正在建筑一座长达一千八百公尺的横跨莫斯科河的双层大桥。这将是莫斯科最大的一座桥，它是目前正在建设的伏龙芝地下电车道工程的一部分。桥的上层宽二十一公尺，可以同时并行六辆公共汽车。桥的下层将铺设地下电车道和人行便道。　（新华社）（附图片）
