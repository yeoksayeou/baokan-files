According to the Workers' Daily: Recently, when discussing how to correctly handle contradictions among the people, trade union organizations at all levels raised some issues regarding understanding. The Workers' Daily reporter interviewed Comrade Lai Ruoyu, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, on the 7th, and he expressed his views on several questions raised by the reporter as follows:

    Are there contradictions between trade union organizations and the working masses?

    Q: In the discussion of correctly handling contradictions among the people, some people believe that since contradictions among the people are mainly contradictions between the masses and leaders, and trade unions are mass organizations, there are only contradictions between trade unions and enterprise leaders, and there are no contradictions between trade union organizations and the working masses. Do you think this view is correct?

    Comrade Lai Ruoyu said that it is true that trade union organizations are the organizations of the masses themselves. However, trade unions are in a position where, on the one hand, they are mass organizations that should represent the opinions of the masses, and on the other hand, they are not a single individual. They have a nationally unified organization, and as such, they should understand the overall situation, understand the current state of the country, represent the long-term interests of the masses, and patiently persuade the masses regarding certain incorrect opinions.

    Comrade Lai Ruoyu said that this position of the trade union is somewhat disadvantageous. In such a position, the trade union should understand the situation on both the leadership and the mass sides and play a regulatory role in the correct handling of contradictions among the people. However, the position of the trade union may lead to contradictions with both the leadership and the masses. If the trade union reflects the opinions of the masses and encounters bureaucracy on the part of the enterprise leadership, contradictions will arise. If the masses have certain incorrect opinions and the trade union conducts persuasive work, contradictions may also arise.

    Comrade Lai Ruoyu said that the issue is not whether contradictions will arise between trade union organizations and the working masses, but how to deal with possible contradictions. Comrade Lai Ruoyu emphasized the working method of trade unions standing on the side of the masses in carrying out activities. He said that trade unions should first stand on the side of the masses, support the correct opinions of the masses, and if the masses have incorrect opinions, they should also stand among the masses to persuade them. Only in this way will the masses be willing to listen to the opinions of the trade union.

    How should trade unions deal with mass disturbances?

    Q: In industrial and mining enterprises, the contradictions between the masses and the leadership sometimes develop into mass disturbances, and some even lead to strikes. How should trade unions deal with this situation? Some people believe that since trade unions represent the masses, they should speak for the masses, even if the opinions of the masses are wrong, the trade union should represent the interests of the masses. Others hold the opposite view. They believe that trade unions should not participate in mass disturbances, and trade unions should only persuade the masses regarding their incorrect opinions. Which of these two views is correct?

    Comrade Lai Ruoyu said that the opinions of the masses are of course not always correct, or completely correct. For the incorrect opinions of the masses, the trade union should persuade them. However, the core of the issue is that the trade union cannot be separated from the masses. If the trade union is separated from the masses, even if the masses have incorrect opinions, they will not listen to the trade union when it tries to persuade them. If it is not separated from the masses, the masses will be willing to listen to the trade union, and persuasion will be effective. We can see such a situation: if the trade union is separated from the masses, the masses will set aside the trade union when they cause trouble and establish another organization themselves, with the result that the trade union will not play a role. Comrade Lai Ruoyu said that therefore, the primary task of the trade union is to support the reasonable opinions of the masses. Only when the trade union has first fulfilled its responsibility in this regard can it persuade the incorrect opinions of the masses.

    Comrade Lai Ruoyu then made a detailed analysis of the opinions of the masses. He said that when we say that the masses may have incorrect opinions, we must never think that all the opinions of the masses are incorrect, or that they are often incorrect. On the contrary, we must see that many of the opinions of the masses are correct and reasonable. According to statistics from many factories and mines in the past, more than 60% of the opinions of the masses are about work, such as opinions on labor organization, raw material use and supply, production equipment, and organizational systems. These opinions should be respected and supported. In the political sphere, the masses often have some opinions and demands. These opinions and demands often involve the democratic rights of the masses. For example, if the masses criticize bureaucracy and are retaliated against, this is an infringement of the democratic rights of the masses, and the trade union should support the masses' demand to avoid retaliation. In terms of wages, welfare, recreation, and sports, the demands of the masses are often not too high. Many opinions in this area do not even involve increasing wages and benefits, such as opinions on unsanitary canteens, poorly run nurseries and clinics, and unreasonable wages, which also require the support of the trade union. The same is true for demands for cultural and technical learning. Most of these opinions are reasonable and correct. The trade union should support them, this is the main point. Only by supporting the correct opinions of the masses can the trade union be said to represent the interests of the masses, have faith in the working masses, and when something happens, the masses will listen to you.

    Comrade Lai Ruoyu also talked about how to deal with the incorrect opinions of the masses. He said that as for the incorrect opinions of the masses, should the trade union unconditionally speak for the masses? Of course not. In this case, the trade union should persuade them. He said that the issue is not whether persuasion is necessary, but how to persuade. The trade union should stand among the masses to persuade the masses. He said that it should be seen that even incorrect opinions and excessive demands have their reasons, that is, there are reasonable factors. Even if this reasonable factor is only a little bit, the trade union should first affirm it and be full of sympathy. Then, the trade union's persuasion of the incorrect part is likely to be accepted by the masses.

    How should incorrect opinions be persuaded? Comrade Lai Ruoyu said that patient persuasion, not suppression, the method should be to inspire the masses to discuss and solve the problem themselves. What if the problem still cannot be solved after discussion, and the masses still insist on their original opinion? Comrade Lai Ruoyu said that even in this case, the trade union should not leave the masses. The trade union has the responsibility to put forward the opinions of the masses to the relevant parties on the one hand, and on the other hand, if the trade union still believes that the opinions of the masses are incorrect, it should continue to express its attitude to the masses and continue to persuade the masses. From the perspective of the trade union organization, the majority opinion of the masses is of course not always correct, but the trade union has the principle of democracy, and the minority should obey the majority. Trade union cadres can only retain their own opinions and slowly persuade the masses in the work process. Only in this way can the trade union both adhere to correct opinions and avoid being separated from the masses. Of course, it is not easy to do this, but it is not impossible. Although there is little experience in this area, there is still some.

    Trade union work can also "contend"

    Q: Can the "Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" be mentioned in trade union work?

    Comrade Lai Ruoyu said that any organization has two different types of work. One is executive work, and the other is research work. For executive work, whatever is decided is done. Research work advocates freedom of thought and free discussion. In this sense, it can also be called "contention." However, this is different from the "Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" in academia, because it cannot form a school of its own.

    There are also contradictions within trade union organizations.

    Q: Are there contradictions within trade union organizations? How should these contradictions be understood?

    Comrade Lai Ruoyu said that the current problem of trade union organizations is mainly to clarify the position of trade unions in correctly handling contradictions among the people. As for the internal affairs of trade union organizations, like any other organization, there are of course contradictions. There are also issues of upper and lower levels, leadership and being led, and issues of departments and regions within the trade union. But these are internal issues of the trade union organization, which are daily work issues, and can be studied separately from the issue of correctly handling contradictions among the people.

    Finally, Comrade Lai Ruoyu talked about the fact that if trade unions are to play their due role in correctly handling contradictions among the people, the most important thing is the democracy of trade unions.

    The fundamental problem at present is to promote democracy

    He said that for trade unions, one of the fundamental problems at present is democracy. With democracy, it can be reflected that the trade union is the organization of the masses themselves. He also said that in order to adapt to the current situation, trade unions should solve two major problems well: the relationship with the administration and the relationship with the Party.

    He said that in terms of the relationship with the administration, in the past, the focus was on the unity side, and the difference side was not seen. Therefore, whenever something happened, they always stood with the leadership and could not represent the opinions of the masses. This simplistic view of the problems within the people often made the working methods of trade unions rigid and inflexible, and unable to play a full regulatory role between the masses and the leadership. This should be changed.

    In terms of the relationship with the Party, Comrade Lai Ruoyu said that in the past, the problem of trade unions having to accept the leadership of the Party was solved, which was correct, but it did not pay enough attention to the fact that as a mass organization, trade unions must carry out their own independent activities under the policy and ideological leadership of the Party. Only by carrying out its own independent activities can it show its own role.

    Comrade Lai Ruoyu said that in the past, we did not solve these two problems well, and the role of trade union organizations was not fully utilized. Therefore, the so-called "trade unions are dispensable" problem occurred. The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao put forward the issue of correctly handling contradictions among the people, and trade union organizations should better play their due role.

    工会怎样对待人民内部矛盾？
    在领导和群众之间起充分的调节作用
    支持群众的合理意见说服不正确的意见
    据工人日报讯　各级工会组织最近在讨论如何正确处理人民内部矛盾问题的时候，提出了一些有关认识上的问题。工人日报记者于7日访问了全国总工会主席赖若愚同志，他就记者提出的几个问题发表意见如下：
    工会组织和工人群众之间有没有矛盾？
    问：在讨论正确处理人民内部矛盾问题中，有人认为，人民内部矛盾既然主要是群众与领导之间的矛盾，工会是群众组织，因此只存在工会与企业领导之间的矛盾，工会组织和工人群众之间不存在矛盾，你认为这种看法对吗？
    赖若愚同志说，工会组织是群众自己的组织，这是不错的。但是工会是处在这样的地位，一方面它是群众组织，应该代表群众的意见，另一方面，它不是一个单一的个人，它有全国统一的组织，作为这样一个组织，它又应该了解全局，了解国家当前的状况，代表群众的长远利益，对群众某些不正确的意见，进行耐心的说服。
    赖若愚同志说，工会的这种地位是有些不好处的。处在这样的地位，工会应该了解领导和群众两方面的情况，发挥工会组织在正确处理人民内部矛盾中的调节作用。但是，工会组织所处的这个位置，对领导和对群众两方面都可能发生矛盾。工会反映群众意见，遇到企业领导上有官僚主义，要发生矛盾；遇到群众有某些不正确意见，工会进行说服工作，也可能发生矛盾。
    赖若愚同志说，问题并不在于工会组织和工人群众之间会不会发生矛盾，重要的是如何对待可能产生的矛盾。赖若愚同志强调工会要站在群众这一方面进行活动的工作方法，他说，工会应该首先站在群众方面，支持群众的正确意见，群众有不正确的意见，也应站在群众当中来说服群众。只有这样，群众才愿意听工会的意见。
    工会怎样对待群众闹事？
    问：在工矿企业中，群众和领导之间的矛盾有时发展成群众的闹事，有的甚至引起罢工，碰到这种情形，工会应该如何对待？有人认为，工会既然是代表群众的，就应该替群众说话，即令群众的意见是错误的，工会也应代表群众利益；有人则持相反的见解，他们认为，工会不应参加群众闹事，对群众的不正确意见，工会只有进行说服。这两种说法究竟那一种对？
    赖若愚同志说，群众的意见当然并不一定经常正确，或者全部正确。对于群众的不正确意见，工会应该说服。但是，问题的中心，是工会不能脱离群众。如果工会脱离了群众，就是碰到群众有不正确的意见，工会要说服时，群众也不会听；如果不脱离群众，群众才愿意听工会的话，说服也才能起作用。我们可以看到这样的情形，工会如果脱离群众，群众闹事时，就会把工会撇开，自己另外成立一个组织，其结果是工会反而不起作用。赖若愚同志说，所以，工会首要的任务是在于支持群众的合理意见，只有当工会首先尽到这一方面的责任以后，才有可能说服群众的不正确意见。
    赖若愚同志接着就群众的意见做了详细的分析。他说，当我们说群众中可能有不正确的意见的时候，绝不能认为，群众意见全部都不正确，或者经常都不正确。相反，必须看到，群众的很多意见都是正确的合理的。根据过去许多厂矿的统计，群众意见中，往往60％以上是关于工作方面的，如对劳动组织，原材料使用、供应，生产设备以及组织制度等方面的意见，这些意见是应该受到尊重和支持的。在政治方面，群众也常常有一些意见和要求。这些意见和要求，往往涉及群众的民主权利。如群众批评官僚主义遭到打击报复，这是侵犯群众的民主权利，群众要求避免打击报复，工会也应该支持。在工资、福利、文娱、体育方面，群众的要求往往也不是过高的，这方面的许多意见甚至并不牵涉到增加工资福利的问题，如对食堂不卫生，托儿所、医务所办的不好，工资不合理等意见，也需要工会的支持。在文化、技术学习方面的要求也一样。这些意见大都是合理的、正确的。工会应该支持，这是主要之点。只有支持了群众的正确意见，工会才算是代表了群众的利益，在工人群众中才有信仰，遇到事情，群众才会听你的。
    赖若愚同志又谈到如何对待群众的不正确的意见。他说，至于群众的不正确意见，是不是也要工会无条件地替群众说话呢？当然，不是的。碰到这种情形，工会应该说服。他说，问题不在于是否应该说服，重要的是如何说服。工会应该站在群众之中来说服群众。他说，应该看到，即令是不正确的意见和过高的要求，也有它的原因，也就是说，也有合理的因素。这种合理的因素即令是只有一点点，工会也应该首先肯定它，并且要满怀同情。然后，工会对不正确部分的说服才可能为群众接受。
    对于不正确的意见应该如何说服呢？赖若愚同志说，耐心说服，不是压服，方式应该是启发群众自己讨论，自己解决。如果经过讨论，仍然不能解决，群众仍然坚持原来的意见怎么办？赖若愚同志说，就是在这种情况下，工会也不应该离开群众。工会有责任，一方面把群众意见向有关方面提出，另一方面，如果工会还认为群众意见是不正确的，就应该继续向群众表明自己的态度，继续向群众进行说服。从工会组织方面来说，群众中的多数意见当然有时也不一定都正确，但是工会有民主的原则，少数应该服从多数，工会干部只能保留自己的意见，在工作过程中慢慢说服。只有这样，工会才能既坚持正确意见，又不致脱离群众。当然，要作到这一点是不容易的，但是，也并不是做不到。这方面的经验虽然少，也还是有的。
    工会工作也可以“争鸣”
    问：工会工作中能不能提“百家争鸣”？
    赖若愚同志说，无论那一个组织，都有两种性质不同的工作。一是执行性的工作，一是研究性的工作。执行性的工作，决定怎么办就怎么办了。研究性的工作提倡自由思想，提倡自由讨论，从这个意义上说，也可以叫“争鸣”。但是，这和学术上的“百家争鸣”有区别，因为这不能自成一个学派。
    工会组织内部也有矛盾。
    问：工会组织内部有无矛盾？应该如何认识这些矛盾？
    赖若愚同志说，工会组织当前的问题主要是要弄清工会在正确处理人民内部矛盾中所处的地位。至于工会组织内部，和其他任何组织一样，当然也是有矛盾的。工会内部也有上下级、领导与被领导之间的关系问题，有条条块块的问题等等，但这是工会组织内部的问题，是日常工作上的问题，可以不和正确处理人民内部矛盾问题纠缠在一起来研究。
    最后，赖若愚同志谈到，工会要在正确处理人民内部矛盾中发挥应有作用，最重要的是工会的民主问题。
    当前根本问题是发扬民主
    他说，对工会来说，当前的根本问题之一是民主。有了民主，才能体现出工会是群众自己的组织。他又说，工会要适应当前的形势，应该很好地解决两大问题：和行政的关系问题以及和党的关系问题。
    他说，在和行政的关系方面，过去强调了一致的一面，看不见差别的一面，因此，遇事总是和领导站在一头，不能代表群众意见。对人民内部的问题的这种简单化看法，常常使工会工作方法生硬和僵化，不能在群众和领导之间起充分的调节作用。这是应该改变的。
    在和党的关系方面，赖若愚同志说，过去解决了工会必须接受党的领导的问题，这是正确的，但是，却没有充分注意作为一个群众组织，工会在党的政策思想领导下还必须开展它自己的独立活动。只有开展自己的独立活动才能显出它自己的作用。
    赖若愚同志说，过去我们在这两个问题上都没有解决好，工会组织的作用没有充分发挥，因此，便发生了所谓“工会可有可无”的问题。党中央和毛主席提出正确处理人民内部矛盾问题，工会组织就应该更好地发挥它的应有作用。
