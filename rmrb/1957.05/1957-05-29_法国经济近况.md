Recent Economic Situation in France

    Foreign Exchange Reserves

    At the beginning of last year, France had 394 billion francs (approximately US$1.126 billion) in foreign exchange reserves. At the beginning of this year, it had 100 billion francs. According to statistics on April 18 this year, foreign exchange reserves were only 23 billion francs. Marcel Béronk, a member of the Finance Committee of the French Republic Senate, said that at the current rate of expenditure, France's foreign exchange reserves will be exhausted in May.

    Foreign Trade

    Last year, France's total imports were 1,943.5 billion francs, and its total exports were 1,588.6 billion francs, resulting in a deficit of 354.9 billion francs (approximately US$780 million). This huge deficit is unprecedented in French history. The deficit in March this year was 51.5 billion francs, and the deficit in April increased to 53.8 billion francs. The foreign trade deficit in the first four months of 1957 more than doubled compared with the same period last year, from 101.9 billion francs to 221 billion francs.

    Agricultural Situation

    Last year, agriculture suffered a poor harvest, with only 5.7 million metric tons of wheat produced (one metric ton equals 2,000 Chinese catties). This year's grain is insufficient and requires the import of a large amount of grain, which will further expand the foreign trade deficit. According to the French Ministry of Agriculture's plan, it is expected to produce 10 to 11 million metric tons of wheat this year, and the situation may be better. The frost in April this year has greatly affected this year's grape production.

    Industrial Production

    Last year, the Suez Canal was closed, and France's oil supply was tight. This year, after the partial resumption of oil transmission from the Iraqi oil pipeline and the lifting of Saudi Arabia's embargo on France, the oil supply has improved. Since April 1, kerosene can be purchased freely, and gasoline rationing may be lifted in July this year. After the implementation of gasoline rationing last winter, automobile production declined. Currently, small car production has rebounded somewhat. In March this year, steel production was 13,000 tons less than the 1,222,000 tons in October last year, but steel production in the first quarter of this year increased by 6.8% compared with the first quarter of last year.

    Emergency Measures

    In order to cope with financial difficulties, the French Mollet government has taken a series of austerity measures: restricting imports, encouraging exports, and restricting credit, etc. From April 11, the bank interest rate was raised from 3% to 4%, and the securities loan interest rate was raised from 4.5% to 6%. Before resigning, it also put forward a so-called savings plan to cut this year's government budget by 250 billion francs (military expenditure reduced by 100 billion francs, civil expenditure reduced by 150 billion francs); and increase tax revenue by 150 billion francs.

    法国经济近况
    外汇储备
    去年年初法国有三千九百四十亿法郎（约合11.26亿美元）的外汇储备，今年年初还有一千亿法郎，今年4月18日统计，外汇储备只剩下二百三十亿法郎。法国共和国参议院财政委员会委员马赛尔·贝朗克说，照目前的开支速度，法国的外汇储备在5月将会消耗殆尽。
    对外贸易
    去年法国的进口总值是一万九千四百三十五亿法郎，出口总值是一万五千八百八十六亿法郎，逆差达三千五百四十九亿法郎（约合7.8亿美元），这样巨额的逆差在法国历史上是空前的。今年3月份的逆差是五百一十五亿法郎，4月份的逆差更增至五百三十八亿法郎。1957年头四个月对外贸易逆差比去年同一时期增加一倍多，即从一千零一十九亿法郎增加到二千二百一十亿法郎。
    农业情况
    去年农业歉收，麦子只生产了五百七十万米吨（一米吨等于中国二千斤），今年的粮食不够，需要进口大量粮食，这就更加扩大对外贸易逆差。据法国农业部计划今年可产一千至一千一百万米吨的麦子，情况可能要好一些。今年4月的寒霜对今年葡萄的产量大有影响。
    工业生产
    去年苏伊士运河封闭，法国的石油供应紧张。今年自伊拉克油管部分恢复输油和沙特阿拉伯取消了对法国的禁运以后，石油的供应已有改进。从4月1日起，煤油可自由购买，汽油配给制可能在今年7月取消。在去年冬天实行汽油配给制后，汽车生产下降，目前小汽车产量有些回升。今年3月，钢的产量比去年10月的一百二十二万二千吨还少一万三千吨，但今年第一季钢的产量比去年第一季增加了6.8％。
    紧急措施
    法国摩勒政府为了应付财政困难，曾采取了一系列的紧缩措施：限制进口、鼓励出口和限制信贷等。从4月11日起，把银行利率从3％提高到4％，证券垫款利率从4.5％提高到6％。在辞职前，还提出了一个所谓节约计划，要把今年的政府预算削减二千五百亿法郎（军事费用削减一千亿法郎，民政费用削减一千五百亿法郎）；同时增加一千五百亿法郎的税收。
