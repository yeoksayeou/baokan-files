    纪念英国诗人布莱克和美国诗人朗弗罗
    中外诗人举行国际诗歌晚会
    据新华社2日讯　四百多位中外诗人今晚在北京举行国际诗歌晚会，纪念世界文化名人英国诗人布莱克和美国诗人朗弗罗。
    诗人肖三在致开场白的时候，对出席晚会的许多外国诗人表示感谢。他引述朗弗罗著名的诗句说：“让大家彼此成为兄弟吧，把弓箭埋到地下去……”。
    晚会在多种语言的吟诵声和轻松的笑声中进行。中国诗人们听到了用英文和中文朗诵的布莱克和朗弗罗的名诗，外国诗人也听到诗人们吟诵中国古诗和古词。
    应邀出席晚会的苏格兰著名诗人格里夫在会上介绍了布莱克和朗弗罗，并且朗诵了“在贫民窟中的沉思”等三首。西班牙著名诗人阿尔贝蒂也朗诵了他在北京的近作“向齐白石致敬”和“京剧”。这位老诗人在赞美“京剧”的这首诗中歌唱道：“啊，人民的心胸里，充满和平和欢乐，一切都是亮光，一切都是诗歌，……”。
    诗会在激发着人们的诗兴。罗马尼亚作家协会书记米·贝纽克朗诵的“路旁的苹果树”被诗人邹荻凡即席译成中文，在会上朗诵出来。中国文学艺术界联合会主席、老诗人郭沫若热情洋溢地朗诵了他完成不久的新作“‘五一’天安门情景”。
