    老挝副国王对成立联合政府表示乐观
    要求尽快实行双方去年签订的协议
    新华社河内27日电　万象消息：在寮国战斗部队集结区桑怒省访问以后回到万象的老挝副国王佩差拉23日向记者说，他对于老挝双方就分歧意见进行协商，并且成立一个联合政府的前途是乐观的。
    佩差拉对寮国战斗部队的印象很好。“这个省里完成的工作和从来感觉不到存在着外国意识形态这一事实”，使他获得了深刻的印象。他还注意到寮国行政机构的活跃和效率。
    佩差拉说，他已经在22日写信给王国政府领导人和议会领袖，要求尽快实行双方在去年签订的协议。他说，这是这个国家经过十二年的倾轧以后获致统一的唯一方法。
    去年12月28日老挝首相富马和寮国战斗部队代表苏发努冯签订了一项关于成立联合政府的协议。但是，这个协议到现在还没有实行。佩差拉希望双方都收回各自的条件，扫除求得解决的障碍。
