    This newspaper reports that The Chinese Performing Arts Research Association convened a symposium on the morning of May 4 to discuss how to implement the "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" policy in performing arts work. More than 40 people attended, including performing arts artists from Beijing and cadres from relevant departments.

    At the meeting, the artists spoke enthusiastically, pointing out the existing problems in performing arts work and criticizing some leading departments for not paying enough attention to performing arts work.

    Everyone believes that performing arts is a small flower among a hundred flowers. To make it flourish and develop, cultivating the second generation is a very important issue. There are some difficulties in taking apprentices now, and the leadership's assistance and support in this regard is not enough. Gao Yuanjun, a famous Shandong Kuaishu performer, suggested establishing performing arts schools or performing arts training classes to train new performing arts actors.

    Secondly, everyone believes that in order to make the flower of performing arts bloom luxuriantly, attention should be paid to the excavation and sorting out of traditional repertoire. Cai Liangui, a Xihe Dagu performer, said: "The Xihe Dagu sung now is just one tune. The old predecessors sang it differently. There are not many old artists who sing Xihe tune in Beijing now. If it is not rescued, it will be lost. The old predecessors themselves are also very anxious." Gao Fengshan of the Beijing Performing Arts Troupe No. 3 said: "In the past, there were ten elders in the Beijing performing arts circle. Now there are eight elders left. The younger ones are in their sixties, and the older ones are in their eighties and nineties. They have a lot of knowledge in their minds. If they are not excavated and sorted out in time, the loss will be great." Several artists hope that the central cultural departments can hold a national performing arts festival, which can unearth a lot of good things. It is not enough to rely on individuals to do the work of excavating repertoire. They said that all kinds of dramas have festivals, but performing arts has never held a national festival. They hope the leadership will consider this issue.

    Regarding the issue of poaching talent, everyone also raised many opinions. Gu Rongfu of the Performing Arts Troupe said: "State-owned theaters and radio stations often use conditions such as 'public medical care' and 'guaranteed party membership' to attract actors, which is not good." Gao Fengshan said: "Poaching talent is like picking the flower bud. If you want to dig, you should dig up the whole pot, otherwise the flower will not bloom well. The old artists feel very sad about others poaching talent. They say that it is not easy to train apprentices for several years. Who will we rely on when we get old? I hope the leadership will add more fertilizer and water to the performing arts, so that the flowers will bloom well, and don't pick the flower buds."

    Everyone also raised many opinions on the issue of performing arts creation. They believe that the leadership's encouragement and support for performing arts creation in the past has not been enough. Ping Shu (storytelling) artist Duan Xingyun said that they spent more than a year writing eight sections of Ping Shu about the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, about 40,000 words, and after handing them over to the leading department, they disappeared without a trace, which dampened everyone's writing mood. I hope the leadership will provide more support and encouragement for creation in the future. Gao Yuanjun hopes that writers can write more performing arts performance works in the future. Zhang Shanzeng of the Performing Arts Troupe No. 3 expressed dissatisfaction with the current formulaic and conceptualized crosstalk programs. He said that although there are many crosstalk programs, very few can be selected as regular performances. Some crosstalks are published in newspapers and periodicals across the country. From form to content, they are almost all the same, the themes are not wide, the content is not fresh, and the form is monotonous. In fact, there are many styles of crosstalk. The old predecessors of crosstalk once had the saying of "ten kinds of crosstalk" and "eight kinds of crosstalk." Now it seems to have become "one kind." He hopes that the Performing Arts Research Association will introduce a variety of crosstalks to the masses.

    Some artists hoped in their speeches that the government would pay attention to improving the performance environment for artists, so that the art of performing arts can have better development opportunities. They also criticized the bureaucratic style and the attitude of some cadres of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture of looking down on performing arts artists.

### 曲艺艺人座谈百花齐放方针  培养第二代　挖掘传统曲目　鼓励曲艺创作

    曲艺艺人座谈百花齐放方针
    培养第二代　挖掘传统曲目　鼓励曲艺创作
    本报讯　中国曲艺研究会，5月4日上午召开座谈会，讨论在曲艺工作中如何贯彻“百花齐放、百家争鸣”方针的问题。到会的有北京市曲艺艺人和有关部门的干部共四十多人。
    会上艺人们踊跃发言，指出目前曲艺工作中存在的问题，并批评了某些领导部门不重视曲艺工作。
    大家认为曲艺是百花中的一朵小花，要使它繁荣发展，培养第二代是一个很重要的问题。现在带徒弟有一些困难，领导方面对这方面的帮助和支持很不够。著名山东快书演唱者高元钧建议设立曲艺学校或曲艺训练班，来培养新的曲艺演员。
    其次，大家认为要使曲艺之花开得茂盛，应当重视传统曲目的挖掘和整理工作。西河大鼓演唱者蔡连贵说：“现在唱的西河大鼓只是一个调，过去一些老前辈唱的就不是这样。现在唱西河调的老艺人在北京的已不多了，如不抢救，就要失传。老前辈自己也很着急。”北京市曲艺三团高凤山说：“过去北京市曲艺界有十老，现在还剩八老，小的六十多岁，大的八九十岁，他们肚子里有很多东西，假若不及时挖掘、整理，损失就大了。”好几个艺人都希望中央文化部门能举行一次全国曲艺会演，这样能挖出不少好东西，挖掘曲目的工作单靠个人去作是不够的。他们说，各种剧都有会演，就是曲艺没有举行过一次全国会演，希望领导考虑这个问题。
    关于挖角问题，大家也提了不少意见。曲艺团顾荣甫说：“国营剧团和广播电台等，往往以‘公费医疗’和‘保证入党’等条件来拉演员，这是不好的。”高凤山说：“挖角等于把花蒂蒂摘了，要挖，就全盆挖去好了，否则花还是开不好。老艺人对别人挖角感到很难过，他们说带徒弟几年不容易，我们以后老了依靠谁呢？希望领导上对曲艺多上粪、浇水，使花开得好，不要摘花蒂。”
    对曲艺创作问题，大家也提了不少意见。认为领导过去对曲艺创作的鼓励和支持不够，评书艺人段兴云说，他们曾花了一年多时间写出八段关于太平天国的评书，约四万多字，交给领导部门后，就石沉大海没有下文，打击了大家的写作情绪。希望领导以后对创作多支持多鼓励。高元钧希望作家们今后能多写一些曲艺演唱作品。曲艺三团张善增对目前相声节目的公式化、概念化表示不满。他说，相声节目虽然很多，但能挑出来作为经常演出的却很少。全国各地报刊发表了一些相声，从形式到内容差不多全都一样，题材不广泛，内容不新鲜，形式单调，其实，相声的样式是很多的，相声老前辈曾有“十样相声”“八样相声”的说法，现在似乎就成了“一样”了。他希望曲艺研究会多向群众介绍一些各式各样的相声。
    有的艺人在发言中，希望政府注意改善艺人的演唱环境，使曲艺艺术能有更好的发展机会。他们并对北京市文化局某些干部的官僚主义作风和轻视曲艺艺人的态度提出了批评。
