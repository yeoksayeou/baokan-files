    Li and Miao Autonomous Prefecture Builds Mechanized Sugar Factory

    (By our reporter) The Tengqiao Mechanized Raw Brown Sugar Factory, a local state-owned enterprise in the Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, was rebuilt into a modern sugar factory last September using some dilapidated equipment left over from the Japanese occupation period. The entire construction cost was only 300,000 yuan, saving 350,000 yuan compared to building a new one. The picture below shows the overall view of the production workshop. (Fu Shujin)
