Representatives from Industrial and Commercial Circles Expose Internal Conflicts Between Public and Private Interests in Joint Ventures

(Our Newspaper) News – The United Front Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Eighth Office of the State Council jointly held a symposium for industrial and commercial circles yesterday morning. The attendees included representatives from various provinces and cities participating in the National Federation of Industry and Commerce Secretary-Generals Conference in Beijing, leading figures from the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce and the China Democratic National Construction Association, such as Chen Shutong, Zhang Naiqi, Hu Zi'ang, Wu Xuezhi, Le Songsheng, and Bi Mingqi, as well as leading figures from the Beijing and Tianjin Municipal Federations of Industry and Commerce.

The meeting was presided over by Minister Li Weihan. At the meeting, Han Zhiming, Ma Chunlin, Li Yizan, Xie Wei'an, Peng Liuan, and Li Zhongping successively made sharp criticisms of the work of the Party and the government.

Han Zhiming said: Private personnel should also be rewarded and criticized

Han Zhiming, Deputy Secretary-General of the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce, said: First, the work of arranging jobs for private personnel after overall joint ownership was not done well. Shanghai originally planned to complete the arrangements in one month, but it was not completed by the end of the year because it could not be balanced. Some people said that in the past, industrialists and businessmen sought profits, but after joint ownership, they could not get profits, so they were very interested in "fame." Those who came forward were all arranged, and the people below asked: Why are the heads of various professional companies all members of the Federation of Industry and Commerce? They have won "fame," but they cannot do practical work, only hanging an empty name, while those who were promised arrangements have not yet been arranged, so some people below say: We carried them up in sedan chairs and then ignored us. The arrangement of people is not based on work needs, but on rewarding merits. This is not good for the transformation of industrialists and businessmen themselves. Now the government proposes that the transformation of industrialists and businessmen should be based on enterprises, which is correct. But those backbone elements are different. They are active outside all day long, and many of them even hold more than a dozen positions, leaving after opening a meeting, which makes them detached from the masses.

Second, some people advocate that no public representatives should be sent to joint ventures, so that the enthusiasm of private personnel can be brought into play. I don't think this is good for the transformation of private personnel, nor is it good for work. Take myself as an example, I am not sure that I can do a good job without the help of public representatives. In the enterprise, whether he is a public person or a private person, as long as he assumes a position, those resolutions passed through democratic centralism can be handed over to him for execution. If the execution is good, praise him, and if the execution is not good, educate him. But now some enterprise leaders are private, and mistakes can be forgiven, which is not right. Also, some people criticize private personnel severely when they make mistakes in their work, killing them with one blow. This is also not right.

In public-private joint ventures, the interest rate is now fixed at five percent. I think there should only be a working relationship between staff members, and there should be no class relationship. Mentioning class relations makes it difficult to bring into play the enthusiasm of private personnel. He believes that private personnel should also be rewarded and criticized, promoted and demoted, in order to bring into play the enthusiasm of private personnel.

Third, directors should also be arranged, and the remuneration issue for capitalist agents should also be resolved. In recent years, many of them have hoped to transition to the working people, and they should be able to see the future.

He said that when some provinces and cities went to Shanghai to mobilize factories to move, they talked about it in a flowery way, saying that the food was good and the accommodation was good, but after moving to the destination, the reality was not the same. For example, there was a Western clothing store that moved from Shanghai to Beijing. When they were in Shanghai, the father and son each took a salary of more than 200 yuan per month, but they were unwilling to go. The relevant departments in Beijing said that if there were problems with life, they could temporarily borrow money, but they were rated at a salary of 78 yuan per month and were not allowed to borrow. They felt very difficult. He believes that what was said originally should be done, and the government should deal with this issue, otherwise it will affect the government's prestige.

Ma Chunlin said: Joint ventures have fostered a grand and ostentatious style

Ma Chunlin, Deputy Secretary-General of the Shenyang Federation of Industry and Commerce, said: Our private personnel are grateful to everyone for the policy of having power in their positions and are satisfied with the Party and the government, but they have opinions on the specific implementing personnel. In the past, in small factories with 30 or 40 people, private personnel had surplus energy in management. Now that they have been merged into large factories with 300 or 400 people, private personnel feel as if they are in the mountains and do not know where they are. The public cannot boldly use us, and the public comes up with some subjectivity, the Party and the administration come up with some dogmatism, and the trade union and the Communist Youth League come up with some sectarianism. As a result, there is a situation where there is something to say but nowhere to say it, and there is something to say but nowhere to say it. The phenomenon of being obsequious in work is not individual among private personnel.

There is also a phenomenon that there is no way to use energy in terms of proposing rationalization proposals. Shenyang has been ruled by imperialism for a long time and has been deeply oppressed. Private personnel have always had the habit and experience of careful calculation. In the trial production of new products, the improvement of productivity, and the technical measures plan, they can generally do more with less money. Now that the enterprise has expanded, the grand and ostentatious style has gradually grown in the enterprise. Generally, factories have eight departments, and each workshop has eight staff members under the department system. The organization is huge, and the phenomenon of overstaffing is very serious. Private personnel have made comments, but what they get is not respect, but sarcasm, saying that they are petty, have a workshop style, and do not understand socialist construction.

In terms of public-private cooperation, he believes that under the leadership of the Party, starting from work, small meetings, even two-person meetings, or meetings with both public and private parties should be held. There should be disputes at the meetings, and some issues should have conclusions. Only in this way can we achieve mutual respect, mutual help, and mutual learning. Planning meetings and production-related meetings convened by the Party branch, etc., should also invite private personnel to participate. When carrying out specific work tasks, we must achieve specific leadership, division of labor, and clear responsibilities.

Li Yizan said: Currently, the upper levels of the industrial and commercial circles are making a fuss about fame and status, and the middle and lower levels are worried about the difficulties of life.

Li Yizan, Deputy Director of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce, said: First, in Beijing, the main problem with the relationship between public and private cooperation is that the public does not trust the private enough, so it is difficult for private personnel to bring their enthusiasm into play. The public and private parties are together every day, and they do not interact with each other except for work, as the saying goes: "The hemp pole beats the wolf, both sides are afraid." The public and private parties are wary of each other, so they cannot solve problems in their work through mutual heart-to-heart talks. Second, the public has a low level of business and uses cadres only emphasizing politics and not business. Third, there is infighting among production, supply, and sales personnel within the enterprise, and there is also infighting between bureaus and bureaus, making it difficult for private personnel to work. Because they have a sense of inferiority, they dare not express their attitude when they see these situations.

At present, the situation in the industrial and commercial circles in Beijing is that the upper levels are making a fuss about fame and status, and small and medium-sized industrialists and businessmen are worried about the difficulties of life. In the past, there was a saying in the industrial and commercial circles: "If there is business, the shopkeeper will not starve to death." Now it is different. The means of production have been invested, and loans from relatives and friends have stopped. Last year, they could still borrow money, but this year, borrowing has become tight, and some departments do not even lend at all. He believes that for small and medium-sized industrialists and businessmen, helping them solve their living problems is the key to bringing their enthusiasm into play.

Xie Wei'an said: Jiangsu's industrial and commercial circles are afraid of being labeled as class dissidents after "speaking out."

Xie Wei'an, Deputy Secretary-General of the Jiangsu Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce, said: At present, private personnel still dare not "speak out" boldly in the "letting a hundred flowers bloom" atmosphere. They are worried:

Are there conditions for "speaking out"? Which ones can be "spoken out"? Which ones cannot be "spoken out"? To which level should it be "spoken out"? Is it only "spoken out" among upper-level representatives, and not "spoken out" among middle and lower levels? Where should it be "spoken out"? When should it be "spoken out"? Is it a gust of wind, or is it regular? Private personnel have a lot to say, and some of them cannot be understood by upper-level representatives. The reason why they dare not speak out publicly is that they are afraid of being labeled as backward elements, afraid of being discriminated against in their work after "speaking out," and afraid that they will be labeled as class dissidents once there is a movement. These concerns are mainly due to the Party's bureaucracy, sectarianism, and the personal style of the Party members. Some people in the industrial and commercial circles reflect that the public personnel respect the private personnel more than they trust them, and feel cold when they come into contact with Party members.

For many years, all parties have not given enough support to the Federation of Industry and Commerce, from the central government to the directly subordinate superiors. For example, the telephone charges of the Jiangsu Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce are not charged according to the charging method for people's organizations, but according to the charging method for private enterprises. It is said that this is the regulation of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications. I think this matter reflects the view of the Federation of Industry and Commerce. Cadres of the leading departments in some places can go to the Federation of Industry and Commerce to issue orders, and the cadres of the Federation of Industry and Commerce can be used at will, and some can be decided according to their opinions. This situation needs to be changed.

The cadres of the Federation of Industry and Commerce are originally the same as the cadres of the state organs, but the actual treatment is different. For example, the Wuxi Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce has more than 40 full-time cadres, and no one has led their studies so far, and some welfare problems have not been taken care of, which has a great impact on bringing their enthusiasm into play.

Peng Liuan said: Private personnel have two hats, two burdens, and one depression.

Peng Liuan, Secretary-General of the Hunan Federation of Industry and Commerce, said: The relationship between public and private in Hunan Province is superficially polite, but they cannot treat each other with sincerity. Now private personnel feel that they have two hats, two burdens, and one depression. The two hats are the hat of being afraid of being said to be disobedient to leadership and the hat of being afraid of being said to be unwilling to accept transformation. The two burdens are fear of making mistakes. There are three reasons for this: First, the boundaries between what is capitalism and what is socialism are not clear, and it is easy to make mistakes; second, now the enterprise is big, and I do not have the ability, and I am afraid that I will not be able to do my job well; third, we are being transformed, and no one supports us if we make mistakes, no one sympathizes with us, and we cannot afford to take responsibility for mistakes in our work. The second burden is fear of being rectified. Before the Five-Anti Movement after liberation, all those who dared to make suggestions were rectified. Now, those who behave obsequiously in front of the public are arranged well; those who love to make suggestions are disobedient to the leadership, and the arrangements are also different. One depression is: the current situation of industrialists and businessmen is that they go to work in the enterprise, and go home after work. The old habits of the past have been cancelled, but new habits have not been developed. Party members and the Communist Youth League cannot get close, and even the trade union cannot get close. Some people even go to workers' homes to visit relatives and friends, but the public representatives do not allow it. Some people say that the relationship between relatives and friends has become cold after public-private joint ownership.

He said that there are objective reasons for the above situation. First, there is not enough respect for private personnel. Some meetings are attended by Party members, and some private personnel serve as section chiefs and deputy section chiefs, but many meetings cannot be attended. Some people serve as leaders of study groups, but have never heard a report, how can they lead the study? This affects the enthusiasm of private personnel. Second, private personnel do not get the support of the enterprise, the Party, and public opinion. For example, if a private person has an invention, the newspaper publishes it as the worker's. A member of the China Democratic National Construction Association made a rationalization proposal, which has been successfully tested and has reached the international level, but the Ministry of Light Industry has a very low evaluation of this matter. Third, the treatment is unequal. For example, in terms of welfare, the families of private personnel cannot go to the hospital for treatment like the families of public personnel and workers. During the Spring Festival, public personnel and workers have overtime pay for working overtime, but private personnel cannot get overtime pay for working overtime. Public personnel regard themselves as transformers. When getting along, they always emphasize class relations. Fourth, in terms of personnel arrangements, representative figures have been arranged, and some ordinary private personnel also have skills, but they have not been arranged. When it comes to arrangements, it is about political conditions and background, which shows that there is serious sectarianism among the relevant leaders. There are several relationships in public-private joint ventures now. One is the public-private relationship, one is the class relationship, and one is the Party-masses relationship. Class relations can be mentioned when studying, but class relations should not be mentioned in production, rationalization proposals, etc. In public-private joint ventures, public personnel should listen to the opinions of private personnel. Of course, public personnel also listened to some meetings in the past, but after listening, they completely adopted a negative attitude. Some even do not want to listen. Some private personnel say: It is not that we are not active, we cannot make the decision. We are the little daughter-in-law, "it is difficult for the little daughter-in-law to cook rice."

He also said that do not put hats on private personnel indiscriminately, but should distinguish between right and wrong, and analyze specific problems specifically. Some newspapers mentioned that the industrial and commercial circles are sleeping for five years and transforming for two years. The industrial and commercial circles have a lot of opinions on this statement after the fixed interest rate. The year before last, we came to Beijing to attend a meeting and listened to a report by Chairman Mao, which solved many problems for us ideologically, making us tearful with gratitude. After listening to it, we were willing to say anything, which proves that reasoning is better than putting hats on people, and putting hats on people does not solve the problem. He hopes that public personnel will reach out to unite with private personnel, and become one with them in life, have heart-to-heart talks, and talk about everything, so that people can feel warm, which is good for work.

Li Zhongping said: The work of unified arrangement and overall consideration has not been done well.

Li Zhongping, Secretary-General of the Sichuan Federation of Industry and Commerce, said: Now private personnel think: Joint ownership is not as good as cooperation, and cooperation is not as good as working alone; this mountain looks higher than that mountain. Why is this? In addition to the fact that the thinking has not been resolved, the main reason is that the work of unified arrangement and overall consideration has not been done well. In the same type of enterprises in a region, some people have high wages and some people have low wages. Before the wage reform in Sichuan Province, private personnel knew that they would get a 13% increase, and some of them prepaid the money, but later they did not reach this number, and the people who were in debt were very dissatisfied. Although through ideological education, some people know that life welfare must be gradually increased on the basis of developing production, there are still many people who cannot understand, and think that the government has issued blank checks. Of course, wages are determined according to national policies, but those who have difficulties in life should be helped to solve them and maintain their minimum living standards. The director (private personnel) of an electromechanical factory in Chengdu has technology and has a monthly income of about 40 yuan, with nine people in his family, averaging 7 yuan per person. Last year, there was a long branch, and the difficulty was not too great; this year, there is no long branch, and life is very difficult. He asked the Federation of Industry and Commerce to solve the problem, and the Federation of Industry and Commerce pushed it to the professional company to solve, pushing each other, and only lent 20 yuan. Later, difficulties occurred again, and he asked the professional company, and the professional company asked him to find a way by himself. He said: "My capital has been handed over, and I am in the factory, where can I find a way?"

This symposium will continue.

    工商界代表揭发合营企业内部公私矛盾
    本报讯　昨天上午，中共中央统战部和国务院第八办公室联合召开工商界座谈会。出席的有正在北京参加全国工商联秘书长会议的各省市代表，全国工商联和民主建国会的主要负责人陈叔通、章乃器、胡子昂、吴雪之、乐松生、毕鸣岐等。以及北京、天津两个市工商联的主要负责人。
    会议由李维汉部长主持。在会上先后有韩志明、马春霖、李贻赞、谢惟安、彭六安、李仲平等六人对党和政府的工作进行了尖锐的批评。
    韩志明说：对私方人员也应该有奖励有批评
    上海工商联副秘书长韩志明说：第一，全面合营以后，对私方人员的安排工作做得很不好。上海原来是打算一个月安排完毕的，后来到年底也没安排完，原因是摆不平。有人说过去工商界图利，合营后利得不到了，对名很有兴趣。那些出头露面的人都安排上了，下边就问：各专业公司的负责人为什么都是工商联的委员？“名”他们是争到了，但不能作实际工作，只挂了个空名，而原来许愿要安排的，至今还没有安排，因此下边有些人就说：我们抬轿子把他们抬上去了，就不管我们了。安排人不按工作需要，而是论功行赏。这样作对工商业者本身的改造也没有好处。现在政府提出工商业者改造以企业为基地，这是正确的。但那些骨干分子则不然，他们整天在外面活动，有很多人甚至身兼十几职，开会开个头就走了，这就使他们脱离群众。
    第二，有人主张在合营企业里不派公方代表，就可以发挥私方人员的积极性了。我认为这样作不但对私方人员的改造没有好处，对工作也没有好处。拿我个人来说，我就没有把握在没有公方代表帮助下把工作做好。在企业里，不论他是公方人员，还是私方人员，只要是他担负了职务，那些经过民主集中以后的决议，就可以交给他执行。执行的好就表扬，执行的不好就教育。而现在有些企业领导人员是私方，犯了错误可以谅解，这是不对的。也有些人一见私方人员工作上犯了错误，就狠狠的批评，一棍子打死。这也是不对的。
    在公私合营企业里，现在是五厘定息，我认为工作人员之间只有工作关系，不应有阶级关系。提阶级关系，不容易发挥私方人员的积极性。他认为对私方人员也应有奖励有批评，有升级有降级，才能发挥私方人员的积极性。
    第三，董事也应给予安排，资方代理人的酬劳问题也应解决。近年来他们中很多人都希望向劳动人民过渡，应该使他们看到前途。
    他说，有些省市到上海动员迁厂的时候讲的天花乱坠，吃的好，住的好，但迁到目的地以后，实际却不是那么回事。例如有个从上海迁到北京的西服店，在上海时他们父子两人每月拿二百多元薪水，就不愿去，北京有关部门说生活有问题可以暂借款，但给他评了个每月七十八元工资，也不准借支了。他们就感到很困难。他认为原来怎么讲的就该怎么做，政府对这个问题应加以处理，否则影响政府威信。
    马春霖说：合营企业滋长了好排场作风
    沈阳市工商联副秘书长马春霖说：我们私方人员对有职有权的政策是人人感激的，对党和政府是满意的，但对具体执行的人员有意见。过去，三、四十人的小工厂，私方人员在管理上有余力，现在合并成三、四百人的大工厂，私方人员大有身在此山中，云深不知处的感觉。公方又不能大胆使用我们，再加上公方来点主观，党和行政来点教条，工会和团来点宗派，于是有话欲说无地，有言欲发无处的境况就出现了。工作上唯唯诺诺的现象在私方人员中不是个别的。
    在提合理化建议方面也有有劲使不出的现象。沈阳被帝国主义统治时间较长，受的压迫较深，私方人员一向有精打细算的习惯和经验，在试制新产品、提高生产率和技术措施计划上，一般都能做到少花钱多办事。现在企业扩大了，好排场作风在企业中逐渐滋长。一般工厂都设有八大科，每个车间又在科的系统下设有八大员，机构庞大，人浮于事的现象非常严重。私方人员提过意见，但得到的不是尊重，而是讽刺，说小家子气，作坊作风，不懂社会主义建设。
    在公私共事方面，他认为应在党的领导下，从工作出发，开小型的，甚至两个人的、或者公私双方在一起的会议，会议要有争论，有些问题要有结论。只有这样，才能做到互相尊重，互相帮助，互相学习。计划会议和党支部召开的有关生产会议等，也应该找私方人员参加。在具体执行工作任务时，要做到具体领导，分工负责，职责分明。
    李贻赞说：目前工商界上层闹名誉地位，中下层愁生活困难
    北京市工商联副主任委员李贻赞说：第一，在北京，公私共事关系问题主要是公方对私方信任不够，所以私方人员很难发挥积极性。公私双方每天在一起，他们除了工作以外互不往来，正如俗话所说：“麻杆儿打狼两头怕”，公私互存戒心，这样，他们就不能通过互相谈心，来解决工作中的问题。第二，公方业务水平低，使用干部只重政治不重业务。第三，企业内部产、供、销人员扯皮，局与局之间也扯皮，弄得私方人员很难工作。因为他们有自卑感，看到这些情况就更不敢表示态度了。
    目前，北京工商界的情况是上层闹名誉地位，中小工商业者愁生活困难。过去工商界有句俗话：“有买卖饿不死掌柜的”，现在不同了，生产资料入股了，亲友借贷停止了，去年还可以借支，今年借支紧了，有的部门甚至根本不借。他认为对中小工商业者来说，帮助他们解决生活问题是发挥他们积极的关键。
    谢惟安说：江苏工商界怕“鸣”以后，被说是阶级异己分子
    江苏省工商联副秘书长谢惟安说：目前私方人员在“百花齐放”声中还不敢大胆“放”。他们顾虑：
  “放”有没有条件？哪些可以“放”？哪些不可以“放”？放到哪一级？是否只在上层代表人物中“放”，中、下层不“放”？在什么地方“放”？放到什么时候？是一阵风，还是经常的？私方人员有不少话要讲，有些话不是上层代表人物所能理解的。他们有些话所以不敢公开讲，是怕给戴落后分子的帽子，怕“鸣”了以后在工作中遭到歧视，怕一旦有运动来时会把他们说成阶级异己分子。这种种顾虑主要是由于党有官僚主义、宗派主义，同党员的个人作风也有关系。有些工商界的人反映，公方人员对私方人员尊重有余，信任不足，和党员接触感到冷冰冰的。
    好多年来，各方面对工商联的支持是不够的，从中央一直到直属上级都是如此。例如江苏省工商联的电话费，就不是按人民团体的收费办法收费，而是按私营企业的收费办法收，据说这是邮电部的规定。我认为这件事就反映了对工商联的看法。有些地方的领导部门的干部可以到工商联去发号施令，对工商联的干部可以随便使用，有些是可以按他们的意见决定。这种情况需要加以改变。
    工商联的干部，本来是与国家机关干部一样，但实际待遇却不同。例如无锡市工商联有四十多个脱产干部，至今没人领导他们的学习，有些福利问题也没有人管，这对发挥他们的积极性很有影响。
    彭六安说：私方人员有两顶帽子、两个包袱、一个苦闷
    湖南工商联秘书长彭六安说：湖南省的公私关系，表面上客客气气，就是不能以诚相见。现在私方人员感到有两顶帽子、两个包袱、一个苦闷。两顶帽子就是怕人家说不服从领导的帽子、怕别人说不接受改造的帽子。两个包袱，一个是怕犯错误。原因有三，一，什么是资本主义，什么是社会主义，界限不清，搞不好就犯错误；二，现在企业大了，自己没有本领，怕工作做不好；三，我们是被改造的，错了没有人支持，没有人同情，工作中出了错担当不起。第二个包袱是怕挨整。在解放以后五反以前，凡是敢于提意见的都挨了整，现在凡是在公方面前表现唯唯诺诺的人安排的都好；凡是爱提意见就是不服从领导，安排的时候也两样。一个苦闷是：工商业者目前的情况是上班在企业，下班就回家，过去旧的生活习惯取消了，但新生活习惯没养成，党团员接近不了，工会也不能接近。甚至有人到工人家去看看亲友，公方代表不让去。有人说公私合营以后亲友间的关系都冷淡了。
    他说，造成上述情况，是有客观原因的。第一，对私方人员尊重不够，有些会议都是党员参加，私方人员有的担任科长副科长，但有很多会都不能参加。有的人担任学习小组长，但从来没有听过报告，如何去领导学习呢？这就影响了私方人员积极性。第二，私方人员得不到企业和党以及社会舆论的支持。例如有个私方人员有了一件发明创造，但报纸发表时却说是工人的。有个民建会员提了一件合理化建议，已经试验成功，并达到国际水平，但轻工业部对这件事评价很低。第三，待遇不平等，例如福利方面，私方家属生病就不能同公方人员、工人家属一样到医院去治疗。春节时，公方、工人加班都有加班费，但私方人员加班却拿不到。公方人员以改造者自居。相处时总强调阶级关系。第四，在人事的安排方面，有代表性的人物都安排了，一般私方人员有的也有技术，但未得到安排。一提安排就是政治条件，出身，这说明有关领导上是存在着严重的宗派主义的。现在公私合营企业里有几个关系。一个是公私关系，一个是阶级关系，一个是党群关系。阶级关系，搞学习时可以提，在生产，合理化建议等方面就不应讲阶级关系。在公私合营企业里，公方人员应该听取私方人员的意见，当然，过去有些会议上公方人员也听了，但听了以后完全采取否定的态度。有的甚至听都不愿听。有些私方人员说：不是我们不积极，我们作不了主。我们是小媳妇，“小媳妇难为有米炊”。
    他又说，对私方人员不要乱扣帽子，要明辨是非，具体问题，应具体分析。有些报纸提到，工商界就是五年睡觉，二年改造，定息后工商界对这种说法很有意见。前年我们来北京开会听了毛主席一次报告，从思想上给我们解决了很多问题，使我们感激得流泪，听了后我们有什么话都愿意说出来，这证明讲道理比扣帽子好，扣帽子就不解决问题。他希望公方人员伸出手来团结私方，在生活上也打成一片，要谈心，要什么都谈，才能使人感到温暖，对工作才有好处。
    李仲平说：统一安排、统筹兼顾的工作没有做好
    四川工商联秘书长李仲平说：现在私方人员认为：合营不如合作，合作不如单干；这山望着那山高。为什么这样呢？除了思想没解决外，主要是统一安排、统筹兼顾的工作没有做好。在一个地区同一类型企业中，有些人工资高，有些人工资低。四川省工资改革前私方人员知道加13％，有的就预支了钱，但后来没达到此数，负债的人很不满意。虽然经过思想教育，有的人知道生活福利必须在发展生产的基础上逐步增加，但仍有很多人想不通，认为政府开了空头支票。当然，工资是根据国家政策制定的，但是生活有困难的应该帮助解决，维持他们的最低生活。成都市一个机电厂厂长（私方人员），有技术，每月收入四十元左右，家里九口人，平均每人七元，去年有长支，困难不太大；今年没长支了，生活很困难。他找工商联解决，工商联推给专业公司解决，互相推，才借给二十元。以后又发生困难，找专业公司，专业公司要他自己想办法。他说：“我的资本都交了出来，我人在工厂，叫我到哪去想办法呢？”
    这个座谈会还将继续进行。
