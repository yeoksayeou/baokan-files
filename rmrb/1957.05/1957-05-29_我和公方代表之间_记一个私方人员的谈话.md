    My Interactions with the Public Representative
    —A Private Sector Person's Account
    By Our Reporter Ye Jianyun
    On the morning of May 23rd, I went to the Beijing Electrical Industrial Company to find Pei Ren.

    Pei Ren is the manager of this company. I was looking for him to understand this matter: He was originally the public representative of the joint public-private Chaoyang Motor Factory, and I heard that he was doing a good job in public-private relations. I planned to ask him about his experiences in this area.

    There was still some time before work started, and Pei Ren arrived. He was a man in his thirties, wearing blue cloth clothes. After he understood my intentions, he earnestly replied, "It's all just groping around, not really experience; some things I'm not even satisfied with myself, not worth mentioning."

    I sat in his office for more than two hours, and he told me only about other people's affairs. For example, how the employees actively completed production tasks after the factory became a joint venture; what shortcomings the private personnel had overcome over the years, and what progress they had made; how the enterprise's total output value was rising in a straight line... As for himself, he only talked about a few shortcomings. He said that when he first entered the factory, he was not proactive enough in uniting the private sector, only believed the opinions of the workers, and did not pay much attention to the opinions of the private sector; later, in some work, he demanded that the private sector use the management methods and principles of socialist enterprises to handle problems, which was somewhat too demanding. ...

    Just as I was feeling embarrassed by this kind of modest conversation, he stood up and slowly said to me, "We have many shortcomings, and we are currently rectifying them, and haven't had time to examine them yet; now our company's deputy manager is the capitalist representative from the Chaoyang Factory, and we are old colleagues. If necessary, you can listen to his criticism of me." Originally, I wanted to say goodbye, but hearing this new clue, I went to find the deputy manager with renewed interest.

    The company's deputy manager is named Bai Yue, one of the founders of the private Chaoyang Motor Factory, and also the private representative after the joint venture. He is also a People's Representative of Beijing, a standing committee member of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce, and a member of the China Democratic National Construction Association.

    The topic of our conversation was: My Interactions with the Public Representative.

      "Speaking of the past Chaoyang," Bai Yue said to me, "I thought of two sentences to describe it: A factory with a thousand holes and a hundred sores, a person with many worries and ailments. With 370,000 yuan in capital, it was almost lost by the eve of the joint venture in May 1954; wages could not be paid, taxes could not be paid, and people thought there was no hope, some left and some scattered. I was the manager of the factory, and in order to keep this façade up, I developed lung disease before long." This manager, who had been involved in business since his twenties, first complained about a lot of suffering in the past, and then said, "In those years of private operation, the word 'worry' was always on our minds; now, the word 'joy' accompanies us. People are energetic, and the lung disease has also calcified. Compared with before the joint venture, the number of employees in the Chaoyang Factory has increased by several hundred, and the output value has increased by several times. Thinking of the past, and comparing it with the present, a businessman who has been running a factory for many years, seeing the factory he raised with his own hands flourishing like this, can he not be happy? All this is the benefit of the joint venture, and the merit of the public representative.

    "I think, in the past few years, the biggest benefit the public representative has given us is helping us to transform ourselves." After some recollection, he continued, "Take the relationship between me and Pei Ren, for example. When he first entered the factory, the general affairs department prepared a separate office for him. In our private sector's view, the public representative is the leader, inevitably has some activities, and also has some documents that need to be kept, giving him a room is not excessive. However, as soon as Pei Ren entered the factory, he moved his desk to sit with me. It seems like a small matter, but it left a deep impression on us private sector personnel.

    "Of course, my relationship with Pei Ren was not always good, and can be roughly divided into several periods. At first, we had not worked together, and there was mutual wariness. When the public sector encountered something and consulted with me, I assumed that they were already prepared, and the consultation was just for show, always thinking that the public sector didn't trust us. Originally, I was responsible for finance. Once, in order to test him, I suddenly suggested to Lao Pei that I was not capable enough and asked to give up managing finance. Seeing that I was managing it well, why would I suddenly propose to quit? So Pei Ren talked to me. Seeing that his attitude was kind and his tone sincere, I told him what was in my heart. I said: 'Managing finance is a heavy responsibility, and all the ins and outs of the factory are borne by one person. This kind of thing should be managed by a Party member.' Pei Ren said to me seriously: 'You are the deputy director, a leader in the factory. There is no issue of the government not trusting you here, but rather you not trusting the government.' I thought about these words for a long time afterwards, and the more I thought about it, the more I felt that the public representative was right. In fact, in the early days of the joint venture, the workers were not convinced that private sector personnel were participating in leadership, and they went to the public representative for everything. Pei Ren was very bold and decisive in handling these issues. If it wasn't his responsibility, he would push it back, regardless of whether it was the private or public sector, whoever was in charge would be the one to handle it. Over time, the workers' views slowly changed.

      "In the second period, there were more opportunities for contact between the two sides. Generally speaking, concerns were dispelled, but there were still many things in our hearts that we were not convinced about. We people, having read a few more years of books in the old society, were a little stronger in terms of culture, and also had some old experience and old baggage, sometimes feeling that we were very capable. Lao Pei had only studied for four years and worked in the countryside for a long time. However, his principles were very strong and he paid attention to his methods. For example, when I was in charge of finance, once a worker came to me to borrow money, and I said that this was the system and could not be borrowed. Later, this worker scolded me. At that time, I was both angry and resentful. I thought: Blame no one but myself for wearing this capitalist hat. If it were the public representative, you wouldn't dare to do this. Later, Pei Ren investigated and said that I had only done half of the job right, and the other half was wrong. I couldn't understand it, how could there be a mistake in enforcing the system? Pei Ren said: 'It's right not to lend to workers who borrow without reason in order to comply with the system, but not long ago, a private sector person borrowed from you, and you lent to him, that's not right.' I thought about it carefully, and realized that there was a reason for the worker to scold me. First of all, I had violated the system myself. In handling this matter, Lao Pei criticized me and also educated the workers. Although he criticized me, our relationship became closer than before. After that, I was not as confident as before when encountering problems, and I checked myself first. I also trusted Lao Pei even more.

      "The third period was the period of actively demanding to learn how to manage socialist enterprises. Democratic management and the mass line are things that managers or factory directors of private enterprises could not possibly consider. However, after the joint venture, the nature of the enterprise changed, and without learning these things, one could not be a good leader of the enterprise. In this regard, Lao Pei helped me a lot. I was also in charge of general affairs in the factory. I managed the food, but I would rather eat in a small restaurant than eat in the canteen. Sometimes Lao Pei would accompany me to eat in a restaurant once or twice. He didn't eat in the restaurant just to accompany me, but used the opportunity to persuade me to care about the food of the employees, and suggested that I eat in the canteen so that I could understand the quality of the food at any time. Later, I ate in the canteen a few times and personally felt that the workers' opinions about the poor food were correct. At this time, Lao Pei suggested drawing capable cadres to the kitchen to provide specific help, and specifically named Li Peizhi from the General Affairs Section. At the time, I was very dissatisfied. Li Peizhi was a college student, and he was also active and willing to work. Isn't it a waste of talent to call such a person to do trivial things? Later, this comrade went to the kitchen, and in a few days, the food was improved, and the workers were very satisfied, and they wrote wall newspapers and letters to praise Li Peizhi. Through this incident, I learned two things. One point is that I usually see the mass viewpoint as very abstract. In fact, doing a good job of what the masses are most concerned about is a very good mass viewpoint. Another point is that in the past, I always thought that doing a sensational thing was glorious, but now I realized that no matter how small the work is, if it is done well and the masses support it, it is glorious.

      "Lao Pei often went to the workshop, but he did not assign us the task of going to the workshop. I was responsible for the supply of raw materials. Once, when discussing the material supply situation of the third branch factory, I affirmed that the material was not a problem. At the time, Lao Pei didn't say anything, and took my hand and said, 'Let's go and take a look!' As soon as we entered the door of the third branch factory, the branch factory director said, 'Director, Deputy Director are here! The material problem is a big one!' I was confused: the material had already been approved and allocated to them, why were they still stopping work and waiting for materials? Later, after inquiring, I learned that the material sent to the third branch factory had been mistakenly sent to the first branch factory. Afterwards, Lao Pei said to me: 'We leaders can't do a good job if we just stay in the office. We have to go to the workshop more in the future.' Lao Pei is the kind of person who puts on a raincoat and goes around the workers' dormitories whenever it's windy or rainy to see where it's leaking and where it needs to be repaired. In winter, the more windy and snowy it is, the more often he runs to see if the stove's chimney is installed and whether there will be problems. Lao Pei once said: 'The more you run among the workers, the deeper your feelings for the workers become.' At the time, I couldn't understand what he meant, but after going down a few times myself, I realized its benefits and took the initiative to go down from then on.

      "There are so many things to learn from the public representative, and I have indeed learned a lot from being with Lao Pei. Once, our factory accepted a batch of distribution box production tasks. The drawings were designed by our factory and had been seen and approved by Party A. Later, Party A said that the products were not suitable for use and requested repairs. At this time, the private sector personnel felt that the responsibility was not ours and were unwilling to repair them. Lao Pei said to everyone: Party A is an amateur, we are professionals, we also have a responsibility if we are wrong; besides, the purpose of our production is to serve socialist economic construction, and if Party A can't use it well, it will be detrimental to construction. He only said these few words, but he fully explained the superiority of our joint venture enterprise and greatly improved everyone's understanding."

    Finally, as our conversation was about to end, Bai Yue told me that Pei Ren was learning arithmetic from him, and they were also studying political economy together.

    When we parted, he summarized the above and said: "In the past few years, I have personally encountered a lot of setbacks in my work. Looking back, encountering a setback is equivalent to breaking down capitalism once, which is equivalent to establishing socialism once. Without the help of the public representative, these breakdowns and establishments would either not break down or establish, or there would be breakdowns without establishments. These few years of joint venture are equivalent to us private sector personnel taking a big class. The Party and the government have given us lectures, and the public representative is the tutor in the classroom."

    我和公方代表之间
    ——记一个私方人员的谈话
    本报记者　叶剑韵
    5月23日早晨，我到北京市电器工业公司去找裴仁。
    裴仁是这个公司的经理，我找他为的是了解这样一件事情：原来他是公私合营朝阳电机厂的公方代表，听说他在公私关系方面搞得很好。打算请他谈谈这方面的经验。
    距上班还有一段时间，裴仁来了。这人三十多岁，穿的蓝布衣服。他问明我的来意后，恳切地回答说：“完全是摸索，谈不上经验；有些自己也不满意，不值得一提。”
    我在他的办公室里坐了两个多钟头，他告诉我的，尽是些别人的事情。譬如说，这个厂子在合营以后，职工们怎样积极地完成生产任务；私方人员几年来克服了那些缺点，有了那些进步；企业里的生产总值是在怎样直线上升……。至于他自己，只讲了几个缺点。他说，他刚进厂的时候，对团结私方不够主动，只相信工人的意见，对私方的意见还不大重视；后来，在某些工作上，又要求私方用社会主义企业的管理方法和原则来处理问题，要求得过高了一些。……
    我正在为这种谦虚的谈话感到为难的时候，他却站了起来，慢条斯理地对我说：“我们的缺点很多，现在正在整风，还没有来得及检查；现在我们公司的副经理是朝阳厂的资方代表，我们是老同事。需要的话，你可以听听他对我的批评。”本来我是想告辞的，听到这个新的线索，又兴致勃勃地找副经理去了。
    公司的副经理名叫柏岳，是私营朝阳电机厂的创建人之一，也是合营后的私方代表。他还是北京市的人民代表，又是北京市工商业联合会的常务委员，民主建国会的会员。
    我们谈话的题目是：我和公方代表之间。
      “提起过去的朝阳，”柏岳对我说：“我给它想了两句话：千孔百疮的厂，多愁多病的人。三十七万资金，到1954年5月合营前夕，差不多快赔光了；工资开不出，税款交不上，同人们认为没希望了，走的走散的散。我是厂子里的经理，为了把这个门面撑下来，不多久就搞出了肺病。”这位从二十多岁就投身于企业界的经理，先诉了过去一大堆的苦，接着又说：“私营的那几年，头上离不了‘愁’字；现在伴着我们的是‘欢’字。人精神了，肺病也钙化了。与合营前比较，现在朝阳厂从业人员增加了好几百，产值增加了好几倍。想起过去，比一比眼前，一个办工厂办了多少年的工商业者，看到自己一手扶养大的厂子这么欣欣向荣，心里能不乐不欢吗？这一切是合营的好处，是公方代表的功劳。
    “我想，这几年来，公方代表给我们最大的好处是帮助我们进行了改造。”经过一番回忆后他继续说道。“拿我和裴仁的关系来说吧。他刚进厂，总务部门为他单独准备了一个办公室。这在我们私方人员看来，公方代表是领导人，免不了有些活动，同时还会有些文件之类的东西需要保管，给他一间房，也不为过分。可是，裴仁一进厂，就把桌子搬来和我坐在一起了。看来这是小事，却给我们私方人员留下了深刻的印象。
    “当然我和裴仁之间，也不是什么时候都相处得很好的，大体可以分为这样几个时期。一开始，彼此之间没有共过事，互有戒备。公方遇事和我商量时，满以为人家早就准备好了，商量不过是聋子的耳朵装装门面，总认为公方不信任我们。原来我是分工管财务的，一次，为了试探一下，我突然向老裴提出自己能力不够管不了，要求不管财务了。裴仁见我管得好好的，为什么无缘无故提出不干呢？于是就找我谈话。我见他态度和蔼，语气诚恳，也就把心里话告诉了他。我说：‘管财务责任重大，厂子里的进进出出，全担在一个人身上，这样的事儿，应该让党员管。’裴仁严肃地对我说：‘你是副厂长，是厂子里的领导人，这里没有什么政府不信任你的问题，而是你不信任政府。’这话我回去想了好久，越想越感到公方代表说的对。事实上，合营初期，工人对私方人员参加领导是不服气的，什么事情都去找公方代表。裴仁在处理这些问题时很大胆很果断。不是自己份内的事就顶回去，不管私方公方，该谁管就找谁。日久，工人们的看法也就慢慢的变了。
      “第二个时期，双方接触的机会多了，一般说顾虑是打消了，但心里还有许多地方不服气。我们这些人，在旧社会多读了几年书，文化上是强一些，也有一些老经验老包袱，有时感到自己很行。老裴只念过四年书，长期在农村工作。可是他的原则性很强，很注意方式。如我在管财务的时候，一次一个工人来向我借钱，我说，这是制度，不能借。后来这个工人把我骂了一顿。当时我又气又恨。心想：千不怪万不怪，只怪自己头上戴了这顶资本家的帽子，如果是公方代表，你们就不敢这样了。后来裴仁一调查，说这件事我只做对了一半，还有一半是不对的。我心里想不通，为了执行制度，错从何来？裴仁说：‘工人无故借支，为了遵守制度不借这是对的，可是，不久以前，有个私方向你借支，你却借给他了，这就不对了。’我仔细一想，原来工人骂我是有原因的，首先是自己破坏了制度。在处理这件事情的时候，老裴对我进行了批评，也对工人进行了教育。他虽然批评了我，可是我们的关系却比过去密切了。此后，我遇事也就不像过去那样自信了，有问题首先检查自己。对老裴也就更加信任了。
      “第三个时期，是积极要求学会管理社会主义企业的时期。民主管理、群众路线，这在私营企业来说，经理或厂长是不可能去考虑这些问题的。然而，合营以后，企业的性质变了，不学会这一些，就不能当好企业的领导人。在这方面，老裴对我的帮助是很大的。我在厂子里兼管总务。我管伙食，自己却宁可下小馆子也不在食堂里吃饭。有时老裴也陪我去吃一两次馆子。他吃馆子并不是只为陪我，而是借吃饭之便说服我，要我关心职工的伙食，并建议我在食堂吃饭，以便随时了解饭菜的质量。后来，我在食堂吃了几次，亲身感到工人们反映伙食搞得不好的意见是正确的。这时老裴建议抽出得力的干部下厨房，具体帮助，并指名要抽总务科李培治。当时，我心里大为不满。李培治是个大学生，工作又积极肯干，叫这样的人去搞鸡毛蒜皮的事情，不是浪费人才吗？后来，这个同志下厨房去了，没几天，伙食搞好了，工人们很满意，纷纷写墙报写信表扬李培治。通过这件事，我学到了两点。一点，我平常把群众观点看得很抽象，其实，把群众最关心的事情搞好了，就是很好的群众观点。另一点，过去我总认为做轰轰烈烈的事才是光荣的，现在才体会到不管任何细小的工作，做好了，群众拥护了，都是光荣的。
      “老裴经常下车间，但是他并没有给我们分派下车间的任务。我是负责原材料供应的。一次在交谈第三分厂材料供应情况时，我肯定地说材料不成问题。当时老裴没说什么，拉着我的手说：‘咱们下去瞧瞧吧！’一进三分厂的门，分厂长就说：‘厂长、副厂长来啦！材料问题可大啦！’我弄得莫名其妙：材料早就批拨给他们了，为什么还在闹停工待料哩？后来一打听，才知道把送给三分厂的材料错送到一分厂去了。事后老裴对我说：‘我们领导人仅仅守着办公室，工作是搞不好的，今后得多下车间。’老裴这人，每逢刮风下雨就披上雨衣到工人宿舍去转一圈，看看那儿漏雨，那儿需要修理。冬天，越是刮风下雪，他跑得越勤，看炉子的烟囱装好没有，会不会出问题。老裴曾说：‘越往工人中间跑，和工人的感情就越深。’当时我领会不了这个意思，后来自己下去了几趟，认识到了它的好处，从此就主动下去了。
      “向公方代表学习的东西可多啰，和老裴相处，也确是学到了不少的东西。有一次，我们厂子接受了一批配电箱的生产任务，图纸是我厂设计的，也经过甲方看过同意了。后来出厂的产品甲方说不合用，要求返修。这时，私方人员认为责任不在我们，不愿意修，老裴却对大家说：甲方是外行，我们是内行，错了我们也有责任；何况我们生产的目的是为社会主义经济建设服务的，甲方不好使，对建设也不利。他就说了这么短短的几句话，可把我们合营企业的优越性全说出来了。把大家的认识大大提高了一步。”
    最后，我们的谈话快结束了，柏岳告诉我说，裴仁正在跟他学算术，他们还一道在学习政治经济学。
    在分别时，他概括了以上的谈话说：“几年来，在工作中我个人碰了不少的钉子，回想起来，碰一回钉子就等于破一回资本主义，也就是立一回社会主义。这些破和立，如果没有公方代表的帮助，不是不破不立，就是有破无立。合营这几年，我们私方人员等于上了一堂大课。党和政府给我们讲了课，公方代表就是课堂上的辅导员。”
