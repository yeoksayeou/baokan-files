Title: Leadership Departments are Both Ignorant and Brutal: Jiangsu Province's Opera Flower Does Not Bloom Profusely

The Jiangsu province's opera flower is not blooming luxuriantly because, according to many people in the opera community here, the main reason is that the provincial cultural leadership departments are both ignorant of opera art and treat opera work in a crude manner with simple administrative orders.

    A symposium on opera work was held by the Xinhua Daily on the 14th of this month. At the meeting, opera worker Wang Ranye said: Kunqu Opera was originally a local opera genre in Jiangsu. In 1951, the Guofeng Kunsu Opera Troupe requested to be taken in by the province, but the leadership excluded Kunqu Opera from Jiangsu. When they came to Nanjing to perform, they were treated coldly. Later, this troupe performed "Fifteen Strings of Cash" in Beijing, which saved this opera genre. The cultural leadership departments treat veteran artists even more officiously. Zhao Tongsheng (Furongcao), a famous Peking Opera teacher known as "North Wang and South Zhao," was idled in Nanjing for more than two years. He had no opportunity to teach opera, and even finding housing was a problem. Later, the Northeast Academy of Chinese Opera sent someone to invite him, and he trained many actors.

    Zhu Tong said: My dramatic creation life has been suffocated.

    The leaders of the Jiangsu Provincial Cultural Bureau take a cold attitude towards opera creation and the rearrangement of plays and are sometimes suppressed. Professor Zhu Tong said: I used to work in drama. In the past few years after liberation, a kind of invisible advice made me leave the drama garden and was forced to become a literary critic. In 1951, I created "A Family of Scholars," but the Southern Jiangsu Federation of Literary and Art Circles wanted me to examine myself. Later, I wrote a satirical comedy "Doctor Jia's Troubles," but the Jiangsu Federation of Literary and Art Circles was unwilling to even mimeograph a few copies to discuss it. The publishing house gave the script to the doctors, but the doctors were not satisfied, so it was not published. In the past few years, my dramatic creation life has almost been suffocated. Jin Zhenyu said: The play "Mrs. Diao Liu" was banned after liberation. After being adapted and rearranged by the Provincial Yangzhou Opera Troupe, it was performed well, but the leadership arbitrarily refused to allow it to be staged, and even the request for a guest performance was rejected. Actually, what is there to fear from letting it "bloom" for a while?

    Unable to support ballad singers.
    Many opera workers have appealed, saying that Jiangsu is unable to support ballad singers. Chen Beihai, a ballad singer from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, said: In the past, famous ballad singers such as Gao Yuanjun were all in Nanjing. In 1955, the Tianjin Ballad Troupe came, including Ma Baolu, but they all left. Cui Jinlan, a qin player from Xuzhou, could not survive in Xuzhou, and even his sister could not perform. He came to the army, and his mother and sister also went to Tianjin. Why can't the artists of Jiangsu take root in this province but blossom in other places? Xiao Yiwu, Deputy Director of the Nanjing Municipal Cultural Bureau, said: There are many Suzhou Pingtan artists with a wide mass base, and there are also many Xuzhou and Nanjing ballad singers, but the leadership has ignored them. In 1953, I requested assistance for Yangzhou storyteller Wang Shaotang's oral recording of "Water Margin," which recorded millions of words, but the second step of how to organize it has been shelved again.

    Strangling the development of music work
    If the leadership does not lead opera, then they pay even less attention to music work. Musician Bao Huisun said: The Cultural Bureau doesn't know how many people are in charge of music. Jiangsu is not weak, but the leadership does not pay attention to it, strangling the development of music work. After the national erhu master, blind man A Bing, returned to Jiangsu after recording in Beijing, he starved to death; a female guqin player sold her guqin; and many musicians have not been in music positions for a long time, and some have been squeezed out. Those full-time cadres who lead music throughout the province only care about their own creations, and mass music activities cannot be carried out. Middle school music teachers are a great force, but no one has paid attention to them. Last year, in order to participate in the National Music Week, submissions were widely solicited from the masses. There were many submissions, but no one went to process them. Participation in Music Week was contracted by a few people. As a result, Jiangsu Province's music performance was the second worst in the country, which is really heartbreaking.

### 领导部门既不懂又粗暴  江苏省戏曲之花放得不盛

    领导部门既不懂又粗暴
    江苏省戏曲之花放得不盛
    本报南京17日电　江苏省戏曲之花为什么“放”得不茂盛？这里的戏曲界不少人士认为：主要是省文化领导部门既不懂得戏曲艺术，又以简单的行政命令粗暴地对待戏曲工作。
    在本月14日新华日报召开了戏曲工作座谈会。会上，戏曲工作者王染野说：昆剧原是江苏的地方剧种。1951年国风昆苏剧团曾要求本省收留他们，领导上把昆曲摒斥到江苏以外，来南京演出又遭到冷待，后来这个剧团在北京演出了一出“十五贯”，才救活了这个戏种。文化领导部门对待老艺人更是一付官派。被盛称为“北王南赵”的京剧著名教师赵桐珊（芙蓉草），被闲搁在南京两年多，想教戏没有机会，甚至连住房子都成问题，后来，东北戏曲研究院专人请去，培养了不少演员。
    朱彤说：我的话剧创作生命被窒息了。
    江苏省文化局领导上对戏曲创作和整理剧目采取冷淡的态度，有时还要受到压制。教授朱彤说：我过去是搞话剧的，解放后几年来一种无形的劝告，使我离开话剧园地，被逼变为文艺评论者了。1951年我创作了“书香人家”，苏南文联却要我检讨。后来，我又写了讽刺喜剧“贾医生的苦恼”，江苏文联连油印几份讨论一下都不肯，出版社把剧本给医生看，医生不满意，就不出版了。几年来，我的话剧创作生命几乎被窒息了。金震舆说：“刁刘氏”这个戏解放后禁演的，省扬剧团经过改编整理，排演好了，可是领导上武断不让上演，连要求招待演出也遭拒绝。其实让它“放”一“放”怕什么呢？
    养不住曲艺艺人
    江苏养不住曲艺艺人，很多戏曲工作者提出了呼吁。解放军某部曲艺工作者陈北海说：过去，高元钧等有名曲艺演员都在南京，1955年来了天津曲艺队，马宝禄也在内，结果都走了。徐州琴师艺人崔金兰在徐州活不下去，连他妹妹也不能演出，他到部队来了，母亲、妹妹也到了天津。为什么江苏的艺人，却不能在本省生根，而在外地开花呢？南京市文化局副局长萧亦五说：苏州的评弹艺人多，群众基础广泛，徐州、南京曲艺艺人也不少，领导上却忽视了。1953年我曾要求帮助扬州说书艺人王少堂进行“水浒”口头记录工作，记录了几百万字，可是第二步如何整理又搁浅了。
    扼杀音乐工作的开展
    如果说领导上不领导戏曲，那么对于音乐工作就更不上眼了。音乐工作者鲍蕙荪说：文化局不知有几分之几的一个人在管理音乐。江苏不是力量薄弱，而是领导不重视，扼杀了音乐工作的开展。全国二胡名手瞎子阿炳到北京录音后，回到江苏竟饿死了；一位女古琴家卖了古琴；许多音乐家也长期不在音乐岗位上，有的被排挤在外。那些领导全省音乐的专职干部只顾自己创作，群众音乐活动无法开展，中学音乐教师是一批很大的力量，可是谁也没有注意他们。去年为了参加全国音乐周，广泛征求群众来稿，来稿很多，却没有人去处理。参加音乐周由少数人包办。结果，江苏省的音乐表演在全国是倒数第二，真是很痛心的。
